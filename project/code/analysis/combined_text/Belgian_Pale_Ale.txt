with

after
the
swallow
this
beer
was
one
that
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
in
overall
enjoyment
not
the
belgian
style
i
was
looking
for
perhaps
not
bad
but
nothing
about
it
stands
out
worth
a
try
i
guess
the
funk
threw
me
off
at
first
but
grew
on
me
by
about

spices
are
quite

low
alcohol
is
kinda
nice
as
there
is
no

taste
whatsoever
good
for
what
it
is
pretty
good
tasting
ale
i
would
buy
again
o
overall

and

of
a

sessionable
overall
this
being
my
first
beer
in
the
belgian
style
realm
i
liked
it
a
lot
its
not
that
heavy
of
a
beer
and
very
drinkable
that
being
said
it
isnt
too
complex
which
i
believe
makes
it
good
for
those
who
want
to
get
into
belgian
style
ales
got
to
try
on
tap
fresh
from
the
brewery
the
other
day
and
i
thought
it
was
very
nice
the
appearance
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
wheat
and
banana
to
it
the
taste
was
similar
with
great
notes
of
banana
and
even
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
feel
of
the
beer
was
a
little
light
but
refreshing
in
the
heat
would
definitely
get
again
a
little
bit
of
a
miss
here
from
cl

a
fairly
good
version
of
a
belgium
pale

could
drink
all
day

on

all
in

a

to
find

anyone
that

were

at
the

to
try
some
the

had
a
yeasty
mustiness
to
it
that
created
a
cheesy
slightly
floweryperfumelike
scent
mouthfeel
was
slightly
full
thanks
to
a
huge
effervescence
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
absolutely
driven
by
the
yeast
kind
of

kind
of
perfumey
the
bottle
mentioned
spice
but
it
was
difficult
to
parse
where
the
spice
began
and
the
yeast
ended
was
the
addition
of
spice
a
case
of
gilding
the
lily
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
was
not
mind
blowing
the
finish
was
semidry
and
i
was
again
wondering
whether
this
was
a
byproduct
of
the
yeast
the
spice
or
both
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
beer
make
this
a
beer
a
really
nice
sensory
experience
as
a
pale
ale
the
abv
is
not
as
strong
as
a
double
or
tripel
style
belgian
so
its
a
bit
more
easygoing
that
said
its
so
full
of
flavor
that
i
tend
to
sip
rather
than
guzzle
this
relatively
light
bodied
brew
overall
another
excellent
offering
from
this
brewer
the
flavours
are
bright
and
refreshing

cant

its
the
magic
in

talking
now
overall
the
spices
bring
a
fun
and
fascinating
twist
to
this
bpa
although
they
seem
slightly
out
of
place
in
the
absence
of
hops
in
the
end
however
this
is
a
tasty
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
never
pass
up
o
liquid
gold
is
a
solid
and
then
some
belgian
pale

with
a
good

of

and

character
to
provide
an
interesting
brew
amazing
light
beer
served
9oz
at

in

ny
great
mouthfeel
and
cant
say
enough
about
how
beautiful
the

is
in
the
sunlight
the
attention
to
detail
with
the
apple
subtleties
is
striking
in
a
good

i
loved
this
beer
please
try
it
if
you
can
find
a
good

a

a

take
it
into
a
sweet
finish
no
real
aftertaste
very
light
body
almost
thin
with
a
little
carbonation
to
gently
remind
you
this
is
beer
pretty
nice
overall
a
beer
that
i
will
not
revisit
again
it
is
only
a
difference
in
opinion
here
but
the
herbs
and
spices
that
they
used
are
a
bit
overdone
and
the
yeasty
quality
hops
and
malts
are
lost
underneath
them
on
tap
at
the
blue
monk
a
lighter
belgian
ale
pours
deep
yellow
to
golden
colour
with
a
minimum
head
carbonation
bubbles
yeast
is
the
characteristic
as
it
warms
i
can
distinguish
a
tad
of
funk
spiciness
featuring
clove
true
to
style
but
something
needed
to
distinguish
itself
in
this
style
o
very
very
nice
beer
already
planning
on
a
six
of
this
in
the
summer
cant
wait
whyd
they
filter
it
only
real
ding
against
this
beer
pours
a
fairly
thin
head
of
bone
white
mostly
tiny
bubbles
which
dissolve
off
swiftly
the
lacing
likewise
close
to
nonexistent
the
liquid
is
a
shimmeringly
bright
yellow
fully
transparent
only
a
few
bubble
beads
but
these
are
highly
active
very
expressive
nose
of
banana
strawberry
apple
fruit
clove
and
cinnamon
bubblegum
and
all
kinds
of
general
yeastiness
undercurrent
of
powdered
milk
chocolate
here
too
it
is
pure
and
unblemished
preferring
a
spring
to
its
step
than
grounding
itself
firmly
light
to
mediumbodied
fluid
with
a
sort
of
metallic
ring
to
it
at
first
which
makes
the
attack
somewhat
bitter
the
carbonation
churns
steadily
and
agitates
more
than
lets
the
underlying
creaminess
take
hold
white
pepper
and
lemon
peel
beat
the
clove
nutmeg
allspice
to
the
punch
eventually
turns
more
resinous
in
feel
which
brings
out
more
yellow
apple
peach
banana
melon
fruit
that
cocoa
maltiness
persists
a
lot
going
on
retronasally
lower
yeast
presence
more
unbaked
dough
than
bread
or
scone
etc
and
certainly
outpaced
by
the
grassy
nip
overall
its
pleasing
to
quaff
guileless
and
simple
to
the
verge
of
innocence
youd
lose
interest
after
a
couple
of
dates
pours
clear
see
through
golden
hued
very
little
foam
remains
belgian
yeast
strain
nose
light
fruit
taste
is
smooth
yet
bitter
firm
hoppiness
throughout
but
balanced
into

firm
carbonation
in
the
mixture
this
is
a
good
beer
deceptively
simple
not
a
lot
of
flavor
coming
through
i
just
dont
pick
up
the
belgian
in
this
one
clear
pale
golden
with
no
head
the
nose
is
pure
bubblegum
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
artificial
smelling
fruity
esters
the
taste
has
a
honey
sweetness
and
of
course
bubblegum
some
white
grape
this
is
a
beer
that
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
drinkable
slightly
bitter
with
a
honey
sweetness
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
and
drinks
like
a
strangely
flavored
lager
overall
another
tasty
captain
lawrence
been
impressed
with
everything
from
them
so
far
recommended
to
any
belgian
fans
o
a
pleasant
and
crisp
beer
for
those
looking
for
a
lighter
version
of
your
favorite
belgian
ale
not
risking
much
but
hitting
the
mark
where
it
tries
id
say
give
it
a
whirl
and
dont
expect
the
world
cheers
overall
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
bpa
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
mustiness
is
throwing
me
off
this
brew
is
out
of
balance
and
could
use
refining
recommended
but
not
over
the
top
glad
i
tired
it
but
i
believe
cl
would
do
better
on
their
next
brew
a
most
impressive
americanmade
belgian
pale
ale
that
soars
above
many
others
in
its
complexity
and
subtleties
i
so
badly
wish
i
had
at
least
one
more
of
these
to
enjoy
when
this
ones
finally
kicked
the
bucket
o
this
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
mixture
of
belgian
yeast
and
fruit
flavors
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
blending
the
better
bits
of
witbier
saison
and
belgian
pale
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
actually
quite
an
excellent
crack
at
a

poured

clearish

and
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
my
next
one
the
most
pleasantly
drinkable
belgian
ale
ive
had
this
is
certainly
not
a
typical
belgian
pale
but
the
style
is
certainly
very
variable
this
is
a
nice
combination
of
belgian
yeast
and
what
tastes
like
american
hops
nothing
dominates
as
this
is
nicely
balanced
and
its
very
drinkable
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
bottle
beer
recently
introduced
much
better
than
many
highly
ranked
competitors
beer
has
excellent
aroma
clarity
and
overall
taste
performance
new
bottle
design
and
sale
of
beer
in
grocery
stores
is
a
huge
plus
since
had
to
go
to
brewery
in
the
past
to
get
this
beer
odall
of
captain
lawrences
sixpack
line
are
exceptionally
well
crafted
but
they
do
not
crack
the
awesome
stratosphere
this
actually
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
group
its
a
nice
little
belgianinspired
brew
its
the
epitome
of
good
but
not
great
overall
an
interesting
belgian
style
ale
i
find
it
is
more
like
a
french
saison
so
perhaps
its
a
francobelgian
ale
in
any
case
it
is
quite
good
for
a
blonde
ale
this
is
pretty
fantastic
feels
a
bit
heavier
than
most
but
goes
down
so
easy
its
like
drinking
wait
for
it
liquid
gold
drink
it
was
a
nice
little
beer
the
abv
sat
about
right
but
was
more
prevalant
when
the
beer
warmed
md
lively
effervescent
on
the
tongue
the
yeastyspicyness
will
offer
a
lot
of
flavor
to
those
who
enjoy
craft
beer
but
are
turned
off
by
big
hoppy
bitterness
o
not
very
impressive
seems
kind
of
like
a
mess
as
its
overtly
sweet
it
just
leaves
a
really
long
and
lasting
syrupy
sweetness
that
gets
nauseating
really
quickly
o
nice
and
refreshing
but
i
prefer
their
kolsch
as
a
summer
beer
would
like
to
try
this
a
little
fresher
oif
the
palate
could
have
lived
up
to
the
nose
this
beer
would
be
phenomenal
when
i
took
my
first
sniff
i
thought
id
be
drainpouring
this
one
however
its
flavor
and
mouthfeel
were
pretty
decent
o
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
at
the
brewery
itself
my
first
reaction
was
wow
more
than
just
a
hint
of
banana
and
i
loved
it
ive
never
gotten
the
taste
of
banana
since
then
but
i
was
also
in
the
hot
sun
drinking
other
cl
brews
and
eating
some
very
good
bbq
so
who
knows
how
that
may
have
played
on
my
palate
however
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
bit
yet
it
is
very
refreshing
o
a
delicious
american
take
on
the
style
i
gotta
try
more
captain
lawrence
the
beers
ive
had
from
them
have
been
outstanding
this
is
a
flavorful
bpa
but
it
has
too
much
coriander
presence
for
my
liking
i
rather
the
yeast
come
through
more
o
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
lots
of
good
yeast
derived
flavors
spicy
and
fruity
good
balance
good
to
see
this
in
12oz
bottles
now
overall
actually
i
enjoyed
this
and
im
not
a
huge
belgian
beer
fan
i
like
the
almost
over
spiced
quality
and
that
this
took
precedent
to
the
belgian
yeasts
the
fruity
esters
and
flavors
were
also
quite
nice
an
enjoyable
beer
o
overall
not
as
magical
as
i
remember
but
still
quite
good
for
an
american
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
worth
checking
out
and
im
sure
this
wont
the
last
6er
of
this
that
i
pick
up
glad
they
released
this
seems
run
of
the
mill
for
this
style
other
better
beers
o
perfect
beer
to
ring
in
the
nice
spring
weather
here
good
but
nothing
id
seek
out
o
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
and
could
enjoy
multiple
of
these
in
a
session
i
really
like
the
white
pepper
hints
in
this
beer
a
lot
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
feel
it
is
a
little
too
spicy
for
the
style
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
to
long
and
not
dry
enough
it
is
almost
more
like
a
blond
then
a
pale
still
it
tastes
good
just
not
as
to
style
as
i
like
overall

very
nice
straightforward
belgian
pale
ale
others
aiming
for
this
style
should
use
this
as
a
reference
point
also
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
rare
beers
where
you
can
really
get
a
sense
of
what
belgian
yeast
does
for
beer
taking
what
would
otherwise
be
a
relatively
plain
straightforward
beer
and
making
it
a
really
winning
bpa
lovely
beer
and
ill
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
future
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
but
definitly
drinks
smooth
and
bright
with
a
nice
clean
finish
m
leaves
mouth
feeling
dry
nice
carbonation
light
body
nags
head
in
huntington
pouts
this
in
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
with
a
creamy
white
one
inch
head
the
name
liquid
gold
comes
from
the
color
of
the
beer
though
its
not
a
clear
beer
it
is
translucent
but
cloudy
on
the
nose
you
smell
aromas
of
raisins
sweetness
a
hint
of
honey
our
first
taste
does
not
disappoint
us
with
its
complexity
a
very
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
that
is
very
subdued
but
helps
clear
the
sweetness
the
beer
is
substantial
but
not
fullbodied
a
very
good
drinking
beer
i
remember
trying
this
at
the
brewery
the
first
time
i
went
there
but
didnt
get
a
growler
fill
i
kicked
myself
in
the
ass
when
i
got
home
now
that
i
got
myself
a
growler
fill
im
glad
i
did
but
it
tastes
better
on
tap
the
only
problem
with
this
brew
is
the
immediate
taste
is
wow
but
then
it
begins
to
dull
down
a
bit
as
the
consumption
continues
i
would
have
given
a
higher
rating
otherwise
a
tasty
solid
brew
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
its
almost
a
belgian
singlecream
aleenglish
pale
blend
with
a
bucketload
of
clove
ill
give
it
props
its
original
as
hell
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
this
in
sixers
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
slightly
opaque
thick
head
that
dissipates
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
has
a
fruity
nose
with
tones
of
yeast
and
spice
the
flavor
is
bittersweet
lemon
citrus
with
a
lot
of
spices
and
some
malt
very
well
blended
together
has
a
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
despite
the
creamy
head
not
to
carbonated
either
a
very
unusual
beer
with
a
unique
and
excellent
flavor
serving
type
ontapgrowler
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
and
enjoyable
im
glad
i
didnt
overlook
it
like
i
did
yesterday
and
grabbed
a
growler
for
15
which
was
a
few
ounces
over
the
64oz
marker
i
would
purchase
again
cheers
if
youre
chugging
this
beer
then
you
are
clearly
a
drunk
and
b
not
paying
for
it
as
a
reviewer
this
made
me
question
whether
i
should
grade
it
worse
because
this
shouldnt
be
called
as
a
pale
type
i
liked
it
so
it
received
good
grades
o
a
decent
brew
i
might
have
another
one
overall
a
sublimly
light
and
clean
sessionable
ale
o
pretty
good
nice
belgian
golden
malts
bit
of
yeast
on
the
nose
doesnt
help
nice
light
hop
flavors
and
nice
belgian
flavors
overall
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
and
then
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
bready
malt
and
also
a
bit
of
banana
and
clove
yeasty
spice
is
mild
but
present
flavor
again
is
pretty
good
but
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
mild
fruit
and
bread
the
body
detracts
from
the
taste
as
its
really
too
full
and
a
bit
too
sweet
id
like
this
one
thinner
and
dryer
pretty
good
but
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
d
so
if
this
is
only
the
beginning
where
will
captain
lawrence
take
us
next
this
is
a
great
thirst
quenching
bpa
the
hybrid
approach
with
styles
makes
this
an
incredible
taste
experience
i
will
be
coming
back
for
more
overall
i
enjoyed
it
went
very
well
with
my
bacon
bbq
burger
i
would
definitely
try
again
i
feel
like
having
it
a
second
time
would
enable
me
to
dive
deeper
into
the
beer
and
pick
out
more
distinct
flavors
d
extremely
drinkable
the
fruit
flavors
are
very
refreshing
and
well
balanced
very
nice
flavor
and
feel
drinkability
this
beer
paired
excellently
with
my
steak
sandwich
in
nyc
and
was
extremely
enjoyable
overall
even
though
this
is
a
beer
i
am
unable
to
get
a
hold
of
in
my
area
it
did
spark
my
interest
in
trying
more
from
this
brewery
when
i
have
the
opportunity
again
as
this
was
quite
a
well
made
belgian
style
ale
dtasty
and
easy
to
drink
balanced
and
enjoyable
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
yeast
strand
and
would
like
a
drier
finish
but
still
tasty
this
is
a
bpa
i
really
like
it
has
the
look
aroma
and
smell
i
look
for
in
the
style
its
got
a
good
golden
color
but
the
head
isnt
quite
as
tall
as
i
had
hoped
retention
was
good
as
was
lacing
smells
just
as
expected
spicy
and
earthy
yeast
with
the
obvious
malt
aroma
has
plenty
of
that
spice
come
forthcloves
pepper
and
even
coriander
come
to
mind
medium
body
and
decent
drinkability
overall
d
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
the
day
i
was
able
to
take
it
home
in
a
growler
so
hopefully
it
holds
up
for
a
day
or
two
drinkability
high
this
is
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
offering
from
captain
lawrence
served
at
rattle
n
hum
i
enjoyed
this
ontap
at
trinity
grill
and
bar
i
believe
id
had
it
at
waterfront
ale
house
before
or
perhaps
just
heard
good
things
about
it
i
found
it
to
be
so
delicious
as
to
be
elevated
above
most
of
the
beers
ive
ever
had
it
was
goldenbrown
and
quickly
gone
d
a
pretty
good
belgian
style
beer
some
nice
banana
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
drinkability
all
day
and
all
night
as
i
watched
the
guy
behind
the
bar
pull
this
from
the
tap
my
heart
leapt
when
i
saw
he
stopped
when
there
was
a
twoinch
head
on
the
beer
then
my
heart
sank
as
he
resumed
pouring
letting
the
head
run
down
the
glass
until
there
was
about
half
an
inch
left
sheesh
so
much
for
aroma
what
i
could
detect
was
rather
wheatbeerish
some
cloves
and
bananas
maybe
some
lemons
decent
lightamber
color
too
very
nice
taste
with
spicy
oranges
and
other
citrus
ambling
arminarm
with
light
bananas
and
some
hay
lemons
came
to
the
fore
especially
in
the
aftertaste
lightly
carbonated
with
zing
not
sting
this
was
a
nice
find
on
the
aah
list
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
of
the
american
bpas
ive
had
this
was
by
far
the
most
drinkable
not
overly
bitter
or
hamfistedly
hopped
but
nicely
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
very
easy
drinking
with
a
dry
finish
d
i
love
this
beer
i
have
some
great
memories
associated
with
it
it
is
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
just
drinks
like
a
champ
in
the
summer
only
got
this
because
they
were
out
of
the
dipa
but
this
beer
is
a
winner
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
on
draft
immediately
after
the
freshchester
and
although
its
not
as
good
as
the
pale
ale
it
is
interesting
and
has
very
accessible
belgian
qualities
that
could
be
a
good
gateway
for
some
the
color
is
also
an
interesting
cloudy
peach
that
i
enjoyed
this
time
liquid
gold
must
be
drinkable
because
i
finished
the
growler
myself
i
wouldnt
reach
for
it
for
a
refreshing
summer
day
beer
as
it
does
have
some
strength
and
the
yeasty
nose
got
tiring
towards
the
end
still
id
like
to
get
another
fill
of
this
soon
growler
from
brewery
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
head
on
it
that
dies
off
rather
quickly
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
grassy
citrusy
and
spicy
aroma
the
taste
is
a
touch
light
slightly
spicy
coriander
to
the
taste
some
malts
and
extremely
faint
hops
just
a
very
nice
lighter
beer
aromas
are
of
belgian
yeasty
spiciness
lemon
rind
and
bready
malt
i
could
say
lemon
pepper
but
that
might
be
pushing
it
as
nick
noted
a
whisper
of
some
herbalgrassy
hops
the
taste
has
some
residual
sugar
but
is
mostly
composed
of
prominent
yeast
character
contributing
this
prominent
spiciness
and
floral
component
over
some
graininess
a
nice
moderate
level
of
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
and
creates
a
certain
crispness
to
this
brew
pretty
approachable
and
a
solid
offering
i
will
continue
to
fill
up
my
growler
with
this
brew
to
share
with
friends
in
the
summer
months
had
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
when
i
tried
this
one
actually
thought
it
was
an
ipa
at
first
because
of
the
great
hoppy
flavor
but
realised
that
it
was
so
much
more
after
a
few
sips
really
smooth
and
complex
flavor
with
an
excellent
aroma
and
delicate
head
draft
at
bierria
paradiso
dc
o
very
drinkable
and
nice
d
its
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
an
every
day
beer
for
me
but
its
complex
and
solid
the
pony
bar
manhattan
poured
a
nice
semihazy
gold
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
a
very
thin
white
head
but
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
fairly
standard
mix
for
a
belgian
golden
beer
banana
clove
and
allspice
the
taste
was
a
much
more
magnified
version
of
the
aroma
with
also
a
hint
of
lemon
and
grains
of
paradise
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
since
this
was
packed
with
flavor
id
certainly
be
open
to
sessioning
this
beer
well
done
drinkability
a
solid
fresh
and
tasty
version
of
a
bpa
good
flavors
and
highly
sessionable
id
like
to
get
some
more
happy
thanksgiving
d
goes
down
easy
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
to
sip
on
these
last
warm
days
notes
very
goodbut
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
sugar
bombbut
a
bit
different
than
some
others
i
have
tried
all
in
all
an
easy
beer
to
drink
notes
eminently
drinkable
belgian
pale
nothing
amazing
but
no
complaints
whatsoever
definitely
the
tastiest
beer
available
by
the
halfyard
at
richters
d
cpt
lawrence
is
a
good
brewery
so
i
wont
knock
the
goods
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
liquid
gold
its
an
interesting
semitasty
brew
for
an
american
version
of
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
agree
that
its
the
best
representation
of
it
out
there
give
it
a
shot
and
see
for
yourself
found
this
happily
at
rosie
tomorrows
in
danbury
ct
on
tap
and
poured
cold
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
a
modest
white
cover
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasant
clove
and
light
lemon
bread
nothing
real
provoking
suggesting
a
belgian
style
the
flavor
brings
a
strong
herbal
hop
married
to
heavy
clove
this
is
a
pretty
heavy
constitution
spicey
tangy
with
a
dry
hop
finish
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
just
a
slight
overtone
of
bubblegum
that
gives
way
to
biscuit
wheat
grain
goodness
fairly
drinkable
depending
upon
your
partiality
for
the
style
not
really
my
favorite
though
they
seem
to
have
come
up
with
something
that
is
a
slight
compromise
to
those
of
us
that
dont
feast
regularly
on
the
belgian
faire
all
in
all
pretty
impressive
t
good
bitter
beer
but
its
balanced
well
with
malty
undertones
to
it
the
spice
is
really
good
peppery
drinkability
is
excellent
the
refreshing
nature
and
clear
wonderful
flavor
of
this
marvelous
brew
make
it
superbly
quaffable
d
low
in
abv
the
growler
was
easy
to
finish
although
i
could
of
used
some
help
i
love
to
share
i
just
wish
there
was
more
to
this
im
going
to
try
the
xtra
gold
and
see
what
that
has
to
offer
d
this
is
a
great
brew
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
frutiness
to
it
i
think
of
stone
ve
08
with
the
fruity
characters
excellant
job
drinkability
is
good
the
yeast
was
a
bit
dominating
when
i
tried
it
but
its
still
a
better
than
average
beer
by
all
accounts
nicely
done
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
but
accessible
and
nicely
drinkable
great
stuff
and
highly
recommended
d
what
a
nice
beer
poured
on
321
fedexd
to
me
and
enjoyed
on
325
with
nary
a
hint
of
oxidation
thanks
joe
looking
forward
to
more
indeed
on
tap
from
rattle
and
hum
ny
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
one
a
slightly
cloudy
light
yellow
color
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
may
have
been
pour
not
sure
very
active
carbonation
though
very
slight
smell
of
hops
thick
consistency
to
taste
almost
syruplike
malty
sweet
with
a
little
hops
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
terrible
but
not
my
favorite
either
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
as
all
the
flavors
blended
together
very
well
d
def
a
session
beer
like
hoegaarden
with
some
muscles
easy
drinking
would
love
to
pair
this
with
some
food
i
just
bought
this
on
tap
at
the
great
bobbique
in
patchouge
it
looked
gold
like
a
miller
high
life
but
boy
it
aint
no
light
lager
the
place
has
a
great
beer
list
but
i
stuck
with
this
just
so
tasty
and
real
drinkablility
fk
you
bud
light
you
couldnt
taste
this
good
unless
you
put
a
20
in
every
bottle
seek
this
stuff
out

oh
and
by
the
way
this
growler
has
been
in
my
cellar
for
just
over
a
month
scott
vaccaro
has
done
the
world
of
beer
a
huge
service
with
this
one
thank
you
d
the
spice
is
a
little
strong
making
it
a
bit
of
a
sipper
in
spite
of
its
nice
light
appearance
www
theviceblog
com
the
drinkability
is
very
solid
a
great
beer
glad
i
tried
it
recommended
been
in
nyc
all
weekend
and
just
have
really
been
digging
this
beer
so
fruity
and
glyceryl
on
the
palate
floral
spicey
belgian
yeasty
as
hell
usually
i
dont
like
an
over
the
top
belgian
yeast
and
spicey
brew
but
this
one
has
something
different
to
it
love
the
character
and
refreshing
quality
this
beer
contains
flavors
are
what
the
nose
suggested
a
great
summer
beer
overall
a
good
spicy
sipper
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
another
good
warm
afternoon
beer
dthis
is
always
nice
to
have
on
tap
and
is
probably
the
most
common
of
the
captains
offerings
around
nyc
oh
yeah
i
almost
forgot
mrbendo
kicks
ass
d
a
bit
high
on
the
abv
for
a
session
beer
but
the
carbonation
keeps
it
light
enough
on
the
tongue
to
foll
you
into
thinking
it
could
be
a
session
beer
d
some
may
say
this
is
a
bit
high
abv
for
a
session
beer
but
i
think
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
god
session
very
drinkable
glass
after
glass
pours
a
clear
gold
with
some
head
nose
is
nice
and
sweet
flavor
is
equally
as
good
being
consistently
sweet
and
never
dropping
off
to
anything
sour
metallic
or
negative
at
all
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
on
the
liquid
with
a
bit
of
a
thicker
touch
right
level
of
bubble
extremely
drinkable
i
kind
of
feel
like
this
beer
could
be
a
gateway
beer
for
people
who
are
wary
of
belgian
brews
it
is
also
my
first
trip
into
the
world
of
captain
lawrence
and
i
want
more
beautiful
dtongue
feels
really
dry
after
two
probably
from
the
carbonation
but
im
prolly
going
to
finish
this
growler
after
this
id
drink
it
again
fresh
or
from
the
bottle
to
compare
not
a
bad
beverage
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
easy
drinking
mildly
estery
and
based
in
a
light
drinking
belgian
brew
i
hardly
noticed
the
6
abv
went
down
nicely
pours
an
ultra
light
yellow
color
with
less
than
a
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
nice
lattice
lacing
this
ale
has
less
color
than
any
beer
that
i
have
ever
experienced
including
michultra
the
smell
is
aggressive
and
classic
belgian
yeast
spicy
coriander
and
pepper
light
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
and
complemented
by
a
nice
hop
character
full
flavored
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
lemony
and
earthy
yeast
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
lingering
spiciness
that
is
appropriate
quite
drinkable
and
at
6
abv
its
on
for
this
session
edit
going
up
down
with
every
batch
the
jug
i
had
before
lastfebruary
was
exceptionally
juicy
mildly
carbonated
while
this
recent
tastingapril
was
much
bigger
in
the
hop
department
similar
in
acidity
to
my
original
review
a
4

if
i
wanted
to
jot
down
some
ratings
here
poured
from
a
growler
that
was
acquired
by
a
good
friend
a
couple
of
days
before
sampling
slightly
phenolic
aromas
mixed
in
with
soft
malt
aromas
light
carbonation
kicked
up
a
whisper
of
foam
when
poured
super
light
color
reminiscent
of
a
massed
produced
german
lager
up
front
clove
and
cinnamon
flavors
dominated
which
were
overtaken
by
biscuity
malt
flavor
on
the
backend
and
cleaned
out
by
hop
dryness
didnt
get
any
belgian
aspects
to
the
alcohol
flavors
except
phenolics
no
fruity
esters
or
spicy
alcohol
which
makes
me
wonder
if
a
belgian
yeast
strain
was
used
at
all
not
very
drinkable
to
me
due
to
the
phenolic
character
dominating
the
flavor
profile
very
good
easy
to
drink
and
most
enjoyable
on
a
hot
baltimore
summer
evening
md
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
actually
really
felt
that
a
belgian
could
be
a
response
to
a
pils
although
heavier
in
the
body
than
a
pils
this
is
a
great
beer
and
for
the
alcohol
although
not
too
high
very
light
update
went
back
for
seconds
and
it
pretty
much
tasted
the
same
not
sure
why
but
i
mistook
this
for
cls
tripel
at
first
the
body
was
thick
enough
though
the
flavor
was
a
little
mellow
for
a
big
abv
beer
i
guess
that
makes
a
good
belgian
pale
with
some
body
to
it
the
flavor
was
subtle
and
the
kind
that
went
on
far
through
the
aftertaste
the
aroma
was
hennepinlike
with
funky
barnyard
aromas
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
started
with
a
clean
sweet
candi
flavor
followed
by
a
complex
mix
of
spice
make
that
hot
spice
with
some
pale
grains
coming
through
at
the
end
finishing
with
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
go
forth
and
drink
it
overall
an
enjoyable
and
tasty
ale
i
would
not
have
guessed
it
was
a
bpa
though
very
impressed
with
the
captain
as
usual
i
have
had
this
one
multiple
times
so
it
is
quite
nice
to
sit
down
a
review
it
and
still
be
amazed
these
belgian
pale
ales
golden
ales
are
a
real
favorite
of
mine
and
this
stands
up
drinkability
superb
easy
to
quaff
great
flavor
and
clear
session
beer
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeeking
out
glad
to
see
this
in
nj
a
very
well
made
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
white
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
golden
brew
head
recedes
at
a
moderate
pace
never
really
goes
away
with
a
heavy
coating
of
white
lace
aroma
is
light
of
sweet
and
spicy
not
overdone
just
right
taste
follows
the
nose
finding
a
nicely
balanced
road
through
the
center
of
the
belgianstyle
pale
neighborhood
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
very
smooth
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
the
style
that
i
have
experienced
a
very
good
belgian
style
ale
had
a
couple
on
tap
would
definitely
order
this
one
again
notes
very
similar
to
sixpoints
sweet
action
which
i
prefer
slightly
still
another
fine
offering
from
this
brewery
very
nice
liquid
gold
is
not
overdone
like
so
many
others
superbly
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
from
a
brand
new
brewery
all
i
can
say
is
this
is
a
great
start
if
better
is
to
come
then
well
be
spoiled
rotten
cant
wait
to
try
the
pleasantville
smoked
porter
fresh
growler
picked
up
at
the
brewery
today
pours
light
golden
almost
clear
with
a
slight
but
long
lasting
tiny
bubble
white
head
leaves
minor
splotchy
lacing
after
a
vigorous
swirl
nose
is
of
limes
pepper
and
belgian

this
is
an
easy
drinking
belgian
singlegolden
inspired
ale
notes
of
more
citrus
especially
lime
quinine
and
pepper
crisp
and
refreshing
packs
a
punch
at
6
moderate
hops
till
a
subtle
dryness
arrives
in
the
finish
a
delicate
complex
and
well
crafted
ale
from
the
newest
player
in
the
ny
craft
beer
scene
looking
foward
to
trying
other
styles
from
capt
l
a
really
good
beer
from
allangash
which
never
disappoints
i
would
buy
this
year
round
if
it
were
available
in
my
area

not
sure
why
the
average
ba
score
is
only
an
82
as
i
thought
that
this
was
very
tasty
light
crisp
and
enjoyable
if
this
was
a
yearly
production
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
more
there
were
so
many
lees
that
even
the
slightest
movement
of
the
bottle
would
rouse
them
this
was
going
to
take
a
skillful
steady
hand
in
order
not
to
screw
it
up
now
where
might
i
find
such
a
thing
i
pulled
it
off
but
given
the
resulting
wisps
i
decided
to
again
employ
the
bartenders
trick
this
resulted
in
a
finger
of
fluffy
eggshellwhite
head
that
slowly
fell
back
to
wisps
color
was
again
a
solid
gold
srm
5
and
when
coupled
with
its
nequality
clarity
i
had
a
return
visit
from
midas
mammon
and
croesus
all
wanting
a
sip
and
all
squabbling
about
it
as
is
their
wont
nose
held
a
peppery
spicy
funkiness
leaving
no
doubt
that
it
was
some
sort
of
belgianstyle
beer
the
hops
may
have
fallen
off
in
the
interim
but
i
was
not
really
unwound
mouthfeel
was
medium
taste
was
kind
of
muted
in
comparison
to
the
nose
it
had
a
lemonycitrus
flavor
and
a
light
pepperiness
but
the
promise
of
the
nose
was
simply
not
met
finish
was
semidry
but
i
just
felt
like
it
lacked
any
ooomph
like
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
final
pour
some
nice
murky
mud
in
terms
of
color
nose
held
a
pronounced
funk
flavor
was
only
slightly
better
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
too
hopped
up
with
not
enough
fruitiness
up
front
it
just
seemed
too
bitter
but
maybe
thats
just
me
poorly
done
attempt
at
the
style
i
was
looking
foward
to
this
one
in
the
pack
but
it
was
just
another
flop
pair
it
with
a
cream
of
roasted
carrot
soup
i
give
it
a
75
5100
ok
collaboration
on
tap
at
city
taphouse
in
philly
along
with
other
beer
camp
collabs
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
that
screams
allagash
its
not
really
remarkable
in
any
way
but
its
mellowness
is
refreshing
definitely
worth
a
try
tastepiney
hops
meet
spicy
belgian

leading
to
a

in

very
wellbalanced

it

b
o
an
excellent
colab
very
tasty
for
a
lower
abv
brew
well
done
o
pretty
nice
flavors
are
mild
enough
for
such
a
delicate
beer
and
the
hop
character
isnt
too
over
the
top
oi
envision
this
to
be
more
appealing
to
drink
in
the
summer
on
a
hot
day
but
paired
with
food
by
itself
this
beer
is
a
bit
annoying
i
wouldnt
buy
again
and
probably
wouldnt
drink
a
bottle
again
if
offered
to
me
o
im
generally
not
into
belgian
style
stuff
but
this
was
interesting
especially
when
the
tropical
fruit
notes
shone
through
i
wish
they
made
that
more
of
the
dominant
hop
profile
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
fun
to
try
the
flavor
is
very
herbal
with
slight
phenolic
flavor
carrying
over
from
the
aroma
with
slight
tangy
tropical
fruit
element
with
nice
malt
support
adding
dimension
and
cushioning
the
bitterness
slightly
with
tangy
yeast
adding
an
interesting
contrast
with
light
floral
element
and
resins
from
the
hop
giving
a
subtle
complexity
in
the
finish
overall
i
think
this
is
pretty
great
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
a
nice
hop
forward
belgian
pale
not
intense
but
bitter
to
the
point
it
verges
on
belgian
ipa
just
not
quite
there
i
really
like
the
yeast
flavor
even
if
it
is
on
the
dry
side
nice
flavor
not
too
hoppy
very
reminiscent
of
tripel
karmeliet
overall
nice
take
on
the
style
and
i
like
the
subtle
notes
and
simplicity
of
this
beer
hope
there
is
a
return
to
production
with
this
beer
on
the
future
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
and
how
well
it
held
up
as
i
just
got
my
hands
on
some
beer
camp
bottles
pored
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
little
to
no
head
looked
inviting
aromas
of
grapefruit
pineapple
bananafunk
light
coriander
and
the
classic
sn
bitter
note
that
i
love
tastes
of
fruit
cup
yeah
that
fruit
cup
and
some
orangey
citrus
light
belgian
yeasty
profile
and
nice
balance
classic
sn
job
of
absolutely
nailing
the
mouthfeel
for
the
style
and
leaving
a
nice
aftertaste
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
beer
camps
i
tried
id
jump
on
another
if
i
found
it
brewed
with
coriander
myrons
walk
offers
up
a
faint

a
suggestion
of

and
a

it
pours
a
slight
hazy
gold
under
a
grand
2
stiff
white
head
that
produces
classic
belgian
gothic
window
lace
the
flavor
profile
begins
with
a
slight
sweetness
banana
faint
orange
hints
of
bubble
gum
some
biscuit
notes
and
then
it
dries
out
with
a
little
yeast
funk
and
an
assertive
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
to
conclude
with
a
crisp
dry
flavorful
finish
the
exquisitely
creamy
moussey
texture
gives
the
beer
a
satisfying
medium
to
medium

some

evident
wheat

aldo
in

with
some

tastes
just
like
the
nose
with
an
upfront
sweetness
that
finishes
dry
easy
drinking
and
somewhat
easy
bodied
nicely
done
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
beer
camp
mix
case
just
ok
starts
out
bitter
then
becomes
tropical
and
sweet
just
a
hint
of
coriander
not
bad
o
decent
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
too
much
coriander
which
somewhat
overpowers
the
other
elements
not
something
i
would
grab
on
even
a
semiregular
basis
o
a
nice
belgian
fine
with
our
spaghetti
dinner
the
nose
is
a
combination
of
perfume
floral
and
herbal
hops
caramel
malts
and
some
fruit
elements
the
hop
flavor
seems
more
prominent
with
a
floral
perfume
accent
the
coriander
is
obvious
in
a
spicy
fruity
tone
some
bitter
herbal
notes
longer
at
the
end
there
is
an
underpinning
of
caramel
malt
very
drinkable
very
approachable
beer
overall
a
very
centrist
version
of
the
style
solid
bpa
but
comes
off
a
bit
abrasive
at
times
with
the
spicy
yeast
and
added
coriander
combining
together
i
do
like
the
fruit
flavors
they
get
out
of
the
yeast
but
it
just
doesnt
come
together
as
a
whole
in
the
end
d
very
well
done
to
the
style
with
a
tip
towards
the
belgian
attributes
a
touch
sharp
at
times
making
this
far
from
my
favorite
bpa
however
everything
is
well
in
its
place
meaning
another
finely
crafted
and
enjoyable
camp
brew
with
great
balance
to
it
otoo
much
of
a
good
thing
can
be
a
bad
thing
the
dominating
spice
flavor
ruined
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
good
a
little
warming
and
full
feeling
on
the
tongue
then
dry
and
cleansing
with
lingering
spice
and
light
malt
flavors
overall
this
is
a
nice
cross
cultural
beer
not
quite
a
belgian
ipa
but
certainly
verging
on
it
very
drinkable
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
clear
foamy
white
head
good
head
retention
aroma
of
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of

flavor
in
the
taste
very
dry
aftertaste
medium
body
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
great
anf
overall
a
darn
good
beer
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
great
foaming
atop
it
i
enjoyed
the
hop
blend
they
used
for
this
beer
i
found
it
lightly
hopped
with
a
tropical
fruit
note
that
leads
into
a
honey
dewmelon
finish
it
tastes
pleasantly
topical
as
well
with
some
of
the
melon
and
honeydew
mixing
in
with
the
hop
profile
interestingly
i
found
a
touch
of
bicarbonate
on
the
finish
and
a
taste
of
malt
this
kept
my
interest
and
i
hope
to
try
it
again
taste
and
drinkability
very
refreshing
to
the
palate
light
crisp
a
good
summer
beer
very
heavy
with
banana
and
spice
tart
and
fruity
overall
not
bad
maybe
the
best
represented
beer
so
far
in
the
beer
camp
collab
thing
def
not
my
fav
style
but
represented
fairly
well
nice
mild

coriander
is
good
without
going
overboard
decent

of

from

unfortunately
because
i
usually

this

just
a
miss
for
me
3

crisp
from
start
to
finish
long
lasting
aftertaste
a
decent
brew
worthy
of
a
try
bottle
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
ale
with
a
quite
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
coriander
and
spicy
yeast
notes
are
dominant
with
light
notes
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
coriander
with
some
spicy
yeast
notes
with
some
light
belgian
malt
and
some
citrus
hops
body
is
slightly
under
average
for
the
style
with
good
carbonation
very
enjoyable
beer
but
hops
profile
was
not
as
evident
as
i
would
have
expected
this
is
really
good
i
like
it
another
nice
belgian
pale
ale
from
the
collection
great
yeast
profile
with
with
pale
ale
body
and
flavor
quite
nice
the
hop
presence
is
quite
large
here
in
flavor
bitterness
and
dryness
i
like
it
overall
solid
beer
overall
not
quite
as
good
as
id
expected
from
allagash
and
sierra
nevada
but
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
american
hops
and
belgian
beers
as
a
general
rule
that
being
said
this
is
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
it
manages
to
blend
the
character
of
both
styles
with
a
perfect
balance
well
done
overall
a
solid
offering
very
good
would
love
to
have
this
more
often
sensational
balance
unique
flavor
had
at
kings
head
in
portland
at
38
ibu
this
beer
had
me
wondering
where
its
flavor
profile
was
going
to
come
from
bam
there
it
was
this
brew
exemplified
its
collaboration
hops
from
sierra
nevada
and
the
wonderful
belgian
yeast
from
allagash
theres
a
wonderful
peppery
note
in
this
beer
that
makes
me
think
grilled
steak
or
salmon
i
didnt
drink
this
beer
out
of
glass
just
straight
out
of
the
bottle
so
no
notes
on
color
or
lace
etc
taste
is
a
soft
bubblegum
bpa
with
hints
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
nice
enough
bpa
but
nothing
earth
shattering
but
tasty
overall
what
you
would
expect
from
a
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
from
sierra
nevada
and
allagash
good
beer
o
kind
of
an
average
belgium
ale
nothing
particularly
unique
or
interesting
but
crisp
balanced
refreshing
and
just
wonderfully
brewed
this
is
a
weak
one
reminds
me
of
budweiser
no
thank
you
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
caronation
not
a
beer
im
a
fan
of
and
would
avoid
in
the
future
the
character
of
this
one
seems
quite
clashing
and
conflicting
o
i
would
have
liked
more
fruit
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
o
another
solid
camper
no
duds
from
my
perspective
yet
not
sure
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
brew
but
it
was
enjoyable
o
this
walk
just
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
kinda
meh
poured
a
nice
cloudy
golden
body
with
a
half
finger
of
white
head
quite
nice
looking
very
true
to
style
scents
of
lemon
zest
coriander
spicy
phenols
including
white
pepperlike
aromas
hints
of
tangy
orange
fruity
esters
reminiscent
of
apricot
a
faint
note
of
bubblegum
and
a
tiny
bit
of
clove
a
very
nice
aroma
that
is
fruity
and
spicy
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
should
be
and
is
quite
appetizing
flavor
begins
mediumdry
with
notes
of
white
pepper
coriander
lemon
zest
and
a
slight
pine
flavor
with
faint
tart
citrus
adding
depth
in
the
background
this
moves
into
more
pronounced
spicy
phenolic
flavors
focusing
on
white
pepper
and
coriander
with
lemon
zest
present
and
a
slightly
higher
bitterness
with
hints
of
tart
citrus
continuing
in
the
background
finish
is
mediumdry
with
notes
of
white
pepper
coriander
clove
spicy
belgian
yeast
phenols
that
are
less
determinable
and
lemon
zest
aftertaste
is
dry
with
notes
of
lemon
peel
clove
coriander
and
white
pepper
with
a
hint
of
crackerlike
malt
a
very
spicy
and
dry
flavor
profile
overall
not
completely
true
to
style
but
still
quite
pleasant
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
drying
with
moderate
carbonation
keeping
it
light
feeling
on
the
tongue
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
that
doesnt
stray
too
far
from
drier
examples
of
belgian
ales
in
aroma
and
flavor
its
refreshing
mouthfeel
also
make
this
quite
the
excellent
summer
beer
interestingly
it
reminds
me
most
of
drier
examples
of
saisons
overall
a
rather
decent
and
drier
belgian
pale
ale
a
nice
one
to
try
and
good
for
a
warm
summerspring
day
i
would
say
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
o
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
but
not
anything
different
from
what
so
many
other
breweries
including
allagash
have
done
better
still
a
good
summer
porch
rocker
hazy
dark
straw
color
lots
of
coriander
both
in
smell
and
taste
too
much
for
me
comes
across
as
very
dry
more
balancing
sweetness
to
cut
the
yeastiness
and
coriander
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
methinks
sierra
nevada
took
the
lead
for
this
collaberation
nice
copper
color
minimal
head
chantiily
lacing
but
barely
an
aroma
hints
of
grapefruit
that
wait
to
hit
the
palate
even
then
they
are
distant
mere
hints
nicely
done
i
aschew
hoppy
brews
so
this
was
a
nice
surprise
within
a
surprise
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
belgian
but
in
this
case
thats
not
so
bad
flavorful
and
holds
its
own
in
this
mix
pack
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
good
juicy
kick
of
hops
with
some
good
spice
and
wheat
overall
a
fine
beer
and
another
winner
in
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
hazy
straw

with
frothy
white

citrus
pine
fruity
aromas
light

coriander
belgian
spicy
peppery
flavors
i
truely
enjoyed
this
brew
pricey
but
real
good
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
presence
of
brett
without
the
flavoraroma
being
overpowering
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
and
recognizable
as
a
collaboration
with
allagash
whom
i
think
highly
of
o
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
its
got
some
nice
funk
going
on
as
well
though
the
bitterness
is
a
little
offputting
taste
is
light
and
somewhat
simple
with
pale
malt
yeast
and
coriander
comprising
the
main
source
of
its
flavors
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
dry
aftertaste
could
be
hop
derived
but
again
its
very
subtle
crisp
clean
and
effervescent
slight
phenolics
from
the
yeast
overall
it
was
quenching
with
no
flaws
and
paired
well
with
food
12oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
brownish
straw
color
with
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
funky
aroma
with
some
coriander
cloves
and
light
citrus
hops
the
taste
has
more
hops
than
the
aroma
indicated
citrus
with
some
light
tropical
fruit
notes
funky
yeast
coriander
and
cloves
as
well
finishes
with
some
citrus
peel
yeast
and
spices
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
this
was
better
than
i
expected
and
with
much
more
hops
overall
pretty
decent
beer
i
may
even
have
this
on
tap
since
it
is
the
allagash
collaboration
and
i
believe
it
has
been
making
the
rounds
here
in
new
england
o
its
very
very
very
ok
so
one
note
though
that
the
finished
product
comes
off
like
the
brewer
was
aware
of
the
standard
notes
a
belgian
pale
should
hit
e
g
slightly
fruity
dry
phenolic
yeasty
and
mailed
it
in
to
the
extent
that
every
note
is
aggressively
checked
but
none
of
them
are
very
wellintegrated
the
result
is
a
beer
that
fits
the
style
but
does
so
in
unimpressive
fashion
o
a
bit
muddled
between
wanting
to
be
hoppy
and
being
an
actual
belgian
beer
easy
enough
to
drink
but
a
bit
difficult
to
discern
where
this
was
actually
going
solid
but
a
weaker
part
of
the
12pack
o
not
really
digging
this
collaboration
much
way
too
bitter
and
all
the
flavor
is
derived
from
the
spicy
yeast
strain
the
body
was
fairly
typical
for
an
american
ipa
drinkability
was
ok
it
wasnt
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
others
folks
will
like
it
overall
good
for
what
it
is
and
often
find
that
hops
and
belgianstyle
yeasts
dont
play
well
together
ymmv
o
not
bad
overall
just
nothing
memorable
i
had
hoped
for
more
given
the
collaborating
breweries
ooverall
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
poured
hazy
light
amber
color
with
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
mild
yeasty
aroma
typical
of
belgian
brews
bready
with
slight
coriander
and
orange
peel
as
well
pungent
belgian
yeast
on
first
taste
hits
you
hard
slight
hoppy
finish
as
the
end
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
again
slight
coriander
and
orange
peel
with
the
taste
good
beer
would
enjoy
again
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
o
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
across
america
myrons
walk
45
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
and
solid
overall
i
will
say
that
as
you
drink
the
dryness
really
builds
and
becomes
the
dominant
factor
d
solid
appearance
and
aroma
give
way
to
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
in
terms
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
overall
a
bit
less
than
a
sum
of
its
parts
its
hard
to
believe
that
two
excellent
breweries
like
allagash
and
sierra
nevada
could
be
responsible
for
such
a
disappointing
brew
there
are
a
plethora
of
other
belgian
pale
ales
that
i
would
give
the
odd
to
before
recommending
this
one
taste
is
a
wonderful
and
refreshing
citrusfruitspice
collision
light
enough
to
session
yet
packed
with
a
metric
ton
of
flavor
yes
served
in
a
oversized
wine
glass
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
belgian
pale
the
bitterness
is
low
which
improves
drinkability
and
the
use
of
coriander
seems
to
play
surrogate
for
the
citrus
presence
that
you
will
often
get
from
hops
in
an
american
take
on
pale
ale
which
makes
the
fruitiness
softer
less
pungent
id
say
this
offering
sufficiently
meets
what
i
would
expect
from
a
collaboration
involving
americanbased
belgianstyle
heavyweights
allagash
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
overly
complex
and
surprisingly
easy
drinking
nice
general
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
i
really
love
the
elements
that
went
into
this
beer
myrons
walk
has
a
wonderful
citrus
and
piney
flavor
complemented
with
rich
belgian
yeast
that
offers
tones
of
spice
and
fruit
i
really
respect
how
well
balanced
this
beer
is
and
the
hoppy
notes
it
has
right
up
my
alley
o
id
prefer
a
toned
down
clove
and
coriander
profile
and
a
little
fuller
body
easy
drinking
but
forgettable
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
creamy
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
light
copper
with
gold
notes
the
beer
smell
has
some
strong
banana
yeast
notes
with
coriander
and
mint
notes
however
the
coriander
and
mint
notes
are
slightly
faint
the
beer
also
has
a
slight
metallic
smell
to
it
regarding
taste
the
beer
has
a
metallic
taste
to
it
the
belgian
yeast
is
noticeable
as
well
as
the
coriander
and
mint
notes
that
are
there
the
overall
flavor
that
comes
from
it
is
fairly
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
a
little
bit
watery
with
biting
carbonation
overall
an
okay
collaboration
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
my
second
beer
camp
beer
certainly
more
interesting
as
a
collaboration
than
the
torpedo
pils
still
waiting
for
my
first
blow
your
socks
off
beer
camp
beer
o
good
fusion
of
styles
appearance
is
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
has
the
coriander
and
other
herbs
i
thought
i
smelled
mint
the
taste
had
a
great
herb
beginning
and
end
while
having
light
belgian
wheat
and
mint
in
the
middle
thought
it
was
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
but
a
little
too
fizzy
for
my
taste
still
an
excellent
beer
tasty
enough
nicely
quenching
good
flavor
balance
bitterness
and
dry
finish
light
malt
and
quite
effervescent
the
body
though
is
decently
above
average
heres
a
definitive
sagelike
spice
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
short
but
bitter
again
not
much
belgian
to
this
beer
overall
its
good
but
a
bit
too
much
coriander
for
me
i
feel
like
it
somehow
overshadows
any
other
flavors
that
might
be
in
there
o
a
modest
belgian
pale
with
a
modest
bitterness
and
abv
easy
drinking
distinctly
belgian
o
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
the
bcaa
12pack
would
definitely
consider
buying
this
again
if
the
opportunity
were
offered
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
dose
of
brett
that
is
neither
too
strong
nor
too
overpowering
i
now
believe
this
to
be
my
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
12
pack
in
fact
i
wish
i
had
12
of
these
id
love
to
be
drinking
a
few
while
barbecuing
or
sitting
on
a
boat
this
brew
needs
to
be
made
again
and
again
for
summers
to
come
o
enjoyable
a
little
bit
more
from
the
malts
would
have
been
nice
but
the
mix
of
spices
in
here
works
well
together
and
doesnt
become
too
much
refreshing
and
tasty
an
interesting
beer
but
less
drinkable
than
anything
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
from
the
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
the
2014
beer

a
nice
mix
of
belgian
yeast
and
piney
hops
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
the
verdict
good
an
interesting
blend
of
a
yeasty
belgian
ale
and
an
ipa
but
ultimately
falls
short
of
most
of
the
other
beer
camp
offerings
quality
ingredients
but
the
combination
somehow
just
doesnt
excite
the
tongue
a
tasty
well
done
belgian
pale
ale
pleasant
balance
with
a
full
body
and
solid
malt
base
oa
solid
mixture
of
belgian
and
american
aspects
coming
from
two
us
breweries
that
i
respect
very
much
belgian
pale
ales
are
slowly
growing
on
me
overall
normally
belgian
pale
ales
are
not
my
favorite
beers
but
the
belgian
yeastiness
is
turned
way
down
on
this
one
the
hops
shine
through
and
make
this
very
interesting
and
flavorful
o
i
cant
believe
there
were
two
bpa
in
the
beer
camp
this
is
the
superior
one
sorry
rr
o
a
solid
bpa
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
part
of
the
beer
camp
compilation
collaboration
between
sierra
nevada
and
allagash
pours
a
nice
golden
with
minimal
head
classic
belgian
nose
yeasty
coriander
orange
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
at
the
end
smells
like
i
might
enjoy
this
one
taste
is
peppery
dry
yeasty
with
those
same
coriander
and
orange
flavors
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
but
not
unpleasant
i
actually
really
enjoy
this
beer
simple
flavors
well
made
pretty
tastey
for
the
genre
there
isnt
much
to
complain
about
but
also
not
much
to
stand
up
and
shout
about
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
ehh
ok
i
guess
but
not
he
best
balance
or
flavor
its
drinkable
but
nothing
id
want
again
it
lacks
a
solid
hop
backbone
that
could
work
a
lot
better
with
the
spices
thanks
allagash
and
sierra
nevada
though
overall
a
pretty
interesting
brew
but
doesnt
seem
to
hint
at
much
of
the
advertised
pineycitrus
and
fruity
spice
notes
as
advertised
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
really
different
unique
exciting
or
anything
new
brought
to
the
table
here
overall
im
a
bit
perplexed
by
this
beer
one
of
the
weakest
out
of
the
twelve
pack
and
ive
had
many
better
belgian
style
ales
from
both
breweries
i
dont
get
it
aroma
of
light
hops
and
some
belgian
yeast
character
which
shows
itself
not
so
much
in
strong
esters
but
in
an
earthy
pungent
and
bready
malt
character
aroma
gets
more
complex
with
warming
with
deep
muddled
aromas
taste
is
spritzy
with
carbonation
and
flavors
of
bread
lemon
and
spice
coriander
notes
increase
with
warming
and
blend
well
with
hopyeast
notes
finish
is
full
if
a
bit
uneventful
as
a
flash
of
citrus
exists
but
nothing
lingers
on
the
close
overall
pretty
good
and
quite
different
than
yvan
the
great
which
i
prefer
to
this
one
overall
a
solid
belgian
pale
i
like
the
hop
yeast
combo
overall
over
spiced
belgian
pale
not
well
balanced
i
was
hoping
for
more
in
light
of
everything
else
in
this
box
pours
out
a
clear
brass
with
thin
head
smells
of
spicy
belgian
yeast
lightly
toasty
and
bready
malts
and
resinous
hops
flavor
is
crisp
light
refreshing
reminding
me
of
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
blonde
beer
yeast
is
subdued
in
its
spiciness
the
coriander
doesnt
stand
up
well
against
the
strength
of
the
hops
definite
pnw
hops
profile
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
easygoing
the
carbonation
is
refreshing
very
solid
beer
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
dull
orange
hue
with
a
slight
haze
to
the
clarity
and
a
tight
quarter
inch
bright
white
head
nose
expresses
citrus
light
floral
aromas
and
a
hint
of
yeast
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
a
bit
of
spiciness
some
citrus
zest
and
a
light
earthyherbal
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
that
leaves
a
residual
bite
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
belgian
pale
ale
almost
comes
off
as
a
bpabipa
hybrid
sad
that
this
is
only
a
oneoff
o
eh
not
doing
it
for
me
overall
a
decent
well
crafted
beer
but
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
o
another
interesting
collaboration
brew
representing
a
meeting
of
the
minds
between
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
which
walks
the
tightrope
between
the
two
without
falling
off
i
dont
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
out
belgianstyle
pale
ales
but
id
be
glad
to
find
this
in
my
glass
again
faint
spicebased
astringency
and
warmth
surprisingly
low
carb
for
the
initial
pour
but
remains
at
least
medium
medium
body
and
just
a
bit
of
protein
creaminess
well
short
of
crisp
its
the
first
of
the
box
that
feels
more
the
other
brwer
than
sierra
nevada
its
not
a
bad
thing
but
the
allagash
belgian
yeast
dominates
my
7th
or
8th
selection
from
this
series
of
beer
camp
brews
everything
is
rating
close
to
a
4
ambitious
and
incredibly
fresh
pours
golden
in
hue
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
wonderful
floral
and
soapy
but
the
taste
pales
in
comparison
good
oily
mouthfeel
very
nice
beer
o
a
quaffable
and
harmonious
beer
all
flavors
play
well
the
coriander
starts
strong
initially
but
settles
in
step
with
the
rest
it
pops
and
has
some
charm
to
it
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
man
i
like
this
if
they
are
all
this
good
im
going
to
enjoy
exploring
this
pack
poured
ontap
at
a
beer
camp
tap
takeover
the
beer
was
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
frothy
clingy
bright
white
head
nose
of
subtle
coriander
nutmeg
and
basil
spice
with
a
grainy
and
subtle
hopped
backbone
flavors
are
spice
and
herb
forward
with
a
very
green
feel
throughout
subtle
yeast
funk
throughout
with
a
buttered
bread
backbone
light
and
smooth
with
a
spice
blend
and
herbal
aftertaste
the
finish
is
light
and
effervesced
flavorful
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
overall
not
bad
at
all
o
hoppy
for
style
overall
not
much
of
a
fan
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
id
never
drink
this
again
o
looked
and
smelled
good
but
didnt
come
through
disappointing
since
allagash
is
capable
of
delivering
one
of
these
interesting
combo
of
hop
and
yeast
profile
the
smoky
note
is
slightly
offputting
but
a
characterful
brew
pours
a
hazy
goldenyellow
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
earth
spice
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
earth
spice
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
lots
of
nice
earthy
aromas
and
flavors
overall
4
25
well
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
one
so
far
from
the
beer
camp
12pack
true
to
style
without
sacrificing
innovation
wellbuilt
and
extremely
balanced
and
generally
speaking
the
most
enjoyable
one
to
drink
so
far
this
is
and
the
russian
river
collab
are
what
i
want
to
drink
during
the
summer
pints
and
pints
of
it
this
would
also
be
a
great
candidate
for
some
light
wine
barrel
aging
too
ahem
sierra
nevada
and
allagash
cmon
guys
you
know
you
want
it
and
so
do
i
light
in
body
nicely
hopped
this
turned
out
to
be
an
excellent
early
morning
beer
o
very
good
representation
of
the
style
wouldt
expect
anything
less
from
these
two
great
breweries
a
good
start
on
this
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
journey
known
as
beer
camp
12
ounce
bottle
part
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12pack
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
that
stuck
around
a
little
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
but
light
the
brew
smells
like
pine
and
citrusy
grapefruit
hops
and
some
coriander
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
breadygrainy
malt
and
peppery
spice
luckily
the
flavors
arent
subtle
like
the
aroma
is
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
liked
this
brew
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
before
overall
number
3
out
of
the
pack
and
from
a
brewery
i
had
not
tried
before
and
not
really
had
heard
all
that
much
about
prior
to
trying
this
i
was
impressed
by
what
i
had
and
i
will
search
out
this
brewery
again
nice
golden
pour
with
a
light
foam
cap
my
second
beer
from
the
beer
camp
series
light
piney
mild
hop
taste
but
too
light
for
me
definitely
a
summer
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
on
a
sunny
afternoon
nice
aroma
nice
color
and
perfect
in
a
tulip
glass
very
excited
to
see
what
else
sierra
nevada
has
to
offer
in
this
one
time
only
package
light
tight
foam
over
a
pale
gold
beer
smells
of
faint
biscuit
and
hay
taste
is
light
grain
very
very
faint
banana
and
spice
which
may
be
coriander
but
i
dont
think
so
really
not
getting
much
from
this
beer
its
not
bad
but
where
is
the
flavor
its
got
a
lighter
body
with
fair
carbonation
there
is
a
sourish
after
taste
these
will
be
quick
and
to
the
point
reviews
as
i
have
12
to
write
o
fairly
nice
but
not
the
best
i
ever
had
nice
summer
beer
its
fastfleeting
finish
scrubs
the
thirst
from
the
palate
as
a
texture
and
minerally
taste
of
seltzer
water
allows
table
beer
belgianesque
character
to
assume
dry
in
finish
a
slight
tang
and
carbonic
bite
closes
the
taste
with
echoes
of
fruit
and
spice
hovering
above
wellcrafted
beer
as
id
expect
from
allagash
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
the
belgian
character
is
too
slight
o
i
know
a
lot
of
people
are
hating
on
the
beer
camp
stuff
and
i
really
think
the
12
pack
is
a
great
idea
even
if
the
beers
arent
all
rated
90
but
i
do
think
this
beer
is
very
sub
par
i
have
had
better
beers
from
brand
new
breweries
so
i
am
not
sure
how
sierra
nevada
decided
who
made
the
cut
to
be
in
this
this
was
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
from
the
12
pack
so
far
the
others
have
been
pretty
good
im
sick
of
hearing
people
say
how
big
of
a
let
down
beer
camp
has
been
and
that
its
overpriced
and
all
hype
and
all
of
that
well
i
disagree
sincerely
2ish
bucks
a
bottle
for
some
very
cool
stuff
relax
people
its
still
a
good
deal
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
box
so
far
a
belgian
golden
type
loaded
with
coriander
i
like
that
its
the
coriander
without
all
the
citrus
that
usually
goes
with
it
it
can
get
really
samey
all
the
time
these
type
of
beers
this
is
straw
colored
and
quite
clear
average
inch
of
white
head
on
top
the
nose
is
herbal
and
dry
like
a
dry
heating
of
spices
for
an
indian
dish
or
something
its
fragrant
from
the
coriander
and
a
little
from
the
yeast
too
ever
so
slightly
fruity
and
sweet
the
taste
is
way
cleaner
than
the
nose
super
easy
drinking
pale
honey
malt
base
a
little
heft
in
terms
of
body
and
a
middle
sweetness
thats
gone
by
the
finish
coriander
continuously
ramps
up
to
be
rather
prominent
in
the
finish
and
with
the
belgian
yeast
instead
of
the
usual
dried
orange
peel
i
think
its
a
nice
new
twist
on
a
familiar
style
critique
it
for
not
being
the
most
inventive
box
of
beers
fine
but
dont
critique
it
on
quality
because
they
have
all
been
fantastic
so
far
overall
this
is
a
satisfying
and
drinkable
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
quaff
this
all
day
overall
3
75
very
hoppy
belgian
goldenpale
ale
maybe
the
hoppiest
i
have
ever
had
la
chouff
puts
out
a
belgian
ipa
and
this
brew
reminds
me
very
much
of
that
beer
maybe
that
would
be
the
way
to
market
this
one
if
it
is
ever
brewed
again
belgian
ipa
good
beer
but
the
hops
take
it
way
outside
the
guidelines
for
the
style
overall
yeah
not
the
best
way
to
finish
off
the
mix
pack
i
understand
its
a
blonde
but
jeez
some
interesting
flavor
outside
the
yeast
notes
would
be
nice
so
yeah
the
beers
okay
in
a
dont
mind
drinking
it
kinda
way
but
dont
expect
much
of
anything
from
it
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
golden
orange
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
thick
lacing
aroma
of
orange
tangerine
grassy
and
citrus
hops
coriander
floral
and
estery
flavor
is
mixed
orange
and
lemon
citrus
light
saison
yeast
coriander
and
clove
belgian
yeast
citrus
hops
finishes
with
lemon
citrus
grapefruit
rind
and
citrus
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
good
peppery
carbonation
i
guess
if
i
had
to
guess
what
a
collaboration
between
allagash
and
sierra
nevada
would
taste
like
this
would
be
it
nice
belgian
yeast
and
spice
character
but
flavorful
hops
complementing
the
spicy
bitterness
an
aromatic
spicy
citrusy
ale
that
pushes
the
envelope
for
a
belgian
style
but
pulls
it
off
there
are
elements
of
american
pale
ale
tripel
and
belgian
pale
ale
in
here
and
they
play
well
together
tasty
i
felt
like
a
friend
had
left
me
abandonded
at
the
side
of
the
road
when
allagash
left
the
seattle
market
but
im
glad
to
have
a
small
taste
of
them
again
and
wish
them
luck
im
3
for
3
now
for
nice
ales
from
this
great
twelve
pack
this
is
a
nice
belgian
pale
mellow
light
and
easy
going
the
coriander
helps
to
give
it
a
saison
feel
serving
type
bottle
whats
doing
most
of
the
work
here
is
a
belgian
pale
base
that
is
more
than
content
responsibly
puttering
around
in
a
volkswagen
golf
with
the
windows
up
all
fuzzy
steering
wheel
cover
all
minding
speed
limits
meanwhile
the
hop
profile
is
putting
15s
on
its
88
supra
turbo
weaving
through
traffic
doing
burnouts
hella
road
rage
ultimately
not
bad
just
too
piercingly
unbalanced
to
coalesce
into
anything
noteworthy
o
this
is
fantastic
a
quintessential
belgian
pale
ale
in
my
eyes
i
guess
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
the
brains
behind
allagash
this
is
a
great
summertime
brew
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
if
it
came
in
any
other
variety
than
singles
overall
very
solid
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
going
on
very
good
brew
but
i
wonder
why
this
is
a
collaboration
between
two
world
class
brewers
slightly
hazy
golden
pour
with
a
onefinger
white
head
mild
citrus
aroma
taste
is
very
bready
with
flavors
of
biscuit
spice
and
yeast
dominating
medium
bodied
with
a
good
citrus
flavor
that
comes
through
in
the
middle
and
finishes
with
a
nice
resinous
bitterness
the
taste
consolidates
breaed
toasted
biscuit
citrus
and
spice
into
a
wellbalance
experience
and
then
catches
me
unawares
with
the
clean
crisp
finish
1
down
and
11
to
go
was
expecting
some
greater
variation
on
the
style
but
didnt
really
get
it
some
complexity
with
the
spice
notes
but
nothing
overwhelming
thats
good
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
nice
bpa
it
had
a
lot
more
flavors
than
most
of
the
american
ones
out
there
maybe
a
touch
too
dry
yes
raul
wouldnt
mind
having
another
pours
a
mix
of
straw
yellow
and
light
amber
accents
topped
with
a
fluffy
clean
white
two
finger
head
excellent
retention
thick
coating
lacing
light
citrus
belgian
yeast
coriander
and
clove
on
the
nose
opens
with

and

yeast

with

citrus
rind
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
of
pine
light
body
smooth
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
moderate
carbonation
really
excellent
brew
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
in
this
years
beer
camp
pack
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
then
most
in
the
box
o
a
well
made
belgian
ipa
nothing
overly
exciting
but
still
a
well
made
beer
overall
pretty
much
just
an
above
average
beer
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
im
sure
some
fans
of
belgian
beers
will
appreciate
it
its
just
not
the
type
of
belgian
that
i
like
i
would
still
give
it
a
shot
though
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
event
at

pours
a
hazy
golden
lazy
carbonation
nice
yeasty
sourdough
coriander
thick
creamy
body
with
small
silky
head
sharp
hops
bite
on
the
finish
a
true
belgian
spot
on
for
the
style
the
best
of
the
lot
so
far
im
happy
with
this
beer
i
think
others
were
expecting
the
next
white
whale
while
i
simply
wanted
a
good
beer
for
me
its
mission
accomplished
o
a
solid
beligian
ipa
clean
and
easy
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
a
nice
spiciness
to
this
beer
you
can
taste
belgian
yeast
a
very
good
and
slight
citrus
taste
but
huge
banana
notes
in
this
belgian
style
it
was
fruity
and
bready
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
in
the
pack
i
have
8
more
to
go
but
this
may
hold
as
the
third
best
38
ibu
exceptionally
brewed
wonderful
beer
i
would
drink
this
quite
a
bit
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
definitely
worth
trying
5
00
a
penchant
for
yeast
eh
there
was
such
a
pile
of
lees
atop
the
kick
that
i
was
unsure
as
to
how
to
proceed
following
the
popping
of
the
cap
gentle
mais
oui
certainment
but
even
at
that
like
the
lemon
zestiness
of
the
hops
was
in
counterbalance
with
the
sweet
fruitiness
of
the
yeasts
esters
this
was
an
experiment
which
needs
tweaking

is
present
its
not
nearly
as
strong
as
the
aroma
mild
sweetness
bubblegum
lemon
citrus
and
some
yeasty
esters
lighter
body
actually
a
bit
thin
overall
quit
nice
m
somewhat
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
thickness
but
smooth
and
even
slightly
creamy
in
feel
nonetheless
because
of
the
wellcalibrated
carbonation
levels
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
with
a
mixture
of
different
flavors
that
fell
into
place
very
well
not
the
best
belgian
ale
ive
tried
but
this
one
is
definitely
up
there
pours
a
hazy
pale
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
orange
citrus
coriander
and
a
nice
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
coriander
orange
juice
citrus
a
small
alcohol
note
and
somewhat
peppery
a
smooth
and
a
medium
bodied
moouthfeel
with
a
dry
spice
with
a
small
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
boozy
and
peppery
and
somewhat
all
over
the
place
in
the
taste
a
nice
americanstyle
belgian
and
at
7
20
abv
is
a
good
option
if
you
want
a
lighter
beer
but
with
significant
punch
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
yeast
spice
taste
is
bursting
with
flavor
lots
of
spice
some
fruits
yeast
very
flavorful
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
top
notch
beer
worth
seeking
out
the
cpj
bottle
from
oreillys
orange
tinged
body
with
a
token
head
and
a
few
drops
only
of
lace
are
later
left
yeast
with
some
fruit
and
spice
aroma
above
average
mouthfeel
but
also
aggressively
carbonated
good
drinkability
corriander
and
pepper
and
secondary
fruit
and
tanginess
decent
take
on
the
style
o
an
interesting
belgian
pale
ale
with
heavy
witbier
spicing
cutting
back
on
the
spicing
would
help
this
one
out
but
it
is
still
pretty
enjoyable
overall
this
tastes
to
me
like
a
strong
saison
i
know
the
whole
point
of
this
beer
is
that
it
really
fits
no
specific
category
but
thats
the
flavor
profile
id
compare
this
beer
to
the
spice
flavor
is
dominant
a
result
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
extra
hops
not
at
all
a
bitter
beer
though
lots
of
different
flavors
blend
together
in
this
beer
this
ale
pours
fairly
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
burst
of
fruity
esters
a
lot
of
banana
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
hints
of
clove
inviting
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
fruity
esters
a
lot
like
banana
bread
with
some
cloves
and
tropical
fruits
these
flavors
are
balanced
out
by
some
spicy
hop
flavor
and
moderatelow
hop
bitterness
the
beer
finishes
slightly
dry
with
just
a
bit
of
lingering
yeast
character
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
mediumfull
overall
a
nicely
made
beer
refreshing
yet
still
interesting
worth
a
try
totally
unique
flavor
i
dont
know
if
this
would
get
tiresome
but
its
a
cute
new
playmate
they
brew
i
made
needed
less
coriander
less
wheat
and
more
citrus
when
i
add
a
squeeze
of
lemon
it
is
better
this
beer
has
the
detergent
like
perfume
odor
and
taste
too
just
not
for
me
i
guess
not
great
but
worthy
of
a
try
possibly
needs
to
be
cold
cellared
to
improve
it
a
bit
it
is
tough
to
compare
american
belgians
against
the
likes
of
westmalle
and
chimay
this
beer
has
a
pretty
cool
name
makes
me
think
of
the
one
line
from
the
bloodhound
gang
song
youre
pretty
when
im
drunk
but
anyway
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
has
an
average
belgian
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
decent
bitterness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
the
overall
on
this
beer
is
that
its
an
average
beer
but
not
something
id
rave
about
overall
very
nice
complex
and
refreshing
something
not
a
typical
belgian
at
all
as
it
resembles
a
hefeweizen
more
than
the
claimed
base
witbier
regardless
it
is
delicious
and
perfect
when
a
stronger
summer
seasonal
is
desired
o
a
very
complex
and
tasty
belgian
pale
ale
very
refreshing
and
perfect
for
the
summer
heat
and
humidity
pours
a
bright
peach
color
with
a
really
nice
twofinger
white
head
good
lacing
as
it
goes
down
and
a
thin
collar
stays
along
for
the
ride
the
nose
brings
some
light
bready
malt
as
well
as
a
light
floral
aroma
and
a
bit
of
earth
and
spice
flavor
has
mild
malt
sweetness
plus
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
yeast
kicks
in
with
some
mild
spice
toward
the
finish
really
light
yet
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
the
highlight
of
the
beer
for
me
nicely
done
thanks
again
andy
goodthe
aroma
is
awesome
and
the
alcohol
is
expertly
hidden
however
the
flavor
tastes
like
theres
just
a
little
too
much
going
on
the
belgian
yeast
along
with
the
highish
hop
rates
makes
the
flavor
a
little
muddy
still
very
drinkable
and
pretty
solid
but
not
spot
on
pours
a
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
quickly
receding
white
head
spicy
aroma
with
light
fruits
banana
bread
taste
with
some
citrus
coming
through
yeasty
and
some
dry
spice
medium
body
and
moderately
drinkable
i
need
to
revisit
this
one
drinkability
is
okay
its
a
clean
brew
the
abv
is
well
disguised
but
the
esters
are
unapologetic
im
a
big
fan
of
bavarian
esters
but
theyre
not
for
everyone
ointeresting
in
that
it
tastes
like
a
hefeweisse
meets
a
belgian
pale
aleworth
a
tastea
decent
beer
from
furthermore
this
to
me
is
a
summer
beer
its
abv
is
too
high
for
it
to
be
a
session
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
in
the
least
worthy
of
a
six
pack
purchase
not
my
go
to
brew
but
a
descent
change
of
pace
d
very
nice
wi
version
of
a
belgian
style
i
could
have
more
than
a
few
the
7
2
abv
is
very
well
hidden
excellent
summer
brew
and
worth
checking
out
pours
a
hazy
orange
red
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
banana
coriander
wheat
and
some
citrus
tastes
of
banana
wheat
orange
and
some
spices
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
brownish
gold
in
color
and
cloudy
large
but
inactive
prickle
bubbles
and
small
active
ones
light
rim
of
foam
and
some
lacing
banana
dominant
nose
with
just
a
whiff
of
wheat
smooth
sweet
attack
that
is
consistent
with
the
nose
some
pleasant
banana
tones
imparted
by
the
yeast
nice
wheat
flavors
just
about
right
the
hops
comes
on
strong
towards
the
finish
and
leaves
little
burn
in
the
aftertaste
the
alcohol
helps
to
enhance
pretty
decent
as
far
as
summer
beers
fo
some
mild
sour
notes
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
a
belgian
style
ale
it
drinks
closer
to
those
than
some
of
the
usual
belgian
style
ales
that
come
more
like
lagers
or
weak
ales
than
anything
else
low
abvs
well
relatively
keep
this
drinkable
though
some
may
find
it
too
carbonated
d
really
good
kept
going
back
for
more
was
not
sure
of
the
abv
not
marked
on
bottle
and
did
feel
the
7
after
a
while
but
didnt
taste
it
d
ehh
its
ok
but
really
i
just
wanted
to
try
it
since
it
was
the
only
new
beer
on
my
shelf
at
my
local
sixer
place
i
wasnt
in
love
with
it
but
it
was
pretty
drinkable
for
a
belgium
wish
this
was
in
the
variety
case
rather
than
that
crappy
make
weight
d
a
good
belgain
from
the
states
a
tad
stronger
even
for
the
style
but
its
smoothness
helps
nice
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
but
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
id
have
it
again
but
given
the
variety
of
bpas
out
there
id
try
something
different
da
little
messy
and
has
some
flaws
overall
it
isnt
band
the
phenol
flavor
lingers
for
me
a
bit
too
long
but
the
bitterness
balance
to
the
fruit
and
floral
esters
is
quite
interesting
appears
a
clouded
golden
orange
apricot
tone
with
a
large
white
head
lacing
is
fine
and
intricate
aroma
has
a
mix
of
citruscloveanise
and
american
hops
also
some
tropical
fruits
mangopineapple
character
going
on
in
there
flavor
blends
a
heavily
spiced
wit
with
a
big
belgian
golden
ale
over
ripened
banana
and
pineapple
juice
with
bitter
citrus
pith
accented
hops
an
heavy
with
coriander
and
a
touch
of
anise
pretty
intense
experience
i
can
feel
and
taste
the
booze
i
would
guess
even
a
bit
higher
than
the
seven
percent
it
actually
is
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
cloying
at
times
between
the
layers
of
spices
that
stick
to
the
palate
between
sips
and
the
aggressive
hop
profile
its
just
a
bit
sticky
on
the
palate
with
some
residual
sugars
carbonation
is
ample
no
complaints
on
that
but
those
spices
make
me
want
to
brush
my
teeth
drinkability
overall
is
decent
a
strong
aggressive
interesting
hybrid
ale
another
uniquely
american
take
on
a
classic
style
gotta
love
our
no
rules
attitude
when
it
comes
to
brewing
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
golden
color
that
is
darker
on
top
and
lighter
on
the
bottom
with
a
one
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
with
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
present
the
aroma
is
of
a
bubble
gum
smell
with
hints
of
lemon
corriander
and
a
floral
hop
the
taste
has
a
big
rich
bubblegum
like
flavor
rounded
out
by
floral
hops
with
hints
of
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
low
to
moderate
carbonation
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
good
its
an
inviting
aroma
with
a
big
smooth
flavor
that
keeps
you
coming
back
overall
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
seemed
much
more
balanced
for
now
this
is
my
review
if
i
find
it
again
on
tap
i
will
have
to
revise
my
scores
if
i
see
fit
pours
a
slightly
hazed
gold
color
with
highly
active
carbonation
leaving
a
big
cap
of
soapy
whit
ehead
decent
retention
scent
is
a
huge
whiff
of
peppery
belgian
yeasts
and
spices
such
as
corriander
a
light
citrus
and
wheaty
background
round
out
the
nice
scent
the
first
sip
is
an
almost
cloying
bite
of
the
corriander
and
peppery
yeast
the
malts
come
across
as
quite
sweet
almost
bubblegum
like
for
containing
such
a
large
portion
of
wheat
and
a
muddled
citrus
flavor
is
present
throughout
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
dry
finnish
and
a
touch
of
burn
an
interesting
beer
that
tends
to
overdo
some
of
its
ingredients
d
very
quaffable
almost
too
easy
to
drink
at
7
2
havent
heard
much
about
this
brewery
but
picked
up
this
single
while
up
north
last
month
i
will
certianlly
make
sure
i
get
more
of
this
gem
im
pretty
sure
furthermore
brewing
just
moved
into
the
pittsburgh
area
as
i
just
started
seeing
their
beers
pop
up
around
town
fatty
boombalatty
was
a
nice
introduction
to
the
brewery
for
me
as
it
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
also
or
furthermore
it
looks
like
the
pricing
for
their
beers
are
great
as
a
case
of
this
beer
was
right
around
35
when
i
spotted
it
at
the
beer
distributor
d
this
brew
packs
an
unexpected
punch
of
goodness
i
heard
good
things
but
didnt
expect
this
very
nicely
done
and
deliciously
drinkable
i
may
have
to
pick
up
some
more
fatty
drinkability
an
average
american
belgian
style
ale
worth
the
try
i
dont
mind
coriander
but
it
dominated
this
for
me
for
once
i
feel
like
a
beer
could
be
a
bit
more
diluted
as
this
was
sticky
sweet
coriander
d
quite
flavorful
and
complex
as
a
belgian
should
be
alcohol
level
is
middle
of
the
road
at
7
2
not
very
detectable
at
all
in
the
flavor
but
im
feeling
it
a
bit
2nd
beer
of
the
night
not
my
favorite
belgian
pale
but
a
pretty
good
example
and
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
try
this
one
maybe
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
all
of
beer
d
unique
and
delicious
ive
tried
2
from
these
guys
now
and
really
liked
both
this
one
in
particular
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
yeast
notes
corinander
bready
with
some
slight
pepper
notes
the
taste
is
slighlty
sweet
yeasty
with
a
nice
malt
note
bready
corinander
and
some
pepper
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
bpa
d
goes
down
nicely
but
forces
you
to
take
your
time
dnice
beer
seems
to
not
know
what
it
wants
to
be
esters
are
a
bit
high
and
the
beer
could
be
drier
but
it
still
tastes
nice
its
a
cross
between
a
hefe
an
ipa
and
a
belgian
pale
and
its
definitely
drinkable
though
probably
lacking
the
heft
to
be
a
serious
belgian
pale
pours
a
hazy
very
cloudy
orange
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
very
very
lite
carbonation
it
had
much
of
a
citrus
type
very
spicey
feel
to
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
spring
houses
robot
bastard
ipa
very
delicious
beer
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
and
enjoyed
a
lot
from
begining
to
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
was
a
pretty
nice
flavored
and
easy
drinking
beer
not
what
i
expected
for
something
listed
as
belgian
pale
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
d
a
good
pale
but
wit
characteristics
in
the
spice
profile
make
it
interesting
it
is
hard
to
rate
to
one
style
but
the
citric
zing
and
high
carbonation
leans
toward
double
wit
w
a
peppery
end
it
drinks
very
well
for
either
style
though
and
for
its
abv
boombalatty
has
a
apricot
orange
color
and
a
weak
head
that
reached
an
inch
before
lowering
into
nothing
no
lace
from
this
one
this
pretty
much
smells
like
orange
jolly
ranchers
mixed
with
some
fruity
yeast
tastes
of
oranges
apricots
and
some
cereal
like
tastes
hops
are
not
really
in
the
picture
the
feel
is
between
light
and
medium
with
some
carb
nothing
to
exciting
goes
down
smooth
but
kinda
dead
i
could
see
going
for
one
of
these
in
the
summer
but
would
not
seek
it
out
on
the
regular
d
its
was
allright
not
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
but
pretty
solid
really
improved
as
it
warmed
up
i
like
the
effort
here
from
furthermore
with
a
belgian
pale
ale
that
packs
a
lot
of
power
and
flavor
into
a
rather
steady
sipping
package
im
glad
i
picked
a
bottle
of
this
up
d
very
tasty
though
so
close
to
new
glarus
crackd
wheat
in
the
same
market
that
id
buy
ngcw
instead
the
main
difference
is
fbfb
has
more
bananaarugula
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
spice
anise
and
leather
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
more
anise
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
this
one
goes
down
easy
but
the
upfront
and
lingering
sweetness
make
it
a
special
once
in
a
while
treat
i
like
they
beer
they
made
i
want
more
with
something
lightly
spicy
rabbit
braised
with
mustard
or
some
curried
leg
of
lamb
very
high
carbonation
slightly
aggressive
on
the
palate
but
it
gets
better
as
some
co2
escapes
from
the
beer
murky
golden
pour
with
a
nice
head
that
recedes
down
to
a
collar
smell
is
clove
up
front
but
with
a
little
swirling
to
breathe
an
awesome
bouquet
of
citrus
and
spices
comes
to
the
forefront
taste
is
a
bit
more
watery
that
i
would
hope
based
on
the
nose
but
is
still
pretty
smooth
and
satisfying
mostly
light
bready
malts
and
faint
hints
of
spices
medium
bodied
with
a
tiny
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
this
one
is
decent
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
i
knew
going
into
this
that
this
was
the
brewerys
most
popular
beer
in
my
mind
it
didnt
disappoint
i
liked
this
a
lot
great
two
finger
head
thtat
recedes
to
a
nice
super
thick
foam
which
leaves
a
soft
lacing
lets
not
forget
the
eruption
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
this
frothmonster
amdist
a
hazey
sunshine
amber
the
aroma
has
some
spicey
white
peppery
hop
notes
with
candi
sugar
and
some
yeasty
and
wheat
banana
fruits
the
taste
starts
with
hot
bananas
that
7
2
abv
giving
the
bananas
that
hot
twang
the
middle
is
a
little
more
mellow
but
the
heat
still
lingers
with
the
fruity
yeast
and
sugary
malt
the
finish
i
warm
sweet
and
a
little
metallic
but
still
good
d
i
love
this
beer
a
lot
and
that
is
why
it
saddens
me
that
it
is
only
seasonal
and
will
be
disappearing
soon
it
has
a
high
abv
but
you
cannot
even
notice
it
and
that
is
what
makes
this
such
a
dangerously
drinkable
belgian
as
they
say
this
a
more
of
a
belgian
strong
palewit
hybrid
than
a
stand
alone
strong
pale
drinkability
is
great
just
enough
hops
to
compliment
the
base
beer
and
keep
it
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sit
out
on
the
patio
and
drink
all
afternoon
d
pretty
good
beer
overall
considering
the
amount
of
alcohol
which
went
undetected
by
me
however
the
ingredients
of
wheat
coriander
banana
and
hops
could
be
better
balanced
by
a
more
subtle
carbonation
level
to
bring
out
some
of
these
characteristics
better
aside
from
that
i
could
have
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
single
scooped
from
rileys
in
madison
and
foamed
back
to
nova
d
good
because
it
would
be
something
that
i
could
drink
regulary
but
would
not
be
the
first
thing
i
would
reach
for
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
nice
mix
of
yellow
and
orange
and
i
cant
tell
if
its
chill
haze
or
just
haze
but
i
think
its
a
bit
of
yeast
haze
because
it
didnt
really
clear
up
throughout
the
drink
but
i
can
still
see
through
the
beer
the
head
is
thin
and
white
not
very
dense
but
it
actually
stays
around
a
bit
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
kind
of
normal
for
the
belgian
pale
style
the
smell
has
a
few
dominant
characteristics
all
of
which
are
interesting
first
theres
a
kind
of
fruity
sugary
bubble
gum
flavor
partially
from
nice
fruity
esters
and
partially
from
the
candy
sugar
i
assume
that
gets
used
in
this
one
but
its
really
powerful
in
the
nose
at
first
that
subsides
to
a
deep
spiciness
i
mean
really
spicy
earthy
and
pungent
herbal
kind
of
leafy
almost
like
burning
leaves
with
a
hint
of
grass
clippings
you
can
really
smell
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
not
quite
bready
but
sweet
mixed
in
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
tartness
the
taste
starts
out
like
chewing
on
fruity
gum
thanks
to
some
esters
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
that
falls
back
quickly
into
this
sticky
earthy
taste
the
malt
comes
in
a
bit
toasty
and
crackery
but
theres
this
uncontrollable
earthy
spiciness
in
there
its
just
herbal
leafy
and
almost
burnt
with
the
hops
and
the
spicy
yeast
combining
the
yeast
is
actully
a
bit
tart
as
well
as
spicy
somewhere
between
saison
yeast
and
belgian
pale
yeast
the
malt
presence
comes
in
at
different
intervals
like
cookies
and
also
a
bit
like
powdery
starchy
grains
in
different
places
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
burnt
sugar
type
taste
to
it
overall
its
really
a
great
belgian
pale
perhaps
leaning
the
furthest
towards
that
earthy
spiciness
of
any
ive
ever
had
the
body
is
actually
very
sticky
and
full
from
the
malt
and
hops
combining
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
lively
crisp
and
accented
by
the
moderate
dryness
of
the
beer
the
only
thing
is
that
the
earthiness
can
wear
on
you
thanks
to
that
dryness
but
i
really
find
myself
enjoying
it
not
the
easiest
to
drink
its
actually
a
bit
challenging
though
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
but
could
not
make
it
a
beer
i
drink
often
despite
how
much
i
enjoy
it
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
pours
a
super
cloudy
and
chunky
orangeyellow
like
yogourt
thick
white
head
forms
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
some
lace
chunks
smell
is
neat
lots
of
banana
and
orange
peel
some
floral
wheat
yeasty
very
fruity
pineapple
touch
of
apple
cider
sweetness
very
neat
taste
is
nice
too
orange
sharp
and
citric
yeasty
lots
of
light
fruit
toasted
wheat
banana
and
spice
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
cool
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
mouthfeel
medium
to
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
for
the
abv
not
sure
what
style
this
is
almost
like
a
weizenbockpale
ale
hybrid
or
something
weird
but
very
enjoyable
pretty
good
drinkability
the
higher
carbonation
gives
a
fuller
feeling
when
drinking
this
for
me
two
of
these
would
be
about
the
max
for
myself
drinkability
is
good
basically
a
fusion
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
a
hefeweizen
not
bad
though
drinkability
is
a
quandry
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
with
just
a
bit
less
yeast
i
think
itd
be
a
solid
4
5
but
the
yeast
is
just
a
bit
over
the
top
both
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
pull
that
back
let
the
hops
really
shine
and
this
is
a
well
above
average
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
us
belgian
beer
kind
of
an
amped
up
hefeweizen
flavor
and
feel
had
an
interesting
mix
of
spice
flavors
and
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
balanced
worth
a
try
drinkability
since
this
was
one
of
the
free
beer
options
at
the
wedding
reception
i
was
at
the
other
was
coors
light
on
tap
no
thanks
i
did
a
nice
session
with
several
of
these
and
liked
them
quite
a
bit
will
look
for
this
one
again
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
a
deep
golden
orange
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
fruity
esters
medium
bodied
with
sweet
malt
and
citrus
flavors
up
front
but
then
finished
with
a
strong
warming
alcohol
flavor
not
really
the
most
pleasant
finish
for
a
beer
in
my
opinion
i
might
give
this
another
try
in
the
future
d
if
the
abv
is
really
over
7
furthermore
did
a
world
class
job
of
hiding
it
it
could
sneak
up
on
you
if
you
had
a
bunch
in
a
single
night
definitely
interesting
check
it
out
d
filling
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
this
beer
is
unique
compared
to
others
ive
had
i
can
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
more
of
these
a
solid
beer
for
sure
i
would
place
it
at
the
top
of
my
best
of
summer
seasonal
list
this
is
a
brightyellow
colored
beer
with
a
modest
head
on
it
the
aroma
is
fairly
nice
fruity
with
a
nice
perfumy
scent
very
nice
flavor
hugely
coriander
with
a
bitter
citrusiness
somewhat
similar
to
celis
grand
cruall
the
flavors
of
wit
but
stronger
with
a
good
tart
phenolic
edge
pours
a
nice
sunset
yellow
color
with
a
huge
belgian
head
that
dissipates
just
right
and
leaves
great
lacing
and
a
nice
ring
the
smell
is
fruit
full
its
a
blast
of
apples
pears
and
peaches
followed
by
the
mandatory
clove
its
fantastic
cant
wait
to
drink
it
the
taste
is
all
summertime
sit
on
the
back
porch
take
it
easy
its
all
fruit
up
front
then
some
hops
and
wheat
and
nice
sour
yeast
with
a
clove
finish
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
this
beer
is
fantastic
highly
recommended
this
is
summertime
overall
i
feel
like
next
to
maybe
one
other
americanmade
belgian
style
this
is
the
absolute
best
ive
had
seriously
this
beer
is
extremely
complex
superbly
balanced
between
sweet
and
spicy
the
carbonation
is
perfect
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
id
say
it
is
almost
every
bit
as
good
as
duvel
im
not
afraid
to
go
against
convention
when
it
is
warranted
and
for
sure
it
is
in
this
case
as
soon
as
im
done
with
the
6pack
i
know
i
will
want
more
d
an
ok
belgian
definitely
better
ones
out
there
this
is
a
very
strange
brew
but
i
made
peace
with
that
and
decided
that
i
love
it
appearance
is
well
clearly
unfiltered
color
of
banana
runts
smell
is
nice
like
pineapple
with
a
touch
of
hops
taste
really
opens
this
one
up
lots
of
different
citrus
fruit
esters
some
floral
hops
on
the
back
and
may
be
a
hnt
of
beligan
candy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
out
of
this
world
good
drinks
easy
but
very
thick
and
unfiltered
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
fantastic
surprise
i
like
it
a
lot
very
drinkable
very
tasty
just
very
good
across
the
board
i
dont
know
that
this
fits
perfectly
into
any
style
guideline
but
its
really
tasty
i
actually
was
searching
for
reasons
not
to
rate
it
so
highly
but
i
could
not
find
them
this
is
one
id
love
to
have
in
my
fridge
with
regularity
this
is
almost
certainly
a
beer
that
is
best
consumed
fresh
once
those
hops
begin
to
fade
the
yin
and
the
yang
will
suffer
a
bit
after
all
yin
without
yang
isnt
nearly
as
good
fatty
boombalatty
is
da
bomb
and
furthermore
is
an
underappreciated
gem
this
was
one
tasty
beer
lots
of
complexity
to
the
taste
with
fruit
yeast
wheat
and
a
nice
amount
of
bitter
to
balance
things
quite
nicely
it
sure
is
unfiltered
its
a
thick
peach
color
with
a
good
head
good
mouthfeel
and
medium
plus
carbonation
worth
looking
for
this
brew
really
quite
nice
effort
here
could
keep
some
around
if
it
was
available
in
il
thanks
to
mr
quartetman
for
this
one
for
an
american
brewery
that
doesnt
necessarily
speciallize
in
belgian
beer
not
bad
at
all
d
it
is
a
little
bit
sweet
for
a
session
beer
but
it
really
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
it
has
a
lot
going
on
for
the
style
and
a
great
attempt
by
an
american
brewery
to
brew
a
belgian
style
ale
overall
i
feel
like
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
belgian
style
ale
it
might
be
a
tad
high
in
alcohol
because
its
not
hidden
terribly
well
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
it
but
its
just
a
solid
effort
i
would
have
it
again
light
to
medium
bodied
fairly
carbonated
which
actually
gives
it
a
refreshing
quality
although
truthfully
it
tasted
better
as
the
beer
warmed
and
the
carbonation
died
down
a
bit
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
but
after
a
few
of
these
you
would
certainly
feel
it
this
is
something
id
like
to
drink
again
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
from
furthermore
d
i
liked
this
enough
to
have
3
or
4
per
sitting
i
enjoyed
it
wuite
a
bit
d
all
the
time
brew
really
love
it
as
it
feels
light
like
a
15
a
case
beer
but
gets
you
messed
and
tastes
like
a
crafty
goodie
snack
snack
snack
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
night
cap
not
sure
id
session
it
definitely
not
at
the
abv
balance
schmalance
call
it
a
train
wreck
if
you
want
but
i
totally
dug
the
complexity
and
lack
of
overwhelming
sweetness
ive
experienced
with
other
belgians
actually
nothing
overwhelmed
anything
else
so
id
have
to
say
there
is
a
nice
balance
here
in
a
rather
chaotic
way
hmmm
i
think
i
might
be
starting
to
get
this
whole
belgian
thing
crisp
taste
hops
evident
lemongrass
chamomile
finishes
dry
burst
of
lemony
hop
flavor
which
is
nice
with
the
spice
taste
good
malty
backend
big
mouthfeel
of
spice
hops
lingering
chamomile
and
malty
goodness
it
was
a
nice
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
a
read
of
the
beers
description
at
their
official
site
explains
the
complex
tastes
good
beer
that
started
out
better
than
it
ended
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
on
this
one
a
bit
of
candied
sugar
some
caramel
and
a
little
yeastiness
taste
is
on
cue
with
the
aroma
candy
sugar
a
bit
of
apple
slightly
spicey
and
a
dry
yeasty
finish
a
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
carbonation
was
ample
enough
and
overall
pleasant
to
drink
a
decent
take
on
the
style
d
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
amongst
the
belgian
spices
but
that
is
not
enough
to
salvage
a
spotty
flavor
this
beer
very
yeastdriven
in
that
most
of
the
character
is
spun
off
the
fermentation
not
the
grains
and
hops
in
addition
to
the
bubblegum
are
more
spicy
phenols
plus
red
apple
and
white
grape
esters
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
gold
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
with
a
short
white
head
the
body
is
also
deceptively
drinkable
for
a
7
beer
all
things
considered
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
kudos
to
furthermore
this
stuff
isnt
easy
this
is
good
i
just
dont
know
what
it
is
with
the
high
abv
it
might
be
hard
to
have
several
in
a
row
but
it
would
certainly
be
tempting
a
real
good
ale
i
would
of
liked
the
lemon
cut
back
a
little
to
bring
the
other
flavors
out
but
it
is
still
very
flavorful
the
high
abv
cuts
down
on
drinkability
overall
i
though
this
was
excellent
a
style
that
is
hard
to
master
but
they
proved
they
could
do
a
damn
good
job
at
it
a
classic
in
my
book
and
i
am
very
glad
that
i
chose
to
seek
this
one
out
definitly
a
winner
and
i
loved
every
minute
of
it
nice
cloudy
orange
color
an
finger
of
lacy
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
really
liked
the
taste
more
like
a
wheat
ale
on
steroids
like
if
blue
moon
had
a
bigger
stronger
hoppier
brother
good
aftertaste
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
dangerously
drinkable
highly
reccomend
and
will
pick
up
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
chewy
a
little
thicker
than
i
was
planning
on
and
it
also
has
a
nice
carb
to
it
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
the
sweetness
might
get
to
me
after
that
but
overall
a
good
beer
d
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
with
nothing
to
exciting
about
it
the
hops
dont
seem
to
fit
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
flavors
and
the
dry
malt
flavor
makes
it
a
bit
bland
d
pretty
solid
and
its
pretty
cheap
not
a
bad
option
for
a
belgian
pale
fix
golden
copper
orange
fluffy
white
cloud
of
froth
graces
the
surface
lacing
is
more
than
adequate
sweet
candy
like
aroma
spliced
with
some
peppery
spice
notes
some
doughball
aromas
as
well
flavor
is
o
k
but
lacks
the
character
and
complexity
to
make
it
anything
more
than
o
k
sweetly
malty
slightly
alcoholic
peppery
faint
yeast
esters
body
is
medium
or
so
on
the
high
end
of
the
carbonation
chart
but
appropriate
nonetheless
this
is
a
decent
drink
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
could
be
a
very
good
summer
drinker
it
doesnt
stand
out
though
overall
nice
bubblegum
flavors
mingled
with
fruit
and
yeast
very
nice
flavors
right
from
the
start
i
really
liked
it
thin
in
the
mouth
with
light
prickly
carbonation
slightest
bit
of
metallic
twang
lingering
overall
lacking
in
herbal
character
from
hops
both
aromatic
and
in
flavor
but
is
wellrounded
overall
overall
finally
i
like
one
of
the
furthermore
brews
easily
the
best
of
the
group
i
bought
from
france
44
good
solid
belgian
ale
with
an
interesting
and
somewhat
complex
taste
cool
name
as
well
d
this
one
goes
down
very

the
best

beer
i
have
tried
so
far
drinkability
high
served
chilled
in
a
westmalle
chalice
the
only
thing
to
really
point
out
that
would
ever
need
to
be
pulled
back
is
the
amount
of
yeast
in
this
beer
even
decanting
two
thirds
of
the
beer
brought
on
the
opaque
look
so
swirling
in
the
rest
made
no
difference
all
of
the
characteristics
point
right
to
belgian
white
ale
even
with
the
bigger
bitterness
here
all
said
and
done
this
is
an
enjoyable
belgianstyle
ale
with
certainly
more
oomph

compared
to
the
typical
belgian
white
ale
this
is
an
impressive
first
stab
at
belgianstylings
by
a
newish
brewery
kudos
here
d
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
the
brewers
are
doing
everything
right
the
label
simply
defines
it
as
a
belgian
style
ale
with
a
bunch
of
other
marketing
fluff
so
their
intent
is
tough
to
pin
down
id
certainly
pin
it
in
the
saison
belgian
pale
ale
realm
if
thats
vague
enough
d
enjoyable
for
an
american
take
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
went
down
leisurely
and
smooth
this
was
my
first
offering
from
furthermore
and
i
have
to
say
im
impressed
probably
not
a
true
belgian
but
im
choosing
to
think
of
this
as
creativity
rather
than
inadequacy
the
color
is
an
intriguing
translucent
apricot
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
a
stream
of
fine
bubbles
rises
throughout
the
time
the
beer
is
in
the
glass
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
which
i
put
in
quotes
only
because
its
getting
to
be
a
common
comment
from
me
but
usually
its
a
negative

distinctive
taste
with
an
attractive
color
and
smell
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
style
beers
and
what
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
good
but
its
missing
the
wow
factor
it
is
light
or
liquid
in
its
mouthfeel
which
just
doesnt
make
it
feel
like
an
iconic
belgian
beer
but
its
delicious
and
so
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
the
perfect
way
to
describe
this
beer
it
is
the
evolution
of
bmc
bud
miller
coors
beers
if
you
know
someone
who
likes
bmc
beers
i
cant
imagine
that
they
could
dislike
this
beer
id
venture
that
this
would
be
the
best
beer
they
ever
drank
that
might
sound
like
a
weird
way
to
describe
the
beer
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
light
beer
like
bmc
but
with
the
outstanding
flavor
of
a
belgian
beer
mixed
together
so
it
is
light
and
effervescent
but
also
flavorful
it
stands
at
a
nice
6
8
alcohol
too
this
would
be
great
in
the
summer
time
or
warmer
weather
i
was
able
to
get
it
for
about
2
50
per
bottle
which
is
just
too
much
for
what
it
is
if
it
was
offered
for
1
50
per
bottle
in
a
six
pack
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
beer
at
parties
for
groups
of
people
since
i
know
everyone
could
drink
it
from
beer
snob
to
a
bmc
drinker
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
liked
it
the
first
sip
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
by
the
end
of
it
i
felt
like
a
monk
gave
me
his
blessing
o
a
decent
americanmade
bpa
organic
as
well
that
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
but
is
still
a
solid
drinker
pick
some
up
if
youre
into
the
whole
organic
thing
or
enjoy
the
rest
of
uintas
brews
really
really
good
for
a
newer
brewery
such
as
this
my
only
complaint
which
is
hardly
such
is
that
it
isnt
sold
by
the
sixer
as
much
as
uinta
tries
to
convince
you
that
this
beer
deserves
to
be
savored
thats
so
shit
its
not
that
special
but
definitely
out
the
glass
sans
bottle
12oz
bottle
served
in
a

a
lovely
tangerinecolored
hue
with
a
slight
haze
to
the
clarity
and
a
frothy
34
inch
bright
white
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
consistent
slick
nose
is
very
much
akin
to
a
witte
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
nose
however
the
fruit
comes
off
a
bit
more
candied
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
a
pleasant
lively
carbonation
all
and
all
simple
and
somewhat
clean

quite
pleasant

clean

is

is

about

very
plain

boring

at

with

other
singles
a
great
policy
bravo
whole

i
like
it
and
would
happily
serve
it
again
check
expiry
date
when
buying
singles
mine
was
5
months
old
but
still
perfect
but
all
the
same
5
months
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
quaffable
an
understated
belgian
style
a
beer
doesnt
need
to
be
bold
to
be
good
this
beer
everything
is
quite
subtle
and
it
works
out
nicely
overall
not
bad
hits
the
spot
for
a
belgian
golden
ale
and
should
be
8
but
only
clocks
in
at
6
8
somehow
otherwise
typical
flavors
and
characteristics
this
beer
isnt
very
complex
the
yeast
does
all
the
work
imparting
esters
some
faint
spicyness
but
even
those
flavors
dont
keep
me
interested
for
long
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
subdued
and
toned
down
it
was
nice
to
try
once
but
i
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
overallcomments
a
good
belgian
style
blonde
ale
here
nothing
spectacular
but
a

representation
of
the

picked
this

utah
classified
as
a
belgian
pale

at

8
abv
brewed
on

consumed
on

the
taste
is
semi
sweet
with
a
touch
a
bitterness
not
much
complexity
way
to
clean
for
a
belgian
blond
imo
not
much
to
glean
from
this
beer
its
drinkable
i
guess
but
i
would
think
the
yeast
selection
along
with
the
filterering
just
take
out
all
the
character
of
this
beer
pretty
disappointing
o
starting
to
take
the
plunge
into
belgian
ales
this
one
being
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
i
think
is
a
great
foray
into
the
world
of
belgian
goldenpale
ales
overall
i
was
very
impressed
i
found
the
flavors
to
be
very
pronounced
and
bold
and
complex
is
a
word
which
really
describes
this
type
of
ale
cant
wait
to
sample
more
like
this
pick
it
up
serving
type
bottle
what
happened
to
the
flavor
if
this
is
what
its
suppose
to
be
sorry
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
very
dry
beers
meh
i
am
a
bit
biased
being
not
that
into
belgian
styles
in
the
first
place
but
this
just
lacked
anything
interesting
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
oi
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
fridge
i
will
drink
it
but
will
i
buy
it
again
maybe
i
have
had
better
belgian
ales
before
o
very
impressed
with
this
belgian
pale
ale
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
and
probably
will
pick
up
a
few
6
packs
when
i
see
it
in
a
shop
a
lot
of
yeast
spice
and
a
nice
overall
fruit
feel
drinks
easily
and
brings
strong
belgian
influence
d
such
a
beery
beer
i
would
get
this
again
quality
unita
is
so
underrated
everything
ive
ever
had
from
them
has
been
solid
without
fail
and
this
is
another
good
showing
this
is
a
very
clear
beer
nice
looking
though
nose
is
super
yeasty
at
first
and
then
dies
down
to
nothing
quite
quickly
flavor
is
full
heavy
yeast
tones
again
with
strong
bread
character
as
well
there
are
tones
of
banana
on
here
as
well
a
little
thick
in
the
mouth
but
it
works
most
belgian
ales
seem
to
be
a
disaster
but
i
can
appreciate
this
one
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
rounded
on
the
profile
but
ive
definitely
had
some
horrid
belgian
ales
out
of
the
us
this
is
not
one
of
them
very
dry
finish
and
highly
attenuated
throughout
with
just
mild
sweetness
emerging
as
the
beer
comes
to
room
temperature
the
flavor
goes
with
the
faint
aroma
light
fruitpeach
or
apricot
some
grass
and
light
earth
hop
the
dry
finish
reveals
some
mild
bitterness
and
spicy
yeasty
notes
finish
is
clean
but
over
quickly
highly
drinkable
but
unremarkable
it
is
just
really
plain
there
is
nothing
that
distinguishes
it
besides
its
gorgeous
appearance
from
a
12

bottle
pours

cloudy
orangish
color
with

offwhite

on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level

with
a

mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
overall
when
the
mouthfeel
is
the
thing
you
like
best
about
a
beer
you
know
you
are
in
trouble
in
this
case
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
malt
beer
and
the
kick
of
alcohol
particularly
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
the
hint
of
lemon
in
the
finish
was
a
nice
touch
but
it
didnt
make
up
for
the
rest
overall
doesnt
taste
like
anything
belgian
to
me
rather
disappointing
imo
i
was
pretty
surprised
at
how
bad
this
beer
was
quite
pale
almost
lagerish
in
color
smell
is
pretty
simple
light
but
with
some
alcohol
to
it
flavor
is
very
starchy
with
a
stale
cereal
quality
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
acrid
overall
pretty
disappointing
overall
not
a
badtasting
brew
at
all
but
not
very
complex
or
fun
to
think
about
overall
i
like
the
beer
the
mixture
of
clove
spices
and
malt
is
nice
the
abv
is
still
enough
to
get
the
job
done
and
the
carbonation
of
the
brew
is
different
but
not
overpowering
as
a
side
note
the
label
on
the
bottle
that
i
purchased
is
different
than
the
label
in
the
picture
12oz
bottle
pours
bright
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
holds
no
retention
and
leaves
no
lace
looks
like
apple
juice
smells
like
apple
juice
too
tastes
like
apple
juice
with
some
grape
qualities
dry
white
wine
perhaps
earthy
herbal
hops
fruity
with
a
slight
belgian
flare
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
with
no
carbonation
finishes
dry
like
a
cheap
chardonnay
alcohol
is
well
concealed
for
6
8
overall
i
dont
know
what
to
think
of
this
one
i
see
other
reviews
are
giving
this
a
higher
score
but
this
wasnt
any
different
than
drinking
a
glass
of
apple
juice
mixed
with
some
cheap
white
wine
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
this
beer
taste
great
has
a
little
mineral
quality
on
the
finish
that
just
completes
everything
easy
to
drink
and
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
overall
this
was
a
surprise
a
really
good
belgian
style
beer
like
a
duvel
light
and
at
a
bargain
price
ive
been
impressed
with
uinta
d
overall
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
something
i
would
reach
for
again
there
are
better
belgian
pale
ales
out
there
needs
a
little
more
body
and
a
more
defined
identity
i
feel
belgian
pale
ale
have
a
unique
balance
of
spice
malt
hop
flavor
this
beer
seems
a
little
all
over
the
place
a
largely
unremarkable
brew
except
that
it
is
of
very
high
quality
pours
light
lager
color
yellow
with
a
nice
1
inch
foam
head
bone
white
smells
mild
hops
and
belgian
sweetness
taste
is
much
less
hoppy
than
any
american
pale
ale
but
less
yeasty
and
bright
than
a
typical
belgian
a
sort
of
boring
hybrid
of
styles
but
again
very
well
made
mouthfeel
is
nice
super
light
and
drinkable
a
pretty
good
beer
if
your
looking
for
something
down

and
with
an
elevated
abv
it
serves
its
purpose
organic
quite
tasty

that
comes

the
beer

nice
subtle
complex
flavor
hints
of
clove
full

finishes
dry
but
at
the
last
second
some
sweet
creeps
in

i
like
this
and
would
get
it
again

well
with
a
seltzery
finish
it
seems
like
the
belgian
yeast
notes
havent
really
matured
here
id
say
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
beer
fruity
light
spice
a
wiff
of
nutty
yeast
delicate
hopping
subtle
belgian
characteristics
nice
summer
time
offering
would
be
quite
worthy
with
a
meal
of
salads
cheese
and
other
lighter
fare
overall
i
think
id
not
recommend
this
drink
to
many
i
find
uinta
falling
short
on
my
list
from
what
ive
had
from
them
and
this
doesnt
bring
much
either
overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
o
it
tastes
like
a
lightly
hopped
apa
with
belgian
yeast
o
nice
brew
i
would
certainly
have
again
light
and
sparkling
slick
and
easy
to
drink
surprisingly
nice
o
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
found
it
to
be
fairly
good
for
a
belgian
ale
this
really
needs
to
have
more
substance
to
it
the
beer
pours
out
yellow
and
has
some
decent
head
on
it
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
bland
in
flavor
there
isnt
much
other
than
some
belgian
yeast
flavors
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
there
just
isnt
anything
standing
out
to
me
in
this
brew
i
strongly
feel
that
this
beer
could
have
been
a
lot
better
with
some
more
time
and
effort
put
into
it
overall
this
beer
is
way
too
simple
and
devoid
of
all
the
upfront
yeast
character
that
is
tradition
in
belgian
ales
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
having
this
again
sadly
this
6er
was
the
first
brew
from
uinta
that
i
have
not
really
liked
the
good
news
is
it
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
6
and
was
pretty
darn
cheep
at
just
over
6
dollars
for
the
6
pack
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smeel
is
alive
with
fruits
yeast
some
spice
taste
is
good
fruits
and
spice
slightly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
brew
12oz
bottle
pours
hazy
golden
with
chunky
white
head
active
carbonation
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
pepper
ripe
banana
and
some
citrus
taste
is
sweet
with
a
definite
but
smooth
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
thick
mouthfeel
finish
is
bitter
that
bitterness
is
pretty
tame
but
it
seems
to
amplify
the
more
you
drink
the
bitterness
becomes
distracting
to
me
but
i
do
think
its
a
well
made
beer
pours
with
a
nice
foamy
frothy
medium
sized
off
white
head
that
lasts
a
bit
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
malt
caramel
yeast
and
a
bit
of
fruit
which
is
alltogether
mild
as
a
whole
flavor
is
a
little
bubblegum
and
white
wine
a
little
fruity
sweet
not
too
bad
body
is
good
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
short
length
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
has
some
decent
notes
to
it
but
is
lacking
the
classic
belgian
mouthfeel
a
worthy
bpa
but
could
use
more
balance
d
i
think
this
is
a
beer
tailor
made
for
people
who
enjoy
the
occasional
beer
this
isnt
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
having
more
than
a
glass
of
mainly
due
to
the
taste
towards
the
beginning
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
more
for
occasions
rather
than
a
session
beer
light
to
medium
on
the
palate
some
sweet
pear
sweet
apple
and
tart
apple
provide
a
nice
mix
to
the
malt
up
front
dry
through
the
center
the
finish
has
clove
and
spice
this
is
a
balanced
solid
brew
the
fruity
yeast
nicely
complements
the
spice
in
the
finish
i
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
a
little
metallic
and
jarring
at
first
but
fairly
creamy
by
the
end
not
a
bad
stab
at
this
style
which
although
its
not
my
favorite
belgian
is
definitely
underrated
in
the
us
brewers
make
more
of
these
beers
im
a
little
dissapointed
by
the
metallic
flavor
and
the
low
amount
of
tasty
belgian
yeast
characteristics
drinkability
the
thumb
points
down
on
this
one
many
beers
could
benefit
from
tweak
or
two
to
get
things
back
on
track
others
just
need
to
be
scrapped
this
is
a
case
of
the
latter
pretty
good
drinking
but
becomes
boring
after
a
bit
dont
think
this
one
could
handle
food
pairings
of
cheese
or
fish
md
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
decent
flavor
that
is
easy
to
drink
pretty
standard
and
nothing
too
amazing
pours
a
sparkling
golden
color
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
fluffy
white
foam
aromas
of
white
pepper
belgian
yeast
and
candi
sugar
a
little
biscuit
malt
on
the
palate
along
with
apples
pears
and
a
little
dark
spice
a
nice
refreshing
beer
enjoyable
on
a
hot
afternoon
drinkability
this
beer
was
pleasant
but
it
grew
a
bit
tiring
on
me
as
the
glass
emptied
md
light
bodied
didnt
really
pack
a
pale
ale
feel
and
drinkability
almost
feels
and
drunks
like
a
coors
drinkability
cool
name
cool
bottle
but
avg
craft
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
have
had
better
belgian
pales
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highlights
the
sourness
on
the
finish
another
brew
from
four
that
was
better
than
i
expected
in
general
if
somethings
good
enough
to
ship
out
of
utah
its
probably
pretty
damned
good
overall
a
pleasant
and
relatively
full
bodied
pale
ale
it
has
a
nice
apple
taste
malty
some
caramel
sweet
very
smooth
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
vice
nice
balanced
beer
d
easy
drinking
and
pretty
average
nothing
spectacular
d
fairly
good
sharp
and
tight
from
the
bubbly
nature
of
the
carbonation
providing
a
nice
crispness
associated
per
style
soft
belgain
yeasty
attributes
fit
in
well
here
not
over
the
top
or
will
challenge
for
contender
for
belgian
pale
of
the
year
but
none
the
less
a
fairly
decent
attempt
from
a
little
known
east
coast
american
brewery
stands
the
test
of
time
and
delivers
so
worth
a
try
pours
a
luminous
golden
color
with
no
haze
and
a
modest
sized
white
head
nose
has
some
alcohol
punch
on
it
with
light
fruits
such
as
peachespears
some
bready
esters
are
present
also
as
well
as
on
the
palate
some
resembles
a
few
qualities
of
a
tripel
but
in
a
more
drinkable
format
finish
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
quite
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
given
the
relatively
low
abv
overall
i
found
this
one
to
be
rather
lacking
it
seemed
to
have
a
lot
of
alcohol
taste
for
only
6
8
and
really
lacked
anything
of
substance
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
its
the
only
thing
that
ive
had
from
four
and
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
monkshine
is
a
pleasant
surprise
out
of
left
field
who
would
have
thought
that
a
brewery
from
utah
uinta
would
be
able
to
kick
ass
and
take
names
when
it
comes
to
the
creation
of
a
belgianstyle
pale
ale
this
is
good
beer
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
buy
it
or
trade
for
it
this
is
a
very
good
attempt
at
belgian
style
and
i
will
definitely
try
again
d
interesting
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
personally
the
flavors
get
a
bit
bland
after
a
while
and
the
hop
character
on
this
one
is
pretty
minimal
not
a
horrible
beer
but
pretty
average
overall
d
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
the
alcohol
presence
in
the
flavor
makes
it
seem
stronger
than
it
is
its
not
as
complex
as
the
best
members
of
this
style
but
still
a
worthy
beer
in
my
book
thanks
to
wasatch
for
this
one
via
a
recent
trade
i
think
that
just
about
does
it
for
all
the
utah
beers
ive
had
in
the
fridge
this
past
month
future
outlook
very
solid
accessible
bpa
that
is
probably
pretty
sessionable
but
no
matter
as
i
cant
get
this
stuff
here
drinkability
very
drinkable
flavorful
and
nice
feel
would
have
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
instead
of
the
other
one
i
purchased
interesting
label
pours
a
clear
golden
body
beneath
a
full
head
of
dense
brightwhite
froth
head
retention
and
lacing
could
be
better
fine
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
quickly
lots
of
clove
in
the
nose
a
note
of
vanilla
a
bit
of
earthiness
as
well
and
some
minor
sulphur
sweetish
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
creamy
smooth
the
flavor
is
mainly
sweetish
and
doughy
golden
malt
and
yeasty
earthiness
spiciness
and
clove
and
vanilla
some
leafy
hops
are
present
as
well
but
the
sweetish
almost
candyish
maltiness
is
clearly
the
showpiece
restrained
bitterness
long
lingering
finish
4
abv
im
not
sure
about
that
but
it
is
from
utah
so
of
course
it
is
right
i
said
the
same
thing
about
their
wild
fire
extra
pale
ale
i
dont
think
it
will
turn
any
beer
geek
heads
but
its
a
pretty
good
initiation
to
this
style
of
belgian
beer
for
everyone
else
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
aftertaste
very
drinkable
just
not
spectacular
very
much
case
worthy
d
beer
was
pretty
smooth
and
not
real
filling
so
in
fairness
easy
to
drink
just
not
much
very
special
about
the
beer
overall
impression
this
one
has
subtle
flavors
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
immemorable
sums
it
up
d
high
level
of
drinkability
very
sessionable
for
me
this
is
kind
of
like
if
budweiser
were
a
belgian
ale
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
seems
like
it
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
to
me
i
can
imagine
one
by
a
pool
d
i
have
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
probably
go
back
for
a
six
pack
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
lots
of
good
flavors
not
4
0
though
no
way
overall
not
a
bad
little
beer
a
bit
light
but
still
very
good
nice
use
of
light
hops
and
not
too
heavy
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
no
problem
overall
a
very
poor
resemblance
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
dont
think
that
they
use
corn
to
make
it
i
didnt
not
like
this
beer
i
think
it
came
from
budweiser
this
is
not
an
impressive
beer
and
struck
me
as
an
amaturish
effort
im
thinking
this
is
a
beer
and
brewery
to
be
avoided
o
peppery
earthy
full
of
belgianutah
goodness
a
well
brewed
piece
of
work
pours
a
light
golden
orange
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
of
sweet
and
hoppy
the
taste
starts
out
smooth
and
crisp
then
moves
to
hoppy
spices
but
finishes
with
easy
citrus
flavors
great
mouthfeel
you
get
everything
without
the
damage
really
drinkable
a
totally
competent
rendition
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
pretty
impressive
for
a
4
abv
beer
easily
drinkable
and
the
low
abv
lends
itself
to
enjoying
several
in
one
sitting
this
has
a
lot
of
fermentation
character
packed
into
it
without
being
overly
funky
it
is
actually
much
nicer
than
i
was
expecting
though
i
wasnt
really
expecting
anything
as
i
have
no
experience
with
this
brewery
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lingering
and
the
drinkability
on
this
is
ok
there
is
a
noticeable
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
definitely
drink
this
one
at
proper
temp
and
dont
let
it
warm
too
much
its
best
at
the
correct
temperature
for
sure
d
overall
its
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
just
not
a
style
i
enjoy
as
much
it
is
not
terribly
complex
but
given
the
very
low
alcohol
for
such
a
tasty
brew
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
around
during
summer
very
few
session
beers
taste
like
this
body
is
a
little
thin
and
the
finish
is
long
dry
and
bitter
overall
not
a
bad
especially
at
only
4
abv
its
very
flavorful

i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
belgian
pale
but
all
the
elements
are
there
earthy
belgian
flavors
with
the
hoppy
bite
of
pale
ale
very
interesting
i
usually
like
these
two
styles
independently
but
they
are
a
good
fit
together
in
this
brew
actually
the
start
is
belgian
and
in
the
finish
the
pale
ale
comes
through
with
a
very
broad
semi
bitterness
that
lingers
two
beers
in
one
salud
sampled
from
a
complimentary
bottle
in
the
delta
crown
room
at
the
slc
airport
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
color
with
golden
highlights
topped
by
a
whispy
bubbly
head
that
isnt
much
to
look
at
nose
is
predominantly
spicy
belgian
yeast
with
notes
of
coriander
and
allspice
along
with
some
tangy
european
hops
palate
is
a
nice
balance
between
light
sweet
malt
and
euro
hops
along
with
some
subtle
spices
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
more
foamy
than
creamy
a
soso
interpretation
of
a
good
belgian
style
wouldnt
have
it
again
especially
if
i
had
to
pay
for
it
this
was
my
first
beer
from
utah
and
hopefully
the
rest
arent
like
this
one
it
started
out
kind
of
nice
with
its
very
fluffy
head
and
super
cloudy
body
then
it
just
went
down
hill
from
there
the
smell
was
pretty
much
average
for
the
style
except
it
lacked
the
alcoholy
hint
in
it
the
taste
was
pretty
much
blah
nothing
really
stood
out
to
write
about
the
mouthfeel
was
more
of
a
champainge
than
a
beer
it
was
really
bubbly
and
thin
on
the
palate
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
its
another
state
in
the
annols
of
beer
reviews
12
ounce
bottle
just
purchased
at
bon
vivant
in
smithfield
va
for
1
75
best
before
72105
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
lightcrystal
and
bisquit
malts
it
also
has
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
bitter
and
a
bit
earthy
there
is
some
malt
complexity
here
but
the
dry
earthy
finish
diminishes
the
overall
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
different
tasting
belgian
brew
i
like
the
complexity
but
the
overall
flavor
needs
some
work
drinkability
is
good
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
would
be
great
summer
brew
overall
probably
wouldnt
chose
again
if
a
better
pale
was
available
picked
this
up
at
the
vintage
cellar
strange
it
only
has
two
reviews
prior
to
this
one
first
off
i
cannot
believe
someone
else
has
tried
this
brew
i
guess
its
a
new
brewery
dated
102805
i
like
this
when
a
brewery
puts
a
date
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
real
nice
head
which
lingers
alittle
while
theres
a
nice
trace
of
lacing
left
for
the
whole
duration
has
a
wheatmalty
scent
with
a
nice
lightmedium
body
never
had
a
belgian
pale
ale
before
so
i
cannot
comment
on
that
but
it
does
remind
me
of
a
hefeweizen
this
is
a
very
social
brew
maybe
a
slight
haze
but
mostly
clear
golden
copper
body
with
a
thick
steady
offwhitecream
head
tangy
belgian
malt
aroma
with
light
sugar
sweetness
spices
maybe
some
clove
or
nutmeg
and
a
sourdough
yeastiness
taste
light
crisp
wheat
malt
up
front
faint
candyish
sweetness
barely
registers
kind
of

without

over

possibly
a

pretty

undrinkable
not
a

belgian
pale

here
this
has
more
hop
flavor
than
many
so
credit
where
its
due
the
nose
is
pungent

musty
body
light
and
crisp
and
flavor
more

balanced
a
beer
i
could
session
though
it
is
slightly
abrasive
the
finish
knocks
this
down
a
few
pegs
for
me
however
up
front
is
a
nice
hoppy
pale
ale
wheat
malt
and
coarsefiltered
rather
than
bottleconditioned
for
sure
a
bit
hoppy
but
mainly
bitter
not
particularly
nice
floral
tones
from
the
hops
a
little
boring
just
had
a
second
bottle
and
it
just
really
reminded
me
of
pbr
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
a
generally
agreeable
bpa
one
whose
mantra
of
extra
hoppy
is
played
out
well
enough
i
suppose
for
the
conservative
brussels
crowd
even
if
this
reviewer
is
a
little
nonplussed
easy
to
drink
the
kind
of
beer
that
once
you
get
through
half
of
it
all
the
while
relating
it
via
words
you
feel
the
urge
to
just
say
fuck
it
close
the
laptop
and
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
i
only
mention
this
because
that
doesnt
happen
very
often
o
pretty
damn
tasty
lovely
showcase
of
hop
bitterness
heard
this
guy
say
hes
more
a
fan
of
english
ales
and
it
shows
in
this
one
comes
across
as
a
sort
of
hybrid
english
bitter
and
small
saison
curious
to
try
it
over
there
held
up
pretty
well
here
again
huge

seem
to
cover
up

not

about

popped

the

hits
with

the

go
for
this
if
you
get

chance
overall
i
want
to
like
this
beer
so
much
that
i
want
to
look
past
the
seemingly
overhopped
bittering
hops
but
the
bitterness
simply
detracts
too
much
maybe
if
it
was
a
little
older
the
bittering
would
fade
and
the
flavors
would
mellow
out
a
refreshing
and
fairly
light
in
terms

d
decently

my
cup

i
dont

it

a
beer
which
is
quite

stands
out

go
for
it

interesting

i

i

it
is
a

more
than

hope
for
such
a

ill
definitely
be
trying
to
reproduce
this

i

the

the
retention
stuck
around
the
whole

drinking
and
an
interestingly
it
appeared
the

retention
created
an
island
within
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
aromatics
mostly
yeast
driven
it
seems
gives
of
an
interesting
phenol
that
plays
well
with
the
soft
spicy

notes
present
from
the
hops
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
its
semi
sweetness
finishes
comfortably
dry
what
makes
this
beverage
above

is
the
mouthfeel
it
has
a
high
carbonation
level
that
does
not
effect
the
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
there
is
no

this

something
to

a
friend
of
mine
says
this
is
his
favorite
beer
and
i
do
agree
that
its
very
nice
and
well
constructed
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
a
few
separate
times
at
moeder
and
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
tasty
goodforanynormalday
sort
of
beer
at
first
i
was
pretty
thrown
off
by
all
of
the
wild
spicy
and
earthy
flavors
but
the
more
i
consumed
this
the
more
i
realized
that
a
belgium
take
on
an
american
session
beer
is
pretty
great
as
you
do
get
the
slightly
fruity
funky
yeasty
phenols
here
as
well
as
the
spices
and
dried
hop
resins
without
having
to
worry
about
getting
plastered
after
one
or
two
glasses
im
looking
at
you
westmalle
tripel
a
very
good
offering
from
de
la
senne
and
probably
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
had
recently
thats
under
5
i
could
stock
up
on
these
in
the
future
for
casual
evenings
no
doubt
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
the
beer
has
a
low
abv
and
wonderful
tastesmell
of
yeast
and
hops
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
and
it
was
refreshing
on
this
warm
spring
afternoon
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
belgian
pale
that
could
serve
as
a
everyday
beer
o
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
the
beer
very
sessionable
but
it
is
still
packed
with
lots
of
hoppy
and
yeasty
flavors
making
it
comparable
to
some
of
the
top
belgian
pale
ales
overall
quite
good
indeed
unique
and
nice

the

offerings
in

havent
ever
had
a

for
being

the
floral
notes
of
the

will
complement

of

the

will
cleanse

allow

the

really
gives
off
lots
of
nice
grainy

with
some
floral

in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a

on

it
had
some

along
with
some
sweet

too
the
mouthfeel
was

overall
this
brew
was

not

it
was
okay
didnt
compete
with
the

the

is
thin
at

but
becomes
more
bitter

and

with
a
pale

to
become

a
nice
refreshing
beer
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
pretty
simple
o
very
nice
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
going
in
the
citrus
qualities
and
spicy
hoppy
bitterness
really
made
the
experience
for
me
recommended
b
pours
a
semihazy
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
and
gobs
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
straw
and
wheat
with
some
faint
hops
nice
and
inviting
but
nothing
too
exceptional
the
flavor
really
takes
a
turn
in
a
positive
direction
with
plenty
of
floral
hops
to
combine
with
the
light
malt
light
body
and
good
bitterness
solidlydry
finish
high
carbonation
and
super
crisp
dls
does
it
again
fantastic
brew
o
low
alcohol
and
great
drinkability
i
would
try
it
again
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
an
average
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
i
enjoyed
it
probably
wont
order
it
again
for
a
while
but
definitely
worth
trying
o
another
nice
light
beer
with
a
pretty
solid
hop
character
jd
a
tough
one
to
get
into
from
the
get
go
give
this
some
time
to
grow
on
you
d
a
crisp
and
refreshing
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
super
hoppy
but
it
is
bitter
bigger
on
the
bready
citrus
almost
like
a
saison
at
the
same
time
o
lots
of
spices
and
a
nice
bitterness
could
go
a
long
way
but
this
one
lacks
body
a
really
good
beer
flavour
is
a
bit
thin
diluted
notes
of
honey
and
bitter
hops
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
bitter
in
a
manner
similar
to
tonic
water
on
the
end
a
highly
drinkable
and
surprisingly
bitter
flavour
very
refreshing
it
is
a
decent
beer
my
bottle
might
be
old
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
1
inch
head
that
becomes
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
spotty
bits
of
lace
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
yeast
watery
citrus
hops
and
malt
tastes
of
watery
malt
subdued
citrus
hops
and
yeast
somewhat
abrasive
hop
bitterness
after
each
sip
not
too
good
good
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
hard
to
find
belgian
beer
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
taras
boulba
is
incredibly
smooth
mostly
as
a
result
of
the
fine
carbonation
the
finish
is
dryer
than
average
it
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
thanks
northyorksammy
d
drinkable
and
decent
i
would
not
purchase
myself
again
but
would
pass
along
to
another
to
spread
the
wealth
d
not
bad
worth
a
try
not
sure
how
often
ill
go
back
though
but
definitely
worth
a
try
low
abv
makes
this
perfect
for
a
lay
sunny
afternoon
extra
hoppy
ale
is
what
it
says
on
the
label
and
thats
what
this
beer
delivers
great
session
beer
actually
a
bit
to
unbalanced
hoppiness
i
lack
a
body
to
help
it
be
refreshing
i
understand
gogol
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
all
the
great
russian
writers
but
i
doubt
even
he
could
have
devised
a
character
so
memorable
and
unique
as
this
in
fact
this
is
my
favourite
belgian
character
since
hercule
poirot
while
admittedly
it
does
a
take
a
great
deal
of
its
character
from
the
american
hops
theres
no
mistaking
that
its
intricacy
balance
and
the
firstrate
of
its
craftsmanship
were
undoubtedly
the
work
of
a
belgian
mind
cheers
d
this
stuff
rocks
simply
beautiful
brew
super
drinkable
and
a
blast
to
quaff
worth
the
wait
to
find
it
on
draft
on

a

a

a

good

and

a
light
sweet
aroma
of
honey
and
grain
mostly
the
same
on
the
taste
a
light
tasting
but
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
brew
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellowish
with
a
somewhat
small
coarse
head
smell
is
floral
and
herbal
with
a
saisonlike
essence
a
faint
funk
and
yeast
also
is
pleasant
taste
is
lemony
and
herbalflowery
with
barely
a
trace
of
malt
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
watery
overall
a
good
sessionable
pale
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white

the
aroma
was
floral

was
light

floral

very
fresh
smelling
belgian

in
the
background
the
hops
steal
the
show
here
taste
follows
smell
firm
hop
bitterness
followed
by
a
very
floral
hop
flavor
a
hint
of
rosewater
a
very
unique
hop
profile
some
light
malts
and
a
nice
bready
yeast
finish
to
help
balance
out
the
hops
a
little
a
light
body
with
a
medium
carbonation
the
hop
flavor
coats
and
gives
an
interesting
finish
drinkability
is
very
good
i
love
finding
a
beer
that
has
lower
abv
and
great
flavor
if
this
was
easier
to
find
i
would
drink
it
much
more
often
the
taste
is
really
great
slightly
more
hoppy
than
a
houblon
or
local
1
and
very
tasty
im
definitely
going
to
go
find
some
more
d
highly
palatable
but
intensely
dry
drinks
have
never
been
highly
quaffable
for
me
nevertheless
taras
boulba
drinks
very
well
particulary
the
first
one
or
two
glasses
d
nice
bpa
lower
in
alcohol
than
most
but
still
pretty
fullflavoured
a
session
beer
for
belgium
d
this
is
really
great
goes
down
wonderfully
to
the
point
of
being
dangerous
pale
but
bitter
just
really
enjoyable
this
is
an
outstanding
belgian
pale
ale
and
incredibly
sessionable
and
quenching
for
its
weight
it
will
not
be
replacing
orval
any
time
soon
but
its
a
beautifully
crafted
beer
with
finesse
and
style
then
again
i
dont
really
remember
what
orval
tastes
like
i
remember
that
it
was
damned
impressive
for
its
size
that
it
managed
to
cram
in
most
of
the
best
belganiness
of
a
good
dubbel
only
without
much
of
the
alcohol
burn
this
is
like
that
theres
a
goddamn
turkishmarketsworth
of
ripe
fruit
in
there
along
with
maybe
the
nicest
belgian
yeast
profile
ive
ever
come
across
its
all
the
nice
flavors
you
normally
associate
with
burn
only
theres
no
burn
and
the
aftertaste
is
superb
it
tastes
the
way
an
old
dusty
beerstore
smells
only
in
no
way
gross
one
sip
of
this
and
its
like
im
standing
in
the
middle
of
johns
grocery
herbal
floral
zesty
hops
hit
the
palate
first
quickly
matched
by
bready
and
earthy
malts
white
pepperlike
spiciness
strong
lemon
rind
bitterness
this
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
complexity
but
it
never
feels
heavier
than
its
4
5
abv
light
and
thirstquenching
dry
from
front
to
back
im
really
liking
the
balance
between
the
malt
hops
and
yeast
theres
a
touch
of
medicinal
phenols
in
the
finish
that
remind
me
of
aged
orval
faint
enough
to
add
an
interesting
complexity
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
seems
to
grow
with
each
sip
lingering
for
minutes
in
between
sips
exhibiting
an
herbal
and
lemon
peellike
character
such
a
great
beer
overall
a
great
flavorful
summer
session
beer
proves
that
a
low
abv
doesnt
mean
low
in
flavor
and
complexity
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
witbier
on
the
terrace
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
its
just
too
bad
this
one
isnt
distributed
more
widely
highly
recommended
low
abv
excellent
flavor
very
refreshing
a
wonderfully
sessionable
belgian
ale
md
carbonation
i
allright
but
it
does
have
a
soapy
feel
to
it
abvlevel
is
fine
when
i
get
back
to
homebrewing
i
will
attempt
something
like
this
fantastic
stuff
this
is
a
great
beer
theres
a
certain
cohesion
between
the
seemingly
incongruous
elements
that
makes
it
a
really
drinkable
pale
ale
a
refreshing
light
beer
and
highly
drinkable
at
under
5
abv
d
a
bit
of
a
one
dimensional
beer
with
bitter
bitter
hops
and
not
much
else
malt
is
secondary
hop
flavor
is
nonexistent
i
guess
im
probably
used
tospoiled
by
excellent
american
interpretations
with
way
more
hop
character
i
guess
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
its
good
but
i
have
no
need
to
have
another
now
and
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
out
either
too
many
other
good
beers
out
there
to
revisit
this
one
d
smells
and
tastes
nice
but
the
bloaty
feeling
keeps
me
from
wanting
a
second
glass
this
particular
day
d
moderate
i
really
enjoyed
it
id
like
to
see
it
in
a
larger
bottle
format
buying
a
few
of
these
small
bottles
to
drink
over
a
night
would
hurt
the
wallet
but
i
like
this
beer
while
not
extra
hoppy
it
is
more
than
sufficiently
hoppy
a
belgian
pale
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
to
it
nice
hv
pours
a
sunny
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
grainy
with
some
lemon
and
coriander
the
flavor
is
thin
and
lemony
with
a
strong
bite
of
coriander
and
allspice
there
is
a
grainy
almost
wheaty
body
with
a
distinct
aspriny
bitterness
the
finish
is
a
bit
weak
and
watery
however
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
watery
d
a
drinkable
pale
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
for
this
style
hopped
slightly
like
a
belgian
strong
yet
abv
is
at
level
of
a
pale
so
it
is
winwin
i
found
the
bitterness
to
be
substantial
and
if
it
werent
at
the
lowered
strength
it
is
could
be
compared
to
a
belgian
ipa
w
the
bitterness
recommended
the
nose
is
light
enough
where
unfortunately
we
do
detect
a
bit
of
hops
spices
and
resins
the
mouth
is
the
opposite
in
addition
to
being
quite
special
entry
in
the
mouth
rather
resinous
leading
to
flavors
of
anise
and
licorice
accented
and
highlighted
by
a
hops
and
yeast
quality
tasting
offers
a
body
quite
dry
with
a
strong
bitterness
that
breathes
the
fresh
hops
with
only
4
5
it
offers
much
flavor
in
the
mouth
and
can
be
drunk
in
large
quantities
a
classic
bitter
and
not
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
like
i
saw
it
yet
resolutely
belgian
i
could
drink
this
beer
any
time
any
place
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
user
friendly
farmhouse
ale
d
another
nice
take
on
the
belgian
ipa
very
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
find
it
md
medium
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
nicely
combined
flavors
and
not
so
funky
to
turn
people
off
a
nice
classic
belgian
the
beer
actually
didnt
last
this
long
it
was
quite
smooth
and
creamy
i
guess
thats
all
that
needs
to
be
said
about
its
drinkability
as
well
its
a
good
thing
its
only
4
5
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
generous
white
head
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
flowers
clean
minerals
grain
the
taste
is
up
front
minerals
sweetness
and
biscuit
in
the
middle
and
a
long
bitter
finish
its
highly
carbonated
a
little
viscous
nice
and
easy
to
drink
as
it
warms
wish
this
were
available
around
here
and
were
a
lot
cheaper
all
in
all
its
a
lot
like
a
mellower
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
fine
stuff
taste
pretty
much
follows
although
i
would
say
this
has
a
lightness
to
it
that
american
pales
dont
usually
have
the
malt
is
richer
and
not
as
wide
if
that
makes
sense
low
abv
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
for
me
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
liked
the
idea
of
a
hoppy
belgian
ale
this
poured
a
nice
rich
golden
color
in
the
tulip
glass
it
was
served
with
with
a
good
amount
of
head
that
clung
for
a
few
minutes
wellbalanced
smell
with
hops
dominating
the
taste
was
also
hoppy
up
front
but
none
of
the
bitter
aftertaste
of
ipas
this
beer
finished
with
a
sweet
smooth
flavor
that
was
refreshing
and
different
i
had
no
idea
until
i
got
home
that
this
beer
was
less
than
5
alcohol
if
it
didnt
cost
me
7
50
a
glass
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
a
delicious
ale
a
good
brew
this
one
would
work
nicely
with
chicken
francaise
a
great
session
brew
well
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
out
and
about
this
is
probably
my
favorite
sub5
abv
belgian
that
ive
tried
so
far
it
tastes
like
a
light
belgian
ipa
which
makes
sense
given
the
selfapplied
label
extra
hoppy
ale
i
chilled
it
down
a
bit
in
the
refrigerator
and
sidestepped
the
overflow
other
bas
have
reported
consequently
the
head
was
probably
a
bit
less
than
it
could
have
been
the
beer
is
a
glowing
hazy
yellowgold
liquid
with
a
puffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
dry
yeast
is
the
main
aroma
but
there
is
a
noticeable
tangerine
hop
undercurrent
the
beer
really
shines
on
the
palate
its
a
pretty
exceptional
beer
given
the
truly
sessionable
4
5
abv
both
malt
and
hops
shine
and
work
well
with
the
yeast
the
malt
is
light
but
fresh
and
flavorful
the
hops
give
the
beer
a
great
bite
in
the
aftertaste
and
provide
pleasing
bitterness
and
flavor
throughout
the
yeast
flavors
are
a
refined
and
restrained
belgian
complex
of
earth
and
must
this
is
one
of
those
great
foreign
session
beers
thats
sadly
too
expensive
to
drink
in
quantity
here
im
deeply
envious
of
belgians
and
anyone
else
lucky
enough
who
can
find
it
easily
and
cheaply
really
this
isnt
much
different
from
the
bottled
version
maybe
fresher
and
of
course
no
gushing
again
this
has
exceptional
depth
of
flavor
for
just
4
5
abv
quite
drinkable
and
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
lower
abv
beer
this
could
be
a
session
belgian
taste
again
has
some
citrus
and
lemony
hops
but
is
by
no
means
hoppy
if
anything
it
tastes
like
soapy
lemon
zest
not
particularly
appealing
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
i
think
a
beer
is
overly
carbonated
the
flavor
could
have
used
a
dampening
down
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
tall
white
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
leaving
some
lace
the
smell
was
a
wonderful
aromatic
hop
aroma
noble
coupled
with
effervescent
carbonation
which
tickled
the
nostrils
the
taste
was
very
dry
and
full
of
aromatic
hop
flavors
though
not
overly
bitter
behind
the
hops
was
a
mild
malt
body
with
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
perfectly
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
fine
carbonation
the
hops
were
present
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
thanks
to
daniel
from
moan
dove
for
recommending
this
one
d
this
is
really
easy
to
put
down
id
drink
it
all
the
time
if
it
were
more
widely
available
and
less
expensive
all
around
good
beer
but
nothing
that
really
strikes
a
fancy
with
me
on
this
one
this
is
easily
drinkable
but
not
something
i
want
all
the
time
only
beacause
there
are
so
many
great
belgian
pales
out
there
and
this
one
is
just
good
not
bad
but
good
advertised
as
extra
hoppy
it
is
anything
but
rather
the
hops
just
serve
to
clean
up
the
sweet
fruity
esters
left
behind
from
the
belgian
style
pour
is
a
murky
golden
the
head
creeps
up
the
bottle
after
popping
very
carbonated
beer
tight
white
belgian
bubbles
nose
of
herbal
straw
pilsner
bitterness
and
a
mild
floral
lavender
quality
taste
is
soap
astringent
quite
dry
on
the
tongue
lavender
comes
through
on
the
palate
quite
nicely
with
a
pislner
earthy
like
finish
wonderful
bitter
light
effervescent
carbonation
that
does
burn
but
adds
to
the
clean
dryness
of
the
beer
very
mild
sweet
some
honey
with
a
finish
of
bread
minty
crisp
on
the
tongue
balance
with
that
too
great
beer
great
for
late
spring
to
summer
so
light
and
well
hopped
it
could
be
had
with

all

a

edit
thinking
back
this
keg
had
been
rolled
down
stairs
into
the
basement
minutes
prior
to
tapping
so
i
wonder
if
that
really
screwed
up
the
taste
by
agitating
all
that
yeast
into
the
beer
drinkability
im
always
happy
to
mix
in
a
lighter
alcohol
brew
particularly
when
its
both
pleasantly
flavorful
and
irresistibly
quaffable
its
good
to
see
the
belgians
can
make
a
great
light
tasty
beer
aswell
some
excellent
dark
strong
brews
cheers
a
pretty
easy
drinking
belgian
aroma
was
enjoyable
as
it
reminded
of
belgian
smells
with
added
hoppiness
it
had
a
nice
fruitiness
to
it
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
and
was
one
which
could
be
sessionable
it
was
pretty
dry
in
the
mouth
and
you
were
left
with
some
resinous
hops
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
pale
pours
a
clouded
yellow
orange
thats
hard
to
see
in
this
dark
light
nose
is
minor
dough
with
spices
mixed
in
milder
than
i
expected
flavor
is
quite
hoppy
it
seems
fair
amount
of
dough
earthy
too
minor
citrus
on
the
backside
decent
level
of
spices
it
seems
buy
really
the
hops
are
in
full
effect
here
smooth

low
carbonation
nice
to

it
started
off
off
to
me
but
soon
got
quite
nice

this

and
even
the
appearance
is
nice
so
actually
its
the
best
when
you
like
beers
that
are
made
by
brewers
that
are
not
crawling
in
front
of
the
market
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
nice
hop
aroma
with
hints
of
spice
and
fruit
strange
combination
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
and
an
ipa
the
absence
of
any
malt
flavor
gave
this
a
funky
aftertaste
feel
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
style
refreshing
body
heavy
carbonation
could
have
another
but
the
bitterness
might
get
to
me
very
good
recommended
golden
body
modest
retaining

and
nottocrisp
on

wonderfully
refreshing
with

the
way
only
belgium
knows
how
something
special
maybe
i
am
the
fool
you
better
watch
this
one
i
got
a
booming

just
minutes
after
finishing
the

grainy

assertive
grassy

moderate

with

lively

feel
refreshing
and
interesting
would
be
a
nice
quaffer
for
a
hot
belgian
day
m
d
feels
great
its
a
shame
im
not
blown
away
with
the
scent
and
flavour
as
this
would
really
top
it
off
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
to
begin
followed
by
a
fairly
slick
and
even
oily
body
which
makes
for
a
smooth
and
easy
finish
before
basically
vaporizing
with
a
bit
of
a
postfinish
dryness
this
may
be
a
case
of
an
offbottle
and
it
may
simply
be
that
i
am
not
too
keen
on
the
hops
used
or
the
method
in
which
this
beer
was
made
id
be
happy
to
try
it
again
to
ensure
i
am
not
throwing
a
perfectly
good
beer
out
the
window
with
this
one
becasue
it
looks
fine
in
the
glass
and
the
feel
is
fabulous
d
there
is
not
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
beer
other
than
the
pungent
bitterness
after
each
sip
the
hops
due
linger
but
there
is
just
no
real
aroma
or
flavor
hops
and
not
much
to
support
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
that
are
there
i
bought
this
bottle
at
beer
mania
in
brussels
the
bottle
i
got
was
labeled
for
import
which
is
where
the
shelton
brothers
url
came
from
big
thanks
to
phyl21ca
for
this
extra
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
lots
of
lees
beige
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
extra
dry
hops
with
lightly
spicy
yeast
taste
is
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
spicy
yeast
with
some
really
dry
hops
not
really
bitter
though
and
good
belgian
style
malt
profile
full
body
with
great
carbonation
well
done
if
maybe
a
tad
too
dry
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
more
often
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
dark
golden
with
an
excellent
creamy
white
head
and
some
sticky
lacing
smells
earthy
with
hops
and
a
bit
of
forest
floor
big
bitterness
from
earthy
and
herbaceous
hops
there
are
some
spice
notes
a
bit
of
creaminess
and
some
smooth
very
slightly
sweet
malt
providing
a
backbone
aftertaste
of
white
pepper
this
is
extraordinarily
flavorful
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
excellent
achievement
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
spicy
and
quite
smooth
even
a
tad
light
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
the
most
flavorful
beer
with
a
lower
abv
ive
had
to
date
a
beer
i
would
have
again
in
a
heartbeat
definitely
put
one
on
the
top
of
your
list
tried
this
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
at
moan
dove
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
into
a
goblet
color
is
a
light
copper
id
call
it
a
shade
or
two
lighter
than
a
typical
pale
ale
very
nice
12
34
head
with
good
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
slightly
floral
with
faint
smell
of
hops
mixed
in
exeptionally
drinkable
beer
although
in
this
case
three
of
us
split
one
bottle
one
i
could
see
having
several
of
over
the
course
of
an
afternoon
with
friends
relatively
low
abv
adds
to
drinkability
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
one
i
will
definitely
try
again
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
unfortunately
the
bottle
i
drank
had
begun
to
skunk
the
dry
finish
is
right
on
and
the
spicy
aromas
and
flavors
complement
the
hops
well
poured
from
capped
and
corked
750ml
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
unlike
the
zinnebier
did
not
have
beer
between
the
cork
and
the
cap
firm
pour
yielded
a
3
finger
head
with
good
staying
pour
and
nice
lacing
beer
was
a
pale
translucent
amber
smell
was
of
slight
hops
straw
and
belgian
yeast
taste
was
slightly
sweet
strawgrassy
flavors
very
light
with
a
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
long
finish
very
easy
drinking
light
and
somewhat
mild

was
a
little
thin
very
nice
33cl
bottle
pours
an
opaque
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
that
lasts
characteristic
sediment
smells
strongly
of
belgian

hops
very
floral
and
somewhat
grassy
light

in
the
background
tastes
floral
with
a
definite
hop
presence
slightly
sweet
grainy
malt
in
the
back
faint
yeasty
spice
for
the
style
and
abv
the
body
is
as
full
as
it
gets
nice
effervescence
crisp
refreshing
plenty
of
flavor
lots
of
character
refined
balanced
etc
etc
fantastic
really
enjoyable
very
impressed
with
this
beer
definitely
will
pick
up
some
more
of
this
when
i
can
this
was
on
tap
for
one
night
only
at
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
murky
and
generally
cloudy
look
to
it
colors
were
a
plain
gold
look
with
a
rather
quick
lacing
the
aromas
were
of
sharp
alcohol
with
some
hops
the
alcohol
was
most
apparent
which
wrapped
around
the
drinks
grassy
aromas
the
taste
definitely
was
grassy
but
it
was
light
enough
to
not
be
overpowering
generally
bitter
taste
solid
body
allowed
it
from
not
being
heavy
or
light
just
right
overall
a
real
treat
why
would
brasserie
de
la
senne
name
a
pale
ale
after
an
obscure
historical
novel
written
by
an
obscure
ukranian
named
nikolai
gogole
who
cares
as
long
as
the
beer
is
delicious
taras
boulba
is
another
hoppy
belgian
that
saison
freaks
owe
it
to
themselves
to
try
overall
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
this
one
out
again
taras
boulba
isnt
awful
but
its
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
not
expecting
the
sulfurskunk
tang
of
it
it
looks
great
and
feels
pretty
good
but
to
me
the
flavor
just
wasnt
good
at
all
i
have
to
wonder
if
the
problem
is
my
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
style
given
the
high
rating
of
this
by
fellow
bas
or
even
maybe
a
light
struck
bottle
i
actually
chose
to
trade
for
this
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
an
nearly
top
shelf
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
must
be
missing
something
though
because
for
me
this
was
not
a
reassuring
introduction
to
the
style
one
beer
that
comes
to
mind
in
comparison
is
green
flashs
pale
ale
that
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
west
coast
pale
that
has
all
the
attributes
of
a
bigger
beer
without
the
actual
huge
taste
and
alcohol
i
like
it
a
lot
and
will
have
it
again
pours
beautifully
with
a
bright
light
gold
body
and
a
pure
white
head
as
thick
as
whipped
cream
but
lighter
aromas
of
fruity
and
floral
hops
perhaps
even
some
higher
aa
varieties
laid
on
a
base
of
light
slightly
biscuity
malts
on
the
palate
things
are
light
and
soft
with
wonderful
integration
among
the
different
flavors
fresh
lemongrass
bitterness
starts
things
off
with
more
herbal
notes
in
the
middle
the
finish
dries
out
in
the
malt
column
but
puts
across
a
pleasant
lemon
note
to
compensate
mouthfeel
is
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
overall
impression
is
one
of
lift
and
deftness
overall
this
is
an
excellent
saisonish
belgian
beer
i
dont
care
much
for
the
herbalmedicinalalkaseltzerish
aftertaste
taste
is
even
more
subdued
it
taste
like
a
belgian
pale
but
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
umphh
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
anything
they
just
got
it
in
at
abes
but
who
knows
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
dry
pretty
on
point
with
all
that
carbonation
i
could
easily
drink
another
but
i
just
found
it
pretty
boring
if
you
are
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
pales
and
its
in
your
price
range
pick
it
up
but
not
highly
recommended
d
quite
drinkable
something
that
would
be
nice
for
23
belgian
ale
is
a
broad
category
but
this
really
drinks
like
one
hell
of
a

oh

worth
the
10
49
no
but
they
got
me
with
the
name
and
the
label
thats
how
they
get
ya
this
beer
is
very
good
probably
one
of
the
best
visual
experiences
it
has
a
very
intriguing
aromatic
character
but
is
not
quite
perfect
and
the
flavor
is
merely
quite
good
the
flavor
seems
a
touch
flat
somehow
this
is
of
course
a
product
of
the
low
alcohol
percentage
but
the
best
of
these
hoppy
low
alcohol
sort
of
season
like
brews
have
more
texture
and
more
exciting
flavors
to
them
than
this
does
still
this
is
very
good
and
i
would
be
quite
happy
to
see
a
bunch
more
beers
in
this
same
vein
i
like
how
easy
drinking
this
beer
is
and
also
how
the
bitterness
while
substantial
is
not
overdone
i
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
and
aromatics
but
that
might
be
made
up
for
by
getting
a
really
fresh
sample
of
this
beer
bought
a
few
bottles
to
take
to
my
tasting
club
for
a
belgian
themed
night
i
admit
i
am
getting
into
belgian
beers
more
and
more
i
really
like
the
belgian
pales
due
to
their
addition
of
hops
because
i
love
ipas
taras
boulba
is
great
because
its
not
too
strong
there
is
not
too
much
belgian
funk
in
this
beer
almost
disappointingly
but
i
can
drink
an
entire
bottle
and
not
be
smashed
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
subtley
bitter
and
build
up
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
almost
fizzy
and
i
like
the
layer
of
foam
after
its
poured
out
an
overall
refreshing
and
hoppy
drinkable
belgian
ale
gold
in
color
cheers
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
given
the
abv
would
make
for
a
good
summer
session
beer
quite
impressive
drinkability
it
was
a
descent
belgian
but
nothing
too
special
overall
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
although
if
they
beefed
up
the
flavours
a
touch
i
think
this
would
be
outstanding
certainly
recommended
though
a

i
would
drink
this
regular
and
convert
many
people
if
this

this
was

i
really
love
the

after

i
did
notice
some

this

poured

the

screams

with
a
noticeable

the
taste
suggested
slight
hints
of
fruitiness
although
the
dry
yet
not
all
out
bitter
hoppiness
is
what
shows
through
in
this
beer
for
me
it
had
a
very
similar
taste
to
a
la
moneuse
i
believe
but
i
could
be
getting
it
mixed
up
with
something
else
either
way
i
have
had
a
beer
that
is
very
similar
to
this
i
found
this
very
refreshing
and
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
on
a
nice
summer
day
such
as
this
one
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
one
i
would
definitely
try
it
its
well
worth
it
absolutely
excellent
hoppy

perfect
appearence
with
a
lasting

tremendously
flavorful
for

well
im
guessing
this
will
keep
well
for
at
least
a
year
nothing
like
an
american
ipa
pure
and
clearly
high
in
quality
fantastic
belgian
ale
cheers
good
new
one
the
feel
is
airy
and
effervescent
juicy
at
first
then
with
the
dry
smack
on
the
back
of
the
palate
it
was
very
easy
to
finish
a
750ml
of
this
very
refreshing
summertime
belgian
imagine
a
hoppier
less
fruity
version
of
zinnebir
and
thats
not
far
off
the
mark
taste
is
light
malty
and
strong
spicy
like
a
combination
of
a
pils
and
a
tripel
light
but
powerfull
and
fullbodied
a
nice
bitterness
which
is
a
litlle
raw
and
herbal
the
yeast
gives
the
beer
a
belgian
spiciness
which
reminds
me
of
coriander
and
anise
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
md
creamy
in
texture
subtle
in
carbonation
and
mediumbodied
this
is
a
very
nicely
flavoured
heavily
hoppy
ale
just
like
what
it
says
on
the
beer
label
extra
hoppy
ale
that
said
with
due
respect
it
lacks
the
kind
of
complexity
that
other
good
belgian
pale
ales
have
and
is
not
as
bitter
as
a
real
bitter
fan
would
satisfyingly
contemplate
extremely
quaffable
and
moreish

also
brought
a
bottle
home
and
saw
it
for
sale
at
a
few
establishments
around
brussels
really
didnt
care
for
this
one
found
it
overcarbed
and
stale
tasting
just
not
for
me
way
too
bready
draught
monks
cafe
it
was
a
lower
lighting
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
big
frothy
offwhite
head
on
it
that
left
some
lacing
it
has
a
nice
nose
a
fairly
good
amount
of
hops
mainly
grapefruit
and
pine
a
little
bit
of
pepperiness
and
yeast
the
taste
is
very
good
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
citrus
and
earthiness
some
pepper
yeast
and
breadiness
nice
well
rounded
and
balanced
flavor
profile
with
belgian
yeast
running
the
show
but
not
being
out
of
hand
a
good
mix
of
fruity
and
spicy
all
while
retaining
a
certain
smoothness
o
good
solid
beer
easydrinking
and
pleasant
flavors
o
really
pleasant
i
enjoy
the
nice
hop
characteristic
in
this
good
balance
of
the
spice
and
hop
a
decent
belgianstyle
ale
that
has
ups
and
downs
resulting
in
a
nice
refreshing
beer
light
easy
to
drink
but
not
that
interesting
mouth
is
med
bod
fairly
creamy
lots
of
carb
4
overall
good
for
the
most
part
but
the
funk
gets
to
you
not
the
kind
of
funk
i
like
in
a
beer
o
quite
belgianlike
well
made
of
great
ingredients
generous
extra
from
a
trade
a
while
back
with
sarge27
enjoyed
from
a
lost
abby
teku
the
bottle
had
some
funk
on
the
to
of
the
bottle
by
the
cork
but
opened
without
incident
brew
poured
a
semi
transparent
orange
with
a
generous
frothy
head
anne
chunky
lacing
nose
is
a
bit
grassy
with
some
fruity
highlights
of
the
apple
pear
family
taste
follows
suit
a
this
one
is
an
earthy
fruity
saison
easy
drinker
with
prickly
carbonation
not
mind
blowing
but
an
enjoyable
beverage
as
the
weather
starts
to
show
signs
of
spring
rich
golden
colored
with
great
clarity
brussels
lacing
a
thin
layer
of
white
foam
barely
covers
the
top
i
smell
pale
malt
and
floral
hops
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
crisply
refreshing
theres
plenty
of
pale
malt
and
floral
hops
in
the
taste
the
belgian
hops
really
kick
in
on
the
fade
onice
golden
ale
or
pale
ale
more
golden
to
me
easy
to
drink
its
just
not
outstanding
falla
a
tad
short
would
have
again
worth
trying
a
really
interesting
brew
in
how
its
belgian
and
also
hoppy
a
crisp
beer
that
offers
medium
flavor
that
makes
it
an
everyday
type
of
beer
devotion
is
seriously
devoted
to
delivering
excellence
in
belgian
flavor
balance
complexity
and
palatability
though
the
ale
seems
effortless
its
painstaking
recipe
formulation
and
brewing
execution
does
not
go
unnoticed
o
a
very
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
but
with
something
to
think
about
i
can
easily
finish
the
bottle
and
could
probably
think
about
having
another
750ml
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
would
appeal
to
a
wide
range
of
beer
lovers
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
style
beer
easy
to
see
how
this
would
be
great
for
summer
light
enough
to
be
thirst
quenching
but
substantial
enough
for
a
bit
of
a
kick
beautiful
body
and
enjoyable
nose
delicious
biscuit
malt
finish
the
dry
hopping
made
it
much
more
hoppier
than
i
anticipated
the
citrus
notes
were
nice
but
the
more
bitter
hoppy
notes
were
not
as
enjoyable
though
i
imagine
thats
what
walking
through
of
field
of
noble
hops
probably
smells
like
yep
bit
confused
by
this
beer
it
promised
a
lot
and
my
issue
is
that
the
flavours
actually
a
bit
insipid
feels
like
theres
a
lot
in
this
beer
but
the
flavour
is
not
felt
in
any
meaningful
way
overall
this
was
actually
a
pretty
disappointing
drop
from
lost
abbey
who
have
genuinely
done
some
of
my
favourite
beers
this
is
reasonably
pedestrian
even
for
a
standard
belgian
pale
while
its
drinkable
it
really
doesnt
bring
anything
interesting
or
exciting
to
the
table
as
a
result
i
cant
really
think
of
when
id
choose
to
drink
it
again
o
im
liking
my
first
lost
abbey
selection
so
far
half
the
bottle
to
go
it
was
not
cheap
at
9
50
but
the
bottle
is
hefty
good
quality
as
is
the
cork
and
cage
capping
although
i
had
to
use
a
corkscrew
to
get
the
cork
out
and
it
swelled
too
much
and
was
too
dense
to
go
back
in
the
bottle
this
sounds
stupid
likely
but
as
soon
as
i
drank
this
i
thought
of
being
back
in
belgium
lost
abbey
nailed
this
one
pours
a
light
copper
color
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
beer
retained
its
head
for
some
time
a
very
yeasty
sweet
smell
hits
you
right
away
along
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
nicely
carbonated
on
a
hot
day
and
it
just
tasted
so
damn
good
another
plus
is
the
6
3
abv
not
overwhelming
like
many
in
this
category
great
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
soild
quilt
of
creamy
tortuous
head
smells
of
grain
yeast
a
little
clove
and
vine
simple
nose
flavor
is
grain
metal
some
botanicals
a
little
yeast
a
little
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
i
like
medium
bodied
with
soft
carb
and
a
wet
finish
i
like
i
would
like
more
in
a
12oz
bottle
for
2
each
ish
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
lower
abv
than
a
lot
of
other
examples
in
the
style
and
very
well
hidden
alcohol
pretty
well
balanced
between
sweetness
bitterness
and
spices
the
taste
is
also
alive
with
citrus
and
pale
malts
notes
somewhat
fruity
sweet
and
a
lingering
finish
a
nice
beer
for
review
1200
o
not
as
much
hop
as
expected
from
reading
and
looking
at
the
label
its
a
unique
flavor
that
combines
some
elements
of
a
blond
and
a
sour
try
if
you
like
cider
the
body
was
very
nice
smooth
and
even
with
a
nicely
dry
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
we
were
wishing
we
had
another
bottle
to
follow
up
with
overall
a
very
nice
brew
certainly
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
overall
wicked
bpa
happy
to
be
enjoying
this
beer
on
draft
on
a
sad
day
hazy
apricot
pour
with
a
small
layer
of
white
head
aroma
of
stone
fruits
light
citrus

taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma
notes
of
peach
apple

essence
of
citrus
grassy
bready
malts
and
yeast
with
a
slight
herbalcitrus
hop
presence
crisp
and
drinkable
about
lightmedium
in

a
more
americanized
version
of
a
bpa
downplaying
the
blatant
yeasty
qualities
a
bit
quite
nice
overall
odpretty
cool
and
not
one
of
their
20
375ml
offerings
which
is
nice
the
brett
wears
on
you
after
a
while
though
o
really
good
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
certainly
one
of
the
better
domestic
interpretations
ive
sampled
on
tap
at
capones
served
in
a
sample
glass
crisp
and
clean
nice
citrus
and
a
bit
of
white
pepper
a
bit
spicy
light
pilsner
malt
subdued
yet
complex
light
and
dry
o
middling
beer
but
drinkable
beer
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
nice
almost
floral
sense
to
it
a
clean
saison
sort
of
beer
with
simple
and
pleasing
flavors
great
finish
id
have
this
again
the
beer
is
hazy
and
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
that
coats
the
glass
in
lacing
the
aroma
offers
funk
yeast
grass
smells
great
nice
and
malty
with
a
refreshing
yeast
character
smooth
feel
on
the
palate
solid
on
tap
pours
a
light
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
earthy
with
a
light
mineral
note
there
is
also
a
bit
of
pear
and
apricot
not
terribly
complex
but
quite
nice
the
taste
is
dry
and
earthy
with
light
pear
and
a
hint
of
green
apple
the
finish
is
dry
and
funky
medium
body
medium
carbonation
solid
beer
o
a
brew
in
the
vein
of
abbey
ales
with
a
nice
california
twist
as
i
drink
this
brew
i
imagine
what
life
would
be
like
living
as
a
monk
simple
peaceful
and
serene
this
beer
is
all
about
the
bringing
a
piece
of
monastery
life
to
busy
california
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
nice
estery
flavor
along
with
some
hop
spice
and
bittering
i
get
floral
notes
a
bit
of
zestiness
and
some
hints
of
cinnamon
too
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
golden
color
with
a
thinnish
bone
white
head
that
slowly
subsides
but
leaves
a
little
stickage
on
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
pomme
fruits
and
caramel
mostly
spicy
almost
peppery
aroma
provides
a
nice
balance
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
spicy
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
pepper
that
was
hinted
in
the
aroma
very
dry
finish
makes
this
one
seem
thin
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
grainy
mouthfeel
decent
belgian
pale
easy
to
drink
but
maybe
a
little
boring
o
a
very
approachable
belgian
pale
some
saison
qualities
as
well
id
order
or
buy
this
again
pours
murky
orange
with
large
white
head
that
stays
around
smells
of
apple
skins
floral
notes
slight
funk
and
honey
tastes
of
apple
skins
slight
funk
honey
tart
and
some
grassiness
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
a
sweet
treat
that
goes
well
in
the
summer
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
ale
here
quite
a
bit
musty
and
funky
nothing
crazy
or
too
out
of
place
but
compared
to
its
belgian
brethren
this
is
just
a
bit
above
average
under
10
bucks
for
a
cork
and
cage
750ml
at
argonaut
on
colfax
pours
a
really
pale
blonde
brassy
color
very
cloudy
with
a
half
inch
white
head
which
fades
to
patchy
foam
on
top
smells
like
subdued
spice
from
belgian
yeast
and
a
lot
of
pale
and
crystal
malt
on
the
lighter
side
less
hops
in
the
nose
than
i
anticipated
flavor
though
is
much
more
hoppy
citrusy
in
profile
and
hitting
up
front
and
in
back
about
the
same
grapefruit
zest
seems
the
closest
but
its
not
quite
that
tart
or
bitter
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
great
big
yeast
flavors
round
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
very
bright
on
the
carbonation
with
a
roughly
medium
body
made
a
bit
heavier
by
the
sediment
suspended
within
overall
this
is
refreshing
and
tasty
but
well
below
the
excitement
i
get
from
most
of
their
other
brews
that
ive
had
still
a
nice
rendition
of
the
style
especially
for
an
american
brew
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
this
is
a
hazy
lightgolden
brew
it
presents
a
bright
white
firm
head
the
aroma
is
pepper
yeast
pale
malt
and
herbalmusty
hops
the
taste
is
balanced
but
maybe
a
slight
tilt
to
the
dry
side
somewhat
tart
a
fruity
citric
acidity
comes
out
in
the
late
tastes
hop
bitterness
is
present
in
the
finish
the
beers
body
is
a
little
lighter
than
expected
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
o
an
excellent
belgian
pale
ale
definitely
at
the
top
of
the
class
overall
this
is
really
crisp
and
clean
and
very
well
balanced
drink
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
found
the
mouth
feel
to
be
a
bit
lacking
for
me
a
bit
too
across
the
board
vs
uniform
and
the
flavor
retention
just
was
a
bit
off
to
me
the
yeast
did
a
good
job
of
tying
things
together
but
left
me
drinking
too
much
water
like
i
said
o
a
very
refreshing
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
liked
this
belgian
pale
from
lost
abbey
not
incredible
but
quite
nice
its
a
little
flat
which
is
a
little
disappointing
but
the
taste
is
nice
ive
heard
about
problems
theyve
had
getting
it
right
it
looks
like
i
have
one
of
those
bottles
but
it
still
tastes
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
lightly
carbonated
good
beer
nothing
exceptional
o
overall
you
need
not
even
close
your
eyes
to
imagine
your
in
belgium
harmonic
yeast
and
grain
combination
creates
a
beautiful
drinking
experience
that
is
effortlessly
smooth
and
polished
from
start
to
finish
the
flavor
really
speaks
of
the
craftsmanship
here
great
brew
are
we
spoiled
on
high
alcohol
beers
they
toned
the
booze
down
and
it
works
wonderfully
very
drinkable
with
enough
complexity
overall
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
still
one
that
tastes
great
and
is
worth
the
price
the
fruit
flavours
work
well
with
the
spiciness
and
the
hops
really
balance
it
out
id
like
to
try
this
on
fresh
on
tap
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
herbal
hops
and
some
slightly
funky
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
tasty
b
pours
a
hazy
orange
hue
with
fluffy
bright
white
head
that
recedes
rather
quickly
honey
suckle
and
apple
on
the
nose
along
with
sweet
belgian
candy
floral
hop
presence
rests
beneath
it
all
slick
body
and
exceptionally
smooth
low
carbonation
tart
apple
and
citric
hop
finish
with
a
very
bready
malt
body
lingering
subtle
sweetness
on
the
lips
of
honey
a
complex
yet
subtle
beer
with
pretty
well
blended
flavors
body
holds
up
nicely
through
the
entire
sip
pretty
good
overall
b
fine
but
would
not
seek
out
again
overall
not
bad
just
not
spectacular
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
note
enjoyable
overall
overall
i
find
this
beer
growing
on
me
its
got
a
definite
green
feel
to
it
and
as
i
said
it
reminds
me
of
spring
i
would
need
to
be
in
the
right
mood
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
o
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
complexity
makes
me
want
to
keep
sipping
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
the
nice
spring
days
like
the
one
we
had
today
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
got
the
proper
elements
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
overall
this
is
another
winner
from
lost
abbey
very
easy
drinking
and
well
crafted
recommended
the
taste
starts
very
crisp
and
lively
with
notes
of
grassy
noble
hops
grannysmith
apple
and
lemon
extreme
effervescence
upfront
quickly
turns
creamy
smooth
opening
up
sweeter
bready
malt
flavors
spice
and
oranges
towards
the
finish
this
ale
gets
drier
and
has
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
bandaid
funk
tartness
to
it
mixing
with
more
lemon
the
crisp
light
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
present
d
very
delightful
beer
and
one
that
is
a
new
favorite
in
my
ever
growing
list
of
belgianbelgianstyle
beers
recommended
to
those
that
like
belgian
pale
ales
a
funky
little
bpa
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
and
i
think
that
works
in
its
favor
the
hop
profile
plays
well
off
the
funk
and
other
flavorsaromas
poured
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
puffy
head
that
lasted
and
left
really
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
like
i
am
drinking
this
at
a
bakery
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
fruit
flavors
apple
maybe
and
slight
zest
and
a
bit
of
citrus
taste
is
a
bit
blander
than
the
aroma
but
really
nice
and
refreshing
hops
hit
first
but
mildly
and
still
bready
and
pretty
rich
for
the
style
mf
comment
i
can
get
some
of
those
fruits
and
yeast
as
well
with
a
grassy
flavor
at
the
end
palate
is
great
soft
and
rich
as
mentioned
so
easy
to
drink
overall
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
like
to
drink
more
often
o
fantastic
beer
the
smell
makes
the
beer
very
enjoyable
this
really
grew
on
me
at
first
i
didnt
think
this
was
anything
special
but
i
noticed
the
complex
flavors
in
the
beer
due
to
the
malt
and
yeast
this
combined
with
the
strong
hop
flavor
won
me
over
the
flavors
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
a
dry
hopped
american
pale
ale
blended
very
well
and
neither
stole
the
show
a
great
twist
on
an
old
world
classic
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
and
left
a
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
typical
there
were
some
grainy
aromas
along
with
some
citrusy
hop
notes
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
bitterness
to
it
that
left
a
sharp
tingle
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
drinkable
good
crisp
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
overall
its
not
a
bad
pale
ale
just
not
one
id
seek
out
again
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
big
rocky
white
head
in
the
aroma
tart
and
lemon
citrus
with
a
small
yeast
presence
too
in
the
taste
dry
yeast
and
lemon
like
tartness
a
small
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
lemon
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
a
small
tartness
and
lemon
citrus
quite
refreshing
and
i
can
dig
it
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
typical
to
belgian
pale
ales
this
is
a
fruity
malty
somewhat
spicy
ale
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
first
time
trying
a
beer
from
the
lost
abbey
and
i
will
probably
be
picking
up
one
of
their
other
styles
at
some
point
this
beer
grew
on
me
after
a
while
id
give
it
another
try
if
i
had
to
sum
this
up
in
two
words
it
would
be
orange
peels
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
great
belgian
ale
would
definitely
buy
again
especially
during
the
summertime
an
easy
drinking
though
unspectacular
belgian
pale
im
loving
devotion
very
complex
for
such
a
simple
beer
with
each
sip
youll
pick
up
new
flavors
and
aromas
that
you
didnt
get
in
the
last
i
wish
i
had
another
750
medium
body
excellent
carbonation
very
smooth
o
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
characteristically
belgian
a
little
thicker
consistency
in
the
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
but
still
very
drinkable
another
solid
brew
from
lost
abbey
overall
a
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
my
first
from
the
lost
abbey
and
i
look
forward
for
more
its
great
to
buy
and
share
with
the
friends
especially
those
wholl
say
beers
come
with
corks
overall
its
a
wonderful
pale
ale
in
general
id
drink
this
just
as
much
as
an
american
pale
ale
be
sure
to
pour
this
slowly
as
the
head
gets
a
little
out
of
control
stay
thirsty
my
friends
m
fantastic
smoothness
on
a
medium
bodied
frame
the
carbonation
is
a
shade
low
for
the
style
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
and
fluffy
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
has
a
subtle
fruity
undertone
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
flavor
is
malty
and
a
little
fruity
with
a
subtle
note
of
butterscotch
and
a
hoppy
undertone
texture
is
fullbodied
edgy
and
a
little
tingly
and
aftertaste
has
malt
hops
and
just
a
teeny
bit
of
tinniness
devotion
indeed
update
tasted
01022011
also
on
tap
has
a
saison
character
but
deteriorated
into
a
bitter
swamp
harsh
and
unforgiving
thin
body
and
sharper
as
you
taste
i
was
too
generous
the
first
rating
o
awesome
beer
i
love
how
different
the
spices
make
it
from
just
about
any
beer
ive
had
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
thick
23
finger
bright
white
head
it
took
a
good
while
for
the
head
to
crawl
back
into
the
body
of
the
beer
leaves
a
decent
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
belgian
yeast
a
mild
form
of
hops
and
scent
of
fresh
bananas
taste
is
spot
on
for
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
enjoy
the
clove
banana
and
small
hint
of
hops
also
catch
a
lot
of
the
yeasty
flavor
mouthful
works
and
and
is
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
good
belgian
pale
not
one
of
my
top
beers
but
would
drink
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
pours
a
murky
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
diminishes
eventually
scent
is
belgian
yeast
with
hints
of
citrus
and
clove
the
scent
seems
to
be
like
im
about
to
dive
into
a
wellbalanced
belgianstyle
pale
scent
is
not
too
misleading
although
not
as
wellbalanced
as
i
was
assuming
the
flavors
are
spot
on
with
the
aroma
lovely
citrus
notes
met
with
hoppy
esters
and
belgian
yeast
hints
of
clove
green
apple
and
banana
cling
to
the
palate
along
with
a
bit
of
bubblegum
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
high
overall
i
feel
this
is
a
solid
example
for
this
style
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
or
for
the
style
but
it
is
definitely
something
i
would
drink
again
o
very
good
belgian
blondepale
ale
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
pours
a
lovely
coppertinged
golden
color
with
ample
white
lacey
head
aroma
is
floral
grapefruit
and
orange
rinds
with
just
a
touch
of
mild
spice
initial
taste
is
surprisingly
good
considering
the
aroma
all
light
hops
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
old
penny
flavor
good
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
effort
o
just
not
a
pleasing
beer
at
all
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
o
not
bad
a
bit
spicy
for
my
liking
but
was
crisp
and
refreshing
after
a
round
of
golf
fuller
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
a
little
creamy
pretty
smooth
on
the
tongue
nice
drinkable
bpa
good
flavor
and
refreshing
on
the
senses
a
little
light
on
aroma
though
othis
is
a
fantastic
mix
between
a
sour
and
belgian
pale
ale
leaning
slightly
more
towards
the
belgian
pale
this
is
a
unique
drink
that
i
really
appreciate
it
goes
down
quite
easily
and
im
amazed
by
the
fair
price
overall
very
pleasant
for
warm
weather
days
well
crafted
but
not
overly
extraordinary
overall
a
nice
summer
beer
its
not
to
much
of
anything
and
seems
well
balanced
nothing
to
crazy
here
i
think
there
are
other
brews
out
there
to
satisfy
me
if
i
would
like
this
one
again
but
at
a
cheaper
price
point
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
lost
abbey
if
the
price
wasnt
so
steep
i
would
stock
up
on
this
beer
for
the
summer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
just
enough
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
cheers
overall
a
very
drinkable
offering
drink
lots
of
carbonation
very
light
body
i
liked
it
and
so
did
the
wife
that
is
rare
in
our
household
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
deep
golden
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
heaps
of
clingy
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
belgian
bready
yeasthoney
and
pungent
floral
hopsit
has
a
medium
bodied
averagely
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
banannabelgian
bready
yeasthoneydew
and
is
rounded
out
with
a
pungent
floral
hop
finish
that
is
quite
dry
and
sweet
and
has
no
bitterness
to
it
at
all
and
for
that
factor
its
quite
an
easy
drinking
brew
thats
quite
sessionable
o
a
nice
stab
at
a
belgian
beer
but
still
lacks
authenticity
devotion
ale
in
the
glass
looks
pale
like
a
belgian
ale
bright
yellow
with
some
lighter
shades
on
the
sides
nice
amount
of
suds
semi
stick
the
nose
is
really
spicy
with
a
certain
yeast
strain
and
it
is
piled
on
with
earthy
aroma
hops
a
tight
biscuit
type
malt
as
well
i
get
alot
of
spice
with
some
small
traces
of
tropic
fruit
reminds
me
of
a
bigger
version
of
redemption
pear
and
apple
with
some
malt
breads
and
a
spicy
finish
feel
is
less
tan
medium
with
an
ok
drinkability
carb
is
no
problem
since
its
on
tap
never
a
problem
in
that
arena
off
the
tap
i
liked
this
but
it
fell
a
bit
short
for
me
overall
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
easy
drinking
and
good
tasting
smell
is
what
stood
out
here
for
me
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
this
is
a
good
one
will
buy
again
aftertaste
is
also
very
good
the
flavor
just
bursts
and
vanishes
a
very
well
done
beer
this
was
my
first
lost
abbey
brew
that
ive
poured
from
a
bottle
and
to
be
honest
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
im
sure
these
guys
make
something
good
i
just
havent
found
it
yet
could
use
a
tad
more
carbonation
to
make
some
flavors
pop
for
a
corked
and
caged
beer
i
was
expecting
alot
more
carbonation
still
very
good
and
worth
trying
jd
note
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
noisy
bar
as
to
what
this
beer
actually
was
it
may
have
been
carnivale
will
check
with
bar
and
move
review
if
incorrect
maybe
something
was
wrong
with
mine
as
i
had
to
use
a
corkscrew
to
remove
the
cork
and
it
looks
like
there
were
pieces
of
cork
glued
to
the
inside
rim
of
the
bottle
i
did
let
mine
warm
up
but
nothing
really
came
through
on
this
beer
i
really
love
lost
abbey
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
d
great
balance
of
malt
yeast
and
hops
making
this
very
sessionable
better
on
tap
then
in
the
bottle
imo
it
drinks
like
its
refreshing
its
thirst
quenching
and
inoffensive
but
for
the
style
can
i
just
have
an
orval
please
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
very
drink
worthy
overall
this
beer
seemed
rather
onedimensional
for
a
belgian
of
any
style
although
there
was
nothing
about
it
that
i
found
disagreeable
not
worth
seeking
out
but
not
worth
avoiding
either
overall
a
solid
drinkable
beer
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
with
little
presence
of
alcohol
and
a
very
refreshing
spiciness
great
for
warmer
months
and
paired
with
fresh
tomato
bruschetta
on
crusty
bread
drinkability
fairly
good
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
but
it
isnt
bad
for
the
style
poured
ontap
at
the
portlost
abbey
brewery
the
beer
presents
in
a
musky
golden
color
with
no
head
no
strong
or
outfront
smells
to
the
beer
but
some
hints
of
malty
notes
the
beer
has
malty
and
fresh
hop
flavors
with
a
finish
more
similar
to
lagers
oddly
enough
the
beer
has
a
mouthfeel
similar
to
a
blonde
round
and
full
in
mouth
the
lageresque
finish
is
very
crisp
and
while
typical
for
a
pale
it
is
very
different
following
the
robust
mouthfeel
3

overall
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
bpa
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
hop
presence
but
light
on
flavor
and
aroma
a
nice
summer
bbq
beer
not
overly
inviting
to
drink
because
of
the
taste
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
bpas
but
this
was
very
well
balanced
di
guess
it
is
balanced
but
the
hop
presence
is
rather
strong
and
i
really
like
dry
finishes
on
my
belgian
ales
the
feel
is
a
little
messy
and
rough
especially
in
the
back
mixing
with
all
the
biting
bitterness
d
the
drinkability
was
very
good
as
i
finished
this
bottle
i
was
left
wanting
more
d
good
as
a
daily
drinker
but
nothing
outstanding
a
very
refreshing
dry
and
grassy
belgian
that
goes
down
very
easy
very
fresh
and
very
hoppy
for
the
style
d
it
drank
pretty
good
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
beer
was
more
like
a
saison
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
imo
appears
a
pale
hazy
orange
colored
body
with
an
off
white
head
which
forms
thick
and
fine
bubbled
i
was
nervous
after
the
decorking
didnt
leave
me
with
much
of
a
pop
aroma
hints
of
funky
yeast
notes
citrus
herbal
tones
pale
malt
derivatives
a
nice
version
of
a
bpa
fruity
undertones
with
funky
yeast
profile
and
hops
equals
perfection
when
done
right
flavor
brings
out
a
bit
of
band
aidhorse
blanket
funkiness
once
the
yeast
is
poured
in
but
more
citric
herbal
hops
with
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
pale
malt
sweetness
equates
to
a
good
time
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
with
carbonation
medium
bodied
finish
is
a
bit
plasticband
aid
just
a
touch
but
not
enough
to
offend
it
actually
works
with
the
other
flavors
going
on
drinkability
overall
is
effortless
the
6
range
is
working
for
these
bottle
conditioned
ales
i
wish
more
came
in
this
packaging
i
could
finish
this
bottle
off
with
myself
without
a
problem
excellent
american
belgian
paleblonde
ale
d
a
fairly
average
and
unremarkable
belgian
pale
ale
however
that
doesnt
keep
it
from
having
solid
drinkability
its
far
from
the
cream
of
the
crop
for
the
style
but
a
solid
offering
none
the
less
overall
a
nice
little
surprise
from
lost
abbey
after
600
reviews
i
really
should
know
by
now
that
you
cant
judge
by
other
peoples
opinions
this
beer
is
very
good
makes
for
a
decent
representative
of
the
variety
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
decent
flavors
and
relatively
low
alcohol
a
little
more
carbonation
would
help
things
out
a
little
bit
here
decent
beer
but
a
little
expensive
for
what
you
end
up
with
not
particularly
impressed
and
i
will
pass
on
buying
this
again
tasty
m
d
soft
and
well
carbonated
delicious
and
very
well
crafted
beer
extremely
drinkable
d
very
nice
bpa
and
quite
the
enjoyable
drink
ill
have
to
grab
another
bottle
and
toss
some
pairings
at
this
soon
this
is
a
very
drinkable
well
balanced
beer
it
is
a
great
session
beer
as
well
as
a
great
summer
beer
another
outstanding
beer
by
the
lost
abbey
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
easy
to
drink
without
going
overboard
on
the
belgian
yeast
phenolics
allowing
some
hop
flavor
through
the
tettanger
hops
had
a
slightly
sharp
and
interesting
herbal
flavor
in
addition
to
the
spicy
citrus
background
theres
a
smooth
grain
and
bread
flavor
with
hint
of
subtle
belgian
fruit
esters
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
flavor
can
seem
a
touch
muted
at
times
i
suppose
this
is
on
the

side
of

but

very

check
this
beer
out
d
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
low
alcohol
content
and
good
flavors
make
it
a
sessionable
beer
particularly
one
well
suited
for
the
warmer
months
d
really
interesting
beer
and
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
refreshing
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
uniquely
subtle
finish
to
this
very
broad
and
all
too
often
samey
beer
style
we
could
ourselves
imagine
sitting
at
an
outside
café
drinking
this
one
with
a
plate
of
cheese
and
rustic
bread
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
not
trying
to
be
a
light
tripel
rather
a
fruitier
and
cleaner
alternative
as
much
as
i
like
the
burst
of
phenols
and
yeast
you
find
in
many
pale
belgian
beers
this
one
is
a
different
alternative

comments
this
is
my
first
from
lost
abbey
a
good
beer
overall
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
highly
regarded
craft
brewery
as
this
beer
warmed
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
began
to
see
some
of
its
subtle
complexities
overall
good
belgium
pale
not
what
i
expected
from
lost
abbey
not
my
favorite
of
their
lineup
drinkable
but
forgetable
feel
is
moderate
to
full
with
the
same
citric
flash
on
the
finish
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
would
likely
benefit
from
firmer
carbonation
to
bring
the
yeast
notes
out
a
bit
more
drinks
a
bit
like
a
spiced
wheat
ale
as
the
yeast
notes
are
largely
non
participatory
this
is
quite
drinkable
it
drinks
lightly
in
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
but
is
also
nicely
spicedlike
a
good
saison
it
is
not
static
and
keeps
mixing
up
the
taste
sensations
as
one
drinks
which
is
good
in
a
beer
well
however
one
wants
to
classify
it
is
drinking
nicely
and
by
now
i
have
finished
the
bottle
with
no
complaints
tasted
from
750ml
bottle
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
lace
yeasty
nose
with
orange
peel
and
some
clove
and
vanilla
flavors
on
the
palate
are
similar
but
much
more
bitter
as
expected
the
carbonation
is
very
high
and
the
body
is
fairly
light
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
d
had
this
with
a
salad
and
a
sandwich
and
it
was
perfect
great
for
meals
and
im
sure
great
to
just
sit
and
think
about
the
drink
a
thin
cap
of
white
head
over
orange
hues
aromas
are
mostly
of
citrus
and
grain
very
airy
and
refreshing
on
the
nose
flavors
are
very
funky
with
almost
a
bit
of
mustiness
and
farm
lightly
bitter
orange
zest
topped
off
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
light
body
and
heavy
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
indeed
refreshing
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
definitely
drawing
influence
from
a
lot
of
my
favorite
classic
beers
orval
and
popperings
hommel
to
name
a
few
it
pours
murky
hazy
burntgold
with
a
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
only
reason
it
doesnt
get
a
five
is
because
i
have
a
5
aversion
and
the
head
doesnt
pillowchunk
up
like
some
of
the
beers
that
spawned
its
inspiration
nose
is
honey
a
touch
of
biscuitbread
grass
flower
apple
pear
lemonlemongrass
caramel
it
just
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
and
brings
up
images
in
my
mind
of
a
place
that
is
a
kind
of
heaven
on
earth
with
a
small
to
moderate
white
head
some
light
hoppiness
on
the
nose
almost
like
a
nicely
brewed
tripel
could
also
taste
coriander
and
lemon
zest
mouthfeel
was
more
like
a
pale
ale

to
for

its
just
okay
id
probably
take
a
fin

over
this
most
days
and
i
can
get
that
easily
at
the
local
super
market
a
good
beer
not
great
i
love
the
whole
line
from
this
brewery
this
one
however
is
good

while
i
enjoyed
that
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
i
will
stick
with
ddc
dernière
volonté
when
i
feel
in
need
of
an
hoppy
belgian
ale
strange
brew
here
not
what
i
was
expecting
no
nose
to
speak
of
at
first
whiff
but
it
might
be
a
tad
cold
poured
piss
clear
into
a
large
piraat
snifter
taste
was
a
bit
shocking
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
roundness
and
yeast
pils
and
hops
hit
me
hard
hops
galore
here
with
grapefruit
pith
and
other
bitter
notes
warming
up
now
much
much
better
sweetness
coming
through
with
some
nice
spice
and
soft
citrus
this
is
definitely
an
american
interpretation
of
the
the
style
and
i
like
it
i
cant
quite
categorize
it
in
my
mind
yet
i
strongly
urge
anybody
tasting
this
beer
to
temper
it
properly
the
subtle
notes
that
show
off
the
brewers
art
cannot
possibly
be
appreciated
otherwise
im
liking
this
beer
more
and
more
i
want
my

my

it

the

lightly

i
anticipated
an
easy
drinker
the
flavor
is
on

subtle
side

very

the
taste
doesnt
get
much
of
a
boost
from
the
mouth
light
hoppy
citrus

a
delicate

in

understated
with

drink
this

this

so
far
it
is
the
least

ive
had
from

overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
from
lost
abbey
i
have
been
slowly
working
my
way
through
their
lineup
and
to
be
honest
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
it
was
so
right
up
my
alley
that
its
not
even
funny
such
a
great
light
profile
and
rich
flavors
i
am
not
sure
how
i
could
have
not
found
this
one
earlier
this
was
just
simply
excellent
and
i
really
need
to
get
more
of
it

was

the

was

good

well
the
taste
was
disappointing
in
that
i
have
high

for

this

if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
i
think
you
should
i
enjoyed
this
but
to
be
honest
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
to
save
it
for
another
day
it
did
seem
that
the
flavor
got
a
bit
better
as
the
beer
went
along
but
still
pretty
mild
overall
a
good
get
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
is
a
very
nice

its
incongruous
and
creates
a
biting
acerbic
quality
that
is
alarming
somehow
the
beer
recovers
the
smacks
sups
long
and
pleasant
as
almond
skins
warm
toast
and
graham
cracker
caress
the
palate
long
after
the
fact
further
down
the
bottle
lost
abbeys
mineral
yeast
signature
brighten
up
and
give
the
beer
a
little
break
with
a
long
breath
wonderful
carbonation
and
delightful
quaffable
heft
were
it
not
for
the
disconcerting
and
marked
styrofoam
this
would
be
a
more
heralded
specimen
cheers
the
taste
is
complex
lots
of
funk
with
peppery
notes
a
very
pronounced
hop
bitterness
some
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sourness
it
has
a
medium
body
and
the
carbonation
is
also
medium
it
finishes
bitter
and
that
dominates
the
aftertaste
this
son
of
a
gun
overall
is
very
bitter
bitter
in
a
way
that
say
la
folie
is
sour
it
just
dominates
my
taste
buds
and
almost
becomes
one
dimensional
but
i
just
cant
help
taking
further
sips
good
drinkability
here
more
than
good
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
de
ranke
xxx
only
with
more
bitterness
its
like
im
drinking
hop
juice
i
kid
you
not
some
may
think
this
goes
over
the
top
and
i
could
understand
where
they
are
coming
from
for
me
its
a
hoppy
delight
though
it
should
be
consumed
in
moderation
lest
your
taste
buds
be
overwhelmed
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
you
wished
i
favour
it
and
recommend
it
only
those
adventurous
need
apply
highly
drinkable
seems
pretty
simple
but
very
very
good
not
much
belgian
character
imo
but
i
really
didnt
care
based
on
the
taste
highly
recommended
especially
for
warmer
weather
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
very
refreshing
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
these
guys
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
lightly
spiced
and
semidry
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
1
white
head
above
the
bubbly
clear
golden
brew
head
maintains
for
quite
some
time
with
spotty
but
resilient
lace
aroma
is
lightly
of
malts
and
spices
with
the
flavor
replicating
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
this
one
seems
to
be
more
saison
than
belgianstyle
pale
ale
but
regardless
a
crisp
brew
that
makes
me
want
tp
keep
finding
my
glass
full
finished
the
bomber
myself
at
lunch
i
was
tempted
by
the
relatively
lower
abv
it
was
a
good
pale
belgian
and
unique
very
clear
pour
color
is
pale
orange
and
very
clean
no
haze
at
all
aroma
is
light
and
floral
with
a
touch
of
citrus
flavor
is
a
very
smooth
with
a
really
clean
aftertaste
of
green
applehoneywheatmalt
low
in
alcohol
and
very
easy
on
the
tongue
this
bottle
came
straight
from
the
brewery
so
it
was
pretty
fresh
nice
golden
color
hazy
with
a
somewhat
funky
aroma
the
taste
was
clean
a
little
funk
some
tart
fruity
flavors
also
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
i
was
glad
my
cousin
popped
this
bottle
because
it
wasnt
on
tap
at
the
brewery
d
this
is
very
drinkable
in
that
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
isnt
one
id
have
more
than
once
if
there
were
other
choices
last
swigs
reminds
me
a
tad
of
orval
without
the
funk
quite
impressive
for
an
american
brewery
to
create
such
a
spot
on
belgian
kudos
to
lost
abeey
d
light
and
smooth
belgian
ale
that
is
surprisingly
hoppy
for
the
style
but
not
for
the
socal
location
like
most
all
of
lost
abbey
offerings
this
is
a
very
solid
and
worthy
offering
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
the
stronger
styles
but
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
belgian
offering
that
is
not
too
overwhelming
in
terms
of
abv
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
the
one
pint
was
definitely
not
enough
pours
a
rich
clear
golden
with
slight
orange
tint
and
an
airy
spider
weblike
head
at
a
fairly
cold
temp
earthy
hops
in
smell
some
pale
malt
breadiness
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
earthy
hops
maybe
a
lot
of
that
earthiness
is
from
the
3
yeast
blend
the
taste
also
come
across
mineraly
though
when
it
warms
up
substantially
that
mineral
character
goes
away
and
you
get
a
lot
of
sweetness
with
no
bitterness
i
liked
this
a
little
more
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
as
that
is
probably
a
bit
fresher
but
this
3
month
old
bottle
isnt
too
shabby
at
all
minerally
mouthfeel
in
a
very
good
way
thought
provoking
even
at
this
abv
highly
digestible
balanced
beautiful
i
can
only
think
of
a
couple
american
breweries
that
consistently
impress
me
with
their
belgian
inspired
brews
russian
river
ommegang
allagash
and
lost
abbey
is
certainly
making
a
name
for
themselves
in
my
book
upon
the
swallow
your
mouth
is
left
with
the
memory
of
the
bitter
grapefruit
peel
hops
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
another
excellent
beer
from
lost
abbey
drinkability
think
this
one
should
be
labeled
under
the
belgian
ipa
category
a
bit
too
much
hops
for
me
but
otherwise
drinkable
and
fairly
interesting
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
that
devotion
would
be
good
beer
i
just
didnt
think
it
would
be
quite
this
good
its
still
waaay
too
early
to
say
for
sure
let
me
drink
the
handful
of
port
offerings
that
are
biding
their
time
in
my
cellar
first
but
this
brewery
has
a
chance
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
sources
for
belgianstyle
beer
in
this
country
there
was
a
forceful
pop
when
i
pulled
the
cork
but
no
foaming
the
beer
was
a
hazy
light
amber
colour
with
a
full
offwhite
head
of
foam
good
retention
and
lots
of
fine
bubbles
clung
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mild
overall
but
more
complex
than
i
initially
thought
particularly
as
it
warmed
hints
of
malty
caramel
and
pears
gave
way
to
a
pleasing
vanilla
aroma
lemony
citrus
and
earthy
apple
skins
yeast
character
was
very
subdued
taking
a
backseat
to
the
fruitiness
the
flavour
emphasized
bready
malt
along
with
a
fresh
grassy
hop
bitterness
that
rounded
out
the
finish
hints
of
fruit
lemon
zest
and
mild
spice
played
in
the
background
just
the
slightest
bit
of
warmth
followed
the
beer
which
was
just
offdry
on
the
palate
mediumlight
bodied
the
texture
was
a
mix
of
creaminess
and
lively
carbonation
an
excellent
beer
overall
highly
drinkable
with
complexities
that
were
only
apparent
if
you
went
looking
for
them
if
you
have
an
opportunity
definitely
try
it
nice
looking
beer
that
poured
golden
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
stuck
around
some
clumpy
lacing
the
smell
was
less
impressive
somewhat
light
there
was
a
light
graininess
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
the
barest
whiff
of
banana
and
orange
the
beer
is
surprisingly
tasteless
somewhat
similar
to
the
smell
with
floral
hops
and
light
graininess
up
front
followed
by
some
light
fruit
the
flavors
are
a
little
brighter
than
the
smell
but
lack
an
edge
curiously
bland
mouthfeel
is
a
little
better
and
the
beer
is
smooth
and
relatively
light
bodied
it
lacks
a
creaminess
that
would
have
been
a
nice
touch
im
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
beer
but
ive
liked
the
other
lost
abbey
beers
ive
had
d
a
great
drinking
beer
with
a
simple
hoppy
and
herbal
character
another
great
one
from
the
lost
abbey
very
rustic
a
great
thirst
quencher
belgian
bomber
caged
and
corked
and
wo
frashness
or
bottling
info
pours
light
hazy
apricot
under
an
off
white
head
initially
showing
puffy
retention
then
softening
to
a
thin
tiny
bubble
film
this
one
leaves
nice
tiny
bubble
webs
of
lacing
tropical
fruit
nose
melons
honey
bananas
another
highly
enjoyable
lost
abbey
offering
more
tropical
fruits
white
pepper
honey
yeasty
spice
some
light
earthy
mustyness
and
then
a
dry
subtle
hoppy
finish
one
of
my
seamingly
many
favorite
styles
and
this
one
nails
it
bring
on
the
salads
cheese
shell
fish
crusty
bread
or
just
about
whatever
type
of
food
you
want
and
enjoy
it
with
this
high
quality
brew
only
wish
i
could
get
anything
this
good
around
here
lucky
san
marcosians
it
is
the
4th
of
july
and
even
though
it
was
a
not
so
nice
day
outside
i
made
it
better
by
drinking
this
beer
pours
great
with
a
nice
head
great
golden
color
and
awesome
texture
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
has
many
flavors
and
the
mouth
feel
is
great
made
my
day
much
better
the
beer
is
fine
but
i
cant
say
i
was
overly
impressesd
its
qutie
drinkable
and
i
guess
could
pass
as
a
belgium
pale
ale
a
decent
beer
but
just
not
all
that
great
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
offerings
i
sampled
from
port
brewing
not
a
lot
of
hubbub
going
on
in
this
brew
i
was
hoping
for
more
hops
alcohol
and
funk
the
bitterness
lingers
almost
to
the
point
of
being
a
detraction
without
more
hop
flavor
or
funk
to
back
it
up
drinkability
i
find
this
one
to
be
fairly
refreshing
myself
overall
i
would
like
this
beer
more
if
it
didnt
have
that
off
flavor
i
have
had
it
before
and
i
know
that
it
is
not
just
from
a
bad
bottle
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
homebrews
that
didnt
got
possibly
slightly
contaminated
opening
smell
is
light
spicy
and
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
nose
good
but
not
spectacular
something
a
bit
sour
or
off
with
it
which
shows
up
in
the
taste
malty
beer
with
a
winey
oily
belgian
feel
a
bit
heavy
and
full
of
spice
from
the
hop
but
out
of
balance
for
me
the
two
didnt
match
very
well
for
me
even
a
bit
grassy
or
overwhelming
in
the
hop
on
the
back
that
rumor
is
that
some
of
the
monks
love
hops
hints
at
a
hoppy
version
of
the
belgian
single
but
this
doesnt
work
for
me
good
beer
well
made
just
missed
the
mark
a
bit
this
is
certainly
pleasurable
to
drink
to
my
tongue
this
is
a
nice
esb
in
a
big
belgian
ale
bottle
notes
a
beer
on
its
own
island
this
doesnt
reflect
the
norm
of
belgian
pale
and
it
teeters
on
becoming
lagerish
in
smell
and
taste
spices
pull
it
together
just
ok
for
me
definietly
a
belgian
ipa
worth
getting
i
also
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
there
was
a
1
bottle
limit
when
i
made
my
purchase
arg
highly
recommended
another
good
brew
from
lost
abbey
d
highly
sessionable
beer
very
nice
with
good
balance
would
go
well
with
chinese
food
i
think
d
i
think
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
wish
i
would
of
got
more
than
2
of
this
i
think
it
should
be
under
belgian
ipa
and
not
belgian
pale
notes
i
was
told
this
was
a
brew
that
was
specially
brewed
for
the
monks
cafe
back
east
also
its
being
dryhopped
right
now
and
wont
be
available
in
bottles
until
midmay
very
dry
plenty
of
hop
flavor
distinct
brett
aroma
eh
o
a
great
example
of
a
wellmade
brett
beer
i
really
want
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
since
i
could
see
the
particular
brett
character
working
well
with
the
hops
alas
the
bottle
was
this
old
when
i
found
it
on
the
shelf
hasnt
developed
poorly
in
the
bottle
since
the
brett
was
able
to
let
go
over
time
but
the
hops
sure
have
faded
to
almost
nothing
overall
excellent
excellent
excellent
the
brett
really
makes
this
pale
ale
shine
perhaps
more
similar
to
a
farmhouse
saison
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
nonetheless
it
is
incredible
reminds
me
a
bit
of
orval
just
not
as
complex
and
intense
i
just
wish
could
get
my
hands
on
more

a

overall
a
wonderful
beer
must
try
kind
of
the
opposite
experience
to
what
i
had
with
russian
rivers
temptation
smelled
tart
tasted
sweet
not
bad
either
way
but
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
cleansing
tang
or
something
on
the
palate
m
very
carbonated

overall
this
was
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
and
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
considering
its
a
funky
brew
the
fruity
sweetness
and
floral
hop
additions
to
me
allowed
this
to
go
down
easy
it
was
a
very
hot
and
humid
day
today
this
beer
was
quenching
tasty
and
hit
the
spot
perfectly
d
outstanding
drinkability
abv
is
spot
on
the
complexity
keeps
it
interesting
and
yet
it
all
holds
together
extremely
well
i
cannot
wait
to
try
another
from
the
lost
abbey
mf
smooth
light

with
a
dry

almost
no
aftertaste
4
5
o
a
memorable
beer
due
to
the
addition
of
brett
drinks
like
a
saison
o
an
absolutely
great
belgian
pale
ale
i
wish
la
would
produce
more
of
this
one
like
in
6
packs
one
can
dream
o
this
one
was
fun
the
aromas
blew
me
away
but
you
could
tell
every
part
was
beautifully
and
meticulously
crafted
my
beer
guy
suggested
i
try
this
as
a
bridge
into
saisons
long
story
short
now
im
into
saisons
overall
one
of
the
better
attempts
at
the
style
ive
tried
o
a
very
nice
brett
beer
its
everything
brux
and
nb
brett
beer
should
have
been
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
the
lost
abbey
and
for
the
price
5
50
probably
their
best
bargain
if
youre
patient
enough
to
lay
it
down
for
quite
some
time
i
do
think
the
brett
could
produce
an
even
more
flavorful
beer
than
this
one
here
as
indicated
by
the
wonderful
aroma
but
its
overall
a
tasty
and
good
clean
take
on
the
style
o
overall
this
was
a
very
well
executed
beer
think
this
is
right
around
its
peak
as
ive
had
older
brett
saisons
from
lost
abbey
and
after
2
years
things
begin
to
fall
off
fast
o
nice
brett
saison
belgian
pale
i
could
go
for
more
esters
on
my
saisons
but
this
one
is
certainly
a
quality
brew
another
nice
selection
from
the
lost
abbey
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
and
slightly
funky
beer
probably
priced
a
bit
higher
than
its
worth
but
otherwise
worth
a
try
43

o
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
examples
out
there
it
looks
and
smells
the
part
but
disappoints
thereafter
saints
devotion
ale
lost
abbey
taste
is
a
dry
floral
mild
yeasty
mustiness
barn
hay
but
restrained
tart
wild
apple
then
a
yeasty
finish
that
goes
on
and
on
with
a
bit
of
a
prickle
fair
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
coating
tart
prickle
but
a
light
enough
body
that
is
really
drinkable
the
nose
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
you
get
a
bigger
hit
of
the
floral
brett
character
the
sourness
is
restrained
on
this
but
it
balances
sessionability
and
some
nice
brett
character
recommended

overall
its
really
quite
drinkable
but
it
promised
more
than
it
ultimately
delivered
i
still
like
it
a
lot
but
i
was
expecting
a
new
favourite
from
lost
abbey
looking
at
it
and
so
im
a
little
bit
sore
that
it
didnt
live
up
to
its
potential
pours
a
dirty
light
mandarin
hue
with
the
frothiest
three
finger
head
just
like
mr
whippy
and
clingy
lacing
everywhereon
smell
its
typical
funky
brettmangoesfresh
fruit
salad
and
a
nice
barnhouse
funkiness
that
lets
you
know
its
a
saisonthe
feel
is
just
under
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
and
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
fuller
feel
and
the
taste
is
nice
but
nothing
im
gonna
rave
on
about
tomorrow
its
bubblegumfunky
bretthoney
and
finished
with
a
lemon
herbal
hoppiness
and
overall
out
of
all
of
their
range
this
is
the
most
normalmest
and
borinest
and
even
though
its
very
sessionable
i
wont
be
back
for
seconds
cheers
flavors
are
a
little
one
note
though
base
beer
perhaps
lacks
a
little
complexity
some
light
breadiness
and
very
faint
hint
of
fruit
on
the
finish
but
the
flavor
profile
is
dominated
by
the
brett
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
the
brett
just
fine
just
seems
like
it
could
have
more
there
to
compliment
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
right
on
nice
enough
medium
body
and
very
over
carbonated
taking
away
from
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
lots
of
dry
musty
funk
with
the
brett
overpowering
almost
everything
enjoyable
about
the
base
beer
nice
to
have
a
little
of
this
complimenting
the
farmhouse
yeast
but
its
way
too
strong
for
my
liking
decent
amount
of
breadyeast
flavor
underneath
along
with
grass
straw
faint
peppery
spice
and
light
fruit
once
the
palate
adjusts
to
strong
brett
presence
the
yeast
spice
apple
pear
and
alcohol
flavors
come
out
not
a
bad
beer
but
overcarbed
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
o
nice
beer
would
be
especially
thirst
quenching
on
a
super
hot
day
i
am
interested
to
see
how
time
will
treat
this
one
o
appearance
and
smell
are
great
unfortunately
my
bottle
was
undercarbonated
this
gave
the
effect
of
drinking
a
watereddown
beer
that
accentuates
the
bittering
hops
too
much
id
up
the
carbonation
by
at
least
25
and
provide
more
body
to
the
beer
so
it
doesnt
taste
so
light
additionally
id
up
the
funkiness
of
a
beer
advertised
to
be
brett
fermented
overall
decent
beer
that
lacks
the
depth
i
was
expecting
i
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
would
age
d
this
is
a
really
nice
complex
beer
both
with
its
aromas
and
palate
again
big
thanks
to
kevsal
for
sending
this
back
as
my
welcome
back
to
the
states
box
oa
good
beer
but
the
flavors
didnt
mesh
perfectly
and
the
mustyness
could
have
been
improved
upon
o
overall
a
decent
belgian
ale
with
a
more
fuller
flavor
profile
than
a
saison
the
brett
adds
a
tinge
of
tart
sourness
to
the
complexity
overall
quite
enjoyable
m
lighter
side
of
medium
high
carb
helps
with
that
overall
a
different
take
on
a
belgian
pale
theres
an
almost
herbal
quality
i
cant
pin
down
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
outstanding
still
an
enjoyable
spring
beer
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
and
its
got
some
good
elements
but
the
overcarbonation
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
enjoy
it
and
often
makes
it
difficult
to
even
find
the
good
hidden
behind
that
wall
of
fuzz
light
body
and
well
carbonated
pretty
refreshing
though
with
how
drying
the
beer
is
on
the
tongue
it
makes
me
a
bit
thirsty
o
great
brew
from
them
boys
over
at
the
lost
abbey
cant
go
wrong
with
their
stuff
again
being
reminded
right
here
right
now
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
funky
belgian
pale
to
me
it
reminds
me
of
a
funky
saison
from
the
brett
but
bitterness
gets
me
back
on
style
fruitiness
is
nice
but
bitterness
and
funk
seem
to
fight
a
bit
for
me
but
not
bad
at
all
actually
really
good
just
not
expecting
it
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
definitely
will
buy
again
o
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
brett
golden
ale
defintley
enjoyable
would
drink
again
overall
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
for
me
it
just
rubs
me
the
right
way
great
stuff
o
my
favorite
brett
beer
so
far
good
for
a
newcomer
to
funky
beers
overall
hmm
i
like
it
i
guess
nothing
standout
but
a
great
neutral
delivery
of
a
6
abv
jd
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
massive
white
foam
on
top
the
retention
and
head
are
strong
on
this
are
strong
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
brett
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
more
like
a
saison
to
me
than
a
pale
ale
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
spicy
side
the
malt
is
good
there
is
a
subtle
bitterness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
its
a
good
brew
in
my
opinion
with
more
flavor
and
less
strength
of
dryness
this
beer
would
flourish
poured
into
a
lost
abbey
rastal
san
marco
glass
pours
a
quite
hazy
medium
golden
amber
with
a
massive
half
glass
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
leaving
heavy
pillowy
lacing
aroma
of
bready
malt
slight
dry
white
wine
hints
of
clove
and
slight
wild
yeast
and
funk
so
far
the
funk
level
is
just
right
flavor
is
much
more
funky
barnyard
up
front
with
moderate
brett
developing
unusual
sweet
dry
malt
lemon
citrus
slightly
floral
and
vinous
finishes
with
dry
brett
and
light
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
but
nice
mouthfeel
from
active
carbonation
i
never
know
what
to
expect
from
brett
influenced
belgian
and
saison
type
beers
im
not
a
fan
of
intense
funkiness
wild
yeast
nor
sourness
this
ale
has
a
distinct
funkiness
but
all
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
and
lightly
influential
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
lighter
than
expected
but
well
made
and
enjoyable
o
this
is
quite
nice
not
to
mention
finally
a
lost
abbey
beer
in
the
small
375ml
bottles
that
does
not
cost
17
a
bottle
the
brett
is
nice
and
dry
without
being
medicinal
and
the
citrus
really
livens
this
up
a
welcome
sight
with
the
weather
improving
overall
i
was
really
intrigued
by
the
nose
i
thought
it
was
going
to
like
lost
abbeys
answer
to
rayon
vert
by
green
flash
but
it
just
falls
flat
no
malt
backbone
whatsoever
so
it
is
very
unbalanced
all
you
get
is
funkiness
from
the
yeast
and
a
hoppiness
that
is
way
too
sharp
and
bitter
for
the
style
im
pretty
let
down
by
this
beer
i
as
came
in
with
high
expectations
but
this
beer
certainly
didnt
come
close
to
meeting
them
definitely
stick
with
rayon
vert
for
an
interesting
american
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
hit
with
brettanomyces
hell
raul
is
tired
of
this
doggone
review
do
not
get
this
flavors
of
sage
rosemary
light
black
pepper
bitter
fruit
rind
coriander
crystal
malt
grassy
hops
funky
yeast
overall
refreshing
and
challenging
compelling
but
not
the
easiest
to
drink
its
like
a
strong
barnyard
saison
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
brett
brewed
saison
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
sitting
outside
because
it
only
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
o
not
the
best
beer
from
lost
abbey
coming
from
a
la
fanboy
and
not
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
but
this
is
a
good
beer
the
brett
is
a
nice
addition
and
the
sweet
citrus
really
make
this
a
nice
tasting
refreshing
beer
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
mostly
because
it
was
only
5
49
and
it
had
brettanomyces
the
cork
made
a
huge
pop
when
it
left
the
bottle
and
then
foam
began
creeping
out
of
the
bottle
neck
appearance
is
orange
and
super
hazy
cloudy
scant
bubbles
at
the
top
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
brett
sort
of
sharp
and
a
slight
bit
of
that
telltale
funk
stink
flavor
is
brett
bit
of
hay
citrus
lemon
touch
of
aspirin
this
is
a
solid
enjyable
beer
i
almost
wish
it
was
a
10
750
id
probably
buy
a
couple
also
lost
abbey
might
as
well
just
drop
devotion
in
favor
of
this
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
since
it
seemed
to
have
the
perfect
amount
of
brett
to
complement
the
aroma
and
taste
a
very
simple
belgian
pale
ale
with
an
added
touch
of
brett
nice
beer
but
nothing
over
the
top
id
like
to
sit
on
one
for
24
months
to
see
how
this
brett
changes
the
beer
pours
a
glowy
golden
orange
quite
cloudy
i
avoided
pouring
some
chunks
into
my
glass
but
there
are
lots
of
floaties
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
very
large
puffy
white
head
hard
to
keep
it
under
control
during
the
pour
the
aroma
has
a
big
dose
of
soft
funk
on
top
of
fresh
grain
very
pleasant
it
smells
like
a
tropical
fruit
barnyard
flowers
leather
mangoes
mushrooms
and
earth
wonderful
brett
notes
very
mild
medicinal
character
seemed
a
bit
strong
at
first
but
it
settled
into
the
rest
of
the
beer
after
a
minute
the
taste
starts
with
fruity
grain
sweetness
before
drying
out
with
funk
and
adding
a
touch
of
lemony
tartness
lots
of
funky
fruity
brett
flavor
mushrooms
lemons
barnyard
i
try
not
to
avoid
esoteric
notes
but
it
sorta
tastes
like
unripe
kiwi
finishes
quite
dry
with
medium
to
mild
bitterness
grassy
hops
effervescent
mouthfeel
at
first
definitely
reminds
me
of
other
brett
beers
personally
i
prefer
it
with
a
bit
less
gas
and
the
carbonation
fades
quite
quickly
pretty
smooth
feel
after
a
minute
actually
otherwise
its
light
but
full
on
the
palate
very
well
suited
to
the
beer
and
style
no
booze
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
wonderful
balance
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
i
would
drink
be
happy
to
drink
regularly
surprisingly
good
price
too
particularly
compared
to
most
recent
tla
bottles
anyway
im
quite
impressed
by
this
one
great
beer
sensational
beer
i
was
never
amazed
with
the
regular
devotion
but
with
the
brett
addition
here
the
beer
is
entirely
transformed
the
pour
is
thick
and
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
an
inch
of
white
head
and
amazing
lacing
the
nose
is
funky
from
the
brett
not
sour
at
all
but
somehow
very
wild
and
farmy
summery
harvest
time
i
dont
know
its
fresh
and
its
old
world
pale
malted
barley
and
wheat
malt
and
a
decent
hopping
more
than
i
remember
in
the
regular
devotion
the
brett
yeast
really
makes
the
flavors
come
together
tons
of
hay
and
cut
grass
and
a
little
citrus
before
the
hop
bitterness
kicks
in
awesome
mouthfeel
really
bright
on
the
tongue
with
very
active
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
that
feels
bigger
than
it
is
i
think
this
is
so
well
in
balance
and
so
interesting
up
there
with
red
barn
and
carnivale
and
the
other
saison
type
beers
they
brew
this
is
an
a
overall
not
as
complex
or
as
enjoyable
as
i
expect
from
a
small
expensive
bottle
from
san
marcos
o
this
is
really
a
funky
beer
with
lots
and
lots
of
funk
however
while
there
is
a
good
amount
of
it
it
does
slightly
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
sweet
with
a
good
bit
of
acidity
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
brisk
carbonation
initial
sweetness
with
notes
of
bubblegum
and
banana
tart
acid
around
mid
palate
faintly
medicinal
with
an
herbal
bitterness
and
extremely
dry
finish
vinous
flavors
linger
in
the
mouth
faint
notes
of
vinegar
apples
and
pears
pretty
good
and
very
funky
o
nice
subtle
hops
behind
tons
of
brett
should
have
aged
this
one
a
bit
o
i
love
regular
devotion
and
this
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
great
yeast
oriented
flavours
pricey
but
certainly
worth
a
pickup
on
a
single
d
very
interesting
beer
kinda
gives
you
a
blend
of
more
than
one
style
pricey
but
tasty
ov
if
the
yeast
didnt
overwhelm
the
other
flavours
so
much
this
would
be
a
brilliant
brew
i
would
have
it
again
and
imagine
this
would
pair
very
well
with
food
the
smell
is
all
belgian
lots
of
funky
brett
and
yeasty
esters
very
nice
the
taste
follows
champagne
like
spritziness
and
barnyard
funk
tastes
of
mild
spice
and
some
fruity
hoppy
character
balance
with
the
pale
maltiness
of
the
beer
for
a
really
nice
balanced
taste
id
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
chunky
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
some
interesting
chunks
of
sediment
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
citrus
zest
pepper
and
brett
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
brett
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
some
solid
flavors
overall
pretty
good
offering
from
lost
abbey
its
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
but
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
trying
to
seek
it
out
this
is
really
good
the
aroma
in
particular
is
delightful
as
far
as
how
much
it
differs
from
their
regular
devotion
i
cant
say
but
stands
up
on
its
own
as
a
great
beer
gonna
have
to
grab
one
more
to
throw
in
the
cellar
and
let
the
brett
do
its
thing
o
the
grape
sweetness
and
funky
citrusy
brett
mix
quite
well
together
in
this
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
o
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
delicate
complexity
to
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
that
i
can
really
appreciate
i
really
enjoy
brett
but
it
is
a
little
too
dominant
in
the
flavor
for
me
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
would
get
another
one
of
these
and
it
is
available
at
a
fairly
reasonable
price
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
brett
beer
id
definatly
come
back
to
this
a
worthy
beer
indeed
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
la
b
beer
is
light
and
thin
and
very
spicy
on
the
palate
sweet
at
times
but
the
base
beer
is
completely
gone
leaving
me
with
this
overly
brett
beer
with
few
describable
characteristics
the
beer
appears
hazy
and
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
coats
the
glass
in
lacing
the
aroma
offers
strong
brettanomyces
funk
malt
smell
and
flavor
dominated
by
brett
very
tasty
light
in
body
and
easy
drinking
a
solid
brew
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brett
beer
light
and
crisp
quite
easy
to
drink
clear
light
orange
with
a
nice
white

has
decent
retention
and
moderate
lacing
the

brilliant
brett

with
pineapples
tart
fruit
spicy
cloves
white
pepper
i
dont
think
ive
had
the
base
beer
but
the
brett
has
completely
covered
it
up
some
honey
is
present
too
the
palate
opens
way
too
sweet
almost
like
someone
dumped
some
splenda
or
equal
in
this
beer
again
theres
a
blend
of
white
pepper
clove
and
pineapple
very
highly
carbonated
this
beer
is
a
little
too
spicy
and
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
decent
a
fantastic
version
of
a
somewhat
boring
beer
i
would
love
for
this
to
replace
the
regular
devotion
or
at
least
be
brewed
again

lemon
peel
lovely

flavors
matched
with
brett
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
better
version
of
the
original
devotion
i
wish
they
replaced
it
with
this
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
with
a
nice
drinkable
feel
it
is
slightly
refreshing
and
holds
a
funky
character
that
stays
throughout
d
easy
drinker
for
sure
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
be
a
welcome
companion
that
i
could
stick
with
all
day
it
isnt
overly
complex
or
unusual
but
it
is
still
pretty
tasty
still
wishing
there
was
more
brett
though
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
the
nice
dry
finish
from
the
brett
and
crisp
ale
and
light
pale
hops
a
nice
drinkable
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
nice
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
funky
musty
brett
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
dominate
the
nose
alongside
some
spice
slight
citrus
faint
grassy
and
apple
notes
the
taste
also
has
the
belgian
yeast
character
but
the
musty
funky
breet
is
not
as
potent
but
is
well
balanced
with
citrus
spice
and
slight
clove
accents
honestly
the
flavor
leans
more
towards
a
saison
with
brett
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
spice
musty
funky
and
bubbly
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
but
like
i
mentioned
its
probably
better
categorized
as
a
saison
i
still
was
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
and
a
variation
of
the
devotion
finish
is
a
bitter
grapefruit
grassy
green
spicy
character
leaves
you
really
wanting
more
d
utterly
drinkable
the
funk
with
over
a
year
and
a
half
to
settle
in
really
controls
the
ale
the
dry
body
leaves
a
lasting
impression
on
my
palate
a
light
grassy
brett
beer
pretty
refreshing
but
a
little
light
and
tough
d
perfect
beer
for
a
summers
day
and
about
eleventybillion
times
better
then
regular
devotion
interesting
but
not
great
very
subtle
on
the
sour
aspects
glad
i
wasnt

to
pay
for
this

a

lingered
a
long

with
the
dryness
could
have
drank
the
bottle
probably
but
pretty
filling
considering
its
abv
too
dry
with
misplaced
heavy
sweetness
at
times
not
the
smoothest
belgian
style
beer
out
there
the
brettanomyces
will
probably
develop
more
as
time
goes
on
but
it
is
already
starting
to
really
dry
things
out
devotion
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
begin
with
but
this
helps
a
little
bit
in
some
areas
not
too
bad
worth
trying
decent
brew
better
than
most
experiences
i
had
with
la
as
this
one
at
least
has
some
carbonation
but
the
funkiness
is
not
nearly
where
i
expected

with

a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
emerges
but
is
quickly
taken

woo
hoo
pretty
easy
going
down
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
original
version
id
love
to
see
what
some
age
would
do
to
the
brett
overall
good
brew
for
sure
brettanomyces
tasted
immediately
and
blends
rather
seemlessly
with
the
lemonwheaty
malt
and
zesty
hops
nice
little
prick
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
extremely
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
downed
the
whole
750
in
no
time
due
to
only
being
6
i
think
more
time
in
the
cellar
to
let
out
more
of
the
brett
character
is
in
order
though
it
has
imo
the
possibility
of
getting
much
funkier
glad
i
picked
up
extras
when
i
could
how
much
does
spiking
the
bottle
with
brett
cost
this
is
much
superior
to
regular
devotion
and
id
buy
this
regularly
unlike
regular
devotion
which
i
only
bought
for
ab
comparison
purposes
please
bring
this
one
back
tomme
the
body
is
moderate
with
a
clean
finish
a
light
carbonation
this
will
be
very
interesting
to
compare
and
contrast
over
a
few
years

with
a
thin

that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
lightly
lemony
and
grassy
and
slightly
metallic
on
the
finish
this
brett
is
still
young
and
this
should
sour
up
and
become
more
complex
over
time
tastes
quite
bitter
and
somewhat
funky
with
a
nice
earthiness
and
a
little
funky
but
nbot
sour
at
all
smooth
bitter
and
earthy
in
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
stinging
bitterness
that
lingers
nice
but
will
probably
get
better
drinkability
a
tasty
upgrade
to
the
standard
devotion
the
somewhat
more
subtle
brett
addition
allows
for
some
fine
penetrating
complexities
without
losing
sight
of
the
original
beer
or
suffering
from
lack
of
drinkability
a
springtime
picnic
with
sharp
cheeses
grapes
and
pepperoncini
would
be
a
perfect
match
i
definitely
like
this
a
bit
more
than
the
standard
devotion
the
brett
adds
that
little
something
extra
to
this
nicely
hoppy
belgianesque
ale
the
sharp
brett
notes
actually
compliment
the
hop
character
i
really
wished
i
hadnt
missed
out
on
picking
up
a
couple
extras
of
this
beer
one
is
simply
not
enough

some

lacking

just
not

my
favorites
in

drinking
it
smooth
sly
lush

blast

fresh
and
palatable
dry
fruit
then
loads
of

its
all
very

funky
bretty
zesty
what
was
that
yum
not
the
best
ive
had
from
lost

a
very
very

that
uses
brett

element

a

improvement
over
the
regular

gives
it
that
punchflavor
it
was
missing
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
wanting
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
as
it
was
just
not
as
big
of
an
experiment
as
it
could
have
been
still
a
very
good
beer
and
not
something
i
would
turn
a
nose
up
at
i
have
to
say
this
was
by
far
the
best
perk
of
the
lost
abbey
saints
club
probably
the
best
use
of
brett
that
i
have
ever
tasted
it
was
incredibly
well
balanced
and
integrated
the
brett
complimented
the
other
flavors
rather
than
overwhelming
them
crisp
carbonation
nice

character
a
little
bit
of
funk
with
just
a
hint
of
tartness
on
the
buds
and
a
wild
horse
blanket
aftertaste
made
this
one
hell
of
a
nice
brew
the
taste
is
initially
hoppy
like
the
regular
devotion
saints
devotion
is
a
well
hopped
belgian
pale
ale
but
there
is
an
added
layer
of
sour
funk
flavors
of
tart
lemon
spices
and
some
coriander
long
bitter
dry
finish
with
a
final
lingering
tartness
the
beer
is
not
very
sour
but
the
brett
is
definitely
there
the
carbonation
is
very
good
yeah
thats
a
nice
one
this
one
was
another
great
beer
from
la
trappe
an
excellent
offering
with
a
very
good
balance
that
made
it
an
easy
beer
to
drink
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
and
plenty
of
carbonation
a
good
beer
and
one
that
ill
not
be
afraid
to
pick
up

this

simple
is
the

o
while
this

not
my
favorite

it
is
a

i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
quite
an
easy
drinking
style
but
not
a
lot
happening
flavour
wise
this
is
a
good
brew
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
and
can
be
drank
in
large
quantities
o
4
5
o
for
beeing
a
trappist
beer
not
very
exciting
but
for
a
standard
belgian
pale
ale
not
too
shabby
a
decent
blond
ale
that
is
good
on
tap
but
not
really
a
trappist
recipe
that
stands
out
like
others
i
hope
to
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
and
with
luck
even
find
them
on
tap
i
have
this
feeling
that
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
as
it
brings
out
a
more
desired
sweetness
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
revisit
it
any
time
soon
especially
if
the
bottled
versions
arent
bottle
conditioned
worth
a
try
as
it
still
manages
to
be
a
modest
beer
for
what
it
is
carbonation
is
perfect
i
think
and
it
feels
good
its
a
good
beer
overall
and
mostly
pleasant
but
im
not
keen
on
the
metallic
bit
liked
the
orval
better
o
probably
my
least
favorite
trappist
beer
thus
far
nothing
about
it
really
impressed
me
but
it
wasnt
bad
for
the
price
i
have
no
problem
with
it
but
would
probably
opt
for
something
else
though
m
it
is
a
pleasant
sensation
maybe
could
be
a
little
more
complex
because
of
some
bitterness
that
doesnt

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
we
found
here
inclusions
of
wheat
and
sweetening
esters
which
helped
raise
it
from
a
standard
or
dull
beer
in
this
category
the
taste
however
did
fall
a
bit
flat
it
began
nicely
but
by
the
end
of
the
sip
and
even
more
so
by
the
end
of
the
glass
the
taste
became
metallic
and
capable
of
overwhelming
the
palate

something

of

a

not
nearly

still
thereabouts
bit
of
candied

and
a
very
light

not

pretty
straightforward
with
the

to
the

perhaps
a

of

somehow
not
really
great
drinking
not
as
refreshing
as
hoped
and
certainly
on

sweeter
side
for
the

not
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
this
is
remarkably
similar
to
a
hefe
really
refreshing
d
good
drinkability
just
as
expected
of
this
blond
beer
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
but
its
not
divine
overall
a
decent
beer
although
it
didnt
feel
like
a
blonde
beer
md
light
to
medium
body
with
a
nice
mellow
carbonation
i
found
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
light
on
the
palette
it
went
very
well
with
the
salad
and
fish
we
had
for
dinner
drinkability
it
goes
down
well
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
lacks
the
punchy
flavours
and
complexity
of
many
belgian
and
trappist
beers
diminishing
its
appeal
poured
from
a
750ml

the

their

quite
good
this
one
not
so
much
arguably
the
weakest
brand
of
the
trappist
group
it
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
a
little
unispired
when
compared
to
its
colleagues
this
beer
fulfills
its
label
promise
of
being
a
trappist
blonde
a
good
bright
orange
with
a
healthy

a
sweet
yeasty
and
familiar
nose
follows
on
palate
with
a
sticky
nottoosweet
slightly
warming
mouthfeel
a
little
awkward
in
the
finish
but
still
very
drinkable
a
decent
beer
that
is
just
unfortunately
out
of
its
league
with
the
other
trappists
not
as
good
as
la
trappe
dubbel
but
still
worth
trying
i
would
choose
this
over
a

to
be

and
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of

worth

in

very

is
somewhat

felt
a

i
was
taking
as

just
there
in
the
aftertaste
where
vanilla
reigns
wouldve
liked
something
a
bit
more
crisp
and
not
quite
so
full
in
body
usually
id
get
off
on
a
full
body
but
that
coupled
with
lower
carbonation
just
makes
this
low
alcohol
sweet
and
very
unbalancedas
it
should
bebpa
i
mean
supposed
to
be
malty
ale
not
all
that
great
in
the
mouth
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
as
well
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
belgian
pale
ales
ive
had
i
must
say
that
this
is
one
that
i
dont
prefer
over
the
others
ive
had
though
i
am
most
likely
comparing
this
brew
to
the
likes
of
duvel
it
should
still
have
a
similar
yet
toned
down
flavor
i
just
think
that
the
almost
cloying
vanilla
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
all
in
all
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
too
cloying
i
mean
i
got
this
with
a
gift
set
which
included
a
goblet
goblets
are
for
deep
sips
i
try
that
with
this
and
almost
gag
because
i
find
it
too
cloying
ill
most
likely
not
purchase
this
brew

a

underwhelmed
by
this
poured
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
a
slighty
hazy
copper
color
with
an
average
off
white
head
that
left
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
side
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
disappointing
for
a
trappist
the
taste
is
similar
to
that
of
fizzy
apple
juice
not
much
in
the
way
of
belgian
spicinessfunkiness
the
feel
is
light

finishes
very
dry
for
the
style
a
decent
drinker
but
not
any
better
than
leffe
worth
a
try
but
wont
seek
out
again
sadly
i
have
to
report
this
is
the
worst
trappist
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
ive
had
almost
them
all
i
have
another
which
i
will
stash
away
but
this
is
not
what
i
wanted
or
expected
poured
more
of
a
dark
pale
than
a
blonde
with
a
nice
head
that
left
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
right
when
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
i
got
a
hint
of
caramel
but
that
left
leaving
a
spicey
sweet
smell
tastes
like
sweet
apple
juice
slightly
spiced
with
cloves
then
the
cloves
take
over
and
the
beer
finishes
bitter
not
very
full
this
feels
thin
after
the
first
rush
of
sweetness
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
back
that
warms
but
is
thinner
than
expected
really
this
beer
was
a
let
down
i
love
their
quad
but
this
is
just
soso
id
drink
it
again
if
given
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
go
hunting
for
it
pours
darker
than
expected
less
blond
than
amber
although
on
the
light
side
of
that
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
nice
chunky
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
phenolic
aroma
with
tons
of
banana
notes
and
cloves
the
palate
is
very
sweet
too
much
so
really
and
features
a
creamy
clove
flavor
that
is
a
bit
offputting
a
substantial
bitter
edge
comes
up
at
the
finish
and
saves
things
somewhat
but
overall
this
beer
is
just
average
for
a
belgian
blond
it
has
little
in
the
way
of
fresh
fruit
aromatics
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thick
and
heavy

the

makes
the

almost
unnoticable

i
recommend
to
skip
this
in

of
the

i
do
not

the

everyone
else
is
talking
about
rather
a
more
upfront

taste
in

of

there
is
however
a
lot
of
effervescing
going
on
both
in

especially
in
the
tongue
the
first
sips
are
a
little
offputting

like
most
beers
as
you
become
accustomed
to
the

it
becomes

would
order
something
else
for
the
next
round
is
this
beer
drinkable
yes
highly
enjoyable
not
so
much
flavor
is
lacking
and
somewhat
disappointing
so
many
better
beers
of
this
or
a
similar
style
are
out
there
not
bad
but
no
where
near
great
notes
i
got
this
at
wegmans
liquor
and
they
store
select
bottled
beers
in
a
special
wine
display
which
is
sideways
it
looks
good
and
im
impressed
they
would
bother
but
this
is
not
optimial
storage
for
many
corked
brews
for
example
the
cork
broke
as
i
was
trying
to
remove
it
from
the
bottle
not
cool
i
had
to
resort
to
a
wine
opener
to
finish
the
job
another
time
i
got
st
bernardus
abt
12
and
once
i
took
the
cage
off
i
the
cork
popped
again
not
cool
nothing
to
scoff
at
mouth
feel
is
nice
a
liiiittle
watery
very
drinkable
an
overall
tasty
beer
drinkability
tasty
stuff
at
a
tasty
price
sure
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
equally
forgettable
i
know
this
beer
will
get
overlooked
in
my
mental
belgian
beer
rolodex
there
are
much
better
beers
then
this
one
i
probably
wouldve
passed
on
this
beer
but
the
750ml
was
on
sale
in
parkville
mo
for
3
00
good
deal
worth
a
try
taste
is
fruity
but
very
carbonic
unfortunately
some
banana
flavours
acetylic
too
not
very
great
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
special
but
ok
pours
a
goodlooking
golden
color
with
a
rocky
tan
head
smells
of
sour
grapes
and
cherries
slight
lemon
molasses
and
brown
sugar
tastes
like
dark
fruit
with
a
distinct
lemon
peel
flavor
towards
the
end
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
than
i
expected
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
fairly
clean
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
as
good
as
is
expected
for
a
belgian
a
little
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
is
a
little
above
average
because
this
is
not
that
complex
of
a
beer
not
a
bad
belgian
a
good
middleoftheroad
beer
taste
can
best
be
described
as
a
young
version
of
the
triple
crisp
and
fruity
as
expected
with
banana
subtleties
upset
i
never
tried
this
before
would
love
to
try
it
in
a
750
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
i
really
need
a
girlfriend
very
enjoyable
to
sip
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
dubbel
or
tripel
pours
with
a
nice
tinybubbled
head
which
is
expected
from
the
style
slow
to
disipate
smells
of
fruit
kind
of
like
pear
nice
aroma
tastes
crisp
even
taste
some
pear
or
apple
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitter
finish
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
very
drinkable
although
drinking
too
much
might
knock
you
on
your
butt
taste
is
very
smooth
and
not
overpowering
spicy
in
the
beginning
and
sweet
and
tangy
in
the
end
no
real
alcohol
notes
are
apparent
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
weak
triple
very
easy
to
drink
just
lacking
a
bit
in
flavor
i
would
try
this
beer
again
another
stellar
product
from
this
brewery
great
aroma
from
yeast
fruity
peach
and
secondary
citrus
taste
easy
drink
good
1st
or
2nd
beer
a
great
pale
hoppy
too
honey
malt
and
nice
malt
and
yeast
aftertaste
opaque
orange
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
imho
no
brouhaha
here
i
am
partial
to
belgian
beer
but
this
one
is
not
very
remarkable
and
poorly
balanced
this
one
comes
out
of
a
gift
set
including
4
beers
plus
a
nice
goblet
with
the
brewery
logo
this
beer
pours
a
hearty
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
cover
the
beer
with
an
eighth
of
an
inch
of
foam
the
nose
is
lemonyorange
with
a
nice
sweet
malty
background
the
flavor
is
nice
and
sweet
with
minimal
carbonation
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
malt
there
is
a
bit
of
an
orange
undertone
in
this
as
well
wih
a
slight
hint
of
a
hop
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
really
pleasant
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
that
lingers
and
entices
me
to
drink
more
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
a
moderately
thick
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
overall
i
like
the
beer
im
anxious
to
try
the
other
3
i
have
from
this
brewery
theres
a
small
almost
white
fizzy
head
leaving
runny
spots
of
lacing
the
beer
is
a
hazy
orangegold
nose
is
faintly
fruity
almost
apples
with
a
little
caramel
the
front
is
syrupy
caramel
but
not
too
sweet
a
very
malty
middle
turns
bitter
to
finish
alcholic
very
bready
and
tangy
dry
its
a
good
belgian
blonde
solid
tasty
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
huge
thick
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
citric
with
some
maltiness
extremely
smooth
flavor
surprising
for
a
trappist
i
see
most
reviews
are
poor
for
this
beer
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
agree
that
it
doesnt
totally
fit
the
trappist
style
nor
is
it
strong
enough
or
yeasty
enough
for
the
blonde
style
but
i
found
this
surprisingly
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
suspect
i
got
an
old
bottle
some
of
whose
carbonation
may
have
been
lost
after
being
stored
upright
too
long
ive
had
the
blond
ale
in
years
past
and
i
remember
enjoying
it
more
than
this
or
perhaps
the
recipe
has
changed
disappointing
ive
had
the
complete
set
now
and
this
was
my
least
favorite
past
the
appearance
there
was
a
lack
of
character
that
was
present
in
the
other
three
koningshovens
this
one
starts
off
sharp
but
mellows
by
midsip
to
reveal
an
herbalfruity
bouquet
on
the
tongue
the
flavors
never
really
come
together
though
while
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
trappist
monks
very
nice
the
taste
is
very
smooth
highly
drinkable
there
is
a
fine
compliment
of
bitters
and
semisweet
flavors
it
is
not
a
very
heavy
or
thick
beer
and
it
goes
down
easily
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
sour
malt
and
a
sweet
hay
i
found
the
smell
very
winy
with
grapes
and
maybe
some
other
red
fruits
the
taste
is
very
citric
still
with
this
winy
aspect
wood
too
i
wouldnt
have
thought
about
honey
unless
i
hadnt
read
it
in
the
description
of
the
beer
on
the
label
the
beer
is
also
pretty
floral
maybe
with
a
hint
of
liquorice
the
hops
are
powerful
but
elegant
and
not
overwhelming
very
controlled
the
persistence
of
the
head
contribute
to
the
smooth
mouthfeel
the
slight
iodated
aspect
of
the
beer
makes
it
refreshing
but
i
dont
think
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
row
probably
one
of
the
least
interesting
beer
among
the
trappists
sampled
123103
a
decent
beer
but
not
impressive
as
i
remember
the
latrappe
drinkability
is
hampered
by
its
syrupy
sweet
mouthfeel
heavyhandedness
and
offalcohols
lightening
and
cleaning
this
up
a
bit
and
it
would
be
a
winner
but
not
a
very
good
representative
of
a
trappist
blonde
it
is
a
slight
orange
gold
color
with
a
soft
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
yeasty
it
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
spicy
finish
there
is
some
winey
notes
and
tastes
of
orange
zest
as
well
it
is
complex
but
lacks
a
certain
depth
that
many
belgian
abbey
beers
possess
koningshoeven
version
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
some
brownishorange
highlights
frothy
beige
head
thats
sticking
around
for
a
while
good
lacing
and
adherence
to
the
side
of
the
la
trappe
snifter
toasty
malt
and
candi
sugar
aroma
and
bit
of
mustiness
in
the
nose
too
a
bit
on
the
higher
abv
side
for
a
blond
malty
profile
thats
a
bit
nutty
and
diacetyllike
finishes
a
bit
carbonated
and
lingering
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
for
a
blond
in
my
opinion
but
nonetheless
good
overall
a
solid
beer
because
of
its
richness
for
a
blond
i
cant
say
i
could
drink
many
backtoback
an
amber
pour
with
slight
clouiness
and
a
small
white
head
that
slowly
fades
down
to
a
mere
ring
the
nose
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
raw
sugar
the
taste
is
semi
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
and
the
caramel
finish
lingers
nicely
and
quite
long
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
medium
bodies
overall
there
are
better
blondes
and
therefore
the
drinkability
isnt
ranked
very
high
the
nose
is
fruity
and
malty
and
this
sense
follows
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
is
quite
strong
and
gives
a
sweet
malt
sense
that
is
quite
fruity
and
full
of
banana
the
feel
is
clean
and
full
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
sadly
the
finish
is
flat
picked
it
up
as
part
of
a
four
pack
sampler
heres
hopin
some
of
the
next
three
are
a
little
more
interesting
i
think
i
got
suckered
in
by
the
packaging
here
large
brown
bottle
with
champagne
style
cork
as
if
im
not
going
to
finish
this
in
one
sitting
although
i
must
say
ive
learned
that
this
is
the
perfect
amount
of
beer
for
me
on
a
weeknight
to
get
a
good
grasp
of
the
brew
and
form
an
opinion
the
color
was
deep
golden
slightly
cloudy
poured
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
held
up
for
most
of
the
glass
and
created
a
nice
lace
down
the
side
the
smell
was
sweet
almost
sticky
with
an
appricot
overtone
the
taste
was
pleasant
and
understated
but
a
bit
too
fruity
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
heavy
but
not
overbearing
i
thought
this
was
decent
but
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
belgian
style
hope
to
be
someday
and
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
these
1
9
liter
bottles
also
a
little
expensive
in
my
opinion
upon
pouring
from
the
bottle
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
modest
sized
head
that
is
bright
white
in
color
creamy
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
a
diaphanous
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
citrus
crisp
with
nice
malt
sweetness
lightly
floral
refreshing
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
start
is
malt
laden
somewhat
sweet
top
middling
in
feel
the
acidic
finish
is
astringent
the
hops
bountiful
but
not
overpowering
droughty
slightly
tart
aftertaste
last
long
after
the
swallow
a
quite
nice
blond
as
this
is
not
a
favorite
style
with
me
but
this
one
does
hit
the
spot
this
is
a
very
pleasant
tasting
ale
poured
out
a
slightly
hazed
golden
color
with
one
of
the
most
attractive
heads
of
foam
i
can
remember
huge
rocky
dense
and
creamy
the
aroma
was
slightly
sticky
sweet
with
candy
sugar
with
some
fruitiness
taste
was
lightly
sweet
and
sour
with
some
yeast
there
was
no
hiding
the
alcohol
in
this
beer

it
came
right
through
on
the
whole
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
and
light
belgium
ale
fruity
aroma
this
beer
poured
a
big
creamy
long
lasting
head
this
beer
left
a
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
body
was
cloudy
with
an
amber
hue
the
nose
of
this
beer
was
fruity
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
smooth
sweet
and
fruity
taste
to
it
it
didnt
taste
bitter
or
have
an
overwhelmig
aftertaste
to
it
i
would
drink
this
brew
again
carefully
poured
this
blonde
delivers
a
clear
amber
body
with
yellowgold
highlights
its
a
little
bit
darker
than
might
be
expected
but
its
frothy
offwhite
head
holds
rather
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
before
settling
to
a
creamy
14
head
a
sweetish
candy
and
honeylike
malt
resides
in
the
nose
very
meadlike
in
a
way
its
not
complex
but
it
is
clean
and
nice
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
gently
zesty
on
the
tongue
before
warming
to
become
just
lightly
creamy
with
a
very
fine
median
carbonation
the
semirich
honeyish
malt
dominates
the
flavor
throughout
balanced
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
a
light
wash
of
alcohol
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
note
of
fruity
malt
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
nice
beer
thats
straightforward
and
enjoyable
although
the
alcoholtends
to
come
forward
a
bit
too
much
at
times
not
the
most
complex
or
best
example
of
style
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
brew
has
a
fruity
floral
aroma
it
poured
a
nice
long
lasting
head
of
small
and
medium
white
bubbles
that
left
a
good
lacing
its
body
is
a
nice
cloudy
amber
brown
color
initial
taste
caught
me
off
guard
but
later
settled
into
something
nice
nice
drinkable
brew
with
a
mellow
subtle
flavor
pours
a
very
pleasant
coppery
gold
color
the
head
was
light
and
short
lived
the
nose
is
exceptionally
sweet
and
spiced
malt
with
hop
notes
the
flavor
is
moderately
dry
malt
and
lightly
hopped
there
is
some
really
unique
spice
notes
here
that
are
very
difficult
to
identify
the
taste
is
clean
and
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
very
good
belgian
here

try
it

i
highly
recommend
this
one
is
this
different
somehow
than
the
old
la
trappe
blond
seems
quite
a
bit
worse
than
the
alterego
from
what
i
recall
poured
a
bright
golden
color
and
was
very
high
in
carbonation
with
a
very
large
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
pleasant
mildly
spiced
and
citrusy
the
taste
also
was
very
soft
and
smooth
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
sweetness
on
the
front
with
a
crisper
finish
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
did
seem
a
little
cidery
very
reminiscent
of
my
first
attempt
at
homebrewing
the
head
was
around
for
the
whole
glass
and
left
a
lot
of
lacing
this
was
my
first
trappist
ale
and
i
was
surpised
i
had
expected
something
a
little
stronger
a
little
sweeter
basically
something
just
a
little
bit
out
there
compared
to
what
i
am
used
to
so
unfortunately
i
cant
comment
on
whether
this
suits
the
style
however
the
rating
it
currently
has
seems
to
state
that
it
is
not
the
best
representation
of
a
trappist
ale
however
i
did
enjoy
it
nonetheless
drinkabilitynotes
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
and
inoffensive
beer
which
i
would
characterize
as
trappist
light
its
probably
a
good
beer
to
offer
to
someone
who
is
new
to
trappiststyle
ales
although
connoisseurs
of
true
trappist
ales
will
probably
be
disappointed
pours
a
hazy
bright
golden
orange
color
with
a
very
tall
and
pillowy
white
head
that
coats
the
walls
of
the
glass
as
it
slowly
fades
into
a
creamy
lace
nose
is
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
fresh
banana
clove
and
nutmeg
smooth
and
extremely
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
medium
in
body
taste
is
dominated
by
creamy
banana
with
additional
flavors
of
fresh
citrus
ripe
peaches
clove
nutmeg
and
vanilla
very
nice
im
surprised
to
see
some
of
the
low
ratings
for
this
beer
as
i
found
it
to
be
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
hefeweizen
but
a
bit
more
complex
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
full
frothy
white
head
nose
is
subtle
but
still
fruity
spicy
notes
of
butter
bubblegum
and
bananas
more
fruits
come
through
later
primarily
peach
apricot
citrus
good
hops
on
the
sweet
palate
but
they
lay
low
afterwards
an
oily
slick
feeling
takes
over
malt
feels
insufficient
texture
is
far
too
thin
and
watery
body
is
slight
overall
a
disappointment
this
was
never
my
favorite
style
of
the
la
trappes
but
that
one
was
never
this
bad
i
could
taste
test
them
as
there
are
still
some
la
trappes
hanging
around
but
that
would
mean
buying
another
bottle
of
this
ive
had
all
the
la
trappe
beers
and
i
must
say
that
i
didnt
know
if
this
one
would
hold
up
against
the
other
three
i
saw
blond
on
the
bottle
and
expected
something
wimpy
of
course
i
should
have
known
better
this
beer
was
great
maybe
even
my
favorite
of
the
four
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
with
a
persistant
white
head
aroma
is
musty
and
sweet
and
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
barn
some
hay
in
the
aroma

a

with

has
a

declicate
flavor
that
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
expected
after
the
setup
that
the
aroma
gave
a
pretty
good
beer

not

liked

in

not
a

a
good

of
hot

sense
to
balance
the
brew
nice
beer
puts
brews
like
leffe
blonde
in
a
back
seat
not
a
favorite
in
the
overall
world
of
beerdom
but
a
drinkable
rendition
of
style
brilliantly
clear

covered
by
a

that
recedes
into
a
spotty
but
persistent

at

sufficiently
to
allow

well
attenuated
and

with
the

by
the

with

blond
is
a
tame
and
understated
belgian
pale
ale
its
main
strength
lies
in
its
refreshing
nature
and
high

quite
enjoyable
but
not
outstanding
this
was
the

2

that
is

big

malt
flavor
medium
to
light
body
slight
smoke
taste
to
the
finish
not
a
special
beer
but
an
ok
selection
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
sudsy
white
head
with
some
nice
lace
some
carbonation
definate
aroma
of
hops
and
some
citrus
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
citrus
the
finish
was
slightly
tangy
no
doubt
due
to
the
carbonation
and
citrus
a
good
beer
notes
gets
better
around
cellar
temp
as
suggested
on
the
back
label
5055f
not
a
bad
brew
but
more
of
an
acquired
taste
the
astringent
slight
oxidized
character
seems
to
take
over
mostly
oddly
this
brew
is
filtered
and
there
is
no
form
of
secondary
fermentation
in
the
bottle
which
is
totally
associated
with
this
style
of
beer
hence
the
formation
of
oxidation
and
corkiness
in
the
beers
character
good
representation
of
the
style
so
i
may
be
a
bit
biased
because
i
got
twelve
packs
of
this
stuff
for
9
99
on
clearance
in
early
summer
of
2014
didnt
expect
much
but
really
hit
the
spot
typical
belgo
pale
flavors
nothing
stood
out
but
a
good
warm
weather
quaff
rating
c
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
high
levels
of
carbonation
finish
this
off
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
id
reach
out
for
again
fairly
laidback
and
one
dimensional
but
refreshing
o
pleasant
light
summer
ale
good
working
in
the
yard
kind
of
beer
nothing
crazy
about
it
but
just
a
good
kick
back
after
work
and
relax
kind
of
brew
huge
dense
white
foam
head
like
three
fingers
but
fades
quickly
bright
and
lively
in
the
glass
surprisingly
clear
for
a
blegianstyle
golden
straw
with
tangerine
highlights
smell
is
a
creamy
doughiness
grassiness
hoppy
florals
quite
aromatic
and
appetizing
taste
is
right
up
there
with
what
you
might
want
in
a
springseaon
ale
crisp
clean
and
simple
pale
malt
bill
right
upfront
with
a
nottobitter
hop
finish
not
much
else
but
quite
good
a
nice
reminder
that
simple
beers
can
be
great
too
oa
boring
bland
beer
not
much
good
i
guess
not
being
awful
is
a
good
thing
o
new
belgiums
spring
blonde
might
not
have
a
ton
of
malt
flavor
its
also
light
on
the
hoppiness
though
floral
aspects
emerge
it
doesnt
even
come
straightforward
with
its
belgian
yeast
nuances
but
what
spring
blonde
does
have
is
exceptional
balance
among
these
attributes
the
finished
product
has
just
enough
flavor
to
command
interest
but
not
enough
to
make
multiple
beers
a
chore
this
one
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
for
an
easy
drinking
wellcrafted
experience
got
a
free
bottle
of
this
one
from
my
beer
guy
not
something
id
normally
try
this
offering
pours
a
very
clear
golden
hue
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
sweet
belgian
yeast
lemon
juice
and
biscuit
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
flavors
follow
the
nose
with
belgian
yeast
and
lemon
upfront
it
is
a
very
light
and
refreshing
pour
especially
for
the
adv
drinks
like
a
light
beer
at
best
this
is
a
refreshing
enjoyable
summertime
beer
but
lacks
complexity
or
depth
good
but
overly
simple
overall
while
a
bit
light
in
the
belgian
spice
the
belgian
malt
was
quite
nice
and
made
for
an
interesting
and
overall
nice
drinking
brew
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
and
has
a
pretty
solid
taste
for
me
it
was
especially
tasty
on
a
recent
hot
day
it
is
very
refreshing
and
i
would
encourage
those
that
enjoy
belgian
blonde
ales
to
give
this
one
a
try
because
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
had
new

does
good
stuff
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint

gonna
find
under

a
bottle
the
taste
of

was
overwhelming
and
not
in
a
good
way
i
struggled
through
the
first
bottle
of
the
six

hoping
it
would
grow
on

and
then
dumped
the
rest
down
the

what
a
disappointment
i
would
highly
recommend
that
you
do
not
try
this
beer
i
have
been
extremely
happy
with
all
other
new
belgium
beers
that
i
have
purchased
but
this
one
seems
to
miss
the
target
so
disappointing
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
fourth

i
could
serve
this
to
any

drinker
and
it
would
not

anyone

not

makes
this
a
beer
worth
looking
for
this
beer
is
really
a
great
beer
although
it
lacks
super
strong
flavor
what
it
does
have
is
better
than
average
flavor
that
i
love
its
like
samuel

a

the

to

know

real

should
taste
like
overall
i
found
this
and
a

other
new

at

this
one
was
good

not

good
at

i
had
thanks
for
the
brew
kirk
d
not
a
bad
beer

pretty

its
burpy

can
satisfy
on
a
hot
day
in
that
this

the
taste
is
a
bit
more
bold
than
the

last
throughout

leaving

the
aroma
is
mild
with
some
light
notes
of
grass

the
taste
is
also
mild
but
a
little
more
forthright
than
the

with
a
pleasant

flavor
balanced
against
some

o
this
ones
slightly
better
than
i
anticipated
while
the
belgian

is
almost
a
nonfactor
its
still
a
decent
beer
thanks
to
the
mild
bitterness
and
easydrinking
nature
its
not
amazing
or
complex
but
itll
get
the
job
done
worth
trying
this
was
a
very
surprisingly
good
beer
i
am
always
wary
of
beers
that
are
bitter
such
as
ipas
as
this
one
claims
to
be
bitter
well
it
was
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
and
everything
else
great
golden
color
with
perfectly
white
head
the
head
goes
away
but
it
has
very
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
only
disappointment
was
the
smell
there
wasnt
much
there
to
distinguish
it
from
other
beers
the
rest
though
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
terrific
a
very
bold
crisp
feel
over
the
tongue
to
go
along
with
the
bold
crisp
taste
very
nice
offering
from
new
belgium
appearance

a
light
golden
yellow
supporting
a
white
head
slowly
dissipating
leaving
fair
lace
smell
is
very
light
of
belgian
spice
from
the
yeast
and
a
notable
malt
aroma
taste
is
again
light
in
the
belgian
spice
and
having
a
nice
balance
with
the
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
easy
drinker
for
the
upcoming
spring
season
overall
just
above
average
but
a
little
off
for
the
style
nothing
special
but
you
might
want
to
give
at
try
this
is
a
successful
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
thin
white
head
nose
features
some
mellow
belgian
esters
paired
with
bready
malts
and
some
sourdough
character
taste
has
notes
of
lemon
light
spice
and
a
light
malty
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
easy
drinker
but
nothing
too
exciting
here
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
belgian
style
ale
good
pilsner
like
biscuity
notes
with
some
fruit
presence
definitely
an
adequate
blonde
ale
and
well
enough
rendered
at
that
however
this
like
fat
tire
is
only
tangentially
belgian
a
small
point
sure
and
a
hard
one
to
refute
for
this
broad
style
i
know
worthy
of
giving
a
go
as
the
weather
starts
to
warm
the
hell
up
o
a
solid
beer
overall
more
like
a
pilsner
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
still
enjoyable
its
crisp
and
light
on
the
palate
with
a
crisp
bite
accompanied
by
a
soft
fluffiness
even
into
a
slightly
slick
but
gently
nipping
finish
o
easy
to
drink
completely
unremarkable
a
good
light
blonde
ale
excellent
color
with
slight
head
the
smell
is
mild
as
i
would
anticipate
with
a
beer
of
this
make
i
enjoy
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
this
good
early
springtime
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
and
i
feel
the
beer
is
underrated
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
belgian
pale
ale
it
really
tasted
more
like
a
solid
pilsner
whichever
way
you
would
classify
it
new
belgium
put
out
a
fairly
light
and
refreshing
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
smells
like
lemon
and
yeast
taste
is
subtle
lemon
and
a
very
strong
grassy
flavor
the
grass
throws
off
the
whole
beer
for
me
reminds
me
of
dirt
overall
its
okay
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
rating
this
as
a
blonde
ale
its
pretty
good
not
a
good
belgian
low
b
o
this
is
an
unusual
and
uncharacteristically
pedestrian
outing
for
new
belgium
due
to
buzzwords
like
belgian
and
ale
i
expected
something
very
different
but
i
wasnt
disappointed
at
all
if
you
like
biscuity
beers
and
dont
turn
your
nose
up
at
the
occasional
pint
of
lager
then
i
would
certainly
give
this
a
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
average
blonde
looking
beer
with
little
head
this
beer
is
average
at
best
and
i
was
kinda
disappointed
with
this
beer
usually
new
belgium
doesnt
disappoint
me
but
this
one
dead
taste
is
week
as
well
as
the
mouthful
and
the
smell
is
again
average
not
something
i
havent
had
the
nose
for
before
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
is
sticking
around
quite
nicely
very
bright
and

of
bright
citrus
slightly
sweet
i
bet
this
is
going
to
go
down
easy
and
be
quite
refreshing
taste
lemon
slightly
sour
some
bitterness
slight
biscuit
note
very
refreshing
only
thing
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
is
im
drinking
it
when
its
like
30

be

better

a
pale
straw
colored
appearance
completely
clarified
when
i
first
poured
it
i
was
getting
some
aromas
like
that
of
nbs
trippel
which
is
one
of
my
gotos
and
i
wondered
if
it
was
going
to
be
something
like
a
trippel
lite
closer
inspection
revealed
a
weakish
lemony
aroma
and
some
cornlike
malts
not
bad
but
not
what
i
would
call
stellar
first
taste
to
be
honest
i
could
barely
taste
anything
i
had
my
wife
taste
it
and
she
called
out
the
lemony
tart
front
end
and
the
bitter
finish
which
is
pretty
much
how
the
label
describes
it
as
i
got
through
the
glass
the
tartness
up
front
and
bitter
back
end
became
more
apparent
but
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
watery
i
compared
it
to
a
coors
light
which
i
have
nothing
against
just
not
something
i
drinkbuythink
about
with
any
regularity
it
does
have
a
little
more
going
on
than
a
cl
and
the
airy
mouthfeel
could
be
considered
refreshing
the
abv
is
low
enough
that
you
can
have
a
few
without
getting
totally
smashed
but
do
you
want
a
few
just
a
question
to
ask
yourself
jsyk
i
am
really
hard
on
belgian
pales
in
general
but
this
beer
did
not
stand
out
to
me
whatsoever
and
my
wife
used
the
word
pointless
to
describe
it
i
actually
do
like
new
belgium
and
buy
their
products
quite
a
bit
but
dont
need
to
get
this
one
again
at
first
pour
this
pale
ale
doesnt
look
fairly
distinct
in
appearance
from
others
of
the
style
but
then
the
head
begins
to
die
down
leaving
invitingly
luscious
lacings
malts
with
a
touch
of
coriander
contribute
to
a
light
airy
nose
this
beer
is
refreshingly
creamy
and
perfectly
smooth
in
the
mouth
lightly
sweet
with
blends
of
caramel
malts
and
butternut
squash
the
brew
is
highly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
warm
day
outdoors
on
the
porch
with
a
book
perhaps
a
bit
of
pre1960s
folk
is
playing
in
the
background
my
creole
belle
i
love
her
well
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grass
and
lemon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
malt
grass
and
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
verdict
pretty
good
very
well
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
i
wouldnt
mind
making
it
a
regular
session
beer
this
spring
the
dry
yeastiness
finally
takes
over
the
taste
buds
but
its
still
an
odd
sweet
and
sourish
combination
rather
bitter
aftertaste
with
the
candy
hints
attractive
golden
color
with
a
very
persistent
foam
in
the
glass
faint
aroma
of
cornmeal
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
a
vons
supermarket
o
a
good
if
hoppy
version
of
the
style
overall
it
is
a
mild
easy
to
drink
ale
just
dont
expect
it
to
be
duvel
rjt
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
overall
i
rate
this
beer
good
would
definitely
buy
again
but
in
the
spring
not
really
the
season
for
it
once
the
snow
goes
good
beer
o
no
where
close
to
anything
belgian
tasted
more
like
a
kolsch
or
a
pilsener
doesnt
drive
in
the
lanes
of
the
style
completely
but
a
nice
beer
none
the
less
a
nod
to
subtle
perfectly
sessionable
easy
drinking
but
not
very
complex
beer
does
pick
up
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
just
an
easy
drinker
that
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
at
a
ballgame
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
snifter
12114
taste
is
a
distinctively
belgian
pale
ale
style
with
a
sweet
malty
and
slightly
spicy
presence
up
front
and
a
tinge
of
floral
hops
just
below
this
is
a
lovely
and
wellbalanced
ale
that
remains
faithful
to
the
new
belgium
name
and
the
companys
more
distinctive
label
reinvention
liked
it
i
was
ecstatic
to
see
a
new
belgianblonde
ale
from
nb
and
picked
it
up
immediately
i
have
loved
everything
ive
ever
tasted
from
new
belgium
until
today
as
i
said
im
not
certain
if
i
received
a
poor
batch
but
im
incredibly
disappointed
with
the
quality
of
this
beer
im
amazed
that
a
craft
brewery
and
such
a
good
one
too
could
have
brewed
what
i
just
drank
a
good
brew
here
ill
enjoy
the
other
5
bottles
pours
translucent
light
golden
with
a
white
head
and
effervescence
bubbles
rising
to
surface
aroma
is
lemon
poppysead
bread
a
little
pepper
and
apple
flavor
is
similar
with
a
grassy
mildy
bitter
finish
this
one
definitely
leans
to
the
sweet
malty
side
of
things
for
me
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
meh
what
i
generally
have
come
to
think
of
most
nb
offerings
not
bad
but
not
one
i
will
bother
with
again
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
lemony
citrus
and
sweet
barley
once
poured
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
the
first
taste
explodes
with
sweet
barley
and
subtle
yeast
flavors
that
are
quickly
drawn
back
by
an
inviting
bitterness
the
after
taste
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
a
refreshing
feel
the
body
is
perfect
for
this
style
of
beer
this
is
definitely
a
goto
beer
for
me
perfectly
done
and
distinctly
belgium
well
done
new
belgium
well
done
indeed

o
an
enjoyable
beer
great
for
a
cool
spring
night
or
to
refresh
after
an
early
season
ride
i
like
the
balance
on
the
spice
and
fruit
additions
there
is
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
but
not
so
much
that
it
obscures
the
underling
beer
easy
drinking
but
a
little
to
mellow
for
my
tastes
best
by

pleasant
surprise
great
summer
beer
very
refreshing
but
still
very
flavorful
overall
i
would
say
that
that
a
better
name
for
this
beer
would
be
puddle
jumper
especially
when
some
spring
time
snowslush
is
involved
as
a
seasonal
it
just
mashes
up
the
spring
time
into
a
force
du
jour
that
straddles
fences
and
frustrates
the
drinker
into
dysfunction
o
average
that
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
this
beer
quite
refreshing
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
o
a
unique
and
interesting
fruitherb
beer
well
worth
trying
lots
of
subtleties
in
this
one
light
grainy
yellow
with
a
soapy
etched
top
smells
sweet
grassy
and
fruity
some
honeydew
some
corn
some
apricot
and
belgian
yeast
with
a
touch
of
clay
tastes
sweet
and
floral
some
more
honeydew
some
canteloupe
a
bit
of
edible
flowers
just
a
cut
of
gut
alfalfa
pretty
flavor
medium
bodied
with
tight
moderate
carb
and
a
watering
finish
an
interesting
beer
something
that
seems
it
would
be
nice
on
occassion
but
not
full
time
a
real
winner
for
a
seasonal
not
much
belgian
about
it
to
me
which
is
not
necessarily
a
negative
but
something
of
note
for
the
style
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
i
had
higher
expectations
but
it
was
an
ok
beer
o
whats
a
goji
berry
and
schisandra
who
knows
but
this
beer
apparently
nails
those
flavors
one
of
the
many
lawnmower
beers
that
satisfies
cravings
for
interesting
complex
taste
delicious
just
interesting
enough
not
gonna
go
looking
for
it
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
probably
meant
for
drinking
in
the
month
of
april
and
may
taste
is
nicely
spicy
and
fruity
theres
a
wellbalanced
melding
of
hoppy
citrus
and
biscuity
malts
enjoyable
and
welldone
session
ale
here
and
i
wish
this
were
available
more
widely
descent
i
enjoy
the
fresh
flavors
and
aromas
but
lacks
complexity
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
to
drink
on
a
warm
day
similar
to
a
pilsner
or
something
like
that
id
drink
it
again
but
nothing
wowed
me
about
it
i
think
this
is
just
a
refreshing
balanced
approachable
quaffable
brew
cheers
o
this
beer
has
no
faults
other
than
coming
off
a
little
acidic
but
due
to
the
simplicity
of
it
refreshing
and
nice
a
bit
too
plain
though
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
although
i
drank
it
on
a
damp
chilly
winter
night
i
imagine
it
to
be
a
great
refreshing
summer
beer
im
glad
they
included
it
in
the
sampler
12
pack
thirst
quenching
and
unique
not
the
best
thing
ive
had
recently
but
worth
trying
for
the
unique
ingredients
i
would
drink
this
again
in
warmer
weather
interesting
wheat
beer
with
a
sweet
berry
twist
almost
comparable
to
lineys
or
the
like
but
slightly
better
not
the
best
beer
from
new
belgium
and
actually
just
barely
worth
trying
get
a
single
if
you
can
pours
a
big
head
with
big
bubbles
somewhat
lasting
head
beer
has
a
very
clear
football
beerish
color
very
fizzy
very
malty
aroma
inhaling
deeply
floral
aroma
football
beerish
aroma
not
appealing
light
taste
malty
aftertaste
but
more
flavor
than
typical
football
beer
good
dry
malty
taste
on
the
tongue
reminds
me
a
little
of
sam
adams
lite
odd
combination
of
flavors
malts
somewhat
tempered
but
not
all
that
appealing
an
overall
flavor
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
half
finger
that
melts
to
very
sticky
lacing
nose
is
faint
belgium
yeast
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
surprising
on
this
a
balanced
mixture
of
pale
malts
citrusy
hops
definite
lemon
and
belgian
yeast
good
brew
by
new
belgium
drinkability
this
is
a
great
all
around
beer
where
is
the
nuanced
malt
profile
feels
like
new
belgium
decided
throw
some
crazy
herbs
in
that
beer
man
and
age
it
in
oak
and
put
a
wave
of
snow
on
the
label
extreme
i
drank
the
other
five
before
this
so
not
awful
but
this
is
an
attempt
to
push
the
style
that
fell
short
throw
in
the
inflated
price
and
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
new
belgium
may
never
blow
you
away
with
their
beers
but
they
constantly
make
quality
session
beers
and
springboard
holds
true
to
that
philosophy
d
i
like
it
light
and
crisp
but
not
lacking
in
character
very
drinkable
opinion
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
am
not
too
find
of
the
balance
i
like
the
blend
of
fruity
flavors
and
how
it
mixes
with
the
hops
but
the
malt
to
back
it
all
up
was
lacking
i
would
think
that
just
attenuating
it
a
bit
less
would
do
the
trick
but
perhaps
an
adjustment
with
dextrine
malt
would
be
preferred
anyway
i
would
like
a
bit
more
substance
d
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
new
belgium
though
it
didnt
start
off
that
way
well
balanced
and
very
very
drinkable
good
drinkability
i
do
like
the
mouthfeel
it
has
theres
plenty
of
budy
to
it
so
you
definately
dont
feel
like
youre
drinking
a
lame
fizzy
yellow
beer
its
a
clever
yeasty
beastie
overall
a
tasty
ale
good
drinkability
it
seemed
surprisingly
wheaty
and
didnt
have
that
strong
new
belgium
malt
flavor
that
seems
to
be
the
same
base
for
all
their
beers
lovely
springtime
ale
this
i
had
a
6pack
without
reviewing
earlier
i
drank
it
so
fast
i
could
like
this
a
lot
thanks
to
rysberg01
for
tossing
this
beer
in
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
the
color
of
straw
really
short
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
thin
cap
smells
fresh
and
grassy
and
somewhat
herbal
plus
aromas
of
lemon
and
wheat
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
an
additional
surprising
herbal
bitterness
that
lingers
crisp
mouthfeel
and
lingering
bitterness
makes
this
somewhat
different
and
refreshing
interesting
and
pretty
enjoyable
the
additional
herbs
really
come
through
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
how
shall
i
say
pleasant
for
lack
of
a
better
term
not
knock
your
socks
off
good
but
all
in
all
drinkable
and
definitely
one
i
will
give
another
try
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
buy
it
again
d
not
too
complex
and
kindof
onedimensional
nevertheless
it
is
still
flavorful
and
very
drinkable

this

is
unique
and
enjoyable

i
enjoyed
it
a

this
reminds
me
alot
of
their

a
good

nothing
amazing

pretty
good

i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
i
am
happy
to
drink
all
of
them
a
nice
spring
beer
from
new
belgium
i
wouldnt
have
more
of
this
beer
i
couldnt
completely
finish
my
16oz
pint
overall
a
rather
drinkable
concoction
from
our
friends
at
new
belgium
first
time
i
tried
this
and
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
id
revisit
this
one
again
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
it
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
which
is
a
very
nice
touch
good
job
new
belgium
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
was
expecting
a
something
different
however
this
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
glad
i
picked
this
up
good
brew
this
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
nice
and
hoppy
with
great
citrus
notes
also
had
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
the
taste
was
a
very
refreshing
bitterness
with
a
nice
maltiness
in
the
front
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
the
beer
was
nice
and
refreshing
great
beer
poured
into
a
session
glass
i
like
the
way
this
looks
golden
but
more
on
the
yellow
side
nice
carbonation
and
head
retention
about
a
solid
12
inch
after
pouring
the
nose
is
initially
malty
followed
by
some
nice
hop
spiciness
even
some
really
faint
citrus
notes
and
then
piney
hop
notes
good
stuff
the
taste
is
good
follows
the
nose
first
malty
sweetness
then
the
hops
kicks
in
followed
by
a
weird
kind
of
bitterness
wormwood
the
mouthfeel
is
unique
dry
finish
with
a
strange
bitterness
i
really
like
this
offering
golden

12
inch
of
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
and
nice
retention
smells
of
floral
hops
and
bits
of
lemon
with
clusters
of
cloves
coriander
and
fresh

the
taste
is
pretty
spicy
slightly
oaky
with
some
pine
hops
lemon
zest
oranges
cloves
all
coming
together
into
a
wellballanced
and
unique
flavor
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
my
kind
of
session
beer
highly
refreshing
and
still
with
unique
flavor
good
beer
medium
body
and
a
bit
on
the
silky
side
finishes
crisp
with
a
spicy
kick
easy
drinking
and
brings
the
thought
of
spring
to
mind
d
this
is
a
pretty
light
beer
from
new
belgium
its
easily
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
a
warm
day
i
can
drink
a
fair
amount
of
this
stuff
as
well
pretty
good
overall
but
not
one
of
their
best
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
mt
hood

very
thirst
quenching
and
not
a
bad
session
beer
at

overall
this
beer
is
very
light
in
color
almost
alarmingly
light
but
the
head
looks
great
and
redeemed
the
appearance
a
bit
this
is
a
good

and
drinkable
did
the
oak
aged
portion
use
of
oats
and
herbs
make
it
a
crazy
good
session
beer
no
would
i
buy
it
again
on
a
hot
day
i
would
certainly
consider
it
d
extremely
drinkable
nice
beer
d
good
for
warm
weather
not
great
for
taste
this
time
around
this
would
be
a
nice
drinker
on
a
hot
day
just
better
than
average
but
it
is
inexpensive
and
readily
available
in
a
lot
of
areas
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
zest
floral
hops
lavender
berries
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
has
more
caramel
than
the
aroma
with
only
hints
of
the
berries
lavender
and
floral
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
which
seems
to
get
in
the
way
a
bit
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
d
overall
i
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
checking
out
sometime
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
a
good
taste
too
the
beer
pours
a
yellowish
color
with
a
lasting
big
head
mostly
transluscent
and
thinnish
looking
smell
is
wheat
and
spices
and
somewhat
witbier
like
taste
is
light
malty
wheaty
and
mild
with
unique
earthy
spices
not
bad
really
but
just
decent
a
nice
white
head
with
medium
to
large
bubbles
the
liquid
is
a
very
light
and
a
tad
cloudy
yellow
with
a
smallish
amount
of
microbubbles
the
aroma
it
gave
off
was
a
pleasant
beery
smell
not
heavy
on
any
particular
ingredient
the
first
taste
gives
forth
a
nice
body
and
a
nice
smooth
taste
not
overbearing
in
any
degree
this
beer
is
similar
but
not
quite
to
others
ive
had
from
new
belgium
the
feel
in
my
mouth
was
one
that
left
my
tongue
wanting
another
sip
ever
so
slightly
dry
this
is
a
nice
well
rounded
beer
with
all
of
its
assets
in
place
and
not
overstated
its
smooth
flavorful
and
has
beer
written
all
over
it
the
head
didnt
dissipate
and
hung
around
til
the
bottom
of
the
mug
along
with
the
bubbles
this
beer
is
great
all
the
way
through
the
sixpack
i
dont
know
that
ill
seek
this
out
but
it
was
interesting
and
drinkable
d
id
definitely
have
another
nice
thirst
quencher
for
nice
weather
this
was
aninteresting
beer
as
i
think
it
is
a
well
crafted
beer
per
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
i
didnt
care
for
the
flavors
they
added
dont
drink
and
review
pours
a
brigt
sunshine
hay
banana
peel
mixture
wih
a
consistant
rush
of
bubbles
and
great
thick
lacing
thathlds
tight
to
the
glass
throughout
he
whole
beer
the
aroma
is
a
dry
blgia
maltwith
a
slight
herbal
hint
along
with
a
yeasty
start
the
tart
is
a
slightly
sweet
yet
dy
pale
malt
with
a
spritz
of
lime
and
herbs
the
finish
is
a
bone
dry
hoppy
splash
mixed
with
that
swet
belgian
malt
flair
a
pretty
bitter
belgian
pale
ale
but
i
love
it
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
love
the
mixing
and
blanding
of
herbs
in
this
brew
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
it
would
work
well
as
a
summer
quencher
also
nice
little
funk
notes
give
it
something
different
than
your
general
blonde
or
pale
ale
d
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
and
enough
happening
to
keep
interest
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
wasnt
outstanding
and
probably
not
going
to
seek
out
again
d
this
one
is
not
for
me
more
of
a
personal
preference
than
anything
else
i
think
the
herbs
just
do
not
agree
with
me
glistening
with
a
bright
white
head
of
onefingers
width
the
color
is
that
of
an
early
harvest
lemon
a
tinge
of
green
atop
a
haze
of
cloudy
yellow
pronounced
lacing
a
light
fresh
smell
smooth
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
crisp
carbonation
to
liven
the
senses
on
a
warm
springs
late
afternoon
no
strong
flavors
a
touch
of
citrus
very
drinkable
but
relatively
unremarkable
d
a
good
beer
with
many
likable
traits
clean
fresh
ontap
east
to
consume
one
ive
had
on
a
few
occasions
pretty
simple
but
very
tasty
do
a
little
magic
with
it
springboard
was
a
real
treat
perfect
for
a
spring
day
in
the
sun
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
you
feel
good
about
it
to
me
this
beer
lost
the
great
aspects
of
either
a
good
belgian
or
a
pale
ale
at
the
cost
of
a
typical
craft
brew
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
unless
i
hear
theyve
gone
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
the
recipe
looks
like
a
wit
pale
creamy
white
body
with
dim
lemon
yellow
shades
pure
white
cap
of
froth
on
top
lacing
is
sufficient
aroma
has
some
wheat
tang
characteristics
and
a
little
lemon
flavor
is
pretty
lifeless
im
not
getting
it
here
whatever
it
is
so
this
beer
is
brewed
with
wormwood
lycium
schisandra
oats
ancient
chinese
herbs
mt
hood
hops
and
2
of
this
ale
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
why
2
the
flavor
is
gritty
and
dirty
not
very
clean
or
refreshing
a
weird
kind
of
dryness
lingers
this
is
not
for
me
glad
i
only
got
a
single
in
the
mouth
is
was
well
carbonated
and
left
a
slight
bitter
mark
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
could
easily
be
a
session
on
a
hot
day
the
beer
settles
in
a
chalice
a
lovely
cloudy
blonde
but
with
a
short
head
that
goes
away
the
aroma
is
made
up
of
assorted
spices
i
cant
put
my
fingers
on
kind
of
tart
and
soury
as
for
the
taste
its
refreshing
and
tastes
um
like
springtime
herbs
and
spice
are
alive
in
the
flavor
and
are
melded
well
into
the
beer
so
then
why
i
am
drinking
this
inside
my
house
im
stepping
outside
for
a
few
minutes
where
i
assume
im
enjoy
this
beer
even
more
yeah
it
was
a
little
more
enjoyable
i
even
picked
up
on
bubblegum
notes
too
this
gets
my
recommendation
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
colour
slightly
hazy
with
an
airy
white
head
with
little
retention
has
a
light
yeasty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
wheat
and
unidentifiable
light
fruits
in
it
taste
is
quite
similar
lightbodied
with
minimal
carbonation
good
abv
and
quite
drinkable
but
like
most
beers
from
n
b
it
fails
to
catch
my
attention
poured
an
extremely
pale
gold
with
a
thick
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
it
dissipated
slowly
and
lacing
lingered
smells
of
floral
and
herbs
taste
is
watery
but
complex
not
that
thats
a
good
thing
more
herbs
than
beer
no
bitterness
to
note
and
a
light
bodied
smooth
beer
that
makes
me
think
this
is
more
a
herb
infused
domestic
light
beer
than
anything
worthwhile
drinkability
easy
try
to
get
this
beer
on
tap
its
pretty
good
d
not
a
bad
offering
from
nb
its
hard
for
me
to
rate
this
because
i
havent
had
much
experience
for
the
style
and
thus
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
something
like
orval
or
leffe
i
could
do
with
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
personally
i
like
the
fact
that
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
hops
i
guess
my
overall
impression
is
that
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
nothing
i
particularly
dislike
but
also
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
for
me
very
light
yellow
and
hazy
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
coriander
but
not
quite
bitter
spices
herbs
flavor
is
a
mix
of
belgian
blonde
and
witbier
but
with
a
mild
and
unpleasant
bitterness
on
the
finish
like
my
primitive
instincts
are
kicking
in
telling
me
that
i
have
poison
in
my
mouth
the
mouth
feel
is
decent
and
although
the
crazy
poison
taste
is
not
always
present
on
each
sip
it
shows
up
enough
to
mar
its
drinkability
maybe
this
could
be
a
hybrid
east
meets
west
crazy
cure
for
a
disease
i
hope
never
gets
discovered
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
nice
snowy
white
head
its
nose
wasnt
strong
at
all
but
i
did
get
notes
of
lemony
citrus
poking
through
but
nothing
too
prominent
the
beers
taste
definitely
had
a
grainy
taste
with
herbal
notes
in
the
back
finished
a
little
dry
and
tart
mouthfeel
was
crisp
not
a
bad
beer
by
no
means
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
flavor
up
front
hazy
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
head
of
bright
white
foam
lots
of
sticky
lacing
and
great
head
retention
spicy
hop
aroma
a
bit
yeasty
and
earthy
fruity
peach
a
bit
of
cereal
mild
flavour
with
a
bit
of
fruit
up
front
malt
sweetness
floral
hops
kick
in
finishes
with
peach
and
spicy
hops
very
mellow
creamy
carbonation
with
a
light
airy
texture
not
very
crisp
but
good
mouthfeel
a
bit
drying
really
tasty
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
and
refreshing
flavour
that
i
quite
enjoyed
drinkability
this
beer
is
above
average
and
crisp
but
it
doesnt
do
enough
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
very
herbal
especially
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
bright
lemongrass
and
a
bit
of
oakwood
extremly
refreshing
and
bright
great
for
a
camping
trip
in
the
summer
or
a
nice
spring
drinker
dont
save
this
one
until
winter
drink
it
now
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
which
i
had
to
warm
by
hand
stupid
iced
glasses
the
color
was
bright
whiteyellow
and
reminded
me
of
their
wit
beer
hazy
it
had
a
funky
yeasty
smell
to
it
the
flavor
was
odd
herbs
no
oakiness
which
is
not
surprising
given
that
only
2
was
oakaged
interesting
beer
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
one
serving
is
enough
thanks
younger35
for
the
opportunity
i
greatly
appreciate
this
site
and
have
had
several
of
new
belgiums
beers
but
this
one
isnt
doing
much
for
me
tastes
like
detox
tea
maybe
it
would
go
good
with
sushi
the
body
is
light
and
finishes
a
touch
dry
some
silky
or
wheaty
characteristic
for
a
smooth
finish
carbonation
is
a
light
for
style
but
still
helps
the
orange
zest
finish
overall
its
a
bottle
conditioned
new
belgian
beer
kind
of
like
a
spiced
up
unfiltered
sunshine
wheat
crisp
and
mellow
easy
to
drink
but
your
mouth
doesnt
feel
much
going
on
overall
a
good
beer
and
worth
the
9
bucks
for
the
sixer
perfect
for
one
of
those
spring
days
when
the
weather
is
warming
up
and
youre
like
damn
its
hot
today
even
though
its
only
70
degrees
overall
i
am
usually
excited
to
try
something
new
from
new
belgium
since
fat
tire
was
my
gateway
beer
i
guess
i
just
have
some
respect
for
the
brewery
i
was
happy
with
this
one
i
will
buy
it
again
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
new
belgium
snifter
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
haziness
with
a
thick
head
with
lacing
smell
is
off
lemon
spice
and
slight
yeast
aroma
taste
is
medicinal
spiced
with
lemon
zest
earthy
overtones
and
a
slight
tannic
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
body
crisp
and
dry
with
a
mild
carbonation
level
pretty
easy
to
drink
taste
this
is
a
fun
drinking
beer
the
spices
and
yeast
add
a
complexity
to
the
candy
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
id
definitely
buy
this
again
maybe
not
the
best
representation
of
a
belgian
but
certainly
a
good
brew
a
nice
aroma
of
fuit
sweetness
mineral
bready
maltyness
and
fresh
spring
water
flavor
is
quite
interresting
it
first
seems
simplistic
as
it
hits
of
with
a
very
traditional
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
hop
bitterness
but
then
it
takes
of
with
a
lingering
biterness
that
is
not
quite
like
hops
more
like
a
herb
kinda
like
pissenlit
stems
without
being
overwhelming
it
ends
on
a
fruity
note
that
invites
a
new
sip
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
modeled
after
the
westmalle
bottle
a
very
unique
highly
drinkable
pale
i
dont
think
ive
experienced
a
sub
par
product
from
new
belgium
in
my
life
and
this
is
no
exception
definitely
my
favorite
session
beer
as
of
late
almost
as
unfilling
as
a
commercial
light
lager
very
recomended
nice
clear
golden
amber
color
on
the
pour
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
the
head
a
good
two
fingers
in
size
and
a
creamy
bright
white
retention
is
good
with
the
resultant
lace
a
fine
velum
like
sheet
nose
has
hints
of
earthiness
linked
to
the
sweet
malt
crisp
and
sparkling
fruit
like
tones
id
say
peaches
start
has
a
sweet
malt
front
with
a
pleasant
tangy
bite
at
the
back
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
sparkling
acidity
the
hops
pleasingly
spicy
the
dry
long
lasting
aftertaste
seals
the
deal
another
fine
beer
from
a
superb
brewery
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
good
representation
of
style
but
seems
to
lean
toward
the
witbier
style
good
kick
nice
beer
to
drink
for
an
evening
but
despite
the
qualities
that
make
it
different
i
still
might
look
for
something
else
after
a
while
would
drink
more
if
i
found
them
didnt
start
out
that
well
but
a
good
beer
overall
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
i
dont
get
anything
too
compelling
in
this
beer
the
flavor
seems
absent
and
certainly
isnt
complex
or
distinctive
by
any
means
safe
to
say
i
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
not
sure
about
this
beer
doesnt
really
have
much
flavor
going
on
and
leaves
a
ruddled
gritty
film
on
my
tongue
on
the
finish
grassy
light
melon
flavors
thin
mouth
light
spice
and
herbal
quality
slight
belgian
yeast
flavors
i
guess
these
could
be
good
on
a
warm
day
but
otherwise
something
im
not
diggin
this
beer
was
a
little
unique
it
poured
nice
and
light
golden
colored
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
faintly
of
wheat
but
i
focused
more
on
the
citrus
malt
which
was
distinct
for
me
the
taste
was
ok
with
no
off
flavors
but
overall
a
little
light
there
was
some
orange
citrus
along
with
some
yeast
and
grass
flavors
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
were
good
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
simply
outstanding
about
it
all
in
all
a
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
hey
you
pass
me
down
that
bottle
drinkability
is
good
a
simple
and
enjoyable
beer
with
no
noticeable
flaws
went
great
with
my
burger
and
fries
like
i
said
def
not
for
everyone
but
i
really
did
enjoy
it
very
interesting
yet
appropriate
for
spring
seasonal
kudos
on
a
wellmade
beer
and
for
trying
something
this
adventurous
tastes
great
extremely
light
finish
closes
pretty
quickly
with
a
grainy
dryness
not
a
lot
of
flavor
in
here
but
incredibly
drinkable
herbal
infousion
flavors
arent
very
dicernable
by
my
palette
but
i
think
they
are
playing
a
big
part
in
balancing
this
out
given
how
little
hop
flavor
is
present
thanks
to
talisker
for
the
extra
pours
a
very
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
of
some
pale
malts
and
berries
but
somewhat
weak
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
hefeweizen
with
slightly
stronger
hop
presence
the
berries
provide
an
interesting
aspect
however
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
and
youd
never
guess
it
was
6
2
this
is
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
just
nothing
spectacular
went
down
smooth
and
easy
i
recommend
this
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
and
tastey
slick
mouthfeel
with
prickly
carbonation
a
little
too
complex
for
an
all
daynight
affair
interesting
beer
d
the
flavor
is
interesting
and
smooth
but
there
is
not
really
much
character
the
hops
have
a
nice
pungent
musty
hint
that
would
be
nice
to
taste
more
of
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
mediumthin
body
good
cold
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
not
the
best
from
new
begium
but
not
bad
at
all
d
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
too
much
it
had
an
interesting
taste
but
not
one
that
i
really
could
say
i
enjoyed
d
i
bet
this
beer
is
down
right
downable
on
a
hot
summer
day
bit
too
sweet
though
for
major
pounding
think
could
really
only
do
three
or
four
in
a
sitting
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
quick
fading
head
not
a
lot
of
smell
slight
citrus
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
wheatmalt
tastes
a
little
sour
up
front
with
a
lime
flavor
followed
by
the
crisp
wheat
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
new
spring
ale
that
bluemooncoors
is
making
this
beer
is
lighter
and
the
flavors
blend
better
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
much
prefer
their
wit
over
this
kudos
to
new
belgian
for
making
something
interesting
and
creative
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
but
i
am
glad
i
sampled
it
and
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
denver
airport
it
was
served
too
cold
to
get
a
good
smell
i
picked
up
bit
of
lemon
the
body
was
cloudy
yellow
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
left
lacing
all
down
the
glass
the
taste
was
tart
lemony
with
some
orange
and
a
herbal
hop
flavor
to
finish
it
finished
very
dry
and
refreshing
it
had
a
smooth
creamy
body
a
very
refreshing
beer
the
area
where
this
beer
really
shines
is
in
the
drinkability
department
this
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
and
an
excellent
choice
for
a
brunch
beer
or
a
light
lunch
nice
golden
color
with
white
head
that
leaves
thin
white
lace
from
beginning
to
end
smells
clean
and
yummy
fruity
citrusy
nice
clean
taste
fruity
and
a
bit
of
citrus
very
refreshing
feels
nice
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
another
fine
beer
by
new
belgium
wish
i
could
get
this
here
in
florida
i
would
love
to
enjoy
it
more
often
this
is
highly
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
clean
finish
however
the
abv
is
higher
then
you
can
taste
and
its
not
so
tasty
that
you
just
cant
get
enough
nice
hot
day
bbq
beer
perhaps
although
we
dont
really
have
those
yet
out
west
in
the
springtime
so
for
the
season
i
wouldve
liked
more
umph
interesting
but
not
one
of
nb
best
efforts
this
is
ok
i
dont
think
i
would
get
it
again
this
is
sessionable
a
little
better
on
tap
not
too
tasty
but
easy
to
drink
taste
is
sour
and
stale
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
light
in
body
and
mouthfeel
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
one
since
i
like
most
other
new
belgium
offerings
i
say
pass
on
this
one
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
on
the
label
was
a
light
golden
color
with
very
small
head
that
quickly
went
away
the
smell
was
very
offputting
and
had
me
worried
its
an
exotic
brew
with
goji
berries
wormwood
and
schisandra
not
sure
which
one
dominated
the
smell
but
it
was
not
good
the
taste
was
horrendous
again
not
sure
which
one
is
the
culprit
but
disgusting
very
bitter
and
acidic
from
start
to
finish
the
acidity
actually
gets
worse
after
you
drink
and
keeps
on
building
i
dont
mind
bitter
but
acidic
and
whatever
flavorings
are
dominating
ruin
this
i
love
almost
anything
that
nbb
puts
out
but
this
one
is
terrible
i
cant
think
of
a
single
positive
attribute
to
this
one
drain
pour
highly
highly
dont
recommend
0
na
ml
n
d
typical
of
the
new
belgium
brewing
traits
that
run
throughout
most
of
their
brews
quite
tasty
once
you
get
used
to
hoppy
flavor
nice
drinkability
perfectly
acceptable
brew
put
out
here
from
nb
pretty
much
to
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
seasonal
ones
ive
had
overall
visually
a
dud
for
me
scent
almost
resulted
in
a
drain
pour
taste
a
bit
better
but
not
something
ill
be
back
for
i
could
be
talked
into
trying
it
again
but
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinker
no
doubt
but
i
wonder
how
it
will
treat
me
near
the
end
of
my
session
only
one
way
to
find
out
mouth
peach
and
cherry
cool
bitterness
that
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
hops
something
i
cant
place
but
similar
to
the
skin
between
grapefruit
sections
probably
due
to
one
of
the
bizarre
flavorants
of
this
beer
good
malt
body
some
toastiness
pretty
interesting
goes
down
easy
but
not
too
great
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
carbonated
enjoyable
drinkability
perfectly
acceptable
brew
put
out
here
from
nb
pretty
much
to
style
and
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
seasonal
ones
ive
had
a
whiter
shade
of
pale
with
a
bountiful
head
nose
is
citrusy
and
very
springlike
and
outdoorsy
with
belgian
esters
aplenty
the
taste
is
very
saisonal
and
pleasing
but
wheres
the
gogi
berries
and
all
the
other
chinese
spices
that
were
supposed
to
be
present
i
would
have
given
it
a
4
5
otherwise
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
very
high
notes
another
odd
beer
from
a
brewer
that
seems
to
use
a
similar
malt
type
in
almost
all
of
its
offerings
this
one
i
could
enjoy
partly
because
there
is
a
delightfull
fruitiness
that
is
interesting
and
its
crisp
enough
for
a
hot
day
that
being
said
its
a
beer
ill
pass
on
new
belgium
always
has
some
solid
brews
this
is
just
another
example
to
add
to
the
list
recommended
overall
impression
definitely
a
different
kind
of
beer
a
nice
one
to
sip
while
waiting
to
spring
forward
new
belgium
took
a
risk
with
this
one
and
i
dig
it
not
going
to
be
my
favorite
beer
but
ill
have
no
troubles
with
the
6
pack
give
it
a
shot
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
a
while
and
finally
picked
up
a
bottle
pours
a
bright
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
little
white
head
that
setttles
quickly
smells
a
bit
fruity
but
not
excessively
so
that
could
be
the
goji
berries
perhaps
also
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
non
hoppy
sourness
feels
a
bit
thicker
in
the
mouth
than
the
color
would
lead
you
to
expect
but
that
may
be
due
to
the
oats
used
in
the
recipe
all
around
this
is
a
very
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
or
sour
or
bitter
a
very
well
balanced
brew
ill
have
to
definetly
pick
up
some
more
of
this
its
quite
good
pale
lemon
gold
with
a
slight
haze
chunky
bright
white
head
that
transforms
into
a
puck
of
big
bubbled
foam
depositing
bands
of
fine
lace
slow
moving
tails
of
carbonation
rise
aromas
are
light
and
of
white
fleshed
fruits
a
bit
of
lemon
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
starts
a
bit
sweet
with
a
soft
smooth
body
some
ripe
pear
flesh
fills
in
the
middle
and
an
gentle
herbal
hop
element
carries
through
the
finish
which
has
a
nice
crispness
that
makes
this
highly
drinkable
a
lemoncitric
tartness
that
is
also
slightly
medicinal
becomes
evident
as
it
warms
slightly
further
increasing
the
drinkability
mediumlight
body
with
fine
carbonation
the
label
indicates
that
goji
berries
wormwood
and
schisandra
were
used
and
while
i
have
no
idea
what
they
specifically
taste
like
they
worked
well
super
sessionable
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poures
a
light
straw
forming
a
very
thin
head
and
leaving
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
hint
of
light
fruit
followed
by
the
citrus
aroma
of
the
hops
the
taste
is
exactly
what
i
imagined
the
style
would
taste
like
there
is
more
of
a
sweetness
to
this
style
with
less
of
a
bite
from
the
hops
i
makes
for
a
smooth
fruity
citrus
finish
light
mouthfeel
this
is
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
definitely
a
style
worth
exploring
d
this
one
is
fairly
drinkable
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
malty
witbeer
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
is
the
very
grainy
finish
after
each
sip
nonetheless
it
is
a
quality
brew
and
its
too
bad
it
doesnt
come
out
in
the
summer
just
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
springboard
at
mr
liquor
in
carpinteria
ca
usa
and
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
good
good
stuff
its
got
a
pale
hazy
yellow
body
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
nose
has
a
strong
lemon
scent
youd
expect
a
sharply
sour
acidic
taste
from
the
smell
of
it
but
the
flavor
while
being
heavy
on
the
citrus
side
is
not
sharp
or
bitter
at
all
its
very
smooth
like
a
grapefruit
juice
without
the
bitter
tangy
taste
goes
down
super
easy
nice
clean
crisp
refreshing
drink
great
for
the
summer
the
taste
of
mild
hops
with
a
hint
of
grains
was
all
i
got
out
of
this
ale
it
would
have
been
better
tasting
but
it
was
a
little
flat
with
hardly
any
bitterness
it
lacked
balance
for
a
pale
ale
there
was
just
something
missing
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
bright
yellow
in
appearance
with
a
1
inch
head
a
slight
tart
or
lemony
smell
with
the
usual
smells
of
a
lighter
ale
or
lager
at
first
taste
you
get
the
flow
of
sweetness
and
refreshment
that
is
springboard
next
sip
you
get
the
complexity
of
this
beer
it
kinda
fools
you
because
each
taste
thereafter
you
get
something
different
good
lacing
throughout
i
was
just
thinking
how
much
i
enjoy
the
seasonal
beers
that
are
put
out
by
nbb
fc
is
the
place
to
be
d
i
wasnt
a
fan
after
the
first
bottle
but
the
second
was
a
lot
more
enjoyable
i
really
liked
the
way
the
beer
went
through
3
distinct
stages
tart
to
grainy
to
dry
over
the
course
of
each
mouthful
though
i
was
wishing
for
a
bit
of
sweetness
at
first
i
came
to
realize
that
there
just
isnt
any
room
for
that
in
this
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
purchased
from
the
north
coast
coop
in
eureka
ca
poured
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
large
and
very
foamy
white
head
that
diminished
fairly
quickly
and
left
moderate
lacing
nose
is
mostly
hops
with
a
little
citrus
that
seems
mostly
lemon
or
grapefruit
spices
and
flowers
body
is
surprisingly
rich
and
flavor
is
a
combination
of
hops
and
some
odd
spices
i
cannot
identify
it
is
supposed
to
contain
wormwood
and
maybe
that
contributes
to
the
sligthly
bitter
touch
that
does
not
seem
like
hops
that
shows
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
and
if
you
approach
it
with
that
expectation
it
is
ok
basically
this
is
a
decent
brew
with
a
very
unique
bouquet
and
flavor
you
have
to
give
new
belgium
credit
for
experimenting
ill
stick
with
the
nb
saison
d
light
and
springlike
but
not
especially
tasty
or
sweet
perhaps
a
good
palate
cleanser
had
a
chance
to
sample
this
at
a
tasting
at
the
home
of
phatz
and
grace
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
smells
of
spicy
ginger
root
coriander
and
lemon
tastes
of
lemony
hops
with
a
spicy
yeasty
mildly
alcoholic
note
crisp
and
dry
in
the
mouth
with
medium
to
moderate
carbonation
not
really
a
beer
i
would
hunt
down
but
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
this
is
one
easy
to
drink
beer
right
now
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
think
this
beer
would
be
better
in
the
summer
especially
after
mowing
the
lawndoing
yard
work
drinks
very
easy
an
interesting
if
not
dead
true
style
take
on
belgian
pas
a
one
they
want
to
consider
as
a
summer
seasonal
vice
skinny
dip
as
i
believe
this
would
go
down
like
water
during
summer
cheers
drinkability
good
i
was
very
shock
that
i
loved
this
beer
so
much
the
first
swallow
was
kind
of
odd
after
a
few
more
i
realize
that
this
was
a
prize
winner
in
my
eyes
i
have
already
purchase
more
of
this
seasonal
wonder
crisp
finish
not
a
bad
brew
perhaps
released
a
bit
early
in
the
year
id
wait
until
the
weather
is
a
bit
more
constant
warmer
that
is
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
bad
for
the
style
though
i
dont
see
where
it
was
going
to
me
its
almost
like
a
hoppy
lager
like
sam
adams
boston
or
something
like
that
not
a
lot
going
on
doesnt
really
stand
out
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
its
interesting
but
in
an
interesting
sort
of
way
not
an
exceedingly
tasty
way
hazy
straw
colour
in
the
glass
thick
fluffy
and
foamy
white
head
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
pretty
heavy
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
a
mix
of
straw
yeast
and
pepper
aromas
grassy
lemon
and
spicy
flavours
pretty
full
mouthfeel
finishes
very
dry
with
an
odd
lingering
and
bitter
aftertaste
worth
trying
but
probably
wont
be
drinking
a
lot
of
it
may
be
better
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
then
an
early
spring
seasonal
d
a
very
tasty
beer
and
unlike
anything
else
ive
ever
had
this
isnt
the
tastiest
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
have
to
give
credit
to
the
amount
of
creativity
in
this
beer
that
creates
good
complexity
its
a
sweet
and
malty
beer
recommended
highly
recommended
lightmedium
body
with
an
effervescent
feel
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
an
exceptional
beer
complex
and
refreshing
nice
dry
finish
great
head
and
retention
in
the
tulip
glass
nice
yeasty
aroma
banaa
phenol
taste
is
nice
and
has
a
lot
of
underlying
complexities
that
are
well
balanced
a
little
cloviness
good
crisp
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
neat
beer
kindof
average
all
around
but
the
herbs
in
this
beer
arent
for
the
first
time
drinker
nor
for
those
who
dont
like
random
herbs
prost
pours
out
a
hazy
gold
with
tons
of
carbonation
in
the
body
a
thick
fluffy
eggshell
head
that
forms
plateaus
and
dips
and
thick
raised
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
mix
of
pale
malts
spicy
yet
subdued
belgian
yeast
light

fruits

taste
is
crisp
pale
malts
some
grain
some
light
fruit
herbs
and
spice
finishes
dry
and
the
aftertaste
is
crackerlike
mouthfeel
leans
toward
full
which
i
guess
could
be
attributed
to
the
oats
and
the
carbonation
is
soft
solid
drinkability
but
i
dont
think
i
could
make
a
session
out
of
this
i
thought
this
beer
seemed
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
was
simple
without
being
boring
in
a
way
i
like
the
way
new
belgium
are
approaching
their
seasonals
not
overpowering
easy
to
drink
brews
unfortunately
i
have
yet
to
be
truly
wowed
by
anything
they
have
come
out
with
recently
either
definitely
worth
trying
last
swigs
a
little
too
spicy
to
be
a
session
beer
but
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
go
with
a
spicy
chicken
or
pork
i
would
imagine
a
welcome
changeup
beer
thanks
to
intriqken
for
the
gift
im
not
sure
what
this
is
sort
of
a
american
macro
crossed
with
a
belgium
pale
strange
not
bad
just
strange
ale
brewed
with
wormwoodgoji
berries
and
schisandra
well
should
be
intresting
as
i
have
no
earthly
idea
what
these
things
taste
like
well
the
appearance
is
rather
limp
pale
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
more
livelly
with
some
ginger
aspects
citric
in
character
and
some
fruity
tones
very
balanced
and
unexpectedly
thick
flavours
given
the
appearance
i
suppose
the
oats
lend
to
the
slickness
and
the
herbs
certainlly
leave
a
strange
medicinalbitter
flavour
underneath
weak
hopping
though
they
do
show
up
in
the
after
taste
rather
odd
and
full
on
the
palte
low
carbonation
a
rather
strange
beer
but
i
liked
it
quite
drinkable
actually
reminded
me
a
bit
of
mateveza
by
butte
creek
it
was
brewed
with
mate
yerba
purchase
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
best
before
15jun07
so
its
good
for
quite
sometime
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
there
is
a
huge
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
fruity
yeast
sweet
bananas
and
a
little
spice
taste
is
of
sweet
bananas
and
that
belgian
funk
this
gives
way
to
a
berry
flavor
perhaps
the
goji
berries
this
is
brewed
with
although
i
am
unfamiliar
with
this
berry
also
known
as
the
wolfberry
according
to
my
research
and
there
is
a
spice
present
throughout
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
although
i
would
prefer
a
little
less
carbonation
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinker
pretty
soild
effort
from
new
belgium
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
that
i
know
ill
drink
more
of
i
recommend
it
12
oz
bottle
color
of
hazy
yellow
with
a
frothy
head
nose
of
i
have
no
ideal
what
a
goji
berry
smells
like
however
it
has
a
crisp
wheat
nose

taste
of
wheat
hay
dry
straw
lemon
zest
and
citrus
hopps
body
light
medium
carbonation
and
acidic

aftertaste
of
sour
and
acidic
long
lasting
overall
impression
complex
and
layered
yet
very
drinkable
this
beers
flavor
profile
goes
up
a
staircase
of
aromas
flavors
mouthfeels
and
body

its
like
taking
an
amusement
park
ride
the
beer
mimics
a
journey
through
spring

it
starts
out
in
front
of
a
warm
fireplace
and
ends
up
in
a
green
fresh
meadow
heavy
enough
to
drink
in
feb
yet
light
enough
to
enjoy
in
april
overall
impression
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
this
one
is
a
bit
dangerous
with
session
beer
drinkability
in
a
6
2
abv
i
went
through
a
growler
of
this
one
before
it
was
released
in
bottles
and
will
probably
make
it
through
quite
a
few
bottles
this
spring
when
nb
announced
they
were
revamping
the
seasonals
i
was
a
bit
worried
but
so
far
they
have
impressed
big
thanks
to
gbontrag
for
this
one
easy
to
drink
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unsettling
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
im
guessing
its
one
of
those
unique
ingredients
cheers
to
nb
for
going
out
and
doing
something
different
and
ill
probably
have
this
one
again
but
im
not
100
sure
why
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
much
about
the
style
but
this
beer
is
ok
not
the
best
of
the
new
belgium
line
im
afraid
abv
is
a
little
high
is
to
be
sessionable
nice
yellow
edges
and
a
center
that
was
just
slightly
hazy
in
the
glass
head
was
big
and
bubbly
but
not
too
thick
the
smell
was
light
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
apple
dried
fruits
and
almost
a
nutmeg
mouthfeel
was
light
and
real
wet
but
it
begged
to
be
swallowed
quickly
it
was
hard
to
not
drink
the
whole
beer
in
one
drink
tastes
are
real
mellow
and
hard
to
miss
with
the
drinkabilty
fruit
is
the
first
thing
i
can
think
of
it
almost
has
a
metalic
taste
to
the
back
and
it
all
blends
well
i
supose
another
seasonal
from
new
belgium
i
dont
think
i
buy
this
beer
but
for
the
style
i
supose
it
is
ok
be
careful
slow
down
dont
swallow
the
whole
thing
definately
worth
trying
but
get
a
single
instead
of
a
sixer
palate
is
light
and
herby
up
front
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
imparted
perhaps
by
the
goji
berries
light
herbs
wormwood
i
guess
a
little
thyme
come
through
before
the
swallow
with
a
light
citrusy
finish
body
is
rather
spritzy
and
very
refreshing
wasnt
sure
how
id
like
something
like
this
but
i
think
it
may
be
a
great
springtime
thirst
quencher
if
only
the
weather
would
warm
up
a
little
while
its
still
on
the
shelves
d
it
is
very
tasty
and
will
probably
buy
a
6pack
of
this
when
it
comes
out
i
really
wish
i
could
taste
all
the
things
in
it
individually
so
i
have
a
better
idea
of
the
flavors
going
on
all
in
all
its
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
md
body
and
mildly
carbonated
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzyfoamy
head
which
lasts
alittle
while
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
of
malt
hops
yeast
and
spices
according
to
the
bottle
ale
brewed
with
wormwood
goji
berries
and
schisandra
the
taste
is
crisp
slightly
bitter
yeasty
spicy
and
hoppy
slightly
dry
finish
lightmedium
body
very
drinkable
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
would
recommend
oprobably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
this
year
all
i
can
think
of
was
that
it
was
old
stock
but
it
was
horrible

o
loft
has
suggestions
of
fruit
complexity
but
at
its
core
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
rather
simple
pale
ale
that
wishes
to
provide
crisp
refreshment
for
the
hotter
days
of
the
year
and
it
certainly
does
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
peppery
and
floral
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
floral
and
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smells
are
fairly
faint
in
my
opinion
o
light
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
day
flavors
are
approachable
an
easy
drinking
beer
though
with
some
subtle
complexities
if
one
takes
the
time
to
appreciate
them
t
sweet
breadiness
but
not
overly
so
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
good
but
not
great
i
feel
like
new
belgium
should
keep
this
one
out
this
was
apart
of
the
revival
series
it
taste
similar
to
fat
tire
if
you
takeout
the
caramel
notes
and
sweeter
notes
that
fat
tire
has
poured
a
cloudy
yet
transparent
amber
with
a
half
finger
white
head
pretty
nice
looking
standard
but
not
horrible
scents
of
slight
tropical
fruit
some
sweet
malt
and
very
slight
citrus
and
pine
okay
nothing
offensive
but
very
light
flavor
is
light
with
hints
of
floral
hops
predominating
with
a
bit
of
wheat
cracker
slight
citrus
peel
and
that
earthy
dirty
new
belgium
yeast
its
a
very
light
flavor
to
be
sure
but
its
not
bad
good
for
a
light
session
beer
like
this
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
fairly
high
carbonation
again
a
light
sessionable
sort
of
mouthfeel
overall
its
decent
enough
nothing
id
seek
out
but
good
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
kinda
boring
really
pours

with
an
average

tastes
of

pale

hops
lemon
and
a
hint

overall
decent

the

is
good

to
a

a
lemony
grassy

flavor
finishes
off
the
palate
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
just
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
d
easy

overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
really
great
or
bad
clear
gold
in
color
forms
a
moderate
fluffy
white
head
but
it
doesnt
bother
sticking
around
for
too
long
as
it
reduces
to
a
thick
patchy
surface
coating
aroma
is
light
but
pleasant
biscuity
malt
some
grassiness
and
a
pronounced
floral
quality
taste
is
unique
and
not
in
a
good
way
strong
overpowering
floral
taste

camomile

something
gives
this
beer
a
string

almost
unbearable

light
body
minimal
bitterness
appropriate
carbonation
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
belgian
pale
as
it
really
doesnt
resemble
one
in
the
least
in
all
fairness
the
bottle
doesnt
claim
this
is
a
belgian
pale
never
the
less
this
is
a
barely
drinkable
beer
overall
a
solid
and
sessionworthy
but
ultimately
forgettable
beer
c
o
great
summer
session
beer
too
light
for
my
usual
taste
though
it
reminded
of
a
light
beer
in
some
ways
but
enhanced
to
try
to
give
it
some
depth
not
bad
all
in
all
but
this
would
leave
me
wanting
more
if
i
just
had
one
of
these
taste
packs
alot
of
maltiness
for
such
a
light
brew
and
the
hops
are
adequate
especially
on
the
bittering
side
yeast
is
still
lacking
for
a
belgian
pa
but
there
might
be
a
light
applenut
contribution
here
mouthfeel
is
expectedly
light
being
a
session
ale
and
all
not
bad
it
was
nice
to
have
this
again
it
must
be
at
least
5
or
6
years
since
this
was
last
around
but
it
doesnt
taste
as
rich
and
yeasty
as
i
remember
tastes
lightly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
with
the
volume
turned
down
low
a
touch
of
biscuit
malt
rounds
this
out
with
an
uninteresting
finish
while
this
may
make
a
nice
summer
beer
it
doesnt
do
the
trick
for
this
session
o
this
beer
is
basically
just
water
nothing
special
here
maybe
this
is
a
recipe
that
should
have
stayed
hidden
final
thoughts
im
not
sure
i
agree
with
classifying
loft
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
because
i
didnt
get
any
spice
notes
in
the
palate
a
more
fitting
style
might
be
session
pale
ale
its
light
moderately
hoppy
and
refreshing
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
onothing
bad
as
far
as
flavor
goes
but
just
bland
boring
nothingness
surprised
at
how
much
this
beer
grew
on
me
its
simple
on
the
outside
but
improves
as
it
goes
down
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
just
a
hint
of
amber
solid
two
fingers
of
white
head
okay
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
has
fruit
lemongrass
and
vanilla
a
light
tasting
beer
that
is
crisp
and
mildly
fruity
light
hops
has
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
to
see
if
it
grows
on
me
definitely
one
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
a
light
grassy
and
lemon
beer
for
hot
weather
nothing
spectacular
price
point
a
little
high
for
the
lack
of
ingredients
or
process
though
would
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
substance
regardless
of
the
weather
this
is
a
special
brew
meant
to
provide
a
light
drinking
experience
basically
it
delivers
what
it
promises
and
gives
an
easy
drinking
lighter
brew
though
it
has
to
be
one
of
if
not
the
lightest
belgian
pale
ales
around
i
was
surprised
at
how
light
it
really
was
and
how
it
did
kind
of
lift
my
palate
up
even
though
i
tend
to
go
for
heavier
stuff
i
have
to
say
that
i
still
like
this
one
because
of
its
even
style
even
though
it
is
lighter
light
orange
clean
balanced
but
subtle
aroma
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
hoppy
and
fruity
the
flavor
delivers
a
very
nice
citrus
and
fruit
taste
from
the
hops
the
added
lime
leaves
add
a
touch
of
lime
flavor
a
nice
american
wheat
ale
with
a
broad
range
of
flavors
but
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
in
the
belgian
mold
to
me
nice
summer
beer
thicker
than
water
with
taste
opinion
well
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
it
has
some
pretty
good
flavor
but
it
is
obvious
that
this
wasnt
meant
to
knock
you
down
it
would
probably
go
pretty
well
with
a
cold
basket
of
fruit
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
rather
use
a
barley
wine
for
this
purpose
so
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
this
all
too
often
ok
i
was
just
kidding
about
the
barley
wine
but
it
is
still
one
i
probably
wont
drink
too
often
notes
a
very
good
beer
to
be
drinking
over
the
summer
or
as
a
session
beer
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
a
little
too
bland
for
my
taste
not
nbs
best
by
a
long
shot
but
not
their
worst
give
it
a
try
this
should
be
an
excellent
hot
weather
thirst
quencher
but
good
anytime
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
subtle
beer
and
very
well
balanced
considering
how
delicate
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
it
would
make
an
excellent
summer
beer
very
nice
poured
into
an

brew
not
all
brews
need

make
you

are

for
drinking

particularly
well
very
thin

is
unimpressive
but
not
a
clue
to
the
beer
as
a
whole
which
is
good
the
smell
is
very
herbal
and
organic
some
fruity
undertones
and
hops
ring
through
the
taste
is
very
pleasent
smooth
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
some
hop
character
in
the
finish
a
bit
over
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
unimpressive
and
watery
much
like
the
pour
i
like
this
beer
as
a
drinkable
one
because
i
can
give
it
to
a
fan
of
boulevard
or
bmc
and
they
might
drink
it
and
like
it
this
is
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
in
quantity
and
quality
will
buy
again
for
stocking
in
the
fridge
for
all
occasions
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
crisp
grassycitrus
hops
were
very
enjoyable
though
a
bit
average
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
though
this
made
it
quite
drinkable
loft
pours
a
crisp
golden
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
is
thin
but
does
stick
aroun
for
quite
some
time
aroma
is
yeasty
to
say
the
least
but
the
yeast
has
some
pleasant
pepperygrassy
notes
that
balance
the
slight
hints
of
caramelish
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
too
thin
for
me
sweet
malt
slides
right
over
the
tongue
leading
to
a
grassy
middle
before
being
punctuated
by
a
sharp
hop
bite
that
is
without
a
lot
of
character
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
for
my
taste
as
well
usually
im
a
fan
of
new
belgiums
brews
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
bring
on
the
frambozen
ive
enjoyed
other
beers
by
nbb
but
this
is
not
a
beer
ill
be
having
for
a
while
may
need
to
try
at
a
later
date
might
not
be
world
class
but
i
like
it
nice
enjoyable
pale
here
thanks
go
to
dertbert
for
this
sample
ok
so
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
really
really
bland
the
taste
is
a
light
sweet
malt
if
someone
handed
me
this
on
a
hot
day
i
wouldnt
say
no
im
just
amazed
by
the
complete
lack
of
substance
to
this
beer
come
on
new
beligum
ditch
this
dud
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
however
this
brew
just
really
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
much
too
nondescript
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
it
out
again
thanks
to
mentor
for
the
sample
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
new
belgum
in
general
but
am
definatly
not
impressed
by
loft
i
was
poured
a
pint
by
an
excelant
beerbarman
but
the
loft
did
not
produce
an
adequate
head
its
nose
is
very
faint
and
slightly
sour
the
body
is
light
almost
watery
sweet
grain
flavor
with
strawberry
notes
on
the
up
side
its
rather
easy
to
drink
but
thats
mostly
because
there
is
not
too
much
to
it
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
orange
very
nice
color
head
is
very
small
and
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
excellent
even
though
it
is
quite
faint
i
can
smell
the
fruit
kind
of
an
orangey
lemony
smell
its
great
compared
to
fat
tires
smell
i
absolutely
love
the
taste
tastes
kind
of
lemony
at
the
first
wave
and
then
turns
nice
and
malty
at
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
quite
interesting
because
it
leaves
a
taste
like
fresh
buttery
cornonthecob
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
hops
are
quite
light
and
not
overpowering
at
all
this
in
turn
makes
it
very
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
beer
drinkability
light
refreshing
beer
with
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
one
a
dangerously
quaffable
summer
beer
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
another
worth
trying
at
least
once
a
pleasing
light
orange
in
color
18th
of
an
inch
white
ring
fair
lacing
biscuits
and
underlying
malts
with
hints
of
lemon
peel
and
grass
on
the
nose
up
top
very
rich
zesty
and
creamy
has
a
sweetsour
feel
to
it
medium
burnt
toast
like
flavorings
coupled
with
some
grain
and
wheat
has
qualities
like
its
fattire
brother
a
decent
and
refreshing
offering
loft
is
a
good
summer
session
beer
at
4
or
4
2
these
go
down
pretty
easy
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
95
degree
north
carolina
day
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
the
beer
but
solid
and
does
what
its
meant
to
do
nice
golden
color
white
head
there
was
about
a
14
inch
head
immediately
after
pouring
and
this
was
gone
within
a
minute
leaving
slight
white
lacing
around
the
edges
with
virtually
no
head
in
the
middle
i
was
surprised
by
the
amount
of
carbonation
as
the
quick
dying
head
led
me
to
believe
this
may
be
a
bit
on
the
flat
side
not
the
case
not
sure
how
to
describe
the
taste
here
but
ill
give
it
a
shot
first
off
its
fairly
mild
a
bit
fruity
hint
of
fig
and
very
light
tasting
with
some
fine
carbonation
slightly
hoppy
with
some
grassy
overtones
not
that
i
go
around
eating
grass
but
thats
the
impression
i
got
nonetheless
also
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
really
its
just
kind
of
a
blah
beer
for
me
its
easlily
drinkable
but
just
not
enjoyable
i
was
hoping
to
like
this
one
more
but
so
far
new
belgium
has
failed
to
impress
me
great
gateway
beer
for
getting
people
off
swill
otherwise
dont
bother
nice
kite
on
the
bottle
bright
and
clear
orange
smells
scrumptious
smoky
malt
and
hops
peachy
fruit
and
something
bitter
and
nutty
raisin
all
the
size
of
a
belgian
with
no
muscle
taste
is
very
mild
malty
with
a
fire
roasted
chestnut
note
like
an
amber
ale
in
its
simplicity
very
dainty
hop
addition
lends
a
smooth
crisp
finish
also
notable
in
the
finish
is
a
spritzy
spiciness
unique
extremely
flavorful
for
4
an
interesting
effort
from
nb
a
little
messy
though
in
its
attempt
to
quietly
meld
these
flavors
suffers
a
bit
as
jumbled
i
think
i
actually
prefer
this
from
the
bottle
theres
no
pretense
that
way
something
to
swig
from
while
the
mariners
lose
otherwise
ther
aint
much
point
to
this
this
isnt
horrible
but
it
isnt
worth
shelling
out
craft
beer
money
for
when
you
can
buy
a
perfectly
adequate
macro
that
wont
be
far
below
this
quite
light
with
a
wheat
bite
around
a
dry
saltless
biscuit
around
raw
almonds
a
touch
of
lemon
balm
theres
little
spice
aside
from
some
wheat
husks
this
is
a
pretty
airy
beer
with
nothing
to
scare
the
fat
tire
drinker
pours
a
beautifully
brilliantly
clear
goldencopper
color
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
pale
tan
head
the
aroma
is
bready
and
a
bit
yeast
surprising
considering
there
is
no
residual
yeast
left
in
this
beer
with
notes
of
lime
and
a
hint
of
woodiness
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
and
certainly
spritzy
as
it
first
hits
my
tongue
the
carbonation
adds
quite
a
bit
of
zesty
spritzy
character
to
this
light
brew
there
is
some
nice
herbal
spiciness
here
as
well
as
a
bit
of
dry
lemonlike
acidity
and
zest
especially
in
the
finish
this
is
a
nice
light
refreshing
brew
which
is
good
to
sip
on
a
hot
summer
day
there
is
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
here
that
accentuates
the
kaffir
lime
leaf
and
adds
a
bit
more
to
the
citrusy
zing
though
the
citrus
is
somewhat
subtle
at
least
compared
to
the
stone
04
i
had
recently
i
was
recently
at
a
restaurant
in
cripple
creek
colorado
and
they
had
loft
in
bottles
for
lack
of
anything
better
i
made
the
mistake
of
ordering
one
the
appearance
was
a
light
amber
with
a
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
was
faintly
floral
with
a
portent
of
coming
cloves
malt
was
conspicuous
for
its
absence
and
a
sour
lemony
flavor
dominated
carbonation
was
light
mouthfeel
was
dry
but
lacking
in
yeast
a
disappointing
offering
from
new
belgium
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
and
you
definitely
feel
the
carbonation
in
your
mouth
a
straw
flavor
with
a
light
finish
very
straightforward
and
refreshing
very
unpretentious
and
a
good
summer
beer
of
the
three
lighter
beers
from
new
belgium
this
is
my
favourite
due
to
the
fullness
of
body
nice
finish
candy
sugar
nose
and
plain
old
drinkability
the
belgian
part
is
subdued
with
a
more
conservative
flavour
profile
taking
over
it
almost
tastes
like
okanagan
pale
ale
at
times
i
intend
in
getting
more
of
this
while
it
is
available
as
it
is
a
great
summer
seasonal
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
scent
its
sweet
smelling
with
some
musty
notes
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
refreshes
its
a
bit
grainy
with
a
nice
malty
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
seasonal
brew
and
at
only
115
calories
its
good
for
you
overall
not
recommended
prefer
1554
fat
tire
by
nb
brewing
to
loft
not
worth
the
6
sale
price
i
paid
for
this
six
pack
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
with
its
low
abv
of
4
2
it
could
turn
into
a
100
degree
summer
session
beer
it
is
low
on
calories
too
but
who
cares
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
the
head
is
white
with
a
slight
yellow
tint
to
it
it
looks
fluffy
it
fades
slowly
leaving
thick
laces
it
smells
very
cirtusy
the
aroma
of
hops
is
quite
present
it
smells
just
a
little
like
fat
tire
ever
so
slightly
biscuty
it
tastes
fruity
there
is
a
strong
orange
flavor
present
it
tastes
cirtusy
the
hops
flavor
is
strong
but
not
over
aggressive
can
a
flavor
be
strong
and
mild
and
the
same
time
it
tastes
slightly
spicy
just
a
slight
hint
of
cloves
this
beer
is
carboneted
just
a
little
too
much
i
think
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
taste
just
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
it
is
very
smooth
definately
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
the
flavor
is
a
little
lacking
it
is
still
quite
decent
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
the
mild
taste
is
very
non
aggressive
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
all
summer
long
definately
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
quite
high
even
though
it
seems
a
bit
disappointing
i
will
probably
buy
some
of
this
next
time
im
back
in
omaha
and
looking
for
a
sessionable
brew
but
probably
not
before
ive
tried
some
other
breweries
i
cant
get
here
in
iowa
city
a
real
contender
in
the
champagne
of
beers
category
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
it
doesnt
make
it
bad
it
just
isnt
the
most
flavorful
of
beers
out
there
nice
copper
color
some
malt
aroma
small
phenol
level
present
a
slight
citric
nose
also
present
not
much
fruitiness
to
it
slight
spice
character
hardly
noticeable
maltiness
never
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
it
is
distinguishable
to
the
palate
moderate
body
smooth
medium
carbonation
a
drinkable
beer
for
the
season
some
spice
to
accent
spicy
food
nice
bottle
not
much
flavours
to
speak
of
really
not
hoppy
or
malty
the
flavour
dissapears
really
quickly
i
really
cant
pick
any
flavours
that
stand
out
and
the
palate
is
so
soft
that
its
almost
nonexistent
my
first
in
a
line
of
many
dissapointments
with
this
brewer
bright
and
light
in
the
mouth
steadily
carbonation
this
begs
for
warm
temperatures
and
days
when
beer
can
be
consumed
outside
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
pretty
plain
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
12oz
bottle
mine
poured
a
golden
color
without
too
much
head
to
it
it
was
fairly
clear
the
aroma
is
that
pretty
familiar
commercial
lager
beer
smell
im
kind
of
suprised
since
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
belgian
ale
nothing
else
really
there
except
maybe
a
hint
of
floral
notes
slight
wheat
taste
with
some
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
nothing
bad
about
it
but
nothing
to
make
you
want
to
have
another
either
drinkability
quite
drinkable
especially
with
the
low
abv
the
only
thing
that
would
stop
me
from
drinking
several
would
be
my
desire
to
switch
to
something
a
bit
more
aggressive

look
for
this

next

when
its
released
again
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
as
good
as
it
is
i
like
it
and
could
easily
drink
many
of
these
they
go
down
without
any
problems
an
excellent
summer
brew
notes
this
is
a
strange
brew
too
dry
too
dry
too
dry
i
like
the
brewery
but
this
is
their
worst
beer
out
of
all
of
the
new
belgium
beers
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
though
i
havent
tasted
la
folie
yet
i
also
have
a
lot
of
fondness
for
their
single
not
brewed
this
year
2004
i
have
a
particular
fondness
for
lowgravity
beers
one
can
drink
all
night
long
and
not
feel
the
effects
too
much
and
this
fits
that
bill
well
it
really
fits
the
belgian
model
of
brewing
well
unique
and
interesting
ingredients
brewed
in
a
firmly
traditional
style
innovative
but
innovation
in
pursuit
of
flavor
and
not
for
its
own
sake
edit
im
docking
it
to
3
0
as
it
really
isnt
that
tasty
still
refreshing
but
still
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
too
shabby
for
midoctober
but
it
would
probably
be
better
when
it
isnt
about
45
outside
rotation
retired
the
beers
body
is
also
light
overall
this
is
an
aboveaverage
beer
the
taste
has
only
a
trace
of
that
plastic
i
came
to
loathe
mostly
what
is
here
is
a
perfectly
tender
pale
ale
lots
of
toasty
hop
character
to
go
around
and
insanely
drinkable
i
could
wolf
down
a
pizza
and
sixer
of
this
without
batting
an
eye
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
this
is
an
excellent
summertime
beer
for
quaffing
with
friends
or
while
sitting
out
on
the
back
porch
listening
to
th
baseball
game
on
the
radio
the
light
body
and
texture
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
mexican
beers
that
ive
had
but
without
the
corn
adjunct
sweetness
id
grab
this
one
again
this
is
as
light
as
a
nonlight
beer
can
get
and
yet
i
dont
mind
it
at
all
it
is
a
nice
break
after
a
deluge
of
thick
cloying
stouts
and
porters
the
last
summer
gasp
before
we
settle
into
the
darker
half
of
the
year
not
bad
taste
is
grassy
with
a
dry
hoppiness
lightly
fruity
and
bitter
airy
wheat
malt
and
a
bit
grainy
did
i
mention
dry
well
the
mouth
is
dry
too
and
crisp
lightly
fizzy
on
the
tongue
pretty
good
and
very
drinkable
surprisingly
good
and
straight
forward
overall
impression
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
flavor
just
seems
harsh
and
unpleasant
my
least
enjoyed
new
belgium
so
far
loft
doesnt
quite
take
flight
as
befits
a
beer
with
a
soaring
kite
on
its
label
but
it
has
no
trouble
staying
airborne
and
was
a
welcome
and
uplifting
addition
to
my
day
thanks
to
marc77
for
the
bottle
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
light
tangerine
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
with
some
sweet
fruity
esters
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
not
really
too
strong
of
a
smell
though
the
taste
is
also
very
malty
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
and
a
bready
yeast
character
slightly
spicy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
and
watery
the
drinkability
is
good
though
a
decent
brew
thanks
to
bdiddy
for
the
bottle
dark
yellow
color
moderate
head
sticky
lace
smell
is
light
lemon
and
new
belgiums
trademark
buscuit
maltiness
taste
is
yeasty
malty
and
very
light
and
smooth
excellent
hotday
beer
too
expensive
to
be
considered
lawnmower
beer
however
overall
i
think
this
does
very
well
as
a
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
one
of
the
few
my
girlfriend
actually
likes
would
buy
it
again
if
i
was
ever
out
west
for
awhile
i
should
note
that
when
i
was
tasting
this
beer
we
were
tasting
many
other
beers
before
it
that
were
quite
disappointing
the
lack
of
good
beer
before
this
may
have
set
this
up
to
be
better
than
it
truly
is
the
hops
are
crisp
but
the
taste
of
apples
predominates
the
beer
even
looks
like
apple
juice
its
a
straightfoward
beerunremarkable
but
unobjectionable
as
i
drank
more
the
taste
became
more
and
more
sour
the
fruit
taste
became
more
dominate
as
i
approach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
on
the
last
sip
i
cringed
a
little
at
the
sweetness
loft
pours
a
respectable
dark
golden
orange
color
head
is
moderate
and
leaves
nice
lacing
smell
is
lightly
hoppy
with
some
light
sweetness
sip
starts
with
mild
hoppiness
and
ends
with
a
notable
floral
taste
taste
is
fairly
balanced
but
lacks
any
commanding
flavor
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
complex
beer
not
a
bad
beer
and
easily
drinkable
but
lacks
a
strong
enough
flavor
to
be
really
good
average
across
the
board
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
hints
of
reddish
orange
light
lacing
is
minimal
leaves
light
residue
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
more
grain
earthy
bread
tones
are
also
noted
slight
malt
and
citrus
aroma
but
not
much
the
tase
is
like
a
light
grape
nut
cereal
with
semi
caramel
malts
hints
of
lemon
zest
as
well
light
and
dull
drinkable
if
nothing
else
available
not
a
bad
beer
from
ft
collins
but
not
the
first
id
grab
from
new
belgium
appearance
was
golden
orange
in
color
poured
a
nice
head
that
left
a
sticky
lacing
down
the
side
smell
was
of
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
bread
taste
was
curious
a
bit
fruity
with
a
dry
hopped
finish
mouthfeel

i

than

final
thoughts
it
almost
strikes
me
that
this
beer
probably
was
made
to
be
opened
poured
left
to
settle
down
and
warm
up
substantially
before
drinking
i
agree
many
beers
should
be
warmed
before
serving
but
this
stuff
seems
to
be
looking
for
room
temperature
which
is
a
bit
too
much
in
my
book
its
still
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
wouldnt
rank
this

i

with

flavor
to

the

very

in

along

i
greatly
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
be
looking
for
it
at
my
local
bottle
shop
prost
had
another
and
there
was
no
debris
still
extremely
tasty
did
not
notice

difference

fairly

finish
apple
aroma
flavors
are
very
strong
finishes
with
a
subtle
comfortable
warming
sensation
from
the
7
abv
the
alcohol
lets
you
know
its
there
but
doesnt
negatively
impact
the
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
o
i
found
this
was
spicier
than
most
of
the
belgian
pale
ales
i
have
tasted
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
nice
aroma
and
lots
of
good
flavors
here
this
is
a
really
delicious
beer
my
only
knock
against
it
might
be
the
lack
of
support
for
the
initial
tartness
which
comes
later
towards
the
finish
it
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
great
and
is
pretty
bang
on
in
terms
of
how
to
do
this
style
and
make
it
really
tasty
a
very
clean
beer
with
a
fair
bit
of
yeast
spice
to
it
easy
to
drink
4
o
very
easy
drinking
if
a
bit
boring
hides
the
fairly
high
abv
very
well
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
ok
value
but
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
the
same
price
overall
pretty
good
beer
stays
within
the
wide
range
of
this
style
reminds
me
a
little
of
new
belgium
tripel
but
with
more
spice
and
less
banana
i
would
give
this
a
try
i
could
also
see
myself
buying
this
again
overall
a
good
and
easy
drinking
beer
my
only
quibble
would
be
the
very
high
carbonation
think
champagne
o
in
all
honesty
i
bought
this
beer
to
get
the
glass
i
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
it
but
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
drinkability
of
it
my
belgian
friend
says
this
is
usually
a
sessionpub
beer
there
and
i
am
not
surprised
its
easy
going
and
tasty
rock
solid
and
much
cheaper
than
similar
belgians
ends
up
feeling
pretty
balanced
and
flavorful
with
i
would
say
an
emphasis
on
the
spicy
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
certainly
something
i
would
drink
again
as
it
just
feels
like
a
well
made
brew
when
you
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
sip
nice
complexity
throughout
o
very
good
beertasty
for
sure
d
the
aroma
is
the
star
of
the
show
all
other
components
are
a
notch
or
two
above
average
the
end
result
is
a
solid
but
unremarkable
belgian
pale
ale
spot
on
for
the
style
in
most
expects
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
turn
down
the
opportunity
if
offered
however
im
not
sure
this
is
something
i
would
personally
invest
in
again
in
the
future
o
seems
better
than
the
last
time
i
tried
this
beer
a
very
solid
representative
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
class
and
definitely
a
repeat
purchase
first
few
sips
are
excellent
but
there
is
a
certain
standardness
to
the
beer
that
is
pervasive
the
beer
does
not
stray
far
from
its
roots
and
is
exceptionally
well
crafted
however
i
feel
as
if
i
am
yearning
for
just
a
little
more
o
pretty
good
its
lighter
on
flavor
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
drink
fast
even
so
its
easy
drinking
and
the
spice
citrus
and
malt
are
harmonized
pretty
well

definitely
a

it
comes

i
hate
overly
carbonated
beers
that
keep
you
belching
for
24
hours
straight
husband
and
i
both
had
a
tummy
ache
after
consuming
a
single
bottle
wont
be
trying
this
again
however
loved
the
color
smell
and
after
taste
a
very
pretty
beer
in
terms
of
appearance
overall
a
great
belgian
that
is
very
refreshing
and
light
it
may
not
have
all
the
complexities
of
some
of
the
stronger
belgain
ales
but
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
nonetheless
a
pleasant
example
of
the
style
easy
drinking
and
deceptively
strong
it
is
the
type
of
beer
that
grows
as
you
drink
it
from
an
average
belgian
blond
to
a
pleasant
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
starting
into
the
belgian
world
liked
the
fact
that
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
you
can
still
feel
some
hops
dont
mistake
this
one
per
a
dubbel
tripel
etc
those
are
bolder

rate

o
this
is

bpa
the
affligem
blond
has
the
complexity
you
find
in
the
best
of
belgian
ales
this
is
a
bold
blond
that
has
the
quality
to
fulfill
delicious
and
gorgeous
i
dont
care
who
owns
affligem
abbey
ales
they
are
creating
some
damn
fine
liquids
in
their
brewery
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
its
good
enough
to
have
again
itd
be
a
superb

weather
ale
very
enjoyable
o
affligem
blond
is
a
tasty
and
wellcrafted
representative
of
this
style
nice

definately
would
pick
some

again

will

i
realize
this
is
owned
by
heineken
but
its
still
a
version
of
belgian
pale
ales
as
it
is
full
of
flavor
heartiness
and
enough
thickness
that
it
resembles
the
trappist
beers
that
it
is
attempting
to
emulate
the
success
of
this
beer
owes
to
the
yeast
which
is
both
fruity
and
spicy
here
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
especially
after
a
long
busy
day
also
could
serve
as
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
interested
in
trying
belgian
ales
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
smell
it
didnt
smell
pleasant
like
most
belgians
it
may
have
the
best
mouthfeel
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
drank
though
to
me
it
has
actually
set
the
standard
to
which
all
other
beers
are
compared
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
almost
slippery
for
a
split
second
it
tasted
very
light
like
a
lager
then
you
start
to
taste
the
belgian
origin
with
its
elevated
sharp
alcoholic
bite
and
sweet
citrus
notes
its
a
very
mild
flavor
and
is
gone
quickly
only
to
return
a
few
seconds
later
with
slightly
alcoholic
aftertaste
overall
very
drinkable
for
7
abv
beer
the
taste
is
as
varying
and
rich
as
the
nose
with
initial
honey
and
biscuit
being
parried
by
citrus
noble
hops
and
more
yeast
the
texture
is
delicate
without
being
thin
and
helps
smooth
out
some
of
the
rough
with
all
those
different
flavors
this
isnt
a
style
i
usually
jump
at
but
this
is
a
solidly
crafted
enjoyable
product
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
with
spicy
notes
similar
to
that
of
a
leffe
this
is
a
hearty
drink
and
will
warm
you
up
clocking
in
at
6
7
abv
if
you
like
blonde
belgians
you
will
love
this
beer
always
consistent
always
excellent
post
comment
as
this
beer
warmed
it
had
a
cider
like
quality
with
clear
apple
overtones
and
a
creamier
mouthfeel
it
was
more
enjoyable
this
way
and
i
would
recommend
letting
it
warm
slightly
before
imbibing
overall
an
average
belgian
blond
nothing
that
wows
but
nothing
that
offends
real
easy
going
and
can
be
enjoyed
by
a
wide
variety
of
people
o
this
is
a
complex
brew
that
transitions
into
many
different
flavors
yet
balances
out
very
nicely
a
strong
ale
but
high
drinkability
o
a
solid
belgian
blond
ale
and
rather
affordable
by
that
standard
overall
one
of
the
most
drinakable
strong
blonde
tripels
ive
ever
had
very
balanced
and
refined
im
impressed
pours
murky
golden
in
color
with
palpable
chunks
of
yeast
sediment
meandering
through
the
brew
the
head
is
frothy
and
white
but
not
especially
substantial
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
noticeable
hop
presence
reminiscent
of
saaz
along
with
some
mild
orchard
flavors
and
a
surprising
dose
of
alcohol
for
the
abv
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
spice
to
augment
the
aforementioned
elements
the
carbonation
is
just
about
perfect
and
lends
an
excellent
mouthfeel
despite
that
i
find
the
overall
flavor
to
be
only
decent
hops
and
booze
just
arent
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
ale
though
i
guess
i
cant
exactly
be
surprised
seeing
as
this
is
a
strong
pale
a
little
more
fruit
andor
spice
to
enhance
the
balance
would
be
welcome
to
help
elevate
this
beer
from
solid
to
special
o
a
very
enjoy
belgian
with
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
some
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
o
very
good
belgian
treat
it
usually
costs
less
than
other
options
in
that
style
but
is
just
as
good
ive
had
it
on
tap
in
a
random
marseilles
hotel
but
the
bottle
tasted
better

off

with

that
reduces
to
a

that
lingers
some

spotty
lacing
on

of
carbonation
streaming
up
aromas
of
big

fairly

and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
blonde
ale
very
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
really
enjoyable
stuff
o
good
beer
but
once
again
the
nose
makes
promises
that
arent
delivered
in
the
taste
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangebeige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spice
citrus
and
yeast
taste
is
of
malt
spice
yeast
and
some
banana
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
that
lingers
long
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
better
flavor
than
taste
in
my
opinion
the
brew
has
some
disapointments
but
the
good
qualities
of
it
are
just
too
exceptional
and
easily
make
up
for
it
id
have
this
again
anytime
real
fascinating
brew
m
light
to
medium

from
the

fl

it
pours
a
very
attractive
top
of
the
line
heady
pale
yellow
with
a
slight
fog
floating
around
and
busy
carbonation
on
the
nose
i
get
an
enticing
dose
of
belgian
yeast
soft
delicate
malts
sugar
and
pear
the
body
is
pleasantly
creamy
and
a
bit
better
than
medium
in
texture
the
taste
is
sweet
with
malts
and
yeast
and
a
light
hopped
ending
almost
bitter
ending
this
is
a
marvelous
abbey
blonde
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
on
a
warm
spring
day
doa
i
dont
remember
liking
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
last
night
not
sure
why
pours
a
fairly
clear
golden
blonde
color
with
a
nice
belgian
bubbly
white
head
a
few
yeast
floaters
hangning
around
smells
is
yeast
forward
very
enticing
some
lighter
fruity
notes
as
well
flavor
is
that
classic
belgian
blond
or
golden
ale
its
not
as
good
as
a
duvel
say
but
its
similar
in
flavor
really
nice
with
some
pistachios
and
cashews
and
some
fine
cheese
feel
is
nice
and
bubbly
and
light
very
sessionable
all
up
a
very
worthy
belgian
as
a
reasonable
price
d
this
one
thoroughly
exceeded
all
expectations
a
very
authentic
belgian
ale
with
a
great
flavor
profile
and
really
easy
going
down
as
well
probably
the
fastest
ive
quaffed
down
a
glass
of
beer
in
a
while
but
i
get
the
feeling
ill
be
going
through
many
more
glasses
of
affligem
blond
in
the
notsodistant
future
o
very
nice
looking
forward
to
another
translucent
golden
orange
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
white
head
sheets
of
lace
and
a
bit
of
retention
nose
is
bready
and
crisp
caramel
gentle
hopping
and
fruity
esters
quite
inviting
all
in
all
taste
is
heavily
spiced
and
fruity
notes
similar
to
the
nose
prevail
pale
and
lightly
caramelized
malts
a
tinge
of
metal
and
again
light
noble
hopping
a
bit
of
apple
juice
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
heavily
effervescent
and
spicy
perhaps
on
the
harsher
side
of
things
a
nice
bspa
with
a
few
less
desirable
qualities
that
keep
from
being
on
par
with
some
of
the
better
offerings
in
my
market
wish
they
had
this
on
tap
instead
of
just
in
bottles
because
this
is
one
of
the
best
blonds
on
the
market
d
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
session
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
plenty
of
times
before
and
happy
to
have
gotten
it
after
volunteering
for
the
bbf
back
in
february
very
delicious
and
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
their
beers
o
really
nice
and
drinkable
pretty
rare
here
in
spain
so
i
was
glad
to
pick
it
up
and
try
it
d
the
bitterness
of
this
belgian
strong
pale
ale
is
appealing
and
im
liking
it
if
youre
off
put
by
sugary
belgian
strong
ales
then
id
recommend
giving
this
a
try
o
a
very
drinkable
bspa
id
definitely
drink
another
one
overall
definitely
a
spicy
beer
not
as
bitter
as
youd
expect
for
a
pale
ale
this
for
me
is
a
rare
beer
that
i
could
have
multiple
glasses
in
almost
any
season
im
drinking
it
now
in
cold
wintery
pennsylvania
but
it
would
totally
work
at
the
beer
in
the
summer
too
love
this
beer
overall
happy
to
give
this
one
a
shot
on
tap
it
has
a
nice
well
balanced
taste
and
would
probably
work
well
as
a
gateway
beer
to
get
others
away
from
macros
clear
and
carbonated
with
a
slignt
amber
tone
single
finger
of
clean
white
head
pours
on
top
smells
sweet
with
a
good
helping
of
sour
to
fill
the
nose
very
aromatic
with
little
hop
presence
initially
tastes
bitter
like
a
pilsner
with
more
malt
presence
than
found
in
the
smell
not
much
hop
to
find
in
this
beer
aside
from
a
nice
fading
bitter
aftertaste
very
sweet
fruity
and
sour
with
enough
malt
content
and
body
to
add
a
solid
amount
of
flavor
to
this
beer
while
keeping
it
very
refreshing
well
balanced
with
the
flavors
changing
throghout
the
whole
sip
plenty
of
carbonation
initially
but
dissipates
faster
than
i
would
like
it
to
a
very
nice
beer
yes
i
am
going
to
describe
it
like
that
poured
a
vibrant
clearish
gold
w
twofinger
fizzy
head
that
died
slow
and
left
lace
down
the
glass
somewhat
trypical
belgian
aroma
of
yeast
and
orange
citric
but
im
also
picking
up
light
sweet
notes
as
well
as
some
funky
herbal
hops
a
touch
of
fruit
light
crisp
body
that
passes
easily
and
is
lively
on
the
tongue
thanks
to
good
carbonation
a
touch
of
spiciness
complements
the
beer
but
its
mostly
a
balance
of
light
fruit
like
pearsgrapeapple
w
a
sour
twist
also
some
good
sugary
sweetness
and
breadychewiness
make
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
overall
a
solid
compact
brew
that
is
nice
to
sip
on
oh
yeah
very
nice
lacing
too
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
w
a
huge
three
finger
off
white
head
excellent
lacing
and
carbonation
a
somewhat
hazy
beer
in
appearance
smell
is
really
nice
clove
banana
other
fruit
yeast
malt
other
spices
not
overpowering
just
really
balanced
and
well
done
taste
is
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
w
a
tiny
little
alcohol
burn
on
the
aftertaste
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
still
really
good
feel
is
light
somewhat
syrupy
with
some
hop
feel
balancing
the
malt
smoothness
overall
a
totally
solid
beer
and
one
im
sure
ill
have
again
d
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
hides
its
relatively
high
abv
give
it
a
try
o
solid
blond
ale
taste
sweet
honey
malt
flavours
moderate
bitterness
and
a
dry
lingering
finish
with
a
hint
of
banana
it
seems
cleaner
than
heavier
belgians
the
aftertaste
doesnt
overpower
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
deceivingly
light
d
flavorful
and
fairly
light
nice
malt
and
yeast
characters
oyou
really
could
taste
that
1000
years
old
tradition
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
o
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
d
i
could
happily
have
one
or
two
more
they
are
light
and
refreshing
with
a
touch
of
complexity
just
not
quite
as
much
as
i
wouldve
liked
foodwise
the
best
i
can
think
of
would
be
pears
and
dates
wrapped
in
bacon
with
a
balsamic
vinegar
reduction
but
the
carmelizedsour
tones
of
a
balsamic
reduction
on
meats
would
do
well
also
the
taste
delivers
upon
the
smell
spices
tickled
upon
the
palate
gently
sweet
alcohol
maltiness
that
leaves
a
heavy
residual
mid
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
judged
this
heaviness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
to
take
a
little
away
from
the
crispness
of
the
finish
and
my
liking
for
the
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
greatly
satisfied
with
this
beer
and
it
satisfied
my
desire
for
a
dependable
belgian
id
like
just
a
little
more
spice
and
character
however
nonetheless
it
was
good
o
its
alright
just
kind
shake
that
residual
sweetness
a
little
to
much
for
my
taste
this
is
a
very
nice
blond
beer
and
i
would
gladly
sip
one
of
these
alongside
a
meal
in
the
summertime
im
quite
impressed
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
good
retention
and
good
lace
nose
is
full
of
herbal
hops
honey
sweetness
and
belgian
fruityness
the
taste
is
much
the
same
and
a
touch
of
earth
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
nice
offering
and
new
to
my
area
i
will
recommend
overall
nicely
balanced
and
fresh
blond
beer
pours

d
tasty
and
good
yeasty
sour
flavors
great
recipe
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
rustic
chicken
dishes
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
and
found
it
to
be
a
classic
probably
over
smooth
belg
beer
overall
is
this
is
strong
version
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
imo
doesnt
have
the
juice
or
the
deep
taste
to
qualify
listed
as
affligem
grand
cru
on
the
board
where
i
had
it
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
redorange
with
a
three
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
two
fingers
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
and
banana
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
banana
dark
fruit
and
very
subtle
fruit
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
glad
i
got
an
opportunity
to
try
this
one
on
tap
i
could
imagine
this
one
being
a
little
different
in
the
bottle
but
that
is
pure
speculation
as
i
had
it
long
before
i
was
reviewing
beers
so
it
is
hard
to
say
for
sure
but
this
was
quite
enjoyable
definitely
worth
getting
a
pour
on
tap
if
you
see
it
o
overall
a
very
tasty
belgian
offering
some
great
flavours
and
is
easily
drinkable
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
the
weirdest
beer
ive
ever
hadreviewed
its
so
fun
to
drink
though
i
had
it
in
my
fridge
for
about
a
day
and
half
so
when
i
took
it
out
it
was
ice
cold
and
with
10
minutes
and
it
still
being
nice
and
cool
it
changed
so
much
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
overall
a
pretty
unimpressive
beer
for
me
again
not
sure
if
this
is
a
factor
of
the
age
of
the
beer
or
not
i
have
tried
this
beer
but
only
a
small
amount
on
tap
recently
and
similarly
thought
it
was
rather
unexciting
so
i
have
a
feeling
the
age
is
not
the
whole
reason
oh
well
i
like
the
style
a
lot
but
this
is
not
a
standout
in
my
books
overall
easy
drinker
thats
lighter
tasting
but
still
interesting
pretty
good
stuff
overall
affligem
is
a
refreshing
and
affordable
belgian
ale
but
is
not
an
amazing
beer
it
looks
and
smells
the
part
but
the
bland
pallate
and
harshly
bitter
finish
takes
points
away
i
still
purchase
this
beer
often
and
probably
will
in
the
future
it
is
after
all
the
cheapest
belgian
in
my
local
area
at
12
dollars
a
six
pack
notes
classic
funk
classic
malt
classic
belgian
well
made
ale
d
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
ale
affligem
makes
some
very
nice
beers
dr
hides
its
abv
well
but
sure
it
costs
enough
id
have
it
again
if
the
price
were
bob
barker
but
here
in
ireland
itll
take
more
than
a
pretty
euro
cent
to
bag
this
baby
drinkability
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
beer
memorable
it
slightly
misses
the
mark
for
that
but
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
good
value
that
can
be
appropriate
for
many
social
situations
from
watching
a
super
bowl
game
to
sitting
around
with
friends
with
good
conversation
being
had
in
the
right
circumstances
ill
buy
it
again
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
the
flavors
were
perfect
and
made
for
a
relaxing
sipping
beer
delicious
and
enjoyable
not
too
potent
would
have
again
d
good
very
drinkable
stuff
but
not
a
great
beer
i
would
seek
out
worthwhile
though
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
fine
brew
it
is
a
classic
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
has
character
and
altough
it
has
nothing
that
makes
it
feel
great
it
also
seems
to
have
no
flows
note
labeled
as
6
8
i
picked
this
one
up
because
i
figured
if
theyve
been
making
beer
since
1074
they
must
be
doing
something
right
its
a
very
good
belgian
ale
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
nothing
about
it
jumps
out
as
being
extra
special
but
its
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
definitely
worth
a
try
i
buy
it
again
and
again
and
again
bottle
purchased
from
the
liquor
control
board
in
ontario
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
huge
white
head
the
head
doesnt
dissipate
an
inch
until
i
started
drinking
some
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
candied
fruity
malt
with
some
belgian
yeast
and
pepper
some
bitterness
in
the
flavour
with
some
mild
sweetness
really
big
carbonation
which
seems
to
work
for
this
beer
quite
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
ive
enjoyed
all
of
the
affligem
beers
ive
had
but
this
is
the
first
that
ive
reviewed
wow
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
the
taste
is
powerful
but
overwhelmingly
good
if
you
can
find
this
gem
dont
pass
the
opportunity
to
drink
it
tastedrinkability
this
is
one
of
the
most
perfectly
flavored
and
balanced
midrange
apv
belgian
blonde
ales
ive
had
very
comparable
in
taste
and
drinkability
to
the
leffe
i
had
a
few
weeks
earlier
i
think
i
found
my
new
favourite
style
of
beer
perhaps
belgian
blonde
ales
rock
d
anyway
a
good
bear
to
drink
in
large
amounts
with
happiness
d
definitely
a
good
example
for
this
style
of
beer
not
overly
complex
but
enough
to
serve
as
an
introduction
quite
enjoyable
overall
id
pick
this
one
up
again
if
i
had
the
opportunity
this
is
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
to
it
with
a
bunch
of
lacing
this
isnt
the
best
of
this
style
in
my
opinion
there
are
several
out
there
that
are
acceptable
that
said
this
isnt
bad
just
not
the
best
the
carbonation
was
good
and
allowed
you
to
enjoy
the
light
fruity
flavor
the
alcohol
flavor
wasnt
too
strong
either
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
this
beer
quite
drinkable
although
it
is
better
when
sipped
easy
blonde
but
with
personality
too
drinkablity
light
weight
d
its
a
good
beer
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
compared
to
some
of
its
counterparts
however
this
lends
itself
as
a
good
nightcapper
its
significantly
cheaper
than
some
of
the
other
belgians
in
the
cooler
id
buy
it
again
d
the
flavour
is
full
intense
and
befitting
the
style
the
alcohol
kick
works
well
but
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
a
couple
per
sitting
d
a
model
of
its
style
affligem
blonde
is
sophisticated
complex
and
coarse
all
at
the
same
time
worth
a
try
if
youre
just
looking
for
a
refreshing
complex
brew
d
decent
example
of
the
style
without
being
mindblowing
drinkable
without
too
much
trouble
affligem
blond
pours
not
quite
crystal
clear
but
is
a
radiant
lemon
yellow
three
and
a
half
fingers
of
head
rise
about
as
high
as
they
could
have
in
the
glass
without
cascading
out
and
down
the
sides
of
it
lacing
is
almost
entirely
nonexistent
but
that
may
in
part
have
been
due
to
my
glass
so
i
cant
dock
it
fully
although
no
remains
were
left
the
creamy
white
cap
did
stick
around
for
an
impressive
amount
of
time
the
nose
is
decent
but
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
powerful
pale
sweet
malts
dominate
theres
just
a
faint
hint
of
clovepeppery
phenols
which
for
my
money
isnt
enough
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
smaller
version
of
duvel
apples
and
pears
come
through
first
with
just
a
touch
of
bready
flavors
present
as
well
the
hop
bitterness
while
not
high
is
very
noticeable
thanks
to
its
whipcrack
brief
nature
clove
comes
in
for
the
close
along
with
a
slight
herbal
hop
flourish
its
not
bad
but
id
like
a
fair
bit
more
of
a
contribution
from
the
yeast
if
im
drinking
a
bspa
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
the
brewer
nailed
the
balance
between
being
lightnimble
and
having
some
presence
to
it
carbonation
is
nice
and
expressive
but
could
stand
to
be
ratcheted
up
even
a
little
more
affligem
blond
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
couldnt
ever
see
myself
buying
it
over
duvel
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
this
style
beer
its
similar
enough
without
being
quite
as
good
however
i
could
very
well
see
myself
giving
some
to
someone
who
was
just
starting
out
exploring
belgian
style
brews
not
sure
if
i
will
drink
too
many
of
these
alcohol
is
a
tad
pronounced
almost
unhealthy
very
carbonated
d
suitably
inoffensive
likely
catered
to
the
broadest
conceivable
consumer
base
d
decent
tasting
beer
but
drinks
beyond
its
alcohol
percentage
not
as
aggressive
as
duvel
it
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
grilled
spiced
seafood
although
i
found
it
to
give
cheeses
a
slightly
funky
aftertaste
so
id
prefer
to
stay
away
from
dairy
products
when
drinking
this
beer
and
focus
on
shellfish
and
such
poured
from
a
33
cl
bottle
that
i
picked
up
in
a
promotional
four
pack
with
chalice
into
my
brand
new
affligem
chalice
it
gave
me
about
2
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
that
went
down
with
lacing
to
about
12
inch
in
less
than
a
minute
swirled
the
bottle
to
get
that
cloudy
bottom
stuff
into
the
mix
it
has
a
rich
golden
colour
and
a
touch
of
cloudiness
from
bottle
conditioning
i
suspect
smell
is
pleasant
yeasty
and
slightly
fruity
maybe
pears
and
apples
i
like
the
taste
the
alcohol
shines
through
the
flavours
or
pearsapples
and
some
honey
and
overtakes
the
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
warming
and
effervescent
drinkability
is
fine
and
despite
the
nearly
7
abv
i
think
i
could
have
another
too
bad
there
are
only
two
of
these
in
the
four
pack
but
i
did
get
a
nice
chalice
jd
d
this
one
is
a
keeper
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
with
relative
ease
for
an
8
99
six
pack
this
is
a
really
good
value
definitely
worth
revisiting
has
golden
colourslightly
cloudy
smells
of
slightly
sour
fruits
the
bitterish
aftertaste
reminds
of
english
bitters
particulary
harveys
best
the
6
7
abv
is
well
hidden
this
is
a
step
up
from
leffes
blonde
moderate
carbonation
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
would
recomend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
lightly
favored
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
complex
set
of
flavors
it
goes
down
too
easily
and
so
even
at
7
abv
could
lead
one
into
consuming
too
much
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
happy
to
seek
it
out
and
enjoy
it
again
in
the
future
the
lable
on
this
bottle
says
6
8
abv
a
little
less
than
the
7
shown
on
the
ba
listing
not
that
it
matters
much
the
produced
on
code
could
be
a
little
more
user
friendly

poured
into
a
dt
snifter
this
beer
held
up
well
with
12
inch
head
all
the
way
down
wdecent
lacing
aroma
is
not
great
but
the
banana
and
clove
tastes
permeate
throughout
i
like
this
beer
as
the
flavor
is
distinctly
belgium
without
going
overboard
on
price
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
as
it
represents
great
value
notes
really
glad
that
i
kept
this
bottle
and
that
it
survived
the
trip
so
that
i
could
enjoy
it
this
evening
tried
this
from
tap
at
mort
subite
in
brussels
served
in
a
chalice

gold

light
banana
cream

more
pronounced
banana
citrusy
alcohol
taste
leaves
a
light
buttery
cream
coasting
in
your
mouth
delicious
companion
to
my
omlette
mixte
snack
i
think
mort
subite
makes
the
best
omlettes
in
brussels
taste
a
pretty
clean
beer
with
hints
of
alcohol
more
than
expected
for
a
6
5abv
beer
also
some
fruitiness
as
expected
but
the
overall
impression
is
one
of
a
very
pleasantly
yeasty
taste
i
did
pour
the
entire
bottle
into
the
glass
rather
than
electing
to
leave
some
of
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
with
less
of
the
yeast
poured
in
the
beer
would
have
and
even
more
refreshing
taste
this
one
ranks
highly
on
the
list
of
blonds
ive
tried
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
beverage
that
goes
down
rather
easily
good
example
of
the
style
beautifully
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
could
easily
become
my
new
default
beer
drinkability
flavorful
but
fatigues
the
palate
a
bit
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
faint
lemon
and
flowery
in
the
taste
flowery
spicy
and
a
nice
small
citrus
under
all
of
that
a
smooth
a
nd
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
lemon
like
aftertaste
nice
dry
spices
and
dryer
than
a
standard
blond
d
high
drinkability
this
has
become
my
goto
beer
and
i
have
started
buying
this
stuff
by
the
case
it
is
almost
too
easy
to
put
down
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
night
truly
an
excellent
belgian
blond
now
that
is
a
deep
dark
yellow
beer
i
would
say
it
is
as
dark
and
as
clear
as
apple
juice
the
two
finger
white
head
immediately
laces
the
glass
a
rich
yeast
aroma
rises
out
of
the
glass
screaming
belgian
that
bready
and
sweet
flowery
aroma
is
a
good
clue
to
the
high
quality
of
this
blonde
a
lot
more
complex
on
the
palate
with
all
the
different
spices
there
are
more
than
my
simple
palate
can
pick
out
its
like
biting
into
a
fresh
piece
of
bread
with
peppercorns
plus
some
other
spices
there
is
just
a
little
too
much
bitterness
for
me
but
it
does
balance
out
the
beer
well
the
heat
form
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
this
is
a
great
beer
very
complex
flavour
and
a
great
beer
for
once
in
a
while
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
one
after
another
deep
yellow
with
a
light
haze
and
lot
of
floaties
big
fluffy
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
few
sticky
lacings
sweet
malty
smell
with
hints
of
spice
and
banana
big
malty
body
that
is
magnified
with
lively
rollling
carbonation
sweet
malty
taste
with
light
spice
and
banana
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
even
though
the
higher
abv
tends
to
sneak
through
the
flavor
profile
the
sweetness
helps
take
the
edge
off
good
stuff
medium
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
from
a
brew
with
no
major
flaws
d
definitely
a
great
bspa
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
light
enough
and
definitely
tasty
enough
that
having
a
second
isnt
unreasonable
all
in
all
just
a
well
done
beer
with
few
flaws
i
would
definitly
go
for
the
achel
blond
golden
wheat
color
in
the
glass
with
a
rollicking
feathery
head
the
smell
is
a
sugary
sweet
fruitiness
that
struck
me
mildly
like
a
candied
apple
the
body
was
medium
and
provided
quite
a
bit
of
mouth
coating
its
carbonation
was
lively
but
not
as
agressive
as
in
a
duvel
aggligems
flavor
has
a
slightly
spicy
character
i
almost
wanted
to
say
caraway
or
cumin
that
quickly
dissolves
to
a
sugary
sweet
citrus
end
that
finishes
dry
i
drank
this
from
my
duvel
glass
and
that
tells
the
story
its
a
passable
belgian
strong
pale
ale
by
why
wouldnt
you
just
reach
for
a
duvel
instead
cheers
d
this
is
a
powerful
yet
soft
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
i
recommend
this
beer
and
think
it
would
be
great
with
white
meat
or
perhaps
with
a
creamy
pasta
dish
as
the
biscuit
qualities
of
the
beer
would
blend
well
the
beer
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
and
is
a
great
relaxation
brew
for
the
evening
served
at
refrigerator
temperature
from
small
bottle
into
goblet
pours
with
2finger
very
thick
head
initial
aroma
is
of
subtle
fruit
apricot
and
malt
appropriately
strong
carbonation
level
flavor
is
slightly
fruity
and
very
reminiscent
of
duvel
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
which
finds
a
frequent
home
in
my
cabinet
drinkability
i
could
seriously
drink
this
beer
all
day
the
body
isnt
very
heavy
at
all
and
the
flavors
are
robust
and
refreshing
all
at
teh
same
time
the
abv
is
fairly
moderate
as
well
7
and
would
allow
me
to
work
my
way
through
a
couple
could
seriously
be
a
yearround
beer
overall
this
is
a
beer
thats
just
above
middleoftheroad
for
the
style
not
worth
seeking
out
but
certainly
not
worth
avoiding
d
very
drinkable
nice
light
refreshing
great
smell
permeates
through
the
pleasant
spiciness
will
bring
me
back
to
try
again
its
quite
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
worth
a
try
for
sure
id
drink
it
any
day
of
the
week
happily
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
good
carbonation
to
it
and
very
drinkable
maybe
to
easy
given
the
abv
overall
a
decent
ale
nothing
too
exciting
however
an
excellent
belgian
blonde
soft
clean
refreshing
and
complex
d
drinks
very
easily
perhaps
too
much
so
given
its
abv
many
years
ago
the
affligem
beers
were
my
favs
i
recall
when
the
blonde
was
the
shit
i
had
this
one
at
the
austerlitz
train
station
in
paris
and
it
wasnt
quite
like
it
was
poured
with
a
small
fine
off
white
head
and
a
little
lace
color
was
a
clear
amber
aroma
was
malty
yeasty
with
a
little
phenol
flavor
was
the
same
body
was
on
the
thin
side
with
good
carbonation
slightly
sweet
phenol
fiish
with
a
medium
long
fizzy
tang
not
bad
not
great
could
be
a
session
strong
tight
carbonation
d
strong
enough
to
sip
slowly
but
dont
be
afraid
to
take
and
swish
around
a
nice
swig
once
in
awhile
to
experience
a
really
novel
sensation
its
a
good
beer
but
i
prefered
the
dubbel
alot
more
the
nose
is
spicy
with
white
pepper
and
a
light
clove
character
fruity
with
a
blend
of
bananalike
esters
a
honeylike
nose
a
dry
crackerlike
malt
character
a
touch
of
grass
hay
and
potpourri
are
apparent
as
well
this
is
very
well
constructed
the
palate
opens
dry
and
spicy
with
a
delicate
pepper
and
clove
character
along
with
the
classic
bspa
zing
a
touch
of
sugarlike
sweetness
is
perceived
definitely
floral
with
a
touch
of
fruit
this
is
good
stuff
drying
and
crackerlike
on
the
finish
with
flavors
of
grain
and
yeast
present
this
tastes
great
light
in
body
i
find
the
carbonation
a
touch
high
for
my
tastes
this
tends
to
foam
in
my
mouth
a
little
more
than
i
care
for
nonetheless
an
excellent
beer
that
i
will
revisit
without
doubt
overall
a
real
winner
and
drinker
feels
and
tastes
stronger
than
it
is
alcoholwise
the
pint
went
quick
enjoy
overall
an
ale
that
thoroughly
pleases
me
not
at
all
over
the
top
but
still
is
belgian
strength
that
you
shouldnt
mess
around
with
i
on
the
other
hand
wouldnt
mind
getting
into
a
few
more
of
these
splendid
and
simply
beautiful
the
overall
experience
of
drinking
this
beer
is
great
and
this
beer
seems
to
have
it
all
complex
and
tasty
flavor
great
presentation
smooth
mouth
feel
good
abv
and
easy
drinking
another
winner
from
belgium
however
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
2
in
any
one
sitting
as
this
is
just
not
that
kind
of
beer
its
one
to
sip
and
savor
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
with
a
ridiculous
amount
of
particulates
floating
about
in
the
hay
the
head
is
strong
and
thick
taking
its
time
in
dissipating
the
smell
is
somewhat
bland
with
only
traces
of
minor
hops
and
light
grains
filling
the
nostrils
the
taste
is
decidedly
better
with
a
grainy
sweetness
pervading
each
sip
unfortunately
the
floating
yeast
flakes
lend
a
rather
dusty
feel
and
flavor
to
the
proceedings
though
the
moderate
body
and
effervescence
keep
this
from
completely
sabotaging
the
drinkability
a
nicely
balanced
approachable
abbey
ale
the
kind
where
you
can
pick
out
the
individual
esters
sure
but
after
a
while
you
just
wanna
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
integrated
complexities
of
a
fine
belgian
blonde
ale
cheers
d
very
refreshing
beer
with
great
taste
and
flavor
would
definitely
like
to
have
it
again
my
growing
liking
for
belgians
has
been
further
fueled
by
this
bad
boy
they
really
know
how
to
make
their
high
abvs
disappear
this
one
isnt
the
most
flavourful
of
the
style
but
still
one
i
wouldnt
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
drink
again
d
soooo
drinkable
almost
thirstquenching
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
but
dominated
by
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
average
poured
into
a
snifter
very
carbonated
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
good
lace
smelled
of
bitter
noble
hops
with
no
fruitiness
the
taste
did
yield
more
spice
mostly
clove
as
well
as
candi
sugar
and
some
plum
very
thinbodied
and
very
carbonated
when
combined
with
the
thin
flavor
it
almost
seemed
like
they
were
gunning
for
the
belgian
equivalent
of
a
bland
mass
market
american
lager
certainly
light
enough
to
session
in
spite
of
the
alcohol
content
but
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
flavor
and
body
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
yeast
and
citrus
some
spice
taste
is
good
some
citrus
spices
malts
slightly
sweet
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
with
ease
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
high
quality
beer
d
a
very
good
belgian
strong
pale
although
my
drinkability
would
likely
be
affected
slightly
by
the
spices
in
the
beer
simply
a
fantastic
beer
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
and
the
glass
looks
terrific
as
well
t
it
has
a
good
crisp
almost
pilsnery
taste
to
it
has
a
slight
sourish
undertone
with
some
bit
of
cucumber
or
vegetable
of
some
sort
interesting
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
it
has
a
nice
crisp
feel
and
is
really
refreshing
this
is
one
my
dad
had
when
he
visited
france
and
it
came
highly
recommended
it
definitely
looks
like
a
blonde
poured
into
my
westmalle
goblet
it
produces
a
big
frothy
head
that
leaves
behind
considerable
lace
theres
a
lot
of
sediment
but
ive
never
minded
that
the
smell
is
pretty
faint
but
whats
there
offers
a
hint
of
hefelike
fruit
along
with
the
typical
spiciness
i
expect
from
the
style
taste
is
much
bigger
with
clove
and
citrus
followed
by
a
sharp
spiciness
this
really
tastes
more
like
a
hefeblonde
hybrid
to
me
allinall
not
too
bad
at
all
for
something
an
american
micro
might
experiment
with
but
the
problem
is
that
affligem
boasts
itself
as
being
one
of
belgiums
oldest
abbeybreweries
and
this
blonde
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
other
beers
from
the
region
not
exceptional
but
pretty
damn
good
worth
a
try
and
very
enjoyable
it
hits
the
spot
there
really
isnt
much
else
i
can
say
about
it
except
to
try
it
medium
bodied
and
is
rather
smooth
not
too
filling
and
definitely
worth
having
more
a
good
exapmle
of
a
belgian
blonde
warming
has
depth
and
a
body
which
should
be
sipped
not
gulped
down
the
alcohol
sits
well
and
the
beer
is
balanced
nicely
an
enjoyable
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
on
tap
certainly
worthy
of
some
praise
solid
foamy
head
of
close
to
three
fingers
very
active
bone
white
starts
to
dimple
as
it
slowly
recedes
strong
streaks
of
lacing
left
behind
the
orange
coloration
almost
has
a
metallic
glow
to
it
hazy
with
little
hue
loss
at
the
rims
theres
a
brisk
and
clean
quality
to
the
nose
sharper
overall
than
expected
peppery
with
only
a
pinch
of
sweet
baking
spices
herbaceous
and
grassy
as
well
dry
and
hightoned
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
the
yeastiness
too
appears
dry
and
the
banana
peach
apple
fruit
speaks
in
hushed
tones
negligible
softening
at
warmer
temps
mediumbodied
likewise
firm
unto
stern
and
compact
in
the
mouth
additional
clove
cardamom
and
nutmeg
along
with
the
peppery
foundation
the
carbonation
has
a
tight
weave
and
does
not
do
much
to
spread
the
flavors
broadly
the
grassiness
persists
accompanied
by
unprocessed
grains
little
yeastiness
nor
bready
qualities
the
orange
citrus
diminished
as
well
meager
apricot
peach
cherry
fruit
with
a
hint
of
banana
distributor
sample
bottle
so
one
assumes
it
is
in
good
shape
and
representative
d
the
issue
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
it
does
not
stand
out
it
is
to
style
almost
to
a
fault
it
drinks
like
a
session
beer
but
the
abv
is
too
high
by
a
bit
belgian
light
beer
very
drinkable
just
nothing
sticks
out
to
make
it
memorable
d
very
good
drink
with
balanced
complexities
i
have
have
to
try
it
again
in
a
correct
glass
its
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
d
great
blond
with
nice
overtones
of
apricots
and
citrus
fruits
in
addition
to
the
typical
banana
coriander
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
of
runofthemill
blonds
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
d
a
little
better
than
average
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
good
balance
going
on
here
fruity
upfront
spicy
in
the
finish
alcohol
not
noticeable
at
all
very
refreshing
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
but
not
too
far
off
either
really
nothing
bad
i
can
say
about
this
one
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
if
a
bit
mellow
the
alcohol
content
isnt
bad
so
theres
very
little
bite
to
this
concoction
also
the
hop
character
is
understated
so
theres
no
bite
in
that
domain
either
however
it
is
smooth
and
has
a
nice
refreshing
taste
to
it
as
such
i
would
say
it
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
very
light
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
no
carbonation
bite
solid
drinkability
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
pale
belgian
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
ones
within
the
style
overall
a
nice
beer
even
if
a
bit
mass
produced
much
preferred
over
leffe
as
another
example
definitely
drinkable
but
i
feel
like
id
be
wasting
a
good
beer
by
having
more
than
one
or
two
a
night
a
good
beer
for
a
special
occasion
blondes
arent
really
my
type
but
i
wouldnt
disagree
that
they
can
sometimes
be
more
fun
i
could
easily
spend
a
sunny
afternoon
with
affligem
blonde
and
actually
have
fond
memories
of
doing
so
once
plain
and
simple
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
and
immensely
agreeable
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
character
to
warrant
repeated
purchases
ive
had
this
one
on
tap
in
europe
and
then
bought
bottles
when
i
was
back
in
the
states
at
first
the
bottles
were
no
where
near
as
good
but
the
few
that
sat
in
the
fridge
for
a
few
weeks
were
comparable
i
guess
they
had
bottle
shock
can
beers
get
that
like
wines
anyways
this
is
a
textbook
belgian
blond
ale
period
pours
a
light
gold
in
color
with
a
bit
over
a
finger
and
a
half
of
dense
creamy
white
head
with
good
retention
good
aroma
with
a
nice
slightly
sweet
pils
malt
character
and
lots
of
depth
there
is
a
slight
noble
hop
aroma
that
is
herbal
earthy
and
spicy
there
are
also
some
light
fruity
esters
dancing
in
the
background
some
citrus
a
bit
of
sour
apple
and
some
pear
taste
is
pretty
good
pils
malt
upfront
pears
and
some
tart
apple
in
the
middle
and
some
herbal
hops
and
a
bit
of
perfumelike
alcohol
into
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
mediumish
body
that
give
this
brew
a
slightly
creamy
feel
to
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable
ill
be
sure
to
have
this
again
its
a
good
enough
beer
but
the
graininess
isnt
really
working
for
me
drinkability
i
usually
dont
think
of
belgians
as
summer
beers
but
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
that
concept
danielharperaug

and
the
fact
that
its
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
alcohol
scale
makes
me
more
likely
to
drink
it
than

this

still
rather

this

its

and
i
have
to
say
that
i
preferred
the
grimbergen
better
although
i
do
have
to
add
that
i
did
mix
the
bottomdwelling
yeast
into
the
pour
this
undoubtedly
added
to
the
increased
distinctiveness
of
this
beer
i
will
add
that
as
i
continue
to

this

it
is
growing

is
an
interesting
brew
id
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
3070
mix
of
grimbergen
blonde
and
anchor
steam
its
flavorful
but
not
complex
with
orange
and
banana
leading

way
coriander
the
lacing
coats
the
sides
of

with
very
large

aroma
a
bit
one
dimensional
to
me
with
strong
pale
malts
and
mild
hop
finish
and
alcohol
not
too
impressed
some
spicing
going
on
but
very
minimal
taste
not
overly
sweet
crisp
golden
strong
ale
is
the
best
way
to
put
it
an
herbal
hop
flavor
with
pale
malts
dominating
overall
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
lacking
much
texture
besides
the
overcarbonation
drinkability
not
a
classic
belgian
ale
mediocre

coriander
slightly
hazy
gold
it
pours
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
stays
solid
to
the
end
the
smell
is
a
bit
spicy
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
the
funky
smell
expected
with
a
belgian
yeast
a
nice
honeylike
sweetness
is
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
especially
after
it
has
warmed
a
bit
it
goes
down
like
a
session
beer
despite
the
7
abv
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
world
of
beglian
beers
i
sampled
this
beer
a
bit
cold
from
the
fridge
and
the
alcohol
flavor
was
quite
prominent
with
some
yeasty
fruity
flavors
milling
about
to
my
surprise
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
flavors
actually
receded
yet
the
overall
flavor
profile
muted
as
well
a
good
belgian
blonde
i
actually
liked
this
beer
better
when
it
was
cold
while
the
alcohol
flavor
was
a
bit
strong
the
beer
overall
had
more
character
delightful
beer
no
excesses
make
it
highly
drinkable
overall
impression
a
really
pleasant
beer
quaffable
even
i
really
needed
this
after
asking
for
a
job
at
the
brewery
around
the
corner
nerveracking
to
ask
for
a
job
in
a
language
you
only
have
a
faint
grasp
of
needless
to
say
i
put
this
beer
away
quickly
a
delicious
ale
with
a
golden
color
that
has
a
nice
alcoholic
punch
to
it
belgian
lace
throughout
the
glass
and
a
perfect
blend
of
spices
and
fruitiness
make
this
one
of
the
best
blonde
belgians
in
the
world
a
treat
to
enjoy
and
very
drinkable
but
beware
of
the
alcohol
it
does
creep
up
on
you
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
some
orange
hues
it
has
a
large
full
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
strong
of
citrus
and
has
some
hints
of
honey
and
malts
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
weiss
wheat
beer
some
spices
and
a
trace
of
honey
is
present
in
the
taste
as
well
but
the
wheaty
taste
overtakes
the
others
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
too
extremely
smooth
it
leaves
a
slightly
sour
taste
on
the
palate
dont
see
myself
drinking
many
of
these
in
the
future
this
brew
poured
a
large
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
that
leaves
agood
lacing
it
has
a
cloudy
yeasty
light
orange
brown
body
with
a
mild
banana
malt
aroma
it
has
a
tingly
mouthfeel
with
complex
flavors
of
malt
floral
notes
yeast
and
a
touch
of
honey
for
sweetness
its
alcohol
content
ia
again
very
well
hidden
i
rather
liked
this
brew
as
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
nice
overall
quality
to
it
this
brew
poured
a
large
white
invigorating
foamy
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
cloudy
and
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
there
was
carbonation
and
yeast
observed
in
my
glass
the
aroma
was
fruity
sweet
and
citrusy
there
was
a
slight
bitterness
observed
but
overall
a
decent
belgian
ale
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
from
the
folks
at
affligem
it
pours
a
slightly
orangecopper
in
color
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
persistent
head
after
the
froth
dies
down
a
sticky
weblike
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
aromas
are
moderately
spicy
and
sweet
with
slightly
fruity
undertones
initial
taste
is
somewhat
malty
mixed
with
yeast
honey
and
citrus
fruit
a
nice
crisp
zing
of
spiciness
possibly
coriander
is
left
on
the
tongue
this
is
one
exceptionally
complex
yet
balanced
brew
another
great
belgian
beer
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
blondies
drinkability
a
truly
excellent
beer
although
at
7
0
abv
it
is
quite
potent
not
to
be
missed
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
tall
pillowy
white
head
that
dissipates
in
chucks
leaving
a
thick
and
rocky
lace
that
loves
to
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
yeast
honey
and
spice
medium
in
body
and
quite
smooth
taste
is
sweet
honey
malts
and
candied
fruit
followed
by
some
nutty
yeasts
and
some
peppery
notes
some
bitter
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
are
present
in
the
finish
an
incredible
brew
and
one
of
the
best
blonde
ales
on
the
market
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
belgian
anyway
this
pours
more
of
an
amber
than
a
blonde
the
head
is
thick
and
long
lasting
and
creamier
than
shaving
cream
there
is
a
yeastynutty
nose
in
this
one
with
barely
detectable
hops
the
taste
is
very
complex
with
sweet
and
bitter
and
spice
all
mingled
around
the
palate
the
hops
are
more
potent
in
the
beginning
and
the
sweet
malt
comes
last
this
is
excellent
pours
golden
with
a
good
lace
smells
of
honey
some
grain
slightly
herbal
as
well
this
is
extremely
smooth
tasting
fairly
sweet
with
obvious
honey
but
gets
a
little
spicey
as
well
ends
slightly
herbal
fairly
warming
due
to
the
higher
abv
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
kept
me
warm
through
a
fairly
cold
night
could
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
however
pours
cloudy
yellow
orange
color
huge
frothy
off
white
lasting
head
leaves
nice
clingy
sheets
of
lace
down
my
glass
sweet
and
malty
spicy
yeasty
aroma
sweet
sugary
flavors
of
malt
and
spicy
cloves
light
body
and
very
carbonated
finishes
light
and
crisp
on
the
pour
a
glamorous
golden
yellow
to
amber
color
with
the
head
modest
in
size
and
the
lace
a
fine
sheet
to
cling
to
the
glass
both
are
an
off
white
color
nose
is
malt
a
little
yeast
also
noticed
citrus
like
crispness
fresh
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
the
front
is
sweet
the
top
reedy
with
the
finish
pleasantly
acidic
and
delicately
hopped
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
a
nice
drinking
beer
that
is
worth
the
effort
to
find
a
rich
golden
color
with
heavy
tight
creamy
looking
foam
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
complex
in
flavor
with
a
beautiful
balance
of
malts
and
hops
to
bring
out
the
great
flavor
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
it
was
creamy
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
wow
what
a
beer
this
beer
was
pricy
but
worth
it
probably
the
least
interesting
of
the
affligem
brews
but
still
very
nice
floral
aroma
and
nice
soft
palate
finishing
with
a
bitter
bite
very
nice
dangerously
drinkable
notes
just
strong
enough
to
cut
the
chill
out
of
a
damp
fall
day
yet
deceivingly
light
where
i
could
drink
more
than
one
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
the
closest
comparison
i
can
think
of
is
probably
leffe
blond
i
think
this
one
is
better
though
fuller
bodied
and
flavored
nice
crispness
with
alternating
hints
of
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
prickly
carbonation
a
welcome
spiciness
is
ever
present
an
excellent
brew
thats
effortless
to
drink
i
have
to
agree
this
beer
formed
a
phenom
of
a
head
i
thought
i
had
an
ice
cream
float
for
a
few
seconds
it
left
some
nice
lace
after
it
subsided
it
had
the
heavy
carbonation
aspect
common
to
the
belgians
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
and
alcohol
taste
was
of
some
hops
and
citrus
nice
finish
to
it
i
just
cant
shake
the
feeling
that
i
have
had
better
of
this
style
even
ohio
law
limits
my
selection
worth
checking
out
though
aroma
right
off
is
alcoholic
and
gives
a
warning
what
youre
in
for
taste
is
less
strong
than
the
aroma
suggests
smooth
and
refreshing
by
the
time
youre
at
the
bottom
you
feel
the
alcohol
my
favorite
blonde
what
a
beer
pours
with
a
thick
head
almost
like
whipped
cream
nice
subdued
flowery
nose
goes
down
too
easy
very
deceptive
when
you
consider
the
alcoholic
strength
about
7
i
think
another
fine
addition
to
my
beer
aging
cellar
spot
on
perfect
i
want
to
move
to
belgium
053012
at
first
blush
a
pleasant
tartness
that
was
reminiscent
of
cherries
but
not
at
all
sweet
blind
tasted
i
would
never
check
off
the
belgium
box
but
would
the
ill
have
another
box
had
on
tap
while
in
antwerp
pours
amber
colored
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
light
bready
malts
faint
yeast
and
a
bit
of
grass
flavor
follows
with
bready
malt
and
crisp
grassy
finish
bit
of
caramel
with
very
little
of
that
belgian
yeast
flare
and
extremely
low
on
the
sweetness
light
plus
body
with
medium
plus
carbonation
seems
like
quality
of
a
sam
adams
for
belgium
not
bad
but
not
sure
why
one
would
choose
this
when
there
are
so
many
other
options
amber
twist
to
a
belgian
pale
follows
the
nose
with
apple
and
pear
but
picks
up
some
drier
bitterness
and
herbaceous
hops
toward
the
finish
tasty
and
simple
mouthfeel
is
carblight
but
still
good
great
swish
drinkable
as
hell
this
tap
has
been
here
too
long
without
me
partaking
of
its
contents
time
to
rectify
that
it
pours
a
hazy
rusted
tawny
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
faded
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
light
ruby
red
grapefruit
zest
belgian
yeast
a
hint
of
clove
and
a
few
drops
of
maple
syrup
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
mild
grass
and
flowers
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
little
bpa
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
if
youre
here
and
need
a
bit
of
belgianness
its
here
for
you
o
very
mild
but
has
some
really
nice
characteristics
ordered
on
tap
at
a
calgary
ale
house
1600
and
arrived
in
a
genuine
de
koninck
tulip
glass
this
iconic
belgian
pale
ale
is
in
fact
a
fairly
dark
orange
to
reddish
amber
hue
with
a
little
white
lacing
left
on
the
glass
as
one
proceeds
aroma
is
classic
belgium
fairly
strong
and
redolent
with
sweet
and
fruity
yeast
esters
caramel
malt
and
bright
floral
hops
everything
is
wellintegrated
although
the
floralherbal
hop
notes
from
genuine
saaz
are
striking
according
to
roger

with
your
usual
belgian
flare
of
banana
and
spices
only
got
one
tonight
mainly
because
it
was
the
cheapest
thing
on
the
menu
and
it
was
low
in
alcohol
because
i
still
had
to
drive
eighty
more
miles
home
not
too
crazy
if
this
beer
is
a
flanders
red
then
some
of
the
characteristics
are
right
on
but
the
sournesstartness
is
missing
recommended
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
made
in
belgium
i
would
have
thought
this
would
be
cross
between
a
british
mild
and
an
american
amber
lowhopped
pale
ale
pours
hazy
amber
not
much
head
looks
and
even
smells
a
bit
like
a
marzen
nice
caramel
and
sweet
fruity
smell
hints
of
apricots
and
maybe
peaches
taste
has
all
that
and
more
taste
is
reminiscent
of
that
style
as
well
but
obviously
aley
more
fruit
and
no
diacetyl
got
to
love
caramel
without
diacetyl
big
malt
presence
for
a
5
beer
mouthfeel
exceedingly
smooth
theres
no
apparent
hop
flavor
as
there
shouldnt
be
but
a
balancing
bitterness
is
definitely
present
amazingly
balanced
the
heavier
mouthfeel
doesnt
take
away
from
drinkability
at
all
it
goes
down
all
too
easily
de
koninck
may
not
be
as
big
and
bad
i
mean
good
as
some
of
its
belgian
brothers
but
i
think
its
a
solid
choice
and
a
bit
underrated
a
simpler
beer
than
i
had
expected
a
solid
brew
but
i
prefer
the
fruitier
orval
in
this
bracket
drinkability
a
great
entry
level
belgian
beer
extremely
easy
to
drink
somewhat
interesting
but
not
challenging
or
distinctive
at
all
overall
a
welldone
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
as
good
as
some
of
its
belgian
brothers
but
certainly
drinkable
pours
a
medium
dark
amber
with
a
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
and
slight
haziness
aromas
of
bright
citrus
banana
clove
raisin
sour
apple
almost
closer
to
a
flemish
sour
style
than
a
belgian
pale
on
the
palate
i
first
get
struck
with
a
cooked
vegetal
flavor
followed
by
a
concord
grape
tinged
malt
flavor
this
finish
just
hints
at
a
hop
note
but
no
describable
bitterness
just
a
bit
dry
overall
theres
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
that
im
not
sure
i
like
its
not
the
cleanest
belgian
ive
had
either
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
does
not
hold
up
to
some
of
my
favorite
belgium
beers
worth
a
try
though
poured
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
settled
pretty
quickly
this
brew
has
very
tart
aromas
faint
yeasty
smell
musty
wood
taste
matches
the
smell
not
overwhelming
bt
tasty
tart
fruits
come
through
light
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
low
abv
make
this
a
good
sessions
beer
i
enjoyed
this
a
little
pricy
a
good
enjoyable
beer
to
enjoy
throughout
the
day
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
very
drinkable
pours
pale

with
with
a
thick
creamy
head
with
excellent
lacing

is
rich
and
bready
with
some
touches
of

primarily
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
light

flavors
soft
and
light
and
quite
smooth
in
the

with
a
touch
of
tannins
on
the
end
a
simple
pleasure
pours
a
clear
amber
with
lots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
slightly
yeasty
and
slightly
sweet
though
the
environment
i
tasted
it
at
was
probably
not
the
best
for
it
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
mature
bitterness
mouth
is
smooth
with
bubble
drinkable
yes
but
still
not
the
greatest
belgian
brew
i
have
ever
had
tastes
of
biscuits
toasted
malt
yeasty
spices
and
a
fruity
tang
the
hops
add
a
bit
of
bitterness
for
balance

drinkability
interesting
beer
with
many
good
qualities
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
again
to
see
if
the
sourness
is
standard
as
good
as
a
light
belgian
gets
a
good
summer
or
session
option
for
belgian
lovers
d
nice
enough
but
nothing
that
would
make
me
rush
to
buy
it
again
overall
nothing
spectacular
here
but
definitely
an
easy
session
beer
not
very
tasty
but
11
ounces
of
this
just
goes
down
so
quickly
that
youd
hardly
recall
anything
negative
about
it
not
worth
the
import
price
for
something
with
such
an
inflated
best
by
date
drinkability
high
a
complex
taste
that
isnt
too
strong
the
perfect
choice
for
a
session
beer
or
for
food
accompaniment
good
but
not
great
ive
had
a
few
before
this
one
and
it
never
blows
me
away
standard
stuff
but
for
belgian
beer
that
means
its
at
least
still
worth
checking
out
overall
a
tasty
and
highly
quaffable
pale
ale
a
not
bad
speciale
but
i
am
still
puzzled
over
its
classification
as
a
flanders
red
ale
in
ba
drinkable
but
not
too
exciting
nothing
offensive
but
rather
bland
decent
session
brew
as
i
could
see
that
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
would
be
possible
but
the
beer
is
lacking
character
to
make
it
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
to
drink
more
a
very
drinkable
beer
pity
about
the
aroma
and
head
otherwise
we
would
be
looking
at
a
higher
score
and
a
true
classic
beer
notes
ehhhh
rather
lackluster
without
much
of
an
identity
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
respect
that
it
is
a
quality
offering
without
any
flaws
other
than
it
didnt
fit
my
palate
amber
with
a
huge
head
and
a
bready
nose
this
beer
is
a
truly
great
example
of
a
belgian
session
beer
malts
are
the
main
part
of
the
taste
but
the
hops
also
show
up
to
create
a
great
balance
that
makes
this
very
drinkable
the
beer
finishes
semi
sweet
with
the
nice
yeasty
tang
at
the
end
it
pours
a
amber
color
and
a
sweet
smell
in
the
taste
i
was
kind
of
anticipating
a
bit
more
then
i
got
it
it
is
just
an
amber
light
enough
but
not
to
light
easy
to
drink
and
it
pretty
much
is
what
it
is
a
standard
belgian
amber
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
but
not
my
style
beautiful
color
would
go
nicely
with
sushi
high
enjoyable
brew
a
decent
inexpensive
belgian
for
a
warm
spring
evening
there
is
nothing
belgian
about
this
weak
insipid
mouthfeel
with
flavors
reminiscent
of
homebrew
gone
bad
overly
bready
and
desert
dry
with
medicinal
hop
flavors
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
this
is
extremely
disappointing
especially
once
cost
is
factored
in
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
no
major
complaints
except
the
lack
of
a
head
its
just
that
it
doesnt
stand
out
ill
most
likely
get
this
again
as
its
usually
pretty
affordable
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
matched
the
taste
in
that
department
this
was
not
the
best
belgian
beer
ive
tasted
but
not
entirely
objectionable
but
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
330

0
brown
colour
low
head
moderate
but
pleasant
fruity
aroma
hints
of
spices
the
flavour
is
spicy
with
moderate
malts
not
very
sweet
pleasant
to
drink
relatively
high
carbonation
in
the
glass
this
is
not
an
extreme
belgian
ale
in
any
way
and
no
challenge
for
the
beer
enthusiast
but
probably
an
ale
that
most
people
will
like
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
collar
of
white
foam
light
aroma
of
toast
and
sugar
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
with
light
toasted
malt
accents
and
a
candy
like
taste
common
in
many
stronger
belgian
ales
but
not
as
pronounced
medium
bodied
and
travels
well
from
sip
to
swallow
from
previous
experience
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
beer
in
belgium
as
your
session
beer
because
its
more
interesting
than
a
pilsener
and
their
other
more
famous
beers
will
put
you
under
the
table
fast
if
you
try
to
make
a
night
of
drinking
them
exclusively
pace
yourself
with
de
koninck
not
a
great
brew
pretty
average
actually
meh
pours
out
a
dark
copper
with
a
thin
head
and
rings
of
lacing
nose
is
mostly
of
a
rich
bready
nutty
maltiness
with
a
heft
of
dried
fruits
as
well
flavor
is
of
those
rich
malts
once
again
and
some
fruity
esters
i
get
a
mix
of
both
dried
and
fresh
fruits
dark
sweet
bread
and
apple
finish
this
up
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
and
bubbly
but
doesnt
wash
off
of
the
palate
too
quickly
decent
drinkability
but
it
really
doesnt
keep
me
interested
enough
to
make
me
want
to
drink
more
than
one
tastes
like
a
yeasty
american
pa
which
i
guess
is
what
it
is
the
hops
came
in
at
the
end
and
bit
fairly
hard
odd
for
a
bpa
but
good
nonetheless
the
biscuit
and
spice
dominated
the
palate
caramel
subsided
easy
drinking
i
like
this
one
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
a
little
out
of
balance
feeling
like
more
than
5
still
an
enjoyable
beer
d
drinkability
is
fair
but
why
bother
there
are
so
many
better
belgian
pale
ales
to
spend
time
with
not
impressed
the
beer
poured
a
deep
orange
almost
light
brown
color
forming
a
12
inch
head
that
quickly
faded
leaving
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
somehow
reminded
me
of
how
a
cider
smells
the
taste
is
sweet
as
well
very
fruity
flavor
maybe
mild
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
an
interesting
ale
but
not
one
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
during
a
session
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
still
worth
the
experience
md
smooth
and
very
drinkable
would
make
an
amazing
session
beer
not
too
thick
or
heavy
probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
belgians
goes
down
easy
poundable
even
but
why
waste
your
cash
when
there
are
much
cheaper
macro
alternatives
out
there
taste
is
heavy
malts
with
some
caramel
and
some
roasted
malts
the
beer
leaves
a
dry
feeling
and
is
highly
drinkable
there
is
some
bitterness
to
balance
all
the
malt
balance
is
the
key
word
here
in
the
end
the
beer
is
little
sticky
but
that
is
just
very
little
very
enjoyable
but
i
find
it
a
bit
watery
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
brew
i
had
it
years
ago
on
tap
and
enjoyed
it
has
my
palate
changed
or
is
this
stuff
just
not
too
great
in
the
bottle
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
decent
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
and
id
be
inclined
to
get
this
one
again
to
keep
the
inside
of
my
fridge
company
in
the
future
very
creamy
and
quite
drinkable
a
decent
drinkingbeer
but
theres
little
special
about
it
330

with

great
light

amber
with
some
hard

bubbles
amongst
the
hazy
hue
and
ambiant
lighting
of
the
dining
area
good
aroma
of
spicey
amber
malts
and
roses
very
intriguing
roses
the
floral
aroma
of
this
beer
carries
over
well
to
the
tongue
like
rose
petals
and
sugar
this
is
a
great
floral
beer
mixed
with
the
normal
belgian
spices
that
those
goofballs
toss
into
their
beers
goes
down
easy
but
not
a
perfect
session
beer
because
of
the
rush
of
spice
and
flowers
amber
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
vanilla
caramel
and
mild
banana
aromatics
perhaps
a
bit
of
corn
syrup
too
flavor
wise
the
caramel
evolves
into
more
burnt
toffee
territory
peppery
yeast
notes
appear
mid
taste
and
evaporate
into
a
slightly
bitter
and
drying
grain
husk
finish
way
more
thin
than
i
would
have
expected
considering
all
of
the
caramel
aromas
even
though
its
intended
to
be
a
lighter
style
of
belgian
ale
light
doesnt
have
to
mean
light
on
flavor
or
compexity
this
one
is
a
bit
too
light
in
both
regards
drinkability
i
hear
that
in
washington
dc
they
have
this
ontap
at
the
reef
in
adamsmorgan
and
its
known
as
de
chronic
due
to
its
popularity
and
addictivity
first
taste
is
quite
sour
then
gives
way
to
a
soaplike
taste
corn
adjcunt
seems
to
be
there
and
some
sweeter
candylike
malt
notes
very
tart
up
front
very
much
like
cherry
cough
syrup
at
times
and
the
underlying
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
finishes
herbal
with
a
taste
like
red
wine
vinegar
being
the
dominant
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
warming
mildly
carbonated
and
quite
dry
this
is
one
belgian
im
not
excited
about
at
all
i
would
find
more
than
one
to
be
altogether
too
much
no
balance
muddled
flavour
profile
and
a
little
cheap
tasting
if
i
dare
say
decent
beer
very
sweet
though
mine
was
on
tap
at
a
nearby
restaurant
i
only
ordered
it
after
my
first
two
choices
were
out
served
in
a
proper
glass
at
an
appropriate
temperature
my
biggest
complaint
besides
the
sweetness
would
be
the
level
of
carbonation
i
didnt
think
it
was
carbonated
enough
at
all
not
sure
if
this
is
typical
or
a
product
of
the
tap
d
at
5
abv
hell
yes
incredibly
drinkable
if
you
want
your
socks
knocked
off
by
huge
flavor
this
isnt
your
beer
but
its
subtle
wellcrafted
and
enjoyable
to
the
end
recommended
it
would
go
well
with
moules
et
frittes
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
a
bit
oily
easy
drinker
that
is
well
worth
taking
for
a
test
drive
this
belgian
ale
poured
a
nice
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
fresh
toasty
earthy
some
sweet
fruitness
and
a
slight
hop
spice
the
taste
is
also
fresh
and
full
very
smooth
some
toasty
malty
flavors
bit
of
cinnamon
dusty
nice
grassy
hop
bite
in
the
back
and
some
yeast
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
imploring
you
to
taste
again
an
exellent
belgian
pale
ale
very
freahsmooth
and
drinkable
brew
id
pick
this
up
again
if
i
saw
it
at
a
decent
price
in
a
six
pack
but
there
wasnt
anything
really
memorable
unlike
a
few
other
belgian
offerings
ive
had
that
would
make
me
actively
seek
this
one
out
not
a
bad
pale
but
nothing
really
stood
out
i
think
this
may
have
been
my
first
belgian
pale
ale
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
too
i
enjoyed
this
greatly
on
tap
i
will
gladly
drink
this
again
pours
a
dark
amber
the
head
shows
its
self
only
if
it
is
forced
and
then
runs
away
showing
not
a
trace
the
smell
however
mild
is
probably
the
best
thing
it
has
going
for
it
this
might
be
o
k
for
some
foods
the
way
bland
crackers
are
so
as
to
appreciate
the
cheese
more
but
definantly
not
interesting
for
a
solo
drinking
beer
i
am
sure
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
not
the
worst
but
surely
not
even
close
to
the
best
d
very
nice
belgian
ale
nice
to
find
it
on
tap
for
a
change
on
of
the
few
belgain
that
could
be
a
sessional
and
a
darn
good
one
too
d
pretty
boring
and
unassuming
one
of
the
weaker
belgian
offerings
on
the
market
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
beer
at
the
sharp
edge
medium
amber
body
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
but
there
were
lighter
amber
highlights
that
almost
seemed
to
sparkle
the
aroma
had
a
hint
of
malt
and
fruit
but
nothing
exceptional
the
taste
was
smooth
perfectly
balanced
hops
and
malt
with
a
nice
bit
of
character
that
must
have
been
from
the
yeast
finishes
a
little
dry
but
this
lends
to
its
drinkability
enjoyed
the
second
half
of
this
beer
with
dinner
and
i
must
say
it
goes
very
well
with
food
not
a
unique
beer
when
compared
with
other
belgian
ales
but
a
very
solid
balanced
wellcrafted
ale
mouth
this
beer
tastes
precisely
how
it
smells
with
big
berry
flavors
up
front
and
a
drier
sourbitter
hop
finish
in
the
back
its
very
fizzy
upon
entering
but
smooth
by
the
time
its
ready
to
be
swallowed
leaves
a
gentle
bitterness
behind
and
completely
masks
the
taste
of
alcohol
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
beer
might
be
a
decent
session
beer
it
has
a
slightly
graiting
flavor
but
with
the
relatively
low
alcohol
it
is
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
odd
finish
i
wouldnt
enjoy
drinking
more
of
it
if
this
is
a
belgian
pale
ale
its
one
on
steroids
served
in
appropriate
de
koninck
glassware
appearance
was
amber
and
very
clear
with
a
fair
size
head
i
did
not
pick
up
much
from
the
aroma
beyond
the
usual
malt
and
hop
mix
but
neither
seemed
to
predominate
the
taste
was
well
balanced
but
hops
seemd
to
come
through
more
strongly
i
picked
up
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
very
drinkable
as
the
dry
taste
keeps
you
coming
back
poured
to
a
bright
copper
with
suspended
yeast
absolutely
no
head
or
lacing
it
had
a
very
weak
aroma
of
some
spice
may
have
been
cinnamon
flavor
of
cinnamon
and
hops
but
had
a
dry
sour
finish
i
have
three
more
and
will
try
these
but
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
especially
for
a
belgian
ale
light
body
nice
stuff
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
medium
off
white
head
that
looks
like
its
going
to
stick
around
smells
of
malts
mild
hops
and
a
bit
of
raisin
highly
carbonated
and
feels
almost
like
a
cider
quite
odd
taste
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
even
though
its
only
slightly
above
5
abv
i
can
still
taste
the
alcohol
however
it
does
have
some
pretty
decent
malt
flavors
and
a
smidgen
of
hops
i
dont
know
just
something
about
this
belgian
im
not
really
digging
too
much
oh
well
at
99cents
it
was
worth
a
try
i
could
probably
put
down
a
lot
of
these
on
a
night
out
clubbing
in
antwerp
as
its
certainly
much
more
pelasing
than
an
american
macro
but
not
very
interesting
not
one
of
the
best
belgian
ales
ive
had
but
its
not
bad
either
d
awesome
i
finished
half
a
pint
before
i
knew
it
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
d
a
very
tasty
smooth
drinking
belgian
that
doesnt
overwhelm
you
with
the
candy
sugar
or
fruitiness
you
find
in
a
lot
of
belgians
on
the
other
hand
i
was
not
blown
away
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
drinkability
and
overall
a
classic
the
perfect
easy
drinking
yet
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
belgian
ale
definitly
one
thats
perfect
for
a
session
you
need
to
sit
with
this
one
for
a
little
bit
but
its
at
the
very
least
pretty
good
i
really
like
this
one
pours
out
a
clear
but
deep
ruddy
copper
hue
small
fizzle
of
offwhite
head
with
little
retention
the
aroma
is
predominantly
chewy
caramel
malt
with
light
notes
of
floral
hops
things
get
a
little
screwy
in
the
flavour
dept
metallic
and
grainy
at
first
never
saw
that
coming
then
theres
more
of
a
toasted
malt
profile
in
the
middle
with
some
of
that
sweet
caramel
malt
coming
out
towards
the
finish
where
some
grassy
almost
herbal
hops
make
an
appearance
for
some
reason
this
all
just
doesnt
come
together
for
me
it
turns
me
off
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
average
neither
too
watery
nor
very
full
perhaps
this
bottle
didnt
receive
the
tenderest
of
treatment
from
the
brewery
eventually
to
my
glass
but
assumptions
aside
i
have
to
go
by
what
ive
sampled
and
i
found
this
to
be
an
ale
that
does
nothing
for
me
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
in
my
books
d
very
drinkable
very
drinkable
and
only
5

nice
to
find
a

belgian
that
wont
knock

on

a

was
easier

like

the

this
is
a
light
but
flavorful
belgian
ale
veryvery
drinkable
i
wish
it
were
available
here
all
year
i
would
not
drink
this
in
large
quantities
but
would
enjoy
it
as
a
one
off
or
perhaps
with
smoked
meats
or
pickled
apperitefs
this
is
a
really
great
belgian
pale
ale
it
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
all
the
flavors
are
well
represented
and
nothing
dominates
it
should
be
bottle
conditioned
though
the
flavor
was
ok
but
it
did
leave
me
wanting
more
it
wasnt
the
freshest
bottle
so
this
might
account
for
some
of
my
disappointment
the
flavor
seemed
quite
weak
not
nearly
as
strong
as
other
belgian
ales
that
ive
had
330
ml
best
by
112305
served

up

it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
prickly
at
first
but
becomes
smooth
at
first
it
reminded
me
of
an
american
pale
or
amber
but
the
phenols
and
yeast
traits
became
stronger
and
let
you
know
it
is
indeed
a
belgian
overall
it
is
a
delicious
belgian
pale
with
a
nice

kick
comments
this
is
a
very
nice
complex
beer
imo
and
i
was
surprised
when
i
saw
the
overall
rating
it
has
received
i
think
this
beer
is
oddly
underrated
here
on
ba
competent
worth
trying
this
belgian
pours
with
a
redpinkamber
color
that
made
me
a
little
nervous
the
taste
was
okay
but
the
finish
left
me
hanginglooking
for
so
much
more
it
starts
off
allright
with
a
hint
of
cream
trying
to
break
through
but
then
doesnt
with
the
middle
there
was
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
the
finish
just
wasnt
there
i
probably
wont
go
back
to
this
one
because
there
are
so
many
other
belgians
of
higher
quality
out
there
however
i
know
the
rep
for
this
brew
and
would
like
to
give
it
another
chance
along
with
their
cuvee
overall
a
good
one
and
one
i
would
definitely
buy
again
this
time
checking
the
freshness
dating
because
if
this
is
old
id
imagine
it
would
be
awesome

a
very
drinkable

overall

finally
got
to
try
this
exclusive
at
a
wetherspoons
pub
in
norwich
id
been
wanting
to
try
it
since
i
heard
about
it
a
classic
belgian
pale
ale
served
from
a
cask
it
wasnt
a
disappointment
if
you
like
dekoninck
youll
definitely
like
this
its
subtle
flavors
are
well
less
subtle
i
e
that
cinnamon
component
is
a
little
more
pronounced
and
you
get
more

as
an
intriguing
and
pleasant
hybrid
of

bitter

belgian

i
find
it
much
sweeter
and
richer
in
body
than
its
normal
keg
version
but
still
think
the
original
version
tastes
fresher
and
more
quaffable
especially
when
i
tasted
it
on
tap
in
antwerp
so
give
the

back
to

of

scent
with

the
mouth
is

prickly

cloying

reasonably
light
the
taste
opens
slightly
sour
perhaps
cherry
which
nicely
complements
the
bready
malt
taste
a
noticeable
dry
hops
bitterness
joins
the
party
somewhat
later
making
for
a
fairly
complex
flavor
profile
the
usual
francophone
fruity
twang
is
here
but
the
hops
provide
nice
balance
the
aftertaste
brings
back
the
sour
cherry

very
pleasant
multifaceted
brew
what
a
weird
looking
beer
seems
to
be

it

nondescript
flavor
is
pleasant
malty
and
wih
a
gentle
slight

bite
not
a
complex
beer
clean
and
simple
nice
drinkability
and
pleasant
but
not
a
lot
going
on
i
have
heard
that
it
is
better
on
tap
in
antwerp
i
cant
wait
to
find
out
because
this
did
not
grab
me
not
much

filmy
head
adorning
this
clear

the
aroma
is

a
spicy
dry
nutty
start
spice
persists
through
the
somewhat
water
middle
not
very

there
is
some
lemon

its
not
bad
nutty

a

but
a

but
just
underwhelming

guess
a
belgian

but
better

with
a

in
the

with
an
understated

and
dominated

the
finish
is
grassy

earthy
with
a
light

tingle
not
bad
at
all
easy
to
drink
though
certainly
not
exciting
a
good
summer
beer
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
like
stronger
brews
this
beer
reminded
me
of
ginger
ale
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
light
carbonated
even
looks
like
canada
dry
certainly
refreshing
and
there
is
nothing
unpleasant
about
this
beer
better
than
a
majority
of
lagers
but
not
as
good
as
most
ales
kind
of
a
strange

and
a
dry
finish
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
in
respect
of
the
ontap
versions
one
word
of
warning
this
beer
can
taste
rough
acidic
and
sharp
if
you
are
unlucky
some
cafés
dont
sell
enough
of
it
or
maybe
the
stuff
left
in
the
pipes
from
last
night
doesnt
get
flushed
out
before
they
start
pouring
again
in
the
morning
but
just
note
that
if
your
first
one
doesnt
taste
good
it
might
not
be
your
fault
complain
and
they
will
will
give
you
another

cl
overall
one
of
the
few
belgium
beers
that
is
distinctly
better
on
draft
then
from
the
bottle
a
nice
bottled
offering
and
my
marks
reflect
that
i
have
an
aged
sample
though
not
out
of
date
a
bolleke
of
this
in
antwerp
served
on
tap
with
a
swirl
of
yeast
of
course
really
does
still
take
some
beating
maybe
better
when
fresher
in
the
bottle
dont
leave
it
too
long
in
the
fridge
or
buy
older
sample
of
it
would
be
my
advice
sampled
on
tap
at
an
outdoor
cafe
in
the
antwerp
city
centre
reubans
section
this
stuff
is
excellent
the
appearance
is
dark
golden
with
a
lovely
white
head
the
aromas
are
of
alcohol
various
spices
sugar
yeast
and
hops
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
up
front
malty
in
the
middle
and
bitter
hoppy
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
nice
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
pours
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
weak
head
and
poor
retention
at
that
yet
it
is
lively
and
effervescent
the
smell
is
of
bread
fruit
and
a
grassy
background
the
flavor
has
a
crisp
start
sweet
middle
and
a
dry
spicy
finish
the
feel
is
smooth
and
slippery
with
a
balanced
effervescence
and
a
lingering
dryness
the
yeast
in
this
is
pretty
distinctive
it
definitely
carries
a
belgian
quality
but
for
stands
out
from
others
in
its
distinct
fruity
spiciness
creating
a
nice
underlying
profile
of
aromas
and
flavors
that
ties
the
different
aspects
of
the
malt
and
hops
together
with
its
own
interest
this
beer
was
ok
a
fairly
standard
example
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
nice
and
easy
drinking
but
nothing
to
make
me
feel
like
i
needed
another
one
really
not
too
much
flavor
in
this
beer
overall
it
is
just
lacking
in
those
flavorful
beer
qualities
i
quickly
moved
on
to
a
duvel
that
i
saw
on
the
menu
you
should
too
drinkability

this
would
make
a
good
session
bier
imo
i
didnt
much
care
for
it
personally
though
for
the
price
this
is
a
great
beer
a
couple
dollars
cheaper
than
most
other
belgians
on
tap
another
one
that
id
have
one
or
two
more
of
just
so
sweet

many

that
wouldnt
be
likely

unfortunately
the
taste
is

there
is

especially
with
spicy

is
topped
with
a

colored

which
fades
fairly
quick
and
then
leaves
some
belgium

on
the
nose
the

the

a
clean
yeasty
taste
with
a
decent
supply
of

hops
in
balance
its
kind
of
watery
but
not
without
flavor
therefore
its
quite
refreshing
served
cold
its
pretty
smooth
with
a
toasty
finish
after
finishing
one
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
another
maybe
due
to
the
11
2
fl
oz
sized
bottle
or
maybe
due
to
the
slightly
complicated
nature
of
this
refreshing
ale
the
appearance
is
nice
pleasant
amber
color
clear
medium
head
with
slight

the
mouthfeel
was
soft
with
a
nice

the
aroma
after
the
initial
shot
of
saaz
hops
was
followed
with
a
light
malt
and
sweet

character
taste
had
the
similar
sweet
water
quality
like
a
na
some
dryness
and
bitterness
on
finish
but
not
necessarily
pleasant
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
interested
in
a
trial
of
belgian
beers
i
liked
the
nice
dark
goldorange
color
with
nice
headsmelled
very
malty
with
some
spiciness
in
there
first
sip
was
sweet
and
as
i
drank
more
a
nuttiness
a
appearedit
has
somewhat
of
a
dry
finishgood
well
rounded
highly
drinkable
belgianale
would
love
to
try
on
tap
sometime
in
the
future
this
ale
poured
an
amber
color
with
modest
white
foam
the
smell
was
also
modest
malt
and
some
musty
grape
scent
characteristic
for
many
belgian
ales
the
taste
was
malty
with
the
telltale
musty
grape
flavor
as
well
as
some
floral
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
clean
with
medium
body
light
carbonation
and
low
bitterness
the
drinkability
was
good
very
clean
and
refreshing
pat
pours
hazy

only
a

brew
with
a

taste
is

toasted

malts
up

followed
by
a

flavor
middle
has
notes
of
doughy
yeasts
and
lots
of
spice
such
as
vanilla
clove
and
allspice
fruity
towards
the
end
with
notes
of
ripe
apple
and
a
touch
of
plum
with
a
dry
finish
i
prefer
their
cuvee
beer
to
this
one
but
this
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
the
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
fruity
and
plummy
flavors
and
also
very
malty
its
remeniscent
of
many
belgian
stong
ales
but
without
the
high
abv
overall
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
it
would
be
even
better
on
tap
has
a
slight
spicy
yeast
flavor
that
bubbles
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
extreme
smoothness
is
accompanied
by
a
fruitiness
and
a
slight
caramel
taste
as
well
an
exceptional
ale
pairing
well
with
my
block
of
horseradish
white
cheddar
mild
and
easy
to
drink
yet
full
of
flavor
and
delicious
worth
finding
what
can
you
say
this
is
just
another
fine
belgian
beer
the
fine
blend
of
malt
hops
is
not
necessarily
exceptional
but
is
noteworthy
they
definitely
know
what
they
are
doing
i
prefer
the
cuvee
to
this
one
but
i
still
really
enjoy
the
flavor
very
smooth
and
clean
on
the
palate
with
an
enjoyable
nose
to
compliment
the
flavor
i
had
this
with
a
chicken
in
pesto
sauce
cheese
which
turned
out
to
be
a
great
combination
again
i
will
highly
recommend
this
one
to
try
and
it
will
not
be
unusual
to
find
it
in
my
fridge
at
home
the
taste
is
very
simple
sweet
malts
followed
by
a
welcomed
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
but
it
is
just
good
i
cant
pick
out
exactly
what
i
like
but
i
guess
it
is
just
the
balance
and
the
hops
at
the
end
it
is
mediumbodied
and
very
smooth
with
some
tingling
carbonation
at
the
start
towards
the
end
it
gets
a
bit
richer
and
more
full
flavored
with
nice
spicy
hops
throughout
balancing
the
malts
at
the
start
and
dominating
the
finish
this
is
simply
a
great
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
copper
tone
and
filled
with
a
white
frothing
head
that
was
shortlived
some
hints
of
some
hop
aroma
but
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
more
apparent
at
first
taste
all
that
i
could
detect
was
the
the
vienna
malts
after
letting
the
beer
sit
for
a
little
i
noticed
that
this
beer
is
very
simple
in
flavor
with
some
mild
hopping
but
what
makes
this
beer
great
is
that
its
finish
is
so
crisp
and
smooth
that
this
beer
is
a
satisfying
treat
to
be
experienced
first
sip
is
malty
with
a
spicypeppery
finish
from
the
hops
very
well
balanced
reminds
me
of
a
blonde
bock
but
not
as
strong
goes
down
easy
and
will
be
trying
to
brew
it
asap
pours
with
a
firm
just
offwhite
head
over
an
attractive
copperyamber
liquid
nose
is
of
newmown
hay
very
delicate
aromas
taste
is
malty
though
not
heavyhanded
maltiness
leaves
a
clean
aftertaste
on
the
palate
very
little
hoppiness
to
speak
of
light
bodied
finish
makes
a
very
agreeable
session
beer
if
i
found
this
on
draught
it
would
be
very
easy
to
put
alot
of
this
away

the
high

of
this
beer
could
not
taste
anything

was
disappointed
with
the

after
taste

rise
up

the

is
quite

aroma
has
a
pronounced
medicinal
quality
with
underlying
sweet
and

notes
taste
begins
with

flavors
then
flows
into
a
distinct
apple
peel
taste
accompanied
by
spices
among
them
cloves
i
think
finish
is
dry
with
a
hopped
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
an
excellent
beer
clear
deep
reddishcopper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
holds
ok
and
leaves
a
good
collar
with
some
whispy
surface
foam
and
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
bold
and
welcoming
with
a
gently
dark
fruitiness
a
soft
spiciness
some
toasted
maltiness
and
a
light
suggestion
of
hops
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
very
fine
and
somewhat
limited
carbonation
level
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
caress
on
the
tongue
from
the
gentle
effervescence
the
flavor
is
delicate
with
a
toasted
biscuity
maltiness
from
vienna
malts
a
light
spiciness
i
think
from
both
the
yeast
or
a
possible
spice
addition
and
the
saaz
hops
and
some
medicinal
phenols
that
smooth
as
the
beer
warms
well
balanced
the
finish
is
short
and
dry
with
just
a
minimal
lingering
earthiness
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
continually
beckons
you
to
have
another
sip
very
clean
and
crisp
quite
surprisingly
full
of
character
though
not
complex
for
a
beer
that
starts
at
only
11
8
plato
this
is
what
i
think
of
as
a
standard
belgian
artisinal
ale
well
worth
seeking
out
and
probably
worth
buying
by
the
case
this
is
a
beer
id
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
i
have
to
work
on
how
to
get
some
in
my
local
liquor
stores
or
even
better
get
it
on
tap
if
that
is
possible
a
very
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
nice
and
dry
with
hints
of
clove
cinamon
caramel
great
on
tap
and
great
to
have
a
lot
of
good
stuff
but
perhaps
a
bit
expensive
outside
of
belgium
de
koninck
is
being
sold
in
gift
packs
with
a
bolleke
the
glass
its
traditionally
served
in
warm
malty
aroma
with
visible
flecks
floating
in
the
beer
this
must
be
an
old
bottle
still
tastes
just
fine
yeast
imparts
a
tang
and
spiciness
to
what
otherwise
feels
like
a
soft
malty
british
ale
quite
refreshing
without
being
too
vigorous
comfortable
and
full
of
character
well
balanced
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
belgian
style
had
this
on
tap
and
a
fine
brew
it
is
very
smooth
on
the
palate
not
as
complex
as
some
belgian
beers
but
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
amber
colored
with
dense
head
mild
yeast
spiciness
and
toastednutty
malt
flavors
that
blend
into
one
another
well
i
wish
i
lived
in
antwerp
so
that
i
could
call
this
my
local
brew
good
in
a
bottle
better
on
tap
nice
golden
color
good
lacey
head
a
nutty
malty
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
if
it
werent

a

a

amazing
floral
bouquet
finish
is
a
bit
lacking
very
drinkable
sharp
hoppy
notes
combined
with

ipa
love
this

whoa
whoa
whoa
got
to
pull
back
the
reins
on
this
one
big

american

jam
packed

crazy
just
not

bpa
overall
a
nice
americanized
take
on
the
style
o
solid
offering
from
revolution
the
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
due
to
the
beers
high
level
of
drinkability
highly
recommend
for
fans
of
belgian
beers
as
well
as
hopheads
this
beer
can
appeal
to
many
palates
overall
impression
a
firmly
belgian
american
hopped
ale
immensely
enjoyable
and
poundable
im
biased
as
i
love
this
brewery
and
this
is
another
solid
offering
too
aromatic
for
my
taste
with
strong
citrus
notes
get
some
try
some
i
love
belgians
and
i
like
pale
ales
but
this
beer
isnt
really
a
great
specimen
of
either
probably
refreshing
during
the
summer
but
not
the
best
fit
for
this
cold
february
day
overall
im
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
actually
would
consider
getting
more
of
it
nearly
almost
being
a
double
ipa
it
still
manages
to
be
very
sessionable
when
its
really
cold
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
citra
fix
great
beer
cant
go
wrong
too
dark
a
beer
for
my
taste
solid
belgo
pale
ale
seasonal
release
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
hop
bomb
by
the
aroma
but
it
was
balanced
to
say
the
least
interesting
hodgepodge
of
flavor
here
i
would
recommend
this
to
fans
of
americanbelgian
ales
extremely
drinkable
clean
very
aromatic
with
belgian
and
hop
qualities
a
little
on
the
dry
side
which
makes
for
a
nice
mouth
feel
overall
very
nice
but
a
little
too
hoppy
for
a
belgian
ale
style
if
you
ask
me
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
server
told
me
this
was
a
belgian
beer
but
it
doesnt
taste
that
way
more
of
a
hoppy
pale
ale
delicious
so
good
i
had
5
thanks

i
love
this

fine
foam
flavors
of
lemon
and
brioche
with
a
buttery
rich
textured
finish
revolution
continues
to
blow
me
away
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
ive
always
bee
a
sucker
for
citra
belgian
style
yeast
but
this
pale
goes
above
and
beyond
crazy
its
a
tasty
brew
i
have
to
admit
beer
prior
to
this
different
brands
kind
of
sucked
so
this
was
really
good
lots
of
hops
but
also
malts
and
some
spices
as
well
love
revolution
brews
belgian
style
there
is
nothing
belgian
style
about
this
beer
it
is
much
darker
than
any
true
bpa
would
be
the
head
is
weaker
than
a
unics
sex
drive
and
there
is
no
hint
at
all
of
the
floral
notes
and
effervescence
associated
with
belgian
ales
and
yeast
with
that
being
said
this
is
a
decent
american
style
pale
ale
it
is
completely
drinkable
with
complex
and
balanced
hop
character
that
everyone
is
used
to
by
now
with
the
ridiculous
amount
of
apas
out
there
brewed
by
craft
breweries
in
the
us
a
personal
favorite
from
revolution
wonderful
little
beer
smooth
and
sessionable
get
it
on
tap
if
you
can
never
would
have
even
thought
to
try
this
style
of
beer
until
i
tried
this
one
beautiful
almost
perfumelike
aroma
earlier
batch
in
a
bomber
wasnt
as
good
a
nice
combination
the
brewer
put
together
plenty
of
hop
flavor
without
going
into
belgian
ipa
area
of
bitterness
o
really
digging
it
would
mine
getting
more
i
seem
to
be
going
against
the
grain
here
but
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
can
so
im
sure
that
didnt
help
although
i
thought
the
eugene
porter
from
revolution
held
up
pretty
well
in
a
can
but
this
beer
is
more
delicate
i
suppose
it
tasted
very
thin
and
highly
carbonated
with
a
sweetsour
kick
i
guess
thats
the
fruity
elements
and
the
funky
elements
would
not
buy
again
oan
easy
drinker
with
nice
tropical
fruit
and
malt
backbone
o
an
interesting
brew
and
worth
a
try
overall
this
a
very
affordable
and
drinkable
and
excellent
brew
i
homebrewed
a
clone
thats
conditioning
at
the
moment
so
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
we
used
magnum
citra
and
cascade
hops
our
tribute
to
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
brewery
too
viva
the
revolution
overall
its
a
very
tasty
belgium
pale
ale
not
super
hop
forward
like
say
a
belgium
ipa
but
still
very
smooth
and
fruity
tasting
pour
is
bright
amber
orange
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
has
a
fair
bit
of
resin
hop
up
front
light
yeast
notes
with
a
fair
bit
of
spice
and
tang
a
good
bit
of
sweet
juicy
citrus
and
faint
grassy
hop
in
the
back
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
light
tangy
yeast
with
a
hint
of
spice
loads
of
pine
and
resin
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
some
grassy
bitterness
through
the
finish
but
light
body
is
syrupy
and
full
softer
carbonation
overall
an
absolutely
wonderful
brew
will
go
back
to
this
one
again
and
again
insanely
drinkable
with
so
much
going
on
love
the
combination
of
this
being
a
traditional
american
pale
with
a
great
belgian
base
revolution
is
absolutely
killing
it
right
now
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
drinks
like
a
belgian
ipa
to
me
its
well
crafted
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
love
to
drink
this
during
the
summer
pretty
impressive
stuff
right
here
overall
not
much
i
can
fault
this
beer
on
maybe
if
they
did
add
some
hibiscus
this
one
would
really
pop
love
this
one
will
be
buying
a
lot
more
this
beer
pours
hazy

with
a
thick
frothy

and
leaves
a
nice
thin
lacing
on
glass
it
smells
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
with
hits
of
grapefruit
and
lemon
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
but
very
hoppy
with
hints
of
honey
overall
great
beer
active
carbonation
supports
both
the
flowing
smoothness
and
the
crispness
of
this
lighter
style
of
which
this
beer
verges
into
stronger
territory
by
achieving
a
medium
body
its
about
semidry
most
of
the
way
into
an
easy
finish
o
i
really
like
this
especially
for
5
so
much
so
my
score
may
not
do
it
justice
complex
a
bit
different
and
very
tasty
i
would
definitely
consider
this
a
musttry

to

real
real

which
isnt

thing
but
the
flavor
is
exactly
how
the
brewers
intended
it
to
be
imo
see
what
you
think
overall
quite
tasty
the
tropical

work
very
well
overall
a
damn
well
done
belgian
delicious
grab
a

overall
other
than

brings
a

this
i
could
have
scored
it

this
an

to
an

like
light

mouthfeel
the
a
little
crazy
ale
from
revolution
is
ok
the
beer
poured
a
fairly
clear
copper
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
leaving
a
lace
the
scent
definitely
has
belgian
style
pale
al
all
over
it
the
taste
has
the
belgium
white
flare
with
a
subtle
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgium
style
pale
ales
mouthfeel
has
a
vinigar
like
stickiness
that
is
cut
by
a
belgian

just

i
was
pleasantly
surprised
but
this
one
id
never
heard
of
it
and
loved
it
from
start
to
finish
big
citra
notes
with
a
mellow
belgian
twist
id
be
drinking
this
often
i
i
could
buy
it
in
my
part
of
the
world
subtly
sweet
yeast
dry
citrus
zest
faint
juicy

banana
little
bit
of
hop

smooth
and
drinkable
really
surprised
by
this
one
a
really
damn
good
hoppy
american
style
belgian
ale
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
west
coast
ipa
with
a
belgian
yeasty
taste
in
the
background
12oz
can
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
frothy
eggshell
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
fruity
and
juicy
nose
with
plenty
of
citrus
especially
orange
rind
some
bready
malt
and
yeast
fresh
tasting
with
more
orange
and
citrus
juicy
caramel
bready
belgian
yeast
medium
body
ample
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
would
buy
it
again
it
was
both
refreshing
and
complex
with
nice
balance
of
flavors
m
light
to
medium
bodied
strong
earthy
bitterness
from
the
start
and
only
a
little
fruity
yeast
to
attempt
to
balance
it
out
add
some
malty
crackers
to
the
mix
but
hops
still
dominate
most
of
the
flavor
profile
mild
resiny
palate
this
is
one
hoppy
bpa
just
a
little
too
hoppy
to
be
on
my
session
list
though
a
better
than
average
belgian
style
pale
ale
o
overall
a
nice
combination
of
spice
and
hops
slight
malty
sweetness
i
strongly
prefer
this
over
anti
hero
last
batch
was
too
vegetative
this
just
pops
a
handsome
yellow
pale
ale
was
poured
from
the
can
into
a
glass
with
a
bright
white
head
noting
the
bubbles
the
ale
was
aggressively
carbonated
while
leaving
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
the
aroma
it
smells
quite
biscuity
with
mild
earthy
notes
in
the
initial
taste
the
beer
is
citrusy
with
notes
of
yeast
biscuit
and
mild
pine
the
carbonation
does
not
allow
the
initial
taste
to
linger
for
a
significant
duration
in
the
aftertaste
it
evolves
into
a
more
dry
taste
with
hints
of
grape
skin
and
biscuit
at
this
point
this
is
mild
favorite
from
revolution
being
an
easy
drinker
with
a
complex
taste
o
for
the
style
this
is
quite
nice
easy
drinking
and
lightly
crisp
without
pummeling
your
palate
with
a
hop
or
yeast
bomb
would
be
a
great
beer
for
springsummer
time
in
addition
tried
it
out
of
a
can
and
really
liked
it
25
on
the
score
for
that
it
pours
darker
than
a
bpa
and
clearer
with
little
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
mild
for
an
american
style
but
just
right
for
authentic
style
the
taste
is
over
the
top
yeasty
and
hoppy
as
mentioned
before
american
the
aftertaste
as
well
compared
to
those
other
over
the
top
americans
this
one
is
pretty
well
balanced
but
it
is
very
tasty
the
aftertaste
is
tart
and
yeasty
and
bitter
pretty
darn
good
o
fantastic
beer
so
glad
its
in
cans
need
to
stock
up
certainly
worth
a
buy
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
looked
very
nice
a
lighter
amber
color
with
only
25
5
inch
of
offwhite
head
crystal
clear
the
smell
was
also
very
nice
mostly
malt
with
some
slight
spice
not
much
hops
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
very
good
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
despite
the
aroma
with
a
mediumlight
mouthfeel
i
felt
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
an
easy
drink
ill
definitely
have
it
again
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
hop
bombs
that
are
so
prevalent
today
o
a
really
nice
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
ale
it
is
not
a
standout
beer
but
it
also
doesnt
have
anything
working
against
it
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
not
something
i
would
typically
drink
but
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
o
this
beer
goes
excellent
with
any
food
however
on
its
own
it
lacks
complexity
and
some
more
flavor
really
expecting
more
aromatics
also
overall
really
nice
belgian
pale
ale
didnt
blow
the
doors
off
but
really
solid
all
around
nice
local
beer
made
by
revolution
a
little
crazy
drinkable
only
complain
is
lack
of
a
head
way
to
go
revolution
o
this
is
a
nice
big
pale
ale
with
a
good
balance
of
fruity
yeast
character
and
hops
it
is
very
drinkable
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
to
big
as
it
opens
up
o
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
or
belgian
ipa
awesome
hop
aroma
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
a
great
bpa
with
a
distinct
american
edge
poured
into
tulip
glass
appearance
is
bright
clear
golden
and
pale
thin
white
head
collar
with
minimal
head
present
some
lacing
is
there
aroma
features
a
happy
combo
of
american
chops
and
belgian
yeast
with
an
emphasis
on
the
former
notes
of
mango
grapefruit
sit
atop
delicate
belgian
esters
this
brew
drinks
like
an
ipa
fresh
hoppy
and
crisp
only
difference
is
that
belgian
twinge
at
the
end
this
provides
a
touch
of
spice
that
pairs
well
with
residual
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
i
am
again
fully
satisfied
with
yet
another
revolution
product
if
you
havent
sought
these
guys
out
what
are
you
waiting
for
d
this
was
a
nice
hoppy
belgian
and
it
was
easy
to
get
through
most
of
the
bomber
on
my
own
hope
this
is
a
regular
bottled
offering
from
revolution
as
i
like
it
more
than
the
wit
and
the
saison
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
very
approachable
bpa
personally
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
more
aggressive
but
i
imagine
this
was
brewed
to
be
a
gateway
beer
22oz
bomber
pours
dark
orange
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
not
overwhelming
taste
is
complex
layered
fantastic
great
beer
im
really
starting
to
like
this
new
niche
belgium
style
pale
ales
its
the
best
of
american
and
uk
methods
to
make
such
a
diverse
style
time
for
dinner
so
i
might
as
well
give
this
belgiany
guy
a
go
he
pours
a
mostly
clear
sunset
ambergold
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
grapefruit
zest
mild
pine
sap
light
pineapple
light
black
pepper
and
a
touch
of
what
seems
to
be
passion
fruit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
pine
is
a
bit
more
assertive
and
the
belgian
yeast
kicks
in
a
bit
more
adding
some
mild
notes
of
black
pepper
clove
and
cardamom
while
also
bringing
out
some
of
the
more
lemony
tones
from
the
hops
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bpa
with
some
tastily
bright
hops
but
i
do
kinda
wish
the
belgian
yeast
were
more
prominent
oh
well
it
works
well
enough
now
resiny
orange
zest
hop
oils
creamy
smooth
feel
with
lasting
moderate

orange
flavors
light
tropical
character
also
dry
resiny
aftertaste
fruit
forward
and
plenty
bitter
fairly
yeasty
but
doesnt
eclipse
the
hop
showcase
a
really
damn
good
belgian
pale
by
rev
i
hope
they
do
this
one
more
often
as
it
is
really
good
this
is
my
first
review
will
get
better
with
the
details
in
the
future
overall
a
quite
tasty
and
more
sessionalble
belgian
pale
ale
while
not
quite
to
the
level
of
its
bottle
fermented
brethren
it
is
very
crisp
and
tasty
none
the
less
and
makes
for
a
very
delicious
brew
fairly
clear
straw
with
a
lingering
head
of
white
foam
aroma
is
floral
with
lemon
zest
and
belgian
yeast
funk
theres
a
bit
of
spice
and
perfumey
notes
flavor
is
lemony
and
minerally
with
a
cracker
malt
backbone
very
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
great
balance
of
bitter
finish
and
citrus
character
oa
tasty
belgian
pale
that
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
one
area
i
found
the
9
pour
to
be
somewhat
ridiculous
but
thats
the
bars
fault
i
will
take
the
traditional
duvel
over
this
every
time
but
i
havent
stumbled
upon
this
on
draft
before
and
trust
the
brand
enough
to
spend
the
money
o
this
is
what
i
tell
every
customer
it
is
a
mellower
more
easydrinking
version
of
duvel
as
if
duvel
sr
is
laborious
to
drink
most
casual
or
lessadventurous
beer
drinkers
really
dig
it
while
some
feel
its
too
restrained
pleases
most
though
a
nice
lighter
belgian
ale
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
satisfying
not
as
good
as
the
standard
duvel
but
worth
trying
o
so
they
tweaked
the
duvel
recipe
for
draught
i
guess
i
kind
of
get
it
the
bottled
version
of
duvel
does
not
lend
itself
to
the
tap
lines
mainly
due
to
its
strength
so
they
take
the
abv
down
a
little
lighten
the
body
to
make
it
more
sessionable
and
make
it
noticeably
more
hoppy
for
good
measure
this
is
america
after
all
its
still
a
very
good
beer
just
not
the
duvel
i
know
and
love
it
feels
just
a
little
dumbed
down
in
all
respects
compared
to
its
bottled
counterpart
the
real
problem
is
the
name
putting
single
on
the
bottle
in
a
belgian
context
will
lead
people
to
believe
that
this
is
modeled
after
an
abbey
single
certainly
not
the
case
at
6
8
abv
maybe
they
should
just
make
a
beer
more
akin
to
an
abbey
single
for
draught
the
market
is
trending
in
that
direction
these
days
anyway
demand
for
true
session
offerings
is
on
the
rise
overall

i
really
really
like
this
beer
it
typifies
the
style
in
terms
of
dry
relatively
clear
golden
nonbrett
interpretationsto
a
t
other
than
not
being
as
fruity
and
not
quite
as
spicy
as
a
lot
of
other
versions
of
the
style
it
takes
the
standard
and
nails
it
love
this
beer
i
really
like
this
but
cant
say
it
strikes
me
as
overally
unique
its
okay
id
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
solid
flavors
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
lot
can
be
said
about
execution
id
have
this
again
duvel
is
a
great
brewery
starts
with
a
rich
body
and
the
pale
malt
but
no
graininess
next
comes
the
sourness
followed
quickly
by
a
notable
and
balanced
hop
the
aftertaste
is
short
and
mostly
sour
the
carbonation
is
low
i
was
very
happy
to
find
it
available
on
tap
for
growlers
in
a
local
package
store
qbs
in
pojoaque
nm
overall
pretty
solid
and
better
than
the
draft
version
in
the
u
s
with
a
more
pronounced
yeast
spice
character
not
as
intriguing
as
your
standard
duvel
but
surely
more
quaffable
and
of
the
same
bloodlines
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
draftonly
offering
from
duvel
oa
very
drinkable
and
decent
pale
ale
has
some
off
flavors
but
theyre
forgivable
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
off
and
gives
the
beer
and
almost
watery
aspect
an
interesting
try
but
a
let
down
when
compared
to
its
big
brother
ontap
at
the
cheeky
monk
over
lunch
the
beer
was
served
in
a
cm
tulip
and
arrived
transparent
yellow
with
a
fingers
width
of
white
head
some
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
relatively
mild
with
hints
of
pilsner
malt
earthy
floral
hops
and
toast
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
what
is
experienced
in
the
nose
mildly
bitter
with
a
more
pronounced
bready
character
mildly
sweet
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
and
crisp
yet
smooth
moderately
carbonated
and
a
hint
of
dry
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
going
on
here
was
expecting
more
not
bad
just
not
fantastic
o
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
a
surprise
to
have
at
bjs
good
for
them
not
as
tasty
as
duvel
classic
but
perfect
with
dinner
o
this
beer
is
a
lot
easier
to
drink
compared
to
regular
duvel
and
seems
to
share
some
properties
of
a
pilsner
in
the
taste
o
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
this
was
only
the
second
time
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
but
i
will
likely
try
it
again
when
i
come
across
it
next
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
yeast
and
some
slight
fruity
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
regular
duvel
from
the
bottle
much
more
than
this
quintessential
duvel
head
billowing
and
broken
over
clear
deep
gold
body
numerous
trails
of
bubbles
rising
up
side
of
glass
fairly
hop
forward
in
the
nose
light
malt
touch
taste
is
more
hoppy
than
floral
clean
malt
bill
though
taste
isnt
as
assertive
as
regular
duvel
mediumlight
mouthfeel
good
effervescence
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
but
my
preference
runs
toward
big
brother
duvel
imo
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
very
solid
belgian
pale
ale
could
easily
sit
and
drink
this
all
day
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
belgian
candy
sugar
and
a
pils
like
hop
in
the
taste
sweet
to
small
dry
fruitiness
and
a
note
of
a
pilsner
like
hop
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruitiness
to
clean
aftertaste
easy
and
nice
quite
pilsner
like
the
mustiness
of
belgian
yeast
hits
first
pear
coriander
and
a
touch
of
pepper
sit
behind
the
flavors
fall
nicely
into
a
body
thats
a
little
too
light
i
was
expecting
a
duvel
light
feel
but
this
a
different
beast
all
together
its
extremely
drinkable
and
a
nice
complement
to
the
frites
i
ordered
a
compared
to
regular
duvel
this
is
softer
milder
and
most
obviously
less
strong
i
need
to
try
a
headtohead
but
from
memory
i
may
actually
prefer
this
little
brother
to
the
big
devil
due
to
adverseto
me
effects
of
the
higher
abv
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
theres
not
enough
difference
between
the
2
beers
to
really
stand
out
o
i
coulld
drink
alot
of
this
great
rep
for
the
style
dr
its
a
touch
strawladen
for
my
tastes
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
its
just
nothing
special
a
good
introduction
to
belgian
styles
for
someone
not
so
familiar
taste
is
full
of
belgian
yeast
banana
is
the
featured
flavor
here
with
accents
of
clove
the
yeast
fullflavored
yet
not
chewy
and
overdone
well
dont
duvel
i
feel
it
at
the
back
of
my
mouth
sits
very
light
and
feels
clean
it
feels
like
a
euro
lager
all
the
flavors
are
there
but
when
you
finish
you
drink
all
the
flavors
fade
insanely
quickly
it
makes
you
want
all
those
good
flavors
to
come
backmaking
you
drink
more
drinkability
at
its
finest
taste
is
of
tropical
fruit
and
subtle
belgian
malts
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
that
blows
me
away
but
an
ok
beer
i
would
never
order
this
for
myself
but
i
know
alot
of
people
who
like
it
on
tap
at
the
old
monk
in
dallas
has
a
huge
resilient
white
head
that
slowly
breaks
into
large
chunks
clear
gold
in
color
smells
malty
yeasty
spicy
and
phenolic
bubblegum
notes
come
through
upon
a
second
take
tastes
of
apricot
and
apples
with
an
afterthought
of
malt
dry
and
light
to
medium
bodied
feels
empty
comparatively
speaking
like
it
needs
something
else
involved
but
i
cant
quite
put
a
finger
on
it
needs
some
balls
but
perhaps
theres
a
niche
market
for
those
looking
for
lighter
simpler
experience
im
not
going
to
be
in
that
camp
went
to
the
boston
belgian
beer
fest
this
afternoon
i
rushed
to
the
duvel
stand
i
wanted
to
taste
the
duvel
green
i
had
heard
so
much
about
well
there
it
was
under
another
name
duvel
single
they
changed
the
name
as
green
implied
being
green
saving
the
planet
kind
of
thing
or
being
of
a
green
colour
and
there
was
a
lot
of
resistance
from
people
so
they
told
me
anyhow
i
tasted
the
duvel
single
and
it
is
all
that
i
expected
its
a
duvel
in
a
smaller
package
less
alcoholic
more
refreshing
like
a
everynight
after
work
kind
of
beer
i
truly
enjoyed
it
a
nice
alternative
to
a
leffe
or
a
stella
which
i
tend
to
get
a
bit
bored
with
at
times
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
id
definitely
give
it
another
try
overall
to
me
this
beer
strips
away
what
duvel
is
lacking
the
huge
dryness
and
yeast
character
this
is
simply
a
step
down
my
guess
is
that
this
was
created
in
order
to
appeal
to
more
of
the
mainstream
market
having
this
on
tap
is
a
ruse
to
trip
up
newcomers
to
the
craft
beer
scene
order
the
regular
duvel
overall
really
nice
for
my
palate
better
than
the
regular
but
im
sure
thats
the
minority
opinion
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
golden
in
color
with
12
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
offering
hints
of
malt
belgian
yeast
and
bread
decent
flavor
though
i
much
prefer
the
standard
version
of
duvel
this
version
of
duvel
is
much
lighter
in
seemingly
all
facets
appearance
aroma
flavor
and
body
that
said
its
a
nice
light
crisp
refreshing
beer
drinkability
is
high
i
would
have
this
again
nice
drink
not
as
complex
as
original
but
had
a
quality
for
summer
drinking
clean
and
refreshing
lacks
the
personality
of
the
standard
duvel
but
like
its
big
brother
this
one
drinks
much
lighter
than
the
abv
would
indicate
very
nice
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
biscuit
malt
with
a
lot
of
spices
and
some
grassy
hops
the
beer
smells
much
hoppier
than
regular
duvel
the
flavor
is
also
quite
hoppy
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
get
some
yeast
as
well
as
some
spicy
european
hops
which
compliment
the
bready
malt
very
well
the
alcohol
is
more
well
hidden
than
in
regular
duvel
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
keep
wanting
to
read
both
elements
of
well
made
pilsners
and
the
original
duvel
beer
in
the
same
glass
as
if
they
were
blended
but
this
beer
borrows
whats
best
of
both
styles
and
brands
and
allows
for
a
remarkably
sessionable
beer
d
great
drink
out
of
the
tap
i
really
like
duvel
from
the
tap
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
is
a
medium
bodies
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
well
done
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
but
creeps
out
with
greater
presence
as
the
brew
warms
and
seems
slightly
more
than
the
listed
7
it
maintains
a
pleasant
warmth
down
the
back
of
my
throat
and
was
a
perfect
pairing
for
my
meal
this
brew
did
not
offer
a
drastic
change
from
the
standard
duvel
offering
if
anything
it
is
lighter
and
a
bit
more
approachable
well
done
it
has
the
typical
duvel
color
but
not
the
characteristic
halftheglasshead
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
but
its
still
decent
aroma
is
also
decent
but
not
particularly
amazing
good
overall
flavor
profile
but
not
enormously
complex
good
belgian
style
balance
of
malts
and
hops
smooth
and
a
bit
bubbly
on
the
tongue
overall
a
decent
choice
but
id
rather
go
with
the
original
o
i
may
has
skew
towards
rating
this
higher
just
because
i
love
duvel
and
this
brew
does
duvel
justice
drinking
this
finally
makes
me
angry
with
myself
for
not
buying
duvel
triple
hop
when
it
was
extremely
fresh
this
beer
has
convinced
me
that
even
the
slightest
variance
on
the
basic
duvel
is
worth
experiencing
duvel
green
tastes
like
a
82
ratio
of
duvel
to
water
in
other
words
a
slightly
subdued
version
of
duvel
still
carried
the
nice
amount
of
belgian
yeast
and
lemon
rind
overall
big
notable
aspect
to
me
was
the
tempering
of
alcoholic
burn
compared
to
the
regular
still
equally
as
crisp
and
clean
good
draft
beer
to
rely
on
just
a
little
muted
in
the
flavor
area
served
in
a
proper
25cl
duvel
snifter
a
big
white
head
that
is
gone
almost
instantly
sticky
lacing
a
lovely
nose
of
coriander
and
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
subtle
with
some
moderate
spicyness
prickly
hops
and
a
barely
there
malt
profile
a
dry
finish
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
won
another
free
drink
this
is
going
well
o
overall
a
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
duvel
beer
but
worth
checking
out
i
enjoyed
the
citrus
and
bananas
in
the
taste
and
wish
they
had
come
through
mroe
in
the
nose
worth
trying
but
next
time
i
would
just
order
the
regular
duvel
in
all
although
i
still
hold
a
stronger
place
for
the
original
duvel
in
my
heart
having
finally
had
a
taste
of
this
brew
made
my
day
i
didnt
really
care
about
the
score
will
give
it
another
try
when
back
in
ny
or
whenever
i
get
to
land
this
beer
just
as
randomly
in
the
future
poured
strawyellow
with
a
large
white
head
that
lingered
throughout
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
and
grass
taste
started
out
similar
to
a
witbier
almost
with
the
citrus
hops
and
mild
spice
but
shifted
into
belgian
yeast
and
the
funk
and
grassiness
that
was
in
the
nose
light
and
finishes
off
crisp
with
a
semifunky
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
a
delicious
easy
drinking
light
belgian
pale
ale
a
proper
little
brother
to
the
bottled
version
of
duvel
very
good
o
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
who
wants
a
lighter
version
of
original
jd
d
very
drinkable
wouldnt
order
another
one
if
they
had
a
decent
selection
but
if
im
stuck
somewhere
with
limited
selection
and
this
is
on
tap
im
a
happy
guy
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
it
really
just
pales
in
comparison
to
the
ambrosia
that
is
bottled
duvel
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
if
i
had
a
choice
i
would
pick
the
bottled
version
every
time
d
a
good
beer
but
normal
bottled
duvel
is
still
much
better
not
recommended
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
had
this
on
tap
at
coles
in
buffalo
saw
duvel
green
on
their
board
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
it
was
seems
it
is
this
beer
pours
a
pale
goldenyellow
colour
with
a
finger
of
white
head
really
nice
head
retention
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
more
hops
than
a
typical
duvel
i
think
it
worked
nicely
for
this
spicy
belgian
yeast
in
the
aroma
as
well
some
bitterness
dry
flavour
really
nice
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
lighter
belgianstyle
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
belgian
pale
ale
its
certainly
worth
a
try
and
i
think
i
might
prefer
this
one
over
the
normal
duvel
give
it
a
try
cheers
not
as
dry
as
the
traditional
duvel
but
has
great
belgian
flavors
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
pretty
refreshing
and
smooth
drinking
definitely
a
nice
change
from
the
traditional
duvel
offering
a
lighter
version
of
the
classic
duvel
but
just
not
worth
the
extra
cost
10

glad
to
have
tried
it
once
d
i
think
i
like
the
regular
better
but
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
went
down
easy
and
quick
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
if
the
mood
for
it

color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
that
left
a
solid
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
great
with
a
grassy
floral
smell
some
lemon
zest
spice
yeast
is
there
as
well
taste
is
what
i
expected
from
the
smell
really
refreshing
and
crisp
with
some
citrus
hay
and
spice
yeast
definitely
a
lighter
feel
than
standard
duvel
the
drinkability
on
this
was
high
and
a
great
beer
to
start
the
night
with
d
not
as
impressive
as
duvel
or
the
exemplary
triple
hop
but
as
a
stand
alone
belgian
its
quite
nice
for
me
really
a
light
version
of
triple
hop
very
american
oriented
so
if
you
like
the
hoppy
american
brews
this
is
a
beer
you
need
to
try
this
beer
appears
pale
with
at
least
2
maybe
more
fingers
of
bone
foam
the
smell
the
smell
is
lots
of
lemon
curd
some
grassy
notes
and
a
wheat
malt
aroma
to
me
it
smells
like
a
sweet
pilsner
the
flavor
is
just
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
had
dictated
the
flavors
are
similar
to
malted
sugar
and
lemon
meringue
pie
the
odd
part
about
the
flavor
is
the
odd
perhaps
off
putting
aftertaste
the
flavor
i
found
to
best
equate
it
was
steamed
carrots
which
i
like
for
dinner
but
not
in
my
beer
but
it
is
still
a
fairly
good
drinking
brew
but
it
just
has
an
odd
component
that
i
found
it
hard
to
get
past
to
say
its
anything
special
its
about
time
i
had
this
it
pours
a
clear
saffrondandelion
topped
by
over
two
fingers
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
flowers
grass
wet
hay
and
a
rather
light
vein
of
lemon
peel
it
all
combines
into
quite
the
olfactory
blast
the
taste
holds
notes
of
earthy
hops
pepper
clove
banana
orange
peel
and
lemongrass
its
all
kinda
onesided
even
if
its
enjoyable
the
body
is
a
medium
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
dont
think
i
could
really
drink
all
that
much
so
much
belgianness
despite
the
different
categorization
on
style
i
would
be
hard
pressed
not
to
compare
duvel
draft
to
the
bottled
version
while
the
original
has
a
more
impressive
appearance
and
a
snappier
mouthfeel
the
draft
version
definitely
holds
it
own
a
nice
lighter
spin
on
the
original
duvel
lite
yes
please
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
brings
grain
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
taste
is
light
fruits
lemon
grain
citrus
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
hops
good
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
levels
drinks
really
well
and
is
a
nice
spin
on
a
classic
the
mouth
is
sharp
with
good
carbonation
laid
over
a
medium
body
beer
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
could
be
paired
with
cheeses
a
good
salad
and
definitely
some
mussels
or
shellfish
duvel
green
or
duvel
draft
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
went
great
with
the
hot
weather
its
basically
duvel
except
lighter
in
every
way
the
appearance
is
a
lighter
shade
of
gold
and
very
clear
the
huge
whipped
eggwhites
head
on
duvel
isnt
as
thick
or
long
lasting
on
this
one
still
it
left
extremely
impressive
thick
rings
of
sticky
lacing
after
each
sip
the
nose
isnt
as
strong
or
complex
as
duvel
and
neither
is
the
flavor
there
are
a
lot
less
spice
and
yeast
flavors
the
body
is
closer
to
the
light
side
of
medium
rather
than
full
and
thick
like
duvel
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
light
beer
and
for
what
it
is
it
deserves
a
good
score
i
would
probably
choose
the
fully
fermented
regular
duvel
given
the
choice
again
though
d
no
problems
downing
my
glass
on
this
one
no
where
near
the
original
in
complexity
but
still
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
so
tasty
and
very
well
drinking
its
a
fantastic
version
of
duvel
available
on
draft
apparently
in
extremely
limited
quantities
decent
brew
easy
drinking
not
a
real
alcoholic
punch
in
this
one
i
dug
it
but
would
go
with
the
traditional
duvel
if
i
had
to
choose
overall
duvel
remains
a
top
notch
beer
but
duvel
draft
is
mediocre
at
best
d
as
superdrinkable
as
regular
duvel
but
a
full
1
less
abv
this
devil
just
got
more
sinister
however
something
is
lost
without
that
fermentation
so
while
still
extremely
tasty
it
pales
just
a
bit
next
to
its
heartier
sibling
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
find
it
on
someones
taplist
pours
a
hazed
golden
yellow
with
full
frothy
white
head
leaving
good
amounts
behind
and
lacing
scent
is
of
grass
hay
fresh
white
bread
and
the
faintest
kiss
of
lemon
taste
is
again
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
dried
hay
the
yeasts
are
minimal
and
give
the
taste
of
fresh
white
bread
the
hops
give
the
faintest
touch
akin
to
lemongrass
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
active
carbonation
slick
and
silky
a
pretty
good
all
around
belgian
pale
d
big
fan
of
duvel
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
since
i
found
out
it
existed
left
a
little
disappointed
it
was
certainly
drinkable
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
other
belgians
on
tap
but
i
wanted
to
move
onto
something
more
substantial
the
reason
why
beer
is
popular
so
phenomenal
that
my
girlfriend
likes
it
a
nice
deep
amberyellow
with
a
slight
foamy
head
excellent
complex
smell
that
provokes
emotions
it
shouldnt
with
a
simple
beverage
and
the
taste
oh
the
taste
complex
subtle
not
too
strong
of
an
alcohol
flavor
yet
distinctly
belgian
with
moderate
hop
character
lovely
smooth
flavor
delicate
yet
complex
very
refreshing
even
when
the
acs
too
strong
fantastic
beverage
thank
you
belgiam
pours
a
great
clear
gold
color
with
a
big
fluffyrocky
white
head
head
eventually
comes
down
but
still
has
great
retention
aroma
of
fruits
and
yeast
some
apples
pears
and
bread
the
taste
starts
off
with
yeast
then
some
spicy
malts
and
bread
come
in
followed
by
the
apple
and
pear
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
yeasty
light
to
mediumbodied
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
the
regular
duvel
hope
i
can
continue
to
find
it
on
tap
d
honestly
i
could
sit
out
on
that
porch
at
iron
abbey
and
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
the
atmosphere
of
a
warm
summer
night
and
this
beer
complement
each
other
well
d
very
crisp
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
d
i
wouldnt
pay
for
this
one
again
even
if
it
was
reasonably
priced
it
would
be
overpriced
sorry
moortgat
the
duvel
draft
was
unimpressive
and
yet
very
expensive
thats
a
bad
combination
price
9

duvel
green
is
like
80
duvel
but
80
of
the
worldfamous
duvel
is
still
damn
good
in
fact
i
might
take
this
over
the
original
on
a
particularly
hot
afternoon
on
tap
at
pangaea
in
sacramento
poured
into
a
25
l
duvel
green
tulip
huge
familiar
fluffy
white
lacy
head
2
inches
tall
rests
atop
a
golden
body
and
leaves
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
zesty
lemony
citrus
and
a
slight
touch
of
belgian
sour
yeast
taste
is
biscuity
slightly
bitter
and
even
a
bit
pilsnerish
very
easy
to
drink
which
is
no
surprise
whatsoever
considering
how
well
the
abv
is
hidden
on
the
regular
duvel
i
aint
mad
at
em
pours
the
typical
golden
duvel
color
with
some
big
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
though
not
quite
as
strong
as
regular
duvel
smell
is
faint
yeastiness
a
bit
of
clove
and
some
grassy
hoppiness
taste
follows
exactly
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
strikes
me
as
a
belgian
ipa
honestly
and
i
really
like
it
my
only
complaint
here
is
on
the
feel
its
very
thin
imo
this
doesnt
have
the
fullness
of
classic
duvel
great
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
to
start
my
day
drank
this
at
330
a
m
at
a
belgian
bar
i
stumbled
upon
while
wandering
around
nyc
easy
5
for
appearance
this
or
the
regular
duvel
in
the
duvel
tulip
doesnt
get
much
better
hazy
golden
with
massive
fluffy
white
head
looks
excellent
the
whole
time
like
a
beer
bath
with
way
too
much
bubble
bath
mix
spice
and
light
fruits
in
the
scent
taste
is
yeast
spice
pear
grass
carbonation
and
alcohol
taste
toned
down
very
much
from
the
regular
i
like
nice
dry
bitterness
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
liked
it
better
than
the
regular
duvel
i
just
wish
it
was
cheaper
paid
8
for
a
glass
ive
never
seen
it
less
than
7
the
mouth
feel
is
spot
on
with
a
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
light
body
devilishly
drinkable
notes
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
its
bigger
brother
but
i
can
enjoy
one
now
and
then
and
understand
rather
well
its
status
and
the
complexities
it
offers
this
feels
like
an
unremarkable
watered
down
version
im
sure
it
can
probably
feel
wonderful
as
a
light
belgium
option
under
hot
weather
had
as
duvel
green
label
pours
a
transparent
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
rich
malty
yeasty
slightly
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
aroma
is
quite
appetizing
lively
flavor
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
citrus
undertone
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
smooth
fizzy
texture
leaves
a
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
finish
the
carbonation
is
really
dominant
in
the
palate
of
this
beer
a
lot
there
is
almost
a
citrusy
brightness
to
this
beer
tastes
almost
like
a
tripel
in
flavor
good
yeast
character
drinkability
high
and
mouthfeel
is
good
i
think
theres
a
little
too
much
carbonation
in
the
mouth
otherwise
its
good
not
as
good
as
duvel
in
my
opinion
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
overall
a
good
draft
selection
when
there
isnt
much
else
but
this
is
a
few
notches
below
their
flagship
bottled
product
on
tap
at
515
in
santa
cruz
poured
into
a
duvel
green
tulip
a
nice
touch
for
sure
clear
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
very
grassy
and
lemony
with
spicy
phenolic
notes
and
a
light
esteriness
flavors
of
noble
hops
and
light
pear
and
banana
with
a
mild
tart
citric
character
finishes
dry
and
clean
like
its
big
sister
i
dig
it
on
tap
as
duvel
green
at
eulogy
belgian
tavern
in
philly
served
in
a
duvel
green
tulip
the
beer
was
clear
gold
with
a
tall
fluffy
white
head
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
this
one
really
blew
me
away
it
seemed
to
share
little
in
common
with
the
original
duvel
instead
of
the
soft
vanilla
candy
and
clove
notes
this
was
hoppy
with
almost
sour
lemon
rind
and
big
for
a
belgian
grassy
hops
that
was
wonderfully
balanced
against
mild
biscuit
and
bread
crust
malt
flavors
that
ran
under
the
yeast
and
hop
character
heck
of
a
beer
find
it
and
drink
several
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
clear
golden
ale
has
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
with
real
nice
lacing
as
you
drink
it
this
is
a
session
beer
for
me
and
ive
gotten
a
lot
of
the
budmillercoors
crowd
who
shy
away
from
most
things
not
macro
to
drink
this
and
want
more
it
seemed
to
have
less
carbination
than
regular
duvel
and
has
hints
of
apple
in
it
i
likely
wont
be
tryign
this
again
as
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beverage
musty
earthy
slightly
fruity
aromamakes
me
wanna
mow
some
lawn
taste
is
a
similar
grass
cutting
inspiration
sweet
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
floral
stickiness
mouthfeel
lacked
the
duvel
delicateness
and
came
across
more
as
mineral
water
mouthfeel
felt
thinner
that
the
regular
duvel
and
the
flavor
was
less
intense
drinkability
is
alright
but
the
alcohol
and
spice
notes
get
a
little
aggressive
as
it
warms
duvel
draft
is
pretty
drinkable
but
the
places
where
i
encounter
it
seem
to
attach
a
hefty
price
tag
to
it
8
bucks
a
tulip
which
is
a
drawback
i
figured
duvel
draft
would
be
lighter
but
not
taste
so
much
different
this
is
closer
to
an
orval
than
an
original
duvel
but
im
not
complaining
certainly
worth
a
try
but
only
if
youve
had
original
duvel
first
drinkability
simply
a
lighter
version
of
the
classic
duvel
in
all
aspects
from
the
flavor
to
the
body
to
the
alcohol
to
even
the
smallsized
glassware
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
really
sometimes
a
whopper
jr
instead
of
a
whopper
will
do
just
fine
d
probably
very
high
if
i
were
into
this
beer
given
how
light
it
is
but
i
can
barely
see
myself
finishing
this
glass
i
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
it
was
served
in
a
duvel
green
tulip
it
is
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
very
sticky
3
finger
white
head
the
only
scent
i
could
detect
was
some
spiciness
cloves
the
flavor
was
thin
and
disapointing
my
wife
thought
it
tasted
like
miller
lite
there
were
hints
of
spiciness
but
honestly
it
was
bland
it
is
light
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
i
would
avoid
this
one
imo
it
is
an
overated
brew
i
suspect
that
duvel
green
shines
when
you
pair
it
with
good
deepflavored
food
i
stopped
in
at
bxl
on
my
way
to
grand
central
for
a
couple
afternoon
beers
and
duvel
greens
flavor
just
isnt
big
or
good
enough
to
serve
that
purpose
for
me
anyway
just
had
this
today
on
tap
at
the
brewhouse
in
santa
barbara
man
it
was
wonderful
i
had
never
had
it
before
and
didnt
notice
in
any
reviews
of
it
the
fact
that
it
has
a
noticeable
brett
character
but
the
one
i
had
did
and
its
awesome
has
most
of
the
qualities
i
love
about
duvel
the
crisp
pilsner
malt
character
the
lightdryness
fresh
crispness
appley
qualities
and
nice
big
foamy
mousse
but
with
the
addition
of
the
funky
brett
character
that
put
it
over
the
top
totally
awesome
like
a
farmhouse
duvel
i
will
drink
1
or
2
on
tap
each
time
i
go
there
until
its
gone
wonderful
beer
d
i
made
it
through
this
one
pretty
quickly
i
was
told
it
was
an
attempt
by
duvel
to
make
a
begginer
belgian
which
is
not
quite
as
strong
as
their
traditional
brew
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
subtle
belgium
style
beer
which
doesnt
overpower
but
still
provides
those
classic
belgian
flavours
drinkability
soso
the
taste
of
this
ale
is
so
unlike
anything
else
ive
ever
tasted
that
i
didnt
even
finish
it
with
that
said
if
you
find
this
extremely
limited
beer
on
tap
at
your
swilling
establishment
give
it
a
shot
its
unlike
anything
youve
ever
had
d
ver
good
but
its
no
regular
duvel
i
tried
this
ontap
at
the
bxl
beglian
cafe
in
midtown
manhattan
maybe
not
a
pale
ale
per
se
but
rather
a
belgian
hefeblonde
eagerly
anticipated
on
draught
at
our
local
independent
my
wife
i
sampled
it
during
the
fluff
festival
underwhelming
i
expected
so
much
for
a
relatively
rare
anticipated
beer
especially
from
duvel
perhaps
this
is
an
attempt
to
win
over
the
summerhefe
beer
crowd
who
like
lemon
wedges
dancing
ponies
the
pour
was
a
bright
yellow
with
full
white
fluffy
head
that
left
some
good
lace
with
an
aroma
of
crackery
yeast
lemonpepper
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
hefeblond
mix
not
horrible
if
thats
what
you
expect
but
simplistic
i
thought
yeasty
with
some
spice
lemon
the
drinkability
was
good
nice
smooth
crisp
definitely
better
for
a
nice
summer
day
rather
than
fall
evening
all
in
all
id
rather
save
a
couple
bucks
have
an
allagash
white
on
tap
at
redbones
in
somerville
for
6
50
served
in
the
proper
glass
huge
fluffy
white
head
to
start
two
things
i
notice
different
from
regular
duvel
first
is
the
much
lighter
yellow
color
of
the
body
and
second
is
that
it
does
not
seem
to
be
as
carbonated
smell
was
yeasty
and
spicy
tasted
like
a
normal
duvel
also
crisp
and
sharp
on
the
palate
too
the
abv
is
a
bit
lower
which
is
what
the
brewery
was
presumably
going
for
it
is
actually
noticeable
which
not
a
bad
thing
if
they
are
trying
to
make
an
even
smoothertodrink
duvel
they
have
succeeded
it
went
well
with
a
plate
of
bbq
food
f
finishes
slightly
dry
and
almost
disappears
from
the
palate
completely
a
light
banana
taste
seems
to
poke
it
head
out
at
the
finish
as
well
and
a
touch
more
belgian
yeast
to
finish
it
off
very
good
lacing
on
this
one
light
golden
citrus
grains
hops
and
spices
in
the
nose
belgian
spice
and
yeast
dominant
in
the
taste
grains
and
hops
are
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
pretty
much
a
lighter
version
of
duvel
hopefully
i
can
find
this
one
in
bottle
form
in
the
future
for
when
im
going
belgian
crazy
d
very
fresh
and
flavorful
belgian
blonde
in
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
excellent
job
duvel
d
good
in
hot
weather
or
when
out
in
the
sun
i
would
like
to
try
this
next
to
the
standard
duvel
to
really
note
the
difference
d
not
quite
as
interesting
as
regular
duvel
but
easier
to
put
down
give
it
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
taken
on
its
own
merits
it
was
a
pleasant
blondepale
drink
of
beer
but
knowing
its
big
brother
so
well
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
in
the
body
and
mouthfeel
would
i
have
another
yes
why
bother
its
worth
trying
but
the
far
more
widely
available
variety
is
significantly
better
just
disappointing
all
around
still
its
nice
and
quite
drinkable
on
tap
at
sierra
grill
for
the
duvel
green
release
i
wanna
take
the
glass
home
poured
a
great
lime
greenyellow
with
a
12
finger
head
in
the
signature
glass
great
belgian
lacing
is
left
behind
and
the
head
retains
well
for
a
pale
smell
is
kind
of
weak
cant
pick
up
much
belg
yeast
spices
a
bit
of
citrus
and
malts
taste
is
better
than
smell
same
elements
but
better
balance
great
citrus
in
here
along
with
a
solid
belgian
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
with
great
carb
substance
and
a
great
belgian
aftertaste
coat
no
alcohol
taste
for
me
extremely
refreshing
7
makes
no
appearance
hopefully
i
can
enjoy
this
one
again
d
i
prefer
the
regular
duvel
to
this
one
considering
the
cost
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
d
a
great
draft
version
of
the
duvel
all
the
hops
yeast
w
a
lighter
feel
and
more
quaffable
effect
very
smooth
and
worthy
of
praise
a
great
representation
of
the
style
d
extremely
drinkable
and
particularly
appropriate
for
warm
weather
this
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
almost
thirst
quenching
highly
recommended
no
matter
how
many
beers
a
bar
might
have
if
they
have
the
duvel
green
im
gonna
order
one
as
amazing
as
the
original
but
lower
enough
in
alcohol
that
you
can
drink
it
a
lot
easier
and
there
is
no
alcohol
aroma
or
bite
to
interfear
with
the
pure
pleasure
of
this
beer
get
it
anywhere
any
time
yeah
it
is
a
little
green
and
lacks
the
complexity
of
its
big
brother
i
cant
say
that
im
that
impressed
with
it
but
it
has
made
me
appreciate
how
a
few
extra
steps
can
take
a
relatively
ordinary
beer
and
make
it
into
a
world
classic
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
good
beer
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
a
normal
duvel
this
beer
tastes
a
duvel
robbed
of
much
of
its
complexity
and
depth
of
character
its
a
light
refreshing
version
of
duvel
that
i
enjoyed
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
the
wide
distribution
and
relatively
cheap
price
of
duvel
are
pretty
incredible
for
such
a
world
class
beer
i
appreciate
the
brewerys
attempt
to
make
a
light
version
but
the
magic
of
the
original
just
isnt
there
for
me
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
malty
theres
a
grassy
note
to
it
the
flavor
is
bright
and
adds
in
some
apple
cider
flavor
and
light
belgian
spicing
mouthfeel
is
lively
drinkability
is
good
a
milder
version
of
a
duvel
in
the
sense
that
its
a
plain
solid
bpa
very
nice
crisp
pine
hop
with
that
green
grassy
quality
a
very
well
formed
head
of
the
brewerys
form
a
very
consistent
and
text
book
beligan
style
pale
ale
crisp
hop
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
clean
bitter
finish
that
seems
to
have
a
mild
mint
quality
to
it
formulaic
not
particularly
unique
however
those
are
where
the
simalarities
end
the
taste
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
what
a
duvel
light
tastes
like
even
though
the
abv
is
only
off
by
2
the
taste
to
seems
considerably
more
there
was
also
no
carbonation
activity
present
after
the
pour
something
that
duvel
is
known
for
as
a
stand
alone
beer
this
would
be
a
good
offering
but
i
am
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
this
is
under
the
duvel
name
and
because
of
that
i
automatically
assume
some
stuff
about
the
beer
it
is
an
unfair
comparison
but
it
happens
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
i
want
a
duvel
ill
just
reach
for
the
original
notes
an
all
time
classic
on
tap
who
could
ask
for
more
it
poured
nearly
identical
to
any
duvel
ive
had
before
gorgeous
golden
blonde
with
a
towering
white
head
however
it
left
much
less
lacing
and
dissolved
much
more
quickly
than
the
normal
duvel
bubbles
drift
upwards
rapidly
from
the
apex
of
the
tulip
the
smell
was
a
bit
different
from
the
regular
duvel
it
had
a
bit
more
hop
presence
and
more
fruitiness
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
such
as
heylissem
or
grimbergen
than
the
pilsener
bite
of
duvel
also
the
nose
was
indeed
a
touch
weaker
than
expected
very
similar
to
the
smell
came
the
taste
flavorful
but
not
overly
so
i
didnt
think
much
of
it
actually
light
and
refreshing
with
very
crisp
carbonation
dancing
on
the
palate
not
very
outstanding
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
10oz
pour
into
the
appropriate
glass
at
flying
saucer
served
a
surprisingly
crisp
gold
with
a
massive
head
that
slowly
diminished
to
a
clump
of
froth
but
left
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
a
nice
amount
of
crisp
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
somewhat
like
a
duvel
light
but
the
lingering
finish
comes
through
nicely
and
leaves
a
great
balance
of
sweet
malts
citrus
hops
and
mild
spice
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
refreshing
much
more
drinkable
in
the
summer
than
its
bottled
brother
this
is
just
about
as
special
as
the
bottled
version
very
enjoyable
aroma
was
slightly
peppery
and
phenolic
but
less
so
than
its
bottled
counterpart
some
grain
and
light
fruit
but
nothing
especially
well
defined
first
sips
had
a
crisp
feel
with
sharp
carbonation
dry
in
the
finish
with
some
very
light
hop
element
and
phenolicclove
traces
flavor
seemed
less
developed
than
bottleconditioned
duvel
also
no
big
fruit
just
a
slight
banana
taste
from
the
yeast
it
was
refreshing
but
for
the
price
id
go
with
something
different
next
i
dont
think
this
would
replace
duvels
spot
in
my
book
but
could
certainly
be
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
and
i
would
like
to
see
how
these
flavors
offset
some
richer
food
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
worth
checking
out
for
sure
d
the
subtlety
this
one
has
makes
it
go
down
really
easy
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
this
certainly
is
a
lite
version
of
the
bottle
conditioned
ale
but
it
still
is
well
worth
a
shot
was
at
ginger
man
in
ny
where
they
have
duvel
on
tap
my
gf
who
doesnt
like
beer
normally
but
likes
duvel
ordered
a
duvel
he
asked
green
or
bottle
huh
he
said
he
doesnt
recommend
green
so
she
got
the
bottle
can
never
go
wrong
with
duvel
anyway
later
he
brought
a
sample
of
duvel
green
to
taste
and
i
know
i
had
an
ipa
on
my
mouth
and
she
a
duvel
on
hers
but
my
only
impression
of
green
was
well
unremarkable
you
expect
duvel
and
get
eh
want
a
light
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
crap
this
is
for
you
drinkability
this
would
be
a
perfect
summer
beer
refreshing
and
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
while
it
seems
less
complex
than
the
bottled
duvel
that
would
make
it
better
for
drinking
on
a
social
occasion
over
a
meal
or
at
a
party
it
would
be
very
easy
to
finish
off
several
of
these
drinkability
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
brisk
but
welcoming
belgian
pale
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
and
it
shouldnt
be
considered
for
anything
other
than
what
it
is
d
less
alcohol
as
well
but
this
is
not
to
far
off
from
the
bottled
version
just
with
a
different
body
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
though
and
i
am
glad
to
see
it
on
draft
i
just
wont
be
getting
it
that
much
very
close
to
a
belgian
pils
really
great
beer
overall
im
so
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
the
draft
version
of
my
absolute
favorite
beer
it
seems
like
a
more
sociable
accessible
duvel
which
is
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
the
bottled
duvel
is
something
you
sit
and
savor
basking
in
its
devilish
glory
this
is
one
you
can
drink
more
of
casually
amongst
good
company
either
way
both
are
still
excellent
brews
dvery
nice
a
flavourful
light
brew
i
found
this
to
be
like
a
belgian
pils
if
such
a
thing
existed
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
you
should
try
giving
the
chance
overall
a
great
session
style
beer
from
duvel
that
is
uber
drinkable
still
even
with
this
the
quality
is
top
notch
as
expected
in
duvel

a

a

from
the
sweeter

brews
i
associate
with
the
style
d
interesting
but
as
i
jotted
down
in
my
notebook
underwhelming
recommended
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
brew
ive
read
a
lot
of
people
becoming
annoyed
with
the
product
after
all
of
the
advertisement
however
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
definitely
a
different
brew
than
the
bottle
conditioned
duvel
and
deserves
praise
as
such
good
stuff
and
definitely
check
it

o
this
was

its

introduction
to
belgian

its
not
imposing
to
look
at
with
tons
of
sediment
nor
is
it
an
ugly
quad
it
doesnt
have
a
very
high

it
tastes
good
very
fruitforward
and
typical
of
the
esters
of
belgian
yeast
recommended
especially
if
you
have
never
had
a
belgian
ale
before
uma
boa
cerveja
ela
é
mais
leve
e
tranquila
dourada
e
de
sabor
e
aroma
moderados

possui
seu
equilíbrio

condescendência
com
a
proposta

notável

das

talvez
até
uma
das
melhores
nesse

not

bad
there
are
more

in
other

out
there
but
relatively
low

could
be
a
bonus
or
not
depending
on
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
light
overall
very
good
beer
body
and
mouth
feel
were
fine
and
this
is
a
fine

i
look

finding
it

somewhere
one

in

this
is
my
first
impression

i
would
leave
this
one
out
of
my
top
five
abby
style
beer
great
beer
but
it
is
in
a
tough
catagory
price
point
was
on
par
with
the
beer
though
a
good
value
by
comparison
to
other
belgian
trappist
style
beers
pours
a
copper
amber
with
a
large
lasting
beige
fluffy
head
with
good
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
bready
biscuit
malt
and
some
fruity
notes
taste
is
of
belgian
yeast
and
bread
some
slightly
zesty
fruit
flavors
with
some
mild
citrus
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
the
finish
is
belgian
yeast
and
bread
notes
mild
zesty
fruity
flavors
with
some
light
bitterness
a
good
belgian
blonde
ale
with
food
or
on
its
own
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
went
well
with
food
crepe
with
ham
and
cheese
had
a
second
one
and
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
the
first
definitely
more
hoppy
than
some
belgians
ive
had
recently
but
it
works
my
only
complaint
is
that
we
only
get
the
small
bottles
imported
to
rsa
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
pineapplelike
fruit
and
slight
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
and
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
special
about
this
one
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
a
solid
refreshing
brew
o
nice
and
well
balanced
beer
although
i
like
it
i
think
its
kinda
expensive
for
what
it
is
but
other
then
that
its
definitely
a
beer
i
could
drink
any
day
o
good
drinkability
actuallly
a
bit
disappointing
taste
which
is
too
watery
and
tasteless
to
the
stye
oa
decent
blonde
ale
with
pretty
good
body
and
flavor
jd
overall
hmm
there
are
better
samples
of
the
type
out
there
and
i
know
because
i
have
tried
some
a
light
dry
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
medium
bodied
affair
medium
body
though
it
leans
slightly
fuller
mediumlight
effervescence
drying
clean
finish
nice
brew
pours
a
goldenamber
color
into
my
goblet
with
a
very
clingy
overflowing
head
leaves
cotton
candy
like
residue
as
the
lacing
there
is
some
re
fermented
yeast
at
the
bottom
aroma
very
sweet
fruitiness
like
watermelon
and
pear
yeast
and
malt
character
is
going
to
be
dominant
going
by
the
aroma
as
well
taste
very
bready
with
wheat
banana
kiwi
melon
and
candy
apple
very
carbonated
and
medium
mouthfeel
a
fine
refreshing
brew
that
is
for
anyone
wondering
if
it
was
a
bad
bottle
doesnt
seem
consistent
with
other
reviews
from
the
caged
corked
750
ml
bottle
stamped
2012
910940
sampled
on
march
5
2012
the
cork
flies
across
the
room
and
a
nice
smokiness
erupts
from
the
bottle
it
pours
a
slight
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
small
longlasting
fizzy
white
head
on
the
nose
there
is
a
malted
bread
yeast
anise
and
thin
hop
character
the
body
is
a
bit
better
than
medium
up
front
the
taste
begins
with
sweet
malts
then
turns
over
to
a
peppery
character
and
ends
modestly
bitter
but
not
sour
this
is
a
decent
abbey
blonde
doa
overall
a
very
good
belgian
blonde
one
of
the
better
belgian
blondes
out
there
i
like
the
easy
drinking
nature
of
this
beer
and
it
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
one
of
the
best
belgian
blondes
ive
had
i
like
the
beer
but
my
expectations
of
a
trappist
were
much
greater
i
tried
the
maredsous
tripel
a
few
days
ago
and
it
was
also
equally
disappointing
sad
but
true
im
particularly
disappointed
with
this
one
because
hefeweizens
arent
difficult
to
make
and
for
a
trappist
i
expect
perfection
sadly
this
one
doesnt
even
come
close
330ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
poured
a
large
foamy
head
amber
colour
hazy
had
a
belgian
yeasty
aroma
typical
of
belgian
blondepale
ale
was
slightly
more
bitter
and
spicy
than
other
bpas
ive
had
tasted
notes
of
berries
normal
mouthfull
overall
a
beer
very
similar
to
leffegrimmbergen
blonde
that
is
pleasant
but
holds
no
major
surprise
overall
wife
says
not
my
favorite
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
hops
and
this
is
an
unusually
onenote
beer
husband
says
i
much
prefer
the
maredsous
8
overall
this
is
a
lessthanstellar
offering
its
nice
but
forgettable
id
probably
even
prefer
an
affligem
blonde
to
this
o
a
nice
one
from
maredsous
taste
an
appearance
stood
out
the
most
the
rest
was
pretty
much
what
i
had
expected
nice
quality
an
excellent
brew
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
seemingly
sessionable
final
thoughts
an
excellent
job
on
this
beer
i
must
say
this
is
a
case
that
the
brewer
knew
his
limitations
and
didnt
try
to
push
the
yeast
too
much
like
so
many
belgians
seem
to
do
with
me
crisp
clean
simple
but
not
boring
and
certainly
worth
a
try
easily
a
rival
for
even
the
trappist
brews
its
hard
to
find
a
lot
to
write
about
belgian
pale
ales
to
me
there
are
supposed
to
be
simple
yet
flavorful
and
refreshing
beers
that
provide
good
quality
without
having
to
flex
any
muscles
this
beer
successfully
nails
the
definition
of
such
ales
i
would
take
this
over
a
leffe
blond
ale
any
day
and
it
could
serve
as
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
who
are
just
starting
to
try
new
brews
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
decent
but
unexciting
belgian
pale
no
harm
in
drinking
it
but
there
is
much
better
out
there
taste
very
clean
and
crisp
but
still
has
a
soft
complex
fruitiness
peach
mineral
yeast
and
a
slight
tartness
on
the
end
overall
great
beer
maredsous
does
it
right
to
start
off
with
this
one
in
their
portfolio
great
pairing
for
some
triple
cream
cheese
honey
and
crackers
a
must
have
so
clean
for
a
belgian
and
yet
so
characterful
this
beer
is
crisp
refreshing
complex
and
incredibly
drinkable
pairs
with
any
number
of
foods
and
an
awesome
beer
to
have
around
highly
recommended
pale
blondeorangeish

one

some

sweet

off

here
poured
a
golden

with
some

white

just
offwhite
good

and
retention
nose
is
interesting
lightly
sour
funky
and
almost
gueuze
like
in
some
senses
some
yeasty
qualities
taste
has
some
light
tartness
on
the
front

wheaty
and
some
barnyard
like
funkiness
light

with
some

notes
lightlycoloured

and
a
minimal
spice
note
medium
light
body
medium
high
carbonation
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
that
doesnt
impede
its
drinkability
nice
light
and
pleasant
a
fairly
satisfying
blond
o
that
is
something
to
forget
very
quickly
generally
being
the
least
heradled
of
the
maredsous
beers
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
not
necessarily
a
world
beater
but
definitely
something
highly
worthwhile
to
drink
o
a
very
solid
refreshing
pale
ale
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
certainly
cant
complain
about
this
one
i
would
actually
recommend
this
over
duvel
its
quite
reasonably
priced
in
my
area
as
well
so
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
fans
of
the
style
on
tap
at
burger
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
bright
fleshy
orange
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
aroma
has
a
prominent
booze
note
along
with
some
light
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
honeycaramel
sweetness
the
sweet
cakey
malt
note
comes
out
more
in
the
flavor
not
much
else
going
on
here
kind
of
a
simple
beer
theres
an
astringent
hard
watermineral
note
that
leaves
the
palate
unclean
this
slowly
overtakes
the
sweetness
and
about
halfway
through
the
glass
its
pretty
distracting
a
rather
unsatisfying
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
nothing
special
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
spices
beautiful
gold
color
w
a
two
finger
off
white
head
excellent
carbonation
and
lacing
somewhat
clear
but
cloudy
enough
to
not
see
through
yeast
malt
pineapple
other
fruit
in
the
nose
nice
smelling
but
id
like
it
to
be
stronger
very
smooth
tasting
w
fruit
nuts
malt
coming
out
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
w
the
malt
coming
through
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
best
in
its
style
tasty
but
maredsous
tripel
is
the
best
from
that
label
that
ive
had
overall
nice
blond
beer
not
too
sweet
thats
what
i
like
overall
all
in
all
m6
is
a
pretty
tasty
competent
blonde
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
smooth
refreshing
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
this
is
a
terrific
companion
to
virtually
any
meal
or
just
hanging
on
the
deck
on
a
summer
evening
clean
tasty
and
not
overpowering
in
any
element
t
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
drink
from
starttofinish
complex
sweet
notes
and
some
mild
malt
flavors
really
balance
this
beer
and
provide
a
unique
drink
that
i
would
have
overandover
again
great
stuff
got
this
on
tap
at
the
sharp
edge
in
canonsburg
pa
a
big
fan
of
maredsous
abbey
it
pours
well
with
about
an
inch
light
head
it
is
very
nice
on
a
90
degree
day
since
it
has
little
over
powering
hop
after
taste
it
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bit
of
floral
overtones
i
would
only
recommend
to
those
who
like
beers
like
wittekerke
and
desire
a
light
hop
overtones
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beglian
pale
ale
smell
has
a
little
mint
to
it
and
if
it
had
a
little
more
going
on
in
the
taste
it
could
be
better
but
solid
none
the
less
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
enjoyed
both
sipping
my
way
through
the
first
half
of
this
beer
and
then
pairing
it
with
the
food
i
had
chosen
for
lunch
a
cheese
fruit
and
walnut
tart
garnished
with
a
touch
of
greens
my
over
all
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
id
not
say
it
is
world
class
but
it
is
well
worth
a
try
and
it
shows
very
well
in
comparison
with
other
belgian
pale
ales
ive
tried
o
overall
this
is
an
okay
bpa
like
many
others
i
tried
this
night
there
are
much
better
representations
of
this
style
the
cpj
d
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
straightforward
and
classic
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
a
good
beer
for
when
you
want
something
mild
and
mild
tasting
very
good
beer
those
damn
monks
i
love
drinking
out
of
this
goblet
too
makes
the
whole
experience
more
authentic
this
is
an
exquisitely
crafted
pale
ale
and
will
definitely
pick
up
more
in
the
future
poured
from
champagne
bottle
into
goblet
at
slightly
over
refrigerator
temperature
pouts
yellow
with
a
good
head
which
thins
but
remains
for
some
time
the
aroma
is
of
malt
without
any
hop
or
spice
aroma
the
flavor
is
malty
without
being
cloying
with
an
unbalanced
generic
hop
flavor
the
hops
and
malt
coexist
together
but
dont
seem
to
make
a
whole
thats
really
too
bad
for
such
a
pretty
beer
the
unbalanced
flavors
and
appropriately
high
carbonation
make
this
beer
enjoyable
but
forgettable
pours

slightly
hazed
pale
golden
hue

bubbled
effervescent
texture
fine
even

light
biscuit

sweetness
with
a
touch
of
tropical

a
nice
welcoming

going
on

well
clean

the

first
with
a
backend
of
fruitiness
and
herbal
grassiness
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
white
pepper
from
the
yeast
used
but
overall
a
very
complex
low
alcohol
session
ale
from
maredsous
finishes
pretty
dry
with
yeast
spice
and
grassy
hops
nice
straight
forward
belgian
pale
ale
efferevescent
carbonation
dead
on
to
the
style
overall
experience
is
a
good
one
a
beer
i
would
definitely
come
back
to
but
for
3
50
a
pop
at
the
local
im
sure
sixers
of
american
craft
beers
will
be
my
go
to
still
dr
very
good
but
not
the
best
abbey
beer
available
certainly
worth
a
try
but
it
doesnt
come
cheaply
youll
enjoy
it
but
its
not
amazing
the
abv
isnt
as
well
hidden
as
it
could
be
but
it
does
result
in
a
pleasant
warming
effect
average
drinkability
not
my
favorite
belgian
ale
very
enjoyable
beer
im
more
of
a
hop
bomb
fan
but
i
respect
the
sheer
quality
of
this
beer
a
well
rounded
and
flavourful
offering
fitting
the
role
of
being
duvels
little
brother
nicely
harmony
is
struck
between
flavour
and
drinkability
with
a
relatively
low
abv
and
tasty
belgian
yeast
and
the
frutiness
it
imparts
this
leaves
me
looking
forward
to
their
brune
and
tripel
ive
got
sitting
in
my
fridge
drank
this
one
at
flying
saucer
in
houston
on
pint
night
beautiful
glass
great
beer
wish
i
would
of
had
a
steak
to
eat
with
this
beer
light
but
still
with
flavor
refreshing
and
almost
felt
like
it
cleansed
my
pallet
between
sips
good
caramel
look
smell
and
taste
pleasing
and
cannot
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
beers
that
maredsous
offers
the
foam
was
light
wheat
in
color
lacey
and
creamy
the
color
was
a
red
golden
honey
the
smell
was
a
light
brisk
pils
wheaty
and
hoppy
the
taste
light
brisky
heavy
wheat
with
a
hoppy
feel
and
a
light
fruity
undertone
mouthfeel
smooth
and
somewhat
heavy
drinkability
not
too
bad
good
session
quaffable
this
beer
not
as
harsh
with
the
spices
carbonation
as
i
would
have
expected
and
instead
the
malts
provide
a
mellow
vanilla
toasted
biscuit
profile
that
backs
a
gentle
floral
hopping
clean
finish
with
a
flash
of
ethanol
and
pepper
mouthfeel
is
neat
and
crisp
with
a
mediumthin
body
overall
this
is
a
tasty
albeit
simple
blonde
ale
worth
a
try
an
enjoyable
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
dark
goldan
orange
colour
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
tastes
of
sweet
candied
sugars
with
some
dark
fruit
lingering
in
the
finish
its
almost
a
little
too
sweet
though
drinks
down
pretty
good
overall
but
its
not
overally
great
not
terrible
either
though
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
orange
reddish
highlights
that
had
a
thin
head
and
left
a
little
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
had
nice
belgian
yeast
notes
with
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
and
slight
booze
the
taste
also
had
huge
sweet
malt
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
with
pruny
dark
fruit
brown
sugar
accents
the
brew
was
full
in
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
maltyyeasty
dark
fruity
and
sticky
finish
it
drank
quite
well
and
was
a
solid
brew
from
maredsous
they
havent
dissapointed
me
id
get
again
but
not
a
unique
beer
or
a
panty
dropper
i
drink
a
330ml
bottle
slight
smell
with
the
white
head
the
taste
begin
with
light
sweet
and
finish
with
a
little
bit
bitter
generally
speaking
this
is
a
cleanly
feeling
of
taste
beer
between
belgian
and
german
hefewisen
flavor
d
fairly
high
drinkability
not
an
amazing
bpa
but
ive
had
much
worse
i
could
have
a
few
no
problem
d
a
solid
bpa
but
a
bit
lacking
in
character
taste
is
solid
without
doing
anything
unusual
or
special
d
nice
flavor
and
pretty
light
for
a
belgian
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
to
blow
you
away
drinkability
in
most
abbey
style
ranges
the
enkel
is
overlooked
in
favour
of
the
stronger
dubbel
and
tripel
styles
but
its
fairly
simple
flavour
and
lower
strength
make
it
a
great
refreshing
drinking
beer
d
all
day
long
in
the
summer
while
i
prefer
darker
more
substantial
beers
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
creamy
nearly
fully
textured
up
front
the
beer
fades
quickly
into
a
thinning
somewhat
watery
feel
barely
into
the
mid
palate
leaving
a
large
portion
of
the
session
flat
but
after
that
the
beer
finishes
with
a
whispering
evaporative
feel
that
efforlessly
lifts
from
the
mouth
surfaces
and
making
it
easy
to
drink
d
its
an
ok
beer
but
with
lots
of
other
beers
in
the
same
style
and
price
range
ill
probably
not
be
returning
here
super
soon

beer
not

but
great
in
this
ridiculously
humid

it
is
a
solid
pale
ale
one
that
i
would
go
back
to
and
one
that
s
fairly
cheap
as
well
o
remember
it
as
better
on

otherwise
good
for
the
price
drinkability
a
run
of
the
mill
blonde
but
a
decent
session
beer
a
bit
tame
for
the
style
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability
it
is
a
blond
which
is
worth
to
try
o
okay
but
not
great
definitely
unique
notes
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
blonde
for
sure
with
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
this
thing
drinks
a
little
too
easily
for
being

it
would
be
quite
easy
to
go
through
2
bombers
of
this
one
d
this
is
a
very
nice

of

foamy

with
tons
of

lots
of

too
smells
yeasty
but
im
not
getting
too
much
else
the
taste
has
some
sweetness
to
it
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
pleasant
enough
but
certainly
not
my
favourite
from
the
style
nice
carbonation
level
drinkability
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
would
definitely
get
again
mighty
easy
drinking
particularly
when
consumed
in
a
relative
beer
wasteland
thailand
where
macrolagers
are
king
i
may
have
overrated
as
a
result
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
regardless
of
where
you
enjoy
it
d
this
was
very
thirst
quenching
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
belgian
thats
sweet
light
and
refreshing
the
taste
is
superb
its
crisp
pale
malts
balanced
with
some
citrus
hops
mixed
in
with
yeast
some
bananas
clove
and
rounded
out
with
sweet
caramel
this
is
a
classic
so
delicate
so
smooth
yet
it
is
just
full
of
flavor
as
it
warms
the
clove
and
yeast
just
add
to
the
taste
its
a
medium
mouth
full
but
full
flavored
i
can
drink
this
first
or
last
or
anytime
in
between
delicious
well
made
highly
recommended
i
was
really
pleasantly
surprised
by
maredsous

i
was
expecting
an
average
offering
but
instead
was
really
wowed
i
really
appreciate
the
attention
to
detail
with
this
one
it
doesnt
try
to
impress
with
a
high
abv
or
overly
intense
flavors
instead
it
excels
at
offering
the
most
accessible
but
complex
and
enjoyable
experience
i
could
imagine
from
a
belgian
pale
ale

ive
been
meaning
to
try
the

and
dubbel
also
reddishorange
with
a
goodsized
offwhite

which
fades
quickly
and
leaves
a
dotted

yeasty
and
phenolic
aroma
floats
out
of
the
snifter
making
itself

without

reveals
some
malts
and
mild
hops
with
some
vinegar

caramel
in

tastes

goes

in
with
an

and
given
its
distinct
belgian
characters
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
nor
would
i
reach
for
it
on
a
hot
summers
day
however
i
would
reach
for
this
beer
in
the
winter
not
as
a
winter
warmer
but
instead
as
a
beer
to
bring
alcoholenabled
warmth
to
your
chest
when
you
look
out
the
window
on
a
cold
winters
night
sit
too
close
to
the
fire
though
and
youll
feel
the
heat
nose
pretty
cool
that
reminds
dairy
it
is
very
soft
mouth
good
malty
and
quite
bubbly
the
finish
but
really
the
end
spicy
flavors
leaves
cilantro
and
a
little
acidity
a
very
pleasant
beer
tasting
and
moreover
has
a
great
balance
another
excellent
beer
from
brewery
duvel
moortgat
great
d
pretty
easy
as
youd
think
but
foamy
d
easy
drinking
here
quite
sessionable
a
very
pleasant
drink
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
solid
rendition
of
a
belgian
pale
certainly
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
away
but
pleasantly
flavourful
balanced
and
ideal
for
a
refreshing
drink
nice
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
a
malty
start
with
the
usual
belgian
characteristics
honey
sweet
candy
suger
bubblegum
malt
fruity
banana
tropical
and
floral
these
are
the
same
tones
as
found
in
the
aroma
which
does
have
a
tiny
bit
of
earthy
funkiness
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
at
a
medium
level
that
i
like
theres
low
bitterness
but
the
aftertaste
with
some
citric
peel
but
it
also
has
some
slight
cardboard
tones
but
not
enough
to
discredit
this
beer
very
floral
and
hoppy
smell
a
hint
of
lemon
and
pineapple
taste
is
a
slightly
honey
sweet
malt
with
strong
bitterness
i
find
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
nevertheless
a
nice
little
belgian
style
i
personally
dont
think
i
would
have
this
again
i
prefer
other
blond
belgians
like
duval
this
beer
just
goes
down
so
easily
its
not
the
most
complex
or
interesting
belgian
out
there
but
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
sheer
refreshment
and
drinkability
this
beer
would
be
an
ideal
summer
beer
or
something
to
drink
after
a
day
out
hiking
pours
into
a
maredsous
chalice
clear
gold
with
an
inch
of
sticky
white
foam
initially
but
hazes
up
with
the
last
few
drops
nose
is
floral
with
a
bare
hint
of
funk
and
some
tropical
fruit
sweet
lightly
bitter
flavour
ample
apple
and
and
again
tropical
fruitiness
finishes
with
a
yeasty
characteristic
belgian
flavour
and
bitter
orange
quite
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
on
this
with
a
moderate
carbonation
mostly
a
typical
belgian
blonde
but
with
a
bit
heavier
flavour
and
body
quite
nice
and
amply
drinkable
drinkability
while
its
not
my
favorite
its
still
a
perfectly
respectable
beer
perhaps
without
the
light
sourness
it
would
rate
much
higher
d
the
light
body
and
relatively
low
abv
make
this
beer
an
easy
drinker
the
flavor
has
a
nice
complexity
that
grows
as
it
warms
my
only
wish
would
be
for
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
a
solid
choice
has
a
thick
dry
carbonated
mouthfeel
almost
like
ginger
ale
very
dry
indeed
meh
i
wouldnt
bother
trying
this
again
dan
enjoyable
beer
of
simple
elegance
that
i
would
buy
again
d
a
very
good
beer
that
might
be
more
drinkable
than
the
double
or
tripel
it
has
almost
the
same
flavor
profile
as
their
other
beers
only
scaled
way
back
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
the
carbonation
level
keeps
it
from
being
a
session
beer
d
with
the
6
it
goes
ok
on
a
nice
warm
day
a
nice
one
to
drink
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
really
tasted
more
like
a
blonde
than
a
belgian
pale
i
actually
didnt
have
that
strong
a
belgian
character
it
was
however
a
very
good
and
refreshing
beer
with
good
malt
character
good
carbonation
and
decent
flavor
and
drinkability
i
must
say
it
s
not
my
favourite
from
maredsous
but
very
drinkable
in
all
i
think
however
that
in
all
it
s
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
it
makes
you
burp
quite
a
lot
i
like
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
more
d
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ale
highly
sessionable
im
not
saying
they
are
the
same
but
if
you
like
orval
you
should
try
this
easy
drinking
solid
belgian
pale
the
tatse
is
a
little
complex
with
sweet
start
and
bitter
finish
not
really
what
i
was
expecing
nothing
special
that
id
get
again
a
good
drinking
beer
with
some
kick
but
not
the
knock
down
power
of
its
big
brothers
d
this
brew
is
very
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
it
would
make
a
fine
session
brew
keeping
me
on
my
toes
with
the
inherent
fun
of
its
flavors
if
only
it
werent
quite
so
pricy
im
fairly
ignorant
about
belgian
beer
but
ive
been
experimenting
with
some
of
the
lower
strength
varieties
lately
i
tend
to
steer
clear
of
anything
over
about
7
5
and
i
have
to
say
i
really
liked
maredsous
blonde
i
poured
into
a
big
duvel
glass
the
colour
was
a
cloudy
amber
and
the
head
was
great
nice
and
thick
the
smell
was
rich
and
pleasant
and
similar
to
other
belgian
pales
yeasty
the
taste
was
dry
and
spicy
with
no
discernible
alcohol
and
it
went
down
very
easily
in
terms
of
taste
and
smell
its
a
first
cousin
of
orval
and
ill
definitely
be
having
it
again
maredsous

poured
a

with
a
large

and
excellent

the
smell
was
of
yeast

hops
the
taste
was
bready
sweet
some
citrus
notes
as
well
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
was
good
crisp
and
carbonated
drinkability
was
good
as
well
this
was
a
great
beer
reminded
me
of
orval
but
a
bit
sweeter
very
nice
ale
that
i
will
look
for
again
d
a
nice
blond
belgian
beer
that
is
very
affordable
in
sweden
the
alkohol
is
highly

both

a
mostly
clear

with

you
know
it
was

nice
belgian
but
it
was
very
plain
just
smooth
sweet
bready
and
light
caramel
with
a
hit
of
belgian
spice
you
really
expect
more
from
a
good
belgian
drinkable
but
for
6
i
want
a
better
beer
drinkability
is
good
really
liked
the
aroma
and
was
slightly
let
down
by
the
taste
but
its
still
a
well
balanced
and
pretty
solid
beer

light
easy

great
beer
very

thanks
a
lot
rob
if
this
beer
was
a
singer
it
would
be
somewhere
in
the
barry
manilowbilly
joel
elton
john
range
nothing
to
make
you
say
wow
but
it
has
moments
of
excellence
and
theres
nothing
offensive
going
on
id
have
wished
for
a
tad
more
strength
in
the
aroma
and
taste
areas
but
even
so
id
happily
have
this
one
again
feel
and
drinkability
as
aforementioned
this
one
is
bone
dry
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
higher
giving
this
one
a
cleansing
feel
on
the
palate
with
the
real
dry
character
of
this
beer
i
feel
that
the
higher
levels
of
carbonation
help
to
offset
the
dryness
as
well
as
to
bring
out
the
fruitiness
in
here
overall
everything
works
real
well
toghether
feel
and
taste
each
work
to
make
this
beer
the
most
it
can
be
this
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
the
taste
and
feel
though
are
rather
weak
overall
it
is
mostly
the
character
of
dry
bland
faintly
bitter
lemon
soda
with
hints
of
yeast
and
raisiny
alcohol
it
starts
slightly
more
raisiny
and
with
a
fairly
strong
grain
quality
that
takes
over
at
the
finish
and
in
the
aftertatse
on
the
first
couple
sips
but
these
elements
vanish
rapidly
soon
it
has
almost
no
aftertaste
at
all
and
just
is
dry
and
bland
from
start
to
finish
it
seems
rather
fizzy
and
a
bit
watery
too
however
it
is
decent
to
drink
and
rather
refreshing
in
a
way
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
a
very
sessionable
belgian
pale
overall
a
pretty
solid
and
sessionable
belgian
in
its
own
glass
poured
brilliant
goldhoney
hue
until
i
deposited
the
last
ounce
from
the
bottle
which
clouded
it
up
and
gave
it
a
murky
orange
glint
the
head
was
offwhite
and
foamy
with
nice
lacing
and
staying
power
the
smell
made
me
think
of
corn
syrup
yeast
honey
soda
biscuit
refreshing
tartness
in
the
taste
sour
flash
here
and
there
and
over
ripe
fruit
hints
with
yeast
backdrop
neither
bitterness
nor
malt
predominant
citrus
and
spice
was
in
the
mix
but
muted
i
would
definately
think
this
was
belgian
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
still
well
worth
trying
i
still
have
the
8
and
the
10
from
the
lcbo
gift
pack
to
try
so
ill
look
forward
to
that
dok
sipper
not
much
more
to
say
medium
bodied
with
a
perky
persistent
carbonation
this
is
a
superb
belgian
sessioner
with
a
good
deal
of
depth
and
change
throughout
its
probably
my
favorite
of
the
maredsous
line
its
always
great
to
find

nothing
exciting
but
solid
the
taste
is
a
slight
dissapointment
after
the
smell
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
hides
some
of
the
flavors
otherwise
there
are
lots
of
citrus
fruits
and
a
quite
yeasty
aftertaste
a
nice
touch
of
hops
round
of
the
taste
in
the
same
way
as
the
smell
meh
kind
of
average
drinkability
ive
had
me
a
few
and
so
shall
you
this
is
a
ok
belgian
pale
ale
quite
interesting
primarily
due
to
its
aftertaste
best
head
ever
poured
clear
gold
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
candy
sugar
and
spice
taste
was
very
understated
typical
belgiansweet
with
a
nice
malty
back
more
yeast
ester
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
and
settles
light
mouthfeel
a
decent
bpa
not
very
bold
and
anemic
in
the
hop
department
but
tastey
and
easy
to
quaff
nonetheless
i
dont
know
what
gives
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
on
many
spread
out
occasions
before
tonight
but
sitting
down
with
it
now
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
underwhelmed
ill
be
sure
my
scores
reflect
a
medium
but
as
far
as
blonds
of
this
milieu
go
this
failed
to
set
itself
apart
i
still
love
the
maredsous
series
but
will
definitely
have
the
8
and
10
ahead
of
this
in
the
lineup
overall
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
in
the
maredsous
range
i
would
certainly
recommend
i
really
like
this
one
good
stuff
smell
is
rather
weak
and
mostly
floral
sweetness
with
addition
of
citrus
taste
is
spicy
with
some
nice
sourness
high
carbonation
as
well
aftertaste
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
but
bitterness
is
more
pronounced
it
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
drink
d
a
good
belgian
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
because
of
the
hype
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
perhaps
not
as
intense
andor
flavorful
as
the
8
and
10
but
a
solid
beer
at
a
manageable

this
is
a
pleasant
belgian
offering
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
very
flavorful
not
a
beer
ill
be
rushing
back
for
hope
the
other
2
offerings
are
better
all
in
all
it
is
still
a
very

not
great
but
i
will
call
this
an

a
tasty
and
very
sessionable
belgian
pale

def
worth
a
go
on
the
whole
a
good
beer
with
decent
drinkability
that
is
both
worth
a
try
and
the
price
a
great
accompaniment
with
a
variety
of
food
from
fried
polenta
with
cheese
to
belgian
waffles
with
chocolate
syrup
both
of
which
i
have
paired
it
with
at
belgian
beer

in
barra

remarkable
beer
and
unlike
other
belgian
blondes
not
cloying
or
heavy
i
could
drink
this
all
afternoon
however
when
drinking
i
felt
a
very
light
beer
with
a
small
barley
taste
bitterlike
mouthfeel
goes
down
too
fast
i
honestly
expected
a
heavierbodied
beer
for
its
smell
and
abv
6
but
i
found
it
very
light
and
easygoing
d
its
certainly
worth
a
go
and
in
my
opinion
is
easily
the
best
of
the
maredsous
offerings
d
approachable
engaging
but
i
dont
think
i
could
session
it
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
in
terms
of
flavor
theres
not
a
great
deal
to
deal
with
its
a
bit
spicy
which
is
pretty
cool
but
the
hops
never
enter
the
scene
in
a
dashing
fashion
leaving
much
to
be
desired
in
the
end
result
this
is
a
very
good
well
made
beer
it
is
high
quality
just
not
exactly
to
my
taste
but
still
very
enjoyable
as
well
as
being
a
joy
to
look
at

it
comes
in
a
large
brown
bottle
with
a
thin
neck
and
bulbous
top
it
pours
a
muddy
copper
with
an
overly
big
beige
head
the
head
may
be
a
result
of
all
that
pent
up
effervescence
trying
to
funnel
through
that
thin
bottleneck
the
aroma
of
malt
hops
yeast
and
alcohol
hmmm
the
ingredients
are
not
all
that
obvious
and
fades
with
the
head
the
medium
malt
body
contains
a
lightly
sour
yeasty
flavor
a
mild
sweetness
and
an
astringent
and
lightly
citrus
bitterness
its
just
a
tad
watery
and
lacking
in
upfront
aromas
and
flavors
but
i
like
it
and
it
blends
and
balances
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
overall
very
disappointing
i
will
try
another
but
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
obtain
for
me
came
out
a
deep
clear
orangish
gold
under
a
firm
but
bubbly
off
white
head
which
lingered
well
and
left
some
very
good
lace
the
nose
was
fruity
sweet
while
the
mouth
was
too
heavily
carbonated
but
light
in
texture
the
initial
taste
has
the
typical
francophone
fruity
sweetness
the
hops
come
on
strong
soon
thereafter
though
leaving
a
very
crisp
just
this
side
of
harsh
impression
the
aftertaste
is
mildly
bitter
but
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
prefer
overall
an
excellent
beer
but
still
missing
something
had
this
on

at
the

squarea
real
nice

with

and
a
slight

aroma
taste
is
slightly
yeasty
with
some
nice
fruity
tones
almost
to
easy
to
drink
seeing
i
was
on
the
roof
outside
drinking
this
it
seemed
to
go
down
even
easier
real
nice
count
me
in
only
draw
back
is
the
price
but
i
think
its
worth
it
on
this

fine

the

is

citrus
and
quite
pleasant
begins
sweet
top
has
a
moderate
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
modestly
acidic
pleasantly
hopped
quite
dry
aftertaste
as
for
me
i
normally
dont
care
for
blondes
at
least
where
beer
is
concerned
but
i
find
this
one
quite
quaffable
o
the
thin
body
might
not
have
been
so
objectionable
if
the
flavor
profile
had
been
more
notable
id
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
seek
it
out
not
one
of
unibroues
better
offerings

decent

overall
o
surprised
in
a
great
way
wasnt
expecting
such
powerful
flavor
from
a
lower
abv
beer
when
will
i
learn
but
i
got
great
clearly
presented
and
natural
flavors
unibroue
captures
my
heart
again
i
remember
buying
one
of
those
unibroue
mixed
packs
a
few
years
ago
in
order
to
try
this
stuff
its
been
a
while
so
lets
give
it
another
go
eh
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
bandaid
belgian
yeast
a
twinge
of
dry
maple
syrup
and
light
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
some
light
orange
zest
and
a
richer
less
phenolic
smoke
though
its
still
pretty
mild
in
the
grand
scheme
of
this
glasss
things
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
lightlysmoked
bpa
good
times
as
usual
from
unibroue
well
this
one
was
pretty
much
nothing
like
advertised
on
its
label
its
rather
light
refreshing
and
quaffable
not
really
full
bodied
per
say
and
hardly
leaves
an
aftertaste
more
importantly
if
you
pick
this
up
because
you
expect
a
smokey
or
whiskey
like
flavor
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
as
i
dont
detect
those
flavors
at
all
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
got
a
bit
of
that
yeasty
funk
floral
and
spicy
notes
like
coriander
or
clove
banana
bubblegum
its
session
able
and
would
make
a
great
summertime
brew
picked
this
up
in
the
bargain
bin
for
3
and
its
still
in
date
and
all
nothing
extrodinary
but
just
drinkable
refreshing
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
without
being
extremely
complex
for
what
it
is
its
quite
good
i
give
it
about
the
same
rating
it
currently
has
going
for
it
87
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
ive
ever
had
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
very
complex
especially
as
it
warms
although
it
is
complex
it
is
still
very
light
bodied
and
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
unibroue
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
for
sure
easy
drinking
beer
similar
taste
and
look
as
the
hoegaarden
nice
combination
while
eating
a
smoked
meat
but
as
a
regular
beer
there
is
nothing
to
spectacular
i
enjoyed
more
than
hoegaarden
than
this
one
but
hey
good
job
unibroue
extremely
good

d
its
a
nice
every
day
beer
yeasty
of
course
its
on
lees
mild
banana
ester
followed
by
bready
malt
then
a
little
splash
of
spicy
grass
hops
i
suppose
followed
by
a
tiny
bit
of
roast
caramel
nice
and
carbonated
but
not
too
thin
bubbly
a
pretty
damn
wellbalanced
drinkable
and
classy
beer
o
simple
and
refreshing
thats
what
makes
this
one
so
good
not
super
complex
but
does
enough
things
very
well
that
you
want
to
drink
it
again
overall
great
refreshing
brew
from
my
favorite
canadians
eh
c
aroma
and
taste
are
strong
a
nd
nice
belgian
yeast
and
light
fruit
apples
and
pears
good
balance
between
the
yeast
flavor
and
the
sweetness
from
the
fruit
mouthfeel
is
rich
for
a
5
5
beer
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
o
probably
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
that
ive
tried
and
since
its
not
imported
from
overseas
it
was
much
cheaper
than
the
other
comparable
belgians
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
is
inoffensive
but
thats
no
good
reason
to
drink
it
d
this
was
a
decent
belgian
ale
but
the
scent
and
taste
were
really
simplistic
it
didnt
have
any
unique
character
like
i
hoped
the
body
was
a
little
weak
too
but
the
finish
was
pretty
smooth
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
meh
overall
now
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
brew
but
it
falls
a
little
short
of
the
other
unibroue
beers
i
have
had
thus
far
certainly
a
worthy
beer
to
take
down
as
it
really
does
out
compete
most
in
the
class
although
i
feel
my
expectations
were
a
bit
too
high
and
hence
i
was
slightly
disappointed
overall
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
was
not
overly
impressed
o
a
5
5
full
of
flavor
and
as
usual
a
great
belgian
yeastiness
showing
a
wide
spectrum
of
flavors
unibroue
never
disappoints
they
are
the
western
worlds
answer
to
belgium
beer
nicely
carbonated
very
pleasant
i
had
become
bored
with
unibroue
but
this
renewed
my
faith
in
them

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smoked

supposedly
used
in

is
almost
nonexistent
in

o
been
waiting
a
long

to
get

to
try
this

it

near

great
stuff
while
unibroue
doesnt

a

it
can

be

thing

i
wouldnt
really
call
it
being
consistent
i
would
call
it
being
dependable
oh
and
as
others
have
stated
in
previous
reviews
i
found
absolutely
no
whiskey
or
smoke
notes
in
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
which
is
fine
by
me
poured
a
dark
orange
body
with
decent
head
and
minor
lace
aroma
is
spicy
with
hint
of
whiskey
and
bourbon
as
well
as
some
belgian
yeast
and
hints
of
tropical
fruits
and
earthy
hops
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
smooth
from
yeast
as
well
a
little
oakiness
there
are
hints
of
candi
sugar
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
and
these
flavors
are
balanced
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
finish
is
complemented
by
slight
alcohol
bite
the
whiskey
and
some
peppery
spices
outstanding
belgian
pale
ale
with
smooth
but
full
malt
taste
and
texture
and
some
restrained
banana
yeast
notes
only
disappointment
was
i
was
expecting
more
of
the
smoked
whiskey
notes
on
the
malt
but
that
had
more
to
do
with
my
expectations
the
subtlety
could
easily
be
viewed
as
a
positive
as
well
o
with
all
of
the
banana
flavors
from
the
yeast
this
beer
seemed
like
a
cross
between
a
hefeweizen
and
a
belgian
pale
ale
o
i
wish
the
whiskeylike
flavors
and
aromas
were
slightly
more
present
than
they
are
in
this
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
and
enjoyable
brew
with
a
very
traditional
belgian
profile
prost
if
theres
whiskey
in
this
it
is
wellmasked
but
i
am
not
complaining
because
the
taste
is
heavenly
with
its
toasted
belgian
maltiness
yeast
brown
sugar
honey
maybe
and
low
bitterness
at
the
end
delightful
all
around
it
deserves
the
high
ratings
it
is
getting
o
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
i
paired
it
with
salmon
over
rice
and
asparagus
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
amazing
a
full
favour
belgian
pale
ale
build
on
that
strong
unibroue
yeast
poured
from
a
355
ml
bottle
pours
a
orangish
yellow
with
amber
or
brown
highlights
nose
is
dried
fruit
smoked
meat
and
spice
similar
notes
on
the
palate
but
tastes
a
bit
like
a
smoked
witbier
hearty
and
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
pours
a
murky
orangeamber
with
a
small
amount
of
quickbreaking
head
aroma
is
very
malty
like
cornbread
with
hints
of
caramel
and
light
smoke
yeasty
some
pear
and
apple
fruity
notes
as
well
palate
is
quite
similar
with
sweet
corn
and
caramel
flavors
a
tinge
of
smoke
but
no
scotch
ale
in
this
regard
dry
husks
pears
and
apples
maybe
a
touch
of
banana
vanilla
and
some
coriander
or
other
mild
citrus
spice
all
in
all
a
fairly
unique
belgian
pale
with
unibroue
character
one
of
the
more
difficult
unibroues
to
track
down
at
least
in
these
parts
perhaps
a
bit
undercarbonated
finish
is
persistent
sweet
and
mildly
acidic
worthwhile
and
i
am
tempted
to
provide
higher
ratings
o
this
was
the
elusive
unibroue
beer
for
me
one
of
only
two
of
their
regular
brews
that
i
hadnt
tried
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
pretty
well
though
i
am
a
little
suspicious
that
i
may
have
a
bad
bottle
on
my
hands
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
bpa
not
bad
not
great
id
choose
most
all
other
unibroue
beers
over
this
one
in
all
truthfulness
this
is
my
favorite
of
their
beers
i
mean
it
is
a
beer
that
has
a
solid
gimmick
brewed
with
whiskey
malt
because
lumberjacks
were
fans
of
the
old
beer
and
a
shot
and
pulls
it
off
the
beer
is
actually
better
for
it
it
is
the
most
different
in
comparison
to
their
other
beers
that
i
have
had
obviously
but
is
not
to
be
missed
o
im
not
a
huge
belgian
guy
nor
whisky
guy
but
this
is
interesting
nonetheless
the
whisky
and
smoke
flavours
are
pretty
subtle
smell
wast
all
that
distinct
from
other
unibroue
surprisingly
this
is
only
5
5
making
it
near
sessionable
territory
i
would
drink
this
again
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
over
some
other
unibroues
though
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
bpa
nothing
outstanding
about
it
i
just
really
enjoy
it
pours
a
fairly
hazy
orangeybrown
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
and
some
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
belgian
yeast
fruit
and
dark
sugars
a
bit
of
smokey
malt
comes
across
as
well
well
spiced
as
well
taste
is
quite
yeasty
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
bits
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
some
ripe
fruit
flavours
light
sweetness
with
a
spicy
finish
mediumhig
carbonation
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
decent
overall
feel
solid
and
really
drinkable
like
that
this
has
a
low
abv
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
for
sure
this
one
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
character
is
good
ripe
fruit
on
this
one
with
the
dark
ale
character
youd
expect
was
surprised
to
see
it
on
tap
and
glad
to
be
able
to
try
it
had
this
on
tap
at
gigs
in
london
they
listed
it
as
a
smoked
ale
but
i
didnt
detect
too
much
in
smoke
flavours
it
definately
has
the
typical
unibroue
belgian
yeast
taste
to
this
but
its
not
as
strong
as
the
other
beers
in
their
lineup
theres
some
spiceyness
in
the
taste
with
faint
fruit
flavours
like
apple
and
grapes
in
there
as
well
definately
another
quality
belgian
brew
from
unibroue
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
pretty
tasty
not
what
i
was
expecting
to
me
this
is
a
modified
hefeweizen
medium
to
light
feel
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
light
and
easy
drinking
this
reminds
me
of
a
light
dubble
but
with
more
depth
the
alcohol
was
well
integrated
this
is
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
sometime
o
overall
its
smooth
but
refreshing
bubbly
but
can
be
taken
seriously
the
flavours
run
from
crisp
fruits
to
smooth
butter
to
a
dry
finish
at
first
i
didnt
like
this
unibroue
as
much
as
the
others
but
on
second
tasting
im
finding
it
more
complex
and
interesting
definitely
worth
a
second
try
overall
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
by
unibroue
the
warm
spice
palate
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
other
flavours
and
does
not
overpower
the
beer
smooth
and
refreshing
worth
a
try
the
smoked
malt
in
this
is
extremely
subtle
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
for
the
best
given
their
characterful
house
yeast
and
the
fact
that
it
is
peat
smoked
malt
but
i
still
feel
like
i
am
missing
out
on
a
more
pungent
smoke
character
interestingly
enough
the
house
yeast
dominates
the
profile
of
this
beer
so
if
you
like
that
then
this
beer
is
pretty
enjoyable
i
just
wish
something
else
came
through
a
bit
more
big
yeasty
and
fruity
aromas
apricots
candied
apples
with
light
woody
and
peppery
background
notes
the
peppery
presence
comes
to
life
afloat
abundant
carbonation
cutting
through
a
robust
malty
mix
of
honey
toasty
toffee
and
caramel
yeast
and
tangy
fruit
abound
its
quite
complex
a
sipper
really
even
at
this
modest
abv
quite
satisfying
hazy
copper
body
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
well
tons
of
belgian
esters
on
the
nose
along
with
pepper
and
apple
juice
the
body
is
spicy
with
an
odd
numbing
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
the
lack
of
smokiness
is
distressing
to
me
as
i
was
hoping
for
a
stronger
presence
even
knowing
that
its
there
i
find
it
hard
to
discern
a
real
nice
belgian
beer
but
sadly
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
o
the
beer
itself
was
good
but
im
not
really
sure
what
style
it
fits
in
i
guess
bpa
is
the
most
suitable
theres
no
trace
of
the
smoked
malt
whiskey
this
might
be
unibroues
most
drinkable
beer
on
tap
and
poured
into
jarlike
pint
at
chucks
85th
aroma
is
enjoyable
it
smells
somewhat
close
to
a
wheat
beer
mild
sweetness
appearance
was
murky
honey
blond
with
minimal
head
taste
was
great
at
first
but
sort
of
just
fades
away
to
something
a
bit
bland
theres
nothing
overpowering
about
this
very
slight
bitterness
slight
citrus
slight
sweetness
its
just
all
around
a
very
subtle
drink
palate
was
smooth
and
bubbly
very
drinkable
overall
it
wasnt
anything
special
but
still
worth
trying
at
least
o
a
tasty
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
ale
that
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
from
unibroue
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
get
6ers
of
this
definitely
worth
a
grab
and
will
certainly
quench
your
thirst
overall
a
decent
brew
pretty
tasty
though
maybe
not
the
most
drinkable
to
be
frank
i
think
it
could
have
taken
a
higher
abv
i
like
having
it
with
greasy
and
gravy
soaked
food
unibroue
never
fails
to
impress
refreshing
to
drink
and
good
blend
of
fruits
and
flavors
would
definitely
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
or
case
o
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
belgian
pale
ale
on
tap
last
night
at
meadhall
in
cambridge
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
glass
hazy
orange
colored
body
with
a
creamy
white
head
minimal
lacing
smell
was
a
bit
sugary
and
earthy
taste
was
good
as
i
enjoyed
the
balance
between
the
sweet
malt
and
the
tart
belgian
yeast
the
one
thing
that
let
me
down
was
the
real
absence
of
the
smoked
character
that
i
was
looking
for
the
beer
promises
smoked
malt
but
its
not
upfront
instead
its
hidden
way
back
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
raftman
was
a
great
belgian
style
pale
ale
but
i
thought
it
let
me
down
on
the
smoked
aspect
a
really
smoky
bpa
sounds
like
a
good
idea
but
this
isnt
it
o
im
a
big
fan
of
unibroue
beers
and
this
does
not
disappoint
it
adds
an
interesting
twist
on
their
theme
that
has
worked
for
years
will
definitely
buy
again
o
its
a
big
beer
for
sure
lots
of
belgian
character
with
pale
ale
accents
the
whiskey
malt
is
very
subtle
but
a
nice
touch
merits
a
repeat
purchase
85
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
wish
that
the
smokiness
that
was
supposed
to
be
present
had
shown
up
that
said
its
still
a
solid
beer
it
just
isnt
up
to
the
standards
of
most
other
unibroue
beers
overall
impression
now
ive
had
in
bottle
and
ontap
this
is
a
great
brew
from
unibroue
and
think
their
beers
cant
get
any
better
cheers
drink
i
havent
seen
this
around
to
much
down
here
so
when
a
750
got
busted
out
was
happy
to
try
it
over
all
a
very
solid
effort
one
i
would
pair
with
savory
leek
and
pumpkin
crostade
with
rip
cheese
and
pomegranate
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
unibroues
best
next
time
i
would
just
stick
with
one
of
their
other
offerings
d
not
up
there
amongst
my
favourite
unibroue
offerings
but
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
nonetheless
i
find
this
as
more
of
a
refreshing
bpa
with
the
citrus
focus
and
higher
carbonation
worth
a
try
o
there
are
some
nice
ester
characters
with
a
good
wheat
and
caramel
flavor
the
unibroue
yeast
profile
is
a
nice
compliment
with
some
hints
of
hefeweizen
and
just
enough
smoke
to
make
it
interesting
o
not
the
best
unibroue
have
to
offer
but
interesting
and
very
nice
on
the
sweeter
and
maltier
side
but
works
well
with
the
fruity
unibroue
yeast
great
beer
notes
highly
drinkable
for
how
malty
yeasty
and
flavorful
it
is
very
deft
nice
mellow
smoke
character
is
appreciated
yet
it
remains
a
definite
thirst
quencher
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
character
but
otherwise
a
standout
for
a
while
i
was
seriously
thinking
that
i
would
never
be
able
to
taste
a
raftman
seeing
this
on
the
beer
menu
and
ontap
last
night
was
a
complete
shock
and
having
it
being
so
great
helped
make
my
night
at
38
degrees
a
dusky
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
nice
lacing
as
i
consume
smell
is
super
a
melange
of
light
bananas
apricots
pepper
some
soap
belgian
yeast
light
toasted
grains
smoke
and
earth
taste
follws
suit
with
a
lightly
soapy
front
that
flashes
the
fruits
and
spicy
pepper
on
its
way
to
a
dry
grainy
malt
core
it
lingers
forever
with
large
amounts
of
toasted
whole
grains
a
light
dry
sweetness
and
hint
of
lemon
more
dry
than
bitter
the
hops
are
earthy
and
mild
finish
is
long
and
complex
with
notes
of
cinnamon
coming
through
as
weel
as
more
toasted
malt
light
smoke
and
earth
feel
is
light
dry
and
quenching
mild
prickliness
is
spot
on
for
this
beer
a
real
winner
here
i
would
dare
say
unibroues
equivalent
to
orval
dry
and
super
complex
it
goes
down
like
a
thirst
quencher
but
demands
to
be
savored
and
appreciated
great
beer
too
bad
it
is
not
availible
in
any
quantities
here
or
i
would
be
stocking
up
people
are
being
real
beer
snobby
with
this
one
get
a
grip
it
s
amazing
beer
its
good
for
girls
refreshing
and
spicy
yay
this
is
a
beer
guys
can
introduce
to
their
gfriends
an
awsome
entry
into
the
world
of
belgium
unibroue
fin
du
la
monde
is
next
apologize
for
sp
errors
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
cloudy
looking
copper
color
the
head
was
big
and
white
at
first
once
it
settles
it
leaves
a
few
spots
on
top
where
the
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
yeastyand
a
little
fruity
the
flavor
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
apple
taste
coming
off
of
it
there
is
also
a
decent
amount
of
spice
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
is
medium
bodied
overall
a
little
different
than
a
typical
belgian
pale
ale
the
fruit
sets
it
apart
from
the
majority
worth
trying
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
but
lacking
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
tasty
beer
but
it
could
easily
be
improved
o
great
beer
on
this
warm
summer
night
approved
by
the
male
and
female
perspective
overall
pretty
good
raftman
has
a
good
range
of
tastes
a
comparatively
low
level
of
alcohol
and
a
nice
crisp
effervescence
the
body
was
crisp
and
dry
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
brews
overall
another
nice
job
from
what
i
consider
to
be
the
best
brewery
in
canadia
overall
this
beer
has
the
distinct
unibroue
yeast
character
and
some
interesting
malt
flavors
and
a
very
restrained
smoked
flavor
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
o
surprised
by
this
one
turned
out
to
be
complex
and
interesting
to
drink
sweetness
didnt
overwhelm
me
drank
two
and
never
wanted
for
anything
m
a
chewy
ale
that
hasnt
shaken
its
sweet
side
i
was
glad
for
the
opportunity
its
been
many
years
however
my
rosetinted
din
of
my
memory
recalls
more
of
a
peaty
presence
its
quite
nice
i
set
the
bar
really
high
for
unibroue
and
the
description
sounded
ideal
to
my
taste
it
ended
up
not
quite
living
up
to
my
expectation
in
a
bottle
but
was
better
from
a
growler
unibroue
just
doesnt
disappoint
nice
enough
beer
but
nothing
to
really
get
excited
about
either
also
as
the
beer
warmed
and
after
a
couple
of
sips
of
ruination
i
did
notice
some
light
smoke
and
whiskey
in
this
beer
as
well
750ml
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
with
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
of
yeast
spices
and
fruits
taste
has
the
typical
unibroue
yeast
taste
spice
and
malt
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
though
i
wish
unibroue
would
try
using
different
yeast
once
in
a
while
this
log
drivers
waltz
wont
please
the
beer
folks
completely
but
it
still
was
a
decent
beer
a
low
abv
would
make
for
a
great
session
brew
its
of
the
kind
i
like
to
drink
so
its
hard
to
knock
it
but
when
i
see
unibroues
website
describe
raftman
as
a
a
peat
smoked
whisky
malt
ale
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
yeast
this
would
be
a
good
beer
with
dinner
a
very
light
tasting
beer
peach
but
with
some
nice
sweet
flavor
that
captures
that
whiskey
profile
well
overall
the
alcohol
content
is
within
a
moderate
range
that
would
allow
for
extended
samplings
without
threat
of
inebriation
well
crafted

a

intro

im
talking
like
90
of
the
glass
nonetheless
the
raftman
is
thus
an
excellent
beer
if
you
are
just
introducing
yourself
to
a
new
world
of
flavor
and
it
is
also
amazing
for
anyone
looking
for
a
great
session
beer
it
would
pair
nicely
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
from
grilled
or
smoked
meat
to
earthy
cheeses
spinach
salads
nuts
or
even
light
vanilla
cakes
d
very
nice
brew
great
in
the
nose
fades
slightly
on
the
palate
lots
of
tannins
on
this
brew
a
perfect
food
beer
jd
an
unusual
brew
rustic
and
not
made
to
a
particular
style
per
se
reminds
me
of
a
superior
homebrew
really
d
the
pungency
of
the
beer
makes
it
an
unlikely
return
for
me
drinkability
not
a
style
i
partake
in
often
but
this
is
a
very
good
one
i
particularily
enjoyed
its
rich
feel
and
robust
toasty
malt
good
mouthfeel
but
very
good
drinkability
similarities
to
other
unibroue
offerings
butstill
very
different
nothing
too
good
but
pleasent
drinkability
really
didnt
care
for
this
one
d
tasty
and
though
mild
pretty
complex
very
easy
to
drink
except
the
carbonations
makes
it
a
bit
filling
pretty
good
though
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
for
tasty
enough
its
undeniably
unibroue
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
isnt
a
beer
i
would
drink
regularly
very
good
offering
from
a
very
good
brewery
raftman
pours
with
a
generous
tight
eggshellcolored
head
dissipating
pretty
quickly
leaving
little
or
no
lacing
behind
made
with
whisky
malt
this
amber
ale
takes
on
the
smoky
fragrance
and
a
hint
of
flavor
of
a
nice
highland
scotch
trending
to
tart
green
apple
and
grass
notes
as
it
warms
that
this
beer
is
so
crisp
and
lively
on
the
tongue
owes
to
the
belgian
styles
that
quebecs
unibroue
is
known
for
a
deadly
combination
if
there
ever
was
one
luckily
raftman
is
only
5
5
alcohol
making
it
a
very
sessionable
brew
d
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
both
in
feel
and
flavor
but
a
good
overall
brew
and
it
finished
easy
enough
refreshing
d
very
easy
to
drink
good
refreshing
beer
thintasting
belgian
without
a
lot
to
distinguish
it
its
not
offensive
its
just
not
memorable
or
special
i
like
belgians
that
are
good
food
companions
and
this
would
fit
that
definition
but
it
lacks
a
distinct
style
it
can
call
its
own
i
wonder
if
the
brothers
have
tasted
this
beer
since
they
reviewed
it
8
years
ago
pours
with
a
kind
of
gross
dark
iced
tea
color
and
a
surprisingly
white
head
i
see
some
lees
churning
around
in
the
standard
unibroue
chunky
fashion
it
looks
a
little
murky
as
i
look
through
the
glass
it
has
the
nose
of
a
traditional
belgian
abbey
dubbel
light
and
smooth
with
a
hint
of
candi
sugar
faint
malt
and
complex
yeasty
smells
i
smell
sweet
apples
grain
husk
and
a
little
acidity
or
tartness
its
a
little
dry
smelling
the
taste
is
very
mellow
and
smooth
it
doesnt
have
that
citrus
punch
that
most
of
unibroues
beers
have
instead
it
has
a
sessionable
abv
and
a
more
subtle
and
tame
style
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
for
the
abv
because
of
the
body
being
so
full
the
aftertaste
shows
a
little
bit
of
neutral
hops
that
add
an
attempt
at
balance
but
dont
quite
get
there
this
is
definitely
a
predominantly
malty
beer
but
doesnt
wear
on
you
like
an
english
brown
ale
can
with
the
sugarysweet
aftertaste
some
tend
to
have
i
think
i
could
have
3
of
these
very
light

moderate

sweetness
noted
whisky
malt
used
to
create
this
delicious
sweet
malty
taste
particularly
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
if
it
didnt
smell
so
sweet
you
could
easily
dive
into
several
in
a
row
enjoyably
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
sweet
there
are
some
caramel
notes
to
the
beer
and
it
finishes
nicely
the
body
is
good
with
some
carbonation
on
the
palate
overall
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
by
them
but
its
solid
yeah
highly
drinkable
but
just
an
ok
beer
drinkability
not
as
distinctive
as
i
was
expecting
this
is
still
a
nice
lighter
belgian
style
ale
d
its
east
to
drink
not
off
putting
in
any
sense
but
its
very
weak
and
doesnt
live
up
to
its
siblings
this
is
actually
nice
but
it
still
falls
into
the
unibroue
habit
of
being
terribly
middle
of
the
road
for
me
its
like
a
poor
mans
duvel
which
is
ironic
because
im
pretty
sure
you
can
actually
buy
duvel
for
less
in
sydney
its
certainly
loads
better
than
la
fin
du
monde
though
i
think
unibroues
reputation
may
be
partly
based
on
the
fact
it
might
be
a
good
value
alternative
to
belgians
in
the
us
except
over
here
it
works
out
as
costing
about
the
same
as
belgians
the
mouth
feel
is
incredibly
creamy
and
smooth
i
like
it
but
somehow
i
do
not
want
to
keep
drinking
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
spices
and
fruits
taste
is
good
a
considerable
amount
of
spices
as
well
as
some
dark
fruits
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
brew
perhaps
this
bottle
of
raftman
wasnt
fresh
i
cant
decipher
the
freshness
code
on
the
bottle
but
my
guess
would
be
it
was
bottled
in
may
of
2009
at
5
5
this
probably
doesnt
age
well
this
was
th
efirst
unibroue
product
ive
ever
had
where
i
have
been
less
than
impressed
i
will
give
them
a
pass
since
everything
else
ive
ever
had
has
been
outstanding
id
even
be
willing
to
try
this
again
providing
it
was
fresh
the
overall
palate
of
this
beer
is
real
understated
mild
casklike
and
i
hesitate
to
say
watered
down
the
complete
nonoffensiveness
makes
it
quite
drinkable
like
herbal
tea
make
sure
your
palate
is
squeaky
clean
before
trying
this
and
perhaps
youll
get
more
from
it
than
i
did
not
bad
but
not
exciting
mix
of
sprightly
wheat
maltyeast
character
and
less
sprightly
sweet
maltiness
tastes
darker
than
it
looks
though
its
not
heavy
quite
complex
but
not
sure
the
complexity
works
all
that
well
certainly
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
one
bottle
is
enough
good
drinkability
the
sweet
aspect
takes
it
down
a
notch
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
d
damned
solid
belgian
pale
ale
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
such
a
fine
brewery
as
unibroue
im
wishing
i
had
more
then
one
of
these
but
in
the
meantime
ill
thank
moniker
for
the
one
i
do
have
unibroue
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
canada
and
i
wish
i
could
buy
more
of
it
out
west
these
beers
are
the
best
value
in
alberta
and
i
cant
wait
to
go
to
quebec
and
try
the
rest
of
the
lineup
i
can
appreciate
this
as
a
well
made
beer
but
the
style
doesnt
really
rock
my
boat
easy
drinking
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
good
finally
getting
to
drink
this
one
i
didnt
expect
all
the
carbonation
the
whiskey
malt
was
subtle
but
it
worked
really
well
with
this
beer
i
recommend
this
one
the
combination
of
the
effervescent
carbonation
and
the
sweet
orange
overtones
balance
well
with
the
complexity
of
the
smoked
whisky
malt
to
make
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
more
complex
than
most
of
its
kind
it
was
almost
a
littel
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
smooth
light
well
carbonated
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
things
id
rather
drink
instead
not
bad
and
some
may
really
take
to
the
beer
good
beer
but
not
my
fav
a
very
good
belgian
not
very
pale
ale
impressive
complexity
for
the
modest
5
5
alcohol
content
though
bordering
on
oversweet
the
smoked
whisky
malt
is
an
interesting
ingredient
though
i
wonder
how
many
drinkers
could
tell
it
was
smoked
if
they
werent
told
im
not
sure
i
could
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
cool
to
see
something
with
recognizable
traits
of
a
style
that
have
been
stretched
in
different
directions
to
make
something
unique
dont
really
detect
anything
whiskyish
about
it
but
machts
nicht
edit
let
it
warm
up
too
room
temp
hoping
to
get
more
flavour
nope
really
too
much
water
in
this
disappointing
but
i
stand
by
the
rest
of
my
review
and
rating
overall
a
very
unique
and
subtle
flavorful
belgian
style
pale
ale
i
do
appreciate
the
nuance
of
eversoslightly
smoked
malts
but
the
spiciness
and
tartness
is
what
floats
my
boat
as
the
beer
warms
a
bitter
nutty
walnutflavor
is
brought
out
complex
and
delicate
with
a
dry
chalky
clean
finish
i
do
like
this
beer
very
much
value
a
little
overpriced
considering
some
domestic
versions
of
a
belgian
ale
that
are
better
and
cheaper
pranqster
smooth
with
a
medium
effervescence
mediumfull
body
notes
of
spice
in
aftertaste
mostly
clove
and
cinnamon
another
solid
brew
from
the
folks
at
unibroue
but
slightly
less
than
the
other
offerings
of
theirs
ive
had
raftman
is
plenty
easy
to
drink
with
a
refreshing
tartness
and
sufficient
flavour
to
appease
me
it
simply
lacks
the
smokiness
i
expected
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
very
pleasant
to
drink
easy
going
and
tasty
not
a
big
brew
by
any
stretch
but
has
enough
balls
to
make
me
want
about
a
dozen
more
of
these
i
got
a
spicy
aroma
of
apples
with
a
sour
hint
to
it
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
the
same
spice
and
to
me
tasted
like
a
really
light
version
of
scotch
ale
it
was
very
thin
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
thought
it
was
okay
but
probably
wont
taste
this
one
again
for
some
time
overall
this
is
pretty
fantastic
flavorful
enjoyableand
very
light
this
is
easy
to
drink
over
an
extended
period
of
time
this
brew
is
light
drinking
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
sessionable
brew
the
only
strike
against
is
the
lack
of
a
good
headlace
another
fine
brew
from
unibroue
d
could
be
a
long
session
beer
due
to
the
low
alcohol
5
5
and
light
flavors
d
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
easily
the
evolving
flavors
kept
me
going
back
for
more
a
very
nice
beer
great
atmosphere
really
impressive
appearance
in
the
right
glass
nose
is
full
and
lightly
complex
flavor
is
simpler
but
a
nice
combination
of
malt
and
sweet
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
a
great
brew
raftman
is
just
delicious
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
and
has
a
yeastywheaty
aroma
that
is
just
excellent
palette
is
like
a
bourbon
likely
from
the
whisky
malt
very
bubbly
there
is
a
whisky
flavor
in
the
background
that
makes
it
quite
warming
but
it
is
not
very
strong
it
just
adds
to
the
character
very
smooth
and
a
little
but
very
pleasant
aftertaste
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
hazy
amber
in
appearance
it
has
a
big
sticky
white
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
light
toasted
grains
sweet
notes
the
flavors
of
caramel
and
vanilla
dominate
lingering
sweet
finish
the
body
of
this
beer
is
light
and
flavorful
making
it
almost
too
easy
to
drink
the
mouth
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
aggressive
carbonation
all
of
these
result
in
quite
the
drinkable
package
i
will
be
trying
it
again
soon
taste
cherry
vanilla
for
some
reason
comes
to
mind
tangy
sweet
and
malty
as
it
tails
off
there
is
bitterness
but
very
mild
and
then
a
crisp
finish
refressing
and
drinkable
i
could
buy
a
sixpack
of
these
and
watch
the
maple
leafs
play
on
the
cbc
pours
a
murky
muddy
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
that
settles
to
about
a
finger
width
richly
aromatic
with
a
nose
of
tart
fruit
brown
sugar
and
funky
yeast
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
prominent
than
the
nose
suggested
good
body
medium
weight
with
nice
acidity
and
very
low
tanninshops
overall
a
very
good
brew
on
the
mellow
side
for
this
brewery
a
good
addition
to
the
lineup
poured
a
cloudy
medium
brown
into
a
snifter
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
good
lacing
smelled
woody
roasted
malty
nutty
sour
plum
and
tart
cherry
the
flavor
yielded
more
tart
cherry
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
smokiness
than
what
was
implied
by
the
aroma
but
the
feel
was
very
thin
i
appreciate
what
the
ubrew
crew
was
trying
to
accomplish
with
this
beer
but
the
smokyroasted
tart
sweetness
didnt
wow
me
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
this
was
a
nice
little
find
at
the
bottle
shop
a
beer
with
a
complex
malt
profile
and
an
assertive
floral
hoppyness
pours
an
extremely
hazy
brown
so
opaque
i
cant
see
moving
objects
through
the
glass
the
smell
reminds
me
of
any
other
unibroue
produc
the
taste
is
great
reminds
me
of
la
fin
du
monde
light
the
lower
abv
makes
this
a
unibroue
product
with
similar
quality
to
la
fin
or
maudite
but
without
the
higher
abv
love
this
and
would
definitely
get
it
again
this
is
a
treat
d
the
smoked
malt
is
really
very
light
and
adds
a
nice
dimension
to
the
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
with
a
moderate
head
that
rapidly
dissipated
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
musty
like
an
old
attic
the
taste
was
sour
cherries
later
i
got
a
more
traditional
fruity
taste
sweeter
the
feel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
ok
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
d
good
tasty
but
this
doesnt
stand
out
from
any
of
their
other
offerings
yummy
for
sure
but
if
i
had
one
unibroue
beer
to
pick
it
wouldnt
be
this
one
a
big
thanks
to
terryeckmeier
for
the
bottle
the
bottom
line
as
ive
said
before
i
think
unibroue
is
a
victim
of
their
own
success
in
a
pure
vacuum
almost
all
of
their
beers
are
solid
but
because
they
brew
in
a
fairly
rigid
style
the
brews
all
compete
with
each
other
raftman
is
a
nice
light
offering
i
think
they
are
overplaying
the
use
of
whisky
malts
though
as
a
single
malt
fan
i
expect
a
more
aggressive
flavour
when
the
whisky
tiein
is
featured
so
prominently
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
though
and
im
still
flummoxed
as
to
why
its
the
one
standard
offering
that
isnt
available
in
the
us
except
in
the
odd
little
variety
pack
that
has
the
chambly
beers
and
an
ephemere
one
thing
ill
definitely
give
this
beer
in
parting
exceptional
for
only
5
5
abv
and
that
alone
would
probably
be
enough
to
make
it
a
semiregular
in
my
glass
if
it
was
just
available
in
46
packs
in
the
states
not
a
bad
beer
moderatly
drinkable
but
by
no
means
great
drinkability
very
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
good
for
any
occasion
dont
drink
and
review
this
is
a
deserving
brew
and
i
hope
that
it
doesnt
continue
to
be
underrated
overall
another
solid
brew
from
unibroue
leaves
me
anxious
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
id
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
for
some
time
unibroue
again
doesnt
disappoint
although
its
somewhat
upsetting
that
i
lay
my
hands
on
a
bottle
just
as
unibroue
cuts
its
australian
supply
ah
well
d
pretty
good
but
their
are
better
hefes
or
witbiers
out
there
that
are
similar
yet
better
d
light
spicy
and
semi
refreshing
no
lingering
aftertaste
and
low
alcohol
pretty
easy
drinker
interesting
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
this
is
a
good
strat
to
a
session
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
these
all
night
but
a
good
flavorful
starter
d
very
drinkable
balanced
smooth
and
complex
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
first
belgian
pale
ales
excellent
beer
poured
amber
orange
with
a
decent
white
head
nose
is
malty
with
hints
of
spices
taste
is
classic
belgian
yeast
strain
hints
of
lemon
peppery
finish
is
primary
with
hops
taking
a
back
seat
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
beer
glides
gracefully
across
the
palate
in
classic
belgian
style
this
is
quite
the
drinkable
beer
light
but
somewhat
complex
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
dvery
easy
drinking
belgian
style
with
a
bitter
spice
finish
very
balanced
drinkability
while
it
is
a
little
to
thick
to
be
a
session
beer
for
me
its
flavor
and
its
nice
wheat
refreshing
factor
really
help
drinkability
this
can
be
a
drinkable
beer
the
low
abv
is
nice
but
the
strong
acidity
is
a
bit
offputting
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
all
of
its
characteristics
are
subtle
and
you
could
spend
some
quality
time
hunting
out
the
flavors
and
aromas
very
nice
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
balanced
and
complex
a
lot
of
great
flavours
very
clean
finish
in
the
unibroue
universe
this
is
a
dwarf
but
its
clearly
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
its
gargantuan
brethren
an
interesting
enough
ode
to
those
in
quebecs
history
who
adhered
to
the
one
whisky
one
beer
policy
that
im
also
quite
fond
of
the
whisky
malt
does
well
to
make
indeterminate
appearances
throughout
this
beer
and
overall
its
a
unique
and
approachable
offering
from
unibroue
a
smoked
belgian
pale
ale
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
ill
definately
have
to
get
more
of
these
the
beer
has
definitely
calmed
down
and
as
it
warms
and
there
is
a
little
more
of
the
whiskyalcohol
taste
coming
through
this
is
an
alright
beer
drinkable
but
not
one
i
would
actively
seek
out
the
smell
taste
and
feel
are
all
too
light
for
me
im
giving
it
an
extra
0
5
because
the
light
smokiness
is
kind
of
cool
its
the
only
other
unibroue
besides
ephemere
ive
had
which
weighs
in
at
5
5
i
guess
im
just
a
strong
beer
kind
of
guy
while
i
am
not
completely
blown
away
by
this
theres
really
little
that
is
wrong
with
it
other
than
the
lack
of
head
but
it
doesnt
taste
flat
like
a
lot
of
headless
beers
can
so
really
thats
just
nitpicking
medium
bodied
but
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
would
have
liked
the
initial
mouthfeel
seemed
way
too
bubbly
but
altogether
it
was
still
quite
refreshing
this
came
from
a
unibroue
4pack
sampler
and
i
can
say
that
this
was
my
personal
favorite
of
the
bunch
i
wont
be
picking
up
another
sampler
set
just
for
this
one
but
raftman
was
a
nice
note
to
finish
on
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
least
once
drinkability
quite
high
this
beer
is
superflavorful
not
especially
heavy
and
only
has
an
abv
5
5
really
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
its
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
im
sure
itd
be
nice
on
a
cold
winter
night
as
well
this
is
a
pleasantly
light
and
flavourful
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
quite
refreshing
a
very
nice
beer
at
any
time
of
year
this
is
strongly
suggested
for
a
goto
day
to
day
beer
a
good
beer
to
have
as
a
replacement
of
yellow
fizzy
beer
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
pretty
good
not
something
i
would
like
to
have
a
lot
of
but
something
good
overall
a
decent
brew
tastes
good
but
lacking
in
the
appearance
drinkability
pretty
tasty
and
wellbalanced
nice
complexity
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
aromas
are
of
belgian
yeast
clove
spice
with
a
slight
woody
malty
aroma
a
fruitiness
and
a
little
bit
of
funk
initial
flavor
is
sweet
tangy
yeasty
and
full
of
cinammon
clove
spice
this
inital
flavor
gives
way
to
a
more
intense
tang
citrus
and
sometimes
a
stronger
almost
metallic
tang
with
a
more
pronounced
funk
and
somewhat
fruity
finish
i
dont
think
the
funk
was
parmesan
cheese
or
stinky
foot
but
maybe
a
funky
distant
cousin
of
those
two
if
that
makes
any
sense
mouthfeel
is
actually
very
good
smooth
and
the
higher
carbonation
really
compliments
the
beer
drinkability
is
good
but
the
clove
spice
might
get
a
little
old
after
a
while
drinkability
a
little
bit
too
light
and
simple
for
my
taste
in
the
style
after
one
i
am
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
although
it
is
not
really
dissatisfying
overall
a
fine
belgian
pa
d
these
could
be
put
away
one
after
another
no
problem
its
super
light
refreshing
and
fruity
its
5
5
is
totally
tolerable
however
where
is
the
pale
ale
aspect
this
claims
to
be
its
got
the
belgian
style
down
fine
drinkability
very
good
i
love
the
lightly
flavored
beer
with
their
belgian
yeast
strain
it
makes
for
a
great
drinker
m
d
sparkling
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
champagne
finish
a
very
robust
flavoured
beer
with
a
more
accessible
alcohol
content
i
can
go
for
that
a
very
nicely
balanced
brew
and
one
that
im
glad
to
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
try
you
should
too
drinkability
could
definitely
have
another
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
some
pork
ribs
or
any
other
smoked
bbq
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
and
light
to
medium
in
body
no
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
very
interesting
brew
overall
to
me
this
is
more
of
a
quaffer
than
a
sipper
as
i
think
of
most
ubs
as
being
so
im
really
having
to
restrain
myself
with
this
oneoffer
in
all
im
really
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
with
it
well
other
than
duh
drink
it
since
its
so
different
from
the
rest
of
their
lineup
something
about
it
almost
drinks
like
a
rye
ale
but
when
i
ponder
the
canadian
whisky
rye
connexion
it
almost
makes
sense
it
really
perks
up
with
food
try
a
good
fresh
fish
or
smokedsmoky
meat
this
would
be
a
great
counterfoil
to
smoked
sausages
when
you
dont
want
a
rauchbier
it
also
sits
up
and
converses
with
roasted
asparagus
and
even
spaghetti
and
meatballs
isnt
out
of
the
question
really
glad
to
see
this
one
back
on
the
shelves
here
in
pa
i
remember
seeing
this
a
few
years
ago
at
a
bottle
shop
but
passed
it
up
since
the
bottle
was
covered
in
dust
and
the
best
by
date
had
been
blatantly
scratched
off
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
craft
ale
house
togo
for
around
3
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
and
after
stirring
up
the
yummies
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
appears
a
rather
cloudy
and
murky
honeyed
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
quickly
fading
off
white
head
nose
consists
of
lightly
smoked
grains
and
is
sweet
and
fruity
flavor
is
of
smoked
green
apples
spicy
yeast
a
touch
of
cracked
pepper
at
the
end
this
belgian
pale
is
at
the
very
least
medium
bodied
with
and
very
well
carbonated
super
dry
going
into
the
finish
nice
i
found
this
beer
very
underwhelming
i
just
didnt
get
a
lot
of
flavor
here
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
unibroue
beer
you
really
have
to
search
your
palate
to
get
any
nice
flavors
to
come
out
here
i
am
no
expert
on
belgian
ales
but
i
have
had
enough
to
know
that
they
pack
more
flavor
punch
than
this
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
rock
your
world
d
has
decent
drinkability
being
one
of
the
lighter
unibroue
beers
raftman
certainly
stands
well
for
its
abv
easy
to
drink
this
is
no
monster
abv
which
restricts
the
drinkability
a
fine
beer
from
one
of
the
worlds
great
beer
makers
notes
i
was
told
by
an
employee
at
world
wines
liquor
in
mentor
that
the
only
way
to
get
this
is
in
the
sampler
pack
well
she
said
that
they
do
not
make
the
raftman
in
the
750ml
bottles
anyway
i
would
love
to
find
4
or
6
packs
of
it
it
is
at
the
same
time
a
session
beer
and
a
fine
craft
beer
everyone
reading
this
should
try
the
raftman
if
not
bm
me
and
i
will
take
it
off
of
your
hands
this
is
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
d
the
light
yet
rich
flavor
makes
this
a
must
drink
the
whiskey
malt
gives
it
such
a
unique
flavor
must
try
will
definitely
drink
again
a
very
smoothdrinking
beer
altogether
id
like
to
review
it
again
and
take
better
notes
as
there
was
some
stuff
i
wasnt
recognizing
in
the
aroma
taste
raftman
ale
is
much
less
robust
and
thinner
than
other
unibroue
beers
i
have
had
very
east
to
drink
ale
tastes
of
some
dried
apricot
and
grainy
toasty
malt
mild
smoke
mouthfeel
is
super
fizzy
and
grainy
d
an
excellent
easy
drinking
ale
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
pours
a
nice
orangey
amber
with
a
great
initial
head
about
3
fingers
worth
after
an
easy
pour
that
settles
down
to
a
medium
cap
no
lacing
very
light
aromas
of
some
pale
malt
a
touch
of
sweet
banana
from
some
yeast
esters
a
bit
of
wood
and
the
tiniest
bit
of
whiskey
the
whiskey
taste
very
slowly
comes
out
in
the
flavor
on
the
back
end
after
some
more
sweet
banana
and
fairly
firm
cookielike
malt
somewhat
thin
like
many
of
the
unibroue
beers
and
quite
carbonated
the
light
sweetness
firm
malt
soem
minerality
and
hint
of
whiskey
blend
well
this
is
pleasant
and
a
nice
sipper
for
the
porch
in
early
spring
eric
dmoderate
drinkabiltiy
its
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
all
that
remarkable
especially
when
compared
to
the
other
offerings
ive
had
from
unibroue
future
outlook
this
was
part
of
a
minimix
pack
from
unibroue
as
all
of
their
offerings
seem
to
be
quite
good
i
can
easily
see
getting
this
again
in
a
similar
package
purchase
d
very
high
i
dont
usually
like
belgians
but
this
one
was
very
nice
maybe
im
learnig
to
respect
the
style
more
or
maybe
this
one
was
just
good
i
dont
know
where
to
start
the
color
was
a
hazy
medium
to
dark
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
not
much
foam
and
no
lace
what
so
ever
the
smell
had
a
hint
of
spice
carbination
and
no
much
else
the
taste
had
way
to
much
carbination
so
much
that
it
kind
of
masked
any
spice
or
fruit
taste
that
might
have
been
so
to
much
sour
carbination
not
a
pleasant
after
taste
this
has
to
be
the
worst
of
all
the
unibroue
ale
ive
tasted
12
in
all
fast
moving
foam
in
the
head
big
on
the
pour
then
recedes
across
the
surface
like
waves
on
the
shore
more
yellowbrown
in
color
than
orange
just
about
the
level
of
murkiness
youd
expect
from
the
beer
style
unpretentious
nose
of
caramelchocolate
swirls
cinnamon
buns
and
apricot
peach
fruit
and
suggestion
of
banana
the
lemon
citrus
semiconfectionary
gains
steam
with
clove
and
allspice
scents
mediumbodied
while
predictably
smooth
and
creamy
theres
not
much
verve
nor
intensity
to
it
the
clove
cinnamon
spice
is
there
the
banana
apricot
apple
fruit
same
theres
even
more
thrust
to
the
lemon
orange
citrus
but
it
doesnt
come
together
into
a
meaningful
whole
the
carbonation
dulls
it
as
well
light
white
pepper
and
tea
leaf
flavors
help
unfortunately
average
d
i
actually
found
this
on
a
whim
and
picked
it
up
without
ever
seeing
this
brand
in
all
my
years
of
drinking
good
beer
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
will
again
in
the
future
a
great
take
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
good
job
unibroue
i
had
this
on
tap
at
cest
what
in
toronto
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
dark
orange
and
murky
with
a
thick
white
frothy
head
the
smell
was
easy
to
peg
as
unibroue
with
the
characteristic
yeasty
esters
but
a
grassy
or
musky
peatiness
was
there
as
well
unique
to
the
other
unibroue
beers
i
got
these
flavors
in
the
taste
as
well
a
little
mysterious
but
very
tasty
the
body
is
thick
and
full
very
filling
i
looked
for
a
long
time
before
finding
this
and
while
the
hunt
was
more
fun
than
the
kill
this
is
still
a
worthwhile
beer
drank
from
a
bottled
beer
poured
into
a
glass
the
only
negative
came
as
i
was
pouring
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
and
the
head
errupted
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
color
was
a
very
good
amber
while
the
smell
wasnt
really
distinct
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
with
a
slight
but
pleasant
spiced
and
smoky
taste
one
of
the
best
bpa
ive
had
in
a
while
and
would
definately
drink
again
mouth
tastes
like
a
regular
bpa
with
a
subtle
smokiness
same
esters
as
in
the
aroma
with
some
coriander
and
a
wisp
of
smoke
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
needs
to
breathe
and
effervesce
for
a
while
before
it
achieves
any
sort
of
drinkability
decently
dry
recommended
all
in
all
a
pleasant
drink
i
would
have
welcomed
a
bit
more
of
the
smokey
character
but
its
definitely
well
executed
and
deliciously
interesting
i
could
drink
a
few
more
had
i
any
more
left
definitely
worth
a
try
maybe
underrated
among
the
unibroue
brews
but
this
one
ranks
pretty
high
on
my
list
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
it
is
complex
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
of
it
nice
to
see
a
lighter
version
of
the
more
robust
ales
from
unibroue
yet
i
think
id
rather
have
a
single
la
fin
du
monde
than
two
of
these
great
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
drinkability
d
drinkable
one
after
another
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
those
who
love
your
big
belgian
beers
its
got
that
big
flavorful
taste
but
a
low
abv
so
you
can
drink
these
all
night
d
aside
from
some
mouthfeel
problems
this
is
a
pretty
good
ale
i
liked
the
addition
of
the
smoked
whiskey
malt
the
flavour
really
enhanced
what
could
have
a
been
a
pedestrian
effort
nice
hybrid
raftman
pours
a
fizzy
clear
amber
with
a
diminishing
offwhite
head
that
leaves
fair
lacing
the
smell
is
fruity
with
apples
and
spicy
with
nutmeg
cloves
and
pepper
the
flavor
is
earthy
and
sweetly
doughy
while
remaining
light
and
very
lively
on
the
palate
there
are
some
subtle
smoky
notes
lingering
throughout
the
beer
that
i
cant
really
pin
down
there
is
a
light
metallic
note
on
the
finish
but
its
unobtrusive
and
overshadowed
by
a
slight
pucker
of
wellcrafted
bitterness
raftman
is
my
favorite
light
unibroue
beer
at
the
moment
and
probably
my
third
favorite
of
their
normal
rotation
i
am
not
just
being
kind
when
i
say
it
is
unique
its
a
one
of
a
kind
and
typical
of
a
belgian
it
will
put
hair
on
your
chest
actually
i
think
this
one
and
lots
of
other
belgians
will
actually
cultivate
hair
all
over
but
drink
it
dont
rub
it
in
one
of
my
first
unibroue
beers
i
didnt
love
pours
a
murky
tannishorange
with
thick
fluffy
head
good
retention
and
lacing
but
kinda
has
this
swamp
water
look
to
it
just
weird
smell
is
stong
of
yeast
and
bread
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
which
i
was
very
glad
to
have
in
there
a
bit
of
sweet
fruit
apple
as
well
taset
wa
a
little
bland
if
you
ask
me
perhaps
im
comparing
it
to
their
other
offerings
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
dry
malt
and
biscuit
yeast
some
fruits
and
some
grass
are
all
present
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
i
though
but
due
to
extremely
low
carbonation
it
just
seems
a
little
flat
overall
not
bad
but
one
of
my
least
favorite
unibroue
offerings
a
very
good
tasting
beer
very
heavily
carbonated
and
an
interestingsweet
aftertaste
but
the
taste
is
what
makes
it
great
a
nice
woodsy
type
of
taste
i
kind
of
want
to
say
it
is
almost
manly
tasting
hardy
in
a
way
and
its
all
well
balanced
and
goes
down
smooth
not
the
best
unibroue
ive
had
but
an
above
average
beer
for
sure
flavor
is
wonderful
starts
with
rich
spice
and
bleeds
into
some
almost
smoked
and
woody
tones
slightly
yeasty
with
hints
of
white
pepper
whiskey
malts
are
obvious
and
and
great
dimensions
a
rich
balance
with
hints
of
soft
vanilla
and
whisps
of
toffee
supercarbonatedits
fun
to
watch
in
the
glass
in
the
mouth
light
bodied
but
rich
flavors
mingle
and
end
with
a
crisp
dryness
that
says
yes
ill
have
another
and
yes
ill
have
another

abv
this
is
easily
a
beer
to
have
several
of
pours
a
dark
cloudy
golden
brown
color
with
a
huge
foamy
head
aroma
consists
of
light
fruit
such
as
apple
pear
and
banana
as
well
as
a
slight
maltiness
this
beer
has
an
interesting
mix
of
crisp
light
fruit
and
whiskey
malts
carbonated
with
crisp
center
and
dry
whiskeylike
finish
d
i
love
unibroue
and
this
is
another
of
their
great
beers
strange
brew
this
after
checking
out
scores
from
others
on
here
i
reckon
this
is
either
a
dud
batch
or
it
has
been
mistreated
on
the
trip
over
the
tang
on
the
finish
just
aint
right
good
beer
but
lacking
serious

500th
review
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
golden
almost
amber
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
quickly
settled
into
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
there
is
some
apple
skin
canned
pineapple
juice
light
belgian
yeast
funk
and
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
with
appropriate
candi
sugar
sweetness
the
yeast
flavors
are
subdued
but
i
get
a
mild
tropical
fruitiness
pineapple
touch
of
coriander
and
pepper
there
a
stale
hop
presence
to
round
out
the
brew
the
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
and
finishes
dry
a
unibroue
brew
that
is
unique
from
their
other
offerings
this
beer
knows
its
place
and
is
a
good
compliment
to
the
unibroue
lineup
great
beer
for
somebody
that
wants
a
nice
light
belgian
style
beer
without
a
lot
of
alcohol
overall
i
am
a
bit
mixed
there
seems
to
be
subtle
flavours
that
i
wasnt
able
to
pick
out
i
might
have
to
pick
up
another
for
tasting
d
very
very
good
quite
enjoyablesessionable
the
body
is
light
and
dry
with
a
variety
of
light
fruit
yeast
based
flavors
toasty
with
some
pepper
and
smoke
touches
of
metallic
graininess
but
not
much
peachy
esters
and
lemony
finish
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
verdict
well
crafted
and
lighter
than
other
unibroue
beers
ive
had
drinkable
from
the
tap
never
seen
it
in
bottles
thanks
to
matt
for
the
sample
at
first
the
taste
wasnt
something
i
saw
myself
enjoying
i
even
contimplated
not
finishing
the
glass
but
after
a
few
sips
you
sink
right
in
and
although
its
definately
not
a
session
beer
its
one
easily
enjoyed
as
a
taster
d
not
my
cup
of
beer
and
would
highly
recommend
most
of
unibroues
other
beers
over
this
one
faint
smoky
malt
flavor
rich
texture
to
the
mouthfeel
quite

pazzos
pizza
pub
lexington
ky
a
pint
night
offering
dont
think
this
beer
is
actually
belgian
pale
but
its
quite
a
good
beer
no
matter
the
style
a
very
rusty
colored
lightly
viscous
pour
delivers
a
dainty
head
retention
and
light
creamy
carbonation
which
creame
resists
fading
throughout
moderate
aromas
of
complex
malts
aged
hops
fruitiness
spicy
esters
and
a
vineous
peatey
light
smoke
musky
scent
sets
the
tone
a
strong
scent
of
metal
and
rust
accompanies
overripe
fruits
of
peaches
dates
figs
grapes
pears
apricots
and
mangos
flavors
hit
on
these
same
notes
but
apply
emphasis
to
a
woodsy
musty
character
a
yeasty
bready
flavor
and
texture
and
strong
spicy
fruity
esters
the
textue
is
far
lighter
than
the
aroamas
and
flavors
suggest
more
witbierlike
than
belgian
pale
very
creamy
textured
with
light
powdery
cooling
sensation
alcohols
remain
light
throughout
waters
a
bit
toward
the
end
but
reamins
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
and
rather
smooth
despite
the
carbonation
im
not
sure
id
want
this
all
the
time
but
it
seems
pretty
sessionable
easy
to
share
and
interesting
enough
to
be
worth
shaking
things
up
reach
for
a
bottle
if
you
find
one
drinkability
overall
a
very
fine
tasting
brew
was
expecting
much
more
smoke
or
super
burnt
malt
characteristics
though
i
believe
this
used
to
be
listed
under
the
smoked
beer
catagory
another
great
beer
from
unibroue
a
very
good
looking
beer
a
light
hazy
orangebrown
colour
the
head
is
not
that
thick
but
it
does
last
for
the
entirety
of
the
beer
malt
and
smokiness
on
the
nose
although
the
smokiness
is
subtle
but
more
evident
on
the
palate
the
yeast
character
that
i
love
so
much
is
not
as
pronounced
as
it
is
in
a
maudite
or
a
fin
du

but
its
still
there
none

less
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
while
surfing
the
information
beer
way
aka
ba
overall
another
solid
brew
from
unibroue
this
brewery
cannot
be
complimented
enough
for
the
quality
and
craftsmanship
of
their
amazing
lineup
of
spectacular
beers
tres
bien
taste
is
at
first
of
alcohol
malt
that
is
quite
harsh
followed
by
citrus
flavours
spicness
coriander
etc
which
ends
in
a
shy
hoppy
finish
d
not
impressed
at
all
really
lacks
flavour
and
the
most
positive
aspect
i
can
draw
from
the
beer
is
the
aftertaste
a
disappointment
overall
impression
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
my
least
favorite
unibroue
so
far
d
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
better
beers
out
there
in
this
style
d
a
bit
thin
in
my
opinion
to
be
a
belgian
pale
the
body
didnt
have
the
normal
yeasty
thickness
to
it
not
horrible
just
not
impressive
easy
to
drink
solid
enough
beer
but
i
have
enjoyed
others
in
the
style
a
little
more
althought
i
really
enjoyed
the
smoky
characteristics
of
this
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
session
but
i
would
rather
have
almost
any
of
the
unibroue
brews
i
used
to
find
this
beer
rather
enjoyable
because
of
the
pronounced
whiskey
in
the
flavour
but
after
revisiting
recently
those
setiments
were
lost
slightly
spicy
malty
and
you
do
taste
some
whiskey
malt
but
not
as
refined
as
it
should
be
in
fact
any
one
who
knows
their
whiskey
would
be
disapointed
im
sure
the
focus
on
whiskey
also
distracts
from
a
weak
hop
job
and
overall
fuzzy
make
up
of
the
beers
body
was
not
impressed
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
copper
with
a
rather
small
and
rather
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
smell
is
yeasty
with
come
citrus
and
light
fruits
alongside
a
woody
note
and
some
spices
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
taste
is
full
and
robust
with
plenty
of
malts
a
bit
of
pepper
and
yeast
sits
next
to
the
bright
fruitiness
and
mild
grainy
flavour
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
metallic
mouthfeel
is
good
abundant
carbonation
and
plenty
of
body
and
drinkability
is
solid
another
nice
belgian
offering
from
unibroue
i
never
expected
anything
less
the
flavour
started
smoky
before
turning
yeasty
and
sweet
in
the
middle
and
finishing
woody

think
oak
i
didnt
pick
up
a
ton
of
complexity
but
it
was
pleasant
nevertheless
while
the
complexity
is
huge
this
certainly
isnt
the
most
intense
of
belgians
or
smoke
ales
for
that
matter
such
a
blend
of
flavor
and
accessibility
makes
this
a
great
crossover
beer
but
even
full
on
beer
maniacs
should
find
enough
goodness
here
to
keep
themselves
happy
d
a
good
ale
moderate
abv
and
balanced
flavour
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
one
of
the
best
unibroues
for
everyday
drinking
md
softlycarbonated
in
texture
the
body
is
just
moderate
and
the
flavour
definitely
evolves
with
that
bit
of
smokiness
melted
in
the
overall
flavour
just
nicely
intriguingly
the
smokiness
manifests
itself
more
in
line
with
smoked
fruits
than
smoked
malts
at
least
for
me
my
patience
pays
off
as
the
initially
timid
smokiness
gradually
tunes
up
both
on
the
aroma
and
the
palate
and
the
finishing
touch
of
smokiness
is
really
rounded
and
nice
executed
in
a
totally
different
way
than
bambergs
smoked
beer
the
more
i
sip
it
the
more
i
like
it
a
little
quiet
beer
worth
probing
with
patience
an
amazingly
refreshing
drinkable
simple
yet
elegant
and
complex
beer
its
hard
to
stop
at
just
one
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
a
scotch
drinker
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
due
to
its
wonderful
whiskey
malt
character
it
would
also
make
a
damn
fine
session
brew
or
even
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
the
realm
of
craft
beer

its

its

brew
i

the
label
to

it

when
i

it
i

it

song
together
the
smokiness
is
very
subdued
and
allows
the
base
beer
to
come
through
while
still
reminding
me
this
is
a
smoked
beer
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
i
am
so
sad
that
this
beer
is
not
sold
around
here
anymore
i
would
try
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
beer
is
good
happy
stale
beering
edit
after
picking
the
fairly
considerable
amount
of
yeast
a
flashlight
could
barely
shine
through
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
up
of
the
bottom
and
pouring
the
remnants
into
the
remainder
of
the
beer
i
was
treated
to
a
much
yeastier
duh
version
of
the
beer
far
more
dry
but
clinging
on
to
its
better
qualities
aroma
is
muted
by
the
fogginess
of
the
yeast
id
say
its
best
served
wo
the
yeast
that
aroma
was
just
top
notch
and
made
every
dive
into
the
beer
that
much
more
enjoyable
brown
341
ml
bottle
with
freshness
date
on
rear
label
this
was
a
very
crisp
and
light
bodied
beer
initially
some
smokiness
yeast
toasted
flavour
then
a
peppery
taste
and
some
spices
afterwards
some
plum
and
more
tartness
mouthfeel
was
light
overall
and
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
first
of
all
i
am
not
sure
if
i
had
a
bottle
that
was
on
crack
or
not
but
when
i
opened
this
undisturbed
bottle
it
came
out
flowing
with
a
vengance
it
literrally
flowed
over
for
a
good
minute
and
a
half
the
overall
appearance
was
very
nice
with
a
pretty
hazy
apple
cider
appearance
the
head
was
fantastic
at
first
but
then
fizzled
to
a
film
the
smell
was
wonderful
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
smokey
aroma
the
taste
gave
off
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
roasted
flavor
it
almost
gives
off
a
fruity
smokness
this
was
the
first
smoked
beer
that
i
have
sampled
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
once
again
impressed
with
unibroue
the
only
thing
that
would
been
topped
this
off
would
be
a
little
less
flat
taste
but
that
could
have
been
due
to
the
bottle
in
review
dark
blond
almost
amber
color
with
a
small
frothy
head
smells
ever
so
peculiar
different
than
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
smelled
you
can
easily
detect
the
smokiness
and
whisky
malts
that
are
present
the
taste
is
smoky
and
fruity
that
ever
popular
unibroue
yeast
a
very
nice
light
beer
from
unibroue
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
head
that
fades
quickly
and
sleep
at
the
top
of
the
beer
for
the
ride
smells
woodsy
with
touches
of
hops
yeast
and
roasted
grains
all
mellow
and
mild
aromas
this
is
the
smoothest
smoked
beer
ive
ever
had
mellow
woodsy
flavors
remind
of
the
forests
of
ontario
good
kick
of
unibroue
yeast
and
even
a
touch
of
hops
ill
definitely
be
having
another
one
hazy
peachygold
in
hue
there
is
a
coppery
hint
as
well
especially
when
held
to
a
light
the
head
was
white
in
color
and
a
finger
in
height
at
the
zenith
the
head
retention
was
fair
after
a
moment
or
so
it
slithered
to
a
fizzy
cap
and
then
a
frail
collar
there
is
no
lacing
odd
which
is
disappointing
still
overall
the
appearance
is
attractive
the
nose
is
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
also
the
aroma
is
distinctively
belgium
with
lots
of
yeasty
complexities
coming
through
vanilla
hints
of
fruit
like
oranges
peaches
and
something
tropical
candied
sugar
at
the
back
is
a
suggestion
of
whiskey
and
peat
these
smells
are
very
faint
actually
the
fruitiness
is
frail
too
no
smokiness
the
nose
is
boring
i
like
what
i
smell
but
what
is
it
saying
speak
up
there
is
no
invitation
to
drink
ill
be
rude
and
take
a
sip
anyway
yum
there
are
the
smoky
flavors
on
the
palate
upfront
are
the
characteristics
of
many
belgian
ales
there
are
flavors
of
candied
sugar
vanilla
fruit
apples
peaches
oranges
mainly
with
a
hint
of
something
tropical
maltiness
sweetness
that
is
pleasantly
firm
and
pepper
in
the
middle
the
smokey
characteristics
are
found
lightly
meaty
fatty
bacon
sausage
wood
pure
smoke
and
some
whiskey
flavors
alcohol
heat
follows
more
pepper
notes
too
the
finish
is
very
carbonated
which
does
add
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
good
mix
of
fatty
meat
smoke
and
the
skeleton
of
a
light
belgium
ale
i
am
impressed
at
the
complexities
of
a
beer
with
such
a
small
abv
it
is
very
light
drinking
medium
in
body
light
on
the
tongue
but
the
carbonation
is
very
big
and
lively
this
adds
great
detail
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
i
could
really
dig
this
in
the
summer
heat
or
even
a
cool
winter
evening
id
love
to
drink
the
more
often
of
course
it
is
not
available
in
nebraska
and
i
have
not
seen
it
in
kc
i
bought
my
750ml
bottle
in
burnsville
mn
well
worth
a
quaff
overall
superb
sampled
4204
raftman
poured
ever
so
beautifully
with
as
much
head
as
you
wish
to
pour
foamy
consistent
and
thick
the
massive
white
head
churns
like
butter
or
cream
in
the
glass
making
a
noticeable
crackle
sound
patchy
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
offruby
with
hints
of
orange
and
it
sometimes
has
the
appearance
of
tomatojuice
but
less
red
besides
typical
unibroue
spice
and
yeast
smells
there
is
a
very
flowery
very
herbal
and
sweet
aroma
smelling
delicately
like
some
whisky
even
managing
to
give
wooden
oak
aromas
every
occasional
sniff
i
smell
a
somewhat
unnatural
smellsolventlike
rubbery
plastic
hard
to
describe
nectarines
plums
sour
candy
delicate
sweet
malt
oak
taste
is
much
of
the
same
and
this
is
probably
the
least
vigorous
unibroue
i
have
tasted
for
mouthfeelit
is
very
smooth
comparatively
lowcarbonated
and
easy
to
drink
quickly
compared
to
most
unibroue
products
not
that
i
would
drink
this
quickly
but
it
goes
down
with
surprising
swiftness
of
course
the
beer
is
only
5
5
definite
wood
tastes
with
sweet
malt
yeasty
tones
and
a
sensational
aftertaste
of
light
malt
fruity
esters
fresh
pine
needles
and
floral
perfumy
notes
overall
though
i
wish
they
would
give
the
beer
more
sweet
whisky
malt
character
because
mostly
what
i
sense
is
the
yeasty
taste
which
seems
to
overpower
most
of
the
other
flavours
this
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
unibroue
i
have
had
thus
far
due
to
low
gravity
and
lighter
mouthfeel
conclusion
this
is
another
great
product
but
one
which
could
probably
improve
from
toning
down
the
yeast
or
stepping
up
the
whisky
malt
i
avoided
this
beer
for
a
while
as
i
thought
it
was
a
strongly
smoked
beer
like
a
rauch
brau
i
like
a
scotch
ale
that
uses
lightly
peat
smoked
malts
i
wasnt
ready
for
what
i
found
in
this
raftman
i
like
it
as
probably
the
most
drinkable
unibroue
offering
next
to
their
blanche
poured
a
very
hazy
light
gold
with
a
medium
puffy
cap
odor
was
subdued
but
interesting
mustybready
slight
accent
of
spice
started
mild
then
builds
to
a
silky
mouthfeel
accented
by
malt
body
slight
wisps
of
smoke
like
cooking
toast
slight
hop
citrus
tastes
then
a
cleaner
dry
finish
with
an
understated
malty
aftertaste
a
decent
very
drinkable
beer
not
a
deeply
smoled
malt
beer
that
pounds
your
olfactory
senses
a
musty
malty
beer
better
served
cool
than
cold
had
this
on
tap
at
a
pizza
place
on
st
denis
in
montreal
back
in
april
most
nonsmokey
smoked
beer
ive
ever
encountered
pour
was
a
very
cloudy
tangerine
color
white
a
stiff
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
aroma
is
all
wheat
beer
and
yeast
taste
is
alos
very
wheat
beer
like
your
standard
banana
and
clove
encounter
my
question
was
wheres
the
smoke
not
bad
just
not
smokey
at
all
the
taste
was
smooth
malty
slightly
bitter
not
as
smoky
as
the
aroma
implied
and
very
restrained
not
too
bad
but
not
spectacular
and
not
as
drinkable
as
one
would
hope
all
in
all
it
promises
something
but
is
not
able
to
live
up
to
it
the
body
is
not
harmonic
and
balanced
and
the
promised
whiskey
malt
taste
is
much
to
discrete
compared
to
eg
french
whiskey
malt
beer
adelscott
or
the
german
highlander
i
dont
detect
the
smoke
promised
on
the
bottle
this
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
malt
characteristic
present
and
a
hint
of
citrus
on
the
tongue
fruit
character
builds
throughout
as
the
beer
warms
on
the
tongue
and
is
carried
to
the
throat
by
an
overwhelming
carbonated
presence
had
a
really
hard
time
to
get
a
handle
on
this
beer
poured
to
a
very
distinctive
orange
colour
maybe
even
a
very
deep
yellow
head
was
a
very
classical
unibroue
style
hard
charging
in
the
beginning
followed
by
a
just
as
hard
retreat
i
waited
patiently
for
seven
minutes
for
this
beer
to
reveal
it
smokiness
but
it
fell
well
short
the
slight
waft
of
whiskey
malt
beer
is
brewed
in
sam
bronfman
territory
was
overshadowed
by
the
fruit
swril
of
apples
and
pears
that
lightened
the
5
5
abv
a
very
capable
sipping
beer
that
should
be
nurtured
still
could
not
find
any
hint
of
smoke
in
your
mouth
my
great
expectations
were
quelled
to
a
degree
the
taste
is
full
and
impressive
you
can
definitely
taste
the
smokiness
but
it
is
much
more
balanced
than
the
german
rauchbiers
a
good
thing
to
me
there
is
a
strong
malt
base
and
nice
hoppy
and
fruity
flavours
this
beer
is
definitely
a
keeper
the
smoke
isnt
overpowering
unibroue
must
be
the
best
brewery
in
canada
and
this
beer
is
worthy
of
its
name
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
everything
about
this
beer
is
very
gentle
and
subtle
the
moutfeel
is
light
but
the
substance
of
this
beer
is
not
theres
a
good
deal
going
on
here
in
terms
of
flavor
and
theyre
wonderfully
blended
together
very
drinkable
and
complex
beer
a
good
beer
to
try
very
pleased
with
this
i
tried
raftman
at
the
fourquet
fourchette
in
chambly
quebec
and
it
was
very
interesting
the
20oz
was
poured
out
of
a
tap
and
it
was
crisp
the
appearance
was
a
nice
hazy
colour
with
a
creamy
top
the
smell
was
probably
the
best
characteristic
sweet
and
spicy
the
taste
was
decent
at
first
it
bordered
on
bland
however
you
tasted
the
acute
spicyness
on
the
aftertaste
especially
on
the
back
on
your
tongue
mouthfeel
was
average
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
and
the
raftman
compliments
food
very
well
especially
a
sunday
brunch
combo
of
veal
sausages
and
canadian
bacon
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
get
much
smoke
out
of
it
there
was
some
peat
in
the
aroma
of
this
hazy
golden
ale
but
i
wanted
much
more
it
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
slight
smokiness
it
is
very
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
i
find
it
hard
to
stop
drinking
even
though
i
wished
it
was
smokier
i
had
this
beer
cool
because
i
had
only
had
a
limited
time
to
refrigerate
it
its
a
dark
amber
with
a
bubbly
head
that
lasted
a
short
while
smelled
kind
of
like
spices
and
tasted
similar
as
well
as
some
sweetness
maybe
a
little
to
warm
because
i
hadnt
refrigerated
it
long
enough
however
it
still
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
not
too
much
carbonation
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
taste
is
mild
no
one
flavor
overwhelms
the
lightly
smoked
flavor
comes
through
while
a
hint
of
a
whiskeylike
flavor
follows
right
after
this
taste
characterizes
this
beer
completely
and
is
so
even
a
taste
that
it
literally
tastes
as
the
label
describes
which
not
all
beers
can
claim
a
good
solid
beer
for
the
smoked
category
and
has
what
i
would
say
a
slightly
higher
drinkability
than
other
smoked
ales
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
big
white
head
which
fades
quicker
than
expected
smokey
sweet
if
there
is
such
a
thing
unusual
flavor
but
im
not
so
sure
im
digging
that
whisky
flavor
that
is
in
there
there
is
a
touch
of
fruity
in
there
too
hops
come
along
near
the
end
but
are
quite
subtile
goes
down
smooth
an
interesting
ale
from
unibroue
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
a
nice
offering
from
unibroue
the
whisky
malt
makes
this
a
very
scotchishscotch
ale
taste
and
a
good
example
at
that
quite
good
and
probably
would
have
this
again
an
offgolden
color
with
thick
creamy
head
aromas
of
spicy
yeastbananaand
cloves
with
a
touch
of
whiskey
to
it
the
body
is
light
to
medium
that
starts
caramel
with
some
clove
and
yeast
somewhat
hefeweizen
like
in
flavor
with
some
vanilla
that
finishes
lightly
sweet
im
rather
ambivalent
about
this
brew
nice
but
they
do
others
much
nicer
if
you
like
whisky
or
scotch
as
well
as
beer
then
its
an
interesting
and
purposeful
cocktail
of
the
two
original
and
unique
refreshing
evening
drink
swirl
it
and
fizz
settles
to
a
nice
orangebrown
color
tastes
like
a
great
summer
beer
to
me
and
as
such
seems
like
it
needs
to
be
fresh
this
beer
pours
to
a
nice
light
golden
color
but
is
fairly
hazy
it
has
a
medium
head
with
tiny
bubbles
that
eventually
settle
to
a
nice
thin
rim
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
the
largest
hop
aroma
i
have
noticed
from
the
unibroue
beers
slightly
sweet
taste
with
almost
a
caramel
flavor
with
a
light
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
drink
overall
another
good
beer
worth
trying
from
unibroue
this
lightorange
beer
has
considerable
haziness
and
a
thin
head
that
quickly
settles
to
tiny
patches
of
bubbles
its
highly
carbonated
and
you
can
see
relatively
large
bubbles
rise
through
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
the
first
smell
that
you
notice
is
a
rough
substantial
yeastiness
underneath
that
theres
a
slight
and
very
pleasant
applelike
estery
aroma
its
really
enjoyable
slight
peppery
and
smoky
taste
in
the
midtaste
and
a
mild
sweetness
up
front
at
times
it
seems
just
a
little
sour
light
mouthfeel
but
not
what
id
call
thin
and
watery
its
very
drinkable
fun
uncommon
and
quite
good
drinkability
wow
this
is
pretty
nice
a
very
different
offering
from
unibroue
especially
when
compared
to
its
siblings
quite
drinkable
i
wish
i
could
find
this
in
my
area
im
not
certain
if
this
is
truly
a
smoked
beer
it
seems
more
like
the
midpoint
on
the
spectrum
between
a
belgian
strong
pale
and
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
drinkability
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
beer
compared
to
other
unibroue
offerings
this
one
is
not
one
of
their
best
medium
brown
color
cloudy
medium
head
slightly
smoky
aroma
lightly
malty
and
somewhat
yeasty
flavors
are
subdued
and
plentiful
smoke
peat
a
little
whisky
some
fruit
and
citrus
nice
milder
tasting
beer
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
a
very
drinkable
beer
well
done
but
not
special
to
my
mind
came
in
a
6
pack
the
first
ive
ever
seen
unibroue
put
out
that
i
found
in
edmonton
poured
from
a
341
ml
brown
bottle
silver
foil
around
neck
with
a
logo
foil
becomes
purple
at
the
cap
appearance
is
that
of
a
chill
hazed
marmalade
hue
decent
carbonation
big
creamy
white
head
that
eventually
settles
down
to
a
frothy
ring
aroma
contains
sweet
fruity
peachesapricots
some
lively
spices
the
slightest
trace
of
grain
flavour
contains
that
fruitiness
as
well
a
faint
hint
of
smoke
a
bit
of
grass
and
flowers
full
refreshing
mouthfeel
this
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
i
think
ive
found
a
new
favorite
feels
like
there
is
a
party
going
on
in
my
mouth
and
all
the
cool
kids
were
invited
this
malt
whiskey
ale
is
the
cats
ass
i
paid
a
small
fortune
for
this
6
pack
and
it
was
worth
every
cent
if
this
was
the
reward
at
the
end
of
every
day
then
id
be
a
lumberjack
by
trade
as
well
raftman
is
where
its
at
comments

i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
it
a
whiskey
malt
but
it
was
good
nevertheless
this
is
an
interesting
high
quality
brew
id
like
to
try
it
again
when
its
fresher
than
this
current
bottle
because
i
suspect
that
the
disturbing
caramel
and
candiedapple
notes
im
getting
are
from
the
age
of
the
bottle
i
think
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
quality
fairly
complex
brew
thats
unique
tasty
and
low
enough
abv
to
enjoy
for
an
evening
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
for
max
enjoyment
imo
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
upon
opening
the
bottle
which
had
not
been
disturbed
for
days
in
the
fridge
it
violently
poured
foam
like
an
active
volcano
for
about
20
seconds
when
poured
though
the
carbonation
died
down
some
it
pours
a
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
there
is
almost
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
honey
orange
and
a
hint
of
bourbon
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
more
honey
and
bourbon
coming
through
it
almost
tastes
like
the
sweet
bourbon
glaze
that
the
restaurant
i
work
at
uses
for
pork
chops
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
hops
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
slightly
oily
the
drinkability
is
real
nice
as
this
is
a
smooth
sweet
treat
sort
of
a
lightly
smoked
beer
poured
a
dark
gold
hazy
auburn
colour
with
a
nice
head
smelled
of
peat
moss
and
whiskey
tasted
sort
of
sweet
some
whiskey
flavours
at
the
side
of
the
tongue
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
a
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
pretty
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
smoked
brew
but
i
believe
the
smoke
taste
could
be
more
present
i
would
qualify
this
more
as
a
smoke
brew
for
beginners
still
very
good
beer
with
the
disctinct
yeast
flavor
from
unibroue
but
i
frank
better
brew
from
unibroue
this
is
a
very
unsual
brew
from
unibroue
i
heard
this
was
a
smoked
beer
and
was
afraid
since
the
only
other
smoked
beer
ive
had
aecht
marzen
smoked
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
fortunately
there
was
no
smokiness
in
this
instead
i
tasted
a
definite
whiskey
taste
mixed
with
some
sweet
malts
bready
malts
followed
with
some
spicy
yeast
that
mixed
it
up
well
peppery
spices
were
apparent
in
the
finish
along
with
a
mild
fruit
sensation
the
more
i
drank
of
this
the
better
it
got
tastes
of
sweet
malt
with
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
feel
tingles
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
taste
very
sweet
yet
not
overly
sweet
a
yeasty
middle
that
gives
way
to
the
hops
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
great
great
beer
that
is
different
from
the
norm
and
the
best
unibroue
ive
had
yet
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
medium
head
that
leaves
some
pretty
nice
lacingi
really
liked
the
soft
malty
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
also
pretty
soft
with
a
light
smokiness
to
it
with
a
good
malty
backbone
and
finishes
a
little
fruity
i
think
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
for
the
stylepretty
well
done
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
me
its
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
fantastic
you
could
use
this
for
mouthwash
originally
sampled
on
6
august
2002
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
for
whats
supposed
to
be
a
smoked
beer
i
dont
taste
any
smokiness
in
fact
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beermaybe
its
just
me
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
on
the
tongue
when
i
think
of
a
smoked
beer
i
think
more
of
a
winter
beer
to
me
this
is
definitely
a
summer
brew
best
before
april

2003
color
is
very
cloudy
deep
yellowy
amber
pretty
soild
and
juicy
with
a
two
finger
high
head
of
a
super
creamy
whispy
light
and
tight
ivory
head
very
steady
and
even
leaves
some
large
stringy
lace
at
first
but
starts
to
lose
its
staying
power
after
awhile
smell
is
soft
big
time
soft
sublte
with
a
deepening
character
of
musty
malts
sweetly
rich
a
tad
citrusy
and
some
faint
spice
notes
and
whisky
intreging
mixed
tastes
of
smokeylike
malts
very
subtle
but
rich
and
softly
mellowing
and
warming
some
citrusy
hops
and
mild
fruit
of
peach
apricot
and
lemony
spices
fills
out
through
to
the
finish
with
a
lingering
softness
that
just
begs
you
for
another
swig
one
heck
of
a
interesting
brew
put
together
magnificantly
feel
is
pretty
full
and
textured
lightly
with
a
small
astringency
in
the
middle
leading
to
the
soft
lingering
dryness
of
warmed
ice
cream
pondering
this
beer
is
quite
fun
it
takes
more
then
one
glass
of
it
to
really
appreciate
it
one
excellent
brewed
beer
unibroue
never
stops
the
onslaught
of
interesting
beers
and
this
ranks
up
there
with
some
of
the
finest
magnifique
in
the
mouth
again
the
favourite
word
here
is
soft
smooth
light
and
easy
drinking
happily
this
beer
is
only
5
5
which
means
that
the
drinkability
is
unhampered
so
many
of
its
unibroue
brethren
are
just
too
powerful
to
quaff
in
quantity
drink
less
drink
better
indeed
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
nonetheless
i
thought
the
use
of
whiskey
malt
would
impart
a
little
bit
more
of
its
characteristics
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
cheers
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
figure
this
beer
out
and
maybe
thats
okay
in
this
case
ive
had
different
reactions
every
time
ive
had
it
liking
it
more
each
time
a
most
unusual
ale
unibroue
is
most
adept
at
crafting
unique
beers
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
hazy
apricot
hue
topped
by
an
intially
thick
vanilla
white
head
that
quickly
fizzles
into
a
thin
but
tight
layer
devoid
of
any
lace
waft
of
buttery
caramel
and
woody
oak
hits
the
nose
at
first
then
is
followed
by
a
bright
contrast
of
unibroue
yeasts
signature
ripe
juicy
tropical
fruit
albeit
at
a
diminished
level
compared
to
their
other
brews
curious
impression
of
grilled
passionfruit
topped
with
caramel
syrup
odd
yet
enjoyable
in
aroma
begins
slowly
flavorwise
doughy
flour
like
malt
with
a
delayed
sweetness
intially
in
flavor
lingers
and
is
ensued
by
citric
lightly
acidic
kumkuat
like
fruit
after
a
significant
deliberation
mild
banana
and
peachy
esters
emerge
mid
palate
simulataneously
with
lightly
toffeeish
caramel
malt
character
ends
rather
abruptly
leaving
the
constituitively
expressed
bittersweet
non
descript
hop
bitterness
and
residual
sugar
combination
to
dominate
late
moderate
in
body
once
the
carbonation
dissapates
revealing
a
functionally
smooth
dextrinous
mouthfeel
mellow
finishes
with
mild
must
and
notes
of
candied
citrus
zest
raftman
is
strange
yet
enjoyable
it
becomes
much
more
balanced
and
mellow
as
it
breathes
and
co2
escapes
its
tasty
but
lacks
complexity
my
least
favorite
unibroue
thus
far
best
before
492003
a
light
copper
body
sits
crowned
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
subsides
in
a
few
minutes
aromas
of
malt
citrus
and
whiskey
it
reminded
me
of
when
grandma
would
send
me
down
to
pendergasts
bar
to
fetch
pop
home
for
dinner
strictly
a
beerandashot
kind
of
place
in
the
bronx
i
can
see
where
proust
was
coming
from
taste
is
also
malt
whiskey
citrus
plus
some
caramel
a
smooth
refined
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
adding
a
nice
tang
a
smooth
malty
sweet
finish
with
a
small
citrus
tang
finishes
our
whitewater
excursion
yum
f
drinkability
good
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
sip
when
you
dont
want
something
heavy
and
complex
its
light
and
easygoing
and
lends
itself
well
to
warmer
weather
the
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
for
the
light
taste
the
carbonation
is
very
fine
and
adds
another
dimension
of
refined
texture
to
the
experience
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
although
the
lingering
yeast
component
could
begin
to
wear
on
the
taste
buds
during
a
prolonged
session
but
this
beer
has
a
refreshing
quaity
due
to
the
effervescent
carbonation
and
the
quaffable
abv
i
may
end
up
drinking
this
beer
more
oftan
than
many
of
the
other
unibroue
offerings
simply
becasue
it
tastes
very
good
yet
i
dont
need
to
plan
when
to
have
it
due
to
the
alcohol
content
a
very
solid
offering
this
is
perhaps
the
lightest
of
the
unibroue
brews
that
ive
sampled
it
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
poured
a
hazy
copperorange
color
with
a
medium
bubbly
head
the
high
carbonation
level
that
seemed
to
keep
the
head
alive
the
entire
time
i
was
drinking
it
there
was
a
small
amount
of
whiskey
malt
in
the
aroma
in
addition
to
a
bit
of
spicy
clove
and
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
taste
is
very
enjoyable
theres
a
kick
of
toasted
malt
on
the
initial
taste
followed
by
a
subtle
caramel
and
fruit
sweetness
theres
a
smoky
taste
left
on
the
palate
after
finishing
this
one
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
a
nice
beer
to
dine
with
but
not
a
session
brew
it
is
crisp
with
nice
tingly
carbonation
the
yeast
is
very
well
balanced
with
wheat
and
lots
of
grains
a
citrusy
lemon
flavor
comes
in
just
before
the
yeasty
kick
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
pretty
light
in
body
but
it
does
not
lack
any
flavor
another
good
one
from
unibroue
poured
amber
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
moderate
to
active
carbonation
feels
great
for
this
brew
and
adds
alot
to
the
experience
a
soft
floral
and
grape
aroma
fight
for
attention
tastes
a
bit
thin
and
sweet
but
some
how
it
lingers
for
awhile
raftman
is
very
drinkable
and
is
a
good
buy
at
six
dollars
for
a
25oz
bottle
the
appearance
is
a
golden
orangish
tone
with
a
white
head
along
with
a
solid
amount
of
lace
lining
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
nice
apple
fragrance
along
with
some
nice
esters
that
arise
to
the
nose
very
sweet
flavors
with
the
balancing
bitterness
arising
in
the
finish
very
mild
smooth
and
refreshing
for
unibroue
this
one
is
lighter
in
flavor
than
most
of
their
brews
but
it
is
still
a
very
solid
selection
that
deserves
a
shot
it
dances
on
the
tongue
with
the
high
carbonation
but
overall
a
lighter
to
medium
body
pretty
drinkable
but
the
high
carbonation
would
stop
me
from
wanting
to
consume
too
many
of
these
excellent
beer
from
unibroue
the
head
is
a
nice
light
brown
with
big
bubbles
that
settle
fairly
quickly
the
beer
is
a
deep
golden
to
beige
color
in
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
but
the
smell
and
the
taste
just
hit
you
head
on
no
that
theyre
overly
strong
but
the
whiskey
malt
adds
a
flavor
and
an
aroma
that
are
truly
unique
and
very
noticeable
hints
of
smoke
and
an
applelike
taste
with
definite
overtones
of
whiskey
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
have
too
many
because
the
flavor
can
get
a
little
overwhelming
after
a
few
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
certainly
worth
a
closer
look
and
unlike
the
heavy
alcohol
content
of
all
of
unibroues
other
offerings
this
one
at
5
5
is
pretty
calm
which
makes
it
an
enjoyable
beer
to
have
more
than
one
of
in
any
single
sitting

no

taste
is
very
dry
leaving
you
wanting
to
take
another
drink
to
refresh
i
dont
know
why
i
want
to
describe
the
taste
as
corky
maybe
this
is
a
fault
of
this
particular
bottle
actually
i
think
this
taste
may
be
the
yeast
reminds
me
again
of
a
chimay
doesnt
have
all
the
fruity
tastes
or
lingering
complexity
of
other
unibroue
products
still
not
a
bad
offering
bright

medium

big

right
off
the
bat
with
twinge
of
spices
and
yeast
although
mild
compared
to
unibroues
other
offerings
whiskymalt
and
smokiness
is
certainly
present
but
obscured
by
fizziness
and
belgian
type
yeast
quite
refreshing
and
a
bizarre
combination
of
flavors
that
works
i
am
getting
a
lot
of
wheat
characteristics
not
being
as
awestruck
by
unibroues
popular
beers
as
a
lot
of
people
are
i
was
delightfully
surprised
by
this
i
was
informed
at
the
store
that
this
is
no
longer
available
in
the
us
is
it
a
summer
seasonal
big

with

not
as

as
other
unibroue
offerings
smooth

base
comes
right
at
you
slight
smokecinder
finish
as
the
brew
warms
the
finish
does
also
have
a
slight
touch
of
floral
aftertaste
hazy
bottle
conditioned
amberorange
in
color
with
a
full
dense
white
head
that
drops
but
keeps
a
decent
18
of
foam
and
leaves
some
minor
lace
the
aroma
is
fruity
citrusy
lightly
lemon
and
peach
and
quite
sweetish
candyish
even
with
some
noteable
yeast
character
present
very
welcoming
the
body
is
light
but
enhanced
by
a
very
fine
and
gently
effervescent
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
fuller
appearance
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
sweet
but
backed
by
enough
underlying
bitterness
to
keep
it
anchored
theres
soft
flavors
of
light
dark
fruits
berries
peach
light
citrus
a
sweet
bready
malt
not
unlike
cookie
dough
and
a
light
peppery
spiciness
and
some
woody
vanilla
notes
from
the
yeast
very
nice
it
finishes
semisweet
with
a
lingering
sweet
fruity
malt
note
if
smokiness
is
to
be
found
in
this
beer
its
in
the
finish
and
quite
light
well
brewed
this
would
make
a
great
apertif
or
even
a
nice
afterdinner
drink
paired
with
some
lightly
sweet
dessert
cookies
or
raspberry
sorbet
or
this
would
also
make
a
great
beer
for
a
soft
lightly
breezy
summer
evening
as
the
sun
goes
down
quite
unique
and
very
enjoyable
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
and
throws
out
a
medium
dense
white
head
that
is
well
retained
there
are
some
subdued
belgian
yeast
notes
on
the
nose
as
well
as
a
candy
like
sweetness
the
taste
of
this
almost
reminds
me
of
the
jw
lees
barleywines
except
this
is
a
lot
more
subdued
a
dark
fruit
presence
is
noted
some
yeasty
doughy
characteristics
whiskey
malt
im
not
sure
what
characteristics
whiskey
malt
would
add
but
there
is
something
a
little
unique
about
this
beer
that
i
cant
pinpoint
probably
the
whiskey
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
smokiness
the
body
is
light
to
medium
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinking
another
solid
beer
from
unibroue
edit
this
needs
to
be
expanded
the
smokey
overtones
to
this
are
very
pleasant
im
not
sure
if
the
whiskey
malt
comes
through
with
any
whiskeyish
flavours
but
that
sweet
smokiness
akin
to
a
campfire
burning
sugar
maple
maybe
is
all
the
result
i
need
from
the
malts
the
typical
fantastic
unibroue
mouthfeel
is
present
this
would
work
well
with
old
cheddar
cheese
onion
soup
or
salmon
i
have
friends
for
whom
the
ultimate
drinking
beer
is
the
blanche
de
chambly
for
me
its
raftman
i
could
have
one
after
the
other
of
this
brew
ill
be
buying
this
by
the
case
asap

unibroues
1837
this
one
is
not
alot
better
but
im
starting
at
the
bottom
and
working
up
like
1837
this
one
is
interesting
but
not
great
a
votre
sante
155
really
a
different
ale
looks
and
pours
like
cider
slight
yeast
taste
with
smoky
overtones
zero
carbonation
and
head
really
wierd
after
reading
the
other
reviews
i
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
a
great
session
unibroue
with
alot
of
uniqueness
its
ok
but
had
too
much
in
common
with
the
other
beers
from
unibroue
this
was
ok
though
nice
slightly
smoky
flavours
but
not
well
noticed
based
on
the
reviews
below
i
think
i
might
have
gotten
a
bad
beer
usually
the
unibroue
line
is
quite
good
but
this
beer
was
fairly
boring
for
them
pours
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
clear
golden
maple
color
my
wife
made
me
say
maple
color
tart
fruity
smell
cidery
and
malty
no
apricot
smell
noticed
doesnt
taste
as
interesting
as
it
smells
watery
slightly
malty
sweet
finishes
sweetsour
not
anywhere
near
as
good
as
their
other
offerings
yeah
boy
thats
what
im
talkin
bout
nice
lighter
beer
in
the
unibrew
lineup
i
greatly
appriciate
the
fact
the
whiskey
malt
was
not
over
done
sit
back
and
enjoy
one
or
two
fruity
light
bodied
ale
with
intense
aroma
of
apricots
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
another
in
the
fine
line
of
unibroue
belgian
style
ales
raftman
is
brewed
in
memory
of
the
masters
of
the
forest
who
were
simultaneously
lumberjacks
log
drivers
and
raftsmen
to
commemorate
their
legendary
courage
they
knew
when
it
was
time
how
to
settle
their
differences
and
share
their
joie
de
vivre
around
a
beer
or
a
whisky
an
average
belgian
ipa
not
a
lot
of
aroma
has
a
nice
belgian
yeast
flavor
to
it
about
average
overall
pours
a
light
amber
with
not
a
lot
of
head
the
smell
was
very
subdued
but
had
some
nice
grapefruit
scents
to
it
the
taste
was
a
bit
mellow
throughout
with
some
hop
flavors
on
the
end
but
little
belgian
wheat
or
other
flavors
not
bad
but
i
like
a
lot
of
their
other
beers
more
than
this
one
overall
not
a
bad
beer
my
first

this

12
oz
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hints
of
belgian
flavors
subtle
unique
flavors
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
from
dc
brau
as
a
bros
wrote
complex
this
is
not
one
to
just
knock
back
as
each
sip
peels
back
another
layer
of
flavor
true
upgrade
nice
aromatics
malt
dominant
on
palate
which
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
belgian
pale
the
malt
sweetness
and
yeast
hits
right
away
a
little
bit
of
honey
and
citrus
aroma
heavy
but
went
down
easily
despite
the
7
abv
mouthfeel
a
bit
sticky
for
lack
of
a
better
word
could
have
used
a
tiny
bit
more
hopping
for
balance
i
expect
any
belgianstyle
to
emphasize
the
malt
and
yeast
more
than
the
hops
but
it
was
almost
too
sweet
id
still
buy
it
again
though
thanks
go
to
treyliff
for
this
trade
pours
a
dirty
blonde
color
with
little
to
no
sediment
the
beer
is
cloudy
and
unfiltered
the
aroma
full
of
belgian
candi
sugar
bubblegum
and
clean
alcohol
in
the
taste
brown
sugar
candi
sugar
wild
flower
honey
and
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
kick
a
little
bubblegum
is
there
in
the
flavor
too
medium
bodied
medium
high
carbonation
overall
a
nice
belgian
pale
in
a
can
prost
poured
a
hazy
deep
orangeygold
initially
has
a
creamier
white
head
that
reduces
down
to
slight
presence
around
the
circumference
of
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
yeast
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
has
a
nice
tangyness
to
it
reminiscent
of
the
way
sourdough
tastes
there
are
also
some
subtle
fruit
notes
hiding
in
the
back
theres
a
nice
thickness
to
it
and
its
quite
smooth
a
very
good
belgianstyle
pale
ale
as
some
other
reviewers
have
pointed
out
the
date
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
is
not
helpful
mine
says

so
does
that
mean
drink
by
318
or
born
on
318
i
dont
know
bottom
line
i
was
not
impressed
and
did
not
find
this
beer
enjoyable
in
the
least
bit
come
on
dc
brau
i
know
you
can
do
better
too
thick
carbonation
to
low
sweet
with
some
lime
and
pepper
but
complexity
and
interest
here
on
the
low
end
of
the
scale
i
believe
this
is
my
first
dc
brau
and
im
not
overly
impressed
overall
a
nice
american
take
on
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
summer
slight
tart
as
when
the
beer
started
to
warm
the
fruit
came
out
creamy
mouthfeel
thanks
davetreat
for
the
opportunity
overall
meh
syrupy
candy
malts
hops
are
not
great
ester
profile
swings
too
far
just
all
around
not
so
good
a
very
smooth
bpa
with
tons
of
banana
action
too
bad
i
have
to
end
my
dc
brau
sampling
on
this
one
id
rather
have
passed
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
tight
carbonation
earthy
hops
and
a
prominent
peppery
spice
presence
that
lingers
over
the
bready
yeast
pale
malt
and
light
fruit
notes
into
a
dry
finish
thankfully
this
beer
tastes
more
interesting
than
it
smells
but
the
yeast
presence
is
a
bit
too
strong
for
my
preference
and
it
feels
more
like
a
wheatwitbier
than
anything
else
some
zesty
coriander
and
grassy
piney
hops
followed
by
sourdough
bread
bubblegum
and
lemon
zest
slightly
tart
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
a
bit
watered
down
and
pedestrian
as
it
warms
the
estery
light
fruit
notes
start
to
show
with
hints
of
apple
pear
and
raisin
still
this
beer
isnt
very
complex
or
interesting
not
bad
by
any
means
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
im
glad
that
i
only
bought
a
single
can
o
the
yeast
and
the
malt
dominate
this
one
its
very
different
than
almost
all
of
the
bpas
i
have
had
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
its
just
different
i
probably
would
not
get
it
again
but
i
didnt
hate
it
verdict
a
pretty
poor
attempt
at
a
belgian
pale
ale
from
dc
brau
it
has
bad
balance
lots
of
unpleasantries
and
has
few
redeeming
qualities
while
i
enjoy
their
hoppy
beers
i
might
be
staying
away
from
their
belgian
beers
until
further
notice
o
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
i
dig
the
sourness
this
is
a
tough
style
to
do
well
especially
given
the
availability
of
so
many
belgian
masters
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
this
one
needs
more
work
poured
a
cloudy
yellowish
gold
with
two
finger
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
and
left
a
lace
ring
a
rather
airy
nondescript
aroma
but
i
do
pick
up
some
spice
and
grain
and
touches
of
bready
malt
and
citric
the
yeastiness
in
this
beer
helps
make
it
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
without
becoming
watery
but
i
found
that
the
sweet
malts
are
minimal
at
best
dont
expect
alot
of
candi
sugar
or
tropical
fruit
sweetness
or
caramel
and
that
the
hops
and
fruit
flavors
mostly
give
off
a
slightly
bitter
or
acidic
crisp
bite
and
offer
up
some
decent
citric
notes
but
not
too
much
else
decent
balance
so
its
not
overly
sharp
or
acidic
but
just
one
of
those
beers
that
seems
watered
down
for
more
mainstream
consumption
and
it
was
alright
but
not
worth
having
again
at
yeast
we
have
our
health
not
a
game
changing
by
any
means
and
as
someone
said
the
lack
of
bottle
conditioning
really
harms
the
impact
of
this
beer
but
dont
let
that
turn
you
away
its
a
great
session
beer
thats
perfect
for
a
hot
day
or
a
bbq
o
not
great
unfortunately
theres
little
here
to
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
seconds
all
this
does
is
confirm
my
skepticism
toward
canned
belgianstyle
ales
without
bottle
conditioning
what
do
you
have
not
much
really
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
1
finger
of
head
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
ever
so
slightly
with
macro
notes
corn
i
guess
taste
is
simple
belgian
yeast
that
has
been
dumbed
down
its
so
subtle
meh
its
ok
easy
to
drink
and
normal
meh
there
is
nothing
amazing
about
this
brew
its
just
a
super
sessionable
bpa
nice
hazy
honey
colored
ale
with
a
solid
sheet
of
fine
whites
atop
smells
like
grain
sweet
grain
pears
flowers
some
grass
and
a
little
biscuit
smells
fresh
i
dig
that
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
a
good
floral
character
with
some
juicy
fruit
some
grain
and
dough
like
the
flavor
too
a
little
fuller
bodied
than
id
dig
but
with
the
softened
carbonation
it
has
a
nice
feel
overall
and
an
unobtrusive
finish
nice
beer
surprised
and
satisfied
aroma
is
yeast
driven
estery
pearbanana
and
spicy
white
pepper
similar
flavors
some
banana
and
pear
sweetness
dry
spice
in
the
middle
that
lingers
long
into
the
aftertaste
with
some
light
residual
bitterness
creamy
feel
with
ample
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
smooth
overall
a
nice
bpa
pretty
flavorful
and
drinkable
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
refreshing
nice
flavor
and
very
drinkable
not
sure
if
it
was
the
execution
or
just
an
odd
collection
of
ingredients
but
this
one
didnt
really
mesh
the
flavors
well
too
many
distinct
flavors
popping
out
on
their
own
seemingly
out
of
place
rather
than
molding
together
to
form
a
nice
coherent
flavor
profile
far
from
awful
but
probably
not
something
id
seek
out
again
got
this
as
a
free
sample
from
the
boss
score
serving
it
chilled
poured
this
one
in
my
maudite
tulip
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
the
tell
tale
clove
banana
biscuit
pear
taste
had
a
great
tartness
that
really
appealed
to
me
it
was
smooth
and
really
drinkable
notes
of
tart
cherries
biscuit
yeast
and
grass
overall
a
nicebelgian
that
has
a
taste
profile
in
between
that
of
a
belgian
session
and
a
triple
quite
tasty
o
i
tend
to
prefer
a
drier
bpa
a
fine
beer
but
not
a
favorite
from
the

although
im
not
crazy
about

very
light
and
springish
refreshing
after
a
nice
long
bike
ride
prost
feel
on
the
light
side
buoyed
but
some
carbonation
given
that
body
relatively
fuller
good
when
i
drink
a
belgian
the
first
thing
i
want
to
smell
taste
and
feel
a
bit
of
is
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
delivered
from
a
generous
amount
of
malt
this
beer
is
definitely
lacking
in
this
category
the
nose
is
muddled
and
the
taste
is
almost
bland
further
proof
that
some
people
really
miss
the
mark
when
going
for
belgians
you
can
try
it
for
the
experience
bit
i
would
jot
seek
this
beer
out
had
on
tap
in
a
glass
not
the
greatest
belgian
style
pale
ale
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
nice
simple
yet
complex
but
easy
and
light
well
done
for
the
style
overall
very
drinkable
and
tasty
im
impressed
check
out
that
tightly
woven
head
with
bright
white
foambrussels
lacing
and
about
a
half
inch
of
thickness
its
a
dull
coppery
color
with
moderate
carbonation
thats
an
interesting
melange
of
aroma
with
the
belgian
yeast
strain
and
a
faint
bit
of
piney
hops
the
flavor
is
strongly
the
belgian
yeast
strain
and
then
you
get
a
bit
of
piney
hops
in
the
fade
the
mouth
is
heavily
carbonatedchalky
and
dry
poured
a
cloudy
gold
body
that
has
large
head
and
lace
patches
due
to
carbonation
aroma
is
mostly
citric
hoppiness
and
a
touch
of
funk
and
yeast
not
much
of
a
malty
aroma
although
breadyeast
come
through
i
found
the
beer
to
be
slightly
chewey
and
bready
smooth
even
a
little
boozy
sweet
malts
and
possible
sweet
fruits
in
there
but
mostly
the
beer
is
dry
and
very
hoppy
citricorange
is
prevelant
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
found
the
hoppiness
slightly
overpowering
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
not
a
perfect
balance
overall
in
brew
your
own
magazine
jamil
zainasheff
suggests
that
when
you
are
designing
a
belgian
pale
ale
you
should
not
use
citrusy
or
catty
americantype
hops
as
they
seem
to
clash
with
rather
than
accentuate
the
phenols
and
ester
from
fermentation
i
think
thats
a
little
bit
of
whats
going
on
here
i
definitely
dont
hate
it
and
i
recognize
its
not
trying
to
be
the
truest
example
of
the
style
but
there
is
a
touch
of
clash
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
until
i
read
zainasheffs
comments
ultimately
this
beer
is
kind
of
like
me
pretty
to
look
at
but
built
to
be
slightly
disagreeable

bottle

let
this

for
too

oh

pours
a
light
copperdark
gold
color
with
big
fast
creamy
frothy
head
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
aroma
of
earthy
yeast
and
hop
orange
pine
dirt
hay
flavor
is
earthy
yeast
straw
and
maybe
some
stale
hops
probably
let
this
sit
a
little
long
but
not
bad
yeasty
farmhouse
funk
easy
drinking
and
plenty
of
carbonation
i
like
this
one
very
wellbalanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
cut
by
the
hoppy
goodness
at
the
forefront
it
finished
with
notes
of
spice
and
yeast
complex
but
not
pretentious
ill
certainly
have
another
well
done
perennial
a
delightful
little
beer
here
a
clever
take
on
an
underwhelming
americanized
style
this
pours
like
champagne
clear
light
yellow
and
very
brightly
carbonated
its
got
a
semisweet
nose
with
touches
of
honey
and
clover
meadow
cascading
my
senses
belgian
yeast
more
like
a
witbier
than
a
pale
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
be
sassy
without
being
bold
or
brash
the
taste
is
exactly
as
i
described
the
nose
with
some
almost
wild
yeast
elements
creeping
in
and
more
of
the
honey
flavor
without
the
sugar
on
the
finish
fully
fermented
by
what
appears
to
be
a
very
active
and
powerful
strain
of
belgian
yeast
the
feel
is
a
little
out
of
place
carbonated
like
a
brut
and
finishing
dry
its
unexpectedly
light
in
that
way
and
almost
rushes
me
through
the
flavor
journey
its
super
light
and
drinkable
especially
at
under
6
abv
but
i
would
have
liked
the
feel
to
be
just
a
bit
more
relaxed
still
its
just
right
for
summer
drinking
and
is
a
great
introduction
to
perennial
ales
for
me
i
will
absolutely
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
their
stuff
and
visiting
their
brewery
my
next
pass
through
the
gateway
city
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
a
really
nice
hybrid
style
beer
a
bit
of
a
belgian
pale
a
bit
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
bit
of
a
wit
you
get
a
rich
frothy
head
of
two
fingers
somewhat
airy
so
it
starts
dimpling
right
off
and
retention
is
average
to
average
plus
offwhite
in
color
randomly
assigns
big
splotches
of
lacing
to
the
glass
not
consistent
around
the
sides
the
liquid
is
a
coppery
orange
more
red
tint
than
yellow
loads
of
effervescence
a
cloud
of
hyperactive
tiny
bubbles
churning
inside
the
nose
has
a
decided
leafy
earthy
quality
to
it
metallic
and
with
notes
of
cracked
black
pepper
and
sourdough
bread
crusts
there
is
a
softer
side
featuring
banana
flowers
and
peach
pits
not
getting
much
citrus
earthiness
builds
and
gets
close
to
asphalt
or
tar
at
times
mediumbodied
and
firm
the
carbonation
is
lower
than
would
be
expected
based
on
visual
inspection
and
it
is
dry
and
slowly
paced
from
mouth
entry
through
finish
produces
that
metal
mineral
to
earth
side
in
spades
the
herbaceousness
is
not
green
and
biting
more
like
fallen
leaves
twigs
and
bark
increase
in
sour
oranges
decrease
in
flowers
and
pepper
the
banana
bubblegum
persists
low
level
of
apricot
apple
peach
fruit
baking
soda
bread
crusts
and
toasted
dough
not
sweetly
yeasty
the
dryness
impedes
length
of
flavors
accentuates
its
bitterness
refreshing
in
its
own
way
not
really
a
personally
favored
style
m
decent
wellbalanced
taste
has
a
good
dose
of
hop
bitterness
leafy
and
earthy
touch
of
pepper
or
other
spice
belgian
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
with
more
citrus
and
grapefruit
hoppiness
dry
finish
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
average
body
complexity
of
flavor
as
expected
from
a
belgian
ale
but
with
a
healthy
kick
of
hops
was
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
average
belgian
pale
good
but
unremarkable
medium
body
well
carbonated
crisp
and
juicy
on
the
tongue
i
literally
took
two
sips
of
this
and
wanted
a
full
pour
extremely
drinkable
flavorful
and
balanced
this
should
be
a
belgian
ipa
i
mean
hops
are
in
the
name
ya
know
very
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
im
looking
forward
to
more
from
this
brewery
mild
toasty
malts
upfront
cracker
like
crispness
accentuated
by
the
belgian
yeasts
dryness
and
american
earthy
and
slight
citric
hop
flavors
such
easy
carbonated
cleansing
drinking
this
beer
is
great
and
one
i
will
buy
again

750ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
pretty
clear
gold
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
fine
bubbled
white
head
aroma
was
a
little
yeasty
with
a
nice
hit
of
clove
crisp
and
dry
light
bodied
more
clove
in
the
finish
along
with
some
citrus
and
a
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
fairly
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
the
best
beer
from
perennial
out
of
the
three
that
i
have
tried
so
far
fresh
and
in
your
face
but
without
being
aggressive
depth
and
complexity
won
us
over
and
each
sip
made
us
think
a
little
bit
more
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
generous
and
skilled
hand
adding
pacific
nw
hops
best
of
both
worlds
overall
texture
is
good
but
i
wish
it
had
delivered
a
better
flavor
if
you
are
into
floral
gum
candy
or
the
like
then
this
beer
may
be
for
you
it
is
not
for
me
the
beer
is
hazy
and
golden
hued
with
a
half
inch
or
so
of
white
head
the
aroma
brings
spice
straw
grass
herbal
scents
yeast
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
to
a
tee
a
touch
of
bready
sweetness
biscuits
fruit
before
finishing
crisp
and
dry
light
to
medium
in
body
a
solid
beer
overall
drinkable
but
simple
and
not
very
memorable
nicely
bitter
and
smooth
an
all
around
good
brew
id
recommend
for
those
looking
for
a
us
version
of
its
belgian
counterpart
its
just
a
bit
maltier
and
less
dry
hv
d
confused
by
the
weird
hop
flavor
o
i
think
this
is
an
example
of
trying
to
experiment
with
a
combination
of
styles
that
just
ends
up
not
working
that
well
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
very
average
in
the
flavor
department
o
the
beautiful
aroma
is
not
matched
by
the
flavor
which
becomes
lost
in
the
fizz
the
flavor
becomes
more
washed
out
by
the
fizz
as
the
beer
opens
up
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
huge
pillowy
three
finger
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
abundant
lacing
a
very
subtle
but
pleasant
aroma
of
belgian
tripel
yeast
and
hops
that
add
floral
tones
and
herbal
accents
extremely
wellbalanced
flavor
that
includes
tones
of
pear
a
bit
of
bitter
apple
herbs
flora
and
earthy
accents
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with
just
a
slight
bite
from
the
bittering
hops
wellcarbonated
and
fairly
light
to
the
low
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
a
recommended
belgianstyle
pale
ale
very
drinkable
a
solid
choice
for
a
summer
sipper
a
nice
homage
to
the
belgian
classic
with
an
american
twist
of
the
hop
variety
a
murky
tea
colored
brew
with
a
substantial
creamy
egg
shell
colored
head
and
lusciously
laced
the
aroma
has
a
slightly
orange
citrus
over
grainy
grass
theme
and
a
subtle
bubblegum
sweetness
a
bit
different
but
it
quickly
entices
the
palate
the
flavor
delivers
very
much
what
the
aroma
suggested
with
a
very
grassy
attack
but
with
a
decided
lemonyorange
hop
over
a
thin
bready
grain
the
hops
seep
in
with
more
and
more
gusto
and
a
suggestion
of
clove
this
really
grows
on
me
its
kind
of
more
grassy
bitter
than
i
like
but
the
citrus
and
grain
balance
it
out
pretty
nicely
this
is
medium
bodied
at
most
with
a
somewhat
frothy
feel
very
delicate
tingly
carbonation
nice
stuff
that
leaves
a
bitter
coat
way
back
on
your
tongue
recommended
o
a
nice
beer
sort
of
cross
between
a
belgian
pale
and
a
saison
with
aggressive
hopping
and
yeast
characteristics
overall
again
balanced
fairly
well
with
a
lighter
overall
feel
so
that
it
doesnt
get
bogged
down
in
booze
and
malty
sweetness
a
nice
summer
sipper
thats
full
of
flavor
and
softness
balance
etc
nice
malts
that
know
their
place
nice
ester
and
floral
additions
from
the
yeast
and
good
hops
to
balance
glad
they
didnt
try
to
overpower
any
of
the
flavors
hops
malts
booze
sweetness
wrong
yeast
flavors
etc
even
the
esters
werent
heavy
nice
job
this
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
has
some
really
nice
retention
pretty
nice
sheets
of
lacing
as
well
aroma
is
mild
subtle
spice
and
belgian
light
friutyness
with
some
earthy
aromas
but
it
is
quite
subtle
nice
though
flavor
is
nice
but
more
aggressive
than
the
aroma
with
lots
of
peppery
spicy
flavors
with
some
mild
grassy
notes
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
fine
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
light
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
belgian
pale
curious
to
try
the
bottled
version
of
it
pours
a
clear
amber
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
a
great
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malt
citrus
hops
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
earthy
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
overall
great
appearance
and
decent
aroma
and
body
this
is
definitely
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
it
was
a
great
drink
with
friends
over
for
dinner
it
went
very
well
with
some
curry
and
rice
without
overpowering
the
food
overall
i
would
have
this
again
on
tap
and
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
not
much
to
say
but
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
on
tap
at
bialys
range
pours
an
amberish
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
it
smells
of
fruity
spicy
notes
in
the
aroma
taste
follows
the
nose
well
sweet
lemon
flavor
and
fruity
up
front
which
turn
into
a
nice
spicy
earthy
hop
flavor
ends
with
a
bit
of
bubblegum
flavor
on
the
finish
solid
mouthfeel
as
it
goes
down
good
beer
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
makes
this
a
nice
session
beer
good
effort
from
perennial
overall
this
is
a
pretty
fine
and
somewhat
unique
belgian
pale
ale
it
wasnt
particularly
impressive
but
i
appreciate
the
focus
it
looks
to
be
a
versatile
food
paring
i
successfully
paired
half
of
this
bottle
with
a
dish
of
roasted
brussels
sprouts
and
chestnuts
in
a
brown
buttershallot
sauce
o
very
enjoyable
and
quite
sessionable
something
that
has
complexity
yet
doesnt
shut
you
down
after
one
pour
this
one
will
be
nice
during
the
summer
when
youre
tired
of
the
regular
old
apa
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
that
id
happily
have
again
o
when
you
name
your
bpa
hommel
bier
o
i
feel
as
if
this
is
a
great
choice
to
get
someone
new
into
the
beer
scene
but
its
nothing
spectacular
it
hits
some
nice
notes
but
it
feels
more
like
a
session
style
beer
rather
than
a
special
occasion
style
beer
a
delicious
belgian
pale
perennial
is
off
to
a
good
start
here
in
st
louis
o
very
good
brew
the
second
one
ive
had
tonight
from
them
and
they
have
both
been
amazing
this
is
very
well
crafted
you
can
tell
they
put
care
in
their
product
as
well
as
they
try
to
be
unique
very
good
4
5
overall
impression
what
a
tremendous
belgian
pale
ale
by
perennial
this
one
surprised
me
how
greatly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
it
was
the
peach
taste
on
the
backend
was
also
very
nice
get
to
perennial
ales
enjoy
this
soon
very
mediocre
representation
of
this
style
kind
of
tastes
like
a
watered
down
triple
o
easy
to
drink
and
very
clean
good
overall
but
nothing
epic
spicy
citric
floral
acidic
aroma
tropical
fruit
flavor
hint
of
acid
leafy
citric
hop
fresh
flavor
overall
very
well
balanced
would
have
again
worth
getting
ahold
of
3
75
poured
from
bomber
that
was
ice
cold
flavors
didnt
change
much
as
it
warmed
overall
a
good
but
not
amazing
beer
rich
gold
color
typical
belgian
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
but
also
easy
to
forget
overall
its
not
a
very
interesting
beer
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
not
as
flavorful
on
the
brett
end
as
i
would
like
but
a
nice
brew
that
seems
to
hit
all
the
right
marks
for
style
an
enjoyable
sour
beer
but
no
real
hook
a
fairly
average
belgian
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
copperamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
average
retention
aroma
and
taste
are
mostly
light
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
mouthfeel
is
fairly
rich
and
smooth
not
much
alcohol
presence
a
pleasant
enough
drink
but
nothing
outstanding
meh
pretty
mild
onot
super
sour
but
just
enough
tartness
to
add
character
to
a
solid
bpa
base
beer
lively
expressive
crisp
and
a
touch
of
funk
ripe
exotic
fruit
dragon
fruit
cracker
maltiness
nutty
yeast
some
musty
funk
within
hint
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
great
use
of
brett
like
that
there
is
still
a
hint
of
sweetness
here
though
i
wonder
where
this
brew
would
be
after
another
612
months
of
cellaring
glad
i
had
it
now
though
i
was
hoping
for
a
greater
brett
influence
and
a
drier
beer
not
bad
comes
off
as
a
fruity
semi
sweet
tripel
o
i
like
the
brett
addition
this
has
perhaps
a
bit
richer
with
the
malt
bill
than
i
expected
but
i
like
being
surprised
o
this
was
a
solid
beer
if
nothing
earthshattering
enjoyable
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
overall
eh
o
overall
the
taste
and
nose
were
rather
mediocre
i
think
it
was
the
wrong
base
beer
for
the
approach
unfortunate
a
near
perfect
beer
for
thanksgiving
a
little
brett
not
too
funky
or
wild
but
definitely
more
complex
than
your
standard
holiday
swill
hazy
light
amber
color
copper
tinted
with
an
inch
or
so
of
thick
white
almost
nitro
looking
head
the
nose
is
as
much
belgian
yeast
as
it
is
brett
mostly
very
light
malts
pale
and
herbal
on
the
hop
front
with
a
distinct
spice
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
basically
the
same
as
the
smell
but
the
belgian
yeast
and
brett
do
some
outstanding
tandem
work
in
fermentation
its
a
little
bigger
in
body
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
has
very
lively
carbonation
its
fruited
and
spiced
in
at
first
and
the
slightly
tannic
wild
side
comes
out
just
in
the
finish
with
maybe
a
splash
of
vinegar
nothing
harsh
or
abrasive
overall
another
beauty
from
perennial
maybe
not
as
interesting
as
some
others
but
its
a
good
potential
gateway
wild
beer
given
its
noticeable
but
approachable
brett
characteristics
good
stuff
with
the
turkey
does
hide
the
booze
really
well
though
o
for
13
99
i
expected
much
better
o
a
good
pale
ale
that
was
more
saison
than
anything
with
brett
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
yeast
and
brett
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
brett
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
brett
presence
that
is
slightly
better
in
the
taste
edit
i
will
say
this
for
the
beer
i
was
probably
a
little
harsh
on
it
when
i
wrote
the
review
because
as
it
warms
it
opens
up
immensely
and
brings
out
a
lot
more
earthiness
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
a
very
subtle
mix
of
flavors
nice
but
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
i
paid
13
nice
to
try
it
but
no
specific
quality
of
this
beer
stands
out
mf
medium
light
bodied
medium
dry
finish
overall
i
dont
get
the
brett
at
all
generic
maltiness
and
yeast
flavors
o
a
great
summer
sipper
recomended
dry
and
effervescent
spicy
and
yeast
forward
but
not
all
that
funky
lightly
sweet
and
spicy
again
not
really
funky
at
all
medium
bodied
peppery
and
dry
in
the
finish
overall
okay
not
really
all
that
much
brett
even
after
6
months
of
cellar
time
but
drinkable
nonetheless
golden
with
a
bit
of
reddish
highlights
minimal
carbonation
effervescent
carbonation
the
nose
seems
to
be
a
battle
of
brett
and
coriander
ill
give
the
brett
a
slight
advantage
the
taste
is
again
a
struggle
between
the
brett
and
coriander
and
this
is
a
much
tighter
race
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
i
just
dont
know
that
this
blend
of
flavors
really
works
well
together
this
is
a
little
less
than
i
was
hoping
for
after
trying
several
brews
from
perennial
the
beer
is
thick
with
the
kind
of
profile
for
a
belgian
ale
that
seems
to
be
prevalent
in
a
lot
of
american
interpretations
thick
and
somewhat
clogged
i
think
the
use
of
brett
here
kind
of
adds
a
little
complexity
and
pulls
it
away
from
being
a
onetrack
brew
i
guess
it
softens
things
up
an
alright
belgian
ale
but
it
could
be
something
so
much
more
o
a
very
soft
juicy
lush
drink
perhaps
offputting
if
youre
expecting
something
dry
and
musty
or
very
pale
but
i
found
similarities
to
piraat
in
both
color
and
flavor
as
well
as
to
belgian
tripels
in
general
with
their
lush
fruit
character
and
solid
body
totally
recommended
overall
3
75
while
there
are
definitely
some
elements
to
this
beer
i
positively
love
i
have
to
dock
the
score
a
bit
for
the
gushing
and
for
the
fact
that
the
flavor
just
isnt
as
vibrant
as
i
feel
it
could
be
its
strikes
me
as
one
of
many
orvalinspired
beers
but
just
doesnt
quite
recapture
the
magical
funky
weirdness
of
the
original
that
said
its
an
excellent
beer
that
can
be
found
on
the
shelf
at
pretty
much
any
time
without
needing
to
worry
about
freshness
given
the
style
im
sure
ill
find
myself
drinking
it
again
in
the
future
funky
and
malty
with
some
off
flavors
but
pretty
tasty
nonetheless
i
hope
its
something
from
rigoletto
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amberbrass
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
corn
light
brett
funk
mild
caramel
and
a
kiss
of
booze
you
know
like
that
just
straightup
bombed
chick
youve
been
eying
for
a
little
while
noting
the
number
of
shots
o
tequila
shes
been
rocking
who
then
comes
up
to
you
in
a
minor
careening
stupor
and
plants
her
tongue
right
in
your
throat
weve
all
been
there
right
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mild
orange
zest
mild
caramel
light
grass
and
a
firm
stranglehold
of
brett
in
a
good
way
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
bone
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
enough
brettinfused
bpa
but
the
smell
leaves
plenty
to
be
desired
and
the
brett
doesnt
mesh
entirely
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
beer
pours
a
rich
looking
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
loosely
blankets
without
lacing
the
nose
is
relatively
funky
with
a
slight
honey
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
spicy
ethanol
the
taste
is
definitely
more
farmhouse
than
belgian
pale
presenting
great
initial
yeastfunk
mild
honey
and
malt
sweetness
balanced
spice
and
fruit
although
the
honey
is
present
its
overpowered
by
the
yeast
until
the
beer
has
warmed
well
past
cellar
temperature
the
spicy
hops
sit
well
on
the
palate
and
complement
the
beers
funk
and
sweetness
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
ageable
balanced
belgianstyle
beer
but
also
presents
a
great
depth
and
character
and
funk
the
brett
really
makes
this
beer
complex
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
did
not
expect
the
grape
and
they
are
pushing
the
funk
pours
a
deep
golden
with
heavy
amber
accents
in
fact
this
brew
is
nearly
bronze
the
thick
fluffy
two
finger
clean
white
head
has
slightly
above
average
retention
and
leaves
behind
some
thin
delicate
lacing
grassy
hops
mild
pear
and
general
light
earthiness
grassy
notes
very
light
hints
of
apricot
pearskin
and
some
accents
of
honey
finishes
dry
and
earthy
with
continued
grassy
hop
notes
light
to
light
medium
bodied
with
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
that
feigns
slightly
heavier
as
the
brew
warms
abundant
yet
gentle
carbonation
subtlely
complex
and
incredibly
drinkable
aria
joins
hommel
bier
as
another
perennial
belgian
pale
ale
masterpiece
a
nice
sessionable
beer
that
tastes
nowhere
near
its
abv
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
but
overall
the
malt
body
is
too
much
for
me
here
id
revisit
this
one
but
its
by
no
means
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
its
style
medium
body
somewhat
higher
carbonation
dry
yet
smooth
on
the
tongue
again
i
tried
about
5
of
their
beers
in
a
row
this
evening
and
was
impressed
with
every
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
copper
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
slight
floral
hops
wet
hops
sweet
malt
spices
and
slight
dark
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
spices
hops
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
great
hoppy
and
spice
blend
in
both
aroma
and
body
i
had
high
hopes
for
my
first
perennial
ale
and
was
pretty
disappointed
ill
definitely
try
more
by
them
though
o
a
very
approachable
though
rather
simplistic
beer
flavor
is
sweet
yet
underbretted
if
there
is
such
a
word
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
price
o
not
something
id
purchase
again
at
12750ml
but
it
was
decent
to
try
once
too
mild
for
me
and
it
lacks
complexity
if
it
was
a
6
bomber
it
would
be
a
good
value
flavor
of
fruity
belgian
yeast
some
slight
noble
hop
and
malts
but
mostly
belgian
sweetness
its
an
easy
drinker
but
like
i
find
with
lots
of
belgian
pales
they
get
heavy
as
they
warm
its
a
great
belgian
pale
not
amazing
but
solid
others
mentioned
some
funk
i
dont
pick
that
up
at
all
wish
i
did
but
nope
still
a
nice
brew
well
crafted
and
solid
i
just
wouldnt
pay
the
perennial
price
for
a
bomber
of
it
sorry
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
disappointed
it
was
listed
as
a
wild
ale
so
i
was
expecting
more
funk
and
brett
but
the
brett
that
was
there
in
the
nose
didnt
mix
great
with
burnt
and
roasted
malts
if
this
is
as
expensice
as
some
of
their
other
750ml
bottles
id
say
pass
on
it
but
if
you
see
it
on
tap
it
might
be
worth
having
once
verdict
a
very
palatable
belgian
pale
ale
from
perennial
light
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
with
an
easy
finish
its
not
the
most
earthshattering
beer
out
there
but
a
well
made
beer
that
anyone
who
enjoys
belgian
beer
would
like
a
tasty
belgian
pale
for
sure
and
one
ill
definitely
have
again
pretty
good
bpa
i
enjoy
the
heavier
fruit
notes
slightly
balanced
by
some
earthy
funk
pretty
refreshing
and
yummy
brew
o
this
is
a
very
nice
belgianstyle
ale
glad
to
find
it
on
tap
at
44
stone
in
columbia
mo
overall
not
impressed
here
its
pretty
plain
so
far
i
am
it
sure
if
the
prior
reviews
of
this
brewery
are
up
to
par
with
what
i
am
expieriencing
very
nice
beer
indeed
super
tasty
and
one
i
would
think
would
go
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
by
the
pool
amazing
beer
will
definateky
add
to
redtock
overall
pretty
nice
beer
nice
base
belgian
pale
ale
good
malt
profile
very
nice
yeast
profile
with
good
esters
etc
hops
are
maybe
the
only
downfall
a
bit
as
it
gets
too
spicy
hop
flavor
and
too
bitter
in
general
too
americanized
but
still
enjoyable
the
taste
is
pleasant
with
yeast
and
phenolic
lightly
fruity
flavor
with
subtle
spice
in
the
taste
which
could
be
yeast
or
hop
derived
with
light
ripe
bananalike
aspect
and
hint
of
pepper
with
some
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
i
was
pleased
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
belgian
but
average
for
the
style
decent
beer
but
on
the
spicy
side
for
mealmost
strong
golden
strength
with
moderately
high
alcohol
level
tastewise
o
a
little
too
dry
for
me
but
i
enjoy
most
of
the
mild
characteristics
in
this
given
the
above
i
utilized
a
very
gentle
pour
resulting
in
naught
but
a
skim
of
white
foam
for
head
that
quickly
dissipated
like
sea
foam
color
was
a
brilliant
yellowgold
srm
45
with
nequality
clarity
and
it
was
my
pleasure
to
invite
my
pards
midas
mammon
and
croesus
into
my
kitchen
for
a
christmas
drink
the
nose
was
indeed
fruity
but
i
am
uncertain
that
i
would
have
said
tropical
pineapple
maybe
but
more
of
a
maltysweet
sort
of
a
nose
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
the
flavor
had
a
definite
black
pepperlike
spiciness
undoubtedly
from
the
yeast
warming
i
also
began
to
taste
a
fruitiness
but
not
sweet
fruit
more
towards
a
light
tartness
finish
was
semidry
with
the
fruity
esters
blending
and
offsetting
the
peppery
dryness
this
compares
well
with
st
bernardus
extra

which
is
more
aligned
with
my
standing
in
the
order
of
disorder
i
am

of

notes
hazy

probably
due

actually
the

place
youll
find

is
fuller
with
more

apple
grape
orange
solid
bitterness
leads
to
a
dry
finish
medium
bodied
and
crisp
well
balanced
probably
easy
to
overlook
this
beer
in
todays
market
where
flavors
are
so
pronounced
reliably
good
nice
spicy
earthy
and
dry
tastes
like
a
brash
peppery
saison
along
with
their
capital
trail
pale
ale
this
is
their
best
offering
their
flagship
beer
that
they
knocked
out
of
the
park
from
the
get
go
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
style
ales
this
one
should
be
on
your
list
to
try
o
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
had
not
liked
their
pale
ale
or
cream
ale
too
much
but
this
was
one
fine
beer
reminds
me
of
a
saison
a
lot
a
little
less
estery
though
a
very
interesting
yeast
character
with
a
solid
spoton
pilsner
maltiness
dominating
but
accented
with
moderately
peppery
phenolics
without
overdoing
it
and
nailing
the
feel
great
work
on
this
one
and
i
will
be
looking
to
buy
more
in
the
future
poured
a
cloudy
deep
gold
with
a
shortlasting
fizzy
white
head
nothing
fluffy
about
it
no
lacing
the
aroma
claims
tropical
fruit
and
spices
which
might
be
there
but
in
portions
so
small
i
cant
detect
them
it
smells
like
singel
if
that
were
a
generic
aroma
the
taste
is
equally
stereotypical
lacking
in
the
complexities
the
label
claims
there
is
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
a
decent
weight
to
the
body
not
too
heavy
or
light
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
take
on
a
singel
nothing
stunning
but
certainly
not
terrible
onice
easy
drinking
and
well
crafted
belgian
ale
o
a
refreshing
yet
complex
belgian
pale
that
has
high
drinkability
a
great
take
on
a
classic
style
o
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
nice
bananas
and
spices
throughout
and
easy
to
drink
worth
checking
out
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
brings
belgian
yeast
light
spice
a
hint
of
alcohol
simple
and
easy
drinking
not
too
sweet
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
nice
american
representation
of
an
abbey
single
a
few
small
tweaks
and
they
could
be
onto
something
o
i
wish
this
tasted
a
bit
more
like
the
nose
which
was
quite
interesting
it
turns
out
to
me
to
be
a
decent
replacement
for
an
imported
lager
pours
a
clear
yellow
the
noticeable
yeast
on
this
is
pretty
high
and
there
is
also
quite
a
strong
bit
of
lemon
going
on
as
well
this
comes
across
as
something
that
isnt
typical
for
the
style
but
it
does
have
a
smooth
feel
on
it
and
its
easy
to
drink
not
too
bad
really
overall
this
is
a
nice
bpa
a
good
beer
for
hardywwod
however
i
would
put
this
one
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
of
their
fleet
of
beer
for
the
price
you
could
go
elsewhere
and
get
more
bang
for
your
buck
just
an
average
domestic
belgian
pale
pear
notes
crisp
finish
light
esters
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
from
hardywood
but
this
was
definetly
on
the
average
side
not
a
sink
pour
because
of
cost
but
will
certainly
pawn
off
at
holiday
parties
poured
a
light
golden
body
with
good
and
head
and
thin
lace
on
top
of
a
yeasty
spicy
slightly
sweet
and
hopped
up
aroma
beer
is
light
and
smooth
and
has
a
bit
of
yeast
bite
to
it
some
tropical
fruits
seem
to
come
out
some
a
little
wild
as
there
is
a
spicy
bitterness
to
beer
also
a
touch
of
bready
and
sweet
malt
crisp
finish
although
a
little
haggard
the
flavors
in
the
beer
are
good
but
are
too
muted
at
some
points
onice
malts
flavors
and
balance
in
this
bpa
well
done
and
reasonably
priced
o
a
solid
singel
style
ale
the
malts
are
a
little
prominent
for
my
liking
and
leave
kind
of
a
toastygrainy
feel
but
a
nice
drink
nonetheless
overall
this
is
taste
wise
an
ok
example
with
out
any
problems
but
its
really
indistinct
and
nothing
to
get
excited
over
id
rather
have
something
with
a
bit
more
flavor
even
if
it
is
just
a
belgian
pal
ale
overall
hardywood
just
goes
from
strength
to
strength
in
my
book
mastering
a
broad
range
of
styles
another
fine
brew
that
i
could
have
mistaken
for
an
allagash
or
an
ommegang
overall
impression
a
great
selection
for
a
bitingly
tasty
drink
with
ample
thirst
quenching
ability
displaying
typical
belgian
pearorange
flavor
with
belgian
yeast
but
with
more
of
a
sturdy
pale
malt
backbone
would
definitely
suggest
this
beer
to
others
o
this
one
doesnt
impress
at
first
until
you
realize
that
23rds
of
the
bottle
was
finished
in
about
10
minutes
the
focus
on
pleasant
subtlety
over
chestthumping
aggressiveness
is
something
i
can
really
appreciate
here
6

looks
as
one
would
expect
pale
hazy
yellow
moderate
foamy
head
effervescent
smells
about
as
good
as
it
tastes
which
in
my
opinion
is
not
that
great
the
lemony
hops
and
pungent
yeast
is
an
off
putting
combo
adding
a
conflicting
dichotomy
of
both
sweet
and
sour
with
neither
really
blending
well
together
simple
yet
intricate
with
yeast
nuances
perhaps
too
much
so
that
would
be
our
only
gripe
with
this
beer
the
yeast
dominates
in
fact
its
a
yeast
bomb
some
taming
would
push
this
beer
into
the
exceptional
range
regardless
a
good
stab
at
an
abbeystyle
blonde
ale
o
decent
belgian
blonde
that
was
a
little
bit
different
then
im
used
to
having
but
fairly
enjoyable
asides
from
the
aroma
while
this
wasnt
my
favorite
blonde
id
definitely
try
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
really
a
fairly
tame
beer
thats
good
but
not
great
but
what
does
one
want
from
a
belgian
pale
ale
good
beer
bottle
thanks
to
matt
served
in
a
cervoise
pours
a
fairlyclear
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
nose
has
loads
of
pepper
and
just
a
touch
of
background
floral
hops
flavor
is
likewise
mostly
pepper
interesting
if
they
didnt
use
pepper
in
this
as
they
really
got
some
crazy
stuff
out
of
the
yeast
medium
body
somewhat
crisp
and
dry
just
okay
one
dimensional
i
drank
my
taster
and
then
immediately
asked
for
a
pint
of
gingerbread
stout
to
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
i
wont
try
this
again
thanks
to
steve
for
this
one
d
not
bad
there
is
an
odd
note
in
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
comes
together
pretty
well
i
dont
love
it
but
it
is
drinkable
and
a
reasonably
credible
example
of
an
obscure
style
overall
i
really
liked
how
belgian
this
one
is
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
on
the
finish
the
overall
beer
is
fine
but
bland
grainy
finish
mildly
astringent
not
a
repeat
o
my
first
offering
from
hardywood
is
not
disappointing
but
then
again
im
not
blown
out
of
the
water
this
beer
is
enjoyable
just
nothing
over
the
top
good
o
hardywood
parks
singel
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
and
is
an
interesting
and
unique
flagship
for
the
young
brewery
its
not
quite
worldclass
but
a
great
start
i
look
forward
to
checking
out
their
other
brews
o
as
far
as
flagship
beers
go
this
is
a
good
one
im
not
typically
a
bpa
fan
yet
this
is
flavorful
complex
and
quaffable
i
look
forward
to
returning
to
this
one
in
the
nottoodistantfuture
overall
except
for
the
heavy
feel
this
is
a
pretty
decent
representation
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
moderate
white
head
aroma
is
very
nice
belgian
yeasts
dominate
and
with
a
little
bit
of
banana
and
a
bit
of
a
fruity
aroma
as
well
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
the
belgian
yeasts
and
banana
really
coming
forward
at
first
its
got
a
light
crisp
fruitiness
and
then
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
at
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
thinmedium
bodied
and
just
right
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
belgian
pale
ale
and
a
great
flagship
beer
for
an
upandcoming
brewery
its
not
incredible
but
i
would
certainly
have
this
one
again
d
my
only
complaint
of
few
would
be
to
play
around
with
a
belgian
yeast
that
didnt
dry
this
out
so
much
wouldnt
hate
for
a
more
lasting
bitter
linger
otherwise
totally
crushable
and
wellmade
o
a
solid
belgian
pale
here
could
be
a
little
bit
more
malt
balanced
as
the
sweetness
from
the
yeast
and
the
thin
bitterness
from
the
hops
produces
a
finish
that
leaves
a
little
bit
to
be
desired
however
this
is
light
refreshing
and
enjoyable
a
solid
effort
from
a
burgeoning
brewery
i
also
met
the
owners
today
and
they
were
really
cool
brewery
tries
to
be
as
green
as
possible
and
form
bonds
with
the
community
in
which
it
lives
richmond
thats
good
news
for
richmonders
seems
like
theyre
always
open
to
suggestions
and
ideas
about
beers
to
produce
or
ways
to
run
the
business
over
all
i
would
say
this
is
a
great
flagship
beer
for
both
hardywook
park
craft
brewery
and
those
wanting
to
learn
more
about
beer
but
not
sure
where
to
start
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
as
you
continue
to
drink
it
the
bitterness
softens
a
bit
and
the
clove
and
banana
become
more
pronounced
overall
i
really
like
it
overall
though
not
a
bad
start
had
a
sample
of
this
at
capital
ale
in
downtown
richmond
a
while
ago
and
then
just
the
other
night
at
their
illumination
party
its
a
fairly
standard
belgian
ale
thats
very
drinkable
im
more
of
an
ipa
and
stout
kind
of
person
but
would
enjoy
this
in
the
summertime
comparable
to
an
ommegang
or
allagash
quality
beer
keep
it
up
hardywood
glad
to
see
va
get
some
more
breweries
o
this
is
a
unique
choice
for
hardywood
parks
flagship
beer
but
they
have
done
a
nice
job
to
make
this
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
belgian
blonde
though
it
is
6
2
abv
the
lighter
body
and
tasty
flavor
allow
this
to
be
a
sessionable
type
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
more
of
this
beer
especially
in
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
o
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
american
version
of
a
belgian
beer
very
easy
to
drink
i
agree
with
the
ba
categorization
of
this
as
a
bpa
somehow
singel
isnt
consistent
with
what
i
imagine
in
terms
of
taste
nor
alcohol
content
its
not
a
bipa
though
if
it
were
im
not
sure
i
could
forgive
it
but
pardon
my
digression
thats
a
dogmatic
debate
any
hop
character
is
in
the
finish
a
good
first
effort
for
a
new
brewery
im
curious
to
see
how
this
recipe
develops
and
to
try
other
brews
by
hardywood
this
new
brewery
hardywood
park
has
just
opened
in
my
hometown
richmond
va
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
their
singel
proliferate
and
become
the
daily
swill
of
our
towns
growing
beersmart
public
its
very
good
beer
my
opinion
on
belgian
style
brews
is
pretty
uninformed
but
i
really
liked
this
beer
call
me
a
homer
if
you
will
but
i
thought
it
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
my
fav
belgian
style
thus
far
the
only
other
bpa
i
have
had
was
from
ommegang
overall
im
very
very
impressed
with
hardywood
park
craft
brewery
so
far
their
singel
is
a
great
beer
and
their
farmhouse
pumpkin
is
a
wonderful
example
of
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
strive
to
be
id
give
the
singel
a
4
5
out
of
5
overall
and
i
hope
that
people
give
hardywood
a
try
in
the
near
future
overall
i
was
very
impressed
and
look
toward
to
more
from
hardywood
park
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
drink
would
make
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
in
moderation
rjt
id
like
to
try
this
a
little
fresher
because
i
pretty
greatly
enjoyed
each
bottle
after
the
firstwhich
was
really
just
exorbitantly
chunky
sans
strainingand
each
time
i
drank
one
between
intervals
of
months
i
was
surprised
how
well
this
beer
had
weathered
the
time
since
itd
been
breweed
i
expect
much
more
for
an
artesan
belgium
beer
too
acid
after
experiencing
the
amazing
beer
on
tap
at
the
huisbrouwerij
de
halve
maan
we
tried
it
bottled
in
several
restaurants
in
bruges
unfortunately
the
beer
wed
tried
was
not
available
anywhere
other
than
the
actual
brewery
and
the
bottled
product
while
very
good
couldnt
compare
tons
of
carbonation
making
for
a
difficult
pour
and
spritzy
tastefeel
pretty
bland
compared
to
other
belgians
and
slightly
sour
overall
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
a
belgian
session
ale
then
this
is
probably
fairly
close
it
sits
slightly
on
the
high
side
of
average
worth
a
shot
if
youve
not
tried
it
before
but
compared
with
the
myriad
other
beers
that
belgium
has
to
offer
theres
not
really
much
to
single
it
out
the
farting
fool
labels
are
pretty
cool
though
great
d
a
nice
fresh
straightforward
session
brew
4
there
are
a
lot
of
american
attempts
at
belgian
ales
to
keep
you
happy
it
pours
into
a
nice
head
and
amber
color
medium
carbonation
no
significant
aroma
or
flavor
other
than
a
tiny
bit
flowery
at
room
temp
the
carbonation
is
gone
and
smells
like
a
pilsener
urquell
tastes
like
an
urquell
but
not
so
dry
drink
it
while
is
cold
and
forget
about
it
a
very
decent
beer
overall
a
very
good
tasting
beer
this
is
a
spicy
sweet
beer
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
the
carbonation
is
like
many
belgian
ales
not
just
bubbly
but
foamy
to
the
mouth
overall
a
pretty
decent
belgian
pale
ale
with
plenty
of
quality
belgian
yeasts
and
some
fruits
and
spices
the
only
real
detractor
is
the
truly
catastrophic
price
of
au150
for
a
case
of
24
x
300ml
2013
which
is
pretty
close
to
the
most
expensive
of
the
600
beers
i
have
had
thus
far
i
can
probably
run
a
list
of
at
least
50
beers
that
are
better
than
this
and
cost
30
40
less

brugse
zot
fool

doesnt

around
it
is
a
wellbrewed
textbook
belgian
pale
ale
that
having
had
the
fortune
of
trying
it
so
fresh
from
draught
minutes
from
where
its
brewed
i
enjoyed
so
much
so
that
it
may
be
my
personal
choice
for
quintessential
example
of
the
style
the
body
was
as
expected
on
the
light
side
of
medium
a
bit
sticky
in
the
middle
and
had
medium
dry
finish
drinkability
was
pretty
good
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
but
this
is
a
style
i
like
in
general
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
a
rather
lovely
brew
that
goes
down
all
too
easily
it
looks
great
and
the
aromaflavour
are
balanced
and
satisfying
earthy
fruity
yeast
esters
and
subtle
hop
notes
mingle
to
produce
a
solidly
crafted
belgian
pale
ale
the
body
is
spot
on
very
drinkable
and
if
i
lived
in
belgium
i
could
easily
imagine
this
becoming
a
regular
fridge
beer
well
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
though
i
recommend
trying
it
in
bruges
pours
a
deep
golden
hue
with
a
medium
slowly
fading
off
white
head
aroma
and
taste
is
of

some
citrus
and

notes
grains
and
a

carbonation
on
the
palate
finishes
with
a
sweet
biscuit
malt
yeast
some
fruity
notes
and
some

bitterness
on
the
end
overall
a
good
drinking
session
ale
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
nice
beer
cross
between
blond
and
wit
with
the
better
characters
of
each
coming
through
nice
taste
dry
finish
juicy
center
overall
a
gentle
but
complex
beer
with
many
nuances
of
aromas
and
flavors
recommended
othis
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
the
looks
and
mouthfeel
are
high
points
but
it
is
a
touch
sweet
and
cloying
and
could
use
a
little
more
hop
for
balance
still
i
err
on
the
sweet
side
sometimes
so
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
someone
offered
me
another
asides
from
the
above
average
smell
and
the
beginning
of
the
taste
profile
this
beers
over
abundance
of
unfiltered
matter
makes
it
feel
like
our
drinking
orang
juice
with
extra
pulp
i
dont
enjoy
eating
my
beer
however
if
one
can
get
over
the
immense
yeasty
foreground
and
unfiltered
matter
this
beer
will
be
the
incarnate
of
god
himself
not
much
of
a
belgian

more

some

knock

a

beer
which
i

is
the
purpose
good
in
context
but
you
can
get
more
out
of
your
belgian
pa
an
eh
beer
from
an
otherwise
trustworthy
brewery
in
my
favorite
belgian
town
this
one
has
plenty
of
aroma
but
very
little
in
terms
of
taste
in
fact
it
has
virtually
no
flavor
when
cold
i
heated
it
up
on
a
radiator
for
about
30
minutes
when
warm
it
gained
some
cloves
and
a
little
fruit
overall
the
low
levels
of
belgianness
would
if
amplified
several
times
amount
to
a
really
nice
beer
in
its
current
state
however
its
just
dull
served

throughout

the

was

of

a

the
flavor
was
of
sweet

bread
fruit
floral
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
while
this
a
was
a
good
brew
it
wasnt
very
memoriable
i
would
have
loved
to
see
this
one
have
some
more
complexity
to
carry
it
to
a
new
level
the
flavors
present
were
nice
but
they
definitely
needed
some
other
components
going
on
to
make
them
pop
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
again
o
not
a
bad
belgian
pale
ale
very
drinkable
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
worth
a
try
cheers
fragrant

recalls
peach
in
the
aftertaste
there
are
drought
with
a
touch

but
still
in
the
cold
a
beer
strong
enough
with
many
flavors
which
is
a
model
of
its
kind
overall
nice
drink
notes
definitely
has
a
unique
hard
to
describe
character
that
makes
belgians
wonderful
definitely
not
to
a
style
its
oddness
and
the
metallic
dryness
hurt
drinkability
a
touch
for
me
but
its
flavor
combinations
while
not
dynamic
are
very
interesting
you
particularly
get
the
feeling
with
this
beer
that
the
brewers
really
dont
care
what
i
write
about
this
beer
and
i
like
that
o
a
nice
refreshing
and
quaffable
beer
its
overall
sweetness
is
probably
too
dominant
and
gets
quite
boring
after
a
while
some
beers
do
age
well
unfortunately
this
bottle
for
whatever
reason
has
not
pours
a
bright
clody
gold
rich
white
froth
and
some
lace
aroma
of
peppery
belgian
yeast
candi
sugar
and
some
flowery
hop
tastes
like
a
clean
blonde
slightly
sweet
lemonyherbal
touch
little
to
no
bite
belgian
yeast
adds
a
subtle
fruityness
alittle
sweet
but
mellow
and
easy
drinking
for
a
decent
sized
beer
semi
dry
mouthfeel
consider
it
a
nice
blonde
o
good
beer
recommended
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
perhaps
my
bottle
is
a
bit
off
or
its
not
to
my
taste
but
i
didnt
enjoy
the
experience
i
wont
be
repeating
it
still
its
not
bad
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
try
this
again
because
the
taste
wasnt
very
interesting
drinkability
a
step
down
from
a
triple
this
could
be
a
much
better
beer
if
bumped
up
a
bit
on
the
abv
pint
at
belgos
1
finger
head
paler
than
other
beers
i
know
from
belgium
clear
smelled
of
belgian
yeast
had
the
same
slightly
sour
berry
taste
that
other
belgian
pale
ales
have
there
was
also
some
wheat
the
body
was
smooth
this
was
the
most
sessionable
belgian
beer
ive
had
so
far
not
overly
complex
but
good
d
highly
drinkable
and
decent
beer
d
great
beer
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
but
with
some
nice
flavors
all
the
notes
are
subtle
but
still
appreciated
drink
ill
have
this
again
i
liked
it
a
lot
very
good
choice
for
a
sessionbeer
in
a
bar
d
a
nice
little
bpa
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
light
malt
flavor
with
a
definitive
yeast
bite
warm
swallow
but
not
really
strong
on
the
alcohol
full
bodied
with
a
predictable
level
of
carbonation
only
demerit
is
a
short
aftertaste
without
any
notable
hop
flavoring
other
than
for
balance
md
well
carbonated
medium
body
smooth
this
was
a
nice
brew
although
i
was
expecting
more
for
the
money
from
tasting
notes
made
september
2009
d
goes
down
very
easily
quite
tasty
this
is
a
perfect
warm
spring
or
summer
day
beer
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
very
smooth
could
drink
this
all
day
on
a
lazy
afternoon
belgian
yeast
really
plays
well
in
every
aspect
from
the
nose
to
the
throat
bready
spicy
fruity
and
gets
along
with
the
other
kids
malt
and
hops
recommended
this
was
a
good
light
pale
ale
there
was
still
some
malt
body
on
the
tongue
despite
the
light
taste
the
bitter
aroma
was
in
the
nose
but
less
yeasty
than
the
tripel
of
this
brewery
unfiltered
and
the
wheat
that
is
used
in
the
recipe
comes
out
with
the
twinge
of
light
sweetness
o
too
much
honey
sweetness
taste
is
not
bad
and
i
think
i
can
get
past
the
plethora
of
floaties
we
shall
see
upon
subsequent
pours
taste
is
light
and
delicate
hints
of
green
apples
and
overripe
plums
well
carbonated
and
goes
down
pretty
easily
yeast
does
most
of
the
work
for
this
beer
and
the
esters
it
produces
are
pretty
pleasant
malt
is
light
and
a
bit
grainy
but
pretty
neutral
overall
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
bitternes
and
even
a
bit
of
flavor
but
keeps
it
on
the
down
low
despite
playing
a
significant
roll
in
the
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
chunks
of
sediment
i
can
feel
passing
through
my
lippage
gateway
this
would
be
a
fine
belgium
beer
d
the
drikability
was
excellent
after
a
few
days
of
tripels
and
quadtruples
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
hiatus
but
at
6
it
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
so
beware
serving
type
33
cl
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
id
be
happy
to
visit
again
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
good
head
but
no
lacing
the
smell
is
passive
with
hints
of
apple
bread
and
belgian
yeast
the
taste
is
but
rather
refreshing
with
fruits
apples
orange
and
kind
of
a
bread
malt
flavor
and
a
hint
of
hop
the
mouth
feel
is
very
light
and
packed
with
carbonation
with
the
lightness
and
the
carbonation
make
this
beer
very
quaffable
i
could
drink
a
few
more
d
if
not
for
the
great
selection
at
cafe
bruges
id
have
stuck
with
this
mild
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
this
one
its
a
nicely
made
and
easy
drinking
belgian
beer
well
worth
a
try
taste
this
is
a
very
below
average
belgian
blonde
slight
taste
of
apricot
not
good
d
pretty
drinkable
and
complex
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
the
yeast
character
is
nice
though
the
bubblegum
character
is
a
bit
much
i
was
a
little
disappointed
was
expecting
more
from
this
belgian
notes
great
to
have
it
unfiltered
at
the
brewery
in
brugge
you
simply
cannot
find
it
better
than
that
drinkability
soso
except
when
you
calculate
the
price
i
expected
something
exciting
for
the
22
24
with
tax
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sourstyle
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
pick
first
d
overall
a
great
quaff
id
probably
reclassify
this
as
a
belgian
blonde
due
to
coloration
and
subtle
hop
characteristics
d
this
is
a
light
drinkable
beer
not
overly
complex
but
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
a
off
golden
with
a
bit
murk
sweet
lemon
odor
no
musk
really
at
first
smells
quite
crisp
with
a
nice
tight
head
of
bubble
that
dissipate
taste
is
a
mild
lemon
hop
with
a
bit
of
mint
and
lavender
not
very
assertive
light
drink
but
nothing
special
for
the
price
on
this
side
of
the
water
ontap
in
ghent
another
tasty
belgian
pale
ale
appeared
a
pretty
gold
in
the
zot
semichalice
this
had
a
mediumthickness
mouthfeel
like
youd
expect
for
a
6
beer
but
the
flavor
was
lighter
and
seemed
to
lift
the
beer
up
to
a
more
drinkable
standard
typical
but
fresh
belgian
malt
and
spice
flavors
an
excellent
standard
of
a
beer
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
metallic
with
malt
spice
and
yeast
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
large
head
the
flavor
has
bananas
cloves
malt
spice
and
grass
the
palate
is
thin
overall
an
interesting
but
average
beer
i
thought
it
had
a
couple
of
nice
qualities
but
its
not
something
i
want
often
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
just
not
my
type
of
thing
overall
pretty
plain
and
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
it
poured
a
slightly
under
ripe
peach
with
some
visible
floaters
and
some
mild
carbonation
the
head
was
initially
large
and
held
well
spotty
lacing
the
nose
was
yeast
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
straightforward
belgian
pale
ale
noticeable
spice
belgian
yeast
and
a
nice
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
carbonation
was
mild
and
at

very
drinkable
overall
a
solid
bpa
poured
into
an
oversized

with

i
thought
the

notes
were
subdued
but
were
noticeable
flavors
are
tilted
to
the
spice
as
well
but
a
decent
herbal
hop
smack
comes
thru
in
the
finish
not
overly
complexpretty
straight
forward
but
not
all
that

great
beer
in

down

not
bad
but
a
bit
too
metallic
and
crackery
for
me
to
really
enjoy
carbonation
just
a
bit
too
inconsistent
overall
still
it
does
have
some
nice
qualities
a
good
balance
interesting
fruitiness
pretty
good
but
with
so
many
great
belgians
out
there
i
probably
wouldnt
choose
it
again
though
glad
to
have
tried
it
this
ones
very
drinkable
and
you
can
get
a
33cl
bottle
in
bruges
grocery
stores
for
less
than
1
euro
750ml
corked
caged
and
canned
for
good
measure
it
forms
a
very
agressive
head
thick
and
soapy
white
over
a
clear
effervescent
pale
gold
the
smell
is
soapy
power
of
suggestion
sugary
and
full
of
clean
grains
the
taste
is
pleasantly
chalky
with
a
sharp
hop
note
at
first
and
then
a
pleasant
malt
back
a
bone
dry
finish
that
hints
of
oranges
and
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
carbonated
as
it
looks
but
certainly
not
lacking
it
is
slick
but
light
drinkability
is
good
not
too
assertive
to
have
a
few
all
in
all
a
nice
pale
ale
a
good
alternative
to
duvel
albeit
in
a
much
higher
price
range
it
is
subtle
but
wellcrafted
pours
a
clear
blush

amber
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
quickly
dissapears
bland
aroma
of
light

and
subtle

notes
very
watered
down
with
light
fruit
flavors
apple
pear
and
slight
spiciness
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
orange
hues
and
a
3
finger
white
extra
cloudy
head
that
settles
to
a
12
finger
head
that
remains
with
patchy
lacing
aromas
of
cloves
banana
lemon
and
honey
light
body
medium
high
carbonation
this
is
sweet
and
dry
beer
with
orange
vanilla
sweet
malt
and
an
earthy
hop
flavor
good
drinkability
the
balance
of
the
hops
keeps
the
sweetness
in
line
d
drinkable
but
for
the
price
there
are
definitely
better
belgian
options
out
there
cant
say
that
ill
be
having
again
d
it
was
a
complex
beer
that
may
have
benefited
from
a
bit
more
aging
the
aggressive
carbonation
was
a
turn
off
but
the
flavors
were
spot
on
and
it
was
a
nice
light
and
low
abv
ale
that
could
go
long
into
a
session
this
beer
pours
up
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
nose
consists
of
grains
and
slight
honey
pretty
straight
forward
the
taste
is
of
sweet
pale
malts
crisp
hops
honey
medium
body
very
spritzy
carbo
taste
is
a
bit
watery
at
first
but
it
settles
in
nicely
good
dry
and
spiciness
and
the
carbonation
cuts
thorugh
and
tingles
dry
powdery
chalk
is
kinda
in
there
but
its
not
prevailant
its
a
damn
fine
beer
good
sourbitter
qualities
and
as
it
warms
up
and
decarbonates
i
get
a
lot
more
nuances
the
drinkability
is
a
solid
4
with
a
very
quenching
quality
but
also
a
lot
flavor
this
beer
keeps
it
pretty
simple
but
it
works
very
well

some

medium

drinkable
this
is
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
its
a
nice
one
i
got
this
beer
as
a
present
in
a
huge
decorated
can
with
a
75
cl
corked
bottle
inside
ignoring
the
fris
opdienen
serve
cool
directive
i
opened
the
bottle
at
room
temperature
and
was
rewarded
with
a
loud
pop
as
the
cork
all
but
flew
off
after
pouring
it
in
a
westmalle
chalice
horror
the
head
that
formed
was
very
thin
but
persistent
the
color
is
a
nice
crystal
clear
yellow
its
got
a
lovely
sweet
and
fruity
smell
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
it
and
has
the
same
sweetness
honey
as
the
smell
i
found
it
very
pleasant
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
which
could
be
due
to
the
high
drinking
temperature
d
i
dont
dislike
this
beer
but
not
on
my
session
list
i
would
like
to
try
more
belgian
pale
ales
the
only
other
i
have
had
has
the
jp
firefly
gotta
expand
my
tastebud
horizons
d
refreshing
summer
beer
made
for
better
weather
than
belgium
offers
enough
lighter
than
a
bspa
to
be
just
about
right
still
pretty
good
thickness
and
overall
heft
plenty
of
hopping
which
is
nice
well
attenuated
and
quenching
to
the
palate
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
huge
fizzy
white
head
that
resists
fading
kept
alive
by
visible
effervescence
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
an
earthy
yeast
with
banana
and
harvest
fruits
tingling
fizzy
the
mouth
feel
is
light
the
earthy
banana
flavor
is
strong
and
complemented
by
a
fruity
pear
character
at
6
abv
its
sessionable
nice
holiday
tin
take
it
for
a
ride
this
is
a
good
belgian
but
not
a
brilliant
one
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
cloudy
yellow
with
clumps
and
i
mean
clumps
of
free
floating
yeast
this
isnt
yeasty
bits
but
quite
significant
pieces
from
its
unfiltered
bottle
fermentation
im
not
sure
if
that
is
such
a
good
thing
the
smell
is
typically
belgian
in
that
you
get
the
sweet
candied
malts
some
florals
and
some
rind
the
taste
is
all
of
the
above
with
quite
a
yeast
effervescence
some
spices
such
as
clove
and
a
slightly
sourish
malty
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
it
balances
well
with
the
carbonation
the
beer
has
quite
a
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
throughout
the
aftertaste
is
modest
as
is
its
abv
this
isnt
a
strong
beer
nor
an
overly
complex
one
but
it
is
good
drinking
lchaim
oh
and
at6
75
a
bottle
i
wont
order
one
of
these
at
brewhaus
again
dthis
one
is
good
for
a
single
glass
at
a
timenothing
super
going
on
herebut
pretty
enjoyable
as
wellgive
it
a
try
decent
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
mouthfeel
is
typical
as
well
with
nice
carbonation
d
a
nice
bpa
though
the
flavour
profile
overall
was
too
light
for
me
at
times
definitely
worth
a
shot
id
definitely
drink
it
again
not
sure
the
classification
is
correct
as
i
would
call
it
a
belgian
blonde
but
since
we
dont
have
that
category
pale
ale
will
have
to
do
taste
even
veers
towards
a
witbier
golden
color
medium
head
funky
aroma
of
yeast
and
phenolic
and
more
yeast
decently
carbonated
and
easy
easy

probably
going
to
suck
down
this
whole
750
ml
bottle
myself
tonight
mouth
feel
rich
and
full
quite
excellent
drinkability
quite
nice

a
clear
yellow
with
slight
orange
colors
a
peachy
slight
haze
and
great
white
head
that
leaves
good
lace
nose
is
vinous
and
sour
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
quite
sour
with
some
almost
white
wine
notes
some
spices
here
and
some
apple
flavors
on
the
extremely
dry
finish
almost
sour
on
the
finish
but
in
a
good
way
with
granny
smith
tones
mouthfeel
is
good
but
sour
drinkability
is
good
but
the
sourness
detracts
from
it
just
a
bit
pours
a
hazed
straw
gold
with
a
bright
white
head
that
does
not
stick
around
nose
is
like
soap
and
light
yeast
flavor
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
fruity
tone
to
it
strong
sweet
character
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
at
first
the
carbonation
was
so
alive
that
bubbles
were
bouncing
on
my
tongue
very
drinkable
an
easily
sessionable
beer
if
not
for
the
price
flavor
is
underwhelming
not
much
in
the
way
as
to
the
style
described
just
some
sweet
malts
rather
light
change
the
yeast
and
wed
have
an
alalt
lager
i
think
probably
a
pretty
good
one
too
but
as
a
bpa
this
beer
is
missing
some
flavors
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
bit
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
much
drinkable
because
it
is
nice
and
light
but

being
easy
to
drink
is
what
this
beer
excels
at
not
overly
complex
and
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
it
is
worth
a
try
this
is
decent
but
nothing
special
in
a
world
of
belgian
beers
that
kick
its
ass
certainly
easy
to
drink
id
never
turn
it
away
glad
i
tried
it
but
there
are
more
convincing
examples
of
the
style
out
there
flavor
is
a
different
story
bananas
pears
apples
and
clove
spice
a
touch
of
pepper
spice
and
some
nice
sourness
round
everything
out
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
and
offers
everything
i
want
mildly
wheaty
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
hops
noble
perhaps
light
and
crisp
body
clean
well
done
and
highly
drinkable
very
well
balanced
sweet
light
spice
and
sessionability
is
ok
not
my
idea
of
highly
drinkable
but
passable
and
i
would
try
this
again
overall
a
bit
dissapointing
but
still
better

4
39
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
this
is
a
summers
day
drink
there
are
so
many
very
good
belgian
ales
out
there
that
this
one
is
just
above
midtable
in
my
opinion
the
better
ones
can
be
taken
all
year
not
just
in
the
warm
weather
the
bottle
came
in
a
big
golden
can
reminiscent
of
a
fine
scotch
so
my
expectations
were
rather
high
inside
the
can
was
the
bottle
corked
and
caged
as
most
selfrespecting
blondes
are
wont
to
do
in
europe
it
pours
a
nice
vigorous
head
dissipating
very
rapidly
leaving
behing
a
very
cloudylooking
yeasty
golden
brew
the
smell
is
very
faint
if
anything
a
bit
of
citrus
perhaps
the
taste
is
strikingly
similar
to
the
great
ciders
of
the
north
and
northwest
of
france
with
a
mixture
of
wellbalanced
blonde
belgian
beer
im
not
certain
how
they
brewed
this
but
great
brut
cider
apples
are
definitely
an
outcome
of
the
flavor
and
if
these
were
not
somehow
involved
id
be
rather
amazed
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
generating
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
as
this
goes
down
without
any
complaints
from
the
tongue
or
throat
leaving
a
nice
aftertaste
of
well
cider
overall
im
not
sure
whether
or
not
ive
just
had
a
cider
or
a
beer
i
would
not
call
this
a
great
blonde
beer
of
belgium
since
this
would
have
to
stand
on
its
own
merits
alone
and
pound
its
chest
as
a
blonde
but
not
bad
at
all
d
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
daynight
pretty
low
abv
6
so
ya
this
one
is
fit
for
a
session
if
you
can
handle
a
sweet
brew
all
night
the
beer
tastes
lightly
well
not
it
is
fairly
sweet
but
it
is
deceptive
as
it
is
quite
light
on
the
palate
the
flavor
is
grassy
with
notes
of
hay
these
notes
seem
to
be
derived
from
both
the
malt
grain
character
as
well
as
the
particular
hop
choice
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
pale
malt
character
to
it
the
combination
of
malt
sweetness
biscuit
notes
and
touches
of
soda
crackers
really
compliments
the
grassy
hop
notes
this
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
malt
accented
yet
still
quite
hoppy
pils
and
a
belgian
ale
which
is
i
suppose
quite
what
the
brewer
was
attempting
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
i
can
definitely
see
quaffing
a
few
of
these
on
a
seasoned
summer
day
md
very
good
beer
nice
bitter
bite
and
well
balanced
great
for
pretzels
with
spicy
mustard
would
def
be
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
refreshingly
balanced
brew
could
use
just
a
touch
more
spice
definite
session
pale
if
there
is
such
a
thing
recommended
for
sure
md
drinkable
yes
mouthfeel
good
a
rather
impressice
belgian
im
not
talking
high
high
levels
but
still
hig
quality
and
a
good
drinking
beer
drinkability
soso
at
best
from
a
drinking
standpoint
it
is
easy
to
quaff
but
the
flavor
profile
is
just
dull
and
unexciting
personally
one
glass
was
more
than
enough
for
me
pours
attractive
golden
straw
with
a
small
but
superbly
creamy
head
and
lace
the
beer
is
very
active
in
the
glass
and
has
a
touch
of
yeasty
haze
the
aroma
displays
lime
green
grass
hop
and
earth
notes
flavor
never
really
comes
together
begins
with
rounded
honeylike
malt
develops
a
shallow
hop
and
grass
center
and
finishes
with
an
unpleasing
metallic
sourness
lighttomedium
in
body
some
chewiness
balances
the
toogassy
carbonation
great
looking
but
mediocre
tasking
overall
impression
once
im
past
the
metallic
note
i
enjoyed
the
beer
a
nice
reminder
of
brugge
drinkability
very
appropriate
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
at
the
price
point
i
dont
think
i
will
be
drinking
this
much
drinkability
not
a
bad
choice
nothing
really
crazy
going
on
with
the
beer
fairly
balanced
whichever
you
pick
will
do
a
lot
better
than
my
mistaken
purchase
d
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
take
the
aromas
and
flavors
and
mix
it
a
rather
low
abv
and
you
end
up
with
quite
a
refreshing
bpa
dont
let
the
low
score
82
when
i
reviewed
it
scare
you
off
i
found
this
little
beer
to
be
complex
enough
and
satisfying
would
be
a
perfect
session
beer
for
sipping
on
all
day
while
doing
work
around
the
house
when
you
actually
need
to
complete
the
tasks
at
hand
try
doing
that
with
duvel
or
delirium
tasted
like
a
cross
between
a
duvel
and
a
delerium
highly
drinkable
i
finished
two
with
dinner
at
a
local
belgian
restaurant
poured
a
goodlooking
golden
brown
with
a
decent
creamy
head
fairly
low
in
carbonation
and
very
refreshing
despite
the
6
abv
i
found
i
to
be
quite
light
defintely
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
one
neat
looking
bottle
graphic
too
d
interesting
beer
i
bet
theres
some
people
out
there
who
really
like
this
one
for
me
its
a
bit
unbalanced
and
i
dont
find
myself
enticed
to
drink
it
for
each
their
own
online
purchase
poured
in
tulip
golden
and
with
a
very
nice
white
lacey
head
light
sweet
fruity
smell
with
some
mild
spicy
overtones
very
typical
of
a
belgian
blond
ale
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
hey
its
a
blond
no
regrets
except
that
theyre
gone
pricey
but
i
dont
remember
the
last
time
i
found
a
belgian
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
that
wasnt
drinkability
crisp
with
a
light
fruitiness
and
some
nice
hoppiness
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
up
to
some
other
similar
but
far
superior
beers
from
that
wonderful
corner
of
the
world
notes
first
time
ive
seen
this
brew
and
i
got
it
at
a
high
priced
shop
so
im
sure
they
got
a
pretty
nice
profit
at
4
for
11
ounces
a
good
beer
that
i
would
need
to
find
cheaper
to
have
anytime
soon
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
beer
too
sweet
and
sticky
with
too
much
gas
which
really
slow
down
drinkability
draft

there
mouth
is
spot
on
for
style
enough
body
and
carbonation
to
show
balance
a
beer
this
tasty
and
complex
can
only
be
very
drinkable
im
giving
it
a
five
as
it
all
comes

one
of
the
better
belgian
pales

that
has
entered
my
glass
in
quite
a
while
at
3
49
its
a
bit
expensive
for
regular
consumption
but
im
glad
that
its
available
locally
and
that
i
can
grab
a
bottle
whenever
the
mood
strikes
good
beer
i
liked
this
brew
for
what
it
was
a
simple
highly
drinkable
session
beer
did
it
blow
me
away
with
complexity
no
but
ya
know
what
it
wasnt
meant
to
big
carbonation
initially
that
settles
down
towards
the
finish
medium
in
the
body
and
quite
easy
too
drink
its
worth
a
try
but
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
drinkability
a
subtle
but
complex
beer
the
blend
of
sweet
and
herbacious
bitter
flavors
is
wellexecuted
i
would
say
this
was
a
lighter
than
in
color
than
i
expected
with
the
slightest
bit
of
haze
initially
i
noticed
the
spices
and
honey
that
came
out
from
the
foam
there
was
plenty
of
tiny
thick
foam
bubbles
which
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
and
left
a
nice
lace
around
the
glass
the
taste
was
a
bit
fruity
peaches
pears
and
apricots
spices
like
pepper
coriander
orangepeel
could
be
tasted
and
malt
made
a
bit
of
a
presence
but
did
not
steal
the
show
the
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
leaving
behind
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
presence
that
seemed
fairly
strong
for
the
taste
strength
and
alcohol
seemed
to
increase
as
the
glass
emptied
the
finish
left
me
a
little
less
satisfied
than
the
i
anticipated
upon
the
initial
sip
a
new
offering
by
pazzos
pizza
pub
here
in
lexington
predictably
belgian
pale
ale
in
character
beginning
with
a
lightly
hazy
brightly
colored
yellow
hue
and
spicy
honeylike
aromas
overcompensation
with
the
head
retention
and
carbonation
leaving
a
loosely
knit
foamy
head
tastes
typically
fruity
peaches
pears
pineapples
and
apricots
spicy
pepper
corriander
orangepeel
and
malty
pilsner
honeylike
fairly
smooth
rich
texture
with
an
alcohol
that
seems
more
than
the
labled
6
finishes
a
little
on
the
dry
and
alcoholic
side
but
satsfying
nonetheless
a
good
comparison
to
duvel
just
not
as
bold
or
melded
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
this
style
the
bold
carbonation
helps
give
it
a
little
more
substance
but
its
a
little
weak
weakest
of
all
is
the
flavor
or
perhaps
its
delicate
dried
bananas
and
perhaps
some
green
veggies
come
through
peas
the
flavor
is
overall
unimpressive
and
as
the
belgians
say
un
peu
plat
its
very
drinkable
and
i
would
replace
it
as
my
keg
beer
any
day
but
unless
it
costs
1
50
euros
or
less
which
i
purchased
it
for
at
the
marvel
known
as
the
supermarkets
in
the
lowlands
i
would
skip
this
one
there
are
thousands
of
brilliant
examples
of
belgium
craftsmanship
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
brugse
zot
erm
not
md
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
refreshing
without
too
much
influence
of
sugar
and
overly
strong
flavour
like
quite
a
few
belgian
strong
pale
ale
counterparts
but
this
advantage
of
being
simple
and
light
is
somehow
played
into
the
other
extreme
of
tasting
rather
dull
watery
and
lack
of
depth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
much
more
boring
than

almost
gave

rarely
can
i
find

beer
that
successfully
marries
sourness
with
hops
as
someone
who
dislikes
hops
in
general
anytime
a
beer
has
a
powerful
hops
flavor
it
tends
to
be
overpowering
rayon
vert
however
finds
a
way
to
balance
a
powerful
sourness
with
a
powerful
hops
flavor
and
does
so
with
both
finesse
and
strength
well
done
overall
excellent
we
have
a
winner
of
the

pageant
right
here

with
some
spice
and
a

of

those

things
are

with
coriander
and
even
a
bit
of
a
cardamom
a
bit
astringent
crisp
medium
mouth
without
a
lot
of
carbonation
its
not
as
refined
and
balanced
as
orval
but
nonetheless
good
if
youre
a
brett
head
overall
while
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
smelled
its
flavor
is
a
bit
messy
despite
having
some
very
pleasing
characteristics
if
this
is
one
to
lay
down
two
years
is
either
too
long
or
some
sort
of
awkward
phase
qualities
of
a
pale
with
lots
of
brett
overall
just
okay
not
the
brewerys
best
effort
i
may
have
to
go
buy
my
store
out
of
4
packs
of
this
should
be
good
for
a
few
years
o
would
i
drink
this
at
cellar
temperate
along
with
my
favorite
belgians
yes
not
quite
as
round
or
fruit
intense
not
quite
as
redwine
like
but
all
the
upper
notes
are
here
and
then
some
original
ones
bravo
a
must
try
not
disappointed
warm
warm
warm
poured
from
a
12
oz

into
a
belgian
goblet
this
beer
is
inspired
by
orval
and
is
indeed
alive
with
funk
more
so
than
its
more
esteemed
trappist
progenitor
i
have
yet
to
encounter
so
much
head
on
a
beer
the
entire
glass
is
filled
with
soft
beige
bubbles
and
subsequent
pours
are
just
as
billowing
as
the
first
the
head
does
calm
down
if
you
wait
a
moment
and
like
orval
is
savagely
bitter
if
you

the
number
of
flavor
elements
i
register
is
quite
staggering
although
this
takes
some
mindfulness
and
a
willingness
to
brave
the
tannic
dry
bitterness
and
funk
that
pervades
the
proceedings
from
start
to

medium

the
beer
is
actually
quite
creamy
and
smooth
finish
is
bone
dry
and
the
whole
thing
makes
you
thirsty
truth
be
told
this
dryness
is
a
hallmark
of
an
orvalstyle
belgian
pale
though
this
brew
is
a
polarizer
with
some
considering
it
the
second
coming
while
others
decry
it
as
overrated
and
crude
the
truth
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
as
is
typically
the
case
rayon
vert
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
it
is
indeed
jagged
and
coarse
at
times
lacking
the
old
world
comeliness
of
orval
but
on
the
other
hand
i
can
also
appreciate
the
robust
flavors
and
unabashed
funkiness
drink
what
floats
your
boat
o
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
tarnish
an
otherwise
really
tasty
beer
still
somewhat
recommended
i
did
like
the
beer
overall
well
yes
its
a
belgian
ale
some
mix
of
bitter
light
sour
and
gueuze
carbonation
flew
too
high
on
this
one
the
funk
is
fun
and
dynamic
medicinal
part
kinda
off
but
overall
complex
and
interesting
one
o
i
bet
this
is
even
better
fresh
quite
good
for
the
probable
year
or
two
on
it
now
i
really
cant
wait
to
open
my
three
year
old
orval
o
the
brett
has
worked
wonders
on
this
complex
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
it
all
rounds
out
to
a
relatively
clean
beer
in
the
end
ill
get
this
again
o
i
enjoyed
rayon
vert
and
have
multiple
since
my
review
its
a
consistent
brew
that
push
the
bretty
yeast
across
the
palate
in
fashion
im
not
usually
big
on
brett
but
for
those
who
are
this
is
a
tremendous
ale
that
does
quite
nicely
at
what
its
called
for
you
always
get
well
crafted
ales
from
green
flash
and
ragon
vert
doesnt
disappoint
a
solid
belgian
style
pale
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
enjoy
this
ill
be
running
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
o
the
odd
astringent
bitterness
here
sort
of
ruined
the
experience
maybe
ill
revisit
again
and
hope
its
gone
overall
this
is
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
green
flash
it
bills
itself
as
an
orvalinspired
beer
and
ill
say
this
the
heavy
use
of
brett
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
wonderful
fresh
or
with
a
good
amount
of
age
on
it
definitely
put
it
in
the
same
company
with
orval
however
to
its
credit
it
is
a
different
and
interesting
beer
in
its
own
right
just
a
fantastically
imaginative
beer
from
gf
and
i
cant
really
think
of
anything
in
the
u
s
that
is
quite
like
itor
maybe
quite
like
it
and
as
good
drinkability
a
nice
beer
in
the
style
belgian
ale
close
to
orval
archetype
overall
a
very
nice
offering
from
green
flash
good
to
see
them
try
a
somewhat
unique
non
ipa
style
tasty
beer
poured
into

frothy

that

slightly

heavy

excellent
strong

mild

in
the
mouthfeel
as
expected
from
a
7
overall
a
pleasant
ale
that
i
would
recommend
and
sample
again
overall
i
can
say
this
is
a
high
quality
farmhouse
ale
and
definitely
one
that
is
more
experimental
and
funky
as
it
can
get
great
stuff
and
i
only
wish
it
werent
as
delicate
i
definitely
will
pick
some
of
these
up
and
cellar
them
in
the
future
my
only
fear
is
if
my
timing
goes
wrong
that
this
will
turn
into
a
smoky
bandaid
mayhem
rather
than
a
progressively
grassier
result
that
it
seems
destined
to
become
overall
beautiful
example
of
how
well
brett
works
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
the
base
beer
is
solid
and
the
wild
yeast
adds
layers
and
complexity
i
am
very
impressed

o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
the
flavor
of
this
pale
ale
was
the
worst
ive
had
from
green
flash
it
was
to
bitter
for
this
bitter
ale
and
the
flavor
was
over
bitter
with
a
vinal
taste
the
aftertaste
on
the
palate
was
way
to
bitter
with
that
vinal
flavor
what
happen
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
does
not
match
aroma
very
bubbly
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
and
dry
the
taste
is
bitter
and
lemony
with
a
huge
wash
of
spices
on
the
back
end
this
beer
has
a
very
eastern
feel
it
is
very
complex
i
almost
think
that
here
is
too
much
going
on
i
dont
say
this
much
but
i
feel
like
it
is
almost
over
done
sweetish
wheat
malt
up
front
soft
candied
tropical
fruit
notes
fill
in
slightly
metallic
minerally
herbal
hop
bitterness
comes
on
toward
the
end
somewhatfunky
yeast
throughout
providing
a
substantial
belgian
twang
juicier
fruits
in
the
finish
along
with
pepperier
spicier
hops
dries
out
a
bit
creamy
feel
in
a
medium
body
that
finishes
with
a
strong
undercurrent
of
carbonation
nice
the
brett
flavor
i
get
here
is
nice
but
not
quite
the
same
as
what
i
get
from
an
aged
bottle
of
orval
still
seeing
as
this
is
half
the
price
and
still
pretty
similar
its
a
good
option
orval
is
possibly
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
and
rayon
vert
is
a
good
homage
o
not
a
bad
job
at
all
very
drinkable
very
nicely
balanced
i
will
hit
this
again
o
rayon
vert
matches
the
sweet
orange
scent
and
taste
with
the
funky
yeasts
like
a
boss
the
hyper
active
head
is
a
layer
complete
and
separate
from
the
beer
like
the
icing
on
the
cake
the
combination
of
florals
and
fruits
with
just
a
little
hint
of
bretta
compliment
the
flavours
calling
out
the
best
of
each
element
a
delicious
offering
that
ill
most
certainly
seek
out
again
sublime
aroma
on
this
beer
its
like
funky
belgian
tropical
nirvana
hoppier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
the
flavors
seem
to
effortlessly
marry
together
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
o
this
beer
is
not
bad
it
is
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
given
other
reviews
it
is
a
perfectly
fine
belgian
ipa
but
if
you
want
a
bretty
ipa
that
smells
and
tastes
funky
look
for
anchorage
galaxy
white
ipa
mikkeller
farmhouse
invasion
ipa
or
grassrootsmikkeller
wheat
is
the
new
hops
edit
i
poured
the
dregs
in
halfway
through
and
it
was
glorious
i
would
get
a
four
pack
of
this
beer
and
drink
two
with
dregs
and
two
without
o
very
enjoyable
beer
better
than
i
expected
worth
checking
out
so
i
knew
this
would
be
overcarbed
but
this
was
stupid
it
took
a
pitcher
to
pour
this
12oz
bottle
nice
clear
golden
underneath
retained
none
of
the
foam
once
it
died
down
smells
nice
with
raisin
pale
belgian
yeast
character
some
hints
of
grain
and
metal
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
some
green
apple
skins
and
meat
come
through
as
it
warms
flavor
is
fruity
apple
lemon
honeydew
and
grain
some
clay
and
a
touch
of
strep
mutans
maybe
thats
my
mouth
though
medium
bodied
with
now
minimal
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
meh
would
like
to
try
fresh
because
this
didnt
do
well
with
the
age
imo
overall
this
was
tasty
it
didnt
wow
me
but
it
was
good
rayon
vert
pours
a
hazy
goldenrod
color
with
the
most
massive
head
we
have
ever
seen
the
bottle
conditioning
with
brettanoyces
creates
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
especially
when
aged
a
year
or
more
this
one
takes
time
to
pour
but
be
patient
the
wait
is
well
worth
it
an
impressive
bouquet
of
aromas
delight
the
senses
with
whiffs
of
lemon
zest
spices
belgian
yeast
and
funk
sweet
malt
flavors
reminiscent
of
bread
and
caramel
open
the
palate
to
more
subtle
notes
of
citrus
and
pepper
with
belgian
yeast
and
brettanomyces
funk
underlining
the
entire
brew
extremely
effervescent
this
green
flash
brew
is
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied

one
reviewer
thought
it
tasted
like
a
dirty
sock
i
wont
go
that
far
but
i
didnt
much
care
for
it
either
overall
tasty
belgian
pale
with
just
enough
funkiness
to
make
it
interesting
besides
the
superfoamy
head
its
a
really
great
drink
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
cloudy
caramel
color
that
is
opaque
and
unfiltered
tall
frothy
light
offwhite
head
that
laces
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
funk
with
notes
of
bubble
gum
all
spice
lavender
and
strawberry
lots
going
on
in
the
nose
on
this
one
flavors
are
roasty
and
sharp
with
a
caramel
and
bready
backbone
supporting
a
blending
of
spices
including
all
spice
clove
and
lemon
zest
the
palate
is
pretty
dynamic
and
there
are
more
and
more
flavor
profiles
as
you
drink
fruity
and
bready
aftertaste
with
a
light
slightly
filmy
finish
tasty
brew
its
right
up
there
with
other
top
belgian
pale
ales
and
thats
a
pretty
heavyhitting
list
a
top
notch
beer
in
any
category
o
as
spring
and
summer
comes
on
i
start
to
move
to
the
belgian
pale
ales
tripels
and
farmhouse
ales
i
just
found
this
one
here
in
texas
and
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
as
long
as
i
can
get
this
one
it
will
be
a
staple
in
these
warm
months
every
bit
as
enjoyable
as
some
of
the
belgian
ales
i
enjoy
o
its
a
tough
beer
to
rate
did
i
enjoy
it
yes
i
really
did
but
the
carbonation
was
just
too
overpowering
it
left
the
beer
unbalanced
and
it
became
the
focus
with
every
sip
i
really
liked
the
beer
a
lot
more
once
it
warmed
up
ill
leave
the
bottle
out
a
bit
before
drinking
the
next
one
in
fact
overall
its
pretty
good
but
definitely
not
amazing
8

for
4pk
o
one
of
the
better
stateside
belgian
pales
out
there
great
brett
character
and
extremely
solid
balance
with
just
the
right
touch
of
west
coast
hopping
standing
out
while
fitting
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
this
bottle
was
just
nearly
perfect
for
the
style
extravagant
softly
effervescent
sweetandtangy
and
bracingly
bitter
in
the
finish
i
have
stashed
several
bottles
in
the
cellar
along
with
orvals
and
other
brett
brews
including
many
of
my
own
making
i
have
no
doubt
this
one
will
continue
to
develop
more
character
and
complexity
for
the
next
couple
years
this
beer
tasted
like
it
was
brewed
with
dirty
socks
at
first
it
was
okay
but
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
unbearable
the
taste
became
it
tasted
more
like
some
kind
of
strange
bitter
hard
alcohol
than
a
beer
not
something
i
plan
on
buying
again
the
taste
may
not
be
100
agreeable
with
me
but
everything
else
is
well
done
green
flash
overall
an
interesting
belgianstyle
pale
ale
wellmade
not
for
everyone
but
a
must
try
the
beer
is
definitely
more
hoppy
than
your
typical
belgian
which
isnt
bad
at
all
but
not
my
preference
but
the
rather
piney
grassy
hops
mix
well
with
the
belgian
yeast
and
gives
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
a
touch
of
sugary
sweetness
from
out
of
nowhere
helps
that
ends
with
a
crisp
refreshing
experience
this
was
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
but
it
just
seemed
a
little
underwhelmingsimplistic
at
times
for
me
although
i
did
have
to
let
it
warm
since
the
idiot
bar
i
went
to
served
it
in
a
frozen
mug
and
called
it
a
triple
i
am
not
excluding
this
fact
as
it
may
have
killed
off
some
of
the
more
subtle
belgian
charateristics
and
ended
up
in
my
lower
score
o
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
interesting
and
complex
i
would
recommend
it
to
diehard
fans
of
belgian
sours
saisons
farmhouse
ales
or
just
interesting
beers
in
general
the
carbonation
seemed
overdone
which
makes
it
difficult
to
pour
the
beer
even
for
a
highly
carbonated
belgian
beer
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
but
i
dont
regret
buying
it
either
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
really
enjoy
it
i
heard
a
lot
about
it
from
one
of
my
friends
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
to
liqour
store
in
branson
a
little
surprising
condor
recommended
and
approved
very
interesting
beer
must
try
for
anyone
looking
for
a
readily
available
brett
fix
far
more
belgian
and
wild
than
san
diego
which
i
dont
expect
from
green
flash
hops
are
just
missing
really
even
as
a
belgian
pale
do
i
need
quite
so
much
brett
2nd
pour
was
much
more
densely
packed
definitely
lemon
meringue
pie
nonmoving
thick
head
decent
brew
good
belgian
and
easy
drinking
once
the
head
receded
a
bit
o
damn
this
is
delicious
definitely
my
favorite
green
flash
next
to
le
freak
i
think
they
should
do
more
belgians
since
theyre
obviously
so
good
at
it
oh
yes
i
will
drink
this
again
amazing
beer
maybe
gf
should
ditch
the
cali
hop
bomb
for
belgian
styles
cause
this
little
charmer
rocks
the
house
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
colossal
offwhite
foamy
uber
frothy
billowy
head
that
lasts
a
loooong
time
and
some
clingy
lace
color
is
a
clear
honey
amber
with
loads
of
small
bubble
trails
aroma
is
spice
herbal
yeast
fruit
malt
and
very
complex
flavors
similar
to
nose
bitter
and
tang
are
predominant
while
not
being
overdone
and
still
with
the
other
qualities
still
enticing
body
is
lively
a
tad
thin
but
still
good
finish
is
like
flavor
long
and
in
spite
of
boldness
quite
drinkable
world
class
beer
hope
to
try
it
on
draft
poured
a
beautiful
golden
hue
with
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
through
the
glass
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
that
had
to
be
left
to
settle
gorgeous
to
look
at
the
scent
was
mostly
the
brettanomyces
funk
barnyardhorse
scent
but
also
a
very
slight
hint
of
belgian
yeast
and
pine
the
flavor
again
is
dominated
by
brettanomyces
a
sour
funk
there
are
also
slight
hints
of
lemon
and
tastes
of
piney
hops
on
the
finish
and
aftertaste
its
odd
but
quite
pleasant
to
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
i
dont
feel
that
it
detracts
from
the
beer
in
any
way
and
rather
seems
to
help
it
while
i
could
due
with
a
slight
hint
more
malt
flavors
its
still
quite
good
and
is
a
nice
showcase
of
brettanomyces
and
belgian
yeast
which
i
enjoy
the
flavors
of
greatly
its
an
excellent
beer
and
id
have
it
again
d
almost
a
bolder
orval
without
the
sweet
candi
sugar
a
tasty
version
of
the
pale
with
a
touch
of
funk
o
i
enjoyed
rayon
vert
more
than
i
thought
i
would
as
i
usually
dont
like
brett
beer
very
much
at
all
i
would
still
pick
flying
dog
raging
bitch
over
this
in
a
headtohead
of
american
interpretations
of
belgian
styles
i
like
the
malt
and
hops
character
a
little
more
and
body
of
that
beer
a
lot
more
but
rayon
vert
is
a
brew
i
will
try
again
as
my
palate
continues
to
develop
as
it
does
serve
up
a
wondrous
number
of
aromas
and
flavors
bottom
line
good
taste
when
you
can
get
it
into
your
mouth
overall
a
pretty
great
beer
minus
the
mouthfeel
like
the
hoppy
with
belgian
character
combination
overall
an
enjoyable
belgian
pale
ale
by
green

the
fruitier
approach
worked
well
in
their
favour
looking
forward
to
trying
more
offerings
from
this
brewery

heres
a
belgian
pale
ale
done
right
one
of
the
best
american
versions
ive
ever
tasted
these
guys
know
what
theyre
doing
o
a
very
pleasant
beer
balancing
ease
of
drinking
with
depth
and
complexity
of
flavor
a
nice
bridge
between
hops
and
more
wild
grains
to
move
someone
on
from
lighter
styles
such
a
witbiers
to
more
interesting
european
ones
i
really
like
too
how
the
hops
serve
to
accentuate
and
spice
the
other
flavors
rather
than
overpowering

2013
a
bottle
i
was
getting
ready
for
a
quality
belgian
ale
what
i
got
was
an
exploding
head
that
tastes
like
off
yeast
and
dirt
and
the
distinct
impression
that
i
would
have
been
far
better
off
with
a
better
and
far
cheaper
alternative
such
as
leffe
grimbergen
kwak
or
gouden
carolus
a
truly
unimpressive
beer
oa
wonderfully
balanced
beer
imo
it
just
seems
extremely
well
crafted
and
thought
out
im
happy
i
grabbed
a
four
pack
and
will
be
back
for
more
if
the
chance
arises

here
it
is

and
has
a

almost
wish
it
were
a

more
simple
i
must
say
though
i
cannot
see
myself
ever
turning
this
one
down
rjt
on
the
fence
a
bit
with
this
beer
i
like
it
and
think
its
well
crafted
but
was
expecting
more
complexity
and
a
different
brett
profile
the
brett
funk
shows
some
massive
character
without
it
this
would
be
very
uninteresting
belgian
pale
good
summer
beer
worth
trying
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
get
acquainted
with
brettanomyces
im
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
one
im
usually
very
pleased
with
green
flash
but
this
one
just
hasnt
done
much
for
me
its
certainly
got
the
sour
funkiness
youd
expect
but
there
just
isnt
much
else
going
on
here
o
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
wasnt
the
holy
grail
of
beers
but
one
i
will
look
for
in
the
summer
really
drinkable
and
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
look
at
bottles
were
super
cool
and
retro
feeling
suds
out
the
door
after
the
pour
on
this

bitter

near

and
so
is
the

the
foaminess
only
mildly
irritating
brett
funk
is
here
but
well
balanced
throughout
i
think
a
good
ale
the
best
part
is
the
nose
o
an
interesting
west
coast
belgian
which
sports
a
melange
of
flavors
that
for
the
most
part
find
a
balance
at
times
the
brew
seems
busy
but
settles
to
a
nice
smoothness
as
you
adjust
to
the
palate
more
balanced

le
freak
rayon
vert
transplants
the
heart
of
a
belgian
into
the
body
of
a
california
ale
transfused
with
several
pints
of
brett
with
ample
love
and
nursing
this
brew
heralds
the
beginning
of
a
new
style
of
craft
beers
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
complexity
from
this
beer
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
poorly
made
geuze
might
have
to
revisit
this
sometime
o
wow
im
impressed
with
the
flavor
of
rayon
vert
need
to
find
some
in
a
nutshell
very
decent
belgian
style
pale
ale
with
brett
that
is
quite
delicious
when
you
can
manage
to
get
the
beer
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
your
glass
instead
of
on
the
counter
pour
is
a
dark
copper
mostly
transparent
with
an
off
white
tight
head
nose
is
light
leather
faint
dust
strong
lemon
and

with
a
lingering
leather
in
back
taste
is
very
good
dusty
and
leathery
bright
citrus
and
lemon
rather
bitter
and
semi
dry
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
decent
would
prefer
high
carb
but
not
bad
very
balanced
and
tasty
solid

aggressive

4

lots

barnyard
funk
slightly
citrus
toasty
bread
with
some
bitter

nice
budget
brett
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
also
a
light
with
a
fine
champagne
carbonation
adding
to
the
sizzle
and
zest
of
the
brew
unique
and
tasty
well
worth
trying
i
remain
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
anything
but
this
one
was
really
good
san
diego
swagger
meets
senne
valley
heritage
with
predictable
results
both
hold
up
quite
well
and
i
would
proffer
that
the
belgian
influence
wins
out
in
the
end
keeping
this
offering
from
edging
too
close
to
ipa
territory
belgian
or
otherwise
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
green
flash
lineup
i
am
not
much
of
a
funk
guy
but
this
is
well
played
its
overcarbonated
for
sure
it
took
three
delicate
pours
to
get
a
full
glass
the
hops
are
definitely
forward
which
i
see
as
a
plus
there
are
some
intense
herbs
throughout
like
sage
and
mint
i
dont
get
any
of
the
belgian
yeast
funk
that
i
would
expect
from
the
style
on
the
whole
i
enjoyed
this
beer
mostly
for
its
hoppiness
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
a
good
brett
beer
but
not
a
great
brett
beer
give
me
a
matilda
any
day
of
the
week
it
has
more
balance
and
complexity
still
not
bad
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
with
dense
rocky
white

settles
slowly
to
a

a

fairly
easy
drinking
use
of
brett
after
an
initial
reaction
simply
due
to
being
unacustomed
to
the
barnyard
brett
character
i
developed
a
great
liking
to
this
beer
a
very
nice
change
from
the
ipas
and
oktoberfests
ive
been
consuming
mass
quantities
off
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
and
carapils
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
hop
nose
and
a
wonderful
yeast
aroma
the
yeast
dominates
the
nose
and
provides
a
multitude
of
complexity
it
has
an
earthy
farmhouse
feel
with
hints
of
black
pepper
and
horse
hair
funk
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
it
goes
down
smooth
with
no
sign
of
an
elevated
alcohol
content
it
finishes
dry
and
funky
with
tons
of
yeast
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
excellent
yeast
character
its
complex
yet
incredibly
easy
drinking
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
cloudy

from

from
famous
in
lombard
a
bit
of
anticipation
bringing
it
to
my
nose
a
little
biscuit
a
little
citrus
a
little
unfamiliar
but
to
my
lips
the
taste
pushed
it
over
the
edge
all
you
brett
lovers
wont
have
to
worry
about
me
decreasing
the
world
wide
supply
of
beers
with
brett
it
could
be
top
notch
but
not
with
these
flavors
trying
to
be
open
minded
but
this
stuff
slams
the
door
shut
dare
i
say
not
a
repeat
sorry

flash
as
i
continue
to
sip
it

are
cut
through
with
the
high
carbonation
it
finishes
slightly
sweet
and
the
funk
lingers
a
little
the
carbonation
hurts
the
drinkability
on
this
one
but
its
still
very
good
and
worth
picking
up
only
a
few
months
age
in
this
bottle
from
when
i
bought
it
has
already
shown
changes
i
tried
one
fresh
when
i
bought
it
im
tempted
to
pick
up
some
more
to
age
for
at
least
6
months
or
a
year
that
said
i
still
despise
brett
although
not
always
my
first
choice
i
can
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
bpa
the
brett
addition
really
makes
this
beer
it
complements
the
fruityspicy
notes
from
the
yeast
extremely
well
a
delightful
belgian
ale
with
hop
notes
and
brett
well
balanced
and
eminently
drinkable
me
likey
d
not
one
for
every
day
not
tough
to
drink
but
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
bunch
in
a
row
an
interesting
beer
makes
me
want
to
explore
this
style
more
light
to
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
and
citrus
zest
aftertaste
a
really
nice
belgian
pale
ale
i
definitely
need
to
try
this
again
overall
this
one
is
pretty
tart
and
yeasty
with
strong
herbal
notes
that
dont
get
easier
to
drink
as
its
consumed
hurting

a
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
big
chewy
pile
of
eggshell
white
head
with
loads
of
chunky

the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
polite
herbaceous
clove
that
fights
back
the
hint
of
bubblegum
sweetness
intense
grain
and
the
herbal
hop
are
a
compelling
marriage
the
taste
brings
a
similar
effect
with

bubblegum
and
murky

the
herbal
near
mint
tea
blends
smoothly
with
the
stubborn

in

taste
the
beer
is

but
the
yeast

is
pronounced
and
gives
the
beer
a
greater

this
is

i

the

ehh
its
very
hoppy
which
is
to
be
expected
from
green
flash
its
peppery
and
citrusy
theres
also
yeast
and
mineral
as
usual
the
aroma
carries
into
the
flavor
and
theyre
very
similar
here
the
yeast
really
stands
out
with
its
mineral
and
leather
character
but
the
fruitiness
is
pretty
strong
as
well
additionally
given
the
fact
that
this
may
be
spiced
its
hard
to
tell
exactly
what
the
yeast
has
contributed
and
whats
coming
from
the
hops
and
the
spice
its
complex
but
at
the
same
time
its
the
same
complexity
all
the
way
through
still
its
an
interesting
and
bold
beer
that
you

i
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
is
the
type
of
brew
i
love
for
summer
full
of
flavor
and
character
that
demands
your
attention
yet
its
refreshing
and
simple
if
it
had
a
bit
more
depth
it
would
be
a
home
run
but
im
not
complaining
crisp
and
hoppy
a
really
nice
blend
of
classic
belgian
sweetness
and
spiciness
with
a
west

nothing
is
overwhelming
yet
the

feel

belgian
pale
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
certainly
appreciate
a
good
one
when
i
taste
it
and
thats
exactly
what
this
is
o
very
refreshing
and
unique
quite
a
bit
of
brett
character
yet
a
nice
hop
character
as
well
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
though
really
not
a
bad
beer
just
does
not
hit
any
style
buttons
for
anything
belgian
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
four
pack
will
be
drunk
but
this
is
not
what
i
am
going
to
reach
for
when
i
want
belgian
anything
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
is
a
challenging
drinker

the

overall
good

amazingly
great
aroma
but
the
body
is
greatly
lacking
in
comparison
to
the
strength
of
the
aroma
and
on
that
note
give
this
beer
a
try
d
a
very
nice
rather
assertive
belgian
ipa
a
home
run
in
terms
of
aroma
solidly
above
average
in
all
other
facets
definitely
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
tasty
and
something
i
would
gladly
drink
again
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
belgian
pale
ales
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beers
hybrid
qualities
rayon
vert
pours
a
bright
goldenorange
tone
with
a
couple
fingers
of
a
bright
white
head
its
nose
comes
across
with
citrus
brett
and
pine
a
very
nice
smell
to
be
sure
sipping
on
this
bpa
and
i
taste
lemons
belgian
yeast
coriander
and
some
light
hops
damn
this
beer
tastes
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
it
has
a
rather
lively
carbonation
to
it
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
that
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
have
found
it
to
be
tasty
fresh
and
also
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
o
this
is
pretty
decent
beer
very
unique
to
say
the
least
i
dont
know
how
old
my
bottle
is
and
if
this
beer
is
constantly
evolving
theres
no
telling
here
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
a
fresh
and
aged
one
side
by
side
just
to
see
the
difference
as
of
now
i
am
not
quite
sold
on
brett
dark
golden
color
great
head
very
bretty
and
funky
aroma
oooh
taste
starts
out
dry
and
then
the
funk
of
the
brett
hits
you
full
force
wow
age
has
done
this
beer
wonders
so
much
better
than
when
it
was
fresh
medium
carbonation
and
a
mild
body
great
o
a
wellmade
belgianstyle
ale
but
unique
enough
that
it
presents
its
own
merits
slightly
hoppier
and
less
smooth
than
the
orval
to
which
i
have
heard
it
compared
o
fantastic
so
full
of
brett
love
beautiful
bright
citrus
amazing
carbonation
and
im
finally
glad
i
got
around
to
trying
this
fantastic
brew
green
flash
has
spun
gold
with
rayon
vert
it
is
a
simple
yet
shape
shifting
beer
that
offers
a
balance
between
delicacy
and
density
i
wish
to
have
been
able
to
buy
more
bottles
to
track
the
changes
this
beer
is
sure
to
undergo
with
time
although
i
am
mightily
satisfied
having
tried
it
fresh
and
id
be
mighty
excited
to
try
it
again
bottle
very
true
to
the
style
nice
bit
of
funk
in
this
this
got
better
as
this
warmed
may
have
to
revisit
this
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
clear
golden
with
a
large
moderately
dissipating
white
head
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
and
side
of
the
glass
there
are
citrus
hop
aromas
as
well
as
brett
the
beer
smells
sweet
the
citrus
from
the
hops
comes
first
on
the
taste
but
this
quickly
followed
by
the
brett
the
brett
brings
that
nice
sour
flavor
the
malt
profile
is
there
bringing
some
sweetness
to
this
beer
that
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
profile
strongly
reminds
me
of
orval
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
wish
i
could
try
this
side
by
side
with
a
fresh
orval
for
a
proper
taste
comparison
jd
o
this
beer
has
created
some
heat
in
the
ba
forums
lately
despite
good
but
not
exceptional
scores
and
its
clear
why
rayon
vert
is
an
important
american
beer
sure
its
not
orvals
refined
perfection
but
its
a
californian
take
on
a
sort
of
uncategorizable
belgian
style
its
also
widely
available
for
about
2
50bottle
or
about
half
the
price
of
orval
and
most
other
brett
beers
i
cant
think
of
a
similar
american
beer
thats
available
in
four
or
sixpacks
o
fantastic
bpa
and
a
new
staple
in
my
fridge
for
a
style
that
i
think
is
very
easy
to
mess
up
green
flash
nails
it
while
entirely
different
this
is
every
bit
as
good
as
their
west
coast
ipa
poured
into
a
large
tulip
glass
a
hazed
peach
infused
light
golden
with
a
sticky
one
and
a
half
finger
white
head
atop
alot
of
citrus
fruit
in
the
nose
with
lighter
yeasty
spice
and
funk
notesthe
citrus
fruit
really
jumps
out
fresh
orange
lemony
citric
flavors
domante
the
flavor
profilerefreshing
and
sharplight
phenols
and
funky
brett
are
kept
in
check
pretty
wellthe
alcohol
provides
a
little
sweet
punch
as
it
warms
this
is
top
notch
and
dangerous
with
its
refreshing
citrusy
flavorsits
too
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
lots
of
character
it
throws
a
curb
ball
to
the
ipa
fueled
craft
beer
scene
freakin
excellent
stuff
balances
the
hops
and
brett
funk
perfectly
incredibly
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
really
great
yeast
and
brett
character
and
balance
throughout
overall
a
tasty
sour
beer
with
probably
one
of
the
best
aromas
of
a
beer
i
have
ever
smelt
one
i
would
go
to
again
given
the
chance
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
head
a
really
nice
brett
character
heavy
on
the
fruit
especially
apple
a
bit
of
pear
lots
of
straw
and
grass
and
a
mild
spice
some
bread
and
cracker
and
a
light
citric
quality
on
the
finish
the
flavor
is
slightly
tart
and
citrusy
with
lemon
and
lime
notes
light
tropical
fruit
character
as
well
as
some
pear
and
apple
good
bread
and
a
mild
spice
note
to
it
as
well
really
nice
taste
it
appears
the
californians
cant
control
them
selves
with
the
hops
this
is
listed
as
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
however
the
hops
are
really
bitter
and
in
your
face
not
saying
this
is
a
bad
thing
actually
this
is
quite
unique
very
tasty
beer
mouth
feel
is
very
bubbly
overall
this
is
a
great
surprise
from
a
producer
of
fine
west
coast
hop
nectar
beverages
my
wife
enjoyed
this
one
too
very
refreshing
as
the
12
ounces
disappeared
fast
i
would
recommend
rayon
vert
to
anyone
who
appreciates
funky
belgian
beer
kudos
to
green
flash
do
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
still
very
pleasantly
surprised
well
integrated
belgian
yeast
funkiness
with
just
enough
american
hop
presence
to
know
which
country
it
was
brewed
in
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
o
i
have
to
freely
admit
that
i
have
been
under
selling
green
flash
everytime
i
revisit
one
of
their
beers
i
am
impressed
now
that
they
have
found
their
way
to
the
east
coast
im
going
to
seek
them
out
rayon
vert
is
truly
great
belgian
ipa
if
you
dont
like
those
qualities
dont
drink
it
but
if
you
do
find
it
and
see
for
yourself
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
rayon
vert
is
what
i
drink
when
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
something
as
in
your
face
as
a
west
coast
ipa
another
good
beer
from
green
flash
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
had
this
in
a
pilsner
glass
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bit
of
lemon
curd
grapefruit
and
honeysuckle
on
the
palate
which
is
highlighted
by
a
much
more
citrus
driven
hop
characteristic
than
the
west
coast
ipa
good
solid
beer
for
hop
lovers
that
arent
looking
to
take
a
nap
after
putting
down
a
big
ipa
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
quite
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
would
expect
from
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
quite
tasty
color
me
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
o
very
tasty
beer
would
certainly
by
in
a
four
pack
again
a
great
beer
if
served
warmer
to
bring
everything
thats
available
in
this
beer
a
nice
sipping
pa
it
pours
rather
uneven
and
the
feel
is
rather
distracting
at
times
but
the
aroma
is
great
and
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
and
rewarding
cheers
o
a
really
good
beer
and
worth
trying
if
you
like
brett
i
would
like
to
how
this
ages
definitely
will
buy
this
again
one
of
the
few
beers
that
have
inspired
m
to
write
a
review
in
a
while
get
some
if
you
can
this
might
be
better
than
duvel
honestly
the
huge
head
filled
my
glass
all
the
way
but
the
body
is
that
cloudy
yellow
i
love
the
smell
is
all
lemon
grass
and
lemon
peel
all
the
way
i
get
a
nice
hint
of
funk
as
well
it
honestly
reminds
me
of
sanctification
very
light
body
and
very
grassy
with
a
hint
of
funk
light
body
and
very
drinkable
i
love
this
beer
and
its
my
top
bpa
overall
another
brewery
that
can
do
no
wrong
ive
enjoyed
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
and
this
one
is
no
different
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
the
flavours
compliment
each
other
well
o
a
pretty
good
effort
like
all
the
green
flash
offerings
ive
tried
its
a
relatively
uncomplex
flavor
or
i
would
have
bumped
up
to
an
overall
4
instead
of
3
5
but
its
a
close
call
o
would
buy
this
again
a
good
one
to
try
if
you
want
to
experience
brett
flavor
thats
not
overwhelming
o
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
beers
that
have
brett
added
to
them
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
this
is
a
great
sipping
beer
and
one
that
i
could
enjoy
all
evening
long
i
found
this
one
real
easy
to
drink
and
would
happily
get
it
again
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
brewery
pulling
off
a
belgian
pale
with
brett
character
the
brett
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
or
any
of
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
solid
job
by
gf
here
o
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
it
seemed
too
hoppy
for
the
style
and
the
intense
carbonation
made
it
a
pain
to
drink
o
a
nice
beer
not
the
best
beer
but
a
really
affordable
wild
ale
just
a
bit
too
overpowering
on
the
brett
but
nice
and
drinkable
and
complex
smell
is
awesome
taste
is
a
little
too
repetitive
though
worth
a
shot
if
you
have
never
tried
it
or
are
looking
for
widely
availablecheap
wild
alessours
overall
im
very
much
digging
this
beer
will
buy
this
beer
again
o
very
impressed
drinks
very
well
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
the
brett
adds
nicely
to
it
might
be
one
for
aging
if
this
was
available
to
me
it
would
be
the
kind
of
beer
id
by
cases
of
o
decent
beer
you
have
to
appreciate
an
offthe
shelf
brett
beer
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
it
its
not
my
favorite
but
id
buy
another
4pack
down
the
road
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
big
white
head
that
takes
a
while
to
settle
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
with
green
apple
and
apricot
a
bit
of
brett
and
some
breadiness
initial
taste
is
some
green
apple
and
apricot
a
bit
of
brett
presence
finish
is
bready
and
slightly
drying
quite
nice
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
id
be
curious
to
see
how
this
evolves
but
not
sure
if
i
have
the
space
will
probably
buy
again
but
mostly
for
the
amazing
aroma
for
anyone
who
sees
this
and
is
thinking
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
style
i
love
orval
just
not
the
price
tag
o
this
is
a
really
pleasant
beer
to
sip
and
savor
and
the
addition
of
brett
really
makes
the
taste
very
interesting
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
and
would
even
consider
getting
a
large
bomber
or
two
to
age
o
very
unique
but
a
bit
too
intense
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
this
needs
to
be
tamed
its
clean
and
crisp
but
really
it
does
a
poor
job
of
the
style
and
even
on
its
own
terms
it
feels
empty
and
pointless
no
not
a
great
brew
overall
taste
is
all
about
the
brett
which
is
fine
if
you
are
into
that
sort
of
thing
there
really
is
very
little
base
beer
aspects
that
are
notable
maybe
a
kiss
of
herbal
hops
on
the
finish
along
with
a
frontal
granola
grain
aspect
and
that
is
reaching
if
you
want
a
brettbomb
this
is
your
beer
i
want
to
say
that
if
you
like
orval
this
beer
will
appeal
to
you
but
i
dont
think
this
is
as
well
put
together
tastes
about
the
same
as
it
smells
only
the
medicinal
nodes
are
slightly
more
pronounced
and
theres
a
small
hint
of
brett
that
wasnt
present
in
the
aroma
fruity
up
front
lightly
sour
in
the
back
and
then
woody
and
hoppy
near
in
the
end
its
all
great
aside
from
that
one
off
node
which
makes
the
aftertaste
a
little
offputting
overall
i
havent
really
liked
the
belgian
ipas
and
this
is
not
a
great
rendition
of
one
watery
subdued
i
didnt
pick
up
much
brett
a
little
came
out
as
it
warmed
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
thank
you
green
flash
o
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
a
solid
nofrills
pale
ale
with
a
nice
brett
infusion
the
funk
may
require
a
little
getting
used
to
but
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
for
drinkers
unfamiliar
with
brett
beers
tastes
like
olive
brine
drain
cleaner
and
perfume
all
mixed
together
slight
funk
probably
from
a
souring
bacteria
or
wild
yeast
and
a
heavy
phenolic
presence
i
associate
with
infected
homebrew
those
flavors
combine
with
the
massive
hopping
to
create
an
artificial
perfumeychemical
aroma
and
flavor
its
interesting
and
tastes
better
if
you
keep
trying
and
get
used
to
it
but
it
never
gets
past
horribly
infected
to
me
o
unlike
any
belgian
pale
ale
i
have
ever
experienced
unfortunately
this
wont
be
for
everyone
but
for
those
wishing
to
expand
their
palate
or
fans
of
geuze
beers
this
is
definitely
one
to
seek
out
o
really
nice
offering
o
so
i
came
into
this
having
had
a
few
of
their
belgian
offerings
grand
cru
and
le
freak
come
bo
mind
but
for
whatever
reason
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
and
now
i
know
i
was
sadly
mistaken
this
is
awesome
o
a
very
interesting
beer
not
at
all
like
i
was
expecting
hard
to
classify
it
very
good
i
think
i
would
enjoy
it
the
more
i
have
it
will
try
it
again
an
extraordinary
american
version
of
a
distinctly
belgian
style
o
a
slow
sipper
for
me
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
enjoy
much
or
am
likely
to
pick
up
again
i
can
see
how
others
would
like
it
though
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
drinks
well
and
combines
funky
and
hoppy
notes
will
be
picking
this
up
again
if
you
dont
like
funk
you
wont
like
this
beer
wild
ale
fans
seek
it
out
had
a
very
subtle
taste
of
hops
and
a
nice
citrus
appeal
to
it
once
again
green
flash
impressed
me
m
fairly
crisp
upfront
frothy
on
the
hold
with
a
slippery
texture
and
midrange
body
sour
musky
fade
the
brettanomyces
yeast
truly
stands
out
and
may
not
be
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
overshadows
what
little
hoppiness
it
has
lots
of
barnyard
funk
and
love
the
strong
belgian
yeast
an
aspect
many
american
breweries
tend
to
shy
away
from
this
embraces
it
and
doesnt
hold
back
youll
either
love
it
because
of
the
yeast
or
be
turned
off
o
a
fine
bpa
and
one
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
green
flash
flair
with
a
hopped
out
profile
and
7
abv
drinkable
and
flavorful
but
not
crazy
about
the
horseblanket
aroma
that
i
cant
quite
identify
outside
of
the
circus
smell
for
yourself
but
ill
breathe
before
i
sip
for
now
o
i
really
like
this
but
could
see
its
not
for
everybody
very
enjoyable
but
probably
not
all
night
drinker
im
curious
to
see
how
this
ages
pours
a
murky
golden
copper
color
with
a
lofty
foamy
off
white
head
that
kept
growing
the
aroma
consists
of
some
lemon
vinegar
nice
and
funky
with
some
grassy
notes
it
tastes
of
bitter
lemon
peels
with
just
a
slight
sourness
lots
of
citrus
peel
grass
ad
belgian
yeast
the
beer
is
pretty
light
bodied
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
metallic
finish
i
think
this
beer
will
really
develop
with
some
age
seemed
quite
raw
at
this
point
still
good
though
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
has
a
fair
amount
of
minerals
in
the
smell
and
taste
the
sour
background
is
like
a
ripening
cheese
its
a
beautiful
beer
with
a
fluffy
crackling
head
o
its
appearance
right
down
to
the
stylin
bottle
was
its
strongpoint
for
me
followed
by
the
aroma
i
found
the
taste
a
little
bland
and
the
aftertaste
phenolically
clawing
if
you
like
greenflash
and
youre
curious
about
their
take
on
a
bpa
give
it
a
shot
o
excellent
beer
i
was
surprised
by
this
not
knowing
what
i
was
getting
into
price
point
was
about
3
per
12
ounce
bottle
where
i
go
to
get
ripped
off
ive
had
quite
a
few
american
takes
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
but
this
was
probably
the
juiciest
version
that
ive
had
yet
as
i
dont
really
think
that
i
gave
those
citrusy
hops
enough
credit
here
in
this
review
the
spiciness
here
wasnt
overdone
either
and
helped
add
an
extra
zippy
layer
of
attitude
to
this
well
done
green
flash
this
is
one
that
i
will
be
returning
to
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
funky
barnyard
notes
with
dry
hoppy
notes
with
light
floral
undertones
taste
is
a
wonderful
mix
between
some
brett
notes
with
its
characteristics
barnyard
notes
which
are
well
integrated
with
the
dry
hoppy
notes
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
is
not
overly
sweet
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
great
balance
between
the
different
aspects
of
this
beer
while
retaining
some
very
good
drinkability
overall
seemingly
green
flashs
take
on
orval
very
refreshing
with
its
bright
tart
funkiness
it
has
developed
quite
nicely
over
the
last
year
the
live
yeast
taking
on
a
more
acerbic
tone
the
pineapple
forward
yeast
definitely
makes
me
wish
that
this
was
100
fermented
with
brettanomyces
ala
russian
rivers
sanctification
rather
than
just
bottle
conditioned
with
it
this
is
still
a
wonderful
example
of
a
refreshing
funky
beer
id
definitely
recommend
drinking
this
on
a
hot
day
othis
isnt
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
maybe
get
it
again
at
some
point
if
you
want
a
good
pale
belgian
just
get
one
from
belgium
rayon
vert
pours
a
nearly
opaque
burnt
orange
lightening
a
fair
bit
along
the
edges
when
backlit
the
fluffy
white
head
tops
out
at
more
than
four
fingers
worth
of
foam
and
shows
pretty
good
retention
lacing
is
noticeably
weak
compared
to
some
of
its
authentic
belgian
brethren
the
nose
is
both
aromatic
and
complex
the
brett
quickly
jumps
out
as
i
inhale
surprisingly
potent
for
a
relatively
young
bottle
theres
lots
of
wet
hay
and
lemon
juice
with
some
light
pepper
and
horse
blanket
present
as
well
hops
do
a
beautiful
job
of
filling
in
the
gaps
lending
both
herbal
and
light
tangerinegrapefruit
citrus
aromas
the
flavor
manages
to
follow
through
on
just
about
all
the
promise
of
the
nose
delivering
lots
of
funk
buttressed
by
some
well
chosen
hops
those
same
hops
though
provide
a
touch
too
much
bitterness
and
it
just
becomes
abrasive
against
the
delicate
balance
of
flavors
otherwise
present
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
with
a
dry
and
crisp
body
and
carbonation
thats
sneaky
in
how
bubbly
it
is
rayon
vert
is
a
close
domestic
substitute
for
orval
and
thats
pretty
high
praise
stupid
good
for
the
price
i
think
i
have
found
my
funky
sour
go
to
anchorage
does
it
a
bit
better
but
at
this
price
i
will
be
buying
rayon
vert
4
packs
and
passing
by
the
16
bottles
ranks
up
there
with
ones
from
belgium
wow
vigorous
pour
loads
of
carbonation
creamy
long
lasting
head
nose
is
incredibly
assertive
with
wild
bready
notes
brett
and
spices
very
carbonated
and
tickly
on
the
palate
with
abundance
of
wild
bretty
flavors
incredibly
silky
smooth
this
beer
tastes
almost
exactly
like
my
first
attempt
at
brewing
a
wild
ale
the
style
is
defined
here
as
belgian
pale
ale
though
with
a
brett
yeast
that
asserts
itself
pretty
heavily
this
beer
is
more
than
a
pale
dry
musty
musky
aroma
and
flavor
woody
earthy
maybe
some
mushroommineral
quality
not
a
sweet
beer
at
all
for
those
of
you
who
are
looking
for
something
thats
heavy
on
malts
my
only
complain
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
little
thin
but
otherwise
for
10
a
4
pack
at
whole
foods
this
beer
is
a
steal
ive
had
green
flash
belgians
before
where
the
yeast
just
didnt
match
the
malt
profile
but
this
one
is
spot
on
tastes
like
it
should
be
drunk
standing
next
to
a
wooden
barrel
probably
after
stabling
the
horses
o
very
delicious
beer
with
the
perfect
blend
between
funk
and
earthinessfruit
this
is
a
great
take
on
orval
a
neat
and
welcome
addition
to
the
green
flash
fleetpicked
this
up
at
brawleysparticularly
since
the
west
coast
ipa
went
the
way
of
wood
left
rotting
with
the
pursuit
of
the
4pack
anybody
else
feel
similar
slippage
since
they
made
that
changereally
an
ingredient
difference
ive
only
seen
it
once
on
that
most
recent
pilgrimage
to
brawleys
but
ill
definitely
pick
up
another
foursome
if
and
when
i
see
it
again
this
second
one
of
the
four
is
growing
on
me
not
outstanding
but
interestingly
complex
and
fairly
enjoyable
this
beer
is
outstanding
balanced
with
citrus
funk
and
malt
with
a
lasting
white
head
and
a
smell
of
floral
funky
bliss
the
body
is
crisp
but
still
full
for
a
brett
beer
this
is
the
perfect
springsummerany
time
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
green
flashs
best
effort
well
done
overall
an
interesting
beer
the
herbal
musty
funk
reminds
me
of
orval
however
i
like
this
much
more
than
orval
definitely
off
the
beaten
path
a
must
try
a
nice
american
version
of
a
traditional
belgian
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
this
beer
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
i
would
seek
this
one
out
for
sure
i
enjoyed
it
edit
had
it
three
times
since
and
i
can
say
this
is
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
genius
conception
and
expert
execution
in
this
one
a
beer
to
drop
your
jaw
at
o
its
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
but
good
for
the
style
not
a
bad
choice
to
try
if
you
like
belgians
give
this
a
try
once
i
added
the
yeast
sediment
a
bit
more
flavor
came
out
pears
a
bit
of
funk
but
there
was
also
some
phenolic
flavors
that
were
somewhat
offputting
still
too
bitter
for
me
a
good
beer
and
definitely
the
most
affordable
brett
beer
out
there
im
curious
to
see
how
this
one
tastes
in
a
year
or
two
o
a
really
nice
blend
of
west
coast
american
style
with
belgian
styles
really
refreshing
great
with
lots
of
food
and
cheese
i
will
return
rayon
vert
is
an
good
study
in
palate
desensitization
andor
acclimation
i
started
off
hating
it
then
didnt
mind
it
quite
as
much
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
find
myself
tired
of
it
i
wouldnt
be
inclined
to
drink
this
again
the
aroma
takes
the
mind
to
the
country
side
the
feeling
and
smells
of
a
farm
come
to
mind
and
the
rustic
nature
of
the
beer
comes
to
life
with
earthy
hops
backing
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
smae
as
the
aroma
i
get
hardy
grain
and
spring
pollen
a
slight
bright
citrus
lime
flavor
coming
through
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
over
carbonation
is
covering
up
the
body
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
that
keeps
you
guessing
if
you
like
orval
you
will
like
this
good
stuff
big
head
that
initially
fills
a
quarter
of
the
glass
very
fine
and
delicate
foam
of
eggshell
white
much
better
retention
than
expected
albeit
with
minimal
stickiness
to
the
lacing
cloudy
liquid
with
a
strong
orange
rust
metallic
coloration
perhaps
a
light
brown
tint
while
more
yellow
at
the
rims
loosely
assembled
but
large
bubbles
rise
swiftly
throughout
yeast
flowers
orange
peel
wheat
germ
apples
and
pears
comprise
most
of
the
nose
some
earthiness
but
not
really
as
funky
as
one
might
expect
good
density
but
lacks
staying
power
fullbodied
here
in
the
mouth
its
creamy
and
bottom
heavy
sinks
deeply
into
the
palate
develops
a
peppery
kick
as
well
as
added
grassiness
supports
the
tartness
of
the
orange
lemon
citrus
and
clove
vague
minerally
aspect
but
again
clean
on
the
whole
dry
the
pear
peach
apple
fruit
feels
cellar
dried
most
of
the
sweet
juiciness
gone
manages
to
not
appear
overtly
hoppy
nor
malty
minimal
breadiness
or
doughiness
the
citrus
outlasts
the
rest
more
interesting
than
pleasurable
little
is
casual
about
it
o
for
me
this
beer
is
controversial
its
complexity
confuses
others
have
mentioned
this
beer
is
a
homage
to
the
mighty
orval
there
certainly
are
parallels
however
it
does
not
have
the
complexity
of
orval
for
this
style
this
beer
truly
delivers
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
very
nice
o
a
very
nice
take
on
a
brett
beer
its
not
as
balanced
as
orval
but
i
like
the
way
it
is
more
hopped
up
both
fruitwise
and
bitterwise
mo
medium
body
with
great
carbonation
the
brett
definitely
turns
this
beer
into
something
very
good
and
green
flash
pulled
it
off
well
slightly
velvetlike
on
the
palate
and
finishes
semidry
but
aftertaste
fades
quickly
for
94pack
its
not
a
bad
deal
an
affordable
brettbeer
that
doesnt
suck
light
body
with
some
expansive
carbonation
lingers
on
the
pallet
nicely
overall
this
one
is
pretty
enjoyable
a
nice
west
coast
take
on
some
a
belgian
style
overall
this
is
very
good
beer
and
surprising
in
the
potency
and
balancing
effect
of
the
hops
setting
this
brew
firmly
aside
from
most
of
the
belgian
ales
personally
i
find
the
hops
a
great
addition
and
think
more
beers
of
this
style
should
follow
suit
the
beer
is
still
wellbalanced
even
with
the
hops
the
7
0
abv
does
come
out
a
bit
giving
the
brew
vodkalike
alcoholic
vapors
and
the
sourness
is
slightly
strange
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
great
fare
worth
trying
overall
a
good
beer
in
a
style
that
i
havent
had
much
of
the
flavor
of
the
brett
takes
a
bit
to
get
used
to
but
is
enjoyable
this
is
a
really
fantastic
beer
and
im
beyond
excited
that
its
year
round
this
is
finally
an
offtheshelf
yearround
beer
that
is
worthy
of
sitting
beside
sixers
of
two
hearted
in
my
fridge
bravo
green
flash
o
if
their
plan
was
a
homage
to
orval
i
think
they
did
them
justice
its
a
solid
brew
for
sure
just
like
orval
the
earlier
you
get
it
the
more
hops
youll
get
the
later
the
more
brett
you
should
pull
id
be
interested
to
see
what
this
one
tastes
like
down
the
road
for
me
this
beer
is
almost
like
a
hybrid
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
geuze
it
has
a
stony
dryness
that
is
reminiscent
of
duvel
yet
also
has
a
slight
sour
geuzelike
note
to
it
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
appetizing
and
dry
and
the
price
is
not
prohibitive
sadly
since
i
havent
yet
tried
an
extensive
variety
of
belgianstyle
beers
i
feel
that
the
novelty
of
this
beer
with
its
use
of
brett
is
a
bit
wasted
on
me
i
shall
have
to
try
it
again
after
ive
had
an
opportunity
to
experience
a
few
more
beers
o
this
is
my
second
green
flash
beer
either
my
taste
buds
are
uneducated
or
something
is
a
miss
for
me
with
this
brewery
could
it
be
brett
only
asking
as
i
have
not
had
that
style
there
is
an
aftertaste
here
that
i
am
simply
not
a
fan
of
oh
i
should
have
bought
more
this
tastes
like
not
fresh
but
somewhat
young
orval
for
the
creeping
brett
character
right
now
it
provides
a
gentle
tang
and
is
beginning
to
roll
over
the
mild
caramel
malt
taste
and
belgian
spice
i
mean
its
clearly
a
brett
beer
theres
the
trademark
horsey
farmhouse
funk
but
it
hasnt
overun
the
ale
yet
very
cool
beer
admirably
balanced
for
an
american
craft
brewer
ive
had
too
many
failed
attempts
at
sours
by
domestic
breweries
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
at
its
most
complex
yet
but
still
check
it
out
this
is
a
very
cool
beer
o
i
wish
theyd
bottle
date
i
get
the
feeling
my
bottle
isnt
really
that
fresh
thats
probably
the
only
thing
stopping
me
from
buying
more
in
the
future
probably
by
the
case
otherwise
this
is
drinkable
refreshing
and
affordably
priced
a
real
winner
from
green
flash
sure
to
appeal
to
fans
of
brett
beers
overall
a
very
nicely
done
belgian
pale
with
brett
a
bit
too
much
hops
bitterness
detracts
a
bit
from
the
flavor
and
the
overall
enjoyment
but
very
well
done
ill
definitely
get
this
again
its
also
a
good
cheap
way
to
show
someone
what
brett
smellstastes
like
o
crisp
refreshing
and
yeasty
very
balanced
and
flavorful
showing
some
subtle
wild
ale
characteristics
an
excellent
value
a
4pack
was
about
12
in
pa
this
is
just
excellent
for
the
brett
lover
o
this
is
fantastic
beer
as
ive
certainly
come
to
expect
from
green
flash
really
like
america
meets
a
dupontorval
collab
very
well
done
i
liked
this
a
lot
at
94pack
its
a
true
steal
this
day
and
age
ive
seen
a
ton
worse
for
10750
ml
thats
for
sure
this
is
just
really
good
beer
golden
orange
with
a
massive
white
head
only
slight
lacing
a
sweet
and
funky
smell
sugary
lemon
hay
and
some
pepper
flavor
starts
off
with
some
lemon
and
apple
that
leads
into
some
tartness
some
pepper
and
sugared
hay
funky
crisp
medium
bodied
to
this
a
nice
brew
for
sure
the
funkiness
to
this
certainly
adds
a
uniqueness
to
the
style
they
do
it
well
but
not
sure
i
prefer
this
approach
to
the
usual
the
mouthfeel
was
very
zesty
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
with
plant
of
carbonation
overall
really
an
exceptional
beer
i
can
see
why
the
brewers
at
green
flash
were
excited
to
release
it
and
i
hope
its
successful
will
pick
up
more
if
i
see
it
in
boston
or
nyc
i
would
like
to
try
the
beer
again
in
a
blind
tasting
perhaps
with
an
open
mind
i
might
have
a
different
tasting
experience
but
for
me
it
doesnt
rank
among
the
better
belgian
pales
and
it
certainly
doesnt
compare
to
orval
o
probably
the
most
authentic
belgian
beer
that
i
have
tried
out
of
the
u
s
and
there
have
been
so
many
let
downs
highly
carbed
fluffy
refreshing
a
better
orval
knockoff
than
say
russian
river
damnation
something
i
will
return
to
o
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
green
flash
offering
the
aroma
and
taste
were
phenomenal
it
has
the
bite
of
a
bpa
with
a
bit
of
saison
funkinesstartness
the
flavors
melded
well
and
it
has
an
impressively
refreshing
character
for
a
7
beer
great
for
a
hot
day
i
will
certainly
get
this
again
nice
refreshing
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
even
with
a
gentle
pour
an
enormous
fluffy
white
head
forms
immediately
and
lingers
with
the
amber
beer
the
liquid
is
fairly
hazy
even
taking
care
not
to
disturb
the
yeast
the
nose
is
brett
horsey
some
hay
brett
and
barnyard
dominate
the
front
of
the
flavor
profile
too
followed
by
a
light
pear
or
green
apple
the
finish
is
exceptionally
dry
with
a
bit
of
grain
its
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
quenching
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
nice
od
weird
mouthfeel
and
less
sourness
than
the
aroma
if
those
issues
werent
there
this
would
be
a
really
nice
beer
good
but
lacking
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
i
guess
for
an
ipa
with
belgian
tendencies
its
dry
and
lively
with
carbonation
it
works
overall
though
this
is
a
beer
in
need
of
some
refinement
its
reasonably
tasty
but
it
mimics
orval
without
capturing
its
true
refinement
and
magic
its
probably
the
best
american
attempt
at
capturing
orval
for
what
its
worth
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
really
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
find
the
style
very
intriguing
there
is
a
great
deal
of
complexity
in
general
and
this
ale
does
not
disappoint
in
that
regard
smells
of
pepper
and
spice
mostly
light
hints
of
sweet
honey
like
malt
countered
with
grapefruit
and
zest
taste
is
spicy
with
pepper
lightly
sweet
with
honey
like
malt
lemony
and
citrusy
with
hops
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
fizzy
syrupy
chalky
mouthfeel
decent
belgian
pale
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
orange
with
some
lighter
browns
scattered
in
the
body
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
and
some
splotchy
lacing
nose
has
some
dill
underripe
citruscitrus
zest
pale
malts
and
some
spicing
thats
somewhat
sharp
in
nature
good
sweet
balance
however
taste
has
more
dill
citrus
zest
some
mild
belgian
yeast
notesspicing
grainy
pale
malts
light
flavour
but
subtle
and
complex
drying
with
a
hint
of
tartness
in
the
finish
flavourful
gentle
and
interesting
a
nice
complex
belgian
pale
thats
quite
easy
to
consume
something
id
revisit
nice
beer
to
drink
refreshing
for
hot
days
enough
going
on
to
drink
whenever
seems
to
execute
well
what
it
set
about
to
do
pours
a
hazy
golden
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
a
touch
of
farmhouse
funkpeachesblackberrieswhite
grapes
and
grassy
herbal
hops
and
i
find
the
brett
really
dominates
the
aromathe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
abit
overcarbonated
with
tastes
of
peachesfarmhouse
funkbready
malts
and
finished
with
a
bittersweet
finish
of
herbal
hops
and
candy
and
overall
its
nice
and
very
drinkable
but
not
really
something
for
special
occasions
just
a
solid
session
beer
for
me
cheers
o
this
beer
is
well
brewed
and
is
a
nice
venture
to
a
style
not
seen
very
often
in
the
u
s
that
i
know
of
so
far
coming
from
green
flash
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
nicely
done
overall
blown
away
by
this
a
really
wellconceived
orval
tribute
and
an
instant
classic
coming
from
green
flash
i
expected
this
to
be
much
hoppier
not
a
complaint
though
it
goes
easy
on
the
brettiness
and
hops
while
still
remaining
interesting
and
tasty
carbonation
is
a
little
full
on
for
my
liking
d
the
brett
yeast
is
a
bit
soft
compared
to
what
i
expected
though
i
still
enjoyed
the
aroma
taste
really
didnt
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
massive
white
head
steadily
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
with
nice
lace
aroma
has
a
soft
funky
brett
presence
with
light
fruit
belgian
yeast
and
spice
enjoyed
this
after
it
warmed
up
and
carbonation
died
down
a
little
bit
sweet
fruit
and
malt
blend
with
earthy
and
funky
saison
like
notes
for
a
refreshing
balanced
bpa
very
exciting
to
see
this
year
round
overall
i
think
this
one
tastes
a
lot
like
boulevards
saisonbrett
which
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
year
and
the
fact
that
this
is
so
available
and
you
can
lay
some
down
to
let
the
brett
develop
more
is
amazing
pair
this
one
with
some
whole
milk
bleu
cheese
or
gorgonzola
and
you
are
in
heaven
this
is
fantastic
top
5
of
the
year
so
far
overall
nice
bold
experiment
here
the
tastes
dont
work
especially
well
togethe
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
as
something
different
o
this
beer
is
awesome
and
i
could
see
it
being
really
awesome
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
nice
tart
citrus
funk
very
well
done
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
it
had
a
nice
balance
between
the
brett
and
the
citrusy
hops
it
was
crisp
and
clean
with
some
really
nice
flavors
the
brett
was
well
done
as
well
very
good
beer
overall
and
a
very
impressive
american
version
of
a
classic
style
very
refreshing
definitely
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
tasty
interesting
and
fulfilling
beer
id
have
this
again
and
again
overall
a
decent
beer
not
terribly
complex
drinkability
is
high
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
allows
this
to
be
pleasantly
fizzy
but
generally
smooth
and
clean
finish
is
quite
dry
with
slight
stickiness
from
perhaps
malt
probably
my
favorite
green
flash
beer
layers
of
complexity
extremely
drinkable
and
super
refreshing
this
could
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
reminds
me
of
orval
o
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
thats
well
made
and
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeyellow
color
with
a
comically
big
head
even
when
paired
carefully
this
combined
with
the
very
high
level
of
carbonation
creates
a
fantastic
looking
beer
easily
as
good
looking
as
a
duvel
the
aroma
is
a
solid
amount
of
spice
and
belgian
yeast
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
american
backbone
the
taste
is
solid
with
the
funky
brett
contributing
quite
a
bit
to
the
flavor
it
interacts
nicely
with
the
citrus
hop
profile
often
associated
with
an
american
ipa
without
quite
becoming
the
flavor
mishmash
often
referred
to
on
this
site
as
a
belgian
ipa
its
quite
complex
with
peppery
and
yeasty
flavors
contributing
to
the
overall
effect
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
carbonated
and
goes
down
easily
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
one
of
the
better
belgian
pales
ive
had
im
really
not
fond
of
the
style
in
general
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
cinnamon
and
a
fruity
yeast
in
the
taste
green
apples
and
a
cinnamon
like
spice
a
spice
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
green
apple
skin
and
cinnamon
in
the
aftertaste
quite
apple
like
big
cinnamon
spice
yet
very
nice
o
a
great
american
interpretation
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
but
a
ballsy
move
for
green
flash
a
funky
belgian
pale
released
yearround
in
four
packs
that
is
a
swift
departure
from
the
hoppy
west
coast
stuff
that
dominates
the
rest
of
their
yearround
portfolio
it
takes
most
people
a
little
while
to
warm
up
to
funk
i
love
the
idea
of
a
readilyavailable
and
walletfriendly
funky
belgian
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
the
average
american
craft
beer
drinker
will
receive
it
o
decent
beer
would
probably
drink
again
not
overly
impressive
but
good
enough
to
drink
if
i
needed
something
differnt
this
brew
from
green
flash
lives
up
to
their
standards
nice
pour
with
a
beautiful
head
that
smells
of
citronella
and
lemon
the
taste
also
has
notes
of
citronella
and
citrus
fruits
with
a
pleasant
bodymouthfeel
this
beer
was
perfect
for
an
80
degree
day
on
the
1st
of
march
2012
good
finish
o
overall
ive
never
seen
or
heard
of
this
beer
but
liked
it
quite
a
bit
i
thought
the
body
was
great
and
the
taste
was
really
nice
with
a
good
mix
of
brett
citrus
and
fruit
glad
to
have
another
bottle
of
it
overall
not
bad
but
as
ive
said
it
certainly
tastes
like
an
americanized
beer
with
nowhere
near
the
complexity
of
the
brew
i
think
its
trying
to
mimic
that
said
though
this
is
certainly
a
candidate
for
the
cellar
and
its
ageability
gives
it
a
few
extra
points
overall
pretty
good
im
def
impressed
with
the
special
belgian
funky
beers
ive
tried
from
green
flash
so
far
nice
combination
of
great
hops
light
golden
malts
and
belgian
funky
yeast
combinations
that
blend
really
well
and
dont
overpower
in
any
category
still
very
drinkable
despite
the
big
heavy
yeast
hops
that
want
to
get
heavy
and
never
do
and
the
7
abv
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
rayon
vert
is
green
flash
notes
another
stellar
offering
from
green
flash
a
surprise
maybe
given
the
style
and
intensity
but
not
so
much
thinking
of
their
average
quality
a
nicely
hopped
take
on
a
brett
belgian
ale
which
sure
enough
draws
a
mental
connection
with
orval
this
one
might
become
a
regular
in
the
fridge
selection
this
is
pretty
kickass
glad
to
have
landed
a
fourpack
didnt
mean
to
crack
this
one
open
at
430
in
the
afternoon
but
i
dropped
it
against
another
bottle
and
it
hissed
at
me
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
a
style
i
must
pay
more
attentionrespect
to
recommended
beer
is
light
and
airy
on
the
palate
heavily
carbonated
strong
beer
overall
i
like
the
finish
not
too
dry
yeast
dominates
the
palate
overall
a
very
strong
funky
beer
decent
id
have
it
again
much
better
than
treasure
chest
o
a
delightful
surprise
very
well
rounded
delicious
well
done
green
flash
brewers
highly
recommended
if
you
like
brett
give
it
a
try
notes
dam
this
one
has
a
very
dry
finish
and
tasty
as
well
cheers
o
a
really
nice
offering
from
green
flash
id
be
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
o
the
plastic
flavor
and
inability
to
live
up
to
its
nose
disappoints
me
the
aroma
really
pulled
me
in
but
the
taste
let
me
down
ill
try
this
again
in
the
near
future
to
doublecheck
my
palate
overall
this
is
pretty
darn
impressive
drink
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
needed
a
bit
more
restaint
and
layered
balance
o
a
really
nice
interpretation
of
a
belgian
pale
i
highly
recommend
this
especially
to
people
interested
in
funky
beers
but
not
ready
for
or
desiring
a
punch
you
in
the
mouth
sour
beer
it
is
obviously
a
high
quality
beverage
it
is
stunningly
beautiful
in
the
glass
it
is
very
fragrant
but
the
smell
is
the
same
as
the
taste
and
i
dont
really
like
it
it
was
very
expensive
too
i
do
not
intend
to
buy
this
again
i
like
this
one
it
is
light
and
drinkable
with
good
peppery
flavors
this
is
for
sure
a
poor
mans
orval
104pack
or
5
a
bottle
one
of
these
days
ill
do
a
side
by
side
so
i
can
find
the
difference
until
then
i
give
the
nod
to
green
flash
for
copying
goose
island
and
coming
out
with
a
year
round
brett
finished
golden
belgian
ale
really
liked
this
beer
will
buy
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
belgianish
12
pz
bottle
pours
a
deep
amber
with
massive
fluffy
head
aroma
is
earthy
with
lemon
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
peppery
and
lemony
citrus
hops
and
coriander
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
with
dry
finish
im
typically
not
into
belgian
styles
but
im
coming
around
and
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
a
well
done
belgian
pale
ale
the
brett
makes
itself
obvious
but
still
allows
some
other
flavor
notes
to
come
through
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
and
sticky
on
the
palate
this
had
a
nice
combo
of
funky
and
tart
with
some
other
balancing
flavors
definitely
something
id
drink
again
one
cant
help
but
compare
this
to
orval
type
beers
this
is
far
far
better
than
the
latest
incarnations
of
matilda
the
last
really
good
batch
i
had
was
2005
and
even
gives
orval
a
run
for
its
money
though
i
wouldnt
put
this
on
that
level
quite
yet
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
these
age
but
i
wonder
that
the
brettanomyces
character
is
already
so
pronounced
this
cant
be
that
old
yet
and
the
brett
is
extremely
noticeable
already
young
orval
is
barely
kissed
by
the
brett
so
i
will
be
curious
to
see
how
these
age
my
one
worry
is
that
the
plastic
character
from
the
brett
will
get
a
bit
out
of
control
as
the
beer
ages
visually
this
beer
is
about
perfect
from
memory
it
seems
a
touch
darker
than
orval
but
i
could
be
wrong
and
the
extensive
long
lasting
head
is
quite
impressive
this
beer
sets
itself
apart
from
orval
in
its
use
of
expressive
fruity
and
citrus
laden
american
hops
as
a
sucker
for
many
an
american
hop
i
cant
help
but
love
this
beer
more
for
that
on
the
bottle
it
says
continuously
evolving
so
i
might
try
to
get
some
for
aging
this
is
a
decent
belgian
inspired
pale
ale
but
i
have
had
better
beers
by
green
flash
overall
this
one
is
a
winner
a
hoppedup
belgian
pale
with
a
nice
combination
of
tangy
flavors
and
high
drinkability
overall
impression
from
the
beginning
of
the
pour
this
was
a
strange
brew
im
not
sure
what
a
belgian
pale
ale
should
be
but
this
guy
was
abnormal
the
musky
finish
noncharacterstical
hop
flavor
and
unusual
carbonation
levels
did
not
make
any
positive
influence
on
my
review
of
this
one
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
again
thanks
for
the
try
alex
and
if
you
havent
had
this
one
yet
your
not
missing
out
green
flash
rayon
vert
glides
into
the
glass
easy
like
with
a
bright
orange
glaze
with
some
golden
specs
and
a
lively
frothy
creamy
bright
white
head
that
stays
and
sticks
smell
is
very
pungent
and
fresh
with
ripe
fruit
belgian
yeast
floral
notes
some
flower
and
fresh
earthy
scent
wow
this
smells
inviting
the
brett
jumps
out
with
some
sniffs
taste
is
just
as
fresh
as
the
scent
this
is
leaps
and
bounds
the
best
americanized
belgian
pale
ale
ive
had
in
some
time
fresh
fruity
esters
bubblegum
fresh
grass
notes
lemon
orange
bready
notes
and
more
yum
a
great
melange
that
works
feel
is
at
about
medium
with
ample
and
sparkling
carb
flavor
grabs
ahold
of
the
mouth
and
kicks
it
into
gear
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
which
is
a
tad
high
this
beer
works
it
kicks
ass
in
feel
and
has
alot
of
flavor
im
getting
more
overall
i
like
it
but
am
not
wowed
by
it
im
really
curious
to
age
this
and
see
how
it
develops
over
time
so
i
will
probably
buy
more
for
that
purpose
otherwise
i
think
there
are
better
brett
beers
out
there
though
maybe
not
this
inexpensive
note
this
is
a
beer
that
really
wants
to
be
served
at
the
correct
temperature
4550ºf
and
personally
i
think
the
flavors
come
out
better
the
warmer
it
is
so
aim
for
50
itll
make
a
very
big
difference
very
refreshing
balanced
and
tasty
o
overall
i
find
this
to
be
an
excellent
beerperhaps
straying
into
a
style
other
than
intended
by
the
brewer
but
quite
good
nonetheless
could
perhaps
use
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
anybody
ever
think
that
could
be
said
about
a
green
flash
offering
to
bring
it
more
in
line
with
the
style
but
on
the
other
hand
it
might

nice
to
see
4pack
bottles
of
this
everywhere
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
youd
look
for
in
a
special
release
d
this
was
a
decent
belgian
ale
the
scent
and
taste
were
fitting
for
the
style
but
didnt
do
anything
to
stand
out
the
body
was
a
little
weak
but
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
drink
but
entirely
forgettable
o
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
slightly
less
interesting
than
i
would
have
imagined
for
a
special
release
very
bland
and
flavorless
hopefully
bells
doesnt
sue
me
in
any
case
this
is
a
very
drinkable
belgian

slightly

color
with

lots
of
light
fruit
notes
with
a
little
spice
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
a
little
sweetness
a
beautiful
pale
straw
beer
with
a
bright
white
head
as
someone
who
doesnt
really
enjoy
belgians
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
the
malt
was
able
to
shine
through
the
pungent
belgian
yeast
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
you
wanted
something
a
little
different
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
about
this
beer
really
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
other
than
the
coriander
notes
some
other
reviewers
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
midwestern
influence
reminded
me
more
of
a
euro
lager
than
a
belgium
pale
overall
this
is
a
rather
enjoyable
belgian
pale
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
displays
the
belgian
fruit
characteristics
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
go
along
with
the
musty
malts
the
taste
is
quite
bitter
for
the
style
perhaps
the
bottle
very
fresh
the
beer
tasted
green
to
me
not
particularly
bad
but
the
grains
and
choice
of
hops
arent
agreeing
with
my
taste
buds
light
fruit
pungency
and
spices
get
lost
in
a
wave
of
earthy
hops
it
tastes
as
though
the
ingredients
cancel
out
and
leave
me
with
nothing
but
a
slight
bitterness
not
particularly
drinkable
but
a
decent
american
take
on
the
style
more
impressive
were
all
of
the
other
planets
thus
far
i
wouldnt
by
any
means
call
this
a
terrible
brew
just
average
which
i
usually
dont
associate
with
bells

with
a

exceptions
this

is
added
to

exception
list
it
was
pretty

somehow
it
reminded

of
fresh

a

i

you
might
say

drink

for

it
has

b
its
nice
but
its
a
little
bland
overall
its
a
one
time
deal
get
over
it
they
are
trying
something
different
and
there
is
this
new
thing
where
everyone
is
shitting
on
bells
but
honestly
this
beer
is
not
that
bad
not
up
to
bells
standard
not
as
bad
as
a
heineken
but
it
does
remind
me
a
bit
just
not
with
the
skunk
as
it
warmed
toward
the
end
the
bitterness
came
out
more
and
was
not
a
pleasing
aftertaste
has
an
lingering
alum
taste
more
like
a
euro
lager
in
taste
than
a
belgian
style
anything
is
this
what
bells
intended
or
did
something
go
wrong
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
planets
it
looks
fine
but
its
a
little
dark
from
yeast
otherwise
golden
only
fine
wisps
of
head
remain
after
a
pour
nose
is
tempting
with
peach
and
wheat
and
a
powdery
bit
of
yeast
taste
is
weakly
metallic
int
eh
finish
you
can
taste
the
a
small
metallic
bite
as
you
swallow
not
a
lot
of
fruitiness
on
the
palate
but
a
dry
malty
sweetness
some
pear
develops
earthy
and
sour
in
a
way
mouth
feel
is
a
little
flat
almost
phenolic
finished
slightly
bitter
and
with
a
strange
bit
ofmalty
sweetness
packaged

so
was
probably
best
consumed
fresh
rather
than
nearly
2
months
later
pours
a
very
light
head
that
dissapates
quickly
odd
for
this
style
nose
was
a
lighter
bready
yeast
that
reminded
me
more
of
a
euro
lager
than
a
belgium
pale
taste
was
a
huge
let
down
as
it
had
a
skunkiness
and
profile
more
similar
to
a
heineken
the
biscuity
malt
and
forward
floral
dry
hops
i
enjoy
in
a
belgium
pa
were
missing
almost
completely
a
real
dud
from
a
well
respected
brewery
bells
doesnt
miss
often
but
this
is
a
big
cut
at
a
curveball
in
the
dirt
not
undrinkable
but
not
enjoyable
im
really
happy
i
only
seized
on
a
single
submediocre
o
spicy
earthy
and
musty
loaded
with
plenty
of
flavor
for
4
8
deep
golden
hue
with
plenty
of
sediment
suspended
within
the
body
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
covers
the
rim
and
the
majority
of
the
top
i
detect
corianderorange
peeland
light
malt
the
taste
is
initially
corianderbut
then
the
light
belgian
malt
takes
over
and
there
is
a
light
sweetness
that
appears
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
dry
very
similar
to
new
belgium
sunshine
v
ery
wheaty
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
from
bells
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
and
a
tall
fluffy
bubbly
white
head
that
settles
out
fairly
quick
aromas
of
toasted
grains
subtle
banana
sweetness
nutmeg
and
clove
spices
bready
notes
and
a
subtle
butterscotch
sweetness
flavors
are
fairly
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
rich
and
sweet
caramel
and
butterscotch
blend
forward
laced
with
light
clove
and
nutmeg
spices
toasted
notes
hints
of
belgian
yeast
esters
and
funk
and
some
sweet
banana
characteristics
the
body
is
midrange
but
the
carbonation
keeps
it
crisp
and
slightly
dry
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
roast
and
banana
characteristics
smooth
dry
somewhat
crisp
finish
not
bad
o
it
is
a
light
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
ale
i
like
it
i
could
definitely
see
myself
downing
this
any
time
the
mood
strikes
for
a
belgian
pale
my
least
favorite
of
the
series
overall
not
bad
but
just
not
overly
good
could
be
more
refreshing
and
the
mustiness
takes
away
a
bit
on
it
gold
colored
beer
with
suspended
floating
bits
throughout
head
is
large
and
fluffy
for
a
short
while
before
it
turns
to
a
thin
patchy
sheet
and
a
ring
aroma
is
spicy
with
floral
and
fruity
esters
lightly
phenolic
banana
cream
pie
flowery
a
little
farmy
pizza
doughy
with
slight
lemonwheaty
tartness
taste
is
all
of
the
above
and
pleasantly
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
down
and
not
overly
yeasty
either
bells
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
not
very
good
should
have
listened
to
the
reviews
nice
try
bells
still
love
you
guys
for
black
note
so
its
all
good
not
my
type
of
brew
didnt
like
the
sour
smell
or
taste
eric
o
limited
complexity
but
no
bothersome
flaws
more
enjoyable
than
bells
venus
overall
not
a
very
impressive
beer
it
drinks
like
an
undercarbonated
pilsner
o
i
wasnt
crazy
over
this
one
i
expect
more
from
bells
im
not
sure
if
ill
continue
with
the
series
i
thought
mars
was
amazing
venus
was
a
flop
this
was
a
step
up
from
venus
but
nothing
special
by
any
means
12

packaged

pours
a

gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
head
retention
and

are
both
decent
enough
the
brew
smells
like
pears
cloves
and
some
wheatbready
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
apricot
and
white
grapes
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
an
ok
beer
but
theres
nothing
about
this
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
i
expect
better
from
bells
but
this
was
just
pretty
meh
glad
i
just
got
a
single
of
this
judging
by
many
of
the
other
reviews
its
possible
that
production
was
inconsistent
either
that
or
its
possible
that
wholefoods
somehow
stored
or
transported
it
improperly
strange
off
yeast
flavors
but
perhaps
just
not
to
my
preference
o
this
is
the
first
of
the
series
i
have
tried
this
was
ok
nothing
spectacular
not
sure
if
the
single
price

was
justified

second
offering
ive
tried
from
the

planet
series
first
was

which
generally

pretty
let
down
on
this
one
was
expecting
much
more
out
if
this
smell
is
lacking
substance
and
the
flavor
is
just
weak
for
the
price
and
the
hype
i
had
going
into
this
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
it
just
smells

it
was

its
just

aroma
outlier
review
bad
bad
bad
there
should
be
no
outlier
detected
this
beer
is
just
awful
the
aroma
seems
a
bit
off
but
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
true
to
form
for
this
style
drink
this
one
too
cold
and
youre
in
for
a
disappointing
time
opening
it
straight
out
of
the
fridge
led
me
to
believe
it
might
have
gotten
skunked
let
it
warm
up
though
and
it
becomes
considerably
less
objectionable
tastes
like
a
fairly
average
bpa
not
terribly
exciting
but
if
they
still
have
a
few
at
my
local
beer
place
next
week
i
might
pick
another
one
up
o
the
aroma
is
off
but
the
taste
is
decent
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
certainly
there
are
worse
beersd
out

very
disappointing
bells
brews
some
of
the
best
beers
around
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
yikes
things
have
fallen
off
fast
since
mars
at
least
venus
took
a
swing
and
missed
but
this
one
simply
brings
very
little
to
the
tablejust
not
worth
seeking
out
recommendation
if
youre
keeping
up
with
the
series
thus
far
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
so
check

if
not
its
definitely
passable
unless
youre
a
huge
fan
of
bells
tasty
belgian
i
liked
it
not
very
enjoyable
lacking
a
defining
taste
o
slightly
disappointed
in
this
offering
from
bells
i
have
higher
expectations
than
was
delivered
here
there
is
something
slightly
off
in
both
the
flavors
and
aromas
skunky
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
not
sure
i
would
go
for
another
of
these
mostly
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
bone
white
head
big
aromas
of
rhino
farts
bready
yeasty
malt
and
touches
of
lemon
rich
bready
malt
flavor
with
all
the
yeast
derived
flavors
i
expected
decent
brew
i
love
bells
beer
and
its
one
of
my
favorite
brewpubs
to
visit
but
this
well
mars
was
much
much
better
than
mercury
and
venus
so
maybe
theres
hope
for
the
larger
planets
tmo
fairly
meh
malty
grainy
pilsner
like
with
hints
of
belgian
sweetness
more
pale
ale
than
belgian
but
fairly
forgettable
medium
body
fizzy
carbonation
not
bad
just
nothing
special
maybe
some
soft
melon
notes
on
the
nose
and
taste
but
other
than
that
run
of
the
mill
makes
sense
that
these
one
offs
arent
anything
crazy
if
they
were
they
wouldntshouldnt
be
one
offs
a
cool
tick
nonetheless
ill
be
sure
to
spread
the
other
bottles
around
so
others
can
enjoy
the
taste
light
bodied
little
sweetness
on
the
finish
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
some
distinctive
stuff
going
on
at
least
from
my
previous
experiences
poured
a
strawcolor
from
the
12oz
into
my
snifter
definitely
unfiltered
definitely
very
little
in
the
way
of
head
a
hint
of
pear
and
a
ton
of
white
grapewhite
wine
aromas
on
the
nose
just
a
hint
of
the
yeast
clean
and
subtle
bit
sour
on
the
front
of
the
sip
with
some
surprisingly
bright
notes
emerging
refreshing
just
a
hint
of
warmth
on
the
back
end
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
and
the
bit
of
lingering
aftertaste
was
very
styleappropriate
very
different
take
on
the
belgian
to
me
i
am
used
to
mostly
trippels
and
quads
and
very
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
i
dont
know
exactly
whats
off
about
this
one
many
things
though
it
is
weird
and
not
for
me
another
letdown
from
the
planet
series
very
off
smell
not
much
going
on
with
the
taste
a
boring
beer
for
a
boring
style
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
with
one
count
em
one
splotchy
ring
of
lace
sticking
as
we
proceed
down
the
glass
smell
floral
wheat
cracker
coriander
not
much
happening
here
taste
same
and
soapy
to
boot
with
a
little
husk
and
even
less
orange
peel
i
imagine
that
filtering
a
mediocre
wit
would
put
you
in
mercurys
neighborhood
venus
was
an
adjunctoverpowered
mess
but
mercury
is
just
plain
underwhelming
and
boring
not
bad
but
for
for
a
one
time
brew
it
was
a
tad
disappointing
a
nice
enough
belgian
pale
ale
some
light
breadiness
i
prefer
a
bit
more
punch
here
along
with
some
mild
spicy
notes
as
well
as
fruity
notes
of
apples
and
pears
the
fruity
notes
provide
a
slightly
tart
finish
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
with
the
spicy
aroma
being
its
strong
point
o
a
tasty
low
abv
belgian
ale
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
awesome
in
the
summer
time
light
golden
body
with
a
mild
haze
and
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
aromas
of
clove
belgian
yeast
banana
fruity
esters
alcohol
wheat
lemon
flavor
is
not
on
par
with
any
of
the
respectable
belgian
ales
of
a
similar
ilk
a
bit
brash
and
harsh
lacking
subtlety
nuance
fruity
yeast
with
a
lemony
hop
finish
i
was
hoping
for
more
considering
the
brewery
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
a
special
release
o
a
decent
beer
overall
though
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
overall
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
and
worth
trying
i
only
wished
this
came
out
during
the
summer
so
i
could
enjoy
it
more
these
bells
planet
series
beers
have
been
great
this
one
especially
a
drinkable
lowabv
maltforward
belgian
with
tons
of
midwestern
influence
and
flavor
to
the
max
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
big
bells
fan
and
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
thankful
for
getting
to
try
this
better
then
the
venus
one
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
rustic
with
bread
mild
honey
moderate
spice
pepper
and
mild
phenols
and
a
great
hop
character
earthy
and
mildly
lemony
i
do
get
a
mild
orange
peel
and
grains
of
paradise
character
as
well
the
palate
opens
with
a
dry
crisp
snappy
cracker
malt
character
and
a
wonderfully
complementary
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
a
blend
of
earth
lemons
and
green
grass
the
mid
palate
has
some
of
the
yeast
expression
spicy
and
mildly
phenolic
drying
and
crisp
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
light
in
body
highly
carbonated
and
has
lingering
flavors
of
crackers
earth
lemon
and
a
little
floral
character
excellent
this
is
a
delicate
and
easydrinking
but
fairly
complex
and
excellently
balanced
beer
it
may
not
have
been
my
best
choice
on
this
subzero
minnesota
day
but
that
is
hardly
the
beers
fault
overall
a
very
solid
session
belgian
pale
ale
nice
mix
of
yeast
fruit
and
spice
flavors
that
would
make
you
think
its
a
heavier

this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
straight
belgian
ales
but
this
really
reminded
me
of
north
coast
pranqster
specifically
how
clean
and
crisp
the
beer
tasted
it
also
did
not
have
the
traditional
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
i
expected
i
can
see
how
if
you
were
going
in
expecting
a
more
traditional
belgian
this
beer
would
be
a
disappointment
but
for
me
it
was
the
opposite
light
golden
clean
easy
drinking
good
flavor
wasnt
the
heavy
craft
beer
that
i
expected
from
bells
this
is
something
i
could
easily
drink
all
summer
even
though
it
came
out
in
december
i
want
to
keep
trying
this
planet
series
i
want
to
keep
liking
bells
but
goddamn
it
make
something
good
mars
great
lets
not
speak
of
venus
and
now
mercury
its
like
a
budweiserbelgosession
at
least
i
can
finish
this
one
light
very
light
probably
wouldnt
be
so
critical
if
i
didnt
expect
more
from
bells
too
much
cereal
and
grain
in
the
nose
nice
estery
profile
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
without
being
too
thin
my
favorite
of
the
series
thus
far
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
like
the
fruity
esters
a
little
too
earthy
and
bitter
for
my
palate
o
this
is
the
second
sub
par
effort
from
the
bells
planet
series
its
a
decent
session
beer
but
nothing
more
than
that
hazy
golden
yellow
with
some
suspended
yeast
particles
and
topped
with
a
nice
milky
white
head
smells
of
moderate
belgian
yeast
spiciness
grass
pears
and
a
honeylike
malty
sweetness
simple
but
pleasant
flavor
is
a
little
spicier
but
mostly
follows
the
aroma
with
bready
grain
straw
peppercorns
and
a
slight
citrus
acidity
i
like
it
light
crisp
and
very
drinkable
not
sure
what
other
people
were
expecting
but
this
is
a
wellmade
sessionable
belgianstyle
beer
truly
subpar
brew
nose
is
promising
citrus
pear
taste
does
not
follow
at
all
very
watery
nothingy
up
front
some
kind
of
cereal
mild
belgian
taste
on
the
back
on
par
with
something
youd
find
in
a
dundee
craft
pack
nowhere
close
to
normal
level
of
bells
excellence
o
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
but
really
nothing
terribly
special
solid
all
the
way
though
o
i
really
dug
this
beer
its
not
amazing
or
that
complex
but
it
is
very
refreshing
and
an
interesting
offering
from
a
big
craft
brewer
i
liked
this
one
much
more
than
venus
what
is
bells
doing
besides
putting
out
below
average
beer
in
this
planet
series
this
beer
has
no
smell
or
taste
worth
note
the
only
thing
i
taste
is
some
belgian
yeast
and
malt
nothing
worthwhile
i
think
i
am
done
with
this
series
with
that
said
i
drank
6
of
them
and
thought
it
was
a
very
good
effort
crisp
lively
even
refreshing
o
pretty
decent
belgian
style
but
nothing
like
duvel
it
was
nice
to
drink
and
fans
of
this
style
might
enjoy
it
i
think
bells
did
a
great
job
on
this
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
amazing
for
the
low
abv
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
all
summer
if
it
was
available

a

the

is
pretty

overall
a

o
im
embarrassed
to
say
how
much
i
paid
for
this
overall
bells
need
to
reevaluate
this
recipe
imo
the
unfiltered
part
of
the
beer
makes
this
beer
pretty
great
tastefeel
medium
feel
with
a
moderatelow
carbonation
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
faintness
allaround
with
clove
being
at
the
forefront
with
a
little
bit
of
banana
and
then
a
little
bit
of
cornlike
adjunct
flavor
finishes
clean
but
overall
bleh
it
tastes
rather
light
as
id
expect
given
the
abv
and
isnt
at
all
blowing
me
away
like
i
thought
these
planet
series
beers
would
mars
did
but
both
this
and
venus
have
been
let
downs
anyway
the
taste
is
light
with
no
real
intensity
its
just
loaded
with
subtly
thats
not
normally
a
bad
thing
but
this
is
just
a
meh
beer
thats
the
very
definitely
of
decent
not
only
did
i
expect
something
fantastic
from
bells
i
anticipated
something
pretty
much
earth
shattering
since
its
the
planet
series
i
could
deal
with
venus
being
one
of
those
adventurous
beers
that
couldnt
quite
make
it
but
this
is
just
a
hohum
belgian
pale
ale
that
i
paid
3
for
just
because
of
the
label
oh
well
like
venus
i
know
not
to
buy
it
again
this
series
is
turning
out
to
be
a
disappointment
so
far
i
think
this
beer
and
probably
venus
as
well
would
score
lower
had
they
not
been
bells
planet
series
beers
this
beer
shouldve
just
been
called
bells

crisp
clean
and
leaving
the
palate
highly
refreshed

aroma
offers
some
strong
cereal
grain
sweetness
herbal
tones
from
some
hops
and
spice
from
the
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
the
aroma
but
the
grains
tend
to
dominate
a
little
more
in
flavor
expected
though
given
its
low
abv
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
good
deal
and
easily
my
favorite
of
the
planet
series
releases
so
far
would
be
a
really
nice
session
ale
if
priced
more
affordably
offer
this
in
six
packs
at
10
or
less
and
id
be
a
happy
customer
current
price
point
will
keep
me
away
from
buying
this
one
again
though
and
i
did
dock
points
from
it

overall

to
affordability

i
was
extremely
pleased
with
this

perhaps
its
just
due
to
me
finding
a
new
style
i
like
which
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
in
but
i
really
loved
the
taste
of
this
beer
as
most
have
noted
this
was
decent
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
that
blew
my
socks
off
overall
a
rather
average
interpretation
of
this
style
cant
really
recommend
it
when
there
are
so
many
superior
and
authentic
belgian
examples
within
easy
reach
its
not
disgusting
but
totally
ordinary
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
czech
pilsner
rather
than
a
bpa
totally
a
disappointment
at
least
venus
was
trying
to
be
unique
the
mass
produced
leffe
blonde
is
much
better
than
this
i
love
bells
but
this
beer
is
a
joke
compared
to
what
they
can
do
i
think
bells
is
exploiting
the
marketability
of
the
planet
series
with
this
one
what
a
shame
its
a
good
belgium
pale
ale
400th
rated
beer
o
this
one
isnt
so
impressive
pretty
fruity
and
there
isnt
a
lot
of
that
great
belgian
yeast
spicy
trait
if
i
were
to
rate
this
outside
of
style
i
might
rate
it
almost
a
half
a
point
higher
not
a
lot
of
people
apparently
like
this
one
given
the
reviews
but
im
not
sure
why
its
a
seasonal
that
tends
to
be
available
for
a
good
part
of
the
year
and
i
can
usually
find
it
if
im
looking
for
it
this
is
a
belgianstyle
pale
which
i
guess
confuses
some
people
and
its
not
a
common
style
so
maybe
thats
the
issue
but
whatever
its
a
good
mild
pale
perfect
for
warm
spring
or
fall
days
give
this
one
a
try
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
with
a
thin
white

that
dissipates
to
patches
leaving
wispy

mixed

and

slightly
vegetal
flavor
is
light
caramel
malt
thin
light

juice
light

and
belgian
yeast
light
bodied
a
rather
mild
and
malty
take
on
a
belgian
pale
with
understated
belgian
yeast
and
light
flavors
a
kind
of
hybrid
between
a
belgian
ale
and
light
lager
pleasant
enough
but
underwhelming
not
getting
the
relationship
between
belgium
and
karma
so
maybe
im
missing
some
nuance
in
this
ale
medium
to
medium
light
body
and
carbonation
a
more
interesting
pale
ale
but
still
on
the
mild
side
overall
perhaps
i
have
an
oddly
good
example
of
this
beer
based
on
the
relatively
low
ratings
ba

it
drinks
very
nicely
and
has
a
nice
wellbalanced
malt
character
throughout
mild
fruity
esters
really
compliment
the
malt
profile
an
enjoyable
late
summer
thirst
quencher
havent
had
a
bad
avery
brew
yet
o
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
than
a
belgian
due
to
the
very
mild
fruit
element
although
the
malt
flavor
is
also
rather
low
except
for
the
dark
color
it
might
even
pass
for
a
lager
refreshing
white
head
copper
body
minimal
faint
hops
in
the
aroma
strong
notes
of
caramel
sweet
on
the
pallet
with
caramel
and
un
baked
bread
notes
very
drinkable
and
smooth
karma
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
lively
stream
of
bubbles
rising
to
meet
a
rather
thin
tanwhite
head
bready
aroma
flat
hops
sort
of
tinny
some
tart
fruits
apples
or
cherries
first
tastes
are
sort
of
bland
pale
malts
followed
by
more
crisp
fruit
like
tastes
herbally
hops
o
i
can
see
why
this
doesnt
get
the
best
ratings
but
its
definitely
underrated
it
is
quite
flavorful
and
definitely
worth
a
try
avery
brewing
karma

pours
gold
with
minimal
lacing
initial
blush
of
belgian
candy
sugar
folds
into
a
lightly
malted
pale
ale
this
isnt
something
id
seek
out
but
considering
its
5
2
its
not
a
bad
session
beer
maybe
this
is
more
to
the
liking
of
others
but
im
one
and
done
with
this
brew
big
fan
of
the
brewery
though
overall
a
disappointing
first
experience
from
a
brewery
that
ive
heard
good
things
about
i
wont
be
giving
up
on
avery
just
because
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
this
beer
this
isnt
going
to
be
real
inciteful
not
much
i
have
to
say
about
this
beer
it
was
the
only
one
on
tap
that
i
hadnt
had
soooo
typical
belgian
yeast
and
crispness
in
the
taste
a
little
bit
of
amber
ale
flavor
tastes
like
a
belgian
version
of
new
belgiums
fat
tire
there
you
go
i
tend
to
enjoy
every
thing
by
avery
but
this
missed
my
personal
mark
overall
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
overall
meh
clean
and
fresh
well
made
not
much
flavor
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
absolutely
no
head
no
lacing
smells
of
plum
and
a
touch
of
yeast
tastes
of
red
plum
and
thats
about
it
thin
mouth
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
tastes
like
plumflavored
water
disappointing
offering
from
a
good
brewery
the
karma
from
avery
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
the
beer
comes
across
more
like
an
apple
wine
or
something
the
color
is
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
is
belgium
twangy
fermented
fruit
the
taste
has
the
belgian
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
ok
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
better
beers
in
the
style
o
not
real
impressive
certainly
not
horrible
but
as
mediocre
as
you
will
find
i
had
hi
hopes
for
this
one
but
not
much
is
going
on
pours
a
tangerinehoney
color
no
real
head
the
smell
is
a
real
tease
bready
honeydew
coriander
some
citrus
some
funk
for
a
belgianstyle
ale
this
ones
one
of
the
flattest
tasting
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
theres
a
sour
fruit
flavor
thats
on
top
some
sweetness
a
bit
of
yeast
but
the
carbonation
simply
buries
any
decent
ingredients
and
flavors
overall
man
i
dont
know
i
suppose
there
was
a
good
beer
in
this
bottle
at
one
time
but
not
today
i
sure
wish
i
had
some
way
of
knowing
which
bottle
i
should
grab
in
the
store
its
not
awful
but
definitely
a
disappointment
maybe
i
picked
up
some
bad
karma
zing
id
probably
give
it
another
chance
but
not
unless
i
was
sure
it
was
fresh
overall
a
poor
example
of
the
style
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
as
it
goes
down
easy
overall
its
an
interesting
american
take
on
the
belgian
style
pale
one
that
i
think
most
should
try
only
because
it
is
so
different
its
actually
pretty
good
but
does
have
its
flaws
wouldnt
mind
having
this
on
tap
paired
with
some
fish
or
chicken
all
in
all
a
great
beer
and
great
to
give
as
gifts
and
have
for
a
party
and
cellar
and
you
know
do
what
ever
it
is
you
doo
with
beer
named
karma
so
you
dont
piss
her
off
o
okay
but
doesnt
excell
at
much
oi
like
avery
and
i
like
bpas
unfortunately
this
beer
did
not
satisfy
either
category
from
the
lackluster
flat
looks
to
the
lackluster
flat
feel
and
everything
in
between
this
beer
just
did
not
do
anything
for
me
and
i
found
nothing
belgian
about
it
pours
a
clear
reddishorange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
fairly
faint
with
malt
grain
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
has
subdued
aromas
and
flavors
o
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
kind
of
jumps
out
but
a
better
than
average
taste
and
such
overall
ive
had
farmhouse
ales
before
and
have
liked
them
but
lately
ive
run
into
a
few
that
i
just
cant
get
behindthe
flavor
here
is
a
little
too
yeast
funky
for
me
drowning
out
the
malts
that
characterize
the
pale
aleits
light
its
drinkable
and
its
not
bad
but
its
also
not
a
standout
brew
and
one
i
could
leave
alone
in
the
futureive
had
a
few
avery
brews
before
and
have
liked
them
so
if
this
is
your
style
id
say
give
it
a
whirlbut
for
me
one
is
enough35
overall
a
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
it
makes
a
rather
good
session
but
overall
is
nothing
too
special
a
bland
example
of
the
style
i
will
pass
this
up
anytime
o
i
remember
finding
this
beer
tasty
and
refreshing
when
i
first
tasted
it
in
the
summer
on
draft
now
that
its
december
it
seems
rather
thin
but
when
the
days
are
long
and
warm
its
a
good
way
to
enjoy
a
nice
maltsugarhop
balanced
profile
without
getting
weighed
down
this
will
be
something
i
look
for
heading
into
oktoberfest
season
when
i
went
to
post
i
discovered
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
belgium
pale
ale
with
that
as
the
target
i
would
like
to
see
more
nuance
in
the
maltsugar
profile
and
a
bit
more
finish
to
remind
me
of
the
tastes
that
just
passed
over
my
tongue
edited
while
i
cant
say
the
beer
tastes
bad
i
can
say
its
not
up
to
style
reduced
taste
score
to
2
5
for
the
category
it
gets
a
sad
shake
of
the
head
as
a
drinkable
sudsy
brew
and
who
cares
what
they
drink
in
belgium
its
a
winner
i
suppose
you
could
say
its
a
lighter
version
of
great
divides
colette
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
pinkies
in
san
angelo
overall
ok
but
not
great
some
decent
belgian
yeast
additions
but
seems
strangely
boozy
hops
are
barely
there
and
not
great
and
malts
cant
decide
to
be
belgian
like
or
saison
or
wheat
its
ok
overall
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
o
like
it
also
more
than
i
expected
definitely
would
get
it
again

fair
amount

very

stuff
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
i
probably
would
not
have
this
again
ontap
via
a
kegerator
sixtel
it
appeared
a
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
its
not
terribly
belgian
by
taste
the
beer
is
a
very
smooth
almost
creamy
blonde
ale
with
fruity
undertones
leffe
for
example
has
a
crisp
edge
to
the
flavor
that
this
lacks
karmas
a
clear
crowdpleaser
but
dont
be
expecting
a
something
out
of
brussels
overall
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
it
is
a
much
more
conservative
effort
than
im
used
to
from
avery
but
for
some
that
may
be
a
good
thing
on
tap
at
lazy
dog
in
boulder
co
pours
orange
with
white
long

malt
apples
and

full
and
crisp
caramel
earthy
hops
candy
sugar
and
yeast
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
short
and
semidry
just
ok
brew
to
me
with
the
increasing
prowess
of
american
brewers
were
getting
more
and
more
examples
of
well
done
belgian
ales
that
aside
its
still
nice
to
be
able
to
get
one
that
isnt
a
complete
disaster
this
one
isnt
really
bringing
great
flavor
character
and
its
kind
of
soapy
but
its
still
an
easy
drinker
and
not
too
bad
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
comes
across
more
like
a
blonde
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
really
one
of
averys
weaker
offerings
in
my
opinion
forgettable
and
no
reason
to
revisit
anytime
soon
the
pour
is
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
spices
are
the
first
thing
i
notice
on
the
aroma
coriander
clove
and
nutmeg
are
there
a
bit
of
apple
and
pear
but
sort
of
watery
some
sweet
malt
and
sugar
in
the
background
mostly
spices
on
the
palate
but
noticeably
watery
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
some
hints
of
citrus
peel
and
thats
about
it
whats
there
is
enjoyable
but
its
too
watered
down
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
wasnt
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
an
average
beer
at
best
it
was
going
in
the
right
direction
till
it
got
to
the
taste
which
was
more
similar
to
an
apa
not
a
bpa
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
but
it
was
over
carbonated
and
the
taste
really
didnt
hold
my
interest
one
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
they
were
equally
good
and
were
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
the
carbonation
the
taste
wasnt
true
to
style
and
the
carbonation
was
a
little
out
of
hand
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
doesnt
deliver
as
advertised
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
this
was
my
first
beer
from
avery
that
i
didnt
care
for
this
brewery
is
pretty
solid
but
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
rare
miss
for
me
from
them
i
just
dont
think
this
beer
did
the
style
justice
i
am
still
down
to
try
more
of
their
beers
but
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
from
them
and
one
of
my
least
favorite
belgian
pale
ales
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
this
is
definately
not
a
bad
pale
ale
not
the
best
pale
ale
in
the
world
though
it
would
be
a
normal
drinker
if
i
enjoyed
this
type
more
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
malt
and
grain
on
the
nose
reinforced
on
the
palate
with
apple
cider
iodine
and
bandaid
watery
mouthfeel
with
solid
carbonation
not
much
here
except
flaws
to
my
mind
happily
other
brewers
are
doing
this
style
very
well
c
o
certainly
the
worst
ive
had
from
avery
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
thumbs
width
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
and
fair
lacing
a
yeasty
aroma
with
some
sweet
cantaloupe
and
pepper
flavor
follows
suit
very
light
and
bright
flavor
medium
bodied
not
too
much
activity
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
attains
some
interesting
flavors
but
a
little
watered
down
and
inconsistent
from
one
try
to
the
next
i
have
had
this
a
bunch
of
times
at
its
best
times
its
good
at
its
worst
times
is
just
average
this
would
be
a
pleasing
session
beer
to
drink
whilst
angling
or
watching
a
professional
sports
contest
m
light
and
spritzey
quite
sessionable
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
soft
texture
it
has
on
the
palate
o
not
bad
but
nothing
amazing
not
a
huge
fan
notes
consumed
on
572012
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
decently
tasty
but
nothing
ill
be
coming
back
to
avery
can
and
has
done
better
im
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
great
but
really
ended
up
lacking
in
most
aspects
as
far
as
belgian
pale
ales
go
its
not
bad
but
there
are
many
that
are
tastier
as
far
as
beers
by
avery
this
is
the
only
bland
beer
that
i
can
remember
having
from
them
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
id
be
willing
to
try
it
again
it
wasnt
terrible
it
just
didnt
have
much
taste
to
it
a
very
average
beer
by
avery
standards
totally
nondescript
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
especially
in
the
nose
after
a
pale
amber
pour
with
a
good
tall
white
head
it
smells
fairly
sweet
and
malt
based
somehow
entirely
missing
is
the
belgian
yeast
that
is
supposed
to
power
this
brew
this
is
a
majorly
dumbed
down
beer
feel
is
off
a
bit
very
weak
carbonation
makes
the
beer
feel
flat
and
heavy
instead
of
the
bright
crispy
feeling
usually
characteristic
of
belgian
pale
ales
overall
a
real
letdown
from
a
brewery
i
have
come
to
associate
with
exceptional
beer
o
i
have
loved
almost
every
beer
that
avery
has
put
out
but
this
one
truly
falls
flat
just
not
a
good
beer
at
all
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
malts
yeast
taste
is
mild
some
spices
fruits
a
bit
malty
smooth
but
not
strong
flavor
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
o
a
refreshing
and
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
belgian
pale
ale
but
this
meek
beer
lacks
substance
if
there
were
a
category
for
light
belgian
pales
this
beer
would
fit
there
so
a
decent
session
ale
and
a
good
transitional
beer
for
those
new
to
craft
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
not
much
of
a
scent
other
then
some
hints
of
grains
as
nothing
stands
out
texture
is
smooth
and
creamy
wheats
and
sweet
citrus
tickle
your
taste
buds
some
hints
of
coriander
and
banana
are
evident
as
well
a
good
refreshing
drink
that
is
what
i
consider
to
be
a
high
end
blue
moon
beer
a
great
summertime
drink
o
without
a
bottle
date
and
this
being
my
first
crack
at
karma
i
cant
tell
if
this
beer
is
fresh
or
not
if
it
is
fresh
its
not
apparent
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
all
a
quick
check
on
averys
website
indicates
that
this
beer
is
anywhere
from
3
to
7
months
old
so
no
not
very
fresh
at
all
o
the
beer
has
an
interesting
smell
and
taste
but
could
use
stronger
aromas
and
flavors
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
dark
golden
amer
color
with
a
2
finger
bubbly
dirty
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
head
clung
to
the
sides
nicely
and
left
a
thin
central
layer
on
top
aroma
was
floral
with
a
small
hint
of
spice
hiding
in
the
back
very
small
tad
of
sour
taste
was
yeasty
up
front
but
then
shifted
to
a
light
floralcitrus
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
perhaps
a
smidge
thin
and
a
smidge
overcarbonated
but
not
terrible
overall
a
reasonable
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
was
nothing
special
drinking
one
was
good
and
thats
probably
all
i
need
a
great
sessionable
bpa
with
unique
equatorial
hop
chaacter
gotta
get
a
fresh
one
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
in
the
long
run
its
uninteresting
the
taste
is
one
dimensional
though
enjoyable
the
enjoyment
is
short
lived
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
reviewed

o
it
is
an
alright
beer
that
i
wont
be
getting
excited
over
each
limited
release
a
decent
beer
lacking
on
both
the
aromas
and
flavor
but
very
drinkable
with
some
decent
hops
along
with
it
this
is
really
the
first
time
ive
been
a
bit
disappointed
by
avery
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
its
just
meh
and
the
bpa
is
a
pretty
tough
category
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
so
thats
good
i
couldnt
really
imagine
having
to
drink
six
of
these
overall
starts
off
great
but
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
so
distracting
that
the
entire
brew
becomes
a
disapointment
overall
i
personally
dont
think
i
am
going
to
buy
it
again
for
myself
but
my
girlfriend
and
the
brother
like
quite
a
bit
so
it
will
probably
make
its
way
back
into
my
beer
fridge
again
in
the
future
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
smallish
head
perfume
like
aromas
with
slight
berry
notes
tastes
pretty
clean
and
neutral
almost
seems
like
a
blond
ale
to
me
feels
light
with
low
bitterness
overall
was
expecting
more
from
this
brew
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
would
be
a
great
starter
beer
for
a
novice
craft
beer
drinker
o
this
beer
looks
nice
and
is
trying
hard
to
be
a
belgian
pale
ale
however
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
dont
quite
make
it
there
are
hints
of
the
genre
but
it
is
lacking
overall
overall
its
not
very
memorable
for
the
style
mediumbodied
a
funky
but
drinkable
beer
with
decent
carbonation
complexity
is
there
but
not
totally
balanced
refreshing
but
not
that
memorable
and
not
a
preferred
belgian
pale
ale
for
me
its
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
regularly
or
bring
a
pack
to
a
party
drink
it
if
you
like
curry
o
im
quite
dissapointed
avery
usually
delivers
wellcrafted
products
and
generally
belgian
pale
ale
is
a
sure
thing
here
its
just
ok
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
personally
like
more
taste
and
mouthfeel
from
it
but
it
is
good
in
its
own
right
at
the
moment
conclusion
much
better
than
i
anticipated
from
the
dismal
reviews
this
beer
has
received
i
think
this
is
tasty
and
well
crafted
surprisingly
subtle
from
a
brewery
that
has
a
reputation
for
overpowering
themselves
in
the
flavor
department
pours
a
clear
light
copper
body
with
a
thin
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
properties
aromas
are
powerfully
toasty
and
a
bit
marshmallowlike
reminiscent
of
smores
taste
is
intensely
toasty
from
start
to
finish
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
the
flavor
is
low
on
complexity
but
quite
intense
with
what
it
has
its
not
bad
but
it
fails
to
hold
my
interest
after
the
first
few
sips
in
the
end
it
leaves
a
wet
cardboard
taste
which
is
enough
to
make
me
never
want
another
72
the
taste
is
kind
of
like
date
nut
bread
or
some
sort
of
dark
fruit
bread
it
seems
like
the
yeast
here
was
trying
to
go
big
or
go
home
and
just
chose
to
go
home
the
profile
is
all
there
but
no
part
of
it
really
lives
up
to
its
full
potential
o
cant
say
id
buy
this
one
again
certainly
have
had
worse
beers
in
my
life
but
have
had
way
better
for
the
style
just
wish
that
the
flavors
lasted
a
little
forgettable
brew
this
qualifies
as
a
session
beer
but
thats
not
saying
much
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
and
this
is
not
as
tasty
or
enjoyable
as
more
popular
offerings
in
this
category
i
didnt
mind
that
the
aftertaste
lingered
so
long
but
i
just
never
warmed
up
to
it
karma
should
be
more
than
whats
beheld
and
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
this
is
the
avery
beer
that
ive
enjoyed
the
least
by
a
fair
margin
the
flavors
were
pretty
muted
it
tastes
like
a
sour
pale
ale
but
there
wasnt
any
depth
oh
well
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
pour
and
this
bliss
tasting
moves
on
this
offering
pours
a
clear
sunset
bronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
green
apple
biscuits
grapefruit
banana
black
pepper
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
pear
black
pepper
light
nutmeg
white
grapes
toffee
and
biscuits
the
belgian
character
is
rather
subdued
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
bpa
but
one
thats
definitely
lacking
on
the
b
id
drink
another
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
too
quickly
o
this
has
so
much
potential
but
fails
to
deliver
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
tastes
good
but
lacks
oomph
the
flavors
falls
off
a
cliff
and
is
very
unmemorable
this
pours
a
clear
light
copperish
color
with
a
decent
slightly
off
white
head
the
smell
is
light
and
perhaps
biscuity
i
dont
get
any
belgium
yeast
smells
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
also
light
i
get
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
some
caramel
biscuit
malt
i
dont
get
the
beligum
name
this
is
a
pretty
basic
pale
ale
expect
a
low
hop
pale
ale
and
not
much
belgium
its
not
bad
but
nothing
im
wowed

there
is
a
light
caramel
hint
to
an
aftertaste
that
borders
on
dry
on
this
medium
bodied
fare
with
a
vigorous
pour
karma
produces
little
head
which
has
no
staying
power
it
is
also
a
bit
dark
for
a
belgian
pale
which
i
usually
assume
will
be
bright
and
pretty
clear
the
aroma
is
lacking
as
well
there
is
some
of
the
signature
belgian
yeast
spicy
clove
and
an
odd
heavy
citrus
aroma
maybe
some
orange
the
flavor
is
better
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
along
with
a
bit
more
mild
belgian
yeast
character
than
in
the
nose
it
is
pretty
light
and
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
good
light
and
well
carbed
karma
is
a
good
solid
beer
but
really
nothing
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
a
fairly
decent
beer
quite
drinkable
but
doesnt
leave
that
big
of
an
impression
pour
is
a
nice
red
amber
hue
with
a
small
white
head
sweet
malts
light
yeast
and
some
hop
fill
the
nose
taste
is
nice
caramel
malt
with
some
light
hoppiness
palate
is
a
nice
medium
body
carbonation
is
good
finish
is
sweet
maltiness
some
sweet
spices
with
some
yeast
and
slight
fruitiness
ending
with
a
nutty
bitter
ending
overall
a
good
drinkable
brew
this
brew
poured
up
a
clear
dark
copper
colored
body
with
a
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
with
good
retention
and
amazing
lazing
aromas
of
peppery
spices
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
and
bread
dough
flavors
of
caramel
toasted
malts
and
a
light
hint
of
citrusy
hops
mediumbodied
with
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
with
a
nice
caramel
flavor
lingering
about
overall
this
is
tasty
but
a
little
too
mild
you
could
easly
slam
a
6er
of
this
if
the
hops
were
more
present
to
go
along
with
the
floral
sweetness
this
could
be
a
monster
not
bad
but
honestly
for
a
seasoned
craft
drinker
its
a
waste
of
time
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
ring
of
a
head
which
leaves
a
little
bit
of
finger
lace
the
aroma
is
faint
and
of
a
slight
sweet
belgian
yeast
strain
along
with
some
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
as
well
as
a
sweet
malt
backbone
there
is
the
addition
of
a
floral
hop
bite
in
the
middle
to
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
and
slightly
stingy
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
it
is
for
sure
not
up
there
with
the
best
in
class
the
taste
was
better
than
the
look
and
smell
which
saves
it
a
little
bit
a
decent
beer
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
mild
sour
in
combination
with
the
banana
fruitiness
are
where
they
should
be
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
lasts
for
a
good
10
minutes
the
aroma
is
more
malty
with
some
earthy
elements
the
taste
is
kinda
malty
with
some
grain
and
grass
and
a
bit
of
fruit
this
seems
like
a
light
version
of
the
style
its
passable
but
theres
plenty
better
poured
into
a
stem
glass
a
light
golden
amber
clear
with
a
small

disappears

with
a
touch

and
candiish
sugar
followed
by
subtle
melon
and
pear
flavors
finishing
off
with
some
earthy
hops
that
dont
really
take
over
they
just
make
their
presence
known
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
pretty
good
drink
overall
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
trace
of
head
that
dissipated
rapidly
the
aroma
has
notes
of
floral
honey
and
caramel
the
taste
starts
caramel
sweet
and
then
becomes
floral
hoppy
while
finishing
slightly
bitter
all
pretty
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
overcharged
and
leaves
a
dry
grainy
feeling
in

throat
not
pleasant

but
a
little
watery
and
lacking
in

easy
enough
to
drink
though
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
the
head
wasnt
too
big
or
anything
average
at
best
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
big
belgian
yeast
aroma
going
on
there
was
also
a
bit
of
sweetness
too
the
taste
was
mostly
yeasty
a
light
banana
flavor
and
a
hint
of
sweet
honey
in
the
background
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
wasnt

bad
it
was
pretty
smooth
overall
i
wouldnt
have
to
buy
this
one
again
overall
wouldnt
be
the
first
thing
i
would
grab
again
but
definitely
washed
the
taste
from
that
lackluster
victory
weissbier
offering
pretty
good
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
than
belgian
in
style
the
yeast
could
be
more
pronounced
given
that
is
how
its
marketed
all
in
all
pretty
meh
mouthfeel
wet
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
its
pretty
good
i
would
say
for
a
session
beer
there
are
like
no
distinguishing
characteristics
andor
strong
flavors
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
very
mild
across
the
board
on
tap
at
the
bridge
in
st
louis
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
clear
copper
pour
and
gave
an
offwhite
head
that
faded
quickly
medium
carbonation
left
some
spots
and
fingers
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aromas
were
faint
apple
other
fruit
i
could
not
place
and
some
fruit
offness
like
vegetables
cooked

the
flavors
were
faint

apple
bruised
apple
and
pear

this
beer
had

flavor
and
was
not
exciting
pours
transparent
pale
gold
in
hue
with
a
great
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
behind
subtle
aroma
of
hop
spice
grain
and
medicinal
undertones
tastes
of
hop
spice
grain
some
adjuncts
wheat
dry
with
some
bitter

the
finish
and
some
belgian
candy
sugar
in
a
baby
seat
in
the
back
thick
and
dull
in
the
mouthfeel
and
makes
those
flavors
fall
flat
on
the
palate
sadly
this
beer
comes
across
like
craft
beer
from
a
macrobrewerys
perspective
the
beer
doesnt
represent
avery
at
its
best
overall
solid
and
quite
enjoyable
but
not
outstanding
lets
hope
oklahoma
replaces

o
a
very
disappointing
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
after
tasting
a
few
other
beers
from
avery
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
them
i
know
ill
never
buy
this
beer
again
almost
but
not
quite
a
drain
pour
this
is
a
pretty
weird
brew
i
cannot
say
that
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
hop
character
and
the
belgian
aspect
seems
pretty
lost
on
me
still
this
brew
manages
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
is
very
drinkable
ouch
if
karma
is
real
what
did
i
do
to
deserve
this
upon
my
palate
in
all
seriousness
this
lacks
the
quality
of
a
well
layered
belgian
pale
malts
and
hops
are
chosen
well
but
the
spice
profile
and
yeast
additions
seem
to
break
it
apart
will
avoid
in
the

a

pale

to
be
had
out
there
a
mediocre

at

od
easy

beer
easy
drinking
flavors
are
just
a
too
light
and
b
just
dont
feel
to
style
im
looking
for
more
belgian
character
in
a
beer
like
this
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
as
a
nice
summer
quaffer
o
there
are
some
good
qualities
to
the
beer
its
not
all
that
bad
tasting
just
a
little
weird
average
in
my
book
o
decent
enough
tasting
not
what
i
expect
in
a
bpa
overall
i
am
stunned
avery
continues
to
brew
this
mess
glad
i
bought
a
single
but
still
had
to
drain
pour
half
of
it
the
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
the
taste
is
too
it
has
a
slight
odd
yeast
taste
but
a
nice
hops
balance
there
is
a
slight
afterbite
and
it
gets
nastier
as
you
go
i
hope
to
avoid
this
in
the
future
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
d
an
okay
beer
overall
doesnt
portray
belgium
ipas
very
well
nor
american
stylistic
impression
either
easy
drinking
but
lacks
the
yeast
profile
to
really
sink
in
as
a
great
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
this
is
on
the
lower
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
bunch
of
carbonation
and
somewhat
dry
in
the
mouth
wasnt
horrible
but
would
not
recommend
or
revisit
d
easy
to
throw
back
and
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
beginner
in
micros
i
would
purchase
a
sixer
for
a
gathering
notes
not
really
sure
what
to
say
about
this
its
beer
for
sure
but
doesnt
really
wow
me
i
suppose
if
given
the
opportunity
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
dont
think
id
ever
seek
it
out
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
lacks
some
balance
with
regard
to
the
esters
this
would
really
keep
me
from
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
and
in
comparison
to
other
belgian
pale
ales
this
would
probably
not
be
the
first
on
my
list
especially
from
avery
they
have
so
many
other
fine
selections
d
this
is
dlicious
good
karma
drinkability
decent
enough
in
taste
but
not
terribly
complex
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
nose
brings
some
bready
malt
hints
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
as
well
as
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
taste
brings
a
bit
of
spice
along
with
pale
doughy
malt
and
a
bit
of
floral
bitterness
feel
is
like
with
moderate
carbonation
drinks
okay
but
doesnt
even
come
close
to
comparing
to
belgian
examples
of
the
style
nor
a
few
select
american
versions
d
very
light
flavors
again
heavier
hopping
would
do
wonders
very
drinkable
nonetheless
forgettable
yet
sessionable
and
smooth
is
the
verdict
on
this
one
im
still
wondering
if
this
is
old
so
ill
score
it
as
is
but
also
give
it
another
go
sometime
in
the
future
in
order
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
its
not
holding
what
i
would
think
would
be
traditional
oxidized
flavors
cardboard
staleness
dating
on
the
bottle
would
be
helpful
avery
karma
pours
a
dark
yellowish
orange
this
beer
has
such
a
rich
color
it
is
a
little
cloudy
as
well
the
head
was
thin
but
it
wont
go
away
it
has
sweet
and
caramel
malts
there
are
some
flower
popery
like
qualities
hidden
on
the
end
of
the
nose
the
first
thing
i
taste
are
oranges
the
sweet
malt
show
up
after
that
with
some
citrus
hops
on
the
end
some
dried
mango
lingers
on
the
finish
i
was
surprised
how
drinkable
this
beer
was
i
found
that
it
would
be
perfect
in
the
spring
or
fall
when
the
evenings
are
still
cool
honestly
i
think
this
beer
has
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
little
too
long
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
flowery
hops
with
some
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
grapes
flowers
and
oranges
with
some
lighter
malts
a
very
fruity
tasting
belgian
ale
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
creamy
nice
carb
and
good
overall
so
i
guess
this
was
a
great
beer
to
revisit
to
note
how
far
my
palate
and
experience
has
come
in
the
last
4
or
5
years
while
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
its
hugely
mediocre
and
doesnt
taste
like
it
should
given
the
description
from
the
brewer
it
may
be
time
to
stop
believing
in
karma
adam
and
the
avery
crew
i
didnt
know
what
style
it
was
when
i
had
itkind
of
struck
me
as
a
fruity
light
brown
ale
if
that
makes
sense
nothing
bad
here
just
kind
of
bland
and
one
dimensional
i
love
avery
but
this
is
a
miss
for
me
the
yeast
was
there
but
didnt
shine
as
id
hoped
it
has
an
odd
finish
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
an
average
bpa
found
at
the
timberline
steakhouse
at
denver
airport
this
brew
exhibits
a
crystal
clear
darkish
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
even
better
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
clove
and
bright
wheat
the
flavor
is
a
very
pleasant
blend
of
grasscitrus
hop
and
light
malt
clove
its
perfectly
carbonated
for
a
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
in
a
mediumlight
bodied
brew
its
very
drinkable
sessionable
while
providing
a
belgian
hint
i
think
anyone
might
enjoy
this
beer
with
a
quality
feel
and
mild
but
tasteful
flavoring
which
includes
a
subtle
hop
overtone
that
finishes
just
a
bit
dry
i
would
drink
this
anytime
but
it
does
not
deliver
a
big
flavor
or
highly
memorable
kick
good
stuff
though
typical
of
what
we
come
to
expect
from
avery
d
a
easy
to
drink
beer
just
seemed
off
or
maybe
a
bit
outta
balance
i
dont
really
see
me
drinking
this
one
too
often
or
again
d
very
smooth
going
down
and
enjoyable
a
great
amount
of
flavor
for
just
over
5
abv
what
youre
left
with
is
a
perfectly
inoffensive
beer
with
not
much
to
recommend
neither
hoppy
nor
malty
nor
fruity
d
very
good
could
be
real
easy
to
suck
down
pours
a
darker
clear
copper
color
with
filmy
white
head
mild
aroma
of
spice
and
yeast
tastes
of
fruit
apple
spices
and
yeast
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
and
some
astringent
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
light
bodied
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
d
great
tasting
and
a
good
pale
ale
drinkability
for
me
not
high
just
tastes
like
one
or
two
at
a
time
a
very
middle
of
the
road
beer
a
bit
to
esthery
for
my
tastes
but
nothing
offputting
md
very
light
body
and
good
carbonation
12oz
bottle
poured
a
stiff
white
head
aroma
was
very
light
unfortunately
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
the
whole
experience
was
a
little
too
understated
perhaps
the
beer
anticipated
my
own
karma
the
flavor
was
also
light
with
mild
apricot
and
honey
up
front
blending
into
rather
sour
citrus
taste
dandelion
finish
pleasant
but
unmemorable
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
actually
body
is
decent
at
medium
and
pretty
clean
not
sure
ill
have
this
one
again
d
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
i
thought
it
smelled
pretty
good
and
like
a
normal
belgian
ale
but
thought
the
taste
was
nothing
like
a
belgian
and
nothing
special
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
but
dont
think
i
would
want
to
wouldnt
look
to
have
again
goes
down
barely
average
missed
the
mark
a
bit
for
me
not
as
yeasty
as
i
expected
nor
as
hoppy
d
this
is
not
a
prime
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
its
sessionability
is
through
the
roof
very
drinkable
and
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
worth
a
try
d
it
is
a
good
beer
and
enjoyable
summer
ale
pours
a
deep
rich
golden
color
with
a
good
collar
of
white
foam
aromas
of
bananas
and
cloves
and
belgian
yeast
i
was
expecting
something
similar
when
i
tried
it
but
i
was
surprised
by
flavors
of
peaches
apricots
and
bubble
gum
a
really
good
and
refreshing
beer
for
the
upcoming
summer
months
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
and
good
tasting
beer
nothing
really
surprising
but
definitely
worthwhile
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
karma
pours
noticeably
dark
for
a
pale
ale
and
for
a
belgian
style
beer
the
lackluster
headlacing
is
especially
disappointing
the
smell
is
a
bit
better
a
blend
of
caramel
and
yeast
spiciness
the
taste
takes
those
elements
and
adds
a
distinct
orange
note
as
well
as
a
subtle
funk
to
the
mix
to
good
effect
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
lacking
and
the
body
is
solid
without
being
in
any
way
impressive
it
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
fuller
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
just
keeps
it
from
being
too
drinkable
i
think
ill
chalk
it
up
to
the
aforementioned
mouthfeel
issues
karma
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
options
within
the
style
serving
type
bottle
d
not
a
belgian
pale
ale
like
advertised
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
aspect
but
nothing
is
bad
here
not
a
bad
belgianstyled
ale
its
certainly
unique
among
american
interpretations
that
said
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
meek
and
it
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
i
am
debating
pouring
this
overall
i
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
not
horrible
but
its
struggling
to
be
average
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
the
low
abv
followed
with
the
watery
mouthfeel
creates
a
perfect
combination
for
this
beer
to
be
extremely
sessionable
i
just
dont
know
if
i
like
it
enough
though
as
far
as
the
overall
beer
goes
its
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
which
when
nothing
too
exciting
is
happening
isnt
a
bad
thing
good
beer
would
look
to
find
this
one
again
too
rich
for
the
style
as
they
tried
a
bit
too
hard
here
yeast
notes
are
a
bit
odd
im
not
feeling
the
karma
apparently
i
really
like
this
style
but
miss
the
elegant
and
refined
yeast
notes
more
common
in
the
stalwarts
of
the
style
a
good
beer
nonetheless
though
a
bit
malty
and
nondescript
double
it
up
and
make
a
tripel
i
say
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
very
smooth
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
thanks
to
kstrickler
a
great
trader
for
this
one
the
body
was
good
solid
but
not
heavy
tongue
coating
without
being
sticky
or
lingering
drinkability
was
good
but
i
just
cant
see
having
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
of
these
this
is
a
tasty
and
interesting
brew
one
thats
worth
your
time
but
doesnt
really
grab
your
attention
good
brew
this
one
was
made
for
early
summer
evenings
a
great
session
beer
a
very
americanstyle
bpa
but
i
like
it
very
much
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
that
uses
pepper
in
place
of
hops
for
balance
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
not
too
spicy
and
not
too
sweet
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
when
i
first
smelt
this
beer
it
reminded
me
of
strawberry
poptarts
really
the
taste
was
very
light
and
had
a
dried
strawberry
taste
similar
to
the
smell
there
was
very
little
bitterness
and
the
aftertaste
dissipated
quickly
it
is
very
interesting
what
flavors
yeast
can
produce
the
color
is
golden
and
orange
with
a
white
head
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
high
session
beer
i
could
down
a
6
pack
of
this
easily
it
is
very
nice
and
could
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
people
who
only
drink
light
beers
it
would
also
go
very
well
with
sushi
because
it
has
very
little
aftertaste
great
beer
people
may
not
rave
about
this
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
from
avery
smells
of
grains
and
dried
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
thrown
in
the
taste
leans
towards
banana
with
the
graininess
asserting
itself
more
in
the
aftertaste
finishes
sweet
and
a
little
soapy
not
very
aggressive
or
ambitious
on
any
front
but
a
good
easy
drinking
belgian
session
beer
as
a
side
note
the
beer
held
up
well
to
the
different
flavors
of
thanksgiving
including
turkey
and
sweet
potatoes
but
also
leftover
turkey
served
as
a
thai
style
curry
remember
good
things
do
happen
to
good
people
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
one
first
avery
beer
that
has
left
me
wondering
what
happened
d
i
honestly
didnt
enjoy
this
that
much
it
felt
like
it
could
use
about
a
50
flavor
boost
the
light
body
does
make
an
easy
drinker
d
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
beer
all
other
avery
beers
ive
had
have
been
pretty
tasty
this
one
isnt
bad
however
nothing
too
exciting
really
either
drinkability
is
good
3
5
d
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
avery
and
this
beer
does
nothing
to
change
that
d
good
but
not
amazing
a
good
brew
but
not
something
i
am
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
decent
drinkable
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
moredifferent
malt
flavors
would
bring
it
better
balance
very
drinkable
but
too
much
fruit
its
like
a
wine
cooler
very
much
an
americanized
belgian
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
poured
into
a
10oz
weizen
glass
orangecopper
hue
with
very
good
carbonation
but
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
citrus
fruity
mixed
with
some
clovelike
spiciness
but
i
expected
a
little
more
given
the
belgian
yeast
strain
used
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
nose
at
the
start
but
it
was
followed
up
by
a
crisp
mildly
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
although
i
think
that
the
excessive
carbonation
took
away
from
the
flavor
a
tad
a
nice
crisp
easydrinking
beer
d
karma
is
nothing
remarkable
or
mindblowing
but
it
is
pretty
drinkable
decent
flavors
going
on
even
if
somewhat
restrained
a
reasonable
quaffer
with
some
belgian
flare
at
a
low
abv
with
a
decent
balance
and
flavor
this
ones
got
plenty
of
drinkability
there
are
certainly
belgian
pales
id
pick
out
first
but
this
isnt
one
to
scorn
by
any
means
mouthfeel
is
about
average
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
fairly
pleasant
experience
but
nothing
stands
out
avery
has
spoiled
us
with
some
mindblowing
beers
and
their
average
is
better
than
most
other
brewers
average
if
i
compare
karma
to
what
a
magic
hat
belgian
pale
ale
might
taste
like
its
not
really
a
slam
on
magic
hat
but
m
h
stuff
rarely
touches
the
heights
of
avery
so
its
weird
to
see
avery
release
something
on
this
level
decent
drinkability
as
theres
nothing
way
off
or
offensive
here
and
the
alcohol
level
is
reasonable
its
just
not
that
tasty
its
leagues
below
what
they
were
shooting
for
and
i
personally
wouldnt
return
my
least
favorite
avery
beer
by
a
wide
margin
conclusion
averys
brews
are
very
hitormiss
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
misses
its
just
not
all
that
good
imo
slightly
hazy
ambercopper
colored
body
light
tan
head
it
smells
very
fruity
to
me
mango
and
citrus
aromas
are
especially
strong
belgian
yeast
taste
maybe
a
little
apple
as
well
spicy
yeast
in
the
finish
d
overall
a
good
beer
one
i
would
recommend
to
at
least
try
d
a
solid
representative
of
a
style
i
feel
is
underbrewed
in
the
us
not
stellar
but
pretty
good
i
would
like
a
bit
more
yeast
character
and
this
is
a
winner
ill
buy
it
again
though
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
nice
solid
belgian
pale
ale
d
the
hard
to
pin
down
as
belgian
style
ignored
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
summer
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
rather
dark
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
smells
of
phenolic
yeast
strain
taste
is
light
salty
with
a
thin
crisp
malt
middle
a
hint
of
pepper
and
banana
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
average
carbonation
levels
drinkability
is
good
very
light
and
unoffensive
but
not
that
much
flavor
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
specifically
seek
it
out
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
a
bit
too
much
by
the
end
there
is
a
juxtaposition
of
prickly
carbonation
and
carbonation
that
has
become
creamy
d
not
bad
pretty
easy
drinker
kind
of
refreshing
slightly
above
average
brew
not
too
overpowering
would
be
great
intro
brew
to
those
who
usually
drink
budmillercoors
although
it
doesnt
last
too
long
not
too
thrilled
with
the
mildly
peppery
slightly
tinny
aftertaste
while
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
belgian
pale
it
just
doesnt
make
me
want
to
have
another
though
one
drank
fine
enough
i
suppose
not
too
crazy
about
how
things
came
together
here
a
bit
watery
and
if
they
were
going
for
marginally
belgianesque
well
thats
what
it
is
karma
surprised
me
by
how
good
and
drinkable
it
is
the
overall
balance
of
flavors
is
so
well
done
that
it
keeps
the
ale
very
satisfying
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
drinks
pretty
well
some
of
the
spice
makes
it
tougher
to
get
down
at
times
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
much
better
with
food
d
not
in
the
league
of
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
and
not
really
on
target
for
the
style
not
yeasty
not
crisp
not
sharp
hops
flavors
but
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
m
d
just
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
along
with
a
smooth
medium
body
nice
enough
flavour
mellow
drinking
experience
its
a
solid
accessible
beer
if
nothing
else
not
too
shabby
light
to
medium
bodied
leaning
toward
light
smooth
and
almost
creamy
with
a
bit
of
oily
slickness
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
off
aftertaste
but
the
light
fruitiness
of
this
beer
helps
notes
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
smells
and
tastes
ok
and
goes
down
really
easy
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
but
i
wont
hold
this
one
against
avery
there
are
simply
too
many
good
belgian
pales
out
there
to
justify
buying
this
on
the
regular
karma
is
a
disappointing
bspa
it
doesnt
have
enough
good
bspa
qualities
to
succeed
for
the
style
the
nose
is
a
little
misleading
and
the
flavor
seems
off
theres
not
enough
of
a
yeast
presence
and
the
spicy
aspect
is
very
mediocre
averys
a
good
brewery
and
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
their
better
releases
a
couple
of
modifications
would
improve
it
but
im
still
doubtful
that
itd
be
competitive
with
some
of
the
great
bspas
out
there
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
kickass
bspa
just
go
get
a
real
one
avery
karma
is
a
cloudy
sparkling
amber
ale
with
a
thick
fluffy
yellowish
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
bread
bananaclove
and
slightly
sweet
malt
it
is
mediumlight
bodied
bubbly
and
fluffy
with
a
clean
dry
finish
it
is
lightly
flavored
with
not
much
bitterness
there
is
a
little
spice
pepper
and
phenol
in
the
taste
its
pretty
well
blended
and
unoffensive
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
stronger
yeast
flavor
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
raw
grain
base
with
a
mild
hop
that
doesnt
really
give
much
bitterness
the
body
is
as
expected
d
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
again
this
is
the
first
avery
that
left
me
somewhat
underwhelmed
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
fairly
unique
does
not
taste
like
most
bpas
i
have
had
seems
to
have
a
high
level
of
specialty
grains
as
the
maltiness
is
quite
noticeable
has
kind
of
a
biscuity
and
white
bread
flavor
a
fair
amount
of
belgian
yeasty
esters
but
certainly
not
an
overabundance
finish
has
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
and
maybe
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
but
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
and
will
have
no
problem
finishing
off
the
sixer
makes
a
nicely
priced
alternative
to
some
of
the
pricier
belgians
d
as
a
said
previously
i
was
looking
for
something
to
drink
a
bunch
of
all
night
and
thats
exactly
what
i
got
overall
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
belgium
entry
from
one
of
my
favorite
and
local
micros
avery
has
done
it
again
d
i
have
read
many
less
positive
reviews
on
this
site
assuming
that
the
quality
is
maintained
in
this
brew
since
my
first
sampling
here
then
i
can
say
that
this
can
easily
become
my
new
favorite
session
beer
understanding
that
i
am
stretching
the
limits
of
the
word
session
it
has
yeasty
bread
like
aroma
with
lots
of
malt
with
some
essence
of
hops
in
it
the
smell
reminds
be
of
raw
bread
dough
it
pours
beautiful
into
my
pint
glass
it
has
a
very
frothy
head
and
thick
lace
the
foamy
is
a
golden
creamy
color
the
body
is
a
hazy
brass
color
it
has
a
vegetable
and
fruit
like
taste
it
is
earthy
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
farmhouse
ale
i
drank
this
with
some
indian
cuisine
chicken
masala
and
it
went
perfectly
with
it
the
hop
flavors
cut
through
the
strong
spicy
indian
food
flavors
and
complemented
my
meal
nicely
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
drink
it
again
d
if
youre
looking
for
a
belgian
probably
not
the
best
representation
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
then
karma
is
what
you
are
looking
for
d
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
dont
remember
not
liking
it
this
much
this
beer
is
a
little
too
dry
and
astringent
for
me
to
drink
a
few
d
one
bottle
will
be
fine
for
me
not
my
favorite
avery
offering
if
this
was
labeled
as
an
american
belgian
pale
ale
i
think
id
be
up
to
4
5s
for
a
lot
of
these
i
can
see
why
people
dont
think
as
well
of
this
but
for
belgian
beginners
such
as
myself
this
is
a
nice
intermediate
that
wont
taste
like
im
trying
to
gulp
down
shoe
polish
deeper
orange
coloration
a
flurry
of
bubbles
on
the
first
pour
one
finger
of
foam
partial
ringed
lacing
the
head
fades
quickly
to
a
skim
and
then
into
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
is
yeast
based
and
is
a
little
bit
estery
light
and
sweet
orange
note
tastes
like
candy
orange
slices
or
even
hawaiian
punch
with
a
biscuit
malt
in
the
background
citrus
doesnt
seem
hopderived
but
there
could
be
some
flavor
hops
in
there
somewhere
carbonation
is
fuzzy
upfront
with
some
astringency
and
is
flat
a
second
later
once
it
hits
the
palate
not
much
complexity
if
youre
a
fan
of
orangeflavored
beer
this
may
be
the
session
beer
for
you

not

mouthfeel
for
the

lacking
in

that
would
set
this
apart
as
a
belgian

altogether
this
is
like
a

aroma
is
somewhat

and
sweet
with
a
nice

color
is
a
copper
brown
and
the

wonderful

character
with
plenty
of

yeast
flavor
and
an
alcohol
kick
that
i
was
not
expecting
in
a
5
2
ale
it
has
a
near
perfect
amount
of
hops
as
well

is

finding
the

no
yeasty
flavors
it
is
lightly
sweetened
with
caramel
malts
being
the
backbonethis
seems
to
need
a
third
dimension
that
is
no
where
to
be
seen
the
hops
detected
in
the
nose
are
just
as
understated
on
the
pallet
i
do
taste
a
slight
tangerine
sweetness
on
the
tailtho
i
dont
really
enjoy
it
all
that
much
the
body
is
appropriate
as
is
the
carbonation
and
finish
i
could
see
this
as
more
drinkable
perhaps
with
a
meal
a
decent
brew
and
worth
a
tryjust
not
that
special
deep
amber
with
light
reddish
hues
and
a
somewhat
thinnish

to

somewhat

a

definite
sweetness
in
the
taste
a
little
tea
like
very
light
belgian
influence
with
the
yeast
but
not
too
obvious
or
similar
to
a
bpa
in
my
book
just
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
crispness
and
nibble
on
the
tongue
a
little
drying
in
the
finish
but
early
it
seems
watery
pretty
drinkable
overall
but
there
are
better
brews
out
there
good
beer
however
the
last
of
them
lingered
in
my
fridge
for
awhile
this
usually
means
i
dont
quite
love
it
and
forget
about
it
after
drinking
most
of
the
pack
but
enjoy
the
last
one
or
two
when
i
see
the
last
of
them
behind
a
carton
of
milk

pours
a
golden

slighty

taste
medium

light
body
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
outstanding
with
this
belgian
pale
d
its
definitely
a
difficult
thing
to
recreate
a
belgianstyle
beer
in
the
u
s
that
much
we
know
this
one
just
doesnt
come
close
its
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
certainly
expected
better
with
the
malt
taking
the
lead
in
the
taste
the
honeyish
characteristics
come
out
more
in
the
flavor
grabbing
right
on
tight
to
it
as
the
beer
warms
touches
of
vanilla
show
up
and
theres
a
light
hop
and
pepper
qualities
in
the
semi
dry
finish
as
a
whole
a
little
more
complexity
would
be
cool
but
it
has
enough
to
make
it
interesting
drinkability
is
pretty
high
although
i
only
had
the
one
bottle
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
bbqs
thirst
quenching
enough
flavor
to
stand
up
to
grilled
food
and
what
its
belgian
brethren
lack
value
packaged
if
i
hadnt
been
drinking
my
homebrewed
saison
all
summer
i
would
have
probably
leaned
on
this
i
really
dig
such
full
flavor
and
reasonable
abv
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
row
but
thats
it
easy
to
drink
cloudy
amber
colored
beer
with
a
very
slow
fading
head
aroma
is
hoppy
and
citrusy
taste
also
is
citrusbanana
and
perhaps
a
smidge
of
cherries
this
is
an
ok
beer
thats
not
going
to
blow
anybody
away
i
might
try
again
but
there
are
still
many
many
other
beers
to
try
overall
a
decent
brew
an
easy
to
drink
with
a
cool
label
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
nothing
special
but
worth
a
try
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
the
beer
is
lacing
pretty
well
too
avery
karma
pours
a
dark
orangish
peach
with
a
short
lasting
fuzzy
head
the
smell
is
faint
and
bitter
taste
is
pleasant
for
the
most
part
its
lightly
hopped
with
a
faint
bitter
after
taste
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
carbonation
with
a
smooth
bubbly
feel
overall
drinkability
is
ok
but
for
the
most
part
it
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
is
this
brew
is
worth
trying
by
adding
a
single
to
a
mixed
six
pack
but
a
full
six
is
probably
more
that
most
would
want
to
try
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
is
ok
here
as
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
somewhere
to
reasses
my
review
could
be
a
good
session
beer
i
would
have
a
problem
with
the
hoppy
bite
it
has
but
could
probably
get
around
it
as
it
is
minimal
i
might
buy
another
single
of
this
brew
but
never
a
sixer
or
a
case
another
case
of
where
looks
are
deceiving
this
is
a
below
average
beer
and
a
really
poor
example
of
a
belgian
ale
pour
was
delightful
nice
copper
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
nice
lacing
and
steady
carbonation
aroma
is
weak
but
a
sweetness
can
be
detected
and
thats
it
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
thin
with
a
really
watery
finish
flavor
is
really
mild
and
uneventful
as
i
drink
this
i
keep
telling
myself
that
there
is
nothing
here
hard
to
describe
except
that
its
very
weak
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
some
good
lacing
and
nice
head
it
had
a
very
nice
hoppy
if
not
strong
or
deep
aroma
although
with
very
little
else
to
it
nice
taste
slightly
hoppy
along
the
lines
of
a
weaker
esb
but
again
like
the
scent
nothing
strong
just
a
good
decent
pale
ale
it
went
down
very
nicely
however
a
very
smooth
beer
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
grassy
yeasty
lime
hops
with
barley
malt
it
tasted
like
yeasty
lemon
hops
with
earthy
malt
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
somewhat
typical
of
a
belgian
ale
it
was
clean
and
easy
to
drink
but
just
wasnt
terribly
enjoyable
dnot
a
bad
beer
i
suppose
just
not
a
whole
bunch
of
flavor
not
to
much
else
to
say
if
that
says
anything
d
an
ok
beer
fairly
complex
flavor
not
bad
for
a
light
belgian
style
brew
easy
drinking
very
accessible
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
offer
people
who
have
only
had
macro
lagers
previously
it
is
a
craft
beer
it
is
slightly
darker
than
lagers
and
there
isnt
anything
there
for
anyone
to
dislike
its
not
even
as
flavorful
as
sierra
pale
ale
or
even
sam
adamsthe
two
most
common
transitionfromjunktogoodbeer
beers
its
not
hoppy
at
all
though
so
it
would
be
a
better
choice
for
transitioning
to
belgian
styles
this
was
my
first
belgian
pale
so
my
review
might
be
a
little
off
it
was
a
little
darker
than
i
was
expecting
a
nice
kick
from
the
hops
were
immediately
noticeable
but
then
this
sort
of
weird
vibe
i
couldnt
really
identify
malts
where
i
wasnt
expecting
any
it
just
didnt
have
the
balance
that
i
was
looking
for
not
to
be
avoided
and
not
to
be
sought
out
drinkability
is
really
poor
surprising
that
this
category
can
some
of
my
favorite
beers
and
also
some
of
the
worst
example
take
a
pass
i
always
anticipate
when
a
new
avery
hits
the
shelf
this
one
pours
a
reddish
orange
and
is
topped
off
by
an
offwhite
twofinger
head
that
fades
somewhat
expediently
and
leaves
a
swirly
line
of
lacing
behind
smells
of
sweet
malts
oranges
grapefruit
pears
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
citrusy
theres
some
toastiness
involved
along
with
a
slight
almost
unnoticeable
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
average
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
avery
seems
to
hit
triples
and
homers
with
their
bigger
brews
and
singles
and
doubles
with
their
smaller
brews
while
this
is
a
good
brew
that
i
really
cant
find
fault
with
its
not
on
par
with
some
of
their
other
offerings
that
being
said
it
is
very
possible
that
the
magnitude
of
their
bigger
beers
could
be
skewing
my
perception
either
way
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
that
should
please
any
palate
pours
a
very
clear
light
copperorange
color
with
a
pleasant
12
inch
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
film
of
a
layer
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
low
side
smell
is
great
sweet
malty
notes
of
candied
cherries
alcohol
and
something
else
that
i
cant
grasp
mouth
feel
is
light
to
med
light
once
its
in
the
mouth
it
is
deceiving
in
that
it
feels
bigger
than
it
really
is
the
sweet
malts
are
much
tamer
and
some
spicey
hops
come
into
play
for
balance
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
weak
but
this
doesnt
detract
from
the
overall
experience
too
much
d
could
enjoy
a
few
the
aftertaste
is
not
as
bad
as
it
seems
but
is
easily
drinkable
i
had
higher
expectations
from
avery
they
make
some
incredible
beers
pretty
much
anything
in
a
bomber
is
top
tier
this
however
was
kind
of
weak
d
not
terribly
impressed
it
was
ok
or
average
try
it
it
may
be
your
cats
meow
d
good
in
taste
but
i
expect
more
ester
to
shine
through
interesting
combination
of
flavors
but
not
really
anything
that
id
go
crazy
over
also
it
is
slightly
lacking
in
auroma
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
locate
pours
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
dissipated
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
not
getting
much
out
of
it
some
sweet
malt
perhaps
a
touch
of
grain
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
toasted
cracker
with
a
grassy
hop
and
tart
apple
flavor
towards
the
end
not
sure
whats
belgian
about
this
brew
neither
the
yeast
profile
nor
any
candi
sugar
profiles
come
through
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
finishes
slightly
sweet
a
very
neutral
beer
a
nice
balance
makes
this
drinkable
but
it
doesnt
resemble
a
belgian
brew
decent
stuff
from
avery
but
certainly
not
this
brewerys
best
effort
d
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
session
beer
the
aroma
qualities
are
nice
but
the
flavor
is
kind
of
lacking
it
is
a
bit
maltier
than
i
would
have
expected
and
kind
of
lacking
in
yeast
character
solid
medium
body
and
a
smooth
carbonation
i
had
three
in
one
sitting
and
that
was
good
for
the
night
but
i
would
sure
like
to
get
more
not
real
drinkable
beer
flavors
are
overpowering
and
the
whiskey
flavor
is
not
my
pint
of
ale
ill
probably
pass
this
one
up
again
an
inoffensive
beer
that
seems
like
a
macro
attempt
at
a
craft
blah
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
all
over
the
map
with
a
nod
to
each
of
the
major
beer
centers
of
england
germany
and
belgium
a
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
belgianesque
head
sweet
fruity
malts
with
some
carmelized
sugars
and
faint
belgian
spices
the
taste
has
soft
caramel
malts
and
some
light
fruits
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
spicy
yeast
and
hop
characteristics
body
is
light
with
soft
carbonation
a
mellow
and
drinkable
beer
more
of
a
blond
ale
but
good
this
one
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
orangish
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
sweet
fruity
and
yeasty
very
inviting
and
powerful
the
taste
is
very
powerful
upfront
with
a
sweet
yeasty
flavor
and
other
small
notes
there
is
very
little
aftertaste
the
flavors
just
fade
away
quickly
leaving
you
wanting
another
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
balance
nice
medium
light
body
this
one
is
any
easy
drinker
great
for
any
occasion
a
beer
definitely
worth
checking
out
avery
brings
us
an
ale
with
good
karma
as
well
as
taste
enjoyed
it
in
a
small

this
beer
was
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
your
girlfriend
might
even
like
it
d
i
have
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
this
was
tons
better
on
tap
super
drinkable
and
a
great
session

great
especially
at
the

nice

with
lots
of

not
a
bad
try
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
the
best
versions
feels
creamy
and
thick
slightly
bubbly
but
smooth
overall
its
highly
drinkable
mild
and
dry
a
nice
sweet

honey

the

drinkability
quite
clean
smooth

drinkable
the
color
was
a
medium
light
hazy
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
foam
that
dissapated
in
a
few
seconds
an
no
lace
the
smell
was
of
a
sweet
spicy
fruity
aroma
with
a
mild
hop
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
a
bitter
hoppy
and
with
a
caramel
aftertaste
the
smell
was
better
than
the
finish
product
but
overall
it
was
just
an
above
average
belgium
ale
all
in
all
a
fairly
good
beer
that
is
smooth
somewhat
creamy
and
nicely
flavored
a
few
tweaks
could
bounce
this
up
quite
a
bit
but
its
worth
trying
poured
a
hazy
orange
to
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
that
quickly
went
away
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
caramel
and
yeast
the
taste
was
more
malty
than
of
hops
with
the
caramel
and
molasses
not
bad
but
not
up
to
par
with
some
of
averys
other
offerings

enough
taste
to
stay
interested
a
good
belgian
for
newbie
to
belgians
d
nice
summer
brew
i
will
revisit
too
bad
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
at
broudys
at
cobblestone
in
st
augustine
fl
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
some
more
medium
in
feel
fizzy
sodalike
co2
initially
then
its
grows
flat
and
semisticky
and
generally
repulsive
drinkability
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
im
just
used
to
more
flavor
especially
from
avery
very
tasty
and
good
drinkability
certainly
not
true
to
what
i
think
of
a
belgian
pa
but
a
good
americanized
take
on
it
a
little
bit
of
an
offputting
bitterness
to
the
beer
a
little
dry
tannins
get
in
the
way
as
the
beer
warms
the
karma
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
short
foam
head
and
some
dialed
in
lacing
the
aroma
was
spicy
but
couldnt
pull
much
else
out
the
flavor
was
malt
dominated
with
a
lemony
taste
to
it
in
the
mouth
it
finishes
spicy
and
leaves
a
mark
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
style
pale
ale
overall
this
beer
was
a
disappointment
just
not
enough
character
finish
is
nice
and
mellow
no
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable

good
alternative
to
bmc

pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
im
not
getting
much
from
the
aroma
some
sweet
malt
is
noticeable
lots
of
sweet
malt
some
hops
and
some
citrus
are
what
come
through
in
the
flavor
to
me
a
decent
beer
but
not
very
exciting
worth
a
try
the
pour
was
a
golden
coppery
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
fruityapples
with
hints
of
bananas
and
spices
the
taste
was
fruits
and
bready
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
drinkability
was
good
i
actually
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
drinkability
not
too
bad
but
seemed
to
be
missing
that
facet
of
character
that
would
make
it
stand
out
d
an
ok
beer
not
one
of
averys
best
but
drinkable
and
thirstquenching
even
though
there
was
not
as
much
complexity
as
i
had
hoped
for
overall
would
be
good
to
have
one
or
two
but
the
ester
character
is
too
much
for
many
more
than
that
pours
out
a
slightly
hazed
and
effervescent
copper
with
a
tight
and
foamy
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
smell
is
really
faint
with
some
soft
caramel
malts
a
touch
of
toast
and
some
spicy
and
fruity
esters
i
get
a
good
deal
of
banana
flavor
is
just
so
faint
with
really
tame
malts
and
with
the
yeasty
esters
and
phenols
overtaking
what
little
grain
backbone
is
there
turns
watery
toward
the
end
of
each
sip
just
kind
of
bland
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
fizzy
yet
has
a
bit
of
a
sticky
edge
overall
this
is
not
impressive
but
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
easily

and
spice
but
not
very
bitter
or
overdone
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
from
avery
the
taste
is
very
mellow
sweet
malt
and
fruity
esters
with
a
little
yeast
nothing
pronounced
or
overwhelming
it
goes
done
easy
crisp
and

some
green

syrupy
feel
to
it
all
medium

and
moderately
carbonated
this
is
easily
drinkable
refreshing
and
overall
very
good
drinkability
it
started
out
alright
but
slowly
became
a
chore
to
finish
i
suggest
having
a
friend
on
hand
to
split
the
bottle
with
good
drinkable
beer
wouldnt
want
a
six
pack
of
it
though
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
had
to
pace
myself
in
order
to
not
drink
it
in
five
minutes
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
amberorange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
offwhite
head
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
is
generally
sweet
slightly
fruity
and
spicy
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
an
initial
sweetness
that
lingers
throughout
the
taste
complemented
by
slight
bittering
hops
and
a
mild
spice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
foamy
carbonation
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
high
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
nothing
outstanding
but
definitely
worth
trying
12oz

poured
into
a

glass
pours
a
beautiful
reddish
copper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
faint
but
provides
a
sweet
fruity
malt
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
spices
the
taste
is
malt
with
some
citrus
and
a
very
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
unlike
a
lot
of
reviewers
i
was
actually
pleased
with
this
beer
and
found
it
quite
drinkable
its
not
a
huge
flavor
bomb
and
those
looking
for
a
great
belgian
beer
experience
would
undoubtebly
find
it
lacking
but
as
a
beer
to
accompany
an
unpretentious
lunch
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
orange
very
bland
orange
color
with
a
far
beyond
adequate
head
smell
is
reasonable
with
some
nice
fruity
esters
but
there
is
a
presence
of
cardboard
in
there
as
well
taste
follows
suit
initially
offering
a
nice
biscuity
malt
sweetness
not
dissimilar
to
another
colorado
fave
but
after
a
few
seconds
the
flat
cardboard
thing
kicks
in
finish
is
mild
citric
hops
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
you
can
bring
some
over
if
you
want
though
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
somewhat
tasty
probably
the
session
beer
from
avery
but
still
cant
believe
there
isnt
more
hops
in
here
avery
is
one
of
the
hop
kings
the
belgian
yeast
does
not
assert
itself
also
easy
to
drink
but
perhaps
youll
be
left
wanting
more
the
bottle
implies
that
the
hops
are
belgian
in
origin
but
theres
none
of
the
peppery
flavor
im
used
to
from
those
while
the
malts
are
basically
too
light
to
do
much
of
anything
with
the
overload
of
tannins
left
in
the
mouth
not
a
great
brew
overall
d
nothing
really
stands
out
other
than
the
nice
fruity
nose
i
could
session
this
without
any
problems
but
its
way
off
for
the
style
the
scent
of
this
ale
prepares
you
for
a
sweet
and
fruity
ale
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
that
is
accompanied
by
yeast
flavors
this
ale
has
a
nice
fruity
essence
to
it
the
body
is
well
done
with
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
holding
true
to
most
belgian
ales
the
end
of
this
brew
has
a
nice
spicy
but
sweet
taste
to
it
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
avery
brews
had
this
on
tap
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
asheville
this
afternoon
havent
seen
it
before
and
was
told
that
it
just
came
in
this
morning
and
i
was
getting
the
first
pull
awesome
poured
a
rich
amber
with
a
huge
white
sticky
head
deep
lacing
was
evident
from
the
start
nice
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
smell
was
intresting
somewhat
hoppy
but
more
of
a
spiced
belgian
twist
hints
of
bananas
were
very
noticeable
as
well
as
some
orange
peel
the
feel
was
unusually
smooth
and
a
bit
flat
at
first
i
actually
was
not
impressed
with
the
first
sip
but
rather
the
later
ones
were
much
better
felt
very
creamy
and
had
a
nice
lingering
finish
to
it
muted
american
hops
were
mixed
in
with
a
nice
plae
belgian
taste
again
bananas
and
pears
mixed
with
some
earthy
bready
grains
were
the
commonplace
overall
this
was
a
fairly
intresting
brew
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
and
was
defiantly
pleasantly
suprised
will
have
to
try
it
again
if
i
see
bottles
well
crafted
for
sure
when
my
buddy
and
i
sampled
this
beer
our
first
reaction
was
the
same
huh
not
sure
what
this
beer
wanted
to
be
or
where
it
wanted
to
go
a
bit
sweet
with
what
seemed
a
distinct
belgian
candy
sugar
note
and
a
toffee
malt
presence
perhaps
just
a
hint
of
yeasty
funk
but
it
may
have
been
my
imagination
not
really
a
pale
ale
not
really
belgian
just
lackluster
a
rare
letdown
from
avery
this
is
the
first
beer
from
avery
that
i
did
not
think
was
exceptional
not
sure
what
beer
style
they
are
going
for
with
this
one
but
did
not
test
very
belgian
like
not
terrible
but
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
avery
no
real
taste
and
not
recommended
d
this
is
a
descent
representation
of
the
style
not
the
best
but
it
was
pretty
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
reddishcopper
in
color
with
a
nice
billowy
head
a
lot
of
biscuit
and
grain
flavors
in
this
beer
which
is
joined
by
some
hop
flavor
and
mild
fruit
the
bitterness
curls
around
the
tongue
and
sits
on
it
after
each
sip
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
i
had
no
idea
was
intended
to
be
belgianstyled
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
not
a
standalone
it
would
go
well
with
a
spicy
meal
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
stocking
up
on
not
a
very
noteworthy
beer
tasty
and
drinkable
but
not
much
to
expound
on
d
pretty
good
beer
but
i
really
had
to
search
for
the
belgian
yeast
its
there
but
much
more
subtle
than
hoped
for
otherwise
a
pale
ale
thats
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
the
pack
good
for
a
try
then
probably
move
on
golden
body
with
a
bright
clear
orange
hue
solid
lace
and
head
white
in
color
smells
of
dank
unripenedfruit
esters
with
a
pepper
backing
clean
and
crisp
with
a
layer
of
caramel
taste
is
clean
and
reminiscent
of
a
welldone
amber
with
a
belgian
twang
wild
yeast
flavors
with
fruits
and
ripe
citric
tones
protruding
all
along
a
very
solid
malt
base
finishes
with
a
semidry
tang
very
solid
introductory
beer
not
exceptionally
belgianesque
if
thats
what
youre
expecting
it
is
however
a
wellmade
seemingly
belgianinspired
amber
ale
and
for
that
i
have
to
give
it
props
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
smallish
tan
foamy
head
the
color
is
nicebut
the
head
is
small
the
smell
is
very
pungent
with
sweet
malt
and
a
strong
bisquity
aroma
the
taste
is
crispsweet
and
very
drinkable
the
bisquity
aroma
is
also
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
sweet
malt
makes
this
a
tasty
beer
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
this
is
just
another
quality
beer
from
a
quality
brewery
cheers
pours
a
crisp
orange
with
a
frothy
offwhite
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
sweet
malts
citrus
hops
and
a
decent
belgian
yeast
bite
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
lighter
alternative
to
its
stronger
belgian
counterparts
drank
very
easy
sort
of
a
training
wheels
belgian
pa
not
my
favorite
avery
an
average
domestic
version
that
doesnt
do
too
much
for
me
too
floral
dry
and
bland
to
go
back
to
overall
an
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
and
a
decent
intro
to
the
style
for
a
novice
however
it
falls
flat
with
thin
flavors
and
not
enough
pizzaz
drinkability
not
a
bad
belgian
ale
worth
a
try
needs
a
touch
more
flavor
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
sticky
lacing
down
side
of
glass
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
some
spices
and
banana
in
the
background
taste
is
fruity
yeast
with
the
sweet
malts
as
the
backbone
a
little
too
cloying
for
me
with
the
sweetness
staying
in
the
mouth
average
drinkability
means
it
lasted
me
over
an
hour
a
rarity
after
decanting
this
beer
is
a
nice
brown
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
laces
nicely
the
nose
is
soft
with
suggestions
of
biscuits
honey
and
perhaps
some
peppery
spice
very
yeasty
as
well
the
tastes
starts
out
with
the
yeast
contributing
sweet
light
summer
fruit
flavors
with
a
bit
of
spicey
peppery
hoppiness
to
provide
some
balance
and
finishes
very
biscuity
with
caramel
malt
flavor
lingering
mouthfeel
is
good
some
tingly
carbonation
provides
activity
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
too
this
beer
isnt
very
challenging
which
is
nice
on
some
occasions
a
good
summer
seasonal
at
the
very
least
refreshingly
nectarlike
and
very
drinkable
light
and
inoffensive
fun
brew
wasnt
even
sure
what
i
ordered
since
ive
never
seen
karma
in
charlotte
before
and
the
menu
didnt
have
averys
name
attached
to
it
paid
3
50
for
a
bottle
thought
it
was
an
american
pale
ale
and
liked
the
belgian
flavoring
to
this
then
saw
how
it
should
be
a
belgium
pale
ale
and
felt
this
didnt
have
the
body
for
the
style
tasty
nonetheless
with
some
fruit
spice
and
a
nice
balance
of
hops
quite
refreshing
on
a
summer
evening
was
drawn
in
by
the
avery
label
and
the
tagline
good
beer
happens
to
good
people
if
thats
true
ive
been
fairly
mediocre
lately
as
my
beer
karma
can
attest
poured
a
coppery
amber
topped
with
two
inches
of
mountainous
foam
which
subsided
to
a
thin
lacy
head
which
left
a
bit
of
nice
looking
lace
on
the
glass
smelled
and
tasted
metallic
a
real
turn
off
a
bit
of
banana
in
the
nose
some
biscuitbread
in
the
mouth
but
a
really
subpar
effort
for
what
has
become
one
of
my
favority
brewing
companies
why
would
anyone
make
a
filtered
belgian
beautiful
color
but
lacks
the
haze
it
needs
to
be
a
little
more
real
good
beer
but
a
little
illustrious
it
needs
something
more
poured
from
a
bottle
obtained
at
lone
hill
liquors
in
glendora
inhaled
aroma
after
pour
to
find
a
very
very
faint
fruitinessmaltiness
not
much
like
a
normal
belgium
the
taste
was
the
same
maybe
some
apple
apricot
something
but
almost
not
enough
to
even
be
worth
figuring
out
i
get
light
malts
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
malty
bitter
really
very
boring
beer
i
wont
get
it
again
if
i
think
about
it
i
can
detect
the
apricot
barely
not
good
easy
without
hesitation
on
tap
this
comes
out
a
lovely
honeygolden
color
with
a
nice
head
aroma
has
fruity
hints
excellent
flavor
provides
undertones
of
fruitiness
and
is
hoppy
but
not
bitter
though
it
has
a
bit
of
a
nip
this
ale
is
very
smooth
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
looking
ale
maybe
from
cold
low
weak
head
with
no
lacing
to
speak
of
taste
was
hoppy
with
a
bitter
finish
that
was
just
blaa
to
me
there
was
nothing
that
really
set
this
beer
off
just
a
blaa
beer
i
thought
i
will
not
buy
again
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
is
it
up
to
the
standard
of
a
great
belgian
no
but
it
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
pours
a
light
copper
orange
color
with
a
thin
quarterinch
head
which
dissipates
quickly
no
lace
to
speak
of
light
aroma
of
fruity
esters
some
banana
some
very
faint
citrus
a
muted
malt
scent
as
well
the
taste
echos
the
aroma
some
fruitiness
here
with
some
malty
undertones
and
a
lightly
chewy
banana
cake
mix
finish
im
not
sure
how
old
this
beer
is
but
it
finishes
extremely
thin
and
flat
the
mouthfeel
holds
up
but
thats
about
all
this
one
has
going
for
it
i
am
completely
underwhelmed
by
this
avery
effort
the
brewery
wont
likely
be
remembered
for
this
brew
give
it
a
try
if
youre
really
curious
but
there
are
much
better
belgian
styles
out
there
to
try
a
decent
tasting
brew
i
enjoyed
it
but
doubt
if
i
would
buy
a
12er
for
a
sitting
this
beer
was
rather
drinkable
and
while
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
from
avery
i
did
enjoy
it
im
finding
it
to
be
a
little
lacking
compared
to
its
belgian
brothers
its
not
bad
its
just
not
the
wizz
pow
you
grow
accustomed
to
in
belgian
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
no
flaws
not
impressively
deep
but
a
great
mild
americanmade
belgian
with
all
the
requisite
elements
d
fine
a
decent
summer
beer
there
is
a
nice
level
of
complexity
a
good
beer
for
the
style
not
phenolic
enjoyable
d
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
but
i
think
i
wont
ever
purchase
this
one
again
sessionable
and
good
with
food
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
bronze
color
the
head
is
a
creamy
eggshell
color
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
with
plum
and
other
dark
fruits
but
no
noticable
yeast
character
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
nothing
special
i
do
not
think
i
will
buy
this
again
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
so
would
i
buy
a
whole
sixpack
of
it
probably
not
white
elephant
bif
strikes
again
not
a
very
impressive
beer
bland
at
every
corner
there
are
plenty
of
other
belgian
pale
ales
to
choose
from
to
settle
with
this
certaintly
not
a
bad
brewi
havent
sampled
anything
from
avery
that
i
would
not
gladly
imbibebut
this
one
seems
some
what
lightweight
and
lacking
in
character
a
bit
off
balance
not
one
of
the
best
from
avery
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
large
rocky
dense
head
aroma
is
mellow
with
hints
of
fruit
tasting
brings
out
hints
of
honey
spices
and
apricots
hops
are
very
subdued
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
and
avoids
being
cloying
lots
of
lacing
with
this
one
actually
a
pretty
tasty
brew
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
agree
with
most
other
bas
in
that
this
brew
though
very
nice
doesnt
reall
live
up
to
the
belgian
pale
ale
billing
sweet
rich
malty
and
clean
but
lacks
some
fundimental
belgian
qualities
it
lacks
the
tartness
pepperyness
and
light
belgian
astringency
the
body
sweetness
and
alcohol
seem
fine
the
malts
pilsner
seem
to
be
quite
caramelized
adding
a
strong
sweetness
that
would
dominate
any
present
belgian
character
quite
bready
and
lightly
toffylike
pears
and
peaches
share
characteristics
of
belgian
pale
ales
but
the
similarities
are
few
id
be
happy
to
take
any
of
these
brews
off
of
the
hands
of
disappointed
bas
though
more
like
a
amber
ale
to
me
pours
a
orangegoldenamber
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
head
which
dissappates
quickly
some
lacing
afterwards
scents
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
some
spices
the
taste
is
sweetmalty
slight
caramel
after
taste
some
honey
in
there
as
well
medium
body
drinkable
like
i
said
before
more
like
a
amber
ale
but
tasty
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
very
quaffable
just
not
that
interesting
not
a
chore
by
any
means
but
not
intriquing
enough
for
another
overall
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
me
on
this
one
nothing
great
but
nothing
really
off
putting
a
less
than
stellar
offering
from
avery
merely
a
check
mark
in
thei
drank
this
one
box
i
was
very
dissappointed
with
this
effort
from
avery
probably
my
least
favorite
brew
to
date
from
a
brewery
i
love
and
respect
the
head
poured
thick
and
cream
tan
lots
of
small
bubbles
but
the
aroma
was
very
flata
very
light
fruit
if
i
swirled
and
dug
in
deep
but
nothing
like
the
yeasty
fruity
easters
normally
in
a
belgain
ale
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
but
not
malt
to
back
it
up
and
there
was
an
astringint
taste
underneath
that
just
puckered
my
mouth
a
bit
not
much
hop
which
is
fine
but
theres
no
balance
in
whats
left
thought
maybe
the
bottle
was
old
but
didnt
really
taste
oxidizedseemed
like
the
beer
as
intended
oh
well
this
is
good
solid
beer
it
has
a
nice
amber
color
spicy
fruity
medicinal
banana
ester
aroma
a
good
tropical
and
spice
flavor
favoring
banana
with
a
yogurty
tang
nice
body
and
a
smooth
finish
very
drinkable
sessionable
for
sure
recommended
certainly
better
than
many
of
the
other
reviews
here
have
indicated
not
the
greatest
from
avery
nor
the
greatest
americanized
version
of
a
belgian
pale
a
drinkable
and
interesting
brew
with
spices
but
not
exactly
belgian
in
character
that
said
flavors
are
balanced
and
enjoyable
certainly
worth
a
try
d
good
flavor
not
overly
sweet
had
a
good
tartness
too
it
pretty
good
to
the
belgian
style
id
have
another
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
i
pick
up
apples
or
pears
also
upon
tasting
very
slightly
vinous
too
another
brewery
i
really
like
this
is
fairly
low
in
alchol
for
avery
but
it
is
nice
on
a
warm
late
summer
day
highy
recommended
d
im
not
sure
id
go
after
this
one
again
there
are
better
representations
of
this
style
out
there
worth
a
try
though
as
every
ones
different
great
beer
goes
down
easy
good
in
hot
weather
hazy
copper
color
with
generous
head
from
draught
tap
in
boulder
co
nose
has
a
slight
smoky
note
that
mixes
with
a
background
of
malt
and
hops
nothing
special
jumps
out
otherwise
very
balanced
beer
on
the
palate
with
inoffensive
finish
a
pleasing
daily
beer
with
few
flaws
but
few
features
to
write
home
about
worth
trying
d
its
easy
to
drink
but
its
pretty
nondescript
i
hate
to
repackage
what
others
have
written
but
its
true
ommegangs
rare
vos
remains
my
preferred
american
representative
of
this
style
hence
the
handle
karma
is
ok
but
id
never
really
crave
one
if
it
were
offered
to
me
id
drink
it
but
there
isnt
much
flavor
or
experimentation
here
i
finally
found
the
description
in
very
small
print
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
its
drinkable
and
goes
down
well
though
i
couldnt
help
but
think
the
reason
there
the
description
is
so
well
hidden
is
because
there
isnt
really
anything
distinctive
about
this
beer
is
it
good
sure
is
there
anything
special
about
this
beer
unfortunately
no
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
clear
body
that
leaves
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
caramel
roasted
nuts
cooked
sugar
hops
and
wheat
fresh
grass
the
taste
starts
tart
with
a
wheat
twang
that
is
followed
by
a
heavy
malty
caramel
background
that
evolves
to
a
slightly
toasted
nutty
feel
on
the
palate
and
finishes
again
tart
it
also
has
a
little
hop
bitterness
for
balance
but
just
enough
and
ends
a
little
boozey
within
that
malty
background
quality
brew
from
avery
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
with
some
maltyness
some
esters
and
some
other
spicyness
taste
is
fairly
good
some
nice
maltyness
breadyness
spicyness
and
some
hop
bitterness
mouth
is
a
litte
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
but
the
carbination
is
good
a
good
intro
beer
to
a
non
drinker
who
is
not
familar
with
the
belgian
pale
style
drinkability
easily
quaffed
on
a
hot
summer
night
yet
lacking
in
any
outstanding
characteristic
cheers2beers
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
suffering
from
its
classification
people
try
one
expecting
something
more
belgian
as
is
even
states
on
the
label
and
it
gets
a
bum
rap
on
this
site
i
think
karma
transcends
and
americanizes
styles
quite
well
this
is
more
like
a
malty
sort
of
spicy
mellow
ipa
yum
intense
applepear
ripe
fruit
sensation
mouthfeel
has
a
somewhat
drying
aspect
to
it
not
overly
complex
this
is
a
one
note
interpretation
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
not
averys
best
offering
very
thin
almost
like
a
belgian
light
beer
not
at
all
what
id
call
a
belgian
pale
ale
this
beer
has
some
karma
issues
it
needs
to
reconcile
drinkability
not
a
bad
glass
of
beer
just
not
enough
going
on
the
flavors
are
kind
of
subdued
overall
very
basic
middle
of
the
road
this
is
the
easiest
to
drink
avery
product
ive
had
since
living
in
boulder
i
live
in
ak
now
and
only
seem
to
get
their
large
beers
it
has
a
light
estery
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
tight
head
that
does
not
quit
and
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
it
has
moderate
carbonation
with
a
lightmedium
body
this
is
a
tasty
belgianesque
session
beer
bottom
line
theres
plenty
of
flavourful
avery
beers
out
there
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
dont
recommend
it
not
much
here
to
surprise
nor
enjoy
as
i
drank
through
this
one
the
more
and
more
disgusted
i
became
with
it
and
i
had
to
dump
the
last
few
ounces
down
the
sink
it
made
me
feel
sick
to
my
stomach
the
only
bad
beer
ive
had
from
avery
bc
da
very
nice
ale
i
would
have
this
again
drinkability
not
averys
best
offering
i
suppose
id
drink
this
again
but
there
are
others
of
the
same
style
domestics
included
of
course
that
are
more
worth
your
time
some
better
concentration
on
this
beer
could
make
it
pretty
great
but
for
now
its
fairly
average
a
bit
thin
but
averall
a
nice
light
drinkable
beer
karma
is
a
clear
pale
amber
with
mild
carbonation
the
offwhite
head
is
small
and
creamy
retention
is
weak
aroma
is
yeasty
spicy
with
an
underlying
sweetness
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
slightly
nutty
with
just
a
bit
of
sugary
sweetness
yeasty
flavors
hang
on
the
edge
of
a
sip
and
have
a
zesty
fruitiness
light
hop
flavors
are
noted
as
is
a
touch
of
bitterness
finish
is
longlasting
and
of
sweet
malt
the
overall
taste
is
just
a
bit
too
thin
for
a
higher
score
however
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
one
i
can
hang
with
all
night
to
me
this
is
the
belgian
version
of
session
ale
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
while
its
definitely
an
americanization
of
the
style
its
got
some
nice
things
going
for
it
amazing
no
good
yes
a
very
drinkable
beer
something
thatd
be
great
to
always
have
in
the
fridge
clear
copper
small
beige
head
spotty
lace
aroma
is
earthy
and
robust
elemental
but
theres
also
a
whiff
of
a
perfumelike
hop
presence
interesting
and
good
medium
full
body
lightly
carbonated
flavor
is
unique
and
good
almost
an
american
kind
of
hop
presence
though
i
dont
know
if
american
hops
were
used
they
impart
a
slight
mintiness
and
fragrance
malts
underneath
are
sweet
and
biscuity
good
foundation
and
good
overall
balance
of
flavors
good
beer
perhaps
a
bad
beer
and
maybe
oxidized
but
it
had
just
arrived
at
my
store
so
should
have
been
fresh
unless
the
distributor
passed
off
something
taking
from
somewhere
else
unfortunately
avery
doesnt
date
stamp
their
bottles
for
me
to
tell
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
finger
or
so
of
khaki
foam
nose
has
some
buttery
diacetyl
caramel
malt
and
fruit
taste
mirrors
the
nose
fruity
malt
with
a
diacetyl
twang
wheres
the
yeast
where
are
those
esters
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
this
isnt
much
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
sure
what
it
is
not
that
bad
but
not
to
style
and
not
very
focused
either
insert
karma
joke
here
this
is
not
a
beer
to
sit
and
savor
and
study
and
muse
about
instead
this
is
a
tasty
session
style
brew
i
could
easily
bang
down
six
of
these
in
a
few
hours
in
a
variety
of
settings
i
did
not
expect
to
like
this
one
this
much
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
darkish
yellow
orange
appearance
almost
amber
clearish
with
a
14
inch
white
head
of
foam
laces
amply
but
fairly
simply
on
the
glass
bready
aroma
some
pizza
dough
yeastiness
with
hop
tones
but
fairly
reserved
overall
light
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
high
effervesence
light
in
the
flavor
department
mildly
hoppy
in
almost
a
pac
northwest
sense
standard
malt
bill
and
not
much
else
other
than
a
bit
of
cinnamon
spiciness
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
qualities
more
typical
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
missing
but
the
aroma
is
pleasant
and
comes
off
pretty
well
jack
of
all
trades
master
of
none
comes
to
mind
this
brew
is
just
trying
to
do
too
much
its
definitely
not
a
farmhouse
ale
not
a
standard
apa
not
an
ipa
id
call
it
experimental
drinkable
but
odd
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
actively
carbonated
while
the
flavor
doesnt
exactly
live
up
to
the
bountiful
aromas
this
is
still
a
respectable
ale
considering
its
light
body
and
relatively
low
abv
it
packs
quite
a
flavor
punch
a
nice
addition
to
the
summer
lineup
of
lawnmower
ales
clear
amber
in
color
aromatics
of
yeast
and
its
attributes
malt
toast
biscuit
fruit
along
with
a
touch
of
herbaceous
and
floral
hops
the
combination
inevitably
leads
to
an
antibiotically
and
medicinally
rich
nose
which
i
find
very
unpleasant
the
aromatics
pretty
much
continue
on
upon
tasting
boring
and
dull
definately
not
as
yeasty
as
i
was
hoping
for
light
in
body
watery
texture
i
dont
care
if
they
used
rochefort
yeast
or
not
i
go
by
what
is
in
the
glass
and
this
is
much
more
a
british
bitter
than
a
belgian
ale
fruity
and
estery
cmon
lets
get
serious
here
ill
look
forward
to
picking
up
sixers
of
this
all
summer
long
mellow
is
the
one
word
that
sums
up
this
beer
very
mild
and
easy
on
the
senses
this
is
a
beer
that
just
doesnt
challenge
or
offend
anyone
a
good
beer
for
any
normal
type
of
food
without
a
strong
flavor
or
spiciness
an
excellent
beer
for
a
simple
lunch
of
bread
and
mild
cheese
and
a
bowl
of
chicken
and
rice
soup
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
disapated
quickly
but
left
some
good
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
beer
had
a
hoppy
aroma
with
some
biscuit
and
slight
fruit
but
nothing
to
powerful
to
my
nose
the
taste
a
bit
hoppy
with
some
orange
fruit
tones
but
nothing
to
strong
or
overly
enjoyable
nice
gold
color
beer
with
a
heathy
white
head
smell
of
light
malt
even
a
little
wheaty
yeasty
for
sure
and
some
must
citrus
too
taste
is
clean
malt
with
fruit
tones
and
a
slight
sweetness
finished
by
a
little
citrus
thin
in
the
mouth
but
still
drinkable
not
what
i
would
call
to
style
but
not
too
bad
either

twofinger

a
12oz

westborough
ma
too
many
tannins
for
me
and
not
enough
sweetness
malt
profile
to
balance
things
out
if
this
is
karma
when
do
i
get
the
balance
this
beer
pours
with
a
slightly
hazed
tea
color
with
a
massive
cream
colored
dense
head
that
is
characteristic
of
a
belgian
style
beer
the
smell
consists
of
a
nice
fruit
and
spice
aroma
with
slight
musty
yeast
notes
in
the
background
quite
nice
so
far
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
after
the
smell
builds
the
expectations
it
has
a
mild
seltzer
taste
with
very
faint
fruit
perhaps
raisins
far
in
the
background
followed
by
a
light
dry
bitterness
bringing
back
the
seltzer
fizz
what
a
let
down
where
does
something
that
smells
so
nice
hide
the
taste
this
medium
bodied
beer
finishes
just
slightly
dry
good
start
to
this
experience
and
then
the
rug
was
yanked
out
from
under
me
cheers
anyways
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
brew
the
pour
is
second
to
none
but
from
there
it
loses
its
steam
not
to
impressed
with
the
taste
here
not
picking
up
much
of
the
smells
i
detected
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
though
clean
and
smoothe
but
not
much
here
ill
be
frank
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
flavorful
this
strikes
me
more
as
a
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
thrown
in
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
also
not
great
fairly
highly
carbonated
on
the
other
hand
it
is
somewhat
light
and
refreshing
ill
have
to
give
a
retest
when
it
is
not
snowing
outside

colored
foam
aroma
of
sweet
fruity
malts
sweet
spicy
vanilla
and
ripe
apricots
detected

overall
sweet
and
attractive
aroma
the
taste
is
fine
with
semisweet
fruit
malts
and
earthy
hop
undertones
solid
medium
body
and
overall
this
beer
gives
the
palate
gentle
swabs
of
pleasing
flavors
pleasant
and
very
much
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
dirty
orange
color
ale
with
a
huge
white
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
is
clearly
evident
as
well
as
a
mix
of
spices
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
belgian
signature
yeast
with
a
nice
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
good
take
on
the
style
without
being
remarkable
pours
out
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
tall
foamy
tan
head
the
head
dies
off
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lace
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
cloyingly
sweet
with
pretty
much
any
other
scent
that
might
come
out
hidden
as
it
warms
there
was
a
bit
of
spice
trying
to
get
out
pretty
much
unsuccessfully
taste
seems
to
have
the
same
fault
of
too
much
sweetness
fruits
and
sugars
are
about
all
and
too
much
of
them
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
funky
taste
to
it
but
that
is
eventually
drowned
out
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
drinkability
is
killed
by
that
cloying
nature
of
this
beer
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
here
but
i
hope
this
wasnt
it
12oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
quite
a
bit
of
head
to
it
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
ok
with
notes
of
some
floral
spices
and
sweetness
slightly
fruity
and
a
hair
bready
the
taste
is
decent
enough
but
unremarkable
slightly
bready
dry
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
pours
a
rich
deep
copper
tone
and
makes
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
smells
bready
light
flowery
and
earthy
hops
fruity
esters
light
bitterness
sweet
chewy
malt
flavor
actually
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
an
american
pale
ale
that
i
have
had
before
medium
on
the
palate
and
finishes
slightly
sticky
to
compare
this
to
other
belgian
pales
it
falls
quite
short
it
is
not
dry
crisp
or
peppery
on
the
palate
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
just
think
it
is
categorized
incorrectly
by
the
brewer
karma
tastes
like
a
balanced
caramel
malty
apa
brewed
with
a
less
than
delicious
thirdtier
hop
as
a
belgian
knockoff
its
a
failure
as
a
decent
drinkable
beer
its
a
success
12

chalkiness
taste
has
notes
of
spicy

hints
of

coriander
and
some
apricot
fruitiness
there
is
an
earthy
yeast
character
that
is
chalky
at
times
spicy
hops
bitterness
is
pervasive
an
interesting
offering
from
avery
very
average
when
compared
with
most
belgian
brewed
examples
of
the
style
very
enjoyable
it
is
somewhat
light
in
body
and
texture
though
this
could
prove
to
be
a
great
session
beer
lack
of
mouthfeel
could
be
a
freshness
issue
as
it
falls
somewhat
flat
after
a
full
glass
bottle
erupted
upon
opening
i
gotta
remember
to
let
these
sit
for
a
minute
before
opening
appearance
is
a
hazy
orangey
brown
with
a
little
ring
of
foam
smell
is
really
good
very
sweet
and
carmelly
with
some
spices
in
there
also
a
strong
nutty
smell
and
a
little
toffee
unfortunately
it
goes
downhill
from
there
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
the
taste
is
very
blandly
sweet
with
some
vague
sourness
throughout
even
a
veggie
taste
at
times
the
aftertaste
isnt
bad
though
as
the
toffee
makes
a
reappearance
overall
this
is
a
very
weird
beer
the
flavors
definitely
dont
blend
well
together
and
it
really
lacks
focus
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
taste
was
orange
belgian
yeast
spices
and
mild
caramel
malt
flavor
an
easy
drinking
belgian
style
ale
though
quite
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
the
flavors
and
aroma
were
more
subdued
than
i
had
anticipated
it
was
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
though
pours
a
dark
coppery
brown
with
a
finger
of
fizzy
offwhite
head
light
hoppy
floral
nose
with
a
bit
of
spices
and
a
faint
fruity
note
taste
is
a
light
yeast
malt
with
a
slightly
nutty
note
and
a
nice
grassy
hop
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
dryness
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
tastes
like
a
good
american
pale
wheat
ale
certainly
not
was
i
was
expecting
from
a
belgian
pale
pint
at
42nd
street
oyster
bar
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
14
light
beige
head
over
the
copper
brew
frothy
foam
head
lasts
well
with
provides
nice
plentiful
lacing
aroma
is
somewhat
nondescript
nothing
notable
taste
kind
of
disappointingly
follows
the
nose
with
light
malt
sweetness
to
start
the
faintest
glimmer
of
spicing
and
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
for
a
generic
beer
but
lacking
for
the
style
i
expected
so
much
more
not
bad
not
bad
busily
going
through
a
major
sampler
of
beers
from
all
over
i
came
to
karma
from
avery
brewing
co
the
color
when
poured
was
a
goldenorange
mix
and
the
bitter
bite
left
me
searching
for
more
the
head
small
and
the
finish
a
little
tart
with
some
flower
characteristics
showing
through
the
whole
experience
still
it
is
a
decent
brew
and
i
am
intigued
now
to
try
other
ones
from
this
brewery
poured
a
dark
copper
into
the
glass
with
a
good
head
that
disipated
into
a
thin
covering
aroma
is
sweet
and
slightly
earthy
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
bit
grassy
but
finished
slightly
sour
its
an
okay
beer
with
a
unique
flavour
probably
not
one
that
i
will
buy
more
of
but
ill
certainly
finish
what
i
have
of
it
aroma
was
nutty
with
biscuit
and
fruity
esters
and
taste
was
toasted
caramel
malt
with
a
little
grass
from
the
understated
sterling
hops
i
was
prepared
for
a
much
more
traditional
belgian
ale
avery
claims
this
to
be
part
farmhouse
ale
part
pale
ale
i
think
it
is
a
pale
ale
with
mild
belgium
yeast
and
very
understated
belgium
flavors
coriander
and
citrusorange
zest
oil
finish
is
semisweet
with
caramel
malt
easy
drinking
at
5
2
abv
it
is
certainly
a
candidate
for
a
session
beer
drinkable
sure
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
next
time
they
brew
a
style
of
beer
they
should
make
sure
it
represents
the
style
however
thats
just
my
opinion
probably
worth
a
try
however
flavor
is
mild
with
some
sweet
toffee
up
front
and
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
coming
through
later
the
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
overall
the
flavor
is
mild
and
a
little
boring
not
much
of
a
belgian
style
pale
imo
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
am
glad
i
dont
ahve
a
whole
case
of
this
one
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fine
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
along
with
a
pepperycoriander
aroma
its
dry
with
some
light
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
weak
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
mustiness
it
is
slightly
fruity
with
a
lemony
zest
and
a
bit
of
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
not
much
for
a
belgian
style
it
drinks
well
but
its
not
one
to
seek
out
again
bottle
obtained
from
the
brewery
and
consumed
a
couple
days
later
pours

are

also
have
a
gentle
grapefruity
pith
and

oil
taste
is
caramel
apricot
mildly
hop
citrus
flavor
and
bitter
grapefruit
pith
goodness
this
is
a
light
and
refreshing
summer
beer
thats
totally
drinkable
it
tastes
like
a
candy
ive
had
dippin
sticks
plus
some
oily
orange
hop
mixing
with
fruity
esters
esters
are
apricot
i
mentioned
this
before
blackberry
strawberry
a
touch
of
dried
hay
and
honey
belgian
funk
is
at
a
minimum
and
there
is
a
hint
of
toasted
grains
light
body
but
the
sugars
flow
thicker
than
the
beer
weighs
md
carbonation
which
works
well
with
the
flavors
this
was
a
really
tasty
beer
bordering
on
complex
well
done
overall
an
okay
brew
not
something
id
go
for
a
lot
though
karma
ale
seemed
like
it
couldnt
make
up
its
mind
to
be
a
pale
ale
or
a
quasiwitbier
worth
trying
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
visitor
to
my
dbf
d
reminds
me
of
de
koninck
in
a
way
with
that
said
it
is
very
drinkable
nicely
hopped
but
somewhat
off
funky
tasting

there
is
fruitiness
there

something

as
much

present
on
the
tongue
as
the
nose
would
suggest
the
hop

medium
slightly
cloudy

color
with

mostly
of
malt
with
a

background
taste
is

of

with
is
overpowered
by
the
caramel
maltiness
leaves
a
pleasant
dry
finish
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
definitely
trt
again
i
must
admit
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
this
is
a
great
summertime
quaffer
it
seems
to
be
a
sessionable
belgian
ale
i
like
it
i
am
very
glad
i
procured
a
sixpack
of
this
i
was
only
going
to
buy
a
single
but
sixers
were
on
sale
i
purchased
it
in
boulder
co
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
enough
try
at
the
style
that
doesnt
quite
make
it
will
not
be
buying
more
of
these
but
also
will
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
sixer
vigorous
pour
produced
a
fairly
thick
creamy
looking
head
that
faded
slowly
leaving
a
solid
coat
of
lace
slightly
hazy
amber
colored
beer
with
no
signs
of
carbonation
within
notes
of
butterscotch
and
apricot
in
the
aroma
body
is
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
watery
and
crisp
beer
is
mildly
sweet
and
quite
refreshing
with
its
lightly
fruity
flavors
there
might
be
some
floral
hops
in
there
but
other
then
that
there
isnt
a
whole
going
on
according
to
the
label
its
supposed
to
be
somewhere
between
a
farmhouse
ale
and
a
belgain
pale
ale
its
got
the
fruitiness
of
the
pale
ale
and
thats
about
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
a
good
amount
of
fruity
flavor
without
and
malt
or
hops
to
balance
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
choose
it
over
other
belgian
pales
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
not
the
usual
hopaccentuated
beers
that
we
all
love
from
avery
brewing
but
this
one
is
flavorful
on
its
own
merit
it
represents
the
spirit
of
the
style
well
in
that
it
is
a
belgian
session
beer
this
is
one
you
can
drink
all
night
long
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
are
turned
off
by
the
typical
estery
belgian
beers
moderate
mouth
works
well
with
the
active
carbonation
but
its
still
a
little
rough
very
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
for
the
style
beer
is
good
happy
beering
avery
has
delivered
a
very
nice
somewhat
complex
and
enjoyable

phenolic
american
take
on
belgian
pale
avery
allways
seems
to
make
their
brews
a
little
differant
and
this
one
does
not
break
the
mold
kinda
of
an
interesting
beer
i
will
admit
i
bought
it
because
it
was
a
cool
bottle
anyways
the
appearance
is
very
nice
with
a
copper
body
and
white
head
this
definately
looks
like
a
belgian
pale
the
aroma
was
a
little
weak
the
was
a
peppery
malt
and
fruit
smell
the
taste
is
what
threw
me
off
it
was
not
bad
tasting
but
didnt
really
taste
like
a
belgian
pale
it
was
very
much
like
a
belgian
wit
with
all
the
spices
and
fruit
kicking
in
overall
it
was
enjoyable
just
a
confusing
brew
poured
a
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
aroma
is
nondescript
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
karma
starts
off
malty
and
then
shifts
to
a
fruity
flavor
spicy
yeast
emerges
and
add
a
nice
flavor
to
the
mix
finishes
pretty
clean
leaving
you
to
want
for
more
karma
is
very
easy
drinking
yet
nothing
stands
out
about
this
beer
that
makes
you
say
that
its
really
spectacular
either
id
give
karma
another
shot
but
with
so
many
options
out
there
its
probably
something
that
id
keep
passing
over
for
other
brews
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
copper
colored
with
a
huge
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
hoppy
this
beer
does
not
really
smell
like
a
belgian
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
grainy
maltiness
there
is
just
a
little
caramel
and
fruit
flavor
the
finish
is
weak
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
none
of
the
flavors
are
appealing
enough
to
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
beer
lacks
focus
and
was
a
disappointment
drinkability
maybe
on
a
hot
day
ill
let
you
know
after
some
yard
work
but
average
at
best
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slick
creaminess
that
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
one
was
interesting
enough
but
this
just
doesnt
grab
me
enough
to
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
slick
mouthfeel
really
nothing
special
going
on
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightly
syrupy
malty
and
bitter
finish
i
found
one
bottle
to
be
enough
in
the
session
so
drinkability
was
marked
below
good
but
definitely
above
average
this
is
not
one
of
my
top
picks
with
avery
using
belgian
material
doesnt
make
you
belgian
none
the
less
this
is
tasty
if
not
very
american
tasting
aside
from
the
yeast
profile
this
is
light
enough
to
drink
anytime
the
belgian
funk
almost
comes
out
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
it
doesnt
seem
brought
to
the
fore
regardless
this
is
a
tasty
beer
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
probably
not
worth
your
while
walking
the
earth
for
it
though
grasshopper
pours
a
goldencopper
hue
with
a
flourish
of
a
halfinch
creamy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
aroma
of
crisp
clean
ale
yeast
mellow
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
and
some
astringency
interesting
palate
of
light
sweet
malt
slightly
spicy
floral
hops
and
a
whole
lot
of
astringency
body
is
altogether
too
thin
and
watery
for
the
depth
of
flavor
here
a
real
letdown
actually
that
aside
a
pretty
refreshing
ale
for
the
summer
months
very
drinkable
a
good
introduction
into
the
style
nothing
here
to
overwhelm
but
enough
to
talk
about
i
like
it
avery
does
it
again
try
some
overall
nice

bitterness
medium

moderate

carbonation
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
maybe
a
bit
tame
but
still
rather
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
full
copper
color
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
pale
tan
head
that
starts
out
at
a
thickness
of
two
fingers
this
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
yet
the
head
does
have
some
staying
power
the
aroma
is
mildly
spicy
with
notes
of
lemon
basil
and
orange
the
citrusy
orange
notes
definitely
are
the
strongest
note
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
again
the
orange
citrus
note
carries
through
to
the
taste
as
well
this
beer
is
light
both
in
body
and
on
the
palate
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
yeasty
complexity
here
but
this
is
certainly
an
easily
quaffable
beer
that
is
appropriate
for
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
i
enjoy
most
of
averys
brews
this
ale
pours
deep
gold
with
a
twofinger
head
that
has
excellent
retention
it
doesnt
hit
the
mark
of
its
purported
style
as
a
belgian
pale
but
its
still
decent
the
aroma
is
quite
fruity
plums
dates
hint
of
peach
with
some
pleasant
nutty

overtones
this
ale
was
served
to
me
at
about
50
degrees
f
and
warmed
quickly
enhancing
the
aroma
and
taste
taste
is
a
bit
nutty
with
some
belgian
malt
flavorings
and
more
dark
fruit
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
baking
french
bread
mouthfeel
is
phenolically
oily
and
smooth
with
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
ale
but
definitely
not
a
belgian
pale

even
a

a
light
amber
color
with
a
tall
head
and
great
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
has
a
little
spicing
in
it
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
theres
nothing
too
interesting
here
good
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
beer
pours
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
finger
over
top
the
nose
is
interesting
i
get
some
bubblegum
or
cotton
candy
candied
sugar
and
some
spicyness
the
flavor
is
slightly
caramel
and
candy
sweet
with
a
slight
grainey
background
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
im
really
not
taken
by
this
beer
the
flavor
just
isnt
something
that
will
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
drinkability
average
overall
a
fantastic
looking
and
smelling
ale
i
cant
remember
a
beer
with
so
much
to
offer
in
the
color
and
scent
and
then
practically
bottomingout
when
it
hits
your
tongue
the
flavor
is
there
and
gone
in

the

was
a

had
a
sweetish
smell
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
based
on
the
smell
i
was
expected
an
average
to
good
beer
and
was
not
disappointed
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
but
not
something
that
id
search
for
another
good
offering
from
avery
but
not
the
home
run
like
white
rascal
if
this
is
supposed
to
mimic
a
farmhouse
ale
they
missed
it
by
a
long
way
ive
really
been
into
saisons
lately
and
this
bears
no
resemblance
if
it
were
an
american
amber
or
pale
ale
it
would
be
decent
but
still
not
worth
buying
with
much
better
examples
readily
available
ive
enjoyed
every
avery
beer
ive
had
thus
far
and
this
wasnt
bad
it
just
doesnt
come
close
to
what
its
meant
to
be
skip
this
and
get
the
maharaja
or
czar
kudos
avery
theres
not
much
particularly
belgian
about
this
beer
but
it
is
tasty
without
reading
the
label
to
find
the
style
aimed
for
i
would
have
guessed
it
to
be
a
simple
but
welldone
american
amber
its
quite
drinkable
regardless
comments
when
you
feel
like
backing
off
from
averys
big
beers
give
this
one
a
try
recommended
the
immigrates
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
crystal
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
portly
semicreamy
head
that
is
light
tan
in
color
nose
has
nice
malt
sweetness
fruity
with
hints
of
caramel
and
hay
fresh
and
clean
with
the
start
slightly
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
pleasant
top
is
middling
in
feel
finish
is
moderately
carbonated
and
the
hop
delectable
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
aftertaste
that
lingers
long
on
the
palate
a
nice
drinking
beer
and
one
i
could
enjoy
often
an
interesting
find
today
at
pipe
and
pintpoures
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
onefinger
tight
head
that
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lace
behindbig
caramel
and
biscuit
aromas
with
atouch
of
fruit
seems
to
be
malt
dominated
at
least
aroma
wise
big
malts
dominate
in
flavor
as
well
up
front
some
caramel
and
toffee
but
with
a
more
firm
dry
biscuit
backbone
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
sweetsome
herbal
hop
comes
thru
late
alot
more
as
it
warms
not
a
bad
little
beer
here
drink
it
cool
not
cold
alot
more
complexities
show
thru
as
it
warms
this
will
be
my
beer
for
the
summer
great
drinkability
and
great
flavor
very
smooth
yet
still
has
a
hoppiness
to
it
i
would
consider
it
closer
to
an
amber
rather
than
a
pale
delicious
scent
as
well
the
color
is
a
light
amber
it
is
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
and
is
not
for
everyone
but
i
loved
it
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
a
beautiful
beer
the
aroma
is
very
subtle
with
a
bready
malt
smell
and
a
fruity
yeast
smell
undoubtedly
what
they
were
going
for
in
a
belgian
pale
the
taste
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
this
beer
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
boston
ale
and
yet
they
call
it
a
belgian
pale
the
taste
is
a
biscuity
malt
with
a
light
floral
hops
flavor
and
a
fruity
yeast
taste
thats
not
really
spicy
or
distinct
enough
to
call
it
a
belgian
pale
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
i
do
think
this
is
slightly
overcarbonated
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
but
frankly
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
heh
an
easy
way
to
earn
karma
overall
it
was
decent
but
i
was
a
little
let
down
reminded
me
some
of
new
belgiums
trippel
but
not
as
good
tastes
of
clarified
pineapple
juice
its
like
biting
into
a
wonderfully
crisp
apple
theres
grapefruit
juice
in
the
aftertaste
and
some
of
that
white
pith
left
on
the
orange
when
youre
done
peeling
it
a
touch
of
caramel
a
hint
of
chocolate
mint
and
pineapple
sage
quite
chewy
leaves
raw
whole
grain
flour
on
the
palate
i
found
it
really
enjoyable
overall
impression
this
is
an
interesting
addition
to
averys
line
up
enjoyable
brew
as
the
days
get
warmer
nice
ale
with
a
smooth
finish
bland
typical
processed
beer
only
drink
if
you
have
little
choice
this
beer
is
only
okay
this
is
a
beer
that
isnt
exactly
going
to
wow
anyone
but
it
really
isnt
all
that
bad
and
would
be
a
good
craft
beer
to
have
on
hand
if
youre
expecting
company
and
want
to
offer
something
a
little
bit
different
than
your
standard
big
american
3
the
verdict
its
ok
drinkable
inoffensive
but
rather
bland
if
i
have
to
order
an
orange
flavored
macrobrew
shock
top
is
still
my
first
choice
i
suppose
this
would
do
in
a
pinch
brown
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
white
foam
covers
most
of
the
top
of
the
beer
light
brussels
lacing
faint
aroma
of
light
malt
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
gentle
spicy
and
somewhat
earthy
light
malt
body
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
interesting
pale
ale
but
i
prefer
others
over
this
overall
besides
the
slightly
toasted
malt
taste
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
flavor
its
slightly
hoppy
with
a
harsh
finish
o
just
a
soso
pale
ale
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
beerbut
it
was
just
commercial
garbage
like
millers
or
coors
this
is
a
coors
product
but
i
sure
think
that
its
a
step
in
the
right
direction
it
was
kind
of
a
stepping
stone
for
me
although
a
few
other
beers
were
too
namely
leinenkugels
and
shocktop
i
like
this
beer
its
light
its
perfect
for
drinking
when
the
weather
is
warmer
it
has
a
nice
taste
that
is
refreshing
i
love
the
citrus
taste
and
the
spice
after
taste
its
the
perfect
after
work
beer
its
what
i
buy
for
parties
now
and
it
is
the
beer
to
get
when
you
end
up
in
a
place
that
doesnt
serve
micros
it
has
a
light
head
which
is
nice
when
you
are
looking
for
something
refreshing
its
my
everyday
beer
now
and
i
really
like
it
but
it
in
no
way
has
kept
me
from
learning
more
about
and
trying
other
types
of
beer

what
a
rough
punch
this
beer
packs
or
what
do
you
call
a
flavor
that
hijacks
the
entire
beer
drinking
experience
not
really
a
belgian
and
less
so
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
strange
beer
that
will
baffle
you
so
try
it
if
you
are
a
die
hardor
else
pass
needless
to
say
i
am
a
little
bias
when
rating
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
beer
flavor
and
all
i
must
say
however
i
do
not
enjoy
it
in
the
bottle
i
prefer
this
beer
on
draft
a
crisp
orange
to
top
it
off
makes
this
beer
delicious
it
is
a
very
common
beer
that
most
enjoy
have
to
drink
it
on
tap
and
with
an
orange
very
full
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
if
you
want
to
step
up
from
the
run
of
the
mill
light
beers
to
dip
your
toe
into
a
more
flavorful
beer
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
do
it
with
there
is
not
much
risk
involved
with
trying
this
beer
there
is
a
slight
heaviness
that
comes
along
with
enjoying
this
beer
tastes
of
tea
and
sweet
raisin
emerge
from
a
weak
body
bits
of
malt
and
candied
sugary
sweetness
can
be
found
which
makes
me
wonder
if
the
brewers
had
the
budget
i
think
they
could
achieve
a
very
tasty
brew
this
beer
screams
inexpensive
for
mass
appeal
but
i
think
it
could
be
so
much
more
it
would
need
a
nice
yeasty
kick
a
better
grain
built
in
the
back
and
a
some
bitterness
to
be
a
real
belgian
style
pale
pours
a
deep
copper
with
almost
ruby
red
cast
moderate
bubbles
rising
and
a
dense
ecru
cap
aroma
is
first
a
light
dose
of
citrusy
herbal
green
hops
and
then
toasted
hawaiian
bread
and
some
extra
candy
sugar
sweetness
mostly
lightly
toasted
malt
in
the
taste
a
bit
woody
and
flat
just
a
bit
of
herbalgrassy
hops
and
just
a
bit
of
metallic
twang
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
but
fairly
juicy
initially
then
drying
not
really
alot
going
on
here
pale
ale
not
really
belgian
dont
taste
anything
belgian
more
of
a
generic
amber
ale
its
smells
funky
and
tastes
even
worse
if
a
cow
chewed
on
wheat
and
you
took
the
drool
from
its
big
ol
cow
lips
and
bottled
it
you
would
have
this
beer
it
tastes
stale
and
repugnant
at
the
same
time
go
ahead
stick
an
orange
in
it
it
wont
help
i
have
avoided
this
because
its
from
coors
however
limited
choices
at
my
local
grocer
prompted
me
to
finally
give
it
a
try
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
balanced
flavors
and
body
this
is
one
of
the
big
boys
most
notable
attempts
at
craft
type
brewing
ie
flavor
and
i
applaud
their
effort
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
sessionable
hard
to
hate
easy
to
overlook
but
as
said
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
i
would
give
it
a
3
255
i
found
it
in
a
bewers
winter
sample
kit
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
seasonal
one
i
hate
to
give
such
a
generic
review
but
i
bought
this
variety
pack
of
blue
moon
beers
that
included
valencia
grove
amber
belgian
style
pale
ale
sunshine
citrus
blonde
and
belgian
white
and
sad
to
say
the
only
one
that
tasted
okay
was
the
belgian
white
the
other
three
beers
tasted
like
they
were
the
same
beers
put
in
different
labeled
bottles
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
either
this
is
a
solid
simple
pale
ale
refreshing
on
its
own
but
the
crisp
bitterness
would
be
perfect
with
fish
and
chips
the
sharp
tang
complimenting
tarter
sauce
and
vinegar
cheers
i
would
have
guessed
that
this
was
an
easy
going
amber
ale
reminds
me
of
that
in
between
sort
of
beer
that
isnt
really
craft
but
is
definitely
better
than
piss
lager
michelob
amber
bock
killians
irish
red
petes
wicked
ale
and
the
like
this
might
be
one
notch
above
its
macrobrewed
bretheren
but
its
still
pretty
plain
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgians
but
this
is
decent
overall
honestly
this
beer
is
delicious
but
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
i
think
the
strong
caramel
flavor
masks
the
pale
ale
characteristics
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
it
is
similar
to
a
brown
ale
o
slightly
above
average
best
suited
for
transitional
towards
craft
beers
beer
drinkers
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
probably
a
good
beer
for
those
who
grew
up
on
american
macros
and
are
afraid
of
making
the
jump
to
craftimport
beers
o
a
decent
brew
great
for
the
holidays
but
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
every
night
id
recommend
it
to
a
friend
if
try
hadnt
had
it
before
overall
this
not
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
from
a
pale
ale
doesnt
take
like
anything
belgian
that
i
have
had
before
either
still
very
drinkable
thought
overall
pretty
decent
attempt
to
keep
the
bm
characteristic
all
while
having
something
hopheads
could
actually
enjoy
solid
beer
that
makes
getting
the
winter
sampler
worth
getting
o
this
beer
is
somewhat
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
much
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
is
slightly
out
of
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
almost
like
there
is
a
slight
lack
of
hops
moderate
amounts
of
complexity
o
smell
was
hiding
a
little
bit
in
this
brew
flavor
seemed
to
be
a
little
syrupy
at
times
too
sweet
but
the
hops
were
pleasant
way
to
low
of
carbonation
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
really
fruity
not
terribly
surprising
but
a
little
for
the
type
of
beer
tastes
of
barley
grain
and
some
earthy
hops
beer
is
a
little
bit
overcarbonated
but
goes
down
great
for
its
light
body
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
o
overall
an
ok
beer
would
drink
it
again
overall
overall
an
unimpressive
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
nothing
awful
just
nothing
exceedingly
memorable
drinkable
yes
with
enough
sweetness
to
use
in
the
proverbial
marinade
for
chicken
or
pork
would
work
as
an
entry
level
beer
for
belgian
newbies
looking
to
get
their
feet
wet
with
a
non
intimidating
new
kinda
beer
overall
id
accept
the
drink
if
offered
to
or
bought
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
search
this
one
out
to
buy
it
i
mean
its
still
beer
and
ill
be
sure
to
not
waste
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
o
i
agree
with
another
review
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
belgian
and
it
seemed
a
tad
too
malty
for
a
pale
ale
theres
several
blue
moons
i
prefer
to
this
o
honestly
this
has
no
qualities
that
resemble
a
belgian
pale
its
almost
as
if
coors
tried
and
failed
to
mimic
the
taste
without
using
any
belgian
yeasts
strains
as
a
beer
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
i
kinda
enjoyed
it
as
a
belgian
terrible
o
would
definitely
drink
some
more
and
plan
on
it
soon
the
5
4
is
a
great
bonus
too
very
enjoyable
after
a
hard
days
work
i
have
not
been
impressed
with
much
from
blue
moon
lately
but
this
one
i
can
say
is
impressively
different
goes
well
with
anne
murray
music
and
when
you
touch
me
i
just
fall
in
loooove
agaaain
nothing
offensive
here
except
this
isnt
a
belgain
pale
ale
in
my
book
malt
flavors
are
a
lot
like
a
vienna
lager
and
really
not
that
bad
its
just
not
a
bel
pale
ale
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
remotely
resembles
a
belgian
pale
ale
in
any
way
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
much
more
like
an
american
pale
or
even
a
cream
ale
i
find
it
hard
to
belief
they
even
used
a
belgian
yeast
strain
on
this
if
they
did
they
found
a
way
to
get
a
bizarrely
different
flavor
from
it
than
anyone
else
the
beer
for
what
its
worth
is
not
too
bad
and
easy
enough
to
drink
kind
of
bland
though
but
dont
buy
this
if
you
want
to
try
a
bpa
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
little
over
a
fingers
worth
of
head
no
lacing
at
all
smells
of
very
sweet
candy
sweet
fruit
and
agave
i
hate
agave
tastes
of
the
mildest
hops
i
have
ever
witnessed
sweet
cherry
follows
the
hops
and
reminded
me
of
a
nice
german
dunkel
also
has
a
weird
pennylike
taste
far
off
in
the
distance
the
taste
is
very
odd
to
say
the
least
although
fairly
good
the
mouthfeel
brings
out
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
sour
cherry
way
too
sour
for
that
matter
took
this
beer
from
being
fairly
good
to
some
kinda
girly
wine
cooler
overall
this
beer
was
okay
interesting
flavor
but
thats
about
it
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
not
a
bad
pale
ale
here
certainly
the
most
enjoyable
blue
moon
product
ive
come
across
this
wont
blow
the
roof
off
the
beer
world
but
its
approachable
and
entirely
drinkable
reminiscent
of
the
steelhead
extra
pale
ale
overall
3
0
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
understand
why
they
felt
the
need
to
put
hibiscus
in
it
but
hey
there
you
go
i
could
also
taste
the
orange
peel
that
they
claim
is
in
it
so
i
guess
they
thought
hey
lets
throw
some
plant
juice
in
there
too
regardless
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
could
function
as
a
session
beer
watch
that
5
4
abv
though
this
beer
was
kind
of
boring
for
a
belgian
style
i
expect
a
lot
more
flavor
even
for
a
guy
that
doesnt
like
the
normal
flavor
profiles
of
the
style
im
terribly
unimpressed
i
guess
this
is
where
the
fact
that
coors
brews
the
stuff
becomes
obvious
the
yeasty
spicey
flavor
is
somewhere
in
there
but
its
not
worth
finding
ummm
i
dont
think
so
unfortunately
i
didnt
drink
this
before
coors
got
their
hands
on
it
so
im
not
sure
but
its
complete
garbage
if
were
going
to
characterize
this
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
zero
head
not
much
carbonation
clear
rust
in
colour
lacking
in
any
real
depth
smells
like
honey
and
malt
but
i
dont
detect
any
yeast
a
hallmark
of
the
belgian
quite
malty
and
sweet
in
taste
but
not
wellbalanced
nice
dry
finish
never
buying
this
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
amberish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
fruity
some
malts
taste
is
malty
some
fruits
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
the
best
of
this
style
but
a
decent
beer
this
is
not
like
many
bpas
out
there
it
doesnt
have
any
hint
of
belgian
yeast
nor
the
traditional
spices
its
primarily
caramel
and
some
faint
floral
hops
its
a
pass
for
me
this
wont
impress
any
fans
of
belgian
ales
o
pretty
good
beer
overall
no
complaints
here
solidly
boring
atmosphere
is
okay
nice
hue
but
no
head
or
lacing
nose
is
full
and
robust
with
a
woody
and
italian
spice
character
flavor
is
robust
and
malty
with
a
pungent
aftertaste
overall
this
is
pretty
good
quaff
rjt
pours
a
translucent
copper
color
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
mild
and
unimpressive
the
first
sip
was
actually
not
bad
yielding
a
mild
somewhat
wheaty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
honeymoon
ends
there
though
with
subsequent
sips
unmasking
a
mishmash
of
dilute
wheat
and
nickel
i
dont
supposed
ive
ever
actually
tasted
nickel
but
i
expect
it
would
taste
an
awful
lot
like
this
a
cheap
wheaty
fog
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
throat
for
way
too
long
and
further
imbibing
offers
little
relief
the
label
touts
cascade
hops
though
their
presence
is
subtle
and
used
to
ill
effect
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
out
of
this
brew
but
this
manages
to
fall
short
of
even
my
paltry
expectations
from
the
summer
variety
pack
pours
clear
copper
with
one
finger
of
white
head
some
minor
lacing
smell
is
floral
and
citrus
taste
is
sweet
tangy
malts
tart
yeastiness
and
minor
citrus
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
perfect
carbonation
finishes
medium
dry
good
emulation
of
the
style
nice
introduction
to
belgian
pale
ale
from
an
american
perspective
o
not
a
great
beer
not
a
bad
beer
considering
i
spent
a
dollar
a
bottle
much
better
than
i
expected
o
this
is
okay
maybe
it
could
convert
some
one
to
craft
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
smell
was
a
little
off
but
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
was
good
worth
a
try
and
very
drinkable
at
5

pale
moon
pours
a
copperamber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
with
very
light
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
light
with
hints
of
caramel
toasted
and
biscuity
malt
notes
present
as
well
as
some
orange

and
spice
as
noticed
in
the
nose
this
beer
features
a
heavy
malt
presence
out
front
and
very
little
hop
profile
noticeable
this
medium
bodied
ale
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
for
the
price
and
the
ease
of
locating
a
good
deal
poured
from
brown
12oz
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
ruby
amber
color
with
a
decent
fingers
width
whitish
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
somewhat
muted
but
consists
of
citrus
and
wheat
with
a
hint
of
spice
coriander
the
flavor
starts
with
a
malty
sweet
base
from
which
the
citrus
fruit
character
and
wheat
builds
mildly
bitter
with
a
good
hop
character
finishes
slightly
dry
and
crisp
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
go
and
actively
pursue
it
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
either
o
forgettable
o
this
beer
seemed
to
be
a
bit
too
malty
and
sweet
for
the
style
and
could
have
used
some
more
hop
bitterness
its
definitely
not
as
drinkable
compared
to
the
blue
moon
witbier
overall
this
is
a
rather
average
brew
of
the
blue
moon
varieties
this
one
is
likely
on
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
its
ok
but
i
would
take
other
blue
moon
varieties
over
this
one
if
given
the
chance
oreally
nothing
here
to
remember
what
else
should
one
expect
from
bmc
finally
finishing
my
blue
moon
winter
variety
pack
damn
its
been
a
while
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
tawnyamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
dirtywhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
biscuit
light
greens
and
a
touch
of
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
greens
are
joined
by
strong
grass
and
light
pine
needles
to
form
a
gang
of
bittering
hooligans
that
mess
with
the
already
kinda
soso
status
quo
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
pedestrian
bpa
at
best
one
that
tries
too
hard
to
be
all
belgainy
and
pale
aley
without
actually
succeeding
much
at
either
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
bubbly
head
the
slowly
disappears
has
some
mild
scents
of
hops
and
some
grains
has
a
slighty
bitter
tone
to
the
taste
some
bready
dough
and
yeast
tastes
as
well
has
an
overall
dryer
taste
than
most
of
the
blue
moon
line
crisp
and
extremely
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
about
it
decent
for
a
macrobrew
but
about
average
among
mircobrews
overall
some
pretty
good
flavors
going
on
here
for
a
macro
brew
a
pleasant
surprise
taste
is
citrusy
slightly
sweet
and
grassy
overall
pleasant
on
the
tounge
with
just
enough
bittering
from
the
hops
to
save
it
from
being
too
sodalike
overall
nothing
bad
nothing
special
something
to
throw
back
without
thinking
too
much
the
beer
is
definitely
not
a
belgian
pale
ale
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
decent
drink
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
for
myself
not
bad
i
would
prefer
harvest
moon
over
it
but
id
say
pretty
close
i
have
always
like
blue
moon
never
really
loved
it
though
maybe
it
is
because
i
prefer
darker
and
more
hopped
beers
in
the
summer
when
im
am
looking
for
a
descent
beer
to
casually
drink
i
will
more
often
then
none
choose
blue
moon
a
little
sweet
though
sometimes
d
okay
an
okay
pale
ale
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
flavor
presenation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
poured
this
belgian
pale
ale
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
amber
color
produced
a
off
white
head
with
average
retention
and
below
average
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
ale
was
faint
wheat
and
coriander
light
in
body
this
ale
is
very
sweet
some
toasted
malt
very
fruity
although
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
fruit
not
a
lot
of
balance
here
not
much
to
talk
about
other
then
its
just
not
a
very
good
beer
o
a
style
that
blue
moon
did
not
try
too
hard
to
make
will
not
buy
again
i
dont
know
why
they
call
it
a
belgian
pale
ale
tolerable
but
not
special
in
any
way
wont
seek
out
ever
ok
but
not
fabulous
this
is
a
very
safe
belgian
that
doesnt
take
any
chances
overall
crisp
and
and
light
seems
more
like
an
adjunct
lager
than
any
type
of
ale
o
a
mid
range
ale
made
by
one
of
the
big
giants
coors
but
i
wont
knock
it
without
giving
a
fair
shot
and
it
impressed
me
a
little
bit
this
is
an
example
of
consumerism
affecting
the
market
and
big
corporations
trying
to
buy
into
the
small
craft
brew
scene
it
deff
has
some
nice
flavor
for
something
out
of
the
coors
brewery
malty
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
spices
easy
drinker
and
probably
one
of
the
best
macros
out
there
i
got
this
as
part
of
the
winter
sampler
and
would
buy
again
in
a
pinch
its
interesting
not
amazing
but
interesting
and
fun
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
it
seems
drinkable
until
you
get
far
into
it
and
then
it
grows
old
overall
my
favorite
of
the
moon
series
if
you
like
blue
moon
but
think
its
too
complex
or
heavy
definitely
try
this
beer
o
yum
id
get
again
better
than
the
blue
moon
imo
o
decent
brew
with
more
flavor
than
i
am
used
to
from
its
brewery
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
relatively
surprised
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
out
i
must
say
people
are
being
way
too
harsh
on
this
beer
being
that
its
from
bmc
its
a
stab
at
a
rare
style
from
them
and
its
actually
pretty
good
and
refreshing
nice
floral
aroma
touch
of
hops
and
some
dark
malts
finishes
smooth
not
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
above
average
for
the
price
its
hard
to
beat
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
just
ignore
the
label
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
a
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
faint
dry
yeatiness
in
the
taste
dry
sugar
to
a
sweet
fruitiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
ok
somewhat
pedestrian
o
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
didnt
seem
like
this
was
a
good
example
for
the
style
nor
a
good
beer
overall
id
pass
on
this
in
the
future
i
enjoy
the
occasional
blue
moon
ale
but
this
beer
really
disappointed
it
lacks
any
decent
qualities
and
i
dont
know
who
would
drink
it
too
void
of
flavor
for
craft
beer
drinkers
and
not
enough
for
main
stream
drinkers
to
consume
o
eh
drinkable
not
much
in
taste
intense
carbonation
hurts
a
bit
really
just
not
much
all
together
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
with
no
lacing
and
clear
amberorange
color
aroma
is
a
malty
forefront
with
a
spicy
background
flavor
is
a
balanced
blend
of
sweet
malt
and
muted
hops
some
of
the
added
spices
were
detected
but
not
overpowering
a
good
subtle
effect
mouthfeel
is
light
and
co2
is
adequate
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
anything
that
would
satisfy
hophungry
craft
beer
drinkers
that
is
why
it
gets
such
mediocre
marks
here
overall
nice
and
mild
slightly
roasty
very
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
i
work
at
a
grocery
store
that
stocks
this
and
am
pretty
sure
we
sell
a
6
pack
per
week
shame
it
deserves
better
than
that
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
alland
i
am
no
fan
of
the
coors
company
as
long
as
the
price
is
rightand
it
was
with
thisit
wont
be
my
last
one
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
its
a
little
generic
in
taste
but
not
boring
either
still
tastes
good
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
sight
and
smell
made
me
think
it
was
going
to
have
some
bite
quite
the
opposite
bland
and
forgettable
dr
pretty
drinkable
quite
affordable
for
an
import
and
decent
quality
id
have
it
again
especially
if
it
were
on
draught
unbiased
didnt
know
it
was
a
coors
when
i
bought
the
sixpack
certainly
drinkable
and
quite
pleasant
as
a
first
beer
after
emerging
from
irene
hibernation
maybe
not
the
long
taste
of
a
belgian
but
i
would
put
it
in
with
other
pale
ales
5
to
go
which
will
be
nice
when
i
get
to
them
belgian
pale
is
a
style
of
beer
underrepresented
in
american
craft
beer
pale
moon
showcases
enough
belgian
yeast
ester
to
stand
out
from
a
regular
pale
ale
yet
still
be
sessionable
if
you
want
to
taste
a
little
yeast
in
your
pale
and
experience
a
good
introduction
to
a
somewhat
obscure
style
give
this
one
a
try
overall
i
definitely
preferred
this
beer
over
blue
moons
honey
wheat
beer
this
one
aligns
itself
more
closely
to
the
pale
ale
style
than
honey
wheat
ever
will
to
its
respective
style
maybe
the
best
of
the
blue
moon
series
very
enjoyable
but
still
not
as
good
as
a
craft
beer
it
is
not
a
bad
brew
on
the
palate
the
toasted
malt
and
light
wheat
character
add
an
interesting
twist
its
just
that
this
is
waaay
different
than
any
belgian
pale
i
have
ever
had
it
seems
like
it
would
fare
decently
well
in
an
amber
ale
category
though
the
yeast
is
very
weak
barely
adding
even
a
modest
fruit
character
very
unbelgian
its
a
malt
driven
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
body
and
adequate
carbonation
i
guess
my
scores
reflect
a
combo
of
stylistic
fit
and
plain
ol
enjoyability
as
a
bpa
it
would
get
a
d
but
as
an
amber
ale
of
some
sort
would
probably
get
a
b
i
didnt
have
much
difficulty
finishing
my
12
oz
sample
and
well
leave
it
at
that
flavor
is
similarly
light
in
body
touching
on
citrics
but
only
perfunctorily
hibiscus
jumps
in
for
a
minute
too
wheat
like
in
terms
of
drinkability
light
overall
not
desirable
but
acceptable
this
beer
poured
out
as
an
amber
color
it
has
a
light
tan
head
on
top
that
leaves
a
light
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
decent
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
was
crisp
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
was
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
surprisingly
o
nothing
stands
out
about
this
beer
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
of
extra
beer
from
a
friend
after
a
party
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
a
good
beer
not
very
complicated
but
its
nice
to
see
coors
trying
to
make
an
ale
and
not
look
like
fools
doing
it
o
overall
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
blue
moon
well
enjoyed
from
the
style
description
in
lieu
of
direction
on
the
bottle
they
should
be
decanted
properly
leaving
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
i
did
not
see
much
if
any
yeast
in
the
bottle
but
i
bore
it
in
mind
as
i
poured
i
am
pretty
sure
that
this
was
filtered
but
i
was
careful
all
the
same
which
resulted
in
mere
wisps
for
head
win
some
lose
some
color
was
a
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
cu
colored
who
they
tryin
ta
zoom
nose
had
a
distinctive
honey
odor
could
this
be
what
the
hibiscus
was
adding
if
anything
mouthfeel
was
actually
pretty
full
not
outright
creamy
but
close
the
taste
was
bland
for
all
of
the
adjuncts
that
they
mention
it
was
pale
all
right
pale
in
flavor
i
got
a
tealike
flavor
in
the
mouth
and
whether
it
could
be
attributed
to
either
the
hibiscus
or
the
hops
i
do
not
know
finish
was
grassy
somewhat
tealike
but
just
not
a
lot
happening
this
was
not
bad
just
boring
a
decent
beer
if
blue
moon
products
were
sold
at
a
price
reflecting
their
quality
they
would
be
a
constant
in
my
fridge
i
hope
they
lower
the
price
a
few
dollars
soon
yea
thatll
happen
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
cup
o
tea
pale
moon
is
a
very
clear
very
sparkling
light
amber
ale
with
a
sparse
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
it
has
a
faint
aroma
of
light
grain
and
a
little
spice
there
is
a
note
of
apple
it
has
a
very
lively
medium
light
body
with
a
slightly
gritty
finish
its
pretty
lightly
flavored
and
well
balanced
there
are
some
fruity
esters
and
a
little
phenol
a
botanical
bitterness
comes
at
the
finish
i
wouldnt
go
after
one
of
these
on
purpose
but
its
certainly
a
better
option
than
most
macro
brews
again
another
very
ordinary
beer
from
coors
the
style
suggests
at
least
some
complexity
but
this
beer
much
like
the
blue
moon
flagship
witbier
is
dull
and
lacking
of
so
many
elements
a
watery
imposter
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
only
because
id
never
had
it
worse
than
blue
moon
and
really
devoid
of
any
character
whatsoever
poured
a
decent
copper
color
with
minimal
head
not
much
going
on
aromawise
aside
from
a
little
malt
on
the
palate
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
little
malt
and
some
apple
skins
tastes
like
nothing
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
really
thin
no
flavors
at
all
nothing
hello
bargh
what
a
waste
i
am
not
a
belgium
pale
ale
expert
so
i
really
dont
know
if
blue
moon
nailed
this
beer
or
not
i
will
say
that
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
taste
the
color
was
more
amber
and
clear
there
was
not
head
and
it
did
not
lace
obviously
the
nose
was
disappointing
for
me
cuz
i
could
not
smell
much
of
anything
usually
i
like
to
smell
some
hop
pine
citrus
or
something
with
my
pales
but
not
here
the
taste
was
decent
nicely
balanced
and
not
overly
belgiumie
i
am
not
a
fan
of
belgium
style
beers
mouthfeel
is
good
and
definitely
worth
a
taste
overall
eh
i
feel
like
for
an
american
interpretation
fat
tire
wows
me
a
bit
more
this
one
isnt
bad
but
overall
im
unimpressed
o
have
had
my
share
of
this
a
few
years
back
but
now
it
gives
me
a
headache
to
be
honest
not
sure
why
as
a
faux
craft
beer
its
average
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
fails
imho
it
has
its
place
though
as
for
me
when
i
see
a
non
ba
or
noncraft
beer
enthusiast
drinking
this
i
see
someone
that
knows
there
is
flavor
in
beers
beyond
adjunct
lagers
basically
its
a
gateway
to
better
beer
imho
and
for
that
it
has
its
place
for
a
coors
offering
not
bad
and
certainly
way
better
than
the
crap
they
usually
make
it
is
not
as
good
as
blue
moon
and
certainly
not
deserving
of
the
title
of
belgian
pale
ale
pretty
weak
for
the
style
but
not
terrible
overall
m
d
not
that
fanastic
mild
and
bland
in
general
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
of
all
the
brews
out
there
this
isnt
anywhere
near
a
must
have
for
anyone
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
jun0611do5102219
sampled
on
march
27
2011
its
ambercopper
color
is
about
right
for
a
standard
pale
ale
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
less
clarity
caramel
malts
and
maybe
a
dash
of
clove
are
evident
in
the
aroma
with
a
slight
touch
of
yeast
toward
the
back
the
body
comes
in
at
around
medium
sweet
malts
prevail
in
the
taste
rather
than
the
wheat
spices
and
yeast
elements
i
have
come
to
associate
with
this
style
but
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
d
drinks
nicelyvery
sessionable
its
thinner
for
a
pale
ale
but
its
nice
im
not
sure
how
its
a
belgian
pale
in
style
though
a
pretty
good
beer
but
watered
down
drinks
fine
and
is
interesting
enough
to
keep
interest
if
in
a
pinch
it
appears
coors
is
trying
to
compete
seriously
in
the
craft
market
they
have
some
work
to
do
but
are
doing
more
than
the
other
big
beer
companies
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
between
light
and
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
its
probably
the
smoothest
drinking
blue
moon
incarnation
ive
had
though
its
fairly
drinkable
but
calling
this
a
belgian
pale
ale
is
a
bit
of
a
crime
in
my
opinion
d
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
it
is
115
better
than
blue
moon
the
original
it
was
surprisingly
delicious
but
is
not
delicious
for
its
style
if
this
was
labeled
an
english
bitter
i
would
have
rated
it
an
a
very
reminiscent
of
old
thumper
with
a
bit
more
hoppy
life
to
it
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
ring
around
the
rim
rather
quickly
amber
body
with
a
hint
of
redness
extreme
floral
scent
smells
like
potpourri
and
grass
very
complex
flavor
but
not
very
balanced
for
my
preferences
which
dont
tend
to
favor
overbearing
hoppiness
an
assault
on
the
tongue
with
medium
hop
bitterness
and
overbearing
grassy
notes
im
not
a
fan
of
pale
ales
but
i
will
do
my
best
to
grade
within
a
style
im
not
familiar
with
i
think
the
hoppy
bitterness
is
probably
balanced
within
the
style
if
not
to
my
liking
with
strong
notes
of
tobacco
and
acetaldehyde
i
imagine
this
would
go
over
well
with
the
pa
crowd
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finish
if
i
felt
particularly
violent
and
manly
i
might
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
given
night
they
just
feel
aggressive
in
my
mouth
i
cant
promote
a
beer
that
needs
an
orange
slice
to
make
it
taste
better
or
at
least
try
to
taste
better
i
tried
a
pint
of
this
and
could
not
drink
anymore
after
that
pint
i
had
to
switch
beers
to
me
this
might
be
more
of
a
ladies
type
of
beer
i
cant
see
a
bar
full
of
men
drinking
beer
with
oranges
in
it
ive
usually
have
the
original
blue
moon
and
i
was
impressed
with
the
pal
ale
version
still
holds
true
to
the
citrus
flavor
that
reminds
you
its
a
blue
moon
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
blue
moon
and
a
good
tasting
pale
ale
with
a
crisp
orange
taste
dvery
not
too
controversial
but
solid
for
the
line
its
been
my
favorite
of
the
blue
moon
varieties
so
far
and
i
would
drink
it
again
because
its
really
not
bad
for
a
beer
that
is
easily
accessable
and
not
overly
pricey
its
good
but
the
orange
flavor
is
a
little
overpowering
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
very
many
served
chilled
poured
into
an
american
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
hazel
colour
with
a
thin
nut
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
nut
as
well
very
mild
in
flavor
a
little
syrupy
on
the
finish
well
rounded
not
as
bitter
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
pale
ale
and
much
richer
minimal
carbonation
i
wasnt
anticipating
enjoying
this
beer
but
it
has
paid
off
very
well
entirely
drinkable
pours
a
deep
hazed
orange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
spice
and
citrus
as
well
as
that
typical
witbier
smell
tastes
of
light
spices
a
little
hops
and
a
little
orange
citrus
flavor
mouthfeel
is
normal
for
style
and
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
decent
more
of
the
same
in
flavor
with
caramel
and
some
orange
flavors
up
front
and
some
spice
after
that
finishes
a
bit
sweet
yet
offers
a
flash
of
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
comes
across
as
an
english
pale
in
body
and
feel
given
the
light
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
over
other
pale
ales
on
the
market
but
definetly
wouldnt
turn
this
one
down
not
undrinkable
and
a
nice
try
this
beer
is
an
excellent
beer
for
beginning
beer
drinkers
or
someone
who
is
brand
new
to
the
craft
beer
world
because
it
is
extremely
drinkable
for
a
pale
ale
with
all
that
being
said
it
isnt
a
very
good
beer
its
not
horrible
but
it
is
pretty
close
to
being
a
below
average
beer
the
aroma
is
very
light
you
only
pick
up
a
slight
smell
of
hops
and
floral
notes
the
appearance
isnt
horrible
not
much
head
at
all
disappears
quickly
but
the
lacing
is
decent
definitely
the
best
factor
appearance
wise
the
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
only
a
slight
hop
bite
only
a
tiny
bit
of
a
floral
taste
you
do
get
a
nice
unique
taste
from
the
hibiscus
but
that
is
really
the
only
redeeming
factor
taste
wise
for
a
pale
ale
there
just
is
no
where
near
as
much
hops
as
there
should
be
in
this
beer
curious
and
welldone
and
quite
drinkable
id
consider
this
one
a
starter
towards
moving
into
the
more
complex
ipas
overall
it
was
better
then
most
of
their
offerings
but
again
that
is
not
saying
alot
still
worked
for
a
quick
refresher
before
more
shoveling
overall
pale
moon
is
another
respectable
entry
from
coors
foray
into
craft
beer
as
is
the
case
with
most
of
the
beers
in
this
lineup
its
a
toned
down
version
of
the
style
that
the
average
beer
drinker
will
try
like
you
can
do
better
but
you
can
definitely
do
worse
too
pale
moon
comes
out
a
lovely
amber
color
with
brownish
highlights
medium
thick
firm
foam
head
visible
carbonation
from
the
nucleation
point
of
the
perfect
pint
aromatic
sweetly
hoppy
balanced
smell
malts
just
a
touch
off
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
easily
the
best
aroma
from
any
coors
product
ive
ever
had
taste
is
mildly
hopped
with
a
nice
biscuity
malt
backbone
sturdy
taste
more
good
balance
i
pick
up
some
strange
sort
of
hamlike
flavors
feel
is
still
a
little
thin
more
body
needed
overall
a
pretty
sessionable
beer
and
probably
the
best
of
the
blue
moon
lineup
more
flavor
and
aroma
here
than
the
usual
craft
beers
from
bmc
a
half
decent
try
at
the
midrange
pale
ales
of
belgium
its
tried
to
be
some
where
between
fat
tire
and
de
koninck
and
palm
ale
but
lands
somewhere
else
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
i
has
a
nice
copper
color
with
not
a
lot
of
head
to
it
the
aroma
isnt
much
to
talk
about
a
lite
smell
of
carmel
and
you
need
to
search
for
that
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
it
feels
a
little
undercarbonated
but
otherwise
is
alright
its
also
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
theres
no
problems
drinking
this
this
is
an
alright
beer
its
not
worth
buying
the
blue
moon
12
pack
sampler
just
to
try
but
if
you
like
the
normal
blue
moon
and
the
seasonal
its
not
a
bad
throwin
this
is
the
best
if
the
moon
brews
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
decent
lasting
head
smells
of
faint
belgian
aromas
and
a
nice
pop
of
american
hops
taste
follows
suit
some
light
belgian
stylings
with
decent
cascade
hops
on
the
palate
i
actually
really
liked
this
with
a
bowl
of
spicy
chili
wish
i
had
another
to
follow
up
with
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
very
nice
pale
and
munich
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
along
with
a
delicate
hop
bitterness
and
a
good
yeast
fruitiness
the
esters
arent
as
pronounced
as
a
traditional
bpa
but
the
subtle
character
suits
this
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
starter
belgian
ale
its
nothing
like
the
traditional
style
but
for
people
who
are
new
to
yeast
esters
its
a
solid
choice
overall
definitely
my
least
favorite
in
the
blue
moon
family
drink
just
wanted
to
try
it
probably
wont
have
it
again
notes
didnt
really
wow
me
nor
did
this
really
remind
me
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
any
belgian
ale
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
all
i
really
picked
up
was
some
spice
and
herbaltea
flavors
on
top
of
some
caramel
malt
was
pretty
bland
with
those
flavors
as
well
i
would
just
rather
grab
a
blue
moon
than
this
if
i
were
picking
up
a
beer
from
this
line
d
i
can
drink
alot
of
these
no
problem
yummy
beer
so
judging
it
as
its
own
weird
thing
this
is
okay
its
not
a
belgian
pale
and
i
frankly
dont
like
that
its
labeled
as
such
because
this
is
a
crossover
beer
and
beergeek
neophytes
shouldnt
be
told
that
this
is
something
that
it
aint
but
aside
from
that
this
is
okay
not
great
but
totally
okay
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
i
really
didnt
mind
it
and
actually
found
it
to
be
above
average
in
the
realm
of
coors
and
its
profile
pale
moon
is
not
my
preferred
belgian
pale
ale
however
a
good
entry
point
to
the
more
complex
belgian
pale
ales
d
chaching
heres
what
they
can
take
straight
to
the
bank
drinkability
its
lacking
everywhere
else
but
it
certainly
does
have
drinkability
i
however
find
it
to
be
empty
calories
with
no
flavor
so
ill
be
handing
this
pint
to
my
brother
drinkability
a
really
subpar
beer
if
theyre
aiming
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
however
its
not
that
bad
if
you
think
of
it
as
a
coors
product
still
its
not
something
i
think
ill
have
again
anytime
soon
d
this
was
certainly
a
pleasant
surprise
it
wont
cause
you
to
redefine
your
conception
of
belgians
but
it
has
distinct
strong
flavors
a
rarity
for
bmc
very
clear
for
a
pale
ale
this
orangeamber
colored
beer
pours
with
a
cloudlike
finger
and
a
half
head
smells
strongly
of
cascade
hops
and
light
spices
which
is
contrary
to
the
taste
very
light
in
flavor
very
thin
bodied
but
easily
drinkable
a
good
beginners
pale
ale
nothing
totally
offensive
but
it
drinks
more
like
a
spiced
american
amber
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
theres
such
a
high
standard
for
belgians
of
any
variety
this
sort
of
soso
american
attempt
is
pretty
weak
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
real
deal
but
in
a
blind
taste
test
you
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
not
be
ashamed
of
it
d
malty
no
smell
but
not
disgusting
sessionable
for
sure
but
not
very
enjoyable
poured
out
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
had
a
good
head
on
it
that
left
a
slight
bit
of
lace
on
the
sides
as
it
disappeared
the
orange
color
was
very
clear
and
showed
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
aroma
lent
a
bit
of
hoppiness
and
a
tad
of
citrus
the
taste
was
very
crisp
and
fresh
a
fairly
decent
tasting
pale
ale
not
overpowering
a
decently
light
very
drinkable
beer
d
not
terrible
though
not
a
suggested
introduction
as
to
how
great
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
really
are
even
some
above
average
ones
are
way
better
than
this
one
decent
drinkability
not
offensive
but
nothing
spectacular
at
least
it
isnt
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
honey
moon
easily

brew
to

poured
from
the
bottle
into

one

head
dissipating
into

smell
was
biscuity
and
mild
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
but
nothing
compared
to
real
pale
ales
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
big
bubbles
drinkability
was
very
good
this
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
some
to
the
pale
ale
world
until
they
can
try
a
real
one
not
too
much
going
on
with
it
but
it
is
overall
a
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
pale
dont
turn
your
nose
up
at
it
based
on
the
label
drinkability
not
really

sitting
on
this
for

you
could
have
more
than
one
not
as
strong

and
taste
as
some
pale

but
decent
overall
drinkability
the
best
blue
moon
coors
product
ive
had
to
date
pale
moon
poured
a
typical
pale
ale
color
with
a
smaller
head
the
smell
was
typical
of
a
pale
ale
but
much
weaker
the
taste
was
also
the
same
typical
pale
ale
dry
and
bitter
but
had
an
almost
watered
down
flavor
it
was
easier
to
drink
then
other
pale
ales
overall
not
bad
there
is
certinaly
better
out
there
though
d
this
was
a
nice
gesture
but
its
not
something
i
can
see
myself
buying
i
will
admit
that
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
drinkability
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
by
coors
but
blue
moon
brews
are
still
overpriced
for
what
they
are
and
i
doubt
i
ever
buy
the
summer
mix

that
this
beer
came
in
d
good
id
love
another
at
a
sunny
bbq
or
a
bar
id
consider
buying
a
sixer
but
only
as
a
second
tier
fallback
d
easy
to
put
down
more
than
one
of
these
but
why
bother
not
something
id
try
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear

the

is

some

light
mouthfeel
and
medium

a
average

beer
not
something
anyone
should
seek
out
this
beer
pours
dark
golden
or
copper

this
beer
was
difficult
to
pour
as
the
head

nearly
foamed
over
this
beer
has
no
mouth
feel
as
it
and
finishes
smooth
there
is
no
hop
aroma
or
bitterness
this
beer
is
all
sweet
and
malt
flavor
remains
through
out
well
its
a
far
cry
from

there
are
mild

belgianstyles
this
is
not
one
of
them
its
not
bad
its
smooth

not
hard

i
think
this
is

this

was
super
bitter
and
ultimately
not
worth
finishing
it
didnt
taste
like
a
belgium

overwhelmingly
sour

one

the

overtook
the

with
slight
variations
on
different
styles
you
can
definitely
tell
that
this
is
a
macrobrewery
disguising
as
a
craft
but
at
least
they
are
trying
this
is
pretty
bad
well
i
shouldnt
say
bad
its
just
so
overly
safe
and
dumbed
down
from
real
belgian
pales
as
to
be
a
new
style
entirely
really
frustrating
that
people
out
there
who
dont
know
any
better
think
this
is
craft
belgian
pale
man
are
they
missing
something
its
got
a
really
subtle
belgian
yeast
nose
and
even
less
on
the
taste
just
a
slight
sharp
white
wine
acidity
and
fruit
complexion
the
malt
base
is
super
light
too
light
really
and
all
the
hops
ever
are
is
a
balancing
bitterness
with
a
light
grassy
character
but
basically
no
hop
flavor
its
just
such
a
simplified
version
of
a
great
style
in
all
three
aspects
that
its
disappointing
to
me
weird
grain
funk
in
the
middle
of
this
and
it
doesnt
go
well
with
the
yeast
it
tastes
and
feels
like
it
was
fermented
too
warm
and
its
just
not
real
nice
overall
one
thing
that
does
work
though
is
the
carbonation
its
dry
and
fizzy
and
full
of
life
which
is
its
best
feature
by
far
overall
this
may
get
a
few
people
into
the
style
but
its
so
safe
and
bland
that
i
really
dont
care
for
it
at
all
my
ba
profile
says
ive
not
yet
reviewed
a
belgian
pale
however
ive
definitely
drank
a
few
of
this
style
im
not
sure
how
truetostyle
this
beer
is
but
it
is
definitely
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
purchased
as
part
of
a
fall
variety
12
pack
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
pack
presentation
packaged
in
a
customembossed
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
samuel
adam
boston
lager
sensory
glass
overall
an
ok
brew
a
nice
fall
beer
id
have
it
again
overall
pretty
bad
at
first
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
still
has
an
odd
stale
cardboard
character
to
it
the
verdict
its
good
to
my
surprise
this
is
actually
a
nicely
done
pale
ale
nothing
great
but
much
better
than
i
expected
as
with
all
things
macrobrewed
the
taste
has
been
muted
overall

im
kind
of
sick
of
mediocre
beers
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
whatever
very
n
ice
i
was
surprised
by
this
macro
version
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
it
poured
a
dark
slightly
cloudy
brown
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
was
fruity
with
caramel
and
that
mouthwatering
belgian
aroma
the
taste
was
great
with
caramel
earthy
hops
moderately
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
banana
esters
although
i
am
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
this
style
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
a
sampler
pack
at
a
neighborhood
pig
roast
and
would
definitely
purchase
a
case
if
it
is
affordable
overall
worse
than
the
regular
blue
moon
which
i
actually
dont
stick
my
nose
up
at
because
of
the
weird
astringent
earthiness
would
not
recommend
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
if
it
was
between
this
and
domestic
american
adjunct
lagers
i
would
take
this
every
time
with
a
grin
on
my
face
its
pretty
light
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
really
offend
unfortunately
it
doesnt
impress
or
stand
out
either
so
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
overall
a
somewhat
tepid
offering
by
a
large
international
brewery
i
love
blue
moon
but
this
one
isnt
nearly
as
good
while
it
had
some
potential
in
the
burntcaramel
notes
the
malt
isnt
strong
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
bitter
citrus
and
carbonation
of
this
brew
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
and
would
choose
the
original
blue
moon
over
this
variety
anyway
of
the
week
clear
amber
pour
with
an
average
head
that
rapidly
diminishes
lacing
retention
is
poor
nose
is
light
but
has
citrus
and
caramel
notes
light
medium
bodied
with
a
normal
carbonation
level
that
produces
some
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
light
citrus
note
that
flows
into
an
equally
light
caramel
sweetness
the
finish
is
somewhat
crisp
but
has
a
lingering
spiciness
that
is
nice
a
solid
session
lawnmower
beer
o
balanced
pale
ale
o
easy
enough
to
drink
but
there
is
not
really
anything
interesting
that
makes
me
want
to
grab
another
one
of
these
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
it
was
tasty
and
full
of
flavor
it
wasnt
the
best
tasting
beer
ive
had
but
it
was
really
good
i
got
it
in
the
sampler
pack
and
it
was
the
first
one
i
pulled
out
i
could
defiantly
taste
the
orange
peel
in
it
blue
moon
is
great
at
making
tasty
beers
cheers
o
this
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
was
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
overall
good
price
point
which
saves
this
beer
from
a
mediocre
score
pours
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
of
honeycaramel
and
malts
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
by
being
dominated
by
the
honey
and
caramel
flavors
i
found
this
beer
to
be
perfectly
sweet
and
really
enjoyed
it
only
wish
the
winter
sampler
had
come
with
more
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
nothing
special
musty
malts
dirty
grains
bitterness
oxidized
notes
orange
pith
and
herbal
astringencies
id
rather
not
go
into
any
more
negatives
mouthfeel
included
taste
is
fairly
mute
with
caramel
malt
providing
the
majority
of
the
flavor
slight
spiciness
in
the
aftertaste
that
quickly
fades
a
nice
creamy
body
exists
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
full
feeling
which
is
more
than
it
deserves
overall
overall
a
bit
meh
for
a
beer
dont
really
care
for
it
but
i
guess
i
will
drink
it
in
the
seasonal
packs
o
a
decent
beer
that
grows
on
me
as
i
drink
this
is
a
nice
pale
it
has
bold
deep
hop
flavor
the
label
says
belgian
style
pale
and
i
guess
thats
supposed
to
mean
belgian
style
pale
ale
it
doesnt
remind
me
too
much
of
the
real
belgian
pale
ales
ive
had
nor
some
of
the
better
efforts
to
copy
the
style
from
other
countries
still
its
an
ok
beer
just
not
too
remarkable
poured
it
slightly
warm
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
thick
creamcolored
head
that
soon
settles
and
good
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
bark
old
wood
cardboard
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
spice
flavors
like
nose
more
intense
malt
really
comes
out
tang
of
course
bit
of
bitter
and
some
sweet
along
with
some
medicinal
body
is
big
and
full
but
at
first
has
a
powerful
warming
despite
its
strength
medicinal
component
leaves
an
unpleasant
lingering
bitterness
finish
is
as
stated
like
flavor
and
would
be
much
better
with
popcorn
or
something
to
cancel
the
off
flavors
overall
drinkable
but
another
not
so
impressive
beer
from
blue
moon
coors
to
good
health
and
good
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
slight
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
below
average
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
but
there
is
nothing
that
stands
out
as
memorable
about
this
one
overall
this
is
an
acceptable
beer
but
not
by
much
i
cant
handle
the
sweetness
for
very
long
but
i
know
some
people
who
will
enjoy
it
for
that
same
reason
just
keep
that
in
mind
if
you
try
it
if
balance
is
your
preference
it
wont
measure
up
but
if
you
like
the
taste
of
malt
sugars
you
may
fall
in
love
the
color
is
a
pale
orange
like
watereddown
tang
extra
points
from
me
for
a
quarterinch
head
that
maintains
throughout
most
of
the
session
and
for
some
minimal
lacing
not
much
happening
in
a
good
way
in
the
smell
department
at
all
some
sourness
a
bit
of
malt
mashed
root
veggies
so
i
stopped
smelling
this
one
the
taste
is
alright
starts
off
on
the
sweeter
side
with
some
faint
citrus
and
malt
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
some
allspice
and
cloves
then
more
sweetness
apparently
there
is
hibiscus
in
this
beer
now
i
had
a
tequilahibiscus
cocktail
a
few
years
ago
that
was
just
sublime
but
the
hibiscus
in
this
beer
is
burred
which
is
a
shame
its
a
drinkable
beer
for
sure
not
too
bubbly
a
nice
velvety
texture
at
times
it
warms
well
too
blue

rounder

35
overall
it
sure
looked
pretty
in
my
tulip
and
the
smell
was
inviting
but
there
wasnt
anything
in
the
pint
to
live
up
to
these
expectations
i
guess
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
certainly
didnt
love
it
either
35
o
a
somewhat
flavourful
brew
to
bad
that
i
enjoy
what
it
brings
to
the
table
pours
to
a
half
inch
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
that
is
permanent
color
is
light
ambergold
aroma
is
spicy
floral
orange
zest
and
caramel
flavor
is
caramel
malt
citrus
and
herbal
notes
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
moderate
co2
overall
this
belgian
pale
ale
is
spicy
tangy
but
the
flavors
build
up
on
the
tongue
and
begin
to
annoy
after
a
while
i
suppose
paired
with
the
right
food
it
would
be
better
to
drink
it
for
the
sake
of
drinking
beer
ill
pass
o
never
really
been
a
big
fan
of
blue
moon
although
i
do
appreciate
their
ambitiousness
lately
this
beer
is
mere
steps
from
being
a
great
beer
and
things
only
get
better
with
age
and
practice
right
overall
a
tasty
if
somewhat
mundane
version
of
this
style
slick
and
smooth
and
quite
refreshing
o
neither
awful
nor
spectacular
o
this
beer
just
isnt
there
its
like
a
belgo
pale
on
training
wheels
or
something
from
just
tasting
the
beer
i
can
tell
that
the
right
ingredients
are
in
there
but
just
not
enough
of
them
its
like
a
runner
that
takes
the
time
to
train
for
a
marathon
but
only
puts
out
50
at
the
race
you
know
its
in
there
somewhere
but
aaah
i
would
not
recommend
wasting
your
time

ale
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
worthy
trying
if
offered
or
on
tap
but
i
cant
see
me
buying
a
6pack
it
is
slightly
above
average
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
rjt
this
is
reminiscent
of
a
true
bpa
with
the
malt
or
whatever
the
hell
blue
moon
miller
coors
is
using
in
place
of
malt
but
there
isnt
any
belgian
yeast
flavor
here
probably
due
to
blue
moon
coors
skimping
on
it
and
instead
using
their
proprietary
bullshit
strain
of
whatever
bullshit
yeast
they
had
lying
around
and
were
able
to
make
a
lot
of
for
a
batch
of
beer
that
would
be
plentiful
enough
to
ship
to
all
the
grocery
stores
it
could
get
contracts
with
to
carry
it
where
it
would
sit
on
the
shelf
for
however
many
months
till
they
the
grocery
store
chain
would
be
forced
to
sell
it
at
an
even
more
discounted
price
at
which
point
poor
schlubs
like
myself
would
take
the
opportunity
to
try
it
on
a
whim
and
oh
yeah
there
arent
any
even
passable
belgian
pale
ales
on
the
grocery
store
shelf
save
for
the
ones
sam
adams
includes
in
their
current
variety
pack
in
which
the
rest
of
the
beers
pretty
much
suck
read
blackberry
wheat
nonsense
the
need
is
out
there
for
a
standard
american
belgian
pale
however
this
isnt
it
rounder
may
have
sucked
less
when
it
was
bottled
but
time
and
oxidation
has
not
been
kind
to
this
beer
i
fell
prey
to
this
as
i
didnt
have
to
buy
an
entire
blue
moon
sampler
to
get
to
try
a
new
beer
but
this
not
worth
it
even
for
7
in
summary
dont
rounder
wants
to
conjure
up
images
of
a
young
pokerplaying
matt
damon
matt
damon
but
sadly
this
beer
is
more
akin
to
him
and
his
performance
in
the
legend
of
bagger
vance
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
certainly
wont
please
any
true
belgian
beer
fans
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
of
the
great
bpa
flavors
i
would
expect
and
want
to
find
such
as
fruity
esters
or
nice
spicy
notes
from
the
yeast
this
is
more
of
a
malty
brew
with
citrusy
notes
from
the
addition
of
orange
peel
ultimately
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
pick
up
if
i
want
a
true
bpa
but
as
far
as
blue
moon
offerings
go
this
one
isnt
too
bad
o
overall
this
beer
was
alright
not
bad
but
not
original
still
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
i
would
not
turn
one
down
if
i
was
offered
its
got
both
smoothness
and
crispness
consistently
in
an
almost
maybe
even
medium
body
with
light
but
steadyflowing
carbonation
o
pretty
terrible
and
synthetic
almost
cloying
and
medicinal
drain
poured
half
the
bottle
where
are
the
hops
where
is
the
belgian
like
bad
fruit
juice
o
overall
the
flavor
is
quick
to
come
and
go
and
brief
initial
taste
sweet
wet
lemony
and
a
very
safe
play
that
treads
lightly
on
the
hops
lacks
a
strong
belgian
pale
grain
biscuity
nature
and
has
a
bit
to
much
sweet
speciality
grains
to
boot
lacks
crispness
and
is
about
as
exciting
as
kissing
your
cousin
pass
the
initial
brief
flavor
is
hardly
worth
the
price
of
admission
as
this
fnishes
like

not

a
patient
settling
resulted
in
a
dense
two
fingers
of
foamy
tawny
head
that
resembled
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
atop
a
cone
color
was
a
buttonbright
copper
nose
smelled
heavily
of
biscuit
malt
underlain
with
a
light
perfumey
floweriness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
tending
towards
sweet
kind
of
light
and
flowery
finish
was
semisweet
tasty
but
not
compelling
i
would
tell
you
that
there
are
better
iterations
interpretations
of
the
style
out
there
overall
average
at
best
for
a
belgian
i
started
this
beer
with
high
hopes
but
it
fell
a
little
bit
flat
taste
is
mildly
boring
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
really
not
much
to
it
average
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
o
this
beer
has
its
flaws
made
by
coors
its
an
attempt
at
a
macro
microbrew
it
felt
like
they
were
forcing
a
flavor
that
that
couldnt
develop
quite
right
there
are
some
good
points
but
not
redeemable
id
rather
a
real
microbrew
chased
with
a
coors
light
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
light
notes
of
yeast
taste
is
also
mild
bland
and
kind
of
boring
some
faint
yeast
and
malts
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
should
be
marketed
as
a
belgian
ale
light
sweet
lemony
scent
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
thin
small
whitish
non
lasting
head
no
lacing
of
glass
slightly
spicy
cinnamon
and
sweet
taste
candied
sweet
potato
beer
funky
aftertaste
smooth
overall
but
lacking
body
its
nice
for
a
sweet
beer
it
has
sweet
character
an
interesting
brew
o
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
clean
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
not
ready
for
some
of
the
beer
extremes
what
no
ed
norton
no
john
malkovich
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
thick
toffee
belgian
yeast
light
banana
candied
orange
peel
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
theres
less
toffee
and
what
is
there
is
drier
than
before
and
theres
a
stronger
emphasis
on
the
spicier
aspects
of
the
belgian
yeast
and
the
candied
orange
peel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
aint
exactly
a
bad
bpa
but
its
nothing
really
worth
revisiting
its
a
tastyenough
brew
to
take
down
amidst
the
other
offerings
in
the
12pack
but
its
nothing
id
really
recommend
on
its
own
underwhelmend
please
do
us
all
a
favor
if
you
drink
dont
drive
and
if
you
drive
dont
drink
overall
just
another
amber
ale
a
drinkable
but
pedestrian
belgian
pale
so
true
i
had
to
lift
this
sentiment
from
another
review
best
thing
i
could
say
this
would
work
in
a
maranaide
for
pork
or
chicken
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
quite
easy
drinking
brew
that
was
on
the
rather
cheap
side
14
for
a
12
pack
sampler
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
overall
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
blue
moon
variety
12pack
id
have
this
again
for
sure
a
soso
ale
not
the
worst
thing
ive
had
from
the
blue
moon
line
but
not
the
best
either
not
terrible
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
flavor
the
biggest
knock
is
there
is
nothing
remotely
belgian
about
this
even
by
bm
standards
this
is
way
out
of
the
style
it
is
classified
as
if
you
can
look
beyond
that
this
is
worth
trying
at
least
to
quench
your
thirst
c
have
ri
remark
that
this
is
pretty
distant
from
and
begian
pale
i
had
o
this
is
part
of
their
expressionist
collection
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
just
quite
plain
certainly
if
youre
looking
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
this
is
not
a
worthy
contender
but
a
mild
beer
overall
easy
to
drink
refreshing
grass
sugar
spiced
yeast
a
bit
funky
hints
of
spice
especially
clove
sweet
refreshing
hay
and
yeast
adding
up
well
with
the
spices
hints
of
honey
very
well
balanced
perfect
fitting
carbonation
which
leads
to
a
smooth
fresh
mouthfeel
clove
is
big
in
this
without
being
too
present
on
the
tastebuds
results
in
a
warm
yeast
supported
pleasant
finish
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
rather
ordinary
when
compared
to
its
namesakes
the
beer
has
a
nice
blond
color
which
is
a
bit
cloudy
in
its
aroma
it
combines
malt
yeast
and
some
fruit
accents
these
are
also
reappear
in
the
taste
where
the
fruit
accent
hints
at
the
combination
of
banana
and
citrus
the
most
amazing
is
the
balance
you
find
in
this
beer
definitely
a
benchmark
for
blond
abbeytrappist
style
beers
dark
golden
hued
with
good
clarity
a
fingernail
of
light
brown
head
covers
most
of
the
top
i
smell
light
malt
with
the
faint
hint
of
light
candy
sugar
the
flavor
is
comprised
of
light
candy
sugar
and
delicatelight
malt
theres
a
light
spice
note
in
the
malt
that
is
reminiscent
of
cardamom
and
a
touch
of
clove
but
it
is
brief
the
body
is
highly
carbonated
and
bone
dry
a
standard
for
abbey
blonds
with
that
special
sintsixtus
yeast
bringing
a
nice
bit
of
complexity
and
some
refreshing
hop
to
help
along
why
cant
there
be
another
belgium
blonde
less
than
7
this
good
no
usa
version
ever
comes
close
this
has
it
all
it
somehow
toes
the
line
of
flavor
fullness
and
lightness
perfectly
flavor
effervescence
aroma
even
surprising
hops
absolute
beauty
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
westys
very
well
put
together
and
drinkable
as
all
hell
nearing
its
bb
date
next
year
now
i
want
to
try
a
super
fresh
bottle
more
then
anything
de
minste
vd
bieren
van
bij
westvleteren
i
just
dont
care
for
many
blonde
ales
this
is
better
than
many
but
its
not
great
the
lack
of
malty
depth
let
the
esters
play
a
little
too
much
the
lacy
head
was
pleasant
though
still
spicier
than
i
care
for
serving
type
bottle
got
it
in
brussels
and
let
it
lager
for
3
months
its
golden
but
cloudy
from
yeast
the
aroma
is
weaker
than
i
expected
but
everything
else
is
wonderful
its
a
tad
spicy
but
wonderfully
fullbodied
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
slightly
dry
aftertaste
fresh
bottle
poured
at
kulminator
in
antwerp
pours
hazy
yellow
with
lots
of
yeasties
floating
around
and
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
straw
and
hops
plenty
of
yeast
and
light
fruits
flavor
is
slightly
dry
with
apples
and
pears
pairing
with
straw
a
bit
of
sweetness
balanced
with
hop
bite
tripel
funk
and
some
other
yeast
spice
light
bodied
medium
plus
carbonation
really
nice
brew
and
glad
i
have
some
bottles
to
take
home
overall
a
very
solid
beer
not
one
ill
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
but
its
clear
why
westvleteren
is
held
in
such
high
regard
overall
a
beautiful
beer
that
falls
short
only
where
it
concerns
aromatic
intensity
o
drank

2013
i
am
loving
this
experience
like
a
ride
through
farmers
fields
to
get
here
i
had
a
plate
of
their
cheese
and
bread
with
it
overall
a
really
nice
belgian
pale
ale
and
if
this
were
available
on
a
shelf
id
probably
pick
it
up
with
semi
regularity
however
since
its
not
i
wouldnt
recommend
going
to
any
great
lengths
to
obtain
it
verdict
a
nice
and
enjoyable
belgian
pale
ale
simple
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
im
not
convinced
this
is
the
freshest
bottle
and
this
is
not
a
style
i
believe
fares
well
with
age
so
id
love
to
revisit
this
beer
again
when
i
can
guarantee
freshness
still
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
definitely
enjoy
it
again
o
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
this
was
awesome
for
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
these
on
a
regular
basis
nice
complexity
flavorful
and
extremely
drinkable
definitely
worth
seeking
it
out
id
recommend
drinking
this
around
room
temperature
as
the
bitterness
fades
and
the
flavors
come
out
a
bit
more
bottle
shared
with
harrisoni
in
the
westvleteren
cafe
wow
what
a
beer
so
ian
built
this
one
up
for
me
as
an
amazing
beer
and
to
be
honest
i
was
sceptical
about
a
belgian
blond
however
it
is
a
revelation
and
took
some
of
the
shine
off
my
crates
of
westy
12
as
i
suddenly
wanted
some
of
this
to
take
home
too
gives
me
something
to
look
forward
to
next
time
very
bright
amber
and
fresh
looking
beer
up
close
theres
tiny
specks
of
grain
in
the
hazy
beer
bright
head
is
medium
to
full
and
fluffy
and
light
nose
is
a
big
burst
of
fresh
citrousy
lemony
hops
with
citrous
acidic
pithy
lemon
and
satsuma
crisp
yeast
taste
is
a
big
burst
of
lemony
hops
crisp
belgian
yeast
its
light
effervescent
and
leaves
a
tingling
lemon
citrous
bitterness
on
the
tongue
well
after
sipping
lovely
finish
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
lemon
curd
creaminess
to
it
light
as
a
feather
and
bursting
with
citrousy
hop
this
is
a
great
beer
and
probably
the
best
belgian
blonde
beer
ive
had
by
a
long
way
o
really
good
beer
but
slightly
overrated
super
nice
aroma
not
glaringly
rich
and
sweet
like
many
of
the
bpas
ive
had
nice
head
on
top
with
sediment
specks
all
throughout
the
head
and
glass
i
guess
it
was
a
long
ride
but
i
did
give
it
a
few
days
to
settle
head
simmers
to
just
a
fine
layer
very
nice
and
very
beautiful
on
the
pour
the
sediment
is
very
excusable
considering
its
journey
mild
hops
in
the
taste
almost
a
pilsner
kind
of
hoppiness
to
the
taste
but
otherwise
pilsnerlike
smooth
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
some
green
apple
some
hay
reminiscent
of
a
run
through
a
field
in
nebraska
i
have
never
been
anywhere
near
nebraska
maybe
its
all
the
movies
my
vocabulary
isnt
nearly
as
refined
as
some
of
these
other
reviewers
but
this
is
very
special
its
not
overwhelmingly
rich
and
sweet
like
some
of
the
wannabe
american
belgians
or
even
some
of
the
other
belgians
and
they
have
just
got
this
one
simply
right
the
shipping
was
a
bit
extraordinary
but
worth
it
considering
i
always
wanted
to
try
these
brews
this
would
be
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
if
it
were
available
around
the
block
licking
the
yeasty
sediment
of
the
bottle
its
very
sweet
alright
i
admit
i
french
licked
the
bottle
not
to
be
gross
but
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
on
the
inside
of
this
bottle
neck
mouthfeel
is
above
medium
in
heaviness
but
feels
really
good
and
satisfies
almost
as
if
i
had
eaten
a
small
meal
i
may
be
starstruck
due
to
the
celebrity
but
this
gets
very
high
ratings
from
me
if
it
were
of
the
same
difficulty
in
finding
as
pliny
i
would
say
this
one
would
get
my
attention
a
little
bit
more
for
awhile
at
least
a
world
class
belgian
blond
entirely
yeast
driven
and
absolutely
delicious
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
the
12
and
8
in
the
same
session
which
is
sort
of
a
once
in
a
lifetime
experience
this
is
hazy
pale
blond
in
color
with
over
an
inch
of
just
off
white
head
and
prickly
carbonation
the
nose
is
all
yeast
just
a
little
pale
malt
sweetness
but
i
get
pollen
and
cut
hay
and
ancient
harvest
vibes
from
the
yeast
its
got
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
flavor
bitterness
too
and
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
light
beers
ive
seen
the
way
the
yeast
has
so
completely
fermented
all
the
sugar
in
this
is
impressive
and
the
resulting
dry
snappy
mouthfeel
gives
this
beer
unrivaled
drinkability
full
flavored
for
the
color
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
of
this
yeast
for
my
own
brewing
pursuits
top
quality
brew
here
the
americans
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
consistently
make
beer
this
good
in
this
style
westy
blonde
is
a
topnotch
bpa
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
relatively
light
beer
certainly
among
the
top
examples
of
the
style
overall
amazing
aroma
and
flavors
very
enjoyable
and
complex
for
a
relatively
light
abv
o
this
is
stellar
for
the
session
brew
that
its
meant
to
be
o
not
what
i
expected
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
but
i
really
liked
it
very
complex
in
a
subtle
way
throw
your
expectations
to
the
wind
and
just
role
with
it
let
the
little
monk
beer
do
little
monk
beer
things
to
your
palette
and
enjoy
the
ride
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
is
it
possible
that
westvleteren
blonde
is
overlooked
this
is
simply
an
outstanding
blonde
which
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
receive
the
same
kind
of
love
as
its
siblings
if
youre
at
in
de
vrede
you
want
to
start
your
engine
with
this
on
first
trip
to
belgium
in
late
2010
a
road
trip
from
bruges
to
the
cafe
next
to
the
monastery
on
a
pilgrimage
for
the
quadruple
but
lets
start
with
the
blond
first
appearance
is
cloudy
with
a
light
foam
looks
like
an
unfiltered
wheat
aromas
of
wheat
with
an
estery
banana
note
taste
is
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
of
wheat
and
a
hop
end
note
mouthfeel
is
complex
and
rich
for
a
low
alcohol
beer
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
super
drinkable
beer
overall
what
a
pleasure
a
wellmade
brew
for
such
a
soft
style
as
others
of
said
drink
this
as
fresh
as
you
can
get
it
overshadowed
by
its
bigger
brothers
but
a
beer
that
should
not
be
overlooked
wish
i
could
get
more
for
it
would
make
a
great
table
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
either
smell
is
of
malt
honey
grape
juice
and
lots
of
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
earthy
spice
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
some
very
nice
flavors
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
touch
of
haze
nice
foamy
white
head
a
good
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
some
grass
a
little
mustiness
something
like
honey
the
taste
is
funky
up
front
but
mildly
so
its
grassy
and
biscuity
in
the
middle
with
a
nice
sharp
tang
at
the
end
its
moderately
carbonated
with
a
full
body
for
a
blonde
beer
all
in
all
very
nice
a
lot
like
orval
but
a
little
brighter
i
had
three
of
these
and
now
theyre
gone
wish
i
had
another
poured
from
a
bottle
at
beer
temple
in
amsterdam
to
a
chalice
glass
quarter
inch
of
white
lacing
that
dissipates
in
time
golden
color
bits
of
carbonation
hanging
in
the
glass
frothing
hundred
of
stagnant
bubbles
slightly
sweet
honey
smell
other

typical
to

overall

balanced
and
a
general
pleasure
to
drink
i
could
quaff
this
all
day
and
not
get
bored
o
one
of
the
finest
blonde
ales
ive
had
the
enjoyment
of
trying
this
is
an
enjoyable

thats
flavorful
refreshing
and
smooth
without
any
taking
away
from
the
other
overall
very
good
the
focus
on
the
yeast
really
improves
what
seems
to
me
to
otherwise
be
a
straightforward
but
high
quality
belgian
pale
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
just
an
allaround
great
beer
drink
it
fresh
though
as
that
is
when
it
is
most
enjoyable
has
subtle
mild
sweetness
and
is
very
crackery
a
little
bit
of
light
fruit
and
lemon
rind
is
present
but
more
prevalent
is
the
spicy
character
lots
of
earthy
grassy
hops
hit
the
palate
with
some
bitterness
present
finish
is
dry
and
a
touch
peppery
a
solid
albeit
unspectacular

pale

again
a
very
nice
beer
worth
seeking
out
poured
from
bottle
at
the
cafe
across
the
street
from
the
abbey
on
9812
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
bit
of
white
head
really
nice
yeasty
floral
aromas
some
citrus
taste
is
smooth
citrusy
yeasty
and
slight
hop
finish
its
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
and
feels
bigger
than
5
8
but
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
dissapointingly
not
the
best
i
ever
had
but
amazing
nonetheless
well
worth
a
visit
brace
yourselves
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
of
the
westvletern
line
even
though
it
says
blond
on
the
cap
to
me
this
tastes
like
an
excellent
tripel
it
has
all
the
lemony
hammy
salty
characteristics
but
at
a
lower
abv
that
doesnt
leave
much
of
a
burn
behind
nice
foggyyellow
color
and
the
light
fizz
is
a
bonus
too
plus
it
has
i
say
this
in
a
good
way
the
aroma
of
murphys
oil
soap
admit
it
you
too
inhale
deeply
when
when
you
open
the
murphys
bottle
save
the
cap
attach
a
magnet
to
it
and
put
it
on
the
fridge
as
a
memento
who
would
have
thought
that
westvleteren
could
make
an
interesting
beer
this
is
easily
one
of
the
most
straightup
belgian
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
so
much
yeast
the
pale
malts
can
barely
handle
the
yeast
explosion
but
it
works
and
im
happy
i
could
try
this
overall
this
is
singlehandedly
the
most
belgian
beer
ive
ever
tasted
unrelenting
and
intense
even
though
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
really
shows
how
you
craft
it
crazy
flavor
but
nice
and
drinkable
i
reviewed
it
for
what
it
is
as
i
always
do
hench
the
high
notes
i
might
still
prefer
a
dark
ale
with
a
4
this
is
simply
classic
belgian
blonde
ale
executed
perfectly
the
smell
is
light
and
faintly
hoppy
and
funky
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
slightly
bitter
slightly
sour
and
slightly
funky
as
well
there
beers
not
spicy
but
there
is
a
note
of
lemon
or
orange
zest
theres
also
a
distinct
suggestion
of
sweetness
in
the
brew
but
no
detectable
residual
sugar
like
a
really
awesome
leffe
blonde
finishes
perfectly
dry
and
leaves
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
lips
combined
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
most
supremely
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
tasted
not
the
best
but
quite
likely
the
best
in
its
genre
o
great
flavor
profile
and
incredibly
drinkable
could
sit
back
and
relax
with
this
beer
all
night
a
long
time
want
happy
to
have
five
more
had
on
tap
at
the
trappist
pour
is
a
bright
golden
orange
with
yellow
edges
the
head
is
creamy
white
leaving
a
thick
lace
the
nose
has
a
subtle
yeast
light
spice
lots
of
lemon
zest
and
light
floral
hop
in
the
back
the
taste
has
a
faint
spice
lots
of
yeast
lemon
zest
and
some
juicy
orange
cirtrus
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
body
is
light
and
refreshing
a
bit
juicy
and
prickly
carbonation
great
beer
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
very
enjoyable
overall
a
very
different
blonde
ale
with
less
sweet
fruitiness
than
you
often
get
this
one
is
complex
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
and
begs
to
be
consumed
in
quantity
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
the
balance
and
complexities
and
the
dry
yet
frothiness
of
the
mouthfeel
were
blended
perfectly
this
trappistry
truly
makes
worldclass
beers
the
glass
arrives
with
a
thick
white
head
a
cloudy
golden
color
it
has
a
delicately
perfumed
floral
aroma
with
secondary
aromas
of
spicy
earthy
hops
it
has
a
subtle
floral
taste
which
is
slightly
soapy
but
not
unpleasantly
its
slightly
sweet
and
spicy
the
body
is
light
and
it
lingers
nicely
but
not
excessively
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
quite
delicious
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
a
light
and
refreshing
westy
nice
but
no
12
or
8
overall
an
interesting
blonde
with
a
unique
aroma
for
the
style
quite
musty
yet
hoppy
and
dry
offers
a
nice
subtle
carbonation
and
effervescence
without
being
too
boisterous
on
the
pour
a
bit
untraditional
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
beautifully
and
stays
wonderful
from
there
big
fan
o
simply
this
is
the
best
blonde
i
have
ever
had
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
properly
store
and
enjoy
at
the
appropriate
temperature
o
good
drinking
beer
and
a
very
refreshing
beer

d
this
would
have
a
shot
at
a
perfect
beer
if
it
tasted
more
like
it
smelled
in
any
case
glad
i
got
to
try
it
cheers
notes
i
wish
it
werent
so
hard
to
get
in
the
us
not
the
12
but
a
really
enjoyable
drink
if
i
had
to
compare
to
another
trappist
i
would
say
it
is
closest
to
orval
will
try
my
second
bottle
in
about
6
months
at
in
de
vrede
white
fluffy
head
medium
retention
cloudy
golden
body
soapy
sticky
lacing
some
suspended
particles
fruity
aroma
mainly
old
banana
and
a
belgian
yeast
tasted
mainly
of
light
banana
candi
sugar
no
alcohol
noted
smooth
delicious
wish
it
was
not
so
hard
to
get
not
my
favorite
of
the
trappiste
but
fortunately
i
have
tried
others
from
w
split
one
with
my
battle
buddy
in
pint
glasses
loved
the
immense
milky
white
head
and
the
large
amount
of
floating
sediment
and
the
golden
color
the
smell
was
okay
but
not
really
spectacular
i
really
didnt
smell
much
from
it
a
bit
grassy
and
fruity
but
nothing
overly
compelling
taste
was
somewhat
sour
and
citrusy
unfortunately
we
compared
it
to
drinking
orange
juice
in
a
milk
glass
the
bitterness
was
fine
but
something
was
not
quite
right
this
was
purchased
from
a
specialty
shop
and
could
not
find
a
best
before
date
and
that
could
be
the
problem
not
a
bad
experience
but
i
was
hoping
for
better
fr
this
buxom
blonde
overall
not
my
best
trappiste
experience
but
might
try
againsithsome
assurance
of
freshness
as
i
see
better
opinions
by
others
o
a
good
and
easy
to
drink
blonde
but
not
my
favorite
though
a
really
outstanding
pale
ale
what
an
awesome
gift
my
friend
said
his
uncle
prefers
champagne
because
they
get
so
much
beer
he
is
tired
of
it
overall
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
well
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
youre
going
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
tracking
down
its
older
brothers
beer
is
medium
bodied
throughout
with
slightly
high
carbonation
levels
initially
over
time
fading
to
a
fairly
mildfeeling
carbonation
leading
to
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
finish
has
tannins
and
enough
hop
elements
to
be
quite
dry
notes
hmmm
maybe
the
least
sought
after
of
the
westvleteren
brews
but
this
is
quite
stellar
a
bit
orvalesque
in
the
initial
memory
if
this
were
not
so
scarce
and
pricey
id
love
to
have
plenty
handy
o
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
perfect
with
my
dinner
a
beer
that
is
better
than
the
desciption
as
there
is
nothing
that
jumps
out
at
you
but
it
all
works
so
wonderfully
together
still
overall
very
good
more
drinkable
than
duvel
and
the
like
due
to
low
alcohol
found
this
hiding
in
my
beer
cellar
had
totally
forgotten
that
i
had
picked
up
some
blonde
during
my
last
visit
to
the
abbey
clear
fizzy
light
yellow
pour
with
a
gorgeous
meringuelike
two
finger
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
grassy
herbal
yeasty
sour
nose
with
a
distinct
barnyard
odor
and
just
a
touch
of
lemon
the
taste
is
totally
belgian
grassy
spicy
hoppiness
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
specifically
lemon
and
just
a
hint
of
yeasty
bread
and
absolutely
no
sweetness
and
none
of
the
sourness
that
was
so
present
in
the
nose
crisp
smooth
and
dry
as
a
bone
but
oh
so
refreshing
the
balance
is
perfect
this
is
as
close
to
the
perfect
belgian
blonde
as
it
gets
im
not
big
into
belgian
pale
ales
but
this
stands
out
from
the
pack
perhaps
my
next
beer
run
to
the
abbey
will
be
for
a
couple
of
cases
of
blonde
o
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbonation
dry
upfront
and
grassy
hoppy
aftertaste
well
not
much
more
to
say
about
a
beer
produced
by
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
the
world
o
very
well
crafte
and
delicate
beer
this
really
is
a
classy
beer
nothing
outrageous
in
terms
of
flavor
but
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
this
really
gets
my
approval
o
an
outstanding
beer
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
its
very
delicious
this
is
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
run
into
in
belgium
so
far
but
well
see
how
long
that
lasts
as
ive
got
a
bottle
of
the
8
sitting
right
next
to
me
just
about
perfect
where
do
they
sell
the
kegs
this
would
be
the
ideal
beer
to
have
on
tap
in
home
get
it
done
darthkostrizer
overall
this
beer
was
worth
every
cent
of
the
25
bucks
i
paid
for
it
it
doesnt
taste
like
other
pale
ales
even
the
belgian
kind
and
thats
a
compliment
overall
with
this
beer
being
2
5
years
past
its
best
buy
date
it
is
still
a
really
good
beer
which
is
a
testament
to
how
good
a
beer
this
really
is
fresh
overall
another
fine
beer
from
the
abbey
i
have
tried
the
8
12
and
now
the
blonde
i
definitely
enjoy
the
8
and
the
12
significantly
more
than
the
blonde
but
that
is
at
least
in
part
due
to
the
fact
that
i
enjoy
quads
and
dubbels
more
than
i
do
belgian
pale
ales
in
general
still
i
am
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
definitely
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
the
style
i
wish
i
had
brought
back
two
or
three
more
bottles
so
i
could
continue
drinking
this
through
the
night
and
write
an
essay
on
it
i
still
have
the
8
and
12
to
try
and
my
god
this
thing
has
set
the
bar
quite
high
cant
wait
for
those
hazed
sunflower
gold
with
an
ivory
meringue
white
head
that
retains
fairly
well
on
the
nose
there
are
pumpkin
seeds
roses
carnations
coriander
and
lemon
with
an
unexpected
tropical
undercurrent
of
pineapple
passion
fruit
and
papaya
thats
matched
kinda
weirdly
with
a
musty
cellarfermenting
dough
character
the
flavor
is
all
fruit
punch
and
mimosa
reeling
with
pineapple
orange
kiwi
and
banana
with
hints
of
apricot
and
mirabelle
and
coriander
dandelion
and
yeast
around
the
edges
i
think
i
detect
something
fennelish
as
well
and
some
sweet
cashew
nuttiness
the
texture
is
spoton
for
the
flavor
light
and
soft
and
cloudlike
but
not
insipid
or
thin
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
pale
ale
as
you
might
expect
from
a
brewery
of
such
stature
def
worth
seeking
out
i
think
i
prefer
this
to
the
quad
o
this
is
the
antiamerican
belgian
pa
for
sure
and
to
my
mind
and
tastes
its
infinitely
more
drinkable
than
anything
that
american
produces
also
the
taste
of
this
was
just
really
great
even
after
my
palate
was
quote
unquote
tainted
by
my
12
it
was
very
smooth
and
crisp
definitely
a
beer
i
would
crave
after
a
long
day
of
work
very
refreshing
o
my
expectations
were
high
and
still
not
high
enough
o
what
more
can
one
say
never
had
a
better
beer
american
pale
ales
are
either
too
sweet
or
too
abrasively
hopped
or
not
interesting
enough
belgians
are
too
boozy
or
also
too
sweet
i
dont
like
sweet
things
so
the
citrus
provides
a
perfect
refreshing
replacement
for
sugariness
i
love
hops
but
have
never
had
a
beer
this
light
refreshing
and
balanced
with
enough
hoppiness
drinking
this
made
my
eyes
water
like
when
i
read
a
great
poem
or
see
one
of
my
favorite
paintings
in
person
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
another
blonde
this
good
well
worth
every
penny
overhyped
due
to
its
rarity
of
course
deserving
of
its
fame
you
bet
had
the
pleasure
of
traveling
to
the
westvletern
brewery
and
had
a
glass
of
this
at
in
dre
verde
the
monks
tiny
restaurant
and
bar
this
was
by
far
the
sexiest
blonde
ive
ever
seen
in
a
glass
it
was
very
cloudy
and
had
a
beautiful
head
and
just
from
looking
at
it
i
could
tell
that
it
would
be
delicious
not
only
was
this
beer
rich
and
complex
but
it
was
smooth
as
hell
too
it
really
flowed
down
my
throat
and
i
was
pleasently
surprised
by
the
least
known
of
the
three
offerings
from
this
magical
brewery
cant
wait
to
try
the
bottle
i
brought
home
thanks
to
denise
for
the
surprise
box
from
belgium
what
a
treat
very
clean
crisp
dry
ale
refreshing
if
nothing
else
unfortunately
that
was
the
last
of
the
westy
blondes
onto
the
8s
and
12s
i
guess
this
beer
isnt
the
best
ive
ever
tried
but
i
have
the
8
and
12
waiting
so
its
a
great
first
taste
of
westvleteren
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
yeasty
dryness
in
the
taste
quite
yeasty
and
refreshing
with
a
small
dry
hop
in
the
end
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
hop
in
the
aftertaste
nice
hops
in
a
blonde
and
nice
body
too
d
great
depth
of
character
in
nose
and
palate
than
expected
smooth
creaminess
with
a
solid
refreshing
semi
dry
finish
makes
it
very
refreshing
overall
a
superb
complexity
age
has
definitely
not
harmed
it
excellent
cellaring
no
doubt
aided
this
a
decent
balanced
beer
but
its
nothing
special
ive
had
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
o
perfect
beer
what
is
there
to
say
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
belgian
beers
i
have
had
so
far
i
am
shocked
what
the
8
and
12
taste
like
and
cant
wait
to
experience
them
the
listed
5
8
abv
seems
small
as
the
beer
feels
much
bigger
this
is
one
incredibly
impressive
piece
of
work
o
not
worth
the
8
euros
i
paid
for
it
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
curious
about
the
other
two
o
pretty
epic
for
the
style
will
see
how
it
holds
up
with
age
do
drinkability
is
moderate
this
is
a
tricky
one
it
certainly
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
that
could
be
more
in
part
due
to
the
surprisingly
lack
of
boldness
in
the
nose
and
flavor
rather
than
an
eagerness
to
quaff
it
on
my
end
just
a
bit
too
bready
for
my
liking
and
certainly
doesnt
resonate
on
the
same
level
as
the
12
and
8
by
westvleteren
those
beers
are
world
class
and
unique
while
i
feel
this
beer
is
rather
pedestrian
and
even
moreso
considering
the
pedigree
behind
the
name
im
not
slamming
the
beers
score
just
based
on
who
brews
it
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
it
is
in
a
separate
realm
compared
to
the
12
and
8
maybe
a
fresher
bottle
would
preserve
some
of
those
flavors
better
but
as
it
stands
i
will
stick
to
the
other
two
westvleteren
beers
tastes
light
almost
flavourless
the
yeast
is
notable
some
light
lemon
and
citrus
flavours
not
the
fruit
but
rather
tastes
like
the
peels
a
bit
rough
and
bitter
carbonation
level
is
high
and
i
think
that
hurts
the
beer
imho
havent
had
many
belgian
pales
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
think
its
just
a
style
i
find
hard
to
enjoy
the
flavors
are
complex
and
separately
distinct
at
first
gulp
then
begins
the
harmonious
blending
and
mingling
resinous
belgian
hoppiness
citrus
rind
caramel
malt
and
spiced
rum
form
as
one
and
invite
large
gulps
and
noisy
lipsmacking
the
candi
sugar
sweetness
is
the
unifying
factor
here
its
central
in
all
the
outward
flavors
by
the
time
the
initial
effervescence
wears
down
and
the
ale
mellows
its
gone
and
you
wish
you
had
another
blondus
supremus
keith
im
indebted
to
you
for
picking
me
up
this
overall
i
think
i
may
have
a
bottle
past
its
prime
these
seemed
so
much
better
when
i
drank
it
at
in
de
vrede
ill
try
another
and
update
my
review
when
i
get
a
chance
this
is
an
awesome
blonde
ale
33
of
the
nonretired
westvleteren
beers
complete
without
a
doubt
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
summer
beer
and
my
favorite
representative
of
the
belgian
blond
style
it
couldnt
be
better
better
balanced
and
with
a
low
abv
and
crisp
carbonation
it
stays
tremendously
refreshing
i
could
easily
drink
one
after
the
other
a
wonderful
belgian
blond
one
of
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
while
it
doesnt
have
the
complexity
and
depth
of
flavour
of
the
other
westys
this
would
easily
be
my
pick
to
drink
regularly
lovely
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
so
drinkable
so
refreshing
personally
i
would
put
it
in
the
same
category
as
saissons
which
i
am
not
a
huge
lover
of
but
i
appreciate
their
crispness
and
drinkability
i
would
much
rather
have
westvleterens
other
offerings
over
the
blonde
and
would
go
as
far
to
say
that
other
belgian
blondes
offer
more
palatewise
than
westvleterens
did
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
easy
drinking
with
the
abv
hidden
exceptionally
well
much
more
hoppy
than
i
anticipated
this
is
among
the
most
hoppy
belgian
pales
i
have
had
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
experience
but
i
dont
think
it
is
worth
the
hassle
of
trying
to
secure
this
unless
the
opportunity
is
presented
to
you
within
reason
the
flavor
is
malty
with
some
light
dry
crackerlike
tinges
with
some
herbal
almost
bitter
flavored
with
strong
yeastiness
and
minty
element
from
the
hops
which
gives
a
nice
contrast
to
the
grassy
and
slight
fruity
yeast
the
malt
doesnt
taste
like
the
smell
leads
you
to
believe
it
will
just
basically
dry
and
the
yeast
adds
a
minor
pear
accent
to
the
mild
tannic
tinge
the
hops
create
the
yeast
and
hop
cohesion
is
very
pleasant
and
the
dry
essence
makes
this
a
nice
sipper
welcoming
additional
tastes
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
but
overall
it
was
not
what
i
expected
i
found
it
to
be
saisonlike
in
a
good
way
and
the
very
dry
malt
is
what
i
was
not
expecting
this
is
not
the
best
of
what
this
brewery
offers
but
it
has
a
high
drinkability
quotient
so
do
try
it
if
you
enjoy
saisons
or
hoppy
belgian
pale
ales
overall
great
beer
when
consumed
fresh
it
humiliates
all
others
in
the
style
what
a
beer
everything
is
how
it
should
be
jd
o
i
really
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
westy
really
simple
strait
forwardly
crafted
beer
with
high
quality
and
with
hi
drinkability
now
if
only
they
increased
their
market
o
while
the
not
the
overall
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
is
near
the
top
top
in
its
style
that
i
have
had
its
just
very
smooth
overall
and
very
drinkable
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
to
note
some
dark
fruits
in
this
beer
as
i
would
with
quadrupels
just
a
testament
to
the
genius
of
the
monks
of
the
st
sixtus
abbey
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
an
excellent
table
beer
for
this
time
of
year
i
just
wish
i
had
more
a
huge
thanks
to
my
best
friend
ryan
for
sherpaing
this
beer
back
to
the
usa
overall
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
to
pack
this
much
complexity
into
a
blonde
is
incredible
my
nose
and
mouth
were
all
over
the
place
trying
to
figure
everything
out
bottle
shared
at
the
may
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
lacy
white
ring
of
foam
aroma
is
phenolic
and
ashy
with
accents
of
pale
malts
and
yeast
kinda
cigarettey
in
a
way
flavor
is
much
better
dry
pale
malts
provide
a
nice
background
for
the
ludicrous
hop
bitterness
ive
had
less
bitter
ipas
this
is
awesome
perfect
hoppiness
for
a
belgian
golden
ale
so
so
dry
but
quenching
and
fulfilling
bitter
pale
and
delicious
the
rating
i
gave
it
reflects
my
review
of
this
beer
fresh
not
aged
i
think
its
meant
to
be
consumed
fresh
but
i
did
enjoy
it
with
2
years
of
age
on
it
this
is
the
underdog
of
westvleteren
beers
in
most
peoples
minds
but
i
had
all
three
side
by
side
and
this
one
impressed
me
most
with
its
complexity
ease
of
drinkability
and
allround
deliciousness
i
will
be
seeking
this
beer
out
over
westy
12
from
now
on
o
pretty
good
overall
fine
beer
o
such
a
stand
out
in
its
category
it
seriously
goes
above
and
beyond
any
blonde
ive
ever
tried
overall
only
downside
was
price
worth
it
for
the
experience
overall
drinkability
great
balance
best
blonde
ive
ever
had
no
offense
emily
i
maintain
that
high
alcohol
beers
are
comparatively
easier
to
make
than
low
alcohol
beers
at
5
8
this
is
a
very
low
alcohol
belgian
beer
but
it
has
a
fantastic
nose
great
mouthfeel
and
the
closest
thing
to
a
perfect
flavor
that
i
have
had
from
a
textbook
blonde
for
the
style
i
think
that
this
is
the
best
of
the
westvleteren
beers
it
was
by
far
the
highlight
of
the
trip
to
sint
sixtus
good
stuff
i
quite
like
it
comparable
to
an
orval
but
not
quite
the
complexity
d
quite
drinkable
considering
the
low
alcohol
content
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
bit
dry
to
drink
over
and
over
not
to
mention
its
not
the
easiest
beer
in
the
world
to
come
by
overall
i
am
into
big
beers
so
this
is
really
not
my
thing
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
tremendous
would
never
turn
down
a
glass
drinkability
and
overall
impression
each
sip
follows
the
last
quite
naturally
and
im
more
than
happy
to
have
more
i
certainly
would
drink
more
of
these
if
i
were
able
and
i
could
imagine
being
quite
happy
if
this
were
the
daily
beer
that
went
with
my
meals
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
first
rate
pale
ale
with
just
enough
belgian
yeast
character
to
differentiate
it
from
other
styles
of
pale
ale
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
one
inch
white
fluffy
head
looks
very
refreshing
smell
is
full
of
belgian
yeast
earthy
a
little
funky
and
maybe
a
slight
hop
character
taste
is
great
a
light
spice
character
earthy
yeast
a
lemon
fruitiness
but
without
the
sour
and
finishes
with
a
small
hoppy
bite
mouthfeel
is
excellent
for
such
a
light
beer
it
is
creamy
carbonation
is
perfect
and
finishes
crisp
and
clean
overall
this
beer
really
impresses
me
for
such
a
light
beer
it
is
so
well
crafted
its
ridiculous
if
it
was
easy
to
find
i
could
easily
go
through
a
sixer
in
a
session
during
the
summer
bravo
st
sixtus
o
overall
i
believe
that
this
beer
is
the
pioneer
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
leader
nonetheless
it
is
the
perfect
spring
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
to
drink
thanks
again

cheers
this
is
a
delightful
belgian
blond
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
at
5
8
md
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
but
crisp
beer
the
flavors
on
this
were
really
surprising
to
me
especially
the
hops
but
my
bottle
was
pretty
recent
so
i
assume
that
with
some
age
it
would
balance
out
a
little
more
but
i
loved
it
i
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head

lasted

nearly
flawless

a
hazy
straw
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
nose
has
light
fruity
malts
spicy
yeast
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
sourness
taste
definately
a
bit
tart
this
was
an
older
bottle
that
doesnt
seem
to
have
aged
very
well
poured

pale
yellow
with
a
finger

dense

some
sticky

spicing

dry
almost
parching

leaving
one
longing
for

great

drinks
exceptionally
subtle
and
sophisticated
d
with
the
light
body
tasty
flavors
crispness
and
low
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
only
wish
it
were
a
bit
easier
to
obtain
because
i
would
love
to
have
a
sixer
of
this
to
put
back
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
around
the
grill
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
delicious
and
very
drinkable
a
very
flavorful
bpa
i
could
drinks
these
all
day
perhaps
not
as
robust
as
their
stronger
counterparts
but
still
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
pours
a
pale
blond
slightly
hazy
but
quite
clear
really
small
white
head
traces
of
lace
show
up
on
the
glass
smells
slightly
spicy
mild
yeast
detectable
hop
presence
and
some
citrus
tastes
of
pale
malt
a
touch
of
yeast
quite
hoppy
i
found
solid
bitterness
and
at
some
points
faint
traces
of
alcohol
good
mouthfeel
medium
weight
understated
carbonation
very
drinkable
could
very
well
drink
this
all
night
good
stuff
and
not
at
like
what
i
thought
it
would
be
the
beer
poured
quite
cloudy
with
a
thick
white
head
it
is
strawcolored
and
hazy
with
ample
and
tenacious
lacing
the
nose
has
aromas
of
lemon
hay
and
the
yeast
the
flavor
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
good
hop
flavors
up
front
and
at
the
finish
and
a
doughy
yeasty
flavor
with
some
malt
character
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
lively
carbonation
pricking
through
the
finish
is
dry
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
had
to
force
myself
to
slow
down
and
savor
it
taste
is
right
on
target
its
a
bit
spicy
and
citrusy
with
some
tart
almost
funky
flavors
to
it
but
theyre
fairly
subtle
reminiscent
of
orval
mouthfeel
is
really
light
crisp
and
super
dry
on
the
finish
overall
super
well
done
easy
drinking
beer
im
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
try
this
fantastic
beer
d
i
actually
find
this
drinks
slightly
hard
for
a
5
8
but
tastes
good
enough
that
it
warrants
a
higher
than
average
drinkability
great
beer
i
use
to
think
this
needed
to
be
drunk
quickly
from
my
first
experience
but
my
impression
after
my
second
bottle
is
that
it
requires
about
a
year
standing
before
it
gains
its
appetising
maturity
and
composure
a
gentle
and
humane
beer
thanks
brad
really
beautiful
hazy
apricot
with
a
creamy
meringue
head
aroma
is
yeasty
with
an
impression
of
orange
and
lemon
pulp
and
some
really
soft
spices
interesting
yeast
interplay
is
the
first
thought
upon
sipping
kind
of
reminiscent
of
an
aged
de
dolle
offering
the
yeast
is
too
heavy
at
times
for
my
taste
soft
lemons
creep
around
but
cant
really
shine
through
the
yeast
theres
a
purity
and
freshness
to
this
brew
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
fruit
like
grapefruits
oranges
and
lemons
this
is
interesting
definitely
very
good
with
a
really
refreshing
quality
overall
i
got
the
blonde
8
and
12
together
and
i
wanted
to
drink
them
together
but
i
think
aging
this
one
9
months
was
a
real
mistake
id
love
to
have
a
fresh
one
because
i
dont
think
the
one
im
having
is
a
quality
clear
yellow
pour
with
a
gigantic
foamy
white
head
lemony
yeasty
aroma
with
a
slight
hint
of
bread
pepper
grass
and
spice
light
tart
fruits
and
citrus
make
most
of
the
body
of
the
flavor
with
a
slightly
sweet
yeasty
peppery
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
medium
body
dry
finish
and
lots
of
carbonation
i
usually
find
the
blond
styles
to
be
a
bit
boring
but
this
has
some
nice
layers
of
complexity
to
it
d
would
definitely
have
again
in
a
heartbeat
but
not
really
a
session
beer
unlike
any
other
belgian
blonde
ive
had
very
unique
pleased
ive
used
the
glass
at
last
and
the
lesser
of
the
brothers
beers
gets
a
thumbs
up
from
me
not
huge
scores
but
im
a
low
marker
compared
to
most
on
ba
drinks
well
would
be
better
in
the
springsummertime
but
works
ok
on
this
cold
blizzardy
night
d
it
doesnt
feel
heavy
at
all
so
you
could
certainly
have
several
without
a
problem
5
8
abv
i
learned
that
the
westvleteren
blonde
is
the
basic
beer
for
the
monks
own
consumption
since
1999
when
the
former
6
dark
ale
red
cap
was
finally
discarded
after
the
4
had
already
gone
that
path
i
had
the
westy
blonde
6
on
selfproclaimed
westy
day
010611
with
a
craft
beer
aficionado
first
prior
to
tasting
a
westy
8
and
then
a
12
this
beer
was
bottled
in
2008
with
date
19
10
11
stamped
on
cap
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
blonde
and
faint
bubbly
appearance
retained
nice
carbonation
throughout
this
is
an
unique
style
taste
buds
were
immediately
challenged
initially
turned
from
fire
to
ice
noticeably
tastes
better
from
cold
to
just
above
room
temperature
smell
was
wheaty
and
perhaps
hints
of
banana
for
a
blonde
beer
like
this
definitely
hit
the
top
of
my
palate
this
beer
left
nice
laces
throughout
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
in
the
summer
if
acquired
again
o
one
of
a
kind
brew
right
here
its
really
wonderful
and
just
makes
you
want
more
and
more
its
dryness
just
taunts
your
tongue
must
have
its
like
cookies
and
im
cookie
monster
medium
bodied
and
surprisingly
hop
forward
especially
since
this
bottle
has
been
aged
for
about
four
years
im
picking
up
the
zesty
peppery
spice
that
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
bready
yeast
and
fruit
notes
especially
apple
and
pear
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
evident
throughout
but
rather
than
overpowering
the
other
flavors
they
compliment
them
adding
complexity
and
balance
there
is
slight
alcohol
sweetness
and
heat
but
this
beer
is
still
incredibly
quaffable
ws
when
i
first
tried
this
i
immediately
wanted
a
bigger
drink
this
is
smooth
and
can
be
enjoyed
all
day
long
d
very
high
if
only
i
could
get
more
of
it
4s
all
the
way
across
really
solid
worth
a
try
very
mellow
and
musty
drinkability
wow
i
need
a
cigarette
after
wrestling
a
beer
like
this
this
is
as
fine
an
example
of
this
style
as
ive
ever
had
the
complexity
of
tastes
and
smells
it
amazing
when
i
first
sipped
this
beer
there
was
literally
a
sensory
overload
as
thousands
of
flavors
flashed
into
my
brain
at
the
same
time
if
my
life
were
a
flavor
profile
then
my
life
definitely
flashed
before
my
eyes
with
this
impressive
beer
d
what
a
great
beer
im
so
glad
to
have
tried
it
highly
recommended
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
pale
ale
while
not
usually
my
favorite
style
i
thought
this
beer
smelt
great
and
was
very
complex
i
also
felt
like
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
felt
like
i
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
down
and
would
actually
want
to
taste
was
good
but
pretty
standard
heavy
on
the
spices
would
definitely
have
again
and
glad
i
got
to
try
a
bottle
perfect
balance
this
is
delicious
and
light
feeling
it
reminds
me
of
a
mikkeller
that
was
refined
further
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
nice
white
head
smell
is
quite
fruity
but
also
has
a
grassy
edge
to
it
quite
a
complex
smell
that
i
really
cant
describe
it
flavour
is
really
nice
small
bitterness
but
lots
of
sweetness
and
the
belgian
flavours
come
through
very
dry
finish
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
have
no
idea
how
they
packed
that
much
complexity
under
6
abv
pours
a
light
creamy
blonde
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
quite
complex
with
notes
of
light
fruits
citrus
peel
hops
and
a
bit
of
bready
dough
taste
is
quite
similar
with
some
of
the
drier
white
stone
fruits
taking
over
a
little
bit
and
fading
into
a
nice
hoppy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
dry
finish
excellent
drinkability
can
only
dream
of
sitting
in
belgium
drinking
a
few
of
these
while
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
does
not
live
up
to
the
8
or
12
i
think
id
rather
have
a
taras
boulba
appears
pale
straw
with
a
huge
white
foam
head
it
is
the
color
of
white
grapes
pale
malts
make
up
a
majority
of
the
aroma
but
there
is
also
some
yeast
notes
the
taste
begins
malty
sweet
but
with
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
finish
along
with
a
does
of
spices
it
is
dry
and
champagne
like
it
is
easy
drinking
but
the
amount
of
spices
may
be
a
bit
much
this
beer
gets
less
respect
than
the
stronger
offerings
from
this
brewery
but
it
is
still
a
solid
beverage
d
ya
id
take
another
i
wouldnt
trade
much
to
get
this
one
but
it
was
definitely
enjoyable
i
could
session
this
beer
for
criminys
sake
multiple
bottles
this
one
was
a
gusher
pours
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
and
good
lacing
left
by
the
collapsing
head
clear
golden
body
speckled
with
small
yeasties
aroma
of
corn
corn
nuts
astringent
malt
alcohol
citrus
zest
spices
and
pepper
taste
is
astringent
malt
and
spices
corn
nuts
with
a
lot
of
barely
fizzy
and
astringent
mouthfeel
not
very
impressed
to
be
perfectly
honest
tried
the
blond
5
8at
their
in
de
vrede
cafe
last
week
served
from
bottle
to
goblet
hazy
light
yellow
color
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
generous
lacing
down
the
glass
yeasty
earthy
farmhouse
aroma
very
clean
and
inviting
smelling
clean
dry
bitter
taste
that
leaves
a
light
buttery
coating
in
your
mouth
not
complicated
but
enjoyable
good
beer
nothing
like
westy
12
this
is
a
good
pale
solidly
reps
the
style
pours
slighty
cloudy
and
gold
with
two
fingers
of
head
which
reduces
to
about
a
half
and
sticks
around
the
top
smell
is
the
hops
with
the
yeast
underneath
after
that
i
can
smell
some
type
of
spice
that
i
cannot
describe
but
reminds
me
of
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
slight
carbonation
and
slight
foam
and
very
little
trace
of
alcohol
the
first
taste
is
very
similar
and
clean
the
second
is
the
same
but
i
remember
the
hops
and
im
very
impressed
i
wish
i
could
better
describe
what
i
taste
but
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
everyday
it
was
a
hard
birthday
present
to
get
but
worth
it
notes
really
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
before
reviewing
it
so
i
wouldnt
be
tainted
by
others
opinions
brett
is
awesome
in
blondes
and
so
is
this
high
level
of
hopping
amazing
reviewing
my
notes
prompted
me
to
check
airlines
prices
you
know
just
in
case
d
i
think
i
might
actually
like
this
aged
version
better
than
the
fresh
ones
that
i
have
tried
a
really
big
difference
in
terms
of
flavor
and
a
beer
that
you
generally
would
not
recommend
cellaring
for
this
long
but
i
think
it
worked
very
nicely
drinkability
very
good
beer
in
the
style
trappist
despite
its
relative
lightness
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
a
legendary
brewery
i
will
admit
bpas
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
a
drinkable
example
d
this
would
be
a
brilliant
summemr
beer
if
it
wouldnt
be
for
how
damn
hard
it
is
to
get
perfectly
drinkable
d
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
it
would
be
wonderful
for
breakfast
with
steamed
mussels
too
goes
down
easily
and
begs
to
be
drank
d
highly
no
question
about
that
4
5
if
you
can
get
a
bottle
this
beer
is
worth
it
its
both
unique
and
incredible
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
was
a
great
summer
refresher
after
a
hot
day
out
under
the
sun
a
tad
hoppier
than
expected
but
by
no
means
a
complaint
great
stuff
i
am
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
try
this
notes
best
before
060810
enjoyable
beer
that
was
light
and
refreshing
the
taste
was
a
touch
too
thinlight
for
my
liking
but
i
think
some
of
that
may
have
been
due
to
the
age
which
wasnt
the
freshest
but
it
wasnt
too
old
either
i
would
really
like
to
try
one
of
these
really
fresh
overall
a
solid
beer
and
very
good
example
of
the
style
wonderful
smelling
and
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
it
gets
overshadowed
by
the
other
two
but
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
this
one
definitely
give
it
a
try

beer
the
best
belgian
pale
i
remember
having
as
i
look
through
my
reviews
it
blows
away
my
other
belgian
pale
and
belgian
strong
pale
scores
i
am
sure
that
i
will
be
much
happier
in
a
week
or
2
with
the
westy
12
that
is
sitting
in
my
basement
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
well
worth
seeking
out
my
bottle
may
have
been
aged
a
bit
longer
than
optimal
but
the
additional
research
to
confirmdeny
this
another
belgium
visit
will
have
to
wait
for
the
time
being
this
is
a
great
beer
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
very
complex
and
it
seems
that
i
detect
something
different
each
time
i
take
another
sip
it
is
drinkable
to
boot
making
me
wish
i
lived
next
to
saint
sixtus

alas
i
do
not
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
visibly
effervescent
with
a
huge
stiff
white
crown
that
decomposes
in
3d
like
and
ice
cream
sundae
with
sheets
of
belgian
lacing
a
pretty
nice
show
the
smell
is
bright
earthy
lemon
grassy
hop
adorned
nicely
with
a
touch
of
spices
the
carbonation
brightens
up
the
thin
texture
of
the
mouth
feel
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
flavor
is
on
the
lighter
side
as
well
earthy
and
bright
but
slightly
understated
a
real
easy
drinker
im
really
glad
that
i
got
the
opportunity
to
consider
this
one
many
thanks
to
shadesofgray
d
goes
down
really
smooth
and
easy
nothing
overbearing
about
it
quite
refreshing
as
well
d
good
light
crisp
would
be
a
great
summer
brew
but
is
just
a
little
too
mild
for
me
especially
considering
its
geological
rarity
taste
is
of
clove
lemon
orange
peel
hops
belgian
yeast
and
some
biscuit
notes
the
beer
is
dry
throughout
which
adds
to
the
complexity
and
drinkability
in
my
opinion
compared
to
other
blondes
ive
had
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
session
beers
and
also
satisfies
my
hops
craving
i
tried
and
tried
but
my
nose
couldnt
detect
any
smell
i
would
say
its
a
flat
beer
but
very
enjoyable
to
drink
i
will
save
the
rest
for
spring
when
the
temperatures
will
rise
pours
cloudy
pale
copper
aroma
is
earthy
some
bretty
yeast
pineapple
grapefruit
flavors
of
light
lemon
canned
peaches
slight
acidity
and
bitterness
on
a
the
dry
and
slightly
cloveish
finish
with
a
bit
of
tanginess
as
well
a
fine
beer
but
dont
let
it
take
the
place
of
a
12
or
8
if
you
can
get
any
of
them
overrated
overpriced
and
nowhere
close
to
orval
d
its
the
session
beer
of
the
westvleteren
monks
if
its
good
enough
for
them
its
good
enough
for
me
ill
always
have
fond
memories
of
sipping
this
with
urbain
bryna
and
dave
schuster
at
cafe
in
de
vrede
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
soft
yellow
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
a
bit
understated
but
prominent
notes
of
yeast
and
citrus
are
still
easy
to
notice
the
flavor
is
bright
and
cheerful
yet
earthy
the
lemony
citrus
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
tongue
followed
by
a
mild
undercurrent
of
yeasty
twang
and
a
finale
of
dry
sweetness
the
texture
is
the
star
more
than
anything
though
with
an
initial
effervescent
punch
to
the
tip
of
the
tongue
that
somehow
seems
to
disappear
into
an
unexpected
smoothness
as
the
liquid
explored
my
mouth
it
finishes
dry
and
clean
but
the
result
is
lightandairy
rather
than
crispandrefreshing
certainly
not
the
most
flavorful
selection
but
a
terrific
drinking
experience
given
the
demand
of
the
8
12
i
would
suggest
you
dont
overlook
this
one
i
really
liked
it
and
everyone
thought
this
one
was
great
i
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
and
not
as
an
afterthought
to
the
12
it
stands
on
its
own
pours
a
pale
hazy
gold
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
leaves
a
nice
looking
lace
smells
of
yeast
lemons
apples
hay
and
cloves
the
taste
is
mostly
lemon
yeast
and
grass
mildly
sweet
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
effervescent
a
crisp
beer
which
finishes
dry
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
toasted
malts
are
obvious
up
front
fruit
is
lighter
than
i
expected
apple
again
grapefruit
maybe
picking
up
a
sweetness
like
honey
of
course
the
common
belgian
yeasts
finally
finishing
on
the
slightly
bitter
side
very
well
balanced
and
crisp

this
is
a
very
nice
beer
interesting
quite
tasty
a
little
more
herbalgrass
than
id
prefer
very
glad
i
had
it
probably
not
going
to
the
measures
necessary
to
have
too
many
more
still
absolutely
worth
having
i
adore
this
beer
it
was
for
better
or
for
worse
the
only
beer
that
the
shop
across
from
the
abbey
in
westvleteren
had
for
retail
the
last
time
i
was
there
this
is
in
my
opinion
a
quintessential
belgian
pale
ale
yeasty
funk
dry
bitterness
and
tartness
hoppy
but
in
proportion
and
ohsorefreshing
i
would
drink
this
very
frequently
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
this
side
of
the
pond
not
a
common
brew
but
if
you
get
a
chance
to
sample
this
gem
i
highly
recommend
you
do
so
d
i
would
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
for
the
summer
just
a
really
great
beer
all
around
thanks
again
mikesgroove
t
if
you
were
to
give
me
this
beer
in
a
blilnd
taste
test
i
would
swear
it
is
part
belgian
blonde
part
french
cider
the
apple
and
clove
flavors
really
come
through
strong
and
it
tastes
wonderful
this
is
a
very
unique
and
well
crafted
beer
i
would
expect
nothing
less
of
westvleteren
i
could
drink
this
beer
every
day
and
not
get
tired
of
it
its
so
tasty
and
drinkable
aroma
had
a
strong
corn
flake
malt
presence
and
contained
some
expected
fruit
notes
of
pear
honeydew
melon
lemon
zest
star
fruit
and
honey
and
some
surprisingly
nice
spicy
hop
character
that
smelled
distinctly
of
white
pepper
and
tobacco
smoke
this
smoke
would
come
through
in
the
finish
of
the
flavor
as
well
the
majority
of
the
body
tastes
of
fruity
yeast
pear
and
apricot
mostly
and
some
sweet
bready
grain
doughy
feel
from
all
the
yeast
sediment
but
the
carbonation
does
add
some
levity
certainly
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
surprsing
good
and
this
is
very
drinkable
cloudy
golden
yellow
thick
white
head
malt
aroma
with
lemon
and
white
pepper
lightly
spiced
maybe
coriander
maybe
orange
peel
with
sourness
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
nicely
balanced
and
very
complex
start
with
this
one
before
heading
to
the
12
a
unique
brew
d
a
first
class
easygoing
beer
very
flavorful
considering
the
style
and
strength
reminds
me
a
lot
of
duvel
only
less
sweet
still
super
smooth
but
just
a
bitter
excellent
brew
drinkability
but
for
the
difficulty
of
acquiring
this
beer
it
would
be
monstrously
sessionable
i
love
it
d
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
although
not
as
complex
as
i
had
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
incredible
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
purchased
this
beer
with
a
10
and
12
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
delirium
tremens
glass
thick
white
head
that
dominates
the
beer
the
beer
is
yellow
and
cloudy
the
aroma
is
subtle
but
good
smells
like
a
blonde
ale
some
alcohol
mostly
malt
no
hop
character
the
taste
is
sour
mouthfeel
is
full
and
good
the
beer
fills
your
mouth
it
is
incredible
the
head
falls
away
as
you
drink
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
my
tour
of
trappist
ales
should
result
in
me
being
able
to
rank
them
right
now
this
one
is
the
in
the
lead
i
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
in
the
us
or
available
at
all
well
see
how
the
others
hold
up
overall
yes
this
is
a
good
beer
yes
its
westvleteren
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
out
mfd
the
feel
is
absolutely
amazing
the
head
is
thick
and
creamy
like
a
nitro
head
the
body
itself
is
a
bit
too
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
almost
crisp
enough
the
carbonation
is
ample
it
just
doesnt
bite
through
hard
enough
for
me
needless
to
say
i
would
gladly
have
another
or
a
whole
sixer
by
myself
very
murky
pale
yellow
with
a
towering
3
finger
head
that
camps
out
for
a
while
in
all
of
its
fluffy
goodness
smell
is
clove
light
tropical
fruit
and
a
light
graininess
taste
is
dominated
by
spices
but
they
arent
very
bold
on
the
palate
subtle
and
inviting
unfortunately
it
is
a
tad
watery
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
make
it
interesting
medium
bodied
with
a
stinging
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
session
type
beer
but
it
is
not
worth
the
price
tag
that
it
takes
to
get
it
in
america
notes
of
course
i
looked
forward
to
having
this
beer
i
was
able
to
purchase
12
and
8
online
but
this
one
was
not
available
at
the
time
of
my
purchase
at
or
near
the
brewery
but
to
actually
try
it
was
sublime
as
i
repeated
my
sips
i
thought
to
myself
that
god
himself
must
have
had
a
hand
in
the
decisions
that
went
into
these
beers
as
they
are
divine
i
strongly
believe
that
the
blonde
is
underrated
overall
a
good
brew
everything
was
very
much
to
my
tastes
for
a
blond
except
for
the
thinner
and
weaker
palate
unfortunately
this
one
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
superior
and
outerworldly
westvleteren
8
but
one
worth
checking
out
in
its
own
right
though
with
the
hefty
price
tag
this
one
accompanies
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
fairly
unimpressive
overall
it
started
out
great
and
full
of
promise
but
failed
to
deliver
drinkability
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
average
to
high
but
the
mellow
flavors
and
the
availability
make
me
seek
other
blonds
to
satiate
my
palates
desires
lightbodied
rather
fizzy
and
somewhat
watery
feel
for
a
belgian
of
this
apparent
caliber
short
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
really
is
what
turned
me
off
of
this
beer
the
monks
know
d
a
great
beer
too
bad
this
beer
is
nearly
impossible
to
find
or
it
would
be
a
regular
it
disappeared
far
too
fast
after
popping
the
cap
on
this
we
had
kind
of
a
gusher
poured
into
a
glass
with
a
big
whitehead
a
golden
orange
color
and
the
familiar
haze
of
yeast
this
beer
has
a
great
complex
nose
notes
of
fruit
spice
and
yeast
after
the
nose
i
expected
this
to
be
a
heavier
beer
in
taste
then
it
is
it
was
quite
light
and
clean
and
crisp
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
love
to
sit
at
the
local
pub
and
enjoy
several
pints
of
definitely
the
lightest
and
most
refreshing
of
the
three
and
not
to
be
passed
over
the
taste
was
great
butter
smooth
the
yeast
plays
a
huge
role
in
the
flavor
nice
tight
dry
finish
its
great
so
easy
to
drink
its
an
outstanding
beer
but
sadly
not
worth
the
trouble
to
retrieve
for
most
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
this
beer
with
the
westy
8
and
12
and
im
very
happy
i
was
able
to
try
it
a
damn
fine
brew
33cl
bottle
with
the
signature
ring
around
the
neck
green
cap
thanks
to
alen
for
the
trade
i
was
told
this
bottle
recently
came
from
the
source
in
belgium
so
it
is
a
fresh
sample
for
what
its
worth
beautiful
golden
hue
slightly
yeasty
after
the
second
pour
large
sticky
white
head
lasting
a
while
smell
is
all
soft
honey
and
milk
with
a
nice
bit
of
yeasty
bread
and
a
good
bit
of
dry
herbal
hop
bouquet
in
there
this
is
phenomenal
wow
i
really
didnt
expect
this
to
be
so
hoppy
i
assumed
it
would
be
more
blonde
as
the
name
implies
but
i
guess
i
didnt
notice
that
it
was
categorized
as
a
belgian
pale
while
it
does
share
an
excellent
crispness
and
pale
malt
with
something
like
a
blonde
german
lager
it
also
has
a
great
dry
bitter
spicy
and
herbal
hop
profile
really
great
and
unexpected
so
subtly
complex
but
what
makes
this
beer
great
is
that
its
just
so
simple
and
tasty
delicious
smooth
substantial
and
crisp
on
the
palate
utterly
quenching
and
refreshing
i
will
have
to
go
to
belgium
one
day
and
drink
many
of
these
one
is
not
hardly
enough
to
quote
my
lady
this
beer
is
beyond
awesome
never
in
a
million
years
did
i
think
that
this
beer
would
be
this
good
try
this
on
for
size
trappist
westvletern
blonde
is
a
better
belgian
pale
ale
than
trappist
westvleteren
12
is
a
quadrupel
find
a
fresh
hoppy
bottle
and
prepare
to
enter
beer
heaven
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
deep
golden
color
with
a
small
head
there
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
is
above
average
it
smells
a
bit
sour
but
there
are
spices
and
pear
aromas
as
well
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
blondes
ive
had
and
my
biggest
regret
is
that
i
wasnt
able
to
get
a
fresh
bottle
the
spices
were
notable
in
this
beer
in
the
taste
and
the
base
taste
in
this
beer
seemed
to
be
like
a
sour
apple
overall
this
beer
was
mild
but
it
tasted
great
the
mouthfeel
was
near
perfect
but
maybe
a
bit
undercarbonated
this
was
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
and
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
d
high
this
is
the
best
belgian
i
have
had
to
date
really
smooth
and
solid
not
too
complex
but
just
right
also
very
hoppy
overall
this
is
certainly
more
than
a
solid
brew
but
i
have
to
say
not
one
of
the
best
belgian
pales
that
ive
had
i
am
still
more
than
happy
to
have
tried
the
ever
elusive
westvleterens
take
on
the
style
really
good
stuff
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
anyone
jumping
over
a
cliff
to
obtain
this
drinkability
very
good
beer
in
the
style
trappist
despite
its
relative
lightness
man
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
is
truely
a
wonderful
light
beer
the
mouthfeel
and
body
were
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
was
prickly
and
perfectly
matched
to
the
flavors
while
there
may
not
have
been
any
wheat
in
the
grain
bill
there
seemed
to
be
a
slight
creaminess
in
the
beer
the
finish
was
very
dry
making
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
was
a
masterfully
crafted
hoppy
blond
ale
mouthfeel
was
full
and
prickly
all
of
the
element
of
this
beer
fit
together
well
md
very
soothing
on
the
carbonation
full
of
spongeysoft
bubbles
to
caress
the
taste
buds
the
body
is
medium
at
most
against
a
superbly
balanced
flavour
profile
this
ale
overall
is
simply
a
bliss
i
dont
think
it
would
do
this
ale
any
justice
to
compare
it
with
any
other
belgian
pale
ales
ive
had
as
this
is
truly
unique
but
in
some
apartments
it
does
strike
a
chord
more
with
the
hoppier
ones
like
de
ranke
xx
bitter
than
with
harshlyestery
counterparts
like
orval
d
this
is
a
wonderful
blonde
ale
that
has
a
very
soft
character
well
put
together
and
very
drinkable
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
and
would
definitely
have
it
again

is

this

belgian
pale

stands
head

above
most
beers
of
its

having
sampled
a
twoyearold
bottle
i
would
suggest
that
it
gains
complexity
from
a
short
stay
in

the

in

was
more

thanks
to
isubsmith
for
hooking
up
his
fellow
rochester
bas
with
this
rare
beer
the
color
is
a
clear
shinny
blonde
the
head
is
a
firm
white
cap
of
foam
that
recedes
slowly
leaving
wonderful
lacing
all
over
the

the
aroma
is
yeast
leathery
breay
and
barnyard
funky
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
more
in
depth
there
is
a
nice
mild
sourness
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
orval
but
with
a
more
malty
tone
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
and
lively
fine
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
i
would
love
for
this
beer
to
be
a
regular
in
my
drinking
rotation
md
light
bodied
carbonation
is
near
perfect
level
drinability
is
as
good
as
it
gets
easy
to
go
down
not
so
easy
to
get
your
hands
on
a
great
beer
through
and
through
d
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
an
interesting
try
but
i
dont
think
id
try
to
get
another
bottle
not
bad
for
the
style
but
not
very
interesting
to
me
either
d
though
not
as
well
reviewed
or
thought
of
as
the
westy
8
and
12
here
on
ba
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
albeit
hard
to
get
and
thus
way
overpriced
d
very
drinkable
which
is
bad
considering
how
hard
it
is
to
get
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
but
the
stuff
is
pretty
damn
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
if
it
was
available
i
would
session
it
mouthfeel
borders
on
the
lightmedium
side
carbonation
is
fairly
lively
and
it
finishes
on
the
bitter
side
oh
and
the
foam
did
last
the
entire
session
a
definite
stepdown
from
the
12
but
definitely
not
a
disappointment
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
d
it
is
a
nice
blonde
clean
and
crisp
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
slightly
hazy
with
lots
of
sodalike
bubbles
of
carbonation
and
a
strong
white
head
that
gets
a
little
sticky

the
end
of
the
glass

hops
with
citrus
esters

in

beginning
of
the
quaff
followed
by
tons
of

a
strong
yeast
character
alcohol
is
an
after
thought
sweet
but
bitter
after
taste
very
well
made
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
like
the
8
or
12
but
incredible
all
the
same
shit
yea
i
recommend
it
unfortunately
good
luck
finding
a
bottle
overall
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
a
bit
difficult
to
obtain
but
worth
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
d
easy
to
drink
and
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
its
a
great
beer
but
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
amount
of
money
it
takes
to
have
shipped
over
from
belgium
its

that
i
would
definitely

out

of

back
we
dont
recommend
aging
this

at
all
everyone
please
stop
its
obvious
that
much
of
the
hop
character
has
been
muted
with

taking
over
the

creating
new

unwanted
ﬂavors

it

with
its
clean
bitterness

thirstquenching
bliss
intact
after
having
this
quite
a
few
times
at
different
ages
its
pretty
evident
that
its
best
at
its
freshest
when
the
hops
are
most
evident
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing

hey
arent
all
trappists
beers

a

taste
pops
with
the
lemon
up
front
which
gives
way
to
the
sweet
wheat
flavor
before
finishing
with
a
very
crisp
light
finish
there
is
a
spiciness
that
remains
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
and
seriously
crisp
drinkability
is
great
with
this
one
and
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
on
a
hot
summer
day
too
too
drinkable
awesome
drinkability
was
quite
good
the
moderately
low
alcohol
content
and
the
crisp
snappiness
of
this
brew
make
it
an
ideal
apertif
drinkability
is
high
as
the
beer
has
great
flavor
profile
and
low
alcohol
could
sit
by
the
pool
and
drink
them
all
day
thank
unholy2
for
the
opportunity
to
complete

quaffable
and
a
beer
that
is
quite
enjoyable
this
bottle
is
from

thanks

aaron
notes
excellent
stuff
a
beer
i
could
drink
frequently
if
not
for
the
rarity
and
cost
d
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
one
down
two
to
go
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
doughy
with
some
sweet
fruit
and
spice
notes
maybe
some
hops
the
taste
is
great
i
cannot
believe
how
much
flavor
they
packed
in
this
beer
it
is
different
because
the
flavor
is
not
super
intense
or
overpowering
but
has
multiple
layers
a
bit
of
hops
some
malt
and
yeasty
characters
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
comes
on
slow
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
mediumlight
body
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
if
you
have
the
rare
opportunity
to
try
one
i
highly
suggest
it
enjoy
ya
know
i
think
this
westvletern
brewery
has
gotten
the
brewing
thing
all
figured
out
thanks
pwoody
youre
a
world
class
trader
overall
im
impressed
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
had
in
about
the
six
months
ive
been
back
in
germany
it
is
definitely
worth
making
a
trip
to
the
westvleteren
monastery
for
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
ive
ever
had
no
sign
ofalcohol
present
so
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
more
than
a
few
if
only
they
were
a
bit
easier
to
come
by
this
was
my
first
bottle
from
2
crates
i
recently
picked
up
at
the
abbay
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
straw
like
color
the
pour
produced
a
one
inch
thick
head
that
later
gave
way
to
a
thick
sticky
ring
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pleasing
to
my
nose
with
a
balance
of
citrus
and
spice
along
with
a
good
wheat
character
and
yeast
as
well
the
taste
was
a
very
nice
mix
of
the
sweet
with
a
good
dose
of
citrus
but
also
a
good
backbone
of
hop
bitterness
the
beer
produces
a
very
solid
wheat
character
that
is
refreshing
but
makes
for
a
medium
bodied
beer
light
bodied
but
still
firm
and
smooth
lively
carbonated
brings
herbal
and
yeasty
notes
a
hoppy
dry
finish
as
an
appetizer
or
a
session
beer
it
is
an
amazing
brew
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
more
of
a
fan
of
darker
beglians
still
i
would
seek
this
out
if
get
the
opportunity
this
beer
is
lighter
tasting
that
i
expected
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
be
awesome
to
have
it
just
laying
around
to
session
very
easy
to
drink
nice
clean
easy
to
drink
balanced
belgian
pale
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
is
cereal
citrus
floral
and
spicy
hops
are
noticeable
the
smell
is
intense
and
complex
the
taste
is
as
complex
as
the
aroma
cereal
and
bitterness
are
accented
with
floral
and
citrus
flavors
the
bitterness
hits
intensely
at
onset
but
fades
to
a
nice
lingering
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
seems
quite
appropriate
for
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
but
complex
beer
that
lends
itself
to
drinking
not
as
spectacular
as
its
bigbrother
the
12
but
great
nonetheless
thiss
my
second
ever
westvleteren
blond
with
an
interesting
difference
its
freshness
date
is
24
nov
2007
i
am
2
days
away
from
its
so
called
expiration
but
anyway
its
like
i
am
just
done
with
a
whole
load
of
academic
crap
and
i
was
deciding
what
to
drink
for
the
night
posted
something
on
ba
to
poll
for
opinions
and
in
the
end
thought
i
would
chill
out
with
a
light
one
away
from
all
the
big
beers
for
today
on
to
the
beer
this
one
smells
citrusy
grassy
malty
and
yeasty
the
yeasts
took
a
stronger
stand
after
the
pour
but
before
the
pour
off
the
opening
i
had
nice
sweetness
admist
the
malts
and
minimal
yeast
the
pour
again
yielded
one
of
the
best
lookers
though
i
am
pretty
sure
this
one
is
murkier
than
my
previous
westy
blond
probably
due
to
the
age
and
dark
sediments
but
i
just
love
the
way
the
creamy
head
develops
very
nice
it
comes
up
nice
and
after
the
pour
it
continues
to
grow
in
a
very
nice
way
leaving
a
smooth
looking
creamy
head
that
you
almost
feel
like
touching
it
to
feel
it
the
entry
was
a
refreshing
scent
of
yeast
mixed
with
malts
and
grassiness
and
as
we
move
towads
the
finish
the
malts
take
over
there
was
a
slight
malt
sweetness
throughout
which
made
it
pretty
pleasant
the
finish
was
dry
and
slightly
bitter
leaving
a
nice
bready
nose
and
a
very
lasting
after
taste
made
up
of
malts
and
grapes
there
was
also
some
breadiness
in
the
after
taste
as
well
interesting
that
after
sitting
around
for
a
good
5
minutes
the
after
taste
feels
like
pears
body
is
somewhere
between
medium
to
thin
and
the
carbonation
goes
in
strong
and
its
smoothness
is
water
like
with
a
slight
creamy
touch
not
fantastic
on
the
smoothness
as
illustrated
in
my
last
tasting
perhaps
the
carbonation
was
a
little
too
high
on
this
one
though
it
is
wierd
as
this
ones
older
nonetheless
a
great
blond
for
someone
like
me
who
aint
really
into
blonds
this
one
ranks
up
there
with
duvel
if
not
going
beyond
the
duvel
i
think
i
enjoyed
it
more
the
last
time
but
i
cant
be
too
sure
perhaps
fresher
is
better
for
this
one
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
very
light
and
very
very
clean
probably
the
cleanest
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
if
it
was
more
widely
available
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
perhaps
that
would
be
frowned
upon
by
the
monks
of
westvleteren
overall
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
clean
tasting
some
complexity
but
it
almost
begs
to
be
left
alone
and
enjoyed
without
pomp
or
attention
spendy
for
what
it
is
but
worth
a
try
when
you
are
wanting
a
lighter
beer
and
can
get
one
cant
say
im
impressed
but
cmon
i
knew
i
was
drinking
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
this
one
its
a
very
good
beer
in
itself
but
dont
know
if
its
worth
the
price
or
hassle
to
obtain
more
many
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
graciously
sharing
this
rare
example
a
masterfully
crafted
beer
for
what
it
is
and
not
overrated
a
bit
take
any
opportunity
you
can
to
get
your
hands
on
some
though
im
sure
you
would
anyway
ive
heard
many
people
complain
that
this
is
an
inferior
beer
to
the
other
westy
offerings
and
because
it
costs
the
same
its
not
worth
you
time
if
i
could
afford
the
shipping
cost
on
a
regular
basis
id
buy
this
by
the
case
for
weekend
kick
starts
i
havent
tried
the
others
yet
but
i
am
greatly
looking
forward
to
it
based
upon
the
quality
of
this
inferior
offering
decent
mouthfeel
clings
fair
but
no
crispness
carbonation
could
be
better
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
thick
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
great
retention
this
stuff
really
sticks
smell
is
nice
sweet
and
malty
honey
bread
floral
grassy
hops
some
spice
wheat
noble
hoppy
goodness
taste
is
similar
nice
malts
bread
and
biscuits
floral
and
grassy
hops
wheat
bit
of
spice
sweet
tea
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
refreshing
nice
example
of
a
blond
very
happy
i
could
try
this
one
thanks
jan
so
is
it
overrated
yeah
probably
a
little
but
its
something
different
for
the
belgian
pale
category
props
it
has
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
its
so
easydrinking
its
hard
to
savor
i
just
want
to
drink
it
all
as
most
beer
afficionados
know
if
a
beer
glass
is
clean
there
will
be
a
foam
ring
layered
for
each
drink
you
take
from
this
glass
or
mug
if
the
mug
is
dirty
then
it
will
not
as
for
the
beer
i
usually
review
wines
but
for
this
special
beer
i
was
utterly
impressed
from
start
to
finsh
the
ullage
was
great
and
the
brew
poured
with
a
distinctive
thick
head
having
not
partaken
of
any
ales
or
stronger
brews
in
awhile
this
jumped
off
my
pallate
like
a
springboard
the
experience
was
one
i
will
remember
for
some
time
i
ended
up
drinking
three
with
a
nice
bratwurst
worth
the
expense
i
paid
having
it
shipped
here
from
belgium
d
quite
drinkable
it
falls
short
of
its
brothers
in
many
ways
but
it
is
a
superior
witt
and
at
or
near
the
head
of
the
class
of
belgium
pale
ales
for
the
dollars
invested
id
rather
play
with
the
8
or
12
but
id
never
kick
this
blonde
out
of
my
cooler
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
light
and
very
refreshing
good
stuff
thanks
again
jan
aroma
surprised
me
a
bit

on
the
musty
sour
side
of
an
apple
barrow
bits
of
citrus
mingle
about
citrusy
and
sharp
itd
be
easy
to
sip
down
several
while
seated
in
a
countryside
belgium
café
just
enough
hops
to
balance
er
out
meekly
pushing
to
the
hoppy
side
the
taste
is
delicious
highly
drinkable
to
bad
i
only
have
one
oh
well
i
still
have
three
of
the
8s
and
2
of
the
12s
to
enjoy
has
hints
of
hops
spice
a
long
finish
you
can
really
feel
this
brew
at
the
back
of
the
throat
outstanding
cheers
it
has
a
pale
straw
colored
cloudy
body
with
a
one
inch
white
head
initially
that
fell
fairly
quickly
it
smells
very
yeasty
and
malty
with
some
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
hefe
with
some
banana
and
maybe
apple
the
flavor
is
not
at
all
what
i
would
have
expected
but
it
is
indeed
good
it
was
much
hoppier
than
i
would
have
expected
with
both
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
it
had
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
as
well
and
then
finished
with
a
malty
finish
i
think
i
got
some
noble
hop
aroma
in
there
but
i
could
be
wrong
it
is
fairly
light
bodied
it
could
have
been
the
situation
but
it
seemed
like
the
perfect
summer
drink
d
it
is
pretty
good
but
aftertaste
is
pretty
much
not
there
dont
think
i
would
get
this
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
damn
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
wouldnt
it
dont
see
that
happening
anytime
soon
though
great
mild
tasting
beer
but
with
very
nice
flavors
very
drinkable
believe
the
hype
the
beers
of
westvleteren
are
in
a
class
of
their
own
33cl
bottle
got
this
with
the
12
8
that
i
bought
from
belgian
shop
hadnt
read
the
reviews
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
has
quite
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
not
over
the
top
very
well
balanced
dry
finish
certainly
different
from
the
8
and
12
but
still
very
good
how
can
i
join
the
abbey
the
taste
had
a
bitterness
to
it
that
i
wasnt
anticipating
i
didnt
find
it
offensive
i
simply
wasnt
expecting
it
based
on
how
sweet
the
smell
was
the
honey
in
the
smell
had
me
thinking
and
hoping
this
would
be
sweeter
than
it
was
taste
was
sweet
for
a
split
second
and
then
turned
quickly
to
bitter
hops
then
turned
pleasantly
dry
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
good
certainly
live
up
to
the
westy
hype
not
this
one
perhaps
yellow
cap
but
to
date
i
have
not
had
it
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
a
belgian
pale

yeasty
hoppy
and
flavorful
its
difficult
not
to
rave
about
this
brewery
a
great
summersession
beer
fairly
complex
flavor
profile
for
that
type
of
beer
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
trappist
ale
worth
a
try
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
expectations
the
baby
of
the
westvleteren
family
that
said
full
of
flavour
lots
of
fruity
dry
yeasty
character
i
wish
i
had
more
d
this
was
good
but
fairly
standard
over
rated
for
sure
iverall
this
was
a
great
beer
hugely
enjoyable
but
the
price
really
cuts
the
drinkabilty
down
for
me
awesome
nonetheless
and
glad
to
have
had
some
off
to
the
rest
of
the
westy
that
said
the
blonde
is
a
lovely
brew
nice
white
head
and
golden
body
lacing
down
the
glass
an
aroma
of
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
spices
and
beauty
the
taste
while
on
the
subdued
side
is
much
better
than
ive
been
lead
to
believe
wheat
grass
hops
and
a
lovely
zesty
lemon
orange
citrus
give
it
a
witlike
feel
to
it
very
nice
very
smooth
slightly
zesty
carbonation
even
still
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
had
in
at
least
month
i
lose
track
quickly
taste
lets
me
down
slightly
but
only
slightly
spicy
herbal
and
slightly
floral
are
the
hops
the
malt
seems
a
little
restrained
but
it
combines
with
the
yeast
to
create
a
fruitiness
that
complements
the
rest
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
perfect
full
creamy
and
lively
from
the
smooth
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
all
dayeveryday
if
i
could
my
700th
review
on
ba
poured
from
the
bottle
to
my
snifter
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
around
the
glass
some
faint
smell
of
spice
and
malt
in
the
aroma
taste
is
mostly
pale
flavors
of
spice
malt
and
yeast
that
leaves
a
somewhat
sticky
after
taste
this
is
a
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
brew
with
subtle
flavors
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
to
pale
for
my
taste

poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
yellow
color
with
a
large
creamy
white
sticky
head
beautiful
aroma
consisting
of
a
sweet

perfumelike
aroma
faint
citrus
and
must
and
a
bit
of

the
taste
features
a
nice
slightly
spicy
hop
profile
that
finishes
extremely
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
but
seems
to
be
undercarbonated
overall
this
is
another
stellar
brew
from
westvleteren
and
one
that
i
could
certainly
drink
all
night
long
if
it
wasnt
for
its
rareness
worth
the
trip
from
frankfurt
am
to
get
this
brew
will
go
again
in
march
to
see
if
i
can
get
any
more
from
these
great
monks
a
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
beer
having
this
beer
so
fresh
is
quite
an
experience
and
enhances
all
aspects
i
nearly
messed
myself
when
i
opened
this
present
but
so
far
this
one
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
a
very
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
but
im
not
sure
this
one
is
worth
going
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
leading
to
a
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
flavors
are
somewhat
muted
with
only
a
bitter
europilsner
flavor
and
the
presence
of
fresh
cut
grass
a
faint
hint
of
malt
sweetness
creeps
in
towards
the
end
but
it
is
overwhelmed
by
the
spicyness
of
the
hops
this
is
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
and
im
a
little
disappointed
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
light
bodied
very
well
carbonated
without
being
stingy
not
watery
or
thin
highly
drinkable
easy
to
session
and
enjoy
the
only
draw
back
is
the
rarity
and
the
price
25
bucks
a
bottle
though
is
a
bit
high
i
have
tried
it
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
light
bodied
but
not
thin
in
the
least
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
this
beer
is
very
smooth
frankly
this
beer
would
be
very
hard
to
improve
this
would
rank
among
my
all
time
greatest
session
beers
except
for
the
rarity
notes
i
was
blown
away
with
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
started
off
on
the
wrong
foot
with
the
decent
appearance
and
then
a
uneventful
smell
then
it
gives
you
this
burst
of
hops
and
tons
of
flavor
fairly
dry
overall
my
take
is
that
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
to
date

love
it
unbelievable

actually
quenches
thirst
if
this
was
readily

i
would
have
no
use
for

anymore
absolute
favorite

to
be

the

meticulously

with
perfect

may
be
the

sugariness
white
grape
juice
and
a
light
honey
flavor
are
apparent
in
the
taste
very
creamy
and
smooth
medium
body
with
a
light
pepperiness
that
enters
midtaste
and
lingers
thru
the
aftertaste
a
decent
sized
grassy
bitterness
is
drying
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
very
nice
mouthfeel
drinkability
one
of
the
most
suprising
trappists
ive
drunk
to
date
not
least
because
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
more
than
one
bottle
of
without
being
wasteful
of
course
youve
got
to
find
another
bottle
first
and
when
you
do
be
prepared
to
spend
27
50
to
buy
it
this
is
after
all
sweden
but
you
get
the
general
idea
a
fine
sessionable
beer
worth
the
sweat
carrying
back
from
the
abbey
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
certainly
partake
quite
a
bit
in
it
if
it
were
readily
available
in
the
area
or
in
the
us
for
that
matter
thumbs
up
d
this
is
much
drier
than
i
was
expecting
and
that
was
a
really
pleasant
surprise
i
was
almost
expecting
to
be
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
wasnt
but
thats
not
the
beers
fault
its
still
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
its
not
so
awesomely
awesome
that
ill
be
looking
to
go
all
missionimpossible
again
to
track
another
bottle
down
on
the
cheap
drier
and
less
fruity
than
many
of
the
more
widely
available
blondes
and
that
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
ample
leaving
gorgeous
lacing
patterns
in
the
oversized
wine
glass
a
worderful
picture
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
confectioners
sugar
belgian
yeast
and
spices
clove
and
black
pepper
i
could
smell
this
alone
and
be
happy
palate
is
complex
and
encompassing
with
sweet
malt
and
some
terrific
citrus
notes
a
perfect
hop
balance
keeps
this
beer
from
being
cloying
in
a
masterful
way
relatively
dry
finish
and
the
taste
gains
complexity
as
it
warms
spiciness
lingers
on
long
after
you
swallow
this
beer
has
an
absolutely
incredible
mouthfeel
that
is
thick
but
not
heavy
substantial
but
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
a
sublime
blonde
from
the
brothers
at
westvleteren
i
could
drink
this
one
at
any
time
if
only
i
had
more
than
two
bottles
terrific
the
taste
is
also
very
grainy
and
also
has
a
bit
of
a
corn
syrup
flavor
i
suspect
it
is
much
better
fresher
but
it
was
still
good
enough
i
preferred
the
3
year
old
version
of
rochefort
6
to
this
2
year
old
westy
though
as
i
mentioned
it
is
not
a
direct
comparison
pours
a
hazy
blonde
with
a
myriad
of
microscopic
bubbles
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
chalice
eventually
working
their
way
up
to
join
the
dense
rocky
head
that
sits
atop
smells
of
apricot
and
peaches
with
a
hint
of
banana
even
too
cold
which
this
is
because
im
too
impatient
to
wait
it
to
warm
from
fridge
temp
the
aroma
is
warm
and
inviting
the
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
though
still
persistent
lace
which
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
taste
fruit
followed
by
an
earthy
undertone
from
the
yeast
with
a
hint
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
is
just
enough
to
counterbalance
the
initial
sweetness
suprisingly
dry
finish
given
the
fruit
upfront
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
just
a
whisper
too
thin
if
im
splitting
hairs
drinkability
is
only
limited
by
the
rareness
of
this
gem
ive
had
their
other
two
current
offerings
and
would
rate
this
the
lowest
of
the
three
but
thats
like
trying
to
select
a
date
from
selma
hayak
her
other
two
triplet
sisters
if
you
can
try
this
beer
do
so
finishes
with
a
husky
graininess
some
drying
bitterness
and
stale
vanilla
delightfully
crisp
and
wonderfully
drinkable
but
hardly
the
kind
of
show
stealer
that
are
its
older
siblings
smell
is
unique
grassy
and
hoppy
it
actually
smells
similar
to
marijuana
quite
nice
taste
is
sweet
but
balanced
is
that
apple
or
pear
that
i
taste
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
wow
tiny
tiny
bubbles
how
do
they
do
that
drinkability
is
awesome
so
inviting
an
interesting
offering
from
the
trappist
monks
at
westvleteren
into
a
chalice
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
high
carbonation
yeilding
a
large
pillow
of
white
foam
bubbles
stream
upwards
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aromas
of
grassy
spices
and
the
trademark
yeasty
and
malty
note
that
only
trappist
brews
have
nice
taste
is
quite
complex
dry
notes
of
malts
and
wheat
blend
with
a
grassy
hay
note
followed
by
light
apple
flavors
and
a
pinch
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
accenuates
the
the
nuances
and
qualities
of
this
brew
very
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
like
satin
drinkability
is
good
special
thanks
goes
out
to
boolshot
for
providing
the
sample
drinkability
outstanding
this
beer
is
the
greatest
invention
since
wood
drinkability
is
high
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
with
a
very
subdued
sugar
taste
in
the
swallow
overall
an
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
not
quite
as
good
as
the
8
or
the
12
but
still
pretty
damn
good
its
very
good
and
would
be
a
regular
quaff
in
this
household
if
it
werent
so
damn
scarce
even
though
i
wish
the
flavor
measured
up
with
the
more
buoyant
and
refreshing
aroma
its
hard
to
dislike
anything
about
this
drinkability
probably
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
that
ive
had
its
refreshing
and
crisp
with
flavors
that
dont
overpower
not
what
i
expected
or
wanted
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
ill
still
keep
my
eyes
out
for
the
westy
8
and
12
but
i
would
skip
this
one
in
the
future
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
it
was
easier
to
find
since
its
not
i
dont
mind
drinking
any
number
of
pale
ales
in
its
place
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
goes
down
really
smooth
and
refreshing
a
delight
on
a
nice
sunny
day
like
today
truly
a
tasty
blonde
ale
and
one
that
i
would
imbibe
much
more
often
given
the
chance
one
day
i
will
get
to
belgium
and
sample
this
at
the
source
that
much
is
for
certain
ev
thanks
again
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
liked
the
hefe
i
brewed
better
same
bananayeasty
aroma
and
flavor
without
the
concerning
numbing
characteristic
drinkability
drinkable
enough
its
not
my
first
choice
when
i
reach
for
a
trappist
but
it
is
not
a
bad
ale
overall
aftertaste
typical
westvleteren
if
i
didnt
know
better
might
think
it
was
the
darker
beers
many
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
fine
and
hardtofind
brew
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
and
makes
a
dense
white
head
head
retention
is
very
good
lacing
is
quite
nice
aroma
is
rather
faint
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
and
alot
of
yeasty
esters
really
nice
nutty
caramel
flavor
slightly
sweet
honey
light
spices
and
light
fruit
hint
of
bittering
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
superb
very
rich
and
creamy
gently
coating
the
palate
and
then
closes
with
a
clean
dry
finish
theres
nothing
overrated
about
a
westy
even
the
little
blonde
with
quite
a
bit
of
aging
very
enjoyable
oh
if
i
could
only
session
this
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yeast
filled
dirty
blonde
it
leaves
a
thick
white
head
that
drips
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
sweet
lime
honey
plum
fruit
cake
as
i
taste
this
beer
the
flavors
previously
mentioned
come
out
the
lemon
rind
honey
bitterness
all
are
enhanced
by
the
crisp
carbonation
of
this
brew
this
belgian
is
delicious
one
that
satisfies
with
complex
flavors
and
crisp
taste
tasted
at
the
in
de
vrede
cafe
over
the
road
from
the
brewery
presented
in
a
westvleteren
challis
hazy
straw
yellow
with
plenty
of
bright
white
compact
head
perfectly
filling
the
challis
aroma
is
of
honey
and
feint
cloves
with
the
very
slightest
hint
of
flowery
hops
subtle
and
nicely
balanced
taste
is
so
well
balanced
it
is
hard
to
pick
out
individual
flavours
maybe
some
orange
peel
over
the
malt
background
with
a
little
light
clove
spiciness
finish
is
nicely
balanced
with
crisp
refreshing
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
beyond
that
there
is
no
hops
flavour
dominance
noticeable
mouth
was
light
and
fluffy
but
not
watery
complemented
the
flavours
nicely
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
which
it
was
when
i
visited
a
pity
i
was
limited
to
only
one
as
i
had
to
drive
back
to
paris
looking
forward
to
trying
the
8
and
12s
i
have
brought
home
tastes
dry
light
sweet
maltyness
theres
a
crackery
type
aftertaste
at
the
end
slightly
toasty
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
watery
but
extremely
dry
at
the
end
like
i
want
to
reach
for
water
type
dry
fairly
drinkable
but
the
dryness
thing
is
just
i
dont
know
maybe
one
has
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
a
good
brew
i
havent
had
too
many
belgian
pale
ales
and
it
strikes
me
that
this
is
as
its
meant
to
me
so
this
may
be
better
as
per
style
than
im
giving
it
credit
for
but
there
is
something
a
bit
lacking
for
me
poured
into
a
rapscallion
snifter
formed
a
34
bright
white
head
over
the
translucent
golden
brew
the
head
stays
as
is
and
lacing
is
sticky
and
prevalent
aroma
is
sweet
pale
maltiness
with
a
tinge
of
spicing
and
a
touch
of
some
citrus
taste
starts
with
some
light
malt
sweetness
touches
on
the
spices
and
citrus
again
and
closes
with
a
combination
of
these
flavors
lingering
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
least
favorite
of
the
three
but
the
bar
had
been
set
pretty
high
by
the
other
two
well
i
have
worked
my
way
down
the
westy
ladder
and
enjoyed
the
trip
while
not
as
good
as
the
8
or
12
you
can
still
tell
that
this
beer
is
crafted
with
skill
and
care
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
super
thick
white
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
thick
sheets
of
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
mediumbodied
and
dry
with
spicy
hops
and
citrus
flavoring
wonderful
balance
throughout
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
with
yeast
and
spice
flavors
id
love
to
have
any
of
the
westy
brews
again
but
considering
the
hefty
price
tag
ill
probably
stick
with
the
12
from
here
on
out
d
this
is
a
great
beer
goes
with
food
or
on
its
own
great
the
smell
is
very
nice
bringing
a
nice
combination
of
herbs
and
hops
on
top
of
a
light
malt
base
the
taste
is
crisp
and
the
hops
definitely
stick
out
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
for
the
style
while
drinkability
is
very
good
no
label
just
the
famous
green
cap
pours
a
hazy
yellow
like
any
blonde
with
little
head
smells
strongly
of
hops
the
initial
taste
on
the
tongue
is
definitely
very
hoppy
almost
like
an
american
pale
ale
it
lingers
for
a
long
time
the
more
and
more
sips
you
have
it
begins
to
loose
its
hop
and
starts
to
evolve
into
more
of
a
traditional
blonde
flavor

i

this
all
night
too
bad
i
only
have
one
bottle
left
a
very
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
rainy
day
the
beer
is
not
big
in
any
aspect
but
makes
up
for
any
lacking
in
its
mixture
of
elements
the
spicy
taste
and
the
subtle
phenolics
are
my
favorites
beer
is
good
happy
beering
poured
out
a

with
a
ton
of
yeasty

floating

the
flavors
get
better
with
each
sip
good
amount
of
carbination
but
yet
it
is
not
too
much
bit
of
foaming
up
over
your
tongue
but
nothing
too
extreme
the
feel
is
just
right
for
the
style
light
feeling
it
just
flows
through
your
mouth
very
easy
drinker
but
not
one
i
would
pick
for
a
regular
drinker
if
it
was
one
that
was
just
normally
sitting
around
here
and
there
that
is
notes
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
the
westvleteren

8
and
blonde
for
a
long
time
i
had
all
three
on
the
same
day
and
the
blonde
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
3
despite
the

by

my

a
good
dose
of
various
herbs
is
always
a
pleasure
to
taste
as
long
as
its
more
of
a
complement
than
the
unique
focus
no
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
there
thats
their
session
beer
it
just
made
a
monk
out
of
me
taste
a
slow
malt
start
but
with
a
nice
dry
finish
and
mild
hop
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
was
obviously
less
present
than
the
12
but
i
thought
it
held
up
really
well
and
i
regret
not
bringing
some
back
with
me
from
my
trip
imho
not
well
balanced
not
what
i
expected
lovely
but
this
replaced
the
red
cap
why
superbly
wellputtogether
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
but
it
is
certainly
in
the
upper
tier
of
the
style
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance

with
enjoyable
nuances
of
tart
very
smooth
the
powerful
hops
at
the
end
leave
a
longlasting
and
thick
mouthfeel
a
really
good
beer
complex
i
wish
id
be
able
to
detect
more
elements
to
describe
it
maybe
next
time
the
taste
an
enhanced
malt
and
rustic
feel
that
is
literally
overwhelmed
by
this
wave
of
hops
at
the
end
strong
tasteful
definetly
a
great
beer
taste
i
poured
this
beer
at
about
40
degrees
so
some
of
the
initial
flavor
was
lost
due
to
temperature
and
alcohol
covering
some
up
however
i
did
get
a
taste
of

i
loved
this
beer
much
diffeetn
then
the
other
2
westys
this
was
the
only
blond
i
sampled
but
i
just
loved
it
overall
the
westvleteren
dna
is
definitely
present
in
the
latest
offering
from
the
st
sixtus
abbey
a
replacement
for
the
often
raw
special
6
red
cap
this
is
a
much
better
beer
in
my
opinion
and
adds
a
genuine
lower
gravity
quaffer
to
the
westie
fleet
this
is
a
very
good
high
quality
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
is
the
base
offering
from
the
st
sixtus
abdij
its
true
to
say
that
it
is
not
up
there
with
the
12
or
even
the
8
but
it
is
really
not
that
far
behind
either
overall
impression
if
im
not
mistaken
the
water
down
in
westvleteren
is
quite
high
in
carbonate
hardness
similar
to
orvals
water
could
be
the
reason
for
the
minerally
mouthfeel
and
accentuated
hop
bitterness
this
is
my
first
taste
of
westvleteren
and
i
have
to
say
im
not
blown
away
im
going
to
withhold
judgement
until
ive
tried
the
whole
line
after
all
who
can
ignore
the
constant
raves
about
12
light
gold
color
medium

aroma
is
floral
honey
lemon

wow
this
is
the
best

beer
i
think
ive
had
to
date
floral
and
refreshing
very
clean
taste
fruity
lemons
floral
candy
sugar
and
yeasts
very
nice
beer
it
took
me
several
minutes
before
i
tasted
this
beer
because
it
smelled
so
good
very
clean
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
thin
but
persistent
head
that
leaves
behind
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
yeasty
and
musty
with
some
herbal
notes
flavor
begins
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
herbal
bitterness
and
some
musty
yeast
at
the
finish
has
a
light
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
its
too
bad
this
one
is
so
hard
to
obtain
peppery
notes
and
a
dry
bitterness
fill
the
palate
the
beer
becomes
a
bit
more
juicy
midglass
finishes
clean
and
peppery
a
well
rounded
belgian
pale
but
is
it
worth
the
price
i
really
dont
think
so
but
i
cant
wait
to
sample
the
rest
of
their

full
of

super
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
cheers
to
the
belgianbum
that
dropped
this
on
me
way
back
last
winter
very
good
originally
sampled
on
26
november
2002
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
is
that
westvleterens
other
two
beers
are
world
beaters
this
one
is
merely
exceptionally
good
its
cloudy
yellow
w
a
huge
white
head
it
has
a
spicy
flavorclean
finish
next
time
id
have
this
one
on
a
hot
day
great
appearance
bright
gold
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
is
not
out
of
control
interesting
sweet
cherry
aroma
flavor
is
dry
malt
hay
sand
cloves
and
a
surprisingly
bitter
finish
the
dryness
was
surprising
and
could
almost
pass
for
an
experimental
pilsner
with
some
of
the
fruity
spicy
flavors
going
on
thanks
for
sharing
senior
after
a
string
of
highalcohol
belgian
offerings
this
lowerhorsepower
ale
was
a
treat
and
something
of
a
relief
soft
aroma
of
candy
sugar
and
bready
yeast
flavor
was
a
bit
more
malty
than
other
belgian
blondes
but
nicely
balanced
with
reserved
bright
yeasty
fruit
notes
this
one
does
not
try
to
go
over
the
top
and
focuses
instead
on
being
a
quality
mild
ale
thanks
to
belgianbum
for
the
sample
this
beer
i
almost
missed
since
the
only
difference
is
the
cap
it
poured
a
very
foamy
bubbly
light
gold
color
and
formed
a
foamy
head
that
left
a
fairly
thick
coating
of
lace
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
and
sediment
was
presentbut
due
to
the
foam
i
probably
poured
too
much
of
it
from
the
bottom
an
aroma
of
hops
and
grain
with
a
slight
hint
of
clove
a
flavor
of
hops
grain
and
a
bit
peppery
the
finish
also
hint
at
the
pepper
a
good
beer
drinkability
notes
this
one
is
off
the
charts
as
far
as
a
session
brew
for
me
i
simply
could
drink
this
all
night
by
far
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
run
into
and
would
travel
and
have
far
for
f
notes
drinkability
definiately
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
beers
i
simply
cant
get
enough
of
this
dry
and
bitter
beer
which
is
not
too
typical
of
belgian
beers
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
golden
yellow
the
head
adequate
in
size
bubbly
in
its
consistency
the
lace
in
thin
sheets
that
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
malt
dominates
the
nose
hints
of
citrus
somewhat
sour
undertones
also
present
start
is
nicely
malted
and
slightly
sweet
with
the
top
lanky
finish
has
a
penetrating
acidity
the
hops
delectable
and
pleasing
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
and
somewhat
tart
aftertaste
that
lingers
long
on
the
palate
clean
and
spritzy
comes
to
mind
when
i
describe
this
beer
good
but
the
least
favorite
in
this
line
of
beers
pours
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
the
body
is
just
slightly
hazy
and
golden
with
small
bubbles
rising
up
through
the
westvleteren
goblet
herbal
hop
aromas
mix
in
with
pear
like
fruitiness
slightly
sweet
at
first
then
becomes
drier
when
the
earthy
herbal
hop
flavors
come
into
play
finishes
dry
but
not
overly
drying
could
have
used
a
little
thicker
mouthfeel
for
a
more
refined
drink
but
this
is
not
the
prurpose
of
this
beer
its
a
delicate
drink
all
the
time
type
beer
for
the
monks
wonderful
brew
very
floral
nose
beautiful
texture
quite
smooth
with
a
biting
bitterness
towards
the
end
very
dry
exceptionally
floral
hoppyness
towards
the
finish
with
some
notes
of
candy
sugar
and
some
burnt
malt
surprisingly
this
is
perhaps
the
ultimate
session
ale
if
it
were
cheap
and
readily
available
if
only
truly
remarkable
and
close
to
being
my
favourite
from
westvleteren
mystique
surrounds
this
beer
the
8
and
12
are
the
well
known
ones
but
no
one
really
talks
about
the
6
its
actually
a
as
good
as
any
blonde
ive
ever
had
it
has
that
characteristic
yeasty
flavor
of
westvleteren
beers
if
these
were
available
for
a
reasonable
price
in
the
us
i
would
buy
them
all
the
time
im
mystified
by
the
high
rating
for
this
beer
compared
to
my
experience
ill
look
for
it
again
as
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
american
trappist
allright
ill

notes
on
the
aromas
with
some
nice
dark
fruit
and
even
citrus
notes
shining
through
classic
flavors
of
a
belgian
pale
from
my
admittedly
limited
experiences
reminded
me
a
bit
of
gi
sofie
the
nice
citrus
notes
and
peppery
bite
on
the
finish
had
me
anxiously
taking
the
next
sip
nice
clean
finish
with
some
of
the
lingering
yeast
notes
fading
away
a
nice
buy
us
monks
supporting

delicious
multilevel
winner
very
nice
ale
great
flavor
and
aroma
the
trappist
label
brings
with
it
an
expectation
of
quality
while
im
not
sure
i
would
ever
choose
this
beer
over
any
of
the
other
trappists
ive
had
up
to
this
point
i
can
say
that
i
think
it
earns
its
place
next
to
them
and
does
the
label
justice
definitely
worth
a
try
i
look
forward
to
cellaring
a
few
bottles
this
stuff
ought
to
age
well
a
very
fine
beer
at
more
than
5
a
bottle
this
is
a
beer
for
a
special
occasion
this
is
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
when
i
go
for
these
golden
trappist
ales
light
and
delicious
notes
i
like
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
do
perhaps
the
monks
at
spencer
could
produce
one
or
two
more
offerings
i
imagine
that
these
guys
are
quite
capable
of
hitting
the
bulls
eye
perhaps
they
should
try
a
dubbel
or
quad
or
since
this
is
an
american
monastery
the
first
trappist
ipa
unfiltered
with
a
cloudy
golden
amber
appearance
the
aroma
is
beer
with
some
flowery
hops
taste
is
disappointing
for
a
belgian
trappist
ale
if
this
was
an
american
pale
ale
expectations
would
be
lower
but
every
other
trappist
ale
has
been
perfectly
balanced
with
no
bitterness
on
the
finish
considering
it
is
a
american
brewed
beer
the
hoppiness
and
higher
abv
is
not
surprising
as
a
final
insult
the
bottle
was
only
11
2
ounces
and
cost
6
this
is
acceptable
for
an
imported
beer
but
give
me
a
break
it
is
brewed
in
massachusetts
why
not
12
ounces
not
bad
but
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
to
stand
out
really
serving
type
bottle
it
is
easy
to
focus
a
little
too
much
on
belgiums
and
grow
tired
of
the
yeast
at
least
thats
what
i
have
done
unfortunately
this
beer
may
pave
my
way
back
in
different
and
very
good
this
patersbier
exceeded
my
expectations
for
a
relatively
light
style
it
packs
some
fruity
yeasty
goodness
with
a
nice
bit
of
clove
a
little
pricey
at
204pk
but
its
worth
picking
up
breads
aroma
highly
carbonated
good
stuff
decent
initial
head
very
loose
and
wispy
settles
down
to
a
loosely
arrayed
islands
of
bubbles
tannish
hue
with
an
orange
tint
for
lacing
you
get
minimal
splotches
with
not
too
much
stick
very
cloudy
bottle
stood
up
for
days
and
carefully
poured
still
yields
a
great
deal
of
particulate
in
the
liquid
warm
red
glow
at
the
core
but
mostly
a
bright
orange
color
of
pink
grapefruit
pulp
nothing
remarkable
about
the
visible
carbonation
the
nose
offers
biscuit
crumbs
pepper
meadow
grasses
and
earth
clove
spice
the
orange
to
lemon
citrus
pierces
the
nostrils
well
and
allows
for
more
flow
in
the
attenuated
apricot
apple
fruit
definitely
more
lingering
banana
notes
fullbodied
in
large
part
due
to
the
fluffy
expansion
coming
from
the
carbonation
lees
whipped
cream
clove
and
caraway
seed
dried
honey
less
peppery
here
the
citrus
is
indistinct
in
terms
of
flavors
but
a
large
presence
nonetheless
overall
the
profile
is
too
dry
for
you
to
get
a
lot
of
banana
or
bubblegum
but
they
are
there
apricot
pear
green
melon
fruit
of
moderate
ambition
the
finish
is
tactful
even
as
that
active
carbonation
extends
the
mouth
feel
pleasant
to
sip
pours
slightly
cloudy
with
a
generous
head
decent
nosetaste
and
feel
sweet
undertones
and
a
strong
banana
smell

good
after
dinner

bottle
of

i
dont
like
it
sorry
overall
this
probably
good
for
its
style
but
not
really
my
thing
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
would
love
to
drink
regularly
overall
drinkability
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
and
in
a
way
an
american
take
on
the
trappist
ale
easily
drinkable
and
i
would
have
had
another
one
if
i
had
not
been
distracted
by
other
goodies
on
the
la
trappe
beer
menu
went
well
with
food
mixed
green
salad
and
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
it
again
flavors
are
lightly
bitter
fresh

high

sour
dough
bread
comes

i
really
need
to
do
a
head
to
head
with
this
and
orval
it
would
make
for
a
happy
trouble
everything
is
very
well
balanced
while
i
appreciate
that
this
is
the
only
beer
this
brewerymonastery
produces
i
would
be
excited
to
see
them
putting
out
more
offerings

with
a
frothy
filmy
sparse
white
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
banana
clove
cream
and
toasted

pretty
simple
but
impressively
balanced
the
flavors
are
roasted

rich

with
banana
bread
notes
heavy

spicing
some

notes
a
sweet
and
tangy
cream
overlay
and
a

subtle

funk
throughout
with
some

esters
too
the
body
is
light

dry
and
remains
crisp
throughout
due

the
carbonation

and

blend
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
shortlived
linger
kept
clean
by

good
beer
overall
was
a
serious
effort
to
get
a
hold
of
this
gem

man

glad

this

i
have

really
a
tremendous
beer
looks
amazing

authentic

a
real
interesting
belgian
pale
ale
here
really
lively
too
on
palate
feel
not
mind
blowing
but
certainly
delicious
and
worthy
for
another
go

taste
is

with
just

excellent
balance
feels
a
bit
light
almost
weightless
on

again
not
a

overall
a
downright
excellent
beer
regardless
of
its
provenance
thoroughly
enjoyed
on
this
and
past
occasions
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
disappointing
weak
for
a
trappist
o
i
was
simultaneously
skeptical
and
excited
about
this
beer
even
though
i
was
ready
to
be
bitterly
harsh
the
skunkesque
nose
didnt
help
i
cant
be
its
good
damned
good
highly
recommended
and
i
will
be
drinking
again
i
would
and
i
will
have
this
beer
again
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
i
like
that
it
has
a
profile
that
can
be
paired
with
food
or
just
enjoyed
by
itself
this
is
a
great
trappist
ale
and
anyone
who
wants
to
venture
from
say
pilsners
or
ipas
and
into
the
world
of
true
yeast
character
would
definitely
enjoy
trying
this
beer
spicy
banana
aroma
follows
into
the
front
with
a
short
lived
bitterness
at
the
end
pretty
good
but
i
was
expecting
something
special
and
this
one
just
didnt
quite
deliver
the
same
rare
taste
like
zundert
trappist
ale
o
been
waiting
for
a
couple
of
years
to
get
the
chance
to
try
this
one
a
very
nice
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
pretty
cool
that
it
coming
from
an
american
monastery
enjoyable
flavor
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
not
necessarily
my
style
seems
well
made
and
put
together
though
glowing
orange
color
with
a
lovely
large
white
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
too
a
14
foam
top
aroma
is
soapy
flowers
banana
coriander
lemon
candy
in
the
background
all
the
elements
nicely
working
together
taste
is

im
excited
about
the

nice

from

at

from
a

bottle
that
is
months
old
straight
from
the
refrigerator
to
the
glass
some
sediment
is
apparent
banana
and
clove
aromas
accented
by
a
slightly
yeasty
and
floral
bouquet
malty
flavors
with
essences
of
cloves
and
banana
highly
carbonated
light
mouthfeel
slightly
bitter
fairly
high
alcohol
but
not
boozy
in
taste
clean
and
refreshing
taste
does
not
linger
on
the
palate
i
know
it
represents
a
classic
trappist
style
but
im
not
a
fan
too
bad
because
the
monastery
is
close
to
me
and
the
release
was
a
big
deal
around
here
on
the
front
of
the
palate
it
is
very
sweet
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
bit
too
much
yeast
hazy
golden
orange
hued
body
beneath
a
towering
head
of
airy

great
authentic

and
taste
had
nice
belgian
yeast
character
with
orange
banana
little
clove
little
candy
sugar
and
a
slight
funk
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
but
the
price
makes
a
little
tough
to
make
this
much
of
a
regular
overall
getting
this
brew
by
pure
luck
was
nothing
but
joy
for
me
cracking
it
open
was
the
first
step
to
a
great
brew
this
is
a
traditional
trappist
ale
to
the
fullest
delicious
complex
and
full
flavored
everything
ive
pretty
much
wanted
in
a
belgian
ale
like
a
mix
of
wild
yeast
and
traditional
i
would
totally
try
again
i
received
two
bottles
and
would
totally
recommend
to
a
friend
if
im
willing
to
share
cheers
overall
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
can
scratch
the
belgian
itch
without
copious
amounts
of
refined
sugar
or
adjuncts
lucky
to
have
grown
up
next
to
the
st
joseph
abbey
as
a
kid
started
off
eating
the
jelly
and
now
i
bring
home
as
many
as
these
as
i
can
when
i
visit
central
mass
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
lil
bit
of
smokey
love
on
the
back
end
o
i
would
drink
this
as
fresh
as
you
can
find
it
its
pretty
easy
to
tell
that
this
is
one
of
those
bottleconditioned
beers
that
dries
out
too
much
losing
sweet
balance
nice
to
see
an
american
monastery
venture
into
brewing
however
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
much
maybe
if
they
used
de
dolles
yeast
make
a
darker
beer
then
get
back
to
me
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
would
not
be
out
of
place
among
its
native
belgian
counterparts
heres
hoping
that
the
brothers
at
saint
josephs
have
started
a
strong
trappist
brewing
tradition
here
in
the
usa
this
is
a
very
solid
if
unspectacular
brew
the
price
will
undoubtedly
lead
to
hesitation
paid
18
for
a
4pack
in
nj
but
if
it
helps
the
brothers
succeed
and
expand
their
lineup
then
its
worth
it
notes
be
careful
when
pouring
the
beer
the
carbonation
is
very
aggressive
in
its
initial
foaming
im
really
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
the
monks
did
a
very
good
job
and
its
great
to
see
americas
first
trappist
brewery
has
the
ability
to
succeed
and
thrive
the
beer
foamed
when
i
opened
the
bottle
i
had
quite
a
mess
i
poured
the
remaining
beer
into
a
chalice
i
like
the
amber
color
i
like
the
smell
some
bready
notes
some
spice
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
good
too
spice
orange
citrus
bread
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
theres
no
cloying
flavors
and
it
is
a
bit
dry
id
rate
the
beer
higher
but
i
was
unimpressed
with
the
beer
foaming
all
over
my
counter
when
i
opened
the
bottle
its
carbonation
reminds
me
of
seltzer
have
to
remember
to
pour
it
out
of
the
bottle
though
back
story
is
cool
golden
yellow
nice
two
finger
frothy
head
very
nice
lacing
and
retention
aroma
was
topnotch
with
cloves
banana
bready
yeast
and
some
wonderful
belgian
funk
the
flavor
was
outstanding
with
some
cloves
a
bit
of
citrus
taste
and
those
wonderful
yeasty
notes
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
somewhat
dry
nice
carbonation
overall
the
monks
at
spencer
abbeys
prayers
were
answered
and
likewise
mine
to
be
able
to
brew
one
of
only
a
handful
of
trappist
brews
on
the
planet
is
quite
an
accomplishment
god
heard
the
monks
prayer
and
delivered
a
heavenly
brew
you
cant
tell
this
is
from
massachusetts
instead
of
belgium
pours

very
slowly
leaving

fantastic
what
a
great
beer
expensive
but
well
worth
it
with
a
light
wheaty
base
and
notes
of
darker
fruit
in
the
background
this
beer
is
awesome
i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
as
a
citizen
of
massachusetts
i
am
so
proud
this
comes
from
my
state
hunt
this
down
and
try

imo
just
a
really
good
beer
expensive
though
i
dont
know
too
much
about
belgian
pales
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
has
a
ton
of
that
spiciness
youd
expect
and
is
very
fizzy
and
dry
taste
a
little
orange

some

very

and
very
glad
that
america
now
has
a
trappist
offering
cloves
banana
bready
very
nice
trappist
style
o
tasty
and
very
complex
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
and
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
will
be
looking
forward
to
more
of
these
in
the
future
best
belgian
from
massachusetts
the
appearance
was
a
nice
hazy
dark
yellow
although
the
head
was
very
fizzy
the
smell
was
full
of
belgian
wheat
giving
the
smell
of
bananas
and
herbs
like
sage
the
taste
was
full
of
mint
sage
and
banana
giving
a
classic
belgian
ale
flavor
that
was
very
well
done
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
nice
with
a
medium
body
which
worked
with
the
flavors
very
well
really
enjoyed
this
one
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
price
was
right
16
for
the
4
pack
during
a
trip
from
my
native
philadelphia
to
spencer
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
spencer
trappist
ale
on
tap
at
the
black
and
white
restaurant
near
saint
josephs
abbey
the
experience
was
a
rare
treat
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
light
yeasty
aroma
i
thought
i
could
smell
a
light
citrus
or
almost
clove
smell
a
beautiful
amber
cloudy
color
the
taste
was
superb
dry
and
better
than
any
other
belgian
ive
tried
i
found
my
way
to
a
local
spirits
shop
where
i
bought
two
cases
to
take
home
this
my
friends
will
be
an
ale
that
will
be
around
for
the
ages
o
if
not
for
the
price
id
say
a
great
start
for
a
new
brewery
but
at
5
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
why
would
i
buy
this
again
price
is
certainly
a
factor
in
my
review
especially
given
its
only
a
bit
less
than
orval
and
a
bunch
more
than
duvel
ill
try
it
again
sometime
down
the
road
but
im
not
in
a
rush
to
do
that
overall
a
flavorful
example
of
a
belgian
pale
the
beer
hits
most
of
the
notes
i
expect
in
the
style
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
but
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
in
the
traditional
style
that
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
if
you
have
had
many
of
the
trappist
brews
many
things
about
this
one
will
seem
quite
familiar
oh
and
nice
website
too
feels
appropriate
for
the
favors
but
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
that
froths
up
in
the
mouth
distractingly
so
im
a
little
picky
about
this
one
but
it
really
is
lovely
shocking
to
think
its
from
the
states
o
its
a
great
beer
how
they
get
that
much
flavor
from
a
6
5
abv
im
not
sure
brought
over
to
a
cookout
by
a
good
friend
it
was
nice
to
share
not
sure
of
pricing
or
availability
out
east
id
probably
pick
up
a
bottle
given
the
opportunity
o
kind
of
pricey
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
o
enjoyable
complex
american
belgian
trappist
slightly
hazy
orange
colour
with
a
fluffy
beige
cap
good
head
retention
some
lacing
looks
nice
a
lot
of
character
from
the
yeast
aromas
of
cloves
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
fruity
esters
and
bready
malt
hint
of
citrus
low
bitterness
with
slightly
sugary
fruity
sweetness
coupled
with
clove
and
spice
throughout
maybe
a
bit
of
toffee
in
the
finish
airy
texture
lots
of
carbonation
with
mediumlight
body
good
texture
a
solid
offering
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
pour
is
hazed
deep
golden
amber
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
is
belgian
yeast
up
front
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
strong
clove
candied
sugar
and
banana
smells
sweet
taste
is
sweet
but
has
a
decent
grain
bill
and
notes
of
spicy
belgian
yeast
some
clove
candied
sugar
is
strong
definitely
sugary
and
a
hint
sweet
lighter
body
with
moderate
carb
o
this
was
very
good
for
the
style
and
im
glad
to
see
spencer
making
quality
beers
like
this
right
out
of
the
gate
however
this
didnt
quite
compare
to
the
westvletern
blond
which
had
very
similar
flavors
but
a
slightly
better
beer
all
around
if
you
like
belgian
blondes
this
is
without
a
doubt
seeking
out
and
probably
one
of
the
better
interpretations
out
there
o
a
well
done
belgian
style
pale
imo

consistent

however
the
flavors
come
off
a
bit
dull
and
subdued
finish
is
a
bit
grainy
and
i
get
a
hint
of
wet
cardboard
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
bright
carbonation
that
leaves
a
residual
prickly
across
the
roof
of
the
mouth
overall
a
decent
golden
but
definitely
does
not
warrant
the
price
point
for
what
it
is
pours
a
nice
hazy
orangegold
body
white
foam
that
has
some
legs
but
the
retention
is
average
especially
when
compared
to
others
of
the
style
candi
spice
in
the
flavor
but
minimal
very
fruit
forward
with
tangerines
being
prominent
airy
feel
with
some
banana
notes
in
the
aroma
quite
good
but
doesnt
quite
reach
to
chimay
or
rochefort
imo
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
have
it
again
and
it
reminds
me
of
what
a
fresh
trappist
ale
in
belgium
must
taste
like
why
is
it
that
a
monastery
can
just
up
and
pop
out
a
trappist
beer
and
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
while
many
other
fine
brewpubs
have
been
serving
up
meh
trappist
style
beers
for
years
o
i
made
the
mistake
of
sharing
this
between
two
glasses
approximately
89
oz
in
the
first
glass
and
the
remainder
in
a
second
glass
the
pours
between
the
two
were
drastically
different
the
first
glass
was
not
cloudy
in
appearance
and
the
second
was
translucent
the
taste
and
smell
were
completely
different
between
the
two
after
i
combined
the
glasses
i
was
presented
with
a
great
beer
i
think
the
goods
settled
to
the
bottom
i
will
be
buying
this
often
and
cant
wait
to
try
their
other
offerings
in
approx
5
years

2

this

there
was

that
leaves
some

the
nose

yeasty

a

going

here
this
is
really
a
good
beer
overall
a
very
nice
belgianstyle
pale
while
it
may
not
hold
up
to
the
best
of
the
oldworld
examples
i
must
admit
i
enjoyed
the
novelty
of
drinking
the
first
ever
american
trappist
ale
and
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
my
first
trappist
ale
and
i
have
to
say
i
will
definitely
be
trying
more
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
from
a
friend
so
on
a
recent
trip
to
massachussetts
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
from
a
store
and
tried
it
i
did
not
have
the
preferred
glass
so
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
which
was
of
course
a
little
big
the
smell
was
pleasant
but
not
perfect
with
a
quite
malty
aroma
but
what
really
hit
me
was
how
smooth
yet
robust
the
mouth
feel
was
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
taste
and
i
found
myself
lingering
on
each
sip
before
swallowing
trying
to
catch
all
the
flavors
as
there
were
quite
a
few
i
hadnt
tasted
in
a
beer
before
something
in
it
reminded
me
of
the
peaty
flavors
of
an
islay
scotch
in
any
case
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
even
for
someone
like
me
whos
generally
leans
more
towards
the
more
hoppy
varieties
fairly
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
aromas
of
yeast
bread
lightly
sweet
sugar
clove
and
pepper
with
hints
of
light
fruit
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
lightly
sweet
fruit
and
honey
like
malty
sweetness
offset
with
some
spice
and
pepper
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
light
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
price
point
is
horrible
i
would
never
buy
this
for
myself
im
glad
someone
else
shared
this
with
me
the
beer
is
golden
orange
and
mildly
hazy
with
a
quarter
inch
of
off
white
head
the
aroma
offers
belgian
style
yeast
clove
fruity
tones
bread
nice
tasting
beer
medium
bodied
a
tad
sweet
with
light
spice
undertones
some
similarities
to
a
witbier
in
that
regard
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
and
hope
to
revisit
at
some
point
really
enjoyable
overall
well
made
but
nothing
special
had
heard
differing
opinions
about
this
one
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
pleasant
experience
overall
the
yeast
is
quite
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
and
brings
a
great
array
of
flavors
my
understanding
is
that
the
monastery
has
agreed
to
brew
only
this
particular
beer
for
5
years
before
they
branch
out
i
am
marking
my
calendar
because
i
truly
look
forward
to
the
day
when
i
can
taste
a
dubbel
tripel
or
quad
from
spencer
brewery
overall
the
monks
at
spencer
know
what
theyre
doing
this
is
a
solid
first
offering
from
their
brewery
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
down
the
road
o
thanks
for
the
honor
dave
fantastic
belgian
pa
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
it
is
worth
trying
but
this
beer
comes
with
a
fairly
high
price
point
which
hinders
my
desire
to
buy
more
in
the
bangforyourbuck
department
a
similar
beer
can
be
purchased
for
less
money
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
i
hope
the
price
comes
down
so
that
i
might
enjoy
it
more
often
still
im
always
happy
to
help
out
the
trappists
with
scent
and
taste
the
best
thing
is
to
leave
you
on
your
own
it
is
not
weak
nor
is
it
strong
it
is
not
light
but
it
is
not
boozy
and
the
6
5
slides
in
without
a
ruffle
of
a
feather
youll
likely
find
some
of
the
things
mentioned
here
such
as
banana
coriander
clove
nutmeg
and
so
forth
but
youll
also
find
things
not
mentioned
here
that
are
just
your
own
and
youll
find
different
things
from
sip
to
sip
this
beer
is
not
a
bludgeon
like
so
many
at
this
price
level
and
if
you
dont
pay
some
mind
you
might
mistake
it
as
too
easy
going
for
the
expense
paid
but
given
time
and
proper
contemplation
if
youll
forgive
that
choice
of
word
youll
be
rewarded
with
a
multitude
of
subtler
pleasures
a
brew
that
grows
on
you
when
approached
with
kindness
an
interesting
blend
of
pale
malt
strong
belgian
yeast
and
coriander
classic
trappist
flavors
but
this
one
is
quite
thin
with
an
overly
elevated
carbonation
level
almost
like
champagne
the
finish
is
sour
yeasty
remnant
which
dissipates
quickly
nice
fruity
finish
some
hint
of
nutmeg
lingering
overall
fantastic
just
fantastic
this
is
a
highly
underrated
gem
that
even
allagash
would
be
proud
of
this
experience
has
left
me
to
contemplate
leaving
all
my
worldly
possessions
behind
and
join
the
monks
in
spencer
do
you
get
free
ale
for
living
the
simple
life
overall
i
was
eager
to
try
the
first
american
trappist
ale
and
it
did
not
disappoint
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
a
good
no
great
trappist
ale
fresh
tasting
clean
fruity
with
a
bit
of
spice
even
the
carbonation
reminded
me
of
little
angels
flying
up
to
heaven
too
poetic
perhaps
but
this
beer
deserves
a
little
poetry
amazing
offering
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
really
hope
the
price
comes
down
i
stumbled
across
this
at
a
local
restaurant
and
ordered
it
immediately
great
choice
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
living
in
massachusetts
i
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
the
release
of
americas
first
trappist
offering
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
i
think
i
was
expecting
an
abbey
ale
with
deep
red
color
and
fig
or
plum
flavor
i
could
not
have
been
more
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
truly
a
unique
beer
that
was
crafted
with
care
the
intense
banana
aroma
and
flavor
are
a
testament
to
the
particular
yeast
strain
that
they
so
graciously
gift
to
us
in
the
bottle
will
definitely
buy
again
summary
compared
to
the
other
authentic
trappist
beers
ive
tried
this
has
a
more
subdued
flavor
it
is
not
as
rich
or
strong
as
say
a
rochefort
or
the
gregorius
but
thats
probably
because
it
is
not
a
tripel
quad
or
strong
ale
this
beer
fits
my
stereotype
of
a
belgian
ale
although
certainly
better
than
most
i
have
tasted
an
immediate
comparison
to
an
allagash
white
comes
to
mind
but
again
this
is
much
better
it
has
a
sweetness
to
its
taste
with
a
smell
of
cloves
and
banana
i
really
dont
know
what
cloves
smell
like
it
is
not
a
strong
smell
but
definitely
fruity
i
guess
the
carbonation
is
the
strongest
of
any
trappist
beer
i
have
imbibed
that
word
courtesy
of
my
more
intelligent
wife
it
has
a
great
finish
and
leaves
a
very
nice
lingering
flavor
albeit
a
bit
dry
overall
considering
its
alcohol
strength
it
is
great
for
what
it
is
however
for
what
it
is
the
price
of
a
4pack
is
steep
i
do
hope
the
spencer
brewery
comes
out
with
other
brews
as
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
them
take
on
stronger
styles
spencer
trappist
ale
is
a
wellcrafted
rendition
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
that
had
many
similar
characteristics
to
a
stronger
belgian
ale
although
i
really
enjoyed
this
at
18
a
fourpack
i
doubt
i
will
be
drinking
it
very
often
pours
a
short
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
golden
orange
in
color
with
light
carbonation
smell
is
instantly
recognizable
as
trappist
with
a
lot
of
pepper
clove
and
rock
candy
taste
is
surprisingly
mellow
compared
to
what
the
nose
indicates
light
and
fluffy
with
a
just
touch
of
pepper
and
clove
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
the
body
doesnt
stick
around
long
overall
very
enjoyable
this
would
be
a
terrific
ale
to
sip
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
summer
night
however
the
price
point
makes
it
a
bit
more
of
an
occasional
indulgence
o
i
will
admit
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
there
is
nothing
really
that
stands
out
a
bit
too
dull
for
me
perhaps
a
better
brew
for
summer
or
to
pair
with
lighter
foods
feel
a
road
trip
coming
on
this
is
my
third
bottle
good
not
great
seems
to
me
like
it
wants
to
be
a
little
of
several
things
i
would
not
turn
one
down
but
nothing
really
makes
me
want
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
im
saving
the
last
one
for
a
hot
summer
day
maybe
some
time
to
develop
will
change
my
view
hopefully
for
the
better
from
the
first
batch
semi
rough
poor
kicked
up
a
one
finger
head
that
dissapated
shortly
after
being
poured
left
minimal
lacing
odd
aroma
of
dryer
sheets
and
dirt
with
a
bready
maltiness
flavor
falls
short
due
to
typical
for
us
brewers
of
belgian
styles
overly
phenolic
flavor
with
no
nuance
tastes
more
like
a
hefeweizen
than
belgian
single
made
me
feel
good
so
theres
that
at
least
value
is
out
of
whack
o
not
a
bad
brew
nothing
earth
shattering
but
this
is
just
a
6
5
bpa
its
fairly
simple
but
balanced
and
refreshing
lightly
hopped
crisp
citrus
pretty
standard
nice
and
fresh
which
is
nice
considering
the
brewerymonastery
is
a
whole
hour
from
me
quite
authentic
for
a
usbased
belgianstyle
beer
nice
copper
golden
color
with
soft
white
head
that
dissipates
quicker
than
i
would
wish
smell
of
faint
banana
some
clove
yeast
bread
taste
is
very
nice
clean
maltiness
bananas
clove
bread
belgian
yeast
very
nicely
balanced
very
soft
and
smooth
making
it
extremely
drinkable
not
extremely
complex
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
dry
aftertaste
made
me
want
to
keep
taking
sips
a
great
example
of
the
style
brought
me
back
to
belgium
for
sure
overall
this
is
decent
and
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
it
that
being
said
i
wished
it
was
a
bit
more
unique
tasting
good
beer
aroma
is
great
and
was
hoping
for
a
stronger
flavor
presence
its
gentle
mild
and
subtle
cheers
overall
quite
well
done
and
a
refreshing
beer
for
dinnertime
spicy
fruity
slightly
bitter
perfect
mealtime
beer

the
taste
evolves
from
a
toasted
biscuit
character
to
the
meaty
fruit
character
of
apples
and
pear
and
the
clove
creeps
on
the
back
end
to
top
it
all
very
nicely
done
and
reflects
well
on
the
original
trappist
ales
from
europe
odpretty
cool
you
definitely
pay
for
the
trappist
moniker
hey
long
live
the
masshole
trappists
golden
honey
color
light
head
and
slight
lacing
heavy
banana
nose
and
taste
fruit
notes
with
a
touch
of
spice
the
mouthfeel
gives
you
heavy
carbonation
up
front
with
velvet
finish
pleasant
aftertaste
with
an
almost
caramel
finish
split
a
bottle
with
threelions
overall
very
happy
with
this
selection
cant
wait
to
enjoy
the
last
3
bottles
the
beer
pours
a
white
and
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
very
slowly
the
beer
itself
is
a
golden
brown
that
resembles
a
dark
honey
the
beer
is
fairly
clear
with
a
bit
of
haze
in
it
the
smell
has
strong
bitter
hop
notes
along
with
citrus
fruits
such
lemon
and
orange
zest
the
bready
yeast
smell
also
has
a
presence
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
mixing
with
the
citrus
the
taste
is
slightly
different
from
the
smell
the
taste
a
stronger
bitter
hop
presence
and
the
citrus
flavors
are
not
as
pronounced
the
taste
also
has
that
bready
yeast
taste
medium
bodied
on
the
heavier
side
but
goes
down
fairly
smooth
biting
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
getting
this
poured
a
nice
darker
golden
color
with
a
small
head
and
lasting
lacing
nice
fruity
smell
was
encouraging
the
taste
was
very
clean
with
nice
balance
of
yeast
and
hops
what
stuck
out
was
the
carbonation
this
seemed
different
than
my
recollection
of
the
belgians
each
taste
though
is
so
good
cant
believe
these
guys
just
got
started
i
am
already
starting
my
plan
to
do
a
tour
there
i
heard
they
havent
planned
on
doing
tours
yet
so
may
result
in
a
late
night
kicking
in
the
door
no
matter
what
nice
job
20
for
a
4
pack
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
but
it
is
worth
it
o
i
have
seen
this
compared
to
duvel
but
i
found
it
superior
in
flavor
and
body
really
nice
to
see
something
of
this
quality
produced
an
hour
away
from
me
too
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
support
it
with
more
purchases
in
the
future
maxell
couldnt
be
further
from
the
truth
adjectives
do
no
justice
for
this
liquid
ambrosia
well
balanced
traditional
but
extremely
fresh
the
perks
of
being
in
ma
looking
forward
to
regular
consumption
o
overall
a
great
trappist
ale
i
put
another
four
pack
in
the
basement
to
see
if
the
flavors
change
or
develop
at
all
by
summer
the
beer
pours
a
deep
orange
with
amber
highlights
like
a
morning
sunrise
a
head
of
gentlyoffwhite
bubbles
forms
above
the
beer
settling
around
a
quarter
of
a
fingers
width
above
the
glass
and
then
quickly
fizzling
away
to
just
a
scrim
the
bubbles
leave
a
mildly
thick
lacing
that
draws
its
fingers
up
the
sides
of
my
glass
but
i
wish
they
would
stick
around
a
little
longer
in
body
the
beer
is
opaque
and
hazy
with
little
to
nothing
coming
through
from
the
other
side
of
the
glass
there
are
however
no
visible
particles
floating
around
within
the
beer
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
distinctly
of
trappist
origins
with
the
potential
to
also
be
considered
a
hefeweizen
big
fruity
esters
and
phenols
lather
the
nose
in
thick
banana
scents
like
a
banana
smoothie
hints
of
pineapple
can
also
be
sensed
and
touches
of
spicy
clove
and
other
phenols
can
be
felt
in
the
nostrils
subtle
bread
scents
do
dance
as
ghosts
in
the
background
of
the
nose
but
really
this
beer
is
all
about
the
fruity
esters
and
spicy
phenols
of
the
yeast
there
does
seem
to
be
a
touch
of
spicy
booze
as
well
which
may
just
be
me
mistaking
the
esters
for
booze
but
if
not
then
it
is
a
little
odd
for
the
abv
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
fruity
with
funky
esters
and
spicy
phenols
the
middle
and
finish
bring
in
a
nice
balancing
spicy
bitterness
that
mellows
into
herbal
hops
that
are
just
a
touch
strong
acidity
also
pops
the
mouth
in
the
beginnings
of
the
sip
leaving
a
light
pucker
in
the
lips
in
flavor
the
beer
is
again
all
about
its
yeast
character
spicy
banana
and
pineapple
smoothie
molds
into
rich
phenol
clove
spice
and
perhaps
just
a
touch
of
bandaid
the
finish
brings
out
more
herbal
spices
mingling
with
herbal
and
grassy
hops
to
give
the
beer
a
nice
balance
though
it
still
remains
a
touch
too
sweet
making
the
bitterness
and
spice
a
little
harsh
the
finish
is
a
little
quick
for
what
i
want
it
to
be
but
does
leave
a
nice
aftertaste
of
pineapple
and
banana
esters
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
rather
odd
in
body
it
is
somewhere
in
the
medium
range
with
a
touch
of
watery
thinness
at
its
close
but
in
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
with
a
touch
of
chewiness
as
well
there
is
a
tug
on
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
as
the
beer
passes
through
the
mouth
giving
the
beer
a
light
grip
and
the
acidity
certainly
bites
at
the
tongue
even
after
the
beer
has
left
leaving
the
cheeks
wet
with
spittle
and
the
tongue
slightly
numb
with
spice
and
bitters
the
mouthfeel
still
needs
a
little
work
in
my
humble
opinion
overall
i
am
intrigued
and
impressed
it
is
no
easy
task
to
simply
step
into
the
venerable
ranks
of
the
trappist
breweries
some
of
the
highest
rated
beers
in
the
world
come
from
these
breweries
but
i
believe
spencer
has
built
a
strong
foundation
to
quickly
catch
up
to
its
european
brethren
they
need
to
work
on
the
head
retention
of
the
beer
for
starters
and
the
mouthfeel
and
is
bit
off
which
hurts
the
beers
drinkability
though
it
does
make
it
ideal
for
pairing
with
food
i
also
would
like
less
harsh
spicebitters
from
the
yeast
and
hops
and
a
little
more
of
a
blending
of
the
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
characteristics
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
table
beer
either
as
its
abv
and
overall
body
are
a
bit
much
but
it
would
certainly
do
well
on
a
table
this
beer
is
excellent
however
and
i
am
just
nitpicking
because
it
is
joining
such
an
elite
class
of
breweries
this
is
a
fine
start
for
the
monks
in
spencer
ma
o
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
i
am
pleased
to
report
that
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
this
is
the
first
authentic
trappist
beer
made
in
america
and
its
simplicity
and
understated
complexity
perfectly
reflect
the
context
in
which
it
was
brewed
the
beer
just
exudes
a
sense
of
peace
and
tranquility
this
is
the
perfect
companion
to
a
simple
cheese
plate
a
nice
tame
brie
with
apple
or
pear
slices
drizzled
with
honey
and
a
slice
of
crusty
bread
sometimes
its
the
simple
things
in
life
that
are
the
most
rewarding
grabbed
a
four
pack
at
the
package
store
on
its
first
day
of
release
im
hoping
the
monks
will
have
it
for
sale
in
their
gift
shop
next
to
the
jellies
soon
a
high
quality
belgian
blonde
it
pours
with
a
nice
head
and
a
big
scent
of
bananas
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
the
malts
and
spices
are
blended
perfectly
this
ale
is
christmas
in
a
bottle
serve
it
with
fish
or
chicken
and
enjoy
overall
pretty
good
nothing
too
crazy
or
amazing
but
for
a
blonde
ale
pretty
nice
like
i
mentioned
before
i
have
been
waiting
a
very
long
time
for
this
and
its
finally
here
and
is
able
to
remind
me
of
being
in
belgium
so
a
nice
beer
at
that
very
drinkable
a
bit
too
wheaty
but
still
tasty
everything
well
balanced
a
nice
spring
or
summer
beer
for
sure
i
hope
they
bring
a
quad
or
big
beer
at
some
point
o
overall
this
comes
off
as
a
wellconstructed
but
poor
tasting
imo
example
of
a
beer
in
a
genre
which
is
admittedly
not
my
favorite
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
plus
but
taste
was
not
enjoyable
even
though
i
didnt
like
it
i
was
happy
to
help
out
the
locals
by
making
this
purchase
o
overall
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
an
easy
drinking
and
wildly
refreshing
trappist
ale
that
has
the
character
and
complexities
in
both
aroma
and
taste
to
stand
up
with
its
sister
beers
from
overseas
american
trappist
works
for
me
look
forward
to
seeking
this
one
out
when
its
in
retail
got
to
try
this
early
it
poured
the
color
of
hay
with
a
nice
clean
white
head
the
aroma
and
taste
were
what
you
would
expect
from
a
tripel
banana
clove
and
yeast
it
was
more
highly
carbonated
than
i
was
expecting
quite
prickly
on
the
tongue
it
was
easy
drinking
and
quite
refreshing
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
when
it
gets
released
in
just
over
a
week
dont
know
how
much
buzz
there
is
about
the
first
american
trappist
beer
but
the
monks
at
st
josephs
have
produced
a
swell
little
beer
here
brew
pours
a
goldenhoney
in
color
with
a
small
white
foamy
head
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
slides
back
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
along
with
some
light
fruit
maybe
pears
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
with
some
light
foral
hops
in
the
mix
also
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
lighter
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
brew
one
of
the
first
beers
that
got
me
to
really
enjoy
beer
i
moved
on
to
other
beer
but
i
will
always
think
fondly
of
this
beer
even
though
ive
realized
its
a
little
too
watery
for
my
current
tastes
ok
for
what
it
is
certainly
a
watery
forgettable
beer
nice
to
find
at
a
value
which
i
did
as
part
of
a
sumner
variety
pack
for
near
1
a
beer
has
an
ok
spice
presence
probably
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
beginners
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
solid
beer
but
nothing
too
special
there
are
probably
better
belgian
ales
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
at
least
try
once
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
has
a
lower
alcohol
content
for
the
style
which
is
appealing
to
me
but
there
are
better
belgian
ales
so
i
would
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
again
o
i
am
a
little
disappointed
the
smell
was
good
but
the
taste
was
lacking
i
expected
a
better
interpretation
from
the
boston
beer
company
belgian
session
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
with
an
abv
of
4
3
this
brew
pours
of
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
samuel
adams
belgian
session
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
thought
it
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
and
some
bitterness
so
far
this
brew
is
doing
well
now
for
the
taste
it
is
smooth
real
smooth
and
light
it
is
crisp
but
you
do
pick
up
on
some
spices
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
an
refreshing
and
clean
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
samuel
adams
did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
4
5
out
of
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
o
really
nice
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
single
bottle
from
a
mixed
pack
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
golden
honey
color
with
around
a
halfinch
of
firm
white
bubbly
head
rather
effervescent
brew
with
a
nice
look
aroma
is
unassuming
however
faintly
malty
with
a
little
brown
sugar
but
nothing
overly
robust
along
with
some
apple
and
a
pleasant
but
again
subtle
hop
spice
floral
and
citrus
notes
discernible
here
and
there
flavor
is
somewhat
more
robust
but
still
low
key
some
nice
brown
spice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
notes
flitting
in
and
out
breakfast
cereal
malts
and
tangy
faintly
floral
and
fruity
hops
very
downplayed
belgian
yeast
character
although
the
latter
is
certainly
present
does
develop
more
of
a
honeyed
sweetness
as
it
warms
i
get
the
notion
here
and
this
is
indeed
a
solid
sipper
to
session
out
on
the
deck
all
afternoon
no
real
offflavors
personally
i
am
not
afraid
of
more
aggressive
belgian
flavors
and
would
choose
a
belgian
pale
right
from
the
source
before
seeking
out
this
again
o
probably
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
id
almost
go
as
far
as
to
characterize
this
as
a
really
good
light
beer
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
boston
beer
was
going
for
here
its
a
really
meager
beer
but
it
has
no
unfavorable
flavors
or
notes
so
its
hard
to
call
it
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
make
it
a
good
beer
id
like
to
try
it
on
draft
with
a
hearty
meal
after
a
hard
days
work
thats
what
this
beer
is
made
for
a
light
belgian
as
billed
an
average
okay
belgian
session
belgian
session
is
a
very
good
beer
form
the
first
pour
it
has
a
strong
golden
color
and
aroma
that
is
inviting
for
the
first
sip
that
first
sip
is
not
going
to
disappoint
a
crisp
flavor
that
makes
this
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
summer
brew
i
used
a
pint
glass
and
it
hung
to
the
sides
nicely
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
any
summer
event
and
to
go
with
a
good
old
southern
bar
bq
o
nice
tasty
brew
has
high
drinkability
quotient
another
winner
from
sam
sam
adams
really
didnt
put
any
effort
into
this
beer
not
worth
getting
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
hint
of
some
cloves
i
think
there
is
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
of
a
citrus
hop
bite
a
slight
bit
of
fruit
notes
are
in
there
not
sure
which
ones
finishes
off
with
a
caramel
malt
smoothness
perfect
summer
sunday
afternoon
on
the
patio
beer
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
i
get
the
conceit
here
which
takes
or
precedes
i
dunno
the
idea
of
sessionability
from
the
ipa
world
and
applies
it
to
the
typically
boozy
belgian
strain
of
pale
ales
agreeable
enough
for
the
most
part
but
kind
of
plain
and
somewhat
boring
once
upon
bottoms
up
meh
maybe
its
time
to
admit
that
for
me
by
far
the
best
part
of
most
belgianstyle
ales
is
indeed
their
alcohol
quotient
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
drinkable
feel
that
us
smooth
but
does
kick
slightly
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
this
samuel
adams
beer
sam
adams
belgian
session
another
great
beer
from
the
micro
brewer
that
started
it
all
across
the
board
the
beer
is
simply
outstanding
a
great
mix
on
the
odor
of
the
beer
with
that
burnt
toffee
smell
to
go
with
the
hops
and
malts
the
taste
matched
the
smell
a
big
plus
for
me
and
was
smooth
and
crisp
going
down
the
only
knit
was
the
appearance
although
it
coloring
is
appealing
the
head
has
little
to
no
staying
power
otherwise
really
a
great
beer
came
out
of
left
field
when
i
got
the
summer
variety
pack
which
is
the
only
way
i
could
find
this
beer
i
wasnt
too
excited
by
this
beer
at
first
glance
but
it
turned
out
to
be
my
favorite
beer
in
the
pack
light
yellow
color
with
nice
head
the
smell
was
bananas
and
citrus
peel
the
taste
had
great
belgian
wheat
flavors
and
a
nice
clean
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
and
would
love
to
see
it
on
its
own
one
day
overall
ok
brew
not
my
first
choice
another
good
one
from
sa
overall
pretty
tasty
beer
considering
its
pretty
cheap
and
part
of
a
mix
pack
its
good
for
what
it
is
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
and
its
different
and
unique
but
the
taste
is
not
that
good
to
be
fair
i
hate
coriander
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
am
trying
to
branch
out
more
i
actually
expected
a
different
yeast
profile
that
is
typical
in
belgian
style
beers
this
is
more
like
belgian
for
people
who
really
dont
like
belgian
this
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
banana
and
lemon
the
texture
is
fairly
decent
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
about
the
taste
this
is
surprisingly
bland
and
simple
this
is
basically
an
extremely
thin
and
young
version
of
a
yeasty
belgian
ale
one
of
the
few
sam
adams
beer
that
i
can
honestly
say
could
use
some
work
my
100th
beer
review
love
this
beer
lots
of
taste
to
this
beer
not
the
best
but
the
toffee
sets
the
tone
for
this
beer
i
love
it
in
the
variety
packs
want
to
find
it
outside
the
v
paks
as
i
do
with
a
lot
of
sam
adams
beers
i
havent
seen
in
six
packs
but
i
guess
that
is
normal
since
boston
lager
was
my
first
delve
in
the
craft
world
o
this
was
too
much
of
one
note
pretty
meh
and
bland
i
will
not
have
it
again
bottle
poured
a
yellow
color
ale
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
belgian
style
malt
with
some
zesty
and
dry
hops
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
lightly
sweet
belgianstyle
malt
with
some
dry
and
zesty
hops
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
belgian
ale
with
a
little
hops
twist
o
a
decent
beer
from
sam
adams
the
fruity
belgian
notes
are
interesting
but
the
mouthfeel
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
is
a
session
beer
so
i
do
give
them
credit
for
that
overall
this
is
a
decent
little
beer
it
is
brewed
very
well
and
serves
as
a
perfect
beer
after
coming
in
from
a
100
degree
afternoon
in
phoenix
i
recommend
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decently
flavored
session
beer
o
not
bad
good
mix
of
flavors
as
it
goes
down
a
good
entry
to
the
belgian
style
without
being
to
overpowering
with
the
sweetness
or
alcohol
content
as
the
name
says
it
is
a
good
session
beer
and
nice
representation
of
a
belgian
beer
this
is
my
favorite
from
the
mix
pack
not
a
bad
shot
at
a
belgian
pale
ale
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
overall
light
tastes
light
alcohol
but
that
was
to
be
expected
t
apple
bready
malt
banana
lemon
citrus
even
a
hint
of
honey
not
bad
as
a
sessionable
belgian
beer
ive
had
better
but
sam
adams
makes
so
many
beers
but
this
wasnt
a
miss
its
not
great
but
it
wasnt
a
total
disappointment
i
read
that
some
thought
it
was
watered
but
i
didnt
get
that
effect
from
it
this
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
summer
variety
pack
this
would
be
good
to
get
the
foot
in
the
door
for
turning
someone
on
to
craft
beer
super
refreshing
with
a
lot
of
the
great
notes
that
belgians
are
known
for
but
not
as
in
your
face
good
summer
beer
not
sure
that
it
can
compete
with
many
other
belgian
pales
but
im
not
sure
that
its
really
supposed
to
id
drink
it
again
o
not
bad
as
a
sessionable
belgian
beer
the
flavors
are
light
but
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
its
just
a
bit
too
watered
down
which
diminishes
the
tasty
belgian
aspects
of
the
beer
o
this
beer
is
just
strange
and
awkward
it
never
really
seems
to
come
together
the
lack
of
assertive
malt
and
hop
flavors
allows
the
spicy
yeast
notes
to
become
overpowering
as
a
result
it
was
hard
for
me
to
determine
whether
i
was
supposed
to
treat
this
beer
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
as
a
saison
the
fact
that
the
carbonation
is
so
overthetop
also
prevents
this
beer
from
being
sessionable
instead
of
being
like
drinking
water
its
like
consuming
a
meal
in
a
bottle
all
in
all
the
brewers
at
samuel
adams
just
didnt
pull
it
off
with
this
one
in
fact
they
never
really
even
came
close
i
mean
what
is
the
point
of
brewing
a
session
beer
of
which
many
people
may
find
difficult
to
get
through
a
single
serving
o
not
bad
for
a
belgianpretty
typical
belgian
ales
just
arent
really
my
thing
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
probably
would
overlook
in
a
six
pack
to
get
a
better
belgian
but
i
wont
turn
it
down
in
the
mix
12
pack
i
bought
the
twelve
pack
warm
and
i
might
not
have
given
this
enough
time
to
truly
chill
i
got
impatient
d
disappointed
in
the
summer
sampler
boston
lager
saved
the
day
even
though
the
blueberry
hill
was
a
surprising
underdog
that
came
strong
for
the
win
porch
rocker
nix
that
shit
send
it
to
wherever
great
lakes
sent
grassroots
ale
this
one
isnt
horrible
so
i
wont
be
sending
jim
koch
any
mean
emails
this
year
overall
drinkable
but
pretty
plain
its
not
that
far
off
from
a
basic
lager
taste
wise
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
strawyellow
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
clingy
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
action
throughout
the
body
aromas
of
bread
and
butter
initially
with
floral
highlights
some
honey
sweetness
and
a
blend
of
coriander
clove
and
all
spice
flavors
of
caramel
in
the
backbone
with
a
roasted
grain
overlay
some
light
spicings
and
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
end
decent
cling
along
the
glass
and
the
body
is
light
and
bubbly
spiced
and
tangy
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
frothy
slightly
lingering
finish
pours
dark
golden
slight
amber
but
clear
and
pale
head
leaves
a
slight
ring
all
the
way
down
with
just
a
slight
lace
theres
not
much
more
then
just
a
generic
beer
smell
with
a
slight
yeast
spice
a
little
bubble
gum
yeast
and
thats
about
all
bitterness
comes
in
really
no
where
with
maybe
some
citrus
but
not
bitterness
from
the
hops
its
pretty
smooth
a
little
watery
but
it
is
a
session
beer
i
guess
i
think
its
decent
and
would
be
great
to
give
somone
with
not
much
beer
experience
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
tasteing
what
a
belgian
beer
should
taste
like
to
me
so
it
gets
a
ok
rateing
cold
12oz
bottle
best
before
december
served
in
pint
glass
beer
is
a
very
pale
amber
almost
yellow
color
with
a
medium
white
head
crystal
clear
with
only
a
few
bubbles
disturbing
its
clarity
aroma
is
pleasant
and
reminiscent
of
an
authentic
belgian
blonde
ale
sweet
candi
sugar
floral
yeast
notes
flavorwise
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
that
its
a
little
bit
spicy
but
only
a
very
little
bit
the
whole
thing
is
very
mild
and
the
carbonation
is
fine
and
low
yielding
an
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
which
works
pretty
well
with
the
mild
flavors
secondary
flavors
are
earthy
and
bitter
with
a
final
hint
of
something
fruity
is
belgian
session
the
lowest
abv
belgian
ale
in
the
books
no
not
quite
is
it
sessionable
quite
possibly
doesnt
seem
interesting
enough
to
bother
finding
out
based
on
this
one
its
ok
but
these
flavors
really
are
best
played
at
high
volume
onot
bad
a
gateway
to
other
belgian
ales
perhaps
i
think
they
could
use
a
name
upgrade
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
think
its
a
good
offering
from
samuel
adams
especially
for
summer
and
i
hope
it
becomes
a
permanent
summer
offering
o
i
understand
what
theyre
trying
to
do
but
it
doesnt
work
its
watered
down
to
make
it
sessionable
but
theres
just
not
enough
character
left
id
rather
session
an
american
pale
ale
kudos
for
trying
though
mouthfeel
nothing
substantial
to
report
the
beer
went
south
the
more
it
sat
in
the
glass
had
to
drink
it
quickly
tastes
a
little
yeasty
but
it
is
missing
something
taste
stays
in
your
mouth
a
bit
after
drinking
but
it
doesnt
make
a
memorable
impression
overall
a
serviceable
bekgian
style
ale
sessionable
and
flavorful
samuel
adams
describes
this
as
a
session
beer
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
is
milder
than
most
other
belgian
style
beers
and
its
taste
is
easier
going
than
what
you
anticipate
the
mildness
might
be
too
much
for
some
but
i
can
agree
that
this
beer
makes
a
good
choice
when
you
want
a
little
belgian
brew
but
want
something
a
little
tamer
than
the
norm
o
this
was
a
fairly
decent
beer
not
a
bad
thing
to
have
laying
around
for
the
summer
time
i
can
easily
drink
the
2
bottles
that
came
in
the
variety
pack
albeit
at
different
times
wouldnt
want
to
session
these
back
to
back
for
24oz
id
drink
this
beer
again
if
given
the
opportunity
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
i
often
find
it
hard
to
find
much
fault
in
a
session
and
this
is
no
different
the
taste
is
what
really
sells
me
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
take
this
to
a
summer
bbq
youll
score
some
points
with
the
ladies
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
compared
to
the
flavoring
this
aspect
was
a
bit
more
robust
in
the
end
giving
brighter
components
and
more
authentic
belgian
blend
actually
this
is
one
of
the
most
floral
beers
weve
ever
smelled
we
lost
points
through
the
taste
however
with
things
becoming
overly
watered
and
washed
out
by
the
end
of
the
sip
the
spice
and
fruity
yeastiness
was
there
in
the
start
but
faded
before
our
eyes
this
is
an
interesting
offering
from
sam
adams
and
certainly
an
attempt
to
keep
up
with
the
surge
of
new
styles
but
this
one
just
seems
a
bit
rushed
and
incomplete
this
is
exactly
what
it
aims
to
be
a
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
belgian
pale
and
it
does
an
excellent
job
its
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
and
has
enough
flavor
to
remain
interesting
very
well
balanced
i
would
buy
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
o
meh
its
alright
did
not
cater
to
my
expectations
for
a
belgian
style
beer
was
expecting
a
lot
more
yeast
but
yeah
not
that
great
not
horrendous
enough
for
me
to
never
drink
it
again
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
seek
it
out
summary
i
had
my
doubts
about
this
when
i
saw
the
belgian
on
the
label
of
a
sam
adams
product
i
like
a
bunch
of
their
stuff
but
a
belgian
is
difficult
to
do
correctly
it
seems
you
can
and
should
do
much
better
by
getting
something
else
i
suppose
you
could
get
it
as
an
entrylevel
idea
of
the
belgian
style
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
purpose
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
peppery
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
spicy
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
spicy
aromas
and
flavors
that
i
wasnt
expecting
o
not
impressed
sam
can
do
better
and
often
does
its
easy
to
get
shtfaced
drinking
belgians
this
however
provides
a
belgian
flavor
profile
with
a
lighter
abv
hence
the
session
label
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
taste
overall
mediocrity
overall
this
is
my
second
one
in
the
variety
summer
case
and
it
taste
like
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
a
full
flavored
belgium
pale
ale
with
a
session
able
abv
may
buy
this
again
overall
this
is
a
quick
review
because
its
a
quick
beer
solid
when
its
warm
out
and
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
belgian
its
certainly
not
better
than
the
bigger
belgian
brewerys
better
offerings
but
its
perfectly
acceptable
not
a
bad
brew
nothing
special
though
easy
enough
to
drink
with
a
light
belgian
character
o
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
belgian
for
the
summer
well
done
bbc
its
above
average
but
not
that
great

the
flavors
progress
across
the
palate
so
beautifully
i
could
write
it
like

i
did
unfortunately
that
lovely
flavor
train
breaks
down
into
a
dull
monotone
heap
a

mineralsteely
like
most
sa
ales
wish
that
aroma
translated
more
to
the
flavor
profile
carbonation
is
too
high
for
my
liking
and
really
shortens
the
flavor
enjoyment
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
clear
copper
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
there
are
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
this
beer
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
theres
a
lot
of
banana
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
lemon
i
also
pick
up
a
hint
of
spice
i
get
some
of
the
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
those
fruity
notes
in
the
nose
are
present
bringing
plenty
of
banana
and
lemon
the
party
along
with
the
solid
malt
backbone
the
clove
spice
is
there
as
well
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
the
beer
is
refreshing
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
aroma
offers
some
pleasant
yeast
notes
along
with
some
floral
and
lemony
hops
not
much
malt
depth
but
then
not
expected
given
the
abv
bit
hard
to
garner
overall
taste
follows
with
a
light
malt
character
and
a
flowery
spicy
finish
touch
of
harsh
grainy
bitterness
at
times
feel
is
adequate
for
the
beer
light
and
easy
with
enough
body
and
carbonation
to
match
the
delivery
not
watery
in
nature
but
not
far
from
it
either
drinkable
yet
simple
well
done
for
what
it
aims
to
be
refreshing
not
bad
for
what
it
is
i
prefer
my
bpas
a
bit
more
hoppy
stronger
but
could
do
a
few
of
these
any
time
of
the
year
overall
a
good
brew
to
sip
on
it
mellows
as
it
warms
while
still
tasty
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
golden
with
short
lived
thin
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
ripe
fruit
and
funky
yeast
body
is
medium
and
crisp
taste
is
of
spicy
hops
funky
yeast
and
fruit
finish
is
long
and
earthy
i
would
not
buy
this
brew
by
itself
served
in
growler
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
good
lacing
strong
clove
aroma
which
tends
to
be
a
trademark
of
sam
adams
taste
is
alot
like
smell
a
lot
of
cloves
and
a
hint
of
grass
and
almost
no
hops
not
very
complex
i
dont
really
like
the
flavor
not
much
there
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
sam
adams
belgian
session
and
i
am
sort
of
disappointed
maybe
these
summer
ales
are
not
supposed
to
be
strong
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
a
thick
head
to
start
the
quickly
turned
into
a
small
thin
head
it
does
bubble
up
after
sipping
and
the
head
dose
stay
but
its
a
thin
head
it
dose
have
a
citrus
taste
of
oranges
maybe
lemons
as
well
overall
it
wasnt
that
impressive
not
there
best
one
but
it
is
worth
trying
o
wow
this
is
a
muddled
mess
not
horrible
but
lacking
severely
in
so
many
areas
and
it
certainly
does
not
taste
belgian
sa
is
off
the
mark
on
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
long
ways
from
a
true
belgian
it
will
remind
you
of
a
belgian
but
falls
short
in
complexity
the
best
belgians
have
layers
of
flavor
this
one
is
more
one
note
and
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
it
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
warm
day
but
not
something
id
by
a
6
pack
of
either
i
served
it
in
a
tulip
glass
and
was
thinking
i
enjoyed
using
my
new
glass
more
than
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
definitely
doesnt
stand
out
on
its
own
even
if
i
am
not
trying
to
compare
it
to
other
beers
in
the
style
another
initial
review
harkening
back
to
a
previouslytasted
brew
this
time
one
that
brought
some
decent
joy
in
the
midst
of
a
lucky
monk
burger
on
the
patio
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
ripe
banana
flesh
light
clove
light
cinnamon
flowers
and
some
mildlybready
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
its
all
oerpowered
by
a
general
fruitiness
led
by
oranges
and
mild
lemons
part
of
me
wishes
the
flavors
echoed
the
smell
but
it
still
works
so
im
not
gonna
spend
too
much
time
fretting
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
that
borders
on
crispness
overall
an
enjoyable
little
taste
of
relativelylowabv
belgianness
i
could
easily
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
porches
and
patios
in
the
coming
warm
months
ive
had
this
beer
countless
times
and
cant
believe
that
i
am
bly
reviewing
it
now
it
is
a
clear
strawgold
color
its
smell
is
spicy
with
clove
and
bubblegum
lots
of
yeast
and
some
malt
scents
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
it
is
grass
and
haylike
drier
than
expected
malt
and
spice
dominate
the
flavor
the
finish
is
light
and
peppery
nice
modest
malty
taste
with
a
light
body
the
real
flavor
is
with
the
yeast
there
is
a
distinctive
clove
spiciness
just
like
a
hefeweizen
i
didnt
taste
any
banana
until
it
warmed
up
along
with
a
hint
of
orange
certainly
wellmade
in
the
lighter
style
though
i
got
tired
of
the
cloves
from
the
12
oz
bottle
now
albertsons
supermarket
in
san
diego
has
random
singles
to
make
up
six
packs
from
the
very
first
smell
reminded
me
immediately
of
a
leffe
and
this
made
me
quite
sad
however
the
smell
did
have
some
citrus
in
it
so
that
was
nice
the
taste
is
only
ok
when
it
was
cooler
the
banana
bubblegum
wheat
and
light
citrus
were
the
most
pronounced
then
as
it
warmed
the
floral
aspect
took
over
with
the
remaining
banana
and
there
was
a
slight
tangy
aftertaste
oddly
enough
the
taste
really
began
to
disappear
as
it
neared
room
temperature
i
would
not
get
this
again
overall
a
decent
brew
from
samuel
adams
imo
a
little
too
watery
but
the
flavor
is
respectable
decent
summer
brew
but
id
grab
the
firestonewalker
solace
10
times
out
of
10
over
this
o
interesting
attempt
by
the
boston
brewing
company
enjoyable
but
not
a
masterful
brew
pretty
mild
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
verry
sessionable
and
good
for
a
hot
day
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
coming
back
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
from
samuel
adams
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
color
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
decent
but
hardy
any
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
yeasty
there
is
some
citrus
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
bready
with
some
spicy
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
it
a
decent
beer
drinkable
dry
not
too
bad
o
a
solid
bpa
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
it
is
tasty
this
was
an
ok
beer
i
thought
there
could
have
been
more
to
the
flavor
o
this
truly
is
a
session
belgian
it
has
most
of
the
qualities
of
a
good
belgian
but
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
would
drink
again
but
wont
be
hunting
it
down
if
you
are
a
belgian
fan
and
want
a
beer
you
can
knock
down
this
is

tastefaintly

flavor
not
terrible
for
a
session
ale
but
much
better
examples
of
the
style
are
out
there
overall
actually
a
really
nice
beer
nothing
flashy
but
its
a
good
basic
beer
for
this
type
of
beer
o
as
its
name
implies
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
especially
given
its
low
alcohol
content
admittedly
more
enjoyable
than
what
i
expected
the
yeast
lends
nice
fruit
and
spice
notes
while
malts
balance
it
all
out
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
not
a
blast
of
flavor
but
i
think
it
delivers
what
they
advertise
here

the
beer
finished
very
clean
with
no

flavor
definately
a
session
beer
with

it
seemed
to
fall
short
to
me
on
flavor
overall
it
may
not

its
definitely
easy
to

i
dont

same
malts
a
bit
fruity
a
touch
of
spice
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
oan
average
belgian
pale
but
easily
drinkable
the
taste
does
not
come
on
as
strong
as
the
aroma
but
it
is
a
fascinating
array
of
smoky
malts
orange
peeland
low
hop
bitterness
but
in
the
end
it
is
entirely
drinkable
belgian
session
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
not
much
head
the
smell
is
sweet
lots
of
candy
aromas
with
strong
hints
of
banana
the
taste
has
nice
hints
of
the
belgian
candies
but
is
not
overpowering
and
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
taste
flavorful
yet
mild
overall
i
found
this
one
a
bit
different
but
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
dryness
after
each
sip
and
everything
blended
nicely
nothing
was
too
overpowering
served
a
bit
on
the
warm
side
but
it
still
worked
at
that
temperature
nothing
disagreeable
the
body
gave
the
quenching
feeling
of
cool
water
while
having
an
appropriate
thickness
a
little
simpler
than
id
hoped
might
be
more
interesting
colder
overall
not
a
bad
brew
pretty
interesting
to
think
about
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
from
the
samuel
adams
label
o
this
is
a
very
light
beer
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
prefer
this
over
the
summer
ale
for
the
hot
days
but
if
they
added
more
spiceflavor
it
may
bring
it
over
an
average
beer
overall
impression
fresh
light
and
straight
forward
nothing
extreme
but
solid
for
the
style
dont
know
why
it
hasnt
rated
better
here
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
gold
color
body
with
a
fizzy
head
that
quickly
disappears
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
swwet
and
spicy
at
the
same
time
the
taste
has
a
nice
spice
taste
up
front
then
it
has
a
sweet
taste
to
it
with
some
hops
coming
through
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
good
carbonation
and
overall
is
a
average
beer
but
a
good
summer
drinker
o
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
at
least
if
i
was
looking
for
something
light
and
sweet
could
use
a
heavier
flavor
deeper
spice
would
add
a
lot
certainly
good
for
the
summer
months
had
this
at
a
pool
party
nice
belgian
candy
sugar
sweetness
upfront
some
spiceness
and
phenols
as
well
had
that
yeasty
belgian
character
yet
clean
tasting
very
little
hop
prescence
very
refreshing
and
light
a
true
session
beer
and
perfect
for
a
summer
seasonal
another
seasonal
winner
from
koch
sam
adams
accomplished
what
they
were
going
for
this
is
a
nice
light
and
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
with
some
of
the
traditional
bpa
flavors
worth
a
try
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
as
part
of
the
summer
12
pack
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
taste
is
much
better
than
i
thought
after
the
sniff
test
i
get
more
of
the
malt
and
hop
flavor
than
much
contribution
from
any
yeast
esters
but
that
ends
up
being
just
fine
here
as
there
is
plenty
to
contemplate
all
the
while
it
maintains
an
excellent
refreshing
quality
the
hop
bitterness
is
low
and
the
body
light
but
there
is
a
certain
richness
that
is
quite
pleasing
even
though
i
disagree
with
the
first
half
of
the
name
they
have
come
up
with
for
this
beer
its
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
i
have
had
in
a
while
id
like
to
see
this
one
in
sixpacks
good
beer
bad
style
classification
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
fleeting
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
bubbly
sheet
sweetish
grain
lemon
mild
honey
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
aromas
grain
coriander
orange
pepper
and
light
phenolics
pretty
light
and
crisp
clean
and
spicy
with
some
sweet
floral
notes
not
too
shabby
really
simple
and
sessionable
enough
mouthfeel
this
is
a
rather
tasty
belgian
beer
in
my
mind
because
i
was
never
one
to
enjoy
the
over
powering
spice
and
yeast
flavors
that
most
belgian
give
off
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
and
very
easy
drinking
making
it
a
beautiful
session
beer
just
like
sam
adams
wanted
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
an
average
belgian
pale
ale
nose
is
very
nice
but
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
the
taste
is
just
a
lot
of
wheat
and
doesnt
have
as
much
as
the
nose
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
but
getting
2
in
a
mixed
12
pack
isnt
bad
and
not
a
problem
to
finish
onot
terrible
but
def
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
had
the
basic
characteristics
of
the
style
just
needed
a
bit
more
average
across
the
board
poured
gold
tinged
with
caramel
overall
reserved
in
the
belgian
yeast
profile
but
enough
to
provide
a
distinctive
belgian
character
funky
note
went
a
bit
medicinal
at
the
end
throwing
the
flavor
profile
out
of
whack
one
of
those
ill
drink
it
because
it
is
in
the
mix
pack
but
wont
buy
a
sixpack
sort
of
beers
this
is
a
decent
belgian
offering
from
sam
adams
it
has
decent
flavor
and
good
drinkability
it
wont
satisfy
the
hardcore
belgian
fans
but
it
will
introduce
a
few
more
people
to
a
wider
range
of
beers
taste
holds
in
line
with
the
aroma
sweet
and
spiced
with
a
light
herbal
hint
very
easy
to
drink
and
faithful
to
its
intents
as
a
belgianstyle
but
light
and
easygoing
a
winner
and
one
of
my
recent
sam
adams
faves
o
a
great
easy
going
introduction
to
a
good
craft
beer
for
macro
drinkers
definitely
a
session
beer
some
may
see
the
flavors
as
too
light
nice
addition
to
the
summer
12er
pours
hazy
but
bright
with
all
kinds
of
head
thick
and
tall
retaining
some
sediment
resting
smells
like
christmas
a
bit
gingersnap
cookies
on
the
malt
and
spice
and
dried
fruit
and
caramel
on
the
yeast
buttery
and
rich
but
light
and
drinkable
all
in
the
same
glass
flavor
is
all
yeast
bit
of
sweetness
and
spice
with
the
fruit
smells
long
gone
feel
work
thicker
for
a
session
brew
in
terms
of
body
but
very
lively
carbonation
make
it
down
easy
its
not
as
belgian
as
you
want
it
to
be
but
the
feel
is
there
just
seems
to
be
a
bit
weighty
for
a
session
overall
i
like
it
in
the
summer
box
good
with
food
on
the
grill
too
so
that
helps
not
belgian
quality
but
american
well
done
taste
seems
a
bit
watery
at
times
even
with
all
the
flavors
clove
tends
to
be
a
bit
much
although
the
orange
and
coriander
helps
assertive
high
carbonation
o
perfect
for
a
sams
sampler
pack
this
is
fun
to
try
one
enjoy
it
and
move
on
o
hard
to
see
how
this
would
be
sessionable
given
the
sweet
unbalanced
profile
hard
to
get
through
one
let
alone
trying
to
drink
several
pours
out
a
yellowish
orange
hue
with
a
thin
whitehead
that
has
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
and
some
nice
retention
it
has
an
aroma
of
wheat
yeast
citrus
and
spices
the
taste
starts
out
with
wheat
along
with
yeast
with
a
toffee
and
sweet
caramel
taste
in
the
back
and
finishes
off
with
hints
of
citrus
while
it
is
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
chewy
taste
that
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
overall
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
summer
day
i
do
hope
they
will
in
the
future
sell
this
is
6
and
12
packs
and
not
just
in
the
summer
sampler
package
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
nothing
remarkable
if
i
hadnt
taken
notes
i
would
not
have
remembered
it
but
not
every
beer
can
be
outstanding
i
would
drink
it
again
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
again
though
if
i
am
looking
for
a
pale
ale
i
think
i
will
stick
with
the
american
or
indian
styles
the
belgians
just
dont
do
it
for
me
as
much
worth
trying
though
notes
to
think
that
this
beer
is
the
same
style
as
orval
should
show
you
how
far
removed
from
that
level
of
greatness
that
this
beer
is
overall
sessionable
but
the
hop
character
is
muted
which
makes
this
one
more
red
or
amber
ale
like
than
session
hoppy
like
certainly
very
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
nice
session
ale
nice
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
the
hop
spices
play
off
it
well
a
good
light
option
overall
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
even
though
im
thirsty
after
a
day
of
labor
i
wouldnt
make
a
point
of
revisiting
this
o
not
exactly
was
i
was
expecting
flavors
of
spicy
and
then
the
flavor
just
seems
to
hit
a
bring
wall
and
stops
also
the
dryness
is
a
bit
more
then
i
anticipated
with
an
abv
as
low
as
this
one
not
a
terrible
beer
but
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
popping
the
top
yields
a
classic
belgian
smell
of
both
earthy
and
zesty
hops
and
a
very
sweet
maltiness
pours
to
a
orangeyellow
color
with
a
big
bubble
head
with
a
semi
creamy
top
taste
is
a
light
up
front
bitterness
immediately
followed
by
a
sweet
malty
banana
flavor
with
a
hint
of
clove
finish
is
a
transition
of
the
banana
flavor
to
a
zestier
sweetness
that
has
a
flat
bitterness
in
the
background
a
tasty
brew
that
is
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
flavors
without
being
as
lethal
as
your
typical
belgian
so
the
name
fits
part
of
a
case
with
6
different
sam
brews
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
it
has
all
the
qualities
that
a
belgian
pale
ale
should
have
but
theyre
just
watered
down
a
bit
too
much
to
give
this
a
higher
score
still
very
tasty
drinkable
and
totally
sessionable
this
came
in
the
summer
seasonal
pack
that
i
got
and
that
is
the
perfect
place
for
it
great
summer
session
beer
the
sessionish
youre
welcome
ding
nature
makes
it
drinkable
but
doesnt
lack
in
flavor
one
bit
very
well
done
sam
adams
o
it
was
a
fun
attempt
for
samuel
adams
but
not
particularly
well
executed
will
pass
on
it
in
the
future
d
very
drinkable
pretty
good
bpa
the
balance
is
pretty
good
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
pretty
average
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
seemed
like
this
beer
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
when
it
got
to
the
taste
it
ended
up
falling
a
little
flat
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
but
the
flavor
doesnt
do
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
one
or
two
till
i
would
want
something
different
and
more
flavorful
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
nice
and
fairly
true
to
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
slightly
bland
taste
it
seems
like
by
making
it
more
sessionable
they
lost
some
of
the
flavors
that
define
this
style
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
but
i
dont
dread
finding
this
in
the
summer
pack
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
an
awesome
belgian
pale
ale
in
the
end
i
just
wish
this
beer
came
together
better
if
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
it
would
be
a
solid
beer
but
the
focus
on
drinkability
takes
away
from
the
flavor
i
guess
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
but
i
didnt
hate
it
just
thought
it
could
be
better
executed
better
luck
next
time
guys
eric
this
beer
pours
out
an
orange
color
with
a
tiny
head
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
belgian
yeasts
the
taste
again
is
dominated
by
the
slightly
peppery
belgian
yeast
theres
some
bready
malts
and
wheat
on
the
finish
that
go
a
long
way
to
balance
things
out
along
with
a
light
touch
of
mild
hops
and
a
bit
of
citrus
too
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
the
drinkaility
is
actually
good
as
someone
whos
not
too
fond
of
bpas
this
one
is
pretty
solid
i
could
imagine
someone
who
cant
get
enough
of
that
peppery
yeast
being
let
down
but
its
just
enough
for
me
overall
pretty
good
certainly
nothing
outstanding
but
works
as
a
nice
light
session
ale
thats
very
easy
drinking
with
a
good
flavor
profile
a
good
addition
to
the
summer
mix
pack
i
hope
to
see
it
return
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
beer
a
very
refreshing
belgian
that
is
great
for
the
summer
time
an
awesome
selection
from
sam
adams
that
i
would
suggest
for
anyone
o
this
beer
is
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
seems
like
a
beer
that
is
intended
to
drive
bmc
drinkers
to
better
styles
of
beer
a
gateway
beer
i
might
try
this
one
again
but
not
anything
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
o
an
okay

nice
and
good
for
lunchtime
in
summer
with
a
relatively
low
abv
it
almost
seems
as
though
boston
beer
is
trying
to
make
a
bunch
of
beers
that
would
appeal
to
a
bud
light
drinker
gateway
beers
this
is
one
of
those
but
it
is
a
nice
easy
beer
to
have
for
refreshment
a
poor
candidate
for
aging
was
at
a
party
and
saw
these
in
bottles
so
have
out
a
try
and
was
pretty
impressed
poured
somewhat
amber
smell
was
rather
unimpressive
but
the
flavor
was
pretty
nice
with
soft
bubblegum
and
banana
notes
very
drinkable
and
great
for
the
warm
weather
i
will
revisit
this
overall
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
glad
i
got
to
try
it
with
the
summer
pack
nothing
outstanding
however
basically
your
average
summer
beer
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
its
pretty
soso
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
appreciate
its
session
strength
but
its
just
a
little
too
soapy
tasting
for
my
taste
the
beer
pours
a
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
fruity
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
lemon
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
some
yeast
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
nice
wheat
malt
backbone
with
some
grain
and
some
orange
also
present
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
straightforward
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
really
stands
out
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
beer
with
a
fluffy

the

never
describe

it
does
sacrifice

caramel
and
a
hint
of
lemon
from
the
hops
a
good
drinking
beer
overall
a
rather
interesting
beer
it
has
a
beautiful
look
and
smell
although
the
taste
is
a
little
too
peppery
for
me
while
it
is
peppery
it
is
still
very
drinkable
and
very
fitting
for
a
session
brew
pours
a
yellowish
orange
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
the
yeast
is
the
dominant
smell
with
some
banana
sweet
malt
and
citrus
notes
coming
through
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
subtle
pepperiness
that
starts
the
flavors
the
yeast
comes
through
in
the
middle
with
a
hint
of
lemon
but
the
sweet
malt
notes
round
out
the
end
of
the
beer
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
the
flavors
could
have
more
depth
and
a
better
mix
but
overall
the
beer
is
good
this
could
be
a
nice
intro
to
belgians
for
those
not
used
to
them
because
the
malt
comes
through
strong
at
the
end
to
balance
out
the
yeast
overall
a
decent
beer
not
one
that
i
would
buy
outright
but
a
nice
addition
to
the
summer
mix
pack
an
impressive
inclusion
in
the
summer
sampler
pack
although
my
girlfriend
picked
this
up
as
a
single
at
a
local
bottleshop
a
pleasant
surprise
if
they
fill
a
whole
case
with
this
stuff
at
a
reasonable
price
i
might
bite

o
not
too
bad
sort
of
an
americanized
belgian
pale
ale
the
flavors
are
good
and
as
the
name
says
it
is
sessionable
serving
type
ontap
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
lacks
a
solid
flavor
that
you
would
traditionally
hope
for
from
a
belgian
or
a
wheat
overall
basically
a
typical
yeasty
belgian
beer
what
was
really
nice
was
this
beer
was
extremely
flavorful
with
a
low
abv
making
it
a
great
session
brew
the
flavor
is
pretty
simple
it
isnt
bad
but
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
stands
out
it
does
fit
the
bill
as
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
afternoon
but
i
really
wouldnt
remember
much
from
the
experience
overall
not
too
shabby
the
name
says
it
all
its
a
simple
belgian
pale
ale
definitely
a
welcome
session
beer
nothing
special
aroma
is
very
promising
but
flavor
is
disappointing
overall
not
the
best
bpa
but
definitely
not
the
worst
it
is
great
for
the
buy
which
i
grabbed
in
a
sam
adams
variety
case
try
it
for
yourself
salud
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
say
that
with
a
bit
of
surprise
smooth
and
drinkable
a
good
belgian
ale
o
i
think
they
succeeded
in
creating
what
they
intended
this
is
an
easy
drinking
belgianstyle
ale
unfortunately
the
flavors
are
light
and
not
assertive
an
appropriate
addition
to
the
summer
pack
however
overall
its
a
good
summer
mix
brew
but
i
would
never
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
were
it
available
just
not
enough
flavor
the
harpoon
version
has
a
lot
more
punch
to
it
o
i
didnt
like
the
tart
level
of
the
beer
just
a
tad
too
much
for
this
soft
tasting
brew
overall
it
tasted
alright
to
me
i
got
a
general
belgian
yeast
flavor
throughout
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
a
few
of
so
not
bad
but
nothing
great
to
me
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
light
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
grainy
and
the
slight
mineraly
nickley
quality
shaves
some
points
as
well
rjt
o
pretty
refreshing
overall
session
is
not
my
most
familiar
variety
but
im
sure
ive
had
better
regardless
great
for
a
warm
summer
in
the
sun
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
best
by
august
pours
a
clear
yellow
orange
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lacing
smell
is
banana
clove
bread
pepper
and
grass
taste
is
lots
of
clove
and
banana
with
some
pepper
in
the
finish
body
is
what
you
would
expect
from
the
name
nice
carbonation
little
dry
and
drinkable
this
is
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
but
for
me
it
was
pleasant
and
perfect
for
the
summer
mix
12
this
thing
knocks
the
socks
off
of
stella
and
has
a
lower
abv
a
really
nice
bpa
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
and
still
remember
your
name
not
the
most
flavorful
belgian
but
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
of
these
in
the
market
looked
and
smelled
good
but
theres
nothing
to
taste
o
after
the
look
and
smell
this
certainly
goes
downhill
in
terms
of
being
a
belgian
pale
the
taste
has
way
too
much
bread
and
buttery
malty
notes
and
not
enough
of
the
yeasty
umph
that
belgians
usually
have
the
feel
is
also
off
most
likely
from
the
lack
of
bottle
conditioning
at
least
its
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
just
not
really
to
style
aside
from
the
nose

overall
this
beer
is
not
what
i
expected
at
all
but
generally
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
could
be
just
a
bit
sweeter
but
it
really
doesnt
need
to
be
its
just
my
preference
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
i
recommend
it
as
long
as
you
like
spiced
beers
o
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
and
i
could
drink
many
more
of
these
by
itself
it
is
worth
picking
up
the
summer
sampler
nice
brew
boston
beer
co
infinitely
better
than
any
moon
beers
overall
one
of
the
better
crafted
and
more
flavorful
sam
adams
beers
ive
sampled
jim
and
gang
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
its
definitely
a
step
up
from
many
of
their
other
bland
offerings
im
a
sucker
for
anything
new
from
the
pseudo
craft
brewery
belgian
session
is
a
great
addition
to
the
summer
mixed
pack
finally
they
eliminated
sam
adams
light
poured
into
my
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
nice
head
and
light
color
by
sight
you
can
tell
this
is
going
to
be
a
delicate
tasting
beer
and
when
it
hits
the
taste
buds
thats
exactly
what
it
is
very
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
citrus
obviously
this
beer
is
sessionable
its
in
the
name
but
it
really
would
get
quite
boring
after
more
than
two
of
these
nevertheless
still
a
great
beer
for
the
warmer
days
of
summer
not
offensive
but
not
mind
blowing
either
thats
sort
of
the
boston
beer
companys
creed
its
a
take
on
a
bpa
i
get
that
with
the
first
sip
but
its
like
orval
light
only
hints
of
that
classic
belgian
character
makes
it
into
this
summer
variety
pack
sam
adams
offering
i
can
actually
deal
with
that
because
i
understand
what
their
doing
making
a
session
version
of
a
beer
like
that
with
some
of
the
flavor
profile
appealing
pour
wtih
a
pale
copper
body
bright
white
head
forms
thin
speckled
lacing
across
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aroma
has
some
spicy
yeast
components
citric
with
herbal
mint
and
a
bit
of
underlying
ripened
fruit
tones
flavor
wise
pretty
enjoyable
light
bodied
spicy
phenolic
character
hints
of
pepper
ripe
fruit
with
minimal
sweetness
finishes
rather
dry
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
light
aspect
with
hints
of
lingering
spiciness
effervescent
carbonation
for
an
american
bpa
i
get
what
theyre
doing
and
i
actually
enjoy
this
not
something
id
buy
in
number
but
an
interesting
beer
to
break
down
theres
a
bit
more
going
on
than
your
average
new
beer
addition
o
i
love
the
attempt
at
this
style
i
homebrew
this
style
from
time
to
time
and
really
enjoy
it
sam
adams
did
right
with
the
phenolic
profile
i
would
like
it
to
be
dryer
than
it
is
either
with
a
higher
attennuative
yeast
or
more
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
i
would
buy
this
in
a
sixer
if
it
was
available
overall
a
solid
if
underwhelming
belgian
pale
ale
not
quite
a
dud
but
its
the
least
interesting
in
this
years
summer
mix
o
this
beer
wasnt
bad
however
it
could
have
used
a
lot
more
flavor
it
tasted
more
like
carbonated
water
with
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
flavor
more
then
anything
was
definitely
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
not
a
bad
beer
in
a
mixed
12
though
easily
sessionable
the
sam
summer
styles
case
caught
my
eye
when
i
saw
this
belgian
session
was
inside
and
it
was
on
sale
for
12
99
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
decent
collar
but
faded
fairly
fast
classic
cloudy
light
maple
coloring
great
nose
with
the
textbook
yeasty
biscuit
aroma
of
the
belgian
style
a
nice
mix
of
spices
perhaps
some
cinnamon
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
in
the
abv
but
maybe
im
just
ued
to
this
style
being
potent
overall
a
good
brew
a
shame
the
pack
only
came
with
2
prost
not
too
shabby
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
first
basic
belgian
pale
ales
i
had
in
my
early
beer
geek
days
no
frills
but
its
got
some
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
wish
it
was
a
tad
bit
cleaner
on
the
finish
though
simply
amazing
beer
well
done

very
nice
dark

and
nice
thick

head
aromas
included
citrus
raspberries
yeast
and
hops
excellent
taste
matched
the
sweet
aromas
and
included
a
nice
dry
finish
smooth
strong
and
pleasant
going
down
over
all
excellent
beer
heavy
carbonation
and
the
sour
peppery
flavors
make
this
a
craveable
trappist
ale
at
around
5
this
beer
is
worth
every
penny
although
i
had
a
wrong
preconception
that
this
is
another
fine
classic
belgian
ale
the
funk
this
beer
gives
made
it
one
of
my
favourite
belgians
and
beyond
that
style
mensjournal100best2014
not
bad
heavy
carbonation
like
a
volcano
musty
smell
light
citrus
bread
taste
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
extremely
carbonated
and
does
a
hell
of
an
old
faithful
impression
im
glad
its
on
the
lighter
side
and
wont
stain
its
got
a
strong
tart
flavor
that
mellows
out
later
but
its
followed
by
a
nice
lingering
orange
and
bitter
citrus
finish
im
not
the
biggest
belgian
fan
out
there
but
its
worth
the
money
very
tart
musty
nose
followed
by
a
grassy
dry
flavor
with
spikes
of
bitter
citrus
finishes
clean
heavy
on
the
yeast
but
brings
a
lot
of
flavors
to
the
mix
outstanding
lighter
than
expected
definitely
a
good
one
i
like
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
overall
honestly
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
and
definitely
didnt
anticipate
the
brett
aspect
funky
barnyard
beers
usually
arent
up
my
alley
but
this
strikes
a
good
balance
with
some
funk
upfront
but
fading
to
citrus
and
caramel
combine
for
a
crisp
finish
good
beer
in
my
book
and
worth
trying
again
but
this
would
probably
be
more
enjoyed
by
those
who
like
brett
influenced
beers
extremely
pleasant
beer
with
amazing
evolution
in
tastes
throughout
wasnt
up
my
alley
not
horrible
though
beer
was
ok
but
the
price
was
a
little
high
classic
friggin
awesome
i
know
that
this
review
doesnt
describe
my
experience
of
the
beer
but
this
is
a
great
trappist
ale
its
a
solid
beer
top
beer
like
a
cherry
in
the
sky
o
i
really
wonder
what
my
2011
bottle
will
taste
like
next
year
this
is
just
a
brilliant
beer
and
i
really
want
to
do
a
vertical
of
it
now

finish
with
soft

the

is

and
even
better
as
it
ages
very
nice
belgium
pale
ale
had
out
of

overall
the
flavor
was
not
what
i
expected
however
the
craftsmanship
of
this
beer
is
admirable
i
might
have
to
age
one
and
try
it
again
unfortunately
the
flavor
profile
isnt
as
impressive
as
the
appearance
or
the
aroma
it
is
intense
lacks
complexity
and
is
poorly
balanced
from
the
onset
phenols
dominate
and
little
else
comes
forward
in
the
middle
a
bit
of
biscuit
sweetness
is
underneath
but
you
really
have
to
look
for
it
the
finish
is
dry
first
trappist
very
good
all
around
very
good
beer
unique
and
in
a
good
way
this
one
was
bottled
about
10
months
ago
and
can
be
cellared

would
like
to
see
how
it

classic

golden

suggesting
the
distinctive
yeasty

caramelized

but
this
beer
is
both
more
dry
and
more
tart
than
others
in
its
category
bpa
it
has
a
really
crisp
thin
mouthfeel
surprising
for
a
beer
as
high
og
as
this
the
bottle
conditioning
has
left
this
beer
highly
carbonated
which
works
well
with
the
subtle
tartness
its
almost
like
a
mild

even

this
beer

although
that
figure
may
assume
a
large
amount
of
fermentation
happening
in

doesnt

at
all
however
being

i
do
find
it
a

bland
for

taste

pervade
the
nose
and
initial
taste
here
this
is
edging
towards
the
sour
end
of
the
spectrum
the
initial
bottle
pour
unloads
a
vast
foamy
head
that
settles
into
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
looking
toned
ale
this
is
a
peculiar
one
though
i
cant
say
i
dislike
it
its
certainly
interestingcrisp
flavorful
tart
somewhat
fruity
and
sweet
the
brett
though
just
makes
me
think
of
latex
and
while
it
adds
a
unique
dimension
to
the
beer
its
taking
some
getting
used
to
overall
perfectly
drinkable
for
trying
a
different
taste
but
too
spicy
for
me
looks
can
sometime
be
deceiving
not
impressed
after
all
the
hype
because
ba
made
me
write
something
to
submit
my
ranking
large

amazing

also
very

a

very

cannot
wait
to
drink
again
o
deserving
of
more
samplings
this
is
my
third
tasting
of
it
and
i
cant
quite
nail
whats
going
on
exactly
possibly
due
to
the
widely
ranging
freshness
of
my
bottles
definitely
a
good
quality
brew
but
i
think
the
coolest
aspect
of
it
is
bound
to
be
the
history
not
the
taste
maybe
it
is
my
privileged
21st
century
palate
or
my
overworkeddulled
21st

palate
but
as
good
as
this

is
i

the

bitterness
lightly
tart
and
earthy
medium
bodied
with
sharp
peppery
carbonation
a
very
distinctive
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
unique
wild
yeast
component
i
did
not
like
this
when
i
first
tried
it
many
years
ago
but
now
having
grown
to
enjoy
saison
yeasts
and
a
light
touch
of
wild
yeast
i
can
see
its
appeal
although
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
funky
yeast
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
light
and
subtle
fruit
and
spice
flavors
in
the
background
a
bit
too
dry
and
funky
to
be
a
frequent
choice
it
was
a
pleasure
drinking
this
again
and
understanding
why
it
is
a
classic
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
huge
three
finger
off
white
foamy
head
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
odor
is
powerful
spices
cardamom
coriander
bread
like
fruity
apple
pear
citrus
lemon
and
malty
the
taste
is
crisp
spices
clove
coriander
pine
a
little
bit
of
apple
grassy
bread
like
yeasty
there
is
some
bitterness
on
the
end
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
when
you
poor
the
beer
into
its
glass
its
an
orangeesque
hue
yet
its
first
tastes
are
one
of
a
darker
beer
but
as
you
exhale
you
can
taste
the
hops
man
its
one
of
those
beers
you
have
to
try
in
your
life
time
love
it
overall
just
dont
get
this
one
and
i
get
a
lot
of
things
will
wait
another
35
years
before
trying
again
or
maybe
not
if
i
was
on
a
beach
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
this
choice
was
warm
orval
or
warm
bud
i
would
take
the
orval
but
under
no
other
circumstances
i
dont
know
why
despite
being
into
craft
beer
for
over
14
years
i
never
tried
orval
i
am
so
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
it
doesnt
dethrone
duvel
as
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
is
a
worthy
brew
in
any
estimation
tastes
bitter
has
a
refreshing
touch
yeast
with
a
sweeter
finish
carbonation
is
pretty
high
but
not
too
present
has
a
warm
pleasant
finish
gets
into
balance
in
the
end
less
bitterness
smells
much
sweeter
than
it
actually
tastes
bitterness
is
very
present
at
the
beginning
sweet
yeast
and
spices
add
complexity
which
results
in
a
very
adorable
mouthfeel
this
is
based
on
a
5
month
old
bottle
but
try
it
aged
by
a
few
years
for
an
even
more
unique
orval
experience
i
tried
this
one
on
a
whim
and
ended
up
loving
it
unlike
almost
any
ale
ive
had
smooth
flavorful
well
balanced
not
too
heavy
but
substantial
all
the
same
i
do
recommend
as
the
brothers
do
that
you
cellar
this
one
for
at
least
a
couple
weeks
before
opening
enjoy
chilled
and
in
a
frosty
glass
huge
foamy
pour
nets
5
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
head
falls
slowly
to
a
skimcoat
without
leaving
any
lacing
a
rusty
golden
hue
is
slightly
cloudy
the
aroma
is
distinctive
with
sour
apple
medicinal
spicy
belgian
funk
fruity
and
some
lemony
notes
the
taste
follows
with
the
belgian
funk
and
medicinal
fruit
bandaid
also
tart
then
ending
with
a
surprising
bitterness
not
sure
if
its
from
lots
of
hops
though
maybe
the
yeast
very
unique
taste
effervescent
crisp
light
and
refreshing
i
was
surprised
by
the
drinkability
this
went
down
the
gullet
quickly
i
tried
this
beer
in
the
1980s
and
poured
it
i
liked
chimay
but
thought
the
orval
went
bad
nowadays
i
fully
appreciate
unique
belgian
flavors
this
reminds
me
of
rayon
vert
which
is
good
o
this
is
a
very
fresh
bright
spritzy
spring
time
in
the
hills
type
beer
i
really
love
the
aromas
but
the
rest
is
not
at
the
same
level
a
true
trappist
beer
so
it
meets
expectations
and
is
very
well
crafted
but
i
dont
think
its
the
best
of
that
group
still
a
fantastic
beer
its
all
relative

i
am
going

try
cellaring
a

of
these
bottles
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
changes
o
this
is
very
good
ale
for
its
type
and
will
be
a
winner
with
those
who
like
belgian
pale
ales
i
must
confess
to
not
being
a
massive
fan
of
this
one
myself
but
it
is
doing
what
it
set
out
to
do
and
it
is
doing
it
well
therefore
i
have
to
give
it
a
mark
to
reflect
that
caveat
i
drank
this
while
reading
about
the
abbey
and
the
legend
of
matilda
of
tuscany
so
my
experience
may
have
been
artificially
enhanced

the
only
thing
about
this

i
did
not
like
was
the
massive

i
got
from

overall
really
enjoyed
this
feel
like
its
a
staple
for
the
belgian

i
took
far
too
long
to
finish
this
one
caveat
emptor
dirty
pear
burps
will
haunt
you
later
pours
a
hazy
orange
the
head
is
intense
previous
reviews
of
a
stout
head
is
understated
tried
to
control
the
pour
to
limit
head
but
to
no
avail
45s
of
the
glass
was
full
of
a
thick
slow
eroding
head
the
nose
was
of
orange
and
lemon
candy
smelled
delicious
btw
the
head
still
remains
with
impressive
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
sure
how
to
describe
it
malty
and
boozy
the
finish
was
super
dry
like
a
bourbon
very
good
only
wish
i
had
another
one
the
best
example
of
a
mild
belgian
pale
that
i
have
ever
tried
no
other
attempts
come
close
expensive
so
i
only
have
a
few
a
year
but
so
good
incredibly
unique
a
style
unto
itself
you
can
taste
the
grains
the
brew
equipment
and
environment
the
thousand
year
old
tradition
would
buy
this
again
to
treat
myself
or
to
open
someones
eyes
to
one
of
the
worlds
most
revered
beers
how
do
you
rate
a
beer
in
a
style
you
dont
care
for
this
is
very
well
made
very
balanced
not
funky
or
offensive
the
head
is
massive
and
sticks
to
the
glass
impressively
its
cloudy
medium
amber
in
color
nutmeg
and
wet
earth
on
the
nose
with
a
yeasty
bread
behind
it
the
taste
has
more
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
and
a
light
overripe
fruit
taste
finishes
rather
dry
not
at
all
sweet
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
a
great
example
of
a
style
i
dont
love
overall
this
is
a
perfect
classic
overall
i
purchased
this
trappist
ale
expecting
to
be
impressed
and
i
was
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
a
little
closure
to
its
origin
two
of
these
and
i
could
see
myself
considering
the
monastic
life
for
reasons
unknown
i
chose
to
drink
this
beer
on
my
31st
birthday
and
couldnt
be
happier
a
total
classic
in
every
sense
of
the
word
ho
hum
another
unexciting
belgium
pale
ale
at
least
it
meets
the
criteria
well
15
or
twenty
minutes
in
i
find
myself
enjoying
it
though
i
would
like
that
hint
of
sweetness
which
i
find
adds
a
different
measure
of
complexity
as
opposed
to
the
sour
yawning
complexity
of
this
unusual
different
animal
so
yes
like
after
said
floozy
that
offered
to
pay
for
dinner
raul
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
one
again
and
again
this
is
a
journey
of
a
beer
o
not
really
anything
great
about
this
beer
its
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
with
the
brett
coming
more
as
stale
basement
funk
than
anything
exciting
and
interesting
between
light
oxidation
faded
hops
and
the
yeast
derived
flavors
the
overwhelming
characteristic
is
stale
pours
beautiful
golden
brown
pillowy
3
fingers
of
head
that
is
persistent
and
leaves
a
spotty
lace
on
the
drink
down
nose
is
not
overly
assertive
bready
notes
belgian
yeast
prevalent
my
first
thought
was
that
it
was
pretty
boozy
for
a
6
9
beer
but
i
think
the
extremely
dry
finish
contributed
to
that
really
clean
taste
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
if
that
makes
sense
bitterness
throughout
the
drink
makes
it
enjoyable
after
it
warmed
a
few
degrees
im
starting
to
think
that
i
wish
this
wasnt
so
expensive
because
it
could
be
session
material
easy
to
drink
lots
of
carbonation
good
summer
front
porcher
drinkability
its
a
very
smooths
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
good
flavors
and
aromas
a
good
beer
for
the
purist
very
simple
flavor
and
enjoyable
i
may
try
again
from
a
different
source
as
my
experience
is
clearly
not
in
line
with
many
others
though
very
good
i
fail
to
see
this
beer
as
being
anything
tremendously
special
o
great
beer
very
unique
and
interesting
over
carbonated
i
took
the
cap
off
and
heard
a
noisy
champagnelike
blop
the
head
is
a
big
allovertheplace
cloud
smells
like
a
cigar
butt
that
has
been
floating
in
a
beer
it
has
other
strong
flowery
aroma
but
not
a
good
one
flavor
is
very
bitter
with
a
really
dry
aftertaste
i
got
my
first
review
straight
from
a
belgian
store
shipped
from
belgium
i
got
my
2nd
one
from
a
local
liquor
store
in
miami
the
bottle
is
awesome
but
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
beer
o
4
25
i
wasnt
sure
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
at
first
but
i
came
to
really
enjoy
the
funk
and
dryness
it
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
character
pours
a
nice
crisp
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
massive
billowy
cloudy
head
that
will
not
die
and
eventually
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
nose
starts
with
some
sweet
malt
orange
peel
tart
lemon
and
musty
yeast
on
the
palate
the
beer
opens
up
further
and
is
much
drier
than
the
nose
with
lemon
peel
and
a
slight
tart
funkiness
to
round
it
all
out
the
taste
finishes
with
a
pleasant
floral
hop
bitterness
orval
is
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
very
subtle
and
nuanced
and
stands
apart
from
manymost
of
the
other
trappists
just
a
great
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
root
beer
float
head
that
lasts
for
days
tons
of
carbonation
nice
aroma
of
fruit
hay
and
a
touch
of
funk
tastes
of
grapes
apples
and
yeast
the
brett
adds
a
lot
medium
light
mouth
with
some
crispness
just
a
very
flavorful
and
wellbalanced
beer
overall
extremely
balanced
complex
and
drinkable
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
shows
that
a
beer
can
have
lots
of
flavor
without
being
hops
dominant
oh
dear
not
a
very
enjoyable
glassful
i
guess
this
hasnt
aged
well
or
ive
kept
it
for
too
long
probably
both
looks
great
and
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
complex
with
hints
of
brett
and
fruity
notes
however
the
flavour
is
deeply
unpleasant
very
harsh
and
dry
with
little
of
what
youd
expect
from
a
good
beer
body
is
also
subpar
fizzy
and
too
thin
a
great
pity
as
ive
really
enjoyed
orval
when
ive
had
it
before
and
was
looking
forward
to
a
top
notch
brew
most
likely
its
just
too
old
ill
try
and
rereview
a
fresher
version
when
i
get
the
chance
oh
well
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
fabulous
head
the
smell
is
fantastic
at
first
it
smells
like
bubblegum
fruity
fragrant
wonderful
slight
champagne
smell
tastes
very
good
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
not
your
typical
beer
and
definitely
not
your
typical
belgium
beer
great
overall

this
beer
is
always
an
experience
because
i
swear
its
different
every
time
i
drink
it
and
every
time
its
delicious
some
common
currents
between
all
experiences
lightly
tart
fruitiness
vinous
character
minerality
hay
and
must
clean
phenolic
funk
and
light
spice
occasionally
its
surprisingly
hoppy
occasionally
the
musty
character
is
very
pronounced
occasionally
the
spice
and
phenols
are
greater
occasionally
the
tartness
is
much
greater
and
occasionally
the
head
is
absolutely
out
of
control
but
every
timeincluding
this
timeits
delicious
its
easy
to
scoff
at
the
price
for
a
single
but
given
the
quality
of
the
beer
its
always
worth
buying
at
least
every
once
in
a
while
ofirst
time
having
this
beer
quite
the
standard
for
belgium
pale
ale
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
booming
3
finger
white
head
the
smell
is
a
light
earthy
aroma
with
an
authentic
belgian
spice
my
first
sip
of
this
started
with
a
fantastic
tart
and
spiciness
upfront
hat
literally
explodes
on
the
tongue
with
the
fantastic
carbonation
there
are
some
funky
notes
in
there
also
but
every
note
plays
off
each
other
so
well
it
leaves
me
wanting
another
sip
halfway
through
the
head
is
still
a
good
cm
and
resembles
construction
foam
the
taste
becomes
increasingly
spicy
and
funky
notes
of
fresh
grass
lemon
and
spicy
banana
what
an
incredible
beer
i
get
it
now
edit
with
the
hype
about
this
beer
from
truly
knowledgeable
folks
in
the
beer
industry
i
could
not
believe
that
i
had
such
a
bad
experience
to
cause
the
review
above
i
stand
by
that
review
and
now
attribute
it
to
a
bad
or
very
old
bottle
due
to
my
disbelief
i
decided
to
give
it
another
try
this
time
the
bottle
was
labelled
differently
with
a
manufactured
date
almost
two
years
old
and
a
best
by
date
almost
two
years
in
the
future
that
puts
this
bottle
right
in
the
sweet
spot
this
time
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
beer
and
i
see
why
it
is
so
highly
regarded
my
numbers
are
readjusted
to
reflect
the
second
tasting
first
sip
is
an
eye
opener
sharp
concentrated
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
that
goes
for
a
victory
lap
on
the
palate
lots
of
yeasty
esters
and
an
effervescence
that
coats
your
mouth
theres
some
slight
sour
and
funky
notes
that
hang
around
and
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
incredibly
complex
i
see
why
this
beer
has
such
a
reputation
and
aura
around
it
o
fantastic
brew
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
for
a
loooong
time
i
will
buy
more
ifwhen
i
see
it
forceful
carbonation
almost
popped
the
cap
off
when
i
went
to
open
it
it
pours
murky
orange
with
a
huge
fourfinger
head
of
white
foam
and
theres
still
carbonation
streaming
up
the
glass
the
nose
is
bready
tangy
and
full
of
brett
yeast
bringing
barnyard
funk
and
a
woodsy
characteristic
it
smells
unlike
any
other
trappist
ale
i
know
of
coming
across
like
a
highquality
sour
in
past
tastings
i
got
a
lot
of
spice
from
the
yeast
but
i
get
none
of
that
here
theres
a
slight
sourness
and
a
seriously
oaky
earthy
quality
with
more
of
that
barnyard
flavor
it
finishes
dry
and
vinous
like
a
white
wine
the
body
on
it
is
pretty
light
this
is
fantastic
aged
but
i
was
bit
impressed
with
it
fresh
i
honestly
had
written
it
off
as
a
standard
belgian
ale
dont
make
the
same
mistake
overall
terrific
brew
a
real
masterpiece
this
certainly
earns
its
ranking
as
the
yardstick
by
which
all
trappist
ales
are
measured
brett
bottle
conditioning
an
excellent
idea
no
wonder
i
rated
this
5
at
first
its
absolutely
amazing
minus
the
bit
of
extra

still

taste

o
this
is
my
third
time
having
orval
and
i
have
yet
to
truly
enjoy
it
to
the
level
that
i
have
other
trappist
beers
that
isnt
to
say
it
is
bad
far
from
it
but
rather
it
is
so
different
from
what
one
might
expect
from
a
trappist
beer
this
bottle
had
a
year
of
age
on
it
i
would
like
to
wait
and
try
the
next
in
another
year
i
am
very
glad
i
tried
it
o
probably
my
least
favorite
trappist
to
this
point
a
beer
that
tastes
better
as
it
warms
and
very
different
from
other
belgian
ales
however
very
expensive
so
im
not
sure
i
will
have
too
many
more
of
these
i
really
like
the
complexity
in
the
taste
of
this

a

beer
unless

for

you
will
most

enjoy
this
overall
im
going
to
assume
this
isnt
normal
the
beer
tasted
wrong
from
the
start
and
too
metallic
and
carbonated
pedestrian
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
really
have
the
belgian
characteristics
like
malt
that
im
used
to
i
think
ill
stick
to
darks
and
quads
maybe
its
the
low
abv
but
this
one
was
lacking
to
me
overall
interesting
trappist
ale
that
showcases
the
effects
of
brettanomyces
quite
well
dry
a
bit
funky
and
bready
nice
one
to
sip
on
both
a
cold
winter
night
or
a
warm
summer
evening
belgian
fans
must
o
a
nice
beer
although
i
like
chimay
or
westmalle
better
a
deep
golden
ale
that
leaves
a
big
bubbly
head
that
fades
after
a
minute
or
two
no
lacing
smell
is
earthy
and
funky
tastes
of

and
blue

its
dry
and
bitter
like
citrus
rind
with
a
bit
of
brett
funkiness
light
effervescent
mouthfeel
overall
very
nice
i
enjoy
belgian
ales
but
i
was
very
disappointed
with
orval
it
was
overly
carbonated
i
was
only
able
to
get
about
3
oz
of
beer
in
a
16
oz
tulip
glass
due
to
the
heavy
foam
once
i
was
able
to
try
the
orval
i
found
it
to
have
a
very
unusual
industrial
aroma
i
did
not
finish
the
beer
the
brewed
on
date
indicated
that
this
bottle
was
nearly
13
months
old
so
it
is
possible
it
had
turned
good
stuff
overall
unique
no
other
belgian
tastes
like
this
its
a
sipper
for
a
6
9abv
warming
brings
out
different
aromataste
qualities
o
unique
this
trappist
beer
is
unique
between
its
pars
and
between
every
other
beer
you
find
out
there
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
every
one
that
appreciates
a
good
beer
overall
great
beer
with
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
carbonation
sinto
dificuldade
em

esse
rótulo
por
se
tratar
de
algo
único
e
de
difícil

a
orval
é
a
cerveja
mais
original
do
universo
trapista
belga
ela
é
única
e
joga
com
suas
próprias
regras
o
que
posso
dizer
é
que
senti
falta
de
complexidade
e
seu
amargor
intenso
pode
ter
sido
mal
interpretado
por
mim
espero
revisitála
um

para

conclusões
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
made
unique
by
the
brettanomyces
a
dark

almost
like
a

apple
cider
very
voluminous

long

and

good

in

with
classic
belgian
influences
including
cloves

thank
you
brett
and
pineapple
flavor
is
again
a
nice
mix
of
brett
and
traditional
belgian
flavors
spicy
cloves
herbal
bitterness
not
too
much
imo
this
is
a
notch
above
most
belgian
ales
and
sets
itself
apart
hazy

with
a

contrasting
flavors
balanced
perfectly
perfectyep
thats
the
word
im
looking
for
perfect
ogreat
malty
flavor
that
starts
this
beer
off
right
it
has
good
balance
overall
as
michael
jackson
has
said
this
is
a
great
aperitif
it
is
light
and
very
easy
drinking
with
a
crisp
and
refreshing
character
interesting
to
see
how
this
has
developed
overall
a
tough
one
i
do
like
the
progressive
complexity
the
not
too
inyourface
brett
character
with
sour
notes
but
the
carbonation
is
silly
and
gets
in
the
way
still
a
massive
beer
definitely
a
must
try
some
oldschool
shit
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
duvel
belgian
pale
ale
sets
the
standard
for
the
price
i
will
probably
not
buy
this
beer
again
as
there
are
better
more
affordable
options
available
to
me
o
a
fine
belgian
with
restrained
fruity
yeast
flavor
extremely
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
however
unless
and
until
the
price
comes
way
down
from
6
to
23
i
probably
will
not
be
repurchasing
too
many
american
versions
which
are
nearly
as
good
if
not
a
little
better
overall
an
absolute
classic
and
truly
unique
experience
i
always
look
forward
to
this
beer
and
it
has
yet
to
disappoint
this
beer
to
me
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
would
love
to
try
this
when
it
is
super
fresh
someday
o
there
are
lots
of
subtleties
in
this
beer
nothing
is
over
the
top
but
there
is
so
much
depth
really
a
wonderful
beer
o
well
i
finally
got
to
try
the
trappist
beer
ive
been
waiting
so
long
for
i
feel
like
the
anticipation
of
trying
it
may
have
ruined
it
a
little
for
me
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
a
lot
i
picked
up
a
few
bottles
so
ill
be
getting
a
couple
more
tries
at
this
one
not
my
favourite
trappist
but
hey
its
better
than
a
lot
of
whats
available
in
my
area
so
i
wont
complain
a
trip
to
the
monastery
in
belgium
might
help
me
enjoy
this
one
a
little
more
great
beer
o
my
first
runin
with
orval
extremely
satisfied
highly
recommend
looking
forward
to
try
more
trappist
ales
orval
has
a
storied
history
but
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
has
a
lot
of
complexities
but
theyre
muddled
and
the
flavors
dont
pop
hard
to
recommend
over
say
matilda
mouth
more
thin
than
expected
almost
bordering
on
watery
lacking
significant
body
fairly
heavily
carbonated
too
much
carbonation
an
awkward
mouthfeel
and
a
taste
that
verges
into
an
area
of
something
bittersweet
this
beer
is
a
major
trappist
disappointment
overall
amazing
beer
that
has
been
an
inspiration
to
many
brewers
all
over
the
world
this
pint
is
incredible
but
it
seems
like
some
of
the
edges
could
be
rounded
out
a
bit
considering
the
generous
window
of
expiration
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
a
bottle
that
had
been
aged
for
a
couple
years
45
o
very
good
i
expected
a
lot
more
of
the
traditional
coriander
and
banana
it
is
a
very
good
glad
i
finally
tried
it
this
is
more
like
it
this
is
the
beer
i
remember
having
so
many
times
not
sure
if
i
just
got
a
random
off
bottle
that
i
ended
up
aging
but
the
brett
and
trappist
yeast
balance
here
is
something
of
beauty
perhaps
the
greatest
overall
beer
on
the
planet
always
available
and
outstanding
all
hail
the
trout
and
the
golden
ring
so
many
moral
problems
with
perfect
fives
nowadays
but
i
have
a
hard
time
justifying
not
doing
it
this
beer
is
as
close
as
it
gets
a
good
beer
glad
i
experienced
it
but
probably
wont
buy
it
again
especially
for
the
price
overall
very
glad
i
tried
it
if
was
available
at
lcbo
or
tbs
i
would
consider
picking
this
up
again
however
it
does
not
seem
to
be
frequently
available
and
at
the
price
tag
it
comes
with
i
would
rather
drink
other
beers
when
out
or
buy
beer
in
a
similar
vein
at
lcbo
and
get
34
times
as
much
however
i
recommend
a
try
as
i
seem
to
echo
some
of
the
reviews
in
that
this
beer
is
tough
to
nail
down
and
has
flavors
that
vary
from
bottle
to
bottle
cheers
beer
was
bottled
jan
2013
so
it
is
a
little
over
10
months
out
at
this
tasting
probably
my
2nd
favorite
trappist
beer
after
rochefort

awesome
stuff
o
delicate
brettanomyces
exists
in
this
beer
restrained
barnyard
funk
allows
the
dry
crackerlike
flavor
to
stay
a
large
part
of
the
beer
while
nuances
continue
to
come
out
as
its
enjoyed
the
crisp
drinkability
of
orval
suggests
it
would
make
for
a
fantastic
session
belgian
beer
if
it
werent
near
6
a
bottle
o
an
extremely
unique
complex
and
delicate
beer
as
only
the
belgians
can
create
someone
with
a
sophisticated
palate
could
find
some
quite
interesting
and
satisfying
food
pairings
with
this
brew
this
classic
trappist
ale
is
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
are
belgian
beer
enthusiast
or
just
love
beer
in
general
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
i
found
it
wonderfully
enchanting
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
know
you
are
going
to
love
just
from
the
way
it
pours
into
the
glass
i
asked
the
bartender
at
brazil
craft
beer
what
his
favorite
was
and
this
is
what
he
gave
me
at
first
i
thought
he
had
picked
it
to
boost
up
my
bar
tab
but
after
the
first
glance
knew
it
was
going
to
be
special
overall
a
beer
that
seems
to
vacillate
wildly
from
bottle
to
bottle
and
depending
on
age
ive
had
some
that
were
overpowering
hop
bitterness
and
funk
others
that
were
floral
and
slightly
fruity
and
still
others
that
hint
at
the
darker
fruits
of
your
classic
belgian
dark
ales
and
quads
its
an
enigma
to
be
sure
one
that
i
always
enjoy
but
i
lament
the
inability
to
find
it
very
fresh
in
the
u
s
especially
after
getting
to
have
some
that
was
about
3
months
after
bottling
when
i
visited
brussels
a
couple
years
ago
no
matter
as
the
weirdness
and
complexity
of
this
beer
is
what
always
draws
me
back
more
often
than
not
if
i
go
to
a
bottle
shop
looking
for
a
beer
without
luck
but
dont
want
to
leave
emptyhanded
ill
grab
a
bottle
of
orval
if
you
dont
like
it
the
first
time
you
try
it
i
still
would
encourage
you
to
give
it
another
try
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
lacked
the
punch
that
i
usually
enjoy
from
trappist
beers
from
notes

is
michael
jordan
the
best
basketball
player
its
probably
not
fair
to
say
since
there
may
be
some
undiscovered
guy
out
there
and
thats
how
i
feel
about
this
beerin
my
humble
opinion
it
seems
doubtful
that
there
will
ever
be
a
better
trappist
ale
and
yet
who
knows
what
i
do
know
though
is
that
i
enjoy
the
heck
out
of
thisits
amazing
appearance
a
huge
foamy
head
that
while
receding
quickly
leaves
great
lacing
and
a
smell
with
complex
floral
notes
and
candylike
sweetness
that
is
balanced
by
something
or
everything
and
keeps
the
smell
so
inviting
the
taste
is
amazingsweet
delicate
floral
balanced
intense
thoughtful
and
beautiful
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
making
it
a
beer
to
swirl
around
in
the
mouth
for
several
seconds
before
swallowing
allowing
the
opportunity
to
absorb
all
of
the
flavors
and
yet
even
the
mouthfeel
somehow
manages
to
seek
balance
with
its
crispness
overall
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
absolutely
one
of
the
best
out
there
even
considering
its
relatively
high
cost
about
4
25
per
11
2
ounce
bottle
some
may
fail
to
appreciate
the
beer
because
it
doesnt
have
the
high
abv
of
some
belgians
or
the
bitter
hop
taste
of
some
of
their
favorite
ipas
but
for
what
it
is
its
just
about
perfect
and
i
use
that
word
as
sparingly
as
i
can
if
i
were
to
die
someday
on
a
porch
or
watching
a
game
this
is
the
beer
i
would
want
in
my
hand
crafted
by
pure
soulsnature
ingredients
to
send
me
to
heaven
well
hopefully
to
heaven
hehe
o
great
beer
different
from
pretty
much
anything
ive
tried
reminds
me
of
a
beer
my
grandpa
used
to
drink
from
sraub
brewing
company
in
pa
the
beer
used
to
come
in
brown
boxes
and
poured
from
bottle
age
uncertain
but
probably
fairly
fresh
based
on
published
taste
descriptions
of
younger
samples
a
burnished
copper
color
with
a
vast
quantity
of
offwhite
lacey
head
aroma
is
a
potent
mix
of
pear
fermented
white
grape
citrus
notes
some
mild
peppery
spice
the
head
itself
is
acrid
and
bitter
tasting
of
burlap
sack
and
wood
char
maybe
let
this
settle
out
and
then
sip
the
liquid
the
latter
recalls
lemon
meringue
pie
pears
and
apples
figs
a
little
white
wine
aromatic
brown
spice
like
nutmeg
or
calamus
with
a
bonedry
finish
that
leaves
echoes
of
barnyard
funk
and
wine
cask
some
complain
of
excess
carbonation
but
i
did
not
notice
this
a
complex
and
polarizing
beer
that
stands
apart
from
other
trappist
beers
and
actually
captures
the
monks
intent
to
create
something
that
is
not
overtly
malty
or
sweet
some
pine
resin
results
from
dry
hopping
but
does
not
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
deserves
its
reputation
and
truly
unique
o
completely
unique
on
of
my
favorites
overall
much
better
than
i
remember
when
i
cant
get
any
saison
brett
ill
probably
turn
to
this
for
my
brett
fix
overall
this
beer
changed
quite
a
bit
as
it
warmed
up
the
off
taste
was
off
putting
but
great
smells
o
great
example
of
a
trappist
institution
pleased
to
have
found
a
bottle
with
some
age
on
it
1010
would
buy
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chalice
the
beer
is
a
muddled
hazy
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
tall
dense
chunky
offwhite
head
that
coats
the
glass
and
has
a
very
decent
retention
aromas
of
coriander
all
spice
plum
banana
cotton
candy
and
a
bready
backbone
more
and
more
aromas
come
off
as
the
beer
warms
flavors
are
spice
forward
with
a
great
blend
of
nutmeg
coriander
all
spice
and
hints
of
clove
with
an
old
world
fruit
backbone
both
rich
and
sweet
smooth
light
body
with
a
slight
effervescence
that
keeps
the
sweet
and
rich
flavors
blended
and
drinkable
the
aftertaste
is
a
sugary
sweet
undertone
with
the
spice
blend
still
holding
court
overall
lingering
finish
with
spices
left
dancing
on
your
taste
buds
waiting
for
another
sip
this
beer
is
a
classic
just
amazing
my
perfect
daily
beer
great
with
cheese
or
just
as
a
refreshing
beverage
it
is
probably
where
new
belgium
got
their
inspiration
for
fat
tire
i
love
and
drink
all
the
belgium
trapist
brews
but
this
i
could
drink
to
my
satisfaction
and
still
walk
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
disappointed
because
i
feel
this
brew
is
over
rated

glass
initially
sharp
smooth
and
drawnout

i
would
recommend
this
beer
with
slightly
lower
expectations
o
im
guessing
this
is
a
good
introductory
trappist
beer
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
it
was
a
greatly
balenced
bled
of
hops
and
malt
and
the
wild
yeast
works
very
well
with
the
medium

great
brew
for
sure

the

is
as
badass
as
they
come
i
love
this
beer
for
true
sincere
not
as
a
great
as
some
would
say
maybe
its
an
old
bottle
but
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
bright
and
flavorful
but
it
is
rather
dry
and
bitter
the
bitterness
does
not
add
anything
to
the
beer
overall
a
wonderful
trappist
ale
to
revisit
again
and
again

this

like
a
fairly
strong

to
me
nice
and
malty
with
the
best
appearance
ive
ever
seen
to
date
there
is
just
some
character
missing
that
i
expected
from
a
malty
trappist
good

pricey

overall
a
classic
and
one
of
the
giants
todays
brewers
stand
on
the
back
of
one
day
ill
save
my
lunch
money
and
get
started
with
a
handful
of
bottles
for
some
long
term
cellaring
and
verticals
o
i
dont
know
if
its
the
lack
of
freshness
but
this
isnt
my
kind
of
style
anyway
perhaps
sitting
at
a
tap
in
brussells
and
not
being
at
work
would
rocket
this
baby
up
the
happymeter
but
i
will
concede
i
just
parted
with
3
in
the
govt
coffers
that
didnt
do
me
a
lot
in
return
stella

very
carbonated
super
rich
most
unique
trappist
ive
had
so
far
while
rochefort
12
or
st
barnardus
12
are
on
my
must
try
list
for
people
just
getting
started
orval
is
the
one
who
can
bring
the
ah
ha
back
to
the
most
jaded
advocate
o
not
a
bad
bpa
very
interesting
fruitiness
with
good
sweetness
and
drying
contrasts
odd
metallic
flavor
kinda
detracts
a
bit
not
sure
what
thats
all
about
possibly
due
to
the
age
still
flavors
meld
together
well
and
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
brew
i
enjoyed
it
o
this
is
an
iconic
beer
made
by
perfectionists
you
will
never
grow
tired
of
this
beer
and
it
has
a
flavour
all
of
its
own
one
of
those
beers
that
is
both
sessionable
and
serves
as
a
great
nightcap
i
really
like
this
one
the
taste
was
damn
near
perfect
wonderfully
balanced
with
a
clean
and
light
finish
that
lacked
any
boozy
bite
an
absolutely
outstanding
trappist
that
has
cracked
my
top
5
i
will
most
certainly
be
purchasing
this
one
again
o
very
good
i
wasnt
sure
of
what
to
expect
with
this
well
known
beer
also
i
not
very
experienced
in
this
class
of
belgian
pale
ales
either
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
all
around
though
and
i
will
be
having
more
of
these
in
the
future
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
white
head
that
settles
into
a
lacy
cap
complex
aroma
of
yeast
caramel
and
funk
earthy
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
and
some
barnyard
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
starts
and
finishes
bone
dry
super
complex
and
superbly
crafted
though
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
one
of
the
worlds
great
beers
look
i
know
this
one
has
a
huge
amount
of
lovers
maybe
this
bottle
is
between
ideal
age
about
10
months
old
maybe
another
year
makes
it
more
sour
or
a
bit
fresher
it
is
a
bit
more
something
i
dont
know
either
way
theres
nothing
really
wrong
i
have
no
idea
what
style
youd
call
this
it
isnt
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
ive
come
to
know
them
so
im
not
sure
how
to
really
judge
it
a
sour
but
not
sour
pale
ale
sorry
ill
pass
overall
not
as
complex
as
many
belgians
in
a
way
it
is
refreshing
in
how
straightforward
it
is
fun
to
drink
but
the
heavy
carbonation
makes
it
sippable
not
gluggable
never
overwhelming
every
sip
is
pleasant
the
head
is
the
most
impressive
i
have
seen
not
a
nerdy
beer
more
of
a
back
porch
easygoing
beer
when
youre
trying
to
kick
back
and
sip
on
one
or
two
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
expensive
but
worth
it
if
you
value
your
life
and
the
moments
that
remain
osolid
bpa
with
a
great
aroma
would
be
great
pared
with
some
cheese
overall
impression
though
not
as
complex
as
other
trappist
ales
this
one
does
achieve
impressive
drinkability
for
the
the
dubbel
style
o
basically
its
an
awesome
beer
its
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
to
introduce
your
friends
to
the
wonderful
world
of
beer
anyone
can
taste
the
greatness
in
orval
pours
hazy
orange
with
a
billowing
head
of
resilient
foam
that
finally
dwindled
to
a
rocky
cap
with
dense
sticky
lacing
a
spectacular
pour
into
a
tulip
nose
is
complex
and
kept
expanding
as
it
warmed
sweet
belgian
yeast
apples
floral
banana
some
medicinal
alcohol
a
little
caramel
malt
poking
through
all
that
bright
fruit
and
brett
funk
and
ultimately
finds
some
spice
character
taste
is
superb
relaxed
smooth
full
without
heaviness
some
lemon
some
hay
and
horse
blanket
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
at
all
drinks
very
dry
and
leaves
a
long
bitter
finish
that
isnt
tart
or
sour
its
earthy
and
hop
bitter
very
impressive
indulgent
full
of
traditional
character
and
easily
approachable
for
a
session
overall
4
55
orval
is
legendary
for
a
reason
its
a
totally
awesome
beer
and
a
great
intro
to
brettinfused
beer
while
its
not
a
particularly
intense
beer
its
very
refreshing
and
certainly
a
unique
take
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
one
of
the
rare
trappist
ales
that
isnt
thick
and
heavy
it
also
features
more
obvious
hop
character
than
those
beers
great
stuff
thats
certainly
worth
buying
if
you
see
it
hanging
out
on
the
shelf
and
fear
notorval
has
quite
a
good
shelf
life
dust
off
that
bottle
from
2010
and
enjoy
some
vintage
beer
fantastic
overall
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
my
only
letdown
was
that
the
flavor
wasnt
as
good
as
the
smell
led
on
but
still
fantastic
overall
overall
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
since
this
is
my
first
belgian
pale
ale
it
is
definitely
sweeter
than
an
american
pale
ale
but
the
hops
that
come
in
on
the
backend
are
strong
but
not
overpowering
i
like
it
i
am
going
to
try
more
of
this
style
fantastic
beer
has
everything
that
a
beer
needs
every
good
beer
characteristic
refreshing
warm
hoppy
malty
creamy
earthy
etc
etc
balanced
in
a
single
bottle
would
actively
seek
it
out
in
the
future
to
try
again
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
nice
belgian
characters
blended
with
nice
brett
like
funk
this
is
not
even
a
year
old
so
the
wild
character
is
barely
there
but
ive
had
some
quite
aged
ones
and
they
are
a
lot
funkier
and
awesome
maybe
i
should
rereview
an
old
bottle
sometime
but
still
a
great
belgian
beer
o
i
quite
enjoyed
this
im
sure
i
would
have
quite
enjoyed
meeting
simon
may
he
rest
in
peace
o
solid
drinking
brew
bottled
in
july
2012
o
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
a
trappist
classic
and
a
well
deserving
of
this
title
smells
like
dark
fruits
tastes
like
rasberries
blueberries
and
dark
flavors
sweet
with
a
carbonation
ending
refreshing
this
beer
pairs
very
well
with
fish
tacos
seared
ahi
ahi
poke
ceviche
and
carne
asada
i
highly
recommend
this
unique
trappist
to
anyone
overall
despite
the
messy
beginning
this
is
really
good
and
enjoyable
easy
and
refreshing
to
drink
too
id
love
to
try
an
older
bottle
of
this
at
some
point
as
i
think
a
bottle
with
some
age
would
do
really
well
complex
and
interesting
to
drink
cheers
overall
one
of
the
classics
in
the
beer
world
its
not
mind
blowing
and
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
an
extremely
well
crafted
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
every
day
o
havent
had
this
one
in
a
long
time
and
it
didnt
disappoint
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
with
a
nice
dark
copper
amber
color
with
lots
of
head
very
bready
nose
to
this
taste
was
a
little
sugary
with
hints
of
lemon
and
cloves
finish
was
dry
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
would
definitely
be
something
that
i
would
pick
up
again
overall
i
had
this
beer
67
years
ago
but
did
not
review
it
picked
up
a
bottle
for
review
and
to
see
how
my
palate
has
changed
over
the
years
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
seems
to
be
a
style
all
its
own
i
dont
taste
too
much
sour
or
funkiness
but
still
a
unique
experience
o
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
imagine
this
is
the
top
of
the
top
but
it
didnt
impress
me
like
other
trapists
ive
had
i
chalk
this
up
to
the
style
of
beer
orval
is
did
not
find
anything
out
of
ordinary
overall
a
very
strange
beer
certainly
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
not
terrible
either
o
this
is
a
great
trappist
beer
with
great
green
fruit
flavours
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
i
remember
this
being
much
better
i
guess
the
brett
can
be
patchy
anyway
and
this
may
just
be
a
more
subtle
one
than
the
usual
as
it
is
its
a
decent
but
not
exciting
belgian
ale
for
me
and
one
i
may
well
revisit
and
rereview
o
hard
to
judge
good
to
drink
more
tart
than
most
as
well
as
more
bitter
wish
the
tartness
werent
so
overpowering
and
allowed
more
ester
variety
to
shine
served
at
suggested
temperature
head
is
out
of
control
becomes
stale
after
a
while
i
just
do
not
like
this
beer
this
beer
is
not
here
to
blow
your
socks
off
but
instead
be
extremely
well
crafted
of
the
belgian
pales
ive
had
i
like
this
along
with
la
chouffe
the
most
the
funkiness
is
really
something
different
and
highly
recommend
you
try
this
if
trying
to
get
into
brett
beers
this
is
known
to
be
a
world
class
beer
and
it
never
disappoints
even
with
persistent
bottle
variations
btw
this
is
vinnie
cilurzo
rrbc
favorite
beer
overall
this
beer
belongs
on
the
beers
of
fame
and
it
will
make
it
there
as
soon
as
it
reaches
the
cusp
of
that
2000th
review
it
is
an
outstanding
beer
one
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
over
and
over
again
very
happy
i
bought
it
condor
recommended
and
approved
bottle
from
total
beverage
in
murfreesboro
tn
vastly
different
from
other
trappist
beers
ive
had
unique
bottle
shape
poured
into
a
tulip
highly
carbonated
huge
head
lots
of
lacing
pours
very
light
yelloworange
cloudy
like
a
hefe
as
its
unfiltered
pretty
decent
looking
beer
cant
lie
smells
decently
hoppy
with
other
similaraities
to
a
hefe
with
notes
of
citrus
subtle
banana
and
clove
with
a
splash
of
coriander
drinks
very
smooth
with
a
subtle
hoppy
bite
very
distinictive
belgian
yeast
taste
but
with
more
bitterness
than
than
sweetness
yet
not
overpowering
lots
of
carbonation
has
a
sort
of
wine
like
aftertaste
but
lacks
the
punch
i
was
expecting
for
a
7
beer
i
guess
this
could
be
good
or
bad
very
well
balanced
beer
will
buy
more
although
i
prefer
other
trappist
beers
this
one
stylistically
is
very
different
stylistically
from
the
likes
of
rochefort
westmalle
etc
o
there
seems
to
be
a
group
of
people
who
loves
this
beer
and
those
who
hate
it
personally
im
the
latter
i
just
dont
like
it
not
that
other
people
shouldnt
its
just
not
what
floats
my
boat
i
wish
i
could
like
this
and
it
really
seemed
like
something
that
i
would
im
typically
a
pretty
big
fan
of
anything
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
in
it
but
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
feel
like
im
going
to
have
to
give
this
another
go
in
the
future
o
definitely
one
of
the
finest
beers
to
ever
cross
my
lips
hands
down
the
best
example
of
a
bpa
ive
ever
had
this
was
my
first
encounter
with
orval
so
ive
never
had
a
young
version
to
compare
with
this
one
i
will
absolutely
be
adding
a
few
bottles
to
my
growing
collection
and
sampling
them
at
various
ages
overall
easy
to
review
and
grade
a
no
doubts
about
it
i
have
founded
a
new
go
to
beer
this
easily
one
of
the
top
ten
belgian
beers
that
i
have
had
this
is
much
more
exciting
than
a
quad
it
has
the
simplicity
and
perfection
of
some
tripels
with
the
added
positive
of
saison
messiness
this
is
a
delight
to
drink
oit
was
good
beer
ill
have
to
try
it
again
sometime
but
did
not
blow
me
away
o
i
really
wish
i
had
a
younger
version
to
compare
this
bottle
to
right
now
i
dont
think
this
particular
bottle
is
representative
of
what
this
beer
is
like
fresh
i
am
enjoying
it
but
its
not
at
all
what
i
remember
it
to
be
or
how
others
have
described
it
here
on
ba
i
will
revisit
this
one
with
a
fresher
specimen
when
i
find
one
oa
must
try
beer
definitely
a
bench
mark
example
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
o
simple
yet
complicated
at
the
same
time
refreshing
and
crisp
while
wanting
to
be
tart
and
complex
without
being
sour
a
must
have
in
my
book
and
one
damn
unique
trappist
brew
that
can
be
easily
found
and
decently
priced
highly
recommended
to
anyone
i
will
give
this
another
try
as
this
was
purchased
in
japan
so
may
well
be
a
bad
example
but
unfortunately
i
think
it
may
be
how
this
beer
is
intended
would
i
have
it
again
hell
yes
this
was
a
treat
o
not
impressed
but
a
decent
beer
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
o
the
prototype
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
so
easy
to
drink
yet
usually
enjoyed
sip
by
sip
to
enjoy
the
abundance
of
flavors
coming
from
this
classic
i
will
probably
retry
this
in
the
future
because
i
question
if
this
bottle
or
batch
was
representative
of
the
product
a
quintessential
trappist
ale
that
fully
lives
up
to
its
reputation
bottle
from
the
lcbo
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
colour
with
amber
highlights
it
has
an
impressive
largebubbled
and
offwhite
head
that
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
belgian
yeastforward
with
the
spices
that
implies
and
a
nice
caramelized
malt
backbone
flavours
range
from
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
to
hopped
bitterness
and
coriander
lemon
rind
as
that
portfolio
changes
and
gains
depth
as
the
beer
warms
it
is
definitely
a
bottle
to
sip
and
savour
yeast
you
know
its
there
and
it
really
adds
to
the
texture
of
the
beer
when
you
swirl
that
sediment
into
your
glass
o
great
trappist
beer
simple
straight
forward
label
design
which
has
an
interesting
story
behind
it
overall
this
is
my
first
trappist
ale
and
its
not
bad
its
a
little
different
than
what
i
normally
enjoy
but
i
like
it
overall
this
beer
deserves
hight
honors
and
it
is
one
the
highest
rated
beers
in
my
profile
this
beer
has
been
sitting
in
my
cupboard
for
a
year
which
really
made
it
taste
so
good
it
is
a
higher
6
9
but
it
felt
like
a
lower
45
i
was
quite
pleased
with
the
nonalcohol
taste
i
have
a
couple
more
in
my
cupboard
that
i
will
open
next
year
perhaps
the
year
after
the
date
says
they
are
good
until
2017
maybe
ill
just
wait
until
then
to
crack
these
babies
open
eh
the
older
the
better
cheers
this
beer
is
very
different
from
what
i
expected
all
these
trappist
ales
have
been
very
on
the
sweet
side
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
is
very
dry
subtle
hop
and
pine
notes
light
apricot
flavors
and
a
very
dry
finish
the
head
on
this
beer
is
a
soft
egg
white
pillow
like
texture
which
is
very
similar
to
how
it
feels
in
the
mouth
smells
much
sweeter
than
it
tastes
though
you
would
expect
a
sweet
dark
fruit
flavor
but
one
would
be
met
by
the
opposite
o
very
good
beer
but
not
as
amazing
as
i
was
hoping
still
i
respect
it
and
then
some
taste
very
very
relaxed
sweetness
permeates
the
entire
brew
and
absolutely
none
of
the
alcohol
from
the
nose
is
apparent
those
floral
hops
play
a
much
larger
role
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
would
indicate
and
its
entirely
refreshing
when
enjoyed
under
the
slick
wet
mouthfeel
that
the
brew
supplies
somewhat
distinctive
if
not
generic
yeast
notes
are
omnipresent
throughout
the
sip
but
im
not
picking
up
the
fruit
notes
that
the
aroma
indicated
nearly
as
much
as
i
anticipated
carbonation
is
medium
and
crisp
pepper
rings
out
strong
throughout
i
saw
a
review
that
mentioned
a
freshcut
hay
quality
and
its
right
on
the
money
the
finish
is
a
really
sweet
organic
banana
note
that
makes
itself
known
even
after
youve
finished
taking
a
sip
overall
this
is
perhaps
the
most
refreshing
of
the
trappist
ales
but
certainly
doesnt
compromise
in
complexity
overall
drinkability
its
very
rare
that
i
find
a
beer
disappointing
but
still
think
its
one
of
the
better
beers
out
there
this
is
worth
a
go
in
style
4
25
overall
after
all
the
massive
hype
surrounding
this
beer
i
actually
thought
it
fell
short
a
bit
it
is
certainly
fairly
unique
and
quite
decent
but
i
still
reckon
i
could
get
a
better
beer
and
far
better
bang
for
my
buck
by
going
to
something
like
a
st
feuillien
tripel
i
could
see
this
with
seafood
octopus
mussels
or
squid
would
be
my
choices
oit
seems
that
all
of
the
flavours
in
this
beer
come
to
play
in
equal
quantity
nothing
takes
the
lead
and
everything
comes
together
at
the
right
moment
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
well
made
beer
one
of
the
best
out
there
and
possibly
my
favorite
of
all
the
trappist
brews
pours
a
sort
of
copper
red
color
brassy
and
thin
looking
with
a
tall
white
head
comprised
of
fairly
large
bubbles
the
nose
is
a
little
bretty
kind
of
funky
and
wild
with
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
really
robust
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
quite
similar
to
the
nose
rich
in
taste
but
not
in
feel
yeasty
with
some
brown
sugar
notes
and
quite
spiced
more
than
the
other
trappists
anyways
i
had
an
infected
bottle
of
this
recently
as
well
and
the
brett
notes
of
that
were
downright
overwhelming
like
a
wild
ale
i
almost
actually
preferred
this
funked
out
version
to
the
normal
offering
and
am
wondering
how
i
might
obtain
another
even
the
standard
product
has
quite
a
bit
of
interesting
yeasty
stuff
happening
carbonation
is
vigorous
and
the
body
is
pretty
light
this
beer
has
its
reputation
for
a
reason
and
is
the
product
of
top
craftsmanship
one
of
my
favorite
beers
with
a
nice
dinner
too
very
versatile
and
palate
cleansing
with
its
mild
acidity
yum
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
is
beautifully
complex
yet
easily
approachable
and
very
drinkable
the
combination
of
aromas
and
flavors
is
so
unique
and
wellcrafted
that
i
had
a
tough
time
deciphering
the
individual
elements
of
each
these
trappist
monks
know
what
theyre
doing
their
beers
are
phenomenal
this
beer
is
fantastic
overall
different
than
id
though
it
would
be
nice
though
o
a
nice
and
complex
trappist
pale
with
a
good
showing
of
what
brett
can
do
for
a
beer
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
belgians
and
trappist
beers
pours
orange
with
just
a
bit
of
quickly
receding
head
smell
of
yeast
funk
pepper
banana
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
effervescent
the
flavor
follows
with
a
very
dry
yeasty
spice
some
sweet
sugars
and
hay
simple
and
yet
well
done
yay
belgium
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
think
it
is
vastly
overrated
among
my
fellow
beer
advocates
perhaps
the
simplicity
is
its
charm
o
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
i
like
its
bitter
and
funk
but
its
almost
way
too
over
the
top
i
really
with
this
beer
were
a
more
balanced
overall
excellent
excellent
beer
this
will
just
be
one
more
review
of
praise
for
orval
but
it
deserves
it
this
could
easily
become
my
favorite
warm
weather
beers
much
different
that
other
belgian
pales
like
dekonick
less
malt
driven
pours
into
the
glass
a
lightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
frothy
meringue
head
that
persists
forever
the
label
is
correct
about
the
fruitiness
i
get
that
in
spades
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cap
off
the
top
of
the
bottle
pepper
spice
yeast
and
a
bit
of
golden
syrup
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
sugary
sweet
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
sweet
dark
fruits
along
with
some
pepper
a
hint
of
hop
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
sweet
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
i
cant
believe
it
took
so
many
years
to
try
this
i
am
opening
a
bottle
dated
november
2011
almost
foams
over
when
opened
but
it
sticks
to
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
without
spilling
pours
nice
violinresin
color
with
foamy
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
at
the
top
big
sour
and
fruitty
smell
a
bit
of
herb
but
mostly
light
sour
raspberry
candy
on
the
nose
taste
starts
totally
different
with
the
malts
bubbling
on
my
tongue
with
the
yeast
and
fruit
coming
at
the
roof
and
candie
with
sour
dry
aftertaste
the
sour
notes
stick
lightly
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
sides
of
the
tongue
after
but
its
relaxing
thats
a
damn
good
one
o
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
pale
ale
that
is
very
well
balanced

long

white
head
and
nice

is
of

belgian

this

poured

a

11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
fruity
yeast
alive
with
flavor
taste
is
also
big
on
fruits
some
malts
and
yeast
lots
of
flavor
here
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
and
the
earthy
character
makes
this
both
different
from
others
in
the
same
style
as
well
as
providing
it
with
a
little
more
character
as
a
person
who
edges
towards
the
funkysour
end
this
is
my
type
of
beer
but
likely
not
offensive
to
others
who
do
not
prefer
funk
all
that
much
o
really
unique
and
diverse
and
at
the
end
of
the
night
i
liked
it
definitely
a
sipper
and
something
to
enjoy
as
it
warms
and
different
flavors
emerge
this
bottle
is
around
10
months
old
and
im
sure
older
bottles
taste
vastly
different
because
of
the
brett
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
very
unique
and
very
tasty
brew
really
enjoyed
this
o
a
real
quality
beer
no
doubt
about
that
but
i
found
it
too
dry
and
bitter
wouldnt
be
a
problem
if
it
were
balanced
accordingly
but
from
my
experience
bitter
hops
in
belgians
tend
to
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
however
and
ill
have
it
again
after
having
had
it
a
couple
times
relatively
fresh
in
the
states
i
drank
an
aged
orval
while
in
belgium
it
was
possibly
the
best
beer
i
ever
drank
the
brett
takes
over
and
leaves
the
fruit
and
hop
flavors
in
the
background
it
is
funky
perfection
i
love
most
other
belgian
styles
but
this
was
my
first
bpa
it
may
take
awhile
before
i
pick
up
another
but
im
sure
ill
give
it
one
more
try
someday
o
this
brew
stands
out
from
the
other
trappist
beers
in
a
number
of
ways
like
i
said
its
complex
and
unique
and
certainly
drinkable
but
theres
room
for
improvement
ill
be
drinking
this
again
o
a
very
nice
brew
if
i
had
to
chose
one
beer
to
drink
through
out
the
summer
this
would
be
it
overall
finally
went
for
this
classic
and
it
did
not
disappoint
would
love
to
see
what
a
bottle
is
like
near
the
enjoy
by
date
i
love
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
are
really
good
and
it
has
a
nice
carbonation
that
i
like
its
nowhere
near
any
other
trappist
beer
though
its
closer
to
an
ipa
even
which
is
why
i
dont
score
the
overall
a
5
but
wow
this
is
a
really
really
good
beer
i
like
this
but
i
remember
it
tasting
a
little
different
almost
bubblegummy
in
the
past
editions
but
i
am
grading
it
from
a
perspective
of
knowing
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
rate
this
with
the
duvel
and
chimay
up
at
the
very
top
these
brews
can
be
very
rich
but
when
in
the
mood
excellent
the
only
dings
in
this
would
be
the
small
bubbly
champagne
sensation
on
the
lips
and
the
unexpected
vinegary
smell
i
got
from
the
start
although
i
do
love
those
sours
also
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
fresh
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
citrus
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
between
the
hop
bitterness
and
the
fruity
sweetness
the
beer
is
also
yeasty
this
is
by
far
my
all
time
favorite
a
true
classic
that
can
be
drunk
on
every
occasion
o
very
good
not
the
great
ale
i
was
expecting
from
reputation
will
try
again
though
a
recommended
beer
orval
is
a
pretty
awesome
trappist
ale
i
guess
when
you
only
brew
one
beer
you
have
more
time
to
test
tweak
and
perfect
it
and
it
seems
like
the
monks
at
brasserie
dorval
have
done
just
that
on
most
days
id
say
that
this
is
not
my
favorite
trappist
ale
although
it
always
stands
out
to
me
as
the
most
unique
the
brett
and
the
dryhopping
really
set
it
apart
from
the
others
and
always
keep
me
coming
back
to
this
funny
oblong
bottle
appearance
is
clear
light
copper
with
big
rocky
head
smell
is
complex
with
notes
of
honey
light
fruit
floral
and
herbal
notes
a
bit
of
citrus
and
slight
earthy
and
phenolic
yeasty
smells
taste
is
bitter
at
first
and
then
herbal
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
bit
of
wild
yeast
funk
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
although
some
american
wild
ales
are
the
closest
dry
with
a
some
bite
in
the
finish
and
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
very
well
carbonated
with
a
great
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
not
one
to
gulp
down
but
take
a
sip
and
then
you
will
quickly
take
another
and
another
overall
this
is
one
of
the
big
classic
belgians
you
pretty
much
have
to
try
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
unique
and
very
good
msharp
spicy
bites
you
for
tongue
somewhere
back
oeverything
was
perfect
and
then
i
was
let
down
when
the
beer
was
actually
in
my
mouth
not
bad
but
i
was
disappointed
nice
honey
color
liked
the
foam
a
lot
it
covers
the
full
surface
forever
and
i
value
that
smells
like
typical
belgian
ale
yeast
very
very
yeasty
tastes
a
bit
sour
and
yeasty
again
medium
body
i
think
its
a
food
beer
meaning
its
better
with
food
then
just
by
itself
i
am
having
it
now
with
garlic
mashed
potatoes
rutabagas
and
roasted
chicken
and
roasted
garlic
on
top
of
watercress
quite
pleasant
im
going
to
leave
this
somewhat
open
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
its
growing
on
me
ill
return
to
this
and
give
an
update
this
shant
be
my
last
orval
o
a
must
try
for
any
beer
geek
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
world
this
may
be
a
desert
island
beer
for
me
ive
yet
to
have
a
bottle
more
than
about
a
year
old
so
havent
appreciated
any
of
the
higher
level
of
funk
that
aging
brett
will
bring
out
world

go
along
with
it

appeal
overall
i
feel
like
i
might
have
built
this
one
up
a
little
too
much
great
for
the
style
i
would
love
to
drink
these
in
a
session
but
im
afraid
i
just
cant
afford
that
back
to
my
copperhead

decent
enough

the

not
my
thing
and
this
reminds
me
of
why
this
beer
was
amazing
im
sitting
here
looking
at
my
last
sips
wondering
when
ill
pick
up
another
i
think
because
of
the
age
of
this
beer
it
may
be
more
sour
making
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
id
certainly
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
but
for
now
i
am
ok
with
small
humble
and
sometimes
dusty
but
not
expensive
o
perhaps
the
best
belgian
pale
on
the
market
a
beautiful
and
crazy
beer
i
can
see
why
so
many
rave
about
it
really
nothing
else
like
it
super
complex
and
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
but
really
satisfying
to
sip
and
admire
this
is
gonna
be
an
obsession
overall
good
welcomed
differentiation
from
other
trappist
beers
unique
but
very
balanced
and
clean
tasting
overall
a
fantastic
beer
its
complexity
makes
for
a
great
sipping
beer
those
monks
are
doing
a
great
job
at
their
brewery
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
but
it
is
very
tasty
o
i
typically
like
trappist
ales
especially
pale
ales
but
this
one
didnt
make
me
want
to
order
another
still
better
than
the
average
beer
oi
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
i
was
not
blown
away
i
found
it
rather
simple
perhaps
i
have
ruined
my
palate
by
drinking
too
many
crazy
ipas
recently
but
this
one
was
underwhelming
it
drinks
easily
but
i
expected
more
intrigue
for
the
5
per
11
2
oz
i
paid
for
my
two
bottles
recently
just
for
the
record
bottled
on
10211
good
through
10216
price
point
5
6911
2oz
bottle
o
theres
nothing
quite
like
this
beer
matilda
and
rayon
vert
may
be
homages
to
this
beer
but
they
just
cant
compete
with
the
insane
complexity
and
high
drinkability
of
this
age
has
also
turned
this
into
a
brett
bomb
world
class
for
sure
overall
odd
very
odd
heavy
belgian
influence
but
so
earthy
its
confusing
im
a
little
sad
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
this
beer
its
good
with
an
extremely
unique
profile
o
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
journey
from
start
to
finish
its
interesting
and
its
quality
shines
through
thats
what
i
want
on
my
beer
safari
im
not
sure
ive
quite
figured
it
out
yet
and
will
definitely
want
to
get
it
again
thumbs
up
o
excellent
belgian
brew
great
complex
flavors
and
aromas
o
from
one
of
the
8
trappist
breweries
in
the
world
the
only
beer
they
brew
when
you
try
it
you
will
appreciate
the
craftsmanship
that
goes
into
making
this
one
of
the
very
best
pale
belgian
ales
i
drank
orval
roughly
4
years
ago
and
it
stuck
in
my
mind
as
being
particularly
interesting
now
i
am
reaching
the
realization
that
this
is
even
more
complex
than
i
once
thought
this
does
not
really
taste
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
yes
it
has
pale
ale
malts
but
its
also
very
flowery
had
some
sourfunk
notes
and
kind
of
tastes
like
a
white
wine
bonus
points
for
uniqueness
drawn
to
this
bottle
for
some
reason
bready
boozy
smell
at
outset
ciderlike
color
with
thick
lacing
the
best
part
of
this
brew
for
me
is
the
complexity
at
first
taste
i
do
sense
the
yeast
the
astringency
is
there
as
others
will
agree
here
i
may
seem
off
a
bit
in
this
but
vinegar
comes
to
mind
as
a
mouth
sensation
if
you
can
somehow
picture
that
in
a
good
way
i
guess
there
is
an
odd
abrasiveness
that
somehow
works
yes
it
is
quite
dry
however
i
cant
help
and
can
hardly
believe
that
i
also
detect
fruit
or
fig
in
the
taste
as
i
mentioned
this
is
all
about
complexity
the
mouthfeel
for
me
is
most
abrasive
up
front
but
it
is
up
front
where
i
also
smell
the
fruitlike
bouquet
as
i
am
tasting
it
for
some
reason
and
i
cant
pinpoint
exactly
how
but
this
is
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
with
such
a
distinct
character
spices
are
picked
up
too
unusual
i
guess
the
reason
i
think
orval
is
so
good
despite
some
unusual
characteristics
is
due
to
the
expertise
in
the
brewery
of
using
their
brettanomyces
yeasts
the
way
they
do
apparently
in
most
beers
these
yeasts
are
considered
contaminants
with
that
its
no
wonder
i
also
favor
saisons
all
good
here
o
great
beer
but
this
stuff
really
needs
to
be
paired
with
some
good
cheese
to
allow
its
character
to
truly
come
through
this
really
isnt
for
everyone
so
keep
that
in
mind
it
gets
high
marks
more
for
its
craftsmanship
than
anything
totally
disappointing
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
if
this
particular
bottle
was
stored
improperly
for
some
time
causing
it
to
go
sour
ill
probably
rechallenge
this
some
other
time
to
make
sure
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
delightful
as
it
coats
the
palate
smooth
balanced
refreshing
everything
this
ale
should
be
spritzes
the
tongue
with
fresh
fruits
and
a
drop
of
ethanol
mediumbodied
one
really
feels
classy
drinking
this
ale
cheers
o
a
really
nice
beer
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
really
quite
impeccable
beer
it
deserves
to
be
hyped
and
avoids
going
overboard
on
any
respects
maintaining
a
quite
complexity
and
great
drinkability
this
was
had
quite
young
and
i
would
love
to
try
aging
a
couple
bottles
for
a
year
or
two
the
brett
came
out
most
on
the
nose
where
the
taste
was
full
of
intricacies
a
great
beer
originally
reviewed

orval
trappist
ale
pours
a
bit
of
a
dark
golden
color
with
not
much
of
a
lacy
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
and
has
come
candy
aromas
on
a
strawery
backbone
the
taste
is
much
the
same
sweet
candy
flavors
on
a
strawery
backbone
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
but
had
a
nice
flavor
overall
i
found
it
an
above
average
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
and
overrated
in
my
opinion
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
amber
with
a
two
finger
clean
white
head
abundant
lacing
visible
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
and
flora
with
a
hint
of
pine
seems
to
be
a
mediumbodied
brew
at
first
but
finishes
light
very
dry
crisp
and
clean
tart
citrus
rind
and
grass
dominate
with
dry
fruit
tones
throughout
fantastic
dry
belgian
pale
ale
definitely
one
of
the
very
best
available
overall
solid
stuff
but
this
bottle
isnt
reminiscent
of
ones
consumed
overseas
overall
i
must
first
note
that
i
let
this
age
for
about
4
5
months
before
i
couldnt
help
it
any
longer
and
enjoyed
it
as
a
graduation
gift
to
myself
a
most
excellent
belgian
trappist
ale
very
interesting
and
complex
i
highly
recommend
this
gem
of
an
ale
to
be
enjoyed
during
a
light
dinner
or
as
a
standalone
i
had
this
by
itself
and
it
was
most
satisfying
will
buy
again
when
i
can
afford
6
for
an
11
2
vaselike
bottle
o
has
a
quite
unique
peculiar
bittering
profile
that
does
not
make
it
an
easy
drinker
though
i
would
still
consider
this
one
as
a
quite
refreshing
ale
overall
a
superyeasty
unique
beer
that
is
packed
with
flavour
though
its
been
a
lot
of
tries
since
i
last
found
that
amazing
complexity
and
balance
that
im
still
expecting
everytime
im
trying
one
of
these
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
thats
for
sure
this
is
delightful
o
very
unusual
very
nice
not
one
for
the
regular
circulation
but
definitely
a
must
try
wow
what
a
delight
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
for
sure
got
another
couple
in
the
cupboard
ill
let
them
age
a
bit
see
how
they
mature
o
i
remember
this
being
better
on
previous
occasions
the
aroma
was
a
very
nice
mixture
of
citrus
and
funkiness
but
the
flavor
didnt
quite
pack
the
intensity
i
was
expecting
from
the
aroma
decent
nonetheless
one
of
the
most
original
and
funkiest
beers
ever
made
drinking
it
makes
me
feel
like
i
am
walking
through
a
hay
field
during
the
early
harvest
lots
of
cows
grazing
around
in
the
fields
freshly
pollinated
flowers
and
funky
fresh
smells
all
on
the
wind
love
the
beer
have
had
it
fresh
less
than
three
months
old
and
aged
3
years
in
bottle
and
i
love
it
every
time
every
bottle
is
different
but
the
funk
and
the
pure
farm
freshness
remains
each
time
overall
its
a
very
distinctive
beer
and
one
i
would
recommend
even
to
those
who
shy
from
trappist
ales
poured
into
a
snifter
the
aroma
was
an
immediate
pineapple
scent
by
far
this
was
the
highlight
for
me
giving
a
slight
head
the
ale
was
a
pale
yellow
with
a
moderate
degree
of
cloudiness
the
first
taste
sensation
was
a
mild
banana
flavor
which
did
not
last
long
of
course
this
was
the
belgian
yeast
shining
though
the
banana
was
accompanied
by
a
tart
woody
flavor
with
a
lemon
notes
in
some
ways
the
lemon
reminded
me
of
a
saison
the
flavors
were
balanced
on
an
earthy
backbone
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
it
became
obvious
that
this
was
a
pale
ale
at
this
point
this
belgian
pale
ale
was
a
unique
experience
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
found
myself
wanting
more
from
the
beer
the
belgian
yeasts
seemed
smothered
by
the
other
flavors
o
a
terrific
beer
with
a
completely
unique
flavor
profile
the
earthiness
of
from
the
yeast
hops
and
brett
make
for
a
terrific
inyourface
drinking
experience
do
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
is
like
a
kick
in
the
gonads
but
in
your
mouth
what
is
this
subsequent
imbibing
produces
a
flurry
of
happy
chemical
release
in
my
brain
really
like
nothing
ive
had
before
this
is
classic
highly
recommended
for
belgian
beer
fans
update
as
i
continue
to
drink
it
its
been
about
an
hour
now
the
yeast
really
dominates
the
flavor
almost
as
if
its
totally
consumed
the
malt
still
some
hops
o
a
very
solid
belgian
pale
sweetness
and
bitterness
and
balanced
very
nicely
here
and
this
is
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
o
duvel
with
hops
a
primo
brew
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
a
try
a
great
celebration
sipper
fill
out
your
belgian
dance
card
with
this
old
school
flavorite
o
featuring
an
old
school
character
an
amazing
appearance
and
a
great
taste
this
beer
is
such
an
experience
unfortunately
the
mineral
and
acid
flavors
are
not
my
cup
of
tea
orval
either
has
a
recent
quality
control
problem
or
they
have
intentionally
changed
their
brew
in
either
case
im
unhappy
bring
back
the
old
orval
please
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
it
was
smooth
and
crisp
and
a
lighter
body
than
most
belgian
beers
back
to
the
beer
store
to
pick
up
more
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
loves
good
belgian
beers
oi
have
never
had
a
belgian
pale
ale
before
i
have
had
a
handful
of
other
belgians
though
and
this
is
much
different
not
in
a
bad
way
though
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
nothing
incredible
i
would
prefer
an
amercan
pale
ale
but
this
is
still
a
very
fine
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
at
anytime
overall
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
id
like
it
better
without
the
spices
i
may
try
aging
one
or
more
of
my
4
pack
to
see
how
it
changes
looks
gorgeous
rubypear
with
frothy
dollops
of
offwhite
goodness
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
on
the
nose
is
some
kind
of
white
wine
character
grapes
bitter
fruits
etc
plenty
of
hop
presence
with
some
estery
goodness
in
there
certainly
is
a
unique
tasting
beer
not
quite
as
vibrant
as
i
was
hoping
the
notes
that
build
the
aroma
just
arent
here
on
the
palate
this
one
has
a
year
on
it
so
i
guess
this
beer
might
just
be
in
an
awkward
phase
because
the
look
and
smell
suggest
something
greater
and
more
pronounced
perhaps
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappists
which
isnt
saying
much
at
all
the
most
unique
beer
ever
simply
a
joy
to
behold
and
to
drink
o
truly
a
quality
old
standby
however
despite
reports
ive
read
to
the
contrary
i
dont
think
the
extended
cellaring
did
the
beer
any
favors
drink
truly
a
classic
a
well
rounded
beer
with
large
and
balanced
flavors
the
aroma
alone
is
intoxicating
the
layers
transform
flawlessly
i
waited
until
i
got
my
hands
on
an
orval
chalice
before
i
reviewed
this
its
a
hard
one
to
age
because
you
just
want
to
drink
it
in
a
league
of
its
own
a
true
classic
dryfinish
and
wonderful
washingpowder
aroma
gorgeous
offwhite
head
mouthfeel
that
is
creamy
and
light
all
at
the
same
time
i
cant
really
describe
it
fully
you
can
drink
one
or
you
can
drink
five
though
its
quite
a
bit
stronger
than
say
your
average
pilsner
and
you
do
so
at
your
own
risk
all
i
can
say
is
that
its
the
only
beer
logo
i
am
considering
tattooing
on
my
body
thats
how
much
i
adore
and
revere
this
beer
my
favorite
trappist
handsdown
at
first
almost
abrasive
with
carbonation
i
stirred
the
carbonation
out
and
i
like
it
much
more
lots
of
yeast
flavors
fruity
and
acidic
pleasant
booze
character
brett
flavor
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
aftertaste
is
great
has
some
body
to
it
considering
the
sour
fermentation
really
unique
beer
and
surprisingly
refreshing
considering
the
abv
this
is
my
first
orval
i
like
it
o
i
was
impressed
by
the
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
the
flavor
had
all
of
the
elements
i
was
looking
for
but
there
was
an
additional
astringent
aftertaste
i
was
not
pleased
with
i
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
especially
at
5
99
for
an
11
oz
bottle
i
may
try
it
again
at
some
point
to
see
if
the
aftertaste
is
typical
or
not
a
unique
beer
crisp
light
on
hops
some
complexity
overall
decent
light
belgium
the
carbonation
takes
away
from
the
taste
and
feel
o
a
very
fine
beer
and
one
to
try
if
you
like
belgians
this
one
has
a
lot
of
complexity
going
on
as
well
so
its
something
to
sip
and
enjoy
orval
the
bottle
says
sole
importers
of
merchant
du
vin
corp
tukwila
wa
very
tasty
and
unique
from
the
other
trappist
products
impressed
yes
thrilled
probably
not
next
time
i
will
enjoy
in
a
tulip
to
capture
all
the
aromas
overall
an
amazing
ale
a
great
and
tasty
mix
of
fruits
with
just
enough
spice
and
hops
to
keep
things
in
check
this
beer
is
flat
out
amazing
i
love
it
im
biased
whatever
aroma
a
nicely
planned
aroma
including
fruity
bready
and
funk
attributes
throughout
sweet
to
the
nose
as
well
this
beer
has
an
interesting
combination
of
appetizing
dryness
and
slight
acidic
sourness
the
sourness
is
not
biting
but
rather
just
a
bit
of
a
pinch
to
add
to
the
finish
and
let
you
know
its
there
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
beer
but
it
is
a
world
classic
and
something
for
beer
lovers
to
revisit
from
time
to
time
i
really
enjoy
this
belgian
and
its
complexity
overall
a
truely
enjoyable
beer
when
your
in
the
mood
for
something
from
overseas
doa
d
definitely
feeling
a
little
underwhelmed
by
orval
while
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ales
this
one
wasnt
really
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
i
suppose
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
once
and
maybe
ill
even
revisit
it
again
with
a
rereview
down
the
road
but
until
then
orval
will
sit
comfortably
behind
the
likes
of
finer
belgian
ales
out
there
for
me
m
light
carbonation
with
a
smooth
feel
with
a
small
bite
right
in
the
middle
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
tanakaya
in
mejiro
tokyo
poured
it
into
a
trappistes
rochefort
goblet
amazing
thick
head
that
settles
and
remains
for
the
life
of
the
brew
in
a
fried
egg
pattern
with
a
thick
yolk
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
that
thins
out
from
there
the
smell
is
the
first
thing
that
embraces
me
as
i
pour
it
amazingly
strong
and
pleasant
the
taste
is
equally
wonderful
a
strong
barley
base
with
fruity
notes
of
apple
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
still
pleasant
in
how
it
foamed
back
up
in
the
mouth
a
bit
overall
another
great
belgian
trappist
brew
to
add
to
the
list
this
was
very
mild
i
can
tell
that
there
are
complexities
in
here
but
its
hard
to
coax
out
of
the
glass
i
get
more
malt
aroma
with
a
good
swirl
which
showcases
the
grains
well
but
the
yeast
really
doesnt
stand
out
as
much
as
i
think
it
should
i
feel
pretentious
saying
how
this
beer
should
be
brewed
one
that
has
been
brewed
for
hundreds
of
years
but
hey
its
how
i
feel
im
thinking
this
was
built
up
too
much
for
me
and
i
wanted
more
complexity
its
a
great
belgian
pale
but
nothing
spectacular
o
great
beer
a
very
well
done
trappist
beer
im
really
glad
this
is
available
at
the
local
bottleshop
because
i
have
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
this
beer
nice
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
flavors
o
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
it
is
very
easy
to
appreciate
very
complex
and
balanced
despite
the
intensity
of
its
flavors
the
measuring
stick
for
belgian
pales
o
doing
a
formal
review
only
confirms
why
this
is
a
classic
it
also
reaffirms
why
one
could
argue
that
this
is
the
class
of
the
trappist
ales
and
why
it
remains
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
i
cant
believe
i
went
a
year
or
two
without
having
it
this
should
be
in
both
my
refrigerator
and
cellar
at
all
times
as
i
pour
into
my
goblet
orval
appears
as
a
beautiful
shade
of
clear
copper
topped
with
a
very
puffy
1
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
rich
and
complex
im
picking
up
spices
a
yeasty
farmhouse
funk
sugary
malt
and
various
fruits
including
greensour
apple
lemon
and
banana
whats
nice
about
experiencing
this
beer
is
that
the
initial
flavor
and
feel
is
crisp
and
peppery
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
and
the
finish
is
a
nice
banana
bread
aftertaste
absolutely
delicious
and
drinkable
anytime
one
of
my
favorite
beers
bottom
line
you
want
a
world
class
beer
look
no
further
o
wow
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
beer
this
much
id
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
this
against
but
this
really
is
astounding
o
a
great
tasting
beer
that
offers
great
subtle
complexities
of
the
trappist
style
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
a
go
to
belgian
if
seen
at
a
bar
i
wont
hesitate
to
order
me
on
excellent
bpa
the
hops
shine
but
are
subtle
and
blend
well
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
d
this
is
very
different
from
the
other
trappist
beers
ive
had
to
date
the
hop
character
is
interesting
and
its
easy
to
drink
although
its
not
my
favorite
trappist
beer
i
think
its
definitely
worth
a
try
thanks
to
jason
at
epps
beverage
for
this
bottle
o
this
is
a
fantastic

this
is
an

incredibly
complex

balanced
after
3
years
of
age
i
will
definitely
pick
up
a
fresh
bottling
of
this
to
compare
how
the
brett
transforms
it
served
from
a
bottle
into
an
orval

color
the
nose
is
slightly
vegetal

has
layers
of

lemon
and
dried
herbs
a
touch
of
honey
on

a
favorite
o
a
beer
for
a
reason
pretty
darn
delicious
and
spot
on
o
a
pretty
obviously
high
quality
brew
apparently
these
trappist
folks
know
what
the
hell
theyre
doing
haha
not
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
but
its
definitly
top
three
highly
recommended
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
pale
definitely
one
i
will
seek
out
again

a

3
finger
white
billowing
head
supreme
retention
and
excellent

looks

the
aroma
filled
my
office
upon
pouring
powerful
sweet
flavors
and
yeasty
with
a
mix
of
floral
hops
clove
apricot
and
banana
very
similar
to
the
nose
very
balanced
between
the
malty
sweetness
yeasty
fruitiness
and
mild
bitterness
sharp
and
crisp
perfect
carbonation
for
the
style
overall
very
good
beer
would
happily
pour
another
if
i
had
one
poured
into
a
chalice
the
head
just
explodes
on
this
beer
i
served
mine
at
about
52f
and
it
seems
to
be
the
near
perfect
temperature
to
experience
the
wonderful
head
the
appearance
is
a
darkish
orange
with
lots
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the
chalice
i
did
not
observe
any
floating
yeast
the
scent
is
all
apple
and
some
dark
fruit
this
beer
literally
explodes
on
the
tongue
with
the
taste
following
the
scent
of
apple
and
dark
fruit
a
bit
of
hops
and
bitterness
and
sweetness
simultaneously
the
carbonation
is
pronounced
i
could
easily
drink
this
one
as
a
session
beer
but
for
my
taste
it
is
too
special
to
do
so
one
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
ever
experienced
overall
an
excellent
belgian
pale
ale
for
sessions
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
would
enjoy
every
drop
another
outstanding
trappist
ale
a
new
favorite
o
this
is
a
good
trappist
not
my
favorite
that
i
have
had
yet
but
it
is
up
against
tough
company
o
a
very
good
belgian
beer
i
would
like
to
try
different
ages
of
this
beer
to
explore
the
flavors
develop
over
time
my
beer
was
fairly
young
so
i
think
it
could
definitely
get
more
interesting
overall
a
great
beer
defiantly
one
that
doesnt
appeal
to
the
masses
but
perfect
for
those
looking
for
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
neither
too
think
nor
too
thin
could
linger
in
the
palate
a
little
longer
overall
ive
been
an
avid
beer
drinker
for
a
few
years
now
and
always
read
about
how
good
this
beer
was
for
some
reason
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
pick
one
up
for
7
bucks
a
bottle
i
finally
did
and
wow
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
ive
ever
had
the
chance
to
try
so
complex
with
a
ton
of
nuances
i
am
a
privileged
man
orval
trappist
ale
is
a
very
nice
occasional
beer
in
my
opinion
other
trappists
have
more
to
offer
but
none
are
as
refreshing
as
this
a
great
beer
with
more
complexity
to
shake
a
stick
at
but
at
the
same
time
easy
to
understand
why
some
people
especially
beer
rookies
dont
get
in
the
first
time
around
fine
backbone
with
a
glorious
array
of
spicy
herbal
hops
this
does
the
business
and
does
so
with
dignity
o
easy
drinking
big
flavor
very
smooth
balanced
and
complex
great
nose
and
feel
will
buy
this
again
o
a
very
nice
clean
and
simple
trappist
beer
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
done
the
belgian
way
overall
what
a
great
beer
stands
apart
from
most
trappists
with
the
light
sourness
and
funk
just
beautiful
o
good
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
talk
that
ive
seen
and
heard
about
it
not
nearly
the
brett
bomb
that
its
been
described
as
good
beer
a
classic
but
not
sure
that
id
drink
another
one
fresh
i
may
buy
another
and
sit
it
in
the
fridge
for
a
couple
years
and
see
how
it
progresses
d
a
remarkable
and
complex
beer
thats
highly
drinkable
from
my
limited
experience
with
trappist
offerings
its
certainly
unique
id
love
to
age
this
one
pours
a
nice
rich
mahogany
with
a
ton
of
off
white
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
nose
is
slightly
tart
up
front
with
some
fresh
green
apple
followed
with
a
funky
woodsiness
i
imagine
a
mushroom
growing
on
a
slightly
rotted
out
log
i
get
just
a
little
bit
of
a
flowery
soft
scent
like
lavender
the
taste
was
good
but
i
marked
it
lower
than
the
nose
because
i
am
getting
a
harshflat
bitterness
like
aspirin
left
to
dissolve
in
the
mouth
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
very
thin
combined
with
the
very
active
and
prickly
carbonation
this
felt
more
like
a
soda
which
really
detracted
from
the
taste
as
i
let
it
warm
up
the
mouthfeel
is
improving
and
i
am
able
to
taste
more
balance
but
it
is
still
not
quite
there
for
me
this
one
might
just
have
a
bit
too
much
age
on
it
3
years
and
the
brett
has
thrown
it
out
of
balance
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
a
great
beer
and
a
true
classic
the
carbonation
was
just
a
tad
bit
higher
then
i
would
have
liked
but
was
still
enjoyable
o
been
hanging
onto
this
for
a
little
while
now
and
looking
forward
to
drinking
it
being
that
the
ny
football
giants
just
won
i
am
indulging
excellent
balance
and
taste
to
this
you
can
almost
feel
the
history
and
tradition
while
sipping
worth
that
world
class
distinction
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
i
have
to
admit
that
there
are
a
lot
of
belgian
strong
ales
which
i
dont
get
duvel
tastes
like
overcarbonated
heineken
to
me
i
dont
see
the
magic
in
chimay
red
but
this
one
is
different
it
really
balances
all
of
what
makes
belgian
pales
what
they
are
the
complexity
and
unique
flavors
imparted
largely
by
the
yeast
and
fermentation
while
remaining
accessible
and
very
drinkable
it
just
tastes
good
o
easily
a
top
example
of
the
style
always
amazing
and
worth
trying
o
this
beer
is
like
no
other
out
there
that
i
have
come
across
its
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
a
certain
percentage
of
people
will
not
appreciate
it
may
even
be
said
to
have
an
acquired
taste
while
i
find
this
beer
a
bit
pricey
i
do
enjoy
revisiting
it
from
time
to
time
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
maybe
not
the
the
best
belgian
out
there
but
it
is
different
from
other
ones
and
a
beer
that
everyone
should
try
o
really
enjoyed
this
brew
although
i
have
certainly
enjoyed
other
beers
more
but
i
would
say
everyone
should
try
this
atleast
once
m
tart
bubbly
and
extremely
dry
orval
reveals
something
different
every
time
ive
had
it
every
experience
enjoyable
a
truly
unique
belgian
ale
very
distinct
and
delicious
taste
is
basically
yeast
i
cant
get
over
the
yeast
it
fills
my
mouth
entirely
leaving
no
room
for
any
other
flavors
tone
down
the
yeast
and
this
might
be
a
great
beer
but
as
is
not
so
much
to
me
this
succeeds
at
being
many
things
at
once
but
i
dont
feel
its
really
exceptional
on
any
level
ive
enjoyed
the
5
month
and
13
month
old
bottles
ive
had
recently
which
were
massively
different
but
there
are
certainly
better
trappist
ales
better
dry
brett
golden
ales
better
belgian
pale
ales
out
there
this
is
pretty
notable
in
its
transcendence
but
its
not
straightforward
enough
for
me
i
suppose
the
flavor
is
light
and
clean
it
is
a
great
example
of
a
well
made
belgian
beer
this
is
one
of
those
great
examples
why
everyone
thinks
so
highly
of
belgian
made
beers
strong
fruit
nose
strong
sour
apple
but
clearly
the
intended
flavor
balanced
bitterness
very
clean
mouth
feel
no
lingering
after
taste
overall
a
great
belgian
ale
there
are
few
i
have
enjoyed
more
it
is
my
favorite
of
the
trappist
ales
i
have
had
certainly
the
most
unique
perfect
balance
meets
brettanomyces
overall
lives
up
to
its
reputation
a
great
ale
with
an
amazing
smell
and
good
taste
highly
recommended
hoppy
maybe
a
bit
too
astringent
fruity
spicy
sweet
yet
dry
just
really
interesting
and
complex
the
brett
is
more
subtle
but
present
whats
not
to
love
amazing
beer
o
is
this
a
bad
bottle
maybe
this
was
a
huge
and
expensive
disappointment
tons
of
nondescript
bitterness
if
only
the
taste
matched
the
aroma
i
could
not
finish
this
overall
this
is
indeed
a
fantastic
beer
although
it
has
failed
to
overtake
nocturnum
as
my
favorite
beer
perhaps
it
is
unfair
to
compare
the
two
the
orval
is
definitely
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
but
im
a
sucker
for
belgian
strong
darks
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
any
fan
of
pale
ales
bottle
is
16
months
old
and
has
aged
very
well
love
the
hints
of
brett
in
the
nose
complex
and
flavorful
beer
this
is
delish
had
this
last
night
after
a
long
time
without
having
one
5
at
stoneys
liquor
store
in
indianapolis
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
has
a
nice
sourness
and
dry
hop
presence
poured
really
foamy
had
to
let
it
settle
23
times
to
get
the
tall
drinking
glass
filled
this
is
a
classic
no
doubt
about
it
i
love
the
simple
presentation
of
the
label
and
rarely
for
me
the
lack
of
a
totally
in
your
face
flavor
this
has
a
nice
subtlety
its
hard
to
beat
when
it
comes
to
belgians
if
youre
looking
for
something
on
the
dryer
side
thanks
for
reading
drink
one
soon
o
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
beer
for
a
special
occasion
deep
interesting
and
ever
so
complex
i
would
love
to
have
a
ton
and
chug
it
and
i
would
love
to
have
just
one
and
savor
it
for
a
couple
hours
which
is
what
im
doing
now
a
wonderful
beer
until
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
thought
this
beer
was
fairly
average
then
i
poured
in
the
last
of
the
beer
along
with
the
yeast
sediment
on
the
bottom
a
nice
complex
bluecheese
like
flavour
came
through
taking
this
beer
to
another
level
drinkability
extremely
high
but
take
it
slow
its
extraordinary
cold
but
even
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
if
you
like
it
i
suggest
you
to
try
strieul
triple
which
is
really
enjoyable
too
i
had
an
aged
threeyear
old
version
of
this
and
it
was
so
complex
and
delicious
very
smooth
and
yeasty
earthy
a
hint
of
tart
well
hmm
ive
waited
a
long
time
to
try
orval
and
i
respect
its
pedigree
but
i
have
to
say
i
expected
more
its
a
little
too
bitter
dry
and
lacking
in
flavor
for
my
tastes
overall
very
fascinating
beer
i
have
two
one
to
age
and
one
to
drink
now
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
comes
of
the
other
bottle
served
at
cellar
temp
from
bottle
poured
into
wide
mouth
goblet
upon
opening
the
bottle
it
hisses
a
very
healthy
carbonation
and
smells
of
yeast
lemongrass
and
a
very
clean
musty
attic
a
clean
pour
with
no
sediment
shows
just
how
very
carbonated
this
beer
is
and
results
with
a
very
large
head
that
crackles
and
pops
receding
into
a
great
bubbling
lace
a
minute
after
the
pour
i
put
my
head
close
to
the
glass
and
the
beer
is
still
bubbling
and
talking
to
me
aromas
from
the
glass
are
pale
malt
and
cream
beer
drinks
very
dry
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
a
pucker
at
the
end
but
not
in
a
sour
way
at
all
almost
like
hay
dirt
mushrooms
and
a
very
very
good
bread
of
a
type
that
i
have
never
had
before
i
am
not
experienced
with
brettanomyces
but
i
think
that
is
what
this
is
and
is
flourishing
in
this
beer
the
beer
was
bottled
on
29072009
and
that
would
explain
this
it
is
all
very
enjoyable
and
makes
me
ponder
at
the
end
of
every
sip
and
i
very
much
like
this
beer
so
very
smooth
with
no
noticable
alcohol
i
could
chug
this
beer
if
i
wanted
to
quite
easily
but
that
is
not
what
i
want
to
do
then
it
would
be
gone
and
i
would
be
sad
this
beer
is
forcing
me
to
enjoy
it
and
i
am
sipping
it
slower
than
any
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
the
bretty
flavor
stays
in
your
mouth
long
after
last
sip
is
gone
and
that
makes
this
beer
all
the
more
valuable
a
beer
that
keeps
entertaining
the
tastebuds
even
after
its
gone
orval
trappists
you
have
created
a
truly
great
beer
and
its
no
wonder
you
only
make
two
different
beers
no
need
to
make
any
more
when
you
nail
one
perfectly
a
5
out
of
5
this
beer
gave
me
the
impression
that
was
much
stronger
than
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
while
the
taste
isnt
for
everyone
this
has
a
classic
appeal
to
it
based
on
the
cloudy
hue
and
flavors
that
might
not
appeal
to
the
hophead
or
extreme
beer
fanatic
the
complex
taste
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
lead
to
a
slow
session
thats
every
bit
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
any
lover
of
beer
owes
it
to
him
or
herself
to
try
and
enjoy
this
odthis
trappist
beer
goes
down
super
easy
crisp
tart
and
unique
i
found
it
to
be
a
pleasurable
drink
to
say
the
least
surprised
i
havent
had
this
before
not
as
good
as
duvel
in
my
opinion
by
a
great
alternative
pretty
pleased
with
this
i
have
a
thought
as
to
some
places
that
may
carry
some
even
older
bottles
so
ill
seek
more
out
freshies
too
quite
delightful
and
very
interesting
o
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
but
this
is
a
good
beer
im
having
trouble
picking
out
individual
flavors
and
i
have
little
grounds
for
comparison
its
good
and
i
think
i
may
develop
a
taste
belgian
styles
sometime
so
until
then
its
just
good
and
nothing
better

cloudy
2
finger

had
strong

smell
even
got
some
hubba
bubba
first
mouthfull
was
very
sweet
but
the
bitterness
increased
with
every
sip
tasted
of
roasted
malts
some
charcol
this
beer
didnt
taste
like
other
belgian
beers
ive
sampled
i
thought
it
was
more
like
an
esb
overall
looked
like
a
hefeweizen
tasted
like
an
english
strong
ale
and
smelled
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
i
bought
a
4
pack
and
will
lay
down
at
least
two
before
drinking
again
took
me
a
while
to
find
one
in
spain
but
i
am
closing
in
on
all
the
trappistes
pours
an
orangish
clout
into
my
chalice
with
nice
lacing
and
long
lasting
head
of
a
light
golden
color
smells
somewhat
cider
like
and
not
too
overpowering
taste
is
very
good
some
bitterness
and
tartness
like
a
pear
or
apple
cider
and
some
phenol
and
medicinal
qualities
very
quaffable
body
is
medium
with
continuous
carbonation
but
in
a
good
way
i
will
definitely
stock
up
next
time
i
find
this
at
al
campo
salud
overall
its
really
a
good
beer
im
gonna
age
them
more
this
is
a
beer
that
shouldnt
be
taken
for
granted
o
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
by
far
not
the
worst
i
would
recommend
this
to
an
experience
beer
drinker
a
novice
would
not
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
its
worth
overall
a
very
fine
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
complex
but
smooth
as
it
goes
down
there
is
a
multitude
of
different
levels
of
flavor
and
feel
as
i
stated
i
prefer
this
beer
when
the
brett
shines
through
and
i
know
what
it
can
be
this
fresh
is
still
a
tasty
beer
and
a
nice
treat
conclusion
a
beer
that
is
complex
enough
to
enjoy
the
tasting
as
well
as
smooth
enough
to
follow
with
another
in
the
evening
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
fine
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
it
feels
a
bit
special
being
one
of
the
trappist
beers
love
it
but
who
doesnt
great
trappist
ale
with
a
sweet
finish
and
a
very
round
mouthfeel
that
cloudy
amber
coloring
is
classic
with
a
bit
of
a
citrussy
sweeter
aroma
its
well
worth
stocking
up
your
cellar
to
age
some
of
it
for
later
if
youve
never
had
one
then
please
wait
no
longer
o
very
good
o
this
is
my
first
trappist
beer
and
i
like
it
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
flavor
to
it
ill
be
trying
more
this
bottle
is
about
a
year
old
it
has
lost
the
fresh
herbal
notes
but
has
only
just
started
to
develop
complexity
from
aging
overall
a
refreshing
classy
beer
though
not
amazing
to
me
o
a
classic
belgian
the
old
mustiness
combined
with
the
tart
strawberry
is
a
beautiful
mix
great
beer
medium
body
ridiculously
high
carbonation
prickly
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
this
has
the
potential
to
be
great
but
theres
definitely
some
really
obvious
flaws
started
off
looking
and
smelling
fantastic
but
ultimately
didnt
live
up
to
that
initial
impression
purchased
this
for
the
first
time
finally
mainly
because
of
the
bowling
pin
shaped
bottle
and
because
because
the
store
had
the
orval
goblet
next
to
it
for
4
99
also
has
a
bottled
on
date
of
22042010
pours
out
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
the
thickest
three
finger
bright
white
head
i
have
ever
seen
the
head
slowly
settles
to
an
uneven
foam
resting
atop
the
beer
for
the
remainder
of
the
drink
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
fruits
yeast
and
a
little
spice
also
has
a
little
funk
to
it
but
not
in
a
bad
way
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
body
with
a
rich
creamieness
that
is
overtaken
by
a
slight
hop
bite
with
a
dry
finish
but
very
minimal
bitterness
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
worlds
best
do
i
wish
i
had
waited
for
this
to
age
a
little
no
i
like
to
be
able
to
taste
what
the
base
of
this
beer
is
before
the
bugs
have
there
way
with
it
do
i
wish
i
had
a
2
year
old
bottle
to
follow
this
one
up
with
absolutely
unfortunately
i
dont
great
beer
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
like
it
so
much
this
makes
for
a
nice
sitbackandrelax
beer
while
still
giving
a
complex
tasting
overall
one
of
the
best
trappist
ales
out
there
and
my
personal
favorite
trappist
brew
o
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
this
is
so
complex
but
also
somehow
really
well
balanced
im
going
to
get
this
again
and
again
and
again
o
sometimes
i
feel
like
people
in
america
assume
that
since
a
beer
is
from
belgium
it
must
be
good
there
is
no
mistaking
orval
it
is
very
good
the
beer
is
balanced
and
elegant
and
it
easy
blends
a
higher
alcohol
percentage
lovely
flavors
continue
to
develop
as
the
beer
warms
it
truly
is
a
a
winner
overall
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
probably
the
most
unique
of
all
the
trappist
beers
orval
is
funky
in
a
good
way
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
try
overall
a
great
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
delicious
it
will
definitely
be
showing
up
in
the
fridge
again
overall
this
is
a
unique
belgian
and
a
real
treat
o
a
very
beautifully
built
beer
with
nice
restraint
not
my
favorite
trappist
but
a
unique
variation
among
its
brethren
clean
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
flavors
are
really
sharply
defined
and
just
excellent
id
prefer
this
over
the
many
saisons
and
other
brett
beers
on
the
scene
today
does
the
trick
in
terms
of
taste
and
refreshment
a
classic
for
a
reason
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
this
definitely
has
the
potential
to
become
a
session

and

classic

belgian
pale
with
funk
in
my
opinion
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
unique
trappist
ale
and
will
go
back
to
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
pale
the
yeast
spice
was
strong
but
balanced
well
with
all
the
other
flavors
very
well
done
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
an
orval
this
reminded
me
quickly
that
my
next
one
should
be
a
lot
sooner
food
match
it
is
a
challenging
beer
to
food
match
the
boldness
of
the
bitterdry
profile
makes
it
a
perfect
match
with
bold
cheeses
much
like
a
red
wine
also
venison
and
game
meats
would
work
well
o
i
never
wouldve
imagined
such
a
simple
trappist
ale
could
be
so
flavorful
and
pleasant
im
quite
surprised
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
id
recommend
particularly
to
fans
of
saison
ales
glad
i
finally
had
this
i
must
say
didnt
live
up
to
admittedly
very
high
expectations

not

gotta
be
honest
this
beer
underwhelmed
me
and
was
not
worth
the
elevated
price
o
not
my
favorite
trappist
beer
although
its
almost
its
own
style
very
refreshing
not
too
heavy
but
it
lacks
a
bold
flavor
nice
availability
in
my
area
so
i
will
probably
pick
it
up
again
d
this
was
certainly
my
favorite
trappist
beer
these
monks
know
how
to
brew
beer
enjoyed
with
a
cone
of
belgian
fries
this
is
heaven
o
i
love
this
beer
had
it
so
many
times
before
today
with
out
reviewing
it
but
finally
brought
a
bottle
home
to
review
and
each
time
i
have
it
i
like
it
more
a
complex
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
its
going
down
great
after
a
long
day
a
of
work
man
the
nose
really
had
me
going
but
the
taste
didnt
follow
through
bummed
overall
experience
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
i
will
be
bringing
it
to
all
social
gathering
im
sorry
but
if
this
doesnt
make
you
want
to
drop
that
commercial
beer
and
make
the
switch
i
dont
know
what
will
the
cloud
like
head
the
overflowing
floral
aroma
the
complexity
its
all
amazing
d
pretty
drinkable
overall
or
should
i
say
orval
i
like
it
a
lot
overall
yeah
this
beer
does
deserve
its
high
grades
theres
not
much
out
there
cant
think
of
anything
that
is
like
this
beer
you
have
to
at
least
try
it
especially
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
beer
overall
this
is
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
yearround
alwaysavailable
beers
why
dont
i
have
a
case
of
this
at
the
ready
at
all
times
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
certainly
one
of
the
best
of
the
few
trappist
brews
and
one
of
my
new
top
favorites
poured
a
4
offwhite
head
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
color
smells
of
dried
fruits
and
a
little
funk
taste
has
the
fruits
a
little
caramel
malt
and
an
aspect
i
had
a
hard
time
describing
and
im
going
to
settle
on
almost
a
cola
type
flavor
and
sensation
add
a
pretty
long
finish
to
it
and
youve
got
one
classic
beer
o
some
of
the
best
beer
period
orval
is
amazing
almost
a
sweet
golden
pale
its
just
in
a
league
of
its
own
and
will
be
forever
in
my
mind
o
thats
a
quality
beer
and
no
mistake
its
far
too
easy
to
keep
going
back
to
the
glass
for
another
sip
but
at
least
its
not
up
there
in
the
abv
this
ones
going
to
be
burning
a
hole
in
my
pocket
from
now
on
dammit
an
excellent
beer
great
at
7
months
must
try
again
soon
d
quite
enjoyable
and
complex
but
in
a
relatively
accessible
fashion
this
is
a
unique
beer
im
a
bit
embarrassed
that
ive
never
tried
this
or
many
other
belgian
standards
before
o
an
extremely
easy
drinker
it
would
be
tough
to
sip
this
beer
because
it
almost
beckons
you
to
go
back
to
it
quickly
for
another
sip
fresh
is
unsurprising
and
five
years
apparently
isnt
enough
for
the
yeasts
to
do
any
thing
remarkable
other
glasses
of
orval
over
the
past
month
have
been
equally
unexciting
not
nearly
as
charming
as
i
thought
it
was
a
few
years
ago
just
a
beautiful
beer
and
the
benchmark
for
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
o
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
truly
a
classic
overall
excellent
unique
tastes
that
are
definitely
beer
but
not
present
in
any
other
beers
i
know
if
that
makes
any
sense
o
a
really
nice
well
balanced
beer
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
having
it
much
more
often
great
way
to
enter
into
the
trappists
o
textbook
belgian
this
beer
pours
a
nice
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smell
is
fruity
and
in
irony
with
hints
of
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
incredibly
fruity
with
the
first
sip
being
full
if
rich
tropical
fruit
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
decent
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
truly
a
unique
beer
a
must
have
for
any
beer
enthusiast
or
any
human
being
with
taste
buds
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
enjoy
this
seems
to
be
getting
better
with
very
sip
i
take
i
wish
that
it
was
as
sour
as
the
smell
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
this
is
a
beer
that
must
be
decanted
super
slowly
not
just
to
avoid
stirring
up
the
lees
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
also
because
it
has
an
inherent
tendency
to
foam
sure
enough
over
half
of
the
glass
was
initially
filled
with
dense
rocky
eggshellwhite
foam
that
was
okay
by
me
because
it
also
allowed
the
funk
of
the
strain
of
brettanomyces
yeast
that
they
use
to
fill
the
room
color

had
the
brett
funk
going
but
not
in
an
obtrusive
way
i
have
long
characterized
orval
as
brett
for
beginners
a
way
to
introduce
the
heretofore
uninitiated
to
the
wonders
of
brett
without
causing
them
to
turn
away
and
never
want
to
try
any
such
beer
again
i
think
of
jolly
pumpkin
beers
in
the
same
way
mouthfeel
was
quite
full
perhaps
due
to
the
large
co2
bubbles
inherent
in
the
beer
and
with
a
bitter
funky
flavor
that
is
unique
to
this
beer
i
cannot
adequately
describe
it
but
do
know
that

could
forsee
this

being
something
that
could

really
develop
into
something
completely
different

this

beer
any

cant
wait
to

a
summer
night

id
be
curious
to
see
what

do
to
this

a
unique
experience
overall
and
very
drinkable
if
not
for
the
elevated
price
found
the
texture
to
be
overly
thick
and
needing
more
carbonation
to
compliment
the
sharp
flavors

the
bottle
is
dated
7507
making
it
four
months
old
at
drinking
couldnt
wait
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
huge
billowy
head
leaving
remnants
of
lace
the
aroma
has
a
freshness
to
it
that
reminds
me
of
the
ocean
with
malt
fruitiness
underpinning
it
orvals
taste
is
of
mellow
black
cherries
and
plums
not
as
intense
as
the
american
brewed
belgianstyle
ommegang
that
i
am
more
familiar
with
but
seemingly
more
balanced
the
hops
add
some
bite
and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
the
intense
carbonation
does
not
bother
me
and
orval
seems
surprisingly
drinkable
first
time
ive
seen
the
stuff
and
now
im
kicking
myself
for
only
coming
home
with
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
orval
overall
speaking
of
pitchers
i
guess
im
in
the
minority
but
this
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
some
complexity
to
the
taste
but
the
taste
itself
kind
of
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
d
i
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
but
will
give
it
a
second
try
down
the
road
drinkability
for
me
is
quite
high
tastemouthfeel
very
dry
in
the
mouth
exhibiting
both
bitter
and
tart
flavors
its
fruity
but
not
sweet
at
all
it
has
more
of
a
sour
acidic
fruit
character
ample
hopping
lends
a
pinelike
flavor
slick
and
oily
on
the
tongue
with
a
longlasting
dry
finish
this
stuff
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
by
far
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
out
there
the
first
sip
seems
tart
and
then
warms
into
a
more
sweeter
flavor
almost
a
sticky
consistency
but
finished
quite
dry
i
loved
it
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
many
more
than
one
at
a
time
it
is
quite
a
beer
fairly
light
bodied
and
dries
the
mouth
out
a
bit
a
pretty
good
sipper
ill
be
nursing
this
one
for
sure
drinkability
a
must
drink
at
cellar
t
overall
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
trappist
beer
for
a
while
now
ever
since
i
bought
the
glass
to
match
it
the
sourness
is
a
little
too
tart
for
my
tastes
at
the
moment
this
is
a
very
subtle
beer
for
a
trappist
but
its
also
quite
different
sure
it
looks
fine
and
the
head
is
fine
but
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
good
it
is
earthy
and
flat
kind
of
burnt
there
is
no
complexity
and
nothing
notable
although
my
scores
may
not
seem
to
reflect
it
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
brew
just
based
on
my
taste
i
cant
rank
this
one
as
highly
as
multiple
other
belgian
ales
i
have
tried
pours
a
cloudy
dark
gold
with
a
huge
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
lacing
smells
huge
of
fruit
and
spice
bananas
pumpkin
some
musk
and
earth
taste
is
the
same
a
bubbly
spicy
fruity
concoction
pretty
dense
mouthfeel
crisp
and
well
carbonated
i
served
it
a
little
too
cold
and
it
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
up
my
first
impression
was
not
favorable
im
glad
i
let
it
warm
while
this
is
a
really
iteresting
beer
i
must
say
that
i
am
disappointed
in
my
own
review
points
i
thought
it
would
be
higher
but
the
last
couple
times
i
tried
it
it
was
after
i
had
had
a
few
other
brews
my
muddled
taste
buds
aside
a
very
interesting
brew
that
one
could
rereview
with
multiple
tastings
which
makes
it
worthy
of
the
fame
i
has
the
richness
color
lacing
mouthfeel
was
what
id
expect
from
a
belgian
trappist
i
also
noticed
the
nice
sweetness
and
spicyraisiny
flavors
but
there
was
a
flavor
in
there
that
absolutely
did
not
agree
with
me
the
closes
i
can
come
to
describing
it
is
a
combination
of
tar
and
burnt
plastic
i
guess
its
possible
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
if
this
is
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
it
is
an
acquired
taste
that
i
shall
not
pursue
this
was
a
huge
surprise
to
me
as
st
bernardus
abt
12
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
bottled
on
71106
orval
pours
a
cloudy
orangered
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
puffs
up
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
stays
put
the
aroma
is
crisp
earthy
and
almost
metallic
with
hints
of
hops
and
some
dry
dark
fruit
as
the
beer
warms
i
smell
a
nice
farmhouse
funkiness
what
i
assume
is
some
brett
character
the
flavor
is
dry
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
left
i
taste
a
nice
lemony
flavor
but
different
from
the
typical
citrus
flavors
from
hops
there
nice
dry
toasty
malt
flavor
with
light
yeasty
funk
more
earthy
flavors
the
beer
is
very
complex
and
delicious
im
not
even
getting
past
the
surface
on
all
the
different
flavors
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
gritty
like
there
is
a
lot
of
texture
to
the
beer
edit
8192010
found
a
stash
of
these
at
my
local
harris
teeter
that
are
almost
three
years
old
good
luck
finds
them
in
perfect
condition
i
know
the
brewery
thinks
that
they
taste
their
best
at
six
months
but
these
babies
are
awesome
real
bretty
funk
and
barn
abound
with
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
really
amazing
just
had
to
add
this
if
i
had
to
be
stranded
on
a
desert
island
with
one
beer
this
would
be
it
tastes
of
sour
fruits
a
good
amount
of
hops
earth
grass
and
the
horse
barn
aroma
comes
into
play
on
the
mouth
and
is
actually
enjoyable
has
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
one
hugely
flavourful
and
complex
beer
top
notch
this
is
my
first
orval
and
im
really
enjoying
it
its
definitely
not
your
runofmill
beer
it
makes
me
wonder
why
were
not
all
monks
the
smell
was
good
not
a
lot
of
hops
as
this
bottle
is
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
but
there
was
some
fruitiness
and
some
alcohol
in
the
smell
it
tastes
dry
fruity
with
some
alcohol
the
hops
on
this
have
definately
faded
with
age
i
hear
it
is
pretty
hoppy
when
it
is
fresh
it
is
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
by
the
time
i
was
finished
i
just
wanted
another
but
i
only
have
a
couple
so
i
have
to
ration
them
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
reviewed
on
here
in
which
i
did
not
particularly
care
for
the
beer
but
could
not
deny
the
quality
it
exhibited
this
is
a
fine
trappist
ale
is
there
any
other
that
most
would
be
happy
to
drink
its
just
not
my
cup
overall
this
is
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
it
caught
me
off
guard
not
at
all
like
any
other
trappist
ale
ive
had
highly
recommended
a
major
carbonation
buzz
going
on
in
this
one
medium
body
crisp
and
refreshing
great
taste
this
was
incredibly
unque
and
very
welcomed
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
orangered
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
firm
and
creamy
lacing
is
strong
and
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
banryard
hay
leather
lemon
tangerine
the
taste
is
of
a
bit
more
earty
than
the
aroma
with
less
of
the
zesty
lemon
and
tangerine
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
i
will
certainly
have
it
again
the
bottle
is
quite
cool
if
a
bit
pricey
and
interestingly
sports
a
bottled
on
date
and
a
consume
by
date
of
5
years
after
i
had
this
particular
one
almost
a
year
after
the
bottle
date
after
storing
in
the
fridge
poured
into
a
goblet
this
was
a
clear
amber
at
first
that
got
murkier
as
i
got
towards
the
end
of
a
slow
pour
i
left
most
of
the
large
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
huge
rocky
white
head
that
lasted
quite
some
time
as
bubbles
arose
in
a
fountain
from
the
bottom
center
of
the
chalice
thick
thick
lacing
not
surprisingly
this
had
a
very
complex
nose
of
caramel
toffee
alcohol
stone
fruits
and
a
lot
of
general
funkiness
taste
is
mostly
sour
throughout
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
in
this
allimportant
area
just
a
tinge
of
hop
bitterness
light
to
medium
in
body
and
effervescent
in
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
a
complex
sipper
pours
a
golden
copper
with
reddish
hues
it
will
be
very
clear
if
you
pour
correctly
leaving
the
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottle
however
i
enjoy
the
extra
bite
provided
by
the
sediment
i
like
it
hazy
and
thick
a
huge
rocky
foamy
whitish
head
mounds
over
the
beer
head
retention
is
astounding
the
head
lasts
forever
leaving
a
roadmap
of
lacing
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
very
pungent
of
spicy
hops
and
fruity
esters
taste
is
very
strong
and
full
of
fruity
esters
and
spicy
hops
very
full
and
complex
typical
of
the
belgian
trappist
brews
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
thin
with
a
high
carbonation
tingling
my
tongue
well
into
the
taste
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
simply
world
class
d
hmm
definitely
a
sipper
i
certainly
would
not
want
two
in
a
session
in
fact
a
couple
of
weeks
in
between
sounds
better
the
smell
and
taste
are
somewhat
citrusy
unfortunately
the
smell
is
better
than
the
taste
for
a
trappist
ale
this
beer
is
lacking
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
overall
i
prefer
the
other
trappist
ales
for
the
top
beer
in
its
category
on
ba
i
was
not
too
impressed
i
think
duvel
was
a
much
better
belgian
pale
ale
this
beer
was
very
drikable
and
aged
amazingly
well
with
no
hints
of
oxidation
though
not
overly
strong
this
is
the
rare
brew
where
i
find
myself
wanting
to
sip
and
enjoy
trying
in
vain
to
taste
all
that
is
there
a
single
bottle
is
very
drinkable
i
doubt
id
ever
session
this
but
id
be
willing
to
give
it
a
try
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
damn
well
balanced
beer
in
every
respect
not
overpowering
in
any
way
shape
or
form
just
solid
in
the
taste
department
every
respect
its
going
to
be
real
hard
to
top
this
one
nice
presentation
great
looking
brew
with
aromas
that
were
mouthwatering
earthy
malts
sweet
berry
lambic
sourness
and
a
yeasty
tang
mouthfeel
was
an
explosion
of
carbonation
very
light
and
airy
and
tongue
tingling
the
taste
was
missing
for
me
after
a
hit
of
hop
bitters
all
that
i
was
left
with
was
a
bready
yeasty
bitterness
and
some
grassy
watered
down
malts
i
was
dissapointed
as
the
flavors
could
not
even
hide
the
slight
abv
present
there
are
better
belgians
out
there
in
my
opinion
not
one
i
would
be
consuming
regularly
however
i
would
give
it
another
shot
if
only
to
see
if
the
bottle
i
had
was
offskunked
in
some
way
bitter
with
a
slight
vinuous
character
i
think
im
drinking
this
bottle
just
in
time
the
malt
profile
is
slight
as
is
the
moutheel
this
one
is
reasonably
refreshing
actually
ive
heard
this
is
a
love
or
hate
beer
but
im
not
sure
thats
the
case
for
me
i
dig
it
though
im
not
in
love
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
drinkability
i
wont
be
buying
one
of
these
for
a
long
time
i
dont
think
i
could
have
a
second
even
if
i
had
another
one
in
the
fridge
im
struggling
through
the
first
one
as
it
is
perhaps
it
drastically
improves
with
age
but
i
wont
be
trying
it
anytime
soon
bottled
on
29082006
it
will
be
almost
a
year
since
bottling
when
cracked
appearance
has
a
hazy

orange
with
a
real
thick
fluffy
head
smell
has
a
dry
citrus
aroma
along
with
some
sweet
spice
taste
is
dry
slightly
harshearthy
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
hop
and
carbonation
having
a
good
mouthfeel
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
not
what
i
expected
it
to
be
in
a
6
00
11
2oz
bottle
but
im
willing
to
give
it
another
try
in
a
well
aged
bottle
i
only
tried
an
orval
once
before
at
a
beer
bar
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
at
the
time
but
its
even
better
now
where
i
can
concentrate
and
fully
appreciate
everything
it
has
to
offer
one
of
my
all
time
favourites
unique
beer
on
the
whole
and
worth
the
experience
i
may
do
some
aged
orvals
in
future
a
nice
beer
but
a
bit
too
simple
to
compell
me
to
always
reach
for
a
glass
it
does
keep
its
head
above
water
however
mouth
dry
and
sour
crisp
and
foamy
and
chewy
strange
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
bret
is
more
present
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
bitter
melon
rind
taste
mellows
as
it
warms
perhaps
a
dry
bramble
taste
i
was
able
to
finish
it
though
i
hope
i
simply
had
an
old
bottle
and
will
try
another
at
some
time
d
aside
from
somewhat
strong
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
a
fine
ale
that
id
gladly
try
again
overall
im
very
satisfied
with
this
orval
d
for
me
this
is
a
beautifully
drinkable
beer
the
dryness
and
the
tart
earthy
flavors
make
it
a
wonderfully
refreshing
beer
best

initial

i
dont

how

of
these
could
be
enjoyed
in
one
sitting
i
tried
this
beer
on
july
23
2007
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
the
beer
was
bottled
on
november
16
2006
and
was
6
9
abv
as
opposed
to
6
2
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brownish
gold
with
a
head
that
lasted
through
the
entire
trappist
glass
the
carbonation
was
very
evident
in
the
glass
the
aroma
was
spicy
and
fruity
not
as
yeasty
as
an
abbey
quadrupel
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
taste
was
not
to
my
liking
the
upfront
taste
was
alright
but
there
was
a
limelike
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
very
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
for
me
i
highly
recommend
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
ive
had
this
beer
at
almost
a
year
old
before
and
it
does
not
compare
to
like
relatively
fresh
bottle
oelergud
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
among
the
trappists
this
beer
is
not
as
high
in
alcohol
content
and
is
very
refreshing
not
as
puckering
as
a
geueze
but
just
enough
sourness
to
give
it
a
subtle
uniqueness
vs
other
trappists
a
truely
unique
experience
from
start
to
finish
which
is
a
rare
find
the
complexities
in
this
beer
are
amazing
and
its
ridiculously
drinkable
this
should
be
a
mandatory
addition
to
every
bas
wants
list
unexceptional
trappist
ale
not
meant
really
to
wow
but
a
timeless
recipe
and
great
for
cooking
and
pairing
try
it
with
seared
pork
chops
garlic
mashed
potatoes
and
greens
d
at
6
2
alcohol
this
may
not
be
the
ideal
session
beer
down
with
that
theory
this
was
great
the
bottle
was
rendered
empty
before
i
knew
it
and
i
was
left
wanting
another
well
worth
the
price
and
i
will
be
buying
two
or
three
next
time
at
the
store
pours
a
cloudy
deep
copper
color
with
a
big
off
white
head
it
has
the
aroma
of
a
sweet
yeastiness
and
hops
a
small
amout
of
citrus
is
in
there
too
it
has
the
taste
of
hops
starts
kind
of
sweet
and
ends
dry
it
is
kind
of
yeasty
but
light
it
tickles
your
mouth
as
it
goes
down
love
the
dry
hopping
and
it
hides
its
alcohol
quite
well
a
unique
and
good
beer
quite
drinkable
the
bottle
is
gone
before
you
know
it
dry
almost
to
a
fault
though
edit
62010
looking
back
5
years
almost
since
i
first
had
orval
this
beer
is
king
at
its
peak
nothing
can
overcome
the
complexities
and
flavours
in
this
beer
are
just
incredible
i
dont
know
what
could
make
it
better
this
beer
is
almost
6
now
and
its
still
the
best
bargain
in
the
beer
world
if
there
is
anyone
on
the
fence
reading
this
go
for
it
the
6
you
pay
will
change
the
way
you
think
about
beer
forever
d
reasonable
id
have
another
one
or
two
perhaps
a
bit
overpowering
to
drink
for
an
entire
night
out
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
not
necessarily
a
huge
belgian
pale
ale
fan
but
tried
this
on
a
friends
suggestion
cheers
the
flavors
match
the
aroma
profile
very
pleasant
high
level
of
alcohol
warmth
a
touch
of
candy
sugar
sweetness
great
body
relatively
low
carbonation
light
dry
and
spritzy
on
the
tongue
rendering
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
complex
one
at
that
classic
and
so
unique
while
i
cant
say
id
enjoy
it
as
a
session
beer
i
do
find
it
to
be
a
good
drinker
the
mouth
feel
has
a
nice
complexity
to
it
but
im
not
partial
to
the
dry
finish
orval
is
a
very
unique
beer
from
the
bottle
to
the
flavor
theres
nothing
quite
like
it
that
said
as
finely
crafted
an
ale
as
it
is
its
not
for
everyone
its
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappist
ales
at
6
2
percent
easily
the
weakest
by
alcohol
and
drinkable
of
the
trappist
brews
i
have
had
thus
far
another
worldclass
brew
d
highly
drinkable
this
beer
finishes
so
smooth
that
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
more
exceptional
mix
of
flavors
that
is
not
overpowering
i
could
certainly
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
if
it
was
not
for
the
lofty
price
tag
drinkability
this
was
plain
and
simple
a
joy
to
drink
an
outstanding
depth
and
crisp
finish
may
this
a
wonderful
no
nonsense
offering
as
the
last
of
the
trappists
for
me
to
try
this
indeed
holds
a
place
in
the
pantheon
on
great
beers
one
of
my
top
20
all
time
poured
from
the
bottle
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
head
and
good
lacing
nose
of
yeast
and
fruits
sour
taste
and
some
citrus
sour
dry
and
bitter
finish
very
nice
to
drink
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
u
a
bit
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
buy
it
again
the
monks
can
do
no
wrong
at
least
thats
what
orval
has
led
me
to
believe
it
will
certainly
be
returning
to
my
fridge
in
the
very
near
future
pours
a
huge
head
that
looks
like
whipped
cream
w
an
orangish
color
smells
like
perfume
tastes
a
lot
like
perfume
prettier
than
it
needs
to
be
tastes
a
little
thin
for
a
trappist
ale
after
you
have
one
you
really
dont
look
forward
to
another
d
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
trying
good
every
now
and
then
but
i
can
certainly
see
why
it
wouldnt
appeal
to
some
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
i
more
then
likely
will
not
be
ordering
this
again
any
time
soon
rockin
ry
cooder
getzgilberto
on
the
playlist
poured
a
rustycolored
orval
into
my
tastin
glass
and
watched
it
take
its
precious
form
great
color
wonderful
head
visible
carbonation
and
a
swirling
yeasty
presence
that
reminded
me
of
the
fog
smell
is
simple
and
sweet
a
touch
of
watermelon
and
fine
malt
taste
is
conservative
compared
to
some
of
the
more
overthetop
offerings
found
in
the
motherland
but
refined
and
delicious
subdued
esters
and
a
nice
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
perfect
leathery
and
substantial
while
maintaining
is
soft
side
leather
and
lace
i
just
realized
that
aside
from
the
formidable
price
tag
that
would
be
involved
this
is
a
session
trappist
d
this
is
a
great
beer
my
only
problem
was
finding
a
suitable
pairing
for
it
i
think
if
you
match
this
beer
with
the
wrong
food
youre
going
to
lose
out
on
a
lot
of
the
subtleties
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
more
so
than
your
average
beer
id
like
to
try
some
fresh
orval
sometime
ive
read
that
they
add
the
brettanomyces
at
bottling
so
its
hoppier
and
less
funky
fresh
and
the
brett
becomes
stronger
over
time
the
brewer
said
he
likes
it
fresh
orval
trappist
ale
pours
a
light
to
medium
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
brown
eleven
point
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
complex
a
bit
winey
even
but
i
also
smell
banana
and
even
a
little
bit
of
barnyard
the
flavor
is
all
these
things
and
more
bubblegum
banana
wine
funk
its
all
here
and
then
some
really
a
singular
trappist
beer
nothing
else
is
like
it
i
havent
had
one
in
years
and
its
not
really
my
favorite
beer
but
its
a
must
try
peppery
taste
sorda
bitter
in
the
after
taste
yeasty
and
very
creamy
head
mouthful
is
delicate
and
heavenly
very
creamy
head
and
perfect
carb
and
thickness
good
beer
very
enjoyable
and
worth
the
price
i
drank
it
with
the
company
of
my
beutaful
girlfreind
and
a
nice
night
on
the
back
porch
i
will
look
for
this
beer
again
but
a
fresher
bottle
bottled
30605
best
by
30610
the
slightly
portly
bottle
a
classic
into
a
chalice
pours
a
lovely
golden
hue
lightening
around
the
edges
with
a
bubbly
inch
of
head
to
start
with
after
receding
to
a
thick
film
the
head
is
brought
back
with
a
modest
swirl
and
lacing
falls
in
sheets
the
aroma
though
not
very
assertive
pulls
one
into
the
beer
the
hops
take
on
a
grassy
feel
spice
and
noble
fruity
and
floral
but
coaxing
all
the
way
to
put
it
to
mouth
and
then
it
doesnt
disappoint
there
are
spices
aplenty
pairing
well
with
the
lemon
grassy
citric
hops
loads
of
bittering
involved
and
are
only
magnified
by
the
crazy
carbonation
the
body
is
deceivingly
light
not
so
much
for
malts
around
here
but
very
refreshing
and
the
dry
finish
leaves
you
craving
for
either
more
orval
or
more
cheese
which
im
eating
with
it
in
sum
while
not
my
favorite
belgian
nor
my
favorite
trappist
orval
is
a
hands
down
classic
and
definitely
worth
enjoying
every
so
often
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
what
took
me
so
long
poured
a
nice
honey
gold
into
a
snifter
leaving
a
short
white
head
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
slight
hops
citrus
some
funk
nice
the
taste
is
hard
for
me
to
pin
down
the
hops
stand
out
but
not
bitter
or
overly
tart
the
funk
is
there
but
stripped
down
not
picking
up
as
much
citrus
as
i
noticed
in
the
smell
some
white
pepper
maybe
i
like
this
a
lot
and
one
bottle
is
not
enough
mouthfeel
is
full
and
prickly
with
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
i
really
need
a
bomber
of
this
does
it
come
in
bombers
a
repeat
buy
for
sure
a
good
authentic
trappist
beer
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
worth
trying
11
2
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
12406
best
before
1242011
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
an
orangecopper
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
it
smells
fruitylemon
orange
plum
and
banana
spicy
peppery
and
herbalearthy
and
malty
theres
also
other
smells
that
i
cant
tell
exactly
what
they
are
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
smell
but
the
citrus
taste
is
the
strongest
theres
so
much
to
this
beer
its
pretty
hard
to
figure
it
all
out
if
that
makes
sense
at
all
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
it
has
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
decent
but
if
the
carbonation
was
cut
down
a
bit
it
woud
be
much
better
overall
id
still
drink
this
again
its
pretty
good
fairly
stunning
brew
that
really
makes
a
big
impression
too
complex
to
be
a
regular
but
one
to
savour
when
sampling
drinkability
is
good
too
considering
the
lower
abv
with
the
great
other
qualities
exhibited
d
an
extremely
unique
interesting
and
complex
beer
its
definitely
something
that
ill
have
again
but
will
likely
not
be
in
regular
rotation
the
complex
taste
makes
this
a
nice
sipping
beer
but
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
1
or
2
overall
im
not
sure
that
extended
aging
2
yrs
benefits
or
hinders
orval
its
slightly
different
but
not
enough
to
recommend
aging
for
longer
periods
though
unique
interesting
and
one
of
the
better
belgian
pale
ales
ive
had
i
still
cant
quite
get
into
it
its
a
nice
beer
and
ill
certainly
get
it
again
but
its
not
something
that
id
want
to
have
too
often
d
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
2
the
citrus
flavours
really
make
this
a
sipper
for
me
and
not
something
i
could
go
a
session
on
a
nice
one
for
a
summers
evening
where
you
just
want
one
or
two
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
dry
mouthfeel
from
start
to
finish
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
but
is
never
becomes
stinging
the
body
seems
to
be
on
the
lighter
side
this
might
be
due
to
carbonation
this
is
a
dam
fine
beer
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
have
this
one
again
while
not
on
par
with
other
trappists
beers
this
beer
is
set
apart
from
other
beers
of
the
style
by
the
complex
taste
and
originality
the
first
time
i
had
this
brew
it
seemed
like
i
was
drinking
battery
acid
the
bottle
must
have
been
infected
or
poorly
handled
this
time
around
it
was
a
much
better
experience
this
bpa
is
a
little
more
malt
oriented
than
others
with
esters
being
only
a
light
addition
to
the
background
the
fruity
esters
are
kicked
up
a
notch
with
the
addition
of
the
yeast
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
recommended
the
drinkability
for
this
is
as
high
as
it
gets
aside
from
perhaps
the
cost
the
taste
is
great
without
being
overwhelming
and
complex
enough
that
it
will
take
me
a
lifetime
to
figure
out
wow
this
is
one
of
the
traditional
belgiums
that
is
a
must
try
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
and
truly
unique
balgian
pale
ale
very
floral
and
bubbly
complex
and
delicious
notes
a
good
beer
but
a
little
pricey
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
but
i
wont
buy
it
all
the
time
drinks
fairly
easy
but
the
older
this
this
gets
the
better
it
is
a
little
too
prickly
when
young
i
guess
if
i
ever
find
this
again
i
need
to
cellar
it
for
2
years
minimum
well
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
its
also
a
bit
of
an
enigma
as
i
cant
seem
to
pinpoint
any
definite
taste
characteristics
i
know
that
brett
is
used
at
some
point
in
the
making
of
this
beer
so
maybe
thats
throwing
my
tastes
off
anyway
its
certainly
not
bad
and
actually
pretty
good
but
will
be
a
rare
purchase
for
me
in
the
future
ill
recommend
it
as
a
beer
to
try
at
least
once
d
this
is
pretty
different
for
a
trappist
beer
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
d
not
bad
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
especially
considering
the
price
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
orval
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
very
large
four
fingers
rocky
white
head
from
its
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
medicinal
with
notes
of
licorice
the
taste
is
also
medicinal
in
nature
with
notes
of
licorice
and
yeast
mouthfeel
is
very
good
filling
the
mouth
with
a
snappy
finish
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
sipper
recommended
outstanding
not
for
beginners
even
near
the
end
when
warming
a
good
deal
the
flavours
locked
in
this
beer
stay
just
there
inside
with
no
body
to
ride
on
its
hard
to
really
taste
much
of
anything
that
said
i
could
sit
and
sniff
this
one
all
day
smells
absolutely
brilliant
its
generally
quite
a
bland
tasting
beer
in
my
opinion
and
paired
with
its
overcarbonation
isnt
really
one
id
be
keen
to
enter
a
session
with
but
is
definately
something
to
try
not
my
favorite
trappist
but
still
an
interesting
brew
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
its
incredibly
drinkable
if
you
like
it
i
definitely
could
go
for
a
couple
more
of
these
at
the
moment
drinkability
depends
on
how
much
of
a
weirdo
you
are
with
a
suitable
pairing
for
the
sourness
maybe
a
dessert
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
these
but
theres
only
so
much
brettanomyces
that
one
human
being
can
take
it
seems
to
stand
up
pretty
well
to
spicy
food
as
well
d
it
is
kind
of
weird
not
to
fond
of
it
to
much
carbonation
the
only
thing
that
i
really
like
about
it
is
the
aroma
for
me
this
is
truly
the
burgundy
of
beers
wild
gamey
dry
tannic
fleshy
this
isnt
the
biggest
baddest
boldest
or
even
most
extreme
beer
but
it
satisfies
in
some
of
the
same
ways
as
those
kinds
of
beers
yet
it
also
works
well
with
various
foods
and
for
quiet
contemplative
sipping
sessions
a
textbookdefinition
acquired
taste
beer
this
is
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
taste
and
drinkability
is
way
up
there
bc
of
the
bonedry
finish
its
thin
but
i
guess
its
accurate
for
the
style
awesome
d
drinkability
is
decent
to
me
this
is
a
beer
that
is
crying
out
for
more
hops
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
pleasant
enough
but
its
just
missing
something
taste
of
bretta
and
a
slightly
sharp
acidity
which
is
a
bit
too
sharp
for
me
and
it
also
has
a
medicinal
taste
the
typical
orval
yeast
is
a
strange
animal
that
seems
to
be
behave
differently
every
time
and
over
time
the
hops
quickly
overrule
the
sharp
taste
and
give
the
beer
a
nice
dryhoppy
taste
that
is
resinous
and
spicy
body
is
quite
thin
but
in
style
just
a
great
beer
loved
it
and
will
go
back
for
more
d
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
cases
of
this
i
would
have
trouble
rationing
just
a
few
bottles
what
a
great
drinkable
beer
my
fav
of
all
time
very
distinct
from
other
beers
this
in
my
opinion
is
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
poured
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
very
nice
head
at
first
had
a
light
flavor
with
a
taste
of
a
slight
banana
yeast
flavor
it
had
a
moderate
finish
that
hung
around
in
my
mouth
for
about
20
seconds
the
mouthfel
was
good
and
had
a
decent
carbonation
that
seemed
to
fit
the
beer
looks
great
in
short
golden
in
color
seems
to
glow
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
dense
and
creamy
with
bubbles
too
small
to
see
in
places
smell
is
sweet
but
with
a
bitter
note
in
the
background
and
something
like
cloves
tastes
peppery
at
first
but
that
quickly
mellows
to
reveal
the
malt
that
in
turn
yields
to
the
dry
slightly
acidic
finish
that
is
a
very
crisp
refreshing
combination
indeed
i
suspect
that
aging
would
only
benefit
this
one
though
ive
never
tried
it
mouthfeel
is
very
good
silky
and
oily
which
makes
a
nice
contrast
to
the
crisp
flavor
finish
drinkability
is
good
but
the
dryness
of
the
aftertaste
usually
means
i
only
have
one
of
these
in
a
session
i
havent
had
another
beer
like
this
its
really
a
great
unique
experience
pair
it
with
as
you
can
at
the
cafe
nearby
a
ham
potato
and
cheese
stew
cooked
in
the
beer
and
youve
really
got
something
drinkability
is
good
nice
and
light
enjoyable
cheers
original
belgina
ipa
another
one
of
my
first
belgian
beers
still
fantastic
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
it
probably
needs
another
chance
ill
try
this
again
at
a
later
date
the
bottle
i
got
was
bottled
on
13106
and
i
drank
it
on
122706
so
it
was
about
11
months
old
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
chimay
glass
and
it
fit
perfectly
the
beer
was
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
and
the
near
white
creamy
head
filled
the
rest
of
the
glass
as
with
most
belgians
the
head
stuck
around
for
a
while
and
slowly
fell
unevenly
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sour
smelling
which
matches
the
taste
there
isnt
enough
sweetness
to
entirely
balance
the
sour
as
in
some
other
beers
ive
tried
but
the
sour
flavor
isnt
bad
either
it
is
fairly
smooth
for
the
sourness
overall
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
but
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
if
it
was
aged
more
notes
it
may
be
good
for
some
if
so
go
for
it
but
for
me
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
no
no
the
head
was
equally
as
huge
as
my
first
review
but
this
time
it
left
tons
of
lace
along
with
the
phenol
and
grasshop
smell
i
also
pick
up
some
lemon
and
tart
apple
the
taste
is
quite
earthy
and
has
a
funky
sourness
to
it
apples
and
lemon
are
predominiate
with
some
medicinal
flavors
as
well
the
carbonation
seems
smoother
on
this
sample
definitely
a
different
belgian
brew
which
seems
to
change
with
age
first
of
all
what
a
classy
looking
bottle
this
came
in
this
beer
was
produced
on
6302005
it
poured
a
cloudy
light
browntan
color
with
a
decent
head
and
some
lacing
even
though
i
poured
carefully
yeast
was
noticeable
floating
in
large
clumps
the
smell
was
floral
and
slightly
spicy
very
inviting
where
this
beer
took
a
downturn
was
the
taste
it
was
bitter
and
floral
almost
tasted
like
drinking
potpourri
the
mouth
feel
was
thin
and
left
a
bitter
coat
on
the
tongue
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
worth
a
try
as
it
might
appeal
to
some
taste
buds
havent
had
this
in
a
few
years
it
wont
be
another
few
years
before
i
have
another
one
this
is
a
nice
transition
beer
for
newer
beer
drinkers
either
to
ipas
wild
ales
or
other
belgians
i
recommend
trying
this
to
anyone
havent
had
too
many
beers
quite
like
this
to
me
its
like
a
toned
down
jp
oro
de
calabaza
which
is
a
good
thing
poured
out
a
nice
amber
with
a
good
thick
fluffy
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
as
the
beer
went
done
smelled
floral
sweet
with
a
handful
of
straw
thrown
in
a
sharp
carbonation
on
the
tongue
that
mellowed
out
a
bit
as
the
beer
warmed
up
there
was
some
bitterness
and
some
hop
characteristics
but
a
typical
sweetness
to
it
a
little
sharp
in
the
mouth
but
otherwise
easy
to
drink
served
from
a
bottle
62711
exp
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
nice
dark
golden
color
with
apples
on
the
nose
poured
gently
and
created
a
huge
off
white
head
at
first
it
tastes
very
fruity
with
distinct
colors
of
apples
cider
and
other
fuits
as
well
as
a
twinge
of
cinnamon
a
very
interesting
after
taste
lingered
after
the
first
sip
the
head
eventually
dissolved
into
a
1
finger
constant
with
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
just
carbonated
enough
and
not
too
overly
done
mouthfeel
was
great
the
beer
just
rolled
around
and
did
not
want
to
go
down
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
just
hope
the
store
i
go
to
keeps
carrying
it
poured
from
bottle
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
wowee
zowee
this
has
a
damn
fine
head
it
looks
like
i
just
made
a
root
beer
float
and
it
retains
damn
well
too
rocky
and
fluffy
almost
cloud
like
and
the
lacing
is
nice
too
the
head
just
doesnt
completely
go
away
amberish
opaque
color
smell
of
light
alcohol
and
apples
and
various
spices
and
a
mild
hop
aroma
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
champagne
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
subtle
i
still
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
exactly
i
should
compare
it
to
appleraspberryboysenberrypear
the
hops
are
nice
and
dont
dominate
but
they
stick
with
you
to
the
bitter
end
sorry
for
the
pun
anyways
this
beer
is
light
bodied
with
very
subtle
carbonation
very
nice
love
it
and
would
drink
it
again
many
a
time
a
very
unique
beer
which
i
found
enormously
likable
could
easily
have
more
than
one
or
two
drinkability
tart
with
nice
dominant
brett
character
there
was
just
something
eminently
onedimensional
about
this
beer
i
could
only
taste
that
one
thing
and
it
wasnt
a
fresh
spiciness
or
complex
malt
character
or
anything
like
that
it
was
just
well
boring
and
almost
incomparable
to
anything
else
first
and
possibly
last
tasting
for
this
beer
strong
burst
of
carbonation
on
opening
bottle
first
pour
gushes
and
foams
i
wait
and
pour
the
rest
in
one
smooth
motion
dense
rocky
offwhite
creamy
head
looks
too
beautiful
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
just
look
at
it
light
mahogany
color
with
orange
highlights
aroma
of
sherbert
and
damp
earth
near
the
stables
phenolic
aromas
and
flavors
of
holiday
spices
and
juicy
fruit
gum
not
very
sweet
though
with
a
little
sour
tang
15
minutes
later
and
halfway
through
the
beer
the
head
has
finally
settled
down
to
a
thin
soft
blanket
of
melted
marshmallow
with
persistent
lacing
i
used
to
not
like
this
beer
but
perhaps
my
pallette
has
matured
beyond
hasty
expectations
of
big
overly
candylike
dark
fruity
tasting
belgian
strong
ales
i
am
humbled
and
exalted
at
the
same
time
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
eat
something
savory
and
earthy
yet
not
heavy
or
too
rich
a
fairly
complex
and
interesting
beer
it
have
always
enjoyed
orval
and
would
never
turn
one
down
i
originally
had
this
during
a
tasting
this
summer
at
that
time
i
was
not
quite
wowed
in
comparison
to
other
trappists
but
recently
i
thought
it
needed
a
try
all
on
its
own
here
goes
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
rather
haphazardly
a
huge
foamy
head
like
the
top
of
mount
everest
or
something
with
thick
sticky
white
snow
lacing
all
over
the
retention
is
wonderful
smells
of
pilsner
malt
lots
of
nice
citrus
hints
of
apple
light
spice
and
saaz
hops
maybe
first
beer
i
think
of
in
relation
is
duvel
at
least
in
the
nose
taste
how
ever
is
little
like
that
belgian
devil
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
bitterness
is
minimal
on
this
same
with
sweetness
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
sweetness
toward
the
middle
and
finish
which
this
one
does
not
really
have
i
think
thus
it
lends
its
self
to
consumption
in
mass
quantities
or
at
least
more
than
one
i
feel
like
i
can
really
taste
the
quality
of
the
water
in
this
more
so
than
other
trappists
something
about
its
subtleness
allows
that
element
to
shine
through
i
also
heard
that
orval
makes
some
tasty
cheese
which
i
will
have
to
purchase
along
with
another
of
these
all
and
all
this
is
my
least
favorite
trappist
ale
for
just
drinking
but
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
with
the
right
food
it
might
do
better
than
its
other
family
members
d
could
keep
it
up
all
night
however
would
prefer
to
drink
a
different
beer
now
check
out
orvals
website
while
youre
at
it
its
really
cool
a
beer
that
to
me
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
think
it
would
have
been
even
better
had
it
aged
a
little
because
this
bottle
was
a
little
on
the
green
side
a
must
for
any
belgian
fan
or
somebody
looking
to
get
in
to
belgian
beer
d
this
one
is
very
tasty
and
goes
down
ridiculously
easy
with
no
hint
of
alcohol
i
could
certainly
stay
with
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
drinkabilitynotes
simply
superb
one
of
the
best
of
the
trappistbrewed
beers
remarkable
in
its
excellence
a
classic
and
the
definitive
belgian
pale
ale
thank
you
orval
i
liked
the
subdued
but
noticable
taste
of
strong
german
hops
i
would
rate
this
as
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
would
like
a
bit
more
substance
in
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
of
this
beer
definitely
shines
above
50deg
overall
i
rank
it
second
among
the
ales
of
the
trappiste
bieres
an
interesting
distinctive
ale
that
manages
to
be
both
incredibly
complex
and
impressively
balanced
so
i
finally
decided
to
try
this
one
after
hearing
the
name
occasionally
enough
to
be
interested
i
found
the
appearance
to
be
pretty
nice
especially
due
to
the
beautiful
white
head
the
amber
color
was
nice
but
standard
so
the
head
really
did
the
job
of
making
it
a
beautiful
sight
the
aroma
was
great
as
well
very
fruity
and
sweet
i
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
banana
and
maybe
some
brown
sugar
plum
notes
however
the
taste
was
way
different
consisting
of
some
light
malts
overly
intensive
vegetable
like
hops
and
the
occasional
addition
from
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
overly
bitter
for
my
taste
but
the
consistency
was
nice
and
thinsmooth
i
am
not
interested
in
trying
this
beer
again
considering
i
expected
much
more
and
am
fairly
disappointed
overall
an
amazing
beer
prhaps
my
favorite
trappist
ive
had
atleast
over
chimay
and
archel
this
beer
pours
a
nice
orange
autumninspired
color
with
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
recedes
into
purdy
lacing
truth
be
told
theres
still
some
head
in
the
glass
and
im
halfway
through
this
sucker
the
smell
is
niiice
reminding
me
of
a
rose
garden
apples
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
citrus
lemon
maybe
the
flavor
is
complex
as
well
with
subtle
tastes
of
apple
flowers
and
a
bit
of
spice
among
other
things
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
slightly
snappy
very
drinkable
with
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
having
at
least
a
couple
at
a
time
being
the
price
well
done
overall
a
unique
brew
but
not
my
favorite
belgian
ale
and
at
67
per
bottle
in
the
store
and
10
at
the
restaurant
it
is
quite
pricey
i
wont
buy
this
again
ddrinkable
yes
but
as
i
mentioned
its
not
for
me
id
never
turn
one
away
but
id
probably
try
something
different
if
i
had
the
choice
nose
is
sweet
oranges
citrus
bready
and
maybe
even
a
little
sour
the
taste
starts
off
tart
and
a
little
sour
then
almost
turns
into
a
hoppy
pale
ale
the
beer
foams
in
the
mouth
highly
carbonated
and
finished
dry
light
and
refreshing
even
with
the
massive
carbonation
the
final
pour
with
sediment
disappointing
leave
it
behind
i
gave
it
a
low
drinkabilty
mark
because
i
dont
like
tart
beers
other
wise
a
fairly
sound
choice
this
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
my
favorite
belgian
style
its
a
wonderful
sipping
brew
that
i
enjoy
as
an
occassional
treat
a
true
world
classic
if
it
had
been
a
blind
tasting
i
would
have
said
it
was
a
rough
cider
or
a
really
poor
geuze
hopefully
after
i
have
tried
more
begian
pales
i
can
make
my
way
back
to
this
one
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
and
head
retained
until
the
last
swig
but
that
may
be
due
to
drinking
it
quicker
than
usual
but
i
couldnt
help
it
delicious
cant
wait
to
have
another
perhaps
an
austere
hardliner
among
the
trappists
this
beer
is
nonetheless
one
of
the
greats
drinkability
isnt
all
that
great
here
because
of
the
perfume
feel
in
the
aftertaste
d
i
think
it
would
become
pretty
neutral
after
two
or
three
in
succession
overall
though
it
is
not
bad
ive
heard
people
rave
and
ive
heard
them
trash
this
beer
for
me
well
the
first
sip
was
an
eyeopener
and
then
i
slid
into
a
very
cozy
comfort
zone
with
it
its
sharp
and
fresh
and
certainly
drinkable
if
you
like
it
that
is
and
i
like
it
and
will
again
when
the
mood
strikes
which
could
be
virtually
any
moment
now
this
time
around
quite
enjoyable
i
like
it
as
a
summer
warm
fall
day
beer
adventurous
wide
ranging
and
truly
a
belgian
treat
enjoy
in
short
it
simply
tastes
orval
i
will
be
haveing
more
of
these
murky
orange
body
with
5
or
6
fingers
of
head
typical
of
an
abbey
or
trappist
ale
tons
of
lacing
too
smells
sweet
citrussy
and
yeasty
rather
complex
flavor
tastes
citrusy
spicy
piney
slightly
sour
but
in
a
good
way
somewhat
peppery
and
alcolic
as
well
i
like
this
beer
it
definitely
worth
the
hype
had
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
more
hops
than
i
expected
finished
with
a
dryness
a
complex
beer
overall
d
im
wondering
if
i
got
a
light
struck
bottle
the
aroma
is
wonderful
but
the
flavor
is
just
not
i
was
hoping
for
ill
rereview
this
beer
later
when
i
pick
up
another
bottle
the
place
by
my
house
sells
these
11
2oz
bottles
for
4
6142013
upped
some
scores
after
purchasing
an
amsterdambelgium
ticket
and
cracking
a
bottle
from
lost
dog
doverall
a
good
drinkable
beer
great
for
a
summer
afternoon
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
trappists
this
is
one
amazing
unique
and
uncompromising
monster
of
a
trappist
ale
a
world
class
offering
and
strongly
recommended
note
this
is
one
fine
ale
loved
it
from
start
to
finish
just
too
bad
its
so
high
priced
and
very
hard
to
find
in
my
area
opened
our
fifth
and
final
bottle
in
september
2010
like
every
one
of
them
bottled
12406
and
good
until
12411
although
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
holding
up
too
well
very
foamy
on
the
pour
with
a
consistent
fluffy
white
head
color
looks
darker
and
cloudier
this
year
smells
like
apple
cider
vinegar
tastes
a
little
flat
like
cardboard
or
wood
its
like
a
very
weak
wine
mouthfeel
is
still
fizzy
and
bright
this
beer
has
about
three
months
left
in
its
life
but
already
it
seems
to
be
turning
into
nothing
only
some
hints
of
belgium
yeast
and
orange
topped
by
sweet
malts
but
the
taste

wow
just
not
there
a
stringent
and
soapy
blend
of
two
not
pleasant
tastes
dry
and
crisp
yeah
but
the
drinkability
was
off
the
chart
at
a
freakin
5
a
11
2
oz
bottle
d
i
may
have
rated
the
drinkability
5
higher
than
i
should
simply
due
to
the
sheer
fact
its
orval
trappist
in
order
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
would
have
to
take
a
halfhour
belching
break
in
between
the
bloating
effect
is
so
high
maybe
the
poor
quality
has
something
to
do
in
the
way
the
shop
handled
this
particular
shipmentbut
lightning
has
stuck
twice
orval
trappist
ale
was
amber
in
color
with
a
large
white
bubbly
head
the
head
had
decent
retention
and
left
plenty
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
full
of
trappist
yeast
with
a
little
malt
and
slight
alcohol
smell
the
taste
was
fruity
mostly
citrus
and
lightly
spicy
the
body
was
medium
to
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
nice
drinkabilily
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
will
purchase
again
md
effervescent
texture
with
a
mouthful
of
creamy
fizziness
mediumbodied
and
lots
of
flavours
to
discern
with
patience
absolutely
nice
not
delicious
but
very
complex
and
worth
ones
34
hour
for
slow
sipping
compared
with
my
previous
note
this
bottle
shows
more
bitterness
and
is
not
as
fruity
as
the
last
bottle
will
review
another
bottle
from
the
same
batch
in
another
six
months
overall
im
somewhat
dissapointed
with
this
brew
although
i
was
expecting
a
lot
after
having
the
other
trappist
ales
this
stuff
definitely
falls
short
of
the
other
five
trappists
but
overall
it
is
still
quite
a
good
brew
recommended
at
least
it
poured
a
lovely
deep
reddishcherry
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
smell
was
sweet
and
spicy
the
taste
so
much
better
than
how
id
remembered
it
this
was
a
damn
fine
beer
sweet
up
front
but
balanced
out
with
a
certain
spicyness
that
balances
things
out
nicely
a
nice
beer
poured
into
my
lovely
orval
challis
it
has
a
deep
orange
and
light
reddishbrown
color
to
it
the
head
is
outstanding
it
looks
so
creamy
the
head
almost
reminds
me
of
soft
peak
egg
whites
kind
of
like
meringue
i
smell
a
lot
of
citrus
and
it
also
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
lambic
tastes
of
toffee
and
fresh
bread
at
first
then
quickly
moves
to
the
citrus
spicy
bitterness
of
the
hops
which
lingers
on
the
tounge
a
while
after
taking
a
drink
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
lemon
meringue
pie
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
and
think
people
should
drink
more
of
it
edit
the
more
of
this
beer
i
have
the
more
i
love
it
this
last
time
i
paired
it
with
the
orval
trappist
cheese
and
it
was
a
magnificient
combination
drinkability
i
dont
like
this
much
so
its
not
sessionable
i
hadnt
had
this
beer
in
years
and
completely
forgot
what
it
tasted
like
i
really
dig
the
flavor
dispite
its
young
age
it
shows
its
greatness
underneath
worth
cellaring
a
few
bottles
cheers
drinkability
my
least
favorite
of
the
trappists
i
have
tried
will
not
buy
again
d
this
is
a
great
belgian
ale
i
love
the
sour
kick
with
is
traditional
belgian
ale
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
is
nicely
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
is
full
of
body
a
little
sticky
clean
with
a
little
dryness
in
the
finish
this
was
an
amazing
surprise
and
a
real
treat
for
me
the
abv
being
what
it
is
its
exceedingly
drinkable
but
the
actual
quality
of
the
beer
makes
you
want
to
save
these
for
a
special
occasion
also
id
like
to
come
back
to
it
in
a
year
or
so
see
whats
changed
if
you
live
in
a
place
where
this
stuff
is
readily
available
im
so
jealous
i
wonder
how
this
would
taste
closer
to
the
expiration
date
i
bought
this
bottle
in
the
summer
of
04
along
with
another
and
drank
one
immediately
i
thought
the
beer
at
the
time
too
strong
so
i
cellared
this
one
until
now
it
is
a
wonderful
drinker
and
im
glad
i
waited
after
further
experimentation
with
belgian
brews
this
poured
a
copper
orange
head
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
it
smelled
very
tart
with
malty
sweetness
present
ripe
fruit
spices
and
slight
hint
of
lemon
it
tasted
smooth
and
crisp
well
balanced
with
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
the
hops
gave
it
a
slight
bite
which
was
nice
it
had
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
that
made
it
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
was
a
very
good
tasting
complex
ale
that
i
would
reccomend
to
anybody
really
certainly
a
nice
looking
beer
poured
into
its
matching
glass
very
little
head
unlike
some
of
the
other
reviews
bottled
4106
nice
hop
character
and
lasting
finish
citrusy
somewhat
thin
body
extremely
drinkable
i
will
let
the
rest
of
mine
sit
a
while
longer
and
try
it
then
drinkabilityoverall
certainly
the
most
unique
of
the
trappists
we
sampled
with
the
gueuze
funk
and
pucker
and
odd
herbal
notes
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
trappist
but
glad
i
tried
it
though
its
certainly
a
oneanddone
for
me
a
great
brew
glad
i
finally
tried
it
this
is
an
excellent
beer
overall
this
is
a
terrific
brew
its
better
slightly
warm
if
you
order
it
have
the
patience
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
i
prefer
around
55
overall
impression
part
of
my
continuing
quest
to
sample
all
the
classic
commercial
examples
this
one
was
interesting
well
crafted
and
worthy
of
its
reputation
however
with
the
price
tag
it
wont
be
in
the
regular
rotation
a
nice
belgian
specialty
ale
that
was
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
for
me
overall
i
would
recommend
this
beer
very
interesting
notes
tons
of
carbination
and
a
very
nice
introduction
into
the
world
of
beglum
pale
ales
at
first
the
taste
is
sweet
but
that
doesnt
last
long
at
all
a
nice
bittery
hoppy
flavor
that
quickly
gets
replaced
by
acidity
that
must
be
the
result
of
the
yeasties
or
mebbe
bretts
this
ones
also
pretty
carbonated
the
first
bottle
i
opened
foamed
big
time
i
liked
the
carbonation
on
it
and
found
that
it
imrpoved
the
drinkability
to
a
certain
extent
i
did
not
find
this
to
be
a
very
big
alcohol
bomb
although
that
may
be
because
we
spent
the
whole
weekend
trying
different
belgian
style
ales
so
we
may
have
been
used
to
it
all
in
all
a
pretty
nice
ale
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
while
its
not
going
to
knock
off
othe
belgians
that
i
prefer
this
was
a
nice
change
from
the
norm
drinkable
but
sometimes
comes
off
as
too
savoury
and
can
be
a
bit
harsh
on
the
tongue
d
in
a
blind
taste
test
this
beer
could
pass
for
a
saison
easy
this
beer
is
a
trip
a
unique
intriguing
complex
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
d
very
drinkable
smoother
than
some
of
the
stronger
belgian
ales
which
can
really
be
viewed
as
a
plus
or
a
minus
i
felt
it
complemented
the
taste
goes
down
lightly
dry
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
overall
definitely
an
unusual
brew
and
one
that
not
everyone
will
enjoy
however
its
well
put
together
and
definitely
worth
a
try
this
trappist
ale
would
be
superb
with
broiled
or
bbqd
pork
chops
and
a
little
apple
sauce
on
the
side
while
i
have
been
rating
beers
for
only
a
short
time
i
have
been
drinking
beers
of
all
kinds
for
35
years
the
taste
and
finish
was
so
good
that
i
refrained
from
drinking
or
eating
for
a
long
while
after
to
make
it
last
i
plan
to
try
another
orval
some
time
soon
to
make
sure
i
am
consistent
in
my
opinion
but
as
of
right
now
i
have
to
say
that
orval
is
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
d
defnitely
the
most
unique
of
the
trappist
beers
that
ive
had
to
date
and
my
favorite
i
think
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
rough
on
the
palate
but
otherwise
this
is
a
fine
brew
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
and
always
enjoy
it
flavor
is
a
bit
different
from
other
trappists
but
mouthfeel
definately
can
be
a
little
distracting
still
it
is
a
trappist
ale
with
a
very
nice
flavor
and
aroma
crux
unique
and
fascinating
belgian
brew
here
each
bottle
is
an
aesthetic
experience
well
worth
the
sample
i
can
remember
having
better
bottles
of
this
brew
in
the
past
so
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
encounter
with
this
brew
already
very
dry
refreshing
beer
bottled
in
22005
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
magnificant
looking
head
that
leaves
beautiful
lacing
the
aroma
is
floral
sour
and
bit
spicey
taste
is
dry
and
crisp
that
is
highly
carbonated
spicey
grassy
and
tart
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
dryest
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
while
it
is
a
good
beer
i
admit
that
it
is
just
not
my
thing
it
was
just
a
little
too
dry
for
me
and
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
the
earthygrassy
taste
this
is
a
good
treat
but
definitely
not
a
session
beer
very
dry
and
fairly
high
abv
overall
id
recommend
it
but
not
more
than
one
or
two
a
night
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
many
belgians
are
too
sweet
for
me
but
this
one
was
dry
had
a
real
hop
presence
and
was
overall
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
with
a
thick
thick
head
the
head
stayed
with
the
beer
throughout
leaving
thick
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
and
chunks
of
foam
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
taste
was
good
but
less
than
remarkable
slightly
weaker
than
most
trappists
that
ive
had
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
my
only
problem
with
it
was
the
cost
i
paid
5
50
for
a
12
oz
bottle
orval
is
certainly
a
unique
beer
surprising
in
its
flavor
profile
and
rewarding
in
its
rapid
evolution
i
do
suspect
this
is
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
more
and
more
this
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
with
what
seems
like
winter
spicescoriandercinamon
and
also
floral
scents
lemon
and
pepper
the
taste
has
a
almost
sour
spicy
flavor
coriander
pepper
lemon
and
malt
are
all
present
in
this
beer
the
mf
is
light
and
all
the
numerous
flavors
mix
very
well
a
damn
good
beer
that
shouldnt
be
missed
this
is
a
complex
belgian
for
sure
full
of
all
kinds
of
unique
floral
and
perfume
tones
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
two
years
old
seems
to
be
a
fine
time
to
be
drinking
this
good
stuff
taste
is
dry
light
and
complex
initial
fruit
becomes
extremely
dry
giving
way
to
dirty
barnyard
flavors
some
lemon
fruit
returns
intermittently
some
hops
are
noted
in
the
dry
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
while
it
lasts
sterile
slightly
bitter
finish
plenty
drinkable
i
must
cellar
some
of
these
for
several
years
awesome
belgian
i
see
why
this
brewery
only
makes
two
beers
i
imagine
the
petite
orval
is
great
as
well
will
need
to
have
d
ive
had
this
once
before
and
wasnt
overly
impressed
having
tried
it
again
my
opinion
has
changed
very
good
beer
interesting
i
wont
wait
8
years
between
bottles
ss
all
in
all
a
decent
belgian
but
for
a
trappist
beer
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
ya
know
i
never
liked
orval
until
this
moment
fairly
fresh
bottle
for
american
standards
only
about
6
months
young
attractive
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
monstrous
white
head
that
falls
eloquently
expressive
yeasty
and
hoppy
nose
with
hints
of
flowers
perfume
and
citrus
fruits
flavor
is
extremely
complex
bursting
with
citrus
fruits
exploding
with
hop
flavor
while
remaining
very
funky
somewhat
sour
full
of
horseblanket
and
wild
yeast
flavors
dry
lingering
incredible
and
oh
so
unique
palate
is
smooth
and
bubbly
and
so
fitting
drinkability
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
bite
and
lower
abv
poured
a
beautiful
yellow
gold
with
an
inchtall
head
in
my
tulip
goblet
the
head
remained
a
quarter
of
an
inch
tall
throughout
the
entire
session
even
at
the
end
of
the
glass
tiny
bubbles
continued
to
rise
the
beer
smelled
of
fine
grass
lemon
and
hay
the
beer
had
an
earthy
spiciness
to
it
and
almost
tasted
sweaty
horseblanket
i
dont
know
ive
never
smelled
one
there
was
a
perfect
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
caradmon
black
pepper
and
grapfruit
i
attempted
to
pair
this
with
a
simple
grilled
salmon
and
roasted
veggies
asparagus
mushrooms
and
zuccini
marinated
in
a
dressing
made
from
penzeys
french
country
vinagrette
spice
blend
the
meal
and
beer
did
not
contrast
or
compliment
each
other
and
were
therefore
a
push
thus
i
pulled
out
the
gruyere
cheese
this
cheese
was
a
little
old
and
losing
its
nutty
and
toasty
qualities
but
the
beer
worked
wonders
on
it
again
it
was
not
the
perfect
match
but
the
hard
gruyere
actually
tasted
creamy
after
sipping
the
beer
the
fading
nuttiness
came
forth
despite
the
lack
of
nuttiness
in
the
beer
and
the
cheese
helped
flesh
out
some
of
the
spicy
earthy
sweaty
corners
of
the
brew
i
would
definitely
not
try
this
beer
again
unless
i
had
a
good
goat
cheese
gouda
or
aged
cheddar
to
go
with
it
this
brew
has
an
very
active
carbonation
while
wielding
a
light
to
moderate
mouthfeel
almost
arid
in
its
finish
the
flavor
is
citric
and
bitter
with
a
lemon
rind
tone
throughout
the
drink
i
like
it
notes
aroma
is
very
unique
that
brettanomyces
really
gives
it
a
complexity
not
as
sour
as
it
smelled
like
it
would
be
very
interesting
and
good
overall
a
belgian
classic
alcohol
not
really
noticable
and
seems
quite
light
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
a
nice
light
salad
good
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
light
maybe
watery
overall
if
you
like
belgian
beers
particularly
the
trappists
this
is
a
must
try
it
is
however
definitely
not
a
beer
that
everyone
will
enjoy
i
did
but
im
not
going
to
rush
out
and
buy
more
final
thoughts
forgettable
i
hate
to
say
it
after
all
that
worry
about
what
i
would
finally
think
but
i
really
dont
think
anything
its
okay
but
not
exceptional
drinkability
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
obviously
no
session
beer
drink
late
and
drink
slowly
it
is
exceptionally
savorable
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
into
a
tulip
glass
the
head
lasted
for
quite
a
bit
of
time
the
smell
i
got
from
this
one
is
a
bit
of
malts
and
some
earthy
notes
interesting
but
not
overly
complex
the
taste
is
a
bit
sour
but
also
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bit
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
with
the
sour
and
the
bitter
and
some
sweet
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
orval
and
will
enjoy
a
few
more
in
the
near
future
the
sourdry
finish
is
reminiscent
of
a
dry
red
wine
like
a
cheap
merlot
sideways
comes
to
mind
hops
are
definitely
present
and
yeast
to
be
sure
but
wheres
the
malts
its
there
just
under
the
sour
layer
of
yeast
and
astringent
hops
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
as
you
sip
it
and
the
fruitiness
from
the
yeasts
becomes
more
noticeable
to
me
but
over
all
just
doesnt
agree
with
me
very
well
and
i
like
saisons
at
least
the
few
ive
had
good
mouthfeel
light
but
not
terribly
drinkable
for
the
style
imo
one
is
enough
thanks
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
cleansing
with
a
medium
body
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
distinctive
beer
that
is
nicely
refreshing
but
as
much
as
i
like
this
beer
im
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
not
really
a
session
beer
the
thing
that
i
like
about
this
beer
its
complexity
also
makes
it
slightly
less
drinkable
not
sure
if
that
makes
sense
i
also
think
a
food
match
would
be
challenging
a
few
cheeses
came
to
mind
but
not
much
else
anyway
a
wonderfully
unique
beer
poured
with
a
huge
dense
tan
head
that
slowly
faded
to
an
island
of
foam
in
the
middle
of
the
chalice
nose
is
earthy
grassy
really
quite
hard
to
describe
but
i
didnt
find
any
off
putting
aromas
in
the
smell
color
is
a
murky
amber
not
unlike
a
darker
hefeweizen
taste
starts
with
a
slightly
sour
note
but
then
turns
into
a
hoppy
dry
finish
there
are
other
belgians
i
prefer
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
a
bit
expensive
at
6
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
because
of
the
price
i
would
probably
not
buy
it
very
often
if
at
all
once
upon
a
time
i
was
not
a
fan
of
orval
but
as
my
taste
buds
and
olfactory
glands
have
grown
to
appreciate
and
even
crave
sourness
in
beer
they
have
also
learned
to
love
this
fine
trappist
for
me
the
aroma
of
orval
is
perfect
it
is
very
difficult
to
describe
the
aroma
contains
a
wonderful
sourness
that
is
surprisingly
not
present
in
the
taste
within
that
sourness
are
hop
oils
phenols
a
perfumed
fruitiness
and
bitterness
quinine
lemon
grass
hay
and
so
much
more
that
i
cant
place
a
finger
on
orvals
body
is
light
and
about
as
dry
as
it
gets
it
is
well
hopped
slightly
bitter
and
tastes
of
medicinal
light
fruits
and
leather
i
prefer
most
of
the
other
trappist
beers
to
orval
simply
because
i
prefer
quads
dubbels
and
bsdas
to
pales
however
i
believe
that
this
is
the
quintessential
example
for
the
style
its
certainly
the
best
ive
had
after
hearing
nothing
but
raves
about
the
orval
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
i
heard
so
many
suggest
ways
to
drink
i
e
50
degrees
in
a
glass
to
bring
out
the
flavors
and
many
others
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
was
extremely
unimpressed
for
the
hype
the
head
looked
almost
like
that
froth
that
churns
up
on
the
sea
shore
and
just
stuck
to
the
glass
taste
was
not
overly
great
either
for
5
a
beer
i
would
say
spend
a
couple
extra
bucks
and
get
a
decent
6
pack
you
will
be
much
happier
overall
a
little
disappointing
probably
my
least
favorite
belgian
pale
to
date
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
to
copper
color
and
makes
a
pale
tan
crown
that
fades
into
an
island
of
cloudy
bubbles
and
a
thin
halo
satiny
lace
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
orval
goblet
aroma
has
a
sour
twang
earthy
barnyard
funk
horsey
very
unusual
flavor
earthy
hop
bitterness
peppery
spice
and
bread
yeast
nearly
no
sweetness
funky
lemonlike
sour
notes
from
the
brettanomyces
has
many
saison
qualities
light
to
medium
bodied
crisp
intense
carbonation
super
clean
dry
finish
these
monks
make
a
tasty
beverage
will
definitely
drink
again
the
famous
orval
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
605
and
a
best
by
date
of
610
pours
a
slighly
hazy
medium
amber
with
a
good
2
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
ok
lace
earthy
and
grassy
citrus
smells
with
slight
caramel
and
raisin
very
earthy
and
grassy
taste
mixed
with
a
decent
amount
of
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
although
its
an
odd
flavor
not
off
but
odd
it
is
different
from
the
other
trappist
ales
i
have
tried
it
seems
a
bit
harsh
i
have
one
more
bottle
tucked
away
that
i
will
have
to
try
in
a
year
or
two
its
not
a
bad
flavored
beer
i
just
think
this
bottle
is
still
too
young
d
i
dont
think
i
could
have
too
many
of
these
for
me
this
is
something
to
be
savoured
once
in
a
while
and
not
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
i
have
come
to
enjoy
saisons
and
other
similar
styles
over
the
last
few
years
so
i
figured
id
give
it
another
shot
im
glad
i
did
this
was
good
but
for
the
price
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
other
abbeys
i
would
have
liked
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
a
little
more
malt
my
girl
friend
thought
this
ale
was
fantastic
i
gave
her
the
rest
of
mine
pours
a
dark
amber
with
chunky
foamy
lucious
looking
head
aromas
similiar
to
a
heffe
with
some
banana
and
clove
alcohol
astringent
on
the
tongue
has
almost
a
soapy
flavor
alcohol
also
makes
a
strong
presence
in
flavor
surprising
for
a
lower
abv
trappist
its
good
to
try
another
trappist
but
i
have
to
say
this
beer
isnt
doing
much
for
me
much
rather
drink
a
nb
trippel
or
heffe
initial
tastes
are
surprising
and
really
hard
to
identify
as
i
keep
drinking
and
it
warms
i
really
get
into
this
beer
but
i
still
cant
identify
specific
flavours
sourish
fruitlike
wild
barnyard
definitely
some
aromas
i
remember
from
living
on
or
near
farms
as
a
kid
an
incredibily
unique
flavour
perfect
mouthfeel
and
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
make
this
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
even
at
its
abv
level
looking
forward
to
keeping
a
decent
stock
of
this
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
here
cheers2beers
overall
not
my
favorite
dubbel
but
a
good
selection
the
appearance
was
bad
but
i
did
not
have
a
good
glass
at
the
time
the
color
is
a
lite
amberorangish
brown
and
the
head
was
very
high
and
dissipated
to
a
nice
lacing
shortly
the
smell
is
flowery
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
citrus
fumes
of
alcohol
can
be
noticed
as
well
tastes
of
lemon
spices
alcohol
a
little
malty
lacking
in
taste
mouth
feel
is
descent
and
the
carbonation
is
very
good
drinkablitly
is
alright
this
beer
would
be
easy
to
drink
because
of
no
real
flavors
presented
either
good
nor
bad
not
one
of
my
favorite
trappists
thats
for
sure
after
not
having
one
of
these
since
ive
become
a
better
beer
taster
i
figured
it
was
worth
another
shot
i
am
more
impressed
now
than
i
was
before
of
course
ive
become
a
big
belgian
sour
beer
fan
in
the
meantime
pours
a
prune
juice
color
with
a
rocky
foamstand
that
varies
between
eggshell
white
and
ambertan
sprinkled
with
spices
aromatics
of
sourness
tartness
muskiness
woodsy
metalic
and
oysters
flavors
boarder
closely
on
the
characters
in
the
aroma
low
levels
of
barley
maybe
too
low
lends
an
overly
sour
flavor
and
astringency
not
enough
sweetness
remains
to
balance
out
the
tartness
some
dms
qualities
come
through
that
reminds
me
of
an
ocean
muskiness
or
oyster
flavor
fascinating
but
very
raw
the
beer
is
well
matured
and
complex
i
enjoyed
it
although
there
are
characteristics
within
that
i
did
not
prefer
adam
i
remember
i
have
never
loved
this
beer
but
at
3
years
old
this
is
a
very
presentable
beer
and
an
enjoyable
bottle
on
its
own
merits
d
if
it
is
always
like
this
then
it
needs
to
be
choked
down
not
the
beast
thing
ive
ever
had
the
taste
grows
complex
as
the
ale
warms
the
bready
nutty
yeast
flavors
begin
to
dominate
the
fruit
and
the
alcohol
begins
to
become
evident
this
is
all
complimented
by
a
very
phenolic
almost
buttery
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
to
offset
the
phenols
moderately
drinkable
though
the
cost
is
prohibitive
overall
its
just
not
hitmeoverthehead
wierd
enough
if
i
wanted
an
easy
drinkin
beer
id
grab
a
nice
deutsches
bier
overall
nice
aroma
but
so
much
pithiness
on
the
flavor
could
age
to
become
dry
and
citrusy
this
is
less
than
a
year
old
so
the
best
thing
to
do
is
wait
this
beer
was
served
in
a
tulip
glass
poured
from
a
bottle
an
enthusiastic
head
greets
you
initially
and
stays
throughout
the
drinking
experience
it
has
a
medium
orangered
color
and
has
a
slight
sediment
that
settles
quickly
the
smell
only
hints
at
the
complex
flavor
that
is
hidden
within
each
time
i
raise
the
glass
to
my
nose
i
get
something
new
lots
of
hay
and
other
funky
barnyard
smells
the
taste
is
dry
with
a
flowery
hop
flavor
that
dominates
the
musty
and
yeasty
undertones
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
its
price
and
availability
in
my
location
make
it
something
that
i
have
to
save
for
special
occasions
id
drink
this
by
the
gallon
if
it
didnt
work
out
to
be
like
50
a
gallon
i
wish
i
could
get
this
fresh
too
as
this
isnt
particularly
fair
as
a
standalone
review
i
dont
like
this
beer
much
in
the
us
but
was
told
to
try
it
fresh
in
belgium
so
i
did
and
i
agree
that
this
is
a
good
tactic
i
found
it
better
more
complex
orangeish
color
with
big
thick
rocky
head
smells
of
characteristic
belgian
hops
dry
and
a
little
austere
also
with
some
yeast
juicier
and
more
complex
flavors
good
hops
the
appearance
is
auburn
with
lots
of
head
however
less
head
than
many
other
belgian
beers
the
aroma
is
vivacious
and
suggests
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
the
taste
is
very
enjoyable
wheat
is
evident
on
the
mid
palatte
and
the
aftertaste
is
mild
there
isnt
any
evidence
of
yeast
after
pouring
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
i
was
a
little
surprised
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
fairly
complex
absolutely
excellent
this
ale
pours
with
with
a
very
thick
and
creamy
head
and
is
dark
amber
in
color
toward
the
top
and
fades
lighter
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
very
hopdriven
fruity
spicy
and
the
alcohol
is
very
present
the
taste
is
nothing
that
i
have
ever
experienced
from
a
trappist
ale
good
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
the
mouthfeel
has
an
acidic
feel
to
it
but
overall
this
is
a
solid
ale
my
bottle
of
orval
has
a
bottled
on
date
of
24062005
ddmmyy
and
a
best
before
date
of
24062005
pours
a
cloudy
orange
red
with
a
voluminous
white
head
that
has
fairly
good
staying
power
that
leaves
an
island
of
foam
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
aroma
has
some
sour
guezelike
notes
with
some
spiciness
and
mustiness
as
well
taste
is
bone
dry
and
i
mean
bone
dry
think
of
the
driest
champagne
youve
had
and
multiply
it
by
ten
not
sour
tasting
at
all
but
with
a
peppery
finish
as
it
warms
up
i
get
some
more
fruitiness
now
im
thinking
that
ive
served
this
a
bit
too
cold
very
highly
carbonated
a
oneofakind
beer
notes
creamy
consistent
and
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
am
sorry
that
there
wasnt
more
when
i
was
finished
with
the
bottle
but
every
good
beer
is
like
that
hopefully
i
will
get
to
experience
this
great
brew
again
this
beer
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
head
it
had
a
good
strong
bitter
aroma
the
flavor
supprised
me
it
as
very
complex
with
hints
of
fruits
and
spices
over
everything
there
was
a
very
bitter
and
earthy
taste
that
i
found
overpowering
and
which
hurt
this
beers
drinkability
significantly
not
waht
i
expected
at
all
maybe
i
should
try
this
one
again
on
the
chance
that
i
got
an
odd
bottle
im
not
certain
what
to
make
of
this
beer
in
general
i
think
this
beer
would
make
an
excelent
session
beer
the
mild
great
flavor
wont
get
old
any
time
soon
also
the
alcohol
content
is
low
enough
so
you
should
be
able
to
enjoy
a
few
great
beer
i
will
definately
get
it
again
world
class
d
it
took
me
awhile
to
get
used
to
this
beer
but
now
i
can
definitely
enjoy
the
tart
brett
flavor
it
presents
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
fluffy
one
inch
head
a
stream
of
tiny
bubbles
rise
to
the
surface
of
my
glass
which
looks
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
peppery
with
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
hops
there
was
also
a
sour
note
to
this
beer
that
was
not
overwhelming
at
all
but
that
balanced
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
i
had
this
beer
several
years
ago
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
tasty
and
complex
maybe
my
tastes
have
changed
its
an
original
and
is
completely
different
from
any
other
trappist
beer
d
a
solid
example
of
the
style
with
its
unique
hop
characteristics
and
multifaceted
malt
tastes
leading
to
something
i
have
not
experienced
before
pours
rich
amber
with
massive
head
did
not
require
an
aggressive
pour
to
create
a
thick
blanket
of
foam
the
aroma
is
amazing
very
spicy
and
kind
of
floral
the
taste
is
drier
than
i
would
expect
from
the
aroma
but
very
pleasant
inhaling
the
aroma
while
sipping
maximizes
the
effect
of
the
sweet
spiciness
the
taste
is
also
kind
of
sour
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
cost
will
prohibit
most
people
from
drinking
a
lot
of
them
d
i
liked
orval
without
the
monster
pricetag
id
probably
buy
it
a
lot
more
often
went
well
with
the
moldy
cheese
i
ate
with
it
had
the
bottled
version
of
this
in
a
beer
tasting
event
it
pours
a
creamy
looking
light
caramel
color
with
a
good
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
musky
nose
the
flavor
is
a
smooth
fruity
to
fermented
fruity
flavor
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
rind
it
has
an
odd
bitter
finish
to
me
something
is
missing
in
this
beer
it
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
to
me
not
bad
overall
and
i
would
drink
it
again
especially
with
a
good
belgian
dish
drinkability
i
guess
maybe
i
expected
much
more
considering
its
a
trappist
and
also
that
its
around
5
a
bottle
still
really
good
but
i
dont
know
if
im
going
to
be
in
a
huge
hurry
to
buy
it
again
give
it
a
shot
though
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
a
nice
beer
that
is
worth
trying
again
drinkability
because
of
the
carbonation
level
its
a
tad
less
drinkable
for
me
but
not
because
the
flavor
was
bad
orval
brings
back
nice
memories
as
it
was
the
first
belgian
beer
i
ever
had
back
in
2002
i
remember
liking
it
then
but
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
like
this
guess
my
pallete
has
really
grown
from
3
years
ago
has
a
beautiful
thick
head
that
resonates
a
hoppy
sweetness
has
a
nice
caramel
color
with
hints
of
amber
a
very
strong
lacing
tastes
hoppy
but
without
strong
aftertaste
a
new
taste
for
me
cant
figure
out
quite
what
it
is
my
first
thought
was
hints
of
raisan
has
a
nice
frothy
feeling
to
it
with
fruity
undertones
of
lemon
and
orange
pours
a
fairly
dark
cloudy
orange
very
warm
and
with
glinting
sunlight
coming
through
the
head
is
massive
and
so
thick
that
it
almost
feels
like
cotton
candy
leaves
incredible
rocky
lacing
all
over
the
sides
of
my
chalice
and
maintains
a
thick
covering
over
the
surface
for
as
long
as
the
beer
lasts
aroma
is
insanely
complex
subtly
alcoholic
which
surprised
me
given
its
fairly
modest
abv
spices
and
breads
are
the
dominant
aromas
lots
of
fruits
ranging
from
the
very
dark
raisins
and
plums
through
the
light
and
delicate
apples
and
bananas
with
citrus
and
gloriously
rich
sweet
malts
incredible
tastes
bready
musty
notes
of
brett
and
wild
yeast
spicy
as
well
cloves
and
pepper
in
the
mix
with
lots
of
fruits
banana
and
orange
are
predominant
as
well
long
and
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
full
and
very
warming
superb
drinkability
was
incredible
for
a
trappist
i
wanted
to
keep
drinking
these
all
night
nothing
warms
me
up
quite
as
well
on
a
snowy
night
as
orval
does
gets
better
every
time
i
have
it
and
is
now
one
of
my
absolute
favourite
beers
of
all
time
flawless
overall
as
i
stated
above
this
beer
was
just
too
strong
and
bitter
which
was
surprising
considering
how
sweet
it
smelled
maybe
giving
it
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
would
have
mellowed
it
out
and
made
it
more
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
with
little
head
and
a
little
lacing
smell
is
aromatic
smells
like
oregano
interesting
taste
is
smooth
little
bitterness
and
an
aroma
of
cloves
mouthfeel
is
not
too
bad
a
little
alcoholic
but
still
goes
down
alright
its
not
something
you
want
to
take
big
gulps
from
but
it
isnt
too
bad
and
is
worth
having
again
appears
a
murky
orange
brown
colour
with
a
foamy
head
and
large
bubbles
aroma
of
cooked
vegetables
and
spices
particularly
nutmeg
some
medicinal
type
aromas
there
too
rather
strange
flavour
celery
possibly
very
complex
the
vegetables
nutmeg
and
also
five
spice
come
to
mind
but
its
also
fresh
hoppy
perfumy
and
a
little
salty
fairly
high
carbonation
but
not
too
much
at
this
alcohol
level
and
temperature
overall
quite
an
unusual
taste
one
is
enough
for
me
im
afraid
to
say
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
it
but
ill
still
rate
it
reasonably
well
for
its
complexity
and
originality
poured
into
an
orval
chalice
this
was
a
gorgeous
ciderlike
hazy
burnt
orange
with
an
outstanding
chunky
white
head
which
laced
like
crazy
smell
was
unbelievable
absolutely
mouth
watering
with
a
range
of
notes
from
bananas
freshly
cut
grass
generic
citrus
and
yogurt
lol
anyways
really
a
beer
that
i
would
actually
refer
to
as
having
a
true
bouquet
flavors
are
refreshing
and
spicy
full
of
flowery
suggestions
yeasty
bananas
and
plenty
of
orange
peel
delicious
and
classic
the
only
thing
that
holds
down
the
drinkability
is
that
i
want
to
drink
it
faster
than
my
wallet
can
buy
it
d
a
thouroughly
enjoyable
brew
flavorful
only
6
2
makes
for
easy
drinkin
i
need
to
try
another
orval
to
see
if
this
is
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
taste
i
had
great
expectations
but
this
brew
certainly
didnt
meet
it
dull
hazy
golden
amber
with
huge
rocky
white
head
fluffy
ringed
lacing
aromas
of
apple
yeast
coriander
mineral
water
biscuity
malts
tastes
spicy
indefinite
with
bready
malts
dull
lemony
citrus
rind
and
a
biting
yeast
finish
alcohol
comes
through
solidly
too
juicy
carbonated
mouthfeel
but
quite
dry
overall
very
nice
easydrinkin
trappist
ale
can
i
actually
say
that
overall
a
very
flavorful
beer
with
a
unique
hop
charater
to
boot
march
8
2006
ive
just
had
an
aug
29
2005
bottle
and
subsequently
increased
the
taste
from
a
4
5
to
a
5
mouthfeel
features
a
burst
of
champagneesque
carbonation
that
streaks
across
the
mouth
with
each
sip
a
mellow
medium
body
allows
for
easy
drinking
but
maybe
the
bubbles
could
be
toned
down
a
tad
drinkability
is
really
quite
wonderful
as
it
goes
down
smooth
and
each
sip
brings
a
new
realm
of
taste
sensations
i
would
not
mind
seeing
this
in
750ml
bottles
purchased
this
precellared
for
me
at
liquor
stop
in
highland
in
didnt
even
look
at
the
date
when
i
bought
it
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
fresh
bottle
to
try
in
the
near
future
another
testament
to
the
wonders
of
the
trappist
breweries
of
belgium
this
will
go
down
as
one
of
my
new
favorites
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
one
which
i
guess
can
explain
the
juiciness
as
each
sip
refreshes
the
tongue
as
far
as
drinkability
this
one
is
good
although
the
high
price
for
11
2
ounces
of
the
stuff
will
probably
steer
me
away
unless
its
a
real
special
occasion
judging
it
based
soley
on
the
liquid
itself
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
a
real
treat
i
found
it
interesting
that
pouring
the
remainder
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
into
my
glass
really
rounded
out
the
flavor
so
if
you
find
the
flavor
a
bit
disagreeable
give
that
a
try
cheers
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
most
of
my
pleasure
coming
from
what
the
small
proportion
of
wild
yeast
brings
to
it
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
poured
this
into
a
watou
chalice
pours
a
golden
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
slowly
disappears
little
lacing
smell
is
light
and
a
bit
fruity
with
a
copper
tone
and
hops
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
not
much
of
a
malt
taste
slightly
fruity
citrus
a
little
wheaty
slight
hint
of
alcohol
but
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
good
on
this
beer
very
smooth
over
the
palate
drinkability
is

brew
my
first
belgian
pale
ale
i
believe
so
really
nothing
to
compare
to
but
its
totally

than
other

one

ive
seen
on
a
beer
smells
perfumyvinous
with
rubber
glove
phenols
cough
medicine
and
some
lemon
juice
first
sip
throws
me
for
a
loop
tastes
like
a
rubber
glove
its
like
im
at
the
dentist
the
next
flavor
is
cough
medicine
like
robitussin
or
something
and
maybe
other
medicinal
flavors
thats
pretty
much
all
i
can
detect
maybe
some
perfumy
hops
it
loses
a
lot
of
flavor
toward
the
end
the
strong
phenols
may
be
the
intent
of
those
monks
but
they
rub
me
the
wrong
way
and
really
affect
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
but
am
disappointed
ill
try
again
sometime
to
see
if
it
will
taste
different
maybe
its
better
when
fresh
or
when
properly
cellared
for
a
while
a
quaffable
trappist
ale
poured
out
to
a
hazed
orange
golden
hue
with
a
nice
white
foam
head
and
rigns
of
lace
in
the
tulip
glass
higher
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
herbs
and
spices
with
some
malt
in
the
background
taste
was
decent
but
far
from
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
belgian
pale
ale
flavors
of
hay
bitter
malt
and
hops
grain
and
alcohol
fill
the
palate
somewhat
of
a
bland
character
as
well
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
rather
creamy
overall
drinkability
is
good
enough
nothing
special
here
there
are
better
trappist
ales
to
be
had
mouthfeel
is
sudsy
very
soapy
full
of
bubblyness
fairly
drinkable
but
i
dont
know
the
nose
and
certain
flavors
make
me
feel
like
i
could
really
like
this
but
the
metalic
thing
is
turning
me
off
ill
have
to
hunt
down
an
older
bottle
and
compare
pours
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
dense
maranguelike
super
persistant
head

dropping
to

the

leaves
any

behind

not

quite
a
feat
ester
flavors
of
dried

intense
dryness
leading
to
acidic
finish
that
suggest
a
fine

around

like
all
belgiums
crys
out
for
a
fine
meal
to
be
paired
with
the
legend
pour
this
brew
from
the
thiny
bottle
which
btw
doesnt
look
anything
but
special
into
a
burgundy
glass
and
you
will
know
why
actually
the
foam
looks
like
the
fermentation
would
be
in
full
process
besides
the
looks
smell
and
aroma
all
in
harmony
and
balance
drink
this
one
slow
and
taste
how
the
aromas
change
over
time
unique
this
is
definitely
differenti
wouldnt
make
a
huge
habit
of
it
but
its
intriguing
to
try
a
beer
so
similar
to
a
very
dry
champagne
neat
stuff
poured
a
dark
orangeamber
color
into
my
recently
acquired
duvel

nice

taste
is
of

light
fruits
with
a
nice

finish
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
having
the
appropriate
weight
for
the
style
overall
dinkability
is
good
i
would
recommend
one
tries
this
brew
once
but
it
is
a
bit
pricey
to
continue
enjoying
beyond
one
body
is
between
light
and
medium
alive
with
soft
effervescence
and
has
a
crisp
fluffy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
sessionable
if
you
can
afford

a
bottle
here
in
charlotte
overall
a
goodtasting
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
will
buy
again
if
i
am
ever
in
the
mood
for
this
style
again
i
would
probably
go
with
duvel
i
hadnt
tried
an
orval
in
a
while
but
decided
it
was
time
seems
to
me
it
is
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
could
use
a
lilttle
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
sour
notes
towards
the
end
of
the
second
glass
i
started
eating
some
tatertots
and
some
store
brought
meat
balls
this
proved
to
be
a
good
move
cause
it
showed
me
how
well
this
brew
can
go
with
foods
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
to
recommend
anything
but
the
spicey
bitterness
went
well
with
what
i
had
overall
another
world
class
trappist
those
that
dont
love
it
just
need
to
have
it
with
food
thats
when
it
really
shines
for
begin
the
first
trappist
ale
i
would
say
not
to
bad
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
is
good
enjoyed
this
one
more
then
normal
drinkability
is
only
as
good
as
taste
here
i
was
truly
optimistic
about
this
but
overall
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
end
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
one
dthis
is
a
very
soft
yet
complex
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
however
some
of
the
flavors
that
are
not
as
pleasant
tend
to
shine
through
more
that
i
would
like
very
drinkable
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonic
bitterness
pours
a
very
cloudy
orangebrown
big

the

refuses
to
go

taste
is
orange
lots
of
sweet
malt
yeast
and
a
spicy
bitter
finish
medium
mouthfeel
high
rough
carbonation
tart
sour
aftertaste
good
beer
although
not
my
favourite
trappist
although
interesting
loved
the
color
and
appearance
of
this
beer
nice
orange
color
with
plenty
of
head
retention
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
exploding
to
the
surface
very
fruity
smell
almost
like
a
chardonnay
couldnt
wait
to
taste
it
taste
was
okay
but
was
expecting
more
based
on
appearance
and
smell
not
very
complex
and
nothing
that
really
makes
you
stand
up
and
take
notice
mouthfeel
was
interesting
felt
very
foamy
almost
like
it
was
forming
a
head
in
my
mouth
overall
a
decent
beer
pours
almost
clear
in
appearance
leaving
a
high
foamy
head
4
fingers
worth
in
the
glass
with
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
aroma
of
grape
juice
and
fruityness
with
clean
crisp
smell
second
pours
reveals
a
more
golden
apperance
but
stiill
with
transperancy
a
slight
hint
of
orange
and
grape
flavor
kind
of
like
champagne
beer
a
very
light
and
crisp
taste
flavor
is
like
a
knife
to
the
palate
extremely
drinkable
after
finishing
this
bottle
i
didnt
want
another
the
weight
of
the
beer
combined
with
its
flavor
profile
was
too
heavy
although
the
balance
was
excellent
edit
ok
ive
had
a
chance
to
drink
this
one
several
more
times
and
was
trying
to
be
somewhat
conservative
in
my
early
reviews
but
i
simply
love
this
beer
and
see
no
reason
to
not
give
it
perfect
marks
wish
i
had
one
right
now
very
good
beer
this
beer
tastes
good
and
its
fairly
low
alcohol
for
a
trappist
but
i
find
myself
actually
wanting
to
finish
this
bottle
and
move
on
to
something
else
ill
certainly
try
it
again
next
time
i
can
get
ahold
of
it
and
this
time
ill
open
it
up
when
its
a
few
degrees
cooler
but
at
this
temperature
i
really
dont
enjoy
it
as
much
as
id
like
to
north
coast
pranqster
is
much
better
and
much
cheaper
one
of
the
only
knocks
i
could
have
on
this
beer
is
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
spritzy
some
may
like
it
that
way
i
wish
it
was
toned
down
just
one
level
and
it
would
have
gotten
5s
opinion
all
i
can
really
say
is
wow
this
beer
is
really
amazing
i
have
had
it
on
multiple
occasions
but
that
was
after
quite
a
few
beers
as
my
first
beer
of
the
evening
it
really
shines
there
is
a
really
complex
flavor
and
aroma
profile
that
is
not
done
justice
after
you
have
already
had
something
else
to
drink
this
is
one
world
class
beer
that
you
have
to
try
all
by
itself
to
really
appreciate
excellent
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
this
is
not
my
favorite
belgian
ale
but
it
is
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
strong
aftertaste
takes
a
long
time
to
fade
amazing
stuff
solid
orange
in
colour
with
a
pillowy
justoffwhite
head
aromas
of
hops
lavender
and
grapefruit
flavorful
grapefuit
complex
floral
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
it
also
has
a
long
and
sour
finish
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
some
other
trappist
ales
but
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
overall
i
guess
by
now
you
know
i
loved
this
ale
love
is
a
word
carelessly
abused
and
overused
i
truly
love
this
beer
now
i
know
why
its
known
for
one
name
and
one
name
only
orval
worth
every
penny
maximum
respect
ive
had
quite
a
few
that
were
left
to
age
and
that
made
the
voyage
across
the
atlantic
and
found
them
to
be
much
more
sweet
and
aromatic
the
sweetness
of
honey
wild
grasses
and
jasmine
all
come
out
as
the
medicinal
taste
subsides
over
time
i
like
that
the
drink
before
date
is
a
full
5
years
after
thebottled
on
date
a
really
excellent
choice
but
try
to
catch
one
on
the
back
end
of
those
5
years
drinkability
not
your
typical
trappist
ale
too
much
like
an
ipa
for
my
tastes
what
a
crazy
tasting
beer
seriously
i
dont
know
what
to
say
the
most
unique
beer
of
the
trappist
family
a
must
try
for
certain
overall

an
amazing
beer
unlike
anything
else
it
certainly
is
an
acquired
taste
one
of
my
favourites
this
is
a
funky
beer
but
if
youve
become
acclimated
to
sharpertasting
beer
its
very
enjoyable
i
recommend
it
drinkability
personally
if
i
spend
nearly
5
on
a
trappist
i
want
a
higher
abv
this
tame
trappist
pale
ale
at
6
2
is
a
lightweight
compared
to
its
relatives
overall
nice
to
try
but
nothing
ill
be
running
back
to
the
store
to
buy
again
i
am
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
it
looks
like
a
winner
the
bottle
is
gorgeous
it
pours
wonderfully
with
a
sexy
head
the
lingers
nice
lacing
but
im
drinking
beer
for
taste
the
looks
are
just
part
of
the
package
without
a
doubt
this
is
my
least
favorite
trippist
to
date
im
glad
i
only
have
oneto
be
honest
tasted
in
de
zolder
bierceller
bar
bruges
may
2005
poured
beautifully
perfectly
presented
in
its
correct
chalice
lovely
head
over
amber
to
redbrown
body
smell
is
a
wakeup
call
reminded
me
of
dank
seaweed
very
different
some
would
quake
at
this
point
but
i
always
wanted
to
taste
orval
so
continued
thankfully
it
tasted
better
that
the
tough
smell
in
fact
its
taste
improved
as
i
drank
the
glass
delighted
to
finally
taste
this
beer
it
is
a
fairly
complex
beer
for
connoiseurs
i
am
not
quite
in
that
category
yet
but
my
apprenticeship
continues
serious
beer
respect
dn
wonderful
beer
and
a
testament
to
the
monks
who
brew
it
very
complex
a
joy
for
all
the
senses
overall
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
price
i
think
ill
visit
other
belgiums
again
before
this
one
drinkable
but
again
if
this
is
your
thing
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
tough
one
after
all
of
the
glowing
reviews
i
have
read
i
found
the
reality
somewhat
disappointing
looks
absolutely
fantastic
glowing
deep
dark
gold
with
a
massive
head
good
retention
lacing
etc
also
smells
promising
classic
flowery
funky
dare
i
say
horseblanket
aromas
taste
well
the
first
disappointment
dry
then
bitter
overwhelming
anything
else
that
might
be
present
i
also
found
the
palate
a
little
watery
although
there
was
plenty
of
carbonation
it
was
course
rather
than
fine
like
some
of
the
other
belgians
i
have
enjoyed
sorry
but
while
it
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
is
unbalanced
and
overrated
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
a
great
meal
bottled
on
12004
and
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
golden
amber
with
an
immense
foamy
offwhite
head
and
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
sticking
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
earthy
hay
apples
cloves
brown
sugar
caramel
spruce
really
complexevery
sniff
gives
something
new
mouthfeel
was
extremely
dry
and
tart
flavor
is
very
complex
with
sweet
sweet
maltiness
puckering
tartness
peppery
spices
and
a
dry
hoppy
bitterness
all
coexisting
this
is
a
good
belgian
much
less
sweet
and
more
bitter
than
others
ive
tried
which
makes
it
interesting
the
finish
is
champagnequality
dryness
with
a
residual
fade
of
funky
yeasty
goodness
received
in
bif18
from
babydoc
wow
poured
into
the
snifter
a
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
rocky
head
leaving
a
entire
doilies
around
the
glass
smell
is
barnyard
and
candy
lots
of
sweet
farm
aroma
taste
is
spices
cloves
and
more
farmhouse
flavors
with
some
candy
sweetness
and
hops
this
is
complex
and
my
palate
language
is
inadequate
to
the
task
mouthfeel
is
full
and
there
is
some
crispness
toward
the
end
while
this
is
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
it
is
easy
to
consume
despite
the
complexity
every
now
and
then
when
working
out
you
have
to
check
your
one
rep
max
orval
is
an
analogous
experience
a
must
try
beer
for
everyone
not
sure
i
really
care
for
orval
definitely
an
acquired
taste
imo
and
i
like
the
sharp
tartness
of
a
lambic
or
flanders
red
or
the
sharp
bite
of
brettanomyces
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
well
with
this
beer
maybe
ill
age
one
a
couple
years
and
see
what
happens
but
for
now
im
ambivalent
at
best
about
orval
finger
licking
good
taste
the
flavor
is
pretty
clean
in
the
onset
then
changes
to
a
strange
herbal
bitterness
it
was
a
flavor
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
aftertaste
lasts
for
a
long
time
so
if
you
like
the
flavor
you
get
to
absorb
it
for
a
long
time
after
the
sip
medicinelike
phenols
were
very
persistent
in
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
brew
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
i
could
barely
finish
the
bottle
poured
with
a
huge
tan
head
i
always
have
a
little
trouble
fitting
one
of
these
little
bottles
into
glasses
that
technically
should
hold
all
of
the
contents
not
just
lace
but
foam
clings
to
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
very
unusual
citrusy
quality
strange
i
guess
because
it
also
smells
somewhat
like
sour
apple
all
at
once
the
malt
is
way
beneath
this
citrus
and
pungence
in
the
profile
the
taste
is
different
than
what
the
nose
suggests
a
warming
lightly
bready
malt
body
citrusy
at
the
end
with
a
slight
aftertaste
which
is
alot
like
the
original
taste
orval
has
a
very
versatile
profile
so
the
food
pairings
for
this
ale
are
almost
infinite
11
2
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
07
10
2004
best
before
07
10
2009
purchased
at
greens
in
atlanta
ga
it
is
amazing
that
a
beer
can
be
this
full
flavored
and
complex
yet
delicate
and
subtle
at
the
same
time
idiots
the
taste
was
quite
bitter
especially
the
aftertaste
it
left
behind
which
makes
this
belgian
classic
a
bit
more
difficult
to
consume
large
amounts
of
but
still
overall
its
a
great
trappist
beer
which
i
would
recommend
to
all
especially
those
who
like
bitter
beers
overall
id
pick
orval
as
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
i
usually
prefer
the
darker
ales
but
this
beer
definitely
stands
out
above
the
pale
crowd
those
monks
have
learned
a
few
things
about
brewing
in
the
last
900
years
another
beer
that
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
poured
a
pale
copper
the
head
was
thick
and
faomy
but
oddly
unappealling
to
me
incredibly
sticky
and
stubborn
lace
there
was
nothing
distinctive
either
positive
or
negative
about
the
aroma
the
malts
were
very
mild
and
the
other
flavor
rearing
its
head
was
dried
apples
that
came
across
as
sour
cider
on
the
positive
side
the
overall
mouthfeel
was
crisp
overall
i
was
not
very
interested
in
this
beer
and
found
it
kind
of
a
turnoff
murky
yeasty
tanned
amber
big
active
head
exceptional
looking
white
froth
honey
and
floral
lavender
nose
dry
herbal
and
less
sparkling
than
i
expected
somewhat
hot
alcohol
throaty
feel
but
it
smooths
out
fairly
quickly
there
is
some
residual
slick
feeling
that
then
dies
off
quickly
not
too
smooth
and
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
being
extremely
versatile
it
reminds
me
of
duvel
but
i
like
duvel
a
lot
more
than
this
delicious
orval
is
a
beer
i
wish
i
had
tried
before
and
wish
i
had
more
of
pours
an
amberorange
with
a
slight
haze
large
fluffy
big
bubble
head
that
leaves
sticky
lace
on
the
chalice
smells
of
sweet
malts
sour
lambiclike
smell
lemon
grass
and
butter
taste
has
a
subdued
sweetness
with
a
blend
of
bitterness
kinda
generic
basically
very
well
balanced
with
bitterness
leading
sweetness
from
malts
butter
and
a
dry
candy
bitterness
from
grass
hay
lemons
the
lambic
sourness
and
a
bit
of
veggie
mouthfeel
is
like
a
dry
wine
an
excellent
beer
one
i
will
be
buying
as
soon
as
i
find
it
again
drinkability
well
its
crisp
and
refreshing
i
guess
i
dont
know
for
all
the
hype
theres
not
much
to
this
one
i
dont
know
if
ill
be
back
bottled
15703
served
in
a
tulip
glass
impressive
pour
orangeamber
with
a
huge
white
head
that
held
up
well
over
time
pleasant
odor
tiny
hint
of
citrus
complex
flavor
more
of
a
hoppy
bitter
character
than
im
used
to
with
belgians
plus
a
touch
of
sour
lemon
definitely
a
dry
clean
aftertaste
dont
know
how
this
beer
is
fresh
but
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
in
the
almost
2
years
since
it
was
bottled
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
this
one
has
great
drinkability
but
the
complexity
compels
you
to
sip
it
the
abv
makes
this
one
a
decent
session
beer
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
slightly
sour
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
good
beer
but
keep
your
mind
open
when
you
try
it
it
isnt
like
other
sweet
belgian
beers
at
all
this
is
really
one
of
my
favourite
beers
and
one
of
the
best
trappist
beers
it
pours
out
a
beautiful
amber
coloured
beer
with
a
nice
head
if
it
is
poured
in
the
one
and
only
orval
glass
of
course
the
smell
is
quite
unique
a
very
sour
and
malty
smell
but
that
is
not
how
the
beer
tastes
it
has
a
very
dry
taste
i
recognised
malt
and
a
sort
of
dry
bitterness
not
really
sour
in
all
its
simplicity
it
is
a
very
rich
beer
it
has
a
unique
aroma
an
aroma
i
cant
recognise
in
any
other
trappist
although
it
only
has
an
alcohol
percentage
of
6
2
it
tastes
like
it
is
stronger
and
it
can
be
very
dangerous
when
over
consumed
the
orval
beer
is
a
very
distinctive
beer
not
only
because
of
the
unique
taste
but
also
because
of
the
unique
shape
of
the
bottle
at
the
moment
i
am
enjoying
a
crate
of
them
and
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
them
a
medium
bodied
ale
with
an
enjoyable
dryness
and
a
unique
medicinal
taste
from
the
phenols
feels
moderate
to
high
in
carbonation
which
lends
to
the
dry
finish
this
beer
became
more
enjoyable
as
it
warmed
up
and
my
palette
adjusted
had
a
much
fresher
bottle
in
amsterdam
was
like
a
totally
different
beer
so
much
more
flavour
tasted
so
fresh
was
only
bottled
a
month
or
so
i
have
heard
of
people
aging
this
for
510years
but
i
dont
see
the
point
to
be
honest
the
bottle
i
had
on
my
first
encounter
was
pretty
bland
and
a
bit
dull
but
the
second
any
many
there
after
was
superb
holy
shit
what
an
amazing
beer
the
driest
so
complex
its
been
almost
ten
years
since
i
had
orval
its
better
than
i
remembered
huge
schizoid
steroidjacked
plume
of
froth
that
sticks
and
laces
in
a
grand
way
light
orange
to
a
tumescent
amber
hue
with
just
a
bit
of
haze
and
constant
action
orange
peel
lemon
zest
and
cut
grass
notes
on
nose
carbonation
jumps
on
and
all
over
the
mouth
but
followed
by
an
almost
vacuous
tinny
malt
flavor
with
some
light
fruity
undertones
of
chalky
grapefruit
and
pear
middling
overcarbonation
takes
points
off
very
complex
but
still
extremely
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
trappist
beers
this
is
the
beer
i
buy
for
myself
and
keep
to
myself
as
a
special
treat
because
of
its
distinctive
flavor
and
the
wallop
it
packs
in
alcohol
content
orval
has
a
rich
thick
head
that
you
could
almost
recognize
just
by
looking
at
it
without
seeing
the
label
the
flavor
is
dry
with
extremely
strong
somewhat
fruity
maltiness
that
borders
on
chalky
in
a
good
way
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
large
amount
of
head
which
takes
much
time
to
settle
the
smell
is
pungent
mostly
with
fruits
especially
that
of
apricots
like
coasterfreak75
said
the
smell
of
alcohol
is
also
prevalent
although
it
is
pretty
well
covered
up
the
taste
is
fruity
but
the
alcohol
taste
takes
hold
as
the
drink
goes
down
this
makes
it
much
less
smooth
and
makes
you
take
your
time
between
sips
it
also
lingers
for
a
long
time
after
the
beer
is
swallowed
with
the
same
alcoholheavy
taste
any
fan
of
a
strongflavored
drink
will
enjoy
this
especially
the
hopsheavy
pale
ale
lovers
out
there
all
and
all
a
good
trappist
at
best
still
well
worth
a
try
but
not
the
best
this
brew
is
a
sunset
orange
color
quite
a
sizable
cream
head
on
the
top
fair
amount
of
lace
sweet
bubblegum
on
nose
bananas
hints
of
lemon
fairly
light
bodied
sweet
light
malt
front
dusted
with
lemon
plently
of
a
nice
mix
of
spiciness
and
sweetness
big
hop
presence
quite
a
complex
brew
certainly
worth
trying
hazy
copper
to
orange
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
head
is
composed
of
huge
bubbles
that
give
way
to
a
clumpy
head
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
apples
and
pears
there
is
a
spiciness
there
too
mild
nutmeg
is
backed
by
a
light
doughy
scent
the
flavor
has
more
of
the
apples
and
pears
the
spiciness
comes
through
in
the
taste
but
has
more
clove
character
the
fruit
is
still
there
definitely
pears
now
and
backed
by
grapefruit
a
little
bit
of
fig
sweetness
on
the
finish
this
has
a
tartness
and
a
slick
mouth
feel
i
wasnt
expecting
very
nice
extremely
drinkable
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
into
my
goblet
a
bright
clear
amber
with
a
frothy
head
which
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
but
without
the
medicinal
smell
of
many
belgians
the
taste
is
earthy
grainy
and
very
dry
it
has
a
bitter
astringent
aftertaste
but
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
the
flavor
is
phenolic
as
usual
among
belgians
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
disappointment
with
very
high
carbonation
and
a
medium
light
body
overall
i
dont
think
this
beer
lived
up
to
the
hype
around
it
or
even
its
appearance
and
good
aroma
an
interesting
beer
that
is
not
so
bad
but
not
all
that
great
either
this
beer
has
grabbed
my
curiosity
for
awhile
but
i
never
fessed
the
loot
to
grab
it
in
favor
of
ipas
etc
thanks
to
tinustime
for
the
well
priced
bottle
pours
cloudy
straw
yellow
into
my
miami
dolphins
tapered
mini
beer
glass
the
head
is
huge
and
foamy
and
holds
steady
aroma
is
sweet
sour
full
of
apples
almost
burning
but
not
in
an
alcohol
way
more
acidic
very
nice
the
taste
is
very
unique
not
alot
of
malt
here
or
even
hop
flavor
really
there
is
a
ton
of
hop
dryness
and
bitterness
its
as
if
the
beer
dries
up
before
i
get
a
chance
to
taste
it
this
is
the
definition
of
clean
mouthfeel
is
quick
and
dry
making
this
pretty
drinkable
very
unique
ale
and
quite
refreshing
really
great
really
tasty
a
dry
dry
dry
belgian
pours
with
a
very
nice
golden
hue
with
thick
and
lasting
head
this
beer
almost
glows
in
the
glass
good
lacing
as
well
aroma
is
slightly
citruisy
and
peppery
taste
is
dry
dry
dry
its
hard
for
me
to
pick
up
other
flavors
going
around
i
do
pick
up
a
touch
of
pepper
in
here
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
overcarbonated
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
rest
on
the
head
of
this
beer
not
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
imho
this
is
such
a
subtle
belgian
i
would
recommend
it
only
to
those
just
starting
out
trying
the
style
most
certainly
i
would
recommend
this
as
the
first
beer
of
the
night
because
it
would
be
hard
to
appreciate
it
after
a
couple
other
bigger
beers
havent
had
many
trappists
yet
and
this
is
my
first
to
review
so
my
palate
is
not
quite
yet
accustomed
to
this
style
of
beer
may
have
to
edit
review
once
i
delve
deeper
into
the
trappist
family
a
gorgeous
beer
utterly
unique
and
extremely
tasty
i
just
wish
it
were
cheaper
comments
this
has
been
my
favorite
belgian
for
nearly
as
long
as
ive
been
aware
of
the
countrys
beers
ive
delayed
reviewing
it
for
so
long
out
of
fear
of
not
doing
it
justice
id
just
like
to
add
that
i
would
love
to
taste
more
hoppy
beers
which
utilise
wild
yeast
strains
oh
brettanomyces
what
cant
you
do
the
beer
erupted
into
a
large
frothy
white
head
regardless
of
the
careful
pour
the
foam
refused
to
subdue
itself
but
created
little
dimples
in
the
surface
the
smell
was
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
as
i
popped
open
the
cap
it
smelled
and
sounded
like
a
sparkling
champagne
even
tasted
a
bit
like
one
also
in
the
smell
was
something
that
seems
to
be
lacking
altogether
in
many
belgians
hops
it
is
by
no
means
a
hop
monster
though
as
the
malt
character
clearly
shows
through
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
as
well
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
between
maltiness
and
hoppiness
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
so
incredibly
smooth
i
cant
wait
to
take
another
drink
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
reveals
a
bit
of
alcohol
even
though
is
not
a
very
huge
beer
at
6
9
according
to
the
label
as
i
said
before
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
buy
some
i
cant
believe
this
is
one
of
the
last
trappist
ales
ive
tried
if
westy
8
and
12
can
live
up
to
their
hype
i
think
i
will
have
reached
beer
nirvana
if
they
are
better
than
this
this
is
a
great
taste
of
history
this
poured
copper
with
a
thick
head
that
retained
and
left
soft
peaks
yep
just
as
a
fine
meringue
beautiful
smell
was
complex
and
fruity
lemon
and
other
indistinguishable
fruit
maybe
some
apple
pie
as
well
nice
crisp
tart
taste
again
some
lemon
taste
rich
and
complex
smooth
finish
fruity
notes
mouthfeel
presents
as
well
carbonated
crisp
and
a
bit
creamy
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
fantastic
not
a
session
brew
but
one
to
be
savored
truly
a
great
beer
class
all
the
way
as
part
of
a
session
tonight
this
one
stood
out
this
was
such
a
simple
pure
beer
nothing
about
it
was
meant
to
be
overboard
or
in
your
face
like
most
new
school
american
beers
the
balance
achieved
in
this
fine
ale
is
absolute
bliss
for
the
senses
i
only
bought
one
and
i
am
kicking
myself
for
it
now

even
want
to
drink
it
but
i
will
high
carbonation
and
creaminess
in
the
mouthful
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
some
spices
and
noticible
alcohol
some
stale

very
rough
is
it
possible
i
got
a
bad
bottle
are
my
tastebuds
off
tonight
i
havent
read
any
other
reviews
of
this
yet
if
im
way
off
from
others
then
perhaps
ive
got
a
dud
on
my
hands
either
that
or
this
really
isnt
my
thing
pours
a
bright
golden
orange
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
it
is
quite
clear
from
looking
at
this
beer
that
there
is
a
ton
carbonation
from
this
brew
as
the
bubbles
dont
stop
shooting
up
aromas
are
a
mix
of
citrus
lemony
tones
and
acetic
almost
cat
piss
like
funk
there
is
also
some
interesting
barnyard
aromas
flavors
start
off
very
spritzy
to
this
brew
with
an
in
your
face
carbonation
that
just
explodes
on
the
pallate
theres
a
heavy
dosage
of
lemony
citrus
flavors
with
hints
of
spice
following
there
is
a
yeasty
estery
like
flavor
that
brings
about
quite
a
dryness
to
this
beer
there
is
a
decent
acidic
punch
throughout
this
beer
which
just
a
light
dosage
of
maltiness
and
a
slight
sugary
sweetness
overall
this
brew
was
very
spritzy
and
citrusy
but
of
all
the
trappists
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
there
is
something
mysterious
and
unreal
about
this
beer
when
i
drank
it
something
made
me
keep
on
thinking
of
spiders
it
had
a
creepiness
that
tried
to
scare
me
off
then
i
had
nightmares
after
going
to
sleep
which
is
extremely
rare
for
me
i
think
there
is
some
kind
of
a
curse
on
this
beer
seriously
good
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
body
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
body
to
this
one

slick
but
tempered
with

i
could
drink
this
beer
all

the

was
well

but
to
some
the
smell
may
be
to
their
liking
just
a
matter
of
preference
all
and
all
though
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
legendary
6
true
trappist
ales
give
it
a
go

go
figure
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
wit
a
thick
overflowing
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
boasts
of
pale
malts
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
light
and
citrousy
it
has
a
musty
aftertaste
but
goes
down
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
fair
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
it
drinks
well
i
thought
the
taste
was
good
it
just
was
a
little
too
foamy
all
in
all
this
was
pretty
decent
the
taste
is
of
smoothness
giving
way
to
sourness
and
a
hint
of
lemon
that
gives
way
to
a
bite
with
hoppy
undertones
good
but
a
little
more
maltiness
would
have
been
in
order
the
beer
is
light
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
hint
of
the
alcoholic
content
in
the
aftertaste
in
truth
i
would
love
to
drink
this
all
night
were
it
not
for
the
price
it
came
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
amber
color
with
quite
an
impressive
foamy
offwhite
head
that
laced
down
the
side
of
the
glass
but
diminished
greatly
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
a
noticeable
banana
ester
with
a
general
floral
hop
smell
to
complement
it
it
tastes
spicey
bananay
and
somewhat
bitter
it
isnt
an
overwhelming
flavor
fairly
mild
i
really
thought
it
was
excessively
carbonated
it
really
fills
your
mouth
and
more
up
with
gas
pretty
quickly
burp
overall
not
bad
not
great
but
a
little
overcarbonated
this
is
my
first
review
i
chose
to
wait
and
review
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
start
this
beer
poured
a
very
bright
almost
flourescent
orange
color
with
a
lively
white
head
lots
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
strongly
yeasty
and
slightly
fruity
the
flavor
brought
about
a
bouquet
of
fruits
mostly
tarty
and
citric
yeast
however
dominated
my
palate
and
was
overwhelming
at
times
it
was
also
slightly
bready
at
times
the
finish
was
extremely
dry
this
was
a
well
made
well
carbonated
beer
but
it
was
nothing
spectacular
to
me
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
unique
in
comparison
to
the
other
trappist
beers
much
much
dryer
on
the
palate
similar
to
champagne
or
a
dry
white
wine
has
a
sweeter
cherry
fruit
flavor
that
cuts
the
tartness
in
the
finish
very
dry
the
alcohol
is
pretty
undetectable
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
sneaks
up
just
a
little
and
warms
you
nicely
very
dry
citrusy
and
highly
drinkable
exceeded
my
expectations
pours
a
golden
orange
with
an
enormous
white
foamy
head
quite
a
site
to
see
i
made
the
mistake
of
using
a
tulip
glass
i
think
i
needed
something
a
bit
bigger
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
and
a
little
sweet
very
fizzy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
kind
of
burns
you
on
the
way
down
light
fruity
citrusy
taste
a
little
on
the
sour
side
and
also
a
good
deal
of
spice
ends
fairly
dry
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
bit
more
flavor
overall
a
nice
brew
but
not
my
favorite
trappist
pours
a
thick
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
a
huge
frothy
and
creamy
beige
lasting
head
that
leaves
clingy
sheets
of
lace
in
my
glass
nice
malty
and
sweet
spicy
aroma
sweet
and
fruity
sugar
flavors
nice
and
smooth
creamy
soft
mouthfeel
full
body
with
lively
carbonation
finishes
with
a
pleasant
spicy
aftertaste
i
didnt
expect
to
rate
this
one
very
high
its
appearance
resembles
a
duvel
which
i
like
less
than
when
i
reviewed
it
the
orval
is
a
remarkable
enlightenment
for
me
suggesting
i
give
the
duvel
another
look
but
no
i
think
its
just
the
superiority
of
this
complex
strong
pale
belgian
ale
this
one
belongs
in
my
personal
top
five
fantastic
all
around
wow
overall
acceptable
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
pours
hazy
murky
orange
with
big
frothy
head
that
left
quickly
left
nice
lace
and
of
carbonation
bubbles
aromas
of
orange
peel
coriander
champagne
yeast
and
some
sour
apple
are
present
flavors
of
sweet
mild
malt
thin
spiciness
and
closes
with
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
extraordinary
very
lively
in
the
mouth
them
monks
was
spicy
devils
lovely
slightly
dark
yellow
appearance
and
friuty
aroma
but
a
sip
reveals
the
spicy
hop
flavor
with
a
mild
alcohol
backdrop
carbonation
is
tingly
fruit
in
the
center
and
a
clean
dry
finish
good
powerful
stuff
and
something
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
tasted
at
bistro
des
bières
belges
on
montreals
south
shore
in
a
bottle
labeled
69
rather
than
the
6
2
suggested
here
while
pouring
the
liquid
you
come
to
understand
whats
with
everyone
talking
about
all
the
unique
flowers
in
the
aroma
from
this
legendary
trappist
beer
lilac
is
all
over
the
place
your
nose
doesnt
even
have
to
be
close
to
the
nice
graallike
glass
the
numerous
and
regular
bubbles
escape
relatively
fast
leaving
just
a
perfect
relatively
small
white
head
the
taste
is
very
spicy
with
coriander
citrus
and
just
so
many
i
cant
name
bitterness
steps
in
and
dance
in
unity
with
those
spices
among
the
flowers
a
nectar
overall
decent
but
the
sour
medicinal
aftertaste
knock
this
1
down
a
notch
havent
made
up
my
mind
on
whether
i
like
that
barnyard
character
yet
this
is
definitly
an
unique
beer
and
certainly
worth
a
try
two
years
later
new
stock
of
orval
bad
aroma
not
really
there
this
time
but
i
am
not
the
only
one
to
notice
how
many
skunked
orvals
are
about
bottled
on
october
24
2002
best
before
october
24
2007
i
couldnt
afford
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
its
a
great
change
of
pace
pourred
an
orangy
brew
with
what
i
consider
to
be
the
most
beautiful
beige
head
head
retention
for
orval
is
what
other
brewers
should
aspire
to
since
it
is
the
longest
lasting
i
have
ever
experience
taste
is
of
complex
spice
with
great
fruit
aroma
also
great
wheat
taste
with
a
strong
body
one
of
the
best
trappist
in
my
opinion
final
update
tried
this
one
last
time
after
having
given
my
palate
a
chance
to
adapt
to
belgians
such
as
achel
quintine
westvleteren
rochefort
bink
etc
also
followed
the
suggestion
of
other
bas
and
made
this
beer
my
first
selection
of
the
evening
net
result
i
no
longer
think
is
completely
vile
however
the
odd
and
rather
unpleasant
medicinalorajel
flavors
noted
previously
remain
though
being
much
more
subdued
than
i
recall
while
it
was
more
palatable
on
my
third
try
i
still
cannot
recommend
this
beer
i
upgraded
my
taste
rating
to
2
5
spoils
of
the
101103
knoxville
raid
it
has
a
very
clean
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
body
and
no
watery
tinges
it
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
that
i
might
have
given
a
5
to
for
taste
and
drinkability
except
that
i
think
there
is
still
a
beer
out
there
that
will
be
better
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
one
you
should
i
wish
the
price
was
such
that
i
could
make
it
a
regular
thing
i
do
not
enjoy
the
white
wine
quality
of
this
ale

was
a
beergoal
of
mine
for
some
time
now
found
with
the
help
of
beerfly
sydney
oh
to
send
off
a
moving
brotherinlaw
we
bought
two
at
4
79
each
we
opened
one
poured
into
nonorval
approved
glassware
the
slight
offwhite
head
was
huge
massive
if
not
in
the
way
for
it
settled
very
slowly
what
comes
to
pass
after
the
head
is
very
nice
thick
rings
of
sticky
lace
an
orangeamber
cloudy
haze
of
liquid
appears
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
or
straight
lemon
the
taste
is
smooth
with
a
tart
hop
bite
the
body
is
mid
to
thin
the
mouth
is
left
dry
thirsty
drinkable
yes
knowing
the
history
the
abbey
the
monks
very
cool
ill
keep
the
other
until
the
brotherinlaw
returns
to
use
the
orval
approved
glassware
that
i
have
so
far
unused
this
is
one
to
linger
over
and
not
put
away
by
the
bucket
full
good
to
imbibe
as
part
of
a
beer
and
cheese
evening
when
i
poured
the
yeast
the
smell
was
of
manure
im
not
sure
why
i
decided
to
drink
it
but
im
thankful
that
the
taste
was
nothing
like
the
aroma
the
yeast
was
somewhat
tart
with
a
bit
of
pepper
this
remains
a
challenging
characterful
brew
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
when
fresh
it
is
quite
a
bit
different
still
good
but
in
a
fresh
hoppy
sort
of
way
i
love
that
the
belgians
still
embrace
ornery
spoilage
organisms
in
their
brews
it
makes
for
a
much
more
colorful
world
drinkability
to
me
this
is
the
most
different
from
all
the
other
trappists
obviously
much
mess
sweet
decent
drinkability
alothough
it
is
not
nearly
my
favorite
trappist
im
suprised
it
ranks
so
highly
i
wonder
if
this
is
bc
it
is
labelled
a
trappist
pours
an
orange
kinda
tainted
tone
which
reminds
me
of
the
sorta
pale
ale
that
sierra
nevada
has
and
the
product
itself
is
very
similar
a
tough
bitter
sweetness
both
in
nose
and
taste
that
while
being
good
is
not
all
that
great
for
my
taste
les
goûts
et
les
couleurs
ne
se
discutent
pas
but
still
is
a
nice
refreshing
maltyhoppy
blend
that
works
always
the
trappistes
at
orval
have
passed
the
test
an
absolutely
stunning
ale
very
complex
and
wonderful
this
bottle
was
quite
young
so
the
flavors
were
a
lot
more
raw
a
bit
more
bitter
and
hoppy
than
some
of
the
older
bottles
ive
tried
an
interesting
drink
even
if
you
get
an
old
beatup
mishandled
bottle
the
balance
between
malt
sweetness
and
the
bitterness
fluctuates
a
lot
over
time
as
does
the
flavors
coming
from
the
bacterial
profile
swirling
up
all
the
sediment
and
dumping
in
the
glass
towards
the
end
is
always
a
tasty
bonus
after
a
session
of
several
top
quality
beers
its
awesome
to
finish
the
night
with
one
of
these
just
to
put
it
all
in
perspective
its
almost
enuff
to
make
me
want
to
join
a
monastery
overall
impression
a
mild
but
very
complex
flavor
a
nice
blending
of
spice
malt
and
yeast
that
gives
an
impressive
but
again
milder
taste
while
this
is
obviously
a
wellmade
beer
it
just
didnt
strike
a
chord
with
me
which
hurt
its
drinkability
score
in
my
book
one
you
should
try
once
to
see
if
it
strikes
a
chord
with
you
this
brew
fits
no
specific
style
it
is
truly
a
one
of
a
kind
experience
the
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
somewhat
hazy
with
a
thick
mediumbubbled
head
the
smell
was
spicy
fruity
and
very
breadyyeasty
a
bit
of
banana
in
there
too
the
taste
was
spicy
too
spicy
really
like
someone
accidentally
dropped
a
large
container
of
white
pepper
in
the
batch
a
bit
of
malt
was
hiding
back
there
and
the
finish
was
just
as
strong
spiced
with
a
tinge
of
clovenumbness
the
overabundance
of
white
pepper
was
just
too
strong
to
truly
enjoy
this
one
but
it
paired
with
some
roquefort
cheese
very
well
comments

sorry
not
my
idea
of
the
style
pop
a
pranqster
or
la
fin
du
monde
to
see
what
i
prefer
or
better
yet
read
thelongbeachbums
review
of
the
avec
les
bons
voeux
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
but
for
the
price
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
any
time
soon

very

tastes
orange

grapefruit
malty

and

mellow

incredibly

beer
definitely
not
for
everybody
but
world
class
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
it
didnt
think
it
was
that
bad
but
i
was
very
disappointed
especially
considering
the
lengths
ill
have
to
go
through
to
get
another
to
try
judging
from
the
awesome
reviews
it
may
be
that
i
purchased
a
lackluster
bottle
i
will
try
it
again
and
see
if
it
kicks
my
ass
the
way
it
seems
to
have
others
anyway
the
head
on
this
fellow
was
a
virtual
monster
massive
and
foamy
the
head
stays
and
stays
the
beer
pours
a
good
copper
blonde
with
some
orange
highlites
aromas
are
ripe
and
fruit
driven
with
flavors
of
grapefruit
citrus
peel
and
fruitcake
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
the
taste
is
at
once
bitter
citrus
hopinessveryredolent
of
citrus
zest
or
oil
the
whole
emphasis
in
flavor
seems
to
center
on
bright
twangy
citrus
and
i
betting
this
is
a
fantastic
food
wine
ill
try
it
with
some
whitefish
and
potato
and
report
back
i
think
i
score
the
drinkability
a
bit
low
as
this
seems
most
certainly
made
for
food
vs
simply
sipping
i
will
try
again
and
re
review
as
needed
this
is
a
good
one
one
of
my
favorites
i
recently
made
a
trappiste
ale
and
the
best
one
of
mine
that
i
tasted
came
out
of
the
orval
bottle
i
used
during
bottling
maybe
its
a
monklike
sign
fishy
at
the
least
get

this
fine
beer
is
cloudy
deep
golden
with
an
enormous
creamy
head
it
has
an
intense
overwhelming
but
lovely
aroma
of
ensilage
horse
stable
leather
and
spicy
fruit
cake
the
flavour
is
complex
and
spicy
hops
stand
out
the
aftertaste
is
dry
but
could
have
lasted
a
little
longer
still
this
is
clearly
a
world
class
beer
definitely
moreish
cloudy
amberish
color
with
visible
floating
setiment
nice
head
that
doesnt
disappear
quickly
an
exquisite
musty
hoppy
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
nice
classic
complex
hop
taste
which
lingers
nicely
in
the
mouth
way
it
coats
the
mouth
may
not
mix
well
with
many
foods
but
to
savor
by
itself
is
great
glob
of

a
dark

color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
cloves
the
taste
is
spicy
and
slightly
sour
a
little
weird
very
unique
a
bit
of
hops
and
nutmeg
to
the
super
dry

fairly
strong

color
with
a
massive
cratered
head
that
seemed
to
last
forever
aroma
is
that
of
citrus
and
floral
kind
of
odd
for
a
beer
to
smell
like
a
flower
garden
taste
is
tart
and
very
acidic
with
its
medium
carbonation
it
finishes
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
it
doesnt
really
leave
any
aftertaste
behind
different
to
say
the
least
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
just
to
see
this
beer
is
a
textbook
example
of
how
a
beer
should
present
itself
huge
carbonation
creates
a
dense
chunky
head
that
rises
in
a
column
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
big
carbonation
also
carries
a
great
aroma
full
of
bannanas
with
hints
of
spices
and
other
fruit
the
lacing
is
outstanding
as
great
as
the
beer
looked
and
smelled
the
taste
was
a
bit
disapointing
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
bitter
acidic
and
had
an
unpleasant
coppery
taste
ill
drink
it
again
but
it
isnt
something
i
plan
to
make
a
habit
of
pours
a
hazy
golden
almost
orange
with
a
monstrous
orangishwhite
headwow
smell
is
sour
bitter
and
floral
very
interesting
like
nothing
ive
smelled
before
taste
is
sour
and
bitter
with
a
sharp
dry
yeasty
fruity
acidic
finish
is
there
alcohol
in
this
ahh
the
gentle
warming
halfway
into
this
beauty
says
yes
this
beer
feels
amazing
crisp
intriguing
carbonation
that
just
envelops
the
mouth
i
would
drink
this
regularly
if
it
werent
6
a
bottle
this
brew
poured
an
extremely
invigorated
head
of
creamy
white
bubbles
and
a
cloudy
light
orange
body
with
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
my
mug
it
has
a
mild
malty
aroma
and
a
flavor
that
is
slightly
fizzy
with
notes
of
spice
and
hops
it
is
very
dry
in
its
finish
and
has
no
lingering
aftertaste
all
in
all
it
is
a
very
nice
brew
a
nice
belgian
that
would
take
a
while
to
get
used
to
drinking
pours
out
looking
very
much
like
apple
cider
with
a
half
inch
head
of
off
white
froth
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
fruit
and
sour
at
that
this
follows
through
in
the
flavor
which
comes
across
as
a
sour
fruit
taste
no
doubt
this
is
a
very
complex
with
great
complexity
if
one
is
willing
to
get
past
the
opening
nosewrinking
smell
and
taste
there
is
clearly
a
great
malt
base
and
dandy
yeast
and
hops
at
work
here
enjoyable
depends
on
your
point
of
view
everything
prior
to
the
taste
was
great
full
and
complex
but
finished
with
a
medicinal
flavor
i
found
it
a
little
disappointing
interesting
enjoyed
alas
never
to
meet
again
this
particular
brew
poured
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
there
was
carbonation
observed
rising
to
the
top
of
my
glass
the
body
was
cloudy
and
an
orangish
color
this
brew
had
a
fruity
aroma
to
it
this
is
one
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
rating
and
drinking
poured
a
very
nice
orange
color
with
huge
rocky
head
i
have
yet
to
purchase
a
nice
trappist
ale
glassthe
aroma
was
slightly
peppery
and
a
little
tart
taste
is
pretty
dry
with
a
slight
peppery
tinge
to
it
i
liked
this
more
than
what
i
thought
i
would
not
as
sour
as
what
i
thought
it
might
bevery
well
done
a
fabulous
original
beer
and
a
true
piece
of
history
the
bowling
pin
bottle
is
great
and
the
freshness
date
had
me
good
until
the
fall
of
2007
colour
is
a
murky
midrange
coppery
orange
and
the
foam
on
this
bad
boy
is
a
sight
to
behold
big
thick
and
chunky
lingering
the
whole
way
down
the
chalice
and
leaving
behind
an
impressive
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
herbal
and
citrusy
some
earth
tones
as
well
taste
is
tartsour
and
flowery
with
a
tart
lemon
rind
aftertaste
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
yeasty
and
a
little
fruity
alcohol
and
spice
give
it
almost
a
rumlike
smell
the
front
is
peppery
with
some
grapes
giving
it
a
dry
winelike
flavor
interesting
the
middle
goes
slightly
sour
with
hints
of
apples
the
tang
is
almost
a
little
tonicwatery
the
finish
is
a
fantastic
fresh
dry
bready
experience
with
noticeable
alcohol
theres
almost
a
red
wine
aftertaste
very
dry
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
a
great
complex
original
beer
the
word
trappist
immediately
imparts
high
expectations
and
i
cannot
honestly
say
orval
lived
up
its
a
good
beer
but
it
was
almost
as
if
i
was
witnessing
a
catfight
between
the
yeast
and
the
hops
they
were
both
there
but
they
didnt
achieve
any
sort
of
harmony
ive
had
it
twice
and
ive
made
up
my
mind
it
simply
isnt
a
3bottle
beer
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
and
it
looks
great
in
my
collection
but
that
simply
aint
enough
this
is
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
17
years
of
enjoying
fine
craft
beer
the
head
on
this
beer
is
unbelievable
i
poured
this
beer
in
its
dedicated
orval
glass
and
drank
it
slowly
which
lasted
about
2030
minutes
the
head
stayed
at
a
peak
the
entire
duration
and
even
after
the
last
sip
it
was
still
hanging
on
to
the
side
of
the
chalice
for
its
dear
life
the
flavor
was
so
unique
and
complex
that
it
will
most
likely
require
several
additional
samplings
to
accurately
define
what
im
sensing
burnt
sugar
stale
fruit
earthy
malty
taste
i
dont
know
perhaps
my
palate
doesnt
possess
the
sophistication
for
this
one
what
i
do
know
is
that
it
was
a
most
enjoyable
if
not
a
religious
experience
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
hmmm
beer
as
a
religion
what
a
concept

2
oz
33l
bottle
i
was
not
overly
impressed
by
this
offering
in
fact
a
little
dissappointed
it
poured
ok
the
classic
light
color
cloudy
yellow
i
have
come
to
exspect
from
the
belgiums
but
after
that
it
just
fell
apart
the
abv
was
not
balanced
imho
properly
too
much
alcohol
taste
the
hops
werent
very
impressive
yes
they
were
there
but
showing
up
is
only
half
the
work
i
felt
they
didnt
blen
well
it
went
down
in
a
forceful
way
each
sip
anticipating
its
taste
not
in
a
good
way
ill
refrain
from
this
beer
in
the
future
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
an
interesting
beer
especially
for
the
aroma
you
dont
find
many
like
this
one
this
beer
has
an
angelic
experience
about
it
the
slightly
hazed
glowing
amber
body
just
lets
the
beer
gods
sing
down
on
you
the
head
forms
chunky
like
clouds
in
the
heavans
lacing
is
fine
intricate
belgian
style
all
day
aromatics
bring
out
the
barnyard
funkiness
that
makes
this
a
new
experience
everytime
ive
come
across
it
again
more
zestiness
sharp
citrus
appeal
from
the
hops
with
a
spicy
pepper
kick
that
just
works
so
nicely
here
acidic
nature
waves
in
as
well
bringing
out
lactic
acid
notes
and
cider
like
comparisons
in
my
brain
the
more
yeast
that
makes
it
into
the
glass
the
funkier
it
gets
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
great
definitely
a
brew
i
will
always
cherish
effervescent
and
drinkable
but
definitely
needs
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
good
meal
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
belgian
which
surprised
me
given
its
high
reviews
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
large
head
citrus
like
aroma
the
taste
is
citrusy
and
a
little
tart
i
wasnt
expecting
the
tartness
but
it
is
definately
welcome
here
i
have
a
feeling
this
beer
could
be
paired
well
with
a
large
variety
of
foods
this
beer
definately
stands
out
from
the
other
trappist
ales
unfortunately
its
too
expensive
to
drink
regularly
this
is
a
beautiful
active
pour
golden
amber
with
a
monstrous
head
reminiscent
of
a
root
beer
float
active
carbonation
on
the
way
up
and
swirls
of
sediment
on
the
way
down
subtle
clean
grain
smell
with
spiciness
on
the
fringes
eminently
smooth
texture
with
a
complex
palate
that
ranges
from
a
sweet
malty
start
to
a
very
crisp
middle
and
dry
warm
finish
a
very
pleasant
find
i
think
everyone
should
try
this
beer
and
if
it
interests
youput
a
bottle
or
two
away
color
is
a
really
nice
amber
with
a
yellowy
glow
at
the
bottom
and
the
head
is
silky
smooth
and
tightly

i
came
across
this
one
on
a
recomendation
from
the
barkeep
at
the
steelgarden
within
the
bethlehem
brew
works
it
is
not
a
restaurant
it
is
an
experience
pretty
much
what
a
basic
belgian
brew
should
be
it
offers
a
balanced
nose
with
a
fullbodied
spicey
yet
not
too
spicey
bier
a
very
flexible
bier
to
go
along
with
just
about
any
kind
of
bar
food
even
the
really
spicey
stuff
prost
tremendous
work
obviously
went
into
this
beer
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
but
its
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
of
the
trappist
i
have
tried
this
is
not
high
on
the
list
but
not
bad
at
all
its
awful
perty
though
not
my
favorite
trappist
i
will
continue
trying
to
make
sure
i
have
had
the
best
representative
of
the
brew
but
nothinng
new
and
its
been
done
better
pours
out
red
amber
with
a
big

citrus
tastes
are
strong
as
are
other
spice
the
hops
balance
this
quite
nice
and
cut
the
flavors
off
when
they
should
end
the
aftertaste
is
quite
dry
making
you
want
more
more
more
if
you
like

youll
dig
this
fine
brew
so
smooth
so
good

is

frothy
white
aroma
is
overwhelming
and
enticing
from
afar
extraordinarily
spicy
very
enticing
and
seductive
though
i
havent
even
even
brought
this
brew
close
to
my
nose
yet
an
arousing
blend
of
the
sweet
and
the
sour
with
some
citric
notes
speaking
up
here
and
there
loads
of
sugar
and
spice
and
well
everything
nice
fierce
hops
on
the

and
an
excellent

great

long

delicious
with
plenty
of

satisfactory
very
mellow
and
pacifying
this
is
a
brew
that
tastes
of
the
history
it
contains
a
very
unique
pleasurable
and
pacifying
beverage
very
attractive
orangeishgold

mostly
clear
with

aroma
is
yeasty
fruity
and
spicy
with
hints
of
orange
grape
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
incredibly
assertive
i
could
detect
almost
no
sweetness
at
all
in
the
first
sip
lemony
and
acidic
the
flavor
profile
is
dominated
by
tart
fruit
and
spicy
tastes
followed
by
a
big
earthy
floral
hop
finish
overall
impression
in
the
mouth
is
very
crisp
almost
sharp
a
bit
harsh
on
the
tongue
for
me
with
a
very
dry
finish
i
found
that
adding
the
yeast
to
the
glass
rounds
the
flavor
out
a
bit
and
leaves
a
much
more
mellow
beer
it
pours
a
beautiful
honey
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
its
a
very
nice
looking
beer
the
smell
is
on
the
light
side
citric
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
citrus
and
quite
tart
almost
sour
its
a
very
dry
beer
and
leaves
the
sensation
of
disappearing
almost
immediately
upon
hitting
the
tongue
i
must
confess
to
being
slightly
disappointed
i
really
enjoy
the
tartness
in
this
beer
lemony
spicy
hops
then
a
slightly
bitter
and
crisp
finish
this
beer
is
different
than
other
belgians
i
have
tried
in
that
its
more
tart
and
pungent
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
purchase
it
regularly
the
aroma
is
very
distinctive
lemon
and
a
least
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
terrific
but
damn
hard
to
describe
very
nice
taste
almost
lemony
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
but
much
more
so
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
pleasant
and
very
long
lasting
i
hear
you
either
hate
it
or
you
love
it
and
i
love
it
and
the
taste
goodness
i
love
it
im
a
big
fan
of
beers
with
a
bit
of
a
tart
edge
to
it
and
this
is
just
perfect
it
has
a
sour
acidic
quality
to
it
while
maintaining
a
high
level
of
drinkability
while
some
friends
of
mine
have
described
it
as
tastes
like
a
horses
ass
i
find
it
engaging
and
unrestrained
how
can
you
not
like
a
beer
that
combines
sweetness
with
an
almost
poisonous
natural
leaves
behind
a
satiny
sheet
of
fine
lace
the
aroma
of
ripe

first
thing
i
notice
about
this
brew
is
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
present

to
pour
this

carefully
the
second
thing
i
notice
is
a
very
strong
aroma
pretty
nice
somewhat
fruity
and
phenolic
some
leather
and
sweet
candy
this
beer
is
a
chill
hazed

shows
an
incredible
amount
of
carbonation
in
the

of
the
beer
as

in

is
very

some

subdued

amongst

if
this
is
what
i
have
to
look
forward
to
next
time
orval

takes
the
belgian

give
it

most
striking
about
the
flavor
of
orval
is
the
relatively
assertive

that
prevents
malt
sweetness
from
becoming
dominant
when
combined

drinking
an

is
a
unique
experience
each
time
the
fruitiness
o
hits
the
right
notes
for
the

with
a
tart
citrus
theme
augmented
by
a

of

there
all
the

a
good

and
solid
attempt
at
a

can
be
subtle
and
nuanced
this
is

distinct

i
cant
pick
them
out
of
the
lineup
regardless
this
is
a
superb
brew
mystery
notwithstanding
spicy
bitter
hops
are
there
but
mild
nothing
stands
out
as
far
as
flavors
or
hints
basic
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
id
like
to
come
back
to
and
try
again
overall
well
balanced
with
a
light
feel
and
very
good
flavor
that
gets
better
as
the
beer
warms
closer
to
stout
serving
temperature
o
not
a
bad
beer
though
not
exactly
what
i
anticipated
the
more
you
get
into
it
the
more
you
recognize
a
characteristic
weyerbacher
flavor
in
part
that
sort
of
nutshell
toastedwood
thing
that
i
just
recently
noticed
in
their
barleywine
interesting
enough
to
try
out
once
in
awhile
overall
an
excellent
beer
taste
starts
with
assertive
and
dry
yeast
moving
to
white
pepper
and
clove
then
banana
orange
peel
lemon
and
sour
apple
in
the
middle
with
a
dry
yeasty
slightly
citric
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
very
high
carbonation
a
touch
of
graininess
overall
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
this
beer
and
it
took
me
until
the
last
one
to
win
me
over
yeast
makes
the
beer
here
and
it
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
i
would
have
it
again
o
another
solid
offering
from
weyerbacher
they
hit
the
basics
bang
on
but
there
isnt
quite
enough
zing
to
make
this
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
still
id
drink
it
again
overall
this
poor
bastard
is
yet
another
example
of
how
poorly
this
style
ages
i
love
that
there
are
breweries
out
there
making
beers
like
this
but
an
enjoy
by
date
should
be
front
and
center
this
embarrassment
of
a
beer
does
not
represent
the
style
or
the
brewery
with
any
class
its
too
bad

overall
overall
a
very
tasty
bpa
it
had
a
fantastic
taste
and
feel
and
is
one
i
will
certainly
come
back
to
again
and
again
o
pleasant
aromatic
belgian
pale
ale
with
prominent
yeast
flavor
somewhat
displeasing
bitter
aftertaste
othis
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
leaves
alot
to
be
desired
and
is
over
powered
by
a
belgian
yeast
that
i
do
not
find
pleasant
over
whelming
in
the
taste
and
does
not
leave
the
mouth
with
a
good
finish
nothing
fantastic
here
but
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
awfully
easy
drinking
for
a
6
9
abv
o
ok
for
the
style
straightforward
tastes
like
a
belgian
beer
without
the
dryness
or
thinner
body
of
a
tripel
lovely
to
behold
in
the
glass
with
an
head
the
color
of
aged
plaster
lots
of
lace
on
the
sides
and
a
decent
retention
and
fade
a
dusky
orange
fluid
that
has
just
a
touch
of
cloudiness
smell
has
lots
of
pilsner
malt
and
belgian
candi
sugar
hops
are
spicy
and
well
developed
but
not
overpowering
a
touch
of
alcohol
that
leads
to
a
spicy
peppery
quality
taste
is
superb
with
a
big
malt
body
that
unfolds
the
layers
of
the
grains
in
a
delicious
bready
showcase
candi
sugar
adds
a
refined
sweetness
and
the
hops
are
a
wonderful
surprise
with
an
american
persona
feel
is
supple
with
a
velvet
carbonation
and
swallow
superior
drinkability
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
bigger
growler
overall
a
nice
bpa
in
my
opinion
the
yeast
strain
is
a
nice
characteristic
to
the
beer
o
true
belgian
quality
and
character
allowing
for
some
american
hops
in
an
ale
from
pennsylvania

this
pours
a
hazy
dirty
copper
color
with
a
lingering
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
sort
of
yeasty
mix
with
bananas
the
taste
starts
off
kind
of
sweet
with
lots
of
malt
and
banana
flavors
as
the
flavors
progress
it
turns
into
this
yeasty
bread
taste
that
finishes
a
little
chalky
with
hints
of
caramel
left
behind
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
making
this
a
pretty
decent
brew
overall
this
is
a
very
good
almost
great
belgian
ale
very
balanced
and
really
tasty
i
enjoyed
the
fresh
growler
fill
more
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
belgian
singles
can
get
too
yeasty
at
times
in
my
opinion
this
does
a
great
job
of
being
incredibly
drinkable
and
tasty
give
it
a
try
if
you
find
it
the
weyerbacher
tap
room
is
always
a
good
place
to
taste
it
o
solid
belgian
pale
ale
o
a
very
average
beer
ive
had
it
a
couple
times
when
it
was
around
but
probably
wont
go
back
again
nothing
terrible
but
nothing
particularly
good
or
interesting
poured
orange
in
color
but
was
not
cloudy
or
hazy
at
all
pretty
clear
nose
is
light
coriander
and
clove
notes
but
not
much
else
going
on
taste
is
syrupy
and
bitter
not
hoppy
or
very
spicy
spices
are
trying
to
come
out
but
they
dont
really
make
it
syrupy
bitterness
lingers
on
in
the
mouth
not
very
refreshing
this
may
have
been
an
old
bottle
overall
a
damn
good
bpa
very
imaginative
love
the
citrus
and
yeast
really
left
a
lasting
impression
on
me
i
will
have
this
again
for
sure
beautiful
orange
color
served
in
a
glass
not
much
of
a
flothy
head
wonderful
aroma
nice
feel
and
taste
a
little
bit
strong
aftertaste
very
similar
to
my
favorite
beer
stella
artois
however
packed
with
more
flavor
will
buy
this
again
it
was
highly
recommended
verboten
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
some
gentle
lighter
orange
highlights
theres
only
about
a
finger
of
bone
colored
foam
sitting
atop
the
beer
the
nose
is
highlighted
by
some
pleasant
esters
aromas
of
granny
smith
apples
and
white
wine
grapes
waft
out
of
the
glass
offset
by
a
dash
of
clove
the
flavor
profile
starts
off
with
a
similar
nice
fruity
notes
phenols
assert
themselves
a
bit
more
here
on
the
back
end
than
in
the
smell
and
unfortunately
they
move
past
clove
and
have
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
unpleasantness
to
them
the
body
is
maybe
just
a
little
full
for
the
style
but
thats
a
minor
issue
a
little
bit
more
of
a
concern
is
the
noticeably
dull
carbonation
its
not
nearly
lively
enough
for
a
good
belgian
ale
verboten
isnt
anywhere
near
being
an
unpleasant
beer
it
just
misses
the
mark
a
bit
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
simple
it
has
decent
flavor
and
drinkability
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
the
taste
begins
the
same
as
the
smell
but
doesnt
have
any
staying
power
there
is
a
small
bitterness
towards
the
end
light
and
easy
drinking
not
great
but
good
and
i
will
be
picking
up
more
on
one
of
my
future
visits
to
the
brewery
this
was
a
nice
well
balanced
flavorful
beer
overall
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
it

it
all

just
the

get
you
back
for
more

the

seems
to
be
sweeter

others

for

from

quite

enjoying
this
very
much
on
a
sunny
afternoon
a
nice
tasty
and
fairly
complex
beer
no
real
alcohol
presence
and
pretty
enjoyable
i
would
buy
again
for
certain
good
without
being
over
the

a
nice

strong

is

and
yeasty

it

exactly
subtle
bitter
nip
firm
smooth

has
wellrounded
body
and
quite
a
bit

fizz
dont
forbid
this
from
your
beer
selection
overall
it
was
as
expected
for
an
american
belgium
pale
ale
and
even
more
tasty
if
you
can
find
a
case
which
is
under
30
bucks
overall
this
brew
is
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
too
well
rounded
to
make
a
point
not
a
hopheads
dream
belgian
pa
i
wont
call
it
boring
because
its
well
crafted
and
gets
more
interesting
as
it
warms
up
theres
a
lot
to
be
said
for
its
easygoing
drinkability
but
it
will
be
forbidden
from
future
purchases
so
i
can
concentrate
on
styles
that
are
more
my
favorites
o
very
happy
i
grabbed
a
6pack
not
exactally
my
thing
but
im
sure
alot
will
love
it
too
much
white
grape
juice
for
my
liking
nice
and
spicy
and
fruity
tho
ill
try
it
again
next
year
o
perfect
for
the
spring
time
as
well
as
in
the
summer
im
sure
a
solid
americanstyled
bpa
glad
they
made
this
yearround
nothing
incredibly
exciting
with
this
beer
but
it
is
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
belgian
pale
very
enjoyable
on
a
warm
spring
day
definitely
recommended
pretty
good
belgian
effort
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
modest
to
small
offwhite
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
brown
amber
aroma
is
close
to
a
hefeweizen
spicy
bananas
bread
dough
flavor
is
like
nose
nicely
balanced
as
a
result
of
carbonic
tang
and
the
the
other
factors
body
is
appropriate
and
well
executed
finish
is
like
flavor
has
good
length
and
yields
a
desire
for
another
sip
good
brew
o
i
really
enjoy
verboten
because
it
has
all
the
flavors
i
am
looking
for
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
while
maintaining
great
drinkability
i
have
had
just
about
every
weyerbacher
beer
and
this
continues
to
be
the
one
i
turn
to
most
regularly
it
doesnt
have
the
highest
ratings
on
this
site
but
i
love
the
stuff
d
im
really
glad
this
brew
is
bottle
conditioned
adds
a
zest
to
the
fruity
flavors
that
is
much
appreciated
the
hops
are
there
but
are
slightly
overwhelmed
with
the
yeast
the
malt
body
provides
enough
of
a
backbone
to
make
it
work
overall
a
pretty
tasty
bel
pale
pours
a
hazy
blonde
with
a
touch
of
sediment
and
a
small
white
head
nose
is
strong
and
a
mix
of
bananas
belgian
yeast
and
citrusy
hops
flavor
is
surprisingly
complex
front
is
mostly
floral
and
bitter
hops
that
come
out
strong
and
the
flavor
shifts
to
banana
and
a
funktanginess
that
goes
well
with
the
carbonation
which
is
quite
high
finish
is
clean
and
keeps
a
touch
of
banana
lingering
without
over
doing
it
another
solid
brew
from
weyerbacher
a
simple
easy
to
enjoy
good
and
basic
version
of
the
style
drinkability
is
fairly
solid
thin
medium
body
slightly
lower
carbonation
feels
a
bit
weak
and
watery
drinkable
and
pretty
refreshing
but
theres
definitely
some
better
examples
of
the
style
around
belgian
flavors
are
there
but
lie
beneath
a
rather
unique
hop
profile
big
flavor
for
a
smaller
brew
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
belgian
pale
ale
another
great
brew
from

me
o
good
pale

the
flavors
are
very
nice
especially
as
it
warms
i
would
try
it
again

the

intensely
complex
with
an

and
a
new
flavor
around
every
corner
quite
enjoyable
d
this
combination
of
two
styles
i
like
is
worked
together
in
harmony
and
makes
for
an
exceptional
belgian
pale
ale
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
so
flavorful
yet
not
overpowering
on
the
palate
and
a
lower
level
of
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
want
a
few
in
a
row
taste
of
a
darker
brew
maybe
a
quad
tastes
malty
sweet
a
bit
of
hops
lots
of
flavor
its
a
very
good
brew
a
nice
session
beer
by
weyerbacher
who
normally
makes
some
high
abv
brews
so
it
nice
to
be
able
to
drink
a
few
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
solid
belgian
style
pale
ale
and
one
ill
look
for
again
on
draft
o
overal
this
beer
wasnt
that
bad
wish
there
had
been
a
nice
head
to
it
or
something
but
still
not
bad
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
a
perfect
example
of
a
solid
bpa
thats
not
too
inyourface
its
beginning
to
seem
like
these
guys
dont
make
bad
beer
or
even
subpar
beer
this
beer
tries
so
hard
to
be
straight
out
of
the
trappist
books
and
ill
have
to
say
that
it
does
a
really
good
job
it
just
doesnt
come
full
on
as
youd
hope
it
lacks
a
little
of
the
breadyyeasty
flavor
that
really
makes
the
trappist
beers
unique
but
its
a
great
shot
from
something
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
o
this
is
actually
the
zotten
rather
than
the
verboten
which
i
randomly
picked
up
at
my
local
shop
im
guessing
this
is
aged
about
2
years
by
now
since
it
was
recalled
sometime
early
2010
not
sure
what
flavors
would
fade
in
that
time
but
its
still
very
good
simple
yet
balanced
and
varying
between
aroma
and
taste
i
usually
like
the
beers
that
weyerbacher
puts
out
but
unfortunately
this
one
is
a
total
miss
for
me
i
dont
prefer
the
phenolic
yeasty
flavors
in
general
and
this
one
dials
it
up
a
few
notches
overall
a
good
autumn
to
early
winter
beer
well
balanced
flavors
and
mouthfeel
provide
an
excellent
sipping
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
moderatelylacing
white
head
bready
yeasty
aroma
with
fragrant
fruit
notes
slightly
phenolic
but
tolerable
at
that
similar
taste
bready
spicy
belgian
yeast
pears
apple
skins
with
a
drying
hop
sensation
following
medium
body
a
bit
chewy
and
nicely
drinkable
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
though
i
cant
really
complain
after
trying
this
brew
the
aroma
had
some
complexity
to
it
and
then
you
take
a
sip
and
have
a
nice
surprise
from
the
unexpected
finish
my
only
real
nitpick
if
i
mustand
i
must
is
the
appearance
the
head
just
disappeared
on
mewhich
may
be
my
own
fault
regardless
i
can
easily
see
myself
getting
another
6pack
or
recommending
this
to
friends
this
is
an
enjoyable
drink
holds
belgian
qualities
in
a
lighter
body
and
easier
drinking
drink
the
rest
of
the
bottles
will
be
easy
to
consume
the
aftertaste
of
honeysuckle
spices
and
wheaty
grains
has
a
whisp
of
evaproative
taste
that
extends
into
the
next
sip
all
culminates
in
a
sweeter
and
less
complex
belgian
ale
than
whats
offered
from
authentic
belgian
breweries
but
this
beer
compares
well
with
others
brewed
in
the
u
s
like
ommegang
bpa
or
even
belgian
brewed
leffe
blonde
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
clean
high
quality
very
solid
beer
o
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
not
much
special
about
this
one
ive
never
been
a
belgian
style
fan
i
think
its
the
fruity
bubble
gum
clove
flavor
that
really
puts
me
off
not
my
style
i
guess
if
you
like
these
flavors
you
will
enjoy
this
one
drinkabilityoverall
overall
this
beer
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
to
enjoy
largely
due
to
large
amount
of
hoppiness
that
stops
alot
of
the
sweetness
many
belgians
can
have
i
think
though
it
creates
good
drinkability
the
only
downside
of
this
beer
to
me
can
be
the
hops
are
so
dominate
it
probably
takes
away
some
the
complexities
lurking
in
there
from
the
belgian
yeast
and
overall
decent
ale
that
would
please
a
hop
lover
looking
for
slight
belgian
twist
final
thoughts
although
this
is
may
be
an
older
bottle
it
still
has
plenty
going
on
im
pretty
new
to
the
belgian
pales
but
this
one
tastes
like
a
lighter
tripel
strong
banana
on
the
taste
boozy
etc
it
was
good
but
this
is
me
basing
it
off
of
only
having
two
belgian
pales
before
if
your
looking
for
a
lighter
tripel
buy
this
age
it
a
bit
and
boom
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
and
reasonably
priced
as
well
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
hangs
around
a
while
the
smell
is
a
mild
sweet
smell
with
some
orange
coming
through
the
taste
is
spicy
i
get
some
clove
and
coriander
i
taste
the
yeast
and
some
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
has
a
decent
mouth
feel
with
a
little
bit
of
a
after
taste
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
blend
of
light
malt
phenolic
yeast
and
bright
hops
on
the
flavor
with
each
playing
a
prominent
role
hops
lend
some
lemongrassesque
flavors
on
the
end
that
is
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
but
wonderfully
creamy
almost
get
some
bananas
and
coconut
as
it
warms
up
kind
of
has
an
overall
zesty
tropical
vibe
to
it
very
good
i
will
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
overall
not
a
very
smooth
beer
but
good
flavor
overall
i
absolutely
love
the
flying
dog
raging
bitch
belgian
ipa
so
this
is
a
step
down
from
that
more
mild
in
flavor
than
a
belgian
ipa
but
very
drinkable
at
5
9
a
perfect
summer
beer
when
your
looking
for
something
other
than
a
witbier
with
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
without
the
high
abv
a
well
done
yearround
beer
from
weyerbacher
d
a
very
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
would
gladly
welcome
a
chance
to
drink
this
in
the
future
and
will
likely
invest
in
another
six
pack
at
some
point
in
the
future
overy
drinkable
and
at
5
6
it
is
something
to
keep
in
stock
it
is
bottle
and
keg
conditioned
so
aging
this
would
be
a
fun
experiment
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
nig
head
of
white
on
top
that
only
slowly
faded
as
the
session
wore
on
dropping
tons
of
lace
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
richness
to
it
that
looked
just
fantastic
as
it
warms
up
aroma
of
light
fruit
touches
hints
of
a
light
grassy
touches
maybe
pine
apples
and
grape
skin
start
to
come
to
the
front
as
it
warms
up
and
it
gets
a
very
complex
touch
to
it
smooth
even
flavor
here
really
quite
wonderful
light
and
airy
on
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
light
touches
of
apples
and
bananas
hints
of
light
peach
and
a
delicate
touch
of
grape
are
all
coming
out
at
me
nice
bready
and
grainy
touch
to
it
now
as
well
really
again
very
well
done
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
smooth
texture
light
level
of
carbonation
but
easy
drinking
there
is
not
much
alcohol
impact
by
any
regards
which
i
think
really
boosts
this
ones
enjoyment
level
for
me
unexciting
and
not
bold
by
any
means
but
i
think
that
is
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
offering
worth
a
try
o
not
a
bad
belgian
pale
ale
i
liked
it
a
lot
when
it
was
cold
but
as
the
glass
warmed
the
alcohol
and
some
harsh
flavors
came
through
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
belgian
pale
im
not
really
digging
the
metallic
notes
and
it
seems
a
bit
filtered
for
the
style
plus
the
abv
really
shouldnt
be
as
noticeable
as
it
is
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
cloudy
light
copper
pour
producing
a
big
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
good
aroma
of
stinging
hops
that
lead
to
a
very
faint
citrus
scent
along
with
musty
yeast
the
aroma
is
nice
but
you
gotta
dig
for
it
solid
bitterness
medium
bodied
very
dry
and
it
leaves
a
sticky
sweetness
behind
dry
wheat
biscuits
honey
mild
citrus
and
some
evergreen
candy
sugar
and
earthy
yeast
interesting
bottle
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
o
i
picked
this
up
off
the
shelf
for
a
mixed
six
pack
not
an
amazing
brew
buts
is
pretty
decent
it
did
hit
the
spot
on
this
hot
night
as
its
fairly
refreshing
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
style
was
surprised
to
taste
the
hops
in
here
really
is
a
good
sessionable
brew
that
i
will
look
for
again
really
good
stuff
here
this
is
a
very
clear
pale
golden
colored
beer
the
head
is
small
and
appropriately
whispy
moderate
lace
the
aroma
has
some
fruit
scents
orange
and
pear
and
a
little
spice
there
is
some
floral
scents
dried
orange
blossoms
estery
phenolic
not
much
malt
and
hop
aroma
though
the
taste
is
a
bit
hot
despite
the
moderate
abv
its
peppery
and
dry
the
carbonation
could
be
a
bit
higher
but
the
overall
body
is
firm
and
resilient
all
in
all
this
beer
is
just
average
this
is
slightly
darken
golden
brew
the
appearance
was
great
you
cant
clearly
see
through
it
so
its
not
a
typical
belgian
wheat
it
is
slightly
fruity
with
some
bitterness
to
it
i
poured
this
brew
from
a
bottle
to
a
glass
and
there
was
not
much
foam
associated
to
it
even
though
it
was
fruity
there
was
not
much
sweetness
and
there
was
a
dry
after
taste
o
probably
the
lightest
bodied
belgian
pale
ale
ive
had
its
rather
refreshing
and
well
crafted
the
flavors
are
simple
but
very
well
done
i
love
this
beer
it
smells
sublime
and
has
an
awesome
taste
to
go
with
it
the
wide
variety
of
esters
phenols
and
hop
characters
play
wonderfully
together
and
come
across
as
elegantly
complex
rather
than
as
a
garbled
mess
tasty
easy
drinking
and
easy
to
pair
with
food
two
thumbs
up
i
would
absolutely
buy
it
agian
overall
this
is
just
a
good
beer
the
hops
balance
perfectly
with
the
malt
background
and
the
belgiany
yeast
notes
this
could
also
be
a
great
beer
to
blend
with
a
belgian
lambic
beer
to
create
a
heavenly
fruity
belgian
ale
d
verboten
is
spot
on
for
the
style
with
an
above
average
flavor
would
recommend
to
an
avid
belgian
beer
drinker
easy
to
drink
but
want
to
savor
to
let
pallet
take
it
all
in
weyerbacher
serves
up
a
pretty
decent
belgian
pale
ale
with
verboten
but
they
put
their
own
spin
on
in
and
in
my
opinion
miss
the
mark
a
little
not
a
bad
not
a
great
beer
my
3rd
beer
from
this
brewery
and
my
least
favorite
loads
of
bubbles
and
snappy
light
flavors
work
well
together
an
unexpectedly
nice
beer
overall
very
pleasant
though
not
exceptional
example
of
the
style
the
slightly
strong
hop
presence
gives
away
the
beers
american
origins
m
mediumlight
body
with
low
carbonation
a
little
thin
o
its
not
bad
and
it
is
a
nice
brew
to
have
while
out
a
restaurant
i
bought
a
sixer
and
i
have
them
spaced
out
because
it
isnt
something
i
was
drawn
back
to
drinking
highly
drinkable
that
absolutely
looks
and
feels
great
the
flavor
is
a
little
tame
for
the
style
but
will
appeal
to
the
masses
in
that
regard
a
very
nice
and
well
rounded
beer
the
flavors
are
nice
and
clean
with
some
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
pale
it
isnt
examplary
but
i
reccommend
picking
up
a
six
pack
odhigh
drinkability
light
enough
to
be
a
great
warm
weather
beer
however
the
flavor
isnt
too
dulled
down
i
have
kept
my
distance
from
most
belgians
since
i
have
not
acquired
the
palate
for
it
yet
i
also
hear
american
interpretations
of
the
style
are
not
always
great
however
this
beer
may
help
to
usher
in
the
style
for
me
overall
4
5
although
b
is
a
good
score
i
thought
it
would
score
higher
it
is
almost
has
some
characteristics
of
a
saison
it
is
so
light
and
effervescent
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
as
i
enjoyed
it
greatly
the
aroma
is
excellent
and
the
flavors
held
up
when
it
was
a
bit
fresher
this
is
one
i
will
revisit
o
nice
american
take
on
the
style
easy
to
drink
but
i
never
really
see
it
around
could
drink
67
of
these
with
the
low
abv
o
a
very
enjoyable
offering
refreshing
and
easy
to
enjoy
if
you
enjoy
weyerbachers
blanche
youll
enjoy
this
offering
too
this
beer
has
changed
names
at
least
twice
and
im
hoping
it
is
going
to
stay
with
what
they
have
it
named
now
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
hazy
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
strong
head
on
top
the
smell
is
like
a
mix
between
and
belgian
triple
and
a
german
wheat
beer
with
some
hops
mixed
in
the
beer
tastes
pretty
refreshing
the
flavors
are
of
clove
wheat
bread
spicy
hops
and
some
soft
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
and
keep
this
beer
alive
a
very
good
beer
glad
they
brought
this
one
back
after
the
trademark
dispute
a
very
good
beer
that
is
well
balanced
between
spicy
hoppy
and
sweet
overall
an
odd
beer
nothing
too
special
the
pepper
and
spice
really
throw
this
beer
off
from
making
it
something
i
may
actually
like
not
really
for
me
this
is
a
very
crisp
slight
bitter
refreshing
beer
it
is
a
little
prickly
from
the
high
carbonation
pour
yields
a
light
coppercolored
brew
very
very
short
white
head
without
much
retention
nothing
else
comes
of
the
foam
other
than
a
very
thin
collar
the
nose
brings
some
light
clove
character
along
with
a
bit
of
breadcrust
malt
the
taste
falls
through
with
many
of
the
same
characteristics
and
then
hit
a
bit
of
bitterness
toward
the
end
and
in
the
finish
fairly
plain
other
than
the
clove
character
bit
of
light
floral
hops
the
feel
is
light
and
undercarbonated
slight
bitterness
again
in
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
drinkability
is
decent
though
nothing
too
special
here
12
oz
bottle
conditioned
with
no
freshness
date
pours
golden
amber
fairly
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
builds
up
a
two
finger
froth
the
head
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
leaves
nice
lacing
and
the
body
loses
carbonation
rather
quickly
in
the
nose
light
malt
and
spicy
hops
yield
to
fruityphenolic
yeast
tastes
of
toasted
malts
spicymedicinal
yeast
and
a
firm
bitterness
from
the
greenspicy
hops
it
has
a
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
quickly
ebbs
and
a
lingering
bitterness
they
call
this
a
belgian
pale
but
it
almost
tastes
more
like
a
saison
either
way
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
brew
that
is
wellbalanced
and
definitely
worth
a
revisit
an
impressive
offering
from
weyerbacher
d
forgettable
worth
a
try
nice
as
an
extra
d
unusual
blend
of
hop
bitterness
and
spicy
yeast
characteristics
make
this
a
difficult
beer
for
me
to
drink
i
cant
appreciate
the
combination
overall
reasonably
nice
flavors
but
booze
heat
and
really
high
carbonation
detract
here
d
ontap
at
the
hulmeville
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
thick
off
white
colored
heading
lacing
left
throughout
the
tasting
mostly
toasted
malts
with
heavy
bread
and
an
awesome
spice
of
clove
and
a
touch
of
honey
a
solid
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
great
tingly
bubbly
action
on
the
tongue
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
pale
ales
but
this
one
saat
very
well
with
me
d
although
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
did
get
it
through
a
trade
so
i
dont
see
the
likelyhood
of
having
this
beer
again
or
not
for
a
very
long
time
if
offered
the
opportunity
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
again
drinkability
a
little
too
much
phenol
character
for
my
palate
but
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
for
a
domestic
brewer
and
one
that
verges
on
belgian
ipa
territory
good
enough
to
continue
withat
least
until
the
growler
runs
out
good
beer
that
is
just
a
bit
too
hot
i
did
not
check
my
4
pack
of
heresy
closely
and
a
single
of
this
beer
was
a
stowaway
someone
switched
out
a
bottle
at
the
store
ok
another
beer
to
try
its
pretty
good
not
really
belgian
tasting
i
suppose
the
black
pepper
finish
gives
a
hint
o
belgian
but
it
was
hoppier
than
id
expect
a
belgian
pale
to
be
pretty
good
very
drinkable
nothing
too
extreme
in
any
direction
not
very
memorable
but
would
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
i
bought
a
whole
case
of
this
stuff
back
in
aug
really
good
up
until
oct
not
impressed
with
the
aging
of
this
below
average
belgian
pale
ale
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
hung
on
for
awhile
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
quite
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
aroma
earthy
and
herbal
nice
yeast
qualities
give
some
spice
pale
malt
lends
some
breadyness
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
bordering
on
belgian
ipa
territory
with
the
hop
presence
more
bitter
than
sweet
hints
of
grass
yeast
spice
with
a
slight
herbal
medicinal
finish
lighter
body
with
lively
carbonation
that
makes
the
flavors
really
pop
not
harsh
at
all
a
different
take
on
the
style
with
a
bit
of
the
weyerbacher
charactor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
verboten
is
highly
drinkable
and
the
relatively
low
abv
only
adds
to
its
tendency
to
have
another
one
right
away
i
went
through
this
6pack
in
less
than
a
week
ill
get
this
one
again
real
soon
kudos
to
the
wonderful
brewers

enough
its
smooth

enjoyable
not
a
bad
overall
brew
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
this
is
a
good
combination
of
the
hoppy
crispness
of
a
pale
ale
with
the
complex
funk
of
the
belgians
very
drinkable
as
a
beer
to
savor
slowly
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
are
great
and
all
the
senses
are
excited
when
drinking
it
but
it
kind
of
tastes
muddled
as
it
warms
and
isnt
dry
enough
to
erase
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
after
drinking
most
of
the
bottle
d
it
is
usually
tough
to
expect
much
from
american
breweries
when
it
comes
to
belgian
styles
except
for
ommegang
and
russian
river
but
this
is
way
up
there
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
by
itself
but
pair
it
with
a
beef
stew
or
something
as
robust
in
flavor
drinkability
im
in
love
with
this
beer
lowish
alcohol
lotsa
hops
and
interesting
belgian
yeast
characteristics
make
a
great
drinkable
beer
d
good
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
weyerbacher
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again

for
a
standard

is
very
bitter

funky

it
is

i
think
the

which
maintains

aroma
is
simple
enough
but
enticing
with
citrusaroma

sweetness
of
pears
and
spices
with
bitter

finish
a
little
too
hoppy
given
its
otherwise
delicate
flavors
well
carbonated
and
smooth
except
for
a
little
puckering
due
to
slightly
excessive
hopping
not
quite
pale
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
smooth

a

notes
middle
of
the
road
for
me
granted
that
i
typically
am
not
too
fond
of
the
style
and
this
falls
on
the
low
end
of
that
spectrum
for
me
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
very
good
drinkable
pale
featuring
some
good
subtle
funk
reminds
me
of
west
flanders
single
from
some
place
or
another
d
stylistically
satisfactory
and
on
point
despite
the
creative
liscense
and
liberties
taken
by
the
brewer
a
valliant
effort
but
well
short
of
extraordinary
d
really
nice
drinkability
on
this
one
the
missus
and
i
blew
through
the
sixer
this
is
a
style
thats
growing
on
me
more
and
more
and
this
weyerbacher
brew
is
near
the
top
of
the
heap
solid
offering
overall
i
would
happy
to
drink
this
if
some
one
offered
it
to
me
or
if
i
found
it
on
tap
but
i
wont
be
asking
russ
to
send
me
another
bottle
light
wispy

bready
taste
with
a
hint
of
orange
peels
and
berries
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
bubbling
on
the
palate
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
spring
or
winter
day
f
it
finishes
a
little
sweet
and
bitter
and
lingers
makes
you
smack
your
mouth
a
little
not
bad
but
could
be
better
i
think
the
two
main
flavors
belgian
malts
and
hops
seem
to
clash
not
enough
belgian
and
too
much
hops
imho
i
will
want
to
drink
more
of
these
d
extremely
drinkable
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
another
6
pack
of
these

this
is
a
very
enjoyable

to
wrap
up
a
hot
summer
day
moreys
bottom
line
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
tasty
that
being
said
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
little
better
not
disappointed
but
not
wowed
either
d
i
enjoyed
this
after
a
nice
jog
it
went
down
rather
easily
but
maybe
belgian
pale
ales
arent
my
thing
i
dont
know
if
they
changed
the
recipe
from
zotten
or
not
but
i
remember
i
really
enjoyed
zotten
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer

finish
things
off
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
an
activeish
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
a
very
nice
bpa
though
the
hops
and
spices
dont
seem
to
get
along
all
too
well
deciding
instead
to
clash
beyond
that
though
a
solid
offering
as
a
critique
of
the
style
this
is
better
than
weaker
wheat
styles
it
is
a
better
belgian
style
for
me
than
others
pours
a
a
nice
golden
peach
color
with
a
staying
1
finger
head
clinging
lacing
on
side
of
glass
smell
is
musty
with
yeast
and
fruit
along
with
some
hops
citrus
lemon
and
pepper
taste
was
better
then
smell
first
up
was
some
musty
grassy
hops
followed
by
yeast
and
fruit
like
apples
and
pears
throw
in
some
clove
a
little
citrus
peel
and
som
spices
its
very
smooth
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
velvety
with
sweetness
on
the
front
and
some
bitterness
in
the
back
its
well
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
ill
buy
it
again
and
recommend
it
drinkability
was
really
bad
this
was
damn
near
a
drain
pour
i
was
seriously
tempted
i
really
was
but
i
hate
to
waste
beer
even
bad
beer
fortunately
i
can
down
a
pint
in
less
than
two
seconds
if
i
need
to
with
this
one
i
needed
to
d
very
refreshing
beer
great
citrus
notes
for
a
bpa
two
of
these
would
certainly
be
in
order
for
a
hot
day
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
pepper
lemon
rind
orange
leather
and
earth
this
aroma
has
some
nice
complexity
the
taste
has
more
barnyard
qualities
to
it
than
the
aroma
does
there
is
some
hay
horse
blanket
lemon
pepper
and
a
hint
of
orange
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
high
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
i
normally
tire
of
64oz
of
the
same
beer
after
a
while
but
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
this
growler
off
the
low
alcohol
kept
me
in
check
and
the
flavor
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
this
is
very
drinkable
and
than
some
great
beer
here
i
could
really
enjoy
this
with
some
barbequed
chicken
ribs
or
steak
d
solid
good
all
around
there
are
better
bpas
but
this
one
runs
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
style
abv
keeps
it
pretty
drinkable
though
the
hops
could
wear
after
a
couple
not
bad
at
all
d
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
americanmade
version
of
a
belgian
beer
drinkable
o
this
is
just
a
wonderful
beer
the
hop
dominant
balance
hits
perfectly
in
that
high
hop
beer
area
without
being
ridiculously
hoppy
i
love
the
high
hop
beers
but
when
i
want
more
than
one
ill
be
reaching
for
the
weyerbacher
definitely
do
not
miss
this
beer
weyerbacher
verboten
is
an
incredibly
lively
hazy
golden
ale
with
a
huge
dense
soft
pillowy
white
head
that
seems
permanent
it
has
a
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
with
notes
of
clove
nutmeg
banana
pear
and
apple
its
pretty
light
bodied
very
lively
and
quite
smooth
it
has
a
pretty
clean
finish
it
tastes
fruity
estery
and
a
bit
phenolic
a
leafy
wooden
bitterness
zips
up
the
finish
theres
kind
of
an
apple
pie
flavor
in
here
its
pretty
complex
but
its
not
challenging
this
is
drinkable
enough
to
be
a
session
ale
this
is
a
bit
strong
in
mouthfeel
and
abv
but
its
not
terribly
present
while
id
prefer
to
have
one
of
these
beers
thats
been
imported
weyerbachers
done
a
decent
job
with
this
and
for
a
warm
summer
night
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
flavor
in
this
but
at
the
same
time
this
didnt
call
for
any
food
or
drink
to
accompany
it
worth
a
shot
once
if
youre
into
this
style
of
beer
dthis
beer
is
just
off
plain
and
simple
extremely
phenolic
and
soapy
which
i
am
not
a
fan
of
at
all
poured
a
reddish
orange
with
a
dense
head
that
thinned
fairly
quickly
very
sweet
belgian
malt
aroma
with
citrusy
orange
character
and
a
hint
of
hop
character
as
well
nice
smooth
feel
very
pleasant
carbonation
starts
with
a
citrusy
orange
flavors
followed
by
a
the
smooth
pale
malty
character
finishes
with
a
nice
hoppymalty
balance
nice
balance
to
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
overall
i
found
that
this
beer
is
for
once
a
belgian
mixed
style
that
is
actually
what
it
is
described
to
be
such
as
belgian
ipa
belgian
iipa
belgian
insert
some
style
here
this
beer
lives
up
to
be
a
belgian
pale
ale
youve
got
a
great
belgian
nose
but
the
hops
and
malt
to
back
up
the
pale
moniker
no
recommendations
other
than
to
try
and
have
the
head
on
this
beer
last
a
bit
longer
minor
appearance
defect
great
job
on
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
smooth
and
sugary
impression
another
fine
brew
in
a
style
thats
tough
to
do
well
by
weyerbacher
the
brewery
that
flinches
not
d
got
through
the
12
oz
bottle
okay
was
easy
enough
to
do
but
i
would
notn
call
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
served
from
tap
into
a
tulip
pours
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsides
to
one
finger
maintains
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
bananas
wheat
and
malt
the
flavor
was
of
bread
bananas
apple
and
malt
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
and
smooth
brew
the
fruity
flavor
is
obvious
throughout
but
is
not
overwhelming
and
made
it
quite
refreshing
i
will
definitely
be
buying
and
drinking
some
more
of
this
in
the
future
notes
glad
that
i
found
this
interesting
offering
from
weyerbacher
at
saveon
d
a
decent
belgian
ale
there
was
a
nice
smell
but
a
slightly
metallic
taste
which
was
offputting
and
the
carbonation
was
too
high
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
drinkability
this
has
many
qualities
to
make
it
pretty
drinkable
theres
the
lowish
abv
a
reasonable
take
on
the
bpa
style
fairly
inexpensive
and
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
drinkability
this
is
a
very
sessionable
belgian
pale
ale
quite
enjoyable
and
wont
dissapoint
those
looking
for
a
hoppier
example
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
brew
not
remarkable
but
at
the
same
time
i
dont
find
myself
regretting
buying
or
drinking
it
mfd
decent
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
smooth
and
inviting
residual
sweetness
and
a
lingering
spearmint
flavor
d
the
injection
of
hops
seems
to
drown
out
the
rest
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
a
beer
that
has
potential
an
interesting
take
on
bpas
but
a
traditionalist
might
not
find
it
as
such
drinkabilitywise
my
palate
would
be
tired
and
confused
after
two
or
three
worth
a
try
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
a
nice
belgian
pale
with
higher
bitterness
not
bad
d
this
beer
displays
a
lot
of
promise
in
the
aroma
but
ultimately
fails
to
deliver
on
it
there
is
a
lot
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
as
well
as
a
huge
medicinal
clove
note
while
there
are
some
of
the
vanilla
and
soft
fruit
notes
that
would
be
more
appropriate
to
the
style
they
are
ground
down
under
the
assault
of
the
other
yeast
flavors
the
hops
are
also
a
bit
blunt
there
is
a
nice
herbal
note
in
the
aroma
and
a
similar
character
shows
up
in
the
flavor
the
bitterness
is
excessive
and
exhibits
a
harshness
that
is
amplified
by
the
medicinal
clove
overall
the
beer
looks
good
and
smells
nice
but
totally
comes
apart
in
the
flavor
ill
finish
this
one
but
i
wont
be
drinking
it
again
d
superbly
drinkable
sweet
and
interesting
with
a
decent
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
the
zotten
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
almost
yellow
color
a
thin
head
quickly
fades
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
and
sweet
malts
some
citrus
fruits
and
caramel
are
also
present
taste
is
much
more
bitter
than
expected
with
some
sweetness
up
front
lemon
peels
and
malts
round
out
the
quaff
pretty
good
tasting
belgian
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
will
look
to
trade
for
more
in
the
future
when
it
is
under
the
new
name
thanks
again
arenbeer
ive
had
better
beers
from
weyerbacher
but
not
many
frankly
given
what
ive
had
from
them
in
the
past
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
they
could
make
a
beer
like
this
impressive
id
wish
only
that
all
this
flavor
could
be
achieved
in
a
slightly
lower
abv
to
make
it
truly
sessionable
still
it
is
a
great
drink
anytime
and
ill
have
to
stock
up
unless
they
take
this
guy
yearround
overall
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
delerium
noel
goblet
im
glad
i
was
able
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
discontinued
beer
on
the
shelves
at
rsvp
the
beer
has
a
golden
tan
color
it
is
extremely
clear
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
rising
there
is
a
big
white
foam
head
that
has
settled
down
to
a
finger
thick
layer
of
large
bubbles
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
and
plenty
of
visible
coating
left
behind
when
i
swirl
the
beer
around
it
has
a
great
sweet
malt
aroma
i
can
detect
figs
banana
and
toffee
it
reminds
me
of
a
strong
dubbel
i
could
smell
the
beer
a
little
bit
while
pouring
but
now
that
ive
really
taken
in
the
aroma
im
eager
to
take
a
sip
the
beer
has
a
big
malt
flavor
i
can
taste
graham
cracker
banana
alcohol
and
a
slight
astringency
in
the
finish
it
is
a
heavy
beer
with
lots
of
coating
properties
i
can
almost
swallow
a
second
time
after
i
use
my
tongue
to
collect
the
film
left
in
my
mouth
i
dont
consider
this
a
bad
trait
although
some
might
i
like
a
beer
with
a
strong
mouth
presence
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
looking
at
the
beer
made
me
expect
to
feel
more
bubbles
but
i
think
the
heavy
body
tempers
this
quality
somewhat
considering
the
heavy
body
and
abv
i
find
the
beer
to
be
pretty
drinkable
i
would
drink
a
number
in
fast
succession
but
i
can
certainly
see
myself
working
through
a
four
pack
in
an
evening
im
glad
this
beer
will
be
back
albeit
under
a
different
name
nice
enough
but
one
is
plenty
for
me
skål
overall
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
beer
while
doing
some
prep
work
for
a
nice
grilling
session
as
summer
approaches
and
i
get
the
desire
for
more
mellow
beers
instead
of
imperial
stouts
i
think
i
will
turn
to
some
belgian
style
ales
to
quench
my
thirst
na
zdravje
d
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
belgian
for
an
american
brewery
this
is
a
well
made
beer
d
its
just
average
this
was
ok
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
a
lot
of
alcohol
started
to
show
itself
much
more
than
i
would
have
thought
for
an
only
6
beer
the
heavy
combo
of
sweetness
spice
and
warmth
just
didnt
work
me
here
the
way
that
i
had
hoped
pours
a
dark
clear
orange
or
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
is
tight
and
perfumy
with
allspice
and
light
fruit
flavor
is
direct
and
clean
apricot
wheat
all
spice
with
a
sharp
nutty
bitterness
that
lies
across
a
surprisingly
broad
sweep
of
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
pleasant
but
relatively
flat
with
an
aspirinlike
quality
that
actually
accentuates
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
clingy
wow
randomly
bought
a
4
pack
of
this
on
a
early
spring
sunday
afternoon
from
shop
rite
liquors
in
oakland
nj
tremendous
selection
btw
and
am
loving
it
pours
a
sweet
light
orange
solid
head
great
texture
subtle
bite
mouthwatering
hops
and
amazing
finish
not
much
more
to
say
other
than
i
could
drink
this
stuff
forever
too
bad
its
been
discontinued
but
apparently
its
eventually
supposed
to
be
sold
under
a
different
name
so
dont
fret
if
you
get
a
chance
to
get
this
do
it
its
the
real
deal
nice
medium
orange
colour
with
a
white
moderately
dense
head
that
almost
comes
across
as
creamy
smell
is
grassy
outdoorsy
little
barn
funk
taste
is
malty
upfront
and
pleasantly
bitter
on
the
finish
pretty
solidly
crafted
belgian
pale
actually
mouthfeel
was
average
for
the
style
and
had
very
light
nearly
nonexistent
co2
very
drinkable
at
6
with
such
light
carbonation
d
very
good
glass
is
empty
fast
i
have
had
this
brew
since
before
weyerbacher
was
ordered
to
remove
it
from
based
on
a
legal
outcome
with
this
being
said
i
really
hope
that
they
do
rerelease
this
brew
again
and
from
what
i
have
read
it
sound
like
they
will
this
brew
was
poured
into
a
chalice
had
a
nice
dull
golden
color
somewhat
cloudy
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
had
great
retention
the
bubbles
in
the
head
where
reminiscent
of
champagne
and
i
think
this
is
what
lead
to
the
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
pale
malt
with
a
nice
clove
and
slight
banana
scent
some
additional
fruit
aromas
green
apple
hops
are
there
and
mix
very
well
the
malt
flavor
comes
across
first
and
then
the
hop
presence
sets
in
and
seems
to
mix
well
with
the
carbonation
as
it
hits
the
side
and
back
of
the
tongue
hopes
have
a
nice
bitterness
and
are
much
more
pronounced
here
than
in
the
nose
flavors
of
clove
and
banana
from
the
yeast
are
there
and
go
very
well
with
everything
love
to
find
out
what
hops
they
have
used
in
this
one
again
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
really
hope
and
look
forward
to
seeing
it
out
in
the
market
renamed
in
the
future
pours
a
bright
orange
brown
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
several
shades
darker
than
your
typical
bpa
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
there
is
banana
apple
juicyfruit
that
goes
along
with
some
yeasty
phenols
clove
spot
on
for
a
bpa
the
taste
is
more
subdued
and
has
more
of
a
hoppy
presence
while
still
sweet
it
is
more
balanced
against
the
bitter
hops
there
is
still
some
yeasty
flavors
like
banana
and
clove
that
remind
you
that
this
is
a
belgian
style
brew
but
some
hop
presence
that
tell
you
that
it
was
american
made
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
fizzy
and
crisp
finishes
slightly
bitter
an
enjoyable
bpa
a
little
off
for
the
style
but
well
made
overall
my
first
good
impression
of
weyerbacher
drinkability
is
definitely
high
abv
is
low
enough
to
enjoy
alone
and
it
pairs
nicely
with
food
d
a
well
crafted
brew
i
would
definitely
drink
another
and
another
pours
from
the
tap
to
a
brilliant
orangered
color
with
thick
off
white
head
tha
lingers
to
midglass
with
okay
lacing
nose
is
muted
but
what
is
there
is
not
the
hoppy
citrus
i
expect
from
an
ipa
but
does
have
the
bread
scents
of
a
good
pale
ale
mouthfeel
fairly
full
and
a
little
chewy
and
the
aste
pciks
up
the
bread
and
yeast
malts
of
the
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
finish
smooth
and
fairly
long
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
beer
that
kept
me
identifying
more
flavors
and
subtleties
as
i
drank
it
i
enjoyed
the
earthybready
character
to
the
citrus
bitterness
and
wish
that
balance
was
closer
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
as
a
diversion
from
a
typical
pale
ale
as
well
as
a
typical
belgian
if
one
can
say
typical
and
belgian
in
the
same
sentence
i
didnt
grade
it
as
high
as
some
primarily
because
of
the
bitter
bite
toward
the
end
of
each
sip
this
coming
from
someone
who
is
obsessed
with
ipas
weyerbacher
did
a
really
impressive
job
with
zotten
its
not
often
that
you
find
american
takes
on
belgian
styles
that
are
such
a
success
i
guess
this
one
deserves
a
bit
of
a
footnote
the
hoppy
flavor
is
very
american
but
adds
a
great
deal
to
the
overall
flavor
i
love
that
aspect
of
it
the
nose
could
use
a
little
more
muscle
and
the
more
body
would
help
but
those
are
small
gripes
zottens
a
fantastic
beer
thats
well
worth
a
purchase
d
light
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
the
coarseness
and
carbonation
is
a
little
hard
to
take
at
times
as
said
before
finishes
very
clean
and
thats
a
nice
touch
for
a
complex
brew
like
this
enjoyable
and
def
would
try
it
again
zotten
was
a
hazy
amber
in
color
that
had
a
one
finger
off
white
head
and
quickly
dissipated
to
a
collar
it
had
a
spicy
fruity
aroma
and
tasted
like
zesty
pears
speaking
of
zest
zotten
seemed
to
have
a
slightly
soapy
note
to
the
tongue
not
really
displeasing
though
this
beer
was
medium
bodied
and
had
plenty
of
carbonation
reasonably
good
drinkability
not
my
favorite
bspa
but
a
good
one
besides
i
tend
to
prefer
the
bsdas
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
hops
with
some
nice
light
fruity
ester
and
some
grain
is
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
a
very
nice
mix
between
some
cereal
and
dry
hops
with
a
light
fruity
touch
in
the
finish
i
very
much
appreciated
the
hops
presence
and
this
was
somewhat
reminiscent
of
ddc
dernière
volonté
thought
a
notch
below
overall
excellent
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
just
yet
and
this
one
is
certainly
good
enough
to
keep
me
interested
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
spice
content
wasnt
overdone
and
that
this
was
a
decent
beer
overall
fairly
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
overall
not
bad
id
probably
reach
for
this
in
the
summertime
or
use
it
as
a
gateway
beer
for
nonbeer
geek
friends
wow
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
ideas
in
beer
history
trying
to
cross
a
pale
ale
with
a
belgian
and
what
you
got
is
something
that
is
a
distant
cousin
to
both
instead
of
leveraging
the
styles
strengths
this
beer
doubles
down
on
their
worst
attributes
an
aroma
that
is
pungent
a
color
taht
is
cloudy
a
very
hoppy
tatse
that
fights
like
a
strong
ale
not
a
fun
beer
and
a
true
shame
that
it
might
discredit
weyerbachers
other
great
beers
this
actually
outclasses
bruges
zot
which
i
found
overrated
but
which
is
of
the
same
style
and
shares
a
conceptual
link
it
may
not
outclass
all
authentic
belgians
in
the
style
but
it
can
sure
hold
its
own
another
weyerbacher
winner
pretty
aggresively
hopped
for
a
belgian

theres
a

the
tradeoff

is
that
its

leaves
it
just

the

sips
were
just

the

more

came
out

out
every
one
of
their
new
releases
this
beer
reminded
us
of
just
how
incredible
they
are
as
premier
brewers
the
base
beer
is
full
warming
and
hearty
but
what
makes
it
fantastic
is
the
thick
layer
of
oily
organic
hoppiness
that
they
float
overtop
of
it
the
interplay
between
the
decidedly
belgian
malt
bill
and
yeasty
zest
with
the
fresh
floral
and
bitterly
soapy
hoppiness
is
both
highly
enjoyable
and
thoroughly
refreshing
this
was
the
best
beer
of
a
long
night
of
tasting
and
something
we
hope
they
will
continue
to
stock
this
is
ommegangs
most
memorable
in
recent
memory
and
should
encourage
them
to
keep
their
hop
game
evolving
beer
pours
a
light
orange
copper
color
clear
but
you
can
see
little
floaties
in
the
beer
finger
of
head
looks
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
in
the
glass
smells
of
strong
citrus
and
grapefruit
peel
definitely
smells
dryhopped
and
lives
up
to
the
hop
house
name
the
taste
is
a
solid
belgian
pale
with
a
nice
yeasty
spice
and
a
strong
hop
character
tropical
and
citrus
notes
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
really
great
brew
and
a
bit
different
from
the
rest
of
ommegangs
lineup
definitely
has
the
core
of
a
belgian
ale
with
the
american
hoppyness
and
i
really
like
it
it
is
exactly
what
it
claims
to
be
and
i
have
to
give
props
for
that
i
would
classify
this
more
as
an
ipa
than
pale
ale
however
overall
a
pretty
tasty
belgian
dry
hoped
pale
ale
overall
with
a
bit
more
spice
bite
then
the
norm
and
that
is
on
the
crisper
and
side
a
pretty
good
one
to
at
least
try
o
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
not
overbearing
in
any
way
and
very
smooth
and
drinkable
o
like
this
one
a
lot
good
crisp
beer
for
a
hot
day
would
revisit
best
ommegang
i
have
had
i
hate
to
do
this
because
ommegang
is
fairly
local
to
me
and
i
am
a
big
fan
of
many
of
their
beers
but
this
isnt
one
of
those
just
plain
boring
bitterness
not
balanced
well
and
the
high
hop
content
doesnt
really
mesh
well
with
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
i
honestly
took
two
sips
and
poured
it
out
when
ommegang
focused
on
a
few
solid
beers
they
were
untouchable
but
now
they
are
trying
to
be
all
things
to
all
people
and
i
think
their
products
are
suffering
im
sure
they
dont
want
to
brew
hennepin
or
rare
vos
all
day
every
day
but
the
difference
with
those
beers
and
this
one
is
they
are
delicious
a
pleasant
pale
ale
somewhat
atypical
because
of
the
dryness
the
aroma
appearance
and
palate
are
all
good
but
the
monoflavor
becomes
rapidly
boring
bottle
poured
a
hazy
dirty
yellowbeige
color
ale
with
a
relatively
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing

of
dry
floral
hoppy
notes
with
light
rustic
malt
notes
also
perceptible
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
floral
hoppy
notes
with
some
rustic
malt
and
some
bitter
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
i
actually
quite
enjoyed
the
mix
between
the
belgian
ale
notes
and
the
hoppy
notes
i
need
to
try
this
from
a
bottle
as
i
cant
imagine
ommegang
would
put
out
a
beer
this
bad
and
lacking
any
true
flavor
o
this
offering
by
ommegang
stands
out
as
one
of
their
best
imo
it
nails
that
belgian
richness
of
flavor
and
aroma
while
being
accentuated
by
the
increase
in
hops
great
stuff
if
it
were
a
tad
higher
in
alcohol
the
beer
would
easily
meet
the
criteria
for
belgian
ipa
it
probably
does
already
but
with
its
slight
strength
the
beer
delivers
high
complexity
but
in
effortless
sessionability
another
really
nice
wellbalanced
beer
from

is

if

as

but
was
hoping
for
more
inyourface
hoppyness
not
sure
how
old
this
is
no
discernible
dating
code
on
the
bottle
i
can
see
i
have
seen
this
many
times
but
never
gotten
despite
normally
being
a
fan
of
ommegang
finally
picked
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed

from
ye
old
excellent
looking
beer
cloudy
with
a
great
head
that
stuck
around
and
grabbed
the
glass
smell
was
outstanding
but
no
overly
strong
mixed
feelings
about
the
taste
did
not
have
the
bang
of
an
ipa
but
smooth
and
drinkable
without
the
overwhelming
bitter
aftertaste
that
can
turn
me
off
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
very
much
but
not
enough
to
buy
regularly
unless
i
could
find
it
at
a
good
cost
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
different
take
on
the
bpa
and
certainly
wont
appeal
to
everyone
nonetheless
a
pretty
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
belgian
pale
you
can
tell
this
is
a
clone
if
true
belgian
ale
it
has
a
distinguished
taste
and
follow
through
overall
great
pay
attention
to
ommegang
oa
the

flavors
are
there
but
never

like
this

a
great

someday
ill
have
to
try
it
sidebyside
with
fleur

houblon
which
i
loved
overall
underwhelmed
by
this
one
very
basic
belgium
pale
ale
no
special
flavors
or
twist
on
the
style
flavor
is
bland
and
this
isnt
even
a
good
take
on
the
style
nothing
special
here
or
anything
i
want
to
try
again
a
decent
nose
on
this
ale
prevailing
with
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
the
belgian
derived
esters
the
palate
comes
across
as
dry
but
smooths
out
with
an
initial
hop
bitterness
and
clean
crisp
flavors
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
hints
of
pine
subtle
resin
and
mint
finishing
with
citrus
are
present
in
the
lingering
afterpalate
a
pleasant
drinker
pours
out
an
apricot
body
with
a
bit
of
haze
head
starts
off
huge
but
dies
down
strong
earthy
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
with
light
yeast
esters
and
grain
body
i
get
a
whiff
of
brett
possibly
flavor
has
some
bready
maltiness
and
toasty
grains
up
front
the
hops
come
in
full
force
with
longlasting
bitterness
hops
bring
some
herbal
and
grassy
flavors
overall
more
bitter
than
aromatic
body
is
moderate
with
lively
carbonation
i
would
kind
of
like
this
to
be
lighter
on
the
tongue
solid
beer
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
some
of
the
great
hoppy
belgians
kind
of
an
odd
one
here
definitely
belgian
in
character
but
the
hops
are
kicking
in
on
this
seems
quite
earthy
overall
with
that
almost
clay
tone
i
pick
up
off
some
of
these
hopped
belgian
ales
could
really
stand
some
smoothing
out
but
its
a
nice
enough
drinker
always
fine
with
trying
something
from
ommegang
i
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
here
either
and
i
only
felt
it
once
i
finished
off
this
bottle
if
it
were
possible
to
create
a
new
style
of
beer
that
combined
the
taste
of
a
bpa
with
the
strength
and
more
aggressive
hops
of
an
american
counterpart
this
would
be
a
good
start
not
strong
overly
bitter
or
potent
this
beer
would
please
both
ommegang
fans
and
hopheads
alike
this
new
direction
on
a
standard
was
worth
the
effort
o
bitterness
seems
out
of
place
with
hop
flavors
lacking
a
bit
beautiful
hazed
orange
apricot
appearance
glowing
in
my
glass
clouded
off
white
head
forming
thick
looks
like
a
dimpled
biscuit
sitting
afloat
on
the
body
of
this
beer

a

along

overall
i
cant
get
enough
of
a
well
crafted
easy
drinking
complex
ale
with
moderate

this
will
get
better
and
better
as
it

is
a
solid

beer
to

for
along
time
unmistakeable
belgian
character
from
the
yeast
blended
with
a
higher
hop
load
than
a
typical
belgian
ipa
but
lower
than
an
american
ipa
mildly
bitter
some
coffee
sneaks
in
the
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
an
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
pale
but
i
hope
the
rumors
arent
true
that
this
is
replacing
bpa
this
is
less
distinct
to
me
not
as
yeasty
and
farmy
more
in
line
with
convention
although
i
love
the
grassy
and
bitter
complex
of
the
hops
here
more
body
too
i
think
than
bpa
although
the
two
beers
are
cut
from
the
same
cloth
a
bit
more
of
a
copper
color
as
well
equally
pronounced
white
head
with
ring
lacing
more
grassy
than
floral
but
summery
in
nature
on
the
nose
some
wheat
malt
may
be
in
here
as
well
im
missing
yeasty
haze
and
although
this
beer
is
dry
and
has
a
very
recognizable
belgian
yeast
character
to
the
finish
it
simply
doesnt
stand
out
the
way
fresh
bpa
always
has
for
me
i
know
the
two
beers
are
minimally
different
but
i
prefer
the
original
overall
drinkability
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
very
well
done
and
if
there
was
a
such
thing
as
an
american
belgian
india
pale
ale
i
suspect
this
would
be
the
benchmark
for
the
style
it
definitely
has
aspects
of
a
belgian
pale
but
the
full
hop
flavor
is
all
aipa
dangerously
drinkable
wish
i
had
bought
a
six
pack
o
if
i
were
in
an
ipa
mood
or
an
abbey
ale
mood
i
wouldnt
go
for
hophouse
however
as
a
middleoftheroad
everyday
beer
its
a
tasty
and
unique
choice
nothing
earthshaking
but
more
enjoyable
than
your
average
fare
ill
likely
buy
again

matt
for

this

exactly
what
i
want
in
a
belgian

arent
overpowering

just
destroy

think
people
completely
miss
the
point
of
a
belgian
pale
and
expect
it
to
be
an
american
pale
like
flying
dog
raging
bitch
which
is
just
an
american
ipa
as
there
is
no
belgian
note
at
all
in
it

continue
to
love
what

doing

i
can

it

released

smell
was
hoppier
than
any
other
ommegang
beer
i
recall
having
but
not
quite
hopped
up
enough
to
be
in
ipa
territory
there
was
a
distinct
yeast
presence
evident
in
the
smell
and
it
was
cleared
in
the
taste
in
the
form
of
banana
and
white
pepper
the
hops
were
there
in
the
taste
but
more
like
a
spice
than
a
dominating
element
the
body
was
however
a
lot
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
as
the
hop
flavors
seemed
fleeting
due
to
it
what
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
was
candi
sugar
and
more
of
the
yeast
drawing
properly
from
the
belgian
tradition
and
american
adventurousness
although
its
a
lot
closer
to
the
belgian
roots
than
others
that
have
ventured
this
way
this
is
a
clear
golden
brew
the
tall
white
head
is
brilliant
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
clean
there
is
a
bit
of
a
belgian
yeast
scent
but
not
a
lot
of
fruit
scents
the
taste
is
drying
with
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
clean
and
fairly
quick
finish
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
glad
i
tried
this
but
probably
would
not
recommend
this
unless
it
is
something
you
need
to
try
it
is
okay
but
has
some
things
i
would
change
to
make
it
more
drinkable
o
its
a
good
enough
beer
but
id
like
some
more
hop
character
this
comes
out
with
bitterness
a
swinging
but
not
lot
of
flavor
from
the
hops
and
i
dont
know
if
the
base
beer
is
solid
enough
by
itself
overall
sort
of
a
belgian
ipa
but
more
like
a
hoppy
saison
i
have
had
a
couple
of
attempts
at
hoppy
saisons
before
and
while
tasty
they
were
a
little
muddled
and
confused
this
is
not
this
is
superb
and
underrated
on
this
site
imo
o
this
brew
has
traits
of
both
a
bipa
and
a
saison
a
good
beer
either
way
you
look
at
it
man
i
absolutely
love
ommegangs
beers
they
truly
believe
in
making
a
worldclass
belgian
here
in
the
u
s
and
it
shows
if
youve
read
any
of
my
other
reviews
youll
notice
that
im
not
a
fan
of
hopbased
brews
this
unfortunately
is
a
brew
designed
to
accommodate
the
hopheads
in
america
i
bought
one
solely
on
the
fact
that
ommegang
made
it
while
i
believe
that
ommegang
can
do
no
wrong
i
will
quietly
disregard
this
beer
as
an
attempt
to
satisfy
the
misguided
american
palate
which
seems
to
believe
that
beer
begins
and
ends
with
the
advent
of
the
ipa
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
good
mix
of
belgian
yeast
and
lush
hop
flavors
poured
to
a
sam
adams
glass
with
a
nice
full
and
thick
head
developing
tan
with
good
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
a
hazy
with
a
golden
color
aroma
had
strong
notes
of
citrus
yeast
and
some
floral
accents
tasted
floral
and
grassy
with
some
hop
notes
medium
bubbly
mouth
feel
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
almost
metallic
this
belgian
pale
ale
shows
a
nice
clear
amber
gold
with
a
muscular
snow
white
head
and
lots
of
puffy
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
clean
grassy
wheat
hop
that
is
very
refreshing
and
hits
a
definitive
floral
quality
as
well
delicate
but
sure
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
crisp
grass
but
a
gentle
floral
sweetness
to
balance
this
into
something
much
more
commendable
than
the
previous
reviews
generally
recognize
its
pretty
simple
but
i
love
it
born
to
be
served
cold
and
probably
best
enjoyed
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
months
this
brew
captures
some
bready
grain
with
tasteful
hops
that
will
clearly
satisfy
the
hop
cravings
of
most
hop
heads
like
me
the
body
is
pretty
much
light
but
it
delivers
a
high
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
crisp
feel
i
really
like
this
concoction
and
hope
it
will
be
available
during
the
summer
months
ahead
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
hoppy
belgian
style
pale
ale
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
when
it
came
to
the
aroma
but
when
i
got
to
the
taste
i
found
it
to
not
be
as
bright
and
vibrant
as
the
aroma
was
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
a
little
refreshing
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
might
want
to
switch
it
up
after
that
and
i
think
it
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
spring
time
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
very
nice
and
i
liked
how
fruity
and
vibrant
it
was
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
that
the
taste
wasnt
more
like
the
aroma
it
just
seemed
a
little
too
light
and
dull
after
that
really
nice
aroma
i
might
buy
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
but
im
not
in
any
hurry
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
hoppy
belgian
style
pale
ales
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
had
that
special
something
to
set
it
apart
and
make
it
really
memorable
i
like
the
idea
of
a
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
and
i
think
that
the
citrus
hops
can
work
really
nice
with
the
belgian
yeast
this
isnt
my
favorite
ommegang
beer
and
its
not
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
nice
work
guys
this
beer
was
pretty
solid
keep
it
up
poured
into
a
chuckanut
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
hops
mixed
citrus
juice
and
tropical
fruit
bready
malt
and
hints
of
belgian
spicing
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
citrus
hops
light
stone
and
tropical
fruit
light
belgian
yeast
and
spicing
medium
bodied
an
interesting
belgian
american
hybrid
with
the
hoppy
pale
ale
taking
the
forefront
but
with
nice
belgian
yeast
character
in
the
background
an
interesting
converse
of
a
belgian
ipa
with
the
belgian
character
at
the
fore
there
is
an
interesting
earthy
peppery
flavor
in
the
finish
that
is
probably
clove
interacting
with
the
hops
a
very
nicely
made
pale
ale
with
interesting
flavors
from
both
inspiring
styles
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
o
a
little
more
bold
bitter
and
rough
than
fleur
de
houblon
and
a
little
bigger
all
around
too
the
label
offers
a
smattering
of
pairing
suggestions
including
pizza
and
burgers
i
disagree
this
is
not
a
pizza
or
burger
beer
at
least
not
under
normal
circumstances
some
sort
of
creative
artisan
pizza
or
burger
maybe
i
can
see
it
meshing
well
with
an
arugula
laden
salad
i
have
to
rate
this
beer
based
on
my
preferences
while
others
may
like
this
one
i
found
it
to
be
horrendous
i
couldnt
even
choke
it
down
the
aroma
was
actually
pretty
good
but
when
i
got
the
first
sip
onto
my
palate
it
was
defintely
not
for
me
i
actually
picked
up
an
overwhelming
taste
of
cloves
and
i
cannot
stand
cloves
it
was
such
an
overpowering
taste
that
i
had
to
give
it
away
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
cloves
stay
away
if
you
are
a
fan
of
cloves
you
might
really
enjoy
this
beer
clear
with
heavy
lacing
great
hops
citrus
peel
bitter
the
taste
is
engaging
and
interesting
citrus
heavy
with
good
carbonation
and
a
belgiany
finish
belgian
yeast
is
floral
spicy
and
vaguely
sweet
finish
is
clean
and
lightly
grainy
very
strong
effort
will
have
again
highly
recommended
pours
clear
yellowish
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
aroma
offers
some
cloves
from
the
spicy
belgian
yeast
some
citrus
and
its
rind
and
some
cracker
from
what
i
figure
comes
from
a
decent
dose
of
pilsner
malt
flavor
pretty
much
follows
suit
but
the
general
citrus
is
a
more
distinct
lemon
and
orange
i
found
a
crisp
light
active
mouthfeel
overall
nothing
innovative
or
unique
about
this
beer
just
a
very
nice
well
constructed
highly
drinkable
belgian
ipa
would
definitely
drink
again
i
dug
it
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
a
very
good
belgian
ipa
good
balance
between
the
hops
and
yeasty
phenols
it
could
be
a
touch
lighter
in
the
malt
o
a
great
overall

i
mean
generally
speaking
this
is
really
my
kind
of
beer
i
love
belgian
pale
ales
i
love
ommegang
and
i
love
deft
dryhopping
its
exceedingly
easy
to
drink
with
an
excellent
aroma
appearance
feel
and
very
good
flavor
but
it
feels
like
they
dialed
back
the
spice
and
yeast
character
of
bpa
and
emphasized
the
hop
notes
swapping
noble
hops
for
more
americanish
ones
either
way
i
really
do
dig
this
beer
now
i
just
want
to
try
it
supersuperfresh
andor
with
an
alternate
dryhop
regimen
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
i
once
made
and
some
of
the
hoppier
stillwater
offerings
the
yeast
seems
in
the
french
saison
range
but
not
quite
as
spicy
in
a
way
nice
with
a
cheese
plate
with
figs
wouldnt
be
bad
either
with
ny
style
pizza
or
a
good
burger
well
worth
a
try
if
ya
like
belgians
and
ya
like
a
well
hopped
pale
ale
with
a
nice
citric
and
yeasty
snap
to
it
ill
get
a
sixer
or
a
four
pack
boo
next
time
overall
as
ommegang
says
this
is
a
belgian
american
love
child
does
have
a
nice
bittering
flavor
that
sets
it
apart
from
other
belgian
pale
ales
on
the
market
this
pours
a
handsome
bright
yellow
with
an
amber
depth
hazy
and
has
plenty
of
yeast
floating
around
in
it
that
settle
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
luscious
thick
head
of
white
foam
that
is
slow
to
fall
and
leaves
fantastic
lace
nose
is
bright
and
fruity
tropical
pineapple
orange
and
lemon
citrus
peel
and
a
nice
little
bit
of
honey
to
sweeten
all
that
a
little
more
as
it
warms
a
some
spice
notes
come
out
on
the
nose
taste
is
dry
and
delicate
with
a
traditional
belgian
bearing
it
has
that
farmhouse
dryness
but
no
astringency
the
fruits
are
not
as
well
defined
on
the
palate
and
fall
back
to
an
overall
fruity
and
floral
character
with
a
good
spice
that
develops
later
in
the
drink
it
finishes
dry
and
palate
cleansing
with
a
nice
long
after
taste
and
a
surprising
bitter
the
bitter
on
this
while
it
wont
knock
you
down
is
surprisingly
strong
this
is
a
classic
belgian
style
pale
ale
and
the
dry
hopping
has
given
it
a
keen
lightness
bit
of
pepper
in
the
finish
too
very
good
id
recommend
for
anyone
who
likes
the
occasional
ipa
for
the
hoppy
taste
but
isnt

this
one
comes
across
as
done

all
i

6

abv
lovely
and
refreshing
overall
a
solid
beer
ommegang
beers
appear
to
scream
quality
this
is
a
beer
i
think
would
be
good
for
any
month
i
think
both
ipa
and
lager
lovers
would
find
this
beer
enjoyable
o
a
wellrounded
belgian
pale
that
has
a
pretty
big
hop
presence
ommegang
almost
never
disappoints
overall
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
more
subtle
creation
in
the
mouth
that
it
suggests
after
the
initial
sensory
experience
i
certainly
appreciate
the
craft
would
be
really
thrilled
if
the
flavor
profile
were
bolder
and
livelier
o
is
it
special
probably
not
to
most
but
for
me
this
is
a
real
gem
from
ommegang
we
live
in
a
world
where
hops
massive
amount
of
abv
and
huge
stouts
rule
every
inch
of
our
country
this
offers
something
everyone
can
enjoy
lighter
beer
drinkers
will
appreciate
its
generously
fruity
palate
there
is
some
hops
there
for
the
everyday
hop
head
the
belgo
freaks
get
a
traditional
belgian
style
all
the
while
those
looking
to
expand
their
hop
palate
will
find
this
a
great
beer
to
gradually
bring
you
to
those
gifted
places
all
in
all
bpa
is
a
fine
little
ale
and
a
part
of
the
ommegang
family
of
fine
american
belgian
ales
this
is
the
perfect
spring
time
beer
i
know
itll
be
in
my
fridge
when
we
start
seeing
green
in
nature
again
next
spring
the
bpa
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
robust
head
that
lingered
the
entire
sitting
the
taste
was
light
and
peppy
with
plenty
of
bright
carbonation
that
kept
it
easy
to
drink
the
hops
hit
my
tongue
first
with
citrusy
notes
and
the
belgian
yeast
flavors
of
cloves
lingered
on
my
palate
the
bpa
was
a
brilliantly
balanced
brew
that
kept
things
light
while
cleverly
concealing
its
complexities
o
not
the
most
complex
belgian
pale
out
there
but
its
charming
enough
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
as
an
introductory
beer
for
those
who
arent
familiar
with
the
style
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
i
tried
a
sampler
originally
at
an
oktoberfest
celebration
at
a
local
winery
liked
it
so
much
that
i
picked
up
a
bottle
it
was
caramel
colored
in
the
glass
very
rich
looking
with
a
fair
head
smelled
of
citrus
with
wheaty
overtones
very
smooth
taste
wheaty
but
not
too
bitter
my
only
complaint
was
that
at
the
final
few
sips
the
citrus
was
a
bit
too
much
great
beer
overall
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
beer
that
is
designed
to
be
restrained
yet
remains
interesting
none
of
the
flavors
jump
out
and
hit
you
over
the
head
but
there
is
enough
going
on
in
there
that
you
are
highly
motivated
to
finish
the
pint
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
have
ranked
it
among
my
favorites
for
the
style

refreshing
top
bpa
great
carbonation
overall
if
you
are
a
proponent
of
subtle
tasting
beers
this
is
for
you
there
are
so
many
faint
tastes
and
smells
that
youll
have
a
ball
detecting
them
all
day
personally
i
am
for
the
heavy
hitting
scents
that
are
obvious
but
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
a
supporter
of
ommegang
and
pale
ales
taste
lemon
peel
with
light
sweet
grainy
malt
light
pine
from
the
dry
hops
that
keeps
this
beer
very
dry
some
esters
and
spice
from
the
yeast
overall
i
thought
this
was
nice
belgian
pale
ale
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
but
it
had
a
couple
flaws
that
held
it
back
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
not
filling
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
the
carbonation
would
really
start
to
wear
one
me
if
i
had
more
than
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
i
thought
they
were
both
good
and
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
just
a
little
bland
and
it
didnt
really
live
up
to
the
good
aroma
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
pretty
pricey
and
theres
a
few
other
bpas
that
i
like
much
more
than
this
one
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
really
like
the
style
but
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
of
my
friends
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
for
sure
wasnt
on
the
same
level
as
some
of
the
better
ones
of
the
style
and
it
doesnt
come
close
to
being
as
good
as
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
orval
i
tend
to
prefer
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
slight
bit
of
funk
to
it
this
made
for
an
ok
first
impressing
of
ommegang
i
got
a
few
more
of
their
beers
to
try
so
i
can
get
familiar
with
them
but
so
far
im
not
really
impressed
but
we
will
see
how
i
feel
after
i
try
some
of
their
more
popular
beers
cool
that
it
tastes
like
it
came
straight
from
a
brewery
in
belgium
rather
than
a
north
american
brewery
adding
some
belgian
yeast
to
their
pa
the
head
is
huge
and
rocky
with
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
gold
colour
the
nose
is
pure
brewery
with
a
yeasty
tang
plus
the
hops
of
course
i
really
liked
the
way
the
beer
tastes
like
a
fresh
beer
straight
from
the
keg
all
yeasty
and
thick
in
the
mouthfeel
unlike
any
pale
ale
i
have
tried
at
times
it
feels
like
an
english
bitter
with
the
taste
of
the
hops
and
the
slightly
undercarbonated
mouthfeel
great
beer
o
pleasure
to
drink
would
be
happy
to
buy
more
of
these
either
at
the
bar
or
at
home
the
bpa
from
ommegang
was
terrific
the
pour
was
nice
and
has
an
orangeish
hue
to
it
there
was
a
nice
frothy
head
that
lingered
as
well
the
aroma
was
fruity
with
hits
of
citrus
and
light
hops
the
flavor
was
also
light
and
crisp
with
a
nice
minimal
hoppy
after
thought
o
solid
belgian
ale
great
flavors
and
aromas
pours
a
burnt
light
orange
hue
with
a
billowing
three
finger
head
full
of
tight
tiny
bubbles
and
lacing
wherever
its
been
and
the
smell
is
very
cascade
like
with
aromas
of
floral
hop
bouquets
and
light
citrus
intertwined
with
belgian
yeast
and
fruity
estersthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
yet
creamy
and
perfectly
carbonated
with
tastes
of
those
floral
bouquet
cascade
hops
which
are
quite
bitter
which
i
like
and
they
dominate
but
the
bready
malts
and
belgian
yeast
are
still
there
in
the
greatest
cameo
almost
tango
and
cash
like
and
yes
its
a
quaffable
drop
that
ill
be
going
back
for
more
of
cheers
o
meets
style
outside
of
the
smell
even
though
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
brew
i
am
not
sure
i
would
drink
again
because
nothing
stands
out
just
a
solid
and
sessionable
beer
not
sure
what
you
could
do
to
make
this
beer
better
rjt
m
clean
smooth
and
refreshing
nice
crisp
finish
invites
the
next
sip
very
good
the
alcohol
wasnt
that
discernible
either
until
i
had
pretty
much
finished
this
off
its
my
fault
that
i
ended
up
pouring
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
out
and
finishing
all
of
the
contents
off
this
was
just
as
good
as
i
anticipated
and
a
crisp
clean
beer
for
the
warm
weather
thats
finally
made
its
way
up
to
my
neck
of
the
woods
not
to
be
missed
by
anyone
who
appreciates
good
belgian
beer
regardless
of
its
origin
great
reinvention
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
or
palate
correcting
the
excess
sweetness
and
lack
of
bitterness
resulting
in
a
more
balanced
and
fun
beer
pours
a
finespun
hazy
gold
with
refined
foam
and
good
retention
the
nose
is
sour
lemon
with
a
little
funk
way
in
back
soft
creamy
head
banana
soft
fruits
spice
toffee
malt
sparkling
taste
very
dry
with
medium
carbonation
its
a
little
heavier
than
it
looks
the
alcohol
is
not
perfectly
hidden
but
darn
awful
close
its
a
pale
ale
so
the
sour
bite
from
the
hops
is
just
good
punctuation
in
an
over
sized
wine
glass
this
ale
has
graceful
poise
bravo
m
very
clean
smooth
and
refreshing
nice
crisp
feel
as
it
finishes
the
citrus
doesnt
hang
around
and
youre
ready
for
another
sip
in
a
few
seconds
very
good
overall
bottle
caught
my
interest
the
beer
kept
my
interest
will
try
it
again
omnegang
have
been
impressed
with
most
of
their
offerings
oa
good
pale
ale
nothing
exceptional
but
for
sure
one
id
buy
again
notes
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
were
just
too
subtle
i
feel
like
it
needed
more
in
your
face
features
overall
i
had
high
hopes
coming
into
this
beer
i
wasnt
bad
but
certainly
not
the
best
from
the
start
it
seemed
promising
from
an
impressive
pour
but
turned
out
to
be
just
mediocre
ommegang
is
an
impressive
brewery
but
this
beer
needs
a
little
more
work
if
they
decide
to
i
may
try
this
again
if
its
on
tap
i
wold
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
but
warn
them
not
to
be
fooled
by
the
impressive
body
cheers
solid
nothing
spectacular
or
wrong
with
this
beer
cant
fault
it
in
any
way
although
my
personal
taste
is
for
fuller
more
complex
belgians
murky
dark
golden
appearance
with
decent
head
darker
than
a
regular
pale
ale
citrus
hoppy
aroma
characteristic
of
regular
pale
ales
great
drinkability
combines
the
best
of
a
belgian
style
ale
with
the
best
of
a
pale
ale
creating
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
lighter
than
a
normal
pale
ale
while
retaining
its
classic
characteristics
amazing
overall
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
just
enough
complexity
to
be
interesting
but
not
overwhelming
a
very
nice
american
attempt
that
stacks
up
nicely
against
the
belgians
it
doesnt
quite
trump
them
but
its
still
a
great
brew
more
yeast
in
the
flavor
starts
with
a
mild
grainy
malt
flavor
but
ends
with
a
sizable
hop
bitterness
bite
the
body
is
on
the
full
side
but
the
carbonation
is
also
high
theres
also
some
tartness
to
the
flavor
oa
solid
belgian
pale
ale
with
good
drinkability
a
little
pricey
though
poured
for
a
bottle
into
a
tulip

with
excellent
retention
pale

color
stiff
foamy
peaks
slight
fruity
aroma
not
overpowering
though
pleasant
enough
tasting
somewhat
typical
for
a
pale
ale
mout
hfeel
is
a
little
too
rough
for
my
taste
very
pleasant
finish
though
a
very
good
beer
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
to
have
again
body
is
mediumlight
with
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
leading
to
a
consistently
fizzy
mouthfeel
that
gradually
becomes
foamy
across
the
palate
closes
semidry
with
little
residual
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
aaah
its
a
pale
ale
has
that
touch
of
british
brewing
with
belgian
yeast
funky
and
complex
decent
enough
though
not
my
first
choice
or
second
or
from
ommegang
while
it
is
not
what
i
imagined
for
this
beer
i
do
enjoy
a
bit
of
surprise
when
i
open
a
new
beer
definitely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
unfortunately
not
worth
the
big
price

a

overall
an
excellent
belgian
pale
and
one
i
should
have
discovered
long
ago
ive
passed
it
up
too
many
times
o
the
nose
was
disappointing
but
everything
else
about
this
beer
was
good
overall
im
no
fan
of
pale
ales
granted
i
havent
had
many
but
im
trying
to
branch
out
and
damn
this
is
a
good
one
its
those
belgians
man
they
can
make
any
style
better
poured
a
clear
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
and
some
dry
hoppy
notes
is
very
interesting
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
fruity
ester
with
a
semisweet
belgian
malt
base
as
well
as
some
dry
hoppy
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
o
what
puts
this
beyond
the
average
summertime
beer
is
its
ability
to
transport
its
drinker
from
cold
dreary
doldrums
to
a
grassy
field
during
a
warm
summers
day
in
upstate
ny
okay
that
was
really
damn
corny
but
this
beer
is
that
refreshing
it
makes
me
wish
it
wasnt
35
degrees
out
thats
for
sure
this
beer
has
a
classic
belgian
look
to
it
sparkly
gold
clear
and
bubbly
with
a
thick
frothy
head
smells
great
as
well
dried
apples
raisins
vanilla
essence
malts
and
some
floral
hops
taste
isnt
far
off
either
nice
well
balanced
blend
of
dried
fruit
hops
malt
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
peppery
floral
hops
are
there
but
dont
overpower
the
beer
its
got
that
great
belgian
finish
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
buttery
smooth
and
rich
medium
bodied
w
light
carbonation
very
nice
overall
a
solid
wellrounded
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
and
is
perfect
for
all
seasons
o
while
the
taste
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
hopping
for
the
aroma
blew
me
away
and
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
overall
i
picked
up
a
corked
bottle
for
about
6
and
it
was
definitely
worth
every
penny
so
from
me
to
you
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
belgian
pale
ales
o
great
beer
and
well
worth
the
money
overall
i
love
ommegang
and
this
brew
snuck
up
on
me
not
as
big
as
their
other
brews
but
it
holds
it
own
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lower
abv
beer
with
complexity
try
this
o
drinkable
and
flavorful
not
overly
hopped
spot
on
for
the
style
would
love
to
try
this
again
from
a
fresh
bottle
massive
head
and
took
5
min
just
to
pour
a
12
oz
golden
orange
in
color
smells
like
honey
citrus
bit
of
banana
and
yeasty

flavor
has
more
banana
with
some
dry
and
sweet
flavors
mixing
in
like
hay
and
honey
sweet
and
velvety
mouthfeel
for
the
style
without
much
carbonation
carbonation
somehow
comes
in

after

overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
pale
ale
very
well
balanced
with
nice

very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
some
fresher
bottles
for
sure
o
great
take
on
the
style
with
just
enough
hops
to
let
you
know
its
american
this
beer
has
all
the
integrity
i
have
come
to
expect
form
ommegang
o
a
bit
overcarbed
but
otherwise
has
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
to
it
that
is
fairly
easily
drinkable
o
i
want
to
try
another
with
a
date
within
the
stated
limits
i
can
tell
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
pale
but
i
dont
know
if
i
am
tasting
this
at
its
best
the
beer
is
satisfyingly
full
and
effervescent
in
its
physical
presence
on
the
palate
but
for
all
this
promising
buildup
its
flavor
disappoints
it
is
understated
to
a
fault
lacking
fulsomeness
it
is
refreshing
i
suppose
but
veers
if
anywhere
toward
the
metallic
there
is
a
pleasant
but
ohsomild
hoppy
aftertaste
almost
imperceptibly
seasoned
with
pickled
spiced
lemon
alas
its
bpa
is
not
this
esteemed
brewers
most
appealing
product
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
a
robust
and
definite
character
o
very
impressive
everything
about
this
ale
just
stands
out
of
the
norm
the
style
the
smell
the
tastefeel
so
worth
the
buy
i
have
been
investing
a
lot
more
into
corked
bottles
lately
and
an
exceptional
beer
just
like
this
one
reminds
me
on
how
much
more
it
is
worth
to
to
go
that
extra
mile
or
dollar
in
this
case
i
was
going
to
grab
the
tripel
karmeleit
this
evening
but
i
am
glad
i
made
this
choice
this
is
a
must
try
beer
hands
down
enjoy
i
know
i
did
overall
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
very
pale
mixed
with
the
spices
adds
alot
of
sweet
and
sour
one
of
the
cheaper
brews
ommegang
makes
and
a
good
representive
of
the
style
worth
a
drink
for
sure
body
is
light
to
medium
goes
down
rather
quick
and
smooth
leaves
a
light
coat
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
dry
finish
had
some
crisp
light
sweetness
right
off
from
the
pale
malts
a
bit
biscuity
and
crackery
even
a
touch
bready
was
decently
bitter
with
rindyness
well
displayed
here
in
addition
to
the
citrus
action
there
was
some
funky
belgian
yeast
characteristics
in
the
dryish
finish
nothing
that
knocked
my
sox
off
but
it
was
tasty
and
satisfying
from
start
to
end
prosit
1488
gotta
love
ommegang
looks
great
on
the
pour
nose
is
real
strong
dough
and
some
floral
tones
strong
and
unabashed
flavor
real
in
your
face
er
mouth
and
just
doesnt
slow
down
consistent
and
strong
delivery
lots
of
dough
which
may
be
a
turnoff
to
some
people
either
way
this
is
a
good
belgian
ale
as
i
would
expect
from
ommegang
o
not
tops
in
the
world
but
certainly
fantastic
this
brewery
can
do
no
wrong
imho
lets
hope
they
dont
start
that
friggin
micro
fracking
in
ny
otherwise
they
may
be
forced
to
move
i
gotta
not
take
this
one
for
granted
and
put
it
into
the
regular
rotation
holley
molley
this
was
one
surprisingly
good
beer
i
am
always
in
search
of
next
great
pale
ale
this
beer
was
a
new
addition
to
our
are
market
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
is
excellent
blending
of
belgian
style
beers
and
ipas
very
good
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
kind
of
a
soso
beer
for
me
pours
alright
a
bright
yellow
color
big
time
floral
smell
and
it
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
well
its
very
dry
with
notes
of
grass
grain
lemon
complex
yet
quite
drinkable
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
but
its
not
very
refreshing
other
folks
might
take
to
it
a
little
better
than
me
i
would
understand
drinkability
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
brew
nothing
about
it
is
overthetop
and
none
of
the
elements
dominate
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
and
pleasing
experience
nose
of
orange
lemon
yeast
bread
and
herbal
notes
reminiscent
of
lavender
maybe
some
hints
of
mango
and
slight
banana
the
taste
is
very
similar
lemon
yeast
orangey
citrus
bready
notes
apricot
mango
and
some
grapefruit
the
yeastybready
flavors
are
the
most
prominent
in
the
long
haul
those
really
stick
around
while
the
citrus
from
the
dryhopping
move
in
and
out
quickly
on
the
back
end
mango
floats
back
up
onto
the
palate
and
out
through
the
nose
pretty
delicious
overall
even
though
light
belgianstyle
ales
arent
really
my
type
very
nice
beer
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
definitely
worth
a
try
though
smells
of
funky
belgian
phenolics
and
yeast
primarily
with
dried
orange
peel
and
spice
florals
and
clove
aplenty
tastes
of
all
these
things
with
a
definite
focus
on
several
varieties
of
citric
peel
as
it
warms
it
gains
a
certain
tannic
wooden
astringency
that
helps
provide
a
drier
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
levels

slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet

banana
fruit
fruit

the
flavor
was
of

banana
fruit
fruit
hop
spice
earth
and

it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with

overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
this
was
a
fair
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
really
stood
out
at
all
on
it
to
me
i
went
back
a
second
day
and
accidently
ordered
the
same
brew
as
i
forgot
i
hadnt
ticked
it
the
day
before
and
immediately
got
upset
with
myself
while
this
one
isnt
bad
it
just
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
as
i
really
wanted
something
that
would
wow
me
unfortunately
this
was
not
it
worth
trying
for
yourself
to
give
it
a
shot
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
but
also
delicate
and
a
little
silky
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
of
the
style
i
really
like
the
use
of
the
citrusy
american
hops
in
it
its
well
balanced
easy
drinking
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
very
solid
beer
all
around
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
feels
refreshing
alcohol
is
hidden
well
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
a
pretty
well
made
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
yeastiness
that
a
lot
of
belgians
tend
to
have
its
easily
drinkable
and
offers
nice
light
fruitiness
to
keep
you
interested
i
prefer
the
rare
vos
over
this
but
this
deserves
a
try
as
well
o
an
incredibly
tasty
bpa
that
nails
the
highlights
for
the
style
and
offers
up
a
solid
bouquet
of
hops
super
stoked
to
have
tried
this
and
definitely
recommended
to
anyone
who
has
access
covers
the
bases
yet
doesnt
really
wow
me
in
the
end
my
own
subjective
take
on
it
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
id
have
another
though
it
leave
too
much
of
a
lasting
impression
would
pair
well
with
food
though
lots
of
choices
with
this
one
poured
from
bottle
into
duvel
tulip
the
color
was
cloudy
amber
likely
due
to
spent
yeast
sediment
being
upset
the
head
was
a
white
mixture
of
bubbles
varied
from
tiny
to
midsize
giving
the
visual
character
of
soapsuds
the
nose
was
citruslike
and
maybe
a
bit
floral
that
being
the
initial
impression
the
beer
first
tasted
of
sweet
citrus
and
finished
with
lightmedium
bitterness
that
doesnt
hang
excessively
i
like
a
brewer
that
knows
that
a
beer
is
more
than
hopwater
poured
a
big
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
some
slick
lace
deep
amber
in
color
complex
smell
lots
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
funky
and
sour
taste
follows
the
nose
some
plum
lemon
after
the
hops
up
front
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
very
smooth
and
the
abv
is
well
masked
overall
a
world
class
complex
brew
that
is
a
must
pick
up
o
another
really
great
beer
from
ommegang
since
it
is
dry
hopped
with
cascade
it
is
necessary
to
get
your
mits
on
a
bottle
or
two
as
fresh
as
possible
to
enjoy
bpa
at
its
peak
o
this
beer
is
just
okay
a
good
tasting
and
wellbalanced
pale
ale
with
a
twist
of
sour
and
funky
belgian
yeast
this
beer
is
something
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
sassion
overall
certainly
a
changeup
from
the
american
and
india
pale
ales
everyone
is
used
to
and
likes
so
much
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
style
for
someone
who
likes
the
concept
of
the
apa
and
ipa
but
is
a
little
put
off
by
the
american
tendency
to
get
a
little
crazy
on
the
hoppiness
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
these
types
of
beers
not
necessarily
a
starter
beer
in
my
opinion
good
representation
of
what
i
have
read
and
heard
about
this
style
o
nice
overall
beer
another
crushing
disappointment
from
ommegang
looks
good
hazy
pale
super
long
lasting
head
but
aroma
is
plain
lacking
belgian
spiciness
brett
hops
or
even
pleasant
yeasty
or
malt
aromas
flavor
is
a
big
let
down
with
a
touch
of
slightly
cardboardy
twang
that
bad
homebrew
sometimes
gets
finishes
dry
and
fairly
bitter
but
i
just
cant
see
finishing
this
beer
what
part
of
this
beer
is
belgian
again
should
have
chucked
some
brett
in
here
to
at
least
give
it
some
interest
sad
it
appears
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
head
the
aroma
was
familiarly
hoppy
cascade
and
fairly
yeast
assertive
my
friend
suggested
a
bit
of
mosquito
repellent
the
taste
is
somewhat
more
promising
as
the
chalky
belgian
yeast
character
feels
better
in
the
mouth
than
it
smells
the
interplay
between
yeast
and
hops
is
quite
nice
but
i
still
felt
the
malt
presence
could
be
a
little
better
was
not
a
favorite
of
the
afternoon
but
still
nice
in
its
own
right
a
decent
take
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
from
ommegang
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
id
put
it
up
against
just
about
any
bpa
out
there
o
what
a
nice
change
up
from
american
pale
ales
havent
had
many
of
these
but
maybe
seeking
them
out
wouldnt
be
such
a
bad
idea
this
one
is
top
notch
overall
a
very
drinkable
dynamic
belgian
pale
ale
i
would
pick
this
up
again
especially
if
i
want
something
that
is
more
on
the
belgianpilsner
malt
side
of
pale
ales
overall
an
extremely
good
tasting
brew
with
a
low
alcohol
content
for
a
belgian
ale
which
makes
this
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
long
served
at
a
good
temperature
and
with
a
large
fluffy
frothy
billowy
cream
colored
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
a
couple
of
lazy
bubble
trails
aroma
is
a
traditional
belgian
blonde
spicy
malt
a
bit
of
fruit
not
overly
sweet
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
flat
side
finish
is
similar
to
flavor
and
on
the
short
side
beer
promises
huge
dividends
and
is
excellent
but
seems
somehow
as
if
it
should
be
better
overall
try
it
why
not
litterally
nothing
to
lose
though
i
recommend
this
on
warmer
climates
might
change
your
judgement
of
the
beer
hope
you
enjoy
salud
exceptional
brew
everything
a
belgianstyle
pale
ale
should
be
high
level
of
complexity
and
balance
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
foamy
rings

down

is

herbal
hops
and
a
slightly
funk
gym
sock
aroma
taste
is
of
maltgrain
grassy
hops
and
a
slight
funk
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
not
too
crazy
about
the
smell
though
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
the
smell
is
outstanding
and
the
rest
is
very
good
lots
of
bubbly
fizz
solid
and
hoppy
this
is
a
good
choice
and
something
id
love
to
snag
at
the
bar
overall
b
drinks
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
big
citric
inclusions
and
the
hoppiness
the
taste
was
very
much
like
a
mildly
hoppy
standard
belgian
wit
it
had
all
the
drying
bittering
wheat
one
could
hope
for
with
a
nice
dash
of
clove
we
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bolder
feel
with
a
thicker
body
and
more
punch
from
the
paler
side
of
the
malts
meh
its
decent
enough
but
i
expected
and
hoped
for
more
of
a
balanced
flavor
however
the
spicy
yeast
flavor
overpowers
everything
usually
ipas
are
too
hoppy
for
me
but
this
is
not
only
within
my
tolerance
but
something
i
can
enjoy
it
does
challenge
my
taste
buds
which
are
more
accustomed
to
porters
and
stouts
as
well
as
my
beer
vocabulary
pours
a
light
to
medium
copper
amber
with
immense
thick
white
foam
very
sticky
patchy
everywhere
classic
belgian
yeast
smell
and
tropical
fruits
to
boot
firm
hop
taste
evolves
into
a
fruity
malty
blend
smooth
fruity
balanced
on
the
lighter
side
and
clean
throughout
finishes
easy
very
tasty
bpa
these
guys
know
what
they
are
doing
nice
regular
gold
in
appearance
smell
is
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
hits
the
nose
well
this
is
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
wet
in
and
dry
out
of
the
mouth
well
done
fruity
sweet
hoppy
and
well
balanced
overall
this
beer
is
so
fridge
worthy
we
cant
afford
to
fill
the
fridge
whoya
wow
ohea
and
smaakelijk
says
the
dutchman
this
will
go
well
with
an
excuse
to
have
another
o
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
could
tell
right
from
opening
it
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
aggressively
carbonated
beer
the
head
on
this
beer
was
very
interesting
foamed
very
fast
probably
one
of
the
most
intense
heads
ive
encountered
before
and
took
a
peculiar
shape
that
had
great
retention
one
word
of
advice
is
to
be
very
careful
when
pouring
overall
this
beer
was
very
good
for
a
pale
ale
nice
slightly
sweet
well
balanced
taste
interesting
beer
but
ultimately
too
dry
and
sour
for
my
tastes
perhaps
best
left
as
a
complement
to
food
on
a
hot
day
if
only
the
taste
matched
the
awesome
smell
8
a
750
this
was
an
average
bpa
there
was
quite
a
bit
to
taste
but
i
felt
the
flavor
was
a
little
too
thin
o
a
decent
but
not
great
offering
from
a
brewery
ive
come
to
know
and
love
i
guess
its
an
acceptable
example
of
a
belgian
pale
but
it
doesnt
really
do
the
brewery
justice
being
a
homebrewer
i
would
have
tried
to
smooth
the
pepper
hop
profile
and
balance
the
noble
hops
a
little
better
not
bad
just
not
one
of
ommegangs
better
beers
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
for
a
standard
bpa
and
it
isnt
adequately
spiced
to
consider
it
a
good
belgian
fit
not
as
good
as
the
ommegang
rare
vos
on
tap
at
the
dutch
golden
hue
capped
by
a
nice
head
with
good
retention
slightly
cloudy
smell
is
full
of
flower
and
light
cracker
well
balanced
by
light
malt
slightly
cutting
bitterness
from
flower
light
grass
and
hay
light
to
medium
bodied
this
is
a
tremendous
belgian
pale
i
love
this
man
i
gotta
have
another
orval
sometime
soon
not
my
favorite
style
but
now
im
not
sure
which
is
my
favorite
example
my
compliments
to
the
brewer
on
a
skillfully
made
beer
i
want
whatever
yeast
strain
they
use
to
get
this
great
fruitiness
flavor
wise
its
got
that
yeasty
backbone
with
some
subtle
hop
sweetness
in
the
middle
with
a
nice
dry
crisp
finish
overall
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
tasty
beer
nonetheless
beginners
may
not
appreciate
all
that
is
going
on
here
but
they
should
not
shy
away
from
it
o
overall
a
nice
introduction
for
me
to
this
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
suspect
that
it
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
little
too
long
it
nice
to
see
a
combination
of
fruity
and
hoppy
flavors
overall
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
if
you
were
going
to
have
several
taste
is
pleasant
but
not
overally
controversail
overall
not
a
bad
offering
from
ommegang
a
good
begginer
beer
into
the
bpa
style
for
me
still
looking
into
this
style
all
the
time
and
will
be
hitting
this
up
again
in
the
future
would
like
to
see
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
citrus
and
tart
flavors
overall
a
solid
belgian
pale
im
not
finding
much
fault
w
this
one
i
recommend
you
listen
to
the
band
kiss
with
this
beer
i
figure
kiss
lovers
will
enjoy
this
beer
did
you
know
kiss
sold
more
albums
than
the
beatles
gene
simmons
likes
to
remind
the
world
of
that
often
o
meh
alright
beer
neither
a
great
ommegang
nor
a
great
belgian
pale
still
perhaps
a
cut
above
many
other
pale
ales
in
general
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
it
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
faithful
to
its
belgian
roots
but
with
a
great
american
hop
character
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
and
am
disappointed
to
have
not
sampled
this
one
earlier
overall
i
really
like
ommegangs
take
on
the
style
the
fruity
elements
the
hop
character
and
the
wellbalanced
finish
are
very
appealing
o
a
delicious
bpa
with
wonderful
complexities
yet
a
very
easy
drinker
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
o
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
overall
very
nice
looking
and
tasting
brew
with
a
lingering
mouthfeel
and
mild
scent
bottle
poured
a
clear
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
super
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
ester
and
some
dry
hoppy
notes
is
very
interesting
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
fruity
ester
with
a
semisweet
belgian
malt
base
and
some
dry
hoppy
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
with
great
drinkability
factor
though
lacking
some
minor
notes
of
floral
aroma
overall
pleasant
bold
complex
brew
great
variety
and
balance
of
malt
and
hop
flavor
exceptional
mouthfeel
pours
honey
colored
and
a
bit
cloudy
into
a
snifter
with
the
ommegang
signature
frothing
over
the
top
crazy
head
aroma
is
floral
hops
and
belgian
yeast
tastes
a
little
fruity
with
a
round
floral
hop
finish
really
really
nice
beer
to
session
as
it
has
a
lower
abv
than
many
ommegang
beers
and
the
complexity
makes
the
thirsty
man
curious
for
more
on
the
pricey
side
but
it
is
money
well
spent
update
on
tap
this
is
an
entirely
different
beer
for
the
better
the
yeast
is
almost
tropical
and
the
hops
seem
more
fresh
not
to
be
missed
on
tap
golden
in
color
and
nearly
white
as
it
shined
through
really
amazing
color
here
or
lack
there
of
i
should
say
big
white
fizzy
head
of
foam
then
rises
up
two
fingers
high
and
settles
down
quickly
leaving
only
a
light
bit
of
lacing
on
the
sides
but
tons
of
carbonation
bubbling
toward
the
surface
aroma
is
light
fresh
grass
lemon
zest
hints
of
grain
and
light
pear
all
come
out
but
you
have
to
search
for
them
to
find
them
as
i
take
a
sip
though
a
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
ale
reveals
itself
very
nicely
done
here
on
the
taste
light
airy
with
a
light
bitter
back
to
it
it
had
a
touch
of
bite
nice
clean
easy
carbonation
and
light
dry
finish
more
hop
character
than
expected
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
in
this
perfect
winter
city
moment
its
quite
nice
as
with
many
examples
of
the
style
i
find
the
hops
end
up
blunting
the
yeast
flavors
a
bit
more
than
i
would
like
still
a
very
flavorful
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
this
is
way
more
complex
and
way
more
interesting
than
i
anticipated
unlike
some
other
ommegang
beers
this
was
a
nice
surprise
if
i
had
to
compare
it
to
anything
id
say
that
it
was
like
a
lighter
less
complex
duvel
o
easily
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
definitely
worth
having
again
o
this
is
a
solid
if
slightly
onedimensional
take
on
the
style
in
the
end
i
feel
that
it
is
a
bit
overrated
by
fans
of
the
brewery
still
ommegang
comes
closer
to
some
of
the
new
wave
belgian
pale
ales
than
many
other
american
craft
breweries
worth
a
try
but
a
little
forgettable
o
delightful
beer
i
know
it
was
released
in
spring
and
ommegangs
site
describes
it
as
being
a
good
summer
beer
but
its
the
day
before
thanksgiving
and
im
loving
it
disclaimer
i
live
in
texas
and
its
hot
outside
o
this
one
is
okay
but
i
would
stick
with
ipas
instead
t
fairly
dry
with
some
notes
of
clove
and
a
slight
bit
of
banana
some
grassy
hop
resin
creeps
in
on
the
finish
overall
very
nice
borderline
belgian
ipa
refreshing
and
complex
everything
about
this
beer
screams
quality
the
color
is
a
slightly
orange
golden
with
a
perfect
tall
off
white
head
that
lasted
and
clung
the
smell
is
mild
citrus
mixed
with
that
classic
belgian
aroma
that
is
not
at
all
over
powering
the
taste
is
again
citrusy
hop
and
malt
finished
just
about
in
the
middle
of
sweet
and
dry
the
bottle
promises
perfect
balance
and
they
have
delivered
on
the
promise
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
too
that
adds
to
the
medium
body
of
the
mouth
feel
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
think
this
will
be
on
the
table
for
thanksgiving
dinner
an
excellent
beer
overall
o
a
pretty
great
belgian
apa
manages
to
balance
the
yeast
and
hops
into
something
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
bpas
i
have
tried
this
is
a
bpa
that
everyone
should
give
a
try
its
not
too
hoppy
but
its
subtle
enough
for
those
who
arent
normally
into
hops
to
enjoy
this
beer
you
can
tell
alot
of
love
was
putting
into
making
this
beer
from
its
appearence
its
smell
all
the
way
down
to
its
taste
d
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
the
nose
is
exceptional
but
the
rest
of
this
brew
is
solidly
slightly
more
than
average
in
all
other
categories
and
you
know
the
saying
about
being
only
as
strong
as
your
weakest
link
solid
respectable
and
worthy
but
not
much
more
kudos
ommegang
o
very
aromatic
and
flavourful
a
nice
blend
of
belgian
and
pale
ale
characteristics
that
creates
its
own
thing
bright
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fine
ale
the
belgian
aspects
of
this
beer
take
it
to
the
next
level
there
is
depth
here
and
interesting
flavorsranging
from
the
powerful
pale
pungency
to
the
downtoearth
farmhouse
earthy
warmth
this
beer
is
complex
intriguing
and
delicious
lightmedium
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
simply
because
its
not
really
exceptional
still
enjoyable
overall
recommended
medium
bodied
with
some
tight
carbonation
and
a
strong
earthy
hop
presence
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
dry
finish
slightly
floral
with
some
grassy
pine
and
faint
citrus
fruit
complimented
by
some
peppery
spice
only
slightly
dry
but
not
very
bitter
countered
by
some
pale
malt
and
crisp
light
fruit
overall
the
palate
is
surprisingly
full
and
its
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
terribly
flavorful
or
interesting
i
agree
with
some
others
that
this
beer
may
be
overdone
the
head
the
mustiness
it
seems
they
tried
to
make
a
powerhouse
version
of
the
belgian
original
style
and
its
a
little
off
d
highly
drinkable
belgian
pale
ale
great
balance
of
flavor
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
decent
bpa
but
nothing
exciting
it
is
what
it
is
fairly
average
to
the
style
fairly
decent
drinkability
od
a
very
solid
belgian
pale
ale
flavourful
and
balanced
with
yeasty
esters
and
hops
with
a
good
malt
backbone
to
boot
so
very
drinkable
and
tasty
great
like
it
alot
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
but
something
about
it
seemed
like
it
was
lacking
to
me
i
felt
that
the
flavor
profile
seemed
watered
down
overall
drinkability
quite
nice
good
as
a
sipper
good
with
a
meal
and
quite
interesting
i
could
have
another
quite
easily
overall
quite
a
nice
bpa
not
unexpected
from
ommegang
delicious
o
very
enjoyable
an
easy
drinker
i
am
not
familiar
with
belgian
pale
ales
but
will
check
them
out
in
the
future
its
no
wonder
that
this
is
quickly
becoming
ommegangs
flagship
beer
its
delicious
complex
refreshing
and
moderately
sessionable
at
least
as
far
as
ommegangs
beers
go
this
is
an
awesome
beer
style
that
isnt
brewed
nearly
often
enough
and
this
is
a
fine
example
love
it
overall
i
must
say
i
didnt
enjoy
this
but
its
not
the
beers
fault
it
is
the
styles
fault
i
only
try
these
when
they
are
free
or
extras
in
a
trade
because
i
cant
stand
the
belgian
yeast
and
malt
bill
flavor
i
know
i
am
on
the
outside
with
this
opinion
but
i
dont
care
i
will
never
trade
the
cellar
for
a
westy
cause
i
promise
you
i
will
hate
it
thanks
to
merc7186
for
the
extra
i
very
much
appreciate
the
beer
o
i
really
love
this
brew
and
i
feel
that
it
has
become
the
standard
by
which
all
belgian
pale
ales
should
be
measured
such
quality
and
such
balance
another
beautiful
one
from
ommegang
very
belgian
in
nature
and
its
only
my
pesky
brain
telling
me
that
it
resembles
unibroue
in
its
homage
easy
to
drink
if
youre
in
that
somewhat
downhome
bucolic
farm
mood
that
belgian
ale
tends
to
inspires
in
me
o
what
can
i
say
ommegang
does
well
every
time
and
this
is
no
exception
will
be
glad
to
buy
this
one
again
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
lively
carbonation
a
good
bpa
overall
very
refreshing
and
another
solid
offering
from
ommegang
a
nice
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
long
lasting
head
and
good
lacing
on
the
pour
aroma
and
taste
of
citrusy
hops
some
lemon
peel
with
some
sweet
fruit
spices
some
belgian
yeast
and
some
nice
biscuit
malt
a
nice
medium
body
and
crisp
mouth
feel
and
nice
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
citrus
hops
lemon
peel
sweet
fruit
spices
some
nice
belgian
yeast
with
a
nice
nutty
malty
ending
for
balance
overall
a
very
nice
bpa
fruity
crisp
and
refreshing
medium
body
with
a
bit
less
effervescence
than
one
would
expect
from
the
head
finish
is
fairly
drying
though
there
is
a
nicely
fading
grapefruitpeppermalt
aftertaste
somewhat
warming
at
the
back
of
the
throat
after
it
warms
for
15
minutes
or
so
this
is
a
beer
that
could
be
sessioned
quite
easily
all
said
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
the
best
from
ommegang
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
this
again
for
sure
and
for
11
its
reasonable
and
a
welcome
addition
to
alberta
shelves
overall
one
of
the
first
belgian
pale
ales
that
ive
had
that
had
some
of
the
flavours
found
in
a
west
coast
ipa
it
really
had
a
lot
of
that
grapefruitorangepeach
flavour
there
was
also
quite
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
which
i
enjoyed
id
buy
this
beer
again
any
time
o
a
tasty
beer
but
as
much
as
i
love
ommegang
beers
this
one
was
only
slightly
above
par
for
me
o
tastes
to
me
a
little
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
and
i
love
those
this
is
yet
another
great
offering
from
a
great
brewery
d
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
extra
hop
presence
pours
a
muddled
golden
orange
with
a
lofty
bubbly
eggshell
head
it
smells
great
aromas
of
tangerine
and
pineapple
some
sweet
malt
belgian
yeast
and
lemon
meringue
tastes
of
bitter
lemon
and
orange
peel
with
some
pepper
and
a
hint
of
clove
the
bitter
aftertaste
is
nice
light
with
a
load
of
carbonation
very
soft
bubbles
and
a
dry
finish
wow
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
might
become
one
of
my
new
regulars
overall
excellent
taste
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
bpas
o
a
great
price
i
got
it
for
5
99
for
a
very
exceptional
beer
i
love
the
play
between
the
belgian
and
pale
ale
styles
they
really
help
each
other
out
in
the
best
of
ways
this
beer
poured
a
very
cloudy
yellow
color
and
formed
a
foamy
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
yeastscitrus
lemon
wheat
and
pepper
the
flavor
was
of
hops
belgian
yeasts
bread
and
a
hint
of
malt
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
bittersweet
oim
a
huge
ommegang
fan
and
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
has
great
belgian
pale
ale
characteristics
a
little
extra
fruit
aroma
and
taste
charcteristics
and
is
well
priced
for
the
quality
of
the
beer
o
this
is
a
delicious
beer
refreshing
with
wonderful
complexity
a
great
beer
with
food
curious
about
how
this
would
taste
in
a
fresher
bottle
i
liked
it
a
lot
with
the
hops
on
the
gentler
side
as
the
flavor
was
really
balanced
and
the
bitterness
didnt
overwhelm
the
other
taste
aspects
the
carbonation
came
close
to
being
too
much
but
wasnt
just
barely
m
medium
body
with
a
nice
chew
very
smooth
light
carbonation
appearance
is
a
light
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
the
smell
of
ommegangs
bpa
has
sweet
malts
spices
orange
grass
while
the
taste
has
grains
as
well
as
a
decent
hop
profile
with
some
belgian
yeast
present
as
well
mf
lightmedium
with
a
similar
carbonation
level
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
a
couple
glasses
of
along
with
a
meal
mouthfeel
is
a
light
and
loose
body
it
moves
uninterrupted
over
the
palate
pushed
along
with
short
crisp
carbonation
finishes
very
easy
bold
and
fiery
amberorange
frothy
offwhite
head
the
lingers
and
leaves
a
curtain
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
a
strong
combination
of
orange
and
caramel
malt
along
side
some
mellow
but
balanced
earthy
yeast
tart
flavor
from
the
yeast
upfront
which
gives
way
to
the
caramel
toasty
malts
that
soon
gets
washed
over
by
some
fruity
orange
and
lemon
similar
to
the
nose
finishes
with
a
earthy
yeast
bite
along
with
some
other
character
most
likely
from
hops
i
cant
recognize
smooth
malty
body
all
the
way
through
with
a
lot
of
yeast
and
hops
working
together
nicely
great
brew
from
ommegang
id
recommend
for
the
hotter
days
it
really
quenches
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
neither
the
belgian
character
nor
the
west
coast
hop
character
comes
through
in
the
taste
it
seems
a
bit
muddled
overall
well
done
brew
enjoyable
and
drinkable
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
flavor
character
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
belgianstyle
pale
but
i
find
it
good
nonetheless
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
pkg
on
040411
best
by

sampled
on

2011
it
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
murky
cloudy
tone
and
a
bit
of
sedimentary
deposits
floating
about
the
aroma
is
all
encompassing
sugar
sweet
fruity
and
hoppy
the
body
is
bold
but
also
smooth
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
with
a
bit
of
berries
and
a
clearly
dry
hopped
finish
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
ommegang
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
hops
are
subtle
and
somewhat
spicey
but
really
the
malts
and
yeast
shine
through
the
rest
another
solid
beer
from
ommegang
good
balance
and
a
great
body
the
only
fault
i
can
find
with
this
one
is
that
the
longer
you
sit
on
the
finish
the
less
enjoyable
it
is
excellent
american
made
belgian
not
a
horrible
price
10
a
4
pack
but
not
a
deal
either
ill
get
this
again
o
just
a
bit
bitter
which
detracts
from
the
wonderful
early
tangerine
sweetness
another
fine
entry
from
ommegang
and
one
with
more
american
personality
than
the
label
text
lets
on
perhaps
not
their
most
mindblowing
but
definitely
satisfying
enough
you
could
knock
several
of
these
back
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
theyd
totally
utterly
hit
the
spot
reccomended
personally
i
like
the
great
divide
belgica
and
hades
for
this
kind
of
style
or
a
saison
with
more
malty
interest
this
is
just
quite
austere
and
chalky
quite
a
mineral
aftertaste
o
most
impressive
beer
ive
had
from
ommegang
thanks
for
the
birthday
gift
a
good
easy
drinker
call
it
very
drinkable
great
summertime
brew
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
w
a
nice
two
finger
off
white
head
good
carbonation
and
decent
lacing
on
this
beer
smell
is
that
of
malt
grains
clove
smell
is
definitely
on
the
weak
side
for
this
style
taste
is
the
same
profile
and
theres
just
something
missing
in
this
brew
it
doesnt
meet
the
best
in
the
style
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
and
dry
side
for
this
style
it
needs
to
have
more
substance
to
it
to
score
higher
overall
this
beer
misses
the
mark
on
the
style
its
not
bad
but
you
can
find
a
lot
better
examples
to
drink
pretty
sure
i
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
a
disappointing
beer
from
a
really
good
brewery
on
tap
at
the
bulldog
in
minneapolis
served
it
its
own
glass
this
beer
arrives
a
clear
orangegold
color
the
head
is
a
firm
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
with
a
hint
of
barnyard
funk
the
taste
is
a
lot
funkier
than
the
aroma
but
not
over
the
top
there
are
also
some
nice
citrucy
notes
in
the
back
ground
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
belgian
pale
ale
i
will
happily
drink
this
beer
again
this
pours
a
yeast
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
foamy
head
the
smell
is
semi
sweet
i
get
some
banana
cloves
and
a
little
bready
malts
feel
is
medium
lots
of
tingling
sensations
and
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
great
i
get
a
load
of
fruity
sweetness
and
some
bread
malts
followed
by
a
very
nice
dryness
and
a
little
bitterness
this
is
a
might
fine
tasting
beer
and
ill
get
it
again
this
is
my
type
of
summer
beer
the
palate
opens
with
an
unanticipated
bretty
clove
flavor
this
beer
has
none
of
the
other
characteristics
youd
expect
from
a
bretted
beer
it
didnt
gush
theres
still
some
heft
to
the
palate
but
that
spice
character
is
quite
noticeable
further
sips
and
gulps
allow
the
grapefruit
to
come
to
the
forefront
along
with
the
chalk
to
replicate
that
clove
brett
character
apart
from
the
clove
and
hops
this
beer
does
have
a
mild
honey
flavor
before
drying
out
on
the
finish
leaving
flavors
of
clove
citrus
hop
and
grainy
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
adding
the
yeast
to
the
pour
adds
a
little
heft
to
the
palate
and
increases
the
spiciness
here
ultimately
this
beer
is
mediumlight
crisply
carbonated
and
has
an
enjoyable
finish
solid
stuff
but
for
the
money
id
rather
buy
a
duvel
o
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
girlfriend
couldnt
stand
it
she
wanted
to
start
a
profile
to
describe
her
feelings
for
this
beer
it
seemed
unbalanced
maybe
it
could
use
more
of
a
citrus
presence
or
a
bigger
malt
profile
but
some
of
the
flavors
didnt
mix
well
in
my
opinion
the
pale
ale
taste
is
subtle
but
interesting
it
has
a
hoppy
character
along
with
the
mild
belgian
yeast
taste
i
would
never
refust
one
of
these
but
i
will
not
necessarily
seek
them
out
either
its
an
interesting
beer
with
a
complex
mouthfeel
the
taste
isnt
what
i
expected
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
overall
drinkable
obviously
packed
with
flavor
high
on
complexities
the
subtle
note
of
cascade
hops
works
in
the
dry

carbonation
is
high
as
evidence
would
suggest
and
it
dries
up
off
of
your
tongue
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
overall
light
character
and
smooth
flavors
make
this
a
fairly
easy
drinking
belgian
a
beautiful
orangecopper
color
with
a
small
head
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
but
also
a
little
bitter
grassy
aromas
taste
follows
with
some
belgian
spices
and
banana
flavors
that
quickly
move
into
a
more
bitter
grassy
taste
this
is
a
nice
belgian
to
use
as
a
thirst
quencher
the
bitterness
helps
move
the
sweeter
spices
thru
the
palate
and
make
this
very
drinkible
the
beer
is
a
bazy
deep
copper
color
plenty
of
fine
floating
sediment
and
a
huge
frothy
head
maybe
4
fingers
worth
the
aroma
has
the
belgian
character
kind
of
smells
like
a
muted
belgian
ipa
it
smells
a
little
more
bitter
than
it
actually
tastes
i
think
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
tempers
it
well
very
balanced
crisp
and
dry
not
a
sipper
but
not
really
a
chugger
either
just
easy
drinking
goodness
d
big
flavor
and
comlexity
yet
moderate
abv
make
this
surprisingly
drinkable
the
flavor
starts
off
with
belgian
spices
and
orange
peel
before
giving
way
to
a
spritzy
pale
malt
note
that
suggests
bread
dough
and
saltine
crackers
the
hops
come
across
as
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
pine
and
florals
while
the
yeast
adds
tropical
fruit
notes
mouthfeel
is
crisp
mediumlight
in
body
and
almost
too
carbonated
but
bubbly
enough
to
kick
in
some
zest
to
the
palate
bpa
is
an
easy
sipper
and
one
of
the
better
belgian
pales
ive
come
across
in
recent
memory
distinctly
american
but
holds
true
to
its
stylistic
roots
goes
great
with
a
rice
dish
recommended
tasted
from
750ml
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
tan
orange
with
a
thin
beige
head
hoppy
nose
with
that
signature
belgian
yeasty
smell
that
always
reminds
me
of
lemon
and
biscuit
palate
is
super
mellow
with
the
hops
taking
a
back
seat
lemon
zest
biscuit
black
pepper
and
light
hops
flavor
round
out
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
very
high
with
a
sticky
texture
and
a
rather
short
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinker
that
will
go
great
with
foods
great
beer
here
not
an
all
day
drinker
but
something
great
to
have
after
or
during
a
summer
meal
amongst
friends
the
spiciness
would
add
to
many
types
of
fare

of

with

a

drfits
on
into
the
distance
its
all
pretty
light
and
breezy
fitting
nicely
with
the
sunniness
outside
and
in
the
glass
currently
the
top
of
the
bpa
heap
right
now
i
picked
up
a
bottle
from
abes
cold
beer
for
910
and
split
it
with
a
couple
friends
the
beer
appeared
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
tall
white
head
that
left
lacing
at
first
i
was
struck
by
the
delicate
bready
malt
and
candy
character
then
i
was
amazed
by
the
citrus
and
apricot
hop
flavor
thats
quite
a
pairing
of
malts
and
hops
in
a
belgian
pale
but
the
flavors
are
expertly
balanced
and
sublimely
subtle
find
this
beer
its
not
quite
like
anything
ive
tried
straight
from
belgium
but
theres
no
doubt
about
its
heritage
d
this
was
a
really
pleasant
surprise
i
have
never
had
a
bad
ommegang
beer
but
hadnt
been
wowed
by
them
in
a
while
this
beer
hits
right
in
my
sweet
spot
and
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
and
again
mediumlight
that
quickly
dissipates
to
thin
and
long
lasting
lacing
overall
im
once
again
not
let
down
by
ommegang
a
well
done
bpa
thats
well
worth
a
shot
better
now
than
later
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
into
a
pint
glass
murky
yeasty
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
with
light
hops
taste
has
the
hops
a
bit
stronger
but
easy
to
drink
nice
easy
to
drink
balanced
ale
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
drink
it
in
a
world
were
there
are
few
commercial
examples
of
american
hops
and
belgian
inspired
yeast
strains
especially
under
7
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
cant
see
this
standing
up
if
a
lot
more
of
these
get
made
though
as
it
is
though
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
the
malt
seems
to
muddle
things
a
bit
it
does
add
complexity
but
seems
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
crisp
hops
and
interesting
yeast
character
though
it
does
add
extra
complexity
which
isnt
really
needed
in
a
beer
chockfull
hops
and
yeast
character
this
would
also
be
a
bit
lighter
and
more
refreshing
without
the
extra
malt
character
and
i
dont
think
that
would
be
a
bad
thing
nice
big
foamy
white
head
on
this
dark
orange
brew
it
looks
like
a
belgian
brew
smell
is
anything
but
lots
of
citrus
and
hops
with
just
a
faint
scent
of
belgian
sugar
taste
is
damn
near
perfect
starts
out
like
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
slightly
fruit
before
a
big
bitterness
takes
over
lots
of
citrus
like
an
american
ipa
this
brew
is
heavily
hopped
and
a
great
american
take
on
a
belgian
brew
ive
been
waiting
for
someone
to
do
a
great
job
pairing
belgian
ales
with
american
hops
and
this
brew
delivers
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
big
frosty
rich
head
just
a
touch
of
haze
lazy
thick
sticky
lacings
light
floral
aroma

bready
or
yeasty
undertones
not
a
prominent
bouquet
nice
lively
carbonation
very
even
full
body
feel
and
nice
smooth
finish
pleasant
sweet

flavor
with
a

finish

i
thoroughly
enjoyed

intermingled
nicely

very
refreshing
and

and
tasty
nice
balancing
act
between
the
two
styles
niether
one
overpowers
the
other
well
done
the
body
is
lightish
with
an
abundant
co2
but
carries
an
underlying
weight
this
is
its
strength
its
a
drinker
and
built
as
such
but
has
some
nuance
and
depth
tacked
on
even
if
its
not
all
congruent
it
fakes
it
well
not
worth
big
dollars
but
otherwise
a

option

dry

will
buy
again
highly
recommended
you
know
i
dont
get
it
belgian
beers
are
good
american
beers
are
good
so
we
should
combine
them
and
that
will
better
i
doesnt
work
in
so
many
cases
some
of
them
i
really
dont
like
this
one
however
stands
out
form
the
group
ommegang
who
have
mastered
the
art
of
belgian
styles
made
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
can
definitely
be
enjoyed
as
a
pale
ale
would
be
very
nice
golden
to
light
golden
color
good
very
light
carbonation
good
aroma
and
very
drinkable
ill
have
this
one
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
decent
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
an
excellent
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
fruity
yeast
aroma
the
hop
character
is
crisp
and
bitter
and
really
compliments
the
belgian
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
great
as
well
wow
what
a
serious
hop
flavor
its
dry
and
bitter
with
a
serious
amount
of
yeast
character
the
malt
bill
is
relatively
simple
and
it
acts
as
a
base
for
what
is
a
terrific
example
of
hops
and
belgian
yeast
compliment
each
other
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
its
one
of
the
best
belgianamerican
pale
ales
on
the
market
deep
gold
in
color
massive
head
of
pure
white
foam
very
spicy
and
earthy
aroma
spicy
flavor
dominates
long
and
lingering
peppery
bite
to
it
heavy
earthy
flavor
has
a
distinct
crisp
sort
of
dryness
mild
citrus
notes
decent
body
a
lot
more
upfront
then
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
still
damn
enjoyable
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
zesty
ommegang
does
belgians
right
its
a
no
brainer
bpa
is
well
balanced
and
does
its
thing
with
ommegangs
house
yeast
strain
a
great
addition
to
the
lineup
and
one
ill
be
trying
again
soon
poured
a
lighter
shade
of
amber
with
a
fluffy
one
and
a
half
finger
bone
white
head
that
held
well
phenols
dominated
the
nose
for
mespicey
with
some
clove
and
lemon
pith
flavors
are
lightly
medicinal
with
some
lemon
oiland
a
bit
of
funk
in
the
finish
its
good
beer
but
the
yeasty
flavors
are
a
little
bit
much
for
me
drinkability
above
average
for
the
style
a
nice
and
bitter
sipper
could
have
a
couple
but
not
likely
to
purchase
again
for
the
price
highly
drinkable
and
satisfying
this
is
a
light
crisp
hoppy
number
that
is
drinkable
year
round
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
special
though
i
am
enjoying
this
but
seems
like
a
watered
down
orval
clone
worth
a
try
but
probably
a
one
time
purchase
for
me
very
hoppy
but
in
a
balanced
way
true
to
the
style
i
mean
like
mamma
bear
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
like
many
belch
beers
it
pushes
the
boundaries
in
this
case
with
hoppyness
but
in
a
way
that
stirs
admiration
and
appreciationthis
definitely
aint
less
filling
tastes
great
drinkability
would
drink
again
if
i
came
across
it
drinkability
high
cheers
in
my
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
sweet
fruit
and
spice
it
had
a
taste
of
banana
mango
and
coriander
sweet
malt
background
a
very
smooth
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
more
of
these
overall
a
nice
flavor
spicy
grassy
and
citrus
hops
nice
malt
presence
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hop
presence
personally
but
its
freshness
is
nice
too
i
wouldnt
want
to
age
this
served
in
a
tulip
style
glass
golden
copper
color
with
about
2
inches
of
foamy
carbonated
head
strong
scents
of
belgian
malts
and
yeast
very
mild
malts
more
forward
hops
the
yeast
bread
like
flavor
is
toasty
bread
like
flavor
makes
this
more
dry
than
sweet
mouthfeel
is
over
all
dry
and
smooth
very
drinkable
in
nature
i
liked
the
color
the
preponderance
of
yeast
flavor
and
the
presentation
of
the
bottle
the
bitterness
and
tartness
was
a
bit
overpowering
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
in
the
taste
really
quite
simple
for
what
it
is
but
extremely
satisfying
for
it
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
and
a
great
addition
to
the
style
i
didnt
get
the
hops
that
the
other
reviewers
describe
could
be
just
my
bottle
i
may
try
again
very
drinkable
bpa
pricey
but
worth
the
try
definitely
something
to
savor
a
beer
that
should
be
available
at
all
times
in
all
ways
a
huge
head
superb
retention
and
solid
lacing
combine
to
make
a
a
beautiful
looking
beer
smell
follows
suit
with
a
melange
of
tropical
fruits
especially
banana
grainy
malt
goodness
yeasty
breads
bubblegum
and
peppery
spiciness
so
much
fragrance
going
on
you
could
spend
the
night
sniffing
citrusy
hops
and
light
caramel
notes
taste
is
a
follow
through
of
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
tart
green
apples
pears
and
grapes
the
dry
hopping
gives
a
clean
and
grapefruit
tinged
finish
with
a
dry
quenching
feel
a
crisp
and
prickly
carbonation
adds
to
that
quenching
aspect
and
really
brings
this
one
close
to
perfect
here
as
there
is
a
creamy
fullness
to
what
is
a
medium
light
brew
drinkability
is
also
close
to
perfect
and
i
may
revise
my
score
in
that
direction
after
i
acquire
a
few
more
of
these
for
the
near
future
what
a
great
brew
low
enough
abv
that
i
drank
the
whole
thing
and
did
not
feel
hammered

greedy

with

its

very
easy

its
a
good

today
and
would
be
even
better
on

and
for

a

its
a
good
beer
at
a
good
price
d
the
ale
straddles
the
divide
between
belgian
pale
ale
and
belgian
ipa
the
hops
are
the
winner
so
much
flavor
packed
into

bottle

had
time
for

served

mild

flavor
up

that
becomes
sweeter
as
the

goes
on
incredibly
drinkable
beer
im
hoping
this
becomes
a
yearround
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
pours
a

some

hang
out
at

a

at

of

fresh

up

paired
with
the
signature
ommegang
yeast
note
some
banana
some

lots

good

perfectly
carbonated
and
very

this

i
dont

seeing

i
really
enjoyed
this
new
limited
offering
from
ommegang
cloudy
lemony
yellow
giant
white

etc
just
what
you
would
expect
from
this
style
in
general
some
nice
lemons
in
the
nose
and
a
face
full
of
yeast
this
is
a
beer
from
ommegang
of
course
lightly
fizzed
which
provides
a
decent
bite
nice
for
a
summer
day
yeast
and
peaches
dominate
the
taste
and
of
course
a
smack
of
hops
that
comes
close
to
the
upper
limits
of
my
tolerance
but
is
not
excessive
not
but
not
zowie
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
brew
in
my
opinion
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
would
be
great
on
a
hot

classy

classy
d
very
nice

this
should
be
a

warm
day
in
upstate
ny
for
the
price
8

i
was
satisfied
again
it
begs
the
question
how
do
beers
that
come
from
belgium
cost
less
still
excellent
beer
all
around
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
honey
color
with
a
lovely
rocky
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
sweet
and
floral
perfect
for
a
spring
release
brew
there
is
some
clove
bubblegum
and
honey
scents
spot
on
for
the
style
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
sweetened
with
candi
sugar
very
light
yeasty
flavor
some
light
clove
and
lighter
coriander
which
transitions
into
a
lemony
tartness
there
is
also
some
light
grassy
hops
towards
the
end
on
par
for
the
style
good
belgian
flavors
that
are
subtle
moderate
body
with
plenty
of
fizzy
carbonation
quite
burpy
nice
balance
on
the
palate
this
is
a
good
bpa
good
flavors
with
a
drinkable
abv
drinks
light
and
crisp
not
too
much
coriander
flavor
which
ommegang
does
on
occasion
could
use

great

kudos
once

ommegang
d
quite
drinkable
again
i
just
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
to
make
me
want
a
second
glass
somewhat
forgettable
ultimately
i
dont
mean
to
be
harsh
theres
very
little
to
criticize
specifically
about
the
beer
really
it
just
didnt
hook
me
in
im
kinda
surprised
to
see
all
the
raves
so
far
perhaps
the
bottles
have
more
oomph
d
a
decent
drinker
tame
a
gentle
yet
still
pronounced
hop
aroma
and
appreciable
bitterness
but
very
light
on
the
typical
belgian
funk
this
belgian
pale
ale
pours
a
bright
golden
amber
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
starts
with
a
healthy
portion
of
pineapple
and
piney
hops
and
is
followed
by
some
citrus
fruits
and
then
in
the
background
some
belgian
yeast
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
nicely
with
plenty
of
citrus
hopiness
tropical
fruits
and
a
more
prominent
belgian
yeast
spiceyness
this
bpa
finishes
nicely
with
a
little
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
and
an
6

abv
i
paid
too
much
for
this
bottle
but
considering
how
good
it
is
i
cant
say
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
another
recommended
but
would
love
to
get
it
at
a
lower

omme
nice

nice

to

right
now
and
surely
as
part
of
some
enjoyable
summer
lunches
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
tried
recently
and
one
of
the
best
belgian

pours
a
hazy

with
billowy
suds
forming
two

three
fingers
high

then
quickly

a

some

quite

with
a
soft

delicate
mouthfeel
holding
some
tangerine

orange

phenols
finishing
with
the
slightest
prick

an
interesting
take
on
this
version
ommegang
sure
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
at
domestic
belgian
replications
and
this
is
a
solid
offering
best
way
i
can
explain
this
is
that
it
has
the
esters
of
a
tripel
and
the
phenols
of
a
witte
i
would
have
liked
for
this
to
have
been
a
little
cleaner
the
label
boasts
that
its
been
dry
hopped
with
cascade
yet
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
citrus
or
pine
on
the
end
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
i
get
brewing
in
subtleties
i
would
have
just
like
to
seen
a
bit
more
bite
here
nonetheless
a
refreshing
limited
offering
from
some
of
the
pioneers
of
belgium
brewing
in
america
overall
not
realizing
that
this
brewery
focuses
on
belgian
style
ales
i
saw
amber
ale
on
the
label
and
went
for
it
i
dont
know
why
this
is
classified
as
an
amber
ale
its
a
straightforward
belgian
pale
ale
if
you
ask
me
it
has
that
classic
belgian
spice
and
yeast
with
some
fruit
complexity
one
of
the
better
american
belgian
style
ales
iv
had
actually
overall
a
solid
beer
in
a
style
i
normally
wouldnt
seek
out
deep
copper
medium
lacing
thick
head
moderate
carbonation
taste
of
belgian
pale
and
hop
suggestions
of
apple
citrus
zest
allspice
cinnamon
and
floral
grassy
notes
can
all
be
parsed
alcohol
is
moderate
and
the
beer
closes
with
a
medium
balanced
finish
guess
its
the
east
just
not
a
big
fan
its
a
belgian
pale
or
an
amber
but
not
exactly
either
has
the
yeast
aroma
you
expect
from
ommegang
with
a
mix
of
clove
and
banana
on
the
nose
highly
carbonated
in
appearance
and
texture
which
is
juxtaposed
with
a
creaminess
that
i
found
rather
appealing
this
beers
maintains
a
thin
but
dense
head
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
little
to
no
hop
punch
this
is
malt
and
yeast
forward
beer
to
be
sure
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
in
general
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
perhaps
because
of
its
departure
from
the
style
belgian
ipa
is
what
they
call
it
i
get
that
its
more
sweet
than
hoppy
and
consequently
reads
like
a
mild
dubbel
deep
cognac
orange
color
with
heavy
head
slightly
boozy
and
sweet
banana
nose
after
warmed
in
a
snifter
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
taste
is
dominated
by
belgian
yeast
accents
of
pepper
and
coriander
and
a
general
slight
fruit
sweetness
it
was
hard
to
pinpoint
any
specific
sweet
flavors
in
this
pour
aftertase
is
belgian
yeast
and
slight
fruit
par
for
the
course
for
a
good
triple
one
of
my
favorite
beers
farther
from
amber
ale
than
expected
resembles
a
witbier
in
overall
character
and
taste
with
strong
yeast
overtones
not
much
on
the
nose

some

great

everything
from

great
brew
enjoyable
belgian
beer
done
by
one
of
the
best
in
the
business
ommegang
ommegang
never
ceases
to
amaze
rare
vos
pours
a
beautiful
orangegold
and
tastes
like
every
other
amber
ale
should
taste
its
not
a
beer
that
youll
shed
a
tear
over
but
it
stands
as
what
should
be
the
beer
all
other
beers
model
themselves
after
classic
belgian
style
ale
very
good
overall
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
style
ale
good
mix
of
spices
and
fruit
flavors
with
a
nice
touch
of
toasty
malt
this
is
a
goto
for
me
it
is
mellow
easy
drinking
citrus
notes
very
low
bitterness
it
has
a
touch
more
caramel
then
i
would
like
like
a
caramel
orange
which
is
different
but
it
is
really
good
with
food
it
did
a
bang
up
job
with
thai
spicy

very
very
tasty

notes
come
right
to
the
forefront
slight

feel
whilst
the
yeast
really
takes
over
overall
i
drank
a
glass
of
this
very
quickly
second
glass
not
so
much
lacked
a
bit
of
excitement
spices
too
much
like
a
clove
cigarette
overall
this
one
needs
some
improvement
in
the
mouthfeel
as
far
as
a
more
enjoyable
beer
however
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
is
top
of
the
list
i
find
this
beer
very
quaffable
overall
great
showing
from
one
of
the
best
craft
breweries
in
the
states
and
a
damn
good
belgian
one
at
that
a
beer
like
this
is
simply
not
an
exceptional
beer
at
least
not
for
me
that
being
said
in
the
realm
of
amber
ales
this
is
about
as
good
of
an
amber
ale
as
you
are
likely
to
have
it
retains
the
ease
of
consumption
of
the
style
while
taking
that
proprietary
house
yeast
in
the
belgian
style
and
bringing
something
new
to
an
amber
ale
it
removes
what
to
me
is
an
often
unpleasant
though
not
overwhelming
hoppiness
this
is
at
any
rate
an
great
beer
for
any
occasion
though
not
an
altogether
special
beer
use
this
instead
of
your
boring
amber
ales
for
a
party
and

o
a
nice
amber

is
somewhat
unique

set
it
apart
from
the
rest
o
a
nice
amber
with
hints
of
belgian
yeast
coming
through
a
great
change
of
pace
from
the
overhopped
amber
trend
o
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
taste
of
rare
vos
this
is
a
brew
ill
be
going
back
to
when
im
in
the
mood
for

a
belgian
twist
i
could
see
this
one
pairing
very
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
food
all
in
all
another
solid
beer
in
the
ommegang

taste
is
a
nice
balance
between
sweetness
and

a
bit
of
a
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
very
nice
belgian
style
thankfully
stopping
short
of
being
too
sweet
as
it
warms
the
hops
become
more
evident
and
the
dryness
of
the
finish
shows
really
well
done
o
amber
ales
even
belgianstyle
ones
arent
really
my
cup
of
tea
this
though
is
very
well
done
nuanced
and
subtle
yet
easy
to
drink
this
would
pair
fantastically
with
food
ill
have
to
pick
this
up
again
thats
for
damn
sure
o
quite
possibly
the
most
underrated
of
all
of
ommegangs
great
brews
i
know
they
miss
the
mark
on
occasions
with
some
releases
but
their
core
group
as
well
as
some
of
their
special
releases
are
all
top
notch
and
for
me
this
is
the
one
thats
overlooked
at
times
but
i
tell
you
this
may
be
ommegangs
best
overall
beer
it
goes
well
when
paired
with
about
anything
imaginable
and
is
very
drinkable
in
fact
its
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
all
day
long
in
any
season
of
the
year
here
is
my
tribute
to
rare
vos
the
remarkable
sly
fox
from
new
yorks
belgian
brewery
for
a
cafe
beer
the
abv
on
this
seems
a
little
high
id
like
to
think
they
could
make
this
beer
taste
the
same
at
more
of
a
witlevel
of
alcohol
still
this
is
a
tasty
far
from
oversweet
bpa
with
nice
notes
of
spice
certainly
a
good
daydrinking
beer
o
the
uniqueness
in
this
beer
has
always
been
its
bold
toastiness
nutty
malt
character
and
distinct
fruity
flavor
excellent
brew
especially
on
tap
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
quite
nice
mostly
caramel
with
apple
crispness
nice
light
crisp
mouthfeel
to
me
this
beer
is
quite
straightforward
but
does
a
very
good
job
of
it
i
got
brown
sugar
and
apples
right
off
the
bat
followed
quickly
by
the
belgian
yeast
very
clove
like
leaves
a
nice
clove
spice
on
your
palette
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
one
of
the
better
belgianstyle
beers
i
have
had
in
awhile
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
this
belgian
style
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
amber
hue
with
a
fluffy
lasting
white
head
that
leaves
beautiful
foamy
lacing
the
nose
is
dominated
by
caramel
malts
orange
coriander
pepper
and
belgiany
yeasty
funkiness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
effervescent
and
quite
rich
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
but
with
even
more
complexity
balance
and
depth
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
an
excellent
introduction
to
belgian
ales
for
those
strictly
used
to
american
offerings
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
not
outstanding
o
friendly
drinker
with
lots
of
flavor

original
review
on

home
tasting
750ml
into
tulip
22014
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
that
i
think
i
had
one
before
in
a
large
bottle
it
may
benefit
from
being
on
tap
or
corked
as
this
one
was
a12
oz
bottle
o
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
the
more
you
drank
the
more
you
knew
how
beautifully
crafted
it
was
the
caramel
malt
presence
in
the
flavor
added
a
rich
dimension
to
this
belgian
pale
i
cant
remember
experiencing
elsewhere
very
nice
o
second
time
around
with
this
one
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
id
buy
this
again
if
the
price
was
right
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
as
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
beers
in
general
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
rare
vos
was
extremely
well
balanced
in
terms
of
keeping
the
sugary
belgian
flavors
to
a
pleasant
minimum
i
didnt
feel
overwhelmed
by
these
sugars
and
felt
that
they
were
kept
in
check
by
a
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
m
medium
carbonation
medium
body
but
a
touch
chewy
also
the
initial
blast
of
carbonation
was
soda
like
but
it
quickly
calmed
down
overall
very
tasty
and
one
ive
returned
to
many
times
recommend
trying
o
solid
offering
from
ommegang
it
evaded
me
for
a
long
time
but
im
glad
i
finally
picked
a
bottle
up
for
the
price
tag
this
is
definitely
something
ill
be
buying
again
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
with
some
braised
pork
belly
it
pulls
fat
off
the
palate
excellently
pours
out
a
dark
amberorange
in
color
with
a
nice
three
finger
head
with
good
retention
smell
is
of
nice
belgian
yeast
bananas
and
cloves
a
little
fruity
in
the
nose
but
the
yeast
takes
the
forefront
here
taste
is
more
of
the
nice
belgian
yeast
and
what
was
in
the
nose
there
is
a
little
fruity
hops
with
a
great
aftertaste
that
includes
a
slight
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
i
really
love
the
belgian
yeast
so
this
is
all
win
for
me
mouthfeel
is
really
quite
thick
for
the
style
which
is
hard
to
do
and
keep
all
these
variables
together
in
such
a
nice
beer
really
a
nice
beer
that
i
havent
had
for
years
and
really
glad
i
tried
it
again
bought
a
few
of
the
ommegang
christmas
packs
so
am
regular
with
rare
vos
good
looking
beer
that
smells
very
good
very
tasty
one
of
the
better
ambers
like
the
beer
but
would
not
buy
on
its
own
but
would
certainly
buy
as
a
value
along
with
some
of
the
other
ommegang
beers
excellent
beer
but
not
a
great
buy
alone
o
overall
very
good
beer
excellent
belgian
style
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
would
definitely
purchase
again
and
share
with
friends
overall
this
is
yet
another
zesty
vibrant
drinkable
belgianstyle
ale
from
ommegang
this
would
be
dynamite
in
the
summer
or
spring
o
a
great
beer
for
my
500th
i
would
love
a
case
of
it
this
goes
in
to
my
top
10
o
its
a
well
made
beer
which
makes
me
wish
it
was
more
flavorful
than
it
was
it
is
a
dialed
back
version
of
a
belgian
dubbel
and
seemed
muted
o
a
superb
belgian
ale
with
spices
mine
paired
nicely
with
asian
crackers
and
spicy
ahi
poke
probably
better
suited
to
warmer
weather
but
good
anytime
this
beer
has
a
great
look
and
feel
but
is
lacking
in
taste
in
my
mind
needs
more
citrus
or
more
maltiness
to
keep
it
from
tasting
flat
i
love
ommegang
and
i
think
they
do
belgians
right
but
this
is
a
bit
lacking
for
me
wish
i
liked
it
more
ill
try
it
in
bottle
to
see
if
its
the
keg
but
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
beer
was
purchashed
on
tap
at
the
eagle
tavern
in
liverpool
ny
they
no
longer
have
it
on
tap
outstanding
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
all
of
the
beer
lovers
o
solid
beer
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
brace
yourself
for
an
overwhelming
spice
thing
outstanding
o
love
this
beer
for
its
somewhat
intense
bubble
gum
flavor
that
has
a
generous
dose
of
malt
and
yeastiness
is
that
a
word
dark
amber
color
with
one
finger
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
drinking
process
solid
lacing
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
a
bit
yeasty
to
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
fruit
tastes
great
i
mean
outstanding
the
balance
is
almost
perfect
it
goes
down
smooth
and
ends
with
a
fruity
hoppy
finish
the
aftertaste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
the
initial
flavor
is
exceptional
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
in
a
heartbeat
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
can
see
having
this
again
on
occasion
overall
its
goddamned
amazing
overall
a
great
belgian
style
amber
that
showcases
fruity
malt
character
tempered
by
belgian
yeast
spicy
and
earthiness
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
only
a
dollar
to
upgrade
from
a
budlight
and
worth
every
penny4
a
pint
14
a
pitcher
on
non
special
days
this
is
a
perfect
end
of
summer
beginning
of
fall
brew
fruity
enough
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
but
enough
spice
to
remind
one
that
the
leaves
are
changing
and
the
weather
is
becoming
cooler
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
this
again
and
highly
recommend
it
to
others
plus
at
6
5
abv
theres
enough
to
give
a
solid
buzz
but
not
so
much
that
it
would
be
unsafe
to
drive
after
ordering
another
overall
this
beer
perfects
what
it
sets
out
to
do
it
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
amber
ales
i
have
ever
tried
ommegang
continues
their
legacy
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
since
its
pretty
much
a
straight
forward
belgian
pale
ale
but
the
caramel
malts
add
a
little
something
extra
to
it
and
i
thought
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
since
i
think
the
carbonation
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
fruit
profile
in
the
aroma
and
taste
it
was
a
nice
mixture
of
fruits
that
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
know
this
style
is
suppose
to
have
a
higher
carbonation
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
out
of
control
i
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
not
very
often
and
i
think
it
might
go
well
with
food
and
its
not
too
over
priced
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
pale
ales
even
through
its
not
the
truest
to
style
it
still
has
most
of
the
key
attributes
that
define
this
style
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
wasnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
nice
and
a
little
unique
good
job
guys
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
thats
pretty
close
to
a
belgian
pale
ale
im
happy
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
o
a
highly
drinkable
belgian
style
amber
ale
liked
this
better
than
hennepin
though
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
them
side
by
side
three
philosophers
is
still
my
favorite
ommegang
of
the
four
i
have
tasted
so
far
because
of
its
relative
dark
maltiness
but
rare
vos
would
probably
be
second
to
that
and
the
superior
warm
weather
drink
very
different
brew
the
phenols
are
somewhat
offputting
and
the
buttery
toffee
caramel
base
dominates
the
high
carbonation
robs
the
mouth
of
the
flavor
too

impression
an
enjoyable

and
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
that
is
certainly
worth
the
taste
however
being
neither
altogether
crisp
and
refreshing
nor
very
satisfying
and
filling
it
left
a
bit
of
an
emptiness
in
my
belly
could
have
done
with
less
of
the
citrus

already

o
this
is
a

but
it
is
neither
an
outstanding
ommegang
nor
an
outstanding

it
is
still
worth
the
try
though
reasonably
priced
and
mildly
flavored
good
for
a
hot
long
day
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
this
beer
pours
a
reddish

with
a
little
haze
and
smells
mildly
fruity
orange
with
hints
of
spice
its
creamy
with
a

but
almost
no

good

and
the
taste
is

again
ommegang
has
the
made
the
perfect
dubbel
in
that
you
can
taste
no
alcohol
except
a
touch
in
the
finish
little
pepper
on
the
nose
and
its
a
little
on
the
thin
side
sweet
yeasty
malty
soft
on
the
carbonation
with
a
slightly
sticky
dry
finish
although
the
hops
are
not
up
front
on
the
palate
they
balance
nicely
with
the
malt
and
this
beer
is
very
delicious
without
tasting
too
heavy
ommegang
never
fails
to
delight
and
this
is
a
superb
and
contemporary
belgian
pale
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
a
great
belgian
pale
that
is
always
available
this
paired
very
well
with
roasted
quail
always
a
good
choice
on
its
own
or
with
food
the
taste
followed
the
smells
too
add
some
grain
feel
into
the
blend
this
was
an
easy
drinking
semisweet
brew
that
i
took
too
greatly
couldnt
have
another
though
too
many
others
to
try
o
a
four
or
sixpack
of
rare
vos
might
just
be
one
of
my
goto
beer
choices
from
now
on
and
whats
more
i
just
brewed
a
light
beer
with
orange
peel
so
this
is
a
perfect
archetype
that
i
can
look
at
my
missteps
with
hell
if
i
can
ever
make
a
beer
this
good
ill
quit
my
job

again
i
think
there
is
something
off
about
this
particular
bottle
of
a
beer
that
i
am
quite
familiar
with
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
it
almost
seems
like
a
sour
version
of
rare
vos
which
doesnt
work
quite
as
well
as
a
fresh
rare
vos
on
draft
o
enjoyed
this
beer
sometimes
spices
in
a
brew
can
be
a
bit
much
for
my
tastes
but
this
was
nice
very
well
done
could
definitely
unwind
with
a
few
of
these
one
of
the
better
belgian
pale
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
overall
nice
everyday
belgian
ale
but
the
6
5
abv
keeps
this
from
being
as
sessionable
as
it
tastes
however
i
guess
6
5
is
a
session
beer
for
belgians
o
just
getting
back
into
bpa
style
and
this
is
near
the
top
so
far
another
great
ommegang
yeah
this
is
a
good
one
overall
my
favorite
ommegang
brew
i
followed
their
pairing
directions
and
have
had
it
with
pub
food
pizza
wings
side
of
fries
or
onion
rings
it
really
is
a
easy
drinking
medium
alcohol
beer
that
is
great
at
home
or
out
at
your
favorite
bar
or
restaurant
a
nice
introductory
belgian
for
newcomers
to
the
various
belgian
styles
the
women
in
my
family
love
this
as
well
a
beer
for
everyone
really
and
ranks
in
my
top
10
favorite
ever
overall
another
treat
from
ommegang
goldenhued
with
an
orange
cast
the
frothy
head
fades
fairly
quickly
the
nose
concentrated
in
a
12oz
tulip
is
of
toffee
citrus
and
pepper
satisfyingly
affirmed
by
the
taste
the
beer
is
refreshingly
prickly
on
the
palate
this
sophisticated
blend
of
flavors
combined
with
a
relatively
modest
abv
makes
for
a
noteworthy
thirstquencher
and
an
able
accompaniment
to
a
piquant
meal
this
is
a
good
beer
the
belgian
note
are
prominent
and
the
flavours
work
a
really
sid
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
to
be
had
i
found
this
as
a
three
dollar
beer
pint
night
at
the
flying
saucer
what
a
difficult
name
to
remember
though
normally
5pint
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
sign
up
and
make
my
first
comment
the
smell
and
the
taste
remind
me
of
armangnac
or
calvados
or
perhaps
an
armenian
brandy
ill
start
saying
that
this
beer
is
a
winner
it
pours
as
a
beautiful
amber
beer
with
a
white
wellretained
neck
the
orange
peel
and
spices
are
absolutely
clear
it
is
so
great
the
palate
has
a
caramelized
malt
not
at
all
sweet
showing
wonderfully
expressed
pepperlike
tones
the
high
carbonation
and
the
hops
well
balanced
with
malt
and
spices
is
what
we
expect
from
the
style
the
aftertaste
brings
us
hops
and
pepper
what
a
wonderful
beer
perfect
for
a
more
intellectual
conversation
im
sure
the
6
5
abv
would
help
poured
into
an
ommegang
flute
glass
pours
a
coppery
golden
amber
with
a
three
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
pleasant
aroma
of
clove
peach
pear
and
citrus
fruit
light
banana
enticing
flavor
is
relatively
muted
compared
to
the
aroma
with
biscuit
malt
caramel
finishing
somewhat
dry
with
a
lingering
dry
caramel
aftertaste
with
hints
of
hops
medium
bodied
with
hints
of
creaminess
an
unusual
flavor
combination
that
is
well
integrated
so
that
individual
caramel
light
fruit
and
yeast
flavors
reveal
themselves
and
fade
away
during
the
taste
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
ale
as
i
have
all
of
ommegangs
offerings
o
amazing
try
it
overall
upon
coming
into
this
beer
i
was
told
great
things
by
beer
lovers
alike
i
did
come
into
this
with
an
open
mind
and
tried
to
stay
as
unbiased
as
possible
it
far
exceeded
my
expectations
the
overall
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
came
together
just
right
and
provided
me
with
a
texture
of
just
pure
belgian
style
beer
i
will
be
getting
this
beer
again
as
a
great
session
brew
and
would
totally
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
to
expand
into
the
belgian
beer
market
cheers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
enough
flavour
to
keep
me
interested
nice
caramel
straw
color
not
amber
smells
sweet
with
a
citrus
floral
elementalmost
like
a
hefeweizen
spicy
aftertaste
the
sweetness
coupled
with
the
citrus
element
work
well
it
grows
on
you
and
is
definitely
bittersweet
it
covers
a
majority
of
the
palate
bitter
sweet
citrus
spice
etc
decent
amount
of
carbonation
nice
summer
warm
weather
beer
oa
nice
complex
belgian
beer
that
i
could
sip
for
hours
lacks
some
yeast
on
the
palate
but
an
otherwise
tasty
brew
i
like
this
style
very
much
and
enjoyed
this
one
especially
the
aroma
and
the
rather
complex
flavor
profile
came
home
from
the
local
wine
store
and
had
three
bottles
of
beer
this
was
recommended
as
being
a
great
beer
and
i
am
enjoying
it
seems
a
bit
fizzy
or
is
it
yeasty
enjoyable
nonetheless
with
that
being
said
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
several
of
these
might
be
wrong
though
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
having
again
o
a
fine
session
beer
as
the
label
suggests
rare
vos
has
an
enjoyable
dry
malt
flavor
with
an
edge
of
spice
that
would
work
well
with
most
foods
since
it
is
not
clingy
or
too
heavy
it
is
enjoyable
in
more
than
one
doses
o
a
nice
bpa
that
should
not
go
overlooked
the
color
when
poured
was
reddish
copperamber
with
loads
of
tight
white
foam
and
lace
on
the
side
of
a
tulip
glass
make
sure
you
pour
slowly
or
youll
get
nothing
but
foam
the
aroma
was
of
yeast
spices
with
a
fruity
hint
the
taste
had
a
very
pleasant
carbonated
bittersweet
yeasty
flavor
with
spices
with
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
nice
combination
of
components
to
this
fine
belgium
amber
ale
another
winner
by
ommegang
brewing
co
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
moderate
intensity
which
somehow
manages
to
never
feel
fizzy
on
the
palate
but
still
completely
foam
up
as
it
moves
across
the
tongue
the
result
is
a
soft
and
foamy
redundant
i
know
mouthfeel
that
closes
out
quite
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
excellent
o
another
incredible
beer
from
ommegang
fairly
light
compared
to
other
ommegang
beers
that
ive
tried
but
its
a
great
beer
i
got
it
for
an
incredible
deal
normally
it
would
be
a
bit
more
expensive
but
i
would
say
it
is
worth
it
its
got
its
reputation
behind
it
recommended
by
for
everyone
superb
o
more
than
credible
us
version
of
this
belgian
style
o
this
would
be
a
fantastic
gateway
beer
for
someone
hesitant
to
wade
the
dark
waters
of
true
belgians
ommegang
keep
em
coming
there
is
a
funky
taste
to
it
but
its
not
overpowering
and
i
dont
hold
it
against
the
review
its
still
a
great
brew
and
one
i
will
recommend
750
ml
poured
into
a
ommengang
rare
vos
glass
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
head
had
been
2
fingers
thick
before
settling
to
a
tin
head
with
lots
of
side
cling
fair
amount
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
primary
aroma
was
a
yeasty
smell
with
a
hint
of
pepper
undertone
flavor
a
peppery
spice
with
a
finish
of
a
slight
hoppy
kick
felt
reaonable
in
the
mouth
a
bit
of
kick
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
texture
and
chew
overall
not
bad
but
the
low
abv
seemed
to
pack
a
more
of
a
punch
than
it
really
did
the
rest
quite
enjoyable
although
i
think
it
tastes
better
on
tap
i
dont
get
so
many
of
the
metallic
notes
as
i
do
from
the
bottle
o
really
good
bpa
the
smell
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
after
i
tasted
teh
abbey
ale
but
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
looks
really
awesome
in
a
snifter
overall
4
25
theres
a
reason
this
has
been
one
of
ommegangs
best
sellers
for
years
actually
several
reasons
it
has
a
fantastic
balance
of
depth
and
character
for
a
beer
its
sizeit
kind
of
reminds
me
of
what
a
baby
quad
might
taste
like
with
a
farmhouse
side
to
itand
yet
its
still
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
something
for
everyone
who
enjoys
belgian
styles
of
beer
rare
vos
is
a
winner
this
is
obviously
in
the
same
family
as
hennepin
similar
taste
profile
but
more
malty
very
balanced
and
just
an
excellent
beer

is
the
mosty
unidimensional
with
some
herbal

bland

up

moving
to
orange

citrus
otherwise
nothing
else
light
to
medium

and
moderate

i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
one
and
it
was
very
disappointing

this
brew
grows
on
me
with
every
sip
o
originally
i
gave
this
beer
a
3
5
but
now
its
in
the
high
4s
beer
has
refined
itself
and
also
my
pallet
has
probably
changed
as
well
overall
drinkability
a
very
nice
beer
i
can
see
why
people
rave
about
it
so
much
indeed
very
drinkable
sessionable
as
indicated
on
the
bottle
i
could
polish
one
of
these
off
easily
over
lunch
with
little
problem
and
would
not
mind
having
another
one
if
i
decided
to
not
have
a
session
definitely
one
to
get
again
pours
turbid
amber
with
a
quilt
of
fine
light
cream
foam
smells
of
stoney
amber
malts
some
herbal
hops
some
hints
of
metal
and
clay
flavor
is
all
crystal
malts
and
belgian
yeast
the
yeast
is
sweet
and
dirty
with
a
bit
of
apricot
essence
some
biscuit
in
the
malt
with
a
tea
flavor
and
some
more
metal
medium
on
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
a
soft
but
persistent
carb
and
a
slime
finish
decent
beer
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
would
be
great
to
have
lounging
outside
on
a
spring
day
i
could
easily
put
away
3
or
4
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
ah
it
was
an
alight
brew
and
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
really
go
to
on
great
occasion
more
than
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
this
is
somewhat
creamy
and
finishes
dry
it
is
unusual
to
find
both
qualities
in
one
beer
very
nicely
done
notes
this
beer
is
awesome
tasty
beyond
belief
the
fact
that
it
is
brewed
100
miles
away
and
is
cheap
is
just
an
extra
bonus
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
deep
orangered
copper
color
with
a
big
billowy
creamy
head
nose
is
faint
orange
and
coriander
taste
is
coriander
and
orange
peel
more
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
floral
on
the
finish
followed
by
coriander
and
clove
nice
balance
refreshing
with
just
right
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
has
enough
complexity
to
maintain
my
interest
yet
not
so
overdone
as
to
demand
my
attention
overall
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
very
approachable
brew
o
this
is
easily
one
fo
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
tart
crisp
and
complex
it
remains
fruity
and
light
and
lacks
the
rich
bready
malts
i
dont
care
for
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
as
a
bonus
it
is
perpetually
available
all
over
the
place
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
o
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
was
a
little
concerned
about
how
the
aroma
started
off
but
rare
vos
has
come
together
nicely
yet
another
ommegang
beer
ive
waited
too
long
to
try
hazy
amber
in
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
off
white
head
that
doesnt
appear
to
want
to
go
anywhere
the
smell
is
somewhat
mild
but
pleasant
with
peppery
spice
belgian
yeast
esters
and
a
touch
of
light
fruit
as
the
main
contributors
malt
aromas
a
muted
but
a
mild
bready
character
is
there
as
well
the
taste
is
also
largely
dominated
by
the
peppery
spicy
character
with
some
definitive
hop
bitterness
and
floral
flavors
in
there
as
well
the
base
of
the
beer
is
built
on
a
solid
somewhat
sweet
caramely
malt
which
provides
good
balance
for
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
also
quite
nice
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
that
leaves
just
a
touch
of
the
peppery
tingle
overall
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
while
i
feel
the
smell
could
be
a
bit
more
assertive
and
the
the
taste
may
be
just
short
of
great
this
is
still
pretty
good
a
very
nice
offering
from
ommegang
its
somewhat
of
a
crossover
belgianamber
something
ive
been
dying
to
try
from
a
brewery
like
this
ommegang
showcases
some
excellent
fruits
and
spices
with
just
the
right
amount
of
belgian
yeast
its
a
bit
tart
and
finishes
dry
the
reddish
orange
hue
is
also
quite
nice
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
takes
it
to
another
level
for
me
very
nice
poured
into
a
pint
glass
decanting
properly
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
yeast
sediment
pours
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
tall
soapy
eggshell
colored
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
there
are
lots
of
noticeable
tiny
bubbles
in
this
beer
the
belgian
yeast
aromas
hit
the
nose
first
delivering
fruity
notes
of
banana
and
apple
i
can
pick
up
some
biscuit
aromas
from
the
malt
theres
also
a
touch
of
citrus
the
flavors
follow
the
profile
of
a
typical
belgian
amber
the
yeast
brings
the
fruit
flavor
profiles
from
the
nose
like
that
banana
apple
and
citrus
theres
some
mild
spiciness
the
malt
provides
a
nice
backbone
for
this
beer
without
being
too
heavy
the
shot
of
beer
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
really
had
some
nice
belgian
yeast
flavor
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
good
overall
but
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
little
more
fruit
influence
and
a
bit
more
body
as
well
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
caramel
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
is
however
very
interesting
for
a
newbie
like
myself
quality
stuff
o
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
different
take
on
amber
ale
the
belgian
yeast
funk
is
at
just
the
right
amount
to
compliment
the
breadiness
and
the
sweet
caramel
malt
the
dried
fruit
flavors
were
also
a
pleasant
suprise
this
beer
has
a
complex
flavor
profile
but
all
of
the
flavors
work
together
to
create
a
very
pleasant
beer
drinking
experience
d
extremely
drinkable
with
low
alcohol
making
it
even
easier
to
drink
a
lot
vos
tasted
kind
of
bland
to
me
fresh
off
the
tap
but
10
or
so
minutes
in
the
flavor
just
came
together
making
me
smile
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
of
which
there
are
alot
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
towards
the
higher
side
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
ommegang
the
crisp
sweet
fruits
and
yeast
spice
dominate
a
little
too
much
making
it
felt
a
little
overly
sweet
and
almost
apple
juice
like
at
times
pretty
decent
tasting
and
easy
drinking
overall
but
i
like
their
bpa
a
lot
more
o
a
true
pale
ale
usually
the
belgian
characteristics
are
so
dominant
i
can
not
enjoy
the
hops

banana
and
apples
are
noticeable
right
away
a
sweet

delicious
malt
profile
that
compliments
the
light
belgian
yeast
front
pairs
perfectly
with
the
baconbit
cheddar
burger
that
sat
in
the
brooklyn
east
ipa
the
light
spiciness
does
wonders
to
reset
the
palate
from
the
burger
and
the
smokiness
of
the
spicy
sausage
wrapped
in
banana
peppers
this
ale
is
light
as
it
spritzes
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
acidity
toffeelike
malt
is
noted
in
the
aftertaste
the
taste
of
belgian
yeast
conquers
the
fruity
notes
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
ethanol
is
wellbalanced
and
completely
hidden
not
nearly
as
dry
as
some
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
it
leaves
me
satisfied
with
every
drink
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
ommegang
it
doesnt
have
that
overpowering
belgian
funk
that
often
accompanies
this
style
it
has
a
nice
flavor
and
is
easily
drinkable
its
worth
a
try

a

b
p
a
from

ill
have
another
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
and
is
a
great
version
of
the
style
fruity
spicy
yeasty
this
one
has
it
all
the
booze
factor
is
noticeable
to
a
degree
as
well
i
cant
honestly
say
its
my
favorite
type
of
beer
to
be
drinking
but
i
think
its
very
deserving
of
its
rating
would
i
drink
this
again
yes
but
id
drink
this
one
only
on
occasion
i
agree
with
the
website
that
this
would
add
a
little
something
to
a
saucy
meal
such
as
chili
overall
a
decent
but
not
spectacular
beer
i
would
like
to
revisit
it
sometime
though
o
a
nice
beer
but
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
when
i
was
finished
i
didnt
find
myself
wanting
more
note
drank
on
432012
o
a
strong
beer
to
be
sure
the
nose
and
flavor
are
so
different
from
each
other
that
it
seems
to
offer
a
lot
of
surprises
the
flavor
is
deep
and
rich
and
complex
definitely
a
beer
worth
checking
out
just
wished
i
had
read
the
label
in
more
detail
selected
it
based
upon
the
high
ba
scores
at
the
liquor
store
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
smells
are
of
belgian
yeast
esters
some
fruit
sugar
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
very
tingly
the
taste
is
pretty
good
lots
of
brown
sugar
caramel
nice
and
sweet
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
good
clarity
and
about
1
finger
of
white
head
big
big
banana
flavor
a
little
watery
but
kind
of
full
in
body
at
the
same
time
slightly
flat
some
deeper
malts
underlying
notes
of
caramel
works
well
with
the
banana
and
clove
pretty
unique
kind
of
like
a
belgian
amber
ale
flavors
are
well
blended
simple
yet
just
complex
enough
to
stay
interesting
finishes
clean
lingering
subtle
banana
after
taste
this
beer
could
use
some
body
work
though
the
flavors
could
definitely
hold
up
to
a
touch
more
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
great
also
medium
light
body
with
moderate
to
full
carbonation
i
had
this
before
but
after
a
much
stronger
tasting
beet
and
on
tap
i
much
prefer
it
now
overall

an
interesting
belgian
it
seems
both
complex
and
simple
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
to
see
how
i
feel
about
it
under
different
circumstances
move
along
this
is
not
the
bpa
youre
looking
for
oanother
solid
brew
from
ommegang
carbonation
was
at
a
good
level
and
it
was
nice
to
see
the
incorporation
of
amberred
ale
into
a
belgian
framework
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
have
had
many
times
i
think
that
it
actually
improves
some
with
aging
though
my
guess
is
that
aging
it
much
more
than
5
years
and
it
could
be
on
the
down
slope
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
for
me
light
to
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
no
real
notice
of
the
alcohol
very
drinkable
and
a
good
spin
on
an
amber
ale
o
well
made
but
rather
one
dimensional
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
bigger
and
more
distinctive
flavor
o
this
is
a
tasty
belgian
ale
though
leans
more
on
the
side
of
an
amber
with
the
hop
presence
coming
across
as
more
of
a
creeper
flavour
on
the
finish
worth
a
try
though
thanks
redliner8
exceptionally
delicious
and
highly
recommended
o
interesting
beer
i
like
the
spice
undertones
but
the
phenols
dont
quite
suit
me
just
another
really
nice
beer
from
ommegang
overall
pretty
good
offering
from
ommegang
the
overall
balance
of
the
flavors
and
the
foaminess
make
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
bpa
it
is
marketed
as
a
belgian
amber
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
quite
enjoy
from
brewery
ommegang
i
often
overlook
it
but
i
was
happy
to
see
such
a
good
beer
on
tap
next
to
a
wide
variety
of
more
common
beers
bmc
guinness
etc
went
very
well
with
my
roasted
half
duckling
good
stuff
hard
to
believe
this
is
not
made
in
belgium
complex
refreshing
and
delicious
o
a
very
interesting
bpa
almost
no
hops
but
super
fruity
and
malty
and
even
a
little
funky
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ambercopper
color
with
a
big
cap
of
offwhite
foam
the
tulip
glass
directed
the
yeasty
aroma
full
of
fruit
and
clove
spices
the
maltiness
of
the
aroma
transfers
on
to
the
palate
the
malt
is
biscuitlike
almost
crisp
in
nature
high
carbonation
leads
the
way
toward
a
bitter
and
spicy
finish
dry
and
refreshing
while
still
being
malty
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
is
pleasure
to
drink
overall
b
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
into
duvel
tulip
with
good
half
inch
head
and
smells
of
yeast
and
citrus
mmmm
sweet
yeasty
belgianlike
goodness
with
a
bit
of
orangey
citrusness
among
the
yeasty
floaters
very
very
good
example
of
belgian
style
brewed
in
the
states
great
mouthfeel
and
great
find
will
enjoy
this
fully
and
keep
my
eyes
out
for
more
from
ommegang
overall
im
not
finding
many
flaws
with
this
beer
its
just
a
damn
satisfying
easy
drinking
brew
this
beer
goes
down
good
with
a
jazzy
little
effort
like
grover
washingtons
winelight
or
mr
magic
overall
rare
vos
is
a
4
because
its
easily
accessible

and
it

really
well
during

that

had
this
at
a
restaurant
in
san
francisco
pours
an
amber
colour
with
a
finger
of
slightly
offwhite
head
some
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
quite
spicy
with
dark
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
very
dry
flavour
the
spices
come
through
even
more
in
the
aftertaste
nice
carbonation
level
another
good
beer
from
ommegang
highly
drinkable
this
may
be
my
favourite
ommegang
beer
that
ive
tried
to
date
a
pleasant
surprise
i
wished
i
picked
up
a
few
more
of
these
drinkability
is
quite
good
could
easily
have
downed
another
one
of
these
if
youre
hankering
for
a
good
belgian
brew
thats
easy
on
the
wallet
look
no
further
than
ommegang
their
stuff
isnt
quite
that
trappist
quality
but
its
as
close
as
youre
going
to
get
on
this
side
of
the
pond
its
has
a
nice
drinkablity
as
well
i
have
seen
some
bas
talk
this
brew
down
but
i
have
enjoyed
it
very
much
its
easy
to
drink
a
lower
abv
then
many
of
the
other
brew
in
the
style
drinks
very
creamy
and
smooth
the
flavors
also
come
together
so
well
that
allows
this
brew
to
pair
well
with
anything
this
was
a
great
brew
from
the
brewery
ommegang
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
the
bigger
version
of
this
brew
on
my
next
visit
to
the
beer
store
pours
hazy
deep
amber
to
glowing
red
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
fruity
and
light
to
medium
spicy
with
tones
of
sweet
yellow
apples
apricots
peaches
pineapples
overripe
pears
mild
white
pepper
coriander
and
light
hints
of
fresh
herbs
malt
and
hops
bring
tones
of
crispy
crackers
light
caramel
white
sugar
and
a
touch
of
flowers
and
grass
the
flavour
is
fruity
up
front
with
tones
of
citrus
but
there
is
also
some
notes
of
apples
and
apricots
undertones
of
grassy
bitter
hops
and
toastedcrackerlike
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
carbonated
and
round
light
sweet
and
near
medium
hoppy
bit
dry
the
aftertaste
is
earthy
and
grassy
bitter
medium
bodied
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
but
i
really
did
not
find
it
all
that
unique
or
interesting
also
for
me
the
spiciness
was
just
a
bit
overpowering
and
could
have
been
balanced
a
little
more
by
the
fruitiness
and
a
little
bigger
malt
presence
still
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
dits
really
not
a
fun
beer
to
drink
i
was
excited
for
it
to
be
done
with
soon
after
opening
it
the
plasticlike
taste
towards
the
finish
seems
to
grow
throughout
the
glass
this
is
definitely
not
something
ill
ever
be
getting
again
d
this
is
an
impressive
beer
much
like
everything
from
ommegang
i
am
regretting
passing
this
beer
up
so
many
times
it
goes
down
way
to
easy
i
wish
i
would
have
gotten
more
than
a
single
like
a
lot
of
other
belgians
this
beer
tastes
like
a
friend
invites
you
over
to
their
farm
and
lets
you
taste
beer
theyve
brewed
right
there
on
the
farm
a
warm
and
cozy
beer
that
tastes
good
on
a
cold
night
like
tonight
pours
reddish
amber
with
12
layer
white
foam
cloudy
active
bubbles
malty
smell
some
orange
hints
light
citrus
taste
very
mellow
candied
sugar
belgian
yeast
notes
but
in
background
little
bubbles
of
carbonation
create
a
buzz
if
you
look
for
it
good
flavor
easy
to
drink
another
solid
ommegang
offering
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
belgian
ale
but
it
is
just
not
quite
there
for
me
i
love
the
mouthfeel
and
the
aroma
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
spicy
and
lacks
that
nice
fresh
orchard
fruit
character
it
is
definitely
a
well
crafted
ale
but
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
better
examples
out
there
d
sweet
fruity
malty
and
spicy
just
what
youd
expect
out
of
the
style
and
a
great
example
of
it
not
my
favorite
beer
but
a
great
one
none
the
less
d
didnt
care
for
this
one
as
much
as
some
others
looks
nice
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
light
lacing
and
above
average
retention
aromas
are
very
enjoyable
although
light
a
bit
of
sweetness
with
standard
belgian
aromas
of
light
barnyard
that
became
more
pronounced
over
time
a
bit
of
citrus
and
sourness
the
beer
really
falls
flat
at
this
point
for
me
it
is
thin
with
very
subdued
flavours
a
bit
of
belgian
nature
comes
through
but
no
real
malt
although
the
beer
does
not
finish
dry
decent
beer
but
of
all
their
offerings
this
is
the
one
i
would
least
look
to
redrink
d
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
alcohol
was
well
hidden
taste
didnt
improve
with
warmth
pours
murky
and
orange
with
lots
of
foamy
head
smells
yeasty
with
lots
of
floral
hints
tastes
very
yeasty
and
belgiany
a
solid
but
not
necessarily
outstanding
beer
a
bit
of
hoppiness
but
nothing
too
crazy
a
thck
mouthfeel
thats
a
bit
rough
from
the
bitterness
overall
fairly
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
full
2
finger
head
mild
lacing
with
adequate
retention
the
nose
on
this
brew
is
a
little
sweet
with
dark
fruits
and
a
little
must
palate
is
complex
and
tasty
a
nice
bready
malt
backbone
with
some
spice
and
funk
from
the
yeast
and
some
sweet
candied
flavors
an
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
offering
worth
seeking
out
enjoying
then
seeking
out
again
m
great
mouthfeel
with
the
perfect
level
of
carbonation
tha
alcohol
is
not
noticed
very
well
balanced
and
while
this
brews
flavor
is
pretty
good
it
is
the
lack
of
off
flavors
tricky
to
control
with
certain
belgian
strains
that
makes
this
one
a
well
brewed
ale
very
drinkable
good
even
as
session
beer
great
with
food
i
plan
to
drink
many
more
in
the
future
the
price
wasnt
bad
at
all
for
such
a
high
quality
brew
great
stuff
d
i
could
do
a
bottle
of
this
my
self
would
have
no
problem
buying
again
this
beer
poured
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
large
lacing
head
smelt
of
spices
typical
of
a
good
beligin
beer
the
taste
was
a
bit
heavy
lots
of
spices
were
present
a
bit
malty
also
a
very
full
flavor
but
nothing
that
made
it
very
difficult
to
drink
everyone
could
enjoy
it
overall
i
found
this
beer
very
enjoyable
i
must
race
their
next
years
cyclocross
race
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
an
easy
to
drink
style
overall
d
more
of
a
sipper
than
quaffable
for
me
but
quite
enjoyable
the
color
is
amber
as
the
name
implies
with
a
tan
head
heavily
carbonated
and
bubbly
mostly
transparent
although
slightly
cloudy
the
smell
is
of
light
belgian
yeast
and
some
fruity
sweetness
taste
is
of
the
yeast
and
is
sweet
like
a
lighter
tripel
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
belgian
very
good
dgood
these
are
sold
in
both
4
packs
and
bombers
and
you
can
enjoy
it
in
either
capacity
beer
poured
a
caramel
color
with
a
large
frothy
head
aroma
was
coriander
orange
peel
grains
of
paradise
with
honeylike
malts
and
caramel
taste
was
very
sturdy
this
brew
will
not
be
overwhelmed
by
typical
bar
foods
sweetness
was
moderate
with
a
pleasant
balanced
spiciness
grainy
mouthfeel
was
thick
at
first
but
mellows
quickly
and
dissipates
on
the
palate
overall
an
excellent
beer
substantial
same
goes
with
the
bottle
perhaps
not
as
enjoyable
as
it
was
on
draft
but
a
good
beer
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
candied
sugar
and
some
fruit
like
pears
and
plums
good
complex
flavor
as
well
pale
malt
candied
sugar
spicey
yeast
and
a
slight
vinous
quality
somewhat
dry
finish
no
hint
of
alcohol
medium
body
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
bit
lackluster
a
decent
texture
is
salvageble
very
enjoyable
beer
from
ommegang
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
with
a
big
dose
of
pear
yeast
and
some
light
banana
there
is
a
very
very
small
amount
of
white
pepper
in
the
background
i
also
get
a
hint
of
stone
fruit
the
feel
is
somewhat
light
with
good
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
creaminess
this
drinks
quite
well
and
is
one
of
the
better
ommegang
brews
that
ive
had
pretty
solid
beer
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
a
great
way
to
round
off
a
solid
thanksgiving
dinner
rare
vos
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
huge
3
finger
head
it
took
two
pours
to
fit
in
the
pint
glass
despite
a
mild
pour
wow
the
aroma
often
i
have
to
put
my
nose
close
to
smell
the
beer
but
i
could
smell
the
aroma
of
spice
hops
fruit
and
yeast
as
i
poured
i
paired
rare
vos
with
thanksgiving
dinner
thank
you
beer
advocate
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
go
with
the
heavy
starches
poultry
and
gravy
the
fruit
spice
hops
and
yeast
balanced
out
the
heavy
meal
every
sip
was
pure
heaven
it
has
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
my
only
regret
is
that
i
had
only
1
bottle
to
go
with
dinner
rare
vos
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
style
beers
it
gives
up
some
of
the
weight
and
depth
of
its
counterparts
but
renders
itself
more
drinkable
and
still
keeps
your
palette
watering
for
more
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
filling
the
gap
between
witte
and
hennepin
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
worth
buying
d
love
to
drink
this
beer
great
medium
body
makes
this
a
good
one
to
drink
by
itself
really
love
the
deep
fruit
notes
makes
this
a
wonderful
beer
to
admire
and
enjoy
d
drinkability
is
high
moderately
low
abv
combined
with
a
complex
and
flavorful
taste
profile
keeps
this
one
in
my
hand
often
just
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
drinks
quickly
and
beautifully
d
very
easy
to
drink
the
bottle
was
gone
far
too
quickly
all
around
very
soldi
beer
d
very
smooth
beer
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
tastes
are
present
and
well
balanced
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
ommegang
but
this
beer
left
me
somewhat
disappointed
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
beautiful
glow
to
it
and
a
relatively
thin
white
head
slightly
tart
nose
but
fruity
with
pear
a
touch
of
lemon
a
light
dusting
of
clove
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
pleasant
the
taste
is
even
better
beautifully
balanced
with
nice
spicebox
and
fruit
notes
balanced
by
some
yeasty
breadiness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
more
pear
and
clove
but
everything
is
rather
restrained
rather
than
in
your
face
subtlety
can
be
a
good
think
the
finish
is
harmonious
union
of
the
pear
caramel
and
clove
without
being
very
sweet
slightly
on
the
carbonated
side
but
with
a
creamy
soft
fizz
to
it
very
nice
with
a
cheese
plate
and
quite
drinkable
lovely
the
overall
color
of
rare
vos
is
a
slightly
muted
orange
heading
in
the
direction
of
amber
the
wheat
content
of
the
beer
makes
it
cloudy
as
is
typically
seen
with
other
wheat
beers
but
seems
to
be
even
cloudier
than
most
the
smell
hold
citrus
notes
which
helps
the
beer
achieve
a
higher
level
of
drinkablilty
because
it
is
not
too
strong
of
a
wheat
taste
when
poured
out
of
the
bottle
it
produces
a
nice
fluffy
head
which
beatifully
compliments
the
color
of
the
brew
this
is
my
personal
favorite
of
the
original
ommegang
beers
and
is
a
must
try
in
my
book
for
anyone
seeking
a
quality
beer
i
like
this
beer
but
i
find
it
lacking
in
most
respects
i
don
know
maybe
i
just
cant
appreciate
it
for
itself
outside
the
shadow
of
ommegangs
abbey
ale
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
its
not
my
preferred
style
d
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
i
was
not
entirely
blown
away
by
it
that
being
said
i
most
certainly
enjoyed
it
and
would
not
hesitate
to
try
it
again
tasty
however
not
exactly
my
fav
genre
for
either
belgians
or
beer
in
general
definitely
quality
brew
doesnt
even
taste
like
6
5
overall
very
drinkable
not
great
but
worth
a
try
moderately
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
light
mouthfeel
without
being
thin
some
tartness
up
front
that
borders
on
sour
leading
to
banana
and
sweet
caramel
long
dry
peppery
finish
pleasantly
balanced
and
very
easydrinking
d
very
good
medium
to
medium
light
bodied
mouthfeel
after
the
initial
carbonation
passes
very
heavily
slanted
toward
the
malty
side
without
assertive
hops
somehow
even
by
decanting
and
not
pouring
the
sediment
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
hefeweizen
but
amber
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
and
raisinsdark
dried
fruit
quite
good
a
little
surprising
to
me
for
some
reason
will
have
to
come
back
to
this
from
time
to
time
d
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
that
being
said
by
ommegangs
standards
its
a
bit
of
a
let
down
id
recommend
this
beer
but
at
the
price
point
its
at
i
might
direct
them
to
some
of
ommegangs
other
offerings
quite
drinkable
though
with
little
notice
of
alcohol
hazy
amber
pour
with
a
moderate
creamy
head
really
yeasty
flavor
banana
bread
kind
of
bitter
faint
tropical
fruit
sweetness
kind
of
too
burdensome
and
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
but
a
bit
simple
to
be
considered
anything
special
not
bad
fine
highly
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
it
is
a
nice
steady
drinker
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
one
again
not
quite
overly
offensive
but
almost
vegetables
metal
and
white
bread
are
not
the
quite
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
dark
ale
or
any
beer
really
i
have
been
unimpressed
with
ommegang
and
rare
vos
is
no
different
i
remember
not
enjoying
it
a
while
ago
but
i
was
hoping
that
my
palate
just
wasnt
ready
for
it
yet
maybe
after
a
couple
more
years
ill
appreciate
this
brew
maybe
a
great
beer
overall
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
it
of
the
beers
from
ommegang
this
is
the
least
exciting
that
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
good
though
its
a
very
drinkable
albeit
somewhat
basic
brew
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
its
simple
and
drinkable
on
the
surface
with
oodles
of
complexity
below
the
surface
d
really
nice
this
is
a
solid
amber
belgian
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
again
for
sure
its
nice
to
split
over
dinner
or
share
with
friends
despite
a
damaged
cork
ommegang
impresses
with
the
sly
fox
i
forget
how
much
i
like
these
guys
until
i
drink
their
beers
drinkability
another
extremely
solid
and
tasty
belgian
from
ommegang
not
sure
how
this
is
the
first
time
ive
having
a
bottle
but
alas
im
hoping
to
visit
their
brewery
soon
since
im
not
too
far
away
qpr
heres
great
too
as
you
can
usually
find
this
for
around
6
or
7
if
not
cheaper
pours
a
hazy
orange
copper
color
with
a
staying
12
finger
head
it
looks
great
smell
is
fruit
spice
yeast
and
malt
taste
is
a
mix
of
dark
fruit
taste
with
some
lighter
fruits
also
it
sweet
with
spice
and
yeast
and
malt
in
the
background
some
pepper
and
nuts
balance
it
all
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
alot
of
sweet
fruit
and
malts
its
drinkable
and
very
recommended
the
only
thing
at
all
holding
the
drinkability
down
are
that
metallic
ring
and
a
faintly
harsh
prickly
alcohol
bite
my
suspicion
is
a
superfresh
bottle
of
this
would
be
rid
of
that
and
thus
several
notches
higher
ill
keep
my
eyes
open
for
a
newer
bottle
and
hope
to
adjust
later
even
as
is
still
quite
a
tasty
beer
nice
balance
of
toasted
and
nutty
malt
bready
yeast
and
herbal
hops
body
is
airy
but
substantial
abv
is
nicely
restrained
and
keeps
this
a
refreshing
beer
some
clovelike
yeast
spiciness
comes
out
as
it
warms
and
adds
another
layer
to
the
beer
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
which
is
nice
and
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
despite
the
prickly
carbonation
this
is
easily
the
best
belgian
amber
i
have
ever
had
too
bad
it
is
too
pricey
to
make
it
an
everyday
mellow
drinker
solid
beer
so
damn
easy
to
polish
off
a
750
by
myself
d
very
true
to
the
style
but
almost
disappointed
because
i
expected
something
more
very
drinkable
like
a
standard
craft
beer
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
great
to
introduce
to
those
that
are
familiar
with
the
style
d
not
very
drinkable
but
not
terrible
perhaps
after
the
abbey
ale
not
had
on
the
same
night
my
expectations
were
too
high
slightly
hazy
bright
copper
colorbrighter
than
expected
for
a
dark
ale
but
looks
like
a
refreshing
summer
brew
thatll
be
perfect
for
ending
a
hot
humid
day
in
brooklyn
brilliant
citrus
pulpy
fruit

with
a
slight
hint
of

nose

vanilla
great
carbonation
moderate
body
rolls
and
lingers
slightly
sweet
a
delicious
moderatebodied
summer
brew
that
riffs
on
the
style
adding
something
uniquely
refreshing
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
approachable
belgian
style
beer
the
color
and
taste
were
both
a
little
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
produced
an
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
the
taste
is
light
and
somewhat
subdued
it
finishes
slightly
sweet
but
unfortunately
leaves
me
wanting
more
jd
higher
carbo
and
well
rounded
belgian
amber
it
is
possible
that
this
particular
specimen
is
past
its
prime
the
date
is
missing
from
the
bottle
and
i
doubt
this
circulates
quickly
at
price
chopper
the
skunky
nose

and
only
a
kiss
of
peppery
spice
slightly
muddled
tasting
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
slight
lingering

a
slightly
complex
beer
that
comes
across
as
muddled
instead
of
flavroful

with
a
fluffy
beige
cap
good
head
retention
with
clumpy
sticky

of

quite
good
i
liked
the
combination
of
spice
and
malt
with
a
little
fruitiness
this
made
for
an
interesting
complexity
without
it
becoming
too
muddled
or
heavy
expect
a
good
balance
between
smooth
sweet
taste
and
an
underlying
hint
of
something
surprising
d
a
touch
above
a
session
ale
i
think
even
if
the
abv
were
low
it
still
would
be
far
from
sessionable
its
a
bit
rich
and
sweet
for
that
will
i
be
drinking
this
ever
again
i
doubt
it
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
for
me
to
get
past
that
amber
ale
flavor
profile
that
so
doesnt
excite
me
this
is
a
solid
beer
though
and
you
may
love
it
it
is
cheap
enough
that
it
is
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
take
on
a
belgian
beer
buy
again
no
pours
a
very
nice
looking
murky

with
very
frothy
beige

aroma
of
some
light

dark
fruit
hints
of
licorice
faint
leather
notes
of

is
very
much
the
same
with
small
notes
of
caramel
some
spiciness

feel
is
medium

with
fizzy

overall
a
very
nice
enjoyable
beer
d
i
would
normally
open
a
750ml
bottle
only
if
i
were
sharing
with
a
friend
or
two
this
time
however
im
glad
i
opened
this
bottle
of
rare
vos
for
myself
ive
enjoyed
everything
ive
tried
from
brewery
ommegang
and
rare
vos
has
proved
to
be
no
different
in
that
regard
ill
share
the
next
bottle
good
probably
tied
for
my
least
favorite
ommagang
beeralong
with
the
witte
i
dont
think
it
deserves
the
big
bottle
treatment
or
the
pricetag
as
its
just
an
everyday
soso
amber
in
a
flooded
market
though
even
then
it
seems
it
gets
a
decent
score
from
me
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
also
medium
this
beer
is
more
like
a
belgium
pale
ale
instead
of
a
dark
ale
i
am
going
to
rate
it
based
on
the
pale
ale
sideamber
ale
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
its
up
there
with
hennepin
in
my
opinion
this
will
probably
be
found
in
my
fridge
more
frequently
mouthfeel
is
nice
high
carbonation
swells
foam
up
in
the
mouth
in
a
luxurious
way
otherwise
the
body
of
the
beer
is
nice
thin
while
cold
but
it
thickens
as
it
warms
to
a
nice
smooth
texture
nice
beer
sampled
from
the
tall
bottle
on
june
1
2010
the
pour
is
a
murky
amber
color
with
about
two
inches
of
offwhite
fluffy
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
before
settling
down
the
aroma
is
an
inviting
spiced
malt
and
yeast
with
the
bottlefermented
exuberance
you
come
to
expect
from
a
belgian
style
abbey
ale
the
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
leads
to
a
mellow
but
slightly
bitter
flavor
with
a
soft
note
of
spiced
hoppiness
at
the
end
ommegang
does
an
excellen
job
emulating
the
style
and
this
is
just
as
good
as
if
not
better
than
an
import
drinkability
quite
high
everything
about
this
beer
is
really
solid
and
like
i
said
earlier
its
very
refreshing
and
will
likely
become
something
of
a
rotating
selection
in
my
fridge
during
the
warmer
months
it
also
doesnt
hurt
that
the
6
5
abv
isnt
outrageous
and
can
quaffed
over
time
and
not
be
too
harsh
notes
its
not
bad
but
it
sure
is
one
of
the
most
uninspiring
offerings
from
ommegang
generic
and
very
short
of
any
personality
or
roundness
to
make
it
noticeable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
orange
color
large
white
fluffy
head
and
good
lacing
lively
fizzy
carbonation
smell
is
a
bit
fruity
taste
is
the
same
with
some
spices
thrown
in
there
as
well
medium
body
sweet
slightly
chalky
finish
short
flavor
duration
completely
average
brew
overall
a
pleasant
version
of
the
style
i
had
this
beer
at
taco
mac
on
tap
wow
an
excellent
brew
it
had
a
perfect
amber
color
with
a
smell
of
fresh
hops
and
a
slight
sweet
smell
of
malts
the
taste
was
great
man
i
was
like
this
beer
is
actually
worth
7
especially
with
the
chalice
thanks
again
taco
mac
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
and
the
same
time
which
made
for
a
wonderful
drinkability
man
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
i
loved
it
though
i
have
not
yet
searched
for
it
in
the
store
easy
enough
to
drink
and
as
others
have
noted
wont
knock
you
back
for
a
belgian
with
the
low
abv
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
fairly
thick
collar
lively
active
carbonation
aroma
is
of
citrus
peel
orange
lemon
some
grapefruit
and
spice
coriander
1st
sip
brings
a
sharp
bite
of
lemonorange
peel
bitterness
with
a
note
of
spice
as
well
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
and
lively
from
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
very
good
beer
i
plan
to
have
plenty
on
hand
during
the
hot
summer
days
to
come
d
a
nice
mellow
belgian
amber
ale
not
too
spicy
or
intense
a
nice
session
type
belgian
that
wont
knock
you
out
half
way
through
its
reasonably
smooth
and
very
drinkable
its
not
necessarily
something
i
would
sit
and
drink
by
itself
but
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
food
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
pretty
clear
amber
with
a
fine
offwhite
head
i
did
not
get
much
but
this
was
doubtless
a
product
of
how
it
was
poured
sweetish
aroma
is
malty
and
strong
and
has
a
subtle
butterscotch
undertone
mouthfilling
flavor
is
yeasty
and
malty
and
has
a
fruity
undertone
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
tingly
fizzy
and
lively
d
better
than
anticipated
and
nearly
spectacular
would
pair
nicely
with
dinner
and
dessert
alike
or
have
it
with
an
appetizer
this
one
would
compliment
any
portion
of
a
meal
or
be
completely
satisfying
by
itself
very
well
crafted
a
tasty
beer
that
could
work
as
a
session
brew
or
a
dinner
pairing
very
drinkable
little
hint
of
alcohol
this
one
is
a
winner
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
ommegang
has
to
offer
d
quite
refreshing
but
certainly
still
feels
like
a
solid
belgian
beer
all
the
flavors
blend
quite
well
and
make
it
decently
drinkable
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
not
much
more
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
big
fluffy
light
tan
head
a
ton
of
cloves
in
the
aroma
with
as
much
orange
rind
presence
very
reminiscent
of
a
witbier
a
potpourri
of
herbal
flavors
and
spices
are
balanced
very
well
by
a
smooth
citrusy
sweet
malt
base
with
more
than
a
bit
of
heat
after
the
sip
buttery
and
bitter
on
the
finish
and
sufficiently
carbonated
all
the
while
drinkability
is
high
just
an
excellent
excellent
beer
drinkability
a
carefullycrafted
beer
with
a
great
balance
between
fruitiness
earthiness
and
spice
an
all
around
delicious
ommegang
offering
they
never
disappoint
d
this
is
a
very
versatile
beer
it
could
be
paired
with
food
or
just
sipped
by
itself
poured
from
a
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
about
three
inches
of
bubbley
head
strong
dark
fruits
and
yeast
scents
dark
amber
color
plum
prune
fruits
upfront
strong
yeast
biscuit
like
notes
the
taste
finishes
a
little
dry
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
for
the
flavor
very
drinkable
i
wont
have
much
problem
finishing
the
bottle
myself
going
well
with
some
slices
of
aged
provolone
it
is
an
easy
quaffer
very
much
like
an
unfiltered
palm
it
is
a
good
brew
d
a
very
well
made
beer
drinks
nicely
but
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
for
the
abv
definitely
worth
having
top
fermented
this
is
a
sublime
belgian
dark
ale
really
quite
different
from
others
ive
tried
well
balanced
and
flavorful
this
is
a
very
rustic
belgian
ale
almost
like
a
saison
and
a
wellbalanced
beer
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
wish
i
had
more
than
one
drinkability
quite
drinkable
indeed
i
would
call
the
flavor
very
good
though
not
outstanding
but
as
a
complete
package
it
is
a
tasty
treat
poured
from
a
750ml
cork
and
cage
bottle
into
a
stem
tulip
results
in
the
expected
frothy
white
head
that
subsides
after
a
while
to
leave
plenty
of
residue
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
strong
belgian
yeast
aroma
with
more
than
a
hint
of
barley
sugar
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
slightly
tangy
sweet
very
nice
strong
mouthfeel
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
for
sure
wouldnt
mind
ageing
one
for
a
year
for
comparison
d
a
nice
belgian
amber
id
have
another
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
sweet
but
muted
beer
is
medium
in
body
carbaontion
makes
the
body
seem
bigger
there
is
a
roasty
sugary
caramel
flavor
in
there
no
aftertaste
or
real
bitterness
overall
its
pretty
good
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
strain
taste
is
dry
and
crisp
sweetness
up
front
with
a
slightly
tart
and
tangy
middle
and
a
estery
yeasty
finish
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
belgian
ale
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
high
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
very
good
beer
just
short
of
an
a
i
would
get
this
again
though
medium
bodied
and
slightly
warming
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
wheat
and
malt
a
solid
offering
but
not
as
good
overall
as
the
other
ommegang
products
ive
enjoyed
in
the
past
d
pleasant
moderately
complex
but
not
too
strong
very
drinkable
d
as
i
get
further
down
the
glass
something
in
the
flavor
seems
to
be
making
it
a
bit
tougher
to
drink
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
still
pretty
refreshing
but
i
think
maybe
a
bit
to
sweet
once
the
glass
starts
going
down
drinkability
very
easy
to
quaff
this
beer
this
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
day
long
md
dry
with
light
carbonation
needs
a
little
more
sweetsmooth
for
me
but
this
beer
goes
down
easy
the
drinkability
on
the
beer
is
scary
i
found
myself
about
halfway
through
a
750
in
about
20
minutes
and
im
generally
of
the
sipping
over
a
long
period
type
of
drinker
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
great
combination
of
fruits
and
spices
that
makes
for
a
nice
light
belgian
style
ale
nothing
overwhelming
making
this
one
a
very
easy
drinker
finish
is
very
dry
almost
watery
and
a
bit
soapy
d
all
around
good
beer
easily
drinkable
and
pleasant
overall
a
very
nicely
done
belgian
dark
from
brewery
ommegang
pretty
damn
drinkable
too
especially
if
you
like
sweet
belgian
beers
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
in
a
night
just
because
of
the
sweetness
but
this
is
good
stuff
ill
get
it
again
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
i
had
just
stopped
into
the
cafe
to
try
duvel
green
but
ended
up
liking
the
house
beer
more
great
beer
for
relaxing
at
a
bar
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
balanced
brew
drinks
very
easy
a
top
notch
brew
from
ommegang
yet
again
as
you
can
probably
tell
i
greatly
enjoyed
rare
vos
i
can
tell
you
there
will
always
be
a
full
bottle
in
my
cellar
from
now
on
its
only
sour
note
is
aroma
md
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
expectional
ive
had
a
few
pints
of
these
at
a
bar
in
cooperstown
with
my
girlfriend
and
decided
it
was
one
of
the
most
sessionable
belgianstyle
ales
in
existence
it
is
a
good
brew
easy
to
drink
flavorful
and
it
goes
down
smooth
i
would
buy
it
again
without
hesitation
d
rare
vos
seems
to
be
a
tweener
it
could
be
a
session
brew
but
it
does
boast
an
above
average
abv
at
6
5
not
to
mention
a
complex
beer
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
not
drank
to
the
point
where
the
palate
and
everything
else
is
numb
this
beer
was
particularly
good
for
a
belgian
dark
ale
at
a
very
reasonable
price
i
must
say
at
6
5
abv
the
pour
on
this
one
was
an
excellent
spectacle
with
a
very
frothy
head
and
a
medium
amberbodied
finish
this
ale
has
kind
of
a
tartness
to
it
but
far
from
overbearing
and
a
good
compliment
to
its
natural
fruity
tones
despite
being
a
somewhat
bitter
beer
which
follows
the
trend
of
most
ales
it
is
quite
fruity
and
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
most
importantly
the
taste
for
the
rare
vos
is
decidedly
above
average
for
a
strong
amber
ale
d
easy
to
drink
and
much
different
than
i
was
expecting
a
rather
unique
beer
that
i
would
like
to
see
more
like
and
its
sessionable
to
boot
check
this
one
out
if
you
havnt
already
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
ommegangs
better
offerings
imo
a
great
rendition
of
the
style
md
mouthfeel
is
pretty
weak
for
the
style
thin
but
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
extremely
high
ive
never
had
a
beer
of
this
style
thats
more
drinkable
ive
had
most
of
the
offerings
from
ommegang
and
their
beer
has
lead
me
to
really
dig
in
and
begin
my
quest
in
beer
appreciation
so
i
cant
really
say
enough
good
things
about
their
family
of
beers
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
felt
this
beer
to
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
not
discerning
itself
as
a
dark
belgian
ale
or
an
amber
ale
the
citrus
flavors
would
have
been
better
supported
by
a
stronger
backbone
of
malt
character
not
a
bad
brew
but
lacking
in
some
key
areas
all
in
all
a
very
good
imitation
of
a
belgian
dark
but
it
is
a
noticeable
step
down
from
the
genuine
article
in
my
opinion
still
a
very
good
brew
though
d
at
6
5
this
belgian
like
they
are
intended
to
be
is
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
helps
but
the
esters
may
be
too
much
after
a
few
d
refreshing
and
delicious
drinkabilityoverall
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
entire
750ml
bottle
most
of
my
friends
arent
in
love
with
this
beer
but
i
actually
find
it
my
favorite
of
ommegangs
easy
to
find
stuff
it
always
has
a
place
in
my
fridge
for
semispecial
occasions
like
tuesdays
this
is
a
good
alternative
beer
for
a
hot
summers
day
i
am
drinking
this
in
december
and
finding
that
i
want
more
flavor
and
substance
at
the
moment
dvery
drinkable
especially
for
a
belgian
belgianstyled
brews
are
not
one
of
my
favorites
though
i
appreciate
the
craftmanship
that
goes
into
making
them
cosequently
i
usually
would
only
drink
one
of
them
but
i
could
see
myself
putting
back
2
of
this
one
impression
not
the
best
of
their
lot
but
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
to
get
interested
in
belgianstyle
ales
carbonation
is
high
it
is
easy
drinking
and
delicious
d
the
price
is
right
on
this
one
and
its
definitely
worthy
not
my
favorite
belgian
amber
but
not
my
least
favorite
either
this
would
be
a
great
companion
with
an
assortment
of
dishes
or
good
sheep
or
goat
cheese
like
that
great
dutch
legendairy
goat
gouday
if
it
goes
up
in
price
anytime
soon
it
probably
wont
be
worth
it
for
me
but
for
now
this
is
a
good
goto
belgianstyle
amber
from
this
side
of
the
pond
a
huge
tan
head
bellows
forth
boldly
off
a
medium
pour
rising
to
a
good
threefingers
then
tapering
off
slowly
leaving
a
borken
chunky
lace
behind
brew
color
is
amber
with
some
jagged
orange
hues
where
the
light
hits
big
sweet
malts
and
light
fruits
grapefruit
grape
orange
float
pleasantly
to
the
nose
a
little
candy
sweetness
lingers
underneath
among
some
slight
phenolic
activity
tastes
fruity
and
spicy
up
front
with
a
bitterness
that
works
in
almost
perfectly
toward
the
end
a
bit
of
tartness
is
noticed
as
well
as
some
taffy
disparate
characteristics
blended
well
to
push
the
taste
upwards
to
perfect
but
not
quite
as
the
finish
becomes
a
bit
weak
mouthfeel
lies
on
the
full
side
of
medium
and
this
one
goes
down
a
bit
dry
with
a
modicum
of
alcohol
heat
touching
the
back
of
the
throat
not
anything
like
most
american
ambers
but
better
aroma
is
spicey
fruity
belgian
yeast
and
orange
coriander
taste
parallels
aroma
with
fruity
spicey
phenols
and
great
toast
malt
compliment
effervescent
carbonation
adds
to
the
impression
of
a
very
delicate
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
not
have
a
problem
finishing
off
the
bottle
and
at
6
5
percent
i
could
easily
open
another
one
if
only
i
had
bought
an
extra
a
solid
americanbelgian
offering
f
very
clean
but
very
lingering
light
sweetness
a
little
syrupy
crisp
finish
almost
like
a
good
lager
or
bright
amber
ale
drinkability
a
nice
intro
beer
to
this
style
i
would
have
this
again
but
am
glad
i
got
a
smaller
single
as
opposed
to
a
bomber
decent
not
outstanding
this
is
interesting
but
not
for
me
something
that
is
worth
a
try
but
i
am
not
really
that
into
this
d
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
its
flavor
profile
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
dunkelweiss
even
though
this
isnt
one
the
spicy
clove
and
penetrating
carbonation
are
what
did
it
overall
im
really
glad
i
finally
picked
this
up
the
smell
is
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
great
super
smooth
this
beer
is
so
ridiculously
smooth
and
flavorful
that
it
really
is
a
glorious
representation
of
the
style
if
you
like
hopback
troegs
you
will
love
this
it
doesnt
have
the
hoppiness
of
the
troegs
but
has
so
much
character
anyway
you
need
this
seriously
d
really
nice
take
on
this
style
drinkability
is
good
an
easy
going
belgian
that
does
the
right
things
well
and
holds
back
on
the
right
things
just
as
well
nicely
crafted
cheers
drinkability
excellent
will
drink
it
again
just
had
my
first
one
freakin
awesome
dont
know
how
to
put
it
any
other
way
great
amber
color
nice
body
pours
with
a
great
head
no
aftertaste
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
and
balance
got
a
4
pack
for
about
9
not
too
bad
considering
the
overall
quality
of
this
beer
i
could
easily
knock
back
2
or
3
bottles
of
this
in
an
afternoon
and
possibly
come
back
for
a
4th
if
still
able
to
stand
d
a
superb
saison
rare
vos
is
definitely
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
im
realy
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
dan
easydrinking
amber
ale
with
a
nice
touch
of
belgian
influence
and
flavor
this
is
easy
and
smooth
enough
that
it
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
into
belgianstyle
flavors
please
give
this
a
try
and
enjoy
it
slowly
pours
a
clowdy
amber
with
thick
2
finger
head
big
bubbles
fade
quickly
to
a
lacey
half
finger
of
off
white
head
fruity
aroma
with
yeast
present
taste
is
filled
with
yeast
nearly
bread
like
but
has
a
fruit
character
akin
to
apples
smells
also
of
apples
and
spice
as
well
light
mouthfeel
and
mildly
warming
sweet
finish
overall
a
very
balanced
and
drinkable
belgianstyle
ale
very
versatile
for
pairing
with
foods
and
great
for
any
season
drinkability
this
is
outstanding
to
my
tastes
this
highly
drinkable
beer
is
meant
for
sipping
and
relaxing
but
i
can
also
see
that
it
should
go
well
with
dinner
or
even
to
follow
dinner
as
a
dessert
treat
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
have
more
than
one
of
both
tonight
and
in
the
future
d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
to
me
it
seems
like
a
less
horse
blanket
version
of
hennepin
refreshing
and
drinkable
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
a
bit
malty
nice
and
sharp
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
and
some
good
thick
flavors
overall
pretty
decent
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
ommegang
beer
pours
a
light
orangeamber
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
small
blanket
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
is
left
on
my
glass
as
i
drink
the
beer
this
one
is
appetizing
looking
but
doesnt
have
the
lacing
or
head
the
style
calls
for
smells
of
belgian
yeast
belgian
spices
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
maybe
some
citrus
i
find
the
smell
kind
of
weak
and
a
bit
overpowered
by
the
yeast
it
does
however
adhere
to
its
style
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
i
feel
like
there
is
a
better
balance
belgian
yeast
and
spices
with
some
malts
and
citrus
not
much
hop
presence
if
any
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
creamy
and
medium
body
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
tiny
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
alcohol
warming
was
not
bad
at
first
but
took
over
toward
the
end
of
the
beer
and
a
nice
thick
coating
on
the
mouth
all
in
all
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
it
has
a
great
taste
but
the
alcohol
and
spicyness
might
take
over
after
a
few
the
price
was
not
that
bad
either
i
feel
like
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
dark
ales
taste
but
the
weak
smell
and
appearance
keep
it
from
being
a
great
overall
belgian
dark
i
would
probably
buy
this
one
again
as
a
solid
belgian
dark
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
too
heavy
its
sweet
and
complex
its
a
good
sit
down
beer
d
a
really
effective
brew
with
the
perfect
combination
of
complexity
and
smooth
drinkability
pleasant
notes
of
clove
bananas
and
caramel
just
round
out
this
ale
making
it
smooth
and
enjoyable
whether
youre
coming
in
from
a
day
of
carving
up
the
slopes
or
in
the
backyard
grilling
some
steaks
for
dinner
a
rare
vos
is
a
great
addition
your
day
drinkability
a
decent
allpurpose
belgian
that
would
go
great
with
a
meaty
meal
or
just
a
session
i
have
not
been
disappointed
by
any
offering
from
this
brewery
and
the
rare
vos
keeps
their
record
intact
amber
somewhat
cloudy
pour
generous
head
that
falls
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
rich
spicy
complex
aroma
with
honey
clove
and
yeast
taste
is
a
little
bit
dubbel
a
little
bit
saison
a
good
balance
of
yeast
and
malt
with
just
a
enough
lingering
tang
to
keep
one
thinking
honey
citrus
and
spice
overtones
hops
bitterness
is
present
but
in
the
background
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
ommegang
spectrum
and
one
that
i
will
certainly
purchase
again
drinkability
a
fantastic
and
refreshing
belgian
style
beer
a
darker
beer
with
fruitiness
and
spice
and
all
for
the
right
price
i
just
wish
the
aroma
was
a
bit
stronger
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
has
a
mild
yeasty
aroma
taste
of
spices
and
yeast
good
flavored
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
enjoy
these
all
evening
overall
this
beer
makes
a
fine
choice
poured
a
slightly
dark
amber
with
a
fluffy
foamy
light
tan
head
out
of
a
750ml
bottle
ive
greatly
enjoyed
and
been
very
impressed
with
all
the
other
ommegang
beers
ive
tried
but
found
this
one
to
be
a
disapointment
smell
was
of
faint
clove
apple
and
banana
taste
was
similiar
minus
the
apple
after
everything
ive
had
from
ommegang
id
probably
attribute
my
displeasure
in
the
style
of
beer
rather
than
their
take
on
it
ive
just
not
had
an
amber
ale
ive
much
cared
for
i
would
be
happy
to
have
a
rare
vos
at
anytime
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
not
much
to
distinguish
this
from
other
quality
belgian
ales
a
highly
drinkable
brew
its
fresh
tastingsmooth
balanced
full
of
spice
mild
fruit
flavors
and
complex
aromas
well
done
cheers
pours
a
a
translucent
and
hazy
orangebrown
color
with
a
nice
fat
frothy
foam
head
that
consistently
stays
and
lines
the
glass
very
nicely
theres
constant
bubbling
action
radiating
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
rising
towards
the
top
the
aroma
is
very
limiting
in
my
opinion
i
can
only
find
the
typical
belgian
yeast
strain
odor
and
some
hints
of
fruitiness
nothing
more
the
taste
however
is
completely
the
opposite
at
first
taste
youre
hit
with
a
subtle
spiciness
and
orangecitrus
lingering
topped
off
by
the
breadiness
of
the
yeast
and
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
light
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
lines
the
inners
of
your
cheeks
and
along
the
top
surface
of
the
tongue
very
nice
the
drinkability
is
decently
high
easily
sharable
with
a
friend
or
two
drinks
very
well
great
smoothness
through
the
spices
and
yeasts
notes
another
great
one
from
ommegang
super
drinkable
not
overly
intense
yet
very
complex
rare
vos
is
a
good
allpurpose
beer
ill
finish
the
rest
of
this
22
ounce
bomber
with
a
dinner
suitable
for
a
sly
fox
medium
light
body
with
fair
carbonation
you
know
youve
got
something
going
on
but
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
how
you
drink
it
this
went
down
very
well
a
very
easy
drinker
if
you
are
into
the
style
6
5
might
surprise
you
but
you
dont
sense
the
alcohol
at
all
worth
trying
cheers
d
pretty
good
brew
that
hides
the
alc
content
well
very
drinkable
d
save
for
6
oz
i
had
the
whole
750
ml
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
towards
the
top
and
just
became
less
so
towards
the
end
the
yeast
sediment
began
to
increase
naturally
and
it
became
more
and
more
citrusy
this
may
not
be
the
most
complex
belgian
you
can
find
but
its
relative
simplicity
makes
it
an
important
part
of
the
ommegang
lineup
if
someone
was
not
very
familiar
with
belgians
i
would
certainly
start
them
with
this
and
not
abbey
ale
or
three
phils
this
beer
pours
out
a
caramel
amber
color
it
has
a
nice
white
head
that
lasted
malty
nose
mixed
with
cherry
and
clove
wow
hard
to
figure
out
very
complex
taste
is
nice
and
malty
mixed
with
sour
notes
sweet
notes
and
clove
great
balance
and
quite
complex
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
not
real
bitter
at
all
has
a
similar
texture
as
fuller
esb
ill
need
more
to
really
figure
this
one
out
would
buy
again
taste
is
pretty
light
and
refreshing
it
is
somewhat
sweet
but
theres
a
decent
amount
of
hops
and
bitterness
there
as
well
a
fair
amount
of
spiciness
not
strong
at
all
this
is
one
of
the
more
sessionable
belgianstyle
beers
ive
had
to
me
it
is
a
lighter
and
more
drinkable
version
of
the
heavy
hitting
trappist
styles
worth
trying
prost
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
nice
foamy
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
small
thin
line
aroma
of
malt
and
cloves
taste
is
of
cloves
and
spice
but
very
tame
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
ommegang
it
just
didnt
jump
out
at
me
with
any
significant
taste
or
flavors
also
it
seems
a
bit
watery
its
certainly
very
drinkible
but
not
the
best
ive
had
mellow
fruit
and
malt
w
balanced
hop
bitterness
medium
body
w
a
clean
finish
overall
a
very
refreshing
ale
some
mild
spice
isnt
overpowering
hazy
orange
complextion
with
solid
white
head
and
decent
carbonation
citrus
sourdough
and
pale
malts
this
is
not
a
belgian
dark
ale
by
the
way
but
a
belgian
pale
ale
at
best
slight
hops
and
touch
of
cedar
wood
and
caramel
finish
is
silky
and
spicy
with
everpresent
hop
structure
finish
is
a
tingly
on
the
nose
and
a
tad
watery
a
bit
tough
to
drink
just
on
the
finish
but
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
value
this
is
quite
easily
one
of
the
most
complex
and
interesting
beers
under
7
ive
ever
had
very
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
outstanding
poured
with
an
excellent
burnt
browncolored
head
dark
amber
color
with
patchy
lacing
on
the
sides
aromas
are
wicked
wicked
rich
in
citrus
grains
hints
of
toffee
maybe
even
caramel
i
liked
the
slight
sense
of
burnt
sweetness
to
the
drink
too
taste
has
a
great
great
sweetness
to
it
that
mixes
oranges
lemons
biscuity
grains
honey
and
even
syrup
carbonation
is
so
well
balanced
that
it
makes
the
drink
very
refreshing
but
smooth
at
the
same
time
complemented
with
the
flavor
and
the
aromas
this
is
one
gosh
darn
awesome
drink
cheers
drinkability
another
great
example
of
a
belgian
ale
from
ommegang
many
earthy
flavors
and
tons
of
complex
tastes
not
sure
it
should
be
labeled
a
dark
though
this
is
not
a
belgian
dark
ale
its
a
belgian
pale
that
said
its
decent
clove
and
cooked
apples
on
the
nose
banna
on
the
pallate
huge
amounts
of
bannana
with
clove
on
the
back
end
decent
beer
but
not
great
i
probaly
wont
be
haveing
it
again
this
stuff
is
so
relatively
cheap
its
definitely
worth
a
try
i
think
mine
was
5
or
6
bucks
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
hazy
orange
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
top
slight
lacing
nose
was
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
fruit
spices
bread
dough
and
wheat
mouth
was
tingly
and
slightly
hoppy
and
the
taste
picked
up
the
lead
of
the
nose
the
only
drawback
was
a
slight
watery
finish
but
not
enough
to
ruin
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
d
a
drikable
beer
pretty
straightforward
with
not
much
complexity
probably
a
little
more
dry
than
i
prefer
overall
not
my
favorite
from
brewery
ommegang
d
hell
yeah
this
beer
is
great
for
relaxing
almost
would
consider
it
a
session
ale
if
the
abv
werent
so
high
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
lots
of
good
flavors
that
dont
come
at
you
too
strongly
this
is
simply
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
im
thrilled
to
have
been
able
to
try
since
i
cant
get
much
ommegang
here
overall
i
have
to
be
honest
i
almost
didnt
want
to
buy
this
because
of
the
alcohol
content
of
only
6
5
but
since
it
was
cheap
5
00
i
couldnt
pass
it
up
im
glad
i
did
because
this
will
not
be
the
last
time
i
buy
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
very
impressive
i
have
come
to
expect
nothing
less
from
this
wonderful
brewery
just
enough
flavor
to
not
disappoint
me
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
much
more
unique
this
is
a
great
brewery
and
ive
never
been
disappointed
by
their
beer
but
this
one
didnt
meet
my
expectations
its
medium
bodied
verging
on
light
and
has
some
fruit
flavors
almost
like
an
apple
a
dry
apple
not
very
sweet
at
all
good
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
really
smooth
and
drinkable
and
could
be
a
great
session
beer
i
like
this
beer
i
was
just
hoping
it
would
be
even
better
d
solid
belgian
amber
ale
here
nothing
too
extraordinary
but
nothing
to
bitch
about
either
i
do
like
this
beer
very
much
but
i
think
i
like
a
couple
other
offerings
from
ommegang
a
bit
more
3
philosophers
and
hennepin
ommegang
rightfully
advertises
their
beers
ability
to
pair
amazingly
with
foods
indeed
they
do
i
havent
had
a
thanksgiving
or
easter
in
years
without
one
of
their
products
at
the
table
but
those
big
750ml
bottles
also
make
nice
treats
unto
themselves
ill
tell
you
from
experience
they
suit
a
good
book
a
breezy
spring
night
by
candles
or
the
company
of
good
friends
just
as
well
as
any
dish
you
can
think
of
very
tastey
and
easy
to
drink
i
wasnt
eating
anything
with
this
beer
but
i
suspect
it
would
pair
well
with
quite
a
bit
of
different
foods
the
carbonation
is
just
right
many
belgians
are
over
carbonated
and
tend
to
taste
sharper
than
they
should
the
alcohol
is
masked
so
well
that
6
5
is
mind
blowing
for
how
light
and
refreshing
the
beer
truly
is
i
must
say
this
is
was
a
great
pickup
on
my
part
and
i
will
buy
again
overall
mediumbodied
simple
and
complex
at
the
same
time
easy
to
drink
a
nice
session
ale
it
pours
out
an
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
foam
the
nose
is
pretty
unremarkable
to
me
as
it
all
seems
to
kind
of
blend
together
and
leaves
nothing
that
pulls
out
in
front
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
a
nice
blend
of
some
mild
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
as
it
is
silky
and
smooth
like
your
hair
after
conditioner
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
a
mild
attack
and
a
clean
finish
i
find
i
am
restraining
myself
because
while
this
beer
is
good
there
are
other
belgians
of
various
styles
that
i
feel
should
be
ranked
ahead
of
it
not
the
best
offering
from
brewery
ommegang
but
certainly
a
pleasing
easy
to
drink
darker
ale
a
750ml
bottle
shared
with
psycohops
and
brothercannon
poured
into
my
ithaca
shaker
glass
and
appears
a
clear
medium
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
of
dense
light
ecru
foam
the
foam
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
tastes
and
smells
of
ripe
fall
fruits
such
as
pears
and
green
apples
sweet
caramel
a
touch
of
spicy
yeast
and
black
peppercorns
this
belgian
ale
is
a
notch
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
and
quite
dry
one
of
the
better
offering
of
this
style
that
ive
had
overall
this
isnt
one
of
the
most
flavorful
belgian
darks
that
ive
had
but
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
belgianstyle
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
substance
that
doesnt
try
to
overpower
you
this
one
just
got
smoother
and
tastier
further
down
the
glass
the
taste
became
a
bit
more
tame
but
kept
all
the
qualities
that
make
it
a
great
beer
this
is
one
to
enjoy
outside
as
the
sun
is
just
about
to
set
or
in
the
dim
light
of
a
great
bar
this
upsets
me
because
i
love
ommegang
ill
track
down
another
bottle
and
try
this
one
again
when
i
can
ill
update
this
review
if
necessary
d
im
pretty
disappointed
by
this
i
dont
think
ill
pick
up
another
ontap
at
the
busy
bee
served
in
an
ommegang
chalice
a
crisp
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
was
sweet
malt
spice
and
yeast
the
taste
was
a
nice
dry
blend
of
sweet
fruits
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
nice
dryness
and
low
carbonation
this
has
always
been
an
interesting
beer
and
it
holds
up
to
that
on
draft
overall
i
think
this
is
wellbalanced
easytodrink
and
delicious
d
a
nice
beer
with
mild
flavors
that
could
be
a
good
crossover
beer
ommegang
has
better
offerings
however
the
value
is
still
good
like
most
of
their
brews

for

very
carbonated

not

carbonated
for
this
style
of
beer
definately
enough
to
get
your
tongue
tingly
good
amount
for
a
spicy
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
this
was
nice
in
a
somewhat
warm
afternoon
feel
and
drinkability
the
most
notable
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
extremely
dry
it
reminds
me
of
a
merlot
or
something
very
dry
and
not
quenching
at
all
carbonation
is
spritzy
and
coarse
in
my
opinion
the
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
of
the
beers
flavor
theres
little
enough
of
that
as
it
is
to
me
it
seems
as
if
im
drinking
tonic
water
the
body
is
thin
and
the
beer
is
close
enough
to
flavorless
that
it
bears
a
striking
resembelence
this
is
one
that
ill
not
be
buying
again
not
a
big
fan
at
all
this
one
does
nothing
for
me
dekonink
has
a
real
toned
down
amber
as
well
but
that
one
is
crafted
much
better
than
this
one
the
feel
is
right
and
its
got
a
nicer
flavor
sure
its
not
big
and
in
your
face
but
at
least
its
there
i
feel
that
this
one
is
just
too
weak
its
really
stretching
for
it
if
you
ask
me
nice
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
leading
to
a
smooth
substantial
feel
i
will
have
no
problem
polishing
this
750
off
which
is
a
nice
change
super
easy
drinking
i
think
i
could
handle
a
big
bottle
by
myself
i
had
some
hype
when
going
into
this
beer
i
expected
it
to
be
better
i
have
liked
most
of
the
brews
by
ommegang
this
one
for
me
fell
a
bit
short
of
par
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
that
almost
glows
like
an
ember
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
decent
retention
its
aromas
are
interesting
it
smells
very
minerally
almost
beachy
with
light
fruity
ethers
reminiscent
of
apricots
and
a
pleasant
natural
yeastiness
the
fact
that
all
of
these
aromas
are
present
and
yet
all
very
subtle
makes
this
beer
very
intriguing
ive
become
accustomed
to
belgianstyle
ales
practically
smacking
me
in
the
nose
and
jarring
my
tongue
with
their
intensity
but
this
beer
does
none
of
those
things
rare
vos
has
a
lot
of
finesse
its
flavors
are
complex
yet
gentle
its
fruity
notes
range
from
peaches
and
apricots
to
sour
strawberries
its
bitterness
is
best
described
as
unripened
fruit
rather
than
citrusy
piney
d
very
good
beer
and
great
to
drink
d
easy
and
satisfying
to
drink
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
even
at
6
5
you
would
not
even
know
that
its
that
high
if
it
was
not
printed
on
the
bottle
the
balanced
taste
and
thindry
body
make
it
a
good
candidate
for
having
a
few
drinkability
fantastic
beer
form
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
imho
a
great
beer
for
novices
and
veterans
alike
overall
a
good
light
belgian
ale
a

this
beer
is
really
really
enjoyable
and
im
disappointed
that
i
hadnt
tried
it
sooner
this
is
one
that
will
be
a
regular
at
my
house
d
very
nice
full
flavor
and
smooth
finishing
beer
definitely
a
sessionable
ale
the
not
so
high
alcohol
content
allows
for
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
hennepin
too
at
this
price
how
can
you
loose
one
of
the
greats
from
cooperstown
pours
amber
with
a
huge
white
head
first
pour
and
fair
lacings
aroma
is
dominated
by
yeast
taste
is
belgian
yeast
strain
sweet
malts
hint
of
bitter
hops
has
a
bit
of
boiled
ham
in
the
aftertaste
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
i
probably
wont
try
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
as
im
having
no
problem
putting
the
750
ml
bottle
away
d
ommegang
continues
to
impress
this
is
another
fine
offering
that
will
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
a
brewery
in
ny
that
continues
to
churn
out
wonderful
belgian
ales
overall
great
beer
would
recommend
this
one
for
sure
md
medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
still
not
a
session
beer
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
for
a
reasonable
price
overall
ommegang
has
disappointed
me
again
i
think
im
going
to
go
a
little
bit
out
of
my
way
from
now
on
to
avoid
ommegangs
brews
i
hate
to
drag
down
the
average
of
this
wellranked
beer
but
its
just
unoriginal
and
not
at
all
memorable
in
a
unique
way
fizzy
mouthfeel
though
d
very
drinkable
this
stuff
is
waaay
smooth
i
really
liked
this
one
it
doesnt
have
a
real
strong
alcohol
presence
so
it
goes
down
really
easy
reminds
me
of
a
mild
sherrybrandy
pretty
good
stuff
i
dont
think
i
would
actively
seek
this
out
and
it
wont
make
my
six
pack
club
but
good
no
less
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
12
inch
head
with
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
earthy
malts
theres
a
lot
of
hops
noticeable
fits
the
style
since
it
has
a
wide
array
of
possible
flavors
smooth
crisp
mouth
feel
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
lots
of
hops
the
bitterness
level
is
strong
but
not
too
overpowering
overall
another
really
yummy
beer
from
ommegang
definitely
worth
a
try
good
drinkable
spicy
ale
the
belgian
yeast
is
the
key
taste
here
relatively
thin
with
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
the
hop
flavor
only
shows
up
at
the
end
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
the
beer
is
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
good
to
moderate
lacing
im
always
a
little
bit
suspect
of
small
bottles
of
beers
that
i
almost
always
see
in
large
bottles
so
the
small
bottle
could
be
the
problem
here
that
might
make
no
sense
if
i
knew
a
bit
more
about
brewing
but
i
can
only
report
what
i
see
and
i
saw
a
head
dissipate
very
rapidly
anyway
the
smell
is
spicy
and
belgian
its
a
little
muted
but
there
are
good
notes
of
dough
coriander
earth
and
light
fruit
maybe
apricots
the
taste
is
quite
good
and
a
bit
of
an
improvement
on
the
aroma
some
lemon
flavor
makes
itself
known
along
with
more
spicing
and
some
background
caramel
the
feel
is
sparkly
and
nice
but
it
gets
a
tad
sticky
in
an
odd
way
the
finish
is
just
a
bit
watery
sticky
rather
than
full
sticky
if
that
makes
any
sense
i
keep
trying
to
like
ommegang
more
but
this
one
doesnt
quite
have
me
on
the
bandwagon
as
much
as
i
would
like
overall
im
starting
to
really
like
ommegangs
lineup
of
beers
this
is
another
solid
offering
i
picked
up
a
750ml
bottle
in
whole
foods
pours
a
lighter
shade
of
amber
into
my
ommegang
glass
has
a
real
thick
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
before
settling
into
a
thinner
ring
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
fruit
orange
spice
and
light
malt
i
can
also
smell
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
its
got
a
nice
spicy
taste
to
it
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
not
a
whole
lot
of
bitternes
to
this
one
its
crisp
and
dry
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
rather
fizzy
but
easy
to
drink
i
will
most
certainly
buy
another
bottle
d
a
good
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
finally
tried
i
certainly
wouldve
liked
this
better
with
a
softer
carbonation
and
perhaps
a
touch
more
sweetness
but
its
still
an
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
offering

ommegang

d
very

i

ill
have
another
glass
cloudy
orange
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
that
stays
at
a
quarter
of
an
inch
aroma

is
an

i
usually
dont
agree
with
the

but
in
this

i
completely
agree
very
good
and
worth
every
bit
of
the
4
pack
i
got
for
9

highly
recommended
and
would
gladly
puirchase
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
craving
for
more
while
the

of
juicy
oranges
with
pungent
spices
leaves
another
glass
or
two
sounding
like
a
good
idea
poured
a

in
my
snifter
the
head
came
on
strong
but
was
gone
in

hung
on
and
lasted

no
leather
tobacco
and
other
such
like
comparisons
the
beer
cognescenti
refer
to
we
home
brewers
and
winemakers
know
about
esters
the
nice
carbonation
makes
for
lots
of
bite
but
leaves
a
smooth
foamy
mouthfeel
after
each
swallow
hops
are
just
right
you
know
they
exist
but
youre
not
left
with
the
bitterness
of
ommegangs

all
in
all
a
very
nice
ale
one
ill
drink
many
times
over
as
long
as
i
have

be
drinking

seems

part
of
this
disapointing
offering
ommegang
has
impressed
me
over
and
overthis
one
just
didnt
do
it
i
will
try
this
again
just
to
see
if
this
was
a
fluke
a

bitter
dry

did
this
no
favors
either

poured

with

a
twofinger

smell
starts
off
with

after
that
the

kick
in
including
some

the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick

medium
carbonation

ends
in
a
little
dryness
this
is
not
necessarily
the
most
drinkable
beer
as

as
quantity
but
its
definitely
one
that
will
make
you
think
about
what
youre

constantly
shifting

is
perfect
for
the
large

i
bought
it
in

if
you
can
get

on

a
testament
to
the
impact

and
it

good
d
this
is
a
pleasant
good
drinking
beer
but
just
a
little
simpler
than
i
expected
d
this
has
been
my
goto
thanksgiving
beer
for
about
five
years
now
and
its
never
let
me
or
anyone
else
partaking
down
well
rounded
and
fullbodied
yet
tame
enough
to
act
as
a
sympathetic
character
allowing
the
savory
flavors
of
the
meal
to
shine
through
so
easy
and
so
delicious
i
poured
a
12
ounce
beer
into
a
tulip
glass
this
is
a
very
pretty
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
an
impresive
white
head
as
the
head
recedes
it
leaves
little
lacing
but
a
thin
froth
remains
on
top
the
smell
is
of
slightly
sour
cherries
the
first
sip
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
sour
cherry
finish
and
the
finish
lingers
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
is
a
pleasant
sipper
after
touring
the
brewery
we
learned
that
bottle
conditioning
does
not
apply
to
kegs
so
this
is
reallya
different
experience
than
this
brew
in
the
bottle
maybe
less
complex
but
a
fabulously
refreshinga
nd
gloriously
tangy
spicy
brew
grains
of
paradise
it
turns
out
very
balanced
a
winner
this
beer
leaves
me
fairly
neutral
but
reading
through
others
reviews
it
is
clear
that
many
hold
rare
vos
in
much
higher
regards
than
i
can
understand
to
my
palate
this
never
materialized
as
a
lifealtering
scrumptious
beer
on
one
hand
its
just
another
belgianinfluenced
ale
lacking
the
oomph
the
complexity
the
tight
balance
that
makes
a
good
beer
great
and
yet
on
the
other
it
is
a
good
solid
ale
nothing
special
cheers
d
the
relatively
low
alcohol
refreshing
carbonation
and
interesting
flavor
makes
this
something
i
could
enjoy
many
of
d
a
good
brew
this
is
a
bit
of
a
wide
open
style
so
i
didnt
have
any
preconceived
expectations
that
said
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
bitter
and
noseless
i
bought
this
bottle
mostly
too
harvest
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
to
make
a
tripel
that
being
said
i
have
avoided
buying
this
particular
beer
before
and
it
was
stupid
to
do
so
this
is
great
pairing
it
with
a
nice
rib
eye
and
a
simple
salad
pours
a
light
amber
think
falling
leaves
with
a
active
dancing
head
the
carbonation
keeps
going
strong
in
the
mouth
and
tastes
great
while
doing
it
a
good
strong
belgian
i
only
hope
my
beer
made
with
the
yeast
is
half
as
good
drinkability
is
moderate
im
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
body
isnt
working
for
me
and
the
flavor
profile
is
weak
decent
but
subpar
imo
enthusiastically
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone

this

iis
for

a

on

list
d

i
could
easily
drink
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
from
which
this
came
in
a
session
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
it
is
a
smooth
sweet
and
spicy
sip
that
offers
a
slight
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
that
may
have
been
more
due
to
the
serving
temp
the
nose
advertised
the
taste
well
the
bread
came
through
more
in
the
finish
it
was
a
full
thick
mouthfeel
i
served
this
after
it
had
been
out
of
the
cooler
for
about
an
hour
i
felt
this
opened
up
the
beers
flavor
rather
than
serving
it
straight
from
the
cooler
pours
a

a
thick

that

like

followed

rethink
rare
vos
is
a
complex
beer
that
chllenges
and
rewardsexcellent
as
always
ommegang
brings
a
fantastic
belgian
style
beer
to
the
table
at
half
the
price
dont
drink
and
review
d
the
texture
and
flavors
make
this
one
a
prime
target
to
session
hits
you
pretty
hard
for
only
6
5
too
overall
this
is
a
remarkable
showing
by
ommegang
a
nice
light
belgian
that
does
not
lack
on
taste
or
character
the
6
5
definitely
keeps
this
from
being
a
sessionable
brew
unless
your
name
is
andre
roussimoff
but
at
5
99
for
a
750
ml
bottle
this
sure
as
shit
beats
a
trip
to
belgium
or
cooperstown
for
that
matter
a
great
beer
at
great
price
you
really
cant
beat
it
from
the
first
sniff
to
the
last
swallow
this
is
a
toptobottom
classic
like
a
cuban
cigar
amidst
the
swirling
of
autumn
leaves
so
i
was
at
an
oktoberfest
last
night
and
i
took
place
in
a
keg
tossing
competition
and
i
won
this
was
my
prize
so
we
popped
it
opened
and
tried
it
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
on
this
beer
with
hints
of
bananas
and
apples
the
taste
most
reminds
me
of
an
apple
crisp
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
level
seemed
correct
i
drinkable
brew
wouldnt
be
an
all
nighter
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
what
i
had
poured
into
my
chimay
chalice
and
produced
a
one
finger
head
that
turned
into
a
small
island
of
foam
in
the
center
of
my
vessel
the
smell
of
some
kind
of
fruit
apple
melon
fresh
cut
grass
taste
of
said
fruitness
with
some
spice
coriander
clove
some
sweet
like
malts
the
carbonation
keeps
rising
into
the
center
of
my
chalice
and
to
the
center
of
my
tongue
another
great
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
taste
is
spicy
but
mellow
with
a
slight
metallic
taste
as
it
warms
it
becomes
more
fruity
again
like
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
this
is
an
easy
drinker
that
flavors
up
as
it
warms
excellent
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
ale
yet
another
outstanding
brew
from
the
brewery
ommegang
very
good
beer
over
all
would
definitely
recommend
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
belgian
brews

offwhite

that
is

dries
out
at
the

and
is
kinda
yeasty
light
to
medium

light
carbonation
limited

and
light
on

overall
on
par
with
ommegang
offerings
not
particularly
special
poured
this
into
a

color
with
a
thin

that
settles

faintly

mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
with

flavor
is
nice
and
abv
is

making
this
a
easily
drinkable
brew
the
finish
is
a
little
short
and
a
light
bitter
hop
spiciness
can
be
detected
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
perfect
i
just
mowed
the
lawn
and
would
like
a
quality
beer
to
cool
off
beer
i
would
not
walk
into
this
one
expected
huge
flavor
or
even
memorable
characteristics
i
am
expecting
more
from
the
other
ommegang
beers
but
overall
rare
vos
is
not
too
bad
not
my
favorite
ommegang
though
i
havent
tried
them
all
but
that
aint
saying
much
because
i
consistently
prefer
their
output
head
and
shoulders
over
almost
any
other
american
brewery
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
belgian
ale
not
a
real
powerhouse
of
flavors
but
that
fits
well
here
this
is
a
nice
subtle
and
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
buy
this
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
gets
a
bit
monotonous
in
the
long
run
d
this
is
a
tasty
dark
belgianstyle
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
cheapest
750s
youre
going
to
see
in
the
store
that
alone
demands
a
repurchase
at
some
point
good
beer
d
very
refreshing
and
the
abv
is
in
check
so
this
gets
high
marks
in
my
book
this
is
a
food
friendly
tasty
brown
ale
d
cant
believe
ive
waited
so
long
to
try
this
beer
im
definitely
grabbing
more
and
soon
clean
and
fresh
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
if
you
are
up
for
it

a
thick

some

there
too
its

has
a

and
the
liquid
is

very
easy
to
drink

good

this
beer
went
great

nothing
extradonary
but
a
very
quaffable
affordable
belgian
style
brew
poured
a
orangish
ruby
tinted

with
minimal

but
left
it
there
because
of

good
strong
swwet

with
some
citric
notes
mostly
orange

and
some

smooth

this
beer
has
a
crisp

taste
that
is
spicy

also
contains
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
and
was
slighty
cheweydoughey
a
nutty
dry
backbite
complements
the
beer
as
it
goes
down
and
this
is
a
nice
belgian
that
i
could
relax
with
all
day
while
watching
college
football
which
i
am
doing
now
east
drinking
beer
much
enjoyed
d
fairly
high
a
nice
one
to
bring
to
dinner
with
friends
and
family
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
generous
offwhite
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
it
really
does
have
a
great
look

it

was
faint

pleasant
subtle
hops
malts
with
a
sweet
spiciness

it
theres
not
a

of

its
good
for
the
summer
somewhat
spicy
with
floral
notes

a
mild

and
some
yeast
very
smooth
and
a
pretty

aroma
fruity
spicy
yeast
is
clearly
present
in
the
flavour
along
with
some
bready
malts
seemed
quite
aggressively
carbonated
and
along
with
the
yeast
profile
it
reminded
me
somewhat
of
unibroue
clingy
tan
head
with
delicate
bubbles
great
retention
and
good
lacing
orange
or
amber
color
like
a
midwest
sunset
aroma
of
sweets
fruits
and
rich
soil
great
flavors
displaying
much
depth
like
an
aged
wine
tropical
fruits
and
exotic
spices
cloves
mango
white
pepper
fermented
grapes
light
carbonation
dry
finish
with
a
crisp
nip
velvety
smooth
and
the
sweet
character
does
not
cloy
the
intriguing
flavors
clearly
a
quality
brew
did
have
another
later
with
dinner
a
good
attempt
by
an
american
brewery
at
a
belgian
style
they
succeed
very
well
in
recreating
the
style
id
reccomend
it
medium
in
body
and
slick
with
fine
subtle
carbonation
that
works
very
well
to
lighten
and
freshen
rare
vos
superb
drinkability
pours
amber
in
color
with
reddish
hues
an
impressive
two
inch
head
forms
on
the
pour
and
manages
to
stick
around
for
awhile
smell
is
yeasty
bready
and
a
bit
musty
taste
is
more
of
they
yeasty
and
bready
experience
but
theres
a
slight
metallic
flavor
as
well
not
sure
where
that
is
coming
from
very
highly
carbonated
ill
let
this
one
sit
for
awhile
and
warm
up
hopefully
the
carbonation
will
die
down
a
bit
decent
beer
but
not
overly
complex
by
any
means
this
came
across
as
a
nice
example
of
a
belgium
amber
even
though
im
relatively
new
to
the
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
pour
was
an
intense
copper
with
abundant
head
and
lacing
both
of
which
lasted
for
the
entire
experience
constant
carbonation
is
visible
the
aroma
came
across
similar
to
other
belgian
styles
that
i
have
had
in
fact
it
smelled
similar
to
a
saison
i
believe
it
is
the
yeast
that
produces
this
unique
aroma
and
flavor
somewhat
spicy
and
hoppy
there
was
a
definite
presence
of
sweet
malts
perhaps
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
is
good
although
a
bit
weak
in
my
opinion
when
compared
to
the
aroma
malty
with
nice
overtones
of
spices
and
fruits
there
is
a
well
deserved
hop
finish
in
the
flavor
that
is
especially
nice
tasty
and
complex
a
truly
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
that
i
am
downing
with
supreme
please
quite
tasty
though
not
super
complex
but
the
carbonationfeel
rivals
belgian
productions
drinkability
had
the
dunkelweizen
at
piece
brewpub
again
last
night
that
was
far
superior
to
this
one
on
the
drinkability
scale
good
but
id
take
the
hennepin
over
this
one
any
day
an
enjoyable
nightcap
to
800
miles
of
driving
over
a
twelve
hour
span
ommegang
continues
to
please
drinkability
wasnt
bad
i
do
suggest
letting
this
one
warm
slightly
to
bring
our
more
of
the
flavors
not
as
complex
or
as
strong
as
other
beers
of
this
type
ive
had
but
has
enough
going
for
it
to
make
it
a
nice
beer
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
if
offered
it
would
gladly
drink
more
taste
this
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
belgian
dubbel
with
many
of
the
fruity
brown
sugary
characteristics
of
the
style
maltiness
comes
in
the
form
of
biscuits
but
blended
much
like
a
fig
newton
sweet
but
in
no
way
cloying
and
nicely
balanced
throughout
midpalate
in
nicely
spicy
with
cinnamon
and
clove
finishes
spiced
again
with
more
fruit
notes
a
good
interpretation
of
a
belgian
style
by
an
american
brewery
actually
tastes
belgian
refreshing
d
notesthis
beer
has
great
drinkability
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
can
ommegang
do
no
wrong
mouthfeeldrinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
definitely
unique
in
my
beer
experience
not
something
i
would
drink
6
of
but
i
do
think
one
after
dinner
would
be
quite
nice
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
good
ommegang
this
poured
a
slightly
hazy
bronze
with
lots
of
tan
head
it
smelled
like
citrus
and
wild
floral
hops
with
wild
belgian
yeast
and
no
noticeable
malt
it
tasted
very
potent
more
sweet
than
bitter
like
earthy
wheat
mixed
with
wild
floral
hops
light
honey
malt
and
some
mulled
spices
it
was
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
smooth
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
clean
and
well
constructed
beer
that
wasnt
overpowering
in
its
belgian
flavoring
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
rare
vos
is
a
treat
to
the
palate
and
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
for
a
while
with
a
few
friends
there
are
numerous
flavors
and
qualities
that
leave
you
seeking
another
sip
to
find
more
to
enjoy
d
the
big
bottle
will
do
me
great
drinkability
would
buy
again
as
a
dinner
beer
another
wonderful
beer
form
ommegang
the
aroma
that
erupts
both
from
the
bottle
and
from
the
puffy
longlasting
head
is
full
of
bread
bananas
peaches
cloves
and
leaves
the
color
is
a
beautiful
ambermahogany
with
a
bit
white
head
that
settles
down
to
about
an
inch
and
stays
there
theres
plenty
of
fruit
in
the
taste
but
the
most
striking
thing
to
me
was
how
smooth
it
was
and
how
rich
it
tasted
down
to
the
last
drop
after
the
bottle
was
empty
i
found
myself
breathing
out
of
the
top
of
bottle
just
so
i
wouldnt
lose
the
smell
of
the
beer
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
at
any
time
of
year
d
really
nice
beer
for
a
belgian
amber
but
probably
my
least
favorite
from
ommegang
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers

indeed
havent
had
a
beer
from
this
brewery
yet
that
wasnt
delicious
d
a
few
nonconnoisseurs
that
ive
talked
to
not
that
i
am
one
yet
have
expressed
a
sincere
dislike
for
this
beer
and
i
couldnt
agree
less
as
far
as
american
belgians
go
i
put
it
at
the
top
of
the
list
or
very
close
to
it
and
i
really
feel
as
if
im
drinking
something
imported
it
has
that
taste
you
only
get
from
the
real
deal
and
the
boldness
and
audacity
that
you
rarely
find
outside
of
america
a
perfect
pairing
of
old
world
tradition
and
new
world
ingenuity
and
a
definite
members
only
spot
in
my
fridge
this
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
the
relatively
low
alcohol
6
5
for
a
belgian
means
you
can
get
in
one
or
two
more
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
another
winner
from
ommegang
from
a
750
ml
bottle
in
to
a
goblet
hazy
orange
with
off
white
head
smells
bready
with
some
fruit
in
the
background
snappy
sweet
taste
that
is
rather
tart
with
some
fruit
in
it
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
would
do
very
well
with
food
not
a
life
changer
but
a
very
nice
beer
exellent
american
breweries
can
be
proud
of
thier
belgian
style
ales
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
but
im
not
sure
if
i
will
purchase
again
dont
get
me
wrong
i
would
still
recommend
it
d
a
good
beer
nothing
off
and
the
nose
is
really
nice
but
overall
it
fails
to
deliver
drinkability
a
fine
easydrinking
brew
from
ommegang
certainly
worth
a
try
oh
and
the
orange
slice
it
was
delicious
frothy
white
head
with
nice

nice
amber
color
slightly

carbonation
good

and
spice
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
just
about
an
exceptional
ale
i
love
the
overall
balance
of
all
the
ingredients
yet
another
quality
brew
from
ommegang
d
i
really
recall
this
being
a
better
beer
than
it
is
but
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
there
is
anything
with
this
bottle
nothing
particularly
bad
about
it
but
it
is
just
kind
of
dull
and
unremarkable
especially
the
flavor
drinkability
light
crisp
and
balanced
this
one
always
leaves
you
wanting
another
i
bought
as
a
single
but
well
definitely
pick
up
a
4
pack
next
time
im
out
this
is
exactly
what
ive
wanted
as
something
light
im
stunned
how
good
this
is
for
the
prices
of
7
for
a
4
pack

from

convenience
concord
nh
overall
quite
a
decent
belgian
style
dubbel
from
ommegang
although
ive
had
better
from
them
definitely
worth
a
try
d
very
very
drinkable
not
quite
a
top
echelon
beer
but
very
close
definitely
one
i
come
back
to
time
and
again
and
one
i
would
recommend
anyone
try
shows
off
what
a
tremendous
brewery
ommegang
is
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
have
a
few
times
very
well
crafted
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
sly
fox
it
has
a
beautiful
red
orange
amber
color
with
a
hazy
body
tiny
bubbles
form
a
thick
foamy
head
that
has
a
light
tan
color
an
inviting
aroma
of
sweet
floral
orange
and
spices
mingle
with
doughy
yeast
and
malts
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
complex
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
character
with
caramel
malts
and
doughy
yeast
mixing
with
dark
cherries
spices
and
orange
peel
hops
add
some
light
bitterness
and
dryness
to
the
finish
the
palate
is
full
bodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
outstanding
overall
a
perfect
beer
for
a
variety
of
mealsoccasions
no
problems
enjoying
a
four
pack
of
this
treat
delicious
hazy

slight
bit
of
marmalade
pancake
syrup
and

the

followed
by
a
true
belgian
nose
that
has
some
bananas
earth
and
some
soft
floral

is
quite
creamy

with
enough
carbonation

not
make
it

all

controls
the
palate
with

good
and
quite
drinkable
poured
this
beer
into
my
chimay
goblet
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
big
white
head
that
faded
into
just
a
thin
white
layer
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
has
hints
of
vanilla
and
apricot
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
nothing
that
really
sticks
out
about
its
taste
profile
there
is
a
slight
tangy
sensation
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
i
had
expected
while
this
might
seem
like
a
ho
hum
beer
by
my
review
these
5
judging
categories
just
dont
do
it
justice
there
really
needs
to
be
a
sixth
category
for
balance
this
has
to
be
the
most
balanced
beer
ive
ever
drunk
there
really
isnt
any
flavor
that
i
can
really
distinguish
its
really
amazing
d
an
ok
drinkable
beer
feels
very
nice
on
the
palette
but
the
tequila
characteristic
of
the
beer
took
a
little
bit
away
from
it
for
me
i
think
that
someone
else
might
be
able
to
handle
a
sixer
of
these
as
it
is
a
fairly
rounded
brew
but
i
just
could
not
get
over
the
tequila
aftertaste
final
thoughts
nice
brew
very
mild
sweet
fruits
surface
in
the
aroma
mixed
amongst
the
belgium
yeast
a
rather
dry
belgium
style
brew
the
fruits
dont
make
much
a
statement
in
the
taste
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
help
add
some
pizzazz
but
all
things
considered
this
wont
be
one
i
go
for
again
d
this
is
immensely
drinkable
for
its
style
and
abv
drinkability
was
very
high
with
this
one
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
wonderful
complexity
of
flavors
without
being
bogged
down
by
alcohol
or
thickness
drinkability
a
solid
brew
especially
for
the
5
99
price
worth
a
revisit
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
this
one
but
its
not
a
bad
brew
the
apples
and
subtle
spices
hit
up
front
along
with
a
nice
amout
of
toasty
malt
bitterness
is
kept
to
a
low
as
expected
theres
a
slight
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
im
a
huge
fan
of
ommegang
but
this
beer
was
not
up
to
par
with
their
other
efforts
in
my
opinion
still
its
better
than
many
other
american
takes
on
belgian
ales
ive
had
this
beer
has
excellent
flavor
and
balance
and
does
not
come
off
too
sweet
or
dry
can
easily
have
a
few
of
these
md
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
a
medium
body
despite
the
lighter
flavors
carbonation
is
light
but
steady
adding
to
the
lighter
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
it
was
a
well
balanced
and
surprising
brew
lots
of
spices
rich
body
and
moderate
abv
make
this
a
great
session
brew
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
the
smell
came
out
of
the
bottle
as
soon
as
the
cork
came
out
smelled
a
little
funky
some
grassy
and
musty
scents
took
over
a
slight
malt
presence
tasted
light
and
fruity
with
a
slight
straw
taste
and
some
bitterness
this
one
also
got
better
as
it
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
dry
and
works
as
a
great
session
for
me
another
great
belgian
inspired
ale
from
ommegang
tasted
on
21908
drinkability
is
there
for
sure
i
could
easily
be
pursuaded
that
this
is
a
true
belgian
not
a
us
micro
great
job
this
brew
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
to
drink
a
ton
of
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
malty
as
i
was
expecting
still
it
was
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
belgian
take
on
the
amber
style
i
have
a
feeling
rare
vos
would
pair
even
better
with
food
than
by
itself
i
frequent
the
ommegang
beers
more
than
just
about
any
other
brand
they
are
cheap
easily
accessible
and
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
when
it
comes
to
an
american
brewery
taking
on
belgian
styles
allagash
coming
in
at
a
close
second
imo
nine
times
out
of
ten
i
go
with
hennepin
ommegang
or
three
philosophers
but
rarely
this
one
or
the
witbier
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
dont
remember
being
all
that
impressed
but
with
this
new
batch
i
decided
it
was
time
for
another
visit
poured
in
to
my
stella
artois
glass
a
very
nice
strawberry
blond
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
color
is
quite
striking
giving
off
a
sort
of
glow
aroma
reveals
a
melange
of
fruit
such
as
orange
lemon
nectarine
and
also
a
pinch
of
spice
lingering
in
the
background
flavor
begins
with
the
citrus
fruits
mentioned
above
with
a
nice
yeasty
finish
malt
is
also
worth
mentioning
as
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
lush
nicely
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
although
the
abv
isnt
all
that
high
i
could
feel
a
bit
of
warmth
after
a
few
sips
i
still
could
drink
two
bottles
of
this
without
too
much
of
a
problem
i
am
now
quite
happy
i
came
back
to
this
one
it
seems
like
the
most
underrated
of
the
beers
from
ommegang
pours
a
cloudy
amber
red
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lingers
for
a
long
time
it
has
a
very
light
bready
and
spice
aroma
the
beer
had
just
enough
spice
in
the
taste
to
make
it
interesting
with
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
body
and
a
light
hop
bite
at
the
end
at
6
5
abv
its
quite
drinkable
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
light
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
minimal
lacing
though
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
slight
yeast
tangy
citrusgrapefruitgrapes
with
some
slight
spice
and
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyyeasty
i
really
enjoy
the
tangyness
grapey
tones
this
brew
has
slight
spicecaramel
medium
body
a
wellrounded
complex
brew
very
drinkable
another
very
tasty
brew
from
ommegang
highly
recommended
overall
as
far
as
belgian
styles
there
are
infinite
others
that
are
miles
above
this
example
so
i
cannot
recommend
it
the
best
thing
about
this
ale
is
its
appearence
it
is
a
beautifull
cloudy
orangeamber
color
with
a
very
quickly
fading
head
the
overall
aroma
was
very
light
with
a
strong
dose
of
yeast
and
some
citrus
the
taste
was
nice
slightly
sweet
throughout
not
really
bitter
at
all
the
finish
was
quite
short
medium
to
light
body
with
somewhat
over
the
top
lively
carbonation
its
quite
drinkable
overall
a
wellrounded
enjoyable
brew
sorry
this
is
a
belgian
dark
and
the
finest
at
that
ok
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
really
nice
beverage
my
point
on
the
dark
characteristic
is
if
theyre
calling
in
news
crews
because
were
drinking
a
dark
then
im
missing
the
boat
duval
is
calling
this
an
amber
ok
its
amber
how
difficult
is
it
to
rate
a
beer
when
the
swath
of
acceptable
interpretation
is
so
wide
that
you
can
drive
a
truck
through
it
whats
the
point
again
dr
lew
bryson
has
a
fitting
argument
about
style
anyway
it
smells
wonderful
imo
when
a
beverage
reveals
that
classic
earthy
belgian
yeast
aroma
then
youre
in
for
a
treat
whats
interesting
to
me
about
this
one
is
that
how
malt
presents
itself
in
a
toasted
character
there
is
an
aggressiveness
that
i
would
normally
associate
with
alcohol
but
at
6
5
abv
this
one
may
be
deceiving
me
the
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
light
the
flavor
is
earthy
creamy
and
has
a
maltiness
that
i
personally
associate
with
a
lager
the
mouthtaste
combination
is
quite
drinkable
sorry
if
this
isnt
helpful
intended
more
as
notes
to
self
enjoy
a
good
tasting
ale
you
definetly
taste
the
hops
and
fruit
with
a
mild
spice
tastes
of
spices
yeasty
dry
floral
hops
and
fruity
good
dry
finish
very
drinkable
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
not
too
heavy
or
light
very
tangy
and
has
a
lot
of
personality
i
think
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
and
try
again
this
one
hit
me
on
the
subtle
side
and
that
surprised
me
quite
dry
and
wellcarbonated
easy
to
drink
as
with
all
ommegang
beers
this
is
a
beer
ill
be
buying
more
of
recently
tried
ommegangs
abbey
ale
and
really
liked
it
this
one
is
probably
just
as
good
if
not
better
considered
a
belgian
dark
ale
this
porus
a
lightcopper
hazy
color
with
a
decent
head
copped
singly
from
total
wine
and
more
in
union
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
typical
belgian
ale
flavors
with
yeasty
alcohol
and
sweet
fruity
flavors
present
taste
complements
the
aroma
with
a
sharp
sweet
fruity
flavor
that
goes
down
crisp
clean
and
smooth
great
aftertaste
and
good
mouthfeel
with
an
incredibly
easy
drinkability
nice
blend
of
fruit
and
sugar
present
in
the
taste
and
although
that
typical
belgian
ale
flavor
is
present
the
fruitysweet
characteristic
of
the
brew
is
not
at
all
overwhelming
excellent
beer
definitely
recommended
one
of
the
most
drinkable
belgian
style
beers
ive
had
i
could
make
an
evening
out
of
this
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
at
6
5
is
almost
sessionable
and
with
the
way
it
tastes
its
a
good
thing
the
alcohol
is
so
low
this
is
a
beer
that
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
its
an
absolutely
outofthisworldsmooth
amber
more
american
brewers
need
to
make
ambers
like
this
its
the
polar
opposite
of
the
hopback
ambernugget
nectarschool
of
amber
brewing
and
is
put
together
nicely
enough
that
its
merits
can
be
thrown
up
against
brewery
ommegangs
other
offerings
not
an
easy
accomplishment
when
you
are
going
against
three
philosophers
and
ommegang
abbey
ale
but
this
beer
for
a
lot
of
people
will
eclipse
the
aforementioned
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
if
it
were
more
widely
distributed
could
be
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
occupying
the
growing
category
of
gateway
beers
that
bring
the
drinker
from
generic
american
macro
lagers
to
craft
brewed
beers
a
truly
inspired
effort
by
ommegang
and
one
that
is
sure
to
be
a
staple
of
my
beer
fridge
for
years
to
come
poured
from
the
champagnestyle
bottle
this
was
a
good
looking
beercloudy
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
lacing
bouqet
was
very
fruity
with
apricots
and
raspberries
coming
to
mind
along
with
notes
of
honey
flowers
fresh
bread
dough
and
a
musty
barnyard
aroma
taste
was
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
with
a
moderate
bitterness
astringent
sourish
finish
medium
in
body
with
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orangey
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
one
and
a
half
white
head
that
bubbles
down
to
a
cap
in
a
few
minutes
there
is
a
solid
cookie
yeasty
funk
but
really
nothing
else
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
with
spicy
yeast
and
a
bit
of
fresh
red
apple
with
a
suprisingly
alcoholic
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
rather
loose
and
watery
and
rather
insubstantial
the
drinkablity
is
smooth
and
easy
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
style
of
beer
at
all
brew
poured
to
a
nice
orange
color
with
amber
highlights
filled
the
goblet
perfectly
with
a
nice
sized
head
that
went
right
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
surprising
this
did
not
translate
into
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
the
aromas
that
come
to
mind
first
are
fruit
to
me
it
has
a
strong
apple
presence
also
there
is
a
classic
clove
yeast
scent
that
is
just
so
good
also
a
nice
subdued
spiciness
the
flavor
is
very
good
spicy
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
reminds
me
of
a
peppery
mix
sweet
flavors
from
the
malts
almost
a
candy
like
flavor
adequate
hop
and
a
nice
semidry
finish
now
i
will
admit
that
i
am
not
the
best
at
putting
my
thoughts
down
on
paper
so
i
know
that
i
am
missing
a
few
things
here
but
imo
this
is
a
excellent
brew
one
that
i
have
had
numerous
times
in
the
past
being
in
ny
but
not
in
a
number
of
years
glad
to
give
this
one
a
try
once
again
a
very
solid
offering
from
ommegang
what
flavor
there
is
is
ok
it
just
doesnt
blow
your
socks
off
malts
berries
and
then
a
touch
of
acidity
and
baking
soda
in
the
aftertaste
pours
a
goldenlight
amber
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
hangs
there
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
spice
taste
is
malty
and
rich
upfront
with
a
fruityspicy
element
showing
through
tastes
a
bit
funky
in
a
good
way
coriandernutmeg
stand
out
to
me
even
if
they
may
not
be
in
this
beer
and
its
just
a
very
solid
ale
hazy
and
orange
with
a
decent
head
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
of
floral
hops
maybe
cloves
and
apples
taste
is
dry
and
malty
with
a
clean
coarse
carbonated
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
flavor
stands
up
to
the
spiciest
foods
a
little
expensive
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
but
certainly
a
pleasure
i
would
indulge
in
again
d
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
an
excellent
beer
drinkability
not
bad
worth
a
try
anything
is
good
from
ommegang
i
drank
this
almost
a
year
later
drinkability
a
good
brew
easy
to
consume
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
dry
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
i
plan
on
getting
my
hands
on
a
case
of
this
for
the
summer
extremely
refreshing
and
nice
entry
point
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
for
nonbeergeek
friends
not
quite
what
the
chimay
blue
is
as
far
as
the
belgian
style
goes
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
cloudy
dark
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
sticky
looking
though
sour
wheat
and
yeast
characters
with
some
soft
lemon
lime
rocky
candy
and
floral
hop
notes
for
a
nose
yeasty
twang
is
very
smoothed
out
nutty
and
caramel
malts
toasted
wheat
cracker
cereal
grains
herbal
and
floral
hop
characters
are
slightly
perfumy
citrus
is
lemony
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
pith
some
caramel
into
the
finish
with
coriander
like
spiciness
and
unripe
green
banana
medium
to
full
body
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
slightly
cloying
and
a
crisp
carbonation
that
eeks
out
some
creaminess
hoppier
than
expected
good
stuff
the
beer
fell
cleanly
into
my
glass
with
a
good
thick
head
of
white
suds
that
remained
until
i
was
finished
active
bubbles
are
visible
through
the
clear
cedar
colored
body
smells
of
sweets
and
spices
give
way
to
a
more
subtle
flavor
of
toasted
grains
and
bready
yeast
a
lingering
raisin
flavor
stays
int
eh
mouth
after
the
swallow
the
scratchy
almost
velcro
mouthfeel
perfectly
accompanies
this
brew
definitely
worth
the
buy
mouthfeel
as
noted
above
is
smooth
but
not
what
i
would
describe
as
creamy
the
tight
bubbles
of
carbonation
seem
to
bring
the
spices
to
the
forefront
which
came
off
a
little
overbearing
in
my
opinion
looks
great
and
smells
great
but
doesnt
come
off
as
such
overall
nonetheless
worth
a
go
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
much
better
than
expected
as
this
is
characterized
here
as
a
belgian
dark
which
tend
to
get
too
thick
and
sweet
for
me
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
an
absolute
delight
drinkability
high
quality
extremely
enjoyable
belgian
amber
ale
perfect
for
quaffing

so
easy
to
drink
and
excellent
paired
with
food
very
versatile
good
with
a
hot
ham
sandwich
or
thanksgiving
dinner
definitely
a
beer
to
always
have
on
hand
drinkable
and
flavorful
d
pretty
good
had
this
beer
in
cooperstown
ny
it
was
pretty
darn
good
especially
ontap
the
beer
came
to
me
with
a
nice
thich
head
the
coloring
was
a
nice
lightbrownreddish
color
the
smell
was
nice
but
i
do
not
remember
much
regarding
that
the
taste
was
a
nice
nutty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
good
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
a
wellbalanced
beer
worth
trying
again
another
from
the
ommegang
gang
pours
a
hazy
light
copperbrown
w
a
huge
head
that
took
its
time
going
down
good
lacing
as
well
a
bready
fruit
aroma
w
an
orangelike
citrusy
undertone
a
faint
alcohol
prescence
as
well
a
tart
slighlty
vinous
flavor
w
an
interesting
hop
flavor
as
well
some
fruity
flavor
comes
through
in
the
end
a
dry
lightmed
bodied
brew
very
bubbly
cant
help
but
burp
after
each
sip
a
nice
beer
not
to
high
of
an
abv
makes
this
one
quite
quaffable
like
so
many
ommegang
products
rare
vos
is
a
treat
great
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
evening
great
to
share
especially
since
it
comes
in
750ml
bottles
and
it
goes
great
with
cheeses
smooth
and
tasty
it
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
try
it
and
enjoy
this
has
a
nice
cloudy
pour
with
a
taste
to
fit
this
is
a
smooth
amber
beer
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
mild
sweet
to
it
smells
like
a
yeasty
beer
and
it
is
good
head
and
bubbles
coupled
with
a
lack
of
overt
bitterness
make
this
a
quite
drinkable
beverage
d
i
like
it
always
have
but
one
of
these
big
bottles
will
suffice
at
a
sitting
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
presented
with
a
smell
of
malt
and
yeast
nice
caramelamber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
lacing
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
throughout
the
tasting
well
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
pleasant
mouthfeel
with
a
tingle
across
the
tongue
mild
hoppy
taste
reminiscent
of
a
pale
ale
with
a
subtle
taste
of
coriander
to
boot
clean
finish
with
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
at
the
end
another
enjoyable
brew
from
ommegang
although
not
what
i
would
consider
characteristic
of
a
belgian
drinkability

i
would
have
another
but
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
color
the
heas
id
large
fluffy
and
white
it
recedes
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
cloves
pears
and
squash
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
a
nice
mustiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
dink
again
d
this
is
ommegangs
weak
sister
d
rare
vos
is
a
nice
belgian
ale
i
will
probably
have
this
one
again
i
have
enjoyed
other
offerings
from
ommegang
a
lot
more
than
this
one
so
far
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
candied
sugar
and
a
belgian
yeast
in
the
taste
belgiany
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
corriander
a
small
bitter
mouthfeeland
a
dry
belgian
yeast
aftertaste
smooth
and
mellow
with
a
nice
hop
presence
really
a
very
very
good
beer
overall
pours
out
a
cloudy
orange
amber
with
huge
head
and
massive
carbonation
smells
very
esterymy
sense
of
smell
sucks
but
the
esters
show
through
taste
is
a
very
neutral
beer
slight
estersbut
very
light
in
malt
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
normaldrinkablility
is
actually
very
wellgo
down
really
smooth
this
brew
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
solid
beer
recommended
d
this
beer
is
light
in
sweetness
but
has
a
nice
subtle
complex
flavor
the
soft
bitterness
and
the
nice
sweet
flavor
have
some
good
depth
d
a
pleasant
malty
belgian
worth
a
try
for
sure
a
very
tasty
ale
one
i
would
probably
pair
w
poultry
a
luscious
amber
somehat
cloudy
brew
a
modest
but
healthy
fuzzy
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
with
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
mildly
malt
and
wheat
a
bit
like
a
hefe
but
a
mellower
quality
then
the
first
taste
says
more
hefe
to
me
i
didnt
expect
that
i
dont
get
the
hops
so
much
more
like
a
mild
brown
bread
but
decidedly
like
a
hefe
with
delicate
wheat
and
lots
of
citrus
going
on
strong
tingling
carbonation
at
the
front
but
it
maintains
a
subtle
blended
flavor
and
feel
medium
drinkability
but
more
to
be
savored
for
those
who
admire
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
though
comment
this
is
my
first
belgium
style
amber
and
maybe
it
just
took
me
by
surprise
but
i
wasnt
impressed
maybe
its
just
a
style
that
i
need
to
get
more
accustomed
too
awesome
brew
very
cheap
to
get
and
very
amazing
drinkablity
is
wonderful
yeaaah
boooy
sorry
thats
the
gangster
in
me
coming
out
once
again
refer
to
the
avatar
its
proof
im
gangster
insert
laughing
from
the
masses
about
10
per
fourpack
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
brew
as
compared
with
some
of
ommegangs
other
offerings
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
would
rate
3
philosophers
and
hennepin
well
above
this
brew
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
the
bubbles
were
tight
and
the
lacing
was
pretty
the
aroma
is
initially
sour
with
malt
showing
through
after
a
few
minutes
rest
the
taste
is
spicy
and
sour
with
some
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
but
shows
a
carbonation
bite
overall
this
is
a
delight
i
am
currently
brewing
an
amber
ale
and
can
only
hope
that
my
beer
turns
out
close
to
this
i
really
love
the
color
of
the
beer
its
a
light
amber
with
just
a
bit
of
cloudiness
the
foam
on
any
of
these
beers
in
the
750ml
bottle
can
get
a
bit
much
if
you
dont
pour
it
slow
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
buying
again
this
is
moderately
drinkable
its
light
but
lots
of
carbonation
and
while
the
taste
is
inoffensive
and
pretty
good
its
not
so
great
you
cant
get
enough
12oz
bottle
pours
a
nice
cloudy
dark
copper
with
decent
head
but
only
some
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
kind
of
like
a
hefeweizen
first
taste
is
tangy
and
spicy
further
tastes
continue
with
the
spice
dominating
its
a
nice
flavour
though
perhaps
not
overly
complex
great
clingy
off
white
head
slightly
hazy
aromas
are
big
on
the
esters
with
dark
fruit
and
spiceherbals
like
aniseed
and
clove
dryish
on
the
palate
thought
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
reasonably
crisp
but
doesnt
hold
up
as
well
at
warmer
temperatures
as
a
large
phenolic
flavor
goes
from
support
to
dominance
especially
in
the
finish
da
decent
offering
from
ommegang
not
my
favourite
not
sure
why
this
is
classified
as
a
dark
ale
because
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
has
the
trademark
belgian
yeast
taste
and
is
a
very
good
beer
if
you
are
new
to
belgians
this
is
a
good
starting
point
very
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
d
pretty
good
fairly
low
abv
for
a
belgian
and
a
pleasant
flavor
a
bit
phenolic
but
splitting
the
bottle
would
be
nice
ommegangs
rare
vos
reminds
me
of
saisonstyle
ales
in
its
texture
and
offdry
finish
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
an
impressive
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
some
spices
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
features
a
subtle
tartness
with
dark
fruits
spices
galore
and
a
nice
dry
finish
with
some
hops
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
attempts
at
a
belgian
ale
that
i
have
every
tried
highly
recommended
by
the
way
this
brew
is
bargain
priced
at
under
5
served
from
a
750ml
into
a
large
tulip
glass
pours
a
light
amber
with
great
clarity
and
a
pillow
of
head
aromas
are
sweet
floral
yeasty
notes
of
spice
at
first
mellowing
to
carmel
and
honey
on
the
finish
backround
flavors
are
somewhat
lost
or
at
least
difficult
to
distinguish
through
the
carbonation
very
crisp
almost
sharp
may
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
a
lot
of
people
liking
this
brew
might
even
be
able
to
get
some
people
to
start
trying
something
besides
bmc
with
this
beer
give
a
bottle
of
rare
vos
to
some
unenlightened
friends
you
never
know
deep
amber
color
good
foam
head
with
staying
power
good
aroma
some
fruity
hints
some
malt
nothing
overpowering
but
a
good
bouquet
superior
taste
excellent
body
not
too
heavyanother
drawback
of
a
belgian
hence
my
4
5
drinkability
it
is
on
the
pricey
side
but
still
less
expensive
than
a
true
belgian
had
a
bottle
with
seafood
enchiladas
at
the
mission
restaurant
in
syracuse
a
great
pairing
rare
vos
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
amber
duvel
though
not
quite
as
the
complex
the
malts
are
sweet
and
mild
with
an
apple
cherry
and
berry
taste
very
drinkable
and
tasty
but
it
might
be
overpriced
if
youre
a
budget
beer
shopper
or
think
rogue
is
too
expensive
pours
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
dense
smooth
head
smells
of
oranges
prunes
and
candi
sugar
the
taste
is
fruity
up
front
but
quickly
overtaken
by
an
assertive
malt
the
finish
is
oaky
with
a
lot
of
tannins
and
an
odd
bitterness
not
bad
but
not
what
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
nicely
carbonated
though
the
drinkability
isnt
bad
as
your
tastebuds
warm
to
it
the
finish
is
pleasant
and
just
dry
enough
to
urge
another
sip
i
like
it
but
not
as
much
as
i
remember
from
a
couple
of
years
ago
not
sure
if
its
changed
i
have
or
we
both
have
ill
have
to
give
this
another
go
to
figure
it
out
i
think
pours
an
orangey
amber
with
a
head
that
maintains
shape
but
is
a
bit
small
leaves
some
wisps
of
lace
smells
of
toasty
malts
with
some
fruity
yeast
and
apples
flavor
is
a
great
mix
of
apples
pears
caramel
passion
fruit
toasted
malts
a
subdued
yeast
spiciness
tealike
hops
and
a
bit
of
worty
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
some
carbonated
zing
delicious
belgian
style
amber
highly
drinkable
overall
this
may
not
be
an
example
of
what
usually
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
of
a
belgian
style
ale
but
that
is
probably
because
i
have
come
to
expect
hugely
alcoholic
brews
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
which
i
think
will
go
well
with
grilled
meats
or
i
would
imagine
anything
with
a
cream
sauce
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
copperybrown
color
murky
with
a
slight
white
head
malty
peppery
aroma
flavor
is
rather
dry
sweet
and
spicy
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
belgians
ive
had
but
still
rather
tasty
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
bit
of
a
film
sensation
in
the
mouth
otherwise
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
a
great
bargain
compared
to
some
of
the
belgian
imports
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
foamy
head
that
stays
the
entire
drink
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
ripe
fruits
grapes
and
sweet
malt
taste
starts
out
a
bit
fruity
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
goes
down
with
a
bready
finish
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
in
the
afternoon
very
good
and
would
drink
again
d
overall
nothing
to
keep
you
really
coming
back
its
possible
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
but
youd
likely
still
be
searching
for
flavor
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
taste
easy
to
drink
etc
i
think
this
would
appeal
to
a
variety
of
people
and
it
probably
would
go
well
with
a
number
of
different
foods
as
well
overall
i
previously
thought
that
the
ommegang
brewery
could
do
no
wrong
and
i
still
belive
this
but
the
category
ba
gives
this
beer
is
misleading
i
suppose
its
given
this
category
because
there
is
no
belgian
amber
ale
listed
as
a
style
i
would
drink
this
again
but
only
if
sharing
with
friends
so
i
could
see
how
they
feel
as
well
its
a
good
belgian
style
but
not
my
favourite
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
the
label
says
that
this
can
be
aged
but
im
not
so
sure
about
that
drinkability
not
ranked
as
high
as
others
id
much
rather
be
drinking
three
philosophers
or
hennepin
d
does
not
entertain
the
buds
rather
average
i
looked
at
some
notes
id
taken
on
this
beer
about
a
year
ago
and
i
said
pretty
much
the
same
things
to
me
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
need
to
get
back
in
the
habit
of
buying
this
often
a
great
beer
for
a
great
price
i
could
polish
off
this
750
bottle
with
little
difficulty
a
very
nice
brew
overall
the
best
belgian
style
amber
i
have
had
to
date
this
aint
bad
i
dont
think
its
the
freshest
it
could
be
but
thats
my
fault
it
is
very
subtle
though
and
would
be
good
for
getting
a
person
into
belgian
beers
its
not
overpowering
in
any
sortthis
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
nice
beer
overall
very
good
a
bit
bitter
for
a
traditional
belgian
but
that
fits
my
taste
profile
very
well
very
nice
pour
thick
head
with
reat
belgian
lace
spiciness
is
very
evident
cloves
buttery
cinnamon
bread
huge
yeast
presence
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
with
great
flavor
fruity
spicy
yeasts
all
belgian
all
the
time
alcohol
creeps
up
like
a
boozy
wine
as
the
phenolic
notes
carry
on
to
the
aftertaste
its
great
to
know
that
american
brewers
can
duplicate
the
style
so
true
to
form
carbonation
lifts
the
mouthfeel
to
lighter
levels
making
it
very
smooth
going
down
thick
and
bubbly
but
has
a
relatively
clean
finish
considering
its
thickness
coats
the
tongue
its
a
delicious
formidable
beer
tastes
great
but
is
maybe
too
heavy
for
allnight
drinking

i
finally
broke
down
and
busted
out
the
wallet
to
buy
this
beer
then
i
almost
dented
my
ceiling
when
i
failed
to
properly
finesse
the
cork
out
of
the
bottle
oops
the
pour
was
beautiful
big
poofy

only
a

aroma
penetrated
my
olefactory
senses
but
the
flavor
is
dynamite
warming

orange

light

this
is
a
quality

ale
that
delivers
all
the
prototypical
characters
without
being

drinkability
very
smooth
and
a
fairly
competitive
price
i
think
i
would
buy
the
other
flavors
over
this
one
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
nicely
follow
the
directions
on
the
bottle
and
pour
out
very
slowly
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
thick
everlasting
white
head
that
forms
on
the
top
of
the
brew
once
youve
sampled
the
rich
crisp
hoppy
smell
however
you
may
kick
yourself
if
you
pour
too
quick
the
head
wont
go
anywhere
on
this
slightly
ruddy
amber
brew
so
pour
with
care
and
you
can
enjoy
it
right
away
start
is
malty
smooth
with
a
slightly
sweet
note
settles
fullbodied
with
a
variety
of
flavors
caramel
wheat
and
a
nearhidden
fruitiness
are
the
most
distinct
flavors
i
can
detect
finishes
with
a
hop
bitter
edge
and
a
longlasting
but
not
altogether
unpleasant
aftertaste
in
fact
i
dare
say
for
those
who
like
amber
beers
this
is
an
ideal
bottle
especially
when
its
as
fresh
as
the
ones
i
picked
up
today
it
has
superlative
character
flavor
and
blend
rare
vos
is
without
a
doubt
the
sly
fox
of
fullbodied
ales
in
fact
i
think
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
beer
well
thats
a
tough
call
but
i
am
certain
it
is
my
favorite
when
it
comes
to
nonvintage
micro
or
macrobrews
i
only
wish
i
could
get
a
fourpack
of
this
stuff
in
texas
instead
of
making
the
trek
into
the
far
north
give
it
a
try
and
i
know
you
wont
be
disappointed
danny
brought
this
to
me
witha
thick
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
the
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
mediumamber
the
nose
had
a
distinctive
yeastdriven
mustiness
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
full
and
very
effervescent
the
taste
was
fruity
like
juicyfruit
gum
musty
and
with
a
tang
of
spiciness
the
finish
was
very
dry
with
the
mustiness
leaving
a
dusty
feeling
on
the
back
of
my
throat
yow
if
not
a
bit
mild
mannered
a
respectable
belgian
amber
i
think
i
will
stick
with
the
ommegang
abbey
ale
if
given
the
choice
got
this
in
a
25
4
oz
cork
bottle
for
around
4
bucks
the
smell
is
the
best
part
very
fruit
with
a
slight
hop
scent
and
a
strong
yeast
scent
taste
fruity
as
well
almost
like
a
hard
cider
not
something
im
a
big
fan
of
but
something
thats
interesting
and
an
occasional
pick
up
at
the
beer
store
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
settled
fairly
quick
for
a
belgian
not
much
in
the
lacing
department
the
smell
is
of
light
malt
light
belgian
yeast
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
you
can
taste
the
malt
and
belgian
yeastspice
up
front
little
sweet
and
it
ends
with
a
touch
of
hops
this
beer
is
well
carbonated
but
not
too
much
where
it
limits
its
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
if
i
am
ever
up
visiting
the
baseball
hall
of
fame
i
am
definitely
checking
out
this
brewery
drinkability
odd
drinkability
is
good
but
the
beer
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
ommegang
brews
a
damn
good
ameribelgian
overall
ommegang
continues
to
prove
a
reliable
domestic
belgian
brewery
not
what
id
call
a
strong
dark
but
a
sold
belgian
ale
nonetheless
i
strongly
recommend
any
of
their
offerings
one
final
point
i
picked
this
one
up
for
5
99
which
is
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
bang
for
the
buck
nice
looking
bottle
packaged
like
a
champagne
bottle
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
hazy
yellowamber
color
with
a
frothy
foamy
head
smell
is
mostly
of
amber
malt
a
slight
hop
profile
and
very
slight
tinge
of
alcohol
perhaps
some
small
amount
of
spice
taste
is
initially
sweet
of
the
amber
malt
a
slight
metallic
taste
followed
by
a
hoppy
sort
of
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
carbonation
but
the
beer
is
rather
light
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
worth
trying
overall
a
bit
too
big
and
strong
of
a
belgian
pale
for
regular
drinking
but
a
nice
beer
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
the
beer
has
a
gorgeous
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
this
has
a
great
taste
of
fruits
and
is
especially
vibrant
with
a
hint
of
orange
this
went
down
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
eaten
something
with
this
as
it
would
go
well
with
some
of
my
meat
dishes
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
very
nice
offering
that
i
will
certainly
will
have
again
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
it
is
certainly
worth
it
i
may
have
to
cellar
a
few
bottles
for
a
while
and
taste
the
difference
overall
a
great
brew
with
a
lot
of
taste
and
provides
to
be
quite
an
enjoyable
belgium
style
beer
a
great
interpretation
and
a
great
bang
for
the
buck
as
well
would
drink
it
again
meal
or
no
meal
again
in
an
instant
highly
recommended
frothy
long
lasting
head
tops
a
deep
amber
slightly
yeasty
appearance
the
aromas
was
full
of
soft
esters
cloves
citrus
and
sweet
malts
was
quite
inviting
this
ale
is
a
smooth
complex
well
balanced
assortment
of
cloves
ginger
and
lemons
which
compliment
a
soft
maltiness
a
nice
peppery
earthiness
was
detected
through
out
for
such
a
complex
brew
the
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
and
spritzy
with
just
some
phenols
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
finest
ales
ive
drank
tonight
is
st
nicholas
eve
a
very
nice
ale
to
compliment
my
wifes
spicey
german
christmas
cookies
a
real
steal
for
3
99
for
a
25
oz
bottle
well
worth
a
try
though
a
very
good
ale
another
excellent
job
from
ommegang
this
is
a
very
nice
sipping
brew
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
belgian
serves
well
as
an
apperitif
or
as
a
complement
to
a
creamy
belgian
or
french
cheese
plate
drinkabilitynotes
a
quite
drinkable
example
of
the
style
seems
quite
authentic
when
compared
to
belgianbrewed
examples
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
bitter
and
heavy
for
myself
though
the
ale
is
still
very
drinkable
wavz
750ml
poured
with
a
cream
white
head
with
large
bubbles
nonclear
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
suspended
yeast
yeast
totally
nonflocculating
so
even
a
careful
pour
would
have
left
12
the
bottle
behind
if
i
didnt
take
some
yeast
aroma
was
typical
ommegang
sour
and
spicy
with
vapors
of
peach
and
cherry
palate
was
less
sour
than
aroma
and
about
12
way
between
duvel
and
ommegang
ommegang
the
fine
dose
of
yeast
did
cause
massive
rumbling
in
my
plumbing
later
that
night
though
this
is
a
full
flavored
beer
which
i
enjoyed
very
much
i
would
recommend
it
to
all
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
belgian
ale
nice
and
fresh
not
to
heavy
or
strong
exellent
taste
tried
this
with
mussels
recently
nice
great
beer
by
ommegang
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
no
date
although
im
sure
it
can
be
cellared
for
years
to
come
pours
a
beautiful
clear
copper
with
a
rocky
white
head
excellent
retention
smells
of
spices
hints
of
the
yeast
and
toasted
malt
very
nice
kinda
earthy
taste
reflects
much
of
the
same
a
real
yeasty
malty
character
to
it
with
hints
of
citrus
travels
well
touch
of
bitter
hops
at
the
end
flavors
of
the
alcohol
too
but
not
overwhelming
nice
mouthfeel
although
it
could
be
a
little
thicker
i
think
overall
very
good
glad
i
got
a
four
pack
of
this
recommended
anytime
d
just
strong
enough
to
enjoy
and
relax
on
a
late
night
great
for
enjoying
with
a
friend
or
girlfriendwife
after
a
long
day
at
work
d
very
good
not
nearly
as
spicy
as
some
belgianstyle
ales
but
still
quite
good
i
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
no
head
immediately
i
could
smell
corriander
and
bananna
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
no
carbonation
whatsoever
the
taste
was
sour
i
think
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
batch
of
this
stuff
as
my
experience
of
it
is
not
consistent
with
other
reviews
either
that
or
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
style
a
great
beer
with
food
or
have
just
one
great
effort
how
do
they
sour
this
thing
funny
the
other
reviews
dont
mention
sour
bottle
conditioned
did
something
get
growing
in
here
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
complex
brew
would
make
for
a
great
all
night
savouring
session
brew
and
while
deep
and
complex
is
also
an
approachable
beer
and
as
such
would
make
good
crossover
fare
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
again
poured
a
burnt
orange
color
with
amber
highlights
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
appeared
initially
but
disappeared
quickly
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
belgian
yeast
spice
and
estery
smells
leading
the
way
taste
is
similar
with
the
addition
of
some
fruitier
flavors
such
as
banana
and
citric
acid
a
peppery
flavor
lingers
towards
the
end
of
a
taste
much
like
la
maudite
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
slick
as
the
sweetness
of
the
yeast
malts
and
fruits
are
offset
rather
aggressively
for
the
style
by
hops
there
is
a
lot
of
nice
flavor
here
and
this
is
the
first
corked
belgian
style
ale
i
have
had
that
isnt
intimidatingly
high
in
alcohol
this
bomber
will
do
me
just
fine
this
is
an
interesting
exciting
and
very
drinkable
take
in
my
parts
this
is
going
for
almost
9bottle
rather
than
the
6ish
it
should
be
going
for
so
it
is
difficult
to
choose
this
over
comparably
priced
chimay
still
though
another
stellar
effort
from
ommegang
a
feel
good
factor
beer
for
sure
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
goto
session
beers
its
huge
on
flavor
and
at
6
5
abv
its
something
i
can
drink
a
few
of
terrific
beer
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
after
decanting
according
to
directions
and
has
a
light
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
head
the
aroma
is
kind
of
sparse
it
has
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
fruity
ester
kind
of
like
passionflower
but
overall
its
kind
of
light
the
flavor
is
good
not
really
strong
or
dominating
but
pretty
appropriate
for
style
overall
this
is
a
good
drinkin
beer
not
your
usual
belgian
rocket
fuel
but
good
i
confess
id
like
a
little
more
distinctive
aromas
though
poured
a
clear
amberorange
color
with
massive
puffy
white
head
smell
is
a
tantalizing
mixture
of
sweet
fruit
with
some
background
spiciness
taste
foloows
through
on
the
smell
with
the
spiciness
becoming
more
prominent
but
not
overshadowing
the
sweet
fruitiness
some
yeastiness
also
to
be
found
nice
full
creamy
finish
with
the
sweet
spices
really
showing
through
great
drinkability
i
paired
this
with
grilled
shrimp
and
scallops
for
an
excellent
meal
d
imo
not
a
session
beer
well
brewed
beer
though
only
complaint
is
that
at
times
carbonation
kinda
blanded
out
flavor
i
will
be
back
to
this
though
d
an
easy
drinking
hugebodied
belgian
style
without
a
ridicoulous
alcohol
content
bring
this
one
on
this
a
beer
that
may
be
better
without
food
than
with
enjoy
a
glass
before
or
after
dinner
very
drinkable
drinkability
another
winner
from
ommegang
of
all
their
beers
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
but
thats
like
saying
that
shelbys
first
mustang
was
the
least
impressive
of
his
modified
race
cars
the
light
sweet
flavors
and
the
refreshing
finish
carry
this
beer
well
masking
the
booze
and
upping
the
general
drinkability
fantastic
d
the
yeastie
byproducts
spicy
phenolics
are
a
little
much
for
me
i
couldnt
quite
finish
the
750
ml
in
one
sitting
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
visually
and
in
flavor
buy
it
overall
a
superior
belgian
pale
ale
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
ommegang
nails
this
one
dead
on
cheers
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
with
a
hazy
amberorange
body
and
a
massive
rocky
and
creamy
ecru
foam
cap
with
super
sticky
lacing
yeasty
sourdough
bread
aromas
with
anise
and
bergamot
and
a
warm
and
sweet
barnyard
funk
scent
not
like
a
lambic
just
earthy
i
guess
bready
anise
inflected
sweetness
is
finished
off
by
a
round
of
tannic
and
earthy
bitter
hops
full
creamy
mouthfeel
but
medium
bodied
some
yeasty
sourness
is
apparent
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
ommegangs
second
most
drinkableapproachable
beer
great
stuff
as
always
this
beer
poured
from
the
tap
had
a
great
appearance
it
gave
a
nice
ambercopper
color
with
a
beautiful
head
that
stuck
to
the
end
with
excellent
lacing
it
gave
a
nice
spicy
and
orange
smell
same
flavors
found
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
full
and
frothy
excellent
beer
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
6
50
abv
since
i
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
during
each
sip
and
after
each
swallow
the
spices
never
overpower
here
and
this
is
exceptionally
balanced
both
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
very
subdued
and
a
bit
lacking
here
but
all
other
aspects
of
this
beer
are
enjoyable
ommegang
does
a
great
job
of
bringing
belgian
styles
and
tastes
to
the
states
and
this
offering
is
great
proof
of
that
had
to
check
myself
after
two
very
enjoyable
brew
d
goes
down
smooth
and
satisfying
someone
should
refill
my
chalice
drinkability
this
is
good
but
drying
effect
hinders
sessionability
at
least
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
ommegang
brews
are
high
quality
low
cost
beers
so
pick
some
up
very
nice
beer
overall
an
intriguing
mix
of
flavors
and
a
great
idea
by
ommegang
to
brew
a
belgian
amber
ale
a
good
starting
point
for
those
who
want
to
get
into
belgianstyle
beers
recommended
big
corkncage
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
very
loud
pop
when
opening
and
the
pour
reveals
a
hazed
copper
body
with
a
frothy
two
finger
tan
head
that
becomes
creamier
as
the
many
beads
of
carbonation
replace
the
larger
bubbles
with
very
small
ones
and
leave
a
nice
trail
of
lacing
as
i
drink
the
aroma
is
very
phenolic
right
off
the
bat
with
spicy
yeast
and
a
lemony
zest
combined
with
nutty
malts
greenleafyspicy
hops
and
notes
of
pear
apple
and
melon
the
taste
is
the
same
but
adds
cloves
medicine
banana
and
a
phenolic
bitterness
that
eventually
gives
way
to
a
hoppy
bitterness
all
on
top
of
a
body
that
starts
prickly
but
evens
out
to
reveal
a
medium
body
that
is
quite
smooth
a
great
deal
at
5
a
bottle
drinkability
great
beer
could
easily
have
a
lot
in
an
evening
and
enjoy
it
overall
not
bad
but
not
terribly
memorable
with
some
of
the
more
challenging
and
wonderful
offerings
from
ommegang
ill
probably
pass
this
one
by
in
the
future
the
weakest
offfering
from
this
brewery
in
my
opinion
the
body
is
decent
very
refreshing
i
would
drink
alot
of
this
if
it
were
available
in
iowa
cant
beat
the
price
for
a
great
750ml
im
looking
forward
to
the
witte
this
belgian
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
good
white
foamy
head
the
smell
was
not
pleasant
a
first
i
thought
of
regurgitate
then
skunked
came
to
mind
if
subsequent
samplings
prove
this
smell
an
anomaly
i
will
come
back
and
rereview
the
taste
is
nice
with
a
fruity
flavoring
the
mouthfell
is
plesant
i
good
beer
which
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
and
hopefully
the
smell
will
be
better
next
time
ommegang
rare
vos
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
this
bottle
was
brewed
in
cooperstown
the
smell
is
predominately
malty
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
the
taste
has
that
typical
belgium
character
its
fairly
light
and
a
bit
fruity
too
this
is
quite
a
good
take
on
the
style
recommended
d
very
drinkable
this
one
will
become
a
regular
for
me
its
my
first
ommegang
offering
and
i
hope
the
rest
are
this
good
overall
more
eye
candy
than
anything
else
poured
a
rich
brown
with
purplered
highlights
leaving
an
off
white
head
that
is
sticky
the
aroma
is
yeasty
figs
plums
honey
cloves
and
ginger
spices
the
feel
starts
off
highly
carbonated
moves
to
a
strong
bitter
bite
of
grapefruit
that
is
complimented
by
some
fruit
sweetness
that
finishes
slightly
harsh
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
plenty
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
really
noticeable
until
afterward
easy
to
drink
went
well
with
shrimp
scampi
and
should
work
well
with
most
foods
a
good
buy
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
head
and
active
carbonation
banana
undertones
and
a
crisp
fruity
prescence
punctuated
with
controlled
alcohol
scents
and
some
grain
pulls
through
as
well
full
taste
carbonation
sits
in
as
you
drink
it
all
the
way
down
fully
flavored
but
not
too
heavy
a
fantastic
beer
stunning
in
quality
for
the
price
pours
a
cloudy
golden
hazy
and
its
interesting
to
watch
the
carbination
rush
to
the
top
powerful
yeast
flavor
with
banana
undertones
i
was
surprised
to
detect
some
hops
mildly
dry
finish
unless
its
just
my
current
palate
influencing
it
overall
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
ommegang
and
i
am
impressed
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
offerings
the
smell
is
pleasant
with
hints
of
candy
and
citrus
on
top
of
malt
the
taste
brings
light
fruit
malt
and
good
yeast
flavors
all
the
way
through
the
mouthfeel
is
full
while
drinkability
is
very
good
drinkable
as
any
of
this
fine
brewerys
beers
just
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
its
miraculous
that
this
is
made
in
the
states
a
nice
dry
mellowedout
belgian
ale
i
could
probably
make
a
session
out
of
it
this
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
tanish
head
the
aroma
was
a
nice
bouquet
of
sweet
malts
very
enjoyable
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
hit
of
malty
goodness
with
a
bit
of
hops
but
not
overpowering
there
are
also
some
spices
in
this
one
that
work
well
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
in
my
opinion
awesome
belgium
style
brew
from
ny
what
the
hell
is
a
belgian
amber
well
ok
this
is
from
ommegang
so
ill
give
it
a
try
amber
color
and
a
bit
cloudy
smells
like
any
other
belgium
sour
tinges
nice
and
smooth
clove
malt
flavors
very
tasty
beer
not
too
hard
hitting
like
some
other
big
bad
belgians
quite
impressed
if
anyone
knows
of
belgians
that
are
similar
to
this
feel
free
to
beermail
me
the
good
news
you
may
convert
me
yet
overall
this
was
so
weak
i
could
not
believe
my
wife
drank
a
bottle
and
couldnt
believe
the
lack
of
flavor
more
like
the
watered
down
flavor
thumbs
down
until
ommegang
bumps
the
flavor
in
this
1
flavor
first
a
sourness
like
lime
a
berry
note
thoughout
theres
grains
and
a
slite
bite
in
the
end
carbonation
is
apparent
its
very
well
drinkable
this
belgian
ale
poured
out
a
dark
golden
amber
with
a
good
size
hrad
the
aromas
were
of
hopsmalt
and
citrusalso
in
the
taste
the
beer
also
was
yeatsy
and
rich
and
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
offering
from
ommegangalthough
i
do
not
believe
its
there
best
during
a
recent
tour
of
the
brewery
i
saw
that
they
add
some
flavors
to
this
near
the
end
of
boil
i
dont
remember
which
ones
i
think
coriander
is
used
for
the
hennepin
and
anise
for
the
ommegang
but
there
was
also
seeds
of
paradise
or
something
peppery
mouthfeel
is
very
light
very
clean
well
done
for
a
yankee
micro
would
stand
up
well
to
any
native
belgian
pale
i
could
definitely
session
a
few
of
these
opinion
well
this
beer
has
some
serious
age
on
it
so
it
obviously
isnt
in
its
prime
the
flavor
is
still
really
complex
and
i
would
really
like
to
try
a
really
fresh
example
i
will
be
trying
this
beer
again
for
sure
bought
this
and
hennepin
recently
i
prefer
this
one
it
is
an
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
remains
present
a
small
amount
of
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
malty
odor
to
it
mostly
sweet
there
is
a
very
nice
fruity
taste
with
some
spice
and
a
little
hoppiness
it
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
not
too
carbonated
a
very
good
beer
quite
drinkable
this
is
my
first
ever
public
review
i
felt
compelled
on
this
one
so
that
must
mean
something
poured
into
a
moinette
goblet
from
a
750
ml
bottle
as
a
lively
orange
color
with
golden
accents
big
rocky
head
of
a
cream
color
fantastic
retention
and
much
lacing
in
the
inner
rim
of
the
goblet
nose
is
lively
with
citrus
spices
white
grapes
and
fruit
salad
taste
profile
is
pleasingly
light
yet
very
complex
and
exciting
citrus
offers
a
lively
play
on
the
tongue
encouraged
in
its
performance
by
a
worthy
hop
presence
best
described
as
a
refreshing
taste
leaning
toward
hops
and
citrus
fruity
lightness
with
some
expression
of
yeast
to
add
complexity
alcohol
is
not
assertive
lightbodies
and
lively
this
is
a
great
beer
immenently
drinkable
and
userfriendly
recommended
this
is
the
first
belgian
style
ive
had
from
the
proper
glasswear
and
it
is
making
a
huge
differance
i
could
sit
and
enjoy
one
of
these
every
night
what
a
wonderful
pleasant
experience
i
cant
wait
to
revisit
some
of
the
other
belgians
ive
had
to
see
if
its
the
glass
or
the
beer
or
maybe
a
little
of
each
verdict
an
aboveaverage
wellrounded
beer
not
particularly
drinkable
i
found
it
hard
to
consume
this
750ml
bottle
which
is
strange
considering
the
amazing
hennepin
and
ommegang
interestingly
my
wife
liked
it
much
more
than
either
of
those
two
options
a
combination
of
belgian
golden
ales
and
american
ambers
incredibly
drinkable
and
endlessly
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
its
flavors
are
subtle
and
dont
hit
you
over
the
head
overall
a
good
one
but
not
a
great
one
probably
my
least
favorite
of
ommegangs
brews
see
other
review
for
more
cohesion
pours
a
deep
transparent
amber
with
big
foamy
offwhite
head
and
huge
lace
subtle
toasted
grain
flowery
hops
and
candy
sweetness
in
the
nose
mediumlight
and
strongly
carbonated
mouth
feel
yeasty
and
slightly
biscuitlike
in
initial
flavor
grows
into
big
fruitiness
before
balancing
into
a
drier
lingering
bitterness
that
is
slightly
medicinal
flavor
slightly
more
subdued
than
i
would
like
remains
a
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
amber
ale
poured
for
me
at
a
belgian
style
cafe
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
dark
orange
color
in
the
low
light
available
to
me
at
the
bar
fruity
esters
hitting
my
nose
as
i
take
a
sniff
from
my
goblet
thin
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
taste
is
also
a
nice
fruity
sweetsour
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
an
oakey
aftertaste
my
fiance
and
i
had
no
problem
finishing
it
off
with
pleasure
unfortunately
whle
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
a
little
disappointing
for
a
ommegang
this
is
a
boring
beer
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drinka
little
too
easy
to
drink
the
light
mouthfeel
lulls
you
into
thinking
this
could
be
a
session
beer
at
6
5
abv
this
could
be
a
slight
miscalculation
what
a
nice
beer
on
the
whole
this
is
a
very
sippable
and
drinkable
beer
from
ommegang
it
is
the
one
of
the
big
four
that
could
easily
be
enjoyed
all
day
without
much
of
a
problem
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
meduim
plus
bodied
very
well
balanced
sweetness
to
spicyness
just
another
dam
fine
beer
from
ommegang
another
great
selection
from
ommegang
the
2005
akorsak
brewery
of
the
year
i
love
belgian
beer
and
some
state
side
copy
cats
this
effort
wasnt
really
up
to
my
expectations
but
close
pours
a
cloudy
orange
medium
thick
white
head
forms
lots
of
lace
smell
is
malty
some
citrusfloral
hoppage
yeast
some
orange
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
taste
is
more
of
the
same
malty
with
some
chocolate
orange
spice
and
a
little
citrus
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
its
been
aging
for
a
while
with
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
taste
was
not
so
complex
maybe
because
its
been
cellaring
since
february
not
sure
if
it
would
help
or
hinder
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
some
spices
smells
promising
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
orange
and
the
spices
but
there
is
another
fruit
flavor
in
there
that
i
dont
think
mixes
well
with
the
others
just
doesnt
hit
the
palate
well
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
low
end
of
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
i
just
dont
care
much
for
the
flavor
of
this
one
very
ncie
beer
first
time
i
tried
this
offering
from
ommegang
kinda
is
rare
in
these
parts
usually
i
find
hennepin
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
smell
is
of
fruit
taste
is
of
malt
sharp
fruit
but
not
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
from
what
i
expect
from
these
guys
but
overall
it
is
pretty
good
ill
probably
stick
with
hennepin
though
since
its
my
fave
from
ommegang
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
the
texture
is
really
nice
with
the
sweet
to
bready
glow
the
alcohol
is
smooth
and
light
overall
this
is
a
dessert
deer
but
nice
to
share
with
another
person
as
advertised
it
is
mellow
as
in
the
taste
isnt
too
strong
its
certainly
a
high
quality
pale
ale
veeerrry
smooth
very
drinkable
the
taste
is
unremakrable
though
not
bland
but
not
awesome
definately
worth
a
try
woould
probably
go
great
with
a
meal
bc
the
taste
isnt
overpowering
drinkability
this
made
for
a
nice
affordable
belgian
style
ale
from
ommegang
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
them
this
made
for
another
winner
from
ommegang
very
round
soft
and
big
quite
refreshing
for
an
ale
with
such
a
malt
profile
my
favorite
of
the
excellent
offerings
from
the
ommegang
crew
if
only
there
were
more
belgianstyle
ales
of
this
caliber
produced
domestically
enjoyable
and
drinkable
another
winner
from
ommegang
and
one
ill
drink
again
often
a
flavorful
and
refreshingly
crisp
take
on
the
style
nothing
flashy
but
impressively
wellrounded
i
imagine
that
this
could
make
for
a
rather
nice
session
ale
a
dark
honey
color
with
a
huge
headpour
slowly
people
the
smell
is
not
very
strong
there
are
some
hops
with
spices
and
a
little
floral
the
taste
is
a
bit
hoppy
and
grainy
there
is
a
large
abundance
of
wheat
flavoringas
well
as
carbonation
the
after
taste
is
sweeti
can
see
having
this
with
fruit
or
dessert
this
is
a
nice
full
flavored
beer
that
i
will
buy
when
i
see
it
again
ommegang
is
top
notch
to
sweet
for
this
hophead
drinkability
very
delicious
and
refined
i
wish
more
brewers
perfected
their
craft
the
way
ommegang
has
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
can
remember
taste
is
great
and
the
alcohol
isnt
on
the
high
end
of
the
spectrum
all
these
things
make
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
its
too
bad
its
retired
im
heading
to
the
beer
store
to
stock
up
on
whatever
they
still
have
on
the
shelves
appears
rather
cloudy
with
a
yellowishbrown
color
and
mighty
head
i
smell
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
various
spices
very
intriguing
i
first
taste
the
fruit
bitterness
that
are
usually
associated
with
pale
ales
but
it
soon
follows
with
a
distinct
sweetness
as
the
brew
warms
the
sweet
character
develops
and
begins
to
dominate
the
beer
as
a
result
i
found
each
sip
to
be
unique
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
content
was
also
very
subtle
never
overpowering
or
dominating
very
complex
an
excellent
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
can
have
several
of
these
at
one
time
because
the
texture
is
a
bit
more
rough
with
the
spices
d
for
the
price
the
value
and
drinkability
of
all
of
ommegangs
beers
is
very
high
however
the
rough
carbonation
and
unique
flavor
makes
me
not
want
to
have
this
one
regularly
edit
on
second
tasting
fruitier
notes
of
peach
and
apricot
are
descernable
along
with
herbal
hops
and
none
of
the
skunk
understated
and
pleasant
this
easy
drinking
beer
is
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
the
soft
carbonation
brings
out
all
the
flavor
it
also
hides
its
6
5
alcohol
very
well
great
looking
beer
copper
orange
hazy
with
a
big
head
notes
of
orange
spice
and
some
barn
yard
smells
fairly
uneventful
drink
the
orangecitrus
and
spice
hit
again
but
nothing
that
is
worth
talking
about
very
drying
wish
id
picked
the
hennepin
drinkability
is
high
and
i
recommend
trying
this
one
wow
amazing
this
poured
a
beautiful
hazy
orange
caramelly
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
good
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
clove
is
noticeable
in
the
smell
and
fairly
dominant
in
the
taste
also
a
really
complexy
sweet
fruity
taste
here
to
me
this
brew
tastes
mor
liek
a
combination
of
their
witbier
and
a
really
interesting
amber
beer
the
spices
they
use
probably
lead
to
that
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
moderate
and
stickey
this
brew
is
insanely
drinkable
you
cant
get
enough
of
it
this
is
easily
to
drink
good
to
toast
with
bubbly
and
bright
a
recent
favorite
and
absolute
pleasure
to
review
i
like
it
and
will
probably
have
another
in
the
future
the
taste
is
greatly
refreshing
i
could
fancy
this
thing
at
any
time
of
the
day
light
and
crisp
great
sour
fruity
finish
with
a
nice
spice
complement
so
juicy
and
wet
to
the
palate
this
brew
is
light
and
complex
at
the
same
time
drinkable
as
all
get
out
you
get
a
nice
bubbly
mouth
with
some
light
fruit
flavors
and
a
spicy
finish
that
basks
in
sourness
these
are
some
pleasant
bottles
of
beer
quite
bedazzling
on
a
hot
summer
night
i
am
in
dig
of
this
overall
an
excellent
belgian
style
ale
every
category
is
near
perfect
im
surprised
this
is
averaging
a
mere
4
in
ratings
a
must
try
orange
color
with
a
small
head
definitely
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
with
some
cinnamon
and
spice
mixed
in
a
touch
of
sweetness
can
be
detected
upon
tasting
but
the
real
killer
for
me
here
was
the
carbonation
way
too
carbonated
to
make
this
something
you
can
drink
all
night
long
it
tickled
the
inside
of
my
mouth
and
hurt
the
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
something
that
could
benefit
from
being
less
caronated
and
more
wellrounded
and
balanced
tangerine
flavor
and
color
you
can
even
feel
the
carbonatinon
on
your
lips
and
in
your
throat
on
the
way
down
tooo
much
but
ok
while
rare
vos
never
recognizes
any
of
the
styles
that
are
generally
given
to
belgian
ales
it
simply
does
its
artistry
with
benevolence
grace
and
artistry
just
as
true
belgian
brewers
would
have
it
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
unibroue
glass
pours
a
dark
copper
with
some
floaties
and
two
fingers
of
creamcolored
head
good
retention
and
lacing
as
well
smell
is
a
strong
green
apple
and
citrus
fruitiness
with
a
nice
clove
spiciness
and
some
yeastiness
taste
starts
out
with
a
sugary
sweet
maltiness
but
then
hits
you
with
plesantly
sour
cherrygreen
apple
flavor
finish
is
just
a
little
spicy
and
very
crisp
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
low
side
this
is
a
really
wellbalanced
easy
drinking
belgian
aleunlike
a
lot
of
others
with
more
complexityi
could
see
myself
drinking
this
as
a
session
beer
drinkability
wasnt
expecting
the
flavor
i
got
still
tasting
it
in
my
mouth
interesting
and
enjoyable
may
not
be
for
everyone
though
i
would
have
this
again
a
very
solid
belgian
even
though
made
in
america
i
still
prefer
ommegang
abbey
and
hennepin
but
next
time
i
see
this
on
a
shelf
in
a
store
i
wont
hesitate
in
picking
one
up
it
is
light
and
easily
drinkable
with
some
great
belgian
characteristics
i
am
glad
i
have
two
more
in
the
closet
this
is
the
first
ommegang
beer
i
have
had
and
i
am
very
impressed
by
it
pours
a
hazy
light
copper
color
with
a
littlemoderate
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
floral
although
pretty
weak
taste
is
great
and
well
rounded
the
first
taste
is
of
refreshing
wheat
the
next
has
a
green
apple
taste
to
it
and
it
concludes
with
a
sour
malt
taste
overall
it
is
a
very
agreeable
beer
very
easy
to
drink
so
be
sure
to
buy
a
couple
bottles
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
smooth
very
drinkable
as
are
all
ommegang
brews
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
one
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
tasty
refreshing
lovely
to
date
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
from
ommegang
2
out
of
3
aint
bad
appears
cloudy
and
golden
amber
with
extreme
effervescence
head
is
frothy
and
rocky
white
in
hue
with
a
foamy
surface
pale
malts
lend
a
little
breadiness
to
the
aroma
which
is
well
complimented
by
ripe
bananas
a
little
citrous
and
some
grassiness
and
spice
malts
are
thick
and
extreme
in
their
breadiness
citrous
is
cleanly
bittering
with
lemons
and
bitter
orange
peel
a
little
graininess
is
there
and
also
some
grass
coriander
as
well
as
other
spices
are
present
a
little
clove
subtle
fruit
sweetness
considerably
less
than
the
nose
would
suggest
mouthfeel
is
very
full
but
broken
up
by
tons
of
carbonation
we
damn
near
broke
a
light
popping
the
cork
out
of
this
bad
boy
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
just
slightly
warming
finish
is
dry
and
clean
i
am
really
enjoying
this
offering
from
ommegang
i
never
seem
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
but
i
always
love
them
when
i
have
them
i
havent
quite
figured
that
out
yet
this
is
another
great
brew
from
ommegang
this
and
the
hennepin
are
my
two
favorite
from
them
beautiful
light
amber
body
and
a
white
head
that
stays
the
entire
glass
nice
spicy
and
fruity
aroma
and
a
spicy
hop
taste
make
this
very
refreshing
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
lime
as
well
that
really
hits
the
spot
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
bit
of
solventy
alcohol
but
it
all
works
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
quaff
but
it
doesnt
impress
me
the
way
hennepin
did
if
it
were
a
little
bit
cheaper
id
go
for
it
more
often
but
at
the
only
place
i
know
of
them
being
sold
35
miles
away
they
are
the
same
price
so
i
will
probably
go
for
more
bottles
of
hennepin
next
time
im
there
750
ml
bottle
cellared
for
roughly
a
year
carefully
poured
from
a
longstanding
chilled
bottle
its
a
perfectly
clear
orange
amber
beneath
a
bigbubbled
head
of
white
foam
that
holds
splendidly
and
leaves
some
thin
splatters
of
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
lightly
fruity
apricot
lemon
rind
orange
a
touch
corklike
or
musty
and
subtly
spicy
in
the
mouth
its
lightmedium
bodied
and
zesty
on
the
tongue
due
to
its
effervescent
carbonation
the
flavor
is
exactly
as
the
nose
suggets
it
might
be
with
a
bit
more
sweet
malt
a
touch
more
fruit
a
sprinkling
of
delicate
floral
hops
and
alot
of
peppery
spice
its
wellbalanced
but
it
relies
more
on
its
thin
maltiness
and
peppery
yeast
to
do
that
than
it
does
hop
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
and
refreshing
with
a
quick
passing
of
fruitiness
followed
by
some
lingering
chalky
dryness
the
yeast
pour
brings
out
a
little
more
character
and
lends
the
body
a
touch
of
girth
and
i
prefer
it
that
way
additionally
i
dont
feel
that
this
beer
really
gains
anything
from
cellaring
other
than
to
drop
some
of
the
yeast
out
of
suspension
a
rough
fresh
bottle
can
be
a
bit
much
overall
as
a
belgianstyle
pale
ale
this
is
right
on
the
mark
love
it
or
leave
it
750
ml
corked
bottle
hazy
apricot
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
there
is
also
fruit
mainly
oranges
and
strawberries
in
the
nose
very
spicy
smelling
the
flavor
starts
out
sweet
and
fruity
this
is
clearly
a
bottled
conditioned
beer
i
find
the
finish
too
bitter
its
not
bitter
like
hops
but
more
like
orange
peels
while
this
detracts
from
the
flavor
a
bit
the
flavor
is
still
very
nice
a
nice
beer
from
ommegang
but
not
their
best
comments
let
this
beer
warm
up
a
few
minutes
at
least
before
drinking
it
the
flavor
and
smell
dont
seem
to
match
up
for
some
reason
but
the
beer
is
still
enjoyable
this
beer
is
pretty
complex
id
say
it
is
worth
a
try
pours
a
rich
and
shiny
amber
in
color
with
a
thick
head
and
lots
of
layered
lace
aroma
is
all
lemon
sugars
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
pleasant
went
well
with
my
salmon
lemon
taragon
and
pepper
grilling
concoction
very
drinkable
i
had
to
pace
myself
or
i
was
gonna
finish
before
i
was
done
eating
flavor
is
at
first
sweet
malts
and
sugars
but
balanced
nicely
with
smoothj
hops
and
the
yeast
provides
great
antecedent
flavors
to
the
beer
very
nice
and
easily
quaffed
brew
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
hard
to
identify
any
major
flaws
the
beer
after
its
release
from
the
750ml
cork
and
wired
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
luminous
copper
color
with
a
portly
creamy
light
tan
head
that
after
decomposing
leaves
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
nicely
malted
with
light
hints
of
spice
and
plums
the
start
is
lightly
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
adequate
the
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finishing
is
punishing
in
its
acidity
the
hop
delightful
in
their
spicy
bite
very
dry
after
taste
that
lingers
long
a
good
beer
but
i
sample
only
rarely
bottle
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
floral
malt
sweet
hops
with
some
subtle
spices
and
a
touch
of
belgiantype
yeast
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
floral
sweet
malt
and
discreet
yeast
with
some
spices
body
is
just
above
average
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
for
a
belgian
ale
slàinte
just
another
of
a
long
line
of
solid
very
good
beers
from
brewery
ommegang
while
not
my
favorite
perhaps
the
sweetsour
combination
makes
the
beer
interesting
and
drinkable
the
earthy
notes
and
spicy
character
make
it
refreshing
and
while
not
amazing
the
final
impression
was
one
of
satisfaction
and
contentment
i
dont
know
how
much
more
you
can
ask
for
than
that
this
is
a
great
beer
deceivingly
easy
to
drink
as
the
alchohol
stays
disguised
in
the
tastiness
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
wasnt
that
impressive
only
a
little
better
than
average
drinkability
wasnt
that
great
overall
i
thought
it
was
ok
but
i
wouldnt
have
another
one
on
my
own
the
drinkability
considering
the
easygoing
flavours
and
mouthfeel
i
rank
quite
high
the
only
limitation
is
that
the
alcohol
goes
unnoticed
while
drinking
it
but
not
in
the
body
thats
why
i
dont
give
it
a
5
there
at
the
end
of
the
glass
i
didnt
want
another
one
and
am
hoping
that
i
wont
be
quite
so
disappointed
with
the
bottle
of
ommegang
that
ive
had
hanging
around
proper
temperature
and
proper
glassware
are
vital
for
this
beer
a
very
good
beer
this
poured
a
hazy
copper
big
frothy
head
that
left
puffs
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
smell
was
of
raisins
and
fruit
taste
was
light
fruity
and
tangy
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
tart
and
highly
carbonated
drinkability
is
fantastic
just
another
fine
product
from
ommegang
i
will
revisit
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
coper
color
with
a
great
2
finger
head
and
equally
nice
lace
smells
of
sweet
dried
fruit
cherries
raisins
plums
with
a
bit
of
spicyness
mixed
in
taste
is
similar
to
smells
but
with
an
almost
immediate
hop
spicyness
not
overpowering
but
just
enough
finishes
with
a
definate
alcohol
taste
also
noted
some
caramel
and
even
a
slight
roastiness
a
nice
belgiun
pale
and
a
deal
at
5
i
am
surprised
by
the
fact
that
this
brewery
is
american
i
could
have
sworn
this
beer
came
straight
from
belgium
an
excellent
brew
nice
full
but
not
too
full
mouthfeel
theres
lots
of
carb
but
it
doesnt
numb
the
tongue
despite
one
flaw
this
is
a
most
drinkable
beer
the
6
5abv
helps
that
too
first
taste
provided
a
spicy
tonguestinging
that
led
to
a
mildly
bitter
finish
taste
is
chock
full
o
belgian
funkiness
if
you
gulp
enough
air
with
a
swig
it
tastes
like
an
attic
or
basement
is
that
good
not
so
sure
some
metal
in
there
as
well
sometimes
sour
sometimes
tangy
no
pronounced
flavors
though
very
subtle
in
its
approach
mouth
is
thick
with
blankets
of
miniscule
bubbles
definitely
an
easy
drink
tasty
as
well
what
a
nice
touch
of
belgium
here
in
the
states
and
only
2
a
bottle
if
youre
ever
in
cooperstown
take
the
tour
of
the
brewery
its
fascinating
and
refereshing
notes
i
am
very
impressed
this
is
the
most
nonamerican
american
brewery
i
have
found
nice
to
drink
rather
light
bodied
with
ample
cascading
carbonation
smooth
and
almost
creamy
on
the
palate
overall
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
brewed
here
in
the
states

great
beer

and
a

that
cleanses
the
palate
tasty
medium
to
light
body
that
doesnt
force
itself
on
you
but
rather
gently
makes
its
presence
known
my
favorite
of
the
ommegang
line
especially
as
an
accompaniment
to
food
like
homemade
verythincrust
pizza
or
maybe
asparagus
and
spicy
sausage
this
was
to
dry
for
my
taste
the
mellowness
is
too
mellow
and
the
complexity
it
seemingly
has
just
doesnt
seem
to
really
peak
any
where
and
the
dryness
flat
out
takes
too
much
out
of
it
for
me
a
dry

hmm

brew
is

paid

for
this
750
very
affordable
offering
from
ommegang
pours
a
hazy
peachy

with
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
aromas
of
musty
mild
yeast
amber
and
crystal
malts
light
fruitiness
and
spicing
starts
off
amberishly
sweet
nuances
of
clover

then
dries
a
little
from
the
clovey
phenols
moderately
fruity
with
a
faint
nuttiness
with
a
very
slight
woody
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
a
little
bit
on
the
weak
side
yet
flavorful
one
of
the
better
u
s
brewed
belgianstyle
beers
this
one
paired
nicely
with
spicy
turkey
chili
of
the
4
new
brews
i
had
tonight
this
was
probably
the
most
dissapointing
this
beers
flavor
was
just
about
the
most
average
tasting
belgian
style
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
weak
and
not
interesting
this
left
a
bad
aftertaste
as
well
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
but
this
was
pretty
damn
rough
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
quite
well
balanced
the
interplay
between
the
smooth
fruitiness
and
the
sharp
spiciness
is
quite
complimenting
this
beer
is
definitely
a
work
of
craftsmanship
it
is
quite
well
balanced
yet
quite
flavorful
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
actually
this
might
be
the
best
beer
that
ommegang
makes
pleasing
and
straightforward
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
ommegang
offering
i
could
drink
this
all
day
even
my
beerhating
girlfriend
liked
this
one
amazing
mouthfeel
full
of
flavor
and
aroma
overall
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
makes
me
feel
like
im
enjoying
it
on
a
summers
night
in
brugge
instead
of
a
cold
dreary
night
in
akron
oh
and
for
4
99
thats
not
bad
at
all
750
ml
corked
and
bailed
bottle
the
inexpensive
price
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
there
are
plenty
of
other
bpas
id
drive
across
town
to
get
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
love
ommegang
beers
but
this
one
did
not
impress
me
not
that
its
bad
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
many
many
fine
examples
of
the
style
kind
of
sour
almost
flat
a
little
darker
in
color
than
the
usual
belgian
pale
the
la
fin
i
followed
this
with
absolutely
blew
it
away
i
know
different
style
but
still
greatbrew
750ml
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
orangecopper
color
with
a
solid
white
three
finger
head
the
smell
is
fruity
sweet
malts
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
wonderful
slight
citrous
flavor
with
a
bready
malt
goodness
and
hint
of
spice
that
is
hard
to
beat
nicely
balanced
with
a
hop
bite
that
just
noticable
enough
to
be
almost
perfect
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
were
right
on
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
the
second
trial
for
this
beer
the
first
i
thought
was
bad
somehow
but
this
one
confirms
that
i
just
dont
find
this
beer
particulary
nice
its
not
bad
really
but
its
off
flavours
dont
do
well
to
inspire
you
to
obtain
more
i
would
imagine
that
this
would
be
a
very
diverse
beer
to
pair
with
different
foods
great
drinkability
level
another
winner
from
ommegang
a
pretty
nice
stab
at
the
belgian
style
ale
from
the
people
at
ommegang
this
corked
750ml
bottle
pours
a
nice
orange
bronze
color
with
a
touch
of
haze
but
fairly
translucent
a
nice
rocky
head
rests
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
a
nice
big
boquet
of
mellow
fruit
scencts
floral
hops
and
mellow
ripe
malts
a
bit
biscuity
and
buttery
as
well
taste
is
much
the
same
a
nice
mellow
a
sweet
taste
with
hints
of
hops
and
fruits
and
malts
all
coming
at
different
times
and
a
tad
yeasty
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
this
is
definately
and
easy
beer
to
put

in

taste
a

a

of
curacao
orange
comes
in
with
a
slight
banana
note
at
the
finish
i
wish
i
couldve
keep
this
to
cellar
but
i
went
a
little
crazy
at
the
store
where
i
bought
this
near
our
motel
ended
up
buying
13
bottles
of
various
micros
and
had
to
trim
down
to
fit
in
my
luggage
the
drinkability
is
ok
and
the
after
taste
is
limited
with
some
sweetness
the
body
is
buttery
and
slick
very
full
but
not
thick
this
is
an
amber
colored
brew
that
poured
a
nice
head
that
maintains
throughout
smell
is
of
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
that
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
hop
mouthfeel
is
light
but
lively
overall
drinkability
is
near
perfect
great
bottle
for
a
great
beer
needless
to
say
i
pointed
the
top
away
from
my
face
windows
or
my
wife
upon
opening
the
head
was
very
full
and
tight
the
lacing
was
consistent
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
was
rich
with
plum
citrus
and
some
alcohol
the
beer
danced
on
my
tongue
as
the
malt
blended
well
with
the
clove
and
citrus
flavor
the
color
was
a
medium
amber
however
the
head
was
more
impressive
than
the
color
in
regards
to
appearance
the
finish
was
clean
this
was
one
good
belgian
thanks
to
wyllder
for
the
sample
appearance
was
a
bit
murky
medium
yellow
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
a
pleasant
blend
of
grassy
hops
and
yeast
taste
is
very
different
but
very
nice
it
was
light
on
the
palate
early
on
but
burst
in
a
delayed
fruity
finish
i
got
a
distinct
impression
of
pears
mouthfeel
is
very
very
smooth
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
brew
i
would
definitely
have
again
notes
this
beer
is
a
great
value
for
4
99
while
the
flavors
arent
overwhelming
in
a
medium
bodied
ale
they
are
certainly
unique
and
the
finish
definitely
will
be
recognized
by
your
taste
buds
however
when
the
finish
hits
it
is
almost
like
what
that
was
it
not
as
complex
and
hard
hitting
as
i
would
have
hoped
i
like
rare
vos
marginally
more
than
i
liked
ommegang
squared
but
it
isnt
great
beer
in
my
mind
it
isnt
overly
complex
and
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
push
my
buttons
all
that
hard
im
still
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
try
beer
is
good
happy
belgian
style
american
beering
drinkability
its
good
but
after
one
im
ready
to
move
on
ill
have
this
again
my
wife
liked
it
too
so
i
should
stock
it
this
is
a
nicely
complex
and
refined
beer
just
needs
a
bit
more
oomph
to
push
it
to
the
next
level
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
im
not
too
sure
if
i
could
drink
the
whole
750ml
bottle
gets
a
little
sour
after
a
bit
but
overall
not
too
bad
for
3
99
a
cloudy
brownish
gold
colour
topped
with
a
medium
sized
head
set
this
beer
up
for
a
first
sip
this
is
a
refined
beer
that
doesnt
scream
belgian
but
rather
whispers
it
in
the
ear
very
drinkable
and
at
6
5
abv
almost
sessionable
this
is
the
one
true
drinking
beer
from
ommegang
where
the
rest
of
their
lineup
is
strictly
sipping
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
too
this
is
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
the
rare
vos
may
be
one
of
ommegangs
best
oh
yeah
another
dangerous
one
on
the
drinkabilty
too
easy
to
have

very

with
a
lingering

drinkiability
ok
but
i
would
like
to
try
again
overall
its
a
moderately
drinkable
beer
it
is
free
of
offflavors
and
unpleasantness
an
excellent
offering
from
ommegang
that
ill
run
back
to
the
next
time
i
have
a
chance
to
buy
it
drinkability

theres
better

out
there
but
as
a
domestic
brewery
that
made
this
its
quite
decent
worth
a
try
i
always
passed
this
beer
up
getting
the

i

was
i
an

for

for
the
bottle
this
was
a
steal
the
taste
was
so
smooth
and
drinkable
almost
conversationable
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
table
beer
along
the
lines
of
a

wine
and
it
is
a
great
substitute
for
a

this
feels
weird
to
type
this
is
the
first
ommegang
product
that
hasnt
blown
me
away
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
handful
of
other
summer
ales
ive
had
its
not
something
id
feel
confident
being
able
to
pick
out
of
a
crowd
that
said
its
still
crisp
like
a
summer
ale
should
be
and
its
worth
buying
again
when
its
actually

in

it

a

offering
at
almost

its
not
wimpy
and
has
stood
up
to
a
couple
of
seasons
gone
by
o
i
love
the
flavors
that
ommegang
can
create
but
their
yeast
always
falls
short
on

that

to
have
a

of
bpas
and
they
all
kind
of
taste
the
same
very
disappointed
with
this
brew
taste
and
aroma
were
akin
to
dish
soap
laced
with

i
would
sometime
like
to
try
this
one
as
a
draught
just
to
compare
bottle
and
tap
perhaps
the
12oz
bottle
i
i
sampled
was
off
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
hops
but
just
seems
that
something
went
wrong
with
this
one
would
be
willing
to
try
again
but
at
this
point
i
would
hardly
recommend
this

finding
some

from

i
tried
a
taste
comparison
of
this

which
is
a
triple
due
to
circumstances
beyond
my
control
sort
of
like
limited

being
dramatically
close
to
my
self
imposed
abv
limit
i
ended
up
with
the
ommegang
no
regrets
but
i
will
be
looking
out
for
the
chouffe
its
robust
flavor
body
alcohol
were
impressive
but
not
of
the
moment
not
out
of
place
by
any
means
just
bad
timing
its
even
usurped
what
started
a
glowing
review
of
the
ommegang
ill
be
looking
forward
to
both
equally
in
the
future
notes
in
my
opinion
ommegang
just
keeps
on
hitting
home
runs
and
this
is
no
exception
serving
type
bottle
nothing
particularly
unique
about
this
one
just
a
very
well
done
belgian
pale
ale
overall
was
quite
impressed
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
make
a
night
out
of
o
a
very
good
beer
my
third
enjoyable
beer
from
ommegang
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
example
of
how
an
ale
can
be
full
of
big
hop
flavors
lots
of
well
balanced
citrus
and
sweetness
and
a
nice
light
toasted
malt
feel
back
this
one
up
a
beautiful
easy
to
drink
beer
with
no
glaring
faults
i
found
it
real
enjoyable
o
the
bottle
and
label
including
the
name
evokes
belgium
to
me
especially
the
poperings
region
where
hops
are
so
celebrated
in
summer
the
taste
stands
up
to
the
style

name
got

cheers
this
seemed
to
be
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
was
ruined
at
every
turn
by
one
deterring
detail
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
really
nicely
constructed
summer
brew
a
nice
combination
of
a
traditional
belgian
pale
ale
with
some
heavier
flavors
of
citrus
and
a
touch
more
hops
than
usual
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
with
well
hidden
alcohol
overall
outstanding
so
much
going
on
with
this
beer
and
great
for
the
summer
another
masterpiece
from

here

malts
yeast
some
fruitiness
a
bit
of
hops
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
straw
in
the
glass
and
if
you
look
close
what
appears
to
be
fine
suspended
yeast
noticeable
medium
carbonation
makes
this
an
attractive
and
inviting
looking
beer
the
nose
is
immediate
and
strongly
of
clove
crisp
and
refreshing
it
tastes
of
clove
and
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
wheat
a
truly
original
experience
for
me
a
pretty
solid
belgian
ale
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
thought
the
extra
hops
worked
pretty
well
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
lived
up
to
being
called
a
summer
ale
this
beer
had
very
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
clean
very
crisp
slightly
fizzy
not
filling
refreshing
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
with
no
problem
especially
on
warm
day
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
good
belgian
style
summer
ale
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
it
was
very
good
and
i
liked
how
refreshing
it
was
its
just
what
i
look
for
in
a
summer
time
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
wasnt
a
single
thing
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
but
do
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
cheaper
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
a
few
bottles
around
throughout
the
summer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
style
beers
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
satisfied
my
urge
for
a
nice
summer
time
brew
and
i
thought
it
really
hit
the
spot
this
isnt
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
or
my
favorite
beer
from
brewery
ommegang
but
i
think
its
very
solid
and
as
far
as
a
belgian
style
summer
ale
this
would
have
to
be
my
favorite
great
job
you
guys
really
know
how
to
make
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
belgian
style
beers
keep
up
the
great
work
overall
i
dont
know
belgian
style
brews
that
well
yet
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
my
second
time
trying
it
o
once
again
ommegang
delivers
belgian
style
beers
are
not
my
absolute
favorite
but
i
am
truly
enjoying
this
beer
a
refreshing
summer
brew
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
o
not
a
bad
beer
the
aroma
was
the
best
part
hops
and
body
a
bit
too
high
to
make
this
an
amazing
beer
not
entirely
sessionable
which
it
should
be
for
this
self
described
summer
ale
light
gold
and
a
bit
hazy
with
a
bright
white
cap
decent
head
retention
with
a
bit
of
foamy
lacing
aromas
of
lemony
citrus
straw
a
bit
yeastybready
quite
floral
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected
moderate
bitterness
that
lingered
citrus
and
floral
a
hint
of
spiciness
lively
carbonation
light
bodied
offdry
and
quite
drinkable
really
nice
balance
and
well
constructed
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
again
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
body
with
massive
head
and
lace
that
dies
quick
with
some
lace
the
aroma
has
a
little
bit
of
yeast
but
mostly
a
floral
hop
presence
that
isnt
just
citric
but
gives
off
touches
of
grape
or
sweet
apple
and
i
swear
there
are
some
other
sweet
fruits
in
the
aroma
beer
is
smooth
and
sweet
and
real
light
definitely
designed
for
hot
summer
days
the
floral
hops
give
off
a
crispness
that
complements
the
smoothness
of
yeast
and
some
other
fruit
not
quite
tropical
but
more
like
pear
sweetness
for
a
well
balanced
and
composed
beer
an
amazing
beer
it
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
small
quickly
fading
head
it
smells
of
hops
with
balanced
malt
and
notes
of
lemon
and
herb
like
back
ground
the
taste
is
beautifully
balanced
with
excellent
malt
leading
into
clean
hops
a
perfect
transition
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
champagne
with
a
very
light
body
and
complex
small
bubbles
that
would
be
perfect
with
shellfish
or
other
light
preparations
of
seafood
a
very
nice
beer
it
has
springtime
written
all
over
rjt
the
rest
another
solid
beer
from
ommegang
a
nice
funky
changeup
from
the
typical
summer
ale
overall
a
very
refreshing
yet
complex
summer
ale
the
balance
of
spicy
yeast
and
hops
aromas
is
well
crafted
one
of
the
better
summer
ales
ive
tasted
o
i
absolutely
love
what
ommegang
has
done
here
a
pleasantly
hopped
golden
ale
that
flaunts
its
effortless
balance
and
complexity
fleur
de
houblon
is
a
fun
and
easy
beer
to
drink
wellsuited
for
summer
but
delicious
anytime
the
new
seasonal
lineup
has
been
fantastic
thus
far
more
bitter
than
most
of
ommegangs
offerings
again
theres
a
harsh
yeast
bite
geometry
hop
in
the
background
but
its
not
prominent
the
aftertaste
is
better
on
the
hop
bitterness
but
this
still
the
tale
of
a
strong
belgian
yeast
flavor
overall
a
superior
hop
driven
belgian
pale
o
hands
down
the
best
summer
brew
or
belgian
pale
ive
ever
had
might
give
3p
a
run
for
its
money
as
my
favorite
ommegang
offering
overy
refreshing
brew
that
is
easy
drinking
a
very
tasty
citrusy
lemony
flowery
brew
very
refreshing
and
crisp
excellent
for
summer
but
also
complex
enough
to
satisfy
year
round
while
the
hops
may
be
substantial
they
dont
seem
to
overpower
this
beer
in
any
way
i
wish
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
to
try
this
and
instead
started
drinking
it
first
thing
in
the
summer
or
when
it
was
available
really
nice
and
solid
its
got
a
big
head
but
isnt
over
carbonated
light
dry
and
crisp
but
has
a
nice
floral
nose
and
taste
along
with
apples
pears
and
a
hint
of
citrus
and
even
some
minty
cilantro
notes
theres
definitely
some
belgian
backbone
but
it
has
good
hop
presence
very
unique
od
more
of
a
belgian
ipa
but
its
all
pretty
similar
a
nice
hoppy
belgian
blonde
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
liked
it
alot
serving
type
bottle
from
a
carton
of
4
it
was
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
enjoyed
with
punch
that
didnt
upset
the
palate
or
my
head
but
i
knew
it
wasnt
a
session
beer
or
some
junk
i
used
to
pound
in
college
i
wanted
another
one
after
my
first
and
that
is
usually
my
mark
of
something
i
feel
strongly
enough
to
leave
a
review
for
plus
it
has
been
a
while
nb
this
is
not
a
personal
favorite
style
i
reviewed
it
as
a
representation
of
what
it
is
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
goldenyellow
coloring
almost
opaque
with
a
tall
frothy
bright
white
head
with
huge
bubbles
and
good
retention
aromas
of
pineapple
honey
pepper
biscuit
lemon
and
subtle
resiny
bitterness
flavors
are
spice
forward
with
a
lemony
sweet
and
tart
backbone
blended
with
biscuit
notes
hops
bitterness
and
spice
creep
in
at
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
with
a
more
robust
spice
bouquet
also
present
bitter
and
tart
citrus
blend
into
the
aftertaste
with
grassy
and
cedar
notes
light
effervescent
body
keeps
the
palate
light
the
finish
is
light
frothy
and
clean
with
only
a
hint
of
citrus
linger
very
drinkable
and
a
great
warm
weather
drinker
overall
this
brewer
can
do
no
wrong
another
winner
a
fantastic
summer
beer
with
more
than
enough
flavour
to
stay
interesting
throughout
the
glass
simple
layered
tasty
drinkable
exactly
what
you
want
from
a
pale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
yellow
into
my
pint
glass
giant
head
that
is
slow
to
dissipate
a
variety
of
bubbles
and
ends
up
with
thick
beautiful
lacing
floral
scent
but
noticeable
maltiness
to
it
as
well
taste
is
of
a
lighter
floral
hop
with
a
respectable
substance
to
it
balanced
with
just
a
bit
of
malt
there
is
a
certain
spiceness
to
it
too
both
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
which
makes
this
a
unique
brew
mouthfeel
is
like
that
of
a
carbonated
mineral
water
heavier
and
spicier
though
aftertaste
is
more
yeasty
with
a
hit
of
floral
hops
but
quickly
fades
and
doesnt
continue
to
develop
overall
recommended
o
i
rather
enjoyed
this
a
light
and
refreshing
brew
with
enough
hop
kick
to
keep
things
interesting
the
aroma
was
especially
pleasurable
overall
a
great
expression
of
pure
green
hops
in
a
nicely
balanced
summer
brew
this
one
is
two
cuts
above
the
rest
and
hits
it
out
of
double
day
park
really
in
a
league
of
its
own
when
it
comes
to
summer
beers
my
favorite
by
far
im
not
a
fan
of
the
phenol
so
this
is
a
tough
one
for
me
i
like
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
but
would
much
prefer
it
without
the
bubblegum
and
bandaid
characters
fairly
complex
beer
with
enough
bittering
to
counter
the
esters
but
not
overwhelm
price
point
10
50
4pk
12
oz
bottles
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
nose
but
there
is
a
bit
more
of
a
citrus
bite
and
a
slightly
lingering
peppery
finish
this
has
jumped
top
the
of
my
summer
ale
list
overall
the
perfect
summer
ale
not
heavy
and
filling
but
very
good
flavor
and
smoothness
overall
i
should
stock
up
on
six
packs
of
this
stuff
it
is
hugely
quaffable
despite
its
abv
and
it
just
suits
my
palate
very
well
overall
an
amzing
enjoyable
beer
i
dont
believe
i
have
had
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
is
just
perfect
for
summer
on
tap
at
the
source
this
very
light
belgian
summer
beer
is
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
after
a
long
drive
through
the
eastern
new
your
countryside
it
pours
a
pale
golden
color
more
yellow
really
with
a
fair
bit
of
suspended
sediment
and
a
huge
creamy
white
head
that
is
continually
rising
rather
than
falling
i
smell
grassy
hops
very
light
wheat
malt
and
the
slightest
spice
kick
the
taste
is
quite
herbal
with
the
hops
giving
more
flavor
than
bitterness
and
the
malt
being
light
enough
to
allow
this
awesome
belgian
yeast
to
be
prominent
the
finish
is
really
clean
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
lightness
in
feel
of
this
beer
impressed
me
the
most
and
the
floral
and
herbal
profile
of
the
hops
is
a
nice
seasonal
touch
carbonation
on
par
with
the
rest
of
the
ommegang
lineup
this
is
an
excellent
summer
drink
also
really
fantastic
with
a
splash
of
the
fruitesse
raspberry
beer
thats
also
on
tap
at
the
brewery
ommegang
can
do
no
wrong
b
ommegang
is
stepping
out
of
their
comfort
zone
with
this
one
they
just
dont
do
hoppy
beers
but
im
liking
what
they
did
o
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
good
balance
of
flavors
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
medium
to
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
which
are
appropriate
for
the
style
the
carbonation
pushes
towards
fizziness
but
never
arrives
there
leading
to
a
softly
effervescent
then
foamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
goes
well
with
this
floral
and
mild
citrusleaning
beer
closes
semidry
with
fairly
substantial
stickiness
lingering
on
the
tongue
and
lips
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
fresh
hops
and
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
in
the
taste
fresh
hops
with
a
minty
burn
with
a
lemon
zest
sweetness
a
hop
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dryer
fresh
hop
and
notes
of
lemon
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
nice
hop
presence
and
quite
refreshing
with
lemon
zest
ommegang
never
fails
to
delight
and
this
is
a
refreshing
and
well
made
summer
ale
that
will
quench
your
thirst
and
delight
the
palate
elegant
yet
earthy
the
citrus
makes
your
mouth
water
and
then
the
apple
quenches
your
thirst
the
hops
are
gentle
to
the
drink
and
accentuate
the
fruit
especially
the
lime
imaginative
and
airy
overall
very
good
beer
that
took
me
by
suprise
its
smooth
but
ridiculously
strong
in
flavors
that
it
might
overwhelm
you
just
a
but
you
will
appreciate
it
a
beer
best
served
well
done
salud
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
odwas
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
so
much
very
unique
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
bpas
from
belgium
cut
more
in
my
mold
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
summer
seasonal
it
hits
all
the
refreshing
notes
needed
on
a
hot
day
but
shows
tons
of
complex
character
as
well
very
impressed
but
certainly
not
surprised
as
ommegang
is
consistently
good
tastefloral
hops
spiciness
clean
dry
finish
refreshing
and
complex
reminiscient
of
a
fresh
farmhouse
ale
or
a
young
saison
very
nice
poured
from
tap
into
pint
at
the
lumberyard
in
georgetown

its

of
those
beers
i

a
well

and
one
warm
weather
fans
could
add
to
their
arsenal
of
summer
style
ales
im
not
sure
id
drink
this
over
hennepin
but
it
is
a
very
good
ale
given
its
characteristics
and
style
format
definitely
something
a
bit
different
and
hits
the
phrase
summer
ale
on
the
head
if
you
like
the
literally
flowery
hopped
brew
then
this
is
for
you
its
bright
and
beautiful
and
every
drink
reminds
you
of
bright
floral
occasions

this
beer
is
somewhere
between
hefeweizen
and
hoppy
saison
excellent
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
in
the
winter
im
very
impressed
at
what
ommegang
has
done
here
they
have
really
struck
a
wonderful
balance
between
flavors
hoppy
yeasty
wheaty
strength
and
body
wow
a
pleasant
early
summer
surprise
a
really
solid
belgian
pale
nicely
hoppy
too
really
enjoyable
bring
on
the
salads
cheese
and
crusty
bread
well
worth
a
try
overall
not
bad
decent
for
a
summer
beer
that
doesnt
get
too
light
or
fruity
but
still
brings
a
nice
hop
character
and
without
getting
too
powerful
for
a
summer
beer
great
sour
beer
pardon
me
bpa
refreshing
and
very
well
balance
in
all
senses
highly
recommended
pale
golden
body
was
hazy
and
a
large
four
finger
thick
head
formed
rapidly
despite
me
pouring
the
beer
very
gently
the
look
reminded
me
a
lot
of
duvel
but
the
floral
hoppy
smell
was
evocative
more
of
an
ipa
besides
the
hops
there
were
spicy
dusty
smells
imparted
by
the
house
yeast
strain
the
taste
was
a
great
combination
of
typical
belgian
pale
ale
flavors
of
banana
papaya
melon
and
white
pepper
and
a
distinctive
hop
character
the
finish
was
somewhat
tart
and
spicy
the
body
was
light
and
alcohol
well
hidden
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
refreshing
take
on
the
style
overall
a
pretty
sweet
summer
ale
the
abv
is
on
par
with
an
ipa
and
it
has
a
pretty
constant
hop
presence
i
would
get
it
again
but
i
dont
really
see
it
around
i
believe
i
paid
3
39
for
the
single
which
is
pretty
high
for
repeated
purchase
the
body
is
pretty
light
and
its
quiet
a
refreshing
beer
its
a
nice
summer
belgian
ipa
style
beer
a
beautifully
complex
brew
summer
ales
are
ostensibly
simple
and
light
but
this
one
is
sublimely
bitter
with
an
enduring
aftertaste
without
being
heavy
boasts
a
6
8
abv
but
still
feels
summery
has
that
distinctive
ommegang
tingly
mouthfeel
poured

ommegang
continues
to
be
a
consistently
fine
brewer
of
belgian
inspired
ales
d
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
besides
their
main
lineup
that
i
have
had
from
ommegang
in
a
while
very
balanced
refreshing
just
a
well
made
beer
that
fits
the
bpa
style
nicely
doesnt
even
drink
close
to
its
abv
good
spice
forward
pale
with
good
a
good
hoppy
edge
i
forget
how
much
this
goes
for
but
i
might
have
to
pick
up
a
pack
of
it
very
good
balance
of
yeast
and
hops
in
a
beer
that
drinks
about
3
percent
lower
than
the
listed
abv
but
delivers
as
much
flavor
as
it
should
well
crafted
this
is
a
very
floral
and
slightly
fruity
pale
ale
the
detractor
to
me
is
the
carbonation
too
full
and
hits
the
mouth
too
much
its
nice
sure
but
its
not
quite
where
id
want
to
be
for
the
style
always
nice
to
try
something
different
from
ommegang
pours
a
perfectly
clear
golden
color
white
short
lived
topping
that
recedes
to
a
ring
no
lacework
to
speak
of
really
aroma
of
rustic
belgian
yeast
and
hop
flowers
bread
wildflower
honey
pale
malts
in
the
taste
solid
funk
good
earthy
herbal
bitterness
and
a
refreshing
tartness
that
really
ties
everything
together
light
to
medium
bodied
dry
as
hell
enjoyable
very
belgian
summer
beer
for
people
of
taste
i
only
had
one
in
in
a
sitting
but
i
could
have
easily
downed
all
4
since
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
there
wasnt
any
lingering
spice
after
i
finished
off
the
contents
of
my
pint
glass
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
ommegang
and
would
quickly
enter
my
summer
rotation
if
i
wasnt
going
to
finish
the
rest
of
them
off
in
a
matter
of
days
overall
this
beer
has
great
appeal
for
the
style
and
is
precise
in
balance
and
the
taste
is
super
fresh
and
thirst
quenching
another
great
beer
from
ommegang
this
is
a
damn
fine
bpa
and
a
refreshing
addition
to
the
summer
lineup
this
may
well
be
in
the
fridge
for
months
a
fine
fine
summer
brew
thats
very
good
and
refreshing
and
has
nice
depth
of
flavor
ive
tried
a
couple
belgian
ipas
previously
and
found
i
didnt
like
the
combination
of
belgian
yeast
and
big
ibus
fleur
de
houblon
was
more
to
my
liking
with
a
strong
hop
citric
hop
presence
that
did
not
overpower
the
bpa
flavor
o
this
is
a
solidly
made
well
done
beer
ommegang
continues
to
be
one
of
the
more
consistent
breweries
out
there
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
admittedly
i
havent
had
too
many
belgian
pale
ales
but
this
is
exactly
what
id
expect
from
one
it
has
all
of
the
complexity
of
a
tripel
without
the
strength
of
a
tripel
the
only
aspect
id
like
to
see
enhanced
in
this
beer
is
the
hop
character
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
this
pale
ale
with
more
late
addition
hops
that
add
similar
spicy
notes
as
bravo
like
saaz
but
its
a
beer
that
will
quench
any
palate
on
a
warm
summer
day
in
fact
it
might
be
the
perfect
beer
for
that
purpose

extremely

o
really
nice

a

brew
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
traditional
one
dimensional
summer
brews
overall
refreshing
and
likable
o
sort
of
bridges
between
being
a
belgian
witte
with
strong
yeast
and
hops
profiles
and
a
bpa
with
some
wheat
character
o
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
shouldnt
have
been
because
ommegang
has
been
making
belgianstyle
beers
really
well
for
sometime
they
must
have
like
a
proprietary
yeast
that
they
use
because
it
is
present
in
most
of
their
beers
it
works
better
for
some
than
others
but
it
is
spoton
in
this
beer
at
times
fuzzy
and
rich
enough
to
suggest
a
tripel
but
then
it
lightens
as
it
dries
like
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
from
a
little
known
region
of
belgium
beerbrewing
called
cooperstown
ny
a
must
for
fans
of
the
style
obviously
but
a
beer
anyone
would
enjoy
the
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
slight
golden
hue
clear
with
some
hazy
sediment
and
a
huge
pillowy
white
head
that
laces
the
nose
is
rather
potent
with
big
notes
of
lemon
rind
a
slight
bubblegum
fruit
cocktail
and
a
bit
of
yeast
the
taste
is
way
more
potent
than
expected
packing
in
the
american
ipa
citrus
hop
punch
to
the
jaw
and
residual
hop
breath
obviously
with
great
yeast
presence
and
a
spicy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
bodied
and
drinkable
with
a
hoppy
but
not
bitter
yeasty
but
not
bready
nor
gum
bally
slightly
floral
semidry
tangy
aftertaste
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
i
cant
get
past
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
this
is
all
that
i
want
in
a
sessionesque
dipa
minus
the
bodysweetness
mixed
with
an
approachable
belgian
golden
ale
very
lovely
beer
and
will
likely
not
disappoint
those
looking
for
hops
yeast
or
a
delicious
hybrid
overall
as
usual
with
ommegang
very
tasty
a
nice
mix
of
belgium
pale
ale
a
wheat
ale
and
a
sour
ale
easy
to
drink
nothing
is
over

bolstered
by

there
was

this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
always
like
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
and
ommegang
when
they
do
them
do
them
well
the
fact
that
this
is
moderately
hopped
with
wholecone
bravo
hops
makes
it
a
perfect
beer
to
my
taste
for
the
summer
the
hop
character
while
not
as
fresh
and
clear
as
it
could
should
be
is
still
present
and
adds
a
nice
dimension
even
now
id
love
to
see
this
become
an
annual
seasonal
release
o
went
into
this
one
with
no
expectations
and
it
really
blew
me
away
bpas
are
not
one
of
the
styles
i
seek
out
a
lot
but
this
one
was
fantastic
i
dont
know
how
this
beer
has
escaped
my
radar
but
at
least
it
comes
to
an
end
now
it
pours
a
hazy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
light
greens
light
black
pepper
very
light
clove
and
a
hint
of
artificial
easter
candy
that
may
have
sounded
negative
but
the
combination
somehow
works
pretty
well
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
cracked
wheat
some
lemon
zest
more
clove
and
a
pinch
of
coriander
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
little
bpa
nothing
truly
special
but
something
pretty
darn
drinkable
an
outstanding
summer
beer
o
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
it
is
definitely
an
american
take
on
a
belgian
beer
but
it
is
very
well
done
it
is
a
very
approachable
aromatic
and
drinkable
summer
beer
pours
a
brilliant
happy
yellow
color
crowned
with
an
expectedly
huge
frothy
purewhite
head
that
fills
up
my
tulip
to
the
top
with
rocky
foamy
goodness
aromas
are
initially
grassy
and
floral
with
a
doughy
sweetness
clove
and
peppery
yeast
funky
lemon
bubblegum
and
increased
dried
fruity
esters
as
the
head
dies
down
spicy
herbal
hops
yeast
bright
orange
zest
hay
and
lemon
really
well
done
creamy
not
particularly
effervescent
but
dry
and
still
quite
refreshing
excellent
bottle
pours
a
hazy
darker
yellow
color
with
ginormously
thick
white
head
on
it
nose
is
a
little
hard
to
get
at
with
the
huge
head
but
i
can
get
some
of
the
spice
elements
to
it
taste
has
the
same
bit
of
spiciness
to
it
and
ends
up
being
just
a
tad
sour
and
dry
nothing
special
to
me
overall
a
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
brew
very
enjoyable
and
great
for
the
summer
weather
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
just
so
many
bpas
that
i
like
better
i
may
seek
this
one
out
in
bottle
form
to
see
if
there
may
have
been
a
tap
issue
involved
oanother
solid
beer
from
ommegang
a
nice
summer
seasonal
great
appearance
huge
creamy
white
head
that
held
for
a
long
time
and
has
great
lacing
the
smell
was
citrusy
and
earthy
but
thats
about
it
taste
is
interesting
heartburn
after
4
big
sips
very
lithely
hoppy
tons
of
citrus
and
a
nice
yeasty
character
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
and
mildly
efflorescent
mouthfeelonce
again
very
much
of
a
summer
beer
that
is
reminiscent
of
summerfest
or
porch
rocker
low
hop
profile
makes
it
an
easy
beer
for
afternoons
at
the
beach
little
carbonation
ensures
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
pretty
good
was
hoping
this
would
be
hoppier
might
buy
this
again
not
convinced
that
i
would
in
most
cases
bready
yeasty
and
floral
nice

with
plenty

between
the

and
whole
bravo

additions
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
ommegang
offering
unlike
anything
ive
tried
recently
homerun
for
complexity
and
refreshment
a
rather
approachable
bpa
especially
in
this
format
a
fourpack
labeled
summer
ale
the
people
that
are
going
to
spring
for
this
are
going
to
be
pleasantly
surprised
and
hopefully
turned
on
a
nice
smack
of
hops
with
a
modest
bitter
aftertaste
some
bready
flavors
with
that
fragrant
hoppiness
and
a
restrained
drying
yeastiness
a
very
satisfying
lighter
sort
of
beer
with
a
pleasing
belgian
character
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
olive
tree
market
in
ocean
beach
ill
get
a
six
pack
if
i
can
find
one
o
this
is
a
good
saisonlike
beer
i
like
what
the
hops
do
here
refreshing
for
summer
o
this
is
a
really
solid
summer
beer
its
light
but
complex
its
sweet
but
spicy
its
belgian
in
style
and
super
drinkable
i
might
be
drinking
quite
a
bit
of
this
beer
this
summer
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
hazy
golden
with
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
and
a
thick
white
head
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
pilsner
malt
and
lots
of
floral
hops
with
some
citrus
in
the
nose
as
well
i
also
get
some
peppery
notes
with
clove
and
maybe
a
bit
of
a
tropical
fruit
note
the
flavors
are
quite
complex
and
live
up
to
the
bright
nose
i
get
the
floral
hops
citrus
tropical
fruits
pepper
and
bready
pilsner
malt
along
with
the
banana
and
clove
flavors
from
the
yeast
it
has
strong
saison
like
characteristics
in
the
flavor
and
everything
comes
together
excellently
the
body
is
medium
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
and
this
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
despite
clocking
in
at
near
6
8
abv
this
is
an
excellent
beer
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
the
belgian
pale
ale
crisp
and
easy
drinking
for
summer
but
still
packs
a
good
punch
solid
fruity
and
grassy
taste
the
beer
gave
off
a
yellow
hazy
yeast
color
with
white
head
that
just
stood
up
upon
first
smelling
the
beer
i
thought
that
it
was
a
combo
belgian
and
hefe
it
had
that
sweetness
you
would
expect
from
the
belgian
but
with
a
banana
pepper
and
clove
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
followed
the
nose
really
well
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
perhaps
combining
two
of
my
favorite
styles
the
beer
had
a
lighter
feel
than
expected
but
this
did
not
detract
from
the
beer
as
it
still
had
a
nice
smooth
almost
creamy
feel
it
had
a
clean
dry
finish
overall
another
stellar
beer
from
one
of
the
best
in
the
land
dude
its
freakin
ommegang
o
bought
it
on
sight
laser
beam
style
having
not
known
of
about
it
i
hoped
for
the
best
based
on
my
faith
in
ommegang
expectations
exceeded
theyre
inventing
a
kind
of
belgian
triple
mixed
with
a
hoppy
summer
ale
almost
like
a
668
from
nebco
a
sublime
well
hopped
belgianesque
beer
straw
coloured
and
hazy
enormous
klingy
head
earthy
haylike
hops
with
lemon
and
black
pepper
notes
as
well
sharp
hoppy
attack
up
front
lemon
zest
and
soft
bready
malt
in
the
middle
finish
is
dry
with
a
pleasant
bitter
black
pepper
flavour
this
beer
bears
more
than

im
a
fan
overall
very
nice
hoppy
ale
from
ommegang
while
not
like
what
most
craft
breweries
do
this
is
their
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
and
i
like
it
hazy
gold
big
build
of
white
foam
that
deflates
into
random
clumps
sharp
but
unique
hoppiness
prominent
lime

malt
is
simple
clean
crisp
pale
malt
crackery
wheat
some
light
spice
and
fruit
from
the
belgian
yeast
but
it
pretty
much
stays
in
the
background
and
lets
the
hops
shine
bitterness
is
smooth
despite
the
bright
hop
flavors
dry
really
dry
and
crisp
a
really
tasty
beer
for
warm
weather
drinking
bright
juicy
hops
combined
with
the
clean
and
dry
finish
lend
superb
drinkability
ommegangs
first
real
hoppy
beer
is
belgian
at
heart
even
with
slightly
muted
belgianesque
character
the
hops
elevate
with
all
that
rustic
earthen
charm
that
those
hops
allow
its
a
seriously
drinkable
ale
with
a
bitter
cloak
i
really
liked
this
one
a
delicious
belgian
pale
in
an
easytodrink
12
ounce
bottle
that
ill
definitly
have
in
my
fridge
bring
on
summer
and
bring
on
the
fleur
de
houblon
o
outstanding
hotweather
stuff
in
the
upper
tier
of
ommegangs
expanding
lineup
of
belgian
pales
o
on
the
better
side
of
the
summer
wheat
style
complex
another
solid
ommegang
offering
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
super
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
fruit
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
floral
and
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
somewhat
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
belgian
aspects
in
the
aromas
and
flavors
d
this
beer
screams
summer
complex
and
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
this
year
pretty
good
bpa
i
enjoy
the
good
hop
notes
in
this
brew
and
the
belgian
style
background
is
well
crated
as
always
by
ommegang
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
ommegang
its
a
great
spring
beer
and
one
ill
look
forward
to
having
again
its
not
overly
hoppy
as
one
would
think
by
the
description
on
the
label
its
kinda
like
a
mix
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
pale
ale
with
added
hop
notes
a
nice
blend
of
malt
tart
hay
funk
and
hops
not
overly
doing
it
in
any
category
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
this
would
work
great
in
the
hot
whether
i
personally
think
ive
enjoyed
other
bpa
attempts
by
ommegang
a
little
more
but
this
is
no
slouch
at
all
and
well
crafted
o
take
a
hopped
up
wheat
pale
ale
ferment
it
with
belgian
yeast
bottle
condition
it
with
brett
it
doesnt
make
a
ton
of
sense
but
it
is
different
well
done
and
delicious
overall
the
subtitle
summer
ale
says
it
all
this
is
a
very
good
bpa
from
a
brewery
that
consistently
produces
solid
beer
given
that
there
were
no
reviews
up
for
it
i
took
the
chance
on
this
one
and
i
do
not
regret
it
in
the
slightest
the
beer
is
very
balanced
and
very
refreshing
and
it
is
perfectly
suited
to
drinking
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
day
the
problem
is
that
i
would
like
it
to
be
less
balanced
and
more
hop
forward
in
order
to
live
up
to
the
name
and
the
hop
that
is
the
logo
the
6
8
is
a
bit
high
for
what
is
essentially
a
quaffer
but
you
do
not
taste
that
at
all
give
this
a
shot
if
only
to
have
another
nice
summer
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
different
flavor
profile
alongside
the
typical
pale
ales
and
weizens

o
excellent
beer
and
will
most
certainly
buy
this
when
i
see
it
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
a
rather
poor
blond
definitely
not
up
to
par
with
the
others
in
its
class
very
refreshing
beer
can
definitely
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
from
the
bottle
a
very
crisp

beer
that
hides
what
little
alcohol
is
in
it
well

easy
to
drink
taste
of

apples

and
some
spice
sure
you
can
have
it
any
time
but
it
doesnt
really
offer
anything
to
me
just
a
correcto
beer
overall
really
tasty
and
was
considering
a
second
one
despite
the
outrageous
price
tag
a
given
with
the
arc
de
triumph
sitting
prominently
in
the
background
but
definitely
a
good
one

a

it
i
cant
understand
why
these
beers
get
lumped
into
the
belgian
pale

category
theyre
blond

clearly
a

this
beer
was
to
lager
like
for
me
it
tasted
almost
like
a
macro
brew
a
rather
contrived
sort
of
feeling
is
what
i
get
around
this
one
seemingly
true
to
style
but
more
than
a
bit
too
sweet
at
the
same
rate
drinkable
sure
but
lacking
the
integrated
complexity
of
its
brethren
overall
drinkability
very
tasty
beer
went
fantastic
with
steak
and
green
beans
i
could
easily
have
had
another
one
and
probably
another
after
that
dangerously
drinkable
simple
but
well
done
and
tasty
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
at
this
point
the
best
new
beer
i
had
on
the
trip
nice
nose
full
of
bananas
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
poured
clear
and
brilliant
blonde
with
a
white
head
of
creamy
foam
that
stayed
well
bubbles
streaming
up

real
looker
the
foam
finally
fell
to
some
outrageous
thick
lace
nose
is
light
positively
gay
with
brett
belgian
yeast
and
some
apple
malt
opens
up
as
it
warms
with
a
little
nut
bread
and
grain
slight
vinegar
smell
at
first
and
then
floral
taste
is
more
malt
than
the
nose
with
plenty
of
biscuit
bread
and
caramel
beside
a
tart
sour
apple
yeast
takes
a
backseat
theres
a
touch
of
booze
and
its
chewy
with
almost
no
bitterness
finishes
wet
and
without
much
aftertaste
except
for
a
very
mild
slick
hop
resin
on
the
tongue
very
light
and
delicate
goes
down
very
sweet
and
has
a
thin
body
for
some
reason
it
just
doesnt
feel
like
beer
overall
this
is
a
belgian
style
blond
i
rather
like
it
finishes
on
the
drier
side
with
more
triple
like
characteristics
all
while
maintaining
a
relatively
smooth
but
warming
flavor
throughout
the
taste
quite
tasty
o
this
is
a
pleasant
wellmade
beer
it
is
not
as
complex
as
the
best
examples
of
belgian
pales
but
it
is
simple
and
drinkable
while
having
many
of
the
tastes
and
aromas
youd
expect
o
very
nice
represent
of
blond
alescould
drink
it
often
a
decent
belgian
pale
too
many
other
solid
ones
out
there
to
give
this
one
much
praise
overall
not
very
special
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
either
id
expected
a
bit
more
bitterness
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
but
this
is
a
very
run
of
the
mill
belgian
blonde
overall
i
liked
it
however
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
was
not
what
i
look
for
or
expect
from
a
belgian
good
beer
overall
just
not
by
belgian
standards
in
my
eyes
o
can
see
why
some
would
like
this
and
some
not
balance
of
spice
floral
and
citrus
makes
for
varied
opinions
definitely
not
a
session
beer
d
rjt
o
smooth
and
gulpable
no
matter
the
abv
kind
of
a
nice
summerbrew
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
forms
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
yeast
and
some
light
fruit
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
mineral
aroma
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
much
the
same
sans
minerals
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
prefer
the
taste
over
the
smell
on
this
one
overall
a
refreshing
and
tasty
belgian
pale
whose
character
is
right
up
my
alley
overall
enough
redeeming
qualities
to
interest
me
in
the
rest
of
the
brewers
lineup
but
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
any
time
soon
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
devilthemed
belgian
golden
strong
ales
which
aside
from
duvel
and
a
few
us
interpretations
i
usually
dont
dig
pours
a
clear
yellow
body
with
a
tall
white
head
aroma
of
grain
yeast
grass
mustiness
cereal
florals
and
pepper
flavor
of
yeast
grass
florals
herbs
the
taste
was
fine
a
slight
tangy
bite
with
some
citrus
fruits
trying
to
get
out
the
mouth
drys
quickly
leaving
a
metalic
citrus
unbeerlike
feel
within
a
fairly
strong
alcoholic
finish
surprising
since
its
a
tap
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
golden
with
an
abundant
frothy
white
head
some
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
recedes
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
aromas
of
pale
malts
spice
fruit
and
faint
yeast
it
smells
grassy
the
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
some
spice
to
help
balance
the
flavor
it
has
a
mild
aftertaste
that
is
spicy
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
it
has
a
crisp
dry
finish
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
solid
unoffensive
belgian
pale
ale
an
ok
blonde
probably
a
bit
old
and
tired
o
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
i
like
it
a
bit
better
than
leffe
blonde
about
equal
distribution
here
in
spain
enjoyable
without
being
overpowering

d
good
beer
i
like
it
overall
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
there
is
nothing
special
it
lacks
a
lot
of
the
complexity
that
makes
for
a
really
great
belgian
pale
o
very
smooth
excellent
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
beer
thats
not
too
hard
to
find
the
flavors
work
nicely
together
to
make
this
an
easy
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
try
to
keep
a
stock
of
on
hand
o
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
this
was
my
first
of
the
style
and
i
thought
it
was
great
o
certainly
not
like
i
remember
it
times
change
and
i
guess
so
does
my
palate
way
too
sweet
and
yeasty
which
is
made
all
the
worse
by
the
thin
body
bummer
dude
bought
in
brussels
in
2011
the
color
is
yellow
very
clear
nice
white
foamy
head
on
top
typical
soapy
looking
foam
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
yeast
not
sure
i
like
it
some
fruits
better
light
aroma
i
bit
disappointing
taste
is
fruity
with
a
very
dry
finish
warm
floral
notes
in
the
taste
too
taste
is
ok
a
good
beer
nothing
to
call
home
for
tho
o
a
decent
blonde
but
in
total
not
much
to
go
for
i
am
missing
floral
hops
and
some
extra
sweetness
its
a
pale
strawcolored
ale
with
a
decent
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
taste
is
nice
what
youd
expect
from
a
nice
belgian
ale
i
cant
help
but
thinking
for
the
price
that
leffe
is
a
better
deal
at
least
for
my
tastes
grimbergen
is
good
but
leffe
in
my
opinion
is
just
a
little
better
and
more
inexpensive
for
this
general
price
range
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bold
gold
color
with
thin
rapidly
fading
head
its
aroma
is
primarily
fruity
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
flavor
it
fruity
with
lemon
and
honey
notes
with
caramel
showing
through
as
it
warms
initially
it
resembles
a
witbier
but
has
a
more
complex
malty
flavor
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
smooth
and
refreshing
grimbergen
blonde
ale
is
a
good
beer
try
it
with
pasta
recommended
overall
this
is
a
great
belgian
pale
ale
that
can
be
opened
for
any
occasion
as
well
as
any
temperature
it
definitely
is
best
enjoyed
chilled
but
as
it
warms
up
its
dry
spiced
characteristics
become
more
wonderful
it
could
serve
as
a
great
introduction
to
belgian
beers
of
this
style
and
anyone
who
enjoys
good
beer
will
most
certainly
enjoy
this
one
o
very
good
eye
appeal
and
remarkable
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
belgians
highly
recommended
anyhow
at
18
a
12
oz
six
pack
i
doubt
if
ill
give
it
another
shot
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
terribly
complex
in
the
taste
although
not
at
all
boring
either
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
tame
taste
but
not
too
bad
overall
i
am
new
to
the
belgian
pale
ales
but
so
far
i
am
enjoying
the
genre
o
a
great
beer
check
it
out
this
is
the
type
of
lighter
beer
people
that
dont
know
about
good
beer
would
love
its
not
too
heavy
but
flavorful
enough
to
make
you
think
man
i
really
am
sophisticated
because
you
are
sophisticated
you
are
overall
this
beer
is
perfect
for
quenching
your
thirst
not
spectacular
but
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
more
commercial
blond
beers
overall
an
enjoyable
but
not
overly
complex
bpa
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
did
i
guess
that
since
i
knew
it
was
owned
by
inbev
it
would
be
a
less
than
quality
product
this
will
be
a
go
to
in
a
situation
where
my
options
are
severely
limited
its
also
something
i
think
ill
have
success
with
when
i
introduce
it
to
non
beer
drinkers
overall
decent
beverage
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
though
try
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
o
d
fine
beer
tasty
nothing
too
exciting
nothing
offensive
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
its
a
bit
sugary
at
the
beginning
and
end
but
also
includes
some
nice
apple
banana
clove
and
pepper
sweetness
is
the
predominant
characteristic
with
just
enough
spice
and
yeast
to
keep
it
from
getting
cloying
that
said
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
and
could
have
contributed
to
taking
this
from
a
soso
beer
to
a
genuinely
good
one
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
interesting
blend
of
flavors
within
this
style
there
can
be
an
overwhelming
bitterness
without
anything
to
calm
or
cut
it
here
we
found
the
esters
to
be
a
nice
vehicle
for
doing
just
that
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
were
a
bit
dull
and
stand
to
be
refined
to
make
some
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
more
bold
and
desirable
250ml
bottle
poured
into
leffe
chalice
half
a
finger
head
golden
colour
clear
yeasty
smell
some
berries
tasted
of
slightly
off
apples
a
lot
like
leffe
blonde
but
a
bit
sweeter
with
a
slightly
wheaty
aftertaste
some
fiz
a
decent
blond
could
drink
a
few
a
blind
tasting
with
leffe
blonde
would
be
interesting
d
another
domestic
belgium
beer
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
offer
traditional
style
even
though
it
was
sweet
the
alcohol
was
kind
of
harsh
and
the
citrus
really
didnt
cover
up
the
yeast
still
not
so
bad
again
not
crazy
about
it
poured
a
pale
blond
with
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
was
light
and
included
some
yeast
malt
etc
maybe
a
little
citrusy
flavor
was
also
light
with
a
taste
of
belgian
yeast
like
stella
but
a
little
more
interesting
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
i
could
have
easily
had
many
of
foam
with
an
attractive
fruity
aroma
the
nose
is
rather
fresh
dominates
supported
by
both
bitter
citrus
and
fruity
fat
in
the
mouth
as
unfortunately
most
pale
ales
industrial
but
with
a
balance
between
fruit
and
the
bitterness
although
relatively
mild
more
or
less
successful
the
finish
gives
it
the
orange
zest
a
beer
of
its
kind
a
good
positioning
in
the
leffe
ab
inbev
but
it
stops
there
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
goes
down
nicely
the
flavour
is
more
involved
than
many
beers
but
not
overwhelming
worth
seeking
out
to
try
very
light
body
weak
flavor
blond
yes
a
bit
yeasty
a
bit
caramel
and
other
a
bits
just
not
good
enough
in
my
book
wont
drink
this
again
unless
its
this
or
a
lager
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
but
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
it
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
i
think
thats
the
biggest
knock
is
it
just
disappears
from
the
palate
d
this
beer
has
a
soapy
hop
flavor
that
grows
and
that
is
about
the
only
flavor
i
didnt
get
any
yeast
character
or
malt
flavor
unfortunately
d
i
had
this
beer
about
4
years
ago
when
i
was
first
getting
into
belgian
beer
i
really
thought
this
beer
was
amazing
at
the
time
i
have
of
course
had
many
different
phenomenal
belgian
ales
since
then
i
had
always
passed
this
up
when
i
saw
it
for
some
reason
i
started
craving
it
again
upon
revisiting
the
beer
i
still
find
it
enjoyable
when
comparing
it
to
some
other
belgian
ales
it
isnt
quite
as
exciting
as
i
used
to
think
it
was
i
still
like
it
however
it
is
a
simple
easy
drinking
belgian
ale
i
will
definitely
continue
to
pick
this
up
from
time
to
time
jd
decently
drinkable
simple
and
easy
for
an
undemanding
palate
drinks
very
easily
would
drink
even
better
with
less
of
an
alcohol
kick
very
impressive
beer
especially
for
the
nose
the
crack
glug
was
nearly
religious
in
terms
of
its
experience
resulting
in
well
over
two
fingers
of
thick
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
i
began
to
regret
not
having
donned
the
robes
of
bro
woody
of
the
order
of
disorder
as
the
singing
of
angels
could
be
heard
around
me
the
head
slowly
fell
like
a
penitent
to
its
knees
leaving
behind
a
beautiful
sticky
lacing
that
begged
to
be
licked
from
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
if
i
were
worthy
the
nose
had
a
bready
semisweet
musty
yeastdriven
quality
that
i
had
to
drag
myself
away
from
after
all
beer
is
meant
to
be
drunk
not
inhaled
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
intense
yeast
mustiness
up
front
like
putting
your
tongue
on
the
guttenberg
bible
followed
by
a
sweet
cotton
candylike
flavor
before
giving
itself
over
to
a
slight
grassiness
the
finish
was
semidry
not
bonedry
but
on
its
approach
with
a
definite
yeastdriven
flavor
it
was
about
as
good
a
beer
as
i
have
ever
had
from
a
can
do
they
allow
coolers
in
church
maybe
at
the
church
brew
works
i
am
not
taking
this
to
the
beach
or
the
mountains
however
this
is
a
beer
in
a
can
to
be
savored
seek
it
out
and
remember
who
turned
you
onto
it
let
us
be
thankful
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
affligem
chalice
wonderful
light
golden
color
with
rich
white
head
smells
o
bananas
and
fresh
bread
taste
is
very
good
taste
the
sweetness
of
bananas
with
some
mellowing
tartness
like
pears
the
belgian
yeast
like
a
crisp
spring
morn
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
some
bubbles
drinkability
is
good
i
could
make
an
evening
of
one
or
two
of
these
time
for
some
fish
and
chips
now
mate
d
could
easily
have
a
couple
not
sure
why
i
havent
come
across
this
until
now
but
definitely
one
to
revisit
a
sharpish
clean
yeast
quality
really
meats
the
nose
with
tropical
fruit
behindbanana
i
believe
i
might
wish
for
a
bit
more
going
on
behind
the
yeast
on
the
palate
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
accompanying
fruit
and
yeast
fills
up
the
mouth
quite
nicely
a
fact
that
is
helped
along
by
the
lively
carbonation
and
crisp
mouthfeel
basic
but
an
an
easy
drinker
d
pretty
smooth
and
clean
relatively
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
though
not
extraordinary
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
taste
buds
if
you
plan
on
having
more
than
one
or
two
then
this
isnt
the
beer
for
you
because
it
coats
the
mouth
rather
thoroughly
light
head
of
goldenbrown
with
malty
sweet
nose
of
fruit
strawberries
and
vanilla
extract
with
a
little
spice
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
sweet
with
a
lemony
citrus
flavor
and
hint
of
clove
really
enjoyable
i
could
have
had
a
2nd
easily
served
in
a
33l
goblet
kind
of
off
tasting
light
honey
brown
ale
tastes
like
its
turned
or
spoiled
light
foam
film
that
disappears
and
leaves
no
head
mild
fruity
candy
malt
taste
but
tastes
a
little
off
wasnt
able
to
finish
the
goblet
and
wouldnt
want
to
try
it
again
maybe
just
had
a
bad
pour
drinkability
a
decent
sweet
blonde
belgian
ale
to
call
it
a
belgian
pale
ale
describes
the
appearance
only
taste
thick
bulbous
mouthfeel
upfront
that
gives
way
surprisingly
dry
throughout
with
occasionally
spicy
sharpness
in
terms
of
flavor
its
a
bit
onenote
earthy
yeasty
the
flavor
does
stick
around
for
awhile
which
is
nice
but
isnt
necessarily
impressive
a
little
sweetness
develops
drawing
out
an
essence
of
apples
and
bananas
drinkability
very
good
at
3
99
a
six
pack
this
stuff
will
keep
you
drinking
it
all
day
d
very
highly
drinkable
belgian
clean
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
drinks
like
a
5
beer
until
the
barely
noticeable
alcohol
kicks
in
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
and
i
could
easily
have
another
pours
a
golden

and

with
sweet
malts
and

but
not
full
flavored
still
a
good
blonde
tasty
and
drinkable
reccomended
o
medium
drinkability
strong
belgium
character
not
bad
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
so
easy
to
consume
that
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
blonde
offers
many
of
the
qualities
of
a
trippel
without
the
higher
alcohol
content
a
bit
lighter
in
flavor
too
its
a
good
start
to
the
evening
i
could
see
having
23
of
these
the
artwork
is
a
bit
gaudy
on
this
11
2
fl
beer
some
sort
of
hereldic
eagle
but
not
too
over
the
top
the
beer
pours
a
thick
head
the
beer
itself
a
clear
straw
yellow
the
predominant
smell
is
yeast
but
with
a
backing
of
fruity
esters
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
clouded
muzzy
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
thick
and
silty
it
has
faint
taste
of
bananas
backed
with
a
carbonated
bite
theres
a
light
citrus
zip
but
the
overwhelming
silt
feeling
still
dominants
its
hard
to
drink
anymore
than
a
little
of
this
at
a
time
before
it
feels
like
your
teeth
are
being
sandblasted
bring
plenty
of
water
taste
lemon
orange
coriander
zippy
feel
to
it
slight
buttery
aspect
mouthfeel
throughout
leaves
no
surprises
extremely
expensive
for
what
it
is
plenty
of
similar
beers
mothership
wit
comes
to
mind
for
a
lot
less
a
worthy
belgian
blonde
that
could
be
much
better
if
not
for
a
couple
flaws
beautiful
golden
yellow
color
with
some
nice
lacing
fruity
spicy
smell
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
apple
spice
and
maybe
a
little
banana
thrown
in
mouthfeelreminds
me
of
a
cider
for
some
reason
surprisingly
theres
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
works
overall
its
about
what
id
expect
from
a
belgian
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
and
the
crispness
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
very
drinkable
nice
amount
of
alcohol
flavor
and
feel
to
it
the
beer
leaves
the
glass
clean
from
beginning
to
end
overall
a
pretty
solid
belgian
blonde
simple
refreshing
yet
it
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
entertained
had
a
few
of
these
cold
with
dinner
at
a
restaurant
last
night
and
while
they
were
enjoyable
i
must
admit
that
i
like
this
beer
better
served
at
55
so
the
flavors
can
really
surface
as
it
warms
faster
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
belgian
blonde
that
i
recommend
as
i
really
liked
it
and
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
i
have
to
agree
with
many
of
the
other
reviewers
that
this
was
a
reasonably
good
moderately
priced
belgian
alternative
for
those
on
a
budget
d
this
is
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
easy
to
drink
great
beer
i
think
i
actually
enjoyed
this
more
than
their
dubbel
although
that
might
just
be
a
stylistic
preference
the
dubbel
is
very
good
as
well
value
not
a
bad
blonde
but
at
10
per
six
pack
at
my
shop
ill
choose
lots
of
other
beers
over
this
one
overall
i
highly
enjoyed
the
flavor
but
i
think
their
double
is
better
i
would
have
this
again
okay
mouthfeel
for
the
style
nothing
remarkable
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
d
this
was
avery
nice
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
try
it
is
a
easy
drinker
with
it
at
times
going
down
way
to
fast
good
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
a
ton
of
hops
but
at
the
same
time
dont
like
a
ton
of
malt
either
taste
is
slightly
sweet
of
honey
citrus
and
pear
offering
a
nice
carbonation
level
helping
to
provide
a
nice
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
enjoyable
yet
not
too
memorable
either
ill
steer
towards
affligem
blonde
every
time
d
this
is
the
first
of
a
six
pack
and
probably
my
last
at
least
for
tonight
the
abv
is
slightly
above
average
so
this
isnt
a
session
type
beer
but
its
a
nice
alternative
for
the
price
in
comparison
to
the
likes
of
any
other
bpa
that
might
be
comparable
or
of
better
quality
id
have
this
one
again
this
was
the
first
beer
that
got
me
into
drinking
belgian
beers
a
good
and
inexpensive
beer
to
start
off
with
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
d
this
isnt
the
best
bpa
ive
had
but
its
a
nice
beer
on
its
own
merits
the
light
body
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
a
nice
pickup
drinkability
just
not
my
favorite
but
not
too
bad
dnice
drinkability
smooth
with
a
full
charcteristicbelgian
flavor
profile
light
malty
sweetness
hint
of
hops
nothing
overly
bitter
decent
carbonation
good
companion
for
food
very
drinkable
nearly
every
café
or
tavern
in
belgium
will
have
this
very
likely
on
tap
even
definitely
worth
trying
the
body
is
light
as
is
the
carbonation
the
combination
makes
the
feel
pretty
slick
its
drinkable
as
a
pub
standard
but
is
not
refreshing
i
wish
this
was
a
tad
weaker
in
the
abv
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
taste
or
experience
of
this
at
all
i
feel
that
this
is
superior
to
the
abbaye
de
leffe
and
suits
this
mild
fall
night
perfectly
since
the
apple
and
pear
flavors
fit
in
nicely
with
the
season
and
theres
no
spice
or
smokiness
here
like
in
so
many
octoberfest
beers
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
of
late
drefreshing
and
easy
to
drink
an
inexpensive
quality
brew
that
most
people
can
enjoy
this
is
one
of
the
first
belgian
style
beers
i
enjoyed
when
i
was
younger
overall
this
is
a
solid
blonde
beer
it
produces
a
wonderful
color
a
very
agreeable
taste
and
a
great
mouthfeel
that
hides
the
6
7
abv
very
well
much
better
than
the
dubbel
in
my
opinion
all
in
all
its
fairly
complex
if
you
give
it
a
chance
yet
its
not
overly
rich
which
leaves
it
remarkably
quaffable
it
offers
everything
its
supposed
to
malt
yeast
and
hops
and
its
quite
nicely
rounded
and
interestingly
balanced
quite
enjoyable
t
very
crisp
wheat
style
beer
has
a
very
alcoholly
after
taste
high
quality
but
very
filling
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
but
not
worth
buying
a
six
pack
tastes
way
too
sweet
for
me
bananas
again
malt
and
as
it
warmed
up
even
some
honey
kind
of
a
metallic
taste
too
but
well
it
did
come
out
of
a
can
and
its
shelflife
was
near
its
end
not
too
lifely
borderline
flat
the
aftertaste
was
gone
rather
fast
and
i
cant
complain
about
that
i
somehow
remembered
this
being
a
lot
better
not
bad
but
nothing
to
recommand
to
some
one
trying
to
get
into
belgians
drinkability
all
the
belgian
yeast
taste
youd
want
out
of
a
tripel
or
belgian
strong
pale
ale
but
with
lower
alcohol
making
this
sessionable
a
bit
low
intensity
and
complexity
but
an
overall
decent
belgian
pale
thats
widely
available
does
taste
a
bit
stale
and
musty
when
served
slightly
warmer
cheers
overall
a
bit
boring
it
is
refreshing
and
lighter
than
i
would
have
thought
but
i
expect
more
from
a
belgian
pale
ale
in
the
taste
department
strictly
average
at
best
imo

very
clear
and

of

some

the
give
off
a

light
orange
tastes
come
out
behind
the
yeast
lighter
banana
tastes
but
more
clove
on
the
dryer
sides
a
nice
beer
overall
but
not
as
clean
as
i
would
have
liked
to
see
carbonation
was
a
little
low
for
a
belgian
pale
and
the
body
was
medium
a
little
body
and
some
light
carbonation
but
just
enough
to
keep
a
skim
of
head
on
the
pint
nice
balance
for
drinkability
this
is
good
summer
beer
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
worth
a
try
nothing
within
it
is
a
standout
but
no
real
off
flavors
very
very
smooth
and
thirst
quenching
this
beer
pouts
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
malt
and
leathery
yeast
the
taste
is
more
yeasty
than
the
aroma
but
the
is
still
a
significant
amount
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fine
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
belgain
pale
ale
that
i
could
drink
again
this
is
a
style
im
creeping
into
and
this
one
was
available
at
a
nice
sixer
price
first
of
all
the
bottle
and
pack
holder
are
nice
to
look
at
so
they
got
my
attention
over
some
other
newcomers
to
my
beer
stop
pours
as
youd
expect
blonde
with
a
nice
head
which
dissipates
at
a
pace
you
can
live
with
the
bottle
tells
me
that
it
is
fruity
and
malty
and
i
agree
as
the
flavors
blend
nicely
yet
there
could
be
just
a
touch
more
fruit
to
increase
gulpability
if
this
were
the
case
however
it
might
leave
bpa
land
and
creap
up
on
a
dubbel
or
something
else
all
in
all
this
is
tasty
and
something
that
i
will
pickup
when
i
can
in
fact
im
going
on
sixer
number
2
this
isnt
bad
its
certainly
a
decent
blonde
but
its
not
delicious
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
but
smooth
and
not
sticky
exactly
what
i
would
expect
oh
and
this
is
about
a
4
taste
no
hint
of
the
6
7
good
job
although
it
looks
great
and
tastes
nice
the
high
abv
for
me
anyway
lowers
the
drinkability
its
one
i
can
drink
on
occasion
but
it
would
never
become
a
staple
beer
of
choice
for
me
personally
when
poured
grimbergen
blond
had
an
impeccable
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
sudsy
white
head
of
foam
tastes
of
bready
malt
pear
like
sweetness
tingly
spices
mineral
water
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
a
nicley
balanced
blonde
ale
that
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
this
ones
very
drinkable
an
excellent
brew
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
looked
great
felt
great
but
just
the
weak
nose
held
it
back
a
little
definitely
a
great
drinkable
belgian
blond
probably
the
best
of
grimbergens
starndard
four
offerings
recommended
the
taste
is
nice
and
similar
it
has
plenty
of
grain
with
bubblegum
raisin
grape
juice
wine
hay
and
breadcrust
again
the
same
witbiermaltliquor
mix
its
similar
to
leffe
blonde
but
a
bit
drier
pours
with
a
yellow
golden
color
and
a
large
frothy
head
that
lasts
well
aroma
smells
clean
but
resembles
more
of
a
pale
lager
not
a
belgian
blond
flavor
is
very
sweet
fruity
malt
liquorlike
watery
texture
its
not
like
its
marten
low
carb
but
this
beer
basically
sucks
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
the
flavors
mixed
well
and
there
was
no
separation
of
flavors
like
i
sensed
with
some
of
the
other
blondes
i
have
sampled
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
head
and
flavor
i
would
definitely
rank
this
near
the
top
of
the
blondes
that
i
have
tried
so
far
but
certainly
not
a
tip
top
blonde
i
dont
find
myself
wanted
to
go
back
to
this
beer
as
much
as
i
do
some
others
a
beautiful
golden
color
makes
the
use
of
blonde
an
understatement
the
nose
is
soft
with
fruit
equal
to
but
not
quite
better
than
other
belgian
ale
taste
is
fruity
stronger
malt
and
light
sourness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
but
in
a
good
way
there
are
better
examples
of
belgian
ale
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer

i
like
the
semi
sweet
profile
and
a
fine
brew
for
sure
overallnotes
the
foaminess
of
this
covers
the
overall
taste
but
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
because
of
how
light
and
smooth
it
is
bb
12

like
the
smell
in

has
some
weird
fruit
flavors
lots
of
honey
too
was
looking
for
a
freshing
light
belgian
but
got
a
sweet

attack
needs
some
more
hops
to
dry
it
out
some
sweet

dry

for

it

no

did
not
linger
long
at

could
not

of
this

this
serving
was
fine
heavy
for
what
it
is

probably
would
not

again
might
be

feel

is

not

some

the

not
dry
or
overly
tart
so
that
is
a
big
plus
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
pretty
enjoyable
very
similar
to
some
other
belgian
pales
yet
this
one
hits
the
mark
not
too
drawn
out
yet
not
too
reserved
recommended
i
do
enjoy
that
this
comes
in
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
bomber
pours
from
an
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
no
1607rl1985a
sampled
on
feb
7
2009
it
pours
a
golden
tone
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
is
about
an
inch
thick
that
dissolves
downward
but
never
fades
entirely
the
aroma
is
a
bit
malty
bready
and
yeasty
and
the
fermentation
was
well
sealed
into
the
bottle
very
good
mouthfeel
the
flavor
has
the
same
yeasty
and
bready
taste
as
the
aroma
beer
is
a
dark
golden
and
light
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
barely
offwhite
head
but
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
sweet
malts
clean
hops
and
even
some
light
fruits
and
honey
tastes
overwhelmingly
of
sweet
and
sour
apples
and
honeyalmost
reminiscent
of
a
cider
a
slightly
bitter
hop
shows
up
in
the
sip
but
only
briefly
wellbalanced
taste
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
and
lack
of
intense
complexity
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
apples
though
i
was
waiting
for
a
different
flavor
to
push
through
but
it
never
really
did
i
would
recommend
this
for
folks
into
ciders
this
is
also
a
good
beer
to
wash
a
burger
down
with
notes
the
palate
is
really
loose
and
watery
making
for
a
seemingly
cheap
mouthfeel
could
see
this
being
better
right
from
the
bottle
might
retain
more
carbonation
and
therefore
mouthfeel
d
oh
yes
i
can
just
see
a
abbey
full
of
monks
enjoying
this
out
of
chalices
and
having
a
great
time
this
is
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
or
two
this
is
a
great
introduction
beer
for
belgian
styles
something
that
isnt
so
powerful
itll
alienate
new
people
to
the
style
minutes
later
its
still
there
bouncing
about
like
a
mouthful
of
jellied
marbles
one
of
the
better
belgians
ive
had
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
brew
although
it
just
lacks
something
which
keeps
it
from
being
among
the
elite
belgian
blondes
biggs
it
smells
flowery
and
yeasty
it
reminds
me
of
a
few
homebrews
i
botched
it
has
that
same
off
smell
of
alcohol
and
is
medicinal
in
taste
it
does
have
a
fruity
aftertaste
and
is
refreshing
it
looks
nice
in
my
free
fat
bastard
wine
glass
i
got
from
a
buddy
skip
this
one
d
nice
beer
with
not
too
high
of
an
alcohol
content
good
drinking
beer
d
very
good
pale
ale
clean
and
crisp
with
much
drinkablity
overall
it
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
6
pack
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
as
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
tremendous
offwhite
head
the
retention
of
the
delicate
cap
was
terrific
and
the
lacing
prodigious
the
aroma
was
yeasty
and
spicy
mustard
seed
in
particular
odd
with
some
background
of
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
not
as
good
as
the
appearance
sadly
it
started
on
a
semisweet
malt
note
which
then
faded
into
a
grainy
wheat
dryness
with
some
hops
behind
that
the
finish
was
long
and
tangy
but
a
little
metallic
all
rather
odd
for
the
style
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
semicreamy
and
the
carbonation
perfect
it
looked
great
felt
great
and
smelled
good
but
the
taste
just
wasnt
what
i
wanted
goes
down
easily
enough
crisp
and
refreshing
seems
to
be
more
like
a
pilsner
than
a
pale
d
filling
due
to
rich
taste
and
carbonation
saturizes
like
a
hefeweizen
which
makes
you
drink
it
slowly
thus
i
would
not
have
more
than
three
in
a
row
otherwise
youre
full
round
and
can
roll
to
bed
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
definately
seems
like
a
good
warm
to
slightly
cool
weather
beer
for
late
springearly
summer
or
early
autumn
pours
clear
golden
with
a
frothy
head
that
falls
quickly
smell
is
pleasantly
strong
lemony
and
spicy
the
flavor
is
less
robust
than
the
aroma
but
still
lemony
and
grainy
with
a
little
spicy
sourness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
thin
and
slightly
carbonated
a
good
drinkable
belgian
ale
not
the
most
complex
stuff
but
good
for
a
restaurant
not
known
for
its
beer
an
enjoyable
gateway
offering
this
beer
pours
great
and
looks
great
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
up
to
the
same
standards
another
beer
that
i
cant
find
in
ilinois
had
to
get
it
at
one
of
my
favorite
beer
spies
pours
a
nice
golden
cider
color
with
a
pure
white
head
smell
is
very
yeasty
as
it
should
be
nothing
beats
a
wonderful
belgian
yeast
smell
taste
is
good
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
doesnt
have
a
wow
factor
but
still
is
a
good
all
around
beer
d
much
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
there
is
a
reason
duvel
is
a
house
hold
name
this
is
a
blond
with
a
small
brownish
hue
beer
it
has
a
discreet
and
well
balanced
aroma
that
is
better
explored
when
served
in
a
tulip
or
oversized
wine
glass
its
taste
is
a
bit
stonger
than
you
would
expect
and
will
leave
a
sourmetalic
aftertaste
it
will
accompany
decently
smoked
fish
or
fruit
but
will
can
also
enjoy
it
alone
although
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
have
a
third
in
one
session
because
the
metalic
aftertaste
becomes
irritating
after
a
while
a
good
beer
nevertheless
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
it
1
95
for
a
bottle
tasty
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
im
glad
that
i
can
get
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
nothing
too
exciting
it
goes
down
very
easy
tastes
more
like
a
session
ale
but
has
that
extra
punch
of
alcohol
that
can
get
you
in
trouble
i
was
pleased
with
this
blonde
but
i
think
i
like
their
dubble
more
d
pretty
good
i
grabbed
this
one
as
an
afterthought
but
it
ended
up
being
an
enjoyable
beer
clear
light
orange
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
did
taper
down
pretty
quickly
some
lacing
sticks
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruits
and
some
yeast
but
faint
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
here
with
some
of
the
lighter
fruits
coming
to
mind
orange
mango
banana
sweet
malts
actually
the
whole
thing
is
a
touch
too
sweet
but
good
compared
to
the
affligem
blonde
this
was
a
little
sweeter
with
a
touch
fuller
mouthfeel
but
still
a
bit
of
a
bland
finish
with
a
very
faint
sour
almost
metallic
aftertaste
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
lightly
hoppy
in
the
nose
and
very
attractive
in
the
glass
with
a
fluffy
thin
head
very
bright
tasting
with
some
straw
and
lemon
maybe
a
little
honey
slightly
bitter
somewhat
malty
as
it
goes
down
nothing
distinctive
but
not
bad
cant
say
that
it
inspires
much
beyond
that
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
twofinger
eggshell
white
head
that
encompasses
huge
bubbles
and
leaves
behind
nice
patchwork
lacing
could
have
used
a
little
more
haziness
nose
is
a
bit
sour
and
bit
like
apples
taste
is
similar
apple
spice
slightly
sour
and
tart
followed
by
some
pale
malt
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
good
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
crisp
just
a
bit
too
much
sourness
for
the
style
maybe
an
old
bottle
but
not
bad
enough
to
drain
pour
drinkability
although
this
isnt
at
the
peak
of
the
belgian
it
drinks
nicely
and
is
more
refreshing
than
many
of
them
d
pretty
easy
drinking
partly
because
its
not
exceptionally
flavorful
price
is
probably
comparable
to
duvel
not
as
good
though
taste
doesnt
let
down
either
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
full
and
hardy
nuts
dates
feels
smooth
and
creamy
totally
satisfied
with
this
beer
a
fine
belgian
blonde
really
easy
going
and
at

abv
quite
sessionable
as
well
i
didnt
get
to
drink
this
for
several
months
after
my
sister
brought
it
back
from
belgium
with
her
last
october
but
it
held
up
remarkably
well
still
strongly
carbonated

very
fresh

belgians

tastes

pearlike
sweetness
tingly

mineral
water
and

a
rather
lightbodied
and
thin
beer
with
just
a
slight
oiliness
that
presents
itself
as
it
warms
spice
and
carbonation
seems
to
lessen
after
a
short
while
very
drinkable
not
a
punch
in
the
face
with
flavor
but
it
is
satisfying
with
its
timid
nature
satan
gold
was
better
but
this
is
certainly
more
available
overall
this
is
like
a
tripel
light
if
there
is
such
a
thing
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
approachable
belgian
ale
great
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
wont
last
long
nothing
spectacular
ultimately
this
beer
lacks
in
complexity
and
the
sweet
tang
becomes
too
cloying
and
gets
tiresome
nice
try
introduce
this
to
a
wine
loveri
did
and
they
were
amazed
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
not
overly
sweet
there
is
a
stern
bitterness
but
very
well
balanced
maybe
a
little
earthy
not
overly
carbonated

not
too
coarse

it
lets
you
know
you
are
drinking
it
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
a
light
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
had
decent
lasting
poweraromas
of
lemon
and
toasted
grain
with
some
yeasty
clove
as
well
flavors
are
pretty
yeasty
up
front
with
some
bubblegum
and
clove
phenolic
flavors
melding
into
some
citric
and
toasted
tones
decent
but
a
little
to
phenolic
and
yeasty
for
me
still
not
all
bad
d
ok
drinkability
a
decent
presentation
overall
but
really
didnt
excite
me
in
the
process
overall
this
is
the
second
grimbergen
product
ive
had
and
im
very
pleased
with
both
i
like
the
dubbel
slightly
more
because
im
partial
to
darker
beers
but
this
blonde
abbey
style
ale
is
definitely
a
winner
great
as
a
nightcap
or
an
afterdinner
conversation
companion
i
bought
a
6pack
of
this
on
sale
for
about
8
usually
its
around
11
50
per
6
pack
so
this
was
a
steal
will
buy
again
overall
quite
smooth
not
my
favrite
style
of
beer
but
this
had
a
light
amber
color
clear
with
a
small
white
fuzzy
cap
and
minimal
lace
i
picked
up
an
herbal
medicinal
hops
and
wheat
bread
aroma
a
bit
sharper
than
i
am
drawn
to
for
most
beers
its
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
grapewheat
hops
flavor
it
has
a
pleasant
background
of
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
its
lightly
carbonated
smooth
and
pretty
easy
drinking
not
bad
and
definitely
worth
trying
mouthfeel
was
light
and
thin
with
decent
carbonation
and
enjoyable
easy
to
consume
i
would
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
11
2oz
brown
bottle
from
tiger
town
in
gardiner
pours
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
translucent
body
with
a
good
half
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
really
fruity
and
pleasant
like
a
fresh
peach
or
apricot
tastes
very
fruity
also
with
apricot
and
apple
playing
huge
roles
with
some
malt
notes
toward
the
finish
just
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
fairly
light
on
the
mouthfeel
but
makes
this
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
really
very
delicious
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
really
hitting
the
spot
tonight
a
good
beer
but
not
outstanding
i
would
have
again
if
available
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
3
bottles
at
the
palm
tavern
on
kinnickinic
in
milwaukee
price
was
right
along
with
1
50
huber
bocks
at
comet
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
bar
bargains
in
milwaukee
poured
this
into
a
tulip
glass
and
received
a
strong
foamy
onefinger
head
that
stayed
with
the
beer
due
to
constant
cabonation
an
apple
cider
colorish
body
although
you
could
throw
in
a
little
copper
to
the
mix
a
good
smell
made
up
of
a
sugary
sweetness
something
along
the
lines
of
caramel
or
maple
syrup
and
a
dash
of
yeast
and
spices
a
weetlike
taste
follows
but
the
body
thin
to
medium
is
a
little
too
syrupy
for
me
i
dont
mind
a
sweet
beer
again
i
would
say
caramel
and
honey
with
a
good
hop
kick
on
the
backbite
but
a
little
stickyslimey
for
my
likeing
the
problem
is
if
you
were
to
eliminate
this
syruppy
runny
feeling
you
either
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
out
of
the
taste
or
jack
the
abv
up
both
of
these
solutions
only
create
another
problem
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
session
this
dnot
bad
i
could
have
a
few
whit
the
limited
choices
here
in
my
buisness
trip
to
paris

2
oz
bottle
pours
clear
gold
with
2
cm
foamy
off
white
head
that
is
slowly
diminishing
aromas
of
orange
spice
and
yeast
are
balanced
initial
flavor
is
mostly
citrus
dry
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
moderately
lasting
good
lacing
light
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
and
light
hints
of
alcohol
drinkable
but
better
available
options
exist
pale
golden
in
color
as
it
sits
in
my
duvel
tulip
a
thin
quickly
moving
stream
of
carbonation
rises
from
the
center
of
the
bottom
towards
the
top
to
support
the
settling
chunky
head
the
head
ends
up
blotchy
and
thin
the
aroma
is
similar
to
baltika
3
with
a
hint
of
belgian
yeast
sweet
sugar
with
white
grape
undertones
give
depth
to
the
pilsnerlike
characteristics
of
the
beer
the
aroma
has
a
good
hint
of
what
the
taste
is
like
it
is
also
sweet
and
grapey
with
a
relatively
smooth
and
thick
body
decent
flavor
profile
but
it
tastes
a
bit
cheap
imo
good
hopping
toward
the
end
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
it
leaves
a
sticky
film
in
my
mouth
from
the
residual
sugars
a
little
more
alcohol
would
cut
down
on
this
a
bit
overall
i
like
this
beer
if
it
is
on
sale
maybe
id
buy
a
4pack
it
could
also
be
used
to
ease
a
friend
into
more
complex
and
wilder
belgian
blondestrong
ales
body
is
full
and
rich
lightly
creamy
without
being
foamy
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
although
it
is
a
bit
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
with
the
body
and
nose
it
has
to
offer
im
slightly
disappointed
in
the
mild
flavor
light
to
medium
in
color
this
beer
is
easy
easy
to
drink
not
to
over
the
top
with
flavor
duvel
still
has
the
angle
in
this
style
in
my
opinion
the
blonde
is
good
but
i
still
prefer
grimbergens
dubbel
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
so
ill
give
it
its
due
pours
just
a
slightly
hazed
gold
with
little
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
nose
is
the
typical
sweetness
with
a
citric
edge
flavor
is
actually
fairly
mild
at
the
start
you
dont
get
anything
immediate
but
after
you
do
get
that
slight
citrus
and
sweet
flavor
overall
though
it
does
not
seem
to
be
very
substantial
the
feel
is
good
nice
bubble
factor
on
the
tongue
drinkable
sure
this
is
a
mild
and
smooth
belgian
that
is
good
but
i
would
prefer
to
move
on
to
something
more
uniquely
interesting
in
order
to
expand
my
horizons
a
definite
hardtofind
in
my
area
out
of
the
many
liquor
stores
in
my

me

a
nice
golden

minimal

very
fruity
with
almost
a
wheaty
essence
some
carbonation

wonderful
taste
exploding
with
creaminess
fruit
flavors
dominate
the
palate
with
a
vanilla
aftertaste
full
of
spices
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
likewise
great
and
even
at
6
7
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
behind
a
flavorful
combination
that
is
amazing
an
awesome
example
of
the
style
which
is
definitely
worth
a
try
a
crisp
and
refreshing

which
deserves

of

d
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
w
great
fruity
spicy
flavors
highly
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
drinkability
could
be
a
dnagerous
session
beer
at
6
7
quenching
and
esy
to
consume
a
nice
starter
for
those
just
getting
inot
the
belgium
styles
the
beer
decamps
the
stubby
bottle
a
slightly
beclouded
coppery
color
with
a
magisterial
bright
white
head
that
settles
slowly
the
lace
forms
a
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
has
an
apple
like
fruit
aroma
malt
and
bit
of
sour
dough
bread
front
has
a
tangy
sweetness
with
the
malt
adequate
hard
apple
cider
comes
to
mind
and
palate
top
is
medium
to
light
in
feel
finish
is
desert
bone
dry
hints
of
hops
and
the
hard
cider
last
to
the
very
end
not
what
i
expected
not
bad
but
not
that
good
either
drinkable
but
a
disappointment
as
i
love
most
all
their
beers
d
its
not
as
bad
as
im
probably
making
it
sound
but
theres
just
not
enough
of
what
i
like
for
me
to
get
past
the
spice
its
ok
but
overall
very
nice
abbey
beer
well
balanced
and
highly
enjoyable
looking
forward
for
another
one
d
excellent
i
will
definitely
buy
again
i
was
awed
by
grimbergen
double
over
a
year
ago
i
saw
the
blonde
and
had
to
buy
it
i
love
it
too
i
will
no
seek
out
more
from
brouwerij
alkenmaes
i
know
the
importers
characterize
this
as
a
starter
belgian
i
think
they
are
right
on
and
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
someone
try
who
is
attempting
to
get
into
better
beers
d
very
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
warm
day
or
with
a
meal
given
the
alc
content
it
really
goes
down
incredibly
soft
and
smooth
drinkability
it
would
be
easy
to
down
several
of
these
in
an
evening
they
arent
filling
and
the
flavor
is
enticing
enough
to
attract
you
to
drink
some
more
d
medium
tasty
for
the
style
but
i
cant
drink
a
lot
of
spicy
blonde
ales
particularly
good
value
for
the
price
at
10
for
a
sixpack
its
a
tremendous
bargain
a
good
couple
bucks
less
than
affligem
for
a
relatively
comparable
experience
pours
with
a
very
pretty
dark
gold
color
with
fairly
little
head
and
strangely
perfect
clarity
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
light
with
some
pale
grain
notes
in
the
background
and
bright
apple
juice
and
yeast
on
the
top
light
uncomplex
but
pleasant
on
the
palate
theres
a
flash
of
fruit
at
first
before
a
yeast
note
rises
to
prominence
things
finish
fresh
with
a
dose
of
acidity
mouthfeel
is
light
even
for
the
style
with
fresh
acidity
and
carbonation
that
fills
the
mouth
but
doesnt
overwhelm
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
little
belgian
blonde
its
a
bit
light
and
insubstantial
compared
to
some
heavies
of
the
genre
but
for
its
price
and
intended
purpose
its
great
taste
is
a
continue
of
the
smell
a
belgian
fruitiness
with
anise
clove
caraway
and
coriander
notes
also
some
fusel
alcohols
and
a
minor
oxidation
the
beer
is
dominated
by
this
spiciness
and
although
there
is
some
malt
presence
this
is
pushed
away
by
the
spices
to
me
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
terrible
leffe
blond
and
to
me
this
tastes
like
an
exact
copy
of
it
aboveaverage
pale
with
lots
of
initial
head
on
cloudy
yellow
some
lace
basic
yeasty
and
wheat
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
drying
aftertaste
yeast
a
tad
of
fruit
in
the
bannana
characteristic
cloves
dominant
spice
also
salt
and
white
pepper
not
very
complex
a
pale
than
a
tripel
this
is
a
nice
beer
which
i
would
recommend
with
light
food
such
as
a
salad
or
sandwich
or
on
its
own
on
a
hot
day
its
was
in
the
upper
80s
in
nyc
today
and
this
definitely
hit
the
spot
the
image
of
michael
jackson
is
giving
me
a
toast
with
a
backdrop
of
gold
with
a
head
that
can
best
be
described
as
icecreamy
smell
is
crisp
belgian
spicey
and
somewhat
reminiscent
of
sour
fruit
its
this
sour
fruit
character
that
overwhelms
the
taste
buds
especially
on
the
aftertaste
sure
as
hell
aint
bad
though
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
pillowy
and
drinkability
remains
significant
poured
this
ale
into
a
chimay
chalice
which
presented
a
12
finger
head
and
had
some
lacing
but
not
like
a
typical
tripel
style
blonde
this
beer
is
also
the
cleanest
ive
seen
out
of
this
style
perfectly
clear
i
do
pick
up
sweet
candy
and
bread
in
this
aroma
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
sweet
fruit
in
the
taste
bananas
with
some
lemon
citrus
it
has
good
mouthfeel
seems
chewy
about
halfway
through
however
this
beer
is
quite
filling
which
will
keep
the
drinkability
lower
than
some
not
complaining
though
but
all
in
all
it
is
a
decent
beer
grimbergen
blonde
is
an
odd
beer
the
label
informs
me
that
the
norbertine
monks
have
been
brewing
it
since
the
middle
ages
and
that
the
recipe
has
been
carefully
guarded
throughout
the
centuries
after
drinking
this
bottle
i
cant
imagine
that
anyone
was
interested
in
stealing
it
as
far
as
belgian
abbey
style
ales
of
the
blond
variety
go
this
is
just
wonderful
stuff
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
chock
full
of
chewy
spices
malts
bananacitrus
flavors
perhaps
a
bit
of
coriander
and
lots
of
candied
sugars
in
the
fermentation
process
i
just
love
this
beer
and
it
is
just
a
great
representation
of
the
style
if
you
are
into
the
style
you
must
stop
in
here
for
a
taste
the
head
retention
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
all
just
great
this
one
wont
disappoint
lchaim
a
lot
of
the
pleasant
flavors
i
usually
associate
with
belgian
ales
but
not
so
heavy
or
filling
a
better
summer
brew
although
still
not
suited
to
be
a
session
beer
pours
with
a
huge
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
lots
of
lacing
it
is
a
light
orange
hue
it
smells
spicy
and
of
sweet
fruits
tastes
of
sweet
fruits
banana
and
finishes
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
very
carbonated
it
is
refreshing
and
the
taste
was
fairly
good
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
looks
nice
and
smells
nice
not
a
bad
start
pick
up
some
slight
fruit
notes
almost
a
slight
bananna
bread
flavor
definitly
a
little
clove
kind
of
a
saisonlike
funk
in
the
aftertaste
really
nice
though
one
of
the
more
sessionable
belgians
ive
tried
not
offensive
in
anyway
i
guess
id
just
prefer
something
a
little
more
kicked
up
but
to
each
his
own
very
good
beer
would
definitly
try
again
perhaps
a
nice
transition
to
the
bigger
pale
belgian
ales
but
the
wow
factor
of
a
duvel
might
be
a
better
tactic
very
nice
appearance
clear
golden
color
nice
columns
of
bubbles
big
white
head
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
little
grass
clove
and
citrus
excellent
aroma
this
is
a
delicious
beer
very
dry
finish
and
very
refreshing
im
really
impressed
especially
given
the
very
reasonable
price
ill
be
buying
this
all
summer
first
grimbergen
beer
and
a
great
start
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
good
thick
head
that
decipated
for
the
most
part
but
did
stick
around
for
the
remainder
of
the
glass
with
slight
traces
of
lace
smell
has
a
sour
hoppy
sense
to
it
unique
to
my
nose
taste
is
great
malty
but
very
well
balanced
with
fruit
tones
to
it
as
well
somewhat
creamy
feel
to
the
beverage
in
part
due
to
the
lower
carbonation
this
beer
hides
the
fact
well
that
its
a
6
7
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
and
recommended
da
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
always
love
the
clean
feel
you
get
from
belgian
ales
especially
if
theres
a
good
complexity
of
flavor
like
this
one
has
not
exactly
a
session
beer
6
7
but
a
six
paxk
is
not
too
much
to
put
down
with
say
one
other
person
who
will
enjoy
this
brew
too
this
one
pours
like
a
macrolager
very
strange
really
minor
head
disappears
quickly
nose
is
better
some
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
wheat
taste
is
excellent
actually
not
particularly
complex
but
full
of
flavor
wheat
cloves
some
apple
and
fruit
too
feel
is
medium
bodied
tasty
good
carbonation
i
dont
know
i
have
a
weak
spot
for
belgian
pales
the
flavor
just
blows
me
away
so
i
have
a
hard
time
being
objective
about
these
very
tasty
one
that
ill
try
again
although
i
honestly
cant
say
if
its
better
or
worse
than
other
belgian
pales
ive
only
tried
the
leffe
blonde
which
i
also
thought
was
excellent
bh
pours
a
golden
yellow
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
huge
white
head
that
takes
a
few
minutes
to
dissapate
the
taste
is
simple
and
classic
nothing
too
fancyand
nothing
too
surprising
the
body
is
light
and
a
little
too
easy
going
it
finishes
refreshing
and
light
with
not
too
much
aftertaste
its
easy
to
put
away
a
sixer
of
these
but
costly
while
its
a
very
good
beer
it
certainly
has
not
bumped
my
favorite
belgians
down
the
list
any
worth
a
try
but
not
really
earth
shattering
nice
in
that
the
abv
is
somewhat
low
when
compared
to
say
a
strong
golden
ale
or
similiar
the
flavor
isnt
quite
how
i
remember
it
tasting
at
the
raleigh
beer
fest
2
weeks
ago
some
lackluster
wheat
pear
and
citrus
round
it
out
the
blonde
is
well
carbonated
and
crisp
with
a
light
body
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
but
thats
not
much
of
a
downside
for
the
style
as
it
helps
the
drinkability
overall
this
thing
is
good
but
just
not
in
the
same
ballpark
as
the
grimbergen
double
one
of
my
favs
enticing
aroma
of
the
belgium
yeast
and
sugar
cane
followed
by
a
sweet
malty
start
finishing
dry
and
acetic
what
a
nice
belgium
session
beer

even
at
6
7
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
50
degree
tumbler
the
beer
was
sour
smelling
with
a
big
pretty
head
and
actually
had
great
lacing
a
slightly
smoky
flavour
made
the
beer
taste
interesting
at
first
but
then
started
tasting
a
little
sour
to
me
and
after
drinking
a
grimbergen
sour
as
heck
double
ale
before
this
one
might
have
been
the
problem
but
i
just
dont
think
i
like
these
beers
will
not
buy
again
not
a
particularly
inspiring
beer
but
its
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
it
lacks
some
of
the
interesting
funkyness
of
similar
beers
but
its
still
solid
and
id
have
it
again
the
affordable
price
sure
doesnt
hurt
either
the
flavor
doesnt
necessarily
blow
me
away
but
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
just
about
does
the
drinkability
is
insane
flavorful
but
not
heavy
with
a
sensible
abv
it
goes
down
in
a
completely
agreeable
way
people
who
got
turned
onto
belgians
via
duvel
and
who
still
love
duvel
are
advised
to
fall
in
love
with
this
one
but
with
all
the
comparisons
to
duvel
dont
get
me
wrong
grimbergen
blonde
is
its
own
beer
less
crisp
and
dry
than
duvel
and
probably
sweeter
and
slightly
funkier
great
stuff
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
lovely
goldenrod
with
a
slight
amber
in
it
lovely
white
head
that
leave
lacing
in
rings
streaks
and
spiderwebbing
the
aroma
is
nicely
sweet
yeasty
and
spicy
in
that
peculiar
belgian
fashion
and
just
a
zip
of
zest
the
taste
is
also
just
fine
sweet
but
turning
dry
almost
tart
or
sour
even
in
a
flash
lots
of
spices
white
pepper
coriander
clove
yeast
bit
of
fruits
citrus
sweet
pretty
nice
the
mouth
had
a
good
body
but
too
distractingly
carbonated
a
little
too
dry
for
me
and
just
doesnt
give
a
good
finish
its
a
bummer
too
cause
ive
always
liked
this
beer
its
just
lost
its
favor
for
me
but
in
all
a
good
beer
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
it
is
really
clean
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
how
it
glides
across
the
palate
and
finishes
really
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
beer
very
regularly
if
it
were
available
in
texas
and
was
affordable
as
it
is
i
will
drink
it
when
i
get
the
chance
poured
an
almost
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
left
some
rocky
lacing
the
smell
is
not
particularly
strong
has
a
bit
of
a
peppery
belgian
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
not
very
bold
but
is
distinctly
belgian
has
the
belgian
yeast
taste
a
bit
peppery
and
sweet
its
on
the
light
side
for
a
belgian
almost
crisp
but
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
very
nice
light
belgian
one
you
can
drink
lots
of
definitely
a
step
above
stella
for
all
those
wanting
to
move
up
in
the
belgian
world
there
was
an
astringent
spicy
flavor
not
uncommon
with
belgian
blondes
cloves
and
coriander
combined
with
a
definitive
banana
flavor
shaped
most
of
this
beers
taste
theres
a
musky
warm
alcohol
finish
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
clean
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
and
this
is
a
drinkable
belgian
not
bad
but
not
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
but
id
certainly
have
it
again
would
make
a
good
session
beer
sampled
off
tap
rather
enjoyed
the
full
pint
a
solid
inch
and
half
of
head
off
white
that
sat
over
a
hazed
golden
body
aroma
yeasty
with
spices
coming
through
quite
present
a
smooth
flowing
mouthfeel
flavours
are
gentle
roll
off
the
tongue
nicely
spices
and
peppery
notes
slight
ester
nothing
much
in
the
means
of
complexion
but
my
impression
was
a
good
one
tasty
easy
to
enjoy
purchased
plaza
liquor
tucson
az
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
a
belgian
pale
a
good
job
here
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
would
be
ideal
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
but
is
every
bit
as
quaffable
on
the
autumnal
equinox
poured
a
lovely
golden
color
with
dominating
white
puffy
head
superior
lacing
from
a
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
tripellike
with
strong
notes
of
bananas
candy
sugan
and
yeast
taste
follows
through
on
the
taste
with
bananas
and
other
fruits
present
finish
is
somewhat
ordinary
with
the
taste
rapidly
disappearing
from
the
mouth
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
spectactular
d
yeah
i
could
drink
this
its
kind
of
straddling
a
line
between
a
blonde
and
a
wit
and
im
not
exactly
sure
how
to
rate
it
its
not
true
to
either
style
obviously
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
tasty
if
i
had
another
one
in
the
house
id
drink
it
but
i
dont
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
beer
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
if
offered
one
again
id
go
for
it
belgians
like
these
tend
to
go
much
better
with
some
cheese
or
some
food
than
all
alone
flavour
of
complex
malts
candy
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
tartness
too
alcohol
evident
lingering
malt
flavours
some
wild
character
again
light
bitterness
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
ale
a
good
summer
party
brew
as
would
probably
be
enjoyed
by
the
masses
kind
of
hohum
its
a
pricey
beer
and
i
expected
more
nice
foamy
white
head
that
disapears
slightly
leaving
little
lacing
strong
maltyhoppy
smell
great
taste
sweet
with
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
wonderfull
mouthfeel
strong
enough
alcohol
to
notice
some
warmth
the
main
downside
is
price
which
isnt
extremely
high
but
like
duvel
makes
it
not
an
every
day
beer
body
is
medium
slick
and
slippery
with
a
fluffy
texture
and
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
to
see
for
10
bucks
and
change
at
my
local
lowes
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
solid
eggwhite
head
rather
frothy
a
little
more
than
a
12
inch
thick
quality
lacing
lasts
the
entire
beer
color
is
a
clear
oranginsh
gold
mild
bubbling
smell
is
slightly
sour
like
some
wheats
can
be
with
some
honeymalt
sweetness
added
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
definate
orange
peel
flavor
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
juicey
with
a
crisp
carbonation
this
was
a
good
deal
ill
definately
be
stocking
up
on
these
while
i
can
this
slightly
hazy
golden
ale
initially
gushes
from
the
bottle
but
calms
down
pretty
quickly
and
is
generally
wellbehaved
as
i
pour
it
into
my
glass
the
carbonation
dissipates
and
the
beer
almost
goes
flat
the
aroma
is
very
herbal
and
accented
by
lemon
this
beer
has
some
very
pleasant
citrus
flavors
and
a
sugary
sweet
character
to
it
that
is
wellbalanced
by
bitter
hops
a
tasty
drinkable
belgian
ale
poured
into
a
trappist
westvletren
glass
pours
with
a
nice
full
and
chunky
head
that
leaves
heaps
of
lacing
smells
sweet
like
candy
and
fruity
and
fresh
the
taste
is
sweet
too
and
if
i
have
any
complaints
its
that
its
a
bit
too
sweet
the
relatively
low
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
is
one
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
very
drinkable
as
it
has
a
relatively
low
alcohol
content
and
with
such
a
clean
finish
it
makes
a
good
beer
to
begin
a
session
last
night
i
had
three
and
by
the
third
i
was
becoming
bored
of
it
so
i
had
one
today
to
review
it
overall
its
pretty
good
but
imo
there
are
better
belgian
ales
out
there
for
about
the
same
price
and
just
as
easily
or
even
moreso
accessible
that
are
just
as
good
if
not
better
nothing
special
enough
to
seek
out
more
than
once
in
a
while
but
nothing
to
turn
down
either
drinkability
pretty
light
only
hindered
by
the
fizz
this
is
a
real
bargain
at
1
99
per
bottle
in
columbus
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
producing
a
one
finger
head
that
produced
great
lacing
throughout
the
duration
of
the
drink
a
fruity
aroma
of
apples
cirtus
and
alcohol
taste
is
delightful
mouthfeel
is
full
of
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
and
crisp
much
like
the
smell
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
wonderful
brew
and
i
will
surely
get
it
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
not
one
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
again
since
it
tastes
more
like
a
wheat
beer
i
would
prefer
a
hoegaarden
or
a
weihenstephaner
hefe
to
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
smells
pretty
much
like
apple
juice
with
a
slight
yeasty
background
smells
good
but
not
very
interesting
taste
is
at
first
nutty
and
fruity
malts
with
a
slight
alcohol
edge
slowly
the
hops
come
through
around
the
middle
with
a
swelling
bitterness
and
spicy
and
grassy
flavor
character
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
lingering
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
lively
bubbles
drinkable
but
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
a
whole
lot
more
of
it
overall
a
nice
drinkable
blonde
ale
i
recommend
this
one
drinkability
quite
a
quaffable
brew
if
it
just
had
a
bit
of
oumph
behind
it
taste
doesnt
last
as
long
as
i
would
like
still
very
good
though
very
interesting
smooth
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
i
was
at
an
irish
pub
in
france
with
an
italian
a
brit
who
only
drank
vodka
a
frenchie
and
two
other
americans
they
spelled
the
pubs
name
obrians
not
obriens
and
it
had
guiness
logos
everywhere
but
no
guiness
a
truely
strange
expericence
but
a
good
beer
an
ok
beer
but
not
remarkable
in
anyway
think
of
this
as
a
duvel
knock
off
that
isnt
nearly
as
good
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
rather
boring
and
unremarkable
for
the
style
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
i
dont
know
that
id
sit
and
drink
it
all
night
overall
this
is
ok
i
am
enjoying
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
have
a
craving
for
it
in
the
future
i
probably
wont
buy
this
ale
but
my
girlfriend
will
and
ill
drink
some
of
hers
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
the
alcohol
was
lower
id
call
this
a
belgian
session
beer
but
i
cant
there
is
too
much
booze
in
it
so
when
do
i
drink
this
beer
again
it
is
not
as
good
as
rare
vos
or
orval
duh
what
is
i
never
heard
of
this
beer
before
i
seen
a
few
bottles
in
lawrence
ks
i
am
happy
i
picked
up
a
sample
but
i
doubt
if
ill
drink
it
again
overall
it
is
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
there
is
a
thin
line
between
good
and
boring
with
this
beer
style
i
need
more
to
be
impressed
i
order
two
83
oz
giraffes
because
im
so
stressed
from
the
antiamericanism
and
dog
crap
i
sit
down
and
set
about
consuming
the
brew
but
its
different
i
taste
apples
nasty
rotten
fermented
apples
that
is
all
that
is
all
that
is
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
terrible
my
friends
and
i
finish
our
nasty
brew
and
leave
all
of
us
come
down
with
a
horrible
case
of
that
stuff
thats
all
over
the
sidewalks
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
anytime
soon
tastes
very
nice
good
sweetness
not
too
strong
very
sugary
a
bit
too
sticky
not
much
spice
but
generous
malt
variety
makes
up
for
that
mouthfeel
is
tough
especially
at
first
big
sharp
bubbles
beer
is
a
bit
too
sticky
here
too
drinkability
is
good
not
overloaded
on
alcohol
and
a
good
but
mild
taste
make
this
one
a
winner
i
had
drank
grimbergen
before
and
wasnt
keen
on
it
figured
id
give
it
another
try
and
glad
i
did
this
blonde
is
exceptional
very
light
and
floral
on
the
nose
no
hint
of
alcohol
and
packs
a
good
punch
in
the
belgian
style
very
yeasty
fruity
taste
on
the
palate
great
mouthfeel
and
extremely
well
balanced
flavor
a
crowd
pleaser
tasted
this
beer
again
in
a
day
and
i
must
say
that
i
do
appreciate
its
taste
a
bit
more
now
i
think
that
ill
probably
buy
it
again
buy
it
wouldnt
be
until
ive
tried
many
other
types
of
beer
first
that
takes
priority
for
me
this
isnt
one
of
those
beers
that
just
gives
me
the
impression
of
wow
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
nice
brew
at
a
nice
price
4
at
sean
bolans
in
baltimore
blondes
the
beer
not
the
girls
have
never
been
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pleasent
and
very
drinkable
candied
sugar
abounds
in
the
aroma
crisp
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
a
nice
dry
finish
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
would
make
a
good
session
beer
except
for
the
abv
which
is
on
the
higher
side
i
put
off
purchasing
this
one
for
quite
some
time
due
to
the
cost
10
a
6pack
thinking
on
it
its
much
cheaper
by
volume
than
other
belgian
ales
but
considering
the
middling
quality
you
also
get
what
you
pay
for
72
ounces
of
this
passable
pale
for
10
vs
8

for
25
ounces
of
far
superior
brew
thats
the
choice
we
have
to
make
sometimes
but
i
believe
when
on
a
budget
ill
choose
this
one
again
overall
i
like
it
good
light
tasty
beer
with
depth
but
it
has
some
issues
with
overdoing
the
lightness
and
introducing
some
substandardweird
flavors
a
pretty
good
beer
but
some
small
flaws
opens
up
bright
straw
in
color
with
a
loosely
knit
and
well
laced
head
smells
honey
and
fruity
sweet
with
some
spice
sourness
and
hop
aromas
tastes
sweet
of
lemons
oranges
pineapples
and
to
a
lesser
extent
mangos
and
apricots
cidery
or
apple
flavors
come
through
with
the
alcohol
body
is
a
bit
flatter
than
i
like
in
a
belgian
pale
alecarbonation
may
be
too
high
spices
and
co2
numbs
the
palate
leaving
a
slightly
grainy
texture
and
flavor
estery
hops
and
alcohol
gives
off
some
clovelike
and
pepperlike
flavors
finishes
a
bit
powdery
or
chalky
but
still
light
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
belgian
pale
ales
out
there
d
a
bit
pricey
better
beers
for
less
money
pours

i

very
nice
nose
consists
of
malts
yeasts
citrus
and
a
good
amount
of
spice
coriander
at
least
taste
is
very
good
what
a
summer
belgian
ale
should
taste
like
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
wheats
along
with
not
too
sour
yeasts
citrus
and
good
spice
flavor
usually
the
spice
isnt
spicy
enough
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
a
solid
beer
drinkability
not
a
bad
offering
and
is
fairly
good
value
in
the
store
was
surprised
to
see
it
on
the
shelf
molloys
offlicence
dublin
but
i
would
prefer
to
pay
more
for
a
better
beer
overall
a
really
good
belgian
pale
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
a
clean
golden
pale
yellow
beer
has
a
big
fluffy
bright
white
head
and
a
good
brussels
lace
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
strong
apple
character
with
hints
of
orange
peel
and
spices
in
the
taste
the
apple
character
melts
to
a
honey
note
on
the
sides
of
your
tongue
towards
the
end
there
is
a
nice
spicey
hop

with

with

very
drinkable
with

a
decent

overall
pretty
good
brew
pours
pale
gold
with
a
thick
and
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
syrupy
the
flavor
is
all
in
the

there
is
honey
and
syrup
a
bouquet
of
flower
hops
towards
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
high
on
the
carbonation
but
not
in
a
bad
way
very
fullbodied
beer
but
in
a
soft
way
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
beer
does
not
pound
the
palate
and
it
is
very
simple
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
nose
is
old
and
muffy
with
lots
of
koreander
and
partly
oxidised

taste
is
not
that
fresh
either
hanging
bitterness
however
not
that
disturbing
cause
low
dosed
fruity

cause
of
coreander
and
maybe
the
ascorbic
acid
unfresh
tasted
it
more
often
but
skip
it
if
its
not
for
a
blind
tasting
not
overly
complex
and
definitely
not
an
ass
kicker
but
still
a
nice
beer
i
think
i
even
like
this
one
better
than
the
dubbel
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
think
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
fairly
pleasant
odor
a
little
yeasty
the
taste
was
fairly
light
lacking
much
complexity
and
didnt
linger
too
long
on
the
palate
other
than
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
the
flavor
quickly
disappeared
not
a
terrible
belgian
but
definitely
not
in
the
upper
tier
and
definitely
not
worth
the
11
99
i
paid
for
the
sixpack
the
smell
was
a
fairly
good
combination
of
light
malts
and
citrus
tones
the
taste
was
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
with
those
same
flavors
present
the
mouthfeel
was
definitely
too
light
this
beer
just
needs
more
substance
feel
is
weakened
and
thinnish
borderline
watery
with
only
a
small
nudge
of
dryness
fruityness
and
carbonation
which
gathers
a
bit
of
strength
as
it
gets
past
mid
way
and
developes
more
but
decreases
again
in
the
finish
this
is
an
appoachable
brew
but
lacks
a
bit
of
ompff
and
character
i
think
ill
skip
it
over
in
future
buying
sprees
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
have
again
poured
out
a
golden
color
with
a
ultra
fluffy
filmy
head
that
just
stuck
to
the
glass
there
was
solid
and
constant
bottom
carbonation
the
aroma
is
very
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
wit
with
heavy
wheat
tones
i
can
pick
up
a
little
clove
as
well
the
taste
is
pretty
solid
with
a
tart
beginning
and
a
crisp
finish
the
semihigh
abv
is
nicely
hidden
but
noticed
when
it
warms
your
stomach
this
is
a
very
nice
anytime
beer
at
a
resonable
price

the
brew
loses
an
impression
of
more
sturdy

about
halfway
through
the
mouth
and
settles
into
an
overly
sourish
quality
with
a
loss
of
texture
at
the
close
somewhat
quaffable
but
it
loses
its
drinkability
at
the
finish
not
settling
great
with
me
at
the
end
akin
to
a
tripelweissbier
cross
too
bad
that

fell
out
i
liked
this
quite
a

50cl

this
beer
has
a
dark
golden
color
to
it
with
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
there
is
a
strong
white
head
there
is
a
somewhat
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
a
bit
of
citrus
also
it
is
a
bit
more
than
medium
bodied
comperable
to
leffe
the
taste
is
enjoyable
fruity
and
sweet
with
grapefruits
getting
more
present
in
the
end
very
citric
zests
of
lemon
wheat
is
fairly
noticeable
too
i
had
problems
to
define
the
aftertaste
thats
kind
of
spicy
pepper
after
reading
other
reviews
i
have
to
agree
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
winy
apple
flavor
that
one
person
mentioned
i
thought
this
took
off
from
the
beers
drinkability
but
the
way
the
hops
appear
in
the
beer
is
still
interesting
the
bitterness
is
enveloped
in
a
fruity
wave
the
mouthfeel
is
very
round
and
smooth
a
good
cheap
beer
here
in
france
i
was
expecting
a
lot
out
of
this
beer
and
it
just
about
lived
up
to
my
expectations
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
too
strong
but
it
has
a
spicy
and
wheaty
feel
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
has
hints
of
pepper
and
a
strong
wheat
character
i
enjoyed
this
beer
somewhat
disappointing
for
the
style
and
for
the
taste
the
taste
in
itself
is
very
soft
and
the
predominance
within
is
of
the
wheat
which
gives
off
a
weisslike
base
for
the
sweeter
brew
which
in
turn
has
no
nasty
aftertaste
or
many
hops
to
it
either
its
nice
though
but
not
top
notch
a
very
solid
abbey
blond
light
in
body
with
traditional
characteristics
and
very
good
drinkability
best
served
at
cellar
temperature
this
brew
appears
filtered
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
bottleconditioned
drinking
it
here
in
the
states
takes
me
back
to
europe
damn
theyve
got
it
good
over
there
as
with
omer
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
my
style
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
hated
this
beer
but
than
i
tried
it
again
and
allowed
myself
to
enjoy
it
slowly
thats
how
i
saw
how
tasty
it
is
its
as
if
in
each
bubble
of
carbonation
there
is
a
spice
hidden
inside
full
of
flower
all
floor
sensational
strength
taste
quality
trappist
sensibilities
why
the
low
marks
people
cmon
this
is
amazing
i
can
taste
a
1000
years
culture
in
every
sip
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
good
somewhat
commercial
form
of
a
typical
belgian
blond
brings
back
good
memories
of
vol
du
nuit
overall
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
prefer
duvels
slightly
sour
maltiness
to
the
sweetness
of
this
one
overall
a
tasty
beer
though
the
blonde
label
seems
misplaced
very
drinkable
but
not
terribly
complex
rather
ordinary
belgiam
good
drinkable
but
nothing
memorable
nice
and
golden
frothy
head
taste
is
slightly
off
smells
not
too
special
nice
carbonation
one
of
the
best
representatives
of
belgian
beers

popular

more
better

medium

wife
works
for
bud
and
brought
this
home
from
work
hate
it
but
im
not
much
of
belgian
guy
anyways
more
of
a
stout
and
sour
type
guy
though
it
looks
great
and
pours
good
it
lacks
a
lot
of
quality
on
tap
had
a
nice
golden
color
to
it
but
the
beer
is
just
way
too
darn
sweet
tastes
too
much
like
candy
banana
very
sweet
smell
as
well
overall
fresh
and
tasty
but
a
little
too
much
for
a
pale
ale
taste
more
like
a
wheat
beer
or
tripel
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
golden
with
nice
head
retention
taste
is
bubblegum
toothpaste
a
little
spicy
like
a
winter
ale
but
that
belgian
yeast
is
overwhelming
in
this
one
tried
a
bottle
of
this
a
year
ago
and
hated
it
but
kept
it
around
to
see
if
age
did
anything
and
this
could
be
my
palate
changing
but
it
isnt
half
bad
nothing
special
here
but
a
decent
clove
with
a
slight
banana
flavored
beer
i
remember
the
aftertaste
being
unpleasant
before
but
now
it
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
an
excellent
lager
great
flavor
not
over
powering
refreshing
such
a
superior
choice
over
run
of
th
mill
domestic
this
is
what
the
big
breweries
need
to
survive
against
the
onslaught
of
craft
breweries
out
there
this
import
competes
nicely
against
local
craft
an
excellent
beer
readily
available
almost
anywhere
in
major
cities
in
the
usa
great
go
to
choice
when
craft
is
just
not
available
had
high
hopes
for
this
belgian
beer
started
out
well
with
nice
foam
and
good
smell
in
the
glass
initial
taste
was
good
as
well
very
similar
to
a
chimay
but
not
as
refined
the
aftertaste
has
something
with
it
though
just
cant
tell
what
it
is
however
certainly
not
as
smooth
on
the
finish
at
the
initial
taste
though
overall
ill
finish
this
6
pack
and
chalk
it
up
to
experience
simply
the
standard
belgian
beer
nice
foam
head
that
stays
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
detect
a
flavor
of
clove
and
a
bitterish
aftertaste
lingers
with
a
semi
sweet
flavor
flavorful
ale
but
smooth
going
down
beautiful
blonde
pour
with
fruits
spices
on
the
nose
strong
fruit
spice
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
hefeweizen
but
with
higher
carbonation
bitterness
not
a
fan
but
my
wife
really
likes
it
have
been
trying
to
get
out
of
my
hoppcentric
ways
seems
to
affect
how
beers
wo
hopps
taste
and
sometimes
im
to
negative
to
them
now
ive
decided
to
just
drink
more
of
the
styles
at
a
time
to
compare
cheers
to
more
tasting
this
beer
has
too
much
residual
sweetness
for
my
taste
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
but
they
dont
meld
well
and
the
unrelenting
sweetness
is
a
distraction
o
not
good
at
all
i
popped
the
cap
and
gave
it
a
good
pour
into
a
chalice

not
a
leffe

with

yeast
and
bread
on

with

bubblegum
and
clove
right
across
the

would
have
to
be
a
small
beer
list
for
this
to
be
my
first
choice
though
doesnt
show
a
great
deal
of
quality
looked
pretty
good
smelled
great
but
taste
was
meh
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
and
didnt
taste
well
with
a
burger
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
a
blonde
and
i
are
a
burger
with
it
and
the
taste
still
lingered
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
a
weak
perfume
not
terrible
not
my
favorite
solid
begin
blonde
it
was
priced
well
starts
off
nice
with
subtle
sweetness
nice
aroma
as
go
on
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
to
much
works
when
drinking
one
or
two
when
paired
with
food
overall
the
overall
experience
feels
too
clean
and
processed
for
a
belgian
blonde
i
would
not
recommend
this
one
ok
beer
kind
of
flat
definitely
not
a
great
not
a
nice
taste
or
feel
i
prefer
beers
which
dont
have
that
strong
malty
taste
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
that
thin
lacing
soft
and
pleasing
aroma
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
goes
down
without
much
of
a
bite
on
your
tongue
how
have
i
not
reviewed
this
beer

ago

belgian

note
secondary
flavors
are
of
grass
ripe
fruit
and
of

clove
but
all
are
subdued
this
belgian
blonde
is
more
drinkable
than
it
is
complex
great
beer
a
little
strong
on

or
whatever
the

is
its
christmas
in
a
bottle
final
thoughts
honestly
this
one
sat
in
my
fridge
for
several
months
before
i
finally
pulled
the
trigger
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
ales
in
general
but
beers
like
leffe
prove
that
it
is
possible
to
appreciate
any
style
the
nuances
in
leffes
flavor
make
all
the
difference
would
i
drink
it
again

so
therell
be
more
for
me
i
had
this
immediately
after
giving
a
poor
review
to
stella
artois
by
comparison
this
one
was
much
better
at
least
it
had
a
sweet
taste
and
aroma
that
was
pleasant
enough
ultimately
however
it
did
not
have
much
bite
to
it
a
pretty
plain
beer
and
nothing
special
i
first
had
this
beer
in
brussels
of
all
places
many
years
ago
and
thought
i
was
being
worldly
sadly
this
was
before
i
got
into
craft
beer
when
i
think
back
on
all
the
amazing
belgian
beers
i
could
have
enjoyed
on
this
trip
i
kick
myself
o
nice
representation
of
the
style
overall
decent
belgian
ale
theres
a
lot
of
great
belgian
beer
available
domestically
these
days
which
makes
leffe
seem
a
little
unremarkable
but
its
a
decent
beer
for
a
fair
price
pretty
solid
taste
of
the
major
belgian
expert
beers
this
one
is
very
approachable
though
the
belgian
candy
sugar
does
give
it
a
sweet
savor
it
tastes
dry
enough
to
be
good
with
all
but
the
spiciest
foods
at
which
point
it
vanishes
into
the
background
i
get
a
little
nuance
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
and
it
pours
with
a
respectable
head
while
not
a
remarkable
beer
by
any
stretch
leffe
is
quite
a
good
beer
its
not
going
to
make
you
forget
duvel
any
time
soon
but
its
certainly
pleasant
and
easygoing
could
also
be
a
good
baseline
starter
example
for
someone
just
starting
to
explore
the
belgian
ale
family
for
just
those
reasons
leffe
blonde
is
a
beer
for
a
widerange
of
palates
and
enjoyably
drinkable
cheers
tastes
a
little
like
a
german
hefeweisen
if
youre
in
an
area
where
the
selection
is
limited
this
is
not
a
bad
bet
quite
good

a

aftertaste
dry
aftertaste
the
body
was
on
the
moderate
side
with
a
seltzer
water
feel
which
made
it
somewhat
boring
but
it
was
okay
for
a
mass
produced
belgium
beer
we
all
know
this
one
this
is
a
good
belgian
blonde
ale
nice
flavor
drinks
well
from
a
glass
and
its
on
sale
at
my
local
supermarket
for
5
99
a
six
pack
what
more
could
you
ask
for
really
mediocre
for
a
beer
that
ought
to
have
been
perfected
by
the
only
country
to
have
been
brewing
it
for
literal
millenia
but
alas
there
are
better
belgian
blondes
out
there
creamy
and
longlasting
foam
protecting
the
trail
of
scents
and
allowing
sipping
liquid
interesting
effect
different
hops
but
the
costbenefit
in
brazil
overall
kind
of
meh
for
a
bpa
overall
the
after
taste
is
very
sweet
and
it
does
tend
to
linger
a
lot
longer
than
you
would
want
it
too
still
the
second
glass
is
a
lot
nicer
than
the
first
which
i
put
down
to
the
strength
numbing
the
taste
buds
so
if
you
plan
on
drinking
this
over
a
day
it
is
not
completely
awful
it
is
well
spiced
and
probably
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
not
to
my
liking
sorry
to
the
people
at
leffe
this
is
a
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
beer
and
as
a
lighter
beer
is
susceptible
to
handling
issues
when
fresh
a
decent
alternative
to
industrial
lager
when
old
which
is
often
it
picks
up
wet
cardboard
flavors
which
dull
the
fruits
overall
this
beer
has
plenty
to
offer
in
the
taste
profile
but
is
overshadowed
by
the
abv
oddly
enough
so
would
i
recommend
it
absolutely
yes
mouthfeel
medium
slightly
syruped
body
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
some
dryness
to
the
mouthfeel
no
flavors
or
even
the
mouthfeel
last
for
that
long
today
i
had
a
glass
of
leffe
with
pasta
with
red
sauce
and
chicken
breast
surprisingly
it
paired
amazingly
well
the
sensation
and
aftertaste
were
absolutely
great
ill
definitely
try
to
repeat
this
combination
after
the
first
taste
of
this
sweet
belgian
blonde
ale
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
my
favorite
beer
but
after
several
sessions
the
sweetness
was
too
much
with
little
complexity
at
least
it
looked
palatable
lovely
adn
everything
it
should
be
served
into
a
medium
glass
from
a
330ml
bottle
there
is
a
lot
of
foam
lacing
stays
for
a
long
time
the
colour
is
amazing
is
darket
than
a
regular
lager
is
thick
thats
present
taste
delicious
very
malty
honey
straight
away
sweet
some
lemon
aftertaste
i
cant
describe
that
amount
of
shapes
and
surfaces
on
a
drink
i
makes
me
i
dont
need
more
maybe
an
hamder
average
but
it
stills
ok
is

wowww
very
drinkable
beer
with
the
propper
belgian
flavour
and
carbonation
never
say
no
to
this
trendy
choice
njoy
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
bubbly
bone
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
aromas
of
bready
sweet
pilsner
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
a
solid
shot
of
pepper
and
yeasty
esters
the
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
with
hints
of
orange
and
sweet
bread
peppery
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
spice
rounds
out
the
flavor
quite
nicely
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
spicy
bubbly
mouthfeel
that
is
a
pretty
nice
belgian
right
there
im
surprised
i
havent
tried
this
before
a
bready
and
slightly
malty
beer
pours
pretty
clear
with
an
average
head
there
is
a
slight
offness
to
the
taste
and
i
cannot
determine
what
it
is
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
but
not
buy
give
it
to
me
and
i
will
drink
it
not
bad
overall
slight
fruit
comes
around
ever
so
slightly
over
the
bready
yeasty
taste
enjoy
decent
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
beer
amongst
those
that
are
easily
found
in
supermarkets
i
really
like
this
beer
its
a
light
golden
belgian
with
a
white
head
that
runs
pretty
quick
the
smell
i
liked
a
lot
with
a
lot
of
wheat
and
sweet
smells
the
taste
was
what
i
liked
the
most
flavors
of
banana
bread
and
a
little
bit
of
mint
from
the
belgian
wheat
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
even
for
a
belgian
white
but
i
still
really
like
this
beer
the
availability
and
price
arnt
too
bad
either
this
beer
is
very
popular
or
marketed
well
in
belgium
it
is
served
in
almost
every
cafeteria
or
restaurant
i
had
these
before
ontap
and
in
my
memorie
they
are
better
that
way
a
more
coherent
and
fresher
flavour
i
dont
like
the
thickness
of
this
brew
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
i
didnt
find
it
quite
as
delicate
or
mysterious
as
the
bottle
would
have
me
believe
regardless
it
looks
great
and
tastes
fine
so
whatever
this
is
a
belgian
light
beer
very
crisp
to
the
taste
strong
smell
of
cloves
very
nice
aftertaste
clear
and
just
bubbly
enough
feels
nice
going
down
a
great
beer
for
conversation
and
slow
burn

overall
this
is
a
belgian
pale
ale
a
collaboration
between
inbev
and
the
abbey
de
notre
dame
de
leffe
if
it
matters
to
you
whenever
you
purchase
this
ale
as
with
all
abbey
ales
some
of
the
money
goes
to
the
monks
who
brew
it
this
isnt
my
favorite
bpa
it
lacks
that
belgian
yeastfunk
flavor
and
its
slightly
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
could
be
due
possibly
to
the
fact
that
its
brewed
with
corn
the
flavor
is
a
lot
less
complex
that
one
would
expect
for
a
belgian
its
a
great
drink
none
the
less
especially
for
its
price
a
bomber
was

i
recommend
it
above
average
but
not
great
leffe
blonde
my
gateway
into
the
wonderful
world
of
golden
belgian
ale
i
have
no
idea
why
this
is
classified
as
a
pale
ale
as
theres
nothing
pale
about
this
fullbodied
beauty
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
into
a
duvel
tulipglass
a
bit
heady
which
dies
down
much
too
quickly
with
light
lacing
smell
is
tart
bright
and
slightly
clovey
like
a
german
weizenbock
mouthfeel
is
mellow
carbonation
and
no
trace
of
alcohol
even
though
its
6
6
alcohol
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
interplay
of
sweet
yeasts
against
tart
hops
leaning
more
sweet
at
first
sip
almost
like
its
a
weissbeer
with
identify
problems
finish
is
smooth
and
you
cant
wait
to
take
another
sip
now
that
leffe
is
distributed
everywhere
these
days
even
my
local
walmart
has
it
its
a
great
value
for
those
seeking
a
nice
slightlycomplex
golden
belgian
on
the
cheap
oa
run
of
the
mill
bpa
nothing
offensive
a
decent
beer
to
give
to
someone
who
doesnt
care
for
beer
overall
not
my
first
choice
at
all
but
credit
were
due
i
personally
dont
care
for
the
overwhelming
clove
flavor
o
keeping
in
mind
this
is
a
bpa
its
quite
good
i
however
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
and
likely
wont
put
any
more
of
my
money
towards
this
one
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
goof
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
was
full
of
flavor
with
the
belgian
yeast
really
dominating
all
aspects
of
this
brew
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
but
the
higher
amount
of
sweetness
and
stickyness
would
prevent
me
from
having
a
bunch
three
in
a
sitting
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
its
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
pretty
good
with
lots
of
nice
head
and
a
pretty
bold
aroma
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
higher
amount
of
sweetness
and
the
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
if
the
sweetness
was
a
toned
down
a
little
it
would
for
sure
improve
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
something
cheap
and
flavorful
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
keeping
it
in
the
fridge
that
often
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
it
may
make
for
a
good
gateway
into
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
for
what
it
was
and
it
was
a
much
better
choice
then
all
the
other
beer
available
at
that
store
this
is
one
solid
belgian
blonde
o
a
great
belgian
beer
sweet
and
just
what
you
look
for
to
compliment
that
yeast
one
of
my
gotos
booooring
this
is
like
a
macro
belgian
that
has
mass
appeal
by
being
very
basic
and
inoffensive
its
yeasty
and
crisp
mild
fruity
notes
etc
i
see
this
beer
featured
in
belgian
beer
classes
at
the
total
wine
over
here
and
i
guess
it
should
be
there
because
it
is
famous
and
a
decent
introductory
belgian
but
for
me
if
im
looking
for
a
belgian
im
looking
for
a
bigger
one
if
im
looking
for
something
lighter
im
going
with
a
lager
or
something
i
can
session
as
such
leffe
doesnt
work
for
me
golden
with
some
white
sheet
and
excellent
clarity
smells
like
standard
belgian
yeast
with
some
metallic
tones
and
a
bit
of
banana
and
petunia
pretty
uneventful
nose
flavor
is
buttery
with
banana
and
some
soil
along
slight
coriander
and
bits
of
belly
button
lint
medium
bodied
with
mild
carb
and
a
slicking
finish
not
impressed
with
this
and
will
likely
not
visit
again
this
beer
is
not
too
bad
its
certainly
not
the
best
belgian
paleblonde
ive
had
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
average
to
above
average
for
the
style
the
head
is
good
the
aroma
is
quite
goodvery
pronounced
bubble
gum
i
like
that
the
initial
taste
is
good
very
good
fruit
flavorreminiscent
of
juicy
fruit
gum
the
aftertaste
is
the
problem
it
is
definitely
a
little
funky
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
it
has
a
great
fruity
start
a
pretty
pleasant
bite
in
the
middle
then
a
funky
aftertaste
that
brings
to
mind
artificial
sweetener
the
aftertaste
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
so
it
makes
you
forget
the
better
aspects
of
the
beer
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
but
it
still
retains
that
peculiar
bitter
and
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
i
will
try
this
beer
a
couple
more
times
perhaps
pairing
it
with
some
cheese
will
help
and
all
told
for
8
49
for
the
sixer
its
a
darn
good
deal
for
an
belgian
thats
authentic
in
taste
and
origin
great
brew
citrus
with
a
nice
sweet
hops
taste
aroma
is
amazing
super
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
great
for
texas
summer
entertaining
if
you
are
after
a
great
and
very
consistent
summer
ale
you
found
it
here
i
travel
a
lot
through
europe
and
this
beer
is
always
consistent
even
back
home
in
texas
a
6
pack
of
bottles
tastes
as
expected
and
i
have
had
several
leffes
in
brussels
something
you
cant
say
about
all
europeans
beers
this
is
a
fantastic
pale
ale
coming
from
a
fan
of
ipas
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
is
not
anything
super
special
and
is
quite
easy
to
find
might
be
a
good
beer
for
people
to
introduce
themselves
to
belgian
beers
easy
enough
to
drink
but
a
little
too
heavy
to
be
sessionable
o
a
nice
beer
enjoyable
and
different
than
mainstream
macros
and
the
usual
craft
beer
selections
however
i
do
truly
hate
that
this
beer
is
now
owned
by
inbev
while
i
like
it
i
think
ill
probably
avoid
it
for
the
most
part
i
give
most
of
the
credit
that
some
belgian
brewery
came
up
with
the
recipe
only
to
later
be
bought
out
by
the
evil
giant
i
purchased
both
the
blond
and
the
brown
at
the
same
time
and
again
was
impressed
with
the
straw
clear
color
and
healthy
white
head
that
left
lacing
all
the
way
up
the
glass
the
citrus
and
carbination
made
this
a
refreshing
beer
i
preferred
it
over
the
brown
which
suprised
me
the
beer
is
one
of
the
cheaper
exports
from
belgium
and
while
not
amazing
is
pretty
good
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
tasty
i
found
myself
taking
big
swigs
and
nearly
chugging
it
because
it
is
so
smooth
i
will
finish
the
whole

notes
poured

moderate

sweet

and

with
a

overall
rather
subdued
a
tame
belgian
pale
ale
i
still
enjoyed
it
and
will
pick
it
up
if
more
assertive
belgians
arent
available
o
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
overall
this
is
a
very
affordable
belgian
beer
with
a
fantastic
flavor
and
feel
a
great
session
belgian
o
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgians
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
peek
im
happy
i
got
this
beer
its
not
exactly
what
i
expected
but
was
easy
to
drink
and
makes
a
good
night
cap
glad
i
have
several
more
to
enjoy
maybe
that
explains
the
lower
scores
here
its
definitely
a
positive
flavor
and
i
feel
i
could
drink
this
pretty
regularly
final
grade
3
41
a
serviceable
b
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
an
exceptional
one
i
am
glad
i
bought
this
as
a
single
because
while
i
could
probably
drink
6
of
these
i
could
also
easily
find
better
beers
to
spend
that
money
on
due
to
the
fact
that
leffe
blonde
is
balanced
not
complex
and
has
an
agreeable
flavour
i
might
actually
recommend
this
to
a
newbie
looking
for
a
relatively
easytofind
bpa
but
i
wouldnt
count
on
this
stuff
impressing
a
lot
of
seasoned
bas
in
short
its
worth
a
try
but
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
ov
not
good
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
too
much
raw
malt
taste
and
no
balance
whatsoever
lots
of
carbonation
but
viscous
at
the
same
time
gross
overall
its
probably
not
the
most
exciting
beer
out
there
nor
is
it
my
favorite
one
but
its
a
beer
i
can
easily
drink
any
day
its
very
easygoing
with
a
full
sweet
and
maltiness
flavor
with
a
light
bitter
to
give
it
some
more
depth
and
balance
its
the
sweetness
thats
leading
though
the
biggest
problem
might
be
its
too
full
tasting
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
and
lacks
depth
to
make
it
a
really
interesting
one
but
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
nonetheless
been
a
while
since
i
tried
this
but
i
thought
why
not
give
it
a
shot
and
pours
a
clear
golden
sunset
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
three
finger
head
and
lacing
all
over
the
placethe
smell
is
spicy
clovesbready
yeasta
touch
of
bananna
and
fresh
peachesthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
lighter
than
i
expected
but
easy
enough
to
knock
back
and
has
tastes
of
bready
belgian
yeastclovesherbal
eartrhy
hops
and
finished
with
that
bready
belgian
yeast
that
dominates
and
overall
the
vieux
temps
yeast
used
definately
dominates
and
its
abit
sweet
for
me
but
an
easy
enough
session
brew
doa
overall
i
like
it
a
lot
it
might
not
be
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
but
i
feel
it
often
gets
a
bad
rap
o
good
beer
easy
drinker
despite
6

its
like
a
solid
cross
between
a
sessionable

and
a
belgian

it

cheap

this
beer
does
lack
the
balance
of
softness
and
firmness
that
is
the
beauty
of
belgian
beers
its
too
spritzy
at
first
which
eventually
calms
down
it
is
lightly
crisp
and
after
time
gets
smooth
so
that
while
for
some
beers
this
could
be
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
its
nothing
special
here
overall
the
beer
is
not
really
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
offputting
it
was
like
a
czech
pilsner
but
was
practically
sickly
sweet
would
love
to
try
other
belgian
pale
ales
but
will
stay
away
from
the
leffe
blonde
pretty
good
brew
some
familiar
belgian
complexities
but
not
as
good
as
other
examples
still
tasty
and
drinkable
o
this
is
an
excellent
introduction
to
bpas
for
those
who
have
yet
to
explore
the
realm
there
is
much
that
one
could
improve
with
this
beer
but
i
may
find
myself
purchasing
a
few
more
given
the
proper
time
and
place
like
others
have
said
its
a
good
way
to
introduce
people
to
the
world
of
belgian
beer
but
compared
against
the
rest
of
the
plethora
of
belgian
beers
it
falls
flat
this
beer
looks
great
after
the
pour
with
a
golden
light
orangeyellow
color
beneath
a
massive
fluffy
meringuelike
eggshellcolored
head
the
aroma
is
light
but
pleasant
with
a
musty
yeast
character
at
first
that
gives
way
to
a
combination
of
light
biscuity
malts
and
some
bright
grassyfloral
characteristics
the
flavor
is
similarly
a
combination
of
biscuits
grass
and
dried
herbs
the
medium
body
and
light
fine
carbonation
let
this
one
linger
in
the
aftertaste
longer
than
id
prefer
though
overall
this
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
yet
has
some
substance
could
have
used
more
zest
flavor
or
smell
its
pretty
mellow
not
much
exciting
about
this
beer
but
its
not
a
bad
one
to
try
decent
and
a
standard
to
be
met
the
finish
is
rather
slick
on
the
palate
yet
clean
if
you
are
familiar
with
belgium
ales
they
tend
to
be
unfiltered
and
more
pungent
in
the
fruit
aromas
either
way
this
ale
went
down
easy
but
i
have
had
much
better
overall
this
beer
was
semi
sessonable
and
cheap
for
its
style
there
were
some
off
flavors
that
detracted
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
and
that
prevented
it
from
obtaining
a
higher
score
flavor
is
sweet
at
first
but
smooth
and
followed
by
a
peppery
almost
fruity
finish
this
is
a
subtle
and
tasty
brew
and
a
solid
middlelevel
introduction
to
the
wonders
of
belgianstyle
ales
well
theres
really
nothing
interesting
to
say
about
leffe
its
definitely
better
than
most
of
the
crap
thats
out
there
but
compared
to
other
belgians
its
not
that
great
its
a
more
watered
down
americanized
version
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
which
is
not
at
all
characteristic
of
this
type
of
beer
i
smell
lots
of
yeast
some
malt
not
too
bad
i
guess
the
taste
is
watery
thumbs
down
there
overall
i
can
say
i
will
buy
this
again
but
only
because
there
wont
be
anything
else
to
choose
from
a
okay
take
on
the
style
always
liked
the
darker
leffe
better
o
overall
not
bad
though
for
a
belgian
ale
this
is
not
one
of
the
top
tier
from
that
country
id
drunk
it
again
if
at
another
restaurant
abroad
that
has
a
meager
choice
but
wouldnt
recommend
to
be
sought
out
onothing
special
here
too
sweet
and
overall
not
a
stellar
example
of
this
style
started
off
decently
but
the
sweetness
grows
a
ton
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
because
the
fruit
and
yeast
flavors
are
decent
but
dont
get
past
the
cloying
sweets
smells
and
tastes
of
banana
bread
with
a
lighter
flourish
of
belgian
fruity
esters
and
a
garnish
of
earthy
spice
noble
hops
blending
together
quite
nicely
actually
the
flavor
is
slightly
weaker
than
i
would
have
expected
from
the
intensity
of
the
nose
body
is
somewhat
thicker
than
expected
as
well
a
full
round
medium
body
with
just
not
quite
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
body
from
feeling
heavy
and
tired
in
the
mouth
a
few
minor
tweaks
to
body
and
flavor
and
this
beer
could
become
absolutely
stellar
o
very
drinkable
beer
while
lacking
in
tasty
deliciousness
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
alone
far
make
up
for
this
its
not
that
it
tastes
bad
just
not
as
superb
as
other
belgians
i
will
buy
more
o
priced
at
2
50
for
a
750ml
from
the
local
albertsons
i
bought
2
bottles
and
enjoyed
them
while
working
in
the
yard
a
solid
all
around
beer
and
one
that
i
sue
as
a
suggestion
for
those
lookng
to
graduate
into
a
belgian
style
beer
a
good
choice
for
those
looking
to
moe
from
a
good
lager
or
blonde
ale
into
a
belgian
style
serving
type
bottle
o
at
a
high
abv
for
me
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
quaff
i
enjoy
the
flavor
because
it
has
complexity
yet
is
not
overpowering
could
easy
drink
a
few
of
these
its
not
an
amazing
beer
its
a
more
sessionable
good
beer
o
ok
will
try
again
when
its
fresher
and
colder
d
a
nice
belgian
ale
thats
simple
and
easy
to
drink
i
remember
having
a
bottle
of
this
back
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
beer
a
number
of
years
ago
and
being
rather
put
off
by
it
im
happy
to
say
this
was
a
much
more
enjoyable
experience
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
the
flavors
are
not
prominent
enough
and
the
alcohol
is
way
too
noticeable
o
easy
drinker
with
good
flavor
really
enjoyable
drinking
it
in
lebanon
and
was
poured
into
a
typical
beer
mug
great
light
golden
colour
creamy
white
head
that
did
not
last
very
long
hints
of
fruity
goodness
in
the
aroma
nice
light
feel
on
the
mouth
not
over
carbonated
and
sweet
taste
no
overly
bitter
after
taste
an
okay
belgian
pale
ale
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
othis
is
nice
drinker
with
some
nice
flavors
to
it
bought
a
single
and
am
glad
i
did
not
sure
ill
ever
buy
it
again
though
with
so
many
other
options
of
belgians
out
there
i
bought
this
beer
because
i
was
attracted
to
the
looks
of
it
the
head
on
this
beer
was
a
light
color
that
wasnt
very
thick
the
smell
on
the
other
hand
was
fruity
and
rich
with
a
sweet
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
fulfilling
with
a
kind
of
fizzy
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
originally
thought
it
was
but
it
is
still
a
wildly
divergent
and
almost
massmarket
version
of
a
cool
very
belgian
style
not
recommended
o
pretty
nice
beer
a
fair
bit
on
the
smell
that
you
get
when
you
taste
it
but
on
the
taste
it
comes
through
a
bit
weaker
had
tons
of
these
on
tap
in
brugge
as
its
served
there
like
budweiser
is
here
in
the
states
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
it
drinking
glass
after
glass
throughout
the
afternoons
moving
on
to
bigger
beers
in
the
evening
but
man
this
stuff
does
not
translate
the
same
in
the
bottle
too
sweet
and
spice
ridden
and
it
only
seemed
to
get
worse
as
it
warmed
up
i
think
ill
wait
till
the
next
time
im
in
belgium
to
revisit
this
one
gold
and
very
yellow
in
apprearance
smell
is
quit
typical
of
you
ero
brews
mouthfeel
is
very
champaigeny
with
lots
of
bubbles
the
taste
is
very
typical
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
one
that
is
average
very
wheat
and
yeast
heavy
in
taste
overall
this
a
good
belgian
if
that
is
your
type
of
beer
although
we
have
had
better
o
below
average
thebeeralmanac
com
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
belgian
yeast
grain
spices
and
some
banana
taste
is
of
grain
and
banana
up
front
with
spice
and
yeast
flavors
coming
through
more
on
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
light
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
light
flavor
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
full
flavored
bpa
for
sure
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
well
rounded
i
really
like
this
recommended
poured
from
a
bottle
300
ml
gives
a
deep
yelloy
colour
with
a
twofinger
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
quite
pleasantsomething
between
bananas
and
bubblegum
as
carbonated
as
it
is
needed
taste
is
fruity
also
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
leaves
you
with
a
bitterness
overall
a
quite
nice
beer
moreover
i
dont
how
todd
from
ba
can
justify
giving
this
beer
a

yes
there
are
better
belgian
blondes
in
the
world
but
for
a
large
scale
product
leffe
blonde
is
great
orange
amber
in
color
with
medium
thick
white
head
with
decent
retention
it
gradually
recedes
then
left
plenty
of

the
smell

sweetness

appear
in
the
flavor
with
alcohol
fusel
touch

and
some
kick
of

bitterness
to
balance
the
body
is
medium
with
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
on
tap
is
still
good
and
enjoyable
with
more
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
portion
than
in
bottle
a
little
thick
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
looks
can
be
decieving
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
especially
on
sale
for
1
euro
but
it
has
an
eventual
blandness
to
it
that
i
dont
get
from
other
belgians
of
the
style
o
i
thought
it
was
ok
smell
was
better
than
the
taste
taste
was
only
as
good
as
the
head
the
rest
of
the
beer
had
too
much
sweetness
for
me
i
think
this
beer
would
do
well
to
reduce
the
beta
rest
temperature
or
if
they
use
decoction
maybe
pull
a
thinner
portion
of
the
mash
just
a
thought
wouldnt
be
likely
to
buy
from
store
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
resembles
a
marshmallow
excellent
lacing
and
retention
but
i
typically
prefer
a
more
translucent
bottle
conditioned
appearance
unmistakable
traditional
belgian
smell
i
could
make
out
a
bready
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
clove
and
spice
this
ale
has
a
well
balanced
complex
taste
full
of
citrus
spice
and
sweet
malt
with
very
low
bitterness
present
i
really
enjoyed
the
soft
sweetness
and
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
filling
with
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
spicy
and
sweet
i
could
see
how
some
might
find
it
too
sweet
but
i
really
liked
the
variation
on
the
style
one
finger
white
head
over
deep
gold
body
quick
dissipation
with
acceptable
lacing
multiple
rising
streams
of
carbonation
nice
nose
coriander
and
orange
peel
taste
mirrors
nose
medium
sweetness
balanced
by
good
dose
of
coriander
medium
mouthfeel
good
effervescence
enjoyable
just
not
that
memorable
overall
a
wellbalanced
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
o
i
guess
my
palate
is
not
refined
enough
to
bash
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
tasty
and
delicious
there
are
belgian
beers
i
favor
over
this
one
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
some
reviews
make
this
beer
out
to
be
as
bad
as
the
mass
produced
crap
found
in
the
us
or
australia
but
i
think
they
are
dead
wrong
it
may
not
be
a
trappist
beer
but
its
not
too
bad
on
the
palate
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
banana
spices
and
grains
on
the
nose
here
there
might
even
be
some
citrus
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
off
in
my
opinion
whatever
it
was
it
just
wasnt
working
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
was
lightly
carbonated
light
bodied
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
the
flavors
just
werent
all
that
good
to
me
d
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
drinking
brew
good
flavor
but
by
no
means
overly
impressive
in
any
one
area
o
this
is
a
good
entrylevel
beer
for
new
drinkers
of
craft
beer
overall
a
very
pleasant
brew
that
makes
you
want
another
o
a
wellbalanced
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
a
little
bit
of
belgian
spice
not
too
much
some
malty
sweetness
but
again
not
a
lot
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
beer
its
not
offensive
but
also
not
spectacular
theres
not
really
a
lot
going
on
im
not
an
expert
on
belgians
but
this
is
certainly
near
the
bottom
of
the
list
from
the
ones
ive
had
though
its
not
bad
either
its
better
than
stella
thats
for
sure
i
enjoyed
this
at
first
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
i
like
it
the
sweetness
builds
on
the
palate
and
the
yeast
gets
to
be
old
if
its
this
or
a
beer
that
ends
in
lite

but
i
have
to

it
is
definitely
european

i
would
agree
with
the
labels
claim
of
it
being
subtle
its
smooth
but
certainly
electrifies
your
tastes
buds
with
the
yeast
and
sweetness
its
still
pretty
light
and
refreshing
though
lightly
sweet
taste
is
more
subtle
than
the
nose
and
a
great
looking
beer
to
stare
at
while
savoring
a
solid
good
beer
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
having

might
be
heading
to
the
store
for
so
e
seasonal
american
ales
overall
i
give
this
beer
an
average
rating
i
like
belgium
style
beers
but
not
with
this
much
clove
taste
d
i
guess
its
an
acceptable
beer
but
i
wont
bother
with
it
again
dvery
drinkable
beer
light
but
rich
in
flavor
bright
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
thick
rocky
white
cap
after
the
pour
that
sustains
for
quite
a
while
yeasty
sweet
malty
aromas
along
with
strong
hints
of
clove
and
light
hints
of
banana
medium
body
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
classic
yeasty
sugary
sweet
and
malty
belgian
flavors
with
clove
and
spice
very
tasty
but
somewhat
forgettable
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
try
another
bpa
if
it
were
available
over
this
one
in
short
liquefied
sweet
corn
with
clove
staring
in
the
face
overall
not
a
very
good
taste
avoid
if
possible
mouthfeel
is
creamy
slick
and
smooth
with
light
carbonation
a
light
to
medium
body
and
a
refreshing
feel
to
the
whole
experience
this
may
not
be
the
most
complicated
belgian
blond
but
it
hides
the
abv
well
and
is
always
enjoyable
to
me
a
great
session
beer
that
i
recommend
trying
my
brother
brought
home
a
sixer
o
this
im
becoming
proud
of
his
recent
purchases
and
allowed
me
to
join
him
in
partaking
of
the
belgianness
it
pours
a
bright
golden
straw
topped
by
a
thick
coif
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
clove
wheat
banana
pepper
and
a
touch
of
cardamom
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
only
with
a
touch
of
orange
peel
and
a
bit
more
wheat
along
with
some
belgian
yeast
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
blonde
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
nice
rich
appearance
and
great
balanced
nose
flavor
is
not
complex
but
does
have
a
nice
fully
bittersweet
malt
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
jd
cheers
not
a
very
complex
brew
but
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
a
nice
session
beer
for
bspa
fans
the
beer
had
a
nice
colour
and
a
slight
head
the
smell
was
strong
and
malty
almost
smokey
in
nature
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
and
if
youre
in
to
that
then
youll
probably
like
this
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
drinkability
is
so
good
except
the
price
thats
pretty
much
it
d
its
not
a
hard
ale
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
leave
the
best
impression
on
the
palate
a
good
beer
i
will
buy
againbut
perhaps
lacks
the
world
class
spunk
of
a
belgian
ale
belgian
ales
are
my
favorite
types
of
beersthis
one
is
good
but
there
are
more
magical
ones
out
there
overall
this
beer
gets
knocked
around
by
critics
quite
a
bit
but
i
personally
found
it
more
than
adequate
perhaps
its
too
commercial
for
many
i
would
like
to
refer
to
this
one
as
a
craft
beer
geeks
lawnmower
beer
d
crisp
and
refreshing
a
classic
blonde
would
enjoy
any
time
cheers
it
wobbles
my
mind
a
bit
that
this
is
what
some
people
think
of
as
just
a
beer
at
least
i
would
like
to
think
that
this
is
the
case
i
know
that
stella
artois
is
the
bud
of
belgium
but
i
can
trick
myself
into
thinking
that
there
is
a
land
where
this
is
as
basic
and
accessible
as
it
gets
a
man
can
dream
yes
kojkiojkiojk
drinkabilityi
so
so
since
there
are
so
many
better
belgian
pale
out
there
all
in
all
a
quality
ale
billed
as
a
blonde
nothing
too
extraordinary
but
still
one
of
inbevs
better
offerings
drinkability
pretty
light
and
refreshing
for
a
decent
belgian
beer
some
of
the
flavor
is
not
my
favorite
but
overall
it
is
quite
a
pleasurable
experience
t
in
a
very
light
flavor
slightly
crisping
on
the
tongue
with
slight
bitterness
final
discreet
but
is
seen
chewing
a
bit
of
waste
very
refreshing
despite
the
amount
of
alcohol
d
i
almost
scored
this
higher
overall
but
i
needed
something
to
dry
this
out
a
little
solid
overall
though
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
belgian
macro
or
widely
available
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
beats
our
macros
all
day
long
nonetheless
a
pretty
good
beer
very
sweet
and
extremely
drinkable
very
light
for
a
belgian
beer
it
has
to
be
served
pretty
cold
the
taste
disintegrates
a
bit
when
the
beer
gets
warmer
which
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
in
my
book
d
certainly
not
world
class
but
this
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
accessible
belgian
pale
ale
a
nice
crowdpleaser
just
a
bit
lacking
in
excitement
id
be
interested
in
trying
an
unfiltered
version
worth
a
try
if
curious
but
i
wouldnt
rush
out
for
another
six
d
easy
enough
to
imbibe
but
again
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
not
a
bad
brew
the
candylike
flavors
make
it
a
nice
treat
its
just
not
the
type
of
beer
id
commonly
seek
out
tapped
into
its
own
glass
one
and
a
half
finger
off
white
head
lots
of
fine
lacing
nice
clear
light
reddish
amber
spicy
malty
smells
nice
round
flavour
malty
taste
up
front
medium
body
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
could
have
had
several
poured
into
a
chalice
like
they
suggested
clear
golden
with
a
tone
of
orange
slightly
offwhite
head
is
superfine
smell
is
biscuity
at
first
with
a
whole
bunch
of
yeast
and
herb
notes
tastes
spicy
and
continues
into
an
almost
cough
medicinelike
bitterness
finishes
sticky
and
hot
not
very
impressive
this
is
an
odd
beer
unlike
anything
ive
tried
but
im
not
a
fan
d
like
a
summer
beer
dank
this
while
grilling
and
had
one
alone
i
dont
consider
it
a
beer
to
taste
its
more
of
a
beer
to
drink
i
would
choose
this
over
many
other
beers
if
i
were
at
a
macro
bbq
pours
a
golden
beer
with
no
head
and
lacing
wtf
i
expect
more
from
even
an
mgd
the
smell
though
is
enjoyable
a
sweet
malt
and
lightly
funky
belgian
smell
including
the
normal
clove
the
body
comes
through
with
more
of
the
same
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
could
have
been
more
carbonated
d
i
could
polish
off
a
sixer
and
still
feel
like
drinking
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
buy
again
not
my
favorite
but
an
interesting
take
on
belgian
blonde
goes
down
smooth
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
fairly
well
balanced
the
pour
is
on
the
side
golden
yellow
and
clear
with
a
weak
head
for
the
style
nose
is
of
belgian
sugar
cane
palate
is
that
mostly
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
straw
its
consistently
the
same
flavor
aways
the
yeast
has
a
clear
quality
but
but
of
a
high
market
in
the
world
of
blonds
its
seems
like
its
a
typical
beer
to
appease
it
seems
to
be
geared
more
for
first
time
appeal
instead
of
solid
recipe
in
a
market
of
great
beer
i
like
this
style
a
lot
i
dont
like
this
beer
though
its
too
close
to
the
over
sweeten
european
strong
lagers
with
a
good
yeast
gone
to
waste
mouthfeel
has
a
crisp
zing
from
the
carbonation
and
alcohol
drinkability
is
fine
maybe
a
bit
much
on
the
alcohol
hit
and
lingering
aftertaste
to
enjoy
much
more
d
very
drinkable
the
first
blonde
ive
ever
really
liked
and
am
glad
i
bought
a
bottle
to
try
ill
be
back
for
more
of
this
one
the
reason
i
am
so
shocked
is
that
i
used
to
love
drinking
this
beer
until
it
became
too
pricey
for
me
about
three
years
ago
i
came
back
to
try
this
beer
and
was
shocked
at
how
bad
it
was
i
am
sure
this
review
will
change
as
i
am
really
sure
that
this
bottle
was
just
from
a
bad
batch
d
makes
a
good
session
beer
and
recommended
d
i
can
drink
one
of
these
and
time
to
move
on
to
something
else
i
get
the
feeling
of
a
sugar
rush
if
i
had
one
too
many
of
these
not
my
favorite
style
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
great
not
as
savory
and
delicate
as
others
ive
had
from
the
style
more
of
an
everyday
belgian
pale
imo
then
when
id
get
excited
about
good
beer
i
wonder
if
a
pint
in
the
states
will
be
as
charming
this
is
an
easy
drinking
blonde
it
is
mostly
a
bready
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
but
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
carbonation
and
is
pretty
well
balanced
the
hop
bittering
is
light
and
slightly
unpleasant
but
is
masked
by
the
yeast
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
day
good
refreshing
brew
supremely
drinkable
the
flavours
aromas
are
there
but
theyre
a
little
bit
hidden
and
difficult
to
access
but
overall
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
although
not
as
good
as
its
brown
counterpart
this
beer
is
still
well
above
the
commercial
beer
average
if
you
think
that
in
belgium
it
is
marketed
as
mass
beer
you
get
jelous
of
these
lucky
bastards
ok
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
you
would
store
for
special
days
but
i
would
choose
it
above
any
other
mainstream
beer
this
is
an
abbey
beer
of
the
highest
order
supremely
drinkable
the
flavours
aromas
are
there
but
theyre
a
little
bit
hidden
and
difficult
to
access
if
they
were
a
bit
more
prominent
this
could
be
a
truly
great
beer
but
overall
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
leffe
is
a
good
entry
brew
into
belgian
pale
ales
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
overall
a
simple
pleasing
beer
d
i
havent
had
many
abbeys
the
fact
that
it
is
commercialized
should
make
it
worse
but
its
ok
in
my
book
pretty
drinkable
brew
the
beer
had
a
lighter
feel
than
most
of
the
style
but
the
beer
was
very
bordering
on
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
beer
was
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
but
less
carbonation
than
expected
d
no
off
flavors
the
ale
just
isnt
terribly
exciting
the
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
with
this
soft
taste
and
is
very
drinkable
because
the
beer
is
so
available
in
holland
it
has
so
many
fans
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
but
far
from
my
favourite
this
one
seems
well
suited
as
an
intro
into
belgians
id
pick
up
leffes
brune
before
this
but
still
worth
a
try
i
will
reiterate
and
i
know
its
like
beating
a
dead
horse
leffe
falls
apart
as
soon
as
it
warms
the
flavors
become
insipid
and
even
downright
disgusting
and
the
thick
buttery
mouthfeel
noticeably
changes
into
something
syrupy
and
unpleasant
surprisingly
for
something
put
out
by
inbev
this
is
remarkably
decent
unfortunately
economics
of
scale
dictate
that
it
must
be
filtered
and
therein
is
the
greatest
folly
while
the
pseudoparchment
label
hints
at
an
abbey
ale
and
has
thinly
veiled
affectations
of
a
true
belgian
beer
its
mass
produced
qualities
too
easily
shine
through
some
consumers
will
undoubtedly
pick
this
up
because
it
looks
like
it
could
be
a
true
belgian
pale
ale
and
indeed
it
has
a
few
admirable
qualities
but
i
cant
really
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
has
tasted

authentic

was
happy
to
see
the
pub
across
the
way
with
a
whole
belgian
draught
line
and
remembered
that
i
hadnt
had
a
leffe
in
quite
a
while
so
the
golden
blonde
poured
nicely
by
a
pro
and
its
aroma
had
a
sharp
fruit
quality
to
it
and
a
nice
clear
golden
hue
with
dense
head
the
flavor
was
both
creamy
pure
golden
body
with
a
sizable
head
this
beer
smells
like
yeast
more
than
anything
else
but
nothing
like
many
small
brewery
belgians
its
nice
you
can
find
it
most
places
and
a
great
alternative
for
any
occasion

but
keeps
you
going
and
wanting
more

maybe
just
a
little
too
much
of
the
cloves
got
very
sick
of
it
mainly
lemon
and

after
a
couple
of
boots
of
this
last
year
well
all
and
all
a
nice
beer
not
mediocre
not
amazing
good
flavor
tracked
the
aroma
surprise
it
is
smooth
and
light
but
in
my
limited
experience
for
this
style
i
would
expect
more
flavor
d
easy
drinking
smells
and
looks
very
nice
but
the
taste
is
too
simple
the
beers
weight
is
too
much
for
its
limited
complexity
imho
this
was
a
very
boring
beer
for
me
it
had
a
good
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
was
just
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
a
mild
alcohol
nothing
really
exciting
the
taste
was
just
as
boring
it
was
good
but
plain
caramel
with
a
brown
sugar
finish
it
was
a
drinkable
beer
being
low
carbonation
and
a
full
bodied
beer
purchased
at
kokoman
fine
wines
and
liquors
in
new
mexico
an
excellent
summer
brew
thats
easy
to
drink
and
suitable
for
a
wide
range
of
palates
well
bodied
semisweet
and
texturely
appeasing
im
giving
this
one
8s
all
around
and
for
good
reason
this
is
one
great
abbey
ale
aroma
is
slightly
wild
and
yeasty
i
also
detect
a
wheat
quality
sharp
golden
color
favoring
a
faint
amber
tint
the
pour
created
a
massive
white
head
that
took
its
time
to
simmer
down
good
lacing
with
nice
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
unbelievably
filling
with
a
sweet
smooth
finish
awesome
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizen
at
first
but
more
complex
that
familiar
belgian
earthiness
is
present
backed
by
a
peppery
spicy
and
floral
taste
what
an
all
around
great
one
we
have
here
i
can
imagine
enjoying
this
on
any
occasion
i
had
a
couple
of
these
last
night
and
they
seemed
far
more
sweet
than
ones
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
dont
know
if
they
have
changed
anything
or
if
my
tastes
have
simply
changed
a
little
but
it
was
unpleasantly
sweet
last
night
thats
what
she
said
huge
foamy
white
head
no
matter
how
slow
you
pour
smell
is
equal
maltiness
and
hops
like
its
flavor
well
balanced
taste
with
plenty
of
both
hops
and
malt
it
is
a
bit
heavy
but
is
has
a
very
dry
finish
which
makes
it
so
drinkable
im
disappointed
that
you
only
get
11
2
ounces
an
empty
bottle
of
the
stuff
ways
more
than
a
traditional
empty
beer
bottle
i
know
small
batch
euro
beers
often
come
in
thicker
bottles
but
since
inbev
owns
them
im
now
assuming
that
8
ounces
of
beer
costs
more
than
8
ounces
of
glass
ill
probably
never
drink
it
again
di
could
have
a
couple
i
guess
you
really
have
to
like
spiced
beers
or
be
in
the
mood
for
one
the
clove
taste
is
so
strong
that
if
you
arent
expecting
it
as
i
wasnt
then
it
catches
you
off
guard
okay
mouthfeel
thin
and
light
but
its
got
enough
going
on
and
is
drinkable
enough
to
be
excused
not
great
but
worth
a
try
since
its
so
widely
available
as
the
name
entails
a
golden
blondish
colored
brew
with
a
decent
head
smell
has
slight
tone
of
cloves
and
sweet
notes
this
beer
has
a
unique
taste
that
is
sweet
and
refreshing
with
carbonation
and
then
an
aftertaste
that
switches
one
fruit
for
another
that
is
more
mild
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
summer
beer
as
well
as
for
winter
days
when
you
are
summer
dreaming
the
body
could
be
more
full
though
i
think
the
brewer
filtered
it
a
little
too
much
unlike
most
blondes
doesnt
have
a
great
body
but
ideas
that
head
in
the
right
direction
think
of
it
as
more
gwyneth
paltrow
rather
than
scarlett
johansen
drinkability
high
poured
into
a
red
wine
glass
which
is
a
little
embarassing
but
its
the
closest
in
shape
to
the
proper
glassware
moderate
head
pale
golden
orange
color
just
shy
of
being
perfectly
clear
very
attractive
smell
grainy
with
some
yeast
and
a
fresh
sweetness
taste
isnt
as
good
as
the
aroma
would
make
you
expect
too
processed
initial
impact
is
highly
carbonated
and
lacks
much
flavor
then
theres
a
sweet
bread
taste
mouthfeel
is
great
high
but
not
excessive
carbonation
and
significant
body
light
lacing
very
drinkable
but
failed
to
meet
my
very
high
expectations
da
good
starter
on
the
belgians
not
one
of
the
belgian
pale
ales
in
the
category
too
much
cloves
fairly
drinkable
beer
though
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
this
is
what
ill
drink
if
my
only
other
choices
are
maes
and
jupiler
taste
pears
apples
and
other
bright
summer
fruits
spicy
yeast
character
no
hop
bitterness
at
all
dry
finish
i
absolutely
loved
the
amazing
flavors
and
complex
combination
of
ingredients
in
this
brew
if
i
had
a
criticism
at
all
it
would
probably
be
that
it
was
just
a
little
bit
sweet
for
me
is
it
too
sweet
depends
on
your
tastes
i
guess
i
would
definitely
put
this
on
my
anytime
beer
list
recommended
overall
nice
abbey
beer
complex
and
spiced
not
the
best
belgium
blonde
but
highly
enjoyable
and
reasonably
priced
d
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
belgian
golden
ale
i
wonder
if
my
review
is
better
because
it
wasnt
stored
in
a
bottle
wasnt
slowly
shipped
overseas
and
was
bought
much
closer
to
the
source
taste
is
really
sweet
stick
in
the
back
of
your
throat
hard
to
swallow
sweet
i
tasted
sweet
honey
like
flavors
spiciness
but
the
alcohol
bite
was
not
masked
by
these
and
stuck
out
really
bad
no
hop
or
malt
flavor
just
a
sickening
sweetness
i
really
tried
to
like
it
let
it
warm
up
but
just
struggled
through
the
sweetness
the
whole
glass
dm
has
a
medium
body
with
an
average
smoothness
but
i
find
that
it
would
be
more
situated
as
a
dinner
paring
drink
somthing
to
go
with
a
nice
steak
then
something
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
however
i
did
find
it
quite
refreshing
if
they
could
figure
out
a
way
to
make
this
less
sweet
then
it
would
be
a
much
improved
beer
the
first
one
was
ok
but
by
the
middle
of
the
second
i
was
just
trying
to
finish
it
and
get
it
over
with
average
mouthfeel
but
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
i
may
try
this
again
ontap
d
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
see
this
one
being
a
gateway
belgian
for
some
people
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
belgian
d
a
bit
too
sweet
on
the
get
go
and
the
end
may
be
a
bit
too
bitter
after
that
initial
sweetness
listen
to
bighead
todd
and
the
monsters
when
quaffing
this
coolass

a
hard

beer
with
a
big
white
head
belgian
notes
in
the
nose
yeast
spice
and
pear
a
little
weak
on
the
palate
except
in
the
sweet
category
overtly
sweet
with
an
earthy
fruity
background
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
afterward
void
of
bitterness
fairly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
a
run
of
the
mill
brew
and
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
a
great
beer
for
a
90
degree
day
like
today
d
a
bit
light
of
yeast
character
but
enjoyable
and
drinkable
nice
earthy

d
i
could
drink
these
all

and
for

a
sixer
maybe
i
will
pours
out
a
light
orange
color
with
an
average
fluffy
head
very
bubbly
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
sugar
the
taste
is
of
citrus
and
heavy
on
the
malt
definite
orange
and
peach
flavor
it
has
a
nice
carbonation
to
match
this
style
overall
this
beer
is
just
too
average
i
feel
it
is
the
runofmill
belgian
pale
ale
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
poured
into

great
twofinger

that
remained
throughout
the
entire
drink
good
lacing
color
was
a
light

smelled
of
sweet
fruitiness
and
tasted
oh
so
sweet
taste
reminds
me
of
pecan
pie
leaves
a
slight
nutty
aftertaste
very
smooth
with
light
to
medium
body
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
all
in
all
a
respectable
but
not
great
beer
this
is
basically
a
shadow
of
a
good
belgian
pale
but
there
isnt
anything
actually
wrong
with
it
d
massmarketed
or
not
this
is
a
very
well
done
belgian
blonde
it
defines
the
style
if
all
massmarketed
beers
were
of
this
quality
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
poured

whit

for

unfiltered
beer
smell

coriander

too

flavor
taste
of
banana
clove
some
pepper
fruits
good
one
but
give
it
to
me
anytime
as
it
used
to
be
i
tried
this
beer
on
february
21
2008
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
this
beer
poured
an
translucent
orangygold
with
a
thin
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
was
slighty
yeasty
with
some
malty
and
hoppy
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
creamy
and
amply
carbonated
the
taste
was
dryish
yeasty
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
a
very
good
beer
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
with
nice
bubblage
and
good
sized
white
head
with
lots
of
lace
it
offers
a
light
alcohol
and
wheat
and
juniper
aroma
very
nice
midland
body
with
tingly
carbonation
and
lots
of
wheat
and
yeast
flavorings
nothing
highly
special
but
likeable
enough
and
a
drinkable
brew
poured
a
clear
golden
macro
color
with
a
decent
head
and
minimal
lacing
carbonation
is
whats
expected
from
a
belgian
blonde
smell
is
sweet
malty
bready
and
slightly
yeasty
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
at
the
end
there
are
much
better
belgian
brews
out
there
but
i
still
like
this
one
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
not
something
i
would
try
to
keep
on
hand
for
everyday
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
from
time
to
time
not
something
i
would
serve
to
try
to
inmpress
another
beer
lover
d
damn
fine
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
bpas
out
there
id
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
drinkability
on
this
on
is
pretty
good
its
a
lightish
blonde
ale
that
isnt
hard
to
drink
and
beats
the
pants
off
an
american
macro
d
though
this
ale
is
a
bit
too
sweet
it
is
still
a
fine
belgian
golden
though
it
seems
an
odd
thing
to
say
this
beer
can
actually
stand
being
served
slightly
colder
than
other
belgians

in
all

at

out
as

to
style
with

combination

all
coming
out
a
very
nice
light
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
though
this
style
of
beer
is
not
my
favorite
this
beer
opened
my
eyes
to
the
enjoyability
of
belgian
style
beers
d
despite
its
debits
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
granted
this
doesnt
necessarily
make
it
a
brilliant
example
of
the
brewing
art
but
its
not
bad
either
pours
a
dark
gold
with
about
an
inch
light
white
head
smells
of
bread
yeast
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
very
full

the
taste
is
almost
sickeningly

of

distinct

flavor

couldnt
even
make
my
way
all
the
way
through
this
beer
will
not
buy
again
i
think
its
too
sweet
and
filtered
for
a
belgian
blonde
on
top
of
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
in
the
first
place
which
is
why
this
is
getting
dumped
in
the
trash
better
than
expectedi
think
inbevanheuser
busch
association
causes
some
of
the
negative
reviews
on
b
a
i
brought
a
six
pack
of
this
to
a
straight
college
party
everybody
thought
i
was
nuts
and
then
i
gave
them
a
taste
and
they
ended
up
loving
it
i
guess
it
is
not
really
that
hard
to
beat
a
keg
of
natty
light
i
poured
it
into
the
first
available
glass
looked
smooth
and
clear
golden
sunset
color
smelled
of
yeast
esters
and
somewhat
banana
tastes
switches
in
and
out
of
malt
and
yeast
with
a
bitter
finish
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
is
decent
but
again
it
is
a
rich
sweet
beer
it
is
really
best
as
an
after
dinner
beer
pours
out
a
clear
gold
brew
with
a
huge
head
fairly
high
carbonation
has
a
grassy
hop
like
scent
very
faint
taste
is
very
unusual
its
very
much
belgian
but
lighter
i
was
expecting
this
to
taste
like
a
lager
from
its
appearance
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
not
too
bad
an
ok
beer
it
is
a
fine
belgian
pale
not
very
interesting
orval
does
it
much
better
mfd
creamywith
lots
of
carbonation
finishes
slightly
oily
not
the
best
belgian
ale
but
very
drinkable
disclaimer
this
is
my
second
beer
review
and
im
using
my
first
as
a
template
d
good
drinkability
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
belgians
but
a
good
intro
into
the
style
very
light
refreshing
and
fruity
pours
a
very
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
of
large
off
white
bubbles
aroma
is
spicy
ginger
and
yeast
taste
is
more
spice
ginger
and
nutmeg
reminds
me
of
a
ginger
snap
cookie
medium
to
light
body
creamy
spicy
aftertaste
lingers
easy
to
drink
and
interesting
better
than
many
blondes
ive
had
recently
and
much
cheaper
ill
keep
this
one
on
hand
not
much
to
add
except
that
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
a
decent
beer
to
have
every
now
and
then
no
do
not
try
to
compare
it
to
the
greats
it
is
a
light
heavyweight
fighting
in
the
heavyweight
divisionbut
thats
o
k
i
like
underdogs
this
beer
seems
to
be
getting
pushed
harder
and
harder
in
my
area
and
routinely
gets
placed
in
the
best
of
belgium
sampler
this
also
includes
stella
and
hoogarden
there
is
so
much
wrong
with
that
concept
anyways
this
beer
may
get
a
bit
of
bad
press
because
of
the
macro
tarnishment
but
it
is
still
nice
to
see
belgians
getting
into
hands
of
people
even
if
it
is
in
this
way
color
is
bright
gold
with
a
very
nice
airy
white
soapy
head
that
leaves
very
nice
lacing
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
body
is
extremely
clear
with
no
yeast
sediment
to
be
found
this
was
a
bit
too
clean
for
me
but
others
may
prefer
it
aroma
is
slightly
floral
with
a
biscuity
profile
and
decent
yeast
presence
taste
is
crisp
when
the
beer
is
cold
as
it
warms
the
sugars
come
through
but
are
overtaken
by
a
cornlike
vegetal
flavor
a
bit
grainy
at
the
swallow
and
dry
with
a
slightly
synthetic
feel
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
get
in
a
restaurant
if
faced
with
few
options
but
not
what
i
would
call
truly
belgian
it
bit
too
polished
and
clean
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
with
a
mild
presence
from
the
belgian
yeast
sweet
creamy
and
smooth
flavor
of
honeyed
maltiness
not
cloying
or
overly
dry
and
bubbly
like
some
belgians
can
be
extremely
smooth
creamy
and
drinkable
especially
for
a
style
im
not
generally
fond
of
this
is
definitely
worth
another
try
and
i
was
impressed
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
special
but
it
pairs
alright
with
a
cheese
plate
poured
from
a
bottle
its
a
decent
looking
beer
golden
and
oddly
crystal
clear
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
its
got
a
nice
white
head
that
has
decent
lacing
if
youre
into
that
the
nose
is
rather
mild
with
sweet
fruity
notes
but
nothing
noteworhty
the
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
spices
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
the
finish
is
kinda
syrupy
sweet
not
exactly
to
my
liking
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
two
the
sweet
syrupy
character
of
this
beer
could
get
to
be
rather
cloying
beyond
one
or
two
this
beer
is
pretty
satisfying
and
it
wont
offend
many
palates
d
a
nice
blond
very
easy
drinking
more
going
on
in
the
flavor
dept
than
many
of
the
more
plain
blondes
a
pleasing
and
subtle
flavor
makes
this
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
right
home
about
overall
contrasting
and
interesting
aroma
and
taste
superior
to
the
brune
but
let
down
by
the
sickly
sweet
mouthfeel
quite
nice
really
not
front
of
the
line
stuff
here
but
not
far
back
from
the
front
few
a
nice
drinking
beer
a
good
light
start
for
those
interested
in
sampling
belgian
style
beers
verdict
drinkable
at
best
but
too
sweet
to
be
a
belgian
pale
ale
closer
to
a
dubbel
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
moderately
priced
around
8
for
six
with
a
solid
abv
and
a
great
taste
you
dont
come
across
every
day
as
stated
carbonation
is
pretty
high
but
it
works
medium
body
goes
down
pretty
quick
i
think
id
tire
of
this
after
a
couple
bottles
but
until
that
point
id
rate
it
quite
drinkable
pours
a
straw
like
golden
color
very
effervescent
with
a
massive
white
fluffy
head
aromas
are
quite
estery
with
bright
clove
and
citrus
a
little
banana
and
an
overall
candy
like
perfume
boquet
on
the
palate
the
spices
continue
to
come
through
though
it
has
a
nice
firm
malty
toasty
flavor
the
hops
are
evident
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
bitter
note
the
floral
sense
presupposes
nobel
varieties
maybe
saaz
a
medium
high
carbonation
delivers
a
nice
fluffy
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
low
body
and
a
nice
phenolic
finish
overall
i
always
passed
this
beer
up
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
bottles
with
two
other
belgian
beers
in
an
18
pack
and
i
can
imagine
that
i
will
finish
the
leffe
blondes
first
d
for
the
sweet
taste
yes
but
the
carbonation
and
earthy
hops
throw
this
one
off
a
little
quite
nice
and
worthwhile
but
not
complex
the
taste
was
biscuit
malty
up
front
with
a
faint
hopiness
on
the
finish
in
the
mouth
it
is
highly
carbonated
leaves
a
bitterness
on
its
exit
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
it
might
go
good
with
a
meal
like
a
meat
lovers
pizza
or
burger
to
cut
the
fat
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
blond
nice
rocky
white
head
that
was
very
large
but
fell
a
bit
quickly
straw
colored
and
brilliant
clarity
phenolic
nose
nice
yeast
character
in
the
taste
along
with
a
subtle
fruitiness
and
grainy
finish
light
bodied
but
full
of
character
beautiful
amber
gradient
with
light
bubbles
and
a
thin
head
that
retained
just
a
little
bit
throughout
the
nose
was
floral
and
had
light
hints
of
tomatoes
very
tart
the
first
taste
was
almost
spicy
kind
of
barbequed
a
taste
which
followed
through
the
finish
though
it
seemed
to
evolve
as
such
a
fruity
and
flowery
taste
also
showed
up
from
time
to
time
overall
id
say
its
pretty
drinkable
if
not
an
ordinary
purchase
d
i
found
this
quite
drinkable
and
would
go
back
for
more
a
nice
beer
all
by
itself
but
even
better
with
food
the
flavors
were
fine
but
the
overall
blend
of
them
needs
some
balance
and
work
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
very
very
enjoyable
brew
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
good
beer
not
a
seesion
beer
but
a
change
of
pace
for
me
ive
had
leffe
blond
more
than
a
few
times
but
now
that
ive
reviewed
it
i
probably
wont
buy
it
unless
i
am
going
to
be
brewing
a
bpa
and
need
some
for
comparison

bière
agréable
facile

one
of
the
most
exceptional
colors
i
have
ever
seen
pours
a
wondrous
orange
and
amber
color
with
possibly
the
biggest
head
ever
it
literally
sat
at
23
inches
until
i
could
no
longer
contain
myself
and
had
to
start
drinking
it
the
taste
has
a
nice
heartiness
to
it
with
some
great
biscuit
flavors
coming
through
and
a
delicate
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
finish
is
very
clean
with
a
little
sweetness
the
head
alone
made
this
beer
a
great
choice
for
me
overall
a
lovely
beer
this
is
a
fine
belgian
pale
from
leffe
in
the
end
i
wound
up
drinking
3
before
telling
myself
i
needed
to
enjoy
it
again
another
day
a
great
buy
and
a
great
reccomendation
for
anyone
looking
for
a
flavourful
beer
delicious
to
the
end
i
would
probably
drink
leffe
blonde
again
but
only
once
a
year
d
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
not
on
the
high
end
of
the
offerings
from
belgium
but
not
a
bad
choice
it
is
one
of
the
only
of
the
style
available
in
mississippi
due
to
its
lower
abv
will
drink
again
but
not
too
many
at
the
time
due
to
the
sweetness
drinkability
nice
smooth
and
easy
to
knock
back
leffe
blonde
pours
2
12
fingers
of
bonewhite
froth
atop
a
light
golden
body
outstanding
and
the
ommegang
glass
is
exquisitely
laced
on
the
way
down
the
nose
is
disappointinga
good
deal
of
wheat
comes
forth
but
dominates
the
taste
is
more
complex
than
the
smell
indicates
thankfully
the
wheat
is
still
strong
but
i
also
detect
some
orange
and
a
faint
honey
taste
quite
nice
i
thought
the
carbonation
might
be
overwhelming
but
this
wasnt
the
case
having
a
couple
of
these
is
far
from
taxing
a
nice
pale
ale
although
the
flavor
is
almost
more
reminiscent
of
a
light
german
lager
as
i
think
about
it
something
in
this
brew
reminds
me
of
makeup
weird
d
if
they
cost
the
same
id
drink
this
instead
of
budweiser
any
day
just
an
average
beer
overall
it
has
an
all
right
look
to
it
a
nice
straw
color
with
great
head
but
almost
no
lacing
not
much
of
a
scent
a
little
maltiness
coming
up
from
the
brew
all
right
taste
some
malts
but
mostly
bland
goes
down
fine
not
great
and
not
bad
i
doubt
ill
try
it
again
but
wouldnt
dissuade
any
one
from
giving
it
a
shot
seemed
more
like
a
blonde
ale
than
a
pale
ale
too
d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
and
find
myself
going
back
for
more
the
amount
of
carbonation
keeps
me
from
literally
gulping
it
down
like
i
am
not
suppose
to
do
d
a
decent
beer
it
wouldnt
be
number
one
on
my
list
but
i
would
most
likely
drink
it
again
overall
quaffable
plenty
pleasant
enough
to
enjoy
if
somewhat
blandly
industrial
id
have
it
again
gladly
d
an
ok
drink
but
after
this
6
pack
im
prolly
done
with
it
not
a
bad
choice
thou
d
just
a
solid
workman
like
belgian
in
the
line
of
a
hoegarden
or
stella
servicable
if
a
bit
plain
but
good
enough
to
keep
you
interested
what
an
awesome
beer
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
to
discover
such
a
treasure
almost
like
a
super
hefeweizen
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
bronze
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
has
decent
staying
power
the
aroma
is
wonderful
full
of
banana
fruits
and
spices
the
taste
is
superrich
full
of
exciting
and
bold
flavors
that
strongly
complement
the
aroma
has
a
superb
mouthfeel
that
sticks
to
the
palate
and
taste
buds
flavor
is
longlasting
and
very
satisfying
a
relatively
strong
alcohol
percentage
is
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
giving
this
a
perfect
five
but
the
6
6
is
really
not
felt
so
much
as
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
detect
behind
a
creamy
and
rich
taste
definitely
recommended
a
musttry
poured
into
chimay
goblet
forms
a
thick
creamy
white
long
lasting
head
heavy
lacing
remains
on
side
of
glass
sweet
banana
aroma
taste
is
slightly
spicy
mostly
clove
and
banana
perhaps
a
whiff
of
pepper
a
decent
beer
good
for
an
intro
to
the
style
but
there
are
better
belgian
pale
ales
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
you
will
find
a
clear
light
amber
color
it
is
topped
by
a
very
tall
white
fluffy
head
there
is
lots
of
sticky
lacing
and
very
good
retention
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
banana
and
cloves
the
taste
is
made
of
sweet
malt
and
some
light
hop
bitterness
there
is
also
some
very
slight
graininess
and
some
light
spices
not
a
bad
beer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
bpa
good
flavours
especially
for
something
owned
by
a
giant
conglomerate
could
definitely
drink
this
again
might
buy
sixpack
next
time
good
call
not
bad
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
syrupy
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
session
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
i
was
quite
light
and
reminded
me
of
a
german
hefe
d
low
abv
and
somewhat
bland
kind
of
boring
but
pleasant
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
night
but
i
would
only
want
to
if
a
better
belgian
wasnt
available
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
good
enough
to
drink
not
bad
its
crisp
and
clean
and
fairly
tasty
not
my
favorite
belgian
pale
but
i
id
try
it
again
drinkability
this
is

merely
decent

after
the
last
beer
attacked
my
senses
like
a
drunk
zero
pilot
on
kamikazee
run
i
figured
id
go
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
pours
a
clear
gold
color
w
a
finger
of
fluffy
whiteness
which
lasts
left
incredible
lacing
all
the
way
down
a
nose
thats
tangy
and
wheaty
with
a
tinge
of
hop
a
sweet
tangy
flavor
w
a
nice
wheatmalt
profile
balanced
w
the
hop
bitterness
some
caramel
undertones
detected
a
nice
med
body
w
plenty
of
dextrins
to
let
the
flavor
linger
this
a
a
great
beer
it
was
purchased
in
a
11
2
oz
bottle
but
i
think
they
should
sell
this
stuff
in
40
s
i
know
id
drink
the
shit
out
of
em
pretty
solid
but
unspectacular
belgian
and
something
just
seems
a
bit
off
in
it
but
its
enjoyable
and
an
easy
drinker
nonetheless
and
it
seems
to
be
quite
readily
available
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
leffe
it
poured
well
and
had
an
exceptional
taste
but
as
far
as
a
belgian
blonde
goes
it
was
not
the
best
i
would
rate
it
as
a
very
drinkable
but
average
blonde
all
in
all
it
was
a
beer
i
would
definately
drink
again
and
i
would
proudly
drink
but
it
did
not
stick
out
in
my
mind
d
smooth
and
delicious
with
a
distinct
sweet
fruity
flavor
perhas
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
great
well
balanced
beer
otherwise
drinkable
and
certainly
preferable
to
most
local
chinese
macro
pale
lagers
but
chimay
and
duvel
are
also
available
at
the
carrefour
so
why
bother
with
this
poured
into
a

bottle
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the

smells
of
sweet

bananas
and
a
little
spice
tastes
of
sweet
malt
sweet
fruits
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
mouthfeel

this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
will
most
likley
pass
it
up
next
time
drinkability
an
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
the
intensity
of
the
flavor
is
memorable
i
feel
it
is
sweet
but
i
easily
drank
the
6
i
had
enjoyable
but
probably
not
an
everyweekend
beer
worth
a
try
leffe
blonde
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
an
enormous
white
head
from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
banana
and
clove
lots
of
clove
so
much
so
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
swear
this
is
a
hefeweizen
clove
hits
me
quickly
up
front
in
the
taste
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
that
is
noticeable
in
the
middle
but
only
just
for
a
moment
before
the
banana
flavor
kicks
in
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
not
quite
heavy
but
nice
thick
and
chewy
drinkability
is
also
good
i
could
like
a
few
of
these
d
average
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
give
this
one
another
shot
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
i
wasnt
too
impressed
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
poured
from
a
chilled
bottle
into
my
favorite
glass
a
stemware
type
beer
glass
medium
gold
color
with
an
awesome
aroma
i
wish
they
made
this
in
cologne
the
head
stuck
around
for
quite
awhile
but
i
had
this
as
my
evening
snack
so
the
whole
drink
went
fast
taste
is
of
bananas
and
bread
all
in
all
pretty
good
medium
mouthfeel
high
on
the
drinkability
i
like
it
the
best
before
date
on
the
bottle
was

i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
may
buy
another
six
pack
but

is
still
my
favorite

very

drink
wow
i
found
my
new
favorite
everyday
beer
will
be
keeping
a
case
of
this
on
hand
at
all
times
my
first
nonmainstream
belgian
beer
the
first
time
i
tried
this
i
loved
it
my
first
impression
was
that
of
a
wheat
beer
with
a
shot
of
sherry
but
since
trying
better
beers
i
can
see
that
there
are
some
flaws
namely
the
oversweetness
and
lack
of
complexity
does
not
seem
as
good
from
the
bottle
as
ontap
but
still
a
decent
drink
and
recommended
for
anyone
who
likes
belgians
and
isnt
adverse
to
sweetness
pours
a
pretty
golden
color
with
tiny
columns
of
rising
bubbles
thick
and
foamy
white
head
with
fair
retention
patches
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
on
the
hoppy
side
and
has
a
nice
spiced
undertone
as
well
mediumbodied
and
spicy
with
hops
and
yeast
flavors
the
flavor
profile
is
not
as
complex
as
many
belgians
but
it
is
still
pretty
tasty
the
finish
is
spicy
and
fruity
and
lingers
a
bit
above
average
overall
pours
very
clear
with
a
bright
amber
gold
highlights
color
and
minimal
head
in
spite
of
a
constant
upward
stream
of
bubbles
the
aromas
are
mostly
sweet
ones
with
an
overlay
of
spicyness
and
some
pungent
doughy
yeast
elements
not
much
depth
to
the
aroma
though
on
the
palate
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overplayed
and
the
yeast
notes
a
bit
cloying
whats
pleasing
are
the
spices
which
build
in
the
second
half
and
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
intense
too
much
so
overall
this
is
an
ok
belgian
pale
ale
but
theres
nothing
to
separate
it
from
any
pack

with

very
pleasing
bitter

finish
but
i
found
the
alcohol
comes
through
as
it
warmed
even
slightly
compromising
the
drinkability
factor
a
touch
gassy
also
took
away
from
what
started
out
as
a
perfectly
acceptable
beer
overall
a
very
flavorfull
and
delicious
beer
its
by
far
not
the
best
belgian
that
ive
had
but
its
a
solid
brew
to
say
the
least
and
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
that
i
had
i
hope
to
see
it
more
readily
available
in
southern
ontario
hopefully
in
something
other
than
a
gift
pack
d
medium
ill
never
drink
one
again
but
i
could
see
someone
having
a
lot
of
these
a
nice
drinking
beer
it
seems
a
bit
stale
i
cant
keep
from
thinking
about
the
maltiness
after
this
beer
i
drank
an
urquel
and
found
similarities
in
sweetness
had
this
at
winking
lizard
bottle
pours
into
the
goblet
a
pale
golden
color
with
significant
weizen
like
white
thick
head
smell
is
heavy
on
banana
and
clove
can
pick
up
some
belgian
spices
and
yeasty
like
taste
is
delicious
and
creamy
banana
and
clove
flavors
come
to
the
front
of
my
tongue
carbonation
is
smooth
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
but
it
is
quite
good
poured
in
a
leffe
glass
very
good
appearance
a
clear
vibrant
gold
but
not
much
of
a
head
otherwise
this
could
have
been
a
5
the
smell
was
leaning
away
from
the
cereal
sort
of
smell
i
expected
and
gave
a
pretty
distinct
sweet
smell
the
taste
was
also
pretty
malty
sweet
maybe
fruity
too
along
with
some
of
the
belgian
yeast
funkearthiness
a
nicely
drinkable
belgian
pale
ale
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
some
of
the
higher

belgians
draught
pours
golden
with
with
white
creamy
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
long
time
has
somewhat
of
a
citrusy
taste
tastes
a
lot
like
a
hefeweizen
aroma
is
citrusy
and
malty
mouthfeel
has
good
medium
feel
to
it
lacing
on
glass
was
pretty
good
i
wish
i
could
find
the
brune
where
i
live
d
awesomely
drinkable
with
a
bit
more
flavor
this
would
have
been
a
5
an
excellent
gateway
beer
into
the
world
of
belgians
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
a
clear
golden
colour
with
a
foamy
white
head
holds
up
well
with
some
lacing
the
nose
has
some
spicy
yeasty
notes
and
theres
a
sweet
scent
that
i
just
cant
describe
taste
is
lightly
fruity
spicy
and
bitter
a
good
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
more
bpa
that
i
would
rather
drink
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
a
good
crossover
for
newbies
into
the
world
of
belgians
overall
an
enjoyable
and
solid
belgian
beer
apparently
rather
commercial
but
im
not
complaining
plus
its
harder
to
find
than
many
most
obscure
belgian
beers
if
i
could
get
it
closer
to
home
at
the
good
price
i
was
able
to
find
it
for
id
get
it
more
often
if
you
enjoy
belgian
beers
its
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
are
curious
about
trying
some
belgian
beer
this
is
certainly
worth
a
shot
d
ok
drinkability
but
the
flavors
could
be
too
much
after
a
while
not
really
refreshing
either
pours
a
golden
with
quite
a
decent
head
but
not
a
lot
of
lacing
for
a
belgian
quite
bready
at
first
smell
followed
by
light
banana
and
then
clove
the
taste
is
fairly
mellow
but
exhibits
similar
notes
as
the
smell
some
more
noticeable
clove
on
the
finish
along
with
a
definite
but
not
out
of
place
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
on
the
lighter
side
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
brought
a
six
pack
of
this
camping
recently
it
was
hot
and
humid
and
this
stuff
really
hit
the
spot
went
with
a
variety
of
foods
and
was
relatively
easy
on
the
wallet
i
even
converted
one
of
my
stella
artois
drinking
friends
with
this
beer
not
the
most
ravishing
belgian
on
the
planet
but
not
bad
and
one
id
overlooked
in
the
past
drinkability
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
but
i
have
no
real
desire
to
after
the
first
perhaps
my
rating
will
change
after
another
but
i
doubt
it
i
bought
a
six
pack
so
it
has
a
chance
for
redemption
but
as
of
now
i
probably
wont
be
buying
again
anytime
soon
i
actually
might
choose
this
over
the
brune
next
time
mouthfeel
is
way
too
syrupy
for
a
style
that
i
expect
to
be
crisp
and
dry
not
right
in
my
book
still
it
tastes
pretty
good
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
make
itself
felt
so
i
suppose
its
pretty
drinkable
however
i
could
still
think
of
a
number
of
belgians
id
go
to
first
to
scratch
either
my
pale
ale
or
tripel
itch
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
on
the
cloying
side
and
in
general
crispness
lacks
here
the
taste
is
certainly
good
with
some
mild
bitterness
balancing
the
fruity
malt
sweetness
there
is
a
lack
of
complexity
however
as
this
scrubbed
clear
version
of
a
belgian
ale
comes
across
as
mass
produced
the
mouthfeel
reduces
it
drinkability
for
me
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
a
real
belgian
but
still
it
is
a
good
beer
poured
a
thick
mousselike
cream
colored
head
that
held
like
a
champ
transparent
golden
beer
just
about
matches
the
color
of
the
can
smells
like
it
was
made
with
belgian
yeast
a
bit
doughy
with
a
touch
of
creamysugary
desert
carmalized
sugar
and
apricot
with
a
solid
malt
base
and
a
bit
of
alcoholic
bit
to
hold
back
the
sweet
flavors
the
mouthfeel
would
be
thicker
if
it
werent
for
the
alcohol
which
manages
to
lighten
up
the
body
and
cut
the
sweeter
flavors
nice
belgian
yeast
flavors
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
what
more
can
you
ask
for
i
had
this
one
on
tap
during
a
recent
trip
to
brussels
this
brew
is
a
clear
and
light
goldenamber
hued
liquid
the
head
is
of
modest
size
but
stable
and
foamy
the
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
yeast
malt
and
grass
it
smells
a
bid
sweeter
than
it
tastes
with
a
notable
caramel
aroma
as
you
drink
the
brew
a
hint
of
alcohol
comes
forth
the
body
is
full
and
nice
a
bit
more
yeast
and
light
malt
comes
out
in
the
taste
the
carbonation
is
present
but
a
little
more
restrained
than
i
expected
i
enjoyed
the
beer
with
smoked
salmon
and
asparagus
it
was
a
nice
accompaniment
and
a
worthy
beer
final
statement
so
many
people
bash
leffe
for
being
too
commercial
well
its
not
stella
leffe
is
still
a
great
beer
for
people
who
are
not
completely
in
love
with
belgian
abbeys
such
as
myself
the
fact
that
its
filtered
and
cleaner
makes
me
like
it
more
to
be
honest
it
still
has
a
nice
flavour
to
it
and
i
will
still
continue
to
buy
it
every
so
often
poured
into
a
leffe
goblet
a
nice
yellow
heady
beer
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
ale
same
style
of
characteristics
dryish
but
sweet
nothing
too
exciting
but
yet
nothing
to
really
complain
about
alcohol
is
there
but
not
easily
detected
a
good
belgian
session
beer
after
my
initial
happiness
i
found
that
the
more
i
got
through
the
glass
the
more
the
thick
mouthfeel
and
the
complex
flavours
made
me
feel
bloated
it
was
very
nice
but
one
was
enough
i
do
not
have
the
urge
to
try
it
again
great
on
its
own
but
not
one
for
drinking
whilst
on
a
night
out
great
belgian
ale
that
is
not
too
hard
to
find
has
a
decent
aroma
and
yellow
in
color
has
a
very
hefeweisen
yeast
flavor
banana
flavor
and
is
nice
and
malty
i
cant
quite
pick
out
the
hops
but
they
balance
out
the
malts
fairly
well
this
beer
is
probably
a
little
higher
in
alcohol
than
is
detected
by
the
tongue
making
it
a
nice
drinkable
beer
with
a
kick
very
pleasant
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
nice

lots
of
bubbles
fluffy

clove
with
a

edge
body
is

carbonated
taste
has
a
lot
going
on
spice
sweet
fruit
and
tart
citrus
are
all
there
good
stuff
from
start
to
finish
chewy
full
mouthfeel
slight
dustiness
like
the
astringency
of
an
old
claret
medium
bitterness
and
a
slight
cloying
sweetness
that
would
probably
preclude
this
being
a
session
beer
need
a
lager
to
wash
it
down
mouthfeel
is
good
nothing
to
take
off
for
there
carbonation
felt
about
right
etc
drinkability
is
fine
too
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
but
would
do
just
fine
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
crystal
clear
brass
with
active
carbonation
and
a
moderate
sized
fluffy
head
smells
of
pale
toasty
malts
a
good
heaping
of
grain
subdued
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
a
wortlike
smell
creeps
in
taste
is
very
worty
with
a
bit
of
a
bread
taste
and
some
esters
in
there
somewhere
finishes
cloyingly
sweet
with
what
do
you
know
a
saccharine
flavor
just
like
the
last
4
or
so
beers
ive
had
in
the
last
couple
of
days
boring
and
just
plain
gross
mouthfeel
is
too
fulsome
for
me
here
and
the
carbonation
does
nothing
to
liven
this
up
im
having
a
hard
time
completing
this
for
me
leffe
blonde
is
the
belgian
beer
i
always
go
back
to
a
great
comfort
beer
there
are
others
i
like
better
in
certain
ways
or
for
certain
times
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
ive
had
in
this
particular
style
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
and
velvety
smooth
with
a
clean
refreshing
finish
all
and
all
a
nice
summer
beer
surely
worth
a
try
this
was
really
an
afterthought
purchase
since
i
dont
normally
seek
out
leffe
particularly
the
blonde
for
a
variety
of
reasons
still
i
grabbed
a
sixer
at
my
local
and
enjoyed
the
experience
poured
the
11
2
into
my
deep
duvel
tulip
glass
wow
big
head
on
this
bad
boy
a
bleach
white
bubbly
foam
with
lace
hanging
on
for
dear
life
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
clean
appearance
golden
yellow
with
some
carbonation
aroma
is
loaded
with
bananas
both
ripe
and
aged
with
notes
of
vanilla
coriander
and
camamille
the
taste
more
or
less
reflects
the
nose
bananas
and
vanilla
rule
the
day
with
some
citrusy
wisps
in
the
background
only
a
whisper
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
accented
by
camamille
moderate
mouthfeel
with
continued
light
carbonation
its
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
in
one
sitting
this
is
imported
by
cub
here
so
that
means
its
in
a
lot
of
bars
that
might
otherwise
only
have
premium
choices
like
stella
artois
therefore
its
my
fallback
beer
so
i
can
actually
drink
something
that
has
some
flavour
abv
well
hidden
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
never
had
a
belgian
it
is
a
nice
example
to
work
you
into
the
genre
giver
er
a
try
d
definitely
deserves
buying
the
six
pack
im
going
to
enjoy
another
one
right
now
d
this
is
quite
tasty
and
very
drinakable
i
will
purchase
this
one
again

im
a
bit
impressed
the

watered
down
version
of
the
smell
though
it
still
taste
good
it
feels
a
bit
pasturized
though
im
not
sure
it
actually
is
this
is
like
the
budweiser
of
belgian
pale
ales
a
step
above
stella
the
feel
is
firm
and
not
watery
maybe
a
tad
too
carbonated
a
very
drinkable
belgian
blonde
one
i
wont
have
any
issues
with
drinking
a
sixer
of
it
is
what
it
is
sure
there
might
be
better
examples
of
the
style
there
might
be
cheaper
examples
too
there
might
even
be
better
examples
that
are
also
cheaper
but
um
i
dont
really
know
where
im
going
with
this
just
your
average
bpa
nothing
more
give
it
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
otherwise
id
pass
chicago
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
three
finger
white
head
with
a
easy
pour
that
held
to
a
half
inch
with
a
spotty
lace
first
whiff
is
of
banana
aroma
that
turns
to
clove
and
spice
taste
all
i
could
think
of
was
easter
ham
studed
with
clove
clove
and
spice
predominate
the
taste
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
through
the
beer
maybe
not
the
best
but
still
tasty
it
is
a
good
beer
typical
of
its
style
but
not
examplary
of
it
it
is
a
very
approachable
belgian
blonde
it
is
quite
a
delicious
treat
however
in
comparison
to
other
beers
of
its
style
it
although
very
delicious
lacks
the
strength
of
taste
and
of
alcohol
but
not
taste
of
alcohol
to
make
it
great
among
its
kind
drinkability
easy
to
drink
solid
but
not
spectacular
the
first
to
drink
from
a
fresh
keg
had
2
half
pints
on
the
first
day
1
half
pint
on
the
second
luckily
social
occasions
had
given
me
an
excuse
to
visit
the
local
grad
club
for
4
days
straight
the
beer
was
served
at
around
8
degree
celcius
in
a
leffe
glass
thin
head
floated
1cm
above
the
33cl
mark
the
smell
is
good
like
raw
straw
water
with
a
hint
of
spritz
a
very
clean
taste
with
marked
floral
notes
from
the
belgian
yeast
slight
raw
sweetness
very
clean
and
drinkable
it
washed
down
with
conversation
too
easily
a
very
drinkable
and
sensible
choice
for
the
rainy
spring
days
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
medium
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
little
lacing
carbonation
is
noticeable
but
doesnt
seem
to
help
aroma
is
interesting
floral
with
something
i
can
only
explain
as
champagne
that
its
in
your
face
has
a
fruity
floral
start
with
that
same
champagne
finish
its
almost
like
an
alcohol
sting
but
not
quite
you
cant
miss
this
beer
while
youre
in
belgium
and
its
worth
a
shot
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
filling
medium
carbonation
cheers
good
very
straightforward
refreshing
better
stuff
out
there
but
would
certainly
drink
again
gave
this
one
a
try
last
evening
the
brew
poured
to
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
had
great
retention
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
chunky
lacing
along
the
side
of
the
goblet
the
aroma
is
fair
actually
a
little
disappointing
as
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
but
i
did
notice
a
dominant
clove
scent
bananas
sweet
malts
and
a
additional
fruit
like
quality
the
taste
was
good
based
on
what
i
noticed
in
the
nose
the
clove
flavor
seemed
to
take
a
step
back
from
the
aroma
as
i
notice
the
bananas
and
malt
complexity
taking
a
step
up
over
all
this
beer
is
not
as
dynamic
as
i
was
hoping
but
it
was
a
easy
drink
one
i
would
get
one
again
but
as
far
as
belgiums
i
think
that
there
are
many
more
impressive
ones
out
there
d
although
i
was
hoping
for
much
more
this
beer
still
doesnt
really
make
the
mark
for
some
reason
i
thought
leffe
was
gonna
be
top
notch
if
this
is
representitive
of
the
brewery
theyre
far
from
the
top
of
the
pops
a
great
everyday
beer
with
dinner
i
think
a
little
too
strong
and
maybe
too
sweet
at
times
to
be
a
session
drinker
per
se
but
i
could
see
it
fitting
in
nicely
with
a
steak
and
some
caramelized
onions
or
something
along
those
lines
this
seems
like
the
belgian
ale
for
those
who
like
hefeweizens
banana
and
clove
with
little
hop
bitterness
of
phenols
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
lower
alcohol
by
volume
compared
to
other
belgian
ales
recommended
pours
to
a
generous
white
head
and
lacing
and
deep
golden
color
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
peppery
and
unmistakably
belgian
flavor
is
sweet
malty
and
spicy
the
way
this
feels
in
the
mouth
is
superbslight
alcohol
warmthtingle
and
just
the
right
amount
of
viscosity
a
fine
belgian
blond
to
sip
all
year
round
medium
goldenamber
with
a
large
white
fluffy
head
nice
lacing
smells
of
banana
clove
spices
orange
light
crisp
hop
and
a
light
smooth
malt
base
wheat
has
top
billing
in
the
flavor
supported
by
strawberry
grass
honey
and
spices
perfumy
but
nice
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
lightly
dry
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
stupid
me
thought
it
was
actually
the
style
of
a
blonde
given
the
name
not
a
fan
of
blondes
and
compared
to
that
style
i
rather
liked
this
one
though
i
thought
it
quite
a
bit
off
style
coming
here
i
find
its
a
belgian
pale
ale
suddenly
it
all
makes
sense
and
also
im
suddenly
less
impressed
with
this
beer
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
its
nothing
special
in
the
world
of
belgian
pale
ales
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
bham
uk
a
white
ring
and
paper
thin
pool
of
carbonation
sit
atop
a
copperamber
colored
brew
aromas
of
pungent
fruits
like
apples
pears
green
bananas
dominate
while
a
softer
herbal
ester
and
citric
astringent
drift
between
whiffs
big
yeasty
bread
taste
fermented
pear
lightly
roasted
barley
wheat
and
raw
sugar
sweetness
that
takes
shape
as
it
develops
a
little
ways
down
notes
of
unripe
green
banana
and
fermented
oranges
and
vinous
notes
become
more
apparent
thin
body
and
moderate
carbonation
leaves
a
smooth
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
turns
creamier
as
it
warms
the
finish
has
a
yeasty
profile
with
notes
of
dry
grains
citric
sweetness
and
slight
sour
vinous
astringent
d
better
than
i
expected
the
flavor
is
such
that
it
seems
that
it
could
pair
well
with
many
different
types
of
foods
recommended
a
belgian
ale
that
pours
a
great
golden
color
color
a
romantic
white
head
a
somewhat
higher
than
average
carbonation
almost
like
delirium
interesting
combination
of
yeast
and
friut
not
a
very
strong
alcoholic
presence
in
the
brew
i
can
see
it
popular
as
a
affordable
belgian
product
for
a
large
american
novice
consumer
ive
had
this
one
before
cant
imagine
why
i
havent
held
it
in
higher
esteem
i
love
this
beer
this
isnt
an
amazing
belgian
but
i
think
its
a
nice
example
of
belgian
characteristics
this
amber
beer
is
heavy
on
the
yeast
flavor
with
what
seems
to
be
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
not
much
bitterness
but
this
a
very
smooth
and
tasty
beer
a
good
companion
to
a
meal
and
worth
trying
d
not
a
bad
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
all
in
all
an
average
beer
that
im
not
sure
i
will
buy
again
lovely
blonde
overall
the
drinkability
is
good
i
would
have
this
beer
again
golden
color
with
a
nice
fine
bubbled
head
trails
of
lacing
are
left
behind
with
each
sip
steady
flow
of
carb
gives
it
continuous
life
first
smells
i
pick
up
are
citrus
this
is
followed
by
a
honey
sweetness
taste
is
prominantly
sweet
up
front
this
is
followed
by
some
banana
flavors
finished
with
a
distinct
hoppy
note
also
pick
up
some
peppery
spice
flavors
a
little
bit
on
the
dry
side
in
the
finish
with
some
alcohol
bite
overall
a
nice
belgian
beer
nothing
great
or
outstanding
about
it
just
a
solid
drinker
that
you
dont
need
to
think
to
hard
about
and
this
was
a
very
fresh
brew
thanks
to
my
great
son
studying
overseas
in
amsterdam
i
was
brought
this
for
the
unique
chance
to
enjoy
fresh
from
the
brewer
my
first
belgian
pale
ale
came
in
a
variety
pack
with
stella
artois
and
hoegaarden
from
sams
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
chalice
massive
head
initially
with
some
large
soapy
bubbles
that
eventually
dissipates
swirling
brings
back
a
nice
thick
albeit
thin
head
with
nice
lacing
i
couldnt
discern
very
much
from
the
smell
some
sweet
malt
yeast
alcohol
the
taste
at
first
had
a
strange
metallic
background
but
eventually
wore
off
to
a
mild
banana
spice
minimal
hops
taste
with
the
metallica
taste
disappearing
as
the
glass
slowly
empties
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
my
taste
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
these
once
this
6
is
gone
d
pretty
high
for
the
style
overall
a
good
if
fairly
nondescript
beer
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
little
bit
of
film
the
smell
is
sweet
and
yeasty
but
not
too
complex
the
taste
is
also
very
straight
forward
and
quite
reminiscent
of
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
for
a
belgian
and
fizzy
overall
a
drinkable
belgian
pale
ale
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
most
likely
i
am
not
supposed
to
like
beers
from
inbev
a
good
starter
belgium
beer
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
yet
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
good
drinkability
by
belgian
ale
standards
not
overpowering
but
a
very
nice
clean
ale
the
pour
is
a
clear
gold
with
a
rocky
white
head
good
head
retention
finally
fades
to
an
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
clean
with
notes
of
honey
and
slightly
vanilla
the
flavors
are
again
highlighted
with
honey
and
vanilla
there
is
also
a
late
grassy
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
is
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
taste
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
both
good
but
nothing
that
really
stood
out
for
me
overall
maybe
not
the
best
example
that
ive
had
but
a
nice
enjoyable
brew
for
sure
deasy
drinking
nothing
unpleasant
but
lacks
character
especially
for
the
style
i
found
myself
buying
another
pack
of
this
just
to
intoduce
to
my
buddies
because
it
is
a
good
all
around
beer
drinkability
was
outstanding
this
beer
was
sweet
and
flavorful
yet
quite
well
balanced
furthermore
the
alcohol
was
not
at
all
detectable
one
of
the
most
sessionable
belgiums
i
have
had
to
date
d
absolutely
a
very
drinkable
flavorful
beer
leffe
blonde
is
a
good
belgian
pale
abbey
ale
that
doesnt
overwhelm
you
with
complexity
it
pours
clear
and
golden
with
a
medium
head
that
reduces
to
thin
white
covering
the
aroma
is
mostly
clove
and
spice
it
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
with
some
nuttyalmond
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
light
and
nicely
carbonated
the
finish
is
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
but
leaves
a
slightly
metallic
taste
in
your
mouth
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
during
a
meal
and
would
probably
go
well
with
most
pub
fare
this
is
probably
the
easiest
to
drink
belgian
pale
that
ive
had
that
doesnt
skimp
on
flavor
dumb
down
for
the
masses
or
deviate
from
the
style
thoroughly
refreshing
and
it
doesnt
cause
palette
fatigue
unlike
unibroue
products
despite
being
awesome
i
can
only
drink
so
many
highly
recommended
slainte
drinkability
all
day
long
this
is
a
refreshing
tasty
light
beer
i
could
drink
all
afternoon
at
the
ball
game
glad
i
had
two
in
the
fridge
so
i
could
crack
open
a
second
and
continue
the
refreshment
got
these
from
my
brotherinlaw
who
bought
a
taste
of
belgium
12pack
its
the
best
of
the
three
in
the
case
i
think
one
of
my
new
favorite
everyday
beers
golden
color
with
thick
white
head
very
nice
aroma
yeasty
and
spicy
at
first
it
tastes
rather
sweet
but
finishes
a
bit
bitter
and
dry
very
clean
good
strong
yeast
flavors
like
a
hefeweizen
clove
is
prominent
and
some
banana
flavors
also
there
is
also
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
finest
beers
among
those
made
in
high
volumes
d
an
average
pale
ale
i
would
say
sticky
mouthfeel
isnt
pleasant
but
some
nice
notes
in
smell
and
taste
ok
offering
but
stick
with
duvel
for
a
better
widely
available
pale
ale
overall
a
decent
brew
but
too
commercial
its
also
too
sweet
and
syrupy
and
at
times
its
almost
hard
to
drink
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
reasonable
alcohol
content
allows
for
several
samples
it
may
be
chic
to
criticize
macro
brewed
beers
like
leffe
but
its
a
solid
everyday
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
beers
of
belgium
the
taste
is
of
citrus
spices
cloves
followed
up
buy
sugary
sweetness
and
some
hops
a
bit
watery
the
flavors
dont
pop
out
as
much
as
you
might
expect
from
a
belgian
still
its
quite
drinkable
a
decent
belgian
pale
drinkability
is
good
nice
and
tasty
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
lot
of
head
coming
up
but
dissapating
quickly
the
smell
is
quite
strong
and
very
floral
and
sugary
the
taste
is
very
heavy
very
chewy
it
most
certainly
fills
your
mouth
and
seems
like
those
suds
on
the
side
of
your
glass
are
the
same
ones
on
the
side
of
your
mouth
once
you
are
done
drinking
it
obvioisly
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
that
has
simply
been
over
produced
and
is
now
just
average
good
for
one
drink
then
move
on
between
the
high
carbonation
and
the
spicy
corriander
the
mouthfeel
is
not
melow
but
the
refreshing
floral
element
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
beer
to
go
with
seafood
shrimp
scampi
oysters
the
sweet
midpalate
goes
nice
with
anykind
of
butter
sauce
it
is
also
nice
to
be
able
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
belgian
beer
thanks
to
rob
mchugh
for
the
constant
prodding
to
try
this
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
belgian
pale
ale
fruity
dry
and
delicate
as
promised
the
flavors
are
there
they
are
just
a
little
thin
in
comparison
to
other
beers
of
the
style
the
aroma
was
very
faint
i
caught
hints
of
citrus
and
light
malts
but
that
was
about
it
the
taste
was
moderatly
sweet
with
small
hints
of
citrus
ocasionaly
some
bready
flavors
would
cross
my
pallate
the
finish
was
smooth
and
slightly
dry
with
some
hops
to
finish
everything
off
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
ballanced
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
decent
flavord
beer
though
i
feel
that
it
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
an
unfiltered
bottle
conditioned
belgain
pale
ale
the
mouth
is
wellcarbonated
and
rather
complex
but
the
flavors
do
not
seem
to
mesh
all
that
well
i
have
drank
more
than
two
of
these
in
an
evening
but
only
after
being
somewhat
lubricated
by
other
beers
get
my
buzz
onn
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
i
recommend
this
to
everyone
ive
been
to
more
than
a
few
establishments
where
leffe
has
been
the
only
halfdecent
thing
on
tap
and
for
that
i
was
thankful
because
while
its
not
quite
good
enough
to
make
the
shelves
in
my
cellar
its
a
more
than
acceptable
fill
for
my
glass
if
im
out
with
friends
at
a
less
than
craftfriendly
restaurant
which
coincidentally
is
the
only
place
i
ever
drink
it
i
love
this
stuff
its
a
nice
and
smooth
medium
bodied
belgian
pale
with
a
fairly
sweet
and
creamy
taste
it
has
one
of
my
favorite
appearances
out
of
all
the
beers
ive
had
and
it
looks
amazing
in
a
glass
weak
in
terms
of
other
belgians
but
better
then
most
everything
else
gotta
love
it
d
not
terrible
but
not
great
for
the
style
if
you
want
a
sippin
blonde
there
are
more
flavorfulcomplex
blondes
to
choose
from
this
ones
ok
but
is
a
bit
sweet
and
too
fizzy
d
it
was
nice
to
try
but
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
ill
stick
with
the
leffe
brown
sweeter
smoother
and
better
balanced
nonetheless
this
remains
a
sturdy
mediumbodied
brew
with
a
spicy
effervescence
that
quenches
as
well
as
any
american
summer
brew
recommended
d
its
a
good
overall
beer
but
there
are
better
belgian
pale
ales
such
as
duvel
in
spite
of
my
love
for
almost
all
things
belgian
leffe
blonde
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
largely
because
it
uses
a
clove
hammer
of
a
yeast
strain
when
a
finely
honed
yeast
chisel
would
have
worked
better
its
a
testament
to
my
affection
for
the
style
that
i
still
found
something
to
like
in
this
less
than
stellar
version
drinkability
very
drinkable
clean
and
smooth
drinkability
for
me
it
would
be
great
insession
whether
in
bottle
or
ontap
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
keg
from
local
suppliers
however
for
future
beerevents
here
i
know
that
its
served
ontap
in
some
pubs
at
least
one
in
washington
dc
for
instance
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
fairly
subdued
belgian
pale
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
good
golden
ale
with
that
characteristic
belgian
yeastiness
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
d
good
not
outstanding
but
not
offensive
either
easy
drinker
for
a
summer
day
poured
to
a
pale
golden
color
with
foamy
white
head
that
lasted
the
entire
bottle
with
high
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
aroma
was
very
hoppy
and
spicy
mostly
clove
flavor
was
a
continuation
of
the
hops
and
clove
with
some
hint
of
other
spices
and
a
trickle
of
malty
sweetness
aroma
and
flavor
were
consistent
as
the
beer
warmed
and
the
finsih
was
very
good
and
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
blonde
this
beer
falls
into
the
boy
am
i
glad
i
bought
this
category
being
a
bit
of
a
purist
reinheitsgebotist
when
it
comes
to
malt
beverages
i
am
not
a
real
fan
of
belgian
beers
so
when
i
saw
the
display
of
abbey
de
leffe
at
the
local
store
i
was
attracted
first
to
the
amazing
packaging
but
the
ba
reviews
were
good
so
i
tried
it
absolutely
loved
it
rich
clear
golden
color
with
massive
foamy
head
that
lasted
and
lasted
and
then
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
spicy
clovebanana
hops
hits
your
nose
immediately
but
subtlely
and
the
taste
is
reminiscient
of
the
best
belgian
white
beers
but
filtered
to
a
smooth
bubbly
gold
and
not
too
sweet
extremly
drinkable
and
one
of
the
few
ive
enjoyed
right
down
to
the
last
swallow
exceptional
i
think
ill
have
another
d
an
average
beer
a
tasty
if
one
dimensional
belgian
blonde
sweeter
than
most
well
carbonated
pours
bright
golden
with
an
effervescent
white
head
aroma
of
candy
clove
bubblegum
flavor
is
sweet
estery
lacking
a
real
malt
backbone
but
pleasant
enough
not
my
favorite
but
good
for
drinking
if
other
belgians
arent
available
because
of
how
sweet
this
is
i
couldnt
help
but
compare
it
to
white
wine
its
not
the
best
beer
but
id
still
take
it
over
a
white
wine
any
day
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
it
has
a
very
golden
color
with
good
head
and
head
retention
the
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
note
mouthfeel
is
bit
chewy
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
noticeable
id
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
the
dry
light
fruit
flavors
are
crisp
with
a
faint
sweetness
to
give
the
balance
then
they
are
rudely
squashed
by
bitter
hops
the
hops
would
be
fine
if
they
had
some
depth
of
flavor
or
other
characteristic
besides
just
bitterness
upon
tasting
you
are
just
hit
with
all
this
malt
some
wheat
breadiness
and
sweetness
and
this
is
then
ridden
out
on
a
wave
of
alcohol
just
under
the
surface
this
is
a
big
filling
beer
whether
it
looks
that
way
or
not
i
think
that
pairing
it
with
stella
artois
and
hoegarden
in
an
18
pack
does
give
exposure
to
the
nonilluminati
of
beer
however
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
in
its
chalice
or
a
tulip
not
right
out
of
the
bottle
at
a
picnic
the
difference
is
night
and
day
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
a
little
milder
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
this
isnt
bad
there
is
still
plenty
of
flavor
here
to
keep
your
palate
guessing
we
dont
have
access
to
too
many
blond
ales
here
in
texas
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
like
to
drink
again
pretty
drinkable
especially
if
price
is
a
factor
a
6pack
of
these
go
for
about
8
whereas
a
4pack
of
duvel
goes
for
about
9
ive
read
what
people
have
to
say
and
i
do
agree
that
it
is
a
very
commercial
belgian
pale
but
when
you
factor
in
price
its
a
pretty
agreeable
ale
whats
not
to
like
here
ive
read
some
comments
about
leffe
being
nothing
more
than
swill
and
i
wonder
if
people
are
bringing
the
politics
of
its
current
ownershipdistribution
into
the
judgment
of
the
beer
itself
or
maybe
its
popularity
and
accessibility
turns
people
off
for
some
reason
this
is
simply
a
great
beer
nearly
quintessential
when
it
comes
to
defining
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
note
bottled
version
a
bit
more
restrained
in
character
poured
a
sweet
nutty
brown
with
a
great
foamy
head
which
lasted
forever
seemed
like
it
anyway
smells
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
bannana
taste
definitely
proved
my
nose
correct
with
the
bannana
and
fruityness
almost
had
a
hefe
feel
and
taste
to
it
maybe
thats
why
i
liked
it
so
much
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
this
i
am
so
glad
i
had
a
full
liter
of
it
oh
wait
and
i
have
another
thank
god
for
mistakes
drinkability
easy

poured
from
a

nice

torward
the
top
of
the

on

lasted

i
was
done
with

2
oz
bottle
not
long
nice

smooth
and
well
balanced
wonderful
golden
color
easy
to
drink
perfect
summertime
beer
pours
a
really
nice
gold
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
nice
raisin
and
bubblegumesque
scent
which
is
quite
pleasant
taste
is
very
different
it
has
a
bubblegum
type
of
flavor
that
isnt
too
overwhelming
or
overpowering
accompanied
by
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
very
different
than
anything
ive
ever
had
and
is
quite
pleasant
to
drink
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
kill
a
6er
quite
quickly
drinkability
the
sweetness
may
make
this
a
tad
difficult
for
repeat
consumption
in
a
given
day
but
overall
an
easy
going
inoffensive
brew
drinkability
for
me
suffers
from
being
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
this
one
has
nothing
objectionable
about
it
its
widely
available
and
the
bitter
finish
does
help
a
bit
solid
but
i
drank
it
slow
and
didnt
care
to
order
another
since
i
do
not
have
any
type
of
belgian
glass
ware
i
used
an
over
sized
winr
glass
the
color
is
deep
golden
with
a
slight
white
head
forming
the
aroma
starts
off
with
some
scents
of
yeast
then
followed
by
strong
a
citrus
fragrance
the
taste
is
very
sweet
but
mostly
citrus
fruit
flavors
with
a
spicy
ending
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
very
lite
at
first
and
seems
to
get
heavier
as
it
crosses
the
palate
this
an
okay
beer
the
sweetness
would
turn
off
some
but
it
lacks
that
punch
that
belgian
beers
usually
have
in
taste
d
id
say
that
leffe
blonde
has
a
pretty
good
drinkability
i
could
only
really
put
away
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
it
takes
a
while
to
drink
it
because
of
the
intial
biting
taste
of
the
beer
the
aftertaste
is
worth
it
though
the
mild
hops
prevent
the
residual
sugar
from
cloying
and
results
in
a
soft
inviting
finish
cheers
i
most
likely
wont
buy
this
again
it
might
work
for
an
introduction
to
belgians
for
those
who
arent
used
to
strong
beerthats
it
for
a
little
bit
more
i
would
rather
buy
affligem
blonde
but
this
is
worth
a
try
exhibits
soft
round
flavors
great
mouthfeel
thick
and
creamy
flowers
spice
belgian
yeast
lemon
orange
banana
wheat
malt
with
very
little
hops
and
no
noticeable
alcohol
delicious
d
not
too
bad
compares
favorably
to
the
macro
lagers
and
ales
but
i
would
expect
more
from
the
style
poured
a
petrified
sap
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
little
honey
and
lilac
this
filtered
blonde
tastes
very
clean
if
not
a
bit
too
thick
strong
tastes
of
toasted
honey
throughout
with
some
mild
carbonation
at
the
end
to
give
a
tiny
bite
can
be
a
bit
too
sweet
at
times
so
i
think
this
would
be
a
one
and
done
brew
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
want
something
a
little
thicker
mouthfeeldrinkability
fantastically
prickly
just
short
of
being
overdone
it
really
moves
in
the
mouth
and
helps
lift
the
oils
from
the
salmon
off
the
tongue
cleansing
and
rejuvinating
it
withers
towards
the
end
of
the
sampling
a
great
food
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
as
it
is
meant
to
be
truly
enjoyed
m
d
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
on
this
offering
carbonation
concentrates
on
the
tongue
as
the
beer
slicks
down
the
throat
drinkability
is
also
just
alright
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
or
would
have
liked
but
nonetheless
a
good
change
of
pace
and
woth
a
try
quite
an
unique
flavor
to
it
strong
in
yeast
as
well
as
a
honeymolasses
like
flavor
pours
a
rich
golden
color
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbination
overall
a
well
rounded
brew
with
quite
a
lot
to
offer
perhaps
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
normally
like
but
the
powerful
flavor
makes
up
for
it
i
must
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
after
reading
leffe
is
a
commercial
beer
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
smooth
floral
and
refreshing
great
drinkability
and
nice
belgian
yeast
strain
the
head
and
lacing
kept
up
with
duvel
imo
decent
smell
and
sweet
smooth
taste
also
a
slight
hop
kickback
on
the
swill
i
recommend
this
one
and
it
is
very
reasonably
priced
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
was
pleasent
with
light
fruit
and
something
a
little
peppery
also
somewhat
musty
taste
was
interesting
prickly
and
fruity
with
some
clove
and
orange
coriander
tastes
as
well
almost
witbierish
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
on
the
palate
certainly
seems
like
a
beer
that
i
could
have
many
of
in
one
sitting
not
bad
i
liked
it
maybe
not
earth
shattering
but
worth
trying
i
would
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
a
few
more
complexities
pulled
through
towards
the
end
of
my
glass
golden
in
appearance
with
a
white
head
good
carbonation
smells
of
bannana
and
spices
a
wonderfully
rich
taste
with
a
strong
finish
good
lacing
throughout
incredibly
drinkable
im
finding
that
the
belgian
strong
double
ales
are
my
favorite
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
double
and
am
probably
biased
when
it
gomes
to
rating
this
type
of
beer
nice
white
head
with
funky
good
smell
somewhere
between
peach
and
yellow
taste
follows
after
that
funk
funky
enough
to
satisfy
not
so
funky
that
people
not
familiar
with
more
exotic
lambics
etc
wouldnt
enjoy
it
light
to
moderately
carbonated
leffe
blonde
is
a
very
drinkable
belgian
abbey
ale
i
do
prefer
the
slightly
less
potent
and
more
flavorful
leffe
bruin
though
that
i
have
yet
to
find
in
massachusetts
a
while
ago
i
remember
comparing
this
with
the
brown
the
brown
was
more
complex
and
delicious
but
it
is
not
as
easily
attained
around
here
anyway
so
i
do
recommend
this
ale
leffe
available
in
6packs
for
10
is
a
deal
heres
a
fabulously
frothy
bigger
bubbles
belgian
exoriginal
abby
with
the
qualities
that
im
beginning
to
think
are
common
for
a
belgian
double
or
a
french
farmhouse
ale
the
appearance
and
smell
are
delightful
smells
of
fruit
and
spring
like
saison
dupont
but
the
taste
is
heavier
more
malty
and
less
crisp
than
the
smell
would
suggest
its
not
a
hugely
complex
taste
that
many
belgians
have
but
in
a
blind
taste
test
you
could
easily
be
fooled
into
thinking
this
was
a
much
more
expensive
pour
it
drinks
real
easily
at
just
6
6abv
however
so
that
6
pack
may
not
last
too
long
d
really
good
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
because
i
had
seen
in
in
the
best
of
belgium
beer
pack
which
contains
stella
artois
naturally
i
was
skeptical
of
any
beer
that
would
be
cited
as
the
best
alongside
of
stella
leffe
blonde
is
quite
good
though
it
has
a
complex
and
interesting
flavor
it
is
no
trappist
and
it
is
no
duvel
but
it
is
pretty
good
i
didnt
expect
much
and
it
surprised
me
to
say
this
is
the
best
of
belgium
is
nothing
compared
to
the
insult
of
stella
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
some
of
the
warmer
months
coming
on
grab
a
cold
one
and
enjoy
in
the
hammock
forget
who
distributes
this
its
gooddrinkable
and
smooth
yet
hearty
enough
for
its
flavor
to
hold
its
own
while
i
paired
it
with
buffalo
chicken
strips
creamy
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
i
didnt
purchase
this
myself
but
i
put
no
label
on
the
cap
likely
provided
by
trbeer
stupid
me
for
my
lack
of
documentation
whoever
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
with
a
light
yellow
dusting
almost
crystal
clear
with
a
couple
of
particulates
smells
clovey
phenolic
edgy
with
some
fruity
esters
and
malay
sweet
that
rises
on
an
aromatic
tastes

with
a
rough

belgian

character
homey
and
lightly
colored
belgian
candy
sugar
wet
sweet
carries
thoughout
but
seems
lacking
in
some
complexity
dry
finish
and
a
bit
more
sharply
carbonated
that
i
would
have
expected
a
malt
wet
sweet
with
a
yeast
funk
edge
md
body
that
rolls
into
the
mouth
light
carb
is
a
bit
sharper
than
id
like
and
imo
doesnt
mix
with
the
clove
funk
in
a
positive
way
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
bitter
fruits
with
an
interesting
smokey
element
the
flavor
was
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
it
begins
a
bit
watery
then
hits
you
with
sugar
and
a
bit
of
citrus
followed
by
a
slight
alcohol
presence
the
overall
sugary
feel
to
it
doesnt
do
it
for
me
smells
a
bit
musty
sharp
but
light
hops
floral
maybe
a
bit
of
bubblegum
bubblegum
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
with
the
taste
a
bit
sticky
with
syrupy
sweetness
bitter
aftertaste
not
much
hop
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
fizzy
but
overall
ok
admittedly
im
drinking
this
a
bit
warmer
than
normal
sweet
thin
watery
gunk
typically
leffe
yeasts
and
sugars
are
more
pronounced
than
the
barley
or
hops
bleigh
macro
sugar
water
with
a
nice
carbonation
stream
clear
gold
body
with
a
fluffy
light
head
smells
slightly
medicinal
and
almost
fruity
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
in
all
categories
this
clear
light
golden
ale
smells
initially
of
earth
and
grass
with
mild
fruit
entering
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
profile
is
of
gentle
rounded
malt
with
a
slight
mineral
twang
mild
notes
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
play
on
the
medium
finish
sure
it
doesnt
offer
too
much
but
it
doesnt
ask
too
much
either
i
wont
rule
out
buying
this
on
tap
againa
but
i
sure
dont
plan
on
buying
it
in
the
bottle
again
anytime
soon
id
have
to
say
its
okay
nothing
spectacular
it
isnt
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
the
further
down
i
got
in
this
the
less
and
less
i
enjoyed
it
to
the
point
where
i
was
disappointed
i
still
have
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
to
go
overall
an
ok
beer
worth
a
try
leffe
blonde
pours
into
my
leffe
chalice
glass
a
deep
blonde
color
with
large
white
head
of
large
bubbles
left
the
appropriate
and
expected
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
yeasty
and
i
got
a
bit
of
a
soap
smell
as
well
the
aroma
could
have
more
spices
or
something
but
it
was
pretty
much
just
sour
yeast
it
is
much
the
same
on
the
taste
lots
of
yeast
flavors
with
not
alot
of
anything
else
coming
through
dry
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
finish
lots
of
carbonation
so
leaves
a
crisp
tingle
on
the
tongue
above
average
but
lots
of
better
belgians
out
there
i
agree
with
the
other
reviews
that
they
should
not
clean
this
up
so
much
but
its
still
a
very
good
belgian
blonde
pours
a
clear
medium
yellow
with
a
one
finger
yellow
tinged
head
that
is
fairly
thick
and
reasonably
well
retained
but
not
the
sort
of
billowing
lastsforever
cloud
of
foam
that
i
always
hope
for
when
having
a
beer
of
this
style
smells
of
sharp
spices
like
pepper
and
cloves
with
fruity
notes
sweetness
and
an
alcoholic
tone
as
well
tastes
mostly
of
malts
and
snd
spiced
fruits
with
hops
and
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
thick
but
a
bit
too
clean
drinkablilty
is
solid
but
not
particularly
impressive
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
feel
like
theyve
sterilized
it
too
much
and
it
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
poured
this
blond
into
a
0
4
liter
shortstemed
beer
chalice
creamy
offwhite
head
that
has
lots
of
lacing
and
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
a
champ
excellent
bubble
column
rising
up
throught
the
center
of
the
glass
color
is
burnt
golden
the
smell
is
mesquite
honey
and
cloves
with
a
slight
hint
of
eucalyptus
a
great
aromatherapy
beer
taste
is
sweet
fading
to
nutmeg
and
finishing
with
pure
honey
great
texture
attributed
to
micro
carbonation
great
starter
beer
or
reversespacer
beer
in
a
session
this
blondie
drops
the
laundry
im
impressed
this
wouldnt
be
a
terrible
brew
for
a
night
out
but
it
doesnt
have
any
matching
potential
for
food
in
my
opinion
and
there
wasnt
much
about
it
that
stood
out
its
certainly
oldfashioned
and
for
more
modern
tastes
like
mine
this
was
worth
a
try
and
not
much
else
body
is
just
barely
medium
very
slick
and
crisp
with
a
soft
texture
and
light
pinpoint
carbonation
should
rate
higher
imo
i
feel
like
it
should
be
better
than
it
is
i
might
revisit
it
but
this
time
it
ended
up
drinking
like
a
very
bland
beer
poured
a
dark
orange
with
a
nice
puffy
head
smell
is
of
caramel
and
burnt
sugar
taste
is
quite
nice
essence
of
caramel
pears
and
prunes
make
their
way
down
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
delicate
very
smooth
carbonation
is
very
minimal
which
makes
this
ever
so
easy
to
drink
nice
drink
to
relax
with
at
night
after
a
big
meal
this
beer
looked
totally
normal
at
first
golden
color
had
little
head
to
it
and
smelled
kinda
sweet
to
my
surprise
when
i
drank
it
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
period
maybe
it
is
just
me
i
dont
like
sweet
beer
but
this
was
terrible
i
did
not
take
a
mouthful
or
drink
more
than
first
touched
my
tounge
on
first
sip
not
for
those
who
dont
like
sweet
beer
bad
bad
bad
nice
light
fluffy
head
appears
with
the
pour
very
clear
sweet
smell
emanates
from
the
glass
sort
pear
like
i
think
this
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
well
balanced
with
fuit
and
a
candylike
presence
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
its
not
a
rich
beer
by
any
means
but
stands
up
to
spicey
food
or
can
be
had
nicely
on
its
own
d
great
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
and
look
forward
to
more
not
too
terrible
considering
the
giant
conglomerate
that
brews
it
but
far
from
the
best
belgian
abbeystyle
ale
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
if
the
price
was
right
and
if
i
could
get
it
locally
i
would
buy
more
as
it
sits
now
there
are
better
beers
similar
to
this
i
can
get
so
be
it
i
am
very
happy
i
tried
my
first
leffe
beer
it
wasnt
shit
in
a
bottle
sure
it
is
clean
it
is
an
industrialized
belgian
beer
maybe
it
was
great
once
now
it
is
decent
thank
you
red
haze
this
was
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
drinkabilityoverall
easy
enough
to
drink
and
a
beautiful
brew
borderline
my
favourite
from
leffe
a
great
fruit
dark
tasting
contrast
with
a
refreshing
crisp
pale
ale
well
balanced
this
clear
orange
golden
ale
is
sweet
scents
of
sweet
fruit
oranges
and
peaches
with
just
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
in
the
background
lead
into
a
sweet
malty
flavor
honeyed
fruit
with
a
full
mouth
feel
make
this
drink
a
pleasure
to
drink
probably
not
the
best
abbey
ale
out
there
but
better
then
most
ive
tried
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
gladly
serve
this
to
folks
that
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
belgian
beer
i
think
i
could
call
this
a
gateway
belgian
for
the
uninitiated
overall
the
hops
were
too
dry
and
harsh
different
from
strong
and
overall
this
drink
lacked
in
balance
tried
this
on
tap
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
taste
is
a
pretty
strong
sweet
fruity
taste
which
is
balanced
out
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
this
is
a
pretty
strong
tasting
brew
with
the
sweetness
overpowering
the
hops
a
good
bit
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
a
relatively
clear
goldenyellow
colored
beer
with
loads
of
foam
that
seems
to
sit
stationary
for
some
time
leaving
behind
some
nice
lacing
aromas
of
grains
yeast
and
apricots
seem
to
dominate
the
taste
is
typical
of
this
style
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
that
is
complemented
by
sweet
fruity
flavors
my
biggest
problem
with
this
brew
is
its
unusual
aftertaste
that
just
lingers
on
and
on
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
like
swallowing
a
slightly
stale
loaf
of
bread
just
not
very
appealing
the
drinkability
takes
a
hit
because
of
this
as
well
i
would
rather
follow
this
beer
with
a
glass
of
water
than
to
have
another
one
leffe
is
quite
a
good
introduction
to
the
belgian
style
i
think
a
very
sweet
brew
but
as
ones
tastes
become
a
bit
more
refined
the
beer
becomes
altogether
unnecessary
it
is
very
syrupy
almost
tastes
like
robitussin
not
that
it
is
all
bad
i
myself
love
tussin
anyway
an
adequate
beer
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
go
out
and
purchase
very
fruity
and
way
too
thick
for
the
style
i
would
like
something
a
bit
more
summery
not
that
that
is
really
a
word
with
any
meaning
but
anyway
in
any
case
i
guess
it
was
a
nice
surprise
a
bar
so
that
i
didnt
have
to
order
a
guiness
but
there
are
definitely
better
things
out
there
for
the
price
from
a
33
cl
bottle
dated
best
before
19906
leffe
blonde
delivers
a
light
crisp
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
from
a
bright
golden
body
the
flavor
is
equally
crisp
and
slightly
tart
with
a
light
touch
of
pepper
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
this
is
a
fairly
standard
belgian
pale
but
its
a
high
standard
its
authenticity
as
an
abbey
ale
however
is
stifled
by
its
contracted
interbrew
origins
12oz
bottle
pours
a
perfect
copper
color
and
makes
a
thin
white
head
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
on
my
glass
strong
bread
yeasty
aroma
peppery
spices
clove
and
sweet
banana
are
dominant
in
the
flavor
however
theres
a
bit
of
metallic
in
the
background
that
is
not
so
pleasant
and
perhaps
a
bit
plastic
nice
medium
palate
that
finishes
dry
with
crisp
bubbly
carbonation
halfway
through
this
and
the
metallic
flavor
has
seemingly
diminished
quite
a
bit
though
the
plastic
remains
while
this
brew
has
a
couple
of
strong
points
the
weak
points
are
dominating
here
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
one
again
for
a
while
one
thing
i
noticed
here
is
that
this
brew
isnt
bottle
conditioned
which
seems
to
be
pretty
standard
for
the
style
perhaps
leffes
commercial
nature
will
inspire
some
macro
drinkers
to
crossover
into
the
craftbrew
world
but
i
cant
say
that
i
recommend
this
a
decent
gateway
beer
at
best
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
harsh
though
not
oppressive
decent
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
to
be
quite
acceptable
and
i
would
have
again
thought
i
prefer
the
leffe
brune
and
the
radieuse
the
blonde
is
more
like
a
little
brother
bright
golden
hue
good
head
that
lasts
moderately
full
bodied
mild
bitterness
aromas
show
sweet
pale
malt
accents
rich
and
chewy
on
the
palate
showing
good
malt
intensity
and
sweetness
that
is
balanced
and
a
dry
hop
finish
shows
a
very
drinkable
character
impressively
flavorful
d
an
average
belgian
blondnothing
more
nothing
less
not
the
best
belgian
out
there
but
a
decent
value
for
the
price
a
good
gateway
belgian
perhaps
sacrifices
some
flavor
for
drinkability
hence
no
4s
other
than
appearance
this
would
however
be
a
good
pick
to
ease
someone
into
the
style
the
clerk
at
my
local
gourmet
beer
store
warned
me
that
this
brew
was
very
spicy
in
fact
too
spicy
for
him
but
for
a
girlygirl
like
me
i
thought
it
was
perfect
i
had
one
and
then
two
and
was
good
and
spiced
up
for
the
night
i
havent
had
much
of
this
particular
style
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
good
one
of
its
kind
get
in
touch
with
your
feminine
spicy
side
and
enjoy
this
beer
is
full
bodied
and
seems
to
me
to
have
more
carbonation
than
most
beers
but
i
think
that
this
feature
compliments
the
taste
of
this
beer
as
to
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
find
nothing
special
about
it
except
for
its
unique
taste
but
i
am
sure
that
there
are
many
beers
out
there
that
represent
this
style
much
better
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
big
fluffy
white
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
malt
spices
some
hops
coriander
and
orange
peel
taste
is
really
sweet
some
spice
coriander
and
orange
and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
not
bad
better
than
the
brune
but
the
sweetness
is
pretty
cloying
overall
a
very
decent
brew
leffe
is
has
a
quintessential
golden
color
with
high
carbonation
and
an
usually
long
lasting
head
its
head
is
quite
unusual
and
makes
this
beer
worth
trying
by
itself
rich
long
lasting
taste
but
without
a
bad
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
aroma
very
drinkable
and
always
a
terrific
beer
to
rediscover
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
massive
white
chunky
head
smell
is
herbal
spicy
very
nice
taste
is
spicy
bananalike
and
initially
enjoyable
but
also
very
subtle
almost
as
if
it
has
been
watereddown
finish
is
light
and
nice
but
not
quite
what
i
was
looking
for
almost
too
easy
to
drink
i
would
describe
this
as
a
macro
belgian
pale
ale
it
seems
as
if
inbev
has
turned
this
beer
into
the
the
bub
light
of
belgian
pale
ales
what
will
be
next
maybe
they
will
buy
an
abbey
11009
the
sweetness
level
and
a
lack
of
complexity
hamper
drinkability
needs
about
half
the
sugar
and
extra
spice
flavors
notes
just
average
drinkable
but
not
something
ill
return
to
seems
plentiful
in
pensacola
though
drinkability
this
is
an
very
good
tasting
beer
i
could
sip
my
way
through
a
few
of
these
d
the
improved
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
of
the
tap
version
of
this
beer
naturally
improves
its
drinkability
as
well
a
marked
difference
from
the
bottle
overall
leffe
blonde
was
too
slickly
sweet
to
be
a
really
enjoyable
brew
maybe
more
of
a
throwback
to
what
earlier
belgian
pale
ales
were
like
but
it
cant
compete
with
todays
spicier
offerings
it
had
been
over
three
years
since
i
last
had
this
beer
and
i
didnt
have
fond
memories
how
things
have
changed
including
my
luck
im
guessing
pours
medium
to
light
amber
not
much
fogginess
with
a
semidense
thick
white
head
that
faded
slowly
and
laced
well
the
nose
was
rather
unremarkable
with
some
acidity
and
citrus
and
something
i
can
only
describe
as
warm
coming
through
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
chewiness
on
the
tongue
makes
way
for
spice
with
bread
good
carbonation
feel
leaves
a
distinct
but
light
enough
hoppiness
on
the
finish
feels
good
drinks
well
either
ive
changed
a
lot
or
i
got
a
better
set
of
bottles
notes
for
the
price
1
80
not
bad
but
i
can
find
excellent
examples
of
belgian
ales
easily
so
why
try
this
twice
came
to
me
as
a
copper
hued
beer
atop
which
rested
a
one
finger
head
no
carbonation
was
seen
but
pleasant
rings
of
lacing
were
left
as
the
beer
went
down
aroma
of
light
malt
taste
was
light
with
a
bubble
gum
quality
to
it
light
malt
shows
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
was
tingly
while
this
isnt
the
best
belgian
beer
in
the
world
it
was
perfect
for
the
summery
day
i
sampled
it
on
id
drink
it
again
good
price
for
an
excellent
belgian
it
may
not
be
my
favorite
in
this
style
but
it
is
a
style
i
love
so
ill
keep
coming
back
this
isnt
my
typical
type
of
beer
but
its
really
interesting
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
everynight
or
in
a
session
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
could
see
drinking
all
the
time
as
it
could
become
cloying
real
quick
overallthis
belgian
is
really
filtered
which
is
a
shame
because
it
seems
like
beneath
this
filtering
there
is
a
monster
waiting
to
come
out
a
shame
its
full
potential
wasnt
reached
whopping
head
with
massive
fizzy
big
carbonation
and
a
perfectly
clear
view
right
through
the
body
thats
where
i
have
a
problem
is
the
ultra
clear
super
filtered
appearance
and
it
truly
translated
into
a
beer
without
character
candy
like
smell
and
the
usual
belgian
yeast
coming
through
i
had
many
beers
this
day
and
this
was
the
worst
of
the
bunch
i
had
this
beer
second
before
the
next
three
which
were
all
grand
crus
so
this
is
not
a
victim
of
circumstance
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ales
to
put
it
nicely
and
i
would
recommend
you
skip
this
pup
ive
had
a
lot
of
enjoyment
with
this
beer
and
id
definitely
recommend
it
especially
for
fans
of
belgian
ales
at
6
6
abv
this
will
hurt
you
but
it
is
so
smooth
and
drinkable
i
bet
you
cant
drink
just
one
offered
to
friends
who
requested
bud
light
some
returned
to
me
to
finish
myself
and
some
drank
it
out
of
politeness
however
none
of
them
had
any
complaints
about
the
keg
of
milwaukees
best
picked
up
a
six
pack
from
trader
joes
in
the
dc
area
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
amber
and
clear
first
thing
i
noticed
was
a
very
intense
spiciness
but
not
too
overpowering
and
somewhat
inviting
spicy
taste
throughout
and
had
almost
a
dry
feel
in
the
mouth
very
palatable
and
a
good
brew
for
the
summer
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
purchase
again
particularly
during
the
summer
as
a
nice
thirst
quencher
a
solid
beer
that
melds
very
nicely
with
food
especially
salty
foods
like
yakitori
the
real
selling
point
for
me
though
is
the
taste
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
without
being
cloying
like
the
color
the
taste
is
a
bit
honeyish
with
a
quality
aftertaste
and
it
goes
down
easy
perhaps
too
easy
as
it
would
be
entirely
too
easy
to
drink
a
few
too
many
of
these
overall
a
very
palatable
beer
that
i
would
pay
to
drink
again
and
one
of
the
better
belgian
blondes
ive
tried
i
have
been
enjoying
leffe
blonde
for
awhile
i
first
discovered
it
while
pub
hopping
in
london
last
year
it
was
different
from
the
other
great
english
draft
ales
that
i
had
been
drinking
back
in
the
usa
i
noticed
that
it
was
available
at
taco
mac
in
atlanta
fortunately
i
had
to
return
to
europe
on
business
this
spring
and
got
to
drink
leffe
blonde
at
heathrow
airport
amsterdam
and
best
of
all
in
brugges
belgium
there
is
an
irish
pub
next
to
the
crown
plaza
there
that
had
leffe
blonde
on
tap
and
it
was
truly
excellent
my
associates
and
i
sampled
many
different
trappist
ales
while
in
belgium
but
leffe
blonde
was
available
in
most
bars
and
we
loved
it
some
people
are
voicing
negative
opinions
about
this
beer
because
it
is
now
being
distributed
internationally
by
a
large
cartel
if
that
enables
me
to
enjoy
it
more
often
in
atlanta
then
i
cant
view
that
as
a
bad
thing
try
leffe
brunits
even
better
impression
a
delicate
yet
bold
beer
nicely
complex
in
its
flavors
and
power
itll
sneak
up
on
you
i
do
recommend
this
beer
i
always
have
at
least
one
in
my
fridge
even
better
on
tap
purchased
at
lcbo
in
sarnia
ontario
pours
a
copper
hue
with
a
full
yellowish
head
carbonation
is
low
and
nose
produces
yeasty
and
sugary
sweet
flavor
is
slight
fruity
but
big
honey
like
body
is
full
and
syrupy
and
comes
in
after
the
tide
of
honey
aftertaste
is
long
overall
a
tasty
beer
just
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
id
call
it
a
hefe
weizen
made
with
a
belgian
type
yeast
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
beer
but
honestly
doesnt
hold
a
candle
compared
to
what
else
is
coming
out
of
belgium
a
bit
too
expensive
for
whats
inside
the
bottle
in
mu
opinion
bottle
served
at
a
restaurant
in
refrigerated
and
completely
inappropriate
glassware
as
it
was
my
first
belgian
pale
ale
of
the
nonheavy
variety
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
poured
sparkling
clear
golden
colour
with
two
fingers
of
bubbly
head
that
lasted
well
and
left
heaps
of
lacing
when
i
smelt
it
i
thought
there
had
been
some
sort
of
labelling
error
as
it
smelt
just
like
a
german
kristallweizen
all
bananas
and
cloves
same
with
the
taste
what
the
only
difference
was
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
heavier
than
the
average
kristall
will
definitely
come
back
and
rerate
this
after
more
experience
with
the
style
the
beer
of
choice
on
my
recent
carribean
vacation
as
it
was
readily
available
in
cases
at
the
local
grocery
store
this
is
a
nice
beer
at
6
6
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
full
flavor
but
not
to
big
or
complex
for
sitting
around
the
pool
i
will
probably
have
at
least
3
cases
of
this
stuff
while
on
vacation
10
days
in
the
carribean
sun
will
make
you
thirsty
so
i
sould
know
this
beer
back
and
fourth
by
the
time
i
get
home
all
in
all
a
good
beer
nice
flavors
sweetness
up
front
slightly
malty
with
a
nice
tang
definetly
a
good
choice
for
a
nice
session
pleasing
golden
color
not
quite
consistent
with
blonde
nomenclature
large
full
head
with
good
staying
power
the
smell
was
a
pleasing
combo
of
yeast
with
some
fruitiness
very
good
taste
with
almost
no
bitterness
it
hides
the
high
abv
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
almost
syrupy
but
the
ample
carbonation
keeps
things
from
sticking
to
the
palate
for
too
long
quite
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
and
heavy
for
a
marathon
drinking
session
certainly
a
fine
belgian
but
lacking
some
of
the
depth
ive
come
to
expect
from
other
interpretations
of
the
style
330
ml
brown
bottle
best
before
date
on
rear
label
pours
a
translucent
gold
color
with
a
tremendous
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
and
taste
are
about
as
traditional
as
you
can
get
for
a
blonde
there
is
not
much
variation
between
this
and
the
bigger
brands
like
hoegaarden
the
citrus
and
light
hops
taste
is
verbatim
great
for
anyone
who
is
just
getting
into
whites
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
id
seek
out
bought
it
in
a
six
pack
i
like
this
beer
drinkability
notes
tingly
mouthfeel
that
was
as
drinkable
as
a
carbonated
drink
finishes
more
sweet
than
i
think
it
really
should
one
was
enough
for
me
especially
at
this
place
where
there
are
over
sixty
beers
on
tap
to
try
next
leffe
blond
has
a
wellbalanced
malt
flavouring
worthy
of
any
beer
drinker
the
aroma
brings
me
back
to
something
in
my
childhood
but
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
cheers
wasnt
very
carbonated
so
it
had
a
good
mouthfeel
however
because
of
the
sweetness
too
forever
to
drink
this
beer
has
crossover
potential
i
will
say
that
id
probably
head
straight
for
the
witbiers
if
im
looking
for
something
with
a
similar
flavor
however
with
a
prominent
yet
lite
malt
aroma
some
phenols
present
low
hop
aroma
poured
out
golden
nice
head
retention
moderate
carbonation
sweet
malt
flavor
with
hint
of
spice
maybe
honey
also
slight
fruit
breaks
thru
when
it
warms
up
alittle
with
medium
body
smooth
quality
overall
impression
copper
color
some
malt
sweetness
slight
spicy
and
some
fruit
accent
a
drinkable
beer
to
say
the
least
nice
to
have
when
relaxing
warming
up
to
do
some
beer
reviews
about
two
summers
ago
i
went
to
a
show
at
the
pnc
bank
arts
center
in
holmdel
nj
and
there
was
a
premiumimported
beer
vendor
there
his
laughable
choices
included
rolling
rock
heineken
corona
and
this
beer
it
struck
me
as
somewhat
odd
that
this
beer
was
included
with
the
others
this
is
far
superior
to
those
listed
but
as
a
belgian
ale
it
was
more
watery
and
not
as
bold
as
i
anticipated
i
guess
this
is
a
good
beer
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
wide
world
of
belgians
but
those
with
more
experienced
palettes
will
probably
want
to
pass
poured
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
slight
haze
aroma
was
spicy
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
now
for
the
taste
very
smooth
with
a
good
mouthfeel
the
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
dance
nicely
on
my
tongue
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
honey
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
and
some
spiciness
and
very
slight
sour
yeast
flavor
to
help
to
balance
all
that
sweetness
another
few
sips
and
a
little
fruit
comes
through
mild
fruits
like
pears
and
apples
maybe
raisins
the
overly
sweet
character
begins
to
fade
as
i
drink
more
becomes
a
more
drinkable
enjoyable
offering
as
i
continue
pours
a
clear
goldenlight
amber
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
light
malts
and
a
bit
of
tobacco
and
some
other
weak
esters
taste
is
about
as
weak
as
the
aroma
a
healthy
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
spicy
astringency
towards
the
end
but
nothing
to
rave
about
its
drinkable
but
there
are
certainly
better
belgian
blonde
ales
to
be
had
ill
bet
this
beer
was
wonderful
some
ages
in
the
past
now
it
seems
like
a
very
typical
massmarketed
product
and
it
shows
in
its
quality
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
could
be
done
better
pours
a
dark
clear
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
that
laces
very
well
pretty
much
coating
the
glass
and
has
a
variable
appearance
which
i
like
aroma
was
a
touch
of
alcohol
with
a
strong
smell
that
is
almost
the
spiciness
of
root
beer
taste
is
light
fruits
and
hops
with
less
alcohol
than
expected
from
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
with
a
snap
of
crispness
from
the
hops
i
like
the
blond
but
i
prefer
the
brun
this
one
took
me
by
surprize
an
outstanding
and
enjoyable
beer
i
would
think
a
great
one
to
introduce
belgian
styles
the
pour
reveals
a
deep
gold
beer
with
a
copious
ivory
head
that
recedes
quickly
it
leaves
lots
of
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
of
perfumey
belgian
malts
and
sugars
quite
sweet
really
there
a
subtle
spicyness
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
flawed
it
starts
of
quite
well
with
a
passable
malt
presence
and
good
spiceyness
then
a
metallic
saccarine
sweetness
emerges
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
ruined
by
the
sweetness
it
leaves
a
chemically
aftertaste
thats
not
pleasant
at
all
ive
experienced
this
with
other
bottles
as
well
this
is
definitely
a
beer
im
staying
away
from
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favourite
belgian
styles
my
first
experience
with
an
abbey
beer
overall
quite
positive
i
would
pick
up
the
odd
bottle
of
this
im
now
inclined
to
try
the
brune
a
nice
wellbalanced
beer
leffe
blond
when
poured
into
a
glass
was
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
but
not
much
lace
when
tasting
the
flavor
had
a
mild
fruity
sweetness
but
also
tart
as
to
balance
this
belgium
ale
as
the
bottle
said
leffe
blonde
is
a
fullbodied
deep
golden
beer
that
is
surprisingly
subtle
and
delicate
skein
of
clinging
head
to
start
crystal
clear
pale
gold
hue
with
a
lazy
action
throughout
pungent
pear
and
cidery
initial
aroma
followed
by
a
sticky
sinewy
creamlike
herbal
presence
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
though
clearly
understated
cloves
are
the
first
thing
on
the
tongue
with
some
tangy
white
pepper
bite
and
some
hot
dashi
oddly
alluring
velvetiness
to
mouth
and
eminently
consumable
lacks
some
personality
a
very
nice
brew
overall
fruity
and
spicy
maybe
a
little
too
sugary
tasty
and
very
drinkable
at
6
6
abv
the
beer
poured
a
pale
hazy
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
head
the
nose
is
full
on
orange
almost
like
a
belgian
wheat
beer
not
a
blonde
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
creamyness
thrown
in
with
the
orange
the
feel
is
rather
thick
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
sweet
smooth
beer
pale
gold
with
a
big
fluffy
head
this
was
one
of
my
first
belgian
beers
way
back
and
i
must
say
that
it
suffers
in
comparison
to
the
beers
i
have
tasted
since
then
there
is
a
sweetness
that
is
followed
by
a
coarseness
that
shows
a
lack
of
real
craft
it
is
not
bad
but
doesnt
really
stand
up
as
a
good
example
of
the
style
low
on
dough
and
jonesing
for
a
belgian
this
is
not
a
bad
choice
not
the
best
but
still
a
good
buy
as
they
say
great
starter
beer
for
the
nonbeer
drinkers
of
the
world
what
a
great
beer
for
people
who
have
only
slugged
away
on
white
wines
its
a
great
beer
to
draw
the
wine
snobs
closer
to
the
light
no
doubt
a
solid
beer
but
still
a
bit
underwhelming
from
something
i
expected
to
be
more
memorable
pours
out
a
honey
blonde
into
a
chalice
glass
nice
carbonation
with
a
34
inch
head
that
clings
to
life
quite
well
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
in
the
mix
taste
is
pleasant
but
nothing
impressive
a
bit
of
tartness
in
there
that
didnt
quite
seem
to
fit
a
fine
brew
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
aromas
are
dominated
by
a
candied
sugar
sweetness
thin
layer
of
fruit
as
well
flavor
is
dull
way
too
sweet
nothing
suceeds
in
balacing
this
theres
some
spicy
and
bitter
notes
that
attempt
to
peak
through
finish
is
watery
and
uninspiring
lowmedium
body
it
poured
a
spectacular
clear
orange
gold
and
developed
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
spice
and
fruit
the
taste
is
bold
and
full
of
flavors
there
are
several
spices
and
fruits
competing
for
room
here
its
a
great
blend
and
the
flavor
filled
out
as
the
beer
warmed
a
good
solid
medium
feel
to
this
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
i
think
there
was
a
little
hops
but
no
more
than
just
enough
to
keep
this
from
being
too
sweet
no
bitterness
at
all
this
one
definately
goes
on
the
regular
list
bisciuty
toasted
and
caramel
malt
with
notes
of
melon
herbs
and
other
fruits
alright
ill
face
the
facts
i
know
this
is
a
adjunct
infested
belgian
macro
screwed
up
by
interbrew
but
ya
know
what
it
still
tastes
pretty
good
leffe
blonde
looks
more
darkish
brown
and
slight
red
than
blonde
extremely
clear
with
phenomenal
styrofoamwhite
largebubble
head
that
bubbles
like
soap
lather
and
sticks
stubbornly
to
the
glass
like
thick
plaster
the
reason
i
enjoy
the
appearance
so
much
is
because
of
the
hue
of
the
liquid
itself
rich
and
darker
than
many
others
though
the
smell
is
excellent
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
or
perhaps
i
was
anticipating
more
yeast
there
is
definite
musky
yeast
with
the
malt
extraordinarily
well
balanced
with
it
nuttiness
in
the
smell
along
with
apples
and
peaches
the
aroma
could
have
more
complexity
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
i
e
it
does
not
rely
solely
on
yeast
it
is
much
the
same
on
the
taste
you
can
sense
the
malt
very
well
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
even
some
hop
in
the
finish
of
course
the
yeast
still
is
the
dominant
force
in
the
flavour
giving
phenolic
tastes
and
dry
dusty
fruits
there
are
indeed
grassy
hop
feels
on
the
finish
very
dry
aftertaste
gaseous
carbonation
burning
on
the
tongue
very
akin
to
many
other
belgians
and
perhaps
not
so
good
as
some
this
is
not
the
most
complex
belgian
beer
i
have
tried
but
it
still
tastes
so
much
better
than
the
best
of
some
countries
it
does
not
excel
only
when
placed
next
to
its
countrys
own
beers
and
it
still
is
one
of
the
better
beers
out
there
in
its
own
standard
my
local
store
has
a
mix
a
six
thing
so
i
tried
this
out
not
too
bad
for
a
belgian
blonde
the
head
settled
fast
on
a
light
amber
body
smells
pleasant
like
most
belgian
pale
ales
this
tastes
very
malty
with
some
fruity
hints
not
too
much
hops
goin
on
here
very
sweet
i
find
this
very
drinkable
as
it
goes
down
very
smooth
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
a
light
belgian
brew
clear
amber
with
a
huge
white
head
smells
of
banana
and
clove
dominate
obviously
sweet
taste
very
sweet
some
malt
has
some
dryness
on
the
finish
but
no
real
hops
or
bitterness
present
mouthfeel
is
good
but
almost
buttery
or
sticky
reasonably
good
drinkability
no
real
taste
of
alcohol
but
too
sweet
for
me
and
not
worth
the
effort
of
having
more
than
one
beer
is
good
happy
belgian
beering
drinkability
i
only
bought
a
single
so
i
cant
say
for
sure
however
i
think
that
this
beer
is
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
interesting
beer
although
i
believe
there
are
some
better
belgian
whites
out
there
for
the
lovers
of
this
style
prefer
the
tap
to
bottle
as
it
feels
less
hot
and
more
blalanced
i
actually
like
this
a
lot
better
than
most
people
seem
to
it
pours
a
really
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
smallish
head
there
was
tremendous
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
had
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
the
fruitiness
of
currants
the
taste
is
sweetish
but
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
the
flavor
is
enough
to
cause
you
to
pause
when
you
first
drink
a
sip
and
look
at
the
beer
it
has
more
flavor
than
you
think
it
should
it
is
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
goes
down
really
easily
and
the
second
is
better
than
the
first
very
drinkable
taste
immediately
in
the
mouth
its
largely
light
carbonation
and
sweet
malts
with
an
occasional
citrus
burst
most
of
the
flavor
came
out
in
the
palate
of
the
aftertaste
which
was
dominated
by
muted
roasted
grains
creamy
roasted
corn
with
notes
of
wintergreen
hop
dryness
persists
balancedand
smoothfor
its
almost
7
abv
i
thought
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
pours
a
beautiful
deep
golden
color
without
much
head
but
head
isnt
really
all
that
important
most
of
the
time
nice
faint
honey
scent
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
honey
overtones
almost
like
a
mead
just
enough
bitterness
to
finish
clean
very
tasty
brew
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
its
6
6
abv
500
ml
can
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
is
a
pretty
good
abbaye
style
ale
despite
it
being
fairly
mass
produced
by
interbrew
it
pours
arich
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
fairly
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
bit
sweet
and
bready
and
fruity
somewhat
remenicent
of
a
tripel
taste
is
sweet
and
a
little
fruity
with
bananas
and
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
i
really
detected
no
difference
between
the
can
and
tap
versions
i
dont
know
if
that
is
a
good
or
bad
thing
on
tap
which
was
a
nice
change
poured
light
and
golden
clear
disappointing
brew
tasted
fairly
watery
thought
it
might
have
been
just
me
but
after
reading
some
other
reviews
i
see
im
not
alone
did
have
some
tasty
yeasyness
to
it
also
detected
some
bubblegummy
belgian
type
flavors
but
overall
lacked
body
flavor
and
character
middle
of
the
road
belgian
good
to
try
on
belgian
newbies
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
kind
of
had
a
dark
beer
feel
to
it
but
was
a
blonde
on
the
outside
the
head
was
quite
amazing
it
was
a
pillowy
creamy
white
and
it
did
last
for
quite
sometime
the
smells
given
off
were
grainy
malty
a
little
fruity
a
hint
of
some
hoppage
and
a
smokey
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
different
in
that
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
smokiness
to
it
with
a
tinge
of
fruit
and
alcohol
in
it
i
thought
this
beer
was
fairly
decent
now
i
just
have
to
find
the
other
leffe
brews
this
was
the
first
belgian
beer
i
ever
had
about
2
years
ago
at
the
time
it
was
the
highest
abv
beer
i
think
i
had
ever
tried
oh
how
times
have
changed
i
saw
a
single
available
today
so
i
tried
one
again
leading
into
a
750
of
the
far
superior
allagash
tripel
overall
leffe
is
a
nice
beer
relatively
fullbodied
nice
taste
and
aroma
only
is
diminished
by
the
competition
as
it
is
a
quality
ale
sweeter
as
it
warms
and
a
bit
more
watery
than
the
best
of
the
style
nonetheless
a
few
of
these
would
never
be
a
bad
thing
even
mediocre
belgian
beer
is
good
what
a
country
leffe
blonde
wonderfully
complements
a
quiet
evening
of
reading
or
music
listening
basically
a
simple
very
well
done
belgian
blonde
a
perfect
belgian
session
beer
and
an
asskicker
all
in
one
great
beer
drinkability
easy
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
this
was
one
of
my
first
brews
i
tried
on
tap
in
belgium
last
year
when
i
first
hit
brugges
when
i
knew
nothing
of
the
world
of
belgium
beer
at
the
time
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
i
still
enjoy
it
but
have
grown
to
appreciate
others
a
little
more
not
awful
but
filtered
beyond
reason
not
a
patch
on
an
abbey
pale
or
duvel
or
any
good
tripel
full
bodied
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
very
light
carbonation
a
moderately
complex
taste
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
prefer
the
bottle
and
my
advice
is
to
let
it
come
to
just
below
room
temperature
to
let
the
sweetness
fade
and
more
flavors
to
come
through
this
was
much
criper
and
fleeting
than
i
had
expected
the
flavor
is
sublimely
subtle
and
smooth
i
also
didnt
feel
this
was
as
complex
as
it
is
subtle
and
fleeting
balanced
toward
the
malt
and
driven
by
a
pear
flavor
it
dries
crisply
on
the
tongue
then
evens
out
to
a
lingering
not
unlike
a
ripe
pear
again
a
compliment
to
the
herbal
notes
would
center
on
what
i
feel
is
corriander
in
the
end
i
confess
i
felt
it
was
a
tad
dull
but
made
for
super
drinking
for
any
guests
and
were
quite
drinkable
since
i
got
a
few
the
first
time
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
golden
color
with
a
massive
large
bubbled
white
head
the
smell
is
rather
faint
but
reveals
light
fruit
and
yeast
the
taste
is
much
more
pronounced
with
a
semisweet
fruit
spices
yeast
and
a
warming
alcohol
that
is
blended
nicely
the
hops
are
nearly
hidden
as
you
catch
maybe
what
you
think
are
hops
along
with
the
subtle
carbonation
in
this
one
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
light
stickiness
and
finishes
slightly
sweet
i
could
stand
to
have
this
one
again
op
uw
gezonheid
light
body
coating
from
the
sweetness
if
i
could
have
this
on
tap
somewhere
i
think
id
like
it
better
for
my
money
i
think
ill
try
to
find
another
bottled
belgian
pale
ale
light
bodied
beer
carbonation
levels
slightly
stronger
than
expected
but
produced
a
nice
crispness
on
the
tongue
relatively
clean
aftertaste
very
drinkable
and
this
was
better
on
tap
than
what
i
have
had
in
bottle
beef
notes
many
have
knocked
it
but
you
can
sign
me
up
its
my
belgian
budweiser
im
getting
a
vision
of
me
paying
8
50
for
a
sixer
in
the
near
future
overall
it
is
a
good
brew
nothing
special
to
write
about
but
it
is
and
was
worth
the
try
after
drinking
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
ok
appearance
looked
pretty
nice
nice
clear
light
gold
color
to
it
smell
consisted
of
some
malts
but
thats
it
there
really
wasnt
anything
to
smell
seems
a
little
too
clean
taste
was
also
clean
with
some
spiciness
towards
the
end
nothing
really
exciting
here
if
you
want
a
belgain
pale
ale
go
get
a
duvel
not
as
good
as
the
ontap
version
but
still
a
solid
lowend
belgian
beer
along
wkronenbourg
leffe
blonde
is
available
at
nearly
every
bar
café
and
restaurant
in
my
area
and
while
it
costs
the
same
as
kronenbourg
its
certainly
the
better
of
the
two
nice
beer
for
a
night
out
your
first
impression
of
the
taste
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
and
not
malty
sweet
like
sugary
sweet
i
dont
know
if
they
use
lots
of
cane
sugar
in
the
brewing
process
but
whatever
it
is
it
is
overdone
for
the
first
time
in
any
of
my
reviews
i
will
use
the
adjective
cloying
to
describe
it
once
the
wave
of
sweetness
passes
you
get
some
grapefruity
citrus
and
the
peppery
spice
some
rounded
alcohol
flavors
and
hints
of
honey
this
is
a
bold
tasting
beer
it
definitely
asserts
itself
on
your
palette
and
is
sticky
in
the
finish
problem
is
its
way
too
sweet
and
not
nearly
complex
enough
to
pull
it
off
i
seem
to
remember
having
better
impressions
of
the
bruin
in
the
past
but
ill
take
a
miss
on
the
blonde
next
time
sweet
and
flowery
nose
orange
and
mild
cloves
nothing
that
really
grabs
at
me
or
that
i
find
particularly
interesting
no
distinctive
malt
or
hop
smooth
and
a
bit
peppery
really
middleoftheroad
across
the
board
better
than
macro
pap
for
sure
serve
with
corn
on
the
cob
or
actually
why
bother
serving
decent
maybe
sort
of
the
yeast
is
there
and
sticking
in
the
retaining
head
orangy
and
cloves
are
for
teas
not
beer
bit
well
manged
ontap
at
the
upandcoming
safari
club
the
beer
seemed
very
delicate
on
the
tongue
with
an
almost
champagnelike
quality
i
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
a
good
flavored
aromatic
ale
a
very
nice
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
this
brew
pours
a
very
deep
golden
with
a
very
nice
white
head
the
aromas
are
spicy
and
inticing
but
too
sweet
the
aromas
are
a
bit
subdued
compared
to
the
draught
version
of
this
brew
but
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
too
damn
sweet
this
could
be
a
very
good
belgian
ale
if
they
tone
down
the
sweetness
and
spiciness
a
bit
and
add
some
more
malthop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
thick
and
syrupy
yet
less
syrupy
than
on
tap
but
not
too
bad
and
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
sweetness
glowing
golden
yellow
color
strong
medium
white
bubbly
thick
head
appears
fades
within
a
short
while
to
a
thin
skim
and
thin
ring
lace
in
minimal
strings
nice
nose
of
malty
sweetness
dulled
mild
citrus
and
banana
yeasted
spice
and
tiny
phenolic
notes
coming
through
as
it
warms
taste
is
quite
mild
of
malt
sweetness
wheat
some
dulled
citrusy
lemon
notes
with
a
touch
of
banana
and
spices
its
a
nice
mix
with
some
light
hops
finishes
pretty
strong
with
a
big
fullness
on
the
palate
and
some
fruity
dryness
with
peppery
notes
the
feel
is
well
carbonated
with
a
slightly
small
start
but
grabs
hold
quickly
and
becomes
quite
full
with
a
nice
subtle
dry
finish
thats
crisp
and
dulled
of
citrus
and
spice
not
all
that
flavorful
or
complex
but
the
carbonation
makes
up
for
some
of
that
a
pretty
nice
blond
abbey
that
comes
across
like
a
hefe
on
steroids
nice
looking
deep
golend
streams
of
co2
rise
at
a
rapid
clip
a
big
fluffy
white
head
adorns
the
surface
lacing
if
full
and
intricate
aromas
musty
and
yeasty
a
little
spicy
bready
pretty
good
flavors
are
crisp
and
refined
bready
yeastiness
is
quite
nice
some
subdued
fruity
esters
seemingly
apples
and
pears
a
little
pepper
spiciness
pretty
nice
taste
all
together
body
is
about
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
airy
but
carbonation
seems
right
all
together
this
is
a
belgian
beer
i
would
get
again
overall
impression
its
odd
there
is
a
taste
at
the
middle
that
im
finding
distracting
smells
great
first
taste
is
equal
to
the
smell
the
finish
is
dry
and
pleasing
but
it
bottoms
out
in
the
middle
close
as
i
can
describe
it
is
a
flat
metallic
taste
which
ive
experienced
with
a
hop
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
before
maybe
the
spices
are
covering
it
there
perplexing
i
better
sample
another
1516
of
these
to
figure
it
out
will
have
to
be
in
several
sessions
this
beer
is
filling
and
isnt
quite
a
session
beer
a
good
beer
with
an
odd
weak
spot
if
you
like
the
abbeys
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
golden
blonde
so
light
you
might
call
it
a
pilsner
certainly
the
billowy
white
head
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
with
the
exception
that
the
head
stays
thick
and
is
much
longer
lasting
then
what
i
see
in
a
traditional
czech
pilsner
the
carbonation
of
this
brew
seems
to
just
go
on
and
on
a
very
nice
touch
smells
cool
and
crisp
perhaps
a
honey
aroma
in
there
taste
is
bold
and
hoppy
sweet
and
refreshing
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
reminds
me
why
belgian
strong
pale
ales
are
some
of
my
favorite
beers
on
tap
poured
into
a
leffe
glass
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
head
there
is
a
nice
row
of
lace
rings
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
lemon
and
banana
there
is
also
some
malt
and
yeast
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
anise
only
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
nice
just
a
little
light
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
a
decent
belgian
brew
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
very
good
thick
white
head
and
a
very
good
amount
of
carbonation
fruity
spicy
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
maltly
sweetness
and
some
peppery
alcohol
or
maybe
thats
the
typical
belgian
character
picking
through
very
nicely
balanced
the
hops
are
almost
undectable
this
does
have
a
very
good
amount
of
carbonation
after
sitting
for
awhile
in
a
chimay
glass
and
allowing
some
co2
to
condense
into
a
somehat
thick
head
the
mouthfeel
alomst
takes
on
a
toffeeish
slightly
syrupy
malty
mouthfeel
very
tasty
this
is
an
excellent
beer
leffe
blonde
poured
a
lovely
deep
gold
the
head
fell
to
a
very
thin
white
covering
over
the
beer
until
the
end
leaving
lots
of
lacing
a
nose
of
fruit
malt
and
yeast
feels
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
maybe
a
little
thin
followed
by
a
decent
aftertaste
not
what
i
would
call
strong
but
very
potable
this
is
a
good
belgian
blonde
ale
that
could
be
enjoyed
by
all
it
is
a
refreshing
pale
ale
and
a
good
starter
for
the
newbie
poured
a
very
clean
and
bright
golden
bronze
too
clean
and
bright
seemed
quite
processed
not
terribly
flavorful
typical
belgian
blonde
ale
flavor
profile
but
muted
and
pedestrian
some
vague
fruity
flavors
and
a
bit
of
yeast
but
nothing
that
reaches
out
and
grabs
your
attention

this

comments

theres
nothing
real
exciting
to
this
one
but
it
got
the
job
done
it
lacked
the
bite
that
i
personally
enjoy
in
a
good
bspa
but
went
about
its
business
successfully
dark
yellowish
brew
with
a
nice
foamy
head
i
taste
the
usual
belgium
spice
but
still
less
present
then
i
would
have
hope
for
this
beer
is
also
less
hearthy
then
i
would
have
liked
i
guess
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
belgium
brew
but
not
up
to
the
level
of
a
great
brew
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
that
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
light
lace
around
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
yeast
and
malt
some
fruit
and
honey
flavor
is
rich
and
sweet
without
being
overpowering
smooth
mouthfeel
delivers
yeasty
biscuity
flavor
over
the
tongue
with
a
slight
carb
tingle
and
a
lingering
hop
bitter
light
flavor
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
but
unspectacular
in
the
realm
of
belgian
blondes
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
maybe
a
good
choice
if
i
was
looking
to
drink
a
handful
of
beers
with
a
touch
of
exotic
interest
drinkability
id
definitely
be
in
the
mood
for
another
but
the
only
time
i
drink
this
beer
is
when
im
eating
mussels
at
this
restaurant
i
go
to
on
a
semiregular
basis
otherwise
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
in
the
store
when
there
are
better
ones
in
this
style
to
be
had
a
nice
beer
leffe
poured
with
a
nice
rocky
light
tan
head
clear
golden
in
color
with
carbonation
seen
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
long
lasting
head
turns
to
a
decent
lace
which
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
of
slight
malts
yeast
and
sweet
fruity
notes
theres
also
some
citric
character
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
start
is
smooth
with
the
malts
and
fruitiness
coming
forward
first
theres
a
mild
hoppiness
towards
the
end
with
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
although
some
sweetness
does
linger
a
bit
leffe
seems
to
be
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
unlike
the
suggestion
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
that
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
carbonation
is
moderate
on
the
tongue
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
for
the
most
part
but
does
become
a
bit
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavors
in
this
belgian
ale
dont
hit
the
palette
as
they
typically
do
in
most
other
belgians
the
flavors
are
more
subtle
making
for
an
easy
drinking
belgian
that
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
gorgeous
looking
beer
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
longlasting
head
highly
carbonated
aroma
is
pretty
strong
with
clove
and
bannana
taste
is
very
sweet
and
quite
yeasty
very
refreshing
but
simple
in
the
taste
kinda
one
dimensional
for
a
belgian
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
certainly
good
for
a
belgian
ale
trying
this
on
tap
was
fun
and
interesting
the
beer
definitely
didnt
bore
me
thats
for
sure
the
bar
i
was
at
in
harvard
sq
had
an
interbrew
tap
with
leffe
blonde
hoegaarden
and
stella
poured
nice
yellow
color
unfortunately
not
much
head
due
to
the
bartenders
pour
smells
of
sour
wheat
and
sweet
malt
i
dont
detect
much
in
the
way
of
spices
taste
is
pretty
unique
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
and
could
pick
it
out
in
a
blind
taste
test
in
a
second
has
a
sweetsour
malt
flavor
with
a
definite
and
distinct
medicine
flavor
that
provides
bite
from
phenols
there
are
some
hops
in
here
as
well
coats
the
mouth
in
a
weird
way
as
well
almost
like
cough
syrup
a
distinctive
beer
yet
very
drinkable
i
found
leffe
perfect
for
heat
and
i
was
in
france
in
the
hottest
summer
in
over
a
century
wonderful
beer
for
late
nights
when
your
winding
down
or
for
a
quick
lunch
amazing
quality
for
a
mass
produced
beer
i
hope
the
quality
does
not
diminish
in
the
bottle
as
i
brought
a
3l
home
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
sticky
headthe
aroma
is
very
yeasty
and
a
little
fruity
taste
has
a
honey
taste
that
hits
you
right
away
along
with
some
spicey
yeast
notes
not
alot
of
fruitiness
in
the
taste
in
my
opinion
i
like
this
beer
but
there
are
alot
better
belgian
pales
out
there
i
tried
this
beer
at
eulogy
in
philly
it
really
had
a
fruity
yeasty
smell
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
touch
of
banana
a
nice
head
that
lasted
throughout
great
finish
maybe
not
the
best
of
the
belgians
but
still
a
good
brew
was
a
real
hit
with
my
wife
i
will
definately
try
again
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
it
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
left
respectable
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
malty
with
some
spiciness
like
many
belgians
the
flavor
was
somewhat
thin
and
not
very
distinct
the
wheat
was
the
most
prominent
flavor
but
i
just
really
didnt
think
there
was
anything
special
about
this
one
and
didnt
care
too
much
for
it
if
my
wife
was
writing
this
review
it
would
be
a
perfect
5
brought
home
a
six
pack
which
i
found
unique
poured
a
nice
golden
hue
no
fear
of
sediment
nice
lacey
head
the
taste
was
crisp
very
little
bite
subtle
hops
i
could
have
drank
the
entire
six
pack
myself
due
to
the
smooth
nonbitter
flavor
i
chose
to
leave
four
for
my
wife
for
the
aroma
i
find
it
slightly
drinkable
served
in
a
330cl
bottle
smelled
like
a
belgian
beer
kind
of
rich
and
somewhat
fruity
and
malty
but
the
taste
was
very
light
and
fairly
indistinctive
it
has
an
amber
color
and
the
head
poured
pretty
full
but
died
soon
after
the
carbonation
was
light
and
the
mouth
feel
nice
it
had
a
pleasant
finish
with
a
small
hint
of
hops
a
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
somewhat
tame
compared
to
all
those
other
crazy
belgians
out
there
still
at
a
price
lower
than
most
of
the
others
id
probably
have
another
one
at
some
point
this
belgian
would
be
terrific
if
it
wasnt
filtered
like
brita
water
gold
crystal
appearance
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
disipated
slightly
predominant
malt
smell
with
some
banana
fruit
and
a
little
yeast
tasted
of
malt
and
banana
little
honey
and
bubblegum
flavour
with
next
to
no
bitterness
a
disappointing
belgium
overall
ask
anyone
what
their
first
belgium
beer
was
and
i
guarantee
that
90
will
say
stella
artois
chimay
hoegaarden
or
leffe
widely
available
at
even
the
smallest
dive
bar
in
belgium
so
much
so
that
i
often
find
i
heavily
rely
on
a
leffe
blonde
at
4am
in
the
morning
after
a
serious
day
on
the
beer
despite
the
tendency
to
knock
this
beer
for
its
massappeal
i
will
most
certainly
refrain
from
doing
so
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
blonde
ale
it
is
no
westie
12
merely
the
equivalent
of
a
session
beer
that
happens
to
be
produced
by
interbrew
that
said
it
is
still
leagues
ahead
of
most
other
countries
session
beers
imho
a
decent
solid
blonde
beer
that
has
enough
restrained
flavors
to
convert
macro
drinkers
whilst
having
enough
character
to
retain
some
loyalty
from
seasoned
drinkers
i
still
occasionally
enjoy
this
beer
and
will
continue
to
do
so
far
better
on
draft
than
from
the
bottle
i
find
a
pleasant
slightly
sour
and
fruity
beer
complicated
the
aftertaste
is
the
only
thing
that
i
would
change
it
stays
with
you
and
is
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
golden
hues
rich
with
a
slight
head
and
was
served
in
a
genuine
leffe
chalice
i
really
enjoyed
this
strong
clove
notes
as
from
any
good
beligium
this
beer
was
better
than
i
had
remembered
and
i
savored
it
with
each
sip
this
is
a
fairly
tame
belgian
though
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
to
get
into
the
style
also
is
a
major
brew
of
sorts
yeast
and
spiciness
of
the
clove
do
stay
to
the
back
enough
to
be
a
transitional
beer
all
in
all
a
great
brew
deserving
of
its
reputation
poured
slow
to
avoid
an
eruption
out
of
the
glass

throughout
the
beer
nice

smell

sweet
and
perfumey
typical
belgian
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
almost
champagnelike
these
are
nicely
balanced
to
create
a
very
drinkable
blonde
took
a
break
from
the
tasting
to
let
it
warm
up
and
more
of
the
flavor
that
i
fell
in
love
with
when
drinking
this
beer
on
draught
is
coming
out
orginally
this
was
my
first
belgian
beer
and
i
have
been
waiting
for
months
to
try
it
again
last
time
it
was
on
draft
and
had
a
tad
more
character
but
nonetheless
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
bottled
version
i
will
always
go
back
to
this
one
and
always
recommend
it
as
a
stepping
stone
to
some
of
the
more
prominent
belgians
served
in
a
goblet
with
a
leffe
logo
even
on
it
which
didnt
impress
me
too
much
i
have
one
at
home
thin
layer
of
head
around
the
rim
appearance
was
a
pale
cloudy
straw
what
i
expect
from
a
light
belgian
nose
was
sweetish
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
applepear
taste
was
sweetlysour
less
spice
than
was
in
the
nose
but
definitely
notes
of
applepear
in
there
thick
mouthfeel
an
okay
sipping
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
meal
but
nothing
in
the
realm
of
a
sessional
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
then
when
held
up
into
the
sunlight
produced
a
beam
of
pure
24
karat
gold
on
my
arm
the
head
that
was
produced
was
thick
foamy
and
long
lasting
almost
too
long
lasting
it
was
a
light
beigewhite
color
the
lace
that
was
created
was
intricate
and
delicate
in
nature
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
and
bottle
were
of
malt
fresh
hops
grass
fruit
pears
bananas
bread
and
spice
black
pepper
the
tastes
that
rolled
across
my
tongue
were
of
sweet
malt
fresh
baked
bread
bananas
fruit
pears
hops
floral
herb
a
slight
alcohol
and
i
swear
cocoa
very
slight
but
i
swear
i
tasted
it
the
aftertaste
when
first
poured
was
drying
on
the
tongue
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
creamy
and
a
banana
flavor
emerged
decently
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
decent
mouthful
was
this
beer
it
was
fairly
crisp
fresh
sweet
and
creamy
over
all
i
must
say
though
the
aromas
and
tastes
were
not
overwhelming
or
pronounced
as
i
would
have
thought
or
liked
but
it
is
drinkable
not
the
greatest
but
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
to
it
this
beer
has
a
perfect
pure
white
head
and
the
lacing
is
fantastic
it
looks
a
little
too
dark
for
a
blonde
though
its
a
yellowish
light
brown
i
describe
the
aroma
as
thick
its
very
wheaty
but
also
smells
sweet
tastes
good
again
some
wheaty
tastes
but
its
also
sweet
and
even
a
little
syrupy
it
feels
ok
in
the
mouth
but
not
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
i
had
hoped
very
drinkable
though
not
sure
what
it
is
about
it
but
i
could
have
several
in
one
sitting
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
head
retains
itself
for
the
duration
leaving
a
nice
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
aromas
of
sweet
bananas
are
initially
detected
mixed
with
light
malt
and
a
mild
spiciness
of
cloves
the
taste
is
equal
to
the
aroma
moderately
sweet
with
a
slight
touch
of
spiciness
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
smell
spice
citrus
the
front
is
sweetish
spicy
the
middle
brings
on
a
slightly
strange
sour
malty
flavor
the
finish
is
fresh
dry
with
noticeable
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
sour
strange
overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
actually
preferred
it
cooler
than
warmer
for
that
reason
and
because
of
the
funky
aftertaste
this
beer
should
probably
be
drunk
as
quickly
as
possible
this
beer
poured
a
bright
clear
golden
with
a
effervesinet
white
head
the
head
clung
to
the
side
of
the
belgian
glass
the
aroma
was
mild
and
of
malt
the
flavor
was
mellow
and
i
could
not
taste
any
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
bubbly
from
carbonation
i
found
this
a
nice
beer
for
sipping
on
a
hot
day
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
this
again
for
awhile
it
is
too
subtle
for
me
but
for
its
style
it
was
good
i
tried
this
bier
on
a
tip
from
a
bar
keep
at
the
steelgarden
within
the
bethlehem
brew
works
all
in
all
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
colorwise
the
aroma
is
decent
with
hints
of
spice
and
fruit
a
very
legitimate
belgian
brew
that
i
would
probably
recommend
as
a
beginner
to
the
world
of
the
belgians
prost
this
pours
an
orangish
color
with
a
long
lasting
creamy
head
it
has
a
spicy
malted
nose
that
is
just
wonderful
this
beer
has
an
excellent
taste
that
is
well
complemented
by
the
creamy
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
hop
undertone
pours
with
a
beautiful
long
lasting
just
slightly
offwhite
head
resting
atop
a
clear
rich
deep
gold
liquid
fresh
fruity
and
spicy
malty
notes
in
the
nose
make
for
a
very
appetizing
harbinger
of
what
awaits
taste
is
a
tasty
candyish
mix
of
fruit
malt
a
bit
of
breadiness
all
very
freshtasting
lip
smackingly
delicious
finishes
smooth
and
deceptively
drinkable
drys
ohsoslightly
in
the
end
this
was
a
nice
find
i
recommend
it
without
reservation
this
meduim
amber
colored
beer
was
served
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
head
but
a
decent
amount
of
foam
could
be
coaxed
back
by
swirling
the
glass
the
aromas
were
strong
on
bubble
gum
orange
and
coriander
very
pleasing
the
taste
is
also
sweet
with
that
bubble
gum
note
followed
by
smooth
orange
creme
and
just
a
touch
of
coriander
some
hops
are
noticeable
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
supple
simply
luxurious
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
this
is
an
impressive
beer
and
i
can
see
why
so
many
call
it
one
of
the
favorites
found
this
one
on
tap
the
sharp
edge
creekhouse
sunshine
gold
in
color
this
beer
pours
a
nice
slightly
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
decent
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
official
glass
the
aroma
is
very
simple
sweet
and
effervescent
not
a
lot
of
hop
aroma
here
the
biggest
jump
out
you
flavor
in
the
brew
is
the
clovey
spice
that
kicks
in
during
the
finish
of
each
sip
very
sweet
simple
and
enjoyable
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
biting
the
palate
a
relatively
lighter
bodied
beer
very
good
and
refreshing
clear
gold
color
tiny
head
forming
into
a
little
but
of
lace
this
medium
bodied
brew
is
dominated
by
sweet
maltiness
with
a
zingy
carbonation
feel
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
and
alcohol
tries
to
get
through
but
becomes
just
a
hint
theres
nothing
exciting
here
a
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
brew
though
i
considered
it
refreshing
overall
uncomplicated
fine
if
unremarkable
there
is
some
spicy
taste
in
this
beer
that
makes
me
think
of
duvel
i
dont
know
what
it
is
maybe
someone
can
tell
me
however
being
a
big
duvel
fan
i
dont
think
it
tastes
as
good
as
in
the
duvel
overall
its
a
decent
blonde
with
a
special
kind
of
taste
i
dont
really
fancy
everyone
should
try
it
though
it
might
float
your
boat
basically
what
i
got
from
this
beer
was
smoothness
easy
to
drink
not
overwhelming
in
alcohol
or
taste
what
i
would
think
of
as
a
belgian
session
beer
if
you
wanted
to
drink
a
few
or
more
over
the
course
of
an
evening
nice
clear
golden
pour
white
head
which
quickly
fades
to
a
good
lace
aroma
is
sweet
maybe
cotton
candylike
initial
taste
is
bananajuice
all
the
way
quite
sweet
with
a
little
spice
in
the
end
possible
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
a
fantastic
and
consistent
brew
the
beer
is
lighter
in
body
than
most
belgians
but
it
does
not
really
hurt
it
it
is
silky
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
tingly
carbonation
and
just
a
slight
warming
out
of
the
pretty
low
alcohol
content
it
is
very
sweet
but
you
will
get
some
nice
spices
in
the
end
there
is
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
so
there
is
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
flavor
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
you
should
try
if
you
want
something
different

poured
in
a

and
taste
in
fact
i
was
surprised
that
the
alcohol
level
was
not
as
high
as
many
other
beers
ive
had
in
other
words
mild
taste
brings
out
the
alcohol
mostly
clear
why
is
this
beer
clear
dark
gold
color
bigbubbled
white
head
of
12
an
inch
laces
tend
to
decompose
a
bit
slightly
estery
aroma
touched
with
some
lemon
reserved
spicy
malt
flavor
some
sense
of
clove
and
a
more
silky
quality
thats
somewhat
honeylike
medium
carbonation
mutes
hop
senses
and
the
brew
finishes
with
an
overall
lightlybrowned
toast
effect
overall
theres
not
much
sense
of
alcohol
but
also
lacks
major
flavor
distinction
it
can
tend
toward
the
cloying
side
as
well
i
also
didnt
expect
it
to
be
as
transparent
as
it
was
a
little
to
sweet
so
much
as
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
another
a
little
to
much
alcohol
flavor
almost
like
whine
the
fruity
sweet
flavor
was
too
much
in
the
end
not
the
best
blonde
imho
my
only
concern
is
with
drinkability
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
little
to
much
constant
sweetness
for
continuous
consumption
a
translucent
gold
color
on
the
pour
the
head
magnanimous
frothy
texture
the
lace
in
pertaining
sheets
the
nose
dominated
by
the
malt
hints
of
citrus
fresh
and
clean
front
is
malt
and
cloying
sweet
top
is
lean
and
lanky
the
finish
has
minimal
carbonation
adequately
hopped
but
does
ring
by
beer
bell
pours
a
beautifull
deep
golden
colour
topped
by
a
huge
white
creamy
head
this
beer
has
a
sweet
aroma
and
sweet
taste
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
its
quite
long
lasting
its
one
of
my
2
favourite
beers
i
like
sweet
beers
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beer
then
i
wouldnt
reccomend
this
one
pours
a
very
lovely
rich
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
almost
syrup
like
the
taste
is
also
on
the
sweet
side
with
notes
of
honey
and
cream
a
nice
beer
especially
for
a
beginner
whos
just
starting
to
sample
abbeystyle
beers
i
found
that
i
like
this
beer
for
the
fact
that
it
is
not
so
overwhelming
as
most
of
the
belgian
abbeystyle
ales
but
it
will
seem
too
understated
for
abbeyale
purists
anyway
this
is
a
great
belgian
for
both
a
beginner
or
one
early
in
the
game
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
had
maybe
one
or
two
belgians
under
my
belt
and
thought
this
was
a
bit
too
busy
for
me
after
having
had
some
25
different
beers
in
the
past
month
then
trying
another
leffe
my
taste
has
developed
into
a
much
greater
appreciation
of
this
beer
so
if
you
dont
like
it
first
drink
around
some
other
tastes
and
come
back
im
fairly
certain
this
one
will
grow
on
you
crystal
clear
deep
goldenamber
with
a
hugh
foamy
rocky
white
head
that
holds
extremely
well
buoyed
by
a
very
fine
and
effervescent
carbonation
the
tiny
slow
rising
bubbles
add
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
appearance
extensive
lacing
is
created
throughout
the
serving
the
body
is
mediumfull
with
an
exceptional
creaminess
in
the
mouth
from
the
very
fine
carbonation
the
aroma
is
softly
sweet
almost
candyish
with
a
light
citrus
fruitiness
and
subtle
phenolics
the
flavor
is
a
gently
fruity
citrusy
orange
and
sweetly
grainy
malt
thats
lightly
backed
by
hop
bitterness
and
gentle
spice
it
finishes
softly
dry
with
some
gently
lingering
peppery
spiciness
thats
very
nice
and
helps
to
keep
the
sweet
malts
from
becoming
cloying
well
balanced
firm
and
round
but
somewhat
limited
in
character
an
excellent
crossover
beer
into
the
world
of
belgian
ales
too
processed
and
clean
for
a
belgian
blonde
sweet
to
the
point
of
almost
being
syrupy
on
the
palate
there
are
other
belgian
blond
ales
that
are
far
superior
to
this
one
perhaps
worth
a
try
if
you
appreciate
the
style
the
beer
is
a
goldentan
color
upon
smelling
it
i
noticed
a
slight
hop
smell
and
a
strong
fruit
smell
the
fruit
was
one
of
the
first
things
i
tasted
on
my
first
sip
afterwards
the
hoppy
bitterness
hit
but
this
was
pleasant
this
beer
is
very
good
and
very
light
and
refreshing
it
is
something
i
could
drink
easily
in
the
summer
time
tannish
in
color
and
clear
with
a
large
thick
head
foamy
even
but
evaportated
quickly
the
clearness
of
the
beer
was
striking
mine
smelled
somewhat
harsh
stale
almost
tasted
rather
sweat
lots
of
syrupy
sweet
and
citrus
very
smooth
gong
down
but
not
thin
overall
it
had
some
flashes
of
being
a
great
beer
but
the
harsh
smell
seemed
to
dominate
this
one
i
bought
this
as
a
single
bottle
of
a
pack
maybe
is
was
old
thats
why
is
what
sold
that
way
anyway
i
am
kinda
glad
i
only
had
one
to
drink
whose
next
huge
off
white
head
with
tight
carbonation
golden
amber
color
great
complex
aroma
slightly
spicy
deceptively
pale
and
drinkable
some
vanilla
and
mixed
fruit
flavor
somewhat
spicy
little
to
no
hop
character
and
leaves
beer
unbalanced
its
ok
but
i
dont
think
its
anything
outstanding
but
i
dont
think
its
meant
to
be
a
bit
sweet
and
one
of
the
more
commercial
abbey
blond
style
belgian
ales
i
thought
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
mildly
sweet
with
subtle
fruit
and
spiciness
hazy
golden
appearance
limited
complexity
when
compared
to
other
belgian
triplespales
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
a
good
entry
level
belgian
brew
cant
agree
with
the
reviews
i
thought
it
was
a
snappy
fruity
begian
single
not
as
big
or
complex
as
the
trippels
but
a
tasty
beer
none
the
less
you
should
also
make
serve
at
just
below
room
temp
as
the
flavours
seem
to
get
better
excellent
belgian
ale
unsure
of
all
the
shade
towards
it
for
now
very
disappointing
effort
from
van
steenberge
overall
i
think
something
was
off
with
this
beer
it
seems
similar
to
what
some
people
have
noticed
but
mine
seems
to
have
more
off
flavors
it
should
be
the
same
age
as
the
other
beers
that
came
in
that
belgian
pack
and
all
the
other
ones
seemed
fine
so
this
might
be
and
off
bottle
and
i
will
have
to
try
it
but
as
it
is
my
rating
stands
better
luck
next
time
guys
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
being
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
dont
expect
high
complexity
it
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
you
could
even
session
it
with
a
great
costbenefit

a

than
i
hoped

well

this

up
quite
nicely
the

taste

is

not
cloying

there

this
is

rjt
i
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
six
pack
sampler
of
belgian
beer
poured
into
a
chalice
this
beer
had
to
be
poured
immediately
lest
the
beer
would
have
flowed
out
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
hazy
amber
with
a
large
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
cap
of
head
this
beer
appears
to
be
very
carbonated
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
behind
during
consumption
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
bread
the
yeast
also
brings
fruity
esters
raisin
as
well
its
such
a
terrific
smelling
pale
ale
the
taste
follows
the
nose
its
bready
but
also
mildly
sweet
with
caramel
and
raisin
flavors
theres
also
some
mild
spices
and
a
somewhat
grassy
flavor
the
hop
bitterness
is
low
the
flavors
arent
strong
or
cloying
but
milder
and
very
enjoyable
the
body
is
light
with
high
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
you
find
this
beer
you
should
definitely
try
it
i
liked
this
beer
much
more
than
i
expected
too
i
think
it
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
for
5
2
abv
and
its
true
to
its
belgian
heritage
lots
of
caramel
and
raisin
balanced
i
got
it
as
part
of
a
6
pack
belgian
beer
sampler
and
initially
rolled
my
eyes
when
i
saw
that
one
of
the
beers
was
this
low
in
alcohol
but
im
a
convert
overall
as
i
have
been
finding
my
way
around
ambers
lately
this
one
was
a
delight
its
very
belgian
in
that
its
complex
in
taste
and
smell
its
very
good
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
these
if
it
werent
for
the
price
mouthfeel
thin
mouthfeel
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
o
pretty
bland
all
around
and
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
sort
of
surprised
its
a
belgian
ale
at
all
but
i
digress
at
5
2
abv
it
mirrors
the
bud
of
belgians
for
the
ale
category
and
would
likely
be
accepted
among
that
demographic
of
drinker
i
smellt
caramel
but
in
a
lightness
i
dont
know
from
ambers
the
taste
was
even
better
because
of
the
bitterness
i
usually
miss
in
ambers
touch
of
vanilla
and
liquorice
mouthfeel
good
overall
in
this
occasion
it
felt
that
the
waiter
was
right
atmosphere
is
decent
really
nice
foamy
head
and
plenty
of
spider
web
lacing
nose
is
a
little
off
putting
very
pungent
and
sour
overpowering
character
flavor
is
light
grains
with
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
overall
this
is
a
fair
quaff
overall
this
is
a
fine
fullbodied
beer
and
brought
an
unexpected
and
pleasurable
dark
sweetness
to
the
table
o
drinkable
but
not
great
tastes
better
than
it
smells
loads
of
malt
that
ends
super
refreshing
hops
pop
at
the
end
licorice
and
caramel
notes
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
i
am
not
sure
how
well
it
fits
into
the
belgian
pale
ale
category
if
it
was
sitting
next
to
just
about
any
of
the
ambree
styles
it
would
be
a
serious
contender
so
that
is
how
i
plan
to
score
it
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
coming
back
to
if
i
wanted
a
flavorful
light
gravity
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
had
recently
this
seems
to
be
a
fresh
example
of
this
beer
and
i
am
sure
that
this
particular
one
from
the
batch
would
last
very
long
i
may
go
back
and
rereview
the
piraat
beer
again
from
this
pack
because
the
last
one
i
reviewed
was
a
bit
stale
anyway
i
would
not
deter
anyone
from
trying
this
beer
and
i
hope
that
you
get
to
try
as
fresh
of
as
an
example
of
it
as
i
obviously
am
d
i
hate
to
say
it
but
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
ruins
it
if
you
take
a
sip
and
enjoy
the
taste
for
a
microsecond
and
then
swallow
it
will
be
alright
but
if
you
stop
too
long
and
enjoy
youre
in
for
a
bad
experience
i
couldnt
do
too
many
of
these
too
much
mineral
almost
tastes
chemically
drink
for
a
free
gift
pack
for
dads
day
ill
take
the
chance
to
try
some
new
beers
probably
will
give
it
another
shot
in
the
future
but
may
wait
awhile
o
about
average
for
style
sampled
on
june
6
2011
there
is
an
amberyellow
pour
with
a
puffy
longlasting
head
and
a
slight
cloudiness
the
aroma
is
malty
but
there
is
a
melted
butter
type
character
that
i
cannot
otherwise
define
maybe
it
was
the
yeast
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
on
the
nose
the
body
is
better
than
medium
although
it
breaks
down
into
carbonation
quickly
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
weird
bitter
and
buttery
combination
in
the
flavor
with
a
slight
hopped
ending
an
generally
enjoyable
belgian
amber
ale
the
expected
sweetness
mostly
tempered
by
the
inherent
yeast
complexities
overall
it
seems
like
a
well
crafted
beer
but
it
was
a
little
harsh
tasting
it
seemed
to
get
better
as
it
approached
room
temperature
but
it
still
wasnt
all
that
drinkable
another
beer
that
falls
in
the
category
of
happy
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
seek
out
again
its
just
too
metallic
to
be
a
session
beer
for
me
o
im
pretty
pleased
with
this
beer
though
not
a
great
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
the
belgian
characteristics
that
i
like
in
a
might
lighter
lower
alcohol
package
very
easy
to
drink
and
wont
sneak
up
on
you
the
way
some
beers
can
jd
o
good
session
beer
at
5
2
and
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
in
the
sampler
pack
from
this
brewery
faint
smell
of
yeast
and
malts
the
flavors
were
similar
but
more
intense
a
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
and
at
5
2
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
so
high
marks
for
drinkability
not
overly
complex
but
enough
there
to
keep
me
wanting
to
sip
at
it
some
more
i
picked
this
one
first
from
the
sample
pack
simply
because
it
was
midday
and
it
was
the
only
bottle
with
an
abv
less
than
6
good
choice
nice
light
maple
syrup
color
with
decent
carbonation
i
also
had
the
bottle
foam
over
the
top
before
pour
malt
and
subtle
floral
hops
in
the
nose
initial
taste
was
similarvery
mild
yet
interesting
flavors
though
never
any
negative
bitterness
or
off
flavors
nothing
too
complex
but
quite
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
pale
reddish
amber
filtered
with
a
tall
highly
retentive
head
mild
aroma
of
caramel
grains
and
light
fruit
notes
with
moderate
to
subtle
complexity
has
a
pretty
decent
flavor
similar
to
the
aroma
with
aspects
of
caramel
well
balancedwith
grassy
hops
and
some
clear
candys
poking
through
moderately
full
bodied
like
a
traditional
authentic
belgian
ale
smooth
through
the
swallow
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
living
up
to
its
namesake
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
perhaps
lacking
a
bit
in
ester
complexity
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
worthy
of
a
spring
or
summers
eve
d
drinks
light
and
easy
and
is
interesting
but
id
rather
have
an
american
amber
or
belgian
strong
good
crisp
and
clean
not
my
favorite
offering
from
belgium
but
it
still
deserves
some
merit
popped
the
top
and
a
half
second
later
the
bottle
started
to
spew
lots
of
thick
stiff
foam
with
lace
that
would
dry
where
it
is
color
is
a
9
on
the
srm
chart
smells
of
malt
pear
apple
and
more
malt
taste
flavors
of
malt
and
hops
for
the
most
part
full
and
rich
creamy
feeling
very
appealing
nice
change
of
pace
but
a
bit
hard
to
find
other
than
in
a
sampler
i
would
recommend
it
to
a
friend
who
likes
more
than
beer
from
the
big
three
d
a
pretty
solid
brew
with
a
nice
finish
11
2
oz
small
stubby
belgian
style
bottle
into
a
snifter
typical
amber
ale
color
not
particularly
impressive
head
is
fine
and
appropriate
for
the
style
nose
is
decidedly
in
the
style
of
american
amber
ales
kind
of
malty
nose
nothing
unique
in
the
hops
to
really
sink
your
teeth
into
taste
is
about
on
par
with
a
mediocre
american
amber
ale
from
the
bottle
i
was
hoping
for
an
amber
ale
with
belgian
yeast
it
was
definitely
nothing
that
interesting
congratulations
van
steenbredge
youve
brewed
a
mediocre
american
amber
and
put
it
into
a
duvel
bottle
the
only
reason
this
beer
is
getting
a
b
average
rating
on
this
site
is
the
name
of
the
brewery
obscuring
folks
taste
buds
im
sorry
but
if
your
favorite
american
brewery
had
turned
out
this
amber
instead
you
would
be
disappointed
final
thoughts
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
its
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
long
time
but
i
found
it
to
be
exceptionally
good
it
could
use
a
bit
more
intensity
but
there
isnt
honestly
much
to
complain
about
thumbs
up
drinkabilty
its
solid
for
a
low
alcohol
amber
ale
you
could
handle
46
of
these
but
the
weaker
flavor
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
decent
id
drink
again
but
wouldnt
buy
or
go
out
of
way
to
get
its
a
good
starter
belgium
ale
dit
doesnt
go
down
too
harshly
but
for
the
style
there
are
so
many
other
acquirable
beers
id
pick
first
i
imagine
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
had
to
though
easy
enough
to
drink
but
just
very
ordinary
belgian
blonde
pale
character
it
neither
immediately
gratified
with
refreshing
character
nor
invited
cautious
contemplation
drinkability
great
session
beer
and
tasty
d
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
for
it
to
be
truly
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
a
simple
beer
that
brings
a
simple
taste
some
nice
aromas
and
easy
to
drink
there
is
nothing
crazy
about
this
beer
this
is
a
simple
straightforward
beer
that
lends
itself
to
a
lunchtime
food
pairing
going
great
with
my
apple
gargonzola
walnut
salad
right
now
sweet
caramel
and
bread
malt
balanced
by
a
sharp
bitter
dryness
hints
of
grass
and
apple
light
lemon
touch
of
spiciness
from
the
yeast
drinks
a
little
more
to
the
american
pale
ale
side
than
some
but
the
yeast
profile
while
not
dominant
gives
it
away
moderate
carbonation
more
on
par
than
many
others
in
this
sixer
hard
to
fault
something
like
this
for
its
simplicity
thats
probably
what
the
goal
was
and
its
nice
to
have
a
quaffable
ale
at
certain
times
decent
enough
fairly
easy
drinking
and
worth
trying
purchased
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
5
2
abv
per
the
bottle
this
is
called
an
amber
ale
but
it
is
much
lighter
than
expected
pours
out
to
a
burnt
orange
forming
a
voluminous
poofy
head
which
grows
beyond
the
lip
of
the
glass
like
mousse
carbonation
is
very
brisk
aroma
of
tropical
fruit
spicy
phenols
and
metal
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
effervescent
with
a
thin
spritzy
body
the
taste
is
kinda
flimsy
and
a
recap
of
the
aroma
the
bitterness
is
chemical
in
nature
nondescript
and
pretty
strong
overwhelming
the
other
flavors
strong
metallic
flavor
which
overwhelms
any
subtle
qualities
of
the
beer
despite
these
flaws
due
to
its
nice
start
and
thin
body
its
easy
to
drink
d
i
could
have
this
all
night
not
something
you
need
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
but
it
lends
itself
to
session
drinking
and
is
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
lightbodied
with
sharp
carbonation
that
makes
this
refereshing
and
easy
drinking
surprisingly
very
light
in
body
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
malts
and
the
bitter
finish
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
could
be
sessionable
purchased
as
part
of
a
6
bottle
brewery
pack
from
the
control
board
in
ontario
pours
a
clear
orange
colour
that
starts
off
with
big
head
that
dissipates
really
quickly
to
almost
nothing
faint
hints
of
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
sweet
like
a
typical
belgian
ale
but
then
also
has
some
peppery
spice
flavour
is
quite
dry
leaving
almost
no
aftertaste
aggressive
carbonation
makes
this
a
bit
prickly
to
drink
an
ok
belgian
pale
ale
d
quite
drinkable
and
pretty
light
as
far
as
belgians
go
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
while
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
hopes
it
still
was
considerably
pleasant
and
id
definitely
drink
it
again
id
love
to
see
more
of
a
ballsy
version
of
this
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
white
head
decent
amount
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
nose
brings
some
nice
orange
zest
as
well
as
caramel
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
some
citrus
and
orange
though
not
quite
as
much
as
the
nose
feel
is
a
bit
light
with
good
carbonation
ever
so
slightly
dry
drinks
pretty
well
and
another
good
offering
from
van
steenberge
verdict
not
worth
the
price
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
not
sure
i
would
pay
a
premium
for
this
beer
but
its
still
good
drinkable
but
have
to
echo
the
paring
with
food
vs
session
beer
still
nicely
done
and
enjoyable
d
very
good
would
like
to
drink
this
with
dessert
i
bought
this
in
a
sampler
pack
not
the
best
of
the
group
but
definitely
worth
drinking
again
a
very
pleasant
surprise
this
belgian
pale
ale
is
far
crisper
and
cleaner
than
most
pilsners
out
there
and
puts
the
majority
of
lagers
to
shame
wow
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
this
is
your
thing
great
hot
weather
beer
i
dont
like
the
looks
of
the
peasant
folk
on
the
label
windows
up
kids
no
matter
the
liquidness
inside
pours
a
clear
blood
orange
topped
by
a
over
a
finger
of
white
bubbly
froth
the
nose
is
kinda
faint
comprising
orange
peel
hoppy
florals
and
that
delightful
belgian
yeast
character
you
know
the
one
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
holding
notes
of
citrus
zest
belgiantastic
yeast
a
small
dose
of
saisonlike
funk
greenery
floral
bitters
and
a
light
background
tinge
of
caramel
bit
heavy
on
the
bitters
though
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
crisp
finish
overall
a
nice
bpa
a
tad
bit
bitter
but
smooth
and
tasty
nonetheless
drinkanility
overall
a
good
beer
try
it
if
you
find
it
purchased
this
on
a
variety
pack
great
deal
pours
red
brownish
the
head
is
fluffy
white
and
as
it
drops
it
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aromas
of
light
malts
and
some
spices
damp
bread
i
would
say
starts
off
great
and
has
a
lingering
bitter
after
taste
quite
appropriate
forthis
style
enjoyable
will
go
well
with
some
fish
and
chips
nice
fluffy
head
atop
a
light
amber
smells
of
sweet
fresh
bread
mucho
malts
though
a
pale
it
still
gives
a
yeasty
belgique
sense
quite
good
but
nothing
peculiarly
weird
or
special
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
luscious
you
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
quite
drinkable
ales
some
pub
food
would
definitely
be
in
order
watery
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
is
a
fun
interesting
and
relatively
inexpensive
belgian
beer
and
drinking
it
was
a
unique
experience
it
does
not
at
all
deserve
the
reputation
for
mediocrity
it
seems
to
posess
in
my
mind
softly
carbonated
up
front
with
a
strong
spicy
character
that
gives
way
to
a
malty
center
and
long
spicy
dry
finish
hints
of
caramel
malt
pepper
light
fruit
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
it
kind
of
tastes
like
a
watered
down
belgian
interpretation
of
an
oktoberfestmarzen
d
rather
complex
blend
of
muted
flavors
a
bit
odd
coupled
with
soury
finish
a
fairly
sessionable
brew
my
first
sampling
of
the
belgian
amber
style
this
was
purchased
in
a
mixed
pack
of
belgian
beers
id
drink
this
again
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
is
a
worthy
part
of
the
mix
pack
from
this
brewery
bruegel
amber
ale
poured
with
a
nice
sized
cream
colored
foamy
frothy
head
that
lasts
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
yeasty
and
fruity
flavor
is
like
aroma
with
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
body
is
real
full
and
carbonation
is
good
too
nothing
real
special
for
a
belgian
ale
but
better
than
most
all
other
world
amber
ales
that
are
trying
to
mimic
this
style
this
bottle
was
left
in
my
kegerator
in
december
i
have
no
idea
where
it
came
from
but
i
finally
decided
it
was
time
to
review
it
poured
a
stubby
11
2oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
when
i
cracked
the
cap
i
only
heard
a
faint
psst
sound
as
the
co2
is
released
and
im
thinking
to
myself
oh
crap
its
flat
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
poured
it
a
nice
3
inch
head
erupted
from
the
bottle
leaving
some
nice
soapy
lacing
as
the
beer
recedes
from
my
glass
the
nose
contains
a
lot
of
pale
malts
a
slight
hint
of
apples
and
just
a
little
butter
no
real
spiciness
the
flavor
is
dull
once
again
pale
malts
dominate
the
profile
with
just
a
hint
of
fruit
not
much
more
just
a
vague
hint
of
yeast
no
much
in
terms
of
adding
to
the
flavor
profile
more
along
the
line
of
yeasty
biscuits
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
unassuming
overall
its
just
kind
of
meh
while
bpas
have
their
place
its
just
not
a
style
i
really
dig
its
a
nice
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
at
a
store
d
the
combination
of
watery
dried
malt
with
the
sour
fruit
finish
and
over
light
flavor
with
a
bit
too
much
sparkling
water
carbonation
makes
this
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
have
with
a
meal
but
not
one
that
i
will
soon
buy
again
notes
with
so
many
belgian
beers
out
there
i
figured
there
had
to
be
mediocre
ones
and
this
is
one
of
those
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
and
fruits
taste
is
good
malts
and
hops
with
some
hints
of
fruit
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
beer
is
a
little
thin
and
light
in
the
flavor
department
there
is
a
bitterness
to
it
at
the
back
but
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
up
front
in
the
way
of
some
sweetness
or
other
characters
im
not
sure
what
to
think
second
taste
mild
fruit
flavors
followed
by
the
bitterness
drinkability
is
ok
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
thin
overall
its
just
ok
d
very
simple
and
light
beer
feels
like
its
too
watered
down
and
flavors
are
not
as
powerful
as
the
should
be
this
beer
could
go
overlooked
because
of
its
subtility
but
its
great
balance
makes
drinking
it
a
great
experience
a
decent
beer
but
far
from
being
representative
of
belgian
brew
its
worth
a
try
but
not
something
ill
be
buying
again
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
very
different
from
american
and
english
pale
ales
that
im
used
to
very
drinkable
and
unlike
many
belgian
beers
this
is
good
for
sessioning
feel
and
drinkability
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
prickly
and
filling
carbonation
that
cleans
the
palate
after
each
sip
and
works
perfectly
with
the
drier
finish
that
this
one
has
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
very
simple
and
straight
forward
i
like
this
beer
there
is
nothing
real
complex
about
it
its
just
very
easy
drinking
this
is
one
that
ill
be
getting
again
definitely
one
id
recommend
if
you
need
a
break
from
real
complex
brews
and
just
want
something
easy
going
and
great
pours
a
honey
amber
yellow
color
with
a
small
peachy
head
a
nuttiness
paired
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
character
sit
in
the
nose
candy
sweet
malt
right
upfront
balanced
nicely
by
a
slight
bitterness
other
notes
of
apple
and
cherry
light
in
body
well
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
the
aroma
is
great
but
the
hop
character
is
a
bit
aggressive
for
me
in
a
belgian
drinkability
a
good
beer
and
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
not
as
good
as
orval
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
but
still
a
very
worthy
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
body
huge
offwhite
head
pretty
lasting
fruity
aroma
some
hay
and
farmlike
notes
floral
and
belgiany
too
but
those
notes
need
to
be
inhaled
deeper
some
banana
clean
taste
some
pilsner
like
taste
corn
or
vegetable
but
not
in
a
bad
way
refreshing
light
taste
thin
palate
not
very
complex
a
little
bite
but
not
very
spicy
kinda
bland
not
as
good
as
a
sierra
nevada
or
bass
bottle
into
tulip
got
this
one
as
part
of
a
6
pack
sampler
from
brouwerij
van
steenberge
poured
a
clear
orange
with
a
large
white
head
that
fell
rather
quickly
on
the
nose
you
would
think
that
this
would
be
a
very
sweet
beer
as
the
malt
was
heavy
and
there
was
a
pleasant
aroma
that
reminded
me
of
raisins
or
dates
the
taste
however
was
rather
sharp
and
not
really
what
i
expected
there
was
a
nice
bite
to
it
and
a
little
more
of
a
bitter
flavor
not
near
the
sweetness
of
the
nose
but
not
overpowering
either
this
was
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
offering
and
paired
well
with
the
spice
i
was
having
at
the
time
taste
is
fruity
and
very
belgian
it
has
a
distinct
ambermalty
taste
that
is
a
little
sweet
and
has
notes
of
honey
some
biscuity
flavors
which
are
a
little
like
fresh
baked
cookies
reminiscent
of
pizzeria
uno
amber
aka
sam
adams
boston
ale
refreshing
tasty
and
very
drinkable
the
only
loser
in
van
steenberges
belgian
mixed
six
holiday
pack
so
i
really
cannot
complain
while
bruegel
is
not
so
good
the
value
of
the
pack
at
16
99
was
exceptional
pours
pale
orange
topped
by
a
thick
pile
of
foamy
white
head
the
fairly
well
retained
head
leaves
behind
a
thick
lace
on
the
walls
of
my
glass
aroma
of
pear
funky
rotting
apple
mild
caramel
and
light
herbal
hops
i
get
the
slightest
whiff
of
alcohol
from
it
tastes
of
pear
and
apple
finishes
leafy
and
herbal
earthy
and
dry
bitterness
on
the
low
side
of
medium
it
somehow
tastes
rustic
or
at
least
what
i
would
imagine
to
be
rustic
medium
bodied
with
a
lively
fine
carbonation
satisfyingly
simple
an
easy
drinker
with
downtoearth
charm

easy
drinker
yeah
overall
its
not
offensive
but
theres
nothing
here
that
makes
me

to
go
back

more

this
is
not
a
belgian
beer
out
to
kill
and
conquer
and
it
shouldnt
be
judged
as
such
bruegel
is
your
nononsense
belgian
pale
ale
eminently
drinkable
likable
seemingly
brewed
with
love
pure
and
simple
its
a
typical
example
of
its
style
which
is
not
to
say
its
average
its
just
a
fine
straightforward
belgian
beer
and
thats
that
maybe
someday
ill
try
it
again
conclusion
not
the
best
from
this
brewery
by
any
means
the
flavors
dont
really
match
up
with
the
nice
malty
aromas
and
the
metallic
twinge
on
the
finish
is
kind
of
distractingunpleasant
drinkability
highly
drinkable
but
for
the
cumulative
aftertaste
of
all
that
yeast
i
dont
know
if
this
is
just
the
bottle
i
got
or
if
it
is
typical
for
this
beer
but
in
any
case
it
does
detract
a
bit
from
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
brew
i
poured
this
beer
before
sitting
down
to
reading
oliver
twist
for
my
capstone
i
was
planning
on
sipping
this
beer
for
at
least
six
chapters
but
i
didnt
get
through
three
before
i
had
actually
finished
the
bottle
its
a
very
simple
straightforward
belgian
pale
ale
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
very
little
head
and
lacing
on
the
glass
caused
by
my
goblet
im
certain
the
smell
isnt
anything
noteworthy
malts
yeast
straightforward
the
taste
again
has
nothing
else
to
it
really
very
simple
brewed
beer
no
need
to
mess
with
fancy
ingredients
like
dfh
here
no
the
taste
however
is
crisp
and
moderately
sweet
and
bruegel
drinks
really
well
i
finished
the
beer
faster
than
expected
just
because
you
can
tip
it
back
and
not
really
feel
the
effect
of
the
alcohol
or
sit
and
focus
on
the
different
traits
of
the
beer
its
simple
and
once
more
for
emphasis
straightforward
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
id
probably
never
purchase
bruegel
again
but
im
not
disappointed
i
drank
it
either
this
beer
is
excellent
with
a
lot
of
earthieness
to
it
it
poured
off
a
nice
crisping
white
head
and
the
the
hoppy
flavor
came
out
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
of
liked
anyway
i
wont
buy
it
again
just
due
to
the
fact
that
its
not
really
strong
enough
for
me
d
what
a
nice
find
this
is
a
solid
session
ale
here
belgian
pale
ale
not
really
more
like
a
scottish
amber
ale
the
bottle
claims
it
is
a
amber
ale
which
i
believe
is
more
accurate
whatever
it
is
its
well
balanced
and
pleasant
drinking
d
overall
this
is
average
for
a
belgian
brew
i
expected
more
flavor
enjoyable
and
finishes
in
a
wellbalanced
and
predictably
smooth
manner
but
the
finish
sums
up
and
retains
all
the
notable
characteristics
and
carries
them
through
to
the
end
nice
earthy
woodladen
suppleness
to
the
back
end
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
special
certainly
drinkable
but
not
a
memorable
experience
4
a
pretty
basic
but
enjoyable
beer
seems
more
diginified
than
its
marketing
thinking
mainly
of
the
flyer
tucked
into
the
sixbox
d
its
not
bad
but
everything
just
kept
sliding
down
hill
after
the
first
few
sips
drinkability
seems
like
it
would
be
good
had
i
got
one
that
was
fresher
i
believe
yet
another
pale
belgian

nice
bitterness
at

good

very
nice
overall
and
recommended
when
i
look
at
the
other
scores
for
this
beer
i
have
to
conclude
its
seriously
underrated
poured
from
the
squat
11
2
oz
bottle
clear
amber
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
is
a
bit
clovey
taste
is
weak
and
metallic
some
nutmeg
and
pepper
some
grass
watery
and
uninspiring
would
be
best
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
then
this
brew
would
be
refreshing
otherwise
a
bit
too
much
like
a
lite
version
of
what
it
should
be
m
d
spritzy
assertive
and
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
pretty
easy
drinking
and
the
lower
alcohol
content
assists
in
keeping
it
that
way
not
too
bad
at
all
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
sample
from
the
brewery
sample
pack
of
6
this
beer
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
head
the
smell
is
bready
malt
with
some
candylike
sweetness
the
taste
start
off
with
a
mix
of
a
dry
cider
and
lemony
citrus
that
gives
way
to
a
bit
of
spiciness
not
unpleasant
but
a
little
onenote
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
with
some
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
not
going
to
blow
anyones
mind
the
second
half
of
the
beer
complimented
a
slice
of
leftover
pepperoni
and
onion
pizza
surprisingly
well
i
could
definitely
see
have
a
good
number
of
these
and
getting
a
good
buzz
while
im
at
it
poured
from
one
of
the
coolest
looking
bottles
i
have
ever
seen
a
stubby
330ml
with
beautiful
artwork
on
the
label
orange
amber
with
a
smalloff
white
head
that
leaves
some
very
fine
lace
on
the
glass
smells
like
buttery
toasted
grain
and
honey
tastes
like
buttered
toast
with
an
acidic
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightly
carbonated
and
lighter
bodied
a
nice
beer
that
doesnt
quite
live
up
the
the
impressive
packaging
not
the
best
beer
but
drinkable
and
hey
early
pipes
d
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
it
it
doesnt
seem
like
much
but
ive
had
this
before
with
food
and
it
was
very
interesting
it
has
the
positive
attributes
of
being
light
dry
and
refreshing
not
too
high
in
alcohol
a
loweralcohol
belgian
again
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
suggest
drinking
it
with
food
pretty
much
any
food
notes
unfortunately
the
worst
of
any
i
have
tasted
by
this
brewer
all
other
brews
by
brouwerij
van
steenberge
have
been
superb
this
is
from
a
sampler
pack
and
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
i
would
still
highly
recommend
others
by
this
brewer
including
augustijn
piraat
ale
and
bornem
triple
drinkability
pleasant
and
easily
drinkable
but
leaves
you
looking
for
a
bit
more
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
smells
fruity
with
a
strong
suggestion
of
plums
and
tartness
taste
is
fascinating
big
on
the
sour
plums
green
apples
hints
of
grapefruit
and
some
sweet
malts
whose
sweetness
cant
quite
break
through
the
light
pucker
it
has
a
delicate
tartness
that
im
really
digging
medium
body
transmits
and
distributes
the
spectrum
of
flavors
quite
well
if
tartness
is
not
a
quality
you
like
in
a
beer
then
this
one
is
not
for
you
but
i
personally
consider
bruegel
to
be
a
very
interesting
extremely
pleasant
beer
d
light
and
very
drinkable
mouthhfeel
is
kind
of
sour
and
ends
on
a
dry
note
medium
bodied
nicely
drinkable
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
smelled
like
perfume
to
me
the
taste
was
sour
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
an
amber
ale
as
stated
on
the
bottle
sweet
and
malty
as
well
but
more
sour
than
anything
moutfeel
was
average
and
drinkablility
for
me
was
not
there
as
i
did
not
find
the
sour
taste
anything
appealing
im
glad
only
one
of
these
came
in
the
sampler
pack
i
got
for
xmas
11
2
oz
stubby
bottle
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
faded
quickly
but
left
a
lingering
lace
on
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
fresh
fruit
light
fruity
taste
light
and
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
tang
finish
very
enjoyable
but
only
had
the
one
bottle
to
sample
notes
from
71204
d
im
mixed
on
this
one
i
didnt
like
it
at
first
but
its
sour
flavor
grew
on
me
of
the
sixer
i
bought
filled
with
varied
offerings
from
van
steenberge
this
is
my
least
favorite
its
not
a
dud
and
is
decent
on
the
whole
yet
it
lacks
definitive
characteristics
a
gotcha
aspect
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
offered
to
me
in
the
future
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
bruegel
i
got
it
in
a
sampler
pack
so
i
dont
know
its
individual
pricing
but
i
dont
plan
on
buying
it
again
unless
its
cheaper
than
i
expect
it
to
be
im
too
poor
to
use
belgians
as
session
beers
i
believe
this
is
my
first
amber
ale
from
belgian
but
who
knows
anymore
im
almost
at
300
reviews
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
and
balanced
not
overwhelming
in
any
direction
of
flavor
i
really
dont
mind
sour
ales
but
im
not
sure
that
this
is
what
they
were
going
for
the
sourness
settles
on
the
back
and
sides
of
mouth
give
it
a
bit
of
a
strange
feel
on
the
front
on
the
tongue
it
settles
more
evenly
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
more
mellow
in
the
mouth
one
i
may
buy
a
few
four
packs
of
to
keep
around
for
company
if
theyre
not
too
expensive
drinks
okay
this
one
just
seem
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
more
hops
malt
base
or
both
are
in
order
here
very
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
both
with
a
meal
or
on
its
own
taste
follows
suit
with
moderately
sweet
malt
flavors
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
spicy
finish
with
cinnamon
and
orange
feel
is
ok
though
the
high
level
of
carbonation
detracts
a
bit
and
the
drinkability
is
average
good
to
try
but
a
revisit
is
unlikely
also
i
agree
with
others
assertions
that
this
is
probably
mis
labled
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
to
me
it
is
a
straight
up
amber
as
the
bottle
announces
very
watery
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
not
enough
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
mediumbodied
with
fine
carbonation
the
beer
is
drinkable
if
decidedly
unspectacular
this
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
when
i
sampled
it
the
color
was
gold
with
a
white
froth
head
it
kind
of
had
a
taste
like
apple
wine
with
even
less
sweetness
smell
was
kind
of
like
spoiled
wine
or
vinegar
it
had
a
nice
clean
bubbly
feel
and
a
crisp
finish
i
liked
unfortunately
the
overall
taste
was
less
pleasant
and
it
made
it
less
drinkable
in
my
oppinion
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
damn
tasty
amber
ale
just
dont
smell
it
d
with
the
other
belgies
ive
had
this
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
would
not
turn
one
down
but
there
are
better
ones
out

should
do
this
this
beer
is
solid
but
not
one
to
rave
about
perhaps
seen
in
this
quick
review
as
far
as
the
stubby

invite
goes
there
are
two
more
beers
remaining
and
those
should
be
the
most
fun
well
resume
play
tomorrow
night
even
with
the
late
stumbles
the
encounter
was
enjoyable
ill
give
it
another
try
if
only
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
redemption
i
had
to
pour
this
one
out
halfway
through
the
glass
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
sour
taste
and
the
awful
aftertaste
left
in
my
mouth
i
would
pass
on
this
one
if
you
expect
more
out
of
an
expensive
belgian
notes
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
it
had
a
nice
refreshing
character
that
would
work
very
well
with
a
light
lunch
sea
food
mild
cheese
or
fruit
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
necessarily
one
that
would
be
on
my
short
list
of
beers
that
i
would
go
right
after
got
this
one
in
a
belgian
sampler
and
tried
with
fellow
bas
moxley
and
hyland
i
thought
about
nose
greasing
the
head
on
this
one
all
3
inches
of
it
when
it
settled
it
was
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
with
a
musty
dusty
smell
not
too
far
from
a
wet
attic
the
taste
was
eww
nasty
it
was
an
acidic
overly
carbonated
foul
sour
and
dry
combination
that
was
really
bad
it
had
too
much
carbonation
and
the
flavor
was
strong
and
offensive
maybe
we
just
had
a
bad
bottle
d
a
good
session
beer
due
to
its
low
alcohol
if
your
into
this
sort
of
thing
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
amber
ales
but
if
i
had
to
go
with
an
amber
belgian
would
be
the
route
i
would
take
mfd
too
carbonated
very
dry
overall
not
impressed
by
this
one
at
all
dont
bother
needless
to
say
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
beer
again
pretty
average
sort
of
a
redcopper
colour
almost
rusty
but
not
quite
poured
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
first
sniff
seems
a
bit
off
musty
almost
farm
like
smell
reminded
me
of
my
grandfathers
farm
i
like
it
but
it
seems
a
bit
odd
for
a
beer
second
sniff
reveals
more
fruits
citrus
red
apples
and
a
bit
of
bread
and
honey
very
light
taste
sweet
and
simple
some
breads
malts
citrus
and
honey
no
aftertaste
at
all
mouthfeel
is
thin
light
and
a
bit
crisp
i
wouldnt
necessarily
say
its
a
bad
beer
perhaps
average
certainly
better
then
say
the
offerings
they
have
at
the
sports
bar
but
nothing
about
it
shines
or
pops
its
simple
its
something
i
wouldnt
avoid
but
definitely
something
i
would
not
buy
again

sixlivingbeers
gift
set
from
garys
in
madison
this
was
the
beer
from
the
brewery
with
the
lowest
alcohol
percentage
never
heard
of
this
beer
or
company
before
but
the
price
was
right
so
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
really
nice
reddish
copper
color
with
modest
head
smell
is
fruity
with
hints
of
citrus
and
caramel
taste
was
good
very
nutty
with
a
rich
sweet
enticing
taste
that
was
smooth
and
not
at
all
bitter
a
relatively
low
alcohol
percentage
for
the
style
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
mouthfeel
this
would
make
for
a
decent
session
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
come
back
to
this
one
unless
it
was
in
a
big
bottle
maybe
and
thats
it
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
but
theres
better
beers
from
this
style
out
there
overall
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
it
is
a
well
done
beer
worth
trying
tastes
similar
to
the
nose
pale
malt
yeast
and
fruits
very
clean
and
smooth
d
if
this
beer
was
any
more
boring
id
fall
asleep
drinking
it
the
full
body
holds
the
flavors
well
and
puts
forth
a
bit
of
creaminess
quite
nice
actually
this
ends
up
being
a
very
drinkable
ale
id
get
more
if
it
were
available
in
something
other
than
the
van
steenberge
holiday
package
with
five
other
beers
o
enjoyable
but
not
as
complex
as
one
would
like
good
for
a
few
before
getting
bored

d
got
this
one
in
a
sampler
pack
so
its
going
to
be
hard
to
just
get
this
individually
but
ill
try
its
that
good
besides
anything
from
belgium
is
worth
drinking
again
and
again
tasty
belgian
amber
ale
very
drinkable
and
smooth
light
bodied
for
a
belgian
recommended
for
fans
of
lightly
hopped
but
otherwise
flavorful
ales
this
is
not
the
best
belgian
ive
had
in
fact
i
think
its
probably
my
last
choice
i
dont
know
if
the
oxidized
flavors
and
aromas
are
intentional
or
if
this
is
a
function
of
its
age
perhaps
it
would
be
better
closer
to
the
source
and
fresher
this
is
a
brown
beer

slightly
cloudy
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
is
unique
it
is
quite
malty
and
has
caramel
overtones
there
are
some
hints
of
spices
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
smokiness
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
comes
together
well
which
makes
it
quite
drinkable
pours
a
copperish
amber
hue
with
minimal
lightcolored
head
aromas
are
primarily
sweet
with
a
bit
of
candi
sugar
in
there
plus
some
sourfruit
yeastiness
not
too
interesting
on
the
palate
nutty
amber
malts
and
some
doughiness
remind
me
of
a
vienna
lager
or
maybe
a
yuengling
although
there
are
more
acidity
and
fruity
esters
here
a
touch
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
with
some
astringency
toward
the
end
overall
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
not
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
or
one
killer
app
bleh
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
on
this
one
after
half
a
glass
i
feel
like
ive
got
heartburn
cant
say
ill
be
going
back
for
more
overall
an
interesting
brew
that
displayed
some
unique
flavor
combinations
at
times
a
bit
too
much
going
on
an
average
belgium
for
me
has
a
pretty
neat
taste
i
must
admit
feels
like
it
might
be
best
as
an
autumn
beer
but
it
also
is
neither
dynamic
nor
amazing
enjoyable
something
id
be
more
inclined
to
buy
to
share
with
friends
than
just
for
myself
the
next
time
overall
i
really
didnt
care
too
much
for
it
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
not
much
of
a
head
but
did
leave
a
ton
of
lacing
im
more
familiar
with
american
style
pale
ales
begain
pale
ales
are
very
different
this
one
is
very
good
and
very
drinkable
goes
down
so
smooth
with
a
great
finish
nicely
carbonated
the
color
is
gold
and
clear
with
no
hazing
or
sediment
has
a
refreshing
finish
that
is
only
a
touch
of
the
bitter
side
no
hops
in
the
taste
or
aroma
taste
is
not
too
complex
and
either
is
the
aroma
i
prefer
the
american
style
pale
ale
this
taste
more
like
an
amber
ale
other
than
very
light
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
a
breadgrain
taste
there
isnt
much
of
a
distinct
taste
the
bruegal
amber
is
a
good
belgian
pale
that
came
in
a
six
pack
sampler
of
belgian
ales
it
pours
clear
dark
amber
without
much
of
a
head
and
a
mildly
sour
biscuity
malt
aroma
based
on
the
smell
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
boy
was
i
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
should
appeal
to
a
large
variety
of
tastes
i
cannot
say
that
anything
in
particular
really
jumped
out
at
me
while
drinking
it
but
by
the
time
i
was
done
i
was
left
hoping
that
there
was
another
in
my
sampler
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
amber
highlights
not
much
of
a
head
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
artifical
butter
blah
the
taste
is
buttery
caramel
malt
no
hop
detected
the
feel
is
light
almost
watery
fizzy
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
an
amber
ale
as
stated
on
the
label
at
all
to
me
almost
tastes
like
a
funky
pilsner
or
macro
i
have
had
this
before
and
dont
recall
it
being
this
poor
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
drinkability
i
dont
care
for
belgian
ales
having
said
that
this
stuff
is
retty
good
it
has
a
nice
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
and
the
taste
aint
half
bad
compared
to
its
bigger
cousins
this
could
be
judged
a
little
average
but
it
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
to
quaff
overall
this
is
a
satisfying
light
refreshing
and
flavorful
belgian
amber
easy
yet
subtly
mystifying
could
operate
as
a
nice
session
beer
though
is
probably
priced
too
high
for
that
or
an
introduction
for
the
unitiated
into
belgians
i
could
also
see
it
paring
well
certain
sharp
cheeses
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
often
for
those
new
to
belgians
this
might
be
a
nice
introduction
but
for
fans
id
stick
to
the
bigger
stuff
this
is
actually
quite
an
interesting
amber
let
it
sit
for
a
bit
d
very
drinkable
nice
to
consume
and
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
definitely
have
another
quite
refreshing
loved
it
poured
an
orangeamber
leaving
almost
no
head
the
thin
head
there
was
vanished
within
a
minute
aroma
was
mostly
malty
sweetness
some
light
fleshy
fruits
apparent
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
dominated
by
apples
pears
and
green
grapes
fruity
to
the
point
of
almost
seeming
like
a
cider
slightly
dry
finish
zero
bitterness
at
all
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
flat
perhaps
i
served
it
too
cold
i
imagine
if
i
hadnt
taken
it
straight
from
the
fridge
there
woudl
have
been
more
head
and
more
carbonation
definitely
drinkable
as
a
session
brew
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
is
quite
refreshinng
but
im
not
going
to
hunt
for
it
either
there
are
many
better
options
to
serve
that
purpose
aroma
dominated
by
the
sharp
twang
of
vinegar
offbalance
in
the
mouth
too
however
as
the
beer
warmed
this
dominating
flavor
receded
and
became
more
of
a
nice
background
with
caramel
malt
and
mild
hops
in
the
foreground
however
sourness
is
definitely
a
defining
feature
of
this
brew
fairly
refreshing
and
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
clear
light
amber
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
a
bit
overpowering
with
too
much
sugar
taste
is
also
exceedingly
sweet
with
no
yeast
characteristic
and
a
light
body
that
doesnt
really
hold
up
very
well
i
also
didnt
notice
any
bitterness
as
mentioned
in
the
description
definitely
not
something
that
i
would
seek
again
overall
not
too
bad
certainly
is
worth
a
try
poured
out
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
good
carbonation
supporting
a
nice
white
head
big
time
retention
with
competent
lacing
the
nose
introduces
some
rich
buttery
malt
and
a
hint
of
bubblegum
the
taste
is
mostly
a
spicy
malt
kicked
up
by
a
caramelized
grain
flavor
the
finish
is
still
sweet
bellied
finally
by
faint
hops
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
whisking
away
the
cloying
flavor
of
the
beer
before
it
starts
to
get
on
your
nerves
pours
a
cloudy
brownorange
loose
off
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
layer
with
big
bubbles
lacing
all
around
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
buttery
lots
of
citrus
some
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
weird
citrus
acidity
some
toffee
very
weak
finish
little
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
acidic
some
warmth
with
this
one
i
think
creamy
smoothness
if
you
are
in
a
nonbitter
beer
mood
this
is
one
of
the
first
ones
you
should
try

mud

good
off

of
sour

pears
apples

apples
green

carbonated
aftertaste
sour
green
apples

apricots
poured
a
decent
golden
color
with
a
moderate

smell
was
slightly
fruity
with
some
caramel
coming
through
taste
was
fuity
as
well
id
say
mainly
apples
and
maybe
some
pear
too
there
was
a
bit
of
a
metallic
flavor
too
but
not
much
very
high
in
carbonation
which
diffused
as
it
warmed
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
on
the
warmer
side
though
i
would
try
this
again
but
i
think
there
are
plenty
others
in
this
style
that
are
better

fl

6pack
obtained
at
florians
in
auburn
smells
like
butterscotch
and
bandaids
uhoh
somewhat
murky
yellowred
body
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
unpleasantly
astringent
tastes
like
bad
citrus
mixed
with
diacetyl
or
like
cat
urine
smells
i
must
have
a
bad
bottle
too
bad
too
since
its
probably
the
only
bottle
ill
ever
have
the
first
belgian
ive
ever
had
to
pour
out
d
a
little
on
the
dull
side
if
you
ask
me
not
a
lot
of
complexity
not
flavour
in
general
but
whats
there
is
inoffensive
bruegel
could
honestly
use
a
touchup
while
it
may
paint
a
picture
as
to
what
belgian
ales
are
all
about
it
fails
to
capture
the
colourful
characterful
artistry
of
most
of
that
countrys
brewers
its
by
no
means
that
regions
pièce
de
résistance
more
like
the
highschool
equivalent
still
it
proves
that
as
a
group
the
belgians
are
one
naturally
talented
group
feels
slightly
creamy
in
my
mouth
and
that
fruity
smell
comes
through
in
the
taste
just
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
thats
more
noticeable
once
youve
completely
swallowed
it
but
youll
probably
want
to
swish
this
one
around
a
little
bit
before
you
do
that
very
tasty
stuff
i
can
imagine
this
going
well
with
a
slice
of
apple
pie
for
some
reason
or
perhaps
even
a
peach
strudel
i
would
probably
not
waste
any
more
cash
on
this
one
when
there
are
much
better
beers
staring
me
in
the
face
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
slightly
odd
metallic
twang
in
the
back
a
dry
hoppiness
combined
with
a
caramel
smoothness
that
makes
for
an
interesting
trip
on
the
palate
the
nuttiness
is
there
too
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
the
carbonation
isnt
overbearing
which
is
a
big
plus
on
the
whole
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
a
bit
too
mixedup
for
my
liking
too
thin
too
sweet
drinkability
is
good
for
a
warm
summers
day
medium
amber
in
colour
with
average
carbonation
aromas
of
caramel
and
vanilla
custard
an
unusual
combo
yet
quite
nice
more
caramel
and
custeard
in
the
mouth
along
with
some
notes
of
dried
fruit
especially
banana
chips
burnt
sugar
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
medium
bodied
but
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
this
isnt
one
of
those
super
complex
high
octane
belgians
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
a
belgian
session
ale
perhaps
if
such
a
thing
even
exists

i
just
may
have
gotten

but
honestly
i
dug
the
taste
overall
it
was
good

id
have
another
oelergud
md
thintextured
and

the
beer
is
so
uninteresting
that
its
way
behind
the
standards
of
belgian
ales
i
suspect
its
underperformance
is
to
do
with
the
overchilled
serving
temp
but
i
still
dont
think
it
could
be
much
better
even
it

this
beware
of
this
brewery
van

is
not
very
good
the
bruegel
amber
ale
pours
into
the
snifter
as
a
cloudy
amber
color
there
is
minimal
head
presence
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
malty
no
indication
of
the
hops
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
in
being
yeasty
even
though
care
was
taken
to
decant
properly
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
crisp
with
only
a
small
residue
sticking
to
the
tongue
a
tasty
treat
but
not
what
i
would
consider
a
beverage
with
high
drinkability
give
it
a
try

and
some

very
malty
tatse
with
a
bit
of
a

seems
a
bit
watery
not
very
hoppy
just
a
very
average
brew
not
gross
but
nothing
special
either
i
wouldnt
seek
these
beers
out
or
add
it
to
my
favorite
list
but
if
they
were
around
i
could
easily
kick
back
and
drink
a
few
this
beer
would
probobly
be
pretty
great
with
a
meal
or
at
least
better
than
it
is
on
its
own
the
carbonation
is
crisp
and
refreshing
to
the
palate
once
again
i
swear
that
this
is
a
belgian
oktoberfest
its
good
but
probably
not
worth
its
price
considering
there
are
some
great
real
ofests
available
for
much
cheaper
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
5pack
from
the
brewery
for
christmas
and
this
is
the
first
and
weakest
of
the
bunch
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
like
piraat
i
do
like
the
gulden

im
optimistic

with
a

lasted

that

strong

off

clear
rich

with

thin

coloured

some

over
into

with

towards
sweetness

in
terms
of
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
overall
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
but
this
is
pretty
drinkable
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
a
session
out
of
it
do
to
the
lopsided
sweetness
but
drinking
one
is
an
enjoyable
experience
a
nice
beer
that
falls
short
of
being
a
great
beer
still
this
is
certainly
worth
the
ocassianal
purchase
nice
first
beer
of
the
day
also
quite
original
a
nondescript
beer
really
fairly
subtle
in
flavor
and
feel
but
pleasant
enough
a
worthy
beer
this
is
a
easy
drinking
amber
although
it
isnt
exceptional
the
slightly
unusual
character
of
this
brew
makes
it
above
average
overall
a
nice
and
easy
to
drink
belgian
pale
with
nothing
real
special
about
it
this
beer
is
light
amber
in
color
that
keeps
a
nice
thin
head
with
minor
lacing
i
dont
know
if
it
was
intended
but
this
one
has
a
slight
haze
to
it
it
wasnt
bottle
conditioned
so
im
not
sure
whats
going
on
here
smells
a
bit
sour
lie
a
flemish
with
a
powdered
sugar
sweetness
maybe
some
coffee
too
and
some
earth
the
sour
and
the
sweet
carries
over
to
the
flavor
along
with
a
noticeable
bread
dough
finishes
smooth
and
leaves
a
vegetable
flavor
like
limes
and
celery
odd
but
rather
tasty
i
must
say
that
i
kept
thinking
that
i
was
drinking
a
lager
very
strange
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
with
sparse
big
bubbles
that
are
actually
quite
a
bit
of
fun
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
its
over
all
qualities
are
rather
subdued
nothing
really
stood
up
and
got
my
attention
but
good
none
the
less
11
2
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
fruity
bready
aromas
caramel
and
honey
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
above
average
amber
d
well
it
goes
down
easily
but
the
brackish
bitterness
and
the
slimy
mouthfeel
make
for
an
awful
aftertaste
at
first
sip
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
real
treat
but
that
was
hardly
the
case
11
2
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
poured
this
one
into
my
pint
glass
with
moderate
expectations
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
ambers
but
i
have
not
tried
a
true
belgian
amber
so
i
figured
it
was
worth
a
try
appearance
was
average
with
only
a
small
1
finger
head
that
quickly
disappeared
smell
was
on
the
sour
fruit
side
with
minimal
malt
presence
taste
was
initially
lightly
malt
that
quickly
gave
way
to
that
unpleasant
sourness
that
appeared
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
sharp
almost
puckering
i
did
not
like
this
one
at
all
but
i
think
it
may
have
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
little
to
long
however
i
purchased
it
in
a
global
beer
pack
and
the
rest
of
the
offerings
seemed
to
be
plenty
fresh
bruegel
amber
is
an
authentic
belgian
pale
ale
that
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
its
a
good
one
i
do
like
it
but
i
keep
expecting
to
like
it
more
than
i
do
just
wait
til
it
warms
just
wait
til
the
good
stuff
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
is
added
just
wait
til
well
im
still
waiting
the
bottom
line
the
masterpiece
is
on
the
label
not
inside
the
bottle
even
so
its
still
a
drinkable
somewhat
enjoyable
version
of
an
often
overlooked
style
overall
an
excellent
ale
very
very
drinkable
well
worth
a
try
drinkable
and
tasty
a
very
good
belgian
amberbrown
tasted
average
to
below
average
for
an
amber
ale
i
couldnt
get
over
the
aluminum
taste
if
that
was
gone
it
would
be
ok
but
i
kept
tasting
bottle
cap
super
fizzy
makes
you
have
to
cringe
in
the
throat
sour
finish
not
one
ill
pursue
again
from
the
belgium
sampler
pack
11
2
oz
oddly
shaped
bottle
pours
a
handsome
clear
cherry
red
with
a
plentiful
tan
head
with
mixed
bubbles
that
fades
slowly
a
very
pretty
color
no
bubbles
or
visible
yeast
residue
nose
is
hard
to
place
definitely
not
a
typical
beer
odor
a
subdued
hint
of
hops
over
perhaps
a
hint
of
cheese
or
vomit
but
not
entirely
unpleasant
initial
taste
is
butteryfruity
type
of
fruit
is
debatable
i
say
apples
a
pointed
lack
of
acid
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
a
very
slight
iron
aftertaste
quite
drinkable
and
certainly
unusual
overall
above
average
drinkability
is
very
high
with
only
5
2
abv
and
great
flavor
blance
and
complexity
sir
may
i
have
another
bummer
not
surprisingly
this
beer
poors
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
sizeable
creamcolored
head
the
smell
is
extremely
faint
and
really
not
pronounced
enough
for
me
to
even
pick
anything
out
after
practically
dousing
my
nose
with
the
beers
head
i
catch
a
whiff
of
brown
sugar
and
yeast
its
subtle
the
taste
reminds
me
of
sour
apple
or
cranberry
backed
up
by
malt
that
hangs
on
the
tongue
as
an
aftertaste
pleasant
not
annoying
almost
portlike
this
is
a
new
beer
to
me
so
ill
have
to
drink
a
few
more
at
one
point
or
another
im
sure
ill
enjoy
it
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
ordering
a
few
more
of
these
drinkability
actually
pretty
good
i
guess
i
disagree
with
the
low
rating
overall
from
other
people
pours
a
muddied
amberlight
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
that
subsides
to
a
thin
collar
a
hint
of
sourness
amidst
a
toasty
malt
base
moderate
fruitiness
pretty
smooth
in
regards
to
its
light
mouthfeel
while
maintaining
an
average
body
light
suggestions
of
hard
cider
about
as
tasty
if
not
tastier
than
de
koninck
but
still
lacking
something
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
a
nice
light
belgian
ale
drinkability
my
first
of
about
6
van
steenberge
brews
i
have
waiting
to
try
odd
tasting
brew
that
will
take
a
few
to
get
used
to
just
plain
different
not
bad
though
i
may
try
it
again
down
the
road
i
guess
a
3
5
overall
does
this
beer
justice
its
a
fine
belgian
example
but
then
again
for
the
sake
of
a
generic
belgian
style
beer
there
are
better
choices
a
pleasant
enough
appearace
pouring
out
of
its
stubby
330ml
bottle
a
bright
fiery
copper
with
an
enormous
eruption
of
ivory
head
i
have
to
pour
a
bit
at
a
time
or
risk
overflow
at
least
three
fingers
worth
the
aroma
has
that
distinct
belgian
spiciness
yeasty
and
fruity
with
a
soft
sting
of
floral
hops
musty
belgian
malt
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
plenty
of
pear
and
banana
the
flavor
opens
up
muted
a
bit
lackluster
muddled
malt
toastiness
feels
a
little
weak
moving
aimlessly
into
a
fruity
middle
tinted
with
a
bit
of
honeyed
oxodization
decent
enough
pear
flavor
a
little
banana
sneaking
through
some
spiciness
from
the
yeast
a
bit
of
a
phenolic
cloviness
and
a
flicker
of
floral
hops
finishes
watery
and
weak
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
a
banana
peel
bitterness
way
back
in
the
aftertaste
some
cardboardy
dryness
with
strong
champagnelike
carbonation
decent
enough
to
try
once
but
nothing
id
go
back
to
unless
it
were
the
local
beer
its
possible
my
bottle
was
a
bit
old
but
i
got
it
at
a
reliable
place
aroma
is
pleasant
malty
slightly
tart
not
complex
flavor
is
sharper
more
hoppy
than
expected
but
balanced
with
slight
sweetness
tealike
astringency
good
beer
but
not
a
knockout
a
nice
little
belgain
beer
we
have
here
pretty
good
i
had
some
pretty
high
expectations
due
to
the
bottle
of
this
belgian
ale
and
i
was
kind
of
let
down
bruegel
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
virtually
no
head
but
a
thin
line
of
foam
around
the
glass
i
got
this
from
the
330ml
stubby
bottle
the
smell
was
wheat
and
malt
with
hints
of
honey
chocolate
and
nuts
the
taste
was
similar
but
no
chocolate
was
detected
i
felt
there
was
too
much
carbonation
in
the
mouth
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
woww
first
one
from
van
steenberge
that
pours
out
just
fine
enormous
head
and
lasting
bronze
color
makes
the
looks
more
then
al
right
nose
is
litle
malty
but
mostly
sour
and
unpleasand
taste
is
ruined
by
the
ernormous
amount
of
co2
sour
en
tasting
like
its
been
infeted
by
an
high
fermenting
no
brett
yeast
hardly
any
hops
at
the
end
so
just
a
sour
taste
hanging
for
quiet
some
time
might
otherwise
be
ok
but
for
tonight
a
pour
out
pours
a
amberorange
colour
with
a
frothy
white
head
good
lacing
body
is
clear
some
fruit
and
spice
in
the
nose
taste
was
alright
some
malty
sweetness
fruit
diacetyl
hints
of
caramel
finish
is
dry
could
use
a
little
more
balance
but
overall
a
drinkable
ale
modestly
hazy
ambergold
in
hue
with
significant
tawny
influences
the
liquid
is
polluted
with
bubbles
there
is
an
insane
amount
of
carbonation
racing
towards
the
oversized
offwhite
head
i
couldnt
fit
all
the
beer
in
the
goblet
due
to
the
massive
head
easily
there
is
three
fingers
worth
of
foam
in
a
moment
the
head
faded
to
a
moderate
cap
that
lasted
the
entire
consumption
there
was
tons
of
subsequent
lacing
massive
globs
of
residue
overall
the
appearance
is
pleasant
the
nose
doesnt
say
much
all
i
get
is
lightly
spiced
marshmallows
with
some
equally
light
fruity
notes
tropical
in
nature
hints
of
toasted
caramel
too
i
like
what
i
smell
but
i
need
way
more
aroma
and
complexity
for
me
to
deem
this
beer
inviting
simplistic
the
palate
is
yawn
inducing
i
drink
and
i
drink
i
think
and
i
think
what
do
i
taste
anything
of
note
i
sense
some
sweetness
like
marshmallows
there
are
some
soft
spicy
notes
basically
nondescript
however
orange
peel
there
is
some
bittersweet
candy
that
ends
on
a
dry
note
there
seems
to
be
a
very
weak
suggestion
of
caramel
fruity
flavors
are
characterless
light
bitterness
the
modest
level
of
alcohol
is
hidden
as
it
should
be
cleaner
than
id
like
where
is
the
dirty
yeasty
funk
basically
this
beer
is
a
session
ale
belgianstyle
that
is
cool
i
suppose
but
this
beer
doesnt
impress
me
much
it
is
too
bland
for
me
to
be
compelled
to
drink
more
than
one
of
maybe
this
beer
would
be
better
suited
some
other
time
maybe
not
the
palate
on
the
whole
is
fair
medium
in
body
creamy
filling
carbonation
that
produces
a
mouthfeel
that
is
enjoyable
but
its
nothing
special
it
does
fit
this
beer
well
though
drinkable
sure
i
guess
i
mean
why
drink
it
a
session
beer
should
have
more
flavor
period
a
low
abv
is
a
must
done
a
tasty
quaff
is
a
must
too
not
done
no
matter
how
i
look
at
this
beer
it
is
just
okay
nothing
more
nothing
less
honestly
i
dont
dislike
it
yet
i
dont
like
it
either
i
was
so
unimpressed
i
finished
my
glass
with
a
bologna
sandwich
it
is
an
average
beverage
i
purchased
this
bottle
as
part
of
a
samplerpack
in
ames
ia
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
3
light
tan
head
snoconing
above
glass
rim
over
the
very
effervescent
amber
brew
head
lasts
a
long
long
time
and
laces
with
huge
hunks
of
foam
most
everywhere
somewhat
generic
spicy
belgian
aroma
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
but
doesnt
set
itself
apart
taste
is
upfront
a
bit
tart
fading
to
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
excellent
so
drinkable
once
the
head
comes
down
to
earth
overall
above
average
amber
ale
that
drinks
well
good
for
what
it
is
essentially
a
belgian
session
ale
pours
an
amber
with
and
off
white
head
that
has
good
retention
but
doesnt
lace
much
aroma
of
caramel
and
some
lighter
malts
almost
like
an
english
bitter
taste
was
some
malts
caramel
slightly
tart
with
a
clean
hoppy
finish
rather
thin
mouthfeel
again
like
a
bitter
rather
good
id
drink
a
few
if
i
had
them
but
compared
to
other
things
this
brewery
has
to
offer
id
rather
move
on
this
is
a
finely
balanced
belgian
amber
which
is
really
rather
drinkable
on
any
occasion
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
and
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
too
sour
for
my
liking
although
the
hops
really
started
to
come
out
as
it
warmed
up
330ml
belgian
stubbie
bottle
this
ale
poured
a
reddish
orange
with
a
tight
off
white
frothy
cap
that
retains
well
fruity
boquet
in
the
nose
some
slight
sweet
and
sour
effects
medium
bodied
sweet
without
cloying
and
a
distinct
tartpeppery
apricot
tone
to
the
taste
mingles
with
doughy
malts
finishes
well
going
dry
and
a
tad
bitter
certainly
one
of
the
more
drinkable
belgian
ales
with
a
nice
unique
taste
pours
a
copper
orange
color
with
a
good
head
and
plenty
of
lace
patches
the
aroma
is
malty
with
bran
notes
of
all
things
it
actually
kind
of
smells
like
raison
bran
cereal
the
taste
is
also
quite
branlike
with
some
caramel
and
diacytel
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
little
bland
with
only
subdued
hop
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
very
smooth
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
this
beer
is
ok
but
a
bit
wanting
in
the
flavor
department
wow
this
little
belgian
pale
surprised
me
absolutely
lovable
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
from
the
massive
overcarbonation
but
the
patience
is
more
than
worth
the
trouble
this
has
an
excellent
meld
of
flavors
and
i
plan
to
stock
up
on
a
few
of
these
low
hops
and
low
alcohol
make
this
a
poor
candidate
for
cellaring
but
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
every
day
very
light
amber
with
a
gorgeous
creamy
head
that
last
a
long
time
light
malt
presence
in
the
smell
with
some
light
fruity
elements
also
a
bit
of
a
witbier
aroma
was
present
taste
is
light
with
a
smooth
malt
presence
that
ends
in
a
beautifully
dry
finish
that
leaves
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
is
refreshing
very
smooth
on
the
drinkability
scale
a
very
nice
brew
overall
a
good
beer
comes
in
a
33ml
brown
bottle
part
of
a

the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
good
it
is
light
and
goes
down
easy
the
flavor
is
a
little
tart
along
with
a
light
amount
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
belgian
amber
the
flavor

malty
flavor
is
malty
without
much
sweetness
bitterness
is
minimal
but
provides
a
very
crisp

finish
spicy
throughout
and
the
sensation
is
amplified
by
the
strong
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
light
but
overall
the
beer
is
very
drinkable

wow
this
is
a
tasty
little
amber
ale
from
belgium
the
plate
of
grapes
apple
and
mild
cheeses
went
great
with
this
brew
certainly
more
of
a
pairing

rather
than
a

not
a
bad
belgian
pale
this
beer
came
across
as
tinny
tasting
there
were
some
hints
of
what
you
would
expect
from
a
decent
belgian

a
little
spiciness
some
fruit

but
not
enough
to
redeem
the
beer
kind
of
a
shame
cause
it
actually
looked
pretty
good

this

floatbrownish
amber
in

i
cant
tell
much
about
the
nose
as
the
head
is
so
thick
and
dense
that
the
aromas
cant
break
through
clean
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
only
moderate
levels
of
flavorodd
i
get
some
malt
a
faint
spice
note
and
some
dilute
breadlike
flavors
but
there
really
is
not
much
going
on
here
there
is
very
little
in
the
way
of
hop
character
a
pleasant
enough
beverage
but
nothing
inspiring
here
pours
a
cloudy
light
copper
hue
under
a
big
contoured
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
but
not
much
lace
the
nose
is
light
and
fruity
sweet
while
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
light
the
taste
is
classic
francophone
sweet
with
fruits
and
spices
that
mask
the
malt
and
hops
masking
out
two
of
the
core
ingredients
of
beer
is
not
a

thing
in

the

is

is

a

taste
is
very
complex
but
a
little
muted
again
tastes
a
little
like
a
cider
but
more
of
a
burnt
flavor
this
was
in
a
belgian

pack
and
if
this
is
the
quality

all
beers
in

it

this

sort

this

is
a
mixture
of
a
pale

hefeweisen
in

not
that

is
almost
violent
with
that
fizzy

on
the

drinkability

this
went
down
in
typical
belgian
fashion
it
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
had
expected
but
a
good
ale
nevertheless
im
disappointed
with
this
beer
great
looking
not
so
in
the
taste
department
pop
the
top
and
you
had
better
be
ready
with
your
glass
on
this
one
it
pours
to
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
thick
rocky
tan
head
the
aroma
is
clean
with
a
smell
of
flowers
and
fresh
cut
hay
the
flavor
is
clean
and
floral
with
herbs
it
is
herbalmedicinal
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
it
is
very
light
and
easy
drinking
a
tasty
light
flavored
beer
a
very
good
brew
this
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
sweet
the
taste
was
malty
and
sweet
the
malts
stick
with
you
throught
the
aftertaste
very
nice
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
if
i
can
find
it
a
nice
albeit
fairly
average
amber
what
it
lacks
in
its
appearance
and
overall
dimension
of
character
it
makes
up
with
its
drinkability
the
crisp
refreshing
and
basic
flavours
are
welcome
the
amber
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
a
haze
the
head
was
lighter
than
expected
but
remained
constant
throughout
the
sample
and
laced
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
sweet
yeasty
aroma
was
strong
for
an
amber
thin
malt
flavor
but
it
lasted
on
the
tongue
the
yeast
flavor
was
a
little
too
strong
even
though
i
took
care
to
not
pour
the
sediment
into
the
sample
good
carbonation
overall
the
amber
scored
lower
than
expected
but
i
will
sample
again
in
the
future
medium

color
large
head
aroma
is

very

somewhat
spicy
bright

clean
taste
mild
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
aftertaste

it
drinks
well
it
is
crisp
and
it
finishes
quite
well
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
first
of
all
stand
back
from
this
bad
boy
when
you
pop
the
top
lest
you
be
eaten
by
the
blob
this
monster
produced
one
of
the
biggest
most
unstoppable
heads
of
ivory
foam
ive
ever
seen
just
would
not
stop
and
it
took
nearly
ten
minutes
to
get
it
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
great
yeasty
and
malty
with
a
few
caramel
and
fruit
notes
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
tend
to
be
a
bit
tart
and
yeasty
decent
enough
but
not
aweinspiring
somewhat
thin
on
body
and
fairly
drinkable
a
decent
ale
to
try
again
down
the
road
its
unique
for
the
style
and
worth
trying
for
posteritys
sake
nothing
much
stands
out
here
except
for
the
carbonation
level
which
can
lower
drinkability
if
you
consider
how
many
of
those
bubbles
will
be
dancing
on
your
head
in
the
morning
pour
very
slowly
it
was
very
foamy
which
had
a
hazy
yellow
orange
color
and
loads
of
tight
foam
and
heavy
retention
from
start
to
finish
on
side
of
glass
the
smell
of
yeast
with
a
since
of
a
brut
champagne
the
taste
was
not
fruity
but
had
an
contemplative
bouquet
firm
body
profound
hop
bitterness
and
a
short
dry
finish
i
must
of
moved
the
bottle
too
much
because
it
opened
as
a
boy
beer
nice
mix
in
aroma
a
yeastiness
slight
malt
and
some
phenol
jason
noted
juicey
fruit
which
a
caught
a
whiff
of
big
full
head
attractive
appearance
of
amber
with
orange
mostly
clear
with
some
slight
cloudiness
flavor
has
many
of
the
same
qualities
as
the
aroma
esp
the
yeasty
quality
banana
with
the
phenol
enough
malt
backing
with
a
short
slightly
dry
finish
their
is
a
thinness
to
it
thats
unusual
for
where
it
came
from
makes
it
easier
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
improved
with
nice
contribution
of
carbonation
and
softness
nonetheless
enough
complexity
to
qualify
as
a
decent
belgian
just
there
are
others
that
are
much
better
overall
still
several
of
these
could
make
a
fine
evening
a
clear
dark
ambercopper
body
is
topped
by
a
full
pillowy
white
head
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
keeps
a
thin
creamy
surface
covering
throughout
the
goblet
the
nose
is
pleasantly
yeasty
somewhat
earthy
and
a
touch
fruity
its
light
body
is
boosted
by
a
vibrant
carbonation
its
lightly
zesty
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
becomes
a
bit
creamier
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
the
flavor
is
softly
malty
with
a
bitterness
that
makes
itself
known
but
goes
no
further
perfectly
balancing
the
beer
and
leaving
a
refreshingly
dry
finish
a
good
example
of
a
basic
belgian
pale
ale
thats
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
one
that
may
seem
thin
when
compared
to
others
pours
with
a
fierce
head
took
ten
minutes
just
to
empty
the
bottle
head
is
thick
and
frothy
but
leaves
little
lace
cloudy
yellow
color
not
at
all
amber
looking
quiet
tasting
light
malt
and
light
hoppiness
not
bad
but
disappointing
for
a
belgian
on
my
second
visit
with
this
beer
my
opinions
didnt
change
much
i
discerned
a
fruitiness
in
the
finish
found
the
palate
to
be
smooth
and
refreshing
and
complimented
the
balance
moreover
i
recognized
the
folly
in
my
facetious
remark
and
realized
the
beer
for
what
it
is
meant
to
be
a
light
peasant
beer
your
partys
over
pretty
quick
if
your
beer
is
something
like
gulden
drak
and
same
for
your
aspirin
supply
of
course
they
drank
a
lot
of
it
theyre
revellers
at
least
they
had
better
beer
than
youd
find
at
a
contemporary
american
house
party
where
youre
likely
to
guzzle
on
a
high
life
or
sumpin
a
great
looking
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
huge
custardlike
head
my
daughter
walked
into
the
room
right
after
i
poured
saw
the
beer
and
said
ice
cream
i
keep
a
long
handled
spoon
with
an
opener
on
the
other
end
by
my
computer
and
she
grabbed
it
in
hopes
of
getting
a
spoonful
on
the
head
yeasty
aroma
at
the
front
followed
by
fruity
apple
notes
smells
a
lot
like
a
heffeweisse
pretty
light
tasting
fruity
with
a
slight
bitterness
cloves
are
present
too
very
hefelike
decent
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
for
monumental
fruity
nose
dominated
by
fresh
lime
but
carrying
hints
of
berries
and
apple
the
lime
is
hauled
into
the
draught
but
is
soon
unloaded
to
make
room
for
a
pleasant
malt
and
hop
balance
that
lingers
until
you
push
your
face
into
the
glass
anew
charged
not
choking
and
strikingly
unique
pours
a
light
copperorange
colour
topped
by
a
thick
beautifull
head
this
beer
has
an
excellent
appearance
but
i
think
that
thats
just
it
its
a
shame
really
such
a
beautiful
beer
to
be
killed
by
the
taste
and
aroma
taste
and
aroma
are
average
and
maybe
below
average
in
comparison
with
other
european
pale
ales
brewery
van
steenberge
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
known
breweries
worldwide
and
im
surprised
that
this
beer
comes
under
this
brewery
and
again
this
is
just
my
humble
opinion
i
dont
want
to
take
anyone
with
me
true
to
its
name
this
beer
is
an
extremely
attractive
amber
in
color
mostly
clear
very
well
carbonated
with
a
mediumsized
slightly
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
and
slightly
tart
hints
of
yeast
flavor
demonstrates
good
hop
presence
from
start
to
finish
overripe
strawberries
and
a
milt
malt
sweetness
come
in
midpalate
with
a
slightly
dry
but
balanced
finish
and
a
pleasant
bready
aftertaste
effervescence
gives
this
a
mediumlight
seeming
body
i
grow
fonder
of
this
beer
the
longer
i
let
it
warm
and
by
the
end
am
quite
ready
for
another
a
great
looking
beer

it

the
metallic
taste
lingers
for
a

and
makes
you
reach
for
something
to
help
get
the
taste
out
of
your
mouth
bit
of
a
letdown
after
such
a
lovely
appearance
disappointing
the
color
and
it
pours
from
the
bottle
unclouded
amber
with
a
planetary
sized
head
that
is

belgians
out
there
beautiful

in

perhaps
too
much

nice

begin
to
make
my
mouth
water
the
taste
however
isnt
that
great
its
not
bad
but
like
a
few
others
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
for
lack
of
a
better
word
its
a
bit
bland
really
has
a
very
light
tart
and
fruity
taste
with
a
very
dry
but
slightly
spicy
and
metallic
finish
all
of
that
carbonation
gives
this
brew
a
very
rough
and
almost
acidic
feel
on
the
tongue
its
certainly
a
drinkable
brew
but
even
if
i
had
another
i
think
id
reach
for
something
else
this
amberorange
brew
throws
a
nice
dense
rocky
head
that
is
well
retained
belgian
lace
is
nice
the
nose
consists
of
yeasty
breadiness
and
herbal
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
almost
like
a
champagne
body
is
light
to
medium
and
the
taste
is
very
neutral
i
like
the
spice
touch
seems
to
be
spiced
similar
to
a
wit
orange
curacao
and
corriander
also
get
a
slight
toasted
quality
with
subtle
yeast
tones
present
also
the
drinkability
factor
is
pretty
average
due
to
the
high
carbonation
bruegel
ale
great
looking
beer
with
deep
copper
haze
and
a
huge
huge

three
inches
over
the
rim
nice

aroma
not
overstated
i
liked
this
beer
had
nice

sweetness
with
citrus
flavors
in
the
deep
background
and
a
clean
dry
finish
golden
abber
in
color
lots
of

small

and
a

sweet
yeasty

the
taste
disappoints
in
relation
to
the
appearence
not
much
body
and
it
lacks
the
yeast
character
other
begians
have
there
is
also
a
slight
metalic
finish
to
the
taste
this
brew
misses
the
mark
final
grade
3
65
a
b
grade
augustijn
blond
is
a
decent
beer
but
still
not
a
very
notable
one
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
while
the
flavour
profile
is
suitable
and
not
at
all
offensive
this
still
strikes
me
as
a
forgettable
belgian
pale
ale
there
just
isnt
anything
jumping
out
at
me
about
this
one
for
better
or
worse
id
certainly
consider
having
this
beer
again
and
would
consider
it
at
least
worth
a
shot
but
dont
expect
anything
more
than
a
serviceable
belgian
blonde
enjoy
not
in
love
but
i
dont
dislike
it
i
like
the
fruity
aroma
but
it
tastes
to
much
like
a
white
wine
or
an
average
pils
at
room
temp
you
would
think
you
are
drinking
a
pilsener
urquell
forgettable
a
powerful
brew
in
the
grand
tradition
with
all
the
belgian
characteristics
more
of
a
brew
to
sip
respectfully
its
hard
to
take
too
much
of
this
with
that
cloying
cake
taste
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
ibis
market
in
mission
hills
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
at
best
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
the
style
it
didnt
really
have
an
aspect
that
set
it
apart
from
all
the
other
average
belgian
blonde
ales
and
there
wasnt
any
aspect
about
it
that
i
thought
was
really
well
done
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
very
crisp
pretty
prickly
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
interest
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
i
figured
that
out
before
i
got
half
way
through
the
bottle
the
sweetness
and
super
high
carbonation
would
prevent
me
from
even
thinking
about
drinking
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
seemed
to
be
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
and
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
they
both
need
to
be
toned
down
a
good
amount
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
either
its
not
hard
to
find
a
much
better
belgian
blonde
ale
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
one
it
just
didnt
have
what
it
takes
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
it
was
hard
for
me
to
get
over
how
prickly
it
was
i
think
this
is
now
one
of
my
least
favorite
belgian
blonde
ales
piraat
is
still
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
now
my
least
favorite
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
overall
this
is
the
first
belgian
pale
ale
ive
ever
tried
but
the
alcohol
aftertaste
just
grosses
me
out
overall
its
a
good
but
unspectacular
belgian
pale
ale
would
much
rather
move
up
the
weight
class
a
bit
into
strong
belgian
pale
ales
and
have
one
of
those
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
but
i
didnt
need
to
get
outlandishly
tipsy
drinking
it
in
the
process
the
extra
alcohol
no
doubt
provides
more
sweetness
to
the
flavor
but
the
yeasty
phenols
and
grains
are
good
enough
that
they
could
do
without
it
regardless
this
aged
quite
well
in
the
past
8
months
but
perhaps
its
even
better
fresh
as
it
lacks
a
dynamic
dry
hopped
presence
i
enjoy
in
the
style
an
odd
belgian
pale
to
say
the
least
normally
its
a
clean
style
but
this
one
was
not
that
overall
quite
a
nice
belgian
blonde
ale
here
funky
yeast
copious
malt
good
flavors
and
feel
the
bottle
now
states
this
beer
is
8
abv
and
thats
the
reward
for
paying
the
price
a
perfect
beer
on
a
sunny
sunday
afternoon
to
taste
90100
d
a
decent
beer
especially
for
style
a
solid
table
brew
best
served
with
a
meal
rjt
overall
a
solid
and
spicy
blonde
with
wellhidden
abv
that
lacks
the
complexity
and
refinement
of
the
best
belgian
alternatives
o
decent
bpa
not
my
favorite
but
worthy
of
a
try
overall
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
found
the
flavor
a
bit
boring
the
mouthfeel
definitely
helped
in
delivering
a
better
than
average
good
belgian
brew
that
said
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
id
look
to
buy
again
overall
balanced
refreshing
overall
a
very
nice
and
balanced
ale
bitterness
is
present
in
a
malty
environement
it
is
a
belgium
refreshing
beer
too
o
kind
of
an
oddity
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
surprising
attention
getter
in
the
van
steenberg
sampler
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
goblet
no
bottled
date
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
light
brown
color
with
a
massive
off
white
head
which
is
slowly
dissipating
right
now
this
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
a
little
citrus
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonination
the
taste
is
okay
like
many
of
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
it
suffers
from
a
high
alcohol
content
which
isnt
well
masked
and
gives
this
a
certain
boozy
taste
under
that
you
get
some
nice
citrus
like
hop
bite
a
dry
finish
not
bad
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
slight
pepper
bite
coating
my
throat
and
wellintegrated
alcohol
very
fine
11
2oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
translucent
goldenorange
with
a
rocky
two
inch
bright
white
head
that
slowly
collapses
in
on
itself
head
eventually
settles
into
a
frothy
cap
with
thick
textured
clusters
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
tangerines
and
a
suggestion
of
candi
sugar
theres
also
a
trace
of
clove
and
a
slight
metallic
quality
taste
is
somewhat
bland
and
also
reveals
a
wet
cardboard
character
as
well
as
a
bit
of
grassiness
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
lively
palate
cleansing
carbonation
and
a
light
acidity
overall
a
fairly
lackluster
bspa
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
again
o
every
single
one
of
these
augustijn
beers
are
so
so
good
i
highly
recommend
each
one
of
them
just
such
a
treat
and
this
one
is
especially
good
solid
effort
prefer
american
bspas
though
o
good
solid
belgian
would
drink
again
its
pretty
good
and
gets
the
good
done
and
although
it
can
be
complex
at
times
this
didnt
come
across
as
aweinspiring
nice
with
a
good
body
and
refreshing
would
have
it
again
but
no
reason
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
more
especially
not
at
the
price
i
got
it
at
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
considering
they
call
it
a
blonde
has
more
and
better
tastes
than
most
blondes
around
here
well
blonde
beers
anyway
overall
reminds
me
of
gouden
carolus
tripel
however
perhaps
not
as
complex
or
defined
nice
tropical
fruits
can
be
noted
in
this
beer
when
paying
attention
fairly
smooth
more
in
the
style
of
a
tripel
to
me
than
a
blond
per
se
but
still
great
nonetheless
definitely
worth
buying
again
overall
a
4
its
8
abv
least
thats
what
my
bottle
says
and
is
great
for
sipping
and
enjoying
the
turn
of
the
seasons
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
mild
grass
and
hay
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
grain
grass
hay
and
some
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
pretty
refreshing
pretty
light
feeling
with
the
high
carbonation
there
is
just
enough
stickiness
to
it
though
a
good
middle
to
slightly
above
example
nothing
to
complain
about
nothing
to
rave
about
worth
trying
i
dont
know
if
id
have
more
than
2
or
3
in
a
sitting
but
that
would
be
plenty
this
might
be
a
good
beer
to
end
a
night
with
a
sipping
beer
for
after
work
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
not
the
type
of
thing
i
drink
often
so
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
a
well
made
beer
the
overall
taste
acomplishes
my
expectations
but
it
is
not
the
best
belgian
pale
ale
that
ive
tasted
i
did
not
expect
that
this
beer
would
be
this
balanced
and
smooth
although
not
very
special
this
beer
is
decent
and
worth
seeking
out
goldenbrown
body
slightly
hazy
with
a
large
puff
of
foamy
white
head
bready
aroma
notes
of
candi
sugar
and
light
citrus
zest
the
aroma
follows
into
the
taste
light
pale
bready
malts
citrus
zest
herbal
hops
rock
candy
light
banana
esters
decent
but
a
bit
thin
overall
lightmedium
body
a
bit
sticky
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
a
decent
drinker
but
nothing
tremendous
very
light
brew
that
could
be
consumed
anytime
not
a
bad
beer
just
looking
for
a
bit
more
aroma
and
taste
i
would
buy
it
again
if
my
options
were
limited
overall
this
was
a
nice
belgian
pale
nothing
earth
shattering
but
complex
and
drinkable
recommended
to
any
ba
looking
to
branch
out
into
the
world
of
belgian
beer
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
variety
pack
cheers
overall
very
good
beer
beer
is
somehwat
of
as
hybrid
cross
between
a
trippel
and
blonde
but
overall
i
like
it
and
i
think
so
would
you
salud
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
color
was
that
of
apple
juice
but
cloudy
the
white
sudsy
head
lasted
throughout
most
of
the
tasting
the
nose
immediately
reminded
me
of
a
leffe
blonde
another
belgian
pale
there
is
a
yeastiness
to
the
nose
nose
with
a
mild
sour
edge
having
been
warned
of
the
sourness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
beer
quite
balanced
the
yeast
and
light
sour
flavors
were
well
countered
with
just
the
right
degree
of
hops
looks
like
a
blonde
ale
has
the
salty
taste
of
a
tripel
and
the
violently
ballooning
head
of
a
wheat
beer
check
your
belgian
expectations
at
the
fridge
door
and
youll
do
fine
with
this
bottle
dont
expect
much
fizz
which
is
good
dont
expect
much
bite
it
could
use
a
bit
more
and
dont
expect
to
drink
it
quickly
because
you
have
to
wait
for
the
dense
head
to
dissipate
do
let
it
get
warm
as
that
brings
out
the
fruityness
that
is
so
remarkable
about
this
beer
not
bad
for
a
single
overall
not
bad
the
flavors
are
there
though
a
bit
flawed
very
worth
a
try
though
not

favorite

rather
approachable
very
good
to
share
socially
and
engage
people
in
quality
brews
i
confess
im
holding
a
jeroboam
of
this
for
something
next
week
and
i
think
it
should
work
really
well
aroma
is
of
fruits
taste
is
strong
fruity
and
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
traceable
very
pleasantly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
quite
carbonated
overall
a
really
great
beer
simply
superb
clear
burnished
gold
with
a
monstrous
lump
of
white
foam
that
clung
to
the
tulip
glass
for
the
entire
drinking
session
intense
carbonation
kept
it
light
and
lively
the
whole
way
through
bright
and
complex
flavors
abound
vanilla
banana
rosewater
lemon
rind
and
easter
grass
smooooth
i
mean
really
silky
smooth
but
dry
as
a
bone
and
endlessly
drinkable
the
stuff
slid
down
the
gullet
with
ease
maybe
the
mood
struck
me
just
right
but
goddamn
this
was
a
really
standout
belgian
ale
without
reservation
this
is
probably
the
second
most
beautiful
looking
beer
on
the
planet
big
ole
thick
creamy
head
looks
like
whipped
cream
was
added
from
the
middle
of
the
brew
orgasmic
a
little
tart
on
the
taste
not
oft
style
very
grainy
and
gritty
straw
pale
looking
appearance
also
a
bit
sour
however
which
is
somewhat
unattractive
medium
bodied
very
crisp
just
a
bit
too
astringently
fruity
on
the
back
a
definite
keeper
feels
light
slightly
dry
and
clean
with
a
medium
tingling
nothing
special
here
i
like
this
one
more
than
a
great
many
of
the
blondes
ive
had
but
this
is
far
from
a
style
i
really
seek
out
worth
a
try
to
say
you
had
it
but
nothing
ill
come
back
to

tingle
to

we
find
this

to
be

we
can
drink
this
ooverall
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
belgian
ale
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
ale
but
not
the
best
ive
had
its
quite
forgettable
at
the
end
of
the
day
atmosphere
is
decent
large
cascading
head
but
not
much
in
terms
of
lacing
nose
is
mostly
defined
by
its
yeasty
nature
but
a
little
balance
with
a
sweet
herbal
tone
flavor
is
pungent
and
yeasty
but
not
offputting
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
abv

i
just
love
this
one
through
and
through
md
softly
carbonated
smooth
on
the
palate
which
goes
well
with
the
retrained
flavour
profile
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
showing
a
really
decent
understatedquiet
flavour
better
than
augustijn
brune
in
terms
of
overall
performance
balance
imo
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
pale
ale
overall
a
very
nice
belgian
i
have
had
it
several
times
and
it
is
always
enjoyable
fun
to
drink
out
a
giant
bottle
a
fine
belgian
beer
overall
its
a
solid
and
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
great
for
the
summer
but
certainly
enjoyable
any
time
of
year
nice
lighter
body
with
refreshing
attributes
and
an
abv
that
has
a
presence
but
isnt
overwhelming
or
anything
feels
good
in
the
mouth
just
a
bit
above
average
a
decent
belgian
blonde
but
it
wont
change
your
life
the
complex
yeasty
characteristics
are
ok
but
it
has
an
acrid
undertone
that
spoils
the
flavour
worthy
drinkability
great
belgian
blonde
and
not
overly
sweet
important
to
me
d
quite
drinkable
o
a
good
beer
but
not
great
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
certainly
worth
a
try
doesnt
stand
out
belgium
produces
enough
beers
that
one
could
live
there
and
drink
a
beer
every
day
and
go
well
over
two
years
without
ever
having
to
drink
the
same
beer
twice
my
suggestion
is
you
skip
over
augustijn
blond
for
both
brouwerij
van
steenberges
and
the
rest
of
the
countrys
other
better
offerings
after
tonight
i
surely
doubt
ill
have
it
again
d
could
drink
these
guys
all
day
d
well
the
initial
taste
is
pleasant
the
finish
is
inoffensive
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
having
said
that
i
dont
like
the
mouthfeel
and
i
find
the
flavor
falls
off
a
cliff
way
too
quickly
drink
an
above
average
beer
that
i
enjoyed
it
seems
to
be
lacking
just
a
little
bit
of
balance
but
its
still
good
nonetheless
super
easy
to
drink
you
dont
even
feel
the
abv
on
this
at
all
goes
down
so
easy
what
a
great
style
this
is
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
brewery
mix
6
pack
from
the
lcbo
in
ontario
pours
a
goldenorange
colour
with
huge
white
head
i
had
to
wait
for
the
head
to
dissipate
somewhat
to
actually
drink
this
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
grassy
with
belgian
yeast
quite
a
dry
flavour
very
understated
sweetness
no
bitterness
at
all
really
low
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
which
is
surprising
given
how
much
head
there
was
dit
has
this
distinct
plastic
taste
that
makes
drinking
it
not
all
that
fun
but
its
not
bad
enough
to
make
drinking
it
turn
in
to
a
pain
i
dont
know
if
i
had
to
i
might
be
able
to
drink
more
of
this
but
not
if
i
have
choices
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
one
i
am
glad
i
tried
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
to
find
again
pretty
straightforward
bpa
yeast
dominates
with
spicy
cloves
hints
of
apple
and
citrus
zest
lemon
light
grassy
hop
finish
grainy
malt
with
a
hint
of
bubblegum
juicy
and
round
in
the
beginning
with
a
bone
dry
finish
carbonation
is
through
the
roof
like
swarms
of
tiny
needles
in
your
mouth
makes
it
hard
to
pick
out
flavors
this
is
a
pretty
simple
ale
with
one
major
flaw
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
its
own
d
lacks
complexity
but
a
good
belgian
pale
this
is
a
decent
belgian
blonde
ale
along
the
lines
of
duvel
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
likely
buy
again
d
a
solid
example
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
really
stands
out
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
bpa
fix
this
one
definitely
wont
let
you
down
the
7
is
almost
invisible
and
its
a
fine
drinker
the
initial
opinion
of
this
wasnt
too
bad
it
had
alot
of
your
run
of
the
mill
belgian
pale
notes
but
the
weird
aftertaste
wore
me
down
and
made
it
a
bit
of
a
struggle
to
finish
poured
from
a
brown
stubby
330
ml
bottle
into
my
affligem
chalice
it
was
a
windy
day
and
i
was
afraid
the
fluffy
head
would
take
off
it
laced
nicely
and
was
a
rich
dark
golden
hue
that
was
extremely
cloudy
smell
is
yeasty
fruity
and
lightly
malted
taste
is
like
a
loaf
of
bread
with
honey
wheat
and
pears
mouth
feel
is
wonderful
a
medium
bodied
blonde
which
is
not
too
common
drinkability
is
good
but
at
7
abv
tread
lightly
the
bottle
gave
me
a
best
before
of

final
thoughts
i
really
dont
know
what
they
were
trying
to
go
for
with
this
one
the
problem
here
is
it
has
a
standard
belgian
pale
flavour
but
with
a
much
higher
abv
typical
of
a
strong
belgian
pale
or
a
tripel
it
seems
that
there
is
too
much
yeast
and
it
has
gobbled
up
all
the
flavour
to
make
that
high
alcohol
taste
which
isnt
being
masked
well
enough
by
the
rest
of
the
beer
im
gonna
say
youll
want
to
pass
on
this
one
330
ml
stubby
bottle
bought
at
voldby
købmandsgård
denmark
abv
is
now
7
seems
to
vary
quite
a
bit
pale
yellow
colour
slightly
hazy
huge
and
white
head
lasts
forever
fairly
nice
aroma
of
spices
and
belgian
ale
yeast
the
flavour
is
mildly
spicy
with
moderate
notes
of
white
candi
sugar
not
too
sweet
quite
nice
moderate
hops
light
bodied
for
its
strength
alcohol
is
well
hidden
pleasant
to
drink
d
an
easy
drinking
belgian
pale
ale
with
a
muted
flavour
profile
on
the
tongue
but
refreshing
in
the
dry
finish
a
nice
example
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
open
for
this
again
overall
a
decent
belgian
pale
ale
but
nothing
fantastic
the
pronounced
notes
of
leather
and
medicinal
phenols
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
were
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
and
didnt
seem
to
have
any
qualities
to
bounce
it
back
from
this
for
me
down
in
ontario
this
beer
is
only
available
in
the
belgian
mixed
6
pack
its
one
of
the
weaker
offerings
of
the
set
but
the
pack
is
still
worth
picking
up
for
the
other
bottles
in
it
pours
a
humongous
slightly
offwhite
head
big
frothy
bubbles
somewhat
lasting
body
is
a
clear
burnt
yellow
color
bubbly
very
fruity
floral
aroma
light
fruit
like
apple
pear
very
strong
pear
aroma
sweet
smelling
very
light
taste
some
light
fruit
a
hint
of
floralness
white
grapes
and
pears
perhaps
refreshing
watery
palate
mediumbodied
with
fine
carbonation
feels
crisp
an
approachable
and
simple
pale
ale
from
belgium
very
tasty
light
hop
close
another
solid
brew
augie
blond
is
a
very
nice
belgian
pale
ale
it
is
not
over
carbonated
which
i
prefer
unlike
so
many
of
the
belgians
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
ale
but
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
for
me
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
shaped
pint
glass
pours
semi
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
sweet
grain
and
belgian
yeast
tastes
of
sweet
grain
with
almost
a
taste
of
corn
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
light
bodied
nice
finish
overall
an
above
average
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
decent
mix
of
character
that
i
wasnt
crazy
about
but
the
hops
kinda
worked
with
the
yeasty
spice
since
it
wasnt
too
bitter
overall
a
nice
beer
not
the
best
of
style
but
a
very
drikable
beer
overall
nice
belgian
ale
recommended
this
is
a
nice
version
of
a
fruity
esp
banana
mildly
spicy
bpa
o
very
nice
bpa
knockoff
not
quite
in
the
same
league
as
duvel
but
a
hell
of
a
lot
less
money
and
just
as
enjoyable
to
drink
another
well
made
beer
from
ng
overall
stone
soup
is
my
new
favorite
from
new
glarus
as
the
alt
isnt
around
anymore
and
i
can
only
hope
that
limited
distribution
brings
this
wonderful
brew
out
west
otherwise
im
going
to
need
a
bigger
bag
coming
back
next
time
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
pillowy
white
head
nose
is
spicy
with
strong
belgian
yeast
character
notes
of
lemon
cracker
clove
and
coriander
all
come
through
flavor
is
spicy
and
features
plenty
of
belgian
pale
characteristics
on
point
for
style
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
pretty
straightforward
beer
here
not
on
the
level
of
something
like
duvel
but
well
balanced
and
flavorful
nonetheless
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
no
complaints
here
but
there
usually
arent
any
with
new
glarus
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
mostly
smooth
slightly
foamy
mouthfeel
thats
not
correct
for
the
style
more
carbonation
for
style
but
fits
with
this
beer
well
enough
closes
dry
with
substantial
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
lighter
belgian
style
ale
good
yeasty
taste
with
some
nice
fruit
and
malt
notes
o
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
i
dont
quite
like
it
as
much
as
dancing
man
or
the
most
recent
thumbprint
imperial
weizen
but
its
very
tasty
none
the
less
prost
overall
this
is
the
closest
thing
to
the
real
deal
as
opposed
to
weaker
pretenders
like
new
belgium
abbey
or
egads
blue
moon
abbey
this
will
hold
a
regular
place
in
my
fridge
b
messy
too
spicy
and
dry
imo
instantly
reminded
me
of
smaller
home
brewed
version
of
victorys
golden
monkey
and
thats
never
a
good
thing
o
a
flavorful
yet
sessionable
bpa
with
a
yeast
profile
very
close
to
that
of
a
good
hefeweizen
man
i
really
want
ng
to
make
a
tripel
overall
this
is
a
smooth
bpa
that
isnt
too
complicated
easy
to
drink
hits
the
yeasty
notes
with
a
small
bit
of
honey
sweetness
and
ginger
bitterness
in
the
background
not
the
best
bpa
out
there
it
mainly
could
use
a
little
bit
more
body
and
carbonation
along
with
some
more
sweetness
its
a
bit
too
onedimensional
with
the
dominant
yeast
here
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
not
my
favorite
from
new
glarus
but
it
still
is
a
decent
beer
glad
to
try
another
of
their
offerings
balanced
lowabv
but
crammed
with
flavor
a
mouthfeel
is
great
clean
and
crisp
with
a
moderat
carbonation
this
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
scents
of
yeast
and
banana
the
texture
is
pretty
full
with
a
decent
about
of
carbonation
delivering
a
smooth
mellow
banana
taste
very
well
made
and
a
great
corelease
with
staghorn
oktoberfest
o
a
very
well
done
belgian
style
pale
ale
is
there
any
style
dan
cant
brew
well
good
stuff
will
be
drinking
this
all
fall
long
a
lot
of
flavor
for
5
3abv
ng
maybe
you
should
brew
a
bad
beer
just
so
i
know
that
you
are
not
cheating
i
kid
of
course
interesting
mix
of
flavors
not
the
best
new
glarus
had
to
offer
but
not
the
worst
either
o
i
dont
remember
care
too
much
for
this
fresh
but
this
a
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
at
the
moment
o
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
wish
that
it
wasnt
the
last
time
i
will
probably
be
drinking
this
overall
someone
described
this
as
a
session
quad
and
id
agree
with
that
they
squeezed
all
those
belgian
abbey
flavour
you
know
and
love
into
this
little
beer
really
tasty
stuff
o
this
is
not
the
best
version
of
this
style
i
have
sampled
however
ng
has
done
very
well
the
essence
of
the
style
shines
through
and
its
extremely
quaffable
its
damn
good
and
you
could
have
several
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
version
of
the
style
that
lacks
a
bit
of
the
complexity
some
of
the
finer
examples
offer
perhaps
a
fresher
bottle
would
have
more
character
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
take
on
the
style
but
noting
about
it
really
draws
me
in
or
keeps
my
interest
a
very
enjoyable
beer
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
before
this
one
was
retired
overall
it
is
an
average
beer
almost
seems
diluted
not
much
character
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
to
start
with
when
first
exploring
the
style
this
is
no
duvel
but
it
is
a
very
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
that
will
leave
one
interested
in
seeking
out
other
belgian
ales
overall
bpas
arent
a
style
i
dink
a
ton
of
but
this
is
not
one
ill
plan
on
having
again
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
is
low
on
the
spectrum
of
how
i
like
the
style
from
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
orange
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
lacking
any
real
spice
you
might
expect
from
a
belgian
but
does
have
a
hint
of
bananas
and
cloves
at
first
followed
quickly
by
a
malty
smoothness
and
finishes
lightly
bitter
and
sour
this
beer
definitely
improved
as
it
warmed
decent
while
cold
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
an
excellent
one
first
chance
to
try
and
get
a
hold
of
the
aroma
yields
a
wonderful
vibrant
blend
of
aromas
fresh
grassy
notes
and
a
nice
tart
lemon
smell
start
coming
up
right
away
very
interesting
and
not
what
i
expected
at
first
but
very
very
pleasant
warming
brings
on
almost
a
grape
skin
like
note
to
it
just
a
touch
of
funk
that
blends
in
very
well
with
the
bright
lemon
that
i
am
still
picking
up
each
sip
now
becomes
more
and
more
and
exploratory
effort
into
what
can
be
done
when
you
shed
the
constraints
of
a
style
and
brew
good
beer
period
smooth
subtle
and
building
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
lovely
balance
of
light
earthy
hops
some
notes
of
citrus
and
light
sour
all
blending
as
one
nothing
dominating
here
at
all
just
working
together
towards
a
common
goal
it
seems
as
if
each
sip
is
something
more
unique
more
perplexing
the
one
before
prickly
carbonation
nips
at
the
tongue
keeping
the
feel
lively
and
fresh
and
allowing
light
flavors
to
penetrate
every
inch
of
the
mouth
d
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
is
complex
yet
understated
however
it
is
just
a
bit
lacluster
in
the
flavor
from
the
amazing
aroma
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
didnt
ebay
to
think
about
my
beer
delicious
and
quenching
overall
i
dont
mind
this
beer
its
another
drinkable
session
beer
from
new
glarus
nothing
amazing
or
eyeopening
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
much
rather
reach
for
than
any
macro
ever
available
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
lighter
but
very
solid
belgian
style
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
pours
a
hazy
light
yelloworange
with
a
2
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
whatsoever
smells
of
belgian
yeast
spices
clove
ginger
banana
and
some
malt
taste
is
of
belgian
yeast
the
aforementioned
spices
banana
flavors
and
some
wheatlike
malts
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
due
to
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
am
still
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
from
new
glarus
mixed
results
here
i
wonder
how
it
will
mutate
further
in
the
cellar
as
time
goes
on
this
is
a
spicy
slightly
sweet
mostly
dry
belgian
pale
a
session
beer
as
belgians
go
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
recent
hefeweizens
i
had
over
the
weekend
for
the
smooth
fruit
candy
character
theres
touches
of
orange
blossom
and
pale
malt
but
the
yeast
dominates
here
id
want
a
little
more
depth
here
but
its
a
fine
beer
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
for
the
most
part
are
complex
and
work
well
together
the
banana
flavors
and
the
spices
compliment
each
other
nicely
felt
like
it
could
have
poured
a
bit
nicer
and
the
aroma
was
a
touch
lacking
im
extremely
surprised
this
carries
a
b
avg
on
here
it
was
one
of
the
most
disappointing
craft
beers
i
have
ever
had
d
not
the
one
i
would
choose
for
the
style
but
it
was
ok
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
yellow
with
a
good
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smell
banana
and
spice
taste
more
banana
and
spice
against
a
sweet
malt
backbone
producing
a
flavor
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
wrigleys
juicy
fruit
gum
but
in
a
good
way
medium
mouthfeel
crisp
finish
a
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
beer
in
a
style
i
admittedly
know
nothing
about
goes
great
with
pork
chops
drinkability
forst
beer
from
new
glarus
and
this
was
not
that
great
an
avg
belgian
pale
its
a
intro
to
craft
beer
color
is
hazy
yellow
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thick
foamy
head
aroma
of
banana
and
yeast
taste
is
creamy
and
fruity
starting
with
a
light
to
medium
body
that
goes
down
smooth
with
a
very
creamy
feel
finish
is
a
fruity
yeast
flavor
with
a
nice
banana
taste
and
a
faint
bitterness
smooth
but
light
in
taste
for
the
style
something
to
look
forward
to
a
comeback
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
solid
beer
i
wouldnt
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
nice
light
flavors
lead
to
easy
drinkability
this
is
a
tasty
bpa
at
a
decent
price
worth
checking
out
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
disapated
there
isnt
much
of
a
smell
at
all
the
taste
is
full
of
spices
and
a
strong
organe
flavor
very
simialir
to
a
belgian
witbeir
nice
carnonation
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
but
much
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
its
still
enjoyabe
i
was
expecting
a
differnt
taste
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
give
it
a
shot
if
you
have
the
opportunity
d
becuase
of
its
clean
finish
the
estery
character
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
doesnt
overpower
the
palate
this
is
a
perfect
summeronthedeck
lazy
afternoon
beer
i
may
have
to
reassess
my
rating
after
i
study
the
style
and
finish
the
six
pack
other
than
color
ng
may
have
nailed
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
frothy
foam
the
smell
is
strongly
of
belgian
yeast
components
a
good
majority
of
which
is
clove
orange
zest
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
the
cinnamon
comes
through
on
the
taste
buds
as
well
there
is
almost
a
hefeweizen
like
taste
to
this
beer
and
im
surprised
to
find
out
that
it
was
not
there
is
a
lot
of
clove
on
the
tongue
and
the
wheat
provides
a
bit
of
a
smoother
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
for
the
spring
and
summer
weather
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
cold
out
right
now
i
would
have
to
go
out
and
enjoy
this
beer
outdoors
a
very
good
beer
overall
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
hazy
dark
golden
straw
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
bit
of
a
citrus
smell
a
nice
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
good
flavor
including
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
nice
smooth
drinking
beer
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
as
i
wasnt
even
sure
of
the
style
going
in
but
i
really
liked
it
and
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
pours
a
nice
hazy
goldenbread
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
good
dose
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
forward
some
nice
citrus
with
orange
and
lemons
at
the
forefront
along
with
a
bit
of
grassy
spice
really
nice
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
fallback
from
the
nose
and
the
malt
is
accentuated
a
bit
more
for
a
bit
of
a
bready
domination
good
yeasty
notes
in
the
background
though
light
crisp
feel
really
nice
and
drinkable
and
something
i
miss
being
able
to
grab
packs
of
reviewed
on
242010
bottle
thanks
to
skyview
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
clove
melon
rind
flavor
of
light
fruits
sweet
honey
melon
belgian
yeast
and
tons
of
spices
smooth
drinking
nice
belgian
ale
very
similar
to
crackd
wheat
actually
with
the
sweet
fruity
notes
combined
with
the
clove
and
belgian
spices
pleasant
and
tasty
d
not
bad
but
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
often
lighter
medium
body
pretty
lively
on
the
tongue
slightly
dry
drinks
smooth
with
refreshing
flavor
a
pretty
solid
belgian
pale
ale
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
definitely
one
of
new
glarus
better
standard
offerings
nothing
really
stands
out
but
its
well
crafted
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
good
belgian
pale
for
one
made
in
the
us
a
nice
juicy
pale
maltiness
with
a
salivating
amount
of
spiciness
and
esters
full
on
cloves
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
sour
apple
and
banana
taffy
present
a
lovely
duet
in
the
midsip
with
a
semi
sweet
finish
which
is
medium
bodied
pinpoint
carbonation
give
this
beer
a
creamy
texture
and
a
nice
spritziness
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
need
more
though
drinkability
smooth
delicate
fancy
pour
that
champagne
in
to
the
dog
dish
and
give
this
a
shot
instead
toe
to
toe
could
kick
the
hell
outta
any
french
champagne
at
twice
the
price
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
a
little
flat
drinkable
but
not
exceptional
beer
d
having
recently
had
rr
redemption
this
one
just
doesnt
compare
not
bad
though
solid
in
every
aspect
of
the
word
flavor
just
comes
across
as
a
little
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
with
spices
that
dont
quite
work
together
still
id
reach
for
this
one
again
another
entry
in
the
preinterview
extravaganza
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
clove
pepper
wheat
lemon
zest
and
coriander
the
taste
launches
on
a
heavy
banana
and
clove
jag
coming
down
later
with
some
pepper
and
cardamom
it
may
be
pretty
simplistic
but
it
is
definitely
effective
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
prickly
fluid
feel
overall
a
very
nice
bpa
easily
drinkable
and
readily
enjoyable
i
first
had
this
beer
a
year
before
i
really
got
into
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
followed
up
on
it
then
this
is
comfort
food
in
a
bottle
a
pretty
good
little
beer
here
this
would
have
been
better
with
a
meal
as
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
these
all
night
drinkability
doesnt
seem
like
something
i
would
pick
up
too
often
but
has
a
few
qualities
that
are
appealing
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
white
head
good
lacing
smell
some
banana
yeast
tastes
are
some
yeast
light
banana
a
hint
of
apple
at
the
finish
good
amount
of
carb
the
drinkability
is
out
of
this
world
what
a
great
beer
especially
for
a
regular
in
their
lineup
new
glarus
impresses
me
every
time
d
modestly
high
stone
soup
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lingers
in
a
fine
layer
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
tons
of
esters
and
phenolic
character
the
beer
is
light
dry
malt
with
more
tart
yeasty
character
and
a
dry
phenolic
finish
there
are
tons
of
flavors
going
on
in
this
beer
almost
too
much
for
its
strength
but
interesting
overall
thanks
thomashardy
for
the
opportunity
d
high
an
interesting
hybrid
of
ingredients
to
create
a
classic
style
its
not
too
busy
it
will
turn
off
those
who
abhor
banana
beers
but
overall
it
adheres
to
style
and
is
thoughtprovoking
without
being
overly
clever
another
solid
quality
beer
from
new
glarus
drinks
well
but
i
have
to
give
a
lower
score
here
because
its
just
not
real
close
to
the
style
i
seriously
wonder
if
i
got
a
bottle
of
one
of
their
hefes
that
got
mislabled
still
a
drinkable
and
flavorful
beer
thanks
to
ugabeerguy
for
sharing
this
bottle
pours
a
very
pale
golden
with
a
small
head
smells
typically
of
belgian
yeast
with
some
coriander
and
some
late
sweetness
interesting
flavors
banana
wheat
coriander
and
light
spiciness
not
too
sweet
as
many
american
versions
of
this
beer
are
crisp
and
spicy
in
the
mouth
i
enjoyed
this
not
mindaltering
but
a
bit
different
and
quite
enjoyable
true
to
style
but
not
somthing
i
could
drink
more
of
its
seems
out
of
place
alone
with
no
food
not
my
kind
of
beer
d
very
drinkable
yet
not
as
complex
or
fulfilling
as
what
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
smell
a
second
review
without
the
yeast
being
poured
into
the
glass
seems
to
be
in
order
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
really
resonate
with
me
the
bubblegum
and
banana
flavors
are
not
my
favorite
a
decent
take
on
a
bpa
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
d
this
is
the
type
of
belgium
pale
ale
that
i
could
sessionand
have
great
flavors
and
a
very
light
bodied
easy
drinking
ale
d
i
had
this
with
a
grilled
cheese
and
it
was
pretty
damn
tasty
i
could
see
having
more
then
one
or
two
without
a
problem
cheers
another
incredibly
drinkable
beer
by
new
glarus
and
a
testament
to
their
ability
to
brew
any
style
with
complexity
and
finesse
d
nice
and
easy
drinking
though
lacking
a
bit
on
the
flavor
i
wanted
the
flavors
to
be
just
a
little
bigger
to
match
what
i
smelled
not
a
let
down
but
not
the
beer
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
and
sharp
once
again
champagnelike
the
carbonation
tingle
remained
long
after
the
beer
was
gone
if
you
like
an
assault
of
carbonation
and
a
gang
bang
of
spicy
flavor
give
it
a
try
a
excessive
head
on
an
easy
pour
quickly

to
a
centimeter
of
bumpy
foam

no

a

thing
going
on
some
faint

i
mean
faint
spice
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
effervescent
but
that
was
the
only
thing
average
about
the
beer
as
far
as
belgian
pale
ales
go
this
sits
at
the
bottom
in
my
book
another
nice
offering
from
new
glarus
d
interesting
not
ngs
best
work
but
dan
cant
hit
it
out
of
the
park
every
time
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
say
worth
a
6
pack
given
ngs
alternative
options
d
drinks
very
easily
d
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
the
pepper
tastes
that
come
with
this
beer
change
the
drinkability
but
opens
up
some
opportunities
for
food
pairings
d
this
is
a
decentabove
average
brewbut
rd
is
worlds
better
than
this
the
nose
is
goodbut
the
pale
malt
comes
through
a
littl
to
much
in
the
flavor
for
me
which
makes
this
a
little
bit
more
run
of
the
mill
than
most
brews
i
have
had
of
the
style
drinkability
easily
my
favorite
new
glarus
thus
far
great
balance
and
belgian
pale
ale
flavors
coupled
with
the
exceptional
drinkability
of
new
glarus
beers
amazing
poured
into
a
water
glass
had
a
rich
caramel
color
with
light
carbonation
and
a
small
fluffy
white
head
aroma
was
predominately
malt
with
caramel
and
honey
overtones
taste
was
slightly
chewy
lightly
sweet
with
cane
sugar
and
bananna
followed
by
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
citrus
d
very
nice
and
refreshing
and
evidently
wellcrafted
while
the
stone
soup
may
appear
unimpressive
i
can
assure
you
it
is
anything
but
the
more
distinguished
palates
can
pick
up
traces
of
vanilla
and
subtle
hints
of
citrus
amongst
its
sweet
ginger
overtones
it
drinks
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
thats
what
she
said
nice
solid
everyday
drinking
beer
notes
eh
the
after
taste
makes
it
not
for
me
for
others
though
i
think
it
has
good
drinkability
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
toasted
grains
and
some
yeasty
twang
up
front
smooth
soft
wheat
malts
follow
accented
by
notes
of
tropical
fruit
and
melon
mildly
peppery
spicy
hops
follow
as
the
malt
gets
breadier
cantaloupe
and
fruity
dough
in
the
finish
with
lingering
peppery
hop
bitterness
mediumbodied
with
a
proteinrich
feel
not
bad
very
wheaty
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
though
f
some
bitterness
with
orange
peel
grassy
and
citrus
hops
spicy
and
floral
hop
flavors
lingering
pale
hop
flavors
most
mild
on
the
initial
taste
but
seem
to
get
a
little
astringent
on
the
finish
but
ever
so
slightly
more
lingering
belgian
sweet
malts
but
dries
a
bit
as
well
a
nice
tasty
belgian
pale
i
have
to
say
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
the
belgian
malt
flavor
and
a
little
more
hoppy
flavor
but
thats
my
opinion
and
it
is
a
nice
tasty
beer
exceptional
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
a
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
for
the
coming
summer
months
cheers
d
quality
beer
almost
saisonlike
second
beer
from
ng
and
another
that
i
enjoyed
greatly
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
was
an
interesting
beer
with
a
mix
of
some
good
flavors
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
was
outstanding
in
any
of
the
flavors
though
d
a
great
summer
beer
everything
about
this
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
dgreat
drinkability
even
though
not
favorite
style
nor
my
favorite
new
glarus
beer
overall
something
like
a
cross
between
a
belgian
blond
and
a
german
hefeweizen
quite
tasty
and
would
be
great
with
food
this
is
a
fun
brew
and
the
fact
that
they
use
wisconsin
malt
really
puts
it
over
the
top
for
me
i
could
see
this
being
delightful
in
cold
or
hot
weather
and
will
definitely
be
stocking
up
on
it
next
time
i
am
in
wisconsin
smooth
up
front
a
bit
metallic
to
note
well
carbonated
and
the
body
is
firm
and
medium
has
a
full
robust
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
no
bitterness
as
the
use
of
hops
here
are
minimal
good
sweetness
as
well
the
flavor
lingers
and
subdues
your
taste
buds
its
a
very
easy
drinker
not
overly
complex
a
very
sessionable
beer
glad
i
found
some
more
smooth
taste
nothing
really
too
bold
or
cutting
edge
makes
it
a
safe
beer
for
people
to
try
or
get
into
this
style
or
craft
beer
with
got
some
nice
lemon
esters
that
play
a
nice
role
in
the
nose
and
taste
not
really
bitter
which
i
personally
like
but
there
is
a
sharp
bite
to
the
hops
good
relaxing
beer
but
almost
to
full
of
a
body
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
the
taste
is
intriguing
and
unexpected
mainly
it
its
bonedryness
the
brew
has
belgian
tripel
flavors
but
the
crispness
and
tartness
is
almost
austere
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sharp
the
sourness
in
the
finish
is
what
takes
this
beers
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
down
a
peg
not
fulfilling
the
promise
of
the
nose
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
new
glarus
offerings
could
use
some
tweaking
d
this
is
a
ok
beer
ive
tried
to
like
belgian
pale
ale
but
can
get
into
them
still
a
big
fan
of
new
glarus
d
could
be
a
good
summer
beer
there
is
something
missing
with
this
bpa
its
good
but
i
cant
figure
out
what
its
missing
maybe
too
much
clove
and
spice
and
not
enough
sweet
malt
d
thought
this
was
a
decent
pale
ale
nice
yeast
and
banana
taste
and
very
easy
to
drink
id
try
it
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
new
glarus
it
has
a
crisp
taste
with
a
light
fruit
note
at
the
end
it
is
good
for
a
cold
winter
drinking
beer
or
a
hot
summer
night
i
have
drank
this
beer
served
from
room
temp
to
ice
cold
and
i
have
not
found
a
bad
time
to
have
it
this
brewing
company
only
sells
in
wisconsin
but
it
is
well
worth
the
drive
to
get
it
i
wasnt
extremely
impressed
with
stone
soup
it
was
similar
to
other
new
glarus
beers
ive
had
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
as
good
as
others
it
pours
a
nice
shade
of
gold
i
thought
the
taste
was
alright
somewhat
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
i
would
recommend
this
beer
but
i
think
new
glarus
has
some
better
brews
to
offer
mouthfeel
is
good
with
some
lively
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
body
easy
to
drink
beer
pleasant
but
not
a
lot
a
character
pours
a
pale
yellow
and
very
cloudy
head
dissipates
very
quickly
it
looks
like
champagne
in
the
glass
lots
of
big
bubbles
that
explode
at
the
surface
it
smells
like
a
clovey
hefeweizen
lemons
begin
the
taste
and
then
it
finishes
spicey
the
is
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
going
on
bouncing
all
over
my
tongue
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
new
glarus
beers
i
got
to
try
thanks
to
nick
the
intern
and
his
fatherinlaw
d
id
believe
this
was
an
actual
belgiummade
belgian
pale
ale
which
is
saying
something
obviously
a
lot
of
care
and
craft
went
into
the
production
of
the
beer
although
i
dont
think
its
really
an
amazing
standout
example
of
the
style
still
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
if
i
were
in
the
place
to
do
so
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
hue
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
slowly
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
some
minor
stick
here
and
there
on
the
glass
overall
a
typical
looking
belgian
aroma
consists
of
clove
spice
yeast
and
banana
again
typical
belgian
taste
begins
with
the
faint
banana
bread
and
some
citrus
midway
a
metallic
ting
emerges
with
pear
and
white
grapes
aftertaste
is
bready
and
grainy
with
a
sugary
sweetness
that
lingers
pillowy
soft
feel
with
steady
carbonation
and
a
light
to
medium
body
just
another
easy
drinking
full
flavored
ale
from
new
glarus
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
down
on
a
warm
summer
day
a
slow
pour
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
offers
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
theres
a
little
bit
of
lacing
its
a
nice
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
this
has
a
strong
wheat
smell
a
typical
belgian
that
does
nothing
in
that
aspect
to
stick
out
from
the
crowd
the
taste
is
about
the
same
theres
a
bit
of
bitterness
with
the
grain
taste
but
it
leads
into
a
nice
light
aftertaste
this
whole
beer
is
light
on
the
tongue
which
increases
the
drinkability
fans
of
the
style
will
probably
drink
a
lot
of
these
the
flavors
mix
together
well
and
make
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
a
great
one
to
open
on
a
hot
summer
day
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
my
brothers
house
in
wi
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
hazy
light
gold
nice
offwhite
head
on
top
retained
well
left
some
nice
lace
on
the
side
very
crisp
body
which
is
par
for
the
style
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
that
feel
a
little
harsh
big
yeast
scent
mixed
with
some
pineapple
flavors
of
sour
yeast
citrus
and
a
mild
bready
flavor
on
the
finish
this
was
not
as
sharp
as
i
expected
it
was
drinkable
and
tasty
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
large
fruity
component
very
nice
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
fruit
and
malty
sweetness
with
bananas
and
cloves
being
apparent
there
is
also
a
belgian
yeast
character
nothing
necessarily
stands
out
in
this
beer
but
everything
meshes
together
nicely
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
when
the
weather
warms
up
notes
im
pretty
unfamiliar
with
belgian
pale
ales
but
this
seems
remarkably
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
to
me
not
quite
as
bready
not
quite
as
creamy
and
a
tad
more
fruity
but
still
has
the
major
qualities
of
a
good
hefe
this
is
certainly
not
a
complaint
and
mostly
just
shows
my
ignorance
of
belgian
singles
regardless
of
all
this
its
another
winner
from
new
glarus
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
has
a
massive
three
finger
white
head
and
beneath
it
lies
a
light
goldenstraw
color
brew
with
a
slight
hazing
and
very
active
carbonation
phenols
are
very
apparent
sweet
clove
and
banana
taste
has
similar
qualities
but
they
seem
to
develop
more
there
are
the
initial
phenols
but
they
seem
more
reserved
but
the
banana
stays
strong
and
at
the
end
there
is
a
sweet
slightly
acidic
light
fruit
note
that
is
a
mixture
of
pear
white
grape
and
peaches
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
body
with
a
velvety
but
active
carbonation
and
has
a
dry
finish
overall
a
drinkable
beer
another
good
one
by
ng
fairly
drinkable
and
rather
pleasant
another
nice
brew
from
new
glarus
drinkability
this
beer
has
some
nice
spiciness
to
it
easy
to
quaff
this
one
but
it
wont
blow
you
away
made
the
trip
to
new
glarus
last
weekend
so
i
have
a
boat
load
new
glarus
beer
to
review
the
first
is
stone
soup
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
small
head
that
faded
very
fast
also
showed
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
of
spice
and
yeast
taste
was
of
light
citrus
flavors
spice
and
hints
of
yeast
also
hints
of
sour
dough
bread
mouthfeel
was
good
as
was
the
drinkability
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
nice
showed
some
fairly
complex
flavor
notes
wish
i
had
bought
more
and
wish
i
didnt
have
to
go
to
wisconsin
to
get
it
drinkability
is
very
good
as
the
beer
goes
down
incredibly
easily
with
no
harsh
flavors
or
astringency
served
from
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
opaque
medium
coppergolden
with
a
moderate
head
that
subsides
leaving
very
little
by
way
of
foam
and
lightmoderate
lacing
excellent
aroma
with
yeasty
bubblegum
characteristics
yeast
and
bubblegum
notes
also
come
to
the
fore
in
the
taste
which
also
shows
off
malty
banana
aspects
nice
tight
carbonation
lends
a
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
representative
of
the
style
another
winner
from
new
glarus
part
of
a
ng
sampler
twelver
my
friend
josh
brought
back
from
wisconsin
drinkability
this
one
started
out
weak
got
a
little
stronger
but
then
ended
weak
as
i
got
more
in
to
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
a
new
glarus
of
course
and
all
things
ng
are
pretty
fantastic
but
some
are
less
fantastic
than
others
and
this
isnt
in
the
pantheon
of
great
ng
at
5
3
its
surely
drinkable
but
there
are
others
id
rather
drink
at
this
level
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
not
sure
about
how
it
fits
the
style
as
it
has
some
characteristics
of
a
hefeweizen
but
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
all
night
a
fantastic
beer
that
finishes
well
and
doesnt
get
you
hammered
with
a
high
abv
there
is
a
reason
i
love
new
glarus
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
yet
take
a
look
at
all
their
beer
reviews
and
you
wont
see
one
below
a
b
highly
recommended
d
very
good
could
pleasantly
drink
these
all
day
the
taste
is
very
neutral
and
simple
but
enjoyable
and
allows
you
drink
a
lot
right
off
the
bat
you
taste
a
little
yeast
the
middle
is
light
but
then
you
have
some
sweet
hops
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
nicely
done
beer
a
good
pale
that
smells
tastes
and
feels
great
an
easy
one
to
put
back
i
could
knock
a
few
of
these
around
pretty
easily
would
i
buy
more
of
it
maybe
not
totally
sold
on
it
plus
id
have
to
go
to
wisconsin
to
get
more
and
i
think
id
rather
buy
some
of
new
glarus
other
beers
instead
though
new
glarus
takes
a
valiant
and
very
drinkable
attempt
at
this
style
for
me
at
least
it
is
becoming
increasingly
evident
that
the
american
brewers
havent
harnessed
the
secret
of
belgain
ales
as
of
yet
there
just
didnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
it
seemed
almost
bland
and
watery
it
definitely
went
down
fast
but
there
are
better
new
glarus
offerings
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
depth
from
a
belgian
pale
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
bunch
of
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
nice
head
that
receded
slowly
and
left
some
lacing
smell
is
highly
concentrated
mashed
bananas
with
some
light
spices
rounding
it
out
taste
is
fairly
light
malts
with
small
background
hints
of
clove
not
really
much
in
the
way
of
spices
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
subdued
carbonation
on
the
tongue
not
bad
but
not
anything
noteworthy
overall
im
not
sure
whether
to
think
of
this
as
an
american
german
or
belgian
beer
but
any
way
you
classify
it
its
only
fair
in
appearance
the
head
is
white
and
on
the
small
and
fizzy
side
though
the
body
is
a
pleasant
dandelion
sunny
yellow
with
a
slight
haze
nose
is
like
a
lovely
mix
of
hefeweizen
and
tripel
full
of
banana
and
clove
as
well
as
bright
citrus
orange
sherbet
and
wild
herbs
oregano
and
juniper
tangy
spicy
and
bittersweet
bubblegummy
and
full
of
banana
clove
rye
bread
and
orange
delicate
notes
of
champagne
and
lemon
drops
contribute
to
an
overall
fruity
yet
dry
and
spicy
flavor
perfectly
textured
with
round
rolling
carbonation
and
a
dry
citric
finish
i
have
no
idea
how
strong
this
beer
is
but
it
is
very
drinkable
it
brings
that
distinctive
new
glarus
hefeweizenlike
yeast
to
a
belgian
style
with
delicious
results
d
a
great
drinkable
belgiany
beer
i
know
this
isnt
everyones
favorite
offering
from
new
glarus
but
i
love
it
and
it
is
my
favorite
one
in
their
lineup
im
steadily
working
my
way
through
the
ng
lineup
so
heres
another
one
in
the
books
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
the
head
is
enormus
and
bright
white
after
it
settles
no
lace
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
clove
and
banana
are
right
up
front
yeast
and
breadiness
notes
are
present
as
well
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
dry
banana
and
spice
are
first
on
the
list
followed
by
lemon
and
a
cracker
like
tone
the
dry
fininsh
is
rather
mouth
puckering
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
i
might
pass
on
this
one
later
on
very
tasty
take
on
a
belgian
single
pale
very
good
drinkability
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
the
carbonation
really
tickles
the
taste
buds
juicy
in
the
mouth
and
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
drinkable
beer
pours
a
huge
foamy
white
3
finger
head
the
lace
dissipates
fairly
quickly
has
a
cloudy
gold
color
smells
of
yeast
malt
fruit
and
cloves
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
compared
to
other
belgian
pale
ales
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
banana
is
the
strongest
fruit
flavor
this
beer
is
slightly
sweet
dry
with
high
carbonation
and
somewhat
thin
good
drinkability
overall
a
decent
beer
d
its
a
great
summer
beer
but
for
me
personally
it
is
a
bit
too
light
d
damn
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
belgian
style
that
surprised
me
in
everyway
good
fruits
and
layering
in
complexity
pours
a
lightly
hazed
yellowish
gold
thin
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
ring
no
lacing
on
the
glass
looks
okay
smell
is
okay
apricot
some
floral
biscuits
honey
and
caramel
peaches
creamed
corn
banana
touch
of
spice
kind
of
interesting
taste
is
similar
alcohol
comes
through
light
banana
spice
very
fruity
apricots
and
peach
wheat
peppery
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
quite
dry
in
the
finish
alright
but
doesnt
do
much
for
me
pours
a
fairly
clear
gold
nose
is
yeasty
fruity
goodness
flavor
is
very
nice
nice
balance
yeast
tones
fruit
edges
noticed
spices
slightly
thicker
liquid
body
even
a
mediocre
belgian
ale
used
to
be
an
accomplishment
for
an
american
brewer
nowadays
i
think
that
the
bar
has
been
raised
and
people
are
able
to
do
some
very
nice
interpretations
very
easy
to
drink
very
weird
a
good
beer
just
not
sure
this
adds
up
to
anything
that
meets
the
advertised
style
i
could
have
easily
confused
this
for
a
hefe
or
perhaps
even
a
tripel
on
an
off
day
3
54
its
drinkable
and
generally
inoffensive
though
lacking
in
character
stone
soup
is
not
one
of
new
glaruss
most
outstanding
offerings
it
needs
more
flavor
more
depth
and
more
complexity
all
of
which
would
be
provided
by
more
barley
and
more
belgian
yeastiness
dan
carey
is
a
damn
good
brewer
but
theres
some
room
for
improvement
here
drank
really
easy
for
the
style
an
approachable
yet
fairly
complex
take
on
the
style
that
is
session
worthy
when
many
others
are
just
too
damn
potent
yet
another
winner
from
new
glarus
i
went
into
this
one
with
high
hopes
but
unfortunately
really
cant
say
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
is
great
as
well
easy
drinking
and
very
smooth
d
a
really
good
belgian
ale
great
hop
flavor
not
too
sweet
nice
hop
bitterness
i
will
definatly
have
this
ale
again
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
might
actually
have
two
per
session
if
i
had
more
than
just
one
major
congratulations
out
to
new
glarus
on
this
one
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
line
so
far
so
far
that
is
i
still
have
three
to
sample
this
beer
poured
with
a
1
inch
head
and
some
cloudiness
also
some
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
at
first
the
nose
was
lots
of
tart
apple
andor
pears
after
the
drink
sat
for
a
bit
the
nose
became
mostly
bananas
and
vanilla
taste
is
good
with
apples
and
tart
citrus
the
big
discount
to
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
i
feel
this
beer
should
have
some
zing
and
carbonated
bite
then
i
would
give
it
much
higher
marks
still
enjoyable
and
fresh
d
interesting
brew
again
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
hefeweizen
than
a
bpa
but
it
is
refreshing
nonetheless
pretty
decent
beer
but
i
liked
the
fat
squirrel
better
hv
d
absolutley
very
smooth
and
i
am
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
ales
this
is
a
very
average
belgian
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
d
relatively
light
a
good
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
but
this
beer
lacks
a
good
reason
to
drink
it
as
there
are
far
better
on
the
market
there
is
nothing
characteristic
in
flavor
or
aroma
maybe
it
would
pair
better
with
a
light
meal
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
one
of
ngs
finest
but
still
decent
too
much
carbonation
for
me
i
could
drink
more
but
i
would
choose
to
switch
it
up
instead
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
have
been
excite
to
drink
some
new
glarus
as
its
available
nowhere
outside
of
wisconsin
i
picked
up
a
few
other
styles
while
i
was
up
there
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
them
mostly
its
a
good
beer
drinkable
but
nothing
over
the
top
or
super
exciting
here
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
like
that
of
a
pils
color
although
unlike
a
pils
this
one
is
hazy
with
a
nice
fluffy
cloud
like
head
that
does
dissipate
to
a
very
nice
looking
fresh
ring
til
the
end
the
smell
is
typical
belgium
it
has
the
clove
the
spice
the
yeast
and
the
fruit
you
know
this
ale
will
be
good
yup
its
great
it
hits
you
with
some
nice
yeast
and
clove
with
some
apples
and
melons
and
cinnamon
tastes
nothing
overpowering
just
very
tasty
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
velvety
creamy
and
delicious
if
you
like
belgiums
youll
love
this
one
cause
its
so
easy
drinking
ng
always
puts
out
great
brew
styles
in
their
categories
they
never
disappoint
recommended
for
sure
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
the
head
is
a
solid
half
inch
of
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
bubblegum
hints
of
anise
and
light
notes
of
other
spices
the
taste
is
of
belgian
malt
bubblegum
anise
and
spices
there
is
a
lot
of
complexity
here
in
both
the
taste
and
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brabant
stlye
ale
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
i
like
this
beer
but
do
not
love
it
meh
you
can
only
be
so
happy
pours
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
strong
yeast
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
cleanliness
hops
banana
clove
and
sweet
malt
overall
a
good
blend
smooth
and
slightly
watery
in
body
pretty
good
stuff
but
i
would
take
most
all
of
their
other
beers
over
it
the
taste
just
seems
kind
of
funky
to
me
not
a
bad
offering
though
german
hops
belgian
yeast
and
english
malt
combine
to
form
a

might

it
a

for

it
isnt

turn
to

that
its

its
not

on

with
some
of

finest
belgian

but
unfortunately
the
most
important
element
taste
is
lacking
one
of
the
rare
disappointments
to
come
from

from

sour

just
doesnt

the

this
one
would
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
theres
nothing
special
about
this
beer
just
another
farmhouse
style
on
the
market
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
new
glarus
beers
a
solid
brew
from
new
glarus
ive
had
some
better
in
the
past
but
this
is
an
affordable
highly
drinkable
brew
i
think
ill
crack
another
not
a
bad
offering
from
new
glarus
i
think
the
beer
is
a
little
confused
about
itself
and
it
never
settles
into
something
overly
drinkable
worth
a
try
tasty
offering
to
say
the
least
well
done
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
haylike
hue
head
was
bright
white
and
stayed
the
aroma
was
hefebel
i
smell
hefe
yeast
with
a
bit
of
belgian
scent
no
hop
smell
i
taste
spices
and
yeast
again
no
hops
mmouthfeel
is
great
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
quite
sessionable
dunbelieveably
easy
to
drink
i
could
definately
put
a
sixer
of
this
down
at
a
brewer
tailgate
d
heres
a
tip
let
the
carbonation
let
out
on
this
one
for
a
while
and
you
can
really
taste
the
nuances
of
this
beer
once
you
are
able
to
taste
it
its
really
good
carbonation
is
a
bit
of
an
annoyance
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
great
in
warm
weather
i
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
when
having
a
caesar
salad
or
a
nice
spicy
dish
i
would
drink
more
of
these
if
they
were
available
the
sessionability
of
it
makes
the
aftertaste
acceptable
as
i
dont
dwell
on
it
like
i
would
with
a
bigger
sipper
a
tough
one
to
put
numbers
to
but
overall
something
just
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
i
needed
something
more
what
that
is
im
unsure
this
is
drinkable
enough
however
a
decent
standard
of
ale
for
a
quick
enjoyment
but
quite
possibly
a
bit
boring
beyond
one
or
two
different
but
only
ok
drinkability
well
the
weather
has
finally
turned
warm
around
here
so
a
spicy
fruity
easy
drinking
beer
is
great
for
coming
off
of
some
yard
work
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
another
solid
offering
from
new
glarus
dim
impressed
a
nice
stab
at
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
the
greatest
one
ever
made
but
i
would
have
no
problem
having
this
one
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
thanks
to
kmpitz
for
the
birthday
present
that
keeps
on
giving
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
notes
of
lemon
meringue
the
mouthfee
is
soft
like
whipped
butter
this
is
a
very
delicate
beer
the
malt
has
a
pilsner
quality
and
blends
in
a
very
subtle
way
with
a
very
light
spiciness
i
detect
a
minerallike
quality
to
this
beer
but
maybe
its
the
just
the
name
suggesting
this
to
me
the
dryness
and
slight
tart
character
is
very
pleasant
and
makes
this
beer
very
sessionable
im
thinking
of
it
as
duvel
lite
new
glarus
should
be
commended
for
continually
experimenting
and
brewing
new
styles
d
not
a
bad
beer
just
too
much
candy
banana
flavor
for
my
taste
new
glarus
has
delivered
a
really
interesting
beer
in
their
stone
soup
i
was
initially
unsure
of
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
holding
it
to
the
light
i
found
a
cloudy
golden
orange
body
that
looked
like
a
belgian
witbier
of
course
most
of
new
glarus
beers
have
a
haze
from
bottle
conditioning
but
this
was
fuller
the
frothy
bright
white
head
settled
slowly
into
a
creamy
dollop
on
top
and
it
left
short
walls
of
solid
lace
behind
as
i
drank
the
nose
was
perhaps
the
most
interesting
part
right
out
of
the
gate
giving
off
notes
of
creamy
vanilla
soft
bubblegum
mild
clove
and
a
bit
of
some
sharper
spice
perhaps
ginger
or
allspice
in
the
mouth
it
was
light
and
crisp
mediumlight
bodied
and
gently
zesty
with
a
veryfine
bubbled
natural
carbonation
the
flavor
was
unusual
it
was
somewhat
sharp
a
bit
fruity
candyish
and
spicy
it
came
on
strong
then
softened
revealed
some
malt
and
candyish
vanilla
and
clove
and
finally
faded
away
in
a
longlingering
caress
of
residual
spice
and
malt
residue
kind
of
like
a
belgian
tripel
but
without
the
strength
its
complex
but
not
full
or
rich
you
could
certainly
drink
a
lot
of
these
based
on
the
body
and
flavor
aspects
but
im
not
sure
youd
want
to
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
soft
and
delicate
nature
of
a
witbier
and
yet
its
not
big
enough
to
demand
your
attention
still
i
found
it
quite
charming
and
as
i
tend
to
drink
several
beers
in
an
evening
the
idea
of
a
light
tripel
is
quite
enticing
beyond
that
i
think
id
really
enjoy
this
while
camping
hiking
or
boatingcanoeing
nicely
done
very
well
balanced
refreshing
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
fine
although
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
all
that
spice
yeast
and
sweetness
is
too
distracting
for
me
then
again
some
of
the
big
beers
i
like
are
distracting
for
others
this
just
moves
in
the
wrong
direction
for
me
for
normal
enjoyment
love
the
name
though
took
a
bottle
from
the
fridge
and
poured
it
directly
into
a
clean
glass
pale
to
medium
yellow
a
little
cloudy
which
is
no
surprise
since
its
bottle
conditioned
with
a
nice
big
white
pillowy
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
maybe
its
my
cold
preventing
me
from
smelling
much
lively
carbonation
taste
was
ok
not
bad
not
great
almost
a
little
hint
of
dryness
hops
and
malt
seemed
well
balanced
and
i
could
certainly
taste
the
cloves
and
ginger
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
the
other
5
very
soon
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
yeasty
tart
flavors
and
a
good
soft
grain
and
malt
quality
but
the
flavors
are
really
covered
up
by
the
fizz
i
dont
taste
the
depth
as
described
on
the
label
and
i
was
envisioning
a
totally
different
beer
perhaps
in
a
warm
summer
month
i
will
try
the
rest
of
the
6pack
and
have
a
different
opinion
if
so
i
will
re
review
but
as
of
now
im
a
bit
under
whelmed
overall
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
hefeweizen
but
with
the
banana
and
fruity
notes
toned
back
a
bit
and
the
spicy
clove
and
ginger
more
in
the
forefront
the
carbonation
was
qutie
sparkling
but
i
thought
that
it
went
well
with
the
spicy
and
tangy
nature
of
the
brew
and
kept
it
from
being
overly
syrupy
and
malty
an
interesting
and
original
and
quite
sessionable
brew
yum
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
american
version
of
the
style
however
i
think
that
its
slightly
less
bold
in
flavor
than
most
in
this
class
pump
in
a
little
bit
more
malt
to
this
bugger
and
this
would
be
stupendous
12
oz
bottle
the
beer
is
very
hazy
and
straw
colored
in
appearance
there
is
a
2
finger
foam
over
top
that
falls
rapidly
to
a
halffinger
this
is
maintained
by
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
taking
a
sniff
i
find
a
very
strong
clove
ester
along
with
a
more
subtle
fruity
ester
layered
over
a
candiedsugar
sweet
base
with
just
a
hint
of
an
edge
from
a
grainey
malt
the
first
sip
brings
a
dominant
fruit
and
clove
ester
followed
by
a
mild
sugar
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
lemon
finishing
with
a
moderate
kiss
of
noble
hop
bitterness
and
a
second
wave
of
clove
it
is
very
complex
and
flavorful
without
being
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
end
of
moderate
with
a
very
solid
carbonation
but
without
being
biting
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
very
favorable
i
think
the
balance
in
flavor
really
makes
this
one
a
winner
i
could
easily
see
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
as
well
it
is
slightly
thick
without
being
chewy
and
the
carbonation
really
breaks
it
up
and
keeps
it
from
sitting
heavy
as
well
hazy
lemon
yellow
frothy
snow
white
head
it
fizzes
away
rather
quickly
lace
is
decent
enough
nice
aroma
bubblegum
esters
and
clove
and
a
little
pepper
almost
like
a
hefe
but
theres
a
little
belgian
yeast
contribution
on
the
nose
as
well
sweet
candy
like
malts
combine
with
slight
bubblegum
and
belgian
yeast
esters
and
spice
to
provide
a
nice
little
abbey
style
ale
here
snappy

not

similar

dont
pick

alcohol
nice

clean
nothing
untowards
all
the
way
through
finish
sweet
with
some
citric
counterpoint
additional
note
i
found
this
one
to
taste
much
better
after
swirling
the
glass
to
release
excess
carbonation
i
would
probably
bump
taste
and
mouthfeel
up
a
bit
after
doing
this
but
im
reviewing
it
how
it
came
out
of
the
bottle
consider
this
a
huge
recommendation
to
let
this
warm
and
swirl
your
glass
it
is
interesting
to
watch
new
glarus
become
more
and
more
focused
and
better
and
better
at
belgian
styles
which
many
us
craft
brewers
do
not
do
very
well
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
this
brewer
pours
a
giant
frothy
head
with
a
great
lacing
and
a
cloudy
gold
color
the
head
stays
pretty
thick
and
doesnt
dissapear
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
triple
with
some
banana
like
scents
the
taste
is
very
light
and
thicker
in
body
than
a
triple
it
has
the
backround
of
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
the
body
is
so
thick
and
smooth
and
it
goes
well
with
a
light
flavor
overall
the
drinkability
is
very
good
its
something
thats
smooth
down
the
throat
i
love
this
because
of
its
thickness
i
usually
dont
go
for
a
lighter
beer
but
this
is
thick
bodied
and
full
its
smooth
very
smooth
and
drinkable
note
i
need
to
expand
on
this
review
after
i
think
about
this
beer
my
main
thought
is
that
it
should
sit
for
about
6
months
so
that
the
carbonation
can
mellow
it
is
really
distracting

o
yes
an
8
out
of
10
seems
appropriate
for
this
brew
great
label
interesting
name
and
yet
its
a
very
simple
but
unique
brew
really
not
a
lot
going
on
but
simplicity
sometimes
hits
the
spot
for
uniqueness
saw
this
in
brussels
but
had
no
chance
to
try
it
due
to
all
the
other
options
found
this
at
yorkshire
bar
in
kunming
where
the
owner
gave
it

one
whose
alcohol
and

are
kept
well
in

which
makes
things
all
the
more
agreeable
to
this

i
may
have
to
bogart
another
of
these
little
bottles
from
my
source
o
medium
drinkability
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
dubuisson

served
in
perhaps
the
coolest
glassware
known
to
man
this
is

flavor

rather

for
such
a
strong
brew
its
not
watery
in

but
the
flavor
is
very
light
grassy
and
drinkable
but
largely
unexciting
feel
is
great
classic
belgian
effervescence
and
a
less

plenty
sessionable
in
my
opinion
despite
the
invisible

abv
overall
its
a
very
well
made
beer
lacking
somewhat

the

with
each

this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
in
my
opinion
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
tinge
of
orange
and
a
slight
hazy
transparency
has
a
nice
2
finger
head
with
a
perfect
white
head
and
a
lacing
that
tracks
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
sour
apples
lemon
peel
and
a
grassy
hay
like
aroma
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
bright
and
vibrant
lack
of
malt
favors
hurt
this
beer
and
its
too
acidic
for
my
tastes
nice
cleansing
feeling
with
the
citrus
but
overall
its
a
pass
for
me
if
i
am
looking
for
a
nice
belgian

the
nose
is

mild
with
a
strong
biscuity

the
flavor
is
an
improvement
with
an
increased
citrus
character
light
biscuity

blend
nicely
with
a

very
approachable
no
hint
of

finishes
with
a
clean

well
carbonated

overall
an
easy
drinking
belgian
for
sure
id
have
another
refreshing
overall
a
very
tasty
and
extremely
enjoyable
beer
this
sort
of
thing
is
precisely
to
my
taste
i
love
it
o
quite
a

clench
your
thirst
with

are
well
balanced

tasty
not
as
good
as
the
better

d
i
enjoyed
this
call
it
somewhere
between
duvel
single
the
green
label
and
regular
duvel
id
have
it
again
this
beer
is
a
foamy
light
golden
color
theres
some
musty
hop
aromas
both
muted
and
floral
a
light
crisp
belgian
fruitness
on
the
palate
it
has
a
smoothreal
smoothand
effervescent
finish
a
solid
if
not
terribly
exciting
expression
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
usually
enjoy
blondes
but
i
felt
that
this
beer
is
really
unbalanced
its
refreshing
to
an
extent
and
isnt
trying
to
be
something
over
the
top
but
i
could
really
do
without
that
extra
abv
here
for
the
low
price
not
a
bad
bargain
but
there
are
far
far
more
interesting
belgian
blondes
o
decent
beer
helps
that
im
drinking
it
late
at
night
in
belgium
but
compared
to
other
beers
isnt
anything
too
special
jd
this
one
was
a
letdown
i
was
expecting
way
more
from
this
one
a
supposed
limited
edition
10th
anniversary
release
o
didnt
like
it
chouffe
is
much
better
than
this
one
if
youre
not
a
sweet
tooth
steer
clear
ok
overall
marked
down
due
to
price
vs
250ml
bottle
ize
o
the
fizz
dominates
this
beer
with
soft
notes
of
hops
and
some
yeast
character
coming
through
but
not
much
this
beer
turns
a
bit

after
the

something

lots

a

not

id
go
out

out
served
at

location
poured
into
its
official
frosted
chalice
with
the

wearing

just

and
nice
bready

tones
in

mouthfeel
is
light

scary
how
pale
this
is
goes
down
really
easily
if
only
my
wallet
could
keep
up
i
believe
it
was
around
8
or
10
bucks
for
a
small
chalice
and
they
clamied
it
was
10
percent
abv
carbnoation
level
is
effervescent
goes
down
like
a

of
perry
or
carbonated

overall
impression
is
a
decent
take
at
a
belgian
pale
not
the
most
complex
or
enjoyable
version
but
decent
catch
this
one
during
happy
hour
where
beigian
drafts
are
half
off
not
a
tough
one
to
put
down
but
really
not
among
my
favorite
of
the
style
a
bit
thin
and
watery
if
this
were
more
carbonated
it
would
be
more
reminiscent
of
a
lager
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
weak
one
of
these
every
now
and
then
is
more
than
enough
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
still
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
im
not
really
impressed
with
this
d
not
particularly
spectacular
or
anything
but
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
nice
one
for
the
summer
felt
good
in
the
mouth
not
too
light
with
just
the
right
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
lovely
and
pleasant
to
drink
definitely
unusual
and
a
good
aperitifpredinner
drink
aftertaste
might
be
a
problem
after
a
while
overall
a
very
nice
surprise
and
worth
a
try
for
the
american
ipa
lover
who
wants
to
branch
into
or
revisit
the
belgian
styles
very
drinkable
very
tasty
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
lemon
zest
and
yeast
in
the
taste
lemon
zest
a
sweet
malt
and
a
small
hop
presence
a
bit
earthy
too
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
yeasty
lemon
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
saison
like
with
sweet
lemons
i
can
dig
it
d
between
the
horrible
tasteaftertaste
and
the
high
alcohol
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
md
carbonation
bit
thin
a
bit
too
alcoholic
but
what
can
you
expect
from
the
brewery
that
makes
the
most
alcoholic
beer
in
belgium
o
ok
but
not
great
the
strong
bitterness
isnt
pleasant
especially
for
the
style
which
prevents
me
from
jumping
for
this
beer
d
despite
not
having
a
great
appearance
nose
flavor
or
mouthfeel
this
one
oddly
went
down
easily
maybe
i
was
just
trying
to
finish
it
quickly
and
move
on
not
a
terrible
beer
about
the
best
compliment
i
could
give
it
now
delicious
as
expeted
cuvee
des
trolles
gets
caught
somewhere
between
a
belgian
pale
a
saison
and
a
triple
one
of
the
worst
belgian
brews
i
have
had
doverall
this
is
a
decent
bspa
its
pretty
champagnetripel
like
and
gives
the
impression
of
being
lightly
fruity
dry
and
spritzy
still
fairly
drinkable
and
well
put
together
though
not
anywhere
near
my
favorite
of
the
style
25cl
bottle
picked
this
up
in
an
auchan
in
france
this
one
poured
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
there
was
a
frothy
white
head
on
it
that
dropped
away
rather
quickly
surprisingly
lighter
aroma
a
little
yeasty
and
a
bit
grassy
maybe
some
very
faint
spice
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
also
as
is
the
taste
some
malts
breadiness
pepper
a
touch
dry
finish
certainly
not
the
best
belgian
strong
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
still
ok
i
like
the
little
troll
on
the
label
the
body
was
medium
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
dry
not
bad
overall
but
really
not
anything
that
stands
out
among
its
competition
drinkability
good
beer
from
belgium
but
overall
a
light
affair
certainly
worth
trying
out
and
decently
sessionable
despite
the
abv
d
not
a
mind
blowing
beer
but
a
nice
little
belgian
unfortunately
a
little
pricey
so
i
dont
know
if
id
bother
with
this
one
again
25
cl
is
gone
very
quickly
nice
hazy

nothing
special
with
the
aroma
a

yeasty
it
tastes
a
bit
sweet
with
bready
yeast
flavors
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
overall
a
great
beer
note
nothing
outstanding
here
but
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
really
worth
going
to
much
trouble
to
seek
it
out

the
troll
has
a
bunch
of
strong
citrus
flavor
bitter
the
taste
is
long
on
the
palate
a
pleasant
roundness
and
is
easily
tasted
the
flavor
of
orange
peel
the
power
of
these
returns
even
citrus
aftertaste
as
a
somewhat
sweet
syrup
neither
acid
nor
hot
it
offers
a
finish
of
good
bitter
hops
with
a
return
to
delay
a
beer
with
the
power
of
the
dubuisson
brewery
without
that
alcohol
is
ubiquitous
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
on
the
plain
side
dgood
sipper
and
the
light
body
makes
it
dangerously
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
lighthearted
brew
wnice

and
it
wont
kick
your
ass
like
a
lot
of
other

soft

an
easy
drinker
considering
the
abv
probably
a
touch
underrated
imo
thanks
for
getting
this
one
in
milos
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
are
exceptional
in
all
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
in
fact
the
beer
is
gone
and
resting
happily
in
my
belly
overall
decent
brew
but
not
too
special
for
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
body
will
not
refuse
another
one
though
not
the
sort
of
thing
i
would
normally
go
for
but
good
for
what
it
is
may
they
sell
many
a
troll
as
long
as
it
keeps
em
making
scaldis
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
not
one
ill
seek
out
again
good
summer
ale
beer
poured
from
tap
a
hazy
yellow
color
which
just
a
bit
of
head
nothing
altogether
of
note
in
the
smell
other
than
the
hops
taste
was
fruity
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
bitterness
the
beer
drank
easily
light
without
much
carbonation
overall
there
are
so
many
better
brews
within
the
style
still
glad
to
have
tried
just
for
the
sake
of
something
new
i
read
on
the
bottle
that
it
is
a
filtered
brew
which
might
explain
the
lack
of
depth
and
character
of
the
brew
perhaps
an
unfiltered
or
bottleconditioned
version
would
be
better
i
pour
my
cuvee
des
trolls
into
my
nifty
cuvee
des
trolls
glass
and
its
hard
to
tell
if
the
beer
is
cloudy
or
not
the
glass
is
frosted
it
seemed
fairly
clear
as
i
poured
it
there
is
a
very
white
head
nose
is
airy
barely
any
perception
of
grains
there
flavor
is
quite
sweet
at
first
a
bit
too
much
i
would
have
to
say
it
mellows
a
good
bit
but
still
remains
slightly
too
much
citrus
is
there
yes
beyond
that
there
isnt
much
the
overpowering
nature
of
the
sweetness
at
first
sets
the
tone
for
a
not
so
thrilling
ride
feel
is
full
on
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
slightly
thin
for
the
style
an
okay
beer
cool
glass
though
notes
from
61404
overall
a
very
enjoyable
experience
in
itself
that
starts
from
the
moment
you
see
the
label
until
the
last
sip
you
take
from
your
banana
perfumed
glass
will
have
again
drunk
on
the
bottle
itll
be
even
easier
a
really
nice
beer
in
deed
served
on
its
awesome
glass
its
transformed
into
a
midstrong
lightely
ambered
belgian
style
beer
but
it
can
be
compared
to
a
strong
california
ale
so
it
can
be
drunk
even
on
hot
summer
and
cold
winter
really
interesting
indeed
its
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
to
consider
this
a
belgian
strong
pale
in
the
duvel
tradition
which
this
clearly
is
not
attempting
to
be
rather
it
fits
into
the
belgian
tradition
of
not
giving
a
flying
fuck
about
style
guidelines
its
a
strong
belgian
ale
that
happens
to
be
pale
and
not
terribly
exciting
and
maybe
with
a
diacetyl
problem
thats
all
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
belgian
strong
pale
ale
d
very
drinkable
as
i
said
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
its
pleasantly
light
at
7
you
could
get
ahead
of
yourself
with
this
one
on
a
hot
day
i
like
it
give
it
a
try
there
is
a
fairly
earthy
quality
to
this
blond
ale
but
thats
where
the
distinctiveness
ends
herbal
hops
but
overall
a
quite
sweet
blond
medium
bodied
with
a
sweetish
aftertaste
nothing
earthshattering
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
on
draft
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
somewhat
unique
character
for
the
style
the
alcohol
comes
through
rather
strongly
for
a
beer
of
only
7
abv
but
somehow
this
doesnt
make
it
less
drinkable
recommended
bottle
poured
a
deep
golden
ale
with
a
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
malt
with
some
sweetness
and
some
notes
of
dry
european
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
malt
notes
with
light
bitter
and
dry
notes
of
hops
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
giving
way
to
a
nice
ring
on
the
edge
the
nose
of
the
beer
was
slightly
hoppy
and
citrus
but
subtle
as
you
dont
get
kicked
in
the
head
with
hops
as
the
label
may
have
you
believe
the
taste
is
also
not
overly
hopped
there
is
a
slight
malt
character
and
hops
notes
to
round
out
a
decent
beer
on
a
final
note
the
higher
than
usual
abv
wasnt
even
noticed
during
my
tasting
session
another
big
plus
for
this
beer
d
very
approachable
and
for
a
strong
ale
quite
moreish
taste
is
yeasty
with
some
solvent
and
fruity
peach
notes
there
is
a
light
bitter
and
malt
is
faintly
present
a
light
spiciness
in
the
back
actually
there
were
no
real
complex
flavors
in
this
beers
the
yeast
wasnt
really
special
and
hops
and
malt
were
not
very
outspoken
body
was
kind
of
thin
just
a
standard
blond
beer
nothing
special
and
this
was
a
very
fresh
brew
thanks
to
my
great
son
studying
overseas
in
amsterdam
i
was
sent
this
for
the
unique
chance
to
enjoy
direct
from
the
brewer
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
cuvee
de
troll
was
a
beer
i
found
hard
to
conclude
anything
on
i
had
almost
written
it
off
after
my
first
few
sips
but
as
i
got
further
in
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
more
not
a
particularly
complex
beer
especially
not
for
a
belgian
but
it
was
certainly
not
bad
flavours
were
hard
to
pin
point
as
though
present
were
not
at
all
bold
some
grainy
malt
light
pepeery
spice
a
lingering
dry
finish
faint
alcohol
with
some
fruity
airness
what
i
would
consider
a
decent
aroma
and
mouthfeel
as
well
average
bouquet
with
neutral
texture
and
carbonation
overall
it
was
enjoyable
but
not
rememberable
all
the
same
a
good
job
by
the
dubuissons

the
problem
with
this
beer
was
that
at
least
for
me
it
was
good
but
unmemorable
then
again
after
an
evening
at
smokeless
joe
you
have
to
expect
things
to
become
a
little
unmemorable
will
review
again
at
some
point
to
make
sure
im
not
imagining
things
d
certainly
approachable
but
i
didnt
find
it
overly
engaging
typical
pale
belgian
in
appearance
frosted
glass
dedicated
cuvee
des
trolls
glass
who
could
resists
trolls
apple
and
soy
sauce
aromas
the
apples
also
show
up
in
the
flavour
along
with
sweetness
some
yeastiness
grain
and
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
little
bit
boozy
and
drying
not
the
most
flavourful
for
the
style
but
refreshing
wouldnt
regret
having
another
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
this
would
definitely
be
a
pleaser
amongst
a
variety
of
beer
enthusiasts
as
its
not
your
typical
pale
ale
it
really
has
something
all
its
own
another
fantastic
beer
from
the
dubuisson
brewery
this
brew
if
you
can
track
down
a
bottle
is
liquid
gold
im
in
love
drinkability
excellently
smooth
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
to
me
this
beer
tastes
like
a
better
version
of
the
bush
blonde
that
stands
at

at

this
tastes
like
a
more
realistic
and
natural
interpretation
of
the
same
beer
i
tasted
the
two
beers
side
by
side
and
i
definately
prefer
this
cuvée

nothing

some

nice

at
the
glas
futher
an
opalizing
golden
beecolor
nose
is
quiet
flat
maybe
cause
of
age
having
some
malts
but
lots
of
esters
giving
it
a
fruity
nose
and
a
hint
of
hoparome
overal
not
100
fresh
though
taste
is
quiet
dull
too
having
some
malttaste
quiet
sweet
alcoholic
and
then
going
into
a
moderate
but
litle
hanging
bitterness
lots
of
carbonisation
makes
mouthfeel
more
lively
and
litle
better
then
taste
but
one
was
enough
for
me
no
bad
beer
though
pours
a
hazy
golden
into
its
distinctive
frosted

which
makes
in
a
little
difficult
to
rate
its

floral

taste
was
a
lot
of
piney
hops
and
some

was

the
hops
yet
still
quite
smooth
quite
a
duality
i
had
had
a
few
too
many
by
the
time
i
had
this
so
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
just
to
make
sure
my
notes
are
correct
the
beer
disembarks
the
330ml

a
slightly

a
middling

as
it
evaporates
the
resultant

forms
a
thin

the

nose
is
fruity
nice
malt
crisp
and
clean
to
the
senses
with
the
start
ambrosial

presence
and
the

has
a
benign
acidity
the

this

it

thats
what
we

very

with

very
little

at

a

not
like

there
is
not
many

make
it
compairable

it

has
a

less
dried

some
citrus
hints
and
frankly
its
rather
sour
and
theres
not

of

o

t
first
thing
that
i
experience
was
a
slight
yeasty
spice
at
the
back
of
my
tongue
followed
by
a
rounded
citrus
orange
and
a
note
of
coriander
the
first
belgian
singel
ive
ever
had
or
seen
this
pours
out
almost
like
a
wit
beer
cloudy
and
pale
yellow
thin
white
head
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
kind
of
citrusy
but
also
a
bit
light
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
kind
of
one
dimentional
to
me
there
was
no
transitions
here
it
tastes
similar
to
a
weisse
beer
but
doesnt
really
have
much
of
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
thin
i
thought
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
not
something
ill
be
getting
more
of
pours
a
murky
pale
yellow
color
with
a
huge
3
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
little
spots
of
lacing
here
and
there
on
the
glass
smells
like
this
one
might
be
infected
as
there
is
a
noticeable
dirty
socks
smell
coming
off
this
beer
i
am
also
getting
some
citrus
taste
is
actually
not
half
bad
there
are
some
grain
flavors
like
water
logged
biscuits
with
a
lemony
citrus
finish
there
is
a
citrus
zest
essence
on
the
finish
but
without
any
bitterness
this
beer
is
pretty
flat
and
watery
in
the
feel
overall
i
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
one
not
too
impressed

a
tasty

we
have

it
has
a
hazy
goldenyellow
pour
with
lots
of
head
and
carbonation
it
never
really
goes
away
there
are
aromas
of
overripe
fruit
with
a
mor
lemoncitrus
note
than
anything
there
are
malts
and
yeast
in
the
aroma
as
well
but
it
really
smelled
like
it
came
out
of
a
dank
dark
attic
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
the
taste
is
very
sour
with
malts
and
yeast
loitering
around
the
citrus
zone
terrific
on
the
drinkability
meter
clean
tasty
and
smooth
taste
was
more
of
that
honey
dominant
than
anything
then
some
dried
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
basic
malt
character
again
not
bad
but
fairly
unexciting
jd
drinkability
is
really
great
this
is
more
of
a
sipper
though
as
opposed
to
a
chugger
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
deserves
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
with
friends
definitely
worth
the
price

froth
that

immense

a

vinous
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
sourness
and
perhaps
some
spicy
hops
similar
on
the

with
notes
of
pale
malt
a
mild
bitterness
and
a
distracting
cardboard
flavor
on
top
of
a
light
and
dry
highlycarbonated
body
certainly
a
passable
pale
but
i
wish
it
had
more
character
d
this
beer
will
appeal
to
those
who
like
their
beer
a
bit
spicey
hoppy
d
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
forgettable
but
still
good
an
extremely
light
flavored
beer
but
still
has
some
of
the
belgian
characteristics
i
love
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
id
recommend
it
di
like
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
because
it
is
so
diffrent
overall
impression
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
tasty
for
the
style
carbonation
is
too
high
by
far
d
very
refreshing
and
lively
brew
drink
this
one
cold
and
it
will
surprise
you
i
enjoyed
drinking
half
of
this
beer
for
the
experience
its
so
pungent
i
laughed
out
loud
its
always
fun
to
be
exposed
to
a
radically
different
flavor
profile
than
youre
used
to
but
this
isnt
a
beer
thats
aligned
with
my
personal
tastes
drinkability
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
beer
its
interesting
flavor
keeps
me
going
back
to
the
well
and
its
refreshing
character
make
me
want
to
quaff
a
few
more
of
these
overall
an
average
belgian
blonde
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
light
but
with
enough
complexity
to
be
interesting
notes
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
almost
like
the
belgian
equivalent
to
a
kolsch
if
it
werent
so
expensive
i
would
buy
it
again
because
of
its
uniqueness
but
it
really
isnt
worth
the
price
overall
its
not
the
beer
i
would
trade
for
but
if
you
can
have
one
on
a
hot
day
give
it
a
try
i
had
this
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
at
hopleaf
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yeasty
medium
gold
with
an
unreal
white
head
it
foams
up
at
least
five
fingers
requiring
three
different
pours
to
finally
finish
it
off
the
head
is
not
only
big
but
lasts
several
minutes
and
is
very
puffy
and
nice
to
look
at
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
nice
what
you
would
expect
out
of
belgian
pale
ale
nothing
more
or
less
easy
drinker
but
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
d
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
its
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
bought
it
for
the
interesting
label
received
as
gift
thanks
todd
overall
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
in
it
the
texture
was
not
good
and
the
taste
and
smell
brought
nothing
special
to
the
table
i
did
enjoy
it
just
not
as
much
as
others
in
the
style
well
at
least
the
beer
starts
out
finishing
good
there
is
a
strong
funk
and
woodsey
taste
to
this
beer
it
is
medium
bodied
and
as
you
drink
the
finishing
well
dissipates
i
dont
know
if
theres
an
odd
bitterness
that
is
just
growing
or
my
tolerance
for
the
funk
is
going
down
i
did
not
enjoy
nor
will
i
order
this
beer
again
a
singleserve
bottle
bought
a
few
months
ago
poured
fridgecold
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
comes
on
strawcolored
and
a
little
cloudy
looking
almost
like
a
wit
with
a
thin
layer
of
creamy
head
the
nose
was
of
straw
and
grass
a
bouquet
garnis
of
other
herbs
some
peach
fruit
and
maybe
some
blossom
with
it
in
the
mouth
the
perception
was
of
immediate
effervesecence
making
for
shortlived
flavor
impressions
of
peachy
sweetness
coriander
maybe
some
other
herbs
arranged
on
a
thin
backbone
of
hops
the
cleansing
feeling
makes
this
quite
quaffable
the
witkap
singel
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
thick
frothy
whitest
of
white
heads
that
laces
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
earthy
some
yeasts
are
also
noticeable
in
the
nose
quaff
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
musky
yeast
finish
the
taste
is
also
quite
dry
and
has
some
notes
of
haygrains
mouthfeel
is
mildly
creamy
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
dry
quite
the
different
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
belgian
ales
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
this
packs
a
6
abv
punch
with
a
pretty
good
taste
makes
it
sessionable
to
a
lover
of
this
style
the
4
price
tag
diminishes
the
drinkability
somewhat
overall
good
belgian
single
that
i
am
glad
i
could
sample
feel
and
drinkability
overall
this
is
one
simple
and
very
drinkable
beer
this
goes
down
real
easy
and
i
could
see
myself
being
able
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
might
be
a
good
one
to
go
with
everyday
meals
however
for
what
this
retails
at
around
1718
a
four
pack
its
not
worth
it
this
one
has
a
lightmedium
body
and
very
low
carbonation
it
goes
down
real
easy
and
is
semidry
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
its
definitely
not
worth
the
price
i
doubt
i
ever
buy
this
beer
nothing
special
nothing
to
brag
about
not
really
worth
talking
about
anymore
drinkability
a
good
one
to
keep
on
hand
d
this
is
another
great
belgian
ale
it
was
a
treat
to
find
it
on
tap
at
cafe
hollander
in
milwaukee
easy
drinking
not
bad
at
all
note
bottle
says
the
ingredients
are
malt
corn
hop
yeast
d
smooth
drink
and
very
drinkable
the
drinkability
is
good
and
sure
to
please
fans
of
the
style
decent
enough
easy
to
drink
and
inoffensive
eh
no
thanks
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
with
so
many
other
great
belgians
out
there
im
inclined
to
pass
on
this
one
as
far
as
singles
go
this
beer
is
of
fair
strength
i
might
lean
towards
others
of
its
kind
before
picking
this
one
up
again
drinkability
not
a
bad
belgian
pale
i
could
see
putting
these
away
quite
handily
if
i
ever
get
to
belgium
and
this
sort
of
thing
is
widely
available
the
metallic
finish
was
a
big
turnoff
for
me
sadly
it
overshadowed
all
other
character
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
crisp
and
well
done
belgian
pale
worth
a
shot
while
thirst
quenching
the
flavor
and
aromas
of
this
beer
simply
fail
to
impress
me
another
belgian
i
was
disappointed
in
just
not
a
beer
id
like
to
sit
around
and
knock
back
with
my
buds
nice
decent
head
that
sticks
around
light
golden
color
very
spicy
with
a
strong
lemon
flavor
you
can
smell
the
belgian
style
yeast
on
it
with
very
little
hops
to
it
oh
theres
also
some
lime
its
very
interesting
and
quite
good
d
a
weird
beer
i
was
all
over
the
place
with
how
much
i
cared
for
it
during
the
drinking
experience
something
to
try
out
33cl
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
nice
lacing
smells
quite
floral
and
citric
backed
by
notes
of
soft
grain
and
honey
spicy
the
taste
is
slightly
more
restrained
with
lemony
notes
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
nice
grainy
malt
character
spicy
yeast
notes
definite
hop
presence
that
lends
not
only
good
grassy
notes
but
also
slight
bitterness
the
light
body
and
effervescence
work
well
a
really
pleasant
beer
overall
that
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
chimay
glass
from
a
33l
bottle
purchased
at
julios
liquors
in
worcester
it
has
a
sizable
head
with
nice
lacing
down
the
side
the
color
is
very
similar
to
that
of
hoegaarden
or
any
witbier
obviously
being
a
very
hazy
form
of
yellow
the
taste
is
unfortunately
rather
metallic
and
only
segways
into
an
even
worse
aftertaste
when
eaten
with
salty
foods
this
beer
could
hardly
be
distinguished
from
the
juice
in
a
pickle
jar
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
duppel
and
tripel
had
a
bottle
in
ghent
appeared
a
hazy
amber
in
the
chalice
with
a
white
head
this
was
a
nice
chage
of
pace
for
the
seemingly
hoppy
aroma
or
soft
citrus
fruit
and
mellon
this
continued
into
the
flavor
along
with
a
bit
of
belgian
spice
and
malt
making
for
an
all
together
excellent
belgian
pale
ale
very
drinkable
and
tasty
give
this
a
try
the
drink
is
light
and
crisp
with
excellent
carbonation
and
were
it
the
stuff
that
it
smells
and
tastes
most
like
witkappater
abbey
singel
it
would
easily
be
the
most
drinkable
yeast
rollale
i
have
ever
encountered
tastes
light
firm
and
delicious
solvent
spices
in
back
lemon
peel
nicely
medicinal
like
some
kind
of
homeopathic
footrub
refreshing
to
say
the
least
off
the
tap
at
american
flatbread
this
beer
was
a
hazy
lemonyellowgold
color
the
head
was
an
offwhite
color
twofingers
large
the
retention
good
and
the
lacing
in
broken
bands
the
aroma
was
delicious
a
true
bouquet
of
floral
hops
dry
grains
citrus
coriander
and
a
general
semisweet
spiciness
the
flavors
were
complex
citrus
hops
notes
first
and
some
citrus
rind
bitterness
followed
by
spices
white
pepper
coriander
and
vanilla
then
a
wheat
twang
towards
the
end
similar
to
seltzer
water
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
soft
and
the
carbonation
light
drinkability
good
drinkability
but
definitely
not
worth
the
18
dollar
per
4pack
asking
price
no
head
on
this
one
but
the
brew
is
highly
carbonated
d
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
is
producing
a
floating
layer
of
foam
but
thats
about
it
pale
yellow
in
color
belgian
malts
and
hops
on
the
nose
fairly
boring
on
the
tongue
not
the
best
tasting
ive
had
from
slaghmuylder
tastes
like
carbonated
water
with
just
a
little
beer
injected
too
carbonated
if
anything
id
try
this
again
but
only
to
make
sure
this
wasnt
a
bad
brew
after
that
id
surely
pass
on
this
one
i
bought
this
at
beer
mania
in
brussels
and
brought
it
home
in
my
wooden
leg
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
lots
of
citrus
on
the
nose
especially
sweet
orange
with
some
floral
notes
citurs
flavors
also
dominate
sweet
orange
and
grapefruit
bitter
lemon
with
some
passion
fruit
and
bubblegum
flavors
as
well
light
body
medium
carbonation
with
an
extremely
dry
finish
the
mix
of
flavors
makes
you
crave
another
sip
pour
a
light
straw
lightly
cloudy
a
small
head
that
quickly
becomes
a
ring
around
the
edge
grass
and
fruity
cirtus
not
the
type
one
would
expect
with
hops
but
with
fruit
sitting
in
the
esters
taste
is
sweeter
but
not
too
sweet
refreshing
light
hop
and
note
of
tangerine
juice
the
fruit
make
it
crisp
not
dry
its
herbal
but
not
dense
with
herbalness
and
hop
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
bpa
balance
of
floral
hop
spice
and
ester
the
fruit
give
it
a
lighter
body
has
a
very
light
malt
flavor
very
refreshing
will
have
again
before
summer
is
out
not
a
go
to
for
belgian
hoppiness
alcohol
wellcovered
and
a
hit
of
the
spiciness
lingers
for
a
bit
but
overall
not
much
is
going
on
here
that
would
really
make
this
shine
plenty
of
better
pale
ales
from
belgium
out
there
imo
pours
pee
yellow
with
white
foam
riding
atop
nose
is
very
citrus
heavy
and
refreshing
goes
down
in
giant
gulps
with
no
alcohol
burn
you
can
really
get
into
the
flavors
provided
by
the
belgian
yeast
i
like
it
as
a
good
summer
beer
or
a
good
subtle
intro
into
belgian
beer
d
good
drinkability
refreshing
but
more
suited
as
a
summer
quaffer
and
drank
more
like
a
blonde
exquisite
beer
seductive
array
of
flavors
crept
up
on
me
and
drew
me
in
like
the
nectar
of
a
siren
no
negative
side
effects
as
of
yet
drinkable
not

overall
im
smitten
with
this
beer
ive
dabbled
and
sipped
this
classic
throughout
the
years
but
never
got
serious
to
contemplate
and
formally
review
it
the
delicate
spice
ripe
tartness
chalky
dryness
subtle
sweetness
and
kinetic
ultra
fine
carbonation
really
do
make
this
a
sensational
ale
i
do
believe
ive
found
my
perfect
session
belgian
ale
d
notes
a
decent
beer
that
is
fairly
unique
the
big
flavor
characteristic
is
sourbitter
which
cant
remember
tasting
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
though
the
style
is
kind
of
a
catch
all
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
a
more
sweet
and
malty
flavor
cinnamon
buns
caramelized
pineapples
pears
and
clove
the
flavor
is
subtle
and
smooth
with
a
carbon
dioxide
overtone
to
the
crisp
drink
i
feel
like
i
can
taste
the
raw
water
that
was
used
when
this
was
brewed
very
clean
and
mineral
in
character
as
the
beer
warms
i
taste
the
more
complex
bready
malt
come
through
this
is
an
interesting
beer
a
little
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
helps
a
bit
quite
drinkable
as
well
pours
a
cloudy
strawgold
with
a
sizeable
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
almost
sour
possibly
like
a
sweet
sourdough
what
an
interesting
flavor
edge
to
it
there
are
many
different
things
coming
together
here
in
an
odd
way
but
not
in
a
particularly
light
one
it
is
somewhat
smooth
but
definitely
unfiltered
i
get
a
bit
of
hearty
yeast
and
a
thick
malt
edge
definitely
a
unique
combination
of
flavors
but
not
something
i
would
ever
go
back
to
feel
is
typical
for
the
style
edit
almost
forgot
to
mention
that
my
bottle
was
actually
filled
all
of
the
way
to
the
top
there
was
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
air
right
under
the
cap
thought
that
was
a
bit
unusual
dont
know
if
that
is
the
norm
for
them
or
if
it
was
an
oddball
overall
this
was
a
good
bit
above
decent
for
a
nice
belgian
now
it
was
nothing
explosive
or
out
of
this
world
but
the
again
understated
palate
really
showcased
what
a
finely
crafter
beer
can
be
like
i
am
not
going
to
say
this
was
the
best
thing
i
have
ever
had
but
it
was
certainly
no
where
near
the
worst
a
very
well
crafted
and
nice
little
belgian
i
would
order
this
again
if
i
saw
it
drinkability
mais
on
pourrait
espérer
mieux
dune
abbaye
manque
un
peu
de
profondeur
pours
a
pale
cloudy
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
aroma
is
nice
and
fruity
with
hints
of
apple
and
raisin
in
the
nose
taste
is
very
mild
and
fruity
with
a
grapefruitlike
aftertaste
goes
down
smooth
a
second
sip
confirms
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
and
how
balanced
it
is
a
decent
introduction
to
the
style
that
doesnt
overwhelm
in
any
aspect
33cl
bottle
pours
very
pale
straw
with
a
head
that
its
just
not
serious
enough
about
to
keep
for
any
amount
of
time
very
odd
looking
for
anything
abbey
id
have
to
say
the
smell
is
apples
lemongrass
and
peaches
nice
like
a
trippel
with
a
hint
of
something
rosemaryish
the
taste
is
crisp
at
first
then
funky
sour
finish
has
a
lambicesque
quality
but
not
nearly
so
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
but
slick
enough
to
hold
it
together
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
the
odd
sour
but
not
like
we
meant
it
finish
is
the
limiting
factor
for
my
limited
palate
definitely
worth
a
try
i
dont
think
shakespeare
had
this
beer
in
mind
where
other
small
beers
lack
flavor
and
style
this
one
keeps
an
earthy
base
while
reaching
for
the
sublime
beer
is
ultimately
clean
and
easy
a
great
session
or
pairing
with
fish
or
salad
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
easier
on
the
pocket
book
this
beer
poured
pale
and
golden
with
a
tall
foamy
head
the
smell
carried
yeasts
and
light
citrus
accents
the
flavor
was
light
in
intensity
but
moderately
complex
its
flavors
were
hoppy
yeasty
somewhat
spicycloves
mild
citrus
bittersweetness
and
very
light
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
light
and
refreshing
with
a
reasonable
level
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
the
carbonation
pops
in
your
mouth
the
tang
keeps
you
coming
back
sort
of
light
bodied
too
its
good
but
nothing
id
really
try
again
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
go
get
my
own
nice
beer
though
a
bit
pricy
it
was
decently
drinkable
and
nice
to
sip
but
although
refreshing
it
was
mediocre
at
best
yummy
and
easy
taste
is
hoppy
and
bitter
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
from
the
smell
the
tartness
is
not
there
i
must
have
mistaken
the
tart
smell
for
the
dryness
and
hoppiness
of
the
beer
a
thin
body
fits
the
style
saison
and
fits
this
beer
a
beautiful
spicy
light
fruity
slightly
phenolic
beer
with
a
great
balance
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
dry
great
stuff
witkap
pater
singel
paired
well
with
an
aged
white
cheddar
d
very
refreshing
a
fantastic
summer
beer
that
was
a
pleasure
to
try
on
draft
d
pretty
good
this
is
one
of
the
nicest
smelling
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
so
i
would
buy
it
again
just
for
that
the
flavors
just
dont
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
though
and
i
think
that
the
citrus
aspects
just
dont
mesh
well
with
the
sweet
honeycandy
flavors
md
slightly
fizzy
for
my
taste
initially
but
the
mouthfeel
quickly
turns
softer
while
the
palate
is
consistently
crisp
and
dry
even
a
bit
tangy
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
reasonably
complexyeasty
sample
of
this
style
and
quite
a
moreish
and
quaffable
one
in
warmer
seasons
to
me
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
zesty
in
the
beginning
and
finished
rather
thin
and
smooth
a
rather
unusualtasting
belgian
ale
yet
an
enjoyable
one
probably
for
the
more
adventurous
drinkers
in
general
but
those
who
enjoy
belgian
ales
should
definitely
try
this
alternating
sip
to
sip
i
either
praised
the
refreshing
qualities
of
this
beer
or
cursed
its
funk
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
an
aquired
or
preferential
taste
and
well
crafted
admittedly
i
did
not
pair
it
with
food
which
may
or
may
not
help
it
ive
got
a
few
more
ill
have
to
give
it
a
go
this
poured
a
very
hazy
blonde
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
good
webbing
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
citrusy
fruits
mixed
with
some
spices
light
and
enticing
fruity
in
taste
with
a
hint
of
a
mellow
souring
combined
with
a
slight
spicy
kick
to
compliment
the
flavor
well
balanced
and
pleasant
in
the
mouth
to
create
an
exceptional
smootness
a
great
beer
to
be
enjoyed
yearround
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
my
snifter
a
cloudy
orangish
color
with
a
big
white
fluffy
head
that
leaves
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
with
malt
and
fruits
taste
crisp
with
a
short
burst
of
pale
flavors
of
malt
and
hops
that
finish
clean
with
very
little
after
taste
it
is
also
well
carbonated
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
well
crafted
brew
but
a
little
to
pale
for
my
taste
to
make
this
a
regular
got
to
beer
poured
into
oversized
wineglass
two
centimeter
thick
white
head
leaving
lacing
the
body
is
a
hazy
golden
with
orange
peachish
high
lights
smells
of
pale
fruit
esters
predominantly
pear
with
hints
of
apple
and
strawberry
a
little
upstaged
by
clove
pepper
and
as
it
warms
slightly
yeasty
scents
taste
is
fresh
with
a
crisp
juicy
pear
character
there
is
a
slight
tartness
and
a
dry
apple
or
pear
finish
medium
light
mouthfeel
and
i
assume
that
since
it
is
a
single
like
the
refectory
beer
the
monks
ate
with
this
would
be
a
really
nice
food
beer
especially
with
cheese
and
bread
or
crackers
i
dig
this
definitely
not
an
evening
closer
more
of
a
lunch
or
even
starting
dinner
drink
but
just
the
same
this
is
a
very
subtle
easy
going
belgian
pale
id
buy
again
cloudy
and
yet
transclucent
golden
with
abundant
and
drinkable
white
mushroom
cap
of
a
head
mild
yeasty
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
and
a
bit
on
fruity
yeasty
side
a
bit
drying
finish
bitterness
and
sweetness
in
aftertaste
from
malts
i
could
have
this
again
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
pale
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
is
well
worth
a
try
the
sour
fruit
notes
really
give
this
brew
a
different
taste
beer
poured
into
chalice
at
50
degrees
beer
was
cloudy
and
smelled
like
fresh
bake
bread
with
a
little
fruity
background
smell
taste
was
yeastyfruity
and
a
little
peppery
twas
a
good
abbey
and
if
offered
one
i
would
take
it
but
i
will
still
most
likely
not
purchase
again
drinkability
spicy
and
fruity
not
overdone
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
pale
ale
there
are
better
examples
out
there
but
its
certainly
worth
a
try
the
carbonation
is
sharp
and
crisp
accentuating
the
beautiful
floral
hops
very
highly
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
the
tripel
which
i
also
purchased
along
with
this
i
think
the
real
beauty
behind
this
beer
however
is
its
drinkability
which
may
be
lost
with
a
stronger
style
a
great
beer
and
i
thought
i
was
a
hop
head
an
easy
to
drink
belgian
ale
that
i
would
drink
again
this
was
a
decent
belgium
even
though
i
dont
like
them
this
one
was
quite
good
incredible
lacing
if
i
must
say
with
some
aged
cheese
the
tastes
of
this
beer
trully
come
out
nice
malts
and
overall
aroma
made
it
tasty
never
heard
of
a
single
from
belgium
so
this
is
fairly
interesting
definetly

this

lots
of

the
aroma
was

the
taste
was
of
caramel
and
apples
with
a
tart

what
is

i
could

this

but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
an
extreme
sessionability
cold

erupted
when
i
popped

hazy

colored
beer
was
poured
quickly
into
a
goblet
big
foamy
bright
white
colored
head
faded
slowly
to
a
dense
film
leaving
a
few
strings
of
lace
behind
sour
lemon
and
a
pinch
of
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
pretty
one
dimensional
mostly
sour
lemon
with
a
bit
of
candied
fruit
this
beer
is
full
of
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
froathy
mouthfeel
it
tastes
like
something
between
a
saison
and
a
lambic
its
interesting
but
not
what
i
thought
i
was
getting
and
not
something
i
would
drink
again
this
one
is
a
unique
beer
just
too
sweet
for
me
overall
its
a
rarely
known
bit
of
belgiumbeergeekdom
that
slaghmuylder
who
are
still
family
owned
can
lay
claim
to
producing
the
first
ever
abbey
beer
because
the
witkap
brews
were
first
produced
by
an
exwestmalle
brewer
back
in
the
1920s
slaghmuylder
first
brewed
the
witkaps
in
1979
and
now
own
the
witkap
brand
there
arent
that
many
abbey
singles
fewer
worthy
of
special
note
but
this
is
one
of
them
only
cost
me
3
49
for
the
privilege
damned
fine
stuff
well
worth
seeking
out
body
is
a
little
thin
but
good
nevertheless
i
prefer
other
examples
of
the
style
this
would
be
a
good
crossover
for
someon
i
believe
someone
looking
to
get
into
belgians
this
would
ease
someone
into
the
style
drinkability
and
overall
a
very
good
single
with
enough
drinkability
to
be
sipped
on
all
day
definitly
recommended
if
you
want
a
quality
belgian
session
ale
back
to
the
beer
this
is
a
unique
smelling
beer
it
took
a
few
smells
to
pinpoint
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
barn
but
the
flavor
which
is
smooth
and
green
beer
is
good
happy
belg
pale
beering
overall
a
decent
belgian
with
some
bonus
marks
for
a
unique
flavor
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
between
sweet
fruit
and
some
tart
notes
throughout
a
very
nice
beer
a
good
mildly
flavored
belgian
beer
here
this
would
go
good
with
other
mild
flavors
like
raw
vegetables
without
strong
sauces
or
dressings
the
low
alcohol
rating
also
makes
this
a
super
choice
for
lunch
when
you
have
to
go
back
to
work
d
quite
drinkable
but
gassy
witkappater
abbey
singel
looks
fabulous
smells
good
tastes
pretty
good
and
feels
just
okay
the
long
slow
slide
is
saved
in
the
end
by
an
upturn
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
despite
my
complaints
this
is
an
impressively
quaffable
beer
they
mow
lawns
in
belgium
dont
they
the
carbonation
is
on
high
gear
but
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
smoothness
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
like
to
have
more
flavor
so
but
on
your
hoody
and
enjoy
a
pale
with
interesting
flavors
just
not
as
balanced
as
i
wouldve
liked
nice
to
try
but
one
to
avoid
in
the
future
a
sweet
fruity
almost
ciderlike
flavor
and
aroma
dominates
but
the
malt
and
hops
are
balanced
nicely
with
everything
in
the
foreground
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
robust
given
the
great
depth
of
flavor
here
plus
the
2
49bottle
price
tag
i
could
easily
see
myself
returning
to
this
beer
many
times
again
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
that
great
and
nothing
i
would
seek
out
drinkability
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
drink
this
one
on
the
cooler
side
towards
the
end
it
starts
to
take
on
the
taste
of
a
watery
green
banana
beer
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
spectacularly
effervescent
and
light
dreamy
clouds
float
all
around
your
mouth
highly
refreshing
definately
recommended
clear
gold
in
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
and
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
aroma
is
spicy
with
some
orange
citric
notes
spiciness
dominates
the
flavor
as
well
heavy
on
the
cloves
but
with
noticeable
coriander
and
orange
peel
flavors
as
well
bubbles
dance
on
the
tongue
giving
the
beer
a
light
tingly
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
flavors
are
light
as
well
nicely
tart
and
citrusy
with
a
wimpy
malt
backbone
wimpy
works
here
and
would
make
you
question
the
6
alcvol
as
does
the
light
body
and
mouth
feel
wheat
notes
blend
well
with
the
pale
malt
sweetness
im
assuming
there
is
wheat
in
here
if
not
nice
trick
dry
mildly
hoppy
finish
with
a
tasty
lingering
bitterness
now
this
is
a
session
beer
average
belgian
pale
not
very
interesting
to
me
pours
and
it
looks
clear
and
yellow
like
an
adjunct
lager
but
with
a
good
head
smell
is
slightly
spicy
but
not
much
there
taste
is
a
touch
tart
some
spice
but
bland
mouthfeel
is
good
for
style
very
carbonated
but
not
overcarbonated
okay
but
not
great
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
poor
mans
duvel
less
hoppy
less
alcoholic
less
head
but
more
expensive
so
i
guess
it
isnt
really
a
poor
mans
duvel
a
good
beer
nonetheless
and
worth
a
try
drinkable
this
is
not
a
top
level
classic
beer
but
it
is
very
tasty
and
i
really
enjoy
it
the
drinkability
is
great
could
be
a
session
beer
since
the
aftertaste
does
not
linger
however
the
6
0
av
may
limit
the
session
feel
is
well
carbonated
with
a
fluffy
medium
body
that
plays
off
the
dry
crispness
which
seems
to
really
keep
a
good
hold
without
getting
to
strong
like
some
wines
or
overly
yeasty
ales
a
good
little
drinker
thats
smooth
dry
crisp
and
fruity
with
just
enough
play
of
yeast
and
phenol
things
to
keep
you
intrigued
to
continue
til
the
glass
sits
empty
personally
i
really
like
this
beer
not
sure
if
i
am
getting
the
intended
flavors
but
i
still
like
it
drinkability
very
easy
going
a
dirty
strawcolored
beer
hazy
cloudy
on
last
pour
with
big
dark
chunks
foamy
white
head
leaves
arcs
of
lacing
some
tangy
citrus
and
pepper
in
the
nose
taste
is
pleasant
yeasty
mildly
spicy
some
nice
fruit
finish
is
quite
bitter
with
buttery
grains
its
very
witlike
a
nice
pleasant
mild
fruity
bready
belgian
the
taste
was
of
strong
smooth
wheat
slightly
nutty
quite
well
balanced
i
must
say
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
it
delivered
a
memorable
experience
that
i
enjoyed
pours
a
deep
blond
with
a
little
orange
tint
with
a
nice
sticky
head
that
takes
awhile
to
leaveget
a
nice
big
green
apple
note
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
yeastyspiceness
wich
was
expected
taste
is
fruity
more
citruisy
than
apple
with
a
nice
level
of
spiceness
and
pretty
tart
in
the
abrupt
finish
a
pretty
nice
beer
very
solid
and
will
buy
again
this
belgian
seems
to
be
crafted
as
a
saison
or
session
ale
if
you
can
adapt
to
the
wool
blanket
yeastiness
you
can
enjoy
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
a
nice
brew
with
some
interesting
elements
going
on
its
belgian
alright
but
its
not
overthetop
and
its
light
body
makes
it
a
good
crossover
beer
for
those
getting
into
the
belgian
lambics
think
of
this
as
a
cross
between
a
lambic
and
abbey
single

with
a
nice

very
tiny

which
reduces
to
a
thin
film
and
leaves
a
lot
of
intricate

first
tastes
i
get
are
a
delicate
powdered
sugar
nose
and
then
interestingly

alot

going

so
this
one
would
be
fairly
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
so
complex
i
like
this
beer
a
good
one
to
try
on
a
belgian
newbie
cuz
its
got
the
belgian
flavorsyeast
and
complexity
but
its
not
super
strong
this
would
be
great
also
with
heartyflavorful
salads
breads
nuts
and
cheese
straw
color
chill
haze
a
fine
white
rocky
head
and
light
effervescence
it
has
a
sticky
lacy
and
retains
a
fine
layer
after
the
head
diminishes
the
aroma
is
primarily
of
hops
and
some
malt
but
is
also
tart
with
a
bready
background
the
flavor
has
a
slight
sweet
start
with
a
tart
yet
spicy
middle
and
a
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with

a
hazed
fizzy
golden
straw
color
with
a
bif
white
head
mellow
yet
spicey
sweet
yet
dry
balance
is
quite
right
hops
and
malts
are
in
check
with
each
other
yeast
flavor
is
there
too
complex
but
not
overly
so
a
solid
belgian
which
i
am
glad
is
now
available
in
vt
make
sure
to
decant
the
yeast
with
the
bottle
on
this
one
or
itll
seem
a
little
bland
murky
pale
golden
with
darker
colored
yeast
in
suspension
effervescent
foamy
white
head
thatll
dissipate
promptly
of
you
use
the
proper
chalice
leaving
a
nice
lace
peppery
citrusy
zesty
and
musty
aromas
are
right
in
front
even
smells
effervescent
taste
is
a
different
story
very
tart
lime
citrusy
tang
mixed
with
some
yeasty
funkiness
in
the
beginning
going
toward
a
musty
drier
finish
the
only
malt
presence
i
could
discern
was
a
mild
tea
sweetness
in
the
middle
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
ive
tried
older
bottles
and
liked
those
better
but
regardless
i
guess
i
could
say
that
i
like
this
beer
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
like
duvel
or
a
saisonstyle
or
orval
very
tasty
in
goes
the
yeast
the
brew
goes
from
the
bubbly
gold
to
a
very
light
orange
color
very
cloudy
and
the
bubbles
are
harder
to
see
nose
remains
the
same
but
the
yeast
gives
this
one
a
more
complex
flavor
no
surprise
there
stronger
citrus
flavors
and
a
creamier
mouthfeel
result
from
the
yeast
mmm
yeast
pour
the
yeast
in
on
this
one
a
tasty
belgian
white
indeed
big
white
head
on
an
active
golden
liquid
very
pretty
with
all
this
great
lace
almost
a
five
very
spicy

due

and
this
beers
intreguing
properties
i
have
to
say
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
that
drinkability
score
is
just
5
higher
because
its
sessionable
despite
its
being
complex
poured
a
cloudy
gold
color
i
has
similar
characteristics
of
a
wheat
beer
when
pouring
very
thin
head
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottle
of
the
glass
not
a
potent
hoppy
smell
but
present
almost
had
citrus
and
grass
smell
very
sweet
tasting
kind
of
suprising
at
first
almost
tart
tasting
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
sweet
tarts
candy
or
red
bull
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
drinkability
is
enjoyable
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
on
hot
summer
days
it
is
ridiculous
how
tasty
this
is
golden
orange
with
a
big
puffy
wit
head12
inch
of

stays
through
the
whole

thick
and
supple

throughout

are
citrus
dominated
and
quite
souralmost
lambicish
and
fade
back
and
forth
from
lemon
and
tart
orange
delicious
to
taste
with
sourball
orange
and
lemon
flavors
and
some
grapefruit
zest
hard
to
put
down
as
the
flavors
are
so
refreshing
medium
bodied
with
just
right
carbonation
providing
a
rush
of
creamy
foam
moments
after
each
sip
a
citrus
delightdamn
near
a
lambic
and
solid
as
a
rock
ill
be
going
back
to
this
one
real
soon
pours
with
a
very
hazy
golden
color
and
a
small
semisticky
head
aroma
is
of
hops
and
spices
clove
and
maybe
some
coriander
with
some
citric
notes
very
slight
hint
of
malt
is
also
noticeable
yeast
settles
quickly
to
the
bottom
making
it
necessary
to
frequently
swirl
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
a
bit
fluffy
from
carbonation
the
start
is
somewhat
smooth
but
then
a
tart
almost
sour
nature
takes
over
very
tart
citric
dry
finish
that
lingers
for
a
bit
lemon
notes
are
quite
prevalent
the
spiciness
is
mild
with
hints
of
clove
as
well
as
a
small
amount
of
yeast
the
malt
in
this
brew
is
very
subdued
with
almost
no
sweetness
but
there
is
a
soft
graininess
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
that
is
probably
a
good
summer
refresher
the
tart
and
sour
character
of
this
beer
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
though
this
is
the
first
belgian
pale
ale
single
that
ive
had
it
seems
to
me
to
be
more
of
a
witbier
to
sweet
for
my
taste
but
a
credit
to
its
style
overall
impression
a
nice
abbey
single
far
superior
to
some
of
the
ones
ive
tried
from
actual
trappist
breweries
and
probably
one
of
my
favorites
not
watery
tasting
at
all
somehow
it
is
similar
to
an
orval
without
the
bacterialwildyeast
element
very
tasty
pours
a
lightly
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
that
is
sturdy
and
lasting
lacing
nicely
aroma
is
yeasty
apple
peach
slightly
spicy
and
some

flavor
is
apple
some
sourness
lemon
zest
tart
acidic
and
quite
dry
medium
body
fairly
bubbly
carbonation
yet
another
beer
which
is
miscategorized
this
is
actually
a
wit
beer
the
name
abbey
single
probably
gets
it
placed
under
begian
pale
ales
wonderful
aroma
in
this
very
citrusy
with
some
other
hints
of
spice
this
spice
hint
in
the
aroma
is
quite
intriguing
since
it
is
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
supposedly
the
coriander
aroma
disipates
after
a
month
or
so
in
the
bottle
i
doubt
that
it
is
within
a
month
fresh
since
i
bought
in
the
states
nonetheless
the
taste
is
quite
extraordinary
it
zaps
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
a
cidery
sour
bite
and
finishes
sparkling
dry
which
i
found
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
few
hours
drive
from
the
masondixon
line
do
i
detect
a
hint
of
ginger
in
there
so
easy
to
drink
great
with
food
remember
it
was
made
to
be
drinkable
as
it
was
monks
everyday
beer
this
would
be
my
everyday
beer
this
is
just
a
damn
good
beer
and
interesting
to
boot
despite
its
single
status
its
got
a
good
abv
which
is
discernable
every
so
slightly
in
the
zesty
spicy
peppery
nose
muted
cloudy
yellow
cream
color
with
a
pure
white
head
starts
with
some
apple
flavors
and
progresses
through
a
lemon
zest
tartness
into
a
fairly
dry
finish
the
flavors
in
this
pretty
wellcarbonated
brew
are
strong
which
makes
it
more
interesting
a
slightly
tart
apple
flavor
mingling
with
the
citrus
and
the
aromas
leads
for
a
really
cool
sensation
its
a
fun
one
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
hops
cirtrus
banana
and
cloves
a
flavor
of
hops
sour
apples
and
some
citrus
the
finish
was
a
bit
on
the
tart
side
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavor
threw
me
off
a
bit
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
and
some
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
and
filled
with
citrus
hints
the
taste
is
very
smooth
for
having
such
a
strong
aroma
the
spices
also
come
out
in
the
taste
not
a
bad
beer
but
very
spicy
much
more
subdued
in
the
mouth
but
still
substantial
the
malt
and
yeastiness
dominate
but
the
spice
and
citrus
add
complexity

with
sharp

some

throughout

the

dryness
some

then
more
dry

overall
not
too
bad
and
worth
a
try
for
the
exploring
palate
it
looks
like
a
lambic
or
geuze
but
is
a
bit
darker
with
slightly
more
foam
on
it
the
taste
and
smell
are
also
like
a
lambic
or
geuze
but
the
sourness
is
somewhat
milder
probably
caused
by
the
blending
with
a
flemish
old
brown
beer
i
was
not
a
fan
of
sour
beer
in
the
beginning
but
this
beer
has
me
started
to
appreciate
the
sourness
cheers
flavours
focus
on
a
delicious
tartness
a
little
oak
light
elderflower
and
lemon
rind
stunning
the
tasteis
very
tart
like
a
juicy
grapefruit
mixed
with
malt
and
carbonated
with
zesty
lightly
hoppy
flavor
and
dry
woody
character
with
some
mild
tannin
and
gentle
flavor
from
the
barrel
the
taste
is
slightly
sharp
with
mild
toasted
flavor
which
i
suspect
is
part
of
the
blend
with
finish
acidic
almost
like
biting
into
a
grapefruit
rind
overall
very
goodnothing
bad
about
this
but
a
bit
raw
and
bitter
fresh
perhaps
a
little
aging
may
help
some
of
the
sour
flavors
conflict
for
me
but
very
decent
overall
it
hits
all
the
right
spots
perfectly
but
doesnt
really
wow
still
very
very
good
o
a
very
well
executed
twist
on
the
lambic
style
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
visit
cantillon
during
my
trip
to
belgium
and
personally
i
prefer
this
beer
over
any
of
theirs
as
this
one
has
a
bit
more
intensity
and
a
much
fuller
carbonation
really
wish
this
was
easier
to
find
in
the
states
id
gladly
keep
a
bottle
or
two
handy
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
excellent
drinkability
one
of
the
best
sour
belgian
ales
ive
ever
had
extremely
balanced
and
smooth

o
the
lack
of
tartness
is
refreshing
at
first
but
then
you
start
to
miss
that
tart
punch
this
is
a
blend
of
aged
geuze
and
fresh
belgian
blond
ale
i
need
to
remember
that
but
a
very
refreshing
tasty
beer
not
quite
worth
the
price
though
overall
very
good
the
sour
and
funk
adds
a
nice
twist
to
the
belgian
pale

isnt

the

is

year
was
very
nice
not
sure
if
id
let
it
ride
for
anything
more
than
1
additional
year
a
decently
balanced
sour
belgian
ale
the
blended
fruity
lambic
adding
an
extra
oomph
factor
without
going
all
over
the
top
weirdly
drinkable
especially
when
your
taste
buds
have
gotten
all
pent
up
in
anticipation
which
i
suppose
is
a
good
thing
here
now
on
the
flip
side
the
abv
has
been
upped
yet
the
inherent
tartness
is
just
capable
enough
at
hiding
it
huh
its
always
something
with
these
low
country
offerings
overall
very
tasty
beer
and
one
that
took
me
by
surprise
as
being
one
of
my
favorites
at
our
tasting
pours
turbid
amber
with
etched
whites
atop
with
a
solid
rim
of
the
same
fluffed
bubble
nice
apple
copper
acetic
vinegar
hints
of
lemon
and
funky
hay
and
soil
nicely
tart
up
front
and
with
a
bitterness
id
not
anticipated
and
some
metallic
and
astringent
character
some
leafy
vinous
character
along
some
unrefined
vinegar
thin
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
watering
finish
an
okay
beer
at
an
okay
price
17750ml
actually
a
very
sessionable
approachable
beer
with
a
sour
character
and
a
lambic
twist
i
would
enjoy
this
with
a
friend
at
lunch
time
over
a
couple
sanwiches
with
a
friend
on
a
nice
warm
spring
day
o
nice
geuze
vibe
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
in
my
opinion
but
rather
tasty
pretty
surprised
to
see
that
this
is
classified
as
a
bpa
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
finish
is
dry
sour
and
earthy
but
not
overly
so
of
either
overall
the
taste
profile
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
mind
the
sour
be
turned
up
a
notch
or
two
i
realize
this
is
labeled
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
it
has
some
gueuzelike
characteristics
to
it
an
interesting
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
overall
i
have
been
eyeing
this
bad
bot
for
a
while
and
happy
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
enjoy
it
might
have
to
have
some
more
of
this
stinky
beer
in
maine
next
weekend
o
very
drinkable
not
overly
sour
tart
and
funky
on
the
palate
a
pleasure
to
drink
ages
well
overall
just
incredible
and
real
easy
drinking
with
such
a
fruit
bowl
quality
i
am
at
a
loss
for
words
this
is
a
beer
to
just
dive
in
and
get
happily
lost
bottle
wrapper
says
best

pours
a
mildly
hazy
glowing
golden
burnt
orange
if
there
is
such
a
color
with
a
white
head
that
holds
for
a
bit
and
leaves
a

is

nectarine

and
just
a
touch
of
paleish

poking
its

through

wonderful
displaying
all
kinds
of
scents
that
turn
my
gears
taste
is
expressed
in
sweettart
fashion
with
tart
winning
a
bit
in
this
case
flavors
of
peaches
peach

citrus
earth

pineapple

nectarines
and
funk
wonderful
unique
and
familiar
at
the
same
time
medium
body
some
sweetness
but
finishes
fairly
dry
i
am
usually
impressed
by
de
ranke
extra
impressed
here
i
really
like
this
one
o
wish
this
beer
had
been
properly
classified
as
a
sour
and
not
as
a
bpa
so
i
wouldnt
have
wasted
15
on
a
drainpour
be
forewarned
if
you
dont
like
sours
o
a
solid
sour
nice
funk
definitely
will
pick
up
again
seems
to
be
like
a
cross
between
a
nice
gueuze
and
orval
very
easy
to
drink
hazy
orange
pour
with
a
surprisingly
present
offwhite
head
tart
fruit
nose
some
grapefruit
lemon
and
sour
cherry
good
bit
of
wood
and
some
barnyard
funkiness
overall
there
was
something
too
sweettart
about
this
simply
because
there
were
not
more
complex
flavors
underneath
felt
like
i
wanted
more
depth
in
the
flavor
but
ultimately
it
was
thin
as
was
the
palate
decent
but
admittedly
a
bit
of
letdown
given
my
high
hopes
a
terrific
beer
but
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
ranked
among
the
absolute
best
though
id
certainly
never
turn
it
down
o
i
see
this
is
already
rated
pretty
highly
but
why
dont
people
talk
about
it
more
deliciously
tart
and
sweet
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
surprise
the
palate
and
keep
things
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
ill
be
going
back
to
again
and
again
the
flavor
is
also
subdued
but
again
is
really
tasty
certainly
acidic
with
big
notes
of
lemon
and
some
lime
coming
through
there
is
a
touch
of
vinegar
before
giving
way
to
a
lingering
brett
funk
finishes
dry
light
mouthfeel
with
prickly
carbonation
o
great
aroma
i
was
definitely
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
pleasant
excellent
brett
definitely
a
worthwhile
beer
o
freakin
fantastic
25

overall
a
nice
deceptively
strong
sour
beer
from
belgium
whats
not
to
like
notes
tasty
but
not
as
amazing
as
people
have
told
me
it
is
o
being
so
heavily
one
or
two
sided
i
feel
that
perhaps
this
beer
is
young
i
think
given
time
it
could
develop
into
something
special
i
really
liked
it
refreshing
and
different
a
new
favourite
of
mine
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
a
refreshing
one
despite
the
higher
abv
some
beers
have
the
perfect
description
to
pull
you
in
this
is
one
of
them
it
poured
a
very
nice
orange
in
color
with
moderate
turbidity
and
a
half
finger
off
white
head
it
almost
smells
like
a
gueuze
yet
also
has
a
light
sweetness
to
it
all
i
can
really
get
from
it
is
peaches
apricots
and
fruit
juice
its
very
appealing
on
the
nose
the
flavors
are
surprisingly
very
sour
and
tart
i
expected
it
to
be
sour
just
not
this
much
its
very
impressive
it
is
straight
fermented
sour
peaches
and
apricots
it
has
a
dry
and
almost
bitter
finish
which
is
the
only
detractor
but
it
drinks
really
well
to
me
this
drinks
like
a
medium
bodied
gueuze
with
more
carbonation
than
average
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
sublimly
light
and
clean
sessionable
ale
7
210
the
kriek
de
ranke
is
great
so
it
came
as
no
surprise
that
this
one
was
quite
good
too
a
great
blend
of
beers
that
is
somewhere
between
a
gueuze
and
a
belgian
pale
ale
i
think
this
cost
me
9
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
and
i
would
call
that
a
deal
poored
a
rich
light
amber
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
tart
and
of
sour
apple
and
had
slightly
floral
notes
excellent
level
of
carbonation
for
the
style
flavor
was
awesome
very
smooth
sourness
with
a
hint
of
oak
could
have
had
the
whole
750ml
myself
but
that
would
be
selfish
wish
i
had
more
pour
is
clear
at
first
and
cloud
towards
the
end
golden
orange
nose
is
sour
funk
and
apple
cider
vinegar
and
the
smell
of
tarnish
wood
and
ash
a
hint
of
grassiness
but
more
so
like
the
minerals
of
flowers
without
the
perfume
palate
cuts
into
anything
like
a
knife
with
the
lack
of
any
trace
of
carbohydrates
or
sugars
herbal
hints
of
bark
and
rosemary
very
sour
and
feels
like
hypotonic
solution
that
absorbs
everything
into
itself
but
at
the
same
time
leaves
a
delicate
finish
of
pollen
honeysuckle
bitterness
and
a
wet
saddle
leathery
note
lighter
body
with
refreshing
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
acidity
adds
a
refreshing
factor
amazing
on
cask
at
moeder
lambic
drinks
like
something
between
a
straight
flat
lambic
which
it
is
not
and
a
fully
effervescent
mature
gueze
which
it
also
is
not
a
lovely
beer
on
a
hot
humid
spring
night
as
it
warms
up
you
can
really
taste
the
grain
complexity
which
is
rare
in
any
spontanteously
fermented
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
thing
of
beauty
i
would
not
be
surprised
however
if
in
a
bottle
this
beer
metamorphosed
into
something
either
better
or
worse
time
will
tell
for
now
drink
up
if
you
can
find
it
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
will
definitely
seek
it
out
while
im
early
in
my
exploration
of
sour
beers
i
can
already
tell
that
im
going
to
like
much
of
what
i
find
and
this
was
a
perfect
introduction
when
lunch
was
served
it
also
went
quite
nicely
with
the
salad
greens
and
quiche
id
chosen
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
and
truly
a
reflection
of
the
art
of
the
blender
as
well
as
the
brewer
who
may
in
fact
be
one
and
the
same
person
o
i
was
a
little
worried
at
first
but
this
one
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
as
i
worked
my
way
through
it
a
fine
brew
but
probably
not
one
i
could
have
on
a
regular
basis
smooth
and
creamy
body
from
the
cask
this
was
heaven
really
a
wonderful
beer
that
id
love
to
get
again
in
this
form
ill
pick
up
more
bottles
at
home
some
time
but
really
the
cask
version
is
best
overall
a
killer
sour
ale
ive
just
started
getting
into
sours
and
will
certainly
be
seeking
out
more
from
de
ranke
exceptional
ale
lip
puckering
sournesssimilar
to
sucking
a
lemon
the
beginning
has
pale
malt
dryness
the
full
body
is
matched
with
a
higher
than
expected
level
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
a
continuation
of
the
tartness
i
detect
no
hop
d
a
fantastic
beer
from
de
ranke
their
best
in
my
opinion
the
lambic
is
a
great
addition
just
a
beautiful
tasty
beer
d
doesnt
get
more
drinkable
than
this
for
a
sour
im
shocked
theres
not
more
talk
of
this
brew
on
this
site
this
is
such
an
innovative
and
tasty
brew
thats
definitely
worth
seeking
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
quite
refreshing
overall
definitely
something
id
pursue
in
the
future
medium
bodied
with
a
great
balance
of
sweet
estery
light
fruit
and
tart
puckering
sourness
funky
with
lots
of
musty
oak
and
vinegar
flavor
as
well
as
some
slight
lacto
midpalate
but
this
is
balanced
out
by
vinous
sweet
fruit
notes
especially
apple
grape
and
pear
the
combination
of
sweet
fruit
notes
and
vinegary
sourtartness
results
in
a
sweet
mouth
puckering
tart
finish
that
isnt
abrasive
or
acidic

overall
i
was
extremely
surprised
by
this
beer
in
a
pleasant
way
give
it
a
shot
i
must
have
passed
this
beer
a
dozen
times
or
more
without
buying
wow
what
a
mistake
the
feel
has
a
champagnelike
quality
to
the
finish
the
bubbles
scrub
my
palate
and
tickle
their
way
to
the
finish
the
finish
is
mostly
crisp
but
something
reminds
me
of
gingerale
very
nice
beer
this
was
easy
to
drink
all
3
of
us
liked
it
and
would
happily
buy
it
again
d
a
good
sour
very
accessible
and
an
easy
drinking
one
that
would
be
a
good
starting
point
for
someone
first
getting
into
the
style
this
would
also
be
a
great
sour
to
have
with
food
however
there
is
nothing
about
this
that
makes
me
think
of
a
belgain
pale
ale
when
what
i
see
in
front
of
me
is
a
nice
lightbodied
lambic
or
gueuze
dvery
nicely
done
an
approachable
and
wildly
drinkable
lambic
plenty
of
flavour
and
tartness
without
going
overboard
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
introduce
those
unfamiliar
with
the
style
to
beer
is
light
in
body
and
effervescent
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
bright
sourness
in
the
midpalate
and
a
mild
ever
so
mild
sweetness
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
the
overall
shape
of
the
beer
on
the
palate
is
nice
the
funkiness
is
underplayed
but
complements
that
lactic
sour
late
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
clean
and
moderately
dry
but
the
beer
does
not
dry
out
the
mouth
i
could
drink
a
gallon
of
it
i
love
this
beer
taste
is
quite
exquisite
with
really
nice
earthy
notes
and
funk
plus
peach
apricot
and
some
lightlytart
berries
maybe
some
cloudberry
presence
feel
is
slightly
puckering
and
creates
a
really
nice
finish
alongside
some
dry
funk
really
really
drinkable
what
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
ill
surely
be
looking
to
find
more
of
this
in
the
future
thanks
nic
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
a
beer
i
never
would
have
tried
on
my
own
nor
will
again
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
on
the
nose
this
one
is
very
acidic
sour
and
barnyardy
thin
on
the
palate
acidic
vinegar
the
sourness
comes
quick
and
then
fades
just
as
fast
it
would
go
great
with
a
meal
d
great
session
sour
i
will
not
have
any
trouble
finishing
off
the
bottle
perfect
for
a
warm
sunny
day
would
be
a
great
pick
to
introduce
someone
to
sours
d
d
i
really
liked
the
smell
of
this
beer
the
taste
was
good
but
a
step
down
would
definitely
try
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
large
white
head
once
popping
the
cap
off
this
guy
i
got
huge
aromas
of
sour
funk
love
it
great
sour
notes
with
apples
and
wood
i
also
get
very
subtle
floral
scents
as
well
the
taste
is
delicious
initially
i
get
a
lot
of
tart
green
apple
flavor
followed
by
some
funky
belgian
yeast
flavors
with
even
more
delicious
mouth
puckering
tastiness
i
get
a
strong
taste
of
wood
from
the
barrels
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
i
know
theres
some
other
fruit
tastes
im
not
picking
up
that
i
should
be
but
my
palate
is
still
trying
to
get
these
sour
ales
down
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
bubbly
but
not
too
bubbly
very
full
bodied
and
wellbalanced
drinkability
is
high
great
beer
d
the
drinkability
is
silly
too
easy
and
if
i
had
another
bottle
i
would
be
pouring
one
now
overall
i
had
this
backtoback
with
cuvee
de
tomme
and
the
flavor
profile
on
this
was
smaller
in
both
depth
and
width
still
an
easydrinking
beer
for
the
style
with
a
decent
amount
going
on
bottle
best
before
04
2013
so
a
little
early
on
this
one
pours
a
slightly
opaque
golden
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
withe
had
that
slowly
recedes
the
aroma
is
grapes
with
notes
of
sour
if
you
can
smell
sour
o
with
the
addition
of
lemon
the
taste
is
sour
and
tart
with
the
funk
sourness
and
lemon
zest
abound
pretty
puckeringly
sour
lightmedium
mouthfeel
a
very
good
sour
beer
the
paper
wrapping
has
to
add
to
the
taste
right
d
i
had
no
problem
having
two
glasses
of
this
it
drinks
very
easily
nothing
lingers
on
the
palate
its
just
a
total
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
the
palate
opens
sour
with
a
lemony
tartness
with
some
a
bright
lemon
and
citrus
peel
sourness
along
with
a
moderate
melon
character
great
depth
and
balance
on
the
palate
theres
a
mild
sweetness
present
but
it
is
more
fruity
than
plain
sugarlike
theres
a
splash
of
vinegar
as
well
just
enough
to
keep
the
palate
bright
without
being
overbearing
the
bulk
of
the
sourness
is
lemony
though
and
almost
whelms
the
funk
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
lemon
peel
sourness
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
this
beer
is
a
hidden
gem
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
palate
is
a
little
slicker
than
id
like
but
otherwise
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
at
the
price
point
its
hard
to
beat
really
i
will
be
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
a
nice
hazy
goldenorangery
color
with
a
great
sour
nose
of
citrus
lemon
funk
the
taste
is
filled
with
lemontartfunk
blended
with
a
nice
golden
ale
and
some
oak
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
the
sour
hangs
around
a
little
as
to
say
hey
i
was
just
here
a
moment
ago
i
left
something
to
entertain
the
next
sip
i
just
want
to
keep
on
drinking
this
cellar
temp
beer
in
this
hot
humid
new
england
weather
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
gueuze
than
a
belgian
paleale
i
really
would
love
to
see
what
the
bugs
due
to
the
golden
ale
over
the
next
few
years
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
lemons
with
some
oak
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
tart
lemons
mixed
with
oak
some
vanilla
and
belgian
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
sour
beer
that
i
hope
to
try
again

certainly
hit
a
home
run
with
cuvée
de
ranke
its
my
understanding
that
this
is
the
base
beer
for
kriek
de
ranke
no
wonder
its
so
tasty
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
here
eh
maybe
the
nose
could
use
a
little
more
strength
perhaps
a
little
more
body
too
but
im
good
with
this
as
it
is
not
too
tart
not
too
funky
just
right
highly
recommended
reviewed
from
my
notes
a
chilled
bottle
was
split
four
ways
between
tulip
glasses
with
the
de
ranke
logo
the
beer
is
opaque
with
a
creamsicleorange
color
there
is
a
thin
splotchy
foam
head
the
bubbles
are
white
and
soaplike
the
nose
lets
you
know
this
is
a
sour
beer
theres
apricot
and
brett
or
something
that
smells
like
a
beer
brewed
with
it
in
there
i
like
the
aroma
a
lot
the
flavor
is
a
good
mixture
of
puckering
sour
and
mildly
sweet
fruit
i
can
taste
apricot
and
peach
it
has
a
great
musty
and
dry
finish
it
is
ever
so
slightly
chalky
tasting
mainly
in
the
finish
this
is
a
very
good
sour
beer
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
very
low
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
coating
of
the
mouth
that
tastes
both
sweet
and
sour
the
first
thing
i
jotted
down
about
the
cuvee
de
rankes
drinkability
is
oh
so
drinkable
and
i
stand
by
that
simple
assessment
obviously
it
will
turn
off
anyone
not
prepared
for
a
sour
beer
as
said
before
its
nice
to
get
a
sour
sometimes
that
isnt
over
the
top

drinkable
i
have
minimal

with
sours
so
this
is
really
a
great
intro
to
them
but
it
has
a
refined
quality
to
it
perhaps
it
is
the
lack
of
overt

that
many
of

dont

i
could

a

just
about
as
average
as
you
can
get
with
a
beer
o
excellent
and
so
drinkable
verdict
the
younger
the
beer
the
more
vibrant
the
fruit
flavors
are
and
the
head
lasts
longer
the
younger
the
beer
is
even
at
2
years
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
better
fresh
batch
012
appears
cloudy
golden
with
aromas
of
yeast
and
floral
notes
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
not
too
much
on
the
palate
other
than
the
expected
taste
of
yeast
and
a
trace
of
lemon
and
a
mild
bitterness
very
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
the
finish
is
dry
but
the
yeasty
flavor
sits
for
a
long
time
very
refreshing
i
could
easily
drink
multiple
bottles
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
average
belgian
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
beer
it
didnt
blow
my
hair
back
and
maybe
because
of
the
hype
surrounding
the
brewery
this
review
isnt
the
most
impartial
i
think
i
did
a
good
job
though
however
for
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
this
beer
there
are
a
dozen
others
that
are
just
as
good
condor
recommended
condor
approved
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
belgian
blonde
it
manages
to
keep
the
trademarks
of
the
style
yeast
lemons
cloves
etc
while
tweaking
them
slightly
to
make
it
a
bit
more
interesting
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
much
less
cloying
and
sweet
than
other
belgian
styles
drier
and
crisper
wellmade
pours
a
hazy
straw
with
a
small
quickly
fading
white
head
lacing
was
excellent
smells
of
lemon
clove
and
banana
with
hints
of
light
sourness
and
yeast
grassy
earthy
hops
with

of

and
sourness
medium
light
bodied
with
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
supremely
drinkable
sour
pale
o
excellent
refreshing
o
weird
smell
yet
fantastic
taste
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
alone
are
worth
searching
this
one
out
m
while
this
is
my
first
time
having
a
single
i
see
the
appeal
as
its
got
pleasant
flavors
while
being
very
easy
to
drink
ideal
for
lunches
and
mowing
lawns
o
delightful
blonde
ale
o
far
from
their
best
beer
but
still
delicious
just
about
sums
it
up
o
its
right
up
there
with
the
best
examples
of
this
style
with
that
distinct
belgian
yeast
character
of
moderate
spice
and
fruit
that
dominates
this
beer
overall
a
really
solid
belgian
especially
for
the
price
o
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
from
this
beer
but
it
delivered
great
complexity
without
weight
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
drinking
a
gently
bretted
saison
but
with
a
belgian
twist
overall
exactly
what
id
want
during
the
warm
springfall
months
here
in
florida
its
incredibly
light
smooth
refreshing
and
tasty
o
overall
simply
a
pure
joy
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
easy
an
ideal
beverage
for
summertime
o
strong
beer
for
sure
would
have
preferred
to
have
had
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
is
still
fantastic
now
another
beer
well
done
rr
the
taste
lacked
depth
and
complexity
but
it
was
still
an
enjoyable
drink
verdict
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
from
russian
river
but
a
far
cry
from
a
beer
like
damnation
or
some
of
their
other
belgian
blondes
the
beer
is
just
too
simplistic
and
grain
heavy
and
it
doesnt
come
across
as
light
and
delicate
which
is
what
i
was
really
hoping
for
overall
an
excellent
ale
and
one
that
i
would
drink
more
often
if
i
could
overall
just
a
really
good
easy
drinking
blonde
from
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
overall
its
easy
for
me
to
say
this
is
my
least
favorite
offering
of
russian
rivers
that
ive
had
so
far
seems
like
their
wheelhouse
is
sour
ales
and
types
of
ipa
both
of
which
i
love
reminds
me
of
damnation
in
some
ways
which
i
suppose
makes
sense
but
whatever
they
do
to
increase
the
abv
of
damnation
also
imparts
a
bit
more
interesting
components
to
the
beer
as
i
liked
it
better
than
this
one
there
are
several
bpas
that
i
would
drink
before
expending
the
effort
to
procure
another
bottle
of
this
overall
brett
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
is
a
really
great
compliment
i
dig
it
alot
as
always
russian
river
makes
another
outstanding
beer
overall
nothing
remarkable
here
but
its
solid
good
belgian
pale
you
could
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
hurry
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
very
enjoyable
session
able
beer
o
a
solid
and
wellcrafted
bpa
but
nothing
more
a
good
but
unremarkable
bpa
a
solid
introduction
to
the
style
at
hand
although
at
this
point
ive
become
so
entrenched
with
the
hoppier
wilder
pale
ale
offerings
from
belgium
to
the
point
where
this
makes
me
nothing
more
than
nostalgic
to
the
time
period
that
i
was
first
discovering
this
style
absolutely
recommended
for
people
wanting
to
get
into
startup
offerings
in
the
style
and
very
tame
overall
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
the
brett
version
back
in
the
day
though

never
been
a
big
fan
of
most
belgian
styles
but
i
think
russian
river
knows
what
its
doing
with
this
style
really
a
light
bodied
beer
and
soft
but
not
too
gentle
remains
smooth
and
maintains
a
nice
dry
finish
extremely
drinkable
beer
goes
quick
especially
on
a
humid
day
like
today
a
very
nice
beer
of
a
style
i
dont
normally
appreciate
as
much
as
i
should
but
am
occasionally
craving
a
well
done
beer
crisp
refreshing
and
super
flavorful
the
orange

styrian
goldings
really
meld
effortlessly
with
the
fruit
forward
and
spicy
belgian
yeast
these
flavors
coupled
with
the
lively
carbonation
lend
the
beer
a
very
thirst
quenching
character
belgian
single
ales
arent
too
common
to
find
but
this
is
one
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
a
very
tasty
easydrinking
blonde
ale
i
cant
believe
ive
never
tried
this
guy
considering
i
see
it
all
over
but
will
definitely
have
it
again

4
for
a
12
oz
bottle
in
seattle
if
i
could
drink
this
every
day
i
would
many
subtle
flavors
come
together
to
create
a
delicious
and
complex
beer
that
is
also
refreshing
nicely
crafted
and
a
benchmark
for
belgian
pale
ales
in
my
book
oa
very
enjoyable
belgian
blonde
ale
love
the
aroma
of
the

and
the

it

wish
rr
would
start
supplying
more
of
their
beer
to
pa
overall
this
was
my
second
nonipa
offering
from
russian
river
its
a
very
enjoyable
rendition
of
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
at
least
if
im
right
in
thinking
this
is
a
bpa
looks
great
tastes
great
and
it
is
definitely
an
aboveaverage
example
of
the
style
4
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
when
done
this
well
it
is
delicious
o
a
very
good
belgian
style
blonde
nice
flavors
with
good
complexity
and
no
off
putting
qualities
o
disappointed
in
this
would
not
buy
again
o
this
is
a
great
representation
of
what
is
an
oftenoverlooked
style
low
in
alcohol
complex
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
the
perfect
lunchtime
beer
and
can
easily
be
paired
with
tons
of
different
foods
without
dominating
the
meal
now
if
only
it
was
a
little
less
expensive
o
good
belgian
pale
ale
overall
very
drinkable
pretty
tasty
and
not
overly
spiced
or
too
yeasty
its
nearly
9
per
375ml
bottle
here
in
philly
so
ill
forget
about
having
it
again
o
this
is
a
far
more
approachable
sour
or
funky
beer
than
many
others
easily
appeals
to
people
that
are
just
starting
to
explore
those
stylescharacteristics
the
overall
sournesstartness
is
light
but
this
is
still
quite
tasty
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
even
though
it
is
quite
low
in
abv
definitely
another
quality
beer
from
russian
river
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
the
subtle
sourness
from
the
brett
lend
some
complexity
to
the
beer
this
would
be
a
good
choice
for
someone
that
is
just
getting
into
sours
overallcomments
this
is
only
my
second
russian
river
beer
and
first
out
of
a
bottle
i
was
very
impressed
very
good
beer
from
start
to

highly
recommend
classified

a

pale

at

o
the
thing
about
this
style
is
that
its
never
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
for
me
i
do
think
however
this
is
as
good
as
a
belgian
blonde
ale
is
going
to
get
for
me
before
venturing
too
far
into
either
the
ipa
or
the
sour
side
of
things
the
balance
in
this
brew
is
amazing
with
little
hints
of
everything
interesting
stuff
highly
recommended
pretty
good
belgianstyle
blonde
or

not

style
i
normally
seek
out
but
someone
generously
gave
me
this
bottle
and
ill
never
turn
down
a
chance
to
try
a
russian
river
brew
pale
golden
beer

with
a

that

rarely

o

simple

but
not
much
going
on
oone
major
problem
its
the
price
well
i
got
this
in
western
pa
so
im
pretty
sure
i
overpaid
the
truth
is
i
dream
about
a
pale
belgian
ale
with
this
much
flavor
kept
at
a
very
drinkable
abv
i
just
wish
it
wouldnt
wreck
my
wallet
to
get
a
case
of
this
it
definitely
doesnt
have
the
flavor
of
the
stronger
pale
belgians
but
it
still
has
an
awesome
rawness
the
label
stated
that
this
was
a
sister
beer
to
damnation
and
id
guess
it
is
the
weak
sister
far
more
subtle
and
smooth
this
blonde
ale
was
not
nearly
as
complex
as
damnation
but
was
nice
enough
it
poured
with
a
very
thin
head
and
was
very
notably
blonde
the
aroma
was
lighter
in

notes
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
pears
the
taste
was
smooth

much
softer
than
damnation
overall
its
enjoyable
but
not
quite
its

o
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
but
wasnt
overly
impressed
i
definitely
enjoyed
damnation
the
base
beer
more
and
there
are
plenty
of
beers
from
rr
that
i
would
choose
over
this
i
would
drink
this
again
but
definitely
not
pay
the
price
tag
on
it
or
seek
it
out
o
definitely
dryer
than
i
was
expecting
leaving
it
a
bit
flat
flavorwise
pretty
refreshing
though
oi
liked
this
beer
for
its
balance
and
drinkability
almost
a
session
beer
but
for
6
bucks
i
felt
like
it
was
just
a
bit
too
subtle
when
compared
against
some
of
its
belgian
pale
ale
competition
m
quenching
snappy
very
refreshing
beer
highly
drinkable
overall
i
know
i
should
grade
this
on
the
style
and
not
on
my
personal
preference
and
i
did
but
i
will
tell
you
here
in
the
after
notes
that
i
hate
everything
this
beer
and
brews
of
its
style
are
i
hate
the
smell
color
taste
popularity
i
find
it
so
hard
to
believe
that
so
many
bas
seek
out
this
style
of
beer
it
goes
down
soooo
smooth
and
easy
if
it
were
on
draft
id
order
about
10234253
upfront
redemption
is
a
tad
tart
and
brings
on
lemon
grain
and
bread
like
no
other
the
finish
actually
does
remind
me
of
a
sourdough
loaf
very
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
albiet
almost
sessionable
it
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
with
a
sharp
medium
body
satisfying
me
right
now
this
pours
a
cloudy
straw
white
color
i
get
a
delicate
aroma
with
hints
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
full
of
yeasty
esters
it
is
a
delicate
and
light
drinker
with
a
slight
musty
estery
finish
along
with
the
coriander
and
orange
notes
pleasant
o
an
exemplar
of
the
style
highly
recommended
will
be
drinking
again
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
smooth
and
creamy
beer
very
pleasant
o
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
its
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
bpa
another
solid
offering
from
russian
river
o
refreshing
and
not
overdone
a
really
solid
bpa
and
a
good
drinker
o
a
solid
bpa
overall
the
watery
body
holds
it
back
a
bit
though
o
really
well
done
but
id
expect
nothing
less
from
one
of
cas
top
breweries
perfect
for
this
hot
summer
night
crisp
clean
tart
funky
grassy
grainy
and
fruity
excellent
d
a
really
nice
example
of
this
style
i
am
torn
on
my
ratings
on
one
hand
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
the
other
its
45
for
a
12oz
bottle
which
is
going
to
set
my
expectations
higher
it
doesnt
serve
its
purpose
very
well
at
that
price
point
i
have
to
be
honest
in
saying
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
at
first
but
the
further
i
get
into
it
the
more
i
get
and
appreciate
what
is
supposed
to
be
going
on
here
really
nice
beer
for
a
rare
style
although
for
the
price
point
id
rather
pick
up
a
damnation
99
of
the
time
still
though
a
solid
offering
cheers
overall
yes
its
good
its
light
truly
belgian
in
style
and
drinkable
but
its
not
that
complex
and
has
a
few
things
that
id
personally
change
overall
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
its
pedigree
promised
so
much
more
than
what
it
delivered
but
what
it
delivered
wasnt
bad
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
coming
in
from
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
was
absolutely
refreshing
and
the
beer
yelled
summer
from
the
top
of
its
foamy
little
lungs
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
depth
of
flavor
and
aroma
than
what
was
delivered
o
a
really
fantastic
summer
beer
it
would
be
so
nice
to
live
in
santa
rose
just
to
drink
beer
like
this
on
tap
every
chance
one
could
get
o
very
good
bpa
more
complex
than
most
but
very
drinkable
o
very
easy
drinking
blonde
glad
i
tried
this
but
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
a
bit
overpriced
for
what
you
get
in
my
opinion
but
another
quality
beer
by
rr
overall
very
nice
beer
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
but
its
a
bit
pricey
i
dont
drink
beer
just
to
get
a
buzz
but
a
little
alcohol
would
be
nice
for
the
price
overall
a
smooth
lightly
flavored
easy
drinking
brew
if
not
a
bit
to
its
own
detriment
probably
not
worth
the
asking
price
lest
one
is
at
the
brewery
andor
getting
it
on
tap
complex
and
tasty
bright
and
refreshing
definitely
a
well
crafted
example
of
the
style
and
worth
the
buy
for
sure
would
like
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
standby
for
those
hot
summer
days

that
i
will

o
a

from

highly

and
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
with

abv
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
all
in
all
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
expected
sourness
is
still
present
though
it
is
toned
down
just
a
bit
to
let
the
belgian
properties
shine
perfect
for
a
summer
night
the
beers
complexity
however
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
not
bad
an
average
belgian
ale
i
am
spoiled
though
i
just
got
done
living
in
europe
for
the
last
few
years
so
i
had
regular
access
to
belgians
beers
and
other
european
greats
anyway
this
is
my
least
liked

corked

and

strawpale

good
carbonation
very

on
taste
a
nice
hoopy
bitter
flavor
but
not
much
else
in
the
way
of
flavor
not
a
lot
of
depth
overall
a
very
average
beer
moderately
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
manages
to
feel
both
smooth
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
with
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
lowish

slightly
murky
orange
with
a

foamy

on

down
smell
is
of

and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
with
each
sip
that
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
pours
a
shiny
cloudy
golden

nice
yeasty
aroma
good
mouthfeel
citrus
and

in
the
taste
had
this
in
a
beer
session
with
some
higher
abv
so
this
was
a
welcome
laid
back
beer
nothing
too
fancy
about
it
but
its
well
balanced
and
refreshing
with
a
clean
finish
not
every
beer
has
to
be
extreme
and
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
rr
overall
i
freakin
love
this
one
it
might
be
my
favorite
pale
ale
belgian
or
american
style
its
just
the
perfect
blend
of
flavors
and
is
extremely
refreshing
overall
the
balance
is
wonderful
the
flavors
mesh
very
well
and
the
flavor
is
almost
light
d
very
drinkable
very
crisp
and
refreshing
good
balance
of
flavors
and
it
never
feels
empty
a
nice
light
colored
beer
with
a
dense
white
head
not
a
big
smell
but
a
veryeasy
to
drink
pale
ale
i
have
been
into
belgian
beers
lately
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
although
lower
in
alcohol
than
some
of
the
others
i
have
been
drinking
i
enjoyed
the
carbination
o
pear
and
apple
with
subtle
spicing
and
beautiful
belgian
yeast
notes
balanced
and
delicate
man
does
this
go
down
easy
this
is
a
perfect
belgian
pale
o
man
this
is
a
beer
that
i
drank
and
thought
to
myself
wow
this
is
actually
not
a
stellar
showing
from
rr
but
that
was
my
own
immaturity
after
drinking
another
sip
i
realized
that
this
is
a
belgian
pale
ale
not
an
american
wild
ale
not
a
dipa
this
is
supposed
to
be
reserved
delicate
and
beautiful
and
guess
what
it
is
bravo
to
a
brewery
that
frequently
pushes
the
envelope
to
use
some
restraint
and
craft
and
delicate
and
delicious
brew
subtle
elegant
and
clean
corked
and
caged
375ml
bottle
poured
a
light
straw
color
with
ample
white
suds
on
top
lighlty
grainy
fresh
sourdough
bread
accented
by
the
fruit
and
spice
of
belgian
yeast
mild
bitterness
and
a
fragrant
blend
of
flowers
and
herbs
on
the
nose
i
could
drink
this
everyday
save
for
the
price
this
is
something
different
from
russian
river
at
first
taste
i
declared
this
is
my
least
favorite
russian
river
beer
ive
ever
had
after
reading
the
label
and
hearing
it
described
as
a
belgian
single
huh
i
decided
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
pours
cloudy
and
very
light
straw
yellow
color
with
a
very
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
out
but
leaves
some
lacing
smells
like
wheat
malt
sorft
of
hefe
yeast
mixed
with
monks
yeast
and
some
light
herbs
corriander
flavor
is
very
light
wheat
malt
type
base
germanesque
for
a
second
before
relaxign
into
a
balanced
light
ale
with
tons
of
great
yeast
happening
feel
is
nice
more
than
nice
like
all
of
their
beers
its
bubbly
and
foaming
and
expansive
and
clean
i
love
the
feel
body
is
light
light
light
but
it
works
with
this
flavor
profile
again
this
aint
to
supplication
but
its
a
nice
drinkable
blonde
ale
od
i
enjoy
this
for
its
clean
feel
and
crispness
almost
seems
to
be
lacking
in
some
area
which
may
just
be
the
result
of
such
a
simple
refreshing
beer
very
different
than
anything
i
can
remember
would
have
again
thanks
stupac2
o
this
is
just
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
no
other
way
around
it
very
enjoyable
overall
very
drinkable
pale
ale
with
the
added
belgian
yeast
tinge
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
o
very
very
good
belgian
pale
ale
im
sad
that
i
only
bought
one
bottle
when
i
had
the
chance
oa
really
nice
well
put
together
beer
definitely
tastes
belgian
o
overall
excellent
beer
but
not
sure
its
my
favorite
style
o
crisp
pure
golden
pale
ale
with
fruit
and
spice
overall
definitely
a
solid
take
on
the
style
loads
of
mild
flavor
so
much
going
on
but
you
have
to
work
for
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
seem
like
it
needs
any
age
to
improve
easy
drinking
but
not
a
blockbuster
from
russian
river
overall
impression
a
very
nice
brew
from
russian
river
but
not
my
favorite
from
them
just
good
all
along
the
ranks
i
would
definitely
grab
a
sour
from
them
before
enjoying
this
one
again
very
close
to
style
thumbs
up

would
really
hit
the
spot
on
a

oa
delicious
blonde
ale
with
a
great
blend
of
flavors
and
balance
if
you
are
looking
for
an
excellent
summer
belgian
this
might
just
be
it
well
done
once
again
russian
river
d
highly
drinkable
and
high
quality
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
too
mild
for
me
though
o
this
is
perfection
as
far
as
blonde
ales
go
the
belgian
yeast
is
very
noticeable
and
you
keep
getting
hints
of
grass
and
citrus
like
a
witbier
perfect
for
the
summer
i
really
hope
to
get
more
of
this
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
never
becoming
coating
or
sticky
it
provides
for
a
very
easy
mouthfeel
but
does
seem
to
get
bullied
by
the
carbonation
prickly
fizzy
and
slightly
explosive
the
carbonation
fizzes
when
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
and
foams
up
when
the
beer
is
swallowed
this
with
the
lighter
body
can
make
it
a
little
difficult
to
really
dissect
the
flavors
of
the
beer
would
be
a
good
beer
for
the
warmer
months
if
i
didnt
know
id
guess
it
to
be
a
lager
and
not
an
ale
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
o
overall
a
very
solid
belgian
single
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
clean
lightly
toasted
bread
notes
up
front
mildly
sweet
powdered
sugar
fruit
fills
in
briefly
before
peppery
bitterness
and
faintly
citric
acidity
take
over
a
little
hay
and
yeast
into
the
dry
finish
moderate
body
with
a
lively
lilting
feel
refreshing
and
complex
i
like
that
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
at
9bottle
would
expect
something
a
little
more
remarkable
this
would
be
a
great
summer
session
brew
if
the
price
was
right
cheers
o
decent
bpa
pretty
simple
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
so
impressed
with
this
beer
the
flavor
is
so
unique
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
again

perhaps
a

felt

worked

still
a

dont

this

experience
i
wish
i
could
easily
get
rr
beers
living
in
kentucky
im
forced
to
acquire
them
via
trade
definitely
worth
the
effort
drinkability
and
overall
impression
with
the
westvleteren
blonde
having
sold
me
on
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
style
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
to
seeing
how
it
would
compare
to
my
10
month
old
memories
of
that
beer
i
was
not
disappointed
the
redemption
is
a
clean
crisp
easy
sipper
with
one
sip
following
another
easily
and
comfortably
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
would
show
well
in
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
the
westvleteren
blonde
and
that
ill
be
more
than
happy
to
be
finding
and
drinking
this
again

my

how
good
this

i
like
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
like
the
text
on

the

i
get
a

reminds

of
my

rr
does
it

d
not

not

i
would

again
certainly
my

russian

offering
to

o
overall
unassuming
nice
bpa
but
not
an
archetype
for
the
style

certainly
a
nonpolarizing
beer
seems
like
a
safe
take
on
the
style
since
it
is
so
soft
it
is
almost

for
but
it
delicately
tart
with
the
same
lemon
as
in
the
nose
not
real
yeasty
and
alcohol
is
not
present
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
i
will
say
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
this
beer
is
just
lacking
it
overall
i
didnt
even
finish
my
glass
and
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
i
thought
this
was
par
ok
maybe
this
is
what
they
wanted
to
brew
but
not
for
me
sdub
it
son
o
really
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
pricey
for
me
i
prefer
its
brother
beer
damnation
o
a
nice
beer
but
one
better
suited
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
than
a
winter
day
when
it
is
snowing
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
above
average
but
does
not
stand
out
onot
bad
im
not
a
huge
fan
on
blonde
ales
so
im
not
sure
what
to
be
looking
for
in
one
very
good
beer
this
redemption
is
light
and
easy
drinking
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
an
excellent
one
finger
white
head
outstanding
lacing
on
my
cbs
snifter
one
of
the
better
looking
beers
ive
seen
in
the
style
the
nose
is
definitely
funk
apple
pear
lemon
mustiness
simply
outstanding
this
could
totally
be
a
beer
from
belgium
and
thats
high
praise
the
taste
follows
suit
with
brett
lemon
malt
apple
pear
all
there
theres
a
slight
sourness
but
its
not
over
the
top
feel
is
a
lemon
tartness
with
an
nice
malt
backbone
very
full
for
the
style
with
only
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
wowed
me
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
through
drinking
belgian
beers
and
this
could
totally
fool
me
into
thinking
it
was
from
there
excellent
job
by
russian
river
once
again
this
beer
has
all
the
makings
of
being
world
class
cheers
o
a
nicely
flavored
and
refreshing
beer
there
is
nothing
in
the
flavor
profile
that
stands
out
but
it
is
well
balanced
i
smell
pear
and
i
taste
pear
and
has
the
dryness
that
comes
with
it
spices
and
funk
a
very
subdued
drink
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
despite
still
being
on
the
fence
with
this
style
o
very
easy
drinking
for
a
belgian
style
beer
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
that
low
in
abv
either
could
drink
this
one
all
day
and
see
it
pairing
well
with
food
too
o
not
as
good
as
other
offerings
i
have
had
from
rr
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
decide
whether
i
am
not
big
on
this
beer
or
if
it
is
just
that
i
am
not
into
the
style
i
keep
trying
to
like
bpas
but
cant
get
into
them
d
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
lack
of
complexity
keeps
my
interest
from
being
too
high
o
a
really
nice
representation
of
the
style
a
supremely
easy
drinker
one
that
i
could
definitely
have
a
lot
of
redemption
is
easily
the
best
belgian
single
ive
had
though
it
might
be
the
only
example
of
the
style
ive
tried
and
even
compared
with
belgian
pale
ales
it
rises
near
the
top
of
the
pack
it
might
not
be
the
most
flavorful
beer
ever
but
its
drinkability
is
outrageous
if
it
were
available
in
arizona
in
the
summer
id
buy
it
by
the
case
o
not
sure
what
rr
was
going
with
this
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
rings
of
lacing
very
fruity
aroma
more
so
citrus
than
yeast
with
pale
malt
banana
and
mild
floral
hops
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
citrus
and
ester
sweetness
over
a
light
malt
body
and
a
hint
of
floral
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
light
texture
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
my
favorite
of
the
regular
rotation
nonba
tion
beers
o
a
quality
rr
beer
for
sure
definitely
worth
a
try
while
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
its
sister
beer
damnation
i
find
it
inferior
to
some
of
russian
rivers
other
offerings
e
g
temptation
consecration
supplication
o
this
is
a
simple
and
tasty
beer
refreshing
but
not
too
interesting
i
dont
think
i
would
have
as
high
of
a
regard
for
it
if
the
packaging
was
simpler
o
overall
a
really
nice
beer
nice
mouthfeel
always
enjoy
every
beer
from
russian
river

o
overall
i
found
this
underwhelming
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
my
hands
on
5
rr
brews
on
my
west
coast
trip
this
is
the
4th
of
the
5
and
so
far
is
it
by
far
my
least
favorite
its
enjoyable
but
its
nothing
special
i
also
think
i
drank
this
too
warm
i
usually
prefer
my
beers
at
slightly
higher
temps
than
recommended
but
i
would
suggest
to
drink
this
one
quite
chilled
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
would
be
wonderful
if
billed
as
a
saison
but
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
was
still
rather
nice
lightly
toasted
and
unmalted
barley
comes
together
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
that
gives
off
some
ripe
apple
and
tart
blackberry
nuances
i
could
drink
this
all
day
smooth
and
somewhat
grassy
palate
this
beer
has
flavor
and
spunk
but
not
the
alcoholic
punch
of
most
belgian
style
beers
available
in
the
usa
vern
nice
beer
gonna
try
its
brother
damnation
next
to
compare
i
recommend
this
beer
to
all
who
love
simple
clean
refreshing
beers
that
feature
tasteful
belgian
yeast
tart
and
tangy
at
center
stage
o
4
overall
this
is
a
very
different
kind
of
beer
for
all
i
know
this
is
what
a
singel
tastes
like
its
quite
unlike
an
ordinary
belgian
pale
ale
interesting
yeast
notes
with
lightly
sweetened
light
fruits
and
a
clean
finish
overall
it
really
does
taste
like
a
hefe
and
the
flavours
are
very
fresh
and
vibrant
i
enjoyed
every
sip
and
i
could
honestly
drink
this
beer
every
day
it
would
work
especially
well
on
a
warm
summer
day
another
fantastic
beer
by
rr
overall
to
be
completely
honest
i
felt
a
little
underwhelmed
drinking
redemption
only
because
my
expectations
for
my
first
beer
from
russian
river
were
through
the
roof
i
do
however
understand
theyre
highly
revered
for
a
reason
and
perhaps
i
shouldve
chosen
another
one
of
their
offering
to
drink
first
dont
get
me
wrong
though
redemption
is
still
a
quality
brew
batch

once
again
these

guys
hit
the
ball
out

i
let
the

warm

out

then
poured
according
to
label
got
a
smallish
frothy
sudsy
off
white

that
soon
settled
to
a
thin
cover
and
a
bit
of

color
is
a
slightly
hazy

with
loads
of
large
bubble
trails
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
with
yeast
malt
citrus
apples
balsamic
vinegar
perfume
wet
grain
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
the
carbonic
tang
hitting
you
then
all
those
other
things
its
fairly
dry
body
n
carbonation
are
perfect
for

plus
it
also

pretty
solid

here
nice
depth
and
very
refreshing
taboot
usually
i
can
loose
interest
in
this
style
rather
easily
but
this
was
well
done
thankfully
i
have
another
bottle
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
wish
i
could
buy
more
bottles
of
it
locally
final
thought
price
is

low

but
all
in
all
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
if
i
made
a
lot
of
money
this
would
be
my
daily
summer
beer
d
great
sessionable
summer
time
beer
overall
a
refreshingly
light
beer
with
a
satisfying
complexity
if
this
beer
were
just
a
touch
heavier
i
think
i
would
love
it
all
the
more
still
this
beer
is
a
very
pleasant
quaff

for

lets
not

stand
out

less

slightly

good
beer
but
not
up

the

some
of
rrs
other
offerings
o
perhaps
the
only
balanced
blond
ale
i
have
had
not
too
sweet
or
spicy
but
not
watery
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
style
of
beer
i
have
a
theory
that
they
use
several
yeasts
to
produce
this
beer
unlike
a
lot
of
sweeter
blond
ales
which
tend
to
be
good
before
or
after
a
meal
but
not
during
this
would
go
nicely
hand
in
hand
with
many
foods
i
verified
this
by
heating
up
some

again
on
a

overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
the
style
isnt
at
the
top
of
my
list
and
if
i
ever
get
another
chance
to
get
some
beer
from
russian
river
there
are
several
others
that
i
would
go
for
first
d
amazing
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
russian
river
and
a
good
reminder
of
why
rr
is
considered
to
be
a
worldclass
brewery
and
they
totally
deserve
the
acclaim
this
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
stunner
is
it
no
prerelease
hype
clamoring
for
a
bpa
shame
with
a
beer
this
good
there
should
be
o
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
belgian
table
beer
one
that
i
will
surely
revisit
this
is
a
tasty
but
lightbodied
beer
it
is
bright
gold
with
tiny
bubbles
and
a
huge
white
head
that
slowly
shrinks
down
to
a
permanent
thin
head
thats
creamy
and
leaves
some
foamy
lace
the
aroma
is
tropical
fruit
banana
a
hint
of
pine
generally
rather
sweet
but
light
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
lot
of
light
fruit
citrus
hints
of
pine
and
herbs
and
some
yeast
it
has
a
light
sweetness
with
a
balancing
bitterness
and
a
very
faint
yeasty
sourness
its
light
and
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
very
satisfying
d
great

summer

beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
guy
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
easily
quaffable
that
long
finish
and
complex
mix
of
flavors
are
balanced
artfully
by
the
mediumlight
body
and
gentle
carbonation
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
one
of
the
beers
to
me
that
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
individual
parts
i
dont
typically
drink
this
style
and
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
again
but
for
what
it
is

really
liked

end
its
pretty
decent

large

leaves
some

even
with

o
while
this
wasnt
my

by
a

it
was
still

consider
this
one
a

375

picked
up
somewhere
in
denver
o
an
excellent
version
of
a
single
belgian
pale
ale
that
is
true
to
the
style
redemption
is
very
light
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
great
belgian
table
beer
that
is
smooth
and
refreshing
it
isnt
particularly
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
i
need
this
in
a
6pack
o
i
enjoyed
russian
rivers
redemption
more
then
id
expected
to
it
drinks
like
a
lemon
mimosa
its
light
and
really
quite
a
pleasant
sipper
though
i
typically
find
the
belgian
pale
style
to
be
quite
blasé
this
stands
out
very
well
done
and
something
id
certainly
return
to
pours
a
pale
yellow
almost
lemonade
color
with
a
small
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
citrusy
lemons
maybe
a
little
banana
or
clove
not
too
much
alcohol
up
front
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
to
me
while
this
maybe
a
good
session
beer
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
to
me
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
honestly
the
way
it
looked
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
and
i
really
like
russian
river
i
got
this
in
a
trade
but
the
sticker
on
it
says
6
99
if
i
paid
that
much
id
be
a
bit
disappointed
if
it
was
a
six
pack
that
cost
9
or
10
not
so
much
maybe
i
expect
too
much
from
russian
river
overall
my
first
belgian
single
and
its
pretty
much
the
perfect
summer
beer
if
this
stuff
was
half
the
price
i
would
constantly
drink
it
all
summer
long
at
5
15
abv
its
extremely
sessionable
light
and
airy
dry
and
fruity
not
sweet
but
grainy
hop
character
really
adds
a
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
finish
biscuity
and
delicious
for
such
a
mild
mannered
brew
good
stuff
this
is
more
of
a
beer
that
i
would
like
to
see
sold
in
6packs
for
89
bucks
than
a
single
expensive
bottle
though
id
drink
it
every
day
if
i
could
o
really
a
nice
beer
great
flavors
very
refreshing
but
still
low
in
abv
unfortunately
it
is
definitely
on
the
expensive
end
of
the
spectrum
for
the
beer
which
hurts
it
overall
still
a
nice
beer
though
if
and
a
big
if
rr
were
to
put
beers
in
6
packs
this
would
be
a
prime
candidate
lighter
medium
body
higher
carb
tingly
and
refreshing
dry
really
nice
example
of
the
style
great
flavor
another
hit
from
rr
very
drinkable
brew
but
a
bit
highpriced
for
the
experience
which
is
not
much
different
than
pbr
d
quite
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
intended
by
the
style
half
at
lunch
the
other
half
at
dinner
pours
hazy
straw
blonde
with
a
fluffy
white
cap
fine
carbonation
creeps
up
the
side
of
my
pint
glass
ya
thats
right
i
disobeyed
the
instructions
on
the
cork
deliberately
my
tulip
is
sitting
dry
tonight
smells
kind
of
like
a
bock
sort
of
metallic
slight
hay
sulfurous
aromas
not
very
appealing
for
me
taste
is
bock
like
but
with
a
pleasant
bitter
twang
to
offset
the
metallic
sulfur
notes
sligh
grain
flavors
followed
by
delicate
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
light
if
this
were
more
slick
like
sn
glissade
id
end
up
dumping
it
carbonation
is
medium
and
prickly
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
ill
finish
it
not
sure
id
revisit
it
though
if
it
werent
for
the
dry
bitterness
this
beer
would
be
undrinkable
for
me
a
lovely
blonde
ale
crisp
rather
dry
and
quite
flavorful
still
overall
no
complaints
its
actually
really
interesting
take
on
the
style
neat
i
think
i
really
like
it
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
not
to
many
thing
to
knock
this
brew
but
not
a
ton
of
standout
either
light
mouthfeel
and
crisp
taste
would
make
this
perfect
for
hot
summer
days
when
i
need
something
to
quench
my
thirst
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
job
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
beer
that
rr
has
done
a
nice
job
in
replicating
in
style
expensive
but
recommended
m
d
very
refreshing
crisp
finishes
very
well
good
balance
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
thus
far
very
good
overall
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
and
feels
a
bit
watery
the
flavors
balance
very
well
i
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
overall
love
russian
river
and
pretty
much
everything
they
do
this
doesnt
disappoint
overall
3
5price
and
packaging
do
not
affect
my
judging
of
a
beer
one
bitthis
is
one
fantastic
blonde
belgian
brew
well
carbonated
almost
too
much
well
balanced
and
very
robust
in
its
wheaty
grainy
and
zesty
approach
this
is
a
light
alcohol
full
flavored
brew
a
beef
of
mine
is
its
price
and
packaging
i
feel
a
brew
like
this
should
be
in
a
regular
bomber
for
about
6
perhaps
a
6pack
of
cans
around
11
yes
its
bottle
conditioned
well
made
and
i
am
sure
a
tedious
brew
but
this
is
2011
there
are
many
of
these
around
in
greater
quantities
for
much
less
money
d
drinkability
is
high
i
found
myself
drinking
this
very
quickly
without
realizing
it
it
has
an
addicting
finish
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
would
be
a
problem
if
it
werent
for
the
low
abv
pours
a
bright
but
hazy
golden
color
with
a
bone
white
head
head
is
thick
and
fizzy
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
scent
is
spicy
and
citrusy
taste
is
a
nice
balance
between
that
funky
belgian
yeast
flavor
a
nice
spiciness
and
some
faint
hop
notes
clean
and
crisp
and
a
little
fuller
than
i
expected
a
solid
brew
that
i
would
have
again
o
a
fantastic
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
at
around
5
abv
this
could
be
wonderfully
sessionable
if
only
it
were
easier
for
me
to
get
o
first
rr
belgian
and
was
very
pleased
with
it
will
have
to
get
another
one
sometime
d
lovely
beer
sipping
this
reminds
me
of
what
the
monks
would
drink
while
eating
their
bread
very
balanced
soft
and
delicate
with
great
earthy
musty
notes
balanced
with
spice
and
yeast
and
rounded
out
with
pears
and
soft
green
apples
overall
i
really
like
this
rendition
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
solid
belgian
pale
russian
river
has
executed
the
style
flawlessly
not
overly
complex
but
damn
drinkable
and
great
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
pales
to
date
wish
i
could
pick
this
up
nhvt
drinkable
yep
cheers
this
beer
is
an
example
of
when
ill
miss
the
drinkablility
scores
i
can
see
why
this
belgian
single
or
enkel
style
was
created
by
monks
for
their
table
beer
it
wont
overpower
any
meal
and
quenches
the
thirst
very
well
that
said
this
beer
really
has
no
wow
factor
at
all
and
is
pretty
light
on
flavor
taste
starts
off
unassumingly
dry
and
flat
then
flavor
seems
to
build
in
the
back
of
your
palate
slowly
billowing
forward
as
a
the
beers
unexpectedly
thick
mouthfeel
lingers
causing
multiple
swallows
all
the
components
are
expertly
balanced
yet
strikingly
separated
through
the
wonderfully
extended
tasting
process
the
flavor
is
pronounced
but
not
overwhelming
and
still
plays
perfectly
with
the
carbonation
and
slight
tartness
that
tanginess
makes
it
exciting
and
is
probably
most
defined
by
a
grapefruitlike
citrus
flavor
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
nice
and
mellow
some
good
fruitiness
and
grains
i
really
like
this
beer
and
am
glad
to
have
it
but
not
going
to
the
effort
it
takes
to
get
it
typically
many
thanks
to
augustgarage
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
long
time
want
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
very
light
yellow
hue
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
forms
a
top
layer
of
the
beer
smell
some
white
wine
flavors
tart
blonde
scent
taste
big
carbonation
hits
the
front
of
the
palate
light
airy
refreshing
the
white
wine
flavors
are
there
this
is
unlike
any
blonde
ale
i
have
ever
had
very
refreshing
i
would
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
this
beer
was
completely
worth
the
wait
a
perfectly
balanced
light
belgian
single
what
makes
it
so
unique
is
that
it
gets
at
citrusyfloral
notes
really
easily
but
isnt
too
lightheaded
it
balances
those
tastes
with
some
really
nice
medium
body
thats
both
smooth
and
sweet
i
hear
in
california
it
goes
for
5
a
bottle
and
thats
a
great
price
i
got
it
here
in
d
c
for
15
so
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
again
soon
but
i
cant
wait
until
i
can
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
also
like
that
they
chose
to
brew
this
as
a
single
a
very
unrepresented
subgenre
to
the
bpa
style
subtle
delicate
and
delicious
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
with
low
abv
and
good
flavors
but
not
crazy
intensity
solid
offering
although
not
one
of
their
home
run
beers
this
is
a
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
beer
subtle
complex
and
yet
still
very
accessible
yum
not
my
favorite
russian
river
brew
thats
some
tough
competition
but
there
was
a
nice
complexity
of
flavors
in
such
a
small
beer
really
refreshing
and
easydrinking
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
was
good
it
was
a
good
beer
overall
and
went
down
very
easy
this
evening
it
had
a
lot
of
bright
flavors
to
it
but
manged
to
stay
relatively
balanced
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
very
solid
beer
overall
style
ambiguitythis
beer
is
listed
on
ba
as
belgian
pale
ale
while
the
bottle
is
labelled
blonde
ale
on
the
front
and
belgian
style
single
implying
single
abbey
ale
or
aka
monks
table
beer
on
the
back
label
to
my
knowledge
and
looking
at
bjcp
style
guidelines
blonde
and
bpa
are
different
styles
it
would
not
surprise
me
in
the
least
to
learn
that
this
beer
is
a
belgian
style
singel
made
from
second
runnings
havent
had
a
rr
brew
in
years
cuz
i
cant
get
it
in
ct
this
is
just
great
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
this
was
6
for
the
corked
and
caged
375ml
bottle
served
at
room
temp
in
a
pint
glass
hazy
straw
with
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
some
light
brett
candy
malts
and
not
too
much
else
lacks
depth
taste
is
way
too
big
for
the
style
over
malted
and
way
too
boozy
not
very
sour
brett
is
quite
subtle
but
the
one
thing
that
is
on
target
for
teh
style
medium
body
way
thick
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
dont
brag
about
being
a
single
when
its
not
even
close
thanks
to
my
buddy
brian
for
picking
up
two
bottles
of
this
down
in
philly
he
brought
them
into
the
office
and
i
almost
popped
one
open
while
i
was
having
my
tuna
salad
sandwich
at
my
desk
but
i
did
the
prudent
thing
and
waited
till
i
got
home
gorgeous
color
after
pouring
most
of
the
bottle
into
a
burgundy
wine
glass
reminds
me
a
little
of
an
absinthe
louche
bready
and
sweet
smelling
head
has
mostly
dissipated
leaving
just
a
fine
whiteness
on
the
top
taste
is
clean
and
very
refreshing
i
like
this
carbonation
is
great
not
too
heavy
i
have
that
second
bottle
calling
my
name
the
flavor
zips
across
the
palate
with
a
dry
crackling
biscuit
malt
body
with
a
hint
of
honey
spiced
citrus
and
floral
hops
light
bubbly
body
fills
the
mouth
with
ample
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
crisp
and
well
carbonated
enough
to
add
some
substance
to
each
sip
overall
a
tasty
belgian
single
from
the
seemingly
unlimited
talent
at
russian
river
golden
clear
lots
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
head
quickly
disappears
left
in
its
wake
is
a
film
atop
this
beer
with
whats
left
collecting
at
the
edges
aroma
has
green
apples
and
spice
cinnamon
in
it
light
up
front
with
a
light
middle
that
has
apple
and
light
smoke
characteristics
very
light
finish
with
subtle
bitterness
light
body
and
very
drinkable
drinkabilty
this
aint
for
me
too
bland
and
flavor
easy
for
my
taste
i
didnt
care
for
the
sour
aftertaste
or
the
yeasty
wheat
flavor
tried
once
wont
bother
again
but
as
far
as
drinkabilty
its
only
5
15
if
your
a
fan
of
this
style
you
could
drink
it
all
night
im
sure
d
a
surprising
offering
for
russian
river
in
some
ways
its
a
little
below
the
radar
low
abv
but
there
is
something
special
about
it
its
simple
in
some
ways
yes
but
it
is
well
done
nothing
wrong
with
that
flavours
come
together
making
this
blond
very
drinkable
in
a
warm
day
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
there
are
immediate
scents
of
honey
and
lightly
toasted
cereal
as
the
beer
pours
it
is
a
slightly
hazy
vibrant
strawyellow
coloring
with
a
nice
thick
big
bubbled
head
on
further
nasal
investigation
you
get
some
citrus
highlights
with
some
underlying
coriander
spice
smells
really
good
the
beer
is
spicier
than
the
smell
lets
on
with
a
strong
coriander
and
a
bit
of
clove
flavor
sliding
along
the
slightly
lemonycitrus
malt
flavor
there
is
also
some
sour
characteristic
to
the
flavor
which
blends
with
the
beer
very
well
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
light
in
mouth
and
leaves
a
slightly
sour
and
spiced
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
that
transitions
into
a
slight
puckering
sour
if
you
space
out
the
sips
long
enough
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
and
the
lingering
tastes
are
pleasant
this
is
a
good
drinker
to
be
fair
this
was
consumed
after
younger
elder
and
sanctification
so
theres
a
great
chance
it
was
underwhelming
in
comparison
to
those
strongly
conceived
flavors
if
anything
is
delightfully
subtle
in
this
beer
it
was
probably
lost
due
to
its
placement
in
the
tasting
sorry
redemption
it
wasnt
planned
that
way
we
shall
meet
again
you
shall
receive
your
namesake
d
for
the
style
this
is
above
par
drinkability
is
definitely
notable
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
is
missing
here
something
seems
to
be
lacking
redemption
is
refreshing
light
on
the
palate
nicely
carbonated
and
crisp
on
the
palate
the
dry
finish
adds
a
nice
capstone
to
an
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
solid
bsa
d
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
it
wasnt
mind
blowing
by
any
means
solid
stuff
none
the
less
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
poured
from
bottle
batch
008
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
blonde
color
along
with
a
solid
white
head
and
good
lacing
throughout
the
session
dry
aromas
sweet
malts
and
pale
picking
up
some
honey
biscuits
with
a
light
flowery
hop
aroma
definitely
tasting
some
honey
like
butter
and
honey
on
a
biscuit
wonderful
pale
malts
lightly
hopped
with
notes
of
apricots
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
very
clean
and
crisp
along
with
decent
carbonation
throughout
d
this
is
my
idea
of
an
amazing
session
drinker
still
delivers
very
complex
flavors
while
remaining
light
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
great
beer
to
introduce
people
to
belgian
styles
very
well
done
another
score
from
russian
river
i
really
have
to
make
my
way
out
there
to
meet
brewer
drinkability
this
falls
under
the
radar
of
the
other
beers
in
the
russian
river
line
up
but
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
beer
was
poured
on
tap
in
traditional
tulip
with
very
little
head
color
is
golden
and
clear
with
some
carbonation
smell
is
of
belgian
yeasts
very
inviting
taste
is
similar
hard
to
describe
but
definitely
sweet
and
fruity
with
nice
belgian
yeast
flavors
mouthfeel
is
traditional
belgian
lively
nice
drinkability
this
beer
is
one
that
i
would
venture
to
call
very
sessionable
my
only
wish
is
that
this
was
summer
right
now
so
i
can
sit
on
the
porch
and
drink
several
of
these
drinkability
was
good
very
light
d
wow
at
only
5
15
this
one
is
an
all
nighter
if
you
can
afford
it
id
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
get
ahold
of
it
easier
overall
i
was
actually
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
in
terms
of
bpa
their
damnation
is
better
i
know
they
are
meant
to
be
different
but
this
one
just
didnt
wow
me
like
most
of
the
rr
stuff
does
its
almost
trying
to
be
a
sour
and
a
bpa
both
at
the
same
time
and
never
quite
is
either
still
a
solid
drinker
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
on
tap
full
disclosure
im
still
developing
my
palate
when
it
comes
to
sours
though
this
is
classified
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
of
the
ones
i
have
had
this
one
was
very
accessible
in
terms
to
drinkability
it
was
light
with
unique
characteristics
dry
and
would
make
a
good
summertime
beer
very
light
bodied
and
zesty
a
light
spicy
character
as
well
finishes
kinda
dry
this
is
refreshing
and
carbed
nice
like
all
rr
products
very
drinkable
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
pints
of
this
stuff
d
this
is
a
great
bpa
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
in
fact
im
guessing
this
is
the
base
beer
for
some
of
their
barrel
aged
brews
i
tossed
some
killer
cheese
at
this
and
wow
what
a
great
pairing
russian
river
never
fails
another
necessary
tick
for
my
rr

quest
big
thanks
goes
out
estocker
and
kshock
for
allowing
me
to
have
multiple
bottles
of
this
one
batch
008
served
from
bottle
into
a
bells
stemmed
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
three
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
and
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
wheat
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
dark
fruit
wheat
grain
and
subtle
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
this
one
honestly
reminded
me
of
a
hefe
on
the
aroma
in
a
way
on
the
flavor
it
felt
more
like
a
cross
between
a
belgian
pale
and
a
saison
this
was
nice
as
it
basically
kept
me
guessing
the
whole
time
pretty
nice
flavors
going
on
here
though
and
the
aroma
was
quite
excellent
an
absolute
must
try
without
doubt
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
wish
i
could
buy
it
near
me
i
found
this
very
enjoyable
but
would
not
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
got
this
as
a
extra
in
a
trade
and
am
very
happy
about
it
drinkability
this
a
nice
beer
with
some
delightful
qualities
but
i
would
probably
opt
for
a
a
slightly
heartier
beer
in
exhange
overall
this
is
probably
the
most
dissapointing
rr
beer
ive
had
crisp
and
bright
with
effervescent
bubbles
fade
to
a
warmer
chalky
esteryeast
feel
lingering
palate
coating
yeast
and
tart
with
mild
bitterness
one
of
if
not
the
most
complex
renditions
of
the
style
ive
had
when
it
comes
to
sours
its
hard
to
top
vinnie
and
the
folks
a
rr
d
finishes
wonderfully
clean
and
dry
so
that
you
cant
help
immediately
desire
another
sip
i
could
drink
this
one
after
another
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
kind
of
fluffy
but
thats
to
be
expected
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
dances
around
on
my
tongue
drinkability
is
definitely
high
on
this
one
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
this
would
make
for
a
very
refreshing
summertime
beer
i
guess
i
need
to
stock
up
on
some
since
the
warm
weather
is
coming
d
high
with
the
light
mouthfeel
complex
flavor
profile
i
could
definitely
session

one

very

a
fantastic
belgian
style
session
ale
d
this
kind
of
beer
just
isnt
my
personal
preference
d
this
is
a
superb
summer
beer
gotsta
get
me
some
more
d
goes
down
great
will
definitely
drink
more
often
and
put
into
the
rotation
drinkability
this
beer
is
super
solid
and
yet
i
still
used
the
word
delicate
twice
above
and
has
a
nice
light
body
that
doesnt
feel
like
its
going
to
weigh
you
down
and
an
abv
thats
very
moderate
at
just
over
5
nice
flavors
with
quite
a
bit
to
think
about
keeps
it
from
being
boring
as
well
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
and
affordable
this
could
become
a
staple
the
beer
was
almost
too
carbonated
for
me
it
was
also
pretty
light
amazing
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
the
golden
pour
with
a
slight
to
medium
head
i
was
anticipating
a
sweet
golden
ale
but
this
is
a
much
more
bland
pale
ale
with
a
slight
tart
nose
described
on
the
bottle
as
a
beer
that
is
enjoyed
by
monks
12
bottle
with
lunch
and
12
bottle
with
dinner
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
much
more
prevalent
on
mouthfeel
things
coming
to
mind
while
drinking
this
are
gym
socks
lagerish
lavender
and
malty
would
recommend
this
beer
for
the
price
but
probably
will
not
buy
again
taste
refreshing
and
light
spice
to
it
doesnt
do
the
odd
spice
or
belgian
clove
taste
even
better
really
crisp
one
of
my
favorite
summertime
beers
right
up
there
with
bruerys
hottfordavidleeroth
an
all
around
delicious
beer
not
as
complex
as
other
russian
river
offerings
but
i
dont
think
its
trying
to
be
complex
straight
forward
beer
a
delicate
wellexecuted
beer
i
can
see
it
having
strong
appeal
for
fans
of
witbier
and
saison
drinks
like
a
champ
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
another
this
isnt
typically
a
style
i
seek
out
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
solid
offering
from
this
great
brewery
recommended
d
the
low
abv
and
fairly
benign
taste
give
this
moderately
high
drinkability
drink
is
pretty
good
low
abv
delicate
and
tasty
the
bitterness
and
zest
gets
a
little
heavy
at
times
but
otherwise
pretty
nice
all
around
a
very
drinkable
beer
any
time
the
cpj
taste
is
very
mellow
and
tame
theres
not
a
lot
of
character
here
to
me
its
a
bit
light
and
forgettable
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
leaves
a
yeasty
flavor
quite
an
impressive
beer
here
no
flavors
are
too
strong
but
theyre
all
there
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
easily
drinkable
and
very
light
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
dancing
around
on
the
tongue
carbonation
was
less
than
expected
but
very
noticeable
still
and
pleasant
batch
002
dont
know
which
one
exactly
very
nice
for
the
style
so
crisp
and
surprisingly
complex
thanks
eric
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
dry
and
crisp
perfectly
carbonated
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
by
russian
river
d
its
a
decent
beer
but
cannot
compete
with
every
other
russian
river
beer
ive
ever
had
however
it
was
13
of
the
price
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
drinks
rather
well
a
bit
more
tartness
would
be
welcome
though
this
drinks
fine
as
is
russian
river
continues
to
impress
served
from
375ml
to
tulip
overall
a
wellbalanced
ale
that
doesnt
pack
a
lot
of
punch
rather
perfect
for
a
nice
midafternoon
aperitif
on
a
hot
summers
day
oh
and
i
didnt
have
a
proper
cheese
to
pair
it
with
at
the
time
so
i
consumed
with
fresh
banana
and
kiwi
and
the
combo
is
dessertlike
and
tasty
im
thinking
future
pairings
with
a
fruittartcustard
would
be
appropriate
anyway
what
a
beer
itll
be
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
foreseeable
future
d
excellent
this
would
be
a
big
hit
as
the
daily
beer
for
any
monk
around
light
on
the
palate
refreshing
full
of
flavor
d
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
awesome
and
reminds
me
a
little
of
westy
blonde
if
i
could
drink
this
everyday
i
would
amazing
beer
lovely
stuff
on
par
with
many
of
the
other
russian
river
offerings
dvery
drinkable
indeed
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
ales
but
this
hits
the
mark
nicely
d
can
russian
river
do
no
wrong
the
best
brewery
in
america
hits
another
home
run
with
redemption
d
described
on
the
bottle
as
an
abbey
single
be
sure
to
snag
it
up
because
this
is
a
real
winner

since
its
light

not

a

to

a

some

when

it
takes
on
an
overly

belgo

it

bad
o
delicious
and
well
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
the
hops
compliment
the
style
as
well
as
they
can
but
it
kind
of
just
makes
me
want
a
bpa
or
belgian
golden
strong
overall
4

a
belgian
ipa
done
the
vinnie
cilurzo
way
vinnie
seems
to
have
taken
the
belgian
ipa
style
and
put
his
own
twist
on
it
he
has
done
away
with
the
super
citrusy
piney
and
tropical
american
hops
in
conjunction
with
belgian
yeast
which
to
me
is
a
really
good
call
because
when
the
high
alpha
american
hops
are
used
in
tandem
with
the
naturally
very
fruity
estery
belgian
yeast
is
an
absolute
train
wreck
in
flavor
the
yeast
and
hops
just
fight
each
other
too
much
and
the
beer
tends
to
get
this
weird
peanut
butter
flavor
as
the
hops
start
to
oxidize
defenestration
does
not
suffer
from
these
qualms
at
all
the
yeast
esters
and
floral
hops
really
marry
well
together
and
they
coalesce
beautifully
in
the
incredibly
dry
finish
russian
river
does
an
incredible
job
as
usual
with
this
beer
o
great
beer
definitely
recommended
would
have
again
the
hop
profile
makes
this
a
unique
beer
and
a
very
tasty
one
at
that
refreshing
and
rewarding
o
not
really
getting
much
hops
for
a
hoppy
blonde
ale
i
would
peg
this
as
a
bit
above
average
overall
a
solid
belgian
pale
this
great
name
should
be
used
for
a
beer
more
worthy
of
it
pours
a
clear
gold
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
and
a
sticky
collar
of
lacing
throughout
strong
yeast
and
hop
aroma
earthy
and
musty
sweet
and
bitter
flavor
is
abrasively
bitter
throughout
clashing
with
the
sweet
belgian
yeast
and
ester
notes
very
green
herbal
and
earthy
which
doesnt
mesh
very
well
with
the
traditional
belgian
flavors
i
generally
dont
care
for
belgian
ipas
and
i
care
for
this
one
less
than
usual
o
i
liked
it
not
loved
o
i
would
love
to
give
this
one
another
try
its
a
pretty
beer
an
aromatic
beer
certainly
a
beer
worth
talking
about
but
that
night
the
beer
i
tried
really
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
d
a
very
pleasant
drinkable
beer
overall
delicious
i
love
when
this
is
on
tap
here
its
also
hard
to
beat
the
name
d
hoppy
profile
detracts
from
drinkability
for
me
still
a
brew
id
happily
enjoy
on
occasion
cheers
o
a
nice
belgian
offering
from
rr
quite
balanced
as
the
hops
are
really
held
in
check
by
the
creamy
malt
undertones
would
certainly
drink
this
again
clean
flavor
lightly
fruity
pear
esters
mild
malt
backbone
lingering
hop
bitterness
thats
also
a
bit
mild
a
clean
an
crisp
belgian
pale
easy
to
session
hoppy
doesnt
always
equal
ipa
in
this
case
the
beer
seems
to
be
mislabeled
here
as
a
belgian
ipa
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
exactly
a
huge
success
for
a
brewery
like
rr
light
bodied
with
a
lively
carbonation
that
didnt
attack
your
tongue
nice
and
refreshing
for
a
warm
sunny
day
outside
the
brew
pub
today
would
have
liked
fresher
tasting
hops
on
the
beer
though
a
decent
version
of
a
belgian
ipa
although
it
tastes
to
me
a
bit
too
vegetal
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
with
some
extra
hops
thrown
in
they
seem
to
be
noble
hops
as
opposed
to
american
its
not
especially
over
the
top
from
a
hops
perspective
the
hops
add
another
component
to
the
beer
but
it
still
maintains
its
belgian
characteristics
its
interesting
but
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
a
decent
beer
with
a
nice
aroma
with
the
mouthfeel
lets
it
down
really
wasnt
my
thing
even
if
i
can
tell
it
is
still
very
well
made
this
is
the
problem
a
belgian
ipa
can
be
one
of
two
things
one
being
far
superior
imo
it
can
either
be
a
hopped
up
belgian
ale
style
in
this
case
id
consider
this
beer
a
hopped
up
tripel
of
sorts
or
it
can
be
an
american
ipa
wort
fermented
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
the
second
i
find
more
appealing
and
better
than
the
first
easily
this
beer
should
have
been
blind
pig
with
the
damnation
yeast
oh
well
onward
and
upward
they
all
cant
be
winners
not
even
from
russian
river
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
with
a
twofinger
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
along
with
a
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
and
hops
contrary
to
many
belgian
ipas
it
seems
more
like
this
has
belgian
hops
in
it
based
on
my
limited
experience
it
seems
close
to
styrian
goldings
though
i
could
be
way
off
hops
dont
quite
complement
the
yeast
as
much
as
id
like
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
decent
but
not
russian
river
caliber
the
beer
is
golden
hued
and
mostly
clear
with
only
a
slight
haze
the
white
head
displays
lasting
retention
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
brings
yeast
malt
hops
spice
decent
flavor
with
everything
in
the
aroma
balanced
equitably
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
could
stand
more
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
coriander
comes
through
quite
a
bit
not
as
dry
as
i
would
like
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
customary
excellence
one
comes
to
expect
from
russian
river
very
good
worth
trying
it
is
a
fact
that
vinni
cilurzo
is
among
the
best
brewers
when
it
comes
to
both
belgianinspired
and
hoppedup
american
beers
argue
with
me
on
that
and
youre
arguing
against
many
thousands
of
others
too
hes
one
of
the
few
american
brewers
who
could
go
to
belgium
and
explain
to
the
islanders
how
to
cast
their
nets
and
hes
also
responsible
for
the
highest
rated
hop
bombs
is
it
any
surprise
that
a
combination
of
the
two
would
be
among
the
best
overall
this
was
a
nice
brew
the
spice
character
really
took
control
in
this
one
like
a
nice
authentic
belgian
pale
ale
and
the
hops
were
second
in
line
but
still
very
noticeable
well
done
jd
medium
bodied
with
dry
earthy
hops
up
front
which
are
countered
by
pale
malt
phenol
alcohol
and
estersyeast
that
give
of
hints
of
light
fruit
earthy
and
slightly
grassy
followed
by
sweet
light
fruit
notes
and
subtle
spice
hints
of
apple
and
pale
as
well
as
some
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
well
balanced
but
just
a
touch
too
much
alcohol
toward
the
dry
finish
d
very
drinkable
the
balance
of
the
belgian
and
american
elements
here
is
really
spot
on
a
present
a
nice
hybrid
beer
o
possibly
my
favorite
beer
of
the
day
bitter
and
spicy
quite
good
o
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
and
so
fresh
and
so
green
that
you
can
almost
feel
the
hops
in
your
mouth
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
that
i
did
not
enjoy
this
it
was
different
a
lighter
belgian
ipa
if
you
will
almost
like
a
bigger
redemption
o
twould
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
very
smooth
and
quite
tasty
i
approve
but
it
isnt
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
drink
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
thankful
for
this
growler
share
its
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
and
this
worked
in
its
favor
o
not
usually
a
big
belgian
ipa
fan
but
this
was
much
more
ipa
than
it
was
belgian
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
super
easy
to
drink
and
well
rounded
not
the
greatest
of
the
style
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
defenestration
was
a
really
great
beer
i
liked
it
all
the
way
through
with
little
to
no
faults
if
anything
maybe
a
little
bit
more
balance
between
yeasty
doughy
bread
and
hoppyness
d
surely
worth
a
try
went
down
easy
and
paired
great
with
the
super
spicy
sausage
platter
at
magnolia
not
a
favorite
but
would
have
if
it
were
distributed
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
a
fine
example
of
it
taste
mouthfeel
big
floral
hop
notes
with
a
complex
backbone
of
spice
banana
and
cracker
the
malt
foundation
is
simple
and
dry
light
in
body
crisp
drying
in
the
finish
bitter
enough
to
be
an
american
ipa
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
vinnie
shows
his
talent
for
hoppy
beers
once
again
here
the
yeast
provides
plenty
of
interesting
fruit
and
spice
flavor
without
overwhelming
the
hops
while
the
bonedry
malt
base
allows
the
hops
to
shine
through
in
all
their
complexity
beautifully
done
and
incredibly
drinkable
d
fine
in
terms
of
drinkability
probably
wont
get
it
again
though
only
because
of
the
myriad
of
other
great
beers
to
get
at
rr
drinkability
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
not
my
favorite
per
style
but
its
quite
good
worth
a
try
for
sure
defenestration
is
an
exceptional
beer
its
an
interesting
and
delicious
shoehorning
of
rrs
gigantic
ipa
style
into
a
belgian
i
would
love
another
glass
of
this
beer
because
there
was
a
lot
going
on
that
i
didnt
catch
from
my
initial
time
with
it
the
beer
pours
a
bright
gold
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
was
more
of
rrs
west
coast
hoppiness
than
i
was
prepare
for
it
looks
like
a
belgian
but
smells
strongly
of
pine
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
hops
come
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
there
are
also
some
earthy
notes
and
a
complexity
fruitiness
that
is
difficult
to
describe
there
was
caramel
and
bread
in
the
balancing
malt
i
really
should
have
bought
a
growler
of
it
that
big
west
coast
hoppiness
in
a
belgian
is
a
fine
treat
my
overall
impression
was
that
this
beer
is
good
but
nothing
crazy
delicious
served
from
a
growler
from
rrbc
appearance
a
cloudy
golden
hue
with
nice
lacing
smells
like
pliny
and
tastes
like
it
too
delicisous
with
nice
citrus
and
pine
notes
with
a
smooth
belgian
yeasty
finish
amazing
flavor
and
drinks
like
pliny
enjoy
some
if
you
can
an
interesting
ipa
with
the
floralness
from
the
hops
definitely
not
a
pine
oil
hopbomb
but
the
hops
are
definitely
still
there
overall
pretty
tasty
brew
the
taste
though
is
quite
good
its
nice
and
bready
with
hint
of
toasted
cracker
grapes
hints
of
raisin
and
buttery
caramel
a
hint
of
herbs
and
pine
plus
citrus
mostly
lemon
and
grapefruit
it
starts
sweetish
then
gradually
morphs
to
a
slightly
bitter
mostly
citrusy
finish
its
quite
nice
and
holds
up
well
another
recommended
beer
from
a
great
brewery
cool
aroma
some
citrus
slight
hop
and
a
bright
fresh
light
golden
aroma
very
drinkable
some
wheat
flavor
no
alc
noticable
sampled
from
a
growler
brought
to
the
07
speedway
ba
release
got
to
sample
a
couple
times
refreshing
brew
ment
for
a
hot
day
very
drinkable
thanks
for
the
sample
for
the
beer
knowledgeable
guy
who
brought
this
i
put
this
one
up
on
beer
advocate
as
a
belgian
ipa
because
this
is
what
they
call
it
i
brought
it
home
saturday
the
19th
in
a
growler
and
only
got
around
to
drinking
it
over
the
last
couple
nights
with
some
help
of
course
the
color
was
a
rich
gold
with
a
moderate
white
head
and
sticky
lacing
nose
is
very
yeasty
with
banana
grapefruit
and
there
are
hints
of
spices
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
excellent
as
are
many
rr
brews
with
moderate
carbonation
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
as
befits
something
called
an
ipa
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
an
interesting
brew
that
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
am
glad
i
brought
home
a
growler
a
perfectly
good
beer
as
a
bartender
this
one
is
great
to
use
as
an
introduction
to
the
world
of
belgians
cheers
tasty
and
very
much
drinkable
good
pilsener
for
casual
drinking
with
friends
light
and
sessionable
pretty
decent
outlier
detected
please
enter
at
least
five
words
i
ordered
the
palm
because
i
wanted
a
carribean
drink
and
all
they
had
was
red
stripe
so
i
went
for
the
belgium
beer
that
had
a
palm
on
it
hoping
for
the
best
what
i
got
was
thus
ultra
sweet
beer
that
i
would
just
have
to
say
was
made
for
the
ladies
very
smooth
more
of
an
irish
beer
taste
than
typical
belgian
solid
good
tasting
beer
not
the
best
belgian
but
good
stuff
the
taste
begins
with
a
good
malt
flavor
with
light
toasted
quality
with
a
slightly
phenolic
yeast
with
gentle
fruitiness
and
slight
spiced
flavor
with
a
dry
and
mildly
medicinal
taste
in
the
finish
this
is
a
simple
amber
no
frills
yet
easy
to
drink
with
some
belgian
yeast
character
i
would
drink
this
again
better
than
most
amber
ales
in
my
opinion
enjoyed
from
the
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
standard
belgian
pale
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lingers
and
solid
lacing
rather
clean
nose
of
light
caramel
malts
and
light
mild
hops
flavors
are
sweet
up
front
with
a
hair
of
bittering
to
the
back
a
little
light
bread
flavor
comes
through
the
aftertaste
good
carbonation
makes
for
a
lively
effervescent
mouth
feel
a
decent
session
belgian
pale
but
nothing
too
exciting
skunky
wtf
did
i
just
drink
this
dismal
ale
was
the
only
alternative
to
heineken
in
amsterdam
airport
watery
and
tasteless
borderline
drinkable
but
would
choose
pretty
much
anything
belgian
over
this
pours
a
clear
yelloworange
with
a
fizzy
head
that
doesnt
leave
trails
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
clean
with
some
malt
and
yeast
scents
but
nothing
too
overpowering
the
taste
was
well
balanced
between
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
with
some
bread
flavors
from
the
yeast
overall
a
very
decent
beer
that
does
everything
well
enough
a
better
version
of
heineken
still
not
all
that
good
but
totally
drinkable
yummy
in
my
tummy
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
bronze
amber
with
a
thin
patchy
white
head
that
leaves
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
and
light
patchy
lacing
aroma
of
bready
and
caramel
malt
light
overripe
stone
fruit
belgian
yeast
a
hint
of
toffee
flavor
is
a
lighter
version
of
the
aroma
with
a
similar
mixture
of
flavors
but
rather
attenuated
light
to
medium
bodied
hits
all
the
notes
for
a
belgian
pale
but
the
flavor
is
light
and
rather
bland
with
the
semisweet
malt
dominating
the
fruit
flavors
despite
being
light
itself
ill
hope
this
is
an
old
bottle
else
this
is
one
of
the
more
underwhelming
belgians
ive
tasted
satisfactory
with
no
offnotes
but
nothing
id
ever
try
again
started
enjoying
this
beer
while
earning
my
mba
at
the
cloverleaf
tavern
in
caldwell
nj
this
is
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
overpowering
overall
it
tastes
quite
like
i
imagine
the
child
of
amstel
and
kilkenny
would
if
they
could
have
a
child
it
feels
almost
like
a
beer
that
has
some
growing
up
to
do
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
at
the
same
time
far
from
the
best
thing
to
ever
come
out
of
belgium
o
is
it
a
watered
down
belgian
or
a
glorified
aa
lager
i
lean
towards
the
later
in
spite
of
its
classification
and
that
way
i
am
not
disappointed
not
nearly
the
gusto
flavour
and
impressiveness
of
others
in
this
category
such
as
orval
or
petrus
from
that
perspective
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
its
not
as
good
as
a
de
konninik
also
in
this
category
however
i
was
expecting
labatts
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
went
beyond
that
worth
a
try
but
not
too
many
accolades
from
me
would
go
well
with
pressed
sandwiches
that
are
still
hot
sampled
a
pint
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
halffinger
or
so
of
white
bubbles
on
top
aroma
largely
fruity
apple
pear
and
peach
notes
yielding
a
gummy
bearlike

no

phenols
although
micheal
jackson
writes
that
the
palm
yeast
strain
yields
a
dry
orange
character
and
i
can
certainly
taste
that
here
some
of
this
citrus
carries
over
into
the
semidry
finish
forgettable
when
compared
to
many
other
belgian
brews
although
enjoyable
enough
on

hot
patio
someone
told
me
this
is
the
beer
that
fat
tire
is
based
on
i
believe
them
the
malt
profiles
are
quite
similarand
quite

palm
doesnt
have
any
of
that
weird
burny
dryness
that
affects
the
back

of
most
of
new

brews
a
very
nice
malty
session
beer
i
really
enjoy
palm
it
has
a
great
crisp
taste
and
stands
up
well
as
an
accompaniment
to
food
or
as
a
solo
act
it
has
a
good
clean
aroma
and
has
a
nice
golden
sheen
when
poured
there
is
no
aftertaste
and
pours
well
it
does
not
have
the
full
body
flavor
of
its
neighbor
heineken
but
it
is
very
satisfying
even
though
i
only
had
one
of
these
it
would
have
been
possible
to
down
a
few
more
in
a
sitting
no
this
doesnt
stack
up
well
compared
to
the
heavier
hitters
and
trappist
beers
that
fall
into
this
category
but
as
a
starter
this
worked
out
fine
for
me
some
more
spice
and
strength
would
have
enhanced
this
nicely
but
ill
probably
give
this
a
go
again
soon
only
because
its
warm
out
and
its
nice
to
have
a
light
take
on
a
style

can

a

i
found
the

brews
i
have
passed
numerous
times
always
intending
to
try
and
never
quite
trying
its
inclusion
in
the
great
beers
of

forced
my

and
i
am

to
find
it
a

beer
drinking
isnt
really
a
competition
right
a

disappointment
they
are
probably
trying
to
get
stellas
market
share
but
is
even
worst
stay
away
a
simple
tasty
belgian
beer
would
get
it
again
overall
a
very
uninteresting
beer
it
is
better
than
a
good
deal
of
euro
lagers
but
probably
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
as
far
as
belgian
ales
are
concerned
not
one
to
waste
your
time
with
not
sure
why
this
is
rated
so
low
i
like
everything
about
it
the
pour
is

color
with
an
inch
of
white
fluffy
head
in
a
proper

globe
bubbles
shoot

nose
like

pop
the
nose
on
this
is
lighter
than
expected
not
a
high
dose
of
belgian
yeast
and
rich
red
malt
i
expected
but
rather
an
understated
mix
of
both
the
malts
arent
sweet
at
all
gentle
and
earthy
and
the
hops
are
floral
and
subtle
as
well
the
yeast
gives
this
beer
a
great
lightness
of
feel
and
an
easy
drinkability
sure
its
not
the
most
dynamic
flavor
profile
out
there
especially
coming
from
the
beer
motherland
but
this
is
a
perfectly
sessionable
beer
far
superior
to
so
many
american
reds
its
got
a
very
clean
feel
and
finish
refreshing
overall
this
beer
probably
deserves
a
little
more
respect
although
ive
never
had
the
bottled
version
and
the
tap
might
make
it
a
whole
lot
better
had
it
at
trattoria
newbury
that
has
a
3
draft
night
all
the
time
so
i
reviewing
this
considering
it
was
cheap
good
start
pours
an
amber
color
from
what
i
can
see
the
smell
is
mass
market
lagerish
this
was
a
beer
that
stayed
well
carbonated
trying
to
stay
positive
taste
is
kind
of
yeasty
a
little
malty
with
a
chemical
kind
of
taste
this
is
a
very
poor
beer
that
thankfully
has
belgium
on
its
name
reminder
to
me
stop
ordering
this
lighter
in
flavor
than
expected
the
malt
character
dominates
but
i
anticipated
more
yeast
contribution
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
does
not
have
me
jumping
for
joy
either
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
dont
love
it

overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
wont
blow
anyone
away
but
that
everyone
should
enjoy
tough
beer
to
buy
because
i
never
know
how
long
its
been
sitting
on
the
shelves
which
is
why
im
pleased
to
find
it

even

its
pretty

and

flavors
that
i
happen
to
enjoy

good

i
had
expected

for

on

the

night
poured
an

again
clean
on
the
palate
with
very
mild
yeasty
spiced
notes
to
mix
with
some
grain
and
a
little
honey
sweetness
you
can
tell
this
is
a
more
mass
produced
beer
it
lacks
alot
and
is
very
average
i
am
watching
drinking
made
easy
while
enjoying
this
beer
great
show
as
is
three
sheets
if
you
have
not
seen
these
shows
look
them
up
on
youtube
or
do
as
i
have
and
purchase
the
dvds
they
are
awesome
and
hilarious
all
beer
drinkers
or
drinkers
in
general
should
see
them
all
this
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
a
cross
between
a
grassy
adjunct
lager
and
a
pilsner
the
taste
is
a
god
awful
grainy
grass
flavor
that
tastes
very
similar
to
red
dog
thin
texture
very
little
flavor
and
cheap
taste
does
not
make
this
beer
very
desirable
i
tried
it
once
but
never
again
this
is
a
review
of
the
unfiltered
version
served
on
draught
in
a
restaurant
in
gent
this
ale
has
the
appearance
of
many
unfiltered
wheat
beers
cloudy
and
dark
straw
colored
with
a
weak
white
head
aroma
and
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
wheat
and
barley
malt
very
slight
spicy
hop
character
extremely
high
drinkability
havent
tried
the
filtered
bottle
version
but
this
baby
was
solid
recommended
o
overall
a
great
example
of
your
typical
belgian
ale
nothing
to
extreme
or
awesome
but
good
beer
served
at
bier
market
in
toronto
paired
with
chicken
schnitzel
and
belgian
waffles
very
weak
ale
amber
colored
with
a
film
of
a
head
just
an
average
sweet
malt
taste
would
not
recommend
with
a
sweet
food
such
as
the
honey
drizzled
waffles
however
was
a
good
match
for
the
chicken
schnitzel
the
body
and
flavor
are
thin
and
lifeless
head
dissipates
quickly
arroma
has
a
touch
of
biscuit
but
overall
an
insipid
beer
why
would
they
do
this
to
water
had
on
tap
in
a
tulip
glass
poured
to
a
nice
biscuit
head
which
dissipates
shortly
with
little
lacing
appearance
was
a
clear
amber
to
copper
color
aroma
was
light
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
taste
was
grainy
and
lightly
hopped
with
hints
of
caramel
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
with
a
nice
dry
bitter
aftertaste
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
disappointing
and
i
dont
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
belgian
pale
ale
aspects
that
i
like
about
this
style
were
on
the
light
side
and
there
were
just
too
many
off
flavors
for
this
to
be
a
decent
beer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
and
the
body
was
on
the
lighter
side
but
the
flavor
didnt
hold
my
attention
and
i
was
over
it
after
the
first
couple
sips
if
i
had
to
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
grab
another
so
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
that
i
thought
was
fairly
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
and
aroma
they
both
werent
good
with
too
many
off
flavors
and
aromas
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
pretty
easy
to
find
a
much
better
belgian
pale
ale
it
was
pretty
inexpensive
and
now
i
know
why
not
recommended
to
anyone
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
let
down
with
beer
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
and
the
added
metallic
and
skunky
flavors
and
aromas
really
hurt
this
beer
this
was
my
first
experience
with
palm
and
it
made
for
a
poor
first
impression
im
still
down
to
try
more
of
their
brews
but
after
this
one
i
for
sure
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
belgian
beer
it
needs
a
lot
of
work
overall
well
i
have
something
of
a
soft
spot
for
this
one
when
i
went
to
belgium
last
year
i
checked
into
the
flat
we
rented
and
walked
straight
out
to
find
beer
this
was
the
first
one
i
came
across
yes
its
like
the
budweiser
of
belgium
but
you
never
forget
your
first
i
like
it
in
part
for
the
nostalgia
another
inbev
disaster
had
this
ontap
at
an
american
woodfired
pizza
venue
decent
amber
color
but
ultrathin
tasting
nothing
belgian
about
this
no
odor
or
nose
to
speak
of
either
i
kept
wanting
a
hint
of
flavor
but
practically
no
grain
and
no
hopping
evident
watery
mouthfeel
too
as
the
menu
had
no
prices
for
drinks
i
had
to
ask
the
waitress
what
i
was
paying
for
this
beer
hoping
it
wasnt
a
6
pint
she
assured
me
it
was
only
3
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
i
wont
make
the
mistake
of
ordering
this
again
as
a
fan
of
belgian
beers
from
gulden
draak
to
maredsou
to
kwak
this
beer
delivered
nothing
of
the
character
or
malty
goodness
of
those
a
bit
of
research
online
shows
this
to
be
another
inbev
disaster
which
means
to
find
it
ontap
at
a
mainstream
bar
means
this
is
budweiser
product
this
one
is
to
be
avoided
overall
not
very
impressive
i
had
never
had
it
before
today
and
i
think
i
had
higher
expectations
could
be
a
pizza
burger
beer
something
to
not
think
too
much
about
as
it
washes
down
the
chow
bottle
looks
nice
with
the
red
green
and
horse
art
this
beer
is
amber
clear
color
foamy
head
hint
of
sweet
honey
medium
carbonation
bit
dry
aftertaste
and
slightly
skunky
notes
of
caramel
grain
and
light
hops
in
taste
overall
decent
average
beer
a
beer
that
could
only
be
dreamed
up
in
a
lab
after
copious
tasting
panels
and
adjustments
to
ensure
that
it
appeals
to
the
market
which
is
to
say
a
lame
market
not
something
that
i
would
ever
buy
but
hey
this
is
the
finest
of
belgium
ummm
ok
not
much
above
a
drainpour
unless
its
icecold
overall
a
basic
pedestrian
ale
with
not
much
to
offer
flavor
wise
uneventful
o
easydrinking
smooth
and
pleasant
nothing
special
but
at
the
same
time
an
above
the
average
belgian
session
ale
recommended
overall
its
been
a
while
since
ive
opened
a
beer
and
smelled
such
a
high
amount
of
skunk
the
scent
seemed
to
die
down
and
the
beer
got
better
as
i
progressed
through
my
glass
but
this
is
still
nothing
that
warrants
drinking
again
o
decent
belgian
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
belgian
brew
but
worth
the
try
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
an
alternative
to
pilsners
and
lagers
and
found
it
to
be
a
pleasant
easydrinking
beer
that
deserves
more
than
a
single
try
overall
palm
is
a
decent
beer
i
like
pale
ales
and
this
ones
not
too
bad
nothing
sticks
out
that
would
make
me
go
to
a
store
and
buy
a
six
pack
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
not
too
heavy
on
flavor
or
aroma
but
very
drinkable
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
creamy
head
good
lacing
scent
of
grassy
malt
a
bit
of
oak
and
some
earthiness
with
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
somewhat
weak
for
the
style
tastes
kind
of
watered
down
with
some
light
hoppiness
and
a
sourdough
taste
light
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
strong
and
detracts
even
more
from
the
taste
has
a
sharp
aftertaste
too
wouldnt
recommend
when
theres
so
many
more
in
this
style
that
are
arguably
far
better
there
might
even
be
a
few
mass
produced
beers
id
consider
over
this
one
the
beer
appeared
to
be
light
copper
in
color
with
noticeable
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
produced
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
was
well
retained
that
subsided
into
a
nice
half
finger
cap
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
was
light
sweet
malts
mainly
with
an
ever
so
slight
earthygrassy
hop
the
flavor
of
the
beer
followed
the
aroma
a
light
mainly
sweet
malts
and
some
yeast
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
but
had
good
carbonation
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
was
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
a
decent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
probably
pick
before
your
typical
mass
brewed
american
beers
pours
a
dark
golden
copper
color
with
about
a
one
finger
white
head
that
reduced
into
a
filmy
layer
the
aroma
has
just
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
with
some
grassy
hop
in
the
background
some
earthy
tones
as
well
along
with
bread
the
taste
is
smooth
nice
and
easy
drinking
with
some
more
of
that
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
lemony
hops
more
bread
and
a
slightly
metallic
finish
the
beer
is
light
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
honestly
thought
this
beer
would
have
more
flavor
it
didnt
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
simple
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
again
served
from
tap
into
a
tulip
poured
redorange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
earth
earth
hop
and
caramel
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
cream
and
caramel
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
i
had
heard
quite
a
bit
about
this
one
from
numerous
people
but
i
have
no
idea
why
they
were
raving
over
this
one
the
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
were
very
weak
in
intensity
there
were
some
good
notes
in
the
aroma
but
you
had
to
work
so
hard
to
find
them
it
was
ridiculous
the
flavor
on
the
otherhand
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
definitely
average
for
the
style
as
nothing
stood
out
at
all
worth
trying
but
i
doubt
i
will
be
doing
so
again
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
sessionable
the
beer
has
a
very
good
appearance
and
i
feel
like
i
needed
to
review
this
one
since
i
frequently
review
from
my
palm
glass
final
grade
2
63
an
unmemorable
c
minus
to
be
fair
palms
label
admits
that
there
is
corn
in
here
so
it
was
a
bit
doomed
from
the
start
there
are
so
many
high
quality
belgian
pale
ales
out
there
to
compare
it
to
and
the
ones
i
have
tried
all
compare
favourably
to
this
the
relative
blandness
makes
it
easy
to
throw
back
quickly
but
most
people
who
bother
will
probably
find
it
to
be
an
almost
completely
forgettable
glass
of
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
were
being
offered
but
i
dont
plan
to
revisit
it
its
a
decent
beer
when
nothing
else
is
available
its
certainly
better
than
heineken
certainly
better
than
the
average
americanadjunk
offerings
o
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
light
bodied
goes
down
easy
makes
me
feel
like
i
should
be
mowing
the
lawn
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
grain
with
some
toffee
honey
and
graham
cracker
notes
the
flavor
is
similar
with
the
grain
coming
through
the
strongest
i
also
get
some
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
toffee
and
bread
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
bland
but
nothing
offensive
easy
to
drink
o
pairs
well
with
food
but
is
generally
uninteresting
on
its
own
not
terrible
but
not
worth
the
price
not
sure
if
they
were
going
with
a
beer
to
compete
against
stella
as
a
bpa
i
find
this
beer
to
be
extremely
boring
i
guess
i
am
not
digging
the
yeast
that
they
used
perhaps
a
good
alternative
to
a
heineken
or
euro
mass
produced
lagers
overall
a
very
average
beer
no
reason
to
seek
this
out
d
now
i
like
palm
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
could
replace
my
usual
lagers
and
pilsners
that
i
drink
after
a
long
day
at
work
but
after
having
it
continuously
for
almost
a
week
i
find
it
a
bit
boring
to
tell
the
truth
still
a
good
beer
to
break
the
routine
every
once
a
while
this
was
an
ok
beer
i
thought
it
was
much
too
thin
for
the
style
and
the
flavor
was
lacking
a
bit
could
use
less
carbonation
o
average
about
sums
it
up
wouldnt
refuse
another
but
certainly
not
going
to
seek
one
out
this
is
as
underwhelming
as
it
gets
there
isnt
anything
memorable
about
this
one
ill
pass
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
tan

that
settles
to
a
small

of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace

around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grainmalt
caramel
and
some
slight
yeast
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
a
bit
watery
overall
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
at
least
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
this
isnt
a
stye
id
choose
regularly
but
a
beer
ive
seen
repeatedly
and
wanted
to
give
it
a
shot
glad
i
did
but
am
unlikely
to
purchase
future
bottles
overall
a
pretty
generic
amber
ale
with
a
great
drinkability
there
is
not
much
thing
to
expect
just
average
pale
ale
out
of
a
bottle
belgiums
amber
beer
was
a
clear
apricot
orange
color
with
a
good
amount
of
rising
carbonation
and
a
thin
skim
of
offwhite
head
the
retention
was
less
than
impressive
and
it
only
left
small
spots
of
lacing
like
far
away
stars
the
aroma
was
mostly
euro
palelager
malts
with
the
typical
strong
emphasis
on
grains
and
a
light
undertone
of
adjunct
grains
the
flavors
were
well
exactly
like
the
aroma
suggested
not
exactly
belgiums
finest
still
it
was
not
unpleasant
in
any
way
just
right
down
the
middle
and
what
it
lacked
in
complexity
it
made
up
for
in
drinkability
very
well
balanced
and
highly
sessionable
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
light
and
the
carbonation
good
ok
beer
for
me
it
comes
across
as
part
light
amber
ale
and
part
adjunct
lager
for
9
a
sixpack
there
are
better
options
pours
a
medium
hued
amber
with
a
nice
white

taste
is

some
grassy
notes
finishes
with
some
lightly
toasted
caramel
malts
end
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
and
bit
of
funkiness
some
light
bitterness
a
nice
light
to
medium
body
and
crisp
mouth
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
bit
light
for
an
amber
style
ale
not
the
worst
but
there
are
plenty
better
brews
o
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
id
seek
out
again
o
a
very
underwhelming
beer
not
much
different
than
american
amberred
lagers
i
have
had
definitely
will
keep
passing
by
this
jd
o
this
is
a
trainwreck
that
is
okay
at
best
but
there
has
to
be
better
options
dont
expect
much

kinds
of

just
rushing
up
and
sticking
to
the
edge
of

the
mouthfeel
is
as
watery
and
fizzy
as
this
led
me
to
expect
but
the
taste
is
really
sweet
sugars
malts
a
bit
of
apricot
and
some
earthy
hops
in
the
end
but
mostly
sugars
overall
a
quite
onenote
belgian
macro
nice
enough
to
drink
but
one
was
enough
for
me
odmediocre
and
unmemorable
not
awful
just
pretty
bland
could
have
been
much
worse
m
sweet
in
general
with
some
balancing
points
of
hops
basically
but
not
to
bitter
balanced
and
with
good
medium
lasting
o
very
drinkable
a
nice
blend
of
two
styles
amber
belgium
very
smooth
and
mellow
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
someone
looking
for
a
smooth
and
malty
alternative
too
the
average
ale
i
would
not
look
to
this
as
a
true
belgian
ale
offering
but
as
a
beer
that
is
more
interesting
and
has
a
wider
appeal
this
is
a
great
notes
this
moderatebodied
beer
has
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
its
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
in
the
world
but
its
still
pretty
good
a
great
session
brew
affligem
still
likely
my
favorite
of
the
sessionable
belgian
pale
ales
but
this
is
really
good
and
drinkable
nice
scent
which
is
belgian
in
style
with
the
fruitiness
but
not
too
far
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
and
i
agree
o
updated
this
beer
was
better
than
i
remember
the
first
time
initial
review
frankly
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
was
well
balanced
but
not
very
flavorful
overall
drinkability
this
beer
is
really
strange
i
really
want
to
like
it
it
has
some
different
qualities
that
make
me
like
it
but
on
the
other
hand
the
offcharacters
are
so
prominent
that
i
cant
help
but
admit
i
cant
enjoy
it
its
really
a
chore
to
drink
and
i
would
really
never
again
try
this
in
my
life
but
its
definitely
interesting
its
entirely
possible
i
just
got
a
skunked
bottle
because
based
on
the
other
reviews
it
doesnt
seem
like
im
supposed
to
be
getting
what
i
am
o
i
liked
this
beer
pretty
well
for
its
maltslanted
character
but
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
malt
complexity
and
maybe
some
belgian
yeast
notes
all
in
all
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
and
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
in
the
future
palm
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
moving
from
bmc
to
better
beer
cheers
very
drinkable
beer
here
albeit
a
pretty
simple
one
id
choose
this
one
any
day
versus
most
of
the
euro
lagers
that
i
see
in
mass
quantities
when
i
go
to
the
store
the
beer
leaves
a
little
metallic
aftertaste
well
carbonated
leaves
me
and
my
mouth
feeling
bubbly
d
great
drink
very
enjoyable
low
alcohol
content
but
packed
with
roasted
malt
and
biscuit
flavor
give
it
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
this
ale
fails
if
this
was
an
english
pale
ale
i
would
give
it
an
average
score
o
a
pathetic
brew
that
doesnt
deserve
to
associate
itself
with
its
great
country
at
least
stella
while
light
is
well
composed
this
brew
is
a
mess
not
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
experiences
thats
for
sure
o
too
sweet
for
my
taste
buds
for
a
pale
ale
that
is
it
seems
to
me
this
is
more
of
an
amber
ale
than
anything
i
thought
at
first
i
was
reviewing
the
wrong
beer
but
this
is
how
it
is
titled
so
it
must
be
right
just
didnt
bring
it
too
expensive
to
be
part
of
a
regular
lineup
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
sdibf
and
not
drop
serious
cash
pass
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
as
ive
been
in
search
of
a
good
summer
session
ale
for
a
while
im
very
disappointed
in
it
based
on
price
and
what
could
have
been
for
8
50
a
sixpack
11
2
ounce
bottles
i
expect
something
more
than
a
thin
nearly
tasteless
ale
i
was
not
expecting
a
flavor
punch
in
the
mouth
but
what
taste
there
was
mainly
came
from
a
slightly
metallic
and
sour
aftertaste
nice
looking
head
pretty
amber
color
liquid
and
decent
amount
of
alcohol
5
4
but
totally
blah
when
it
comes
to
taste
poured
from
a
tap
into
a
goblet
color
was
dark
red
almost
brown
about
1
34
inches
of
head
smelled
fairly
hoppy
heavy
smell
but
rich
and
flavorful
not
too
much
carbonation
pleasantly
bitter
and
didnt
taste
much
like
the
smell
it
somehow
got
better
as
it
went
on
very
smooth
taste
for
the
high
hops
poured
at
the
sharp
edge
bistro
on
penn
a
crystal
clear
amber
body
with
a
white
head
fine
even
lacing
aroma
has
a
mild
nuttiness
with
tame
fruits
nice
cereal
grains
with
a
pretty
bland
nose
as
a
whole
flavor
wise
is
very
much
like
any
boring
amber
ale
but
with
a
heavy
price
tag
in
this
case
it
was
like
7
50
for
a
standard
pour
in
a
signature
glass
semi
sweet
grassy
herbal
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
biscuit
malt
backing
it
all
up
let
me
down
a
very
one
dimensional
snooze
alert
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
really
no
fireworks
overall
really
not
interesting
enough
to
peak
my
interest
ever
again
a
beer
that
is
belgian
but
the
age
of
mass
produced
marketing
campaign
in
belgian
ales
that
theme
carried
over
to
the
flavor
which
was
malty
sweet
but
kept
refreshing
by
the
fruity
notes
not
at
all
complex
and
i
doubt
i
would
drink
many
still
it
was
refreshing
on
an
unusually
hot
day
in
grand
rapids
mi
this
tastes
more
like
a
malty
amber
style
ale
d
not
terribly
impressive
it
looks
good
but
it
really
goes
downhill
from
there
the
aroma
is
very
lightly
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
musty
hops
i
tend
to
associate
this
hop
profile
more
with
british
ales
but
it
is
not
entirely
out
of
place
in
a
belgian
the
flavor
is
disappointing
with
a
weak
malt
profile
that
turns
a
bit
sour
in
the
finish
and
hops
that
are
again
a
bit
musty
for
the
style
not
a
very
good
beer
and
not
one
that
i
would
drink
again
o
forgettable
and
pedestrian
could
give
belgian
beer
a
bad
name
disclaimer
i
expect
any
countrybrewerybrewer
is
capable
of
making
both
awesome
and
terrible
beers
but
given
the
pedestal
belgians
are
put
on
this
was
a
big
dissapointment
palm
is
a
fairly
inoffensive
beer
that
isnt
very
interesting
it
isnt
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
it
either
o
this
is
an
incredibly
average
and
totally
forgettable
beer
od
not
too
bad
but
not
overly
interesting
a
standard
beer
with
more
complexity
than
north
american
macros
but
not
a
whole
lot
to
go
on
besides
that
this
is
a
good
beer
for
people
that
cant
handle
strong
beer
flavors
if
you
are
a
member
on
here
then
this
beer
probably
isnt
for
you
overall
this
is
just
another
euro
macro
style
nothing
worthy
at
all
light
watery
flavorless
and
slightly
skunky
not
worth
the
import
pricetag
at
all
palm
gives
you
an
idea
of
belgiums
rich
distinctive
brewing
culture
only
as
much
as
paris
depicts
the
whole
of
france
or
for
that
matter
how
well
you
can
say
you
know
london
because
you
had
a
layover
in
heathrow
it
is
only
belgian
at
all
in
that
its
brewed
there
and
because
it
tries
to
emulate
stella
artois
and
even
at
that
it
does
a
poor
job
definitely
pass
from
what
i
understand
this
beer
is
made
with
all
european
ingredients
it
tastes
very
english
even
though
its
made
in
belgium
this
is
one
of
the
only
amberesque
ales
i
have
enjoyed
this
is
clearly
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
work
put
into
it
but
clearly
not
as
special
as
beers
i
am
used
too
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
dry
roast
and
somewhat
floral
in
the
taste
flowery
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
earth
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
earthy
and
floral
like
aftertaste
ok
quite
flowery
and
nice
caramel
but
overall
eh
i
have
no
idea
what
this
stuff
is
but
it
does
have
some
beery
qualities
so
drink
up
or
pour
it
out
and
lets
have
something
better

the
maber

is
clean
and
crisp
as
a
whole
with
little
head
but
a
fine
enough
malty
aroma
the
body
is
creamy
and
medium
the
taste
is
full
of
sweet
caramel
malts
with
an
ok
lighty
hoppe
ending
it
tastes
like
it
supposed
to
and
is
pleasant
enough
in
its
own

palm
pours
out
as
an
amber
colored
brew
with
a
tannish
white
head
that
had
some
pretty
good
retention
the
aroma
of
the
beer
had
some
sweet
malt
and
yeast
in
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
followed
the
same
guide
lines
this
beer
had
a
decent
amount
of
flavors
in
it
there
was
a
sweetness
in
the
beer
that
was
pleasant
and
it
had
some
hops
in
the
background
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
but
it
wasnt
the
greatest
belgian
beer
by
any
means
its
an
average
brew
to
say
the
least
o
this
is
a
fairly
impressive
big
name
belgian
pale
ale
stuff
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
put
back
large
quanities
of
this

as
no
more
than
a
light
import
to
have
in
leiu
of
a
bmc
not
really
somehting
to
seek
out
if
your
looking
for
a
belgian
style
beer
o
its
an
average
belgian
pale
ale
its
like
a
sweet
pilsner
with
a
bitter
bite
tastes
ok
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
the
character
comes
from
the
sugars
rather
than
the
yeast
but
its
quite
refreshing
and
flavorful
had
this
on
tap
at
finnegans
in
yorktown
heights
truly
the
best
offering
they
carried
as
it
was
saddled
up
next
to
bud
light
stella
blue
moon
and
a
few
other
adjuncts
actually
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
see
dark
golden
coloring
head
had
already
dissipated
by
the
time
the
server
brought
it
over
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
really
stood
out
carbonation
was
moderate
and
it
went
down
smooth
if
im
back
at
finnegans
it
is
what
i
will
order
but
other
than
that
im
not
searching
it
out
again
overall
this
beer
just
isnt
my
favorite
i
was
told
to
compare
it
to
fat
tire
by
a
representative
and
it
falls
a
bit
short
the
grape
flavor
and
smell
kept
bugging
me
i
see
by
the
reviews
it
didnt
rate
to
high
but
sometimes
simple
and
mild
are
better
bold
and
in
your
face
that
said
my
review
pours
light
clear
copper
in
color
with
half
inch
off
white
head
and
a
light
lace
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slightly
earthy
smell
to
it
as
well
sweet
taste
malty
has
a
light
taste
of
tea
meduim
body
and
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
buy
again
cheers
drinkability
overall
this
beer
was
in
offensive
certainly
and
had
some
decent
aspects
to
it
but
was
really
just
to
sweet
lacking
more
other
aspects
would
be
really
hard
to
imagine
sitting
around
drinking
this
beer
all
night
because
would
really
just
become
to
much
its
smoothness
is
its
strong
point
but
its
sweet
malt
bombyness
is
for
me
anyway
bit
to
much
didnt
hate
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
drinkability
a
nice
session
beer
not
something
ill
revisit
often
but
an
occasional
addition
pours
amber
and
clear
with
very
good
head
scent
of
slightly
skunky
hop
and
malt
flavor
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
maltiness
in
the
finish
is
nice
great
soft
mouthfeel
not
a
bit
unpleasant
but
not
for
the
sweetness
very
drinkable
id
recommend
1
or
2
but
no
more
palm
pours
a
totally
translucent
amber
to
burnt
orange
theres
no
head
to
speak
of
but
that
may
be
at
least
in
part
due
to
a
bad
pour
theres
just
a
bit
of
bready
malts
in
the
aroma
not
bad
but
where
are
the
pears
and
green
apples
along
with
a
pinch
of
clove
and
a
noble
hop
herbal
note
everything
really
struggles
to
come
through
at
all
though
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
its
not
awful
but
the
malt
profile
is
wrong
for
the
style
and
the
overall
impact
is
still
a
bit
dull
the
beers
got
a
little
bit
of
body
to
it
just
enough
heft
for
the
style
the
carbonations
not
ideal
for
the
style
its
a
little
bit
light
but
its
still
got
enough
presence
to
be
serviceable
palms
not
a
terrible
beer
but
were
it
not
for
the
cloverleafs

dont
think
id
bother
ordering

i
could
drink
one
of
these

thats
it
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
way
it
looks

the
glass
wow
the
most
american
styled

a
particularly
unflattering
way
belgian
offering
that
ive
ever
tasted
not
worthy
enough
though
to
actually
recommend
beyond
the
curio
factor
as
belgium
has
so
much
more
better
stuff
to
explore
beer
is
thin
and
grainy
and
sweet
it
finishes
with
this
slight
acidity
and
huskiness

the

thing
goes

not
really
what
i
expected
i
most
likely
wont
buy

it

aftertaste

in
my
past
years
before
i
discovered
craftreal
ale
i
thought
this
was
the
best
thing
ever
and
would
plough
through
them
now
one
is
enough
i
still
like
it
eventhough
ive
had
much
better
d
odd
but
not
particularly
great
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
jump
to
it
a
bit
of
a
letdown
if
you
are
expecting
a
big
european
taste
very
muted
flavor
but
nothing
bad
which
makes
it
drinkable
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
but
you
wont
be
blown
away
taste
is
clean
crisp
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
less
complex
than
a
typical
belgian
pale
but
solid
drinkability
drinks
like
a
lager
tastes
like
an
ale
all
told
very
nice
not
bad
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
pale
ales
made
here
in
the
states
that
are
at
least
as
good
as
this
beer
and
are
sold
at
a
much
more
favorable
price
point
not
sure
i
can
ever
see
myself
getting
another
glass
of
this
stuff
pours
a
sparkling
amber
in
color
and
is
wellcarbonated
the
aroma
is
bright
both
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
the
beer
drinks
light
refreshing
with
a
nice
slight
caramel
sweetness
balanced
with
a
slight
tart
hoppiness
very
well
balanced
and
proportioned
this
could
be
used
as
a
session
beer
this
was
just
brought
into
the
control
board
in
ontario
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
with
small
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
grassy
hops
and
some
belgian
yeast
quite
mild
tasting
some
bitterness
and
sweetness
very
smooth
carbonation
a
nice
enough
beer
but
nothing
to
be
excited
about
fairly
high
carbonation
level
works
with
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
though
it
went
well
with
food
this
is
truly
an
amber
ale
and
definitely
not
a
pale
ale
sort
of
like
a
slightly
more
refined
yuengling
oddly
enough
decent
had
a
palm
on
tap
this
past
weekend
at
brasserie
gaslight
in
the
south
end
served
in
a
branded
palm
goblet
dark
orange
color
with
a
nice
contrasting
white
head
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
some
decent
lacing
a
nice
looking
beer
when
served
in
its
own
glass
smell
was
a
bit
spicy
and
had
some
grass
clippings
aroma
also
taste
was
good
the
flavor
had
a
great
malt
profile
there
was
also
a
nice
bit
of
tangy
hops
at
the
very
end
of
the
sip
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
smooth
i
can
see
why
this
would
be
an
everyday
beer
in
belgium
it
is
very
drinkable
and
pairs
well
with
food
or
can
easily
stand
alone
as
a
beer
to
enjoy
nice
to
see
palm
getting
into
this
market
and
at
6
for
a
glass
that
easily
competes
with
me
for
attention
while
out
drinking
pours
a
beautiful
clear
golden
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
fairly
persistent
snowwhite
head
aroma
is
strong
and
mainly
fruity
with
a
malty
undertone
and
a
hint
of
hops
crisp
flavor
is
malty
and
just
a
little
fruity
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
and
finish
has
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
dnice
and
pleasant
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
overall
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
its
not
bad
but
its
also
certainly
not
worth
seeking
out
do
im
a
fan
of
helles
lagers
and
this
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
version
of
those
beers
its
nothing
earth
shattering
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
probably
polish
off
a
sixer
of
it
rather
easily
a
great
warmhot
weather
beer
ill
probably
purchase
another
sixpack
of
this
before
the
summer
done
cheers
i
would
try
it
again
in
case
it
was
a
bad
batch
but
after
that
not
unless
there
was
significant
improvement
got
a
six
pack
of
this
came
in
a
cardboard
box
the
label
i
have
looks
similar
but
reads
belgiums
amber
beer
instead
of
special
it
pours
out
rather
nice
looking
light
amber
with
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
average
however
the
flavor
was
highly
metallic
i
have
had
this
problem
with
other
belgium
brews
stella
too
bad
i
was
more
hopeful
this
would
be
nice
but
it
was
not
at
all
d
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
since
it
had
a
lot
of
mild
flavors
coming
together
and
making
it
quite
drinkable
far
from
horrible
but
pretty
underwhelming
for
the
more
experienced
beer
drinkers
better
as
it
warms
for
sure
will
not
revisit
d
a
very
average
beer
nothing
really
interesting
and
it
doesnt
scream
belgian
tasting
it
blind
i
dont
know
that
id
would
think
it
was
belgian
pretty
standard
amber
beer
i
like
this
kind
of
a
thick
malty
beer
even
though
its
out
of
profile
for
what
one
would
expect
from
a
belgian
ale
malt
is
prominent
and
a
welcome
a
satisfying
approachable
ale
ill
be
back
for
more
mouthfeel
d
palm
is
a
simple
brew
lacking
many
of
the
rich
complexities
of
most
belgians
it
is
however
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
overall
this
one
could
have
been
substituted
with
water
for
accompanying
a
meal
on
its
own
before
food
arrived
it
really
didnt
have
much
going
for
it
more
intensity
in
the
flavor
would
have
helped
this
was
the
featured
beer
on
tap
ill
never
have
this
again

shows

copper
color

decent
offwhite

on

and

nice

nose
picks
up
a
mild
wheat
and
nutty
clove
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
just
a
touch
of
citruspine
hop

flavor
offers
a
smooth
almond
malt
with
bright
lemongrass
hop
it
has
plenty
of

carbonation
with
a
medium
body
plus
feel
its
mostly
grassy

with

nice
neutralizing

enjoyable

nice

served
up
a
wonderful
deep
amber
with
magnificent
parchment
head
that
climbed
up
the
sides
of
the
goblet
and
left
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
was
very
malty
with
caramel
biscuit
and
some
toastyness
as
well
as
a
light
herbal
hop
bouquet
the
flavor
was
quite
nice

not
a
bit
bland
malty
caramel
and
toffee
balanced
against
a
firm
bitterness
and
some
floral
grassy
hops
spice
and
fruity
esters
seem
to
be
nearly
absent
though
mild
it
is
well
balanced
and
a
great
beer
to
have
with
food
the
body
was
medium
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
quaffable
and
tasty
but
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
it
was
the
perfect
beer
to
cap
off
a
long
day
traipsing
around
manhattan
high
drinkability
as
this
goes
down
very
easy
but
the
flavor
is
not
very
exciting
at
all
the
kind
of
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
because
it
was
good
but
just
so
average
that
it
was
a
let
down
i
will
drink
this
again
since
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
d
limited
drinkability
and
limited
appeal
one
would
definitely
be
my
limit
here
and
i
struggled
even
with
that
comes
off
as
a
macro
attempt
at
a
craft
beer
rather
a
true
belgian
this
is
what
i
would
consider
the
bmc
of
belgium
i
would
pass
on
this
a
perfect
example
of
mediocrity
all
around
d
quite
drinkable
but
far
from
extraordinary
bright
and
clear
deep
gold
to
amber
in
color
big
thick
bright
white
foamy
head
not
much
comes
through
in
the
smell
pretty
bland
very
nice
crisp
and
balanced
flavors
slightly
fruity
and
citric
mixed
with
a
clean
bitter
hoppy
finish
a
good
malty
base
holds
everything
together
nicely
this
is
a
very
likable
beer
belgian
beers
intimidate
me
a
little
because
of
all
the
different
exotic
ways
they
can
go
this
is
just
a
very
nice
simple
tasting
beer
simple
in
a
good
way
i
call
it
beer
flavored
beer
i
like
it
ive
edited
this
review
to
increase
the
scores
after
having
the
canned
version
there
seems
to
be
more
flavour
and
more
aroma
when
this
beer
comes
from
a
can
it
probably
deserves
this
higher
score
for
the
ontap
version
too
strange
that
it
always
seems
to
me
a
little
less
impressive
in
the
bottle
good
mouthfeel
tastes
a
bit
dry
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
especial
with
hot
summer
nights
this
may
be
a
macro
beer
but
it
does
a
lot
more
for
me
than
what
stella
artois
hoegaarden
or
leffe
do
drinkability
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
but
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
nose
very
malty
fruity
as
well
probably
the
orange
curacao
there
is
also
a
touch
of
honey
which
shall
end
glass
on
the
palate
is
highly
aromatic
hops
and
yeast
provides
citrus
flavors
finish
fairly
dry
a
little
taste
of
hops
and
lager
in
the
aftertaste
beer
very
sweet
and
refreshing
its
all
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
frothy
white
head
that
is
quite
thick
the
aroma
exudes
grainy
hops
flavor
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
balanced
by
a
sour
bitter
finish
a
bit
of
pear
and
other
fruits
are
present
but
not
with
any
real
strength
mouthfeel
is
thin
like
a
massproduced
ale
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
anything
to
truly
draw
you
in
this
is
a
euro
macro
but
a
nice
one
worth
a
taste
at
8
for
a
tulip
glass
full
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
it
looked
appealing
when
it
was
served
with
its
amber
color
and
creamy
two
finger
head
however
it
all
kinda
went
downhill
from
there
the
smell
was
nothing
special
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
barely
smell
anything
not
much
character
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
with
medium
carbonation
taste
was
quite
boring
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
finish
and
an
almost
cheeselike
aftertaste
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
belgian
pale
i
liked
the
way
the
fruit
and
the
belgian
spices
mixed
very
light
i
could
have
two
or
three
i
got
through
the
glass
and
then
immediately
switched
back
to
the
brooklyn
lager
i
can
live
with
that
the
taste
is
pleasant
if
underwhelming
the
taste
changes
noticeably
with
warmth
malt
is
very
prominent
with
caramel
a
sticky
mouthfeel
with
significant
carbonation
light
amber
one
finger
white
head
quick
dissipation
good
lacing
the
citrusy
ester
yeast
dominates
the
nose
with
a
subtle
hop
presence
on
the
back
end
taste
is
pretty
citrusy
minimal
hops
sweet
malts
with
a
dry
finish
decent
carbonation
a
nice
session
ale
but
nothing
special
d
a
nicely
blnded
beer
that
is
low
in
alcohol
tasty
goes
down
easily
and
that
one
could
sit
with
for
a
night
update
31911
had
ontap
a
couple
times
since
not
grainy
or
rough
more
of
a
fruity
flavored
beer
i
bet
that
heroes
was
hanging
onto
the
keg
for
too
long
when
i
first
tried
it
and
the
presumably
fresher
kegs
since
have
shown
this
beers
true
profile
d
this
could
be
considered
a
session
beer
but
after
awhile
getting
past
the
smell
could
be
difficult
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
not
too
complex
this
beer
doesnt
cause
a
taste
explosion
in
the
mouth
but
has
a
well
balanced
taste
recommendable
to
start
a
drinking
evening
in
the
pub
or
just
together
with
a
dinner
d
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
ill
drink
again
d
ill
finish
my
glass
but
this
wont
be
on
my
shopping
list
next
time
around
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
also
mild
a
tad
bitter
not
a
lot
of
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
offering
very
nice
gateway
beer
a
decent
amber
color
beer
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
but
a
bit
of
a
disapointment
if
you
want
something
more
belgian
in
character
this
beer
has
good
amber
color
a
pale
ale
aroma
and
can
be
quite
drinkable
but
you
dont
get
the
belgian
quality
you
expect
from
this
style
this
peer
pours
a
crustal
clear
golden
color
with
a
barely
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
of
lace
without
much
adherence
to
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
a
bit
of
yeastiness
pale
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
again
just
the
pale
malt
yeast
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
light
mouthfeel
and
good
co2
make
this
an
easy
drinker
as
is
attested
to
by
the
condensation
on
the
empty
glass
a
mild
wellbalanced
amber
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
scent
with
hints
of
low
lovibond
crystal
malts
as
well
the
yeast
esters
are
quite
low
and
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
dry
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
plain
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
super
dry
finish
the
esters
are
again
subtle
with
little
to
no
fruit
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbnonation
this
is
an
average
belgian
ale
theres
nothing
too
exceptional
going
on
here
just
a
solid
well
balanced
beer
excellent
for
sipping
in
an
outdoor
cafe
and
goes
well
with
spicy
or
ethnic
foods

out
there
i
highly

i
would
ever
go
for
one
of
these

smell
is
not
impressive
taste
is
mild
and
malty
a

this
is

with
a
short
ring
of
white
bubbles
decent

nose
some
apple
and
dry
hops
give
it
a
floral
feel
taste
is
flat
watery
biscuity
malt
with
a
fruity
malt
companion
couldnt
tell
if
the
metallic
bitterness
was
from
the
hops
or
possibly
crystal
malt
either
way
it
was
flat
coincidentally
the
beer
was
not
it
was
very
carbonated
overall
this
tasted
like
a
watereddown
macro
version
of
a
belgian
pale
where
you
would
expect
hops
on
the
finish
this
beer
gives
dark
fruits
which
i
think
it
due
to
the
yeast
character
interesting
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
good
enough
to
recommend
over
a
delerium
tripel
say
i
suppose
that
all
those
years
of
drinking
duvel
and
chimay
and
rochefort
have
spoiled
me
i
tend
to
expect
alot
of
insanely
complex
fruit
and
spice
in
my
belgians
palm
doesnt
have
that
in
fact
it
has
more
in
common
with
a
british
pale
ale
than
it
does
with
its
bolder
belgian
brethren
that
said
it
is
a
wellbrewed
beer
which
lends
itself
to
drinking
with
dinner
pretty
good
stuff
drinkability
this
is
an
ease
to
drink
beer
almost
like
a
lager
to
menothing
special
but
worth
a
try
d
extremely
drinkable
with
low
alcohol
making
it
even
easier
to
drink
alot
palm
tasted
kind
of
bland
to
me
fresh
off
the
tap
but
10
or
so
minutes
in
the
flavor
just
came
together
making
me
smile
a
good
belgian
pale
ale
of
which
there
are
alot
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
belgian
ambers
out
there
drinkability
i
found
this
one
ok
for
drinkability
and
could
easily
have
had
a
couple
more
it
also
paired
well
with
the
spicy
shrimp
dish
that
was
lunch
however
that
being
said
id
probably
not
make
any
special
effort
to
seek
it
out
to
have
again
color
me
unimpressed
had
a
glass
while
watching
gentwevelgem
in
ghent
this
was
a
thin
but
drinkable
belgian
pale
ale
with
less
flavor
than
usual
for
the
massproduced
belgianstyle
ales
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
but
alas
watery
white
bread
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
belgian
spice
not
worth
trying
but
not
a
horrible
option
9
in
a
branded
tulip
glass
at
the
brass
monkey
in

not
impressed
with
this
one
thought
it
was
a
little
flat
couldve
been
the
tap
thin
head
no
lacing
microcarbonation
tasted
very
biscuity
and
a
little
cloying

clear

the

with
moderate

some

hints

not
too
bad
but
palm
dobbel
was
more
to
my
liking
m
smooth
and
creamy
medium

ale
carbonation
level
is
higher
than
normal
wtf
is
this
crap
mouthfeeldrinkability
alive
and
crackly
this
beers
texture
is
really
quite
fantastic
while
the
pinsize
carbonation
sizzles
the
tongue
it
also
immediately
pulls
back
and
rides
like
foam
in
just
seconds
if
there
were
more
complex
interesting
flavors
going
on
here
this
stage
would
be
set
for
a
wonderful
exhibition
not
a
bad
beer
overall
just
unmemorable
and
pedestrian
pours
a
light
copper
with
dense
fluffy
head
and
light
lacing
the
smell
is
strange
almost
beefy
like
a
grilled
steak
the
flavor
is
light
malty
and
biscuity
a
whiff
of
slightly
sour
floral
hops
with
a
little
sweetness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
insubstantial
the
beer
is
ok
sessionable
perhaps
but
its
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
weird
smell
and
a
slight
sour
unpleasant
aftertaste
bought
this
on
a
whim
and
i
loved
it
a
perfect
session
beer
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
my
lasagna
more
light
bodied
than
heavy
bodied
and
well
balanced
it
has
a
nice
kick
to
it
and
goes
down
smooth
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
out
of
nowhere
much
better
than
any
other
generic
import
out
there
this
brew
poured
a
lt
froffy
tan
head
with
good
lacing
i
got
tropical
fruit
and
roasted
chesnuts
this
ale
looks
great
in
the
glassit
has
a
nice
blood
orange
color
and
a
nonstop
flow
of
tiny
bubbles
the
taste
has
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
that
quickly
fades
into
a
spicy
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
med
body
and
leaves
a
soft
baked
grain
aftertaste
the
drinkabilty
has
a
high
score
due
to
the
fact
this
ale
is
only
5
1
abv
and
this
pale
ale
is
well
balanced
and
mighty
tasty
notes
very
good
beer
sessions
are
o
k
with
this
one
drinkability
an
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
pale
ale
easily
drinkable
this
was
hard
for
me
to
slow
down
a
good
session
beer
highly
drinkable
beer
not
your
usual
belgian
beer
more
english
or
american
in
style
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
transparent
orange
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
wispy
white
head
that
leaves
some
sticking
some
funk
not
farmhouse
funk
but
bottlemachine
funk
in
the
nose
other
notes
include
standard
lager
malt
and
grassy
euro
lager
bittering
hops
fruity
malts
arrive
upfront
first
moving
into
a
crisp
but
mild
and
balancing
bitterness
again
the
funk
comes
in
just
after
the
dry
finish
and
lingers
long
on
to
the
aftertaste
light
bodied
and
extremely
drinkable
i
had
this
with
lunch
at
a
cafe
in
amsterdam
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
palm
glass
the
beer
was
clear
and
copper
colored
with
a
sweet
malty
aroma
the
taste
was
more
malty
than
hopped
kind
of
caramel
sweet
it
tasted
like
a
maibock
with
a
little
light
fruit
very
refreshing
and
perfect
with
lunch
overall
this
is
not
the
most
complex
belgian
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
quite
nice
it
may
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
though
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
things
that
would
take
priority
for
me
d
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
this
used
to
be
my
daily
beer
i
prefer
it
out
of
the
bottle
as
to
on
tap
very
easy
to
drink
fruity
caramel
flavors
that
dont
linger
for
too
long
when
poored
into
the
older
style
goblets
its
easy
to
get
a
really
nice
thick
head
on
the
beer
very
common
beer
in
belgium
most
of
any
bar
you
walk
into
will
cary
it
so
it
is
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
certainly
worth
a
try
it
is
sold
in
cans
also
but
i
only
drink
it
like
this
out
of
desperation
customs
seems
to
let
cans
of
beer
slide
when
they
are
in
international
post
packages
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
this
evening
once
and
for
all
in
patchogue
this
beer
poured
amber
slightly
carbonated
with
a
white
head
the
smell
was
one
a
belgian
ale
i
am
not
totally
educated
on
belgian
beers
so
i
can
not
always
place
the
smells
the
taste
was
nice
nicely
malted
but
imo
a
run
of
the
mill
belgian
nothing
compared
to
the
chimay
tripel
i
tried
before
it
this
beer
feels
nice
in
my
mouth
not
exactally
something
i
would
drink
all
night
but
it
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
an
orange
dark
amber
color
with
light
bubbly
white
foam
head
that
reduced
slowly
and
left
some
spotty
lacing
mellow
grassy
smell
and
malts
on
the
nose
tasted
of
malts
caramel
and
sweet
spicy
hops
was
very
easy
drinking
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
crisp
finish
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
good
mouthfeel
although
it
couldve
been
a
little
thicker
along
with
a
good
level
of
drinkability
due
to
the
modest
5
1
abv
this
beer
was
served
to
me
on
draft
in
a
goblet
style
glass
it
had
a
light
tan
color
with
a
very
soft
aroma
it
had
a
very
light
clean
aftertaste
i
would
consider
this
to
be
a
rather
social
beer
very
light
head
retention
this
beer
did
not
taste
strong
or
hoppy
at
all
my
first
impression
of
this
beer
was
massproduced
euro
amber
beer
i
dont
know
much
about
palm
but
being
from
belgium
i
expected
a
bit
more
theres
a
sweet
breadcorn
flavor
that
is
a
bit
jarring
as
the
beer
warms
some
of
the
subtleties
with
spices
become
present
but
its
too
little
too
late
for
my
taste
overall
a
sub
par
belgian
amber
i
would
skip
this
one
d
not
overly
complex
in
the
flavour
and
the
mouthfeel
gives
good
drinkability
nice
but
easily
forgettable
d
this
is
an
ok
belgian
beer
far
from
anything
special
but
easy
to
drink
and
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
i
wont
be
rushing
back
to
the
store
to
pick
up
some
more
d

for

glass
from
three
sisters
pub
amsterdam
nl
tastes
fresh
but
not
as
fresh
as
the
offthetap
steam
beer
at
brewerkz
ive
travelled
there
3
times
now
and
have
had
palm
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
its
better
than
a
lot
of
alternatives
d
very
crispness
helps
motivate
the
palate
for
some
more
a
session
belgian
one
of
my
wifes
favourite
beers
i
like
it
too
multiple
cups
at
the
palm
open
house
in
steenhuffel
on
91006
overall
an
excellent
and
very
quaffable
ale
nothing
groundbreaking
but
certainly
recommended
the
beer
is
a
good
cheap
purchase
in
benelux
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
other
belgians
with
more
character
i
dont
think
id
be
up
for
drinking
this
one
nonstop
all
night
but
it
sure
is
nice
for
a
few
bottles
worth
maybe
i
can
try
to
find
this
stuff
ontap
while
im
here
quite
drinkable
and
a
overal
pleasant
brew
this
is
a
bit
like
a
bass
without
that
burton
taste
non
offensive
easily
drunk
not
bad
d
overall
a
good
beer
even
for
a
macro
brew
i
would
not
choose
to
drink
this
one
after
a
nice
dinner
however
to
quench
my
thirst
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
its
a
great
choice
handsome
dark
amber
colour
moderate
head
pleasant
gentle

some

beerlover
swett
and
lightly
roasted
aftertaste
with
some
bitterness
well
balanced
even
a
fruity
note
and
a
light
vanilla
had
on
tap
at
a
hotel
i
stayed
in
in
nijkerk
netherlands
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
ordered
i
just
saw
the
offering
for
palm
special
and
knew
i
hadnt
had
it
before
this
beer
was
served
in
a
palm
branded
brandy
snifter
style
glass
the
amber
liquid
came
topped
with
12
inch
of
thick
white
head
which
died
down
in
the
center
it
was
sticky
and
stayed
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
i
was
drinking
the
low
malty
aroma
carried
over
into
the
taste
which
to
me
seemed
to
be
of
refined
grainyness
more
maltyness
than
hops
i
enjoyed
the
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
new
to
the
bc
liqour
stores
this
beer
looks
belgian
but
smells
and
tastes
scottish
the
nose
wafts
malts
and
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
big
malts
with
with
a
nice
hop
balance
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
session
beer
and
food
friendly
to
boot
not
a
classic
but
rather
an
interesting
take
on
a
scottish
ale
through
a
rather
convoluted
set
of
circumstances
managed
to
get
a
bottle
brought
back
after
a
native
of
belgium
made
a
visit
home
i
think
this
is
my
first
belgian
beer
that
was
not
what
i
typically
think
of
as
belgian
in
character
i
e
characteristic
yeast
flavors
to
me
this
hit
me
as
esbish
and
was
quite
good
nice
bold
hops
with
sturdy
toffee
malt
marching
along
in
step
lively
carbonation
very
drinkable
slight
nose
of
sweet
caramel
slight
amber
look
in
the
goblet
with
a
sticky
white
lasting
head
that
settles
to
a
sheen
the
brew
is
sweet
to
the
tongue
very
flat
tasting
and
one
dimentional
medium
feel
on
the
palet
with
some
carbonation
on
the
tongue
clean
finish
an
ok
beer
but
it
did
not
impress
me
enough
to
want
to
seek
it
out
in
the
future
but
it
is
a
beer
with
more
taste
than
coors
and
a
beer
i
could
drink
alot
of
it
has
a
weak
smell
too
it
smells
a
little
of
bread
this
is
not
a
beer
i
have
seen
in
sweden
but
when
i
see
a
bottle
again
i
will
buy
it
overall
impression
an
averagetogood
beer
it
falls
in
line
with
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
but
in
my
opinion
de
koninck
is
the
star
in
that
genre
drinkability
all
night
long
i
could
throw
down
12
of
these
no
problem
course
theyre
only
quarterliter
bottles
hehheh
but
this
is
a

overall
a
nice
mix
of
flavor
done
well
very
enjoyable
had
a
bottle
from
2011
that
was
still
in
excellent
condition
this
beer
is
not
an
assault
on
the
senses
it
is
rather
a
gentle
complex
composition
of
belgian
yeasts
spices
and
barnyard
aromas
would
drink
this
again
any
time
if
it
was
more
accessible

not

very

though
it
would
have
been
great
for
the
summer
but
this
bottle
stamped
314
just
made
it
to
local
shelves
this
is
a
great
beer
though
not
the
best
example
of
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
the
reason
i
think
this
beer
stands
out
is
that
it
has
all
the
positive
elements
of
a
sour
and
pale
ale
but
with
none
of
the
negatives
had
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
massive
head
and
intense
lacing
flavor
was
unique
grains
of
paradise
and
passion
fruit
not
much
hoppiness
for
a
pale
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
theyre
going
for
here

fairly
dry
every
jolly

me
in

no

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
little
belgian
pale
ale
like
to
me
and
i
think
its
a
good
example
of
a
lightly
funky
and
pretty
drinkable
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
think
the
spices
added
that
much
to
this
beer
but
they
certainly
didnt
take
anything
away
from
it
this
beer
had
pretty
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
dry
on
the
finish
not
filling
slightly
refreshing
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
this
is
a
nice
bottle
to
split
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
any
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
especially
on
a
warm
day
in
the
summer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
nothing
was
too
overpowering
with
this
beer
and
it
seemed
like
all
aspects
were
kept
in
check
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
spices
didnt
come
through
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
citrus
in
the
flavor
wouldnt
hurt
either
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
at
over
13
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
so
i
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
it
that
often
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
sessionable
funky
beers
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
like
it
a
little
more
than
i
did
when
i
first
tried
it
it
went
down
pretty
easy
on
a
warm
first
day
of
june
its
not
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
or
sessionable
funky
beer
but
its
pretty
good
in
its
one
right
and
i
enjoyed
it
good
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
keep
up
the
great
work
o
i
am
very
spoiled
living
next
to
jester
king
brewery
with
their
excellent
sour
and
tart
flavor
profiles
my
expectations
may
be
too
high
although
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
and
reviewing
the
remaining
jolly
pumpkin
thats
why
i
bought
several
as
i
am
sure
there
are
one
or
two
that
will
be
even
better
id
say
this
is
more
of
a
session
style
beer
similar
to
the
le
petite
france
at
jester
king
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
a
try
but
the
sourness
gets
lost
o
a
very
drinkable
complex
refreshing
and
overall
satisfying
beer
gentle
enough
to
finish
a
750
ml
no
problem
and
complex
enough
to
fully
saver
without
requiring
a
12
abv
monster
this
and
most
all
jp
brews
is
art
in
brewing
at
its
finest
ron
jeffries
is
a
god
overall
really
good
stuff
like
a
hybrid
between
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
sour
every
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewer
has
been
a
winner
so
far
taste
is
sweetish
fruity
but
mostly
funky
tart
and
puffy
so
amazing
absolutetly
love
jolly
pumpkin
this
brew
does
not
dissapoint
at
all
in
line
with
their
quality
unlike
the
post
below
this
brew
is
fantast
wait
for
it
ic
overall
this
beer
just
doesnt
justify
the
cost
or
the
effort
pretty
bland
and
weak
flavors
way
too
expensive
and
not
nearly
where
a
jolly
pumpkin
should
be
crisp
and
refreshing
a
little
sweet
but
not
overpowering
im
not
typically
one
to
enjoy
a
belgian
pale
ale
and
this
one
is
one
id
definitely
have
again
pours
a
typical
golden
color
and
carbonation
is
light
and
very
pleasing
it
seems
jolly
pumpkin
can
do
no
wrong
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
the
further
into
the
bottle
i
got
it
is
very
complex
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
a
sour
saison
definitely
not
for
everybody
but
if
youre
interested
in
the
aforementioned
styles
give
it
a
try
overall
another
winner
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
so
it
was
not
until
i
got
this
beer
home
and
was
cracking
it
open
that
i
realized
that
there
was
a
sticker
on
the
back
that
indicated
bottled
06272012
i
know
this
beer
comes
out
in
june
but
two
junes
ago
ruh
roh
can
a
6
5
alcohol
beer
survive
15
months
well
i
bought
this
beer
from
the
refrigerated
beer
section
at
whole
foods
and
i
think
the
proper
storage
environment
has
treated
this
beverage
well
im
guessing
the
bottle
conditioning
chipped
in
as
well
i
actually
really
like
it
to
me
it
tastes
a
little
more
like
a
saison
than
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
its
on
the
darker
side
and
maybe
not
quite
as
dry
very
nice
45
odpretty
neat
another
one
if
those
beers
that
i
was
happy
to
sample
without
having
to
shell
out
a
bunch
of
dough
for
one
of
their
bottles
bottle
from
the
shop
pours
a
beautiful
clear
golden
with
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
fruity
brett
apples
pears
citrus
lemon
peel
dry
oak
and
some
spice
flavor
is
bretty
to
the
core
sour
apples
sweet
pears
orange
peel
and
a
nice
bitter
dry
crisp
finish
light
on
the
palate
and
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
carbonation
nice
summer
beer
which
pushes
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
more
than
pale
ale
style
the
feel
is
big
expansive
champagne
like
and
dry
quite
bold
in
the
mouth
it
sets
itself
apart
from
other
beers
o
another
fine
ale
from
jp
a
good
beer
for
warm
weather
i
tend
to
prefer
less
hops
but
this
certainly
has
its
place
i
highly
recommend
this
ale
to
sour
fans
especially
if
you
like
hop
forward
ales
i
loved
the
chance
to
try
this
on
tap
this
could
certainly
be
a
session
sour
the
firefly
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
huge
lacing
and
fluffy
head
there
is
a
strong
spicy
aroma
with
strong
hints
of
belgian
candies
taste
is
the
same
strong
lots
of
spices
and
lots
of
belgian
candy
flavors
but
a
mess
with
the
sweetness
way
way
way
too
sweet
nice
carbonation
good
body
but
so
sweet
overall
i
found
it
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
or
tried
to
consumed
for
that
matter
i
am
rather
convinced
i
must
have
picked
up
a
bad
bottle
o
i
found
the
nose
and
flavor
to
be
very
different
and
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
sweetness
on
the
palate
there
is
a
lot
of
tasty
sourness
and
barnyard
funk
though
and
still
quite
enjoyable
just
a
bit
dry
for
me
o
i
thought
this
was
pretty
tasty
however
i
didnt
think
it
was
worth
the
8
i
paid
for
it
nothing
stood
out
as
an
unbelievable
beer
the
funk
was
the
only
thing
that
set
it
apart
from
anything
else
like
it
and
that
was
subdued
o
this
is
one
thrist
quenching
yet
satisfying
beer
that
with
some
time
on
it
has
perhaps
helped
dry
this
out
a
bit
and
let
the
yeast
do
its
thing
ooverall
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
the
alcohol
for
me
is
minimal
which
adds
to
the
overall
drinkability
of
the
beer
jolly
pumpkin
is
turning
out
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
due
to
their
unique
beers
and
their
execution
of
them
buy
one
drink
it
enjoy
o
the
aroma
is
great
on
this
great
balance
complexity
intensity
the
flavor
has
an
odd
off
flavor
that
i
assume
is
from
the
yeast
its
tough
to
describe
but
it
certainly
takes
the
beer
down
a
few
notches
another
winner
from
jolly
pumpkin
maybe
im
a
homer
and
possibly
just
a
bit
biased
since
im
from
michigan
and
we
presently
dont
have
an
abundance
of
farmhouse
style
brewers
but
jolly
pumpkin
knows
how
to
work
those
belgian
style
ales
extremely
well
i
think
this
beer
is
totally
underrated
a
super
refreshing
ale
that
would
go
great
with
a
muggy
latesummer
evening
overall
i
found
this
to
be
another
good
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
that
did
not
have
any
factor
to
really
push
it
over
the
top
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
intensity
the
result
is
a
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
fizzy
prickly
at
first
but
which
quickly
changes
to
a
foamy
smooth
and
full
mouthfeel
closes
quite
dry
with
modest
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
d
a
solid
brew
and
good
example
of
style
excellent
sessionability
d
very
nicely
balanced
bpa
overall
this
was
a
rather
interesting
brew
although
not
one
i
would
likely
go
back
to
again
as
the
brew
warmed
over
time
it
seemed
to
lose
much
of
the
hop
flavor
that
was
present
at
the
end
of
the
taste
replacing
it
with
a
more
puckering
sour
taste
a
decent
one
to
try
and
best
to
drink
cold
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
whose
genius
lies
in
its
simplicity
and
ability
to
fuse
all
its
individual
parts
into
one
easy
to
drink
yet
very
tasty

a

beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
us
made
belgian
style
brewers
and
i
feel
it
gets
the
job
done
with
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
overall
i
have
to
say
this
is
quite
average
hype
is
hype
and
it
is
what
it
is
i
traded
my
bam
bier
after
this
a
very
overrated
brew
quite
honestly
very
nice
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
these
are
beers
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
always
have
in
my
fridge
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
bright
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
there
is
certainly
sour
in
the
nose
along
with
some
wet
hay
ad
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
the
tartness
isnt
as
pronounced
on
the
tongue
but
the
brett
comes
through
with
a
little
dampness
although
its
cut
with
some
mildly
astringent
urine
flavors
weirdly
not
really
a
bad
thing
that
give
this
beer
some
urgency
some
malt
lingers
through
the
finish
subdued
thinnish
mouthfeel
but
nice
depth
overall
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
very
refreshing
and
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
perhaps
a
bit
exotic
for
the
style
but
intriguing
and
quaffable
nonetheless
id
love
to
have
this
beer
again
overall
very
interesting
and
recommended
might
be
better
fresh
though
its
unclear
what
two
years
has
done
to
this
the
firefly
has
a
hazy
bronze
appearance
with
some
gold
trimmings
a
whisp
of
off
white
foam
on
top
that
has
pretty
good
legs
leaving
some
minor
spots
on
the
glass
looks
a
shade
darker
than
the
standard
belgian
pale
ale
smell
is
fruity
a
lot
of
esters
bready
yeast
and
some
earthy
hop
aroma
i
get
a
nice
sniff
of
apple
skins
with
traces
of
orange
not
sure
if
this
is
aged
in
any
sort
of
barrel
but
some
wood
accompanies
the
pale
ale
some
floral
aspect
fruity
in
the
middle
with
apple
orange
and
coriander
a
bready
finish
with
yeast
pretty
light
bodied
not
as
spritzy
in
the
mouth
as
other
belgian
pales
this
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
crisper
but
im
just
nitpicking
a
glass
of
this
is
ok
for
me
a
whole
bottle
would
be
better
shared
overall
this
ale
is
stunningly
adept
and
authentically
astute
id
be
a
damn
fool
to
ever
turn
this
down
wheneverwherever
it
may
present
itself
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
pour
and
just
explore
the
different
flavors
textures
and
strange
characteristics
of
what
wild
yeast
can
do
to
a
beer
good
citrus
and
tropical
flavors
a
slightly
tart
and
sweet
character
while
the
basement
funk
is
subtle
and
bold
at
the
same
time
good
stuff
here
reminds
me
of
an
orval
redux
super
drinkability
a
very
approachable
sour
ale
i
think
i
need
to
revisit
some
of
there
beer
i
believe
my
tastebuds
today
appreciate
these
offerings
more
than
a
few
years
ago

the

definitely
a
touch

huge
fan
of
jolly

and
this
is
this
is
no
exception
complex
and
well
blended
i
love
the
fact
that
all
jp
brews
are
similar
but
very
different
depending
on
the
style
this
one
didnt
last
long
overall
another
great
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
not
the
most
complex
of
their
lineup
but
one
of
the
brightest
and
easiest
to
enjoy
a
very
wellrendered
bpa
all
inputs
used
in
equally
deft
measures
giving
us
a
fullflavoured
version

an
all

often
underwhelming

refreshing

exactly
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
golden
yellow
in
color
and
very
well
filtered
a
small
amount
of
lacing
in
the
glass
wall
as
with
most
jolly
pumpkin
beers
there
is
a
very
forward
sour
smell
and
taste
in
this
one
i
get
some
kumquat
and
tangerine
almost
a
seedy
flavor
from
those
fruits
on
the
back
end
this
beer
really
seems
to
be
a
wit
or
hefe
but
i
guess
it
isnt
overall
a
little
underwhelmed
at
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
especially
considering
the
price
m
medium
bodied
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
dry
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
another
nicely
done
beer
from
jp
its
expensive
but
they
rarely
miss
the
mark
o
much
like
every
other
jolly
pumpkin
ale
la
luciernaga
is
very
interesting
and
surprisingly
drinkable
its
not
as
complex
as
some
of
their
other
brews
but
it
makes
up
for
this
minor
flaw
by
being
superbly
balanced
all
in
all
id
say
this
is
one
of
their
best
efforts
o
oro
is
better
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
anothergreat
beer
by
jolly
pumpkin
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
and
very
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
a
billowing
three
finger
bright
white
soapy
head
the
nose
is
right
up
my
alley
kind
of
like
a
barrel
aged
saison
its
light
and
features
a
slight
amount
of
citrus
with
a
mellow
yeast
character
with
soft
oaking
and
traditional
belgain
pale
malt
i
love
the
citrus
its
both
lemony
and
has
a
nice
tangerine
side
to
it
the
flavors
are
nice
and
light
the
citrus
character
is
the
first
thing
you
notice
followed
by
how
soft
everything
is
the
oak
is
perfect
it
really
does
drink
like
a
light
barrel
aged
saison
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
impressive
jolly
pumpkins
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
yet
also
velvety
smooth
this
beer
is
top
notch
and
definitely
worth
your
while
o
this
has
been
a
want
of
mine
for
a
while
despite
having
jp
available
to
me
this
particular
beer
has
eluded
me
up
to
this
point
i
happened
upon
it
in
a
small
beer
store
covered
in
dust
there
is
very
little
hop
presence
but
great
fruit
tart
and
funk
it
is
no
longer
a
typical
bpa
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
a
funky
aroma
mixed
with
some
lemon
oak
and
pepper
flavor
followed
suit
a
nice
kinda
creamy
medium
body
with
some
acitivity
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
one
i
would
gladly
drink
again
though
probably
not
one
i
would
spend
over
10
for
via
a
bomber
id
probably
be
more
likely
to
check
out
if
offered
via
a
4
pack6
pack
o
a
solid
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
a
nicely
refreshing
beer
that
distinguishes
itself
in
a
welcome
way
from
the
style
i
found
it
just
the
trick
to
help
recover
from
a
hard
days
work
in
the
yard
lovely
crisp
tart
refreshing
wild
ale
with
a
real
naturalistic
bent
but
all
the
weird
funkiness
has
been
tamed
and
distilled
into
a
finely
balanced
chrysalis
of
flavour
overall
another
very
solid
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
unfortunately
i
feel
as
though
i
now
have
astronomical
expectations
for
each
new
beer
of
theirs
i
try
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
but
i
always
expect
a
world
class
one
o
nice
sour
belgian
pale
if
this
had
slightly
more
cherryfruit
flavor
it
would
be
almost
perfect
for
me
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
woody
notes
as
well
taste
is
mildly
tart
and
funky
with
some
grain
spice
and
woody
flavors
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
not
quite
as
edgy
as
some
of
the
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
in
the
past
probably
my
favorite
jp
brew
thus
far
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
really
nice
funky
belgian
style
pale
that
has
good
fruit
and
slightly
spice
oak
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
could
go
for
a
few
glasses
o
my
wife
and
i
both
like
this
brew
and
that
doesnt
always
happen
very
good
stuff
o
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
the
jp
house
flavors
are
present
and
to
me
this
tastes
very
similar
to
the
bam
biere
thats
been
aged
thats
not
a
bad
thing
but
it
would
be
nice
to
get
more
of
the
spice
flavors
mentioned
on
the
bottle
shining
through
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
snifter

a
slightly
hazy
orange

frothy

this
quickly
recedes
to

of
lemons
with
some
bready
malts
and
a
good
amount

funk
t
spicy
and
tart
up

with
a
definite
sour
note
which
lingers
has
a
definite
acidity
no
hops
presence
some
funk
present
in
the
taste
as
well
m
lively
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
a
good
beer
if
youre
into
sours
would
be
a
good
beer
pairing
o
a
very
good
brew
a
definite
must
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
jps
brews
they
always
catch
me
off
guard
if
this
brew
could
be
more
sour
it
would
be
amazing
overall
so
its
good
but
as
ever
it
tastes
like
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
their
yeast
strain
makes
everything
taste
the
same
its
all
good
but
occasionally
id
like
to
be
surprised
by
a
flavor
profile
dank
ass
beer
pours
a
darker
red
shade
with
a
jovial
white
head
smells
like
a
sour
brett
concoction
flavor
is
great
really
sour
brett
up
front
but
more
nuanced
unrolling
with
some
red
licorice
and
caramel
malt
had
a
very
funky
memorable
finish
tart
and
assertive
mouthfeel
is
great
very
very
lively
carbonation
with
a
piquant
conclusion
great
example
of
an
american
wild
beer
way
way
better
than
the
blue
one
and
more
seductive
than
the
red
one
sessionable
tastespicy
yeast
orchard
fruits
some
belgian
funkiness
and
a
definite
sourtartness
that
is
the
trademark
of
jolly
pumpkin
brews
not
a
mindblower
but
a
fine
refreshing
beer
on
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
really
tastes
like
a
hoppy
cider
apple
flavor
really
comes
through
medium
body
somewhat
clean
finish
plenty
of
taste
but
is
definitely
a
bit
tart
which
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
youll
try
but
with
the
expensive
price
tag
and
overly
done
tartness
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
finish
this
bottle
too
quickly
overall
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
many
of
these
often
refreshing
not
punishing
lighter
but
very
complex
a
lot
going
on
definitely
recommend
this
the
prices
are
a
bit
steep
so
these
are
treats
more
than
regular
offerings
taste
and
texture
slightly
on
the
fuller
side
of
mediumbodied
with
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
amidst
complex
flavours
of
apple
cider
mineral
cooked
peaches
and
spice
the
finish
is
slightly
funky
and
dry
much
drier
than
you
would
expect
from
the
mouthfeel
and
flavour
and
spicy
like
it
sure
do
lightbodied
and
refreshing
very
little
malt
essence
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
to
bite
into
although
perhaps
i
would
feel
differently
in
7
months
its
october
right
now
some
nutty
malt
flavor
appears
with
patience
do
i
detect
grains
of
paradise
the
bottle
says
yes
and
coriander
poured
from
a
bottle
into
the
only
clean
cup
in
my
sink
ha
hazy
light
amber
orange
color
i
only
have
fluorescent
lights
in
my
bungalow
so
its
hard
to
tell
sometimes
minimal
head
dissipates
quickly
nice
brett
aroma
not
much
else
in
there
maybe
some
light
spice
hard
to
tell
when
youve
had
this
much
reconstructive
surgery
taste
is
very
nice
funky
mild
brett
sourness
real
clean
and
light
comes
off
like
a
dry
latex
glove
sense
a
little
citrus
and
spice
nice

too
good
solid
jolly
pumpkin
beer
going
to
taco
bell
hope
this
is
still
here
when
i
get
back
all
4s
a
really
enjoyable
beer
moderate
funky
fruity
and
acidic
hit
all
the
highlights
for
this
drinker
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
in
jolly
pumpkin
fashion
drink
and
overall
im
a
homer
so
its
hard
for
me
to
hate
on
any
jp
beer
but
if
i
did
it
wouldnt
start
here
really
nice
expression
the
balance
between
oak
sour
and
lively
body
really
make
this
unique
not
cloying
bright
enjoyable
drinks
like
a
dry
sauv
blanc
a
very
nice
surprisingly
sour
ale
a
decidedly
unique
beer
jolly
pumpkin
always
creates
something
unique
and
this
is
certainly
no
exception
medium
consistency
in
the
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
overall
not
the
most
complex
jp
brew
ive
had
but
an
excellent
effort
as
expected
does
jolly
pumpkin
even
make
a
bad
beer
ive
never
had
one
yet
but
will
keep
searching
and
hoping
for
the
best
get
into
this
beer
o
the
sourness
makes
this
beer
quite
interesting
compared
to
others
in
the
style
i
would
definitely
want
to
try
another
one
of
these
my
wife
and
i
shared
a
glass
of
this
one
yesterday
afternoon
at
hops
pie
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
large
lasting
ivory
head
aromas
of
vanilla
spice
fruitiness
barnyard
leather
and
light
caramel
palate
was
light
bodied
crisp
and
slightly
dry
flavors
of
caramel
coriander
citrus
and
good
barnyard
funk
with
a
crisp
dry
slightly
tart
finish
o
it
was
nice
to
try
something
pretty
different
the
funkiness
overpowered
everything
else
and
sort
of
detracted
from
the
enjoyment
i
like
sourness
but
it
seemed
dominant
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
its
interesting
complex
drinkable
and
not
too
boozy
which
is
an
unfortunately
uncommon
combination
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
really
good
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
so
highly
carbonated
that
it
foams
out
everywhere
when
opening
the
bottle
wasnt
even
touched
until
i
opened
it
o
delicious
beer
with
nice
use
of
hops
earth
and
pleasant
sour
which
adds
nice
contrast
to
bitter
hops
i
have
yet
to
be
unimpressed
by
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
if
you
do
not
like
sour
notes
in
your
pale
ales
or
beers
in
general
do
no
pick
this
one
up
however
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
worth
the
money
overall
on
point
first
experience
with
jpaa
ingredients
are
well
utilized
that
makes
for
a
wellsequenced
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
good
stuff
overall
lightly
sour
and
refreshing
all
around
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
typical
jp
funk
that
i
love
belgian
yeast
sweet
citrus
spice
and
green
apples
taste
is
initially
hoppy
with
some
subtle
floral
notes
tart
green
apple
and
tart
mellon
flavor
nice
yeasty
flavors
with
pleasant
hopiness
mouthfeel
is
light
but
it
doesnt
affect
in
lack
of
flavor
at
all
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
jp
i
would
drink
this
on
the
regular
o
a
great
beer
that
i
wasnt
sure
of
being
over
a
year
past
its
best
by
date
will
try
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
to
compare
but
this
was
great
the
beer
is
hazy
and
yellow
with
a
soft
white
head
the
aroma
brings
spice
funk
citrus
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
the
funk
flavor
emerges
much
more
as
the
beer
warms
citrus
and
spice
add
nice
depth
and
complexity
the
feel
is
thin
bodied
with
a
distinctive
jolly
pumpkin
finish
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
especially
if
you
appreciate
funky
eccentric
beers
paired
this
one
up
with
spiced
lamb
rack
and
apple
relish
this
beer
is
really
nice
the
poured
gives
off
a
orange
copper
color
thin
head
that
faded
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
sour
and
funky
without
a
doubt
the
taste
is
wild
at
first
tart
and
sour
but
mellows
really
really
well
into
a
beautiful
malt
aftertaste
with
some
sour
still
lingering
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
really
nice
bubbly
and
light
overall
the
beer
tasted
really
nice
and
paired
well
with
the
lamb
o
i
can
really
appreciate
this
beer
especially
when
grouped
in
this
style
but
for
me
i
would
really
let
this
one
sit
a
while
the
use
of
fresh
hops
is
kind
of
distracting
with
the
funk
and
spice
going
on
here
this
is
good
but
time
might
push
this
up
a
notch
beer
is
thin
and
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
it
finishes
a
little
dry
with
oak
tannins
and
some
grain
the
forward
is
mildly
sweet
some
pilsen
malt
and
some
lactic
acid
sourness
the
brett
comes
through
nicely
in
this
beer
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
id
have
more
of
it
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
is
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
solid
inch
or
two
of
head
smells
are
funky
and
barnyardish
with
some
hints
of
cloves
and
other
spices
taste
is
slightly
sour
lemon
with
some
mild
spices
this
is
very
light
and
refreshing
with
very
little
in
terms
of
alcohol
presence
o
overall
a
good
beer
the
nose
is
fantastic
and
sour
while
the
taste
falls
back
to
more
conventional
belgian
like
spice
and
yeast
would
definitely
have
it
again
another
nice
sour
from
jp
loaded
with
taste
and
an
abv
that
makes
it
super
drinkable
drinkability
isnt
to
high
probably
my
least
favorite
jp
more
acid
less
spice
yes
as
it
stands
its
serviceable
but
the
price
makes
it
one
i
wont
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
no
surprise
really
that
these
guys
came
through
with
such
a
great
ale
of
this
style
because
they
obviously
know
their
way
around
brett
beers
o
really
good
jp
beer
funky
as
expected
with
some
slight
tart
and
nice
dryness
that
is
quite
refreshing
o
i
had
multiple
offerings
of
this
at
the
party
what
a
great
keg
to
have
around
this
showed
off
the
brett
just
enough
and
provided
a
very
pleasant
finish
ostill
my
favorite
jp
offering
a
tart
spicy
honey
sweet
brew
that
holds
my
interest
through
and
through
easy
to
enjoy
multiples
pints
of
o
i
had
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the
two
days
and
it
really
began
to
grow
on
me
it
had
just
enough
funk
without
being
too
overpowering
m
the
mouthfeel
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
adjust
to
even
though
ive
had
the
beer
many
times
that
tartness
is
jarring
a
refreshing
citric
blast
o
not
the
best
jp
beer
available
but
easy
drinking
and
tasty
the
jp
usual
suspects
are
all
here
great
spicy
yeast
tartness
great
flavor
and
a
simply
high
quality
product
i
really
liked
the
additional
spice
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
flavorful
easy
drinking
and
complex
beer
the
sour
funky
flavor
really
worked
well
for
me
very
nice
overall
6262011
overall
a
good
beer
but
if
im
paying
the
price
for
a
jp
im
going
to
grab
one
of
their
better
beers
like
laroja
that
has
a
ton
more
flavor
and
sourness
going
on
still
a
solid
drinking
beer
oone
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
had
nearly
perfect
its
a
cool
beer
overall
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
will
no
doubt
do
so
again
sometime
o
this
really
doesnt
drink
like
a
pale
ale
much
more
like
a
wild
ale
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
considering
almost
all
jolly
pumpkins
drink
like
this
i
really
enjoyed
this
bottle
it
was
on
the
high
side
price
wise
but
then
again
it
was
cheaper
then
most
any
other
wild
ale
750ml
ive
seen
i
will
buy
again
maybe
get
one
to
hide
away
and
let
the
bugs
work
for
a
few
years
really
neat
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
perfect
for
very
hot
humid
weather
a
refreshing
apertif
having
had
the
bambic
in
january
and
then
having
had
this
i
can
see
some
similarities
mouthfeel
was
velvety
slick
again
a
very
refreshing
but
nothing
really
lingered
in
the
finish
o
having
no
experience
with
this
beer
prior
i
cant
decide
whether
the
year
of
age
helped
or
hurt
it
the
sour
notes
typical
of
jp
are
still
very
present
and
the
funky
fruitiness
is
a
real
treat
a
pretty
good
brew
and
one
to
pair
with
a
spring
day
o
ron
is
a
master
of
subtle
sourness
and
incorporating
everything
oak
has
to
offer
to
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
his
beers
this
one
is
no
exception
and
comes
highly
recommended
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
not
sure
if
being
a
year
old
helped
or
hurt
d
ridiculously
drinkable
i
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
intensity
from
the
flavor
but
thats
about
all
for
how
complex
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
the
dry
finish
and
lively
carbonation
make
this
beer
insanely
drinkable
absolutely
a
world
class
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
slightly
tart
and
bitter
but
is
extremely
light
bodied
as
i
stated
no
real
tastes
stand
out
and
nothing
makes
this
beer
anything
spectacular
or
special
fairly
average
and
my
least
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
brew
high
drinkability
though
the
earthy
bitterness
can
be
a
bit
much
after
awhile
d
a
nice
beer
overall
from
jolly
pumpkin
kind
of
on
par
or
a
little
over
par
for
their
type
of
brett
tinged
belgian
farmhouse
style
cloudy
orange
amber
a
mounding
slightly
tan
head
good
retention
and
nice
lace
aroma
is
sweet
intense
with
tropical
fruits
and
a
slight
floral
character
almost
juicy
overlaid
with
a
tart
brightness
taste
is
softer
than
the
nose
at
first
then
moves
into
a
long
finish
that
nicely
combines
bitter
and
tart
qualities
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
drying
medium
bodied
slightly
tart
and
puckering
with
a
bit
of
earthy
oak
zesty
spice
sweet
fruit
and
mild
alcohol
tight
carbonation
with
subtle
earthy
oak
which
is
countered
by
spicy
pepper
and
coriander
as
well
as
sweet
citrus
peel
apple
and
pear
dry
finish
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
went
down
easily
the
spices
arent
overkill
and
the
fruitiness
balances
it
nicely
ive
only
had
a
couple
jp
beers
but
looking
forward
to
trying
the
ones
i
havent
had
yet
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
id
pick
this
up
pours
a
hazy
blonde
with
a
big
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
earthy
with
some
fruity
notes
reminds
me
a
bit
of
orval
in
this
sense
the
flavor
has
a
nice
character
of
fruity
hopes
and
a
mild
malt
sweetness
but
the
beer
is
dominantly
dry
there
is
a
very
mild
tartness
here
but
generally
the
beer
is
dominated
by
a
blend
between
some
spicy
yeast
notes
and
pleasant
hop
bitterness
poured
this
into
a
tulip
lots
of
head
on
this
one
that
looks
like
a
big
pile
of
mashed
potatoes
with
really
drawn
out
retention
more
head
than
beer
in
the
initial
pour
so
its
kind
of
frustrating
but
it
settles
eventually
leaving
a
nice
hazy
straw
colored
beer
with
a
bit
of
sediment
sitting
on
the
bottom
i
probably
should
have
been
more
gentle
on
the
pour
the
beer
also
has
big
thick
chunks
of
soapy
lacing
orange
zest
comes
to
mind
on
the
aroma
and
theres
a
bit
of
funkiness
to
this
one
with
that
bitter
hops
are
present
as
well
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
to
begin
but
it
seems
to
mellow
out
after
a
few
sips
revealing
a
candied
citrus
sweetness
and
slight
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
with
ample
carbonation
and
kind
of
a
dry
finish
overall
highly
drinkable
and
a
really
nice
beer
i
just
wish
jolly
pumpkin
beers
werent
so
damn
expensive
jd
nice
golden
color
with
excellent
head
retention
small
white
caps
form
with
a
ton
of
lacing
as
it
recedes
the
smell
is
of
citrus
grass
oak
and
belgian
yeast
it
is
a
little
yardy
in
a
really
good
way
this
beer
tastes
very
similarly
to
the
smell
with
the
citrus
right
up
front
followed
by
a
brettywoody
dryness
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
effervescent
with
a
dry
sour
finish
really
great
i
could
drink
this
beer
over
and
over
cheers
d
this
is
a
very
good
funky
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
very
good
interesting
taste
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
getting
sometime
to
try
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
huge
offwhite
fine
head
and
gobs
of
lacing
smell
is
dominated
by
bretty
yeast
funk
hay
and
barnyard
with
some
herbal
orange
and
spice
too
taste
is
mildly
tart
with
a
peppery
spice
and
some
typical
belgian
biscuitlike
yeast
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
muted
pepper
on
the
finish
overall
a
nice
one
but
somehow
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
complex
and
layered
overall
a
nice
belgian
pale
ale
that
i
enjoyed
enough
the
fact
that
it
was
a
gusher
ruined
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
for
me
very
tasty
and
complex
though
popped
the
cap
and
the
beer
exploded
and
gushed
allover
the
place
color
of
the
beer
looked
clear
and
like
honey
huge
frothy
white
head
super
yeasty
smell
taste
is
dominate
by
peppery
yeast
there
is
a
pleasant
slight
sourness
feel
is
tingly
and
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
but
it
was
nice
for
being
a
belgian
style
pale
ale
this
could
have
tasted
more
belgiany
great
looking
beer
billowy
thick
white
head
pale
copper
color
slightly
hazy
very
nice
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
lots
going
on
in
the
aroma
i
pick
up
slight
notes
of
lemon
and
pinapple
along
with
brett
funk
and
some
spice
notes
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
very
orval
ever
so
slightly
hopped
with
some
real
horse
blanket
and
hay
dry
dry
finish
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
i
get
some
of
that
lemon
and
pinapple
drinks
well
like
a
pale
ale
i
think
this
may
get
a
bit
much
after
a
while
but
it
is
rather
nice
something
familiar
about
it
that
just
says
brett
and
not
much
else
perhaps
since
this
is
not
a
particular
style
i
drink
alot
of
nor
enjoy
im
missing
some
complexities
but
it
seems
like
a
bunch
of
brett
to
me
very
interesting
though
just
to
much
peppery
spice
character
add
the
typical
polly
pumpkin
funk
to
the
mix
and
this
beer
just
does
not
mesh
right
for
me
worth
a
try
but
not
one
of
their
better
offerings
d
this
is
a
very
good
brew
overall
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
for
awhile
and
it
was
not
a
letdown
drinkabilit
fairly
drinkable
nothing
special
drinkability
another
solid
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
not
too
heavy
and
it
has
great
flavors
i
think
this
would
probably
be
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
during
the
warmer
summer
months
but
id
take
it
anytime
on
tap
at
pairings
nice
orange
color
with
big
white
head
smell
was
somewhat
muted
but
had
some
good
citrus
good
carbonation
taste
and
mouthfeel
had
the
nice
subtle
funk
that
i
find
in
many
jolly
pumpkin
beers
this
definitely
had
a
few
more
subtle
notes
to
it
than
the
more
standard
jp
beers
that
i
cant
put
my
fingers
on
overall
i
thought
it
was
tasty
and
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
but
for
some
reason
the
beer
doesnt
really
differentiate
itself
much
from
the
likes
of
oro
de
calabaza
or
calabaza
blanca
intriguing
and
unusual
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
barely
noticeable
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
even
i
can
appreciate
the
craftmanship
that
went
into
the
making
of
this
beer
and
what
a
quality
beer
this
is
impressive
cloudy
amber
with
a
dense
slightly
off
white
head
aroma
is
apples
and
on
the
acidic
side
with
a
bit
of
floral
characteristics
a
bit
of
carbonation
bite
up
front
tart
middle
where
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
comes
into
play
tart
but
much
more
subtle
than
a
flanders
red
or
gueuze
slightly
smokey
backend
with
lingering
bitterness
a
nice
contrast
for
your
typical
ipa
drinker
light
mouthfeel
pours
a
slightlyhazed
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
good
legs
as
it
makes
its
way
down
smells
of
dry
funk
with
a
bit
of
wheat
good
level
of
funk
but
hasnt
quite
hit
the
level
of
complexity
i
like
and
am
used
to
from
jolly
pumpkin
beers
taste
really
reflects
this
as
its
somewhat
one
dimensional
although
still
tasty
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
pillars
like
orval
and
westy
blonde
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
touchlight
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
bit
lower
as
its
not
quite
as
sessionable
at
least
as
far
as
blondes
generally
are
compared
to
their
bigger
belgian
brothers
as
others
of
the
style
d
a
good
beer
with
a
bit
more
character
than
your
typical
bpa
needs
to
warm
a
bit
to
truly
be
appreciated
i
just
returned
from
a
trip
to
michigan
while
in
traverse
city
i
went
to
the
jolly
pumpkin
out
on
the
mission
peninsulagreat
choice
had
a
case
of
jolly
pumpkin
beers
sent
to
me
tonight
was
the
first
taste
test
luciernaga
was
my
first
because
i
had
not
tried
it
at
the
jolly
pumpkin
pubrestaurant
the
appearance
is
a
golden
amber
generous
head
5
inches
smell
of
spice
is
obvious
but
mild
the
taste
has
moderate
hop
with
strong
spice
overtones
the
mouthfeel
has
robust
carbonation
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
good
drinkability
d
it
drank
pretty
good
and
was
quite
different
from
other
belgian
pales
that
ive
had
but
it
did
have
the
jolly
pumpkin
signature
slight
funky
tart
flavor
well
carbonated
this
drinks
fairly
easy
for
a
sour
but
for
my
second
beer
i
was
wanting
more
intense
flavor
went
back
to
my
friends
place
and
made
a
black
and
tan
with
stone
ipa
had
a
burning
river
and
cracked
some
nemesis
2010
went
to
bed
happy
this
was
an
enjoyable
bpa
fun
to
drink
d
very
good
great
flavor
that
is
at
the
same
time
very
refreshing
while
being
very
interesting
good
aroma
belgiany
with
some
light
crackery
malt
mouthfeel
is
great
i
will
be
getting
more
of
these
not
too
much
information
but
it
appears
i
liked
this
beer
ill
have
to
try
it
again
and
flesh
out
this
review
at
that
time
at
the
front
of
the
sip
the
ale
is
actually
more
hoppy
than
expected
with
a
nice
blast
of
slightly
sour
lemoncitrus
and
bitter
this
is
followed
by
earthy
spices
presumably
provided
by
the
belgian
yeast
and
coriander
while
bready
lightly
sweetened
malts
round
out
the
flavor
everything
is
nicely
balanced
the
flavors
are
complex
and
nuanced
enough
to
be
interesting
but
not
so
pronounced
as
to
be
outside
the
style
finishes
fairly
dry
and
tart
luciernaga
yum
stays
long
in
the
mouth
filling
the
senses
with
that
delicious
blend
of
belgian
yeast
and
malt
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
and
it
is
deeelectable
mmmmm
highly
recommended
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
to
be
had
and
at
6
5
you
can
enjoy
much
more
of
it
than
some
of
the
american
wilds
that
provide
more
of
a
punch
in
other
areas
this
is
a
very
good
bpa
really
enjoyed
it
enjoyed
it
so
much
that
i
ordered
another
which
i
never
do
so
says
my
beer
thought
however
the
looks
dont
match
the
taste
it
had
many
characteristics
of
a
fine
tripel
and
fewer
of
a
bpa
muffled
hops
slightly
funky
tones
of
moss
and
mold
some
oranges
and
yeast
well
balanced
and
not
so
sharp
that
its
dreadfully
dry
nor
is
it
stuffed
with
enough
grapefruit
rinds
that
it
belongs
in
a
compost
pile
instead
of
a
beer
glass
definitely
dont
judge
this
by
what
you
see
dthis
is
quite
nice
great
beer
with
a
fantastic
balance
to
it
and
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
spice
citrus
acidity
earthy
yeasty
well
put
together
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
went
down
easily
however
it
wasnt
robust
enough
to
be
very
good
worth
a
shot
especially
in
the
warmer
months
d
goes
down
somewhat
easily
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoy
jolly
pumpkin
beers
and
this
was
an
ok
offering
but
id
opt
for
other
of
the
style
if
given
the
chance
unrelated
to
the
beer
itself
i
loved
the
label
and
will
definitely
be
saving
the
bottle
im
also
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
jolly
pumpkins
beer
as
this
is
the
first
offering
of
theirs
that
i
had
d
hmm
i
dont
think
my
overall
rating
really
reflects
the
enjoyment
i
got
from
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
seems
that
when
i
compare
it
to
other
brett
beers
in
any
individual
rating
area
it
is
good
but
doesnt
quite
hit
the
upper
echelon
in
any
one
area
i
really
could
drink
this
one
all
night
and
be
happy
except
the
cost
might
kill
me
if
i
had
too
many
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
experience
i
will
be
back
for
others
poured
into
a
tulip
that
yields
a
three
finger
head
that
eventually
shrinks
to
a
thick
white
lacing
nice
caramel
color
smells
mostly
lemony
kind
of
bretty
but
not
too
much
taste
is
relatively
mild
and
crisp
most
of
the
flavor
is
tartness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
a
particularly
strong
flavored
beer
but
it
is
a
pretty
light
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
has
solid
carbonation
quite
refreshing
and
great
for
summer
d
although
not
my
favorite
sour
its
still
definitely
a
solid
sour
beer
another
good
one
from
jolly
pumpkin
split
this
bottle
with
some
friends
smells
tart
and
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
funk
while
the
taste
was
fruity
and
sour
with
hints
of
spice
and
a
slight
floral
taste
very
complex
beer
another
great
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
my
favorite
belgian
pale
ale
to
date
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
could
easily
put
away
another
glass
or
two
3
5
d
its
an
okay
beer
but
certainly
not
worth
the
price
flavors
seem
okay
on
paper
but
its
missing
some
of
the
intangibles
that
make
a
beer
great
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pear
flavor
in
beer
and
this
one
has
a
lot
of
it
d
4
5
very
refreshing
and
is
remarkably
easy
to
drink
for
a
wild
ale
d
great
beer
thought
it
was
really
easy
to
put
down
even
though
the
others
around
me
werent
exactly
crazy
about
sour
beer
on
tap
at
belmont
station
puckerfest
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
head
that
stays
nose
is
grains
funk
and
a
sweet
note
decent
taste
is
grainy
malts
up
front
then
a
nice
sourbitter
punch
310
on
the
puckermeter
and
a
lasting
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
pleasant
maybe
a
tad
too
carbonated
for
me
very
drinkable
i
like
it
more
than
the
numbers
show
d
i
recently
discovered
jolly
pumpkin
not
sure
why
it
took
me
this
long
and
i
am
hooked
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
another
bottle
in
the
near
future
luciernaga
is
a
very
tasty
beer
im
happy
to
report
the
carbonation
is
tamed
over
time
i
really
dig
this
one
everything
is
wellproportioned
give
it
a
go
as
belgian
pale
ales
go
its
not
too
bad
and
as
a
jolly
pumpkin
goes
its
pretty
alright
too
d
i
remember
having
a
bottle
of
this
back
in
early
2007
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
bottles
of
my
early
drinking
career
it
blew
my
mind
a
5
in
taste
easy
ive
tasted
it
a
couple
times
since
then
frankly
its
not
as
good
as
i
remember
this
bottle
in
taste
would
be
3
54
thats
it
i
put
it
at
4
5
because
of
the
memory
of
that
original
bottle
but
its
not
as
good
as
that
currently
batch
387388
the
beer
pours
a
clear
mediumdark
orange
color
with
a
large
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
oranges
yeast
pineapple
mango
and
some
tartness
the
flavor
is
citrus
fruit
with
some
yeast
and
lowmedium
tartness
there
are
also
some
spices
similar
to
white
pepper
there
is
a
little
funk
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
easy
drinking
very
nice
i
always
enjoy
their
beers
but
the
price
sometimes
keeps
me
away
thanks
to
my
friend
from
philly
for
bringing
this
one
up
d
pretty
easy
drinker
did
the
bottle
fine
could
probably
get
through
a
bit
more
of
another
d
easy
to
drink
but
intense
at
times
the
alcohol
is
tame
and
the
finish
is
very
clean
and
dry
the
taste
is
pretty
good
really
reminds
me
of
damnation
23
a
nice
pale
ale
with
a
ton
of
oak
oak
really
cominates
though
not
overly
complex
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
to
drink
oaky
beer
i
would
definetly
grab
this
in
the
future
d
for
a
tart
beer
fun
and
pretty
tasty
easy
to
have
a
few
my
overall
response
eh
its
a
nice
belgian
pale
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
nice
belgian
pale
but
it
doesnt
really
rise
above
the
style
the
way
i
expect
from
the
rest
of
jolly
pumpkins
lineup
an
outlier
in
the
style
while
not
quite
orval
either
but
still
good
for
whatever
reason
found
myself
not
wanting
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
however
thus
the
slightly
lower
drinkability
score
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
wild
and
tangy
with
fruity
aromas
of
apricots
grapes
and
sour
apples
the
taste
was
slightly
tangy
with
fruit
flavors
of
apples
green
grapes
and
apricots
there
was
a
malty
flavor
with
tart
tanginess
and
moderate
hoppiness
beneath
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
airy
with
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
a
light
sour
tartness
lingered
on
the
palate
this
is
probably
the
best
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
to
date
not
sure
if
this
one
improved
dramatically
with
age
so
i
will
have
to
seek
out
a
younger
bottle
to
try
overall
a
well
crafted
ale
from
the
folks
at
jp
very
happy
that
their
brews
are
distributed
to
nw
in
very
enjoyable
on
a
wet
spring
evening
would
certainly
seek
out
again
however
the
1112
pricetag
might
be
a
biit
much
for
some
but
still
strongly
recommended
for
those
who
enjoy
sours
slainte
hanks
for
sharing
drjay
pours
a
hazy
amber
body
with
a
great
frothed
up
white
head
thats
lacing
like
none
other
spices
hit
the
nose
forthwith
and
are
followed
by
sour
sweaty
grapes
estery
and
floral
with
pickle
brine
taste
of
dill
pickles
sour
white
grapes
yeasty
and
spices
in
the
mouth
great
finish
of
a
fine
wine
slight
puckering
sensation
sour
flavours
in
the
finish
wow
this
is
great
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
carbonic
dry
finish
drinkability
moreso
than
some
of
the
other
jp
beers
other
750ml
offerings
from
jp
can
be
a
handful
to
finish
by
themselves
this
is
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
that
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
absolutely
quaffable
jp
did
not
go
overboard
in
the
funk
factor
which
makes
this
one
of
their
in
my
opinion
more
balanced
beers
but
of
course
it
has
its
own
take
on
the
style
as
jp
does
with
every
style
i
have
only
seen
this
once
in
southern
california
but
if
i
were
to
come
across
it
again
i
would
instantly
pick
it
up
i
really
do
enjoy
jolly
pumpkin
and
im
not
entirely
sure
why
but
damn
do
i
love
busting
open
one
of
their
beers
and
having
a
nice
relaxing
friday
night
with
the
fiancée
while
savoring
one
cask
draft
poured
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
diminished
quickly
with
fair
lacing
complex
hop
citrus
and
spice
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
smooth
texture
and
flat
carbonation
good
complex
flavor
with
a
long
well
balanced
finish
when
i
am
in
michigan
i
will
visit
brewery
or
locate
a
bottle
this
was
an
interesting
beer
to
review
and
i
did
enjoy
it
however
the
sour
character
and
funky
aroma
from
the
use
of
brett
arent
my
cup
o
tea
overall
an
interesting
variation
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
this
this
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
definitely
has
the
jolly
pumpkin
signature
funk
but
it
is
still
light
and
drinkable
enough
to
be
sessionable
great
beer
this
is
okay
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
yet
it
tastes
exactly
like
several
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
d
this
beer
was
very
carbonated
making
me
feel
bloated
as
it
wentdown
this
is
a
big
detractor
in
the
drinkability
department
d
well
lets
see
its
bonedry
complex
and
interesting
manageable
6
5
abv
high
flavortoabv
ratio
would
pair
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
id
say
that
adds
up
to
a
real
winner
i
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
this
sits
with
e
s
bam
as
one
of
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkins
drinkability
is
great
pretty
much
no
acidity
and
hiding
its
alcohol
very
well
love
the
brett
character
and
the
great
complexity
it
has
retained
i
cant
wait
for
the
second
glass
and
wish
i
had
another
bottle
i
dont
know
if
the
depth
and
brett
has
come
out
with
the
extra
time
it
has
spent
in
the
cellar
but
its
damn
good
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
very
good
this
is
how
i
like
sours
a
mix
of
two
beers
where
the
sour
is
not
overwhelming
but
moderate
and
tasty
750

head

the

tropical

peppery

the
soft

makes
this
easy

i
think
this
is
a
good
and
enjoyable
beer
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
i
somehow
dont
get
jolly
pumpkin
im
still
looking
for
a
beer
that
i
really
like
from
jolly
pumpkin
ill
keep
tasting
them
but
perhaps
i
just
dont
get
them
love
the
labels
not
so
much
the
beers
so
far
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
d
overall
this
is
quite
simply
another
fantastic
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
now
after
trying
just
about
every
beer
from
this
brewery
i
can
say
that
they
do
not
brew
anything
less
than
great
this
beer
like
all
other
jp
beers
is
highly
recommended
jolly
pumpkin
may
be
dedicated
to
the
traditions
of
old
world
craftsmanship
but
theyre
also
clearly
intent
on
new
world
innovation
although
timeconsuming
maturation
barrel
aging
and
the
use
of
wild
yeasts
have
become
more
common
amongst
microbrewers
these
days
it
should
be
noted
that
this
michigan
brewery
was
among
the
first
to
dare
to
try
one
can
only
assume
it
is
because
of
successes
like
the
firefly
that
others
decided
to
follow
suit
smell
is
funky
alright
with
spicy
coriander
and
orange
peel
a
generally
sour
aroma
predominates
taste
is
funky
again
with
a
sweet
but
mostly
sour
tartness
over
ripe
fruit
sour
peach
not
too
acicdic
despite
the
mature
fruit
tones
balance
is
just
about
right
aftertaste
also
in
the
tart
and
sour
category
long
after
taste
lingers
with
just
a
touch
of
vinegar
that
detracts
from
drinkability
jolly
pumpkin
ales
always
seem
to
me
to
be
in
a
league
of
their
own
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
a
very
complex
and
interesting
belgian
pale
ale
that
i
heartily
enjoyed
after
dinner
tonight
recommended
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
deep
orange
with
a
huge
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
sweet
fruits
lemon
citrus
bitter
hops
and
sweet
tart
candies
flavor
is
souryogurty
at
first
with
a
dry
malty
slightly
bitter
finish
palate
is
thin
sort
of
watery
this
is
alright
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
underwhelming
drinkability
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
spices
can
be
a
bit
overly
brash
at
times
while
not
the
most
captivating
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
lineup
its
certainly
solid
and
worth
a
try
a
750ml
capped
bottle
shared
with
psycohops
and
brothercannon
poured
into
a
trio
of
plain
snifters
the
ale
appears
a
cloudy
medium
apricot
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
off
white
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
coriander
sour
green
apples
enough
sourness
to
make
you
briefly
pucker
mildly
spicy
yeast
sweet
funky
and
a
sour
quite
the
complex
ale
here
light
to
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
no
doubt
id
seek
this
one
out
again
pour
is
murky
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
balanced
head
of
tight
bubbles
smell
is
a
tart
musk
familar
to
jolly

sour
quality
not
as
powerful
as
some
others
of
the
brewery
though
night
pineapple
lemon
sort
of
orval
like
takes
is
all
there
smooth
hop
of
citrus
pineapple
lemon
pepper
yeast
a
very
mild
tart
quality
similar
to
a
flemish
wild
a
musk
sweetness
simliar
to
that
style
too
fantastic
beer
will
definately
have
again
a
must
for
bpa
fans
great
for
late
spring
d
quite
a
complex
belgianstyle
ale
yet
not
something
of
which
i
could
drink
a
full
bottle
on
my
own
i
definitely
admire
the
character
of
this
brew
and
i
will
certainly
try
other
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
in
the
future
exotic
and
tasty
i
enjoyed
this
won
a
bronze
in
the
2008
gabf
as
a
french
and
belgian
style
saison
a
funky
and
cloudy
look
of
off
orange
with
a
bright
sour
nose
with
spices
and
a
light
malt
backbone
the
sourness
combines
with
the
spices
and
malt
to
give
you
a
funky
saison
that
goes
down
easy
it
wafts
a
great
aroma
that
is
outdone
by
the
taste
one
to
savor
on
its
own
or
with
spicy
food
keep
this
baby
around
especially
in
spring
and
summer
months
id
say
this
was
a
bit
over
the
top
in
terms
of
tart
and
funk
for
a
belgian
pale
not
my
cup
of
tea
pours
a
huge
foamy
head
offwhite
good
lacing
extremely
cloudy
amber
color
fizzy
with
dark
coloring
aroma
of
spices
maybe
pumpkin
nutmeg
some
flowers
some
sour
enticing
but
not
too
strong
fizzy
sour
taste
might
be
a
bad
bottle
some
of
the
spices
but
not
very
flavorful
reminds
me
of
a
flemish
sour
or
a
geuze
soft
mouthfeel
more
flavor
as
it
warms
more
hoppy
a
very
nice
beer
although
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
sour
and
funky
out
of
this
one
form
jp
t
medium
body
with
strong
bubbly
carbonation
light
and
zesty
in
the
finish
body
is
slightly
sour
and
very
earthy
like
the
nose
grass
grains
orange
pepper
coriander
and
other
fruit
rind
like
flavors
are
prominent
body
and
finish
is
fairly
dry
yet
full
personally
i
would
like
a
little
more
sweetness
or
tartness
to
put
this
beer
over
the
top
for
me
but
still
an
excellent
american
take
on
this
style
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
orval
notes
ive
been
on
a
belgian
kick
as
of
late
and
have
only
had
a
few
of
jolly
pumpkins
offerings
i
look
forward
to
working
my
way
through
their
lineup
d
definitely
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
like
all
the
other
jp
beers
this
has
a
perfect
belgianesque
appearance
pours
a
woody
brown
with
a
thick
lacy
head
a
somewhat
light
nose
of
sweet
malts
soft
herbs
orange
honey
tart
fruit
oak
and
spicy
yeasts
taste
is
slightly
more
rubust
the
sour
fruit
and
funky
oak
flavors
come
out
a
bit
more
crisp
refreshing
body
another
unique
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
bursting
forth
from
the
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
medium
amber
color
with
plentiful
and
large
bubbled
white
head
aromas
are
full
of
tart
cherries
deep
oak
white
balsamic
vineagar
and
a
touch
of
floralness
on
the
palate
things
really
develop
beautifully
with
such
complexity
take
a
regular
bpa
age
it
in
oak
add
some
bugs
and
spices
and
you
get
such
a
rounded
and
enjoyable
beer
like
this
with
each
bottle
i
buy
from
this
brewery
the
more
i
understand
how
well
americans
can
make
beer
world
class
beer
ron
jeffereys
and
the
rest
of
jolly
pumpkin
deserve
the
recognition
they
all
to
often
do
not
receive
one
of
my
least
favorite
jolly
pumpkins
yet
smelled
great
but
the
flavor
was
just
lacking
in
my
opinion
hopefully
the
grand
reserve
sitting
in
my
closet
will
be
better
than
this
one
probably
would
not
drink
again
if
i
had
others
from
this
brewery
to
choose
from
still
worth
trying
d
way
drinkable
and
wonderfully
complex
this
is
a
beer
when
you
want
something
special
that
youll
like
a
lot
i
would
definitly
drink
this
again
and
again
very
good
highly
recomended
drinkability
is
excellent
enjoy
with
a
meal
or
on
its
own
as
a
meal
great
stuff
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
vibrance
that
la
luciernaga
has
to
offer
wonderful
stuff
grand
cru
belgian
style
pale
ale
flows
so
well
makes
me
want
to
go
and
grab
a
biere
de
mars
to
see
how
its
coming
along
surprisingly
conventional
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
maybe
some
age
would
do
it
good
highly
drinkable
chums
to
try
nice
get
some
if
you
can
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
hurts
the
drinkability
a
little
perhaps
just
the
heaviness
but
it
really
is
very
enjoyable
overall
i
wish
i
could
get
more
jolly
pumpkin
in
nj
complex
and
interesting
this
would
be
a
great
dinnertime
beer
notes
not
my
favorite
jp
but
good
nonetheless
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
the
usual
jp
funk
and
sourness
pours
bright
and
cloudy
orange
tart
sour
orange
smell
with
light
vinegar
taste
is
super
mild
lightly
funky
and
not
really
tart
at
all
faintly
fruity
but
rather
dull
and
boring
in
fact
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
some
mild
bittering
hops
not
impressed
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
some
decent
carbonation
that
comes
into
play
the
drinkability
isnt
too
high
on
this
for
me
just
because
a
750ml
of
this
stuff
would
be
more
than
enough
in
one
night
taste
is
great
with
the
oak
and
the
coriander
really
coming
through
i
taste
sour
funk
and
sweetness
its
a
great
flavor
and
has
a
nice
dryness
from
the
oak
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
great
nicely
carbonated
very
light
and
crisp
a
nice
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
jolly
pumpkin
comes
through
with
another
great
funky
beer
notes
really
diggin
this
one
today
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
lighter
and
this
hit
the
spot
brews
like
this
make
me
glad
i
live
in
michigan
good
refreshing
beer
would
be
awesome
of
a
hot
humid
night
great
american
version
from
jp
really
tartfruity
and
tasty
with
an
amazing
feel
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
however
the
gushing
nature
really
needs
to
be
looked
at
i
had
this
bottled
well
chilled
when
it
was
opened
so
there
was
really
no
need
for
the
over
carbonation
but
alas
what
can
you
do
still
a
high
quality
beer
by
all
accounts
and
something
i
will
definitely
go
back
and
try
again
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
very
nice
two
inch
rocky
head
plenty
of
carbonation
racing
up
the
glass
and
keeping
the
head
going
smell
is
funky
and
tart
taste
is
very
much
the
same
and
very
good
plenty
of
coriander
and
spice
i
didnt
get
that
much
hops
in
the
taste
plenty
of
tart
sweetness
though
and
i
love
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
these
jp
beers
are
flooring
me
great
brewer
and
brewery
d
one
of
my
favs
very
drinkable
a
little
pricey
but
i
would
definetely
love
to
have
this
beer
in
my
fridge
all
summer
long
is
it
just
me
or
do
others
seem
to
have
carbonation
issues
with
every
bottle
from
jolly
pumpkin
yup
another
gusher
after
a
few
huge
head
pours
and
more
foaming
from
the
bottle
this
one
settled
down
perhaps
45
mins
after
being
opened
so
it
ends
up
looking
medium
apricot
semi
cloudy
long
lasting
and
wild
looking
tan
head
plenty
of
eccentric
lacing
and
a
nice
floral
yeasty
nose
yummy
yeasty
brew
the
expected
coriander
medium
spicing
and
fruity
notes
quite
drinkable
complex
and
well
worth
trying
this
one
just
try
to
get
a
fresh
and
well
cared
for
bottle
from
a
store
you
trust
and
good
luck
to
you
to
me
luciérnaga
has
a
flavor
and
mouthfeel
very
similar
to
champagne
the
taste
is
tart
dry
and
spicy
and
the
carbonation
is
very
high
it
pours
with
a
very
foamy
head
that
does
not
dissipate
quickly
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
too
sour
and
bubbly
for
my
tastes
ive
had
a
few
experiences
now
with
jolly
pumpkin
ales
and
they
dont
suit
me
very
heady
beer
regardless
of
how
gently
i
poured
it
this
is
a
thick
and
cloudy
deepgold
beer
that
smells
spicey
and
vaguely
fruity
very
full
in
the
mouth
a
bit
high
on
the
carbonation
level
for
my
taste
the
flavors
in
the
beer
hit
my
tongue
in
various
stages
the
spice
hit
me
first
followed
shortly
after
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
the
grain
and
spice
dominate
the
mouth
primarily
and
the
taste
is
all
around
well
balanced
leaving
a
satisfying
cacophony
of
flavor
in
your
mouth
for
a
bit
after
the
expected
fruitiness
of
this
bottle
has
left
the
building
maybe
a
bad
bottle
drinkability
a
very
approachable
ale
that
is
as
complex
as
it
is
drinkable
another
fantastic
beer
by
jolly
pumpkin
if
you
find
this
beer
buy
it
hell
buy
at
least
two
i
wish
i
had
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
huge
rocky
foam
into
my
tulip
glass
the
smell
has
faint
fruits
banana
coming
out
more
as
it
warms
along
with
some
funky
sourness
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
earthy
like
old
wood
slightly
tart
and
the
spices
are
overall
apparent
but
not
individually
to
me
this
is
a
sort
of
beer
i
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
but
when
i
am
its
pretty
good
d
i
think
this
is
really
good
the
more
you
drink
of
it
the
flavors
build
up
on
the
tongue
and
really
create
itself
that
way
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
with
both
joly
pumpkin
beers
i
have
opened
from
the
750ml
they
both
seem
to
just
keep
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
and
have
no
clue
why
this
is
a
great
subtle
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
see
someone
making
subtle
beers
that
still
have
a
lot
of
flavor
instead
of
everyone
just
throwing
pounds
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
beer
big
gusher
of
a
bottle
luckily
didnt
lose
too
much
to
the
countertop
cloudy
tangerine
with
huge
chunky
head

nice
oaky
funkiness
taste
high
initial
sourness
that
drys
quickly
not
really
a
juicy
sourness
more
dry
woodiness
little
bit
of
citrus
i
think
this
is
the
dryest
jp
beer
ive
had
not
high
is
alcohol
but
seems
boozy
for
some
reason
pours
a
clouded
amber
gold
with
a
decent
crème
head
and
a
lot
of
bubbles
floating
up
all
over
the
bottom
of
my
wide
glass
kind
of
reminds
me
of
fireflies
nose
is
very
yeasty
with
a
talcy
chalky
edge
flavor
is
tangy
with
a
bitter
tone
to
it
also
seems
to
be
a
pretty
firm
mineral
influence
as
well
tart
is
the
name
of
the
game
here
though
as
it
kicks
you
pretty
good
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
bubble
hitting
you
and
a
decently
balanced
liquid
feel
overall
extremely
drinkable
another
fine
american
produced
bpa
the
beer
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
hint
of
amber
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
holds
a
strong
layer
over
the
beer
with
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
spicy
and
yeasty
with
some
oak
and
the
promise
of
some
tart
flavor
the
taste
hits
you
first
with
the
malts
followed
by
the
hops
and
then
brings
a
strong
spicy
flavor
that
lingers
before
the
belgian
yeast
shows
through
an
oakyness
also
exists
throughout
the
taste
the
beer
has
a
full
body
with
some
significant
dryness
overall
a
good
beer
very
complex
but
a
bit
overwhelming
on
the
spiciness
not
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
but
worth
a
try
by
the
way
i
really
like
the
label
on
this
750

bottle

and
more

into

with

feel
another
great
jp
brew
drinkability
a
great
bottle
to
open
on
any
occasion
provided
the
drinkers
can
appreciate
the
sourness
this
bottle
could
probably
benefit
from
some
aging
to
mellow
out
a
little
bit
and
develop
more
intricacies
overall
a
great
beer
worth
trying
md
good
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
creamy
light
body
smooth
with
an
above
average
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
redorange
color
the
head
is
massive
fluffy
and
recedes
very
very
slowly
into
thick
chuncky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roses
coriander
leather
earth
and
bretta
with
a
nice
tart
sourness
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
not
as
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
very
high
carbonatioin
which
gets
in
the
way
a
bit
overall
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
would
still
prefer
an
oro
de
calabaza
a
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
hazy
dark
orange
color
with
a
thick
sticky
white
head
the
head
was
like
meringue
it
had
a
spicy
flowery
aroma
taste
was
upfront
spice
then
it
became
a
little
sweet
then
a
tiny
hop
taste
at
the
end
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
that
consist
of
a
tart
corriander
and
spice
in
the
taste
more
of
the
same
a
sour
corriander
but
not
overbarring
at
all
a
bit
of
hops
balance
it
out
a
sour
mouthfeel
and
a
sweettart
aftertaste
corriander
is
big
but
sourness
balances
it
out
another
home
run
for
jolly
pumpkin
pours
a
foggy
orange
with
a
couple
inches
of
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
lots
of
junky
yeast
floating
around
nose
is
crazy
sour
fairly
sweet
caramel
malt
a
fair
bit
of

as
well
taste
is
nice
lots
of
sourness
first
off
although
not
overpowering
like
the
bam
biere
some
cotton
candy
too
very
high
carbonation
although
it
works
well
for
the
sourness
good
medium
body
a
crazyrefreshing
beer
with
an
original
unique
flavor
d
i
love
this
beer
it
is
really
unique
and
packs
in
a
massive
amount
of
flavor
into
a
beer
that
wont
put
you
out
for
the
night
highly
recommended
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
different
i
have
enjoyed
every
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tasted
and
this
was
no
exception
in
fact
this
was
probably
my
favorite
after
biere
de
mars
the
color
was
a
cloudy
orange
hazy
the
head
was
viciously
strong
and
took
a
while
to
settle
it
looked
like
whipped
fluff
sitting
on
top
of
the
brew
the
smell
was
funk
funky
funky
with
some
sour
vinegar
and
mustiness
but
i
liked
it
the
taste
was
also
sour
fruity
dry
delicious
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
are
kinda
costly
but
they
really
are
well
made
beers
excellent
drinkability
this
is
not
my
thing
i
do
not
care
for
this
beer
this
is
the
first
time
that
ive
revisited
jolly
pumpkin
in
quite
some
time
and
it
will
be
the
last
time
i
do
for
quite
some
time
d
yes
please
the
price
and
the
mildewy
smell
along
its
limited
availability
probably
keeps
this
from
being
a
repeat
beer
but
this
beer
made
me
say
wow
more
than
once
and
was
truly
a
unique
experience
overall
a
very
nice
beer
its
not
as
sour
as
jps
other
brews
its
easy
drinking
but
the
aftertaste
doesnt
quite
jive
with
me
drinkability
decent
belgianstyle
pale
ale
pairs
nicely
with
a
strong
blue
cheese
a
beer
to
go
back
and
enjoy
again
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
looked
great
with
awesome
color
head
and
lacing
and
the
taste
was
good
with
a
lot
of
layers
however
i
did
find
it
a
bit
too
sour
and
perfumy
to
be
all
that
drinkable
a
good
one
to

the
finish
is
a

and
a
touch
sour
but
not
puckeringly
so
somehow
it
remains
dry
in
spite
of
all
this
surprisingly
smooth
considering
the
tart
brett
character
mouthfeel
is
full
of
big
carbonation
which
subsides
halfway
through
and
leaves
a
half
smoothhalf
tart
feel
overall
this
is
excellent
its
tart
with
brett
but
not

so
and
everything
remains

this
to
be

to

odd

fun
aroma
of

deilcate
with

comes

slowly
fades
to

the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
spicy
belgian
yeast
aroma
laid
over
a
fine
malt
bill
its
loaded
with
spices
and
seems
almost
sour
smelling
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
flavor
that
is
accompanied
with
spices
and

belgian

finish
the
barrel
aging
adds
a
certain
smoothness
to
the

the
mouthfeel

a
full

beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
brew
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
this
is
a
damn
good
drinking
beer
easy
to
drink
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
complexity
from
this
beer
it
sort
of
remained
tangy
in
my
opinion
and
i
wished
a
could
have
perceived
a
little
more
bittereness
in
the
finish
to
round
things
out
thanks
to

for
the

if
you
like

i
could
easily
work
this
in

this
does
seem

actually
read
it
here
on
the
forums
at
beeradvocate
that
breweries
in
the
u
s
cannot
make
really
good
examples
of

has

this
beer
has
a

with
makes
it
interesting

flavorful
mouthfeel
a
little
dry

a

a
great

this
is
another
complex
ale

flavor
is
more
pronounced
than
their
other
offerings
this
is
a
good
candidate
for
cellaring
d
a
good
belgian
ale
swirl
the
bottle
because
there
is
some
yeasty
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
this
brew
which
was
a
definite
suprise
to
me
this
is
unbeatable
for
the
price
i
would
absolutely
pick
up
a
case
of
this
o
well
a
decent
and
economical
departure
from
your
typical
american
beer
but
a
not
a
strong
rendition
of
a
belgian
ale
its
a
pleasant
surprise
to
get
a
decent
belgian
style
ale
from
a
seasonal
mix
of
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
this
good
d
this
is
a
fairly
average
version
of
the
style
not
the
best
one
out
there
but
its
still
drinkable
worth
checking
out
sometime
if
you
like
the
style
a
belgianstyle
beer
from
new
york
will
wonders
never
cease
teehee
this
one
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
tawny
amber
with
over
a
finger
of
white
frothy
head
an
average
bit
of
lacing
is
eventually
formed
the
smell
is
rich
in
cloves
bananas
belgian
yeast
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
profile
is
similar
with
some
spices
clove
nutmeg
cinnamon
pepper
balanced
out
by
some
banana
belgian
notes
and
a
tiny
bit
of
diluted
bitterness
its
all
generally
good
but
somewhat
watereddown
or
something
i
dunno
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
slightly
oily
feel
overall
an
average
belgianstyle
brew
but
drinkable
nonetheless
copper
in
color
the
head
on
this
beer
was
kinda
small
compared
to
other
belgians
ive
had
the
biggest
scent
im
getting
is
of
that
belgian
yeast
its
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
some
malt
and
hop
flavor
but
the
main
aspect
is
the
drier
flavor
produced
by
the
yeast
hazed
honey
copper
with
a
finger
of
creamy
tan
foam
not
much
in
the
nose

toasted

apple

medium
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation

good
ale
just
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
drinkability
i
would
characterize
this
as
a
dumbeddown
trappist
but
it
still
is
rather
enjoyable
in
fact
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
it
is
a
fine
effort
by
saranac
with
this
one
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
dry
and
carbonation
is
lively
not
bad
for
a
brewery
that
doesnt
do
many
belgian
styles
overall
this
was
very
very
solid
indeed
one
of
the
finest
little
belgian
ales
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
seems
to
have
had
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
for
me
and
the
delicate
kick
in
the
end
was
just
what
i
needed
very
very
well
done
my
pour
erupted
in
just
over
a
finger
of
explosive
ecru
head
that
sank
like
atlantis
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
oooh
i
liked
the
nose
very
clove
definitely
a
product
of
their
yeast
also
some
ginger
say
i
just
went
down
this
road
recently
with
thirsty
dogs
twelve
dogs
of
christmas
ale
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
nice
spiciness
like
cinnamon
ginger
clove
and
orange
zest
on
the
tongue
it
was
like
potpourri
in
a
bottle
the
finish
was
pleasantly
dry
and
i
even
got
the
bottle
to
give
up
a
little
bit
of
sediment
tasty
but
not
necessarily
my
bag
unless
with
somebody
who
digs
this
sort
of
thing
the
aforementioned
old
lady
this
was
easily
the
best
beer
produced
by
matt
brewing
of
the
13
varieties
i
have
sampled
granted
its
not
some
exotic
nearly
impossible
to
obtain
trappist
monks
brew
but
i
think
the
brewers
have
done
a
nice
job
with
the
beer
and
accomplished
it
inexpensively
cheers
d
its
a
little
how
do
i
say
clean
for
my
belgianstyle
tastes
but
im
glad
that
american
brewers
like
fx
matt
are
experimenting
with
this
style
this
makes
a
good
session
ale
in
a
belgian
vein
for
when
one
wants
those
two
worlds
to
combine
and
with
that
belgian
yeast
and
mellow
hopping
its
a
great
companion
for
mealtime
while
this
isnt
an
elite
brew
its
not
bad
either
simple
and
easy
fairly
tasty
one
of
the
better
from
the
sampler
pack
in
my
opinion
drinkability
fun
to
find
in
a
mixpack
and
great
as
one
off
brew
for
brewer
experimenting
with
a
belgian
style
however
theres
really
high
standards
to
compete
with
this
being
the
end
of
the
mixpack
and
my
final
brew
i
have
to
say
im
probably
not
returning
to
saranacs
brews
anytime
soon
all
that
ive
tried
including
this
one
fit
the
style
but
just
barely
still
though
glad
i
tried
them
d
i
was
suprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
even
with
its
slightly
above
average
abv
this
could
be
a
session
brew
no
problem
light
good
tasting
not
too
cloying
make
this
simple
yet
tasty
brew
a
cheap
alternative
to
the
originals
which
are
superior
but
certainly
a
major
hit
in
the
wallet
the
beer
pours
a
medium
golden
with
a
nice
bit
of
white
head
that
laced
until
the
end
the
aroma
was
pretty
much
malt
sugar
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
burn
a
very
pleasant
rich
malt
taste
up
front
with
some
sugar
to
it
then
a
nice
alcohol
burn
to
the
finish
the
feel
is
heavy
smooth
and
a
bit
oily
a
real
pleasant
try
at
the
style
its
pretty
straightforward
and
could
be
one
youd
drink
several
of
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
more
than
2
fingers
strong
lacing
all
over
the
glass
as
the
head
receeds
the
usual
belgian
aromatics
are
present
clove
spice
and
the
tail
end
of
the
nose
includes
some
hop
character
taste
of
the
beer
has
the
clove
and
spice
in
the
front
which
was
led
on
by
the
nose
and
finishes
with
some
hop
bitterness
i
am
dissapionted

it
is
nearly

mediumlight
feel
my
final

id
drink
several
of
these
not
quite
session
with
it
but
again
this
whole
winter
pack
is
a
session
unto
itself
so
far
not
a
bad
bottle
in
the
box
i
wont
take
this
over
a
pranqster
but
i
rather
liked
it
very
drinkable
but
maybe
limited
to
two
in
a
sitting
d
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
especially
if
you
like
your
belgians
on
the
hoppier
side
overall
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
belgian
ale
could
use
some
more
alcohol
to
really
let
the
flavors
develop
also
the
hop
bitterness
is
too
strong
for
the
style
imo
d
alright
but
this
is
a
beer
to
have
one
or
two
of
at
a
time
no
more
not
a
bad
attempt
here
by
saranac
a
belgian
style
ale
that
is
decent
for
the
style
rather
impressive
dark
amber
appearance
with
decent
lace
smell
is
weak
but
of
spices
typical
of
belgian
beers
the
taste
is
better
than
most
reviews
give
it
credit
for
it
tastes
wheaty
and
spicy
with
fruit
undertones
a
bit
more
witte
or
weisen
than
balgian
ale
but
still
good
drinkability
i
think
this
one
is
a
dud
not
as
exciting
as
the
other
beers
in
the
box
poured
into
a
pilsner
style
glass
dark
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
and
great
lacing
can
smell
some
of
the
spices
thought
the
taste
was
a
little
lacking
not
as
flavorful
as
i
had
hopped
very
bitter
aftertaste
to
it
overall
it
was
drinkable
but
in
the
saranac
winter
sampler
pack
thought
this
the
weakest
of
the
6
offered
a
confusing
cross
between
a
belgian
pale
and
a
watereddown
bland
american
depiction
nothing
special
about
this
european
wannabe
flavor
complexity
was
nonapparent
slights
hints
of
honey
were
present
but
struggled
to
be
noticed
i
was
not
particularly
impressed
d
refreshing
and
clean
but
a
little
simple
overall
md
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
for
my
tastes
but
it
certainly
doesnt
have
any
bad
qualities
to
it
this
really
shines
in
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
goes
down
smooth
and
quickly
with
a
decent
taste
considering
i
bought
the
12
beers
of
winter
specifically
to
try
this
and
the
rye
ipa
i
dont
feel
too
bad
for
the
purchase
d
very
drinkable
very
comfortable
smoothdrinking
brew
from
the
people
at
saranac
ahhh
the
12
beers
of
winter
t
has
a
pearish
fruity
taste
to
it
its
definitely
sweet
but
not
overly
its
definitely
a
fallwinter
brew
different
solid
cheers
drinkability
next
d
okay
not
a
great
version
of
the
style
but
one
of
the
better
saranc
beers
overall
a
decent
beer
some
characteristics
are
really
pretty
nice
others
are
not
great
overall
when
i
read
the
bottle
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
darker
belgium
style
so
when
it
poured
light
i
was
surprised
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
thanks
jason
overall
definitely
tastes
like
a
belgian
beer
but
it
is
just
not
a
well
done
belgian
beer
good
effort
but
a
bit
unbalanced
refreshing
if
only
having
one
or
two
beers
for
sure
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
a
seasonal
12pack
at
shaws
in
windham
nh
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
body
with
nearly
two
inches
of
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
some
lacing
smells
citrussy
pithy
with
come
toffee
and
butterscotch
notes
some
spice
reminds
me
a
lot
of
brooklyn
local
1
in
the
aroma
tastes
pithy
and
citrussy
with
some
nut
grain
caramel
with
strong
hints
of
pineapple
tasty
but
slightly
astringent
though
only
slightly
which
hurts
the
drinkability
slightly
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
which
is
characteristic
for
the
style
not
as
drinkable
as
some
examples
of
the
style
but
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
a
decent
stab
at
a
belgian
beer
d
one
is
enough
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
shadow
of
what
its
trying
to
be
still
for
saranac
solid
and
cant
beat
the
price
cheers
d
a
real
good
brew
for
the
style
authentic
taste
nice
balance
a
very
refreshing
brew
id
have
to
just
put
this
one
down
in
the
its
just
okay
category
good
beer
in
a
pinch
a
good
start
but
doesnt
finish
the
trip
to
belgium
pass
on
this
one
d
all
and
all
a
pretty
damn
drinkable
and
delicious
beer
especially
considering
the
price
like
10
bucks
for
the
twelve
pack
of
winter
brews
a
thicker
body
and
a
better
head
retention
and
this
could
be
a
solid
belgian
saranac
seems
to
make
quite
impressive
season
beers
why
the
hell
arent
their
year
rounds
as
good
pours
a
copper
color
the
smell
is
a
little
manufactured
it
smells
of
fruit
but
almost
in
a
cheap
way
the
taste
is
the
same
hints
of
fruit
and
clove
notes
but
it
taste
a
little
cheap
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
overall
the
beer
is
a
little
bit
off
i
cant
really
pinpoint
it
but
just
not
quiet
right
not
one
of
my
favorite
saranacs
a
rather
good
example
of
a
belgianstyle
ale
with
quite
a
bit
of
that
belgian
character
the
finish
is
a
bit
cloying
though
and
things
could
use
a
bigger
hit
of
alcohol
and
better
attenuation
to
give
a
dryer
close
but
overall
not
bad
at
all
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
winter
sampler
drinks
alright
not
really
impressed
with
this
more
abv
maltyness
is
in
order
imo
or
more
pronounced
hop
profile
plus
just
very
disjointed
never
really
pulls
together
d
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
out
of
this
beer
but
im
actually
fairly
impressed
its
not
an
exemplar
of
the
style
by
a
long
shot
but
its
a
good
trainingwheels
beer
for
someone
new
to
belgians
drinkability
eh
i
continue
to
be
not
blown
away
by
saranac
and
this
ones
no
different
5
9
is
low
for
a
belgian
pale
perhaps
but
that
only
goes
so
far
in
making
up
for
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
just
pretty
average
there
are
many
belgian
pales
id
prefer
just
ask
props
to
saranac
who
i
consider
a
jackofalltrades
masterofnone
kind
of
brewery
for
a
pretty
decent
effort
enjoyable
and
certainly
worth
every
penny
i
paid
and
then
some
d
the
strange
sourness
gets
a
little
tiring
but
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
session
brew
reasonable
abv
and
carbonation
make
this
easy
to
drink
and
itd
be
a
decent
option
if
there
werent
many
real
belgians
available
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
from
saranac
nothing
new
or
incredible
for
the
style
but
still
a
great
beer
i
could
get
a
case
of
just
this
amber
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
mainly
banana
taste
is
cloves
banana
and
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
smooth
this
is
probably
something
that
should
be
tried
at
least
once
i
most
likely
would
try
again
d
just
not
a
big
fan
of
that
upfront
yeastsour
flavor
i
would
not
drink
this
again
does
not
seem
to
have
as
well
balanced
a
flavor
as
the
description
of
the
style
states
it
shoud
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
this
is
a
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
got
this
in
a
saranac
winter
seasonal
12
pack
for
7
buy
one
get
one
free
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
copper
color
some
creamy
looking
off
white
head
that
has
pretty
decent
retention
crazy
bubbles
rushing
vigorously
fast
to
the
top
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
the
smell
is
of
some
nice
belgian
yeast
bannana
clove
some
phenolics
some
bubblegum
fruitiness
some
candied
sugar
some
nice
malts
as
well
a
little
earthy
grainy
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
grains
malts
earthiness
up
front
with
some
nice
fruitiness
in
the
middle
finishing
with
a
nice
belgian
yeast
flavor
bannana
clove
phenolics
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
sugary
in
the
overall
taste
as
well
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
mouthfeel
in
the
finiash
as
well
medium
bodied
moderate
to
light
carbonation
pretty
good
drinkability
factor
with
this
one
has
some
of
the
good
tastes
of
the
great
belgians
out
there
just
maybe
lacking
some
of
the
complex
flavors
but
definately
not
a
bad
showing
from
saranac
most
of
their
beers
ive
had
were
just
ok
to
bad
this
one
i
could
prolly
see
myself
drinking
again
however
i
dont
think
they
sell
this
in
6
packs
you
can
only
get
it
in
the
winter
sampler
12
pack
and
you
only
get
2
of
them
great
breakfast
beer
too
had
this
one
about
an
hour
after
i
woke
up
made
me
feel
great
d
this
is
an
alright
take
on
a
belgian
style
certainly
drinkable
its
solid
but
honestly
somewhat
forgettable
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
on
sale
in
the
mixed
winter
pack
a
decent
beer
by
saranac
as
usual
they
do
a
good
job
with
a
basic
beer
kudos
to
them
for
brewing
so
many
different
styles
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
sampler
pack
pours
a
pale
red
color
little
head
no
lacing
faint
aroma
of
sweetness
and
malt
taste
is
also
sweet
and
malty
nothing
special
medium
body
smooth
finish
pretty
drinkable
for
a
belgian
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
taste
the
taste
is
an
adequate
variation
on
the
belgian
recipe
with
a
bold
sweetness
and
malty
mix
a
decent
balance
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
which
of
course
is
the
most
important
saranac
belgian
ale
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
similar
to
a
belgian
ale
a
bit
fruity
some
funk
and
a
bit
phenolic
the
flavor
is
similar
the
fruit
reminds
me
a
bit
of
apricot
there
are
some
caramel
flavors
that
would
be
out
of
place
in
a
traditional
belgian
but
they
dont
adversely
effect
the
flavor
definitely
decent
but
not
necessarily
to
style
this
is
a
buy
in
my
book
drinkability
i
think
that
this
is
ok
for
the
style
i
could
drink
three
or
four
but
not
a
six
i
think
saranac
does
produce
better
beers
than
this
offering
smells
like
band
aids
spices
caramel
malt
and
herbal
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
small
but
foamy
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
very
much
like
a
belgian
light
the
palate
is
thin
but
smooth
overall
this
is
definitely
a
half
hearted
attempt
at
a
belgian
ale
but
not
a
bad
one
at
that
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
belgian
style
ale
it
really
surprised
me
as
one
of
the
best
beers
from
saranac
md
fairly
dry
and
very
easy
drinking
nothing
outstanding
but
a
good
tasting
brew
that
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
texture
is
explosive
right
out
of
the
gate
almost
impossibly
rugged
it
pinches
and
attacks
the
tongue
before
the
beer
makes
it
across
the
palate
soon
it
quiets
but
its
just
a
jumbled
circus
with
all
of
the
conflict
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
and
was
ready
to
sing
its
praises
but
this
is
simply
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
by
any
stretch
4
0
d
this
is
one
of
saranacs
better
beers
though
its
still
nothing
special
sat
this
on
the
kitchen
counter
for
half
hour
before
pouring
it
into
a
12
oz
glass
formed
a
2
or
3
inch
fluffy
white
head
over
a
dark
straw
colored
slightly
hazy
body
the
scent
has
some
apple
fruitiness
to
it
with
almost
no
hop
presence
but
theres
a
light
sweet
alcohol
smell
in
the
mix
also
the
taste
is
the
same
but
has
a
little
bit
of
a
medicine
bite
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
full
possibly
due
to
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
id
say
just
average
on
the
drinkability
scale
of
course
i
prefer
lagers
usually
and
an
ale
aficionado
may
rate
it
higher
than
i
would
not
a
bad
choice
in
the
mixed
winter
pack
yet
not
a
great
one
d
i
dont
believe
this
one
fits
into
the
belgian
pale
ale
category
very
well
but
it
definitely
resembles
beers
produced
by
the
trappist
monasteries
its
a
pretty
good
take
for
an
american
brewery
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
im
reading
my
review
and
before
it
warmed
it
sounds
almost
textbook
belgian
ale
as
it
warms
it
became
something
entirely
different
so
while
i
dont
think
its
done
to
form
its
still
pretty
great
with
the
amount
of
belgian
ales
this
has
to
compete
with
its
nice
that
this
one
is
a
little
bit
different
poured
a
golden
brown
with
a
small
dirty
white
headso
to
speak
nose
is
sweet
and
has
a
bit
of
hop
character
too
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
presence
of
yeast
clove
and
a
bit
of
raisin
ithas
a
real
good

1st
brew
from
their
12

pour
a
clear
copper
color
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
decent

in
my
ommegang
goblet
smells
like
a
wit
more
than
a
belgian
pale
coriander
green
fruit
prevail
just
a
hint
of
nutty
caramel
malt
as
well
taste
follows
suit
more
like
a
wit
a
slightly
tart
initial
flavor
some
hop
bitterness
more
coriander
and
apples
in
the
taste
a
crisp
finish
a
dry
lightmed
body
with
a
decent
co2
level
a
quite
drinkable
brew
and
a
fair
attempt
at
a
belgian
tho
not
a
spectacular
one
by
any
means
d
a
respectable
attempt
at
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
far
far
from
best
in
class
the
belgian
ale
didnt
capture
me
as
much
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
winter
12
this
year
im
not
saying
that
i
didnt
enjoy
it
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
think
something
with
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
darker
would
be
better
for
a
winter
belgian
offering
this
is
an
average
belgian
which
means
that
its
a
good
beer
try
it
out
there
are
better
out
there
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer

take
an
average
belgian

a

is
a

with
the
medium
body
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
pours
a
deep
orangish
red
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
extremely
strong
but
it
is
descriptive
the
smell
has
sweet
notes
with
banana
some
malt
and
plenty
of
yeast
the
taste
follows
suit
very
good
flavor
not
overwhelming
starts
somewhat
malty
with
the
sweet
flavors
finishes
with
a
strong
yeasty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
ok
carbonation
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
doubt
more
than
a
few
just
because
the
flavor
might
get
to
me
but
still
a
good
beer
a
nice
offering
from
saranac
worth
checking
out
this
saranac
offering
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
slight
foamy
white
head
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
its
smell
is
its
best
characteristic
floral
hops
malty
a
hint
of
wheat
really
beautiful
the
taste
is
sweety
malty
as
well
as
bitter
not
a
great
session
beer
due
to
a
tad
too
much
carbonation
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
drinkability
sure
you
know
to
dial
down
the
expectations
when
considering
a
matt
brewing
co
brew
but
even
still
this
ale
comes
up
way
short
downhill
from
the
nose
it
lacked
any
substantial
character
or
grace
to
even
sorta
quasicount
as
an
almost
belgian
ale
getting
repetitive
here
but
this
is
pretty
light
bodied
and
feels
watery
and
just
isnt
all
that
interesting
its
decent
i
guess
but
not
anything
worth
coming
back
to
or
seeking
out
im
working
my
way
through
the
saranac
winter
sampler
and
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
i
can
now
see
why
this
is
included
in
the
winter
pack
its
like
liquid
banana
taffy
with
perfect
maltiness
and
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
an
excellent
twist
on
the
style
for
sure
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
mfd
a
good
effort
and
example
of
a
belgian
ale
im
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
one
out
but
i
would
drink
it
again
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
with
a
onefinger
head
of
yellowtan
foam
good
retention
sticky
lacing
in
thin
bands
the
aroma
was
sweet
a
balance
of
caramel
malt
ripened
fruit
and
some
toffee
the
first
note
that
hit
my
tongue
was
a
nip
of
bitterness
soon
followed
by
a
generic
maltiness
and
a
yeast
twang
as
the
beer
warmed
underlying
flavors
of
ripened
fruit
began
to
appear
though
it
did
have
layers
each
one
seemed
illdefined
and
nothing
stood
out
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
and
body
were
all
medium
a
medium
beer
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
zippy
carbonation
nicly
drinkable
d
an
ok
beer
the
flavors
are
sort
of
all
over
the
place
and
there
isnt
the
harmonious
blend
one
would
expect
but
theres
nothing
terrible
about
this
beer
either
a
decent
american
stab
at
a
belgian
though
a
bit
of
a
oneanddone
for
me
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
sticks
around
until
the
end
and
laces
nicely
smells
very
sweet
a
little
skunked
seems
like
its
trying
to
mimic
a
belgian
double
or
tripel
a
sweet
fruity
malty
taste
almost
a
little
sour
the
aftertaste
doesnt
sit
so
well
a
good
crisp
drink
somewhat
clean
it
just
doesnt
come
together
d
solid
easy
to
drink
its
alright
as
a
beer
but
its
hard
to
try
to
mimic
a
centuriesold
brew
and
this
one
misses
the
mark
a
bit
pulled
this
one
out
of
a
12
pack
sampler
i
bought
for
the
wife
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
settles
very
quickly
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
fruit
grapefruit
with
a
hops
cloves
and
spices
not
really
what
id
expect
for
this
style
though
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
fruit
cloves
and
hops
bitterness
follows
with
a
nice
aftertaste
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
noticable
carbonation
it
drinks
well
i
enjoyed
it
and
id
drink
more
but
ive
certainly
had
better
belgian
pale
ales
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
a
twofinger
beige
head
the
smell
is
bready
with
some
maltiness
characteristic
of
the
style
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
caramel
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
very
pronounced
earthiness
almost
to
the
point
of
tasting
a
little
like
dirt
the
ending
is
mostly
yeast
with
a
bit
of
apple
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
thick
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
by
no
means
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
d
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
for
5
9
abv
this
is
like
a
mix
of
belgian
paledarksaisons
ale
nothing
wrong
here
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
d
nothing
terribly
wrong
but
not
really
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
light
amberbrown
color
with
a
light
head
that
disipates
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
yeasty
smell
with
a
subtle
resemblance
to
an
actual
belgian
ale
flavor
has
light
fruity
flavors
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
im
not
terribly
impressed
this
was
certainly
a
weird
one
im
not
too
sure
what
was
belgian
about
this
one
had
a
very
hoppy
aroma
but
not
a
very
hoppy
taste
tastes
of
some
mixed
fruit
flavors
with
some
other
flavor
i
cant
my
finger
tongue
on
just
a
little
too
out
of
balance
for
me
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
color
with
a
moderate
head
although
that
fizzles
down
rather
quickly
aroma
is
slightly
creamy
and
yeasty
with
some
sweet
fruity
notes
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavor
not
overly
full
of
flavor
but
theres
some
there
not
one
of
saranacs
best
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
slightly
sour
and
bitter
aftertaste
found
one
of
these
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
left
over
from
a
winter
sampler
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
golden
hue
with
a
good
2
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipated
this
particular
bottle
had
the
taste
of
a
rusty
bottle
cap
but
this
may
have
been
entirely
my
fault
since
i
had
left
it
sitting
around
so
long
its
an
average
tasting
beer
nothing
to
rave
about
but
im
also
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
go
and
buy
more
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
very
nice
pillow
head
smell
is
mainly
grassy
hops
taste
is
not
spectacular
starts
with
a
sweet
malty
presence
with
a
decent
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
overall
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
is
fine
smoothness
is
above
average
saranac
belgian
ale
is
not
a
good
belgian
ale
but
it
is
pretty
good
beer
and
is
one
of
the
few
tmbc
products
that
i
would
consider
drinking
a
second
time
the
brewers
seem
to
have
put
a
little
more
thought
into
this
one
and
it
shows
it
has
a
thin
off
white
head
over
an
amber
color
brew
that
looks
to
have
to
have
been
filtered
the
aroma
has
a
definite
belgian
malt
and
yeast
character
that
i
like
its
flavor
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
some
classic
belgian
yeast
and
fair
amount
of
hops
that
give
it
some
citrus
and
bitter
notes
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
texture
and
carbonation
overall
its
not
as
complex
as
other
belgians
but
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
drinkability
it
was
an
ok
average
beer
i
think
have
had
better
worth
a
try
though
last
of
the
winter
sampler
and
i
saved
this
for
a
contemplative
moment
as
saranac
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
brewery
able
to
take
on
this
complex
a
brew
medium
goldenbrown
body
with
a
frothy
swiftlythinning
offwhite
head
fruitiness
apparent
enough
to
counterbalance
the
yeastso
far
so
belgian
dry
yes
oily
oh
no
slides
erroneously
off
tongue
effervescent
and
active
body
is
too
malty
to
be
representative
of
the
genre
i
believe
esthers
and
grapefruit
tastes
not
tart
howeverremains
grounded
with
malt
again
in
a
way
i
find
difficult
to
describe
the
body
is
too
small
and
the
taste
paradoxically
is
too
big
light
in
alcohol
and
odd
body
equals
a
beer
thats
fun
to
sample
but
not
up
to
the
styles
expectations
d
not
a
bad
change
of
pace
i
got
it
as
part
of
a
winter
sampler
case
although
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
as
to
drinkability
imho
it
hasnt
ive
had
belgians
that
were
more
interesting
even
tho
its
not
my
preferred
style
and
i
must
confess
to
a
longstanding
suspicion
of
saranacs
offerings
for
me
it
seems
they
consistently
miss
the
mark
and
end
up
impressing
me
as
sort
of
coarse
immitations
of
the
beers
they
aspire
to
being
oh
ill
finish
this
ale
but
im
not
converted
to
a
saranac
lover
by
it
seems
to
me
there
are
much
better
representatives
of
the
style
available
than
this
d
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
mood
in
the
end
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
overall
and
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
from
saranac
there
are
plenty
of
other
belgians
that
id
gran
before
this
one
but
it
works
well
in
the
mix
packs
that
i
prefer
to
buy
when
buying
saranac
as
you
get
a
ton
of
variety
and
most
if
not
all
usually
work
worth
a
try
for
sure
the
look
of
the
beer
is
great
for
a
pale
ale
but
the
mix
of
flavors
is
not
very
appetizing
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
was
actually
surprised
by
what
a
good
job
they
did
with
their
interpretation
of
this
style
not
the
best
american
take
on
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
might
serve
as
a
good
introduction
for
some
not
bad
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
d
o
k
it
was
part
of
a
mixed
twelve
and
i
probably
wont
be
looking
to
get
my
hands
on
any
more
d
easy
i
recommend
adding
the
yeast
to
the
pour
drinkability
very
nice
i
think
this
beer
is
as
good
as
many
other
belgian
ales
out
there
lots
of
great
attributes
across
the
board
i
got
this
beer
in
a
winter
sampler
but
it
would
be
an
awesome
session
beer
if
it
was
available
in
cases
maybe
it
would
cost
below
20
could
be
one
of
the
best
deals
out
there
try
it
pretty
good
beer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
copperamber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
left
a
thin
consistent
skim
of
foam
and
rings
of
lacing
during
the
tasting
scents
of
belgian
yeast
malt
corriander
and
hops
taste
similar
to
nose
lively
mouthfeel
and
crisp
floralhoppy
finish
not
a
bad
tribute
to
the
belgian
pale
ale
style
and
the
best
brew
in
the
12
beers
of
xmas
sampler
in
my
opinion
i
think
ill
have
another
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
saranac
beers
ive
tried
and
id
love
to
have
it
again
its
not
over
powering
a
mild
drinker
and
might
be
a
bit
better
if
served
warmer
d
drinkable
yes
craveable
no
wont
turn
a
free
one
down
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
feels
fizzy
on
the
tongue
but
creamy

the
swallow

a
thin

very
nice

low

smell
is
pleasant
and
fairly
mild
mostly
malty
with
some
subdued
hoppiness
and
some
restrained

taste
is
malty

estery
namely
bananas
but
also
a
bit
metallic
and
just
a
bit
funky
with
a
bit
of

bitterness
in
the

good

ok
the
metallic
taste
really
puts
me
off
this
beer
if
not
for
that
flaw
in
flavor
i
believe
that
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
brew
considerably
more
overall
this
was
pretty
solid
with
the
one
noted
exception
went
quite
nicely

grilled

and

overall
i
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
but
a
try
is
about
all
i
would
suggest
this
one
wasnt
all
that
bad
but
the
flavors
i
look
for
fruity
esters
were
muted
allowing
the
flavors
i
dont
want
phenols
to
show
not
recommended
pours
a
rubyamber
color
with
a
short
lasting

yeasty
aroma
the
flavor
isnt
bad
nice
attempt
at
a
belgian
although
it
doesnt
quite
match
up
to
the
real
deal
or
some
of
the
better
north
american
attempts
flavor
is
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
tail
end
fairly
drinkable
at
5

not
exactly
a
great
attempt
at
a
belgian
pale
but
drinkable
poured
with
a
slightly
murky
amber
appearance
and
thick
head
smells
of
spices
and
malt
permeate
this
one
and
small
hunts
of
fruit
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
sweet
malty
structure
but
it
feels
a
little
water
down
carbonation
is
pretty
good
though
and
saves
it
from
being
too
thin
a
really
sweet
pale
and
probably
my
first
belgian
pale
ale
i
cannot
wait
to
try
more

of
the
12
beers
of
winter

necessarily
do
back
for

nothing
great
really
sticks
out
but
its
a
nice
clean
and
crips
drink
that
goes
down
very
easily
i
would
try
this
one
again
if
i
had
the
chance
poured
a
deep
red
amber
into
a
nonic
with
a
half
inch
of
creamy
white
head
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
spicy

of
cloves
seemed
to
permeate
the
smell
it
tasted
complex
smokey
and
spicy
a
heavy
slightly
gritty
feel
in
the
mouth
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
but
a
few
would
be
good
a
surprising
brew
from
the
winter
12pack
but
not
too
special
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
and
that
saranac
actually
brewed
something
that
doesnt
taste
like
it
had
to
have
been
brewed
by
saranac

you
know

i

raisin
and
spice
upfront
and
fades
to
a
thin
aftertaste
a
second
sip
confirms
much
of
the
same
except
that
the
aftertaste
is
actually
nice
and
dry
like
a
pale
ale
so
far
so
good
as
said
with
many
other
saranac
beers
its
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
but
again
that
watereddown
taste
has
to
go
imagining
it
would
be
best
on
tap
although
with
the
other
beers
brewed
by
saranac
i
would
be
drawn
to
some
of
their
many
other
strong
offerings
although
a
good
effort
belgian
is
not
their
specialty
thanks
jb
well
it
may
not
be
drain
pour
but
close
an
attempt
at
a
belgian
that
just
doesnt
work
imo
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
abundant
carbonation
quite
a
nice
aroma
a
bit
spicy
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
in
fact
it
tastes
quite
a
bit
like
a
wheat
beer
as
well
with
a
bit
of
extra
spice
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
this
is
actually
a
rather
nice
beer
and
im
surprised
to
find
myself
saying
that
about
saranac
this
is
a
very
fragrant
beer
with
a
nice
look
to
it
as
well
there
is
fruit
in
the
nose
maybe
a
little
malt
the
tatse
is
a
slightly
unbalanced
fruity
estery
beer
there
is
almost
a
buttery
character
to
this
beer
i
must
admit
im
not
a
huge
belgian
fan
but
i
havent
had
enough
to
judge
tjem
yet
this
is
not
the
beer
that
would
win
me
over
however
its
a
good
beer
and
may
be
better
than
i
think
it
is
but
i
would
not
count
this
as
great
i
dont
understand
why
saranac
is
so
popular
all
of
the
beers
have
interchangeable
labels
pours
a
clear
bright
copper
color
with
a
three
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
to
just
cover
the
beer
and
minimal
lace
smell
and
taste
of
clove
and
spices
light
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
ok
taste
was
ok
but
one
or
two
would
be
my
limit
for
this
beer
at
one
sitting
overall
this
isnt
that
bad
of
a
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
out
got
it
from
a
friend
who
had
the
whole
sample
pack
beef
notes
allagash
jr
drinkability
is
at
least
for
me
nil
i
literally
sent
it
down
the
drain
i
hope
this
proves
to
be
the
worst
of
the
12
pack
pours
a
clear
honey
color
thin
head
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
not
a
bad
looking
beer
but
not
a
belgian
smell
is
of
light
maltsand
spicewith
a
weak
dark
fruit
sent
body
is
on
the
thin
side
and
carbionated
taste
is
belgian
but
just
barely
sweet
dark
fruitwith
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
weak
immitation
of
this
style
decentbut
just
barely
surprisingly
better
than
most
of
saranacs
offerings
this
belgian
pale
does
get
good
marks
for
its
taste
and
appearance
slight
belgian
yeast
taste
with
faint
esters
somewhat
toned
down
grainy
flavor
in
the
background
great
lacing
and
decent
mouthfeel
drinkable
for
its
lack
of
total
flavor
a
good
version
of
the
classic
for
those
who
are
scared
of
the
real
thing
a
not
too
intense
belgium
that
contained
some
surprising
charachter
oelergud
reflection
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
on
its
own
but
what
the
hell
it
was
in
the
twelve
pack
drinkability
not
too
good
not
worth
seeking
out
d
id
pass
on
this
one
if
i
had
the
chance
drinkable
but
kind
of
lame
its
decent
not
great
by
any
means
and
definitely
not
worthy
of
being
called
trappist
style
as
stated
on
the
neckring
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
probably
wont
actually
pay
for
it
again
nothing
special
would
work
well
when
paired
with
a
garlic
flavored
cheese
another
pedestrian
offering
showcasing
the
average
consistancy
of
the
brewery
not
balanced
in
flavor
the
clove
flavor
runs
wild
and
creates
an
annoying
mouthfeel
not
a
rendition
of
a
belgian
pale
that
i
enjoyed
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
made
the
beer
fairly
drinkable
the
alcohol
was
well
maintained
by
the
taste
but
also
pretty
warming
a
nice
winter
beer
and
a
pretty
good
drinking
beer
overall
cheers
got
this
in
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
sampler
this
was
another
beer
that
i
was
initially
afraid
of
after
my
experience
tasting
and
pouring
down
the
drain
blue
moons
belgian
white
last
year
the
saranac
belgian
ale
poured
deep
amber
and
had
a
nice
lasting
head
to
it
had
a
fruity
smell
i
was
hit
with
the
taste
of
clove
and
spice
when
it
first
hit
the
mouth
but
the
spices
were
not
overwhelming
and
a
medium
hops
bitterness
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
poured
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
disapated
rather
quickly
for
a
beligan
ale
no
lacing
noticed
this
ale
smelled
the
part
of
a
beligan
sweet
sugary
spicy
unfortunately
that
didnt
transfer
over
to
the
taste
the
taste
was
watery
a
quick
sweet
spicy
shot
with
a
light
hop
aftertaste
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
knowing
what
a
true
beligan
should
taste
like
i
would
stay
away
from
this
rereviewed
on
111209
md
both
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
suffer
due
to
this
zealous
belgian
imitation
however
its
still
a
decent
brew
its
not
drain
pour
by
anymeans
it
is
a
worthwhile
addition
to
the
winter
12
pack
however
i
wouldnt
purchase
a
6pack
of
just
this
a
nice
stab
at
a
difficult
style
to
duplicate
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
out
of
the
seasonal
sampler
pours
amber
with
tons
of
bubbles
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
ive
found
myself
recently
getting
into
beligians
so
i
tried
this
one
pretty
early
in
the
pack
to
be
honest
i
was
kind
of
dissapointed
it
looks
good
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
but
it
lacks
that
something
else
maybe
its
slightly
watery
it
tastes
like
a
middle
of
the
road
micro
with
the
flavor
of
a
decent
belgian
strange
but
okay
12
beers
of
christmas
except
i
went
and
hand
picked
these
from
a
twelve
pack
at
a
mix
and
match
so
its
more
like
sixer
for
the
season
of
saranacs
that
werent
regulars
from
them
appears
a
bright
clear
amber
tone
with
a
large
off
white
biscuit
beige
head
leaves
behind
nice
even
lace
after
the
head
slowly
dwindles
away
aroma
has
a
piney
herbal
hop
heavy
iness
with
cloves
and
sweet
belgain
candi
sugar
and
other
notable
spiced
bready
christmas
tones
taste
is
heavy
on
the
clove
iwth
bitter
tree
bark
notes
kinda
tea
like
with
mild
caramle
seet
malts
and
herbal
hop
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
wtih
slightly
rough
feel
to
the
palate
although
carbonation
is
fine
drinkability
definitely
not
a
trappist
ale
for
the
record
but
it
was
decently
complex
just
lacking
some
crucial
qualities
i
would
expect
in
any
belgian
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
preference
sweet
maltiness
hangs
in
there
strongly
followed
by
a
bitter
finish
and
lingering
sour
bitterness
this
definitely
doesnt
have
the
smoothness
of
a
genuine
belgian
ale
somethings
lacking
for
sure
not
enough
complexity
is
what
i
am
concluding
to
with
a
very
annoying
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
alone
is
turning
me
off
very
much
definitely
not
a
preferred
belgian
ale
for
me
here
poured
a
nice
rich
copper
with
a
tight
formed
12
finger
head
that
left
a
trace
amount
of
lace
as
it
settled
quicklypeachy
and
phenolic
spiced
aromas
maybe
a
hint
of
green
apple
skin
as
well
not
to
bad
eh
pretty
lackluster
flavors
dominated
by
phenolic
cloviness
honestly
not
much
more
going
on
the
fruity
quality
is
lacking
a
little
boring
but
really
not
that
bad
not
one
to
seek
out
but
its
in
the
12
beers
of
xmas
packa
no
brainer
really
d
this
is
a
complete
change
of
pace
for
saranac
so
they
get
credit
for
mixing
things
up
despite
that
the
flavors
are
a
little
harsh
and
not
ideal
for
having
a
few
had
this
one
from
this
years
winter
sampler
12
pack
which
has
just
become
available
in
nw
ct
thanks
to
the
cork
in
torrington
so
far
this
is
the
best
of
the
seasonal
offerings
of
that
pack
given
that
i
have
been
disappointed
in
the
sampler
so
far
overall
about
halfway
through
it
this
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
especially
on
turkey
day
go
cowboys
while
the
color
is
a
bit
darker
light
brown
than
a
traditional
belgian
the
smell
and
taste
are
very
good
and
within
the
style
not
much
lacing
but
the
initial
head
is
pretty
good
with
some
more
intense
aroma
as
it
should
be
and
hangs
on
for
a
bit
the
aroma
is
classic
bananaclove
with
some
fruity
notes
as
far
as
the
flavor
it
is
very
good
and
on
style
in
fact
it
is
a
bit
more
subtle
than
other
belgians
i
have
had
made
in
the
usa
which
makes
it
more
enjoyable
for
me
some
peachfruit
with
definite
malt
backbone
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
bite
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
mouthfeel
is
also
good
as
the
flavors
are
subtle
as
noted
above
my
fave
thing
is
the
drinkabilityabv
while
not
listed
seems
controlled
and
the
yeast
bite
is
alot
more
restrained
than
from
other
us
versions
of
belgian
ale
i
have
had
a
really
good
belgian
from
a
ny
brewery
other
than
ommegangwho
would
have
thunk
it
good
job
saranac
happy
tday
the
taste
i
found
to
be
enjoyable
theres
a
pear
flavor
on
the
front
end
almost
like
a
white
ale
and
then
the
spices
hit
toward
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fizzy
the
beer
isnt
too
thick
or
overpowering
making
it
fairly
drinkable
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
although
nothing
extra
special
i
bought
this
as
a
winter
12
pack
pours
an
orangishbrown
color
with
a
small
head
retention
or
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
has
a
fairly
sweet
smell
to
it
has
a
very
sweet
fruity
taste
to
it
hint
of
banana
fairly
mild
malty
has
a
sweet
and
light
feel
in
the
mouth
overall
a
decent
beer
if
it
had
better
head
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
amberorange
color
with
a
thick
head
of
huge
tan
bubbles
spicy
aroma
strong
and
unmistakably
belgian
taste
is
lightly
musty
with
a
dominant
pear
flavor
the
hops
make
an
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
bready
yeast
bite
nice
for
the
style
a
solid
belgian
pale
ale
nothing
fancy
just
easy
drinking
and
to
style
this
beer
was
another
surprise
from
my
12
beers
of
winter
variety
pack
being
a
bit
of
a
german
when
it
comes
to
malt
beverages
i
am
not
a
real
fan
of
belgian
beers
something
about
the
adjuncts
and
sugar
that
often
create
flavors
that
i
dont
associate
with
beer
though
i
know
many
baers
consider
the
belgians
as
the
best
brewers
in
the
world
i
guess
i
was
thinking
abbey
de
leffe
when
i
saw
this
bottle
but
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
better
imho
it
seemed
to
be
better
color
richer
taste
but
a
more
balanced
and
heavier
mouthfeel
beverage
absolutely
loved
it
rich
clear
mediumgold
color
with
massive
foamy
head
that
lasted
and
lasted
and
then
laced
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
spicy
clovebanana
hops
is
present
in
the
smell
but
oh
so
subtle
in
the
taste
went
very
well
with
spicy
food
in
fact
it
would
have
been
great
with
anything
smooth
just
a
bit
bubbly
gold
and
not
too
sweet
extremly
drinkable
and
one
of
the
few
ive
enjoyed
right
down
to
the
last
swallow
exceptional
i
think
ill
have
to
make
trying
belgians
my
next
big
beer
tasting
adventure
the
more
i
drink
of
this
mixed
12
pack
the
less
im
liking
saranac
a
few
of
their
seasonal
beersnotable
their
wit
are
decent
but
this
twelve
pack
is
not
treating
me
very
well
overall
a
pretty
good
belgian
ale
good
yeast
strain
made
this
an
above
average
beer
i
poured
into
a
glass
from
a
12
ounze
bottle
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
great
copy
of
a
belgian
ale
it
was
a
bit
too
malty
and
sweet
im
glad
i
got
it
in
the
12
beers
of
winter
case
because
i
dont
think
i
could
have
gone
through
an
entire
case
dont
drink
and
review
one
of
saranacs
better
seasonal
efforts
pour
was
cloudy
reddishorange
with
no
head
smells
fruity
with
a
slight
bite
tastes
mild
and
sweet
leaves
very
little
aftertaste
very
drinkable
however
there
is
nothing
too
special
about
this
i
wouldnt
avoid
this
but
i
wouldnt
make
any
special
effort
to
drink
it
again
d
easy
to
drink
a
good
college
try
for
the
style
nothing
really
remarkable
about
it
but
nothing
stands
out
as
an
obvious
flaw
either
i
could
drink
and
enjoy
several
of
these
but
would
reach
for
ommegangs
rare
vos
first
im
also
not
rational
about
rare
vos
hence
the
handle
so
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
overall
not
bad
as
a
standard
belgian
pale
ale
think
de
koninck
this
has
a
lot
of
character
but
its
not
a
dubbel
which
seems
to
be
where
its
trying
to
get
to
accept
it
for
what
it
is
and
enjoy
it
with
some
mussels
and
frites
as
a
relatively
light
beer
it
was
moderately
drinkable
but
it
lacks
body
and
any
real
sustained
flavor
quaff
one
down
when
youre
thirsty
but
if
youre
looking
to
really
savor
a
beer
you
want
to
look
elsewhere
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
modest
white
head

quickly
dissapeared
no
lacing
to
be
found
smell
is
slightly
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
banana
but
very
light
taste
is
pleasantly
enjoyable
with
some
spiciness
and
a
little
fruit
hops
also
show
there
presence
a
bit
more
than
i
prefer
in
this
type
of
beer
finish
is
dry
and
bot
overly
nice
a
fair
try
at
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
too
middle
of
the
road
for
me
pours
a
twofingered
offwhite

that
fades
quickly

some
lace
cloudy
amber

light
carbonation

market
basket
concord
nh
this
beer
pours
a
some
what
cloudy
golden
color
the
smell
is
essential
absent
there
was
nothing
striking
interms
of
olfaction
the
head
was
minimal
the
tatse
was
refreshing
but
as
mentioned
others
it
was
not
far
removed
from
their
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
not
a
bad
beer
to
refresh
youself
with
but
not
worth
searching
out
either
i
usually
enjoy
saranacs
offerings
but
this
brew
seems
like
something
they
stuck
in
the
holiday
pack
to
finish
filling
it
up
not
unlike
the
way
im
filling
up
on
it
now
only
worth
a
try
once
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
appearance
but
not
by
much
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
its
watery
content
then
a
meagre
stab
at
respectability
with
its
attempt
at
a
smoked
hickory
flavour
this
beer
was
not
bad
but
with
so
many
other
wonderful
examples
of
the
style
it
makes
little
sence
to
drink
this
unless
you
are
in
love
with
it
average
in
all
aspects
and
nothing
to
seek
about
about
what
i
expected
from
the
beer
a
middle
of
the
road
not
too
bad
but
not
too
great
offering
id
say
this
belgian
pale
ale
is
comparable
with
second
tier
beers
of
the
style
i
found
it
plenty
drinkable
it
has
enough
flavors
to
keep
me
interested
no
bad
really
i
think
the
food
pairings
could
be
quite
wide
flying
solo
it
works
too
this
offering
was
part
of
a
12beer
sampler
that
i
purchased

ks
very
good
stuff
try
one
another
train
wreck
in
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
12
pack
this
is
my
first
belgian
ale
and
boy
was
i
disapointed
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
thick
dense
head
that
quickly
dissipated
fruity
cutrusy
aroma
taste
was
like
tang
sour
and
artificial
maybe
someday
i
will
be
able
to
try
a
true
belgian
ale
in
sc
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
reasonably
complex
with
no
off
flavors
to
take
away
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
d
ugh
ill
pass
in
the
future
i
cant
think
that
this
would
go
well
with
anything
it
is
easily
the
worst
belgian
i
have
had
to
date
maybe
id
go
for
it
again
if
i
ever
have
a
craving
for
cherrios
chalk
and
bananas
but
id
probably
just
bust
out
the
blender
1
5
here
because
i
could
actually
finish
it
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
copper
due
to
yeast
sediment
dense
two
finger
head
offwhite
in
color
settles
over
streaming
carbonation
lace
is
spotty
and
scarce
the
belgian
phenolics
that
the
matt
brewing
company
loves
to
showcase
are
very
apparent
in
the
nose
with
some
pale
malt
and
ripe
fruit
aromas
just
pulling
through
pilsener
malt
sweet
and
crisp
in
the
beggining
with
an
almost
lambic
taste
of
sour
and
tart
berry
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
hops
are
barely
present
and
muted
by
the
sweet
and
sour
flavors
that
surround
it
but
it
manages
a
decent
balance
despite
phenols
that
seem
a
bit
strong
for
a
belgian
pale
ale
light
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
pair
with
the
tart
aftertaste
for
a
slightly
puckering
yet
interesting
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
however
suffers
from
the
use
of
strong
phenolics
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brownishamber
with
a
small
offwhite
quickly
diminishing
head
it
smells
of
mild
malt
and
belgian
yeast
with
a
little
fruit
the
taste
is
rather
bland
with
some
nice
flavors
in
there
but
nothing
really
standing
out
it
has
a
medium
body
watery
texture
and
low
carbonation
i
feel
that
saranac
is
good
at
making
solid
consistently
decent
but
not
great
beers
but
this
one
falls
short
overall
not
the
worst
in
their
pack
the
taste
was
average
and
this
is
simply
an
average
beer
yeah
well
im
happy
enough
that
i
didnt
pay
for
this
and
i
see
why
it
was
left
over
after
the
xmas
party
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
has
an
unfortunate
medicinal
smell
and
a
astringent
after
taste
there
are
better
stabs
at
the
belgian
style
available
drinkability
is
low
because
of
the
flavor
that
i
wasnt
all
crazy
about
all
in
all
its
not
bad
its
just
a
very
average
attempt
better
than
any
macro
but
not
on
par
with
any
of
the
originals
or
many
of
the
micros
creating
this
style
light
brownorange
color
thin
tan
head
no
lace
aroma
of
yeast
touch
of
fruit
and
mild
tone
of
alcohol
taste
is
bland
bit
musty
from
the
yeast
and
a
mild
watery
feel
lacking
anything
that
stands
out
or
worth
talking
about
this
beer
never
really
took
of
there
are
way
way
better
amercian
versions
of
this
style
out
there
the
bloodhound
factor
benji
enjoyed
his
sample
no
issues
at
all
and
a
clean
dry
beer
bowl
is
a
sign
of
a
happy
dog
pours
a
nice
glowing
amber
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
little
retention
a
little
spotty
lacing
smell
is
a
nice
heavy
malt
with
a
slight
candi
sugar
note
and
a
slight
peppery
spiciness
taste
is
more
of
the
big
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
sugary
taste
a
bananapear
fruitiness
and
some
good
yeasty
notes
not
terribly
complex
for
a
belgian
style
ale
but
for
a
typical
lackluster
saranac
beer
this
one
really
has
some
great
strong
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
as
opposed
to
the
thin
body
i
was
expecting
as
is
the
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
little
offering
from
saranac
i
feel
its
the
strongest
in
the
holiday
park
and
i
would
buy
this
if
they
started
offering
it
in
6
packs
maybe
its
the
water
up
there
but
something
is
holding
back
these
outwardly
good
inwardly
mediocre
beers
back
like
the
oatmeal
stout
caramel
porter
and
chocolate
amber
this
beer
starts
strong
but
cant
seal
the
deal
not
bad
but
frustrating
and
a
bit
disappointing
this
one
is
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
puffy
head
the
aroma
is
quite
phenolic
with
a
candy
and
spice
character
theres
no
question
that
theyre
after
a
belgian
style
ale
the
spice
smell
is
framed
with
an
orangelemon
smell
and
plenty
of
pepperyness
theres
also
bubblegum
and
banana
thrown
in
the
mix
the
taste
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
relatively
high
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
prickly
sprtiziness
the
whole
thing
seems
a
little
jumbled
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
there
are
plenty
of
flavors
to
keep
you
interested
and
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
from
saranacs
12
beers
of
winter
or
christmas
came
out
a
honey
brown
color
with
very
little
head
to
speak
of
which
actually
then
disspated
very
fast
after
the
initial
pour
rather
cloudy
and
murky
throughout
but
this
may
be
from
allowing
too
much
yeast
to
escape
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
made
it
look
like
a
wheat
beer
my
bad
even
still
you
could
sense
the
floral
character
of
the
hops
present
and
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
used
overall
though
its
an
okay
beer
but
i
wouldnt
grab
a
saranac
if
i
wanted
to
drink
a
belgian
good
thing
its
not
sold
individually
there
are
plenty
of
better
beers
in
this
style
out
there
on
the
market
a
belgian
beer
for
people
who
havent
ever
had
a
true
belgian
true
in
the
style
sense
not
necessarily
geography
for
what
it
is
it
works
reasonably
well
it
is
a
hazy
dark
orange
amber
that
looks
unfiltered
a
tiny
white
head
forms
after
a
very
careful
pour
there
isnt
much
to
the
aroma
a
bit
of
sweetness
with
a
belgian
spiciness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
spiciness
lurking
in
the
background
i
also
pick
up
some
lemon
zest
as
it
finishes
the
carbonation
level
is
very
high
prickling
the
tongue
and
enhancing
the
spiciness
as
i
mentioned
in
the
beginneing
this
beer
is
sort
of
a
belgianlight
it
has
the
beginning
of
the
famous
belgian
beer
taste
but
ultimately
it
is
rather
boring
not
bad
just
not
very
tasty

but
wouldnt
really
be
all
that
interested
in
another
after
all
so
it
coats
it
quite
nicely
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
from
saranac
maybe
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
them
thus
