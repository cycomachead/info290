is
almost
more
of
an
ipa
overall
interesting
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
rye
beer
or
otherwise
a
gotlandsdricka
i
had
a
while
back
would
be
the
closest
to
the
slightly
spicy
slightly
herbal
mellowwithasharp
edge
feel
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
out
over
bengali
tiger
dark
caramel
brown
in
color
with
decent
clarity
poured
with
a
tall
dense
foam
that
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
that
left
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
earthy
rye
malt
and
citrus
hops

compete
for
dominance
but
there
is
no
clear
winner
here
medium
bodied
with
assertive
carbonation
rye
and
toasted

flavors
up
front
followed
by
citrus
hop
bitterness
finishes
with
a
fading
citrus
hop
aftertaste
and
lasting
rye
malt
presence
probably
my
favorite
six
point
offering
theres
just
not
enough
rye
ales
out
there
overall
great
beer
although
it
is
not
my
personal
first
choice
oa
different
type
if
rye
beer
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
past
due
pale
ale
yet
with
an
extreme
complexity
unseen
in
most
rye
ales
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
o
creamy
spicy
sour
malty
all
of
these
descriptions
work
at
different
times
when
drinking
this
beer
the
finish
has
a
real
bitter
edge
the
rye
is
pronounced
lending
a
woody
quality
rough
but
enjoyable
o
enjoyable
im
glad
i
bought
4
of
these
i
love
the
tallboys
i
would
order
another
o
this
is
a
nice
rye
brew
drink
out
of
the
can
because
the
look
and
nose
of
this
beer
arent
its
highlights
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
not
exactly
a
rye
it
stands
on
its
own
o
exactly
what
im
looking
for
in
a
rye
this
is
a
solid
beer
tastes
good
goes
well
with
food
or
just
for
slow
sipping
16
oz
can

caramel
and

body

and
smooth
citrusy
hops
rye
spiciness
and
caramel

combine
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
and
bitter
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
really
like
it
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
the
light
sweetness
spicy
flavors
and
subtle
earthy
hop
flavors
all
balance
together
nicely
good
stuff
found
at
pies
pints
in
middlebury
ct
this
rye
ale
shows
a
pretty
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
sturdy
near
guinness
like
head
that
is
vaguely
light
tan
colored
lacing
trails
in
a
healthy
cascade
the
nose
offers
tangy
ryewheat
and
peppery
citrus
grain
relatively
mild
but
okay
the
flavor
brings
on
a
much
hoppier
profile
with
tangy
citrusorange
and
buckwheat
grain
theres
an
interesting
malt
cream
idea
coupled
with
a
crisp
hop
and
rye
grain
medley
feel
is
brisk
with
a
energetic
wave
of
carbonation
and
body
is
a
solid
lightplus
very
refreshing
and
an
adequate
hop
quotient
worthy
of
a
try
overall
a
fairly
unique
beer
in
a
style
that
is
not
represented
to
any
great
extent
this
is
a
great
effort
and
a
beer
that
i
will
look
to
pick
up
again
sometime
omost
everything
seemed
off
in
this
beer
flavors
are
bland
and
seemed
off
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
one
was
the
rich
look
each
swirl
reproduced
a
nice
froth
heady
film
with
wet
and
sticky
lacing
around
the
glass
we
found
the
nose
to
be
a
little
weak
in
strength
and
were
expecting
a
more
pronounced
hops
character
the
taste
followed
the
nose
and
was
also
a
bit
dull
here
we
were
hoping
for
a
more
robust
strength
to
the
rye
itself
rather
than
the
rest
of
the
malt
bill
which
we
found
to
be
on
the
adjuncty
side
otherwise
this
guy
is
refreshing
and
decent
for
the
style
what
a
tasty
rye
this
stuff
is
great
and
packed
with
robust
flavor
overall
this
is
a
decent
rye
beer
nothing
mind
blowing
but
consistantly
good
across
the
board
o
an
outstanding
offering
by
sixpoint
probably
the
best
rye
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
the
body
was
nicely
full
and
wellrounded
with
a
pleasantly
crisp
bite
drinkability
was
very
good
if
this
were
available
locally
id
drink
a
bunch
of
it
regularly
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
worth
your
attention
o
i
havent
come
across
too
many
rye
beers
that
werent
rye
ipas
this
is
very
satisfying
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
overall
this
beer
just
runs
me
the
right
way
i
wish
i
could
get
it
out
west
o
instead
of
your
typical
american
amber
righteous
ale
promotes
rye
first
and
foremost
with
earth
and
spice
attributes
that
meld
well
with
the
subtle
hop
characteristics
and
a
malty
backbone
for
a
drinkable
beer
thats
still
appealing
to
a
more
broad
spectrum
of
drinkers
while
giving
said
base
style
a
new
spin
not
sixpoints
best
beer
and
not
the
best
rye
ale
ive
had
however
it
is
refreshing
and
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
summer
months
not
much
to
explore
in
flavor
but
the
amount
of
lacing
and
the
mouthfeel
make
it
great
overall
a
very
citrusforward
brew
with
enough
rye
to
add
complexity
but
not
overpower
the
hop
bill
bold
offering
from
sixpoint
pours
a
dark
redish
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
smell
is
rye
malt
some
citrus
hop
and
a
hint
of
yeast
taste
is
mostly
the
malt
and
rye
with
the
hops
and
bitterness
come
in
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
has
the
bitterness
and
rye
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
nice
consistency
and
balance
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
strong
flavors
here
that
could
turn
some
away
but
i
find
very
enjoyable
overall
a
good
beer
great
flavor
worth
checking
out
the
only
drawback
is
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
me
hard
to
pinpoint
but
had
similar
reaction
to
bengali
tiger
o
overall
a
nice
beer
from
sixpoint
good
rye
spiciness
without
going
over
the
top
hops
are
present
but
restrained
quite
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
gladly
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
all
night
long
i
find
that
i
like
the
rye
spiciness
with
a
bit
of
hot
bitterness
kind
of
a
hybrid
rye
ipa
mouthfeel
this
is
a
rye
ipa
i
am
guessing
which
is
beginning
to
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
rye
balances
out
the
hops
to
make
it
from
becoming
too
hop
heavy
which
i
really
dont
mind
on
occasion
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
down
as
smooth
as
any
session
ale
this
is
definitely
one
beer
to
find
in
my
opinion

that
showcases
the

doesnt

o
a
decent
rye
beer
the
rye
spice
is
folded
into
the
beer
nicely
with
brown
malt
flavors
giving
it
a
more
traditional
sweet
flavor
one
of
the
more
drinkable
rye
ales
ive
had
this
pours
a
dark
and
murky
brown
amber
with
a
fingers
worth
of
foam
it
has
a
light
aroma
without
a
dominant
hop
presence
its
heavier
and
maltier
than
i
anticipated
thick
real
thick
almost
with
a
definite
resiny
chew
to
it
and
a
noticeable
rye
presence
theres
a
pronounced
bitterness
thats
balanced
by
a
rounded
sweetness
as
it
opens
up
im
glad
i
spent
some
time
with
it
as
it
ended
up
growing
on
me
drinks
easy
a
good
take
on
the
style
overall
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
and
happy
to
add
this
one
to
the
mix
will
be
looking
for
more
of
this
in
the
future
the
body
is
medium
with
both
crispness
and
smoothness
but
it
all
tapers
off
toward
the
end
of
each
sip
o
a
very
enjoyable
rye
beer
not
quite
in
the
same
pantheon
as
reds
rye
but
a
strong
contender
none
the
less
d
this
was
an
interesting
brew
with
scent
and
taste
that
had
odd
elements
not
so
much
rye
as
mint
and
fennel
which
isnt
really
my
thing
the
body
was
ok
and
the
finish
was
smooth
enough
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
remarkable
beer
by
any
means
o
overall
a
nice
beer
that
brings
lots
of
unique
but
enjoyable
elements
to
the
table
o
im
pretty
impressed
by
the
taste
complexity
of
this
brew
the
malt
character
as
well
as
sweetness
are
well
balanced
with
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
there
wasnt
really
much
to
find
in
the
scent
but
then
again
i
guess
i
hadnt
expected
much
as
the
beer
seems
much
of
an
american
pale
ale
i
seem
to
want
elevated
hop
flavor
bitterness
and
dryness
to
pull
slightly
ahead
of
the
rye
malt
but
thats
not
to
be
where
i
want
more
of
an
ipa
base
this
lighter
version
keeps
me
wanting
more
overall
this
is
pretty
solid
it
is
almost
like
a
decently
balanced
rye
pale
ale
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
sixpoint
beer
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
appears
a
deep
red
with
mild
cloudiness
fluffy
1
finger
head
upon
pour
great
retention
and
tons
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
notable
rye
and
caramel
mellow
pine
hops
are
there
as
well
the
hops
come
up
front
on
the
flavor
with
mild
bitterness
lots
of
rich
malt
notes
come
through
with
plenty
of
bready
malts
some
mild
sweetness
comes
through
with
a
more
aggressive
rye
grain
flavor
coming
in
at
the
end
nice
balance
of
flavors
here
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
overall
this
is
the
best
sixpoint
offering
i
have
tried
so
far
highly
drinkable
with
plenty
of
flavor
if
this
is
at
all
representative
i
will
be
drinking
more
rye
o
my
new
favorite
sixpoint
beer
it
has
a
good
rye
character
and
a
sweetlybitter
hop
flavor
and
aroma
smooth
and
tasty
another
can
please
rye
beers
always
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
a
stylebender
and
this
is
no
exception
nice
level
of
hopping
with
spicy
herbal
notes
in
the
american
pale
ale
range
with
a
bit
of
chewyness
in
the
malt
along
the
american
amber
ale
line
rye
is
well
moderated
and
introduced
just
enough
to
lend
a
little
bite
in
the
middle
nicely
done
o
very
good
rye
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
ryes
i
have
had
will
be
picking
up
a
4
pack
soon
o
of
the
56
rye
beers
ive
had
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
lower
end
of
inyourface
with
the
spiciness
of
rye
it
does
a
great
job
combining
with
the
earthy
hops
to
make
this
very
solid
overall
o
this
is
a
good
rye
pale
ale
that
i
would
liken
to
sas
ruthless
although
rightous
came
first
lots
of
piney
hop
notes
with
rye
spice
mingling
within
recommended
for
hop
lovers
looking
to
step
outside
the
american
ipa
mouthfeel
burning
remains
for
a
long
time
across
the
tongue
and
the
cheek
area
around
the
molars
oddly
the
throat
does
not
have
this
experience
as
much
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
is
full
of
rye
and
pine
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
complex
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
and
rye
notes
as
well
as
some
nice
bitter
pine
and
orange
citrus
notes
the
beer
is
fairly
spicy
overall
and
is
refreshing
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
this
is
a
nother
example
of
sixpoints
ability
to
brew
great
ips
fresh
with
hints
of
rye
bread
this
beer
is
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
like
there
resin
fresh
and
rye
like
great
for
pasta
overall
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
doesnt
excite
me
too
much
but
would
drink
it
again
in
a
second
a
good
standard
for
the
rye
beer
style
poured
from
the
can
the
beer
produced
an
orange
tint
with
a
very
slight
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
little
odd
for
a
rye
beer
being
slightly
fruity
and
slightly
indescribable
taking
the
dive
the
initial
taste
was
orange
with
a
mild
flavor
of
rye
drawing
the
attention
of
the
side
of
the
tongue
a
hint
of
tea
is
also
present
this
might
be
an
odd
point
of
comparison
but
i
cant
be
the
only
person
the
chews
on
popsicle
sticks
after
eating
the
popsicle
that
said
something
about
the
taste
reminds
me
of
chewing
on
the
stick
of
a
orange
dreamsicle
there
is
a
synthetic
orange
and
a
little
woodiness
a
smooth
drinker
the
aftertaste
fades
into
a
mild
citric
and
hoppy
taste
it
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
throat
but
does
not
make
an
overwhelming
impression
o
the
best
rye
beer
ive
ever
had
downright
fantastic
this
one
is
dark
looking
and
tasting
it
looks
to
be
well
made
clear
and
the
can
further
helps
keep
it
pure
my
plastic
hotel
cup
is
covered
in
lovely
lace
its
mostly
hops
bitterness
without
much
of
a
malty
or
yeasty
character
all
appropriate
for
the
style
recommened
i
will
buy
again
overall
im
a
little
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
its
serviceable
but
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
come
together
completely
and
the
sweetness
nearly
overpowers
the
rye
at
times
still
there
are
no
unpleasant
tastes
and
id
drink
it
again
tastetoasted
malt
citrus
spicy
rye
and
spicy
yeast
note
interesting
flavor
keeps
you
coming
back
for
another
sip
overall
impressive
hoppy
as
hell
and
very
drinkible
smooth
rye
and
malts
work
well
to
mellow
out
the
hop
bomb
a
nice
twist
on
a
rye
ipa
that
will
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
really
nice
job
this
is
one
of
the
best
for
sure

a
4
pack
this
is
my
first
sixpoint
brew
and
ill
have
to
try
some
other
ones
now
the
rating
was
high
on
this
one
which
made
me
give
sixpoint
another
shot
i
have
to
admit
im
disappointed
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
nothing
stands
out
about
this
one
its
got
a
long
way
to
go
to
stack
up
to
a
rye
like
reds
rye
or
hop
rod
rye
the
hop
profiles
seem
very
similar
for
all
the
sixpoint
beers
ive
had
not
enough
aroma
paired
with
firm
bitterness
leaving
them
unbalanced
o
nice
beer
from
a
can
i
have
had
a
few
rye
ipas
this
seems
more
like
a
rye
pale
ale
very
drinkable
and
something
i
would
definitely
pick
up
for
a
tailgate
or
bbq
nice
beer
this
is
my
first
sixpoint
offering
my
mind
isnt
blown
but
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
hopheads
should
try
along
with
founders
red
rye
this
offering
is
a
standout
in
a
style
that
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
among
brewers
overall
a
decent
rye
beer
bitterness
more
inline
with
an
ipa
than
expected
not
sure
why
the
aroma
is
so
muted
not
on
the
same
level
as
hop
rod
rye
or
reds
rye
but
nice
to
have
another
can
option
overall
a
good
showcase
of
what
rye
can
do
in
a
beer
very
flavorful
d
i
like
hoppy
rye
ales
a
lot
and
this
certainly
fits
the
bill
call
it
can
cognitive
dissonance
but
it
still
feels
a
bit
unusual
to
pour
such
an
unrestrained
ale
from
a
can
a
bit
of
a
sipper
and
not
the
most
accessible
from
the
style
but
its
very
nice
nonetheless
after
pouring
my
first
one
of
these
into
a
pint
it
changed
everything
you
cant
go
commercial
ever
again
after
having
one
or
a
whole
four
pack
of
these
bad
boys
this
is
the
perfect
ale
and
a
standard
that
others
should
follow
i
havent
had
many
rye
ales
but
this
beer
will
make
you
thirst
for
more
the
look
the
smell
and
the
tast
are
exceptional
this
beer
is
also
drinkable
no
your
not
going
to
drink
ten
of
these
but
there
is
no
need
to
anyways
after
having
one
you
will
want
another
though
and
probably
another
after
that
and
it
has
some
kick
to
it
too
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth

a

sixpoint

to

i
am
loving
all
that
i
have

from
them
i

be

better
sixpoints
decision
to
start
canning
and
distributing
their
beers
may
have
been
the
best
thing
to
happen
to
craft
beer
in
2011
enjoying
a
pint
of
righteous
ale
is
probably
the
best
thing
to
happen
to
me
today
i
make
no
secret
of
my
love
for
this
brooklyn
brewery
who
seem
to
do
good
by
just
about
any
style
of
beer
they
put
their
minds
to
tastes
a
bit
more
boilerplate
than
it
smells
its
still
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
the
balance
doesnt
quite
come
together
as
well
the
rye
is
a
bit
more
aggresive
and
blots
out
the
interesting
and
not
all
that
typical
caramel
nodes
that
made
the
aromatic
malt
profile
so
interesting
this
is
still
backed
up
pretty
well
by
the
hoppy
back
end
though
and
the
longlingering
rye
aftertaste
is
pretty
kickass
o
what
can
i
say
this
beer
is
thoroughly
boring
tasting
it
is
clean
tasting
at
least
with
a
pleasant
flavor
but
just
boring
needs
much
more
of
a
hop
injection
and
some
more
tang
i
recall
these
characteristics
on
tap
but
in
the
can
not
so
much
id
recommend
trying
this
on
tap
for
sure
but
in
the
can
d
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
and
very
refreshing
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
provides
some
nice
balance
for
the
hops
the
bitterness
restrains
the
drinkability
to
some
extent
but
overall
its
definitely
work
trying
can
poured
a
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
spicy
rye
malt
with
solid
hosp
presence
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
spicy
rye
malt
with
a
solid
hosp
presence
with
some
medium
bitter
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
a
creamy
texture
and
good
carbonation
really
enjoyable
and
quiet
refreshing
this
pours
pours
a
very
smooth
and
light
bodied
nice
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
soapy
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
and
piney
there
is
definitely
a
lot
of
rye
here
it
smells
like
a
rye
pale
similar
to
founders
reds
rye
the
flavors
too
have
plenty
of
rye
its
smooth
and
the
malt
bill
contains
the
happiness
quite
well
the
piney
happiness
is
just
right
it
drinks
very
very
smoothly
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
rye
pale
ale
it
is
perfectly
built
for
a
can
its
good
to
see
a
rye
from
a
can
with
crossover
appeal
overall
i
love
love
love
this
beer
this
is
what
i
wish
more
rye
beers
would
taste
like
this
one
screams
rye
yet
there
are
enough
other
flavors
there
to
make
it
complex
this
one
is
not
overly
bitter
so
i
can
enjoy
the
bready
taste
i
am
getting
this
again
superior
beer
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
not
hoppy
or
overly
malty
but
just
a
great
tasting
beer
unlike
a
lot
beers
this
one
does
not
hit
you
at
first
taste
it
actually
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
it
i
get
a
sublte
chocolate
smoke
light
sweet
and
earthly
like
flavor
great
job
sixpoint
cant
wait
to
try
your
other
beers
o
easily
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
would
pass
in
store
but
drink
if
offered
one
notes
i
woud
love
to
pair
this
with
a
cornbeef
special
sandwich
especially
with
a
really
nice
strong
swiss
or
gruyere
cheese
would
be
a
thing
of
beauty
o
an
excellent
beer
from
sixpoint
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
delicious
flavor
and
manageable
alc
vol
o
overall
a
good
rye
beer
ton
of
rye
obviously
so
if
you
like
that
well
worth
checking
out
i
liked
the
nose
quite
a
bit
would
have
it
again
all
in
all
a
good
solid
rye
ale
o
besides
the
aroma
a
solid
beer
but
the
smell
really
drove
me
away
from
it
i
remember
having
on
tap
before
and
it
definitely
did
not
smell
this
strong
poured
out
as
a
rich
looking
amber
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
has
a
decent
amount
of
retention
and
lacing
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
malt
backbone
to
it
with
some
toasted
notes
and
a
spiced
aroma
coming
off
of
it
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
has
a
hefty
amount
of
rye
in
it
which
is
nice
it
brings
in
a
good
amount
of
spice
to
the
beer
the
flavors
leave
your
taste
buds
tingling
with
the
blend
of
hops
and
rye
that
they
use
here
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
it
leaves
the
mouth
asking
for
another
sip
its
a
drinkable
brew
for
sure
overall
its
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
i
like
it
because
i
can
actually
get
a
healthy
amount
of
rye
in
the
flavor
worth
trying
i
think
ill
come
right
out
i
love
rye
beer
but
this
easily
one
of
if
not
the
best
rye
beers
ive
had
right
up
there
with
hop
rod
rye
its
bitter
but
the
rye
doesnt
dominate
theres
a
good
herbal
tangyzestycitrus
hop
bite
that
is
really
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
its
just
world
class
overalldrinkabilitythis
beer
has
singlehandedly
changed
my
entire
mindset
on
rye
beers
i
had
initially
written
the
entire
style
off
as
i
had
not
found
a
single
example
i
liked
that
said
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
brew
that
is
supremely
drinkable
well
done
sixpoint
well
done
very
easy
to
drink
brew
with
no
hint
of
the
abv
well
crafted
and
balanced
i
would
drink
these
regularly
if
i
had
em
in
the
fridge
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
out
there
definitely
worth
a
try
again
same
hop
profile
or
yeast
of
all
their
other
beers
completely
overpowers
everything
else
very
mediocre
o
a
very
pleasant
drinker
and
my
first
rye
beer
only
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
not
very
impressed
with
this
rye
beer
would
not
drink
this
again
o
i
am
going
to
skip
the
sixpoint
line
except
for
the
exceptional
crisp
lager
their
ales
all
have
an
overbiscuited
sweet
meaty
malt
profile
that
drowns
out
all
other
flavors
it
just
doesnt
agree
with
me
and
i
have
tried
their
whole
lineup
now
o
not
my
cup
of
beer
id
drink
it
again
though
overall
a
solid
quaffable
rye
beer
glad
i
have
another
can
to
drink
o
a
wonderfully
drinkable
rye
beer
that
stack
up
with
some
of
the
best
this
is
one
damn
fine
rye
ale
there
isnt
much
room
for
anything
else
but
hey
when
its
done
this
well
who
cares
about
complexity
rye
rye
rye
glad
to
have
three
more
cans
cooling
in
the
basement
i
dont
think
theyll
last
interesting
beer
but
a
little
scattershot
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
and
doesnt
really
mesh
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
not
bad
though
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
this
was
my
first
time
with
this
beer
and
its
probably
my
favorite
of
these
sixpoint
cans
its
pretty
aggressive
overall
with
the
hops
and
rye
but
it
never
seemed
to
get
out
of
hand
at
all
and
keep
things
fairly
drinkable
i
would
probably
have
this
again
do
liked
this
one
this
puts
rye
in
the
forefront
perhaps
more
than
ive
ever
tasted
would
want
to
have
again

hints
of

short
of

this

a

tame

taste
because
of
the
robust
scent
the
mix
with
mild
bite
of
hops
and
smooth
balance
of
malt
makes
this
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
nothing
is
obnoxious
and
its
just
a
nice
chilled
out
brew
o
a
pretty
good
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
rye
which
you
probably
are
if
youre
drinking
a
rye
beer

it

well
slightly
sweet
with

the

drinks
very

super
smooth

highly
quaffable
o
the
righteous

is
a
tasty
brew
i
enjoyed
the
mix
of
rye
and
hop
flavors
and
would
definitely
enjoy
another
tall

can
for
the
win
o
i
was
really
surprised
and
impressed
by
sixpoint
righteous
im
used
to
rye
ipa
variants
but
this
is
a
different
animal
the
acidity
smoky
fruity
and
toasted
sweetness
of
the
rye
shines
through
a
complex
and
slightly
boozy
6

abv
glad
i
rolled
the
dice
on
this
4pk
o
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
rye
beer
the
spice
levels
of
both
the
hops
and
the
rye
were
able
to
play
off
of
each
other
and
the
complimenting
malt
bill
was
a
nice
addition
i
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
finish
ive
never
had
a
beer
with
this
much
rye
it
sure
rules
the
show
ive
enjoyed
sixpoint
on
draft
several
times
but
have
yet
to
be
impressed
with
one
of
their
cans
rye
beers
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
is
a
hit
nicely
done
moreys
bottom
line
i
pulled
some
strings
to
help
bring
sixpoint
into
the
area
and
im
glad
that
i
did
a
good
fall
beer
for
sure
i
thought
that
i
was
getting
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
on
my
first
sip
but
the
more
i
drink
the
less
i
notice
it
od
this
is
one
the
better
rye
beers
that
i
have
had
i
really
enjoyed
it
if
youre
looking
for
lots
of
bready
malt
and
balanced
hops
with
little
sweetness
this
one
is
the
ticket
i
will
seek
this
one
out
if
im
ever
near
ny
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
an
inch
of
head
very
little
lacing
aromas
of
malts
bread
and
some
citrusorange
peel
taste
is
of
grains
and
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
orange
peel
at
the
end
with
some
bitterness
good
balance
of
malt
grains
and
hops
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
sixpoint
has
impressed
me
yet
again
overall
its
certainly
worth
seeking
out
d
pretty
darned
good
like
i
stated
above
very
sessionable
pints
to
pass
all
night
overall
a
solid
rye
beer
thats
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
would
like
to
see
more
rye
beers
overall
because
they
certainly
have
potential
o
for
hop
heads
who
are
looking
for
a
slightly
offkilter
ipa
this
buds
for
you
i
really
liked
this
although
i
felt
the
hops
were
a
bit
too
assertive
and
bitter
and
the
rye
flavor
was
somewhat
overwhelmed
overall
this
is
an
excellent
rye
beer
the
rye
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
is
well
balance
by
the
hop
presence
very
good
seek
it
out
o
smooth
drinkability
the
rye
grains
really
makes
this
distinct
crisp
dry
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
refined
six
pack
worthy
and
a
solid
example
that
defies
the
myth
about
can
packaged
beers
righteous
by
style
not
going
to
go
with
a
formal
review
on
this
one
but
this
is
an
excellent
rye
beer
rates
up
there
with
the
best
of
its
kind
very
drinkable
very
tasty
for
sure
only
down
side
if
the
best
buy
date
is
on
the
can
this
is
good
except
that
the
can
is
in
a
closed
package
so
you
dont
know
the
date
until
you
get
it
home
not
sure
why
they
would
do
it
like
this
but
i
understand
they
will
put
date
on
outside
of
package
soon
mine
had
a
best
by
date
of
10182011
so
i
am
just
under
the
wire
with
this
one
overall
this
is
a
toppers
rye
beer
that
actually
uses
the
grain
instead
of
hiding
it
in
hops
i
also
like
the
fact
that
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
yearround
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
best
colderweather
beer
of
the
sixpoint
flagship
lineup
1
for
1
sixpoint
good
stuff
pours
a
murky
iced
tea
color
with
a
huge
3
inch
foamy
light
tan
head
that
only
slightly
settles
to
a
craggy
cap
random
swaths
of
lace
form
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
rye
bread
and
some
earthypinecitrus
zest
hops
a
very
pleasant
and
rich
aroma
on
this
one
taste
is
of
malt
rye
spice
flavors
and
some
herbalcitrus
zest
hops
very
mild
bitterness
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
rye
beer
from
sixpoint
with
some
nice
rye
aromas
and
flavors
yeah
not
huge
on
this
but
some
borderline
enjoyable
flavours
righteous
ale
is
a
simple
take
on
a
hoppy
beer
with
a
rye
twist
its
right
up
my
alley
i
dont
know
when
it
was
canned
but
considering
how
close
its
getting
to
the
best
by
date
im
all
the
more
impressed
with
how
hoppy
it
is
id
chose
this
over
bengali
tiger
any
day
overall
very
tasty
but
not
a
looker
extra
credit
for
being
canned
instead
of
bottled
wont
turn
it
down
and
will
pick
it
up
for
outdoor
activities
overall
ill
say
a
solid
very
good
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
ale
and
most
likely
would
never
drink
it
again
unless
maybe
i
was
at
a
wedding
and
that
was
the
sole
imbibement
even
then
one
would
be
enough
15
minutes
into
this
review
the
bitterness
still
hangs
on
my
palate
however
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
craft
ale
unlike
big
beer
crap
so
if
youre
into
a
hoppy
ale
with
some
nice
characteristics
by
all
means
go
for
it
righteous
is
a
spicy
malty
ale
with
some
hints
at
caramel
sweetness
a
pleasant
finish
and
enough
character
and
balance
to
retain
a
great
level
of
drinkability
ill
be
enjoying
the
rest
of
this
4
pack
one
can
at
a
time
cheers
a
very
drinkable
and
flavoursome
brew
nonetheless
i
really
enjoy
the
prominent
rye
characters
which
make
it
different
enough
to
be
recognisable
while
the
rest
of
the
recipe
is
tempered
to
make
it
approachable
and
drinkable
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
a
really
decent
little
pale
ale
i
enjoy
it
thoroughly
not
too
malty
the
rye
comes
through
some
could
be
more
showcased
and
the
finish
is
nice
with
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
id
have
it
again
im
really
hoping
this
is
an
offbatch
but
three
different
styles
great
brew
thanks
again
jim
a
decent
beer
but
my
least
favorite
of
the
3
sixpoints
i
was
able
to
sample
i
dont
really
like
rye
very
much
and
this
one
is
packed
full
of
it
o
an
amazing
beer
i
had
no
clue
it
was
this
good
i
figured
you
know
a
good
session
brew
however
it
clearly
presents
itself
as
a
sessionable
complex
beer
looking
forward
to
bengali
tiger
stay
thirsty
my
friends
thanks
to
dan
diaz
for
the
recommendation
cheers
from
cali
brotha
notes
first
impression
from
sixpoint
and
this
feels
like
quality
and
well
worth
of
its
reputation
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
welcome
to
dc
pours
a
clean
amberish
to
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
malt
small
grapefruit
like
hops
and
a
small
fruitiness
in
the
taste
small
grapefruit
like
hops
dry
graininess
with
a
small
fruitiness
all
the
way
through
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
ryeness
and
small
grapefruit
in
the
aftertaste
nice
mellow
hops
and
a
small
rye
presence
not
too
shabby
overall
this
is
a
solid
rye
beer
the
rye
flavors
are
definatly
right
on
but
i
find
this
unmistakable
yeastiness
to
the
3
sixpoint
beers
ive
had
including
this
one
not
really
offensive
almost
tastes
like
some
homebrews
ive
had
this
is
worth
a
try
but
not
sure
if
id
ever
buy
again
notes
a
solid
rye
ale
doesnt
make
an
attempt
to
hide
its
spicy
ingredients
which
makes
it
all
the
more
tasty
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
great
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
a
really
solid
hoppy
rye
ale
that
id
love
to
drink
more
of
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
sixpoint
stuff
thanks
to
smokeypeat
for
this
o
theres
lots
to
this
beer
especially
if
you
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
drinking
it
straight
down
a
peculiar
balance
between
fruitcocktailsweet
and
ryebread
bite
a
treat
to
say
the
least
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
holds
it
up
nicely
overall
a
pretty
tasty
offering
from
these
guys
glad
to
have
more
rye
beers
locally
what
a
great
beer
best
rye
beer
that
i
have
had
so
far
lots
going
on
with
this
one
in
flavor
one
of
my
new
favorites
for
this
year
overall
this
is
a
great
hoppy
rye
beer
ive
had
a
few
hop
forward
rye
beers
like
this
one
hop
rod
rye
founders
reds
rye
cane
and
ebel
but
none
showcase
the
rye
and
have
it
work
as
nicely
along
with
the
hops
as
this
one
does
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
super
tasty
and
enjoyable
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
thats
not
afraid
of
hops
the
only
thing
im
disappointed
with
is
that
i
cant
get
it
where
i
live
o
not
bad
of
a
beer
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
hop
presence
nice
subtle
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
not
bad
at
all
i
like
this
one
i
might
try
to
track
down
more
cans
for
the
camp
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
out
there
the
combination
of
the
rye
and
citrus
hops
make
this
beer
top
notch
cheers

i
havent
had
too
many
rye
beers
so
cant
really
determine
if
this
beer
is
to
style
or
not
that
said
my
review
is
generally
more
to
personal
preference
than
style
as
such
i
generally
found
this
beer
to
be
decent
but
not
really
my
thing
the
earthy
bitterness
is
interesting
but
quickly
loses
its
appeal
for
me
on
tap
pours
a
deep
amber
in
color
aroma
is
hoppy
malty
with
a
hint
of
rye
grain

the
taste

in
the
background
caramel
malts
are
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
overall
a
decent
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
would
try
it
again
some
time
terrific
beer
ill
pick
it
up
again
layers
of
flavor
work
together
well
to
make
e
highly
enjoyable
brew
i
can
see
this
going
with
with
beef
or
sitting
by
a
bonfire
o
righteous
ale
continues
my
streak
of
high
scores
for
sixpoint
beers
its
a
well
crafted
rye
beer
which
much
like
sixpoints
other
offerings
really
pushes
the
boundaries
of
the
style
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
slow
down
sip
and
savor
well
done
overall
i
enjoyed
the
hoppiness
of
this
beer
along
with
the
rye
spice
solid
balance
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
another
wow
i
didnt
think
id
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
i
guess
my
expectations
were
on
the
low
side
thanks
to
most
rye
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
not
really
doing
it
for
me
this
beer
makes
me
think
better
of
the
style
recommended
body
is
a
deep
mahogany
crimson
red
with
a
large
biillowing
creamy
of
white
head
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
forms
quite
nicely
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
just
visually
if
that
makes
any
sense
aroma
is
full
of
spicy
earthy
rye
notes
with
a
back
end
citric
pine
hop
nose
looks
like
this
clocks
in
at
57
ibus
did
i
mention
im
really
enjoying
the
pounder
can
format
flavor
is
quaffingly
bitter
full
of
hops
and
spicy
rye
notes
this
is
an
in
your
face
hopped
up
rye
ale
the
only
better
counterparts
ive
had
are
from
founders
reds
rye
and
brew
kettle
red
eye
ryepa
each
sip
tastes
better
and
better
especially
if
you
like
rye
and
bitter
pine
cone
hops
a
bit
of
citrus
pith
but
really
crushing
spruce
tip
bitterness
with
just
hops
and
rye
interplaying
pretty
awesome
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
it
drinkable
but
really
a
dry
finish
for
most
of
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
resinous
with
some
hop
oils
making
it
through
in
texture
carbonation
is
smooth
and
not
overdone
really
a
nice
drinking
rye
im
kind
of
sad
only
four
came
in
my
variety
pack
overall
to
reiterate
what
ive
already
said
kick
ass
spicy
rye
ale
hopped
up
with
pseudo
spurce
tips
aka
dank
hops
overall
a
little
malty
but
not
bad
at
all
wondering
about
the
freshness
of
my
can
i
know
you
dont
want
to
do
it
sixpoint
but
you
probably
should
o
easily
drinkable
lots
of
smells
and
flavors
going
on
and
it
comes
together
quite
well
id
buy
it
again
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
hoppy
without
being
too
oily
and
sweet
without
being
sugary
or
sticky
the
rye
feels
like
just
another
ingredient
not
the
focus
of
the
beer
this
is
a
recommended
beverage
the
big
malts
make
this
a
perfect
evening
air
or
cool
weather
beer
i
cant
see
it
disappointing
any
fan
of
craft
beer
regardless
of
profile
preference
overall
i
liked
this
beer
as
most
rye
beers
have
been
too
hoppy
making
them
too
dry
or
bitter
this
one
is
very
drinkable
in
fact
even
though
i
dont
enjoy
rye
beers
this
one
is
very
tasty
nice
offering
sixpoint
overall
although
im
not
too
experienced
with
rye
beers
i
loved
the
mouthfeel
of
this
so
full
of
flavor
for
such
an
easy
drinking
brew
o
overall
the
flavors
were
surprising
but
well
balanced
cheese
pairing
at
the
time
italian
truffleinfused
sottocenere
highly
recommend
very
nice
bready
aroma
drifts
from
the
beer
it
also
has
a
very
nice
citrusy
hop
aroma
it
pours
a
deep
amber
or
mahogany
body
with
a
fluffy
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
behind
great
lacing
it
tastes
very
bitter
up
front
followed
by
a
bready
sweet
finish
it
is
a
great
beer
but
somewhat
rich
and
something
i
could
only
have
one
or
two
a
night
this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
new
favorite
brews
it
reminds
my
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
border
line
belgian
ipa
you
know
theres
rye
in
there
when
you
pour
and
see
the
beautiful
red
color
and
the
aroma
supports
the
belgian
yeast
with
an
aroma
of
dense
malt
and
the
smell
of
fall
the
taste
is
rich
malt
with
a
big
yeast
profile
and
a
nice
hop
taste
and
balanced
bitterness
at
around
8
99
a
four
pack
of
16oz
cans
you
cant
beat
the
value
and
quality
of
this
beer
two
thumbs
up
o
in
a
word
sixpoints
righteous
ale
is
fantastic
its
perfectly
balanced
and
easy
to
put
back
im
continually
impressed
by
their
quaffable
yet
complex
brews
another
knockout
from
the
other
brooklyn
brewey
possibly
the
best
rye
ale
ive
encountered
an
interesting
complex
beer
slightly
more
astringent
and
bitter
than
ideal
but
quite
tasty
into
the
glass
rye
poured
out
a
straight
brown
becoming
a
browwnish
with
hint
of
dark
red
in
the
liquid
its
dark
enough
a
stealth
pour
yielded
only
some
minor
cream
colored
bubbles
that
became
nothing
no
stick
smell
is
deep
on
the
roasted
malt
with
a
small
whiff
of
rye
hops
are
present
although
earthy
smelling
with
a
light
dry
hop
appeal
some
caramel
and
thats
about
all
taste
is
between
a
brown
ale
with
rye
which
is
probably
what
this
is
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
and
tootsie
roll
with
a
small
spicy
rye
in
the
middle
with
some
bittering
dry
hops
on
the
end
grassy
earthy
tasting
all
of
this
comes
and
goes
pretty
quick
with
an
earthy
aftertaste
feel
is
kinda
bland
not
watery
the
body
is
a
sturdy
step
from
medium
but
it
needs
more
bubbles
comes
off
as
dying
yet
not
dead
i
got
through
it
but
wont
reach
for
it
again
o
not
too
bad
this
was
one
of
the
spiciest
rye
beers
i
have
ever
had
yet
i
still
enjoyed
it
thanks
again
to
whoever
brought
it
to
the
party
overall
all
of
the
sixpoint
beers
ive
has
seem
to
have
some
similar
attributes
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
could
session
it
for
sure
o
solid
had
it
nearly
2
years
ago
on
the
cask
at
rattle
n
hum
in
nyc
and
liked
it
better
off
the
cask
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
in
the
can
if
you
like
rye
beers
which
i
do
my
favorite
from
memory
is
still
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
o
the
gas
smell
really
put
me
off
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
wasnt
too
bad
a
good
ryepa
overall
definitely
a
unique
beer
its
delicious
spicy
and
fullbodied
which
makes
it
a
nice
choice
when
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
outside
the
box
that
wont
force
you
to
commit
to
some
odd
combination
of
things
that
may
or
may
not
work
o
really
quite
good
stuff
easy
to
drink
and
a
beer
of
interest
would
pair
very
well
with
cheese
though
it
is
quite
flavorful
on
its
own
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
sampled
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
beer
ive
enjoyed
drinking
more
than
once
and
will
be
having
again
it
goes
down
easily
and
leaves
me
wanting
a
few
sips
more
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
made
very
good
rye
beer
and
well
worth
seeking
out
poured
a
deep
chesnut
hued
amber
with
a
thinner
slight
off
white
head
atop
even
after
a
hard
pour
aromas
of
sharp
ryeresinty
hopand
toasted

nice
mix
with
the
rye
really
the
main
component
big
sharp
rye
flavors
mixed
with
a
healthy
dose
of
citric
hopsa
great
combination
that
alot
of
brewers
cant
do
as
welllight
toast
as
well
in
the
background
a
great
rye
beeragain
alot
of
brewers
in
my
opinion
cant
make
a
rye
beer
like
this
yes
virginia
good
beer
can
indeed
come
in
a
can
thanks
mikey
for
this
extra
pours
a
clear
rusty
orange
with
an
off
white
head
nose
is
bursting
with
hops
and
some
really
nice
cracked
grains
edgy
a
la
rye
a
touch
spicy
and
earthy
fairly
bitter
on
the
palate
nice
hop
progression
starts
grainy
earthy
and
bitter
ends
long
hops
focusing
on
tropical
fruits
and
grapefruit
rind
very
nice
stuff
pleasant
surprise
pouring
something
so
good
out
of
a
can
o
well
done
beer
i
would
prefer
this
on
a
fall
evening
where
the
air
is
cool
and
clammy
this
would
suit
that
setting
well
with
the
malt
bill
on
this
i
think
an
imperial
version
would
be
quite
appealing
and
have
high
cellar
potential
overall
this
is
a
nice
rye
beer
taking
a
decent
apa
and
elevating
it
with
an
actually
detectable
level
of
rye
good
stuff
if
you
like
rye
beers
i
definitely
recommend
looking
for
this
one
final
thoguhts
damn
good
buy
this
o
this
was
one
of
the
toughest
beers
ive
reviewed
its
a
unique
beer
and
very
well
brewed
at
that
definitely
unique
good
to
see
another
ny
brewery
on
the
map
could
get
a
lot
of
popular
support
in
an
area
with
a
bunch
of
people
but
low
amount
of
breweries
to
divide
their
loyalties
the
final
frontier
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
my
new
goto
in
a
can
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
feel
like
more
carbonation
could
have
helped
it
in
several
categories
but
the
combination
of
the
hops
and
rye
smell
and
taste
great
this
beers
score
suffers
a
bit
from
the
look
and
smell
but
its
exceedingly
tasty
and
well
crafter
overall
very
smooth
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
overall

really
great

o
i
must
admit
i
was
wary
of
beers
from
a
can
nascar
alert
but
i
was
impressed
by
this
offering
from
sixpoint
my
dinner
is
done
so
its
time
to
drink
this
bad
boy
down
and
get
my
grub
on
cheers
o
this
beer
is
a
far
stray
from
the
traditional
rye
style
being
a
canned
beer
with
big
hop
taste
i
like
this
trend
of
good
canned
beer
keep
it
coming
6
point
as
nice
as
the
hops
in
this
one
were
i
think
a
little
bit
more
rye
might
be
an
improvement
but
not
many
beer
people
ask
for
less
less
hops
more
malt
with
that
said
righteous
ale
impressed
me
sixpoint
has
always
brewed
some
great
beer
and
im
pretty
pumped
to
have
easy
access
to
these
cans
sixpoint
distributing
its
fourpacks
of
cans
into
nj
has
been
a
godsend
ive
enjoyed
all
of
them
so
far
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
dark
ruddy
amber
and
the
creamcolored
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
makes
for
a
great
presentation
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
identical
and
the
smack
of
pine
coupled
with
the
rye
sour
and
spice
make
for
a
nicely
crafted
brew
do
not
read
that
sour
as
the
sour
you
get
from
lactobacillus
its
entirely
different
so
please
no
beer
messages
the
grains
and
the
the
hops
are
in
great
balance
and
the
rye
gives
of
a
feel
of
the
grain
spirit
making
this
sometimes
seem
like
it
has
more
heat
than
it
does
this
beer
can
cut
through
even
the
spiciest
of
food
and
ive
been
enjoying
it
with
a
spam
rice
and
cheese
concoction
that
i
make
with
a
bhut
jolokia
ghost
pepper
hot
sauce
if
it
can
stand
up
to
all
this
grain
dairy
and
capsaicin
then
it
can
cut
through
anything
d
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
goes
down
smooth
and
it
is
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
of
my
favorite
rye
beers
so
far
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
o
i
really
like
this
beer
although
none
of
their
beers
have
been
a
disappointment
this
and
the
crisp
are
beers
that
i
can
see
myself
regularly
seeking
out
from
the
sixpoint
line
up
taste
from
the
onset
is
also
dominated
by
the
spicy
rye
character
goes
a
bit
sweet
in
the
middle
and
is
dueled
with
some
prickly
hops
through
the
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
nice
thirstquencher
for
the
summertime
and
also
an
allaround
good
brew
for
anytime
pours
a
dark
shade
of
amberbronze
with
a
thick
and
foamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
nice
white
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
some
light
resinous
pine
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
citrus
character
as
well
good
rye
spice
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toasted
bread
the
flavor
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
good
balance
between
it
and
the
malt
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
amber
with
a
bit
of
rye
spice
nice
pine
throughout
great
balance
between
semisweet
malt
rye
spice
and
hops
in
the
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
slightly
chewy
with
a
bitter
finish
very
very
solid
offering
another
impressive
brew
from
sixpoint
o
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
went
to
the
store
and
bought
4
different
4can
packs
and
so
far
ive
been
impressed
with
each
and
every
one
sixpoint
is
a
solid
brewery
and
i
cannot
wait
to
try
more
brews
by
them
o
this
is
a
rather
enjoyable
rye
ale
dont
think
the
month
or
so
ive
had
this
in
my
fridge
rally
hindered
things
but
the
overall
lack
of
head
and
aroma
knocks
this
beer
back
a
bit
for
me
o
nice
to
try
a
little
heavy
but
nice
nonetheless
yknow
how
it
is
the
craft
beer
geeks
are
always
looking
for
something
to
really
stand
out
and
catch
us
off
guard
this
one
does
not
do
that
but
is
a
solid
ale
medium
bodied
with
same
for
the
carbonation
this
has
a
fine
mouthfeel
and
is
pretty
darned
drinkable
another
classy
brew
from
sixpoint
oh
wow
thats
good
the
subtlety
of
the
rye
in
the
aroma
is
more
than
made
up
for
as
the
grains
coat
the
palate
with
a
hefty
bite
of
spicy
rye
goodness
hops
do
more
than
balance
the
malt
and
coat
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
bitter
pine
resin
and
tropical
fruit
flavors
a
hint
of
medicinallike
tangy
booziness
despite
the
low
abv
is
all
that
keeps
righteous
ale
from
a
perfect
5
0
in
the
flavor
department
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sharp
with
a
well
carbonated
medium
body
overall
a
fantastic
rye
beer
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
4pack
im
already
on
2
i
can
drink
plenty
of
these
and
i
will
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
revealed
a
nice
copper
hued
amber
color
with
a
head
that
was
maybe
an
inch
or
so
high
and
balanced
out
well
along
the
walls
of
the
glass
aroma
was
heavy
hops
at
first
citrus
and
pine
but
as
it
warmed
some
balance
is
brought
forward
by
bready
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
nice
and
smooth
clean
finish
had
a
nice
bite
to
it
but
mellowed
tremendously
as
it
went
down
leaving
a
semi
dry
semi
sweet
finish
in
its
wake
d
a
very
nice
offering
from
sixpoint
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
these
and
am
glad
that
i
invested
in
the
four
pack
the
rye
is
dominant
which
should
be
the
case
another
fine
brew
from
a
brewery
that
has
yet
to
disappoint
overall
a
very
good
brew
im
very
glad
sixpoint
has
started
canning
because
i
am
absolutely
going
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
their
brews
especially
if
they
are
as
good
as
this
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
16oz
can
is
the
perfect
size
too
righteous
reminds
me
of
a
recent
homebrewed
ipa
minus
the
rye
and
add
another
20
ibus
first
impression
this
close
to
the
driest
beer
ive
ever
tasted
theres
enough
hop
to
make
this
multidimensional
even
though
there
is
nearly
no
sugar
the
body
is
still
rich
good
carbonation
as
well
o
id
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
positive
first
experience
from
my
first
sixpoint
can
this
is
a
great
rye
beer
that
sets
itself
apart
from
the
pack
with
an
amazing
smell
and
a
very
interesting
mouthfeel
o
great
beer
i
would
easily
put
it
up
into
my
top
5
rye
beers
o
a
nicely
done
ryepa
rye
can
get
harsh
but
these
flavors
work
well
together
nicely
bitter
with
plenty
of
rye
spiciness
great
for
summer
drinking
poured
a
rich
dark
red
amber
with
a
thin
finger
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
rich
the
taste
is
outstanding
a
balancing
act
of
minimal
hops
sweet
caramel
malts
and
twang
very
citruslike
for
a
rye
beer
bright
and
delicious
this
is
the
best
rye
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
one
finger
beige
over
amber
red
and
copper
hues
aromas
are
wheaty
steel
and
that
delicious
rye
grain
all
over
a
caramel
and
toasty
malt
tastes
are
that
caramel
bready
malt
and
spicy
rye
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
low
carbonation
a
little
bit
of
acidity
is
pretty
noticeable
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
hops
could
be
given
a
boost
to
balance
out
the
caramel
not
a
ton
of
retention
and
just
sporadic
lacing
d
this
is
a
very
impressive
crafted
beer
the
combination
of
the
rye
malt
and
citric
themes
is
fantastic
another
great
brew
from
sixpoint
overall
its
really
good
best
thing
ive
had
from
sixpoint
so
far
overall
this
is
a
great
rye
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
perfectly
spicy
without
going
over
the
top
its
a
fine
line
that
many
breweries
cross
so
i
appreciate
that
sixpoint
has
done
this
style
justice
now
that
its
in
a
tallboy
can
it
cannot
get
any
better
and
is
the
best
readily
available
and
economic
rye
out
there
it
look
me
a
few
sips
to
warm
up
to
this
beer
but
i
have
warmed
its
not
knock
your
socks
off
delicious
but
relatively
tasty
and
enjoyable
id
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
was
not
overly
impressed
i
like
hoppy
beers
that
are
accentuated
by
rye
but
apparently
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
accentuated
by
a
spattering
of
hops
it
was
okay
clear
deep
copper
colour
with
an
inch
of
beige
foam
good
head
retention
lots
of
clumpy
lacing
citrusy
hop
aroma
pithy
rather
than
juicy
caramel
and
nutty
malts
a
bit
bready
nice
flavour
malty
up
front
with
citrusy
hops
following
finishing
up
with
sturdy
bitterness
nutty
and
bready
grapefruit
and
tangerine
slight
hop
spiciness
slight
toffee
drying
texture
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
leaning
towards
creamy
overall
very
enjoyable
i
liked
just
about
everything
about
this
beer
including
the
balance
between
malts
and
hops
with
hops
winning
out
medium
body
nice
carbonation
bubbly
and
dry
on
the
palate
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
rye
beer
and
im
psyched
to
see
these
finally
available
in
cans
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
a
rather
heavy
than
expected
feel
overall
im
really
digging
this
rye
beer
too
bad
its
not
available
around
here
the
crack
glug
came
off
without
a
hitch
and
soon
i
had
two
foamy
fingers
of
tawny
head
sitting
there
in
defiance
this
was
a
righteous
beer
color
was
19
srm
or
how
so
many
lovibond
i
have
no
idea
i
would
have
said
14
or
15
max
does
anyone
know
what
i
am
talking
about
probably
not
which
is
one
of
my
problems
with
putting
tmi
on
labels
color
is
very
subjective
and
hard
to
calibrate
but
there
is
a
scale
for
beer
color
and
this
one
weighs
in
at
a
measured
19
srm
on
the
woody
scale
it
was
a
very
deepcopper
approaching
ruby
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
in
its
most
righteous
form
nose
was
fullon
black
pepper
and
i
will
never
forget
nor
stop
thanking
the
most
righteous
sopor
for
turning
me
on
to
rye
beers
he
was
also
way
ahead
of
the
curve
the
taxation
of
rye
was
what
sparked
the
whiskey
rebellion
here
in
the
us
and
if
you
really
want
a
treat
try
some
rye
whiskey
smoooth
and
so
was
this
beer
it
was
like
it
was
evaporating
from
my
glass
in
terms
of
its
smoothness
and
the
lacing
thick
dense
requiring
a
jackhammer
to
remove
finish
was
minty
and
peppery
but
not
pepperminty
rye
has
its
own
bite
unlike
any
hops
can
impart
these
guys
really
let
the
rye
flag
fly
cooler
fk
no
im
keeping
it
all
in
my
fridge
for
those
days
when
i
come
home
from
teaching
and
want
to
die
this
will
make
me
feel
better
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
positively
once
these
four
cans
are
gone
which
wont
take
too
long
ill
be
buying
more
much
more
overall
very
enjoyable
i
have
now
had
3
six
point
beers
and
they
all
impress
me
i
would
have
no
qualms
about
buying
this
again
righteous
ale
pours
a
nice
clear
mahogany
color
and
there
are
a
few
redorange
freckles
shining
through
the
cream
colored
head
comes
up
to
almost
three
fingers
in
height
very
nice
in
a
smaller
glass
retention
is
above
average
and
the
glass
is
absolutely
coated
in
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
solid
though
the
malty
aspect
of
the
beer
doesnt
really
shine
through
instead
the
aromas
of
spicy
earthy
rye
and
resinous
piney
american
hops
commingle
en
route
to
my
nose
the
flavor
gains
balance
and
complexity
relative
to
the
nose
but
at
the
expense
of
vibrancy
of
flavor
theres
a
definite
dose
of
caramel
up
front
before
the
rye
and
hops
from
the
nose
come
in
for
the
second
half
of
the
beer
those
flavors
just
dont
seem
as
powerful
as
they
did
in
the
nose
though
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
for
me
the
body
is
too
big
and
rich
and
is
paired
with
not
enough
carbonation
the
result
is
a
mouthfeel
that
doesnt
have
close
to
the
levity
that
i
like
in
a
rye
beer
despite
the
lackluster
mouthfeel
righeous
ale
is
a
fairly
to
very
good
rye
beer
ill
be
glad
to
have
this
one
available
in
cans
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
is
a
solid
rye
a
quality
hoppy
presence
and
a
clean
malt
bill
allow
the
rye
to
add
its
qualities
to
the
brew
nicely
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
in
the
style
taste
of
a
healthy
malt
backbone
light
pleasant
caramelization
some
molasses
and
brown
sugar
flavors
citrus
hops
complimenting
the
malt
body
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
i
have
had
this
numerous
times
on
tap
but
this
one
really
excites
me
in
cans
a
welcome
addition
to
the
ny
area
canning
line
o
the
hops
and
rye
work
well
together
and
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
one
expects
from
sixpoint
o
a
really
great
session
beer
here
opens
up
to
different
levels
as
it
warms
just
really
nice
good
job
sixpoint
i
love
this
beer
in
all
its
incarnations
equally
as
good
if
not
better
on
cask
just
a
different
experience
looks
great
in
a
tulip
dark
reddish
brown
with
some
nice
light
color
where
light
can
shine
through
slightly
opaque
ok
head
retention
and
surprise
some
spotty
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
has
familiar
sixpoint
yeast
qualities
as
well
as
spicy
rye
notes
and
a
nice
blast
of
zesty
hops
tastes
earthy
and
zesty
smokey
from
the
rye
really
nice
rye
presence
with
the
addition
of
a
fair
amount
of
hops
which
are
herbacious
and
zesty
this
beer
has
a
nice
taste
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
with
a
slight
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
all
in
all
this
is
one
special
beer
almost
sessionable
really
tasty
and
has
interesting
flavors
kudos
to
sixpoint
a
hop
forward
rye
ale
the
base
flavors
are
nice
i
noticed
with
many
sixpoint
brews
that
the
yeast
results
in
an
overly
chalky
feel
which
isnt
all
that
pleasant
it
doesnt
ruin
the
beer
but
takes
it
down
a
notch
a
shout
out
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
for
me
to
try
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
rye
taste
is
also
a
bit
hoppy
some
rye
is
present
a
bit
of
citrus
considerable
bitterness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
brew
a
very
nice
combo
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
love
the
use
of
the
rye
and
the
tropical
type
hops
wow
what
rye
character
deep
creamy
thick
rye
flavors
spicy
with
bready
malts
some
biscuit
on
the
finish
with
again
candied
orange
peel
other
citrusy
fruits
rum
earth
leather
delicoius
dank
and
full
of
lush
juicy
flavors
this
is
either
my
favorite
offering
from
sixpoint
or
at
least
on
par
with
sehr
crisp
its
light
enough
to
be
absolutely
delicious
in
the
summer
but
heavy
enough
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
other
summer
beers
definitely
worth
checking
out
and
theres
no
doubt
ill
seek
out
more
in
the
future
o
really
a
very
strong
rye
beer
lots
of
rye
beers
just
have
a
smidge
of
rye
or
some
sort
of
other
defining
characteristic
this
is
for
the
rye
lover
quite
good
odmy
second
sixpoint
experience
i
still
like
the
bengali
tiger
more
i
really
love
that
beer
this
brew
is
no
slouch
however
this
beer
is
sweet
spicy
and
hoppy
all
good
things
this
one
is
definitely
going
to
make
me
grab
the
other
available
two
in
the
future
crisp
and
sweet
action
d
very
drinkable
really
great
balance
of
hop
and
rye
flavor
from
start
to
end
the
flavors
are
nice
and
rich
and
the
beer
stays
fairly
light
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
very
nice
tight
white
lace
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
held
its
head
pretty
tight
for
a
growler
purchased
at
whole
foods
fresh
huge
hop
aroma
lots
of
bite
in
this
one
almost
like
an
ipa
but
no
citrus
like
flavors
at
all
just
hops
and
rye
of
course
the
rye
seems
to
import
and
dryness
which
is
interesting
given
the
hop
value
here
a
very
nice
decent
brew
somewhat
strong
but
backs
off
a
bit
to
let
you
really
drink
it
a
savory
rendition
of
and
otherwise
in
my
experience
citrus
forward
style
more
on
the
floral
dry
side
and
it
may
be
a
big
who
for
those
that
appreciate
my
dry
almost
salty
ipas
pour
is
like
all
others
ruby
dark
amber
almost
completely
clear
nose
is
floral
with
hints
of
lemon
zest
grapefruit
but
barely
dry
mineral
that
is
expanded
by
a
subtle
sweetness
not
too
dry
that
the
beer
feels
in
to
waves
of
mineral
crisp
with
a
alcohol
that
comes
after
this
beer
is
quite
a
nice
surprise
by
far
the
best
ive
had
from
sixpoint
and
this
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
rye
beers
from
any
brewery
o
very
drinkable
for
me
and
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
what
id
expect
from
the
style
still
i
enjoyed
it
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
a
little
but
otherwise
a
very
clean
feel
dangerously
drinkable
at
6
5
if
you
love
rye
give
it
a
shot
this
is
the
brew
developed
for
the
gods
i
cannot
get
enough
of
the
amber
color
pour
and
rich
thick
head
taste
is
sweet
with
subtle
hoppiness
bitterness
i
can
drink
this
over
and
over
again
excellent
abv
content
a
very
filling
brew
worthy
of
your
salute
cheers
btw
the
finish
is
the
super
star
nice
and
nutty
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
keep
drinking
them
all
night
i
think
the
sour
notes
and
the
woodgrain
here
came
from
the
cask
in
addition
to
the
limited
carbonation
and
heavy
feel
i
think
this
beer
would
suffer
tremendously
with
a
tap
serving
or
bottle
but
on
cask
i
liked
it
just
fine
sixpoint
righteous
rye
is
a
nice
rye
ale
had
on
draft
at
the
abbaye
the
beer
is
a
pretty
good
rye
beer
with
a
bit
of
rye
tang
and
spiciness
but
nothing
great
the
beer
is
hybrid
of
india
pale
and
brown
ales
with
a
hearty
amount
of
rye
added
the
color
was
a
clean
medium
brown
with
good
creamy
lacing
the
beer
had
a
rye
bite
and
citrus
hops
with
an
assertive
bitterness
at
the
end
i
could
drink
this
all
day
i
intentionally
savor
every
sip
as
its
just
great
i
could
and
did
drink
a
few
of
these
over
one
lunch
and
dinner
the
next
day
drink
is
good
but
it
just
lacked
something
to
me
a
kind
of
bland
rye
beer
dgood
stuff
not
just
another
rye
ipa
a
nice
ale
with
a
healthy
addition
of
rye
malt
i
am
sure
sharp
bite
but
yet
very
drinkable
d
one
of
the
few
rye
ales
i
have
had
on
cask
a
very
unique
intense
rye
tast
while
good
i
am
not
sure
i
consider
this
a
drinkable
cask
beer
i
would
prefer
the
regular
draft
version
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
dry
earthy
pine
hops
which
are
quickly
balanced
but
a
very
dry
earthy
pine
bitterness
that
lasts
throughout
over
a
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
bone
dry
finish
hints
of
caramel
malt
with
biscuit
and
rye
very
hoppy
for
the
style
and
not
very
well
balanced
with
a
lot
of
dry
bitterness
completely
overpowering
the
sweet
rye
malt
the
abv
is
decently
masked
and
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
but
the
hops
outshine
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
too
much
for
my
liking
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
rye
ale
i
havent
delved
deep
into
this
style
yet
but
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
stays
in
my
favorites
for
a
while
notes
good
not
great
i
would
have
liked
some
more
carbonation
and
a
little
more
complexity
drinkability
i
am
starting
to
get
into
rye
beers
and
this
is
worth
the
try
but
a
one
and
done
for
me
the
hop
profile
is
in
my
opinion
unbalanced
with
the
rye
which
doesnt
have
a
strong
profile
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
tangy
spicy
open
with
a
rye
and
hop
bitter
middle
as
a
subtle
hint
of
malt
pops
in
oh
so
briefly
so
this
ale
is
a
rye
ale
probably
the
only
notable
rye
ale
i
have
been
fortuante
enough
to
gulp
gulp
gulp
toasty
burnt
tips
charred
bicuit
deep
simmered
grain
alongside
dank
weed
the
hops
buttery
yeast
sticky
residual
sugar
fruit
hops
at
front
hella
malt
on
the
back
end
with
clean
bitterness
jewish
grilled
cheese
and
bod
he
must
work
out
an
n
y
staple
a
rye
the
best
one
you
ever
had
the
best
ryetit
down
sixpoint
craft
ale
good
example
of
type
and
drinkable
for
strong
flavors
still
learning
to
love
the
rye
though
d
very
smooth
and
easy
going
would
definitely
try
some
more
d
very
interesting
and
delicous
at
first
but
lost
its
charm
quickly
ill
have
another
at
some
point
down
the
road
this
is
a
very
good
beer
rye
imparts
a
very
distinct
flavor
to
beer
but
it
is
used
with
many
different
styles
ranging
from
ipas
to
fruitspice
beers
very
refreshing
flavor
with
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
good
dark
copper
color
great
carbonation
great
fry
and
hoppy
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
beer
amber
pour
thin
head
but
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
decided
bready
and
malty
with
some
orangepineapple
citrus
in
there
and
even
some
nuttiness
the
flavor
confirmed
the
aroma
but
was
very
nicely
balanced
starting
with
rye
biscuit
and
maltiness
blending
in
with
some
toffee
and
nuttiness
and
then
ending
on
a
pleasant
mildly
dry
hop
note
the
body
was
medium
and
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
very
good
representative
of
the
style
but
not
quite
hop
rod
rye
d
good
but
not
great
another
sixpoint
brew
thats
just
missing
something
and
has
a
slightly
off
taste
mfd
there
was
basically
no
carbonation
in
the
beer
but
i
assume
that
is
what
happens
when
a
beer
is
casked
the
slight
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
does
nothing
to
hide
the
fully
medium
body
d
i
love
rye
beers
the
few
ive
had
ive
loved
alpine
nelson
br
hot
rod
rye
in
fact
i
havent
had
a
bad
one
yet
i
enjoy
this
style
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
while
not
crisp
righteous
ale
will
fill
the
bill
after
a
long
hard
day
heck
have
a
couple
with
your
buddies
d
gotta
love
the
local
brew
especially
when
they
make
such
a
damn
good
one
its
full
its
complex
its
not
too
aggressive
its
great
some
hop
and
grain
aroma
mahogoney
colour
with
good
head
creamy
mouthfeel
bulked
up
from
caramal
malt
with
chop
taste
and
a

very
good
nice
drinkability
with

ontap
at

at
appropriate
temperature
not
too
cold
d
hoppy
and
dry
with
a
hefty

character
big
on
tosted

and
breads
another
winner
from
six
point
mdmouthfeel
is
biting
and
rocky
and
not
really
smooth
enough
to
balance
out
whatever
lingering
rye
comes
through
drinkability
is
low
because
i
expected
a
rye
beer
to
match
with
food
and
a
rainy
day
but
got
a
hoppy
nearly
amber
ale
think
troegs
hopback
with
some
peppery
notes
instead
oh
wellnot
bad
just
not
true
to
the
style
pours
an
amberred
hue
with
white

builds
down
the
glass
in
a
pleasing
fashion
a
sweet
aroma
with
floral

some

with

characteristics
at
the
finish
leaves
a
slick
aftertaste
on

definitely
a
goto
beer
for
hopheads
and
rye
fanatics
alike

tasted
on

d
solid
rye
beer
with

its
a
hearty
treat
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
d
amazing
beer
all
around
a
totally
different
and
incredible
beer
damn
six
point
for
not
having
their
products
in
albany
d
great
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
drink
a
good
amount
pours
a
dark
amber
mohogony
color
with
an
awesome
head
that
leaves
great
lace
and
has
great
retention
the
aroma
is
so
goddamn
unique
and
awesome
its
super
dry
and
hoppy
smelling
the
taste
is
phenomenal
defintely
the
best
rye
beer
ive
had
its
super
crisp
and
has
a
medium
body
such
an
awesome
combo
mouthfeel
is
robust
and
flavorful
drinkability
is
good
especially
with
pork
beef
and
spicy
food
my
first
beer
from
sixpoint
more
than
satisfied
not
super
complex
but
with
the
almost
inaudible
alcohol
its
scary
had
this
on
tap
at
both
char
4
and
at
back
forty
i
love
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
for
the
abv
its
a
little
dangerous
the
first
sips
reveals
smooth
sweet
malt
and
earthy
rye
with
a
pleasant
hoppy
finish
the
flavor
is
like
a
much
darker
beer
but
the
heavy
carbonation
makes
this
drink
much
lighter
this
worked
really
well
with
the
grub
at
char
4
which
is
smokey
bbq
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
love
how
this
beer
starts
malty
goes
through
that
sour
rye
bitterness
and
finishes
dry
with
the
hops
very
easy
to
drink
really
a
wonderful
brew

this
is
lovely
stuff
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
i
think
it
rivals
all
the
others
ive
tried
highly
recommend
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
rank
it
up
toward
the
top
of
rye
beers
ive
had
highly
recommended
and
crazy
drinkable

great

at

mix
of
ingredients
ryes
and
hops
combine
to
give
a
thick
earthy
flavor
almost
seems
a
touch
like
an
amber
feel
is
thicker
on
liquid
a
bit
and
the
carbonation
is
low
and
smooth
fairly
intense
i
have
to
say
but
another
good
sixpoint
brew
big
ups
to
rblwthacoz
for
hooking
me
up
sixpoint
still
impressed
me
with
this
offering
as
well
and
i
look
forward
to
having
their
future
concoctions
had
this
on
tap
old
bay
restaurant
in
new
brunswick
nj
4
75
for
a
pint
had
a
dark
bronze
color
2
finger
lace
nose
had
hints
of
citrus
pine
had
alot
more
hops
and
bitter
than
most
rye
beers
ive
had
to
compare
it
to
founders
red
rye
it
has
alot
more
bite
but
not
as
balanced
overall
a
very
nice
rye
beer
if
the
hops
storage
continue
this
would
be
a
nice
replacement
for
my
ipa
fix
another
great
brew
from
sixpoint
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
vast
head
that
simply
will
not
quit
almost
down
to
the
last
sip
the
aroma
a
bit
weak
but
the
flavor
is
vast
with
a
huge
rye
taste
and
a
robust
spicy
cherry
character
its
like
a
great
cloud
of
fragrant
cherrywood
tobacco
smoke
there
is
a
deep
hop
bitterness
that
extends
all
the
way
down
your
throat
the
mouthfeel
is
round
and
satisfying
and
will
invite
you
to
keep
drinking
this
is
a
powerfully
drinkable
beer
but
beware
because
it
carries
a
deceptively
stiff
abv
bite
hv
the
carbonation
on
this
on
stays
middle
of
the
road
and
just
right
for
the
brew
this
one
is
thinner
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
but
is
just
right
for
quaffing
at
7
flavor
was
pine
from
the
hops
malt
dry
wood
and
a
small
amount
of
rye
coming
in
at
the
finish
a
decent
beer
overall
tasted
great
coming
out
of
the
cask
feels
chewy
and
a
bit
gritty
really
really
thick
sandpaper
almost
layer
upon
layer
of
challenges
its
merciless
a
unique
brutal
beverage
repeats
are
simply
not
an
option
its
an
onslaught
of
harsh
rye
grain
oak
and
grass
quite
the
hard
drink
the
beer
pours
an
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
caramel
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
and
lots
of
rye
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
tremendously
smooth
taste
that
boasts
of
rye
and
light
caramel
malts
it
goes
down
as
easy
as
any
beer
ive
ever
had
and
its
7
2
to
boot
its
got
a
really
nice
hop
content
that
blends
well
with
the
rye
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
its
dangerously
drinkable
at
7
2
look
out
for
this
one
recommended
i
enjoyed
this
ale
on
cask
via
the
handpump
at
the
spotted
pig
the
barman
was
a
bit
rough
well
overly
so
and
it
was
a
bit
less
carbonated
than
it
should
have
been
it
was
delivered
with
a
thin
layer
of
creamy
bonewhite
froth
over
the
hazy
copper
body
below
clear
notes
of
rye
appeared
in
the
nose
along
with
notes
of
maltysweet
dark
caramel
hops
appeared
grassy
floral
and
even
piney
or
was
that
the
influence
of
the
rye
crossing
over
regardless
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
definitely
appears
in
the
flavor
and
it
finishes
with
dark
lingering
caramel
and
spice
very
nice
a
richly
flavored
slowdrinking
pint
d
this
is
a
suberb
beer
and
was
way
over
my
expectations
to
go
with
the
sixpoint
ipa
i
had
last
week
im
really
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
and
i
hope
they
are
all
as
delicious
as
this
one
had
on
tap
at
buks
in
cambridge
nice
chestnut
red
color
with
creamy
white
head
tons
of
lacing
nice
floral
hop
aroma
solid
flavor
of
bitter
hops
smoothed
out
as
you
drink
good
balance
with
a
grainy
malty
finish
a
very
drinkable
7
beer
can
not
wait
to
try
more
of
their
beers
i
am
very
much
looking
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
after
not
having
a
beer
for
a
while
this
was
great
way
to
return
with
pints
from
a
fresh
pin
of
righteous
rye
with
a
bunch
of
friends
this
evening
in
rocky
point
ny
we
were
at
deks
american
which
had
a
pin
sitting
on
the
bar
and
we
were
drawing
healthy
pints
for
the
crowd
this
ambergold
ale
really
had
an
interesting
taste
that
i
felt
was
a
vast
improvement
over
the
regular
tap
version
bearing
the
marks
of
a
sixpoint
ale
with
the
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
there
was
a
slight
cream
taste
matched
by
the
twang
of
the
rye
malt
it
was
easy
to
drink
if
one
already
knew
to
expect
something
different
than
what
memory
served
about
rye
ales
toasted
malt
bready
rye
again
with
a
hoppy
finish
aftertaste
carries
the
rye
spiciness
for
a
little
while
fairly
fullbodied
similar
in
feel
to
some
german
dunkels
theres
a
good
presence
of
yeast
as
well
possibly
accounting
for
the
apple
in
the
aroma
some
mild
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
its
hidden
well
its
pretty
hearty
but
still
very
drinkable
a
success
dyet
another
winner
from
sixpoint
this
is
one
well
balanced
beer
that
provides
a
good
hop
fix
tmd
more
rye
than
i
expected
i
was
kinda
expecting
a
rye
pale
ale
but
this
thing
has
a
big
rye
flavor
medium
thick
body
and
a
big
round
fullness
spicy
hops
to
balance
the
malts
easy
to
drink
so
easy
i
had
two
great
stuff
sixpoint
so
far
has
not
disappointed
me
highly
recommended
smoothcreamy
mouthfeel
very
reminiscent
of
a
nut
brown
with
muted
sweet
malts
leading
off
alongside
loads
of
cashewpeanut
herbaceous
grassiness
appears
towards
midsip
and
lingers
into
the
finish
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
an
appealing
though
unassuming
ale
poured
into
a
chalice
reddish
brown
with
nexttono
head
its
from
a
cask
little
carbonation
smells
enchanting
bitter
hops
toasted
caramel
malts
spices
and
rye
tastes
much
the
same
rich
toasty
malts
and
the
sweetness
is
nicely
complemented
by
a
hop
bite
and
the
rye
spice
goes
down
very
smooth
for
the
abv
well
done
boys
well
done
this
is
my
favorite
sixpoint
ale
as
well
as
my
favorite
rye
beer
if
you
have
the
opportunity
this
is
a
musthave
very
well
done
a
very
nice
rye
beer
for
a
hard
to
find
style
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
nice
cloudy
brownish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
two
finger
creamy
tan
head
which
last
awhile
nice
islands
and
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hops
some
rye
slight
spices
and
caramel
the
taste
is
mostly
malts
and
rye
slightly
spicy
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
i
can
taste
the
rye
but
not
a
whole
lot
just
a
difference
from
the
maltshops
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
lightmedium

well
balanced
brew
drinkable
a
nice
brew
from
sixpoint
mf
and
d
dry

very
drinkable
nice
carbonation
fullbodied
very
pleasing
experience
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
bitter
and
semidry
in
the
finish
from
the
rye
addition
d
its
tasty
but
the
taste
didnt
really
appeal
to
me
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
really
didnt
like
it
and
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
the
pint
overall
a
very
drinkable
rye
beer
excellent
but
not
overpoweringly
spicy
good
hidden
abv
as
well
medium
bodied
firm
overall
very
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
a
superb
beer
sixpoint
has
done
it
again
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
nicely
drinkable
beer
it
smells
of
hops
the
hop
backbone
is
there
in
the
taste
and
the
funky
rye
is
a
very
nice
compliment
it
is
a
bit
bready
due
to
the
abv
and
the
accompanying
sweetness
but
the
alcohol
is
not
overtly
present
musings
this
beer
is
like
cutting
into
a
crusty
loaf
of
artisnal
bread
right
out
of
the
oven
so
fresh
and
full
of
life
one
of
the
most
friendly
brews
you
will
find
very
murky
brown
color
the
top
12
of
the
glass
has
a
darker
tint
still
moderate
amount
of
lace
smell
is
woody
and
pinelike
taste
is
sweet
upfront
but
fairly
balanced
with
a
hoppy
bite
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
a
realpalate
cleansing
effervescence
to
it
this
is
another
quite
tasty
offering
from
sixpoint
unfortunately
its
just
not
extremely
drinkable
due
to
the
fairly
high
abv
and
this
style
inherently
is
not
real
sessionable
even
if
it
had
a
lower
abv
cloudy
like
a
rainstorm
with
a
reddishbrown
glow
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
murky
and
foreboding
like
the
red
sky
before
said
storm
continents
made
of
foam
wisps
lie
still
on
the
surface
hardcore
walls
of
lacing
take
hold
of
the
glass
inner
sanctum
smells
brilliantly
of
piney
pine
cone
hoppiness
and
freshly
baked
pumpernickel
bread
not
quite
rye
although
a
cracked
pepper
spiciness
permeates
my
nasal
cavity
bold
is
an
understatement
here
for
this
strong
aroma
once
this
beer
enters
my
mouth
i
can
feel
the
hops
physically
super
hoppy
with
a
nice
rye
tang
in
the
finish
licoricelike
bitter
spice
and
lemon
rind
abounds
crisp
and
crippling
malt
really
lays
back
as
the
botanical
richness
and
peppery
accents
rule
robust
yet
extremely
quaffable
its
just
delicious
and
rich
without
heaviness
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
grapenuts
and
continues
to
perplex
me
this
beer
is
a
crazy
funky
beer
bomb
use
with
caution
but
extremely
effective
and
tasty
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
frothy
cavernous
off
white
head
easily
agitated
back
strong
body
smelled
of
rye
spice
and
hay
taste
was
a
great
combo
of
rich
malt
spicy
prickly
rye
and
this
barnyard
sort
of
grain
funk
beautiful
balance
complex
flavors
highly
drinkable
very
quenching
full
bodied
with
a
little
tickle
leaves
the
palate
dry
wanting
more
everything
about
this
beer
left
me
wanting
more
a
rockin
and
unique
brew
dont
pass
up
on
this
one
an
enjoyable
beer
that
drinks
well
and
has
all
of
the
flavors
nicely
balanced
the
malt
and
hop
balance
is
quite
well
done
with
each
inntial
bitter
sip
balanced
by
a
semisweet
maltiness
well
done
poured
a
hazy
and
dense
looking
coppery
color
big
foamy
head
on
top
of
this
beer
nose
was
slightly
rye
but
it
struck
me
as
more
hoppier
the
flavor
was
also
less
rye
than
i
thought
there
would
be
with
a
nice
kick
of
hops
however
between
the
hops
and
the
rye
there
was
a
nice
bitterness
to
this
beer
little
bits
of
lighter
fruit
want
and
try
to
break
throughbut
they
are
no
more
than
hints
slightly
dry
finish
and
fairly
oily
feel
i
like
rye
beers
a
lot
and
they
seem
to
be
few
and
far
between
so
i
tend
to
seek
them
out
when
i
see
them
on
the
menu
had
this
on
tap
at
the
sunset
the
other
day
and
it
blew
me
away
poured
in
a
tulip
this
american
brew
really
has
a
belgian
vibe
about
it
which
is
odd
given
the
style
nice
murky
russet
color
and
an
excellent
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
rings
of
lacing
this
is
an
awesomely
complex
beer
super
spicy
full
of
rye
character
and
peppery
notes
also
some
sweet
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
or
maybe
even
clove
i
never
thought
id
say
this
about
any
beer
but
i
was
sort
of
reminded
of
a
fantome
saison
because
of
the
sweetspicy
characteristics
a
lot
like
the
spicing
in
their
hiver
or
printemps
or
something
excellent
also
its
got
a
really
bitter
hop
kick
towards
the
end
with
a
great
bone
dry
yet
somehow
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
im
definately
getting
this
again
and
highly
recommend
it
this
righteous
rye
beer
poured
a
cloudy
coffee
brown
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
lightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
sourness
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
lightly
sour
citrusy
flavor
together
with
an
underlying
very
light
sweetness
there
was
good
rye
maltiness
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
overall
with
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
aftertaste
and
feel
were
dry
this
was
a
good
rye
beer
and
the
alcohol
content
was
well
hidden
nice
beer
uf
this
is
very
good
on
draft
i
had
it
on
cask
prior
to
this
and
didnt
get
to
take
notes
to
review
it
but
it
was
even
better
had
on
tap
over
this
past
weekend
at
the
sunset
ive
had
good
luck
with
rye
beers
and
this
one
was
no
exception
turgid
brown
when
served
came
topped
with
some
frothy
white
head
surprisingly
low
aroma
perhaps
some
malt
and
yeastiness
tastewise
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
malty
slightly
sweet
small
tingly
carbonation
i
found
it
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
had
only
one
glass
during
this
sitting
due
to
the
abv
one
interesting
note
i
thought
there
was
some
sweetness
to
this
one
but
others
at
the
table
commented
that
they
picked
up
on
some
sourness
thats
why
i
enjoy
drinking
with
other
bas
hearing
the
different
takes
on
a
beer
another
good
one
from
the
sixpoint
crew
and
is
an
offering
i
would
pick
up
in
a
heartbeat
the
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
has
a
creamyness
to
it
and
good
retention
the
aroma
of
sweet
malts
citrusy
hops
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
caramely
and
spicy
with
the
bitterness
of
hops
and
the
crispness
of
the
rye
at
the
end
i
want
to
say
it
has
a
background
of
oak
but
i
dont
know
if
my
pallette
is
that
in
tune
yet
the
rye
beer
and
the
belgian
yeast
really
compliment
each
other
on
this
an
all
around
good
beer
drinkability
wow
this
is
one
terrific
and
unusual
beer
first
time
i
have
had
anything
from
sixpoint
but
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
them
the
next
time
i
am
in
their
territory
this
beer
deserves
a
better
rating
then
an
83
if
you
warm
it
up
a
little
you
get
a
variety
of
tastes
a
malt
profile
that
has
a
scotch
ale
thing
only
with
rye
theres
a
nice
caramel
taste
that
fuses
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
peppery
rye
taste
the
pepper
corns
add
a
lot
of
heat
that
coats
the
roof
of
you
mouth
for
me
this
is
a
delightful
treat
pretty
interesting
beer
the
malt
profile
seems
a
bit
lackluster
but
it
gets
better
in
complexity
if
you
let
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
food
pairing
with
steak
grilled
meats
etc
i
will
probably
buy
it
again
but
it
will
most
likely
be
to
pair
with
a
meal
rather
than
drinking
as
a
standalone
beer
while
its
not
my
favorite
style
of
all
time
this
beer
works
well
for
what
it
is
worth
a
try
i
recommand
it
not
really
my
style
of
choice
tough
to
drink
the
pepper
and
spice
are
very
very
prominent
im
a
fan
of
spicy
beer
and
this
a
solid
one
albeit
it
can
be
overpowering
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
pepper
the
peppercorns
are
right
upfront
front
smell
and
taste
add
to
that
some
caramel
and
some
distant
chocolate
strong
malt
flavor
did
not
detect
the
rye
or
fruit
as
the
label
implies
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
certainly
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
given
the
aroma
of
the
beer
it
definitely
wasnt
a
classic
but
i
did
enjoy
the
spiciness
to
it
and
its
fairly
unique
flavours
while
its
not
a
beer
im
likely
to
pick
up
again
it
is
one
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
very
spicy
one
at
that
earthy
spice
pepper
rye
sweetness
very
interresting
and
fun
beer
different
than
any
other
rye
a
must
have
in
my
opinion
ruby
good
lacing
quite
a
strong
rye
component
and
a
spicy
beer
good
balance
light
hops
but
a
rich
earthy
peppery
character
good
drinkability
and
balance
not
something
i
would
have
regularly
but
this
was
enjoyable
a
very
good
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
overall
this
is
probably
the
first
dissapointing
ddc
beer
i
have
ever
had
food
match
the
gingerness
of
this
brew
made
me
think
of
dishes
with
ginger
such
as
the
burmese
gyin
thot
and
the
thai
gai
pad
king
now
i
have
ginger
on
the
brain
its
been
nearly
5
years
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
there
have
been
changes
in
either
the
beer
my
palate
or
both
this
was
fondly
remembered
as
a
very
tasty
treat
from
the
exotic
land
of
quebec
now
i
find
this
to
be
an
ok
beer
lacking
nose
and
appearance
but
still
being
spicy
now
it
seems
meh
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
a
reddish
coppery
bronze
color
with
a
moderate
amount
of
beige
head
smells
quite
sweet
but
with
an
equal
measure
of
earthy
spice
toffee
musty
seed
spice
rye
bread
earthy
hops
one
can
tell
right
away
that
there
is
a
rich
maltiness
almost
like
a
scotch
ale
couple
with
some
savory
spice
and
herb
flavors
indeed
the
initial
taste
is
like
raisin
rye
bread
sprinkled
with
black
pepper
a
dry
almost
salty
leather
note
emerges
over
time
along
with
sour
apple
caramel
candies
and
tobacco
the
heat
from
the
black
pepper
builds
over
time
with
the
rather
dry
finish
evoking
peppered
crackers
and
providing
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
sweet
beginning
and
middle
sections
moderate
body
like
many
red
ales
and
pretty
smooth
i
am
hard
to
pressed
to
complain
about
anything
here
theres
a
rummy
sweetness
a
woody
peppercorn
bite
and
some
tangy
fruit
elements
that
all
cleave
together
nicely
great
example
of
the
skilled
use
of
spices
in
brewing
even
if
you
can
indeed
taste
the
pepper
as
such
felt
like
a
brown
ale
made
with
rye
with
a
pepper
time
bomb
quite
interesting
beer
it
should
perfectly
match
with
cold
cuts
or
steak
stay
away
if
you
dont
like
spices
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
that
certainly
deserves
revisiting
with
food
esp
charcuterie
it
is
drinkable
wellcrafted
and
balanced
well
enough
that
the
peppercorns
dont
overwhelm
or
the
malt
doesnt
muddle
the
clean
spice
flavor
really
like
this
one
and
i
would
say
that
it
was
worth
the
high
price
tag
to
try
it
o
just
a
great
beer
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
would
consider
buying
some
more
some
bbqd
chicken
would
be
great
with
this
a
few
seconds
later
the
tongue
tingles
with
the
bite
of
freshly
ground
black
pepper
and
the
bite
leaves
a
tingle
for
a
good
while
on
the
tongue
in
this
sense
its
a
very
interesting
flavor
giving
it
a
slight
bump
from
being
a
solid
midlevel
beer
its
alright
but
not
exceptional
if
you
ask
me
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
but
i
doubt
i
would
order
it
low
orangey
wispy
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
opaque
orangey
red
colored
rich
aroma
of
ripe
fruit
and
dark
bread
flavor
of
ripe
apricot
and
plum
bready
malt
semisweet
no
hop
flavors
a
peppery
bite
slowly
builds
subtle
but
noticeable
just
the
right
amount
starts
in
the
back
of
the
throat
slowly
moves
up
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
rolls
down
to
the
tip
keeping
the
mouth
warm
despite
the
low
abv
low
carbonation
semi
slick
but
the
heat
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
a
quaffer
the
pepper
does
build
up
with
time
making
this
a
spicy
sipper
but
i
like
it
i
didnt
find
it
as
overbearing
as
many
reviewers
found
perhaps
theyve
toned
it
down
in
later
batches
the
beer
underneath
it
all
does
a
fine
job
too
overall
a
decent
brew
the
peppercorns
really
take
over
and
kick
the
palates
ass
takes
over
the
brew
too
much
to
be
a
really
truly
great
brew
o
very
flavorful
rye
beer
and
id
try
this
again
overall
exceptional
love
it
would
go
superb
with
food
pairing
memorable
the
smell
and
taste
dont
match
odd
but
not
a
bad
thing
its
certainly
an
interesting
beer
more
for
matching
with
food
than
drinking
alone
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
the
amount
of
pepper
in
it
forces
it
to
feel
like
a
bit
of
a
gimmick
not
something
i
can
imagine
anybody
drinking
a
lot
of
not
having
very
often
that
being
said
i
rather
like
it
overall
better
in
a
more
aromatic
glass
but
a
delicious
rye
beer
d
i
guess
a
redeeming
quality
here
is
that
this
beer
is
at
least
interesting
but
thats
about
it
poor
balance
oddly
constructed
and
just
doesnt
taste
good
dp
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
i
do
plan
on
trying
this
again
from
its
darker
nutty
notes
from
the
darker
grains
used
when
brewing
to
its
spicy
rye
it
is
an
interesting
beer
to
at
least
try
o
i
enjoy
pepper
in
general
and
pepperyspiced
beers
like
rye
porters
this
beer
is
simply
too
peppery
strong
for
my
tastes
thus
keeping
the
feel
and
taste
ratings
in
check
this
beer
starts
out
very
smooth
easy
drinking
satisfying
as
it
warms
it
gets
more
complex
the
peppercorns
start
to
shine
through
and
it
really
gets
interesting
for
a
5
00
beer
this
is
way
more
than
a
session
beer
with
mild
abv
its
a
really
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
will
have
again
and
again
if
you
like
rye
beers
peppery
wines
or
just
complex
ales
in
general
give
this
a
try
o
good
drinkability
great
spicy
beer
unique
experience
overall
this
is
going
to
be
a
love
or
hate
beer
for
most
people
the
only
things
spicier
than
this
are
going
to
be
beers
with
actual
chilies
in
there
overall
its
a
good
rye
beer
but
youll
only
enjoy
it
if
you
like
or
at
least
appreciate
the
overwhelming
pepper
character
it
has
overall
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
any
of
this
brewers
offerings
they
are
always
original
and
unique
in
style
never
had
one
quite
like
this
like
a
swig
of
rye
pale
ale
with
a
fat
bite
of
steak
au
poivre
brewed
with
green
and
black
peppercorns
this
is
one
interesting
sip
pours
dense
and
milky
brown
in
color
slight
amber
hue
to
it
definitely
full
bodied
with
a
fluffy
just
off
white
head
the
nose
is
really
bitey
from
the
peppercorns
which
increases
even
more
as
it
warms
there
is
also
a
full
dose
of
rye
malt
in
here
which
only
adds
to
the
spicy
nose
flavor
is
great
and
unique
its
peppery
as
hell
almost
hot
in
the
finish
but
its
highly
refined
as
well
carefully
dosed
and
i
think
they
walked
the
line
here
without
crossing
it
i
could
have
drank
another
bottle
of
this
without
issue
the
rye
has
a
ton
of
body
and
exacerbates
the
pepper
intensity
i
love
the
combination
never
had
one
like
this
before
at
all
not
aware
of
another
out
there
really
creamy
feel
in
texture
but
with
quite
bold
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
you
can
keep
on
tasting
for
awhile
after
you
swallow
the
pepper
just
keeps
coming
i
can
think
of
about
a
million
food
combinations
id
like
to
serve
this
beer
with
highly
recommended
pepper
very
nice
pepper
taste
a
bit
of
pepper
in
the
aroma
but
really
hits
you
at
the
end
of
the
palate
really
nice
copper
color
fairly
dry
descent
mouthfeel
nice
different
beer
pepper
is
not
over
powering
definately
taste
it
but
complements
beer
nicely
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wish
it
had
more
powerful
carbonation
i
think
that
would
play
nicely
with
the
peppercorns
overall
kind
of
a
strange
beer
bought
it
on
a
whim
its
good
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
anytime
soon
served

redorange
with
a

finger
very
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
earth
pepper
and
orange
peel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
earth
earth
hop
and
orange
peel
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
really
wish
this
brew
had
quite
a
bit
more
complexity
to
it
there
were
some
good
notes
going
on
here
with
the
orange
peel
but
it
just
wasnt
enough
to
make
it
stand
out
in
the
style
if
it
just
had
a
little
more
going
on
it
could
have
been
a
pretty
good
brew
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
at

of

and
im
pretty
sure
no
one
orders
more
than
one
pint
of
this
per
evening
however
this
smelled
sweet
for
an
ipa
with
a
fair
amount
of
rye
spice
and
a
slight
minerally
character
the
nose
as
a
whole
was
relatively
subdued
everything
seemed
muted
nothing
jumped
out
the
taste
is
well
balanced
lots
of
rye
spice
sticky
sweet
malts
earthy
peppercorns
some
grapefruit
hop
notes
mild
lingering
bitterness
but
still
getting
the
same
mineral
qualities
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
resembles
a
bigger
ipa
relatively
full
bodied
somewhat
sticky
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
good
but
just
didnt
hold
up
to
any
of
the
other
vermont
and
massachusetts
ipas
consumed
that
night
lacks
depth
but
generally
tasty
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
baby
is
its
only
available
during
the
winter
time
sad
because
while
consuming
it
i
had
pleasant
thoughts
of
sitting
on
a
back
deck
in
the
summer
drinking
a
cold
one
of
these
one
of
the
most
refreshing
adult
drinks
ive
ever
had
wicked
tangerine
but
a
bit
heavy
on
the
mineral
overall
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
my
wife
picked
it
out

finally
try

into

pours
a
slightly
opaque
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
and
lots
of

as
it
sits
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
more
so
than
most
ipas
smells
of
apple
and
grapefruit
mostly
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
maybe
the
taste
is
nothing
special
very
piney
at
first
with
a
finishing
of
the
rye
used
mouth
feel
is
fine
slightly
thinner
than
i
like
and
more
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
ipa
i
really
enjoy
the
aroma
think
i
would
enjoy
it
more
off
a
tap
would
have
again

o
a
very
strong
rye
presence
that
lives
up
to
its
name
with
an
equally
good
dry
hopped
backing
o
c
continues
to
step
up
their
hop
game
and
is
becoming
a
force
with
a
expanding
portfolio
of
sought
after
hoppy
beers
this
is
very
good

worthy
and
the

factor
is
something
to

a

one
for
a
nonipa
fan
to

as
a

some
of
ocs
stuff
has
been
hit
or

for
me
i
would
call
this
one
a

without

o
plenty
here
for

lovers
with
a
nice
rye
twist
not
as
balanced
as
id
like
too
bitter
but
allinall
a
wellmade
and
tasty
brew
this
beer
is
surprising
i
didnt
care
for
ocs
overgrown
this
beer
however
definitely
deserves
the
outstanding
rating
its
receiving
its
an
excellent
ipa
to
give
to
a
buddy
if
you
want
them
to
get
into
craft
and
ipas
o
a
nice
rye
ipa
definitely
will
seek
out
again
another
winner
from

some
noticeable
suspended
particles
and
a

a
fresh
hoppy
scent
leads
to
a
mouthful
of
fruit
pineapple
and
berry
i
think
theres
a
hint
of
clove
in
there
too
the
malts
balance
out
a
long
bitter
finish
yum
well
done
ill
have
another
overall
a
good
rye
ale
solid
beer
just
wasnt
a
favorite
very
good
stuff
if
i
had
a
bucket
full
this
might
get
assbumped
into
the
excellent
sphere
another
fine
brew
from
otter
creek
o
maybe
not
as
exciting
or
standout
as
the
many
really
great
ipas
of
today
but
this
serves
as
a
great
example
of
a
ryepa
they
dont
shy
away
from
emphasizing
the
rye
and
it
interplays
with
a
nice
hop
profile
the
pour
is
radiant
orange
with
a
decent
head
and
limited
clarity
an
average
amount
of
lacing
remains
on
the
glass
after
consumption
the
smell
is
black
pepper
lemon
and
grass
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
with
additional
notes
of
citrus
pumpernickel
grain
and
spice
while
not
the
biggest
fan
of
rye
ipas
i
do
enjoy
the
kick
this
one
provides
the
finish
is
semidry
and
very
bitter
but
im
not
complaining
reasonably
executed
d
this
had
a
nicely
balanced
scent
and
taste
with
decent
body
solid
brew
even
if
not
super
unique
or
exiting
drinking
this
right
now
for
the
first
time
on
draught
at
a
bar
in
baltimore
this
is
absolutely
delicious
as
a
selfdescribed
hop
head
id
begun
to
wonder
whether
anything
under
8
would
satisfy
my
admittedly
overwrought
taste
buds
but
at
only
6
5
this
delivers
loads
of
flavor
id
love
to
regale
you
with
all
the
flavor
nuances
but
ill
leave
that
to
the
folks
who
can
actually
wax
poetic
about
that
stuff
all
i
know
is
that
this
is
an
exceptional
ipa
that
delivers
loads
of
wonderful
hop
flavor
love
it
first
try
of
a
rye
beer
ive
had
better
ipas
from
oc
in
the
past
taste
wasnt
bad
the
rye
goes
quick
into
a
dry
ipa
aftertaste
so
you
dont
get
the
full
flavor
of
some
of
the
best
out
there
overall
good
solid
ipa
that
in
my
opinion
could
have
been
great
if
the
look
lasted
longer
and
the
dry
aftertaste
had
been
a
bit
more
prominent
allinall
a
quality
ipa
that
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
good
beer
i
like
what
the
rye
does
to
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
nice
dryness
only
qualm
was
the
appearance
of
noticeable
floaters
or
proteins
in
suspension
couldnt
realy
notice
their
impact
on
flavor
or
mouthfeel
etc
so
otherwise
excellent
nice
rye
ipa
here
really
nice
tropical
fruit
flavors
followed
with
a
spicy
rye
finish
it
has
a
good
body
but
not
much
head
retention
good
quality
beer
so
dank
so
flavorful
my
favorite
offering
from
otter
creak
very
nice
rye
ale
seems
otter
creeks
seasonal
offerings
are
all
solid
nowadays
this
is
a
solid
rye
ipa
there
is
a
distinct
rye
flavor
right
on
the
first
sip
with
a
hoppy
finish
not
too
over
the
top
hoppy
but
a
good
flavor
for
the
ipa
enthusiast
definitely
a
good
beer
tastes
good
has
some
floating
o

i
love
the

o
otter

is
on
the
mark
with
this
beer
it
has
a
great
flavor
and
balance
with
a
good
hit
of
spiciness
taste
is
clean
and
fresh
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
dank
wet
heavy
spicy
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
things
otter
creek
has
done
a
bit
of
a
standout
from
their
normally
good
but
very
balanced
beer
portfolio
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
great
super
piney
resin
with
a
very
mild
hint
of
citrus
and
its
consistent
thats
the
most
interesting
part
as
most
beers
fade
quickly
on
the
fragrance
aspect
of
things
as
far
as
the
flavor
goes
its
pretty
decent
mildly
full
and
it
follows
through
a
nice
ipa
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
punch
but
it
works
at
two
months
old
this
ipa
still
has
plenty
of
hop
character
and
the
malt
is
not
overpowering
very
tasty
good
balance
and
an
interesting
hop
profile
o
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
rye
as
the
citrus
bitter
and
spicy
flavors
all
complement
each
other
sold
rye
ipa
reasonably
priced
six
pack
widely
available
worth
trying
if
you
like
a
spicy
rye
note
which
is
not
for
everyone
overall
a
really
well
done
beer
by
otter
creek
very
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
have
another
i
dont
know
if
otter
creek
was
holding
back
on
us
or
if
they
learned
a
lot
from
sean
lawson
while
making
double
dose
dont
care
if
they
keep
making
beers
like
this
and
at
this
price
i
will
buy
the
shit
out
them
medium
body
with
dry
earthy
bitterness
lingering
over
sweet
citrustropical
fruit
notes
and
a
faint
pale
malt
backbone
into
a
sweet
slightly
dry
finish
some
grassy
pine
needle
spruce
tip
and
sticky
resinous
oils
countered
by
prominent
fruit
sweetness
and
pale
biscuit
malt
the
juicy
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
notes
really
stand
out
with
hints
of
juicy
grapefruit
mango
pineapple
curaçao
and
blood
orange
the
sweet
clementine
naval
orange
and
tangerine
notes
are
strongest
providing
the
hop
profile
with
delicious
flavor
perfectly
balanced
by
a
pale
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
biscuit
cracker
a
touch
of
spicy
rye
and
subtle
caramel
sweetness
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
earthy
bitterness
but
is
otherwise
an
excellently
balanced
flavorful
beer
that
is
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
ipa
i
really
hope
this
makes
it
to
yearround
rotation
if
not
it
is
officially
my
favorite
winter
ipa
release
imo
better

rye
malts
compliment
the
juicy
tropical
and
pine
hop
flavor
nicely
another
above
average
ipa
coming
out
of
vermont
and
the
north
east
soon
it
seems
like
the
ipa
market
will
reach
saturation
easily
one
of
the
better
if
more
enjoyable
rye
hop
heavy
beers
ive
had
update
13015
bought
another
twelvepack
when
it
came
out
this
month
and
its
a
hoppy
treat
more
than
half
of
the
twelver
already
gone
and
ive
enjoyed
them
all
this
will
be
an
annual
12
pack
buy
for
me
for
as
long
as
its
made
and
im
drinking
o
am
starting
to
become
a
fan
of
rye
beers
and
this
is
a
good
one
good
amount
of
rye
and
hops
which
feature
a
very
unique
flavor
recommended
o
a
solid
showing
from
a
brewery
im
not
that
fond
of
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
some
of
the
really
great
ipas
ive
had
the
good
fortune
to
imbibe
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
i
might
pick
up
in
the
future
at
the
right
price
mouthfeel
is
really
good
great
carbonation
level
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
feel
the
whole
way
through
not
really
smooth
but
a
nice
natural
sweetjuicyfruityearthy
feel
with
a
nice
sharp
dry
bitter
finish
drinkability
is
ridiculous
on
this
beer
this
review
was
actually
2
12
oz
bottles
because
its
so
easy
drinking
goes
quicker
than
anticipated
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
its
great
both
ways
otter
creek
and
long
trail
have
been
killing
it
recently
the
orange
citrus
notes
are
also
abundant
in
the
flavor
but
the
rye
grains
attack
from
the
rear
in
cahoots
with
a
sweet
melted
caramel
army
the
sweetness
is
remarkable
for
an
ipa
but
not
offputting
i
could
drink
this
one
often
and
regularly
this
is
a
decent
effort
but
it
is
not
a
top
tier
rye
beer
a
nice
hazy
pineapple
colored
body
2
fingers
worth
of
very
creamy
foam
smothers
the
sides
and
drips
down
retention
is
average
though
smell
of
spicy
rye
with
grapefruit
is
nice
flavor
is
very
mellow
rye
and
hops
are
subdued
and
mild
finish
is
relatively
tame
ok
but
expected
more
flavor
overall
pretty
nice
great
hop
profile
without
going
overboard
nice
balance
malts
are
there
nicely
enough
to
give
you
a
nice
base
without
even
getting
remotely
in
the
way
of
the
hops
quite
tasty
and
still
drinkable
one
of
their
best
beers
yet
nice
over
all
ryepa
sticks
out
more
as
a
smooth
session
brew
than
a
mind
boggling
taste
buster
the
rye
was
less
predominant
still
was
a
great
session
brew
overall
really
well
executed
rye
and
citrus
elements
some
strawberry
and
watermelon
starts
to
emerge
too
crisp
and
refreshing
would
definitely
enjoy
again
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
better
choices
in
the
style
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
its
a
pretty
stellar
ipa
more
importantly
very
drinkable
and
less
than
10
bucks
a
six
pack
may
grab
it
again
if
i
get
the
chance
o
very
solid
beer
recommended
nothing
particularly
standing
out
just
generally
enjoyable
the
rye
is
nice
in
this
beer
and
works
well
with
the
choice
of
hops

with
an

being
prickly
and
a

that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary

overall
a
pretty
solid
rye
beer
i
have
to
say
that
i
like
the
direction
that
otter
creek
has
been
moving
in
recently
o
this
is
a
really
great
beer
its
a
blast
of
hops
and
flavor
im
still
not
exactly
sure
what
rye
tastes
like
but
i
like
it
reminds
of
harpoons
ipa
and
stone
ipa
for
whatever
thats
worth
highly
recommended
especially
fresh
overall
pretty
good
but
more
so
a
west
coast
ipa
and
lacking
in
the
rye
packs
a
pretty
strong
bitter
hop
punch
but
not
the
most
balanced
beer
out
there
a
little
simple
flavor
but
done
well
enough
to
recommend
giving
it
a
try
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is

is

a
clingy
filmy
offwhite

of
citrus

with
orange
and
tangerine
and
a
solid
caramel
backbone
with
a
rich
and
bitter
toasted
grain
highlight
throughout
smells
great
flavors
of
tangy
sweet
and
bitter
forward
well
blended
with
a
spicy
profile
or
pepper
oregano
and
cedar
notes
good
citrus
blend
providing
tart
notes
throughout
the
body
is
light
and
slightly
effervesced
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
rich
sweet
undertones
with
spicy
hops
overlay
frothy
effervesced
finish
with
a
bitter
and
slightly
dry
linger
solid
and
very
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
wish
both
the
hops
and
rye
were
more
prominent
especially
the
rye
but
its
a
solid
effort
from
otter
creek
hrd
to
rate
because
id
like
to
know
if
the
brewer
intends
for
it
to
be
more
of
an
ipa
or
more
of
just
a
rye
beer
it
works
better
as
an
ipa
less
so
as
a
rye
focused
beer
the
sticker
on
the
bottle
is
cool
beans
this
ipa
is
great
you
can
smell
and
taste
the
hops
right
out
the
bottle
this
beer
should
definitely
be
rated
higher
i
think
otter
creek
nail
it
with
this
one
the
hops
linger
in
your
mouth
im
bios
when
it
comes
to
ipas
but
this
is
just
a
good
beer
to
have
cheers
appears
a
clouded
golden
copper

a

aroma
has
citrus
bursts
apricot
hints
of
mango
hints
of
biscuit
malt
and
dry
yeast
components
lets
see
how
it
tastes
bitter
bitter
and
oh
yeah
bitter
a
wave
of
hops
big
bitterness
lacks
cohesiveness
with
a
malt
profile
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
in
the
backend
but
more
or
less
a
wave
of
hops
and
finishes
with
bitter
resins
and
dry
yeast
notes
bottled
102813
they
have
a
bit
of
time
on
them
but
i
think
these
bottles
are
just
a
bit
over
the
top
with
dry
hop
bitterness
lacks
malt
sweetness
and
balance
there
is
the
spicy
rye
grassiness
that
only
adds
to
the
earthy
bitterness
and
vegetal
garliconion
notes
im
getting
its
like
chewing
on
an
everything
bagel
at
this
point
mouthfeel
completely
drying
bitterness
my
mouth
is
a
desert
waves
of
lingering
bitterness
ample
soft
carbonation
resinous
medium
bodied
ale
overall
i
appreciate
the
hops
but
this
cat
who
used
to
brew
at
dfh
needs
to
go
do
an
internship
on
the
west
coast
to
learn
how
to
tame
the
hops
or
keep
brewing
collaborations
with
lawsons
finest
o
ipas
are
my
favorite
and
this
is
one
is
no
joke
otter
creek
came
out
of
nowhere
with
this
beer
and
i
hope
they
keep
up
the
good
work
solid
as
good
as
a
rye
ipa
can
get
otter
creek
seems
to
be
stepping
their
game
up
o
a
solid
if
unremarkable
ipa
that
is
slightly
elevated
by
the
excellent
rye
finish
but
that
falls
short
of
outstanding
due
to
the
muted
nose
and
overall
average
body
and
flavor
id
snag
it
again
on
tap
to
see
if
my
bottle
was
old
as
there
was
no
visible
date
stamp
o
i
am
not
a
big
drinker
of
rye
ales
but
this
was
a
nice
beer
obviously
a
rye
ipa
which
may
or
may
not
work
for
some
there
is
a
rustic
feel
to
the
ale
as
well
as
a
hoppy
ipa
character
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
but
for
my
tastes
not
a
style
i
hanker
for
often
deliberate
rye
spiciness
with
floral
hops
and
dry
grapefruity
citrus
toasty
but
soft
as
this
works
better
than
most
red
ales
with
similar
characteristics
almost
perfectly
sudsy
an
impeccable
feel
from
a
medium
swish
body
and
the
texture
of
gulping
retained
head
foam
on
big
sips
tastes
great
with
a
keen
hoppiness
and
solid
rye
showing
slightly
tealike
very
easy
to
quaff
what
a
superb
rye
beer
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
good
id
get
it
in
a
bar
or
restaurant
if
it
was
one
the
ipas
on
draft
but
probably
wont
be
purchasing
a
sixer
again
theres
just
so
many
other
better
options
out
there
although
the
price
point
is
great
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
i
think
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
hop
flavor
and
aroma
overall
though
i
like
it
overall
this
is
on
the
upper
level
of
ipas
the
flavor
is
impressive
for
the
abv
this
makes
good
for
any
situation
for
winter
enjoyment
its
a
nice
starter
beer
then
you
can
lean
on
the
heavier
ales
i
have
no
problem
killing
the
sixer
i
just
received
this
brew
is
recommended
poured
into

have
finally
drank
enough
to
know
the
smell
a

the
taste
starts
very
tropical
a
little
breadynesstoffee
and
papaya
and
grapefruit
finish
body
is
medium
large
nice
carbonation
not
really
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
is
really
well
done
i
feel
they
learned
a
lot
from
brewing
with
lawsons
and
am
excited
about
otter
creek
again
oa
great
smelling
and
tasting
rye
ipa
very
good
beer
from
otter
creek
wolavers
if
youre
a
hop
head
this
is
definitely
one
you
need
to
try
o
im
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
beer
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
rye
ipas
ever
its
really
impressive
how
drinkable
this
is
too
o
well
balanced
ryehop
mix
the
hop
slightly
over
powers
and
that
is
aok
with
me
a
really
good
drink
and
a
solid
offering
from
otter
creek
this
isnt
very
good
double
dose
is
outstanding
and
the
new
pale
is
also
pretty
good
this
just
isnt
for
me
malty
and
sweet
very
not
good
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
about
a
finger
upon
pouring
into
the
glass
the
head
lingered
as
a
small
white
ring
on
the
top
of
the
beer
in
the
glass
it
has
a
light
citrus
almost
orange
scent
to
it
as
the
amount
of
beer
in
the
glass
lessened
the
scent
turned
to
more
of
an
orange
than
at
the
beginning
started
out
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
quickly
faded
very
light
feeling
beer
almost
as
light
as
a
session
ipa
this
is
a
light
ipa
that
would
be
decent
for
a
nice
summer
day
and
at
only
6
would
be
fine
its
a
little
too
light
for
me
and
the
hoppy
kick
that
is
common
in
most
american
ipas
is
not
very
pronounced
in
this
decent
beer
to
try
but
i
will
not
be
buying
another
six
pack
of
it
for
a
little
while
a
good
rye
beer
overall
im
really
impressed
and
will
be
headed
back
for
more
than
a
single
bottle
definitely
worth
a
try
by
any
rye
fan
or
hophead
overall
a
rather
tasty
rye
with
a
rather
nice
blend
between
citrus
rye
grass
bread
and
sweet
while
not
quite
all
it
is
chalked
up
to
be
it
is
very
tasty
and
quite
balanced
as
i
drink
on
the
grainy
note
fades
away
and
no
longer
becomes
offensive
tons
of
green
leafiness
and
pine
in
this
ipa
with
an
almost
watery
body
and
a
strong
bitterness
a
very
well
made
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
for
sure
im
a
sucker
for
rye
liking
rye
in
beer
is
a
definite
prerequisite
for
trying
this
brew
or
you
arent
going
to
like
it
poured
a
golden
body
with
good
head
that
left
a
little
lace
strong
floral
hop
aroma
and
you
can
pick
up
touches
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
rye
the
hops
and
carbonation
give
the
beer
an
overall
dryer
sharper
feel
but
the
sweetness
and
the
rye
offer
great
balance
so
the
beer
is
never
cutting
and
easily
passes
over
the
tongue
straddles
the
line
between
hoppy
ale
for
the
hop
heads
and
milder
ale
for
those
who
arent
ipa
fans
overall
a
really
good
beer
nuff
said
thanks
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
signature
lemon
hoppiness
probably
limits
this
to
a
1
pint
beer
the
heavy
dose
of
caramel
malts
also
drags
down
drinkability
somewhat
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
is
a
solid
rye
ipa
its
not
flashy
and
theres
no
gimmicks
its
just
straight
foraward
and
well
crafted
well
this
the
second
brew
from
ocb
that
i
have
been
impressed
within
the
past
few
weeks
double
dose
being
the
other
in
general
i
am
not
much
of
a
fan
of
rye
ipas
but
this
is
certainly
an
exception
citrusy
fruity
spicy
rye
malt
and
bitters
come
together
in
a
way
that
i
have
never
experienced
in
a
rye
ipa
before
for
one
who
had
little
faith
in
ocb
i
am
now
willing
to
try
out
some
of
mikes
new
brews
i
honestly
wonder
if
sean
lawson
didnt
rub
off
on
him
in
the
best
way
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
like
rye
ipas
and
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
ripas
as
i
generally
am
then
i
strongly
suggest
you
rethink
whats
possible
in
the
style
hazy
copper
and
a
creamy
chunky
head
seriously
smells
of
citrus
grass
and
pine
along
with
the
spicy
tang
of
rye
and
a
touch
of
fruit
the
rye
steps
it
up
in
the
flavor
with
the
hops
keeping
things
piney
bitter
throughout
and
beyond
nice
medium
body
and
fine
carbonation
in
this
nicely
priced
beer
recommended
a
well
done
rye
ipa
that
is
well
worth
picking
up
mike
gerhart
makes
his
mark
once
again
pours
with
an
insane
white
head
orange
hazy
look
the
bottom
of
that
large
white
head
very
nice
hoppy
citrus
smell
that
is
very
impressive
for
an
ipa
the
taste
is
very
nice
the
rye
is
very
present
and
impressively
is
fairly
smooth
as
it
warms
it
actually
seems
to
have
a
bit
less
taste
but
its
still
enough
there
to
make
this
very
enjoyable
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
tasty
rye
ipa
q
overall
this
is
a
sessionable
and
enjoyable
beer
thats
perfectly
balanced
i
employed
an
aggro
pour
to
get
things
rolling
and
was
met
with
two
fluffy
fingers
of
tawny
head
that
soon
fell
away
to
nothingness
leaving
some
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
i
leaned
in
for
a
whiff
and
it
smelled
like
wake
n
bake
time
man
total
dank
phew
color
was
a
hazy
almost
cloudy
orangishamber
going
to
show
that
even
a
fairly
fresh
ipa
can
quickly
devolve
or
perhaps
it
was
unfiltered
but
either
way
i
was
ready
to
partake
jeez
louise
every
time
that
i
brought
it
near
my
nose
i
could
have
sworn
that
somebody
was
letting
me
sniff
a
baggie
of
their
freshlyharvested
basementgrown
stash
man
i
am
going
to
drink
half
of
this
and
then
put
the
other
half
in
a
water
pipe
please
note
that
i
am
very
careful
not
to
mention
any
terms
that
might
bring
homeland
security
or
other
unwanted
fuzztypes
to
my
pad
man
i
try
to
maintain
a
mellow
environment
here
at
chez
woody
dig
chill
is
the
watchword
man
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
big
like
a
dollop
of
that
special
caramel
the
old
lady
whipped
up
during
my
visit
to
canorado
man
it
was
also
kind
of
mellow
the
hops
not
choosing
to
be
confrontational
but
more
like
hey
man
how
are
you
let
us
do
you
a
solid
man
far
out
i
passed
it
to
chong
and
he
nodded
in
agreement
or
maybe
he
was
just
nodding
off
man
that
dude
really
knows
how
and
where
to
score
the
really
good
ahem
hops
the
wild
light
show
going
on
in
the
sky
through
the
windshield
was
mindblowing
and
as
kind
as
they
were
to
have
given
me
a
ride
i
had
them
drop
me
off
at
this
crazy
kittys
house
so
we
could
engage
in
some
extracurricular
activities
hey
man
the
woodman
does
not
live
by
or
with
the
old
lady
alone
and
she
does
her
own
thing
in
canorado
while
i
do
my
thing
here
in
pa
the
finish
was
cool
and
minty
dosed
with
rye
man
and
kitty
cat
thought
that
i
had
used
mouthwash
when
i
punched
her
in
the
mouth
with
my
lips
may
i
have
another
hit
of
this
one
please
overall
im
going
to
head
back
to
the
store
and
buy
more
this
is
everything
one
would
expect
out
of
a
rye
beer
12oz
with
093013
on
the
neck
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
spicy
hops
and
tropical
fruits
slightly
bready
the
taste
is
bitter
orange
peel
and
tangerine
spicy
hop
notes
as
well
some
bread
and
sweet
malts
floral
hop
notes
bitter
orange
peel
at
the
end
very
dry
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
quite
drinkable
overall
very
good
rye
thats
worth
seeking
out
im
hoping
this
isnt
just
a
one
time
brew
m
medium
bodied
odkind
ryed
is
a
tasty
treat
otter
creek
crafted
this
brew
very
well
this
and
double
dose
have
really
opened
my
eyes
to
otter
creeks
potential
the
taste
is
on
the
dank
herbal
side
with
some
leafy
grassy
hop
flavors
with
almost
piney
sharp
aspect
but
nice
mild
caramel
undertone
gives
a
nice
cushion
for
the
hop
forward
flavor
which
is
not
astringent
or
off
putting
but
definitely
aggressively
bitter
this
ipa
is
a
good
rye
ipa
to
me
because
it
seems
to
keep
both
the
hops
and
malt
flavor
in
mind
even
though
it
is
not
what
i
would
call
malty
just
not
out
of
balance
or
harsh
i
consider
this
to
be
tasty
and
drinkable
o
a
really
nice
rye
ipa
not
quite
as
good
as
the
big
3
of
vt
brewers
but
im
nitpicking
definitely
pick
this
up
if
you
can
i
think
itll
be
distributed
farther
than
double
dose
was
and
at
9
bucks
a
six
pack
you
cant
go
wrong
this
beer
is
appallingly
under
rated
i
mean
yeah
it
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
and
sure
it
might
not
be
the
most
delicious
beer
in
the
whole
world
but
to
score
this
so
low
is
offensive
the
beer
is
aweomse
its
a
clear
golden
color
dim
in
the
radiance
but
bright
in
aroma
and
taste
honey
is
raw
and
not
all
that
sweet
but
real
authentic
and
something
pretty
unique
in
a
beer
as
its
flavorful
and
not
fermented
out
but
yet
pretty
dry
the
rye
is
what
makes
it
though
for
me
honey
and
rye
together
they
almost
act
to
offset
one
another
but
instead
join
forces
and
make
it
distinct
mellow
but
bold
real
hard
to
do
but
really
well
done
there
again
a
little
flat
and
thats
my
main
knock
against
it
but
this
is
a
great
sixer
of
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
montana
and
a
cool
fusion
of
ingredients
that
dont
always
get
paired
together
excellent
beer
drinkable
for
miles
and
im
craving
another
as
i
type
this
way
better
than
the
others
i
have
had
from
madison
river
light
goldenamber
color
with
slight
foamy
head
faint
nose
not
picking
up
much
rye
like
i
expected
picking
up
mostly
the
honey
light
rye
taste
and
other
grains
honey
more
prominent
on
tongue
than
nose
acidity
and
carbonation
lingers
smooth
lighter
feel
blends
well
somewhat
foamy
texture
overall
not
bad
not
as
tasty
as
id
like
it
to
be
would
recommend
for
a
session
style
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
overall
a
decent
brew
overall
that
is
fairly
easy
drinking
good
but
nothing
super
outrageous
a
decent
thirst
quencher
but
wont
knock
your
socks
off
theres
a
definite
lack
of
rye
flavor
it
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
having
a
rye
and
honey
centric
ale
is
good
for
a
change
considering
all
of
the
ipas
and
hoppy
pales
on
the
shelves
i
like
how
the
rye
and
honey
are
prominent
but
some
yeast
flavors
creep
up
and
take
away
from
that
later
on
in
the
experience
this
seemed
like
rather
a
dull
beer
to
begin
with
but
as
it
warmed
its
character
shone
through
the
rye
is
not
highly
noticeable
but
neither
is
the
honey
overdone
i
give
it
better
than
average
scores
all
around
flavor
combination
of
tangy
peppery
rye
some
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavor
sweet
toasted
malts
the
honey
is
detectable
but
not
overwhelming
sampled
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
relatively
pale
goldjust
shy
of
amber
rye
beer
with
minimal
white
froth
on
top
i
was
immediately
struck
by
the
fruity
nose
which
features
assertive
but
nondescript
orchard
fruit
notes
citrus
and
floral
vanilla
overlaid
on
a
sweet
white
bread
and
cereal
malt
base
not
much
in
the
way
of
rye
character
on
the
nose
as
is
so
often
the
case
the
taste
follows
the
nose
indubitably
the
fruitiest
rye
beer
ive
yet
to
encounter
the
orchard
fruit
carries
over
onto
the
taste
buds
pear
theres
some
vanilla
and
sweet
honey
violets
graham
cracker
and
some
characteristic
rye
spice
thankfully
although
this
latter
element
is
still
downplayed
compared
to
most
examples
of
the
style
theres
some
rye
enhancement
but
not
much
someone
apparently
did
not
wish
to
alienate
too
many
palates
and
the
result
is
a
rye
beer
that
comes
off
like
a
highend
cream
ale
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
thinnish
body
and
some
pleasant
lemonlime
citrus
in
the
finish
which
lacks
in
the
bitterness
and
spice
departments
rather
difficult
to
rate
this
one
as
while
i
enjoyed
it
on
the
basis
of
its
own
merits
it
is
missing
much
in
the
way
of
rye
character
pours
light
gold
minuscule
foam
hazy
honey
nose
with
hints
of
rye
but
more
of
the
sweetness
smooth
taste
opens
sweet
with
honey
and
closes
that
way
too
barely
get
a
touch
of
bitter
in
the
middle
low
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
an
ok
brew
certainly
too
light
on
the
signature
rye
flavor
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
may
disappoint
some
who
try
it
and
expect
something
differentbetter
i
find
it
okay
but
other
than
drinking
it
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
i
am
not
so
sure
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
this
is
not
that
great
of
a
beer
overall
but
is
decent
enough
for
a
session
ale
on
hot
summer
months
ill
save
the
other
2
bottles
for
then
overall
salmon
fly
honey
rye
was
heavily
over
carbonated
and
had
a
flavor
profile
that
barely
beats
out
higherend
macros
part
of
this
may
be
my
fault
as
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
august
of
2011
on
a
research
trip
to
yellowstone
however
i
think
a
majority
of
the
faults
are
inherent
to
the
beer
itself
and
i
dont
foresee
myself
ever
purchasing
this
again
not
going
to
be
revisiting
this
one
not
enough
flavor
to
make
it
worth
my
while
overall
a
sessionable
rye
beer
by
madison
the
fruity
notes
were
pleasant
but
i
was
wanting
the
traditional
biscuity
flavours
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
rye
beer
other
than
that
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
nice
brew
you
should
save
this
for
a
warm
day
it
goes
down
easy
and
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
buy
it
again
o
a
lightly
flavored
and
fairly
uninteresting
beer
but
not
an
offensive
beer
not
something
im
likely
to
drink
again
super
smooth
beer
that
really
just
drank
well
nothing
too
complex
but
i
would
totally
buy
again
if
i
was
a
local
i
would
most
likely
make
this
a
regular
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
track
one
down
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
hazy
yellow
pour
medium
white
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
not
much
going
on
the
flavor
is
light
sweet
dont
really
detect
the
rye
the
finish
is
sweet
the
body
is
light
easy
drinking
drinks
like
a
wheat
beer
good
summertime
brew
would
have
liked
to
see
more
rye
in
the
taste
overall
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
but
is
nicely
refreshing
and
has
a
good
flavor
even
though
it
is
on
the
light
side
easy
quaffing
not
going
over
the
top
with
honey
is
a
plus
i
dont
think
id
go
looking
for
a
second
but
im
not
upset
there
was
a
first
overall
drinkability
mild
though
flavorful
and
very
refreshing
great
at
what
it
sets
out
to
do
overall
if
it
was
the
only
thing
around
sure
i
bet
this
is
way
better
on
tap
though
overall
a
pretty
eh
beer
like
an
adjunct
lager
but
slightly
more
interesting
pretty
sweet
grainy
for
sure
goes
down
easy
an
id
have
a
couple
on
a
hot
day
but
id
rather
have
something
else
o
pretty
bland
beer
nothing
fatally
wrong
with
it
just
no
pop
here
i
mean
lets
be
honest
this
isnt
breaking
molds
with
innovation
and
creativity
but
its
not
a
bad
effort
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
really
wish
there
was
a
lot
more
rye
showcased
in
this
beer
especially
considering
its
plastered
in
the
name
of
the
beer
lawnmower
football
etc
type
of
beer
okay
but
nothing
special
here
o
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
summer
time
mowing
the
lawn
or
just
sitting
at
the
beach
it
is
better
than
many
macros
and
is
not
too
complicated
overall
a
pretty
plain
brew
without
too
much
rye
things
going
on
to
really
push
the
flavor
buttons
but
its
well
made
and
decent
enough
for
perhaps
some
warm
weather
drinking
o
pretty
lackluster
not
really
much
going
on
here
that
i
enjoyed
light
bodied
lightish
carbonation
this
has
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
frankly
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
back
to
back
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
drink
the
other
5
bottles
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
would
happily
partake
of
again
it
had
some
draw
backs
with
the
lack
of
body
and
neutral
aroma
but
it
was
more
than
made
up
for
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
d
not
the
best
flavor
but
still
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
do
very
crisp
very
refreshing
at
5
5abv
would
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
in
the
summer
first
montana
beer
reviewed
thanks
fdkayti
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
several
of
in
a
sitting
the
refreshing
nature
keeps
me
coming
back
for
another
drink
and
it
has
a
unique
flavor
that
clings
to
the
palate
for
quite
awhile
after
the
swallow
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
and
i
recommend
giving
this
a
try
gotta
knock
it
down
a
few
pegs
an
enjoyable
enough
um
pale
ale
as
both
the
honey
and
the
rye
do
their
utmost
to
stay
pretty
much
under
the
radar
the
expected
malt
spiciness
going
duly
unrewarded
and
nothing
overtly
beehiveworthy
manifesting
at
any
particular
point
easy
enough
to
drink
however
despite
these
minor
disappointments
just
pay
little
heed
to
the
name
of
this
offering
there
is
no
salmon
very
little
honey
or
rye
and
well
as
for
the
fly
there
really
is
no
hook
here
to
make
me
want
to
seek
out
more
its
a
lightlycloudy
copper
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
and
taste
were
a
small
amount
of
rye
nothing
much
there
but
a
small
amount
of
sourness
the
honey
seemed
absent
it
didnt
make
me
wretch
but
im
not
going
to
go
looking
for
another
one
d
nothing
too
exciting
here
at
all
not
much
smell
or
taste
with
this
one
body
is
on
the
light
side
with
a
fairly
abundant
carbonation
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
but
i
would
get
bored
fairly
quickly
a
good
summer
drink
think
this
coulda
been
a
good
one
but
it
seems
to
be
turning
the
sour
dominates
all
else
but
hidden
in
there
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
do
pick
up
some
good
grainyness
a
little
honey
a
bit
chewy
some
head
and
lace
decent
body
honey
finish
be
interesting
to
try
another
maybe
someday
ugh
i
hate
slamming
craft
brews
but
this
is
awful
listless
sticky
on
the
finish
and
a
stale
taste
that
lingers
it
could
be
a
bad
bottle
but
theres
nothing
to
indicate
anything
but
poor
brewing
mild
rye
presence
with
subtle
sweet
spiciness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
sort
of
wimpy
it
could
use
a
touch
more
body
needs
more
hops
and
spicy
rye
flavor
as
it
stands
its
very
light
and
sessionable
it
showcases
balance
without
flying
the
extreme
flag
at
barcade
founders
tap
takeover
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
the
original
red
rye
much
sweeter
with
hints
of
vanilla
still
a
good
beer
i
was
just
surprised
in
the
difference
o
this
is
fantastic
and
the
benchmark
for
me
as
far
as
bourbon
barrel
aged
hoppy
beers
are
concerned
the
smoother
hop
profile
and
spice
notes
really
complement
the
barrel
and
really
give
this
beer
a
sort
of
pina
colada
flavor
this
is
much
better
that
ba
double
trouble
doom
which
was
too
dank
and
piney
for
the
barrel
aging
imo
overall
totally
different
from
reds
rye
the
barrel
character
is
nice
though
drinks
like
a
small
hoppy
barleywine
ooverall
i
say
if
love
reds
rye
youll
really
love
this
one
i
really
enjoy
the
complexities
that
the
barrel
brings
however
the
bright
hop
character
of
the
pale
ale
has
been
slightly
compromised
but
the
balance
remains
in
tact
just
rearranged
slightly
with
all
the
pluses
and
minuses
i
call
this
one
a
wash
reds
rye
has
a
very
deep
amber
color
that
appears
red
hence
the
term
reds
rye
end
with
a
bitter
taste
looks
like
a
welcoming
beer
but
doesnt
taste
that
way
if
i
had
to
say
something
pleasant
i
would
say
it
has
vanilla
notes
overall
i
would
not
recommend
not
my
favorite
combination
i
like
reds
rye
and
i
like
bourbon
barreled
beers
but
the
aging
should
probably
be
limited
to
allow
the
base
beer
to
shine
through
more
wish
the
citrus
presence
were
more
pronounced
and
alcohol
were
more
subtle
just
not
a
fan
of
that
founders
tastr
big
hops
toasty
and
a
touch
malty
nice
flavor
but
not
an
easy
drinker
invested
in
a
full
12
barrel
for
my
home
tap
love
this
stuff
great
balance
of
bitter
body
and
unique
flavor
of
rye
nice
maroon
color
and
head
that
creates
a
nice
lacing
avoid
if
you
dont
like
rye
but
if
that
is
good
for
you
it
is
a
great
alternative
to
super
hoppy
west

ipas
pours
a
transluscent
pale

zest
and

like
a

with
a
malty
rye
backbone
well
balanced
clean
bitterness
at
the
end
very
drinkable
not

sweet
something
that
could

with

giving
it
that
zing
of

an

on

it
nicely

with

many
love
this
brew
i
personally
love
rye
brews
yet
the
hops
are
a
bit
strong
to
my
liking
hop
heads
dream
this
is
an
amazingly
heady
malt
bomb
packed
with
rye
spiciness
superb
malt
sweetness
and
welltempered
hop
bitterness
and
bite
from
the
incredible
sticky
brittle
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
to
the
evil
malt
sweetness
and
sugary
feel
spiked
with
a
delicious
rye
pep
in
the
flavor
and
the
nearly
decadent
pleasure
of
the
heavy
rich
mouthfeel
this
is
one
winner
of
a

an
exceptional
find
and
even
better

experience

aroma
of
straight

taste
started
incredibly
strong
with
the
caramel
marshmallow
overpowering
everything
as
i
went
along
some
hopmalt
presence
became
more
apparent
but
the
caramel
remained
throughout
this
beer
has
an
incredible
rich
feel
that
is
only
enhanced
by
the
caramel
taste
very
interesting
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
decent
head
despite
its
light
color
this
thing
pours
nice
and
thick
very
surprised
with
the
hefty
body
smells
clean
and
piney
typical
of
an
ipa
taste
is
wonderful
nice
clean
and
refreshing
but
not
thin
has
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
nice
and
creamy
with
no
bitterness
a
great
fantastic
beer
raw
and
somewhat
rustic
in
taste
it
nearly
earthen
taste
from
rye
and
barley
offers
a
moderate
semblance
of
balance
even
though
the
ales
finish
is
maltydry
and
deeply
resinous
with
torn
pine
needles
evergreen
and
citrus
both
its
medium
body
and
its
long
bittersweet
finish
is
the
perfect
companion
for
american
cheeseburgers
the
verdict
this
is
really
well
crafted
i
love
it
and
highly
recommend
you
go
find
it
asap
its
clear
this
was
made
with
thoughtfulness
care
and
love
just
as
i
expect
from

beerandwhiskeyhq
com
pours
a
deep
slightly
cloudy
red
drifting
towards
brown
a
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
lasts
throughout
the
beer
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
soft
but
not
lacking
in
character
with
distinct
hops
notes
of
floral
and
citrus
the
taste
is
excellent
with
strong
malt
flavors
balanced
superbly
by
the
hops
and
with
a
nice
peppery
notes
on
the
finish
provided
by
the
rye
the
body
is
just
the
right
weight
and
there
is
a
wonderful
silky
feeling
and
crisp
finish
this
is
a
great
rye
ipa
very
nice
beer
refreshing
with
different
characteristics
rye
ipas
dont
always
work
but
this
one
shines
among
its
competitors
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
excellent
on
occasion
this
is
certainly
not
a
heavy
beer
but
for
me
it
is
difficult
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
is
a
very
nice
change
in
pace
having
a
rye
beer
every
once
in
while
because
of
the
flavor
that
it
brings
the
table
great
color
dark
redish
amber
color
white
head
thats
moderately
thin
scents
of
hops
came
through
right
away
it
definitely
has
some
fruit
notes
as
well
it
has
a
light
earthy
taste
as
well
almost
more
like
grass
as
opposed
to
those
heavy
earth
tones
the
hops
taste
lingers
yet
it
finishes
off
nicely
very
flavorful
and
a
great
overall
ipa
overall
enjoyable
with
a
lot
of
great
qualities
well
balanced
sweet
but
still
has
some
bitter
elements
this
brew
offers
lots
of
malt
hops
rye
and
some
grapefruit
but
just
a
little
too
much
bitterness
especially
on
the
after
taste
the
bitterness
almost
leaves
a
flavor
that
makes
the
beer
unenjoyble
and
i
am
a
big
ipa
drinker
so
i
am
usually
used
to
this
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
like
the
other
founders
ipas
do
deep
red
in
colour
thin
white
head
this
beer
was
once
called
a
rye
pale
ale
as
much
as
i
like
ipas
i
wish
it
had
remained
as
such
i
feel
its
a
bit
too
bitter
to
be
able
to
appreciate
the
rye
in
the
recipe
ive
had
others
that
are
more
subtle
maybe
our
friends
south
of
the
border
are
in
fact
too
into
their
bitter
beers
still
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
good
mouthfeel
just
overpowered
by
the
70
ibus
in
terms
of
india
pale
ales
this
beer
is
not
overly
bitter
a
very
nice
red
color
lives
up
to
the
name
and
its
welcoming
aroma
of
peaches
leads
to
an
easy
drink
especially
for
fans
of
bitter
beers
for
those
trying
to
delve
into
the
ipa
world
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
medium
mouth
feel
with
malty
hints
very
strong
bitter
notes
that
leave
a
not
so
enjoyable
after
taste
has
a
very
welcoming
appearance
and
smell
but
was
very
thrown
off
by
the
flavor
not
my
favorite
beer
to
taste
but
a
decent
ipa
for
what
its
worth
doesnt
leave
an
enjoyable
mouth
feel
and
the
bitter
taste
lacks
enthusiasm
this
is
a
beer
caramel
in
color
once
you
bring
it
up
to
your
nose
you
can
smell
hints
of
citrus
once
you
taste
this
beer
you
can
taste
the
hops
as
well
as
some
slight
citrus
flavors
this
also
has
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
does
have
a
very
strong
aftertaste
this
beer
was
poured
from
my
growler
into
a
regular
pint
glass
pour
was
amber
color
with
a
little
lightness
to
it
very
nice
my
pour
had
a
fairly
small
white
head
smell
as
happy
with
some
grapefruit
and
a
little
lemony
taste
was
similar
to
that
as
it
was
flavorful
and
happy
with
a
citrus
kick
but
decently
balanced
this
was
my
first
time
having
this
beer
and
i
was
very
happy
with
it
when
available
on
tap
i
will
definitely
get
again
solid
brew
from
founders
overall
wonderful
get
some
of
this
one
fresh
and
it
wont
disappoint
if
you
like
grapefruit
it
is
seriously
a
gulpable
brew
evan
though
this
is
8
months
old
it
is
still
flavorable
with
the
rye
predominating
the
reduced
presence
of
hops
could
be
because
of
the
age
of
the
beer
m
great
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
soothing
overall
nice
beer
i
like
it
o
a
ripa
fully
realized
however
theyve
honed
this
recipe
is
very
impressive
since
a
lot
of
rye
beers
miss
the
mark
for
whatever
reason
this
one
has
a
good
balance
and
the
flavors
arent
overly
accentuated
o
founders
makes
some
of
my
favorite
brews
and
and
this
one
is
no
slouch
well
balanced
including
an
interesting
hop
transformation
from
nose
to
mouth
i
typically
enjoy
rye
ipas
and
this
one
rates
up
there
with
the
best
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
rye
beer
it
is
not
as
heavy
on
the
rye
and
peppery
spices
as
other
ryes
i
have
had
but
the
strong
sweet
malt
backbone
makes
up
for
that
it
could
be
said
that
this
is
a
rye
ipa
for
those
who
dont
like
to
be
overwhelmed
by
rye
o
once
labeled
reds
rye
pa
the
addition
of
one
single
letter
suits
the
beer
a
little
more
reds
rye
ipa
is
a
hopandrye
forward
beer
that
doesnt
focus
directly
on
one
ingredient
or
the
other
but
melds
the
two
in
harmony
as
grapefruit
earthy
and
floral
attributes
blend
with
the
spicy
rye
over
biscuity
bready
malt
for
a
superb
balance
considering
its
listed
ibus
at
a
fair
6
6
this
fullflavored
beer
packs
a
wallop
without
walloping
the
imbiber
one
hell
of
a
combination
very
lively
top
of
class
must
try
original
yet
not
fussy
o
i
want
more
so
smooth
velvety
spicy
dry
all
the
notes
i
like
in
rye
whisky
but
toned
down
a
bit
this
ale
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
lasts
just
a
minute
or
so
the
aroma
is
all
rye
malt
and
spice
there
is
little
to
no
hint
of
hops
or
of
the
ipa
qualities
of
this
beer
its
sips
dry
and
a
little
rough
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
on
the
tail
end
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
this
type
of
ale
the
flavor
is
definitely
rye
and
a
lot
of
malt
almost
more
like
a
porter
than
an
ipa
there
is
virtually
no
hoppiness
at
all
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
still
rarely
disappointed
by
founders
its
just
not
what
i
expect
from
a
rye
ipa
hits
on
the
rye
notes
but
not
on
the
ipa
ones
this
is
a
great
beer
deep
amber
color
grainy
sweet
carmelized
malty
smell
and
tastes
of
earthy
grains
slightly
citrus
with
a
hint
of
dry
hops
very
enjoyable
improves
dramatically
as
it
warms
continues
to
reveal
new
subtle
flavors
with
each
drink
o
excellent
drinkability
absolutely
delicious
pa
my
7th
founders
which
gets
an
above
4
evaluation
what
else
can
i
say
about
this
brewery
the
mouthfeel
was
nothing
spectacular
but
by
no
means
bad
i
actually
wanted
another
as
soon
as
i
was
done
my
only
complaint
was
the
bitter
dry
finish
damn
tasty
though
o
this
thing
is
a
treat
exceeded
all
expectations
amber
colored
with
a
bit
of
a
red
tint
a
thin
off
white
wisp
of
a
head
covers
most
of
the
top
of
this
beer
good
clarity
i
get
a
nice
combo
of
rye
and
pine
like
hops
in
the
nose
the
front
of
the
palate
i
get
more
of
the
rye
and
then
a
nice
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
kick
in
and
remain
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
has
some
moderate
carbonation
o
overall
i
find
this
the
perfect
beer
o
enjoyable
and
will
definitely
be
one
or
two
four
packs
a
year
little
pricey
at
the
4
pack
format
but
unique
and
very
little
out
there
is
like
it
best
right
after
release
as
many
contend
overall
a
solid
beer
nice
balance
between
sweetness
and
bitterness
the
rye
and
hops
complement
each
other
well
definitely
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
red
ale
even
though
its
only
6
o
this
bottle
is
about
3
months
old
but
this
beer
is
holding
up
quite
nicely
im
sure
some
of
the
hop
flavors
have
dissipated
but
its
still
an
amazing
brew
i
got
a
4
pack
for
8
so
i
cant
complain
ill
keep
buying
these
at
that
price
overall
great
rye
character
but
its
body
made
me
struggle
through
the
whole
pint
owell
balanced
beer
like
an
ipa
dry
hopped
o
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
founders
disappointed
in
myself
for
waiting
this
long
to
try
this
one
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
flavors
blended
beautifully
and
each
category
was
well
above
average
i
looked
for
rye
in
the
taste
but
couldnt
really
find
it
but
who
cares
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
o
excellent
rye
infused
beer
another
winner

the
taste
is

mingle
nicely

are

low

suits
the
taste
well
overall
a
very
good
offering
from

o
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
sure
i
dig
the
style
cheers
overall
good
beer
interesting
i
like
how
the
beer
changes
from
first
sip
to
middle
to
aftertaste
and
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
and
strong
flavors
that
work
well
together
other
than
harvest
ale
this
is
founders
best
hoppy
brew
love
it
o
i
dont
know
what
to
say
here
it
is
good
almost
great
but
i
feel
that
it
isnt
missing
something
pours
amber
with
a
dark
ruby
red
tint
fair
head
that
laces
well
but
fades
fairly
quickly
light
medium
body
with
a
hoppy
nose
the
rye
flavor
tends
to
be
overpowered
by
the
hops
assuming
a
more
background
presence
in
the
flavor
profile
a
bit
less
hops
would
improve
the
balance
and
bring
the
rye
more
forward
slight
but
pleasant
hop
bitterness
as
an
aftertaste
while
the
rye
becomes
more
pronounced
another
excellent
founders
product
overall
wonderful
beer
great
substitute
for
your
snpa
or
the
like
reds
rye
is
a
step
up
for
sure
in
complexity
but
a
logical
next
step
for
those
seeking
to
branch
out
and
try
some
more
unique
pale
ales
cheers
really
outstanding
take
on
an
ipa
keep
in
mind
i
just
drank
a
sculpin
before
this
which
i
consider
one
of
the
best
ipas
there
is
the
rye
just
adds
a
little
something
a
little
breadyness
a
little
something
different
but
still
really
good
it
has
all
the
aromas
you
expect
from
a
great
ipa
grapefruit
mango
pine
the
malt
bill
seems
much
higher
than
a
typical
ipa
so
you
get
a
really
good
malt
sweetness
to
counter
the
bitter
hops
dry
finish
only
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
if
you
havent
had
it
try

great
american
red
ale
i
love
founders
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
have
found
i
really
enjoy
rye
infused
brews
definitely
try
it
if
you
have
the
chance

for
a
6pk
o
complex
hop
and
malt
flavors
in
great
synergy
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
just
wish
the
hop
aroma
would
stick
around
longer
maybe
its
fighting
with
the
rye
great
beer
either
way

had
a
bottle
i
bought
on
the
cheap
at
spirit
haus
in
amherst
about
ten
days
ago
it
was
dated

too
weak
to
see
with
the
naked
eye
in
normal
light
in
the
store
its
smooth
but
not
all
that
hoppy
very
good
but
not
great
worth
what
i
paid
2
overall
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
rye
beers
available
it
might
be
my
favorite
beer
from
founders
as
well
complex
and
balanced
as
well
as
highly
drinkable
enough
body
to
stand
up
to
colder
weather
and
heartier
foods
but
refreshing
enough
to
fit
in
with
hot
weather
and
light
foods
as
well
o
a
beer
to
drink
slow
and
savor
another
great
founders
product
wish
it
was
still
year
round
get
it
while
you
can
o
overall
reds
rye
pa
from
founders
is
an
excellent
rye
beer
that
is
highly
recommened
overall
a
real
easy
drinking
rye
pale
recommended
overall
back
in
my
craft
beer
infancy
this
was
the
first
rye
beer
i
ever
had
and
i
have
to
say
it
still
exemplifies
everything
a
good
rye
pa
should
be
this
is
the
the
measuring
stick
that
i
use
to
judge
all
other
rye
beers
despite
being
bitter
and
hoppy
the
beer
is
really
well
balanced
just
another
phenomenal
beer
from
founders
o
founders
did
it
again
with
releasing
this
take
on
a
rye
pa
by
far
the
most
refreshing
and
crisp
rye
pa
i
have
had
the
only
thing
i
wish
is
a
little
more
predominant
rye
flavor
but
that
discrepancy
ends
up
being
a
strength
in
this
offering
mouthfeel
is
great
crisp
and
refreshing
not
too
think
and
very
slight
resins
oils
from
the
hops
yeah
buddy
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
bronze
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
rye
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
spicy
hops
rye
a
bit
of
citrus
very
dry
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
o
a
refreshing
break
from
extreme
hop
flavors
meld
to
a
nice
balance
o
if
you
get
a
chance
please
do
try
this
one
i
am
unfortunately
going
from
memory
i
would
be
all
in
favor
of
this
beauty
achieving
year
round
status
the
heartless
bastards
at
founders
have
made
it
a
seasonal
brew
for
some
unknown
an
obviously
insufficient
reason
had
it
on
tap
at
founders
brew
pub
which
was
a
slice
of
heaven
but
by
the
bottle
it
is
extremely
close
to
fresh
tap
taste
founders
is
awesome
and
i
highly
recommend
this
heavenly
brew
to
just
about
anyone
as
the
maltiness
and
hop
finish
are
sublimely
and
superbly
blended
to
achieve
party
in
your
mouth
status
it
is
just
about
perfect
for
beer
lovers
of
most
types
cheers

o
love
this
beer
big
fan
of
the
delicious
rye
taste
and
the
delicious
smoothness
one
of
my
new
favorites
o
this
beer
it
utterly
awesome
the
rye
and
hops
blend
amazingly
well
together
to
give
a
unique
treat
so
smooth
and
sweet
i
am
super
impressed
overall
a
brawny
full
bodied
hop
bomb
very
nicely
made
this
is
a
real
treat
to
drink
and
actually
goes
down
quite
easily
in
spite
of
any
thickness
at
this
point
im
not
so
set
on
founders
hopfocused
beers
but
their
maltier
offerings
are
fantastic
this
may
be
old
at
this
point
but
its
still
drinking
amazingly
well
i
love
the
spiciness
imparted
by
the
rye
as
well
as
the
earthiness
rather
than
excessive
sweetness
on
part
of
the
predominant
malts
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
but
it
seems
to
be
good
any
time
truly
ahead
in
the
style
o
i
could
probably
be
a
little
more
generous
here
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
founders
all
of
the
features
complement
each
other
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
perfect
for
this
cold
rainy
afternoon

stubby

wow
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
offering
really
great

the

not

a

overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
reds
rye
pa
and
i
certainly
found
enjoyment
in
the
rye
ipa
however
i
feel
that
rrpa
could
be
so
much
more
in
terms
of
flavor
it
looks
nice
it
smells
great
but
the
taste
leaves
me
expecting
more
i
would
toss
a
few
more
tropical
fruits
into
the
mix
since
im
only
an
hour
or
so
away
from

not

a

smells
of

tropical
fruit
with
some
rye
taste
follows
the
nose
but
with
a
more
pronounced
rye
taste
also
has
a
bit
of
a
sting
from
the
hops
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
crisp
about
average
or
just
below
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
pretty
good

wouldnt

in
the
blend
well
carbonated
too
as
with
all

offerings
quite
good
overall
this
is
certainly
a
good
beer
but
not
even
close
to
the
best
founders
has
to
offer
i
could
name
a
half
dozen
founders
beers
better
than
this
although
it
is
certainly
deserving
of
a
try
it
just
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
beer
of
fame
although
it
is
most
beers
of
fame
really
leave
an
impression
but
this
is
mildly
forgettable
give
it
a
shot
but
i
wasnt
too
wrapped
up
about
it
an
interesting
style
for
founders
despite
its
average
6
abv
it
comes
across
as
somewhat
heavy
than
the
style
would
have
you
believe
while
not
big
on
rye
i
could
still
recommend
this
for
a
single
quaff
that
is
that
for
this
amber
hazy
and
with
a
white
soapy
head
the
beer
has
a
clean
aroma
some
woody
earthy
scents
spicy
hops
some
malt
e
rye
does
not
come
out
in
the
smell
as
much
as
it
does
in
the
taste
sweet
up
front
with
lots
of
malt
some
softness
and
grain
character
wood
and
chaff
firm
body
solidly
good
this
is
one
hell
of
a
tasty
beer
definitely
worth
purchasing
again
solid
beer
with
a
decent
malt
support
to
counter
the
bitter
rye
character
and
enough
flavoring
hops
to
add
intrigue
would
prefer
more
complexity
in
hop
flavor
and
less
bitterness
but
thats
personal
preference
o
another
great
beer
by
founders
best
rye
ipa
i
have
had
yet
will
be
looking
for
this
one
again
no
doubt
o
again
a
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
yet
quite
flavorful
ipa
the
rye
grain
lends
a
spiciness
to
the
profile
that
is
really
works
well
with
the
citrusy
hops
not
the
best
rye
ipa
offering
out
there
but
i
still
like
it
alot
overall
recomeded
a
nice
rye
beer
highly
recommended
beer
dude
1
enjoyed
the
reddish
hue
described
by
beer
dude
2
it
was
a
very
smooth
yet
hoppy
flavor
that
was
pleasing
to
the
palate
dude
2
dropped
a
chip
in
his
beer
giving
it
a
rich
and
original
flavor
to
and
already
enjoyable
taste
test
dude
3
says
outstanding
flavor
great
dark
red
amber
that
pours
heavy
with
a
nice
head
the
taste
is
prevelant
immediately
and
is
a
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
cant
quite
compare
the
taste
to
anything
else
at
the
moment
but
i
found
it
excellent
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
full
taste
and
not
an
overpowering
after
taste
not
to
strong
abv
wise
nor
too
watered
down
just
a
phenomenal
beer
i
was
lucky
to
find
at
my
local
craft
store
two
draughts
and
an
immediate
purchase
of
a
four
packs
should
say
enough
excellent
o
great
beer
love
the
freshness
uniqueness
balance
herbal
healthy
quality
the
label
the
company
the
colour
etc
great
by
itself
it
would
go
well
with
scottish
oat
cakes
and
whipped
butter
o
this
is
a
great
beer
exactly
what
you
would
expect
with
founders
like
great
american
pale
ales
it
pleases
with
its
hops
however
the
addition
of
rye
creates
a
spicy
earthy
and
wonderfully
different
tone
for
this
brew
get
this
beer
whenever
and
however
you
can
it
is
excellent
taste
is
slightly
sweet
from
the
caramel
malt
but
more
than
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
nice
spicy
rye
character
quite
bready
body
has
good
depth
without
being
too
heavy
soft
but
ample
carbonation
lends
a
creaminess
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
after
pouring
from
bottle
to
glass
it
looked
beautiful
and
rich
and
smelled
powerfully
good
there
was
plenty
of
good
flavor
and
a
fantastic
after
taste
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
not
get
sick
of
it
or
have
any
desire
to
switch
it
up
this
beer
cannot
be
recommended
enough
a
nicely
balanced
beer
thats
not
over
powered
with
the
rye
easy
drinking
and
would
go
great
with
a
steak
i
again
bend
my
rebuilt
knees
to
the
gifted
beer
geniuses
at
founders
o
very
tasty
beer
and
very
similar
to
hop
rod
rye
which
i
just
had
the
other
day
the
rye
certainly
adds
a
different
component
to
the
brew
that
makes
for
a
highly
quaffable
hoppy
ale
not
sure
who
red
is
but
i
likes
his
beer
just
fine
o
a
tasty
treat
that
deserves
the
recognition
it
receives
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
and
thick
not
in
a
bad
way
though
carbonation
is
medium
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
harshness
of
the
rye
is
held
in
check
by
the
other
flavors
im
glad
i
got
it
and
will
probably
be
picking
up
a
sixer
of
it
in
the
near
future
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
sessionable
moderate
carbonation
no
astringency
except
for
some
bitterness
a
touch
of
rye
a
strong
hop
flavor
and
some
earthy
flavors
dominate
an
unbalanced
array
the
hops
are
a
touch
overpowering
but
then
again
thats
what
was
advertised
the
rye
is
left
begging
wanting
to
share
the
spotlight
but
getting
drowned
out
the
finish
is
a
touch
earthy
almost
oniony
overall
the
taste
is
of
a
good
quality
i
just
caught
myself
savoring
the
malty
grainy
rye
flavors
and
wishing
the
hops
didnt
overwhelm
o
solid
rye
beer
the
smell
stood
out
the
most
to
me
very
nice
well
done
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
amazing
its
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
too
recommendable
o
the
gold
standard
for
the
rye
beer
style
perfect
balance
of
flavors
plus
drinkablity
and
a
great
body
founders
hits
another
out
of
the
park
o
very
good
brew
not
one
that
grabs
you
up
front
with
a
bite
but
a
nice
relaxing
finish
will
buy
again
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
perfect
fusion
of
rye
and
hops
would
have
this
again
for
sure
pours
a
reddish
brown
almost
maroon
hue
with
short
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
spice
and
strong
hops
scents
of
wheat
and
grains
and
rye
tastes
of
bitter
citrus
hops
pine
and
grain
citrus
hops
are
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
malt
flavors
are
light
but
some
creaminess
comes
through
bitterness
subtle
notes
of
grass
ginger
cinnamon
apple
grains
are
earthy
but
with
some
nut
meat
overall
a
superbly
bitter
ipa
with
much
more
grain
and
earthy
tones
than
your
average
ipa
also
more
pine
notes
and
strength
in
the
hops
than
your
average
ipa
but
what
drastically
sets
this
ipa
apart
from
the
pack
is
the
grains
o
very
solid
spicy
pale
ale
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
o
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
the
rye
breadlike
features
of
this
beer
make
fora
nice
twist
on
a
solid
ipa
the
earthy
hops
are
noticed
up
front
in
the
taste
like
the
aroma
with
a
classic
balance
of
grains
moderating
the
overall
flavor
there
is
a
huge
bitterness
at
the
end
rye
pas
are
not
high
on
my
style
list
but
this
was
a
fine
example
of
it
overall
big
aroma
visually
great
taste
maybe
overly
busy
but
enjoyable
as
a
different
take
on
an
ipa
othis
is
an
amazing
brew
from
an
amazing
brewery
and
an
amazing
style
i
feel
this
beer
is
greatly
overlooked
and
underrated
had
this
one
at
the
brick
store
pub
in
downtown
decatur
the
hops
is
masked
a
bit
too
much
at
first
sip
however
i
did
pick
up
the
customary
ipa
bitterness
at
the
end
there
was
a
tad
too
much
rye
on
the
front
end
and
not
a
sufficient
amount
of
hop
bitterness
for
my
taste
i
enjoy
all
the
other
founders
brews
but
have
to
put
this
one
at
the
back
of
the
bus
having
said
that
while
i
would
never
go
out
of
the
way
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
or
growler
i
would
certainly
order
it
at
one
of
our
atlanta
area
beer
bars
if
the
other
draught
offerings
were
subpar
overall
this
being
my
second
rye
beer
experience
i
know
now
for
a
fact
that
i
do
not
like
the
flavor
of
rye
lol
o
very
good
but
i
wish
i
could
could
taste
the
rye
more
as
a
fan
of
rye
beers
and
separately
ipas
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
the
beer
has
a
sort
of
whacky
outofbalance
characteristic
the
michigan
hophead
aesthetic
is
in
full
bloom
here
bells
brewery
has
been
setting
the
pace
on
these
overblown
hop
styles
the
problem
with
this
rye
pa
is
that
the
hops
get
masked
by
the
rye
grain
charateristic
sort
of
a
trainwreck
malty
sweetness
isnt
evidenced
by
intent
but
the
result
of
this
combination
is
sort
of
a
sharp
mush
of
bitterness
over
many
beers
this
would
escalate
with
growing
fatigue
on
the
palate
ive
tried
this
on
two
occasions
once
in
the
tap
room
at
founders
and
once
at
a
bar
in
ann
arbor
i
did
not
finish
either
pint
exceptionally
poor
label
art
too
for
founders
on
this
as
well
founders
reds
rye
p
a
45
overall
quite
a
good
beer
very
complex
and
equally
drinkable
the
flavors
are
all
balanced
and
nothing
overpowers
the
drink
definitely
a
great
buy
for
the
10
50
i
paid
for
a
6pack
o
i
am
not
a
hophead
nor
do
i
like
grapefruit
but
this
a
really
well
done
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
overall
a
very
complex
but
at
the
same
time
easy
to
drink
beer
its
more
refreshing
than
expected
great
look
smell
and
taste
make
for
a
very
nice
experience
overall
deep
weathered
copper
orange
in
color
and
murky
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
thin
cap
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
ripe
grapefruit
sweet
malt
rye
and
sweet
dark
fruit
aromas
smooth
creamy
feel
over
the
top
with
lightly
carbonated
tangy
feel
across
the
tongue
citrus
grapefruit
and
herbal
hop
flavors
with
sweet
malt
and
rye
finishes
with
a
sticky
bitter
hop
aftertaste
o
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
because
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
overall
a
very
solid
beer
well
balanced
final
thoughts
just
a
straight
up
good
beer
and
great
example
of
the
style
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
o
just
another
outstanding
offeriing
from
founders
while
im
not
a
pale
ale
fan
founders
has
achieved
the
ability
to
create
balance
and
keep
the
hops
from
being
too
much
at
the
front
a
good
thing
imo
o
it
was
good
but
not
the
best
rye
beer
out
there
even
from
my
limited
experience
still
founders
is
never
a
bad
choice
overall
founders
just
does
the
right
thing
cant
knock
this
beer
even
if
its
not
my
favorite
style
then
again
i
could
say
that
about
most
of
their
beers
deep
reddish
mahogany
with
a
cream
coloured
head
nice
retention
and
a
good
bit
of
lace
nose
has
loads
of
caramel
malts
some
citrus
spicy
hop
qualities
a
bit
of
bready
character
taste
has
bitter
citrus
light
spice
very
nice
fruity
hop
character
and
some
toasty
bread
notes
medium
feel
medium
low
carbonation
delightful
feel
moderate
bitterness
a
very
nice
rye
pale
overall
a
great
rye
ale
great
balance
very
to
easy
to
drink
as
i
said
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
a
damn
tasty
brew
o
love
drinking
this
one
perfectly
balanced
flavors
lack
of
much
carbonation
is
only
complaint
regardless
its
a
great
beer
o
a
fine
tasty
rye
ale
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
really
drinkable
and
nice
without
being
superstrong
overall
is
this
a
case
of
entirely
drinkable
vs
playing
it
safe
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
but
by
that
same
token
it
doesnt
do
much
to
excite
me
i
could
definitely
see
myself
buying
this
beer
a
handful
of
times
a
year
if
it
were
available
on
the
west
coast
and
itd
make
for
a
great
session
beer
but
its
nothing
i
couldnt
live
without
great
rye
beer
thatnleads
the
pack
in
my
opinion
o
a
mighty
fine
brew
indeed
founders
has
certainly
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
once
again
itll
definitely
be
a
beer
ill
seek
out
and
id
definitely
suggest
doing
the
same
plus
at
6
6
its
a
easy
sessionable
beer
and
one
ill
keep
in
mind
for
the
future
i
love
rye
enhanced
beers
anyway
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
encountered
thus
far
my
friend
and
i
didnt
let
the
six
of
em
hand
around
for
long
why
didnt
i
bring
more
home
very
drinkable
refreshing
a
nice
malthop
balance
i
picked
this
one
by
accident
but
it
didnt
disappoint
me
i
dont
usually
care
for
this
style
but
the
malty
character
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
leftover
in
my
nose
made
this
beer
enough
of
a
happy
accident
i
wouldnt
do
it
twice
overall
i
like
this
but
judging
from
reviews
i
think
its
a
bit
dated
being
that
i
should
have
a
bigger
hop
presence
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
founders
never
dissappoints
full
disclosure
i
am
not
a
huge
red
rye
fan
but
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
class
founders
always
puts
out
quality
beers
o
i
love
this
beer
happened
to
fall
upon
it
without
knowing
much
about
its
beer
advocate
ratings
but
man
this
beer
is
real
good
i
love
founders
www
brewreviewboston
blogspot
com
i
had
the
founders
red
rye
ontap
poured
straight
it
had
a
good
head
light
and
semitransparent
the
smell
was
excellent
and
perhaps
my
favorite
part
of
this
drink
it
was
so
fragrant
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
that
my
group
of
friends
commented
on
the
smell
upon
its
arrival
it
was
highly
carbonated
crisp
and
fresh
tasting
staying
true
to
its
citrus
scent
the
taste
was
equal
parts
citrus
and
floral
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
both
recommend
it
and
have
it
again
overall
this
is
such
a
great
example
of
balance
and
complexity
such
a
tasty
brew
and
available
yearround
this
is
a
must
try
not
too
sweet
too
tart
too
bitter
too
dry
too
alcoholic
which
is
perfectly
hidden
this
really
is
the
best
of
all
worlds
2
thumbs
way
up
cheers
o
a
good
ipa
overall
nice
flavor
and
aroma
profile
has
nice
malty
flavors
while
still
giving
in
to
a
nice
hop
bitterness
everyone
loves
one
of
the
better
ipas
that
i
have
had
dark
amber
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
relatively
thin
but
throws
a
lot
of
lace
the
smell
makes
it
immediately
clear
that
this
is
an
ipa
intense
hop
aroma
mainly
of
the
citrus
and
pine
variety
are
dominant
with
caramel
maltiness
and
rye
spiciness
providing
the
base
the
taste
too
is
upfront
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
with
the
citrus
really
packing
a
punch
next
the
malt
comes
in
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
rye
balancing
the
hops
balancing
may
be
a
bit
of
an
overstatement
because
this
one
remains
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
throughout
even
the
finish
is
tinglingly
bitter
the
body
of
this
beer
is
medium
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
there
is
a
bit
of
a
stickiness
to
this
but
its
definitely
not
sweet
because
again
the
hop
character
sticks
around
throughout
leaving
a
dry
tingle
at
the
finish
overall
im
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
maybe
not
exactly
sessionable
but
im
having
a
hard
time
putting
the
glass
down
reds
rye
pale
ale
arrives
ruby
red
in
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
clarity
and
some
lighter
red
highlights
almost
two
fingers
of
foam
crowns
the
beer
and
while
it
fades
quickly
at
first
the
last
third
or
so
hangs
on
for
a
while
theres
definitely
some
lacing
left
clinging
to
the
glass
but
id
classify
it
as
spotty
the
nose
is
disappointingly
mild
but
a
bit
of
caramel
plays
off
spicy
grapefruit
notes
as
aromas
from
the
hops
and
rye
meld
together
the
beers
a
little
more
robust
once
it
hits
my
palate
a
prominent
caramel
note
greets
me
before
a
mild
bitterness
segues
nicely
into
the
spicy
touch
from
the
rye
the
hoppy
finish
has
some
citrus
but
also
a
more
dank
piney
aspect
to
it
the
body
is
just
too
chewy
for
my
taste
and
as
a
result
the
carbonation
struggles
to
cut
through
it
all
and
make
an
impression
reds
rye
pa
is
a
decent
offering
but
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
the
quality
of
most
founders
brews
founders
makes
a
drinkable
pale
ale
no
matter
what
variety
nice
balance
and
depth
without
being
too
much
slightly
hazy
pour
a
medium
brownamber
color
with
a
finger
or
so
of
foamy
white

decent

stone

good

bready

caramel
stone

and
citrus
pine
bitterness
and
a
mildly
sour
twinge
medium
body
wellbalanced
a
very
nice
drink
overall
and
a
great
easilyobtainable
selection
from
founders
im
really
impressed
by
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
often
o
its
another
great
beer
from
founders
its
unique
refreshing
good
buy
a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
a
nice
touch
of
rye
and
hops
the
rye
adds
a
nice
element
of
dryness
that
works
extremely
well
with
the
citrus
a
good
red
a
good
ipa
and
a
good
rye
beer
o
my
first
ryepa
and
im
totally
digging
it
it
is
a
great
combo
and
i
can
see
myself
going
back
for
this
and
venturing
out
trying
some
other
ryepas
i
see
this
beer
being
a
good
session
beer
as
well
as
being
a
great
pairing
with
a
meal
o
a
definite
go
to
for
me
when
im
looking
for
something
on
the
bitter
side
the
rye
defenitely
adds
complexity
to
the
ipa
style
highly
recommend
i
m
a
big
supporter
of
fine
tasting
brews
o
this
is
one
i
will
be
getting
again
i
generally
prefer
beers
with
a
little
lower
abv
but
this
is
delivers
on
taste
and
compares
well
to
ones
with
even
higher
abv

very
very
good
ipa
definitely
worth
trying
for
fans
of
the
style
as
this
brew
has
many
notes
that
one
will
not
find
in
nonrye
ipas
notably
the
spiciness
recommended
o
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
the
smell
was
amazing
just
like
when
adding
hops
to
a
boil
where
this
beer
could
improve
is
with
a
little
higher
ibus
but
otherwise
this
is
a
difficult
beer
to
criticize
this
is
a
beer
loaded
with
flavor
and
it
looks
gorgeous
as
well
nicely
done
this
one
was
a
winner
overall
great
rye
pale
ale
lots
of
smooth
hops
with
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
delicious
never
had
a
founders
i
didnt
like
but
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
and
was
enjoyed
as
a
second
in
a
series
at
lunch
smooth
feel
crisp
taste
less
carbonated
than
i
would
expect
nice
tart
hoppiness
more
citrus
than
pine
definitely
one
i
would
order
again
tasty
though
almost
certainly
too
old
to
be
in
tiptop
condition
the
rye
comes
through
well
lending
a
grainy
bready
character
to
the
beer
plenty
of
yeast
presence
presumably
due
to
age
hops
are
rather
muted
although
a
considerable
bitterness
remains
a
rather
nice
brew
but
im
sure
a
fresh
example
would
be
even
better
well
worth
trying
and
ill
grab
another
if
i
get
the
chance
what
a
flavorful
unique
offering
great
eye
candy
great
flavors
and
a
really
good
balance
on
a
beer
that
would
probably
fit
every
season
i
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
had
to
offer
and
had
never
thought
about
buying
it
it
was
offered
at
a
beer
tasting
by
founders
and
was
surprised
to
find
it
tasted
like
your
standard
pale
ale
it
even
had
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
fruit
taste
and
certainly
no
rye
taste
i
guess
i
would
just
call
this
good
but
not
great
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
from
founders
like
all
of
theirs
that
would
probably
benefit
from
being
more
fresh
ill
get
this
fresh
and
update
sometime
a
golden
color
like
an
ipa
tastes
outstanding
with
complex
maltiness
and
a
mild
but
noticeable
sweet
citrus
flavor
very
drinkable
although
u
might
want
to
drink
no
more
than
7
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
smell
was
that
of
grapefruit
with
floral
character
overall
a
nicely
crafted
beer
hard
to
find
anything
bad
about
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
amber
red
with
a
froffy
white
head
smells
of
nice
sweet
hops
and
grain
with
slight
hint
of
citrus
tastes
of
nice
hop
aroma
with
nice
rye
aftertaste
very
bitter
but
not
offensively
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
for
its
light
body
and
leaves
no
offensive
aftertastes
carbonation
is
fine
overall
a
very
good
beer
every
beer
aficionado
ought
to
consume
a
six
of
this
it
should
be
part
of
your
lifes
beer
experience
pours
a
white
foamy
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
leaving
some
lace
clear
reddish
hue
with
some
brown
and
orange
rust
colored
mostly
hops
on
the
nose
with
bright
citrus
and
secondary
aromas
of
pine
i
love
this
beer
infinitely
session
able
and
food
friendly
quite
hoppy
but
not
dipa
hoppy
with
nicely
balanced
caramel
malt
wonderful
might
be
my
favorite
yearround
founders
a
great
session
ale
here
another
top
tier
example
of
the
style
and
another
great
brew
from
founders
just
a
brilliant
ipa
my
first
foray
back
into
hops
after
a
few
months
in
europe
its
sexy
amber
body
and
frothz
white
head
indicate
that
its
going
to
be
fantastic
and
it
is
aroma
is
big
west
coast
hops
fresh
and
piney
with
a
balanced
amber
malt
profile
and
some
clever
rye
spice
flavor
is
backed
off
a
bit
on
the
rye
much
more
hope
forward
which
is
delicious
not
sure
the
varieties
but
its
something
high
alpha
the
rye
malt
gives
the
beer
a
nice
little
kick
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
also
excellent
its
more
than
medium
on
the
body
perfectly
carbonated
this
is
one
of
the
better
red
india
pales
out
there
i
could
do
a
sixpack
of
this
no
problem
bravo
up
there
with
the
most
drinkable
american
rye
beers
ive
had
it
may
take
second
to
sas
revolutionary
rye
in
my
eyes
which
is
still
strange
to
me
perhaps
if
they
dialed
back
the
hops
a
bit
on
this
one
and
let
malt
come
through
more
itd
be
the
apple
of
my
rye
harharhar
o
i
like
everything
about
this
beer
but
would
only
suggest
a
bit
of
tweaking
on
the
mouthfeel
i
would
still
get
this
again
overall
always
been
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
like
the
balance
between
rye
and
hops
i
will
definitely
have
another
i
will
seek
this
time
and
again
tastes
fanatasic
everything
i
hoped
for
and
more
perfect
balance
of
malt
hop
and
bitterness
no
tacked
on
gimmicky
flavor
to
finish
it
off
just
disappears
down
your
throat
leaving
the
sides
of
your
tongue
just
a
little
bitter
and
begging
for
another
sip
of
this
exceptionally
balanced
beer
not
too
watery
and
just
crisp
enough
o
this
is
different
tasty
another
good
beer
from
founders
glad
i
have
one
more
poured
from
a
newly
tapped
keg
the
beer
poured
well
with
a
nice
firm
head
overall
color
was
reddishbrown
and
nice
clear
viscous
semitranslucent
appearance
easy
roll
and
good
mouth
feel
balanced
hop
taste
and
a
bit
of
very
light
sweetness
as
the
beer
temperature
rose
during
drinking
very
smooth
and
balanced
taste
initial
heavy
hop
feel
from
first
sip
faded
and
became
more
balanced
with
subsequent
tasting
the
smell
was
average
nonfloral
and
simple
however
the
taste
offset
the
nose
and
delivered
a
solid
ipa
taste
without
an
aftertaste
a
solid
beer
o
another
great
beer
from
founders
no

there
satisfying

with

this
is
my
kind
of
beer
o
reds
rye
p
a
is
a
pretty
complex
brew
with
lots
of
both
worlds
malt
hops
and
spices
are
all
paired
very
well
and
allow
for
a
tasty
beer
i
cant
really
say
anything
bad
about
anything
ive
had
brewed
by
founders
and
reds
rye
is
no
different
its
a
must
try
for
anyone
and
one
you
can
continue
to
grab
year
round
without
any
doubt
very
nice
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
orange
in
tint
with
a
small
head
and
some
lacing
smell
is
pleasant
and
it
has
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
taste
is
fairly
complex
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
progressing
to
a
bitter
rye
flavor
on
the
backend
worth
a
taste
for
sure
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
it
smells
phenomenal
with
a
great
hop
profile
that
is
layered
with
toasted
and
sweet
malt
and
spicy
rye
and
the
taste
follows
this
great
aroma
well
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
founders
strikes
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
some
very
fine
lacing
scents
of
floral
hops
rye
and
citrus
taste
is
similar
to
nose
with
a
perfect
balance
of
floral
hops
rye
and
a
hint
of
nuttiness
mouthfeel
is
really
fantastic
as
its
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
its
just
right
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
again
another
hit
from
founders
pretty
much
the
staple
of
the
rye
pa
style
like
most
founders
beers
recommended
ill
definatly
be
buying
more
of
this
overall
an
outstanding
beer
that
ill
continue
to
get
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
pick
it
up
if
you
havent
already
o
great
rye
beer
great
ipa
great
red
whatever
the
hell
style
it
is
its
a
great
drink
founders
definetly
does
not
fuck
around
with
their
brews
o
this
is
really
enjoyable
it
was
one
of
the
first
rye
beers
that
i
ever
had
back
in
the
day
and
it
really
turned
me
on
to
the
style
i
will
drink
this
over
and
over
again
hands
down
my
favorite
rye
beer
not
only
because
of
the
obvious
amazing
west
coast
ipa
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
but
because
of
just
how
tasty
that
malty
sweet
rye
is
as
im
sure
others
can
tell
you
this
is
just
all
around
a
really
great
beer
nice
and
hoppy
great
beer
overall
another
rye
beer
to
add
to
the
list
would
be
interesting
to
see
a
variety
of
hops
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
amarillo
will
be
enjoying
more
of
these
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
mainly
grapefruit
with
caramel
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
pure
hop
bitterness
which
completely
overpowers
the
palate
its
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
leaves
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
founders
reds
rye
pa
is
a
disappointing
onedimensional
beer
not
recommended
this
is
an
excellent
beer
even
with
being
on
the
thick
side
for
a
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
brew
i
had
one
to
try
then
another
then
another
wow
this
beer
is
delicious
bit
west
coast
hop
profile
on
the
nose
pine
citrus
wonderful
sip
starts
with
that
flavor
then
transitions
into
the
wonderful
taste
of
the
rye
which
is
big
but
still
spicy
great
mix
of
spice
and
sweet
hops
carry
the
whole
time
nice
clean
finish
for
such
a
crazy
beer
really
just
wonderful
o
its
a
great
rye
pale
ale
the
rye
doesnt
take
over
and
is
well
balanced
with
all
the
other
flavors
httpwww
dudeletter
comp2071
this
isnt
as
hoppy
or
as
ryefilled
as
some
others
of
this
style
but
it
works
really
well
this
is
quite
possibly
the
most
drinkable
rye
beer
ive
ever
encountered
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
overall
an
excellent
beer
but
in
the
rye
beer
stakes
i
think
that
bear
republics
hop
rod
is
a
bit
better
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
stronger
rye
flavour
overall
this
is
my
personal
favorite
of
the
rye
pas
and
objectively
an
exceptionally
well
crafted
brew
the
rye
and
grapefruity
hops
blend
so
well
together
it
is
almost
like
its
own
flavor
too
bad
founders
has
a
relatively
small
distribution
area
if
you
are
in
that
area
and
havent
yet
tried
this
shame
try
it
cheers
o
a
decent
rye
beer
nice
combination
of
hops
and
rye
o
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
rye
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
what
a
great
surprise
founders
does
it
again
this
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
that
has
just
enough
rye
malt
flavor
to
complement
the
hoppyness
overall
this
is
a
must
try
i
remember
grabbing
this
on
tap
at
founders
and
hating
it
because
i
was
a
beer
noob
i
couldnt
handle
the
bitterness
i
decided
to
grab
a
bottle
down
in
sc
sad
that
i
moved
away
from
founders
and
this
second
go
at
it
really
was
impressive
it
has
all
the
hops
of
an
ipa
without
the
great
amount
of
floralness
the
way
the
beer
handles
on
the
palate
is
perfect
certainly
a
must
try
o
i
am
shocked
that
this
is
one
of
the
last
brews
from
founders
that
has
made
it
to
my
fridge
bursting
with
almost
chewy
fruit
and
rye
flavor
this
is
a
must
try
overy
well
balanced
beer
with
excellent
rye
flavor
definitely
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
i
have
had
and
the
first
i
have
had
from
founders
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
a
nice
burst
of
fresh
fleshy
grapefruit
followed
by
a
bitter
rye
punch
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
there
is
an
elusive
malt
backbone
in
the
background
holding
the
deliciousness
together
this
is
an
excellent
beer
full
of
flavor
that
leaves
your
mouth
yearning
for
more
pours
a
crystal
clear
reddish
orange
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
spice
and
pine
with
bits
of
citrus
and
caramel
coming
off
of
the
edges
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
to
a
tee
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
watery
resinous
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
smells
great
for
my
tastes
i
would
have
liked
a
hint
more
body
though
o
very
nicely
balanced
brew
good
hops
have
yet
to
go
bad
with
founders
for
the
style
id
put
it
above
the
sn
3f
versions
but
not
as
good
as
the
2
brothers
with
the
disappearing
bottle
date
im
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
looking
forward
to
my
trip
to
founders
in
a
few
weeks
as
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
founders
beers
overall
would
revisit
this
one
happily
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
id
like
maybe
a
little
more
body
or
carbonation
but
overall
quite
good
id
gladly
have
this
again
b
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
dat
of
041912
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
no
head
zero
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
piney
hops
caramel
and
malts
taste
is
oily
resinous
hops
pine
brown
sugar
malts
and
rye
piney
finish
dry
oily
mouthfeel
very
intresting
beer
for
sure
overall
worth
having
again
o
now
this
is
what
sierra
nevadas
ruthless
rye
should
have
been
sn
i
love
you
to
death
but
ruthless
rye
was
pretty
much
torpedo
with
a
hint
of
rye
and
less
drinkability
ryeflavored
anything
isnt
normally
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
is
pulled
off
incredibly
well
id
love
to
drink
this
one
side
to
side
with
hop
rod
rye
too
poured
a
very
vibrant
red
with
about
a
finger
of
head
into
a
pint
glass
can
smell
a
hint
of
rye
along
with
a
few
qualities
of
a
pale
ale
wow
what
a
taste
i
can
see
why
this
style
is
really
up
and
coming
a
full
taste
unlike
most
ive
ever
had
this
beer
while
aesthetically
pleasing
also
has
such
a
great
flavor
bready
yet
not
overwhelming
o
i
think
the
truth
must
be
told
with
this
tasting
founders
is
that
good
when
it
comes
to
interpretation
of
their
styles
this
rye
beer
is
so
good
with
the
classifications
of
hoppy
flavors
what
a
brewery
what
a
beer
glad
you
are
here
founders
finally
originally
reviewed
10242010
o
very
good
brew
everything
balances
well
and
there
are
some
truly
unique
flavors
that
all
go
very
well
together
would
def
purchase
another
six
pack
of
this
and
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
o
my
favorite
rye
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
founders
perfect
amount
of
rye
to
add
flavor
and
mouthfeel
without
dominating
the
flavor
profile
o
a
very
good
rye
beer
the
touch
of
citrus
helps
bring
out
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
this
creates
an
intense
rye
flavor
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
rye
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
rye
beer
o
very
chewy
almost
like
youre
eating
ny
style
jewish
rye
bread
nice
blend
of
spiciness
bitter
citrus
and
sweet
caramel
malts
not
a
beer
i
would
constantly
seek
out
but
really
glad
i
was
gifted
a
bottle
thanks
tony
overall
another
solid
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
in
the
world
not
their
best
but
pretty
goddamned
good
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
red
ipa
its
got
a
great
hoppy
flavor
with
nice
rye
bread
tastes
ov
this
is
a
great
rye
pa
and
while
sn
rr
is
really
enjoyable
i
definitely
prefer
reds
rye
grapefruit
notes
from
the
amarillo
hops
blend
perfectly
with
the
spice
of
the
rye
and
rich
caramel
malts
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
rye
ipa
style
beer
hops
overpower
the
rye
maltiness
slightly
and
i
wish
the
finish
was
a
little
less
bitter
but
quite
tasty
nonetheless
and
a
solid
beer
to
find
on
draft
in
nyc
o
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
i
have
had
well
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
rye
flavor
and
the
perfect
hoppiness
the
best
of
founders
year
round
beers
imo
i
highly
recommend
it
truthfully
i
am
puzzled
this
really
tasted
like
a
quality
ipa
i
noticed
it
had
the
smoothness
of
a
rye
whiskey
but
i
could
not
notice
the
rye
characteristics
the
beer
smelled
like
founders
centennial
even
i
plan
to
try
more
in
this
style
and
pursue
a
draught
offering
of
this
beer
from
there
i
will
see
if
rye
beer
is
for
me
the
beer
had
a
heavier
feel
to
it
than
expected
but
it
was
probably
right
the
beer
had
good
carbonation
and
was
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
beer
perhaps
a
little
heavy
on
the
hops
and
perhaps
why
in
my
book
the
score
suffers
a
little
but
nonetheless
this
is
one
that
i
will
enjoy
often
overall
so
this
is
a
rye
beer
what
a
treat
another
excellent
beer
from
founders
o
this
is
a
superb
rye
beer
its
incredibly
hoppy
but
the
bold
sweet
malts
and
rye
tend
to
balance
everything
out
very
enjoyable

pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
there
is
a
strong
hop
presence
in
the
nose
the
rye
malt
is
apparent
in
the
upfront
flavor
and
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
pleasant
dry
quality
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
it
looks
beautiful
smells
great
and
the
taste
with
its
sweet
malty
bitterness
and
some
spice
from
the
rye
makes
this
beer
a
must
try
o
im
not
overly
big
on
rye
beer
but
this
one
is
undeniably
well
done
and
tasty
another
hit
for
founders
great
summer
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
burger
fresh
off
the
grill
or
when
youre
chillaxin
with
a
bag
of
chips
watching
the
game
one
of
my
1
gotos
pours
a
deep
amber
red
color
with
a
creamy
just
barely
offwhite
head
aroma
of
spicy
rye
big
piney
hopes
maybe
a
little
grapefruit
peel
flavor
follows
with
big
up
front
bitter
but
quickly
runs
smooth
on
the
palate
into
a
spicy
rye
accented
by
toffee
and
biscuit
malts
the
pine
comes
back
into
play
as
it
goes
down
the
gullet
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
plenty
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
o
overall
this
beer
was
fantastic
great
balance
between
the
rye
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hops
the
rye
creates
such
a
bold
flavor
there
is
really
nothing
else
like
it
o
a
very
bold
and
spicy
pa
much
closer
to
an
ipa
than
some
others
in
this
class
such
as
terrapins
fine
rye
pale
ale
well
crafted
overallfor
me
perfect
im
a
big
rye
fan
and
any
time
that
rye
and
hops
work
togehter
in
this
way
is
very
enjoyable
d
not
a
bad
beer
with
a
nice
rye
character
that
brings
me
back
for
more
not
much
of
an
ipa
but
a
really
solid
red
rye
rye
beer
seems
to
be
on
the
rise
and
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
small
but
growing
heap
that
ive
tried
lately
its
a
good
alternative
to
the
amberaltbiers
that
are
everywhere
these
days
and
this
one
is
especially
worth
hunting
down
the
aroma
is
stiff
with
hops
but
this
sharp
edge
is
filed
down
nicely
in
the
taste
by
the
rye
the
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
in
that
ipadry
manner
but
it
wont
have
you
crawling
across
the
floor
gasping
for
air
as
you
reach
for
your
humidifier
nice
o
another
solid
offering
from
founders
i
dont
particularly
like
the
style
but
this
one
works
well
o
seems
like
a
fairly
middle
of
the
road
beer
to
me
a
bit
too
malt
dominated
and
the
hops
dont
seem
to
compliment
it
all
that
well
among
the
rest
of
founders
offerings
i
wouldnt
particularly
go
after
this
one
again
poured
nice
and
copper
like
a
red
the
smell
is
great
flowery
yet
sweet
with
a
hint
of
earthy
rye
i
think
it
might
be
one
of
the
best
smells
from
a
beer
that
ive
experienced
the
taste
is
just
as
complex
a
slight
carbonation
gives
was
to
a
great
mix
of
hop
malt
and
rye
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
love
the
uniqueness
of
rye
ipas
overall
a
really
good
example
of
a
rye
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
rye
beers
and
comes
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
rye
beer
flavor
of
a
rye
ipa
and
the
smoothness
and
malt
background
and
smoothness
of
a
red
ale
o
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
anywhere
i
go
back
to
this
beer
often
because
its
just
exceptional
i
will
buy
again
and
again
m
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
smooth
o
overall
insane
beer
loaded
with
hops
but
not
overly
bitter
the
rye
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
hops
perfectly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
really
hoppy
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
actually
its
pretty
damn
good
i
love
how
well
constructed
and
flavorful
it
is
pleasure
to
have
keep
drinking
salud
overall
a
very
enjoyable
session
ale
one
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
when
im
back
in
ohio
cheers
o
goes
down
easy
interesting
beer
with
a
unique
character
well
worth
a
try
nonetheless
a
great
treat
a
light
spicy
and
bitter
beer
smells
like
a
dipa
tastes
like
a
light
ipa
not
sure
if
i
picked
out
the
rye
at
all
but
a
nice
beer
interesting
note
leaves
a
slight
coolness
menthol
like
tastefeeling
in
the
salivary
gland
region
im
sure
most
of
you
have
tried
this
delicious
beer
an
easily
attainable
year
round
offering
from
founders
always
freshthey
bottle
date
and
an
almost
session
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
throughout
an
evening
please
try
this
beautiful
beer
if
you
havent
and
cheers
to
founders
once
again
as
they
pull
off
an
impressive
but
at
times
precarious
balance
between
their
year
round
and
highly
in
demand
seasonal
offerings
final
verdict
a
big
winner
it
amazes
me
the
kind
of
flavors
a
brewery
can
wring
from
a
relatively
limited
amount
of
ingredients
im
going
to
be
picking
up
this
in
quantity
as
soon
as
possible
poured

classic

smoothness
wet

drinkable
i
used
to
call
this
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
but
its
not
an
ipa
that
is
sometimes
its
not
all
about
the
hops
but
they
certainly
help
heres
to
this
rye
beer
cheers
o
i
love
this
beer
the
complexity
and
depth
the
rye
adds
balanced
off
w
a
great
blend
of
hops
great
o
a
good
beer
not
quite
worth
hunting
but
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
as
an
extra
in
an
awesome
trade
with
andyavalanche
thanks
a
ton
good
brew
im
not
sure
id
seek
this
one
out
but
where
available
it
is
an
almost
must
have
from
time
to
time
i
hear
so
much
love
for
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
frankly
those
people
must
not
have
access
to
this
one
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
grabbed
this
is
a
mix
and
match
6
pack
and
this
blows
me
away
just
amazing
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
everything
is
balanced
and
where
it
should
be
something
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
overall
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
apas
ive
had
but
there
isnt
anything
really
big
about
it
to
me
other
than
its
rock
solid
flavors
and
the
smooth
delivery
nevertheless
recommended
and
another
deserved
checkmark
on
the
founders
reports
card
o
great
beer
ive
heard
nothing
but
good
things
about
founders
beers
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
i
had
this
beer
with
wood
oven
baked
pizza
and
it
paired
very
nicely
my
favorite
rye
beer
so
far
but
rye
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
for
me
meh
founders
never
fails
mouthfeeloverall
just
under
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
amount
of
fine
carbonatioin
very
smooth
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
beer
forever
but
just
hadnt
gotten
around
to
it
glad
i
did
this
time
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
that
differentiates
from
your
run
of
the
mill
ipa
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
drinkable
and
delicious
o
overall
a
pretty
fine
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
more
often
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
great
fresh
lemons
grapefruit
rye
spiciness
and
pine
taste
has
a
lot
of
spice
but
is
balanced
very
well
with
the
citrusy
hops
and
bisquity
malt
extremely
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
nice
carbonation
and
a
good
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
style
that
doesnt
necessarily
impress
me
most
of
the
time
but
this
is
a
very
good
one
overall
quite
enjoyable
i
have
not
had
many
rye
beers
but
this
goes
down
very
nicely
received
a
12oz
bottle
in
a
local
4
local
beer
trade
it
pours
a
nice
dark
apricot
body
with
a
creamy
head
great
lacing
on
the
grass
it
didtnt
produce
a
strong
aroma
like
i
expected
but
you
get
nice
hoppytropical
fruits
it
has
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
that
is
mildly
hoppy
upfront
but
you
get
a
spice
from
the
rye
towards
the
end
that
highlights
the
hops
im
not
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
but
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
it
locally
o
i
think
i
may
have
just
found
a
new
mainstay
in
my
beer
diet
its
relatively
cheap
michiganmade
and
did
i
mention
that
its
delicious
because
thats
kind
of
important
welltextured
body
good
mix
of
herbalspicy
notes
and
a
very
firm
bitterness
to
help
retain
drinkability
o
this
beer
has
an
amazing
aroma
and
maybe
the
best
aftertaste
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
stays
with
you
really
great
beer
o
this
is
a
very
good
unique
ryeredpa
mishmash
thats
definitively
worth
trying
especially
if
your
an
ipa
lover
d
excellent
beer
good
deviation
from
ipa
doldrum
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
really
like
the
hop
flavoring
in
the
aftertaste
nice
citrus
flavor
with
great
flavoring
all
the
way
thru
i
would
buy
this
again
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
founders
makes
good
ones
and
this
is
no
exception
this
isnt
up
there
with
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
but
if
you
want
a
good
rye
cant
go
wrong
here
m
thick
and
slighly
viscous
oily
hoppiness
taste
very
smooth
flavours
of
rye
and
hops
spicy
and
fruity
a
hit
of
alcohol
heat
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
tailgate
companion
on
a
brisk
day
do
never
extreme
this
fine
pale
ale
extends
itself
masterfully
across
the
continuum
of
of
styleappropriate
qualities
rye
while
a
component
of
the
malt
bill
successfully
joins
an
ensemble
whose
range
includes
toasty
caramel
and
even
slightly
roasty
qualities
hops
are
companionable
to
other
flavors
joining
with
english
yeast
metabolites
especially
well
this
is
an
ale
in
the
truest
sense
an
ale
for
all
seasons
and
occasions
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
pretty
damn
good
example
of
the
style
sometimes
rye
can
be
a
little
overpowering
but
founders
kept
that
in
check
nicely
with
a
good
amount
of
tasty
citrus
hops
and
that
worked
out
pretty
well
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
can
drink
around
three
of
these
but
that
seems
to
be
my
limit
for
this
beer
its
a
good
beer
for
just
about
any
season
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
balanced
it
was
it
had
a
good
amount
of
rye
and
hops
in
it
but
neither
of
them
were
too
overpowering
and
that
made
for
a
really
nice
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
the
creaminess
did
through
me
off
a
little
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
dont
buy
it
often
but
when
i
feel
like
a
rye
beer
it
makes
for
a
pretty
good
and
affordable
choice
i
recommend
this
to
just
about
anyone
and
its
a
must
try
if
your
a
fan
of
rye
beers
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
its
pretty
damn
solid
and
thats
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
this
brewery
it
sucks
that
founders
decided
to
make
this
a
seasonal
i
will
miss
being
able
to
buy
it
year
around
but
i
often
forgot
about
it
which
wont
be
happening
when
it
turns
to
a
seasonal
but
founders
has
to
make
tough
decisions
sometimes
and
i
respect
that
but
it
still
sucks
good
job
guys
its
nice
to
have
a
world
class
brewery
like
founders
in
michigan
they
make
some
damn
good
beer
this
is
my
first
and
only
rye
beer
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
to
malt
is
certainly
prominent
not
sure
id
feel
compelled
to
pick
this
one
up
again
though
powerful
tasting
beer
for
the
abv
couldnt
pick
up
the
rye
distinction
too
much
from
other
ipas
was
trying
to
figure
it
out
founders
makes
some
killer
beers
that
being
said
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
a
great
pale
ale
indeed
they
really
need
to
get
this
stuff
to
ontario
overall
the
beer
wasnt
bad
and
i
seem
to
be
in
the
minority
on
this
one
but
the
beer
just
didnt
work
for
me
on
the
tasting
end
theres
a
very
nice
floral
bitter
scent
with
some
rye
hints
underneath
very
good
but
a
bit
disappointed
if
only
because
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
rye
wallop
its
hoppy
with
hints
of
citrus
very
nicely
carbonated
and
refreshing
this
is
a
beautifully
balanced
ale
with
tons
of
flavor
coming
through
o
its
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
rye
flavor
i
think
the
intense
hop
takes
away
some
of
that
still
good
stuff
though
poured
this
rye
beer
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
produced
a
very
nice
white
head
retention
was
great
lacing
was
also
outstanding
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orangish
brown
color
the
aroma
was
full
of
spicy
rye
citrus
and
piney
hops
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
medium
in
body
very
smooth
drinkableand
full
of
malt
bitter
citrus
hops
spicy
tone
set
by
the
rye
very
nice
for
sure
a
keeper
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
imagine
this
would
go
great
with
a
sandwich
or
some
bbq
in
the
afternoon
especially
if
you
had
a
keg
the
rye
really
shows
through
and
while
i
would
probably
drink
a
hop
rod
rye
instead
this
is
a
very
good
offering
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
smooth
drinking
and
a
nice
flavor
but
the
bitterness
tends
to
overshadow
the
tastier
parts
of
this
beer
and
tends
to
imbalance
it
a
little
i
feel
the
rye
is
wellintegrated
as
well
and
adds
a
nice
kick
to
the
pale
side
of
this
beer
i
havent
had
this
is
a
really
long
time
i
remember
a
lot
more
hop
action
which
leads
me
to
believe
this
is
an
old
bottle
its
still
really
good
but
it
definitely
deserves
a
fresher
review
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
reddish
brown
color
with
a
pretty
good
sized
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
a
little
sticky
and
it
also
has
a
good
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
plenty
of
spicy
rye
mixing
with
floral
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
citrusy
bitter
and
spicy
it
had
a
really
nice
drinkable
mouthfeel
and
it
went
down
really
well
overall
its
ot
my
favorite
founders
brew
but
its
still
pretty
damn
tasty
o
i
was
really
taken
a
back
by
this
beer
it
snuck
its
way
into
my
six
pack
of
centenial
ipa
without
me
even
noticing
im
probably
going
to
head
back
tomorrow
and
see
if
i
can
buy
the
rest
what
a
good
solid
beer
o
im
not
a
big
rye
fan
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
what
else
would
i
expect
from
founders
drinkable
and
good
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
for
my
tastes
o
a
great
combination
of
flavors
that
come
together
in
this
brew
theres
enough
hops
to
make
their
presence
known
yet
its
not
too
much
if
you
like
hops
this
is
your
drinkable
beer
right
here
around
overall
a
superb
rye
beer
with
great
hop
character
o
wow
another
great
beer
from
founders
i
believe
this
is
my
first
rye
beer
and
i
imagine
it
will
be
tough
to
beat
as
the
benchmark
for
the
style
highly
recommended
another
solid
beer
from
founders
a
very
good
go
to
for
a
nice
year
round
beer
o
quite
a
well
balanced
beer
with
lots
of
character
and
depth
o
a
good
brew
could
be
a
bit
nicer
on
the
nose
but
works
nicely
with
the
taste
and
overall
mouth
feel
really
loved
the
appearance
on
texture
of
this
one
o
one
of
founders
best
and
hard
for
anybody
to
beat
this
when
it
comes
to
rye
beer
yet
another
beer
i
opened
and
the
sent
filled
the
room
there
was
quite
the
yeastyrye
aroma
a
nice
color
and
what
a
taste
superrye
flavor
with
just
the
perfect
hint
of
hops
enough
to
taste
it
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
just
a
fantastically
solid
brew
from
founders
per
usual
this
is
very
tasty
and
at
least
my
bottle
tastes
noticeably
better
than
it
smells
the
color
and
taste
explain
why
this
is
a
benchmark
for
this
style
of
beer
amber
color
head
retention
is
ok
aroma
is
nice
and
spicy
cloves
maybe
tastes
kind
of
like
rye
bread
the
malt
character
is
quite
different
from
any
amber
ales
or
ipas
ive
had
quite
pleasant
nice
hoppiness
balanced
bitters
at
the
end
nice
aromas
up
front
carbonation
is
low
finish
is
medium
nice
but
i
have
a
feeling
my
bottle
might
be
a
little
low
a
stronger
carbonation
wouldve
made
this
a
much
more
pleasant
experience
i
will
leave
it
to
the
pros
to
break
it
down
structurally
and
simply
say
this
jewel
is
beautiful
light
to
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
small
bubble
carbonation
that
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
easy
drinking
and
tasty
rye
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
tried
overall
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
the
very
general
rye
style
though
really
this
could
be
thought
of
as
an
ipa
more
than
anything
else
another
great
job
by
founders
and
one
of
my
personal
goto
easy
to
get
beers
for
hoppy
styles
along
with
2hearted
and
hop
notch
pours
a
rust
burnt
orange
red
color
with
a
light
khakicolored
head
about
two
centimeters
of
foamy
bubbles
form
during
the
pour
and
large
strandspatches
of
sticky
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
as
the
level
subsides
the
ruby
hues
in
this
one
are
gorgeous
the
aroma
is
of
rye
ample
caramel
malt
grapefruit
orange
and
some
faint
herbal
notes
the
caramel
really
shines
through
in
the
nose
reminiscent
of
a
malty
amber
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
an
added
emphasis
on
the
citrus
especially
at
the
end
the
rye
is
balanced
well
with
the
caramel
flavors
and
some
muddled
herbal
undertones
round
it
out
nicely
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
smooth
going
down
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
a
finish
that
leaves
you
wondering
if
you
really
did
just
take
a
drink
certainly
one
that
keeps
you
coming
back
and
just
a
great
beer
overall
pours
an
inviting
tawny
red
color
the
beer
retains
a
carbonated
head
quite
well
the
aroma
is
incredible
bright
fruity
hops
creamy
caramel
malt
sugar
and
a
savory
undertone
the
taste
is
very
complex
it
thrilled
my
tastebuds
the
flavor
begins
sweet
and
spicy
all
at
once
its
fresh
towards
the
middle
and
fades
to
a
dry
and
pleasant
bitterness
leaves
one
wanting
more
light
mouthfeel
compares
very
favorably
to
other
rye
beers
o
awesome
beer
i
love
rye
in
beer
while
everyone
else
is
caught
up
in
the
cbs
chaos
ill
happily
stick
to
reds
rye
if
and
when
because
i
always
do
need
my
founders
fix
o
great
rye
beer
with
a
nice
hop
bite
not
too
complex
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
emphasis
on
the
bittering
hops
just
enough
malt
backbone
to
smooth
things
out
nicely
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
not
cloudy
but
definitely
opaque
off
white
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
nose
is
really
nice
lots
of
citrus
and
a
touch
of
pine
a
hint
of
rye
spiciness
and
a
surprisingly
strong
malt
backbone
as
it
opens
up
i
get
a
touch
of
earthiness
it
actually
reminds
me
of
a
mcdonalds
hashbrown
taste
is
strongly
bitter
but
not
overpowering
it
is
balanced
with
spice
and
a
small
amount
of
caramelly
malt
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
good
carbonation
overall
a
really
tasty
brew
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
wherever
i
am
o
decent
beer
i
feel
like
i
might
have
drank
a
bad
bottle
because
i
remember
this
being
a
lot
better
either
that
or
my
palate
has
changed
tremendously
since
the
first
time
i
drank
this
other
than
that
still
a
solid
beer
from
founders
a
damn
nice
beer
quite
balanced
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
theres
plenty
of
complexity
to
keep
you
interested
while
still
being
easy
to
drink
anyone
looking
for
a
solid
ipa
spiced
up
with
a
confident
malt
profile
give
it
a
shot
d
this
one
lives
up
to
the
hype
of
being
a
simple
delicious
ryeforward
beer
at
6
6
its
impressive
in
flavor
and
body
overall
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
consider
having
another
go
with
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
next
to
a
nice
rye
whiskey
meh
enjoyable
beer
but
just
reminds
me
really
of
better
beers
in
the
same
vein
o
another
winner
from
founders
hoppy
enough
to
make
a
fan
of
ipas
happy
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
with
the
rye
thrown
in
there
a
cloudy
deep
orange
brown
colored
brew
with
a
healthy
big
bubbled
offwhite
head
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
says
cat
piss
hops
a
little
grassy
citrus
bite
and
a
little
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
brings
sharp
hop
bite
lemon
and
grapefruit
over
what
i
find
to
be
a
proper
rye
bread
touch
its
finely
but
prominently
carbonated
in
a
mediumlight
bodied
brew
awesome
really
nice
beer
and
big
when
it
comes
to
flavour
plenty
of
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
and
nicely
balanced
it
could
actually
show
off
the
rye
a
little
bit
more
but
that
also
might
make
it
more
gimmicky
rather
than
having
everything
integrated
as
it
is
right
now
o
decent
brew
but
the
complex
aroma
led
me
to
high
hopes
the
taste
didnt
match
to
my
surprise
with
that
being
said
i
know
this
isnt
the
most
fresh
offering
so
ill
take
that
into
consideration
huge
rye
fan
and
always
try
something
when
i
see
the
word
rye
this
beer
is
just
not
big
enough
for
it
to
be
great
to
me
and
no
bigger
doesnt
mean
better
to
me
but
i
feel
this
way
with
this
one
o
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
last
time
i
had
some
i
looked
all
over
the
place
to
find
some
with
bottle
dates
but
the
last
shipment
must
have
missed
that
step
at
founders
a
really
hoppy
interesting
rye
pale
ale
when
fresh
decent
at
this
age
o
this
is
what
i
would
call
a
complex
beer
i
can
see
it
pairing
with
so
many
foods
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
just
looked
a
touch
better
edit
second
bottle
on
10132011
and
most
of
my
thoughts
stay
the
same
on
the
tongue
i
taste
a
bit
more
malts
than
i
remember
with
a
nicely
balanced
piney
hop
flavor
overall
this
an
incredible
beer
an
instant
favorite
i
will
always
pick
some
of
this
up
if
its
fresh
i
hope
to
find
this
on
draft
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
as
it
recedes
the
smell
is
amazing
amarillo
hops
with
a
rye
backbone
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
amarillo
flavor
coming
through
followed
by
the
rye
malt
and
finished
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
and
just
right
overall
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
out
there
o
while
its
no
nugget
nectar
i
can
easily
say
that
this
is
the
second
best
rye
beer
ive
had
to
date
it
has
just
enough
citrus
notes
to
break
the
mold
of
the
malty
rye
style
and
i
prefer
it
to
any
of
the
founders
ipas
great
beer
o
another
great
beer
by
founders
as
is
the
norm
certainly
would
seek
this
out
again
if
the
mood
struck
me
d
very
drinkable
the
rye
flavor
here
is
very
nicely
balanced
and
incorporated
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
hop
flavors
especially
work
together
nicely
with
the
rye
flavor
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
still
have
never
been
disappointed
by
a
beer
from
founders
very
complex
beer
here
the
rye
is
noticeable
but
this
is
definitely
closer
to
an
ipa
than
an
all
out
rye
ale
with
the
intense
hop
character
nice
twist
on
an
ipa
though
a
must
try
for
all
hop
heads
overall
my
bottle
was
a
little
out
of
date
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
god
a
big
unique
taste
that
keeps
the
beer
interesting
all
the
way
through
i
imagine
i
didnt
get
a
whole
lot
of
hop
bitterness
due
to
the
age
of
the
bottle
so
i
will
surely
revisit
this
beer
again
when
i
find
it
fresh
o
a
solid
rpa
good
profile
pretty
easy
to
quaff
6
6
and
overall
well
rounded
yet
surprisingly
complex
o
decent
beer
ive
had
a
few
rye
ipas
of
late
and
this
one
certainly
stacks
up
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
every
now
and
then
b
pours
a
hazy
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
fruits
and
citrus
zest
and
some
ryemalt
taste
is
of
bitter
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
and
a
malt
and
rye
backbone
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
rye
beer
with
some
very
nice
citrus
aromas
and
tastes
quite
good
was
my
goto
at
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
in
richmond
overall
an
excellent
beer
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
believe
this
further
solidifies
founders
as
an
awesome
brewery
overall
a
fantastic
brew
hops
overwhelm
the
rye
component
a
little
but
overall
a
good
match
o
this
is
drinkable
delicious
and
well
crafted
it
was
9
for
a
6
pack
in
michigan
ill
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
m
medium
body
with
creamy
flow
good
warming
and
mouth
coating
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
just
another
solid
beer
from
founders
you
can
pretty
much
expect
a
solid
brew
from
them
every
time
yes
indeed
i
would
buy
this
again
and
again
o
i
want
to
like
rye
beers
and
some
just
arent
my
thing
but
i
think
i
found
one
that
id
definitely
get
again
many
reviewers
noted
the
twofinger
head
on
this
beer
something
that
was
notably
absent
on
this
bottle
think
i
got
an
old
one
still
good
but
not
as
good
as
it
should
have
been
o
a
very
good
beer
that
fits
this
style
perfectly
founders
did
it
again
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
overall
an
outstanding
beer
rich
in
body
and
taste
and
the
flavors
are
both
bold
and
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
each
component
is
very
good
and
results
in
a
solid
overall
product
that
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
so
intense
that
you
cant
have
another
which
you
will
likely
want
to
do
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
red
beers
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
o
as
others
have
all
said
this
stuff
is
great
on
the
one
hand
you
can
pop
one
any
time
because
it
would
fit
with
pretty
much
any
occasion
yet
it
also
causes
you
to
pause
and
contemplate
it
notes
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
should
be
able
to
create
some
great
food
pairings
with
it
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
were
the
extremely
bold
hop
components
the
floral
and
citrus
came
together
nicely
here
to
yield
a
brew
both
earthy
and
refreshing
where
this
one
lost
points
was
in
the
diminished
red
rye
components
it
instead
seemed
more
like
a
unique
ipa
or
dipa
with
the
hop
components
really
taking
the
front
seat
here
and
the
grain
and
spice
taking
the
back
seat
what
a
treat
to
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
fresh
as
can
be
this
bottle
poured
a
rubyauburn
color
with
a
bit
of
foam
that
releases
all
sorts
of
hoppy
citrusy
aromas
reminds
me
of
a
freshly
squeezed
grapefruit
balanced
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
rye
the
taste
of
hoppy
grapefruit
is
balanced
by
a
spicy
rye
kick
and
ends
with
a
bitterness
turned
sweet
just
a
touch
of
chewiness
and
a
drizzle
of
honey
to
round
out
this
engaging
interesting
complex
brew
a
real
treat
overall
my
first
beer
from
founders
and
certainly
not
my
last
hellooo
midwest
brewing
scene
i
can
get
used
to
this
o
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
let
down
for
me
the
acidity
seems
to
just
come
out
of
nowhere
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
this
is
the
intended
state
of
this
beer
however
a
strong
hop
presence
really
seems
like
it
would
dominate
the
beer
in
any
form
currently
the
hop
serves
more
as
a
preservative
than
a
flavor
ingredient
id
like
to
retry
this
but
i
wont
get
my
hopes
up
or
make
it
an
item
id
trade
directly
for
while
there
is
nothing
here
that
is
exceptional
in
itself
the
whole
package
is
a
very
enjoyable
drink
a
session
ale
without
a
doubt
the
lingering
dry
hops
invites
one
to
have
another
sip
and
then
yet
another
and
so
on
until
you
run
out
of
ale
then
you
look
into
the
fridge
to
find
that
there
are
none
left
its
that
kind
of
ale
d
very
hoppy
for
style
kind
of
drowns
out
the
malt
overall
definitely
have
to
give
this
one
a
4
0
overall
its
not
stupendous
but
it
is
very
good
for
this
being
my
first
rye
beer
and
with
no
real
prior
conception
of
the
style
going
in
im
pleasantly
surprised
obviously
im
thinking
this
is
a
hoppier
version
than
most
rye
beers
but
since
i
love
ipasdipas
its
a
very
welcome
iteration
if
you
like
hoppy
beers
definitely
seek
this
one
to
give
it
a
try
medium
bodied
slick
with
good
carbonation
good
for
a
rye
beer
but
it
really
dominates
overall
this
beer
is
very
impressive
as
stated
before
a
wonderful
suprise
indeed
i
was
expecting
just
a
super
hoppy
one
dementional
rye
pale
ale
but
i
thought
wrong
shouldve
known
founders
would
knock
it
out
of
the
park
like
barry
bonds
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
thanks
founders
a
very
good
bitter
rye
beer
certainly
another
fine
founders
beverage
one
worth
seeking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
providing
additional
sting
on
the
palate
there
is
a
definite
stickiness
to
this
mouth
overall
this
is
an
amazing
brew
the
complexities
the
mouthfeel
and
the
aroma
are
all
great
and
really
bring
everything
together
another
great
brew
from
founders
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
awesome
for
its
style
i
was
suprised
that
i
rated
it
this
high
but
i
cant
find
any
reason
not
to
overall
better
then
bells
rye
beer
golden
rye
i
think
and
even
though
i
havent
had
sky
high
rye
from
arcadia
i
cant
see
myself
liking
that
more
then
this
overall
another
solid
offering
from
founders
i
am
glad
that
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
get
and
i
can
find
it
whenever
im
in
the
mood
for
it
on
a
side
note
to
me
this
almost
comes
off
as
a
light
version
of
devil
dancer
that
is
not
a
knock
on
either
beer
because
i
really
enjoy
both
of
them
but
when
drinking
this
beer
it
really
reminds
me
of
devil
dancer
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
toasted
grain
flavor
backing
instead
of
the
typical
sweet
caramel
malt
undertones
i
felt
both
the
bitterness
of
this
pale
and
alcohol
hit
home
a
little
harder
than
what
was
listed
on
the
label
but
no
complaints
here
final
thoughts
its
good
but
it
might
be
a
bit
overhyped
people
act
like
this
will
blow
you
away
its
good
just
not
the
caliber
the
hype
gives
it
sets
the
bar
for
every
genre
of
beer
that
they
create
everything
that
i
have
tried
from
them
thus
far
is
nothing
short
of
spectacular
and
top
notch
in
whatever
beer
category
they
are
pursuing
this
rye
beer
from
them
is
no
exception
the
other
rye
beer
i
tried
from
another
local
brewery
was
nothing
compared
to
the
simple
complexity
and
amazing
balance
that
this
beer
has
this
beer
is
available
year
round
because
it
is
just
awesome
it
needs
to
be
available
anytime
you
want
a
quality
rye
beer
another
win
from
founders
do
they
ever
do
anything
that
is
subpar
o
d
its
decent
will
have
to
try
it
fresher
an
excellent
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
it
tastes
ok
but
its
just
not
doing
it
for
me
right
now
cant
really
recommend
o
maybe
this
beer
was
overhyped
for
me
but
i
dont
find
anything
exceptional
here
still
its
a
good
enough
beer
and
id
be
keen
to
try
another
one
to
see
if
this
was
a
oneoff
poor
experience
in
its
current
form
not
recommended
this
is
a
great
brew
the
aroma
is
wonderful
the
flavor
balance
can
be
noted
from
the
first
taste
it
is
nearly
perfect
and
flavorful
overall
another
excellent
founders
beer
definitely
will
buy
again
m
creamy
and
smooth
o
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
deserves
a
place
in
any
alelovers
rotation
definitely
a
westcoast
style
brew
a
solid
ba
for
me
i
just
wish
i
could
get
this
in
my
area
pours
a
amber
brown
w
small
head
and
left
lace
patches
down
glass
a
strong
sweet
malt
smell
of
caramel
and
rye
and
a
fruity
hoppy
smell
as
well
smooth
and
creamy
with
caramel
notes
and
some
other
sweetness
slightly
sticky
theres
a
dry
citric
hop
flavor
that
passes
over
but
it
is
balanced
well
and
finishes
dry
and
crisp
an
easy
to
drink
beer
o
im
hoping
theres
something
wrong
with
my
bottle
or
something
and
i
can
retry
this
and
get
the
nose
to
be
the
mouth
on
this
one
as
it
is
though
the
bitterness
is
nearimpossible
to
get
past
to
find
some
enjoyment
in
this
beer
o
a
tasty
rye
p
a
but
not
particularly
memorable
i
am
a
hop
head
but
the
hops
are
lingering
long
after
the
last
swallow
again
surprising
for
70ibus
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
if
i
had
normal
access
to
it
would
add
it
into
my
regular
beer
rotation
do
another
treat
from
founders
id
place
two
brother
cane
and
ebel
in
the
same
category
and
prefer
that
but
would
rate
this
right
below
it
great
beer
overall
though
o
really
a
good
beer
complex
nicely
balanced
not
only
worth
drinking
but
worth
going
out
of
your

on
the
whole
an
interesting
rye
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
hopforward
for
my
liking
if
there
was
a
bit
more
balance
to
it
the
other
flavors
could
really
come
out
and
provide
a
counter
to
the
bitterness
which
came
across
as
almost
seething
at
times
i
would
probably
revisit
this
beer
given
the
chance
but
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
oexcellent
rye
beer
with
great
balance
and
finish
to
be
savored
for
its
obvious
quality
and
craftmanship
mouthfeel
is
just
about
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
giving
clean
and
crisp
qualities
to
it
very
balanced
and
flavorful
reminds
me
of
nugget
nectar
to
a
certain
degree
actually
want
to
give
huge
thanks
to
the
gentleman
who
shared
this
with
me
while
i
was
at
rnh
and
opened
my
eyes
to
this
beer
o
its
alright
maybe
rye
beers
arent
my
thing
its
ok
wont
drink
it
again
though
o
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
beer
is
really
nice
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
havent
tried
it
another
victory
from
the
guys
at
founders
drink
this
was
a
welcome
gift
i
had
wanted
to
try
it
for
a
long
time
and
was
not
let
down
it
was
spicy
malty
rye
hoppy
a
lot
of
flavors
that
works
well
i
gave
this
beer
extra
points
in
the
overall
category
because
while
its
not
particularly
amazing
in
any
one
way
the
combination
really
shines
not
too
much
spicy
rye
not
a
hop
bomb
ipa
not
too
wussy
but
not
too
heavy
just
all
around
well
balanced
and
tasty
sometimes
its
hard
to
find
good
beers
that
arent
extreme
in
one
way
or
another
mo
this
beer
has
a
semidry
taste
in
the
mouth
and
is
a
little
sticky
but
overall
a
good
beer
and
another
winner
from
founders
ive
been
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
one
and
finally
scored
some
so
far
everything
that
ive
tried
from
founders
has
been
great
and
reds
rye
is
no
exception
this
beer
works
well
on
many
levels
it
has
visual
appeal
with
a
deep
redamber
color
with
a
great
offwhite
head
that
laced
well
the
nose
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
some
malt
and
rye
bleeding
through
palate
is
outstanding
from
start
to
finish
spicy
rye
and
bitter
piney
hops
blast
the
taste
buds
and
are
complimented
nicely
by
the
flavorful
caramel
malts
finish
is
semidry
and
very
bitter
overall
this
is
a
well
made
brew
that
i
could
see
going
well
a
meal
and
one
that
i
look
forward
to
having
again
this
beer
is
outstanding
i
got
this
bottle
about
4
or
5
months
ago
placed
it
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
and
forgot
about
it
its
still
tastes
completely
fresh
and
delicious
all
of
the
flavors
blending
nicely
12
oz
bottle
into
13
oz
tulip
glass
bright
amber
with
a
sticky
off
white
head
really
attractive
beer
hops
biscuit
pine
grapefruit
pretty
pungent
the
taste
is
even
more
forward
then
nose
heavier
then
u
expect
easy
drinking
for
such
a
big
body
really
different
then
most
beers
a
real
treat
due
to
the
bite
i
would
usually
be
able
to
down
one
of
these
before
moving
on
to
something
else
but
that
one
is
quite
good
nice
beer
have
yet
to
find
a
founders
i
dont
care
for
d
a
pretty
standard
hoppy
red
ale
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
lots
of
green
pungent
hops
and
enough
malt
to
to
hint
at
the
thick
sugary
character
of
the
flavor
profile
the
caramel
and
toffee
that
dominate
the
malt
character
work
nicely
with
the
pine
and
grapefruit
hops
but
never
become
excessive
my
only
complaint
is
the
way
the
bitterness
becomes
sharp
and
almost
overwhelming
in
the
finish
to
the
point
that
some
soapy
notes
linger
on
the
palate
after
everything
else
fades
away
this
last
impression
kind
of
ruins
the
drinkability
of
an
otherwise
very
nice
beer
o
overall
this
is
the
second
best
rye
ipa
ive
had
next
to
jester
kings
glad
founders
has
gone
to
the
yellow
dating
ink
on
the
bottles
this
stuff
fresh
is
hard
to
beat
this
is
a
good
one
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
ive
had
up
there
with
hop
rod
rye
reds
is
not
as
sweet
not
as
strong
but
gives
a
big
rich
cornucopia
of
flavors
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
white
head
very
hoppy
smell
and
some
hints
of
the
rye
in
the
nose
great
crisp
hop
flavor
with
some
sweet
rye
notes
this
one
has
a
nice
round
finish
it
says
its
70
ibu
but
i
dont
believe
it
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
this
is
just
a
great
beer
o
pretty
much
my
standard
for
a
rye
beer
and
i
think
the
added
hopping
lends
an
additional
element
love
the
rye
spiciness
through
out
this
is
only
my
second
offering
from
founders
but
damn
they
make
a
quality
beer
have
to
try
more
from
these
guys
this
is
a
good
beer
if
you
see
it
i
recommend
it
as
a
good
pairing
to
red
meat
or
pizza
without
being
too
heavy
just
be
careful
the
abv
is
high
for
this
time
of
year
very
defined
in
flavor
but
open
to
many
new
fans
i
am
one
pick
this
one
up
if
possible
d
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
nice
hoppysweet
taste
to
it
kind
of
like
sweet
and
sour
chicken
is
polar
opposites
in
flavors
yet
it
comes
together
flawlessly
very
easy
to
drink
if
this
was
easily
available
in
california
i
would
make
sure
to
keep
it
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
o
this
beer
rocks
its
a
real
treat
best
of
its
kind
and
a
must
try
great
work
yet
again
fonders
overall
though
i
really
love
dipas
and
this
one
swings
with
the
best
ive
tasted
and
i
most
certainly
would
try
it
again
o
a
great
rye
beer
that
truly
proves
that
you
can
pull
off
both
rye
and
aggressive
hopping
in
the
same
beer
check
this
out
for
sure
if
you
can
find
it
this
beer
is
well
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
typically
gravitate
to
hoppy
brews
overall
drinkability
hmmm
good
looking
beer
good
smell
good
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
an
acquired
one
and
im
not
sure
if
ive
acquired
it
yet
maybe
with
the
right
meal
id
enjoy
this
beer
more
well
glad
i
tried
it
and
maybe
i
need
to
revisit
again
when
my
palate
has
expanded
more
im
thinking
that
if
one
is
a
massive
hophead
then
this
beer
really
is
appealing
no
sweetness
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavors
but
for
me
i
think
i
need
more
malt
to
counter
the
hop
bitterness
pours
an
oakish
red
beautiful
smells
right
from
the
popped
top
strong
citrus
hops
and
caramel
nice
hoppy
citrusy
taste
a
lot
of
caramel
on
the
finish
maybe
a
tad
bit
of
oakiness
to
it
plus
a
dry
bitterness
mouthfeel
actually
feels
a
bit
creamy
quite
full
medium
carbonation
this
is
yet
another
fine
beer
from
founders
i
am
consistently
pleased
with
them
the
more
i
try
d
superb
much
bigger
and
complex
than
it
looked
a
true
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
cant
wait
to
enjoy
another
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
complex
malts
bill
big
citrus
hoppiness
the
rye
and
amarillo
has
a
place
in
my
heart
overallkind
of
pissed
because
it
had
a
lot
of
promise
and
is
still
a
quality
beer
that
i
would
absolutely
drink
again
just
a
little
bit
watery
for
me
nonetheless
go
get
this
beer
if
you
can
taste
is
sweetly
malted
at
first
with
a
bitter
pine
hop
resin
and
grapefruit
in
the
followthrough
good
and
wellbalanced
flavor
definitely
a
solid
choice
for
hop
heads
m
clean
crisp
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
full
of
flavor
not
overwhelmingly
hoppy
or
alcoholic
strikes
off
in
a
different
refreshing
direction
from
typical
ipas
overall
simply
put
a
great
refreshing
beer
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
with
a
variety
of
meals
or
by
itself
on
a
summer
day
as
far
as
rye
ales
are
concerned
this
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
a
good
flavorful
ale
and
though
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
pronounced
hop
kick
its
worth
trying
for
sure
o
stellar
representation
of
the
style
within
all
regards
comes
recommended
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
when
applicable
o
wow
this
is
a
great
brew
ive
heard
a
lot
and
read
a
lot
about
this
one
and
it
did
not
disappoint
at
all
awesome
a
session
brew
to
boot
i
could
see
myself
having
3
or
4
of
these
puppies
in
a
sitting
during
the
summer
very
well
done
othis
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
i
would
certainly
never
pass
it
up
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
overall
drinkability
was
great
but
still
confused
on
the
malt
and
all
of
the
ingredients
used
ive
only
had
a
few
rye
beers
and
am
interested
in
learning
more
about
this
style
will
be
trying
more
in
the
future
could
drink
many
4
of
these
beers
in
one
night
o
interesting
beer
more
bitter
than
expected
quite
good
found
myself
trying
to
pick
it
apart
but
not
many
flaws
in
the
armor
something
didnt
make
me
freak
out
about
it
but
very
good
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
thats
pretty
puny
and
fades
quickly
not
much
lacing
either
popping
the
cap
yields
an
absolutely
intoxicating
citrus
scent
some
tart
apple
grapefruit
and
maybe
some
peach
this
got
my
hopes
up
for
an
exceptional
taste
but
it
didnt
quite
match
up
grapefruit
is
most
prominent
in
the
taste
but
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
from
the
rye
in
the
background
good
nicely
balanced
but
not
outstanding
id
go
for
one
of
these
again
this
beer
rocks
and
it
would
be
a
fantastic
compliment
to
some
of
your
favourite
meat
and
cheese
snackies
a
beer
worthy
of
the
esteem
and
respect

and
easy

i
would
say
this
could
be
a

beer
even
though
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
the
session
beers
an
excellent
summer
beer
overall
hard
to
place
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
some
orange
highlights
1
finger
of
white
bubbles
looks
really
nice
i
smell
hops
pine
and
grapefruit
along
with
some
alcohol
intially
i
taste
the
nice
amarillo
hops
nice
amount
of
pine
and
grapefruit
then
i
taste
some
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
a
little
spiciness
from
the
rye
a
slight
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
some
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
o
this
is
simply
a
phenomenal
rye
and
my
favorite
rye
beer
overall
it
showcases
every
element
and
leaves
me
wanting
little
else
from
this
brew
founders
simply
can
do
no
wrong
the
hebrew
bittersweet
lennys
is
another
excellent
rye
ipa
but
reds
rye
came
out
on
top
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
a
dark
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
leaves
great
walls
of
creamy
lace
the
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
earthy
hops
spice
and
pine
sweet
caramel
hints
in
the
back
with
hints
of
leather
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
nothing
overpowering
a
nice
malty
backbone
of
caramel
and
honey
cut
off
with
a
bitter
sword
of
pungent
pine
followed
by
fruity
tones
of
citrus
and
pear
some
spicy
and
peppery
notes
from
the
rye
complete
a
complex
profile
that
finish
with
some
floralherbal
tones
a
mild
and
easy
to
drink
beer
on
the
hoppy
side
but
nothing
over
the
top
very
mild
and
very
well
balanced
o
absolutely
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
beer
from
founders
my
favorite
rye
beer
that
i
have
had
to
date
i
am
excited
to
try
this
since
i
havent
had
a
rye
since
mild
winter
pours
a
rich
copperamber
with
specks
and
a
sizable
tan
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
on
the
hops
grapefruity
mingled
with
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
soft
wave
of
rye
following
nice
and
bitter
but
i
have
a
hard
time
detecting
the
rye
amongst
the
very
strong
hopping
smooth
body
amongst
crisp
carbonation
refreshing
in
its
own
this
beer
is
great
can
satisfy
many
a
hophead
but
i
want
more
rye
o
a
fine
brew
out
of
the
bottle
and
a
real
treat
to
have
ontap
tops
the
list
at
clark
street
ale
house
tonight
o
not
a
bad
beer
interesting
flavor
and
easy
to
get

wow
at
first
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
rereviewing
it
with
a
fresh
palate
i
can
really
appreciate
it
probably
one
of
the
best
ryes
ive
ever
had
taste
pleasantly
surprised
just
how
much
rye
went
into
this
hopped
well
but
not
trying
to
be
an
ipa
either
well
a
little
bit
reminiscient
of
nugget
nectar
not
as
bitter
but
less
in
the
appearance
of
a
red
as
well
great
interplay
between
the
rye
flavor
caramel
and
the
amarillo
hops
ample
bitterness
is
swallowed
by
the
rye
i
suspect
all
in
all
it
flows
well
together
pours
dark
copper
with
a
whitish
head
that
sticks
around
very
hoppy
nose
with
floral
and
citrus
notes
a
touch
of
pine
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
you
definitely
get
the
rye
character
with
a
nice
robust
hop
profile
finishes
relatively
clean
a
nice
example
of
a
solid
rye
ale
not
life
changing
but
definitely
worth
a
sample
so
pleasing
to
my
hopcraving
taste
buds
i
dont
have
many
ryes
to
compare
it
to
but
this
one
seems
to
be
missing
the
somewhat
wheaty
character
i
find
in
hop
rod
rye
still
amazing
m
each
sip
leaves
you
with
a
pleasant
rolling
bitterness
mediumlight
body
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
tasting
ryeipa
beer
really
awesome
the
amarillo
hops
did
a
wonderful
job
with
this
beer
as
they
do
with
most
beers
the
only
problem
with
the
beer
is
the
too
light
feel
but
like
the
overall
score
indicates
far
from
being
a
deal
breaker
for
me
o
overall
im
confused
but
i
think
i
like
it
its
definitely
an
ipa
in
sheeps
clothes
but
i
dont
quite
know
whats
missing
since
its
a
rye
though
this
is
quite
a
delicious
beer
served
from
bottle
into
a
grolsch
pilsner
poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
remained
throughout
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
subtle
grain
and
subtle
citrus
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
and
slight
grain
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
if
i
am
honest
this
might
have
been
the
best
rye
beer
offering
i
have
had
todate
very
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
the
citrus
aspect
really
blended
well
with
the
grain
aspect
going
on
here
the
aroma
was
very
nice
as
well
on
this
one
a
definite
must
try
pours
a
red
amber
with
hints
of
burnt
orange
and
holds
a
finger
of
fluffy
head
nose
has
grapefruit
pith
upfront
along
with
pine
resin
light
malt
sweetness
to
go
along
with
some
spicy
grain
the
taste
has
some
a
nice
malty
richness
to
go
along
with
rye
bread
citrus
and
pine
forest
finishes
with
a
touch
of
resin
and
pretty
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
compared
to
the
malt
upfront
pretty
straightforward
beer
definitely
good
but
not
really
that
special
o
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
this
beer
and
i
always
will
no
matter
how
many
pas
i
have
in
my
lifetime
i
can
almost
guarantee
that
this
will
remain
amongst
the
top
spots
i
love
this
beer
edit
pairing
sidenote
before
my
second
bottle
was
finished
i
made
some
cheese
pizza
with
lots
of
garlic
and
sriracha
the
beer
stands
up
really
well
to
these
bold
flavors
with
the
sweetness
coming
out
a
lot
more
than
when
i
just
drank
the
beer
on
its
own
this
beer
would
be
a
great
choice
for
pairing
with
hot
and
spicy
foods
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
soon
and
often
wonderful
flavor
spoton
balance
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
why
we
drink
craft
beers
i
could
drink
this
every
day
o
a
good
beer
all
around
i
would
have
to
seen
a
more
assertive
character
though
i
suppose
particularly
in
the
aroma
it
may
be
there
but
is
merely
covered
by
the
hops
that
being
said
its
a
fun
tasty
well
hopped
beer
o
overall
its
an
ok
ipa
but
i
can
get
an
ipa
a
dime
a
dozen
that
taste
like
this
i
would
really
like
more
rye
flavor
to
make
it
unique
doverall
this
was
a
great
rye
beer
had
good
flavors
thoughout
and
was
very
drinkable
could
enjoy
a
6
pack
of
this
anyday
d
the
color
of
an
amber
the
flavor
of
an
ipa
and
the
finish
of
a
rye
beer
overall
very
interesting
beer
pretty
drinkable
indeed
interesting
mix
of
styles
hard
to
put
a
rye
or
any
specific
title
on
it
for
that
matter
d
quite
a
good
offering
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
the
only
downside
is
the
lack
of
aromas
still
an
okay
beer
though
this
is
a
solid
american
pale
ale
though
im
not
sure
how
much
id
want
to
call
it
a
rye
beer
the
hops
are
aggressive
but
tempered
by
the
malt
presence
overall
good
but
id
like
to
see
more
rye
presence
had
this
on
tap
at
shark
club
in
howell
pours
a
deep
amberbrown
colour
with
thick
offwhite
head
tons
of
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
fresh
grapefruity
hops
with
lots
of
bready
malt
base
bitterness
level
is
quite
nice
though
balanced
out
with
the
sweetness
i
think
this
could
be
hoppy
enough
to
be
considered
an
ipa
even
a
really
nice
beer
good
stuff
strong
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
but
a
good
beer
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
on
the
palate
this
is
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
rye
beers
where
you
can
actually
taste
the
rye
presence
amidst
the
other
flavors
another
awesome
beer
from
founders
m
medium
carbonation
and
dry
finish
make
this
beer
drinkable
and
desirable
a
solid
tasting
beer
with
a
deep
flavor
that
holds
your
interest
o
dont
think
rye
bread
think
actual
rye
making
out
with
hops
and
sweating
citrus
a
really
refreshing
beer
akin
to
the
effect
tasty
double
ipas
have
on
me
o
wonderfully
crafted
beer
with
great
balance
and
flavor
i
have
been
hearing
about
this
one
for
a
while
and
am
glad
to
finally
be
tasting
cheers
im
not
a
hophead
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
with
a
reasonable
70
ibus
id
not
drink
2
at
a
sitting
but
will
go
back
to
this
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
fairly
imaginative
and
i
cant
say
ive
had
any
beer
quite
the
same
as
this
and
dont
really
have
anything
in
mind
to
compare
it
to
founders
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
country
if
not
the
best
and
this
is
another
example
of
why
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
as
soon
as
you
can
cheers
overall
a
well
crafted
craft
beer
nothing
offensive
and
tons
of
positives
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
hoppy
also
a
slightly
spicy
rye
flavor
this
is
my
first
time
sampling
this
beer
and
i
think
its
a
wonderful
offering
from
founders
pocked
up
a
sox
via
bierkraft
glad
i
did
it
was
a
sub
for
the
out
of
stock
ruination
but
a
great
new
find
one
of
the
finest
amber
colored
beers
i
have
ever
tried
nice
tannish
head
and
decent
lacing
iny
tasting
glass
the
smell
is
awesome
herbal
delight
of
malts
and
citrus
the
taste
is
great
too
o
dont
always
pick
up
on
subtleties
but
this
is
a
complex
brew
nice
bitterness
of
hops
and
citrus
a
sweetness
and
cooked
malt
combination
well
worth
rhecweek
waiting
for
delivery
mouthfeelis
good
medium
nodded
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
will
try
again
and
again
nut
too
good
to
session
out
due
tonlimited
availability
in
spain
overall
a
good
beer
especially
being
a
rye
beer
but
i
feel
like
it
was
a
bit
overpeppered
and
left
an
unpleasant
burning
sensation
in
my
throat
as
if
i
had
a
sore
throat
o
worthy
of
an
epilogue
the
highlight
of
the
day
citrusy
ryey
delicious
id
love
to
see
more
of
this
2015
notes
i
raised
my
ratings
a
bit
o
what
a
fun
beer
to
have
tried
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
the
regular
version
everyday
but
im
really
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
o
this
was
decent
i
liked
the
rye
element
but
it
was
just
a
little
bland
for
me
maybe
this
isnt
my
style
easily
drinkable
though
mouthfeel
is
creamy
light
and
crisp
with
high
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
sweet
malty
finish
thats
dry
and
crisp
with
the
rye
present
in
a
very
appealing
way
good
drinkability
this
went
down
easy
and
could
make
a
good
session
beer
poured
into
a
mug
a
nice
dark
semi
cloudy
copper
with
red
tints
good
amount
of
off
white
foamy
head
nose
is
dominated
by
sharp
citrus
hops
floral
auroma
with
a
great
balance
of
spicy
notes
and
sweet
malt
taste
follows
the
nose
nice
rye
blend
that
is
subtle
and
replaced
with
sharp
hops
that
are
bitter
at
first
and
mellow
leaving
a
dry
finish
has
a
resemblance
to
an
imperial
amber
flavour
packs
alot
of
flavour
great
tasting
beer
chewy
and
dry
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
i
love
the
label
of
this
beer
overall
nice
drinkability
abv
that
rounds
out
a
very
quality
beer
from
the
makers
of
founders
the
rye
is
subtle
enough
to
keep
it
an
interesting
flavour
profile
and
the
hops
bring
the
brew
to
another
level
almost
perfect
in
my
book
i
havent
had
many
rye
ipas
this
one
is
great
not
as
good
as
hebrew
lenny
bruce
but
very
very
good
its
nice
to
have
an
ipa
with
a
slightly
different
grain
flavor
from
time
to
time
d
probably
the
best
rye
beer
ive
ever
had
another
winner
from
founders
overall
not
bad
but
not
feeling
it
too
much
bitterness
and
high
astringency
for
my
tastes
the
only
thing
actually
bugging
me
about
this
beer
is
the
classification
as
much
as
theres
rye
in
it
i
think
it
should
be
in
the
ipa
category
the
amount
of
rye
i
tasted
was
pretty
slim
or
perhaps
buried
beneath
all
the
hops
i
need
to
try
another
bottle
or
two
to
see
if
mine
is
off
but
it
seems
like
an
ipa
with
a
touch
of
rye
added
o
very
easy
drinking
despite
the
bitter
and
dry
finish
pretty
good
beer
that
im
sure
to
drink
again
o
overall
this
was
awesome
i
love
rye
beers
and
this
one
did
not
dissapoint
o
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
tried
i
like
the
big
citrus
profile
and
the
clean
taste
of
the
rye
could
see
picking
a
six
pack
of
this
up
as
my
go
to
beer
this
summer
dwell
it
doesnt
exactly
have
the
qualities
to
make
this
a
great
drinker
the
tastes
just
arent
something
i
would
want
a
lot
of
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
im
glad
i
did
but
it
isnt
something
i
need
again
very
good
and
easy
drinking
brew
for
the
abv
and
overall
i
thought
it
was
good
not
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
seek
out
and
buy
again
though
its
just
not
amazing
d
this
is
a
good
well
balanced
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
rye
and
malts
comes
through
but
its
clear
in
the
taste
why
they
used
a
play
on
words
in
the
name
rye
p
a
the
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
is
definitely
present
combining
with
the
rye
and
giving
this
beer
a
distinct
flavor
d
it
is
a
fantastic
variation
of
the
i
p
a
one
of
my
favorite
gotos
d
overall
a
solid
beer
i
could
drink
several
in
a
sitting
id
love
to
get
this
by
me
especially
on
tap
d
drinkable
but
not
too
many
for
me
d
not
too
bad
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
the
overall
bready
feel
really
brought
the
drinkability
down
a
few
notches
i
felt
like
i
ate
half
a
loaf
of
hoppy
bread
after
only
one
glass
d
delicious
and
well
crafted
flavors
all
around
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
an
amazing
brewery
on
tap
last
night
at
canary
sq
in
jp
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
shady
orange
colored
body
thin
white
head
smell
was
very
floral
and
citrusy
i
liked
the
flavor
very
much
not
as
hoppy
or
bitter
as
i
was
expecting
hints
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
along
with
fresh
hop
flavors
very
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
body
very
easy
beer
to
drink
the
more
rye
beers
i
try
the
more
i
like
them
add
this
one
to
the
list
of
winners
the
bitterness
seems
higher
than
70
ibus
but
that
may
be
due
to
rye
giving
some
acrid
flavor
tones
to
the
beer
it
reduces
the
drinkability
and
those
who
are
not
lovers
of
strong
ipas
will
find
this
one
a
bit
difficult
to
last
through
d
not
much
out
of
place
to
detract
high
honors
overall
im
really
digging
this
beer
while
i
would
love
for
this
to
be
a
bit
fresher
it
still
taste
great
once
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
certainly
ill
rereview
if
i
get
a
fresh
bottle
pour
red
as
the
name
implies
actually
ruby
with
a
nice
white
head
solid
lacing
smell
is
intensely
hoppy
very
much
like
an
ipa
again
taste
is
also
hoppy
but
not
as
bitter
as
the
hop
profile
would
make
you
think
pretty
good
balance
in
the
flavor
hops
are
on
the
fruity
side
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
slightly
creamy
very
good
brew
from
founders
as
usual
took
me
a
while
to
finally
sit
down
with
one
of
these
but
glad
i
did
full
boded
for
the
style
with
lots
of
dank
resinous
oily
hops
countered
by
a
slightly
toasty
sweet
malt
backbone
nice
hop
presence
up
front
with
a
good
balance
of
earthydry
bitterness
and
sweet
citrus
flavor
hints
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
as
well
as
some
earthy
pine
the
malt
backbone
is
sweet
with
a
prominent
rye
character
as
well
as
hints
of
subtle
caramel
biscuit
and
toffee
really
well
balanced
refreshing
and
insanely
drinkable
with
a
slight
dry
finish
d
could
drink
a
12
pack
soo
tastey
and
still
light
very
dry
easy
to
drink
and
very
good
offering
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
overall
this
is
one
fantastic
brew
just
another
reason
why
founders
is
at
the
top
of
the
hill
when
it
come
to
craft
beer
skal
knowing
how
amazing
founders
is
i
am
going
to
give
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
this
just
isnt
right
because
of
freshness
issues
id
love
to
rereview
this
from
tap
or
a
fresher
bottle
overall
definitely
better
for
rye
fans
d
complex
enjoyable
and
refreshing
rye
adds
a
nice
kick
to
the
hop
character
while
the
malts
round
out
the
brew
with
just
the
right
amount
of
body
and
sweetness
balanced
interesting
and
enjoyable
d
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
complex
as
the
nose
a
little
lemon
pepper
and
a
pinebitter
finish
but
not
as
much
of
the
spicy
complexity
that
i
like
from
a
rye
beer
still
a
fine
quaffable
example
of
the
style
and
well
worth
a
try
d
would
be
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
without
to
much
trouble
drinkability
is
outstanding
and
like
many
founders
brews
iit
is
a
regular
resident
in
my
fridge
no
freshness
date
poured
into
a
bear
republic
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
massive
and
fluffy
orange
head
specks
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
good
retention
lots
of
hops
in
the
nose
with
rye
spiciness
loads
and
loads
of
rye
hit
first
in
the
taste
with
some
piney
hops
and
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
feeling
extremely
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
the
tasty
rye
and
light
mouthfeel
make
this
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
havent
had
many
rye
beers
but
this
one
has
me
interested
in
trying
more
d
most
excellent
not
really
a
session
beer
but
a
great
tasting
high
quality
brew
from
founders
liked
this
one
a
lot
d
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
nice
flavours
d
sessionable
compared
to
the
others
quite
palatable
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
with
the
end
as
mentioned
earlier
herbally
clean
approaches
thin
at
times
but
flirts
with
the
line
well
offering
up
a
delectably
light
yet
fullbodied
texture
drinkability
is
flawless
finish
start
a
great
mixture
of
palate
cleansers
sensitizers
that
cant
be
topped
nothing
is
too
strong
nothing
is
too
weak
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
said
i
guess
top
top
beer
regardless
of
style
d
good
on
hot
days
served
about
50
degrees
great
with
bbq
i
drink
some
every
month
this
is
a
very
pleasant
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
beer
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
rye
beer
ive
had
the
rye
elements
here
work
well
with
belgian
malts
and
whatever
hop
they
used
very
good
drinkability
is
very
high
d
i
thoroughly
enjoy
how
these
flavors
work
together
they
blend
so
nicely
while
being
distinguishable
at
the
same
time
and
result
in
an
excellently
balanced
beer
i
could
drink
another
one
or
more
to
continue
exploring
this
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
dont
think
i
would
buy
a
case
but
definatly
another
6er
this
is
my
first
rye
beer
alot
like
an
ipa
i
would
recommend
this
brew
another
good
offering
from
founders
d
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
overall
would
certainly
drink
again
and
could
see
it
being
in
the
rotation
if
available
in
my
area
ddrinks
like
a
good
ipa
with
a
slight
spicy
note
reminiscent
of
hop
rod
rye
d
goes
down
easily
with
no
detectable
alcohol
a
complex
flavor
and
the
uniqueness
lent
to
it
by
the
rye
this
beer
is
enjoyable
for
a
long
time
and
one
that
ill
be
returning
to
soon
another
treat
from
founders
i
think
i
already
prefer
it
to
their
standard
ipa
and
its
at
least
on
a
par
with
double
trouble
d
full
of
taste
and
drinkability
youll
want
to
stock
up
on
this
one
drinkability
was
where
this
beer
seemed
to
falter
as
much
as
i
respect
the
style
the
combination
of
dry
bitter
hops
and
sour
rye
notes
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
handle
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hop
rod
rye
and
other
super
hoppy
rye
beers
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
as
well
drinkability
rye
does
interesting
and
wonderful
things
to
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
the
balance
of
wet
juicy
hops
and
rye
is
amazing
founders
executes
well
and
this
is
welcome
anytime
in
my
fridge
its
a
little
heavy
to
drink
6
of
them
at
once
but
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
another
one
the
6
6
alcohol
is
well
hidden
increasing
the
drinkability
d
yup
pretty
nice
definitely
would
rock
it
as
a
session
beer
the
rye
was
a
new
twist
for
me
and
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
redamber
into
your
glass
with
a
one
finger
cream
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
based
on
the
aromas
this
beer
gives
off
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
guess
this
was
an
ipa
and
not
a
pa
it
begins
bitter
before
ending
sweet
and
malty
it
has
excellent
flavor
which
tends
to
be
more
on
the
malty
side
the
hops
arent
as
big
of
a
characteristic
as
they
could
be
it
is
sweet
and
has
a
different
accent
to
it
as
well
im
guessing
thats
the
rye
it
drinks
very
crisp
and
has
good
carbonation
its
between
light
and
medium
in
body
and
drinks
well
its
very
good
for
the
style
and
an
exceptional
brew
overall
a
really
great
beer
acidity
might
stand
some
tinkering
but
really
a
great
beer
i
plan
on
getting
this
one
again
a
wonderful
beer
with
great
flavor
i
love
that
the
flavors
are
distinct
and
have
a
delightful
balance
of
hops
and
malt
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
drinkability
a
very
under
appreciated
beer
from
founders
by
me
i
often
overlook
this
for
their
other
offerings
but
this
is
a
very
solid
rye
based
beer
overall
ive
already
said
it
this
on
is
in
my
top
10
for
sure
very
drinkable
great
taste
great
balance
keeps
you
coming
back
definitely
my
top
rye
beer
highly
recommended
d
yet
another
solid
offering
from
the
brewers
at
founders
well
constructed
and
worth
a
try
had
this
in
a
bar
that
didnt
seem
like
they
would
have
a
micro
but
they
had
reds
rye
so
boy
was
i
happy
when
i
found
this
and
with
that
it
feels
and
tastes
like
one
too
typical
hop
and
grapefruit
associated
with
an
ipa
in
finish
palate
and
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
unique
for
a
rye
beer
but
this
is
still
tasty
however
it
feels
like
just
another
good
solid
american
ipa
instead
of
something
distinct
cant
say
i
am
blown
away
by
it
either
so
i
am
going
to
probably
never
desire
this
again
d
very
good
overall
beer
love
the
play
between
the
rye
and
hop
character
and
balance
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
not
world
class
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
i
dont
get
as
much
rye
as
id
like
its
a
very
enjoyable
and
dryenough
grapefruit
beer
md
this
is
a
bit
thicker
than
the
centennial
it
gives
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
definitely
makes
you
feel
like
its
a
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
it
incorperates
everything
an
ipa
would
have
but
adds
a
bit
more
with
the
rye
d
as
high
as
it
gets
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
in
stores
here
in
atlanta
but
i
am
keeping
my
eyes
open
overall
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
all
the
time
i
would
buy
6
packs
but
i
dont
so
i
dont
think
i
will
trade
for
it
again
good
to
try
it
though
d
i
had
a
sixer
but
never
went
past
2
in
one
sitting
at
first
it
appears
almost
sessionable
because
it
is
quite
smooth
going
down
however
the
dry
finish
lingers
a
bit
this
beer
would
be
great
at
lunch
with
a
reuben
or
other
deli
sandwich
d
good
beer
a
bit
too
much
going
on
in
the
bottle
wish
the
amarillos
were
balanced
with
something
else
will
not
seek
out
but
wouldnt
turn
down
either
drinkability
the
full
taste
of
this
beer
makes
it
a
sipper
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
but
its
not
difficult
to
drink
by
any
means
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
unrelenting
yellowish
white
head
with
a
ton
of
lacing
smells
of
hops
and
rye
tastes
of
piny
hops
rye
and
a
little
caramel
malt
in
there
bitterness
is
just
right
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
carbonation
drinkability
is

well
best
founders
beer
to
date
the
cpj
d
ive
always
considered
this
to
be
one
of
my
goto
brews
available
in
my
area
this
is
a
craft
beer
lovers
candy
beer
for
sure
this
is
my
first
taste
of
founders
brewing
and
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
i
am
usually
bound
to
buy
the
typical
belgium
trippels
and
quads
but
this
bottle
struck
my
eye
at
total
wine
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
and
it
tastes
fantastic
the
carbonation
is
not
overpowering
and
you
can
taste
the
rye
and
hops
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
see
myself
buying
in
the
future
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
pours
a
bright
hazy
amber

faint

sweetness
quickly
gives
way
to
faint

this
was
an
excellent
brew
that
i
wish
was
available
locally
dsurprisingly
very
drinkable
never
really
enjoyed
a
rye
beer
but
this
one
definitely
makes
me
think
twice
about
the
style
i
cant
really
get
over
the
drinkability
i
guess
that
is
why
it
is
near
the
best
rye
beer
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
for
a
hoppy
beer
finished
a
glass
with
no
difficulty
drinkability
very
refreshing
when
your
in
the
mood
for
something
light
smooth
easy
drinking
bountiful
hop
character
but
not
overly
bitter
interesting
and
creative
i
like
it
d
i
really
enjoy
this
one
however
the
rye
factor
only
seems
to
give
an
otherwise
solid
ipa
a
crispness
it
otherwise
might
not
have
that
is
i
was
hoping
for
a
rich
spicy
character
that
i
didnt
find
that
said
ill
certainly
seek
it
out
in
the
future
run
dont
walk
to
get
this
beer
drink
i
like
this
beer
nonetheless
i
could
only
do
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
i
will
be
buying
some
more
of
this
in
the
future
very
high
abv
not
to
high
and
its
readily
available
might
be
one
of
the
most
sessionable
rye
beers
ive
had
tastes
great
and
not
too
expensive
d
very
good
but
not
incredible
i
will
reach
for
it
again
but
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
great
ipa
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
several
of
these
definitely
among
my
favorites
very
drinkable
my
favorite
from
founders
so
far
great
brew
d
drinking
the
bottle
is
clearly
not
an
issue
but
not
sure
i
would
want
to
line
a
bunch
of
these
up
in
a
row
for
one
sitting
on
the
heavy
side
of
body
for
a
pale
ale
with
a
creamy
lowmid
carb
bite
d
a
really
great
brew
that
shows
a
bit
of
a
classic
of
all
ingredients
used
a
nice
use
of
rye
while
still
having
a
nice
hop
presence
good
classic
founders
taste
that
runs
through
all
brews
just
maybe
for
a
food
that
doesnt
leave
me
so
comatose
as
tonights
time
to
find
some
coffee
overallnotes
like
their
centennial
ipa
founders
has
a
beer
thats
just
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
here
this
one
may
even
be
better
ive
never
had
a
rye
beer
but
im
downloading
the
style
to
my
memory
banks
for
future
purchases
really
wellrounded
brew
that
id
say
you
should
try
if
you
havent
already
d
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
summer
day
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
slides
down
the
gullet
the
abv
leaves
you
wanting
more
opens
seriously
bitter
with
a
blast
of
citrus
hops
and
suggestions
of
grapefruit
pith
moves
into
a
deftly
balanced
rich
caramel
malt
middle
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
expressive
carbonation
rye
character
begins
to
emerge
finishes
grainy
with
a
scratch
of
spiced
rye
on
the
back
of
the
throat
big
juicy
red
a
bit
thin
and
burny
but
close
to
a
classic
d
with
the
medium
body
and
only
subtle
bitterness
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
ease
into
ipas
for
a
new
advocate
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
and
the
sweetness
will
keep
those
new
guys
interested
i
do
not
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
throughout
the
night
because
the
flavor
is
rather
intense
but
this
does
not
hurt
the
overall
rating
of
the
beer
this
make
me
want
to
do
the
humpty
hump
can
i
have
a
case
delivered
to
my
doorstep
ever
other
week
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
beer
i
put
several
of
these
away
after
the
first
one
nicely
done
beer
d
great
tasting
brew
that
stands
out
because
of
its
unique
style
try
one
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
the
bitterness
was
delicate
and
fitting
this
beer
would
be
very
special
during
the
spring
of
the
year
easily
drinkable
at
6
6
abv
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
easily
the
head
stayed
around
for
the
entire
beer
amazing
md
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
even
though
its
a
rye
beer
the
spiciness
was
a
little
surprising
d
the
hop
assualt
seems
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
for
a
pale
ale
and
there
is
a
lack
of
malty
goodness
to
back
it
up
this
lack
of
balance
while
dilicous
hurts
drinkability
i
honestly
liked
this
beer
more
than
the
grade
reflects
overall
a
decent
brew
but
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
expectations
i
had
following
my
experiences
with
their
good
scotch
ale
and
fantastic
porter
d
robust
all
the
way
around
the
color
the
malts
the
hops
actually
leans
on
the
hop
angle
of
the
p
a
part
of
the
name
a
tad
more
than
the
rye
but
the
rye
does
still
come
through
a
bit
too
dark
to
really
be
called
a
pale
verging
toward
an
amber
nothing
wrong
with
any
of
this
it
is
one
nice
and
tasty
drinker
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
a
goodly
bit
of
malt
and
peppery
rye
almost
overshadowing
the
citrus
hops
the
taste
reflects
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
before
the
peppery
and
citrus
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
a
rye
not
overpoweringly
heavy
so
a
very
good
drinkable
rye
p
a
d
a
good
easy
drinker
kinda
impressed
me
pours
a
deep
amber
red
color
with
a
thick
soapy
offwhite
head
has
an
aroma
of
grapefruit
caramel
and
rye
with
hints
of
pint
has
a
dipa
feel
to
it
but
with
the
rye
flavor
on
the
aftertaste
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
hop
hit
as
well
not
a
fan
of
rye
pale
ales
but
this
one
is
very
good
not
a
surprise
coming
from
founders
d
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
about
an
hour
after
dinner
very
filling
but
one
of
my
favorites
4
0
d
solid
beer
but
something
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
in
order
to
have
a
really
enjoyable
experience
that
said
i
might
have
given
this
a
much
higher
score
on
another
day
but
its
hard
to
say
for
sure
still
this
is
good
enough
anytime
very
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
drinkability
very
good
this
being
not
an
overly
complex
beer
and
so
balanced
you
can
hardly
notice
that
it
has
6
8
alcohol
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
reds
rye
is
one
of
the
few
brews
that
ill
go
for
virtually
every
time
i
see
it
available
a
fantastic
beer
with
all
due
respect
to
terrapin
and
bear
republic
this
one
is
the
benchmark
for
worldclass
rye
pale
ales
pretty
good
ipa
all
around
not
too
aggressively
bitter
but
it
doesnt
lack
punch
heavy
on
the
pine
and
pretty
clean
taste
is
really
rye
forward
its
got
that
bitter
rye
bite
thats
a
bit
almost
minty
theres
a
pretty
solid
bitterness
from
the
hops
as
well
that
rounds
it
out
nicely
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
the
word
balance
keeps
coming
up
as
i
describe
each
facet
of
this
wonderful
rye
brew
it
seems
that
a
lot
of
care
was
taken
by
the
brewers
to
balance
each
aspect
of
the
drinking
experience
judged
as
an
ipa
its
fairly
mellow
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
its
not
a
fullflavored
brew
im
sure
that
i
could
put
a
couple
of
these
away
without
much
effort
but
the
70
ibus
combined
with
the
6
6
abv
knock
down
the
drinkability
a
smidge
however
reds
rye
is
still
well
worth
seeking
out
and
highly
recommended
another
great
offering
from
one
of
the
finest
breweries
out
there
d
very
excellent
brew
had
great
flavor
and
complexity
that
was
great
the
flavors
mix
well
with
the
high
carbonation
to
give
this
brew
a
nice
bittersweet
character
only
set
back
would
be
that
this
brew
is
more
an
ipa
then
a
rye
but
im
a
fan
of
ipas
and
of
founders
so
not
true
points
lost
the
beer
has
a
nice
spicy
rye
character
which
interacts
very
well
with
the
hops
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
caramel
up
front
while
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
planty
the
beer
coats
your
mouth
but
is
also
dry
it
is
quite
a
treat
dont
pass
on
this
uniquely
crafted
brew
complex
but
yet
so
original
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
the
head
is
frothy
and
very
thick
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
bread
the
taste
is
somewhat
creamy
there
is
an
earthy
malt
spicy
flavor
to
the
beer
the
rye
plays
a
good
part
with
this
being
amber
with
an
orange
tint
and
the
earthy
spicy
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
as
far
as
drinkability
yeah
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
d
founders
got
it
right
with
this
mixture
a
lot
of
taste
but
you
can
easily
down
13
of
these
to
relax
a
beer
i
will
look
foward
to
having
many
times
in
the
future
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
classic
and
another
home
run
from
founders
its
about
tied
with
cane
and
ebel
for
the
title
of
best
rye
beer
in
my
book
great
brew
its
medium
on
the
palate
with
perfect
carbonation
its
hard
to
drink
only
one
reds
rye
pale
ale
and
anything
that
follows
other
than
another
reds
has
a
tendency
to
be
disappointing
the
taste
is
very
bitter
with
a
complex
of
malt
flavors
the
rye
is
very
nice
but
the
bitterness
is
somewhat
harsh
and
very
forward
it
limited
my
interest
in
finishing
this
beer
and
interfered
with
the
otherwise
nice
complexity
of
the
malts
and
hop
flavors
deep
amber
body
with
a
solid
12
inch
of
light
tan
head
and
nice
retention
really
nice
looking
beer
lots
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
maybe
a
hint
of
rye
as
well
i
get
alot
of
hops
upfront
in
the
taste
which
gets
balanced
out
quickly
with
a
nice
dose
of
malt
and
spicy
rye
and
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
decent
carbonation
i
did
get
a
bit
more
heat
than
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
of
this
abv
percentage
d
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
but
i
would
call
it
an
ipa
instead
of
rye
beer
this
is
one
hell
of
a
good
beer
perfect
ipa
character
in
my
opinion
by
offering
a
crisp
hoppy
flavor
with
terrific
aroma
love
the
red
color
and
slightly
tan
head
i
think
the
packaging
on
this
beer
should
be
changed
because
ive
seen
this
before
in
the
store
and
have
just
walked
on
by
man
am
i
glad
i
finally
stopped
and
grabbed
a
sixer
kudos
to
founders
for
putting
together
a
beer
that
follows
the
west
coast
example
of
hoppiness
and
abv
while
using
unique
ingredients
over
your
run
of
the
mill
ipa
i
cant
see
how
anyone
wouldnt
like
this
beer
this
poured
a
very
nice
deep
red
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
there
were
also
quite
a
few
carbonation
bubbles
to
look
at
the
smell
was
that
of
rye
and
breadiness
there
were
also
notes
of
cirtus
grapefruit
and
some
malty
toastiness
this
beer
was
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
i
thought
this
was
a
nicely
balanced
beer
the
taste
also
included
some
citrus
nice
amount
of
rye
and
some
lemon
zest
the
mouthfeel
was
good
it
coated
the
mouth
nicely
and
had
a
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
as
well
i
think
i
could
keep
drinking
these
all
night
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
fine
founders
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
cheers
the
taste
had
a
delicious
hoppiness
that
was
just
bitter
enough
without
being
too
bitter
a
nice
hint
of
rye
was
backed
up
by
the
flavors
of
a
good
red
ale
it
made
me
think
of
a
higherend
killians
with
more
hoppy
flavor
im
not
sure
if
thats
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
maybe
my
palate
was
just
shot
the
creamy
and
full
mouthfeel
went
down
pleasantly
and
was
very
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
drinkability
a
great
apa
with
solid
rye
character
nice
contrast
from
the
traditional
apa
must
try
d
a
great
rye
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
always
would
reach
for
this
one
most
tend
to
be
overdone
in
the
rye
smell
and
flavor
department
but
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
would
not
expect
anything
less
from
founders
dcould
have
10
the
first
thing
you
taste
is
fruity
hops
the
aftertaste
comes
on
slowly
and
doesnt
have
much
bitter
kick
the
rye
is
noticeable
here
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
so
it
has
some
volume
in
the
mouth
a
very
nice
brew
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
carbonation
decidedly
on
the
low
side
still
pretty
drinkable
in
my
book
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
was
strikingly
similar
to
flying
dogs
raging
bitch
im
not
convinced
they
arent
the
same
beer
actually
that
being
said
this
one
is
a
bit
more
malty
while
the
bitch
has
a
bit
more
hop
to
it
o
very
good
selection
from
a
great
brewery
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
throw
a
few
back
cant
wait
ti
get
more
d
id
order
another
pint
but
this
bottle
seems
past
despite
being
only
2
months
old
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
rusty
redish
brown
color
it
smells
of
aroma
hops
i
almost
wanna
say
they
used
a
bittering
hop
such
as
chinook
as
the
aroma
hop
lots
of
nasty
bitter
hops
i
love
it
i
smell
a
mild
tea
aroma
to
the
taste
is
of
nasty
bittering
hops
if
you
are
a
hop
head
like
me
you
will
love
it
if
you
are
not
i
assure
you
this
beer
is
not
for
you
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
not
so
much
as
it
is
6
8
abvthis
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
get
it
about
once
a
month
from
columbus
ga
because
they
do
not
offer
this
beer
in
my
area
drinkabilty
great
beer
one
of
the
best
ryes
out
there
not
quite
the
hop
rye
killer
that
hoprod
is
but
very
nice
and
smooth
i
really
like
how
the
hops
and
rye
work
with
eachother
to
create
this
great
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
drinkability
hides
the
abv
well
and
is
definitely
a
beer
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
very
balanced
with
a
complex
flavoraroma
combo
this
beer
deserves
the
high
marks
it
receives
founders
is
as
good
as
any
brewery
in
america
they
certainly
know
how
to
do
big
limited
release
beers
but
their
everday
bread
and
butter
offerings
are
the
real
treasures
d
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
rye
beer
now
this
stuff
is
awesome
tastes
great
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
try
to
drink
all
night
worth
getting
your
hands
on
to
try
bottle
pours
a
very
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
2
finger
head
taht
slowly
settles
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
as
it
goes
down
fruity
floral
hop
aroma
fills
my
noise
as
i
take
my
first
sniff
an
interesting
first
taste
as
the
rye
used
gives
a
different
type
of
taste
compared
to
the
usual
malt
profile
nice
an
smooth
subtle
sweetness
then
gives
way
to
a
nice
hop
bite
that
lingers
some
citrus
rind
type
bitterness
along
with
fruit
and
floral
pretty
tasty
nicely
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
minimal
alcohol
notes
d
solid
beer
here
i
would
drink
this
one
again
im
convinced
that
founders
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
d
this
is
an
excellent
brew
it
has
nice
rye
character
and
has
an
interesting
hop
profile
which
pairs
nice
with
the
rye
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
light
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
and
complex
enough
to
make
each
sip
very
interesting
overall
a
quality
beer
from
founders
get
you
some
reds
ryepa
asap
i
could
easily
make
this
a
goto
beer
and
a
session
beer
if
it
was
just
slightly
more
affordable
instead
i
milk
every
bottle
like
its
going
extinct
but
im
sure
ill
come
back
to
this
one
whenever
i
can
very
nice
d
this
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
see
it
on
tap
i
can
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
founders
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
with
this
beer
fantastic
beer
that
is
a
easy
drinker
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
rye
with
some
orange
citrus
notes
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
rye
in
it
the
flavor
is
rye
with
a
lot
of
hop
character
i
get
some
pine
orange
citrus
and
pineapple
as
well
as
some
toffee
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
overall
excellent
beer
overall
another
great
offering
by
founders
i
would
highly
recommend
this
highly
drinkable
for
this
hophead
and
at
6
8
not
mindcloundingly
strong
to
the
point
that
youre
one
and
done
my
only
regret
is
that
i
bought
this
as
a
singleton
instead
of
the
whole
sixpack
medium
brown
cloudy
even
cream
head
lots
of
lacing
smells
nice
and
hoppy
citrus
and
grapefruit
and
mango
and
pineapple
resinous
hop
flavor
with
a
medium
malt
balance
the
rye
comes
through
subtly
but
pleasant
nice
lingering
bitterness
and
hoppy
aftertaste
great
pale
ale
overall
rye
balances
the
hop
bitterness
really
nicely
side
note
my
bottle
said
6
6
abv
vs
the
6
8
listed
on
this
site
d
goes
down
pretty
well
but
its
really
heavy
a
meal
in
itself
i
thought
i
wouldnt
have
a
beer
this
week
that
would
rate
above
a
b
but
this
one
is
really
good
i
might
be
a
bit
partial
seeing
this
beer
comes
from
my
hometown
i
did
not
know
it
until
i
tasted
it
and
got
curious
about
where
it
was
brewed
but
that
withstanding
this
is
a
good
unique
beer
this
is
about
to
be
my
favorite
style
this
brew
gave
me
about
a
one
finger
head
of
light
brown
suds
and
finally
faded
after
about
two
minutes
the
color
is
a
rich
dark
amberred
rating
a
26
on
the
srm
chart
the
smell
of
apple
grapefruit
currant
rye
caramel
sweet
malt
and
raspberry
are
the
strongest
smells
with
a
hint
of
clover
this
is
a
wonderful
flavor
far
from
your
run
of
the
mill
brew
this
beer
has
the
flavor
of
grapefruit
berries
apple
malt
and
finishes
with
a
great
bitter
flavor
of
hops
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
better
i
like
it
i
am
so
glad
i
have
access
to
this
in
the
south
feels
like
cream
in
my
mouth
nice
tingle
and
buzz
as
it
passes
over
my
tongue
and
down
my
throat
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
but
it
sure
wont
be
my
last
and
next
time
it
will
be
in
bigger
quantities
for
sure
i
will
share
this
with
my
friends
i
am
sure
some
will
not
like
it
as
much
as
i
but
that
is
why
we
are
all
individuals
da
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
but
the
drying
qualities
and
lack
of
mildly
chewier
mouthfeel
hurt
my
enjoyment
of
this
one
d
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
it
tastes
like
im
sucking
on
bitter
hops
that
have
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
not
for
me
goes
down
like
swimming
in
your
esophagus
although
the
6
6
abv
maybe
is
a
bit
low
d
pretty
drinkable
the
rye
gives
it
a
spicy
tinge
but
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
lingering
bitterness
a
solid
beer
worth
trying
but
i
dont
see
how
it
is
in
the
top
100
cheers
this
is
great
for
anyone
i
would
recommend
this
to
my
friends
who
are
just
getting
into
craft
beer
and
my
ba
friends
alike
this
is
a
versatile
brew
overall
no
need
for
a
long
review
here
you
get
what
you
hope
for
and
expect
this
is
excellent
founders
bells
great
lakes
if
youre
listening
we
want
you
in
colorado
surprisingly
good
i
really
liked
it
immensely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
juicy
chewy
and
fluffy
all
at
once
d
even
if
this
was
just
marked
as
an
ipa
id
find
the
hops
too
intense
for
my
personal
tastes
but
if
thats
your
style
then
you
might
like
it
just
dont
expect
any
rye
finally
tried
my
first
founders
and
it
aint
no
flounder
beer
came
in
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
deep
translucent
unfiltered
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
the
beer
didnt
quite
smack
me
with
the
smell
of
fresh
hops
i
was
suspecting
when
i
cracked
it
and
i
think
this
beer
is
fairly
fresh
and
i
can
smell
a
sweet
malty
backbone
the
taste
is
of
grapefruity
hops
you
can
tell
it
was
dry
hopped
has
that
extradeep
pungent
layer
of
hops
in
there
you
get
from
the
process
that
extra
pucker
at
the
end
in
the
aftertaste
but
i
dont
pick
up
much
rye
in
there
yet
there
is
a
maltiness
to
round
out
the
hoppiness
going
on
here
the
label
mentions
rye
and
belgium
malts
but
honestly
and
it
could
all
be
due
to
a
slight
lack
of
freshness
please
start
date
stamping
these
i
am
a
little
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
complexity
in
the
taste
of
this
brew
i
love
amarillo
hops
too
i
think
it
was
fresh
cause
i
bought
it
from
a
decent
store
with
good
turnaround
etc
i
know
what
hoppy
beers
taste
like
when
they
fade
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
found
pretty
darn
drinkable
despite
my
complaints
but
where
is
the
rye
hell
even
always
watery
goose
island
mild
winter
has
way
more
rye
than
this
oh
wait
i
taste
it
hmm
or
did
i
and
those
belgian
malts
really
overall
this
is
fantastic
session
beer
that
balances
sweet
malts
bitter
hops
and
a
dry
characteristic
very
nice
d
im
a
huge
ipa
fan
and
a
pretty
big
fan
of
rye
so
i
was
expecting
great
things
from
this
beer
and
i
wasnt
let
down
the
rye
was
a
little
outshined
by
the
hops
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
id
have
again
if
it
was
local
overall
i
am
impressed
this
is
only
my
second
time
trying
the
beer
but
i
will
be
returning
soon
i
expected
founders
to
bring
a
top
pabut
gimme
a
sierra
a
mirror
ponda
burning
riveror
better
yet
a
yakima
twilight
overall
an
excellent
and
supremely
well
balance
brew
definitely
recommended
not
the
most
drinkable
but
pretty
good
for
the
sweetness
d
very
drinkable
very
surprising
beer
really
loved
it
and
would
have
it
again
d
this
is
a
good
beer
this
is
my
first
for
this
style
of
beer
and
looking
forward
in
trying
some
more
on
tap
at
trappeze
in
athens
poured
into
a
pint
glass
off
white
fluffy
head
nice
retention
amber
body
aroma
is
grapefruity
orange
hoppiness
and
some
mild
malt
sweetness
smooth
tasting
nice
hop
bite
caramel
notes
on
the
malt
and
juicy
fruit
salad
goodness
lovely
d
as
it
warms
the
flavors
get
more
intense
and
spicier
and
for
me
one
or
two
is
enough
because
it
becomes
a
little
overwhelming
still
a
great
beer
but
not
exactly
sessionable
great
appearance
the
headtobeer
contrast
is
quite
beautiful
with
nice
lacing
first
thing
you
smell
is
grapefruit
and
slightly
burnt
caramel
to
me
the
taste
is
inline
with
the
aroma
very
citrusy
fruity
and
crisp
with
that
backing
of
malt
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
hit
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
top
of
your
mouth
as
it
goes
down
smell
contains
citrus
notes
including
grapefruit
candies
such
as
caramel
and
some
rye
as
well
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
some
hops
malt
a
well
balanced
sweetness
with
a
very
clean
aftertaste
it
is
a
mediumbodied
brew
with
just
the
right
carbonation
reds
rye
has
very
good
drinkability
i
wish
that
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
it
the
next
time
i
am
in
a
state
that
gets
distribution
of
founders
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
bountiful
lace
the
aroma
is
a
tropical
fruit
melange
and
some
of
that
resiny
taste
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
suit
to
an
extent
youve
got
your
tropical
fruit
blend
but
also
some
sweet
marmalade
like
tones
the
bitterness
is
sharp
yet
clean
and
theres
a
dulled
spiciness
present
that
is
a
contribution
from
the
rye
rather
than
alcohol
i
believe
d
a
pretty
good
rye
beer
lots
of
hops
in
the
nose
but
more
malts
in
the
taste
would
have
again
picked
this
up
at
saveon
a
great
beer
store
in
mentor
ohio
clear
copper
pour
with
quickly
fading
head
and
decent
lacing
nice
big
earthy
herbal
nose
with
hints
of
toffee
caramel
citrus
and
rye
the
taste
is
very
unique
and
has
a
lot
going
on
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
hits
you
first
but
is
nicely
offset
by
a
solid
roasty
caramel
malt
backbone
hints
of
tea
pine
grass
resin
toffee
and
of
course
rye
the
rye
really
comes
to
the
forefront
as
it
warms
great
chewy
and
resiny
mouthfeel
makes
this
quite
drinkable
for
me
the
spicy
rye
bitterness
is
there
from
start
to
finish
only
my
second
experience
with
founders
but
theyre
two
for
two
so
far
may
have
just
taken
over
first
place
with
me
for
rye
pas
another
thanks
to
irishkyle21
for
sending
this
one
my
way
i
regret
giving
the
second
bottle
to
a
friend
before
tasting
it
i
may
have
been
selfish
had
id
known
how
much
i
wouldve
enjoyed
thats
ok
though
my
mother
always
told
me
to
share
the
love
reds
rye
pa
is
a
great
beer
it
pours
into
the
glass
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
and
a
rich
red
color
it
is
a
good
balance
of
serious
hops
and
gentle
malt
to
make
for
a
full
and
complete
smooth
yet
hoppy
flavor
it
comes
it
at
6
6
abv
and
70
ibus
according
to
the
brewery
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
just
a
bit
to
bitter
for
more
than
2
or
3
but
great
tasting
done
very
well
i
had
this
on
cask
at
george
keeleys
on
manhattans
upper
west
side
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cask
versions
but
i
always
try
them
and
this
was
better
than
most
surprisingly
good
carbonation
nice
flavor
not
too
warm
if
you
see
it
get
it
pours
a
copper
brown
color
with
good
off
white
frothy
head
good
lacing
and
lively
carbonation
sweet
bread
caramel
like
smell
taste
was
much
the
same
with
some
bitter
grass
hints
thin
slick
texture
and
a
light
body
pretty
harsh
bitter
bread
like
finish
with
an
average
flavor
duration
good
brew
but
nothing
special
the
rye
in
this
for
my
taste
takes
just
a
little
bit
away
from
the
drinkability
as
compared
to
some
of
the
ipas
that
i
could
drink
for
days
without
hesitation
as
it
stands
rye
pa
is
hella
drinkable
and
worth
revisiting
again
and
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
boy
did
it
look
beautiful
gorgeous
copper
in
color
with
some
brightness
and
a
nice
head
smelled
like
heaven
tons
of
hops
in
the
nose
pine
grapefruit
caramel
rye
awesome
tasted
pretty
darn
amazing
as
wella
beer
crafted
for
me
it
seems
as
i
love
rye
beers
and
all
their
spiciness
and
yet
i
crave
the
hop
assault
of
the
dipa
this
was
both
and
yet
strangely
drinkable
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
them
all
night
but
id
like
to
have
two
or
three
a
night
pretty
much
every
night
of
the
week
hops
hops
hops
and
rye
obviously
with
just
enough
countering
malt
character
to
go
down
real
smooth
nice
carbonation
give
me
more
love
this
one
even
more
than
the
centennial
and
you
cant
compare
it
at
all
to
the
breakfast
stout
the
other
founders
ive
tried
but
everything
ive
had
from
them
is
phenomenal
tastes
a
lot
like
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
which
is
a
great
thing
and
each
are
one
of
my
favorite
brews
wish
there
were
more
ryepas
out
there
as
good
as
these
ones
awesome
stuff
thoughts
im
pretty
sure
i
have
never
had
a
bad
or
even
average
beer
from
founders
i
might
be
byased
on
this
review
everytime
i
have
a
founders
beer
i
think
i
already
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
probably
not
the
best
thing
but
we
they
rock
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
for
sure
maybe
the
best
rye
beer
ive
had
pours
a
bright
reddish
copper
with
a
nice
dense
offwhite
head
strong
citruspine
hop
aroma
with
a
healthy
touch
of
rye
and
caramel
malt
flavor
has
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
biscuit
and
caramel
maltiness
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
a
bit
floral
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
kind
of
tastes
like
a
heavily
american
hopped
esb
medium
to
full
body
that
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
to
it
d
for
a
year
round
offering
this
is
an
excellent
beer
founders
does
the
same
thing
with
their
porter
and
ipa
it
perfectly
melds
big
bold
hops
with
a
nice
malt
bill
for
excellent
drinkability
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
it
will
be
part
of
my
regular
purchase
rotation
d
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
with
an
amped
up
amount
of
rye
another
solid
year
round
beer
from
founders
i
like
they
date
their
bottles
i
just
with
they
would
make
it
a
little
easier
to
find
and
read
oh
well
freshness
usually
isnt
an
issue
with
them
around
here
anyways
i
had
this
on
tap
into
a
tulip
at
the
map
room
a
dark
amber
pour
nothing
of
note
the
aroma
is
strong
lots
of
hop
present
with
a
light
malt
caramel
backbone
a
rye
accent
finish
the
taste
is
mostly
hoppy
but
in
a
good
way
does
not
let
the
rye
dominate
or
really
present
hoppy
throughout
really
nice
feel
bitter
easy
to
drink
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
consistent
half
inch
offwhite
head
composed
of
compressed
tiny
bubbles
below
the
surface
of
the
cap
head
exhibits
good
retention
with
thick
swaths
and
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
sweet
citrus
notes
on
a
toasted
malt
backbone
with
the
merest
suggestion
of
caramel
taste
is
somewhat
consistent
with
nose
however
sweetness
is
somewhat
muted
and
an
even
bitterness
comes
out
malt
profile
is
a
little
more
flat
and
earthy
the
rye
definitely
makes
itself
known
here
and
finishes
with
a
light
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
closer
to
the
lighter
side
of
the
spectrum
with
a
lively
semisparkling
background
carbonation
a
solid
beer
with
a
great
balance
between
malty
and
hoppy
sweet
and
bitter
loads
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
pine
citrus
caramel
malts
and
once
again
more
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
treat
d
delicious
flavor
great
body
but
the
higher
abv
limits
sessionability
still
this
is
easily
the
best
rye
beer
ive
ever
had
and
would
rank
highly
on
the
ipa
scale
if
it
were
so
classified
fantastic
job
by
founders
on
this
one
d
very
drinkable
d
this
is
an
awesome
brew
excellent
use
of
hops
and
rye
i
would
like
to
pair
this
up
with
a
bunch
of
different
stuff
to
see
how
it
works
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
great
i
really
love
this
beer
this
is
one
of
those
can
drink
any
time
beers
this
is
one
of
a
few
that
is
on
my
regular
purchase
list
great
beer
overall
done
of
the
best
ryeinspired
beers
in
the
world
founders
never
misses
when
it
comes
to
hops
and
this
is
no
different
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
is
unique
and
obviously
worth
trying
unfortunately
this
beer
degrades
quickly
and
the
dropoff
is
big
so
drink
this
asap
because
it
becomes
a
different
beer
after
a
few
short
months
easily
one
of
the
best
ryes
ive
had
body
is
just
right
a
medium
character
that
is
not
too
thick
or
syrupy
the
rye
provides
a
bit
of
a
lightening
effect
making
it
almost
silky
an
excellent
highlyhopped
rye
beer
dthis
beer
is
delicious
a
great
blend
of
hops
and
malt
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
night
notes
founders
never
disappoints
me
ever
this
is
no
exception
d
very
impressed
with
this
beer
flavorful
and
not
too
heavy
makes
me
want
more
overall
a
splendid
beer
has
this
many
times
on
tap
and
always
loved
it
this
is
my
first
bottle
but
certainly
not
my
last
danother
very
drinkable
beer
from
founders
one
which
is
very
different
when
it
is
allowed
to
warm
a
bit
also
i
might
add
a
hell
of
a
value
i
expected
this
to
be
offered
in
a
4
pack
for
the
price
of
the
6
pack
that
it
comes
in
mouthfeel
is
not
as
luscious
as
id
like
but
really
the
taste
makes
this
really
stellar
and
drinkable
highly
at
6
6
session
with
care
this
would
go
well
with
casual
but
elegant
pub
fare
good
drinkability
well
balanced
nice
refreshing
and
very
satisfying
all
in
all
this
beer
is
pretty
much
a
standard
rye
beer
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
it
does
well
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
have
nothing
really
negative
to
say
about
it
give
it
a
try
only
you
can
decide
for
yourself
shrug
d
another
great
beer
from
founders
easy
to
drink
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
reds
rye
is
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
i
have
tasted
its
also
a
nicely
balanced
ipa
the
rye
is
present
but
never
overwhelming
the
caramel
malt
and
citrusy
hops
strike
a
nice
balance
the
alcohol
never
gets
in
the
way
the
drying
hop
qualities
make
this
more
drinkable
than
it
should
be
i
tip
my
hat
to
founders
for
creating
a
tasty
world
class
quaff
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
fulltime
offerings
that
ive
ever
had
from
any
brewery
it
strikes
the
perfect
balance
for
a
rye
pa
for
me
there
is
a
copious
amount
of
citrus
hop
flavor
nice
barley
and
rye
malt
and
yeasty
breadyness
available
to
my
mouth
simply
put
this
is
a
great
beer
dark
coppery
red
color
with
a
chucky
thick
head
that
stuck
all
over
the
glass
smell
was
citrus
reminded
me
a
strong
grapefruit
similar
hoppy
taste
except
with
a
surprisingly
prominent
maltyness
and
of
course
the
rye
flavor
my
first
rye
ipa
but
my
impression
is
that
this
beer
was
particularly
well
balanced
and
delicious
d
a
good
beer
for
a
rye
beer
which
im
not
a
fan
of
it
tasted
ok
i
would
pick
a
ipa
or
pa
which
has
a
little
more
flavor
to
it
still
though
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
this
in
the
mouth
feel
it
is
very
prickly
with
carbonation
a
bit
powdery
from
the
excess
yeast
left
over
and
there
is
a
mild
burn
in
the
end
founders
red
rye
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
went
away
rather
quickly
it
had
a
nice
hoppymalty
smell
to
it
the
taste
was
overall
fantastic
it
had
a
very
nice
combition
of
malts
and
hops
and
maybe
a
pine
flavor
as
well
it
had
a
very
strong
taste
that
lasted
much
after
you
finished
this
beer
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
too
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
a
fantastic
brewer
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
notes
this
is
good
very
balanced
with
a
good
hoppy
taste
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
it
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
about
the
same
as
hot
rod
rye
from
bear
republic
but
it
was
defiantly
more
hoppy
which
i
loved
more
great
beer
dvery
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
nothing
more
just
ok
ive
tried
some
of
this
style
before
and
thought
others
were
better
i
had
high
hopes
but
was
left
disappointed
not
worth
your
time
good
to
try
once
if
you
have
access
but
thats
all
this
is
a
huge
beer
really
liked
the
appearance
of
the
copper
color
and
one
finger
tan
head
smell
was
of
hops
grapefruit
a
bit
of
pine
and
other
deliciousness
taste
was
the
same
i
loved
the
hops
and
rye
playing
together
nicely
mouthfeel
was
medium
as
was
the
drinkability
this
was
big
and
bad
in
a
good
way
most
founders
beers
are
so
good
that
they
make
you
want
to
drink
more
this
is
no
exception
highly
recommended
di
have
to
admit
that
i
dig
the
rye
a
good
dealso
i
might
be
biasedbut
i
consider
this
a
highly
sessionable
beer
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
come
across
one
of
those
beers
that
i
just
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
perfect
to
session
with
basically
any
time
of
year
so
crispy
and
delicious
damn
near
perfect
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
bottled
on
42010
haha
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
pours
a
reddishcopper
with
high
carbonation
and
a
nice
sticky
light
tan
head
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
from
the
amarillo
hops
with
a
good
mix
of
caramel
malts
lots
of
doughy
rye
malts
ride
the
palate
with
a
nice
spicyness
at
the
end
very
full
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
chewy
texture
this
is
a
very
good
overall
beer
that
i
will
have
to
get
more
of
next
time
poured
this
into
my
tulip
pours
a
nice
ruby
color
with
patches
of
visible
carbonation
that
look
great
a
rocky
off
white
head
sits
atop
this
beer
at
about
two
inches
huge
sticky
lacing
all
along
the
nose
is
full
of
citrus
with
a
the
hint
of
rye
the
frontrunner
on
this
is
a
big
sweet
pink
grapefruit
smell
great
citrus
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hop
bittering
for
the
finish
a
little
bit
spicy
though
i
immagine
that
is
due
to
the
rye
overall
though
this
taste
great
a
really
nice
mouth
feel
to
this
one
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
not
bad
to
drink
but
i
think
it
is
a
bit
spicy
so
that
brings
it
down
for
me
a
bit
whos
red
probably
some
filthy
commie
this
beer
pours
a
clear
rubyamber
topped
by
nearly
two
fingers
of
ecru
froth
the
nose
comprises
pine
needles
tangelos
creamy
caramel
and
a
touch
of
peppery
rye
the
taste
kicks
up
the
rye
a
great
deal
though
it
is
still
not
allowed
to
take
any
position
of
preeminence
instead
it
shares
the
spotlight
in
a
vigorous
tango
with
hop
elements
that
themselves
gracefully
combine
the
talents
of
pine
and
ruby
red
grapefruit
its
quite
a
dance
particularly
set
against
the
backdrop
of
sweet
caramel
the
body
is
a
fluffy
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
very
creamy
feel
this
beer
begs
to
be
continually
consumed
and
returned
to
thankfully
ive
got
the
rest
of
this
growler
to
help
me
with
that
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
good
beer
with
rich
and
flavorful
flavor
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
complex
but
simple
well
done
founders
d
i
dont
know
if
i
am
still
into
session
drinking
ipas
but
if
i
were
this
would
be
the
one
i
start
with
the
balance
makes
it
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
medium
smooth
midlevel
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
drinkability
is
very
good
tastes
so
great
and
makes
me
ilfing
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
just
not
that
outstanding
in
my
opinion
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
particularly
seek
it
out
when
there
are
so
many
other
good
pale
ales
and
ipas
out
there
tops
out
as
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
dark
chocalate
brown
with
a
small
head
smells
of
bourbon
a
dash
of
malt
chocalaty
for
sure
making
me
very
hoppy
smooth
rich
and
goes
down
fast
ild
write
a
review
about
its
taste
but
all
the
ground
has
been
covered
on
this
one
outstanding
i
need
not
say
more
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
deep
red
brown
color
with
almost
crystal
clarity
great
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
like
a
spicy
ipa
with
some
nice
caramel
malt
undertones
and
spicy
piney
hops
great
floral
aroma
as
well
taste
is
on
point
with
typical
founders
hops
nice
spicy
character
would
pair
well
with
bbq
ribs
and
burgers
rustic
rye
component
gives
a
nice
earthy
undertone
nice
carbonation
and
coats
the
palate
well
with
a
great
aftertaste
that
lingers
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
as
its
not
only
delicious
but
well
made
and
enjoyable
very
smooth
interesting
brew
i
think
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
this
is
my
first
rye
beer
and
i
am
very
impressed
drinks
really
well
a
bit
of
alcohol
can
be
detected
but
its
overshadowed
by
the
plethora
of
flavors
going
on
here
not
as
hopforward
as
the
70
ibu
designation
would
imply
but
still
plenty
hoppy
a
good
brew
and
one
that
will
find
its
way
into
my
glass
when
im
in
the
mood
pours
a
pretty
amber
brown
color
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
leaving
a
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
with
grapefruit
and
pine
standing
out
there
is
a
touch
of
pepper
and
candied
fruit
the
taste
is
of
a
solid
bready
malt
with
some
light
caramel
notes
this
is
followed
by
a
grapefruit
forward
hop
profile
which
also
has
notes
of
pepper
and
candied
tropical
fruit
there
is
some
nice
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
everything
comes
together
for
a
nice
spicy
profile
reds
rye
is
moderate
to
full
bodied
with
tingly
carbonation
finishes
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
and
dry
a
hoppy
rye
brew
that
is
supported
by
bready
malt
nothing
is
over
the
top
but
there
are
some
big
flavors
very
well
made
very
drinkable
a
super
example
of
the
style
tasty
and
refreshing
definitely
one
to
keep
stocked
this
my
favorite
from
founders
a
deep
redburnt
orange
that
is
great
looking
thick
head
that
lasts
to
the
end
with
smooth
soft
lacing
smells
of
fruits
and
malt
with
mild
hops
taste
is
awesome
and
not
overly
hopped
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
extremely
well
balanced
flavor
overall
some
grassy
tones
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
amazing
in
fact
i
gotta
go
get
me
another
out
of
the
fridge
one
of
the
best
from
founders
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
one
i
will
be
picking
up
again
in
the
near
future
it
has
a
mildness
that
most
ipas
lack
which
is
why
i
think
the
rpa
is
now
going
to
be
the
sought
after
style
of
my
up
and
coming
brews
d
very
balanced
drinkable
beer
for
those
who
like
a
bitter
dry
bee
seriously
does
founders
have
anything
on
the
shelves
thats
not
a
solid
a
d
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
goes
well
with
virtually
any
situation
the
best
balance
between
rye
and
hops
ive
ever
had
in
any
beer
wish
i
could
have
had
it
on
tap
but
unfortunately
taco
mac
blew
the
keg
and
i
had
to
get
it
in
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
doesnt
retain
particularly
well
the
aroma
has
fresh
and
juicy
hop
notes
upfront
along
with
rye
caramel
citrus
toasted
bread
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
piney
and
citrusy
hop
notes
initially
along
with
some
caramel
rye
bread
brown
sugar
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
very
tasty
and
intensely
bitter
rye
beer
but
the
fresh
flavoraroma
of
the
hops
really
help
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
crowd
md
medium
to
light
body
average
carbonation
a
little
tickle
on
the
tongue
but
that
could
be
from
the
rye
very
good
drinkability
well
balanced
and
tasty
goes
down
too
fast
overall
for
getting
a
botched
6
pack
of
two
hearted
i
ran
to
the
store
looking
for
a
hopped
up
beer
and
i
decided
on
this
i
was
gonna
go
with
the
centennial
which
is
classic
but
i
tried
this
for
the
first
time
and
i
cant
complain
i
highly
suggest
any
hophead
to
try
this
i
can
see
why
this
beer
has
such
a
high
rating
bought
it
in
a
12oz
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
great
head
on
the
beer
that
retained
all
the
way
through
creating
a
great
lacing
on
the
glass
not
an
overly
hoppy
beer
but
you
know
it
is
an
ipa
and
a
good
one
at
that
great
balance
of
the
flavors
creates
a
high
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
d
great
rye
flavor
without
sacrificing
the
traditional
ipa
balance
of
malt
and
hop
a
well
rounded
beer
that
i
will
purchase
quite
often
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
my
comments
are
meant
to
be
too
negative
its
just
that
if
this
beer
would
just
be
marketed
as
an
ipa
or
a
regular
pale
ale
i
would
give
this
beer
a
bit
of
a
higher
score
it
is
only
because
it
is
called
a
rye
beer
and
im
just
not
getting
any
rye
is
due
to
a
lower
score
like
i
said
this
is
a
great
beer
but
doesnt
give
me
what
it
tells
me
it
should
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
an
english
pint
glass
at
slightly
warmer
than
fridge
temperature
the
beer
pours
a
nice
white
head
that
falls
fairly
soon
to
a
thin
film
slight
lacing
the
beer
itself
is
dark
amber
showing
fine
suspended
particles
and
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
the
nose
is
pungent
hops
spice
and
perhaps
apple
skin
the
flavor
is
very
hops
forward
with
sour
fruit
and
a
tartness
that
can
only
come
from
rye
theres
a
definite
astringency
to
the
finish
and
a
dryness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
presents
as
a
fullbodied
beer
drinking
several
in
a
row
might
be
a
bit
of
a
challenge
in
large
part
due
to
the
astringency
of
the
finish
overall
though
a
very
good
beer
and
different
from
the
norm
awesome
beer
first
had
it
on
draft
then
saw
it
in
the
beer
shop
knew
i
had
to
get
it
this
is
the
review
of
the
bottle
i
bought
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
i
have
shared
reds
rye
with
quite
a
few
people
at
least
10
people
both
men
and
women
and
only
one
had
less
than
great
things
to
say
about
it
everyone
else
said
do
you
have
any
more
thats
90
approval
right
there
what
more
can
i
say
d
love
it
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
one
of
the
staples
in
my
fridge
one
of
the
best
from
founders
great
beer
overall
well
crafted
very
enjoyable
brew
i
can
see
why
founders
gets
so
much
hype
the
beer
was
almost
perfect
impressions
tasty
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
with
some
savory
snacks
a
ruby
amber
color
brilliant
hue
catches
the
light
and
uses
it
to
illuminate
itself
from
within
moves
like
a
light
syrup
licking
the
sides
of
the
glass
decent
head
sweet
malty
scents
with
hops
coming
over
the
top
more
subtle
on
top
of
the
sweet
smell
of
freshly
mowed
lawn
zest
of
pine
leaves
maple
syrup
an
almost
toasty
flavor
on
the
first
sip
malt
and
rye
beautiful
together
the
rye
is
crisp
and
refreshing
lingers
on
the
tongue
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
rejoice
in
this
beer
this
beer
is
an
indian
summer
in
a
bottle
it
is
a
crisp
delightful
experience
d
i
could
have
easily
polished
a
few
more
of
these
off
overall
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
too
strong
and
probably
slightly
too
complex
to
be
a
session
beer
that
being
said
it
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
rendition
of
an
increasing
segment
of
pale
ales
i
would
definitely
buy
another
six
pack
of
this
and
drink
it
with
dinner
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
i
smell
nice
sweet
malts
with
bitter
hops
following
this
one
has
a
very
fruity
taste
to
it
i
taste
apricots
as
it
also
reminds
me
of
dfhs
aprihop
this
one
has
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
with
slight
chewiness
very
refreshing
i
find
this
one
a
little
more
enjoyable
than
centennial
ipa
although
both
are
great
beers
d
more
balanced
and
drinkable
than
many
ipas
the
sweet
and
spicy
malt
character
really
shines
through
to
make
this
a
pleasant
drink
a
dark
ipa
pours
with
an
instantly
sticky
head
very
unique
color
sort
of
a
tarnished
ruby
taste
is
round
and
dense
elegant
megahoppy
front
with
a
finish
that
unfortunately
hits
a
dry
brick
wall
well
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
a
must
try
and
can
definitely
hang
with
all
of
your
favorite
american
ipas
i
definitely
dont
drink
this
beer
as
much
as
i
should
this
beer
is
special
d
an
excellent
rpa
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
one
of
my
favourite
beers
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
also
quite
sessionable
would
make
a
wonderful
session
brew
wish
i
had
more
than
2
danka
huff
d
easy
drinkability
and
nice
for
a
sunny
day
also
this
is
a
nice
switch
up
for
someone
seeking
a
bitter
beer
but
wanting
to
step
outside
the
traditional
i
p
a
d
i
am
a
big
fan
of
rpas
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
it
is
hoppy
spicy
flavorful
and
satisfying
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
and
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
in
the
taste
if
only
founders
was
available
in
ca
this
bad
boy
would
be
making
frequent
appearances
in
my
fridge
pours
a
brilliant
redambermahogany
a
1
5
inch
creamy
creamy
tan
head
forms
totally
inviting
the
initial
nose
suggests
spice
and
a
heavy
dose
of
flavoring
hops
the
body
is
medium
and
the
palate
is
immediately
hit
by
a
wallop
of
bittering
hops
that
cleanses
and
lingers
very
nicely
thick
distinct
lace
forms
nice
malt
notes
however
the
rye
is
evident
and
produces
a
very
clean
delicious
spiciness
the
carbonation
is
delicate
should
try
this
ale
with
my
next
reuben
or
pastrami
on
rye
this
ale
is
definitely
moreish
the
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
floral
hops
and
rye
malt
the
taste
had
hops
and
rye
up
front
with
a
malty
cherry
hint
in
finish
the
feel
was
light
and
dry
a
very
well
put
together
rye
beer
such
strong
tastes
that
im
not
sure
i
would
drink
more
than
1
or
2
at
a
sitting
serving
type
single
bottle
wish
i
had
got
a
couple
more
d
i
love
this
rye
the
hoppiness
fits
the
style
well
and
compliments
the
hop
profile
is
great
with
just
enough
spice
to
keep
you
coming
back
drinks
very
smoothly
for
such
a
bitter
ale
wonderful
kudos
founders
high
scores
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
so
far
and
the
hoppy
flavors
are
outstanding
founders
continues
to
amaze
me
with
their
solid
brews
creamy
awesome
mouthfeel
with
a
thick
tenacious
head
pleasing
amber
color
although
i
personally
prefer
a
much
darkerlooking
beer
smooth
subtle
hoppy
taste
colored
primarily
with
hints
of
nut
and
citrus
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
me
jumping
out
of
my
chair
definitely
worth
trying
d
great
drinkability
but
it
takes
time
to
drink
the
flavor
was
a
different
style
and
combination
that
i
have
ever
had
before
but
the
flavors
complimented
each
other
well
it
is
always
nice
to
have
a
nice
hoppy
beer
with
something
a
little
different
to
it
will
have
to
try
out
some
other
rye
beers
in
the
future
drinkability
the
hoppiness
in
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
palate
fatigue
is
not
an
issue
and
i
can
keep
on
craving
this
all
night
excellently
put
together
beer
dits
very
drinkable
i
made
the
mistake
of
bottle
drinking
a
couple
of
these
and
for
some
reason
that
amplified
the
ryenutty
characteristics
and
made
it
un
pleasant
out
of
the
glass
it
was
stellar
drinkability
is
above
average
the
taste
is
interesting
and
may
take
some
time
for
the
novice
its
hoppy
and
bitter
its
going
quite
well
with
my
corned
beef
sandwich
drinkability
goes
down
fast
and
easy
very
nice
brew
0verall
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
beer
for
the
money
id
stick
with
the
founders
centennial
drinkability
solid
taste
but
a
little
heavy
for
style
great
flavor
though
d
very
drinkable
if
you
are
into
ipas
and
you
can
definitely
feel
all
70
ibus
drinkability
is
exceptional
i
could
drink
this
by
the
keg
in
fact
this
is
the
next
16bbl
ill
be
seeking
for
the
kegerator
amazing
beer
from
founders
and
perhaps
the
best
rye
ipa
out
there
id
be
happy
to
have
local
access
to
this
rye
pale
ale
it
keeps
the
taste
buds
kicking
i
like
it
this
beer
is
also
very
drinkable
for
6
5
and
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
this
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
unique
and
delicious
creation
from
founderswhich
is
rapidly
becoming
a
favorite
brewery
of
mine
d
this
beer
is
delicious
drink
it
love
it
repeat
it
is
truly
a
hopbomb
but
a
hopbomb
to
love
more
drinkable
than
expected
d
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
not
modest
shy
or
graceful
just
straight
to
the
point
and
gets
the
job
done
this
would
be
great
paired
with
a
whole
slew
of
foods
a
king
among
ryes
picked
one
up
at
the
brewery
pours
a
very
dark
red
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
smells
very
fruity
in
a
good
way
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
it
still
tastes
good
with
a
bitter
hop
kind
of
finish
to
it
a
very
sessionable
beer
overall
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
d
i
havent
experienced
too
many
rye
beers
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
will
definitely
have
it
again
another
solid
offering
from
founders
m
d
really
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
great
sessionsummer
beer
overall
this
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
rye
added
an
interesting
note
that
i
havent
tasted
too
often
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
spring
d
not
a
bad
rye
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
either
it
held
a
lot
of
promise
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
smell
i
wont
have
a
problem
drinking
the
other
one
received
in
trade
but
likely
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
either
pours
a
brilliant
hazed
copper
with
a
perfect
fluffy
one

head
and
impressive

beer

seen
in
awhile

i
am
really
liking
how
the
flavors
are
mixing
together
a
very
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
i
would
defiantly
have
this
in
my
weekend
mix
during
the
summer
if
i
had
my
hands
on
it
to
give
me
a
break
from
all
the
dipas
id
be
drinking
would
buy
again
another
great
rye
beer
and
an
excellent
beer
from
founders
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
all
the
way
to
ma
to
get
this
stuff
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
constantly
these
are
very
easy
to
put
down
a
bit
moreso
than
when
bottled
summary
more
than
your
standard
pale
ale
very
bitter
hops
but
not
aggressively
so
smooth
finish
drinkable
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
redorange
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
not
a
great
deal
of
aroma
whats
there
is
faintly
hoppy
but
a
little
different
ah
thats
what
it
is
the
rye
is
evident
at
first
sip
taste
starts
out
creamy
with
a
good
malt
profile
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
rye
makes
its
presence
known
throughout
very
tasty
feel
is
creamy
with
appropriate
carbonation
very
drinkable
ipa
another
solid
offering
from
founders
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
pours
dark
red
with
small
offwhite
head
dusty
sediment
visible
not
getting
much
rye
in
the
smell
getting
mostly
caramel
sweetness
and
hops
hmm
interesting
taste
i
am
definitely
getting
a
subtle
rye
taste
which
i
like
alot
a
lot
less
hops
than
i
expected
maybe
i
have
an
old
bottle
tastes
of
pine
and
wood
work
great
here
as
well
still
getting
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
too
which
balances
out
the
more
dense
previously
mentioned
tastes
no
alcohol
taste
present
here
and
the
tastes
arent
overpowering
i
would
not
session
it
though
mostly
because
of
its
slight
heaviness
another
excellent
and
complex
offering
from
founders
overall
at
70
ibus
the
founders
reds
rye
is
right
up
my
alley
as
much
as
i
love
to
jump
all
over
the
place
with
my
beer
selections
during
a
night
out
if
i
find
founders
red
rye
i
stick
with
it
for
the
evening
it
also
makes
a
fantastic
six
pack
to
bring
home
and
unwind
with
pours
a
rich
reddish
mahogany
brown
with
subdued
carbonation
a
smallish
parchment
head
and
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
plenty
of
grapefruit
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
rye
seed
twinge
in
the
background
flavor
is
quite
nice
extremely
well
balanced
complex
yet
nuanced
plenty
of
grapefruit
from
the
hops
solid
caramel
and
bready
malt
backbone
and
a
rye
toast
presence
that
compliments
rather
than
dominates
as
in
some
other
rye
beers
this
beer
has
a
firm
bitterness
that
once
again
seems
to
meld
with
the
other
flavor
aspects
very
tasty
medium
bodied
with
a
wonderful
surprisingly
smooth
mouthfeel
and
great
semidry
finish
oh
and
this
finish
is
miles
long
i
take
a
break
to
type
and
the
rye
lingers
on
my
tounge
i
am
not
the
worlds
biggest
rye
fanboy
but
this
one
is
well
executed
and
extremely
drinkable
strongly
recommended
by
a
friend
from
founders
home
of
grand
rapids
back
in
my
native
mitten
i
have
to
agree
that
this
is
a
top
notch
offering
from
one
of
the
midwests
premier
brewers
overall
impression
another
winner
from
founders
it
has
a
good
malt
backbone
and
a
little
hoppiness
with
the
unique
twist
of
rye
its
a
jewish
deli
explosion
in
my
mouth
oye
vey
o
my
favorite
hop
bomb
pick
this
one
up
if
you
like
em
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
although
theyre
sometimes
excellent
many
other
well
known
american
brews
that
use
rye
are
essentially
american
ipas
with
rye
thrown
in
to
up
the
complexity
while
not
quite
as
hop
forward
as
something
like
hop
rod
rye
the
way
the
rye
is
so
skillfully
showcased
really
makes
this
a
special
beverage
this
would
definitely
be
a
regular
in
the
fridge
if
i
could
find
it
locally
hard
to
find
any
major
fault
with
this
beer
very
drinkable
for
such
a
bitter
flavorful
brew
all
in
all
a
good
brew
but
doesnt
stand
out
the
reds
rye
pa
pours
an
amber
almost
copper
color
with
a
thin
1
finger
head
and
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
sweet
malts
and
caramel
a
solid
hop
backbone
that
rounds
out
the
nose
the
grains
are
much
more
prominent
in
the
quaff
along
with
a
nice
candy
sweet
finish
also
some
citrus
orange
peels
and
lemons
not
much
hoppiness
is
noted
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
medium
weight
but
smooth
drinkability
is
on
queue
with
this
one
a
very
sessionable
brew
overall
this
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
i
remembered
perhaps
because
the
bottles
i
had
were
gushers
and
by
the
time
the
head
settled
in
my
glass
it
was
absurdly
smooth
still
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
is
well
worth
a
shot
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
my
favorite
rye
beer
to
date
although
its
very
hard
to
pick
out
a
whole
lot
of
the
rye
because
of
the
dominating
hops
i
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
a
fresher
bottle
because
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
great
for
lounging
around
in
the
late
summer
or
fall
im
not
going
to
complain
about
drinking
it
under
all
this
snow
right
now
though
because
this
is
a
very
good
brew
from
a
brewery
that
never
disappoints
a
stunning
beer
beautiful
pour
rich
redamber
color
smell
of
honeyvanillapine
the
flavor
is
exceptionally
good
rich
rewarding
balanced
a
real
knockout
the
peppery
punch
of
the
rye
is
offset
wonderfully
by
the
ipa
hop
kick
flavors
of
honey
and
dry
clean
hops
are
dominant
but
not
overbearing
this
brew
is
your
master
but
it
is
kind
and
benevolent
washes
down
like
silk
and
the
aftertaste
really
blooms
the
flavors
nicely
hops
are
very
pronounced
but
not
straight
pine
or
citrus
something
else
that
is
much
better
founders
wins
again
poured
it
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
good
amount
of
thick
head
i
let
the
beer
sit
while
i
ironed
a
shirt
when
i
came
back
to
it
there
was
still
some
head
left
with
a
good
amount
of
thick
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
of
rye
but
at
the
same
time
crisp
and
almost
citrusy
the
taste
is
exactly
what
i
expected
its
an
ipa
with
a
good
malt
backbone
but
with
a
powerful
rye
taste
to
it
didnt
know
if
these
two
flavors
would
blend
well
but
the
taste
is
exceptional
i
get
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
taste
too
a
lot
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
it
thick
with
a
bit
of
sediment
that
you
can
sense
substantial
but
smooth
i
could
only
see
me
drinking
a
couple
of
these
because
they
are
thick
and
filling
i
must
be
missing
something
on
this
beer
it
was
my
first
rye
beer
so
maybe
that
could
explain
it
i
need
to
give
this
beer
another
try
at
some
point
it
looked
very
good
but
the
taste
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
much
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
i
didnt
find
the
smell
of
this
beer
to
be
to
appetizing
either
im
way
off
all
the
other
ratings
so
i
will
need
to
try
this
again
not
as
dry
as
i
would
like
it
sticks
around
a
little
in
the
mouth

great

from

they
make
some
amazing
world
class
brews
i
dont
know
if
id
call
this
one
world
class
but
its
an
amazing
beer
and
world
class
in
its
own
style
great
job
founders
overall
another
delicious
offering
from
founders
love
that
bit
of
rye
flavor
and
good
hoppy
bite
this
is
a
good
beer
i
dont
love
it
but
i
had
a
craving
for
rye
and
it
hit
the
spot
d
a
very
good
beer
absolutely
worth
a
try
very
sweet
and
very
falvorful
d
another
very
nice
beer
from
founders
ive
said
it
before
but
rye
works
wonderfully
in
this
style
of
beer
matched
with
some
caramel
maltiness
and
a
big
kiss
of
american
hops
its
no
hop
rod
rye
but
its
a
most
acceptable
runnerup
wonderful
beer
wish
id
taken
my
friends
recommendation
sooner
wont
even
doubt
him
again
pours
out
a
very
dark
red
almost
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
that
is
very
foamycreamy
with
amazing
retention
the
head
doesnt
wanna
go
away
and
leaves
offwhite
thick
lacing
behind
the
lacing
itself
comes
off
the
glass
about
a
millimeter
or
two
by
my
standards
this
is
pretty
much
as
good
as
it
gets
for
apperance
smell
is
of
great
fresh
hops
and
some
pale
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
malts
remind
me
of
homebrewing
the
hops
come
through
with
earthy
fruity
and
herbal
notes
the
strength
of
the
nose
is
good
and
the
hop
aroma
stays
throughout
the
whole
experience
the
hop
aroma
of
this
bad
boy
could
rival
almost
any
ipa
i
have
had
taste
is
like
the
nose
but
does
not
fade
the
hops
are
great
in
flavor
and
bitterness
piney
and
earthy
hops
dominate
and
the
fruity
ones
take
a
back
seat
the
malts
are
very
pleasant
and
the
rye
likewise
malts
are
have
some
caramel
hints
and
balance
the
hops
very
nicely
the
rye
creates
a
flavor
i
am
not
used
to
but
i
enjoy
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
rye
beer
overall
the
flavor
is
great
and
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
this
beer
the
body
is
moderate
the
carbonation
is
right
where
i
want
it
and
medium
in
strength
the
only
thing
i
would
want
is
a
bit
more
creaminess
there
is
a
huge
warmth
which
i
did
not
expect
but
it
adds
to
the
experience
since
i
cannot
taste
the
alcohol
creating
this
feeling
drinkability
i
have
been
searching
for
a
sessionable
founders
beer
that
is
great
this
is
it
the
price
is
on
the
higher
end
for
a
session
beer
but
it
is
worth
it
after
a
six
pack
of
these
i
would
be
in
a
perfect
place
this
is
now
my
go
to
beer
due
to
the
great
hop
aroma
and
balanced
flavor
what
a
nice
surprise
smells
of
orange
peel
and
tangerines
tastes
of
caramel
and
hops
up
front
and
finishes
with
a
big
citrus
punch
pours
a
light
amber
with
decent
head
an
excellent
pale
ale
very
reminiscent
of
dales
pale
ale
with
more
caramel
tones
i
do
not
pick
up
on
the
rye
much
md
full
body
with
an
excellently
long
finish
its
brilliantly
spicy
and
sweet
with
the
hop
bitterness
rounding
it
out
extremely
well
i
wish
new
york
had
founders
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
great
the
first
time
i
tried
this
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
shot
i
love
the
sweet
citric
juice
flavor
that
dominates
this
one
also
a
great
spiciness
from
the
dry
hopping
and
the
rye
adds
a
unique
characteristic
that
i
like
definitely
worth
checkin
out
d
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
as
it
would
surely
jump
to
the
top
of
my
regular
brews
unlike
most
of
the
rye
stuff
i
have
had
before
but
good
would
definitely
enjoy
another
this
beer
was
wonderful
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
on
the
market
imo
there
is
grapefruit
zest
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
imparts
grapefruit
juice
cant
say
i
taste
rye
as
an
ingredient
but
there
was
a
mineral
after
taste
in
the
drying
finish
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
that
may
have
been
to
rye
slightly
thickchewy
mouthfeel
this
beats
out
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
any
day
of
the
week
i
initially
had
this
at
a
bar
a
while
back
and
thought
it
was
great
i
like
it
even
more
now

good
beer
i
have
to
say
i
was
expecting
more
being
a
big
fan
of
rye
founders
hoping
for
a
blowouttathewater
kind
of
rye
and
looking
at
the
bottling
date
i
wonder
if
mn
got
a
few
old
shipments
ill
give
this
another
shot
with
a
bottle
thats
fresher
with
i
hope
even
better
results
f
finishes
dry
and
bitter
both
accent
each
other
the
rye
flavor
also
lingers
for
a
bit
and
seems
to
lead
to
this
fruit
punch
like
flavor
as
it
fades
it
has
a
spicy
almost
quality
as
well
like
spicy
spicy
bitterness
lingers
but
its
nice
this
is
actually
a
really
enjoyable
beer
for
a
rye
whisky
fan
and
it
has
a
lot
of
great
qualities
the
mouthfeel
is
viscous
with
a
long
lingering
bitterness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
purchased
more
than
a
single
bottle
i
poured
this
in
my
duvel
glass
and
the
head
started
off
good
and
retained
some
small
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
was
very
spicy
like
fresh
cracked
pepper
with
a
candied
sugar
tone
on
the
fade
the
taste
starts
with
a
bold
hop
presence
that
quickly
goes
to
a
yeasty
dark
toasted
bread
flavor
the
second
wave
of
flavor
seems
to
be
a
dark
cherry
fruit
mixed
with
a
touch
of
black
liquorish
the
finish
is
dry
and
spicy
making
your
taste
buds
yearn
for
more
this
would
go
great
with
hot
wings
cheers
finished
my
last
of
my
first
6pack
last
night
and
bumped
the
score
up
a
bit
this
is
really
a
fantastic
rye
pale
ale
the
best
ive
had
outside
of
terrapin
ryesquared
hop
heads
would
love
this
one
very
hoppy
and
man
that
rye
malt
works
really
well
here
to
balance
things
out
the
rye
malt
profile
is
great
it
complements
the
hops
nicely
and
has
a
complexity
throughout
the
drink
that
changes
from
a
soft
bread
flavor
to
a
much
sharper
kind
of
spicy
grain
edge
the
hops
of
the
other
hand
are
just
really
well
balanced
and
perfectly
involved
in
kicking
this
up
the
hops
are
somewhat
grassy
but
really
kind
of
fruity
and
bitter
at
the
end
with
an
awesome
finish
the
mouth
feel
also
kicks
ass
on
this
very
smooth
and
full
pours
mostly
amber
with
a
little
rednice
little
redish
copper
head
that
dissipates
quicklyno
mistake
this
beer
is
a
rye
from
the
smell
and
taste
malt
and
rye
and
nice
hop
balanceit
reminds
me
of
the
caraway
seed
in
a
loaf
of
rye
breadnot
overpowering
but
wanting
another
slicethis
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
solid
rye
a
solid
brew
i
wish
it
werent
so
expensive
around
13fourpack
here
d
a
fine
tasty
beer
maybe
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
nice
though
another
solid
beer
from
the
folks
at
founders
ive
heard
this
described
as
a
pale
ale
with
rye
but
what
i
had
on
tap
was
certainly
more
of
a
rye
ipa
regardless
the
rye
characteristics
balanced
the
heavy
hops
well
and
added
only
positive
things
to
the
drinking
experience
simply
put
its
really
good
a
beer
that
deserves
regular
fridge
time
this
is
a
bit
strong
at
6
60
abv
but
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
its
not
terribly
complex
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
beer
not
needing
to
be
full
of
hops
or
having
a
ton
of
flavors
in
order
to
be
great
simpler
can
be
better
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
enjoyable
a
wellcrafted
beer
can
be
a
must
for
any
hophead
looking
for
a
more
sublime
drinking
experience
poured
a
cloudy
amber
brown
with
three
fingers
of
offwhite
head
with
fantastic
lacing
the
smell
was
dominated
by
pink
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
very
pungent
the
taste
was
much
more
complex
starting
with
malty
toffee
caramel
earthiness
which
dissolved
to
a
nice
citrus
fruitmalt
balance
and
then
finishing
with
soft
citrus
creamy
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
very
little
evidence
present
of
carawayrye
but
nonetheless
a
very
sessionable
and
tasty
brew
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
showcasing
both
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
floral
grassy
and
grapefruit
hoppiness
play
nicely
with
the
zesty
pepper
and
breadloaf
rye
flavors
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
there
to
help
smooth
things
out
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
and
body
on
the
beer
are
just
about
right
for
the
style
and
ill
be
damned
if
reds
rye
is
not
far
from
chuggable
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
get
sick
of
drinking
this
brew
and
am
very
sad
this
is
the
last
of
a
six
pack
i
got
for
christmas
thanks
dad
unbelievable
beer
great
job
as
usual
founders
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
somewhat
easily
available
rye
beers
out
in
the
market
and
i
thoroughly
enjoy
it
lets
start
with
the
head
i
poured
this
baby
somewhat
lightly
and
there
was
about
a
14
of
mountainous
head
domed
above
the
rim
big
bubbles
small
bubbles
bubbles
o
plenty
an
off
white
head
rests
proudly
atop
a
beautiful
hazy
red
ale
the
laser
etched
bottom
sends
lanes
of
carbonation
racing
to
meet
up
with
the
rest
of
the
trapped
bubbles
at
the
bottom
of
what
seems
to
be
a
never
dying
pile
of
head
the
lacing
shows
evidence
of
the
beer
levels
before
i
took
my
last
few
quaffs
the
sweet
grain
and
rye
spiciness
combine
with
the
citrus
minty
hops
witch
are
coating
my
tongue
as
i
type
the
thought
of
another
sip
is
satisfying
only
reminding
me
the
end
of
this
glass
is
nearing
aroma
taste
and
aftertaste
compliment
each
other
well
giving
this
ale
a
three
ring
show
d
drinkability
is
good
it
gives
you
a
very
warm
feeling
right
at
the
end
of
every
sip
i
was
able
to
consume
one
faster
than
the
usual
ale
this
goes
great
with
bread
and
gouda
cheeese
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
these
poured
into
a
pint
glass
left
a
finger
and
a
half
of
offwhite
head
loose
bubbly
lacing
going
down
smell
is
rye
hoppy
raw
grain
taste
is
superb
lots
of
rye
and
hop
some
citrus
action
going
on
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
mild
carbonation
i
like
this
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
as
i
drink
that
last
few
sips
when
it
had
really
warmed
up
this
is
really
really
tasty
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
have
been
enjoying
this
beer
for
a
few
years
now
and
it
never
gets
old
hands
down
this
and
2bros
cane
ebel
are
the
best
rye
beers
out
there
go
seek
them
out
d
founders
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
and
this
beer
is
just
another
reason
why
a
really
good
ryepa
reds
rye
is
pretty
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
bad
there
just
wasnt
much
about
this
beer
that
stood
out
good
but
this
wasnt
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
nor
one
of
the
better
p
a
s
d
the
flavor
and
balance
make
for
a
wildly
drinkable
rye
beer
this
one
should
not
disappoint
a
great
ale
founders
brewers
know
what
there
doing
and
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
brews
that
thay
are
capable
of
highly
drinkable
enjoy
cheers
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
a
think
lacy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
sweet
citrus
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
semitart
citrus
hop
bitterness
with
subtle
vinous
characteristics
and
a
well
balanced
malt
backbone
the
body
is
mildly
heavy
with
moderate
carbonation
levels
and
is
very
drinkable
the
finish
fades
gently
with
tart
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
vinous
qualities
ends
with
a
gentle
warming
sensation
a
great
beer
more
of
an
ipa
with
a
little
rye
but
still
a
really
good
rye
beer
something
i
would
recommend
drinkability
good
but
not
a
session
ale
for
me
you
dont
need
more
than
a
couple
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
gasoline
colored
and
did
have
a
pretty
nice
head
the
color
of
the
head
was
a
light
tan
the
beer
had
a
truly
hoppy
smell
to
it
and
the
beer
had
a
truly
hoppy
taste
to
it
also
it
reminded
me
of
eating
a
cypress
tree
i
will
not
buy
again
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
not
spritzy
its
from
the
spicey
pepper
character
nice
and
interesting
brew
overall
nice
rye
p
a
not
my
favorite
beer
but
probably
my
favorite
rye
admittedly
i
usually
dont
like
rye
beers
too
much
but
this
one
isnt
dominated
by
the
rye
and
strikes
a
nice
balance
with
the
hops
if
you
see
it
and
like
rye
or
hops
or
even
arent
totally
turned
off
by
hops
give
it
a
shot
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
something
im
going
to
drink
often
d
pretty
good
i
would
have
had
a
couple
more
if
i
was
eating
dinner
instead
of
lunch
went
great
with
a
burger
and
fries
d
very
good
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
really
presents
itself
nicely
moderate
and
fresh
balanced
i
like
the
rye
it
is
strong
with
hops
really
good
beer
on
another
note
i
would
categorize
this
is
an
ipa
rather
than
a
rye
beer
i
assume
the
name
of
the
beer
is
a
play
on
words
its
like
a
little
brother
of
hotd
blue
dot
which
is
definitely
considered
a
dipa
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
the
fruit
component
until
i
had
a
second
bottle
days
later
and
was
smacked
in
the
face
with
the
grapefruit
i
am
hoarding
two
bottles
that
are
left
reminds
me
of
a
mix
of
hop
rod
rye
and
hop
stoopid
and
anything
that
tastes
like
the
lovechild
of
those
two
beers
has
to
be
good
thank
you
founders
just
a
really
great
beer
the
flavors
all
complement
each
other
nicely
while
not
a
all
nighter
could
easily
be
an
every
nighter
for
me
i
think
founders
sometimes
tries
too
hard
with
their
gigantic
ambitious
offerings
but
this
one
is
spot
on
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
reasonably
priced
to
boot
hazy
copper
color
with
a
rich
off
white
head
lots
of
rye
right
off
the
bat
floral
hops
and
then
some
citrus
the
rye
was
also
the
first
taste
on
the
palette
lots
of
hops
again
more
floral
than
pine
and
the
citrus
is
just
a
hint
to
me
this
is
definitely
better
than
hop
rod
rye
then
again
hop
rod
is
considered
an
ipa
and
has
less
rye
this
is
superb
i
could
see
this
as
a
regular
if
it
were
more
readily
available
oddly
enough
ive
rated
a
couple
other
offerings
from
founders
higher
but
if
i
had
to
pick
one
of
their
beers
to
sit
and
drink
all
night
this
would
be
the
one
d
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
d
really
a
nice
rye
beer
try
it
if
you
can
cheers
pours
a
beautiful
crimson
red
with
a
creamy
tan
head
nicely
balanced
with
its
hop
bitterness
and
floral
bouquet
achieved
from
the
dry
hop
in
the
finish
the
generous
amount
of
malted
rye
used
gives
it
a
spicy
crisp
finish
this
is
better
a
little
warmer
flavor
bursts
when
around
46
deg
its
not
a
cloying
rye
and
the
body
is
lighter
than
i
though
it
would
be
and
not
in
a
bad
way
drinkable
maybe
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
i
think
ill
have
another
the
appearance
is
of
a
light
amber
to
almost
sunset
orange
very
nice
carbonation
a
pale
ale
that
has
a
clean
roasted
malt
bouquet
with
candied
citrus
aromas
this
beer
definitely
has
the
rye
and
raosted
barley
flavors
not
a
typical
pale
ale
but
a
wonderful
different
example
of
a
great
founders
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
and
long
lasting
i
found
this
beer
is
a
nice
complement
with
food
like
anything
grilled
overall
it
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
to
enjoy
over
a
relaxing
evening
drinkability
i
liked
this
in
bottle
but
like
it
even
more
on
draft
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
easily
have
ordered
2
or
3
more
this
one
stays
on
my
shopping
list
and
ill
be
having
more
next
time
i
find
it
on
draft
overall
very
pleased
with
this
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
dont
think
it
was
supposed
to
just
a
really
good
take
on
some
classic
flavors
not
too
challenging
and
exciting
to
try
yet
another
great
offering
from
founders
very
complex
and
bold
flavor
truly
a
treat
for
the
palate
and
sure
to
alleviate
any
hop
craving
d
while
fairly
hoppy
and
a
little
strong
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
actually
kind
of
nice
summer
session
beer
d
very
drinkable
it
is
simply
a
smooth
good
tasting
beer
its
not
going
to
pound
your
palete
nor
will
it
knock
your
socks
off
with
amazing
flavors
what
it
will
do
is
deliver
a
solid
all
around
beer
that
wont
let
you
dont
in
any
category
feel
and
drinkability
creamy
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
in
check
and
it
just
goes
down
smooth
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
myself
going
after
another
sixer
of
this
easily
and
in
the
near
future
body
is
mediumlight
helped
by
carbonation
which
gives
it
a
lighter
feel
than
what
it
actually
has
finishes
clean
and
semidry
bitterness
lingers
rye
character
lingers
at
the
end
too
hard
to
say
what
its
like
but
i
know
that
it
is
different
than
any
kind
of
flavor
you
get
from
barley
very
nice
all
in
all
pours
a
deep
dark
hazy
ruby
red
with
a
nice
tan
head
smells
like
a
sweet
ipa
caramel
covered
apples
and
a
candy
tartness
taste
is
wellbalanced
between
a
green
apple
bitterness
candy
tanginess
and
caramel
sweetness
theres
also
a
woody
element
that
i
find
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
big
and
bold
beer
and
i
dig
it
big
time
this
was
my
first
rye
beer
to
me
it
had
some
of
the
best
elements
of
amber
ales
and
lowbitterness
ipas
neither
of
which
are
favorite
styles
of
mine
that
said
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
next
time
i
want
something
hoppy
andor
red
ill
think
of
this
dark
amber
color
with
thick
and
frothy
beige
head
some
visible
prickle
bubbles
some
of
which
are
moving
the
nose
is
a
little
heavy
sweet
and
floral
at
first
i
thought
of
describing
it
as
muted
but
that
isnt
correct
it
comes
through
clearly
but
is
heavy
and
hangs
low
if
that
makes
any
sense
good
balance
nice
malt
presence
and
pleasantly
hoppy
the
hops
must
be
chinook
as
its
very
similar
to
the
rye
pa
i
had
at
great
waters
in
saint
paul
and
the
chinook
hops
was
the
unique
quality
i
am
almost
certain
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
than
many
ales
the
sweet
presence
of
the
chinook
if
i
am
indeed
correct
works
well
to
enhance
the
malt
flavor
deinitely
a
hoppy
beer
but
not
just
for
hoppy
beer
drinkers
medium
orangeamber
with
a
small
slightly
offwhite
head
the
diminishes
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
film
beautiful
pine
and
citrus
hops
aroma
a
lightly
caramel
a
dn
grainy
backbone
barely
making
its
presence
known
tastewise
wow
this
is
good
huge
hops
right
off
the
bat
like
the
nose
lots
of
citrus
and
some
pine
a
little
spicy
as
the
caramel
starts
to
show
a
mouthwatering
finish
that
turns
floral
as
it
slowly
fades
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
moderate
carbonation
and
a
light
hoppyspicy
sting
to
it
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
big
hops
presence
without
being
a
big
beer
every
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
definitely
worth
trying
moreys
bottom
line
this
beer
is
right
up
there
with
nosferatu
as
far
as
my
favorite
red
ales
are
concerned
one
of
the
best
not
my
favorite
founders
but
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
other
ryes
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
and
quite
enjoyable
i
could
see
this
as
a
possible
session
beer
and
i
plan
to
get
some
more
notes
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
highly
hopped
beers
but
they
have
been
growing
on
me
this
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
a
very
hoppy
beer
with
good
bready
balance
and
awesome
feel
overall
this
tastes
like
a
distinct
brew
from
the
regular
reds
rye
but
it
is
definitely
nice
in
its
own
way
i
think
i
prefer
the
other
one
a
little
better
nice
beer
i
think
this
one
is
dominated
by
the
pine
which
i
love
every
sip
invites
another
if
founders
was
sold
in
nys
this
would
definitely
be
one
of
the
staples
in
my
fridge
get
some
d
i
doubt
i
would
have
a
problem
drinking
these
one
after
the
other
but
i
have
found
myself
enjoying
each
one
on
its
own
as
its
own
experience
from
first
sip
to
the
last
grainy
little
sip
at
the
bottom
i
will
be
buying
a
case
of
this
next
time
i
head
out
to
the
store
everyone
should
try
this
rye
may
be
where
its
at
ill
have
to
try
more
rye
style
beers
now
i
have
a
feeling
that
once
i
got
two
of
these
in
me
id
be
able
to
drink
them
all
night
long
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
overall
impression
hugely
drinkable
dangerously
so
given
the
abv
lots
of
interesting
flavors
here
great
for
hop
heads
the
nose
is
definitely
spicey
hops
definitely
hoppier
than
malty
though
what
malt
flavor
you
get
is
rye
there
is
a
definite
floral
component
to
the
beer
too
one
which
balances
the
strong
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
caramel
the
red
rye
color
and
finish
are
really
noteworthy
as
the
creamy
head
lasted
until
i
finished
the
beer
and
washed
away
the
graininess
in
the
finish
the
hop
structure
was
clean
and
the
carbonation
soft
not
too
dry
likely
used
a
very
acidic
soft
water
to
break
down
the
rye
as
well
as
they
did
the
punchy
bitterness
is
a
surprise
at
first
but
it
melds
nicely
with
the
spicy
rye
light
caramel
sweetness
and
herbal
hop
flavor
this
has
the
bitterness
of
an
ipa
but
the
flavor
comes
more
from
the
earthy
spicy
slightly
sour
rye
malt
than
it
does
from
the
hops
i
get
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
midpalate
mango
and
pineapple
the
finish
is
dry
bitter
and
lingering
almost
excessively
so
but
its
not
an
astringent
bitterness
enjoyable
stuff
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
with
red
highlights
capped
by
a
couple
of
fingers
of
cream
colored
head
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
dance
up
to
the
surface
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
citrus
grains
and
caramel
in
the
flavor
is
where
these
are
presented
more
interestingly
with
hops
and
malts
striking
a
fine
balance
featuring
said
citrus
and
caramel
the
rye
is
allowed
to
shine
here
with
nutty
spicy
and
earthy
twang
some
hints
of
honey
especially
in
the
coating
mouthfeel
body
remains
in
the
middle
and
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
on
the
other
hand
one
is
oh
so
enjoyable
the
best
rye
beer
ive
had
to
datethanks
again
founders
d
very
drinkable
is
a
great
session
beer
for
me
look
forward
to
drinking
again
d
as
i
said
earlier
this
beer
drinks
like
it
has
34
alcohol
it
is
hidden
very
well
could
drink
these
all
night
long
too
bad
i
dont
have
regular
access
to
it
drinkability
you
must
try
this
beer
its
unlike
anything
else
youve
ever
had
hops
fruit
rye
whats
not
to
like
i
paired
this
with
a
hearty
bowl
of
bean
soup
on
a
chilly
autumn
evening
and
was
really
enjoying
myself
the
beer
started
out
with
a
nice
redish
look
the
taste
gives
way
to
a
piney
citrus
taste
with
a
great
hoppy
aftertaste
it
is
nearly
ipa
like
with
its
flavor
the
rye
taste
helps
mellow
out
the
hops
giving
this
beer
excellent
drinkability
an
exceptional
beer
with
terrific
flavor
i
would
gladly
have
23
of
these
in
a
row
without
getting
tired
of
them
very
nicely
balanced
and
finished
d
founders
is
a
great
brewery
reds
rye
is
an
exceptional
session
beer
plenty
of
hops
for
my
liking
balanced
with
a
strong
malt
profile
of
caramel
and
rye
highly
recommended
i
say
highly
recommended
makes
me
want
to
make
a
honeybaked
ham
sandwich
one
rye
wsome
hops
instead
of
lettuce
mmmm
went
pretty
damn
well
with
the
fried
brie
and
apples
at
fuel
and
fuddle
d
very
drinkable
great
beer
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
nice
balance
and
flavor
poured
into
pint
glass
and
after
pouring
a
thrid
of
the
bottle
the
head
overtook
the
glass
massive
thick
rocky
head
with
lots
of
lacing
hazy
and
rusty
offwhite
head
smell
was
a
bit
strong
of
a
sweet
caramel
with
some
hops
almost
barleywineish
taste
was
comlex
some
caramel
little
hops
malt
some
toasted
grain
and
other
earthy
flavors
fuller
mouthfeel
smooth
and
somewhat
velvety
overall
a
good
beer
but
somethinga
about
it
just
didnt
hit
home
for
me
drinkability
this
thing
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
an
imperial
something
but
at
just
6
8
it
makes
a
nice
daily
drinker
we
drank
a
bunch
of
these
on
the
beach
a
few
weeks
ago
very
refreshing
so
delicious
served
warm
the
heavy
licorice
taste
can
overwhelm
drink
is
simply
good
a
drinkable
beer
but
a
little
much
for
me
to
have
more
than
a
few
dvery
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
as
with
the
centennial
ipa
if
this
was
offered
localy
i
could
easily
see
myself
choosing
this
one
as
i
would
to
have
more
of
this
not
my
favorite
but
yet
a
very
good
beer
from
the
people
at
founders
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
and
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
smells
of
rye
grapefruit
and
pine
taste
is
also
hoppy
but
there
is
a
sweet
malt
backbone
which
gives
this
beer
nice
balance
the
rye
flavor
comes
through
nicely
has
a
medium
body
and
proper
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
very
nicely
made
as
others
have
also
said
tasted
very
similar
to
a
ipa
due
to
strong
hops
definitely
an
enjoyable
offering
from
founders
its
hits
all
the
right
notes
cheers
red
d
fair
as
this
is
a
huge
tasting
beer
with
a
moderate
abv
3

this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
fullflavored
and
its
sour
spicy
flavors
go
really
well
with
peppery
food
dark
red
with
haze
nice
complete
yellowish
head
small
bubbles
cover
the
beer
in
a
thick
layer
alcohol
and
strong
aroma
of
hops
almost
pine
like
aroma
familar
think
rogue
yellow
snow
interesting
flavor
the
rye
no
doubt
how
much
rye
was
this
made
with
very
dominant
rye
flavor
almost
no
aftertaste
very
smooth
a
nice
drink
slow
to
drink
probably
due
to
the
lateness
and
my
current
state
drinkability
excellent
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
consistently
and
often
well
worth
a
try
a
fullbodied
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
my
first
founders
and
it
did
not
disappoint
m
d
creamy
and
thick
bodied
leaves
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
ending
lingering
on
the
tongue
6

abv
is
well
masked
this
is
an
excellent
brew
founders
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
anyone
who
loves
ipas
will
love
this
brew
even
though
its
a
rye
one
i
will
recommend
to
my
friends
d
very
high
but
i
cannont
imagine
having
more
than
24
oz
in
a
single
session
outstanding
flavor
but
it
could
be
an
overload
to
the
senses
after
2
that
being
said
i
wish
i
had
more
to
keep
onhand
for
when
the
mood
strikes
for
another
damn
you
founders
bring
your
nectar
to
the
mile
high
city
drinks
ok
this
is
such
a
different
taste
with
my
first
experience
with
rye
beer
it
has
smooth
parts
though
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
such
that
you
could
sip
and
enjoy
it
or
pound
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
picked
up
a
single
to
try
this
as
founders
makes
some
excellent
beers
not
as
much
rye
flavor
as
i
was
expecting
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
ipa
that
was
shifted
to
the
bitter
side
hopefully
someday
i
can
try
their
black
rye
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
think
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
around
for
a
hoppy
session
beer
just
a
great
drinking
beer
at
a
great
price
with
a
nice
touch
of
rye
that
i
really
like
the
mouth
is
decent
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
crispness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
big
malty
sweetness
starts
the
beer
off
but
this
gives
way
to
a
nice
mellow
bitterness
lots
of
caramel
bitter
rye
and
finishes
toasty
and
bready
i
dig
this
i
guess
theres
a
a
reds
rye
and
a
reds
rye
p
a
i
wonder
how
different
they
are
recommend
dvery
drinkable
that
simple
im
glad
that
founders
is
now
available
in
the
twin
cities
as
this
brew
is
delicious
i
look
forward
to
further
encounters
with
this
brewery
this
is
one
tasty
brew
and
with
a
relatively
low
abv
it
can
be
enjoyed
in
multiples
this
is
not
a
style
i
am
terribly
familiar
with
but
the
ryepa
was
excellent
in
all
aspects
amazing
founders
reds
rye
pa
poured
a
great
red
color
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
the
smell
was
a
great
combination
of
rye
and
hops
the
rye
aroma
was
very
inviting
and
even
more
intriguing
coming
from
this
red
brew
the
floral
and
citrus
hops
gave
the
nose
a
distinctive
ipa
bouquet
the
taste
was
an
incredible
combination
of
base
and
adjunct
malts
up
front
with
a
robust
hop
finish
the
malts
approach
with
a
rich
sweetness
and
the
distinct
taste
of
rye
as
the
malt
mellows
the
hops
take
over
with
floral
notes
on
the
tongue
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
toward
the
back
of
the
throat
the
aftertaste
is
hoppy
but
nice
this
beer
finishes
clean
and
does
not
leave
the
mouth
sticky
making
it
very
drinkable
but
beware
of
the
6
6
abv
this
drinkable
beer
can
add
up
fast
reds
rye
pa
is
a
fantastic
new
take
on
the
classic
ipa
rye
beers
are
so
few
as
it
is
so
coupling
the
unique
taste
of
rye
with
the
punch
of
an
ipa
makes
for
a
unique
enjoyable
beer
experience
cheers
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
had
in
some
time
a
sixpack
would
not
last
too
long
in
my
house
overall
this
beer
freaking
rocks
and
i
may
need
to
make
sure
i
have
some
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
no
problem
reaching
for
a
2nd
or
3rd
i
would
like
more
rye
in
the
flavor
but
it
adds
a
depth
to
the
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
different
from
a
apaipa
i
really
like
this
beer
will
definitely
purchase
again
worth
trying
one
of
my
favorites
a
nice
treat
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewer
well
balanced
rye
ipa
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
close
a
a
thick
rocky
head
from
a
medium
pour
lots
of
foam
which
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
very
clear
amber
to
ruby
color
4
50
s
citrusy
and
piney
a
strong
but
not
overwhelming
sweetness
the
smells
like
overripe
plums
definite
spiciness
on
the
nose
one
of
the
most
inviting
and
smooth
aroma
profiles
ive
experienced
in
some
time
4
75
t
wonderful
hop
bite
which
is
balanced
nicely
with
a
solid
malt
profile
a
little
zing
possibly
from
the
rye
some
caramel
flavors
and
slightly
toasty
grapefruit
on
the
palate
as
well
quite
dry
4
75
m
extremely
smooth
mouth
feel
which
translates
to
a
beer
which
seems
to
linger
on
the
tongue
5
00
d
this
is
one
heck
of
a
drinkable
beer
edges
into
the
territory
of
ipa
while
being
an
exceptional
example
of
an
amber
albeit
a
hoppy
one
i
will
seek
this
beer
out
again
5
00
d
very
drinkable
beer
almost
too
drinkable
i
could
drink
far
too
many
of
these
in
one
session
d
too
many
flavors
here
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
need
a
break
after
one
all
together
an
excellent
brew
very
nice
any
time
but
especially
for
a
cool
fall
day
small
cream
colored
head
on
top
of
a
hazy
amber
body
a
bit
of
a
lace
trail
loads
of
malt
on
the
nose
some
bitter
hops
rye
malt
on
the
taste
a
bit
of
a
bitter
hop
background
bit
of
a
metallic
hint
thin
and
watery
mouth
kind
of
an
interesting
beer
pretty
good
overall
a
perfectly
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
ipa
made
with
rye
a
great
mix
of
the
bitter
hops
flavors
and
the
sweeter
caramelrye
flavors
makes
this
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
from
founders
at
least
of
the
sessionable
nonoverpowering
variety
medium
bodied
and
exceptionally
drinkable
not
overly
intense
or
complex
flavors
but
delicious
cloudy
red
with
a
huge
head
that
takes
a
while
to
go
down
a
mildly
citrus
aroma
once
again
citrus
was
up
front
in
taste
reds
left
me
that
bitter
grapefruit
skin
aftertaste
not
a
complaint
feel
was
nothing
remarkable
still
some
carbonation
left
after
all
the
bubbly
head
at
the
start
several
of
these
would
go
down
well
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
beer
very
solid
brewers
at
founders
d
certainly
a
quality
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
hop
character
out
of
this
beer
but
the
rye
is
front
and
center
on
this
one
im
not
saying
that
as
a
criticism
after
all
this
is
a
rye
beer
i
was
just
expecting
more
interplay
with
a
heavy
hand
of
hops
otherwise
a
very
good
beer
d
moderately
high
to
very
high
clean
great
flavors
make
this
beer
a
treat
going
to
buy
a
case
of
this
for
sure
pours
a
luxurious
copperburnt
orange
with
a
hazy
foamy
thick
head
the
beer
has
a
resiny
and
hoppy
aroma
a
little
more
spruce
like
than
piney
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
malt
rye
and
hops
slightly
sweet
initially
with
a
good
bitterness
following
i
think
this
is
their
best
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
abv
is
respectable
but
not
one
thats
going
to
knock
you
out
after
a
few
the
taste
makes
me
want
to
take
huge
gulps
and
not
put
it
down
opaque
dark
red
with
a
creamy
sticky
head
nose
is
very
sweet
floral
corn
grainyness
if
thats
a
word
sugars
permiate
the
palate
malty
goodness
coats
the
jaws
then
a
blast
of
smoky
hops
and
esters
lingering
bitterness
daring
you
to
put
it
down
which
is
difficult
at
best
mouth
is
sticky
and
chewy
alcohol
is
in
the
back
of
your
mind
reminding
you
that
a
6
of
6
6
that
goes
down
this
quickly
should
probably
be
accompanied
by
a
pregnant
yet
nagging
designated
driver
i
love
this
beer
first
time
in
a
bottle
i
have
enjoyed
pitchers
of
this
sweet
nectar
at
chumleys
in
broad
ripple
with
royce
peacock
but
never
in
a
bottle
its
good
and
damn
good
edit
much
different
as
it
warms
up
i
didnt
realize
but
my
fridge
must
be
a
tad
cold
drinkability
is
high
as
warming
as
is
taste
really
balances
out
the
beer
with
a
slight
caramel
note
on
the
front
must
note
though
cold
eh
cellar
temp
awesome
on
tap
at
the
dilly
deli
10oz
sample
for
3
even
better
on
tap
the
hops
and
rye
really
pop
out
when
its
this
fresh
added
bitterness
is
just
perfect
for
this
beer
just
an
absolute
gem
probably
their
best
beer
i
only
wish
we
would
see
more
founders
kegs
here
in
cincinnati
i
knew
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
good
brew
but
i
didnt
quite
expect
what
i
got
from
this
founders
does
it
again
poured
a
darkreddish
amber
with
an
off
white
head
nose
was
hops
rye
and
malt
taste
was
medium
bodied
caramel
malt
flavor
with
rye
and
hops
very
malty
and
chewy
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
coating
very
drinkableand
tasty
well
done
as
usual
by
founders
such
a
good
beer
dont
know
why
isnt
more
popular
a
great
way
to
shake
up
the
sometimes
boring
and
redundant
pale
ale
category
i
gotta
try
this
with
a
fish
fry
d
well
balanced
rye
have
had
more
extreme
ryes
but
this
one
is
nice
and
drinkable
founders
reds
rye
lives
up
to
the
hype
its
a
big
flavorful
complex
beer
and
one
i
plan
to
enjoy
many
many
more
times
in
the
future
d
great
sessionable
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
worth
every
penny
i
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
a
solid
rye
beer
not
my
favorite
i
somewhat
wish
they
would
have
dialed
back
the
hopping
to
let
more
rye
shine
through
very
tasty
and
interesting
dnice
beer
but
nothing
that
stands
out
to
me
i
would
drink
this
any
time
it
was
offered
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
a
solid
well
done
beer
d
great
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
hanging
out
at
founders
a
great
place
to
visit
founders
never
seems
to
disappoint
i
love
the
rich
copper
color
of
this
beer
you
can
smell
the
hops
and
while
their
is
a
big
hop
taste
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
to
bring
it
all
into
balance
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
at
a
setting
nicely
carbonated
for
solid
body
d
very
drinkable
this
has
a
very
clean
and
solid
flavor
and
the
abv
isnt
too
high
so
its
possible
to
put
back
a
couple
of
these
id
love
to
have
this
again
what
an
amazing
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
had
this
with
a
bbq
last
week
and
i
ended
up
drinking
three
of
them
because
they
were
sliding
down
so
much
i
just
couldnt
put
the
glass
down
tonight
as
i
review
it
i
have
similar
thoughts
great
beer
i
have
the
new
tyranena
rye
bitter
woman
and
i
am
saving
the
last
one
of
these
to
try
side
by
side
with
that
one
this
tastes
like
someones
third
batch
of
homebrew
ive
heard
a
lot
of
great
things
about
founders
and
being
a
mi
native
i
was
very
excited
to
see
it
in
nc
i
really
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
but
it
makes
me
wary
of
blowing
another
10
on
their
beer
as
i
have
said
before
in
my
opinion
founders
can
do
no
wrong
each
new
beer
i
try
from
them
is
excellent
oelergud
wonderful
redamber
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
initially
the
lacing
that
was
left
was
pretty
substantial
and
sticky
but
i
really
like
to
swirl
which
reinvigorates
the
head
but
removes
the
lace
i
could
just
smell
sniff
sniff
this
beer
grapefruit
really
intoxicatingly
crisp
citrusy
grapefruit
with
a
side
of
pine
on
the
palate
the
rye
adds
a
great
spicy
quality
to
the
subtly
sweet
malt
flavors
the
hop
bitterness
helps
to
create
a
clean
finish
and
then
lingers
quite
nicely
reds
rye
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
that
is
at
the
same
time
smooth
and
a
bit
prickly
from
the
carbonation
if
the
beer
didnt
smell
so
good
and
have
such
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
i
would
have
drank
it
faster
d
this
was
my
first
experience
with
rye
and
i
was
very
pleased
it
was
like
an
ipa
with
an
added
kick
this
was
definitely
enjoyable

this

thanks
to

this

12oz

served
in
a

a
brilliant
reddish
copper
with
about
a

of
light
tan

big
piny
hop
aroma
starts
off
with
a
solid
malty
base
with
some
spicy

great
hop
bite
that
is
piny
with
some
grapefruit
long
lingering
finish
with
the
hops
im
glad
this
is
available
in
my
area
now
this
is
a
great
beer
d
yes
sir
may
i
have
another
rich

blonde

held

drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
is
pure
ambrosia
poured
a
darkreddish
amber
with
an
off
white
head
i
couldnt
smell
any
aroma
when
i
tried
this
beer
medium
bodied
caramel
malt
flavor
and
no
distinguishable
hop
aftertaste
not
good
for
something
that
is
supposed
to
have
an
ipa
characteristic
it
was
not
balanced
malts
dominated
and
there
was
a
strong
alcohol
taste
overall
this
one
missed
the
mark
overall
not
as
stellar
a
pair
with
my
grilled
lamb
loin
with
chanterelle
gravy
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
not
bad
either
terrific
with
roasted
asparagus
this
is
a
solid
if
quite
bright
and
extroverted
standalone
brew
it
would
also
i
imagine
be
a
hit
with
antipasto
or
coldcut
appetizer
trays
i
marked
it
down
in
drinkability
since
it
was
only
6
8
and
it
seemed
like
it
was
more
the
thickness
and
complexity
from
the
rye
kept
me
from
gulping
it
down
quickly
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
glass
a
nice
dark
red
color
plenty
of
head
to
the
beer
i
did
not
notice
the
spiciness
that
other
reviewers
mention
for
me
the
hops
dominated
with
a
slight
sourness
to
it
the
hops
dominating
is
what
hurt
the
beer
for
me
i
did
not
notice
the
alcohol
and
the
only
problem
with
drinking
the
beer
was
due
to
the
hops
reds
rye
is
creamy
on
the
palate
followed
quickly
by
a
cutting
sharpness
that
works
to
accentuate
the
hop
bitterness
of
this
beer
unfortunately
this
leaves
me
without
much
desire
to
drink
more
cheers
this
brew
is
carbonated
almost
to
perfection
but
the
super
watery
feel
knocks
points
off
drinkability
is
freaking
awesome
middle
of
the
road
abv
and
tasty
ta
boot
solid
offering
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
yet
astringent
from
the
hop
addition
good
drinkability

d
great
like
i
said
its
my
first
dabble
with
the
style
and
im
diggin
it
d
this
beer
packs
a
punch
even
though
the
abv
is
not
really
high
its
just
a
big
full
flavored
beer
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
was
definitely
worth
the
8
99
for
the
sixer
it
does
an
excellent
job
of
showcasing
the
amarillo
hop
now
that
we
have
founders
in
minnesota
ill
be
drinking
this
for
quite
a
while
highly
recommended
i
will
say
this
reds
rye
to
my
palate
falls
off
fast
so
i
only
choose
it
if
i
know
its
really
fresh
smooth
and
sharp
i
like
the
carbonation
bite
it
has
very
smooth
and
silky
i
love
the
drinkability
too
for
a
cheaper
brew
this
is
an
amazing
deal
boy
am
i
glad
founders
made
it
to
minnesota
founders
reds
rye
is
a
beers
beer
with
deep
foamy
good
looks
and
a
flavor
that
balances
sweet
and
bitter
the
perfect
start
to
memorial
day
weekend
drinkability
one
of
the
most
strangely
alluring
beers
i
have
ever
had
wasnt
sure
i
liked
it
at
first
but
now
that
i
am
finishing
the
glass
i
am
crushed
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
style
not
myfavorite
style
but
this
was
a
good
one
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
had
this
poured
a
dark
clear
copper
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
fairly
bland
like
standard
copper
and
pine
hops
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
rye
it
tasted
like
strong
bitter
pine
hops
with
some
copper
hops
and
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
rye
spiciness
it
was
slightly
thick
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
surprisingly
a
hop
bomb
without
as
much
rye
as
expected
nice
flavor
albeit
very
bitter
and
not
as
unique
as
i
hoped
good
body
and
hides
alcohol
well
but
lasting
bitterness
makes
this
more
of
a
sipping
beer
id
like
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
hop
rod
and
rye
squared
on
its
own
i
thought
it
was
enjoyable
but
nothing
too
exciting
delicious
brew
goes
down
really
easy
this
may
be
the
best
rye
beer
ive
had
if
you
want
a
ryep
a
this
is
as
good
as
any
drinkability
solid
all
around
founders
again
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
id
love
to
have
more
but
it
is
a
bit
filling
excellent
offering
from
founders
im
in
love
with
their
stouts
and
wanted
to
see
how
they
performed
in
other
areas
very
nice
d
a
solid
tasty
offering
its
very
enjoyable
with
just
a
little
alcohol
warmth
adding
to
it
fortunately
i
can
pick
it
up
locally
now
and
look
forward
to
having
it
more
often
d
id
definitely
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
definitely
seek
this
one
out
well
worth
it
glad
that
founders
is
now
available
here
in
virginia
looking
forward
to
more
of
their
stuff
mediumbodied
easy
to
drink
easy
to
drink
well
worth
seeking
out
i
love
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
why
i
have
homebrewed
several
rye
beers
theres
just
something
about
the
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
that
keeps
me
coming
back
this
is
certainly
a
marvelous
professional
example
of
the
style
d
could
have
a
few
of
these
definitely
i
would
make
a
session
out
of
this
had
this
on
tap
at
the
charlotte
flying
saucer
two
days
ago
review
is
from
notes
taken
there
presented
in
a
pint
glass
with
appearence
of
hazy
dark
amber
color
it
had
an
amzing
aroma
with
a
combination
of
caramel
citrus
pines
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
excellent
too
with
great
balance
the
hops
were
really
well
balanced
with
hints
of
caramel
pretty
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
such
a
great
session
beer
another
good
one
from
founders
looking
forward
to
going
to
their
brewery
in
may
d
this
is
nice
and
drinkable
one
that
i
would
include
in
a
tasting
to
expand
ones
knowledge
of
what
is
out
there
i
love
this
one
in
the
realm
of
rye
beers
drinkability
definitely
high
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
because
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
really
nice
feel
without
being
overpowering
or
unbalanced
d
very
drinkable
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
nice
on
a
fall
day
with
the
nice
hops
and
the
warming
feeling
of
the
slightlyspicy
rye
overall
this
is
one
of
the
few
rye
beers
i
have
had
and
i
really
like
it
d
well
balanced
and
nicely
complex
a
smooth
bittersweet
brew
that
is
most
certainly
worth
a
try
amply
carbonated
feel
is
like
a
cracker
i
get
bread
but
the
co2
and
spice
and
feel
also
lend
substantial
crispness
creamy
towards
the
end
medium
body
very
drinkable
and
nice
thanks
ben
this
is
a
great
beer
im
jealous
that
you
can
get
this
d
really
easy
to
drink
good
hop
flavor
perfect
for
a
cool
spring
day
d
drinkability
is
high
quite
an
enjoyable
rye
ale
slightly
tart
in
the
flavor
a
good
amount
of
hops
and
balanced
recommended
a
good
beer
if
you
like
rye
ales
there
is
a
delicate
balance
of
hops
and
malt
to
blend
with
the
rye
no
one
flavor
is
overpowering
making
this
a
smooth
drinker
the
taste
is
strong
on
hops
strong
followed
by
the
rye
the
abv
is
6
8
but
its
hard
to
tell
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
is
good
but
the
carbonation
problem
is
what
makes
it
suffer
this
is
truly
a
beer
to
be
savored
founders
once
again
has
set
the
standard
pours
light
browndark
red
with
a
cream
colored
head
which
quickly
vanishes
leaving
behind
some
lacing
along
the
sides
nice
nose
of
hops
is
the
first
thing
i
get
not
too
much
just
right
some
citrusfloral
notes
follow
medium
in
body
and
perfect
carbonation
in
the
mouth
very
nice
i
enjoy
this
beer
looking
forward
to
another
trip
to
the
store
to
purchase
several
more
founders
brews
incredibly
good
beer
and
reds
rye
is
one
of
many
fine
examples
can
they
do
anything
wrong
the
spicy
rye
flavor
of
this
beer
works
like
a
charm
with
its
many
characteristics
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
this
isnt
founders
best
beer
by
any
means
but
its
damn
good
if
you
havent
tried
this
by
now
youre
missing
out
go
find
a
few
bottles
somewhat
slick
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
fluffs
it
up
a
bit
and
gives
an
overall
impression
of
creaminess
the
rye
bites
a
little
but
there
is
no
astingence
this
is
obviously
a
pretty
big
complex
and
bitter
beer
and
as
such
can
only
be
so
drinkable
founders
has
made
the
best
of
it
and
this
is
a
beer
which
is
very
inviting
if
a
little
overwhelming
another
awesome
beer
from
founders
a
real
treat
served
to
me
on
tap
at
founders
on
4809
the
liquid
is
a
very
dark
ruby
red
with
just
a
bit
of
a
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
floral
citrus
candied
pineapple
and
rye
notes
comprise
the
nose
as
for
the
taste
spicy
rye
definitely
takes
center
stage
in
this
batch
delicious
i
also
appreciate
roasted
characteristics
and
my
old
friend
mr
grapefruit
who
becomes
more
talkative
as
he
warms
up
to
you
do
you
see
what
i
did
there
the
citrus
hops
and
the
spicy
rye
make
a
great
combination
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
with
moderate
amounts
of
carbonation
the
flavors
are
some
of
the
most
powerful
ive
tasted
in
a
nonimperial
brew
however
despite
its
very
strong
flavors
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
indeed
amazing
even
worth
seeking
out
i
think
i
prefer
double
trouble
to
this
but
this
is
interesting
and
a
quality
beer
d
founders
just
produces
good
stuff
straight
up
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
no
reason
one
cant
have
several
of
these
red
rye
is
a
clear
copper
color
witha
bountiful
beige
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
it
has
a
pleasant
hoppy
aroma
and
also
some
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
it
has
lots
of
hop
flavors
and
some
spicyness
as
well
as
some
sweet
caramel
malt
there
is
also
an
orange
rind
flavor
in
it
it
has
a
full
bodied
taste
and
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
know
who
red
is
but
i
like
his
rye
ale
he
obviously
shares
my
affliction
for
hops
and
my
taste
for
well
crafted
well
rounded
beer
this
offering
is
deserving
of
its
reputation
and
then
some
if
only
the
people
of
grand
rapids
knew
how
lucky
they
were
and
im
lucky
too
after
two
trades
turned
up
infected
bottles
of
this
stuff
i
have
buckeyenation
to
thank
for
finally
hooking
me
up
with
a
good
sample
actually
a
great
sample
quite
pleasant
with
a
great
drinkability
owing
to
the
dryness
imparted
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
rye
with
the
rye
being
balanced
and
not
dominating
the
palate
very
good
overall
and
worthy
of
the
praise
ive
heard
of
it
an
amber
brew
cloudy
with
semisticky
offwhite
colored
head
a
big
grapefruit
aroma
with
floral
hops
and
a
little
fresh
fruit
in
the
background
a
big
bodied
brew
fruit
up
front
apple
and
pear
leads
to
a
chewy
center
the
finish
has
a
nicely
balanced
floral
and
pine
bitterness
which
lasts
along
with
a
little
spice
this
is
a
big
and
tasty
rye
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
future
outlook
after
being
disappointed
by
founders
centennial
ipa
yesterday
this
was
quite
the
redemption
ill
be
more
than
happy
to
have
this
again
all
the
great
complexities
of
this
beer
gives
it
subsequent
drinkability
brilliant
worth
seeking
out
i
think
i
prefer
double
trouble
to
this
but
this
is
interesting
and
a
quality
beer
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
from
what
ive
read
represents
the
style
well
with
its
grainy
rye
presence
my
personal
taste
is
whats
affecting
the
slightly
lower
rating
that
what
i
wanted
to
give
it
but
the
rye
flavor
may
be
more
of
an
acquired
taste
or
matter
of
personal
preference
but
as
mentioned
it
does
go
down
a
bit
sour
and
i
havent
ventured
into
that
realm
as
of
yet
so
here
is
where
im
leaving
it
ill
likely
try
this
beer
again
though
because
it
is
quite
tasty
and
even
a
bit
of
a
challenge
to
decipher
all
of
the
interesting
flavors
going
on
so
maybe
my
taste
preference
will
even
grow
into
its
favor
ontap
at
woodys
city
market
and
reviewed
from
notes
served
a
nice
crisp
red
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
citrus
hops
with
a
touch
of
rye
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
rye
malts
and
citrus
slightly
piney
hops
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
certainly
one
of
founders
best
yearround
beers
this
beer
looked
great
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
amber
color
but
upon
drinking
i
was
a
little
disappointed
it
tasted
and
had
a
mouthfeel
of
a
watered
down
ipa
with
some
of
the
hop
flavor
cut
out
definitely
not
for
someone
who
is
looking
for
a
good
hop
flavor
in
an
ipa
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
some
suspended
yeast
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
hops
a
general
sweetness
a
grainy
characteristic
that
im
assuming
is
rye
and
some
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
a
rye
beer
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
and
a
noticeable
dryness
associated
tastes
of
hops
up
front
some
ginger
very
slight
alcohol
then
strong
rye
and
finishes
with
a
rye
flavor
and
strong
dryness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
rye
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
delicious
the
rye
notes
add
to
what
seems
like
an
impressive
and
balanced
ipa
at
its
roots
which
is
how
it
should
be
the
rye
notes
are
delicious
and
add
depth
and
complexity
thats
unrivaled
possibly
one
of
my
favorites
that
ive
sampled
from
founders
a
great
looking
poor
dark
golden
red
with
a
head
that
leaves
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
you
think
you
are
getting
another
hop
bomb
of
an
ipa
not
that
this
would
be
a
horrible
event
by
any
means
but
then
you
taste
it
and
the
rye
comes
out
and
mingles
with
the
hops
and
it
is
fantastic
as
it
warms
the
rye
starts
to
dominate
and
the
beer
changes
a
bit
but
in
a
interesting
way
good
at
the
beginning
good
at
the
end
it
is
a
tremendous
brew
im
getting
a
little
tired
of
founders
just
showing
up
with
beer
after
beer
and
kicking
butt
and
taking
names
seriously
founders
let
some
other
breweries
get
a
shot
at
the
top
of
my
ratings
it
is
embarassing
i
feel
like
such
a
fan
boy
maybe
i
should
go
visit
my
buddy
karl
and
we
could
have
one
of
these
at
founders
would
probably
taste
much
different
had
a
strong
hop
scent
to
it
with
a
hint
of
the
rye
was
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
which
was
not
surprising
considering
the
head
on
this
one
overall
had
a
good
flavor
would
consider
trying
one
again
overall
a
must
try
for
sure
if
you
were
going
to
have
just
one
beer
this
would
be
a
great
choice
very
hoppy
spicy
would
overwhelm
any
lighter
beers
following
it
notes
why
more
brewers
dont
use
rye
malt
in
their
beers
ill
never
know
i
just
love
that
spicy
element
that
this
unique
brewing
grain
brings
to
the
table
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
is
just
a
smidgeon
past
the
optimal
drinking
age
and
very
wellcrafted
beer

but
the
impression
lives
on

though
d
the

up
on
you
with
this
one
i
have
bought
this
beer
for
years
and
am
just
reviewing
it
now
because
it
manages
to
disappear
out
of
my
fridge
before
i
even
realize
it

color
with

thick
and
puffy
white
head
leaves
layers
along
the
glass
as
the
session
goes
by
malty
smell
with
caramel
layers
and
a
nice
hoppy
scent
the
taste
is
very
malty
as
well
with
great
balance
of
they
rye
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
not
really
existent
and
makes
for
a
smooth
drink
had
this
on
tap
at
the
founders
brewpub
it
had
a
bright
amber
red
body
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
aroma
is
very
hoppy
and

with

character
the
hop
aromas
are
very
citrusy
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
with
strong
citrus
notes
and
rye
spiciness
the
rye
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
i
would
have
guessed
from
the
aroma
but
the
hop
flavor
is
almost
so
intense
that
it
creates
a
muddled
taste

pretty
good
beer

around

still

a

of
these
would
go
down

and
leave
the
drinker
with
a
thirst
for

not

the
palate
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
will
take
any
palate
for

ride
the
aroma
and
the
taste
do
not

completely
but
that
adds
to
the
interesting
nature
of
the
brew
cheers
on
tap
at
three
floyds
brewpub
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
looking
tan
head
that
slowy
faded
away
some
thick
chunky
lacing
was
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
made
up
of
sweet
caramel
along
with
some
strong
citrus
hop
notes
a
touch
of
rye
malt
was
also
present
the
flavor
was
very
robust
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
showing
up
right
away
then
finishing
with
a
lasting
piney
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fullbodied
with
minimal
carbonation
and
some
light
warming
alcohol
very
tasty
i
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
of
this
superb
brew
pour
slowly
or
else
be
prepared
to
wait
a
while
for
the
head
to
dissipate
pours
a
very
dark
amber
red
with
a
great
rich
forever
frothy
very
offwhite
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
lacing
is
also
heavy
and
has
excellent
retention
a
very
dark
resin
slips
out
of
the
bottle
if
held
long
enough
one
of
the
best
looking
brews
i
have
had
honestly
smell
is
of
strong
hops
with
a
very
sweet
citrus
twang
very
tempting
this
is
an
excellent
full
bodied
complex
brew
rye
malt
is
powerful
so
are
the
hopps
there
is
citrus
here
and
something
else
that
i
cant
pinpoint
within
the
hopps
that
make
this
hop
heavy
beer
extremely
well
balanced
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
abv
of
6
8
is
easily
disguised
by
the
complex
flavors
this
is
a
home
run
by
founders
a
must
try
for
all
that
appreciate
great
a
great
brew
this
bottle
of
reds
rye
looks
beautiful
when
poured
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
of
foam
with
sugarspun
lace
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
it
is
indeed
a
red
ale
with
a
wonderful
candied
orange
hop
nose
at
least
at
first
mixed
a
touch
of
pine
later
on
this
beer
starts
smelling
like
a
bit
like
a
wood
shop
think
sawdust
it
is
very
mellow
at
first
before
the
caramel
malt
flavors
get
coated
with
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
roastiness
the
bitterness
is
very
assertive
and
almost
overcomes
the
palate
crowding
out
the
other
flavors
i
would
call
this
a
rye
ipa
for
sure
and
one
that
is
all
about
the
hops
i
couldnt
detect
the
flavor
of
rye
at
first
too
much
hop
flavor
got
in
the
way
but
as
this
ale
warmed
up
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
definite
rye
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
this
actually
makes
the
beer
dangerously
quaffable
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
almost
menacingly
bitter
hoppy
red
rye
ale
d
a
great
beer
by
founders
incredibly
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
i
just
wish
that
they
distributed
to
my
area
so
it
wouldnt
be
such
a
hassle
to
obtain
this
great
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
notch
on
label
but
no
clear
indication
of
what
it
means
i
got
in
a
trade
so
no
idea
on
age
of
beer
was
a
cloudy
reddish
orange
color
it
had
a
good
light
beige
head
that
stuck
around
as
a
thin
film
with
a
little
lacing
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
some
hops
but
not
as
much
as
i
read
in
other
reviews
could
be
freshness
issue
the
taste
was
hoppy
which
was
odd
since
not
much
hop
aroma
didnt
really
like
it
after
the
1st
couple
drinks
but
then
it
hit
its
stride
and
grew
on
me
need
to
try
again
when
i
know
its
fresh
but
i
could
see
drinking
this
one
every
once
in
a
while
if
avail
here
which
its
not
overall
a
good
beer
that
ill
try
again
but
for
now
its
a
once
a
year
beer
when
i
go
home
to
indy
to
see
the
folks

rb
t
o
drinkability
awesome
this
is
the
second
rye
beer
i
have
experienced
and
it
is
amazing
i
could
drink
this
anyday
in
every
season
i
wonder
what
the
percentage
of
rye
used
in
the
mash
was
overall
awesome
edit
after
drinking
some
more
i
have
to
say
this
is
best
fresh
still
excellent
but
the
flavors
are
definitely
a
bit
more
muted
than
fresh
since
i
never
reviewed
this
here
fresh
the
numbers
are
overall
aged
about
12
a
year
the
overall
would
probably
be
about
a

this
one

for
a
bottle
pours
nice

ale
and
wow
what
a
great
smell
of
fresh
rye
right
away
great
balance
do
not
notice
the
hops
or
alcohol
not
for
novices
to
enjoy
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
quintessential
rye
beer
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
rye
malts
its
sweet
with
a
peppery
rye
aroma
as
well
as
some
mild
hop
scents
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
spicey
flavor
that
boasts
of
hops
and
rye
as
well
as
some
burnt
toffee
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
dry
bitter
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
got
a
unique
flavor
that
i
really
enjoy
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
more
like
an
ipa
update
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
encountered
and
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
sublime
this
is
so
near
perfect
id
like
to
know
what
perfect
is
terrific
and
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
could
do
two
in
a
night
probably
not
back
to
back
though
this
is
a
predominately
dry
beer
while
the
malt
is
present
there
is
absolutely
no
sweetness
the
hop
bitterness
quickly
takes
over
and
lasts
long
after
the
swallow
the
body
is
wonderfully
full
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
if
i
can
say
one
thing
about
founders
they
do
hops
right
i
love
this
beer
appearance
is
a
nice
deep
redamber
hue
it
is
a
red
ale
with
a
nice
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
enough
for
me
to
know
that
this
beer
was
going
to
taste
good
i
am
guessing
that
it
was
dryhopped
as
it
has
that
nice
floral
piney
hop
aroma
that
i
crave
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
good
malt
backbone
to
follow
up
the
hoppiness
my
taste
buds
are
not
discerning
enough
to
tell
what
the
rye
was
doing
here
but
an
excellent
beer
none
the
less
d
overall
a
winner
one
id
love
to
have
again
superbly
balanced
nice
flavors
and
enticing
aroma
definitely
recommended
drank
right
at
founders
brewery
on
a
beautiful
sunny
day
the
pour
on
this
is
great
with
compact
head
on
top
of
an
amazing
ruby
red
bodyi
dont
think
that
i
have
seen
many
beers
like
this
nice
hoppy
smell
but
not
too
overpowering
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
maybe
too
there
isnt
too
much
hoppiness
in
the
taste
but
more
of
a
malty
taste
but
all
very
clean
and
smooth
unfortunately
i
cant
comment
too
much
more
on
this
beer
as
i
dont
drink
alot
of
rye
beers
so
there
may
or
may
not
be
some
of
that
in
there
too
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
though
and
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
lots
of
bitter
aromatic
hops
start
to
finish
with
a
toasty
dry
tangy
malt
imo
this
is
too
much
a
super
hoppy
ipa
made
with
rye
i
would
like
to
enjoy
the
rye
more
with
perhaps
less
of
a
hopslam
as
an
ipa
the
malt
is
too
dry
nevertheless
this
is
enjoyable
to
drink
shows
off
a
beautiful
murky
burnt
amber
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
dies
down
to
a
nice
layer
that
stays
throughout
stickiness
is
crazy
good
all
over
the
glass
for
entire
tasting
almost
a
crystal
like
lacing
that
glistens
smell
is
of
a
clean
rye
but
not
overpowering
at
all
a
very
nice
citrusgrapefruit
hop
blast
as
well
mild
coffee
malt
seems
to
balance
this
one
out
quite
well
taste
was
quite
a
surprise
so
much
smoother
than
i
had
anticipated
the
powerful
hop
odor
doesnt
dominate
the
taste
at
all
and
i
love
it
but
the
citrus
is
still
there
definite
malt
towards
the
end
so
balanced
drinkability
is
pretty
high
because
its
so
smooth
and
clean
i
have
yet
to
taste
a
beer
like
this
and
i
am
so
glad
i
have
definitely
seek
this
one
out
d
really
great
drinking
beer
with
a
fair
alcohol
content
so
awesome
drinkabilitysessionability
definitely
right
on
for
its
rating
this
is
the
most
thirst
quenching
beer
i
think
i
have
ever
had
i
was
very
excited
to
see
this
one
available
in
pa
deep
burgandy
orange
color
with
a
sticky
off
white
head
rings
of
lace
are
left
behind
as
you
drink
it
smell
is
not
what
i
expected
but
very
nice
tons
of
hops
some
fruity
traces
but
i
get
more
of
an
earthy
tone
than
anything
taste
is
all
bitterness
up
front
but
it
somehow
manages
to
finish
clean
im
not
sure
where
the
rye
comes
in
on
this
one
but
i
really
dont
care
the
hop
oils
are
noticable
in
the
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
especially
at
the
price
i
got
it
for
a
well
crafted
brew
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
will
pick
this
one
up
whenever
i
see
it
wow
the
best
rye
i
have
ever
come
across
deep
hazy
amber
reddish
brown
i
normally
dont
really
care
about
the
head
on
a
beer
but
the
head
on
this
is
this
offwhite
craggy
monstrosity
that
does
not
want
to
go
away
the
lacing
is
like
a
wall
on
the
glass
there
honestly
was
a
ring
of
head
substructurea
suspended
ring
of
head
an
inch
below
the
water
line
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
a
ring
of
head
inside
the
fucking
beer
an
inch
down
from
the
top
wtf
nutty
roastyspicy
citric
dark
fruit
bread
in
the
nose
light
initial
malt
sweetness
is
quickly
taken
over
by
supporting
abundant
hop
bitterness
and
roastedspicy
malt
flavors
hops
are
pronounced
long
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
complex
enough
to
leave
you
wanting
more
and
not
too
high
of
an
abv
pours
a
gorgeous
almost
luxurious
ruby
red
color
topped
with
plentiful
tight
meringue
like
head
aroma
is
filled
with
a
mass
of
hops
centennial
and
chinook
perhaps
much
like
a
bigfoot
or
ruffian
telling
me
this
will
be
a
delicious
beer
as
the
hops
or
pushed
aside
very
difficult
im
able
to
smell
some
tropical
fruits
like
mango
kiwi
with
a
little
bit
of
faint
baking
spice
coming
through
perhaps
a
sign
of
the
rye
the
hops
are
a
lot
more
subdued
in
the
taste
with
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfull
of
malt
with
a
very
dry
finish
im
not
too
familiar
with
rye
beers
but
im
curious
is
the
very
dry
finish
is
characteristic
as
its
a
detraction
for
me
im
looking
for
a
little
sweetness
to
balance
but
that
is
my
only
complaint
the
flavor
is
very
complex
bringing
waves
of
hops
and
spice
reminiscent
of
rye
bread
sans
caraway
unfortunately
that
dryness
will
bring
down
my
drinkability
score
a
bit
the
best
rye
beer
ive
had
to
date
and
again
probably
the
most
impressive
beer
ive
had
in
recent
memory
its
perfectly
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
medium
bodied
clean
dry
finish
very
drinkable
though
a
bit
on
the
bitter
finish
side
taste
is
burned
like
black
malt
and
now
the
bitterness
is
able
to
overpower
this
burned
taste
the
rye
is
there
and
is
a
little
oily
and
husky
actually
the
bitterness
is
very
much
upfront
and
has
a
citric
hoppy
taste
that
is
also
piny
and
oily
i
never
tasted
a
beer
with
amarillo
hops
and
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
typical
us
hop
for
me
this
beer
is
out
of
balance
and
too
bitter
my
mouth
gets
numbed
after
a
few
sips
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
lingering
bitter
overall
a
ballsy
amber
with
lots
of
hops
flavoring
thanks
for
throwing
this
in
as
a
great
extra
brandoman63
this
rye
ale
pours
a
clear
amberred
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
the
head
diminished
to
a
thin
skim
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
highly
hoppy
and
high
citrus
with
a
little
bit
of
fruity
and
sweet
the
taste
is
initially
rather
bitter
pleasantly
so
with
a
high
citrus
hop
flavor
toward
the
swallow
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
emerges
and
the
finish
is
then
dominated
by
a
lingering
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
crisp
but
i
cant
really
pick
out
the
rye
between
the
immense
hop
presence
and
seemingly
fair
amount
of
crystal
malt
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
i
would
put
it
into
the
ipa
realm
similar
in
some
ways
to
sn
celebration
ale
the
aroma
and
hop
flavor
are
my
favorite
very
fresh
and
inviting
the
color
of
the
beer
is
also
very
nice
ill
buy
this
one
again
deep
ruby
colored
into
a
goblet
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
head
continuous
rising
bead
all
the
way
through
and
some
lacing
left
behind
mostly
floral
hoppiness
maybe
a
grapefruity
hop
smell
somewhere
in
the
back
but
mild
smells
alot
to
me
like
bells
two
hearted
floral
notes
also
in
the
taste
with
a
very
bitter
hop
bite
bitterness
felt
throughout
entire
mouth
possibly
one
of
the
most
bitter
hoppy
beers
ive
ever
had
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
felt
on
tongue
drinkability
was
only
affected
for
me
by
the
huge
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
an
excellent
offering
from
founders
that
i
may
have
to
try
again
since
founders
is
finally
allowed
in
pennsylvania
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
darkish
red
with
only
a
little
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
long
the
smell
is
nice
ripe
hops
and
some
grain
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
strongly
hoppish
with
a
sweet
grain
you
can
taste
the
oils
and
embers
of
the
hops
and
it
is
very
pleasant
the
only
downside
is
that
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
too
strong
too
much
of
a
bite
and
the
middle
and
end
arent
that
distinguishable
what
you
taste
on
the
front
end
is
what
is
there
at
the
end
which
makes
it
anything
but
complex
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
very
enjoyable
though
lchaim
founders
in
pa
this
will
be
great
though
i
prefer
the
black
rye
i
look
forward
to
picking
up
some
of
it
and
this
beer
as
well
whenever
im
out
shopping
ovearall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
not
sure
what
distinguishes
it
from
most
ipas
though
the
beer
poured
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
massive
and
i
mean
massive
thick
foamy
head
into
my
pint
glass
the
head
was
so
thick
and
foamy
that
it
reminded
me
of
the
head
on
a
root
beer
float
after
giving
the
head
some
time
to
subside
i
took
a
wiff
and
the
nose
was
pleasingly
hoppy
the
taste
was
of
rye
and
malts
with
a
good
peppery
taste
on
the
tongue
very
interesting
beer

slightly
cloudy

nice

i
think
my
first
d
incredibly
refreshing
a
perfect
anytime
of
the
year
beer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
yellowish
head
a
nice
looking
beer
its
head
is
a
bit
frothy
and
clingy
and
tends
to
fade
a
bit
this
beer
carries
a
hefty
amarillo
hop
aroma
that
really
pulls
through
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
not
as
balanced
as
advertised
it
is
very
good
and
very
drinkable
but
certianly
balanced
toward
the
bitter
quite
well
i
was
hoping
for
the
belgian
crystal
malt
to
shine
thorugh
a
bit
more
as
the
malt
character
is
rather
muted
aside
from
that
it
has
the
ability
to
encourage
the
next
quaff
the
rye
does
lend
a
spicy
character
that
blends
well
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
body
of
the
beer
is
moderate
to
low
quite
drinkable

for
the

the

dont

the
flavor
if
you
like
hops
and
are
intrigued
about
how
a
bit
of

spiciness
adds
to
it
you
cant
do
much
better
few
beers
more
tasty
have
ever
crossed
my
lips
very
drinkable
but
if
i
havent
said
it
enough
wasnt
meant
to
be
cold
i
reccomend
storing
it
at
room
temp
and
putting
in
the
fridge
for
10
minutes
before
drinking
its
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
gone
before
you
know
it
pours
a
dark
hazy
reddish
color
small
1
finger
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
probably
due
to
an
unusually
slow

i
drink

i
can
smell
taste

the
way
on
this
one
impressive

bodied

a
great
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
and
a
nice
tart

the
balance
is
superb
in
this
brew
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
great
overall
exceptionally
smooth
i
could
definetely
have
a
few
of
these
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
really
enjoyed
the
quick
transition
on
the
palate
from
this
one
as
it
made
it
for
a
quite
interesting
and
ejoyable
beer
d
a
nice
well
made
beer
i
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
if
i
ever
found
this
again
id
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
sixer
dit
is
good
i
dont
think
i
would
hunt
for
one
but
if
i
saw
it
i
would
pick
a
couple
up
overall
a
fantastic
brew
for
anyone
who
likes
hops
this
beer
is
a
musttaste
i
keep
a
couple
of
these
on
hand
at
all
times
drinkability
goes
down
fairly
nice
i
honestly
drank
it
faster
then
i
thought
i
would
the
fact
that
i
am
unsure
of
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
really
indicates
to
me
that
i
should
try
it
again
later
overall
thanks
go
out
to
ggaughan
for
this
great
beer
i
really
like
it
and
would
definately
drink
it
again
if
i
ever
get
the
chance

its

to

recommend
picking
up

you
have

i
expected

were
dominated
by
the
sweet
hops
flavors
featured
mainly
piny

these
aspects
of
the
beer
were
definitely
good

the
beer
seemed
more

a

the
tastes

good
beer
from

id
reach
for
it
again
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
cheers
d
the
only
thing
hurting
this
drinkability
is
the
dryness
of
the
beer
and
the
amount
you
want
to
savor
the
awesome
beverage
highly
recommended
just
be
patient
with
the
pour
if
you
get
a
foamy
batch
d
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
3
or
4
at
a
time
one
of
my
favorite
rye
beers
seek
it
out
and
enjoy
it
cheers
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a

glass
beer
is
a
rubyamber
color
with
an
offwhite
bubbly
head
smell
is
dominated
by
spicy
hops
taste
boasts
the
same
spicy
hops
with
a
smooth
finish
alcohol
is
hidden
well
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
consistency
and
not
very
much
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
is
thus
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
beer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
my
first
founders
beer
and
i
think
ill
have
to
try
many
more
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
offering
it
does
remind
one
of
hop
rod
rye
a
bit
but
the
hops
are
far
more
subdued
here
to
let
the
rye
shine
through
this
brew
conveys
a
sense
of
richness
but
with
some
conservatism
a
fine
job
by
founders
a
good
smooth
tasty
beer
d
this
is
a
very
original
beer
a
bit
too
rich
for
a
six
pack
in
one
evening
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
indeed
a
highly
recommended
elixir
for
those
willing
to
try
something
different
drinkable
maybe
as
can
be
i
have
had
a
dance
or
two
with
more
drinkable
dipas
cheers
thanks
to
norkyorksammy
for
the
trade
drinkability
this
is
excellent
truly
original
inspired
and
its
entirely
sessionable
this
is
yet
another
beer
that
just
gets
better
and
better
with
each
sitdown
with
it
the
first
few
bottles
poured
with
a
really
huge
head
to
the
point
where
i
had
to
wai
ten
minutes
before
i
could
drink
the
red
liquid
at
the
bottom
after
i
switched
glasses
it
poured
much
more
smoothly
with
less
head
and
a
pleasing
clear
red
lots
of
sediment
lingered
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
which
might
turn
off
some
people
but
didnt
seem
to
play
a
huge
part
in
the
overall
experience
the
first
whiffs
were
of
overwhelming
cocoa
and
caramel
which
was
completely
the
opposite
of
what
i
was
expecting
with
some
warming
and
spinning
i
noticed
a
much
more
bitter
smell
almost
as
if
the
initial
sweetness
was
never
really
there
taste
was
divine
with
some
crisp
green
apple
tastes
at
the
beginning
and
some
strong
hops
and
rye
towards
the
end
leaving
a
bitter
taste
on
the
palate
the
hoprye
marriage
gave
it
a
really
nice
spicyness
as
well
body
was
medium
and
gained
complexity
as
it
swishes
around
in
the
mouth
as
with
nearly
all
founders
beers
theres
a
near
perfect
balance
that
has
to
be
experienced
to
truly
understand
drinkability
i
am
pouring
another
one
right
now
in
the
middle
of
this
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
in
a
previous
review
of
the
black
rye
i
asked
myself
which
one
i
liked
better
now
i
have
to
say
that
this
one
gets
my
vote
as
the
better
of
the
two
though
the
black
rye
is
matvelous
as
well
this
is
another
example
of
why
imo
founders
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
united
states
now
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
some
breakfast
stout
during
its
always
brief
stint
on
liquor
store
shelves
in
this
state

i
did
appreciated
this
beer
i
would
have
prefer
less

and
a
bit
more
rye
drinkability
very
good
balance
between
sharpness
from
rye
maltiness
from
darker
grains
and
generous
hopping
highly
recommended
for
hop
heads
and
those
who
like
maltiness
that
finishes
dry
rather
than
cloying
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
damn
day
very
disappointed
that
my
first
experience
of
this
beer
was
a
contaminated
bottle
it
has
definitely
been
plagued
by
the
grand
funk
of
death
many
thanks
go
out
to
trbeer
for
the
opportunity
to
have
this
delicious
libation
overall
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
this
was
an
exceptional
beer
and
lived
up
to
the
hype
an
excellent
choice
it
is
so
hard
to
find
a
rye
beer
on
the
west
coast
thank

for

thanks
dave
drinkability
as
i
alluded
to
in
the

has
everything
i
would
want
in
a
session
beer
lots
of
flavor
great
balance
and
a
mouth
feel
that
is
not
too
heavy

big
thanks
to
kyle
for
bringing
these
down
to
me
on
a
recent
trip
after
tasting
two
beers
from
founders
i
need
to
have
more
great
beer
and
incredibly
well
made
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
them
founders
start
shipping
to
va
i
later
noticed
that
this
is
my
100th
review
and
what
a
damn
fine
brew
to
have
on
such
a
momentous
occasion
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
fault
with
this
beer
it
is
even
a
good
value
for
craft
beer
i
will
be
drinking
this
for
as
long
as
theyre
making
it
i
cant
think
of
a
beer
id
recommend
more
highly
highly
recommended
beer
recommended
thanks
to
nucular
george
for
the
sample
ss
d
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
low
enough
abv
to
make
a
nice
session
some
nuts
and
cheese
make
a
great
pairing
this
is
one
tasty
beer
and
a
must
try
for
those
who
like
things
with
rye
like
beer
whiskey
or
bread
would
make
a
great
session
brew
on
a
cooler
night
when
a
bigger
brew
is
needed
would
also
make
a
great
crossover
brew
for
someone
who
likes
rye
and
can
handle
a
little
hops
ill
be
drinking
this
one
again
soon
pours
from
the
bottle
a
cloudy
opaque
reddish
orange
hue
under
a
huge
thick
and
frothy
beige
head
superb
head
retention
throughout
with
a
trail
of
thick
lacing
pleasant
moderate
aromas
of
pine
needles
caramel
lemon
rind
spices
and
rye
toast
meld
together
nicely
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
spritzy
carbonation
initial
flavor
seems
dominated
by
the
malts
revealing
a
subdued
caramel
toffee
sweetness
this
quickly
transcends
into
a
hefty
hop
and
rye
flavor
profile
showing
off
assertive
notes
of
grapefruit
pine
rye
seeds
and
spicy
black
pepper
finish
is
a
mouthpuckering
combination
of
a
chalkylike
mineral
dryness
and
hoppy
bitterness
which
hangs
on
nicely
in
the
end
a
great
balance
of
the
malts
hops
and
rye
to
create
a
pleasurable
unique
style
this
began
with
a
good
mediumtan
head
but
it
didnt
last
and
became
just
a
light
coating
on
top
of
the
beer
the
color
was
a
reddishorangish
color
with
a
slight
cloudiness
the
nose
was
both
hoppy
and
spicy
like
pepper
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
thick
with
a
huge
mix
of
flavors
on
the
tongue
malty
sweetness
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
peppery
bite
all
on
the
palate
the
finish
had
that
characteristic
bite
of
rye
making
it
the
lingering
prevalent
taste
id
drink
this
on
a
regular
and
continuing
basis
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
a
new
beer
to
add
to
my
list
of
favorites
very
nice
this
rye
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
red
coppery
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
persisted
and
coated
the
glass
the
smell
was
rich
spicy
rye
goodness
with
other
malt
and
hops
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
was
bitter
hops
combined
with
rye
malt
in
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
dry
but
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
it
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
hops
built
to
the
finish
and
the
malt
lingered
on
the
palate
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
nice
rye
ipa
thanks
to
warriorsoul
for
this
one
the
drinkability
is
high
excellent
balance
is
flawless
o
how
i
wish
i
could
but
this
here
thank
you
shbobdb

great
color
substantial
head
on
pour
beautiful
appearance
taste
was
disappointing
the
bottle
i
obtained
had
a
very
distinct
rye
taste
and
smell
if
you
like
rye
this
ones
for
you
it
comes
as
advertised
its
not
called
reds
rye
for
nothing
i
was
hoping
for
some
sweet
undertones
maybe
a
little
burnt
sugar
to
offset
the
rye
but
not
to
be
nice
well
rounded
beer
hops
may
be
a
bit
overbearing
thus
minimizing
the
rye
character
but
i
like
hops
so
its
no
big
deal
d
another
winner
from
founders
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
will
have
this
again
this
beer
is
a
solid
whole
package
kinda
beer
and
nicely
crafted
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
represented
well
malts
hops
and
rye
character
reminds
me
of
the
bear
republic
hop
rod
rye
which
is
another
personal
favorite
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
founders
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
fullflavored
yet
smooth
poured
with
a
head
massive
enough
to
be
called
gigantic
body
is
crimson
orange
nose
is
sharp
pine
mingled
with
orange
and
grapefruit
taste
starts
with
pine
moves
to
grapefruit
then
segues
into
caramel
very
nice
mouth
is
big
and
burly
if
i
could
get
this
without
trading
i
would
certainly
do
so
a
winner
of
a
beer
this
is
another
great
beer
from
founders
real
nice
single
bottle
purchased
at
woodmans
in
madison
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
but
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
and
welldesigned
beer
not
a
session
in
my
book
but
a
nice
beer
to
things
up
the
rye
character
was
deftly
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
of
a
an
amber
ale
a
nice
bit
of
spicy
punch
to
the
hops
with
underlying
malt
sweetness
that
balanced
well
the
rubyred
color
is
certainly
eyecatching
and
the
beer
overall
grabbed
my
attention
right
away
perhaps
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
thanks
for
picking
this
up
eric

up
with

color
is
a
deep
maroondark
brown
with
faint
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
highly
hopped
grapefruit
and
citrus
some
piney
notes
but
a
lot
of
organic
dry
and
musty
grains
as
well
the
flavor
is
somewhat
like
a
smooth
barleywine
very
dry
with
dark
fruity
base
and
nicely
hopped
there
is
however
a
definite
rye
flavor
in
the
back
of
this
one
that
gives
it
a
character
all
its
own
a
distinct
flavor
like
i
have
had
it
before
but
i
have
not
had
it
before
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
well
carbonated
overall
a
damn
drinkable
brew
try
one
on
tap
if
you
can
what
a
beautiful
beer
this
pours
out
rusty
orangetinged
copper
appearance
with
a
buttery
offwhite
head
that
just
never
fades
strong
hops
on
the
nose
with
some
warm
peach
fuzz
that
mellows
the
hop
burn
the
piney
hops
and
rye
make
this
a
deliciously
bitter
brew
however
the
estery
fruit
characteristics
make
it
sweet
and
smooth
going
down
im
gonna
polish
off
this
sixer
without
a
problem
and
i
might
even
go
get
another
before
the
night
is
through
pick
this
up
you
wont
be
dissapointed
color
is
as
expected

from
a
fresh
bottle
obtained
in
a
trade
ive
also
had
this
one
on
tap
several
times
in
boston
and
in
grand
rapids
and
it
doesnt
dissapoint
this
one
is
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
dishwater
coloured
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
aromas
are
all
fresh
probably
the
best
red
ive
had
yet
tough
to
come
by
though
as
we
dont
get
founders
here
in
rochester
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
it

when
all
is
said
in
done
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
but
citric
all
the
way
medium
bodied
but
this
damn
combo
of
fruity
hops
and
toasted
malt
just
does
not
work
two
great
flavors
that
just
dont
belong
together
good
beer
softer
and
a
bit
grainier
with
the
rye
pours

the
color
of
a
penny
thats
aged
a
bit
dark
copper
with
some
ruddy
highlights
head
rises
a
bit
to
orangey
peaks
and
then
disappears
aroma
is
invitingly
hoppy
with
slight
nuances
of
understated
sweet
fruits
mixed
in
with
malty
sweetness
flavor
is
initially
hoppy
with
some
bitter
pine
and
tangy
grapefruit
hints

crisp
with
a
lingering
aftertaste

tingly
grapefruit
another
tasty
beer
sent
my
way
from
buckeyenation
pours
from
the
bottle
a
vibrant
yet
hazy
reddish
amber
hops
emanate
in
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
sweet
biscuity
malt
very
well
balanced
malty
and
dry
initially
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
mildly
bitter
hoppy
finish
cracker
like
biscuit
flavors
add
to
the
dry
mouthfeel
and
herbal
seedy
rye
bread
is
detectable
as
well
one
of
the
few
rye
beers
ive
had
that
balances
the
rye
malt
and
hops
so
nicely
sweet

twang
dry

finish
oh
yeah
founders
does
it
again
please
please
pleeease
start
distributing
in
pa
every
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
from
this
fine
brewery
is
stellar
palate
big
flavor
but
with
a
very
nice
dry
quality
a
bit
of
a
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
its
velvety
and
mouthfilling
and
the
flavors
rouse
when
you
swish
it
around
i
taste
cedar
mineral
brandy
and
maybe
a
hint
of
sherry
sweetness
there
is
just
the
faintest
note
of
raisins
or
prunes
lurking
in
the
long
finish
pours
an
attractive
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
finger
of
khaki
head
and
some
lacing
smell
is
quite
floral
and
hoppy
some
bitter
rye
and
light
fruit
tastes
like
a
sweet
bitter
ipa
mixed
with
a
scotch
ale
floral
hops
up
front
some
sweet
malt
and
citrus
rounding
it
out
mouthfeel
is
rich
like
dirty
bastard
which
this
also
reminds
me
of
this
was
pretty
tasty
not
as
much
rye
as
i
would
have
guessed
which
was
nice
cuz
i
really
dont
like
rye
so
much
a
hoppy
sweet
tasty
brew
founders
you
never
disappoint
me
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brick
with
an
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
tall
ring
surrounded
by
lace
smell
is
malty
rye
with
hop
notes
very
inviting
the
taste
is
cracked
black
pepper
citric
acid
and
fizzy
carbonation
the
rye
shines
through
along
with
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
at
times
feels
full
very
nice
for
either
a
red
ale
or
a
rye
beer
easy
to
drink
pushing
7
abv
id
recommend
pairing
this
with
some
munchies
like
a
buttery
cheese
to
keep
it
all
in
perspective
reds
rye
and
black
rye
are
nothing
like
each
other
yet
another
solid
offering
from
founders
michigan
breweries
rule
moderate
body
very
pleasurable
with
delicate
and
almost
refreshing
carbonation
not
a
session
brew
too
big
but
very
tasty
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
overall
what
can
i
say
i
like
it
a
lot
very
tasty
brew
a
lot
like
an
apa
but
with
a
delicious
spicy
rye
kick
easy
session
brew
i
received
this
in
a
trade
and
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
drinkability
very
drinkable
indeed
im
going
to
plug
this
one
to
my
friends
ill
most
likely
pick
this
one
up
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
my
first
rye
beer
and
i
like
this
style
yet
another
fine
offering
from
the
folks
at
founders
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
one
of
their
brews
keep
up
the
great
work
this
is
my
first
beer
from
founders
and
im
quite
impressed
a
pretty
serious
beer
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
at
this
point
of
the
night
its
disguising
itself
as
something
different
i
really
dig
this
beer
characteristics
abound
in
this
one
get
it
if
you
can
beautiful
amber
red
a
bit
hazy
with
a
very
nice
head
that
maintains
til
the
end
leaving
clumps
all
along
the
way
smells
of
massive
hops
and
ive
baked
a
few
rye
loaves
in
the
past
definitely
smells
of
rye
up
front
are
bready
malts
on
the
tongue
and
then
citrusy
hops
intermingle
with
the
rye
all
across
the
palate
the
rye
flavor
is
quite
pronounced
and
excellent
very
bready
too
just
like
a
big
hunk
of
rye
no
caraway
seeds
very
very
nice
ends
very
dry
with
hops
and
spiciness
slowly
fading
away
i
love
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
with
low
to
moderate
carbonation
this
is
highly
drinkable
my
only
real
knock
on
this
beer
is
my
main
knock
with
many
of
these
lighter
summer
offerings
lack
of
depth
but
the
beer
is
good
for
what
it
is
no
complaints
a
quality
summer
style
quaffer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
odd
very
thick
chewy
and
grainy
but
still
seems
to
be
plenty
light
and
refreshing
i
only
wish
this
beer
were
available
here
in
iowa
because
i
would
drink
the
crap
out
of
it
all
american
hops
pungant
and
resiny
clear
copperred
with
tan
head
and
fab
lacing
big
hop
flavor
with
rye
spicyness
caramel
and
good
bitterness
quite
dry
and
refreshing
my
first
founders
beer
every
pretty
happy
so
far
i
downed
three
bottles
of
this
stuff
with
ease
this
beer
is
fantastic
founders
needs
to
find
a
way
into
the
nebraska
market
pints
yes
s
at
come
back
inn
in
madison
wi
at
the
pregreat
taste
founders
party
taste
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
that
characteristic
rye
bite
this
is
the
best
commercial
example
of
a
highlyhopped
rye
beer
ive
had
wonderful
mixture
of
sweet
malts
slightly
spicy
and
stalky
rye
and
the
perfect
blend
of
juicy
hops
to
dry
things
out
nicely
in
the
end
excellent
beer
pours
a
beautiful
blood
red
color
with
a
creamy
reddishwhite
head
the
aroma
is
huge
it
hits
you
the
second
you
open
the
bottle
and
never
leaves
citric
hops
and
complex
malt
tones
battle
it
out
to
perfection
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
its
almost
like
a
good
ipa
but
with
rye
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
awesome
brew
i
can
not
conceive
how
this
beer
could
be
made
any
better
than
it
already
is
drinkability
on
this
great
beer
is
great
this
one
is
going
to
have
some
staying
power
in
my
fridge
i
love
rye
beers
so
unique
i
always
see
good
reviews
of
this
on
here
and
ive
never
been
able
to
find
it
until
last
night
on
the
bottle
list
at
the
sunset
grill
and
tap
in
allston
nice
amber
color
murkier
than
average
with
a
huge
bright
white
rocky
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
were
talkin
a
ring
after
every
sip
here
i
like
it
spicy
hops
spicy
rye
smell
taste
is
just
perfect
with
the
rye
like
a
nice
well
balanced
though
hoppy
red
ale
but
with
the
added
complexity
of
rye
i
cant
get
enough
of
that
rye
taste
in
beers
and
i
really
think
every
brewery
should
release
a
beer
in
this
classic
style
there
really
arent
that
many
that
i
can
think
of
it
really
adds
a
lot
though
its
so
simple
to
what
would
otherwise
be
your
average
ale
if
you
havent
had
a
beer
brewed
with
rye
before
or
you
havent
had
this
particular
beer
i
definately
urge
you
to
go
seek
it
out
their
black
rye
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
cheers
honestly
ive
never
had
a
rye
beer
before
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
doubt
theyre
all
this
good
very
drinkable
get
this
if
you
can
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
bodied
and
finishes
dry
drinkability
is
okay
a
bit
unblanced
which
detracts
from
its
drinkability
id
just
like
to
see
some
more
malt
character
drinkability
man
what
a
great
beer
probably
more
geared
towards
the
hop
heads
but
this
grain
base
and
aftertaste
just
really
round
out
the
experience
i
have
to
admit
whenever
i
see
rye
beer
i
think
of
some
nastly
ol
dry
rye
toast
however
both
renditions
from
founders
red
and
black
have
truly
been
an
enjoyable
experience
seek
out
and
enjoy
outstanding
for
sure
many
thanks
to
tikkigodxxx
for
including
this
one
in
the
trade
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
this
beer
poured
a
deep
redamber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
about
an
inch
high
the
smell
was
mostly
hops
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
was
supprisingly
bitter
there
seems
to
be
a
significant
amount
of
hop
addition
to
beginning
stage
of
this
beers
creation
they
are
very
noticable
in
the
flavor
and
more
subtle
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
great
there
is
also
some
malty
sweetness
with
a
crisp
alcohol
finish
moderate
carbonation
and
full
body
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
should
have
bought
the
lot
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
right
up
there
with
hop
rod
rye
in
my
book
another
fine
beer
to
add
to
the
session
list
damn
thats
right
i
cant
get
this
on
the
west
coast
thanks
much
jetsbeer
very
nice
reddish
to
orange
color
reminds
me
of
a
burning
sunset
nice
aromaquite
floral
and
a
nice
soft
hoppiness
to
it
bitter
flavor
upfront
i
dont
get
the
rye
really
i
think
the
bitterness
could
be
toned
down
a
touch
and
maybe
bring
the
crispness
of
the
rye
thru
a
little
more
good
body
overall
a
drinkable
beer
considering
the
bitterness
it
was
actually
quite
refreshing
worth
a
shot
thanks
to
crjmellor
for
the
sample
this
beer
poured
a
somewhat
murky
reddishcopper
color
with
a
light
head
not
totally
opaque
and
the
carbonation
to
glass
bottom
is
easily
observed
it
has
a
deep
malty
aroma
with
heavy
hints
of
citrusalmost
like
grapefruit
also
present
is
a
tinge
of
caramel
or
chocolate
tastewise
it
has
a
malty
fullbodied
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a
rye
kick
for
a
pleasant
aftertaste
there
are
definite
citrus
flavors
as
well
reds
rye
is
full
but
smooth
and
surprisingly
easy
to
swallow
despite
its
being
so
sharp
going
down
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
beer
that
is
eminently
enjoyable
but
only
when
sipped
slowly
in
order
to
understand
its
true
complexity
definitely
worth
drinking
again
and
again
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
ruby
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
of
tight
creamy
bubbles
that
produce
beautiful
lacing
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
malty
sweet
smell
with
some
caramel
overtones
followed
by
a
citruslike
hops
aroma
this
medium
bodied
ales
flavor
profile
is
dominated
by
a
citrus
hops
flavor
and
bitterness
but
with
enough
of
a
caramellike
malt
sweetness
to
back
up
all
that
hops
also
some
spicy
notes
probably
from
the
use
of
rye
as
well
as
from
the
hops
not
typical
of
a
lot
of
rye
beers
but
quite
refreshing
and
enjoyable
slippery
yet
set
with
a
bold
rich
intensity
in
a
medium
body
feel
with
very
controlled
toasty
tones
and
heavy
hop
handedness
fluffy
textured
with
hops
smooth
warm
and
toasty
oh
and
damn
yummy
another
fine
addition
to
the
founders
family
unbelievably
delicious
and
drinakable
enjoy
if
i
were
rating
the
bottled
version
it
would
still
be
4plus
but
if
you
can
get
this
on
tap
do
it
rye
eh
wasnt
fond
of
it
but
never
had
the
style
before
so
a
straightforward
review
is
in
order
started
with
a
hazy
murky
brownred
pour
with
tan
head
not
bad
at
all
aroma
was
floral
and
hoppy
which
came
thru
on
the
taste
along
with
some
citrus
and
i
guess
rye
full
bodied
rich
and
carbonated
too
bitter
sour
for
my
tastes
but
i
read
this
is
the
characteristics
of
the
style
pours
a
fivefinger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
redamber
color
hoppymalty
nose
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
starts
hoppy
and
the
hops
dominate
and
leave
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
expecting
something
a
little
more
mellow
1
75
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
for
the
style
although
there
was
a
little
room
for
improvement
overall
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
a
good
one
my
first
founders
to
cherish
i
like
rye
and
combined
with
a
hopped
up
beer
you
got
a
bold
satisfying
beer
rye
full
citrus
mouthfeel
and
some
lovely
bitter
aftertaste
genuine
red
colour
head
with
initial
hop
bubbles
i
would
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
delicious
3
weeks
later
very
nice
mouthfeel
due
to
moderate
carbonation
that
does
not
overemphasize
the
hops
very
drinkable
for
its
strength
and
hop
level
though
the
sweetness
on
the
death
gets
to
me
after
a
couple
another
very
good
offering
from
founders
though
i
prefer
the
black
rye
drinkability
and
notes

slides
down
easy
really
fantastic
beer
the
only
other
rye
beer
i
have
had
is
the
black
rye
the
two
beers
are
as
different
as
night
and
day
the
black
rye
is
a
better
showcase
for
the
flavor
of
rye
but
this
beer
is
far
superior
in
taste
and
drinkability
a
definite
must
buy
for
anyone
a
new
favorite
for
me
overall
ive
seen
this
in
local
stores
for
quite
sometime
but
just
decided
to
try
it
out
and
im
glad
i
did
sticks
out
from
any
other
brew
ive
had
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
black
rye
a
very
easy
and
refreshing
beer
to
drink
nice
and
crisp
and
not
overpowering
with
any
one
flavor
or
with
the
alcohol
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
citrus
hops
i
didnt
get
much
rye
in
the
nose
but
there
was
a
lot
of
hop
there
to
cover
it
up
the
flavor
was
very
nice
lots
of
hop
flavors
with
a
strong
rye
and
caramel
backing
very
smooth
moderate
body
and
great
drinkability
nice
edit
this
beer
is
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
bottled
review
is
forthcoming
moderately
thick
foamy
dark
cream
colored
head
leaves
strings
of
lace
as
it
slowly
fades
an
almost
hazy
ruby
tea
colored
beer
solid
citrusy
grapefruit
hop
aroma
fairly
sweet
malty
flavor
up
tastes
like
a
red
ale
and
rye
its
quickly
joined
by
some
chewy
grapefruity
hops
that
become
mildly
bitter
towards
the
end
a
tasty
hopped
up
red
ale
thanks
to
malty
for
this
crazy
bottle
the
whole
experience
is
good
for
a
few
sips
then
settles
into
an
average
bitterness
good
overall
unique
for
the
style
but
average
for
a
hoppy
ale
slàinte
very
drinkable
this
stuff
could
get
me
in
trouble
from
notes
poured
a
deep
amber
color
almost
rusty
with
a
small
head
that
sat
nicely
atop
the
beer
the
nose
was
very
nice
with
a
definate
blast
of
rye
spiceyness
and
a
citrusy
hop
with
a
nice
thick
caramel
base
underneath
the
flavor
was
complex
with
an
almost
ryebready
flavor
with
caramel
and
grapefruity
hop
everything
was
balanced
very
well
the
feel
was
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
more
thickness
would
do
it
good
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
i
liked
it
enough
to
have
it
off
tap
twice
since
the
first
bottle
the
flavor
balance
was
just
divine
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
i
would
like
to
keep
a
keg
of
it
around
in
the
summer
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
wow
tried
this
at
the
michigan
brewers
cup
last
weekend
at
copper
canyon
the
beer
was
a
deep
saturated
red
color
with
a
beige
head
the
aroma
was
caramel
and
fresh
hops
sweet
balancing
the
spice
and
flower
of
the
hop
and
the
fruitiness
of
the
yeast
great
maltbitterness
balance
keeping
the
moderate
alcohol
completely
hidden
good
creamy
mouthfeel
i
could
have
had
this
as
my
desert
but
the
turtle
cheesecake
was
too
tempting
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
wish
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
to
try
this
firts
of
many
founders
brews
iam
gonna
partake
in
over
the
next
few
dayspours
a
deep
amver
with
a
nice
fluffy
two
finger
head
leaving
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
behind
hopshops
and
more
ciruspiney
hop
with
a
little
lemon
wedge
in
there
made
me
wanna
tear
into
this
onei
am
almost
at
a
lack
of
words
on
the
flavors
and
refreshing
complexities
of
this
beerspruce
and
piney
hop
with
a
nice
firm
nutty
malt
backbone
finishing
with
a
perfect
tartness
wich
just
caps
this
off
making
for
the
almost
perfect
rounded
beer
damn
why
did
i
pass
this
up
in
the
past
i
will
be
bringing
this
home
with
me
back
to
nc
for
sure
prosit
smell
and
taste
are
apple
ciderish
musty
malt
but
musty
in
a
good
way
exceptional
in
fact
yes
you
can
also
taste
but
not
smell
the
rye
elements
this
dances
on
the
tongue
and
is
still
smooth
as
far
as
mf
and
drinkability
are
concerned
after
having
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
i
had
to
pick
up
a
six
of
it
now
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
left
i
wish
i
would
have
got
a
case
damn
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
dark
reddish
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
rings
of
lacing
were
left
by
the
floating
mound
of
foam
that
remained
quit
a
hoppy
nose
with
citric
and
some
floral
hops
jumping
out
with
a
nice
crisp
rye
undertone
light
sweet
caramel
maltiness
is
there
as
well
hops
and
rye
are
quite
an
appetizing
combination
flavor
is
similar
with
a
nice
hop
bite
to
start
is
off
plenty
of
rye
and
malt
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
light
caramel
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
pine
hops
all
blend
together
nicely
over
the
rye
bitter
hoppy
rye
finish
damn
this
is
some
tasty
and
smooth
stuff
really
creamy
medium
body
goes
down
oh
so
smooth
with
a
light
prickliness
from
the
hops
this
would
be
a
staple
in
the
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
locally
almost
like
a
hop
rod
rye
junior
great
stuff
completely
gratifying
pour
with
a
wonderful
medium
body
to
it
perhaps
imparted
by
the
rye
what
does
the
rye
do
time
to
try
the
black
rye
i
havent
yet
sampled
all
of
founderss
offerings
but
id
be
amazed
to
discover
one
that
i
like
as
well
as
reds
rye
its
easily
the
equal
of
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
if
not
quite
as
assertive
an
insanely
hopped
ale
spiced
with
rye
is
the
stuff
of
my
beery
dreams
and
i
wish
to
thank
founders
for
making
those
dreams
come
true
and
deejaydan
without
whom
this
would
not
have
been
possible
pours
a
beautiful
clear
deep
amber
color
with
plenty
of
depth
a
rocky
head
crops
up
which
leaves
sticky
lacing
as
this
brew
is
greedily
imbibed
the
aroma
is
absolutely
knockout
huge
floral
esters
massage
the
nostrils
before
sublimely
bitter
hops
assuage
any
inhibitions
flavor
begins
smooth
with
some
sweet
malts
rye
kicks
in
with
an
interesting
grainy
spiciness
before
the
pure
citrous
hop
oils
sink
into
your
brain
finish
is
citric
hops
with
a
calming
herbal
quality
never
had
a
rye
beer
before
but
i
need
to
try
out
a
few
more
after
this
one
i
was
really
surprised
in
a
pleasant
way
appearance
of
this
beer
was
deep
brown
leather
with
hints
of
orange
and
red
pearing
through
the
head
left
nice
lacing
down
my
chalice
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
yeast
and
other
remnants
of
what
i
assume
to
be
leftover
from
dryhopping
the
smell
had
a
wonderful
hop
punch
that
left
you
salivating
for
a
taste
there
was
definate
citrusy
notes
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
supremely
balanced
with
a
bitter
beginning
and
a
dryness
in
the
finish
the
rye
seemed
to
have
add
its
two
cents
in
the
finish
with
the
grainy
dryness
the
bitterness
was
exceptionally
present
but
was
not
as
heavy
as
a
iipa
overall
this
is
stuff
you
could
drink
all
night
and
love
every
once
of
it
i
foresee
founders
coming
out
with
some
phenomenal
beers
to
add
to
their
already
fabulous
line
i
e
centennial
ipa
and
breakfast
stout
d
nice
twist
on
a
red
ale
the
rye
is
very
subtle
but
it
gives
some
balance
to
the
nice
hoppiness
of
the
beer
the
hops
have
good
complexity
and
taste
very
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
has
a
cloudy
dark
amber
appearance
citrus
hop
aroma
along
with
a
smell
that
is
like
freshly
cut
wood
spicy
smell
too
the
flavor
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
presence
then
becomes
tangy
this
is
followed
by
a
dose
of
fresh
hops
and
finished
with
a
tangy
fruit
flavor
and
spice
this
beer
makes
fantastic
use
of
different
flavors
it
is
somehow
both
full
flavored
and
crisp
great
drinkability
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
this
dryhopped
red
ale
is
easy
drinking
and
produces
a
hearty
satisfying
belch
of
hop
delight
special
thanks
to
cmaruschak
drinkability
is
great
a
wonderful
beer
easy
drinkingmalt
and
hops
both
going
for
it
founders
is
my
new
favorite
brewery
wish
i
could
buy
locally
this
stuff
is
great
wish
to
think
merlin48
for
this
wonderful
beer
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
am
impatiently
awaiting
the
chance
to
try
other
offerings
from
founders
im
also
having
a
glass
of
scotts
selection
royal
brackla
from
1976
and
it
goes
very
well
with
an
ale
like
this
and
thanks
again
to
john
at
federal
wines
spirits
for
hooking
me
up
with
another
bottle
of
good
beer
cheers
great
job
founders
they
are
simply
awesome
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
good
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
as
i
could
enjoy
a
few
more
right
now
a
damn
fine
beer
i
think
more
brewers
should
experiment
with
rye
cheers
to
founders
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
soon
i
actually
enjoyed
this
more
from
the
bottle
im
guessing
the
pint
glass
i
drank
this
beer
from
at
founders
could
have
been
a
bit
dirty
im
definitley
going
to
visit
the
brewery
and
have
another
sitdown
with
this
great
beer
most
definitley
not
a
shy
beer
this
beer
went
straight
to
my
brain
dont
know
would
want
more
than
a
couple
in
a
sitting
but
a
real
treat
that
i
will
meet
again
much
thanks
to
micro
for
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
substantial
like
i
expected
refreshing
and
sticky
at
once
this
beer
seems
incredibly
fresh
and
delicious
and
as
poorly
handled
as
the
beers
in
this
area
are
its
probably
downright
heavenly
fresh
or
preferably
from
their
home
thanks
to
jahnoth
for
this
excellent
beer
overall
quite
a
satisfying
experience
founders
continues
to
impress
and
i
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
their
selection
this
is
one
hell
of
an
offering
amazing
flavors
and
overall
character
love
it
tastes
are
hoppy
and
raw
grassy
chlorophyll
and
weed
flavours
are
thick
the
hop
character
seems
to
work
very
well
with
the
rye
to
deliver
this
unique
flavourscape
those
with
truly
discerning
palates
can
taste
the
greatness
here
there
is
a
pronounced
bitter
effect
from
both
the
hops
and
the
rye
infusion
synergy
this
tight
little
brew
is
crisp
and
snappy
flavour
like
none
other
drinking
this
brew
before
trying
another
less
fortunate
beer
will
cripple
your
ability
to
taste
the
inferior
brew
this
is
robust
and
utterly
friggin
awesome
if
you
can
handle
something
of
this
magnitude
you
will
no
doubt
fall
in
love
with
it
drinkable
for
sure
pussy
ass
posers
beware
this
one
will
bite
back
atcha
ass
by
far
the
most
kick
ass
mainstay
offered
by
this
brewery
this
beer
is
outdone
by
precious
few
from
other
companies
stellar
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
it
lacks
the
presence
of
rye
i
was
looking
for
in
both
taste
and
aroma
unlike
the
black
rye
but
its
still
damn
tasty
this
beer
is
part
west
coast
ipa
and
part
rye
beer
for
the
most
part
the
rye
plays
a
subsurviant
role
the
dominat
player
in
reds
rye
is
hops
at
times
the
hops
over
run
this
beer
but
i
still
thirst
for
more
i
would
be
negligent
if
i
didnt
write
about
the
head
reds
gives
you
a
root
beer
float
head
it
stands
above
the
top
of
the
glass
but
does
not
cascade
down
the
sides
this
ryepa
is
not
to
be
missed
pours
a
deep
glowing
ruby
red
color
with
a
huge
frothy
off
white
head
that
leave
a
thick
sticky
lacing
in
my
glass
aromatic
hoppy
aromas
of
pineapple
grapefruit
and
pine
resiny
pine
citrus
and
pineapple
cake
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
bitter
and
dry
i
think
i
may
have
found
a
new
favorite
from
this
brewery
this
one
is
very
drinkable
at
6
8
since
an
amber
ale
with
rye
is
a
fairly
de
rigueur
recipe
for
homebrewers
especially
a
certain
famous
denny
recipe
this
beer
suffers
in
comparison
so
many
people
have
done
this
on
a
noncommercial
level
many
with
great
success
that
ill
be
heretical
in
calling
this
no
better
than
those
a
straight
line
of
caramel
rye
spiciness
then
hop
balance
has
the
pepper
but
not
quite
the
oiliness
and
calvadoslike
notes
that
rye
can
impart
the
brick
of
caramel
also
tames
the
rye
as
well
as
the
purported
60
ibus
in
all
not
terribly
different
from
the
brewpub
amber
ale
craze
of
many
years
back
but
a
little
funkified
to
interest
the
beer
enthusiast
overall
i
was
highly
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
great
traits
and
is
definitly
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
try
im
sure
it
will
show
up
on
my
shopping
list
again
very
soon
dulled
scarlet
red
appearance
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
bountiful
lace
the
aroma
is
a
tropical
fruit
melange
pineapple
kiwi
mango
and
some
of
that
resiny
canabis
in
the
background
the
taste
follows
suit
to
an
extent
youve
got
your
tropical
fruit
blend
some
mary
jane
but
also
some
sweet
marmalade
like
tones
the
bitterness
is
sharp
yet
clean
and
theres
a
dulled
spiciness
present
that
is
a
contribution
from
the
rye
rather
than
alcohol
i
believe
another
solid
offering
from
founders
and
another
solid
founders
offering
received
thanks
to
cokes
this
is
an
amazing
brew
and
has
definitely
replaced
twohearted
as
my
michigan
ipa
of
choice
as
beautiful
out
of
the
bottle
as
it
is
on
tap
an
infinitely
more
drinkable
version
of
its
big
brother
devil
dancer
so
smooth
and
smarmy
and
now
available
yearround
this
is
my
new
goto
brew
sexy
stuff
guys
highly
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
almost
hefty
but
not
thick
has
some
texture
to
it
not
quite
up
there
with
a
dipa
but
it
tends
in
that
direction
thanks
to
trbeer
for
sharing
this
one
representin
to
tha
fullest
drinkability
delicious
bring
me
more
a
topnotch
session
beer
packed
with
flavor
from
the
wonderful
folks
of
founders
my
experience
with
rye
beers
is
limited
to
various
examples
from
bavaria
i
cant
see
how
actual
rye
might
have
influenced
the
flavors
of
this
beer
in
the
slightest
way
it
would
be
obliterated
by
caramel
malt
and
hops
yet
as
for
the
brand
name
rye
has
so
many
poetic
possibilities
wry
reds
rye
and
so
on
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
there
is
not
so
much
competition
in
the
rye
beer
category
this
beer
pours
a
nicely
carbonated
crimson
color
a
dirty
tan
head
form
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
great
citrus
and
pine
all
the
way
a
very
noticable
northwestern
hop
profile
the
taste
is
very
piney
as
to
be
expected
from
the
smell
some
caramel
peaks
through
and
tries
to
add
some
balance
the
rye
is
definitely
present
giving
the
ever
famous
rye
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
a
fantastic
beer
glad
i
saw
this
stuff
here
in
miltown
last
week
knowing
i
dont
have
to
go
to
madison
for
this
stuff
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
simply
put
a
fantastic
beer
much
thanks
to
skidz
for
the
sample
aroma
is
a
hit
as
soon
as
the
bottle
is
opened
citric
hop
that
citric
is
carried
over
to
the
taste
along
with
pine
grapefruit
and
a
good
dose
of
rye
malt
the
mouthfeel
reflects
the
blast
of
hop
while
leaving
a
hop
oil
feel
drinkability
is
good
for
its
crisp
near
red
ipa
can
get
huge
thanks
to
skidz
for
this
brew
crisp
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
nice
lively
carbonation
in
a
medium
body
well
done
founders
you
had
me
at
centennial
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
all
night
i
absolutely
adore
the
blend
of
citrusy
hops
and
light
rye
flavor
this
beer
along
with
its
founders
bretheren
will
find
their
way
into
my
fridge
on
a
frequent
basis
oh
baby
according
to
their
website
this
brewerys
motto
is
ignore
mainstream
and
push
the
envelope
im
getting
alarmed
about
the
three
bottles
of
devil
dancer
i
bought
the
same
day
as
this
rye
ale
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
copper
body
with
a
small
beige
head
that
quickly
falls
into
ring
and
film
nice
spiderweb
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
has
a
ton
of
hops
a
strong
note
of
spicy
rye
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
hops
are
pine
grapefruit
and
hemp
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
coating
of
pine
resin
hops
taste
is
lots
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
rye
caramel
malt
is
difficult
to
appreciate
underneath
the
massive
hopping
this
one
goes
down
really
easy
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
as
biting
as
i
feared
i
am
very
fond
of
rye
malt
in
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
hops
are
allowed
to
romp
around
all
over
the
malts
here
but
i
just
happen
to
be
in
a
hoppy
mood
as
i
finish
this
one
off
not
quite
ready
for
their
devil
dancer
though
impressive
brewery
and
a
bold
rendering
of
a
rye
ale
here
from
the
bottle
poured
crimson
red
with
a
nice
fluffy
light
tan
head
aroma
a
nose
full
of
hops
malts
grapefruits
hints
of
caramel
molasses
the
hops
were
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
which
was
good
nice
mouth
feel
has
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
it
grapefruit
do
not
know
what
malted
rye
taste
like
but
there
is
a
flavor
in
here
that
i
like
so
maybe
that
is
it
good
beer
this
one
pours
out
to
a
dark
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
slight
to
medium
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
is
excellent
with
said
pine
coming
through
via
the
hop
presence
this
one
has
great
malt
backbone
as
well
as
someone
else
mentioned
this
reminded
me
of
a
west
coast
beer
and
reminded
me
of
offerings
from
stone
and
sierra
nevada
very
reminiscent
of
a
pale
ale
cruising
toward
ipaterritory
with
hints
of
spice
and
pepper
this
beer
looked
exactly
like
the
imperial
ipa
from
founders
on
the
pour
crimson
red
in
color
with
a
one
inch
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
smell
is
very
bready
and
somewhat
sweet
the
taste
was
sweet
upfront
with
a
caramel
flavor
the
top
has
a
rye
base
to
it
and
was
quite
thick
the
finish
was
hoppy
but
not
really
bitter
quite
a
thick
and
complex
beer
with
some
bold
flavors
but
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
a
good
beer
to
try
at
founders
but
there
are
better
choices
at
their
brewery
drinkability
is
pretty
high
could
definitely
be
comfortable
with
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
o
3
25
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
flaw
there
is
an
off
taste
and
smell
that
keep
this
from
really
knocking
it
out
of
the
park
id
be
tempted
to
buy
another
one
of
these
and
see
if
it
was
a
bad
beer
i
enjoy
founders
brews
but
i
have
to
rate
what
is
in
front
of
me
that
being
said
i
have
to
knock
some
points
off
this
one
for
the
chlorine
smelltaste
solid
roasty
flavors
with
a
touch
of
spice
from
the
rye
love
the
black
color
solid
beer
w
good
hop
taste
not
a
porter
but
a
good
lager
type
dark
beer
smooth
finish
deep
black
great
smell
of
hops
and
dough
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
creamy
body
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
rye
malt
not
trying
to
kill
you
with
hops
or
rye
or
roasted
notes
like
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
category
great
overall
beer
and
something
i
hope
to
see
again
d
this
was
like
a
black
ipa
with
extra
rye
added
nice
balance
in
the
scent
and
taste
although
the
body
was
a
little
weak
the
finish
was
fairly
smooth
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
ground
breaking
but
a
unique
high
quality
brew
again
founders
calls
this
a
hopped
dark
ale
brewed
with
rye
and
i
think
it
tastes
like
a
stout
with
rye
it
is
similar
to
their
breakfast
stout
with
less
of
everything
but
hops
o
black
rye
is
down
right
awesome
theres
just
something
about
black
ales
ipa
brewed
with
rye
that
do
me
in
it
just
goes
well
and
makes
it
a
brew
i
can
enjoy
any
time
i
didnt
get
to
try
this
back
the
first
go
round
but
im
glad
they
released
it
im
hoping
this
is
one
that
will
be
around
for
years
to
come
one
of
the
best
black
ales
ive
ever
had
basically
and
excellent
porter
with
a
peppery
like
spicyness
not
very
hoppy
or
bitter
at
all
very
nice
beer
black
rye
is
a
beautiful
opaque
obsidian
shade
and
a
stubborn
antique
white
head
encircles
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
after
the
initial
pour
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
is
left
artfully
behind
a
lively
woodsy
aroma
comes
off
the
brew
with
bitter
citrus
oak
smoke
whiskey
grains
burnt
toast
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
as
well
i
am
loving
this
first
of
all
i
must
say
that
this
is
very
soft
and
smooth
and
lighterbodied
than
expected
however
there
is
a
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
following
a
good
gulp
the
hops
are
in
the
foreground
and
they
present
themselves
in
a
nicely
dry
and
bitter
way
id
say
these
are
almost
herbally
pungent
in
essence
the
roast
and
rye
serve
to
compliment
the
hops
with
subtle
grace
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
to
any
person
who
likes
to
explore
the
complexities
of
hop
bitterness
in
a
unique
way
overall
fantastic
beer
bottled
in
dec
pours
a
very
dark
nice
quarter
inch
head
alot
of
chocolate
on
the
smell
same
with
taste
back
end
is
where
the
rye
comes
in
a
ton
going
on
in
this
beer
and
i
love
it
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
effervescent
overall
pretty
good
beer
this
is
the
best
rye
beer
i
have
ever
had
thus
far
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
phenomenal
o

this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
rye
beer
style
this
works
as
a
slow
sipper
but
would
be
even
better
paired
up
with
some
barbecue
or
other
smoked
meats
having
mine
with
a
smokey
chopped
beef
barbecue
sandwich

very
unique
taste
one
could
mistake
this
for
a
hoppedup
imperial
stout
great
slowsipper
tastes
interesting
not
bad
the
rye
comes
out
and
stays
in
palate
dry
hops
adds
some
bitterness
smell
heavy
oily
lingers
o
this
showcases
the
rye
quite
nicely
and
the
hop
profile
is
complementary
recommended
overall
this
is
is
definitely
an
interesting
twist
on
a
black
ale
but
does
it
work
id
say
so
i
enjoy
the
smokey
malt
flavor
upfront
with
the
rye
hop
finish
but
somethings
missing
to
make
it
truly
great
and
i
cant
pinpoint
it
yet
i
think
id
prefer
less
bitterness
on
the
backend
very
interesting
though
black
pour
with
thin
brown
head
sweet
and
toasted
aromas
taste
some
nice
hop
bitterness
up
front
with
some
smoked
coffee
notes
in
a
relatively
clean
finish
agree
with
the
reviews
outstanding
will
buy
again
black
beer
with
hops
roasty
malt
and
rye
overall
founders
gets
an
a
for
uniqueness
ive
never
had
anything
resembling
the
brew
only
some
of
the
hoppier
porters
come
close
but
they
have
a
different
hops
profile
and
lack
the
rye
flavor
of
this
beer
it
all
blends
remarkably
well
and
makes
for
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
i
think
this
works
nicely
with
food
i
had
it
with
a
bowl
of
chili
if
i
have
a
complaint
it
is
simply
the
price
but
in
return
you
get
a
quality
brew
a
roller
coaster
beer
ride
of
flavors
that
work
very
well
together
with
nice
balance
and
smooth
almost
slick
feel
the
carbonation
was
a
little
lighter
than
average
the
bitterness
was
slightly
above
average
and
the
finish
was
different
after
every
sip
a
really
enjoyable
beer
that
is
very
different
and
hides
the
abv
completely
while
remaining
quite
easy
to
drink
the
rye
is
present
in
every
aspect
of
this
brew
and
makes
for
a
wonderful
leading
role
o
very
nicely
layered
balanced
taste
especially
for
a
black
ipa
o
grabbed
a
single
which
i
wont
do
again
based
on
the
price
but
will
defintiely
be
looking
for
it
next
year
to
see
if
i
can
pick
it
up
when
its
fresher
fans
of
black
ipas
will
enjoy
this
one
pours
an
opaque
and
deeply
dark
black
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
maintains
its
size
nice
sticky
lacing
too
smells
of
pine
and
spicey
from
the
rye
a
hint
of
roast
and
chocolate
they
rye
is
even
more
prominent
once
sipping
very
strong
rye
flavors
and
a
good
firm
bitter
finish
hints
of
roast
flavors
behind
the
rye
spiciness
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
beer
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
well
done
definitely
some
pros
and
cons
to
this
experience
i
think
the
balance
of
the
aromas
and
flavor
is
quite
nice
at
time
the
body
feels
somewhat
thin
to
support
what
is
going
on
a
solid
hoppy
dark
ale
with
charred
chocolate
grains
and
bright
hops
black
in
color
off
white
head
decent
head
retention
nice
aroma
of
a
well
rounded
hop
aroma
paired
with
just
a
little
toasty
malt
flavor
taste
is
hop
dominated
moderately
black
in
color
and
impenetrable
to
light
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
is
present
brussels
lacing
the
nose
brings
dark
maltearthy
rye
notes
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
as
advertised
in
the
nose
with
the
rye
leading
the
way
the
bitter
dark
malt
would
be
next
but
the
rye
is
certainly
dominant
the
mouth
is
slightly
viscous
and
chewy
color
is
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
a
very
nice
looking
beer
definitely
rye
on
the
nose
along
with
some
roasted
malt
and
citrusy
hops
flavor
is
crisp
citrus
hops
followed
by
roasted
malt
with
a
dry
semibitter
finish
its
a
very
good
example
of
using
rye
without
overpowering
the
beer
the
rye
is
there
and
works
well
with
the
hops
overall
first
the
hops
and
malts
clash
then
rye
turns
a
weird
fruity
instead
of
spicy
then
the
bad
phenols
just
top
it
off
def
not
the
best
beer
by
founders
they
kinda
missed
altogether
on
this
one
imo
the
taste
has
a
powerful
earthy
and
piney
bitterness
that
overtakes
references
to
the
dark
malts
and
grain
picked
up
in
the
first
mouth
swirl
lingering
bite
at
the
end
o
overall
great
flavors
coming
from
this
brew
well
balanced
and
great
mixture
of
everything
in
this
brew
definitely
want
more
of
this

nails
every
thing
they
do
deep
brown
hue
with
a

aromas
are
a
bit
metallic
and
tinny
but
you
get
some
very
nice
roast
as
well
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
break
up
the
flavor
into
decadent
layers
rich
roast
some
leather
touch
of
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of

hearty
and
delicious
beer

the
closest
thing
ive
had
to
the
blakkr
collaboration
that
was

alesurly3f
i
had
the
surly
version

until

very

unique

those
guys
in

can
brew
with
the
best
of
them
and
its
a
shame
they
dont
distribute
their
product
in
california
hopefully
the
recent
announcement
of
expansion
means
well
finally
get
their
beers
out
here
come
on
do
it
something
about
the
burnt
flavors
and
the
spicy
rye
just
does
not
excite
me
i
enjoy
a
good
use
of
rye
and
i
think
the
concept
is
interesting
but
i
cant
say
i
love
this
still
definitely
worth
a
try
o
so
glad
founders
brought
this
out
of
retirement
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
make
this
very
enjoyable
overall

have
this

in

o
i
will
need
to
try
another
and
see
if
my
impressions
change
over
all
this
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
the
rye
adds
a
great
flavor
to
the
black
malt
and
hops
pours
a
deep
notquiteblack
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
on
and
leaves
nice
small
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
splendid
with
hints
of
rye
spice
black
malt
roast
and
pine
hops
the
taste
is
even
better
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
with
additional
floral
and
earthy
hops
and
some
rye
spice
added
in
the
body
is
a
great
weight
not
to
heavy
or
slick
but
with
a
nice
feel
and
a
little
spice
bite
on
the
finish
smokey
earthy
and
dare
i
say
leathery
taste
notes
ok
brew
but
not
sure
the
flavor
really
works
that
well
for
me
i
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
more
than
i
did
there
are
multiple
components
of
this
beer
i
enjoyed
but
the
lingering
sense
of
licking
an
ashtray
ruined
this
one
for
me
ill
probably
try
another
some
day
just
to
make
sure
my
palate
wasnt
off
when
i
drank
this
but
otherwise
i
dont
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
beer
taste
sharp
and
spiky
with
lots
of
roasty
even
burnt
chocolate
malts
the
hop
content
rears
its
head
with
an
earthiness
that
works
well
in
conjunction
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
balance
is
good
and
this
is
a
solid
welldone
and
very
drinkable
ale
that
i
best
describe
as
a
hoppedup
porter
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
huge
four
finger
off
white
head
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
some
lacing
the
odor
is
powerful
roasted
malts
coffee
bitter
chocolate
nutty
herbal
rye
earthy
the
taste
is
full
bodied
velvety
malty
nutty
rye
bitter
chocolate
grassy
earthy
very
roasted
bitter
dry
on
the
backed
with
a
touch
more
body
this
would
be
unreal
having
said
that
its
very
very
good
overall
id
enjoy
this
a
bit
more
if
the
toastedburnt
flavors
were
more
subdued
and
the
hops
shone
a
bit
more
tasty
and
one
of
the
very
first
black
ipas
well
before
there
was
such
a
thing
worth
a
try
and
to
the
nostalgic
beer
nut
in
me
its
always
nice
to
see
beers
that
have
been
retired
for
nearly
a
decade
make
a
return
1010
would
drink
again
very
nice
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
it
much
i
guess
that
is
why
i
try
to
sample
them
all
overall
i
never
had
the
opportunity
to
try
when
this
first
was
out
if
the
recipe
truly
hasnt
changed
then
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
considering
it
was
around
before
the
black
ipa
trend
was
around
good
balance
between
the
hop
bitterness
roasted
malt
flavor
and
spicy
rye
notes
also
impressive
the
rye
component
in
the
aroma
really
like
this
beer
rye
comes
through
its
nice
and
thick
very
solid
o
very
tasty
rye
beer
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
lots
of
flavours
nice
complexity
good
integration
the
rye
works
well
with
the
hops
here
to
be
fair
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
and
maybe
its
a
good
example
of
what
a
rye
beer
should
be
i
like
everything
else
that
founders
puts
out
ill
definitely
revisit
after
ive
tried
a
few
other
examples
poured
a
black
body
with
one
finger
head
and
has
an
aroma
of
roasted
malts
almost
burnt
along
with
some
minor
hops
in
there
fuller
bodied
beer
with
a
dry
more
roasted
malt
with
rye
taste
and
the
hops
seem
to
be
in
background
a
little
thick
and
sweet
with
nice
balance
and
the
hops
cash
in
on
the
end
dry
citrusy
pretty
good
beer
thats
a
change
of
pace
from
other
dark
beers
the
flavor
of
rye
malt
with
slight
coffeelike
roasted
elements
and
some
mild
bitterness
of
hops
with
a
slight
spice
quality
which
is
peppery
and
continues
with
hops
and
mild
alcohol
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
great
rye
with
stoutlike
qualities
nice
dark
malt
taste
o
a
very
nice
addition
or
should
i
say
readdition
to
the
seasonal
lineup
very
well
balanced
with
the
rye
roast
and
hops
all
working
great
together
bitterness
is
also
balanced
by
a
nice
light
sweetness
definitely
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
enjoyed
reds
rye
in
bottles
or
their
darker
beers
dark
brown
with

edges

location
you
have
to
try
its
worth
it
like
a
porter
stout
but
with
more
of
a
easier
finish
you
have
to
watch
youself
since
you
could
drink
the
whole
6
pack
in
one
sitting
and
the
apv
is

thumbs
up
to
founders
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
head
when
going
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
head
quickly
fades
away
found
there
not
to
be
much
of
a
rye
taste
but
more
of
bitter
flavor
on
the
front
and
dry
chocolate
favor
on
the
back
not
big
on
dry
finishes
so
feel
was
very
good
overall
an
outstanding
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
off
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
roasted
qualities
rye
grain
and
a
bit
of
an
off
scent
the
taste
is
much
better
with
nice
dark
malt
flavor
spicy
rye
not
to
mention
the
citrus
flavor
from
dry
hopping
roasted
malt
reminiscent
of
the
same
found
in
breakfast
stout
or
porter
this
is
another
tasty
brew
from
founders
full
bodied
smooth
brew
and
good
taste
i
would
drink
this
again
though
it
is
getting
a
bit
expensive
pours
black
and
with
tan
head
of
foam
that
fell
pretty
quickly
to
a
film
and
ring
on
top
nose
is
aloft
with
a
nice
bit
of
hops
and
some
spicy
and
fragrant
rye
citrus
peel
and
a
touch
of
twiggy
pine
to
my
surprise
i
then
discovered
a
lightish
chocolate
scent
and
a
bit
of
bread
taste
is
very
unique
the
malt
in
this
one
is
full
but
strict
it
has
a
bitterness
that
is
up
front
to
the
palate
smooths
out
after
the
first
sip
to
show
you
a
very
brisk
palate
of
dark
malt
chocolate
that
is
not
too
sweet
and
a
touch
of
smooth
weaker
coffee
the
citrus
peel
is
just
bright
to
the
flavor
so
its
not
out
of
place
only
a
light
pine
in
the
finish
and
it
does
finish
crisp
and
with
that
rye
to
come
to
the
aftertaste
pretty
strongly
mouthfeel
is
on
the
fuller
side
i
kept
thinking
i
tasted
the
hops
in
the
finish
but
they
are
well
balanced
and
this
one
favors
the
malt
just
enough
to
keep
your
interest
and
not
too
much
bitterness
to
linger
did
not
enjoy
the
smokey
taste
in
this
one
great
black
rye
pale
aleipa
hard
to
tell
exactly
which
category
it
belongs
in
and
thats
one
thing
i
love
about
american
brewers
im
impressed
with
the
extra
additions
of
roasted
malt
it
really
enhances
the
flavor
and
makes
it
a
malt
forward
brew
overall
this
was
a
nice
surprise
to
find
during
our
second
visit
to
founders
we
had
though
this
was
long
since
retired
but
were
happy
to
see
its
name
up
on
the
tap
board
through
our
critique
we
found
this
to
be
much
more
along
the
lines
of
a
rye
porter
or
ryeheavy
stout
when
compared
to
your
typical
rye
ales
that
are
becoming
more
and
more
popular
it
certainly
takes
its
dark
label
to
nice
and
new
depths
across
all
aspects
and
departments
making
for
a
uniquely
experienced
beer
the
grain
is
wonderfully
represented
especially
the
heavy
roast
to
it
and
the
authenticity
of
the
rye
this
gives
a
fuller
presentation
to
it
very
bold
and
heavily
drying
stylistically
and
it
seems
almost
naughty
like
smoking
a
cigarette
where
youre
not
supposed
to
the
rye
was
lacking
neither
an
excellent
black
ipa
nor
an
excellent
rye
ale
a
mediocre
beer
trying
to
do
too
much
very
dark
bitter
but
with
less
hops
and
rye
than
i
would
like
pours
really
dark
almost
black
with
little
or
no
head
has
a
mild
malt
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
has
a
strong
taste
with
a
burnt
coffee
and
molasses
hint
with
maybe
a
little
licorice
coming
through
a
little
carbonation
with
a
nice
finish
overall
a
nice
strong
beer
that
has
a
very
different
dark
finish
to
it
o
i
was
dissapointed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
better
what
a
shockeranother
winner
from
founders
yes
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
it
imo
if
you
like
flavorful
beers
with
great
mouthfeel
this
is
for
you
o
not
at
all
what
i
expected
as
ive
never
had
a
rye
beer
before
but
im
impressed
its
not
something
id
get
all
the
time
but
its
something
id
get
again
it
feels
versatile
id
have
it
any
time
of
year
with
almost
any
food
that
could
take
a
slightly
darker
beer
overall
i
picked
this
one
up
not
knowing
what
to
expect
beyond
tasting
some
rye
which
i
enjoy
founders
does
great
work
in
nearly
everything
they
do
this
is
no
exception
just
temper
your
expecations
based
on
your
personal
tates
this
one
was
a
win
for
sure
but
not
outstanding
overall
i
like
the
dark
penance
more
damn
i
hate
rye
beers
pours
jet
black
low
head
that
remains
around
the
edges
leaves
spotty
lace
the
aroma
is
very
nice
roasty
coffee
is
the
primary
feature
flavor
starts
out
predominately
coffee
some
chocolate
notes
the
rye
kicks
in
noticeably
on
the
finish
with
that
telltale
peppery
spicy
kick
clean
finish
im
nota
big
coffee
guy
but
i
liked
this
one
probably
because
it
is
an
enjoyably
complex
brew
something
about
this
beer
i
dont
know
exactly
what
it
is
its
somewhat
light
tasting
to
me
but
i
guess
thats
part
of
what
makes
it
so
great
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
what
some
people
may
find
to
be
the
worst
part
the
subtlety
of
the
rye
is
excellent
and
the
feel
is
fantastic
as
well
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
helluva
lot
from
this
beer
but
its
a
great
one
nice
combination
of
ashy
coffee
grounds
prickly
rye
and
earthy
hops
in
the
nose
the
flavor
profile
is
largely
the
same
this
drinks
like
a
hoppy
stout
to
me
roasted
to
the
point
of
char
maltiness
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
its
hard
to
tell
the
rye
notes
from
the
hops
i
just
know
it
all
works
well
i
loved
the
lingegring
bitter
ash
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
oily
side
this
has
a
great
combination
of
flavors
hoppy
and
malt
rye
smooth
and
with
consitant
taste
from
one
beer
to
the
next
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
founders
is
really
pushing
the
limits
on
pricing
for
a
good
but
not
great
beer
worth
a
try
but
i
doubt
i
go
back
tasted
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
on
january
24
2015
pretty
tasty
for
a
black
rye
worth
a
try
at
least
once
founders
just
puts
out
some
of
the
best
yearround
varieties
out
there
not
a
huge
fan
of
all
the
black
ipas
out
there
but
this
is
my
favorite
to
date
good
offering
from
a
good
brewery
excellent
offering
from
the
folks
at
founders
brewing
biting
hoppiness
finishes
a
big
dark
roasted
rye
base
this
is
a
bad
mother
here
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
i
loved
every
sip
of
this
amazing
beer
overall
a
nice
hearty
rye
beer
done
right
a
nice
dry
aftertaste
but
still
what
sticks
out
in
my
mind
about
this
one
is
hemp
o
plausibly
a
beer
that
was
ahead
of
its
times
when
it
was
first
brewed
im
so
glad
they
brought
it
back
glass
perfect
pint
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
getting
as
a
trip
back
to
2006
i
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
past
and
hop
it
comes
into
rotation
as
well
this
is
a
solid
black
ipa
but
its
nothing
crazy
its
basically
like
a
lighter
version
of
dark
penance
its
good
but
it
doesnt
match
up
with
alot
of
the
heavy
swingers
in
the
style
imo
overall
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
black
ipa
brewed
with
rye
lending
an
earthy
spice
character
to
the
char
and
resincitrus
canvas
good
stuff
overall
ive
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
about
10
years
finally
saw
it
here
in
minnesota
very
unusual
smell
but
interesting
pretty
tasty
stuff
and
a
nice
blend
of
rye
and
roasted
flavors
rjt
sleek
and
crisp
and
dark
and
complex
starts
out
a
bit
uptight
but
soon
warms
up
and
lets
you
in
id
hit
it
again
overall
i
think
it
is
another
fine
founders
ale
with
a
very
different
take
on
a
fairly
rare
style
more
of
a
black
rye
ipa
actually
big
nose
of
coffee
pine
very
interesting
thing
once
the
rye
kicks
in
we
enjoyed
this
in
charlotte
nc
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
it
again
always
down
for
a
new
founders
beer
nice
black
alehop
tones
kind
of
a
robust
toasted
tone
to
it
as
well
consistent
flavor
a
nice
drinker
a
decent
fusion
beer
basically
a
rye
black
ipa
the
rye
and
the
black
malts
work
well
at
times
but
not
as
well
at
others
i
dont
pick
up
the
dryhopping
at
all
78
ibu
in
the
2015
version
o
very
unique
offering
from
founders
and
they
hit
the
mark
once
again
o
this
was
interested
and
seemed
all
over
the
board
at
times
im
a
huge
founders
fan
but
this
wasnt
my
favorite
unlike
about
3
or
4
rye
beers
this
is
very
interesting
and
flavorful
i
love
it
12
oz
bottled
on
121214
great
roasted
malt
chocolate
flavors
up
front
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
and
bitterness
an
outstanding
original
i
enjoy
rye
beers
and
black
ipas
so
idk
if
they
caught
me
on
a
bad
day
had
a
fresh
pour
at
the
common
table
cbs
event
and
it
was
flat
out
turrible
burnt
just
grossness
on
par
with
old
underwear
an
outlier
maybe
but
i
know
what
i
drank
tasted
like
dookey
drinks
thin
and
watery
but
still
has
bold
flavor
very
good
drink
highly
recommended
oanother
solid
beer
from
founders
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
rush
back
out
for
it
o
a
solid
if
unmemorable
entry
into
the
black
ipa
market
something
about
the
taste
just
did
not
impress
me
perhaps
the
combination
of
dry
ciyrus
and
char
still
an
enjoyable
beer
o
excellent
rendition
of
a
hoppy
black
rye
enjoyed
the
pepper
from
the
rye
but
it
did
not
have
much
aroma
and
to
me
it
was
too
bitter
really
enjoyed
this
but
the
finish
is
quite
astringent
with
the
rye
spice
and
dark
roast
malts
contributing
extra
bitterness
damn
good
for
the
style
super
rich
dark
notes
along
with
some
juicy
citrus
i
am
justin
t
coons
and
i
approve
of
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
leaning
more
to
the
stout
side
than
ipa
side
for
me
though
o
a
good
beer
overall
lots
of
robust
dark
malt
characters
and
rye
as
well
o
enjoyable
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
complexity
to
the
flavors
and
aromas
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
one
i
would
grab
again
and
im
not
always
a
fan
of
black
ipas
which
this
is
obviously
a
hybrid
with
overall
this
is
different
more
rye
than
most
rye
beers
and
pretty
complex
great
rye
beer
lot
of
flavor
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bitter
but
actually
just
right
a
very
nice
beer
o
it
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
boring
to
me
i
prefer
reds
rye
much
more
and
dont
really
care
for
the
amount
of
roast
to
hops
i
like
how
founders
has
done
hopped
dark
beers
with
dark
penance
and
inspired
artist
but
not
this
one
plus
i
think
this
beer
is
overpriced
like
reds
rye
and
should
be
a
six
pack
for
the
12
bucks
they
are
charging
i
hate
seeing
old
hoppy
beers
especially
dark
ones
and
i
know
the
price
point
has
got
to
be
turning
some
people
away
like
it
is
dark
penance
im
not
a
huge
rye
fan
or
much
of
a
black
ipa
guy
but
this
one
hits
all
the
right
spots
huge
hop
presence
on
the
nose
great
complex
flavor
as
well
lightly
carbonated
full
of
flavor
unique
style
but
i
appreciate
that
it
was
reserved
and
balanced
not
over
the
top
amazing
smell
taste
mouthfeel
etc
pours
nearly
black
with
only
a
hint
of
ruby
showing
through
near
the
base
the
khaki
head
is
modest
but
nicely
creamy
and
sticks
to
the
surface
well
smells
deeply
malty
char
nuts
caramelized
sugar
and
coffee
with
some
leafy
earthy
hops
flavors
of
black
malt
burnt
sugar
chocolate
coffee
roast
and
some
resinous
pine
some
earthy
peppery
spicy
bite
that
may
be
from
the
rye
smooth
medium
body
with
a
solid
bitterness
about
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
glad
they
brought
it
back
i
remember
being
pretty
disappointed
when
they
discontinued
it
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malt
rye
faint
smokiness
spice
earthy
taste
bitter
toasty
malt
rye
spice
zest
hint
cocoa
earthiness
reminds
me
a
lot
of
wookey
jack
really
good
hop
aroma
doesnt
skimp
on
the
rye
spiciness
like
others
of
the
style
do
more
charry
and
assertive
overall
than
dark
penance
good
offering
but
i
prefer
my
rye
less
hoppy
itll
be
nice
when
founders
bottle
reds
rye
again
very
good
had
out
of
bottle
overall
great
beer
great
hoppy
option
for
the
colder
months
as
founders
states
this
beer
really
doesnt
have
a
specific
style
named
very
literally
quality
beer
as
expected
a
must
try
delicious
delicious
delicious
yum
yum
impressively
bitter
but
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
very
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
overall
a
really
good
black
ale
good
strong
and
balanced
mix
of
hop
and
dark
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
kick
of
rye
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
has
a
grapefruit
and
dark
roasted
malt
aftertaste
a
nice
beer
which
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
is
my
hangover
cure
brew
for
the
day
after
my
birthday
black
in
body
with
coffee
head
that
flows
to
the
edges
aroma
of
rye
with
slight
sour
cocoa
coffee
bean
and
dirt
tastes
of
rye
cocoa
coffee
dirt
cola
and
tobacco
ash
with
some
alcohol
on
the
back
end
thick
in
body
with
high
carbonation
overall
black
rye
is
one
of
the
more
unique
yet
balanced
beers
that
i
have
had
the
hops
and
dark
malts
are
blended
perfectly
and
the
rye
really
adds
another
dimension
of
flavor
to
the
beer
12
oz
bottle
poirs
a
dark
black
color
with
tannish
brown
head
this
one
is
okay
but
one
of
my
least
favorites
from
founders
reminds
me
of
the
adult
taste
that
raisin
bran
had
to
me
when
i
was
8
years
old
graduating
from
count
chocula
and
captain
crunch
cereals
o
an
easy
to
drink
black
ipa
very
smooth
well
hidden
abv
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
three
main
aspects
roasted
malt
hops
and
rye
they
were
all
represented
nicely
with
no
single
aspect
sticking
out
too
much
and
being
overpowering
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
slightly
creamy
dry
on
the
finish
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
would
be
a
good
amount
for
me
anymore
than
that
and
it
might
start
to
be
too
filling
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
it
was
just
where
it
needed
to
be
and
it
made
for
a
really
nice
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
its
good
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
again
it
would
be
nice
to
have
on
hand
for
when
i
feel
like
a
dark
rye
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
likes
rye
beers
i
think
its
worth
a
try
and
its
similar
to
a
black
ipa
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
bitter
as
most
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
just
a
little
impressed
founders
shows
just
how
talented
they
are
with
how
great
of
balance
this
beer
has
i
get
all
the
aspects
that
im
looking
for
and
they
dont
step
on
each
others
toes
and
i
dont
think
thats
easy
to
do
when
it
comes
to
a
beer
like
this
this
isnt
a
favorite
from
founders
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
dark
rye
beer
that
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
was
one
tasty
beer
keep
up
the
hard
work
its
clean
and
citrus
flavor
captures
the
fleeting
bitterness
of
white
grapefruit
particularly
well
even
while
burnt
pine
needles
and
peppercorn
offer
a
special
zing
in
its
dry
and
drinkable
finish
despite
butting
up
against
the
friction
of
imperial
strength
great
addition
to
the
seasonal
list
by
founders
as
always
they
never
dissapoint
a
nice
hybrid
between
a
black
ipa
and
rye
ipa
flat
black
with
a
small
tan
head
an
aroma
of
roast
malt
and
pine
creamy
body
with
moderate
carbonation
flavors
of
roast
malt
coffee
chocolate
rye
and
pine
dry
finish
with
lingering
pine
and
coffee
this
is
delicious
love
it
all
around
great
the
dry
hopped
flavor
really
ties
this
one
together
o
really
good
stuff
glad
i
grabbed
the
4pack
today
even
at
12
99
per
bottle
pours
a
very
serious
black
dark
tan
head
head
leaves
sticky
thick
lacing
very
roasty
with
a
pine
and
citrus
hoppiness
that
isnt
too
shy
pumpernickel
bread
dehydrated
cereal
grains
flavor
is
a
makes
me
think
stout
more
than
black
ipa
he
notes
on
this
page
say
its

but
the
label
says

bitterness
is
lingering
it
isnt
preposterously
bitter
roast
dark
neutral
chocolate
piney
hops
a
bit
of
burnt
rye
bread
just
the
tiniest
whisper
of
minty

i
recently
purchased
a
four
pack
of
founders
dark
penance
and
it
was
far
too
bold
for
my
taste
i
was
nervous
about
this
one
being
too
similar
but
its
a
full
standard
deviation
below
dark
pennance
in
terms
of
ridiculously
coercive
flavors
probably
going
to
take
some
time
to
burn
through
the
four
pack
i
imagne
another
bomber
and
sixer
might
be
purchased
and
drank
before
i
finish
this
quartet
i
still
trust
founders
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
i
liked
the
hops
flavor
and
the
feel
of
this
beer
couple
definite
enjoy
of
couple
of
these
o
very
good
black
ipa
and
the
rye
adds
a
nice
twist
not
something
i
would
want
every
day
but
an
excellent
once
in
a
while
beer
this
beer
is
outstanding
just
as
good
cold
as
it
is
warm
delicious
is
an
understatement
beautiful
dark
beer
smells
amazing
and
has
a
rich
malty
aroma
the
hoppiness
is
a
bit
to
much
for
my
liking
but
a
lot
of
people
love
this
beer
i
picked
it
up
at
my
local
meijer
the
day
they
put
it
on
the
shelves
solid
black
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
roasty
earthy
resinous
and
a
little
spicy
easy
drinking
at
7
5
is
dangerous
i
finished
it
before
this
review
good
stuff
love
it
black
ipas
are
my
favorite
theres
some
good
character
here
but
even
if
not
being
the
biggest
rye
fan
still
the
parts
dont
really
seem
to
jive
and
fit
well
here
slightly
comes
out
kind
of
session
feeling
too
which
at
6
6
abv
doesnt
really
work
over
well
either
not
horrible
but
not
great
either
nice
mix
between
a
black
ipa
and
a
rye
beer
roasted
taste
with
a
spicy
rye
finish
if
you
like
rye
beers
this
might
be
a
must
have
the
dark
malt
flavors
play
in
but
the
rye
dominates
i
am
a
little
torn
between
the
fact
that
its
a
well
made
beer
but
a
bit
dry
for
me
on
this
tasting
will
have
to
revisit
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
rye
beer
very
nice
to
see
a
dryhopped
black
ale
that
isnt
completely
hopcentric
despite
the
wonderful
aroma
from
the
dryhop
really
lets
the
malt
base
and
especially
the
rye
shine
o
reminded
me
of
a
black
ipa
made
with
rye
this
is
7
5
abv
rye
and
black
ipas
are
not
my
favorite
flavor
profiles
but
this
one
offers
the
redeeming
fact
that
both
are
dominated
by
citrusy
flavoring
hops
mid
palate
bitterness
overwhelms
my
palate
in
the
finish
12
ounce

fairly

with
a
12

to
a

that
lingers
nice

is

alcohol
is
very
well

with

present
after

overall
this
is
an
excellent
black

style
all
around
great
complexity

balance
of

hops
and
moderate
roastedbready
malt
sweetness
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
its
rather
brash
and
unapologetic
but
so
are
most
black
ipas
this
one
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
the
complex
grain
bill
and
multidimensional
hop
profile
though
both
offer
that
doubledose
of
bitterness
expected
of
the
style
that
you
either
love
or
hate
the
tandem
of
noble
and
american
hops
in
particular
stood
out
roasted
malts
and
hops
are
the
centerpiece
of
this
beer
the
best
comparison
would
be
a
black
ipa
just
take
away
the
coffee
and
chocolate
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
like
other
beers
in
their
lineup
but
its
a
well
made
beer
taste
is
well
done
typical
founders
deliciousness
coffee
rye
bread
bakers
chocolate
and
light
redgrape
fruitiness
it
would
seem
this
beer
would
be
better
fresh
but
this
still
is
pretty
damn
tasty
mouthfeel
and
body
are
about
medium
and
the
beer
displays
very
little
sweetness
my
12
oz
bottle
is
disappearing
very
fast
so
drinkability
must
be
pretty
high
quite
enjoyable
but
its
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
whats
really
going
on
here
i
guess
the
only
style
that
can
sum
this
up
is
the
generic
term
rye
beer
its
an
excellent
one
for
sure
pours
black
with
at
least
2
fingers
of
head
smell
some
cocoa
and
chocolate
taste
chocolate
rye
and
a
bitter
finish
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
i
could
only
drink
a
few
of
these
split
with
friends
but
very
delicious
d
i
think
this
has
held
up
with
time
flavors
are
still
crisp
and
clean
for
the
most
part
i
have
a
bottle
or
two
left
and
will
be
saving
on
to
them
for
a
little
while
longer
would
suggest
you
start
to
drink
this
now
as
i
see
it
at
its
prime
now
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thinner
head
than
i
expected
smell
is
of
sour
dough
bread
pineaples
and
coffee
this
has
a
very
rich
and
interesting
flavor
sour
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
with
a
noticable
alcahol
aftertaste
ive
had
beers
with
a
much
higher
abv
that
do
not
show
their
boozy
side
as
much
as
this
one
roasted
malty
coffee
flavors
remind
me
of
a
warm
porter
again
the
tangy
spicy
sourness
from
the
rye
comes
out
ive
recently
become
interested
in
rye
beers
im
not
sure
if
i
know
exactly
how
to
appreciate
what
a
great
one
is
supposed
to
be
like
this
was
an
intersting
beer
with
very
complex
flavors
i
cant
say
i
really
loved
those
flavors
overall
so
damn
solid
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
founders
for
sure
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
would
like
to
try
this
when
the
dry
hopping
is
a
little
stronger
i
believe
founders
last
brewed
this
black
beauty
over
2
years
ago
so
that
means
the
bottle
i
was
drinking
was
at
least
that
old
and
im
betting
closer
to
3
years
or
more
regardless
age
has
changed
black
rye
into
another
beast
or
should
i
say
another
tasty
beast
id
love
to
see
founders
get
back
to
brewing
this
theres
a
lot
of
people
out
there
that
should
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
fantastic
beer
d
delicious
definitely
could
keep
coming
back
for
more
if
this
thing
wasnt
so
damn
hard
to
pour
a
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
drainpour
easy
drinking
very
nice
take
on
a
style
that
getting
more
popular
despite
the
rough
start
this
was
a
nice
beer
nice
black

a

one
of
my
top
3
favs
easily
d
this
is
remarkably
drinkable
but
given
that
it
will
be
the
only
one
ill
be
drinking
this
year
im
savoring
it
thanks
again
joe
drinkablity
was
quite
good
for
better
or
worse
there
was
a
lot
of
good
competition
very
easy
drinking
with
a
great
mix
of
flavors
d
two
of
these
would
be
nice
another
good
release
from
founders
not
their
best
but
certainly
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
my
trip
to
grand
rapids
to
check
this
brewery
out
in
person
great
brew
here
poured
much
darker
than
i
expected
enormous
medium
tan
head
with
lots
of
good
lacing
mild
aroma
slightly
sharp
and
bitter
scents
of
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
caramel
creamy
and
thick
to
the
mouth
good
feel
to
this
flavor
resembles
a
light
porter
or
sweet
stout
nice
bitter
hop
flavor
with
a
sharp
graininess
which
could
be
the
rye
this
is
my
first
rye
brew
and
what
a
great
one
indeed
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
cant
find
any
light
passing
through
the
blackness
with
a
lingering
tan
head
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
are
inviting
but
then
a
swallow
reveals
bittersweet
chocolate
theres
tanginess
from
the
rye
and
some
citrusy
hop
goodness
what
a
mixits
like
chocolate
covered
hops
delicious
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
so
you
get
a
lot
of
flavor
that
doesnt
weigh
you
down
not
sure
that
id
want
to
drink
more
than
maybe
a
couple
of
these
but
one
is
really
enjoyable
md
smooth
strong
flavors
and
very
consistent
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
without
the
heavy
feel
definitely
recommended
a
wonderful
floral
aroma
with
a
pitch
black
pour
and
a
nice
tan
head
exquisite
taste
of
chocolate
caramel
coffee
and
nutty
with
a
bittersweet
tingle
to
the
palate
smells
awesome
tastes
great
and
is
a
very
good
beer
if
you
can
get
it
then
fricken
get
i
a
little
too
much
rye
to
have
more
than
a
couple
of
for
me
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
cant
wait
for
founders
arrival
here
in
nc
this
will
be
part
of
my
regular
rotation
thanks
davideddie
for
the
wonderful
extra
mouthfeel
was
light
yet
creamy
carbonation
lends
a
nice
fizziness
to
this
beer
the
body
was
slightly
heavy
and
the
carbonation
as
well
as
the
sticky
foam
made
it
a
nice
thick
drink
even
though
it
had
an
unimpressive
abv
it
was
moderately
warming
i
found
this
rye
to
be
very
drinkable
the
character
of
the
rye
and
roasted
malts
makes
this
a
nice
beer
for
the
winter
season
pours
to
a
attractive
black
body
with
decent
carbonation
showing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
in
the
head
head
is
a
rocky
deep
tan
with
nice
retention
nose
is
wonderful
with
a
mingling
of
smokey
malt
and
spicey
hops
really
gets
the
mouth
watering
flavor
is
a
little
thinner
than
the
nose
would
have
led
you
to
expect
does
have
a
solid
burnt
malt
character
followed
by
a
even
dry
bitter
feel
that
rounds
out
the
mouthfeel
maybe
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
nicely
drinkable
and
quite
complex
the
style
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
mouthfeel
really
hurts
it
ill
try
it
again
to
see
if
i
like
it
better
opened
with
a
pop
poured
a
deep
black
with
an
off
white
head
lots
of
roasted
barley
and
citrusy
hops
in
aroma
also
some
chocolate
aggressive
roastedpatent
malt
bitterness
some
tangieness
from
the
rye
long
dry
finish
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
love
the
mouthfeel
of
rye
beers
a
little
dry
and
grainy
a
bit
of
red
grape
skin
after
taste
pours
a
thick
black
color
with
a
generous
amount
of
foamy
and
frothy
rich
brown
head
bubbled
up
almost
over
the
rim
of
my
glass
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
of
rich
dark
roasty
malt
with
a
vine
type
grape
aroma
taste
is
sweet
at
first
followed
by
a
hoppy
bittering
mouthfeeling
is
very
flat
allowing
for
the
flavor
to
really
dominate
and
that
is
mostly
the
rye
brownish
black
in
appearance
thick
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
and
coffee
tastes
of
chocolate
roasted
coffee
burnt
toast
mild
pine
dark
rye
bread
and
some
tangy
citrus
finishes
kind
of
crisp
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
slightly
thick
drinkability
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
reminds
me
of
a
spicyhoppy
porter
recommended
pours
an
almost
black
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
very
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
could
use
some
help
in
this
department
the
nose
of
this
one
is
probably
the
best
characteristic
of
this
beer
theres
a
wonderful
explosion
of
fresh
grassy
rye
and
dark
smokey
chocolate
fresh
ground
coffee
with
a
subtle
citrus
hop
bite
in
a
way
i
could
find
people
really
disliking
this
smell
but
i
find
it
complex
and
very
appealing
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
fresh
burst
of
citrus
up
front
with
a
chocolate
and
carmel
malt
undertone
toasted
rye
flavors
are
presesnt
from
start
to
finish
which
gives
this
beer
a
very
unique
and
crisp
bite
aftertaste
is
somewhat
dry
and
clean
with
a
fairly
bitter
feel
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
carbonation
i
just
recently
had
bells
rye
stout
and
find
these
two
beers
to
be
fairly
similar
in
taste
bells
was
more
creamy
and
founders
has
more
of
a
bite
another
solid
brew
from
founders
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
a
huge
stiff
tan
head
a
good
amount
of
lacing
as
the
rocky
foam
drapes
and
fades
the
first
mouth
full
through
the
beast
is
creamy
and
full
bodied
initially
you
can
enjoy
a
chocolaty
aroma
from
about
a
foot
away
from
this
one
as
the
head
subsides
the
rye
character
sneaks
out
from
beneath
the
cocoa
full
flavored
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
nose
a
hoppy
finish
balances
the
malts
out
nicely
at
6
6
abv
this
one
is
real
nice
drinker
been
looking
forward
to
trying
it
for
a
while
thanks
dave
d
mild
accessible
and
pleasant
i
would
probably
have
one
with
a
flavorful
dinner
next
time
rather
than
an
after
dinner
drink
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
with
a
steak
and
blue
chess
salad
d
if
this
beer
is
always
this
carbonated
i
would
not
drink
another
but
if
i
simply
have
a
bad
bottle
i
would
certainly
be
willing
to
give
it
another
try
i
enjoyed
the
porteresque
smell
and
flavor
though
i
was
hardpressed
to
find
any
contribution
of
the
rye
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
on
my
sabl
glass
the
aroma
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
a
stout
but
also
has
shades
of
smores
being
cooked
over
a
campfire
there
was
an
abundance
of
roastiness
in
the
flavor
but
not
quite
what
you
would
find
in
a
stout
more
like
toasted
rye
bread
than
roasted
barley
bitter
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
linger
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
amount
of
carbonation
but
nothing
too
aggressive
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
dark
beers
ive
ever
had
clearly
not
one
to
fall
into
either
the
porter
or
stout
classification
i
truly
enjoy
this
beer
as
well
as
their
reds
rye
and
i
cannot
wait
until
founders
becomes
available
in
north
carolina
early
next
year
thanks
to
demcorhip
for
the
bottle
the
aroma
reveals
a
biscuity
malt
backbone
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
foresty
hops
and
toffee
the
taste
blasts
off
with
a
huge
roast
coffee
malt
note
acrid
as
hell
and
lingering
for
what
seems
like
an
eternity
some
smoother
milk
chocolate
and
hops
blend
into
the
background
lovin
it
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
viscous
with
again
a
huge
bitter
java
bite
to
the
finish
this
beer
is
good
if
not
very
good
but
its
a
bit
much
to
be
able
to
stomach
more
than
one
per
setting
nevertheless
its
one
ill
be
looking
forward
to
trying
again
soon
got
this
one
cause
i
was
so
impressed
with
the
reds
rye
this
one
was
also
very
good
although
maybe
not
at
quite
the
same
level
great
sphit
when
the
bottle
opens
something
crazy
in
the
pour
of
this
whole
sixer
huge
4
tan
head
frothy
if
a
little
excessive
beer
is
mahogany
with
nice
red
highlights
looks
great
and
ill
blame
the
giant
head
on
mishandling
nose
is
crazy
spicy
malt
turns
more
roasted
as
it
continues
molasses
some
light
dried
fruit
taste
is
much
more
roasted
than
the
nose
spices
go
strong
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
some
bittering
hopes
at
the
back
end
and
in
the
fairly
short
aftertaste
no
real
sweetness
to
this
one
too
carbonated
and
fizzy
although
the
bodys
good
a
tasty
brew
although
ill
probably
stick
with
the
more
plentiful
reds
wow
this
beer
is
carbonated
a
deep
black
beer
with
a
huge
head
so
much
in
fact
that
there
was
more
head
than
beer
as
i
poured
it
has
finally
settled
and
there
is
a
half
inch
atop
the
brew
the
smell
is
oatmeal
coffee
this
is
the
first
rye
beer
i
have
seen
that
is
this
dark
the
taste
is
like
a
nice
porter
roasted
flavors
abound
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
ths
carbonation
really
makes
the
beer
foam
up
the
drinkability
is
good
i
could
certainly
go
for
this
again
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
made
a
huge
pillowy
cloud
of
a
head
over
a
pitch
black
liquid
the
aroma
is
hoppy
the
label
states
dry
hopped
and
a
little
stouty
maybe
the
rye
gives
that
smell
with
chocolate
undertones
the
taste
is
not
unlike
storm
king
kind
of
like
a
hoppy
russian
imperial
stout
very
nice
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
beer
overall
quite
good
and
refreshingly
different
i
have
bought
some
more
so
i
can
try
this
a
few
more
times
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
wish
i
had
grabbed
a
six
pack
opposed
to
one
for
me
and
the
sudsdog
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
packed
with
flavor
it
is
another
great
brew
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
founders
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
to
highly
carbonated
for
my
tastes
at
first
but
seems
to
get
better
after
a
bit
this
beer
is
fairly
complex
and
the
taste
allows
it
to
go
down
pretty
easily
a
good
dark
beer
when
you
want
something
a
bit
roasty
this
is
so
well
constructed
it
held
up
for
a
year
without
any
significantly
noticeable
changes
d
ive
only
had
2
beers
from
this
brewery
the
reds
rye
and
the
black
both
are
outstanding
i
like
the
red
a
little
better
but
this
is
a
great
beer
i
just
wish
that
founders
distributed
to
california
but
that
is
wishful
thinking
exceptionally
smooth
and
easy
to
put
down
well
balanced
with
a
semidry
finish
highly
recommended
founders
comes
through
with
another
winner
this
beer
is
so
unique
and
delicious
i
cant
wait
to
drink
another
the
brewers
at
founders
are
some
of
the
best
in
the
country
at
brewing
so
many
different
styles
everyone
of
them
excellent
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
bold
flavors
will
deter
many
less
adventurous
drinkers
a
shame
but
true
fans
of
porters
and
spiced
hops
will
be
fans
of
this
one
cheers
d
i
had
this
one
in

like
to
try
in

toasted

even
some

the

of

comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
flavors
of
roasted
coffee
oatmeal
bitterness
of

around
the

of
the
glass
a
thin
fizzy
head
lasted
for
a

moments
then
faded
into
a

lingering
bubbles
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
nuts
and
a
bit
of
light
piney
hops
sitting
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
slightly
biting
and
bitter
at
the
start
then
it
was
followed
up
by
some
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
that
lingered

was
lightly
carbonated

this
was
a
pretty
good

notes

had
my
first
one
from
founders
looking
forward
to
trying
others
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
a
few
of
but
personally
id
have
be
in
the
mood
for
it
in
order
to
select
it
however
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
jet
black
into
my
glass
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
when
held
to
a
bright
light
there
is
a
very
deep
ruby
hue
the
head
diminished
to
a
skim
coating
but
offered
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
moderately
roasty
fairly
chocolately
and
there
is
a
moderatelow
spicy
and
citrusy
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
rather
complex
a
medium
roastedburnt
malt
note
is
delivered
upfront
followed
by
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
moderatehigh
hop
flavor
the
finish
is
rather
smooth
and
has
a
crisp
dry
rye
character
with
a
pleasant
hint
of
roast
and
hop
flavor
lingering
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
medium
and
body
is
medium

overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
was
nice
to
see
the
hop
aroma
shine
along
side
the
roastedchocolate
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
very
well
done
a
solid
alternative
to
your
typical
porter
or
stout
founders
black
rye
pours
a
beautiful
inky
black
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
a
delcious
mix
of
dark
toasty
malts
almost
toasty
and
citrusy
centennial
hops
the
rye
character
is
much
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
and
it
works
really
well
with
the
dark
malts
the
hop
flavor
really
goes
great
with
the
black
malts
im
really
surprised
at
how
well
it
works
i
really
hope
founders
is
more
available
on
the
east
coast
soon
pours
a
great
head
that
retains
well
with
a
good

color
is

edges
the
smell
is
nice
and
roasty
with
a
light
chocolatey
smell
coming
through
it
also
has
a
lot
of
hoppy
smell
coming
through
the
flavor
is
really
chocoalatey
with
some
earthy
roastiness
i
really
enjoy
this
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
well
and
a
little
crisp
but
the
flavor
is
just
like
putting
a
handfull
of
black
roasty
coffee
malts
in
your
mouth
and
just
chewing
i
love
it
overall
i
will
have
this
again
and
hope
to
have
lots
of
it
this
dark
black
unfilted

perfectly
defintely
serve
this
beer
on
the
warm
side
as
it
bring
forth
all
the
glorious
roasted
flavor
of
this
brew
i
found
it
to
be
big
coffee
taste
that
morphs
into
a
dry
chocolate
nuttyness
the
finish
is
a
real
dryness
that
for
my
taste
lingers
just
a
little
too
long
but
did
leave
me
wanting
that
next
sip
black
rye
may
not
be
the
best
of
founder
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
but
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
a
small
very
interesting
brewery
this
is
one
extremely
drinkable
beer
founders
knows
how
to
make
rye
beers
thats
for
sure
highly
recommended
this
beer
was
impressive
in
all
aspects
even
though
it
is
labeled
as
a
rye
beer
it
closely
resembles
an
american
stout
and
would
be
able
to
compete
with

can
say
that
this
is
definately
interesting
im
not
too
sure
how
well
the
often
burnt
flavors
meld
with
the
citrusy
punch
of
the
hops
just
there
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
i
came
to
enjoy
rye
beers
through
some
of
the
rye
ipas
out
there
i
think
the
hoppier
beers
accent
the
rye
better
than
the
extra
malt
in
this
beer

5an
outstanding
winter
drinker
to
have
on
hand
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
lace
is
weblike
with
some
bright
red
wine
highlights
an
evaporating
tan
head
the
nose
is
subtle
an
incredible
winter
seasonal
hints
of
caramel
but
surprisingly
light
but
i
would
call
this
an
imperial
stout
because
im
not
getting
much
rye
besides
from
suggestion
yeah
onions
muddled
aroma
of
nutella
and
a
sort
of
pale
ale
citric
quality
a
certain
milky
quality
to
it
chocolatey
more
hops
i
appreciated
the
crispness
of
it
all
during
the
first
bottle
o
a
tasty
ipa
with
more
citrus
than
spice
for
a
rye
here
the
rye
seems
to
have
affected
the
brew
more
by
adding
body
rather
than
spiciness
which
is
fine
considering
the
more
evident
dominance
of
hops
substantial
and
enjoyable
for
a
rye
based
ipa
this
one
is
exceptional
looks
great
smell
is
subtle
citrus
aroma
taste
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
very
complex
for
an
ipa
to
explain
the
ryegrain
is
noticable
up
front
then
it
gives
way
to
a
citrusy
hoppiness
and
finishes
very
sweet
and
smooth
without
much
bitterness
at
all
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
rye
ipas
ive
had
to
date
excellent
rye
is
very
prevalent
in
a
good
way
smutty

bill
is
still
very
much

earthy
but
very
drinkable
taste
is
similar
firm
rye
spiciness
backed
by
hops
and
a
surprising
residual
sweetness
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
im
surprised
to
see
the
notes
indicating
it
was
mashed
lower
than
finest
kind
ipa
otherwise
a
nice
balance
between
the
rye
and
hops
firm

in
the

def
a

i
also
love
that
they
actually
give
all

is
pretty

this

how
about
that
gobbledygook
our
rhye
ipa
bulls
its
way
into
our
lineup
because
we
love
really
hoppy
beers
and
were
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
play
with
rye
malt
and
add
a
big
boatload
of
hops
would
a
rhino
enjoy
the
big
flavor
we
dont
know
but
let
us
know
if
you
found

a

this
beer
was
decent
but
the
rye
malt
wasnt
spicy
enough
and
the
hops
were
to
bitter
for
my
tastes
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
golden

with

massive
fine

that
continued

pouring

great
creamy
body
and
the
head
is
so
thick
and
substancial
it
was
was
like
whipped
cream
a
very
nice
rye
ipa
that
leans
more
towards
the
citrus
ipa
end
of
the
taste
spectrum
with
the
rye
adding
nice
spicy
tart
notes
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
and
if
smuttynose
was
available
here
id
get
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
and
thats
saying
a
lot
because
local
ruebens
brews
is
making
world
class
rye
beer
a
few
miles
from
here
o
everything
i
expect
from
the
style
and
from
smutty
absolutely
delicious
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
d
this
was
a
decent
rye
ipa
but
the
scent
and
taste
werent
anything
special
and
the
body
was
weak
the
finish
was
smooth
enough
so
at
least
it
was
easy
to
drink
dont
feel
bad
if
you
never
try
this
one
o
a
solid
beer
overall
though
a
bit
too
bitter
id
like
the
hops
to
stick
out
a
bit
more
as
well
big
on
flavor
but
light
in
body
the
beer
covers
a
lot
of
ground
because
of
its
sheer
complexity
fruit
spice
grain
sweet
bitter
bread
and
pepper
are
all
represented
in
exact
proportion
where
its
rustic
nature
is
celebrated
because
its
a
part
of
the
complexity
it
also
distracts
from
the
smooth
hop
bitterness
aggressive
i
like
it
nice
big
head
of
around
three
fingers
very
even
surface
even
with
a
full
spectrum
of
bubble
sizes
dark
eggshell
white
in
color
nice
retention
plus
the
lacing
is
quite
thick
and
sticks
like
glue
the
liquid
itself
is
a
paler
orange
to
yellow
gold
has
a
sort
of
metallic
sheen
to
it
fully
transparent
and
shiny
with
extra
tiny
bubbles
rising
quickly
within
the
nose
comes
on
first
with
tangy
white
grapefruit
to
mandarin
orange
notes
followed
closely
by
dried
grass
and
hay
and
then
veers
into
cocoa
powder
and
flowers
minimal
breadiness
but
whats
there
is
country
style
very
light
pineapple
peach
to
nectarine
fruit
scents
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
seems
creamier
through
the
mouth
entry
but
afterwards
tends
to
prickle
in
support
of
the
bitter
herbaceousness
and
hoppiness
peppery
with
some
saltiness
too
any
pine
or
flowers
come
across
as
dried
in
nature
that
said
theres
juice
in
the
sour
orange
to
lemon
citrus
the
rye
clearer
here
and
helps
fill
the
blank

the
spotty
mixed
white

component
minor
maltiness
peeks
out
by
the
end
cocoa
and
caramel
no
alcoholic
heat
but
it
is
fairly
intensely
bitter
which
can
create
a
similar
impression
just
seems
attenuated
and
lacking
in
volume
and

weight
especially
at
the
end
yep
light
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
heavy

left

fresh
citrus

aromas
fresh
pine
in
the
background
and
a
pleasant

with
aggressive
but
soft
carbonation
and
a
tangy
feel
from
the
middle
to
the
end
citrus
hoppiness
up

followed
by
spicy
rye
malt
through
the
middle
that
transitions
to
light
pine

bitterness
to
the
finish
citrus

flavors
up

that
are
quickly
subdues

spicy
rye
maltiness
rye
flavors
are
strong
through
the
middle
until
light
pine
hop
bitterness
takes
a
bite
at
the
finish
this
is
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
that
ive
had
the
rye
malt
aromas
and
flavors
are
the
spotlight
never
outdone
by
accompanying
malt
and
hop
characteristics
appears
to
be
muddied

with
a
gold

yeast
poured

it

something
decaying

rye
aromas

flavors
match
complimentary
rye
and

bitterness
that
lingers
pine
resin

earthy
too
mouthfeel
is
pretty
spectacularly
tingly
fluid
and
foamy
the
bitterness
continues
to
push
on
through
perhaps
a
little
tooo
bitter
but
overall
yay
smuttynose
solid
golden
orange
with
a
bit
of
haze
with
a
thick
lumpy
white
head
that
sticks
to
the

fairly
subtle
floral
soapy
and
oily
citrus
aromas
more
spiciness
as
it
warms
up
citrus
pulp
some
piney
resin
yeast
and
a
pleasant
addition
of
spicy
grain
in
the
finish
mediumfullish
body
with
a
nice
creaminess
before
a
dry
bitterness
wraps
it
up
some
sweet
toasted
almost
biscuity
notes
but
the
bitterness
all
but
buries
it
pretty
good
not
sure
how
old
the
bottle
is
lots
of
bitter
spicy
qualities
but
id
love
a
little
more
diversity
in
hop
flavors
and
less
plain
old
aggressiveness
my
conclusion
is
somewhat
confused
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
just
didnt
do
anything
well
almost
tasting
like
an
6
month
old
ipa
maybe
it
was
i
dont
know
because
the
only
dating
was
the
notch
under
2013
but
i
wont
visit
this
one
again
d
good
one
to
try
attention
brewers
this
is
how
you
marry
rye
with
hops
theyre
beautifully
balanced
aggressive
tasty
as
all
hell
an
excellent
work
of
art
o
excellent
example
of
a
ryed
ipa
i
may
buy
this
one
again
overall
pretty
solid
rye
ipa
from
the
portsmouth
boys
god
to
see
thus
is
a
year
round
offering
i
was
on
the
fence
initially
but
i
love
the
mixture
of
big
bold
hops
and
spicy
rye
really
good
as
usual
from
smuttynose
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
bold
and
a
worthy
purchase
if
you
love
rye
beers
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
more
often
o
6

for
a
worldclass
rye
beer
gimee
gimee
gimee
o
a
little

ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
you
want
something
slightly
different
a
zesty
little
number
packed
and
wellbalanced
with
warm
soothing
grains
with
hints
of
citrus
fruits
in
the
aroma
and
finishing
with
a
pleasingly
biting
spiciness
and
hop
bitterness
a
nice
spicy
rye
malt
ipa
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
good
complexity
the
good
part
is
this
is
hugely
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
great
quaff
with
modest
bitterness
and
tangy
gulpability
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
olive
tree
market
in
ocean
beach
o
a
solid
ipa
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sierra
nevadas
torpedo
which
is
most
definitely
a
compliment
the
balance
in
this
beer
comes
through
to
create
a
meshwork
of
interconnected
flavors
so
while
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
complex
its
certainly
a
rich
palatable
brew
this
beer
was
a
huge
disappointment
it
had
very
little
hoppiness
and
not
a
lot
going
on
at
all
really
this
was
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
thus
one
doesnt
have
me
clamoring
for
more
of
their
beers
this
beer
has
pretty
good
reviews
on
this
site
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
aroma
was
weak
and
flavor
was
the
same
very
subtle
for
an
ipa
not
how
i
like
my
ipas
at
all
not
a
fan
of
rye
not
a
fan
of
bitter
but
the
hop
character
is
nice
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
my
style
o
overall
this
is
a
great
variation
on
rye
beeripas
the
beer
comes
of
as
hoppy
yet
still
easy
to
drink
very
nice
work
to
smutty
again
i
hope
to
find
this
ontapnext
time
i
go
to
the
store
in
all
catagories
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
the
hybrid
ryeipa
style
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
slight
rye
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
citrus
forward
hop
presence
but
the
rye
aspect
is
quite
subdued
in
my
opinion
on
tap
as
a
guest
beer
at
amherst
brewing
this
pours
a
greyish
shade
of
light
brown
funny
looking
and
cloudy
with
only
minimal
white
soapy
head
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
rye
more
bready
than
spicy
but
robust
nevertheless
also
well
hopped
dry
hopped
obviously
with
some
residual
oil
and
bitterness
to
boot
the
taste
is
actually
lighter
on
the
rye
malt
than
the
smell
it
just
accentuates
the
other
malts
the
hops
are
real
aggressive
plentiful
and
bitter
more
than
anything
else
i
get
some
high
alpha
varietals
but
i
also
get
some
more
subtle
english
stuff
it
really
works
light
and
delicate
for
a
rye
beer
because
of
the
grain
it
drinks
easy
and
the
higher
alcohol
is
well
disguised
nice
in
the
early
fall
smuttynose
continues
to
impress
me
rye
beer
is
boom
or
bust
most
of
the
time
and
this
falls
on
the
right
side
of
that
for
sure
othe
ipa
part
of
the
beer
was
spot
on
the
rye
part
wasnt
more
rye
to
help
out
the
balance
and
the
beer
would
improve
greatly
oda
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
bouquet
here
pretty
complex
in
my
view
love
the
label
too
the
taste
has
an
full
floral
and
citrus
taste
but
it
is
not
overly
bitter
it
is
moderately
bitter
and
the
bitterness
ends
dry
and
lingers
briefly
on
the
tail
end
but
it
is
not
overly
so
a
great
variation
on
the
rye
ipa
style
t
pine
under
a
blanket
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
flavors
spicy
rye
near
the
middle
with
a
good
amount
of
bready
malt
the
peppery
rye
shows
up
on
the
finish
with
some
light
pine
resin
a
really
solid
beer
this
is
a
solid
rye
ipa
fans
of
finestkind
will
like
this
one
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
decent
but
the
craftsmanship
is
what
really
sells
this
beer
for
me
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
spice
and
sweet
malt
backbone
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
rye
is
very
prominent
with
a
nice
spicy
zesty
flavor
that
nicely
compliments
the
dry
earthy
bitterness
of
the
hops
hop
profile
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
still
has
nice
flavor
the
malt
backbone
is
huge
much
stronger
than
i
prefer
lots
of
caramel
biscuit
and
toffee
good
for
balance
and
blends
well
with
the
rye
but
it
takes
away
from
the
hop
flavor
a
bit
too
much
for
my
preference
still
this
beer
is
very
dry
and
bitter
with
spicy
grassy
hops
and
dank
pine
needle
character
overall
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
again
o
overall
a
decent
dipa
some
nice
citrus
hops
throughout
and
definite

checking

buy
this

well
as
the

go
along
with
the
great
balance
great
value
as
always
from
the
smutty
bbs
so
definitely
worth
trying
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
rye
beer
because
it
was
very
bold
and
spicy
yet
remained
drinkable
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
noticeable
in
the
taste
oi
like
this
more
as
it
warms
a
nice
mash
up
of

a
slightly

color
with

and
almost
completely
hidden

bready

flavor
is
spicy

just
a

excellent
rye
beer
hope
to
find
it
on
tap
as
well
taste
has
a
bit
of
toasty
malt
sweetness
to
start
but
then
shifts
gears
quickly
the
rye
spiciness
is
right
up
front
and
the
hopping
is
solid
it
has
a
good
background
of
resiny
citrus
with
a
hint
of
pithiness
added
for
good
measure
but
the
rye
still
sticks
around
to
the
finish
which
tends
towards
the
dry
side
quite
nice
indeed
nice

with
caramel

and
then
went
extremely
bitter
making
it
not

drinkable
maybe
if
i
aged
it
for
some
months

years
the
bitterness
will
go

and
it
would
be

i
still
love
ninkasi
one
of
my
favorite

serving
type
bottle
this
beer
is
a
mess
i
know
rye
is
difficult
to
work
with
but
offer
a
better
product
wasted
5

on
this
drain
pour
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
but
its
still
quite
good
as
long
as
you
keep
an
open
mind
and
dont
let
your
expectations
guide
you
i
think
you
will
like
the
journey
i
got
lots
of
dark
fruit
toffee
brown
sugar
bark
burnt
malt
mouthfeel
and
body
were
a
bit
thin
spice
apparent
on
the
aftertaste
but
not
much
rye
in
the
mix
flavorwise
overall
definitely
worth
a
try
a
quite
well
done
rye
beer
tasty
unique
flavor
without
becoming
too
much
a
lot
less
flavor
than
you
would
expect
from
an
imperial
rye
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
maybe
a
bad
bottle
some
may
find
this
overly
sweet
the
right
at
beer
at
the
right
time
can
make
all
the
difference
i
can
sort
of
get
the
roggenbier
comparison
amazingly
clear
for
a
dark
beer
a
nice
tan
head
led
to
lacing
that
clung
the
entire
glass
mild
malty
smell
the
rye
didnt
really
standout
great
caramel
taste
malty
taste
but
a
bit
thin
body
good
residual
bitterness
a
nice
special
release
overall
i
am
pleased
with
this
brew
and
cant
wait
to
see
what
new
stuff
they
come
out
with
devil
went
down
to
oregon
is
a
surprise
that
most
beer
geeks
will
appreciate
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
isnt
quite
the
sum
of
its
parts
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
not
terribly
impressed
and
will
be
unlikely
to
try
it
again
its
a
quality
brew
but
i
wish
the
rye
came
out
more
this
is
an
interesting
brew
its
malty
but
the
rye
adds
that
sharp
edge
not
as
spicy
as
many
rye
brews
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
whole
foods
in
portland
pearl
district
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
west
coast
love
from
this
brew
which
is
fairly
indicative
of
this
brewer
as
a
whole
but
at
least
theres
an
excuse
this
time
a
generally
agreeable
offering
overall
i
suppose
but
the
particular
grainy
maltiness
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
any
and
everything
else
next

this

a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
brew
that
i
would

again
if
the
opportunity
presented

i

this

overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
two
well
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
in
philly
d
this
was
my
favorite
beer
of
the
night
it
was
so
balanced
and
fresh
tasting
that
my
tastebuds
were
pleased
with
each
sip
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
dock
street
get
it
when
in
philly
found
at
the
jet
bar
on
terminal
d
at
philadelphia
airport
this
shows
a
yellow
brown
color
a
cloudy
iced
tea
appearance
with
a
whispy
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
detects
crisp
citrus
hops
lemonorange
and
bready
caramel
sweetness
in
the
background
quite
tempting
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
sturdy
woodsy
grain
mixed
well
with
the
citrus
bite
carbonation
is
modest
but
arguably
adequate
with
a
supple
near
chewy
feel
in
a
solidly
midbody
brew
this
is
not
highly
rye
flavored
by
my
definition
of
rye
as
in
bread
but
it
is
a
breadygrainy
ipa
and
is
very
agreeable
and
equally
drinkable
this
has
some
flavor
balls
with
plenty
of
bitterness
but
an
unusually
strong
grain
character
is
it
rye
a
bit
id
like
more
of
a
rye
definition
in
this
but
no
real
complaints
here
its
a
fairly
unique
quality
ipa
with
a
rye
idea
good
job
dock

this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
smooth

with

combination
this
is
a
nice

sipper
at
7
should
have
picked
up
a
growler
of
this
guy
as
it
was
very
enjoyable
had
this
on

then
the
rye
hits
hard
almost
overpowering
rye
not
as
balanced
as
hop
rod
rye
or
reds
rye
but
still
quite
good
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
sipping
led
to
more
sipping
and
i
was
ready
to
order
another
when
it
was
finished
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
next
time
i
have
the
chance
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
rye
ipa
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
from
dock
street
the
hops
in
this
ipa
really
sings
piney
citrusy
and
hearty
the
rye
adds
an
acuity
and
acidity
that
perfectly
accentuates
the
grapefruit
and
resinous
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
carbonation
is
very
pleasant
huge
hoppy
bitter
spicy
mouthfeel
with
great
drinkability
pours
a
hazed
dark
copper
with
small
cap
of
frothy
white
head
diminishing
quickly
but
decent
lacing
scent
is
of
bright
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
as
well
a
nice
backbone
of
sweet
and
only
mildy
spice
taste
brings
the
tropical
and
floral
hops
with
touches
of
citrus
and
pine
bitter
at
first
but
cut
by
a
grahm
crackery
sweet
background
the
rye
doesnt
contribute
much
spice
but
instead
gives
some
body
and
grainyness
to
the
medium
bodied
brew
a
decent
ipa
malt
forward
d
one
was
enough
a
nice
amberchestnut
color
with
a
frothy
white
one
finger
head
aroma
of
pine
rye
of
course
and
malt
a
little
sweet
slight
flavor
of
honey
although
not
sticky
the
malt
adds
a
bit
of
chewiness
to
the
beer
not
overpoweringly
hoppy
fairly
well
balanced
still
if
hop
devil
werent
available
id
drink
more
of
this
next
time
im
in
philly
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
hides
the
alcohol
content
well
making
it
all
the
easier
to
drink
a
few
not
a
bad
ipa
by
any
means
but
the
rye
should
have
given
it
just
a
bit
more
bite
overall
the
general
impression
was
a
bit
darker
than
ususal
midrange
ipa
the
level
of
hopping
was
nicely
done
and
did
not
overwhelm
the
malt
but
i
was
looking
for
just
a
bit
more
distinction
enjoyable
but
not
particulary
memorable
slightly
chewy
medium
body
that
is
on
the
fuller
end
of
the
spectrum
pretty
hop
forward
with
a
decent
amount
of
dry
earthy
piny
hops
subtle
citrus
peel
presence
sweet
caramel
malt
and
prominent
rye
flavor
this
beer
is
excellently
balanced
and
although
the
malt
backbone
and
rye
are
prominent
they
dont
overpower
the
hops
allowing
the
sweet
citrus
and
dry
pine
notes
to
shine
through
the
sweetness
from
the
caramel
malt
and
rye
actually
enhance
these
flavors
and
the
balance
makes
this
beer
very
quaffable
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
highly
recommended
if
fresh
i
had
to
come
home
from
school
for
an
appointment
i
spent
the
night
at
home
hanging
out
with
my
dad
listening
to
some
great
music
and
drinking
some
great
beer
i
had
absolutely
no
problem
polishing
off
a
growler
of
this
delicious
beer
pours
hazy
opaque
copper
with
sticky
head
aroma
is
fresh
and
hoppy
thick
with
simcoe
hops
flavor
is
carmelly
and
sweet
citrusy
heavy
with
what
seem
to
be
simcoe
hops
mouthfeel
is
viscous
and
clingy
overall
quite
tasty
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
overpowering
but
the
creamy
malt
makes
up
for
it
d
i
really
wish
hope
the
bottle
this
beer
very
easy
and
inviting
to
drink
but
has
enough
character
to
make
it
stick
out
d
a
bit
higher
than
sessionable
but
the
taste
makes
it
good
for
a
few
imo
ive
had
a
few
rye
beers
in
my
time
but
this
is
in
the
top
five
and
i
was
quite
impressed
heres
to
hoping
that
dock
street
can
keep
up
this
pace
and
pumping
out
some
good
brews
overall
this
was
a
very
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
ipa
and
i
am
very
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
track
it
down
first
taste
wow
you
get
a
great
taste
of
the
rye
it
sort
of
disappears
quickly
after
it
hits
your
mouth
with
a
fresh
train
of
hops
coming
right
behind
it
in
the
end
it
balances
extremely
well
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
as
you
drink
more
it
becomes
a
bit
creamier
nice
beer
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
ipa
that
takes
you
away
from
the
norm
today
easy
to
consume
and
very
flavorful
so
you
will
not
grow
tired
of
this
at
all
had
this
on
draught
whilst
waiting
at
the
philly
airport
lovely
off
white
head
transparent
brown
rye
and
hop
aroma
nice
perfectly
subtle
sweet
and
bitter
hoprye
very
good
ends
bitterly
sort
of
on
the
thin
side
but
still
ok
a
good
drinker
not
too
heavy
and
very
flavorful
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
this
is
really
more
of
just
a
plain
rye
beer
then
a
rye
ipa
by
my
albeit
incredibly
jaded
portland
standards
still
a
sturdy
beer
that
goes
down
with
ease
assume
you
like
the
spiciness
of
rye
drink
yes
very
good
incredibly
refreshing
crisp
and
slightly
dry
dgood
stuff
the
20
rye
bill
really
gives
it
a
sharp
crispness
and
pleasant
drying
feel
nice
job
in
using
ingredients
to
compliment
each
other
if
you
find
it
try
it
hv
d
i
had
two
of
these
and
would
have
loved
several
more
perfect
example
of
the
style
d
man
this
is
a
tasty
ipa
that
is
extremely
fresh
and
flavorful
very
pleased
with
this
one
not
only
for
its
wellbalanced
flavor
and
intoxicating
aroma
but
also
its
drinkability
nice
job
dock
street
mouthfeel
is
kinda
big
but
well
balanced
drinkability
is
good
but
again
this
is
a
big
feeling
beer
a
nice
tasty
that
you
can
have
one
or
two
of
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
grainy
bitter
fruity
and
zesty
wawaweewa
to
call
this
beer
a
revelation
would
be
an
understatement
but
thats
what
im
calling
it
anyway
i
order
it
assuming
i
would
like
it
and
i
end
up
loving
the
sweet
earthy
bastard
this
is
an
ipa
that
grabs
you
by
the
ears
and
shakes
you
then
gives
you
a
big
wet
kiss
for
the
effort
abv
be
damned
it
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
you
want
more
and
more
such
a
blending
of
complexity
is
a
tribute
to
scott
i
for
one
would
like
to
thank
him
for
this
elixir
and
i
know
im
not
the
only
one
thanks
to
jcwattsrugger
for
bringing
back
a
growler
of
this
for
me
from
pa
the
beer
smells
of
bread
and
pineyresineyperfumey
hops
this
beer
is
made
with
amarillo
and
simcoe
hops
and
15
rye
it
tastes
incredible
this
is
the
best
local
made
ipa
ever
to
me
its
better
than
weyerbacher
double
simcoe
and
dogfish
head
60
minute
ipa
why
its
the
rye
it
gives
it
a
luscious
dry
spicy
character
that
i
simply
adore

an
ipa

brew
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
of
choice
on
29th
in
eugene
i
like
rye
beers
quite
a
bit
this
one
is
pretty
ok
but
totally
sessionable
in
stark
contrast
to
the
usual
hop
wallop
of
ales
from
america
typically
featuring
rye
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
not
bad
tasting
but
not
terribly
intriguing
either
o
a
really
nicely
balanced
and
sessionable
summer
beer
different
from
you
average
pale
ale
or
even
rye
pale
ale
the
flavor
profile
is
wellbalanced
and
pretty
unique
really
digging
this
one
i
like
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
would
quench
my
thirst
on
a
hot
day
its
a
good
alternative
to
the
usual
spring
seasonals
appearance
is
honey
in
color
supporting
a
fair
but
thin
head
leaving
spotty
lace
smell
of
citris
honey
and
floral
hops
taste
has
a
honey
breadiness
caramel
malt
with
the
rye
and
a
bitterness
that
makes
itself
known
but
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
being
a
borderline
summer
session
for
me
this
is
not
overall
that
bad
but
its
not
doing
too
much
for
me
either
its
drinkable
and
i
could
have
it
again
but
its
not
that
impressive
either
had
a
pint
at
clyde
common
the
rye
flavors
isnt
expansive
and
deep
but
it
is
distinct
this
is
a
dry
spicy
rye
ale
a
legit
rye
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
rye
lovers
its
average
weight
and
reasonably
drinkable
a
standard
american
craft
ale
the
flavor
has
a
mix
of
malty
toasted
bready
rye
with
a
dry
grapefruit
hops
kick
that
blends
right
into
the
rye
malts
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
shy
amount
of
offwhite
head
didnt
stick
around
either
aroma
is
light
as
well
pale
malt
touch
of
rye
and
some
hops
spicy
and
floral
with
a
bit
of
citrus
comes
out
of
its
shell
a
bit
on
taste
follows
the
nose
with
light
malt
bit
of
rye
and
spicy
floral
citrus
hop
beer
is
smooth
with
good
balance
on
the
bittering
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
stand
outtish
in
any
way
drinkable
enough
in
its
way
but
a
bit
depressing
as
well
it
could
have
used
the
springboard
of
the
rye
better
to
express
some
spicy
hop
characters
as
it
is
its
a
bit
bland
and
dull
o
nothing
out
of
balance
in
any
way
its
smooth
and
interesting
in
a
low
key
way
its
billed
as
a
summer
seasonal
which
is
exactly
what
it
is
its
got
rye
and
honey
which
is
probably
what
makes
it
interesting
but
its
hard
to
say
exactly
why
overall
fairly
enjoyable
a
light
beer
but
a
nice
beer
this
beer
is
nicely
textured
with
good
bitterness
but
well
integrated
with
the
acids
and
body
finishes
long
and
smooth
a
very
good
beer
but
lacks
the
overall
punch
i
expect
and
receive
in
most
rye
ales
overall
i
think
this
is
a
subpar
beer
based
on
the
label
description
i
had
hoped
for
more
probably
wont
try
this
again
unless
i
got
a
bad
under
carbonated
bottle
might
try
on
tap
if
i
see
it
im
not
detecting
a
whole
lot
of
rye
coming
throuh
in
the
nose
pleasant
aromas
of
bready
malt
with
citric
and
herbal
notes
a
touch
of
honeyish
sweetness
rye
flavor
is
much
more
potent
appearing
as
if
out
of
nowhere
to
deliver
its
signature
savoryspicy
duo
it
works
pretty
nicely
with
the
moderately
sweet
malt
profile
the
hops
cooperate
as
well
somewhat
citric
somewhat
grassy
somewhat
herbal
fairly
grainy
and
crisp
in
the
finish
not
exactly
a
storm
of
rye
but
solid
o
pretty
good
unfortunately
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
with
offering
i
dont
know
that
i
would
even
guess
there
was
rye
used
in
this
overall
a
flavorful
refreshing
summer
beer
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
a
great
well
rounded
brew
for
a
style
i
dont
usually
go
straight
for
this
is
one
of
the
better
commercial
examples
that
puts
it
self
forward
as
a
straight
up
rye
beer
super
aggressive
pour
only
yields
a
one
finger
head
in
my
standard
pint
glass
the
head
in
completely
white
and
has
mostly
big
bubbles
some
small
ones
but
for
the
most
part
the
head
is
pretty
lame
good
lacing
throughout
the
glass
is
nice
and
the
head
never
completely
disappears
but
its
still
not
too
great
the
body
is
a
very
cloudy
dark
orange
color
the
color
isnt
nearly
dark
enough
for
it
to
be
this
non
transparent
so
there
must
be
a
cloudy
factor
in
here
as
well
carbonation
looks
extremely
low
very
few
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
overall
the
looks
is
good
the
fact
that
the
head
leaves
a
nice
layer
of
foam
on
top
of
the
body
really
saves
it
and
the
lacing
helps
a
lot
too
the
body
is
solid
so
no
problems
there
overall
a
good
look
but
the
head
for
sure
could
use
some
improving
the
smell
is
interesting
because
you
can
for
sure
pick
up
on
the
honey
smell
that
aspect
is
there
the
pale
ale
smell
is
a
little
hard
to
clarify
though
i
cant
tell
if
its
going
to
be
all
malt
or
a
mixture
of
nice
malt
and
nice
hops
obviously
its
not
going
to
be
all
hops
because
its
a
pale
ale
and
hopefully
its
not
all
malt
but
the
smell
kinda
indicates
that
it
might
all
over
the
beer
doesnt
smell
bad
it
smells
good
but
im
going
to
give
it
a
3
5
because
im
pretty
sure
its
going
to
be
a
very
heavy
malted
pale
ale
the
taste
is
very
very
interesting
because
the
honey
and
malt
are
very
small
frankly
all
the
flavors
are
small
its
really
just
a
mix
of
malt
hops
honey
and
water
not
one
flavor
is
much
more
prominent
than
any
others
im
shocked
at
how
small
all
the
flavors
all
though
its
really
just
very
watered
down
i
mean
it
almost
works
for
the
style
just
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
light
summer
ale
but
its
just
too
light
its
supposed
to
be
a
pale
ale
and
it
doesnt
meet
that
criteria
it
does
have
all
the
necessary
flavors
they
are
all
there
which
is
good
and
the
hops
are
there
and
i
was
afraid
there
would
be
zero
hops
its
just
too
watery
all
around
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
will
say
that
it
is
barely
getting
a
3
5
on
taste
the
mouthfeel
isnt
terribly
thin
its
for
sure
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
its
not
as
watery
as
the
taste
is
its
a
decent
mouthfeel
for
a
pale
ale
the
carbonation
is
pretty
damn
low
but
its
not
really
offensive
it
works
for
a
summer
beer
i
suppose
drinkability
may
be
its
best
factor
not
an
offensive
beer
and
its
very
light
and
somewhat
tasty
overall
though
this
is
just
another
disappointing
beer
from
oakshire
i
remember
all
of
there
beers
to
be
much
better
than
they
have
been
when
i
have
reviewed
them
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
and
frankly
one
of
the
better
brews
from
oakshire
it
has
all
the
necessary
weapons
its
just
firing
a
little
short
on
all
of
them
we
will
see
if
the
flavors
pump
out
more
potency
when
the
beer
warms
but
for
now
just
coming
short
on
all
the
flavors

overall
still
not
a
rye
fan
d
good
not
great
d
the
carbonation
could
be
a
little
bit
less
the
use
of
honey
was
done
very
well
it
is
the
perfect
amount
to
balance
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
rye
does
not
seem
to
be
coming
through
though
which
is
why
i
wanted
to
try
this
in
the
first
place
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
distinctive
rye
beer
this
probably
is
not
the
one
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer

still

rye
beer
and
a

thanks
again
scott
pours
with
a
pure
white
head
aroma
is
spot
on
for
a
pils
and
taste
is
incredibly
reminiscent
of
a
northern
german
pils
with
maybe
50
more
ibus
the
rye
is
quite
subtle
and
i
think
adds
nice
to
the
hop
profile
living
in
the
pnw
its
rare
to
see
fresh
pilseners
and
even
though
this
is
a
rye
pale
it
really
almost
reminds
me
of
a
pilsener
until
the
yeast
profile
appears
as
the
beer
warms
up
this
is
quite
a
nice
light
summer
beer
d
oh
so
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
july
afternoon
perfect
for
sipping
in
the
shade
or
i
suppose
pairing
with
anything
from
a
crisp
salad
to
something
spicy
or
grilled
pale
ales
dont
usually
excite
my
much
but
the
deft
balance
of
hops
rye
and
honey
in
this
one
make
it
memorable
and
earn
it
a
spot
in
the
need
to
have
more
this
summer
category
other
comments
the
rye
definitely
comes
through
which
is
nice
because
it
is
so
often
shunted
behind
overly
heavy
hops
or
just
not
present
enough
to
cut
through
the
malt
overall
at
45
a
bomber
it
is
nice
to
try
and
a
great
offering
from
oakshire
and
a
great
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
however
a
little
more
rye
would
make
the
beer
a
real
winner
and
a
repeat
choice
oakshire
describes
line
dry
as
a
rye
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
oregon
blackberry
honey
brewed
with
10
rye
malt
and
10
flaked
rye
it
is
warm
yellow
with
a
plump
body
and
an
exuberant
white
head
the
honey
lends
an
unexpected
yet
intentional
sweetness
while
rye
elements
point
to
a
crisp
dry
terminus
personally
i
prefer
a
grainier
rye
beer
as
a
summertime
thirst
quencher
and
palate
cleanser
but
conceptually
i
get
it
and
the
honey
is
ultimately
a
nice
flourish
if
that
sort
of
thing
appeals
to
you
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
never
fully
dissolves
and
leaves
a
nice
layer
atop
the
glass
and
has
nice
streaming
carbonation
lines
the
aroma
is
sweet
hops
rye
and
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
more
sweet
caramel
malt
upfront
followed
by
and
earthy
bitterness
and
ends
with
a
sweet
spicy
finish
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
this
is
a
very
subtle
beer
and
makes
for
easy
drinking
highly
recommended
for
a
hot
summer
day
spent
on
a
patio
or
outdoors
line
dry
rye
is
the
third
oakshire
ive
tried
and
like
their
watershed
ipa
and
truly
amazing
perfect
storm
imperial
ipa
it
too
is
excellent
my
first
taste
of
ldr
was
at
a
hillstomp
concert
on
a
warm
sunday
afternoon
at
papas
soul
food
kitchen
and
blues
joint
in
eugene
or
the
only
thing
bland
about
this
summer
seasonal
which
was
served
in
a
plastic
compostable
cup
was
the
iced
tea
color
ldr
is
made
with
10
percent
rye
malt
and
10
percent
flaked
malt
which
gives
it
a
refreshing
dry
flavor
that
is
balanced
by
the
moderate
hoppiness
and
malt
finish
my
tongue
must
be
scorched
from
too
many
hoppy
beers
because
i
could
not
taste
the
touch
of
blackberry
honey
used
to
make
the
brew
it
could
have
been
the
music
or
it
could
have
been
papas
fried
catfish
but
oakshires
line
dry
rye
is
one
tasty
hot
weather
antidote
o
to
just
call
this
summer
rye
is
a
bit
misleading
its
really
more
of
a
wellhopped
belgian
table
beer
id
push
that
angle
more
than
the
rye
angle
a
lot
of
people
feel
that
rye
is
coarse
and
a
bit
less
approachable
than
other
grains
so
to
put
that
in
peoples
minds
first
is
a
mistake
in
my
opinion
they
should
also
play
up
the
fact
that
it
is
a
beer
of
true
session
abv
get
that
right
on
the
label
somewhere
its
a
big
selling
point
these
days
at
any
rate
this
is
a
pleasant
and
crushable
little
beer
that
would
be
equally
at
home
pairing
in
the
early
stages
of
a
fancy
multicourse
meal
as
it
would
in
your
hand
after
a
hot
day
of
lawn
mowing
perfect
pairing
partner
for
almost
any
light
salad
ceviche
or
other
such
things
an
insanely
pale
beer
almost
white
in
color
looking
more
like
a
berliner
than
anything
else
hazy
and
yellow
like
its
all
wheat
but
there
is
some
substantial
rye
under
the
lace
airy
white
head
nose
shows
some
mild
spice
and
plenty
of
malt
heft
for
its
color
and
the
flavor
agrees
spicy
from
the
rye
cracked
white
pepper
earthiness
and
a
dried
fruit
aspect
as
well
some
wheat
in
here
too
though
there
has
to
be
carbonation
and
body
are
both
up
for
how
light
it
is
and
the
rye
is
the
dominant
flavor
although
not
out
of
balance
i
may
prefer
a
moderately
larger
hop
plan
for
this
thing
give
it
a
finish
but
i
must
admit
this
is
extremely
unique
as
a
session
beer
with
the
hops
so
mellow
its
refreshing
but
a
little
filling
i
found
but
still
appropriate
in
hot
weather
i
like
how
pale
it
is
lets
the
rye
show
though
really
brilliantly
my
first
mayflower
beer
has
me
keen
for
more
from
them
and
thats
always
a
good
sign
on
tap
at
the
farmhouse
burlington
overall
overall
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
as
an
all
around
summer
session
ale
that
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
slightly
sour
mouthfeel
makes
a
beer
that
is
worth
bringing
to
your
next
cook
out
or
gathering
to
share
with
all
or
just
for
yourself
and
significant
other
at
the
beach
if
you
are
looking
for
an
alternative
to
your
usual
summer
wheat
beer
you
should
check
this
one
out
if
you
get
the
opportunity
to
get
your
hands
on
some
overall
an
refreshing
summer
ale
the
carbonation
and
hoppy
finish
bolster
the
overall
taste
its
a
low
abv
beer
but
it
has
a
lot
of
character
overall
this
is
great
stuff
in
my
opinion
definitely
stands
out
from
the
deluge
of
goldens
and
wheat
ales
that
hit
the
market
for
summer
refreshing
and
delicious
the
taste
brings
out
the
rye
grains
at
first
with
a
notable
lemon
and
floral
hop
character
on
the
backside
slightly
tart
ending
not
high
on
my
list
of
mayflower
brews
but
it
would
be
good
in
the
summer
o
i
bought
a
6pack
as
an
impulse
buy
and
im
glad
i
did
ive
now
had
three
of
these
beers
with
the
third
coming
straight
from
the
bottle
this
third
was
my
favorite
thus
far
as
i
honestly
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
color
of
the
beer
and
somehow
the
hop
character
shines
through
better
directly
from
the
bottle
its
relatively
expensive
so
i
wouldnt
buy
it
for
myself
but
i
might
bring
it
to
the
next
bbq
i
attend
it
really
is
a
nice
summer
beer
tried
it
as
a
cask
conditioned
offering
definitely
improved
the
flavor
the
scores
reflect
a
blending
of
the
two
tastes
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
also
nothing
i
could
get
excited
about
d
a
good
beer
overall
i
didnt
realize
it
was
only
3
8
abv
when
i
bought
it
but
i
would
buy
this
again
perhaps
its
a
little
overpriced
but
mayflower
is
still
a
young
brewery
with
relatively
small
levels
of
scale
economies
so
that
is
understandable
this
is
an
example
of
an
ideal
beer
id
love
to
drink
pitchers
of
after
reaching
the
top
of
a
mountain
on
a
hike
in
new
england
or
in
a
large
field
on
a
picnic
its
that
type
of
beer
i
am
quite
enjoying
it
actually
picked
it
up
on
a
trip
to
visit
my
parents
near
buzzards
bay
pours
more
like
a
pilsnera
pale
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
bit
of
a
surprise
condiering
it
is
a
rye
beer
i
smell
just
the
slightest
hint
of
rye
light
malt
base
with
the
rye
more
of
a
feel
on
the
palate
than
overly
powerful
flavors
nice
balance
between
the
rye
the
other
malts
and
some
spriggy
hops
nice
session
beer
for
a
hot
and
muggy
july
day
overall
this
had
promise
to
be
a
good
beverage
as
the
rye
flavors
are
out
in
front
and
potent
but
there
simply
werent
enough
other
flavors
in
here
even
considering
that
its
a
summer
ale
the
watery
taste
and
mouthfeel
seem
to
evidence
that
the
brew
could
have
used
a
few
more
handfuls
of
malt
and
hops
the
former
being
especially
important
in
providing
a
better
sugary
backbone
mouthfeel
is
great
great
summer
beer
cause
its
so
refreshing
incredibly
light
and
well
carbonated
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
if
you
like
low
alcohol
beers
this
one
is
very
flavorful
cheers
for
keeping
this
almost
alcoholfree
its
a
good
beer
its
not
going
to
replace
bitter
brewer
as
my
hot
afternnoon
beer
of
choice
but
its
certainly
worthy
a
very
well
made
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
summer
ale
when
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
bright
golden
body
with
one
inch
of
white
fizzy
head
that
dissappears
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
citrus
with
some
rye
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
crisp
overall
this
is
one
i
would
drink
in
the
summer
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
straw
color
with
a
decent
1
finger
white
head
that
lasts
the
smell
is
slightly
citrus
hops
with
a
definite
rye
presence
the
flavor
is
very
light
on
the
rye
with
a
great
citrus
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
light
well
carbed
and
mouth
watering
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
out
there
if
you
live
in
the
distribution
area
drink
it
if
you
dont
trade
for
it
then
drink
it
light
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
flavor
would
be
bland
if
not
for
the
rye
it
brings
in
some
spice
that
livens
things
up
a
bit
an
easy
drinking
beer
good
for
picnic
pours
a
nice
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is

the
taste
is

slightly
sweet
nice
little
touch
of
citrus
medium
body
with
a
nice
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
another
tasty
brew
from
mayflower
overall
i
find
that
some
beers
that
lack
complexity
can
be
commended
because
they
are
easy
to
knock
back
without
having
to
appreciate
it
fully
however
i
think
this
beer
needs
more
complexity
it
seems
muted
aroma
is
somewhat
dulled
flavors
arent
very
potent
and
the
feel
and
carbonation
could
be
kicked
up
it
is
however
very
refreshing
o
good
summer
beer
a
bit
of
flavor
but
not
overpowering
resembles
lemonade
as
much
in
appearance
as
drinkability
o
it
has
some
potential
but
this
attempt
at
a
rye
and
wheat
summer
thirstquencher
has
muddled
flavors
and
severely
lacks
carbonation
o
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
swear
this
is
a
witbier
with
some
rye
in
it
regardless
of
what
it
is
its
very
light
and
refreshing
with
just
an
extra
kick
from
the
rye
honestly
i
think
it
would
garner
better
ratings
in
the
witbier
category
a
good
summer
beer
as
the
name
would
imply
pretty
refreshing
i
am
a
huge
rye
fan
but
im
not
exactly
sure
how
well
it
works
here
this
is
a
fun
beer
but
one
that
takes
its
fun
very
seriously
it
was
really
well
crafted
to
be
exactly
what
i
think
the
brewers
wanted
it
to
be
i
like
it
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
very
mild
kick
good
lighter
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
flavorful
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
i
could
pound
through
this
all
night
long
drinkable
thats
for
sure
between
this
and
spring
hop
mayflower
has
made
two
very
solid
hot

beers
not
overly
complicated
but
still

and
bounds
over

bmc

a
strange
hazy
yellow
that
is
very

almost
reminds
me
of

there
is

drinkers
should

i
could

an

sitting

pool
ddont
absolutely
love
the
taste
so
the
drinkability
get
pegged
down
a
bit
however
at
such
a
low
abv
this
can
be
imbibed
quite
quickly
and
easily
d
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
there
are
equally

overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
despite
its
relatively
old
age
bottled
in
early
may
if
i
remember
correctly
a
nice
complex
and
most
importantly
easytodrink
beer
thats
well
worth
a
shot
after
my
first
sip
of
this
beer
i
actually
had
to
ask
the
bartender
if
i
got
the
right
beer
because
i
wasnt
sure
what
the
hell
i
was
drinking
im
a
mayflower
fan
but
this
one
just
didnt
work
for
me
although
i
do
appreciate
the
low
abv
for
a
summer
beer
one
of
those
i
like
it
better
than
i
rate
it
beers
more
flavor
and
complexity
than
i
would
anticipate

abv
d
i
love
this
as
a
summer
session
beer
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
and
a
true
session
beers
abv
well
done
on
tap
at
peoples
republik
in
cambridge
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
beautiful
golden
colored
body
thin
white
head
floated
on
top
smell
was
a
lemon
and
pine
aroma
taste
was
very
pleasant
flavorful
with
a
bit
of
citrus
fruit
but
the
rye
gave
it
a
haylike
flavor
also
brewing
with
rye
also
lent
a
crispness
to
the
mouthfeel
that
i
really
enjoyed
mouthfeel
was
bright
but
approachable
i
would
drink
this
beer
every
season
not
just
summer
one
of
the
better
summer
seasonal
releases
that
i
have
tried
this
year
this
was
one
of
my
lowest
review
i
like
mayflower
brewing
company
i
honestly
feel
bad
when
i
dont
like
a
beer
but
reviews
are
based
upon
personal
opinion
and
i
think
this
beer
kinda
sucks
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
carbed
enough
to
be
prickly
and
light
on
the
tongue
i
could
easily
kick
a
few
of
these
back
during
the
summer
and
would
choose
this
beer
over
the
usual
lawnmower
brews
like
american
wheat
d
a
great
session
brew
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
while
hanging
with
my
friends
at
the
bbq
a
great
summer
brew
i
bought
just
a
single
of
this
beer
and
i
wish
it
was
a
whole
six
pack
this
was
a
great
summer
beer
very
light
in
texture
and
alcohol
which
makes
it
quite
sessionable
the
rye
flavor
is
evident
but
it
is
not
overpowering
enough
that
would
make
one
sick
of
it
another
great
beer
from
a
great
new
england
brewer
an
interesting
thing
from
the
brewery
of
one
of
my
favorite
porters
foggy
and
hazy
in
the
glass
the
color
of
watereddown
pinesol
with
plenty
of
the
lemons
found
in
that
cleaner
but
none
of
the
ammonia
or
whatever
the
solvent
is
that
they
use
oddly
i
detected
a
distinct
aroma
of
vinyl
or
rubber
something
plasticky
the
head
lasted
but
an
instant
some
bitterness
in
the
nose
as
well
the
vinyl
carries
into
the
taste
somewhat
covered
by
lemons
and
cloves
but
still
prominent
a
bit
fruitpunchy
overall
with
a
denser
body
and
nice
fizz
to
cut
into
the
summer
heat
still
this
is
no
great
beer
but
rather
a
hohummer
that
you
can
drink
easily
the
rye
adds
some
spice
and
a
new
tang
that
isnt
present
in
other
lighter
fare
and
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
slammer
after
you
finish
painting
the
bathroom
on
a
stagnant
and
stuffy
july
afternoon
i
ought
to
be
able
to
choke
back
the
remaining
five
bottles
but
i
probably
wont
be
repeating
this
beer
d
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
very
very
refreshing
how
bout
some
inkwell
stout
to
folow
this
d
3
8
abv
and
an
extremely
dry
finish
make
this
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
its
complex
herbal
and
earthy
poured
into
mayflower
nonic
formed

above
the
very
cloudy

head
falls
rather
quickly
with
average

aroma
is
wheat
and
spicy
rye
taste
starts
with
a
glimmer
of
wheat
then
rye
spices
and
closes
with
a
peek
of
citrus
and
some
clean
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drinkability
is
very
easy
as
a
thirstquenching
summer
beer
win
as
a
rye
beer
not
quite
all
i
would
look
for
i
think
ill
think
of
this
as
one
of
the
more
flavorful
summer
brews
and
be
happy
with
it

semihazy
pale
yellow
with
a
bubbly
two
inch
bright
white
head
this
beer
looks
a
lot
like
a
berlinerweisse
head
eventually
settles
into
a
fairly
solid
quarter
inch
cap
with
some
delicate
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
session
nose
reveals
some
citrus
earthyherbal
aromatics
and
a
nice
mix
of
rye
and
wheat
taste
falls
somewhat
short
of
the
expectations
that
the
appearance
and
smell
suggest
many
of
the
qualities
in
the
nose
come
out
in
the
flavor
profile
but
everything
is
a
little
bland
and
watery
with
the
lightly
lingering
herbalearthy
quality
that
was
expressed
in
the
nose
manifesting
itself
before
culminating
in
a
light
lingering
bitterness
not
really
hops
bittering
per
se
so
it
must
be
coming
from
the
rye
mouthfeel
is
light
in
consistency
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
crisp
finish
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
qualities
to
it
and
proves
that
a
low
abv
beer
can
be
pleasant
and
refreshing
unfortunately
the
flavor
falls
a
little
short
for
me
still
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
a
nice
alternative
to
a
hefe
because
it
has
some
different
qualities
i
do
love
a
simple
brew
that
has
some
life
drinkability
i
had
one
bottle
out
of
a
pint
glass
and
passed
on
the
rest
the
remaining
bottles
will
be
sent
home
with
someone
who
might
like
it
more
it
drinks
ok
nothing
is
oppressive
but
i
have
had
more
refreshing
summer
seasonals
as
well
as
more
flavorful
and
more
aromatic
too
rye
is
way
too
far
in
the
background
in
this
one
and
it
falls
into
just
another
wheat
beer
category
good
for
mayflower
for
branching
out
and
experimenting
with
different
flavours
and
ingredients
but
i
unfortunately
dont
feel
that
this
beer
is
all
that
well
balanced
f
pretty
bitter
actually
not
crazy
over
the
top
but
a
nice
bitterness
comes
through
with
teh
grassy
slight
spicy
and
pale
hops
that
again
have
a
fresh
cascade
dry
hop
taste
they
are
accentuated
with
the
dryness
it
gets
dry
and
i
mean
really
dry
imagine
that
it
just
keeps
getting
drier
and
drier
until
is
really
really
dry
imagine
that
being
way
way
too
dry
dont
remember
the
exact
south
park
quote
but
you
get
the
idea
its
very
dry
lots
of
wheat
lingering
with
some
hints
of
spicy
rye
but
barely
there
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
pretty
refreshing
being
less
than
4
it
drinks
really
well
too
i
could
pound
many
of
these
without
skipping
a
beat
cloudy
yellow
a
bit
murky
with
a
fine
skim
of
white
bubbles
and
a
thin
collar
a
bit
of
lacing
fair
head
retention
sour
wheat
aroma
dominated
initially
but
spicy
rye
took
over
as
it
warmed
a
bit
of
lemon
character
and
citrusy
hops
too
bracing
bitterness
spicy
and
peppery
light
malt
lemony
bitter
finish
light
to
the
point
of
being
thin
dry
a
bit
of
a
soapy
texture
light
and
refreshing
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
harsh
this
one
was
okay
but
it
didnt
really
come
together
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dirty
dishwater
yellow
with
no
head
and
no
lace
the
nose
has
witbier
or
hefeweizen
all
over
it
you
have
the
cloves
coriander
lemony
orange
peel
and
some
subtle
spices
the
nose
is
very
good
the
taste
is
a
real
let
down
and
it
is
from
the
rye
the
grain
is
just
too
coarse
to
be
in
a
summer
ale
enough
said
the
beer
is
very
light
bodied
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
it
is
flawed
overall
not
great
maybe
with
some
spicy
food
but
i
could
never
have
two
of
these
in
succession
the
bitter
edge
in
this
one
just
sucks
the
life
out
of
the
beer
i
actually
think
my
ratings
flavorwise
might
be
too
generous
if
you
want
to
drink
local
and
support
the
little
guy
try
this
if
not
i
certainly
would
not
trade
for
this
overall
though
its
a
really
easy
drinking
brew
3
8
its
something
reminded
me
a
lot
of
maybe
real
ales
full
moon
pale
rye
from
texas
just
a
little
thinner
though
maybe
trying
to
be
too
brash
in
carbonation
not
as
much
flavor
going
on
but
almost
as
easy
to
drink
this
is
now
available
in
6pks
and
i
cannot
get
enough
drinkability
this
is
a
super
smooth
beer
and
is
very
sessionable
i
like
the
hoppy
feel
to
this
without
the
high
abv
this
is
one
of
mayflowers
best
to
date
not
a
bad
choice
on
a
hot
day
very
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
day
especially
since
the
abv
is
very
low
which
is
a
big
plus
for
me
very
refreshing
and
light
absolutely
check
this
one
out
if
you
can
another
winner
from
matt
and
the
mayflower
gang
i
dont
know
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
or
something
but
this
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
malt
bomb
it
also
feels
flat
and
nothing
like
a
rye
ipa
top
of
the
line
ipa
this
one
and
black
markets
liberation
ipa
are
fantastic
this
one
exceeded
my
expectations
give
this
one
a
try
and
if
your
in
the
area
of
temecula
check
out
this
brewery

about
the
beer
either
notes
a

a

solid
rye
kick
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
syrupy
side
and
the
finish
is
not
the
most
crisp
still
this
beer
is
a
great

of
why
rye

is
a
killer

a

supported
by
a
substantial

body
and
a
good
touch
of
rye
all
well
balanced
enjoyable
pretty
looking
beer
leaves
nice
lacing
though
the
excessive
foaming
upon
the
pour
was
a
concern
aroma
gave
no
indication
of
anything
off
but
really
this
beer
is
sloppy
earthy
and
an
alpha
acids
swamp
i
was
always
on
the
fence
about
black
market
this
beer
is
strike
two
glancing
at
the
reviews
i
have
to
believe
i
got
a
bum
bottle
since
this
seems
like
a
beer
thats
right
in
my
wheelhouse
but
roaring
carbonation
is
never
a
good
sign
this
bottle
however
is
dismal
satisfying
ipa
in
general
its
in
a
very
competitive
market
being
just
north
of
san
diego
so
it
may
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
bb
very
nice
rye
ipa
that
everyone
should
try
out
flavors
carmel
malt
citrus
and
light
pine
hops
finish
with
a
hint
of
spice
bottle
was
almost
the
same
except
a
little
more
hops
to
my
taste
great
beer
not
over
the
top
and
is
more
of
what
i
think
what
an
ipa
should
be
d
very
drinkable
great
rye
flavor
with
good
overall
balance
and
a
nice
hop
profile
ps
some
of
my
other
favorite
go
to
ipas
include
pliney
the
elder
racer
5
and
green
flash
this
ipa
fits
perfectly
imo
with
the
above
mentioned
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
and
if
i
lived
in
the
area
this
would
be
my
goto
local
ipa
for
sure
the
dipa
was
good
as
well
d
a
nice
easy
summer
drink
with
the
delicate
orange
and
floral
character
served
up
over
a
nice
light
body
probably
not
going
to
seek
out
again
anytime
soon
but
i
did
enjoy
and
would
have
again
as
a
former
temecula
native
i
would
rally
for
these
guys
to
come
up
with
something
a
bit
more
impressive
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
rye
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
rye
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
d
not
bad
probably
wont
try
again
c
quite
a
pleasant
big
hoppy
beer
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
southern
end
of
socal
for
interesting
and
wellmade
beers
also
worth
trying
on
tap
if
youre
in
temecula
seems
to
be
one
of
the
regulars
very
hoppy
almost
a
tad
to
much
overall
this
is
a
great
ipa
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
ipas
although
that
has
been
changing
a
bit
lately
ill
revisit
this
at
some
point
as
my
tastes
continue
to
change
by
as
it
stands
now
this
is
a
very
solid
ipa
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
when
the
mood
strikes
drink
another
good
local
beer
this
is
my
wheelhouse
a
balanced
ipa
with
nice
hops
and
some
good
citrus
would
like
a
growler
of
this
for
a
saturday
night
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
cant
wait
till
they
bottle
it
o
another
good
beer
in
the
growing
trend
of
hoppy
rye
beers
o
well
balanced
not
an
extreme
ipa
or
rye
beer
kind
of
in
the
middle
which
i
think
is
what
they
were
going
for
im
kind
of
surprised
by
some
of
the
reviews
so
far
of
this
beer
given
how
it
was
judged
at
gabf
granted
it
was
not
a
killerwhale
rye
beer
or
ipa
but
it
was
good
maybe
something
happened
at
the
bars
they
were
served
at
dirty
lines
something
in
transit
bad
batch
not
sure
overall
i
hate
to
trash
a
beer
from
a
small
brewery
with
few
reviews
but
this
is
one
to
avoid
i
put
this
on
tap
hoffers
and
it
lasted
just
a
few
days
the
viscosity
of
this
citrus
heavy
brew
was
like
molasses
i
couldnt
believe
how
thick
and
syrupy
this
came
out
of
the
faucet
very
difficult
to
create
any
kind
of
head
on
this
beer
but
weirdly
enough
tons
of
lacing
were
left
on
the
glass
amazing
citrus
and
hop
overwhelms
the
nose
on
the
initial
gulp
mouth
feel
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
the
roof
of
your
mouth
although
really
thick
and
hop
heavy
this
rye
ipa
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
had
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
dont
think
this
beer
will
be
for
those
expecting
a
large
amount
of
actual
rye
flavor
the
flavor
of
the
hops
almost
completely
over
powers
it
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
damn
good
ipa
with
just
a
touch
of
rye
then
i
would
highly
suggest
this
one
taste
lacked
hops
its
an
ipa
man
couldnt
really
detect
a
rye
bill
to
this
based
on
the
taste
i
thought
it
must
be
low
tasted
more
like
a
brown
ale
with
higher
alcohol
to
call
this
a
rye
ipa
just
seemed
like
it
was
missing
the
most
basic
premise
of
what
a
rye
ipa
tastes
like
hops
and
that
rye
spice
neither
were
here
final
score
4
04
deep
copper
color
faint
aroma
of
citrus
dough
and
rye
taste
is
similar
with
a
strong
malt
presence
but
with
mild
hop
flavors
and
medium
dry
finish
its
not
the
cloying
malt
that
i
dislike
in
many
ales
nice
spicy
quality
as
well
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
it
had
good
flavor
could
benefit
from
more
hops
enjoyed
this
but
cant
really
get
down
on
a
guy
for
being
heavy
handed
with
the
hops
but
i
think
mr
lawson
did
provide
freely
he
may
have
had
lts
for
this
batch
haha
very
good
not
great
overall
a
nice
wellhopped
pale
with
a
lot
of
rye
spice
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
a
spicy
rye
for
sure
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
of
the
style
oonce
again
not
a
big
drinker
of
ryes
but
finally
cracked
this
after
going
to
the
lawsons
6th
party
enjoyed
it
like
everything
lawsons
does
but
i
dont
think
im
biased
they
just
make
good
beer
o
second
beer
ive
had
from
lawsons
and
this
doesnt
compare
to
double
sunshine
but
it
is
unfair
to
set
the
bar
that
high
this
is
a
very
very
well
made
rye
pale
ale
in
perfect
balance
and
very
drinkable

slight
rye
spice
to
balance
it
out
very
drinkable
and
delicious
pours
clear
orange
with
a
fat
creamy
head
of
tan
foam
that
lasted
and
left
nice
lace
sweet
light
malt
smell
spicy
sweet
rye
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
sweet
malt
a
bold
hop
floral
and
a
peppery
and
spicy
rye
a
fruit
skin
sweetness
and
a
very
faint
musk
it
smells
like
a
rye
beer
light
sweet
rye
grain
cracker
with
sweet
flowers
taste
is
pale
malt
with
a
lovely
hop
floral
and
bitter
my
question
was
is
there
wheat
in
this
theres
a
hint
of
something
smooth
in
the
malt
the
hops
abound
and
are
ipa
style
bitter
a
touch
of
graham
cracker
is
especially
pleasant
to
the
both
the
nose
and
the
drink
the
bitter
is
sharp
in
the
finish
and
and
there
was
some
earth
in
the
malt
too
a
deep
amber
with
yellow
white
head
spotty
lacing
great
rye
smell
some
good
sweet
malt
a
bit
thin
very
rye
water
like
malt
bomb
overall
expected
a
bit
more
but
not
bad
just
not
great
hoppy
oaky
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
color
was
a
nice
darker
medium
amber
slight
reddish
hue
a
nice
2
finger
creamy
slightly
off
white
head
formed
didnt
last
long
but
stuck
a
bit
to
the
sides
after
the
initial
pour
next
to
no
carbonation
rose
from
the
depths
aroma
was
nicely
hoppy
with
a
small
hint
of
sugary
sweetness
flavor
was
spicy
hoppy
not
overly
so
and
was
well
balanced
felt
good
in
the
mouth
slightly
over
tingly
but
coated
nicely
overall
a
respectable
beer
well
balanced
and
pleasant
body
is
soft
almost
creamylike
texture
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
to
carry
the
beer
overall
this
beer
hits
pretty
damn
close
to
the
american
pale
ale
category
even
though
rye
is
used
to
excess
here
tasty
beer
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
dirty
amber
in
color
with
moderate
cloudiness
and
just
a
very
light
off
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
just
spicy
malt
and
little
else
there
isnt
any
hop
presence
at
all
its
just
sweet
malt
and
rye
spice
the
flavors
are
ok
but
there
isnt
much
hop
presence
the
malt
bill
is
nice
however
featuring
light
caramel
and
light
toffee
with
that
trademark
rye
spice
i
just
wish
hops
were
present
it
drinks
with
slight
residual
sugar
and
on
the
upper
end
of
light
in
body
it
unfortunately
llacked
proper
carbonation
this
beer
was
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
me
it
is
nowhere
near
ryed
da
lightning
or
other
hoppy
rye
pales
overall
a
malt
forward
pale
ale
done
right
assertive
hop
presence
with
complimentary
malt
character
higher
carbonation
would
have
improved
this
quite
a
bit
o
this
is
a
very
balanced
relatively
mild
rye
beer
very
drinkable
and
tasty
but
not
the
best
rye
pale
ive
had
o
if
you
like
rye
pales
then
this
is
a
great
example
of
one
i
really
enjoy
how
light
it
was
while
packing
a
nice
dose
of
rye
and
hops
if
you
dont
like
rye
beers
id
have
to
say
avoid
this
is
my
first
bottled
lawsons
and
im
impressed
its
not
a
knockout
but
its
a
very
wellcomposed
and
drinkable
pale
ale
that
displays
a
lot
of
polish
overall
nice
great
nose
bit
syrupy
and
malty
but
the
hops
are
awesome
and
add
nicely
to
the
rye
o
overall
this
is
a
rather
nice
beer
from
lawsons
good
slight
spicy
rye
finish
with
solid
delicious
multiple
hops
surprisingly
good
clear
pour
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite

moderate
retention
and
nice
soapy
lacing
aroma
of
herbal
hops
pine
a
bit
of
earth
wood
taste
of
toasted
grains
bready
with
a
nice
herbal
hoppiness
a
touch
of
orange
peel
slightly
nutty
and

nice
and
wellbalanced
overall
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
medium

smooth
and
drinkable
first
of
a
few
of
lawsons
beers
i
have
gotten
my
hands
on
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
clear
rich
copperbronze
with
a
large
two

that
left

it

into

are

but
not
overpoweringa
decent
shot
of
lacticsharp

in
the
finish
a
nice

driven
rye
ale
like
i
like
thema
good
introduction
to
lawsons
for
me
i
enjoy
ryes
and
this
is
really
nice
example
not
all
beers
are
supposed
to
be
epic
this
is
just
a
really
nice
brew
if
you
didnt
tell
me
this
was
a
rye
beer
brewed
with
a
nice
blend
of
generous
hops
i
would
be
pleased
with
it
i
do
get
a
little
rye
but
not
as
much
as
say
reds
rye
i
wanted
the
hop
profile
to
be
brighter
so
good
not
great
o
a
very
refreshing
and
delightful
pale
not
as
hard
to
get
as
other
lawsons
beers
so
i
suggest
people
seek
this
out
well
worth
it
d
this
sucker
is
brimming
with
hops
and
bordering
ipa
territory
i
wish
i
would
have
cracked
this
open
in
june
or
july
because
this
has
a
really
complex
hop
character
for
a
pale
ale
the
addition
of
the
rye
really
spiced
things
up
too
cheers
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
incorporated
here
rye
beer
pale
ale
ohh
i
dont
think
so
this
brute
is
hopped
to
the
perceived
ibus
of
something
more
in
line
with
a
dipa
overall
quite
good
stuff
but
a
bit
of
a
surprise
with
how
hopped
it
was
worth
a
try
for
sure
thanks
again
heath
this
is
another
well
done
beer
from
the
lfl
with
a
great
balance
of
aggressive
flavors
from
the
rye
and
hops
here
yet
this
was
still
very
smooth
and
approachable
as
a
whole
to
point
where
i
would
almost
call
this
borderline
refreshing
on
the
palate
sign
me
up
for
a
bottle
of
this
anytime
overall
fairly
drinkable
and
interesting
o
great
rye
beer
in
my
opinion
the
hops
manage
to
balance
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
and
the
dry
finish
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
my
travels
through
vermont
are
only
reenforcing
what
i
already
thought
about
the
beer
scene
here
great
creative
brewers
putting
out
some
high
quality
stuff
o
i
liked
this
one
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
overly
chewy
beers
and
i
was
afraid
this
one
might
go
along
those
lines
but
i
am
glad
it
didnt
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
lawsons
offerings
the
beer
is
transparent
orange
with
an
average
sized
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
behind
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
malt
rye
and
hops
with
some
pine
and
citrus
in
the
mix
as
well
the
flavor
is
nice
with
everything
balanced
well
the
rye
component
is
subtle
but
present
throughout
citrus
and
floral
hop
notes
mingle
nicely
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
brew
but
not
anything
that
really
moved
me
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
o
one
of
the
best
examples
of
rye
in
a
beer
there
is
and
another
great
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
another
huge
thanks
michael
the
taste
has
lots
of
bready
malt
that
arent
the
most
appealing
to
me
almost
macro
like
in
their
flavor
dry
rye
and
semi
bitter
pine
hops
save
this
from
being
ordinary
pretty
smooth
body
and
good
carbonation
not
overly
bitter
not
overly
memorable
for
me
but
i
may
want
to
try
it
again
as
many
reviews
i
see
have
much
better
scores
from
people
who
usually
rate
a
lot
lower
than
i
do
disappointing
given
all
the
hype
surrounding
the
elusive
beer
from
this
brewer
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
good
dosing
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
some
light
bready
malt
along
with
some
spicy
rye
following
that
theres
a
pretty
good
amount
of
hops
mostly
citrus
and
pine
orange
and
grapefruit
standout
and
there
are
some
slight
floral
hops
there
as
well
the
flavor
bumps
this
up
and
offers
a
nice
experience
combining
the
rye
and
hops
quite
well
medium
body
and
moderate
to
heavy
bitterness
solid
brew
pours
a
perfectly
clear
bronzed
brown
with
a
massive
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
finger
thick
cap
with
short
broken
clumps
of
lacing
covering
the
entire
glass
aroma
is
like
a
loaf
of
bread
with
a
splash
of
citrus
hops
biscuit
malt
and
rye
spice
are
the
first
notes
detected
before
a
thin
wisp
of
citrus
picks
through
at
the
finish
flavor
is
a
little
more
hop
forward
and
resembles
some
of
the
other
hoppy
lawsons
beers
ive
had
rye
is
present
throughout
but
it
shines
in
the
finish
with
an
exceptionally
dry
spicy
kick
light
creamy
and
smooth
body
with
moderate
carbonation
near
perfect
balance
of
the
sweet
hops
and
spicy
rye
with
a
phenomenal
long
and
rich
finish
easily
one
of
the
better
rye
ipas
ive
had
excellent
beer
another
masterpiece
from
lawsons
in
a
genre
rye
that
i
love
anybody
who
wants
to
send
me
lawsons
anytime
im
game
beer
is
big
in
body
and
nice
in
finish
the
overall
effect
is
great
it
is
not
sweet
up
front
mild
carbonation
unfolds
into
a
nice
hoppy
palate
complex
fruity
bitter
finish
but
not
so
bitter
to
cover
up
some
graininess
at
the
back
the
rye
comes
out
here
more
than
anyplace
else
i
really
like
it
highly
drinkable
beer
fabulous
in
fact
rye
seems
to
be
very
well
balance
shines
through
just
right
not
under
powering
or
overbearing
well
made
beer
serving
type
bottle
a
great
refined
and
balanced
beer
from
shawn
d
really
enjoyable
this
is
now
the
second
lawsons
ive
had
in
as
many
days
i
like
what
sean
is
doing
keep
it
up
d
really
great
and
sessionable
not
a
big
beer
and
not
meant
to
be
a
good
beer
to
grab
and
be
able
to
enjoy
from
start
to
finish
drinkability
an
excellent
rye
beer
where
the
rye
is
pronounced
it
mixes
beautifully
with
the
hops
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
am
thrilled
my
buddy
let
me
split
his
bomber
one
of
the
best
in
this
style
once
again
im
really
impressed
with
lawsons
offerings
this
beer
looks
great
has
a
big
bitter
flavor
and
lots
of
rye
all
handcrafted
by
a
small
vermont
brewery
lawsons
definitely
know
what
theyre
doing
and
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
their
beers
wherever
i
can
find
them

citrusy

thats
about
it
taste
reveals
citrus
wheat
and
big
bittering
hops
coming
out
at
the
finish
closer
to
a
rye
pa
than
any
rye
beer
ive
tried
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
assertive
background
effervescence
that
falls
just
short
of
prickly
and
finishes
dry
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
but
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
very
good
in
a
way
i
need
to
aim
more
for
something
like
this
whenever
i
decide
to
homebrew
again
theres
just
something
special
about
rye
beers
that
hits
the
spot
taste
is
very
bitter
a
nice
combo
from
both
the
hops
and
the
rye
bitterness
a
hint
of
maltiness
brings
it
all
together
an
awesome
rye
beer
keep
um
comin
sean
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
first
time
this
beer
has
been
brewed
best
rye
based
beer
on
the
planet
o
this
is
a
very
uneven
beer
it
has
some
good
characteristics
but
ultimately
falls
short
pours
a
murky
dark
reddish
brown
with
billowing
dense
khaki
colored
head
thick
sheet
of
lace
down
the
glass

the
end

soft
graininess
moderately
spicy
unripe
but
not
tart
plum
medium
plus
bodied
finished
drying
and
mildly
sweet
with
lingering
earthiness
nice
overall
this
beer
really
appeals
to
me
im
very
glad
ive
discovered
it
solid
if
a
bit
strange
for
the
style
a
nice
deviation
but
i
wouldnt
revisit
this
one
a
real
neat
drink
but
unfortunately
seems
like
its
a
little
haphazard
in
its
delivery
overall
a
very
rye
heavy
saison
that
also
happens
to
be
brutally
hopped
and
dark
red
in
color
with
an
inch
or
so
of
lasting
white
head
with
fine
ring
lacing
as
it
drinks
down
the
nose
here
is
spicy
from
the
rye
rich
from
the
darker
roast
on
it
and
drying
weirdly
i
get
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
there
too
though
and
finally
a
huge
blast
of
hops
from
the
pine
family
with
plenty
of
bitterness
the
flavor
is
a
lot
like
the
nose
the
rye
is
dominant
and
aggressive
almost
clumsily
so
overcoming
whatever
interesting
saison
yeast
might
be
in
this
beer
its
a
straight
up
rye
bomb
lots
of
hops
too
which
is
strange
in
a
saison
like
this
i
dont
taste
red
malt
but
i
can
feel
its
sweetness
trying
to
fight
the
bitter
of
the
hops
but
it
cant
contend
the
is
a
robustly
flavored
brew
that
could
perhaps
be
toned
down
a
bit
especially
for
it
to
show
any
signs
of
being
a
saison
apparently
upright
does
open
fermentation
which
is
cool
of
course
but
ti
does
very
little
for
this
overzealous
brew
fuller
bodied
spicy
and
bitter
a
strange
swallow
and
mouthfeel
bubbly
enough
i
respect
it
but
i
wont
buy
it
again

i
order
this
every
time
i
can
at
the
brewery
or
elsewhere
around
town
and
it
never
gets
old
amazing
with
almost
any
food
especially
fatty
meats
burgers
one
of
those
beers
that
is
just
as
good
on
a
snowy
day
as
it
is
on
80f
and
sunny
days
spectacular
and
i
hope
upright
brews
another
batch
with
cherries
added
soon
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
but
tamarind
is
not
something
i
would
want
as
the
dominant
flavor
in
my
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
doubt
i
would
revisit
pours
jet
black
with
nice
tan
head
more
complex
than
i
remember
from
previous
tastes
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
slight
tartness
are
in
the
forefront
but
are
followed
by
a
long
dry
aftertaste
that
is
reminiscent
of
match
heads
and
sulfur
oddly
enough
this
is
not
unpleasant
complex
many
flavor
notes
but
the
mineral
aftertaste
is
perhaps
the
most
distinctive
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
underneath
rich
flavors
of
dark
fruits
coffee
and
caramel
so
much
going
on
here
a
pleasant
enough
ryetinted
saison
the
heady
caramel
maltiness
sort
of
cutting
through
the
middle
with
the
proclaimed
titular
yeast
and
spicy
grain
falling
by
the
wayside
once
theyve
spent
their
load
more
saison
chicanery
from
this
portland
upstart
which
while
interesting
is
starting
to
mess
with
my
impression
of
the
style
im
ready
for
something
else
now
methinks
pours
with
a
big
fluffy
head
of
white
foam
on
top
of
a
hazy
golden
body
the
head
settles
slowly
and
leaves
excellent
lace
a
spicy
peppery
aroma
with
a
touch
of
clove
and
coriander
some
grainy
malt
and
spicy
yeast
with
pepper
and
clove
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
sweet
finish
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
the
yeast
character
is
unpleasant
and
there
really
isnt
anything
else
going
on
overly
sweet
pretty
good
beer
but
i
must
confess
and
be
completely
honest
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
rye
beer
thats
ever
lived
so
my
expectations
for
this
beer
werent
too
high
to
begin
with
still
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
when
you
consider
the
relative
amount
of
rye
that
makes
up
the
flavor
profile
ill
be
excited
to
soon
try
the
rest
of
this
upright
series
that
is
four
five
and
seven

the
beer
pours
a
burnt
orangebrown
color
with
a
couple
inch
light
tan
head
that
actually
kept
growing
slowly
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
initial
pour
it
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
settle
down
before
i
could
start
drinking
it
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
yeasty
and
fruity
it
smells
like
pears
ryedark
bread
herbs
cloves
and
apples
the
brew
tastes
like
dark
breadrye
pears
apples
cloves
caramel
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
is
well
carbonated
the
carbonation
is
soft
which
helps
make
it
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
in
the
future

a
bottle
reminds
me
of
jester
kings
commercial
suicide
but
stronger
bottle
poured
a
dark
dirty
brown
color
ale
with
a
generous
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
light
spicy
notes
and
some
herbal
notes
are
also
discernable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
caramel
malt
with
light
chocolate
presence
some
spicy
notes
probably
originating
from
the
rye
with
some
herbal
notes
and
dry
at
the
end
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
somewhat
dryer
then
i
was
expecting
with
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
different
perhaps
from
what
i
had
expected
but
very
good
and
worth
a
try
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
not
bad
but
pales
a
bit
in
comparison
to
the
other
upright
offeringd
i
have
enjoyed
so
much
this
has
potential
i
am
just
not
completely
sold
on
this
particular
batchbottle
i
opened
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
wish
the
hops
were
toned
down
a
tad
to
better
allow
the
malt
to
take
a
more
dominant
placement
there
are
a
lot
of
nice
malts
here
and
they
work
well
with
each
other
but
the
hops
easily
overpower
those
subtleties
this
is
likely
my
midwest
bias
for
a
bier
from
the
west
coast
this
is
surprisingly
balanced
o
very
interesting
beer
all
around
and
was
pretty
tasty
as
well
overall
i
was
really
impressed
by
uprights
vi
i
was
surprised
by
all
of
the
flavors
throughout
and
by
the
overall
complexity
i
expected
this
to
a
light
sessional
saison
with
some
rye
and
it
ended
up
being
a
dark
robust
and
complex
rye
beer
with
saison
and
porterlike
qualities
together
i
am
able
to
get
the
three
other
saisons
from
upright
and
i
cant
wait
to
purchase
them
and
try
them
as
well
i
decided
to
start
on
vi
because
ive
feeling
a
nice
rye
beer
ever
since
fall
came
around
this
was
right
up
my
alley
and
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
in
the
future
overall
surprisingly
good
is
it
a
rye
beer
is
it
a
saison
i
dont
care
its
delicious
overall
the
worst
upright
ive
had
maybe
its
an
old
bottle
but
theres
not
bottle
date
on
it
not
pleasant
and
wheres
the
rye
3

d
its
hard
to
pick
one
between
five
and
six
as
which
one
i
like
better
they
are
both
tasty
but
they
are
fully
different
this
has
some
good
flavors
but
is
missing
something
in
the
taste
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
another

taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
hmmm
a
rye
beer
this
doesnt
really
strike
me
as
such
in
an
american
sense
of
the
definition
the
first
thing
i
thought
when
looking
at
it
and
catching
the
fragrance
was
it
seems
like
a
dark
belgian
ale
upon
tasting
it
id
have
to
say
it
seems
to
follow
that
suit
ill
judge
this
one
on
the
quality
of
the
beer
but
as
a
rye
it
falls
short
to
me
still
very
nice
to
drink
o
an
interesting
beer
but
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
the
dark
sour
flavors
in
the
finish
were
a
bit
offputting
o
a
nice
interesting
beer
fairly
complex
with
a
range
of
flavors
overall
the
rye
is
big
in
this
saison
but
it
almost
overtakes
the
saison
it
was
still
pretty
enjoyable
beer
by
upright
very
drinkable
beer
right
here
worth
seeking
out
if
you
think
a
rye
saison
sounds
tasty
thanks
4daloveofstout
o
the
nice
hop
flavors
are
soft
but
they
dont
have
a
lot
of
support
from
other
flavors
and
i
dont
get
any
saison
yeast
character
it
is
not
offensive
in
any
way
just
a
bit
drab
especially
compared
to
the
bottle

smell
is
of
rye
caramel
touch
of
spice
the
different
smells
blend
together
nicely
and
create
a
pleasant
aroma
in
the
taste
i
first
detect
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
fruit
sweetness
i
later
get

of
rye

a

it

with

the
flavor
profile
is
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of
funk
for
a
saison
lover
like
me
this
would
make
for
a
great
wintertime
beer
for
someone
who
isnt
necessarily
into
portersstouts
brown
dark
amber
lingering
amber
head
big
malty
aroma
but
theres
some
oxidation
flavorful
malt
light
fruit
watery
uh
not
the
best
im
guessing
this
may
taste
different
at
the
brewery
fresh
on
tap
decent
and
i
can
find
intrigue
but
not
something
i
could
do
more
than
a
pint
of
without
finding
fatigue
still
tasty
and
fun
a
tasty
interesting
rye
saison
though
the
overbearing
fruit
sweetness
doesnt
make
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
liked
it
drank
the
whole
750ml
bottle
without
any
problems
an
adequate
but
undistinguished
rye
ale
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
great
big
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
chalky
with
wheat
and
rye
notes
the
flavor
is
malty
but
with
a
big
wheaty
bite
and
a
very
dry
rye
finish
rather
chalky
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
astringent
and
dry
overall
im
not
digging
this
but
its
not
terrible
either
huge
complexity
on
this
one
that
doesnt
quite
mesh
together
oddly
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
lots
of
goodness
in
here
though
good
beer
flavorful
well
crafted
yet
relatively
simple
if
not
rustic
in
many
ways
something
of
a
thirst
quencher
despite
being
fairly
dark
do
this
beer
has
plentiful
complexity
as
well
as
appeal
combining
varied
elements
of
dark
malt
rye
and
wild
ale
yeast
qualities
musty
wood
and
sugar
impurities
outmaneuver
simplistic
cider
in
a
prorustic
campaign
leaping
well
over
any
assumptions
or
expectations
one
might
bring
with
them
this
is
a
beer
for
the
jaded
palate
overall
a
rich
flavorful
and
interesting
brew
extremely
tart
and
woody
very
nice
pretty
interesting
beer
overall
this
beer
was
consumed
after
a
minor
seal
break
and
over
a
couple
days
the
initial
beer
was
served
cold
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
allowed
to
warm
the
flavours
and
aromas
evolved
but
never
disappointed
the
next
day
after
deciding
to
try
to
finish
the
bottle
which
we
used
a
wine
pump
on
the
beer
was
flat
but
still
good
lacking
in
carbonation
we
felt
it
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
good
sht
get
it
and
see
for
your
selves

pretty
average
but
drinkable
maybe
this
line
was
not
clean
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
nice
focus
on
the
rye
without
overdoing
it
which
is
important
it
is
definitely
rye
dominant
for
sure
so
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
rye
beers
this
wont
be
for
you
but
as
a
fan
of
rye
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
the
bruerys
rugbrood
which
is
the
staple
for
rye
beers
in
my
opinion
so
this
beer
is
in
the
top
echelon
for
me
for
the
style
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
theres
something
wrong
about
this
to
me
it
really
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
pleasant
characters
as
it
should
the
characters
it
has
are
thin
weedy
and
not
fullyfledged
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
love
the
rye
notes
mixed
with
the
saison
yeast
overall
good
but
somewhat
dissapointing
o
great
drinking
beer
has
nice
complexity
but
doesnt
over
power
the
taste
buds
the
combination
of
rye
and
fruit
tartness
is
nice
feel
is
solid
medium
bodied
somewhat
creamy
yet
also
prickly
from
the
carbonation
drink
a
nicely
balanced
rye
beer
i
am
beginning
to
want
to
get
my
hands
on
a
lot
of
rye
and
this
was
a
great
beer
to
have
around
the
house
big
bottle
big
flavors
and
a
good
abv
level
o
overall
a
good
rye
beer
the
nose
was
a
little
too
spicey
and
the
rye
dominates
but
i
enjoyed
it
would
try
it
again
worth
a
try
as
it
isnt
something
you
come
across
from
other
breweries
overall
a
very
solid
rye
ale
that
is
quality
yet
drinkable
bravo
pretty
good
but
too
much
focus
on
the
rye
and
not
enough
on
the
yeast
a
solid
rye
beer
with
a
great
aroma
the
flavour
doesnt
stand
up
quite
as
well
but
this
thing
is
thoroughly
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
really
enjoy
this
interpretive
saison
from
upright
the
rye
and
the
darker
malt
character
really
takes
this
in
a
great
direction
it
may
not
be
a
unique
direction
but
it
is
certainly
well
executed
and
quite
tasty
in
the
glass
even
though
i
have
liked
this
from
the
beginning
it
is
still
growing
on
me
more
as
it
warms
up
and
i
work
my
way
through
this
beer
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
upright
beer
of
the
few
i
have
tried
so
far
not
bad
at
all
a
lot
of
rye
beers
i
try
are
ipa
style
so
this
was
a
real
nice
switch
big
thumbs
up
on
the
six
d
definitely
a
unique
take
on
the
style
with
some
definite
saison
characteristics
poking
through
the
rye
not
sure
if
this
is
for
the
better
but
i
enjoyed
the
experience
nonetheless
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
as
rye
beers
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
was
nice
for
the
style
flavorful
and
nice
to
partake
on
a
hot
sunny
afternoon
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
try
the
others
from
upright
overall
i
liked
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
the
tartness
of
it
which
reminded
me
of
a
sour
in
a
lot
of
ways
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
and
i
would
do
so
again
lots
of
stuff
going
on
with
this
one
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
balanced
but
it
was
really
tasty
t
i
get
a
hint
of
the
rye
upfront
with
a
hint
of
citrus
then
a
bit
of
tartness
that
reminds
me
of
underripe
apricots
and
cherries
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
finish
as
well
this
was
pretty
well
done
and
unlike
any
beer
ive
tried
before
o
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
upright
definitely
their
best
of
the
series
i
will
never
miss
a
chance
to
grab
a
bottle
of
this
no
problem
tearing
a
whole
750ml
bottle
apart
myself
great
stuff
d
this
is
a
good
beer
wont
be
one
of
my
regulars
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
poured
a
murky
deep
roasted
chesnut
brown
with
a
fizzylike
beige
colored
head
big
sour
cherrylike
aromassherry
vinegar
and
some
wood
come
thru
as
well
i
gotta
admit
i
was
looking
for
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
on
the
palatethey
are
both
there
but
far
underneath
the
sherry
vinegar
tart
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
and
fizzyits
full
on
tart
and
thats
ok
for
what
it
isi
personally
would
have
liked
more
complexity
to
the
beer
tasty
spicy
and
chocolatey
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
upright
makes
a
lot
of
sours
and
odd
ducks
so
they
probably
have
plenty
of
strange
yeast
and
bacteria
floating
around
i
just
wish
theyd
say
if
they
intended
to
include
brettanomyces
or
if
its
just
an
afterthought
otherwise
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
is
on
its
way
to
being
spoiled
has
some
interest
and
lovely
to
look
at
but
i
find
it
virtually
undrinkable
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
easy
drinking
complex
and
balanced
another
great
beer
from
upright
verdict
good
closing
in
on
great
beer
thats
just
a
tad
too
expensive
worth
trying
better
than
expected
working
through
the
private
importsbottle
at
volo
way
overcarbonated
which
we
handled
by
creating
an
exeptional
head
dark
coloured
body
yielding
a
taste
fruity
lemoney
peppery
chocolate
some
rye
caramel
decent
malting
easy
drinking
average
mouthfeel
cheers
d
i
drank
a
750ml
and
enjoyed
it
over
two
hours
including
with
a
meal
and
i
wish
i
would
have
had
more
nice
bitter
aftertaste
this
one
is
a
great
offering
and
a
nice
slow
drinker
try
one
d
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
here
but
the
grain
bill
isnt
really
able
to
distinguish
itself
a
great
sipper
and
an
interesting
use
of
saison
yeast
pours
a
rich
brown
colour
that
show
mahogany
in
the
light
fluffy
off
white
head
good
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
faint
alcohol
spicy
rye
rich
malty
presence
there
is
almost
too
much
going
on
in
the
nose
so
some
things
are
conflicting
here
the
taste
is
sour
upfront
some
funky
presence
malt
comes
back
in
bringing
spicy
notes
cherry
and
some
dark
chocolate
show
up
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
but
perfect
good
carbonation
holds
itself
well
this
drinks
almost
like
a
good
wine
outstanding
stuff
here
this
was
very
unique
to
me
i
have
never
had
a
sour
rye
beer
great
intro
to
it
though
very
fine
beer
my
first
rye
beer
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
so
far
and
quite
good
balanced
tasty
and
refreshing
an
extremely
interesting
and
unique
offering
from
upright
i
dont
think
it
would
be
a
regular
go
to
for
me
but
certainly
a
fun
one
to
try
more
than
happy
to
drink
it
again
emphasis
on
local
organic
sourcing
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amberish
brown
color
with
a
massive
foamy
light
tan
head
that
takes
forever
to
dissipate
and
leaves
thick
patchy
clumps
of
lacing
pleasant
mild
aroma
of
spice
fruit
yeasty
esters
smoke
bread
etc
as
the
beer
warms
the
aroma
takes
a
turn
for
more
smoke
and
spicy
bread
wow
the
flavor
is
a
fun
unique
trip
melding
a
funky
french
style
saison
with
a
dark
malty
rye
ale
the
front
of
the
palate
is
coated
by
dark
fruits
and
chocolately
malt
while
the
back
is
gripped
by
funk
and
yeast
with
spicy
rye
bread
notes
medium
thick
with
light
carbonation
producing
a
creamy
smooth
body
with
a
mild
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
a
very
enjoyable
unique
rye
beer
whose
weakest
point
is
its
mouthfeel
highly
recommended
ill
be
seeking
more
out
d
very
good
shared
with
my
wife
but
could
have
consumed
this
one
solo
rather
easily
over
all
this
was
a
bit
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
rye
beer
as
i
feel
it
really
had
quite
dominating
saison
characteristics
with
the
addition
of
some
richer
malt
and
rye
notes
to
accentuate
the
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
was
a
slight
change
of
pace
without
having
to
analyze
an
entirely
foreign
style
of
beer
d
another
nice
saison
from
upright
the
addition
of
rye
in
this
one
added
a
nice
complexity
to
the
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownishred
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
dark
malts
and
rye
the
flavor
is
wheat
pepper
candi
sugar
and
rye
i
dont
get
the
same
fruit
characters
in
the
flavor
as
i
got
in
the
aroma
high
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
great
a
very
tasty
beer
that
washed
down
food
well
and
stood
on
its
own
too
a
great
drink
and
a
nice
change
from
the
normal
recommended
bottle
opened
with
a
bit
of
gunsmoke
pour
resulted
in
a
large
duvellike
rocky
head
slow
dissipation
with
significant
lacing
black
opaque
body
with
tan
head
the
house
yeast
is
pretty
prevalent
in
the
nose
caramel
malts
floral
hops
the
rye
is
very
nuanced
taste
is
of
raisins
light
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
spice
with
a
dab
of
funk
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
dry
finish
not
a
heavy
beer
but
one
shared
bottle
is
enough
for
one
night
not
really
a
sessionable
style
besides
the
visual
characteristics
i
though
the
bottle
version
had
more
character
probably
due
to
bottle
conditioning
im
curious
how
this
would
cellar
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
just
to
look
atthe
complex
taste
is
a
bonus
d
i
could
easily
go
for
another
bottle
right
now
the
6
7
does
rear
its
head
but
never
bites
an
interesting
beer
from
an
interesting
brewer
i
cant
wait
for
more
d
have
had
this
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
since
its
an
upright
staple
will
certainly
have
it
many
more
times
pairs
wonderfully
with
meat
and
smokier
dishes
drinks
well
on
its
own
even
pairs
superbly
with
a
peaty
aged
scotch
firsthand
experience
a
beautiful
beer
one
i
heartily
recommend
still
i
really
enjoyed
the
buoyant
quaffable
body
and
found
the
beer
refreshing
in
an
informal
sense
its
exotic
enough
to
inspire
intrigue
yet
informal
enough
for
casual
appreciation
i
had
three
glasses
of
this
at
the
brewery
poured
by
alex
himself
reviewed
from
notes
on
my
phone
served
in
an
old
gabf
flute
glass
color
is
a
mix
between
a
dark
orange
and
a
copper
hue
big
1
12
inch
off
white
creamy
head
that
stuck
around
a
few
minutes
lacing
towards
the
top
aroma
was
full
of
rye
and
the
best
smelling
beer
of
this
style
i
have
ever
come
across
also
had
esters
toasted
malts
spices
yeast
mild
sweetness
and
candied
sugars
grassy
accents
light
hops
and
grains
flavor
starts
off
with
rye
some
malt
that
is
both
toasted
and
sweet
in
the
middle
finish
has
more
rye
to
go
along
with
some
nice
floral
hops
a
bit
of
grass
and
lemon
lingering
the
aftertaste
as
well
very
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
chewy
malty
and
dry
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
high
level
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
forever
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
alcohol
at
all
in
the
flavor
balanced
and
smooth
refreshing
and
the
prickly
carbonation
makes
it
go
down
even
easier
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
whole
trip
and
the
best
from
upright
it
is
my
buddy
drakes
favorite
hands
down
he
is
still
talking
about
almost
a
month
later
highly
recommended
pours
a
murky
deep
copper
that
has
bright
edging
and
a
frothy
khaki
colored
head
that
never
really
disappears
and
leaves
a
thick
head
on
this
beer
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
has
yeast
esters
and
some
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
sweet
malt
candi
sugars
and
some
grassy
hops
the
bodied
is
light
to
medium
and
is
almost
fluffy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
it
was
tasty
easy
drinking
and
hid
the
abv
quite
well
but
if
youre
going
to
seek
this
out
then
youd
better
be
into
smoked
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
since
those
are
the
dominant
flavors
more
of
a
smoke
beer
with
rye
elements
to
me
but
still
a
nice
variation
on
several
styles
with
good
use
of
all
the
ingredients
involved
that
made
for
a
complex
and
flavorful
brew
a
noble
idea
marred
by
a
beer
that
cuts
a
straight
line
down
the
center
of
mediocre
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
beer
poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
jet
black
with
a
big
fluffy
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
after
a
bit
leaving
awesome
rings
of
lacing
smell
is
roasted
malt
slight
coffee
sweet
chocolate
soft
rye
grain
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
bitter
coffee
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
spicy
grainy
rye
mixed
in
with
it
all
the
rye
grain
adds
an
extra
dimension
to
the
mouthfeel
which
is
on
the
thinner
side
for
a
stout
but
the
carbonation
makes
up
for
it
3
5
d
im
going
to
try
to
dissipate
the
carbonation
for
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
but
i
had
to
review
it
the
way
it
was
o
a
very
nicelooking
and
feeling
stout
and
very
drinkable
but
a
little
too
mellow
and
dry
in
the
taste
o
perhaps
my
first
rye
stout
rye
is
omnipresent
but
the
nice
mellow
roasted
malt
provides
a
nice
counterbalance
and
complementary
flavor
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
well
done
o
this
beer
is
thin
but
pleasant
tasting
with
it
could
use
a
bit
more
character
or
depth
it
drinks
pretty
quick
but
one
pint
is
enough
chewy
palate
indeed
but
not
overwhelming
a
smooth
chewy
palate
makes
for
a
nice
session
stout
good
roasted
malt
flavors
dark
coffee
and
black
rye
bread
crust
the
finish
is
just
a
little
tinny
good
beer
overall
would
buy
again
thought
this
would
be
more
of
a
stout
but
feels
like
a
complex
porter
complex
malty
profile
thats
easy
to
drink
beer
takes
a
whole
to
settle
in
and
pick
up
the
complex
flavors
awesome
o
overall
a
good
beer
even
though
the
presentation
was
bland
and
nothing
special
the
taste
was
very
nice
and
the
mouth
feel
was
even
better
really
enjoyed
this
i
didnt
come
here
to
try
this
but
now
that
i
did
ill
be
back
for
more
ill
admit
my
wariness
going
into
this
what
with
the
incredible
sadness
caused
by
things
bearing
the
name
repo
man
eg
the
genetic
opera
repo
men
etc
still
giving
it
a
whirl
though
it
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
molasses
somehow
it
just
smells
sorta
dry
the
taste
holds
notes
of
toasted
rye
bread
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
sourdough
and
once
again
that
little
hint
of
molasses
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
stout
though
it
comes
off
just
a
notch
too
thin
for
my
preference
beyond
that
though
good
times
overall
drinkability
excellent
rye
beer
labeled
a
rye
stout
hard
not
to
enjoy
this
if
you
think
that
sounds
good
would
have
again
over
and
over
this
was
a
really
good
rye
beer
there
was
a
good
amount
of
malts
on
both
the
aromas
and
flavors
bigger
without
being
too
big
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
a
little
rye
can
make
a
great
beer
this
is
expertly
crafted
smooth
and
ridiculously
delicious
i
will
definitely
be
ordering
another
pint
revolution
does
it
again
recommended
o
awesome
this
brew
encompasses
everything
that
i
love
in
a
stout
its
big
bodied
massively
roasted
incredibly
rich
and
overall
delicious
d
really
the
best
thing
i
have
had
at
revolution
and
that
is
saying
something
many
rye
beers
just
dont
get
it
right
but
this
one
does
complex
spicy
and
delicious
d
gets
a
touch
bitter
and
fatiguing
after
a
pint
or
so
but
otherwise
thoroughly
enjoyable
is
this
the
base
beer
for
bad
man
if
so
i
think
i
prefer
it
before
it
hits
the
barrels
another
fine
offering
from
revolution
in
any
case
o
really
great
beer
i
destroyed
my
glass
of
this
and
went
back
for
more
a
few
weeks
before
sitting
down
and
enjoying
a
pint
of
this
beer
i
tried
a
flight
of
revolution
beers
this
beer
stood
out
to
me
for
one
reason
the
finish
the
first
couple
drinks
finish
almost
totally
clean
like
a
good
dry
red
wine
there
is
a
heavy
roast
and
rye
taste
the
beer
is
20
rye
but
it
does
not
bog
the
flavor
or
your
taste
buds
down
about
half
way
through
to
the
last
leg
of
the
beer
you
find
that
a
roasty
taste
has
built
up
in
your
mouth
if
the
glass
was
any
bigger
you
might
find
that
the
taste
becomes
too
much
but
they
have
built
the
beer
just
right
that
you
finish
before
you
throw
the
towel
in
this
beer
is
a
perfect
firstbeerofthenight
because
while
it
still
has
flavor
and
style
your
palate
washes
clean
with
a
glass
of
water
beg
borrow
or
steal
to
get
some
if
you
can
this
is
a
beer
worthy
of
seeking
out
i
had
this
both
on
tap
and
on
cask
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
blood
red
highlights
a
light
tan
head
poor
lacing
ok
retention
the
aroma
is
really
sweet
figs
and
rye
complex
and
intriguing
the
taste
is
noting
short
of
awesome
and
insanely
awesome
malty
caramel
and
dark
fruits
then
out
of
nowhere
awesome
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
nuts
unreal
thick
and
lasting
feel
so
easy
to
drink
by
far
the
best
beer
cibak
has
done
to
date
coming
it
coming
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
thin
creamy
head
pungent
smell
dark
rye
very
strong
with
hops
and
rye
dominating
the
malty
carmel
taste
resulting
in
an
bold
hoppy
taste
that
lingers
for
a
while
high
b
16oz
can
pours
rubychestnut
in
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
holds
great
retention
and
leaves
thick
chunky
lacing
on
the
glass
impressive
aromas
are
malty
caramel
peppery
rye
citric
hop
tastes
seem
to
be
muddled
very
earthy
rye
herbal
fresh
dank
hops
resinous
citrus
evergreen
full
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
rather
chewy
yet
oily
and
resinous
alcohol
is
very
well
concealed
for
9
overall
like
i
said
earlier
i
want
to
like
this
more
i
feel
like
the
hops
could
be
brighter
and
stand
out
more
it
just
seems
to
be
too
one
note
for
me
its
not
bad
at
all
but
just
seems
to
be
missing
something
o
this
is
a
strange
beer
i
love
great
river
and
i
love
everything
about
this
beer
except
its
taste
but
thats
a
pretty
important
parttheres
just
something
not
quite
right
for
my
taste
here
o
this
is
the
4th
beer
i
have
had
in
the
4pack
and
the
one
i
am
reviewing
i
have
to
say
this
beer
has
kinda
grown
on
me
its
something
different
which
at
first
i
didnt
like
but
now
i
have
to
say
i
do
overall
this
beer
is
different
the
herbal
quality
and
the
sweetness
do
go
hand
in
hand
to
make
a
unique
palate
of
flavors
i
feel
this
beer
would
be
hit
or
miss
with
most
people
if
you
want
to
try
a
hoppy
pale
why
not
hop
a
potamus
great
river
brewery
hopapotamus
pours
a
very
dark
clear
chestnut
brown
with
red
edges
and
a
bubbly
light
brown
head
the
nose
is
interesting
its
a
bit
light
but
there
is
some
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
there
is
a
nice
rye
spice
between
the
malt
and
hop
transition
as
oily
resinous
citric
hop
the
taste
has
the
pronounced
rye
with
chocolate
malts
accompanying
fairly
roasted
with
a
lighter
hop
presence
than
the
nose
basically
just
a
light
citrus
and
faint
bitterness
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
lighter
carb
but
soft
feel
pretty
enjoyable
balance
here
o
aroma
raised
expectations
but
flavor
was
a
let
down
overall
a
pretty
solid
rye
beer
definitely
drinks
like
a
dipa
very
hoppy
i
dig
it
one
can
at
a
time
however
too
sticky
o
labeled
correctly
as
a
rye
beer
instead
of
an
ipadipa
the
hops
though
they
mix
well
with
the
spicy
malts
arent
really
at
the
forefront
on
my
palate
nice
beer
anyways
notes
interesting
beer
doesnt
fit
perfectly
in
a
style
for
me
but
it
is
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
off
but
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
enjoying
the
beer
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
the
can
tells
a
great
tale
that
the
beer
doesnt
back
up
too
much
farmland
soil
for
me
pretty
good
but
wont
be
a
repeat
buy
pours
a
copper
red
with
a
healthy
cap
of
tan
head
slow
steady
beading
and
good
lacing
the
nose
is
earthy
with
layers
of
citrus
like
fresh
squeezed
tangerine
all
smothered
in
caramel
theres
quite
a
pine
bite
on
the
tongue
that
transitions
through
rye
and
toasted
grains
drawn
out
bitter
afterburn
overall
this
beer
isnt
perfect
but
its
complex
enough
to
keep
things
exciting
o
very
drinkable
with
the
abv
well
hidden
its
rich
and
hoppy
with
loads
of
rye
hops
and
spices
well
done
delicious
massive
three
finger
tan
head
sits
atop
a
reddish
brown
body
retention
and
lacing
are
slightly
better
than
average
smell
is
mostly
rye
hop
flavors
come
out
on
the
tongue
wanna
say
citrus
and
pine
in
there
but
taste
is
dominated
by
spice
from
the
rye
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
and
almost
watery
which
is
weird
with
the
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
can
a
little
oily
and
a
dry
spice
finish
overall
this
is
a
decent
rye
beer
that
i
will
probably
buy
again
overall
i
was
impressed
such
a
complex
meld
of
flavors
gave
me
a
very
pleasant
experience
i
will
definitely
be
getting
more
if
possible
if
you
love
hops
try
this
something
unique
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
rye
and
spice
notes
taste
is
the
same
with
some
herbal
and
medicinal
hop
flavors
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
very
muddled
and
somewhat
dirty
taste
overall
this
was
previously
categorized
as
an
ipa
here
which
is
totally
wrong
no
matter
what
the
can
says
this
is
a
heavier
rye
beer
thats
hopped
not
an
ipa
with
rye
solid
rye
flavor
and
a
decent
hop
back
but
its
not
anything
special
certainly
not
the
best
rye
beer
on
the
shelves
but
no
others
are
priced
6
99
for
four
pints
either
o
this
beer
is
a
home
run
i
wish
it
were
easier
to
find
because
i
would
be
drinking
this
a
looot
more
often
came
out
of
the
blue
and
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
because
the
can
looked
cool
and
the
unusual
sticker
over
a
plain
can
feel
works
very
nicely
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
find
some
more
of
this
sometime
from
the
name
i
was
expecting
a
pure
hop
monster
but
instead
this
is
a
malt
attack
with
a
big
hop
balance
i
like
that
its
hefty
without
being
too
sweet
although
it
still
could
be
a
bit
more
refined
not
sure
the
price
on
this
thing
since
my
buddy
sent
it
to
me
but
i
imagine
its
a
good
bang
for
your
buck
actually
thinking
about
it
more
this
beer
reminds
me
alot
of
arrogant
bastard
if
you
like
that
then
you
will
probably
like
this
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
it
fits
nicely
into
the
rye
ipa
field
or
in
this
case
rye
iipa
and
its
drinkability
is
terrific
there
is
not
possible
way
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
9
drinks
more
like
a
67
beer
both
of
the
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
have
been
outstanding
they
are
putting
out
some
very
impressive
things
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
drinkability
the
can
says
hopapotamus
will
charge
if
provoked
frankly
i
think
that
is
more
of
a
recommendation
than
a
warning
this
is
definitely
a
beer
you
want
to
provoke
p
s
tried
this
againg
a
few
months
later
to
see
how
it
had
aged
not
bad
but
not
nearly
as
good
drink
this
fresh
a
very
thick
and
dense
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
for
a
dipatype
brew
but
it
does
not
distract
nothing
too
overly
exciting
about
this
beer
but
it
is
very
solid
and
enjoyable
o
i
will
be
back
for
this
over
and
over
like
i
said
top
three
of
all
time
if
your
into
hop
heavy
brews
or
rye
pas
find
this
beer
and
enjoy
so
good
just
be
careful
makes
you
want
to
chug
and
at
9
the
buzz
hits
ya
a
bit
quicker
and
it
tastes
like
it
smells
nicely
woody
with
that
crisp
rye
flavor
thats
kinda
like
a
very
mellow
very
zippy
oak
its
nice
but
like
i
said
it
kinda
overrides
everything
else
can
barely
taste
the
titular
hops
rye
spice
compliments
the
hop
profile
rather
well
i
feel
like
this
is
a
bit
underrated
because
it
isnt
a
tropical
citrus
bomb
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
well
brewed
ale
the
taste
also
has
a
grainy
grassy
taste
with
that
lemon
bite
quite
a
quaffable
brew
and
well
made
the
rye
having
just
a
bit
more
flavor
profile
would
enhance
the
beer
but
otherwise
i
enjoy
this
one
o
the
perfumy
hops
need
something
to
balance
them
out
clean
refreshing
light
hoppy
and
a
revelation
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
from
new
england
taste
doesnt
linger
too
long
on
palate
o
this
was
great
not
overly
complex
but
a
good
light
and
dry
rye
ale
would
make
a
great
barbecue
sixer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
notable
not
worth
the
higher
price
per
bottle
3
overall
a
very
crisp
and
aromatic
pale
ale
the
rye
is
noticeable
in
the
flavor
but
less
so
in
the
aroma
with
a
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
overall
an
interesting
pale
alerye
beer
with
a
lot
more
lime
taste
to
it
than
i
had
anticipated
the
rye
is
there
but
it
is
faint
i
have
had
better
from
this
brewery
but
i
would
not
turn
this
down
o
starts
out
decent
but
goes
downhill
fast
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
the
use
of
rye
adds
a
twist
of
spiciness
to
the
finish
the
beer
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
yellow
highlights
the
beer
forms
a
smooth
creamy
white
head
of
medium
sized
bubbles
and
it
is
replenished
by
a
maelstrom
of
bubbles
racing
up
like
an
upside
down
snow
storm
to
replenish
the
snowy
head
the
head
sits
at
a
healthy
fingers
width
above
the
beer
and
it
does
not
fade
away
ever
it
leaves
a
lacing
of
fat
clouds
made
up
of
tightly
knit
dry
bubbles
this
beer
is
pretty
to
look
at
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
juicy
pine
with
hints
of
grapefruit
and
a
subtle
rye
spice
that
hints
at
grainy
bread
the
hop
smell
also
gives
off
surprising
hints
of
juicy
citrus
moving
from
orange
to
slight
pineapple
and
then
back
to
grapefruit
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
dry
and
bitter
with
some
light
acidity
and
only
the
faintest
kiss
of
sugar
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
light
spicy
rye
with
lovely
grapefruit
accents
which
eventually
eat
up
the
light
rye
flavors
and
move
into
a
juicier
flavor
with
hints
of
pine
the
finish
returns
to
big
beautiful
rye
flavors
with
pine
accents
that
work
together
beautifully
and
slightly
suggesting
bell
pepper
flesh
on
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
a
tingly
sense
of
rye
malt
and
slight
bitter
hops
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
phenomenal
carbonation
that
provides
a
lovely
fluffy
scrub
to
the
tongue
and
keeps
this
beer
nicely
dry
and
sippable
the
mouth
is
left
dry
but
clean
with
some
slight
spittle
forming
from
the
hop
acids
oddly
this
light
spittle
seems
to
help
quell
the
bitters
of
this
beer
and
balance
it
nicely
overall
this
is
a
lovely
flagship
beer
and
a
really
nice
lawnmower
beer
as
well
they
need
to
throw
this
thing
into
cans
or
a
six
pack
so
that
people
can
sip
it
in
canoes
or
on
top
of
mountains
this
is
just
a
solid
american
hopforward
rye
beer
it
is
a
little
harsh
on
the
hops
overall
and
some
more
rye
character
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
but
overall
i
like
this
good
beer
glad
i
shared
this
7
bomber
with
a
buddy
because
i
didnt
find
the
11
oz
in
my
glass
all
that
inviting
when
i
dont
look
forward
to
the
next
sip
with
anticipation
i
know
it
isnt
a
beer
ill
spend
my
money
on
a
second
time
first
impression
is
dry
and
bitter
the
starting
malt
is
muted
relatively
thin
the
aftertaste
lasts
a
long
timepeppery
bitterness
the
beer
pours
a
clear
watery
looking
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
halo
of
head
that
offers
mild
lacing
the
nose
is
a
touch
spicyhoppy
with
a
sweet
backbone
however
the
flavor
brings
forth
a
lot
more
rye
and
hops
that
play
off
eachother
to
create
a
spicybitter
phenomenon
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
sweet
initially
that
transitions
into
a
bold
spicy
bitterness
there
is
a
lingering
sweet
hoppy
aftertaste
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
less
citrusforward
hopped
rye
of
the
tiger
the
beer
is
worth
trying
once
but
its
not
worth
another
pint
22oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
color
there
is
a
bit
of
a
foamy
offwhite
head
on
it
decent
nose
piney
hops
are
the
most
prevalent
some
floral
notes
also
the
taste
is
also
good
a
bit
bitter
with
no
real
sweetness
pine
as
well
as
some
spiciness
a
medium
malt
body
id
have
another
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
especially
if
your
a
fan
of
rye
beers
overall
good
beer
if
you
are
just
getting
into
ipas
this
is
one
to
start
out
on
it
gives
a
good
overall
ipa
flavor
without
the
huge
punch
of
intense
hops
odfar
better
than
their
ipa
a
hoppy
pale
with
plenty
of
rye
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
less
expensive
for
a
bomber
but
overall
i
am
happy
with
the
purchase
o
this
is
a
great
american
pale
ale
the
marriage
of
rye
and
a
nice
spicy
hop
profile
is
a
harmonious
one
the
brewers
werent
afraid
to
get
a
little
creative
here
but
they
didnt
stray
too
far
from
the
style
the
result
is
a
beer
that
colors
outside
the
lines
a
bit
but
still
retains
that
classic
apa
feel
tasty
nuanced
and
creative
great
stuff
finally
tried
the
daymark
last
night
i
think
ive
found
a
rye
beer
i
like
daymark
is
an
exceptionally
well
made
beer
with
great
balance
the
earthy
bready
rye
comes
through
but
it
is
still
a
crisp
drinkable
ale
all
rising
tide
beers
are
made
with
a
lot
of
care
and
it
is
no
surprise
that
daymark
is
their
flagship
beer
as
an
apa
this
was
ok
there
was
a
metal
after
taste
that
did
not
appeal
to
me
reminded
me
of
sam
adams
noble
pils
browned
orange
with
a
big
white
head
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
has
some
lighter
orangeycitrus
notes
grainy
breads
rye
and
some
sweeter
bready
malt
character
taste
has
a
drying
grainy
rye
bread
character
bitter
citrus
notes
and
light
cracker
and
spicing
medium
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
bitterness
is
overpowering
to
the
point
where
it
detracts
from
the
beers
an
ok
pale
but
bittering
is
too
aggressive
for
my
liking
in
the
style
fresh
bottle
from
maine
the
rye
and
the
centennial
and
columbus
combined
make
this
a
very
bitter
beer
even
astringent
would
like
to
distinguish
the
rye
spiciness
if
i
could
the
bottle
says
a
pale
its
not
that
it
is
more
malty
with
sediment
on
the
bottle
and
grows
on
me
as
far
as
drinkability
but
it
is
also
a
palate
eraser
and
harsh
o
a
great
anytime
beer
and
nearly
perfect
for
the
warm
weather
the
hops
and
rye
malt
compliment
each
other
extremely
well
i
will
look
for
this
beer
again
as
well
as
others
from
rising
tide
brewery
o
this
is
a
good
beer
i
have
been
enthralled
by
the
appearance
i
would
have
this
again
i
will
ask
this
is
this
a
rye
beer
or
an
american
pale
ale
whatever
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
if
you
see
this
beer
on
the
shelf
grab
it
youll
be
pleased
with
it
a
lot
of
good
pale
ales
coming
out
of
maine
as
of
late
daybreak
is
equally
as
good
as
spring
peeper
mo
and
its
other
hoppy
pale
ale
neighbors
pours
dirty
bronze
with
2
inches
white
foam
quite
puffy
laces
a
lot
pine
and
grass
nose
spicy
lemony
lighter
malt
taste
with
a
subtle
hop
some
bitterness
hangs
out
at
the
end
quite
mellow
but
with
full
flavor
light
rye
in
the
background
that
would
almost
be
missed
if
not
written
up
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
on
top
i
tried
to
pour
this
as
slowly
as
possible
but
it
didnt
seem
to
matter
i
gave
the
head
some
time
to
settle
before
pouring
the
rest
of
the
bottle
in
the
glass
the
head
had
a
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
lemony
the
rye
gave
off
a
nice
little
spice
note
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
also
the
rye
and
citrus
seemed
to
go
pretty
well
together
the
other
flavors
of
grains
balance
the
beer
out
a
little
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
and
had
a
nice
crisp
bite
in
the
finish
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
if
you
enjoy
rye
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
but
i
felt
that
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
i
would
say
its
worth
trying
i
cant
say
that
id
buy
it
again
though
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
the
rye
flavors
really
came
out
in
it
pretty
solid
beer
overall
the
feel
on
this
is
great
22oz
bomber
purchased
at
trader
joes
in
portland
me
pours
a
very
hazy
yellowamber
body
with
a
good
inch
of
persistent
offwhite
head
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
orange
grapefruit
and
pulp
notes
orange
pulp
lemon
with
strong
spice
notes
from
the
rye
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
rye
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
and
i
didnt
realize
at
first
that
thats
what
this
beer
is
that
said
its
pretty
good
and
among
the
best
rye
beers
ive
had
o
this
was
a
unique
take
on
a
rye
beer
mixed
with
a
pale
a
great
aroma
and
appearance
but
though
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
definitely
worth
trying
though
liked
this
one
the
hoppiness
of
the
brew
with
the
spicy
malt
really
made
this
a
good
one
this
is
a
summer
brew
this
should
be
a
yearrounder
and
since
i
bought
it
in
nov
it
looks
like
it
is
dark
pour
here
dark
garnet
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
on
top
slow
receding
left
tons
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
really
gave
it
a
very
nice
and
very
complete
look
aroma
is
huge
lots
of
spice
at
first
caramel
molasses
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
earth
deep
hops
warming
brings
out
some
touches
of
dark
fig
like
fruit
notes
but
nothing
like
that
warm
rye
touch
that
really
adds
to
it
as
i
take
the
first
sip
a
really
wave
of
caramel
and
light
peppery
rye
hit
the
tongue
light
notes
of
chocolate
that
come
over
it
wave
after
wave
really
quite
complex
and
i
have
to
admit
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
still
very
well
done
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
rye
beer
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
my
wife
said
is
has
a
nice
little
zing
to
it
and
i
agree
the
citrus
notes
and
light
sweetness
accent
rather
than
cut
or
drown
the
bold
hops
out
recommended
o
nice
surprise
here
its
a
very
enjoyable
balance
of
hops
and
malts
would
definately
buy
this
again
so
far
all
the
rising
tides
ive
sampled
are
solid
would
continue
to
buy
from
this
brewery
overall
i
love
this
one
dry
floral
light
in
the
mouth
local
ingredients
a
great
beer
keep
it
up
up
there
in
maine
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
could
be
great
if
the
finish
fit
the
rest
of
the
sip
a
little
bit
better
lots
of
fun
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
loved
this
only
beef
is
the
massive
head
in
the
pour
o
overall
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
a
great
pale
ale
with
a
subtle
hop
forward
sweetness
overall
a
solid
beer
a
little
less
carbonation
and
a
little
less
from
the
hops
and
this
would
be
a
home
run
that
being
said
it
is
enjoyable
as
is
and
i
wouldnt
mind
throwing
back
a
bunch
of
these
a
greatlooking
and
smelling
beer
but
just
too
unbalanced
for
my
taste
in
pale
ales
d
would
happily
drink
another
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
pale
ale
with
a
lot
of
grapefruit
character
plus
the
bottle
logo
is
pretty
cool
picked
up
a
bomber
back
in
may
while
visiting
kennebunkport
poured
into
a
stemmed
beer
glass
way
over
carbonated
it
foamed
way
up
in
the
glass
and
while
i
was
tending
to
that
it
spewed
out
of
the
bottle
and
all
over
the
table
unfortunate
once
it
settled
down
i
was
able
to
continue
hazy
sunshine
yellow
color
with
a
fine
white
head
smell
had
a
pungent
aroma
of
tangy
hops
taste
was
excellent
lots
of
spicy
hops
but
a
bit
of
malt
to
help
things
out
then
a
nice
dry
crispness
at
the
end
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
very
fresh
and
assertive
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
and
was
glad
to
try
except
for
the
overflow
accident
overall
wow
i
am
a
fan
this
is
easily
the
best
rye
beer
ive
had
although
it
tastes
like
a
very
distinct
american
ipa
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
plenty
refreshing
for
a
nice
summer
rye
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
beer
from
rising
tide
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
i
love
a
good
rye
beer
but
have
been
rather
disappointed
with
many
ive
had
recently
so
im
glad
this
one
came
along
o
on
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
id
want
the
rye
keeps
me
from
drinking
too
many
but
its
incredibly
refreshing
and
a
great
rye
pale
ale
definitely
bringing
a
bomber
or
two
of
this
home
with
me
pretty
impressive
nothing
is
out
of
proportion
balance
is
key
a
touch
of
rye
a
touch
of
hops
a
touch
of
sweetness
gone
a
floral
juicy
pale
that
serves
as
a
nice
addition
to
the
maine
beer
scene
what
a
surprise
to
find
such
a
unique
flavor
and
delicious
beer
most
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
last
year
have
been
small
unknown
local
breweries
add
this
one
to
the
list
highly
recommended
thank
you
mr
matazz
pours
a
hazy
wheat
color
the
color
of
golden
raisins
with
a
tight
stark
white
head
that
laces
a
bit
but
doesnt
cling
the
head
settles
quickly
the
dry
hopping
gives
a
good
whiff
of
hops
up
front
herbal
and
fruity
a
clean
crisp
ale
that
hits
you
with
a
wall
of
bitterness
bitters
linger
deeply
in
the
dry
finish
herbal
dry
hops
with
an
alcohol
kick
initially
it
was
a
bit
much
but
you
settle
into
it
and
begin
to
look
forward
to
the
next
bitter
wave
a
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
this
enjoyable
to
drink
for
some
reason
im
thinking
of
bitter
white
grape
juice
fermented
with
stems
rugged
hop
oil
residue
coats
the
mouth
peppery
spicyness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
lingers
along
with
the
dry
hop
a
complex
concoction
well
the
first
fault
comes
right
off
at
the
start
body
is
a
bit
low
ill
attribute
this
to
the
rye
carbonation
is
nice
and
does
make
up
for
a
lot
of
it
theres
a
solid
hoprye
bitterness
that
bites
at
your
pallate
finish
is
a
bit
harsh
in
the
bitterness
but
its
still
tasty
and
fairly
easy
drinking
decent
feel
here
this
one
is
a
little
sticky
and
the
body
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
like
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
this
is
actually
a
little
dissapointing
i
have
some
bottle
of
their
other
offerings
so
im
hoping
those
go
better
damn
this
one
kind
of
broke
my
heart
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
so
the
next
batch
that
i
see
ill
give
it
another
go
ill
rereview
if
i
need
to
another
very
solid
beer
from
rising
tide
i
like
that
they
brew
accessible
beers
with
their
own
little
twist
on
things
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
quaffable
if
you
will
a
great
amount
of
flavor
for
only
being
5
5
if
they
sold
this
in
a
six
pack
and
actually
where
i
live
i
would
for
sure
get
some
of
these
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
nice
hoppy
apa
rising
tide
does
it
again
i
really
love
this
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
that
goes
well
with
the
rye
malt
hoppy
pale
with
rye
sounds
right
up
my
alley
pours
bright
yellowy
orange
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
nice
thick
white
head
lacing
the
glass
on
the
way
down
aromas
of
floral
hops
fresh
fields
and
bread
the
hops
are
very
up
front
here
grassy
bitter
soapy
even
very
dry
this
is
backed
by
a
nice
doughy
and
yeasty
body
with
nice
bit
of
spice
and
heft
from
the
rye
addition
and
a
slightly
fruity
finish
crisp
and
light
on
the
palate
with
just
the
right
bitter
smacking
definitely
my
fav
of
the
three
so
far
from
this
new
maine
brewery
as
a
local
fresh
beer
this
one
is
top
notch
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
this
summer
and
though
the
beer
lends
itself
well
to
summer
months
i
dont
think
it
would
be
unwelcome
at
cooler
times
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
checking
out
overall
a
good
beer
nice
to
have
on
a
hot
day
d
another
winner
for
rising
tide
nice
crisp
easy
drinking
pale
with
a
twist
mouthfeel
is
top
notch
the
rye
adds
a
nice
amount
of
body
to
a
beer
that
you
wouldnt
expect
to
have
after
seeing
the
color
carbonation
is
perfect
and
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
each
sip
leaves
you
with
rye
flavor
that
lingers
for
a
while
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
with
the
perfect
amount
of
rye
flavor
and
smell
a
nice
beer
very
autumnal
appreciate
that
while
this
is
a
full
flavored
beer
the
oak
aging
and
spices
arent
overdone
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
rye
ale
from
a
dependable
maine
brewer
autumn
seasonals
are
full
of
browns
marzens
and
pumpkins
and
its
nice
to
see
a
slightly
spicy
rye
in
the
mix
for
a
change
of
pace
good
stuff
the
taste
also
has
those
malts
and
hops
but
there
is
an
added
minor
spice
bit
if
the
label
did
not
say
autumn
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
standard
pale
ale
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
strongly
foamy
910
and
slightly
smooth
110
seems
a
bit
foamy
for
the
beer
and
style
a
bit
more
smoothness
would
benefit
this
ale
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
coating
the
palate
o
its
ok
not
my
favorite
beer
at
all
could
benefit
from
more
balance
12oz
can
duckfat
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
there
was
a
large
frothy
tan
head
on
it
almost
no
lacing
it
has
a
nice
nose
spice
pine
and
rye
notes
the
taste
is
very
good
rye
spice
hint
of
pine
perhaps
a
touch
of
orange
and
ginger
a
touch
bitter
very
nice
over
all
this
is
a
very
good
beer
although
i
felt
the
pine
like
flavor
from
the
hops
was
a
bit
too
forward
and
made
this
brew
somewhat
off
balance
however
the
underlying
deep
flavors
added
a
complex
and
likeable
beer
the
malt
came
through
and
added
some
sweetness
the
finish
was
somewhat
bitter
which
i
like
and
left
no
lingering
after
taste
i
would
not
make
this
my
every
day
drink
but
i
will
be
happy
to
have
this
in
my
refrigerator
in
the
autumn
overall
one
of
the
better
autumn
ales
i
have
had
overall
this
beer
lacks
definition
i
cant
say
it
is
off
style
because
its
merely
a
unique
take
on
the
general
fallbeer
theme
but
it
does
seem
muddled
and
confused
and
some
ingredients
that
are
supposed
to
be
in
this
beer
are
not
distinguishable
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
i
will
finish
the
6
pack
but
i
sure
wont
buy
it
again
i
say
its
best
to
drink
this
with
a
hearty
meal
rather
than
on
its
own
this
brew
shows
a
murky
haze
of
rusty
brown
with
a
stout
tanish
head
and
goodly
gobs
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
malty
mulled
apple
with
hints
of
light
lemon
hop
it
definitely
sets
the
stage
for
those
october
days
the
flavor
brings
more
bright
yeasty
bread
over
the
same
cider
malt
with
woodsyleafy
characteristics
and
a
dry
grass
finish
i
get
some
ideas
of
nutmeg
and
tea
and
hints
of
orange
clove
its
medium
bodied
with
delicate
but
purposeful
carbonation
that
provides
a
good
bit
of
tongue
tingle
and
refreshment
for
those
football
afternoons
and
brisk
autumn
winds
very
woodsy
crisp
and
flavorful
nice
job
baxter
an
easy
to
drink
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
very
malty
overall
pretty
solid
rye
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
bunch
this
year
and
last
the
can
aspect
is
good
for
those
warm
and
cool
fall
days
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
more
like
hoppy
american
red
ale
with
hints
if
mulling
spices
and
touch
of
toasty
oak
but
still
more
of
an
average
craft
beer
and
very
light
nose
spices
orish
could
have
cut
in
more
maybe
mix
up
the
malts
a
bit
something
to
at
least
bring
a
specific
character
out
rather
than
a
mundane
american
red
ale
with
hints
if
something
that
could
have
made
it
more
unique
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
almost
opaque
rubycopper
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
dense
offwhite
head
that
starts
around
an
inch
and
a
half
and
slowly
settles
into
a
half
an
inch
that
remains
for
the
duration
of
the
brew
slightly
hazed
body
gives
the
appearance
of
opaqueness
aromas
of
a
maltbomb
rich
roasty
caramel
and
nut
with
a
subtle
grainy
underlying
character
smells
pretty
good
flavors
are
hop
forward
surprisingly
with
a
resiny
and
bitter
backbone
that
supports
the
grainy
and
malty
profile
tangy
and
sweet
caramel
with
a
roasting
characteristic
blended
with
some
pepper
spices
from
the
hops
the
malt
profile
is
a
bit
restrained
compared
to
the
nose
providing
a
little
more
breathing
room
for
the
hops
presence
resiny
and
peppery
aftertaste
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
at
the
very
end
slick

finish
with
a
clean
slightly
drying
feel
the

is
a
bit
lighterwatery
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
on
the
pour
but
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
tasty
easy
to
drink
not
what
you
might
expect
but
it
hits
the
spot
the
ginger
citrus
and
spicy
flavors
ontop
of

for
a
nice

very

poured
from
the
can
into
a
pint
glass
murky
orange
red
body
with
a
white
head
smell
has
piney
and
citruslike
taste
was
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
the
can
says
it
has
all
these
spices
in
it
plus
its
aged
on
oak
i
didnt
get
any
of
that
all
i
tasted
was
a
hoppy
amber
ale
that
tasted
like
all
their
other
beers
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
crisp
which
was
on
par
for
a
rye
beer
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
just
kind
of
a
letdown
because
i
wanted
more
flavor
a
beer
of
ostentatious
vs
mild
bright
vibrant
hops
vs
mild
and
mellow
oak
spicy
rye
vs
subtle
honey
sweetness
its
a
bit
messy
but
i
like
it
most
of
the
time
this
was
way
too
sharp
for
me
i
think
a
little
bit
of
rye
goes
a
long
way
and
this
was
a
bit
over
the
top
i
really
like
how
this
beer
is
malty
but
dry
and
the
spices
dont
overpower
far
and
away
the
best
baxter
offering
ive
had
when
you
get
a
clean
can
or
pour
of
baxter
the
beer
is
solid
4
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
a
great
fall
rye
ipa
nice
body
and
warmth
complexity
and
balance
defiantly
give
this
one
a
go
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
aroma
unfortunately
its
all
over
the
place
what
starts
out
with
caramel
malt
soon
is
hit
with
other
flavors
like
ginger
rye
pops
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
spicy
hop
character
sharp
carbonation
with
a
surprisingly
soft
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
alright
nothing
super
special
but
surely
not
bad
im
sure
there
are
other
seasonals
ill
enjoy
more
though
odcool
set
of
flavors
to
put
other
for
an
autumn
brew
may
be
a
bit
too
ambitious
because
none
of
the
flavors
really
stand
out
baxter
has
some
interesting
brews
and
this
one
fits
in
with
their
collection
they
just
didnt
really
nail
it
with
this
one
kudos
to
baxter
for
trying
things
outside
the
box
o
this
is
a
nicely
complex
brew
that
captures
the
season
well
perfect
for
the
cooler
weather
and
as
always
with
this
brewery
easy
to
transport
in
the
canned
format
o
another
great
beer
by
baxter
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
rjt
its
quick
and
bone
dry
finish
is
given
a
compelling
creamy
dryness
that
keeps
the
ale
supported
even
in
its
fleeting
moments
hop
bitterness
seems
exacerbated
by
the
bite
of
rye
grain
elevating
both
to
utmost
proportions
an
aftertaste
of
dried
citrus
and
peppercorn
linger
on
clean
clear
copper
color
the
head
is
very
thin
and
fizzy
rye
malt
nose
rye
malt
flavor
this
a
properly
called
a
rye
ale
the
feel
is
incredibly
thin
almost
watery
nothing
particularly
remarkable
about
it
but
it
certainly
presents
itself
as
what
it
is
a
rye
ale
o
love
rye
beers
and
i
love
this
one
drank
in
canton
june
21st
2014
great
look
and
taste
got
this
on
sale
at
ingles
today
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
amberhighlighted
copper
coloring
with
a
frothy
foamy
offwhite
head
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
action
throughout
the
body
aromas
of
hops
first
and
foremost
with
a
resinous
blast
moss
and
pine
and
some
subtle
tropical
fruit
all
on
a
roasted
and
slightly
bitter
grain
backbone
flavors
are
more
of
the
bitter
and
pungent
rye
forward
with
a
bitterness
around
the
edges
from
the
hops
resinous
notes
and
citrus
highlights
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
endfeel
the
aftertaste
has
a
bit
more
of
the
citrus
notes
coming
to
the
palate
with
the
bitter
grains
still
providing
a
solid
foundation
the
finish
has
a
grainy
and
citrus
linger
not
bad
overall
very
balanced
and
the
light
body
keeps
it
refreshing
ive
been
on
a
rye
love
affair
for
the
past
few
months
with
both
beer
and
whiskey
so
maybe
my
review
is
overinflated
but
if
you
enjoy
rye
and
all
that
it
brings
give
this
one
a
try
very
affordable
too
a
new
brewery
for
me
looks
good
off
the
pour
its
kind
of
a
mild
rye
nothing
overly
abrasive
or
way
out
there
easy
drinking
and
smooth
enough
nice
level
of
spice
from
rye
minimal
hop
abrasive
tones
like
i
said
easy
drinkin
this
could
be
an
every
day
ale
i
wouldnt
mind
some
more
punch
out
of
it
but
its
pretty
good
as
it
is
pours
amber
brown
with
red
around
the
edges
and
a
small
soapy
head
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
spice
with
a
dash
of
dish
soap
smell
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
and
a
tinge
of
pine
flavor
very
much
highlights
the
rye
spicey
black
pepper
some
pine
bite
bit
of
dark
dry
fruit
with
serious
dry
finish
has
some
qualities
of
a
dubbel
but
without
much
sweetness
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
finishes
dry
very
true
to
the
rye
here
and
does
not
go
all
ipa
on
you
like
a
lot
of
rye
pales
do
i
respect
that
pours
a
dark
copper
body
supporting
just
over
an
inch
of
bone
white
foam
that
recedes
relatively
quickly
leaving
some
thin
rings
of
lacing
aroma
consists
predominantly
of
herbal
spicinessbrown

mild

with
a
roughedged
hop
bitterness
and
an
almost
tinny

finish
lightly
resinous
overalla
mediocre
hoppy
rye
beer
in
my
opinion
o
nothing
too
complex
but
it
is
effective
in
its
execution
drinkable
enjoyable
and
flavorful
isnt
that
all
that
matters
nice
ipa
not
world
class
but
enjoyable
o
rye
is
present
but
not
outlandish
balanced
well
with
the
hops
but
neither
flavor
is
powerful
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
rye
beers
for
me
only
founders
reds
rye
and
the
lenny
bruce
beer
from
hebrew
showcase
rye
as
well
as
rye
hopper
does
pair
this
with
some
great
music
at
the
french
broad
tasting
room
and
you
have
a
perfect
combo
o
solid
rye
beer
with
a
lot
of
hop
punch
color
is
a
dark
shade
of
amber
nearly
brown
head
is
average
but
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
herbal
floral
and
malty
and
pleasing
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
maltforward
nutty
and
bready
with
rye
also
playing
a
big
role
adding
spiciness
and
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
hop
flavors
are
in
the
background
and
are
mainly
floral
i
think
it
would
benefit
from
more
citrus
hop
flavors
to
provide
better
balance
its
a
decent
rye
but
not
a
memorable
one
o
an
average
rye
beer
o
a
very
enjoyable
ale
balanced
and
flavorful
great
for
a
cool
evening
light
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
and
relatively
drinkable
overall
not
a
showstopper
but
a
decent
offerning
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
with
a
medium
to
thin
body
modest
but
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
should
be
consumed
with
a
meal
overall
the
rye
hopper
was
a
beer
very
different
from
what
im
used
to
and
pleasantly
surprising
the
bitter
sweet
flavor
was
a
winner
for
me
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
presence
up
front
that
is
countered
by
a
sweet
slightly
roasted
malt
backbone
hints
of
caramel
rye
toast
and
dark
fruit
slight
creamy
texture
with
a
dry
finish
hoppier
and
more
complex
than
expected
well
balanced
and
easyto
drink
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
brewery
that
i
was
unfamiliar
with
o
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
good
combination
of
bready
malt
rye
and
bitter
hops
i
just
wish
the
rye
were
a
little
stronger
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
style
d
a
good
bomber
to
share
plenty
of
flavor
but
not
extreme
o
not
something
id
really
look
to
have
again
not
my
kind
of
beer
couldnt
find
a
date
to
confirm
but
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
at
this
point
arrived
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
peppery
rye
taste
is
predominantly
rye
but
with
a
nice
malt
balance
the
rye
sits
on
the
tongue
and
offers
a
good
bite
but
isnt
overpowering
reminds
me
of
a
good
pastrami
sandwich
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
i
dont
think
i
could
have
too
many
of
these
at
once
but
this
one
was
good
overall
a
really
soli
rye
beer
a
bit
hoppier
then
most
d
definitely
a
very
nice
beer
that
walks
the
fine
line
between
american
pale
ale
and
rye
beer
not
the
best
in
either
category
but
very
nice
offering
none
the
less
more
hops
than
rye
which
as
a
rye
beer
lover
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
a
great
value
at
sub
5
per
bomber
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
some
good
soft
rye
spice
to
compliment
the
hops
but
the
only
real
hops
flavor
is
a
strong
pungent
bitterness
and
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
finish
funk
on
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitter
and
the
rye
sticks
on
the
end
overall
a
very
tasty
rye
beer
i
got
this
in
a
recent
trade
but
i
cannot
remember
who
sent
it
to
me
thank
you
whoever
you
are
dark
amber
color
but
not
brown
and
yet
not
orange
smells
pretty
nondescript
i
was
expecting
hops
given
the
label
the
label
also
led
me
to
believe
i
would
taste
rye
in
this
beer
but
i
got
almost
none
of
it
i
did
get
a
bit
of
oxidation
though
overall
this
was
quite
an
average
beer
not
bad
but
not
special
at
all
pours
a
clear
brown
with
some
nice
soapy
bubbles
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
the
rye
some
floral
hops
some
lemon
and
some
spiciness
taste
is
mostly
rye
with
a
nice
touch
of
floral
hops
bready
with
some
light
spiciness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
thin
almost
a
dry
finish
with
the
rye
coming
back
in
the
finish
pretty
strong
im
not
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
it
isnt
something
i
would
go
for
all
the
time
but
when
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
the
rye
hopper
would
do
the
trick
a
good
beer
but
probably
not
something
id
choose
again
did
i
mention
that
i
love
this
beer
o
a
solid
beer
would
have
liked
a
little
more
rye
spice
in
the
flavor
profile
but
i
liked
it
a
nice
first
beer
for
me
from
french
broad
pours
a
clear
darker
amber
with
half
inch
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
ring
and
leaves
a
few
splotches
of
lace
smell
spicy
and
slightly
sour
rye
a
little
citrus
rind
bready
taste
spicy
rye
grapefruit
toasty
with
a
little
toffee
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
soft
creamy
carbonation
nice
easy
drinking
offering
a
good
thirst
quencher
crisp
and
sharp
d
quite
drinkable
tasty
good
things
dok
but
nothing
too
special
pours
a
slightly
murky
orangish
red
a
good
amount
of
white
head
that
hangs
around
smells
great
hoppy
and
rye
heavy
very
similar
to
nugget
nectar
in
the
hop
profile
similar
to
reds
rye
in
a
lot
of
ways
tastes
sweet
and
a
bit
bitter
with
the
hop
presence
thick
solid
moouthfeel
very
tasty
overall
a
bit
thin
but
would
definitely
drink
it
again
md
smooth
medium
carbonation
packing
a
ton
of
flavor
at
only
5
9
this
beer
has
nothing
to
hide
excellently
crafted
almost
sessionable
too
overall
impression
fans
of
rye
should
definitely
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
that
is
almost
mahogany
malty
aroma
has
a
rye
overtone
and
hoppy
and
yeasty
hints
strongly
hoppy
flavor
has
a
firm
rye
tone
and
only
a
little
bitterness
texture
is
rough
fizzy
and
ragged
this
one
is
a
joy
to
drink
if
you
like
a
firm
sassy
earthy
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
flavors
from
the
malts
and
hops
as
a
rye
fan
the
heaping
hops
seem
to
crowd
the
stage
nonetheless
rye
hopper
is
a
delicious
rye
beer
which
pours
some
extra
spice
into
the
otherwise
hidden
malt
base
mild
body
has
a
very
crisp
opening
dry
finish
and
middle
for
what
its
worth
and
mild
lingering
potential
in
the
cracks
and
crevices
of
my
mouth
drinks
easy
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
probably
wouldnt
suggest
this
as
the
be
all
end
all
rye
beer
though
french
broad
has
a
good
thing
going
on
with
this
one
rye
is
showcased
without
going
overboard
at
5
9
abv
not
only
is
it
tasty
is
goes
easy
on
the
palate
recommended
like
many
of
the
asheville
beers
ive
had
it
is
more
timid
than
it
need
be
still
i
would
happily
put
another
down
on
a
warm
summer
day
on
the
beach
this
is
my
first
beer
from
french
broad
brewing
company
and
im
damn
impressed
rye
hopper
has
a
ton
of
flavor
crammed
into
a
small
package
the
only
small
complaint
i
have
is
that
the
carbonation
might
be
a
tad
high
its
not
so
noticeable
since
the
bubbles
feel
small
but
the
head
is
annoying
yes
im
nitpicking
it
i
know
excellent
beer
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
thanks
a
ton
dan
d
moderate
drinkability
this
beers
ryeness
is
probably
good
to
style
but
not
good
for
sessioning
a
bit
abusive
to
the
tongue
could
be
more
balanced
higher
carbonation
can
be
filling
lots
of
hops
with
a
nice
rye
i
find
this
highly
quaffable
d
a
pleasant
drinkable
beer
body
is
light
but
substantial
enough
to
carry
the
flavor
nicely
drinkable
im
impressed
with
this
offering
not
a
knockout
by
any
means
but
a
solid
quaffable
ale
that
takes
advantage
of
the
rye
quality
i
should
seek
out
more
rye
beers
this
is
interesting
d
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
im
still
learning
what
i
like
and
may
have
to
revisit
this
one
day
when
my
experience
grows
good
crisp
clean
mouth
fair
carbonation
refreshing
finish
the
rye
really
makes
itself
known
in
the
flavor
grainy
start
but
gives
way
to
slight
souring
notes
and
a
dry
finish
ive
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
and
finally
pulled
the
trigger
im
not
sure
its
one
i
would
make
a
regular
buy
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
d
pretty
high
drinkability
although
as
this
warms
that
bitter
hops
become
a
little
too
pronounced
for
me
wow
this
one
exceeded
expectations
right
up
there
with
the
fantastic
reds
rye
from
founders
the
best
french
broad
brew
ive
had
to
date
this
is
my
first
french
broad
and
pretty
damn
tasty
i
think
this
does
well
as
the
medium
of
the
genre
would
lend
its
self
to
an
american
session
beer
though
purists
will
whine
due
to
the
5
9
abv
too
hard
core
you
know
bomber
from
bruisin
ales
asheville
this
brew
shocked
the
hell
out
of
me
i
loved
it
and
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
d
pretty
good
this
is
slightly
more
meaty
than
most
i
personally
liked
this
beer
it
was
a
nice
surprise
to
see
on
ingles
beer
shelf
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
rye
beer
at
first
whiff
this
beer
reminded
me
of
the
middle
ages
wailing
wench
so
being
a
hoppy
beer
with
my
guess
here
ringwood
yeast
character
and
duacetyl
after
the
initial
punch
of
butterscotch
candy
theres
richly
earthy
rye
layered
with
biting
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
hops
the
body
is
crisp
and
drinkable
and
overall
this
is
a
fine
and
interesting
rye
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
smells
a
bit
like
tomatoes
which
mind
you
i
tend
to
find
in
rye
ales
but
this
one
was
less
an
accent
and
more
pronounced
which
i
didnt
much
like
the
flavors
are
particularly
grassy
and
somewhat
cooked
which
makes
me
wonder
about
the
condition
of
the
bottle
mind
you
it
was
in
the
cooler
of
a
very
very
popular
beer
store
the
texture
itself
was
a
bit
washed
out
and
the
cooked
nature
of
the
finish
certainly
had
illeffects
on
the
drinkability
this
is
still
a
good
beer
if
you
can
try
to
get
over
that
aftertaste
but
id
recommend
it
from
the
tap
d
this
is
a
solid
rye
beer
it
had
a
nice
balance
between
not
only
between
its
malt
and
hops
but
between
the
profiles
withing
the
malts
and
hops
sweet
and
rye
malts
citrus
and
grassy
hops
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
one
bomber
of
this
clear
coppery
brown
in
color
aroma
carries
butterscotch
and
caramel
smells
like
a
candy
store
seriously
upon
tasting
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
and
floral
hops
make
their
immediate
presence
felt
a
mellow
bready
brown
sugar
taste
follow
ushering
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
back
into
the
finish
a
very
unexpected
and
delicious
beer
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
rye
beers
are
getting
to
be
my
favorite
style
overall
and
its
because
of
easy
drinkers
like
these
i
personally
liked
this
beer
and
could
have
finished
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
by
myself
no
problem
mouthfeel
is
rather
average
being
neither
offensive
or
spectacular
weight
is
about
what
one
would
expect
from
something
in
the
5ish
range
and
carbonation
is
just
enough
to
give
your
mouth
a
very
gentle
tickle
certainly
not
my
style
but
a
decent
beer
nevertheless
i
would
imagine
the
ipa
crowd
would
like
this
one
d
overall
a
very
good
rye
beer
well
integrated
mix
of
flavors
combining
into
a
complex
group
of
flavors
to
keep
things
interesting
and
balanced
alcohol
level
is
pretty
low
at
5
9
very
good
afternoon
drinker
hv
the
flavor
is
comes
with
a
big
bready
malt
flavor
that
has
an
awesome
grainy
edge
to
it
like
wheat
and
multigrain
bread
the
hops
come
in
balanced
and
humbly
to
add
a
sweet
edge
towards
the
end
of
the
profile
overall
this
is
great
rye
malt
that
could
stand
for
a
bit
more
hops
but
perhaps
the
terrapin
version
has
me
confused
because
this
too
is
a
great
rye
beer
that
offers
a
good
full
mouth
feel
and
a
beer
thats
well
crafted
and
traditional
d
good
rye
beer
think
i
may
get
a
keg
for
our
next
party
as
the
amber
option
good
hoppy
freshness
increases
the
drinkablility
drinkability
if
your
idea
of
an
excellant
beer
is
rye
and
hops
look
no
further
a
little
extra
surprise
in
flavor
as
well
love
the
low
abv
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
french
broads
offerings
well
crafted
flavorful
and
always
interesting
keep
up
the
good
work
great
drinkability
big
on
the
rye
malt
but
a
nice
hop
kick
to
please
just
about
any
beer
drinker
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
da
solid
easy
to
drink
and
pleasing
palate
stimulator
full
of
rye
dryness
spicy
zip
and
citrus
zing
well
done
and
flavourful
certainly
a
beer
i
could
drink
with
regularity
d
rye
hopper
is
a
really
flavorful
and
drinkable
rye
beer
and
is
quite
dry
and
spicy
with
more
of
a
hop
presence
than
i
was
expecting
my
first
experience
with
french
broad
and
i
was
not
disappointed
from
the
widely
lauded
cellars
of
ohoove
this
brew
has
a
dark
copper
color
pretty
clear
with
a
reasonable
offwhite
head
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
a
medicinal
buttery
rye
herbal
hop
with
some
malt
balance
the
flavor
brings
bright
grassy
rye
with
a
herbal
malt
base
i
get
some
raspberry
fruit
sweetness
but
its
subtle
good
drinkability
with
midbodied
feel
but
tangy
and
crisp
a
nice
brew
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
and
unique
character
a
nice
introduction
to
french
broad
if
you
like
the
sharp
edge
of
this
hop
brew
d
a
good
bomber
to
share
i
wouldnt
be
upset
if
another
one
showed
up
at
my
door
pours
from
the
bomber
to
a
hazy

with
thin

up
the

a
fairly
long
well
rounded
blend
of
the
hops

a
nice
from

the
rye
oh
the

doth
give

real
rye
bomb
its
a
different
taste
albeit
a
good
one
its
a
unique
flavor
that
i
can
see
myself
drinking
again
though
probably
not
more
than
one
in
an
evening
as
much
as
i
like
rye
i
didnt
love
this
one
might
pick
up
a
bomber
to
compare
but
wont
seek
this
one
out
this
is
really
quite
good
the
rye
flavor
is
very
pronounced
but
theres
enough
hoppiness
to
complement
and
balance
it
out
nicely
this
is
a
must
for
any
rye
fan
and
worth
trying
for
all
the
rest
of
us
too
t
drinkability
a
bomber
of
a
spicy
rye
is
hard
for
any
man
pours
a
deep
amber
color
moving
a
bit
to
brown
slightly
hazy
with
a
huge
head
kind
of
offwhiteyellow
colored
it
looks
a
little
loosely
packed
but
it
stays
around
leaving
nice
lacing
though
eventually
it
sort
of
collapses
to
a
pillowy
mass
and
then
sort
of
disappears
slowly
the
smell
comes
across
with
mostly
powdery
malts
and
quite
a
bit
of
rye
like
rye
bread
a
little
spicy
a
little
earthy
there
also
seems
to
be
some
spiciness
and
leafyearthiness
from
the
hops
as
well
otherwise
their
presence
is
mild
in
the
smell
something
smells
a
little
like
cinnamon
in
here
as
well
a
little
spicier
though
the
taste
comes
across
with
a
kick
of
herbs
like
herb
bread
with
cloves
and
a
bit
of
mint
some
basil
maybe
a
taste
of
garlic
actually
there
seems
to
be
a
little
heat
to
it
very
interesting
then
theres
a
kind
of
toasty
malt
presence
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
liek
caramellized
sugars
i
can
also
sense
a
bit
of
an
estery
presence
but
its
barely
there
theres
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
im
not
so
sure
i
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
im
really
enjoying
it
the
body
is
nice
and
full
almost
chewy
from
the
proteins
in
the
rye
makes
it
almost
hard
to
swallow
the
alcohol
warms
a
little
but
isnt
really
noticeable
the
carbonation
hardly
bites
but
you
can
feel
it
there
helping
to
rush
the
beer
down
really
enjoyable
its
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
not
because
of
some
strange
ingredient
but
just
because
i
havent
really
tasted
anything
quite
like
it
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
it
i
could
see
myself
purchasing
this
again
drinkability
is
good
very
enjoyable
nice
rye
notes
nice
hops
that
blend
with
the
fruitiness
want
to
thank
merlin48
for
lending
me
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
tea
color
with
a
nice
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
an
easily
recognizable
though
timid
peppery
rye
grain
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
full
flavored
the
peppery
taste
combine
for
a
lively
experience
that
finishes
on
the
dry
side
a
really
nice
drinker
and
at
less
that
6
abv
its
quite
a
session
beer
drinkability
sipper
by
far
this
beer
has
a
lot
hidden
within
a
stellar
beer
from
a
growing
beer
company
i
highly
recommend
the
drink
is
surprisingly
fullishin
body
with
a
silky
syrupiness
nicely
complemented
by
finegrained
carbonation
plenty
drinkable
drinkability
suffers
from
the
bitterness
the
beer
also
had
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
overall
it
appears
that
i
should
give
this
beer
another
shot
based
on
the
other
reviews
d
easy
to
drink
and
could
have
a
few
more
i
hope
this
isnt
taken
the
wrong
way
nothing
spectacular
but
just
a
good
allaround
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
on
hand
i
will
definitely
pick
more
up
next
time
in
nc
an
above
average
beer
d
very
very
drinkable
the
bombers
gone
in
15
minutes
im
very
partial
to
a
well
done
rye
ale
and
this
one
hits
the
mark
on
all
accounts
its
a
bit
too
filling
to
want
more
than
one
at
a
single
sitting
but
this
is
my
favorite
french
broad
product
to
date
well
done
drinkability
what
some
rye
course
ya
do
rye
hopper
maintains
a
more
than
pleasant
balance
between
the
sweetish
malts
and
the
spicy
rye
and
bitter
hops
pleasantly
drinkable
and
good
expression
of
rye
in
beer
though
i
will
admit
im
a
bit
partial
to
terrapins
rye
squared
lets
go
red
wings
highly
recommended
good
beer
at
a
good
price
even
though
ive
only
had
two
of
their
offerings
to
date
i
am
supremely
impressed
with
french
broad
brewing
company
altbier
was
delicious
and
drinkable
rye
hopper
is
even
more
so
if
you
love
rye
beer
and
hops
as
much
as
i
do
then
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
acquire
a
bomber
as
soon
as
possible
it
looks
like
north
carolina
is
rapidly
becoming
a
hotbed
of
great
craft
beer

d

abv
about
what
i
would
have
guessed
drinkable
with
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
an
interesting
brew
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
all
the
ipas
ive
been
drinking
lately
better
than
anything
else
ive
had
from
french
broad
i
like
it
this
is
the
first
french
broad
love
the
name
beer
i
have
ever
picked
up
the
rye
hopper
was
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
and
it
looked
darker
than
i
was
expecting
the
body
was
a
deep
shade
of
copper
and
clear
and
the
head
atop
was
foamy
i
did
not
see
any
carbonation
streamers
the
smell
was
sweet
and
fruity
which
is
odd
for
a
beer
named
rye
hopper
the
taste
was
also
sweet
and
mildly
bitter
the
bready
taste
was
followed
by
a
bit
of
spiciness
the
body
was
soft
but
this
beer
lacked
the
carbonation
to
make
it
feel
creamy
easy
to
drink
for
sure
but
not
the
most
memorable
beer
made
with
rye
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nice
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
in
decatur
ga
the
beer
was
hazy
dark
copper
color
thick
rich
looking
offwhite
head
lots
of
wet
lacing
on
the
glass
spicy
rye
and
earthy
hops
in
the
aroma
the
taste
had
a
nice
bite
of
rye
and
bitter
hops
caramel
malt
througout
but
the
spiciness
sets
the
overall
tone
very
good
as
drinkable
as
any
rye
beer
ive
had
to
date
note
i
tried
this
side
by
side
with
the
bottle
version
and
the
tap
version
is
thicker
with
a
cleaner
hop
flavor
definitely
try
ontap
if
possible
another
solid
beer
from
french
broad
so
nice
to
see
these
available
in
atlanta
now
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
with
very
little
head
and
relatively
low
carbonation
but
with
some
scant
lacing
left
behind
as
the
beer
is
drained
smells
of
spicy
rye
piney
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
fairly
well
balanced
in
the
nose
i
wouldnt
call
the
taste
balanced
but
its
delicious
nonetheless
starts
with
a
bang
with
a
big
blast
of
rye
and
piney
hops
intermingled
to
create
a
quite
spicy
dry
bitter
prickly
mouthfull
i
like
it
and
the
rye
and
the
hops
work
well
together
bone
dry
with
very
little
noticeable
malt
makes
this
almost
tannic
and
approaches
rye
whiskey
in
its
flavor
profile
without
the
burn
big
and
spicy
in
the
mouth
this
one
surprised
me
when
i
poured
it
after
working
in
the
yard
expecting
a
lawnmower
beer
that
it
is
not
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
its
a
bit
onedimensional
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
out
there
for
showcasing
the
beauty
of
rye
so
ill
forgive
it
its
singlemindedness
nice
ill
be
buying
this
again
overall
very
good
and
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
ryes
22oz
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
crisp
copper
with
a
decent
cream
head
aroma
is
a
nice
bit
of
rye
with
citrus
hops
right
behind
the
taste
is
a
nice
sharp
rye
bite
balanced
nicely
with
citrus
hops
the
beer
is
light
and
smooth
with
decent
carbonation
very
refreshing
this
is
certainly
a
great
beer
one
id
love
to
see
around
this
area
as
long
as
the
price
isnt
jacked
up
by
the
distributor
drinkability
a
damn
good
beer
in
my
opinion
and
one
of
the
few
rye
beers
ive
truly
enjoyed
id
glad
to
have
this
one
again
and
would
really
like
to
try
it
on
tap
manages
to
strike
all
the
right
notes
without
going
overboard
and
the
abv
seemed
low
enough
to
where
a
few
of
these
wouldnt
be
a
problem
recommended
overall
its
a
good
beer
that
you
should
give
a
try
if
you
have
the
chance
my
expectations
where
met
and
i
hope
this
was
not
a
one
off
d
very
smooth
balanced
and
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
nice
flavor
chocolate
and
rye
greet
the
tongue
immediately
medium
body
and
such
a
smooth
and
sweet
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
so
much
so
that
i
had
the
same
beer
in
two
different
places
well
done
md
very
dry
like
a
good
rye
beer
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
as
well
easy
drinking
but
not
the
best
rye
beer
i
have
had
still
not
sure
why
they
chose
to
highlight
hops
in
the
name
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
ive
had
mouthfeel
i
found
this
to
be
rather
bold
in
the
flavor
profile
mlaty
with
some
caramel
hops
are
medium
but
the
rye
oh
the
rye
doth
give
this
one
an
edge
me
likey
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
bitterness
ill
agree
with
the
previous
review
this
one
does
not
get
crazy
with
the
hops
but
the
rye
really
makes
it
a
bit
more
aggressive
on
the
palate
i
could
session
this
one
but
it
feels
like
it
might
have
an
abv
of
at
least
6
5
good
brew
this
one
is
a
brownish
hue
with
amber
and
ruby
shades
minimal
head
and
retention
isnt
the
greatest
smell
is
nice
but
not
what
i
had
expected
from
a
beer
with
hopper
in
the
name
bigger
on
the
malts
than
anything
some
caramel
chocolate
and
a
distinct
nutty
scent
very
light
to
no
hops
present
though
still
very
enticing
taste
is
much
of
the
same
reminds
me
of
the
malt
profile
of
many
catawba
valley
brews
a
definite
malt
presence
oh
so
yummy
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
a
good
nutty
flavor
to
compliment
a
hoppy
flavor
shows
up
toward
the
finish
but
could
have
done
wonders
if
used
a
bit
more
liberally
of
course
there
is
a
light
spicy
flavor
though
like
the
hops
not
as
present
as
i
had
imagined
still
very
nice
and
interesting
to
say
the
least
mouthfeel
lacked
the
bitterness
that
again
i
had
expected
from
the
name
alone
smooth
good
carbonation
though
lacking
a
certain
bitterness
from
the
hopper
in
the
name
i
could
have
a
couple
if
not
a
few
pints
of
this
a
good
beer
that
just
didnt
live
up
to
my
hop
head
expectations
i
still
want
to
give
it
another
go
incredibly
flavorful
and
only
4
4
yeah
its
pretty
clear
that
certain
musky
dank
hop
strains
so
favoured
by
brewers
all
up
and
down
the
west
coast
of
late
do
not
agree
with
me
that
said
this
is
still
a
pretty
enjoyable
rye
ale
the
adjunct
grain
doing
well
to
integrate
with
the
whole
while
the
other
hop
esters
prop
up
an
otherwise
lost
cause
serving
type
bottle
very
fruity
up
front
but
quickly
followed
by
a
dry
rye
taste
that
leaves
behind
a
bitter
bite
and
makes
you
thirsty
for
more
i
could
sip
on
this
one
for
a
long
time
easy
to
drink
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
a
spice
note
from
the
rye
and
citrus
and
floral
hop
notes
great
session
o
this
is
my
first
taste
of
a
rye
beer
and
i
was
impressed
this
is
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
flavor
very
refreshing
i
pissed
off
someone
i
didnt
know
on
facebook
today
for
repeatedly
misusing
the
word
socialism
good
fuck
go
look
it
up
so
my
day
was
already
made
but
hey
a
beer
makes
the
end
of
every
night
better
right
carbonation
really
does
no
favors
to
the
beer
still
pretty
good
overall
i
have
to
admit
i
am
starting
to
become
quite
the
fan
of
rye
beers
considering
an
equivalent
case
of
24
x
330ml
would
be
over
au180
however
i
think
i
will
take
a
brewcult
supa
fly
rye
ipa
most
days
and
save
the
gramarye
for
special
occasions
nice
moderate
carbonation
overall
very
nice
sessionable
rye
pale
i
really
want
to
like
it
more
considering
its
credentialing
but
it
seems
like
someone
turned
its
volume
down
muted
i
guess
to
be
fair
the
label
says
bottled
07
30
12
so
it
likely
has
already
passed
its
prime
im
going
to
look
for
it
on
draft
good
brew
interesting
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
brew
the
rye
is
subtle
but
broadens
the
palate
nicely
which
is
very
nice
often
rye
can
make
a
beer
sharper
and
spicier
but
here
it
provides
additional
width
of
character
very
nice
stuff
probably
one
of
the
best
of
heretics
ive
had
pours
a
golden
bronze
hazy
hue
with
a
creamy
three
finger
head
and
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
quite
light
with
aromas
of
spicy
ryeherbal
hops
and
a
touch
of
passionfruitthe
mouthfeel
is
just
over
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
passionfruitpeachesspicy
rye
and
finished
with
a
spicy
dryness
and
overall
its
abit
of
a
let
down
and
is
pretty
subdued
on
all
levels
but
nice
for
a
session
ale
cheers
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
this
at
barons
marketplace
in
san
diego
which
had
several
heretic
brews
all
of
a
sudden
6
for
the
rye
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
with
nice
rye
and
malt
notes
and
a
good
deal
of
balance
it
isnt
as
heavy
as
many
of
the
other
heretic
products
but
it
is
still
good
and
flavorful
in
its
own
way
and
its
a
product
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
taste
of
rye
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
session
beer
the
rye
flavor
really
fills
in
the
gap
most
session
beers
have
due
to
a
lack
of
grainmalt
there
is
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
without
being
too
bitter
drink
a
nice
beer
i
like
rye
and
have
been
looking
for
new
rye
beers
when
i
can
this
was
a
good
beer
to
unwind
on
a
sunday
with
this
is
a
very
nice
lower
abv
beer
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
into
that
4
4
abv
pours
a
pretty
orangey
amber
quite
clear
minimal
haze
aroma
is
mild
but
juicy
citrus
hops
on
top
of
some
rye
spice
and
some
caramel
maltiness
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
quality
in
there
somewhere
very
tasty
stuff
for
me
this
has
perfect
balance
for
this
sort
of
low
abv
amber
ale
it
starts
with
ryespicy
caramel
sweetness
and
sweet
orange
hop
flavor
and
then
dries
out
and
finishes
with
a
refreshing
bitterness
packed
with
pine
resin
and
rye
bread
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
creamy
and
smooth
it
compliments
the
flavor
very
well
and
is
surprisingly
fullbodied
for
the
beers
strength
great
stuff
ive
been
a
bit
disappointed
in
heretic
so
far
to
be
clear
i
had
my
expectations
very
high
but
this
beer
is
excellent
also
im
happy
to
see
another
tasty
low
abv
beer
d
very
drinkable
nice
hopp
rye
pale
ale
great
overall
balance
with
some
good

overall
a
good
pale
ale
made
with
rye
no
faults
a
good
easy
drinking
ale
think
this
is
good
just
not
great
cask
on
tap
very
good
overall
there
were
so
many
beautiful
things
about
this
beer
from
the
look
to
the
nose
it
introduced
itself
and
presented
itself
well
the
first
whiff
brought
crashing
imagery
of
nugget
nectar
to
the
forefront
of
our
minds
although
the
flavoring
showed
much
more
bitterness
from
both
the
hops
and
the
big
rye
grain
inclusions
the
hops
became
frankly
soapy
and
when
mixed
and
indistinguishable
from
the
malts
gave
a
doubled
bitter
blend
that
was
cleaner
but
equally
as
robust
as
your
west
coast
bitter
hop
bombs
veryvery
tasty
the
only
negative
thing
about
this
one
was
its
heavier
feel
and
flow
but
we
suppose
that
is
seasonally
reasonable
and
only
minor
given
the
wonderfully
fresh
ingredients
aroma
and
taste
this
beer
surprised
me
i
got
it
in
a
taster
out
of
curiosity
and
wasnt
let
down
this
beer
is
very
good
i
picked
up
a
growler
along
with
a
growler
of
regular
coffee
o
good
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
good
finished
off
a
growler
tonight
clear
nice
color
good
hoppy
aroma
i
mostly
go
for
ipa
and
this
is
a
worthwhile
alternative
i
will
buy
again
awesome
rye
ipa
big
spice
flavors
with
citrusy

overall
a
tasty
rye
driven
ale
overall
for
those
that
enjoy
red
ales
the
rye
kicks
it
up
a
notch
and
creates
an
enjoyable
beer
an
interesting
red
rye
not
bad
reddishbrown
pour
with
a
lasting
white
head
that
left
some
spotty
lacing
on

and
piney

more

was

decent

medium

with

that
adds
another

with

by

easy
drinking
a

overall
a
pretty
tasty

beer
although
something
of
a
stylistic
hybrid
probably
the
weakest
offering
from
carton
that
ive
had
so
far
several
other
awesome
beers
in
their
limited
portfolio
though
i
could
drink
boat
or
monkey
chase
till
i
vomit
down
just
a
bump
in
the
road
o
overall
a
very
good
rye
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
founders
reds
rye
pa
though
i
like
that
one
a
bit
better
as
it
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
this
one
this
one
has
more
sweet
dark
fruits
which
is
a
nice
touch
though
would
certainly
have
it
again
hoped
with
piney
simcoe
cluster
and
horizon
hops
with
a
spicy
touch
of
rye
overall
a
very
nice
rye
ale
comparable
to
my
favorite
founders
red
rye
a
great
option
for
hop
heads

i
continue
to

im

out
of

i
should
have
expected
that
when
buying
a

with

i
will
be
cracking
a

of

with

with

i

this

this

managed
to
turn

more
than

was

i
really
like
this
beer
pours

with
a
minimal
head
and
sticky

lots
of
rye
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
whisky
too
a
bit
of
charred

and
raisins
dry
mouthfeel
from
the
rye
its
not
a
rye
bomb
and
its
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
but
its
complex
and
fun
to
drink
try
this
if
you
get
a
chance
im
in
nc
we
hit
against
the
grain
last
year
the
brewers
couldnt
have
been
cooler
theyre
doing
a
great
job
of
it
now
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
rye
beer
aged
in
rye
whiskey
barrels
really
hoping
for
a
big
sticky
rye
wine
here
but
it
just
doesnt
pan
out
this
is
a
slightly
yeasty
weird
maybe
bretty
pale
beer
with
minimal
rye
character
and
a
lot
of
talk
but
not
much
game
my
bottle
didnt
have
feathers
on
it
either
which
was
a
real
let
down
given
it
still
cost
basically
20
bucks
absolutely
not
worth
that
a
good
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
for
being
a
rye
barrel
aged
beer
its
pale
amber
not
well
carbonated
and
really
not
smelling
or
tasting
a
whole
lot
like
rye
or
much
of
anything
for
that
matter
certainly
no
off
flavors
or
anything
thats
an
obvious
flaw
it
just
seems
to
me
that
a
beer
with
this
description
ought
to
have
a
whole
lot
more
going
on
its
bland
and
i
have
to
search
for
the
rye
its
too
light
in
body
and
never
really
gets
going
for
me
not
bad
but
really
underwhelming
for
me
if
it
was
ten
bucks
i
would
be
less
pissed
against
the
grain
has
yet
to
really
impress
me
but
they
charge
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
their
stuff
i
dont
expect
it
to
stick
here
in
colorado
if
it
keeps
being
this
lame
o
very
enjoyable
rye
beer
very
smooth
great
flavor
mellow
and
drinkable
thanks

big
burst
of

tapers
off

almost
like
rye
after
sitting
in
a

of
melted

cubes
light
residual
hints
of

slight

medium
bodied
also
seems
to
start
with
a
mild
creaminess
but
finishes
unexpectedly
a
bit
light
in
mouth
feel
an
interesting
take
on
a
rye
barrelled
beer
the
initial
flavor
and
mouth
feel
are
quite
nice
and
promising
but
it
finishes
a
bit
thin
and
much
less
flavor
intensity
id
try
this
again
but
not
in
the
quite
pricey
750
ml
bomber
interesting
flavorful
but
unbalanced
taste
sequence
the
bottle
is
very
cool
but
leaves
feathers
everywhere
i
cant
imagine
unpacking
a
case
of
these
this
is
a
very
good
brew
in
every
way
unique
for
the
style
and
a
very
smart
use
of
the
rye
barrels
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
looking
for
something
new
and
interesting
against
the

chiquen

o
part
amber
ale
part
brown
ale
with
some
dark
fruit
spiciness
and
bourbon
presence
the
most
enjoyable
part
is
the
rye
spiciness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
the
flavors
are
a
subtle
blend
if
you
enjoy
brown
ales
this
may
be
a
good
match
and
worth
trying
if
you
expect
a
moderately
bold
flavorful
beer
its
not
thanks
to
howard
for
this
one
overall
interesting
and
fairly
good
but
most
of
all
an
awesome
bottle
i
appreciate
this
for
its
differences
from
the
norm
an
interesting
beers
for
those
that
would
like
an
aggressive
rye
whiskyed
beer
the
mouthfeel
on
this
was
very
thin
little
carbonation
and
a
deep
amberbrown
body
there
is
almost
no
nose
but
i
got
a
minty
sort
of
smell
with
a
hint
of
oak
the
taste
was
a
disappointment
there
is
no
flavor
on
the
front
end
or
midpalate
there
is
a
nice
rye
whisky
finish
on
the
very
back
end
the
thin
body
combined
with
oily
mouthfeel
and
lack
of
flavor
made
this
one
a
clear
miss
for
me
overall
high
hopes
for
a
beer
thats
feathered
didnt
live
up
to
the
presentation
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
rye
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
but
i
am
not
getting
any
real
barrel
presence
other
than
some
slight
woody
aspects
overall
a
great
rye
beer
probably
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
neat
stuff
rye
ale
aged
in
rye
barrels
has
characteristics
of
amber
ales
brown
ales
and
rye
ales
an
enjoyable
beer
but
a
bit
pricier
than
id
usually
pay
for
something
of
this
style
about
17
but
thats
just
due
to
my
personal
tastes
prefs
o
meh
another
average
beer
from
atg
was
really
hoping
for
bursting
bourbon
spice
and
more
vanilla
its
quite
hollow
i
supposed
i
was
spoiled
when
my
first
atg
beer
was
the
de
molen
created
bo
luke
too
many
avg
to
poor
beers
have
come
after
cool
bottle
but
dont
rush
out
and
buy
this
that
being
said
rye
flavor
is
very
nice
tho
no
booziness
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
must
be
in
that
chiquen
well
aged
beers
of
moderate
strength
and
body
are
a
rare
comodity
with
a
rare
step
outside
of
the
few
examples
of
gales
and
fullers
its
nice
to
see
these
flavors
being
revisited
by
inquisitive
brewpubs
o
this
is
probably
the
nicest
rye
beer
ive
tried
to
this
point
i
think
the
aging
in
barrels
that
previously
contained
straight
rye
whiskey
adds
extra
depth
and
additional
layers
of
flavor
to
this
beer
i
hope
they
bring
this
one
back
in
the
future
taste

and
spicy
bitey

resin
pine

a

great
for

posthike
cool
down
earthiness
spice
and
lighter
body
paris
great
with
indian
food
overall
a
drinkable
but
easily
forgettable
pale
whose
bitterness
borders
on
ipa
the
flavors
is
lacking
any
complexity
or
any
of
the
citrus
that
is
pleasurable
in
the
aroma
from
the
12
oz
can
purchased
at
wilburs
total
beverage
in
fort
collins
overall
a
very
enjoyable
rye
ipa
my
server
made
the
initial
pour
so
i
was
only
a
party
to
the
crack
glug
rathe
than
being
directly
involved
it
arrived
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
croesus
midas
and
mammon
were
all
back
in
my
kitchen
so
i
had
this
beer
all
to
myself
nose
was
both
hoppy
and
spicy
grapefruit
and
pepper
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
really
reminiscent
of
an
aipa
with
a
great
bitterness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
evinced
the
black
pepper
of
the
rye
giving
it
a
cool
almost
minty
finish
wow
the
finish
was
very
dry
and
since
i
still
had
a
half
of
a
can
left
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
to
really
release
the
esters
and
now
the
pepper
took
on
a
prevalence
not
initially
experienced
great
stuff
o
a
pleasant
rye
pale
ale
quite
heavy
on
the
hops
maybe
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
flavors
othis
is
my
first
beer
from
telluride
brewing
and
i
am
impressed
the
smell
in
particular
fits
my
idea
of
what
a
good
rye
pale
ale
should
smell
like
it
is
sharp
and
spicy
but
not
overthetop
bitter
or
astringent
the
taste
doesnt
quite
have
the
same
intensity
but
for
a
5
5
brew
this
packs
a
decent
bit
of
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
rye
pale
better
than
most
rye
hoppy
beers
ive
had
tons
of
bitterness
thats
slightly
harsh
i
dunno
if
they
date
their
cans
but
this
one
just
didnt
have
anything
going
for
it
aside
from
the
malt
ill
drink
a
stout
or
porter
if
i
want
something
this
malt
forward
i
could
tell
it
was
hopped
the
bitterness
was
apparent
but
the
flavor
was
just
muddled
and
didnt
go
anywhere
beyond
the
rye
and
the
barley
maltiness
o
awesome
beer
a
killer
rye
pale
that
has
enough
rye
to
be
obvious
and
enough
bitterness
to
be
a
pale
i
like
this
beer
because
ive
not
had
a
rye
beer
this
light
in
color
before
and
its
great
its
all
in
the
balance
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
patchy
haze
aromas
of
rye
malt
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
pretty
nice
so
far
more
rye
and
moderately
sweet
caramel
malt
along
with
some
grapefruit
and
resin
hops
very
drinkable
and
quenching
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
solid
carbonation
enjoyable
brew
very
drinkable
a
pretty
good
tasting
pale
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
i
hope
this
brew
makes
its
way
up
to
denver
telluride
is
a
hell
of
a
drive
recommended
awesome
after
hiking
o
interesting
combination
of
very
light
malt
rye
and
pinelike
hops
this
does
it
well
giving
it
a
feeling
that
i
would
be
happy
to
take
with
me
on
a
backpacking
trip
especially
in
these
nice
cans
very
well
balanced
rye
brew
pours
a
less
than
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
smells
a
bit
like
rye
malts
but
also
like
english
malts
and
a
fairly
aggressive
hopping
flavor
is
less
hoppy
than
a
standard
american
pale
but
everything
is
in
excellent
proportion
hop
profile
is
fruity
to
grassy
while
the
malt
is
like
a
dark
rye
bread
only
mildly
spicy
but
quite
bold
feel
is
good
too
very
refreshing
with
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
light
crisp
finish
first
beer
from
telluride
was
a
winner
overall
this
is
super
refreshing
washing
over
your
palate
as
it
has
the
nice
floral
citrus
notes
along
with
a
great
spicy
and
bitter
finish
without
a
lot
of
sweetness
or
alcohol
to
weigh
things
down
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
feel
its
a
perfect
bring
along
for
any
outdoor
adventures
in
colorado
or
elsewhere
looking
at
the
falls
on
the
can
makes
me
want
to
take
a
trip
out
to
telluride
to
see
it
myself
and
also
maybe
stop
in
at
the
brewery
for
a
pint
or
three
well
done
on
your
first
canned
brew
guys
cheers
long
live
night
shift
viva
habanera
rye
malt
and
habanero
pepper
flesh
along
with
a
nice
kick
to
the
back
of
the
throat
if
youre
not
used
to
spicy
food
avoid
this
it
is
quite
hot
for
the
average
person
warms
the
entire
chest
personally
i
love
it
this
pours
a
stunning
cinnamon
color
gorgeous
but
no
head
the
smell
is
slightly
vegetal
but
is
really
not
much
at
all
taste
is
essentially
missing
on
the
initial
taste
then
a
lingering
burn
in
you
throat
there
are
some
pepper
flavors
no
noticeable
hops
its
a
decent
beer
overall
but
i
came
away
think
they
could
have
done
much
more
with
it
with
more
initial
hop
or
malt
flavor
and
less
heat
o
just
not
for
me
but
this
is
a
well
constructed
and
brewed
beer
that
really
brings
the
heat
despite
my
below
ravg
rating
i
do
strongly
encourage
any
capsaicin
addicts
out
there
to
try
this
beer
prost
pours
a
dirty
brown
muddled
body
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
has
a
nice
spicy
pepper
to
it
flavor
though
is
a
let
down
mild
black
pepper
mixed
with
spicy
habanero
but
not
as
powerful
or
forceful
as
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
disappointing
brew
without
much
heat
and
complexity
overall
the
caramel
and
rye
base
of
this
beer
is
very
tasty
however
this
is
about
as
hot
a
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
the
taste
is
good
but
may
be
a
bit
much
for
some
people
and
is
fairly
one
note
after
the
initial
caramel
this
is
a
quality
beer
to
get
every
now
and
again
but
i
could
not
imagine
myself
drinking
a
full
bomber
by
myself
o
overall
this
is
just
okay
it
was
so
much
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
on
tap
it
was
potent
and
delicious
this
is
just
a
weary
version
batch
20
bottled

consumed
on

this
beer
is
awesome
cook
with
marinate
chicken
steak
vegetables
etc
and
interesting
to
drink
although
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
kill
a
whole
bottle
ill
definitely
be
doing
it
again
overall
i
personally
didnt
like
it
but
the
beer
delivers
exactly
what
it
promises
so
if
it
sounds
good
to
you
will
probably
like
it
well
the
beer
delivers
the
hot
pepper
decent
beer
to
go
with
it
but
nothing
too
special
or
crazy
nice
belgian
brown
feel
almost
with
good
fruit
and
some
habanero
flavor
i
thought
this
was
nicely
spiced
tangy
but
not
overdone
i
had
this
with
a
mexican
salad
beans
peppers
onions
etc
and
thought
it
complimented
the
entrée
well
o
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
anything
by
night
shift
after
hearing
so
much
about
them
i
thought
this
was
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
was
enjoyable
the
spicy
quality
to
it
was
great
when
i
first
started
drinking
this
beer
but
as
i
made
my
way
further
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
enjoyment
of
the
spice
kind
of
wore
off
it
was
a
really
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
people
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
pepper
beers
but
i
did
really
enjoy
this
one
5
610
poured
from
a
750ml
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
ruby
color
with
a
frothy
light
offwhite
head
that
starts
a
robust
two
inches
and
rapidly
settles
into
a
sparse
filmy
coating
smells
a
bit
like
a
big
quad
belgianlike
yeast
characteristics
both
fruity
and
floral
with
a
touch
of
pepper
at
the
end
flavors
of
mild
roasted
grain
but
only
for
a
split
second
because
thats
how
long
it
takes
for
the
sizzling
burn
to
set
in
on
your
tongue
and
mouth
very
subtle
to
start
but
this
fire
builds
very
good
as
it
doesnt
overpower
or
sacrifice
the
flavor
for
the
heat
the
more
you
drink
you
start
to
get
more
belgian
characteristics
with
a
bit
of
yeast
funk
again
as
well
as
some
farmhouse
spicing
the
rye
definitely
gives
a
nice
roasty
and
even
grain
backbone
and
that
pepper
just
keeps
on
coming
by
the
end
of
the
palate
the
pepper
adds
flavor
as
well
as
heat
spicy
hot
aftertaste
with
touches
of
the
grain
bill
once
again
clean
and
light
in
mouth
which
helps
keep
things
sharp
overall
smooth
clean
finish
interesting
brew
rusty

with
a

the

mellow
for

up

toasty
grains
green
pepper
followed
by
some
hot

prickle

making
for

pretty
smooth

overall
mediumbodied
and
quite
enjoyable
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
past
random
sunday
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
spice
pepper
chipotle
and
relish
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
relish
earth
pickle
pepper
and
salt
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
oh
great
another
pepper
spiced
beer
what
could
possibly
go
wrong
based
on
my
past
experiences
actually
this
one
actually
was
quite
good
and
well
balanced
the
pepper
aspect
was
definitely
there
but
it
did
not
destroy
your
palate
and
stomp
it
into
the
mud
there
was
quite
a
bit
else
going
on
that
helped
to
cut
the
heat
and
actually
balance
out
the
flavors
that
were
present
a
huge
surprise
since
i
have
always
hated
life
after
drinking
brews
like
this
in
the
past
definitely
worth
your
time
trying
this
one
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
would
i
buy
it
again
absolutely
o
i
was
wondering
how
the
peppers
would
come
into
play
here
and
i
feel
as
though
they
were
done
wonderfully
i
am
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
pepper
beers
this
is
well
rounded
with
a
nice
bit
of
heat
on
the
finish
good
show
pours
a
slightly
murky
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
leaving
moderate
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
spicy
rye
and
peppery
yeast
phenols
with
a
sweet
lightly
bready
and
caramel
malt
base
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
i
cant
find
any
peppers
in
the
nose
they
must
be
subtle
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
spice
and
rye
providing
balance
i
found
the
pepper
and
it
comes
in
lightly
in
the
middle
and
lingers
long
into
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spicy
mouthfeel
nice
brew
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
pepper
but
i
enjoyed
it
just
the
same
i
hate
small
pours
but
its
appropriate
in
this
case
the
heat
built
up
a
bit
by
the
time
i
was
done
o
a
very
unique
and
surprisingly
good
beer
its
not
very
traditional
but
it
has
good
strong
flavors
with
excellent
balance
its
not
too
spicy
too
hot
or
too
sweet
the
flavors
meld
surprisingly
well
its
hot
but
not
overly
so
its
a
borderline
chile
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
definitely
the
star
of
the
show
in
this
one
surprisingly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
style
too
overall
recent
batches
have
dialed
up
the
habanero
and
it
works
balanced
and
approachable
for
a
chile
beer
brownamber
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
served
in
a
flute
glass
completely
translucent
with
no
sediment
or
cloudiness
the
heat
of
the
habanero
pepper
is
immediate
and
dominating
with
regards
to
the
smell
and
taste
moreso
for
the
taste
there
is
also
a
very
nice
balance
of
malthops
since
i
was
able
to
decipher
both
over
something
as
bold
as
a
pepper
the
pepper
flavor
itself
was
very
recognizable
and
tasty
many
pepper
beers
are
a
mess
but
this
did
a
great
job
of
portraying
the
pepper
used
this
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
obviously
leaves
some
heat
in
the
aftertaste
as
intended
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
because
its
delicious
and
delivers
as
promised
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
tastes
more
like
a
bitter
shock
top
an
easydrinking
balanced
refreshing
pale
ale
with
a
subtle
hint
of
rye
pretty
great
warm
weather
beer
light
and
refreshing
beer
advocate
gives
a
harsh
grade
on
this
one
not
overly
complex
but
i
dont
the
sense
that
was
the
goal
it
screams
spring
sticky
the
relative
thinness
of
taste
might
fool
you
into
thinking
this
is
a
session
ale
yeast
the
aftertaste
is
good
so
i
enjoyed
the
beer
overall

huge

cloudy
orange
liquid
not
a
big
smell
but
it
had
orange
and
pine
the
taste
had
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
citrus
and
little
bitterness
to
it
very
spritzy
all
in
all
i
could
drink
it
all
the
time
just
because
its
refreshing
this
was
very
strong
in
the
citrus
department
for
a
rye
beer
spiciness
provided
balance
and
made
this
quite
drinkable
pours
from
the
growler
in
to
an
ipa
glass
with
a
light
golden
hue
and
just
a
kiss
of
red
rye
the
minimal
white
head
settles
quickly
in
to
a
thin
collar
while
the
transparent
liquid
shows
just
a
touch
of
chilled
haze
the
aroma
yields
bready
pale
malts
and
hops
of
the
earthy
variety
only
moderately
aromatic
with
just
traces
of
rye
discernible
the
taste
follows
the
nose
mildly
flavored
and
balanced
with
a
slightly
drying
finish
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
from
the
rye
and
a
lingering
mild
hop
bitterness
leave
a
lasting
impression
a
spritzy
lively
carbonation
helps
give
the
impression
of
a
fuller
body
though
its
mostly
an
illusion
and
a
good
one
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
affair
and
it
makes
me
yearn
for
something
more
potent
and
flavorful
like
a
ruthless
rye
when
a
pale
ale
takes
on
the
same
basic
profile
of
an
ipa
but
tames
all
of
the
desirable
characteristics
down
it
simply
leaves
me
unsatisfied
its
not
easy
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
and
not
bold
enough
to
stand
out
perhaps
a
good
bridge
to
better
things
if
youre
trying
to
ease
in
to
the
craft
world
the
color
of
this
beer
is
insane
the
smell
is
also
great
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
especially
exciting
though
overall
this
is
much
better
than
i
anticipated
light
and
citrusy
but
just
enough
earthy
rye
spiciness
to
balance
things
out
serving
type
bottle
eric
golden
with
moderate
head
that
dissapates
slowly
into
a
lacy
white

subtle
nose
with
notes
of
grass
and
slight
fruitiness
medium
bodied
with
nice
complexity
starts
off
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
and
transitions
to
bready
then
earthy
almost
woody
hop
notes
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
yum
overall
bells
has
once
again
formulated
a
very
nice
brew
i
recommend
everyone
give
it
a
try
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
rye
and
hops
fairly
typical
of
an
american
ale
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
but
not
quite
as
sweet
refreshing
serving
type
bottle
nothing
stands
out
about
this
beer
but
it
is
a
superbly
balanced
beautifully
crafted
ale
dont
expect
fireworks
here
just
relax
and
enjoy
this
one
being
glad
were
living
at
a
time
when
such
good
fresh
beer
is
so
readily
available
im
smitten
gets
mixed
reviews
but
one
of
my
favorites
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
at
least
that
was
my
experience
very
thin
and
watery
the
idea
is
there
but
not
so
great
execution
super
refreshing
beer
citrus
and
hop
flavors
smooth
easy
drinking
cuts
through
the
indra
kanindra
i
just
had
onot
my
favorite
beer
but
very
drinkable
the
bottle
is
dated
010415
and
was
decanted
to
a
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
small
head
a
small
amount
of
head
lasts
throughout
with
quite
a
lot
of
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
subtle
with
a
nice
malt
and
piney
smell
the
taste
is
nicely
crisp
and
refreshing
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
overwhelming
and
the
aftertaste
is
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
lingering
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
the
presence
of
rye
is
not
obvious
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
great
hopheavy
rye
its
bitter
but
goes
down
easily
all
around
a
great
brew
smell
and
taste
are
totally
flowery
and
perfumey
but
i
just
love
it
it
is
making
me
type
a
review
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
by
far
better
than
some
of
the
beers
i
had
in
the
flight
at
the
ecentric
cafe
overall
a
very
nice
hopforward
englishstyle
rye
pale
ale
extremely
drinkable
despite
the
bitterness
as
usual
a
nice
offering
from
bells
and
a
welcome
addition
to
their
early
winter
seasonal
rotation
o
reasonably
unique
pale
ale
with
a
nice
rye
spice
to
it
and
plenty
of
citrus
and
floral
bite
its
kind
of
like
what
i
would
expect
a
rye
english
bitter
to
taste
like
its
pretty
solid
nothing
special
but
worth
a
shot
beautiful
color
crisp
to
the
point
of
almost
a
bitter
finish
very
refreshing
another
quality
effort
from
bells
i
may
be
alone
here
but
i
love
this
beer
slight
hazy
hay
creamy
slightly
dry
bright
palate
cleanser
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
little
head
and
lacing
very
smooth
the
right
mixture
of
citrus
and
hops
i
believe
this
beer
would
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
american
ipas
to
a
newer
drinker
overall
a
great
experience
cloudy
light
copper
rye
notes
are
present
in
the
nose
but
i
am
not
really
getting
any
rye
in
the
flavor
profile
the
body
is
light
with
a
crisp
and
mildly
bitter
finish
some
lighter
malts
on
the
nose
spice
light
fruit
almost
grape
light
some
alcohol
warming
medium
to
a
little
more
on
the
carbonation
brilliant
straw
color
not
bad
had
this
on
one
of
the
last
few
warm
days
of
summer
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
clean
golden
ale
with
a
nice
spice
from
the
rye
usually
i
prefer
rye
in
a
pale
or
ipa
but
this
worked
nice
yellowish
color
completely
clear
with
a
little
head
not
bad
a
very
nice
pale
ale
very
easy
to
quaff
to
excess
a
very
pleasing
appearance
light
aroma
and
flavor
and
enjoyable
palate
nice
balance
of
citrus
floral
hop
strength
and
rye
crusty
cracked
grain
o
i
really
like
this
beer
for
what
it
isa
slightly
bitter
and
citrusy
rye
forward
beer
this
hits
it
out
of
the
park
so
refreshing
and
drinkable
pours
golden
amber
hue
with
foamy
carbonating
white
head
aroma
is
tart
and
bitter
hoppy
and
floral
with
some
mild
pine
notes
in
the
background
flavor
is
pleasant
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
satisfying
hop
flavor
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
mouth
another
success
from
bells
amber
yellow
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
dense
white
foam
with
excellent
staying
power
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
citrus
hop
and
floral
aromas
up
front
with
rye
malt
notes
in
tow
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
resinous
feel
flavors
are
similar
to
aromas
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
up
front
followed
by
spicy
rye
malt
through
the
middle
and
a
clean
light
crisp
finish
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
fine
light
summery
ale
featuring
a
delicate
lemony
tartness
the
rye
component
definitely
adds
a
oneofakind
of
subdued
spiciness
to
things
nice
and
delightful
overall
a
very
solid
rye
pale
ale
with
clean
flavors
but
maybe
light
on
the
rye
to
bring
out
its
true
qualities
a
very
mellow
enjoyable
beer
o
like
a
less
bright
deeper
and
more
maltoriented
version
of
the
two
hearted
which
is
also
very
good
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lagunitas
mason
jar
good
head
retention
finger
and
a
half
head
darker
golden
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
mild
smell
some
hops
and
malt
nothing
overwhelming
tastes
good
to
me
malty
and
bitter
but
sweet
as
well
some
caramel
notes
for
sure
and
definitely
a
little
bite
on
the
back
end
some
hints
of
rye
in
there
but
not
a
ton
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
overall
a
nice
beer
probably
would
have
been
better
if
it
was
fresh
or
on
draft
but
i
got
this
with
a
case
being
clearanced
at
20
per
so
i
cannot
complain
will
definitely
try
to
get
it
on
draft
for
comparison
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
much
like
bells
twohearted
ale
has
a
strong
hop
taste
and
aroma
balanced
out
by
the
caramel
undertones
there
are
overtones
of
rustic
dry
malt
which
balance
out
the
caramel
and
hops
as
well
not
a
very
large
head
if
poured
and
very
carbonated
great
on
its
own
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
two
hearted
ale
by
bells
it
has
a
very
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
good
clarity
with
a
light
caramel
color
and
thirst
quenching
with
a
six
percent
abv
this
beer
finishes
very
smooth
the
carbonation
finished
very
creamy
great
very
similar
to
bells
famous
2
hearted
ale
lighter
in
color
a
golden
yellow
and
not
as
strong
in
terms
of
hops
or
bitterness
refreshing
flavor
is
perfect
for
the
summer
month
there
is
a
distinct
carbonation
that
leaves
a
tingling
aftertaste
hoppy
and
refreshingly
light
beer
light
carbonation
aids
in
the
hoppy
flavor
developing
doesnt
leave
an
after
taste
like
other
beers
with
this
much
hoppy
flavor
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
light
foods
and
great
for
summer
time
drinking
a
great
rye
flavored
beer
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
you
are
invited
in
by
the
caramel
color
and
once
you
smell
this
beer
you
are
hooked
you
can
smell
the
hops
right
from
the
beginning
once
this
beer
touches
your
lips
you
can
taste
the
hops
and
citrus
flavor
of
this
great
beer
o
another
good
beer
from
bells
this
beer
seems
like
a
great
session
beer
although
i
say
that
without
having
checked
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
little
texture
light
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
spicy
finish
thats
on
the
dry
side
with
rye
and
hops
nice
beer
overall
pale
ale
or
rye
beer
category
is
not
important
since
its
tasty
crisp
and
easy
drinking
could
be
a
session
beer
if
i
can
get
more
of
it
o
i
bought
this
single
bottle
at
price
chopper
and
im
guessing
it
hasnt
been
properly
handled
id
like
to
get
a
fresh
clean
bottle
i
suspect
id
give
it
a
better
review
o
very
nice
and
worth
the
quaff
dare
i
say
it
it
is
what
i
would
seek
if
i
pictured
a
rye
hopslam
pure
white
foam
head
tightly
woven
microfoam
semiaggressive
pour
yields
a
little
over
a

is
okay
the

are
meager
but
long
average
stick
filmy
golden
colored
liquid
lots
of
fine
particulate
floating
throughout
semiopaque
as
a
result
few
visible
bubbles
very
grainy

featuring
spicy
rye
notes
black
pepper
orange
and
grapefruit
rinds
once
you
get
past
the
initial
burst
theres
underlying
sweetness
found
in
honey
notes
and
peach
apricot
fruit
accents
light
touch
of
mineral
water
and
cigar
ash
before
it
floats
off
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
charges
right
out
of
the
gate
gets
things
churning
on
the
dry
side
even
as
the
rye
is
not
over
the
top
hoppy
with
no
lack
of
leafiness
even
if
its
the
grains
which
take
precedence
stronger
citrus
presence
here
lemon
to
orange
as
in
the
nose
the
apricot
peach
yellow
apple
fruit
holds
off
before
showing
the
finish
is
filled
with
earthy
metallic
notes
creates
added
bitterness
that
said
balanced
on
the
whole
drinking
well
chilled
helps
you
can
tell
it
is
well
crafted
however
it
also
has
a
sort
of
lowbrow
throwback
feel
and
taste
to
it
m
full
bodied
and
refreshing
for
a
6
abv
very
easily
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
even
my
wife
likes
it
who
usually
prefers
very
easygoing
wheat
beers
ive
had
many
a
good
beer
from
bells
and
this
is
one
of
them
definitely
a
good
session
beer
on
a
warm
spring
day
o
this
beer
goes
down
so
easy
it
keeps
you
refreshed
especially
if
it
were
a
hot
day
i
can
imagine
a
cold
one
of
these
going
down
great
probably
good
with
bbq
and
lounging
on
the
porch
my
only
drawback
is
that
it
dries
out
the
palate
a
bit
much
i
like
what
bells
is
going
for
here
with
this
beer
and
i
think
it
could
be
sessionable
at
6
give
it
a
try
a
fairly
nice
brew
perhaps
more
of
an
american
pale
as
referenced
above
with
hints
of
rye
as
it
lacks
the
robust
rye
backbone
some
of
its
counterparts
in
the
style
possess
not
my
favorite
beer
not
terrible
but
the
flavors
mix
in
weird
ways
that
dont
really
work
for
me
heres
an
interesting
alternative
to
the
number
of
standard
pale
ales
on
the
market
i
like
smitten
poured
in
to
a
pint
glass
hazy
dark
yellow
thin
white
head
smells
bready
with
floral
notes
taste
light
and
sweet
up
front
dry
rye
and
floral
hops
on
the
finish
much
to
commend
but
nothing
particularly
remarkable
solid
session
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
this
pours
a
copper
gold
with
incredible
head
retention
i
caught
just
a
touch
of
peppery
rye
backing
the
lemony
hop
aroma
along
with
a
lightly
buttered
body
thats
smooth
and
crisp
theres
a
touch
of
lemon
and
crack
of
peppercorn
i
enjoyed
this
but
id
like
it
more
if
it
was
a
sessionable
4
abv
instead
of
its
6
recommendation
plenty
of
value
for
this
beer
ideally
i
would
drink
this
on
my
patio
on
a
hot
day
but
this
has
enough
dimension
to
sip
and
ponder
light
and
does
not
linger
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
easy
to
sip
on
i
think
this
is
a
good
addition
to
bells
rotation
but
is
not
something
that
i
would
pick
over
the
oberon
a
good
mix
and
balance
of
sweet
faint
caramel
toasty
and
fruity
spice
and
orange
hop
bitterness
pretty
solid
enjoyable
beer
even
for
me
who
is
pretty
picky
about
rye
beers
o
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
proper
price
6
abv
a
nice
try
for
a
beer
drinker
who
likes
darker
versions
of
beers
that
arent
too
heavy
like
ales
lagers
and
pilsners
super
easy
drinking
beer
cant
believe
how
good
it
is
a
real
sleeper
in
their
catalog
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
tons
of
this
now
that
bells
is
in
town
overall
an
interesting
twist
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
profile
here
particularly
in
the
metallic
edge
this
is
a
strong
beer
for
only
6
percent
and
the
flavors
are
bold
and
uncompromising
rye
here
matched
perfectly
with
its
hops
pleasant
and
tasty
o
a
decent
quaff
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
bread
i
find
it
overpowering
so
i
welcome
the
muted
rye
notes
which
have
many
of
the
virtues
of
the
bread
without
bowling
me
over
i
liked
this
beers
balance
and
id
drink
it
again
great
drinkability
but
that
may
just
be
my
taste
overall
im
a
huge
rye
fan
so
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
solid
balance
and
easy
drinking
i
really
like
bells
in
general
i
have
had
a
few
rye
beers
and
none
of
them
have
done
it
for
me
i
thought
if
any
brewery
could
do
it
bells
could
maybe
my
taste
buds
were
off
tonight
but
this
is
an
odd
beer
it
smells
great
similar
to
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
it
looks
great
and
in
the
beginning
it
tastes
good
then
that
spicy
bitterness
hits
and
it
lingers
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
in
a
bad
way
its
a
very
strong
bitterness
that
i
could
not
shake
i
thought
maybe
it
was
me
i
drank
some
water
ate
a
few
pretzels
then
tried
again
same
result
it
tastes
very
nice
on
the
front
of
my
tongue
but
as
it
passes
over
the
rest
of
my
mouth
it
clings
in
a
rather
unpleasant
way
to
the
back
it
gives
off
a
strange
alkaline
flavor
that
i
just
cannot
get
past
i
will
have
to
say
this
is
not
my
favorite
by
bells
i
will
place
it
in
the
same
category
as
oberon
another
grain
that
i
dont
enjoy
in
my
beers
wheat
oddly
enough
the
other
rye
beers
i
had
tried
in
the
past
did
remind
me
of
wheat
beers
and
is
why
i
did
not
enjoy
them
but
now
i
have
found
another
reason
not
to
like
them
i
am
giving
this
one
higher
marks
than
i
should
and
on
paper
it
looks
better
than
it
is
but
the
smell
is
nice
i
will
have
to
give
bells
that
anyway
i
will
keep
trying
on
occasion
but
this
one
does
fall
short
i
do
find
this
odd
because
i
generally
like
rye
whisky
and
i
also
like
wheated
bourbons
but
as
far
as
beers
go
neither
wheat
nor
rye
work
for
i
saw
this
today
at
meijer
and
decided
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
sure
am
glad
i
did
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
about
1
inch
of
head
that
faded
but
left
nice
lacing
has
nice
hop
aroma
and
flavor
but
you
can
also
detect
some
spiciness
from
the
rye
i
really
like
this
well
donebells
o
being
a
lover
of
bells
i
had
to
try
this
when
i
found
it
at
a
local
grocery
store
not
as
good
as
their
staples
but
not
a
bad
beer
a
decent
refreshing
albeit
dry
mediumbodied
beer
really
great
overall
i
could
drink
this
every
day
super
great
hop
flavors
and
really
well
balanced
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
slight
carbonated
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
rye
and
grain
scents
the
taste
is
full
of
rye
and
has
a
dry
finish
there
are
lots
of
earthy
tones
that
make
this
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
interesting
and
very
well
made
o
great
bier
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
as
a
fan
of
bells
and
of
rye
beers
i
felt
inclined
to
try
this
offering
though
it
was
met
with
mixed
reviews
i
am
very
glad
i
tried
this
offering
this
ale
pours
a
hazy
beautiful
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
pour
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
lacing
for
such
a
light
bodied
ale
the
nose
is
very
subtle
with
fresh
flavors
of
rye
and
a
little
yeast
almost
smells
more
european
than
american
in
nature
the
flavor
is
light
and
subtle
as
well
slightly
bitter
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
with
definite
notes
of
yeast
and
rye
it
is
very
light
and
easy
sipping
by
far
not
my
favorite
offering
from
bells
or
my
favorite
rye
ale
but
none
the
less
a
very
enjoyable
ale
that
could
be
sessioned
all
day
or
just
enjoyed
as
a
refreshing
quaff
after
work
hazy
golden
body
with
a
soft
white
head
the
aroma
brings
grain
mild
hops
earth
citrus
the
flavor
is
ok
a
bit
too
conservative
for
me
a
hint
of
hops
mild
bitterness
finishing
dry
crackers
grain
earth
middle
of
the
road
not
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
bells
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
nor
everyday
drinker
of
pale
ales
as
it
stands
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
worth
a
try
this
bells
offering
misses
the
mark
i
will
never
begrudge
a
hoppy
beer
with
an
edge
however
smitten
has
too
much
resiny
bitterness
and
not
enough
malt
to
back
it
up
and
whatever
the
rye
was
supposed
to
do
it
decided
it
had
other
places
to
be
besides
a
quick
earthy
taste
i
do
not
think
the
rye
has
contributed
much
really
this
beer
is
just
far
too
bitter
with
nothing
to
accentuate
the
brute
force
o
great
beer
here
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hoppy
rye
beers
this
is
one
to
pick
up
easy
drinking
some
rye
beers
get
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
all
the
acidity
can
make
them
difficult
to
consume
for
a
session
beer
this
has
great
balance
wish
it
was
available
year
round
it
would
make
a
great
springsummer
beer
my
2nd
beer
from
bells
and
my
2nd
let
down
the
label
to
me
explains
how
it
tastes
as
a
kid
we
would
dare
each
other
to
break
the
stem
of
a
dandelion
and
lick
the
white
stuff
this
beer
taste
like
that
very
bitter
and
immediately
after
sipping
i
feel
my
sinuses
clear
the
after
taste
taste
like
a
generic
beer
to
me
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
the
beer
is
labeled
as
a
golden
rye
ale
but
the
short
description
states
that
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
based
on
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
id
concur
that
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
american
pale
ale
and
that
the
rye
while
part
of
the
ingredient
list
is
part
of
the
flavoring
rather
than
the
primary
grain
the
6
00
abv
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
bells
smitten
golden
rye
ale

overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
flavor
coupled
with
its
ease
of
drinkability
the
rye
really
flourishes
with
warmth
adding
to
the
depth
of
the
grain
bill
while
lightening
up
any
inherent
bitterness
of
hops
that
may
have
escaped
the
final
blend
this
is
nice
as
it
adds
a
robustness
to
the
main
bulk
of
both
the
nose
and
the
tongue
this
does
however
seem
like
more
of
a
commercial
pull
with
enough
lightness
to
appeal
to
the
masses
that
said
we
ended
up
very
much
appreciating
that
aspect
of
it
as
it
made
it
wonderfully
drinkable
especially
when
coupled
with
the
soft
and
creamy
drag
to
each
sip
although
well
known
within
the
stage
this
is
one
of
bells
sleepers
and
definitely
something
we
feel
would
appeal
to
many
beer
appreciators

pours
bright
yellowish
orange
with
a
white
one
finger
head
lots
of
sediment
in
here
so
pour
foul
on
my
part
i
guess
aroma
is
orange
citrus
spicy
rye
and
a
bit
if
wheaty
yeast
funk
light
orange
rind
flavor
finishes
with
some
hint
of
rye
spice
seems
very
much
a
summer
ale
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
neat
twist
on
the
rye
beer
style
almost
a
combo
of
oberon
and
ruthless
rye
medium
bodied
with
the
effervescence
sharp
at
first
before
mellowing
drying
throughout
but
slightly
warming
as
well
easy
to
drink
it
fits
more
between
a
pale
and
an
ipa
than
i
thought
at
first
good
stuff
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
pours
a
hazy
deep
yellow
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
floral
and
a
dry
to
apple
like
rye
note
in
the
taste
dry
green
apple
to
tartness
with
some
floral
notes
a
small
bite
and
alighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
dry
green
apple
rye
presence
and
floral
notes
in
the
aftertaste
nice
presence
of
rye
and
floral
presence
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
brew
that
i
thoroughly
enjoy
each
time
i
have
it
this
is
bottle
4
and
just
as
pleasing
as
the
first
rounds
i
had
after
work
i
will
definitely
be
sure
to
grab
this
next
winter
when
it
comes
out
again
recommended
overall
like
having
some
sourdough
rye
toast
with
grapefruit
marmelade
in
a
glass
very
enjoyable
and
a
unique
change
up
from
a
lot
of
other
summer
type
beers
would
be
great
around
a
campfire
at
night
perhaps
an
odd
combination
of
flavors
for
some
but
ill
be
buying
again
i
allowed
the
beer
to
flow
freely
from
the
bottle
until
the
foaming
head
threatened
to
pass
over
the
lip
of
the
glass
i
easily
had
two
fingers
of
french
vanillacolored
head
with
not
only
great
retention
but
as
it
fell
it
was
creating
great
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
like
freshly
squeezed
grapefruit
juice
the
nose
was
to
die
for
it
had
the
black
pepper
of
the
rye
along
with
a
very
earthy
scent
like
digging
in
the
garden
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
black
pepper
flavor
was
immediately
evident
on
the
tongue
it
combined
nicely
with
the
grapefruit
flavor
of
the
hops
this
is
an
apa
wow
the
finish
was
dry
especially
with
that
lingering
flavor
of
freshlyturned
soil
i
would
have
this
again
real
soon
hopefully
to
share
with
the
old
lady
bells
did
a
pretty
nice
job
with
this
one
smitten
yeahkinda
its
good
the
rye
presence
is
probably
a
tad
strong
a
slightly
stronger
hop
presence
with
less
rye
would
be
spoton
this
is
good
stuff
though
worth
picking
up
high
c
borderline
b
pours
a
warm
goldenbrown
color
with
a
puff
of
white
foam
over
top
which
clings
nicely
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
to
mind
buttery
bread
crust
faint
floral
notes
and
a
trace
of
rye
whiskey
theres
a
strong
taste
of
piny
hop
varieties
accompanied
by
rye
bread
its
got
a
medium
mouth
feel
and
quite
the
bitter
finish
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
a
very
solid
rye
beer
all
things
considered
d
this
was
not
a
great
rye
beer
the
scent
was
subpar
and
the
taste
and
body
werent
a
big
improvement
the
finish
wasnt
bad
but
wasnt
great
no
real
impressive
or
redeeming
element
not
recommended
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
nice
summertine
refreshing
brew
with
lots
of
enjoyable
hop
aspects
i
could
see
where
someone
who
doesnt
dig
pale
ales
or
ipas
might
be
turned
off
by
this
as
it
has
quite
a
hop
punch
to
it
thanks
again
jason
overall
meh
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
brew
doesnt
really
come
together
for
me
and
its
neither
light
nor
dry
enough
for
what
i
want
it
to
be
spicy
bold
ale
no
light
crisp
ale
not
really
too
middleoftheroad
i
suppose
and
the
rye
characteristics
are
overshadowed
by
the
yeast
and
what
i
interpret
to
be
the
liquorwater
characteristics
i
probably
wouldnt
avoid
it
but
id
likely
not
order
it
for
myself
either
overall
a
light
rye
beer
is
a
cool
idea
put
not
great
in
practice
it
is
good
though
soild
offering
from
bells
also
great
on
tap
great
rye
brew
love
the
fresh
citrus
flavor
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
nicely
balanced
and
light
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
different
much
lighter
take
on
what
can
be
done
with
rye
not
great
but
enjoyable
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
really
had
all
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
a
pale
ale
plus
the
addition
of
rye
to
make
it
a
rye
beer
theres
nothing
particularly
groundbreaking
here
but
its
definitely
tasty
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
smitten
pours
a
golden
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
similar
to
a
bathroom
luckily
its
not
too
strong
the
taste
is
crisp
a
nice
strong
citrus
and
a
nice
bit
of
bitterness
nice
full
flavor
overall
a
not
bad
beer
good
citrus
flavors
that
work
well
in
this
beer
o
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
porch
beer
the
hop
and
malt
profile
are
clean
and
simple
yet
play
well
together
a
seasonal
ale
that
doesnt
break
the
bank
overall
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
pale
rye
ale
flavorwise
reminds
me
a
bit
of
deschutes
red
chair
solid
allaround
balance
with
an
interesting
mix
of
flavor
bring
this
to
california
please
heres
the
typically
terse
but
clever
label
verbiage
from
the
bottle
with
wonderfully
bitter
citus
notes
resinous
hop
flavors
and
earthy
overtones
this
interesting
take
on
the
american
pale
ale
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
room
to
wonder
if
youll
love
it
well
done
but
id
skip
the
superlatives
wonderful
and
interesting
should
be
left
to
the
consumer
to
decide
true
enough
its
a
very
likable
brew
to
me
this
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
im
not
totally
sure
why
its
bottled
in
january
its
very
drinkable
and
price
point
is
right
on
track
with
most
craft
sold
today
my
only
real
gripe
is
if
its
a
rye
ale
i
think
it
should
use
a
much
heavier
rye
recipe
overall
a
nice
little
beer
for
a
hot
summerspring
day
o
a
decent
experiment
the
hops
and
the
rye
clash
a
bit
but
not
to
a
degree
to
make
it
unpleasant
the
6
0
abv
is
a
nice
little
kick
and
is
well
hidden
served
from
bottle
to
glass
had
a
thick
head
that
was
about
2
fingers
thick
rich
yellow
color
with
some
sedimentation
floating
in
the
glass
had
a
great
smell
of
citrus
first
sip
hits
you
with
bitter
citrus
notes
and
slight
hit
of
hops
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
good
summer
ale
overall
a
solid
beer
but
i
seem
to
have
a
favor
for
lighter
rye
beers
i
love
the
way
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
comes
through
when
paired
with
lighter
flavorsmell
profiles
i
would
easily
find
myself
buying
a
sixer
of
this
brew
listening
to
dr
john
on
spotify
goes
great
with
this
light
summerspring
brew
from
bells
color
is
a
kiss
of
orangeapricot

a

fine
even

hitting
with

underlying
hints
of

glowing
through
like
your

the

hits
with

heavy
on
the
peel
glazed
with
sweetness
from
the

and
balanced
with
the
rye
sharpness
flavor
is
melding
well
heavy
bitterness
with
minimal
crashing
waves
of
alcohol
seeping
through
this
beer
is
sending
out
a
lovely
message
refreshment
with
hop
bitterness
someone
had
to
do
it
im
glad
its
a
great
company
like
bells
im
going
to
quit
trying
to
act
like
somebody
else
and
just
enjoy
whats
good
and
not
whats
popular
i
dont
see
this
beer
getting
raved
about
let
me
start
the
bandwagon
its
fuckin
good
simply
pleasurable
well
crafted
american
pale
ale
the
more
i
taste
and
smell
this
beer
im
getting
limoncello
with
spiced
rye
grains
bleeding
through
the
alcohol
not
nearly
as
strong
but
the
same
presence
mouthfeel
is
creamy
textured
with
hints
of
nuttiness
on
the
sides
of
my
palate
ample
flowing
carbonation
this
beer
is
smooth
but
still
has
that
lingering
rough
hop
oil
bitterness
that
most
normal
beer
drinkers
dont
care
for
however
im
a
hophead
and
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
overall
high
quality
well
thought
out
beer
that
im
pleasured
to
sample
a
bottle
of
keep
em
coming
good
stuff
from
our
friends
up
in
michigan
a
nice
beer
here
for
sure
admittedly
ryes
are
not
my
favorite
of
styles
but
this
one
was
refreshing
and
tasty
eh
i
wasnt
very
impressed
at
all
it
seems
like
a
user
friendly
beer
for
people
just
switching
over
to
craft
o
i
saw
this
six
pack
when
i
visited
bells
two
weeks
ago
and
i
just
had
to
try
it
nothing
crazy
very
simple
rye
beer
solid
drinking
beer
kinda
surprised
this
come
out
in
the
winter
maybe
its
an
all
year
beer
as
today
it
tastes
like
the
hope
for
spring
that
i
need
o
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
spring
beer
that
is
enjoyable
on
a
warm
afternoon
not
sure
i
would
grab
this
one
again
as
there
are
other
rye
beers
that
i
prefer
which
are
easily
to
come
by
and
bells
is
not
readily
available
where
i
live
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
citrus
taste
is
hoppy
spicy
rye
some
malts
a
mild
bitterness
well
balanced
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
love
rye
beers
and
the
bells
smitten
is
no
different
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
this
white
head
that
left
a
very
nice
lace
down
the
pint
glass
the
scent
carried
a
rye
flare
with
subtle
lemony
citrus
notes
the
taste
was
a
very
crisp
common
rye
taste
with
light
sitrus
backing
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
session
beer
and
i
will
be
looking
to
drink
more
of
it
good
beer
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
white
head
on
a
hazy
gold
body
moderate
head
retention
suddsy
lacing
aroma
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
citrusy
lemony
hops
and
a
light
sweetness
taste
is
nicely
bittered
refreshingly
fresh
tasting
with
a
mild
background
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
think
over
and
over
d
im
a
big
fan
of
both
bells
brewery
and
rye
beersbut
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
the
rye
component
isnt
nearly
present
enough
in
any
facet
and
there
isnt
too
much
else
here
to
get
excited
about
this
is
something
that
ill
avoid
in
the
future
o
pretty
good
rye
beer
the
spicy
rye
is
done
just
right
and
the
assertive
hop
profile
really
balances
this
beer
out
very
drinkable
o
the
great
hop
flavor
and
nice
rye
support
is
full
and
tasty
but
it
is
dry
enough
and
light
enough
in
the
body
that
it
is
very
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
o
this
is
nice
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
rye
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
bells
regular
pale
ale
its
a
better
pa
than
a
rye
beer
but
its
a
nice
beer
regardless
o
light
crisp
and
refreshing
rye
kicks
in
at
the
finish
o
an
enjoyable
golden
ale
for
sure
will
seek
it
out
again
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
im
surprised
to
not
see
it
rated
higher
i
have
drank
allot
if
the
top
beers
heady
pliny
zombie
to
name
a
few
and
loved
all
of
them
and
think
this
should
be
ranked
up
there
with
the
rest
must
be
my
love
of
rye
beers
they
are
definitely
under
rated
overall
smitten
is
an
excellent
surprise
i
found
it
delicious
and
enjoyable
and
will
certainly
seek
it
out
again
cheers
o
pretty
decent
but
nothing
to
scream
about
a
good
beer
though
a
golden
body
with
great
head
and
lace
on
top
of
a
piney
hop
aroma
with
a
good
amount
of
rye
that
is
picked
up
that
bready
smell
it
can
sometimes
give
off
smooth
almost
creamy
easy
to
drink
not
bland
or
boring
but
not
the
most
exciting
beer
a
floral
hoppy
taste
along
with
citric
is
balanced
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
the
rye
smoothes
things
out
while
giving
it
a
tad
spiciness
and
crispness
in
the
finish
cant
complain
with
relaxing
with
this
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
take
on
an
american
pale
ale
it
has
the
hops
and
spiciness
of
an
apa
and
the
graininess
drinkability
and
refreshing
qualities
of
a
wheat
beer
it
would
make
a
terrific
summer
beer
oan
easy
drinking
spring
beer
however
adding
more
rye
or
hops
would
give
the
beer
slightly
more
flavor
which
it
needs
o
this
is
a
great
beer
offers
a
smooth
transition
from
winter
to
spring
i
dont
know
if
this
is
seasonal
or
what
but
i
like
this
baby
a
nice
smooth
sipper
with
great
flavors
there
is
a
lot
of
stuff
in
the
bottle
but
with
semicareful
decanting
pours
mostly
clear
amber
well
carbonated
and
pours
with
a
foamy
head
this
is
pretty
hoppy
and
the
rye
seems
to
add
some
spiciness
still
the
hoppiness
does
not
seem
to
be
as
over
the
top
as
in
all
day
ipa
but
i
sense
a
head
to
head
tasting
coming
up
the
carbonation
and
hoppiness
combine
for
a
solid
mouthfeel
overall
this
goes
down
very
easily
perhaps
sessionable
by
taste
despite
abv
6
dont
get
caught
up
in
the
style
just
drink
it
a
very
nice
beer
will
take
this
over
oberon
as
a
better
spring
offering
from
bells
o
generally
wouldnt
be
my
type
of
beer
considering
its
hopheaviness
but
bells
does
it
well
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
this
beer
had
good
balance
and
the
spicy
rye
flavors
went
nicely
with
the
floral
hop
profile
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
but
it
was
a
little
filling
so
i
think
two
would
be
enough
for
me
but
i
might
be
inclined
to
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
warm
spring
day
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
good
and
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
decent
but
it
was
a
little
to
thick
and
too
filling
for
my
liking
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
it
gets
warmer
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
nice
and
refreshing
warm
weather
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
like
rye
beers
all
in
all
i
was
satisfied
with
this
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
more
fitting
if
they
released
this
beer
in
the
late
spring
early
summer
it
just
seems
like
this
beer
would
be
good
for
that
time
of
the
year
this
is
a
nice
rye
beer
but
i
think
i
would
rather
have
a
founders
reds
rye
or
any
of
the
shorts
rye
beers
instead
but
this
one
wasnt
bad
by
any
means
this
was
another
solid
offering
from
bells
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
poured
this
rye
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
orangegolden
color
produced
an
average
white
head
nice
retention
and
left
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
contained
spicy
rye
caramel
and
floral
hops
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
sweet
caramel
spicy
rye
and
citric
hops
overall
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
very
easy
to
drink
average
to
above
average
example
of
the
style
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
for
a
rye
beer
but
its
a
nice
earthy
presentation
overall
inky
and
earthen
tones
are
there
on
the
end
fairly
full
carbonation
a
hearty
drinker
even
though
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
most
rye
beers
you
get
out
there
full
bodied
and
much
more
interesting
than
expected
the
nose
is
pretty
boring
but
its
actually
complex
well
balanced
and
flavorful
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
up
front
gives
off
some
dry
bitterness
with
resinous
oils
grass
and
pine
needle
flavor
some
peppery
rye
but
like
the
nose
its
not
a
dominant
flavor
nicely
balanced
by
yeast
light
fruit
notes
and
a
pale
malt
backbone
hints
of
bread
biscuit
and
cracker
round
things
out
in
the
dry
finish
not
a
great
beer
but
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
nice
hop
flavor
pours
a
golden
body
with
lots
of
yeast
suspended
and
swirling
around
with
a
small
white
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
of
honey
and
grain
with
slight
hints
of
flowers
and
pineapple
taste
is
consistent
with
the
aromas
and
extremely
well
balanced
in
the
malt
to
hop
ratio
and
finishes
dry
with
a
flavor
of
orange
pith
its
worth
trying
if
you
dont
mind
chewing
yeast
smitten
golden
rye
ale
is
pretty
bold
less
citrus
than
an
ipa
with
a
more
bitter
finish
it
smells
hoppy
and
crisp
the
look
of
this
beer
is
cloudy
and
golden
with
small
chunks
suspended
like
fruit
in
jello
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
full
flavored
id
drink
it
again
tastefeel
great
stuff
ive
only
had
about
three
or
four
rye
beers
in
my
life
and
this
one
tastes
different
than
most
but
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
something
im
not
used
to
because
ryes
generally
seem
more
bitter
to
me
the
floral
notes
with
the
sweetness
and
really
light
rye
makes
this
a
super
tasty
beer
the
rye
doesnt
come
out
very
strong
but
a
good
beers
a
good
beer
the
taset
is
pleasant
with
citrus
peel
hop
flavor
and
gentle
earthy
malt
with
slight
grassy
taste
from
the
hops
w
light
tannic
element
which
seems
like
a
tealike
hop
astringency
with
toasted
maltiness
in
the
back
end
overall
a
pretty
tasty
rye
w
nice
balance
and
plenty
of
hop
flavor
which
is
almost
a
rye
ipa
in
terms
of
perceived
bitterness
with
fresh
taste
and
dry
feel
that
brings
you
back
for
more
this
beer
is
immaculate
superbly
crafted
amazing
balance
straightforward
and
clean
with
a
nice
complexity
this
beer
is
about
everything
i
could
want
from
an
american
pale
ale
my
favorite
beer
this
year
so
far

out

aroma

nice

ryeforward
with
light
malts
and
hopping
the
taste
again
is
rye
forward
but
it
doesnt
smack
you
upside
the
head
with
spiciness
the
rye
is
also
brilliantly
matched
by
an
apalevel
of
bright
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
bells
smitten
is
an
excellent
rye
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
it

an
insanely
delicious
level
of

me
coming
back

more

lift

it

were
just
mild
with
a
sharp
note
of
rye
over
top
of
light
citric

pretty
light
flavors
have
some
decent
citric
hops
and
sharp
rye
notes
but
they
end
ebruptly
and
nothing
really
lingers
there
is
some
earthiness
that
comes
into
play
but
the
flavors
seem
to
die
out
pretty
quickly
after
a
good
start
not
one
of
the
better
rye
ales
i
have
had
but
its
not
horrible
by
any
means
o
in
the
end
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
how
often
i
will
buy
it
i
think
i
would
always
prefer
two
hearted
over
this
especially
since
this
is

if
this
was
a
4
5
5
beer
this
would
end
up
in
the
fridge
more
often
like
it
dont
love
it
but
worth
trying
o
not
bad
but
im
certainly
not
smitten
with
it

bready

by

character
and
a
bit
of

mild
bitterness
with
notes

grapefruit
medium

with
a
chalky
finish
overall
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
a
little
disappointed
this
ale
could
use
some
cleaning
up
i
like
this
beer
the
rye
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
over
powering
which
is
good
because
im
really
not
that
big
into
rye
beers
plenty
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
rye
ale
thus
far
you
can
actually
taste
and
enjoy
the
addition
of
rye
in
this
one
quite
quenching
and
sessionable
this
would
also
make
a
great
ale
for
summer

o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
there
was
a
lot
less
rye
flavor
than
i
initially
thought
that
there
would
be
however
the
amount
present
turned
out
to
be
perfect
i
can
not
emphasize
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
i
drank
my
first
bottle
waaay
to
fast
and
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
rye
a
very
nice
spring
offering
o
nice
beer
would
be
better
in
hotter
months
overall
a
pretty
solid
rye
beer
good
spice
and
citrus
taste
this
beer
pleases
me
a
lot
in
part
because
there
are
too
few
beers
with
this
sort
of
bitterness
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
not
a
vocabulary
in
english
to
distinguish
differing
qualities
of
bitter
perhaps
its
the
rye
i
am
into
otherwise
id
love
to
know
which
bittering
hops
were
included
the
substantial
body
for
a
pale
ale
seems
to
help
keep
that
flavor
lingering
long
enough
that
i
can
really
relax
into
it
in
contrast
some
very
tastey
beers
have
fleeting
flavors
that
i
would
rather
hold
onto
longer
perhaps
ill
have
some
criticism
after
a
few
more
but
the
first
two
just
taste
balanced
and
delicious
o
this
was
really
tasty
i
wished
that
i
had
another
one
as
soon
as
i
finished
the
first
overall
i
found
it
to
be
tiresome
and
tedious
frankly

it

i
would
drink
it
again
a

this

februarys
as
good

time
as
any

if

for

it
might
become
a

something
relatively

it

the

here
is
a

to

the

in

overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
the
best
of
the
fest
abr
overall
definitely
a
delicious
and
underrrated
beer
a
great
showcase
of
what
brett
can
do
and
the
rye
adds
a
nice
complexity
o
from
the
nose
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
great
beer
but
the
flavor
and
astringency
lead
to
this
being
only
solid
it
is
nice
to
see
bells
experimenting
with
brett
i
love
the
pun
on
thisits
a
play
on
the
kalhaven
trail
that
runs
across
southwest
michigan
the
beer
is
a
light
tan
amber
with
light
foam
i
get
a
earthy
funk
from
the
aroma
its
light
but
present
like
a
light
onion
sliced
in
the
adjoining
room
which
is
the
only
way
i
could
think
of
describing
it
nice
malt
body
with
a
delicate
brett
note
that
emerges
as
it
warms
not
bad
but
id
like
to
see
what
could
happen
with
some
more
time
on
this
one
it
shows
promise
and
plenty
of
potential
overall
a
bells
tap
only
that
is
easy
to
miss
but
great
if
you
find
it
great
balance
between
tropical
juicy
fruit
and
earthy
funky
yeast
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
i
have
had
certainly
a
different
and
creative
beer
here
not
quite
a
sour
not
quite
a
rye
beer
what
the
hell
is
it
who
knows
and
who
cares
as
long
as
it
tastes
good
right
well
its
pretty
good
the
tartness
gets
weaker
as
the
beer
goes
on
and
the
funky
rye
flavors
get
more
powerful
still
not
sure
if
i
like
that
or
not
id
like
to
try
this
beer
again
a
few
months
from
now
probably
wont
be
able
to
find
it
though
pours
a
mix
of
light
bronze
and
hazy
amber
with
bits
of
dark
yellow
the
head
was
an
inch
of
loose
off
white
suds
that
look
die
off
into
nothing
small
spots
of
lace
smells
like
a
lot
of
great
bretted
up
homebrew
ive
had
brett
and
some
funk
and
a
lot
of
barnyard
imo
some
rye
is
under
all
the
wild
some
caramel
and
grain
the
taste
is
pretty
marvelous
bretty
up
front
with
hay
and
grass
and
other
earth
barnyard
not
overly
funky
kinda
tart
i
like
the
low
level
of
rye
in
this
some
rye
bread
and
grain
towards
the
end
feel
is
below
medium
with
a
nice
carb
punch
from
the
tap
crisp
and
evervesant
easy
going
down
if
bretts
your
thing
its
mine
so
this
is
insanely
drinkable
good
job
pours
a
dusty
copper
color
with
orange
highlights
decent
cap
of
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
scent
is
mellow
funk
earth
clay
with
dry
spicey
grain
taste
is
a
little
more
aggressive
spicy
rye
with
a
mild
funkyness
to
it
medium
bodied
active
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
a
decent
beer
which
combines
ingredients
from
different
styles
nicely
chewy
medium
body
that
is
slightly
spicy
with
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
rye
along
with
a
slightly
puckering
dry
bretty
efervescence
the
tart
brett
presence
is
mos
prominent
up
frogt
and
slowly
fades
throught
the
palate
as
the
malts
and
rye
counter
it
very
well
balanced
and
quaffable
with
a
sweet
dry
finish
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
between
the
two
bells
sour
beers
i
have
had
this
and
wild
one
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
the
rye
gives
it
a
very
nice
balance
and
makes
it
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
very
good
beer
love
to
see
this
one
again
and
to
repeat
bells
start
spreading
these
wilds
around
you
seem
to
have
a
knack
for
it
i
was
hoping
to
retaste
it
the
next
day
but
it
was
not
poured
at
the
beer
fest
to
my
knowledge
it
was
enjoyable
sharing
my
appreciation
of
this
rye
with
the
owner
and
his
brewers
d
my
first
visit
to
bells
so
i
was
hesitant
to
get
more
than
one
glass
at
a
time
that
being
said
this
one
is
interesting
especially
whem
the
rye
makes
itself
known
poured
a
copper
body
with
solid
head
and
lace
ring
down
glass
aroma
is
citric
floral
hops
and
a
hearty
malt
base
some
of
it
being
the
rye
i
think
this
is
a
really
smooth
ipa
with
the
rye
helping
smooth
things
out
and
having
a
noticeable
presence
beer
is
balanced
as
it
has
citric
hop
dryness
and
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
not
the
most
flavorful
rye
beer
but
the
sour
and
dry
grainy
aspects
are
minimal
and
thats
how
i
prefer
a
rye
beer
i
had
this
in
draft
not
can
so
apparently
i
missed
out
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
crisp
the
slight
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
simcoe
hops
and
rye
are
nice
balanced
mix
on
the
tongue
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
this
beer
holds
up
nicely
over
the
24
ounces
i
would
drink
this
one
again
o
3

drinkable
enough
but
not

once

and
earth

finishes
with
an

pours
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
ample
head
and
tremendous
lacing
clinging
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
dank
hoppy
piney
with
some
grapefruit
and
assorted
citrus
taste
is
very
hoppy
with
plenty
of
piney
hops
and
grapefruit
carbonation
is
a
touch
lighter
than
i
would
have
wanted
but
overall
this
beer
feels
good
and
the
7

is
hidden
very
well
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
almost
no

when
poured
from
a

with
a
hint
of
simcoe
smooth
with
a
nice
spicy

finish
not
a
whole

very
drinkable

not

it
out

would

nice
sorry
kids
but
there
was
no
way
that
i
was
going
to
perform
an
inverted
glug
with
a
24oz
can
following
the
crack
i
went
with
a
heavyhanded
pour
instead
and
still
got
twoplus
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
moderate
retention
the
head
fell
as
i
was
typing
and
cuing
up
some
accompanying
music
but
loads
of
lacing
remained
in
its
wake
color
was

copper
srm
9
before
this
i
dont
think
that
i
ever
had
an
official
beer
of
a
band
check
that
off
the
list
wow
surprisingly
good
well
balanced
with
a
nice
piney
finish
to
be
blunt
its
a
standard
smaller
brewery
ipa
to
be
fair
its
a
decent
representation
this
beer
fits
what
i
think
is
the
new
normal
for
a
decent
no
bones
enjoyable
localsmall
brewery
ipa
its
not
special
but
its
not
to
be
avoided
either
overall
a
nicely
done
rye
ipa
a
bit
too
much
rye
to
be
refreshing
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
give
a
slight
balance
to
the
rye
overall
this
beer
was
not
very
good
and
quite
a
let
down
shame
too
the
more
random
trillium
beers
i
have
the
more
im
starting
to
think
they
are
overrated
unfortunately
i
really
doubt
i
will
finish
this
entire
750ml
as
its
not
really
enjoyable
more
of
a
chore
to
drink
o
very
interesting
and
bold
rye
beer
sharp
flavors
this
is
very
fresh
after
all
with
a
bold
rye
that
you
rarely
find
very
spicy
and
herbal
unique
and
tasty
ruddy
brown
medium
bodied
rye
flavor
is
not
so
complex
but
the
rye
is
nice
and
up
at
the
forefront
not
bad
just
ok
nice
mellow
sweet
tone
rye
definitely
steps
in
to
give
a
very
good
spiced
tone
to
it
that
is
well
balanced
very
smooth
feel
a
very
easy
drinker
a
very
nice
beer
at
first
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
as
time
went
on
it
got
much
better
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
better
on
bottle
than
draft
glad
to
get
to
try
something
from
trillium
very
much
looking
forward
to
the
next
overall
an
ok
to
above
average
rye
beer
the
rye
is
dominate
and
it
mixes
well
with
the
other
flavors
a
solid
beer
it
just
felt
like
something
was
missing
i
may
have
appreciated
this
more
if
if
it
came
in
a
smaller
size
but
a
bomber
just
seemed
a
bit
much
worth
a
try
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
this
is
an
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
on
the
bready
side
with
long
lasting
lingering
flavors
o
a
very
interesting
beer
enjoyable
foodfriendly
paired
well
with
neapolitanstyle
pizza
that
said
i
get
more
rye
beer
out
of
this
one
than
i
do
farmhouse
ale
as
there
is
much
more
rye
character
than
there
is
yeast
character
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
owell
done
not
many
similar
beers
that
i
have
come
across
i
am
always
down
to
try
another
one
of
trilliums
individual
concoctions
far
from
my
favorite
but
i
respect
the
effort
overall
4
255
wakerobin
is
a
really
interesting
spin
on
the
farmhousesaison
ale
style
everything
seems
to
work
in
perfect
balance
the
marriage
of
saison
yeast
and
rye
malt
provides
a
great
foundation
the
moderately
bitter
piney
hops
work
well
as
a
complimentary
flavor
and
the
turbinado
sugar
helps
bring
out
some
subtle
dark
fruit
flavors
and
help
boost
the
mouthfeels
creaminess
a
really
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
dry
start
but
malty
it
quickly
develops
a
bit
of
black
pepper
the
finish
unusual
but
attractive
its
nearly
astringent
and
dies
out
quickly
but
retains
a
lot
of
the
spice
moderate
body
with
an
elevated
carbonation
level
o
enjoyable
farmhouse
ale
good
layering
of
flavors
and
sturdy
body
not
the
most
memorable
but
certainly
a
solid
effort
nice
job
trillium
the
beer
pours
a
lasting
and
creamy
off
white
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
hints
of
brown
the
beer
smell
has
strong
rye
notes
with
earthy
and
floral
hops
the
smell
has
notes
of
apple
and
cinnamon
other
notes
exist
such
as
spices
and
herbs
the
beer
taste
is
less
complex
the
rye
and
the
hops
are
the
dominant
notes
that
come
out
the
other
notes
such
as
apple
and
herbs
and
spices
are
present
but
not
as
noticeable
the
texture
is
medium
bodied
with
biting
carbonation
and
drinks
smoothly
a
pretty
decent
rye
beer
o
frozen
glass
aside
i
dont
really
think
there
is
much
here
to
get
me
to
try
this
again
im
glad
i
had
it
and
given
a
few
of
its
qualities
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
trilliums
stuff
however
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
poured
into
a
can
glass
pours
orange
red
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
citrus
and
grassy
hops
tastes
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
little
rye
taste
as
well
beer
is
light
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
and
nice
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
the
rye
does
well
but
the
malt
backbone
is
a
bit
to
much
caramel
and
i
feel
like
it
takes
away
from
the
hop
taste
profile
in
the
beer
sampled
at
snallygaster
2014
freaking
great
ipa
with
just
the
right
amount
of
rye
overall
very
nice
but
just
a
little
bit
too
sweet
on
my
end
but
very
well
made
beer
i
know
that
i
constantly
contradict
myself
but
i
am
much
more
of
a
fan
of
aipas
than
apas
generally
but
second
only
to
hops
is
rye
imho
i
really
dig
what
rye
does
for
beer
and
rye
whiskey
is
my
achilles
heel
i
considered
biting
off
the
cap
just
to
expedite
matters
but
then
i
sobered
up
however
briefly
i
began
with
a
very
heavyhanded
pour
resulting
in
over
three
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
following
a
pseudocascade
color
was
a
copperyamber
srm
9
13
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
of
peppermint
black
pepper
and
caramel
i
was
ready
to
swoon
the
peppermint
and
some
of
the
black
pepper
were
directly
attributable
to
the
use
of
rye
while
the
sweetness
was
from
the
malt
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
the
taste
was
minty
peppery
slightly
sweet
but
not
by
much
the
finish
was
breathtakingly
dry
with
the
cool
mintiness
simply
lingering
following
the
swallow
this
was
a
perfect
example
of
why
i
love
rye
in
my
beer
overall
an
easy
drinker
with
good
flavor
but
not
particularly
distinctive
the
taste
is
both
fruity
yeast
with
moderately
bitter
hop
flavor
almost
grassy
taste
with
light
astringency
from
a
citrus
dominant
hop
profile
the
taste
of
rye
is
pleasant
but
supports
the
hops
mostly
with
a
light
sweetness
in
the
taste
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
slightly
in
the
taste
but
only
as
it
increases
in
temperature
with
a
mild
tangerine
taste
of
the
hops
combined
with
yeast
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
filled
th
glass
with
foam
so
i
had
to
back
off
as
i
poured
but
intense
with
hops
and
a
little
warm
for
the
strength
i
consider
this
a
decent
rye
beer
as
it
is
pretty
quaffable
and
straddles
the
line
of
rye
pale
and
ipa
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
oa
nice
rye
ale
good
flavors
and
easy
drinking
mouth
feel
is
somewhat
light
overall
and
very
good
and
well
balanced
worth
checking
out
for
sure
overall
this
was
a
hell
of
a
nice
surprise
its
like
they
took
a
really
solid
rye
pa
like
well
founders
red
rye
pa
and
combined
with
21st
amendments
watermelon
beer
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
sixers
of
this
stuff
all
year
round
served
in
16oz
nonic
pint
at
meridian
pint
in
washington
dc
o
i
think
i
will
be
drinking
this
as
a
sessionable
drink
for
this
summer
i
havent
had
anything
like
it
but
it
is
different
in
a
good
way
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
monocacy
decides
to
bottle
in
the
future
overall
a
very
good
beer
at
a
very
good
price
definitely
grab
one
of
these
if
you
see
it
on
tap
in
the
mddc
area
o
a
very
flavorful
rye
ale
from
new
upstart
brewer
well
done
the
nose
is
loaded
with
hops
a
delicious
blend
of
citrus
and
pine
with
a
certain
melon
character
as
well
the
rye
spiciness
lends
a
certain
depth
and
backbone
that
most
hoppy
beers
lack
mildly
peachy
mild
nectarine
character
mild
crenshaw
melon
and
mildly
pine
like
in
great
balance
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
citrus
and
pine
mandarins
mint
pine
and
a
little
stone
fruit
this
is
followed
by
a
rye
dominated
mid
palate
where
theres
both
flavor
and
texture
fullish
despite
being
drying
this
aspect
really
enhances
the
hop
profile
especially
the
oiliness
and
resiny
character
carbonation
is
soft
as
well
enhancing
the
feel
and
texture
a
long
mildly
bitter
drying
finish
with
an
excellent
blend
of
flavors
pine
citrus
and
rye
in
great
balance
makes
for
an
excellent
beer
among
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
a
tasty
rye
beer
a
friend
recommended
it
so
i
gave
it
a
try
id
recommend
it
to
another
to
try
ive
had
issues
with
mts
amber
ales
so
maybe
my
taste
in
red
beer
just
varies
from
what
they
make
this
is
another
excellent
brew
from
modern
times
while
i
especially
like
their
variations
on
the
saison
style
this
one
proves
that
rye
is
the
grain
that
every
brewery
should
try
in
one
of
their
recipes
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
brewery
behind
the
strip
club
yep
this
beer
is
a
bit
above
aite
serving
type
bottle
looking
forward
to
trying
this
on
tap
someday
taster
at
uncle
bucks
in
grapevine
tx
on
draft
at
flips
burger
in
grapevine
fairly
decent
beer
all
bitter
dull
hops
on
the
taste
more
dank
sock
taste
than
good
dank
ipa
taste
grapevine
cb
makes
some
really
good
beers
but
the
lakefire
rye
is
mainly
all
i
see
at
the
stores
in
north
texas
bought
this
hoping
for
something
similar
to
the
summit
rye
the
majority
of
the
six
pack
i
purchased
has
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
taking
up
space
since
i
bought
it
i
will
never
buy
it
again
even
if
its
the
only
craft
on
tap
at
a
holeinthewall
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
find
runofthemill
bud
light
or
coors
more
drinkable
and
thats
saying
something
regretting
the
6pac
i
purchased
i
tried
this
along
with
stone
ipa
and
widmer
upheaval
ipa
and
it
had
a
better
body
and
hop
character
than
the
stone
surprisingly
more
floral
than
citrusy
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
side
info
poured
from
can
bought
in
irving
tx
served
around
45f
oeasy
drinking
but
flavor
is
lacking
i
had
a
couple
and
would
definitely
have
more
again
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
muddier
version
of
shiner
ryes
and
shine
some
sort
of
light
rye
amber
perhaps
nothing
too
offensive
stands
out
but
its
the
worst
microbrew
rye
beer
i
think
ive
ever
had
at
9six
pack
this
is
defintely
one
to
avoid
now
i
just
need
to
figure
out
how
to
get
rid
of
the
other
5
o
not
my
favorite
pa
but
as
at
as
flagship
beers
go
this
wasnt
too
bad
worth
a
beer
or
raster
but
personally
wouldnt
have
6
overall
i
was
wanting
to
try
this
brew
but
unfortunately
the
guy
i
got
it
from
missed
the
bottling
date
this
thing
is
way
past
its
prime
hes
a
good
guy
though
so
i
cant
give
him
too
much
grief
shows
potential
of
what
could
have
been
but
unfortunately
its
just
too
far
gone
a
certain
candidate
for
rereview
but
i
doubt
that
will
be
anytime
soon
pull
your
outdated
brews
off
the
shelves
damn
it
cheers
high
d
o
a
good
rye
ipa
cheers
overall
this
was
an
okay
beer
the
bottles
says
rye
lends
spiciness
to
the
caramelmalt
base
i
would
have
liked
to
feel
more
spiciness
from
this
beer
as
it
was
minimal
also
i
wish
they
brought
out
the
caramel
malt
flavors
more
i
still
dont
think
it
would
make
this
beer
awesome
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
they
did
those
things
also
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
used
piney
hops
i
would
use
other
kinds
of
hops
that
are
less
piney
for
this
beer
again
i
have
been
disappointed
by
yet
another
hatter
beer
i
love
new
holland
but
dont
think
ive
ever
really
liked
any
of
their
hatters
overall
a
decent
rye
pale
pours
a
beuatiful
caramelamber
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
shows
a
nice
will
to
live
the
aroma
shows
off
the
strong
malt
basis
with
just
hints
of
floral
hops
the
taste
has
the
same
profile
as
the
aroma
with
just
a
small
spiced
note
nice
fullness
on
the
palate
a
very
god
pale
ale
with
a
small
but
wellexecuted
twist
evenly
balanced
beer
between
the
malts
grains
and
hops
regarding
taste
spicy
tart
and
dry
with
a
robust
dark
malt
suggestion
perhaps
the
munich
malt
used
in
the
grain
bill
a
nice
find
along
the
colorado
front
range
and
another
reason
to
keep
looking
for
some
of
those
great
michigan
beers
tasty
beer
the
rye
is
very
much
present
and
pleasant
the
caramel
taste
goes
well
with
the
rye
i
would
pick
this
up
again
overall
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
beer
it
honestly
doesnt
seem
a
whole
lot
different
from
the
standard
mad
hatter
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
amber
to
a
rich
brass
hue
with
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
on
top
brussels
lacing
the
aroma
is
an
interesting
melange
of
spicy
ryepiny
hops
and
light
malt
the
taste
is
rye
and
light
malt
in
the
forefront
the
piny
hops
kick
in
and
the
back
of
the
palate
and
then
it
is
rye
and
light
malt
in
the
finish
the
mouth
is
slightly
sticky
and
the
hops
and
rye
gently
tickle
the
tastebuds
not
my
favorite
rye
ipabut
still
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
rye
beers
this
is
one
you
absolutely
must
try
i
had
this
on
tap
last
year
and
loved
it
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
again
this
rye
ale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
red
hue
with
a
billowing
and
long
lasting
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
bitter
notes
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
are
accented
by
peppery
and
herbacious
aromas
there
is
also
a
nice
underlying
malt
sweetness
that
balances
the
entire
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
full
bodied
side
of
medium
smoith
but
coating
the
flavor
is
more
bitter
than
the
nose
but
still
all
the
perceived
aromas
are
present
on
the
tongue
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
citrus
is
present
but
its
definitely
there
along
with
the
spice
floral
and
some
pine
this
is
good
real
good
and
quite
complex
there
is
almost
a
belgiany
quality
to
it
with
all
the
spiciness
and
yet
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
well
done
new
holland
aside
from
the
imperial
hatter
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
hatter
series
overall
a
decent
ipa
with
a
reasonable
pricepoint
will
buy
again
o
not
bad
at
all
i
really
like
the
way
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
separate
on
the
entry
and
then
integrate
on
the
finish
it
really
shows
the
drinker
how
a
beer
like
this
is
put
together
as
rye
ipas
go
this
one
is
not
really
groundbreaking
or
extreme
in
any
way
but
it
is
very
solidly
crafted
very
approachable
and
very
flavorful
i
like
it
o
this
is
one
of
the
the
best
rye
ipas
ive
had
when
its
fresh
every
aspect
being
graded
is
flirting
with
perfection
as
it
ages
the
citrus
fades
and
the
rye
becomes
more
prominent
but
its
still
enjoyable
the
lower
abv
makes
it
dangerously
sessionable
as
well
deep
cloudy
orange
with
a
clingy
white
head
reeks
of
dank
citrus
hops
and
rye
spice
tastes
like
it
smells
the
sweet
malt
and
citrus
battle
it
out
with
the
rye
spice
and
sharp
bitterness
a
very
raw
in
your
face
beer
yet
balanced
too
very
well
done
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
good
and
has
descent
flavor
the
medium
body
sports
a
steady
and
firm
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
good
crisp
and
creamy
movement
on
the
tongue
as
the
dryness
kicks
in
it
takes
a
little
out
of
the
body
but
not
too
much
4

overall
not
unique
and
not

all
around
nice

of

flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
where
many
of
the
hatters
are
husky
rustic
raw
and
somewhat
lacking
refinement
the
rye
character
here
continues
the
roughandtumble
attitude
and
actually
reinforces
it
with
stern
quality
overall
pretty
decent
well
balanced
i
really
liked
this
rye
ipa
from
the
folks
at
new
holland
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
overall
i
find
myself
wondering
if
ive
let
this
get
too
old
and
its
lost
some
of
the
flavor
7
months
old
kept
in
a
refrigerator
for
a
few
months
and
the
rest
in
winebeverage
cooler
at
45
degrees
either
way
id
prefer
reds
rye
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
wouldnt
be
offended
if
someone
served
this
to
me
at
their
house
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
o
the
flavors
are
spot
on
i
would
like
a
bit
more
rye
on
the
nose
but
still
a
strong
effort
a
good
beer
thats
an
overflowing
punch
of
flavor
that
im
enjoying
for
tonight
but
i
probably
wont
pick
up
another
bottle
of
it
3
5
d
quality
beer
with
no
real
faults
but
not
really
that
impressive
i
think
more
rye
would
have
given
this
more
of
an
edge
over
a
standard
ipa
pale
ale
like
in
aroma
taste
and
feel
medium
body
crisp
and
clean
pours
amber
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
caramel
bread
and
yeast
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bite
yet
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
a
little
bit
of
pepper
and
a
bitter
finish
nice
one
o
not
as
good
as
the
farmhouse
hatter
but
still
alright
with
all
these
variations
id
be
happy
to
try
the
standard
hatter
theres
nothing
like
an
original
pours
a
darker
amber
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
light
carbonation
hoppy
smell
with
light
citrus
hints
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
flavor
is
a
nice
hoppy
goodness
and
not
at
all
overpowering
i
find
many
ryes
too
strong
but
this
is
quite
delicious
and
drinkable
a
very
nice
rye
p
a
and
one
id
drink
again
but
unlike
the
poet
just
like
mad
hatter
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again

overall
a
very
fantastic
rye
ale
that
i
will
seek
out
again
o
really
nice
use
of
rye
which
can
overwhelm
a
beer
sometimes
this
is
a
more
subtle
application
of
the
ingredient
than
ive
tasted
generally
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
ipa
i
couldnt
find
a
freshness
date
anywhere
on
this
bottle
im
forced
to
conclude
that
it
was
a
little
long
in
the
tooth
as
it
was
extremely
underwhelming
and
didnt
live
up
to
the
high
ratings
that
it
receives
same
story
with
the
apa
id
like
to
give
them
another
try
found
some
of
this
on
a
trip
home
excellent
beer
er
ale
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
rye
ale
and
i
like
it
rye
can
be
quite
a
big
flavor
and
some
rye
beers
attempt
to
combat
this
with
bigger
malt
profiles
here
the
rye
is
very
subtle
and
the
malt
profile
is
actually
pretty
average
balanced
with
some
nice
hoppiness
stoneface
apparently
really
knows
what
they
are
doing
the
rye
begins
the
tasting
experience
and
then
there
is
a
boastful
earthy
and
pine
bitter
bite
lingering
at
the
end
this
is
another
great
one
from
stoneface
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
if
want
something
unique
excellent
rye
ale
with
the
right
blend
of
hops
rye
light
citrus
very
smooth
and
tasty
o
a
wellbalanced
rye
ale
which
is
sometimes
a
difficult
style
to
do
well
they
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
i
recommend
you
try
it
had
some
light
sweetness
leading
off
with
some
caramel
present
as
well
the
hopping
was
solid
with
some
rindy
resiny
notes
hitting
the
palate
ever
present
was
the
rye
action
lending
a
noticeable
spicy
quality
to
the
proceedings
which
lingered
nicely
a
solid
offering
prosit

o
yet
another
great
brew
by

perfect
red
for
the

season
oi
would
say
that
this
is
my
close
second
place
offering
from
stoneface
with
the
ipa
being
first
this
beer
is
awesome
and
i
hope
they
bottle
it
so
i
can
enjoy
at
home
like
i
do
the
ipa
keep
going

really
are

really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
ended
up
having
2
when
that
was
not
the
plan
looking
forward
to
stopping
by
next
weekend
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
this
is
another
great
brew
from
stoneface
and
their
lineup
so
far
has
been
stellar
i
slightly
prefer
their
bigger
ipa
but
this
is
an
awesome
rye
beer
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
else
these
guys
brew
o
recommended
if
you
want
a
rye
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
strong
hop
character
to
it
this
beer
really
focuses
on
the
rye
and
other
malts
that
said
i
enjoyed
it
overall
this
is
a
smooth
rye
style
beer
accentuating
a
malty
body
instead
of
more
hoppy
flavor
like
many
rye
brews
seem
to
focus
on
while
a
tiny
bit
more
hop
and
a
bit
more
rye
flavor
would
have
enhanced
the
flavors
a
bit
overall
it
was
rather
enjoyable
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
dry
bitter
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
lingering
afterbite
this
is
definetly
not
my
favorit
sam
adams
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
its
another
pleasant
brew
from
boston
beer
company
i
know
most
people
in
the
craft
beer
community
seem
to
knock
sam
adams
but
i
end
up
having
some
type
of
sam
adams
in
my
beer
fridge
yearround
regardless
of
the
stigma
that
has
slowly
evolved
i
have
found
most
sam
adams
offerings
to
be
extremely
drinkable
and
still
maintain
the
general
characteristics
of
whatever
style
they
were
shooting
for
this
was
an
ok
beer
i
will
certainly
pick
it
up
again
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
regular
lineup
got
their
triple
bock
and
excited
to
open
that
o
not
my
favorite
rye
beer
but
not
one
i
would
turn
down
either
nice
and
dry
with
a
nice
balance
of
rye
malt
and
hops
poured
a
walnut
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
bready
aroma
with
scents
of
caramel
and
light
spice
toasty
malts
in
the
taste
bready
light
sensation
of
dried
fruits
and
a
touch
of
spice
bitter
hops
follow
for
a
fairly
dry
finish
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
although
its
pretty
subtle
which
makes
it
an
easy
drinking
an
accessible
beer
i
kinda
like
this
beer
it
is
a
good
transitionary
winter
to
spring
beer
as
the
lable
boasts
i
like
the
redamber
start
followed
by
a
subtle
very
subtle
piney
finish
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
quite
nice
nice
amberred
color
with
foamy
white
head
nice
carbonation
as
well
i
did
not
smell
to
much
so
rated
it
low
in
that
category
the
taste
is
what
was
described
above
andit
is
very
easy
on
the
pallete
another
strong
beer
from
sammy
a
do
this
pale
ale
is
not
the
most
representative
of
ryeinclusive
beers
but
it
drinks
easily
enough
it
has
some
appealing
herbaceous
qualities
but
one
has
to
wonder
if
those
were
the
features
really
intended
to
stand
out
in
the
end
it
is
unremarkable
but
inoffensive
o
tasty
and
somewhat
smooth
a
good
sam
adams
beer
and
a
good
rye
ale
a
nice
summer
beer
the
nose
features
rye
and
sweet
malt
in
roughly
equal
strength
toasty
too
pleasant
but
mild
surprising
amount
of
bitterness
given
the
relative
lack
of
hop
flavor
the
rye
kind
of
fills
in
the
gaps
here
moderately
sweet
malts
bitterness
rye
and
thats
about
it
not
too
interesting
overall
this
strikes
me
as
the
boston
lager
with
a
touch
of
rye
i
like
bl
and
could
have
several
cause
of
this
that
said
this
is
a
typical
sam
adams
beer
with
a
small
twistof
adding
the
rye
drink
up
if
you
want
a
different
take
on
you
sabl
do
i
must
say
the
abv
to
flavor
ratio
is
wonderful
the
result
is
great
drinkability
the
breadygrainy
qualities
mixed
with
said
flavor
would
bring
a
bmc
drinker
to
his
or
her
knees
best
of
the
bbc
spring
sampler
pack
keep
it
around
jim
d
hell
yea
its
great
for
a
sessionable
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
one
o
its
alright
seems
like
a
decent
fall
beer
a
little
too
dry
for
the
summer
season
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
oily
slick
coating
which
is
subtlety
sweet
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
as
well
this
beer
is
okay
the
rye
flavor
is
slightly
muted
to
me
this
beer
is
just
put
more
beer
out
in
the
name
of
samuel
adams
its
ok
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
o
decent
i
wish
theyd
sell
beers
like
this
in
their
seasonal
6pack
versions
rather
than
just
the
usuals
like
summer
ale
i
bought
another
seasonal
12pack
just
to
get
2
more
of
these
but
its
getting
ridiculous
since
i
give
away
most
of
the
other
beers
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
amber
body
with
a
light
fizzy
2
finger
heat
that
lays
down
quickly
to
a
nice
sticky
lace
the
smell
is
very
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
sweet
to
start
off
but
it
finishes
with
a
hop
flavor
almost
like
a
strong
ipa
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thick
but
smooth
overall
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
pours
a
big
two
finger
head
slightly
off
white
and
pretty
foamy
its
sticking
around
very
well
but
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
lacing
ill
get
out
of
it
the
body
is
a
dark
amber
color
and
has
mediumlarge
amounts
of
carbonation
the
body
is
slightly
see
through
but
for
the
most
part
its
too
dark
to
see
through
overall
it
looks
very
nice
the
head
has
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while
and
is
giving
good
lacing
this
beer
smells
like
a
scotch
ale
to
me
its
got
a
big
malt
flavor
to
it
and
a
very
sweet
molassesmaple
syrup
smell
to
it
not
much
hop
aroma
at
all
on
the
smell
overall
it
smells
ok
but
frankly
i
think
it
will
be
way
too
sweet
the
taste
is
very
interesting
pretty
unique
first
thing
i
taste
is
that
molassesmaple
syrup
taste
and
its
not
nearly
as
overpowering
as
i
thought
it
would
be
there
is
then
a
taste
that
i
cant
quite
identify
it
might
be
the
rye
but
ive
had
rye
beers
before
and
i
usually
dont
get
a
taste
like
this
its
kind
of
like
an
alcoholy
plant
like
taste
its
really
weird
is
it
a
terrible
taste
no
but
its
very
strange
in
the
finish
you
get
a
little
bit
of
a
metallicy
taste
which
is
strange
because
this
is
out
of
a
bottle
overall
the
taste
is
a
little
watered
down
and
in
the
flavors
that
i
do
get
its
only
ok
part
of
me
wants
to
give
this
beer
a
3
5
on
taste
because
its
not
a
bad
taste
and
its
yummy
in
some
areas
but
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
it
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
and
its
not
too
amazing
of
a
flavor
it
really
wouldnt
be
fare
to
all
the
good
beers
ive
given
3
5
the
drinkability
is
ok
not
amazing
but
decent
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
got
decent
carbonation
and
its
big
enough
for
the
style
overall
its
an
ok
beer
a
little
complex
but
it
lacks
the
flavor
not
worth
buying
a
mix
pack
just
to
get
it
not
something
i
would
seek
out
pours
a
bright
reddish
hue
clear
with
a
thin
head
some
lacing
smell
is
very
impressive
sweet
honey
whole
grain
earthy
scent
taste
is
not
as
impressive
as
scent
hops
is
there
rye
not
so
much
has
some
nice
nice
qualities
but
has
a
bad
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thin
even
a
bit
watery
overall
not
my
favorite
overall
a
simple
and
forgettable
rye
beer
nothing
really
pops
out
here
and
the
rye
seems
too
toned
town
to
make
an
impact
on
the
flavour
this
is
too
bland
for
my
tastes
taste
sweet
malty
flavor
with
a
little
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
there
is
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
in
the
background
eh
its
not
that
bad
at
least
its
crisp
and
rather
refreshing
but
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
to
offer
in
terms
of
complexity
or
uniqueness
samuel
adams
revolutionary
rye
ale
is
a
very
clear
and
very
sparkling
amber
ale
with
a
foamy
yellowish
off
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
rye
lemon
grapefruit
and
grass
it
has
a
smooth
lively
mediumlight
body
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
its
a
simple
well
balanced
flavor
thats
pretty
dry
with
rye
flavor
throughout
it
seems
like
there
are
american
hops
complementing
the
rye
but
theres
also
something
pretty
grassy
going
on
in
there
its
amply
bitter
and
it
leaves
me
thirsty
enough
to
need
another
sip
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
blow
my
palate
overall
this
beer
is
okay
but
lacking
the
big
hit
of
rye
that
i
wanted
the
berry
esters
kind
of
bury
everything
other
than
the
caramel
and
bread
for
me
revolutionary
rye
ale
is
a
decent
rye
ale
not
earthshaking
however
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
o
not
a
ton
of
flavors
blending
together
but
not
bad
its
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
but
differentiated
enough
to
keep
you
curious
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
bready
malt
as
well
as
a
lot
of
rye
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
rye
and
toffee
as
well
as
some
bready
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
orange
citrus
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
the
best
beer
from
boston
beer
company
but
i
am
a
sucker
for
rye
beers
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
nice
poured
this
into
the
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
out
of
respect
i
actually
use
this
glass
for
lots
of
beers
respectable
two
finger
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
with
some
fine
clinging
lace
color
is
a
11
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
mostly
of
hops
lots
of
them
with
a
little
wheat
and
a
touch
of
rye
flavor
leans
to
the
hop
side
with
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
lime
with
a
wheat
bread
taste
next
and
a
faint
hint
of
rye
i
thought
i
would
taste
much
more
rye
good
full
feeling
in
my
mouth
smooth
like
cream
with
cling
and
just
about
the
right
amount
of
zing
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
rye
flavor
but
what
i
got
from
this
beer
was
good
but
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
good
flavor
anyway
and
if
i
see
it
again
i
will
get
some
d
this
had
a
pretty
weak
scent
and
taste
but
at
least
it
was
clean
and
really
easy
to
drink
like
the
sam
adams
pale
ale
with
a
hint
of
rye
i
wish
there
was
more
rye
and
less
breadiness
kind
of
disappointing
now
i
want
a
hop
rod
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
with
a
significant
offwhiteecru
colored
head
that
persists
quite
nicely
beer
itself
is
an
attractive
ambermedium
copper
aroma
is
pleasant
but
is
overly
dominated
by
hoppycitrus
notes
the
anticipated
malty
rye
presence
is
barely
detectable
in
and
of
itself
the
taste
is
solid
and
enjoyable
but
once
again
i
had
hoped
for
a
more
significant
rye
flavor
the
rye
is
realy
only
to
be
found
in
a
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
sour
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
typically
sa
which
is
to
say
moderatley
fullbodied
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
certainly
would
have
appreciated
more
rye
character
throughout
rye
beers
are
fun
and
easy
and
im
all
about
it
pour
from
12
oz
bottle
to
snifter
and
it
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
moderate
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
didnt
hang
around
very
long
on
the
nose
were
orange
citrus
with
spicey
rye
the
first
taste
was
sweet
malt
and
then
the
citrus
hoppy
rye
a
little
thin
an
ok
beer
i
was
just
wishing
and
waiting
for
more
flavor
to
burst
forth
d
ok
drinking
could
use
some
more
sweetness
maybe
im
just
not
good
at
reviewing
beer
i
like
it
all
the
thing
with
sam
adams
though
is
recently
i
feel
the
quality
has
gone
downhill
i
think
they
have
weakened
the
taste
of
their
beers
to
appeal
to
the
masses
or
maybe
my
taste
has
just
gone
to
the
stronger
beers
anyway
this
beer
is
above
average
as
far
as
sam
adams
beer
goes
at
least
30
stronger
than
the
boston
lager
maybe
thats
why
i
like
it
i
expected
an
average
rating
from
ba
though
so
not
surprised
the
bros
gave
it
a
c
pretty
much
what
i
expect
from
sam
adams
a
solid
beer
again
the
hops
here
are
a
bit
better
than
other
sa
products
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
nice
price
as
well
o
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
but
it
has
little
to
no
rye
character
if
you
want
rye
beers
turn
to
bear
republic
for
ryevenator
and
hop
rod
rye
revolutionary
rye
is
an
inobtrusive
sweetish
beer
that
would
work
as
an
outstanding
session
beer
but
it
misses
the
mark
as
a
rye
beer
in
most
ways
d
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
one
they
should
have
used
more
and
stronger
hops
i
really
like
ryeipa
hybrids
i
dont
think
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
taste
is
similarly
disappointing
the
rye
is
bairly
there
and
it
is
difficult
to
determine
if
the
toasted
malt
or
hops
are
weakest
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
altogether
this
is
a
disappointing
effort
it
fails
to
insult
or
impress
overall
this
was
pretty
good
again
i
dont
really
know
too
much
about
it
but
it
o
even
though
there
was
not
enough
rye
character
for
me
i
still
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
negative
points
for
being
away
from
what
i
want
for
a
rye
but
bonus
points
for
being
overall
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
impression
drinkable
and
decent
but
nothing
overly
exciting
here
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
light
body
a
light
crisp
feel
and
an
overall
subtle
sweetness
that
flows
down
easy
a
real
nice
beer
that
has
just
enough
rye
to
make
it
different
yet
is
still
close
enough
to
a
standard
beer
that
this
could
make
a
good
session
beer
o
my
least
favorite
sa
brew
from
the
spring
variety
pack
clear
and
bright
red
hued
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
in
the
glass
smell
is
very
light
caramel
and
other
base
malts
maybe
a
bit
of
gassy
hop
and
a
touch
of
yeast
but
everything
is
very
mild
the
taste
is
nice
but
nothing
special
it
is
a
basic
amber
ale
with
all
of
the
expected
malt
profile
hop
bitterness
is
pretty
solid
and
reminiscent
of
the
boston
lager
the
rye
doesnt
add
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
maybe
a
bit
of
contrast
to
the
hops
but
not
much
beyond
that
body
is
medium
along
with
average
carbonation
and
dry
finish
make
the
mouthfeel
pretty
good
overall
im
not
entirely
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
had
limited
exposure
to
rye
beers
mainly
in
the
form
of
homebrewed
examples
where
the
rye
was
a
much
more
predominate
player
in
the
taste
profile
i
expected
something
more
along
those
lines
and
this
beer
and
it
wasnt
to
be
had
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
rye
beer
d
a
wellbalanced
flavor
and
light
body
makes
this
one
quite
easydrinking
overall
this
beer
was
decent
nothing
outstanding
but
i
would
drink
it
ahain
i
like
rye
in
my
beer
and
it
is
nice
to
see
it
going
around
sam
adams
rye
12ozs
into
nonic
nice
redamber
color
with
a
very
light
tan
12
head
leaving
nice
lace
caramel
dominates
the
nose
along
with
pale
malts
and
very
little
rye
flavor
is
of
their
celebrated
irish
red
but
not
so
heavy
in
the
crystal
department
feels
full
in
body
with
perfect
carbonation
in
my
opinion
i
typically
enjoy
a
lighter
higher
ibu
rye
than
this
with
a
thinner
body
but
this
beer
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sa
line
up
once
again

decent

from
sa

kinda
has
a
sharp
bite
to
it
as
well
i
kinda
like
it
but
it
isnt
an
alltime
favorite
wont
mind
having
a
couple
in
their
sampler
a
few
times
this
summer
though
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
sam
adams
usually
does
a
pretty
stable
job
with
their
beers
they
are
usually
pretty
good
overall
im
not
gonna
lie
this
was
one
of
the
motivating
factor
in
me
buying
the
spring
mixed
12
pack
and
im
a
little
disappointed
with
it
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
winter
one
its
something
different
from
sam
but
i
think
they
need
to
stop
playing
it
so
safe
with
some
of
this
stuff
and
just
make
it
more
interesting
i
see
no
compelling
reason
why
i
would
want
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
if
it
were
available
and
other
than
the
taste
of
rye
nothing
about
this
stands
out
this
feels
like
sam
has
a
standard
ale
recipe
that
they
just
tweaked
to
add
rye
to
it
is
a
decent
rye
beer
but
it
just
feels
uninspired
oh
well
i
guess
i
should
pay
more
attention
to
reviews
when
picking
up
sam
adams
now
not
a
bad
beer
except
the
noble
pils
most
sam
adams
beers
taste
watered
down
to
me
now
theyve
gotten
progressively
worse
over
the
years
overall
impression
meh
not
good
not
bad
not
hoppy
enough
to
push
the
limits
and
not
enough
malt
character
to
keep
it
interesting
seems
a
little
too
safe
for
me
well
crafted
but
forgettable
im
not
sure
how
long
its
been
exactly
since
i
last
sampled
a
brand
new
brew
from
sam
adams
as
opposed
to
just
new
to
me
but
it
feels
like
a
long
time
this
n00b
pours
a
clear
amberrusset
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
spicy
rye
bread
my
favorite
kind
caramel
orange
peel
and
a
touch
of
pine
in
the
distance
the
taste
really
runs
with
the
spice
idea
bringing
in
a
bunch
o
black
pepper
nutmeg
and
clove
some
rye
and
sourdough
bready
up
the
works
a
bit
only
to
have
some
toasted
toffee
rush
in
and
take
everything
over
things
are
a
bit
too
disjointed
for
my
liking
with
the
various
strong
flavors
all
vying
for
my
tongues
attention
without
any
semblance
of
cooperation
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
an
okay
rye
beer
but
the
competing
flavors
just
dont
do
it
for
me
in
the
long
run
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
will
probably
share
away
what
i
have
and
not
purchase
this
again
a
solid
rye
beer
with
nice
flavors
and
balance
and
a
surprisingly
full
bodytexture
the
revolutionary
rye
ale
just
lacked
anything
and
everything
it
had
a
very
slight
taste
which
faded
very
quickly
the
aftertaste
was
stale
and
hollow
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
it
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pretty
basic
but
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
has
nice
body
this
is
a
pretty
good
sipper
overall
this
is
not
a
very
characteristic
rye
but
a
decent
sipper
drinkability
this
is
a
good
sessionable
ale
its
not
overpowering
with
hops
rye
or
body
just
good
not
worth
trying
could
easily
throw
a
6
pack
of
this
back
if
you
want
the
rye
beer
get
founders
red
rye
or
hot
rod
red
rye
d
quite
the
sessionable
offering
from
folks
at
boston
beer
a
solid
beer
for
any
occasion
unfortunately
a
beer
named
revolutionary
rye
should
make
much
more
a
rye
punch
the
rye
is
quite
timid
but
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
offering
overall
im
underwhelmed
by
this
offering
i
wasnt
expecting
the
total
lack
of
soul
this
rye
beer
serves
up
its
not
bad
by
any
means
just
weak
and
lacking
in
my
opinion
an
average
beer
and
not
one
i
would
recommend
overall
a
decent
version
of
a
rye
overall
pretty
good
its
like
noble
pils
with
a
hint
of
rye
and
bit
more
pale
and
crystal
malts
very
drinkable
i
love
rye
i
think
more
in
this
beer
would
have
made
it
better

but
the
interest
factor
isnt
there
for

not

pretty

this
is
a

with

fairly

having

enough
it

overall
this

left
me
wanting

the
alcohol
is
not

it
creeps
in
through
the
back
in
the
slew
of
sam

that
are
good
but
not
great
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
tasty
easy
drinking
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
not
a
favorite
i
would
not
turn
this
one
down
o
overall
a
fine
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
good
drink
easy
and
has
some
interesting
characteristics
an
average
attempt
at
a
rye
beer
d
this
is
a
fine
drinking
beer
but
it
needs
more
rye
character
to
really
stand
out
and
shine
i
like
the
overall
hop
and
malt
balance
but
if
you
put
rye
in
the
name
especially
in
hyperbolic
manner
i
want
it
to
be
more
apparent
in
the
actual
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
o
another
nice
offering
from
bbc
i
would
have
this
one
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
o
in
general
an
extremely
sessionable
beer
with
enough
unique
flavor
to
separate
it
from
a
standard
session
beer
would
buy
again
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
stands
well
against
others
of
its
style
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
samuel
adams
lineup
though
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
they
have
o
not

the

detracts

clings

pretty
generic
and
uninspired
stuff
but
it
isnt
awful
final
notes
just
not
doing
it
for
me
im
afraid
fairly
bland
on
the
palate
except
for
that
back
end
which
just
builds
and
kicks
you
in
your
ass
i
would
have
much
preferred
the
belgian

over
this
o
hoppier
than
i
thought
itd
be
mouthfeel
great
after
taste
on
tap
at
mccoveys
in
walnut
creek
the
tap
handle
said
seasonal
release
brought
to
the
table
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
had
no
head
whatsoever
but
after
a
little
agitating
the
whote
head
appeared
amber
color
with
white
foamy
head
that
dissapates
quickly
light
orange
aroma
with
some
definitey
hardy
rye
whiffs
but
nothing
special
taste
is
definitely
on
the
rye
side
and
malty
slight
bittering
hops
on
the
swallow
with
a
minor
ryelike
aftertaste
after
consuming
one
pint
i
was
not
looking
to
take
another
down
at
all
i
have
wanted
to
like
the
sam
adams
beers
for
along
time
but
again
and
again
i
am
not
getting
anything
that
makes
them
stand
out
from
any
other
beers
this
one
included
overall
another
good
beer
from
samuel
adams
as
with
most
of
sams
other
beers
this
beer
is
far
from
worldclass
but
is
still
an
accessible
inexpensive
beer
that
interprets
a
style
in
a
faithful
way
sam
adams
seasonal
mixed
packs
remain
a
goto
for
me
and
this
beer
is
no
different
in
that
regard
o
this
darker
wheat
beer
is
a
style
i
am
unfamiliar
with
but
am
starting
to
like
tastes
like
a
summer
baseball
game
dthe
winner
of
the
beer
lovers
choice
is
a
little
disappointing
this
is
what
people
chose
to
be
their
next
beer
however
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
o
a
somewhat
easy
drinking
beer
unfortnately
a
bit
boring
even
though
there
is
a
reasonable
combination
of
hops
and
malts
smooth
i
would
have
this
again
but
wouldnt
be
something
id
reach
for
regularly
i
would
love
to
see
the
rye
character
turned
up
a
notch
but
also
simultaneously
appreciate
the
overall
tame
nature
of
the
offering
sam
adams
makes
it
possible
for
the
uninitiated
to
enjoy
and
feel
comfortable
with
good
beer
d
fairly
drinkable
aftertaste
is
a
bit
strange
and
the
middle
of
the
taste
is
fairly
empty
feeling
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
here
otherwise
it
starts
well
and
feel
really
smooth
d
very
well
balanced
and
very
flavorful
for
a
rye
ale
it
has
some
fine
qualities
without
many
faults
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
overall
grade
bb
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
beer
a
revolutionary
rye
ale
it
tastes
like
a
very
well
made
english
esb
or
maybe
an
80
shilling
or
even
an
irish
red
a
solid
beer
fishnchips
all
the
way
but
lets
not
get
excited
here
mouthfeel
drinkability
sour
and
light
bodied
the
caramel
notes
are
pretty
tasty
but
this
is
nothing
all
that
impressive
bottle
pours
a
delightful
redcopper
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
subtle
rye
notes
caramel
and
bready
malts
taste
is
sweet
rye
malts
some
grassy
hops
towards
the
finish
exceptional
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
extremely
well
balanced
d
quite
a
drinkable
beer
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
drinkable
yes
as
are
most
sammys
worth
seeking
worth
a
try
esp
in
the
variety
pack
drinkability
goes
down
easily
but
a
style
i
dont
particularly
like
however
i
did
enjoy
this
amberbrown
in
color
with
a
small
amount
of
offwhite
head
medium
bodied
with
a
super
creamy
mouthfeel
palate
isnt
overly
complex
which
works
well
caramel
malts
modest
floral
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
black
licorice
and
raisan
from
the
rye
pretty
balanced
and
straight
forward
beer
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
would
make
a
nice
intro
to
rye
beers
d
this
beer
is
not
bad
and
is
an
easy
drinker
just
could
have
used
a
little
more
punch
imo
drinkability
is
superb
love
love
love
this
beer
could
drink
it
all
the
time
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
craggy
white
foam
on
the
surface
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
citrusy
hop
nose
as
well
a
hint
of
the
rye
can
be
noted
in
the
back
as
there
is
a
very
very
minor
touch
of
sour
the
taste
is
rather
bland
there
is
a
malty
flavor
and
thats
truly
it
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dry
and
there
is
almost
a
metallic
finish
to
it
its
a
decently
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
if
offered
to
me
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
either
d
flavorful
but
not
aggressive
and
oh
so
smooth
drinking
i
could
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
this
beer
is
one
for
the
log
books
for
me
i
hope
that
the
keg
i
had
this
from
was
not
an
anomoly
and
all
batches
for
are
this
good
my
tastebuds
rate
this
a
near
perfect
beer
pretty
clear
caramelamber
color
a
thickish
offwhite
head
sticks
all
over
the
sides
slow
carb
trailers
a
deliciouslooking
beer
smell
is
hoppy
and
blended
with
rye
malts
all
the
while
taste
is
oily
pithy
hops
with
the
same
backbone
of
roasted
barley
and
rye
clean
crackery
taste
finishes
dry
and
tight
a
bit
of
that
pithy
hops
afterwards
kind
of
a
2d
beer
but
it
is
what
it
claims
to
be
id
drink
this
one
every
so
often
d
one
of
those
middle
of
the
road
beers
that
sam
adams
puts
out
but
this
one
is
one
the
below
average
end
innocuous
and
boring
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
not
one
that
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
i
love
rye
ales
but
this
just
seems
really
busy
to
me
and
i
have
a
hard
time
enjoying
many
of
the
flavors
it
is
drinkable
and
attractive
but
it
is
not
something
i
will
ever
seek
out
again
d
a
decent
beer
id
have
another
drinkability
a
fullbodied
brew
that
would
be
great
with
a
surf
and
turf
platter
clear
chestnut
a
little
bit
of
a
burnt
orange
hue
with
a
fluffy
beige
cap
lots
of
sticky
clumpy
lacing
and
great
head
retention
looks
nice
mild
aroma
dry
malt
and
light
orange
rind
slightly
bready
moderate
citrus
bitterness
throughout
oranges
and
toasted
malt
sweet
a
bit
spicy
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
texture
was
on
the
creamy
side
but
with
a
little
crispness
towards
the
end
overall
pretty
good
for
kicking
back
with
d
drinkable
but
not
extraordinary
im
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
was
not
blown
away
overall
a
really
good
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
spiciness
keeps
things
interesting
and
dryness
makes
it
goes
down
easy
best
sam
adams
beer
ive
had
since
chocolate
bock
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
since
the
noble
pils
and
boston
lager
are
both
fine
examples
of
their
respective
styles
a
little
disappointed
although
its
not
bad
it
really
doesnt
compare
to
what
i
consider
championship
ryes
like
hop
rod
rye
for
example
it
does
have
some
rye
bite
but
fails
to
be
big
winner
i
purchased
a
12
pack
with
6
different
kinds
of
samuel
adams
but
so
far
not
a
lot
of
winners
other
than
the
two
i
already
like
the
fine
noble
pils
and
the
decent
boston
lager
skip
this
if
youre
a
serious
ryehead
but
if
you
dont
drink
ryes
that
often
and
just
want
to
have
one
its
not
too
bad
i
love
the
taste
of
rye
and
i
feel
like
this
is
a
great
rye
beer
this
beer
is
not
quite
as
smooth
as
the
terrapin
rye
beer
and
is
a
bit
sharper
with
more
tofee
character
i
find
the
hop
bitterness
a
bit
too
sharp
at
times
and
it
does
not
complement
the
rye
as
it
should
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
moderately
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
smooth
and
extremely
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
why
do
they
only
give
you
two
of
these
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
session
it
a
great
oneoff
from
sam
adams
that
i
really
hope
sees
its
way
into
general
rotation
notes
recommended
this
is
the
only
rye
beer
i
have
had
so
nothing
in
the
style
i
can
compare
to
but
i
liked
it
and
would
drink
again
the
rye
makes
an
interesting
twist

taste

dissipates
into

and
a
frothy

theres
also
a

dissipates
towards
the
finish

with

cleaning

a
decent

but
im
not
disappointed
that
there
were
only
two
in
the
12pack
an
overall
solid
drinkable
brew
d
i
had
2
and
enjoyed
it
i
really
need
to
try
some
other
rye
beers
to
better
review
this
i
will
come
back
to
this
one
again
pours
clear
amber
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
lasts
good
carbonation
and
some
lacing
subtle
pine
and
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
with
a
crisp
malt
character
a
bit
spicy
smelling
a
nice
hop
bite
in
the
flavor
is
well
pleasantly
bitter
with
a
dry
malty
finish
some
caramel
and
bread
flavors
along
with
ample
pine
resin
medium
bodied
overall
im
pretty
impressed
by
this
offering
if
it
came
out
in
its
own
6
packs
id
get
a
couple
now
and
then
the
flavor
and
character
of
rye
beers
go
really
well
with
the
pine
resin
hop
notes
in
my
opinion
this
reminds
me
alot
of
the
other
sam
adams
beers
most
have
a
few
nuiances
to
let
you
know
the
style
but
does
not
go
above
and
beyond
to
really
bring
it
all
in
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
its
a
nice
mix
up
since
the
last
2
seasonal
beers
octoberfest
and
winter
lager
are
very
good
but
very
similar
to
each
other
this
rye
ale
is
a
nice
compliment
to
the
other
spring
brew
noble
pills
i
expected
more
from
a
rye
beer
from
sam
adams
it
was
decent
but
nothing
more
overall
a
beer
that
truly
brings
the
rye
to
the
frontlines
every
aspect
of
the
ingredient
is
noticed
cereal
aromas
sourness
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
i
definitely
appreciate
the
fact
that
samuel
adams
made
this
rye
ale
truly
a
rye
ale
though
its
nothing
extraordinary
still
worth
and
try
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
addition
to
the
year
round
six
packs
bottom
line
is
this
is
a
good
tasty
beer
that
could
be
outstanding
but
is
instead
merely
a
very
tasty
drinkable
beer
ive
had
it
on
tap
its
far
better
that
way
i
really
like
rye
beers
and
dont
think
ive
ever
met
one
i
didnt
like
with
that
said
this
one
is
far
from
spectacular
but
very
solid
and
highly
drinkable
i
know
i
didnt
really
say
much
here
about
this
brew
but
theres
really
not
a
lot
to
say
about
it
the
primary
though
i
get
from
this
is
eh
this
at
the
right
price
could
be
an
all
nighter
for
me
pretty
easy
drinker
though
misses
the
rye
mark
i
think
dthe
tastes
seem
to
merge
as
the
beer
goes
on
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
to
be
honest
this
might
be
my
favorite
out
of
the
spring
seasonal
i
wouldve
much
rather
just
bought
a
12
pack
of
this
instead
verdict
im
a
little
torn
on
this
one
i
wasnt
too
sure
whether
i
liked
it
its
considered
a
rye
beer
but
i
got
a
lot
of
other
things
in
this
beer
that
took
over
on
the
flavor
its
relatively
new
so
perhaps
there
can
be
a
mend
on
that
rye
component
and
wed
have
an
award
winner
in
the
meantime
its
nothing
horrible
so
if
you
find
a
single
get
it
b
3
4
d
this
beer
is
ok
but
after
a
sip
or
two
i
dont
find
much
left
to
keep
me
interested
its
almost
like
a
bitter
boston
lager
there
are
no
major
flaws
and
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
i
think
ill
move
on
to
something
else
overall
seems
like
a
decently
crafted
beer
but
not
necessarily
something
id
go
for
again
ill
have
to
seek
out
others
in
the
rye
style
to
compare
d
id
buy
this
in
a
sampler
and
be
happy
getting
it
but
wouldnt
buy
it
alone
soft
pine
sap
sweet
and
toasty
whole
wheat
bread
malt
good
but
subtle
aroma
tastes
like
it
smells
only
toned
down
has
that
sam
adams
good
but
with
the
volume
turned
down
character
to
it
i
like
it
i
just
would
like
to
see
it
turned
up
a
few
notches
i
could
drink
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
too
bad
theres
only
2
in
this
12pk
nowhere
near
being
a
flavor
bomb
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
quaff
after
a
long
day
at
work
overall
i
was
expecting
a
big
rye
pale
ale
or
ipa
but
this
is
a
bit
more
subdued
the
hops
are
earthy
and
spicy
but
i
think
a
chop
would
fit
the
bill
better
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
an
exciting
one
i
love
sas
lager
but
this
brew
is
just
another
repackaged
sam
adams
ale
in
a
different
label
with
a
little
variation
in
ingredients
i
need
more
than
this
a
very
nice
rye
beer
lots
of
rye
bread
that
i
love
overall
fairly
simple
but
very
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
wish
this
came
in
sixers
good
overall
but
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
higher
end
rye
beers
still
its
worth
a
look
d
a
decent
brew
the
4
9
abv
makes
it
a
viable
session
option
though
this
time
of
year
i
would
definitely
take
noble
pils
over
this
samual
adams
revolutionary
rye
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appears
brownish
orange
fairly
light
and
somewhat
cloudy
long
lasting
head
and
some
lacework
down
the
glass
in
the
flavor
a
creamy
maltyness
with
a
dash
of
spicy
rye
the
peppery
ryehop
interaction
is
there
at
the
very
end
giving
way
to
a
smooth
refreshing
finish
hop
bitterness
is
mild
but
there
easy
drinking
well
rounded
decent
all
around
brew
from
bbc
overall
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
not
the
worst
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
out
there
i
dont
know
where
id
place
it
in
the
current
seasonal
sam
adams
case
but
this
was
okay
cheers
d
all
the
above
said
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
d
yeah
this
is
good
drinking
its
completely
unexciting
but
is
solid
and
fine
to
drink
nicely
carbonated
but
almost
drinks
sour
not
my
favorite
bbc
sa
beer
i
have
had
i
guess
i
just
wished
they
took
this
somewhere
new
they
probably
couldve
called
this
an
altbier
and
nobody
wouldve
noticed
samuel
adams
revolutionary
rye
ale
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
creamy
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
rye
bread
and
citric
hops
the
taste
was
malt
rye
spices
and
citrus
hops
the
finish
was
long
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
decent
rye
beer
and
worth
a
try
could
be
a
good
session
beer
d
it
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
rye
presence
as
well
as
some
more
hop
presence
id
say
that
its
worth
a
try
though
despite
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
executed
well
and
was
a
fine
addition
to
the
variety
pack
i
am
guessing
it
will
be
ultimately
forgettable
definitely
not
a
problem
to
drink
though
solid
but
not
spectacular
benefits
from
being
in
an
uncrowded
style
maybe
i
was
generous
in
this
score
since
i
cant
think
of
any
true
comparables
taste
is
a
bit
brighter
yet
quite
similar
with
a
light
buttery
caramel
flavor
coupled
with
a
coarse
and
spicy
finish
which
helps
embolden
the
feel
a
bit
pretty
full
bodied
for
a
sam
beer
yet
not
overly
malty
either
making
for
a
simple
yet
quaffable
brew
which
improves
with
some
warming
though
not
likely
to
start
a
revolution
anytime
soon
this
is
a
good
offering
from
sam
lacking
only
in
the
hops
department
on
the
aroma
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
this
is
pretty
good
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
he
taste
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
d
a
decent
brew
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
no
issues
decent
nose
and
a
good
flavor
d
well
another
drinkable
beer
from
samuel
adams
what
more
could
you
expect
this
beer
is
very
balanced
and
drinkable
to
me
i
liked
the
subtle
hints
of
rye
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
i
always
enjoy
the
drinkability
of
the
sam
line
i
think
its
worth
a
try
and
if
they
ever
made
this
in
a
12
pack
for
about
12
99
or
less
that
would
be
awesome
i
think
id
try
this
again
sometime
cheers
would
i
have
this
again
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
decent
addition
to
sas
arsenal
of
beers
d
easygoing
but
if
im
doing
pale
ale
its
not
my
first
pick
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
fades
fast
the
smell
is
not
very
powerful
some
malt
rye
and
sweet
notes
nothing
that
jumps
out
starts
citrus
and
sweet
with
some
strong
rye
notes
up
front
and
that
are
the
main
focus
throughout
the
rye
flavor
gets
stronger
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
tone
and
a
potent
aftertaste
a
mediumlight
body
nice
carbonation
and
flavor
balance
this
beer
seems
like
it
went
through
a
few
test
phases
before
settling
on
a
finished
product
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
this
one
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
a
great
drinker
a
very
refreshing
beer
a
nice
surprise
as
i
wasnt
expected
much
d
not
my
favorite
tick
from
sam
adams
but
a
cool
rye
beer
i
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
heavy
handed
on
the
hops
though
nice
drinkable
rye
beer
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
pours
a
perfectly
pale
copper
hue
with
a
bright
off
white
head
froms
fine
speckled
lacing
scattered
around
the
sides
of
my
sam
smith
imperial
pint
glass
the
rye
gives
it
a
bit
of
girth
the
head
holds
together
really
well
and
has
a
dimpled
rising
bread
dought
appearance
aroma
has
a
nice
spicy
rye
with
hints
of
pinecitrus
in
the
american
hop
additions
overall
presence
of
caramel
malt
and
breadiness
makes
for
a
nicely
balanced
beer
spicy
rye
assertive
bready
malt
character
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
pine
and
citrus
hops
bursts
but
doesnt
kill
with
bitterness
just
a
nice
complementary
hoprye
combo
not
overdone
in
anyway
medium
bodied
ale
a
bit
of
extra
girth
from
the
rye
additions
carbonation
was
mellow
and
smooth
on
the
palate
nice
change
of
paced
from
the
typical
beers
that
sam
adams
has
been
putting
out
coastal
wheat
blackberry
witbier
summer
wheat
and
white
ale
how
many
mediocre
wheat
beers
do
you
have
to
have
again
a
simple
balanced
take
on
the
style
from
sa
drink
it
if
its
there
but
there
are
many
more
exciting
and
impressive
examples
out
that
i
would
recommend
before
this
one
poured
a
very
nice
copper
color
although
with
just
a
bit
of
initial
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nice
scent
with
a
decent
sweet
malty
tone
under
a
crisp
and
semispicy
rye
aroma
nice
taste
a
very
good
pale
ale
start
with
a
good
pepperyrye
taste
as
it
goes
down
followed
with
just
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
went
down
very
smoothly
one
of
the
smoothest
rye
beers
ive
had
although
without
quite
as
much
rye
flavor
as
usual
either
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
july
pours
a
translucent
burnt
orange
with
a
thin
head
tons
of
lacing
aromas
of
yeast
orange
and
malts
taste
is
more
of
the
same
orange
with
a
bit
of
a
sourness
to
it
yeast
and
malts
this
brew
is
kind
of
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
sam
adams
decent
but
doesnt
really
impress
fourthbeer
rating
below
average
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
and
the
breadiness
gets
somewhat
monotonous
quickly
bbc
seems
like
its
trying
too
hard
here
drinkability
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
the
tastes
of
this
beer
are
so
well
balanced
that
the
drink
goes
down
nice
and
easy
an
awesome
new
selection
from
sam
that
i
would
recommend
for
anyone
i
will
be
upset
when
this
one
goes
away
drinkability
a
temperate
rye
brew
its
simple
but
it
satisfies
a
decent
addition
to
the
current
sa
multipack
d
a
decent
take
on
the
style
a
bit
rich
and
robust
for
the
alcohol
content
but
it
is
tasty
pretty
good
beer
well
worth
trying
but
one
that
could
be
better
as
well
two
finger
head
with
an
ample
amount
of
lacing
the
color
is
a
dark
gold
or
light
amber
color
smell
is
of
spice
and
hops
good
smell
especially
as
it
warms
up
taste
is
very
similiar
with
a
hop
taste
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
drinkiability
is
good
drink
drink
drink
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
be
tired
of
it
not
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
do
so
as
a
rye
beer
this
is
a
disappointment
i
dont
pick
up
much
rye
and
the
hops
dont
show
in
the
flavor
that
said
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
no
off
flavors
just
more
of
an
amber
ale
d
its
essentially
an
amber
ale
with
some
extra
complexity
of
flavor
of
course
its
drinkable
watch
the
unknown
abv
turn
out
to
be
like
7
though
poured
straight
from
my
growler
nice
thick
2finger
head
drinking
it
now
actually
and
its
surprising
that
the
abv
is
what
it
is
its
5
5
abv
btw
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
higher
mouth
feel
is
good
very
drinkable
it
tastes
a
bit
sweet
going
down
but
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
though
im
enjoying
it
not
as
much
as
the
sleigh
ryed
great
south
bay
brewery
ny
i
had
2
days
ago
which
is
also
a
rye
ale
i
think
its
just
sam
adams
but
i
do
enjoy
this
one
a
lot
more
than
other
beers
i
have
had
by
them
i
expected
a
bit
sweeter
taste
this
being
a
rye
ale
but
im
not
disappointed
definitely
cant
see
it
being
a
session
beer
though
might
have
it
again
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
didnt
blow
me
away
still
im
glad
i
grabbed
it
mouthfeel
has
a
slightly
dry
feeling
to
it
and
is
rather
light
but
pleasant
overall
not
a
bad
offering
from
bbc
but
i
want
more
rye
md
medium
bodied
beer
that
i
could
drink
one
or
two
of
but
not
several
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
hint
of
rye
spiciness
its
not
as
pronounced
as
some
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
standard
amberred
ale
composition
pale
and
crystal
malts
moderate
hop
bitterness
the
rye
is
present
but
basically
adds
a
touch
of
spiciness
that
compliments
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
not
overly
complex
nor
heavy
on
the
rye
it
is
however
an
excellent
session
ale
thats
accessible
to
those
new
to
rye
beers
why
cant
they
sa
make
more
beers
of
this
quality
not
that
im
only
now
finding
all
their
other
offerings
are
all
that
lame
they
have
some
good
stuff
but
this
is
a
fine
recipe
untainted
by
misguided
musings
or
palateine
dalliances
ill
echo
the
feelings
of
a
few
here
and
suggest
they
should
put
out
6pks
of
this
but
whats
the
point
overall
a
toneddown
rye
malt
bill
where
the
subtle
european
hops
were
showcased
nicely
against
the
rye
malt
a
slight
toffeelike
backdrop
with
a
delicately
spicy
middle
ala
the
rye
malt
and
earthy
hops
beautifully
balanced
and
dare
i
say
a
wonderful
springtime
beer
amber
colored
ale
with
a
medium
creamy
white
head
slight
roasted
malt
aroma
that
gets
taken
over
by
a
fruity
hop
presence
coppery
flavor
with
a
slight
bitterness
from
the
rye
a
little
bit
too
heavy
on
the
citrus
from
the
hops
i
would
really
like
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
to
come
through
in
the
flavor
medium
bodied
and
not
too
dry
with
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
despite
the
slight
dryness
a
good
beer
and
something
i
would
drink
again
but
could
benefit
from
toning
down
the
hops
a
bit
d
not
bad
went
well
with
the
burger
i
had
still
same
old
same
old
taste
ok
good
rye
introduction
quaint
spiciness
wouldnt
call
it
revolutionary
tastes
like
a
lot
of
their
more
popular
stuff
with
just
a
component
of
it
rye
based
malt
definitely
easy
to
drink
a
little
curve
ball
for
you
could
definitely
be
something
really
appreciated
by
people
moving
up
from
bmc
pretty
smooth
slgihtly
sweet
aftertaste
mild
presence
of
alcohol
decent
beer
overall
the
rye
makes
its
presence
known
but
isnt
overpowering
d
this
is
a
drinkable
rye
beer
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
from
a
samuel
adams
glass
this
beer
is
a
very
clear
medium
amber
color
modest
head
with
just
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
lacking
with
a
slight
spiciness
and
a
grain
scent
the
taste
is
very
nice
lots
of
malt
and
grain
flavors
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
framing
sweetness
and
firm
bitterness
firm
and
semifull
body
nice
beer
hmm
didnt
even
know
sam
adams
came
out
with
a
new
beer
part
of
the
new
spring
mixed
sampler
pack
pours
a
light
amber
color
faint
bready
aroma
to
it
taste
is
pretty
light
bodied
some
nice
spiciness
to
it
breadiness
and
rye
definitely
come
through
pretty
decent
taste
for
such
a
light
bodied
beer
nothing
too
big
here
but
definitely
drinkable
for
sure
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
but
its
generally
a
boring
style
in
my
opinion
pours
a
crystalclear
amber
color
with
a
very
tiny
white
head
that
is
gone
with
the
blink
of
an
eye
scent
is
hoppy
with
hints
of
rye
bread
there
are
also
some
piney
notes
with
spices
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
exactly
how
it
smells
very
interesting
tasting
beer
it
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
german
backbone
the
rye
flavors
and
bready
notes
are
definitely
there
with
some
strong
malt
and
gentle
hops
it
ends
with
slightly
bitter
and
very
sweetspicy
flavors
that
arent
very
appealing
not
digging
the
finishing
flavors
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
with
very
clean
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
fairly
high
despite
the
unattractive
finish
dm
very
crisp
and
drink
able
not
too
overpowering
it
really
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
the
rye
aspect
is
not
very
evident
it
appears
to
be
too
watered
down
i
wanted
more
of
a
rich
bite
to
the
beer
drinkability
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
not
terribly
unique
its
nice
to
taste
the
rye
but
it
could
be
a
little
more
prominent
ill
first
say
that
im
not
a
fan
of
rye
and
most
beers
with
rye
in
it
so
me
finding
this
as
drinkable
as
i
did
was
rather
surprising
but
really
the
flavor
and
aroma
just
arent
very
interesting
worth
a
try
from
the
sampler
pack
though
i
suppose
d
not
exactly
as
assertive
as
i
was
hoping
for
emboldening
all
the
flavors
would
do
this
beer
some
good
especially
bringing
the
rye
to
a
more
prominent
position
and
adding
more
spiciness
poured
into
a
slender
pint
glass
yazoo
brewing
co
deep
copper
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
the
rye
and
spicy
hops
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
the
tang
of
the
rye
shows
throughout
the
brew
medium
carbonation
and
the
body
is
medium
as
well
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
the
beer
has
nice
carbonation
and
a
dark
redorange
color
it
smells
like
rye
i
guess
the
taste
is
nicely
malty
with
a
hop
finish
although
there
are
many
better
beers
out
there
i
always
enjoy
the
many
different
offerings
from
sam
adams
this
one
is
no
exception
spectacular
no
enjoyable
as
usual
yes
overall
a
tasty
selection
from
sa
i
could
probably
drink
a
lot
if
these
and
im
going
to
now
drinkability
is
good
tasty
beer
that
disappears
all
to
quickly
would
put
this
on
the
wont
let
you
down
list
in
the
mouth
feel
its
crisp
and
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
co2
altogether
a
good
drinking
beer
but
a
little
light
in
any
dominant
characteristic

mainly
of

some

the
flavor

also
dominated
by
rye
with
a
bitter
hoppiness
and
slight
caramel

background
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
light

creamy

overall
beer
is
to
style
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
is
not
a
bad
beer
d
quite
drinkable
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
the
flavor
more
or
less
reflects
it
the
spicy
rye
works
quite
well
with
the
pine
hop
character
and
the
rich
toasty
malt
provides
a
solid
background
for
this
relationship
to
play
out
upon
a
pretty
nice
rye
pale
ale

not

as
good

nothing
terrible

with
some

i
could
drink
a

i
remember
sampling
this
at
the
vermont
brewers
festival
back
in
july
of
2010
long
before
it
was
chosen
as
their
newest
recipe
very
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable
i
would
strongly
recommend
it

with
a
very
creamy
looking

there
is
already
some
lacing
on
my
glass
smells
very
piney
cascades
and
some
herbal
hop
notes
perhaps
a
tad
sweet
maltiness
settled
in
the
base
aromas
tastes
somewhat
crisp
and
a
little
dry
and
has
a
nice
citrus
palate
cleansing
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
rye
is
somewhat
faint
but
in
the
background
gives
a
spicey
taste
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
overall
this
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
their
regular
offering
d
easy
to
drink
and
fits
the
time
well
good
winterspring
transitional
beer
overall
drinkability
after
the
look
and
aroma
it
definitely
goes
south
not
a
bad
beer
actually
very
drinkable
but
uneventful
and
ordinary
not
a
bad
session
ale
would
try
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
flavorful
yet
drinkable
what
a
great
beer
pours
simply
gorgeous
with
deep
amber
color
and
rich
creamy
head
beautiful
nose
has
a
mixture
of
herbal
components
and
light
caramel
with
a
clean
toasty
grain
aroma
that
is
pleasing
on
the
palate
the
rye
is
apparent
but
also
blends
nicely
with
the
toasty
caramelly
sweetness
smooth
mouthfeel
and
exceptional
drinkability
yet
another
successful
craft
beer
from
this
amazing
brewery
taste
is
fantastic
and
the
color
is
right
for
a
rye
beer
as
others
have
said
it
does
have
some
sour
to
it
but
that
is
normal
for
a
rye
brew
as
usual
sam
adams
has
a
winner
good
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
too
special
drinkability
love
the
taste
but
definitely
more
of
a
beer
with
dinner
than
a
drink
as
much
as
i
can
i
enjoyed
this
one
lots
of
interesting
flavors
which
are
well
balanced
similar
to
many
other
offerings
from
sam
adams
but
tasty
just
the
same
md
super
drinkable
smooth
yet
bubbly
mouthfeel
well
done
drinkability
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
is
real
nice
but
extremely
mild
no
overpowering
moments
anywhere
would
be
a
great
session
beer
but
not
something
i
would
be
likely
to
go
for
on
a
regular
occasion
otherwise
d
a
very
malty
medium
to
heavy
bodied
rye
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
and
i
would
consider
this
beer
to
be
a
malt
bomb
i
think
that
a
bit
more
of
a
smokey
note
would
have
been
nice
in
the
beer
but
hey
it
won
the
contest
to
be
the
next
sa
beer
i
tried
this
after
having
the
belgian
ipa
that
came
in
second
in
the
taste
off
not
sure
how
this
beer
won
out
but
hey
i
wish
it
all
the
best
stay
thirsty
my
friends
a
decent
rye
beer
but
it
has
all
of
the
same
samuel
adams
bells
and
whistles
which
just
does
not
make
it
original
at
all
just
a
few
dials
of
flavor
moved
around
overall
normally
i
can
drink
a
bottle
of
sams
and
be
alright
this
one
just
isnt
drinkable
at
all
there
is
nothing
that
works
with
this
beer

nice

a

the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
it
is
a
beer
that
is
not
too
bit
for
an
average
beer
drinker
it
goes
down
well
but
has
a
strong
aftertaste
this
could
be
better
balanced
but
is
an
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
rye
ale
but
my
favorite
choice
between
sample
a
and
b
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
stay
with
the
beer
very
long
there
wasnt
much
in
the
smell
it
tasted
simialir
to
any
rye
ale
but
rather
harsh
and
just
not
as
good
full
flavor
but
the
harshness
made
it
hard
to
finsih
overall
not
bad
but
i
voted
for
the
other
dreally
full
of
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
though
if
given
limited
choices
the
taste
is
much
like
the
boston
ale
with
same
noble
hop
profile
and
yeast
flavor
w
slight
elelent
of
toasted
rye
grain
in
the
malt
and
light
herbal
hop
quality
there
is
a
mild
vegetal
tinge
from
the
hops
w
light
tang
from
the
house
s
a
yeast
a
mild
grainy
note
w
a
pretty
good
overall
balance
from
hopsmalt
in
the
finish
which
is
relatively
clean
this
was
a
good
beer
not
a
great
one
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
ale
i
would
probably
drink
this
if
available
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
not
my
first
choice
in
the
challenge
between
it
and
the
belgian
ipa
but
it
is
ok
for
the
style
d
wouldnt
buy
it
definitely
not
digging
this
beer
of
the
two
samples
the
belgian
ipa
is
definitely
better
by
a
small
margin
i
testdrove
this
at
brew
fest
in
des
moines
over
the
weekend
thanks
for
the
keychain
i
picked
this
one
because
the
belgian
seemed
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
and
was
slightly
less
flavorful
it
did
have
the
rye
taste
to
it
but
it
seemed
much
more
likeable
that
other
ryes
ive
had
the
body
was
good
with
a
bit
of
a
bunch
when
it
hit
the
taste
buds
it
went
down
with
a
bit
fo
a
sting
but
was
enjoyable
it
was
good
to
place
this
booth
near
the
entrance
so
i
didnt
have
many
other
beers
lingering
on
my
tongue
sampled
this
one
at
sams
quick
shop
alongside

a
poured
a
crisp
copper
orange
with
barely
any
head
aroma
was
sweet
malts
spicy
rye
and
a
trace
of
hops
the
taste
is
not
much
more
than
a
standard
amber
ale
with
just
a
slight
kick
of
rye
some
caramel
malts
slight
rye
spice

mild

the
beer
is
crisp

i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
proved
to
be
nothing
special
at
all
it
didnt
come
close
to
its
belgian
ipa
competition
worth
a
try

average
d
the
mouthfeel
would
portend

without

will
definitely
pick
some
more
up
either
next

generally
i
am

a

concerned
about
rye

because
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
breads
but
it
is
amazing
how
different

two
can

anything

it

nothing

makes
straightforward
solid

like

unless
its

nothing
stands
out

a
pretty
good
take
on
a

overall
this
brew
is
very
enjoyable
it
comes
off
as
a
rye
ipa
vs
a
rye
beer
is
this
one
of
those
beers
that
a
brewer
throws
in
as
a
curve
ball
to
keep
you
guessing
on
the
style
if
so
i
like
it
there
isnt
any
really
negative
things
to
say
about
this
brew
back
to
basics
this
brew
is
recommended
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
am
not
sure
what
i
got
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
i
got
the
wrong
beer
as
i
did
see
the
pour
from
the
tap
i
definitely
need
another
shot
at
this
because
if
the
next
one
equals
this
one
i
could
up
my
rating
great
rye
nice
hearty
and
rustic
tones
on
it
consistent
flavor
easy
drinker
if
you
are
looking
for
a
regular
rye
to
go
to
this
would
definitely
be
one
to
consider
overall
a
mild
disappointment
rye
brews
have
grown
on
me
lately
but
this
example
doesnt
quite
meet
the
standard
numerous
others
have
still
a
solid
brewery
o
of
the
510
rye
beers
ive
tried
to
date
this
might
be
the
most
delicate
and
best
for
a
newcomer
4
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
wish
i
liked
it
more
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
rye
flavors
being
this
dominant
and
clashing
with
the
hops
worth
a
try
as
i
always
tip
my
hat
to
a
brewer
who
decides
to
try
something

leaves
you
with
a
nice
rye
spiciness
over
hop
notes
and
bitterness
even
aged
this
one
is
up
there
with
the
best
the
taste
does
bring
out
a
touch
of
those
rye
grains
but
this
is
really
about
the
hops
in
my
opinion
floral
citrus
bitter
hops
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
lighter
amber
color
there
was
a
small
offwhite
head
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
any
lacing
surprisingly
lighter
aroma
for
an
8
beer
some
sweet
malts
a
hint
of
rye
and
a
hint
of
spices
the
taste
is
good
but
not
too
exciting
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
touch
of
the
rye
and
spices
good
but
could
be
better
so
my
basic
proclamation
is
this
this
is
an
ipa
for
people
who
dont
like
ipas
i
will
be
seeking
out
other
rye
ipas
to
compare
taste
palate
there
is
a
big
full
bodied
malty
base
with
a
good
mix
of
bready
sweetness
and
spice
up
front
this
is
quickly
balanced
with
solid
hop
bitterness
and
orange
like
citrus
hop
flavor
notes
o
gotta
look
for
a
fresh
one
next
fall
and
try
it
then
hopefully
i
can
revise
this
review
not
bad
as
is
but
i
bet
its
much
better
before
the
hops
have
faded
overall
its
a
good
rye
beer
check
it
out
if
thats
your
thing
needs
to
be
fresh
for
proper
enjoyment
id
try
this
again
on
draft
or
in
a
fresher
bottle
maybe
but
im
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
beer
as
it
is
now
southern
tier
does
less
wrong
than
the
pope
they
are
the
bishop
of
new
york
state
microbreweries
and
a
leader
of
the
nationwide
craft
beer
revolution
theyve
been
a
favourite
of
mine
since
i
first
discovered
craft
beer
and
to
this
day
i
find
their
seasonals
so
good
as
to
warrant
crossborder
trips
2xrye
made
the
last
run
especially
worthwhile
overall
this
was
a
very
good
ipa
i
would
certainly
love
to
try
them
again
good
well
rounded
beer
pours
with
a
deep
head
the
aroma
is
bright
and
citrusy
the
body
is
pretty
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
body
not
too
light
the
first
thing
i
taste
is
the
citrus
flavor
and
a
second
or
two
later
a
fair
bitterness
its
not
too
hoppy
but
is
balanced
by
the
tangy
rye
flavor
nothing
is
overwhelming
but
complement
each
other
nice
balance
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
nothing
unique
but
nicely
executed
almost
more
of
an
ipa
decent
beer
non
the
less
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
even
if
each
individual
category
wasnt
particularly
remarkable
i
e
4

this
beers
qualities
seem
to
really
complement
each
other
well
in
a
way
that
reminds
me
of
bells
two
hearted
and
ballast
point
sculpin
well
crafted
and
definitely
something
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
in
the
future
always
love
southern
tier
overall
our
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
is
its
robust
dedication
to
the
rye
base
through
the
flavoring
the
taste
remains
flushed
with
rye
at
every
turn
taking
the
form
of
the
savory
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
it
mixes
well
at
each
of
these
stops
with
the
surrounding
fruit
hops
and
medicinals
keeping
things
warm
hearty
and
pleasant
this
is
really
a
fantastic
brew
it
is
different
enough
from
not
only
their
stock
but
of
the
entire
local
upstate
ny
stock
making
it
a
stand
out
on
numerous
levels
all
while
keeping
it
heavy
enough
to
appeal
to
people
seasonally
it
is
also
kind
of
a
blend
between
the
dark
and
the
light
and
with
hoppy
enough
brightness
to
appeal
to
the
hop
heads
alike
their
best
2x
to
date
pours
a
nice
copper
color
very
little
head
slightly
hoppy
odor
taste
is
malty
with
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
first
experience
with
a
double
rye
wasnt
really
what
i
expected
didnt
have
as
much
rye
flavor
as
i
was
looking
for
dont
know
if
this
is
common
for
this
variety
of
beer
or
not
my
aggro
pour
created
just
better
than
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
buttonbright
beautiful
copperyamber
srm

nose
had
a
big
black
pepper
and
peppermint
bite
and
my
mouth
was
already
beginning
to
water
at
the
prospect
of
this
one
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
and
the
minty
pepperiness
was
like
a
celebration
on
my
poor
aching
tongue
the
finish
left
me
literally
breathless
like
i
had
been
drinking
mouthwash
in
terms
of
its
intensity
i
was
minty
fresh
and
so
was
this
beer
the
lacing
that
began
to
form
in
the
glass
was
beautiful
and
sticky
and
i
found
myself
not
worrying
about
getting
it
off
the
taste
is
good
with
nice
maltiness
fromthe
rye
with
mild
hop
flavors
backing
it
up
with
a
slight
toasted
and
woody
combo
with
light
citrus
in
the
background
and
nice
level
of
spice
with
a
gentle
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
not
quite
a
rye
ipa
but
strong
and
has
good
rye
malt
taste
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
an
ok
beer
but
it
is
lacking
quite
a
bit
in
terms
of
flavor
and
aroma
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
the
combination
of
a
very
attractive
looking
two
tone
orange
amber
body
and
a
nice
two
finger
thick
beige
head
looked
very
inviting
upon
pour
the
aroma
was
quite
a
lovely
mix
of
floral
rye
and
citric
hops
the
taste
was
heavy
on
the
grains
with
sour
spicy
flavor
given
off
by
the
rye
which
was
counterbalanced
by
citric
hops
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
from
roasted
grains
the
finish
was
prickly
in
its
feel
as
the
rye
was
allowed
to
rule
the
roost
the
beer
felt
very
dry
and
lean
as
well
with
not
a
lot
of
sticky
coating
very
nice
burps
after
a
few
sips
i
like
the
amount
of
rye
shown
off
here
little
under
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
islands
of
larger
bubbles
break
up
an
otherwise
even
surface
peters
out
to
a
thick
accretion
along
the
glass
edges
the
lacing
is
broad
and
gluey
in
some
spots
covers
everything
from
liquid
surface
to
top
rims
very
clear
to
the
point
of
almost
diminishing
its
color
coppery
orange
to
lighter
red
more
orange
to
yellow
at
rims
and
glass
bottom
sluggish
bubbles
straightforward
nose
crisp
and
openly
knit
sweet
orange
to
pink
grapefruit
zest
the
rye
comes
through
easily
however
it
still
has
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
in
the
nostrils
mixed
sweet
grains
light
pepperiness
strong
underlying
maltiness
ripe
peach
to
nectarine
fruit
scents
maybe
banana
as
well
just
hangs
pregnantly
like
a
rain
cloud
in
the
mouth
it
is
mediumbodied
soft
and
fluid
but
not
creamy
the
rye
has
an
edge
and
that
peppery
quality
is
spotlighted
grapefruit
lemon
citrus
pine
wildflowers
and
a
flourish
of
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
as
it
goes
down
the
chute
the
carbonation
is
not
steady
more
an
irregular
pulse
but
on
the
whole
keeps
the
beer
inclined
towards
dryness
leaves
a
metallic
earthiness
behind
as
residue
good
drinkability
and
could
see
putting
back
23
of
these
in
a
sitting
which
is
likely
on
the
high
end
for
this
type
of
beer
per
se
this
one
is
a
winner
o
nice
strong
rye
ale
with
good
complexity
glad
to
try
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
just
enough
rye
flavors
but
it
didnt
seem
like
the
rye
was
bold
enough
to
live
up
to
the
2x
name
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
clean
not
too
filing
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
a
couple
of
these
would
be
the
right
amount
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
pretty
good
but
i
really
liked
the
balance
and
the
hop
profile
in
the
aroma
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
still
nice
but
i
thought
the
rye
and
especially
the
hops
could
have
shown
up
more
like
they
did
in
the
aroma
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
for
a
seasonal
rye
beer
i
would
rather
have
a
ruthless
rye
i
would
recommend
this
to
rye
beer
fans
but
i
dont
think
its
a
stand
out
in
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
solid
but
if
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
aroma
then
this
would
be
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
i
think
with
a
little
tweaking
it
could
live
up
to
its
potential
this
beer
doesnt
make
me
like
southern
tier
anymore
but
it
doesnt
make
me
like
them
any
less
either
its
kind
of
right
in
the
middle
o
a
very
nice
rye
beer
it
showcases
the
rye
very
well
without
getting
too
overboard
with
it
polished
enough
and
smooth
in
texture
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
big
beer
o
a
very
sessionable
rye
beer
at
8
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
my
only
complaint
is
i
wish
the
rye
was
more
present
after
having
a
couple
worldclass
ryes
in
the
past
few
weeks
this
brew
just
doesnt
stand
up
pretty
good
just
not
my
speed
overall
a
quite
tasty
and
easy
drinking
moderately
hopped
rye
at
8
1
abv
and
being
so
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
this
one
is
a
bit
dangerous
but
regardless
is
very
nice
overall
smooth
dry
start
to
the
taste
with
a
light
and
sweet
finish
subtle
rye
and
hops
add
to
a
slight
bitterness
an
interesting
brew
but
a
bit
short
of
what
i
expected
for
a
double
rye
o
a
nice
ale
nothing
really
pops
but
it
is
really
good
overall
lots
of
spicy
rye
hops
but
i
would
have
loved
more
rye
bread
taste
this
tastes
like
a
slightly
above
average
imperial
ipa
with
lots
of
citrus
not
bad
but
nothing
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
pack
of
other
hoppy
rye
beers
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
a
stronger
rye
presence
than
the
nose
hinted
at
spicy
and
peppery
rye
dominates
the
flavor
up
front
but
is
quickly
complimented
by
dry
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
through
the
finish
dry
sticky
hops
are
very
bitter
with
grass
pine
needle
and
spruce
tip
flavor
as
it
warms
the
malts
become
more
prominent
with
caramel
sweetness
toffee
dark
fruit
bread
and
biscuit
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
making
this
beer
easier
to
drink
than
it
should
be
complex
and
well
balanced
but
the
hops
interfere
with
rye
spiciness
a
bit
too
much
for
my
preference
i
would
have
preferred
if
it
was
heavier
on
the
rye
with
a
subtle
earthy
hop
presence
unfortunately
it
was
the
other
way
around
still
this
beer
was
interesting
and
an
enjoyable
drink
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
the
2x
series
but
this
one
was
decent
a
good
package
rye
beer
2x
series
is
wearing
me
out
a
little
bit
with
all
of
the
fortified
strength
this
one
has
its
chorelike
tendencies
ok
beer
love
the
rye
component
but
the
hops
were
severely
lacking
for
a
dipa
o
a
very
good
rye
ipa
that
rivals
founders
reds
rye
in
my
opinion
appearance
is
golden
with
brilliant
clarity
head
settles
quickly
and
leaves
sparse
lace
nose
is
resinous
wih
heavy
pine
earth
and
rye
spiceness
taste
is
quite
resinous
like
the
nose
with
a
fair
amount
of
pine
needles
paired
with
bread
rye
and
a
bitter
kick
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
freh
and
hoppy
showcases
the
rye
well
balanced
wellhopped
and
easy
drinking
o
not
quite
an
outstanding
beer
but
damn
near
close
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
o
id
take
a
2xrye
over
the
legendary
2xipa
any
day
its
insanely
drinkable
with
a
full
complex
malt
character
thats
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
lets
hope
this
stays
a
seasonal
for
a
while
overall
some
rye
but
not
as
much
as
others
i
could
still
notice
it
and
it
balanced
out
with
everything
out
in
the
beer
overall
a
great
change
of
pace
for
pale
ale
drinkers
this
is
a
fairly
balanced
and
tasty
rye
based
ale
that
showcases
the
spicy
and
grainy
rye
character
with
slight
peppery
character
but
balances
with
bright
pine
hop
notes
overall
a
refreshing
rye
beer
that
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
consume
very
enjoyable
this
has
a
really
soft
feel
that
doesnt
detract
from
the
medium
body
and
a
very
nice
creaminess
that
coats
the
tongue
without
being
slick
it
works
off
a
crispness
that
leads
right
into
the
velvety
texture
price
point

6712
oz
single
o
overall
it
wasnt
my
favorite
rye
beer
or
anything
but
it
was
pretty
good
i
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
just
didnt
win
me
over
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pint
but
i
wouldnt
go
nuts
looking
for
it
it
has
the
added
benefit
of
being
over
8
without
tasting
like
alcohol
so
that
might
be
something
to
consider
if
youre
a
fan
of
imperial
versions
of
beer
styles
if
that
is
the
case
then
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
out
if
youre
just
a
rye
fan
really
it
just
provides
your
standard
rye
beer
flavors
overall
a
pretty
good
rye
not
one
that
is
so
complex
it
warrants
a
full
review
the
color
was
not
as
deep
as
i
would
expect
from
a
rye
the
mouthfeel
was
refreshing
but
rather
ordinary
one
thing
i
need
to
point
out
is
i
cannot
believe
it
is
8
for
a
stronger
beer
it
is
very
very
drinkable
not
boozy
at
all
and
quite
refreshing
heck
i
might
put
down
a
few
of
these
tonight
cheers
o
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
but
this
is
a
complex
and
tasty
double
ipa
style
beer
the
rye
adds
some
thing
to
flavor
profile
possibly
to
mouthfeel
as
well
nice
job
stbc
this
is
a
really
great
take
on
2xipa
for
rye
lovers
this
is
a
great
beer
to
try
this
is
a
very
nice
robust
rye
beer
o
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
fall
lineup
for
st
id
prefer
a
slightly
heavier
body
to
make
it
feel
more
like
an
autumn
seasonal
but
otherwise
its
really
nice
rye
and
hops
go
together
like
peanut
butter
and
jelly
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
this
combination
o
no
complaints
and
recommended
for
a
rye
beer
overall
the
rye
malt
really
lends
a
stubblysmooth
sweetness
to
this
beer
which
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
extra
hops
its
incredibly
quaffable
for
the
abv
really
without
the
hops
this
beer
would
taste
like
a
cloying
rye
doppelbock
or
something
i
love
when
southern
tier
breaks
the
rules
and
this
is
another
great
example
im
not
a
rye
fan
i
expected
to
dislike
this
beer
but
the
rye
bitterness
is
not
as
overwhelming
as
in
some
rye
beers
and
theres
enough
hop
flavor
complexity
and
depth
of
character
in
the
malt
to
keep
my
interest
the
marriage
of
hops
and
rye
seem
to
elevate
both
with
an
effortless
taste
and
spicy
bite
although
the
ale
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
high
2x
potency
i
really
wish
the
ale
had
delivered
on
its
ipa
promises
and
finish
with
the
acidic
bitterness
that
was
expected
this
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
it
is
huge
and
over
the
top
but
completely
drinkable
another
southern
tier
triumph
ov
a
solid
brew
at
8
you
cant
call
this
sessionable
but
it
drinks
like
it
is
as
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
the
flavours
are
mellow
this
goes
down
rather
easy
too
easy
for
an
8er
i
like
the
flavours
just
wish
they
were
more
pronounced
oits
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
isnt
something
ill
probably
want
again
anytime
soon
its
really
rather
boring
definitely
a
fair
example
of
theyre
style
amber
in
color
with
an
orange
hue
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a

of
booze

to
the
end
finishes
with
a
lingering
citrus
hop
and
bready
rye
aftertaste
not
terribly
complex
but
damn
good
overall
a
very
good
tasty
rye
ipa
hard
to
believe
the
strength
is
where
it
is
as
the
flavors
really
come
through
nicely
southern
tier
has
made
another
terrific
beer
brisk
friendly
and
positively
carefree
overall
i
was
pumped
for
this
being
that
i
love
st
and
rye
beers
in
general
and
this
is
tasty
really
fits
the
weather
right
now
and
is
damn
tasty
maybe
not
the
best
rye
beer
out
there
but
a
must
try
for
rye
fans
o
if
the
whole
modus
operandi
was
to
showcase
the
rye
flavors
first
and
foremost
id
definitely
say
they
succeeded
while
not
the
most
complex
its
definitely
a
very
good
rye
ale
and
one
where
i
wouldnt
have
regretted
picking
up
a
6pack
of
this
o
good
different
this
one
was
awesome
and
a
worthy
entry
into
the
2x
series
overall
nice
hoppy
red
ale
with
rye
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
as
there
is
not
much
bitterness
or
spiciness
to
combat
the
malts
and
the
surprisingly
sweet
hops
still
definitely
worth
trying

nice

not

as
i
was
expecting
but
this
was
still
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
and
this
is
another
tasty
offering
great
hop
flavor
that
doesnt
overpower
a
solid

worth
a
try
by
any

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
rye
pine
and
citrusy
tropical
fruit
grapefruit
hops
and
some
bready
malt
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
an
earthyherbal
flavor
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
liked
it
10
99
a
6pack
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
southern
tier
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
rye
but
its
well
crafted
and
enjoyable
i
like
it
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
tasty
little
number
ive
enjoyed
it
before
but
i
was
working
in
my
garage
so
i
didnt
give
rpa
the
attention
it
deserves
this
beer
pours
with
a
deep
orange
hue
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
the
nose
is
lovely
plenty
of
floral
hops
that
give
a
nice
hint
of
what
is
to
come
the
taste
is
everything
that
a
quality
brew
should
be
layered
and
ever
evolving
the
malt
rye
and
hops
blend
together
and
each
layer
pops
out
at
you
as
you
taste
it
this
beer
plays
out
like
an
ipa
with
a
nice
dry
black
pepper
finish
and
the
rye
adds
a
delightful
twist
this
is
an
awesome
brew
that
is
worth
seeking
out
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
o
been
looking
forward
to
having
this
proudly
brewed
canadian
classic
for
some
time
really
well
done
no
complaints
here
you
get
both
rye
and
ipa
here
bought
in
kitchener
drank
in

hamburg

24th
2014
overall
the
transition
from
malts
sweetness
to
hops
bitterness
is
astounding
giving
you
equal
opportunity
to
enjoy
both
the
malt
spectrum
and
hop
spectrum
of
this
beer
strong
beer
good
flavour
amazing
aroma
could
be
filtered
to
avoid
chunks
in
bottom
great
canadian
take
on
ipa
would
have
been
better
to
be
slightly
sweeter
but
the
rye
adds
an
amazing
layer
of
depth
and
complexity
to
the
beer
a
good
summer
beer
to
remind
you
of
warmth
in
those
cold
winter
months
overall
damn
good
beer
while
its
almost
unfair
to
call
this
a
rye
beer
because
of
how
similar
it
is
to
an
ipa
the
rye
is
hard
to
deny
would
recommend
to
any
beer
lover
and
cant
wait
to
buy
some
more
i
liked
this
so
much
i
am
going
to
brew
my
own
rpa
i
know
that
this
is
classified
here
as
a
rye
beer
but
cmon
the
ipa
bitterness
is
so
much
more
pronounced
than
the
admittedly
prominent
rye
malt
bill
ratio
yer
average
rye
beer
is
hardly
as
punchy
as
this
one
is
so
the
average
consumer
may
get
the
wrong
idea
at
any
rate
a
pleasant
crossbreeding
of
styles
glad
to
finally
get
a
chance
to
try
it
and
with
the
minimal
amount
of
effort
thanks
be
to
christian
overall
so
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
a
rye
beer
person
but
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
illustrates
some
of
the
possibilities
available
especially
when
crossing
with
a
hoppy
pale
ale
it
was
enjoyable
and
refreshing
albeit
an
intense
experience
and
would
definitely
pick
up
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
keeps
getting
better
the
farther
you
get
into
the
glass
definitely
recommended
for
hop
heads
overall
this
is
excellent
the
rye
works
wonders
with
the
base
caramel
malts
and
the
hop
bill
is
spot
on
a
wonderful
full
creamy
feel
as
well
between
this
one
and
sawdusts
lone
pine
ipa
ontario
can
easily
satisfy
my
hop
cravings
without
issue
world
class
beer
right
here
and
im
surprised
the
scores
arent
even
higher
absolutely
wonderful
final
grade
4
47
an
incredible
a
grade
worth
the
wait
camerons
rye
pale
ale
is
probably
the
best
ipa
ive
had
in
the
last
year
or
so
the
spicy
peppery
feel
imparted
by
the
rye
malts
is
the
perfect
companion
for
the
intensely
citrusy
earthy
flavours
of
the
hops
making
for
an
excellent
brew
that
is
certain
to
please
the
palates
of
hopheads
everywhere
this
is
easily
the
best
camerons
beer
ive
yet
tried
and
something
that
the
brewers
should
be
extremely
proud
of
if
this
is
available
regularly
youd
better
believe
ill
be
buying
plenty
more
as
this
is
definitely
a
new
favourite
for
me
the
perfect
choice
for
my
500th
beer
tick
on
ba
and
on
international
ipa
day
to
boot
final
thoughts
this
is
my
second
rye
beer
and
it
certainly
fared
better
then
the
first
that
still
being
said
rye
beer
does
not
appear
to
be
my
cup
of
tea
its
like
an
ipa
with
the
hop
kick
spread
out
a
bit
more
and
the
sweet
malt
replaced
with
its
rougher
rye
cousin
which
i
would
say
is
the
best
piece
of
advice
i
can
give
if
you
are
drinking
your
first
rye
beer
standard
beer
is
toast
and
this
beer
is
rye
bread
toast
regular
toast
tends
to
be
sweeter
the
bread
because
the
sugars
in
the
bread
caramelize
however
rye
bread
toast
doesnt
really
do
it
quite
as
well
because
well
i
dunno
i
guess
there
is
less
sugarits
hardier
either
way
rye
malt
seems
to
have
the
same
characteristic
as
there
is
next
to
nothing
remotely
sweet
here
which
makes
for
something
different
its
just
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
glad
i
tried
it
though
o
wow
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
it
sure
goes
down
easy
it
has
a
rye
beer
meets
dipa
vibe
to
it
for
some
reason
these
havent
been
moving
off
the
shelve
at
my
local
lcbo
next
time
im
in
ill
take
care
of
that
im
somehow
not
catching
all
the
nuance
of
this
one
i
guess
mostly
just
hops
to
me
but
still
a
good
quality
quaff
d
a
solid
enjoyable
ryepa
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
the
tropical
and
citrusy
notes
some
of
the
other
reviewers
mention
wondering
if
there
is
variability
to
the
hop
bill
im
fairly
certain
the
bottles
ive
had
are
fresh
overall
4
255
not
sure
if
this
is
standard
fare
for
the
style
but
if
it
is
sign
me
up
three
cheers
for
rye
beer
o
big
on
rye
spiciness
which
i
prefer
in
the
style
but
maintains
its
drinkability
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
o
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
glad
i
did
i
have
to
admit
to
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
rpa
or
ipa
beers
but
i
want
to
give
everything
a
fair
chance
it
was
good
i
would
quite
enjoy
this
with
bbq
on
a
summer
day
this
ones
a
winner
in
my
books
big
tropical
hop
blast
with
a
little
spicy
kick
no
mention
of
booze
anywhere
and
i
could
easily
drink
another
bomber
or
two
without
getting
board
i
can
see
why
this
brews
so
well
rated
and
i
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
i
can
see
why
this
popped
up
among
canadas
best
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
ale
with
a
relatively
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
malt
notes
with
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
profile
taste
is
a
great
refreshing
mix
between
some
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
citrusy
and
spicy
hops
profile
which
are
close
to
ipa
level
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
solid
beer
which
is
definitely
better
then
the
rest
of
camerons
standard
offerings
od
slightly
torn
on
this
one
without
the
rye
element
i
typically
dont
enjoy
this
would
be
a
really
solid
pale
ale
for
our
market
it
was
really
hyped
up
but
i
cant
really
see
myself
buying
this
again
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
a
hop
bomb
with
a
solid
rye
malt
base
that
offered
up
a
tasty
twist
to
what
could
otherwise
be
interpreted
as
a
generously
hopped
west
coast
ipa
overall
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
amazing
to
find
this
much
west
coast
flavour
in
an
ontario
beer
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
firestone
union
jack
with
beers
like
this
available
locally
it
makes
me
wonder
why
i
bother
ticking
random
crappy
beers
very
nice
rye
beer
a
good
amount
of
floral
and
citrusy
hops
mix
flawlessly
with
the
rye
malts
used
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
camerons
rye
pale
ale
has
enough
bitter
aggressive
hoppiness
to
be
combatoperational
but
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
eats
its
young
layered
with
a
remedying
toasty
malt
it
has
a
collected
balanced
disposition
somewhere
between
english
and
american
styles
this
canadian
brewer
found
their
own
accent
well
crafted
and
reasonably
priced
its
recommended
4
25
d
this
really
surprised
me
and
the
freshness
of
this
certainly
came
across
wont
be
hesitating
to
pick
up
more
of
this
and
glad
to
see
camerons
experiments
in
the
liquor
stores
highly
recommend
cheers
overall
this
needs
to
be
available
yearround
preferably
in
the
lcbo
grab
a
sixer
of
this
if
you
can
definitely
a
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
hoppy
aroma
of
grapefruit
citrus
with
a
light
grainyearthy
rye
component
too
nicely
pungent
bitter
hoppy
flavors
of
grapefruit
pith
and
peel
bready
rye
with
a
lingering
earthy
aftertaste
and
dry
hoppy
bitterness
medium
to
light
body
with
an
adequate
carb
level
nice
combo
of
citrus
and
rye
a
session
beer
contender
overall
a
nice
west
coast
style
rye
ipa
enjoyed
it
man
this
isnt
something
id
expect
out
of
camerons
in
ontario
to
produce
quite
frankly
the
best
beer
available
right
now
though
i
believe
its
intended
to
be
a
spring
seasonal
the
only
downside
was
the
pricing
over
16
for
the
six
pack
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
very
impressed
with
this
one
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
great
thanks
alot
thesevenduffs
o
i
dont
know
what
to
say
this
is
marvelous
just
a
solid
beer
that
needs
to
be
available
all
the
time
and
in
my
area
preferably
in
the
camerons
9pk
overall
very
nice
i
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
because
it
is
easily
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
camerons
and
would
be
a
huge
addition
to
the
ontario
beer
scene
o
a
great
beer
and
one
of
ontarios
many
bright
spots
lately
well
done
cloudy
amber
colour
nearly
a
finger
of
white
head
with
some
lace
at
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
a
blast
of
citrus
and
pine
big
chunks
of
pineapple
up
front
some
malt
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
rye
kick
mango
and
grapefruit
lots
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
scents
tasts
is
quite
hoppy
citrus
and
tropical
flavours
grapefruit
mango
as
well
spicy
malt
dry
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
finish
some
more
malt
and
spice
in
the
aftertaste
good
feel
medium
carboantion
lightly
sweet
points
followed
by
nice
drying
carbonation
oily
at
points
this
was
a
pleasure
to
have
defintley
something
i
would
drink
again
very
nice
on
tap
thanks
for
hooking
me
up
jon
overall
i
am
very
impressed
ive
never
been
impressed
with
anything
that
camerons
has
put
out
until
now
notice
alcohol
is
invisible
here
this
stuff
creeps
up
on
you
faster
than
it
should
edit
happy
to
rereview
been
drinking
a
lot
of
this
on
tap
at
the
only
great
hop
brightness
citrus
character
balanced
with
a
rye
spiciness
and
a
slight
chewiness
just
a
terrific
beer
and
perhaps
one
of
the
best
in
ontario
for
ipas
cloudy
and
sedimentridden
smells
like
raisin
and
sweet
biscuit
big
ol
rye
whiskey
barrel
taste
with
some
nice
plumdark
fruit
notes
aftertaste
is
the
same
delicious
my
on
complaint
is
i
let
this
bottle
warm
up
to
room
temperature
which
where
i
live
is
50
and
unlike
other
bottle
conditioned
beers
this
one
was
a
gusher
but
looking
past
that
it
was
the
best
foam
i
have
ever
had
nice
rye
spiciness
and
the
whiskey
flavor
and
aroma
does
wonders
its
not
stout
like
at
all
with
lots
of
chocolate
or
coffee
flavors
but
it
is
a
dark
full
bodied
beer
with
some
nice
tones
of
whiskey
and
rye
the
person
who
blended
this
is
a
magician
well
i
am
guessing
its
blended
based
on
the
ratio
but
overall
good
beer
thick
warming
great
tasting
a
classic
from
boulevard
none
of
the
flavors
punch
you
in
the
nose
but
the
nose
is
excellent
not
sure
i
would
pay
12
99
again
though
maybe
9
99
so
probably
my
last
bottle
i
will
be
looking
to
revisit
this
one
mouthfeel
is
alright
a
little
disappointing
has
a
light
feel
on
the
tongue
yet
it
has
a
really
strong
lingering
flavor
a
bit
of
a
high
carbonation
level
but
not
overly
aggressive
starts
bitter
goes
slightly
sweet
then
goes
to
a
dry
hard
bitter
finish
and
even
hot
at
the
end
good
but
not
great
beer
ive
had
it
fresh
and
aged
and
they
both
are
pretty
good
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
shared
in
my
opinion
though
its
strong
and
not
overly
deep
which
slightly
brings
down
its
drinkability
but
you
could
still
finish
it
on
you
own
if
youre
into
this
kind
of
beer
o
this
beer
kills
it
plain
and
simple
its
smooth
complex
and
just
so
good
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
boulevard
beers
that
i
look
forward
to
seeing
again
next
year
big
rye
whiskey
flavors
marry
perfectly
with
the
underlying
rye
ale
a
winner
equal
parts
strong
and
smooth
this
is
no
beer
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
poured
nicely
and
its
rich
brown
color
and
head
were
ascethitcally
pleasing
the
aroma
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
beer
aged
in
rye
whiskey
barrels
full
of
flavor
on
the
front
and
back
end
along
with
a
pleasing
aftertaste
all
in
all
very
well
crafted
brew
boozy
and
delicious
did
i
mention
its
boozy
super
strong
packed
with
flavor
its
a
buttkicker
no
doubt
its
like
taking
a
drink
of
barleywine
and
chasing
it
with
bourbon
its
obnoxious
and
if
you
dont
like
huge
beers
that
punch
you
in
the
face
then
you
need
not
imbibe
this
glorious
nectar
however
if
you
do
appreciate
the
awesomeness
that
is
a
12
whisky
barrel
aged
rye
bomb
then
by
all
means
drink
deeply
and
allow
your
palate
to
forever
be
left
wanting
great
job
once
again
boulevard
please
send
me
free
beer
jk
but
seriously
maybe
a
little
hard
on
this
to
start
as
it
improved
as
it
warmed
and
slowly
grew
on
me
still
was
hoping
for
more
sweetness
and
maybe
it
was
one
of
those
not
on
the
mood
for
this
right
now
issues
but
it
paired
nicely
with
some
dried
figs
and
i
suspect
would
be
enhance
with
some
funky
cheese
alongside
that
as
previously
mentioned
im
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
lennys
ripa
is
a
favorite
and
this
beer
takes
rye
in
a
totally
different
direction
rye
and
hop
bitterness
play
really
well
together
but
an
ipa
this
is
not
it
is
however
a
fantastic
barleywine
and
a
fantastic
way
to
showcase
oak
aging
and
also
a
really
delicious
rye
beer
boozy
number
here
no
doubt
enjoyed
growler
from
lincoln
filling
station
another
tremendous
beer
from
boulevard
at
12
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
meant
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
slow
pace
appearance
is
caramel
colored
and
cloudy
smell
is
boozy
and
rye
whiskey
taste
is
rye
and
caramel
booze
mouthfeel
is
warming
thick
and
creamy
with
whiskey
notes
overall
a
solid
5
best
whiskey
barrel
aged
beer
ive
tried
id
prefer
this
beer
to
be
a
little
drier
and
use
more
rye
malts
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
fairly
decadent
delicious
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
didnt
love
it
my
ratings
could
have
gone
a
few
different
ways
but
it
was
definitely
tasty
booziness
rules
the
day
poured
from
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
a
really
enjoyable
beer
lower
carbonation
compliments
the
flavor
a
of
the
barrel
well
d
not
as
in
depth
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
still
a
damn
fine
brew
recommend
taking
your
time
with
this
one
even
though
this
is
actually
well
balanced
and
very
approachable
not
only
because
it
is
such
a
big
beer
but
temp
really
allows
it
to
blossom
and
improves
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
think
they
blended
this
one
down
so
well
that
many
of
the
flavor
components
are
fairly
nuanced
im
torn
on
whether
this
is
one
to
cellar
or
enjoy
now
i
could
definitely
see
how
cellaring
could
improve
it
but
as
it
is
its
pretty
awesome
and
im
worried
that
cellaring
would
smooth
out
the
somewhat
rough
character
that
i
like
in
rye
decadent
masterful
beer
a
real
gem
o
overall
a
real
enjoyable
beer
something
that
each
time
you
sip
at
it
you
taste
something
new
or
a
familiar
flavor
melds
into
something
else
not
sure
i
have
my
head
wrapped
around
this
one
and
i
will
have
to
see
what
it
does
as
it
warms
with
a
little
bit
of
time
this
beer
changes
from
a
complex
brew
into
an
easy
sipping
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
savored
o
overall
a
real
treat
as
a
fan
of
rye
and
whiskey
this
one
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
me
o
would
prefer
this
to
bcbs
to
be
honest
i
am
partial
to
rye
over
bourbon
but
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
ba
beer
prost
o
a
pretty
interesting
big
beer
the
flavors
do
not
jump
out
but
i
feel
like
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
o
ryeonrye
is
a
unique
drinking
experience
it
melds
whiskey
rye
malt
and
barrel
character
with
a
deft
hand
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
young
to
get
the
best
of
all
three
my
bottle
is
probably
about
2
months
in
my
hand
and
probably
about
4
since
bottling
stellar
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
creamy
hint
of
grittiness
overall
too
hot
to
be
great
but
some
pleasant
flavors
otherwise
o
so
glad
i
got
this
at
the
bar
a
little
pricier
than
the
others
but
definitely
worth
it
ill
be
getting
the
bottle
when
i
go
to
the
shop
next
cheers
o
oh
yeah
this
hits
my
palate
in
all
the
right
places
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
its
spicy
but
not
too
spicy
its
boozy
no
fuck
that
its
not
boozy
at
all
boulevard
really
worked
wonders
here
its
so
good
i
think
ill
kill
this
750
solo
excellent
beer
but
then
again
ive
never
had
a
big
rye
i
didnt
like
this
one
was
robust
a
bit
boozy
but
not
as
much
as
i
was
hoping
for
some
fluffiness
in
the
mouthfeel
that
tells
me
there
was
plenty
of
yeast
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
comes
through
perfectly
though
i
do
detect
hop
bitterness
added
in
to
try
to
cut
into
the
sweet
and
sour
taste
maybe
not
enough
bitterness
though
the
one
thing
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
was
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
it
was
a
fun
soursweet
that
i
like
about
rye
but
both
the
sweet
and
sour
character
were
a
bit
cloying
i
wish
theyd
been
cut
into
a
bit
with
some
smoky
wood
some
roasted
malt
or
maybe
even
hops
at
the
same
time
i
know
this
was
an
experiment
into
how
big
and
how
rye
they
could
make
a
rye
beer
so
it
was
fun
to
try
but
definitely
a
cloyingly
sweet
and
sour
taste
was
left
in
my
mouth
that
was
unpleasant
best
rye
beer
ive
had
superb
this
bottle
was
fresh
but
the
rye
scent
was
all
too
soft
with
a
more
barley
grain
tone
the
rye
then
became
very
tangy
on
the
tongue
with
hints
of
grain
and
a
strong
bourbon
alcohol
taste
this
did
not
take
on
the
complexity
i
expected
nor
the
overly
overt
flavors
that
it
claimed
but
it
was
still
a
good
drink
o
big
glad
i
had
the
12oz
pour
as
a
big
bottle
would
need
34
to
enjoy
great
fireplace
sipper
for
more
moderate
suggestion

rye

choice
this
is
the
2014
edition
from
the
750
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
this
really
deserves
to
be
sat
upon
for
another
couple
of
years
but
its
delicious
now
ill
go
buy
a
couple
more
to
cellar
750ml
pint
glass
overall
great
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
o
malt
and
wood
forward
with
no
discernible
hop
flavor
or
aroma
but
just
enough
bitterness
to
provide
balance
a
classic
to
look
forward
to
each
year
poured
a
brownish
body
with
decent
head
and
lace
and
has
a
sweet
boozy
aroma
picking
up
a
good
amount
of
not
only
bourbonbarrel
notes
with
alcohol
but
love
the
dark
fruits
figsraisins
and
minor
rye
base
not
overpowering
in
the
aroma
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
chewey
and
has
some
sweetness
to
it
figs
and
plums
coming
through
with
a
little
bit
of
sugary
goodness
and
there
is
a
woodiness
and
alcohol
kick
to
this
beer
the
rye
makes
the
beer
real
smooth
and
adds
some
heat
and
alcohol
bite
to
this
beer
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
rye
is
front
and
center
in
this
beer
at
times
the
sweetness
is
puckering
but
overall
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
the
abv
is
kept
in
check
and
this
is
just
a
solid
drinking
beer
i
could
see
this
aging
great
too
bad
i
just
drank
my
only
bottle
o
one
thing
that
i
like
about
boulevards
limited
release
beers
is
that
they
only
use
a
blend
of
barrel
aged
beerscomplimenting
the
base
beer
and
allowing
the
to
shine
the
rye
plays
well
with
the
barrel
notes
and
drinks
very
easily
for
the
abv
very
good
high
b
sip
and
enjoy
overall
with
the
2014
in
hand
i
have
the
last
few
years
of
this
delicious
beer
and
am
excited
to
give
them
all
a
shot
thisyear
this
beer
ages
extremely
well
while
still
being
drinkable
first
year
overall
a
great
sipping
beer
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
as
much
as
i
have
i
normally
dont
enjoy
barrel
aged
beers
that
much
because
i
dont
like
the
taste
of
bourbon
but
maybe
i
should
give
rye
whiskey
a
try
if
its
half
as
good
as
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
to
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
keeps
this
very
drinkable
through
all
the
big
flavors
cheers
overall
good
to
really
good
beer
but
rather
pedestrian
for
boulevard
this
brewery
does
such
good
work
that
its
really
hard
to
praise
a
competent
beer
from
them
its
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
could
be
amazing
for
someone
else
must
try
for
those
who
like
rye
beers
but
know
that
this
is
very
sweet
with
notes
of
cherry
lemon
and
orange
connotes
bourbon
without
any
real
bourbon
flavors
a
fun
beer
but
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
overall
a
very
nice
brew
for
12
a
little
different
than
what
i
was
expecting
but
decent
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
boulevard
bomber
and
i
loved
it
medium
to
dark
brown
in
color
unfiltered
with
a
1
inch
foamy
khaki
head
there
is
a
definite
mediumly
strong
aroma
of
sweet
bourbon
and
some
slight
rye
the
taste
is
great
again
the
sweet
bourbonyness
takes
the
forefront
but
there
is
some
pleasant
rye
undertones
that
are
pretty
solid
unfortunately
the
rye
flavor
subsides
after
the
first
few
drinks
this
beer
has
a
great
body
and
mouthfeel
as
well
moderately
low
carbonation
this
is
a
rich
sipper
for
sure
but
nothing
the
experienced
bourbonbeerbourbon
beer
drinker
cant
take
on
on
his
own

i
edited
this
description
throughout
drinking
it
as
the
beer
warmed
up
to
room
temp
and
it
got
much
better
so
dont
necessarily
need
to
refrigerate
the
2014
vintage
has
more
barrel
char
and
smokiness
in
the
nose
and
taste
and
a
touch
of
white
pepper
relative
to
my
memory
of
previous
ryeonrye
offerings
not
much
alcohol
heat
or
sweetness
as
the
high
abv
may
suggest
to
me
the
2013
ryeonrye
was
the
perfect
adult
candy
with
more
of
the
malty
sweet
and
vanilla
flavors
of
barrel
aging
2013
was
much
sweeter
im
not
sure
which
flavor
profile
i
like
better
this
beer
is
incredible
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
and
pretty
unique
offering
from
boulevard
not
many
people
are
dabbling
in
templeton
barrelaged
rye
beers
its
hard
to
compare
to
my
other
favorite
rye
beer
since
this
one
is
barrel
aged
and
the
other
one
is
far
more
aggressively
hopped
but
its
probably
safe
to
say
that
this
one
is
pretty
close
to
tied
for
best
in
style
in
my
mind
i
look
forward
to
its
annual
release
every
year
o
this
is
a
very
balanced
beer
of
course
the
rye
notes
dominate
the
taste
but
they
are
mellowed
out
nicely
by
caramel
malt
base
with
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
the
alcohol
content
while
apparent
is
wellhidden
its
a
great
sipper
while
curling
up
with
a
movie
on
saturday
night
that
being
said
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
to
me
as
remarkable
about
the
beer
its
a
great
inoffensive
big
beer
total
4550
o
extremely
complex
rye
beer
with
lots
of
layers
and
flavors
to
pick
out
a
nice
sipper
for
colder
nights
even
though
the
12
is
well
hidden
you
can
still
tell
that
its
a
big
beer
good
value
for
the
quality
this
one
was
enjoyed
while
reading
but
would
equally
do
well
as
a
cocktail
with
hors
doeuvres
overall
an
amazing
beer
from
boulevard
huge
recommendation
for
any
bba
fans
o
incredibly
delicious
and
offers
the
rye
whisky
flavour
and
smoky
wood
thats
soul
satifying
and
comforting
incredibly
bold
flavours
that
are
perfect
on
every
front
im
not
even
a
whisky
lover
but
this
might
change
my
mind
what
a
beer
just
plain
awesome
and
so
much
character
to
entertain
the
senses
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
rye
whiskey
notes
and
some
light
grainy
notes
taste
is
a
very
drinkable
mix
of
spicy
rye
malt
with
some
dry
rye
whiskey
notes
that
are
wellbalanced
and
rounded
with
a
dry
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
surprisingly
not
apparent
presence
of
alcohol
i
still
can
believe
how
easy
this
one
is
to
drink
wellbalanced
while
retaining
a
good
level
of
complexity
despite
the
premature
oxidation
that
has
taken
place
the
beer
was
still
pretty
nice
and
quite
drinkable
for
what
it
was
id
really
like
to
have
another
go
at
it
with
a
fresh
bottle
as
im
sure
it
stands
the
chance
to
be
even
better
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
was
executed
nicely
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
whiskey
and
dryness
this
beer
pours
a
wonderful
ruddy
brown
head
that
foams
and
foams
excellent
head

from
my
bottle
wow
you
can
smell
the
bourbon

rye
spiciness

the
flavor
is

the

by

and
dried
fruit
sweetness
faint
smokiness
and
a
lingering
oak
finish
only
beef
w
this
beer
was
the
cloying
thickness
of
it
but
overall
a
very
interesting
and
complex
beer
that
tastes
similar
to
an
old
ale
with
a
healthy
amount
of
rye
thrown
into
the
mix
witch
makes
this
a
beer
worthy
of
seeking
out
2012
edition
imagine
blonde
on
blonde
the
barrel
and
the
malty
sweetness
interpenetrating
each
other
beautifully
on

from

finally
got
to

would

do
this
could

the

that

i
like
this
idea
of
the
tasting
room
series
it
has
brought
us
some
great
beers
already
and
allows
some
of
the
more
raw
stuff
they
do
to
hit
our
lips
which
i
like
because
sometimes
boulevard
is
overly
polished
this
one
pours
somewhere
between
caramel
and
brown
with
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
other
than
that
mostly
clear
the
head
is
tan
and
frothy
but
shortish
lived
i
smells
a
weird
tang
which
the
label
says
comes
from
rye
but
to
me
its
almost
tannic
and
the
finish
of
the
beer
agrees
with
that
almost
off
but
the
middle
is
so
good
caramel
malt
and
chocolate
malt
light
and
the
rye
which
takes
on
more
of
a
dried
fruit
here
than
a
spice
again
the
tang
yeast
is
english
it
seems
doughy
and
hanging
around
in
the
finish
which
is
off
dry
well
made
no
doubt
but
definitely
in
need
of
some
tweaks
to
be
perfect
i
love
the
grain
flavor
think
its
awesome
but
maybe
the
sparge
temperature
or
something
is
a
little
too
warm
those
tannins
arent
amazing
in
the
finish
but
i
like
the
base
flavor
a
whole
lot
and
think
it
fits
the
fall
season
super
well
underrated
overall
i
think
3
755

a
decent
drinking
if
rather
unexciting
beer
the
rye
punch
comes
through
in
the
taste
primarily
yet
the
beer
on
whole
seems
rather
bland
and
watery
at
least
initially
the
smell
was
pretty
faint
and
hard
to
pickup
on
although
it
is
there
subsequent
sips
reveal
a
bit
more
depth
with
the
malt
base
and
rye
so
it
can
does
grow
on
you
with
a
30
rye
grain
bill
i
expected
a
bit
more
rye
oomph
as
warms
the
rye
shows
stronger
with
a
crackling
quality
which
is
fun
picked
this
up
as
part
of
mixed
12
pack
from
boulevard
oustanding
appearance
on
the
beer
thick
and
murky
looking
with
a
great
head
that
just
grabs
the
glass
as
it
dissipates
beautiful
not
much
to
offer
the
nose
but
very
tasty
good
but
not
great
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
and
would
have
no
problem
having
it
again
might
not
seek
it
out
but
would
gladly
snag
it
as
part
of
a
mixed
pack
again
pours
a
pretty
amber
brown
in
color
with
about
a
12
finger
offwhite
head
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
which
was
very
surprising
actually
the
aroma
isnt
too
heavy
and
is
of
some
grains
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
and
sharp
with
a
hint
of
rye
and
wheat
overall
it
is
different
and
isnt
bad
perfect
carbonation
the
taste
brings
out
a
better
rye
grain
character
than
the
nose
and
then
there
is
a
stronger
caramel
sweetness
that
kicks
in
and
a
fuller
bitterness
but
this
all
has
to
be
taken
it
consideration
with
the
bland
aroma
it
tastes
better
than
the
bland
aroma
suggests
but
does
that
make
it
better
not
especially
hohum
ok
pours
a
clear
brown
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
citrus
hops
hint
of
floral
hops
and
hint
of
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
rye
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
pale
malt
hops
hint
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
rye
overall
great
appearance
decent
body
but
lacking
in
aroma
and
complexity
overall
this
would
have
to
go
down
as
a
miss
for
me
the
malt
profile
should
be
ratcheted
up
a
few
notches
to
compliment
the
rye
used
for
a
rye
inspired
brew
this
misses
the
target
update
the
beer
did
sweeten
some
as
it
warmed
making
it
a
little
better
still
a
rye
pale
ale
in
my
book
just
sweeter
i
bumped
up
my
taste
25
and
my
overall
25
cheers
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
after
dinner
no
complaints
but
as
this
is
in
tasting
room
stage
it
might
change
so
i
might
make
another
review
i
could
drink
this
often
an
average
rye
that
seems
well
made
but
nothing
groundbreaking
you
could
session
this
though
overall
not
bad
for
the
price
but
i
wouldnt
have
if
not
in
the
mixed
12
ive
had
this
a
few
times
now
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
ale
but
its
a
good
beer
and
seems
to
be
a
good
beer
to
mix
with
food
since
this
is
in
the
tasting
room
stage
i
would
probably
not
release
this
as
a
permanent
option
if
i
had
the
choice
im
not
sure
what
theyll
do
but
this
wouldnt
be
something
id
buy
a
12
pack
of
one
of
those
kind
of
beers
that
2
or
3
is
good
not
something
i
could
drink
on
through
the
night
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
nothing
special
about
this
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazy
mahogany
with
a
tiny
tan
head
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
dark
bread
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
spicy
rye
then
some
dark
bread
then
a
bit
of
metal
followed
by
a
clean
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
overall
though
it
is
a
good
beer
there
are
a
few
downsides
here
and
there
but
the
final
product
is
nice
o
definately
drinkable
but
not
much
going
on
fairly
bland
was
really
hoping
for
more
o
decent
rye
beer
but
seemed
to
be
missing
something
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
rye
beer
good
toasty
malt
notes
with
a
nice
kick
of
rye
spice
overall
i
like
this
beer
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
just
buy
itself
but
for
a
sampler
i
was
happy
with
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
is
very
dry
pours
out
a
dark
maroon
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
twofingers
with
good
retention
smell
is
is
definitely
malty
with
caremal
sweet
dark
fruits
and
tiny
bit
of
hops
that
are
really
in
the
background
the
nose
is
fairly
well
balances
but
could
use
a
little
more
hop
profile
taste
is
sweet
caremal
and
everything
in
the
nose
nothing
really
spectacular
but
it
works
ok
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
thick
due
to
the
carbonation
for
the
style
but
nothing
great
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
looks
good
feels
good
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
significantly
lacking
it
just
comes
across
as
wanting
for
something
more
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
tan
head
smell
is
of
roast
candied
fruit
slight
hops
not
over
powering
slightly
sweet
with
some
sour
notes
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
malthop
balance
is
nice
not
usually
a
huge
rye
beer
fan
but
this
is
pretty
good
and
really
easy
to
drink
would
buy
a
sixer
if
made
available
overall
picked
up
a
single
to
try
i
used
to
have
a
lot
of
boulevard
when
i
lived
in
missouri
this
is
pretty
good
not
a
rye
bomb
but
a
balanced
pale
ale
with
a
moderate
rye
feel
to
it
prickly
carbonation
tangy
rye
graininess
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
sort
of
one
dimensional
but
it
has
some
distinctive
rye
flavor
to
it
overall
just
ok
overall
this
what
a
pretty
average
rye
beer
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
easy
to
drink
but
i
wax
expecting
spicy
notes
and
a
bit
more
hops
ruddy
amber
with
a
trace
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
caramel
light
pine
resin
taste
is
malty
with
biscuit
and
caramel
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
some
rye
spice
body
is
medium
light
overall
this
is
a
bit
muddied
in
flavor
the
carbonation
is
decent
but
really
nothing
worthwhile
here
oenjoyable
rye
beer
for
rye
lovers
overall
very
quaffable
but
lacks
dimension
o
i
liked
this
very
much
boulevard
to
me
has
always
made
good
beers
and
i
flat
out
love
some
of
their
offerings
but
this
kicks
it
up
a
bit
this
is
the
most
quality
brew
ive
had
from
them
the
flavors
blend
so
well
sweet
dry
bitter
and
the
rye
is
present
but
does
not
overtake
everything
the
best
rye
beer
ive
ever
had
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
really
nice
head
and
thick
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
pungent
earthy
roasted
caramel
accentuated
with
some
rye
bread
and
tea
leaf
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
the
westside
rye
is
a
unbelievable
rye
session
ale
i
would
drink
this
allnight
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
is
carries
rye
in
the
form
of
a
wet
corn
meal
the
taste
is
evenly
balanced
between
malt
and
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
session
ale
but
there
is
a
heinnystella
after
taste
but
overall
it
is
tasty
a
run
of
the
mill
rye
beer
nothing
to
see
here
a
warm
amberbrown
sticky
khaki
head
that
throws
some
nice
lace
peppery
spicy
rye
is
front
and
center
other
malt
derived
flavors
include
burnt
toast
toffee
and
biscuit
hops
are
mild
with
a
dirty
herbal
note
that
meshes
with
the
rustic
rye
overall
some
decent
flavors
going
on
but
it
seems
a
bit
diluted
and
even
watery
at
times
given
the
high
percentage
of
rye
it
just
needs
a
little
more
if
you
are
going
for
something
malt
driven
give
me
a
little
more
body
if
you
are
going
for
dryness
and
drinkability
give
me
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
hops
overall
a
good
offering
from
boulevard
this
beer
should
become
a
regular
in
their
lineup
dark
copper
brown
in
color
fingernail
thin
layer
of
foam
rests
upon
the
top
good
clarity
i
definitely
get
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
the
front
of
the
palate
is
definitely
the
rye
but
it
is
quickly
balanced
with
some
hop
flavor
pretty
straight
forward
but
a
pretty
good
brew
i
try
not
to
bust
the
balls
of
any
brewery
on
here
but
i
couldnt
bite
my
tongue
on
this
one
i
have
really
come
to
love
boulevards
smoke
stack
series
and
could
care
less
for
their
year
round
for
the
most
part
this
one
certainly
doesnt
belong
in
the
former
or
neither
hopefully
kinda
sad
that
the
variety
pack
came
with
three
of
these
o
i
love
rye
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
spicy
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
delicious
on
tap
at
the
brewery
tour
752013
to
be
released
in
upcoming
test
sampler
packs
locally
aimed
to
be
a
sessionable
rye
ale
very
pedestrian
as
far
as
a
unique
boulevard
offering
goes
very
clearly
a
boulevard
pale
ale
base
with
some
rye
notes
and
perhaps
a
touch
more
hops
in
the
process
the
rye
isnt
featured
prominently
enough
in
my
opinion
wouldnt
be
one
id
rate
highly
in
the
new
test
sampler
pack
initiative
o
this
was
nice
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
very
good
but
not
great
overall
i
recommend
this
beer
my
only
regret
is
not
buying
two
bottles
next
time
i
might
try
this
one
with
a
little
bit
of
the
bulleit
95
rye
whiskey
added
for
extra
fortification
and
ryeyishness
just
seems
a
little
to
smooth
for
my
beer
drinking
tastes
i
do
like
the
ryeish
taste
it
has
i
just
wish
it
were
more
pronounced
5
00
oi
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
style
and
received
this
as
a
gift
i
dont
like
the
style
enough
to
purchase
it
and
this
beer
didnt
change
my
mind
still
if
you
like
ipas
and
rye
beers
this
one
would
be
worth
trying
overall
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
at
least
trying
for
a
dollar
wouldnt
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
though
overall
3
75
probably
the
best
rye
beer
i
have
tasted
it
is
not
perfect
by
any
means
but
is
good
at
what
it
attempts
to
do
create
a
refreshing
seasonal
the
box
said
that
not
me
brew
sessionable
and
probably
great
with
food
there
is
no
hint
of
its
6
3
abv
a
sleeper
a
surprise
and
worth
purchasing
if
you
see
it
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
clean
with
lots
of
character
a
fair
little
rye
beer
that
goes
down
nicely
nothing
extraordinary
yet
has
enough
character
to
warrant
repeat
visits
nice
use
of
rye
not
overpowering
and
could
work
well
as
a
session
beer
if
it
werent
for
that
offputting
flavor
the
mild
fruity
yeast
added
a
nice
english
accent
this
didnt
go
down
that
smooth
enjoyable
rye
puns
second
only
to
hop
puns
when
it
comes
to
groaninducing
beer
names
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
rustycopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlytoasted
rye
bread
watery
sprite
light
grapefruit
peel
light
grass
and
a
few
tidbits
of
toffee
the
taste
holds
notes
of
funky
orange
zest
soggy
rye
bread
light
brown
sugar
earthy
greens
light
topsoil
grass
and
a
few
shavings
of
oak
the
greeny
hops
just
dont
meld
well
with
the
sweet
malts
and
spicy
rye
at
all
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickish
feel
overall
this
just
seems
like
something
of
a
confused
mess
clashing
flavors
and
all
not
a
fan
am
i
meh
nothing
unpleasant
but
also
quite
forgettable
overall
with
absolutely
no
hesitation
this
was
a
total
drain
pour
o
not
bad
at
all
a
good
session
ale
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
would
gladly
drink
many
more
had
this
on
tap
at
bridgeport
nice
heady
pour
which
kept
its
retention
decent
lacing
and
a
clear
copper
color
decent
caramel
and
malty
smell
and
the
mild
hops
kicked
in
after
1
taste
for
a
ryle
ale
this
holds
up
well
the
consistency
of
the
taste
is
alittle
dissapointing
i
found
ithis
beer
needed
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
overall
this
was
good
not
memorable
one
of
the
more
rye
heavy
rye
beers
out
there
i
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
it
pours
a
surprisingly
light
and
clear
color
new
penny
copper
is
my
closest
approximation
radiant
with
an
inch
of
lasting
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
spice
from
the
rye
but
there
is
a
good
dose
of
other
malts
in
here
some
caramel
notes
and
something
german
maybe
flavor
really
has
a
nice
rye
spice
to
it
peppery
and
intense
both
at
the
start
and
in
the
finish
i
like
the
hop
kick
at
the
end
and
there
is
a
fruity
element
too
maybe
a
touch
of
orange
peel
or
something
that
ties
the
whole
thing
together
quite
well
its
not
as
complex
as
some
other
rye
brews
but
it
has
a
clever
flavor
profile
that
was
just
spot
on
with
a
bowl
of
homemade
chili
the
feel
is
just
okay
its
creamy
and
well
carbonated
but
its
also
a
little
thin
more
body
would
put
this
beer
into
the
a
range
for
me
i
could
also
see
this
working
well
in
a
cask
situation
overall
another
solid
brew
from
bridgeport
this
is
one
i
will
definitely
be
buying
again
12oz

crystal

with
a

that
holds
great
retention
and
leaves
excellent
lacing

spicy

with

toasted

somewhat
metallic

finishes
dry
while
the

lingers
with
some
aspirin
thinner

astringency
takes
away
from
smoothness
overall
not
a
real
smooth
ride
but
decent
very
rough
around
the
edges
and
kind
of
acidic
at
times
there
are
much
better
rye
beers
out
there
aroma
made
up
of
sweet
toasted
malt
with
some
herbal
notes
mixed
in
as
well
appearance
is
dynamite
i
let
my
bottle
sit
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
half
hour
before
pouring
the
head
was
huge
and
billowy
white

for
minutes
on

body
is

with
a
reddish

hue
almost
champagne
like

continue

flavor
is
nicely
balanced
for
this
style
a
little
sweet
at
first
but
followed
up
with
a
herbal
bitter
dryness
rye
grain
is
there
but
i
dont
pretend
to
be
an
expert
at
identifying
different
herbs
and
grains
in
beer
if
it
wasnt
named
smooth

i
might
not
say

nice
drinkable

smooth

could
drink
this
year
round
nice
all
around
beer
o
not
bad
refreshing
a
little
hoppy

i
can
deal
almost
a

i
have

left
they
will
go

hard
to
mix
a
rye
with
fruity
american
hops
tend
to
cancel
one
another
however
this
one
had
a
nice
aromataste
overall
an
unexpected
winner
i
hope
they
continue
to
brew
overall
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
to
want
to
session
but
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
bitter
and
sweet
not
bad
while
definitely
not
a
roggenbier
it
has
a
nice
malt
emphasis
o
a
pretty
belowaverage
beer
that
has
a
good
feel
and
is
thankfully
not
offensive
but
just
bland
making
it
drinkable
and
an
alright
slot
filler
in
a
picksix
four
it
is
arcadias
barrelaged
program
barring
the
excellent
shipwreck
porter
seems
to
be
ok
but
i
havent
had
a
regular
beer
from
them
i
would
care
to
tongue
again
rye
is
a
terrible
thing
to
waste
drain
pour
though
rye
spiciness
is
evident
it
doesnt
overpower
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
that
ive
tried
and
worth
having
again
overall
i
found
myself
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
the
rye
was
handled
deftly
and
added
a
nice
angle
to
the
other
tones
overall
a
rather
easy
drinking
sweeter
and
more
moderate
rye
brew
a
nice
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
cool
looking
can
much
better
that
many
beers
are
now
in
can
more
convenient
that
said
lets
give
a
whirl
psst
goes
the
top
and
i
get
a
citrusy
hops
smell
pours
into
a
handy
glass
to
a
deep
yellow
with
a
very
largeandincharge
off
white
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
starts
with
a
great
heavy
mouthfeel
upfront
with
contrite
bitterness
of
hops
that
dominates
there
is
some
malt
in
the
background
but
this
brew
is
primarily
scotch
like
hops
with
a
thick
malt
base
not
complex
but
a
very
tasty
brew
for
the
hophead
i
think
the
beer
would
benefit
from
a
little
sweetness
its
drinkable
not
interesting
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
overall
a
really
interesting
and
different
take
on
the
style
rye
beers
seem
to
come
in
all
sorts
of
shapes
and
sizeson
one
end
of
the
spectrum
you
have
darker
richer
barrelaged
beauties
like
boulevards
seasonal
ryeonrye
or
you
have
awesomely
hoppy
takes
like
founders
reds
rye
then
there
is
this
onea
very
pale
and
aromatic
rye
beer
that
calls
to
mind
characteristics
of
belgian
witbiers
all
i
know
is
that
i
seem
to
like
them
in
all
their
various
forms
and
sky
high
rye
is
no
different
its
a
great
summertime
rye
beer
both
because
of
the
light
character
and
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
cans
theres
an
evident
hopbite
and
rye
zestiness
on
this
with
a
nice
filling
effervescence
that
tapers
into
a
bit
of
a
spicy
finish
anywhere
else
but
in
michigan
and
id
applaud
this
brew
feel
mediumlight
body
is
properly
carbonated
but
a
bit
harsh
overall
this
beer
left
me
a
little
confused
i
didnt
love
it
but
i
didnt
hate
it
and
i
thought
it
wasnt
that
true
to
style
with
the
farmhouse
yeast
aspect
and
the
floral
hops
covering
up
most
of
the
spicy
and
earthy
rye
flavors
that
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
not
overly
bitter
and
not
too
filling
but
the
flavor
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
because
it
just
left
me
feeling
confused
about
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
a
damn
good
looking
beer
with
some
really
nice
head
and
lacing
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
funky
farmhouse
aspect
it
was
bad
but
it
was
unwanted
in
this
beer
and
it
didnt
work
that
well
with
the
rye
flavors
i
would
buy
a
can
of
this
again
if
i
knew
it
was
fresh
im
wondering
if
i
got
an
off
can
or
they
changed
the
recipe
im
just
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
this
brew
and
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
as
it
is
all
in
all
im
still
confused
about
this
beer
i
generally
like
those
funky
farmhouse
flavors
but
it
just
felt
out
of
place
in
this
beer
and
it
didnt
work
as
well
with
the
other
flavors
as
it
does
in
most
farmhouse
ales
this
may
be
why
you
dont
hear
of
many
rye
farmhouse
beers
better
luck
next
time
arcadia
this
brew
just
left
me
puzzled
and
nothing
else
overall
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
arcadia
makes
some
pretty
good
though
not
spectacular
beers
and
i
was
a
bit
concerned
by
the
age
on
this
one
but
it
holds
up
very
well
looking
forward
to
trying
another
there
is
nothing
amazing
about
this
beer
i
find
myself
using
the
terms
mild
or
understated
when
trying
to
describe
it
a
very
inoffensive
beer
im
new
to
ryes
but
i
really
feel
like
theres
just
not
that
much
rye
here
to
distinguish
it
from
your
average
pale
ale
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
certainly
a
good
go
to
for
a
nice
cold
one
on
a
hot
summer
evening
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
full
head
which
lasted
and
laced
well
appearance
was
a
golden
straw
with
a
slight
cloudiness
aroma
was
fruity
and
sweet
with
some
floral
notes
nice
grain
taste
with
floral
notes
and
some
malt
and
hop
on
the
back
mouthfeel
was
creamy
with
a
dry
slightly
hop
aftertaste
this
is
my
first
truely
rye
beer
most
ryes
come
in
the
form
of
an
ipa
so
i
dont
know
what
im
drinking
i
know
this
put
some
rye
in
it
next
time
pours
a
golden
orange
amber
with
a
small
slowly
fading
white
head
aroma
and
taste
s
of
rye
grains
biscuit
malt
with
some
floral
citrus
bitter
hops
a
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
biscuit
malt
rye
grains
with
some
floral
citrus
hops
for
balance
overall
a
good
solid
brew

pick
this
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
rye
overall
not
horrible
but
nothing
interesting
or
overly
well
done
about
it
i
know
some
people
are
fans
of
arcadia
but
there
beers
just
dont
hit
it
for
me
my
crack
and
inverted
glug
almost
caused
an
overflow
of
the
glass
i
have
gotten
pretty
good
at
knowing
when
to
back
off
but
this
was
a
nearmiss
color
was
a
deepgold
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
not
only
did
i
end
up
with
two
fingers
of
foamy
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
but
it
looked
like
meringue
this
is
getting
to
be
like
beer
porn
just
beautiful
i
was
asked
during
beer
school
about
the
necessity
of
decanting
the
beer
and
my
response
was
along
the
lines
of
how
will
you
be
able
to
see
and
smell
the
beer
otherwise
the
lacing
that
began
to
appear
as
it
fell
was
magnificent
nose
had
that
pleasant
black
pepperiness
that
rye
imparts
and
now
my
mouth
was
watering
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
combined
bite
of
the
hops
with
the
rye
lit
into
my
poor
bruised
tongue
like
a
jackhammer
tearing
into
macadam
the
tears
that
began
to
roll
down
my
cheeks
were
of
joy
with
a
little
bit
of
pain
i
love
rye
beer
and
have
ever
since
sopor
turned
me
onto
some
of
his
homebrew
about
seven
years
ago
in
grand
rapids
michican
during
my
visit
speaking
of
lacing
and
jackhammers
that
was
what
it
was
going
to
take
to
remove
from
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
down
finish
was
smoooth
slightly
minty
still
peppery
and
i
felt
like
i
could
use
it
as
mouthwash
get
some
this
summer
put
it
in
a
cooler
take
it
to
the
beach
camping
wherever
and
you
can
thank
me
later
this
is
a
very
clear
transparent
yellow
color
gold
tints
that
carries
a
thin
white
head
pine
and
wood
smell
hops
i
didnt
get
a
grain
rye
scent
in
the
brew
but
it
did
show
up
later
in
the
taste
moderate
sweetness
balanced
with
a
strong
hop
bitterness
lots
of
fleshy
fruit
in
the
taste
lingering
bitter
hop
finish
and
a
firm
body
overall
not
a
bad
rye
ale
the
actual
aspect
is
quite
hidden
and
after
a
few
sips
it
really
starts
to
be
more
of
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
not
bad
overall
solid
beer
as
a
whole
would
drink
it
again
but
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
rye
pours
a
clear
yellowish
copper
with
good
carbonation
and
okay
head
smells
mostly
of
lemon
citrus
hops
with
an
underlying
spiciness
im
assuming
is
from
the
rye
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
straight
up
rye
aroma
but
i
think
it
adds
a
little
complexity
with
the
hop
notes
tastes
is
much
of
the
same
as
the
aroma
lots
of
citrus
hops
upfront
with
some
spiciness
decent
amount
of
bitterness
is
there
but
i
get
sort
of
a
long
pronounced
sweet
lemony
taste
would
prefer
a
tad
more
dryness
but
then
again
thats
how
i
personally
like
my
beers
a
great
summer
beer
pretty
easy
drinking
and
something
you
would
want
on
a
nice
warm
day
a
very
solid
beer
would
try
this
one
again
gets
big
points
just
on
the
head
alone
pours
a
gigantic
head
that
settles
to
an
incredible
frothy
peak
rich
amber
color
with
good
lacing
the
nose
is
complex
good
hop
kick
with
a
nice
rye
undertone
with
hints
of
citrus
nose
is
suggestive
of
taste
with
good
amount
of
hops
and
nice
bitterness
the
rye
is
certainly
there
which
i
like
and
makes
its
presence
known
towards
the
end
a
nice
lingering
coating
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
decent
warm
and
hazy
with
decent
carbonation
slight
milkiness
overall
very
good
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
rye
beers
poured
this
rye
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
produced
a
excellent
white
head
very
nice
retention
and
left
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
citric
and
piney
hops
and
spicy
rye
medium
bodied
there
was
a
nice
average
amount
of
spicy
rye
and
a
crisp
lemon
and
grapefruit
citric
flavor
not
over
the
top
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
very
spicy
on
the
heavier
side
of
being
medium
bodied
creamy
body
rye
flavor
throughout
malt
barely
comes
through
showcaseing
the
rye
and
a
spicy
herbal
hop
note
some
citrus
notse
as
well
oddly
a
lot
of
detectable
alcohol
im
not
a
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
actually
isnt
too
bad
still
a
little
too
much
rye
for
me
but
otherwise
pretty
decent
besides
the
overy
boozey
and
spicy
back
end
decent
rye
beer
though
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
most
upsetting
thing
about
it
was
the
aroma
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
didnt
really
care
for
the
hop
profile
it
was
giving
off
and
the
rye
was
surprisingly
muzzled
overall
not
a
bad
choice
but
there
are
many
others
in
this
department
id
reach
for
before
this
one
smell
and
tastefeel
rye
touches
of
some
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
of
the
rye
medium
carbonation
with
a
medium
feel
great
example
of
the
style
though
this
isnt
my
bag
i
like
a
rye
that
tastes
like
smitten
golden
rye
by
bells
still
this
is
one
id
have
again
especially
if
i
werent
four
beers
deep
beforehand
o
overall
a
good
dose
of
hops
with
only
subtle
rye
highlights
dry
finish
if
you
are
looking
for
something
in
terms
of
rye
presence
you
might
be
a
bit
let
down
this
seems
to
be
a
pale
ale
first
sublimented
with
a
minimal
rye
percentage
of
the
bill
dry
hops
are
nice
with
a
moderate
appeal
again
expect
more
of
a
pale
ale
going
in
and
youll
find
this
of
moderate
enjoyment
since
this
is
labeled
as
a
rye
beer
and
not
a
pale
ale
i
will
judge
and
rate
as
a
rye
but
consider
the
extra
influence
of
the
hops
overall
this
beer
kind
of
underwelmed
me
while
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
lacks
any
real
rye
character
that
i
look
for
in
my
rye
beers
comes
across
as
just
an
average
ipa
and
really
is
forgettable
in
the
scheme
of
good
hoppy
beers
these
days
d
pretty
solid
brew
like
i
said
wouldnt
hate
for
some
more
body
but
otherwise
i
dont
really
have
any
complaints
worth
trying
for
fans
of
rye
beers
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
but
balanced
american
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
rye
this
is
borderline
ipa
in
my
opinion
but
that
is
a
good
thing
nice
robust
hoppy
flavor
complemented
by
the
spicy
rye
very
nice
mouthfeel
went
down
fairly
smooth
with
some
lingering
electricity
in
my
mouth
not
the
best
taste
but
i
have
a
hard
time
disliking

beers

with

and

obvious

the
mouthfeel
keeps
all
mentioned
flavors
but
it
allows
a
tingling
spicy
sensation
to
come
through
and
it
sticks
around
even
minutes
after
the
beer
is
finished
overall
it
was
a
pretty
interesting
beer
although
not
something
that
i
would
prefer
the
spice
was
just
weird
and
it
kind
of
ruined
the
beer
for
me
the
alcohol
was
nearly
unnoticeable
as
well
making
this
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
during
a
summer
drinking
session
lots
of
ryes
may
be
rated
higher
than
this
but
few
are
as
accessible
as
this
one
this
is
worth
seeking
out
during
the
waning
warm
weather
months
for
sure
o

smells
a

mostly

is

light

consistent
with

very
i
think
it
would
hold
up
that
long
then
again
their
12th

brew
plus
some
crackery
and
bready
malt
i
would
have
guessed
ipa
tastes
of
some
pine
hv
this
was
one
hell
of
an
interesting
beer
really
unique
and
enjoyable
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
nose
brings
a
bunch
of
spicy
rye
and
a
bit
of
booze
the
taste
is
quite
zesty
and
really
gives
off
the
cocktail
vibe
feel
is
a
bit
dry
and
quite
a
bit
of
rye
is
noticeable
drinks
okay
and
it
is
well
executed
just
not
sure
that
i
really
like
it
all
that
much
the
finish
is
sweet
and
warming
with
a
smooth
silky
touch
ok
garrett
well
done
this
truly
is
a
beer
manhattan
it
was
very
satisfying
and
even
slightly
refreshing
one
of
my
favorite
pleasures
with
a
good
manhattan
is
a
big
robust
cigar
i
am
going
to
have
to
find
the
opportunity
to
try
that
with
the
manhattan
project
d
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
nonetheless
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
still
enjoyed
it
taste
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
light
bitterness
from
the
rye
no
real
percepable
hop
flavor
but
there
is
some
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
mothfeel
is
really
full
and
rich
very
nice
drinking
two
thumbs
up
its
kind
of
fruit
punchy
black
cherry
comes
through
crisp
yet
dry
like
better
than
a
blueberry
drink
has
a
lactic
tart
finish
d
it
feels
rather
strong
so
youre
going
to
have
to
sip
this
one
the
beer
is
very
unique
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
if
the
opportunity
arises
d
very
i
dont
know
how
much
alcohol
is
in
here
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night

a
strikingly
easy
beer

at

possibly
due
to
its
exquisite
uniqueness
brooklyn
has
nailed
this
one
though
im
hard
pressed
to
categorize
it
stylistically
paired
with
delicate
foods
and
great
conversation
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
0
of
the
time
this
works
100
of
time
it
is
very
drinkable
but
the
expectation
should
be
to
have
a
different
experience
than
even
the
traditional
rye
beers
this
beer
was
totally
not
what
i
expected
when
it
was
described
as
a
rye
beer
but
after
ordering
it
and
thinking
about
the
name
it
made
much
more
sense
it
was
in
reality
a
beer
cocktail
where
rye
beer
was
was
used
as
a
base
instead
of
whiskey
and
the
spices
and
cherry
were
brewed
into
the
beer
and
not
added
afterwards
this
was
great
and
i
would
definitely
order
it
again

not
your

its
a

revealed
everything

but
with
a
strikingly

also
a
thinner

than

given
the

but
it
worked
with
the

a
refreshing
brew

i
dont

that
i
can
sit
and

all

the
manhattan

is
meant
to
be
sipped
for
sure
i
would
say
the
cherry
was
a
bit
cloying
and
the
whiksey
a
little
overwhelming
but
not
bad
considering
sweet
malty

with

that
linger

being
a

pretty
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
i
can
see
why
its
popular
seek
it
out
while
you
can
an
interesting
brew
conceptually
and
in
the
delivery
well
done
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
very
approachable
a
ton
of
yeast
sediment
floating
around
in
the
glass
which
detracted
from
the
appearance
a
bit
but
not
enough
for
me
to
lose
track
of
what
brooklyn
was
going
for
malty
fruity
nose
that
reminds
me
vermouth
somehow
the
taste
balances
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
with
something
reminiscent
of
aromatic
bitters
the
rye
barrel
definitely
adds
a
nice
note
fullbodied
feel
in
terms
of
drinkability
one
was
enough
of
a
meal
for
me
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
goes
down
easily
alcohol
content
makes
it
something
to
consider
in
a
sessionable
beer
but
its
a
nice
after
dinner
treat
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nearly
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
does
bring
to
mind
a
manhattan
with
the
sweet
malt
smell
and
a
bit
of
fruit
at
the
back
the
malt
character
is
great
in
the
taste
backed
nicely
by
the
bourbon
aging
the
fruit
in
the
taste
isnt
as
noticable
but
still
nice
with
the
full
body
and
the
low
carbonation
it
makes
for
a
nice
full
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
really
nice
crystal
malt
and
rye
scent
along
with
some
spices
that
i
cant
figure
out
what
they
are
im
not
a
manhattan
drinker
so
im
not
familiar
with
the
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
malt
and
rye
flavor
its
spicey
with
a
touch
of
bourban
and
spice
its
a
unique
flavor
im
not
in
love
with
it
but
its
quite
drinkable
and
full
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
tastey
beer
its
something
id
probably
not
buy
again
but
what
the
hell
big
ups
to
brooklyn
for
this
delicious
treat
the
above
was
my
review
from
just
drinking
the
beer
after
reading
other
reviews
i
see
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
beer
that
tastes
like
a
mixed
drink
sorry
i
only
drink
beer
or
wine
not
alcohol
and
reacted
accordingly
this
needs
to
be
served
with
a
disclaimer
to
warn
beer
lovers
drinkability
a
fascinating
beer
though
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
this
really
shows
of
the
skill
of
the
boys
from
brooklyn
to
create
a
faux
cocktail
using
barley
malt
and
rye
wow
pours
a
nice
rich
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
minimal
head
on
this
one
smell
is
a
crazy
combination
of
carrot
cake
bready
brown
sugar
sweet
cream
vanilla
nutty
slight
spicing
and
banana
booze
comes
through
as
it
warms
taste
is
banana
forward
with
the
carrot
cake
thing
going
on
in
the
background
again
bready
brown
sugar
sweet
vanilla
nuts
slight
spicing
the
background
give
hints
of
wood
dark
cherry
slightly
boozy
and
after
garrett
oliver
mentioned
it
i
did
notice
there
is
a
true
manhattan
cocktail
like
charachter
to
it
full
bodied
without
being
syrupy
or
sticky
an
excellent
original
and
complex
beer
had
2
glasses
and
still
want
more
overall
too
fruity
just
weird
tasting
i
would
not
have
guessed
if
i
didnt
already
know
that
this
was
a
rye
ale
entirely
too
much
going
on
here
and
the
flavors
seem
to
compete
against
one
another
instead
of
complimenting
each
other
although
i
admire
the
creativity
behind
the
manhattan
project
i
fear
that
what
makes
most
of
brooklyns
offerings
great
simplicity
got
lost
in
this
one
not
sure
if
the
rye
beer
classification
fits
either
as
manhattan
project
struck
me
more
as
a
herbedspiced
beer
with
rye
added
an
ambitious
swing
by
brooklyn
but
it
narrowly
misses
the
mark
pours
good
and
brown
with
a
very
thin
head
smells
of
rye
and
sour
cherries
tastes
well
like
a
manhattan
not
bitter
at
all
with
very
nice
blend
of
rye
malt
and
cherries
and
a
bit
of
an
alcoholic
bite
little
carbonation
but
a
good
velvety
texture
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
like
a
manhattan
lite
but
with
carbonation
and
less
booze
real
good
d
moderate
id
have
another
one
although
not
backtoback
this
is
a
special
beer
a
unique
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
really
different
from
anything
ive
had
before
drinkability
this
beer
was
unique
and
somewhat
complex
it
is
a
slow
sipping
beer
but
i
had
two
glasses
of
this
while
at
the
bar
and
probably
could
have
had
another
worth
seeking
this
one
out
drinkable
yes
if
it
were
not
for
the
amazing
tap
selection
on
hand
i
would
have
had
a
few
of
these
good
stuff

and

a

pa
for

served
in
a
tall
goblet
the
beer
appears
orange
with
a
soft
white
head
most
rye
beers
get
a
generous
helping
of
hops
but
this
beer
focuses
on
the
rye
malt
and
spices
my
first
thoughts
were
that
it
tasted
like
a
sweet
rye
cake
in
part
thanks
to
the
light
cinnamon
and
dessert
spices
added
i
didnt
detect
the
barrel
aging
but
still
found
this
to
be
a
tasty
and
smooth
strong
ale
manhattan
has
a
rusty
brown
look
with
some
slight
red
highlights
up
towards
the
light
a
nice
tan
head
that
dwindled
down
and
leaves
loose
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
brings
up
rye
along
with
some
spices
nutmeg
and
vanilla
i
also
got
some
light
pumpkin
like
flavors
making
me
wonder
if
i
got
the
right
beer
the
taste
brings
more
malt
than
the
nose
leads
caramel
sweetness
the
rye
is
there
but
not
there
a
nice
spice
backing
with
a
slight
hop
bite
fruits
such
as
cherry
in
the
mix
i
think
there
is
a
bit
to
much
going
on
here
the
feel
is
medium
with
ample
carb
but
this
project
leaves
a
funny
taste
in
my
mouth
afterwards
a
little
spiciness
in
the
middle
with
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
minimal
im
glad
i
tried
this
project
not
my
favorite
rye
beer
as
i
think
its
trying
to
be
a
bit
more
a
great
idea
from
brooklyn
this
is
kind
of
different
overall
for
the
price
i
paid
this
was
quite
the
investment
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
am
glad
to
have
finally
tried
another
great
brew
by
brooklyn
d
interesting
take
on
a
rye
beer
although
this
is
quite
thick
and
syrupy
i
think
the
subtle
tartness
of
the
cherries
works
well
with
the
rye
character
im
not
completely
sold
on
this
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
pretty
tasty
nonetheless
d
good
i
put
down
the
bomber
all
by
myself
that
being
said
22
ounces
is
probably
enough
but
this
is
one
unique
sweet
treat
overall
pretty
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
very
happy
i
tried
it
it
was
very
interesting
beer
that
i
would
certainly
seek
out
again
this
is
an
extremely
original
beer
from
brooklyn
and
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
the
mixture
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries
with
the
spices
and
rye
really
seem
to
come
together
well
drinkability
i
overall
did
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
and
was
lucky
enough
to
try
two
of
them
on
tap
but
they
are
certainly
a
very
sweet
desert
beer
in
a
way
hard
to
drink
alot
of
this
just
because
so
sweet
but
it
was
very
interesting
unique
style
of
beer
that
i
would
certainly
seek
out
again
myself
and
the
group
of
guys
i
was
with
did
overall
enjoy
this
beer
overall
d
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
overall
insanely
good
really
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
brew
nb
i
capped
my
growler
on
foam
so
i
doubt
there
was
any
oxidation
on
the
tasting
pint
there
was
surely
a
loss
of
carbonation
however
so
take
the
review
with
a
grain
in
regards
to
that
i
really
dont
think
this
beer
was
much
of
a
success
i
liked
the
concept
but
it
just
didnt
work
very
well
it
was
overly
sweet
much
too
sweet
with
the
cherry
flavor
dominating
and
reminding
me
of
maraschino
the
bourbon
quality
was
stronger
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
and
its
not
often
i
say
this
because
i
think
bourbon
is
more
often
than
not
overdone
but
this
really
could
have
used
more
bourbon
character
it
also
really
needed
some
balance
in
the
form
of
spice
or
bitterness
which
is
why
the
lack
of
rye
spiciness
was
so
sorely
missed
maybe
they
should
have
used
a
noble
hop
to
complement
and
bring
out
the
rye
spice
regardless
it
didnt
come
through
and
it
really
needed
to
more
bourbon
or
more
rye
character
any
rye
character
would
have
helped
cut
the
sweetness
and
balance
this
out
a
bit
maybe
with
some
tweaking
they
can
make
this
one
work
but
as
of
right
now
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
more
has
potential
but
not
a
great
beer
right
now
presented
in
a
snifter
holds
a
decent
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
thick
and
sticky
lacing
smells
initially
very
spicy
with
herbal
undercurrents
and
touches
of
whiskey
tastes
very
much
like
the
manhattan
it
was
modeled
after
the
rye
is
prominent
but
not
overpowering
some
caramel
and
toffee
malt
flavors
tart
red
fruit
and
an
even
bitterness
from
the
gentian
root
very
full
mouthfeel
with
a
slick
texture
comes
off
well
balanced
maybe
just
slightly
heavy
but
thats
not
really
a
bad
thing
is
it
served
in
a
tulip
glass
at
leons
genuinely
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
note
that
i
am
indeed
a
big
fan
of
the
manhattan
the
ryesweet
vermouthbitters
concoction
and
that
i
had
this
beer
after
enjoying
leons
version
of
the
manhattan
but
i
cant
imagine
a
richer
malty
approximation
of
the
manhattan
and
even
though
this
is
a
rye
beer
it
stands
up
to
the
taste
of
the
great
sweet
stouts
i
e
flying
dog
gonzo
imperial
porter
not
sure
how
they
pulled
it
off
but
this
one
is
fine
fine
fine
too
bad
i
cant
take

on

at

flavor
reminded
me
more
of
a
bland
winter
warmer
beer
i
just
dont
get
what
brooklyn
was
trying
to
do
with
this
brew
they
took
a
nice
shot
but
i
think
it
missed
the
mark
overall
this
was
a
very
well
done
beer
thats
greatest
achievement
was
intensity
with
subtlety
a
number
of
bright
and
identifiable
flavors
cooperating
very
nicely
well
worth
a
shot
was
glad
to
happen
upon
this
beer
at
leons
after
a
belgian
dinner
at
the
brick
store
what
a
nice
desert
served
in
a
brooklyn
stemmed
glass
the
beer
has
a
deep
brown
hue
with
a
slight
ruby
hint
around
the
edges
where
light
brightens
the
beer
a
white
one
finger
head
rests
atop
and
thankfully
stuck
around
for
a
while
as
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
sipper
aroma
is
a
mix
of
alcohol
rye
and
a
hint
of
cherry
but
not
very
potent
in
any
of
these
characteristics
drinking
this
beer
i
had
mixed
feelings
on
one
side
i
have
to
give
it
credit
for
accomplishing
the
essence
of
a
manhattan
in
beer
form
i
am
not
much
of
liquor
drinker
but
this
happens
to
be
the
one
drink
i
order
the
botanicals
and
rye
whiskey
barrel
aging
have
given
the
beer
the
necessary
hints
that
vermouth
adds
the
mixed
drink
the
rye
itself
is
not
as
strong
as
i
had
anticipated
and
is
a
bit
overtaken
by
the
alcohol
and
cherry
flavor
this
is
the
other
side
i
felt
the
cherry
presence
was
just
too
intense
it
added
a
syrupy
sweetness
that
was
a
bit
much
for
me
in
the
end
an
amazing
blend
of
flavors
but
maybe
a
bit
much
of
the
one
despite
the
abv
and
mix
of
contents
the
beer
itself
is
rather
thin
and
light
in
mouthfeel
however
the
intense
flavors
and
maybe
its
youthful
boozy
character
make
it
a
sipper
for
sure
i
enjoyed
this
as
a
night
cap
just
like
the
drink
and
would
suggest
others
do
the
same
with
this
beers
big
complex
flavor
ontap
at
coles
this
black
but
yeasty
beer
had
a
white
caesar
head
stout
in
aroma
and
white
lace
followed
rich
and
chocolate
in
finish
with
median
mouthfeel
the
herbs
and
rye
gave
this
a
sweet
and
spicy
taste
profile
alcohol
hidden
this
was
a
unique
one
drinkability
a
very
interesting
aromatic
and
herbal
and
fruity
tasting
beer
never
had
a
proper
manhattan
but
now
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
i
would
like
to
sample
this
again
as
it
really
is
something
special
and
different
i
think
a
few
of
these
is
in
need
to
really
sort
out
all
the
nuances
in
the
beer
if
they
have
this
at
your
local
pub
by
all
means
get
one
or
two
maybe
three
just
keep
in
mind
its
8
5
abv
an
interesting
beer
but
i
cannot
imagine
ever
having
more
then
one
small
glass
of
it
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
drinkability
here
is
decent
since
the
rye
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
however
i
found
this
brew
to
be
underwhelming
and
was
glad
that
this
was
a
sample
d
this
beer
is
actually
very
cocktaillike
if
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
then
i
feel
they
nailed
it
you
could
easily
fool
someone
with
this
one
now
when
you
tell
me
it
is
a
beer
a
rye
beer
i
am
expecting
something
else
great
creativity
and
good
execution
but
not
my
favorite
beer
im
rating
this
beer
as
exceptionally
drinkable
not
for
the
fact
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
beers
that
could
be
sessionable
but
instead
it
crosses
a
spectrum
that
other
beers
dont
a
very
creative
idea
i
wonder
what
a
splash
of
bourbon
would
do
to
this
beer
overall
this
was
pretty
damn
solid
i
have
to
admit
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
way
it
held
its
own
and
is
definitely
a
unique
offering
would
do
this
one
again
notes
i
feel
honored
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
and
did
the
beer
very
enjoyable
and
its
8
5
abv
caught
me
off
guard
it
was
well
balanced
albeit
a
bit
sweet
but
not
so
much
that
it
took
away
from
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
d
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
months
and
it
did
not
disappoint
totally
an
extreme
beer
in
every
sense
a
really
nice
beer
all
around
i
will
probably
be
able
to
try
this
on
tap
this
week
and
i
cannot
wait
get
this
while
you
can
this
beer
was
a
sugary
sweet
mess
it
seemed
like
the
brewers
forgot
to
add
the
hops
to
the
brew
kettle
an
interesting
project
for
sure
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
i
cant
really
say
whether
or
not
its
a
good
representation
of
the
rye
beer
style
since
its
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
in
the
style
but
it
does
make
very
good
use
of
the
rye
malts
and
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
like
a
previous
reviewer
said
this
is
a
beer
that
has
been
made
to
taste
like
a
sweet
manhattan
i
like
bourbon
and
i
dont
drink
manhattans
but
i
know
one
when
i
taste
one
and
this
efffing
beer
tastes
like
a
better
manhattan
i
give
it
a
4
5
and
recommend
getting
it
at
rootstock
on
draft
with
all
the
greatness
the
place
as
to
offer
definitely
pushes
the
envelope
of
what
beer
is
ill
lift
my
glass
heres
to
you
mr
oliver
jesus
loves
you
more
than
you
will
know
oh
wo
wo
wo
amazing
this
is
original
in
all
of
the
world
of
beer
i
find
it
closest
to
a
kind
of
oud
bruin
with
herbs
added
but
who
knows
all
i
know
is
that
i
paid
10
for
a
small
glass
10
oz
at
the
cafe
dalsace
manhattan
and
i
was
glad
to
have
it
id
have
enjoyed
another
at
that
price
without
question
had
i
not
had
to
move
on
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
just
for
its
uniqueness
brilliant
after
having
another
taste
of
this
beer
it
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
i
am
not
a
big
liquor
drinker
but
i
do
enjoy
thr
occasional
manhattan
i
really
enjoy
the
vermouth
characteristics
in
the
beer
it
also
gets
way
better
as
it
warms
up
still
not
the
most
aromatic
beer
but
its
uniqueness
is
great
and
shows
the
limitless
potential
of
beer
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
pours
a
pretty
dark
redpurple
color
with
a
soapy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
nothingness
flat
the
aroma
is
nothing
crazy
peppery
spicy
from
the
rye
the
taste
is
peppery
with
rye
spicesour
flavor
there
is
a
nice
berry
flavor
towards
the
end
perhaps
cherry
or
raspberry
a
solid
malt
body
supports
the
spicy
and
fruit
flavors
despite
the
flat
look
the
brew
has
decent
carbonation
with
a
light
to
moderate
body
well
balanced
a
very
tasty
brew
nice
combination
of
spicyzest
and
fruit

a

up
beer
from
a
grown
up
brewery
d
refreshing
abv
is
hidden
well
had
another
one
and
now
ive
learned
that
its
not
just
a
rye
ale
either
its
a
rye
ale
infused
with
the
other
flavors
that
go
into
the
drink
manhattan
bitters
cherry
etc
not
bad
but
not
too
often
for
me
d
ill
start
off
by
saying
i
love
the
experimentation
with
themes
i
may
have
been
my
own
worst
enemy
in
as
much
that
i
was
reallly
looking
forward
to
the
ryerye
combo
inspired
by
some
fancy
mixologist
guy
i
get
more
of
a
maraschino
cherry
flavor
than
anyting
else
it
is
it
supposed
to
be
manhattan
project
as
in
like
the
drink
manhattan
right
i
just
wish
it
had
some
rye
beer
flavor
i
didnt
get
any
of
that
bummer
cool
idea
though
and
a
cool
beer
an
interesting
attempt
at
replicating
a
cocktail
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
www
theviceblog
com
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
red
ale
rye
notes
as
expected
a
little
spiciness
but
nothing
overly
memorable
overall
an
interesting
brew
nicely
balanced
and
goes
well
with
food
however
it
didnt
make
a
very
strong
impression
i
thought
of
it
very
much
as
a
rye
epa
besides
the
rye
it
seemed
very
similar
to
summits
standard
pale
ale
overall
its
a
little
different
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
it
is
a
little
offputting
a
bit
dark
and
garbagey
the
malts
are
a
tad
on
the
rotten
side
and
the
hop
is
pretty
intense
meh
summits
frost
line
delivers
a
rich
darkly
caramelish
and
malty
ale
with
a
fairly
distinct
note
of
spicy
rye
and
some
gently
citrusy
hops
in
the
background
its
not
particularly
strong
as
a
winter
ale
at
just
5
8
abv
but
it
also
follows
on
the
heels
of
their
standard
winter
ale
at
a
slightly
more
respectable
6
2
so
that
kind
of
makes
sense
and
its
fullflavored
and
satisfying
enough
that
its
name
shouldnt
need
to
be
questioned
once
tasted
a
solid
bitterness
backs
it
to
the
point
that
its
bitter
and
dry
while
still
allowing
the
malt
to
stand
out
with
just
an
edge
of
sweetness
which
is
blanketed
by
a
light
cloak
of
floral
and
mildly
citrusy
hops
and
then
ultimately
balanced
and
livened
by
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
nicely
done
dark
amber
1
inch
slightly
offwhite
head
dissipates
fairly
slowly
with
some
lacing
odor
is
very
good
a
bit
grassy
with
subtle
spice
relatively
highly
carbonated
bitter
hoppy
initial
taste
and
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
quite
a
bitter
beer
a
spicy
bitter
but
still
bitter
substantial
mouth
feel
with
a
difficult
to
describe
malt
foundation
behind
the
spicy
bitterness
wellbalanced
and
also
inbetweenstyles
delicious
and
frighteningly
drinkable
a
very
surprising
beer
a
pleasant
suprise
from
mn
had
on
tap
pours
brilliant
brown
with
a
spicy
nose
with
a
touch
of
roast
the
palate
is
creamy
with
light
roast
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
spicy
rye
flavors
medium
body
and
carbonation
tasty
and
drinkable
i
cant
believe
i
didnt
try
this
when
it
came
out
last
winter
or
spring
or
inbetweenseasons
as
summit
calls
it
very
wellbalanced
and
also
inbetweenstyles
but
delicious
and
frighteningly
drinkable
worth
a
shot
clear
with
a
deep
amber
cooler
nice
frothy
persistent
white
head
light
english
hop
aroma
with
carmel
and
chocolate
malt
aromas
flavor
profile
similar
to
a
english
brown
with
rye
on
the
clean
finish
good
brown
ale
with
a
hint
of
rye
like
all
summit
beers
it
is
worth
a
try
overall
didnt
match
my
memory
from
last
year
which
i
remembered
being
more
spicy
and
hoppy
even
so
this
was
enjoyable
and
ill
drink
it
more
than
once
i
love
rye
and
a
lot
of
the
better
rye
beers
out
there
seem
to
bring
a
certain
amount
of
citrus
into
the
mix
which
im
fine
with
this
one
doesnt
though
and
it
doesnt
need
to
it
is
solid
as
is
thinking
about
rye
beers
makes
me
miss
schells
emerald
rye
though
o
this
beer
doesnt
seem
nearly
as
spicy
as
other
rye
beers
but
there
is
a
nice
contrast
between
the
different
type
of
malts
that
are
used
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
a
good
spicy
rye
pleasant
throughout
o
excellent
rye
which
should
be
no
surprise
summit
does
an
excellent
job
on
style
representation
through
their
whole
line
this
beer
is
not
an
exception
great
aroma
very
balanced
in
flavor
o
a
very
flavorful
and
delicious
rye
beer
tastes
like
a
rye
pale
ale
or
ipa
very
clean
and
delicious
but
not
overbearing
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
night
thanks
again
matthew
this
would
make
for
a
solid
session
ale
but
i
think
that
a
fall
release
would
be
more
appropriate
than
a
winter
release
overall
a
really
dry
beer
clean
on
the
palate
d
a
tasty
little
seasonal
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
the
rye
is
fairly
mellow
to
me
but
complimented
well
by
the
other
components
of
citrusy
hops
and
coffeechocolate
roast
malts
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
winter
brown
ale
for
sure
if
you
like
rye
beers
i
certainly
recommend
this
one
overall
a
rather
nice
easy
drinking
rye
overall
while
not
top
class
it
is
more
moderate
in
abv
then
most
ryes
and
is
rather
affordable
a
decent
go
to
rye
o
in
hindsight
i
should
have
reviewed
this
beer
a
few
months
back
when
it
was
fresher
i
remember
liking
it
a
lost
more
a
month
or
two
ago
will
have
to
try
it
again
next
year

slight

the

and
a
bitterness
of
the
aforementioned
hop
smothered
over
a
crackers
and
biscuits
backbone
medium
to
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
presents
interesting
elements
that
i
can
enjoy
but
altogether
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
o
easy
drinking
rye
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
its
good
i
do
enjoy
its
a
good
beer
and
i
can
drink
it
very
sessionable
very
warm
peppery
and
tasty
indeed
its
a
fine
inbetweener
not
quite
this
more
than
that
it
also
dances
around
style
designations
in
an
admirable
way
i
like
it
nice
for
something
different
like
it
but
dont
love
it
but
no
one
should
be
complaining
about
not
being
able
to
taste
the
rye
in
this
beer
i
see
one
more
6pack
in
my
future
deep
brassy
hue
clear
with
a
good
sudsy
lacing
full
on
rye
jacket
is
toasty
and
spicy
throughout
just
enough
hop
bitterness
with
some
floral
and
soft
citrusy
flavor
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
had
a
bear
republic
hop
rod
rye
ba
100
last
week
and
this
beer
is
in
that
same
class
hoppy
refreshing
and
overall
very
satisfying
i
had
a
pint
with
dinner
and
stopped
at
the
beer
store
to
pick
up
a
6pack
on
the
way
home
and
they
did
not
have
it
so
i
picked
up
a
sierra
nevada
ruthless
rye
it
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
summit
frost
line
the
previous
unchained
rye
had
over
the
top
rye
flavor
and
it
was
almost
undrinkable
this
version
is
awesome
great
work
summit
pretty
easy
to
drink
nothing
mindblowing
here
hell
id
probably
prefer
this
in
the
warmer
months
makes
me
think
poormans
reds
rye
substitute
jesus
this
is
awesome
it
is
perfectly
hoppy
a
great
balance
of
hop
aroma
flavor
and
balanced
bitterness
and
just
aggressive
enough
with
the
rye
to
cut
through
the
hops
masterfully
balanced
not
too
hoppy
not
too
malty
i
highly
recommend
this
overall
a
new
seasonal
from
summit
definitely
whacks
you
over
the
head
with
rye
flavor
big
rye
bread
all
over
the
place
fits
in
pretty
well
with
the
season
easing
out
of
winter
with
a
different
kind
of
spiciness
than
the
winter
ale
very
bitter
almost
to
its
detriment
assuming
this
is
a
spring
seasonal
and
it
is
fitting
do
good
sessionable
beer
here
ive
always
enjoyed
summit
beers
for
what
they
are
good
wholesome
drinkable
beers
o
this
is
a
rye
beer
pure
and
simple
and
well
done
overall
certainly
not
as
good
as
the
old
india
rye
ale
from
the
unchained
series
this
one
isnt
as
ipa
like
but
still
a
solid
addition
to
summits
lineup
and
also
a
nice
lower
abv
choice
for
the
depressing
late
winter
months
o
ryepa
is
a
common
beer
name
going
around
but
frost
line
rye
is
neither
play
on
words
nor
a
hoppy
style
this
is
a
downndirty
rye
beer
smooth
in
body
but
harsh
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
relentless
rye
character
that
brings
spice
throughout
and
doesnt
hold
back
a
nicely
balanced
beer
though
it
drinks
wonderfully
for
the
few
cold
months
we
have
left
ahead
of
us
overall
a
really
good
new
rye
beer
from
summit
really
nice
rye
spice
presence
with
some
good
subtle
notes
of
fruit
and
chocolate
all
in
all
a
quality
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
well
done
it
has
been
four
years
since
the
india
rye
ale
so
i
cannot
make
a
direct
comparison
this
one
just
does
not
impress
me
as
much
maybe
the
way
the
brewer
used
the
summit
hops
in
this
beer
did
not
suit
my
tastes
still
a
lot
of
impressive
rye
flavor
to
be
had
pours
deep
copperish
red
color
with
a
1
inch
off
white
head
the
smell
has
strong
spicy
notes
of
rye
and
some
mild
hops
and
maltiness
but
then
also
has
a
sort
of
off
putting
aroma
that
i
cant
place
like
earthy
smokey
odd
i
hope
that
doesnt
come
out
in
the
flavor
ooooh
this
is
great
the
rye
is
definitely
in
the
fore
front
of
this
one
very
much
balanced
out
with
the
hops
and
malt
has
a
good
mouth
feel
medium
carbonation
and
pleasant
but
somewhat
strong
after
taste
good
job
summit
i
wished
they
released
beers
like
this
more
often
too
bad
its
only
seasonal
and
not
new
to
the
line
up
best
summit
beer
released
since
saga
this
one
is
a
major
winner
in
my
book
at
the
price
point
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
on
the
market
that
has
this
much
character
im
going
to
be
drinking
the
heck
out
of
this
i
do
love
my
rye
just
not
in
beer
or
maybe
this
needed
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
flavors
this
is
quality
stuff
for
the
price
and
availability
i
was
craving
a
rye
ale
and
this
one
hit
the
spot
for
the
most
part
it
has
the
rye
spiciness
that
i
was
looking
for
without
any
extra
sweetness
i
sometimes
think
that
an
extra
hop
kick
could
make
it
even
better
but
overall
its
a
good
and
sessionable
rye
beer
love
all
the
beers
from
this
brewery
have
not
had
a
bad
tasting
beer
yet
finally
got
to
try
this
one
and
was
very
surprised
how
good
it
was
out
of
the
12oz
releases
from
the
speakeasy
brewery
this
might
be
my
favorite
give
this
beer
and
any
other
beer
from
this
brewery
a
try
if
youre
ever
in
the
san
francisco
area
this
is
a
really
cool
brewery
to
visit
excellent
vibe
and
friends
service
taste
is
nice
lightly
sweet
juiciness
with
very
light
balancing
bitterness
with
leafy
citrus
hints
of
toasty
bread
finish
of
earth
and
light
spicy
rye
bread
its
very
drinkable
smooth
and
a
nice
flavor
a
good
taste
not
hoppy
o
quite
impressive
though
i
would
expect
no
less
from
speakeasy
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
brews
in
this
category
but
i
imagine
this
will
satisfy
any
maltforward
toasty
and
drinkable
beer
cravings
you
might
have
cheers
the
bitterness
subsides
after
a
few
sips
and
mostly
a
rye
malty
taste
stays
through
to
the
finish
enjoyable
brew
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
could
have
a
more
intense
aroma
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
even
sessionable
o
a
good
rye
beer
slightly
uncommon
for
me
but
i
liked
it
o
not
bad
its
not
a
favorite
in
the
rye
world
a
well
made
beer
but
not
my
palate
here
there
is
too
much
malty
sweetness
in
this
one
for
the
rye
to
really
have
much
of
its
usual
spice
impact
and
instead
we
are
left
with
a
rather
heavy
red
amber
beer
without
a
ton
of
flavor
looks
nice
though
clear
dark
copper
in
color
with
over
an
inch
of
tan
head
it
smells
grainy
and
sweet
and
the
taste
matches
i
dont
get
much
hops
at
all
from
either
and
the
rye
is
just
way
too
subtle
for
me
but
admittedly
i
like
to
taste
rye
when
its
in
the
grain
bill
lots
of
body
lots
of
residual
sugar
it
could
use
some
bottle
conditioning
or
something
to
clean
it
up
a
bit
but
its
well
carbonated
and
suitable
for
cooler
early
spring
days
probably
the
least
impressive
speakeasy
brew
i
have
had
to
date
but
still
far
from
a
poor
showing
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
that
i
particularly
like
but
it
was
interesting
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
great
but
ultimately
fell
short
of
my
expectations
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
very
unique
flavors
and
well
crafted
i
like
what
ive
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
look
forward
to
venturing
more
of
their
stuff
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
but
really
didnt
notice
any
rye
12oz
bottle
from
a
friend
who
warned
me
that
this
was
awful
he
was
not
kidding
looked
fine
amber
good
head
smelled
like
the
most
awful
malts
flavor
was
dirty
and
like
soggy
stale
cereal
this
was
a
really
bad
beer
not
sure
what
happened
with
this
one
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
akashicbooks

a
nice

that
is

light
on
the
rye
but
fairly
well
balanced
lots
of
flavor
for
its
abv
overall
pretty
much
just
average
not
horrible
just
has
some
weird
offtastes
that
arent
bad
but
just
dont
fit
youre
not
missing
much
if
you
dont
try
it
thats
for
sure
solid
choice
with
robust
roasted
vegetables
tougher
and
less
flavorful
meats
the
scarlett
pours
as
beautiful
as
the
girl
on
the
label
the
beer
was
a
deep
rich
clear
amber
with
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lace
the
scent
was
very
malty
the
taste
was
ok
started
very
nice
then
a
weird
stringent
funk
piled
on
leaving
me
to
scratch
my
head
does
not
come
off
the
pallet
as
nice
as
other
ryes
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
ok
not
sure
id
run
out
to
buy
it
an
enjoyable
red
rye
ale
poured
a
reddish
brown
and
had
nice
head
retention
and
lace
a
rather
light
nondescript
aroma
for
a
rye
beer
as
i
get
a
little
bit
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
along
with
citric
hops
and
rye
but
nothing
really
going
on
here
and
its
a
little
odd
smooth
easy
to
drink
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
but
it
just
seems
to
misfire
the
rye
gives
it
a
little
dryness
and
heartyness
and
the
sweet
malts
and
hops
are
in
there
and
balanced
but
as
i
finished
my
glass
it
was
more
grainy
and
harsh
than
anything
resembling
sweetness
or
hoppiness
a
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
greats
pours
crimson
reddish
brown
with
virtually
no
foam
on
top
just
a
smattering
of
white
toffee
rye
nose
subtle
sweetness
pleasing
rich
malty
taste
with
a
rye
hop
bitter
in
the
middle
that
rolls
into
sweet
finish
nice
bite
solid
mouthfeel
everything
really
works
together
for
a
tasty
end
result
the
flavor
is
on
the
mild
side
with
an
odd
sweet
sensation
sort
of
grainy
with
an
interesting
resiny
tang
that
may
be
the
rye
otherwise
not
much
sense
of
the
often
spicy
and
dry
ryeness
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
though
there
is
a
pleasant
bitterish
aftertaste
a
hint
of
something
like
cardboard
that
is
less
pleasant
still
this
grows
on
you
after
sipping
through
the
12
oz
maybe
this
would
be
a
good
quaff
ill
try
it
more
chilled
next
time
from
the
sixpack
bought
at
beach
front
liquor
in
san
clemente
o
slightly
above
average
ive
had
better
and
worse
examples
of
the
style
not
complaining
though
drinkable
and
a
good
example
o
an
average
rye
ale
probably
wouldnt
drink
it
again
but
not
bad
overall
this
isnt
really
that
bad
and
its
easy
drinking
just
a
little
bit
more
oomph
and
depth
and
this
would
really
hit
the
spot
overall
its
a
decent
brew
leans
to
the
hop
side
low
abv
nice
color
i
get
the
malt
balance
in
it
and
i
am
still
learning
my
rye
could
easily
drink
another
even
though
its
not
my
preferred
style
very
good
a
limited
release
this
hoppy
rye
has
great
balance
and
smoothness
complex
and
subtle
this
is
helping
me
become
a
big
fan
of
the
speakeasy
brewing
this
poured
out
as
a
brown
color
until
i
held
it
up
to
the
sunlight
and
saw
its
nice
deep
red
hue
the
head
was
a
cream
color
with
a
decent
retention
and
very
thin
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
toasted
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
and
malt
sweetness
the
taste
also
gave
off
a
big
toasted
flavor
upfront
with
some
subtle
chocolate
notes
as
well
the
finish
of
the
beer
was
bitter
with
some
caramel
in
the
mix
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
its
got
a
dry
finish
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
a
pretty
flavorful
session
beer
i
wish
the
rye
had
a
bigger
role
in
this
beer
and
i
also
feel
that
the
carbonation
is
too
high
for
this
ale
if
the
carbonation
was
dialed
back
a
bit
i
think
the
malt
and
hops
would
have
a
much
bigger
playing
field
to
interact
with
each
other
on
it
definitely
is
a
good
session
beer
to
have
while
watching
the
game
with
some
friends
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
mild
carbonation
a
light
body
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
fades
clean
with
rye
trailing
and
making
its
mark
the
aftertaste
is
clean
yet
funky
like
cardboard
so
this
has
some
different
qualities
to
it
overall
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
and
quite
easy
to
drink
borders
on
a
session
beer
for
me
this
lady
is
legit
and
one
i
will
seek
out
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
refreshment
and
coolness
on
the
sip
this
was
definitely
darker
in
style
for
a
rye
beer
with
generous
attention
given
to
the
malty
backbone
the
flavoring
however
was
washed
to
the
buds
and
you
actually
lose
a
lot
of
the
rye
and
sweetness
of
malt
there
was
interesting
phenolic
bitterness
which
helped
to
keep
you
interested
but
really
not
enough
when
coupled
with
the
lighter
nose
to
make
you
refill
your
glass
with
the
same
this
all
eases
up
with
heat
making
it
more
refreshing
but
again
it
is
not
enough
overall
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
rye
ale
overall
somewhat
disappointed
if
only
because
ive
been
so
impressed
with
speakeasy
beers
in
the
past
this
ones
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
strong
rye
character
you
might
want
to
look
elsewhere
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
necessarily
deliver
on
the
promise
of
the
label
this
beer
is
definitely
the
youngerlighter
sibling
of
their
imperial
red
ale
i
think
this
version
works
more
effectivelyi
love
rye
ales
red
ales
and
at
this
abv
i
could
have
more
than
one
whether
in
a
bomber
or
sixer
id
love
to
see
this
on
shelves
as
well
a
winner
clear
amber
red
ale
with
sticky
white
head
that
barely
covers
the
top
lots
of
copper
caramel
malt
aroma
with
some
chalky
chocolate
a
little
bit
of
weedy
green
wet
hops
with
a
swirl
taste
starts
with
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
not
too
bitter
but
smooths
out
the
drink
towards
the
end
a
little
bit
of
metallicblood
flavor
in
the
middle
for
good
measure
spiciness
of
rye
is
there
but
barely
noticeable
handled
the
grain
well
imho
dry
finish
balanced
mf
this
reminds
me
of
an
unimperial
version
of
betrayal
very
good
and
sessionable
would
be
good
in
the
fall
with
these
flavors
i
wish
they
released
this
in
six
packs
overall
i
would
like
to
try
this
bottled
actually
im
wondering
if
less
of
the
hoppy
notes
would
come
through
as
well
as
if
the
carbonation
makes
a
difference
a
decent
rye
beer
which
is
great
since
the
rye
selection
is
small
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
rye
caramel
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
toastroast
flavor
and
an
alcohol
kick
with
each
sip
there
is
a
mild
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
poured
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
thin
loose
head
of
foam
that
fell
before
i
even
picked
up
the
glass
nose
is
lovely
mellow
and
spicy
rye
deep
but
not
too
bold
a
light
airy
wood
and
a
modest
sweet
whiskey
dry
dark
fruit
like
raisins
nuts
and
a
touch
of
expansive
malt
sweetness
like
toffee
and
caramel
a
fragrant
bit
of
vanilla
and
i
cant
wait
to
taste
this
taste
is
lovely
spicy
rye
that
has
become
modest
with
a
bit
of
age
and
from
the
oak
barrel
deep
and
tall
rye
flavor
that
is
not
unbounded
like
most
rye
ales
but
rather
proper
and
containing
all
its
loveliness
so
that
you
can
have
it
but
so
that
it
does
not
overrun
the
other
flavors
a
touch
of
smooth
vanilla
and
airy
wood
a
surprise
in
some
brilliant
tart
cherry
the
cherry
really
enlivens
the
palate
and
lets
you
taste
all
the
malt
sweetness
by
contrast
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
with
some
tiny
prickly
bubbles
in
the
finish
a
small
warming
form
the
alcohol
smooth
and
very
mellow
this
one
awesome
beer
this
a
rich
complex
brew
full
of
big
flavor
starts
with
oak
red
wine
and
whiskey
then
works
around
to
citrus
and
resinous
hop
punch
kept
lively
by
a
heavy
carbonation
notes
of
raisin
and
plum
spicy
rye
and
apple
linger
in
the
long
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
chewy
malt
slightly
butterscotchy
othe
finish
was
lacing
but
the
beer
itself
was
worth
a
try
o
jekyll
hyde
between
the
smell
and
taste
the
tartness
in
the
nose
is
very
prominent
but
very
subdued
in
the
taste
its
tasty
but
just
a
little
muddled
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
will
definitely
seek
out
another
new
batch
e045
amazing
had
it
years
back
when
cheif
was
still
there
and
was
amazing
then
but
ididnt
remember
it
being
this
good
slightly
sour
and
a
bit
fruity
with
a
some
vanilla
taste
in
the
finish
complement
of
the
burboun
barrels
a
very
complex
beer
and
overall
just
awesome
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
right
up
there
with
brute
le
blue
and
the
original
ithaca
10
oreally
smooth
and
complex
beer
extremely
well
crafted
shared
a
bottle
with
a
few
friends
old
habit
pours
a
dark
reddishorange
color
with
a
small
head
the
nose
contains
brown
sugar
oak
cherry
and
rye
a
very
interesting
beer
so
far
and
we
have
not
even
gotten
to
the
taste
taste
has
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
vanilla
along
with
plums
cherries
and
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
some
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
tad
bitter
but
still
pleasant
overall
a
unique
beer
done
well
that
i
was
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
o
overall
this
isnt
that
bad
considering
its
infected
it
makes
for
an
interesting
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
high
overall
i
didnt
find
it
that
great
of
a
beer
the
sourness
wasnt
that
bad
tasting
but
it
overshadowed
everything
else
in
it
it
wasnt
an
awful
beer
if
you
think
of
it
as
an
american
wild
but
it
still
wasnt
that
enjoyable
beer
overall
notes
the
mouthfeel
suffers
due
to
what
seems
like
over
carbonation
in
the
bottle
tasty
beer
but
not
my
favorite
a
little
worried
by
the
sludge
but
glad
to
try
it
though
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
on
top
slow
receding
left
tons
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
really
gave
it
a
very
nice
and
very
complete
look
aroma
is
huge
lots
of
spice
at
first
caramel
molasses
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
earth
deep
hops
warming
brings
out
some
touches
of
dark
fig
like
fruit
notes
but
nothing
like
that
warm
rye
touch
that
really
adds
to
it
as
i
take
the
first
sip
a
really
wave
of
caramel
and
light
peppery
rye
hit
the
tongue
light
notes
of
chocolate
that
come
over
it
wave
after
wave
really
quite
complex
and
i
have
to
admit
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
still
very
well
done

this
beer
pours
a
dark
maple
syrup
brown
in
color
with
a
soft
and
spongy
two
finger
beige
head
it
was
very
thick
and
viscous
it
smells
of
plums
dark
sweet
malts
and
has
a
faint
whiskey
aroma
the
flavors
are
of
oaky
chocolate
light
coffee
and
a
light
whiskey
finish
its
really
nice
and
complex
and
better
than
anticipated
it
drinks
nice
and
smoothly
like
its
had
a
year
to
mellow
the
complexity
is
really
enjoyable
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
glad
i
could
share
it
the
cpj
overall
it
works
for
me
and
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
at
least
another
to
put
it
away
for
another
year
or
so
to
see
what
continues
to
happen
to
it
great
flavors
that
came
out
just
fine
with
the
infection
and
everything
the
abv
may
be
a
bit
of
a
factor
and
im
definitely
feeling
it
by
the
end
of
the
750
but
its
doable
also
fyi
i
normally
distaste
sour
beers
and
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
wow
this
has
held
up
amazingly
and
thanks
to
sites
like
beeradvocate
com
i
was
able
to
properly
prepare
this
beer
for
consumption
i
had
been
searching
for
this
for
what
seemed
like
forever
and
found
it
at
my
new
favorite
store
new
beer
distributors
in
manhattan
and
was
cautiously
optimistic
because
it
was
the
infected
batch
but
purchased
it
anyway
and
i
am
glad
this
is
delicious
ithacas
excelsior
series
have
all
been
superb
maybe
next
time
despite
the
gushing
this
was
a
really
good
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
some
more
except
i
bought
my
bottle
shop
out
perhaps
next
time
if
you
can
get
it
i
highly
recommend
it
there
is
no
reason
you
couldnt
chug
this
beer
down
or
sip
and
analyze
i
have
never
had
a
rye
beer
of
this
caliber
and
definitely
am
impressed
by
the
flavor
and
body
it
has
to
offer
i
honestly
think
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
beer
with
as
much
character
as
this
one
for
only
12750ml
enjoy
with
a
friend
and
drink
responsibly
because
the
9abv
will
sneak
upon
you
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
though
it
seemed
more
like
a
quad
to
me
lots
of
cherries
in
it
would
like
to
have
again
d
well
i
would
only
drink
a
beer
like
this
on
special
occasions
its
9
and
very
intense
so
enjoy
knowing
this
is
a
totally
drinkable
whiskey
soaked
ale
d
this
is
not
entirely
undrinkable
in
its
current
state
however
it
looks
like
sour
cherry
notes
are
pushing
it
there
and
its
not
nearly
the
beer
it
is
supposed
to
be
i
wasnt
able
to
finish
my
glass
and
drainpoured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
worth
a
shot
i
suppose
drinkability
even
in
this
state
i
can
tell
this
beer
has
the
potential
to
be
a
fine
bottle
of
suds
i
get
glimpses
of
what
the
malt
and
barrel
are
attempting
its
all
the
more
disappointing
that
its
undrinkable
drainpoured
it
after
2oz
brewing
fail
this
is
terrible
ithaca
needs
to
do
something
about
this
infection
problem
this
is
the
third
or
fourth
different
beer
ive
had
from
them
recently
that
has
been
infected
brute
yeast
doesnt
work
so
well
on
beers
other
than
brute
it
seems
ive
had
a
few
infected
off
bottles
from
these
guys
and
i
find
the
pattern
frustrating
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
despite
the
oxidation
the
alcohol
is
very
restrained
the
flavor
is
still
quite
enjoyable
and
the
mouthfeel
excellent
at
its
peak
this
must
have
been
a
powerhouse
of
a
beer
great
beer
my
only
gripe
is
that
the
crown
cap
is
a
13mm
and
i
cant
reseal
the
bottle
to
enjoy
the
rest
tomorrow
oh
well
the
sacrifices
my
liver
does
make
overall
if
you
like
whisky
youll
like
this
a
pretty
macho
beer
as
far
as
flavor
profile
very
enjoyable
as
a
sipper
big
disappointment
when
i
go
back
for
the
second
pour
a
foamy
head
of
about
4
inches
has
builtup
inside
the
bottle
ng
toward
a
slight
infection
but
i
enjoyed
the
beer
nonetheless
d
different
but
not
earth
shattering
im
glad
to
try
it
and
might
do
so
again
at
some
point
to
find
out
if
there
is
any
consistency
between
batches
good
beer
get
this
if
you
like
rye
beers
it
is
tastiest
rye
beer
ive
had
solid
head
spicy
smell
with
a
malt
scent
wafting
through
taste
is
complex
with
spiciness
plus
sweetness
in
raisins
and
mild
licorice
the
aftertaste
has
a
nice
hop
ting
but
allows
the
overall
taste
to
still
linger
the
flavors
are
so
full
and
unique
that
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
i
will
have
to
find
more
beers
from
this
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
the
beer
is
definitely
infected
but
it
doesnt
smell
too
bad
the
flavor
is
rye
and
tart
cherries
and
other
dark
fruit
i
also
get
some
roasted
malt
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
and
is
nice
and
drinkable
even
if
it
is
not
as
the
brewer
intended
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
splitting
a
bottle
four
ways
was
a
good
move
this
beer
was
halfdecent
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
too
much
of
im
not
saying
that
this
beer
isnt
infected
but
i
would
expect
a
lot
more
lactic
flavors
than
i
got
i
also
think
its
vogue
to
say
a
bottle
is
infected
right
now
start
a
thread
on
it
and
youll
get
200
replies
of
people
all
weighing
in
a
beer
theyve
never
had
there
may
have
been
a
brett
note
in
the
nose
but
i
didnt
get
any
in
the
palate
so
i
would
say
there
may
be
some
brett
in
the
bottle
but
definitely
no
lactobacillus
to
often
all
you
see
are
oak
aged
stouts
which
are
beautiful
but
sometimes
the
oak
can
overpower
a
stout
and
become
unbalanced
this
rye
beer
example
is
superb
and
i
tip
my
cap
to
ithica
for
creating
such
a
magical
beer
i
will
be
very
excited
to
enjoy
theirtwelve
a
belgian
style
quadrupel
d
i
heard
about
the
storied
batch
e017
being
infected
and
i
got
a
little
excited
about
that
judging
by
the
slooow
gusher
it
had
a
bit
of
infection
but
not
enough
to
sour
it
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
was
pretty
much
as
ithaca
intended
it
d
very
drinkable
if
you
like
strong
and
sweet
and
boozy
and
bitter
i
like
strong
and
sweet
and
boozy
and
bitter
personally
drinkability
overall
im
disappointed
the
wonderful
complexity
of
the
nose
gets
drenched
in
alcohol
and
is
lost
in
the
taste
its
a
beer
that
is
more
fun
to
look
at
and
im
jealous
of
those
who
lucked
into
a
sourversion
deep
dark
cherry
with
millions
of
suspended
yeast
particles
and
a
creamy
pinkish
tinted
tan
head
that
melts
slowly
leaving
tons
of
crusty
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
excellent
dark
cherries
and
figs
with
spicy
rye
and
toasted
oak
rich
dark
fruit
with
spicy
rye
and
warmly
alcoholic
oaky
whiskey
flavors
complex
and
kind
of
funky
finishes
hot
full
bodied
with
tons
of
carbonation
which
adds
to
the
drinkability
well
if
it
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
it
must
be
good
after
getting
differing
reports
on
this
batch
i
was
hoping
mine
wouldnt
be
one
of
the
infected
bottles
but
it
was
clearly
apparent
from
the
pour
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
funky
experience
not
terrible
but
i
would
like
to
try
the
beer
as
it
was
intended
d
not
really
too
undrinkable
but
you
gotta
like
the
funk
to
finish
one
of
these
opening
the
bottle
gusher
ahoy
cloudy
brown
burgundy
color
with
a
massive
tan
head
that
never
fades
and
coats
the
glass
in
lacing
aroma
is
lacking
dry
and
soda
like
and
with
sleight
whiskey
and
alcohol
pinch
very
medicinal
and
antiseptic
not
very
appealing
flavor
actually
isnt
as
bad
as
expected
we
agree
its
a
mess

balancing

i
really
didnt
get
a
sense
of
rye
at
all
from
this
maybe
because
its
been
aged
for
over
a
year
still
what
are
you
waiting
for
old
habit
would
be
a
hard
habit
to
break
if
i
lived
in
ibcs
distribution
area
not
that
id
want
to
i
feel
as
though
i
can
firmly
say
that
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
overall
a
beautiful
beer
in
general
if
you
see
it
dont
hesitate
if
you
did
youd
be
robbing
yourself
of
an
experience
beautiful
one
of
my
most
amazing
experiences
with
beer
in
very
recent
memory
if
ithaca
doesnt
make
this
a
regular
in
their
lineup
with
raspberries
but
has
a
strong
backbone
of
nuts

i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
since
it
came
out
mild

pours
a
pretty
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
sheet
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
as
there
is
some
burnt
brown
sugar
spices
and
woodsey
hops
more
going
on
with
the
taste
even
with
some
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
in
the
mix
as
well
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
but
that
only
last
a
couple
of
seconds
overall
a
decent
brew
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
a
truly
great
beer
woodsy
flavors
rye
spice
creamy
texture
with
tight
carbonation
and
fluff
for
miles
on
the
head
almost
a
smoky
flavor
some
sweetness
strong
flavors
but
all
good
flavors
a
bit
bitter
but
pleasant
aftertaste
rich
complex
sturdy
massively
excellent
beer
that
just
kicks
ass
solid
older
brew
from
chicago
hard
with
tb
not
selling
that
much
and
worrying
how
fresh
it
is
o
an
excellent
red
rye
that
has
a
flavorful
malty
backbone
dg
two
brothers
cane
and
ebel
45
bear
republics
hop
rod
is
a
solid
rival
so
if
you
like
it
youll
like
this
one
fruity
followed
by
hoppy
bitterness
dark
brown
in
color
with
great
clarity
a
fingernail
of
creamy
beige
colored
head
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
intriguing
aroma
of
rye
and
cane
sugar
along
with
piney
hops
playing
more
of
a
background
note
the
flavor
is
comprised
of
ryecane
sugarand
piney
hops
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
has
the
sharp
edge
from
the
spicy
rye
if
you
like
sweet
and
dry
this
is
a
delicious
rye
the
creamy
finish
is
delightful
with
a
murderous
hoppy
finish
what
too
soon
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
really
fun
beer
with
a
lot
of
qualities
that
will
keep
you
interested
with
every
new
sip
the
balance
is
evident
by
the
brews
ability
to
give
you
impressions
of
the
nice
base
malts
the
rye
as
well
as
some
really
fun
hop
aromas
and
flavors
would
definitely
buy
this
again

just
a
taste
but
i
had
to
make
note
this
goes
into
the
wwtt
file
what
were
they
thinking
i
should
start
by
confessing
to
not
being
a
big
hops
fan
but
the
effrontery
of
the
rye
negates
any
nuances
im
not
big
on
slamming
a
beer
but
im
leaving
this
message
in
a
bottle
so
i
dont
ever
get
caught
up
in
the
mystery
of
the
name
of
this
brew
again
might
be
ryeght
for
some
but
im
not
that
guy
yum
yum
excellent
rye
and
with
a
great
red
hue
excellent
beer
final
thoughts
really
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
picked
it
up
for
a
buck
which
was
a
very
good
deal
im
typically
not
a
rye
beer
fan
but
two
brothers
brewing
co
definitely
knows
how
to
work
their
malt
bill
to
strike
a
great
balance
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
still
my
favorite
two
brothers
beer
i
always
love
coming
back
to
this
one
this
beer
is
pours
a
beautiful
deep
reddark
brownish
color
with
a
nice
cream
head
that
rises
just
over
an
inch
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
nice
previews
the
hop
taste
that
is
to
come
with
your
first
sip
a
nice
balance
hop
taste
with
a
great
malted
barley
taste
its
a
complex
flavored
beer
but
not
so
bold
that
someone
who
doesnt
get
into
the
super
bold
beer
styles
shouldnt
like
it
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
drinking
having
mine
with
some
popcorn
lol
and
it
goes
awesome
a
very
good
brew
my
favorite
two
brothers
brew
so
far
ontap
at
hollywood
stadium
inside
hollywood
casino
in
joliet
il
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
slight
brown
foamy
head
good
aroma
of
toasted
rye
has
a
strong
bitter
flavor
and
full
of
rye
tones
lots
of
bold
bitter
flavors
and
very
well
made
packs
a
nice
rye
punch
pretty
much
what
i
was
looking
for
when
i
picked
up
a
pack
12oz
bottle
aroma
of
rich
grain
piney
hops
and
sweet
malt
pours
dark
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
flavors
of
spicy
grain
resinous
hops
with
a
pronounced
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
bitter
not
bad
last
beer
of
birthday
night
so
impressed
that
i
remembered
it
at
all
this
is
quite
frankly
one
of
the
best
rye
ipas
i
have
had
this
was
really
good
the
rye
and
hop
flavors
balanced
well
and
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
very
drinkable
would
get
again
for
sure
mahogany
color
with
sharp
rye
flavors
and
hoppy
characteristic
nice
overall
balance
but
not
as
impressed
as
i
thought
i
would
be
though
the
thai
palm
sugar
is
a
good
touch
though
it
doesnt
put
it
over
the
top
for
me
above
average
beer
but
not

moderately
hazy
deep

with
a
12
finger
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small

that

of
mango

and

damn

on

for
a

very
nice

of

with
a
nice
crisp

and
zero
cloying

after
the

medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
smooth
and
moderately
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
hoppy
rye
ale
all
around
good
balance
and
complexity
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
great
beer
a
bold
and
beer
with
strong
flavors
given
its
hop
profile
and
rye
but
very
well
balanced
its
sweetness
could
be
tuned
down
a
bit
if
you
like
rye
beers
and
a
hoppy
punch
you
got
to
try
this
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sugary
some
hops
as
well
taste
is
good
and
unique
some
hops
rye
a
bit
of
sweetness
palm
sugar
adds
a
different
flavor
slight
bitterness
well
done
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
decent
but
nothing
too
fancy
id
probably
pick
it
up
again
at
some
point
if
i
saw
it
but
im
not
in
any
hurry
overall
its
understandable
why
this
is
one
their
staples
rye
can
be
somewhat
harsh
sometimes
but
this
is
really
well
done
cane
and
ebel
stands
tall
as
an
excellent
showcase
of
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
rye
but
its
up
there
and
its
certainly
one
of
the
easiest
premium
rye
ales
to
obtain
in
the
midwest
the
cane
and
ebel
was
a
great
beer
the
color
was
very
dark
similar
to
a
stout
the
aroma
was
subtle
yet
inviting
the
head
was
not
very
frothy
either
the
flavor
was
awesome
i
never
had
a
rye
beer
before
but
it
was
interesting
there
was
no
horrible
after
taste
and
was
not
too
thick
definitely
give
ryes
a
try
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
pretty
damned
good
beer
excellent
beer
for
sure
i
said
it
three
or
four
times
already
but
this
screams
style
red
ipa
until
the
beer
is
basically
down
your
throat
i
tend
to
find
that
rye
beers
that
are
really
heavy
on
the
rye
almost
present
a
vomit
sort
of
flavor
appealing
right
so
i
welcome
the
burst
of
hops
that
i
get
from
this
beer
id
very
happily
revisit
this
beer
ocomplex
flavors
in
this
rye
ale
enjoyable
to
savor
o
solid
refreshing
flavorful
beer
my
first
rye
and
left
a
good
impression
overall
an
excellent
and
tasty
rye
ale
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
highly
recommend
as
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
i
was
very
excited
to
receive
this
bottle
as
a
gift
it
pours
a
translucent
carbonated
deep
ruddy
hue
with
a
thick
layer
of
foam
blanketing
the
top
excellent
retention
and
lacing
its
got
a
very
sweet
yet
earthy
aroma
likely
due
to
the
palm
sugar
i
actually
am
imagining
raw
sugar
cane
having
a
similar
scent
bready
grains
were
noted
along
with
a
touch
of
lemon
balm
or
hyssop
the
flavor
was
quite
hoppy
with
toasted
rye
bread
and
a
backing
from
the
malts
it
finishes
very
dry
overall
this
felt
a
little
light
across
the
palate
but
was
still
very
enjoyable
o
i
was
expecting
a
hoppy
rye
ale
but
definitely
not
that
hoppy
floral
and
grapefruit
hops
but
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
level
of
hops
and
bitterness
well
balanced
smooth
and
very
drinkable
rye
beer
overall
this
is
great
was
not
expecting
the
amount
of
flavor
and
aroma
it
packs
if
you
like
rye
and
hops
this
is
one
to
try
for
sure
single
finger
head
with
excellent
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
with
golden
hues
body
aroma
of
toasted
and
caramel
malt
rye
breads
candied
orange
and
earthy
hops
flavor
is
nicely
breadt
with
nice
rye
presence
earthy
hops
citrus
hops
and
a
nutty
and
musty
sensation
which
carries
throughout
the
experience
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
very
complex
and
very
smooth
there
is
a
lot
more
to
this
one
than
i
can
pull
out
from
it
a
must
try
overall
a
very
solid
very
drinkable
hoppy
rye
brew
definitely
a
ryeipa
blend
a
definite
standout
in
the
catagory
bottom
line
quality
brew
poured
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
small
stable
offwhite
head
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
and
toasted
rye
malts
nicely
balanced
same
in
the
taste
toastyed
rye
caramel
citrus
crisp
hop
bitterness
clean
dry
medium
body
moderate

easily
drinkable
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
sweetness
is
cloying
masking
the
rye
too
much
for
my
tastes
however
this
is
still
enjoyable
in
an
odd
way
a
little
too
sweet
but
there
is
a
decent
hoppyness
to
help
try
and
balance
it
out
spicy
dry
bitter
tropical
and
citrusy
yeah
id
buy
it
again
o
i
will
have
to
go
back
and
look
but
this
may
be
the
best
rye
beer
i
have
ever
had
sweet
rye
flavors
makes
it
drinkable
like
an
amber
i
wish
i
always
had
access
to
this
oits
no
reds
rye
pa
but
still
one
the
better
hoppy
ryereds
out
there
overall
i
am
very
happy
with
the
way
earthy
rye
and
bitter
hops
dance
in
this
ale
this
unique
ale
really
works
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
two
brothers
partly
because
i
like
supporting
small
independent
businesses
but
mostly
because
they
make
very
drinkable
beer
and
cane
and
ebel
is
another
example
of
thatwith
super
flavor
and
a
relatively
low
abv
i
definitely
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
not
bat
an
eyethis
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
on
your
local
independent
beer
store
or
if
youre
traveling
through
the
chicagoland
areatwo
brothers
strikes
again
45
o
this
this
is
what
a
great
beer
should
be
you
could
search
the
entire
world
for
a
better
rye
beer
and
come
up
completely
empty
handed
and
dumb
founded
well
done
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
the
thai
palm
sugar
adds
an
interesting
sweetness
and
flavor
to
the
beer
neither
does
the
rye
or
hops
dominate
over
each
others
o
high
drinkability
and
a
nice
combo
of
rye
and
hops
i
used
light
as
an
adjective
frequently
in
this
brew
because
it
displays
a
good
amount
of
finesse
o
i
killed
a
six
pack
of
this
over
the
span
of
three
days
along
with
all
the
other
goodies
i
had
in
between
ill
be
revisiting
this
brew
when
im
in
the
area
quite
often
now
im
sure
overall
this
is
the
first
rye
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
am
not
pleased
lol
to
me
this
basically
just
tastes
like
a
nasty
ipa
with
rye
added
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
offwhite
head
moderate
retention
on
a
dark
amber
body
lacing
is
soapy
and
clear
sticky
aroma
includes
some
caramel
malt
but
is
certainly
dominated
by
quite
a
hop
bill
resinous
hop
juiciness
in
the
form
of
grapefruit
and
grass
some
earthiness
taste
is
biting
and
bitter
balanced
by
some
nice
malt
sweetness
tongue
coating
with
a
warming
mouthfeel
very
tasty
complex
rye
malty
hoppy
everything
you
could
ever
want
from
one
bier
o
this
is
yet
another
brewery
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
their
more
driven
towards
taste
over
abv
track
them
down
and
enjoy
like
a
victorious
viking
lol
o
far
exceeding
my
expectations
first
brew
from
two
brothers
this
suits
my
classification
for
a
higher
gravity
wellhopped
red
ale
clean
flavors
and
alcohol
kept
in
check
this
beer
goes
down
fast
for
a
7
abv
it
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
rainy
evening
two
brothers
use
of
rye
is
the
best
i
have
had
as
they
did
not
over
do
it
while
creating
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
cheers
all
in
all
very
very
tasty
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
and
hard
to
find
since
the
beer
is
well
past
its
expiration
date
i
can
imagine
that
the
hop
presence
must
be
more
pronounced
in
a
fresher
example
as
it
stands
though
this
expired
sample
was
fine
drinking
anyway
overall
something
i
am
absolutely
looking
forward
to
getting
more
of
i
have
not
had
all
that
much
from
2
bros
yet
but
have
really
liked
what
ive
tasted
so
far
o
outstanding
world
class
one
of
the
best
beers
one
could
find
anywhere
in
my
humble
opinion
poured
7ozs
into
my
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
clear
mahogany
brown
with
no
head
unless
vigorously
shaken
the
nose
is
candy
sweet
malt
with
almost
no
hops
or
spice
the
taste
is
intensely
sweet
with
a
subtle
pine
hoppiness
and
slight
rye
spice
this
is
not
the
beer
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
with
a
slight
bite
from
the
hopsrye
its
smooth
and
drinkable
but
really
nothing
special
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
worth
sampling
at
a
brewfest
but
not
a
top
10
rye
overall
if
you
like
rye
beers
this
is
one
to
look
for
in
the
great
lakes
beer
region
its
good
beer
from
chicago
the
color
is
gorgeous
like
a
copper
beauty
shiny
from
a
healthy
application
of
massage
oil
the
malt
and
sweetness
flirt
hard
with
the
spice
of
the
rye
and
bitterness
of
the
hops
its
no
surprise
these
two
hook
up
for
an
orgy
of
deliciousness
that
results
in
a
simultaneous
orgasm
that
leaves
you
gasping
for
air
and
dreaming
of
your
next
sip
o
easily
my
favorite
rye
to
date
if
you
are
looking
to
pack
some
kick
with
comfort
food
this
is
a
great
option
i
would
make
an
effort
to
get
this
again
thankfully
its
readily
available
drink
a
good
beer
shouldve
brought
a
6
pk
home
but
didnt
have
the
room
for
6
more
beers
want
more
o
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
ryes
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
rye
and
pine
two
qualities
that
i
think
go
quite
well
together
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
lot
of
rye
and
pine
and
not
too
much
else
low
to
medium
bitterness
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
fairly
straightforward
but
also
very
good
o
a
beer
that
i
will
buy
i
again
im
promising
myself
that
today
even
yes
it
is
quite
sweet
and
sweet
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
qualities
in
a
pale
ale
cane
and
ebel
though
has
the
biggest
rye
bite
ive
tasted
since
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
and
that
my
friends
is
something
to
admire
m
while
creamy
the
body
is
just
a
hair
thinner
that
id
like
to
feel
at
this
abv
texture
is
fine
grained
and
sticks
to
the
tongue
well
carbonation
is
high
enough
to
carry
the
flavors
into
the
palate
but
low
enough
not
to
get
in
the
way
overall
a
very
citrus
forward
beer
with
enough
rye
to
reign
in
the
flavor
and
keep
the
profile
in
check
o
my
favorite
rye
beer
and
a
prime
example
of
the
style
it
has
a
nice
dose
of
hops
which
i
like
and
a
nice
dose
of
rye
which
i
also
like
the
mouthfeel
is
great
as
well
glad
to
have
this
beer
superlocal
overall
if
you
want
hops
with
no
balance
here
is
your
beer
i
like
hops
but
i
cannot
find
one
bit
of
sweetness
or
redeeming
taste
to
allow
anything
but
hops
to
be
tasted
in
this
beer
o
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
the
taste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
irish
ale
overall
its
a
solid
beer
super
smooth
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
at
7
that
may
not
be
wise
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
the
best
coming
from
two
brother
this
brewery
is
awesome
and
i
am
glad
that
they
are
local
to
me
nicely
carbonated
crisp
and
well
balanced
o
very
good
a
big
hoppy
beer
that
is
complex
and
i
can
enjoy
these
often
reviewed

like
it
very
much
so
a
good
rye
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
my
local
two
brothers
brewery
o
great
beer
good
balance
of
sweetness
bitterness
o
i
really
enjoy
this
rye
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
a
little
less
sugary
oif
the
body
had
more
carbonation
i
would
have
really
enjoyed
this
but
it
really
knocked
it
down
a
couple
pegs
i
will
revisit
in
the
future
and
hopefully
it
was
just
my
bottle
the
flavors
were
nice
though
and
it
was
probably
the
best
tasting
offering
from
two
brothers
overall
one
of
the
best
two
brothers
beers
a
very
good
rye
beer
in
general
to
be
sure
there
was
alcohol
too
but
it
never
felt
too
strong
this
is
a
rye
beer
and
a
great
example
of
that
as
there
was
just
a
hint
of
spice
to
offset
the
sweetness
i
loved
this
beer
and
even
though
its
not
for
everyone
two
brothers
has
a
winner
here
id
certainly
buy
this
again
also
starting
to
have
questions
about
two
brothers
d
this
is
the
best
rye
beer
i
have
had
to
date
really
nice
flavor
profile
to
and
pretty
damn
attractive
in
the
glass
glad
to
see
this
in
six
packs
now
with
about
the
same
price
point
it
used
to
be
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future

d
i
think
this
would
have
worked
better
if
they
used
less
bittering
hops
in
any
case
its
at
least
interesting
o
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
overall
it
doesnt
necessarily
kill
it
in
any
one
aspect
but
makes
for
a
great
overall
package
i
would
certainly
drink
this
agian
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
very
well
balanced
and
the
abv
seems
to
be
hidden
fairly
well
dr
pretty
drinkable
but
it
costs
a
lot
it
isnt
as
unique
as
it
should
be
hides
its
abv
well
for
a
rye
beer
its
not
bad
pours
a
a
murky
brownishamber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
sweet
with
some
lovely
hop
aromas
sweet
caramel
malt
as
well
somewhat
piney
maple
syrup
taste
is
immediately
caramel
malt
with
some
delicious
rye
flavors
great
hops
balanced
with
rye
and
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
honey
and
citrus
a
lot
of
pine
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
well
carbonated
with
a
somewhat
sticky
finish
drinkability
is
high
overall
i
really
wish
there
were
more
rye
beers
this
is
a
great
one
o
good
rye
beer
with
nice
hoppiness
one
of
my
favorites
from
two
brothers
hoppy
bitterness
begins
the
palates
journey
with
pine
up
front
with
a
good
solid
bready
backbone
a
well
balanced
and
very
solid
take
on
a
rye
p
a
i
can
drink
this
everyday
and
not
get
tired
of
it
medium
body
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
drinkable
hoppy
spicy
and
delicious
id
buy
this
regularly
if
it
was
available
here
o
a
rye
beer
that
is
at
once
spicy
hoppy
and
malty
really
a
great
offering
my
first
from
two
bros
wont
be
my
last
o
a
really
solid
drinker
there
is
a
great
balance
with
the
malty
sweetness
and
the
spicy
rye
each
flavor
is
spot
on
i
like
it
if
it
were
available
near
me
id
buy
some
bottles
every
now
and
again
do
this
intensely
savory
beer
drowns
out
the
advertised
hoppedup
qualities
borrowing
just
enough
citrus
to
allow
a
nod
in
the
direction
of
balance
it
combines
a
solid
maltdominated
front
end
with
fairly
strong
pure
bitterness
at
the
end
while
as
drinkable
as
most
ipas
it
seems
a
bit
less
composed
that
some
other
offerings
from
two
brothers
such
as
domaine
du
paige
or
resistance
an
extremely
tasty
beer
full
of
complexity
and
style
if
they
could
lower
the
abv
a
point
to
avoid
the
detectable
ethanol
this
would
improve
the
beer
i
believe
this
would
be
even
more
spectacular
when
fresh
pours
a
deep
ruby
with
an
offwhite
rocky
foam
head
some
of
which
clings
to
the
glass
on
its
way
down
rye
malts
are
prevalent
in
the
nose
though
the
hops
take
a
close
second
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
too
the
rye
pairs
perfectly
with
how
bitter
this
brew
is
dry
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
expect
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
from
two
bros
a
brewery
thats
soon
becoming
one
of
my
local
favorites
o
i
really
wish
i
would
have
opened
this
sooner
to
realize
the
full
effect
of
the
hops
regardless
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
i
will
most
certainly
seek
out
again
poured
a
brilliant
orangeamber
color
with
a
smallish
beige
colored
head
a
little
spicy
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
caramel
some
cereal
and
rye
bread
on
the
palate
this
one
is
sweet
crisp
and
medium
bodied
with
some
caramel
rye
toasted
malt
and
cereal
this
is
a
good
rye
beer
im
not
crazy
about
the
palm
sugar
but
combined
with
the
impressive
rye
profile
and
some
assertive
hoppiness
its
a
unique
beer
o
a
great
take
on
the
style
rare
as
it
is
great
complexity
smooth
and
yet
a
bit
angry
nice
and
thick
on
the
palate
nicely
carbonated
and
crisp
complex
blend
of
rye
and
hops
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
very
slightly
sweet
tasty
overall
a
very
good
rye
beer
great
flavor
and
a
easy
drinkability
very
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
overall
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
i
like
it
dgood
brew
excellent
for
sessions
fairly
decent
balance
of
the
hopsrye
would
recommend
to
anyone
to
have
as
a
regular
brew
in
their
fridge
cane
ebel
is
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
cola
colored
brew
which
glows
an
amber
read
when
held
to
the
light
topping
it
off
is
a
goodsized
foamy
tan
colored
head
sheets
of
lacing
adorn
the
glass
the
scent
is
pretty
hoppy
with
rye
of
course
with
maybe
just
a
touch
of
sourness
the
taste
is
pretty
big
and
bold
lots
of
grainy
characteristics
from
the
rye
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
though
it
is
wellblended
some
spice
from
the
alcohol
fair
amount
of
citrus
and
grapefruit
tones
pretty
sweet
medium
bodied
and
sharp
on
the
tongue
o
a
very
nice
rye
beer
and
would
go
well
just
about
any
time
of
year
the
taste
and
beer
itself
is
nice
and
coating
with
that
piney
hop
making
this
interesting
and
wanting
to
come
back
for
more
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
two
brothers
moreys
bottom
line
i
like
this
beer
alot
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
founders
reds
rye
or
bear
republic
hop
rod
rye
but
just
as
good
a
fun
beer
to
sip
on
and
talk
about
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
rye
beers
but
theres
some
characteristics
that
bring
it
down
besides
the
rye
still
drinkable
but
not
great
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
i
like
rye
but
if
you
dont
then
this
probably
isnt
for
you
as
its
one
of
the
more
rye
forward
beers
ive
tried
o
two
brothers
cane
ebel
rye
comes
off
like
an
east
coast
aipa
brown
ale
hybrid
the
rye
is
certainly
the
star
of
the
show
and
is
presented
in
a
winning
and
approachable
way
from
top
to
bottom
effortlessly
and
deceptively
well
put
together
job
well
done
brothers
ohands
down
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
the
last
year
overall
a
decent
beer
and
a
definitely
recommendation
overall
this
is
really
smooth
and
unique
easy
to
drink
after
you
get
used
to
the
flavor
the
mix
of
rye
and
hops
sets
this
apart
from
other
rye
beers
very
tasty
would
recommend
to
try
this
one
color
is
a
murky
brown
with
a
thin
head
of
white
creamy
lace
aroma
is
sweet
creamy
caramel
hops
and
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
spicy
rye
pine
hop
and
sweet
flavors
are
well
balanced
noticeable
spicytangy
rye
presence
zesty
citrus
and
resiny
hop
finish
with
a
lasting
bitterness
overall
a
spicy
hoppy
and
substantially
flavored
ryebased
beer
really
good
i
would
like
to
find
more
rye
beers
all
the
ones
i
had
have
impressed
me
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
that
i
have
ever
tasted
if
you
enjoy
any
type
of
rye
this
is
a
beer
for
you
overall
the
taste
sneaks
up
on
you
nice
interplay
of
the
earthy
hop
spicy
character
of
rye
the
mellow
maltsugar
cane
and
the
alcohol
very
tasty
mellow
but
strong
in
equal
measure
cane
abel
is
a
showcase
of
brewing
skill
melding
jaw
breaking
strength
with
a
balanced
profile
that
belies
that
strength
and
settles
into
a
balanced
easy
drinker
pours
a
light
crystal
clear
brown
with
ample
sticky
lacing
this
brew
starts
with
a
malty
caramel
aroma
that
buoys
a
significant
eatery
piny
hop
aroma
the
first
sip
is
surprising
as
the
aggressive
hop
content
does
not
attack
the
tastebuds
with
prickly
abandon
instead
choosing
to
lay
in
wait
allowing
the
smooth
body
to
mellow
into
a
melange
of
malt
sugars
then
gradually
creep
back
lending
a
long
resiny
aspect
to
the
flavorful
finish
skirting
the
territory
of
the
barley
wine
cane
abel
deftly
avoids
that
moniker
choosing
instead
a
strong
but
flavorful
profile
that
hides
its
muscles
in
a
classy
and
complex
veil
of
flavors
very
well
done
from
this
young
brewery
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
chicago
and
its
wide
availability
in
the
area
makes
it
one
of
my
standards
goose
island
honkers
ale
used
to
be
the
flagship
beer
of
chicago
the
cane
ebel
has
surpassed
it
and
should
be
viewed
as
chicagos
goto
beer
o
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
i
have
encountered
something
to
look
out
for
and
pick
up
overall
impression
awesome
beer
to
have
for
my
first
brew
from
two
brothers
good
amount
of
body
solid
taste
but
has
a
tough
drinkability
good
beer
to
enjoy
over
a
good
amount
of
time
or
with
a
meal
very
tasty
rye
beer
not
as
hoppy
as
some
others
ive
had
but
has
more
rich
maltiness
than
those
examples
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
wouldve
liked
a
bit
more
punch
to
the
aroma
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
very
good
brew
good
atmosphere
nice
body
decent
enough
head
and
tons
o
lacing
nose
and
flavor
both
full
malty
and
pungent
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
this
is
another
great
hoppy
rye
ale
a
style
i
am
definitely
in
love
with
its
not
quite
on
par
with
founders
reds
rye
but
close
good
stuff
this
brew
has
an
awesome
color
to
it
a
deep
reddish
brown
that
has
a
hazy
opaqe
fog
thick
walls
of
lacing
cling
almost
the
whole
glass
the
nose
is
pine
filled
and
very
hoppy
it
tastes
fresh
and
hoppy
pine
dominates
the
taste
buds
and
is
then
met
with
a
malty
backdrop
a
crisp
mouthfeel
nails
the
palate
with
an
intense
bitterness
and
ample
carbonation
overall
great
drink
with
a
tasty
hop
presense
draft
to
pint
looked
good
for
a
rye
deep
in
color
wshades
of
red
and
brown
smelled
great
hoppy
with
the
twang
of
the
rye
noticeable
taste
was
hoppy
and
tangy
just
like
it
should
be
mouthfeel
was
good
the
tanginess
made
it
drink
like
a
wild
ale
but
without
all
the
carbonation
overall
a
quality
brew
thats
great
on
draft
balanced
and
tasty
beer
that
really
seems
to
bring
home
the
idea
of
beer
is
food
delicious
and
inviting
i
would
drink
this
regularly
if
i
could
get
it
highly
recommended
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
red
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
head
fades
not
leaving
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
hoppy
a
little
sweet
and
has
some
spice
the
taste
had
some
sugary
sweetness
nothing
overwhelming
theres
also
some
spicy
rye
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodies
and
has
a
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
worthy
of
an
a
just
my
opinion
though
overall
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
body
and
lacing
aroma
is
nice
but
mouthfeel
unfortunately
was
a
bit
disappointing
its
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
just
not
one
id
order
twice
when
there
are
so
many
other
options
now
od
dangerously
easy
to
put
down
remains
one
of
my
favorites
for
any
occasion
too
bad
duff27
isnt
here
to
partake
the
7
abv
warms
a
bit
and
this
is
certainly
bold
but
i
really
like
the
rye
in
here
and
the
complex
flavors
a
nice
deep
pour
of
red
ruby
brown
with
a
sticky
but
small
head
complex
with
a
great
balance
of
dense
caramel
fruit
and
notes
of
vanilla
nose
of
pine
and
blood
orange
and
hints
of
grapefruit
this
is
aromatic
only
though
the
palate
is
more
apple
with
a
floral
zest
hint
and
a
great
feel
o
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
find
glad
the
beer
guy
at
my
local
store
suggested
it
the
flavors
do
not
overwhelm
they
are
just
an
enjoyable
show
that
this
beer
puts
on
for
your
tongue
overall
very
drinkable
but
something
about
the
rye
makes
it
more
bitter
than
sweet
which
i
like
in
my
ipas
i
did
like
it
though
and
believe
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
i
guess
rye
just
doesnt
wow
me
i
do
have
a
couple
more
beers
by
these
guys
so
heres
hoping
i
like
them
more
othis
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
complex
excellent
combo
of
hoppiness
and
rye
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
solid
worth
a
try
very
nice
brew
for
any
ipa
drinker
herbal
hop
bitterness
up
front
a
touch
of
singed
almost
smoky
malts
follow
before
caramel
and
fruit
ripe
pear
sweetness
take
over
any
sweetness
is
handily
checked
by
lasting
herbal
and
pine
bitterness
theres
also
a
spicy
edge
to
everything
making
for
a
deliciously
complex
taste
dry
finish
with
lingering
citrus
hop
bitterness
and
traces
of
spicy
caramel
mediumfull
body
with
a
delectably
creamy
feel
great
beer
o
this
is
a
truly
fine
beer
at
7
too
strong
for
a
session
but
i
want
to
have
one
after
another
nonetheless
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
beer
is
great
huge
hop
flavors
without
any
off
flavors
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
a
rye
beer
and
not
a
top
notch
ipa
is
its
color
as
a
bonus
you
could
drink
this
all
day
it
seems
job
well
done
two
brothers
ive
looked
at
this
beer
on
the
shelves
for
years
and
never
got
one
why
this
is
a
great
great
brew
im
a
huge
fan
of
several
beers
ive
had
lately
with
the
addition
of
rye
hopefully
this
catches
on
and
more
brewers
experiment
with
it
o
loved
this
version
of
a
hopped
up
rye
beer
its
tastycreamy
and
hoppy
very
enjoyable
will
be
drinking
this
again
and
again
we
got
destroyed
at
quizzo
tonight
so
hopefully
this
is
enough
to
make
me
feel
a
bit
better
it
pours
a
clear
ruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
dirty
white
foam
and
exhibiting
a
decent
amount
of
matter
floating
about
within
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
onion
toasted
rye
bread
black
pepper
and
dark
toffee
the
taste
holds
notes
of
soil
orange
rind
light
mandarin
orange
potato
skin
grass
and
a
touch
of
toffee
i
winced
a
bit
whilst
drinking
this
the
body
is
a
barelylight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
i
was
not
much
of
a
fan
of
this
at
all
really
the
flavors
dont
do
anything
all
that
great
for
me
and
the
smell
comes
kinda
close
to
offensive
i
can
see
how
this
could
actually
be
a
lot
worse
but
that
doesnt
make
it
very
good
o
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
i
have
encountered
something
to
look
out
for
and
pick
up
overall
i
wouldve
liked
this
to
maybe
lower
the
ending
bitterness
in
the
flavor
and
perhaps
let
more
of
the
hop
flavors
to
shine
through
all
in
all
though
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
wish
it
were
distributed
here
this
really
comes
off
feeling
boozier
than
it
is
and
it
defies
classification
i
think
ba
put
into
the
rye
category
because
its
brewed
with
that
grain
but
it
doesnt
conform
to
any
style
and
i
love
that
o
easily
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
two
brothers
nice
flavor
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
o
solid
beer
went
down
very
easily
and
quickly
o
this
is
just
a
great
beer
there
is
something
to
please
a
lot
of
people
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
tons
of
malt
flavor
with
the
complexity
of
rye
and
some
palm
sugar
which
may
not
be
tasted
directly
but
it
must
add
to
the
complexity
of
flavor
which
is
great
higher
on
the
alcohol
but
not
a
huge
beer
fantastic
rye
beer
o
i
think
spicy
malty
when
i
drink
this
beer
it
is
sweet
and
overbalanced
to
the
malty
side
but
nonetheless
complex
and
quite
nice
my
bottle
is
marked
best
by
62811
and
it
seems
fresh
thanks
two
brothers
that
said
nothing
here
is
exceptional
or
amazing
just
very
well
done
across
the
board
the
brothers
are
local
so
i
will
have
to
make
a
trip
to
further
study
this
beer
in
its
native
habitat
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
everything
worked
for
me
i
would
definitely
have
another
great
beer
id
always
be
down
for
one
of
these
it
was
reminiscent
of
nosferatu
imo
hoppy
tasty
red
ale
recommended
cult
classic
comes
at
us
throwing
hops
and
rye
dim
mahogany
topped
with
an
offwhite
lacing
this
looks
like
a
serious
beer
aromas
of
spicy
rye
orangey
hops
toasted
bready
malt
and
fruity
esters
mouthwatering
big
malty
body
flexes
with
a
creamy
smoothness
rye
grips
the
taste
buds
as
a
hint
of
caramel
caresses
hops
come
off
a
little
sharp
to
start
but
the
flavor
kicks
in
with
citrus
rind
and
mild
tobacco
warming
alcohol
has
no
problem
showing
its
7
percent
warming
and
a
little
fruity
truly
epic
drinking
overall
a
good
beer
hoppier
than
expected
which
was
enjoyable
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
is
substantial
enough
without
becoming
heavy
at
7
this
is
one
that
could
be
consumed
all
evening
very
enjoyable
it
encompasses
about
everything
i
look
for
in
an
easy
drinking
beverage
cant
stress
enough
the
care
taken
to
create
pleasing
balance
in
cane
and
ebel
had
a
bottle
a
restaurant
near
me
the
server
had
no
idea
what
it
was
or
how
to
explain
it
to
me
so
it
was
a
total
surprise
when
i
poured
it
in
and
sampled
excellent
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
rye
both
hop
and
rye
flavors
are
wellbalanced
all
the
way
through
with
the
grainy
sourness
of
the
rye
blending
well
with
the
citrusy
hops
the
finish
is
smooth
and
the
flavors
linger
pleasantly
for
quite
a
while
after
the
sip
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
for
any
climate
or
any
season
the
numerous
flavors
and
the
way
they
bend
and
balance
is
great
drinkability
very
nice
almost
as
good
as
reds
will
have
to
watch
this
one
for
sales
d
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
and
cane
ebel
is
surely
a
beer
ill
pick
up
again
when
i
get
another
chance
d
amazing
i
forgot
how
much
i
really
like
this
beer
needs
to
be
in
socal
asap
this
is
delicious
complex
and
overall
fantastic
love
it
d
great
drink
for
a
rye
beer
another
quality
brew
by
two
brothers
great
job
blending
complex
ingredients
of
rye
hops
to
produce
a
delicate
balance
of
smooth
taste
i
would
definitely
have
a
few
more
d
a
solid
offering
from
two
brothers
one
that
i
revisit
often
and
will
continue
to
drink
on
the
reg
d
very
drinkable
for
being
7
and
63ibus
very
balanced
nice
mouthfeel
drinkability
as
stated
very
smooth
and
hoppy
a
smooth
drink
this
feels
like
two
brothers
are
working
together
to
create
the
perfect
drink
one
brother
is
named
hops
and
the
other
brother
is
named
smoothness
and
its
like
they
high
fived
each
other
to
create
this
sweet
concoction
of
a
beer
beer
pours
out
a
root
beer
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
it
looks
impressive
and
enticing
the
smell
is
quite
bold
with
resinous
grapefruit
hops
and
some
underlying
sweetness
from
the
malts
perhaps
a
touch
of
spiciness
from
the
rye
ahh
the
taste
is
long
citric
hops
with
a
touch
of
dryness
and
sharpness
from
the
malts
not
sweet
at
all
lots
of
residual
hops
in
the
aftertaste
and
again
that
spicinous
that
i
love
from
a
good
rye
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
slightly
oily
from
the
hops
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
had
my
local
liquor
store
bring
this
in
and
when
i
saw
the
price
tag
i
said
i
would
only
be
buying
one
six
pack
well
this
is
number
two
drinkability
is
high
everything
i
love
about
the
style
and
overall
an
awesome
brew
i
really
do
wish
it
was
getting
more
attention
then
their
domain
dupage
which
although
almost
as
good
does
not
have
the
unique
personality
and
flavor
to
itself
like
this
beer
does
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
rye
beer
i
liked
how
the
caramel
malts
and
rye
mixed
together
with
the
citrus
and
pine
hops
a
good
interesting
beer
id
certainly
have
again
drinkability
a
solid
beer
and
one
whose
scores
i
keep
upwardly
revising
as
the
glass
progresses
it
starts
smooth
and
i
do
not
pick
up
on
all
of
the
flavors
but
as
i
am
able
to
drink
more
and
dissect
the
flavors
i
like
it
even
better
schwinggg
f
a
f
a
this
beer
is
frickin
awesome
probably
my
favorite
beer
to
date
the
color
is
a
clear
amber
beauty
the
smell
is
hoppycirus
with
something
special
that
special
is
thai
palm
sugar
no
less
the
7
abv
is
balanced
beautifully
with
hops
rye
caramel
malt
and
thai
palm
sugar
the
head
is
nicewhite
with
a
perfect
lace
to
follow
this
beer
is
worht
your
younger
sisters
virginity
high
abv
may
scare
some
from
a
session
stand
point
trust
me
after
five
tap
servings
i
still
want
more
yummy
yummy
jesse
thanks
for
having
your
reception
at
2
bros
stay
thirsty
my
friends
d
its
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
with
the
high
alcohol
and
the
intense
bitterness
but
i
love
this
beer
for
its
rye
flavor
and
uniqueness
it
really
stands
out
and
if
it
was
readily
available
here
it
would
be
my
goto
for
a
dipa
yes
its
that
wellhopped
also
if
you
get
the
chance
the
brewery
and
the
tour
are
both
a
great
experience
conclusion
this
had
a
lively
refreshing
taste
and
i
would
defiantly
revisit
it
again
m
medium
to
thick
body
chewy
lightly
carbonated
d
this
was
a
good
rye
beer
not
one
that
i
think
i
would
revisit
but
the
rye
flavors
are
very
pronounced
and
it
was
worth
a
try
d
i
think
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
but
i
just
expected
a
little
more
from
this
beer
it
is
good
and
all
but
i
just
wish
the
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
overall
its
a
good
beer
it
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
among
some
of
the
other
rye
beers
ive
had
drinkability
interesting
and
solid
beer
wortth
seeking
very
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
backing
up
the
flavor
yet
not
really
detracting
from
the
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
me
want
more
with
every
drink
d
i
like
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
if
it
were
locally
available
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
via
trade
if
youre
looking
for
an
odd
style
that
remains
accessible
then
this
is
probably
the
beer
for
you
a
dark
sweetness
anchors
the
unique
sensation
associated
with
using
a
rye
malt
yielding
a
complex
but
balanced
beer
with
a
high
alcohol
content
this
beer
might
not
be
for
everyone
but
its
a
greattasting
example
of
an
uncommon
style
thats
worth
trying
the
7
abv
is
masked
completely
and
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
havent
liked
too
many
beers
from
this
brewery
but
they
are
local
so
i
keep
trying
their
stuff
i
think
this
is
their
best
brew
ive
had
yet
still
for
the
price
of
this
6
pack
there
are
a
lot
of
other
options
and
it
will
be
hard
to
pick
this
one
again
when
im
looking
at
a
good
shelf
craft
selection
very
drinkable
if
not
for
the
alcohol
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
one
of
my
favorite
two
brothers
beers
d
great
beer
by
two
brothers
probably
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
by
them
check
this
one
out
not
to
be
chugged
solid
beer
but
very
straight
forward
drinkability
is
ok
but
if
the
flavors
are
hit
and
miss
bottle
to
bottle
it
will
not
be
a
staple
in
my
house
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
as
i
previously
stated
the
marriage
of
the
rye
malts
and
the
hop
profile
chosen
here
is
well
done
i
would
definitely
be
willing
to
have
this
beer
again
another
time
deep
clear
brown
color
whole
thing
has
a
reddish
tint
tannish
cream
colored
ring
around
edge
of
glass
a
few
bubbles
and
spotting
on
the
face
of
the
beer
very
hoppy
aroma
mixed
well
with
a
sweet
matly
aroma
quite
a
pleasant
and
settling
aroma
very
balanced
nose
is
slightly
stuffed
up
so
this
could
be
completely
wrong
but
still
smell
really
good
through
a
stuffed
up
nose
moderate
to
high
carbonation
sweet
start
malty
rye
middle
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
coming
through
in
the
end
dry
finish
finish
seems
to
be
a
combination
of
malt
and
hop
not
an
intense
aftertaste
almost
grapey
finishes
clean
and
light
beer
feels
heavier
in
middle
of
drink
and
much
lighter
after
swallow
sweetness
increases
with
warmth
as
well
as
the
apperance
of
the
alcohol
but
still
well
hidden
in
flavor
overall
it
is
a
good
balance
in
aroma
and
flavor
of
malt
and
hop
might
be
one
of
my
new
favorite
red
ryes
had
on
tap
at
2
brothers
brew
pub
looks
very
tasty
in
the
glass
deep
brown
color
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
come
through
very
strongly
in
this
beer
rye
bread
is
very
prominent
and
accurate
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
salty
mix
i
love
this
beer
went
very
well
with
muffalotta
sandwich
cane
and
abel
has
an
upfront
malt
profile
but
the
the
rye
and
hops
clash
for
a
red
smoky
for
a
red
ale
would
not
session
the
hoppy
aroma
is
misleading
to
an
extent
but
overall
the
beer
tastes
very
good
pours
dark
but
also
pours
slightly
thin
i
could
certainly
try
another
of
these
but
its
defintely
not
my
favorite
rye
offering
i
was
pretty
exciting
for
this
beer
but
was
kinda
letdown
to
be
honest
overall
i
like
it
it
doesnt
stand
out
for
me
but
i
still
enjoyed
drinking
it
d
very
nice
overall
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
very
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
really
enjoyed
this
one
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
really
want
to
try
more
from
two
brothers
poured
into
a
goblet
thin
head
with
lacing
all
around
a
very
deep
red
color
with
a
piny
nose
body
is
thin
good
amount
of
hop
presence
but
in
a
nice
balance
not
too
overpowering
the
spice
of
the
rye
and
sweetness
of
the
palm
sugars
add
complexity
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
overall
i
like
this
one
i
like
rye
bread
and
i
think
that
the
rye
was
well
transferred
into
the
flavour
its
a
very
original
engaging
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
returning
to
recommended
with
an
interesting
balance
of
flavors
this
brew
is
definitely
one
to
try
out
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
it
but
boy
did
it
throw
me
for
a
loop
with
its
unique
sweet
n
spiciness
a
beer
i
would
gladly
revisit
if
given
the
chance
d
pretty
drinkable
interesting
mix
of
flavors
nothing
really
turns
me
off
in
this
beer
but
there
isnt
much
that
wows
me
either
worth
trying
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
but
i
dont
see
myself
seeking
it
out
this
is
my
favorite
two
brothers
beer
to
date
the
complexity
in
its
smell
and
taste
rocks
and
the
experience
drinking
this
beer
is
just
all
around
enjoyable
it
smells
like
citrus
and
pine
the
body
is
huge
and
the
flavors
well
like
i
said
i
seem
to
find
something
new
every
time
i
swear
i
detected
a
note
of
cantaloupe
in
the
last
one
this
is
a
big
bitter
fruity
and
delicious
beer
a
great
way
to
introduce
a
newbie
to
ipas
because
it
doesnt
smack
you
in
the
face
drink
its
nice
to
see
what
a
subtle
yet
interesting
aspect
rye
can
bring
to
a
beer
when
handled
with
skill
and
a
light
touch
cane
ebel
take
a
break
from
their
historically
antagonistic
qualities
and
work
together
wonderfully
in
this
beer
its
all
very
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
d
high
great
balance
of
hops
rye
and
maltiness
not
at
all
boozy
feeling
for
7
abv
almost
sessionable
if
it
were
a
little
less
alcoholic
i
could
and
often
do
get
pretty
tipsy
on
this
if
im
not
careful
a
great
beer
and
reasonably
priced
d
this
is
a
great
rye
ale
many
layers
of
complexities
and
s
great
taste
that
has
you
coming
back
for
more
i
find
this
to
be
a
really
drinkable
brew
for
the
autumn
season
as
it
brings
out
nice
semismokey
flavors
and
hold
a
nice
roasted
nutty
finish
well
hidden
abv
and
oh
so
smooth
i
had
one
at
the
beginning
of
departmental
happy
hour
and
wanted
to
go
back
for
a
second
but
they
were
all
gone
when
i
looked
around
later
am
going
to
enjoy
buying
my
own
and
maybe
updating
this
review
with
something
even
more
substantial
this
beer
is
the
highlight
of
the
variety
24
pack
from
costco
and
a
long
time
go
to
beer
i
was
pleased
when
they
added
it
to
their
year
round
lineup
and
switched
it
from
four
to
six
pack
without
increasing
the
price
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
i
have
had
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
rye
pale
ales
something
i
highly
recommend
drinkability
its
a
nice
beer
i
had
1
my
companion
had
3
this
one
is
really
dependent
on
what
you
taste
and
how
the
character
hits
you
im
big
on
smells
and
didnt
find
the
aroma
of
this
beer
quite
as
pleasing
as
other
ryes
ive
tried
its
a
solid
beer
and
would
try
again
as
a
sum
of
its
components
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
maybe
not
a
great
session
beer
but
i
would
like
to
go
have
another
one
right
now
overall
this
is
a
very
servicable
rye
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
is
a
great
option
when
you
want
to
have
a
solidly
crafted
beer
without
needing
to
over
analyze
it
for
any
reason
a
few
of
these
on
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
your
favorite
football
team
would
be
perfect
drinkability
depends
on
do
i
want
another
i
dont
really
want
another
one
unless
its
much
fresher
notice
u
didnt
mention
anything
about
any
rye
characteristics
thats
because
i
didnt
get
any
i
think
im
going
to
leave
this
on
my
wants
list
for
now
and
rereview
it
in
the
future
i
do
have
the
appropriate
glassware
after
all
of
course
it
might
be
unfair
that
i
am
mentally
comparing
it
to
2
week
old
reds
rye
p
a
that
beer
was
phenomenal
i
dont
think
this
beer
can
possibly
rival
one
of
founders
best
but
i
do
think
bottle
date
might
make
a
difference
this
is
now
my
third
rye
ipared
ale
founders
red
rye
and
summit
india
rye
being
the
other
two
and
this
is
simply
a
substyle
i
truly
enjoy
like
the
black
ipa
or
whatever
we
are
now
calling
it
this
almost
deserves
its
own
style
now
since
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
other
tamer
rye
beers
out
there
i
guess
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
or
reds
id
be
lost
the
price
sticker
would
be
the
decision
maker
drinkable
yes
it
is
a
bit
filling
for
its
typerather
tastynot
to
big
and
boozybut
the
shortage
of
carbonation
put
me
off
a
bit
this
was
great
it
was
one
of
the
few
beers
that
really
hit
when
taking
a
first
swig
and
id
love
to
have
this
again
do
for
a
7abv
brew
any
style
this
drinks
incredible
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
tried
in
the
last
year
if
i
could
get
this
any
time
it
would
be
my
goto
beer
i
like
trying
as
many
beers
as
possible
so
for
me
to
go
to
a
large
beer
store
in
the
hopes
of
finding
something
hyped
or
new
then
see
this
and
be
ecstatic
well
whatever
that
means
automatically
makes
two
brothers
one
of
my
favorites
and
the
fact
that
its
brewed
just
over
an
hour
away
is
awesome
absolutely
delicious
i
may
try
some
again
in
the
winter
with
it
warm
to
room
temp
dsuperbly
drinkable
beer
a
shame
i
only
had
one
kudos
to
my
buddy
gabor
the
beer
man
at
penn
station
for
introducing
me
to
this
one
i
have
never
seen
it
before
a
great
fall
transition
brew
im
going
to
look
this
one
up
again
if
i
can
find
it
it
has
the
full
bodied
flavor
of
a
much
bigger
beer
and
while
it
is
no
wimp
in
the
abv
category
you
would
never
know
it
utterly
superb
d
easy
drinking
not
entirely
smooth
quick
hop
burstdeep
malt
but
the
transition
is
enjoyable
definitely
enjoy
one
before
during
and
after
dinner
truly
an
enjoyable
beverage
poured
a
gorgeous
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
aroma
is
super
dry
with
nice
citric
hoppage
and
some
caramel
malt
taste
was
super
hoppy
with
a
rye
twinge
that
could
be
mistaken
for
an
astringent
cleaner
this
is
fairly
bitter
feel
is
prickly
from
the
amount
of
carbonation
not
super
drinkable
but
i
enjoyed
this
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
as
part
of
a
sampler
a
bright
clear
dark
copper
with
amber
highlights
lightly
clear
a
light
tan
head
great
retention
and
lacing
light
malts
on
the
aroma
but
mostly
hops
you
can
tell
its
totally
dry
hopped
taste
is
is
rye
undertones
with
lots
of
hops
throughout
the
hops
mostly
cover
up
everything
makes
it
taste
pretty
good
if
you
like
hops
decently
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
all
around
a
good
brew
a
dense
head
medium
brown
to
amber
in
color
a
few
spots
of
foam
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
4
25
s
hearty
aroma
that
is
heavy
on
the
malts
with
a
solid
dose
of
brown
sugar
thick
tangerine
and
papaya
hops
provide
a
nice
citrus
punch
and
some
earthy
touches
very
inviting
nose
though
i
didnt
pick
up
any
rye
4
50
t
some
caramelized
sugars
plums
and
prunes
solid
hop
bite
matched
with
an
equally
impressive
shot
of
malts
a
good
bit
of
grapefruit
rye
malts
are
less
prominent
than
expected
elements
of
a
double
ipa
4
50
m
heavy
mouth
feel
quite
smooth
4
50
d
a
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
beer
i
wish
this
one
was
available
in
my
local
market
as
i
can
definitely
see
it
becoming
part
of
my
regular
rotation
4
50
this
is
a
pretty
solid
ripa
that
id
be
happy
to
pick
up
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
distributed
in
my
area
t
it
has
a
very
nice
vegetable
malt
taste
clear
rye
in
the
back
its
smooth
but
with
a
slight
floralbitter
bite
i
gotta
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
hasnt
tried
it
yet
it
blew
my
mind
d
i
could
certainly
try
another
of
these
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
after
the
day
i
had
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
a
tasty
rye
beer
d
very
intriguing
beer
not
sure
how
big
of
a
fan
i
am
of
a
rye
beer
it
is
drinkable
as
there
is
a
good
mix
of
flavors
however
i
tend
to
enjoy
hoppier
beers
but
for
the
style
a
good
drink
i
was
lucky
enough
to
grab
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
black
sparrow
in
lafayette
in
it
poured
a
reddish
brown
almost
an
amber
with
light
white
head
it
smelled
sweet
and
of
rye
malts
and
almost
had
a
piny
hoppiness
to
it
almost
had
a
candied
fruit
flavor
to
it
it
tasted
great
it
was
a
good
balanace
of
the
rye
malt
hops
and
sweetness
kind
of
fruity
it
was
full
bodied
and
left
a
sweet
after
taste
it
was
drinkable
but
id
only
have
a
couple
at
a
time
it
had
good
flavor
and
was
a
very
good
beer
d
i
would
drink
these
all
night
maybe
im
just
not
a
rye
fan
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
at
all
i
actually
poured
out
half
of
the
bottle
skip
it
overall
another
solid
offering
from
the
brothers
at
two
brothers
d
the
beer
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
try
one
of
these
again
to
sample
the
interesting
mix
of
flavors
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
pours
a
slightly
hazed
reddish
brown
spotty
head
at
best
with
minimal
lacing
scent
is
a
pleasant
combination
of
spice
and
citrus
with
a
solid
sweet
but
not
overpowering
bready
and
carmely
background
first
sip
is
predominately
mild
spice
and
tropical
fruits
the
spice
intensifies
as
it
warms
yet
the
citrusy
hop
presence
fades
slightly
the
sweet
and
bready
carmely
background
does
not
come
through
until
the
beer
is
almost
at
room
temperature
medium
bodied
slight
touches
of
oilyness
but
also
slightly
watery
in
the
begining
im
torn
had
some
good
charachtertistics
to
it
but
tastes
rather
uneven
and
flat
on
some
sips
pours
a
clean
reddish
to
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
hops
rye
and
a
sweeter
malt
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
dry
rye
and
some
piney
hops
a
hoppy
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
rye
and
pine
hop
aftertaste
nice
balance
hops
to
rye
and
sweet
to
dry
real
freakin
good
d
pleasing
and
easy
enough
to
down
despite
a
7
strength
when
allowed
to
warm
the
drinkability
increases
its
a
curious
thing
that
the
warming
actually
wanes
and
the
result
seems
more
sessionable
as
nice
as
id
hope
for
and
a
beer
id
look
for
again
pours
a
deep
red
with
minimal
head
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
slightly
layer
of
retention
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
when
i
popped
the
top
on
this
one
i
got
a
big
hop
whiff
from
the
bottle
would
have
only
predicted
that
from
reading
the
label
but
awesome
nonetheless
smells
of
hops
rye
some
candied
sugar
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
really
nice
tastes
is
hoppy
from
the
getgo
but
fades
into
that
rye
malt
quickly
with
a
bit
of
sugar
and
sweetness
to
boot
bit
of
a
dry
finish
but
a
quite
a
good
mouthfeel
on
the
whole
drinkability
is
good
could
have
a
couple
of
these
given
the
opportunity
my
glass
disappeared
quite
quick

upon
revisiting
august
2010
does
not
disappoint
upon
revisiting
rather
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
the
2bros
and
am
enjoying
this
beer
immensely
d
on
a
hot
day
such
as
today
i
kept
reaching
for
this
one
regularly
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
is
a
very
nice
hoppy
rye
beer
with
nice
subtle
flavors
i
enjoy
how
different
this
beer
is
and
how
it
is
presented
on
my
palate
thank
you
dim
for
getting
me
this
beer
thanks
so
much
for
this
one
jim
it
was
very
much
enjoyed
i
found
cane
ebel
to
be
a
satisfying
somewhat
genrestraddling
beer
its
easy
drinking
and
does
a
lot
of
things
well
drinkability
another
winner
from
the
two
brothers
brewery
i
also
enjoy
their
domaine
dupage
french
style
country
ale
quite
a
bit
this
was
an
easy
beer
to
session
with
i
was
only
slightly
disappointed
that
it
came
in
a
four
pack
and
not
a
six
pack
because
i
immediately
wanted
more
d
this
is
a
great
brew
and
at
a
new
price
there
is
a
good
chance
this
beer
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
previously
reviewed
the
cask
version
and
loved
that
the
bottled
version
is
nearly
as
good
just
lacks
some
of
the
nuances
i
picked
up
in
the
cask
version
overall
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
overall
since
i
know
very
little
about
rye
beer
i
did
enjoy
this
and
would
drink
it
again
good
dessert
beer
good
anytime
beer
really
this
beer
gets
better
as
time
goes
on
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
be
happy
poured
a
dark
brownishred
with
a
nice
stable
head
with
good
lacing
and
some
yeast
sediment
floating
around
smells
like
toffee
toasted
caramel
malts
with
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
waves
of
rye
hops
and
caramel
malts
flow
through
to
palate
with
some
good
bitterness
at
the
end
very
good
balance
of
ingredients
it
has
a
nice
creamy
chewy
mouthfeel
a
very
yummy
well
made
brew
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
a
little
oily
in
a
good
way
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
little
overpowering
to
consume
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
very
interesting
and
very
tasty
drinks
very
spicy
from
the
nose
one
would
expect
to
get
a
very
pungent
bitter
hit
from
the
hopsand
theyre
certainly
therebut
the
balance
is
pretty
impressive
big
round
spice
with
some
caramel
in
the
malt
but
the
floral
grapefruity
hops
wipe
the
malt
away
ce
drinks
big
but
i
wouldnt
have
been
opposed
to
having
another
one
or
two
over
the
course
of
an
evening
its
just
so
wellbalanced
im
very
impressed
d
very
tasty
smooth
and
enjoyable
could
definitely
have
more
than
one
drinkability
is
mediumhigh
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
not
a
super
high
abv
so
i
could
see
having
a
couple
of
these
this
is
the
kind
of
playfully
inventive
beer
id
like
to
see
more
of
from
the
brothers
ebel
well
done
the
body
was
decent
perhaps
a
bit
thin
drinkability
was
good
id
have
more
of
these
if
they
were
local
to
me
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
m
d
smooth
medium
body
carbonated
rather
nicely
with
a
little
stickiness
on
the
finish
its
a
very
easy
drinker
especially
considering
the
7
abv
which
is
very
well
hidden
though
the
spicy
character
of
the
rye
could
also
be
muting
the
peppery
or
similarly
spicelike
qualities
of
the
alcohol
i
was
shocked
at
just
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
plan
to
pick
up
another
pack
to
take
home
excellent
stuff
very
similar
to
the
cask
version
d
you
can
most
certainly
to
more
than
one
or
two
very
nice
d
easily
my
favorite
rye
beer
one
whiff
of
this
stuff
had
my
mouth
watering
nicely
balanced
and
goes
down
smooth
this
is
a
winner
overall
i
liked
cane
and
ebel
but
not
as
much
as
some
rye
beers
that
i
have
had
not
sure
if
i
can
contribute
this
to
the
best
by
date
or
not
id
like
to
rereview
a
fresh
bottle
so
that
i
can
be
a
little
more
comprehensive
d
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
few
times
before
but
i
cant
think
of
a
single
time
ive
had
two
pints
in
a
row
dpretty
easy
drinking
but
not
very
interesting
to
my
palate
decent
flavor
couldnt
really
have
more
than
one
though
really
thick
i
think
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
be
beneficial
to
this
beer
and
make
it
easier
to
drink
drinkability
not
too
shabby
would
definitely
recommend
and
drink
again
d
very
drinkable
rye
style
i
thought
it
wasnt
over
the
top
with
rye
flavor
but
a
good
beer
for
someone
to
have
that
wants
to
get
into
the
style
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
2
or
3
of
these
before
going
onto
something
else
this
ale
pours
brilliantly
clear
deep
red
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
moderatehigh
hopscitrus
floral
and
spicy
sweet
malt
emerges
beneath
the
hops
as
well
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
initially
citrus
and
pine
hop
then
sweet
caramel
malt
before
a
smooth
but
very
evident
hop
bitterness
emerge
the
body
is
mediumfull
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
flavorful
beer
obviously
hoppy
but
still
good
malt
presence
there
is
just
a
hint
of
the
abv
but
7
it
is
well
hidden
recommendworth
picking
up
a
4
pack
d
this
beer
is
great
my
favorite
rye
so
far
i
am
trying
to
take
my
time
with
it
but
find
it
disappearing
fast
it
has
an
excellent
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
and
superb
mouthfeel
id
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
lived
where
it
was
available
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
sometime
d
good
smoooth
and
perhaps
a
tad
heavy
perfect
compliment
to
my
dinner
dthis
is
actually
pretty
tasty
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
brings
a
nice
hop
profile
for
a
rye
beer
definitely
give
it
a
shot
had
this
beer
on
cask
at
d
b
a
on
the
lower
east
side
of
manhattan
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cask
ales
but
i
always
try
it
because
well
im
not
sure
why
this
one
was
a
real
surprise
the
flavor
was
awesome
and
there
was
a
spicy
bitterness
that
helped
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
carbonation
that
tends
to
accompany
cask
ales
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
in
a
bottle
overall
thought
it
would
be
worse
d
extremely
tasty
and
very
drinkable
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
two
brothers
and
that
is
saying
something
d
at
7
this
is
a
really
mellow
drinkable
brew
so
tasty
and
so
satisfying
crisp
layered
and
rewarding
best
rye
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
d
i
am
on
my
third
so
what
does
that
tell
you
the
feel
is
medium
but
is
a
really
smooth
feeling
beer
when
it
goes
down
it
is
a
bit
warming
at
first
but
not
hot
or
too
boozy
a
pretty
good
hopped
up
red
ale
mouthfeel
is
great
i
like
it
because
it
definitely
is
nice
and
light
feeling
making
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
overall
probably
one
of
my
favorite
rye
beers
of
all
time
impeccably
balanced
and
full
of
a
great
diversity
of
flavors
simpy
an
excellent
beer
must
try
for
midwesters
or
any
rye
beer
lover
d
definitely
a
unique
beer
and
very
tasty
a
notch
below
hop
rod
on
my
rye
hierarchy
but
an
excellent
beer
no
question
overall
really
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
i
will
remember
it
fondly

brewed
with
rye
palm
sugar
and
summit
hops
dryhopped
with
simcoe
the
brew
is
a
chillhazed
cherry
red
capped
with
a
thin
layer
of
froth
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
you
can
smell
the
age
malts
on
this
brew
but
notes
of
caramel
malts
and
sticky
hops
pierce
through
and
help
deliver
a
satisfactory
aroma
lots
of
resinycitric
hops
on
the
palate
with
a
good
backing
of
sweet
crystal
malts
and
a
medium
to
high
bitterness
there
is
also
some
fruityfloral
alcohol
and
a
light
peppery
note
but
not
really
a
whole
lot
of
rye
it
has
a
medium
body
and
finish
and
the
sugar
helps
to
keep
this
brew
from
being
too
heavy
in
all
a
nice
hoppy
and
malty
brew
but
the
rye
and
palm
sugar
dont
really
stick
out
at
all
maybe
they
come
through
a
bit
more
when
fresh
poured
copper
amber
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
but
decent
lacing
the
smell
revealed
ryecaraway
seeds
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
some
pine
the
taste
did
reveal
a
nice
ryemalt
balance
but
there
was
a
lingering
sweetness
midpalate
maybe
overripe
orange
it
made
for
a
disjointed
flavor
the
mouthfeel
did
have
a
nice
carbo
feel
to
it
combined
with
a
medium
body
for
me
a
sipping
beer
not
for
sessioning
the
hops
are
so
fresh
coming
out
of
this
great
rye
kick
ce
has
always
been
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
perhaps
just
a
little
slow
feeling
i
would
have
thought
the
palm
sugar
or
whatever
would
dry
it
outperhaps
they
compensate
by
mashing
hot
its
clearly
not
what
it
is
when
it
is

still
a
fantastic

try
this
again
summary
hated
this
one
at
first
but
different
tastes
started
popping
out
everytime
i
took
a
sip
very
unique
flavor
to
this
one
i
will
probably
be
drinking
this
one
agian
this
beer
had
great
balance
a
good
flavorful
malt
backbone
stood
up
well
to
a
strong
hop
bitterness
d
as
good
if
not
slightly
better
than
the
bottled
version
but
its
hard
to
battle
the
tastiness
of
a
cask
but
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
year
round
offerings
from
one
of
the
best
and
friendliest
breweries
around
d
nice
hoppy
brew
that
is
fairly
well
balanced
definitely
quite
drinkable
and
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
to
enjoy
good
drinkability
but
not
great
solid
complex
beer
this
beer
is
great
the
rye
malt
comes
through
as
the
dominant
flavor
there
is
a
slight
roast
at
the
back
end
there
is
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
this
is
a
great
great
beer
i
would
expect
the
adjunct
sugar
to
dry
it
out
or
thin
up
the
beer
but
it
is
full
bodied
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
really
high
if
you
like
ryes
go
get
this
beer
thanks
naugled
i
love
it
d
pretty
good
rye
beer
the
flavor
is
awesome
the
look
and
mouthfeel
are
sub
par
to
average
the
smell
is
decent
as
well
clean
this
beer
up
and
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
you
can
make
overall
a
great
beer
from
two
brothers
i
can
see
why
this
is
their
flagship
beer
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
dark
copper
reddish
brown
aggressive
pour
yielded
about
1
5
fingers
khaki
head
that
dissipated
with
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
hoppy
some
fruit
not
all
citrus
taste
is
spicy
up
front
with
some
sweetness
in
back
kind
of
a
dry
finish
similar
to
a
barleywine
but
way
more
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
a
little
creamy
very
drinkable
for
7
definitely
would
buy
it
again
poured
a
redbrown
with
a
modest
head
that
reduced
to
a
skin
the
aroma
was
hops
bitter
the
taste
was
a
very
nice
balance
of
hoppy
bitter
and
malty
sweet
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
and
slightly
oily
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
cane
and
ebel
compares
very
favorably
with
founders
red
rye
m
the
carbonation
and
hops
balance
well
in
the
mouth
with
some
warming
from
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
this
beer
feels
a
bit
under
carbonated
wont
be
having
anymore
of
these
thanks
ill
stick
to
founders
terrapin
for
my
red
ale
needs
as
it
warms
the
interesting
flavors
of
the
thai
sugar
come
out
and
leave
a
nice
coating
on
the
tongue
but
i
cant
help
but
wish
for
a
little
salt
in
the
mix
with
all
of
these
bold
sweet
flavors
wow
sugary
at
first
then
it
gets
interesting
malts
everywhere
noticeable
sugar
sweetness
caramel
sugar
sweetness
brown
sugar
chocolate
there
moderatetofull
body
nice
silky
rye
character
bitterness
creeps
up
on
you
surprising
based
on
the
initial
sweetness
foam
clings
to
the
beer
to
the
tongue
to
the
glass
slightly
odd
sweetness
and
twang
on
the
finish
decent
little
beer
this
is
remarkably
smooth
clean
attractive
and
delicious
pretty
good
drinkability
but
nothing
special
in
my
book
probably
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
tasted
this
one
almost
a
year
beyond
its
best
by
date
perhaps
the
dates
really
do
mean
something
i
might
want
to
try
one
thats
a
bit
fresher
before
making
any
definitive
decisions
purchased
from
rays
liquors
in
wauwatosa
wi
i
found
a
best
by
date
of
42209
printed
on
the
bottle
shoot
poured
a
very
dark
red
body
with
no
head
but
a
few
swirls
gave
it
a
little
cap
aroma
is
of
spicy
and
grassy
hops
full
bodied
and
smooth
this
beer
has
a
big
roasted
caramel
flavor
with
a
little
bite
from
the
rye
great
peppery
hop
finish
after
each
sip
of
course
this
is
better
fresh
but
it
was
still
as
good
as
i
remember
the
first
time
i
tried
it
d
very
drinkable
the
glass
was
gone
before
i
even
realized
it
leaving
me
wanting
more
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
for
me
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
red
ryes
but
the
extra
hop
in
this
beer
intrigued
me
it
will
go
in
the
rotation
d
i
love
this
beer
i
love
it
even
more
on
cask
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
easier
than
out
of
the
bottle
d
one
or
two
tops
for
me
but
one
damn
good
brew
to
drink
in
a
session
all
systems
go
on
this
one
recommended
cane
ebel
is
highly
drinkable
with
ample
character
and
depth
this
one
is
suitable
for
occasions
with
friends
or
family
and
can
easily
stand
on
its
own
d
i
was
pretty
blown
away
the
hop
presence
in
this
rye
beer
it
is
by
far
my
favorite
two
brothers
offering
and
probably
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
out
there
d
maybe
being
in
the
city
of
my
youth
is
skewing
my
numbers
but
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
really
fine
beer
i
even
brought
a
few
bottles
of
it
home
with
me
hopefully
it
will
be
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
as
this
cask
conditioned
sample
was
pours
a
beautiful
deep
deep
amber
color
perfectly
clear
almost
mahogany
you
now
a
bit
of
brown
in
the
middle
with
a
huge
tannishoff
white
head
thats
about
2cm
stays
in
a
dense
little
disc
on
top
and
leaves
nice
lacing
really
a
beautiful
beer
the
smell
starts
a
bit
powdery
malty
and
sweet
backed
up
with
a
nice
light
toastroastiness
theres
a
nice
herbal
hoppy
smell
slightly
grassy
a
bit
floral
resinous
with
a
tiny
note
of
citrus
in
the
background
i
like
the
nice
spicy
smell
here
and
i
like
the
spicy
taste
it
comes
on
kind
of
quickly
after
the
initial
caramel
sweetness
you
get
a
nice
spiciness
both
kind
of
herbal
and
hoppy
and
from
the
rye
as
well
it
continues
feeling
almost
like
dry
cardaomom
a
note
of
black
pepper
a
hint
of
lemon
and
maybe
some
green
leafy
earthy
herbs
the
leafiness
continues
but
it
gets
a
bit
like
tea
just
with
some
malt
syrup
in
it
or
something
finishes
a
little
grassy
with
a
hint
of
some
roasted
kind
of
burnt
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
pretty
full
kind
of
on
the
full
side
of
medium
which
is
nice
for
this
not
too
sweet
not
too
dry
and
the
carbonation
provides
a
nice
little
tickle
good
balance
and
quite
interesting
the
drinkability
is
good
i
found
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
would
love
to
have
some
more
of
course
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
day
but
its
something
id
like
to
have
around
because
i
can
tell
i
might
have
cravings
for
a
beer
like
this
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
poored
a
dark
brown
caramel
color
not
going
to
lie
kind
thew
me
off
nose
was
kinda
weak
slight
hops
kinda
peak
thru
also
kinda
dissapointed
to
me
the
rye
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
not
bad
would
drink
it
again
and
probably
will
almost
more
like
a
ipa
than
a
rye
atleast
to
me
another
treat
picked
up
from
andersons
general
store
in
toledo
a
deep
dark
red
ale
bold
hop
flavors
with
a
decided
tang
from
rye
totally
different
from
other
rye
beers
that
ive
tried
but
not
as
flavorful
as
reds
rye
from
founders
however
this
is
still
a
really
nice
beer
one
id
love
to
try
on
cask
recommend
drinkability
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
with
subtle
and
nuanced
flavors
from
the
palm
sugar
d
a
great
rye
ipa
i
cant
imagine
many
hoppy
ryes
i
would
rather
have
the
fullness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
too
many
but
still
very
drinkable
and
one
i
consider
refreshing
for
the
strength
i
recommend
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
rye
beers
and
hops
it
wont
disappoint
in
either
respect
d
cane
and
ebel
is
easily
my
favorite
offering
from
two
brothers
the
aroma
of
this
beer
on
tap
was
beautiful
this
is
one
of
the
best
rye
beers
on
the
market
in
my
opinion
went
well
with
a
bowl
full
of
fresh
cherries
d
hop
stoopid
kicked
just
before
i
arrived
but
you
know
what
this
kicks
hop
stoopid
in
the
pants
9
times
out
of
10
i
love
rye
and
i
love
hops
and
this
beer
provides
both
in
tall
order
d
i
could
go
for
another
12
oz
but
probably
have
to
change
it
up
after
that
excellent
flavor
just
really
rich
this
beer
pours
a
deep
rubyamber
color
with
one
finger
of
tan
creamy
head
decent
head
retention
and
leaves
sheets
of
lacing
behind
nose
is
of
citrusy
hops
nice
caramel
malts
some
grassy
hops
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
taste
is
of
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
up
front
moving
in
to
some
grains
and
grassiness
rye
comes
through
towards
the
finish
hops
are
detectable
here
and
there
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
beer
medium
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
definitely
a
dryer
beer
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
the
creativity
of
the
style
and
i
think
they
used
some
interesting
ingredients
bold
clever
and
creative
good
overall
beer
got
this
in
a
mix
12
pack
and
not
sure
i
will
drink
the
other
one
just
not
impressed
the
sugar
cane
after
taste
is
just
too
much
very
sweet
not
a
fan
but
always
worth
trying
something
different
never
had
a
beer
made
with
thai
palm
sugar
oh
well
drinkability
quite
drinkable
flavors
are
memorable
but
not
too
powerful
in
any
department
drinkability
a
nice
beer
i
would
happily
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
with
any
summer
meal
cherry
amber
with
a
fine
sudsy
head
that
leaves
fine
lace
behind
as
it
melts
the
nose
is
pure
fruityhoppy
goodness
with
butterscotch
spiced
malt
notes
tons
of
fresh
hoppiness
spicy
caraway
seed
and
caramel
malt
balance
perfectly
together
to
create
a
really
tasty
beverage
smoothand
kind
of
sticky
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
makes
this
beer
go
down
quickly
a
top
notch
beer
overall
i
am
really
liking
this
beer
i
am
curious
to
know
what
the
hop
level
would
have
been
like
had
i
tried
this
when
it
was
first
released
i
am
not
disappointed
with
this
brew
at
all
i
could
easily
drink
another
in
a
night
it
had
some
unique
ingredients
going
on
and
it
was
neat
to
be
able
to
try
them
d
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
a
sixer
of
this
i
ended
up
giving
the
other
from
the
12
sample
pack
to
my
dad
to
drink
at
least
i
have
the
bottle
for
home
brewing
d
pretty
good
drinkability
for
a
7
beer
a
couple
is
about
all
i
could
do
of
this
would
like
to
compare
this
to
a
fresh
bottle
as
i
really
enjoy
this
style
drinkability
moderate
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
in
terms
of
complexity
or
balance
but
still
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
d
good
but
i
wish
it
was
fresh
this
is
my
first
beer
from
two
brothers
but
i
hope
it
wont
be
last
i
havent
been
able
to
find
it
here
in
cincinnati
more
trips
to
chicago
overall
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
plan
to
revisit
soon
if
i
do
id
love
to
compare
it
to
a
fresher
version
note
after
several
bottles
of
this
fine
brew
it
should
be
noted
that
the
fresher
the
better
while
still
solid
this
one
loses
a
little
something
as
the
weeks
pass
my
rating
takes
into
account
that
variability
medium
body
with
smooth
light
syrupy
moments
and
resins
in
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
is
lightly
prickly
upfront
this
beer
was
kind
of
old
so
the
hoppiness
is
probably
more
intense
than
i
felt
nonetheless
or
perhaps
because
of
that
it
is
a
good
beer
too
bad
i
could
not
notice
more
rye
but
perhaps
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
this
beer
was
recommended
and
it
far
exceeded
expectations
great
stuff
this
beer
is
also
available
from
the
two
brothers
tap
house
on
cask
pour
fridays
and
saturdays
i
had
this
on
cask
and
its
even
better
but
currently
im
drinking
it
from
the
bottle
its
a
deep
reddish
brown
in
color
clear
with
a
light
cream
head
the
aroma
is
definitely
of
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
refreshing
citrusy
flavor
from
the
hops
and
a
roasted
malty
afterfinish
it
has
a
hint
of
warming
alcohol
actually
its
hard
to
detect
the
rye
malt
wonderful
beer
though
very
drinkable
even
better
on
cask
overall
a
pleasing
beer
but
you
must
be
in
the
mood
for
a
stronger
darker
flavor
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
overall
its
passable
there
are
many
other
beers
id
rather
drink
but
this
one
was
fine
id
like
to
try
a
different
bottle
to
see
if
mine
was
off
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
hazy
rich
apricot
color
with
about
an
inch
of
light
ecru
colored
sticky
foam
moderate
lacing
sticks
to
the
inside
of
my
glass
with
each
sip
smells
and
tastes
of
rich
spicy
caramelized
malts
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
bready
grains
and
a
touch
of
resinous
pine
a
notch
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
looking
forward
to
getting
more
when
it
becomes
available
check
this
one
out
if
you
see
it
drinkability
its
not
a
session
beer
at
7
but
again
if
you
like
the
hops
im
sure
youll
find
yourself
quaffing
a
few
i
have
got
to
admit
that
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
rye
beers
so
im
not
too
sure
how
to
review
this
one
it
looked
good
with
a
lively
pour
and
darker
amber
color
the
head
was
minimal
but
stuck
solidly
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
mostly
piney
hops
with
a
maltybready
combo
solid
hoppy
taste
coupled
with
a
punch
of
sugary
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
distinct
grainy
dryness
time
to
try
more
ryes
i
loved
it
and
will
for
sure
pick
up
another
4pk
in
the
future
the
feel
is
smooth
but
with
medium
body
a
little
bite
at
the
end
not
bad
but
just
a
strange
metallic
taste
that
overshadows
the
rest
too
much
lacquer
d
as
noted
before
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
making
it
an
easy
drinker
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
ive
had
this
beer
in
a
bottle
previously
and
it
was
far
less
impressed
as
it
was
not
nearly
as
lively
as
this
however
todays
beer
is
exhibiting
a
greater
complexity
and
obvious
freshness
that
was
not
present
in
my
original
tasting
quite
a
drinkable
beer
very
tasty
and
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
back
to
back
i
have
a
feeling
this
will
be
a
great
summer
beer
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
when
it
gets
warmer

while
the
boldness
and
relative
heaviness
of
the
beer
prevents
me
from
chugging
it
down
id
gladly
drink
these
all
night
ive
been
craving
this
beer
before
getting
this
pack
and
while
hop
rod
rye
is
a
passable
substitute
and
great
beer
i
quickly
remembered
why
i
preferred
this
one
i
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
and
a
bit
more
affordable
but
anyone
who
can
get
it
needs
to
its
fantastic
right
now
and
even
better
nearer
to
peak
freshness
i
might
score
this
a
perfect
on
tap
its
that
good
this
beer
isnt
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
an
occasional
cane
ebel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
but
it
is
distinguished
by
the
cane
sugar
as
well
as
the
rye
flavors
from
the
grain
bill
the
combination
is
unusual
and
really
tasty
this
is
a
creative
brew
and
perhaps
the
best
offering
from
two
bros
and
i
like
quite
a
few
of
their
brews
their
outstanding
use
of
hops
in
this
one
makes
this
a
top
notch
rye
really
a
nice
drinker
very
solid
and
spicy
enough
to
help
the
intrigue
d
very
drinkable
each
sip
definitely
leaves
me
wanting
another
this
brew
would
be
a
great
early
evening
sipper
in
the
summer
as
the
sun
goes
down
after
a
good
barbecue
really
diggin
the
flavor
on
this
one
starts
off
with
a
juicy
burst
of
malty
sweetness
that
quickly
gives
way
to
a
balance
of
spicy
rye
and
fresh
floral
hops
the
spiciness
culminates
alongside
a
perfect
carbonation
level
across
the
back
of
the
palate
lending
a
nice
dryness
to
the
finish
and
although
the
body
is
on
the
slightly
thin
side
for
7
this
makes
for
a
highly
drinkable
brew
that
ill
surely
revisit
in
the
future
well
done
two
brothers
cane
ebel
easily
rivals
founders
red
rye
in
terms
of
taste
and
quality
drinkabilityvery
enjoyable
version
of
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
styles
i
will
definitely
grab
another
overall
impression
this
beer
is
definitely
my
favorite
that
two
brothers
has
to
offer
it
has
a
uniqueness
from
the
rye
and
palm
sugar
that
is
showcased
in
the
beer
its
really
a
unique
take
on
an
american
rye
ale
by
blending
the
peppery
spicyness
of
rye
with
the
sweet
citrus
spice
of
american
hops
its
a
definite
must
try
beer
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
second
go
round
with
this
beer
and
i
may
need
a
third
because
of
consistency
issues
i
thought
it
was
a
better
beer
than
what
im
drinking
d
its
great
to
see
this
one
in
the
year
round
category
from
two
brothers
something
i
enjoy
drinking
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
check
this
one
out
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
better
rye
beers
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
m
great
mouthfeel
somewhat
silky
and
thick
d
solid
the
sugar
notes
i
think
slow
this
beer
down
in
this
department
but
its
a
nice
tradeoff
in
the
flavor
department
pours
a
dark
brown
amber
with
nice
thick
lacing
and
a
nice
tan
head
smells
of
rye
and
dank
hops
nice
malty
flavor
and
hoppy
smoothness
smooth
medium
carbonation
finishes
nice
and
dry
new
to
the
style
but
this
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
recommended
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
poured
from
tap
into
10
oz
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
red
caramel
with
a
finger
of
head
good
retention
and
lacing
on
the
glass
very
caramellike
smell
taste
is
of
smooth
toasty
dark
malts
with
a
wheaty
rye
like
background
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
coats
the
tongue
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
another
great
brew
from
two
brothers
ill
definitely
add
this
to
to
the
list
of
beers
and
brewers
id
like
to
see
here
in
sc
seems
to
be
a
wellcrafted
beer
the
style
isnt
for
me
but
i
can
still
appreciate
the
quality
very
nice
beer
recommend
pours
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
rust
highlights
a
smallish
bubbly
tan
head
and
some
light
lacing
nice
hoppy
aroma
plenty
of
citrus
and
pine
notes
and
a
light
spiciness
flavor
is
on
par
with
the
nose
piney
hops
light
citrus
slightly
sweet
and
a
solid
rye
spiciness
along
coasting
along
nicely
with
some
toasty
bready
malts
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
really
enjoy
these
hopped
up
rye
beers
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
really
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
hop
flavors
d
ahhh
yeah
a
little
bit
more
expensive
than
there
other
beers
but
for
a
miss
priced
6
pack
i
think
1
75
per
bottle
is
well
worth
it
i
think
the
price
might
be
wrong
so
i
am
going
back
tomorrow
and
pick
up
some
more
hello
j
being
a
hophead
i
thought
this
beer
was
phenomenal
i
love
the
floral
and
citrusy
hops
and
it
had
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
this
a
very
balanced
beer
d
tastes
great
but
a
4pack
in
a
night
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
theres
so
much
flavor
its
tough
to
keep
drinking
pours
with
a
humongous
tight
fluffy
white
head
very
thick
hazy
chestnut
color
aromas
of
gingerbread
sweet
and
spicy
ginger
orange
peel
and
nutmeg
tastes
of
caramel
and
resin
spiced
rum
ginger
cinnamon
vanilla
nicely
bitter
hop
finish
and
spicy
aftertaste
medium
light
body
solid
effort
by
two
brothers
i
could
drink
this
again
not
sure
it
would
be
at
the
top
of
my
search
list
but
it
certainly
got
me
excited
for
my
rye
ale
in
primary
right
now
overall
a
great
tasting
beer
lots
of
bitterness
with
this
hoppy
red
ale
not
sure
what
to
look
for
out
of
thai
palm
sugar
but
interesting
nonetheless
t
incredibly
clean
and
crisp
all
the
way
through
nice
caramel
and
sharp
cranberry
flavors
great
hops
come
through
as
the
rye
kicks
to
end
this
beer
in
a
very
satisfying
manor
this
beer
is
very
sharp
and
refreshing
leaves
me
wanting
another
i
think
i
will
damn
solid
stuff
goes
down
great
at
first
but
catches
up
to
ya
after
the
first
glass
worht
every
sip
no
matter
how
ya
decide
to
drink
it
down
taste
is
strong
rye
with
a
with
a
nice
subtle
hop
finishnot
as
hoppy
as
other
ryes
ive
had
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
for
me
because
of
the
smooth
taste
although
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
muddy
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
inch
head
that
recedes
into
just
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
has
tons
of
rye
just
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
ton
of
rye
slight
bit
of
cascade
hops
and
just
a
bit
of
raisin
this
is
hands
down
the
ryest
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
it
really
tastes
like
a
marbled
rye
with
a
slice
of
grapefruit
put
on
top
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
finishes
quite
dry
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
that
had
a
bunch
of
rye
added
into
it
even
though
the
malted
rye
was
everywhere
it
never
got
boring
youd
think
with
all
the
malted
rye
that
this
beer
contained
it
would
get
boring
but
it
didnt
in
the
end
it
was
delicious
rye
ale
i
would
love
to
drink
this
again
and
in
fact
i
just
did
but
this
time
it
wasnt
in
a
little
12
oz
bottle
but
in
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
behold
the
power
of
the
rye
notes
i
have
not
liked
the
hoppy
hoppy
beers
in
the
past
but
if
they
continue
to
taste
like
this
a
mature
well
balanced
but
hoppy
beer
then
i
might
start
to
be
persuaded
into
the
hop
camp
d
decently
drinkable
pours
a
clear
brilliant
red
color
with
way
too
much
foamy
eggshell
colored
head
almost
looks
like
meringue
almost
everlasting
retention
yields
some
nice
spots
of
sticky
lacing
smells
of
rye
bread
caramel
malt
citrus
and
earthy
hops
with
a
touch
of
ethanol
tastes
of
caramel
and
rye
with
a
nice
touch
of
orange
lemon
and
grapefruit
zest
as
well
as
a
little
earthy
hop
presence
medium
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
fairly
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
good
hop
character
that
i
think
could
be
stronger
if
the
beer
was
a
little
fresher
according
to
the
bottle
its
best
if
drank
before
6192008
but
even
at
this
stage
in
the
game
its
pretty
darn
tasty
md
wonderfully
complex
without
pretension
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
nicely
layered
and
easily
quaffable
a
nicely
brewed
beer
well
done
mdboth
are
quite
high
as
the
carbonation
matches
well
with
the
spice
without
upsetting
the
balance
of
the
sweet
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
get
in
the
way
even
though
its
far
from
hiding
its
warmth
worth
trying
without
a
doubt
i
like
sixpoints
righteous
a
bit
better
only
because
i
like
my
ryes
a
little
dry
and
to
use
my
time
to
rhyme
but
this
ones
a
good
representative
of
the
style
d
i
love
a
good
rye
beer
this
was
a
real
treat
and
ill
certainly
look
for
more
this
is
ok
and
tastes
a
great
deal
like
stone
arrogant
bastard
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
great
thick
mouthfeel
like
i
was
actually
drinking
something
with
substance
almost
creamy
a
pleasure
to
drink
doesnt
feel
like
a
7
0
beer
i
think
ill
have
another
pours
a
relatively
clear
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
minimal
maybe
14
light
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
aroma
is
quite
subdued
some
light
rye
bread
a
bit
of
yeast
and
a
peppery
note
in
the
background
taste
is
really
quite
good
lots
of
rye
a
solid
but
not
dominant
hop
bitterness
some
perfumey
alcohol
near
the
finish
and
a
bit
of
spicyness
throughout
good
mouthfeel
mediumish
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
is
enjoyable
flavors
are
balanced
a
version
with
less
alcohol
would
probably
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
hv
overall
a
very
quality
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
bear
republic
hop
rod
rye
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
wonderfully
hoppy
brew
with
enough
malt
character
to
create
a
nice
balance
the
smooth
and
fresh
quality
of
the
draught
version
prevents
the
brew
from
becoming
overly
bitter
or
stale
on
the
palate
resulting
in
a
great
brew
that
is
quite
drinkable
cheers
d
nice
i
like
this
one
they
could
easily
bomber
this
one
it
is
that
enjoyable
thanks
eric
for
knocking
this
one
off
my
wants
good
beer
overall
would
certainly
like
to
try
the
imperial
version
overall
an
excellent
beer
id
like
to
have
again
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
a
very
dry
feel
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
begins
to
get
to
me
even
through
the
bitter
after
half
a
glass
its
still
a
pleasure
to
finish
but
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
if
there
was
a
bit
less
cloying
flavor
in
the
middle
d
very
nicely
balanced
red
ale
with
distinct
hop
flavor
pretty
drinkable
for
7
almost
a
session
beer
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
bitterness
d
this
is
a
very
fine
rye
beer
great
malt
and
hop
tastes
this
shows
a
dark
mahogany
red
color
with
a
hefty
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
sharp
lemony
pine
hops
and
deep
butterscotch
berry
the
flavor
brings
very
satiny
smooth
raspberry
malt
and
piney
hops
delicious
and
rich
with
a
very
consistent
and
smooth
carbonation
somewhat
like
a
mild
barleywine
it
has
a
slight
resinous
quality
which
hints
at
the
rye
taste
the
bitterness
gathers
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
theres
a
touch
of
dryness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
very
nice
and
distinctive
fairly
drinkable
for
sure
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
short
lived
cream
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
nice
toasted
caramel
malt
some
spicy
rye
and
hops
to
boot
the
taste
is
of
a
solid
caramel
malt
slightly
nutty
slightly
spicy
nicy
grassy
hops
to
compliment
the
malt
the
feel
is
moderate
chewy
semisoft
carbonation
finishes
with
a
bitter
twang
two
brothers
sure
do
know
how
to
make
an
excellent
malty
brew
this
brew
is
very
smooth
nice
rye
and
hop
spice
recommended
i
havent
had
many
rye
beers
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
so
far
it
pours
a
very
thick
somewhat
cloudy
tawny
brown
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
with
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
nice
balance
between
oily
hops
maltish
sweetness
some
florals
some
grassy
notes
too
the
taste
is
a
really
nice
treat
there
is
a
touch
of
thick
molasses
thick
grainy
breads
some
nice
sweet
malts
very
nice
estery
and
fruity
hops
some
grapefruity
acerbicness
this
beer
hits
all
the
right
notes
it
is
bitter
without
being
bittering
thick
without
being
syrupy
slightly
higher
on
the
abv
without
being
throaty
or
alcoholy
the
mouthfeel
is
slight
a
tad
drying
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
modest
lchaim
this
is
a
very
good
beer
bready
hoppy
lacy
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
the
smell
is
heavily
bready
lacing
on
the
glass
is
the
most
ive
ever
seen
now
that
im
looking
at
this
empty
glass
the
lacing
remains
all
the
way
up
to
the
top
its
incredible
the
feel
and
texture
is
perfectly
balanced
very
comforting
drink
drinkability
is
very
high
as
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
taste
is
initially
citrusy
and
hoppy
then
the
caramel
malt
backbone
comes
to
smooth
things
out
and
leaves
a
nice
bready
aftertaste
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
hops
with
a
decent
creaminess
d
i
would
not
tire
of
this
one
easily
nice
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
tasty
though
12oz
single
bottle
purchased
for
3
50
i
think
it
was
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
massive
fluffy
head
decent
hoppy
aroma
first
taste
is
sweet
is
that
the
cane
sugar
they
refer
to
on
the
label
solid
balance
between
a
lot
of
hops
and
a
lot
of
malt
full
bodied
good
stuff
but
tough
to
say
if
its
worth
the
premium
d
notes
im
not
sure
what
the
difference
is
between
a
well
hoped
rye
beer
and
an
ipa
if
it
is
the
sourness
this
one
has
it
pretty
drinkable
i
liked
it
d
i
noticed
a
lot
of
people
compared
this
beer
to
founders
red
rye
and
i
will
agree
that
the
red
rye
is
probably
better
overall
with
this
one
probably
being
a
little
more
drinkable
appearance
is
slightly
hazy
copper
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
an
offwhite
head
good
lacing
the
aromas
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
tingle
my
nose
along
with
earthy
rye
malts
in
the
background
smells
very
inviting
flavor
has
much
the
same
as
aroma
and
the
full
mouthfeel
practically
encourages
me
to
chew
this
beer
moderate
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
finish
is
a
bit
harsh
as
i
get
to
the
bottom
of
my
glass
from
all
the
hops
but
i
guess
that
means
all
you
hopheads
out
there
are
going
to
really
like
this
beer
im
really
fond
of
the
sweetness
what
a
great
flavor
it
helps
complete
an
already
flavorful
and
satisfying
hop
based
beer
notes
first
time
with
the
style
i
have
to
say
i
would
have
it
again
and
again
good
brew
and
well
balanced
session
maybekind
of
sweet
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
that
was
a
plus
dthis
is
a
very
fine
beer
i
could
easily
toss
back
several
of
these
babies
and
will
seek
it
out
again
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
last
night
deks
i
had
it
right
after
the
brooklyn
grand
cru
and
it
held
its
own
vs
a
top
notch
beer
this
beer
poured
a
dark
clear
amber
with
a
very
minimal
head
the
smell
is
of
hops
and
rye
malts
i
was
amazed
with
the
tast
seeing
how
clear
the
beer
was
it
was
full
of
flavor
a
wonderful
hoppy
rye
there
seems
to
be
alot
of
them
around
now
and
i
love
it
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
and
deep
the
main
flavors
i
get
are
nuts
bitter
hops
and
wonderful
creamy
malty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
and
it
is
certainly
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
limited
only
by
ones
tolerance
for
hops
this
is
really
a
ryepa
and
at
7
abv
ends
up
tasting
like
a
pretty
big
beer
it
is
good
though
and
its
biggest
fault
was
the
metallic
taste
a
very
good
tasting
and
fantastic
looking
beer
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
reasonable
price
pick
up
a
couple
pours
an
opaque
caramel
color
in
the
glass
a
huge
bubbly
off
white
head
erupts
and
slowly
dissipates
leaving
sticky
lacing
all
around
smells
equally
of
caramel
and
hops
very
balanced
pleasant
aroma
nothing
overwhelms
the
olfactory
the
taste
is
outstanding
the
hops
and
rye
play
off
each
other
to
make
this
a
creamy
ipa
the
hops
are
not
a
present
in
the
initial
taste
but
really
come
up
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
taste
is
as
well
balanced
as
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
nothing
hangs
on
too
long
but
one
can
easily
distinguish
the
different
flavors
drinkibility
is
a
little
lower
just
from
a
taste
perspective
unless
you
stick
with
a
really
hoppy
follow
up
your
taste
buds
will
not
be
happy
my
first
rye
ale
for
me
its
a
standard
west
coast
american
ipa
with
an
added
dimention
will
purchase
again
for
a
bitter
fix
in
the
future
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
for
my
taste
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
to
offset
the
spicy
rye
if
you
are
a
rye
beer
fan
this
one
will
certainly
give
you
your
fix
in
general
i
love
the
look
aroma
and
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
sits
rather
heavy
and
the
bittering
is
particularly
forward
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
worth
picking
up
and
perhaps
even
seeking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
i
know
i
am
d
a
nice
rye
beer
from
a
brewery
i
have
never
tried
before
but
founders
red
and
bear
republic
hop
rod
rye
are
in
another
category
all
together
in
comparison
try
it
with
soba
noodles
veggies
and
tofu
in
a
garlic
sesame
sauce
md
the
taste
is
full
and
enjoyable
you
would
not
know
that
this
is
7
if
you
didnt
read
the
label
d
great
first
impression
of
this
brewery
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
definitely
recommend
it
di
like
the
sweetcitrus
hop
combo
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
brew
good
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
flows
nicely
throughout
to
beer
to
be
met
with
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
palm
sugar
and
ends
with
the
dryness
of
the
rye
well
done
great
hybrid
beer
the
palm
sugar
is
interesting
though
i
have
no
idea
why
a
new
favorite
thanks
brothers
keep
it
up
please
a
very
hoppy
beer
i
would
prefer
more
of
the
rye
to
come
through
high
abv
and
bitterness
limits
consumption
edit
had
this
again
recently
and
it
was
nowhere
close
to
being
as
good
as
i
remembered
did
they
tweak
the
recipe
pours
a
beautiful
deep
clear
copper
with
a
small
dense
offwhite
head
there
is
a
good
ring
and
some
foam
along
the
top
throughout
with
very
good
lacing
along
the
sides
absolutely
wonderful
looking
brew
the
smell
more
hops
than
rye
with
a
huge
citrus
and
floral
aroma
up
front
with
grapefruit
leading
the
way
the
rye
malt
is
in
the
background
but
noticeable
the
taste
has
some
of
the
same
stuff
but
with
a
heavier
malt
presence
that
balances
the
hops
nicely
there
is
also
more
sweetness
in
the
backbone
of
the
taste
with
molasses
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
for
a
rye
beer
very
creamy
and
smooth
but
with
a
fairly
dry
crisp
finish
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
and
i
would
rate
it
right
up
there
with
the
best
rye
beers
ive
tasted
highly
recommended
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
definitely
something
a
bit
different
for
the
hopheads
and
pale
ale
fans
it
is
pretty
drinkable
however
the
price
was
a
bit
steep
12
99
for
a
4pack
i
would
definitely
recommend
grabbing
a
pint
sometime
i
dont
think
ill
pick
it
up
again
in
bottles
due
to
the
price
though
d
superb
simple
as
that
i
would
have
this
beer
again
d
i
wish
i
could
have
bought
a
case
one
sitting
is
not
enough
i
try
to
savor
each
sip
to
preserve
the
lone
bottle
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
recommended
hope
this
beer
unretires
if
not
ill
have
to
find
it
playing
golf
in
florida
drinkability
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
undetectable
a
panty
dropper
of
the
ipa
world
wow
this
is
one
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
offering
from
two
brothers
with
full
use
of
the
rye
notes
a
delicous
creamy
carbonation
and
even
with
some
hop
fade
some
fantastic
dry
hopped
character
im
all
over
this
stuff
next
time
its
released
as
im
sure
its
incredible
fresh
excellent
beer
notes
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hopleaf
in
chicago
and
it
was
way
better
than
this
probably
a
freshness
issue
d
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
rye
beer
it
has
a
wonderful
nose
and
sold
hop
character
very
balanced
i
could
definitely
work
my
way
through
a
six
pack
of
these
dont
let
the
price
dissuade
you
its
worth
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
at
7
i
wouldnt
mind
another
d
nice
beer
very
drinkable
even
for
a
rye
beer
smooth
nice
dark
bronze
color
with
a
good
off
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
pulls
me
right
in
nice
piney
hops
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
must
be
the
rye
this
beer
reminds
me
of
reds
rye
from
founders
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
there
is
something
very
nice
about
the
way
the
rye
blends
with
a
fully
hopped
beer
that
is
very
nice
taste
is
as
good
as
the
smell
full
sweet
flavor
brilliantly
blended
with
the
hops
some
significant
earthy
tones
sneak
in
there
too
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
gives
this
a
dry
finish
not
sure
what
the
availablility
of
this
one
is
i
picked
it
up
in
a
variety
case
but
i
would
give
this
one
a
huge
recomendation
if
you
can
find
it
d
very
flavorful
beer
with
well
hidden
alcohol
but
something
in
the
balance
and
mouthfeel
makes
me
just
want
either
a
reds
rye
or
nugget
nectar
as
this
ends
up
feeling
like
a
compromise
between
the
two
especially
at
the
slightly
high
price
for
it
in
this
area
d
may
i
have
another
md
malt
lingers
on
the
palate
and
leaves
a
pleasant
finish
smooth
low
carbonation
and
tons
of
flavor
make
this
beer
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
itplease
do
so
a
dark
red
with
an
offtan
head
poor
retention
and
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
herbal
with
that
rye
spice
the
flavor
immediately
reminds
me
of
reds
rye
from
founders
for
obvious
reasons
its
a
big
but
not
too
harsh
citrus
tang
as
satisfying
as
any
good
ipa
or
hopped
red
ale
but
with
that
wonderful
rye
twist
to
make
it
stand
out
worth
a
try
quite
tasty
poured
a
hazy
rusty
brown
colored
head
with
plenty
of
creamy
head
sitting
on
top
it
looks
like
it
was
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
like
guinness
nose
is
full
of
rye
and
spicineyness
taste
is
full
of
hops
but
also
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
full
rye
mouth
feel
is
incredibly
creamy
for
a
pale
ale
and
full
on
hops
overall
i
was
really
blown
away
by
this
one
i
did
not
expect
it
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
really
a
top
notch
quality
brew
on
all
accounts
that
i
would
love
to
have
the
chance
to
try
again
if
you
see
this
one
around
go
for
it
mouthfeel
creamy
and
slick
conveys
the
full
hoppy
goodness
solid
crisp
slightly
sour
rye
malt
background
matches
the
flavor
assault
well
alcohol
well
integrated
a
riparye
ipa
very
nicely
done
final
note
this
beer
is
not
retired
its
a
limitedrun
seasonal
and
its
delicious
dthis
is
a
nice
well
made
beer
where
the
rye
makes
its
presence
known
d
rich
and
thick
for
the
style
not
very
sessionable
but
damn
good
for
a
stand
alone
beer
d
good
d
for
the
smell
and
taste
alone
but
the
unexpected
richness
of
the
body
bumps
it
up
a
little
held
up
nicely
to
the
strong
taste
of
a
pizza
with
feta
cheeze
this
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
spicy
rye
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
very
balanced
up
front
with
a
lot
of
spicy
caramel
and
toffee
and
some
grapefruit
the
finish
is
dominated
by
a
dry
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
could
drink
this
agian
when
in
the
mood
for
a
well
balanced
rye
beer
cheers
d
i
really
liked
this
one
i
love
rye
based
beer
and
this
one
is
excellent
i
liked
founders
reds
rye
better
but
this
is
a
close
second
the
nose
is
a
terrific
blend
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malt
sweet
and
sticky
the
sticky
really
emerges
in
the
taste
combining
very
well
with
the
hops
to
produce
something
vaguely
reminiscent
of
a
lighter
version
of
sierra
nevadas
bigfootsweeter
but
wellhopped
and
sticky
as
bigfoot
is
as
well
i
was
very
impressed
i
greatly
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
of
such
beers
the
complexity
gives
one
a
bit
of
everything
never
a
letdown
this
felt
stronger
than
the
7
00
abv
a
bit
boozy
in
the
delicious
taste
but
that
doesnt
detract
from
a
beer
that
ill
soon
revisit
tremendous
this
is
one
all
around
solid
beer
pours
a
cherry
red
color
almost
opaque
nice
hops
on
the
nose
and
some
sweet
citrus
as
well
very
clean
and
smooth
also
crisp
on
the
palate
and
an
extremely
dry
finish
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
and
hope
it
has
not
been
discontinued

thanks
andrew
drinkability
for
a
very
much
too
strong
ipa
not
bad
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
me
there
is
nothing
fancy
about
this
beer
and
sometimes
thats
just
what
i
want
drinkability
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
extreme
kind
of
beer
but
this
makes
for
an
easier
drinking
brew
than
i
was
expecting
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
cloying
after
about
half
a
glass
but
not
to
severely
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
go
with
founders
red
rye
or
hop
rod
rye
if
you
want
a
better
hopped
up
rye
beer
a
hop
chirp
hits
and
in
a
millisecond
is
eclipsed
by
a
moreryethanrye
bite
a
sugary
kiss
and
a
bitter
farewell
reader
i
dont
know
if
youll
understand
me
or
not
when
i
say
that
this
beer
is
fast
but
it
is
holy
shit
how
this
beer
is
fast
boomboomboomboom
four
distinct
traits
in
about
half
a
second
repeat
this
is
how
a
beer
should
drink
slight
resinous
oil
in
the
surprisingly
unslick
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
and
my
thirst
have
a
causequench
relationship
a
very
good
rye
ipa
bitter
but
balanced
love
it
tasted
on
3708
pours
a
clear
ruby
hued
brown
with
a
thick
creme
head
nose
is
nice
definite
grass
clippings
there
with
some
piney
citrus
its
a
nice
full
nose
that
isnt
blasting
away
at
my
nostrils
i
like
it
flavor
is
smooth
nice
thick
grainy
level
bright
citric
tones
this
is
an
awfully
hoppy
rye
but
its
nice
smooth
liquid
feel
and
a
full
carbonation
the
flavors
are
the
same
as
the
aromas
but
a
little
heartier
a
lot
heartier
the
viscous
mouth
feel
blend
into
the
slight
alcohol
flavor
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
cardboard
light
green
lemon
zest
flavor
is
in
the
middle
of
it
too
but
not
the
good
part
of
a
lemon
other
than
that
the
flavor
is
impeccable
the
rye
isnt
strong
but
it
is
very
good
it
starts
of
light
and
dry
the
bitterness
is
right
up
front
turns
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
middle
and
stays
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
up
there
way
up
there
d
this
kind
of
beer
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
well
made
and
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
very
enjoyable
for
an
ibu
pervert
honestly
my
biggest
complaint
isnt
really
the
level
of
bitterness
but
that
it
is
such
a
sharp
acrid
bitterness
personally
i
think
some
of
those
bittering
hops
might
have
been
better
used
for
aroma
and
flavor
well
this
was
my
first
rye
beer
and
i
had
a
great
time
with
it
first
the
color
is
a
deep
amber
there
really
wasnt
much
of
a
head
on
is
when
i
poured
it
but
slightly
carbonated
the
smells
are
very
distinct
but
i
really
liked
it
for
the
most
part
the
mouth
feel
was
great
totally
smooth
and
creamy
but
had
a
little
bite
on
the
tongue
will
drink
again
an
interesting
beer
great
dry
hop
character
rye
adds
a
nice
complexity
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
glad
i
got
more
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
rye
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
almost
a
sweeter
ipa
i
liked
it
and
would
have
more
i
like
the
bitter
citrus
hop
tones
it
may
not
exactly
be
true
to
form
but
still
a
good
choice
this
beer
makes
me
say
sure
we
can
session
this
i
just
hope
there
is
someone
to
get
us
home
later
a
really
nice
rye
ale
give
this
a
whirl
not
bad
medium
bodied
sticky
sweet
on
the
toungue
and
teeth
yet
dry
finishing
as
well
kind
of
weird
this
one
was
way
too
sweet
for
me
there
was
a
nice
hop
bitterness
at
the
back
but
way
too
much
sweetness
up
front
not
a
fan
of
this
one
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
that
have
rye
listed
in
the
name
but
the
ones
ive
tried
have
all
turned
out
to
be
quite
tasty
and
satisfying
great
beer
very
nice
and
sessionable
possibly
2
brothers
most
popular
brew
d
really
a
good
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
could
drink
easily
while
hanging
out
definitely
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
it
to
be
especially
since
the
bottle
says
it
was
a
hopped
up
red
rye
ale
nevertheless
still
a
very
good
beer
and
one
they
should
brew
all
year
round
so
we
could
enjoy
it
all
the
time
hope
it
at
least
comes
back
at
some
point
the
only
problem
is
that
i
only
bought
one
so
i
guess
that
is
not
a
possibility
note
that
is
my
own
fault
and
does
not
hurt
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
recommended
for
fans
of
rye
beers
fairly
drinkable
and
almost
sessionable
except
the
7
abv
would
catch
up
with
one
sooner
rather
than
later
more
good
stuff
from
two
brothers
this
bomber
is
going
down
quite
nicely
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
have
an
interesting
beer
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
hop
flavor
since
it
is
supposedly
hoppedup

do

all
i
detect
is
the
smell
of
alcohol
a
little
unimpressed
the
taste
is
a
surprise
maltier
than
i
expected
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
have
liked
more
hoppiness
to
balance
this
out
a
little
more
the
rye
is
somewhat
apparent
with
vanilla
everyone
i
shared
this
with
had
a
different
take
along
with
some
caramel
malt
sneaking
in
behind
the
hops
the
flavor
was
decently

i
went
to
the
release
party
for
this
beer
at
the
hop
leaf
the
other
day
and
i
was
really
impressed
a
white
head
topped
a
rusty
red
colored
beer
it
has
a
sweet
fruityfloral
smell
and
assertive
hoppy
flavor
that
hits
you
right
away
as
you
work
through
the
pint
it
develops
a
kind
of
creaminess
and
sweetness
in
back
of
the
hop
bitterness
that
gave
it
layers
of
flavor
making
me
want
to
drink
more
more
this
is
my

this
is
pretty
good
nothing
special
kinda
sweet
tropical
fruit
and
dry
rye
its
drinkable
i
guess
expecting
a
very
potent
rye
flavor
in
a
beer
with
rye
in
the
name
was
something
i
should
have
tempered
given
bluepoints
reputation
had
this
on
cask
and
was
expecting
a
more
pronounced
rye
aroma
and
bite
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
ive
had
other
beers
with
rye
in
the
wort
which
expressed
the
character
of
this
grain
in
a
much
more
forward
fashion
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
pleasant
bitterness
and
earthy
spice
that
hints
at
rye
but
i
wanted
it
more
front
and
center
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
foam
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
made
up
of
some
nice
hop
notes
as
well
as
toasted
rye
the
taste
is
straight
forward
with
heavy
rye
flavors
but
mellowing
out
and
then
a
nice
crisp
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
nice
for
the
beer
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
ale
starts
off
with
a
dark
strawamber
color
nice
egg
shell
head
with
a
fine
bubble
rim
after
it
recedes
nice
lacing
this
ale
has
a
very
malty
nose
with
a
taste
that
follows
not
very
complex
straight
forward
this
ale
has
moderate
carbonation
not
exactly
smooth
and
sort
of
thick
i
honestly
would
not
recommend
this
ale
it
is
not
vey
complex
but
if
you
do
open
it
you
should
go
ahead
and
drink
the
one
you
opened
o
the
rye
treads
a
little
more
lightly
in
this
beer
than
it
does
in
many
others
playful
tropical
hops
go
a
long
way
to
temper
it
a
more
easygoing
beer
and
even
quaffable
love
the
price
point
and
easy
availability
too
perhaps
not
everything
i
was
expecting
given
that
this
was
a
gold
medal
winner
at
this
years
gabf
but
its
a
pleasant
enough
drink
overall
a
tasty
hop
forward
rye
ale
why
has
it
taken
me
so
long
to
find
a
rye
beer
with
this
name
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlytoasted
rye
bread
mild
caramel
and
a
smattering
of
earthy
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
with
a
twinge
of
quinine
in
there
for
notsogood
measure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
enough
rye
beer
but
one
that
goes
a
touch
sideways
on
the
tongue
o
tasty
havent
been
let
down
by
any
blue
point
beers
thus
far
i
was
just
on
long
island
wish
i
could
have
made
a
trip
out
the
brewery
and
checked
em
out
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
nice
big
beige
head
that
persists
forever
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
an
herbal
earthy
edge
and
faint
traces
of
yeasty
plastic
phenols
the
flavor
holds
much
of
the
same
attributes
from
the
nose
caramel
toffee
and
butterscotch
mixed
with
earthy
floral
hops
and
a
weird
herbal
almost
medicinal
flavor
medium
body
with
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
thought
this
one
was
ok
but
nothing
special
its
got
a
weirdness
to
it
that
i
just
couldnt
get
into
all
4s
o
solid
rye
pale
ale
im
not
familiar
with
this
brewery
at
all
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
pretty
good
beer
certainly
drinkable
and
something
i
would
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
aroma
is
not
strong
but
definitely
has
notes
of
rye
and
hops
and
a
fruity
slightly
yeasty
underpinning
pours
a
clear
bubbly
copper
with
a
thick
fluffy
rather
persistent
pale
wheat
head
rye
dominates
the
flavor
which
has
fruity
malty
and
hoppy
hints
smooth
texture
has
good
body
and
fizz
an
interesting
if
not
superb
beer
give
it
a
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
which
developed
a
nice
head
which
lasted
and
laced
through
the
dring
aroma
was
mildly
sweet
malty
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
with
good
carbonation
taste
was
of
a
mild
malty
nature
and
nutty
with
hints
of
caramel
aftertaste
was
mild
and
sweet
overall
avearge
taste
brings
this
one
down
ok
but
lackluster
overall
a
fairly
wellbalanced
ipa
and
definitely
drinkable
the
relatively
high
7
5
abv
is
definitely
wellhidden
this
is
definitely
a
nice
showcase
of
ryes
unique
qualities
which
combine
with
the
bitter
resinous
west
coast
hop
notes
to
keep
the
drinker
reaching
for
another
swill
with
the
proceeds
going
toward
a
good
cause
this
one
seems
to
be
right
out
of
sweetwaters
books
clear
golden
amber
colored
body
and
a
two
finger
thick
head
were
pleasing
to
look
at
the
smell
was
mild
and
sweetish
with
honey
and
cinnamon
notes
the
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
anticipating
i
got
a
clean
crisp
taste
like
a
an
apa
with
minimal
fruity
and
spicy
notes
that
are
typical
in
a
rye
beer
the
hops
were
not
all
that
aggressively
showcased
either
with
only
a
faint
bitterness
and
some
spice
in
the
finish
this
was
pretty
good
in
the
mouthfeel
department
with
a
smooth
body
that
glided
across
the
tongue
pretty
basic
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
i
tip
my
glass
to
the
brew
wizards
at
blue
point
mouthfeel
is
also
very
nice
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
a
little
bit
of
resin
this
is
an
excellent
rye
beer
everything
is
well
balanced
and
the
flavors
are
nice
my
only
real
desire
is
for
the
nose
to
be
bolder
maybe
have
a
little
bit
darker
head
but
thats
an
aesthetic
thing
good
rye
beer
not
to
the
level
of
say
a
reds
rye
but
tasty
in
its
own
right
more
fruity
than
i
expected
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
leaves
rings
of
lacing
down
the
glass
a
very
nice
floral
hop
and
peppery
toasted
malt
aroma
i
love
smell
of
rye
beers
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
different
than
the
aroma
at
first
you
get
a
nice
toasted
malt
and
peppery
rye
flavor
but
then
it
fades
into
a
rather
sweet
floral
hop
flavor
not
getting
the
bitterness
that
i
had
expected
its
there
but
more
sweet
than
bitter
feel
is
medium
body
and
a
bit
syrupy
my
favorite
beer
style
and
although
it
is
tasty
the
bit
of
syrupy
sweetness
does
just
knock
it
down
a
notch
but
you
might
expect
that
with
the
higher
gravity
still
a
solid
rye
beer
though
overall
its
okay
but
there
are
better
rye
beers
to
be
had
out
there
if
you
really
must
know
as
far
as
rye
ales
go
this
is
a
hit
a
very
sweet
beer
throughout
with
a
copperlike
bitterness
that
follows
minutes
after
the
glass
is
over
you
just
feel
it
calling
to
you
to
drink
some
more
a
very
tasty
pour
and
quite
complex
for
a
rye
ale
pours
a
light
cloudy
copper
with
golden
edges
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
retained
for
a
bit
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
mild
rye
notes
along
with
some
hops
as
far
as
the
flavor
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
combines
well
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
spice
of
the
rye
everything
is
present
but
the
entire
intensity
of
the
flavor
profile
is
less
than
expected
this
is
a
very
sessionable
offering
but
nothing
spectacular
not
a
bad
beer
spiny
and
vigorous

this
is
a
nice
beer
the
malts
and
hops
are
great
compliments
its
bitter
but
not
harsh
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
rye
to
come
through
overall
but
in
the
end
this
is
a
refreshing
very
drinkable
beer
with
very
good
flavor
o
a
very
mild
rye
ale
the
body
does
not
do
the
rye
component
justice
the
flavor
of
hops
and
type
of
dry
malts
do
not
bring
out
the
best
of
the
rye
this
beer
just
got
better
as
it
went
down
i
debated
on
a
lot
of
the
ratings
but
went
with
what
i
put
down
may
change
later
but
damn
this
was
good
i
like
this
beer
and
im
a
fan
of
the
rye
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
nice
beer
overall
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
o
drinks
fairly
nicely
considering
the
abv
and
lingering
bitterness
still
this
is
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
nothing
i
would
turn
down
o
a
pretty
good
beer
with
probably
better
drinkability
than
in
should
have
this
is
a
very
user
friendly
beer
with
a

more
citrus
than
rye

i
was

some

resiny

like
the

approach
but
to
their
credit
its

single

with
a

of

on
a
slightly
hazy
golden

body
aroma
is
very

and
in
comparison
to
others
it
is
subpar
mostly
consists
of
citrus
hops
for
taste
there
are
more
citrus
hop
flavors
but
also
light
licorice
notes
as
well
but
no
rye
to
speak
of
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
drinkable
overall
and
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
rye
beers
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
after
this
being
recommended
from
me
liking
hop
rod
i
wont
buy
this
again
overall
i
really
really
like
rastafa
rye
definitely
not
tough
to
drink
and
a
steady
to
keep
in
your
fridge
rastafa
rye
has
its
own
identity
you
have
the
pine
with
a
little
spice
and
nothing
to
complain
about
cheers
to
all
this
beers
got
some
character
and
a
refreshing
floralspicy
combo
that
said
im
not
a
repeat
buyer
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
sample
it
none
the
less
this
is
my
first
tasting
of
a
rye
beer
very
nice
but
absolutely
not
what
i
expected
solid
not
must
have
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
this
is
a
rye
beer
that
ipa
fans
will
like
the
rye
gives
it
a
crispness
thats
hard
to
characterize
definitely
will
buy
again

it
was

this
beer
mever
seemed
to
find

started
out
a

malty
and
sweet
closely
followed
by
rather
nondescript
hops
bittering
then
a
touch
of
spicy
bite
from
the
rye
but
not
reallly
enought
to
make
a
statement
that
this
is
a
rye
beer
none
of
the
flavors
seemed
to
play
well
together
and
the
whole
was
not
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
served

into

very

maintained
excellent

the

was

the
flavor
was

it

overall
this
was

i
thought
i
had
smelled
rye
in

beer
before

this
one
kicked
me
in
the
face
with
it
definitely
one
of
the
most
intense
rye
smelling
brews
i
have
had
todate
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
subtle
on
the
rye
execution
allowing
more
complex
flavors
to
come
out
while
it
was
more
complex
it
wasnt
necessarily
blended
very
well
the
metallic
flavor
was
killed
the
flavor
on
the
brew
for
me
if
i
had
to
pick
one
worth
trying
but
that
is
about
it
o
four
overall
really
solid
beer
with
great
taste
reminds
me
of
my
ex
i
recently
have
become
a
fan
of
rye
beers
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
good
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
pleasingly
full
refreshing
delightful
to
drink
o
a
good
beer
nice
change
of
pace
pretty
darn
good
ipalike
rye
ale
although
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
an
ipa
a
treat
for
rye
fans
looking
for
a
good
medium
ale
with
some
bite
definitely
worth
trying
what
a
good
beer
most
rye
beers
dont
do
it
for
me
but
this
was
great
recommended
od
an
enjoyable
beer
i
wish
it
were
more
fresh
but
has
some
good
breadlike
qualities
overall
a
decent
beer
but
barely
qualifies
as
a
rye
beer
o
a
fine
session
beer
easily
recommended
to
fans
of
rye
beers
wait
i
see
the
abv
is
7
5
it
is
well
hidden
in
both
aroma
and
taste
so
be
careful
this
beer
is
more
complex
as
i
originally
thought
certainly
a
good
buy
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
some
spices
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
good
hops
spice
some
rye
are
all
present
very
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
high
quality
beer
from
a
22
oz
bomber
with
no
obvious
freshness
markings
into
a
pint
glass
coppery
clear
color
with
slim
threads
of
carbonation
one
finger
tan
head
fades
to
half
and
holds
good
lacing
nose
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
not
much
else
rye
perhaps
something
grainygrassy
is
there
in
the
mouth
surprisingly
tasty
compared
to
nose
malt
up
front
slightly
bready
with
a
definite
spiciness
a
friend
said
it
tasted
of
unprocessed
wheat
but
i
didnt
get
much
rye
definitely
a
pleasant
semisweet
spiced
flavor
that
is
enjoyable
moderate
hops
presence
evens
things
out
mouth
his
smooth
and
viscous
fitting
to
this
beers
character
overall
pretty
tasty
in
its
own
right
this
is
my
first
rye
ale
so
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
its
spicy
and
malty
yet
with
a
nice
hops
bite
good
recommended
this
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
creamy
tan
colored
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
spicy
aroma
to
it
and
some
light
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
also
a
bit
spicy
but
i
liked
it
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
from
the
cask
was
a
little
flat
and
thin
im
not
sure
if
a
cask
was
the
right
move
for
this
brew
overall
i
think
itd
be
better
from
the
bottle
but
i
still
found
it
enjoyable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
orange
with
two
fingers
of
white
foam
settles
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
streaks
of
delicate
lacing
smell
sweet
caramel
lightly
bready
spicy
with
some
orange
citrus
taste
toffee
and
citrus
thin
out
mid
sip
to
leave
you
with
a
mouthful
of
rye
bread
moderate
sweetness
throughout
with
a
sticky
drying
finish
active
carbonation
is
a
little
too
active
mid
sip
and
washes
the
flavors
away
too
quickly
still
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
medium
bodied
ditto
for
the
carbonation
a
good
smooth
mouthfeel
with
some
good
drinkability
i
like
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
after
writing
my
initial
tasting
notes
i
finished
the
bottle
with
some
bbq
ribs
and
it
was
a
perfect
match
for
some
spicy
food
i
recommend
it
drinkibility
is
pretty
high
for
a
7
5
beer
put
down
a
few
pints
with
no
problems
poured
ontap
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
looks
like
their
toaste
lager
with
a
deep
copper
coloring
and
a
thin
sparse
offwhite
head
the
beers
smell
is
sweet
and
woodsy
the
flavors
are
light
sweet
malt
with
toasted
smokey
grain
flavors
carrying
the
load
good
smooth
body
and
flavor
smooth
almost
sweet
finish
with
a
slight
whiskey
aftertaste
extremely
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
the
word
is
getting
around
i
picked
up
this
bad
boys
bad
boys
what
ya
gonna
do
bomber
at
a
gas
station
imagine
that
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
very
heavy
malt
smell
with
molasses
and
some
floral
hopping
on
the
pour
i
get
a
bright
orange
bronze
with
a
heavy
thick
head
that
stands
firm
and
laces
as
it
only
very
gradually
recedes
on
the
taste
this
brew
hits
you
first
with
the
mouthfeel
as
it
is
as
thick
as
it
smells
i
think
you
could
stand
a
spoon
in
it
the
taste
then
hits
very
balanced
with
a
huge
malt
backbone
and
some
tarty
citrus
underlying
hop
bitterness
that
stays
steady
throughout
taste
is
very
consistent
throughout
sweet
malts
and
bitter
hoppiness
with
the
finish
being
a
little
bit
sweeter
and
with
an
earthy
ryelike
tone
this
brew
is
nothing
complex
but
hits
right
between
the
eyes
i
will
seek
out
again
overall
rating
goes
up
here
because
even
if
the
nose
and
body
of
this
beer
are
not
outrageously
stunning
it
does
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
is
mostly
well
played
and
never
overwhelming
and
while
this
is
no
hop
rod
rye
it
makes
for
a
fine
drinkable
ale
overall
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
offering
i
like
the
semi
vienna
lagerlike
taste
combined
with
the
bitter
rye
while
there
is
enough
malt
sweetness
to
keep
things
balanced
as
well
swung
bu
the
brewery
to
grab
some
swag
for
a
bif
and
figured
i
would
sample
a
few
for
a
small
pour
showed
up
with
a
surprisingly
frothy
head
color
was
deep
amber
and
there
was
a
subtle
hop
bite
to
the
brew
good
balance
and
quite
refreshing
the
rye
chills
down
the
hops
a
lot
making
this
7
abv
dangerously
drinkable
smell
was
also
rather
timid
carbonation
was
minimal
and
seemed
a
bit
watery
thankfully
the
taste
fares
better
its
still
a
touch
sweet
but
a
solid
rye
beer
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
apparent
than
id
like
but
this
is
otherwise
a
nice
mix
of
rye
and
floral
hops
not
the
best
brew
but
its
still
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
fairly
well
carbonated
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
for
the
abv
but
if
it
were
less
sweet
im
sure
itd
fare
better
a
pretty
good
beer
from
blue
point
available
at
a
low
price
might
as
well
try
it
out
cant
go
wrong
for
the
three
or
four
bucks
a
bomber
costs
o
very
impressed
for
my
first
rye
beer
you
always
gamble
when
committing
yourself
to
a
16th
keg
based
on
ratings
thats
why
i
turn
to
beer
advocate
before
buying
a
beer
for
the
first
time
very
drinkable
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
7
5
abv
beer
another
fine
beer
from
blue
point
picked
up
a
22
for
3
33
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
bulky
white
head
that
dissipates
very
slowly
taste
is
dominated
by
the
rye
and
very
strong
floral
hop
finish
the
hops
are
very
present
but
not
overwhelming
the
fairly
high
abv
is
not
profane
at
all
i
enjoyed
this
ale
very
much
and
as
i
write
this
and
am
halfway
through
the
bottle
the
head
still
hasnt
dissipated
a
very
nice
brew
for
bargain
prices
the
carbonation
lasts
throughout
and
the
small
head
does
not
die
down
i
hardly
notice
the
7
5
alcohol
and
the
body
is
small
to
medium
leading
to
a
brew
that
can
be
had
over
and
over
in
a
single
night
with
the
excellent
price
i
would
highly
recommend
this
for
the
rye
lovers
out
there
as
well
as
anyone
else
interested
in
this
style
excellent
blend
of
hops
and
rye
and
is
a
must
try
d
drinkability
is
very
good
refreshing
and
interesting
d
the
integration
of
the
flavors
is
just
ok
d
at
7
5
this
is
as
sessionable
as
any
ipa
with
comparable
abv
its
less
hopdominant
and
theres
a
little
bit
of
something
sweet
left
after
the
finish
is
gone
that
warrants
another
sip
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
ill
gladly
drink
on
tap
when
its
available
or
in
bottles
d
just
above
average
nothing
great
about
this
but
nothing
at
all
offensive
either
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
it
was
creamy
wellcarbonated
for
a
cask
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
am
glad
that
i
had
more
than
one
of
d
very
flavorful
moderately
hoppy
without
the
strong
bitterness
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
i
could
easily
down
23
bottles
this
evening
overall
a
nice
springearly
summer
beera
perfect
way
to
close
out
this
mild
late
february
day
d
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
d
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
this
just
a
nice
amberrye
with
intertwined
sweet
and
malty
notes
that
cover
well
a
7
5
strength
blue
point
rastafa
rye
ale
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
hoppy
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
pale
malt
with
a
dry
finish
that
rye
seems
to
add
to
the
mix
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
this
drinks
very
easy
i
could
see
downing
a
few
any
time
compares
favorably
with
reds
rye
imo
i
suppose
here
is
where
im
supposed
to
say
and
i
love
reggae
but
i
dont
cant
stand
it
actually
but
rastafarianism
doesnt
necessarily
count
reggae
as
its
official
music
genre
either
wanna
know
something
else
interesting
according
to
a
credible
source
the
rastafarian
lifestyle
usually
includes
ritual
use
of
marijuana
avoidance
of
alcohol
the
wearing
of
ones
hair
in
dreadlocks
and
vegetarianism
avoidance
of
alcohol
is
someone
gonna
tell
blue
point
oopsie
drinkability
new
to
jax
had
at
engine
15
at
their
tapping
party
nice
beer
this
was
the
wild
card
of
the
night
definitly
my
favorite
but
not
a
sessionable
as
i
though
fanatstic
robust
flavor
though
and
the
winner
tonight
awesome
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
and
interesting
beer
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
i
noticed
more
rye
and
malts
worth
trying
d
i
guess
my
only
recommendation
is
to
have
this
fresh
because
with
age
it
turns
into
a
dry
sour
malt
bomb
fresh
it
was
hard
to
distinguish
it
from
most
ipas
so
try
it
as
fresh
as
possible
if
you
see
sediment
pass
the
taste
has
the
sour
that
i
know
rye
tastes
like
theres
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
mixed
in
that
works
rather
nicely
the
palette
ends
with
a
dry
finish
kinda
what
my
nose
predicted
dgood
sits
heavily
in
the
stomach
the
aftertaste
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
through
d
pretty
decent
beer
could
easily
finish
the
bomber
probley
wouldnt
want
anymore
than
the
bomber
though
good
color
and
nice
head
to
begin
but
retention
was
low
as
well
as
lacing
has
a
level
of
hoppiness
and
rye
in
the
aroma
but
not
overpowering
flavors
are
high
in
hoppiness
with
a
good
hint
of
rye
in
the
background
would
have
liked
some
more
rye
flavor
up
front
has
an
appropriate
dryness
at
the
end
something
i
like
in
a
rye
beer
will
have
a
tendency
to
burn
you
out
after
a
few
poured
a
copperish
amber
brown
with
yellow
highlights
with
a
thin
head
a
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
did
have
spice
from
the
rye
with
malty
sweetness
slight
bready
citrusy
hoppy
and
grainy
notes
the
taste
also
had
the
grain
character
with
sweet
malts
spice
rye
citrus
and
mild
hop
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
spice
citrusy
and
slight
hoppy
finish
actually
drank
very
good
but
was
just
an
average
beer
still
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
since
we
dont
get
it
on
the
west
coast
poured
a
reddishbrown
body
w
2finger
head
that
died
slow
and
left
lace
a
musty
malt
aroma
dry
roasted
malts
give
the
aroma
an
edge
along
w
sweet
malt
smells
like
caramel
for
a
balanced
aroma
piques
of
bread
and
dryness
arise
from
rye
a
plain
and
basic
but
still
enjoyable
brew
a
good
hoppy
bite
in
a
lighttomedium
body
that
retains
a
dry
roasted
malt
edge
some
sweet
caramel
or
light
honey
malts
are
there
for
balance
and
noticeable
as
well
a
good
but
not
standout
brew
that
is
a
good
dry
and
sweet
ale
that
finishes
a
little
crisp
d
not
a
bad
rye
beer
sort
of
all
over
the
place
and
not
super
well
integrated
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
dont
really
feel
like
id
want
to
come
back
to
this
d
average
drinkability
for
my
tastes
this
brew
performs
better
out
of
a
bottle
preferably
with
age
than
it
does
on
draft
overall
a
pretty
impressive
brew
that
should
appeal
to
any
rye
lover
d
as
far
as
a
pale
ale
goes
i
could
crush
these
all
night
long
very
drinkable
but
not
in
the
class
of
many
west
coast
ipas
out
there
more
on
point
with
a
good
pale
ale
excellent
beer
the
rye
is
masterfully
mingled
with
the
brews
other
characteristics
to
create
a
truly
great
beer
if
this
is
what
blue
point
can
do
ill
be
looking
to
add
a
few
more
to
my
fridge
in
the
near
future
overall
not
the
best
blue
point
beer
and
not
the
worst
its
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
something
you
can
drink
if
you
want
to
have
a
night
of
drinking
but
not
really
something
to
drink
if
you
want
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
beer
and
analyze
the
complexities
of
it
cheers
d
rastafa
rye
is
a
good
malt
bomb
that
truly
depicts
the
style
please
just
sip
it
because
of
the
alcohol
this
tastes
like
a
muted
version
of
bear
republics
hop
rye
which
i
also
was
not
too
fond
of
my
preference
is
a
more
balanced
rye
style
like
from
terrapin
or
sixpoint
or
the
bruery
excellent
brew
deep
amber
color
nice
frothy
head
from
a
growler
pour
carbonation
was
just
right
aromas
of
rye
are
present
and
a
bit
noticeable
in
the
taste
this
brew
goes
down
very
nicely
and
be
careful
of
the
7
5
abv
i
saved
some
for
the
next
day
and
the
brew
stayed
fresh
in
the
growler
a
small
bit
of
carbonation
was
lost
but
still
a
pleasant
drink
overall
there
wasnt
a
single
aspect
of
this
beer
that
stood
out
but
everything
was
done
well
not
worth
seeking
out
but
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
a
solid
offering
and
good
value
just
not
quite
in
the
top
tier
unique
and
a
good
way
to
break
out
of
a
beer
rut
drinkability
a
great
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
rye
beers
while
the
rye
is
certainly
not
as
assertive
as
in
others
of
the
style
this
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
goes
down
easily
and
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
heres
my
problem
this
beer
would
be
uninteresting
without
rye
maybe
a
touch
of
toast
but
otherwise
too
sweet
i
suppose
i
could
be
used
to
a
more
robust
hop
presence
to
keep
such
in
check
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
medium
amber
with
variance
in
the
color
towards
the
edges
of
the
glass
rich
white
head
that
sits
thin
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
of
sweet
rye
with
a
light
biscuit
touch
from
the
yeast
as
well
as
citrus
and
mild
bitter
hops
and
a
bit
of
apricot
taste
is
balanced
between
the
sweet
rye
malt
with
a
bit
of
complimentary
yeast
flavor
floral
and
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
fruitspice
flavor
cloves
perhaps
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
unique
due
to
the
rye
malt
extremely
drinkable
drinkability
a
good
beer
and
one
thats
thoroughly
enjoyable
its
hop
and
rye
flavors
and
relatively
high
alcohol
make
this
one
less
sessionable
but
this
can
be
good
for
a
sitting
or
two
of
beer
definitely
something
worth
having
and
a
brew
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
drinkability
i
found
this
one
very
drinkable
with
each
sip
easily
following
the
last
and
id
be
happy
to
have
another
this
one
is
now
on
my
shopping
list
especially
if
i
can
find
it
on
cask
again
wish
i
had
bought
one
more
of
those
but
the
label
is
so
dumb
looking
i
didnt
think
i
should
well
i
guess
i
was
intrigued
at
what
a
rye
ale
had
to
do
with
rasta
so
maybe
im
the
dumb
one
pretty
good
beer
definitely
better
than
this
brewerys
flagship
beer
the
mediocre
toasted
lager
i
mean
its
worthwhile
definitely
this
one
is
like
a
heavy
beer
but
not
really
the
medium
body
and
chewy
mouthfeel
make
this
one
seem
big
but
the
mostly
clean
finish
makes
this
one
crisp
and
delicious
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
and
could
my
top
rye
beer
delicious
this

a

and
tropical
pineapple

honey
hops
and

seemlessly
together
for
a

carbonation
is
very
bright

rigorous
this

is
probably
enhanced
by
the

a

its
easy
going
down
for

and
is
even
somewhat
refreshing
i
would
be
massively
happy
with
this
beer
any
day
of
the
summer
or
paired
with
anything
than
came
off
the
grill
but
also
shellfish
lamb
or
pork
would
be
great
anything
with
a
savory
and
soft
sweetness
will
be
complimented
and
cleanly
eventuated
by
this
softly
sweet
and
appetizingly
crisp
rye
ale
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
its
different
but
its
nothing
wild
and
its
not
straight
good
enough
for
me
to
go
crazy
about
tasty
though
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
flavors
seem
well
rounded
and
not
overly
complex
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
when
the
opportunity
arises
this
is
a
blue
point
beer
worth
trying
and
it
wont
let
you
down
22oz

this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
there
is
a
somewhat
frothyfizzy
off
white
head
on
it
there
was
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
malt
with
some
notes
of
the
rye
and
grassiness
also
nice
taste
i
expected
some
sweetness
from
the
aroma
and
got
none
the
rye
is
dominant
in
the
flavor
maybe
a
hint
of
graininess
and
citrus
also
some
bitterness
to
it
a
nice
brew
t
the
rye
taste
certainly
comes
through
bold
it
has
a
hot
cerealoatmeal
taste
bland
in
a
way
but
very
smooth
with
a
good
bite
at

decent

is
a

the
taste
is
a
nice

against
a
nice

backbone
very
enjoyable
the
beer
is
rather
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
very
well
hidden

this
one
was
much
better
than
i
expected
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
d
i
took
down
the
22oz
bottle
of
this
but
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
more
than
that
in
a
sitting
what
does
rasta
have
to
do
with
rye
d
after
several
dipa
and
ris
beers
in
the
past
couple
days
this
was
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
the
beer
was
very
balanced
and
although
its
7
5
seemed
very
sessionable
i
could
easily
see
this
as
a
regular
if
it
was
available
locally
3
5
d
not
bad
but
there
are
plenty
better
examples
out
there
d
an
ok
beer
but
the
smell
was
very
disappointing
it
just
seemed
musty
and
off
but
the
taste
had
some
decent
bitter
citrus
hops
probably
would
give
another
shot
in
hopes
the
smell
is
just
off
in
this
one
bottle
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
impressive
to
me
but
i
enjoy
the
style
those
who
arent
a
fan
of
the
style
might
just
want
to
try
it
but
i
will
continue
to
purchase
it
i
guess
i
didnt
love
this
the
first
time
i
tried
it
in
the
bottle
but
i
like
this
a
lot
and
will
drink
it
again
and
again
an
easy
drinker
with
a
nice
little
hop
profile
no
problem
cutting
through
this

another

please
d
good

spicy
dry
warm
which
would
go
great
in
the
early
fall
months
easy
to
consume
with
an
intriquing
rye
character
that
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
if
you
like
rye
beers
this
is
worth
a
shot
plus
some
of
the
proceeds
go
to
charity
winwin
d
i
could
drink
quite
a
lot
of
this
but
its
just
not
good
enough
to
want
more
than
the
bomber
i
have
i
would
come
back
to
it
but
likely
not
seek
it
out
i
get
some
grassy
slightly
citric
hops
and
caramely
toasty
malts
in
the
flavor
but
it
drops
off
pretty
quick
after
that
there
is
some
rye
but
not
sure
i
would
have
been
able
to
pick
it
up
had
it
been
a
blind
tasting
has
an
earthy
feel
to
it
that
i
am
not
liking
in
a
rye
carbonation
is
mediumlow
and
mouthfeel
is
neither
thin
nor
creamy
somewhere
in
the
middle
the
minerals
and
carameltoast
play
give
it
a
slightly
british
flavor
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexities
for
a
7
5
rye
ale
just
kinda
meh
for
me
seems
to
lack
any
crispness
on
the
palate
and
feels
dull
and
lifeless
i
do
like
the
name
and
label
but
the
beer
is
just
ok
founders
red
rye
it
is
not
cheers
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
a
fantastic
one
lacking
in
key
areas
for
quaffing
namely
texture
and
finish
extremely
drinkable
crisp
and
smooth
and
hiding
its
alcohol
very
well
feels
rather
akin
to
a
good
pilsener
the
sharp
hop
note
and
the
slight
spice
the
lack
of
sweetness
the
crispness
it
all
adds
up
to
a
beer
that
goes
down
easily
bringing
enjoyment
on
the
way
drinkability
is
better
than
expected
not
to
overdone
on
the
rye
very
malt
and
balanced
overall
impression
bwai
ya
done
know
seh
mi
deya
gwaan
easy
and
this
was
easy
to
drink
not
the
rye
monster
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
was
tasty
it
was
like
a
sweet
ipa
but
that
wasnt
bad
this
brew
was
irie
f
a
slight
lingering
malty
sweetness
accompanies
the
lingering
rye
taste
and
bitterness
more
pale
hop
flavors
come
out
but
it
actually
seems
to
wane
a
little
on
the
finish
the
juicy
malt
and
hop
flavors
stick
around
for
a
bit
too
letting
the
nice
flavor
content
linger
the
rye
lingers
lightly
for
a
couple
minutes
after
the
swallow
so
it
definitely
delivers
overall
a
really
nice
beer
a
great
malt
and
rye
flavor
overall
a
decent
hop
character
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
from
the
hype
i
got
from
it
md
medium
bodied
a
bit
creamy
drinkability
is
very
good
never
taste
the
alcohol
smooth
and
enjoyable
very
solid
beer
an
attractive
copper
colored
beer
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
excellant
retention
a
large
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
rastafa
rye
is
suppose
to
have
rye
in
it
but
i
could
not
really
detect
any
what
i
do
detect
is
sweet
citrus
hops
not
much
else
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
features
more
hop
flavors
with
sweet
malts
just
the
slightest
rye
spice
in
the
finish
bitterness
is
moderate
i
would
of
liked
to
bump
up
the
score
for
mouthfeel
because
of
the
wonderful
carbonation
but
i
cannot
because
the
body
feels
too
thin
the
lack
of
rye
does
not
distract
from
the
other
good
tastes
in
the
beer
worth
a
try
d
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
nose
and
so
i
have
to
rate
this
slightly
less
drinkable
aroma
is
intensely
hoppy
grapefruit
and
floral
on
the
palate
an
immediate
sour
tang
from
the
rye
malt
with
full
bitterness
delivered
along
witha
hint
of
spice
long
tart
bitter
finish
really
well
done
rye
beer
but
the
bitterness
becomes
a
bit
exhausting
to
the
palate
after
a
while
hopheads
should
like
this
one
food
or
cheese
helps
refersh
the
palate
while
drinking
skål
drinks
wellenough
goes
down
too
quickly
but
on
the
caramellytoffeeish
side
rye
on
the
subtle
side
hop
character
changes
a
bit
from
the
nose
to
the
palate
reasonably
priced
this
one
is
certainly
worth
the
purchase
to
try
it
i
dont
know
if
id
take
it
as
a
compliment
if
i
was
a
rastaman
that
they
dedicate
this
beer
to
honor
the
culture
but
id
only
buy
it
again
if
i
was
planning
on
getting
drunk
and
cause
of
the
cool
bottle
honestly
this
tastes
like
a
denny
con
spelling
sorry
bud
ryepa
thats
all
over
internet
homebrew
forums
only
rastafa
isnt
nearly
as
good
this
is
one
case
where
bigger
definitely
isnt
better
as
the
lively
rye
spice
gets
weighed
down
by
too
thick
malt
just
be
yourself
lil
feller
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
hoppy
with
more
hops
than
malt
but
still
balanced
there
is
caramel
pine
citrus
and
bread
the
appearance
is
light
brown
with
a
foamy
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
bitter
but
not
too
astringent
finish
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
d
pretty
solid
brew
and
certainly
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
out
even
though
i
knew
it
was
not
my
favorite
style
brew
had
a
nice
look
to
it
copper
color
with
amber
highlights
somewhat
cloudy
nice
sized
offwhite
head
which
has
good
retention
and
left
very
good
lacing
aroma
is
nice
has
a
fair
spice
scent
to
it
which
i
would
imagine
was
from
the
rye
but
could
the
hops
also
be
adding
a
bit
to
it
also
has
a
sweet
smell
that
reminds
of
caramel
comes
through
faintly
the
flavors
as
with
the
aroma
of
this
brew
are
very
good
i
have
not
had
many
rye
beers
in
the
past
but
so
far
i
am
impressed
nice
malt
character
with
the
rye
spice
it
is
the
rye
which
really
makes
this
beer
imo
as
it
mixes
well
with
the
base
malts
which
seem
to
give
a
flavor
similar
to
what
i
noticed
in
the
aroma
hops
really
go
along
well
with
the
spicy
rye
notes
drink
ability
on
this
beer
is
very
good
goes
down
early
over
all
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
blue
point
and
a
style
that
i
will
have
to
look
into
more
this
beer
and
founders
reds
rye
are
my
favorite
rye
beers
so
far
d
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
rye
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
im
going
to
have
to
hold
a
rye
beer
tasting
at
some
point
to
really
nail
down
the
style
but
so
far
i
love
what
ive
had
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
killer
no
alcohol
apparent
if
i
didnt

it

delivered
on
its

nothing
against
this

it

glass
with
nearly
zero
head
or
lacing
smelled
of
sweet
orange
very
little
malt
and
very
very
feint
caraway
seeds
tasted
of
syrupy
sweet
oranges
and
pineapples
with
nearly
no
rye
essence
whatsoever
and
no
malt
balance
either
mediumbodied
with
a
decent
carbo
presence
drinkable
not
really
by
my
standards
one
of
the
more
overrated
beers
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
if
you
want
a
truly
superb
rye
beer
visit
a
triumph
brewery
njpa
despite
the
chain
association
that
places
best
beer
hands
down
is
their
rye
beer
and
quite
possibly
it
could
be
the
best
rye
beer
ive
ever
had
the
drink
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
slickish
in
feel
and
to
be
more
my
liking
would
probably
benefit
from
just
a
spritz
more
carbonation
a
pretty
easy
drinker
nonetheless
drinkability
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
slightly
above
average
pale
ale
the
rye
is
not
overly
pronounced
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
better
ryes
could
have
two
max
the
taste
is
typically
rye
there
is
a
dry
slightly
biting
non
hop
bitterness
a
bready
underneath
and
just
very
little
sweetness
present
the
beer
has
the
bitterness
and
sourdough
character
of
seeded
rye
bread
there
is
a
slightly
bitterish
minty
flavor
on
the
back
end
again
there
is
no
sweetness
or
real
hop
bitterness
to
the
beer
just
biting
malts
from
the
rye
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
leaf
in
the
finish
once
the
beer
settles
a
bit
and
it
may
account
for
some
of
that
minty
taste
im
getting
the
aftertaste
is
quite
dry
too
this
is
good
for
the
style
which
may
not
be
to
everyones
taste
not
too
sweet
nicely
hopped
very
good
balance
great
drinking
brew
i
am
liking
this
nice
one
poured
a
color
of
orange
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
looks
just
like
the
appearance
of
an
ipa
a
bit
yeasty
and
hoppy
on
the
taste
but
not
as
hoppy
as
the
bear
republic
rye
beer
mouthfill
was
excellent
due
to
the
perfect
carbonation
dangerously
drinkable
before
you
knew
it
three
to
four
bombers
are
already
gone
fairly
sweet
and
pretty
light
for
a
rye
pa
but
sippable
soft
intro
to
the
style
a
solid
beer
certainly
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
blue
point
pours
an
amber
orange
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
stickage
on
the
glass
some
spicy
rye
in
the
nose
a
pungent
and
bitter
hop
aroma
and
a
sweet
biscuity
malt
back
round
spicy
and
hop
forward
with
a
balancing
malty
sweetness
mid
palate
moving
long
on
to
the
finish
not
bad
a
ryepa
with
a
true
rye
character
worth
a
shot
d
at
7
5
abv
this
could
be
a
dangerous
session
brew
but
where
is
the
alcohol
hiding
this
rye
beer
isnt
exactly
bursting
with
dextrose
or
stringent
alcohol
flavors
would
make
a
nice
pickup
as
a
bomber
and
a
must
try
on
tap
a
hoppy
fruity
peach
citrus
tasting
cask
that
worked
well
on
cask
which
came
in
at

a

with

to
add
complexity
caramel
brings
up
the
mouthfeel

is
good
good

nice
for
the

flavor
that
is

by
hops
and
a

finish
mouthfeel
contains
more
of
the
same
with
that
spice
lingering
along
with
some
of
the
aforementioned
fruit
drinkability
is
just
above
average
the
abv
does
present
itself
and
with
the
spice
and
dryness
of
how
it
finishes
one
bomber
of
rastafar
alongside
a
meal
is
all
i
need
d
very
good
allinall
an
enjoyable
rye
beer
with
the
rye
playing
more
than
a
supporting
role
i
like
bear
republics
hop
rod
rye
better
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
overall
my
favorite
blue
point
beer
so
far
and
even
better
it
comes
in
a
bomber
a
solid
rye
ipa
like
beer
im
pleased
with
this
beer
all
around
a
big
thanks
go
out
to

throwing
in
this
extra

for
a
pint
appeared
a
slightly
hazy
amberred
with
a
low
head
the
aroma
was
a
simple
caramel
with
a
hint
of
oxidation
the
flavor
however
takes
that
same
caramel
and
follows
with
a
good
punch
of
crushed
pepper
and
spice
the
rye
really
kicks
in
for
the
aftertaste
very
nice
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
the
malted
rye
thank
you
blue
point
overall
sweet
and
spicy
face
off
pretty
nicely
here
the
hops
and
rye
arent
surprising
but
definitely
pleasant
and
assertive
while
the
crystal
malt
lends
enough
to
leave
it
quite
balanced
a
little
bready
i
would
love
to
have
more
aggression
here
from
the
rye
but
that
wouldnt
be
very
rastalike
would
it
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
with
a
tingly
finish
above
average
drinkability
but
not
earthshaking
recommended
a
solid
layer
of
thick
head
across
the
top
a
deep
golden
orange
color
lacing
along
the
edge
of

some
lethargic
bubbles

d
the

certainly
makes
a

huge
billowing

lacing

are
decent
all
around
i
get
huge
aromas
of
hop
and
rye
here
very
well
balanced
the
hops
are
citrusy
and
juicy
taste
brings
out
the
nice
rye
flavorings
bold
and
bready
a
bit
on
the
spicy
side
as
well
this
taste
almost
like
rye
bread
dipped
into
a
huge
pot
of
grapefruit
and
oranges
hops
blend
almost
perfectly
to
the
rye
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
decently
carbonated
and
very
firm
on
the
tongue
i
get
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
here
from
the
hops
as
well
overall
drinkability
is
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
goes
down
like
your
traditional
ipa
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
blue
point
and
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
out
there
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelf
make
sure
you
grab
some
very
good
drinkability
an
enjoyable
brew
more
so
in
the
22
oz
side
d
the
rye
in
this
beer
isnt
as
pronounced
as
some
others
ive
had
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
nicely
balanced
great
texture
and
fairly
robust
beer
another
solid
offering
from
blue
point
pours
a
clear
visibly
effervescent
light
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
loose
foamy
head
that
resists
fading
sheets
of
belgian
lacing
left
in
the
wake
of
each
mouthful
compensate
for
the
overly
light
color
the
smell
is
unusually
light
and
hoppy
for
the
style
but
the
grainy
rye
element
is
distinct
over
the
notes
of
citrus
highly
carbonated
the
mouth
is
tangy
bright
and
light
bodied
full
flavored
the
flavor
is
hoppy
lemon
and
grainy

reasonable
drinker
happy
10th
rastafa
rye
ale
poured
out
with
a
sharp
golden
color
with
some
dark
yellow
filling
in
the
gaps
a
beautiful
white
head
came
up
with
some
vigor
but
was
short
lived
leaving
a
small
cap
nice
spots
of
lacing
rings
the
smell
was
decent
and
low
with
a
small
hop
build
malts
are
the
focus
with
some
bisquit
like
smell
only
picking
up
a
bit
of
rye
this
needs
something
more
the
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
bready
malt
first
then
some
flavoring
hops
which
were
light
and
grassy
mixed
in
with
some
grain
ive
had
better
and
more
pronounced
rye
beers
the
feel
is
pretty
much
in
the
middle
with
a
touch
of
carb
it
went
down
crazy
easy
without
a
hitch
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
but
i
did
not
pick
up
any
i
could
of
drank
the
whole
bomber
easy
just
ok
for
me
to
quote
a
famous
american
idol
judge
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
5
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
at
least
two
fingers
of
bone
white
head
not
much
head
retention
but
it
manages
to
leave
behind
a
thin
lace
on
the
inside
of
my
glass
with
each
sip
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
a
very
pronounced
peppery
spiciness
followed
by
notes
of
light
to
medium
toasted
grains
bready
a
touch
of
caramelized
malts
the
spiciness
comes
back
into
play
finish
is
super
dry
with
a
fading
bitterness
the
ale
falls
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
did
i
mention
the
dry
finish
a
decent
attempt
by
blue
point
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
if
i
see
this
on
tap
ill
certainly
try
it
out
but
at
5
a
bomber
this
certainly
isnt
a
great
value
beer
and
it
drinks
much
more
like
a
six
pack
beer
than
one
that
belongs
in
a
bomber
but
part
of
the
proceeds
go
to
a
charity
benefiting
underprivileged
children
in
the
caribbean
so
you
can
feel
good
about
that
overall
this
wont
knock
your
socks
off
with
any
huge
flavors
its
just
a
solid
beer
overall
solid
good
big
ryepa
i
would
have
no
problem
trying
it
again
though
i
hesitate
to
say
i
would
actively
seek
it
out
two
thumbs
up
for
the
jamaican
theme
and
the
fact
that
part
of
the
proceeds
are
donated
to
orphaned
and
underprivledged
children
of
the
caribbean
this
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
moderate
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
rye
and
sour
yeast
with
copper
and
lemon
hops
and
a
bit
of
roasted
barley
it
tasted
like
lots
of
spicy
rye
and
copper
hops
with
some
roasted
barley
and
sour
yeast
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
great
spicy
rye
character
with
a
great
body
it
had
no
real
noticeable
alcohol
either
and
it
wasnt
too
bitter
so
it
was
perfectly
easy
to
drink
this
maybe
wasnt
the
biggest
or
boldest
beer
but
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
worth
buying
again
d
an
interesting
brew
the
rye
dominants
as
it
should
in
a
rye
beer
however
there
isnt
much
else
this
is
a
one
trick
brew
though
its
a
pretty
good
trick
i
found
that
this
beer
made
me
feel
stuffy
an
okay
rye
stout
but
not
up
to
par
with
terrapin
or
bear
republic
easy
drinking
and
tatsy
drinkability
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
its
a
relatively
straightforward
but
solid
beer
a
little
too
buttery
and
too
thick
but
on
the
whole
pleasant
not
too
alcoholic
and
entertaining
enough
for
a
single
pint
d
as
i
said
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
either
more
malt
presence
or
more
hops
overall
a
good
beer
to
try

the

in

love

a
beer
that
was
somewhat
interesting
and
strayed
from

disipated
into
a
nice
fluffy

a
somewhat
grainy

with

with

could
use

but
still
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
out
of
blue
point
d
had
a
pint
of
this
but
i
could
go
for
more

really
nice

again
i
am
glad
that
i
am

get

character
is
certaintly

to

even
wo
da

shinin
tru
this
one
remains
tasty
and
enjoyable
basically
comes
off
like
a
decent
craft
amber
ale
while
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
hop
rye
and
blue
dot
dipa
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
one
that
would
be
especially
popular
with
those
particularly
fond
of
rye
beers
the
rye
flavor
in
this
one
is
really
pretty
pronounced
imo
hv
m
d
a
little
prickle
of
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
it
quickly
mellows
out
and
becomes
more
sparkling
and
pleasant
a
bit
of
a
slick
feel
to
the
body
which
id
put
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
finishes
clean
though
it
does
manage
to
leave
a
flavour
lingering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
for
a
while
after
each
sip
nice
beer
all
around
and
i
believe
ill
be
ordering
another
md
everything
here
is
just
well
balanced
it
doesnt
go
over
the
top
on
any
specific
note
and
the
trifecta
of
rye
hops
and
malts
with
the
subtle
spice
complements
works
really
well
together
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
pale
crystal
and
rye
malts
its
built
like
a
heavier
amber
ale
with
a
mild
rye
spice
to
it
its
also
loaded
up
with
a
really
nice
hop
aroma
the
hops
and
rye
play
off
of
one
another
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
along
with
a
stiff
hop
bitterness
its
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
love
the
bold
rye
character
as
well
as
the
equally
bold
hop
presence

overall
not
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
but
more
than
a
respectable
take
not
the
most
aggressive
version
but
check
it
out
if
you
like
the
style
d
a
tasty
rye
ale
very
easy
to
quaff
but
not
stellar
or
unforgettable
but
a
very
solid
rye
beer
this
is
one
i
would
certainly
return
to
and
enjoyed
w
my
philly
cheesesteak
and
fries
expected
more
but
i
will
buy
again
it
is
really
tasty
very
sessionable
overall
very
little
rye
here
malty
but
needs
more

very
fresh
a
nice
caramel
color
with
a
nice
head
on
it
smells
of
hops
and
some
rye
was
the
aroma
mouthfeel
was
good
for
a
rye
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
but
this
one
i
could
see
getting
a
case
of
a
nice
beer
for
late
winter
almost
spring
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
amber
with
a
1
fingered
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
has
large
notes
of
hops
with
a
large
amount
of
maltrye
in
it
as
well
a
very
smoothe
tasting
brew
very
similar
to
hop
rod
rye
a
large
hop
flavor
balanced
beautifully
with
the
rye
and
barley
a
nice
and
creay
mouthfeel
with
a
good
carbonation
level
for
a
cask
extremely
drinkable
and
this
will
be
a
everyday
beer
for
me
as
long
as
it
is
available
o
a
must
try
on
par
with
its
competition
in
ryes
this
is
strikes
me
as
a
different
kind
of
take
on
rye
beers
there
is
an
interesting
slightly
spicy
earthy
thing
going
on
as
opposed
to
the
direct
spiced
tones
that
a
lot
of
rye
beers
seem
to
have
hearty
i
kinda
dig
it
and
frankly
i
wish
there
were
more
rye
beers
around
there
to
try
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
23
finger
dense
off
white
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thick
cap
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
there
was
a
slow
cascade
of
carbonation
as
i
poured
this
aromas
of
big
pine
rye
spiciness
biscuit
herbal
caramel
and
citrus
some
nice
and
well
balanced
aromas
taste
of
big
rye
spiciness
caramel
biscuit
herbal
grapefruit
pine
and
earthiness
strong
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
rye
spiciness
biscuit
caramel
and
citrus
for
a
bit
good
balance
of
flavors
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
and
very
enjoyable
rye
offering
apparently
this
bottle
was
a
bit
old
but
it
held
up
nicely
d
very
drinkable
the
rye
flavor
was
a
bit
weaker
than
expected
and
overall
the
flavors
are
a
bit
unbalanced
and
rough
o
c
or
b
on
this
one
its
another
interesting
beer
from
shorts
i
guess
this
one
is
more
drinkable
to
the
fruity
ones
they
make
but
still
not
a
fan
i
have
to
say
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
tasted
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
for
those
who
didnt
like
i
think
you
most
likely
are
drinking
old
beer
or
got
a
bad
bottle
bc
there
was
nothing
unappealing
about
this
beer
in
taste
smell
or
appearance
in
my
book
just
my
opinion
beginning
to
think
i
just
dont
like
shorts
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
appeals
to
me
overall
if
this
beer
could
do
anything
about
the
aroma
it
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
improve
the
brew
i
found
it
took
the
whole
experience
down
with
it
the
beer
is
pretty
decent
but
every
sip
introduces
itself
with
a
foul
smell
i
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
more
of
these
if
they
did
something
to
change
it
o
just
an
atrocious
aroma
the
flavor
was
better
but
not
by
much
m
very
chewy
a
malt
explosion
the
late
hop
infusion
doesnt
change
the
ryecentric
nature
if
you
like
rye
you
should
enjoy
this
one
the
rye
gets
center
stage
good
introduction
for
those
unfamiliar
with
ryes
it
has
the
allure
and
familiarity
of
a
pale
but
allows
you
to
enjoy
the
rye
flavors
as
the
sips
taper
off
sad
i
only
got
to
enjoy
a
single
bottle
rye
rye
everywhere
creeping
in
my
underwear
this
is
a
drinker
excellent
beer
joe
im
going
to
need
more
of
this
next
summer
now
that
i
know
how
good
it
is
the
remaining
bottles
wont
survive
long
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
earthy
hop
presence
up
front
that
provides
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
malt
backbone
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
floral
and
earthy
with
some
pine
and
soil
notes
vegetal
with
a
funky
farmhouse
feel
countered
by
a
sweet
malt
backbone
which
is
a
touch
too
strong
hints
of
rye
caramel
toffee
and
biscuit
an
interesting
experiment
but
its
somewhere
in
between
a
hoppy
golden
ake
rye
pa
and
a
farmhouse
ale
abv
well
masked
and
easy
to
drink
but
a
strange
combo
of
flavors
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
puffy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
foamy
rings
of
lace
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
citrus
zest
malt
and
some
rye
aromas
but
all
very
subdued
taste
is
mainly
of
watery
grains
and
a
medicinal
bitterness
pretty
gross
in
my
opinion
the
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
and
is
somewhat
flat
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
as
the
bitterness
is
very
bracing
and
medicinal
in
nature
o
not
so
sure
about
this
beer
the
flavor
and
aroma
profiles
are
quite
limited
but
what
is
present
is
very
bold
and
assertive
not
bad
but
i
think
id
pass
on
having
another
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
much
going
on
in
it
shorts
usually
pushes
styles
to
extremes
and
this
was
was
rather
ordinary
drink
a
nice
little
beer
hoppy
bitter
rye
forward
so
far
best
shorts
beer
i
have
had
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
unfortunately
apart
from
the
rye
and
slight
hoppy
flavours
there
was
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
the
aromas
were
a
bit
more
promising
but
the
tastes
just
didnt
come
through
the
same
maybe
people
who
love
their
rye
beers
would
really
appreciate
this
one
but
i
just
couldnt
find
too
much
out
of
it
other
than
the
rye
and
slight
hoppy
aromas
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
one
again
and
definitely
not
a
top
offering
from
a
great
brewery
like
shorts
in
my
opinion
o
this
could
have
been
much
better
if
the
bitterness
as
not
so
harsh
lots
of
bitter
without
a
lot
of
taste
or
aroma
i
love
ryeipas
but
this
one
was
a
let
down
for
me
overall
there
are
other
beers
from
shorts
that
i
do
like
better
but
like
most
of
their
beers
i
thought
that
it
was
pretty
good
the
appearance
clear
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
dominated
by
pine
the
taste
is
quite
unique
the
rye
seems
to
be
fighting
the
hops
as
to
who
will
win
the
pallete
cling
in
the
end
the
bitter
grapefruit
taste
lingers
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
it
is
an
explosion
of
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
m
o
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
and
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
o
its
another
bold
offering
from
shorts
experimental
even
its
not
a
beer
im
going
to
drink
in
quantity
but
it
certainly
fits
the
super
hopped
golden
rye
beer
to
a
t
as
a
big
fan
of
rye
bread
pastrami
or
ruebens
anyone
i
really
like
this
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
lack
luster
beer
i
knew
going
in
to
this
that
it
was
a
rye
beer
i
just
wasnt
expecting
the
rye
to
be
that
bold
and
dominating
i
didnt
hate
all
that
rye
but
it
could
have
been
toned
down
a
little
the
hops
imparted
lots
of
nice
aromas
but
when
it
came
to
the
flavor
all
it
did
was
add
a
really
heavy
imperial
pilsner
like
bitterness
to
it
that
i
thought
was
way
too
much
for
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
it
just
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
if
you
are
a
die
hard
rye
fan
you
may
want
to
seek
this
out
but
other
then
that
it
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
this
beer
and
out
of
all
the
different
shorts
beers
i
have
tried
this
is
my
least
favorite
to
date
i
guess
you
cant
win
em
all
shorts
overall
this
beer
was
a
big
disappointment
perhaps
people
that
are
die
hard
rye
beer
lovers
would
enjoy
it
but
for
me
it
seemed
like
it
was
really
heavy
handed
personally
i
will
chock
this
one
up
to
being
a
poor
beer
from
an
excellent
brewery
i
love
unique
offerings
and
shorts
is
always
king
here
riche
rye
falls
in
line
well
worth
a
try
worth
a
try
if
only
to
observe
the
combination
shorts
achieves
with
a
smooth
creamy
base
taste
and
a
strong
finish
of
hoppy
bitterness
a
very
tasty
beer
try
it
sometime
d
i
was
worried
upon
opening
that
this
may
be
an
infamous
infected
beer
from
shorts
but
after
tasting
i
dont
think
it
is
good
all
around
i
just
wish
about
a
third
of
it
wasnt
lost
down
the
sink
d
great
id
love
another
pint
and
would
buy
a
sixer
definitely
drinkabiliry
is
good
im
a
fan
of
this
one
a
very
flavorful
beer
that
doesnt
kick
you
upside
the
head
with
a
ton
of
alcohol
super
hopped
golden
malt
dirty
road
with
a
dry
mouth
really
carbonated
spewed
over
glass
when
poured
average
for
the
most
part
hints
of
rye
bread
and
saurkraut
just
poured
the
second
half
slowly
it
overflowed
again
not
really
all
that
great
of
beer
by
an
amazing
brewery

pours
a
light
golden
copper
with
a
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
smells
nice
with
nice
zesty
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
taste
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
some
sligt

feel
is
nice
with
good

levels
drinks
quite
well
i
always
seem
to
enjoy
what
shorts
does
with
hops
overall
a
good
offering
but
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
to
round
it
out
d
i
didnt
have
a
problem
finishing
the
bottle
but
its
a
pretty
underwhelming
shorts
offering
perhaps
it
was
better
in
june
when
it
likely
had
more
hop
aroma
stick
with
humalupalicious
very
explosive
head
on
this
one
i
poured
about
4
ounces
of
beer
into
the
glass
and
ended
up
with
one
finger
of
hazy
amber
beer
on
the
bottom
and
an
overflowing
head
im
gonna
assume
this
is
just
a
bad
bottle
lots
of
rye
and
fruity
hops
in
the
smell
and
taste
very
full
mouthfeel
this
was
certainly
not
a
bad
hoppy
rye
beer
here
the
bandaid
smell
in
the
aroma
pissed
me
off
but
is
didnt
absolutely
ruin
things
or
anything
the
heavy
body
on
this
was
really
unique
though
and
im
still
trying
to
wrap
my
brain
around
it
i
would
definitely
like
to
give
this
one
a
shot
on
draft
sometime
though
to
see
how
it
compares
2
5
d
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
anyone
other
than
a
seasoned
ipa
drinker
and
even
then
its
still
a
bit
tough
to
get
all
the
way
through
mouth
destroyingly
bitter
good
hop
flavor
but
much
of
the
rest
is
covered
up
by
hops
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
rye
malt
and
piney
hops
sort
of
has
a
pinesol
aroma
i
do
not
know
what
happened
to
the
flavor
has
an
astrigent
flavor
that
is
hard
to
get
past
the
rye
and
hops
do
not
work
that
well
together
maybe
not
the
best
combination
of
ingredients
the
other
malt
does
not
show
up
medium
body
with
a
nice
carbonation
good
texture
the
flavor
falls
short
i
would
not
buy
this
again
drinkable
no
not
very
d
at
first
this
tastes
great
but
the
after
taste
is
kind
of
gross
too
bitter
in
the
finish
but
not
a
delicious
hoppy
bitterness
like
sculpin
or
humalupa
while
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
i
think
id
pass
on
having
it
again
the
beer
tastes
kind
of
bland
to
me
theres
definitely
a
lot
of
peppery
rye
but
its
missing
balance
as
there
are
no
sweet
flavors
from
the
malts
or
fruitiness
from
the
hops
kind
of
a
dud
tastewise
the
bodys
a
little
heavier
than
anticipated
too
odd
at
such
a
low
abv
with
so
little
sweetness
worth
a
try
but
only
once
good
stuff
i
enjoyed
richs
rye
but
it
seems
like
the
bar
for
hoppy
beers
is
raised
higher
and
higher
everyday
and
as
such
i
cant
give
it
too
great
a
rating
still
im
glad
its
occupying
my
glass
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
i
need
to
try
another
bottle
with
better
carbonation
the
beer
pours
a
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
rye
toffee
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
rye
toffee
and
some
citrus
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
pretty
good
beer
and
nice
to
see
something
from
shorts
that
wasnt
infected
d
this
beer
wasnt
horrible
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
it
needs
either
more
of
a
malt
presence
or
less
of
a
hop
presence
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
was
too
overwhelming
d
this
is
a
good
time
to
time
beer
when
i
would
really
want
a
dry
bitter
palate
dominator
i
would
not
want
to
session
this
however
a
solid
brew
however
d
i
want
to
state
upfront
that
i
like
hoppy
beers
for
the
most
part
that
being
said
this
brew
is
beyond
hoppy
this
is
cheek
gouging
enamel
destroying
tongue
blisteringly
bitter
and
i
cant
take
it
i
appreciate
and
understand
the
effort
but
this
is
just
too
much
for
me
in
every
way
overall
not
the
best
rye
ive
had
but
a
very
nice
effort
poured
like
thick
molasis
with
a
thin
head
amebery
copper
tones
cloudy
and
dense
the
smell
is
super
dank
so
good
it
almost
smells
perfect
a
great
hop
presence
backed
up
by
a
seemingly
smooth
rye
malt
a
great
beer
shorts
delivers
again
and
again
richs
rye
is
no
exception
cheers
pours
a
fairly
standard
and
nondescript
amberbrownish
color
with
a
small
amount
of
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
highly
roasty
with
some
strong
malty
notes
coming
through
as
well
flavor
is
somewhat
similar
but
with
a
distinct
bitter
hop
presence
that
becomes
the
primary
flavor
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
and
not
overly
sticky
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
necessarily
seek
out
again
hop
presence
is
through
the
roof
in
the
taste
with
some
mild
grainy
flavors
keeping
a
slight
semblance
of
balance
still
this
beer
is
very
hoppy
with
an
extremely
bitter
finish
despite
the
bitterness
it
is
a
solid
session
beer
and
a
very
easy
drinker
d
went
down
easy
for
a
beer
that
was
so
bitter
yet
another
stinker
from
shorts
one
of
the
most
disappointing
brewers
in
my
state
the
drinkability
is
decent
no
problems
dropping
this
one
down
the
ole
alimentary
canal
for
a
little
in
out
glad
i
snatched
this
up
off
the
shelf
at
ladds
and
co
another
solid
brew
from
the
great
lakes
state
overall
a
good
ale
that
still
tastes
feels
like
a
ampedup
pale
ale
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
very
interesting
because
on
one
hand
it
feels
flat
but
on
the
other
its
very
airy
soft
theres
a
little
hop
burn
on
the
inside
of
my
cheeks
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
maybe
its
the
inherent
spiciness
from
the
rye
malt
i
bet
i
bet
the
ibus
on
this
are
very
high
too
leave
it
to
shorts
to
make
you
ponder
after
youve
consumed
one
of
their
offerings
good
work
on
a
very
unique
beer
in
addition
to
the
astringincy
the
mouthfeel
is
also
downright
chewy
and
not
at
all
pleasant
the
drinkability
is
awful
for
one
bottle
so
what
was
a
candidate
for
a
quaffable
beer
at
4
9
just
doesnt
cut
it
this
was
not
a
beer
for
me
but
just
to
temper
still
love
shorts
keep
pushing
your
envelope
hopefully
in
other
directions
d
got
through
about
half
of
it
then
i
drained
poured
it
it
way
to
bitter
for
me
if
you
like
extremely
hoppy
bitter
beers
then
this
one
is
for
you
but
not
for
me
d
its
an
ipa
but
not
an
ipa
if
you
like
ipas
with
the
abv
on
this
one
you
could
enjoy
one
after
another
i
did
overall
for
being
a
hophead
this
brew
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
loves
the
bitterness
what
got
me
was
the
words
on
the
bottle
supper
hopped
golden
rye
beer
and
comming
from
shorts
with
their
huma
lupa
i
had
to
try
it
d
a
rather
unique
take
on
the
style
that
drinks
very
nicely
full
flavored
and
low
abv
nice
dgood
but
i
wish
all
of
those
tropical
fruits
in
the
aroma
would
come
through
in
the
taste
a
bit
to
sharpharsh
in
the
finish
for
me
a
good
brew
that
with
a
little
change
could
become
classic
o
well
balanced
with
just
enough
spice
from
the
rye
a
good
deal
for
the
price
and
one
that
i
would
try
again
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
rye
ipas
golden
hue
with
a
slight
tint
of
red
beautiful
nose
with
plenty
of
spices
and
earthy
notes
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
balance
of
all
the
different
hops
tastes
of
grapefruit
pine
and
a
wonderful
array
of
spiciness
dry
across
the
tounge
give
this
a
try
doubt
you
will
be
disappointed
cant
rave
enough
my
favorite
goto
beer
balanced
in
all
aspects
nothing
that
overpowers
the
rest
simply
perfect
a
nice
ipa
nothing
great
and
certainly
nothing
wrong
at
this
price
point
it
is
very
good
not
a
lot
of
rye
presence
bought
in
a
mix
pack
o
a
well
rounded
properly
balanced
ipa
well
worth
trying
another
strong
offering
from
harpoon
have
had
this
beer
several
times
love
it
im
probably
biased
in
harpoons
favor
but
its
good
regardless
o
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
it
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
sticky
grapefruit
hoppiness
is
really
quite
enjoyable
but
the
malt
is
a
bit
too
saccharine
and
viscous
to
give
it
a
good
backbone
the
spice
from
the
rye
is
underrealized
too
sierra
nevadas
ruthless
rye
is
a
far
superior
beer
for
the
price
point
overall
one
of
harpoons
best
offerings
and
doubtlessly
their
best
hoppy
beer
ive
had
to
date
would
recommend
for
harpoon
fans

o

outstanding
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
dont
see
it
being
sold
often
down
in
georgia
but
the
next
time
i
see
i
will
pick
up
a
few
bottles
pours
a
bright
orange
color
with
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
good
blend
of
malts
and
rye
grains
some
fruity
notes
from
yeast
and
hops
round
it
out
the
taste
has
mostly
rye
grain
notes
and
a
satisfying
spice
bite
with
the
hops
leaving
the
palate
dry
each
sip
leads
to
a
need
for
another
and
this
beer
was
consumed
in
a
matter
of
fact
fashion
harpoon
makes
decent
drinkable
beers
and
everything
is
well
in
massachusetts
o
pretty
good
offering
from
harpoon
overall
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
if
i
see
it
fresher
always
been
a
fan
of
beers
that
incorporate
rye
so
im
a
bit
partial
o
a
good
brew
id
drink
another
one
taste
is
wellhopped
for
sure
with
elements
of
pine
and
citrus
up
front
the
rye
infusion
comes
through
at
the
finish
with
a
spicy
zing
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
ipa
even
a
few
months
past
its
best
by
date
worthy
overallcomments
i
really
enjoyed
reviewing
this
offering
and
thought
it
was
very
well
done
with
all
aspects
one
would
look
for
in
a
rye
ipa
with
a
nice
complexity
to
it
classified
as
a

a

offering
pours
a

leaves
a

the
smell
is
floral

with
a
hint
of

maybe
a
little
rye
on
the
end
the
taste
leaves
a
little
more
spice
pepper
rye
but
barley
you
also
get
the
hops
pine
and
flowers
but
not
a
ton
of
bitterness
just
a
hit
of
sweetness
in
the
beginning
that
comes
on
more
while
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
a
slight
chewy
wish
there
was
more
bubbles
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
lot
of
rye
more
just
a
ipa
pale
ale
still
good
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
that
took
a
while
to
dissipate
completely
the
primary
note
in
the
nose
is
hops
with
the
rye
secondary
the
flavor
is
the
reverse
of
the
nose
the
rye
is
upfront
and
the
hops
follow
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
followed
with
a
dry
spiciness
from
the
rye
and
a
mild
hop
profile
very
in
tune
with
the
style
but
not
a
standout
in
the
style
o
a
very
solid
rye
beer
very
nice
looking
and
features
a
unique
combo
of
malts
to
give
it
a
good
rye
taste
and
a
very
light
and
pleasant
amount
of
sweetness
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
play
very
well
off
of
this
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
2nd
of
these
from
the
harpoon
winter
variety
pack
nothing
id
actively
seek
but
this
is
a
good
beer
for
any
rye
beer
or
ipa
fans
recommended
o
an
ipa
that
does
not
taste
like
an
ipa
i
expected
enjoyable
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
spiciness
from
the
rye
is
not
overpowering
overall
ipas
are
my
go
too
brews
and
this
ones
a
good
one
6
9abv
is
hidden
in
the
flavor
its
not
upfront
overall
one
of
my
favorites
you
cant
go
wrong
just
had
a
growler
filled
today
at
harpoon
in
windsor
i
have
had
rich
and
dans
filled
in
a
bottle
a
few
times
and
its
consistently
a
good
not
great
ripa
this
brew
fresh
on
tap
is
way
different
pours
a
amber
coppery
color
leaving
a
generous
head
of
foam
i
immediately
pick
up
on
floral
hops
and
bubblegum
smell
is
not
dissimilar
from
the
taste
i
pick
up
on
bubblegum
fading
to
more
of
a
floraly
flavor
with
a
malty
presence
but
not
overwhelming
for
being
an
ipa
its
not
overly
bitter
but
i
may
consider
this
one
to
be
a
bit
chewy
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
ripa
and
i
am
enjoying
this
one
way
more
on
tap
as
compared
to
bottled
if
you
can
try
it
on
tap
i
would
strongly
recommend
it
and
if
you
like
ripas
i
also
recommend
trying
it
fresh
out
of
a
bottle
o
if
you
just
pick
one
up
to
drink
casually
its
manageable
however
its
not
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
to
be
fair
this
was
strong
but
never
really
felt
it
on
its
own
this
beer
was
solid
but
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
figure
out
what
this
wanted
to
be
its
one
i
could
easily
down
a
few
in
a
session
even
though
its
nowhere
close
to
being
a
session
beer
experimentation
can
lead
to
brews
like
this
that
dont
conform
to
a
particular
mold
or
style
but
lead
to
some
tasty
concoctions
to
enjoy
on
their
own
and
this
was
certainly
one
of
them
overall
for
what
it
is
rye
it
knows
what
it
is
doing
ipa
seems
like
a
side
element
it
is
almost
too
balanced
for
its
own
good
would
recommend
for
rye
fans
would
not
recommend
for
hop
heads
o
solid
beer
and
i
love
the
rye
flavor
truth
be
told
however
if
youre
not
a
big
fan
of
rye
flavor
you
might
not
be
impressed
with
this
one
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
clear
brassy
gold
colored
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
lightly
hoppy
flowery
and
lightly
oily
with
an
easy
a
going
all
around
spiciness
and
a
touch
of
orange
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
resin
subtle
rye
caramel
and
spiced
fruit
not
overly
complex
or
anything
but
rather
soft
and
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
with
some
added
creaminess
pretty
enjoyable
clear
amber
and
medium
to
small

nice
looking
but
a

head

aroma
is
fresh
with
light
graininess
lemon
grass
spice

in

spicy

fairly

this

is

pretty
suckdownable
beverge
overall
a
decent
choice
but
maybe
not
in
comparison
to
other
greater
options
out
there
overall
great
beer
wish
it
came
in
cans
harpoon
consistently
interesting
original
dependable
rjt
nice
one
from
these
guys
complex
enough
and
quite
drinkable
good
balance
no
overkill
good
job
hazy
copper
color
with
a
huge
head
that
fell
pretty
slowly
and
left
good
lacing
i
dont
know
what
i
expected
in
the
rye
part
but
the
ipa
part
is
solid
nose
is
pretty
good
with
plenty
of
malt
character
to
lead
you
in
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
solid
rye
taste
is
rye
and
spicysour
with
a
little
citrus
pine
and
grass
its
a
medium
body
malt
and
is
well
carbonated
its
crisp
and
its
not
what
you
expect
from
hop
flavor
because
its
not
hop
flavor
its
rye
get
it
its
wry
it
has
a
palate
of
its
own
and
would
be
great
with
sandwiches
this
was
originally
from
the
100
barrel
series
but
i
had
it
from
a
6
pack
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
slightly
cloudy
copper
with
a
mediumthick
white
head
that
fades
fast
into
a
nice
layer
of
foam
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
spicy
malts
and
some
hops
taste
is
just
like
youd
expect
spicy
rye
malt
and
bitter
hops
in
taste
and
both
through
to
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
a
bit
dry
o
an
enjoyable
ipa
thought
i
dont
get
a
huge
amount
of
rye
just
enough
to
poke
around
the
hops
this
beer
could
also
use
a
little
more
hop
flavor
up
front
rather
than
just
the
finishing
bitterness
m
creamy
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
pretty
nice
ipa
with
the
rye
being
very
noticeable
there
was
just
something
about
the
strange
melon
notes
and
strangely
strong
focus
on
alcohol
for
being
under
7
that
hindered
the
overall
drinkability
for
me
on
this
one
regardless
no
issues
finishing
the
glass
and
i
am
very
appreciative
of
the
chance
to
give
this
one
a
try
thanks
again
matt
overall
not
bad
but
i
have
had
much
better
rye
beers
and
ipas
taste
yummy
yet
flat
as
you
drink
the
beer
the
aftertaste
builds
with
a
nice
musky
grass
taste
which
is
lovely
but
im
missing
the
upfront
hoppiness
that
i
love
from
ipas
good
amount
of
rye
flavor
too
which
im
perceiving
more
as
im
halfway
through
this
bottle
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
overall
a
nice
ipa
easy
to
drink
though
a
bit
too
dry
and
light
for
my
taste
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
more
brewers
need
to
make
rye
beers
definetly
my
favorite
style
right
now
a
good
beer
but
wish
it
had
a
bigger
hop
profile
o
decent
run
of
the
mill
ipa
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
next
time
the
hops
are
very
crisp
and
clean
tasting
with
a
nice
ipa
taste
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
this
seems
a
pretty
mild
rye
beer
decent
level
of
spice
from
things
but
nothing
thats
really
blowing
my
taste
buds
away
flavor
seems
to
drop
off
fairly
quickly
as
well
or
at
least
sooner
than
i
would
hope
for
decent
beer
but
maybe
i
dont
have
the
freshest
sample
o
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
here
from
harpoon
more
of
a
west
coast
approach
compared
to
some
of
their
other
beers
this
demands
attention
and
can
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
rye
in
beer

bit

flavors
start
with

the

doesnt

stand
out
as
much
on

is

sweet
and
nutty
malt
base
wich
holds
up
well
to
the
hops
there
is
a

feel
to

and
it
has
alot
of
stuff
going
for
ita
little
beefing
up
on
the

and
this
beer
would
be
outstandingas
is
its
still
pretty
damn
good
overall
not
bad
dependable
rye
ipa
characteristics
would
drink
if
offered
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
imagine
but
this
beer
is
solid
overall
the
rye
and
hop
profile
are
both
satisfying
and
keep
this
beer
from
being
mediocre
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
to
this
well
anytime
soon
rye
is
a
hard
thing
to
get
right
they
are
close
here
but
its
a
bit
overfruity
to
me
bah
who
needs
a
notreallyallthatwitty
remark
to
start
a
review
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
zest
light
banana
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
toffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grapefruit
showcasing
a
sharp
bit
of
its
rind
and
most
of
the
malty
backbones
elements
fading
into
obscurity
in
the
back
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
ripa
though
the
rye
character
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
and
the
hops
come
across
sharply
dull
still
it
aint
all
that
bad
really
just
not
all
that
good
overall
a
fair
amount
of
rye
character
and
nice
citrus
notes
more
sweet
malt
than
expected
a
very
tasty
offering
by
harpoon
color
is
perfect
for
a
rye
beer
just
dark
enough
to
see
the
colors
of
this
interesting
grain
not
overwhelming
though
nice
spice
and
floral
hops
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
medium
flavor
is
a
combination
of
spice
and
hops
really
nice
had
this
with
some
good
cheese
and
it
was
a
perfect
pairing
i
liked
this
one
thought
the
rye
was
quite
subtle
an
accent
rather
than
a
dominant
flavor
which
works
really
well
in
this
ipa
it
pours
a
lighter
coppery
color
clear
as
day
with
a
medium
white
head
about
an
inch
tall
the
nose
is
spicy
rye
malt
bready
but
light
like
breakfast
with
a
ton
of
citrusy
hops
bitter
and
pungent
i
really
like
the
taste
of
the
hop
blend
here
its
oily
and
sticky
without
being
sweet
in
the
slightest
lemon
rind
and
rye
meet
in
the
middle
somewhere
and
the
result
is
quite
refreshing
body
is
a
little
fuller
that
i
want
it
to
be
id
struggle
drinking
a
6er
of
this
but
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
it
drinks
pretty
well
this
to
me
is
a
perfect
winter
ipa
id
like
to
see
the
malt
bill
cut
down
a
little
bit
to
reduce
body
and
let
the
glowing
hops
take
over
a
little
more
but
the
way
the
rye
plays
off
the
fruity
notes
is
just
splendid
a
really
well
balanced
beer
overall
really
good
stuff
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewer
my
bottle
was
best
before
nov
15th
so
i
can
imagine
this
is
even
better
fresh
ill
keep
my
eyes
out
for
a
fresh
bottle
overall
a
tasty
full
bodied
ipa
overall
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
then
i
am
a
sucker
for
rye
id
consider
buying
a
case
of
this
and
id
enjoy
drinking
it
regularly
o
i
remember
liking
this
but
i
dont
remember
liking
it
quite
this
much
theyve
either
tweaked
the
recipe
and
really
honed
in
on
it
or
im
just
forgetting
how
great
this
beer
has
always
been
i
i
really
like
this
ipa
elevated
flavors
all
over
that
really
resonate
throughout
the
experience
i
will
always
try
this
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
rye
ipa
that
i
recommend
you
give
a
shot
i
will
certainly
be
picking
it
up
again
on
tap
at
the
office
pours
orange
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
orange
fruit
citrusy
hops
and
biscuit
malt
body
is
medium
and
tangy
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
with
citrusy
hops
dominating
biscuit
malt
orange
fruit
and
rye
spiciness
long
grapefruity
finish
fresh
on
tap
very
nice
ipa
a
flavorful
beer
filled
with
minor
flavor
flaws
along
the
way
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
a
good
starter
recipe
to
craft
o
certainly
a
solid
beer
but
not
very
ipalike
all
the
hops
really
do
are
add
some
aroma
and
bitterness
i
guess
the
strength
and
ale
qualities
qualify
but
its
not
typically
what
one
would
expect
in
terms
of
hop
flavor
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
rye
beers
though
d
a
very
nice
beer
from
harpoon
stellar
appearance
and
solid
in
all
other
facets
i
would
gladly
drink
this
with
regularity
my
only
real
complaint
was
that
the
rye
component
only
translated
on
the
palate
and
not
the
nose
overall
a
nice
beer
not
an
eyeopener
by
any
means
but
solid
enjoyed
at
an
endofsummer
clam
bake
on
the
cape
and
it
hit
the
spot
o
nice
beer
here
nice
mix
of
a
solid
ipa
and
a
malty
rye
worth
a
try
as
a
rye
ipa
it
misses
the
mark
but
as
a
straight
rye
beer
its
pretty
solid
o
decently
good
rye
beer
overall
pretty
nice
one
here
adequately
malty
and
balanced
by
a
good
showing
from
both
the
american
hops
and
rye
o
now
that
its
in
six
packs
this
is
likely
to
become
my
go
to
ipa
its
a
toss
up
between
this
and
flower
power
great
job
by
harpoon
on
this
one
notes
drinkable
refreshing
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
o
this
is
very
light
and
very
tasty
the
more
i
have
it
the
more
i
want
to
drink
the
cycle
continues
overall
at
the
end
is
of
the
day
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
rye
malt
in
the
taste
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
harpoon
ipa
glass
best
by
81512
indicated
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
got
this
one
in
right
under
the
wire
pours
a
dull
burnt
orangecopper
with
a
loose
half
inch
offwhite
head
and
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
broken
slick
that
coalesces
around
the
shoulders
of
the
glass
some
delicate
strands
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
initially
expresses
pine
and
citrus
before
yielding
a
hint
of
caramel
and
earthy
malts
taste
is
earthy
malts
and
hops
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
medicinal
finish
all
the
nuances
of
the
nose
seem
to
drop
out
of
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
a
light
palatecleansing
acidity
overall
a
bit
lackluster
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
again
mouth
feel
is
about
medium
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
interesting
rye
brew
i
enjoyed
it
again
more
hops
would
have
been
great
but
i
did
get
that
chewy
rye
grain
flavor
which
is
a
good
thing
definitely
more
interesting
than
their
normal
ipa
with
a
deeper
range
of
flavors
and
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
still
needs
a
boost
in
the
hop
flavor
department
the
rye
keeps
things
interesting
but
almost
drags
the
beer
down
with
its
rough
spicy
flavors
enjoyed
one
or
two
but
wasnt
sure
i
was
ready
for
a
third
because
of
the
rye
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
amazingly
balanced
nose
it
smells
just
as
you
would
expect
for
a
rye
ipa
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
robust
as
you
would
expect
but
this
guy
still
hits
the
style
on
the
head
in
every
department
making
for
a
nice
prototype
for
this
emerging
style
above
average
rye
ipa
from
harpoon
vibrant
orange
color
with
large
bubbles
yet
not
overly
carbonated
tasting
i
detect
dusty
grains
and
rye
on
the
nose
some
englisheast
coast
fruitiness
ale
starts
off
on
the
fruity
side
and
then
progress
into
a
dry
bitter
finish
the
rye
is
more
subtle
on
this
one
than
something
like
the
ruthless
rye
in
my
opinion
quite
drinkable
at
almost
7
though
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
oily
i
really
like
how
this
takes
a
little
bit
of
influence
from
harpoon
ipa
and
adds
a
new
dimension
the
rye
adds
to
the
spice
flavor
of
the
hops
which
are
bitter
in
flavor
and
a
little
citrus
tasting
at
times
too
i
like
the
gentle
orange
rind
element
with
hints
of
pine
and
the
malt
adds
a
nice
caramel
tinge
in
the
back
end
overall
i
was
pleased
with
this
ipa
pretty
solid
for
the
style
and
enjoyable
with
a
nice
rye
presence
o
havent
had
too
many
harpoons
and
thats
a
surprise
since
im
from
ma
but
overall
a
quality
ipa
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
i
liked
this
beer
extremely
solid
and
one
that
will
be
a
staple
while
the
hot
weather
lasts
overall
quite
enjoyable
even
if
the
taste
profile
doesnt
hit
all
the
notes
it
seems
the
feel
gives
those
notes
just
the
right
amount
of
ooomph
to
dig
yeah
i
am
liking
this
one
overall
harpoon
really
does
make
some
good
beers
and
even
though
i
dont
love
rye
beers
this
one
is
quite
drinkable
worth
a
try
harpoon
got
this
one
right
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
would
recommend
to
friends
lovely
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
melds
two
of
my
favorite
style
in
a
complex
yet
drinkable
beer

pretty

this
is
a
very

rye
ipa
im
glad
that
harpoon
has
decided
to
release
it
in
12
oz
bottles
i
imagine
that
it
will
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
somewhat
regularly
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
because
of
its
own
take
on
the
style
with
flavors
and
feel
that
appeals
to
me
id
have
it
again
being
that
i
tend
to
love
rye
beers
i
was
a
little
let
down
way
too
much
yeast
and
not
enough
rye
characteristics
just
an
ok
beer
oa
nice
rye
beer
ruthless
is
much
better
carbonation
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
little
bit
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottled
version
rather
than
the
22
ouncer
which
is
the
way
it
was
first
released
best
by
81512
the
pour
is
a
pretty
standard
copperamber
color
with
only
a
short
lasting
head
that
dissolves
to
a
ring
and
a
topping
of
foam
the
aroma
is
alive
with
floral
and
piney
hops
which
overpower
everything
else
although
there
is
a
little
grainy
character
in
there
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
and
rather
smooth
but
not
creamy
the
taste
also
brings
forth
a
huge
hop
character
with
a
biting
bitterness
at
the
end
and
some
grains
nothing
sweet
here
it
will
linger
for
a
bit
after
it
is
finished
im
really
glad
they
put
this
beer
in
6
packs
its
not
that
i
dislike
the
normal
harpoon
ipa
its
just
become
such
a
staple
its
almost
routine
and
boring
at
this
point
this
beer
completely
reinvigorates
the
style
the
rye
is
the
perfect
touch
that
gives
it
that
little
extra
bite
that
makes
the
beer
nerd
in
me
happy
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
doesnt
really
do
anything
wrong
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
specific
way
pretty
much
at
all
the
hops
are
pretty
light
overall
with
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
mostly
but
could
have
used
a
lot
more
aromatic
and
flavorful
hops
the
malts
are
nice
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
the
rye
really
doesnt
come
through
until
towards
the
end
good
beer
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
the
12
oz
offerings
that
are
now
available
in
6ers
o
one
of
harpoons
best
6pack
offerings
and
one
of
their
most
flavorfulinteresting
beers
i
liked
this
better
than
sn
ruthless
rye
great
value
purchase
and
id
definitely
purchase
again
def
better
than
regular
ipa
this
is
crisp
and
refreshing
a
very
nice
ipa
that
showcases
delicious
spicy
hops
with
the
rye
flavor
overall
not
a
fan
i
love
rye
ipas
not
sure
what
happened
with
this
one
gratz
on
the
25
years
certainly
a
good
stab
at
the
rye
ipa
style
big
and
hoppy
equals
fun
and
the
house
character
keeps
it
interesting
taste
is
not
quite
as
good
as
it
smelled
unfortunately
lots
of
rye
bread
with
a
ton
of
nearburnt
toast
hops
show
plenty
of
both
bittering
and
flavoring
kind
of
piney
and
floral
not
bad
not
bad
big
rye
big
hops
i
think
harpoon
accomplished
what
they
set
out
to
do
with
this
one
although
for
me
the
results
are
just
decent
not
lipsmackingly
delicious
the
rest
body
is
medium
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
im
guessing
its
the
rye
but
there
is
a
definite
unusual
grain
note
in
the
taste
that
i
was
picking
up
that
i
couldnt
really
place
overall
this
is
a
decent
rye
focused
beer
but
after
finishing
the
bottle
i
was
looking
for
something
a
bit
bolder
in
flavor
good
for
a
pint
or
two
not
really
sessionable
for
me
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
not
something
that
will
make
you
say
hey
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
o
tastycomplex
sweet
and
spicy
pretty
good
overall
an
enjoyable
version
of
the
ipa
style
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
backup
the
bitter
hop
kick
could
use
more
layers
in
the
hop
flavor
but
still
a
beer
id
drink
more
than
one
of
a
cloudy
yelloworange
brew
with
a
small
head
that
clings
slightly
to
the
glass
i
found
the
nose
to
be
a
welcoming
rush
of
floral
and
citrus
hop
notes
and
fresh
cream
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
i
enjoyed
the
rye
and
grain
flavor
accompanied
by
hoppiness
but
it
was
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
suggested
id
rather
have
a
founders
rye
pa
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
unbalanced
the
malt
is
a
little
light
for
the
hop
character
i
like
most
of
whats
going
on
here
though
from
harpoon
i
wish
this
was
more
available
overall
a
great
beer
i
bought
quite
a
few
bottles
of
this
because
i
had
it
on
tap
and
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
when
they
where
around
i
shared
a
bottle
with
my
old
man
who
isnt
into
rye
beers
or
i
p
a
s
and
enjoyed
it
to
the
point
where
he
was
pouring
another
glass
for
himself
a
great
brew
that
created
great
memories
its
like
an
ipa
with
some
spicy
rye
malts
otherwise
its
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
nice
ipa
with
a
rye
touch
drinks
well
an
enjoyable
brew
almost
feels
like
you
arent
drinking
an
ipa
at
all
this
beer
is
so
airy
crisp
and
smooth
it
kind
of
feels
like
a
pilsner
or
a
light
ale
when
it
hits
your
mouth
but
then
you
go
through
a
series
of
taste
that
is
incredibly
definitive
first
i
felt
like
it
was
an
apa
then
the
rye
comes
in
and
finally
the
additional
hops
at
the
end
to
take
to
the
imperial
level
it
is
amazing
how
the
hoppiness
stays
with
you
but
isnt
dry
or
overpowering
all
in
all
this
is
by
no
means
is
a
session
beer
but
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
light
mellow
and
tasty
well
done
gentlemen
a
great
example
of
the
style
d
overall
a
solid
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
however
given
the
price
and
the
fact
that
there
are
better
rye
beers
out
there
pretty
good
showing
from
harpoon
though
i
just
disagree
with
the
mouthfeel
but
obviously
they
chose
to
make
it
that
way
and
i
think
the
fact
that
they
decided
to
take
a
risk
and
make
this
beer
thick
is
pretty
cool
respect
harpoon
o
this
beer
is
almost
a
case
of
jekyll
and
hyde
what
we
have
at
the
moment
of
drinking
this
beer
is
almost
completely
different
from
what
is
tasted
between
sips
one
is
bitter
and
clean
tasting
while
the
offbeat
between
sips
taste
is
mellow
and
semisweet
this
beer
is
therefore
almost
more
of
an
experience
than
it
is
a
beerbut
it
happens
to
be
a
damn
fine
beer
too
on
tap
at
moxies
poured
a
slightly
hazy
copper
stained

visibly
effervescent

a
deep
frothy

hang
time
and
impressive
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
aggressive
and
complex
fruity
citrus
and
grassy
hop
blend
really
added
a
lot
to
my
overall
impression
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
has
a
hoppy
tang
and
is
nicely
carbonated
there
is
an
enjoyable
resin
aftertaste
that
lingers
appropriately
the
flavor
mirrored
the
nose
and
had
the
grainy
rye
character
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
rye
beers
overall
a
very
fine
drinker
id
recommended
it
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
bright
vibrant
goldenrod
color
with
a
tall
frothy
light
bubbled
head
that
quickly
recedessettles
into
a
decent
film
it
also
coats
the
glass
quite
well
as
the
receding
occurs
citrus
blends
the
aromas
and
stays
strong
throughout
the
nose
amidst
the
smokey
and
grainy
characteristics
along
with
a
subtle
background
hopping
the
flavors
are
heavier
in
citrus
aspects
initially
but
quickly
blend
with
a
roasted
grain
and
dry
hopped
flux
of
flavor
the
blend
actually
keeps
the
overall
flavor
profile
lighter
than
most
ipas
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
resiny
characteristics
of
hops
with
a
strong
jolt
of
bitterness
and
it
translates
into
a
drying
finish
that
is
somewhat
smooth
at
the
same
time
well
blended
flavors
and
a
light
smooth
body
make
this
a
refreshing
brew
bring
on
more
ryeipas
o
a
nice
beer
that
is
wellbrewed
but
lacks
a
little
character
to
push
up
into
the
tier
of
exceptional
beers
a
hazy
golden
grain
color
with
a
sturdy
onefinger
frothy
white
head
and
luscious
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
pleasant
citrus
tinge
with
a
grainy
sweet
biscuit
theme
blended
nicely
almost
a
subtle
spice
idea
here
the
flavor
comes
on
with
orangelemon
biscuit
and
oats
its
wonderfully
creamy
in
feel
with
a
tasteful
tingle
of
carbonation
it
settles
in
with
a
slight
orange
peel
clove
and
a
reasonable
rye
overtone
that
maks
for
a
very
decent
brew
nice
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
smooth
ipa
with
a
nice
bitterness
appearance
is
light
amber
in
color
and
slightly
cloudy
but
certainly
toward
the
clear
end
of
the
spectrum
for
ipas
aromas
were
of
fresh
grapefruit
and
lemon
predominantly
grapefruit
citrus
hop
flavor
with
a
bracing
metallic
finish
this
is
a
very
dry
and
clean
drinking
ipa
with
very
little
sweetness
it
would
be
great
food
beer
good
rolling
bitterness
that
doesnt
scorch
the
palate
or
linger
too
long
rye
maltiness
is
noticeable
but
fits
right
into
the
flavor
profile
somewhat
dense
body
for
an
ipa
rye
tend
to
be
viscous
and
i
assume
thats
why
really
easy
drinking
for
a
close
to
7
abv
i
truly
impressed
by
this
beer
i
think
i
can
easily
say
its
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
harpoon
just
my
opinion
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
i
love
rye
beer
and
i
love
good
flavorful
american
ipas
this
beer
was
refreshing
and
very
tasty
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
as
it
went
down
easy
and
completely
hid
the
alcohol
quite
enjoyable
and
a
beer
that
i
recommend
trying
o
overall
this
beer
delivers
what
i
expect
in
a
rye
ipa
freshness
every
ingredient
that
came
through
tasted
fresh
and
crisp
that
rye
bite
really
kicks
the
taste
buds
from
beginning
to
end
and
provides
a
solid
malt
backdrop
to
the
citrusy
and
floral
hop
dominance
harpoon
delivers
a
very
solid
effort
on
this
limited
brew
if
you
dig
rye
bite
and
hoppy
freshness
this
beer
is
for
you
draught
this
one
poured
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
an
amber
hue
there
was
a
good
sized
offwhite
head
on
it
that
left
a
good
deal
of
lacing
grapefruit
nose
with
a
bit
of
pine
some
rye
also
the
taste
is
good
this
one
is
fairly
bitter
with
grapefruit
and
pine
hop
tastes
most
prevalent
some
rye
taste
coming
through
also
not
a
bad
beer
o
it
was
ok
before
the
oxidized
flavor
hit
but
even
without
it
i
probably
wouldnt
go
for
it
again
thought
that
the
rye
was
a
bit
weak
as
well
overall
a
solid
flavor
mix
with
the
rye
coming
through
nicely
d
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
aroma
with
a
juicy
fresh
hop
flavor
the
bitterness
is
harsh
but
the
flaovr
is
otherwise
nicely
balanced
though
not
as
pungently
hoppy
as
the
aroma
implies
it
might
be
the
rye
character
is
a
high
point
since
it
is
strong
enough
to
be
noticed
above
the
other
flavors
and
doesnt
get
lost
the
way
it
does
in
so
many
other
rye
beers
this
is
perhaps
the
worse
sampling
of
the
100
barrel
series
ive
had
to
date
harpoon
has
shown
time
and
again
that
they
can
do
better
than
this
much
better
i
eagerly
await
the
next
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
with
a
heavy
feel
to
the
body
that
makes
it
a
beer
that
may
get
loose
on
you
it
goes
down
smooth
but
is
something
like
a
heavy
weight
when
it
hits
bottom
then
releases
that
heavy
feel
at
the
end
overall
great
drinkability
smooth
interesting
cant
feel
the
6
9
percent
alcohol
third
beer
on
sat
night
at
penguin
pizza
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
orange
colored
body
nice
sized
white
head
smell
was
hoppy
and
peppery
flavor
really
packed
the
hop
punch
as
it
had
a
plethora
of
ipa
hop
flavor
bursting
at
the
seams
the
addition
of
the
rye
had
positive
and
negative
effects
i
liked
the
rye
for
the
flavor
as
it
lent
a
spicy
and
smoky
flavor
to
the
taste
what
i
didnt
like
was
the
effect
on
the
mouthfeel
it
made
this
beer
way
too
dry
on
the
palate
would
have
been
a
struggle
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
i
liked
a
pint
of
this
beer
but
i
would
not
make
a
night
of
drinking
this
brew
not
smooth
enough
and
too
high
in
abv
o
a
pretty
good
rye
beer
though
the
hop
profile
really
falls
flat
the
rye
grain
adds
enough
character
to
save
the
beer
notes
might
be
a
little
over
the
top
for
some
but
i
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
better
100
barrel
series
entries
in
my
opinion
a
nice
rye
beer
that
lacks
some
of
the
rye
emphasis
and
malty
backbone
that
some
of
its
counterparts
possesses
but
at
the
same
time
has
great
traditional
ipa
characteristics
this
is
a
brisk
one
and
quite
a
chalk
dry
feel
on
the
tongue
a
bit
lighter
than
most
rye
orange
almost
clear
with
a
just
very
very
slight
off
white
head
nose
is
pine
mineral
with
wort
sweet
undertone
very
subtle
the
palate
is
similar
in
that
i
seem
to
get
a
interesting
earthy
and
not
as
sweet
as
most
but
there
is
a
hint
deep
deep
in
the
finish
if
youre
drinking
it
alone
of
fruit
orange
preserve
nice
bitter
earthy
hint
mineral
touch
rocky
not
earthy
interesting
water
character
solid
but
not
exceptional
like
the
series
none
the
less
reminds
me
of
the
smuttynose
ipa
but
broader
and
just
as
dry
between
the
imperial
rye
and
the
100
barrel
rye
theres
a
lot
of
rye
floating
around
at
harpoon
they
must
have
gotten
a
good
deal
overall
this
is
a
good
ipa
though
problematic
in
that
the
rye
flavors
are
not
as
prominent
as
the
label
would
suggestindeed
not
knowing
this
was
a
rye
ipa
i
wouldnt
have
necessarily
known
rye
was
in
it
and
the
heavy
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
did
become
overwhelming
after
about
a
third
of
the
bottle
still
the
hoppy
tones
are
delicious
and
theres
just
enough
spice
to
give
the
beer
a
welcome
kick
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
opinion
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
the
recipe
is
off
a
bit
to
showcase
the
rye
i
believe
that
they
were
going
for
spicy
complexity
in
an
effort
to
compliment
the
rye
malt
but
instead
they
they
took
away
from
it
with
the
hop
bill
all
that
said
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
i
have
no
desire
to
pitch
it
or
anything
so
it
isnt
bad
at
all
i
would
just
adjust
the
hops
if
i
were
them
to
something
more
american
than
belgian
cheers
taste
starts
sweet
lemon
and
spice
in
the
middle
and
pine
hops
comes
on
for
the
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
rye
adds
a
nice
twist
to
the
ipa
style
overall
a
really
good
rye
beer
that
hits
the
spot
high
recommend
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
one
time
release
so
will
probably
grab
another
before
it
goes
away
tap
if
i
can
find
it
oy
this
thing
comes
out
a
nice
orange
with
a
big
old
fluff
top
sportin
three
fingers
the
fingers
stick
nicely
the
nose
is
mostly
rye
piny
hop
fest
its
basic
but
its
good
taste
is
similar
as
well
starts
with
a
rye
upfront
and
finishes
with
pine
hops
its
decent
but
just
about
that
a
little
too
basic
for
my
tastes
a
light
bodied
brew
with
medium
carbonation
good
puckering
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
still
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
its
good
but
nothing
really
stands
out
the
hops
are
more
bitter
than
flavorful
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
it
went
down
easily
enough
but
that
was
more
for
lack
of
taste
than
anything
else
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
no
real
faults
just
doesnt
blow
me
away
i
would
buy
it
again
would
like
to
try
this
on
draft
o
not
bad
at
all
dont
let
the
score
scare
you
its
just
pretty
simple
and
plain
no
strong
smells
or
flavors
not
much
complexity
just
a
pretty
simple
ipa
with
some
rye
like
a
weaker
and
blander
hop
rod
rye
not
an
insult
to
this
beer
more
of
a
compliment
to
how
good
hop
rod
is
nice
rye
grain
flavors
and
decent
bitterness
but
not
a
lot
else
going
on
and
id
like
to
see
more
hop
flavor
aroma
would
drink
it
again
the
flavor
is
aggressively
bitter
with
hop
resins
but
not
so
much
as
to
leave
behind
a
medicinal
twang
rather
the
spicy
rye
character
in
the
grain
bill
finishes
with
a
snappy
dry
malt
note
the
mediumlight
body
is
crisp
and
dry
on
the
palate
with
a
tight
carbonation
level
overall
a
good
beer
from
harpoon
a
little
unbalanced
as
the
delicate
fruity
citrus
and
yeast
esters
in
the
aroma
are
almost
overpowered
still
its
tasty
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
mild
pale
and
rye
malt
scent
its
light
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
the
hop
aroma
good
its
not
incredibly
bitter
but
it
balances
the
malt
aroma
nicely
the
taste
is
good
its
really
smooth
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
the
malt
bill
provides
adequate
complexity
and
balance
the
rye
also
lends
a
subtle
spiciness
that
compliments
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
an
accessible
rye
ale
o
overall
i
was
so
excited
that
harpoon
decided
to
brew
a
rye
ipa
not
so
much
anymore
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
very
special
not
one
id
seek
out
but
can
see
giving
this
to
a
buddy
that
is
just
getting
into
craft
maybe
not
fair
to
harpoon
that
two
of
my
favorite
beers
are
nelson
and
founders
rye
ipa
edit
as
this
one
warmed
the
metallic
taste
vanished
but
all
that
remains
is
an
interminably
long
bitter
finish
totally
overwhelming
any
other
subtleties
of
this
beer
come
on
i
like
hops
but
theres
no
hop
notes
here
just
bitter
bitter
bitter
one
dimensional
in
conclusion
this
beer
seems
to
be
yet
another
great
option
for
ipa
lovers
but
for
people
looking
for
more
of
a
rye
profile
i
would
suggest
looking
elsewhere
very
good
cookout
ale
especially
with
game
meat
o
id
buy
this
one
again
rich
dans
has
some
really
nice
qualities
and
for
hop
heads
it
would
be
interesting
if
harpoon
dialed
up
the
intensity
of
the
aroma
and
flavors
this
one
is
worthy
of
adding
to
the
regular
rotation
of
seasonal
or
year
round
brews
in
their
lineup
the
100
barrel
series
hasnt
been
as
appealing
compared
to
the
leviathan
line
but
this
beer
is
solid
then
again
im
biased
because
the
leviathan
imperial
ipa
is
by
far
my
most
favorite
harpoon
beer
hands
down
stunning
for
an
ipa
as
its
quite
drinkable
but
rye
bother
for
the
price
poured
into
a
nonik
glass
this
is
a
fairly
pale
beer
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
hop
notespretty
normal
for
an
ipa
flavor
is
hopdominated
in
fact
theres
really
not
any
malt
detectable
i
cant
pick
out
any
particular
rye
notes
but
its
very
tasty
none
the
less
it
makes
me
think
of
a
very
clean
wheat
ipa
as
much
as
anything
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
copperred
with
a
minimal
amount
of
off
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
the
rye
but
also
an
equal
amount
of
tropical
fruity
hops
a
earthyhay
aroma
is
subtle
after
jostling
the
glass
a
couple
times
starts
off
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
on
top
but
finishes
off
with
a
tangy
rye
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
smooth
transition
of
malty
fruity
and
bitter
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
almost
copper
color
with
a
stingy
beige
head
that
dissipates
slowly
before
attaching
a
fair
amount
of
lace
to
the
sides
smells
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
fruit
mixed
with
a
spicy
rye
twang
lots
of
toffee
and
caramel
in
there
to
provide
a
backbone
taste
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
up
front
mildly
spicy
rye
followed
by
less
grapefruit
and
citrus
than
i
expected
finishes
kind
of
dry
with
a
long
lingering
citric
bitterness
reminds
me
a
whole
lot
of
harpoon
ipa
but
a
little
creamier
and
a
little
rye
added
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
i
enjoyed
this
one
theres
really
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
theres
not
really
anything
spectacular
about
it
either
good
beer
but
not
great
glad
i
got
to
try
it
okay
this
is
strange
the
first
flavor
i
note
is
pate
its
a
meaty
taste
with
a
note
of
oysters
the
hop
takes
over
in
the
swallow
without
much
more
than
a
bittering
effect
the
body
is
as
expected
and
the
carbonation
is
mildly
elevated
appears
a
slightly
hazed
copper
in
the
body
with
a
billowing
off
white
cream
head
rising
above
the
edges
of
my
gulden
draak
chalice
chunky
sporadic
bands
of
lacing
are
left
behind
with
each
sip
this
is
a
nice
beer
full
on
citrus
and
spicy
rye
interplay
going
on
in
the
nose
enough
base
malt
provides
some
breadcrackers
balance
to
it
but
big
alpha
hop
brings
the
grapefruit
pungency
flavor
wise
its
banging
with
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
which
is
blended
nicely
with
a
breadyspicy
rye
notes
bringing
out
an
herbalgrain
note
to
it
bitterness
lingers
in
a
good
way
on
the
palate
with
nice
slick
hop
oils
flowing
along
ample
carbonation
carries
the
body
just
fine
overall
between
a
nice
brisk
bitter
ipa
and
interesting
rye
spiciness
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
ive
had
from
the
100
barrel
series
in
some
time
pretty
rock
solid
offering
so
solid
that
the
founders
of
harpoon
threw
their
names
on
it
medium
body
a
bit
higher
carbonation
prickly
and
dry
not
a
particularly
great
rye
beer
but
drinks
pretty
smoothly
definitely
not
in
the
same
league
as
nelson
righteous
or
reds
rye
overall
a
tasty
ipa
which
uses
the
rye
as
seasoning
not
a
dominate
characteristic
notes
the
most
forgettable
100
barrel
series
i
have
tried
i
do
understand
that
rye
can
be
unforgiving
and
difficult
to
brew
and
i
have
a
slight
weakness
for
it
but
this
goes
neither
here
nor
there
and
while
not
something
to
send
back
the
brew
is
quite
forgettable
for
me
o
this
is
a
wildly
uneven
beer
not
terrible
but
not
all
that
great
either
flavor
as
well
combines
the
all
of
the
elements
very
well
to
a
great
balance
beer
thats
a
lot
more
interesting
than
the
standard
ipa
andor
many
other
rye
beers
ive
tried
o
overall
a
decent
ipa
not
spectacular
but
good
i
really
like
the
harpoon
100
barrel
series
its
interesting
to
see
what
there
brewers
come
up
with
on
a
regular
basis
looks
nice
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
cap
lots
of
clumpy
lacing
decent
head
retention
i
got
a
whiff
of
grapefruit
and
grassy
hops
during
the
pour
and
wasnt
disappointed
once
i
had
more
time
to
contemplate
the
beer
in
the
glass
there
was
a
slight
pine
resin
edge
to
the
hops
as
well
plus
mild
nutty
and
bready
malts
solid
bitterness
citrus
pith
and
grassy
hops
in
the
flavour
some
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
with
mild
malt
breadyrye
presence
minerals
and
slight
alcohol
good
texture
medium
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
but
it
felt
light
and
creamy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
rye
didnt
add
a
lot
but
i
did
like
the
hop
character
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
spiciness
from
the
rye
is
not
overpowering
i
like
this
ipa
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
thanks
to
my
friend
paul
for
sharing
this
reminded
me
of
harpoon
ipa
for
better
or
worse
the
body
was
relatively
light
for
the
style
but
it
was
by
no
means
watery
and
on
a
summer
day
i
didnt
mind
the
hops
and
rye
blend
into
a
spicy
bread
floral
citrus
mix
thats
quite
pleasant
but
should
be
a
bit
richer
for
an
ipa
it
just
didnt
have
the
same
kick
as
most
7
hoppy
ales
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
full
yet
the
finish
is
harsh
and
unforgiving
the
rye
and
hops
are
too
out
of
balance
for
my
preferences
i
love
good
rye
beers
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
if
your
going
to
mail
in
the
malt
bill
you
have
to
at
least
have
late
hops
additions
for
nice
hop
flavors
but
this
doesnt
have
any
after
making
a
lot
of
great
beers
in
this
100
barrel
series
harpoon
seems
to
have
mailed
in
the
last
couple
if
i
was
rich
or
dan
i
wouldnt
want
my
name
attached
to
this
beer
i
havent
had
a
good
drain
pour
in
a
while
adios
37
pours
a
moderate
golden
color
that
is
mostly
clear
good
white
head
and
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
good
portion
of
rye
along
with
some
floral
and
spicy
hops
the
flavor
carries
the
same
with
the
rye
really
taking
a
step
forward
and
bringing
a
bit
of
spice
mostly
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
feel
as
well
all
is
very
well
integrated
into
a
mediumbodied
brew
with
a
nicelybitter
finish
some
alcohol
detected
afterward
this
was
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
o
ok
at
best
wont
buy
it
again
though
it
did
improve
after
the
palate
adjusted
to
the
metallic
impression
crisp
and
bubbly
medium
body
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
i
do
feel
that
harpoon
could
do
better
something
about
the
hop
bill
just
doesnt
work
for
me
still
though
i
have
no
problem
drinking
it
even
if
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
pours
a
golden
amber
nice
white
head
aroma
is
little
bit
citrus
with
a
hint
of
spicy
rye
first
sip
is
clean
more
piney
citrus
with
that
kick
of
rye
at
the
end
i
would
like
a
little
more
of
the
rye
to
give
this
a
bit
more
bite
as
it
is
its
just
a
toned
down
ipa
with
a
bit
of
rye
in
the
background
this
could
be
a
really
nice
beer
with
a
bit
of
tweaking
not
bad
certainly
an
easy
drinking
summer
ipa
o
overall
i
was
extremely
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
most
important
facet
of
beer
to
me
is
the
taste
and
this
beer
failed
epically
there
i
suppose
i
had
too
high
of
expectations
but
still
nearly
a
drainpour
d
pretty
drinkable
the
finish
is
a
bit
heavy
the
rye
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
ipa
the
hop
profile
is
nice
but
maybe
just
a
bit
too
subdued
o
harpoon
did
good
with
this
rye
ipa
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
hoppy
this
brew
is
i
like
this
more
then
their
regular
ipa
easily
drinks
very
nicely
i
wish
it
was
cheaper
7
50
but
glad
i
tried
it
i
would
get
on
tap
if
nothing
else
amazing
available
or
priced
well
o
a
must
have
for
rye
lovers
went
great
with
italian
food
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
pizza
or
pasta
have
to
admit
i
havent
been
much
of
a
harpoon
fan
but
between
this
rich
dans
rye
ipa
well
they
know
how
to
make
a
fine
rye
beer
this
is
absolutely
whumpmeintheass
excellent
ill
take
one
of
these
any
time
overall
complex
and
interesting
if
not
terribly
appealing
an
unusual
rye
for
sure
worth
a
try
o
i
enjoyed
this
the
cabernet
added
a
nice
touch
and
mixed
with
the
rye
fairly
well
the
hops
take
a
backseat
at
this
point
due
to
aging
would
definitely
have
again
o
very
nice
beer
the
hops
and
rye
play
off
of
each
other
very
well
overall
this
is
a
nice
attempt
at
an
imperial
rye
ale
but
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
my
rye
beers
to
be
less
abv
heavy
if
that
makes
sense
the
large
malt
bill
dilutes
the
quality
spice
and
flavor
profile
of
the
rye
malt
too
much
sweetness
breadiness
and
light
caramel
flavors
are
masking
the
rye
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
will
revisit
anytime
soon
especially
because
they
arent
making
it
this
year
o
really
liked
this
beer
have
been
disappointed
in
the
few
harpoon
beers
i
have
had
so
glad
i
gave
this
a
chance
will
pick
up
more
soon
overall
decent
but
a
little
strange
mixture
of
almost
west
coast
piney
hops
along
with
the
rye
very
different
from
other
ryes
out
there
and
thats
good
and
bad
dont
care
for
the
bubblegum
flavor
it
feels
to
artificial
and
a
tad
to
sweet
decent
beer
worth
a
try
atleast
once
onot
as
good
as
the
sn
ruthless
rye
but
another
solid
rye
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
strong
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
lots
of
aroma
and
a
good
spice
malt
balance
complex
and
strong
but
very
drinkable
especially
as
the
beer
warms
it
is
actually
quite
smooth
and
mild
bottle
poured
a
clear
copper
color
ale
with
a
nice
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
rye
malt
with
light
spicy
notes
and
some
warming
alcohol
is
well
balance
and
enjoyable
taste
is
not
the
most
complex
but
is
quite
enjoyable
with
good
notes
of
rye
malt
with
light
sweetness
and
a
spicy
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
though
some
warming
notes
can
be
felt
simple
and
very
much
enjoyable

a
hazy

presence
a
bit
boozy
in
the

and
in
the
aftertaste

matches
the

with
a
touch

overall
this
runs
on
the
sweet
side
which
covers
the

until
the
swallow
light
warming

very
rich
body
but
it
also
has
an
above
average
level
of
carbonation
borderline
extreme
with
little
rye
to
show
for
it
o
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
with
a
nice
appearance
and
good
rich
creamy
texture
and
flavours
overall
nice
dark
malts
molasses
a
bit
of
rye
although
it
could
have
used
more
imo
touch
of
warming
booze
without
the
esters
i
was
expecting
o
i
really
enjoy
the
imperial
ipa
the
most
in
the
leviathan
series
and
the
first
time
i
tried
this
particular
leviathan
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
it
which
was
last
year
whether
my
palette
changed
or
i
previously
had
a
bad
bottle
its
really
speaking
to
me
this
time
around
this
is
a
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
more
of
and
i
have
a
feeling
it
might
be
fun
to
age
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
this
particular
review
has
been
updated
since
my
previous
entry
in
2011
o
a
bit
of
an
angry
rye
smooth
in
the
end
but
aggressive
in
the
beginning
could
have
one
or
two
but
prolly
wouldnt
buy
their
four
pack
overall
too
boozy
in
the
finish
otherwise
a
nice
complex
imperial
rye
the
rust
colored
body
was
clear
and
the
head
was
one
finger
thick
and
foamy
the
aroma
was
honeyed
and
spicy
which
i
suppose
was
the
result
of
the
malted
rye
use
there
was
a
lot
of
up
front
sweetness
in
the
taste
with
very
caramelized
tone
mid
palette
the
finish
was
spicy
but
nowhere
near
what
it
should
be
for
a
rye
based
beer
there
was
a
citric
hop
presence
but
not
quite
at
the
level
one
finds
in
ipas
the
finish
was
dry
and
on
the
lean
side
the
rye
character
in
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
subdued
for
this
to
truly
shine
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
have
a
sandwich
with
some
turkey
swiss
cheese
and
some
horseradish
mustard
and
a
piece
of
lettuce
and
tomato
o

great

it

alethe
rye

ive
had
a
number
of
these
and
will
continue
to
enjoy
them
as
long
as
theyre
available
o
good
stuff
a
solid
rye
beer
that
puts
the
rye
front
and
center
bumped
the
overall
score
up
bc
i
was
close
to
doing
so
in
a
couple
of
the
categories
crisp
medium
body
mouthfeel
with
a
just
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
finish
overall
imperial
rye
satisfies
my
love
for
rye
beers
but
nothing
quite
stands
out
solid
beer
and
one
ill
be
sure
to
have
again
a
rich
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
comes
through
on
the
nose
right
away
really
nice
blended
notes
of
pine
resin
warm
malts
a
nice
touch
of
buttery
middle
and
a
touch
of
rye
really
well
done
and
this
carries
over
to
the
flavor
perfectly
smooth
effortless
feel
on
this
one
delivers
a
light
hoppy
goodness
with
hints
f
spiced
rye
and
buttery
malts
nice
clean
finish
overall
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
a
simpletasting
brew
with
a
surprisingly
high
abv
maybe
its
waiting
for
the
drunkenness
to
take
effect
to
keep
me
from
yawning
d
quite
drinkable
i
can
see
myself
getting
this
again
in
the
near
future
a
very
good
autumn
brew
o
really
enjoying
this
one
other
than
the
mouthfeel
i
really
cannot
complain
about
much
a
rye
beer
with
a
ton
of
rye
in
it
imagine
that
hope
they
make
this
again
and
drop
the
saison
and
barleywine
and
of
course
bring
back
triticus
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
chewy
gummy
sweet
and
bitter
o
really
nice
its
a
great
change
of
pace
from
ipas
barleywines
and
darker
brews
that
i
usually
drink
it
has
a
nice
candy
sugarbitterspiciness
that
isnt
the
usual
suspect
i
love
how
harpoon
went
out
on
a
limb
with
this
one
clear
and
coppery
amber
in
colour
with
a
thick
cap
of
beige
foam
tons
of
lacing
sheets
and
streaks
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
great
head
retention
looks
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
a
bit
nutty
and
bready
caramel
mild
piney
and
citrusy
hops
faint
alcohol
bitterness
was
sturdy
but
not
prominent
with
a
bit
of
grassy
character
towards
the
finish
bready
malts
a
hint
of
toffee
grain
and
nuts
slight
citrus
mild
caramel
sweetness
slightly
sugary
warming
alcohol
decent
texture
full
bodied
and
lowish
co2
without
feeling
too
heavy
light
grainy
astringency
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
certainly
purchase
it
again
i
love
this
beer
the
appearance
is
like
a
glass
of
bourbon
well
i
had
it
in
a
low
ball
glass
but
the
caramel
glow
and
color
was
amazing
had
a
nice
aromas
some
spice
hop
punch
and
caramel
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
phenomenal
loved
it
loads
of
spicy
rye
kinda
of
like
a
lower
abs
barleywine
nice
balanced
hopslots
caramel
everything
balanced
the
body
was
medium
not
heavy
at
all
loved
this
beer
and
i
want
it
again
i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
the
ratings
so
far
d
things
start
out
promising
with
the
aroma
as
there
is
a
note
of
rye
and
caramel
thickness
behind
some
very
nice
fresh
hops
that
comes
together
in
a
way
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
hoppy
barleywine
the
flavor
sadly
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
the
malt
is
ok
but
it
has
too
much
toasted
character
and
not
enough
dark
sugar
the
real
problem
comes
with
the
harsh
bitterness
that
borders
on
becoming
aspirin
like
in
the
finish
harpoon
makes
some
good
beer
but
the
leviathan
series
seems
to
be
very
hit
and
miss
and
this
one
is
a
miss
overall
a
decent
big
beer
from
harpoon
that
will
be
stored
away
to
see
how
the
rest
of
the
three
offerings
mature
it
seems
like
a
nice
beer
to
experiment
and
age
with
although
i
did
enjoy
this
bottle
fresh
just
fine
makes
me
thing
of
a
ryecentric
really
well
done
esb
which
i
like
another
good
beer
from
the
leviathan
series
not
my
favorite
rye
nor
my
favorite
of
harpoons
leviathan
series
but
a
welcome
addition
much
better
than
the
saison
and
barleywine
they
put
out
d
very
good
9
is
easy
on
the
palate
not
too
complex
but
at
the
same
time
has
a
lot
to
think
about
definitely
a
well
brewed
brew
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
the
series
love
beer
love
life
harpoon
i
like
this
unlike
other
ryeinfused
beers
this
one
seems
to
be
all
about
the
rye
itself
i
like
it
and
you
might
as
well
try
it
