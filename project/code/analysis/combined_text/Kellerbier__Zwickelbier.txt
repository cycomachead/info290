its
very
impressive
a
little
large
and
unexpected
but
really
delicious
for
a
keller
overall
pretty
impressive
it
stands
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
kellerbiers
ive
tried
in
germany
its
components
are
all
distinct
yet
it
pulls
together
as
one
very
balanced
and
rounded
remarkably
drinkable
in
that
its
easy
to
drink
but
also
offers
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
would
probably
have
again
worth
trying
if
for
nothing
else
than
it
is
not
an
oftdone
style
o
a
spicy
peppery
kellerweiss
is
there
ever
was
one
great
smooth
mouthfeel
a
proper
lager
for
sure
super
drinkability
but
borderline
due
to
all
the
herbal
and
peppery
flavors
gives
it
a
real
kick
very
flavorful
for
5
5
as
a
result
sorta
reminds
me
of
a
really
peppery
saison
at
points
overall
a
very
pronounced
level
of
carbonation
but
still
its
a
rather
refreshing
brew
o
this
kellerbeer
seems
to
be
happier
compared
to
other
beers
ive
had
but
still
has
nice
complex
flavors
of
yeast
the
kellerbierzwickelbier
style
is
not
one
i
get
my
hands
on
often
but
this
was
quite
good
and
sessionable
one
i
recommend
trying
as
it
was
tasty
with
a
low
abv
would
love
to
pound
about
10
of
these
on
a
sunny
saturday
afternoon
and
see
what
kind
of
chaos
would
follow
in

its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
od
a

but
decent
for
the
style
i
suppose
enjoyed
the
375ml
format
bc
i
probably
wouldnt
finish
a
750
of
this
spoton
keller
can
easily
imagine
drinking
this
at
a
german
country
brew
house
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
loads
of
flavour
and
easily
sessioned
i
could
pound
this
stuff
for
days
o
an
interesting
and
enticing
mix
of
flavours
super
easy
drinking
a
unique
brew
and
style
overall
im
enjoying
the
kellerbier
i
could
do
without
the
slight
maltiness
but
thats
more
my
preference
for
bohemian
instead
of
bavarian
lagers
and
not
a
knock
on
the
beer
itself
i
think
it
would
go
really
well
with
summer
fare
as
it
definitely
seems
like
a
fine
food
beer
to
me
i
always
like
trying
unfiltered
pilsners
especially
those
on
lees
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
that
style
id
pick
this
up
again
too
revolting
to
drink
more
than
a
few
amazed
sips
this
is
the
newer
label
thats
been
around
for
at
least
a
couple
of
years
11
for
the
big
bottle
im
sorry
to
say
overall
a
real
winner
refreshing
and
elegant
this
can
be
a
good
gateway
beer
yet
still
satisfy
the
discerning
craft
beer
drinker
overall
i
find
this
hard
to
rate
because
i
am
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
trying
to
rate
this
to
style
it
seems
pretty
good
some
nice
and
interesting
flavours
the
slight
sourfunk
is
very
good
however
the
lightness
and
clean
flavour
does
not
work
for
me
since
i
suppose
those
are
part
of
the
package
for
a
keller
bier
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
my
first
keller
bier
and
i
found
it
to
be
highly
satisfying
and
nourishing
i
imagine
this
would
be
perfect
with
lunch
after
physical
work
in
the
summer
however
i
easily
finished
the
entire
bomber
while
reading
in
february
this
is
as
complex
of
a
lager
as
you
are
going
to
find
it
is
tasty
and
worth
repeating

good
stuff
i
was
pumped
to
see
that
a
few
beers
from
les
trois
mousquetaires
landed
in
my
market
but
the
fact
that
this
one
was
underwhelming
at
best
will
definitely
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
pick
up
another
one
of
these
overall
this
is
the
most
enjoyable
kellerbier
ive
had
to
date
i
really
liked
its
fruity
aspect
as
well
as
its
delicate
soft
and
smooth
feel
d
good
beer
and
would
match
well
with
a
variety
of
foods

monster

seems
to

well
made
and

seemed
to
crystallize

fantastic
my
perfect
session
only
my
secondever
kellerzwickel
the
other
being
new
glaruss
excellent
yokel
the
yokel
felt
more
like
what
a
traditional
version
might
be
like
while
this
feels
adulterated
or
more
experimental
and
thats
fine
with
me
still
havent
had
one
from
the
fatherland
so
i
suppose
ive
yet
to
try
the
real
deal
but
i
know
i
like
the
style
based
on
these
two
examples
o
this
is
good
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
banana
is
this
just
a
feature
of
the
unfiltered
kellerbier
style
o
there
is
no
bottling
or
bestby
date
on
this
beer
so
im
not
sure
if
the
mustiness
is
due
to
stale
beer
or
thats
just
the
character
of
the
brewerys
yeast
nevertheless
it
gives
this
beer
an
odd
character
that
might
be
overlooked
in
another
style
but
in
a
pils
its
rather
damning
even
an
unfiltered
pils
the
sweet
fresh
malt
character
saves
this
beer
for
me
and
allows
me
to
finish
the
bottle
but
i
dont
know
if
im
tempted
to
pick
up
another
not
a
common
style
in
my
country
it
sits
somewhere
between
pilsner
and
farmhouse
ale
its
richness
might
be
a
challenge
for
some
but
to
me
it
oozes
goodness
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
beer
is
nicely
refreshing
and
makes
the
tastebuds
happy
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
on
the
whole
a
little
less
bitterness
would
help
but
it
is
still
good
after
receiving
but
a
taste
of
what
ltm
had
to
offer
last
summer
with
their
standard
mixpack
i
couldnt
wait
to
sample
more
of
their
brews
i
can
safely
say
that
their
kellerbier
was
more
than
worth
the
wait
a
markedly
bitterer
and
huskier
kellerbier
than
ive
experienced
before
but
this
robust
flavor
was
certainly
welcome
terrific
work
from
ltm
but
its
very
good
very
funky
and
complex
with
none
of
the
usual
cleaned
up
lager
profile
found
in
craft
pils
the
beer
pours
slightly
cloudy
with
a
hoppy
funky
nose
takes
a
few
sips
to
get
used
to
the
slightly
fruityyeasty
notes
that
come
from
being
unfiltered
very
unique
beer
a
very
delicious
lager
beer
with
more
pronounced
lemonylemon
grass
earthiness
and
unadulturated
heaft
than
usual
its
like
drinking
beer
without
training
wheels
gentle
and
easy
to
drink
but
quite
complex
and
always
interesting
i
am
about
to
polish
off
the
750
an
ideal
partner
for
my
lunch
of
fresh
crab
and
and
mayo
btw
and
wish
i
had
a
lot
more
might
be
one
of
the
best
session
beers
i
can
think
of
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
spots
of
clarity
around
the
edges
about
three
fingers
of
sudsy
and
dishsoaplike
not
in
a
bad
way
head
settles
nicely
with
a
shitton
of
webbed
lace

is
a
bouquet
of
fresh
floral
hops
fresh
cut
grass
and
a
nice
organic
earthy
malt
crisp
biscuitiness
taste
dominated
by
typical
german
pilsner
hops
and
again
the
fresh
cut
grassiness
of
this
beer
shines
brightly
some
more
lemon
zest
and
a
hint
of
some
mint
here
fairly
long
dry
finish
with
moderatelyhigh
bitterness
drinkability
is
nice
i
could
do
this
750
solo
again
some
nice
stuff
from
ltm
drink
a
great
beer
that
i
am
happy
i
tried
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
others
who
like
a
light
but
hoppy
beer
perfect
for
warm
days
golden

a

quickly
no

the
bottle
had
plenty

smells

a

a

good

a

overall
a
good

easy
to

but
with
tons
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
in
some
time
definitely
a
beer
to
seek
out
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
off
golden
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
nice

everywherethe
smell
is
quite
sweet
with
aromas
of
honeyfresh
pollentoffee
malt
and
also
some
musty
vinegarthe
mouthfeel
really
suits
the
style
which
nice
and
full
feeling
with
flavours
of
jarrah
honeyfloral
hopsfresh
barleya
touch
of
mustiness
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
kickoverall
a
nice
drop
that
has
some
tasty
flavours
due
to
the
unfiltration
good
beer
id
drink
it
again
fun
when
you
hesitate
between
a
clean
euro
lager
and
something
busier
my
first
mousquetaires
bottling
and
im
impressed
i
would
keep
this
beer
away
from
more
intense
foods
like
indian
mexican
or
chinese
food
it
will
just
be
overwhelmed
but
it
will
work
wonders
with
grilled
meats
soft
cheeses
or
fish
i
feel
like
the
winter
will
wash
it
away
so
enjoy
it
in
the
sun
and
it
will
treat
you
right
really
clean
drinking
but
lots
of
complexity
to
it
as
well
a
great
beer
to
start
off
a
tasting
session
but
i
could
sink
quite
a
few
of
these
as
well
this
is
a
really
great
keller
and
a
great
beer
all
up
on
the
palate
its
spoton
stylistically
its
so
fresh
and
clear
just
how
a
really
awesome
lager
should
be
but
it
has
masses
of
character
as
well
to
make
it
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
experience
amazingly
refreshing
and
refreshingly
tasty
top
drop
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
kellerbier
very
balanced
and
drinkable
pours
a
bright
hazy
copper
color
with
a
lasting
white
head
aroma
of
bready
malt
lemon
and
an
earthy
mustiness
the
taste
is
lemon
honey
peppery
spices
yeast
and
floralgrassy
hops
medium
bodied
really
good
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
style
so
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
a
750ml
bottle
is
a
bit
difficult
to
finish
off
but
this
is
a
welldone
interesting
beer
delicate
sweet
aroma
of
concord
grapes
and
honey
is
quite
inviting
dense
offwhite
head
sits
atop
the
hazy
golden
beer
delicate
flavor
is
a
mix
of
concord
grape
and
with
faint
floralgrassy
and
lemon
accents
all
wrapped
up
in
a
mildly
bitter
finish
moderately
light
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
light
flavors
make
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
slainte
and
better
luck
next
time
d
pretty
nice
and
easy
drinking
beer
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
brew
if
you
could
find
it
ontap
stupid
ontario
keg
laws
at
least
were
getting
trois
mousquetaires
bottles
in
chicago
now
oh
how
i
wish
i
was
closer
to
a
regular
supply
of
this
beer
it
could
be
a
regular
drinker
easily
quaffable
plenty
of
kick
these
guys
do
a
mean
lager
compared
to
creemore
keller
this
is
10
times
meaner
damn
tasty
big

for
a
session
beer
d
its
easy

is
good
nice

liked
the
big

presence
good
stuff
really
interesting
enjoyable

not
my

the
hell

this
great
beer
poured

and
good

is
a
wonderful

flavors
like
aroma
and
richer

is
great
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
short
length
definitely
a
session
beer
bloody
awesome
lager
very
nice
for
a
regional
example
im
just
looking
for
something
that
i
can
drink
with
some
pizza
and
they
seem
to
work
well
i
can
see
no
reason
why
you
shouldnt
try
this
beer
yet
another
winner
from
a
great
brewery
its
always
good
to
find
a
new
keller
beer
of
good
quality
and
this
from
a
quebec
brewer
fits
that

it
fits
the

a
very

try
the

next
from
these

this
was
flavourful
and
refreshing
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
d
decent
but
the
finish
really
bothers
me
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
full
flavour
that
is
far
from
the
norm
certainly
worth
checking
out
and
makes
me
want
to
find
more

its
all
that
drinkable
ive
never
really
had
a
beer
tasting
like
this
one
maybe
because
ive
never
tried
a
kellerbeer
and
enjoyed
the
first
glass
for
its
uniqueness
but
finishing
this
whole
750ml
is
going
to
be
a
little
hard
its
a
bit
too
astringent
and
bitter
to
have
more
than
one
worth
checking
out
just
dont
plan
on
sessioning
this
one
one
in
a
select
group
of
germanstyle
lagers
that
just
begs
to
be
consumed
from
that
first
moment
of
introduction
ltm
has
nailed
that
concept
so
glad
that
i
have
more
of
it
with
which
to
wile
a
bit
of
warm
afternoon
away
as
this
is
one
equitable
example
of
the
originators
of
the
style
hoppy
biscuity
dry
and
simple
in
the
best
sort
of
way
not
much
more
to
say
here
i
suppose
other
than
some
bigups
to
those
quebecois
fellas
who
thought
this
might
be
a
good
idea
to
pursue
in
the
first
place
i
just
polished
off
a
750
ml
bottle
and
id
happily
move
on
to
another
excellent
bier
would
seek
this
very
unique
balanced
flavorful
delicious
and
just
the
right
abv
7
5
o
i
quite
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
seek
it
out
again
really
cool
label
on
the
bottle
and
really
cool
beer
inside
very
different
from
the
typical
hoppy
american
lager
actually
quite
good
voodoo
calls
it
a
pilsner
but
its
still
good
well
worth
buying
again
a
really
amazing
beer
the
combination
of
hops
and
pilsner
is
great
the
beer
is
not
bitter
at
all
and
not
overly
hopped
not
a
strong
smell
to
it
but
the
hop
flavors
are
definitely
in
there
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
little
hop
aftertaste
but
again
it
is
not
bitter
it
is
more
of
a
floralspice
taste
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
hops
taste
is
well
hopped
piney
a
bit
spicy
some
malts
not
bad
but
over
hopped
for
the
style
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
id
happily
drink
it
again
but
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
an
incredible
american
take
on
the
style
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
zest
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
grassy
qualities
pours
into
a
becker
a
dull
medium
golden
with
a
large
blooming
white
head
that
settles
very
slowly
into
a
soapylike
mass
leaving
multiple
broken
rings
of
lace
behind
grainy
with
honey
malt
notes
in
the
nosea
little
grain
alcohol
is
detected
grainy
and
bready
on
the
palate
with
some
alcohollike
sweetness
a
leafyherbal
finsih
dryes
it
out
a
little
more
it
seems
bigger
than
what
it
is
ut
its
a
nice
lager
beer
and
it
goes
well
with
some
kassler
and
kraut
overall
this
is
really
one
very
enjoyable
brew
it
has
a
great
flavor
profile
with
a
large
degree
of
complexity
but
yet
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
and
appreciate
this
is
one
i
am
definitely
going
to
seek
out
more
often
o
perhaps
a
tad
too
malty
for
a
pilsner
some
traces
of
booze
can
also
be
found
i
used
to
really
love
this
stuff
so
either
this
beer
has
changed
or
i
have
changed
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
lightamber
color
with
white
foam
that
was
moderate
in
height
and
settled
to
a
thin
layer
but
clung
to
the
glass
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
was
modest
but
with
a
sweet
malt
aroma
and
light
aromatic
hops
the
taste
was
sweet
up
front
followed
by
some
aromatic
noble
hops
flavors
modest
bitterness
as
it
is
overpower
somewhat
by
the
sweet
maltiness
the
flavor
of
alcohol
could
also
be
discerned
the
finish
left
the
taste
of
hops
together
with
some
grainy
malt
the
body
was
medium
to
mediumfull
with
low
overall
carbonation
feel
and
a
sweetness
throughout
hops
lingered
in
the
finish
this
was
not
an
unpleasant
beer
but
unlike
any
german
kellerbier
i
have
had
in
germany
and
too
strong
and
sweet
to
be
a
pils
though
it
could
fit
into
the
imperial
pilsner
category
i
had
this
beer
on
my
wants
list
for
over
5
years
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
to
drink
a
bottle
drinks
thin
and
flat
border
line
lame
compared
to
the
traditional
lagers
of
germany
this
upscaled
and
asserted
version
tramples
the
taste
buds
and
never
apologizes
for
it
its
bold
for
its
own
sake
and
dares
you
to
revel
in
it
its
a
seriously
taste
lager
that
will
find
favor
with
any
fan
of
ipa
just
remember
this
beer
has
european
roots
very
drinkable
flavorful
lager
easy
to
enjoy
would
go
good
with
food
or
on
its
own
would
definitely
have
this
again
an
interesting
enough
beer
but
i
prefer
the
lower
alcohol
more
drinkable
versions
from
the
vaterland
pilzilla
is
very
delicious
its
like
a
pils
on
steroids
and
i
guess
could
be
called
an
imperial
pilsner
i
like
the
smooth
character
and
the
lagered
taste
yet
it
is
much
more
robust
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
good
long
time
and
plenty
of
lacing
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
i
wish
there
were
more
around
like
it
cheers
right
out
of
the
bottle
this
lovely
sticky
little
burnished
gold
brew
is
a
delight
to
see
decent
lacing
ok
head
retention
but
that
might
be
because
the
poor
little
thing
had
to
travel
all
the
way
from
pa
to
chicago
before
i
could
taste
it
the
aromas
were
a
bit
subdued
compared
to
the
taste
which
was
fantastic
cream
feel
on
the
tongue
but
an
explosion
of
flavor
great
work
on
this
one
gentlemen
i
am
sure
glad
i
scored
a
taste
case
back
in
pa
nebulous
peachy
gold
with
only
a
fine
layer
of
white
creaminess
on
top
aromas
are
floral
and
grassy
hay
melon
oranges
spicy
hops
cereal
grain
sweetness
softly
sweet
doughy
flavor
upfront
citrus
honey
and
plenty
of
floral
hops
quickly
balance
the
malt
drying
bitter
and
crisp
which
increases
the
drinkability
despite
the
heavierthanusual
mouthfeel
not
quite
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
but
still
pretty
tasty
and
interesting
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
great
hoppy
beer
that
breaks
out
of
the
ipa
category
o
very
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
nice
pairing
with
spicy
foods
in
my
case
malaysian
i
have
tried
a
previous
years
years
and
like
the
fact
that
it
changes
a
little
bit
subtly
each
year
o
not
quite
within
style
parameters
for
a
pils
but
tasty
nonetheless
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
it
again
should
i
come
across
it
its
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
for
some
reason
i
didnt
expect
a
ton
but
ill
admit
to
ending
up
very
pleased
if
this
were
available
around
here
i
could
see
drinking
it
regularly
tasty
stuff
o
voodoos
pilzilla
is
an
enjoyable
and
hoppy
lager
that
is
a
great
beer
for
hopheads
who
want
a
lager
prosit
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
straw
color
with
one
finger
of
tight
white
head
the
aroma
is
really
nice
i
get
a
very
clean
lager
yeast
and
breadbiscuit
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
array
of
hops
behind
it
the
hops
stray
towards
the
herbal
spicy
spectrum
and
complement
the
clean
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
okay
both
of
the
elements
of
the
aroma
are
still
present
but
i
just
didnt
feel
like
they
integrated
very
well
still
good
just
not
as
integrated
as
i
was
hoping
for
the
mouthfeel
was
good
like
a
good
lager
it
was
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
i
will
give
it
another
shot
next
year
when
they
tweak
the
recipe
again
drink
much
better
than
the
moosacher
version
much
more
alive
and
vibrant
and
polished
sweet
savory
and
rich
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
od
this
beer
was
good
but
the
hop
profile
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
too
much
herbal
and
grassy
quality
its
definitely
a
unique
beer
easily
the
hoppiest
lager
ive
ever
had
pappy
says
so
d
i
could
crush
these
what
a
great
showcase
of
european
hops
in
an
unfitered
lager
o
looking
at
this
beer
and
seeing
it
in
the
same
style
as
surly
hell
im
blown
away
by
this
beer
and
what
the
bounderies
of
this
style
can
be
o
this
is
a
good
lager
with
a
complex
and
interesting
taste
sorry
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
dont
call
your
beer
pilzilla
if
the
beer
isnt
a
pilsner
i
detest
wheat
beers
but
love
pilsners
and
i
have
no
idea
why
one
would
try
to
combine
the
two
styles
its
either
a
wheat
or
a
pilsner
not
both
this
beer
had
the
appearance
of
a
wheat
but
the
body
of
a
pilsner
and
when
you
name
a
beer
pilzilla
it
should
look
and
taste
like
a
pilsner
the
beer
is
basically
a
pale
wheat
just
call
it
what
it
fucking
is
otherwise
pilzilla
has
been
an
amazingly
refreshing
change
of
pace
in
my
everyday
beer
tasting
i
like
that
the
guys
at
voodoo
brewery
arent
afraid
to
mess
around
with
styles
ill
have
to
try
more
of
their
stuff
mouthfeel
wonderful
body
with
great
carbonation
and
just
beautifully
drinkable
well
done
here
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
will
get
it
again
in
the
future
without
a
doubt
will
probably
make
the
rounds
for
upcoming
christmas
gifts
too
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
wouldnt
mind
it
again
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
two
words
try
this
beer
its
so
delicious
o
have
i
mentioned
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
flavorful
too
i
would
drink
this
constantly
if
it
were
available
thanks
again
josh
i
like
the
finish
but
the
middle
of
the
palate
is
too
sweet
for
me
it
did
grow
on
me
a
bit
as
i
got
through
it
but
nothing
exceptional
falls
between
a
sharp
zippy
pilsner
and
an
amber
lager
in
flavor
theres
a
bready
body
with
some
lemony
tones
drinks
like
a
few
double
pilsners
that
ive
had
on
the
less
dry
side
of
that
spectrum
the
pour
creates
a
sculptable
head
and
laces
the
glass
like
crazy
as
you
drink
it
down
heavy
on
the
saaz
hops
alcohol
content
is
very
well
hidden
for
the
strength
anyone
who
likes
the
pale
lager
style
and
wants
some
deeper
richer
toastier
flavors
should
have
a
fine
time
with
this
beer
overall
pretty
good
an
admittedly
narrow
field
in
the
us
this
was
pretty
nice
my
only
significant
critique
is
the
high
carbonation
level
well
beyond
crisp
lager
and
into
the
saisonbier
brut
category
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
great
mix
of
pilsner
malt
with
some
peaches
and
grass
from
the
hops
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
also
very
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
pine
and
grass
notes
from
the
hops
as
well
as
some
biscuit
and
pilsner
malt
there
is
also
a
nice
spice
component
that
really
adds
to
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
do
drinkability
is
decent
i
found
myself
really
enjoying
the
grape
citrus
and
apple
notes
in
this
beer
a
bit
more
than
the
malts
which
are
clearly
overshadowed
the
hops
are
really
a
slam
on
the
palate
and
while
refreshing
at
first
i
found
it
growing
heavy
near
the
end
of
the
glass
a
very
nice
surprise
not
sure
what
to
expect
but
got
more
than
i
hoped
for
good
warm
weather
drinker
too
sweet
and
missing
that
crispness
with
a
creamy
body
that
doesnt
feel
right
in
a
pils
unique
hop
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
but
not
sure
if
i
enjoyed
the
malt
component
split
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
was
better
than
average
just
expected
better
a
full
flavored
pilsner
easy
drinking
but
more
frutiy
flavor
and
thinkness
than
your
normal
pilsner
being
a
big
fan
of
a
crisp
crafty
pils
this
one
jsut
was
above
average
for
me
defintiley
worth
a
try
in
a
6
pack
or
22oz
bottle
o
this
beer
was
super
cold
when
i
poured
it
which
may
have
influenced
the
utter
lack
of
any
discernible
head
otherwise
id
have
to
conclude
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
thing
was
flat
waxy
and
extremely
unlikable
maybe
its
the
style
but
i
cant
believe
this
is
what
the
brewers
intended
an
utter
disappointment
will
revisit
if
given
the
chance
to
determine
what
exactly
in
the
hell
this
was
d
nicely
executed
subtle
and
powerful
both
at
the
same
time
quaffable
loaded
with
character
loaded
with
flavor
loaded
with
complexity
this
one
is
also
a
bargain
to
boot
voodoo
is
a
very
underrated
appreciated
brewery
that
deserves
wider
attention
this
is
very
good
stuff
and
highly
recommended
o
its
good
o
the
aroma
was
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
fell
short
especially
with
the
bitterness
and
aspirin
notes
never
had
this
style
before
so
it
seemed
like
a
good
beer
for
new
beer
sunday
ive
also
never
tried
a
voodoo
beer
here
we
go
i
poured
the
beer
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
big
fluffy
head
with
a
hazy
golden
body
underneath
has
a
bit
of
floral
spicy
scent
hmm
this
is
an
interesting
taste
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
had
kind
of
an
earthy
pungent
grassy
taste
not
sure
what
kind
of
hops
bring
that
to
the
table
theres
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
standard
not
too
thick
slightly
carbonated
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
probably
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
i
might
have
one
every
now
and
then
id
like
to
try
more
of
voodoos
beers
my
first
beer
of
this
rare
style
glad
i
tried
it
not
a
pilsner
for
sure
so
if
you
are
looking
for
that
in
this
beer
forget
it
maybe
it
fits
the
zwickel
category
better
but
its
not
a
keller
or
classic
pils
if
you
ask
me
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
ever
seek
out
i
think
all
of
our
awesome
other
pa
pils
kills
my
taste
buds
for
this
beer
shame
because
i
love
the
dark
voodoo
beers
poured
a
light
yellowhoney
color
mildly
hazy
but
nothing
to
detract
from
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
light
very
slightly
bready
sweet
and
a
peculiar
lemon
drop
bouquet
a
very
hoppy
beer
lots
of
grass
lemon
peel
touch
of
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
an
effervescent
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
quite
delicious
overall
its
really
good
wish
they
had
bottle
dates
so
i
could
buy
it
more
consistently
drinkability
is
good
easy
to
drink
with
no
noticeable
alcohol
and
quite
tasty
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
it
the
lacing
isnt
too
bad
the
smell
is
a
lot
like
a
pilsner
but
its
also
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
too
the
taste
is
hoppy
enough
to
mask
the
grassy
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
carbonated
and
had
a
light
body
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
could
drink
this
one
again
o
ive
always
liked
this
beer
its
dialed
in
for
the
real
hop
heads
in
the
crowd
and
delivers
the
goods
in
a
very
aggressive
manner
for
a
pils
great
job
voodoo
fist
pump
do
drinkability
is
great
and
overall
this
is
a
rich
and
tasty
frankenstein
of
a
pils
lovin
it
beer
is
thin
and
wet
up
front
but
finishes
rather
dry
with
an
odd
bitterness
to
it
it
is
almost
sandy
on
the
finish
gritty
are
these
from
the
hops
it
is
not
an
unenjoyable
beer
it
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
keller
but
there
is
something
about
that
that
makes
it
not
measure
up
in
my
mind
i
think
the
finish
was
just
too
harsh
for
my
tastes
id
have
ti
again
on
draft
out
of
the
bottle
probably
too
it
was
fine
this
was
a
great
beer
of
a
style
i
really
need
to
try
again
welldone
voodoo
im
not
really
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
or
lagers
in
general
but
i
definatly
have
respect
for
this
one
has
a
very
nice
hoppy
bite
too
it
definatly
try
this
if
you
can
find
it
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
pilsner
urquell
imho
a
very
hazy
beer
for
a
pils
nice
goldorangey
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
fades
quickly
lots
of
bready
and
lager
yeast
smells
backed
up
by
a
good
hop
profile
mild
sweetness
from
pils
malt
upfront
definitely
taste
the
variety
of
hops
used
and
finishes
with
some
nice
spiciness
feels
a
little
thin
for
what
i
was
expecting
an
enjoyable
drink
not
a
classic
pilsner
but
they
are
trying
to
be
enjoy
o
really
liked
this
one
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
tasted
very
fresh
my
first
sampling
of
this
style
and
it
came
off
kind
of
like
a
hoppy
pilsner
sort
of
similar
to
dfh
my
antonia
but
certainly
not
as
hoppy
pours
a
slightly
murky
gold
visible
carbonation
and
a
medium
sized
persistent
head
smell
is
somewhat
unique
very
floral
sweet
and
mellow
taste
is
immediately
bitter
hops
herbal
hop
finish
a
very
subtle
cakey
sweetness
rounds
it
out
although
its
really
just
a
background
note
to
the
hops
still
it
adds
a
really
nice
unique
note
to
this
beer
that
i
really
like
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
very
easily
drinkable
i
really
love
a
good
pils
or
keller
bier
and
ive
enjoyed
some
other
american
takes
on
some
of
these
german
styles
like
victorys
prima
pils
this
is
perhaps
the
best
example
of
this
really
great
stuffl
overall
this
is
a
great
enjoyable
beer
and
one
to
have
again
some
day
for
sure
my
first
for
this
style
and
this
is
a
winner
right
here
very
tolerable
alcohol
level
and
hardly
noticeable
before
i
knew
how
much
i
was
enjoying
it
i
wanted
more
and
it
was
all
gone
she
went
fast
delicious
the
cpj
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
because
it
lacked
many
of
the
classic
qualities
of
a
czech
pisener
too
much
biscuit
malt
and
hops
ruined
the
style
a
royal
smack
in
the
face
to
the
true
czech
pilsner
style
d
very
solid
and
much
better
on
tap
versus
the
bottle
i
reviewed
some
time
ago
on
tap
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
with
pilsners
pilzilla
is
nice
and
hoppy
d
as
i
mentioned
i
thought
the
flavors
were
really
well
balanced
i
was
expecting
pilsner
flavors
here
which
i
got
with
a
little
more
hops
added
this
one
was
easy
to
drink
a
3
75
s
3
75
m
4
t
4
o4
pours
an
electic
hazy
yellow
with
a
slight
off
white
head
which
gives
way
to
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
notes
with
some
lemon
and
citrus
and
a
touch
of
breadiness
the
taste
is
of
grass
and
floral
hops
with
a
slight
hint
of
sweetness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
balance
and
a
some
and
easy
drink
the
taste
has
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
interested
d
really
nice
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
enjoyable
its
my
first
kellerzwickel
bier
very
tasty
though
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
finishes
quite
crisp
with
the
hops
lasting
inside
the
mouth
in
both
flavor
and
bitterness
i
for
one
am
not
familiar
with
other
examples
of
the
keller
bier
zwickel
bier
style
but
i
approached
this
as
if
it
was
going
to
be
a
pilsner
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
shares
some
similarities
to
a
pilsner
only
it
is
much
more
hearty
in
all
aspects
it
has
been
too
long
since
i
last
had
this
brew
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
was
pretty
decent
i
liked
the
fruity
and
bitter
hoppiness
it
brought
pretty
nice
beer
overall
and
went
down
pretty
easy
this
evening
d
this
is
a
great
lager
to
drink
a
little
more
hop
character
than
expected
but
it
certainly
does
not
take
away
from
the
beer
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
again
and
again
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
better
hopmalt
balance
would
enhance
this
one
quite
a
bit
a
bit
too
bitter
for
what
would
otherwise
be
a
great
summer
beer
im
enjoying
but
i
think
one
bottle
is
enough
in
a
sitting
and
time
to
try
something
else
very
drinkable
great
flavor
just
enough
hop
bitterness
and
aroma
with
great
pilsner
malt
flavors
d
not
that
strong
pretty
decent
taste
would
try
again
and
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
of
these
murky
dark
yellow
in
color
with
a
strong
foamy
light
head
lots
of
thick
sticky
lacings
the
light
malt
aroma
is
trumped
by
the
dominant
hop
aromas
lemon
and
grass
theres
a
hint
of
yeast
aroma
that
sneaks
through
after
a
few
sips
medium
to
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
malty
flavor
in
the
beginning
that
leads
to
lemon
citrus
hop
flavors
a
hint
of
yeast
and
pine
hop
finish
a
very
unique
lager
that
went
down
very
smoothly
and
easily
glad
i
bought
more
than
one
pours
a
cloudy
slightlydarkened
yellow
that
is
very
hazy
a
nice
lofty
white
head
forms
and
sits
for
quite
some
time
nice
and
thick
with
good
sticky
lace
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
light
citrus
notes
along
with
light
sweet
grain
the
taste
brings
some
noble
hops
with
a
bit
of
flowers
in
addition
to
some
light
fruit
grain
and
dough
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thin
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
really
good
american
rendition
on
an
underutilized
style

d
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
there
isnt
a
damn
thing
wrong
with
it
and
so
much
right
goes
down
super
easy
as
well
this
is
only
my
second
voodoo
beer
bbvd
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
and
i
have
no
idea
why
it
took
so
long
to
get
to
this
second
beer
if
im
not
stupid
i
need
to
try
to
whole
lineup
asap
pilzilla
lager
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
and
hoppy
lagers
i
have
consumed
the
9
varieties
of
german
czech
and
polish
hops
should
say
it
all
nice
job
voodoo
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
brew
is
light
gold
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
zesty
lemon
and
wet
hay
on
the
nose
thfe
flavor
is
light
grassy
and
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
the
finish
lingers
for
a
bit
nice
light
body
and
well
carbonated
a
smooth
easy
drinker
i
liked
it
imo
it
taste
like
and
imperial
pilsner
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
coasters
on
top
good
lace
already
smells
clean
and
crisp
with
that
very
distinct
czech
style
aroma
some
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
as
well
with
a
slightly
sweet
start
with
hops
that
then
kick
in
pine
type
bitterness
that
isnt
too
harsh
pretty
decent
for
a
lager
lightmedium
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
decent
but
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
an
odd
flavor
to
it
not
as
clean
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
decent
drinkability
d
im
not
sure
how
fresh
this
bottle
was
but
it
was
quite
good
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
perfect
levels
of
carbonation
and
bitterness
cheers
d
this
is
like
a
german
style
ipa
but
lagered
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
good
but
not
great
overall
i
expected
more
maybe
its
not
too
fresh
dwell
balanced
and
hopped
up
pilzner
it
has
a
strong
yeast
presence
with
great
hop
profile
and
a
soft
creamy
feel
well
done
beer
long
live
american
craft
brewers
raw
flavorful
and
a
little
complex
yet
very
drinkable
this
is
proof
that
more
brewers
need
to
bring
a
hoppy
lager
to
the
table
d
i
like
it
i
wish
we
had
this
one
here
tasted
from
12oz
bottle
obtained
in
a
trade
pours
cloudy
bright
orange
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
minimal
lace
nose
of
light
hops
with
some
citrus
yeast
and
cereal
malt
there
is
more
hops
citrus
and
bitterness
than
i
had
expected
along
with
the
same
cerealbread
malt
and
some
yeastiness
as
well
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
average
carbonation
and
a
medium
finish
that
features
citrus
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
a
little
out
of
balance
but
this
beer
is
still
very
drinkable
d
i
am
a
bit
let
down
it
sounder
better
than
it
was
this
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
one
but
i
will
keep
a
lot
of
these
stocked
drinkability
an
odd
beer
but
one
i
found
rather
enjoyable
g311
sent
me
a
bottle
of
this
thanks
vince
this
smells
and
tastes
nicer
than
lightly
soapy
on
the
nose
but
still
intensely
german
hop
character
not
really
a
deep
pilsner
malt
nose
but
with
some
dough
opening
with
plenty
of
hop
flavor
and
a
pleasant
bitterness
this
is
a
bastardized
pilsner
thats
actually
rather
enjoyable
a
lot
drier
than
the
12oz
bottle
i
last
had
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
also
great
im
really
digging
this
im
upping
the
m
score
by
0
5
great
looking
webbed
lacing
finishes
bitter
and
clean
very
nice
this
is
just
an
allaround
fantastically
drinkable
beer
if
i
had
it
available
to
me
it
would
be
my
yearround
session
beer
for
sure
even
though
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
i
would
like
for
that
purpose
highly
recommended
edit
the
pepper
subsided
after
a
bit
leaving
a
decent
bready
character
decent
but
not
great
enough
to
bump
the
overall
taste
up
substantially
moved
from
2
0
to
2
5
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
excellant
retention
patches
of
merange
type
lacing
quite
a
bit
of
european
hops
in
the
aroma
it
smells
spicy
floral
and
earthy
a
little
crackerlike
malt
as
well
the
hops
give
more
of
a
bitter
quality
than
adding
much
of
a
flavor
component
dry
qualities
from
the
malt
with
some
lemon
and
pepper
in
the
finish
it
has
good
flavor
just
wish
a
little
more
hop
flavor
from
the
50
ibus
with
the
7
abv
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
barely
detectable
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
nice
carbonation
good
lager
qualities
a
different
take
on
an
european
lager
that
is
very
good
would
definately
like
to
try
this
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spritzy
crisp
and
dry
moreys
bottom
line
well
im
an
ale
guy
that
being
said
this
is
a
well
crafted
lager
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
from
time
to
time
especially
in
the
warmer
months
the
only
down
side
is
the
price
tag
d
defiantly
better
than
my
last
review
of
tire
bite
this
has
renewed
my
faith
from
the
hate
from
bmc
on
my
tbuds
that
pilsners
are
a
watery
bitter
mess
pours
a
golden
pale
orange
color
with
tons
of
pinpoint
sized
active
bubbles
which
leave
a
big
head
that
lasts
pretty
long
smell
is
of
earthy
freshly
dried
grains
hay
grass
faint
roasted
nuts
with
touches
of
citrusy
lemon
and
earthy
hops
taste
follows
scent
very
nice
fresh
taste
to
this
beer
definitely
not
bold
or
clean
just
good
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
despite
all
of
the
crazy
little
bubbles
a
nice
beer
good
alternative
for
bmc
drinkers
and
those
likeing
a
cleaner
fresher
tasting
brew
as
well
as
those
who
appreciate
a
finely
crafted
beer
pour
is
nearly
clear
but
with
a
tinge
of
cloudiness
color
is
close
to
yellow
but
maybe
a
little
orange
in
there
puffy
head
recedes
quickly
but
leaves
a
happy
trail
down
the
glass
zesty
grassy
aroma
and
taste
finish
is
not
as
clean
as
i
would
expect
and
it
comes
across
a
little
hot
although
the
abv
is
only
6
7
i
might
put
this
in
the
imperial
pilsner
category
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
d
damn
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
this
and
the
4
seasons
rocked
me
traders
note
many
thanks
to
msulinski
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
fine
elixir
overall
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
at
all
maybe
ill
give
it
another
chance
in
the
future
and
update
this
review
if
my
impressions
change
again
voodoo
offers
another
interesting
take
on
a
style
i
appreciate
the
uniqueness
and
look
forward
to
many
good
things
coming
out
of
this
somewhat
local
brewery
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
drinkability
lightmedium
body
no
hint
of
the
7
abv
not
overly
spicy
either
certainly
an
interesting
brew
worth
trying
each
year
as
the
recipe
is
always
changing
d
by
far
the
best
big
pils
ive
tried
though
i
havent
tried
many
it
manages
to
maintain
its
pilsner
roots
while
becoming
something
bigger
and
all
together
different
really
appreciating
this
beer
d
decent
drinkability
with
fairly
good
regards
here
but
wouldnt
go
to
far
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
dry
grassy
but
lacks
crispness
and
the
spicy
saaz
hops
which
get
muddled
in
with
the
other
8
varieties
overall
this
beer
is
probably
worth
checking
out
but
doesnt
do
much
for
defining
the
style
much
more
suited
for
6
packs
and
sharing
with
friends
then
a
single
bomber
not
a
bad
beer
to
kick
back
with
for
a
summer
quencher
that
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
wheat
in
my
opinion
pours
a
very
nice
semicloudy
golden
straw
color
with
fantastic
head
and
lacing
very
nice
scent
sweet
and
malty
without
being
cloying
with
a
nice
butterscotchbubblegum
aroma
and
slight
spice
in
the
nose
fantastic
taste
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
great
nearwheat
semibutterscotchbubblegum
flavor
tiny
bit
of
spice
and
a
nice
pelt
of
hops
at
the
end
to
make
it
wonderfully
balanced
extremely
smooth
a
wonderful
beer
a
nice
beer
to
toast
the
impending
end
of
summer
perhaps
i
was
thrown
by
the
name
and
expecting
more
but
what
i
find
is
a
hoppy
lager
that
clocks
in
at
around
70
ibus
and
7
abv
without
much
pedigree
its
ok
but
refinement
and
focus
are
needed
na
zdravje
i
am
not
sure
of
the
age
of
this
but
i
got
it
in
november
of
2008
but
it
is
still
drinking
quite
nicely
the
hop
character
is
still
quite
vibrant
and
there
is
a
nice
malt
character
that
is
just
noticeable
so
that
this
beer
achieves
some
balance
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
beer
is
close
to
peaking
though
i
wouldnt
necessarily
guess
that
a
pils
type
beer
should
be
drink
any
way
except
as
fresh
as
possible
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
quite
enjoyable
too
big
for
a
keller
too
confused
for
an
imperial
pils
needs
a
little
tinkering
but
not
without
hope
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
not
bad
on
tap
a
capones
this
one
comes
out
with
an
ample
white
head
lacing
ok
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
color
is
on
the
yellow
orange
side
when
you
bring
this
to
the
nose
you
will
smell
hops
and
a
lot
many
different
hop
smells
from
grapefruit
to
grassy
pine
the
taste
is
hoppy
at
first
and
then
seems
to
calm
down
some
had
a
hard
time
tasting
the
grains
this
is
a
hopped
up
pils
to
say
the
least
good
mouth
feel
except
for
the
slight
over
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
would
limit
myself
to
one
at
a
time
later
excellently
drinkable
with
a
manageable
abv
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
the
flavors
really
do
not
get
old
and
offer
refreshing
bursts
of
flavor
with
every
sip
i
finally
review
this
great
brew
after
a
few
conversations
with
the
brewer
a
big
pil
with
grassy
grainy
notes
so
floral
smell
crisp
clean
easy
too
drink
with
the
taste
of
corn
about
an
inch
of
lace
and
foam
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
absolutely
a
favorite
this
is
a
great
brew
i
wish
i
had
a
pizza
to
go
along
with
it
but
ill
settle
for
a
nice
sunny
day
instead
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
already
wish
i
had
another
voodoo
has
done
it
again
another
fine
beer
in
my
book
hazy
straw
color
w
a
nice
white
head
that
held
well
and
left
good
lace
if
no
one
told
me
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
keller
beer
but
i
can
definitely
see
it
nose
and
taste
were
very
well
balanced
mix
of
grassy
herbal
hops
and
a
sweetish
bready
maltiness
i
swear
i
was
even
getting
something
like
grass
flavored
bubblegum
nice
creamy
medium
body
with
a
long
finish
supremely
drinkable
and
a
lovely
early
summer
evening
beer
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
the
head
lasts
well
and
laces
nicely
has
a
nice
aroma
of
grain
earthy
bread
and
some
floral
has
a
high
carbonation
the
flavor
is
sweet
but
kind
of
grainy
not
bad
but
a
touch
differnt
has
a
dry
texture
a
light
medium
body
the
finish
is
good
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
well
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
obtained
in
trade
with
scott
holland
many
thanks
d
as
i
said
i
ordered
more
after
having
it
for
the
first
time
i
always
passed
this
up
when
browsing
the
beer
store
isles
but
thats
not
the
case
no
more
pilzilla
is
officially
on
my
radar
this
truely
exceeded
my
expectations
overall
an
interesting
and
tasty
go
forward
unfiltered
lager
voodoo
for
me
has
been
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
with
a
couple
of
excellent
beers
a
couple
of
swings
missed
like
dave
kingman
at
a
charlie
hough
knuckler
this
is
one
of
the
latter
unfortunately
too
many
moving
parts
to
this
one
that
arent
just
average
but
actively
disagreeable
perfect
carbonation
medium
body
and
the
alcohol
so
well
masked
in
every
aspect
a
truly
remarkable
beer
that
i
would
drink
weekly
if
only
it
was
available
a
great
offering
from
voodoo
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
their
others
and
yet
another
big
thanks
to
aaron
for
making
this
possible
cheers
drinkability
a
nice
beer
that
was
quite
quaffable
big
flavor
will
keep
you
interested
for
a
while
prosit
drinkability
cut
down
a
tad
on
the
carbonation
and
this
brew
would
be
outstanding
as
it
is
it
is
not
too
shabby
at
all
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
and
clear
amber
with
a
1
fingered
head
high
carbonation
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
of
malt
and
piney
hops
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
and
for
a
hop
head
like
myself
the
hop
presence
is
very
nice
big
pine
hop
after
taste
balance
with
a
really
nice
malt
base
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
the
carbonationk
level
seems
a
little
high
the
only
thing
that
holds
this
beer
back
on
drinkablility
is
the
carbonation
overall
a
good
brew
worth
a
try
recommended
22

thanks
for
this
interesting
brew
sara
drank
yesterday
afternoon
poured
into
a
slender
mug
color
is
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
and
has
lots
of
light
brown
flakes
in
it
that
look
like
somebody
sprinkled
cinnamon
in
my
beer
huge
two
inch
soapy
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
consists
of
european
hops
that
are
pretty
floral
lemon
juice
lots
of
yeast
that
is
typical
of
a
lager
toasted
bread
and
earthiness
flavor
starts
of
dry
with
hops
that
have
a
little
citrus
zestiness
to
them
middle
is
bready
malt
and
a
little
sweetness
finish
is
very
bitter
with
hops
and
yeast
both
floral
and
citrusy
later
on
when
it
warms
and
some
of
the
dry
bitterness
mellows
a
bit
bitter
beer
lovers
will
enjoy
this
one
dry
bitter
and
toasty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
a
long
time
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
goes
down
easy
and
is
smooth
regardless
of
how
dry
it
is
first
beer
from
voodoo
and
my
first
keller
bier
both
were
good
introductions
not
much
to
go
off
on
the
style
but
it
is
similar
to
imperial
pilsners
i
have
in
the
passed
along
with
heavily
hopped
lagers
would
drink
this
again
look
forward
to
seeing
when
they
stop
adding
a
different
hop
variety
and
bump
up
the
alcohol
content
because
they
do
both
every
single
year
this
stuff
is
released
after
awhile
it
is
going
to
be
a
beast
of
a
beer
in
both
strength
and
bitterness
recommended
d
drinkability
is
good
the
pilzilla
doesnt
really
have
any
faults
that
can
easily
be
pointed
out
all
categories
come
together
to
make
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
i
could
stick
with
this
beer
for
a
session
and
be
totally
content
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
out
pilzilla
is
excellent
beer
this
is
my
first
beer
from
voodoo
and
im
extremely
impressed
im
anxious
to
try
out
more
of
their
releases
this
is
also
my
first
experience
with
the
style
so
i
dont
really
have
much
to
go
on
for
comparison
but
i
dont
have
any
big
complaints
about
this
one
its
allaround
very
very
impressive
highly
recommended
notes
such
a
treat
to
try
this
beer
from
true
artisans
matt
and
co
at
voodoo
drinkability
is
good
not
sure
if
i
could
put
this
down
as
a
session
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
chunky
white
head
that
leaves
amazing
lacing
and
completely
covers
the
top
for
most
of
the
tasting
the
smell
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
hop
bitterness
bready
and
doughy
malt
and
a
spice
and
lemon
that
almost
hints
of
mint
the
taste
is
very
spicy
upfront
with
a
biscuit
malt
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
this
is
my
first
time
with
this
style
and
i
love
it
obscure
german
beers
tend
to
be
my
favorite
the
mint
hits
the
back
of
the
throat
after
a
nice
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
there
is
a
lot
of
body
to
this
beer
voodoo
makes
some
good
beer
and
i
think
this
is
now
my
favorite
from
them
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
long
and
i
will
be
looking
for
it
on
tap
while
i
am
out
i
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
pretty
straight
up
noble
hops
there
is
a
great
grassy
aroma
with
just
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
grass
lemon
zest
and
just
a
bit
sulfur
straight
forward
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
masterfully
blended
everything
that
goes
into
it
fits
perfectly
together
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
just
a
bit
more
but
thats
really
just
a
little
complaint
this
is
a
masterful
lager
i
would
love
to
have
access
to
this
on
a
daily
basis
great
beer
d
this
is
really
interesting
and
different
beer
though
i
would
say
its
not
very
well
balanced
just
an
explosion
of
flavors
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
too
many
of
them
at
a
time
either
other
than
that
its
definitely
interesting
like
i
said
there
arent
too
many
pilsners
as
hoppy
as
this
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
recommend
trying
it
besides
a
fairly
fetching
name
it
has
a
wealth
of
pilsener
flavor
that
pushes
a
bit
and
impresses
nicely
for
the
effort
yet
you
never
lose
track
of
its
identity
the
notably
crisp
nature
and
selfcleaning
utility
make
it
a
joy
and
a
breeze
to
drink
its
fun
its
brassy
and
its
a
donedeal
definite
doover
theres
an
interesting
combo
of
pils
flavors
staying
on
the
hoppy
side
of
things
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
and
a
very
nice
one
at
that
opened
the
bomber
and
foam
started
erupting
gently
out
of
the
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
smelled
grassy
and
of
lemon
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
was
awesome
it
was
peppery
and
refreshing
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
the
way
the
beer
opened
i
thought
the
beer
was
going
to
be
overly
carbonated
it
wasnt
at
all
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
will
be
enjoying
again
and
again
once
splashed
on
my
tongue
a
lot
of
alcohol
and
some
grains
are
immediately
noticeable
and
overpowering
enough
to
provide
a
very
off
taste
that
corroborates
well
with
the
smell
but
poorly
on
the
taste
buds
really
bitter
and
tart
and
not
really
for
me
d
really
different
beer
totally
enjoyable
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
drinkability
it
was
truly
a
unique
beer
experience
how
could
it
not
with
this
beers
high
level
of
grassy
hops
i
enjoyed
voodoos
interpretation
of
the
keller
bier
style
would
i
ever
buy
it
again
i
would
if
i
was
even
in
the
mood
for
some
grassy
hops
if
you
want
to
try
an
americanized
hopped
up
keller
bier
then
give
pilzilla
a
whirl

it
really
needs

to
this
beer
damn
good
overall
pilsner
fans
meet
goliath
above
average
drinkable
beer
i
picked
up
a
bomber
for
5
99
at
champanes
in
warren
the
beer
was
pale
yellow
hazy
with
a
thick
rocky
foam
the
smell
was
all
hops
very
pilsneresque
a
little
grass
or
musk
mixed
in
similar
to
urquell
the
taste
was
mostly
slightly
bitter
hops
but
with
malt
sweetness
to
counterbalance
there
was
a
slightly
biting
aftertaste
like
from
pepper
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thick
side
for
a
pils
and
the
flavor
kept
me
going
at
it
until
the
bomber
was
gone
drinkability
is
definitely
harmed
by
the
high
carbonation
but
gets
better
once
its
been
given
a
little
time
to
settle
the
bitterness
also
feels
like
a
bit
much
by
half
way
through
the
glass
the
carbonation
has
settled
a
little
and
im
growing
a
little
numb
to
the
bitterness
so
it
gets
better
rough
around
the
edges
up
front
but
mellows
out
a
little
pours
a
clear
light
golden
colour
touch
of
amber

jason
d
not
overtly
complicated
but
easy
and
nice
i
would
do
this
for
a
session
easy
pours
cloudly

thick

lots

there
as
well
very
complex
alcohol
is
also
noticable
but
is
inoffencive
smooth
and
somewhat
thick
good
carbonation
it
is
drinkable
but
i
found
it
pretty
filling
so
id
do
no
more
than
couple
of
those
at
the
time
and
start
over
next
day
it
is
delicious
brew
definately
recommended
pours

leaves

the
taste

this
is
a
very
nice
brew
different
recommended
ps
i
appreciate
the
warning
about
the
carbonation
scott
no
spills
and
thanks
again
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
notes
i
cant
help
but
rate
this
as
a
good
brew
its
nothing
super
standout
but
its
definitely
not
gross
for
a
big
lager
this
hits
the
spot
after
hearing
so
much
about
voodoo
im
glad
i
was
able
to
go
to
the
beer
store
and
grab
this
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
a
style
that
i
am
all
to
familar
withbut
i
would
nescribe
this
as
a
more
complex
pilsner
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
id
have
no
objection
to
drinking
this
beer
again
good
session
beer
that
would
probably
also
be
a
great
candidate
for
a
hoppy
pils
fan
with
a
kegerator
md
mouthfeel
was
good
it
was
really
smooth
and
slid
down
the
palate
however
the
taste
just
killed
the
drinkability
component
for
me
a
menagerie
of
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
a
cascading
tour
of
european
hop
fields
in
the
background
is
a
soft
bready
malt
presence
the
oily
hop
bitterness
here
is
impressive
even
for
a
modernday
pils
but
it
doesnt
distract
from
the
drinkability
of
this
one
bit
a
big
agressive
pils
for
sure
but
i
like
the
direction
this
brew
is
headed
ive
had
enough
extreme
stouts
and
ipas
more
imperial
browns
imperial
pils
imperial
macros
ok
i
may
have
gone
a
bit
too
far
that
being
said
this
is
a
damn
fine
creation
from
voodoo
brewing
overall
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
one
for
sure
it
was
much
more
balanced
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
that
was
awesome
smooth
and
rich
this
was
a
very
nice
pale
ale
or
at
least
i
think
thats
what
it
is
it
kind
of
straddled
styles
more
or
less
still
though
very
solid
and
i
could
see
myself
in
this
one
again
cloudy
yellow
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
great
head
retention
with
lots
of
chunky
lace
crackery
malt
aroma
maybe
a
bit
of
toasted
bread
with
lots
of
hop
character
lemony
grassy
spicy
just
a
hint
of
sulfur
really
fragrant
and
smells
great
strong
bitterness
that
wasnt
harsh
but
was
also
reigned
in
by
some
sweetness
midpalate
notes
of
bread
and
crackers
were
light
compared
to
the
intense
hop
flavour
lots
of
lemon
and
freshly
cut
grass
a
bit
spicier
towards
the
end
hoppy
bitterness
lingered
the
ample
carbonation
gave
it
a
fullness
of
body
that
wouldnt
have
been
there
otherwise
though
the
beer
itself
was
not
thin
by
any
means
the
texture
remained
creamy
throughout
this
stuff
tastes
great
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
im
glad
it
came
in
a
bomber
because
12oz
would
have
left
me

a
nice

and
a
decent

md
medium
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
and
crisp
this
was
a
smooth
clean
refreshing
and
rather
easydrinking
brew
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hoppy
or
imperial
pilsners
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
beer
as
well
d
not
bad
if
you
like
lots
o
hops
in
your
pils
that
being
said
i
am
sort
of
tired
of
pouring
these
fizzy
nightmares
about
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
if
you
ask
me
i
could
go
for
a
keg
of
this
stuff
its
damn
tasty
stuff
a
permanent
add
to
my
wants
list
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
small
craft
warning
uber
pils
by
clipper
city
in
baltimore
and
old
domininions
spring
brew
for
those
hop
head
ale
drinkers
who
dont
like
most
lagers
give
this
one
a
try
it
may
suprise
you
notes
got
this
one
from
darkerthebetter
as
an
extra
thanks
a
ton
very
interesting
stuff
here
unique
and
wellcrafted
its
good
to
see
american
breweries
experimenting
with
these
obscure
styles
this
is
one
hoppy
ass
lager
and
i
love
it
this
is
hoppy
in
the
realm
of
imperial
pilsners
its
also
a
damn
good
beer
a
must
try
this
is
like
taking
pilsner
urquell
and
turning
the
volume
up
to
11
get
this
beer
if
you
love
a
good
pilsner
taste
is
pretty
bitter
lots
of
hop
flavorlike
a
big
pils
on
steroids
the
mouthfeel
was
light
dry
and
thin
but
the
carbonation
was
too
much
if
they
had
cut
down
the
carbonation
by
about
a
third
i
think
this
would
have
been
amazing
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
huge
hop
character
and
the
way
over
the
top
carbonation
very
good
and
if
you
happen
to
see
it
definately
pick
it
up
recommended
t
despite
ridiculous
carbonation
i
let
this
sit
for
a
while
and
mouthfeel
is
remarkably
smooth
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
but
very
pleasant
starts
off
slightly
bitter
but
by
finish
is
surprisingly
mildly
sweet
very
earthy
citrus
lemon
pepper
herb
floral
taste
in
body
great
malt
backbone
to
this
overall
exceptionally
drinkable
and
am
happy
i
know
have
easy
access
to
voodoo
beers
this
voodoo
company
brew
is
probably
best
thought
of
as
a
double
pilsner
despite
what
the
brewery
claims
having
said
that
they
do
refer
to
it
as
a
pilsner
on
their
website
and
they
obviously
chose
the
name
for
a
reason
in
any
case
pilzilla
is
outstanding
beer
that
would
no
doubt
cause
the
same
panicked
stampede
among
bud
drinkers
as
godzilla
caused
in
tokyo
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
except
for
two
things
it
would
take
forever
to
wait
for
the
foam
to
go
away
and
it
is
8
bucks
a
bottle
my
second
kellerzwickel
beer
and
its
a
good
one
very
easy
drinking
somewhat
complex
and
unique
as
far
as
lagers
go
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
price
which
at
8
is
a
bit
high
for
a
good
nearly
sessionable
beer
worth
seeking
a
bottle
out
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
pilsner
that
aleobsessed
hopheads
will
love
as
much
as
pilsner
fans
i
had
it
in
a
22
oz
bottle
it
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
golden
with
a
light
lacy
head
it
has
that
delicious
crisp
lagery
aroma
but
it
has
a
surprisingly
meaty
mouthfeel
and
an
unexpected
hop
bite
not
a
lot
of
hop
aroma
but
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
back
end
its
crisp
with
a
good
light
refreshing
taste
of
grain
which
will
please
the
pilsner
fan
but
a
sneaky
tingle
on
the
back
edges
of
the
tongue
that
will
please
the
hophead
unexpected
and
delicious
all
around
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
beer
again
and
seeing
of
i
can
come
even
close
to
replicating
it
in
my
home
brew
tanks
simple
yet
effective
get
this
and
your
vitamins
holy
head
batman
pours
a
slightly
hazed
gold
with
a
massive
creme
head
nose
is
clean
and
mild
flavor
is
heavier
on
dough
than
anything
with
a
decent
earthy
edge
and
too
noticeable
a
sweet
tone
on
the
start
feel
is
typical
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
certainly
overcarbonated
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
i
would
expect
but
its
nice
enough
drinkability
is
good
an
interesting
beer
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
strong
pilsner
i
like
it
and
will
enjoy
this
bomber
a
lot
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
paid
way
too
much
money
for
this
bottle
but
with
that
said
will
someone
else
buy
me
another
pours
a
foggy
bronze
with
a
huge
fluffy
two

white
head
that
never
seems
to
die
down
stickiness
is
a
thick
layer
that
stays
forever
lots
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
a
spicey
yeast
aroma
with
a
nice
blend
of
noble
hops
pepper
and
lemongrass
tickle
the
nose
as
well
some
buttery
biscuit
scents
make
an
appearance
too
very
complex
smell
fresh
and
clean
floral
hops
up
front
with
an
underlying
yeast
flavor
a
white
bread
like
taste
as
well
as
some
citric
hop
flow
over
the
tongue
a
honey
sweetness
emerges
as
well
as
a
bit
of
malt
which
helps
balance
this
monster
quite
well
aftertaste
is
spicey
noble
hops
very
enjoyable
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
strong
carbonation
that
leaves
a
dry
feeling
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
beer
like
this
before
i
had
new
glarus
yokel
but
pilzilla
has
way
more
flavor
definitely
seek
this
one
out
pours
a
very
light
yellow
and
slightly
watery
looking
at
first
but
then
some
of
the
sediment
falls
in
and
makes
it
look
cool
and
exciting
patchy
white
head
not
very
godzillalike
but
a
lot
like
a
pils
odor
is
soft
of
light
malfs
and
lightly
spiced
hops
some
sweetness
on
the
nose
as
well
but
not
detectable
alcohol
ooh
but
the
taste
is
great
i
was
expecting
a
massive
overhopped
high
alcohol
mess
of
a
lager
one
of
those
americans
are
awesome
because
they
can
make
beer
styles
crazy
type
of
beers
but
this
is
not
really
that
at
all
here
you
have
a
fantastically
crafted
and
tremendously
tasty
spin
on
your
classic
european
pils
sure
is
slightly
hoppier
and
slightly
higher
in
alcohol
than
your
average
pilsner
but
thats
what
it
claims
to
be
what
its
not
is
over
the
top
and
i
like
it
nicely
spiced
malt
backbone
melds
supremely
well
with
the
hops
creamy
quality
and
somewhat
lemony
hops
linger
but
not
harshly
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
and
and
extremely
pleasant
surprize
very
refreshing
in
the
mouth
with
an
aftertaste
of
just
a
bit
of
white
pepper
to
go
with
the
citrus
peel
hop
drinkability
easily
would
have
enjoyed
a
second
22

easily
would
have
enjoyed
buying
a

pack
easily
would
have
enjoyed
paying
less
but
certainly
worth

releasing
a

pours

a

incredibly
easy

fantastic
stuff
though
its
better
from
a
fresh
cask
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
though
i
found
the
metallic
aftertaste
to
be
a
bit
much
throughout
this
is
the
beer
i
was
most
looking
forward
to
and
it
didnt
disappoint
d
surprisingly
enjoyable
this
beer
looked
a
bit
older
and
ick
by
the
bottle
but
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
this
is
a
powerful
and
fresh
tasting
beer
that
is
very
delicious
the
taste
is
similar
but
lightly
on
the
bitter
side
with
bread
hay
pine
lemon
juice
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
and
overall
very
tasty
with
good

quite
a
tasty
beer
and
super
drinkable

one

out

d
an
interesting
tasty
beer
that
just
showed
up
at
bevmo
one
day
dont
see
many
of
this
rare
franconian
style
so
i
had
to
pick
it
up
very
drinkable

try
this

it
shows
up

o
medium
drinkability
standard
swissgerman
lager
style
not
an
altbier
but
much
more
a
keller
beer
i
suggest
trying
the
dunkel
instead
which
i
found
to
be
a
better
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
beer
then
this
might
be
your
cup
o
beer
this
is
also
a
lighter
beer
atleast
bodyfeel
wise
but
it
is
very
refreshing
for
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
that
below
average
brew
at
least
eichhof
is
doing
better
with
other
beers
this
is
a
smooth
and
bready
lager
seriously
it
tastes
like
a
decent
loaf
of
white
bread
but
comes
off
more
like
an
american
lager
this
is
probably
due
to
the
use
of
corn
which
steers
the
malt
character
toward
budweiser
territory
the
complete
lack
of
hops
doesnt
help
but
theres
nothing
offensive
here
it
just
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
good
alt
i
had
my
fair
share
of
this
beer
while
i
was
studying
abroad
this
summer
in
engelberg
switzerland
many
nights
during
the
week
my
fellow
classmates
and
i
would
race
to
get
to
the
bar
to
grab
a
couple
pitchers
of
this
bier
before
happy
hour
was
over
this
beer
made
some
of
the
best
memories
i
had
on
the
trip
filled
with
jokes
laughs
and
drunken
debauchery
this
beer
is
classified
as
an
altbier
but
i
have
to
disagree
with
that
i
would
consider
it
more
of
a
kellerbier
if
anything
it
pours
a
cloudy
tannish
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
laces
somewhat
has
that
clean
smell
associated
with
lagers
not
too
exciting
tastes
slightly
fruity
and
is
alright
to
drink
although
i
did
drink
a
lot
of
it
that
doesnt
mean
i
really
wanted
to
there
wasnt
anything
else
beer
wise
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
search
out
desperately
to
find
had
this
from
a
bottle
at
a
restaurant
in
lucern
switzerland
the
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
good
smell
a
little
fruity
as
is
the
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
orange
rind
i
prefer
the
braugold
or
eichhof
lager
to
this
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
altbier
or
witbier
you
may
like
this
a
nice
beer
in
the
unfiltered
zwickel
style
lager
a
golden
beer
with
white
head
a
light
creamy
texture
with
a
good
malt
base
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
to
balance
a
refreshing
daytime
brew
id
go
with
this
vs
a
filtered
lager
if
given
a
choice
the
yeast
gives
it
a
hint
of
breadiness
in
the
body
but
no
the
smell
and
taste
bring
you
down
to
the
conclusion
that
this
seems
just
to
be
a
dirty
macro
and
by
looking
at
most
of
the
ingredients
the
judgement
should
be
that
one
because
its
taste
is
nothing
but
that
of
a
crappy
macrolike
experience
boo
the
big
swiss
breweries
do
not
produce
many
good
products
this
is
one
of
the
better
of
a
sad
lot
it
pours
well
with
a
nice
cream
colored
not
creamy
head
and
decent
lacing
it
is
a
bit
fizzy
though
and
has
that
sweet
taste
and
feel
so
common
in
french
style
brews
despite
the
fact
that
the
eichhof
brewery
is
located
in
germanic
luzern
there
is
a
mild
hoppy
aftertaste
that
sets
it
apart
from
its
countrymen
if
you
have
to
drink
swiss
macrobrewed
beer
eichhofs
klosterbräu
is
a
good
option
more
of
an
amber
ale
than
a
brown
really
but
interms
of
catagorization
german
brown
ale
is
about
the
closest
bottle
conditioned
500ml
rather
unique
brew
in
that
its
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
light
belgian
dubbel
and
an
alt
amber
color
fruityspicey
semisweet
aroma
and
flavor
an
interesting
find
o
really
good
i
definitely
recommend
as
noted
above
deviates
from
the
original
style
but
in
a
good
way
i
paired
this
with
a
slice
of
apple
pie
and
it
was
exquisite
the
apples
cut
the
kind
of
heavy
yeasthop
feel
that
the
beer
has
and
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
kellerbiers
have
while
the
sweetness
kind
of
brought
out
the
sweaty
funky
yeast
character
of
the
beer
would
definitely
recommend
it
tasty
cellar
beer
unfiltered
and
smoothe
a
bit
above
average
taste
is
juicy
yeasty
bread
herbs
hint
of
lemon
with
a
full
body
and
full

lively
feel
o

rich

that
cant
be
found
outside

nyc
new
to

im
on
board
this
has
a
lot
going
for
it
not
for
a
newbie
but
try
it
as
a
flight
or
take
the
leap
if
you
know
your
depth
overall
an
enjoyable
german
brew
really
easy
to
drink
though
i
wouldnt

its

overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
brew
probably
the
best
kellerbier
ive
had
overall
even
at
this
bottling
age
this
keller
is
delivering
nicely
great
stuff
food
match
a
beer
with
both
lager
and
ale
characteristics
makes
for
a
good
allrounder
when
it
comes
to
food
matching
with
this

finish
this
was
very
enjoyable
and
could
win
me
ovre
to
the
idea
of
session
beers
this
would
be
quite
nice
to
sit
and
sip
for
a
long
period
of
time
on
a
warm
day
there
is
a
hint
of
oxidation
in
this
which
is
apparently
why
this
style
is
rarely
exported
meant
to
be
drunk
fresh
this
was
still
very
enjoyable
and
makes
me
want
to
try
a
fresh
one
o
it
is
so
awesomely
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
it
it
definitely
compares
to
a
lager
but
it
is
much
more
malty
and
tasteful
ill
go
and
get

remarks

m
at

disregard
those
scores
missing
the
depth
of
character
i
look
for
from
an
unfiltered
lager
but
has
a
thing
of
its
own
going
on
o
good
drinkability
like
a
good
german
lager
should
be
charming
am
i
missing
something
is
this
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
a
straight
honest
dark
lager
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
kellers
ive
ever
had
and
this
is
a
style
that
i
really
like
overall
pretty
awesome
intro
to
the
style
of
zwicklbier
i
will
seek
this
classic
out
and
more
like
it
more
often
4
o
decently
good
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
get
this
at
a
bar
once
in
a
while
that
being
said
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
pick
this
up
at
a
store
again
id
probably
want
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
and
depth
beer
is
nice
light
in
body
sweet
on
the
palate
interesting
beer
a
nice
wet
finish
not
very
heavy
on
the
yeast
in
the
palate
as
you
might
expect
a
zwickl
would
be
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
id
have
it
again
pours
a
fairlyclear
golden
color
surprisingly
clear
for
a
zwickel
a
good
white
head
with
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
bready
grain
and
a
slight
touch
of
hops
nothing
too
much
there
but
the
malt
presence
is
quite
nice
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
the
breadiness
of
it
is
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
very
crisp
dry
finish
finish
is
the
best
part
quite
well
done
served
in
a
tall
earthernware
mug
with
a
good
half
inch
or
so
of
creamy
offwhite
head
while
it
is
a
pretty
cool
mug
it
makes
the
beer
itself
difficult
to
see
however
after
the
head
subsided
the
beer
revealed
itself
to
a
be
a
light
copper
color
and
just
a
little
cloudy
the
aroma
was
not
strong
but
it
was
appetizing
light
breads
and
yeast
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
was
similar
with
a
some
light
caramel
malts
lots
of
bread
light
yeasty
esters
and
some
very
faint
earthy
hops
light
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
a
very
mild
bitterness
very
easy
drinker
paired
well
with
a
knockwurst
enjoyed
on
tap
at
gustavs
in
vancouver
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
lots
of
visible
carbonation
head
is
white
and
stands
about
1
finger
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
clean
sweet
malt
slight
earthy
and
citric
hops
taste
is
of
light
sweet
malts
very
much
in
the
german
style
i
also
get
a
earthy
citric
hop
bitterness
as
the
beer
crests
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
playful
carbonation
this
is
my
first
kellerbierzwickelbier
and
i
quite
enjoy
it
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bavarian
lodge
in
lisle
having
tried
chicagos
very
own
metropolitan
brewings
zwickl
before
and
liked
it
this
was
a
true
real
german
surprise
of
that
style
great
in
all
aspects
and
very
vert
drinkable
this
brew
is
a
must
try
for
all
german
lager
fans
awesome
mug
also
chugalug
another
brew
to
tick
off
my
list
of
want
to
try
beers
before
i
die
still
a
huge
list
fruity
caramel
flavor
light
and
fairly
simple
unfiltered
smooth
and
yeasty
easily
quaffed
in
larger
sips
light
lingering
bitterness
but
not
much
hop
presence
otherwise
balanced
and
easy
drinking
prost
d
good
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
standard
kellerbier
but
worth
finding
darkyellow
fluid
nice
for
an
unfiltered
beer
little
carbonation
smell
and
taste
of
banana
and
bread
this
is
not
a
spectacular
beer
to
be
honest
i
have
had
better
german
beers
overall
i
can
say
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
a
soft
taste
but
simply
not
a
shocking
beer
in
short
a
marzenlike
nutty
bready
and
quite
dry
kellerbier
with
aromatic
noble
hops
drinkability
is
ok
the
yeast
add
a
bit
more
then
your
average
maltier
lager
but
its
a
pretty
simply
flavored
brew
otherwise
good
one
to
try
delicious
stuff
quaffable
yeasty

theres
a
big

but
its

bready
slightly

flavors

midpalate
theres
a
bit
of

drying
malt
in
the
finish
bitterness
is
mild
and
doesnt
linger
very

stuff
but
its
not
a

pour
is
a
beautiful
doughy
head
of
off
white
atop
a
orange
brown
cloudiness
the
nose
is
apple
predominently
with
a
floral
basement
ashdust
and
honey
an
interesting
interaction
of
freshness
in
citrus
and
a
dingy
straw
moldy
wood
the
palate
was
the
balance
of
both
of
those
meeting
in
a
mild
bitter
finish
there
is
a
sweetness
as
the
flavor
contracts
of
brown
sugar
and
honey
a
nice
grainy
straw
and
wheat
hush
finish
not
as
earthy
as
some
but
particularly
husky
body
is
light
to
medium
not
sweet
or
sugary
in
the
least
a
perfect
marriage
of
hefeweizen
and
light
brown
ale
musty
rustic
yet
spicy
and
refreshing
and
tart
exactly
what
i
would
imagine
a
brewer
pulling
out
of
his
cellar
for
his
own
enjoyment
just
for
that
last
delicious
part
of
the
taste
its
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
the
rest
of
the
taste
and
structure
is
just
a
little
over
ordinary
i
really
want
to
try
this
again
really
weird
how
i
dont
think
this
is
all
too
good
but
that
little
taste
i
get
in
the
end
is
like
a
delicious
drug
the
slight
cloudiness
makes
an
appealing
glassful
slightly
brownish
amber
in
color
has
an
interesting
flavor
maybe
its
the
yeast
not
a
rich
beer
but
has
a
lot
of
mouthfeel
with
the
velvety
carbonation
malty
flavors
with
a
hint
of
caramel
modest
hop
taste
but
nicely
balanced
not
as
interesting
as
some
but
an
interesting
style
and
quite
drinkable
one
of
these
and
i
would
look
for
some
other
variety
of
flavor
however
an
average
kellerbier
not
very
good
not
bad
at
all
ive
never
actually
had
a
zwickl
before
but
its
delightful
bitter
with
a
sour
yeasty
twang
some
spicy
floral
hops
and
a
bitter
and
citrusy
end
the
mouthfeel
was
maybe
thinner
and
less
carbonated
than
i
wanted
it
to
be
but
overall
its
very
drinkable
and
i
hope
to
find
some
in
the
summer
d
very
very
drinkable
this
goes
down
a
treat
d
i
prefer
a
more
malty
subtle
beer
to
being
bashed
over
the
head
by
hops
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
a
rarity
on
tap
even
in
germany
if
you
can
find
it
get
it
md
this
is
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
kellerbier
in
the
bottleversion
that
ive
tasted
soothing
on
the
carbonation
with
marvellous
hoppiness
and
bitterness
threading
through
the
tasting
while
the
sediment
adds
some
more
body
and
depth
to
the
overall
nicely
balanced
flavour
profile
a
quaffable
german
bitter
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
for
my
taste
lahe
found
too

lacking

perhaps
it

you

feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
definitely
the
highlight
of
this
brew
as
the
lemon
meringue
aspect
was
really
quite
pleasant
and
inviting
the
flavor
was
fairly
light
but
still
quite
complex
definitely
a
well
done
czech
pilsener
if
im
honest
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
it
was
even
halfoff
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
cheers
mediumbodied
with
pleasant
modest
carbonation
makes
this
very
easy
on
the
palate
just
slightly
foaming
and
tingling
could
take
fairly
quick
swigs
of
this
if
desired
finish
is
rather
dry
overall
its
a
real
odd
one
but
the
primarily
apple
bent
on
this
just
doesnt
jive
with
me
so
ill
never
have
this
again
by
no
means
is
this
a
bad
beer
though
overall
this
is
kind
of
a
weird
beer
im
thinking
belgian
pale
maybe
im
not
really
sure
what
else
to
say
about
it
3
thanks
todd
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
prickly
level
of
carbonation
that
is
very
crisp
in
the
finish
all
around
this
is
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
i
feel
guilty
for
opening
this
and
not
sharing
it
with
someone
specifically
my
friend
pete
who
has
a
sick
fascination
with
well
made
pilsner
brews
i
need
to
seek
one
of
these
out
again
to
share
with
him
while
i
give
this
a
solid
a
rating
i
foresee
him
giving
this
nearly
a
perfect
5
across
the
board
overall
what
a
nice
refreshing
lager
very
nice
hop
profile
tartness
from
wild
yeast
that
some
people
seem
to
taste
is
nonsense
this
beer
is
sold
at
3
fonteinen
but
that
is
about
the
only
link
there
is
with
the
wild
yeast
double
checked
with
the
creators
great
for
the
style
overall
this
gets
high
marks
because
its
a
really
damn
interesting
beer
you
really
do
get
the
sense
that
youre
drinking
sort
of
a
throwback
beer
with
this
one
o
nice
beer
not
a
lager
as
the
name
says
but
a
crossover
between
lager
and
i
p
a
i
think
nice
refreshing
beer
i
gotta
say
at
first
i
was
thinking
no
way
was
this
a
czech
pilsner
but
after
tasting
and
smelling
the
big
spicy
and
floral
hop
combination
i
gotta
say
that
i
agree
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
slightly
clouded
light
golden
with
a
big
fluffy
crown
that
held
for
a
longtime
big
spicyfloral
hops
in
the
nose
to
go
with
big
yeastspicy
hops
really
hit
hard
on
the
palatemaybe
the
most
hoppy
non
american
lager
i
have
hadyeasty
and
fruity
its
very
well
rounded
this
is
a
great
lager
beerthe
label
says
best
belgian
lager
and
i
might
agree
with
thatnot
sure
if
its
a
close
rendition
of
a
bamburg
style
lager
though
d
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
i
was
very
surprised
to
find
this
in
dc
when
i
even
had
trouble
getting
it
in
beersel
anyway
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
will
definitely
pick
it
up
again
if
i
see
it
good
pilsener
quite
dry
and
spicy
this
beer
pours
a
mildly
hazy
banana
yellow
with
a
healthy
white
head
big
chunks
of
foam
stick
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
grassy
hops
clean
light
malt
and
very
mildly
fruity
yeast
the
fruitiness
is
reminiscent
of
peppercorns
and
dried
lemon
rind
the
taste
is
rather
dry
for
the
style
the
peppercorn
spice
is
much
stronger
on
the
tongue
and
the
grassy
hops
pack
a
pretty
good
punch
in
the
finish
this
is
not
really
an
easy
drinking
pils
but
its
interesting
without
straying
too
much
from
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
slick
the
dry
and
bitter
finish
is
just
this
side
of
harsh
price
was
a
bit
high
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
nice
hazy
straw
color
big
puffy
head
that
lifts
out
of
my
glass
like
a
meringue
the
amount
of
head
retention
left
me
in
awe
actually
smells
like
crisp
light
malt
and
grassy
hops
light
sweet
taste
and
a
balanced
earthy
bitterness
i
would
like
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
though
finish
ends
with
a
small
amount
of
acidity
completely
refreshing
crisp
carbonation
one
of
the
best
german
style
lagers
ive
had
left
me
wanting
more
wow
very
impressive
and
true
to
what
it
claims
to
be
a
lager
with
a
drie
fonteinen
personality
dark
burnt
gold
with
a
white
head
that
holds
and
goes
to
collar
nose
is
floral
and
bready
like
a
lager
should
be
with
some
citrus
and
honey
notes
popping
up
but
what
i
think
is
really
cool
is
that
there
seems
to
be
a
faint
rustic
musty
earthy
and
almost
sour
thing
going
on
in
the
background
especially
when
it
is
colder
which
was
strange
to
me
that
really
gives
it
an
authentic
taste
and
original
personality
good
balance
nice
light
body
that
was
a
tad
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
and
that
is
just
barely
really
a
fun
beer
to
try
and
quite
refreshing
too
bad
this
carried
a
5
99
price
tag
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
beersels
lager
has
a
favorable
impression
overall
but
it
is
very
minerally
salty
and
has
a
lot
of
sulfury
and
acidic
notes
that
compete
with
the
softer
malty
compounds
and
pure
floral
hop
notes
these
may
hurt
the
beer
as
much
as
they
help
the
best
lager
in
belgium
im
not
sure
but
certainly
it
is
the
most
interesting
one
ive
consumed
from
the
region
d
very
good
love
the
flavor
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
it
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
with
a
healthy
white
frothy
head
that
laces
pretty
well
as
things
progress
the
smell
is
faint
but
pleasant
notes
of
wheat
corn
light
citrus
and
a
vague
sense
of
red
berries
the
taste
follows
the
smell
berries
included
again
there
is
no
direct
berry
flavor
but
rather
a
general
impression
thereof
hiding
somewhere
in
the
distance
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
comes
through
very
well
but
the
finish
is
overly
dry
and
chalky
the
body
as
a
whole
is
quite
moderate
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
right
amount
of
smoothness
creating
a
highly
drinkable
pils
d
nice
enough
for
the
style
the
taste
is
a
good
fullbodied
meatyfruity
malty
grain
with
apple
pronounced
yeastiness
a
lot
of
lemon
it
is
fruityyeastygrainy
up
front
followed
by
a
lightly
tart
faintly
bitterleaning
lemonygrassy
finish
that
lingers
with
some
lightly
sweet
grain
and
spiciness
it
has
a
definite
spiceyyeasty
rustic
quality
throughout
drinkability
pretty
good
the
light
airy
carbonation
profile
keeps
this
one
easy
to
drink
but
theres
also
enough
flavor
within
to
keep
you
interested
very
earthy
and
bitter
from
the
hops
but
the
bitterness
is
well
balanced
by
a
pilsner
malt
backbone
hints
of
straw
and
grass
slightly
lactic
with
some
nice
sour
oak
notes
clean
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
interestingly
weird
beer
de
proef
brewing
a
lager
were
they
really
trying
for
a
czech
pilsner
too
much
fruitiness
and
phenols
if
were
being
strict
to
style
still
its
a
nice
drink
pour
is
golden
with
a
nice
white
soapy
head
about
2
fingers
which
fade
to
a
wonderful
lace
smell
at
first
is
grass
but
that
is
over
powered
with
a
distinct
lemon
there
is
an
subtle
aroma
of
straw
in
the
backbone
which
comes
through
in
the
palate
as
the
dry
ending
beer
is
honey
malt
sweet
and
has
a
belgian
blond
like
volume
of
pollen
somewhere
in
between
those
styles
really
pilsner
and
belgian
blonde
single
or
whatever
name
ba
has
for
it
the
dough
is
absolute
belgian
the
predominate
lemon
zest
nature
has
a
mild
apple
and
caramel
not
to
it
and
the
finish
is
a
very
slight
bitter
excellent
for
the
abv
would
rate
it
as
a
drinkable
pilsner
though
somewhat
unconventional
somewhere
between
beligian
and
plzen
dont
think
its
a
czech
pils
though
more
so
a
lemony
belgian
blond
with
a
bitter
pilsner
finish
picked
up
a
single
at
the
hopduvel
beer
store
in
gent
and
enjoyed
it
while
walking
around
town
on
a
bright
sunny
day
this
was
one
of
maybe
three
hoppy
beers
i
drank
while
in
belgium
it
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
victorys
prima
pils
but
a
notch
softer
with
the
bitterness
big
citrus
grassy
herbal
hops
delicious
find
this
beer
when
youre
in
belgium
d
this
is
a
light
crisp
easy
quaffing
beer
that
has
good
depth
of
flavor
and
a
nice
complexity
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
i
could
surely
see
others
enjoy
in
this
one
but
not
me
different
strokes
for
different
folks
indeed
this
would
not
be
a
pilsener
in
any
way
to
me
and
im
going
back
to
my
standbys

it
out
a

and

the
label
claims
that
beersel
lager
is
the
best
lager
of
belgium
since
i
havent
had
many
belgian
lagers
and
since
i
cant
recall
the
ones
i
have
had
im
inclined
to
agree
why
do
almost
all
beers
from
this
country
taste
fresh
while
a
considerable
portion
of
the
lowabv
lagers
from
the
rest
of
europe
taste
anything
but
pours
a
hazed
orange
yellow
with
a
nice
whitish
head
that
sticks
around
nose
is
very
crisp
and
clean
almost
seemed
to
have
a
green
apple
edge
at
first
minor
dough
kicks
in
flavor
is
definitely
interesting
very
unique
for
the
style
but
very
well
done
crisp
with
some
apple
on
there
and
a
defined
sweetness
but
really
it
is
fairly
dry
and
hits
smoothly
and
then
falls
off
but
in
a
good
way
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
has
a
full
carbonation
this
is
a
czech
pilsener
that
has
some
obvious
minor
belgian
influence
very
interesting
indeed
definitely
one
to
try
this
is
a
nice
czech
pilsner
but
not
as
crisp
and
as
biting
as
say
a
pilsner
urquell
or
budvar
which
i
find
more
representative
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
there
is
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
has
the
nice
musty
wet
grass
aromas
of
a
pilsner
with
some
sweeter
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
is
not
as
sharp
a
little
creamier
a
bit
more
floral
than
is
typical
of
the
style
there
is
some
breadiness
to
the
beer
along
with
noticeable
clean
pale
malts
there
is
a
bit
of
waterishness
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
and
less
the
peppery
bite
i
was
expecting
there
is
some
lemony
florals
in
the
finish
as
well
and
only
the
slightest
puckerishness
in
the
aftertaste
as
the
beer
settles
there
is
more
pungent
lemony
flavors
and
a
bit
more
dry
tartness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
not
the
best
pilsner
as
advertised
d
it
may
not
have
tons
of
competition
in
the
best
lager
of
belgium
category
so
if
i
concur
that
may
not
be
saying
much
to
say
its
a
highly
enjoyable
very
likable
lager
that
compares
quite
favorably
with
some
of
my
favorites
of
germanyeurope
and
the
us
is
quite
tasty
it
has
an
unheard
of
level
of
creaminess
that
contributes
alot
to
a
higher
overall
impression
i
could
have
several
of
these
on
a
warm
day
for
sure
it
would
likely
pair
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
unfiltered
pale
gold
cloudy
homogeneous
and
well
carbonated
the
head
is
pure
white
diminishing
but
longlasting
the
most
attractive
smallbubbled
crisp
carbonation
and
texture
enhance
the
soft
mineral
aspects
that
pair
with
the
haylike
pils
malts
to
create
an
ultimate
tool
for
refreshment
the
perfect
flavorful
quaffer
good
base
malt
also
ensures
a
certain
roundness
medium
bodied
lets
say
slightly
honeyed
though
not
biscuity
it
escapes
the
usual
oiliness
of
many
czech
pils
to
capture
the
essence
of
fresh
hops
the
vibrant
spiciness
highly
leafy
and
floral
yet
intense
in
a
way
that
cant
but
remind
of
citrus
an
elegant
creation
that
speaks
a
whole
book
about
the
no
compromise
approach
of
those
2
legendary
lambic
brewers
full
on
quality
great
ingredients
yet
openminded
and
creative
i
think
i
do
prefer
christoffel
blonde
but
i
consider
this
as
my
2nd
favorite
pils
for
now
competent
punchy
bitterness
dry
and
crisp
a
grand
hoppy
beer
like
i
enjoy
them

good

giving

aftertaste

remembers
of

bavarian
vollbier
taste
and
can
keep
up
with
them
minus

aswell
as
with

going

at

i
would
drink
early
and
often
something
perfect
for

again
good
stuff
o
i
cant
wait
to
grab
a
growler
of
this
stuff
in
the
summertime
hell
its
just
right
down
the
street
beer
is
light
in
body
and
grindingly
earthy
nice
wet
finish
tastes
great
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
variant
on
the
kolsch
very
fun
id
have
this
again
the
flavor
is
similar
bread
and
yeast
come
forward
with
the
base
in
the
background
nice
yeastiness
through
the
finish
moderate
hop
component
crisp
but
not
as
much
so
as
the
regular
kolsch
this
is
probably
halfway
between
kolsch
and
hefeweizen
in
body
and
feel
really
a
nicely
done
brew
bill
and
company
deserve
the
accolades
on
this
one
this
was
tasty
and
refreshing
with
the
unfiltered
nature
of
this
maybe
taking
away
a
bit
of
the
crispness
from
the
overall
flavor
profile
but
then
added
some
unique
qualities
to
this
that
more
than
made
for
it
overall
an
interesting
beer
overall
a
delicious
beer
a
good
cereals
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
the
taste
is
quite
unusual
but
very
pleasant
i
wish
i
had
several
more
bottles
of
it
malty
aroma
with
a
good
sized
dose
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
fruit
apples
and
apricots
fine
cream
colored
head
leaves
a
short
sheet
of
lace
hazy
almost
murky
chestnut
colored
beer
carbonation
in
the
beer
is
very
fine
and
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
very
light
malt
base
with
cocoa
and
toffee
along
with
some
apple
flavors
towards
the
finish
finishes
pretty
clean
from
the
apple
aromaflavors
i
would
guess
that
this
beer
is
either
fermented
a
little
warm
or
possibly
that
there
is
a
slight
infection
i
dont
mind
the
apple
and
i
think
that
it
actually
adds
to
the
drinkability
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
more
of
this
beer
851
if
you
want
the
taste
of
germany
go
for
this
easy
drinker
very
unfiltered
but
not
overwhelming
overall
the
best
non
european
bavarian
lager
i
have
had
o
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
more
i
realize
that
its
really
reminding
me
of
spaten
helles
from
years
back
and
munich
trips
the
breadiness
is
definitely
a
yeasty
character
more
than
a
melanoidin
breadiness
but
a
little
of
that
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
good
rendition
of
a
bavarian
lager
and
will
stand
up
to
the
best
i
hope
to
be
enjoying
more
of
this
over
the
summer
months
to
come
would
absolutely
purchase
and
drink
again
although
just
a
basic
lager
if
i
had
to
choose
a
simple
lager
to
drink
this
is
where
id
go
on
tap
at
kaiser
tiger
in
chicago
maybe
there
was
a
tap
line
issue
because
this
was
not
impressive
could
have
passed
as
a
domestic
macro
this
is
a
really
good
lager
my
first
offering
from
them
i
like
it
very
smooth
great
tasting
beer
overall
not
impressed
with
this
one
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
then
again
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
style
to
begin
with
i
love
a
good
lager
it
is
not
always
my
style
but
a
solid
well
made
version
can
be
very
rewarding
this
one
is
exceptional
it
is
slightly
hazy
and
golden
effervescent
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
of
bread
and
hops
slight
peppery
hop
scent
and
very
clean
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
a
little
up
front
sweetness
and
breads
malt
wonderful
overall
this
is
only
the
third
zwickel
that
i
have
ever
sampled
the
first
thing
that
i
thought
of
when
i
took
my
first
wiff
and
taste
of
this
beer
was
a
beer
that
is
similiar
to
an
octoberfest
style
beer
if
i
would
have
gotten
a
blind
pour
and
did
not
know
who
the
brewer
was
i
would
have
guessed
that
dan
carey
brewed
this
beer
and
we
all
know
that
dan
carey
is
the
master
when
it
comes
to
brewing
german
lagers
this
is
definately
a
high
quality
german
lager
and
it
is
on
the
same
level
as
any
of
dans
german
lagers
that
he
brews
i
give
this
beer
high
regards
so
get
a
sample
of
this
brew
from
urban
chestnut
what
a
gem
peppery
pleasantly
grassy
and
with
a
herbal
bite
the
finish
comes
quick
and
dry
its
refreshing
taste
gives
the
mediumlight
lager
an
effervescent
tingle
with
aftertaste
of
floral
bouquet
and
pepper
a
hint
of
sulfury
pilsner
malt
character
with
slightly
spicy
and
grassy
hops
flavor
is
crackery
with
an
interesting
citrus
tartness
at
the
finish
great
traditional
german
lager
taste
ill
try
it
again
in
the
future
and
change
my
rating
if
its
any
different
but
suffice
to
say
im
very
disappointed
this
is
a
well
crafted
zwickel
no
off
flavors
moderate
bitterness
crisp
and
most
importantly
easy
drinking
if
i
lived
in
urban
chestnuts
distribution
area
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
often
such
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
at
all
times
thanks
again
mark
i
dont
usually
seek
out
lagers
because
they
are
not
usually
very
complex
in
that
respect
this
beer
is
better
than
any
commercial
lager
out
there
but
its
still
approachable
to
the
uninitiated
bud
drinker
but
it
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
though
this
had
been
judged
from
the
perspective
of
someone
who
doesnt
really
like
lagers
golden
hued
with
great
clarity
minimal
head
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
with
a
bit
of
pale
malt
mouthfeel
is
salty
and
light
flavor
is
strong
in
terms
of
light
malt
and
somewhat
salty
and
buttery
theres
just
something
underwhelming
here
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
beers
in
this
style
and
from
the
the
brewery
overall
this
is
a
delicious
and
drinkable
lager
o
exellent
lager
and
a
style
that
i
have
not
had
before
an
easy
drinknig
local
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
drinks
so
easy
compares
favorably
with
most
of
the
kellerbiers
i
had
in
germany
i
would
buy
this
if
they
actually
distributed
in
sw
mizzou
o
enjoyable
beer
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
ehh
its
alright
herbal
character
seems
to
dominate
in
the
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
though
overall
this
is
the
first
of
the
eurolagers
with
the
skunky
flavor
profile
that
i
actually
kind
of
like
flavor
is
complex
with
light
grains
and
malts
melding
into
a
slightly
fruity
and
hoppy
finish
i
can
see
this
as
being
an
everyday
with
dinner
type
of
beer
overall
this
is
very
nice
all
around
lager
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
well
done
i
will
definitely
pick
some
up
next
time
im
in
st
louis
not
sure
where
he
got
it
but
my
boy
matt
hooked
me
up
with
a
bottle
o
this
stuff
during
our
last
gettogether
it
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
light
biscuit
and
grass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
everything
comes
through
dry
listless
and
strangely
bitter
that
isnt
to
say
that
the
bitterness
was
necessarily
unexpected
but
rather
it
was
unexpectedly
expressed
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
an
okay
beer
but
it
just
didnt
sit
too
well
with
me
nor
with
anyone
else
present
at
8

a
4pk
this
is
definitely
something
this
ale

would
gladly
pick
up

to

this
is
a

representation
of
the

id
guess
this
was
brewed
in
germany
if
i
tasted
it
blindly
great
work
ill
need
to
pick
up
more
from
this
brewery
on
my
next
trip
to
st

this
beer
pours

cloudy
light
bodied
pale
pale
gold
in
color
with

effervescent

the

is

pretty
straight
forward
it
features
blond
german
esque
malt
slight
hop
character
and
a
bit
of
corn
as
well
it
smells
like
a
fresh
helles
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
complex
the
pale
malt
offers
a
slight
sweetness
off
the
bat
the
bitterness
is
mellow
and
you
get
plenty
of
that
german
helles
character
with
a
touch
of
yeast
pretty
spot
on
for
a
zwickel
it
drinks
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
freshness
is
probably
this
beers
greatest
strongpoint
and
its
hard
to
find
this
type
of
unfiltered
lager
fresh
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
might
have
to
have
more
at
the
bar

this
traditional

beer
had
an
off

mouthfeel
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
had
a
base
of
sweet
pale
malt
well
balanced

clean
balanced

d
this
is

light
and
refreshing
beer
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
it
over
the
last
couple
of
months
and
was
shocked
when
i
realized
i
havent
reviewed
it
yet
being
one
of
the
flagship
brews
i
think
uc
chose
an
effective
way
to
introduce
people
to
the
brewery
overall
impression
this
wasnt
what
i
remember
as
the
zwickel
style
but
ill
take
it
as
it
is
i
looked
up
common
attributes
for
this
style
and
this
beer
almost
everything
fit
every
category
there
are
much
better
brews
from
u
c
but
i
enjoyed
this
greatly
had
no
other
choice
since
coming
from
a
growler
really
this
beer
was
quite
delicious
and
a
really
interesting
find
i
will
be
back
to
the
loop
district
again
and
i
certainly
hope
this
one
stays
on
the
menu
in
the
future
excellent
brew
d
i
love
this
beer
my
new
favorite
too
bad
it
is
not
going
to
be
around
long
might
have
to
move
to
st
louis
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
delicate
white
head
grassy
aroma
pale
malts
and
light
yeast
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
crisp
light
grassy
crackery
pale
malts
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
there
was
a
little
bit
of
spicy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
light
bodied
and
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
not
too
bad
but
ultimately
a
little
forgettable
overall
ok
btu
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
the
hops
came
though
decently
on
the
flavor
but
almost
nonexistant
on
the
nose
and
the
malts
were
the
opposite
not
very
well
balanced
and
the
lager
base
was
ok
but
not
great
could
use
more
work
but
still
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
i
would
probably
give
this
guy
a
whirl
at
room
temp
next
time
as
right
now
the
flavors
are
very
muted
and
tame
i
expected
a
bit
more
but
on
a
hot
summer
night
and
cold
beer
is
welcome
this
pilsner
is
more
prickly
than
most
although
the
hop
provides
some
of
this
bite
i
believe
most
of
this
comes
from
the
very
dry
pale
malt
base
the
swallow
is
dry
and
balanced
the
aftertaste
is
relatively
brief
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
this
might
be
enhanced
by
the
high
level
of
effervescence
d
pretty
plain
nothing
really
remarkable
here
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
pretty
good
session
beer
but
there
is
not
much
to
session
here
mf
mediumlight
bodied
dry
finish
4
25
beer
is
thin
and
watery
but
sweet
up
front
with
an
odd
bitterness
and
a
strong
midpalate
region
overall
its
pretty
good
but
not
my
favorite
pilsner
filtered
or
otherwise
just
an
average
beer
i
doubt
i
would
have
it
again

the
end

notes
with
hints

fruits
and
a

what
it
lacks
in

it
makes
up
for
in

quenches

pretty
good
for
a

pretty
easy

drink
a
couple
of
overall
good
beer
ill
be
trying
more
of
this
style
now
this
is
my
first
taste
of
the
style
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
i
can
imagine
this
one
coming
in
handy
on
a
warm
german
day
in
a

i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50

the
beer
was

a

the
head
was

was

was

would

liked
it

would
buy
again

a

enough
to
distinguish
this
as

this
is
an

beer
but
maybe
not
a

memorable
one
and
yes
i
would
still
have
another

bought

i
look

kinda
like

however
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
essentially
flavorless
with
maybe
some
light

and
a
touch
of

the
body
is
light
with

it
leaves
almost
no

the
carbonation
is
medium
to
light
the
few
medium
sized
bubbles
very
fresh
the
liquid
is
dry
an
ok
beer
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
its
too
old
and
the
flavour
has
deteriorated
the
malt
is
quite
good
with
depth
provided
by
the
yeast
and
a
hoppy
bitterness
but
the
stale
notes
take
away
from
the
pleasure
of
drinking
it
ill
have
to
rereview
when
i
have
a
fresher
bottle
o
the
first
keller
ive
ever
had
and
it
was
quite
a
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
light
bodied
and
at
the
same
time
quite
hoppy
beer
from
germany
recommended
low
fine
carbonation
typical
of
the
style
results
from
maturation
in
unbunged
casks
the
rather
nonsweet
nutlike
malt
flavor
gets
balanced
towards
the
surprisingly
clean
dry
finish
a
result
of
cask
maturation
with
a
pronounced
bitterness
and
mild
hopspiciness
the
suspended
yeast
adds
earthy
touch
to
the
flavor
aftertaste
is
bitter
with
slight
nutty
astringency
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
motuhfeel

into
the
mug
this
really
is
a
nice
one
i
dont
know
why
it
isnt
widely
distributed
in
my
area
give
me
a
beer
garden
and
a
sunny
day
and
i
would
happily
drink
this
all
day
nice
to
have
a
good
bottles
keller
regret
doing
this
because
ive
had
good
bottles
of
this
in
the
past
but
this
was
just
tired
slightly
cloudy
faded
amber
to
look
at
with
some
loose
fluffy
head
this
both
smelt
and
tasted
tinny
and
slightly
cabbagy
dont
think
this
was
a
storage
problem
as
this
was
a
very
recent
purchase
apparently
from
a
new
shipment

easy

beer
that
i
would
like
when
im
just
wanting
an
easy
to
drink
german
beer
well
carbonated
almost
fizzy
to
be
honest
pleasant
enough
though
taste
is
indeed
fairly
similar
to
a
traditional
german
bock
beer
but
not
quite
as
sweet
and
fullbodied
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
to
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
the
balance
on
the
beer
is
nice
carbonation
is
very
fine
and
lends
a
bit
of
creaminess
to
it
not
too
shabby
an
interesting
brew
that
i
would
like
to
try
fresh

pretty

quite

given
the

overall
very
easy

interesting
style
but
not
jaw

unique
that
id

this
again

nothing

only
at

a
bit
onedimensional
nice
light
quenching
body
with
high
yet
soft
carbonation
while
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
far
from
spectacular
and
not
one
i
would
search
for
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
seesionable
beer
with
some
substance
to
it
that
makes
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
wont
be
the
last
time
i
seek
this
beer
out
overall
an
excellent
and
suprisingly
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
best
keller
beers
i
have
tried
overall
this
is
a
distinctive
almost
raw
beer
that
is
not
very
smooth
i
quite
liked
it
but
others
may
be
put
off
by
the
raw
nature
of
this
brew
drinkability
is
very
good
a
bit
of
surprise
here
i
think
i
am
going
to
go
back
to
the
store
and
grab
some
more
of
these
nice
flavorful
and
sessionable
beer
conclusion
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
i
must
say
i
was
nervous
it
was
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
friars
and
literally
was
caked
with
dust
and
random
dirtdebris
i
figured
this
was
long
past
its
prime
but
wanted
to
try
a
keller
bier
im
glad
i
did
for
a
typically
ale
guy
this
is
a
fullbodied
smooth
and
tasty
lager
full
of
character
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
beers
in
this
style
d
not
quite
a
diamond
in
the
rough
but
a
very
solid
lager
nonetheless
i
could
see
myself
pairing
this
with
some
german
sausage
or
knocking
a
couple
back
on
a
hot
summer
day
md
somehow
this
beer
is
pretty
attractive
due
to
the
level
of
bitterness
from
hops
while
the
overall
balance
is
way
different
from
all
other
kellerbier
including
the
caskconditioned
version
of
this
very
same
bier
ive
tried
i
suspect
the
bottling
or
storage
process
has
probably
gone
wrong
for
this
batchbottle
hence
a
slightly
stronger
sour
element
and
a
less
lively
texture
to
the
overall
balance
drinkability
is
very
good
due
to
the
low
abv
and
more
importantly
its
just
a
darn
good
taster
kellers
me
likes
the
style
keller
bier
is
a
tradition
of
the
franconian
region
of
bavaria
and
st
georgenbraeu
leads
the
way
i
enjoyed
this
beverage
several
times
while
in
bamberg
but
most
noticeably
at
the
sandkerwa
street
festival
it
pours
a
yellowbrownish
color
and
has
a
very
frothy
thick
head
the
taste
is
mostly
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
towards
the
end
this
beer
should
be
enjoyed
either
in
a
tall
seidel
or
in
the
traditional
st
georgenbrau
ceramic
krug
it
goes
great
with
white
meats
schnitzel
and
pommes
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
oversized
triple
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
pond
water
brown
with
a
big
2
inch
frothy
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
as
the
beer
resides
the
aroma
is
best
described
as
raw
heavy
oak
raw
grains
fresh
malt
hay
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
the
taste
is
just
as
complex
with
raw
grains
dominating
the
flavor
with
earth
hay
and
what
reminds
me
of
just
a
bit
of
cream
and
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
leaves
a
nice
oily
coating
holding
the
flavors
in
as
one
of
the
more
rare
styles
of
beer
i
would
love
to
see
a
revival
of
it
i
find
it
really
tasty
god
love
those
germans
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
bit
slick
not
too
much
carbonation
and
rather
dry
to
the
mouth
pours
a
clearish
auburn
brown
with
a
onefinger
head
that
receeds
slowly
citric
floral
even
soapy
hops
mixed
with
some
malts
like
caramel
and
maybe
some
roasted
plus
hints
of
dark
fruits
medium
to
fullbodied
and
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
chunk
of
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
along
with
some
citric
hopiness
contains
hints
of
huskiness
and
veginess
and
finishes
great
with
a
dry
backbite
some
dark
fruits
like
cherries
andor
apples
and
maybe
some
figs
are
in
the
body
also
never
had
keller
bier
before
but
if
they
are
all
like
this
i
will
have
to
look
for
more
d
this
is
a
great
drinking
brew
i
am
so
happy
that
i
came
across
it
will
definitely
seek
out
again
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
not
amazing
but
its
certainly
decent
and
quite
sessionable
drinkability
is
high
wow
a
great
beer
i
never
heard
of
and
randomly
grabbed
in
fact
its
the
first
time
ive
ever
even
had
the
style
but
one
i
will
surely
revisit
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
finish
and
i
find
myself
wanting
another
its
nothing
fantastic
and
amazing
but
its
pretty
good
and
i
find
myself
thinking
that
this
could
probably
go
pretty
well
with
a
wide
vareity
of
food
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
lighter
brew
without
much
character
and
a
somewhat
flabby
overall
profile
resembles
a
weak
nut
brown
ale
feel
is
fairly
full
for
a
lager
and
comes
off
as
being
somewhat
sticky
and
lingers
fairly
drinkable
and
somewhat
quirky
i
wonder
how
close
this
is
to
the
original
keller
biers
id
like
to
try
one
fresh
in
germany
mouthfeel
is
more
on
the
lighter
side
this
is
an
interesting
style
but
one
im
probably
not
going
to
go
back
to
this
beer
may
not
be
for
everyone
as
it
has
none
of
the
clean
lager
taste
one
would
expect
out
of
german
lager
the
diacetyl
is
apparent
which
many
find
to
be
a
minus
but
this
beer
is
wonderfully
complex
in
a
way
many
belgium
ales
are
this
style
will
probably
go
the
way
boyan
and
gose
went
only
beer
aficianados
and
loyal
franks
seem
to
enjoy
this
ancient
beer
style
ah
a
kellerbier
gotta
love
an
unfiltered
lager
the
appearance
is
mixed
because
theres
great
retention
and
lacing
but
its
only
slightly
hazy
after
the
aroma
of
shipping
and
handling
dissipate
youre
left
with
a
very
bready
malt
that
malt
continues
into
the
flavor
but
with
a
grassy
hops
flavor
that
properly
overbalances
the
malt
and
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
slight
mineral
tinge
this
beer
is
really
just
missing
the
odd
cellar
flavors
you
expect
in
a
kellerbier
maybe
its
because
of
the
travel
i
dont
know
its
still
a
tasty
brew
nevertheless
pours
out
a
clear
copper
with
a
nice
big
head
i
see
the
yeasties
in
the
bottle
so
ill
get
some
in
here
as
well
but
theres
not
a
lot
of
em
and
most
have
settled
in
the
bottle
pretty
solidly
head
is
pretty
stiff
and
laces
nicely
first
impression
is
big
perfumy
floral
hops
and
an
earthychalky
undertone
fairly
dry
with
a
moderate
mouthfeel
and
a
splash
of
fruitiness
im
tasting
some
dry
nuttiness
coarse
graininess
and
a
moderate
bitter
finish
2nd
impression
is
some
honey
sweetness
in
this
nose
but
not
in
flavour
but
theres
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
taste
now
fairly
hoppy
actually
and
a
bit
of
an
astringent
mouthfeel
too
bad
i
have
no
other
keller
bier
to
compare
this
to
but
my
impressions
of
this
on
its
own
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
brew
with
a
well
balanced
flavour
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
brown
with
a
sizeable
light
tan
head
nose
is
pretty
muted
hops
are
all
that
seem
to
peek
out
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
with
what
seems
like
a
grainlike
influence
feel
is
okay
not
much
really
happening
there
drinkable
sure
but
for
the
price
hell
no
finish
was
well
rounded
and
of
medium
duration
not
a
bad
beer
d
being
my
first
kellerbier
i
had
already
seen
its
style
information
before
and
was
always
interested
but
had
yet
to
get
my
hands
on
one
after
trying
it
im
quite
amazed
and
can
really
taste
the
craftsmanship
that
goes
into
a
cellared
lager
not
only
is
the
flavor
mellow
and
complex
the
body
and
taste
is
balanced
rather
deftly
as
for
drinkability
this
is
amazing
quaffable
as
im
already
trying
to
figure
out
ways
to
acquire
more
of
this
stuff
due
to
its
rarity
in
the
surrounding
area
im
not
sure
ill
be
able
to
find
many
others
of
its
kind
but
i
was
definitely
impressed
by
this
offering
and
hope
to
find
more
500ml
bottle
purchased
for
3
50
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
light
gold
aroma
is
lagery
but
decent
the
flavour
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
straightforward
lager
but
with
a
slightly
stronger
aftertaste
than
average
i
sought
out
this
beer
after
enjoying
the
harpoon
kellerbier
but
i
preferred
the
harpoon
more
drinkability
this
beer
was
great
never
had
this
style
before
and
was
very
happy
this
couldnt
be
a
whole
lot
simpler
and
yet
it
is
so
utterly
drinkable
from
the
cutanddry
clean
taste
to
the
fullbutnotheavy
mouthfeel
that
its
hard
not
to
admire
a
winner
d
i
went
into
this
beer
my
first
keller
bier
expecting
some
sort
variation
on
a
basic
german
pilsener
but
this
is
so
much
more
complex
and
odd
i
could
drink
this
all
night
still
the
500ml
minibomber
drinks
refreshingly
well
on
a
hot
day
even
though
the
rawness
could
be
a
factor
by
the
second
bottle
this
is
as
a
lager
should
be
pours
a
dark
amber
with
two
finger
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
hops
and
maybe
a
medicinal
quality
taste
is
malts
slightly
funky
and
clean
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
it
has
its
own
complexity
not
on
the
level
of
a
belgian
ale
but
it
is
a
great
lager
and
very
quaffable
this
beer
feels
like
it
was
meant
to
be
served
in
a
liter
mug
on
a
hot
day
and
enjoyed
with
friends
the
mug
needs
to
be
refilled
d
intriguing
and
good
worth
a
try
d
interesting
well
balanced
beer
that
like
most
german
offerings
are
easy
drinking
and
entirely
sessionable
a
nice
beer
for
quaffing
in
the
summer
time
but
certainly
nothing
special
pours
a
threefinger

i
see
this
as
previously
being
described
as
having
a
raw
taste
id
have
to
agree
a
pretty
simple
beer
filling
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
i
def
enjoyed
it
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
pub
in
bamberg
several
years
ago
i
ranked
the
appearance
as
average
because
i
couldnt
really
see
the
beer
due
to
it
being
served
in
a
ceramic
stein
however
this
beer
tasted
great
ive
had
the
bottled
version
and
liked
it
but
the
draft
version
was
truly
excellent
this
was
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
while
traveling
throughout
germany
taste
is
malty
which
is
just
a
tad
sweet
fullbodied
and
rich
in
dextrines
more
like
a
lot
of
munich
malt
has
been
used
there
is
very
little
bitterness
drinkability
is
good
and
this
beer
is
better
than
any
other
kellerbier
i
had
the
others
were
all
more
like
sweet
pilsners
without
the
hops
this
beer
is
decent
d
not
bad
doesnt
hold
my
interest
too
well
but
its
still
a
fair
beer
thats
worthy
of
a
try
st

brau

pours
a
light

toasted
malt
dominates
the
aroma
starts
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
that
fades
into
a
hoppy
flavor
finishing
with
more
toasted
malt
i
think
this
is
only
the
second
keller
bier
ive
had
but
this
one
is
good
enough
to
make
me
wish
there
were
more
available
ill
be
drinking
this
one
again
recommended
its
aged
in
oak
barrels
in
caves
for
heavens
sake
what
more
could
you
ask
of
a
german
lager
unfiltered

no

with
both

kellers

fantastic

brews
that
are
worth
tasting
yes
the
price
prohibits
frequent

but
a
real
treat
for
any
beer
lover
this
beer
drinks
well
refreshing
and
dry
enough
to
avoid
being
cloying
it
lacks
some
brightness
to
get
me
to

again

again
however
pours

a

not

thought
it
to
be

overall
a

good

with

i
have
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
its
still
not
a
brew
that
goes
down
real
easy
ill
be
open
to
trying
this
again
but
wont
be
rushing
out
to
buy
more
anytime
real

mouthfeeldrinkability
at

the
carbonation
is
quite
aggressive
making
the
beer
challenging
to
swallow
and
to
appreciate
its
wholeness
its
more
than
just
prickly
but
it
does
equal
if
not
exceed
the
levels
of

i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
be
interested
in
comparing
this
to
others
of
its
kin
but
there
is
a
relative
indifference
to
each
next
sip
for
me
personally

finish
has
a
nice
little
bite
moderately
light
body
and
a
lack
of
carbonation
give
it
a
waterz
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
i
really
like
about
the
beer
is
the
nice
hop
bite
in
the
finish
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
easily
but
its
not
worth
seaking
out
i
would
give
this
one
a
more
extensive
review
but
ive
never
had
this
style
before
however
from
what
i
can
taste
it
isnt
wildly
different
from
many
other
types
of
german
lagers
its
got
that
special
maltiness
that
is
at
once
smooth
rich
and
subtly
multilayered
the
most
dominant
characteristic
is
a
really
tasty
slightly
toasted
caramel
flavor
but
it
is
nicely
blended
with
other
mellow
but
delicious
malt
flavors
and
its
all
balanced
by
a
firm
hop
bite
i
would
definitely
say
that
this
one
emphasizes
the
malt
but
because
everything
is
so
well
blended
and
balanced
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
flaw
to
sum
it
up
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
welldone
slightly
hoppier
vienna
lager
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
this
one
i
am
quite
pleased
to
be
sampling
an
authentic
representation
of
this
style
as
i
have
sought
such
for
some
time
i
can
report
that
it
poured
much
darker
thani
thought
it
would
and
had
a
bit
of
sediment
and
debris
floating
about
it
was
a
very
cloudy
brown
leather
colour
and
had
a
white
soapy
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
smell
was
malty
and
a
bit
sour
taste
was
sour
up
front
and
bitter
on
the
finish
unlike
anything
i
have
had
before
but
i
must
admit
i
rather
enjoyed
it
its
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
while
carbonation
was
nearly
nonexistent
seemed
quite
easy
to
drink
most
unusual
but
interesting
and
pleasant
at
the
same
time
ill
probably
buy
this
again
cheers
very
decieveing
smell
leaves
the
taste
a
bit
dissapointing
very
watery
thin
mouthfeel
a
malty
finish
but
nothing
over
the
top
the
same
woodsy
earthy
notes
as
teh
nose
easy
to
sit
around
and
sip
an
interesting
beer
not
something
i
would
go
to
often
but
interesting
none
the
less
maybe
paired
with
some
big
ass
german
food
like
brats
and
kraut
yeah
that
would
work
this
is
a
nice
mellow
easy
drinking
beer
that
id
like
to
grab
a
few
more
of
to
get
a
better
feel
of
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
not
something
you
cant
put
down
mk
clear
coppery
gold
colour
with
a
light

though
toasted

in

a
bit
of
earthiness
and

too
moderate
bitterness
balances
the
toasty
malt
and
hint
of
caramel
hop
flavour
is
fairly
pronounced
especially
towards
the
end
and
a
nice
combination
of
malt
and
hops
lingers
soft
palate
moderate
carbonation
and
light
bodied
ive
been
on
a
bit
of
a
lager
kick
lately
and
this
one
really
fit
in
with
that
theme
delicate
interesting
refreshing
beers
poured
a
semicloudy
orangerust
color
with
a
frothy
white
colored
head
lots
of
lacing
left
behind
in
my
glass
subtle
aromas
of
alcohol
wax
toasted
sugar
and
figs
the
taste
was
sweet
with
lingering
fruitderived
bitterness
pronounced
roasted
characteristics
like
that
of
toasted
bread
throughout
slighly
chewy
with
an
underlying
smoke
residue
in
my
mouth
very
smooth
and
flavorful
pint
bottle
more
hoppy
than
expected
from
a
german
beer
a
bit
overcarbonated
initially
tasted
like
a
biere
de
garde
and
then
some
creamy
malty
finish
spicescorriander
and
something
else
vegetable
medium
bodied
more
interesting
with
lunch
nice
one
d
a
solid

fullflavored
yet
easy
to
drink
this
one
has

written

over

hazy

thin

white

minimal

nice
aroma
good
dose
of
earthy
hops
blend
with
some
cracker
like
maltiness
interesting
taste
for
not
having
many
keller
biers
ive
just
got
a
feeling
anyway
that
this
is
how
theyre
supposed
to
taste
rugged
maltiness
kind
of
grundgy
hops
add
their
say
with
some
herbal
traits
and
even
a
little
pine
nice
little
bitterness
really
enjoyable
brew
this
is
definitely
sessionable
pours
a
thick
and
reddish
amber
quite
cloudy
with
minimal
head
smells
of
tons
of
malt
and
some
slightly
sweet
cherries
but
overall
the
smell
is
pretty
mild
the
taste
starts
with
cherrysweet
malts
that
linger
for
a
bit
before
morphing
into
malt
bitterness
on
the
midpalate
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
wellrounded
and
sultry
on
the
tongue
what
a
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
i
could
put
away
several
pints
of
this
stuff
and
would
be
enraptured
in
the
process
bravo
the
abundant
hop
flavour
may
not
be
as
approachable
to
some
people
but
i
think
is
how
the
style
should
be
done
mainly
because
its
ungespundet
unbunged
and
allowed
to
breath
in
solid
oak
barrels
before
being
tapped
the
500
ml
brown
bottle
adorned
with
fraktur
lettering
yielded
golden
amber
kellerbier
that
was
clear
until
the
yeast
was
swirled
in
it
looked
quite
good
with
a
soft
but
steady
carbonation
and
a
small
head
the
smell
was
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
noble
hop
spiciness
the
initial
flavor
was
quite
hoppy
for
a
german
beer
the
hops
were
riding
atop
a
seemingly
weak
pale
malt
base
tasting
a
little
like
juicy
fruit
chewing
gum
the
malt
became
thicker
and
more
caramelized
mid
palette
ending
in
a
note
of
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
the
yeast
pour
added
some
earthiness
and
brought
out
some
sweet
apple
flavor
to
the
forefront
the
beer
was
medium
thick
in
the
mouth
and
a
little
oily
interesting
lager
exhibiting
a
lot
of
apa
like
qualities
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
balanced
and
unique
it
has
a
lot
of
yeast
flavor
and
a
lot
of
other
good
flavors
try
it
body
is
medium
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
soft
texture
accentuated
by
fine
trickling
pinpoint
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
one
is
enough
yeah
i
could
definatelty
knock
back
of
few
of
these
badboys
too
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
so
incredibly
thin
but
eh
no
beer
is
perfect
drinkability
drinkability
is
alright
the
lagerstyle
flavors
are
softer
and
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
an
interesting
offshoot
for
fans
of
german
lagers
this
i
believe
is
my
first
kellerbier
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
its
certainly
well
made
theres
no
place
to
hide
a
defect
in
a
beer
like
this
there
is
a
caramelnut
aroma
and
flavor
that
is
fairly
pronounced
in
this
beer
with
not
much
else
going
for
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
try
other
kellerbiers
in
the
future
mouthfeel
somehow
tastes
like
an
aged
beer
in
its
intermingled
complexity
and
grace
if
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
this
is
a
slurp
of
heaven
this
kellerbier
poured
a
hazy
light
brown
caramel
color
difficult
to
judge
in
a
ceramic
krug
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
a
great
malty
and
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
was
malty
with
good
hoppiness
to
balance
and
a
touch
of
something
grassy
or
perhaps
wortlike
good
flavor
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
and
with
a
dry
hoppy
finish
this
was
very
enjoyable
what
a
difference
freshness
makes
with
this
beer
a
solid
session
beer
one
that
i
would
like
to
try
paired
with
some
brats
and
kraut
overall
this
one
is
quite
interesting
not
exactly
a
gem
that
i
found
imho
but
a
nice
curve
ball
while
sampling
beers
d
this
is
a
nicely
complex
beer
that
has
good
flavor
and
a
bit
of
freshness
about
it
i
feel
that
a
cask
or
fresher
sample
would
have
an
amazing
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
paired
with
a
grilled
ham
and
cheese
and
quenched
and
refreshed
well
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
would
like
to
revisit
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
the
head
is
small
and
white
but
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
interesting
malt
rye
and
some
smoked
aromas
too
the
taste
is
very
balanced
and
smooth
the
dominant
flavor
is
mint
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
it
is
not
huge
and
overpowering
but
it
is
satisfiying
and
enjoyable
fairly
clean
inviting
nose
slightly
nutty
malt
flavour
light
flowery
hop
notes
some
grassy
notes
mixed
in
for
good
measure
medium
bodied
smooth
moderate
carbonation
interesting
overall
my
first
keller
bier
and
it
was
an
interesting
experience
im
not
going
to
run
out
and
drink
every
one
on
the
block
but
it
was
a
nice
enough
brew
the
interesting
malt
profile
marries
well
with
the
aggressive
hopping
to
produce
an
outstanding
drinkability
for
a
lager
style
definitely
the
wildest
german
lager
ive
tried
to
date
very
interesting
and
certainly
worth
a
try
comments
st
georgen
claims
that
this
bier
is
brewed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
it
was
in
1624
when
the
bräuhaus
first
opened
they
brew
the
beer
with
lots
of
hops
over
an
open
fire
move
the
wort
into
open
wooden
fermentation
vessels
and
add
the
bottomfermenting
yeast
then
mature
the
beer
in
the
cold
caves
of
buttenheim
to
release
most
of
the
carbonation
boy
you
cant
make
a
beer
like
this
in
the
us
drinkability
a
new
style
to
me
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
to
a
point
i
liked
the
sweet
and
bitter
complements
along
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
but
ultimately
the
sweetness
limited
my
desire
to
consume
more
of
this
brew
had
this
in
a
gausthaus
right
off
the
main
drag
in
nurnberg
in
december
this
bier
rocked
tons
of
malt
and
slight
yeast
hops
hit
you
up
front
and
the
nose
with
yeasty
malt
tones
sneak
in
had
to
pour
into
water
glass
to
evaluate
appearance
since
was
served
in
a
stein
krug
alcohol
taste
present
but
barely
so
in
line
with
the
abv
decent
head
retention
wish
i
could
have
one
right
now
but
i
will
settle
for
remembering
the
1st
time
i
had
it
during
a
visit
to
weinnachts
markt
great
memory
great
bier
a
good
beer
and
obscure
and
interesting
style
with
a
curious
historty
and
origin
try
it
out
i
like
this
keller
beer
quite
a
bit
flavor
is
again
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
sufficiently
full
and
the
finish
is
long
lasting
and
dry
the
bitterness
seems
a
touch
out
of
place
but
that
is
a
minor
quibble
the
cocoa
and
spices
linger
a
long
while
altogether
quite
a
nice
brew
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
im
not
too
sure
about
the
aroma
caramel
malts
slight
spice
and
some
offaromas
make
up
the
nose
the
flavor
has
a
nice
caramel
backbone
with
a
little
spice
and
a
bit
of
citrus
seems
old
but
thats
what
its
supposed
to
be
the
body
is
lacking
a
bit
but
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
im
happy
to
be
trying
this
stlye
it
pours
a
deep
golden
color
almost
amber
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
interesting
lots
of
caramel
and
graineyness
with
almost
a
slight
pepperyness
from
the
interaction
of
these
two
aroma
the
flavor
is
not
all
that
bad
grainey
slighly
caramel
with
a
slight
lemoney
sing
and
a
slight
pepperyness
interesting
brew
the
feel
is
moderate
at
best
with
just
a
slight
carbonation
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
have
this
again
but
it
is
by
far
not
the
worst
brew
i
have
had
recently
its
nice
hazy
deep
amber
with
receding
medium
coarse
head
with
little
lacing
sweet
bready
nose
with
little
evidence
of
aromatic
hops
doughy
sweet
malt
lightly
fruity
balance
attempted
by
the
light
bitterness
at
the
end
surprisingly
unpilsnerlike
due
to
the
depth
of
the
caramelized
malt
flavors
good
beer
i
liked
it
very
much
very
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
a
pleasure
to
drink
50
cl
bottle
with
no
freshness
dating
pours
a
slightly
hazed
light
copper
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
beige
head
malty
and
husky
aroma
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
and
some
mild
peppery
notes
mildly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
light
husky
and
hoppy
astringency
in
the
finish
that
helps
cut
the
sweetness
medium
to
fuller
bodied
due
to
the
unfiltering
otherwise
it
might
be
medium
to
lighter
bodied
carbonation
is
good
overall
an
enjoyable
unfiltered
lager
with
some
hallmark
qualities
sampled
at
the
southside
beer
expo
frankfort
nice
to
finally
encounter
one
of
the
more
elusive
commerical
styles
out
there
a
nice
little
noseful
of
hops
for
what
appears
to
be
your
standard
lager
low
carbonation
as
advertised
but
still
enough
to
give
this
a
light
zing
not
what
i
expected
from
looking
at
the
bottle
much
darker
then
expected
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
some
what
clowdy
and
smells
like
a
red
ale
the
yeast
sticks
out
at
you
on
the
first
drink
and
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
noticeable
it
was
very
smooth
with
almost
a
honey
like
after
taste
alot
of
lace
hanging
around
the
glass
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
only
down
side
i
found
was
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
bitter
and
a
little
less
sweet
it
stays
true
to
the
german
style
and
was
recomended
to
me
from
some
one
that
used
to
live
there
feel
is
right
where
the
drying
husk
stuff
is
at
middle
dryness
glimpsing
carbonation
slight
herbal
more
so
slight
burnt
even
more
so
slight
toasted
its
a
bit
weird
at
first
but
kinda
grows
on
ya
and
does
seem
decent
enough
once
it
sits
ok
but
not
quite
good
enough
no
seek
out
again
this
one
is
a
thick
yeasty
murky
dark
tanlvs
good
lace
on
glass
and
forms
a
beautiful
white
head
smell
is
clean
slightly
woody
but
still
mild
and
nondescript
the
taste
has
a
nice
malt
bite
with
some
cedarry
woodiness
the
hops
are
hard
to
spot
in
terms
of
a
bitter
taste
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
nothing
upfront
this
is
a
regal
brew
to
be
enjoyed
on
special
occasions
i
would
love
to
try
it
ontap
mf
is
okay
and
drinkability
is
also
someaht
avg
or
slightly
better
this
seems
like
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
a
wide
variety
of
food
this
poured
clumsily
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
glass
the
color
is
a
very
deep
amber
a
bit
murky
and
topped
with
a
slight
head
of
almond
colored
foam
the
smell
gives
only
subtle
hints
of
the
rich
caramel
malt
that
hides
within
this
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
with
an
underlying
spicy
hop
harshness
that
leaves
a
bitterness
in
the
throat
this
isnt
altogether
unpleasant
and
actually
gives
the
beer
a
nice
balance
medium
light
in
body
simple
in
taste
a
fine
german
lager
taste
is
amber
malty
but
could
have
a
litle
more
body
for
the
beercolor
that
suggests
full
maltflavour
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
far
most
out
of
hops
but
thought
i
tasted
a
litle
roast
also
good
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
orange
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
aroma
a
nice
sweet
orange
tangerine
yeast
sugar
hoppy
flavor
malty
fruity
honey
hopps
a
little
sourness
and
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
not
to
bad
kellerzwickel
biers
are
a
subset
of
the
lager
style
that
i
previously
knew
nothing
about
but
which
have
impressed
me
so
far
granted
ive
only
had
two
but
each
one
was
a
balanced
incredibly
quaffable
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
again
and
again
if
youre
curious
about
the
style
st
georgenbraus
version
is
as
good
a
place
to
start
as
any
i
wish
i
could
find
more
kellers
for
a
more
adequate
picture
of
the
style
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
braonzeorangered
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
fades
into
a
aolid
18
layer
smells
of
cinnamon
and
earthy
woody
flavors
alomst
proclaiming
this
style
as
an
anachronism
in
the
corny
lager
beer
world
of
today
taste
is
full
and
malty
but
the
hop
presence
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
usual
lager
style
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
very
low
carbonation
levels
but
this
beer
is
unique
in
so
many
ways
that
that
is
easily
overlooked
cheers
this
was
a
surprise
truthfully
i
was
expecting
a
boring
german
ale
with
just
a
tad
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
caramel
malt
instead
you
get
something
much
like
a
british
bitter
or
even
an
american
amber
ale
i
dont
know
if
this
is
typical
for
the
style
but
if
it
is
its
a
shame
that
its
such
a
rare
beer
style
the
body
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
a
good
white
head
the
aroma
is
hops
first
oranges
and
juicy
ones
at
that
and
flowers
the
flavor
is
very
malty
almost
worty
but
it
isnt
very
sweet
the
flavors
are
all
bright
and
fresh
very
quaffable
excellent
session
beer
this
brew
is
a
brown

this

has
a
nice

and
some

love
the

it

on
you
and
was
a
real
bargain
at

glad
to
have
tried
this
style
at
once
had
on
tap
this
weekend
at
redbones
and
had
two
as
it
was
really
good
a
pint
was
a
cloudy
burnished
bronzetangerine
color
rather
fruity
aroma
more
of
the
applepear
vein
than
anything
else
awesome
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
i
thought
while
imbibing
that
the
taste
was
also
a
bit
fruity
but
i
picked
up
some
lavender
notes
which
were
also
inteesting
its
a
bit
hard
to
describe
but
it
was
very
mild
intruiging
but
not
in
your
face
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
halfaliter
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
apricot
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
dies
down
quickly
there
is
just
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
some
red
grape
and
cherry
a
hint
of
oak
it
fills
the
nose
fairly
well
the
taste
is
also
on
the
sweet
and
malty
side
more
cherry
and
wood
in
there
very
earthy
in
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
really
good
a
unique
style
of
beer
that
should
be
brewed
by
more
people

quarters

the
rest
maltiness
and
toasted

and
a

waft

hops
greet
the
nose
earthy
notes
are
underlying
a

after
the

the
taste
is
hearty
german

the

this
brew
begs
to
be
drunk
but
i
try
to
savour
it
keller
biers
are
an
under
rated
style
imho
im
enjoying
them
more
and
more
lately
as
a
changeup
from
the
usual
this
will
be
one
i
will
pick
up
again
and
again
good
beer
a
fruity
bitterness
and
a
light
acidity
in
the
back
this
beer
is
a
dark
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
a
dense
cream
colored
head
the
head
doesnt
last
particularly
long
and
leaves
only
little
lace
the
aroma
is
sweet
floral
herbal
and
slightly
yeasty
its
grainy
grassy
and
rustic
the
taste
is
full
of
sweet
toasted
malt
and
citrusy
hops
low
carbonation
medium
body
and
satisfactory
balanced
finish
is
only
slightly
sweet
and
very
soft
the
taste
seems
roughhewn
its
good
but
not
clean
overall
though
this
is
a
very
satisfying
beer
i
think
that
this
may
be
the
first
time
ive
had
this
style
a
lovely
dark
brown
brew
with
a
small
head
of
foam
aromas
are
of
juicy
fruity
hops
and
nice
lightly
bready
backing
malts
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
and
very
reminiscent
of
youngs
bitter
or
something
similar
the
mouthfeel
is
very
casklike
in
its
smooth
rolling
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
an
interesting
style
that
i
like
very
much
lack
of
carbonation
detracted
from
enjoyment
in
the
mouth
somewhat
astringent
note
leaves
a
somewhat
unpleasant
aftertaste
detracting
from
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
average
not
too
thin
and
i
think
appropriate
for
this
beer
all
in
all
a
very
refreshing
and
different
beer
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
no
carbonation
my
first
kellerzwickel
bier
i
think
its
quite
interesting
and
tasty
i
wanna
drink
more
boggy
amber
the
floating
sediment
is
welldistributed
and
interesting
to
observe
nose
of
parsley
pretzels
dripping
in
clover
honey
arranged
beautifully
across
a
freshly
kilned
terra
cotta
platter
ohhh
so
smooth
and
balanced
and
bursting
with
a
lingering
natural
hop
flavor
to
finish
like
licking
on
a
limestone
lollipop
i
reckon
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
drinkability
hrrm
this
is
not
bad
at
all
that
much
ill
admit
my
first
and
only
kellerbier
so
i
cant
say
whether
i
dislike
the
style
or
whether
this
isnt
a
great
example
of
one
an
experience
i
dont
regret
though
while
i
wish
more
zwickel
biers
were
available
around
here
this
one
is
just
not
up
to
snuff
bready
dough
aromas
with
hints
of
musty
earth
and
dirt
malty
grapeskin
flavor
leads
to
just
the
most
mild
tartness
just
slightly
astringent
in
a
pleasant
way
astringency
leads
to
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
light
hopping
provides
balance
wellcrafted
very
balanced
and
supremely
easy
to
drink
this
sure
was
something
i
hadnt
seen
much
of
if
everan
unfiltered
pilsner
i
thought
the
pour
was
nice
dark
goldcopper
color
and
fairly
cloudynice
well
retained
blooming
head
aroma
of
a
good
pilsner
malty
and
somewhat
minerally
and
fresh
well
balanced
pilsner
the
hops
are
very
presentfirst
time
trying
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
pours
out
an
extremely
hazy
amberishcopper
color
a
creamy
white
head
that
sticks
and
leaves
minimal
lace
on
the
glass
extremely
aromatic
big
nose
of
toasty
malts
and
floral
hops
with
hints
of
musty
fruitiness
quite
complex
and
rich
in
taste
very
earthy
bready
and
toasted
caramel
malts
and
hints
of
woodiness
buttery
a
bit
tart
with
hints
of
sourness
too
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
the
flavors
all
melt
together
quite
nicely
with
a
light
touch
of
crispness
in
the
finish
i
suspect
from
the
hopping
a
warming
alcohol
presence
sort
of
sneaks
up
in
the
end
too
balanced
with
a
spicy
undertone
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
odd
but
quite
nice
brew
strange
belgian
qualities
for
a
german
pilsener
but
apparently
keller
bier
is
a
style
unto
itself
i
really
liked
it
but
could
see
where
some
might
be
put
off
by
it
expecting
a
more
traditional
german
pils
it
has
a
lot
of
citrus
in
the
flavor
you
are
first
hit
with
orange
peels
and
some
lemon
then
a
nice
spicy
blend
of
hops
comes
into
the
mix
this
is
very
intersting
for
a
german
pils
because
it
is
not
dominated
by
malts
and
it
has
that
very
interesting
citrus
flavor
it
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
mild
but
sufficient
carbonation
it
is
very
complex
with
a
pretty
light
body
and
it
is
a
very
good
drinker
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
was
of
a
copper
yellow
with
a
creamy
foam
the
smell
was
of
a
citrus
sort
with
a
hint
of
hops
but
when
i
tasted
it
i
flinched
at
the
sour
taste
that
followed
it
was
so
bad
that
it
was
one
of
the
few
times
that
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
without
taking
a
second
sip
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
all
time
low
beers
that
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
dark
gold
to
copper
in
color
head
seems
to
go
away
fairly
quickly
i
notice
some
caramel
taste
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
i
get
a
little
taste
of
hops
this
beer
actually
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
pennsylvania
brewing
oktoberfest
that
i
picked
up
i
thought
it
was
ok
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
of
beer
i
think
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
in
this
style
of
beer
cloudy
bronze
great
head
retention
a
smell
that
is
both
earthy
and
fruity
with
notes
of
sedimentary
rock
autumn
leaves
fresh
rye
bread
sans
caraway
and
dried
fruit
round
supple
velvety
and
completely
dry
it
is
the
absolute
definition
of
seamless
the
integration
of
flavor
is
like
no
other
beer
while
it
may
be
possible
to
unpack
all
of
the
ingredients
roasted
malt
hops
etc
they
are
stitched
together
in
such
a
beautiful
and
natural
whole
why
would
you
want
to
this
is
a
great
beer
the
result
of
great
ingredients
and
insane
patience
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
pilsner
its
falls
way
beyond
the
style
guidelines
all
around
taste
it
as
a
beer
in
itself
the
copper
hued
brew
is
effervescently
bubbly
and
has
a
bit
of
an
ale
like
haze
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
candy
like
sweetness
w
notes
of
honey
lightly
fruity
yeast
esters
are
perceptible
as
well
and
certainly
are
odd
for
a
pilsner
caramel
malt
sweetness
is
there
as
well
in
aroma
thus
making
the
overall
aroma
odd
yet
enjoyable
any
hop
nose
is
overpowered
by
the
sweet
malt
notes
flavorwise
this
brew
has
more
caramel
malt
sweetness
than
any
other
lager
ive
tasted
and
initally
is
quite
sweet
but
hop
bitterness
asserts
itself
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
and
lingers
sufficiently
to
provide
for
a
pleasantly
bittersweet
finish
this
keller
beer
is
an
odd
brew
although
flavorful
and
certainly
unique
theres
an
overall
lack
of
balance
my
palette
is
left
confused
its
defintely
worth
a
taste
however

bit
too
raw
for
me
i
know
is
it
an
old
style
that
does
not
want
to
change
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
sit
down
with
that
often
given
the
choice
165
pours
a
slightly
foggy
amber
or
bronze
color
i
believe
this
is
my
first
keller
bier
if
that
is
actually
a
style
with
in
itself
slightly
malted
on
the
nose
as
well
as
some
fruit
aromas
the
taste
is
just
excellent
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bite
with
a
nice
malt
backdrop
and
nice
fruit
flavors
green
apples
i
think
stood
out
all
that
and
more
can
be
tasted
on
the
palate
balanced
very
well
i
agree
with
thrasher
i
would
kill
to
try
other
keller
type
beersoverall
an
excellent
brew
cloudy
amber
lager
with
ample
head
not
sure
if
this
is
a
pilsener
in
fact
i
think
keller
should
be
its
own
category
although
i
suppose
it
could
also
be
considered
an
unfiltered
pilsner
this
bottled
sample
is
slightly
damaged
either
from
age
or
travel
otherwise
it
would
get
5s
on
taste
from
me
this
is
a
terrific
beer
full
and
malty
in
the
mouth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
prickliness
roasty
apple
and
whole
grain
oatmeal
bread
flavor
simple
clean
finish
a
great
all
around
beer
would
kill
to
try
other
keller
type
beers
to
me
its
more
satisfying
and
versatile
than
a
pilsner
this
beer
does
not
taste
like
your
typical
german
bright
golden
in
color
nice
nose
of
hopsand
suprising
hops
in
the
taste
definatly
liked
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
one
of
the
most
unique
and
flavourful
beers
i
have
yet
to
try
certainly
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
lagers
a
god
brew
all
bow
and
pay
homage
overall
why
is
this
brew
so
good
for
some
reason
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
love
it
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
and
it
really
isnt
very
filling
its
just
a
generally
good
beer
and
the
wife
loves
it
o
although
very
light
and
mainly
dominated
by
yeasty
and
citrusy
flavours
something
im
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
something
about
this
beer
was
really
enjoyable
it
has
such
a
crisp
summery
feel
to
it
that
it
feels
like
you
can
drink
it
anytime

was
purchased
at
a
centerparcs
in
germany
and
for
a
bit
under
2
euros
id
say
its
quite
a
steal
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
today
i
went
to
the
speciality
beer
shop
in
berlin
and
i
decided
to
buy
8
or
so
beers
with
the
only
criteria
that
each
cost
more
than
e2
00ltr
or
e1
00
for
a
standard
12l
bottle
this
approach
probably
weeds
out
8090
of
the
multitude
of
offerings
so
tonight
ive
had
a
cracking
couple
of
beers
but
i
hate
to
say
it
this
one
is
doing
very
little
for
me
indeed
despite
its
price
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
beer
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
i
would
try
it
again
probably
not
something
id
buy
again
but
not
bad
at
all
and
totally
drinkable
taste
is
a
light
and
has
a
raw
malt
smell
some
straw
and
floury
notes
the
beer
has
yeast
in
it
and
that
comes
through
in
the
taste
a
fleshy
taste
light
but
really
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
believe
that
its
a
genuine
fresh
product
as
the
label
claims
the
brewer
hasnt
pushed
any
boats
out
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
kellerbier
gotta
hand
it
to
off
color
for
brewing
up
a
style
that
most
brewers
completely
ignore
this
stuff
pours
a
partly
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
grain
sweetgrass
mild
greens
and
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
flowery
grassiness
taking
full
root
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
fluid
feel
overall
a
solid
zwickel
something
easy
to
drink
and
unprepossessing
not
bad
at
all
tasted
from
draft
at
firkin
on
february
27
2015
bready
light
and
well
balanced
nicely
carbed
blonde
zwickel
with
some
hints
of
spice
tangy
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
this
seems
really
lightweight
at
first
but
it
grows
into
an
aromatic
pleasant
taste
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
new
seasons
market
in
portland
overall
its
a
little
bit
piquant
for
the
style
but
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
a
pilsner
style
beer
with
a
complexity
that
takes
it
beyond
what
youd
usually
experience
with
pilsner
type
brews
its
got
a
mix
of
hoppiness
and
grassy
flavors
that
keep
it
interesting
through
a
session
kudos
to
ecliptic
for
being
willing
to
reach
out
a
little
from
the
norm
not
as
yeasty
as
a
german
version
certainly
happier
a
nice
beer
a
great
alternative
to
ales
upon
boring
ales
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
wheat
pilsner
hops
hint
of
sulfur
and
toffee
unusual
but
good
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
mild
citrus
grassy
haylike
hops
finishing
with
grassy
hops
bitterness
and
biscuit
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
nice
little
hybrid
between
wheat
and
pilsner
beers
and
not
a
bad
representative
of
a
kellerbier
which
is
not
a
common
style
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
understated
at
first
but
the
long
lingering
finish
is
a
nice
balance
of
dry
haylike
and
biscuit
flavors
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
nicely
balanced
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
more
than
i
expected
to
i
would
consider
this
for
a
hot
summer
day
session
ale
with
good
offbeat
flavors
overall
its
not
bad
but
an
ok
keller
overall
a
really
clean
and
quaffable
summer
brew
a
little
lacking
in
depth
to
make
it
a
regular
but
much
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
bottled
i
could
see
this
being
my
goto
beer
for
neighborhood
barbecues
maybe
its
just
the
style
but
this
this
one
doesnt
stick
out
to
me
the
first
sip
reminded
me
of
yuengling
lager
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
but
not
something
i
would
regularly
buy
im
not
going
to
turn
it
down
during
the
warm
summer
months
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
though
a
great
summer
beer
and
another
great
one
from
this
brewery
this
beer
pours
with
about
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
despite
the
unfiltered
nature
of
the
brew
there
is
little
cloudiness
i
will
swirl
the
next
one
i
know
i
can
get
those
tasty
yeasts
to
comply
in
the
aroma
you
get
lots
of
grain
and
bread
almost
crackerlike
the
flavor
comes
off
as
largely
the
same
as
the
aroma
very
bready
almost
like
taking
a
fist
full
of
pale
pilsner
malt
in
your
mouth
this
keller
bier
is
definitely
infinitely
tastier
i
am
certain
although
the
complexity
is
nothing
like
something
with
various
adjuncts
and
a
major
abv
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
really
fits
the
bill
when
you
want
to
have
a
few
beers
without
feeling
too
bloated
or
drunk
o
damn
tasty
only
picked
up
a
single
and
really
wish
i
had
more
light
in
alcohol
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
or
for
anytime
you
want
a
nice
flavorful
beer
that
isnt
going
to
wreck
your
taste
buds
or
sobriety
this
is
only
my
second
kellerzwickel
and
i
will
definitely
seek
out
more
i
think
this
edges
out
fat
heads
example
by
being
slightly
more
complex
will
buy
again
for
sure
and
hope
i
can
score
some
more
before
its
gone
for
the
year
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
summerits
somewhat
malty
but
still
easy
to
drink
on
draft
at
woodlands
tavern
in
columbus
pour
was
a
super
cloudy
light
straw
with
a
tight
white
head
the
smell
is
loaded
with
a
sweet
light
graininess
and
no
bitterness
whatsoever
the
taste
is
super
drinkable
with
the
taste
dominated
by
corn
and
grain
i
love
this
german
beer
from
what
ive
learned
is
on
of
the
better
small
breweries
in
oh
overall
a
summer
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
character
tasty
well
made
actually
almost
like
a
high
quality
import
lager
a
beer
like
this
is
always
welcome
in
the
beer
fridge
a
nice
summer
lager
i
could
see
hitting
this
a
few
times
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
is
not
hurt
at
all
by
serving
it
ice
cold
still
retaining
all
the
taste
and
feel
it
has
as
it
warms
another
quality
beer
from
columbus
brewing
company
o
this
is
a
wonderful
session
lager
for
the
summer
so
drinkable
amazing
mouthfeel
and
some
really
nice
flavor
pours
a
semi
clouded
yellow
golden
color
with
massive
white
head
flowing
thick
big
chunky
head
at
that
with
velvet
smooth
texture
lacing
is
scattered
nice
and
random
around
my
big
oversized
glass
aroma
has
lemon
essence
with
biscuit
dough
rising
in
the
morning
kitchen
flavorwise
its
a
beautiful
thing
fresh
with
biscuit
dough
bread
lightly
toasted
malt
sweetness
ample
german
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
leaving
a
semi
dry
finish
perfect
summer
beer
these
guys
from
columbus
brewing
are
dead
on
mouthfeel
is
light
ample
lively
carbonation
jumps
off
the
palate
and
into
my
senses
amazing
flowing
beer
with
enough
girth
from
yeast
sediment
to
truly
fulfill
your
thirst
and
hunger
overall
intense
simple
complexity
to
breed
drinkability
if
that
makes
sense
summer
teeth
is
a
nice
kellerbier
its
not
a
style
that
features
a
ton
of
pizzazz
but
this
is
a
nice
release
its
pretty
straight
forward
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
who
am
i
to
argue
with
such
a
combo
try
a
bottle
or
two
and
see
for
yourselfits
good
stuff
very
nice
summer
brew
perfect
for
outdoors
activities
another
well
made
brew
from
columbus
brewing
summer
teeth
is
simply
extraordinary
highly
recommended
im
very
impressed
its
one
of
those
lagers
that
opens
your
eyes
and
let
you
know
theres
some
really
interesting
ones
out
there
really
really
nice
beer
right
here
overall
quite
a
tasty
brew
i
can
definitely
see
this
being
a
summer
goto
seems
like
it
would
be
superb
on
a
hot
day
another
fine
beer
from
the
folks
at
cbc
while
im
fairly
new
to
the
style
this
is
simply
a
wellconstructed
beer
looks
like
hay
color
with
a
small
cap
of
white
that
seriously
stayed
for
about
a
few
seconds
with
no
visible
carbonation
aroma
is
earthy
musky
grain
touches
of
light
grass
but
really
rather
bland
and
without
much
in
the
way
of
any
depth
light
feel
watery
at
times
without
any
really
big
flavors
or
huge
noticeable
chnage
from
the
smell
clean
finish
with
little
aftertaste
left
not
much
on
the
palate
m
light
bodied
but
with
a
nice
bit
of
crispness
o
a
nice
crisp
lager
for
the
summer
time
a
nice
switch
from
the
usual
american
pale
wheat
summer
beers
that
flood
the
shelves
at
this
time
of
year
o
pretty
descent
summer
beer
o
very
enjoyable
great
summer
beer
o
refreshing
summer
beer
i
can
see
this
as
a
beer
that
would
attract
a
lot
of
attention
when
the
temps
start
rising
o
a
nice
summer
lager
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
its
only
fault
is
the
dryness
12
ounce
bottle
2011
batch
with
new
label
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
grainy
wheat
and
sweet
malt
citrusy
hops
lemon
peel
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
mostly
like
grainwheatbready
malt
and
some
citrusy
hops
lemon
peel
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
nice
refreshing
brew
a
good
choice
for
summertime
i
cant
believe
i
havent
tried
this
before
i
might
have
to
pick
up
some
of
this
over
the
summer
definitely
worth
a
try
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
perfect
craft
beer
for
a
bmc
drinker
and
a
good
beer
for
a
ba
looking
for
a
nice
summer
brew
di
enjoyed
the
one
i
had
probably
would
and
did
switch
it
up
after
one
but
could
easily
go
right
back
for
another
not
my
top
style
of
beer
but
i
was
at
cbc
last
night
and
wanted
to
try
it
on
draft
i
was
pleased
overall
impression
ryan
feel
free
to
keep
the
cbc
express
rolling
my
way
these
guys
know
their
way
around
a
brew
kettle
mouthfeel
is
great
super
carbonated
crisp
clean
goes
down
easily
drinkability
is
super
high
too
i
dont
see
myself
wanting
more
of
this
any
time
soon
but
were
it
offered
to
me
i
could
likely
drink
a
6pack
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
out
throwing
the
horseshoes
went
down
nicelyglad
to
of
tried
this
brew
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
guinness
style
glass
d
a
very
good
summer
lager
anyone
could
pick
this
up
and
be
able
to
enjoy
it
it
is
clean
and
crisp
but
the
intense
dryness
doesnt
make
it
an
overly
thirst
quenching
one
great
amount
of
carbonation
light
bodied
and
nice
and
crisp
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
and
is
definitely
something
i
will
buy
again
would
work
great
at
a
cookout
and
definitely
something
i
would
say
is
sessionable
another
good
brew
from
columbus
brewing
drinkability
sessionable
if
it
wasnt
for
the
taste
d
quite
quaffable
with
a
nice
flavor
while
im
not
really
familiar
with
the
beer
style
this
may
be
my
new
go
to
summer
beer
fantastic
combo
of
smoothness
body
sweetness
and
bitterness
home
run
for
columbus
brewing
company
this
could
truly
be
their
crossover
hit
to
the
macro
crowd
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
decanted
into
a
pint
glass
its
a
pale
golden
color
small
white
head
definitely
a
summer
lager
smells
cool
bready
touch
of
honey
and
grains
not
terribly
strong
taste
is
pretty
clean
bready
little
bit
of
honey
slight
hop
bitterness
toward
the
end
light
mouthfeel
very
appropriate
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
all
the
summer
foods
the
crack
was
loud
and
i
was
excited
to
initiate

overall
a

slightly
buttery
feel
overall
i
nice
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
kellerbiers
are
a
rarely
seen
style
taste
similar
to
a
helles
lager
o
a
cool
twist
on
the
standard
pilsener
its
different
and
the
unfiltered
part
of
this
thing
is
obvious
my
first
few
impressions
are
very
good
i
can
see
this
growing
on
me
the
hop
character
reminds
me
of
hans
pils
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
having
more
well
done
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
seasonal
release
that
hasnt
returned
since
spring
2013
i
miss
it
dearly
not
one
of
sams
best
this
is
notably
good
beer
for
a
sam
adams
product
i
expected
something
a
little
more
memorable
this
was
good
and
certainly
has
a
time
and
a
place
but
it
was
largely
vacant
the
temperature
with
which
it
was
served
was
a
little
warmer
than
i
prefer
maybe
45f
and
that
may
have
affected
the
overall
expectation
however
what
struck
me
most
was
the
lack
of
zest
in
the
body
and
bitterness
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
as
a
very
light
refreshing
alternative
id
imagine
obtained
a
bottle
from
a
pick
six
craft
beer
wall
here
in
calgary
this
beer
certainly
looks
like
it
diverges
from
other
members
of
the
lager
clan
a
murky
peach
color
with
a
few
inches
of
white
head
one
is
immediately
struck
by
the
yeasty
spicy
nose
smells
like
bakery
shop
yeast
bready
but
with
some
peppery
spice
and
green
herb
that
perhaps
recalls
celery
you
can
discern
some
sweetness
as
well
perhaps
stone
fruit
and
mild
citrus
palate
reflects
all
these
components
and
this
beer
is
something
of
a
mishmash
the
aforementioned
yeast
jumps
out
first
followed
by
sourdough
bread
honey
sweet
malt
weedy
green
hops
that
recall
fresh
grass
hints
of
unripe
apple
and
quince
subtle
orange
and
lemon
citrus
vitamin
tablets
and
something
else
herbal
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
licorice
eventually
these
malty
and
fresh
zesty
flavors
give
way
and
things
become
sweeter
bringing
the
stone
fruit
from
the
aroma
back
to
mind
plenty
fizzy
and
this
serves
to
amplify
the
overall
sour
fruity
and
yeasty
vibe
than
i
can
only
assume
is
unique
to
lagers
that
have
not
been
purged
of
yeast
remnants
alcohol
is
detectable
hops
were
not
as
assertive
as
the
label
suggests
hopped
with
tettnang
but
there
certainly
is
a
citrus
node
in
the
flavor
matrix
medium
bodied
with
a
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
the
total
package
is
crisp
and
dry
enough
to
pass
muster
as
a
pilsener
family
member
but
with
considerable
residual
sweetness
and
more
fruit
elements
id
enjoy
this
in
greater
quantities
as
a
warmweather
sessional
o
great
drinkability
smoothing
ans
refreshing
another
great
samuel
adams
beer
this
beer
was
served
way
too
cold
which
given
the
location
was
not
completely
unexpected
still
this
is
fairly
enjoyable
and
definitely
serviceably
quaffable
it
definitely
gets
more
flavorful
and
complex
as
it
warms
up
from
frigid
initial
serving
temperature
remarks
not
bad
overall
and
probably
a
good
session
beer
for
cooler
months

the

from
sam
adams
and
i
dont
typically
care
for
lagers
but
this
was
pretty
good
not
as
aggressive
as
an
ale
its
fairly
fullflavored
pours
a
pretty
honey

cloudy
with
great
retention
and
lacing
really
engages

eye

in

cracker
and
lots
of
doughy
malt
hops
come
back
to
the
nose
with
some
sweet
citrus
as
it
warms
and
a
little
earth
opens
up
with
orange
and
lemon
the
taste
is
grassy
hops
the
tart

in
back
of
the
hay
and

and
hardy
with
toasted
grains
and
doughy
breaddy
malt
its
lightly
dry
soft
and
pleasant
enough
but
while
it
drinks
friendly
it
is
a
little
bland
it
doesnt
really
linger
and
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
mix
of
styles
looks
like
a
belgian
smells
like
a
lager
drinks
like
a
bit
heavy
pils
nothing
really
stands
out
as
excellent
but
it
is
rich
and
smooth
low
alcohol
content
and
if
you
like
malt
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
just
the
way
we
like
it
jim
kocj
strikes
again
the
rest
a
very
strong
offering
from
sa
more
body
than
i
was
expecting
and
great
balance
that
kept
me
wanting
more
of
this
one
very
solid
o
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
if
this
one
tastes
similar
to
a
wit
but
a
few
other
random
flavors
just
seems
to
set
it
off
a
bit
overall
if
i
had
a
blindfold
on
i
would
have
pegged
this
as
an
american
take
on
a
wit
too
sweet
and
not
enough
tang
to
make
the
style
work
as
it
is
i
have
no
idea
what
the
brewers
are
going
for
beyond
the
combination
of
a
bock
lager
and
kellerbier
and
why
is
that
a
worthwhile
combo
o
the
sulfur
quality
is
pretty
strong
with
a
most
of
the
hops
flavor
just
being
bitterness
and
not
much

the
taste
is
interesting

complex

it
shows
that
the

can
add
to

enhance
a

often

see

too
many
overhopped

im
not

what
i
expected
but
this
didnt
hit
the
spot
this

isnt
in
my
wheelhouse
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
od
a
pretty
decent
take
on
the
style
definitely
not
breaking
new
ground
but
its
got
a
solid
flavour
not
overly
drinkable
though
as
the
flavour
doesnt
really
hold
your
attention

taste
is
primarily
malty
with
bready

balanced
out
against

it

its
obvious
it
was
well
made

has
some
slight

is

quite

and
a

you
out

it
is
still
a

with
good

is
very
slightly
dry
very
refreshing
has
a
nice
lemony

overall
a
tasty
beer
that
requires
me
to
have
another
o
overall
this
is
pretty
good
no
complaints
affordable
too
recommended
by
me
o
a
nicely
full
round
lager
aroma
augmented
with
lots
of
yeasty
bready
character
as
a
result
of
being
unfiltered
nicely
hopped
as
well
drinks
well
i
usually
drink
this
on
tap
but
have
been
known
to
grab
the
occasional
sixpack
o
not
my
thing
i
guess
i
enjoy
the
sierra
nevada
kellerwies
quite
a
bit
but
this
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
o
an
alright
beer
seems
fairly
consistent
with
the
style
profile
i
have
greatly
enjoyed
samuel
adams
alpine
spring
o
oh
well
at
least
i
get
to
tick
a
brand
new
style
this
is
an
average
keller
it
would
be
nice
on
a
warm
spring
day
as
an
easily
drinkable
session
brew
but
nothing
really
stands
out
not
a
bad
offering
from
sa
but
there
are
others
of
a
similar
style
i
would
choose
would
prefer
a
stronger
hop
flavor
meh
a
very
average
beer
its
drinkable
and
its
not
bad
but
theres
nothing
to
make
me
want
to
really
have
another
regardless
i
would
have
another
to
see
how
it
tastes
when
im
not
a
little
stuffed
up
a
respectable
seasonal
i
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
unless
it
was
the
only
thing
between
me
and
a
mgd
not
bad
certainly
drinkable
but
not
the
most
exciting
beer
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
fans
of
wheat
beers
since
is
has
a
bit
of
that
styles
coriander
and
banana
sweetness
great
on
its
own
but
going
well
with
light
pork
and
salad
dishes
cheers
final
thoughts
if
you
like
the
combination
of
butter
and
citrus
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
im
actually
surprised
because
samuel
adams
usually
has
pretty
solid
seasonals
would
i
drink
it
again
not
without
some
persuasion
overall
i
found
this
beer
tastely
but
kinda
unremarkable
i
would
def
get
it
again
as
i
did
like
it
a
lot
there
was
nothing
excepting
the
crispness
that
i
found
stood
out
for
me
this
might
have
tasted
better
to
me
than
it
really
is
because
i
had
it
on
the
first
day
of
spring
while
looking
out
over
a
snow
covered
land
but
it
did
invoke
a
fresh
taste
that
was
enjoyable
and
made
me
dream
of
daffodils
and
dogwood
blossoms
that
are
soon
to
arrive
golden
and
hazy
small
but
tightly
formed
white
head
the
head
looks
like

note
joined
shortly
after
by
a

note
a
grainy
note
persists
in
the
finish
alongside
very
gentle
bitterness
almost
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
smooth
and
a
little
bit
creamy
on
the
palate
good
beer
but
i
prefer
the
bolder
noble
pils
with
noble
pils
not
being
available
this
year
in
ontario
i
would
consider
buying
this
again
overall
a
great
beer
ive
bought
this
a
few
times
now
and
will
buy
again
o
my
best
experience
with
a
sa
brew
so
far
eh
had
higher
hopes
for
this
one
pours
mostly
clear
even
though
its
said
to
be
unfiltered
really
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
very
nice
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
hoppy
lemony
and
light
with
a
lighter
grain
makeup
as
well
maybe
some
wheat
in
here
and
plenty
of
pale
and
crystal
malt
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
than
the
nose
and
therefore
the
hops
dont
really
get
big
until
the
finish
which
is
clean
and
fresh
brisk
like
early
spring
itself
it
also
has
a
minerally
character
elemental
not
metallic
but
off
just
a
bit
its
super
easy
drinking
light
and
interesting
enough
with
really
bright
carbonation
and
a
less
than
medium
body
it
does
get
a
little
filling
after
a
few
though
which
is
sort
of
odd
but
this
is
a
decent
choice
for
the
spring
box
if
i
reach
into
the
box
blind
and
grab
one
of
these
im
not
disappointed
although
i
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
that
flows
easily
around
the
palate
o
a
very
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
great
beer
for
that
midpoint
between
winter
and
spring

thinner

with

to
help
it
a

overall
better
than
i
remember
it
being
and
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
m
tastes
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
that
is
then
overtaken
by
sourness
a
very
solid
seasonal
from
samuel
adams
crisp
and
refreshing
and
a
mostly
worthy
replacement
for
noble
pils
worth
checking
out
ill
definitely
be
putting
this
with
some
burgers
from
the
grill
soon
i
poured
this
brewski
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
cloudy
unfiltered
kinda
orange
looking
with
a
kinda
orange
looking
head
the
head
also
did
not
last
very
long
the
beer
had
a
indescribable
smell
sorry
the
beer
was
carbonatedly
tasting
and
had
a
hint
of
orange
peel
taste
slightly
bitter
finish
and
decent
lacing
might
be
a
good
summertime
beer
i
will
try
again
cause
im
really
not
sure
if
i
liked
it
or
not
easily
one
of
my
top
3
favorite
beers
beautiful
beer
from
start
to
finish
nice
pour
collects
a
little
and
i
mean
little
sediment
in
the
bottle
if
the
course
of
a
few
days
in
the
fridge
but
didnt
effect
tasting
i
cant
think
of
much
that
could
be
done
to
improve
this
aside
from
moving
it
out
of
the
seasonal
catagory
and
over
to
yearround
brewmasters
collection
summary
this
was
surprisingly
tasty
i
liked
the
wheatlike
lightness
of
it
combined
with
a
little
hop
bite
at
the
beginning
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
will
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
excellent
beer
pretty
well
balanced
but
leaning
towards
the
sweet
side
o
nice
but
ultimately
a
bit
forgettable
nothing
is
really
standing
out
not
a
bad
brew
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
smallish
offwhite

quickly
settled
to

brings

sweet
that
controlled
by

carbonic

and
a

bitter
despite
that
tang
carbonation
seems
a
bit
tame
with
good
body
finish
is
like
flavor
and
fairly
long

very
nice

well

with
good

and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
pretty
good
seasonal
brew
similar
to
theri
ol
summer
ale
except
has
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
kick
pretty
good
and
refreshing
beer
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
again
from
a
single
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
trader
joes
im
going
for
the
sam
adams
spring
12pack
for
some
more
of
this
o
sam
adams
has
a
nice
brew
here
it
has
a
nice
balanced
flavor
and
a
surprisingly
good
mouthfeel
for
a
lighter
beer
the
name
is
alpine
spring
but
i
could
easily
sit
out
on
my
deck
in
the
summer
and
quaff
this
one
a
good
choice
if
you
want
something
that
has
some
nice
flavor
but
will
also
quench
your
thirst
the
only
thing
i
still
cant
get
over
is
why
every
year
sam
adams
retires
its
winter
lager
and
puts
out
its
spring
brew
in
the
middle
of
january
wheat
beers
can
get
a
little
boring
or
heavy
during
the
summer
so
this
beer
would
be
a
tasty
light
beer
to
drink
there
are
a
ton
of
different
very
subtle
flavors
in
this
beer
which
is
pretty
amazing
for
a
light
beer
from
the
largest
craft
brewery
in
the
country
there
is
citrus
balanced
perfectly
with
the
hop
bitterness
then
the
beer
is
unfiltered
so
it
has
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
to
it
and
a
bit
of
fruity
flavor
similar
to
wheat
beers
will
definitely
buy
it
again
and
try
to
stock
up
in
case
they
stop
selling
it
in
the
summer
overall
decent
beer
for
the
price
especially
if
going
to
a
store
with
limited
options
weve
heard
this
is
awesome
on
draught
so
we
look
forward
to
reviewing
it
again
very
cloudy
appearance
with
a
pale
golden
color
made
this
look
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
except
for
the
head
which
was
much
smaller
the
smell
was
quite
floral
and
lemony
and
very
inviting
the
taste
started
tart
and
bready
and
finished
powdery
and
dry
the
hop
bitterness
was
barely
there
the
body
felt
light
and
quenching
simple
in
construction
but
quenching
this
is
like
potato
chips
in
beer
form
once
you
start
you
will
not
notice
ho
fast
you
are
consuming
it
and
once
its
gone
you
immediately
feel
the
need
to
grab
another
o
this
brew
is
very
mediocre
nothing
too
exciting
o
when
i
had
this
last
year
i
thought
it
was
completely
awful
now
i
find
it
perfectly
average
not
bad
not
great
workable
in
a
pinch
but
not
worth
seeking
out
if
anything
represents
the
c
average
to
a
t
its
this
and
fat
tire
o
i
was
impressed
it
was
definately
a
different
beer
wasnt
overly
complex
but
was
very
easy
drinking
and
had
some
smells
and
tastes
that
one
doent
normally
encounter
pours
a
golden
and
hazy
orange
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
thin
head
left
some
decent
lacing
at
first
that
disappeared
over
the
course
of
the
drink
smells
of
stale
lemons
grassy
and
wheat
crisp
and
clean
hop
bill
up
front
followed
by
some
malty
chewiness
and
finishes
with
a
lemon
zest
sour
citrus
smack
this
is
a
medium
to
full
body
but
has
a
relatively
sour
feel
to
it
that
i
cant
undo
other
than
the
sourness
it
is
highly
drinkable
but
i
would
go
on
to
the
next
one
before
trying
this
one
a
second

12oz
bottle
hazed
copper
with
a
stiff
lightly
offwhite
head
sudsy
lacing
that
sticks
smells
tangy
with
citrus
and
bread
flavors
that
are
wrapped
up
in
a
earthy
and
floral
blanket
the
taste
has
a
tight
bitterness
with
notes
of
fresh
citrus
including
a
little
zesty
lemon
and
orange
bready
malt
mixes
in
along
back

gives
this
a
strong
twang
across
the
back
dry
and
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
firm
and
crisp
bite
that
gets
a
little
softer
underneath
this
is
easy
drinking
stuff
with
the
sweetness
of
a
lighter
bock
beer
but
then
a
crisp
citric
presence
that
really
gave
this
a
nice
snap
in
the
mouth
as
well
decent
stuff
sam
adams
continues
to
impress
me
lately
from
exciting
new
yearround
brews
to
really
great
seasonals
they
have
really
delivered
some
unique
beers
i
only
bought
a
single
of
alpine
spring
but
i
will
going
back
to
buy
a
sixpack
soon
this
is
a
spring
seasonal
ill
be
excited
for
each
year
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
i
personally
would
have
liked
a
little
less
yeast
and
a
little
more
hop
character
but
otherwise
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
tastes
very
fresh
and
that
is
a
good
thing
i
would
recommend
buying
this
in
a
place
that
has
good
temperature
control
because
that
is
likely
to
impact
a
beer
with
so
much
yeast
in
it
i
would
drink
this
again
honestly
i
was
thrown
off
by
the
alpine
spring
thing
where
it
brought
thoughts
of
deodorant
came
to
mind
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
the
beer
is
this
was
a
little
disappointing
for
me
in
the
taste
the
aroma
and
unfiltered
appearance
promised
a
slightly
more
complex
palate
than
what
i
got
but
hey
its
another
seasonal
notch
on
the
sam
adams
belt
i
guess
thats
all
that
seems
to
count
these
days
o
a
decent
beer
definitely
springy
the
mix
of
the
orange
with
the
spice
and
the
grassiness
is
actually
quite
pleasant
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
it
came
in
the
sampler
pack
so
whats
a
man
to
do
o
pretty
good
beer
refreshing
for
the
springtime
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
white
smell
is
not
very
powerful
sweet
with
some
malt
and
subtle
citrus
taste
starts
out
with
a
subtle
bitter
moves
to
a
mild
sweet
and
slight
citrus
the
malt
is
the
backbone
of
this
beer
a
nice
smooth
medium
light
beer
very
crisp
enjoyable
feel
overall
a
crisp
beer
with
minimum
flavor
worth
checking
out
overall
pretty
mediocre
from
sam
adams
disappointed
it
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
big
cloudy
frothy
head
and
good
lacing
it
smells
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
it
has
a
fairly
bland
taste
with
a
little
bitter
taste
on
the
back
end
it
has
a
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
i
was
not
too
surprised
by
this
beer
and
i
would
only
buy
it
as
part
of
a
mixed
pack
o
tasty
and
very
chuggable
goes
down
very
easy
really
well
balanced
but
also
not
really
distinctive
seems
to
be
missing
something
just
so
neutral
and
even
that
its
almost
bland
not
bland
as
in
flavorless
more
like
unremarkable
or
without
character
i
could
chug
a
bunch
of
this
but
id
never
miss
it
or
crave
it
could
really
take
it
or
leave
it
shrug
o
cant
get
into
this
style
of
beer
might
be
a
better
offering
to
revisit
in
90
degree
weather
drinkable
but
so
forgettable
o
i
liked
this
beer
especially
because
it
is
balanced
with
a
nice
bite
of
hops
i
get
sick
of
beers
that
are
only
sweet
and
do
not
have
any
bitter
hoppiness
sam
adams
beers
never
disappoint
they
may
not
be
the
most
complex
beers
but
they
are
always
tasty
and
the
price
is
right
o
too
similar
to
their
other
lighter
beers
and
this
isnt
even
a
wheat
man
samuel
adams

overall
this
is
a
nice
lager
and
does
carry
a
good
range
and
complexity
of
flavors
given
the
name
its
easy
to
see
drinking
this
on
a
mountainside
perhaps
in
a
ski
lodge
as
a
refreshing
flavorful
beverage
that
wont
get
you
hammered
before
the
next
run
the
beer
does
have
weak
points
especially
in
the
nose
and
the
flavors
as
a
whole
could
use
more
power
and
nuance
to
help
set
the
brew
apart
still
not
a
bad
offering
would
drink
again
overall
if
citrus
taste
is
your
thing
this
is
for
you
however
im
not
the
citrus
type
i
can
see
why
its
a
spring
seasonal
for
that
reason
citrus
floral
caramel
easy
to
drink
beer
oa
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
wasnt
too
excited
about
it
first
because
i
was
concerned
about
it
being
a
little
to
bitter
but
its
actually
well
balanced
you
get
the
nice
citrus
taste
but
it
finishes
sweet
which
gives
it
a
really
neat
balance
ill
definitely
be
drinking
another
one
of
these
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
this
is
a
keller
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
helles
but
the
unfiltered
style
gave
it
some
interesting
subtle
notes
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
overall
high
drinkability
very
nice
i
agree
with
what
the
label
says
can
be
great
in
cool
weather
or
in
mild
weather
has
a
great
taste
that
i
could
session
very
easily
by
a
fire
or
in
the
warm
sun
alright
it
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
foam
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
refreshing
hoppy
notes
of
citrus
and
pine
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
citrusy
with
a
strong
grassy
malt
finish
it
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
with
moderate
prickly
carbonation
it
isnt
an
overly
complex
brew
but
it
gets
the
job
done
serviceable
lager
at
the
jfk
sports
bar
big
head
deep
yellowlaceya
little
cheesy
and
aggressive
carbonation
ok
drinkability
reminds
me
of
the
premium
lagers
available
many
decades
ago
prebig
brewer
a
zwickel
not
as
good
as
the
creemore
version
alpine
spring
from
samuel
adams
pours
a
nice
lemony
gold
color
the
smell
is
hoppy
like
an
ipa
maybe
not
as
intense
with
a
lemony
citrus
freshness
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
its
hoppy
with
a
good
bit
of
lemon
really
fresh
tasting
the
hoppiness
isnt
too
bitter
either
which
makes
it
smooth
i
could
drink
lots
of
these
very
light
for
my
tastes
but
that
aside
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
smooth
and
well
balanced
with
a
fruity
tang
do
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
actually
since
this
debuted
its
probably
my
favorite
regular
sam
adams
seasonal
an
enjoyable
and
not
incredibly
complicated
crisp
lager
that
fits
the
winterspring
transition
well
i
think
they
hit
the
mark
for
what
they
were
aiming
for
good
on
tap
too
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
discernable
qualities
otherwise
maybe
the
wife
will
like
it
very
great
tasting
easy
on
the
palate
not
a
lingering
after
taste
would
be
great
with
dinner
or
just
a
nice
summer
night
or
winter
night
in
a
hot
tub
light
beer
good
aroma
would
buy
again
taste
good
straight
from
the
bottle
or
a
frosted
glass
alpine
spring
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
large
forthy
head
the
smell
has
alot
of
spices
and
hints
of
yeast
the
taste
is
overall
very
crisp
some
belgian
like
spices
come
through
and
there
is
a
rather
strong
yeast
taste
good
full
flavor
overall
i
am
not
very
experienced
with
this
style
but
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
no
flavors
were
overpowering
o
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
i
think
it
may
have
a
bit
more
specialty
grain
than
needed
if
they
toned
that
down
a
bit
the
hops
might
come
forward
and
nail
the
juiciness
that
i
think
would
work
perfectly
oa
nice
refreshing
lager
that
would
work
well
on
a
warm
day
but
still
hits
the
spot
as
i
drink
on
a
cold
cloudy
day
in
january
alpine
spring
is
simple
but
tasty
and
honeysweet
i
wouldnt
shell
out
for
it
in
its
own
12pack
but
it
makes
a
nice
team
player
here
in
the
spring
mix
pack
good
not
great
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
had
some
good
earthy
aromas
and
flavors
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
kick
in
the
hop
department
but
this
beer
is
still
pretty
cold
so
if
you
enjoy
after
letting
it
sit
for
about
30
minutes
flavor
and
aromas
should
enhance
that
much
more
very
sessionable
beer
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
like
it
its
a
good
beer
not
great
but
nothing
to
talk
bad
about
probably
not
something
to
talk
up
to
friends
either
another
good
beer
from
sam
adams
overall
i
suppose
its
worthy
of
the
ba
82
this
was
left
in
the
frig
from
the
6er
in
spring
wasnt
special
then
isnt
special
now
does
anybody
else
feel
all
the
sa
beers
use
the
same
hops
use
the
same
malts
or
are
they
just
getting
the
same
old
taste
from
the
stills
ive
honestly
never
been
a
fan
of
sa
but
given
them
many
opportiunities
this
one
is
just
another
sa
example
of
them
trying
to
market
yet
another
type
of
brew
i
couldnt
even
find
it
on
their
website
i
went
through
the
seasonal
collection
and
the
barrel
master
collection
but
just
gave
up
its
drinkable
they
all
are
but
nothing
really
special
youre
either
a
clone
who
praises
the
brewery
someone
who
cant
afford
the
bithigher
prices
and
doesnt
drink
it
or
someone
who
knows
its
just
a
gimmick
sorry
for
my
rant
thats
how
i
really
feel
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
worthy
of
the
company
i
like
most
of
their
beers
but
this
one
stands
out
a
little
above
the
pack
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
very
refreshing
i
feel
like
i
say
this
in
all
my
sam
adams
reviews
but
it
applies
again
nothing
spectacular
but
an
easydrinking
relatively
tasty
offering
you
could
certainly
do
a
lot
worse
o
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
warm
weather
beer
nice
compliment
with
my
fish
dinner
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
earthy
hop
presence
up
front
that
provides
a
decent
amount
of
dry
bitterness
which
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
dry
and
sticky
with
some
grassy
pine
needle
flavor
which
is
countered
by
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
notes
notably
mango
pineapple
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
hop
profile
is
more
complex
and
flavorful
than
the
nose
suggests
malt
presence
is
a
bit
stronger
than
expected
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
graham
cracker
but
it
doesnt
interfere
with
the
hop
flavor
too
much
decently
balanced
and
refreshing
nothing
extraordinary
but
pretty
solid
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
this
beer
is
just
okay
nothing
in
the
beer
that
speaks
to
the
beer
soul
goldish
yellow
in
color
with
white
head
not
a
good
taste
not
a
good
flavor
not
a
good
beer
rather
powerful
and
bitter
very
light
tasting
thin
beer
very
little
carbonation
actually
tasted
sour
possible
that
i
got
a
stale
beer
but
dobutful
this
beer
was
just
plain
bad
in
my
opinion
was
truly
hoping
for
more
overall
i
think
it
is
a
great
beer
to
set
the
tone
for
the
warmer
season
rolling
in
had
this
a
few
times
both
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
this
spring
guess
i
should
log
a
quick
review
another
nice
lager
from
sam
adams
bright
grassy
notes
lemon
lime
white
pepper
balanced
herbal
bitterness
against
some
clean
almost
honeysweet
malt
clean
and
grainy
light
sulfur
note
gives
a
more
authentic
feel
as
does
the
slightly
rustic
yeasty
haze
good
beer
love
the
return
to
lager
brewing
by
american
breweries
lately
and
sam
adams
seems
to
be
at
the
forefront
with
alpine
spring
and
the
excellent
nobel
pils
overall
this
beer
could
be
sessioned
quite
easily
sam
adams
tweaks
their
traditional
malted
flavor
here
and
provides
a
refreshing
approach
to
a
spring
seasonal
medium
bodied
and
brimming
with
citrus
an
overall
attractive
beer
seriously
tastes
like
somebody
rolled
up
a
fat
joint
of
sour
diesel
and
stuck
it
into
the
bottle
all
i
tasted
was
marijuana
while
i
was
drinking
this
that
and
some
slight
citrus
notes
wasnt
horrible
by
any
means
a
much
better
choice
than
some
beers
out
there
but
i
dont
smoke
pot
nor
do
i
enjoy
the
taste
of
it
within
my
beer
cant
really
recommend
this
to
very
many
people
as
most
probably
wouldnt
enjoy
it
and
i
do
not
understand
how
it
has
such
high
marks
d
very
drinkable
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
a
touch
thin
and
mild
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
custom
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
great
divide
brewing
company
goblet
pours
a
cloudy
light
copper
yellow
and
sunset
oranges
nose
is
bready
lagery
with
light
bitter
notes
pleasant
but
not
assertive
taste
is
rich
malty
but
not
maltforward
some
bitter
punctuations
bready
weisselike
without
the
bananas
mouthfeel
is
active
fizzy
complete
full
and
scrubbing
overall
again
like
a
weisse
beer
and
good
for
sure
but
prolly
wouldnt
buy
another
overall
it
is
worth
the
price
to
pick
it
up
for
9
or
10
bucks
a
six
pack
a
good
beer
overall
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangebeige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
herbal
floral
and
grassy
hop
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
nice
citrus
zest
flavor
that
comes
out
as
well
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
earthy
aromas
and
flavors
not
bad
bright
drinkable
tastes
like
spring
o
refreshing
sessionable
fullflavored
soild
id
buy
again
and
order
another
i
think
its
great
actually
it
reminds
me
of
a
great
cirque
du
soleil
show
where
there
is
just
so
much
great
stuff
happening
and
you
have
to
decide
what
to
concentrate
on
its
a
good
problem
to
have
the
term
meaning
unbunged
essentially
uncorked
indicates
that
the
beer
was
left
to
mature
in
an
openair
vessel
i
have
since
learned
that
spring
lager
is
not
entirely
made
this
way
its
tanks
are
controlled
by
a
pressure
valve
oreminiscent
of
noble
pils
just
unfiltered
a
touch
citrus
hop
with
a
little
more
malt
a
preferred
sam
adams
for
me
overall
this
wasnt
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
was
above
average
the
initial
experience
was
unremarkable
but
the
flavor
more
than
made
up
for
the
beer
where
it
was
lacking
o
a
super
easy
drinking
ale
with
a
nonoffensive
flavour
that
nicely
grasps
the
characteristics
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
especially
on
a
nice
sunny
spring
day
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
this
beer
this
spring
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
seasonal
overall
a
great
refreshing
summer
beer
that
has
just
enough
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
and
yet
not
too
overpowering
with
the
limited
selection
of
decent
beers
in
my
area
this
is
something
that
was
worth
buying
for
sure
ill
buy
it
again
o
a
very
interesting
kellerbier
with
american
hops
a
nice
twist
the
body
was
mostly
even
and
smooth
although
there
was
just
a
tiny
bite
at
the
end
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
pleasantly
and
i
could
see
having
a
couple
of
these
on
a
sunny
day
overall
a
nice
brew
not
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
but
one
thats
certainly
worth
a
shot
when
you
see
it
while
i
would
recommend
this
a
good
choice
for
a
light
beer
that
is
not
overwhelming
in
taste
or
hops
i
was
not
overly
impressed
ive
had
much
better
from
sam
adams
and
for
the
same
price
i
got
this
for
i
think
i
prefer
noble
pils
for
a
sams
spring
beer
o
alpine
spring
is
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
on
par
for
the
style
its
a
wellbalanced
light
spring
brew
probably
my
favourite
of
the
samuel
adams
seasonal
beers
available
in
canada
but
id
still
prefer
to
have
noble
pils
around
its
somewhat
unique
yet
has
a
distinct
yup
thats
sam
adams
familiarity
a
curveball
offering
to
say
the
least
it
wont
make
me
forget
about
noble
pils
during
the
spring
although
this
is
not
one
id
reject
o
solid
tasty
refreshing
beer
great
for
those
first
warm
days
for
spring
go
drink
some
overall
a
decent
keller
bier
that
is
easy
drinking
and
i
expect
excellent
on
a
warm
day
certainly
not
as
earthy
and
complex
or
as
good
as
the
creemore
offering
in
this
style
but
nonetheless
very
decent
note
fresh
by
date
is
june
2012
drank
in
february
2012
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
first
keller
bier
not
a
complicated
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
flavorful
and
refreshing
great
for
drinking
during
the
spring
would
recommend
trying
this
while
its
available
o
nice
alternative
to
the
big
breweries
summer
efforts
but
not
memorable
hazy
orange
colour
with
a
little
over
a
finger
of
dense
white
head
some
lace
webs
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
has
a
nice
hoppy
presence
zesty
citrus
fruit
in
the
way
of
a
lemonlime
scent
grassy
lightly
sweet
cereal
malt
and
honey
graham
crackers
taste
is
citrus
up
front
with
more
of
that
lemonlime
found
in
the
nose
floral
grassy
flavours
malt
is
present
in
the
way
of
honey
and
graham
crackercereal
flavours
bitter
throughout
with
a
citrus
aftertaste
medium
prickly
carbonation
creamy
feel
with
a
good
weight
good
overall
and
easily
drinkable
not
my
favourite
sam
adams
offering
but
serviceable
and
pleasant
overall
i
know
i
said
some
bad
things
about
this
beer
but
i
love
it
stylistically
if
it
were
an
ale
it
would
be
a
different
story
but
since
its
a
keller
bier
it
had
to
knock
it
but
i
love
it
its
just
starting
to
warm
up
and
it
goes
great
with
the
first
two
bbqs
ive
had
this
year
really
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
maibock
pours
light
to
medium
amber
with
a
good
head
of
white
foam
light
citrus
nose
some
honey
citrus
taste
german
pilsy
finish
smooth
and
creamy
throughout
lemon
is
the
dominant
flavor
but
overall
a
bright
flavorful
lager
real
good
easy
spring
drinker
overall
a
very
good
beer
though
really
the
first
amongst
its
style
that
i
have
tried
recommended
food
pairings
would
be
spicy
foods
buffalo
wings
or
barbecued
ribs
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
mix
in
the
nose
there
was
a
fruity
sweetness
which
really
helped
to
cut
the
grain
this
grain
through
the
taste
however
was
overly
sour
at
times
much
like
the
dirtiness
of
a
blue
moon
while
this
fit
the
style
and
was
decently
refreshing
this
beer
was
muddy
around
the
edges
and
overly
mealy
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
thought
i
would
hats
off
to
bbc
for
this
one
o
overall
a
pretty
good
spring
beer
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
pils
but
the
mix
of
smells
and
flavors
are
great
with
a
good
abv
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
appearance
is
a
cloudy
unfiltered
yellow
orange
supporting
an
easily
dissipating
head
and
spotted
lace
smell
of
light
malt
hop
with
a
refreshing
citrus
note
taste
the
sweet
notes
of
the
tworow
pale
and
honey
malt
with
a
citrus
note
that
lets
you
know
its
there
mixed
in
with
the
unfiltered
yeast
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
with
good
carbonation
it
does
have
a
character
of
its
own
to
make
its
place
on
these
upcoming
warmer
days
overall
decent
brew
but
the
previous
sping
seasonals
by
sam
adams
were
far
better
a
nice
soft
spring
lager
with
the
euro
version
of
citrus
as
a
suggestion
rather
than
that
of
an
edict
easy
to
drink
just
dont
be
expecting
those
jagged
saaz
edges
i
can
see
myself
getting
this
beer
again
but
it
wont
be
on
the
top
of
my
list
i
also
think
this
one
might
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
on
a
really
hot
day
after
some
hard
work
this
might
be
a
better
beer
for
summer
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
crisp
finish
that
makes
this
easily
drinkable
i
could
throw
a
couple
of
these
back
mindlessly
in
the
summer
with
no
issues
o
such
a
refreshing
seemingly
simple
and
yet
crisp
and
complex
beer
i
will
enjoy
this
a
couple
times
for
some
early
spring
grilling
a
pretty
good
effort
here
from
sam
adams
this
is
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
overall
a
bit
more
character
would
do
this
offering
justice
but
as
it
is
its
pretty
good
take
on
a
lesser
appreciated
style
it
goes
down
well
on
warm
spring
day
happy
to
find
this
at
the
tampa
airport
chilis
served
cold
in
a
tall
glass
this
one
shows
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
respectable
feathery
white
head
and
decent
lacing
i
can
smell
simple
wheat
and
slightly
yeasty
bread
nothing
much
but
pleasant
enough
the
flavor
keeps
to
that
theme
with
the
addition
of
lemony
sunshine
and
a
peppery
pineapple
touch
lots
more
yeasty
bread
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
very
frisky
carbonation
and
feel
quite
refreshing
with
a
little
bit
of
a
dry
citrus
hop
finish
very
decent
stuff
descent
overall
nice
for
a
warm
spring
day
in
the
south
o
an
enjoyable
spring
seasonal
and
the
first
keller
bier
ive
ever
tried
id
like
to
check
out
more
of
this
style
instantly
one
of
my
favorite
sa
seasonals
a
versatile
spring
lager
with
some
substance
to
handle
the
spring
chill
and
the
citrus
brightens
it
up
for
those
warmer
days
i
can
appreciate
the
fusion
of
different
european
influences
that
went
into
this
still
a
hohum
offering
that
is
as
sessionable
as
it
is
average
overall
a
very
nice
beer
its
very
refreshing
and
is
a
great
choice
for
the
hot
florida
spring
these
are
pretty
easy
to
drink
thats
for
sure
i
always
enjoy
sam
adams
brews
more
then
i
think
i
will
decent
stuff
for
the
spring
sun
overall
a
nice
springtime
summertime
brew
m
a
surprise
quite
good
with
a
yeasty
citrus
fullness
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
orange
color
body
with
a
lot
of
tine
bubbles
going
up
the
body
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
ot
it
the
smell
is
of
lager
yeast
and
some
lemon
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
of
lemon
and
with
no
tartness
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
really
good
and
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
a
nice
combination
of
citrus
and
lager
qualities
well
done
and
recommended
o
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
from
sam
adams
not
super
interesting
but
i
can
appreciate
what
they
are
going
for
with
it
went
on
a
beer
run
today
found
this
beer
marked
down
thought
what
the
hey
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
mug
honey
in
color
with
a
nice
head
and
a
lemon
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
with
the
malt
overall
it
is
another
decent
beer
from
the
people
at
the
boston
beer
company
o
this
is
a
very
good
summer
time
lager
readily
available
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
certainly
be
revisiting
this
one
during
the
summer
months
osam
adams
needs
to
stop
making
beers
with
lemon
flavors
this
and
coastal
wheat
both
are
poor
beers
a
decent
enough
lager
a
good
example
of
an
unexciting
style
nice
not
must
have
cheers
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
alpine
spring
is
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
thick
soapyfoamy
head
smell
is
a
bit
subdued
but
is
of
citrusy
hops
and
crisp
grain
notes
flavor
is
light
and
citrusy
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
a
slick
carbonation
overall
another
good
one
by
sa
would
look
to
this
over
most
of
the
available
fair
at
most
public
settings
overall
not
too
sweet
never
very
hoppy
and
could
use
a
bit
more
crispness
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
on
bottle
and
on
draft
at
various
times
and
it
never
quite
manages
to
satisfy
on
tap
i
loved
the
body
of
as
it
was
smooth
like
a
lager
and
creamy
like
an
unfiltered
wheat
the
best
of
both
worlds
however
i
had
alpine
spring
in
a
bottle
last
night
and
its
crisp
and
zesty
and
not
at
all
as
good
imo
odd
that
the
same
beer
should
taste
so
different
bone
white
head
of
whipped
up
froth
crackles
with
popping
bubbles
and
dissipates
quickly
down
to
a
surface
coating
thin
if
any
lacing
left
behind
pale
metallic
orange
in
hue
slightly
yellow
at
the
rims
a
few
very
scattered
bubbles
randomly
arrayed
the
nose
is
not
soft
per
se
however
it
does
recline
into
your
nostrils
with
nonaggressive
warm
bread
flowers
honey
and
peach
pit
scents
picks
it
up
some
via
herbaceous
and
salty
notes
some
dried
white
citrus
pith
too
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
accommodating
and
interesting
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
lends
it
added
creaminess
gently
fills
the
mouth
here
the
citrus
and
peach
apple
apricot
fruit
sweeter
especially
as
it
warms
the
honey
to
brown
sugar
element
fits
in
just
fine
here
although
tends
to
cover
up
the
floral
side
some
the
salt
and
pepper
dried
grass
and
mineral
notes
dry
it
out
as
it
gets
nearer
the
finish
again
neither
hops
nor
malts
predominate
any
bitterness
simply
brings
needed
freshness
visàvis
the
underlying
sweetness
maintains
its
grip
long
after
you
swallow
while
easy
to
drink
could
as
easily
be
underestimated
overall
this
is
a
great
spring
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
gotta
tip
my
hat
to
the
guys
at
sam
adams
they
deserve
more
credit
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
allspice
taste
is
a
huge
honey
flavor
up
front
followed
by
some
rich
bread
in
the
middle
and
a
lemony
fresh
citrus
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
for
the
abv
medium
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
of
a
style
i
dont
get
to
drink
much
of
o
a
great
new
spring
seasonal
offering
by
sam
adams
maybe
theyll
make
this
yearround
like
noble
pils
someday
this
brew
has
a
bright
gold
with
a
cloudy
appearance
sits
well
in
the
glass
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
a
good
blend
of
hops
and
citus
very
nice
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
and
leaves
the
tongue
very
nicely
as
far
as
taste
this
ranks
well
for
a
wheat
brew
there
is
just
a
slight
hint
of
the
citrus
in
the
brew
enough
to
help
this
brew
go
down
overall
we
feel
that
sam
adams
has
done
it
again
samuel
adams
alpine
spring
is
a
cloudy
sparkling
golden
beer
with
a
leathery
white
film
that
leaves
decent
lacing
it
has
a
grainy
aroma
with
notes
of
lemon
and
wet
paper
it
has
a
very
smooth
medium
body
with
a
crisp
finish
it
tastes
grainy
and
lemony
like
the
aroma
its
just
a
hint
sweet
and
kind
of
tangy
the
bitterness
is
faint
and
shyly
pokes
its
head
through
the
lemon
pepper
finish
this
tangy
brew
might
be
more
appropriate
in
summer
its
a
lager
pretending
to
be
a
wheat
ale
the
new
sam
adams
seasonal
my
first
stab
at
the
kellerzwickel
beer
a
great
session
beer
for
sure
a
nice
crisp
beer
with
great
citrusytangy
notes
clean
finish
and
super
drinkable
i
do
miss
the
white
ale
but
this
is
a
damn
good
substitute
wont
knock
your
socks
off
and
isnt
crazy
different
by
any
means
but
for
a
good
all
around
beer
that
reminds
you
of
upcoming
warm
weather
it
gets
the
job
done
this
beer
makes
its
way
over
your
tongue
like
a
medium
bodied
brew
then
near
the
back
seems
to
just
bite
down
on
it
it
is
a
rather
unique
sensation
in
that
the
carbonation
doesnt
seem
to
hit
right
away
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
july
2012
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
nice
but
a
bit
light
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
along
with
some
bready
malt
the
taste
is
mostly
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
light
floral
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
soft
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
decent
overall
brew
i
picked
up
this
bottle
as
a
single
but
id
buy
it
again
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
warmer
spring
days
its
good
for
the
hopheads
who
want
there
hops
but
need
an
abv
break
id
grab
a
six
pack
have
them
on
the
hammock
trail
and
that
would
be
all
she
wrote
on
the
downside
the
grass
notes
can
be
overwhelming
at
first
then
i
could
imagine
again
if
you
had
a
couple
of
these
poured
a
cloudy
orangish
gold
with
good
twofinger
head
and
lace
smell
was
typcial
of
a
sam
adams
light
beer
of
this
style
citrusy
hoppy
not
much
else
as
spices
and
malts
are
pushed
into
the
background
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
although
partly
bc
its
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
hops
provide
a
nice
bite
and
there
are
some
discernible
citricspice
hop
notes
but
this
isnt
too
complex
and
i
cant
really
say
any
sweetness
from
the
malts
arrives
for
balance
although
im
not
going
to
call
this
beer
bitter
or
watery
bc
there
is
some
balance
the
taste
of
spring
in
a
bottle
with
this
releasing
right
upon
the
cusp
of
the
spring
season
in
the
midatlantic
and
northeast
it
gives
the
person
partaking
a
smell
and
taste
of
a
fresh
mountain
spring
this
beer
is
light
crisp
smooth
when
poured
correctly
from
a
bottle
there
is
a
slight
haziness
that
many
beer
drinkers
welcome
overall
an
above
average
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
the
beer
produced
a
golden
color
with
a
mild
citrus
aroma
this
is
an
easy
sipping
beer
on
a
hot
day
the
initial
taste
was
an
earthy
flavor
balanced
with
nice
hints
of
honey
and
citrus
the
flavor
was
swept
away
by
an
aggressive
wave
of
carbonation
it
was
almost
soda
quality
carbonation
at
the
end
a
lemony
aftertaste
was
left
behind
it
bordered
on
having
an
acidic
quality
to
it
in
a
lot
of
ways
this
felt
like
a
shandy
however
unlike
most
shandys
i
did
not
completely
dislike
this
beer
really
wanted
to
like
this
more
than
i
do
next
time
ill
grab
the
noble
pils
which
i
like
much
better
sam
adams
alpine
spring
this
was
the
sam
adams
on
tap
selection
at
a
resort
in
phoenix
it
has
a
cloudy
honey
color
with
a
pure
white
head
that
fades
quickly
no
aroma
of
note
the
flavor
is
light
and
fresh
predominately
citrus
no
carbonation
but
i
had
it
on
tap
so
you
never
know
how
fresh
the
keg
was
a
good
choice
for
easy
summer
consumption
overall
its
not
generic
by
any
means
due
to
the
combination
of
freshness
and
malt
but
im
dont
find
this
a
particularly
interesting
or
deep
beer
pleasant
and
drinkable
though
o
very
good
and
very
refreshing
light
as
in
color
beer
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
again
every
spring
o
its
pretty
good
a
sessionable
beer
with
some
good
flavor
and
smell
above
average
for
sure
good
but
not
great
had
this
in
the
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
of
this
sam
adams
was
good
nice
decent
head
the
smell
was
citrusy
the
taste
was
pretty
good
the
beer
had
decent
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
overall
it
was
a
b
in
my
book
i
actually
couldnt
find
where
the
abv
was
on
the
bottle
so
i
am
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
5
5
the
alcohol
was
a
hair
high
here
but
since
this
style
emulates
the
strength
of
a
bock
it
was
fitting
that
this
had
just
a
bit
of
punch
to
it
while
this
wasnt
as
filling
as
hefeweizen
and
was
drier
in
the
mouthfeel
this
was
just
as
good
and
easy
to
quaff
as
that
style
sam
has
a
winner
on
its
hands
here
and
its
hard
to
not
envision
this
being
a
goto
beer
during
the
spring
overall
loved
it
for
what
it
is
i
would
like
this
to
hang
around
until
summer
would
love
to
serve
at
a
bbq
and
see
peoples
reaction
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
will
be
getting
more
before
it
is
gone
try
it
youll
like
it
lets
not
fool
many
of
us
we
love
beer
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
drunk
beers
by
sam
adams
goes
down
delicious
from
the
beginning
until
the
12th
as
a
famous
drunk
once
said
brevity
is
the
soul
of

characters
this
isnt
bad
but
it
certainly
isnt
something
to
be
sought
out
but
im
glad
i
have
had
it
as
it
is
now
a
check
mark
in
the
past
a
tasty
spring
time
beer
that
looks
good
and
has
some
nice
complexity
to
it
would
be
great
with
a
cheeseburger
or
a
hawaiian
pizza
this
is
a
very
good
spring
lager
and
also
excellent
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
easy
to
drink
with
lots
of
flavor
i
could
drink
this
regularly
o
very
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
that
is
great
for
spring
or
summer
really
nice
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
edit
tried
this
again
in
a
bottle
was
no
way
near
as
good
id
give
this
maybe
a
3
in
the
bottlebig
difference
the
feel
is
crisp
and
with
a
flowing
smoothness
but
a
touch
grainy
and
not
as
clean
as
it
could
be
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
it
would
be
best
suited
to
spring
or
summer
weather
when
it
is
warmer
overall
a
very
drinkable
spring
brew
im
not
much
on
lagers
and
the
floral
nail
polish
element
is
there
but
its
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
golden
yellow
to
slight
orange
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
sweetness
with
some
citrus
and
a
nice
honey
aroma
the
taste
has
a
bready
backbone
with
a
slight
mild
noble
hop
bite
to
it
there
is
also
a
taste
of
citrus
and
then
a
nice
honey
flavor
at
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
it
is
a
very
easy
drink
and
very
enjoyable
this
would
make
a
perfect
spring
session
beer
o
a
nice
spring
drinker
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
but
not
a
must
have
seasonal
in
my
opinion
overall
very
drinkable
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
more
hop
bite
this
could
be
a
favorite
overall
i
suppose
this
beer
is
good
and
could
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
however
the
malt
is
a
little
overbearing
and
the
feel
does
not
do
its
part
to
make
this
beer
as
enjoyable
as
it
could
be
medium
bodied
light
on
the
carbonation
sticky
dry
d
a
good
well
made
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
lacking
something
i
like
it
i
dont
love
it
and
would
probably
not
pick
up
a
sixer
at
the
same
time
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
find
in
a
cooler
at
the
beach
or
someones
pool
solid
beer
a
refreshing
beer
for
warmer
days
poured
from
a

12
oz
bottle

a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch

smell
is

taste
is
crisp
citrus
malts
and
grains
very
refreshing
feels
full

and
overall
is
an
easy

and
good
quality

single

thick

with
lots
of

on
a

is
also
fairly
floral
with
lots

orange
peel
medium

and
moderate

high
carbonation
overall
drinkable
not
too
complex
a
decent
beer
fairly
decent
overall
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
or
have
my
asking
for
another
pale
orange
gold
and
slightly
hazy
in
the
glass
the
head
is
made
up
of
fine
white
bubbles
that
lace
nicely
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
peppery
and
citrus
tettnang
hops
which
are
backed
by
bready
caramel
and
pale
malts
the
hop
aroma
may
be
a
bit
strong
for
a
german
lager
but
i
like
it
the
taste
too
is
dominated
by
the
hops
with
the
pepper
citrus
and
grassy
flavors
all
coming
through
the
malt
base
is
assertive
enough
but
could
have
been
fuller
as
the
hops
seem
a
bit
overly
brash
for
a
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
light
and
refreshing
with
a
clean
finish
that
leaves
only
a
hint
of
the
hop
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
ive
also
had
this
on
tap
and
think
it
is
better
there
than
out
of
the
bottle
as
it
tastes
fresher
but
even
in
the
bottle
it
is
a
great
offering
for
the
spring
o
this
was
quite
good
and
fits
well
in
its
spring
seasonal
role
i
dont
think
i
would
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
next
spring
part
of
the
spring
mixed
pack
picked
up
in
maui
this
is
a
nice
citrusy
lager
with
some
fresh
hops
and
a
crisp
finish
good
choice
for
a
spring
seasonal
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
have
a
nice
grilled
piece
of
fish
to
go
with
it
solid
lager
that
is
a
little
different
overall
maybe
its
the
style
which
i
am
not
real
familiar
with
maybe
its
the
tettnang
hops
maybe
its
the
fact
i
prefer
porter
or
ipa
maybe
its
a
combination
thereof
i
dont
know
but
this
beer
in
my
lowly
opinion
is
way
too
sweet
it
would
be
a
good
conversion
beer
for
a
mass
market
drinker
or
maybe
someone
who
enjoys
something
like
hard
lemonade
but
its
not
my
bag
it
has
its
appreciable
qualities
but
i
wont
be
drinking
it
anymore
to
experience
them
d
light
and
drinkable
a
good
spring
beer
that
almost
comes
across
as
an
american
wheat
o
okay
but
boring
and
somewhat
overly
refined
tasting
ive
had
worse
overall
it
is
what
it
claims
to
be
some
hop
some
citrus
texture
makes
it
a
fine
spring
seasonal
o
im
not
really
a
sam
fan
i
appreciate
what
they
do
for
craft
brewing
but
consider
them
more
of
a
stepping
stool
between
the
macros
and
the
crafts
beers
like
this
make
me
rethink
that
a
great
brew
by
sam
maybe
i
should
diversify
my
samuel
adams
experience
othis
is
a
nice
beer
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
i
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
when
i
ordered
it
it
looked
like
a
hefe
or
a
pale
ale
at
first
which
i
tend
to
stay
away
from
but
from
the
taste
i
was
unexpectedly
suprised
great
taste
i
instantly
looked
it
up
online
to
find
out
what
it
really
was
and
am
now
happy
i
ordered
it
a
must
if
and
when
its
avaliable
o
this
was
an
interesting
attempt
at
a
new
beer
for
sam
adams
but
its
not
something
id
sit
down
and
drink
a
couple
of
the
bitternesstart
is
what
would
make
me
look
for
another
beer
an
ok
spring
lager
but
id
prefer
noble
pils
or
the
kolsch
spring
ale
from
a
few
years
back
this
beer
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
for
a
warm
day
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
tart
lemony
and
fresh
a
pretty
neat
beer
style
although
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
although
as
a
spring
seasonal
i
think
it
will
do
well
o
this
would
make
a
good
session
perfect
for
a
hot
muggy
spring
day
pretty
damn
refreshing
pours
a
hazed
golden
blonde
color
akin
to
a
wit
light
fluffy
pillow
of
head
moderate
retention
scent
is
pale
and
leads
with
citrus
blends
with
some
lightly
sweet
and
faintly
doughy
malts
and
yeasts
hints
of
floral
hops
come
through
later
in
the
scent
taste
leads
with
quick
note
of
watery
citrus
lightly
floral
notes
light
doughy
bready
kicks
off
the
malt
and
yeast
profile
some
faint
caramel
also
present
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
somewhat
watery
towards
the
end
a
good
flavored
crowd
pleaser
which
is
what
most
of
sams
seasonals
have
become
o
the
idea
of
a
unfiltered
lager
is
nice
and
i
enjoy
the
lemon
from
the
hops
it
doesnt
have
the
crispness
of
a
really
good
lager
and
the
body
is
rather
thin
its
a
nice
beer
and
i
like
to
see
boston
beer
doing
things
like
this
its
tougher
to
do
smaller
niche
style
than
to
throw
a
whole
lot
of
spices
in
a
beer
and
call
it
extreme
this
is
a
nice
attempt
at
that
o
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
from
sam
adams
just
not
a
lot
going
on
in
either
the
nose
or
taste
not
offensive
or
anything
but
not
worth
the
time
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
expectations
werent
high
but
this
is
an
average
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
cant
say
that
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
overly
salty
but
if
it
wasnt
for
that
it
would
have
been
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
the
refreshing
a
light
body
not
very
complex
but
it
does
what
it
says
on
the
tin
so
to
speak
so
i
cant
really
fault
it
for
that
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
aroma
and
some
more
interesting
malt
flavors
d
i
got
two
of
these
in
a
variety
pack
they
will
be
enough
i
liked
this
balanced
nicely
with
a
nice
piney
kick
overall
this
beer
is
overpowered
by
the
yeast
and
alcohol
really
coming
through
above
the
other
flavors
despite
the
citrus
smell
these
flavors
dont
really
play
into
the
beer
and
it
doesnt
really
bring
anything
to
the
table
very
sour
and
doesnt
sit
well
perhaps
mine
if
from
a
bad
batch
or
so
as
i
dont
seem
to
think
its
as
good
as
other
people
do
o
i
dont
know
enough
to
say
if
this
is
true
to
stlye
but
it
did
seem
kind
of
watered
down
to
me
sam
adams
alpine
springs
pours
a
hazy
dark
yellow
thats
almost
orange
in
color
theres
about
a
finger
of
white
foam
that
crowns
the
beer
displaying
good
head
retention
and
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
pretty
solid
carrying
notes
of
crisp
bready
malts
and
lemon
zest
the
malt
in
the
flavor
profile
is
still
definitely
bready
but
its
a
bit
more
rounded
and
chewy
than
in
the
aroma
theres
a
light
wave
of
bitterness
that
comes
through
mid
palate
before
some
floral
and
lemonfocused
citrus
flavors
provide
a
nice
finish
the
beer
is
nice
and
full
bodied
but
the
accompanying
carbonation
is
just
a
little
too
prickly
on
my
tongue
alpine
spring
is
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
but
the
combination
of
pale
ale
like
hoppiness
and
the
smooth
maltiness
of
a
traditional
lager
results
in
a
tasty
easydrinking
beer
o
again
i
plead
with
you
just
make
an
ipa
and
stop
releasing
these
strange
almost
ipas
this
was
tasty
but
nothing
even
close
to
special
the
spring
mix
pack
is
just
a
complete
miss
for
me
spring
beer
released
in
january
this
beer
expires
before
spring
even
occurs
hahaha
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
white
three
finger
length
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
some
bubbles
can
be
seen
even
though
the
beer
is
a
hazy
the
smell
is
floral
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
hints
of
bright
citrus
and
some
spiciness
from
the
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
and
this
is
balanced
by
tart
citrus
flavors
from
the
hops
its
a
very
bright
and
crisp
taste
the
carbonation
prepares
you
for
each
sip
of
this
easy
drinker
its
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
perfect
on
a
warm
spring
day
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
sam
adams
while
its
nothing
bold
or
surprising
its
the
perfect
beer
on
a
warm
texas
spring
day
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
its
not
an
overly
complex
beer
or
even
outstanding
but
its
solid
and
refreshing
overall
a
terrific
lager
a
great
springsummer
beer
perfect
for
relaxing
by
the
pool
or
mowing
the
lawn
pertty
complex
well
balanced
very
drinkable
it
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
orange
hues
with
tiny
bits
of
yeast
floating
the
head
is
white
and
fluffy
about
two
fingers
thick
and
lingers
for
a
long
time
while
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
spice
and
earthy
noble
hops
with
a
small
amount
of
sulfur
that
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
comprised
of
earthy
tones
grass
toffee
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
the
mouth
feel
is
lightmedium
with
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
its
a
good
pilsner
and
something
i
would
probably
drink
if
the
weather
was
warmer
but
winter
is
a
little
too
early
for
pilsners
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
a
great
lawnmower
selection
note
to
self
ranked

kellerbier
zwickelbier
when
i
reviewed
this
one
drinkability
is
good
and
overall
really
refreshing
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
i
dont
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
as
the
sweetness
wears
on
my
palate
but
it
is
still
a
refreshing
and
tasty
beverage
this
beer
would
be
nice
for
sessioning
when
playing
hookie
from
work
on
warm
spring
days
i
went
into
this
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
hoppy
for
some
reason
but
really
was
surprised
and
exceeded
my
expectations
at
that
samuel
adams
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
even
after
having
tried
a
fair
amount
of
craft
beers
overall
i
enjoyed
it
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
it
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
i
would
order
it
a
bar
if
the
only
choices
were
of
the
bmc
variety
pours
a
honey
gold
with
a
white
creamy
head
strong
head
retention
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
banana
bouquet
soft
slick
mouthfeel
with
prevalent
citrus
finishes
with
a
mild
lemon
banana
fun
summery
beer
could
boston
brewing
actually
be
answering
the
call
of
their
years
long
undeserved
hype
well
done
pours
a
cloudy
medium
gold
in
color
thick
two
finger
white
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lace
that
both
hold
up
very
well
strong
bold
citrus
and
a
light
floral
aroma
nice
blending
of
the
orange
citrus
taste
with
the
yeast
and
hops
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
slight
pepper
taste
this
beer
wins
on
all
counts
i
see
this
beer
going
a
long
way
with
sam
adams
definitely
one
of
their
better
brewed
beers
ill
try
it
ontap
next
o
very
impressive
complex
lager
for
a
seemingly
simple
beer
well
done
boston
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
prominent
hop
content
for
a
lager
with
goes
nice
with
the
malts
which
surprises
me
that
its
not
scored
higher
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
something
to
drink
in
the
warmer
weather
o
pretty
enjoyable
i
havent
had
many
in
this
style
and
i
like
surly
hell
quite
a
bit
more
but
i
would
drink
this
again
its
an
easy
drinking
but
still
flavorful
brew
d
this
thing
goes
down
super
easily
a
lot
like
the
boston
lager
but
with
a
bit
more
of
a
floralcitrusmint
twist
a
nice
beer
all
around
but
maybe
not
exotic
enough
to
have
me
seek
it
out
more
than
a
few
times
o
pretty
good
not
super
complex
can
definitely
see
this
appealing
to
a
more
moderate
beer
drinker
a
sa
brew
to
the
tee
in
terms
of
taste
and
flavor
complexity
o
the
hoppiness
made
it
resemble
more
of
an
ipa
but
i
guess
the
citrus
undertones
is
what
makes
it
a
spring
beer
will
drink
again
but
nothing
outstanding
overall
trying
this
for
the
first
time
it
is
definitely
your
warm
weather
beer
smooth
and
would
love
to
have
this
while
i
am
barbequing
reminds
me
of
a
weisen
meets
your
summer
ale
like
the
both
above
but
different
in
its
own
class
hope
you
all
enjoy
salud
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
slowly
scent
has
some
germanlike
malt
profile
to
it
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
hoppiness
some
grain
very
mellow
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
nose
all
the
aromas
are
very
subdued
taste
is
quite
a
bit
better
initially
i
get
german
malt
flavors
with
some
light
hops
and
lemon
a
hint
of
orange
with
some
biscuit
kinda
remind
me
of
a
very
hoppy
kolsch
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
could
use
a
better
aroma
to
make
this
thing
a
powerhouse
session
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
it
a
little
higher
abv
than
the
average
and
good
flavor
this
is
the
second
time
having
it
and
i
figured
might
as
well
do
a
review
so
there
you
have
it
o
this
beer
certainly
is
great
if
you
are
looking
for
something
light
on
a
spring
afternoon
but
the
lack
of
beerlike
character
leaves
me
wanting
more
certainly
a
huge
upgrade
to
the
bud
light
drinkers
in
your
life
i
could
see
myself
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
on
an
afternoon
on
the
lake
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
i
would
easily
have
another
a
great
looking
beer
and
a
very
good
germanstyle
lager
sam
adams
puts
out
a
generally
excellent
lineup
of
beers
across
the
board
any
brewer
is
going
to
let
a
clunker
slip
through
every
so
often
and
so
is
the
case
with
alpine
spring
what
i
find
surprising
however
is
that
this
is
a
major
seasonal
offering
not
just
a
oneof
that
didnt
work
out
the
brewer
lists
some
lofty
inspirations
and
ingredients
but
here
the
sum
is
less
than
the
parts
grainy
rough
and
unpolished
are
the
descriptors
that
come
to
mind
a
distinct
raw
grain
flavor
dominates
and
the
hops
are
blunt
and
nondescript
mouthfeel
has
the
nice
crisp
texture
that
i
look
for
in
lagers
overall
a
wonderfully
refreshing
lager
flavorful
but
easy
drinking
kind
of
scary
to
think
how
easy
it
would
be
to
drink
a
few
too
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
o
seems
like
a
mix
of
german
styles
that
is
hard
to
describe
mixed
with
a
bit
of
american
hoppiness
it
was
decent
at
best
but
nothing
id
buy
again
i
am
not
to
familiar
with
the
keller
style
but
this
seems
spot
on
to
me
great
spring
brew
from
samuel
adams
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewer
i
rarely
if
ever
buy
anything
from
samuel
adams
but
to
just
try
i
may
actually
buy
some
more
of
this
one
its
a
goodie
ov
fun
to
try
but
leave
it
at
that
youre
better
off
with
blue
moon
if
youre
craving
a
citrus
kick
this
beer
fell
short
considering
the
source
at
710
a
6
pack
its
a
little
tough
to
swallow
when
there
are
better
choices
absolutely
delicious
and
well
balanced
a
smooth
drinkable
lager
this
is
a
nice
spring
beer
it
gives
me
an
impression
of
fresh
green
plants
and
festivities
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
crisp
and
very
drinkable
the
body
is
smooth
and
refreshing
but
a
tad
bit
sticky
the
carbonation
isnt
overly
noticeable
but
is
definitely
helpful
in
the
swallow
overall
alpine
spring
is
a
decent
spring
lager
i
dont
love
it
like
i
do
noble
pils
but
its
a
tasty
lager
and
and
again
i
like
that
sam
adams
is
trying
new
styles
ill
be
picking
up
a
few
more
of
these
this
spring
o
a
rather
pleasant
tasting
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
sam
adams
now
has
two
spring
beers
worth
picking
up
noble
pils
is
the
other
beer
o
i
dont
think
this
is
a
sam
adams
brew
that
id
buy
again
its
very
boring
and
basic
to
me
the
flavor
profile
tastes
of
nothing
but
lager
yeast
and
a
pinch
of
hops
and
the
smell
is
very
similar
id
drink
it
again
but
im
not
buying
it
again
o
easy
drinking
but
nothing
special
seems
like
a
decent
summer
beer
o
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
more
than
sam
summer
ale
likely
due
to
the
more
pilsner
like
qualities
certainly
glad
this
will
be
around
even
in
noncraft
beer
friendly
establishments
through
the
spring
i
was
tempted
by
the
labels
notice
of
citrus
flavors
and
unfilteredness
two
qualities
i
like
in
a
beer
i
was
not
disappointed
the
beer
poured
a
nice
goldenbrown
with
a
fine
head
and
a
slight
lacing
the
mouthfeel
was
just
the
right
carbonation
the
aroma
just
fine
and
a
pleasant
additional
taste
of
sour
grain
remnants
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pint
at
52
degrees
best
before
june
notched
on
the
label
pours
a
dull
light
tangerine
hue
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
loose
quarter
inch
creamcolored
head
nose
expresses
citrus
zest
a
noble
hops
presence
and
a
slightly
metallic
aroma
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
there
is
also
a
distinct
earthy
wheat
character
with
a
hint
of
cereal
grain
sweetness
at
the
finish
also
the
metallic
quality
detected
in
the
nose
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
almost
crisp
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
easy
acidity
all
and
all
of
the
few
keller
biers
that
ive
tried
this
one
does
not
seem
overly
style
consistent
that
said
i
have
to
say
that
ive
really
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
the
few
times
ive
had
it
so
far
its
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
character
to
make
it
satisfying
ooverall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
springsummertime
beer
so
much
so
that
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
brew
a
beer
like
this
for
my
wife
because
she
likes
it
so
much
i
had
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
after
trying
two
in
the
mix
twelve
pack
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
people
who
live
in
a
warm
climate
right
now
get
it
while
its
fresh
cheers
everyone
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
may
not
get
the
praise
a
beer
this
balanced
deserves
ill
be
buying
another
case
or
two
of
this
before
the
spring
is
over
overall
a
great
springsummer
brew
one
with
a
nice
citrus
wheat
taste
that
is
very
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
off
white
head
good
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
biscuit
malt
lemon
and
citrusy
fruity
notes
and
some
light
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
malt
citrus
some
light
yeast
lemon
peel
and
some
nice
peppery
floral
hops
palate
is
a
medium
body
crisp
mouth
feel
and
lively
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
malt
citrus
and
lemon
peel
notes
fruity
with
some
light
spicy
bitter
peppery
hops
on
the
end
overall
a
nice
drinkable
brew
for
early
spring
huh
alot
better
than
i
thought
i
was
expecting
something
plain
and
cost
effective
replaement
for
noble
pils
this
has
a
super
thick
body
for
a
lager
huge
head
retention
no
much
aromas
as
expected
with
a
german
style
lager
flavor
is
full
of
herbal
like
flavors
very
earthy
hops
i
might
like
this
better
than
noble
well
done
sa
has
really
perfected
the
lager
style
beers
well
done
and
saved
me
at
a
regular
sports
bar
thanks
sa
served
in
a
22oz
frosted
mug
cloudy
and
golden
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
smells
great
fresh
citrus
hops
a
plenty
palate
is
refreshing
and
tasty
with
a
good
malt
base
and
strong
citrusy
hop
flavor
with
low
bitterness
on
tap
this
is
a
great
beer
that
suprised
me
a
bit
i
wasnt
expecting
this
level
of
flavor
and
aroma
this
should
stay
in
the
sa
portfolio
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
this
time
of
year
i
suppose
but
it
just
seemed
lackluster
to
me
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
very
refreshing
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
well
o
this
is
better
than
i
expected
nice
and
refreshing
nice
balance
of
flavor
overall
not
half
bad
the
palate
opens
with
a
mild
doughy
and
honeylike
sweetness
along
with
some
fruity
flavors
melon
in
particular
mild
but
firm
hop
bitterness
is
present
especially
towards
the
finish
which
also
has
some
lemony
flavor
with
nice
balance
moderately
yeasty
as
well
overcarbonated
to
a
fault
this
aspect
ruins
what
could
be
a
good
beer
imo
and
when
it
does
dissipate
it
takes
on
a
sulfury
note
and
a
rather
slimy
feel
that
said
i
went
to
summit
epa
for
my
next
beer
so
not
good
enough
to
keep
me
interested
in
a
second
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
peel
color
with
a
1
cream
colored
head
the
head
recedes
leaving
scant
spots
of
lacing
in
my
glass
it
eventually
falls
to
a
thick
film
across
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
of
tangerine
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
some
malt
sweetness
in
the
taste
i
detect
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grain
the
hops
dont
jump
out
as
much
as
expected
they
are
subtle
and
grassy
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
i
get
some
of
that
tangerine
flavor
from
the
smell
the
aftertaste
is
generally
sweet
but
it
leaves
a
slight
bitterness
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thicker
than
average
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
but
it
is
deceivingly
subtle
another
spring
home
run
for
the
boys
in
massachusetts
a
cloudy
golden
beer
with
a
frothy
head
and
active
carbonation
head
is
smallish
and
lace
is
a
bit
light
but
that
could
also
be
due
to
the
cold
serving
temperature
malty
nose
with
orangey
citrus
notes
and
a
healthy
amount
of
yeasty
dough
a
smoothly
inviting
aroma
taste
is
a
continuation
and
wonderful
progression
of
the
nose
big
malt
front
with
a
bakery
display
of
breads
and
rolls
on
my
tongue
hops
are
expertly
done
with
a
gentle
amping
up
of
a
traditional
keller
but
not
in
a
way
that
leaves
the
style
this
is
a
superb
take
on
the
style
finish
is
clean
artfully
hoppy
and
balanced
a
light
dryness
in
the
mouth
lingers
with
faint
bread
notes
feel
is
crisp
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
smooth
swallow
as
well
a
great
beer
and
i
hope
to
see
it
again
but
just
in
case
i
am
buying
some
more
of
this
to
savor
overall
the
history
of
this
beer
style
is
pretty
interesting
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
case
of
samuel
adams
alpine
spring
d
its
simple
but
its
built
well
and
its
an
easy
drinker
you
could
do
easily
do
worse
while
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
this
is
not
selling
me
on
keller
or
zwickel
beerwhich
isnt
a
surprise
since
im
not
a
fan
of
the
light
german
lagers
in
general
but
i
keep
trying
new
beers
regardless
of
this
knowledge
this
one
is
just
a
swing
and
a
miss
maybe
at
the
next
at
bat
o
this
has
good
drinkability
the
flavor
is
good
and
there
is
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
it
overall
it
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
my
first
keller
bier
so
i
cant
really
comment
on
how
close
to
style
it
is
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
i
recommend
trying
it
out
its
worth
a
shot
mediumbodied
with
modest
carbonation
that
lets
this
beer
flow
smoothly
across
the
palate
finish
is
dry
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
decently
floral
as
well
a
lot
of
yeast
contributions
notably
pepper
and
maybe
even
a
hint
of
banana
bready
malt
makes
up
the
rest
the
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
it
has
a
strange
lemony
note
on
the
finish
as
well
some
notes
of
floral
and
spicy
hops
and
maybe
some
breadmalt
flavors
o
4
so
far
no
major
flaws
have
appeared
as
they
have
with
the
whitewater
ipa
out
of
the
same
mix
the
finish
is
a
touch
astringent
lemony
and
grassy
but
not
as
annoying
as
the
spices
or
whatever
they
put
in
the
whitewater
not
something
i
will
crave
though
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
straw
notes
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
grass
and
lemons
and
some
biscuit
malt
the
flavor
has
some
pilsner
and
biscuit
malt
with
some
low
bitterness
and
some
earthy
and
grassy
hops
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
some
floral
notes
citrusy
the
taste
is
maltyyeasty
a
little
sweet
note
kinda
fruity
and
some
nice
citrus
notes
medium
body
a
nice
smooth
brew
not
a
bad
brew
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
glass
and
was
greated
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
foam
this
faded
slowly
to
nice
lacing
the
color
was
a
cloudy
but
bright
golden
hue
the
nose
was
full
of
orange
and
citrus
hops
that
faded
to
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
with
crisp
citrus
and
orange
hops
fading
to
the
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
full
good
with
plenty
of
carbonation
that
tickled
my
tongue
and
a
medium
body
that
clung
to
my
palate
i
like
this
seasonal
a
lot
it
smells
and
tastes
of
bright
hops
and
malts
its
like
spring
in
the
bottle
overall
this
is
nice
interesting
beer
to
welcome
spring
enjoyable
and
refreshing
this
is
the
type
of
beer
which
often
doesnt
get
any
love
from
beer
snobs
but
i
must
say
that
i
found
this
beer
to
be
one
of
the
tastiest
sessionable
beers
in
recent
memory
two
thumbs
up
this
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
flavor
but
it
is
relatively
balanced
with
a
little
more
hop
and
spice
than
i
usually
see
for
the
style
definitely
heavy
on
the
bready
ester
type
malts
the
texture
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
this
goes
down
pretty
easy
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
decent
interpretation
o
an
interesting
new
spring
seasonal
from
sam
adams
nowhere
near
as
full
flavoured
as
some
of
the
great
kellers
ive
had
from
germany
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
effort
for
sure
c
nice
brew
i
know
ive
said
refreshing
a
few
times
already
but
this
brew
is
certainly
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
many
of
these
in
the
summer
heat
but
its
also
enjoyable
in
the
dead
of
smarch
too
worth
a
go
gold
in
colour
and
lightly
hazed
a
gentle
pour
produced
an
inch
of
dense
offwhite
foam
that
lasted
quite
some
time
tons
of
sticky
lacing
at
first
less
as
the
glass
emptied
citrus
was
evident
as
soon
as
the
cap
was
popped
aromas
of
pils
malt
and
oranges
a
bit
floral
and
grassy
slight
breadiness
lemon
bitterness
up
front
with
honeysweet
malts
following
citrus
and
bread
slight
alcohol
and
herbal
hop
flavour
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
decent
texture
i
enjoyed
it
particularly
the
fresh
citrus
hoppiness
and
malt
character
o
i
still
love
this
beer
its
probably
a
bit
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
mostly
because
of
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
smell
and
appearance
is
similar
really
easy
drinking
and
pair
well
with
most
foods
a
great
spring
beer
o
much
better
than
i
expected
this
beer
hits
the
spot
without
being
flashy
or
in
your
face
no
problem
having
a
couple
of
these
overall
its
okay
its
not
awful
but
i
dont
think
its
good
either
a
step
of
from
their
last
spring
offering
noble
pils
awful
still
say
the
old
white
ale
was
a
great
spring
beer
from
sam
adams
taste
is
much
stronger
in
flavor
than
i
would
have
thought
starts
out
with
a
strong
grainy
malt
front
citrus
creeps
in
to
dominate
the
aftertaste
carbonation
is
soft
but
active
finishes
semidry
overall
a
desent
effort
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
when
i
want
a
keller
bier
but
pleasant
enough
and
seems
pretty
sessionable
or
perhaps
if
it
had
a
few
ticks
lower
abv
overall
i
am
quite
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
do
find
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
however
it
may
be
a
little
more
amped
up
than
others
like
it
frankly
i
took
notes
at
the
bar
at
lunch
with
absolutely
no
idea
what
classification
this
beer
would
fall
under
did
not
expect
a
kellerbier
a
style
i
enjoy
in
its
traditional
form
and
very
much
enjoyed
this
american
interpretation
well
done
samuel
adams
the
lager
tastes
very
fresh
with
hop
oils
coating
the
mouth
and
leaving
a
nice
lemony
noble
hop
flavor
which
is
somewhat
floral
too
the
malt
is
a
backdrop
giving
mild
toasted
sweetness
and
it
finishes
with
a
light
spiciness
overall
i
enjoyed
this
maybe
not
as
much
as
noble
pils
but
this
is
a
very
refreshing
lager
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
nice
drinkability
for
the
strength
overall
a
subpar
effort
from
samuel
adams
things
just
dont
seem
to
mesh
very
well
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
deep
orange
in
body
with
white
bubbly

lovin
the
aroma
citrus
floral
notes
light

tastes
of
light

harsh
lemon
zest
slight

burn
light

with

great

but
some
of
the
flavors
are
intrusive
and
harsh
wow
this
is
a
party
pleasing
buy
by
the
case
brew
here
i
could
easily
down
this
stuff
all
day
a
perfect
summertime
or
really
anytime
brew
this
is
a
great
brew
for
sa
and
will
be
a
regular
one
to
session
for
a
lager
great
stuff
here
super
easy
to
drink
light
good
taste
hard
to
complain
about
this
a
really
enjoyable
sessionable
brew
overall
a
very
friendly
and
easy
to
drink
beer
nicely
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
overall
flavor
poured
into
round
bowl
mug
hazy
orange
with
a
natural
milky
white
head
never
really
leaves
stays
thin
and
filmy
throughout
smell
isnt
much
at
all
but
a
faint
acidic
orange
and
lemon
juice
taste
also
has
juicy
orange
orange
peel
lemon
peel
clementine
and
a
little
citric
spiciness
very
nice
light
feel
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
t
this
was
a
really
nice
surprise
for
me
a
rich
graininess
throughout
with
a
good
touch
of
lemon
and
citrus
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
without
tasting
too
light
o
a
decent
beer
though
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
o
a
decent
brew
from
sa
mostly
easy
going
and
drinkable
has
a
decent
wheat
beer
taste
that
is
flavorable
but
not
as
tasty
as
some
other
sa
brews
available
a
good
lager
but
it
doesnt
really
bring
much
else
to
the
table
from
other
sam
adams
lagers
for
me
solid
spring
seasonal
but
i
prefer
different
sa
beers
o
not
too
bad
it
really
helped
to
knock
down
some
of
the
heat
from
my
wings
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
once
warmer
weather
comes
around
easy
drinking
nice
mouthfeel
perfect
transition
from
the
heavier
winter
ales
to
spring
a
beer
even
the
macro
folks
will
enjoy
it
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
someone
that
usually
drinks
lite
beer
and
to
someone
who
does
not
enjoy
american
style
hopped
beer
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
even
though
this
is
not
my
first
choie
in
types
of
beer
i
will
be
adding
this
to
my
beer
fridge
for
friends
and
family
when
they
come
over
this
beer
is
very
good
from
beginning
to
end
and
matches
with
so
many
different
food
types
i
think
you
would
be
safe
ordering
this
with
almost
anything
that
would
be
on
a
bar
menu
i
think
spicy
wings
would
be
calmed
by
the
citrus
and
the
hops
i
think
a
burger
with
onions
and
mushrooms
would
be
cleaned
from
your
palate
by
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
came
to
me
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
or
whatever
the
hell
they
call
their
boston
lager
glass
hazy
medium
golden
hue
smells
of
slight
hops
aroma
but
mostly
wheat
and
malty
notes
taste
was
actually
pretty
complex
it
didnt
have
what
i
like
to
call
the
usual
sam
adams
taste
started
off
like
a
traditional
wheat
beer
with
lighter
notes
and
grassy
tones
but
then
some
malt
came
through
ended
with
a
slight
hops
kick
but
not
much
at
all
in
among
the
sweeter
malt
profile
taste
is
a
citrus
burst
bitter
lemon
and
grapefruit
and
sweet
orange
giving
way
to
a
slightly
sweet
malt
it
finishes
with
the
sweet
sour
earthiness
of
a
belgian
a
nice
wake
up
for
the
mouth
with
some
intense
flavors
but
it
leans
a
little
too
much
to
the
sweet
side
for
me
to
seek
it
out
again
yet
another
solid
seasonal
offering
by
samuel
adams
the
flavor
profile
was
unique
the
brewery
took
a
chance
with
a
style
that
is
not
well
known
or
readily
available
had
alpine
spring
on
tap
at
mary
carrolls
in
huntington
ny
this
goldencolored
cloudy
but
not
too
cloudy
offering
has
good
carbonation
and
head
as
this
is
a
new
style
for
me
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
light
citrus
and
herbal
smell
the
taste
leans
more
toward
lemon
and
orange
than
grapefruit
which
pleases
me
the
hops
add
aroma
rather
than
bitterness
here
in
addition
to
the
citrus
characteristics
there
is
a
good
amount
of
malt
sweetness
which
is
pleasantly
balanced
by
some
tartness
id
consider
this
almost
mediumbodied
certainly
lively
and
drinkable
give
it
a
try
i
say
overall
55
quite
an
impressive
complex
lager
for
a
seemingly
simple
beer
the
pour
created
just
over
two
fingers
of
eggnogcolored
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
goldenyellow
nose
had
a
lemonycitrus
quality
along
with
a
dry
crackery
maltiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
light
dry
and
citrusy
a
perfect
counterpart
to
that
wild
dipa
that
preceded
it
i
am
amazed
that
a
style
this
ancient
is
making
a
comeback
but
this
is
a
great
time
to
be
an
aficionado
of
beer
finish
was
dry
lemon
citrusy
and
just
a
nice
mellow
pleasant
beer
all
around
i
wish
that
they
would
put
this
in
cans
as
i
am
planning
at
least
one
trip
to
the
shore
this
summer
and
i
gotta
fill
that
coola
somehow
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
light
citrus
and
small
lager
like
tones
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
earthiness
to
citrus
like
flavors
with
small
lager
like
undertones
all
the
way
through
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
yeasty
and
small
lemon
citrus
like
aftertaste
small
earth
and
citrus
with
lager
notes
it
feels
like
a
saison
and
a
lager
had
a
baby
overall
my
first
beer
of
the
style
and
i
am
pleasantly
impressed
an
overall
nice
spring
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
order
another
22
oz
mug
of
poured
this
zwickel
bier
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
and
produces
a
thick
white
head
nice
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
fresh
full
of
citrus
flavor
malted
barley
and
some
piney
hops
medium
in
body
this
brew
has
a
base
of
malted
grain
with
some
citrus
and
hops
unfiltered
yeast
also
lends
a
unique
flavor
my
first
zwickel
style
i
have
to
say
i
was
impressed
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
woody
honey
type
smell
that
is
quite
pleasant
but
not
overly
strong
has
some
nice
grassy
notes
in
the
taste
along
with
a
decent
but
not
strong
hop
taste
goes
down
smooth
with
a
good
medium
body
and
proper
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
brew
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
family
im
ok
with
a
single
but
glad
i
didnt
have
more
just
ok
odd
balance
still
ok
o
this
would
be
pretty
great
for
a
summer
beer
a
little
weird
to
get
it
in
february
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
if
i
was
making
this
myself
i
would
add
some
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
touch
more
flavor
but
this
fits
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
bone
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
but
leaves
much
lace
in
its
wake
smells
like
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
and
earth
on
top
of
biscuity
malt
not
horribly
complex
in
the
aroma
taste
is
a
mix
of
biscuit
malt
again
with
lots
of
citrus
and
earth
almost
tart
lemony
flavor
with
a
thin
malt
backbone
of
biscuit
and
pilsner
thin
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
an
almost
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
this
might
make
for
a
good
lawnmower
beer
but
by
the
time
spring
rolls
around
this
will
be
two
seasonals
ago
in
the
sam
lineup
id
rather
have
a
noble
pils
really
o
there
were
a
lot
of
flavors
in
this
one
i
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
whole
package
this
would
be
a
very
nice
spring
time
beer
though
o
solid
offering
from
sam
not
too
not
worthy
seems
kinda
like
a
combo
of
the
noble
pils
and
summer
lager
this
would
probably
taste
better
in
may
than
june
on
tap
its
pretty
solid
though
o
i
generally
like
bbc
and
appreciate
their
seasonals
just
didnt
like
this
now
i
did
get
this
at
chilis
and
they
freeze
the
hell
out
of
their
beer
but
even
letting
one
warm
up
just
didnt
work
ill
pass
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
that
falls
to
a
quilt
of
the
same
nice
frosty
lace
smells
of
grain
hay
some
corn
not
getting
the
citrus
everybody
seems
to
be
raving
about
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
grain
and
grass
with
a
little
sweetened
lemon
zest
and
some
earthy
yeast
mouthfeel
is
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
slightly
heavy
with
moderate
carb
combines
to
a
velvety
unobtrusive
body
above
average
but
not
that
great
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
going
in
and
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
lighter
but
ended
up
enjoying
it
anyway
the
lemon
zest
along
with
citrus
is
a
good
representation
of
spring
and
the
malts
and
hops
seemed
to
play
nice
togther
not
the
greatest
of
the
style
ive
had
but
very
drinkable
cloudy
deep
yellow
with
a
sharp
citric
smell
the
taste
is
more
sharp
citricorange
lemonwith
an
herbal
and
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
and
honey
malt
the
honey
malt
actually
became
more
prominent
and
sticky
throughout
the
glass
which
causes
me
to
mark
it
down
a
bit
its
nicely
zesty
but
does
feel
unbalanced
pours
our
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
tiny
head
it
smells
of
bready
malts
bright
citrus
and
hops
and
a
bit
of
wheat
the
taste
really
hits
you
with
everything
at
once
with
the
bready
malts
bright
citrus
and
fairly
upfront
but
still
bright
hops
a
bit
of
a
lagery
malt
taste
comes
in
the
middle
leading
into
a
long
bready
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
drinkability
is
good
another
winner
from
sam
adams
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
this
is
just
a
better
version
of
sam
summer
id
take
this
over
the
typical
white
ales
and
wits
most
brewers
release
in
the
spring
every
time
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
tastes
like
a
light
version
of
their
previous
years
spring
seasonal
noble
pils
overall
its
a
decent
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
operfectly
drinkable
brew
that
i
would
purchase
again
pours
to
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
moderate
lace
and
cloudy
gold
color
aroma
is
sweet
citusy
and
grainy
flavor
is
a
nice
lend
of
sweet
malts
tettnang
hops
and
subtle
yeast
esters
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pleasant
medium
co2
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
new
old
beer
style
we
can
all
enjoy
en
masse
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
honestly
seems
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
like
overall
another
solid
brew
from
sammy
real
enjoyable
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
definitely
enjoyable
a
bit
light
for
my
liking
but
decent
flavor
overall
the
aftertaste
made
me
think
of
water
with
lemon
its
so
inoffensive
and
mellow
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
positive
or
negative
id
drink
it
in
the
summer
as
a
kellerbier
i
really
like
this
had
this
on
draft
but
it
was
chilled
way
too
much
i
would
happily
drink
this
all
spring
summer
o
overall
not
a
bad
spring
ale
worth
a
try
o
im
really
enjoying
this
right
now
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
new
spring
seasonal
from
sa
this
was
an
easy
drinker
that
i
enjoyed
rjt
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
it
ended
up
disappointing
me
somewhat
that
being
said
i
liked
it
and
would
order
it
a
bar
for
sure
overall
im
a
fan
of
most
of
sam
adams
offerings
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
tasted
watered
down
and
all
of
the
flavors
were
somewhat
muted
i
barely
got
any
of
the
citrus
notes
that
were
advertised
it
was
certainly
drinkable
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
was
hoping
this
would
have
a
bit
more
character
it
is
more
of
a
substitute
for
a
mass
market
superbowl
beer
really
so
glad
this
wasnt
a
permanent
replacement
for
noble
pils
which
is
exponentially
more
flavorful
while
still
being
subtle
and
balanced
simply
solid
and
enjoyable
not
mindblowing
just
good
pours
clouded
lemon
yellow

with
nice
but
short
lasting
white

not
much
lacing
scent
is
lemon
grass
taste
is
zingy
lemon
citrus
honey
a
little
bit
acidic
but
very
nice
overall
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
go
along
with
the
transition
from
winter
to
spring
almost
tastes
like
a
sierra
nevada
pale
and
a
vienna
lager
combination
rich
body
with
plentiful
carbonation
well
balanced
with
a
clean
mildly
sour
malt
start
the
hop
bitterness
is
notable
but
not
overpowering
lightly
creamy
easy
to
consume
more
than
one
pours

good
appearance
body
and

o
overall
it
could
have
been
a
good
solid
4
0
from
me
but
at
9
for
a
sixer
there
are
similar
or
better
beers
close
to
this
style
and
quality
that
are
a
bit
cheaper
im
not
complaining
too
much
though
as
i
am
enjoying
everything
else
about
this
beer
and
it
certainly
bested
my
expectations
id
drink
it
again
i
dont
know
if
id
pay
9
for
a
6pack
of
it
again
but
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
if
offered
alpine
spring
is
a
pretty
good
release
from
boston
beer
company
its
rather
simple
and
straight
forward
if
youre
looking
for
complexity
look
elsewhere
for
the
most
part
it
performs
pretty
well
all
around
i
think
id
prefer
a
little
more
citrus
and
a
little
less
grass
just
an
observation
its
pretty
good
though
definitely
worth
checking
out
one
of
sams
best
offerings
in
a
while
it
doesnt
have
the
punch
of
noble
pils
but
its
a
keeper
nice
job
jim
overall
i
was
really
shocked
at
how
spectacular
this
beer
is
it
truely
is
a
wonderful
beer
similar
to
the
noble
hops
but
has
some
slightly
different
characteristics
that
are
very
nice
o
alpine
spring
put
up
a
valiant
effort
it
came
out
swinging
but
went
down
in
the
second
round
samuel
adams
tries
to
do
this
obscure
style
justice
by
brewing
it
but
the
lack
of
flavor
and
body
signify
to
me
that
this
seasonal
wont
be
back
after
its
departure
i
will
say
though
while
the
haze
might
scare
some
less
beer
educated
people
theyll
love
its
high
drinkability
o
if
they
could
work
out
the
soap
taste
here
this
would
be
very
nice
well
i
thought
that
this
was
going
to
take
the
place
of
noble
pils
but
ive
now
learned
that
that
one
is
going
to
be
a
yearround
venture
thank
you
beerfmandy
for
the
correction
you
and
beerfm
know
everything
beer
drinkability
it
was
actually
really
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
very
nice
o
this
was
my
first
zwickel
or
keller
and
i
enjoyed
it
greatly
it
falls
somewhere
between
a
hefe
and
a
pils
and
fans
of
either
style
should
be
sure
to
try
this
sam

very
good

floral

as

from
sammy
a
go
patriots
i
had
this
on
tap
tonight
with
dinner
served
in
a
sa
perfect
pint
the
beer
is
a
murky
orange
small
white
head
minimal

the
aroma
is
grassy
herbal
the
beer
is
slightly
bitter
smooth
grassy
the
finish
is

it
drinks
very
easy
very
smooth
i
did
not
know
much
about
this
beer
smelled
and
tasted
like
a
pilsner
but
darker
i
like
the
unfiltered
aspect
imo
a
nice
addition
to
the
sa
lineup
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
german
lager
crisp
and
well
balanced
with
a
nice
lemon
flavor
o
a
clean
down
to
earth
beer
it
is
great
as
a
spring
seasonal
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
crisp
spring
morning
i
only
had
noble
pils
once
and
i
know
its
not
going
away
but
this
seems
to
be
a
great
replacement
im
glad
boston
beer
chose
an
underrepresented
style
and
made
an
approachable
but
not
dumbed
down
beer
american
owned
that
is
im
a
novice
to
craft
beer
but
have
found
sam
adams
brews
to
be
quite
good
namely
the
flagship
boston
lager
and
the
noble
pils
i
find
this
new
beer
to
be
the
perfect
change
of
pace
beer
i
dont
detect
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
again
my
tastebuds
are
just
learning
the
ways
of
craft
beer
and
i
put
my
trust
in
jim
koch
to
give
us
newbies
a
beer
we
can
enjoy
on
any
occasion
i
dont
know
this
beer
seems
to
be
lacking
in
the
taste
it
was
tasty
with
the
first
sip
or
so
but
then
the
taste
started
to
get
boring
a
very
nice
looking
beer
and
the
aroma
was
nice
those
were
really
the
only
good
attributes
to
this
brew
this
isnt
even
remotely
close
to
being
tasty
and
easy
drinking
as
noble
pils
not
a
total
waste
just
not
worth
the
hype
drinkability
highly
drinkable
perfect
springsummer
brew
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
is
wants
something
different
than
a
pale
lager
perfect
type
of
gateway
beer
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before

at
july
pours
translucent
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
of
sour
citrus
grains
and
slightly
floral
taste
is
alot
less
hops
and
alot
more
malt
than
i
expected
from
the
smell
bready
and
a
bit
sweet
with
some
lemon
peel
at
the
end
some
floral
hops
bitterness
but
not
much
light
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
i
am
noticing
somewhat
of
an
odd
floral
soapy
aftertaste
the
more
i
drink
it
overall
i
think
im
all
set
with
this
one
opinion
overall
i
have
been
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
i
would
be
nice
if
the
bottle
version
was
a
pleasing
to
look
at
as
it
was
on
tap
the
draft
version
kept
a
respectable
head
on
it
pretty
much
the
whole
glass
the
bottle
version
dropped
pretty
quickly
otherwise
i
like
the
showcase
of
hops
that
coexists
nicely
with
the
malt
in
the
finish
to
give
you
a
balanced
flavor
to
linger
long
after
the
sip
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
of
boston
brewing
companys
regularsessionable
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
so
far
very
refreshing
good
mix
of
clean
and
grainy
good
looking
and
went
down
very
smooth
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
this
for
sure
12oz

pours
a
hazy
yellow
body
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
persists
fruity
spicy
hops
dominate
the
aroma
orange
pineapple
and
spice
hit
the
palate
initially
with
pine
spice
and
citrus
pulp
notes
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
very
drinkable
pleasant
refreshing
and
tasty
i
like
this
one
o
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
i
think
i
could
get
into
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
crisp
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
a
slight
fruity
yeast
aroma
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
yeasty
flavor
that
compliments
a
solid
malt
bill
of
mainly
pilsner
malts
the
hop
character
is
mild
yet
lend
itself
nicely
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
refreshing
beer
i
like
the
unfiltered
yeast
character
the
esters
add
a
good
bit
of
depth
more
tropical
fruit
notes
with
citrus
splashes
light
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
stuff
will
make
a
decent
warm
weather
quaffer
as
soon
as
spring
officially
hits
not
bad
id
def
pick
up
a
sixer
or
two
of
this
in
the
future
m
very
little
carbonation
but
a
pleasant
medium
body
onot
a
bad
beer
at
all
really
and
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
taste
and
quality
of
the
beer
overall
meh
the
only
decent
quality
is
the
noble
hops
otherwise
weird
flavors
and
pretty
meh
it
almost
seems
like
they
took
the
summer
ale
and
noble
pils
and
blended
them
to
make
this
beer
although
it
is
fairly
drinkable
for
a
spring
beer
maybe
makes
sense
but
should
be
a
late
spring
beer
not
1
5
months
before
spring
beer
pretty
descent
has
that
classic
sam
adams
taste
fresh
tasting
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
getting
better
and
better
with
each
drink
pours
a
hazy
murky
yellowish
orange
with
a
1
finger
head
decent
lacing
a
nice
retention
smells
of
oranges
and
lemons
all
freshly
cut
a
touch
of
earthy
grain
and
banana
bread
also
lemons
on
the
tongue
nice
light
bready
malt
on
the
back
citrus
all
around
a
tad
lager
funk
to
boot
not
too
bad
lightmedium
in
body
and
feel
has
a
little
more
to
it
than
it
looks
overall
this
is
a
decent
leading
to
spring
lager
though
i
think
this
could
be
alot
better
if
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
prominent
sampled
on
january
30
2012
i
had
this
on
tap
at
an
olive
garden
restaurant
it
pours
into
a
frosted
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
but
very
foamy
light
to
medium
amber
the
aroma
is
of
malts
but
more
of
grains
and
all
in
all
rather
subtle
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
the
taste
is
also
more
on
the
grainy
side
but
it
finishes
clean
crisp
and
slightly
dry
it
is
not
too
bad
and
i
expect
it
will
be
popular
with
the
masses
this
spring
very
excited
to
try
this
oneespecially
after
a
rough
day
working
outdoors
in
the
rain
i
thought
alpine
spring
was
going
to
be
noble
pils
with
a
different
name
it
wasnt
but
theres
a
hint
of
it
in
this
brew
bartender
poured
into
a
pint
glass
while
i
eagerly
waited
for
the
foamy
head
to
reduce
to
quarter
inch
the
smell
of
lemon
was
evident
and
the
first
taste
was
thirst
quenching
i
could
taste
some
citrus
and
light
hops
this
brew
is
full
bodied
but
yet
light
on
flavor
carbonation
is
good
and
lacing
on
the
empty
pint
is
art
work
gotta
get
another
and
i
had
the
third
pint
when
my
food
arrived
this
is
my
session
beer
for
the
season
abv
is
5
5
but
its
hardly
noticeable
very
nice
brew
i
was
hopping
for
a
little
more
citrus
but
hey
this
thing
is
balanced
to
the
gill
nice
golden
color
full
of
carbonation
a
little
cloudy
look
very
inviting
smell
was
bout
average
notes
are
kinda
of
light
on
the
nose
taste
the
beer
is
perfect
with
the
balance
that
it
has
mouthfeel
smooth
clean
and
crisp
overall
a
great
spring
beer
fire
up
the
grills
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
half
inch
of
bright
white
foam
that
last
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
bright
spicy
hops
and
bready
malt
the
taste
is
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
a
ton
of
bready
notes
and
some
spicy
hops
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
keller
bier
that
i
can
see
becoming
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
while
it
is
in
season
o
its
nowhere
near
the
upper
echelon
of
the
sam
adams
portfolio
but
it
aint
half
bad
folks
if
youre
a
lemonycitrus
guy
or
gal
this
is
a
worthwhile
tick
not
one
ill
be
seeking
out
again
but
i
in
no
way
regret
spending
3
on
the
bomber

faint

note
nice
flavor
and

kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
bells

without
the
spicy
hop
notes
would
make
a
nice
late
spring
warmer
weather
brew
drinkabilityoverall
i
have
to
say
this
beer
was
an
enigma
to
me
and
i
still
wouldnt
fully
know
how
to
explain
it
to
someone
i
guess
partially
its
just
not
a
style
i
am
very
familiar
with
wouldnt
particularly
say
i
loved
drinking
it
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
almost
just
very
bland
and
simple
and
that
made
it
drinkable
if
not
totally
enjoyable
not
a
beer
i
will
revisit
but
worth
a
try
in
terms
of
uniqueness
alone
d
way
to
showcase
the
tettnanger
hops
their
bright
flavor
really
holds
this
one
down
jim
and
the
boys
have
made
some
amazing
german
style
beers
lately
and
i
hope
they
keep
em
comin
o
easy
to
drink
beer
that
will
definitely
be
fantastic
on
those
nice
cool
spring
days
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
like
noble
pils
does
but
this
is
a
fine
spring
seasonal
beer
frankly
lots
of
smaller
breweries
will
release
spring
seasonal
lagers
that
are
much
worse
than
alpine
spring
lightly
toasted
bread
and
honey
notes
up
front
sweetish
with
faint
fruit
notes
bright
zesty
peppery
hops
dive
in
and
provide
a
very
refreshing
lift
the
hops
become
more
floral
and
herbal
with
light
bitterness
finish
is
moderately
dry
with
lingering
honey
bread
dough
malts
mediumbodied
with
a
very
creamy
smooth
feel
one
of
the
creamier
lagers
ive
had
maybe
due
to
the
unfilteredness
very
drinkable
and
would
make
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
will
buy
more
as
spring
gets
nearer
overall
good
probably
perfect
in
summer
and
though
refreshing
not
dull
or
thin
oi
love
this
style
but
i
think
sam
adams
once
again
missed
the
point
the
grassyness
is
there
which
i
love
however
there
are
some
off
flavors
there
and
a
weird
creaminess
that
makes
this
beer
taste
more
like
some
light
american
ale
than
a
true
german
lager
ill
give
it
another
shot
im
sure
not
completely
turned
off
yet
o
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
further
explore
the
keller
bierzwickel
bier
style
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
great
with
food
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
that
i
would
have
again
this
poured
out
with
and
impressive
hazy
orange
color
with
a
very
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
and
retention
on
this
beer
were
very
good
as
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
citrusy
lager
like
aromas
that
are
interesting
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
citrusy
start
to
it
with
some
nice
refreshing
qualities
the
finish
is
similar
to
a
wheat
beer
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
a
soft
well
carbonated
and
drinkable
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
unfiltered
pale
yelloworange
coloring
with
a
sparse
coating
of
film
good
solid
lacing
along
the
glass
as
the
beer
moves
around
aromas
are
very
light
with
a
slight
lemon
zest
and
clove
spicing
but
not
much
of
anything
else
flavors
are
roasty
and
toasty
with
a
grainy
cereal
backbone
and
some
extremely
subtle
hops
and
citrus
tones
the
hops
take
over
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
dry
peppery
profile
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
with
a
hint
of
cloves
left
behind
aromas
and
palate
are
weak
overall
but
the
body
and
finish
are
well
put
together
could
be
a
good
beer
with
a
liitle
more
oomph
on
the
palate
murkey
strawlike
color
with
a
moderately
sized
head
the
aroma
is
restrained
clean
but
some
grass
and
grain
a
touch
of
yeast
and
pale
malt
the
beer
is
flavorful
and
fresh
a
little
tart
there
is
a
little
fruit
in
the
flavor
orange
and
apple
but
its
essentially
a
clean
beer
mediumlight
in
body
the
beer
has
a
notable
malt
sweetness
that
continues
through
the
taste
not
much
hop
bitterness
or
flavor
just
a
little
for
balance
alpine
spring
succeeds
in
retaining
good
hop
flavor
while
staying
light
and
crisp
perfect
to
drink
while
eating
or
enjoying
anything
outdoors
seriously
a
great
hopforward
taste
with
the
clean
crispness
of
a
lager
yes
please
overall
an
all
around
decent
lager
but
for
some
reason
im
just
not
digging
this
one
if
you
absolutely
have
to
by
all
means
pick
one
up
and
give
it
a
try
personally
i
dont
plan
on
revisiting
this
brew
anytime
soon
cheers
a
nice
mix
of
hefeweizen
and
lager
with
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
citrusy
and
enjoyable
first
adventure
into
the
keller
bierzwickel
bier
style
so
if
alpine
spring
is
true
to
form
then
i
think
ill
enjoy
this
style
and
seek
out
more
of
these
beers
on
tap
as
part
of
the
world
beer
tour
a
10oz
pour
was
golden
straw
with
a
white
foam
cap
mild
citrus
nose
a
bit
of
lemon
taste
was
citrusy
orangelemon
honey
fruity
hops
clean
finishing
almost
but
not
quite
juicy
mediumlight
yet
creamy
body
higher
carbonation
refreshing
pretty
good
overall
a
decent
beer
though
not
one
that
i
would
revisit
in
the
future
absolutely
perfect
i
just
which
the
aroma
was
slightly
more
prominent
picked
up
a
bottle
at
euro
market
i
get
a
little
kick
of
fruity
hops
in
the
opening
of
the
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
it
comes
off
like
smooth
bready
dortmund
export
lager
its
a
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
short
white
head
its
clean
and
nice
enough
but
not
distinctive
meh
i
want
to
like
this
beer
but
just
cant
get
excited
about
it
overall
light
and
refreshing
with
a
perfect
mouthfeel
for
this
type
of
beer
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
or
oomph
but
few
can
take
the
helles
zwickel
bier
and
make
it
really
great
so
cant
knock
it
much
an
interesting
style
for
the
brewery
to
tackle
but
i
dont
think
it
hit
the
style
spot
on
my
first
6
pack
will
be
my
last
o
like
a
lot
of
sams
not
bad
drinkable
but
definitely
left
me
wanting
more
flavor
and
especially
aroma
im
not
sure
if
it
is
fair
to
compare
this
to
noble
pils
but
np
is
head
and
shoulders
above
this
beer
clean
and
refreshing
in
the
taste
as
well
sweet
then
tart
like
lemons
there
is
a
grassy
taste
as
well
that
gives
it
that
clean
refreshing
side
decent
little
bite
of
hops
in
the
back
that
give
the
sweettart
thing
some
balance
wheaty
malts
that
create
a
solid
backbone
subtly
complex
despite
the
refreshing
qualities
with
a
nice
balance
througout
juicy
in
the
middle
and
dry
in
the
finish
effervescent
texture
near
the
end
from
a
higher
carbonation
this
is
a
good
one
from
bbc
and
a
welcome
addition
to
their
seasonal
lineup
overall
i
thought
that
was
a
pretty
average
beer
since
i
have
never
had
this
style
before
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
what
i
got
was
a
little
boring
and
didnt
keep
me
entertained
i
dont
know
if
this
was
a
bland
attempt
at
the
style
or
if
they
are
suppose
to
be
like
that
it
did
have
some
pretty
good
drinkability
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
would
make
a
pretty
refreshing
summer
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
right
now
it
just
doesnt
hold
my
attention
and
make
me
want
to
grab
another
bottle
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
fit
this
beer
nicely
and
was
just
what
it
should
be
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
bland
flavor
and
aroma
and
the
lack
hops
mainly
of
the
citrus
variety
if
it
had
some
more
hops
it
would
help
balance
out
all
those
dominating
bready
malts
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
it
just
doesnt
stick
out
to
me
if
you
want
a
smooth
easy
drinking
warm
weather
beer
this
may
make
a
good
choice
but
to
me
it
isnt
that
interesting
this
beer
was
very
middle
of
the
road
with
nothing
about
it
being
memorable
as
a
whole
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
years
brewers
choice
pack
all
the
new
beers
seemed
pretty
lackluster
and
its
safe
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
old
beers
in
this
pack
more
then
the
new
beers
i
guess
i
was
just
expecting
more
from
their
brewers
choice
pack
i
hope
the
next
one
turns
out
better
o
i
have
never
had
a
lager
like
this
before
it
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
by
the
pool
overall
head
retention
suffered
from
the
hop
oxidation
and
each
quaff
brings
back
the
skunked
impression
again
will
need
furthur
tastings
to
give
a
final
recommendation
hazy
strawyellow
to
orange
color
with
plenty
of
thick
creamcolored
head
and
good
retention
pleasantly
malty
aroma
of
bread
caramel
and
grains
with
a
nice
touch
of
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
exceedingly
smooth
a
touch
sweet
up
front
with
notes
of
lemon
coriander
and
floral
hops
the
finish
is
drier
and
deliciously
malty
medium
body
just
a
tad
too
sweet
i
thought
otherwise
a
pretty
great
beer
for
sam
adams
and
it
definitely
blows
their
last
spring
selection
out
of
the
water
this
is
an
excellent
lager
and
a
really
unique
style
well
done
sam
adams
something
i
highly
recommend
id
have
no
problem
knocking
a
few
of
these
unfiltered
lagers
back
out
on
the
porch
on
a
hot
sunny
day
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
12
head
ans
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
lemons
dough
and
other
citrus
the
flavor
has
lemon
honey
and
straw
notes
with
a
smooth
balanced
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
samuel
adams
alpine
spring
is
a
good
beer
a
good
session
beer
recommended
cheers
as
advertised
a
citrusy
sweet
unfiltered
lager
would
like
a
little
more
bitterness
to
balance
but
overall
a
proficient
execution
of
what
bbc
was
trying
to
do
this
brew
is
all
right
but
kind
of
americanized
for
the
style
perhaps
better
as
a
wheat
beer
with
a
malted
wheat
base
instead
of
pilsner
malt
i
rather
like
the
beer
as
its
flavorful
zesty
and
boldly
spiced
with
hops
while
allowing
for
a
nearly
sessionable
ability
the
orange
grass
mint
and
thin
caramel
taste
makes
me
think
pale
ale
and
want
something
more
sampled
in
january
2012
despite
being
labeled
a
spring
seasonal
release
regardless
of
weather
conditions
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
will
certainly
be
buying
more
of
these
alpine
spring
is
a
solid
helles
lager
although
i
will
miss
the
noble
pils
i
know
its
year
round
now
but
how
many
bars
have
a
sam
seasonal
tap
as
the
only
good
choice
i
will
still
be
happy
to
drink
the
spring
seasonal
taste
is
sweet
rich
and
fruity
i
get
more
tones
of
honey
than
anything
else
though
somehow
not
as
light
as
id
have
liked
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
balance
here
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
o
i
am
usually
a
huge
fan
of
sa
lagers
and
while
i
did
enjoy
this
one
it
is
probally
my
least
preferred
of
the
bunch
the
honey
malt
detracts
from
this
beer
in
my
opinion
it
covers
up
the
base
malt
flavors
which
are
my
favorite
part
of
pale
lagers
if
they
booted
the
honey
malt
and
maybe
added
a
little
more
base
malt
i
have
no
doubt
i
would
love
this
beer
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
a
quick
drinking
really
smooth
perfect
reflection
of
the
style
and
im
once
again
pleased
with
a
samuel
adams
brew
nice
light
citrus
hop
up
front
bit
of
a
sweet
malty
body
to
it
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
aftertaste
overall
an
excellent
beer
perfect
for
a
day
riding
around
on
the
lawnmower
flavor
is
simpler
with
a
sweet
citric
start
then
a
bit
butteryhoney
like
in
the
middle
yet
finishing
rather
dry
and
with
a
fair
hop
spice
to
it
carbonation
keeps
well
through
the
glass
feel
is
decent
for
what
its
trying
to
be
and
a
bit
fuller
than
many
a
german
styled
lager
atmosphere
is
really
good
here
great
appearance
with
a
great
head
including
a
nice
residual
good
color
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
basic
but
a
nice
grain
flavor
pretty
basic
too
but
wellbalanced
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
makes
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
t
starts
off
with
light
hops
at
the
forefront
several
seconds
later
a
prominent
buttery
flavor
develops
along
with
the
wheatbase
profile
quite
surprising
and
notes
from
the
previous
commentators
suggest
that
the
twowave
thing
is
universally
detectable
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
not
very
complex
but
the
change
in
flavor
will
keep
you
interested
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
from
a
brewery
id
never
really
been
too
impressed
by
before
served
from
bottle
into
a
mug
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
banana
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
spices
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
okay
brew
nothing
on
this
one
really
bashed
me
over
the
head
where
i
needed
to
go
back
for
sip
after
sip
but
it
was
quite
easy
drinking
there
were
no
harsh
flavors
going
on
here
which
made
it
easy
to
drink
just
wish
there
would
have
been
a
little
more
to
it
to
push
it
to
the
next
level
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance

overallvery
refreshing
light
and
flavorful
i
will
pick
up
more
of
this
for
spring
o
as
with
most
sam
adams
beers
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
good
choice
on
tap
at
those
restaurants
that
only
have
macros
and
sam
adams
seasonal
o
a
real
good
job
by
samuel
adams
here
clean
and
great
tasting
i
loved
noble
pils
but
i
think
this
is
a
more
than
adequate
switch
over
taste
is
very
carbonated
and
sharp
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
nice
malty
honey
flavors
dominate
which
is
pretty
nice
overall
its
decent
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
noble
pils
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
classic
style
overall
pretty
good
brew
surprisingly
rich
and
interesting
on
tap
i
got
very
slight
hints
of
a
hop
character
but
it
honestly
tasted
like
an
unbalanced
popcorn
lager
i
would
have
liked
more
sweetness
and
slickness
but
dried
corn
overall
better
than
i
was
expecting
very
sessionable
a
good
replacement
for
noble
pils
i
think
this
one
will
do
well
for
ladies
who
like
lightertasting
brews
and
the
men
who
follow
along
their
mountain
paths
i
like
this
beer
overall
it
goes
beyond
the
classic
pils
quaulities
yet
stays
within
the
parameters
oddly
enough
worth
checking
out
like
it
i
do
overall
very
drinkable
and
i
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
rotation
i
hope
there
is
some
left
this
spring
so
i
can
enjoy
it
when
i
fire
up
the
grill
i
really
appreciate
the
thought
that
went
behind
this
concept
beer
as
it
is
a
melding
of
some
of
my
favorite
german
styles
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
appreciates
a
beer
with
superb
balance
character
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
pours
a
nice
medium
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
excellent
retention
and
a
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
bready
malts
with
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
body
is
medium
and
carbonated
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
bursts
of
sweettart
fruit
through
out
crisp
but
earthy
finish
liked
it
a
lot
o
a
nice
offering
for
spring
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
think
i
will
be
drinking
more
this
spring
o
approachable
and
drinkable
this
would
be
nice
of
a
cool
spring
day
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
beefed
up
kolsch
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
profile
with
a
neutral
flavored
malt
if
i
go
back
to
the
brickhouse
again
i
will
definately
seek
this
beer
out
but
i
cant
image
it
would
be
as
good
in
a
bottle
typical
of
sam
adams
this
beer
looks
good
on
paper
but
fails
in
execution
yeast
profile
on
this
is
typically
unclean
sam
adams
lager
profile
with
a
slightly
tart
estery
taste
and
finishes
a
little
cloying
as
if
grains
of
paradise
or
other
spices
were
used
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
indian
coriander
with
froot
loops
like
citrus
dominating
malt
profile
is
a
little
biscuity
which
is
welcome
to
offset
the
tartness
and
citrus
profile
but
ends
up
coming
off
oddly
weird
unclean
and
unrefreshing
might
be
a
decent
summer
beer
why
the
hell
you
would
release
it
in
january
is
beyond
me

second
foray
into
this
beer
not
much
has
changed
added
to
the
description
gave
a
slight
bump
into
smell
and
overall
and
thats
about
it
this
is
an
easydrinking
lager
interesting
mix
of
styles
within
the
lager
family
that
works
well
nice
use
of
tettnang
hops
o
good
a
nice
spring
bock
if
only
theyd
released
it
in
april
or
may
maybe
id
buy
a
sixer
of
it
instead
of
the

that
i

o
really
enjoyed
sam
adams
newest
seasonal
offering
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
wish
i
hadnt
just
picked
one
from
a
mixsix
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
was
too
style
so
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
to
report
its
unoffensive
and
very
easy
to
drink
tan
to
slightly
orange
hazy
1
finger
head
with
some
staying
power
pretty
good
lacing
smells
of
grains
malts
plenty
of
citrus
and
some
nice
hops
taste
is
pretty
bold
on
the
citrus
with
a
good
bready
malty
backbone
and
a
nice
light
hop
profile
some
sweet
honey
fullness
brings
home
the
nice
and
surprisingly
full
body
a
very
tasty
surprise
ill
certainly
have
this
one
again
pours
a
rich
golden
color
soapy
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
bready
with
a
lager
yeast
strain
evident
in
the
taste
grainy
sweet
cereal
notes
and
some
lemony
citrus
mild
noble
hop
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
lingers
on
the
palette
easy
to
drink
but
overall
pretty
average
o
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
i
prefer
the
noble
pils
to
this
spring
seasonal
a
good
beer
to
have
with
some
spring
cleaning
i
will
say
overallvery
refreshing
i
could
have
several
pints
of
this
i
love
the
sweet
and
slightly
piney
combo
this
is
very
smooth
this
may
be
their
best
spring
seasonal
yet
it
smells
and
tastes
like
this
beer
has
almost
the
same
hop
and
malt
profile
as
noble
pils
grassy
hops
dominate
the
aroma
and
taste
i
feel
like
the
malt
bill
is
a
bit
more
developed
here
in
contrast
with
np
thicker
in
body
still
grainy
but
also
a
bit
sweeter
clean
all
around
excellent
drinkability
and
flavor
a
winner
from
sa
love
a
new
sam
brew
this
ones
okay
not
as
good
as
the
white
ale
o
admittedly
i
had
low
expectations
for
it
but
this
was
a
delicious
simple
beer
feels
mildly
carbonated
with
a
medium
mouth
feel
o
c
i
guess
its
a
party
beer
for
me
drink
some
in
the
sun
etc
like
a
lot
of
sam
adams
stuff
poured
a
2
velvety
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
body
is
a
little
hazed
but
bright
golden
yellow
theres
really
not
a
whole
lot
of
smell
and
although
i
do
get
the
citrus
its
not
the
most
obvious
of
citrus
beers
the
taste
to
me
doesnt
deviate
that
far
from
bmcs
not
too
complex
some
faint
citrus
per
the
label
and
a
crisp
lager
finish
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
just

very

great
palate
very
good
for
style
and
rather
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
little
to
early
on
the
mrket
this
is
a
killer
spring
beer
o
a
pretty
much
unremarkable
lager
from
sa
not
great
not
terrible
somewhat
refreshing
but
nothing
i
would
ever
buy
again
on
a
side
note
i
remember
sas
old
spring
ale
tasting
a
lot
like
this
minus
the
dish
soap
overall
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
bit
higher
alcohol
content
and
more
flavor
savory
smells
and
tastes
then
the
typical
refreshing
beer
say
the
typical
american
lager
i
think
i
would
very
much
enjoy
this
come
spring
after
a
nice
meal
while
sitting
outside
at
a
picnic
table
despite
all
the
label
claims
and
descriptors
that
would
make
one
thing
this
is
anything
but
traditional
i
e
such
a
unique
maverick
type
of
beer
i
found
it
to
be
exactly
what
i
expected
a
decent
sa
beer
as
part
of
a
variety
12
pack
that
would
be
relatively
mild
in
all
aspects
purchased
ina
mixed
case
however
i
was
curious
and
would
have
purchased
a
sixer
or
single
bottle
to
try
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
crispness
well
carbonatd
cloudy
orange
in
appearance
foam
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
not
a
factor
slightly
sweet
but
not
too
noble
hops
may
have
tamed
that
slightly
liked
the
unfiltered
part
maybe
not
a
january
beer
but
very
tasty
and
would
dring
anytime
first
time
i
believe
i
have
experienced
the
tettnang
hops
overall
a
good
go
to
beer
this
to
me
tastes
like
a
lager
version
of
their
summer
ale
which
im
not
real
fond
of
it
doesnt
state
that
theres
actually
any
lemon
in
it
but
it
sure
tastes
that
way
definitely
more
of
a
summertime
offering
in
my
opinion
this
was
a
huge
surprise
from
samuel
adams
im
generally
a
fan
of
most
of
their
offerings
and
am
always
excited
to
try
something
new
from
them
for
me
this
is
a
welcomed
spring
seasonal
although
were
seeing
it
in
january
but
thats
another
discussion
that
ill
be
sure
to
grab
a
sixpack
of
for
the
appropriate
weather
o
this
would
be
a
perfect
spring
summer
beer
i
really
dont
get
why
this
came
out
in
january
but
i
actually
really
enjoy
this
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
from
this
beer
it
came
in
the
variety
pack
with
some
other
good
stuff
but
some
okay
stuff
but
honestly
this
beer
is
much
better
then
i
thought
it
would
be
the
unfiltered
aspect
of
it
makes
it
similar
in
some
ways
to
a
hefeweizen
and
the
nose
of
it
is
actually
a
bit
similar
too
sort
of
a
citrus
lemony
honey
type
of
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
actually
very
much
like
honey
i
feel
like
for
5
5
this
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
and
hits
the
spot
carbonation
is
well
suited
for
the
style
i
would
say
this
is
on
the
upper
tier
of
some
of
the
sam
adams
stuff
i
have
had
im
not
blown
away
here
i
dont
think
this
is
a
go
to
beer
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
i
think
it
will
go
over
well
with
noble
pils
fans
overall
this
is
just
tolerable
it
would
be
better
if
the
brewer
had
picked
a
style
and
stuck
with
it
sort
of
a
duckbilled
platypus
of
a
beer
i
cant
say
im
terribly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
is
a
fine
sessionable
lager
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
i
dont
take
much
from
the
nose
just
smells
like
a
pilsner
grainy
and
dry
taste
is
snappy
and
bright
citrus
notes
and
bready
upfront
with
a
dry
honeysweet
finish
overall
a
great
light
spring
beer
that
i
would
recommend
o
not
really
digging
this
one
at
all
not
too
bad
for
a
simple
lager
but
not
great
it
seems
like
in
trying
to
incorporate
the
characteristics
of
three
different
german
styles
it
got
muddled
i
cant
help
but
compare
it
to
noble
pils
which
i
much
preferred
pretty
light
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
beer
smooth
and
watery
o
this
is
interesting
not
what
you
expect
in
a
munich
helles
lager
it
seems
like
it
would
be
better
as
a
summer
season
not
a
spring
seasonal
that
debuts
before
martin
luther
king
day
not
bad
but
not
good
enough
either
it
seems
like
they
were
trying
to
make
a
lighter
version
of
helles
to
appeal
to
a
select
audience
beer
is
grainy
and
harsh
with
a
rough
cereal
finish
mildly
hoppy
thin
on
the
back
strong
aftertaste
corny
not
really
feeling
this
one
mouthfeel
mediumlight
body
light
carbonation
crisp
texture
o
the
beer
has
a
very
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
and
has
some
flavors
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
maibock
o
while
i
will
miss
the
usual
sa
spring
offering
the
spring
ale
from
the
last
few
years
this
is
a
solid
helles
offering
and
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
also
would
make
more
sense
in
the
springsummer
verses
a
january
release
o
i
cannot
wait
to
buy
a
case
of
this
when
it
was
gone
i
wanted
more
i
could
drink
5
or
six
of
these
i
wasnt
even
planning
to
review
it
but
i
had
to
after
i
drank
it
sooo
good
i
would
buy
this
yearround
hinthint
bbc
overall
alpine
spring
is
nice
and
easy
on
the
palate
id
like
a
bit
bolder
flavor
and
maybe
a
bit
fuller
texture
it
is
however
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
few
of
with
friends
on
the
back
porch
once
released
in
the
proper
i
e
spring
season
easy
drinking
a
balanced
beer
a
bit
filmy
on
the
end
it
was
a
tasty
beer
but
one
i
would
call
nothing
more
than
an
introduction
to
the
style
i
have
long
been
unsatisfied
with
sam
adams
spring
offering
this
year
they
have
turned
it
around
alpine
spring
is
the
perfect
beer
to
get
you
from
the
dark
full
bodied
beer
that
is
winter
lager
to
the
light
citrusy
taste
of
sam
summer
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
i
really
like
it
hoppy
front
and
clean
citrus
back
its
safe
to
say
that
sam
an
i
will
have
a
second
date
before
summer
loving
begins
a
good
session
beer
o
this
is
another
quality
beer
and
i
wouldnt
expect
less
the
noble
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
mixed
with
the
citrus
provides
for
a
really
good
spring
beer
notes
aroma
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
all
a
little
off
the
hops
are
too
floral
the
mouthfeel
is
too
grainy
the
taste
is
not
pleasant
wont
repeat
this
one
i
take
my
hat
of
to
bbc
since
they
managed
to
produce
a
beer
that
comes
close
to
what
i
might
call
a
home
brew
or
true
small
batch
taste
im
not
sure
what
quantities
they
produce
for
this
beer
but
they
have
done
a
good
job
in
giving
it
that
craft
brew
taste
my
bottles
were
particularly
fresh
and
fresh
tasting
this
is
january
so
i
doubt
there
was
much
heat
damage
or
light
damage
to
the
ones
i
sampled
good
glass
lacing
as
well
o
i
really
think
this
is
more
of
a
zwicklbier
than
a
munich
helles
lager
because
this
is
a
tad
yeastier
and
brighter
than
most
authentic
helles
lagers
still
for
an
unfiltered
lager
its
not
bad
and
one
has
to
applaud
the
boston
beer
company
for
attempting
to
market
such
an
odd
beer
to
mainstream
drinkers
light
body
and
medium
carbonated
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
way
off
on
the
category
i
dont
mind
pushing
style
boundaries
but
this
is
very
similar
tasting
to
noble
pils
good
beers
both
but
its
not
a
helles
the
malt
is
on
but
the
hops
is
a
little
out
of
control
for
the
style
more
of
a
zoigl
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
hazed
orange
glow
kellerbier
style
lager
light
colored
head
slightly
off
white
fine
even
lacing
texture
is
great
creamy
foam
all
day
aroma
has
a
sturdy
hop
character
with
fresh
cut
grass
citrus
zest
and
herbal
notes
as
well
mineral
water
floral
spring
notes
with
a
wave
of
biscuits
freshly
baked
light
golden
crisp
drizzled
with
a
touch
of
honey
malt
sugars
a
pretty
sweet
and
malty
lager
up
front
with
some
citrus
and
finishes
with
biscuit
malts
and
honey
sweetness
really
maibock
like
in
the
flavor
i
miss
the
dry
noble
hops
and
a
bit
lighter
body
this
one
has
more
girth
to
it
than
the
last
spring
seasonal
there
has
to
be
a
low
level
of
hop
bitterness
im
guessing
20
to
25
tops
on
the
ibus
carbonation
is
smooth
and
yeast
flavor
tends
to
stick
around
between
sips
since
its
pretty
much
suspended
in
the
beers
appearance
overall
a
fine
springsummer
seasonal
that
is
being
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
smack
in
the
middle
of
a
big
ol
january
snowstorm
why
not
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
huge
airyfrothy
shape
holding
head
beautiful
lacing
aroma
is
super
bright
smells
like
a
warm
weather
brew
smell
is
lightly
floral
and
grassy
with
lemon
peel
the
taste
is
pleasant
enough
with
some
floral
hops
and
citrus
but
overall
id
say
this
is
too
sweet
overall
flavor
could
be
more
interesting
this
is
a
munich
helles
lager
that
pretty
much
tastes
like
a
blue
moon
so
helles
means
bright
huh
well
this
is
bright
too
bright
the
malt
aspect
is
there
just
kinda
flavorless
and
sweet
feel
is
a
tad
thin
this
might
be
refreshing
if
it
were
summer
its
definitely
not
summer
not
bad
tho
overall
this
is
a
home
run
from
sam
adams
there
arent
that
many
helles
lagers
brewed
domestically
and
this
is
a
style
that
simply
does
not
travel
well
so
having
one
available
fresh
is
great
many
smaller
breweries
simply
dont
have
the
capacity
and
necessary
equipment
to
give
enough
time
to
age
a
well
made
lager
so
this
is
something
sam
adams
definitely
has
an
advantage
with
the
bbc
does
a
great
job
with
lagers
and
this
is
an
excellent
addition
to
their
lineup
pours
a
foggy
yellowgold
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
fills
the
glass
to
the
brim
before
dropping
to
a
solid
covering
floral
noble
hop
aroma
upfront
with
some
grass
over
a
bit
of
pale
honeylike
malt
nice
german
hop
flavor
grass
hay
and
zesty
citrus
and
some
doughy
yeast
not
so
much
in
the
malt
department
light
bodied
dry
and
very
quaffable
this
is
a
fine
spring
seasonal
from
sam
adams
that
i
wouldnt
find
seeing
yearround
file
this
one
under
kellerbier
o
this
german
style
unfiltered
pilsner
is
a
far
cry
from
what
were
all
used
to
from
sam
adams
but
its
a
nice
solid
change
you
still
get
the
constructed
put
together
aspect
of
sam
adams
rather
than
letting
the
ingredients
work
naturally
but
i
enjoyed
the
attempt
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
overall
drinkability
a
good
relaxing
beer
a
nice
session
odi
like
noble
pils
better
this
is
a
mediocre
substitute
i
enjoyed
the
nose
a
bunch
but
the
actual
flavor
let
me
down
a
bit
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
far
from
it
actually
but
i
immediately
toss
this
one
into
the
large
bag
of
sam
adams
beers
that
are
unmemorable
mediocre
and
uninspired
i
hope
this
isnt
the
replacement
for
sas
nobel
pils
that
would
be
sad
do
this
beer
has
a
little
more
appeal
than
a
punchsoaked
dough
ball
but
otherwise
the
comparison
is
apt
it
heralds
few
of
the
refreshing
qualities
one
might
expect
from
a
beer
themed
for
spring
and
nowhere
is
that
more
evident
than
in
the
lifeless
smell
malt
is
the
focus
here
but
bready
yeast
surprises
by
also
finishing
ahead
of
the
minor
hop
qualities
do
not
expect
in
this
beer
another
freshcrisp
americancraft
pilsner
like
noble
pils
even
lighter
lagers
have
range
on
the
malt
continuum
and
this
one
seems
to
oppose
that
other
beer
this
american
made
lager
is
nothing
less
than
just
a
good
clean
beer
i
hope
this
becomes
a
year
around
brew
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
and
is
a
really
nice
drinker
for
a
spring
beer
o
a
decent
brew
that
might
taste
better
as
the
weather
warms
up
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
easy
drinking
and
have
some
mainstream
appeal
with
the
light
sweet
malt
flavors
but
a
bit
disappointing
when
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hoppy
citrusy
lager
i
dont
want
to
beat
it
up
to
bad
it
is
fairly
close
to
style
just
needs
a
hops

glad
to
see
another
new
and
delicious
sam
adams
lager
sure
its
not
the
crisp
hopfest
that
noble
pils
was
but
its
a
fantastic
wellbalanced
lager
all
on
its
own
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
bright
gold
in
color
with
an
ever
so
slight
cloudiness
and
a
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
feature
a
mix
of
must
slight
honey
pale
malts
and
an
ever
so
slight
hop
bitterness
its
ok
nothing
stellar
and
doesnt
give
off
crisp
or
fresh
aromas
the
flavors
feature
the
same
flavors
that
the
aromas
provided
in
the
taste
you
get
more
honey
and
pale
malt
with
very
little
bitterness
its
kind
of
bland
there
is
some
light
citrus
though
it
drinks
light
bodied
and
smoothly
but
id
prefer
more
of
a
crisp
bite
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
average
for
the
style
it
doesnt
really
differentiate
itself
from
german
beers
of
the
same
style
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
a
medium
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
apricot
bread
and
lightly
sweet
malts
surprisingly
good
aroma
for
a
lager
the
taste
is
really
beautiful
not
too
sweet
with
grain
and
floral
hops
as
the
primary
taste
nice
spicy
finish
would
prefer
a
little
dryer
finish
but
the
palate
is
clean
in
less
than
a
minute
texture
is
very
nice
light
body
with
a
creamy
finish
mediumlow
carbonation
an
excellent
offering
and
really
rather
unique
the
closest
cousin
in
the
samuel
adams
lineup
is
the
summer
ale
the
summer
ale
has
the
grains
of
paradise
and
is
more
lemony
both
are
refreshing
and
different
i
love
the
unfiltered
characteristic
in
this
lager
its
a
hit
with
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
lager
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
great
spring
session
beer
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
gold
a
half
inch
of
white
head
leaves
some
lace
smell
is
tangerine
grass
clove
and
a
touch
of
honey
taste
is
that
with
a
big
zest
of
pine
and
lemon
in
the
finish
body
is
good
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
nice
carbonation
and
very
refreshing
i
like
it
will
definitely
have
on
draft
this
winter
still
prefer
the
pile
but
this
is
solid
good
beer
and
will
definitely
be
an
easy
seller
crisp
and
refreshing
kind
reminds
you
of
fresh
laundry
decent
though
i
picked
this
up
at
the
hyvee
build
a
sixpack
i
was
impressed
with
the
3
fingers
of
foam
that
almost
overflowed
my
glass
it
went
downhill
from
there
the
aroma
was
a
mix
of
grain
and
grass
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
just
confusing
theres
a
small
wheat
element
with
some
orange
but
theres
some
odd
dryness
to
it
that
i
found
rather
offputting
like
they
threw
some
dust
in
the
kettle
the
body
is
good
for
the
style
and
has
a
crispness
to
it
im
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
overall
very
tasty
almost
reminds
me
of
a
triple
with
the
floralness
of
hops
and
the
pale
malts
this
is
pretty
impressive
for
sam
adams
a
beer
full
of
flavor
and
character
impressed
would
buy
agian
beauiful
creamy
head
on
this
beer
nicely
capping
a
pale
golden
but
hazy
colour
underneath
nose
is
quite
appetizing
with
miscellaneous
floral
and
herbal
notes
palate
offers
some
slightly
sweet
malt
flavors
and
a
nice
zinging
hop
profile
to
round
it
out
medium
bodied
and
amazingly
drinkable
reviewing
to
style
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
very
tasty
beer
that
would
fit
nicely
in
the
late
springearly
summer
but
is
tasting
just
fantastic
in
early
january
as
well
would
be
a
real
nice
bbq
beer
shit
bring
this
and
noble
pils
for
the
day
and
you
are
set
pours
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
moderate
fluffy
head
scent
if
rather
grainy
with
a
lot
of
earthy
tones
with
some
mild
citrus
the
taste
has
a
strong
unfiltered
characteristic
as
you
take
in
a
blend
of
semibitter
hops
crisp
malts
and
floral
hints
i
found
this
to
be
more
of
a
slower
sipping
beer
than
most
of
their
other
beers
due
to
the
complex
taste
and
texture
from
the
unfiltered
process
complex
unique
and
delicious
o
overall
this
is
a
wellmade
highly
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
great
representation
of
the
helles
style
there
are
aspects
that
remind
me
of
sns
summerfest
but
the
sn
is
more
rounded
and
clean
in
flavor
while
the
graininess
in
this
beer
is
appetizing
it
deters
me
from
a
higher
rating
due
to
how
the
beer
is
being
advertised
a
home
run
gotta
love
perks
of
the
job
especially
sample
bottles
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
gold
topped
by
maybe
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
heavy
bread
yeast
hanging
over
light
lemon
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
comes
in
pretty
similarly
though
the
yeast
is
now
joined
and
somewhat
cut
by
some
wheat
very
lagery
as
some
might
say
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
the
flowers
really
come
through
big
time
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
a
simple
but
highly
enjoyable
little
spring
drinker
right
on
sam
adams
mild
and
bready
light
grassy
bitterness
lemon
and
doughy
yeast
flavors
lightly
dry
residual
bitterness
that
hangs
around
for
a
few
moments
light
bodied
slightly
fuller
feel
due
to
the
added
yeast
smooth
feel
easygoing
carbonation
something
id
drink
again
though
noble
pils
is
still
a
favorite
overall
drinkability
good
all
around
no
major
flaws
could
be
a
bit
more
refreshing
taste
falls
apart
for
me
the
honeyed
malt
falls
squarely
in
between
a
watery
floral
hop
flavor
and
a
flabby
bitterness
at
the
end
the
taste
overall
has
no
flow
and
is
a
total
trainwreck
of
a
beer
i
rarely
have
trouble
finishing
a
sixer
of
anything
but
this
one
i
was
happy
to
be
able
to
pawn
off
two
of
the
six
bottles
and
will
surely
never
ever
buy
this
atrocity
again
shame
on
you
bbc
if
this
replaces
the
noble
pils
i
will
be
sorely
disappointed
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
creamy
looking
head
slight
lacing
the
smell
is
citrusy
some
herbal
hop
smells
in
there
like
a
pilsner
also
has
a
sweet
smell
from
the
malts
the
taste
has
a
tangy
citrus
flavor
with
some
herbal
notes
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
hmm
finish
can
be
a
bit
dry
as
well
interesting
anyway
mouthfeel
is
kinda
prickly
from
the
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
but
not
too
remarkable
wish
they
would
have
taken
a
bolder
route
and
had
the
whitewater
ipa
as
their
spring
seasonal
this
beer
is
too
much
like
their
summer
seasonal
whether
this
is
a
noble
pils
replacement
or
not
i
hope
that
i
enjoy
it
next
year
and
not
be
disappointed
with
it
as
i
was
noble
pils
the
second
time
around
overall
whats
the
point
of
seasonals
when
the
spring
comes
out
7
days
into
winter
at
least
they
put
it
on
the
self
and
not
waiting
collecting
dust
aging
in
the
distro
warehouse
had
a
bottle
sample
of
this
at
work
the
other
nighti
guess
its
taking
the
spring
seasonal
spot
next
year
with
the
noble
pils
becoming
year
around
poured
lighter
hazed
golden
with
a
well
formed
12
finger
sticky
white
head
atop
some
honey
malt
in
the
nose
and
that
is
basically
itfaint
lemon
as
well
sweetish
honey
flavors
at
the
onset
with
some
firm
toasted
grain
flavorsa
smattering
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
with
faint
lemon
not
bad
i
think
it
is
a
good
selection
for
a
spring
seasonalits
lighter
but
with
a
little
substance
drinkability
is
awesome
on
alpine
spring
it
is
a
great
beer
for
springtime
it
has
some
really
good
tastes
and
flavors
to
it
but
they
all
balance
out
really
well
the
balance
makes
this
an
awesome
session
beer
sam
really
did
well
with
this
new
seasonal
super
carbonated
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
it
has
a
light
fruit
character
like
berries
without
the
sweetness
grain
cereal
and
it
has
this
earthy
kind
of
twist
to
it
not
too
bad
at
least
its
interesting
i
used
to
love
this
pils
but
it
now
tastes
like
a
homebrew
thats
gone
off
it
was
very
foamy
with
large
bubbles
and
i
poured
it
down
the
sink
i
hope
this
was
a
bad
bottle
but
at
9
for
four
i
took
it
back
i
will
try
it
in
the
future
and
hope
for
better
luck
we
will
crack
open
another
bottle
and
edit
the
review
if
needed
interesting
and
i
kept
going
back
and
forth
on
whether
i
liked
it
the
doughy
nature
turned
me
off
a
little
glad
i
tried
it
o
fantastic
across
the
board
this
beer
is
quite
a
summer
treat
thats
refreshing
and
delicious
nope
the
body
is
fineeven
bordering
on
the
rich
side
good
carbonation
very
bittertoo
bitter
for
the
style
not
that
im
complaining
little
malt
id
describe
this
as
a
layered
ipa
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
hope
ba
corrects
the
style
big
thanks
goes
out
to
drabmuh
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
past
trade
as
an
extra
served
from
bottle
into
a
grolsch
pilsner
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
wheat
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
wheat
spice
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
for
the
style
it
was
actually
pretty
nice
i
could
see
this
being
a
really
nice
poolside
brew
during
a
hot
summer
day
the
fruit
character
in
this
one
was
a
nice
addition
for
sure
and
made
it
quite
enjoyable
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
from
this
style
overall
one
damn
refreshing
beervery
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
beerin
the
warmer
months
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
o
its
light
crisp
tasty
and
has
a
low
abv
that
and
its
quasilocal
for
me
its
a
winner
on
all
accounts
o
might
be
my
new
favorite
domestic
pils
really
nice
beer
d
nice
and
refreshing
clean
yet
lightly
spicy
would
be
great
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summers
day
very
drinkable
eta
upon
rereview
im
not
changing
any
ratings
but
would
reiterate
my
wholehearted
endorsement
of
this
particular
suds
creation
its
damn
excellent
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
cant
get
it
in
cans
in
the
medina
lake
tx
area
for
my
fishin
trips
with
my
brother
its
really
a
fishin
beer
and
you
guys
should
sell
it
in
cans
pours
a
hazy
hay
colored
yellow
with
a
lovely
cream
head
that
lingers
like
an
unwanted
guest
aroma
is
light
herbal
spice
thyme
and
rosemary
mixed
with
a
fresh
cut
grass
scent
flavor
is
clean
with
a
tiny
tiny
hop
kick
that
disappears
before
you
even
notice
its
there
the
poundability
of
this
beer
is
pretty
high
and
its
great
for
a
nice
warm
sunny
late
spring
day
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
medium
light
this
beer
is
very
good
quality
beer
lots
of
flavor
but
really
light
very
solid
pils
great
nose
and
solid
taste
hoppier
than
most
pils
not
that
im
complaining
o
its
good
to
have
a
local
poolside
beer
that
tastes
this
good
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
only
victory
prima
pils
was
better
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
at
one
sitting
and
its
a
wonderful
warm
weather
beer
overall
keller
pils
is
a
very
nice
american
interpretation
of
a
german
pilsener
i
would
take
this
over
some
of
the
german
imports
becks
warsteiner
of
the
same
style
great
aroma
with
an
almost
equally
good
taste
leaves
very
little
to
be
desired
overall
an
excellent
brew
a
wonderful
interpretation
of
a
german
pilsener
with
clear
american
craft
influence
hv
pale
somewhat
hazy
straw
in
color
decent
grassy
and
slight
citrus
aromas
very
dominant
hop
biteblend
of
bitterness
and
floral
qualities
nice
mouthfeeldry
in
the
finish
a
damn
good
beer
very
drinkable
for
the
size
of
the
bite
i
was
expecting
more
hops
in
here
but
this
is
still
well
done
nice
to
see
this
back
again
as
well
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
the
nose
was
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
wasnt
half
bad
either
overall
a
really
nice
american
brewed
german
pilsner
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
good
summer
refresher
for
sure
drinkability
5
this
is
smooth
and
tasty
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
beer
im
digging
this
its
very
unique
and
doesnt
seem
all
that
much
like
a
lager
but
then
again
this
isnt
your
average
lager
drinkability
its
been
a
loooonng
time
tuppers
hows
the
family
hows
the
wife
paired
fairly
well
with
a
bowl
of
lentil
soup
with
andouille
sausage
i
love
this
beer
on
first
tasting
it
took
me
back
50
years
to
the
great
old
fashioned
pils
of
the
upper
midwestgrain
belt
glueks
schells
schmitts
fitgers
cold
springaromatic
with
a
lingering
full
taste
medium
carbonated
medium
hopped
without
the
overhopped
micro
brews
of
today
or
the
light
tasting
overcarbonated
brews
like
olympia
leinekugel
hamms
coors
that
put
grain
belt
and
the
others
out
of
business
this
is
a
fantastic
beerthe
best
i
have
had
in
europe
or
north
americamexico
in
50
years
tastewise
vey
hoppy
and
dry
i
supped
this
with
some
sushi
and
it
was
a
good
pairing
too
much
awfulness
to
even
finish
it
i
rarely
leave
a
beer
unfinished
but
i
wanted
to
quickly
move
on
to
something
that
i
liked
d
goes
down
very
nice
with
that
crisp
dryness
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
leaves
you
wanting
more
representative
of
german
keller
pils
will
and
have
purchased
again
some
facts
found
on
the
bottle
this
is
contract
brewed
by
st
george
brewing
company
in
hampton
va
and
half
of
their
profits
go
to
support
charitable
institutions
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
made
this
beer
very
drinkable
its
smooth
crisp
mouthfeel
made
the
beer
quite
refreshing
and
a
nice
session
beer
to
have
on
a
summer
beer
miscategorized
here
even
by
the
description
on
the
label
it
appear
to
be
considered
a
keller
bier
and
from
what
i
am
seeing
and
tasting
it
matched
the
description
on
this
site
closely
rating
it
as
such
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
lighter
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
very
grainy
with
a
dry
lemony
flowery
bite
that
will
surprise
making
this
a
crisp
summer
time
treat
a
definite
six
pack
recommendation
and
dry
and
grainy
by
style
while
still
being
balanced
with
enough
hops
of
pale
ale
proportions
that
should
keep
the
tongue
parched
for
more
easy
to
down
and
finely
crafted
incredibly
drinkable
beer
delicious
and
is
the
best
of
the
3
new
pilsners
ive
tried
today
even
beating
out
the
impressive
southampton
keller
pils
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
aromas
of
tasty
honey
and
a
pile
of
mixed
citrus
skins
flavors
are
big
on
a
lemon
freshness
with
a
distinctly
honeyish
malt
sweetness
and
a
distant
grassiness
finishes
with
strong
notes
of
lemon
zest
wellbalanced
and
very
refreshing
quite
a
nice
pilsener
one
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
drinkability
very
drinkable
overalll
a
really
solid
and
nice
tight
little
ale
would
have
no
issue
with
try
this
one
again
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
easy
drinking
spritzy
along
the
palate
and
an
excellent
companion
to
many
meals
that
would
jump
out
id
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
mixed
case
of
this
and
the
hop
pocket
for
the
summer
solid
easy
drinking
pils
that
still
stands
out
even
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
where
great
pilsners
are
a
notch
above
12
oz
bottle
from
dyan
thanks
the
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
frothy
inch
tall
head
thats
fed
by
ample
carbonation
big

aroma

light
herbal
notes
and
a
clean

profile
hop
dominated
palate
noble
in
character
with
big
signature
herbal
and
grassy
notes
i
suppose
this
is
what
a
german
pils
would
taste
like
if
it
were
dry
hopped
some
of
the
malt
flavor
is
lost
in
the
mix
amounting
to
little
more
than
a
thin
bready
foundation
for
the
hop
flavors
quite
good
though
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
american
brewed
pilsners
ive
had
in
a
while
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
its
a
pretty
nice
example
of
the
style
definitely
one
of
the
more
bitter
and
hoppy
versions
of
the
style
that
ive
had
at
least
a
pretty
good
pilsner
with
some
nice
hop
flavors
though
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
that
ive
had
d
a
decent
pils
but
nothing
crazy
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hops
in
the
smell
and
taste
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
i
would
give
it
another
shot

this
is

im
floored

thoroughly
drinkable
despite
the
114pack

im
going
to
drink
a

of
this
over
the
summer
beer
is
pretty
thin
and

cleanly
with
a
mild
aftertaste
again
a
little
bit
of
sulfur
its
not
as
sweet
as
youd
expect
from
the
aroma
its
quite
sessionable
and
possible
to
drink
quickly
and
often
a
good
lawnmower
beer
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
at
the

of
the
palate
overall
its
decent
d
other
than
the
unpleasant
taste
this
is
pretty
good
not
sure
why
there
is
such
a
huge
disconnect
between
taste
and
aroma
theres
potential
here
but
something
has
gone
wrong
in
the
execution
perhaps
the
contract
brewing
has
screwed
things
up
this
guy
came
highly
recommended
trust
me
it
did
now
to
see
if
it
lives
up
to
the
expectations
thrust
upon
it

golden
straw
with
about
a

so
of

head
it
could
just
be
my
overused
glass
but
a
slow
but
steady
stream
of
bubblies
makes
its
way
from
the
base
to
the
surface
gravity
be
damned
a
lovely
bit
o
millstone
lacing
is
eventually
constructed
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
usual
bitter
florals
come
off
of
the
surface
and
into
the
strils
joined
by
an
undistinguishable
fruitiness
this
fruitiness
is
sadly
lost
on
the
tongue
which
finds
itself
quickly
awash
with
hoppy
bitterness
which
is
itself
tempered
by
strong
florality
this
slight
dichotomy
makes
up
nearly
the
entirety
of
the
taste
proof
of
the
styles
elegeant
simplicity
the
body
is
quite
light
and
summery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
liquid
feel
a
fine
example
of
a
generally
tasty
pilsener
something
that
hasnt
crossed
my
path
all
that
often
d
highly
drinkable
this
will
certainly
become
part
of
my
regular
summer
rotation
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
medium
body
excellent
drinkability
the
persistent
rumors
of
the
demise
of
the
hop
pocket
beers
seem
to
be
true
for
now
glad
to
try
this
one
while
its
still
available
as
good
a
pils
as
there
is
recommended
d
wildly
drinkable
a
great
summer
beverage
that
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
also
give
this
flavorful
pilsner
to
a
regular
bmc
to
show
them
what
a
drinkable
lager
should
taste
like

have

a
pilsner
that
tasted

this

there
is
a
unique
flavor
to
this
that
made
me
question
if
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
or
not
while
not
unpleasant
the
aroma
and
taste
is
unique
to
anything
i
have
tried
thus
far
so
it
had
me
reaching
for
ways
to
describe
it
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
appearance
especially
the
staying
power
of
that
abundant
head
and
the
continuing
carbonation
overall
pretty
good
this
is
not
really
a

it

its

the

that
is
about

i
enjoyed
the

is
thin

the

too
much
funk
for
me
there
is
a
hint
of
honey
and
some
grassy
notes
but
i
just
found
this
beer
sorely
lacked
flavour
i
will
say
that
this
is
only
the
second
kellerbier
ive
ever
had
so
im
not
exactly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
wasnt
for
me
a
decently
malty
lager
with
that
default
bavarian
bready
character
nothing
complicated
but
very
easy
to
drink
which
puts
it
right

i
prefer
the
look
of
the
unfiltered
version
of
this

the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
starts
out
with
a
slightly
malty
flavor
but
finishes
clean
and
crisp
mouth
feel
is
pretty

but
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
palate
cleanser
if
you
were
eating
a
meal
with
it

im
not

fan
but
my
exceptions
are

sweet

slightly
skunked

and
thats

it

wet

taste
begins
with
bright

yet
distinct
german
noble
flavor
hops
giving
way
to
a

character
and
wet

sack
the
finish
is
soft
and
wet
with
more
of
the
lingering
sweet
huskiness
but
towards
the
middle
of
the
bottle
it
becomes
irritating
bittering
hops
are
delicate
a
decent
beer
but
tends
to
become
bothersome
over
time
pours
a

with
a
good

head
that
finally
settled
down
to
around
5mm
after
a
good
while
i
even
poured
it
very
slowly
most
i
have
seen
i
believe
a
good
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
like
a
good
german
brew
that
was
fresh
on
tap
the
aroma
is
only
of
malts
and
yeast
for
the
most
part
pretty
much
the
same
is
said
for
the
taste
with
just
a
very
light
finish
of
hops
wasnt
overdone
at
alll
and
actually
just
added
some
character
to
this
brew
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
this
german
style
of
beer
either
but
was
really
good
mediumbottled
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
great
brew
prost
and
best
wishes
for
2015
i
still
think
the
price
point
to
quality
ratio
of
some
of
these
german
beers
is
profoundly
awesome
this
bottle
was
less
than
five
bucks
a
much
thicker
denser
german
brew
than
i
am
used
to
here
hazy
with
yeast
sediment
and
a
flat
looking
tan
orange
hue
the
beer
is
real
heady
white
and
bubbly
and
lasting
german
malty
flavor
here
with
a
warm
yeast
character
and
a
speck
of
brown
sugar
in
the
finish
its
definiely
grain
driven
but
there
is
a
light
bittering
hop
in
the
finish
with
the
sweetness
of
the
grain
that
balances
well
and
the
beer
feels
quite
light
for
how
dense
it
looks
creamy
texture
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
help
that
its
maybe
not
the
most
dynamic
malt
profile
in
german
brewing
but
its
definitely
unlike
american
made
beers
in
the
same
style
and
i
quite
like
it
different
than
what
i
am
used
to
a
beer
that
has
a
little
bit
of
characternice
maltiness
on
the
forefront
of
taste
with
a
little
hoppy
kick
in
the
end
while
ive
enjoyed
other
kellerbiers
more
than
this
one
this
good
be
a
good
start
for
someone
who
wants
this
type
of
lager
but
likes
a
little
hops
to
be
apparent
overall
nice
lagerbock
beer
also
know
as

will
be
revisiting
this
one
again
in
the
future
o
not
a
bad
beer
would
be
great
to
talk
over
with
friends
would
purchase
this
beer
again
o
really
nice
on
warm
evening
outside
having
said
that
this
keller
beer
did
show
some
character
especially
when
it
warmed
up
overall
i
like
it
it
was

light
body
sets
the
foundation
for
this
brew
malts
even
making
for
a
bit
of
chewiness
along
with
the
crispness
somehow
though
it
does
still
manage
to
flow
smoothly
it
would
be
wrong
if
the
feel
was
clean
and
this
beer
really
pulls
out
the
light
body
with
the
texture
left
with
maturity
and
lack
of
pasteurization
or
filtration
first
one
for
the
style
for
me
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
cmpare
it
with
but
i
think
it
was
a
good
one
very
true
to
type
this
mediumbodied
kellerbier
is
a
nice
way
to
enjoy
a
fall
or
winter
evening
proof
that
bayerisches
reinheitsgebot
allows
for
quite
a
bit
of
variety
an
alright
zwickel
but
not
good
enough
for
me
to
go
seeking
out
again
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
hits
the
spot
if
you
are
looking
for
something
smooth
with
moderate
flavor
i
e
not
wanting
a
hop
bomb
recommend
if
you
can
get
it
especially
since
this
is
one
of
the
rarer
styles
and
hard
to
find
i
know
been
trying
for
several
yrs
new
to
tx
market
rotation
would
like
to
try
ontap
at
least
once
not
sure
if
id
buy
again
in
bottle
unless
the
mood
struck
me
o
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
away
but
a
very
solid
choice
for
a
lager
tasty
and
just
interesting
enough
i
would
recommend
it
o
i
enjoyed
this
kellerbier
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
offers
rich
and
complex
flavors
of
malts
in
the
taste
m
very
smooth
carbonation
is
modest
allowing
this
beer
to
go
down
easy
overall
this
is
a
nice
one
would
definitely
buy
again
try
with
a
bit
of
celery
salt
sprinkled
limburger
and
the
yeast
in
this
beer
takes
on
a
lactic
ice
creamlike
aftertaste
c
taste
again
yeast
and
dark
malts
are
in
large
supply
lightly
fruity
just
a
little
bit
juicy
im
immediately
reminded
why
i
like
kellerbiers
that
yeast
really
brings
a
lot
of
flavor
notes
an
interesting
beer
inside
and
out
a
nice
lager
all
the
way
cheers
overall
a
nicely
complex
beer
with
lots
of
little
nuances
that
develop
as
it
warms
o
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
is
definitely
a
forgettable
one
awesome
kellerbierfull
of
flavor
and
character
while
retaining
the
refreshing
smooth
characteristics
youd
expect
from
a
lager
charming
and
delicious
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
mild
spicy
malt
aroma
rich
caramel
taste
with
a
thick
feel
mild
carbonation
medium
sweet
dark
fruit
taste
has
a
sweet
start
but
finishes
clean
with
little
negative
aftertaste
this
is
an
alright
brew
but
not
too
exciting
t
perfect
body
not
so
light
not
so
heavy
good
taste
to
malt
and
a
little
burn
bread
nice
bitterness
for
the
style
i
have
very
little
experience
with
kellerbiers
and
that
could
be
why
this
didnt
blow
me
away
overall
its
well
rounded
flavourful
and
very
very
refreshing
i
have
some
work
to
do
in
appreciating
a
well
made
lager
and
until
i
fully
do
im
comfortable
with
my
review
of
this
beer
taste
confirms
the
richness
of
this
beer
a
great
keller
beer
had
a
glass
at
the
trapp
door
in
emmaus
pa
the
malt
was
smoother
than
other
kellerbiers
or
pilsners
more
like
a
vienna
lager
with
a
light
caramel
bready
barley
character
i
dont
get
any
of
the
yeasty
or
earthy
notes
of
most
kellerbiers
but
i
do
like
the
subtle
spicy
floral
hop
character
that
sink
in
to
the
finish
aside
from
the
hops
this
beer
doesnt
resemble
the
style
much
but
its
a
fine
lager
worth
trying
very
disappointing
it
tasted
stale
and
very
homebrewgonebad
smelled
a
bit
yeasty
and
was
cloudier
than
should
be
poor
aftertaste
again
this
stale
blech
finish
i
shouldve
known
there
was
an
issue
when
it
was
on
sale
at
kaufland
for
8
euro
for
a
case
of
20
x
5
liter
bottles
dont
waste
your
time
as
there
are
sooo
many
other
more
interesting
aleskeller
biers
o
another
classic
keller
i
dont
know
why
more
breweries
dont
do
this
style
their
sure
fun
to
drink
o
for
a
beginners
kellerbier
this
could
be
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
but
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
way
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
murky
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
receded
to
almost
nothing
leaving
little
to
no
lace
bready
aroma
with
caramel
malts
yeast
and
some
honey
sweetness
smooth
malt
taste
grassy
with
flavors
of
toasted
bread
caramel
honeyroasted
peanuts
and
a
nice
floral
quality
coming
through
midway
and
maybe
a
touch
of
orange
nice
and
smooth
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
od
i
could
definately
session
this
nice
and
drinkable
and
very
soft
subtle
and
tasty
i
liked
this
alot
nice
and
different
complexities
you
can
taste
the
minerals
in
the
water
in
this
one
just
a
great
change
in
style
and
great
balance
in
flavors
go
for
it
o
very
nice
beer
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
light
i
like
this
beer
very
much
it
has
a
little
more
flavor
than
a
pure
quencher
like
stoudts
gold
not
the
best
keller
ive
had
but
as
far
as
bottled
versions
go
its
okay
notes
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
d
high
moderate
alcohol
great
flavor
excellent
nose
all
delivered
without
any
irritating
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
day
an
excellent
example
of
kellerbier
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
despite
the
slightly
unbalanced
character
of
the
hops
i
can
imagine
enjoying
this
with
a
spicy
meal
using
the
hops
bitterness
to
my
advantage
to
cut
through
a
stronger
flavor
d
this
is
a
very
nice
keller
bier
glad
this
one
showed
up
in
town
this
week
its
not
bad
would
have
liked
a
little
more
flavor
very
malty
beer
wellmade
brew
i
dont
have
a
ton
of
experience
with
kellerbier
but
i
enjoyed
this
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
ive
enjoyed
sipping
and
id
be
quite
happy
to
have
this
one
again
while
id
not
give
it
top
marks
overall
it
has
a
nice
drinkability
and
id
not
hesitate
to
have
another
rather
elegant
and
intriguing
but
easy
to
drink
sampled
at
beer
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
a
solid
keller
without
much
of
a
broadness
in
flavor
or
i
would
say
just
lean
qualities
are
there
mild
funk
of
something
tight
on
the
palate
apple
nose
pilsner
brisk
and
floral
pollen
sweetness
palate
is
just
that
exactly
better
a
bit
warmer
recently
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
is
good
to
develop
a
rubric
understanding
its
a
tad
dark
orange
cloudy
but
at
best
a
tangy
pilsner
to
the
oblivious
not
as
wheat
based
bright
as
ive
had
not
at
tangy
very
happy
to
explore
this
style
more
a
very
good
beer
but
i
would
not
make
an
effort
to
score
some
more
thanks
mum
d
nothing
too
grand
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
one
if
you
come
on
one
do
try
though
this
one
just
was
not
as
much
for
me
but
not
bad
at
all
poured
from

delicious

a
great

pours
a
clouded
hazed
amber
hue
with
off

fine
coated

left
between

aroma
is
a
bit
flat
not
much
going
on
semi
malt
bready
tones
a
bit
of
a
nutty
edge
to
it
with
the
yeast
sediment
doesnt
taste
off
just
a
bit
dated
stale
non
lively
brew
going
on
a
touch
of
caramel

crispness
to
it
nutty
yeast
grassy
finish
pretty
boring
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
soft
and
smooth
nothing
crazy
here
pretty
forgettable
stuff
here
go
find
another
fresh
german
lager
to
compare
this
with
one
of
my
favorites
a
lageresquepils
like
highly
drinkable
beer
that
stays
in
the
traditional
german
manner
nothing
too
fancy
or
complex
just
a
grand
beer
for
beers
sake
a
hazy
bright
copper
yellow
pour
with
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lace
behind
a
nice
fresh
bread
mild
caramel
malt
aroma
with
freshcut
hay
and
a
minute
amount
of
hops
clean
fresh
and
brisk
with
a
light
body
and
a
basic
flavor
of
simple
malt
balanced
by
bitter
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
you
want
more
of
nothing
special
or
complex
just
done
right
the
mouthfeel
really
shines
for
me
its
soft
and
smooth
delicate
and
chuggable
great
lager
fill
up
the
bucket
and
pass
it
over
here
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
very
nice
it
was
crisp
and
light
but
balanced
the
kellerbau
pours
a
light
ambercopper
color
not
much
lacing
lines
the
glass
but
the
head
is
white
and
pillowy
some
noticeable
sediment
from
the
unfiltered
german
lager
smell
is
musky
with
some
hints
of
bready
doughs
and
yeast
taste
is
slightly
watery
with
a
sweet
finish
quaff
is
made
up
of
caremel
and
toffee
with
little
grainy
tastes
mouthfeel
is
thin
bodied
and
watery
drinkability
is
mediocre
this
is
really
lacking
in
the
taste
and
aromas
categories
will
skip
on
this
in
the
future
d
i
found
it
to
be
exceptional
paired
with
spicy
food
d
you
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
tire
of
it
is
it
session
worthy
absolutely
however
its
nothing
thats
going
to
impress
the
hell
out
of
you
just
a
solid
easy
drinking
rare
brew
this
beer
is
thin
and
bland
not
what
i
expected
at
all
seriously
this
beer
is
practically
water
there
is
a
slight
wheat
flavor
at
the
end
but
only
if
i
hold
the
beer
in
my
mouth
for
a
long
time
my
palate
is
either
zapped
which
it
should
be
or
this
beer
is
bland
high
drinkability
very
quenching
overall
not
impressed
copper
in
color
with
an
impressively
longlasting
head
buttery
and
somehow
wholesome
to
smell
full
of
fresh
bread
and
honey
plus
some
floral
hop
tones
and
a
bit
of
cracked
grain
deliciously
honeyed
flavor
full
sweet
bready
and
spicy
toffee
waltzes
with
bitter
lemon
rind
to
a
score
of
popcorn
caramel
and
herbs
soft
yet
crisp
malty
yet
dry
simple
yet
elegant
d
not
on
par
with
the
other
kellerbier
ive
had
still
a
decent
brew
just
kinda
uninteresting
i
expect
a
more
nuanced
flavor
from
something
barrel
aged
mild
and
easy
drinking
i
could
do
this
all
day
not
knowing
it
was
what
it
is
aside
from
some
peaks
in
the
aroma
drinkability
when
i
think
of
german
biers
i
usually
picture
something
with
a
bit
more
kick
to
it
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
the
style
i
go
for
this
would
be
great
for
summer
picnics
or
barbecues
with
the
inlaws
where
your
more
interested
in
hydration
and
food
than
sitting
down
and
studying
a
beer
and
doing
some
research
on
it
not
a
favorite
but
definitely
not
a
drainpour
either
d
a
simple
yet
very
tasty
beer
indeed
pours
muddy
pond
water
into
my
glass
greenish
brown
and
cloudy
totally
unappealing
borderline
gross
the
nose
is
fruity
with
notes
of
toffee
the
flavor
is
soft
and
inviting
like
the
nose
toffee
maybe
a
touch
of
caramel
then
there
is
a
fruity
quality
with
a
kiss
of
spiced
hop
bitterness
nuanced
and
delicate
just
enough
carbonation
and
bitterness
to
make
it
balanced
a
hint
of
sourness
keeps
it
interesting
worthwhile
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
my
first
beer
of
this
style
nice
but
i
would
have
liked
higher
hop
presence
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
thick
malt
character
it
does
not
have
the
honey
sweetness
of
a
pilsner
or
the
fruity
caramel
thickness
of
a
bock
but
instead
it
has
a
doughy
biscuit
flavor
that
coats
the
palate
the
malt
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
it
has
a
certain
zen
elegance
and
the
beer
seems
to
disappear
rather
quickly
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
nose
is
attractive
in
this
beer
consisting
of
sweet
malt
and
pepper
the
beer
has
no
more
then
moderate
sweetness
on
the
palate
and
it
finishes
somewhat
light
and
dry
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
light
and
actually
a
bit
watery
although
there
is
still
what
i
would
call
plenty
of
flavor
in
this
beer
alcohol
is
no
more
then
an
afterthought
in
this
beer
and
so
drinkability
is
exceptional
very
nice
stuff
here
freshish
500ml
swingtop
pours
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
eventually
disappears
to
leave
nice
lacing
smells
strongly
of
wet
hay
and
grain
sweet
malt
primarily
with
some
grassiness
big
very
grainy
almost
bready
taste
plenty
of
aromatic
hop
character
without
all
of
the
bitterness
surprisingly
strong
yeast
notes
for
a
lager
rich
and
characterful
full
body
and
carbonation
that
suits
it
brilliantly
the
kind
of
thing
one
could
drink
all
day
hazy
dirty
copper
color
minimal
and
fleeting
off
white
head
and
lacing
caramelly
honeyish
bready
nutty
malt
aromas
follow
through
on
the
taste
but
this
lacks
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
finishes
sweet
light
to
medium
in
body
smooth
slick
mouthfeel
from
the
too
light
carbonation
becomes
cloying
rather
quickly
diminishing
drinkability
overall
it
is
a
good
refreshing
darker
lager
and
i
am
eager
to
try
a
more
highlyesteemed
kellerbier
d
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
but
not
one
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
given
session
its
quite
filling
almost
like
liquid
bread
mfd
what
affects
this
beers
drinkability
is
that
it
is
simply
to
sweet
to
keep
drinking
i
would
be
happy
with
a
maßkrug
of
this
guy
but
i
would
stop
drinking
it
after
that
that
would
be
enough
the
body
is
mediumlight
a
bit
more
on
the
medium
side
carbonation
is
light
but
not
lacking
i
have
a
feeling
this
style
is
not
supposed
to
be
too
extreme
in
any
manner
drinks
okay
despite
some
big
flaws
i
love
kellerbiers
but
this
one
either
had
a
rough
crossing
or
got
the
shit
kicked
outta
of
it
here
approach
with
caution
i
will
rereview
if
i
can
find
confirmed
fresh
product
this
could
just
be
a
bad
bottle
this
beer
is
an
o
g
original
gravity
d
one
of
those
brews
where
the
smell
is
decidedly
more
interesting
than
the
taste
the
complexity
of
the
nose
is
undermined
by
the
lack
of
integration
of
the
hops
and
malt
in
my
opinion
solid
atmosphere
great
head
especially
has
that
kinda
raw
unclean
nose
and
palette
to
it
overall
really
good
quaff
mouthfeeldrinkability
wow
this
might
be
the
smoothest
beer
i
have
had
in
some
time
low
carbonation
is
what
does
it
and
it
works
well
i
could
have
many
of
these
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
abv
is
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
is
refreshing
it
is
a
decent
keller
if
you
are
looking
to
try
one
d
this
is
a
decent
brew
complex
enough
to
have
a
couple
but
the
maltiness
would
probably
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
that
to
be
honest
i
only
bought
this
beer
for
the
swing
tops
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
looks
decent
has
a
cloudy
deep
orange
color
to
it
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
smell
is
decent
has
a
nice
malty
aroma
to
it
with
a
suptle
hop
kick
taste
is
mild
an
easy
drinking
reminds
me
of
sale
a
warsteiner
dunkel
or
other
mild
german
dark
beers
kinda
bockish
its
a
decent
beer
maybe
ill
start
buying
these
over
grolsch
to
bottle
my
homebrew
i
wouldnt
really
pay
another
5
for
one
of
these
but
it
was
worth
a
shot
to
try
the
style
its
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
a
helles
and
a
marzen
unfiltered
pretty
good
and
drinkable
just
overpriced
the
mönchshof
range
produced
by
kulmbacher
is
generally
very
good
but
i
reckon
their
kellerbräu
is
my
favourite
it
has
a
darker
more
amber
appearance
than
the
other
kellerbiers
ive
sampled
but
this
just
reflects
its
maltiness
although
its
clearly
on
the
malty
side
the
taste
isnt
too
sweet
or
overpowering
it
goes
down
very
well
and
its
got
a
mildly
spicy
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
firstclass
keller
md
not
the
most
delicious
kellerbier
ive
tried
yet
the
quiet
but
consistently
yeasty
flavour
profile
with
a
late
entry
of
hoppiness
makes
this
beer
somewhat
highly
drinkable
ive
got
a
crash
on
this
style
of
beer
recently
and
this
bottle
surely
hasnt
disappointed
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
persistent
creamy
foam
extremely
light
and
subtle
aromas
almost
imperceptible
malt
and
nutlike
flavors
are
in
a
similar
vein
very
subtle
but
gradually
develop
a
richness
and
complexity
that
never
overpowers
this
is
the
closest
to
a
session
beer
you
can
get
with
very
clean
and
refined
flavors
i
was
impressed
with
the
labels
depiction
of
the
tonsured
rotund
monk
admiring
a
stein
of
beer
if
only
life
was
really
like
that
this
beer
is
a
great
surprise
and
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
so
far
its
passively
eloquent
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
sample
bottled
on
an
exceptionally
good
day
or
if
this
beer
is
always
so
nice
but
i
will
definitely
try
it
again
its
sessionable
but
maybe
with
power
of
suggestion
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
still
after
dampened
expectations
this
emerges
to
be
an
enlightening
surprise
wellcrafted
indeed
definately
enough
going
for
this
to
sit
on
for
a
while
fine
balance
shamelessly
drinkable
i
consider
this
an
excellent
session
beer
had
a
bottle
of
it
at
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
murky
browngold
appearance
with
a
really
good
lacing
aromas
were
complex
with
a
good
balance
of
malts
hops
slight
grassy
tones
and
some
citrus
generally
yeasty
taste
with
a
good
sweet
flavor
punch
to
it
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
but
helped
make
the
drink
somewhat
refreshing
overall
a
solid
beer
i
thought
this
a
very
pleasant
beer
not
great
but
above
average
for
the
style
and
price
i
paid
in
germany
while
on
a
beer
run
d
a
good
session
beer
1st
kellerbier
ive
tried
pours
a
murky
river
water
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
golden
color
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
i
was
not
expecting
a
lager
to
be
this
dark
so
this
was
indeed
a
nice
surprise
aroma
is
faint
and
a
little
funky
there
is
a
bland
breadiness
quality
mixed
in
with
some
grassy
aroma
mouthfeel
is
decent
watery
yet
crisp
i
cant
complain
the
flavor
is
decent
slightly
sweet
with
the
bread
quality
rounded
out
by
some
light
malts
drinkable
but
not
very
exciting
its
a
decent
brew
a
very
interesting
brew
a
lager
with
some
raw
wild
character
the
mouth
is
smooth
with
subtle
carbonation
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
i
would
recommend
you
try
it
at
least
once
the
taste
is
bready
and
leafy
with
a
little
rootbeerlike
spiciness
and
hint
of
caramel
along
with
hints
of
pine
and
lemon
its
also
a
little
zesty
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
refreshing
and
mildly
rich
brew
with
solid
concentration
and
an
easy
going
character
that
the
growler
keeps
nice
and
fresh
cheers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
small
white
head
i
was
rather
surprised
by
the
smell
smells
of
ale
yeast
and
malt
taste
however
has
the
characteristic
german
pilsner
yeast
flavor
with
a
smooth
dry
malty
backbone
the
hops
balance
the
maltyness
nicely
and
impart
a
slight
grassy
flavor
carbonation
is
medium
and
smooth
quite
a
drinkable
beer
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
run
of
the
mill
german
lager
one
of
the
best
german
beers
i
have
had
this
is
the
first
keller
bier
i
have
had
but
i
must
say
i
enjoy
the
style
a
lot
the
only
downside
was
that
the
price
was
kind
of
high
for
a
single
pint
of
beer
but
the
bottle
is
cool
and
collectible
i
guess
after
following
the
mahrs
kellerbier
this
one
is
handsdown
better
a
hazy
golden
hue
shows
colors
of
rust
and
straw
a
foamy
head
reatains
well
and
laced
well
later
in
the
session
aromas
of
heavy
pilner
malts
show
light
signs
of
fruitiness
and
vegitables
reminescent
of
more
bohemiantype
lagers
flavors
of
clean
caramelized
pilner
malts
shine
with
more
sweetness
and
fruitiness
than
expected
apples
and
pears
make
up
the
soft
ester
profile
a
grassy
herbal
hop
flavor
is
also
present
at
midpalate
and
gain
intensity
into
the
finish
quite
bready
and
yeasty
in
flavor
as
well
softly
carbonated
for
a
heavy
slightly
oily
feel
otherwise
clean
and
refreshing
brew
id
gladly
take
another
salud
note
you
have
to
swirl
the
bottle
around
to
get
all
of
the
yeast
chunks
off
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
to
resuspend
the
yeast
sediment
adds
complexity
and
assertiveness
and
complements
the
mineral
and
cookie
flavors
with
some
ripe
fruit
d
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
gulp
down
though
for
the
price
point
i
would
have
liked
some
more
complexity
to
make
this
one
worth
sipping
on
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
it
takes
the
clean
malts
and
spicy
hops
of
german
beers
and
amps
them
up
a
bit
but
not
so
much
as
to
create
something
too
complex
medium
bodies
and
tasty
high
drinkability
good
beer
been
looking
forward
to
cracking
this
one
open
spring
is
in
the
air
and
figured
this
was
the
perfect
time
pours
a
dark
rusty
brass
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
white
head
and
a
diminutive
lacing
all
around
the
pilsner
glass
a
sweet
malty
base
is
topped
off
by
the
smell
of
some
oats
and
grass
tastes
of
caramel
mixed
with
tealeaves
and
distant
hops
mouthfeel
is

slightly
bitter
carbonation

great
little
lager
here
drinkability
while
this
is
a
good
drinker
the
underlying
sweetness
from
the
malts
would
put
me
off
it

a
while

not
bad
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
once
in
a
while
d
a
lovely
example
of
the
style
comparable
to
the
hacker
pschorr
offering
which
i
am
partial
to
aswell
a
fantastic
session
beer
not
overly
stimulating
flavour
wise
but
a
good
honest
hearty
brew
that
can
be
drunk
litre
after
litre
without
complaint
d
overall
a
nice
cleanly
brewed
lager
with
a
good
fresh
fruitiness
to
it
swingtop
pours
a
hazed
amber
body
with
a
generous
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
sheets
of
delicate
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
mingling
with
floral
and
spicy
german
hops
smooth
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
taste
is
toasty
and
earthy
with
a
solid
caramel
backbone
complexity
comes
from
a
vague
fruitiness
and
the
spicy
and
herbal
hop
bitterness
this
would
be
very
sessionable
if
it
were
more
common
prosit
mk
d
a
nice
simple
beer
to
relax
and
enjoy
nicely
priced
ill
try
this
again
overall
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
have
to
explore
a
little
more
in
this
beer
style
it
was
refreshing
i
hate
macro
beer
commercial
lingo
but
it
really
is
refreshing
pours
a
five
finger
creamy
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
slightly
hoppy
mostly
a
yeasty
hoppy
flavor
but
strangely
there
is
also
some
sweet
caramel
3
45
for
a
500
ml
bottle
from
colonial

acton
ma
ps
i
grilled
up
some
big
fat
italian
sausages
and
some
hungarian
anaheim
and
thai
red
peppers
with
white
onions
and
tossed
it
all
in
between
a
couple
split
brotchen
and
used
this
kb
to
wash
it
down
man
that
was
tasty
this
is
my
first
keller
poured
out
of
the
swingtop
bottle
a
deep
cloudy
golden
brown
w
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
exploded
out
of
my
glass
lasted
a
few
minutes
then
laced
its
way
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
quite
faint
w
hints
of
malts
and
grassy
hops
and
a
touch
of
some
type
of
fruit
crispdry
and
tart
a
good
hop
flavor
a
citrusy
finish
a
light
body
w
good
balance
of
co2body
kinda
tingles
on
your
tounge
for
a
moment
definitly
a
good
drinking
beer
ill
be
sure
to
try
more
of
this
style
golden
brown
lightly
hazy
topped
with
a
fat
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
layers
of
sheeting
lace
down
my
half
liter
willibecker
tumbler
the
head
thins
a
bit
but
sticks
around
for
the
duration
spicy
floral
hop
aroma
very
clean
minerally
a
bit
of
lemongrass
and
apple
skin
pils
malt
smells
quite
fresh
toasty
pils
malt
in
the
front
of
the
sip
a
bit
of
moderately
kilned
grain
in
there
very
clean
with
a
soup
cracker
breadiness
a
very
hard
water
quality
nearly
flinty
with
persistent
mineral
character
kinda
like
real
mountain
spring
water
and
it
gives
the
beer
a
very
precise
straighttothepoint
character
exactly
what
youd
expect
of
the
finest
german
beer
a
touch
of
honey
nuttiness
and
faint
grassy
esters
restrained
malty
sweetness
into
the
finish
met
with
an
assertive
german
hop
bitterness
floral
and
brisk
somewhat
metallic
in
that
particular
noble
hop
way
cutting
off
clean
with
very
little
aftertaste
sturdy
bustling
carbonation
with
a
fairly
light
body
bordering
on
medium
somehow
this
beer
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
severe
stern
german
schoolteachers
with
a
very
tight
bun
and
hornrimmed
eyeglasses
somehow
uncompromising
and
unwilling
to
suffer
a
weak
palate
this
is
quality
stuff
for
the
more
serious
german
beer
fan
a
bit
more
complex
than
usual
and
cleaner
than
most
it
just
screams
germany
and
gives
you
a
disapproving
glare
ill
have
to
get
this
again
a
knockout
pours
a
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
an
average
egg
shell
white
head
the
smell
is
of
faint
malt
not
much
else
the
brew
has
a
milk
chocolate
taste
no
noticable
hop
flavors
it
has
a
good
flavor
though
it
is
faint
not
very
complex
the
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
and
well
balanced
this
brew
doesnt
blow
me
away
with
flavor
but
the
flavor
that
it
does
have
is
pleasant
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
to
session
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
full
of
flavor
and
without
flaws
the
taste
is
that
of
a
ale
and
lager
mixed
together
there
is
a
good
malty
sweetness
but
finishes
a
little
bitter
in
the
end
mouthfeel
was
also
smooth
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
the
flavor
is
malty
but
gently
so
the
breadyness
smoothes
things
out
and
creates
a
gratifying
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
malty
smooth
full
yet
light
and
drinkable
i
dont
see
many
keller
beers
so
i
have
an
impulse
to
grab
one
on
sight
and
i
am
very
glad
this
bottle
caught
my
eye
in
the
aftertaste
after
the
notes
of
malt
and
caramel
some
herbal
hop
very
good
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
and
not
an
every
day
thing
but
would
not
mind
having
more
in
the
future
thanks
to
todd
the
beer
guy
at
mckean
and
charles
in
waldoboro
for
pointing
this
beer
in
my
direction
its
excellent
a
500ml
swing
top
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
me
like
a
caramel
candied
apple
very
pleasant
malt
taste
with
the
fruity
caramel
presence
then
a
little
tang
at
the
end
a
really
enjoyable
and
fun
to
drink
beer
wow
this
was
great
it
went
down
super
easy
and
was
just
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
happy
it
makes
me
wonder
why
this
genre
is
not
more
popular
or
common
incredibly
refreshing
i
could
see
this
being
a
fantastic
summer
lager
where
you
want
something
with
something
and
not
just
the
same
old
same
old
i
can
also
see
it
being
a
great
appetizer
beer
as
well
as
pairing
nicely
with
shellfish
or
pepperchile
crusted
anything
or
with
an
amuse
or
even
something
like
gingerbread
i
recommend
this
highly
to
all
those
looking
for
more
in
a
summer
lager
price
is
a
little
prohibitive
though
at
4
a
bottle
in
my
area
im
guessing
the
abv
may
be
around
6
due
to
the
moderate
buzz
it
provides
very
low
carbonation
gives
a
velvety
impression
as
the
malt
seeps
into
every
corner
of
your
mouth
i
could
drink
this
beer
forever
decent
beer
easy
enough
to
drink
could
easily
drink
another
but
wouldnt
make
a
big
effort
to
get
one
warm
and
inviting
this
is
going
well
with
a
chili
cheese
dip
and
chips
will
need
to
have
more
of
these
only
3
75
for
a
swing
top
pint
bottle
pours
quite
dark
for
the
style
almost
like
apple
cider
made
with
molasses
cloudy
and
little
head
to
speak
of
nice
roasty
zesty
aroma
that
showcases
spices
and
munich
malts
on
the
palate
theres
more
sweetness
than
i
expected
with
some
caramel
notes
coming
through
that
drown
out
a
bit
of
the
bready
spiciness
suggested
by
the
nose
and
style
guidelines
very
smooth
in
mouthfeel
minimal
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
pretty
big
example
of
the
style
lots
of
thick
malt
flavors
it
doesnt
have
enough
of
a
hop
bite
for
my
taste
though
and
that
makes
it
lack
a
bit
of
nuance
very
good
but
not
the
best
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
complexity
for
a
lighterbodied
beer
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
does
not
become
cloying
recommended
for
a
beer
with
a
nice
taste
and
a
lighter
body
really
surprised
with
this
one
poured
a
medium
golden
honey
orange
colour
with
a
white
foamy
head
that
subsided
in
a
few
seconds
left
pretty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
earthy
and
sweet
almost
smelled
like
flowers
or
plant
matter
but
not
in
a
hoppy
way
a
bit
odd
very
nice
though
taste
is
malty
sweet
up
front
some
bitterness
in
the
middle
with
an
earthy
musty
undertone
then
there
is
a
very
faintly
noticeable
taste
of
clover
honey
clover
honey
in
particular
not
simply
honey
its
a
mild
sweet
plant
matter
taste
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
indeed
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
well
rounded
carbonation
was
less
than
average
this
was
a
great
beer
and
a
lovely
representation
of
the
style
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
as
flavorful
as
some
of
the
other
kellerbiers
ive
had
id
give
it
another
try
if
i
saw
it
again
somewhere
though
love
the
fliptop
bottle
saved
for
my
collection
kellers
are
new
to
me
and
i
now
wonder
why
i
hadnt
tried
the
style
before
i
love
the
mönchshof
schwarzbier
so
i
thought
id
try
this
one
wow
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
in
the
glass
mostly
malt
in
the
nose
then
the
taste
phenomenally
rich
malt
with
a
very
nice
and
very
subtle
slightly
fruity
hops
flavor
that
really
rounds
out
the
flavor
im
glad
the
bottle
was
larger
than
12
ounces
i
was
very
happy
to
top
off
my
glass
about
halfway
through
unfortunately
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
trying
pours
a
cloudy
golden
russet
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
yeasty
aroma
with
some
bready
malt
in
the
background
along
with
some
spicy
hops
taste
is
clean
and
fresh
with
a
little
breadiness
reminiscent
of
fresh
oyster
crackers
good
summer
beer
this
is
an
amazing
lager
although
the
look
of
it
is
a
little
deceiving
the
flavor
is
great
poured
in
the
glass
its
a
nice
amber
color
without
much
head
the
aroma
picks
up
with
fresh
clean
malt
notes
the
taste
really
hits
hard
great
malt
profile
tending
to
a
little
toastiness
that
fills
the
mouth
with
pleasure
the
hops
are
well
balanced
with
the
malt
and
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
completes
the
overall
flavor
these
flavors
linger
and
are
followed
but
a
hop
tang
that
highlights
the
thirst
quenching
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
would
consider
this
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
a
really
great
beer
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
also
has
that
crisp
and
sharp
lager
bite
on
the
finish
it
washes
cleanly
away
with
only
enough
after
taste
to
draw
me
back
in
pretty
good
i
had
been
searching
for
something
a
bit
different
and
i
found
it
in
this
i
dont
know
if
ill
buy
it
again
but
ill
definitely
be
more
receptive
to
the
style
if
i
see
new
examples
monchshof
kellerbrau
pours
a
nice
copper
color
from
a
brown
16
9
ounce
swingtop
bottle
i
like
the
aroma
malt
caramel
and
floral
hops
are
all
present
caramel
and
toffe
notes
predominate
and
the
hops
give
a
nice
backbone
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
though
interesting
style
quite
sessionable
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
i
dig
it
d
quite
good
but
fairly
malty
heavy
and
sweet
easily
approached
but
might
be
a
little
much
for
a
session
halfliter
brown
swingtop
bottle
unfiltered
with
no
freshness
date
i
poured
this
one
like
a
hefe
into
a
big
german
mug
it
was
at
first
a
clear
chestnut
but
after
the
sediment
turned
a
murky
mahogany
it
has
very
active
carbonation
and
it
develops
a
1
inch
khaki
head
with
smaller
bubbles
on
top
and
bigger
ones
on
the
bottom
but
becomes
a
very
small
thin
layer
there
are
lots
of
toasty
grains
in
the
aroma
which
is
very
clean
like
a
macro
lager
and
there
are
faint
notes
of
spicyfloral
hops
the
flavor
is
too
clean
and
watery
though
it
does
have
notes
of
the
same
grains
and
hops
but
with
additional
traces
of
wet
paper
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
but
it
leaves
a
short
finish
and
although
it
is
quite
drinkable
it
gets
a
little
boring
by
the
end
id
like
to
try
other
examples
of
the
style
though
the
beer
poured
from
a
half
liter
bottle
a
dark
amber
color
mildly
hazy
topped
a
thin
tan
head
the
beer
has
a
mild
bread
dough
aroma
i
associate
with
many
belgian
beers
along
with
a
nice
malty
finish
of
dark
caramel
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
more
of
the
dark
caramel
mid
drink
there
is
a
fruitiness
maybe
pear
that
comes
across
the
finish
i
toffee
and
a
light
hop
citrus
character
really
interesting
beer
one
of
the
most
unique
lagers
ive
ever
had
good
mouth
feel
smooth
without
a
lingering
sweetness
very
drinkable
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
lots
of
cane
syrup
notes
brownyellow
in
color
with
a
large
white
head
flavor
is
bready
and
grainy
with
sweet
caramel
malts
dominsting
the
fore
and
middle
aftertaste
leaves
you
filling
like
you
just
ate
a
doughnut
or
pastry
very
filling
beer
because
of
that
pastry
flavor
gotta
love
the
pop
top
didnt
realize
this
was
a
kulmbacher
beer
til
i
tried
searching
for
it
anyway
onto
the
review
damn
this
sure
is
clear
for
an
unfiltered
german
lager
dont
know
if
thats
a
good
thing
or
bad
thing
i
kind
of
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
keller
bier
was
that
it
was
sort
of
a
hazy
and
hearty
lager
pumpkin
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
moving
on
smells
nice
and
sweet
full
of
pale
raw
malts
plenty
of
grainy
notes
as
well
in
the
taste
theres
a
more
pronounced
honey
characteristic
that
i
find
in
many
of
these
german
lagers
so
nice
also
a
mischevious
spicy
hop
boquet
is
hiding
in
there
really
tasty
perhaps
a
little
fizzy
in
the
mouthfeel
but
that
adds
to
the
crispness
almost
suggesting
a
pilsnerish
vibe
almost
any
german
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
to
me
especially
these
lagers
and
especially
after
a
long
friday
night
behind
the
bar
yum
drinkable
hell
yes
creamy
and
tasty
low
alcohol
percentage
and
boatloads
of
appeal
my
only
caution
is
to
buy
this
now
check
my
review
date
as
its
been
in
the
us
for
a
month
already
and
isnt
getting
any
better
walk
no
run
to
your
local
good
beer
store
and
indulge
in
a
zuper
keller
an
exercise
in
balance
but
i
prefer
some
of
the
rawer
rougher
examples
of
this
style
i
had
in
bamberg
this
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
vegetal
greeny
hop
undertone
of
some
others
ive
had
still
excellent
golden
brown
lightly
hazy
topped
with
a
fat
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
layers
of
sheeting

half
liter

the
head
thins
a
bit

sticks
around
for
the
duration
spicy
floral

aroma
very
clean
minerally
a
bit
of
lemongrass
and
apple
skin
pils
malt
smells
quite
fresh
toasty
pils
malt
in
the
front
of
the
sip
a
bit
of
moderately
kilned
grain
in
there
very
clean
with
a
soup
cracker
breadiness
a
very
hard
water
quality
nearly
flinty
with
persistent
mineral
character
kinda
like
real
mountain
spring
water
and
it
gives
the
beer
a
very
precise
straighttothepoint
character
exactly
what
youd
expect
of
the
finest
german
beer
a
touch
of
honey
nuttiness
and
faint
grassy
esters
restrained
malty
sweetness
into
the
finish
met
with
an
assertive
german
hop
bitterness
floral
and
brisk
somewhat
metallic
in
that
particular
noble
hop
way
cutting
off
clean
with
very
little
aftertaste
sturdy
bustling
carbonation
with
a
fairly
light
body
bordering
on
medium
somehow
this
beer
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
severe
stern
german
schoolteachers
with
a
very
tight
bun
and
hornrimmed
eyeglasses
somehow
uncompromising
and
unwilling
to
suffer
a
weak
palate
this
is
quality
stuff
for
the
more
serious
german
beer
fan
a
bit
more
complex
than
usual
and
cleaner
than
most
it
just
screams
germany
and
gives
you
a
disapproving
glare
ill
have
to
get
this
again

not

good
as
the
mahrs
i
had
last
night
order
it
at
the

if
you
dont

in

about

after
the
pour
some
sheets

when
sipped
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
sweet

for
the
most
part
including
caramel

pretty
much
is
said
for
the
taste
which
also
includes
a

which
is
probably
orange
goes
down
easy
with
no

smooth

overall
a
good
brew
oi
like
this
beer
even
though
i
did
not
taste
the
hops
as
much
as
the
style
suggests
i
should
the
bottle
was
pretty
old
so
i
can
see
freshness
being
an
issue
nevertheless
the
beer
has
nice
flavors
drinks
easily
and
doesnt
beat
your
palate
down
with
overwhelming
booziness
sweetness
coffee
bourbon

or
whatever
id
buy
more
one
of
the
best
kellerbiers
that
ive
had
awesome
overall
this
is
my
first
kellerbier
other
than
sierra
nevadas
kellerweis
i
wasnt
thrilled
with
the
beer
when
i
first
sampled
it
but
it
is
definitely
growing
on
me
as
i
progress
through
the
tasting
this
would
make
a
great
hot
weather
beer
and
if
you
like
hefes
but
are
looking
for
something
a
little
different
this
might
be
up
your
alley
4
paws
overall
this
is
a
lovely
beer
and
one
that
certainly
enforces
the
great
beer
reputation
of
germany
ive
had
plenty
of
kellerbier
in
the
states
and
nothing
has
gotten
me
as
excited
about
the
style
as
this
one
if
i
had
a
cave
in
my
backyard
you
know
damn
well
what
id
be
doing
only
difference
is
mine
wouldnt
taste
this
good
this
is
impressive
stuff
from
mahrsbrau
overall
this
is
my
first
kellerbier
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
unique
style
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
pours
a
golden
seethru
body
that
has
good
fizzy
head
that
dies
quick
with
little
lace
patches
the
aroma
is
typical
of
pils
malt
and
grain
with
some
yeast
notes
mixed
in
beer
is
smooth
light
crisp
and
has
a
great
balance
of
hops
grainybready
malts
mild
fruit
sweetness
like
pear
or
tropical
fruit
and
also
a
bit
of
spice
pretty
good
and
complex
beer
that
is
easily
drunk
and
quite
deceptive
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
straightup
lagers
ive
ever
had
very
clean
great
flavors
and

little
hop
bite
freshness
may
be
imperative
for
this
kind
of
goodness
overall
its
fine
its
decent
its
a
reasonably
well
crafted
beer
but
a

can
be
truly
great

love

love
this
beer
easily
my
favorite
keller
ive
had
to
date
o
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
style
and
this
beer
for
unknown
reasons
just
kinda
knew
it
would
be
good
and
i
was
not
disappointed
an
enjoyable
and
special
drinking
experience
hope
to
one
day
try
this
style
in
germany
rjt
its
a
full
flavored
beer
but
quite
smooth
and
light
to
medium
bodied
super
drinkable
and
something
i
could
drink
over
and
over
again
pours
a
light
amber
gold
color
glowy
its
quite
hazy
from
all
that
yeast
i
assume
yellowish
white
head
puffs
up
nicely
at
first
some
lacing
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
all
sweet
fresh
grain
it
smells
like
high
quality
malt
not
an
off
note
to
be
found
just
light
doughy
flavors
with
a
floral
hop
background
the
taste
is
similar
theres
a
wonderful
bready
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
more
hops
than
come
across
in
the
aroma
its
a
bit
drier
than
expected
its
got
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malt
flavor
but
it
pretty
much
dries
out
by
the
finish
and
the
beer
finishes
clean
and
pretty
crisp
nice
floral
grassy
hop
flavor
throughout
the
taste
some
light
fruitiness
apples
apricots
pears
but
it
really
tastes
more
like
straight
clean
grain
lots
of
flavor
for
the
abv
light
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
still
fills
out
the
palate
carbonation
seems
a
bit
low
which
probably
helps
with
that
creamy
yet
light
feel
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
grabbed
this
bottle
before
it
even
hit
the
shelf
came
off
the
truck
at
a
local
store
two
days
ago
so
its
pretty
much
as
fresh
as
im
going
to
find
it
around
here
and
it
definitely
shows
id
love
for
more
american
breweries
to
produce
beers
like
this
its
right
and
light
and
theres
not
even
a
hint
of
an
off
note
very
tasty
stuff
scrumptious
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
malt
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
an
excellent
kellerbier
very
tasty
and
high
drinkable
as
well
definitely
give
this
a
shot
nice
brew
great
balance
and
drinkability
really
nice
it
has
that
beautiful
malt
profile
you
associate
with
darker
german
beers
and
yet
that
great
drinkability
is
still
there
id
been
eyeing
this
one
for
a
while
as
i
love
other
mahrs
beers
if
you
like
marzens
helles
and
dunkels
definitely
give
this
a
shot
d
tasty
stuff
malt
dominant
as
most
franconian
lagers
but
the
hint
of
green
apple
and
drier
finish
provided
a
bit
of
balance
went
well
with
my
zwiebelrostbraten
which
i
thoroughly
recommend
trying
if
at
the
pub
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
out
it
has
some
good
characteristics
and
although
there
are
a
few
flaws
it
makes
a
good
case
for
the
character
of
this
style
worth
trying
out
and
puts
other
lagerstyles
to
shame
in
terms
of
flavour
and
complexity
good
balance
allround
o
a
smooth
and
creamy
tasting
keller
unfiltered
and
delicious
o
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
i
thought
this
was
a
wonderfully
drinkable
lager
that
quenched
my
thirst
really
well
which
is
about
all
you
can
ask
for
from
a
lager
drinks
like
a
thick
ale
not
a
lager
overall
45
mahrs
ungespundethefetrüb
is
a
highly
refreshing
beer
whose
flavor
profile
exhibits
characteristics
of
other
wellknown
far
less
obscure
german
beers
so
i
think
anyone
who
enjoys
german
beer
would
enjoy
it
an
easydrinking
lager
that
definitely
brings
the
flavor
good
stuff
glad
i
tried
it
i
really
like
this
an
unusual
style
and
well
done
by
a
traditional
german
brewery
something
i
enjoy
and
would
recommend
overall
this
was
a
tasty
and
interesting
beer
my
first
from
mahrs
id
recommend
it
o
this
beer
is
remarkably
complex
considering
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
that
fullbodied
on
tap
at
winos
in
bowling
green
offered
as
an
alternative
and
in
protest
of
greendyed
st
pattys
beers
relatively
low
level
of
carbonation
but
still
lively
enough
very
clean
flavor
with
a
light
wheat
note
going
just
a
little
watery
toward
the
finish
overall
quite
refreshing
kudos
to
blake
for
making
arrangements
to
have
the
beer
served
in
the
brewerys
stoneware
mug
chilled
to
the
same
temperature
as
the
beer
very
refreshing
beer
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
definitely
one
id
get
again
half
litre
bottle
poured
a
large
head
amber
colour
clear
aroma
started
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
but
got
more
hoppy
corky
taste
was
more
bitter
than
others
kellerzwickels
had
a
roasted
malty
finish
didnt
think
it
was
overly
smooth
nice
well
made
but
better
on
tap
dr
not
a
good
beer
to
drink
once
let
alone
repeatedly
feels
very
oxidized
and
downright
wrong
the
dirty
aftertaste
makes
me
cough
a
bit
at
times
its
affordable
but
avoidable
i
wasnt
expecting
such
aromas
from
this
lighter
colored
beer
some
good
spicy
phenols
and
lots
of
fruit
after
the
first
drink
it
was
clearly
about
the
malt
though
it
almost
tasted
like
a
malty
cider
with
everything
that
was
going
on
i
was
suprised
by
the
complexity
but
very
pleased
with
its
drinkability
m
d
average
mouthfeel
but
the
offflavor
completely
devastated
any
drinkability
d
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
why
franconia
is
the
place
for
beer
this
tastes
proper
slightly
sweet
and
wortlike
with
grain
and
toasted
malts
lasting
yeasty
tastes
german
style
awesome
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
so
quenching
for
the
higher
alcohol
content
served
in
a
signature
ceramic
mug
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
oranged
copper
with
a
white
head
of
indeterminable
size
being
in
the
mug
as
it
was
which
retained
for
a
while
then
sank
to
just
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
simple
no
nonsense
aroma
of
grains
more
grains
and
light
herbal
hops
light
tasting
grains
pils
malts
light
caramel
grassy
with
an
herbal
almost
tealike
hoppiness
slightly
bitter
lighmedium
body
and
very
drinkable
even
if
not
overly
distinctive
o
loved
it
not
the
german
i
wanted
to
try
that
night
but
th
eonly
one
being
tapped
i
went
for
it
completely
shocked
at
how
much
i
liked
it
as
jlindros
said
something
i
expect
to
be
drinking
in
munich
o
ive
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
on
tap
and
adore
it
one
of
my
favorite
allnight
drinkers
waiting
to
stumble
on
a
bottle
to
review
it
as
i
dont
like
to
review
at
bars
this
sets
the
mark
for
the
style
overall
great
what
i
would
expect
to
drink
if
i
went
to
munich
nice
toasty
straw
malts
grassy
noble
hops
juicy
and
drinkable
overall
drinkability
the
best
in
the
style
ive
had
but
this
is
only
my
second
or
third
so
thats
optimism
at
best
and
sarcasm
at
worst
disappointing
beer
kellerbiers
can
be
good
the
wolnzacher
hell
is
excellent
for
instance
this
is
just
bland
it
is
tasty
i
picked
up
the
bottle
at
mahrs
in
bamberg
myself
during
my
last
trip
to
germany
good
pick
and
ill
gladly
try
other
kellerbiers
the
taste
is
flavored
by
the
malt
which
is
the
star
of
this
zwickel
kind
of
between
a
helles
and
marzen
this
is
a
beer
style
i
have
only
had
a
handful
of
times
yet
find
it
enjoyable
everytime
it
has
a
lot
of
yeast
and
malt
synergy
with
dry
and
creamy
qualities
and
the
smoothness
is
delicious
in
a
refreshing
flavorful
way
i
recommend
this
to
those
who
enjoy
lagers
because
it
is
not
strong
hoppy
or
flashy
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
kolsch
with
how
light
it
is
with
apples
this
is
a
good
lager
it
has
plenty
of
flavor
a
well
done
brew
with
a
cloudy
golden
color
and
a
slight
off
white
head
mild
caramel
with
a
nice
head
of
three
fingers
nose
is
delicate
sweet
of
honey
and
caramel
and
a
pilsner
like
bitter
wood
odor
palate
is
a
nice
balance
of
that
some
floral
pollen
notes
with
a
hint
of
funk
straw
flax
seed
resin
the
malt
is
honey
to
stale
grape
and
mild
ripe
apple
great
balance
good
for
any
time
of
year
best
as
session
in
autumn
pouring
light
amber
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
poor
retention
the
head
recedes
to
a
ring
rather
rapidly
the
nose
is
surprisingly
timid
with
a
blend
of
caramel
a
little
sulfur
and
some
fruity
yeast
along
with
the
caramel
theres
a
slight
breadlike
character
as
well
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
breadlike
sweetness
a
surprising
fruit
character
one
that
im
not
used
to
encountering
in
a
kellerbier
the
hops
are
fairly
muted
i
cant
really
say
i
pick
much
up
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
theres
some
caramel
some
bread
present
the
sweetness
does
linger
slightly
into
the
finish
providing
a
touch
of
yeasty
character
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
solid
not
the
best
pour
ive
had
of
this
beer
but
its
still
solid
stuff
sweet
and
spicy
reminiscent
of
apples
soft
earthy
yeast
taste
medium
body
with
a
quite
slick
feel
on
the
tongue
drinlability
is
good
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
pale
amber
in
the
stein
its
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
body
is
cloudy
and
turbid
signature
of
the
style
the
suspended
yeast
brings
out
a
light
fruity
scent
reminiscent
of
stonefruit
theres
a
pale
malt
backbone
a
touch
of
toast
and
herbal
hops
its
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
crisp
crackery
malt
at
the
forefront
with
spicy
herbal
hops
and
mild
fruity
yeast
flavors
lending
subtle
complexity
the
finish
is
dry
herbal
mildly
peppery
and
bitter
excellent
stuff
a
ubercarbonated
beer
took
the
barternder
a
good
ten
minutes
of
pouring
to
get
me
a
full
glass
it
is
a
dark
gold
with
light
orange
highlights
super
dark
for
a
lager
huge
white
head
fix
fingers
of
head
with
an
awesome
swirl
on
top
sticking
up
sevearl
inches
over
the
glass
reminds
you
of
a
ice
cream
cone
swirl
so
gorgeou
head
falls
in
chunks
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
caramel
on
the
nose
with
corn
light
finish
i
was
expecting
to
get
skunk
where
is
it
surprsingly
it
isnt
a
super
crisp
drinker
but
it
is
refrehsing
ive
heard
about
the
bamberg
lagers
and
this
was
good
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
little
bit
of
cloudy
haze
has
a
great
unique
aroma
its
very
floral
yet
a
bit
on
the
funky
sour
side
kind
of
earthybready
flavor
follows
big
floral
sweetness
which
is
followed
by
a
sour
bread
taste
very
pleasant
and
unique
my
first
go
at
this
style
but
will
be
looking
for
more
examples
slainte
the
mix
of
sour
with
earthy
hops
didnt
sit
well
with
me
it
was
a
bit
stiff
to
drink
from
a
halfliter
german
bottle
bottled
on
4
7
60
whatever
that
means
the
website
refers
to
this
as
a
farmers
beer
that
is
brewed
with
dual
line
summer
brew
barley
and
the
finest
aroma
and
amaroid
hops
it
has
a
highlycarbonated
brassy
hue
with
lots
of
floaties
and
a
finger
of
loose
tan
head
smooth
and
buttery
in
the
nose
but
not
in
a
diacetyl
way
punctuated
with
grass
and
hay
nice
and
malty
on
the
palate
with
notes
of
grain
grass
and
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
the
hops
are
there
as
well
contributing
a
firm
yet
pleasing
bitterness
on
top
of
its
light
and
tingly
dry
body
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
quite
easy
to
drink
giving
the
impression
of
a
pilsner
in
the
rough
wellworth
a
try
its
the
wood
that
makes
it
good
ive
had
this
beer
in
bottle
form
here
in
the
states
and
when
not
too
old
its
solid
but
at
the
pub
in
bamberg
from
the
wood
only
after
300
pm
its
one
of
the
best
drinks
in
the
world
i
challenge
all
the
alehop
heads
to
have
this
from
the
wooden
cask
gravity
poured
and
very
fresh
and
to
not
say
that
lager
beer
cant
be
exquisite
drinkability
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
but
i
recommend
this
to
someone
who
enjoys
a
light
open
of
wheat
and
bittering
hops
toward
the
middle
end
with
a
pilsner
like
aftertaste
medium
to
fulllish
in
body
with
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
that
draws
very
little
attention
to
itself
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
no
dates
to
be
found
and
carbonation
was
solid
so
i
think
i
just
dont
like
this
beer
my
advice
stay
away
the
taste
is
quite
nice
there
is
a
nice
fairly
uncarbonated
tang
and
citrusy
acerbicness
there
are
some
overly
ripe
apple
flavors
maybe
some
pear
there
is
some
definite
yeastiness
to
the
beer
maybe
a
touch
of
clove
as
well
this
is
an
interesting
complex
beer
that
gives
you
something
different
with
each
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
slight
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
this
is
a
refreshing
tangy
fairly
uncarbonated
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
for
its
novelty
on
gravity
at
the
avenue
pours
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
billowing
rocky
white
head
that
lasts
smells
of
full
grainy
pilsner
malt
backed
up
by
strong
grassy
aromatic
hops
slightly
sweet
grainy
taste
with
some
wet
straw
character
the
light
hop
bitterness
is
more
than
ample
to
dry
this
one
out
completely
mediumfull
body
with
lower
carbonation
this
is
a
favorite
of
mindalways
good
but
best
when
its
super
fresh
particularly
on
cask
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
refreshing
cloudy
gold
body
with
visible
yeast
chunks
mmmm
yeast
chunks
fruity
floral
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
wonderful
fruity
yeasty
flavor
and
a
nice
malty
sweetness
apricot
and
peach
notes
restrained
hop
flavor
but
a
nice
fruity
tart
finish
sharp
carbonation
my
kind
of
lager
refreshing
but
never
boring
the
taste
is
simialr
but
drier
than
anticipated
it
has
bread
grain
lemon
apple
a
lot
of
toasted
grain
as
well
as
dough
its
fairly
dry
and
light
very
light
sweetness
with
balancing
light
bitterness
as
well
as
a
light
lemonyappley
tartness
its
good
light
crisp
and
tasty
but
slightly
too
dry
and
thin
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
among
several
kellerbeers
i
brought
back
from
germany
this
was
my
favorite
if
only
i
could
have
more
bottles
of
this
one
from
a
halfliter
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
a
hazy
orange
amber
golden
color
with
a
generous
white
head
and
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
and
taste
is
of
grain
and
hay
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
drinkability
is
extremely
high
on
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
it
mmmm
kellerbier
i
was
quite
happy
to
see
this
awaiting
me
i
ordered
one
right
up
eagerly
pouring
the
hazyopaque
gold
in
all
its
unfiltered
goodness
made
me
even
happier
as
a
fine
white
2
finger
fluffy
head
sat
atop
a
lovely
beer
leaving
nice
bright
lace
throughout
a
honey
aroma
with
wheaty
grass
reminded
me
of
some
farmhouse
wheat
ales
and
the
like
the
flavor
likewise
maintained
the
aromatic
flavors
but
added
some
herbal
grains
and
nice
wheaty
yeast
but
the
malt
definitely
dominated
with
its
mediumbody
crisp
honey
qualities
very
drinkable
i
love
this
style
and
flavor
prosit
the
drinkability
is
good
its
nothing
thats
going
to
bowl
you
over
with
flavor
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
an
old
style
and
it
really
does
seem
to
have
an
old
school
feel
to
it
well
worth
a
try
d
overall
this
beer
is
a
decent
brew
that
is
worth
a
shot
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
golden
hazy
appearance
with
pale
malt
on
the
nose
and
very
little
finish
to
the
taste
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
an
exemplary
example
of
its
style
while
not
necessarily
the
most
exciting
thing
ive
ever
drunk
unfiltered
beer
served
on
draft
in
their
pub
light
amber
color
persistent
white
head
some
aroma
of
hops
also
a
woodsy
maltiness
that
suggests
great
things
to
come
the
taste
is
fantastic
rich
and
malty
its
light
at
first
sip
but
continues
to
blossom
in
your
mouth
there
is
a
light
hop
presence
but
it
sits
in
the
backseat
behind
the
rich
grain
and
bread
flavors
finish
is
a
light
lingering
bitterness
with
the
full
malty
taste
hanging
around
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
other
local
beers
since
it
seems
so
filling
and
has
such
a
full
taste
but
its
a
great
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
i
allow
for
the
possibility
that
this
is
simply
a
bad
bottle
bought
it
out
of
curiosity
if
i
buy
again
it
will
not
be
from
the
same
place
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
deep
golden
almost
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
that
settles
slowly
carbonation
is
vigorous
yet
very
fine
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
wasnt
very
prominent
some
bread
and
malty
character
with
a
dry
hop
edge
the
flavors
were
much
more
than
the
smell
it
starts
malty
with
bread
and
a
slight
sweetness
and
is
followed
with
a
light
lemony
hop
finish
that
cleanses
the
palate
for
the
next
sip
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
a
perfect
starter
for
an
evening
its
very
clean
and
each
sip
tastes
just
as
good
as
the
one
before
incredibly
approachable
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
bottom
line
what
a
wonderful
brew
i
just
finished
it
sure
makes
me
want
to
try
some
more
of
the
style
as
this
one
has
everything
going
for
it
including
drinkability
thanks
again

was
pissed
off
that
it

tapped
out
so
soon
on

one
hand
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
the

it
is
quite

bag
aftertaste
the
rough
palate
smooths
out
a
little
as
the
beer
warms
but
it
is
still
a
far
cry
from
what
is
expected
after
inhaling
its
sweet
aroma
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
spot
on
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
good
beer
if
it
tasted
anything
like
it
smelled
described
by
marrikkas
bierstube
as
an
unfiltered
lager
the
beer
pours
a
more
hazy
than
expected
golden

color
with
lowlying

formation

good
staying

with

across

the
stage
for
overripened
apples

oranges

complexity
usually
seen
in
those
aged

beers
the
low

gives
a
sense
of

with
a
soft
heavy
texture
lightly
oily
and
flat
late
finishes
with
lingering
malt
and
fruit
flavor
showing
hints
of
corn

if
the
aftertaste
quite
bohemian
and
traditional
albeit
on
the
diry
side
this
was
a
buyonce
beer
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
but
unlikely
to
try
again
moan
and
dove
finally
had
mahrs
bottled
again
so
i
sampled
this
along
with
other
mahrs
styles
this
one
settled
with
a
murky
amber
appearance
with
a
stable
quarterinch
head
creamy
lacing
also
the
aromas
were
good
collage
of
spicy
and
fruity
flavors
with
even
a
slight
caramel
tone
i
could
sense
the
taste
was
mostly
bitter
but
had
a
slightly
smoked
and
spicy
aftertaste
to
it
medium
body
with
subtle
crispness
helped
it
from
not
being
overpowering
overall
pretty
good
very
easy
drinker
especially
with
the
crispness
it
has
i
had
to
slow
down
so
i
could
finish
the
review
before
the
beer
medium
bodied
and
drinkable
the
smoke
gave
it
a
nice
touch
that
made
it
stand
out
from
the
other
german
beers
i
tried
that
night
very
drinkable
as
is
this
style
how
i
missed
this
one
when
i
was
in
germany
is
beyond
me
a
very
good
keller
this
beer
had
a
dry
bready
flavor
and
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
was
very
low
garrett
mentioned
that
it
was
open
air
fermented
notes
this
is
worth
hunting
down
both
sides
of
this
brew
are
well
put
together
my
first
of
this
style
of
beer
pours
a
balanced
cloudy
gold
with
minimal
head
the
nose
gives
off
a
deep
earthy
yeast
on
the
mouth
it
is
mildly
acidic
and
heavily
yeasty
it
stays
on
your
tongue
for
quite
some
time
as
it
warms
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
thick
from
the
body
of
the
brew
easily
drinkable
quite
drinkable
for
what
is
basically
a
historical
beer
type
and
one
that
is
quite
drinkable
as
far
as
archeology
beers
go
basically
a
thicker
more
bitter
lager
with
a
low
carbonation
level
the
mouth
is
balanced
and
sturdy
this
is
one
easy
drinking
beer
i
had
several
non
bas
with
me
and
they
all
loved
this
beer
so
it
can
also
function
as
an
excellent
cross
over
beer
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
of
course
in
a
traditional
clay
stein
krug
since
it
is
impossible
to
see
the
colour
all
i
can
describe
is
the
wonderful
large
off
white
rocky
foam
head
that
this
beer
has
it
smelt
fantastic
big
and
malty
with
a
slight
hop
pinch
to
it
this
beer
has
a
very
distinct
malt
character
to
it
very
robust
roasted
flavor
that
i
found
unique
in
all
the
beers
i
had
in
germany
very
full
mouth
feel
despite
all
its
perceived
quirks
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
and
enjoy
excellent
beer
cant
complain
about
anything
pours
a
hazy
honey
color
i
can
hardly
see
through
smells
like
wheat
bread
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
primary
flavor
i
taste
is
citrus
grapefruit
and
lemon
body
is
between
light
and
medium
refreshing
and
good
for
you
d
a
great
summer
quencher
the
dryness
adds
to
this
effect
id
like
to
sample
more
of
this
style
of
beer
but
they
are
extremely
difficult
to
find
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
drinkability
another
good
beer
for
the
summer
months
good
crossover
from
the
euro
lager
style
cheers
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
the
first
ive
had
of
this
style
md
light
but
almost
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
easy
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
i
imagine
this
will
be
a
beer
i
pick
up
on
occasion
throughout
the
summer
i
am
diggin
these
keller
biers
while
i
found
the
monchshof
to
be
just
slightly
better
this
one
has
more
of
a
citrus
quality
the
other
did
not
its
very
good
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
highly
and
suggest
it
with
seafood
et
all
a
great
alternative
to
standard
lagers
in
warmer
weather
and
to
lagers
in
general
give
this
and
other
keller
biers
a
try
this
summer
taste
leans
strongly
on
the
malt
which
is
pretty
heavy
and
upfront
body
is
full
there
is
very
little
bitterness
in
the
beer
which
is
strange
for
a
german
beer
usually
they
have
more
bitterness
andor
hoppiness
in
it
aftertaste
is
dry
and
sulfuric
malty
pours
a
slightly
hazed
brassy
gold
with
fat
bubbles
in
the
body
a
12
frothy
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
and
excellent
clinging
on
the
glass
leaves
raised
lacing
with
the
negative
space
making
interesting
figures
i
can
barely
pick
up
anything
from
the
nose
except
a
clean
lager
character
some
faint
pale
malt
and
even
fainter
hops
flavor
is
like
fresh
baked
bread
filled
with
nuts
and
dried
candied
fruits
delicious
finishes
dry
and
sufficiently
bitter
with
an
herbal
and
floral
hop
edge
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
an
appropriate
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
solid
body
on
this
one
carbonation
shows
up
and
is
at
once
smooth
on
one
end
and
mildly
prickly
on
the
other
helping
the
flavors
stand
out
this
one
goes
down
quick
which
is
a
shame
since
this
is
the
only
bottle
of
this
i
brought
back
to
texas
with
me
from
a
recent
trip
cloudy
lemon
yellow
with
orange
highlights
bubbly
ivory
white
head
shows
some
good
stick
great
aroma
yeast
is
evident
lemon
and
hay
some
cracker
tones
this
is
inviting
reminds
me
of
the
herk
keller
beer
aromawise
pretty
good
in
the
flavor
department
though
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
aroma
yeasty
and
quite
spicy
even
some
alcohol
is
noted
with
this
5
av
brew
a
little
lemongrass
mouthfeel
agrees
with
me
prickly
carbonation
could
act
as
a
palate
cleanser
between
bites
of
your
favorite
fish
dish
whether
thats
an
almond
crusted
salmon
fillet
or
say
a
thai
red
snapper
with
spicy
tamarind
sauce
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
last
kellerbier
i
had
from
herkimer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
always
do
when
in
bamberg
at
the
mahrs
keller
the
beer
is
always
fresh
and
served
in
a
stein
krug
as
it
should
be
the
beer
was
poured
from
the
barrel
on
the
counter
and
had
ample
head
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
color
in
the
stein
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
nice
amber
color
it
was
served
at
about
8
degrees
celsius
perfect
for
this
beer
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
my
first
kellerbier
experience
and
i
found
it
rather
indifferent
not
too
distant
from
any
lager
really
barring
the
citruisy
tang
and
cloudy
appearence
poured
an
almost
orange
colour
very
cloudy
a
musty
aroma
sharp
though
with
strong
citruis
mouthfeel
a
very
acidic
beer
which
affects
its
drinkability
slightly
but
still
refreshing
worth
a
try
just
to
experience
the
style
edit
had
this
on
tap
in
bamberg
and
it
was
arguably
the
best
kellerbier
ive
had
to
date
the
malty
flavors
run
wild
and
any
sourness
from
an
old
bottle
is
certainly
absent
huge
bready
character
tons
of
lageryeast
honeyclover
and
a
smooth
texture
id
probably
say
its
a
4
5
or
better
overall
but
i
dont
really
edit
old
reviews
just
for
the
sake
of
keeping
track
of
what
i
have
and
havent
had
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
a
little
pricey
but
quite
enjoyable
i
like
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
watery
and
thin
in
the
beginning
but
this
improves
with
the
yeast
addition
prickly
carbonation
without
much
follow
through
easy
but
not
that
interesting
overall
the
third
of
six
mahrs
brau
beers
that
each
cost
me
3
99
at
hollingshead
deli
in
orange
ca
the
earlier
two
appeared
to
offer
above
average
results
and
this
one
was
no
exception
let
down
by
the
flaccid
nose
and
dying
appearance
at
times
but
apart
from
that
it
is
a
clean
drinker
that
offered
more
than
most
finishes
dry
a
bit
tart
and
oxidized
a
great
introduction
to
a
new
style
very
drinkable
a
good
beer
alone
or
with
food
i
like
this
very
tossable
yet
with
plenty
of
taste
to
marvel
at
though
not
amazing
by
any
means
i
tend
not
to
pick
up
expensive
imported
bottled
beers
except
for
reasons
of
examination
the
old
trial
and
error
but
if
you
want
to
try
a
zwickel
you
wont
err
with
this
example
nice
easily
approachable
and
drinkable
beer
probably
a
good
step
up
from
german
macros
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
why
your
average
macro
drinker
wouldnt
like
this
beer
i
like
it
too
my
first
exposure
to
the
style
excluding
the
appearance
it
was
pretty
nice
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
gives
you
two
different
experiences
the
bulk
of
this
review
was
done
decanted
for
a
baseline
approach
it
is
incredibly
well
rounded
and
complex
but
really
comes
alive
at
the
end
when
you
pour
the
yeast
into
the
glass
i
assuredly
advise
you
to
do
so
the
palate
is
pleased
by
the
medium
to
mediumheavy
body
thats
coupled
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
that
comes
across
as
suitable
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
most
likely
from
the
hops
used
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
quite
good
lots
of
complexity
here
and
an
alcohol
content
and
taste
that
make
this
well
worth
having
multiple
times
even
in
one
session
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
cloudy
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
hoppy
nose
starts
with
a
mix
of
hops
and
sourness
with
hints
of

this

towards
the

but
maintains
itself
well
lacing
is

aroma
is
of
herbal
hops
and
a
honeylike
sweetness
taste
is
not
as
good
a
bit
of
a
soapyness
in
there
not
the
cleanest
but
still
solid
kind
of
a
yeasty
spice
bread

with
light
hops
and
herbs
and
sugars
a
decent
beer
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
and
yeast
body
is
not
the
smoothest
and
a
little
more
carbonation
would
have
been
nice
finishes
a
bit
citric
leaving
some
orange
notes
not
bad
i
am
going
to
try
this
fresh
and
see
how
much
of
a
difference
there
is
d
very
drinkable
lovely
orange
color
almost
no
head
despite
swirling
the
last
several
ounces
to
pick
up

out
a

color
with
several
inches
of
white
foam
after
several
minutes
the
head
fades
to
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
malty
with
herbs
and
grass
the
flavor
is
malty
with
a
zesty
lemon
flavor
grassy
hops
come
in
at
the
bitter

medium

full
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
little
high
this
is
a
very
flavorful
lager
ive
never
had
a
keller
beer
before
this
one
is
very
impressive
i
didnt
know
what
exactly
to
expect
out
of
this
bier
i
expected
more
smoke
from
a
bamburg
brewery
what
i
got
was
a
lot
of
woody
notes
in
flavor
and
aroma
it
was
a
decent
brew
but
i
would
of
been
happy
about
9
ounces
sooner
yeasty
mediumbodied
satisfyingthis
is
a
good
brew
in
terms
of
appearance
this
one
is
a

the
head
is
thick
stable
and
solidit
leaves
an
agreeable
lace
too
im
into
this
aroma
yeast
and
fruit
smells
of
moderate
intensity
but
very
enjoyable
i
smell
berries
peach
bread
and
a
musty
rustic
background
theres
bits
of
an
unmashed
pale
malt
aroma
as
well
not
bad
at
all
fairly
high
carbonation
the
brew
is
on
the
dry
side
and
has
a
nicely
balanced
finish
worth
a
try
or
two
overall
pretty
good
i
liked
it
but
not
sure
i
would
have
one
again
husband
didnt
like
it
as
much
and
ended
up
adding
a
dash
of
raspberry
syrup
to
his
which
i
tasted
and
must
say
was
quite
nice
instant
raspberry

was
very
good
if
i
could
get
it
at
a
store
closer
to
me
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
glad
i
got
to
stop

i
did

this

that
after
a
while
when
it
heats
up
gets
more

more
noticable
still
yes
this
is
a
quiet
good
example
of
a
refreshing
kellerbeer
with
good
mouthfeel
and
fine
carbonisation
making
it
enjoyable
and
dinkable
even
with
the
diacethyl

its
beers
like
this
that
remind
me
that
although
i
love
belgians
my
heart
belongs

this
brew
has
a
very
nofrills
feeling

of

with
buttery

this
is

this
could
be
a

are

its

thought
it

an

beer
towards
the
end
though
the
cheese
and
wet

smell
of
old

yeast
comes
in
well
the
bottle
was
seven
months
old
probably
past

and
they
did
seem
to
brew
it
to
compensate
for
that
possibility

that
slowly

the
aroma

it

a

it

i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
has
a
sweet
palate
they
must
be
using
munich
malts
to
add
the
extra
color
and
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
one
tastey
beer
it
has
excellent
aroma
and
flavor
a
good
drinker
this
is
like
a
british
ale
without
the
florid
expressive
fruitiness
of
an
ale
drinkability
im
left
feeling
like
this
beer
was
a
good
one
to
try
and
certainly
a
unique
experience
but
not
one
i
would
repeat
often
the
color
is
a
hazy
amberorange
with
a
averagesized
head
the
aroma
is
of
very
fullbodied
toasted
malts
the
taste
has
a
similar
character
as
the
aroma
fullflavored
toasted
malt
taste
is
joined
by
a
touch
of
raw

flavor
very
fresh
and
complex
tasting
the
sweet
finish
is
a
perfect
capper
for
this
beer
this
is
excellent
stuff
very
highly
drinkable
i
wish
more
brewers
would
take
this
style
on
poured
from
the
brown
bottle
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
head
that
reminded
me
of
a
fluffy
cloud
taste
reminded
me
of
a
german
version
of
fullers
esb
this
is
good
for
me
since
i
love
that
beer
slightly
hoppy
and
bitter
this
makes
for
a
tasty
beer
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
ill
be
buying
this
again
im
pretty
pleased
with
my
first
kellerbier
and
ill
definitely
look
to
try
more
of
them
now
that
i
know
what
makes
the
style
tick
this
is
a
good
one
to
lead
off
with
if
youre
contemplating
a
purchase
drinkability

boy
this
took
me
back
to
germany
it
is
a
solid
entry
in
this
category
and
goes
well
with
any
type
of
strong
german
sausage
mahrs
kellerbier
might
possibly
be
the
best
beer
out
of
their
lineup
it
pours
a
typical
kellerbier
appearance
with
a
cloudy
goldenorange
body
beneath
a
huge
head
of
frothy
white
foam
the
head
retention
is
excellent
and
it
leaves
brilliant
rings
of
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
nose
delivers
a
brilliant
combination
of
grainy
malt
and
floral
herbal
grassy
and
haylike
hops
the
body
is
medium
and
its
very
finebubbled
carbonation
gives
a
gentle
zest
to
the
tongue
before
fading
smoothly
away
the
flavor
is
really
nicely
balanced
with
rich
grainy
and
bready
malt
slathered
in
herbal
grassy
hops
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
its
a
little
bit
more
malty
than
many
examples
and
that
gives
it
an
edge
yet
it
still
manages
to
finish
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
lingering
dulled
bitterness
its
an
excellent
german
pils
with
its
bitterness
permeating
every
nuance
of
its
flavor
without
becoming
overbearing
brilliant
big
light
bubble
top
over
a
mostly
opaque
dark
orange
light
sweet
malts
and
lots
of
yeast
sharp
fullmouth
carbonation
and
watery
taste
some
malt
sweetness
and
wheat
character
and
an
unrefined
dirty
hop
bitterness
not
all
that
balanced
or
flavorful
pretty
boring
probably
excellent
with
food
id
imagine
however

goodlooking

the

passably
acidic
the

drinkable
and
a
pleasant
change

for
this
denison
of
the
dark
side
i
loved
this
very
cool
beer
hard
to
tell
exactly
what
this
bottle
says
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
liquid
with
a
big
thick
fluffy
head
the
head
stayed
forever
but
there
was
not
much
lace
on
the
glass
smells
grainy
and
lightly
floral
taste
is
quite
sharp

some
sweetness
light
malt
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
then
a
nice
crisp
floral
finish
carbonation
lots
of
it
and
body
light
were
appropriate
for
this
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty

very
drinkable
i
would
have
this
again
pours

barnyardy

good
dose

up

tartness
in
the
aroma
as
well
flavors
are
suprisingly
hoppy
for
the

and
the

this

this

beer
with

very
easy

nice
find
i
will
buy
again
sometime
thank
you
to
hart
at
the
creekhouse
for
this
suggestion
a
fine
german
lager
unfiltered
and
beautiful
quite
good
and
certainly
one
id
have
again
a
classic
lager
with
nothing
removed
highly
recommended
the
perfect
antidote
to
fizzy
watery
megaprocessed
common
macro
swill
hence
my
bud
comment
above
pours
a
slight
hazy
bronze
color
with
a
huge
mountainous
beige
head
very
active
carbonation
but
then
subsided
once
the
entire
contents
are
poured
theres
a
slight
twang
in
the
aroma
of
tartness
most
likely
from
the
fact
that
it
is
unfiltered
the
rest
of
the
aroma
suggests
breadiness
wild
yeast
and
hops
very
rich
for
a
lager
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
quite
pleasant
malty
feel
with
some
astringency
in
the
finish
hops
odd
im
going
out
on
a
limb
and
saying
it
has
a
farmhouse
feel
to
it
only
classic
german
lager
style
a
nice
artisinal
beer
very
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
good
german
lagers
appearance
its
uncanny
how
much
this
beer
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
but
its
an
unfiltered
lager
that
pours
a
hazed
deep
golden
orange
tone
with
a
nice
off
white
fluffy
mountainous
head
that
is
much
like
a
weizens
head
bubbly
and
effervescent
lacing
forms
here
in
thick
heavy
patches
evenly
rung
with
each
sip
excellent
aroma
mild
here
but
the
sweet
lighter
malts
used
here
give
off
a
semi
lemongrass
like
scent
its
soothing
with
some
balancing
hops
used
here
giving
it
a
slightly
herbal
quality
taste
flavor
has
a
soft
sweetness
bready
very
nice
hard
describe
butterscotch
like
sweetness
with
some
fruity
tones
but
than
it
finishes
witth
a
whopping
rush
of
dryness
immediately
cleaning
the
palate
forming
that
crisp
lager
quality
quite
bitter
in
the
end
as
well
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
in
body
spritzy
carbonation
tickles
the
back
of
the
throat
definitely
bringing
out
the
belches
drinkability
i
could
definitely
throw
back
some
of
these
especially
if
hanging
out
in
the
biergarten
at
mahrs
brau
would
be
good
times
indeed
this
bier
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
grain
with
some
vegetable
the
taste
was
grain
and
floral
hops
with
yeast
and
a
tangy
hoppy
finish
the
hops
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
there
was
a
lingering
faint
bitterness
this
was
a
good
refreshing
bier
fresh
from
the
tap
the
aroma
of
cut
hay
and
hops
is
fairly
pronounced
no
guessing
the
body
is
fuller
than
it
appears
a
fine
herbal
quality
rides
in
a
lightly
sweet
malt
a
mild
lemon
and
lime
tartness
along
with
a
bit
of
metallic
bite
provides
a
good
separation
of
flavors
early
in
the
pour
bits
of
yeast
float
about
in
suspended
animation
in
time
the
flavors
merge
blend
and
become
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
im
drinking
this
during
a
major
snowstorm
and
feel
this
would
be
an
excellent
warm
summer
night
beer
wish
i
had
a
nice

maybe
medium

not
that
medium

really
means
anything
to
anyone
besides
me
the

a
touch
yellow
it
puffs
up
big
and
pretty
thick
but
fades
away
after
a
minute
a
bit
like
a
hefe
the
aroma
is
malty
and
pleasant
nice
doughy
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
caramel
reminds
me
of
the
cismontane
single
malt
beers
that
ive
been
working
through
the
taste
has
a
good
dose
of
malt
sweetness
though
it
still
finishes
fairly
clean
with
a
very
light
grassy
note
its
a
relatively
rich
german
lager
less
hoppy
than
expected
smooth
feel
full
for
the
strength
solid
beer
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
not
terribly
dramatic
but
the
malt
flavor
is
very
nice
the
palate
opens
highly
carbonated
lending
a
yeasty
frothy
mildly
eggy
flavor
the
malt
is
dusty
doughy
mildly
caramelized
and
mildly
oxidized
the
oxidized
note
is
making
me
wonder
if
this
is
an
old
batch
thats
quite
possible
especially
since
its
been
what
two
years
the
hunter
was
released
the
midpalates
flabby
mildly
oxidized
dull
and
a
little
lifeless
adding
the
yeast
does
improve
the
feel
some
but
this
is
still
a
disappointment
medium
light
in

with

high
level

this
beer

gripes
aside
the
munich

character
is
awesome
and

doesnt

me
away

it

an
enjoyable
brew

a

o
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
compared
to
munich
helles
lagers
but
the
unfiltered
nature
and
complexity
in
the
taste
make
it
seem
more
reminiscent
of
a
keller
bier
or
a
zwickel
bier
gotta
love
the
picture
on
the
label
the
bottle
i
got
fizzed
from
hell
to
breakfast
so
be
prepared
it
pours
a
rich
and
slightly
hazy
amber

a
rather
thick
if
not
too
persistent
pale
ambertan
head
crisp
aroma
is
fruity
and
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
wood
flavor
is
typical
of
a
lager
malty
and
a
little
fruity

more
mouthfilling
and
rounded
out
again
there
is
just
a
hint
of
hops
texture
has
firm

and
good
fizz
better
than
with
many
lagers
i
have
tried
if
lager
is
your
style
uncork
this
beast
easy
going
but
in
a
good
way
the
flavor
is
malty
and
fruity
decently
fresh
a
zippy
kellerbier
very
fuckin
nice
bready
and
crisp
simple
and
seamless
medium
bodied
with
a
light
crisp
bitterness
that
dries
out
quickly
in
the
finish
fresh
floral
hop
notes
that
are
somewhat
subdued
but
complement
the
dry
crackery
malts
nicely
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
worth
a
try
from
this
quality
brewery
o
this
beer
surprised
me
i
just
bought
it
on
a
whim
i
like
mahrs
and
mastodon
the
band
is
okay
so
i
thought
what
the
hell
munich
helles
is
not
a
style
that
typically
hits
my
beer
gspot
but
this
one
really
did
the
job
on
a
hot
sunny
summer
day
carefully
crafted
very
well
done
color
me
impressed
slightly
sweet
this
is
a
malty
pale
brew
it
has
a
hop
spice
in
the
swallow
and
the
short
aftertaste
the
malty
flavor
is
dominate
but
there
is
no
grainy
flavor
the
body
is
like
skim
milk
the
carbonation
is
low
the
total
effect
makes
this
beer
seem
to
have
dried
fruit
o
this
is
a
well
made
beer
but
as
i
said
its
a
predictable
one
drinkable
but
not
much
separates
it
from
the
pack
edit
seems
it
really
was
a
limited
run
while
listed
as
a
kellerbier
if
i
had
to
categorize
it
id
call
it
a
franconian
lagerbier
that
just
happens
to
be
unfiltered
but
not
overly
yeasty
great
overall
very
drinkable
id
like
to
have
a
lot
of
this
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
foamy
head
that
reduces
to
a
film
smells
a
bit
noble
grassy
and
munichy
very
rich
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
touch
of
bittering
from
the
hops
honey
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
love
these
simple
styles
theyre
very
easy
to
appreciate
when
done
correctly
and
this
is
a
good
example
i
dont
know
how
limited
this
is
but
its
definitely
worth
trying

nothing

yes
a
mass
produced
beer
from
austrias
biggest
brewery
that
leaves
lace
and
a
fair
amount
of
it
flavor
is
a
bit
grainy
dry
and
light
not
a
flattering
description
but
actually
quite
good
is
complemented
very
well
by
a
bit
of
lemon
carbonation
is
full
though
today
is
far
from
warm
ive
finished
a
few
of
these
quite
easily

under
a
one

slightly
offwhite
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to

and
collar
but
is
too
thin
and
runny
to
generate
any
lace
the

is
strong
and
malty
with
a
definite
wheat
tone
along
with

the

is

quite
well
carbonated
mild
pleasant
enough
taste
slightly
sweet
at
first
but
primarily
dry
and
bitter
a
bit
of
rust
intruding
on
the
espresso
in
the
hops
theres
definitely
a
rough
edge
here
which
both
appeals
and
repells
the
aftertaste
is
spicey
bitter
lasting
long
as
it
fades
to
espresso
dry
not
bad
at
all
i
could
see
downing
a
few
pitchers
of
this
some
evening
a
draught
beer
sampled
at
the
brewery
tap
a
golden
slightly
hazy
beer
with
little
head
retention
of
a
white
head
initially
a
pale
maltysherberty
taste
following
through
as
the
hop
character
builds
to
a
medium
end
where
both
flavors
subside
together
in
a
slighty
sticky
end
not
a
bad
beer
this
zwickelbeer
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
with
a
soft
basic
pilsner
malt
base
and
moderate
floral
and
spicy
hops
i
just
wish
i
had
had
a
fresher
sample
to
enjoy
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
lots
of
doughy
and
bready
malt
for
sure
but
it
also
lets
the
hops
show
through
so
its
got
a
little
zip
in
its
step
the
midpalate
is
where
the
malt
and
spicy
hops
give
way
to
a
gentle
and
tasty
orange
marmalade
fruitiness
before
giving
way
to
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
and
yeasty
finish
impeccable
balance
and
harmony
of
flavors
too
i
cant
say
ive
had
very
many
zwickels
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
lot
go
out
and
get
some
now
this
is
a
real
solid
zwickel
quite
impressive
for
a
lager
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
orange
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
quite
appealing
to
the
eyes
scents
of
apple
juice
sweet
malt
doughy
bread
like
scents
and
yeast
nothing
to
out
of
the
ordinary
but
pleasant
flavors
of
sweet
malt
bread
yeast
and
an
undertone
of
german
hops
it
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
after
taste
that
balances
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
rest
of
the
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
like
a
lot
of
german
style
beers
ive
tried
this
is
a
very
good
very
unique
beer
in
some
ways
like
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
a
hefeweizen
i
like
it
a
lot
its
like
a
hefe
had
a
child
with
a
pils
drink
one
if
you
can
find
it
poured
into
a
12
liter
stein
a
hazed
deep
orange
tinged
golden
with
a
large
fluffy
white
crown
that
took
its
time
fading
into
a
frothy
mass
leaving
broken
rings
of
lace
behind
yeasty
and
doughy
aromas
with
a
tinge
of
ironlightly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
coating
but
not
heavyjust
very
smooth
mildly
sweet
doughy
flavors
with
a
hint
of
anisequite
yeasty
to
be
expectedfaint
iron
in
the
finish
iam
sure
this
is
as
food
friendly
as
all
get
outalthough
not
in
your
face
flavors
this
is
top
notch
for
the
style
furst
brings
it
o
ive
had
unfiltered
lagers
before
but
never
one
actually
called
a
zwickel
this
is
very
good
and
a
great
new
find
in
the
german
section
overall
a
nice
dusty
lager
it
looks
and
smells
pretty
average
but
it
does
have
a
fresh
invigorating
flavor
taste
is
musty
with
sulfur
notes
it
tastes
really
like
an
unfiltered
beer
with
too
much
yeast
in
it
the
doughy
notes
included
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
maltiness
that
has
some
decoction
notes
of
maillard
and
caramellized
products
pleasant
drinkable
smell
is
clean
taste
very
good
mildly
dry
and
very
drinkable
hazy
golden
beer
with
a
few
bubbles
rising
gingerly
along
the
edges
big
foamy
offwhite
head
has
a
creamy
top
and
leaves
thick
patches
of
lace
light
bready
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
crisp
citrus
fresh
out
of
the
fridge
there
is
almost
no
flavor
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
with
a
bite
at
the
end
but
thats
it
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
good
kick
of
fizz
after
you
swallow
a
little
maltier
as
it
warms
but
a
bit
stale
with
mildly
bitter
lemony
finish
fancy
bottle
fancy
label
mediocre
beer
nose
is
malty
sweet
and
has
the
typical
german
yeastesters
with
it
taste
is
full
malty
litle
maltsweet
before
getting
into
a
litle
bitter
but
very
clean
as
the
rest
of
the
brew
is
aftertaste
mouthfeel
isnt
overwelming
but
in
a
good
balance
drinkabilty
is
cause
of
the
finesse
of
the
brew
more
then
ok
good
beer
mo
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
that
i
have
no
problems
with
as
a
session
brew
andor
this
would
make
a
very
well
rounded
mealtime
beverage
i
find
it
to
be
medium
heading
towards
full
bodied
and
with
pleasant
fine
carbonation
that
lasts
throughout
the
taste
helping
to
burst
the
overall
flavors
onto
the
palate
it
certainly
has
a
nice
freshness
to
it
that
as
the
definition
of
this
style
suggests
should
be
there
if
this
was
available
to
me
at
the
stores
id
most
certainly
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
great
job
creemore
a
top
shelf
canadian
beer
i
love
it
poured
from
can
some
citrus
hops
aroma
cloudy
amber
appearance
with
white
head
light
bitter
taste
light
body
oily
texture
average
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
brew
me
and
the
unfiltered
beer
have
a
mixed
history
i
dislike
alot
of
beers
in
this
style
but
i
respect
creemore
and
have
greatly
enjoyed
their
other
offerings
i
purchased
a
sampler
type
box
of
three
sorts
of
creemore
this
is
the
only
i
havent
tried
and
iam
already
a
big
fan
of
the
pilsner
and
the
pretty
average
lager
didnt
leave
any
lasting
impressions
but
i
recall
it
being
quaffable
and
not
at
all
off
putting
just
lacking
charectar
maybe
anyway
not
sure
if
they
sell
this
keller
seperate
from
the
sampler
as
ive
never
seen
it
but
it
was
the
deciding
factor
for
me
creemore
is
a
great
brewer
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
slightly
simple
the
pilsner
is
the
best
of
the
offerings
but
given
a
couple
of
others
to
experiment
with
my
thoughts
may
change
in
this
this
keller
is
great
and
though
im
new
to
the
style
i
like
it
alot
overall
a
really
nice
beer
in
the
style
that
is
bright
and
lively
good
full
flavour
and
well
rounded
a
repeat
purchase
o
a
cleandrinking
easygoing
beer
extremely
lacking
in
the
aroma
department
but
it
tastes
great
as
a
quick
aside
i
love
the
brewerys
motto
proudly
100
years
behind
the
times
if
only
we
could
buy
its
kellerbier
at
100
year
old
prices
this
nice
little
beer
paired
well
with
cured
meat
and
cheese
this
beer
has
some
sweetness
to
it
but
not
enough
to
be
overbearing
or
unpleasant
and
even
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
was
quite
drinkable
sweet
berrylike
malt
up
front
good
white
pepper
hop
in
the
swallow
complex
full

with
a
low
carbonation

sidenote
this
was
difficult
to
review
as
ive
never
encountered
this
style
of
beer
would
love
to
find
more
of
the
same
though
the
beer
pours
cloudy
copper
with
a
huge
white
head
that
sticks
lacing
to
the
glass
scent
is
minimal
primarily
dominated
by
yeast
with
a
faint
hint
of
malt
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
lemons
caramel
grassy
hops
bready
malts
very
sweet
spicy
and
sour
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
medium
body
it
has
the
smoothness
of
an
ale
with
the
crispness
of
a
lager
overall
a
good
session
beer
final
thoughts
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
creemore
springs
catchphrase
on
the
can
is
a
hundred
years
behind
the
times
which
suits
this
style
perfectly
you
can
feel
the
history
of
the
style
and
why
it
was
saved
for
the
elite
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
and
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
overall
better
than
i
expected
very
refreshing
overall
nice
to
see
creemore
springs
expand
to
a
different
style
i
found
the
smell
to
be
quite
offputting
which
made
me
nervous
for
the
taste
nice
spice
yeast
and
hop
flavours
would
like
to
see
other
canadian
brewers
take
a
turn
on
this
style
get
this
into
bc
in
either
cans
of
in
six
packs
as
i
loved
the
slightly
brewery
funk
that
came
from
the
nose
and
the
way
the
beer
seemed
to
open
up
with
warmth
not
usual
for
most
lagers
i
found
grassy
notes
and
citrus
notes
depending
on
what
sip
i
was
taking
a
very
inventive
beer
from
creemore
m
light
body
great
carbonation
pretty
good
beer
here
an
interesting
style
and
quite
refreshing
nice
sweetness
that
doesnt
get
too
cloying
worth
trying
different
and
interesting
overall
mediumlight
body
but
full
of
flavour
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
for
the
summer
creemore
springs
kellerbier
pours
a
fairly
bright
gold
with
a
slight
haze
the
aroma
is
mostly
light
malt
with
a
bit
of
sulfur
i
would
guess
it
was
slightly
lightstruck
if
it
wasnt
from
a
can
there
are
some
nice
light
herbal
hops
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
nice
mild
herbal
hoppiness
and
a
bit
of
powdery
yeast
a
little
more
sulfar
pops
up
but
it
isnt
strong
enough
to
be
unpleasant
o
not
a
memorable
brew
but
still
well
made
and
refreshing
a
great
summertime
cold
one
for
lawnmower
fairly
light
body
and
carbonation
a
refreshing
balance
smooth
texture
very
fresh
and
fruity
tasting
for
a
fairly
dry
beer
a
bit
simple
but
very
nice
one
of
my
favourite
finds
of
2011
i
hope
to
see
it
again
but
it
is
sadly
becoming
harder
to
find
o
solid
like
all
the
beers
ive
had
from
creemore
worthy
to
be
considered
a
good
example
of
its
style
taste
light
fruity
hops
flavours
and
a
clean
amlt
profile
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
not
bad
not
a
big
fan
of
this
stuff
drinkability
easy
to
go
to
town
on
these
however
the
price
is
quite
steep
the
quality
is
very
good
though
which
has
caused
this
to
prominently
occupy
a
space
in
my
fridge
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
d
i
dont
have
any
other
kellerbiers
to
refer
to
but
this
seems
to
be
a
good
example
of
an
exceptionally
interesting
and
rare
style
of
lager
its
easily
drinkable
but
has
a
full
complex
flavour
profile
an
oddity
in
the
best
possible
way
o
generally
impressed
with
this
offering
it
is
extremely
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
very
enjoyable
on
this
hot
summer
day
o
certainly
a
refreshing
ale
and
fitting
of
the
style
the
flavours
are
bold
enough
to
be
memorable
but
mild
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
drink

i
really
quite
enjoyed
this
one
at
the
first
sip
i
immediately
regretted
picking
up
only
one
immediately
before
the
liquor
store
closed
although
it
has
a
full
body
i
think
the
light
flavors
would
also
make
this
an
ideal
session
beer

grade

a

on
the
lighter
cleaner
side
for
a
kellerbier
creemore
does
it
some
justice
o
my
favorite
from
creemore
very
tasty
for
my
only
stab
at
this
style
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
full
flavored
ipa
first
time
trying
this
style
no
idea
if
it
is
stylistically
correct
but
i
definitely
will
have
to
check
out
more
in
this
vein
cloudy
amberorange
with
a
nice
head
with
good
retention
smell
is
a
little
subdued
beautifully
refreshing
smooth
mouthfeel
i
often
have
a
problem
with
hoppy
lagers
in
that
they
come
across
a
bit
heavy
more
ale
like
but
this
is
refreshing
just
what
i
look
for
in
lagers
delicious
biscuity
walnut
malt
flavour
mixed
with
a
delicate
but
obvious

character
dry
but
not
very

quite

if
it
was
a

cheaper
would
be

go

always

seeing
this
come
around
definitely
something
ill
pick
up
again
when
im
in
toronto
d
a
great
summer
beer
that
has
held
up
well
but
is
now
a
little
out
of
season
a
very
refreshing
ad
flavourful
beer
though
i
was
terrified
that
molsoncoors
would
destroy
creemore
but
so
far
they
have
resisted
any
obvious
drastic
changes
long
may
they
remain
as
they
currently
brew
d
really
high
enough
flavour
to
keep
a
night
interesting
and
a
low
enough
abv
to
session
it
carbonation
might
get
to
ya
d
easy
and
smooth
going
down
nice
and
refreshing
i
would
have
quite
enjoyed
a
bigger
glass
of
this
definitely
one
to
stay
on
my
list
of
wants
overall
recommended
and
my
only
regret
is
that
it
waited
so
long
in
my
fridge
before
i
grabbed
it
price
gratis
at
the
brewery
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
another
good
beer
from
creemore
springs
drink
a
decent
effort
from
creemore
springs
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
one
that
i
would
probably
buy
again
hazy
orange
with
a
soapy
cap
of
white
foam
head
retention
was
average
but
it
left
a
lot
of
clumpy
lace
on
the
glass
malty
aroma
bready
with
some
caramel
lemon
citrus
hops
a
bit
floral
and
toasty
slightly
spicy
dry
biscuity
malt
up
front
with
solid
but
balanced
bitterness
nice
malt
flavours
bready
and
toasty
some
caramel
sweetness
follows
hop
flavours
were
earthy
lemony
and
floral
with
lingering
peppery
spice
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
quite
smooth
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
amount
of
flavour
and
character
jammed
into
this
beer
very
tasty
d
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
one
this
is
one
good
beer
this
has
become
my
favourite
from
creemore
it
makes
me
sad
this
isnt
a
yearround
beer
but
it
is
indeed
great
for
summer
extremely
drinkable
and
definitely
my
favourite
creemore
beer
hoping
molson
lets
them
make
more
fullflavoured
beers
like
this
one
d
pretty
good
nothing
outstanding
definitely
worth
keeping
in
my
fridge
a
good
find
hazy
copper
with
a
rocky
coarse
head
nose
is
caramel
herbal
hops
and
rough
graininess
dry
and
fairly
bitter
with
lots
of
nuttiness
and
hint
of
anise
raw
toasted
graininess
and
the
bare
hint
of
citrus
round
out
the
flavours
a
bit
of
a
slick
body
with
a
sharp
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
d
a
nice
beer
one
that
i
will
definitely
buy
again
d
gimme
gimme
gimme
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
hope
it
remains
easy
to
find
as
i
could
see
getting
it
quite
a
bit
given
the
selection
in
these
parts
very
fresh
flavorful
satisfying
and
clean
the
kegged
version
is
more
like
a
keller
with
less
carbonation
than
the
canned
version
hopefully
other
ontario
brewers
will
take
notice
of
this
beer
and
realize
that
lagers
dont
have
to
be
apple
juicelike
in
colour
and
waterlike
in
flavour
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
that
i
have
been
enjoying
immensely
cheers
d
goes
down
like
water
sessionable
citrusy
aromatic
inviting
newbies
expecting
an
ipa
should
not
drink
or
rate
this
beer
it
is
exceptional
for
the
style
not
if
you
compare
it
to
surly
furious
a
superb
and
quaffable
keller
bier
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
a
half
case
before
it
disappeared
dvery
drinkable
i
found
them
best
when
they
were
chilled
but
allowed
to
sit
for
about
10
min
out
of
the
fridge
im
a
big
fan
of
the
creemore
premium
lager
and
based
on
other
reviews
here
im
tempted
to
try
this
again
at
a
later
date
a
distinctive
beer
with
a
lot
of
things
happening
grassy
hops
minerals
fruitiness
earthy
malt
very
solid
quite
interesting
if
you
like
hops
youll
enjoy
this
not
an
extreme
hop
style
just
straight
up
enjoyable
poured
a
deep
cloudy
orange
colour
with
a
thick
white
head
the
head
dissipated
quickly
without
too
much
lacing
smell
is
of
grassy
hops
as
soon
as
it
was
poured
i
think
i
was
getting
a
bit
of
sulfur
but
this
was
much
more
muted
after
30
seconds
taste
has
a
light
bitterness
of
the
hops
with
some
sweet
bready
malts
quite
smooth
carbonation
level
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
i
think
i
enjoyed
last
years
batch
more
but
maybe
im
remembering
wrong
i
still
enjoy
it
and
will
buy
it
through
the
summer
smooth
drinking
clean
not
too
carbonated
but
still
sparkles
a
little
could
easily
sit
down
and
drink
the
8pack
this
is
what
summer
needs
never
rated
a
nonbock
lager
this
high
just
do
damn
drinkable
edit
i
had
to
up
the
drinkability
here
since
it
seems
ive
been
drinking
more
of
this
than
probably
any
other
beer
this
summer
and
it
definitely
sessions
well
not
too
bitter
this
stuff
is
damn
tasty
one
of
the
few
beers
ontario
can
boast
of
poured
from
a
473ml
can
into
a
pint
glass
can
dated
april
22
smell
is
hoppy
when
i
popped
the
tab
and
pours
a
dark
orangegolden
red
with
a
few
fingers
of
head
dwindling
to
a
thin
layer
with
minimal
but
chunky
lacing
again
smell
is
hoppy
and
slightly
spicy
taste
is
quite
good
too
not
too
bitter
although
it
finishes
pretty
bitter
floral
hops
earthy
malts
and
some
spice
again
pretty
organic
feeling
on
the
whole
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
has
quite
a
dry
aftertaste
drinkability
is
great
glad
ive
stocked
up
on
these
cans
picked
up
this
years
new
batch
from
lcbo
on
may
8
2010
i
was
excited
to
say
the
least
for
some
reason
last
years
peachapricot
bouquet
is
gone
as
well
as
the
bready
undertone
carbonation
is
markedly
increased
as
well
now
it
just
tastes
a
lot
like
creemore
lager
now
except
at
a
higher
price
disappointed
another
fine
brew
from
creemore
quite
enjoyable
this
time
of
year
not
really
a
session
brew
defionitely
one
to
take
some
time
with
and
enjoy
back
in
the
gwn
picked
this
up
citing
the
generously
hopped
proclamation
well
ill
be
the
judge
of
that
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
it
doesnt
smell
too
hoppy
smells
a
little
malty
earthy
pours
to
a
cloudy
pale
orange
with
a
foamy
creamy
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
kicks
into
gear
nice
naturally
fresh
taste
with
a
good
bitterness
throughout
this
style
and
this
beer
seems
similar
to
an
ipa
but
with
a
little
bit
thinner
backbone
and
a
more
earthy
hop
with
a
flatter
bite
the
taste
is
yeasty
due
to
the
lack
of
filtering
and
slightly
fruity
with
hints
of
banana
carbonation
seems
high
but
doesnt
detract
from
flavor
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
far
from
run
of
the
mill
final
thoughts
not
as
hoppy
or
as
hazy
as
i
remember
the
first
batch
being
however
still
very
enjoyable
im
not
sure
if
thats
due
to
the
fact
that
this
can
was
drank
within
the
first
week
of
it
being
offered
and
the
previous
one
was
towards
the
tail
end
of
the
previous
offering
as
my
first
kellerbier
i
am
pretty
happy
with
how
this
went
certainly
one
of
creemore
springs
better
lagers
can
poured
a
bright
lightly
hazy
copper
color
lager
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
caramel
malt
with
floral
undertones
and
some
clean
crisp
hops
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
floral
malt
with
notes
dry
caramel
and
a
light
green
hoppy
finish
body
was
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
very
well
done
though
additional
hops
would
have
benefited
this
beer
as
well
as
slightly
less
filtration
canned
sample
via
northyorksammy
pale
orange
in
colour
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
mild
citrus
herbal
hops
pale
malts
and
yeast
great
herbal
hop
flavors
dominate
the
palate
supported
by
tea
buscuit
like
malts
sublte
yeast
notes
and
a
hint
of
tart
orchard
fruit
fairly
dry
and
very
refreshing
on
the
finish
well
balanced
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
final
thoughts
as
my
first
kellerbier
i
was
impressed
but
can
also
see
the
lack
of
mainstream
appeal
this
style
offers
it
is
a
bit
oddball
but
its
good
none
the
less
i
could
see
this
going
good
with
seafood
or
sausage
but
really
this
beer
is
a
treat
beer
for
the
enthusiast
simply
put
worth
a
shot
thats
for
sure
overall
another
great
beer
from
creemore
first
time
having
the
style
and
maybe
it
just
takes
some
getting
use
to
i
still
prefer
their
lager
but
will
probably
purchase
another
one
of
these
down
the
road
d
easy
to
drink
first
time
i
have
even
heard
of
this
style
so
i
dont
fully
know
how
to
compare
it
the
style
discription
doent
really
help
prepare
me
for
this
beer
so
i
fell
that
giving
it
a
high
or
low
grade
would
be
unfair
tried
the
bottle
version
on
february
4th
2014
the
aroma
is
more
timid
than
the
canned
version
other
aspects
are
similar
nice
session
beer
for
the
summer
a
rather
enjoyable
oldschool
lager
made
right
in
rural
ontario
if
under
the
auspices
of
big
beer
but
theyve
apparently
been
set
free
of
any
purported
shackles
for
this
one
its
pleasantly
crisp
oh
shit
i
may
have
said
that
already
fresh
and
substantially
heady
too
bad
i
only
have
the
one
but
chances
are
molsons
canadawide
distribution
network
will
soon
address
that
minor
detail
overall
creemore
springs
hits
a
grand
slam
with
this
brew
a
good
example
true
to
the
style
tasty
and
awesomely
drinkable
the
only
flaw
in
my
opinion
is
that
it
may
be
just
a
tad
too
sweet
and
pricey
other
than
that
its
a
great
brew
this
is
a
fantastic
lager
only
my
second
example
of
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
the
good
balance
of
hops
malt
and
yeast
make
it
extremely
quaffable
one
of
the
best
ontario
beers
ive
tried
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
this
a
tasty
and
refreshing
summer
release
and
ill
be
picking
up
more
before
its
gone
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
crisp
hard
carbonation
superb
creamy
mouthfeel
possiby
from
being
unfiltered
and
a
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
this
is
one
of
my
new
favourite
styles
pours
a
very
lightly
hazed
dark
orange
some
copper
highlights
nice
and
thick
white
head
forms
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thick
ring
some
lace
chunks
stick
to
the
glass
smell
is
nice
very
malty
signature
creemore
breadiness
some
toasty
malts
and
caramel
earthy
some
floral
nice
light
citrus
hops
grassy
lightly
solvent
but
smells
good
taste
is
similar
dry
and
toasty
up
front
bready
caramel
sweetness
through
the
middle
very
grassy
hops
some
citrus
and
floral
touch
of
fruit
in
the
finish
almost
a
little
tannic
and
grapey
nice
dry
finish
solid
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
just
right
nice
lager
with
some
great
character
looking
forward
to
the
hoppier
batch
2
overall
very
happy
to
try
some
canadian
locals
and
my
first
kellerbier
thanks
again
eric
this
is
definitely
a
great
alternative
for
a
session
brew
d
a
very
good
drinker
mouthfeel
is
a
tiny
bit
overcarbonated
for
my
tastes
but
not
bad
overall
i
find
the
beer
refreshing
and
it
goes
down
quickly
smell
is
pleasantly
received
citrus
nose
with
fruity
aromas
it
smells
quite
good
taste
of
citrus
peel
bitter
fruit
zest
and
there
is
a
dry
cleansing
mouthfeel
i
found
the
finish
to
be
very
earthy
and
disappointing
and
didnt
score
the
drinkability
very
high
for
that
reason
hop
astingency
puts
the
finish
a
bit
off
balance
i
wondered
if
this
beer
was
too
fresh
overall
i
quite
liked
this
beer
until
the
finish
i
found
it
too
dry
and
sour
in
the
aftertaste
up
to
that
point
its
a
great
beer
by
me
but
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
of
it
id
probably
not
choose
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
can
deep
hazy
gold
with
orangey
hues
a
rocky
and
sticky
cap
sits
atop
the
liquid
and
leaves
nice
lace
yeasty
citric
nose
that
leads
to
fresh
and
pungent
hops
bread
crust
perfume
flavours
are
fresh
and
bright
lots
of
citrus
bready
malts
fresh
green
hops
markedly
spicy
with
a
floralherbal
quality
medium
bodied
with
a
subdued
sweet
fruity
finish
and
a
pleasantly
astringent
bitterness
that
lingers
complex
rewarding
and
very
drinkable
excellent
cheers
i
like
this
a
lot
better
than
their
pilsner
and
its
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
their
lager
i
hope
this
one
becomes
a
regular
a
winner
from
creemore
these
people
clearly
love
beer
despite
their
infamous
owners
md
mellow
little
carbonation
went
well
with
the
sun
finished
it
before
i
finished
typing
these
few
words
what
dose
that
tell
you
so
it
takes
creemore
backed
by
the
financial
might
of
molson
to
show
ontario
craft
brewers
how
to
make
a
lager
with
flavour
now
where
do
their
beers
fall
in
the
past
theyve
been
able
to
say
they
were
superior
in
quality
and
flavour
to
their
macro
rivals
but
now
theyve
been
surpassed
and
have
fallen
into
the
nomans
land
between
two
camps
having
neither
a
big
marketing
machine
nor
a
lager
worthy
of
note
sammy
may
be
right
this
could
be
a
paradigm
shifter
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
on
this
one
id
still
like
to
go
to
franconia
but
its
nice
now
that
i
dont
have
to
cash
in
any
air
miles
to
find
delicious
wellmade
kellerbier
by
sticking
to
traditional
guidelines
using
whole
leaf
hops
and
leaving
the
beer
unfiltered
and
unpasteurized
creemores
done
everything
right
from
delivery
boy
to
brewmaster
this
beer
makes
a
genius
out
of
the
whole
brewery
creemore

yeasty

and

medium

the

this
and

still
very
drinkable
significant

i
like
the
unfiltered

bang
on

it
hits
the
ontario
market
between
the
eyes
and
just
as
creemore
brought

in

about
20
years
back
this
will
be
a
paradigm
shifter
on

at
rattle

nyc
great
beer
first
aroma
on
the
nose
was
peach
yeast
esters
are
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
hefe
with
more
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
warm
and
rich
mouthful
with
a
malty
sweetness
it
can
only
be
described
as
chewy
wheat
the
most
grainy
yet
elegant
brew
enlivened
by
a
hoppy
hint
only
faintly
bitter
but
somehow
nicely
balanced
by
the
hoppy
twang
a
wonderful
quaff
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
summer
with
the
light
and
refreshing
characteristics
one
would
want
on
a
warm
evening
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
easy
put
down
a
couple
of
liters
in
a
single
session
pale
amber

slightly
cloudy
medium
poorly
retained
head
aroma
was

with

slightly
grainy

slightly
coarse
mouthfull

slightly
heavy
well
carbonated
overall
well
made
if
unspectacular
summer
beer
this
was
a
great
beer
i
felt
privileged
to
have
it
on
tap
at
a
german
bar
this
was
a
softer
more
flowery
beer
but
its
doesnt
let
u
forget
that
it
is
a
beer
and
a
good
one
overall
i
really
liked
it
and
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
if
they
ever
get
the
chance
to
try
it
the
2011
bachelor
party
extravaganza
has
moved
across
the
street
for
some
german
goodness
this
bit
pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
topped
by
a
healthy
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
banana
clove
white
bread
orange
zest
light
caramel
light
black
pepper
and
a
touch
of
minerals
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
heavy
on
the
breadiness
the
banana
and
orange
are
also
stronger
kicking
the
spices
to
the
very
back
of
the
bus
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
an
eversoslightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
tasty
little
summer
brew
one
that
provides
the
quench
of
a
hefe
with
the
slightly
increased
heft
of
a
larger
beer
good
times
palate
is
similar
to
the
aroma
plenty
of
yeast
character
that
contributes
mild
spiciness
and
fruit
bit
of
pineapple
very
bready
malt
backbone
mild
herbal
hoppiness
finishes
spicy
and
mildly
bitter
with
an
herbal
kick
feels
a
bit
chewy
and
thick
surprisingly
substantial
pretty
good
stuff
not
my
favorite
keller
to
date
but
quite
good
o
a
beer
that
is
excellent
for
a
warm
day
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
had
a
pint
at
brickyard
gastropub
in
manhattan
i
usually
love
the
style
but
wasnt
impressed
by
this
beer
it
just
came
off
like
an
indistinct
quasiwheat
beer
theres
was
nothing
crisp
about
it
it
just
felt
flat
the
malt
had
a
little
sweet
wheat
bread
character
with
mild
fruit
but
nothing
here
stood
out
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
bother
with
good
stuff
certainly
not
as
great
as
a
few
others
ive
encountered
but
an
absolutely
solid
take
on
a
kellerbier
if
anything
id
say
my
impression
of
this
beer
mightve
been
hurt
slightly
having
come
from
bamberg
a
day
or
two
earlier
its
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
kellerbiersungespundetes
up
there
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
eine
mass
bitte
do
i
still
think
the
hefe
weisse
is
the
best
hofbrau
beer
but
this
is
a
nice
alternate
and
my
2
hofbrau
beer
ill
probably
be
drinking
this
while
its
available
when
i
visit
the
hofbrau
overall
a
very
nice
german
treat
mfd
the
taste
is
pretty
incredible
and
i
loved
it
which
raises
the
drinkability
inevitably
the
body
is
wholly
medium
with
ample
carbonation
a
true
medium
blend
d
very
drinkable
and
classically
german
from
malt
to
yeast
to
hops
and
of
course
all
in
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
average
gold
and
opaque
with
a
limited
floral
scent
very
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
one
of
the
best
summer
brews
ive
had
served
in
a
dimpled
mug
a
slightly
opaque
orange
gold
body
with
a
fluffy
inch
of
foam
on
top
it
left
quite
a
bit
of
lace
and
looked
the
part
of
a
quality
german
bier
sort
of
grassy
and
light
pilsner
malt
aroma
flavor
had
a
light
hop
bitterness
and
fairly
full
body
a
shade
under
medium
dry
finish
it
kept
me
drinking
more
hard
to
pin
down
the
flavors
here
a
bit
of
german
yeast
gives
a
light
apple
flavor
to
the
cracker
malt
component
well
carbonated
and
an
easy
quaffer
rare
to
see
this
is
a
new
seasonal
around
these
parts
this
beer
feels
a
little
coarse
and
wet
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
weird
warming
effect
going
on
here
too
funny
that
i
did
not
see
this
beer
on
here
yet
i
had
this
once
at
zum
schneider
and
today
bought
it
in
a
growler
at
bierkraft
in
brooklyn
golden
with
a
frothy
white
head
looks
like
a
traidtional
helles
but
a
bit
more
murky
smells
of
bread
and
malt
very
good
flavor
malts
and
biscuit
ultra
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
i
could
have
pints
and
pints
of
this
on
a
hot
day
poured
into
well
a
stein
a
murly
tea
color
with
a
thin
minimal
headalot
of
chunkines
and
floaties
around
sweet
doughy
aromas
with
mild
toastfaint
lemon
is
detected
as
well
a
fuller
mellow
feel
is
nice
making
it
go
down
easily
sweetish
on
the
palate
with
carameldough
flavors
with
slight
drying
and
peppery
hop
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
its
not
up
there
with
the
better
traditional
kellerbiers
out
there
surprisingly
cloudy
caramel
and
a
touch
of
apricot
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
we
cardboard
caramel
taste
with
a
little
toffee
in
the
dry
finish
dry
very
easy
drinking
in
part
due
to
light
carbonation
no
head
when
poured
beer
goes
almost
flat
about
half
way
through
drinking
this
one
not
horrible
not
that
good
probably
just
old
and
poorly
kept
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
man
some
of
these
supermaltforward
are
pretty
shitbland
i
wonder
how
old
andor
wellcared
for
this
bottle
was
no
dates
on
the
labels
turbid
amber
with
blonde
highlights
when
backlit
and
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
fine
lace
on
the
glass
light
toasted
caramel
citrus
notes
and
herbal
hops
in
the
aroma
mild
malty
sweetness
and
a
nice
bit
of
caramel
no
doubt
from
the
addition
of
hot
stones
in
this
beer
medium
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
with
no
other
steinbier
to
compare
this
to
i
can
only
say
that
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
beer
that
has
a
really
hot
stone
dropped
into
it
but
you
cant
tell
the
process
has
taken
place
to
be
honest
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
not
out
of
the
ordinary
like
i
hoped
for
overall
a
fine
lager
here
from
the
leikeim
brewery
solid
german
brew
direct
from
the
source
id
love
to
pair
this
with
beer
simmered
sausage
and
kraut
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
that
results
in
a
supersmooth
and
semibubbly
mouthfeel
which
is
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
finishes
semidry
with
modest
stickiness
across
the
palate
dear
leikeim
please
double
check
the
assurance
of
your
sellby
dates
thats
two
ive
had
from
you
that
were
consumed
well
before
the
date
and
two
that
tasted
like
they
were
already
old
this
is
another
nogo
o
a
solid
sturdy
well
made
beer
drinkable
simple
straight
ahead
but
really
good
not
every
really
good
beet
has
to
have
a
million
flavors
going
on
give
me
23
really
good
ones
and
im
happy
o
very
good
drinkabilty
despite
its
peculiar
character
a
very
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
maybe
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
not
really
feeling
the
urge
to
have
it
again
similar
flavors
of
caramelized
malts
bready
and
smooth
not
all
that
sweet
really
lingering
multigrain
bread
notes
smooth
creamy
feel
and
medium
bodied
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
be
nice
if
there
was
some
smoke
to
it
though
if
it
is
in
fact
a
steinbier
picked
up
a
swingtop
bottle
from
euro
market
for
3
50
best
by
102012
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
short
white
head
theres
a
mild
yeast
bread
aroma
the
flavor
has
more
caramel
malt
than
most
keller
beers
im
not
picking
up
any
hops
character
but
theres
maybe
a
touch
of
earthyness
from
the
yeast
id
expect
more
character
from
a
kellerbier
this
is
too
bland
i
really
appreciate
the
painstaking
process
undertaken
to
brew
this
beer
but
in
terms
of
flavor
the
results
arent
that
spectacular
this
is
what
i
would
imagine
for
the
german
brewer
as
a
kellerbier
rustic
yet
somehoe
newage
hoppy
and
fruityspicy
its
as
if
the
brewer
brewed
it
and
kept
it
to
himself
because
it
turned
out
so
different
from
tradition
but
too
damn
good
to
share
fitting
in
with
a
style
that
was
the
brewers
reservethe
beautiful
bready
rusticality
mixed
with
the
modern
hoppy
touch
is
too
good
to
be
true
easily
one
of
the
best
zwickel
beers
ive
had
and
ive
drank
zwickel
in
farmhouses
in
bavaria
wow
all
i
can
say
its
a
smooth
brew
flavourfull
hard
to
find
style
but
very
interesting
the
drinkability
is
excellent
could
be
the
best
of
style
for
me
prosit
mk
taste
is
light
bready
and
biscuity
with
grains
and
a
hint
of
smoke
bitterness
is
low
at
first
but
when
swallowed
the
beer
leaves
a
slight
bitter
at
the
back
of
my
tongue
the
yeast
is
clean
and
only
adds
a
mineralic
twist
a
solid
brew
it
says
something
about
the
tradition
of
frankischen
kellerbiere
on
the
back
so
thats
the
style
i
went
with
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
lighter
compared
to
other
kellerbiers
but
is
still
quite
flavorful
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
am
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
so
i
am
not
sure
how
it
compares
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
not
a
bad
way
to
start
my
sunday
local
market
just
got
this
in
and
i
figured
i
would
try
it
pored
it
into
a
mug
from
the
bottle
resembled
caramel
in
color
very
very
smooth
with
a
full
body
taste
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
finish
definitely
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
and
try
it
toasty
aromamalty
with
some
mineral
essence
also
feel
is
crisp
and
slightly
sharp
though
it
smooths
out
quickly
in
the
end
pouring
in
the
yeast
adds
a
bit
of
fullness
to
the
body
toasty
nutty
malt
flavors
a
hint
of
dried
fruit
leather
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable
a
nice
traditional
take
on
this
historical
style
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
that
results
in
a
supersmooth
and
semibubbly
mouthfeel
which
is
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
finishes
semidry
with
modest
stickiness
across
the
palate
o
i
enjoyed
it
though
it
doesnt
have
the
overall
complexity
ive
found
in
others
of
its
style
worth
a
pickup
though
if
you
like
kellers
got
a
swing
top
from
euromarket
for
3
50
the
hopping
is
pretty
mild
but
theres
a
gentle
spice
in
the
finish
and
balancing
bitterness
its
a
maltier
lager
up
front
with
toasty
biscuit
a
hint
of
caramel
and
clean
grain
the
hops
build
slowly
in
the
finish
with
a
citrus
edge
but
otherwise
this
is
just
a
pleasant
balanced
and
hazy
lager
tm
again
corianderbut
it
is
smooth
for
drinkingunique
bavarian
hefe
style
despite
high
carbonation
rather
uncommon
in
kellerbiers
i
have
encountered
before
it
enhances
the
taste
in
an
interesting
and
pleasant
fashion
i
certainly
liked
it
and
would
buy
it
again
nice
experience
ive
been
trying
examples
of
kellerbiers
when
i
find
them
here
in
germany
an
interesting
style
that
produces
a
lot
of
flavor
for
modest
alcohol
leikeim
kellerbier
has
a
strong
bite
with
all
the
carbonation
and
is
very
refreshing
this
is
a
great
kellerbier
and
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
plenty
of
malt
flavor
for
style
hop
load
leaves
bitter
and
sweet
in
balance
but
contributes
little
to
the
flavor
until
the
nutty
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
but
flavorful
and
smooth
tasting
brew
quite
enjoyable
a
very
clean
beer
that
asks
you
to
keep
coming
in
for
more
this
is
bit
more
bitter
than
i
would
prefer
but
its
still
amazing
pretty
dead
compared
to
most
ive
tried
on
tapcask
some
things
you
should
seriously
have
fresh
o
20
for
5
liters
of
an
authentic
unfiltered
lager
yes
please
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
soon
as
i
said
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
modestly
carbonated
buy
it
o
a
very
delicious
beer
i
would
rate
it
above
kaiserdoms
but
its
very
comparable
would
pair
well
with
german
fare
delicious
in
hot
weather
glad
to
find
another
beer
in
this
style
cool
can
o
a
pretty
good
depiction
of
the
traditional
style
i
like
the
style
the
bottle
and
the
freindly
price
point

my

shop
id
have
this
again
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
subtle
but
flavorful
in
its
way
and
i
happen
to
really
enjoy
its
aroma
and
texture
i
feel
like
i
could
quaff
liters
of
this
stuff
o
lacking
a
wealth
of
flavor
but
the
simple
bready
composition
makes
this
one
enjoyable
if
you
know
what
you
are
asking
for
i
had
yet
to
have
a
beer
of
this
style
thus
my
opinion
may
be
skewed
i
would
get
it
again
different
take
on
the

o
an

the
highlight

is
amazing
its
very
drinkable
and
would
be
perfect

2nd
kellerbier
ive
had
i
thought
it
was
pretty
solid
after
mowing
the
lawn
funky
sourness
comes
and
goes
with
an
almost
kombuchalike
aliveness
slightly
musty
aroma
of
minerals
and
apple
later
its
all
shortbread
and
sweet
sticky
malt
flavors
are
similar
it
has
a
fairly
smooth
and
hefty
feel
to
it
once
the
yeast
was
poured
lingering
bready
aftertaste
primary
flavors
of
apple
fresh
yeasty
bread
and
dry
hay
it
has
a
bit
more
character
than
your
average
german
lager
but
its
pretty
sweet
and
slick
feeling
over
time
ok
to
try
and
compare
to
others
of
the
style
likely
not
a
repeat
buy
for
me
personally
5l
minikeg
it
is
a
hazy
orangeish
gold
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
light
and
grainy
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
bready
but
with
a
nice
touch
of
noble
hops
in
the
back
not
bitter
but
the
hops
are
noticeable
i
was
surprised
by
this
particular
one
tastes
like
it
smells
only
with
a
really
nice
smooth
surprisingly
hoppy
back
end
that
brings
everything
together
like
vanilla
ice
cream
big
nodes
of
bread
and
honey
mix
with
the
aforementioned
weird
nodes
it
is
old
but
the
age
doesnt
impart
any
bad
flavors
so
much
as
it
disrupts
the
balance
onot
terrible
very
very
drinkable
id
have
it
again
but
its
not
high
up
on
my
shopping
list
my
fatherinlaw
bought
a
minny
barrel
of
this
at
beers
of
the
world
for
us
to
drink
on
poured
a
hazed

was

but
that

was

so

its
crazy
i
liked
this
beerlight
but
not
wimpyincredibly
food
fiendly
overall
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
a
fairly
nice
beer
based
on
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
think
most
are
not
reviewed
to
style
or
the
reviewer
got
an
old
beer
mine
is
nice
and
fresh
and
a
fairly
decent
representation
of
the
style
if
not
world
class
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
straw
color
with
a
fairly
thin
white
head
that
leaves
somne
sloppy
lacing
clean
aromas
of
fresh
hay
and
soft
yeasty
notes
with
just
a
touch
of
fresh
baked
honeyed
bread
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
a
rounded
fresh
bread
flavor
lightly
pierced
through
with
some
subtle
noble
hops
fresh
like
this
it
is
quite
addictive
very
easy
to
approach
but
with
that
extra
something
that
keeps
drawing
you
back
very
pleasant
and
a
pleasure
to
find
this
at
my
local
bottle
shop
this
swing
top
bottle
pours
a
pretty
clear
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
soft
soapy
white
head
the
aromas
are
solely
of
sweet
pale
malts
and
light
honey
it
definitely
smells
like
a
light
lager
the
flavors
are
of
sweet
pale
malts
and
light
honey
its
pretty
heavy
grains
it
also
has
an
ever
so
light
bitterness
its
very
light
and
doesnt
offer
any
complexity
whatsoever
but
its
not
bad
and
decently
drinkable
it
drinks
fine
and
smooth
i
can
see
this
style
being
popular
in
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
its
just
ok
tried
this
at
the
split
rock
beer
fest
on
112110
they
had
a
bunch
of
the
veldensteiner
bottles
there
and
i
knew
that
id
never
tried
any
of
them
so
i
made
sure
to
get
them
all
under
my
belt
this
beer
turned
out
to
have
some
really
pleasent
aromas
on
the
nose
the
flavors
were
on
the
weaker
side
due
to
the
style
of
course
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
just
for
the
hell
of
it
it
was
a
good
sample
but
thats
about
all
for
me
this
was
a
new
addition
at
my
local
beer
store
figured
id
try
it
for
3
49
a
bottle
500
ml
swing

bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark

color
with
about
an
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
the
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
mostly
sweet
it
smells
like
grain
some
honey
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
the
brew
tastes
like
sweet
malt
grassy
and
herbal
hops
caramel
malt
and
some
breadgrain
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
hard
to
drink
this
brew
at
all
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
its
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
very
light
yet
not
boring
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
to
say
the
least
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
velvety
it
just
glides
down
the
gullet
i
like
this
and
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
it
supremely
drinkable
this
is
a
fine
beer
complex
but
enjoyable
its
easy
to
drink
but
it
has
the
interest
to
keep
you
coming
back

very

the
nearly

is
fascinating
where
does
it
come
from
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
since
it
was
meant
to
be
unflitered
and
cloudy
anyway
so
anything
that
i
may
have
stirred
up
was
not
going
to
make
a
difference
i
got
just
under
a

of

that
held
up
nicely
on
this
hot

afternoon
color
was
a

was
very
malty

quite
lagerlike
i
really
enjoy

lagers
these
days
mouthfeel
was
big
and
soft
not
full
per
se
but
quite
carbonated
and
the
taste
was
sort
of
tangy
like
wheat
may
have
been
involved
finish
had
a
lemon
citrus
quality
making
it
not
only
dry
and
refreshing
but
also
reinforcing
my
belief
that
wheat
may
have
been
involved
would
love
to
be
able
to
drink
this
all
the
time
especially
during
the
current
heat
spell
were
experiencing
o
overall
a
highly
drinkable
lager
with
a
really
nice

and
good

drinkability
and
overall
impression
an
easily
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
could
serve
well
for
an
evening
of
multiple
servings
along
with
dinner
and
conversation
with
friends
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
nicely
complex
beer
with
lots
of
interesting
flavors
that
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
to
have
again

good
carbonation
crisp

refreshing
nice
but
not
super
exciting
id
still
prefer
a
good

over
this
definitely
on
the
light
side
an
easy
drinker
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
lighter
germanstyle
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
substance
making
it
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
overall
nice
crisp
and
clean
soft
creamy
malts
hint
of
grassy
hops
very
drinkable
not
light
in
body
but
simple
in
flavor
it
is
quite
a
refreshing
beer
enjoyable
owas
at
a
new
bar
in
a
new
area
that
had
dozens
of
exciting
beers
i
only
had
the
time
to
get
one
beer
and
i
chose
this
due
to
my
ongoing
curiosity
of
the
style
i
was
sure
glad
i
did
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
a
joy
to
have
ill
be
searching
this
one
out
over
all
this
german
lager
has
every
thing
a
beer
geek
would
want
from
this
style
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
barely
and
light
body
besides
the
price
this
is
up
there
with
the
top
german
lagers
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
sort
of
thing
id
be
happy
to
drink
if
we
ever
get
warm
weather
again
yet
theres
a
real
depth
to
it
again
its
most
similar
to
an
unfiltered
pilsner
a
style
of
which
ive
only
had
a
few
and
im
not
sure
i
could
say
categorically
what
makes
this
beer
different
from
them
but
what
i
can
say
is
i
will
happily
seek
out
this
or
other
zwickl
beers
in
the
future
and
i
hope
american
breweries
start
making
some
drink
these
before
they
go
old
that
is
all
arcobräu
zwickl
lager
pours
a
very
pretty
hazy
golden
color
with
some
blond
hints
here
and
there
nice
fluffy
white
head
sparse
lace
smell
is
my
favorite
part
of
the
brew
it
smells
great
with
herbal
hop
scent
some
grain
with
a
nice
spicy
yeast
in
the
back
some
faint
fruitiness
and
just
great
scents
taste
does
not
deliver
based
on
the
nose
but
this
is
great
delicious
beer
european
herbal
hoppings
with
some
grain
apple
skin
faint
nuts
and
bready
yeast
backing
once
again
delish
feel
is
a
light
bodied
lager
with
some
nice
bubble
activity
and
a
crispness
on
the
tounge
this
is
great
beer
and
a
growler
on
a
sunday
would
be
an
easy
task
interesting
style
creates
a
very
easy
drinking
lager
nice
taste
dang
i
could
drink
these
all
damn
day
in
the
summer
lighter
bodied
but
over
carbonated
i
liked
this
but
way
too
fizzy
a
clean
crisp
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
being
that
this
style
isnt
very
pronounced
in
the
u
s
im
impressed
with
this
example
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
with
some
bright
white
head
cloudy
but
not
murky
nose
is
faint
with
some
flowery
notes
and
a
little
orange
palate
is
crisp
and
juicy
at
the
same
time
orange
blossoms
come
to
mind
great
full
mouthfeel
for
a
layer
really
enjoyable
beer
is
light
in
body
and
wet
on
the
palate
highly
drinkable
but
light
on
flavor
i
find
it
watery
a
little
and
wanting
something
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
earthy
bitterness
but
it
is
too
little
too
late
i
might
have
it
again
but
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
if
it
had
more
flavor
or
body
o
a
nice
summer
beer
or
session
beer
in
my
opinion
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
all
around
but
a
good
pick
overall
though
pretty
tasty
and
a
dense
dough
blast
that
comes
off
as
refreshing
pours
a
slightlyhazy
light
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
some
mild
lacing
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
very
light
hops
but
mostly
grainy
malt
too
much
grain
actually
the
flavor
is
mostly
raw
grain
and
base
malt
without
too
much
else
going
on
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
decent
enough
but
not
something
id
come
back
for
while
definitely
not
a
common
style
to
be
imported
into
the
us
its
one
that
is
admired
by
both
consum
ers
and
brewers
alike
slightly
yeasthazed
golden
hue
the
draping
of
white
lace
on
the
glass
is
an
amaz
ing
sight
faint
peppery
notes
with
grape
skin
freshcut
grass
and
bready
nose
refreshing
with
its
snappy
crispness
smoothness
ensues
in
the
back
of
the
lighter
body
fresh
dry
grain
and
light
nutty
yeast
meld
quite
well
together
hops
hone
in
for
balance
and
give
off
a
light
herbal
freshness
finishes
very
dry
with
a
clean
grainandyeast
aftertaste
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
although
theres
nothing
really
unique
about
the
taste
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
nice
little
beer
at
a
great
price
overall
pleasant
and
refreshing
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
quite
drinkable
the
beer
has
a
wonderful
light
crisp
malt
body
possibly
with
wheat
a
beautiful
touch
of
sweetness
with
notes
of
fruity
honey
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
sweetness
and
crisp
german
brewing
the
head
on
this
beer
is
amazing
retention
and
lacing
are
very
good
its
got
a
bit
of
chill
haze
which
seems
to
accentuate
the
dark
orange
colour
the
smell
is
characteristic
of
a
kellerbier
but
even
so
its
never
been
one
of
my
favourite
things
about
this
type
of
beer
it
smells
quite
musty
with
a
little
grass
and
sour
cherry
the
taste
is
actually
quite
neutral
refreshing
light
grainy
but
not
too
much
emphasis
on
either
the
malts
or
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
with
a
medium
body
its
hard
to
score
a
kellerbier
high
but
this
ones
one
of
the
better
examples
in
bavaria
overall
not
bad
i
really
like
this
style
but
i
would
like
to
have
even
more
of
those
complex
unclean
flavours
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
yeast
driven
flavors
and
moderate
spicy
hops
character
great
oone
of
the
few
ng
beers
i
did
not
care
for
its
a
wellmade
basic
lager
with
some
breadyyeasty
character
its
on
the
sweet
side
nice
brilliant
clarity
nice
white
head
not
familiar
with
the
style
fairly
grainy
aroma
flavor
is
grainy
and
bready
refreshing
with
a
minerally
clean
finish
nothing
spectacular
but
would
be
a
great
session
beer
in
a
hot
day
crisp
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hop
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
love
it
there
are
no
flaws
and
there
is
nothing
aggressive
its
perfect
for
me
on
hot
days
cracked
open
after
a
hot
bike
ride
home
from
the
office
the
aroma
is
a
simple
doughy
barley
with
a
hint
of
toast
and
caramel
and
the
slightest
earthy
mineral
touch
that
carries
over
into
the
flavor
with
the
malts
the
body
is
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
lowhop
czech
lager
or
a
lighter
dortmund
export
lager
than
a
kellerbier
but
its
a
damn
fine
beer
to
have
at
the
end
of
the
day
id
drink
more
if
i
had
one
but
i
dont
get
to
sconie
that
often
easy
drinking
lager
that
remains
flavorful
and
clean
without
the
twang
of
a
macro
light
fruits
balanced
by
some
noble
hop
hints
o
new
glarus
takes
the
classic
characteristics
of
a
german
lager
with
bavarian
hops
and
wisconsin
malts
to
make
yokel
an
unassuming
unfiltered
lager
thats
flavorful
but
easy
drinking
so
you
want
classic
wisconsin
as
they
say
buy
local
drink
yokel
update
still
a
good
drinkable
brew
but
during
the
second
sixer
the
sourdough
thing
started
getting
way
too
onedimensional
and
less
pleasant
even
though
i
was
mixing
things
up
during
the
period
they
were
tossed
back
and
alternating
styles
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
traditional
european
light
lager
nice
bready
malt
taste
with
some
good
subtle
hop
notes
the
beer
appears
crystal
clear
and
bright
golden
with
a
thick
soapy
white
head
aromas
include
sourdough
bread
lager
yeast
apple
lemon
lots
of
bread
and
yeast
character
packed
into
a
low
abv
beer
thin
body
with
moderately
low
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
smooth
lingering
flavors
of
bread
dough
and
yeast
a
hint
of
floral
hops
and
a
general
earthy
quality
a
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
another
magnificent
new
glarus
beer
a
great
craft
lager
that
is
stylistically
righton
the
malts
are
the
main
draw
here
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppiness
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
i
highly
recommend
it
for
craft
lager
lovers
tasted
like
a
cross
between
a
lager
and
a
cream
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
the
bite
could
be
from
bittering
hops
or
a
certain
type
of
yeast
im
not
exactly
up
to
speed
on
this
style
it
was
very
quenching
to
drink
it
was
complexinteresting
while
also
being
a
sessionable
beer
id
get
this
again
especially
at
the
price
point
o
decent
enough
stuff
but
not
one
of
ngs
better
lagers
actually
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
and
not
a
6pack
o
while
this
beer
is
clean
its
almost
as
if
it
is
too
clean
for
the
style
the
label
says
it
is
unfiltered

overall
although
this
didnt
break
any
records
for
great
taste
for
me
overall
i
liked
it
would
love
it
on
a
cool
morning
in
the
winter
not
bad
in
the
end
an
oversmooth
kellerbier
i
would
like
it
to
be
rougher
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
keller
bier
in
a
blind
test
i
would
call
this
an
altbier
the
tartness
carbonation
light
maltiness
all
fit
the
style
as
a
kellerbier
not
too
impressive
a
solid
and
very
refreshing
brew
just
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
friday
evening
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
lots
of
pilsner
and
lager
style
flavors
to
include
the
husky
tastes
and
feels
of
a
good
keller
bier
bb
oct05
great
white
foam
thats
thick
as
whipped
cream
and
beautifull
and
very
clowdy
golden
beer
smell
is
fresh
very
hopflowery
h
mittelfrueh
or
saaz
together
with
litle
maltarome
of
palemalt
and
some
yeastesters
making
it
a
good
nose
taste
is
litle
empty
alcoholic
and
malty
still
the
fresh
and
flowery
hops
noticable
making
this
one
enjoyable
hops
are
good
but
there
is
a
litle
yeastbitterness
in
the
aftertaste
not
that
disturbing
though
and
the
brew
overall
gives
a
fresh
and
flowery
mouthfeel
but
be
aware
of
the
alcohol
cause
it
drinks
like
lemonade
cheers
this
was
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
my
second
keller
experience
my
first
keller
and
i
have
to
say
that
im
not
fond
of
the
style
maybe
it
grows
on
you
so
i
will
try
it
again
given
the
opportunity
as
it
is
hard
to
find
these
the
beer
is
clear
maybe
a
little
haze
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
few
fingers
of
foam
the
aroma
is
just
dead
on
bready
and
grainy
rich
and
malty
perfect
ive
had
only
a
handful
of
lagers
that
smell
quite
this
appealing
the
flavor
was
the
same
just
like
liquid
bread
delicious
a
little
sweet
upfront
and
only
a
little
bitter
in
back
very
balanced
but
malty
the
grains
come
through
in
a
great
way
heavy
body
for
a
lager
but
still
easily
chugable
any
lover
of
german
lagers
should
be
happy
with
this
one
drinkability
was
incredible
prior
to
this
i
hadnt
had
much
experience
with
the
style
so
i
thought
i
might
have
been
overrating
this
at
first
however
after
quite
a
few
other
pours
from
different
casks
it
became
clear
that
this
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
and
a
great
great
beer
in
its
own
right
i
imagine
that
this
is
the
way
that
beers
used
to
be
hundreds
of
years
ago
its
light
in
body
creamy
in
the
mouth
has
a
slight
bitter
edge
at
the
back
but
no
aftertaste
finishes
wet
some
mild
yeastiness
and
some
mild
graininess
its
super
drinkable
its
crisp
but
on
this
occasion
i
stopped
at
the
brewery
in
mönchsambach
the
beer
was
so
fresh
and
the
lady
of
the
house
friendly
it
was
a
great
beer
all
around
the
beer
was
amber
in
color
and
nearly
clear
and
then
dries
out
in
a
flash
all
of
these
elements
play
well
together
this
is
quite
a
nice
keller
bier
tante
hanni
with
plentiful
bubbly
white
lacing
aroma
is
pale
malts
and
crisp
hops
taste
is
sweet
pale
malt
with
a
crisp
hops
and
mineral
are
all
in
balance
easy
to
drink
sweet
herbs
and
grass
intermixed
in
the
background
nice
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
had
a
thicker
than
expected
consistancy
nice
good
drinkability
i
hope
that
i
can
find
this
in
the
summertime
real
nice
drinkability
in
this
beer
nothing
harsh
or
off
about
it
just
a
well
crafted
beer
with
some
nice
complexities
probably
one
of
the
most
impressive
lagers
ive
had
no
that
thats
been
many
props
to
beerpanther
for
bringing
this
into
the
store
appearance
is
light
cloudy
yellow
at
the
bottom
of
the
wizen
glass
and
turns
a
couple
shades
more
orange
as
the
glass
widens
at
the
top
and
when
the
label
says
natural
beer
thats
exactly
what
you
see
in
the
body
lots
of
particles
swirling
and
swimming
around
respectable
head
too
for
smell
i
get
a
good
fresh
hefe
smell
hints
of
orange
maybe
even
a
little
lemon
but
no
banana
like
some
hefes
yeah
i
know
this
is
not
a
hefe
but
the
smell
is
not
distinctly
pilsner
either
tasted
is
nutty
a
bit
of
almond
classic
citrus
tang
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
mild
hops
and
great
balance
mouthfeel
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
felt
like
a
lot
of
german
fresh
beers
sometimes
i
find
them
over
carbonated
and
burp
after
every
sip
sure
the
carbonation
adds
to
the
refreshing
sensation
but
this
beer
does
it
without
the
excess
foam
on
the
way
down
great
balance
great
mouthfeel
and
a
refreshing
flavor
equals
a
high
drinkability
in
my
book
the
one
think
keeping
this
beer
from
a
better
score
is
that
nothing
stands
out
to
grab
my
attention
almost
as
if
this
beer
is
lacking
a
distinction
lacking
a
character
in
the
car
world
this
beer
would
be
a
toyota
camery
solid
reliable
hard
to
hate
does
every
technical
attribute
perfectly
a
perfect
transportation
module
but
where
is
the
passion
and
soul
this
is
a
lager
correct
this
is
absurd
amounts
of
depth
and
breadth
in
a
nonale
if
you
cant
vouchsafe
for
freshness
id
be
wary
of
buying
this
especially
if
not
refrigerated
i
dream
of
drinking
this
even
fresher
on
draught
in
franconia
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
and
again
as
ive
secured
an
option
for
50
bottles
i
hope
no
one
else
latches
on
to
it
ive
really
been
digging
the
german
biers
recently
i
got
a
hold
of
this
one
from
a
friend
who
raved
about
it
and
i
must
agree
that
it
is
in
fact
raveworthy
pours
a
bright
gold
color
though
it
doesnt
have
the
usual
clearness
of
a
typical
german
lager
there
are
literally
bits
of
yeast
or
grain
suspended
in
the
murky
straw
colored
beer
some
might
view
this
as
a
flaw
i
just
think
its
interesting
didnt
have
a
grainy
mouthfeel
at
all
by
the
way
it
was
silky
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
smell
and
taste
have
a
distinct
almost
meadlike
honey
characteristic
up
front
lots
of
peppery
spices
and
a
bit
of
funkyness
to
this
one
really
bizarre
excellent
spicy
hops
hallertau
saaz
just
a
guess
all
of
this
is
backed
by
an
awesomely
light
german
maltyness
almost
wheaty
like
i
said
before
this
one
is
ultra
smooth
and
nice
and
light
on
the
palate
and
uber
drinkable
i
doubt
if
ill
ever
come
across
this
beer
again
but
ill
definately
be
on
the
lookout
and
ill
be
exploring
this
style
a
little
more

o

didnt
seem
to
have
all
of
the

that
you
normally
get
from

a
zwickelbier

the

much
lighter
in

than
expected
just
a

on

off

forward
a

comparatively
of

brings
forward
some

a

this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
so
far
from
weissenohe
how
i
wish
this
beer
were
a

more
available
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
could
see
myself

while
on
the
nose
theres
a
fresh
earthy
hop
character
with
a
rich
malt
backbone
with
caramel
and
honey
clean
this
is
almost
a
hybrid
of
a
kellerbier
and
a
marzen
the
palate
opens
mildly
bitter
with
an
earthy
hop
character
ridiculously
deep
there
are
flavors
of
caramel
honey
bread
burnt

a

the
finish
is
dry
and
long
lasting
with
a
blend
of
bitterness

this
beer
is
a

to

a
slightly
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
great
lacing
smells
largely
of
caramel

earthy
tastes

with
plenty
of
earthiness

even

expect

this
is
what
an

unfortunately
a

of
corn
tall
foamy
pale
tan
colored
head
faded
slowly
tastes
like
dough
and
raw
grains
mixed
with
a
butterscotch
corn
hybrid
the
flavors
of
a
landbier
are
there
but
in
the
wrong
proportions
and
a
bit
out
of
whack
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
hardly
any
carbonation
a
mild
beer
that
manages
to
be
to
sweet
maybe
some
more
hops
would
balance
it
out
and
cover
up
some
of
the
corny
bits
one
is
enough
for
me
its
an
ok
beer
to
drink
probably
a
bit
special
in
its

this
has

5
70
euro
is
not
equivalent
to
this
beers
quality
a
surpriseingly
broad
flavored
keller
for
something
that
was
such
a
clear
look
this
is
a
keller
that
seems
to
have
a
character
all
its
own

the
distinction
its

a

not

not

to
have
for
the
keller
community
a
beer
with
character
clean
finish
light
mouthfeel
refreshing
d
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
ive
had
a
few
others
from
weißenoher
but
this
one
stands
far
above
the
rest
dvery
drinkable
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
could
find
it
great
with
food
this
drinks
easy
without
as
much
cellar
tang
as
other
kellers
whether
that
makes
it
a
better
or
worse
example
of
the
style
im
not
sure
but
i
enjoyed
it
poured
into
a
seidel
glass
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
copper
color
that
was
produced
but
it
was
a
pleasing
appearence
the
smell
had
a
little
maltiness
but
overall
it
smell
rather
metallic
and
somewhat
bitter
the
taste
by
far
was
the
most
disappointing
part
at
the
start
it
made
an
attempt
to
have
some
spice
that
vaguely
resembled
a
beer
like
gose
ohne
bedenken
however
this
quickly
turned
into
bitterness
and
a
really
poor
aftertaste
for
a
kloster
beer
this
was
pretty
bad
poured
a
tall
foamy
pale
cream
colored
head
that
left
a
few
strands
of
lace
deep
copper
colored
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
glow
to
it
light
caramel
malt
in
the
aroma
with
metallic
note
to
it
rich
malty
flavor
like
a
maibock
watery
but
full
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
with
a
good
dose
of
flavor
simple
and
easy
drinking
i
dont
think
this
bottle
was
expired
since
the
complete
lack
of
sediment
or
turbidity
tells
me
that
what
was
filled
into
this
bottle
was
not
representative
of
their
normal
product
i
wonder
if
a
really
old
keg
was
used
to
fill
it
or
if
something
went
awry
in
the
filling
lines
regardless
it
points
to
questionable
quality
control
and
i
will
not
be
buying
again
this
is
appears
to
be
my
first
authentic
kellerbier
i
looked
up
the
style
to
get
some
frame
of
reference
this
one
seems
to
fit
the
description
for
the
most
part
pours
a
fairly
cloudy
deep
dark
amber
with
a
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
mainly
sweet
with
some
yeast
taste
is
very
sweet
like
carmel
and
honey
with
some
toasted
malt
similar
to
a
sweet
fresh
baked
dark
bread
also
crisp
like
a
pilsner
and
a
very
faint
hop
bite
finishes
with
a
lingering
candy
sweetness
almost
like
some
sort
of
sugar
coated
cereal
nice
lager
im
still
learning
about
these
kellerbiers
but
i
enjoy
this
one
i
think
i
need
to
delve
into
this
style
much
more
to
learn
just
how
well
this
beer
represents
it
price
point

9
oz
swingtop
bottle
o
all
in
all
a
good
brew
but
not
very
noteworthy
would
be
better
as
a
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
than
all
on
its
own
like
i
had
food
pairings
soft
pretzel
sausage
mashed
potatoes
slow
roasted
beef
this
sort
of
reminds
me
of
dampfbier
a
bit
but
a
lighter
sweetness
which
is
more
noticeable
and
a
good
fruity
character
to
it
also
however
this
is
not
what
i
normally
want
out
of
a
keller
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
id
gladly
indulge
in
again
overall
i
cant
get
very
excited
by
this
beer
way
too
malty
for
my
palate
and
the
mouthfeel
was
flabby
overall
ok
highly
drinkable
as
there
are
no
harsh
edges
would
tire
of
these
after
two
but
still
worth
trying
overall
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
that
weird
flavor
right
up
front
though
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
for
me
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
lots
of
malt
sugars
in
this
beerlike
dissolving
a
malt
ball
in
the
beer
very
little
hop
the
body
is
thin
the
carbonation
high
the
iron
is
also
in
the
taste
think
watered
down
scotch
ale
even
though
this
is
a
lager
o
kinda
fun
to
try
but
leaves
me
unimpressed
ill
try
it
again
it
warmer
months
when
im
sure
itll
be
reprieve
from
the
lawnmower
beers
but
theres
not
much
good
i
can
say
about
it
now
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
rye
and
oats
with
a
soft
finish
close
to
grapefruit
quite
drinkable
without
any
aggressive
carbonation
pleasant
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
scents
of
barley
and
yeast
are
the
most
noticeable
you
can
really
find
the
barley
as
it
is
very
grainy
tasting
quite
earthy
and
mellow
flavor
that
gives
this
beer
great
drinkability
some
attributes
that
i
can
see
people
pointing
out
is
i
do
find
the
volume
to
be
a
little
too
thin
and
the
after
taste
is
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
as
it
is
sort
of
chalky
drink
for
a
style
ive
never
had
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
as
the
bottle
i
feel
has
fallen
off
a
little
bit
id
like
to
trade
for
a
surly
hell
to
compare
d
i
thought
these
werent
supposed
to
be
clear
regardless
drinkable
and
tasty
clean
not
a
wower
but
still
an
easy
drinking
lager
d
a
very
light
beer
with
high
carbonation
level
an
easy
drinker
that
would
go
down
well
over
the
summer
overall
interesting
style
and
it
grew
on
me
as
i
finished
it
off
i
do
wonder
though
if
this
was
fresh
ill
have
to
revisit
this
style
again
when
i
know
for
sure
the
beer
is
fresh
and
see
if
my
review
changes
any
not
an
outstanding
beer
definitely
above
average
but
nothing
special
but
again
the
bready
flavor
grew
on
me
after
awhile
hence
my
slightly
higher
rating
on
the
overall
category
pours
a
crystal
clear
orange
with
a
1
inch
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
small
rings
of
lacing
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
smells
of
carameltoffee
and
biscuitlike
malt
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
coming
in
on
the
finish
very
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
quickly
fades
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
german
beer
and
my
first
of
both
the
style
and
from
this
brewery
i
had
been
searching
everywhere
for
a
beer
of
this
style
so
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
one
dvery
easy
drinking
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
profile
hurt
the
drinkability
in
that
it
isnt
a
super
complex
or
interesting
beer
id
like
to
give
this
one
a
try
again
if
i
could
find
a
fresher
example
o
i
didnt
really
appreciate
my
first
kellerbier
but
this
is
much
better
basically
im
getting
a
plain
amber
malt
taste
with
a
touch
of
a
caramel
either
this
beer
has
been
on
the
shelf
too
long
or
its
just
kind
of
plain
however
the
dates
arent
notched
on
the
label
theres
a
touch
of
hops
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
pale
euro
lager
than
a
pilsner
overall
a
nice
slightly
complex
and
unusual
beer
perhaps
overly
malty
for
many
this
beer
appears
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
white
froth
of
foam
on
the
surface
the
aromas
are
a
bready
yeast
nose
mixed
with
light
apple
juice
and
a
touch
of
banana
the
flavor
is
mostly
comprised
of
the
apple
juice
and
what
may
even
be
a
touch
of
corn
syrup
though
i
hope
thats
not
true
its
decent
on
the
palate
seems
to
go
down
rather
smooth
though
it
may
be
because
of
the
watery
nature
this
beer
is
highly
underwhelming
but
still
decent
im
a
little
confused
i
thought
this
style
should
have
a
cloudy
appearance
from
the
yeast
in
suspension
but
this
beer
was
quite
clear
a
really
lovely
beer
ive
had
many
zwickl
and
keller
beers
in
austria
and
this
one
is
pretty
tops
granted
a
lot
of
the
ones
i
had
were
massproduced
crap
that
my
father
in
law
drank
however
i
managed
to
have
a
few
decent
ones
but
this
ones
malty
sweetness
fits
right
in
with
my
liking
the
wheat
still
stands
out
and
combines
well
with
the
sweetness
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
that
has
you
finishing
the
beer
quickly
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
satisfying
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
kellerbier
d
ubberdrinkable
this
is
light
sweet
and
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
very
nice
for
such
a
unique
style
worth
checking
out
again
for
an
easy
drinker
their
website
has
some
nice
info
on
the
old
family
brewery
that
makes
this
stuff
drinkability
is
ok
i
have
had
other
examples
of
the
style
and
they
were
thicker
d
a
little
darker
and
heavier
then
you
would
expect
from
your
average
kellerbier
interesting
and
different
but
when
i
think
of
kellerbier
i
think
of
a
light
and
crisp
summertime
drink
with
a
sharp
and
pronounced
crispness
and
light
citrusy
touch
this
was
more
malty
and
fruity
almost
bock
like
at
times
more
suited
for
the
fall
season
pours
a
nice
light
brown
with
a
fairly
good
head
very
warm
caramel
smell
and
nuttiness
i
drank
it
with
a
few
apps
and
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
depth
and
thicker
mouthfeel
i
wish
they
would
put
a
little
more
into
this
beer
as
it
is
very
good
but
feels
like
it
could
be
excellent
abv
was
very
good
and
the
carbonation
was
neutral
not
sharp
at
all
very
nice
well
worth
a
try
great
kellerbier
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
overall
average
session
beer
without
much
interesting
going
on
could
be
passed
over
di
understand
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
its
not
for
me
an
easy
drink
german
beer
that
is
low
in
alcohol
good
stuff
i
picked
up
a
fliptop
bottle
at
a
gas
station
on
my
way
to
zugspitze
similar
to
a
nutbrown
light
cola
brown
color
fizzy
soda
head
that
settles
down
into
large
floating
bubbles
malty
sweet
aroma
very
smooth
tasting
and
i
think
a
great
session
beer
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
a
short
lived
off
white
head
it
is
a
dark
amber
color
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
there
is
no
complexity
here
its
just
a
simple
beer
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
an
amber
dingy
wood
color
of
a
pour
with
a
nice
head
of
bigger
bubbles
a
nose
of
a
lot
of
german
malt
stale
apple
pie
palate
was
that
exactly
with
a
bitter
quality
of
earth
and
a
sour
mild
of
plum
as
it
get
warmer
the
nose
brought
out
a
lot
of
plum
and
this
seems
to
be
a
part
of
the
whole
thing
i
would
expect
more
of
a
cellar
wood
hop
quality
and
a
tad
more
of
an
interesting
sour
smokey
zing
a
good
start
a
hard
style
simple
solid
tasty
good
value
dnice
beer
but
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
my
taste
wish
hop
balance
was
there
or
more
pronounced
drinkability
i
could
have
chugged
this
bier
in
two
gulps
it
must
have
been
lagered
to
death
and
you
really
do
get
the
feeling
that
this
was
stored
in
a
cellar
or
a
cave
for
a
few
months
tasty
and
very
authentic
a
watery
brew
with
a
light
body
and
light
effervescence
generously
call
this
a
decent
beer
with
no
oomph
and
little
for
either
the
nose
or
palate
its
drinkable
beer
hall
beer
i
guess
i
wont
buy
another
anytime
soon
until
i
forget
how
disappointed
i
was
so
which
keller
beer
do
i
remember
so
fondly
pours
amber
with
a
light
wispy
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
nothing
the
aroma
is
mostly
bread
with
some
toffee
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
bread
with
some
nuttiness
and
finishes
semidry
its
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
tasty
highly
drinkable
but
nothing
special
salinte
ttastes
like
cherry
coke
it
has
an
alcohol
heaviness
to
it
very
black
cherry
taste
interesting
taste
but
kind
of
bland
it
could
either
use
some
aging
or
some
hops
d
very
cleanly
made
beer
ive
never
had
a
kellerbier
before
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
beer
has
some
of
my
favorite
doppelbock
flavor
components
but
in
a
lower
alcohol
lighter
body
and
less
mouthcoating
package
this
would
make
a
great
everyday
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
carbonation
is
okay
and
drinkability
is
high
but
isnt
a
beer
style
im
too
ecstatic
about
still
fine
though
cool
swingtop
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
bronzecolored
and
clear
completely
nonkelleresque
small
beige
head
fizzles
out
pretty
quickly
aroma
and
flavor
are
both
basically
munich
maltiness
there
is
a
tiny
aspirin
note
in
the
finish
along
with
some
substantial
astringency
on
the
palate
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
kellerbier
closer
to
an
oktoberfest
or
dunkel
0
5l
bottle
from
gourmet
haus
staudt
poured
into
an
andechs
tumbler
clear
and
coppercolored
the
small
frothy
head
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
collar
this
is
oddly
clear
and
free
of
sediment
for
a
kellerbier
it
looks
more
like
a
dunkel
lager
to
me
toasted
malt
dark
fruitlike
esters
and
a
faint
mineral
twang
make
up
the
aroma
its
toasty
fruity
mildly
sweet
and
caramelly
on
the
palate
theres
a
moderate
hop
bite
to
it
as
well
earthy
in
character
the
finish
is
faintly
mineral
hoppy
toasty
semisweet
at
first
but
ultimately
drying
this
is
a
perfectly
decent
beer
but
its
hardly
a
kellerbier
more
of
a
hoppy
dunkel
perhaps
clean
and
drinkable
but
fairly
unremarkable
this
one
is
eminently
quaffable
but
the
over
all
flavor
can
be
quite
elusive
this
would
make
an
excellent
chaser
for
a
nice
single
malt
scotch
another
good
beer
from
this
brewery
this
beer
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
style
but
its
still
drinkable
regardless
recommended
for
the
price
its
not
bad
not
an
epic
beer
but
a
decent
cold
mug
type
brew
would
probably
have
again
taste
is
nice
toasty
barley
mineral
hint
of
caramelly
toastiness
leafyherbal
elements
faint
earthy
hint
up
front
with
a
zestyleafy
and
faintly
lemony
finish
it
is
balanced
with
a
zesty
character
and
feel
d
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
but
its
not
a
kellerbier
if
i
were
a
marketing
man
id
describe
it
as
a
hoppy
munich
amber
id
definitely
drink
another
one
of
these
but
please
dont
call
it
a
kellerbier
which
should
be
cloudy
yeasty
and
have
much
less
carbonation
drinkability
a
minimalt
bombwith
nice
and
sweet
caramel
tones
i
will
get
this
again
and
could
have
several
per
sitting
anyone
who
likes
maltier
beers
should
give
this
a
try
pours
a
crystal
clear
bronze
color
with
a
small
offwhite
colored
head
rather
small
but
leaves
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
is
very
doughy
like
a
munich
helles
a
bit
buttery
some
honey
sweetness
and
a
spicypeppery
grassy
hop
not
as
doughy
in
the
flavor
more
of
a
caramel
malt
presence
some
buttery
funk
rust
finishes
with
a
grassypeppery
hop
the
feel
is
moderate
with
active
carbonation
finishes
fairly
light
and
sweet
unlike
others
that
i
have
had
for
the
style
from
my
limited
experience
with
the
style
this
seems
to
be
a
bit
below
average
it
has
the
traditional
munich
malt
flavor
but
also
has
some
funkgrainyveggie
flavor
to
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
body
to
fit
the
style
either
meh
ok
might
be
better
off
picking
up
a
good
helles
lager
the
fruity
side
of
german
lager
is
here
in
this
beer
worth
trying
out
if
youre
into
trying
german
beer
sweet
corn
and
grain
aroma
vaguely
like
honey
and
bread
just
a
touch
musty
a
bittersweet
bready
flavor
also
fairly
mild
and
thin
barely
any
bitterness
and
certainly
no
hop
flavor
or
aroma
its
slightly
more
full
bodied
than
a
pilsner
but
not
by
much
pretty
inoffensive
easy
enough
to
drink
just
not
much
complexity
or
unique
character
to
set
it
apart
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
but
its
not
bad
not
bad
but
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
seek
out
an
easy
drinker
here
simple
and
not
highly
refined
but
pleasantly
drinkable
rich
taste
the
hops
come
in
quick
and
fast
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
the
the
caramel
malt
and
sweetness
attack
its
crisp
and
clean
sweetness
a
small
hint
of
smokey
in
then
end
slight
aftertaste
very
nice
rich
beer
with
a
smooth
easy
drinking
not
really
my
style
but
very
nice
disclaimer
time
this
is
my
first
kellerweiss
i
read
the
description
of
the
style
and
tried
to
write
my
review
based
on
my
own
personal
enjoyment
as
well
as
my
understanding
of
the
style
i
do
not
know
if
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
keller
bier
i
do
know
that
i
would
drink
it
again
d
another
good
keller
love
this
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
mediummoderated
carbonation
im
no
expert
at
defining
beer
styles
but
im
pretty
certain
this
is
not
a
kellerbier
more
fitting
as
a
dunkel
it
is
brown
clear
as
a
bell
and
has
no
hints
of
yeast
however
it
is
a
adequately
tasty
beer
d
drinkability
is
fine
could
have
a
bottle
or
2
in
a
sitting
but
i
was
expecting
the
richness
of
a
kellerbier
so
im
just
a
little
disappointed
honestly
this
could
probably
pass
for
smithwicks
or
viceversa
drinks
pretty
well
breadiness
is
smooth
overall
this
would
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
to
introduce
somebody
to
the
style
but
there
are
better
i
am
not
that
impressed
by
the
beer
its
timid
nature
doesnt
lead
to
much
depth
or
complexity
its
simplicity
isnt
refreshing
or
crisp
enough
its
a
very
weak
dunkel
d
this
was
my
first
beer
of
this
type
so
i
dont
know
how
close
it
fits
its
style
for
me
the
most
unique
aspect
was
the
mineral
water
flavors
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
it
easy
to
consume
multiples
a
nice
beer
overall
amber
nice
head
recedes
fairly
quickly
smells

herbal
hops
taste
has
bready

herbalgrassy
hops
nutty
some
toffee
there
could
be
somewhat
of
a
mineral
quality
perhaps
from
the
water
but
maybe
im
just
not
used
to
german
hops
flavor
is
assertive
but
not
bold
a
small
flash
of
bitterness
hits
midway
through
the
taste
followed
by
a
pleasant
mild
lingering
sweetnesslight
light

light
carbonation
maybe
im
also
just
not
used
to
session
beers
because
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
my
first
time
trying
a
keller
bier
and
i
quite
like
it
not
overly
flavorful
but
more
complex
than
most
german
lagers
ive
tried
and
very
easy
drinking
exceeded
expectations
appears
a
slight
caramel
hue
copper
bronze
like
tone
to
it
with
an
off
white
minimally
beige
head
floating
thick
nice
evenly
coated
lacing
as
i
take
each
sip
from
this
brew
aroma
has
a
mild
caramel
toasted
malt
character
going
on
i
was
expecting
unfiltered
brew
from
something
labeled
as
a
kellerebier
sadly
thats
not
the
case
here
another
semi
sweet
mildly
toasted
malt
lager
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
floods
the
light
herbal
hops
tones
flavor
is
semi
roasty
with
some
caramel
notes
just
barely
coming
through
and
sort
of
a
tart
character
in
the
finish
that
actually
works
okay
in
this
situation
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
flows
well
on
the
palate
drinkability
overall
isnt
bad
this
beer
has
a
high
sugar
concentration
with
some
residual
sugars
definitely
being
returned
through
the
high
fermentation
d
its
certainly
sessionable
like
i
mentioned
i
go
back
to
this
beer
fairly
often
if
you
like
good
malty
slightlysweet
german
lagers
that
arent
overly
toasty
youll
love
this
beer
good
beer
got
this
bottle
a
couple
a
weeks
ago
at
sams
in
chi
poured
with
a
light
tan
foamy
frothy
head
and
no
lace
head
lasts
a
while
color
is
a
brownish
dark
amber
aroma
is
toffee
malt
leather
a
bit
toasty
and
a
hint
of
hop
flavors
about
the
same
smooth
mouth
filling
body
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
not
over
sweet
malty
finish
session
beer
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
held
my
interest
throughout
my
first
experience
with
a
keller
bier
so
unfortunately
i
dont
have
something
to
compare
it
to
appearance
is
a
light
amber
fairly
clear
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
fades
with
almost
no
lacing
light
malty
aroma
taste
is
pleasant
if
not
exactly
memorable
light
drinking
a
little
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
finishes
quite
cleanly
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
worth
trying
at
1
99bottle
but
not
something
id
search
out
intentionally
tastes
like
it
smells
crisp
wonderfully
balanced
big
caramel
starts
things
off
moving
into
a
weedier
more
zwickeltype
middle
ending
with
light
hops
nice
springtime
beer
right
here
drinkable
soft
sweet
beer
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
like
honey
water
perfect
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
a
must
try
for
any
german
fan
and
has
a
cool
bottle
too
this
is
a
good
beer
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
you
wont
catch
me
seeking
it
out
but
its
worth
a
try
its
also
something
you
might
use
to
ween
someone
off
of
macro
lagers
it
has
good
flavor
but
its
not
overly
flavorful

down

there
is
a
lazy

initial
stinging

scent
comes
off
sweet
and
grassy
a
bit
musty
and
strong
a
little
sticky
to
the
palate
but
medium
bodied
and
pleasant
bready
with
a
good
heaping
of
sweet
malts
are
the
dominant
flavors
yeasty

a
solid

very
pleasant
and
interesting

id
make
a

out
of
though

much
like
their

little

that
settles
quickly
the
color
is
a
very
standard
amber
there
is
no
yeast
cake
in
the
bottle
like
their
wheat
beer
varieties
smells
malty
the
flavor
is
a
tastey
sweetness
good
drinkability
comparing
the
lager
and
keller
im
not
sure
which
i
like
better
as
they
are
very
similar
in
tastes
good
beer
but
like
all
the
moosbachers
they
are
a
bit
pricey
considering
there
is
nothing
too
special
about
them

would
be
fine
to
get

off
of
if
you
could
find
it
ultra
cheap
but
not
the
type
of

you
want
to
enjoy
a
homecooked

try
the

if
you
can
its
worth
a

this
is
a
pretty

kellerbier
that
i
think
would
be
much
much
better
if
it
was
fresher
too
bad
we
have
such
a

on

not
bad
but
nothing

rather
blandish

wouldnt
bother
getting
it
again
drinkability
low
alcohol

fairly
straightforward
flavors
make
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
will
try
again
but
will
seek
others
out

into

it
gave
off
about
an

dropped
down
fairly
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
the
color
is
a
nice
rich
clear
golden
brown
the
smell
was
faint
at
best
but
what
of
it
there
was
was
malty
sweet
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
an
earthy
flavour
that
lingered
very
little
hop
presence
in
this
one
but
it
does
have
a
slight
bitter
crispness
in
the
finish
i
like
it
though
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
anything
to
actively
seek
out
however
for
the
2
dollars
i
paid
for
the
bottle
i
certainly
got
more
than
2
dollars
worth
of
enjoyment
it
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
work
well
as
a

the

the

the
taste
is
good
it

clean

goes

good

this
is
a
good

im
lacking
knowledge
of
the

but
from
the
bros
description
this
really
doesnt
fit
well
its
not
cloudy
the
hop
bitterness
is
low
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
unfiltered
all
in

a
pretty
good

i
like
this
a
lot
it
seems
stunningly
fresh
and
just
recently
arrived
in

so
thats
probably
the
key
strange
and
wonderful
id
definitely
like
to
try
more

this

goes
down
very
well
it
has
a
smooth

mouthfeel
and
it
leans
pretty
heavy
on
the
malt
side
i
was
surprised
that
this
tasted
rather
fresh
and
i
enjoyed
this
example
of
this
hard
to
find
style
d
a
good
example
of
the
keller
style
although
a
little
darker
than
i
expected
at
a
moderate
alcohol
level
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
paired
well
with
indian
dinner
i
had
as
sweetness
of
the
beer
balanced
and
cut
through
the
spicy
food
this
may
not
have
been
the
best
match
but
it
seemed
to
work
overall
a
good
thirstquenching
beer
looks
nice
smell
was
amazingly
malty
sweet
goes
down
average
finishes
with
a
really
unnatural
aftertaste
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
aftertaste
but
it
was
almost
metallic
or
medicinal
i
suspect
it
wasnt
a
bad
batch
that
it
was
intended
as
so
but
i
could
be
wrong
d
as
far
as
drinkability
it
just
wasnt
for
me
its
not
that
it
is
necessarily
a
bad
beer
just
not
great
or
what
i
expected
i
can
easily
finish
the
bottle
but
would
not
make
an
effort
to
try
again
however
i
always
encourage
everyone
to
try
a
brew
regardless
of
others
reviews
as
everyone
has
their
own
preferences

knows
you
might
like

there
are
more

than
i
expected
given
the

there
is
a
very
pleasant
balance
between
the
hops
and
the

enjoyable
d
the
lightness
of
this
lager
and
the
interesting
grainy

are
enough
to
keep
me
sipping
at
the
subtlties
so
id
have
to
say
its
a
fairly
drinkable
brew

find
that
came
in
a

poured
this

into
a

at
48
degrees
the
beer
had
a
nice
pretty

the
smell
was

bready
and
yeasty
like
dough

something
being

the
taste
was
slighly
sweet
slighly

i
will

overall
an

almost
reminiscent

this

if

please
try
it
a

to
the

overall
impression
i
dont
want
to
give
the
impression
this
is
a
bad
or
watery
beer
but
the
taste
was
just
very
neutral
a
pleasant
little
beer
one
i
could
session
without
complaint
but
there
just
no
wow
about
it
in
the
end
i
was
impressed
if
somewhat
disappointed
that
i
didnt
find
something
more
exciting
of
course
it
all
makes
sense
the
malt
that
theyre
using
would
surely
mimic
what
was
being
produced
in
the
early
1900s
and
given
their
location
to
the
southwest
of
munich
a
brown
semimalty
ale
would
have
still
been
the
norm
for
a
german
beer
this
is
really
good
t
grassy
saaz
hops
toast
caramel
and
biscuit
mineral
water
helps
it
trend
toward
the
middle
carapils
malt
gives
a
neutral
flavor
not
bad
not
earth
shattering
i
imagine
this
as
a
cross
flavor
wise
between
a
dunkel
and
pilsner
a
very
sweet
pilsner
nothing
offputting
if
a
bit
corny
would
taste
horrible
warm
would
like
to
taste
some
other
examples
of
the
style
overall
everything
about
this
beer
is
below
average
there
are
notes
of
apricot
and
butterscotch
on
the
nose
and
tongue
but
they
are
masked
by
more
unpleasant
characteristics
such
as
iron
and
yeast
overall
it
is
a
very
curious
beer
that
has
a
unique
profile
while
it
does
not
present
any
new
flavors
it
does
combine
them
ina
unique
way
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
will
search
out
for
high
c
osurprized
by
the
taste
this
beer
was
great
this
is
a
relatively
fruity
smelling
zwickel
lager
from
bavaria
it
has
a
good
aroma
and
is
quite
tasty
with
a
touch
of
nutty
yeast
over
a
solid
malt
base
mouthfeel
is
this
lagers
weak
spot
well
i
got
this
at
my
local
place
mixed
and
matched
it
seems
above
the
taste
of
a
typical
lager
but
not
by
much
strictly
picked
for
its
interesting
cover
art
rjt
pours
a
hazy
deep
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
little
to
no
aroma
whatsoever
in
the
taste
a
small
caramel
like
note
but
really
nothing
at
all
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
caramel
note
in
the
aftertaste
lack
of
flavor
and
taste
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
more
keller
beers
in
the
future
this
is
a
great
recommendation
to
folks
who
like
a
sweeter
beer
or
a
wheat
beer
was
great
for
after
dinner
sitting
on
the
back
porch
in
the
summer
night
in
the
taste
semi
sweet
flavors
of
euro
malts
mild
citrus
hop
bread
and
has
a
mild
peppery
character
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
texture
overall
this
makes
for
a
nice
little
keller
beer
in
the
darker
range
of
the
style
gonna
guess
this
is
old
no
discernable
dating
on
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
unless
i
was
in
the
country
of
origin
drinks
alright
at
best
the
taste
was
on
the
malty
side
and
appeared
one
dimensional
in
flavour
i
expected
a
lot
more
to
be
honest
thin
and
lacking
in
substance
for
a
5
2abv
brew
the
hops
just
didnt
show
at
all
no
bite
or
crispness
to
the
brew
im
struggling
to
find
anything
nice
to
say
about
this
beer
so
ill
curtail
the
review
now
o
pretty
good
stuff
unlike
the
beers
i
usually
find
myself
drinking
yes
definitely
bready
ohso
smooth
wow
the
yeast
makes
for
great
drinking
here
it
is
great
to
have
a
yeasty
german
brew
that
is
not
a
wheat
beer
pleasant
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
malts
border
on
chocolate
but
mostly
stay
in
the
caramel
range
i
am
digging
on
this
i
got
this
as
a
single
but
will
certainly
pick
up
a
sixer
next
time
i
am
downtown
o
a
soso
german
brew
never
had
this
style
might
seek
out
others
but
not
zeppelin
kind
of
reminds
me
of
yuengling
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
interesting
d
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
not
a
pleasant
trip
tasted
like
coors
banquet
with
some
better
hops
i
wont
be
ordering
another
of
these
any
time
soon
my
first
venture
into
the
keller
bierzwickel
bier
category
i
love
it
its
like
a
hefeweizen
or
wit
bier
on
steroids
kind
of
a
ho
hum
beer
all
the
way
around
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
carbonation
is
weak
making
the
beer
slicker
then
i
prefer
i
say
pass
this
one
by
if
you
see
it
conclusion
a
very
solid
little
beer
it
tasted
like
a
very
refined
lager
that
is
it
had
a
more
softer
polished
finished
compared
to
other
lagers
ive
had
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
made
me
want
to
explore
the
keller
bierzwickel
bier
style
atmosphere
is
pretty
nice
pretty
nice
rich
look
and
a
thick
tight
head
nose
has
a
variety
of
grain
tones
nothing
profound
but
nicely
balanced
flavor
again
grain
filled
goodness
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
quaff
thanks
to
wagenvolks
for
the
extra
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
sweet
malts
burnt
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
fruit
with
a
nice
kick
of
brown
sugar
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
one
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
and
would
certainly
have
again
lets
face
it
kellerbiers
arent
the
prettiest
lagers
of
the
bunch
but
sometimes
looks
are
overrated
zeppelin
is
quite
the
tasty
brew
its
a
real
lager
in
the
raw
the
rustic
nature
of
this
brew
makes
for
an
enjoyable
quaff
probably
not
quite
as
bad
as
i
make
it
sound
but
i
cant
really
describe
it
any
better
either
ie
i
will
drink
the
other
5
bottles
but
i
will
probably
never
buy
this
beer
again
the
kellerbiers
are
interesting
lagers
that
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
form
the
helles
or
dunkel
you
could
also
replace
an
okto
with
this
one
a
cloud
stale
orange
color
something
between
a
hef
and
duklewiess
really
nose
is
german
lager
yeast
and
a
mild
sour
apple
funk
mild
floral
sweet
sort
of
wheat
malt
and
hop
blend
in
odor
licorice
no
banana
though
palate
is
apple
with
a
funky
grit
of
something
astringent
acidic
a
mild
sweet
some
pollen
and
clove
not
smoky
like
an
alt
on
the
brink
of
herbal
unstable
bitter
funk
and
germany
body
great
style
consistent
example
nice
body
tastier
than
expected
thats
for
sure
zeppelin
packs
on
the
flavor
with
lots
of
browned
fruit
flesh
notes
from
the
yeast
hops
taste
zesty
and
alive
on
the
palate
with
a
refreshing
bite
that
lingers
into
the
finish
and
suggests
mildly
pine
and
orange
peel
malts
boast
a
superb
balance
of
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
again
very
musty
and
organic
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
aggressive
at
times
leaving
the
tongue
raw
with
effervescence
overall
i
found
zeppelin
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
damn
tasty
german
import
recommended
not
a
bad
beer
an
interesting
experience
for
a
first
time
with
this
style
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
iced
tea
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
grapes
wheat
grass
and
flowers
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
wheat
grapes
and
flowers
with
a
somewhat
earthy
finish
it
almost
resembles
dirt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pours
a
nice
hazy
straw
colour
with
a
thin
head
the
nose
presents
a
sweet
honey
with
cereal
and
lemon
teh
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
same
attributes
coming
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
hard
mineral
water
i
think
its
fairly
well
balanced
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
o
an
rather
odd
style
but
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
the
pithymineralmetallic
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
tough
to
think
about
drinking
more
than
one
but
for
one
bottle
i
find
it
to
be
really
pleasant
and
different
this
is
beer
14
from
the
rieder
advent
calendar
pale
yellow
hazy
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
grassy
and
i
swear
i
smell
cotton
candy
the
flavour
is
really
quite
sweet
with
a
cloying
wheat
finish
whatever
its
an
average
wheatbased
lager
not
bad
not
great
too
sweet
to
session
a
pretty
tasty
germanstyle
lager
im
liking
these
less
commonly
available
styles
from
that
country
and
its
immediate
neighbours
obviously
more
and
more
as
of
late
could
see
sessioning
this
one
in
a
bierhalltype
establishment
some
day
i
could
smash
a
few
of
these
with
no
problems
at
all
well
rounded
beer
that
id
drink
often
if
available
in
something
other
then
my
100
advent
calendar
while
the
bottled
versions
always
show
a
few
signs
of
age
that
cant
be
helped
i
will
still
pick
this
up
again
if
i
see
it
half
finger
head
with
little
retention
and
decent
lacing
on
a
clear
golden
body
light
malt
aroma
not
getting
much
on
the
nose
flavor
is
sour
citrus
with
wheat
and
malt
this
is
my
first
of
the
genre
i
like
this
one
but
cant
really
judge
it
on
its
quality
amongst
others
in
the
genre
light
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
and
pleasing
beer
while
the
style
does
not
seem
to
be
produced
or
available
much
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
happily
accept
another
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
amber
with
large
head
that
dies
quick
and
some
lace
has
a
dry
pilslike
grainy
malt
aroma
along
with
burts
of
citric
hops
reeal
light
and
dry
as
the
pils
malt
makes
it
pleasant
and
balances
w
a
touch
of
yeast
so
the
beer
remains
smooth
w
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
is
a
touch
of
minor
floral
hoppiness
in
the
body
as
well
and
it
finishes
nicely
with
a
crisp
backbite
overall
a
simple
but
real
good
beer
to
relax
with
o
the
green
bitterness
is
the
dominate
flavor
with
the
rest
of
it
being
very
soft
and
a
bit
of
a
metallic
quality
is
off
putting
o
a
beautiful
golden
brew
unfiltered
hazy
thirst
quenching
and
sweet
d
a
solid
drinkable
beer
i
have
respect
for
the
style
and
this
beer
but
not
one
id
want
to
do
very
often
i
perfer
my
lagers
to
be
cleaner
prepare
for
expensive
session
beer
fantastic
in
its
own
sense
but
one
dimensional
when
too
old
fuller
bodied
than
expected
and
very
earthy
up
front
with
floral
pine
hop
bitterness
and
a
prominent
zesty
spice
character
hints
of
peppery
coriander
and
clove
followed
by
bread
yeast
that
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
as
well
as
banana
and
citrus
peel
a
bit
too
spice
heavy
overpowering
the
other
flavors
and
an
astringent
metallic
aftertaste
hurts
drinkabilty
i
preferred
this
much
more
on
draft
brauerei
hofstetten
krammer
kubelbier
isnt
exactly
lackluster
but
its
close
once
the
hops
fade
this
stuff
will
go
downhill
like
a
fat
kid
on
greased
sled
runners
wolnzacher
hell
naturtrub
and
st
georgenbrau
keller
bier
are
still
the
best
european
versions
of
the
style
to
have
entered
my
glass
t
the
taste
echos
the
aroma
as
usual
but
it
takes
a
turn
a
few
sips
into
it
the
taste
buds
adjust
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
the
hops
become
more
prominent
theyre
more
spicy
than
the
nose
suggests
and
along
with
a
solid
bitterness
they
round
it
out
nicely
it
starts
with
rich
malt
thats
gently
caramelish
and
toasty
and
then
the
hops
kick
in
with
a
spicy
dryness
and
lots
of
floral
notes
rather
than
finishing
sweet
it
actually
ends
up
being
fairly
dry
and
refreshingly
bitter

the
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
but
finishes
a
little
dry
its
interesting
and
odd
there
is
almost
a
tartness
to
it
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
highly
drinkable
a
pretty
good
keller
simply
a
good
beer
well
executed
d
definitely
an
interesting
beer
very
true
to
the
style
kellers
at
least
ive
never
had
a
zwickel
and
a
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
complexity
always
a
fun
style
for
me
a
great
old
fashioned
germanic
lagerbier
it
is
a
good
beer
the
best
kellerbier
i
have
had
as
of
yet
d
the
unfiltered
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
rather
tasty
i
would
definitely
want
to
try
this
beer
again
a
decent
lager
though
i
expect
an
imported
bottle
isnt
as
true
to
form
as
a
fresh
cask
t
that
is
a
wonderful
malt
taste
vegetablegrain
tasting
it
has
a
nice
hop
kick
once
in
and
a
crisp
clean
aftertaste
this
was
a
small
slice
of
heaven
overall
a
nice
keller
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
with
and
have
a
bottle
or
2
for
sure
cuz
it
is
an
easy
drinker
cool
d
a
tasty
unfiltered
brew
i
would
like
to
try
more
beers
of
the
style
to
get
a
handle
on
wether
it
lives
up
to
my
assessment
i
have
a
had
a
handful
and
this
seems
like
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
a
highly
drinkable
beer
pours
a
five
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
slightly
hazy
amber
color
some
malt
some
hops
nose
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
woody
and
hoppy
lingering
bitter
after
taste
4

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
d
drinkability
was
fairly
enjoyable
by
the
pound
but
wouldnt
venture
much
after
that
middle
of
the
road
overall
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
abv
was
not
listed
but
it
did
not
seem
high
the
carbonation
was
just
right
nice
balance
the
beer
finished
clean
and
i
didnt
feel
full
afterward
id
definitely
have
another
if
it
were
nott
so
expensive
an
allaround
good
beer
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
vom
fas
decent
bier
nothing
exceptional
found
at
premier
pours
light
body
although
very
decent
creamy
offwhite
head
neutral
aroma
mouthfeel
is
average
taste
is
ok
drinkable
but
not
very
drinkable
to
the
extent
of
500
ml
being
unfiltered
led
to
something
but
not
all
that
much
overall
a
nice
session
beer
a
lager
with
a
little
bit
more
oomph
would
probably
drink
it
again
if
it
were
less
expensive
overall
this
was
a
great
impulse
purchase
the
big
bottle
is
just
the
right
size
and
this
is
a
surprising
sipper
nothing
youd
chug
but
it
seems
like
you
should
be
able
to
a
grown
up
beer
for
sure
and
not
a
campfire
swiller
by
any
means
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
d
wow
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
session
beer
i
know
im
stretching
the
term
session
here
im
my
mind
the
experience
drinking
this
brew
is
comparable
to
what
michael
jackson
describes
as
a
restorative
refereshing
satisfying
big
chewy
mouthfeel
and
totally
sessionable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
for
days
on
end
this
is
lovely
stuff
i
served
this
in
a
mug
the
beer
was
an
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
honey
aroma
taste
was
honey
fruity
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
crisp
in
the
mouth
a
refreshing
beer
one
that
i
would
like
to
drink
again
nice
beer
for
the
summer
try
it
partly
cloudy
golden
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
went
down
to
a
collar
i
did
not
get
much
of
an
aroma
nor
flavor
either
for
that
matter
kind
of
a
sweetish
lager
feel
was
mediumlight
bodied
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
a
beer
that
10
years
ago
i
would
have
downed
six
without
blinking
an
eye
and
been
very
satisfied
my
how
the
tastes
have
changed
while
still
a
good
beer
there
are
too
many
better
kubelbier
just
doesnt
stand
out
a
good
keller
beerzwickel
beer
is
hard
to
find
but
i
think
this
austrian
one
is
pretty
solid
poured
a
slight
hazed
light
golden
with
a
nice
two
finger
crown
atop
that
never
completely
settled
aromas
are
of
honeytoasted
grainand
a

note
a
rather
hefty
mouthfeel
but
not
overly
sojust
full
and
lush
flavors
are
alot
like
the

a
bit
of
doughtoasty
and
crisp
in
the
finish
a
solid
lager
beer
with
some
heft
good
light
body
lager
i
like
the
style
and
could
have
a
good
time
drinking
more
of
this
hazy
gold
pour
true
to
style
for
a
zwickel
or
kellerbier
listed
as
an
austrian
zwickel
on
the
menu
creamy
froth
and
rings
of
sticky
lace
nose
had
a
dry
bready
papery
sweetness
a
building
hop
bitterness
was
a
welcome
surprise
as
the
malt
flavor
was
light
and
the
body
was
similarly
light
and
easy
drinking
the
hop
character
was
a
little
bit
grassy
and
earthy
not
a
dominant
flavor
just
lent
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
it
was
a
refreshing
beer
and
i
would
have
had
another
despite
the
small
pour
a
hazy
lager
which
is
okay
in
zwickelkellerbier
light
orange
hue
not
that
pretty
not
much
head
retention
at
all
dirty
glass
but
a
good
earthy
minty
hoppy
smell
somewhat
minty
and
peppery
hops
mix
well
with
earthiness
which
im
guessing
is
contributed
by
the
yeast
a
very
quaffable
spicy
lager
with
some
earthy
notes
and
a
bit
of
a
yeast
bite
this
had
more
hop
character
than
i
expected
whatever
its
very
good
and
at
5
6
i
think
i
have
found
my
summer
session
beer
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
fun
and
tasty
to
try
the
beer
is
unimpressive
though
not
bad
but
for
the
price
it
isnt
something
id
buy
again
a
beer
that
would
benefit
with
a
lot
less
age
i
can
see
when
fresh
it
would
be
a
good
beer
with
over
a
year
on
it
its
well
past
its
prime
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
earthy
light
roasted
malt
aroma
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
herbal
hops
and
yeasty
tartness
medium
bodied
with
a
lightlyp
crisp
finish
light
roasted
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
earthy
grain
and
yeasty
notes
herbal
hop
flavors
from
the
middle
to
the
end
this
was
advertised
as
an
octoberfest
the
way
the
germans
meant
it
to
be
which
was
not
the
case
certainly
different
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
was
on
the
fence
when
i
purchased
it
but
im
glad
i
did
taste
was
much
more
complex
than
the
nose
rich
toasted
caramel
spice
tobacco
what
more
could
you
ask
for
o
so
this
is
hofstettens
attempt
at
recreating
the
beer
brewed
for
the
wedding
of
king
ludwig
i
the
first
oktoberfest
beer
im
really
digging
it
a
raw
very
yeasty
unfiltered
feststyle
beer
its
as
quaffable
as
they
come
really
enjoying
this
beer
though
it
doesnt
taste
like
other
kellerbiers
i
have
tried
if
you
dig
the
style
you
will
dig
this
too
o
this
beer
doesnt
break
any
new
ground
but
it
is
very
well
made
and
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
good
for
the
night
id
say
a
good
apple
pie
would
pair
well
here
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
solid
beer
of
the
style
very
clean
crisp
and
flavorful
i
dont
always
drink
beer
but
when
i
do
i
go
to
beer
advocate
stay
thirsty
my
acquaintances
had
this
on
tap
in
a
half
liter
marzen
glass
served
with
a
inch
of
off
white
head
that
fades
but
laces
overall
taste
is
malty
caramel
sweet
breadiness
with
smooth
earthy
hops
reminds
me
a
of
a
marzen
and
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
old
style
german
lagers
d
oddly
this
seems
more
like
an
english
winter
warmer
than
a
german
beer
even
so
it
is
quite
pleasant
if
not
overly
complex
and
it
is
certainly
drinkable
enough
o
great
balance
and
smooth
flavors
an
enjoyable
german
style
celebratory
beer
the
relative
richness
of
the
flavor
presents
an
intriguing
contrast
with
the
lightness
of
the
body
and
the
texture
of
the
beer
it
also
dries
out
significantly
in
the
finish
relative
to
the
sweetness
levels
of
the
midsip
this
brew
has
certainly
stoked
my
interest
in
sampling
more
kellers
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
medium
bodied
somewhat
delayed
moderate
carbonation
at
first
it
feels
smooth
and
then
becomes
a
little
prickly
this
is
a
nice
one
i
would
certainly
get
it
again
and
i
imagine
that
it
would
go
very
nicely
with
some
pumpkin
pastrycake
of
some
variety
not
your
average
octoberfest
but
very
drinkable
regardless
the
smell
is
almost
of
an
auld
ale
nature
with
hints
of
smokiness
yet
the
taste
is
very
different
easy
to
drink

would
gladly
have
again
not
a
bad
dunkles
kellerbier
o
a
pretty
good
beer
ive
not
had
many
representations
of
the
style
but
this
is
clean
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
classic
octoberfest
the
only
thing
that
could
make
this
beer
better
is
to
be
drinking
it
in
germany
overall
i
liked
this
one
i
hadnt
seen
if
available
before
but
i
will
be
going
back
for
another
one
soon
to
try
it
again
overall
not
that
great
but
certainly
not
horrible
other
kellers
were
more
interesting
to
me
but
i
could
have
this
again
no
problem
d
wonderful
collection
of
flavors
in
this
beer
and
the
fact
that
it
is
unfiltered
is
a
nice
touch
ive
been
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
for
a
while
and
this
it
a
great
addition
to
their
lineup
its
a
little
cost
prohibitive
to
be
your
sole
beer
for
an
oktoberfest
session
of
drinking
but
its
a
great
place
to
start
the
only
thing
i
would
personally
change
would
be
a
slightly
crisper
finish
still
its
hard
to
blend
complexity
and
drinkability
and
i
feel
this
beer
has
done
it
better
than
an
other
oktoberfest
ive
had
this
year
while
nothing
spectacular
i
suppose
this
was
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
an
interesting
beer
deep
amber
pour
with
a
thick
white
head
a
little
bit
hazy
good
looking
beer
the
nose
is
a
little
bit
herbal
and
woody
with
a
bit
of
light
hoppy
spiciness
there
is
a
decent
bit
of
breadycrusty
maltiness
on
the
back
of
a
nice
fresh
continental
malt
flavour
there
is
a
massive
distracting
metallic
flavour
on
the
back
that
is
brutal
it
completely
ruins
the
impression
i
had
it
would
have
been
pretty
nice
without
it
but
with
it
there
its
tough
to
take
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
but
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
night
d
i
love
kellerbiers
because
i
know
im
always
going
to
get
an
interesting
brew
this
is
another
one
of
them
this
was
in
a
wooden
cask
that
was
tapped
at
the
bier
gardens
oktoberfest
celebration
a
dark
auburn
brown
body
with
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
little
lace
patches
has
a
bitter
hop
smell
as
well
as
some
oakiness
natch
and
a
touch
of
spicy
citric
notes
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
thanks
to
sitting
in
that
cask
but
still
has
a
sharp
twinge
from
carbonation
the
malt
base
is
sturdy
and
gives
off
breadiness
and
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
the
hops
are
dominant
and
there
is
a
citric
spicy
taste
that
is
crisp
that
dominates
the
beer
was
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
now
this
an
odd
beerit
is
a
zwickelkeller
beer
for
sure
but
it
also
has
some
fest
beer
qualities
to
itmaking
for
an
interesting
hybrid
in
my
mind
poured
into
a
half
liter
stein
a
hazed
copper
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
crown
atop
that
left
broken
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
toasty
with
caramel
and
anise
spice
in
the
nosenot
much
presence
but
the
malt
qualities
are
distinct
and
nice
quite
dry
and
toasty
at
first
on
the
palate
with
some
of
that
central
european
ironlike
qualitythen
some
honey
and
caramel
malt
creeps
in
the
finish
i
like
this
beer
but
i
cant
define
ita
hazed
marzenfest
beer
maybe
drinkability
is
just
average
i
could
probably
slam
a
few
on
a
hot
day
but
would
they
be
worth
it
probably
not
not
bad
but
its
obviously
not
a
great
example
passable
at
best
d
my
first
beer
of
this
style
that
im
aware
of
i
really
enjoyed
it
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
something
i
could
have
two
to
three
of
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
my
first
of
the
style
was
highly
reminiscent
of
a
pilsner
but
a
heartier
malt
backbone
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
nice
milder
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
while
o
so
bavarian
this
one
is
fresher
and
considerably
better
than
the
first
one
i
had
before
given
smoother
mineraloxidation
notes
it
seems
it
degrades
rapidly
reference
for
the
style
one
that
does
not
swipe
me
off
my
feet
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
o
any
beer
in
this
style
is
welcomed
by
me
this
is
more
sour
than
any
kellerbier
ive
had
found
it
at

would
be

able
as
it

of
the

of
the

i
would

again
my

let
me
down
i
was
thinking
this
would
be
a
staple
and
reference
point
for
the
style
given
its
origins
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
lackluster
example
in
terms
of
flavor
complexity
and
feel
when
comparing
to
other
interpretations
of
the
style
ive
had
in
the
past
if
i
ever
got
the
opportunity
id
be
more
than
willing
to
try
this
fresh
to
see
how
it

if

i
will
be
a
regular
consumer
of
it
all
lager
fans
should
consider
this
one
a
must

it
combines
the
easydrinking

nature
of

lager
with
the
smooth

this

it
feels

something
of

challenge
to
drink
im
afraid
mthis
one
is
refreshing
and
start
neutral
changing
slowly
and
showing
some
bitterness
in
its
character
for
a
lasting
chewing
ending
not

o
this
was
a
nice
change
from
all
of
the
stronger
darker
brews
ive
been
drinking
lately
though
i
think
that
also
means
i
was
struggling
a
bit
to
fully
appreciate
it
definitely
better
fresher
but
still
a
nice
smooth
balanced
lager
that
actually
tastes
authentic
overall
a
good
rendition
of
a
german
lager
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
kellerbier
is
an
interpretative
style
that
has
a
large
range
of
possibility
this
one
happens
to
be
rough
and
unapologetic
lots
of
wheatlike
smoothness
going
on
here
everything
is
too
restrained
and
clean
despite
the
natural
yeast
presence
finishes
with
a
clear
note
of
diacetyl
which
takes
away
from
drinkability
a
little
bit
good
but
far
from
great
very
refeshing
went
down
a
treat
i
will
happily
drink
this
again
in
the
future
hackerpschorr
kellerbier
is
probably
my
favourite
of
the
style
to
date
which
is
no
surprise
considering
that
all
of
this
brewerys
offerings
are
considered
benchmark
examples
of
their
respective
styles
and
are
each
stellar
beers
in
their
own
right
not
to
mention
the
style
is
extremely
rare
and
few
examples
exist
nonetheless
this
is
an
absolutely
idyllic
lager
nice
enough
to
drink
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
spaten
no
great
flavours
nor
amazing
complexity
but
still
a
beer
that
you
would
not
stop
drinking
once
you
have
tasted
it
notes
this
is
the
same
beer
as
hackerpschorr
anno
1417
i
think
they
just
changed
the
label
recently
to
include
münchner

underneath
which
it
still

it

outstanding
example
of
a
cellar
beer
get
involved
had
on
tap
in
hallstatt
austria
this
was
definitely
a
very
unique
beer
a
very
hazy
color
hits
you
right
away
with
a
3
finger
foam
head
very
carbonated
and
refreshing
taste
as
everyone
wrote
not
a
common
beer
and
it
struck
me
at
first
as
a
pilsner
but
i
was
wrong
very
florally
and
vibrant
smell
and
the
taste
was
the
same
nice
yeasty
taste
with
a
mild
amount
of
hops
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
this
one
but
something
i
may
need
to
bring
back
to
boston
great
find
if
i
could
go
back
to
austria
tomorrow
for
a
few
more
6packs
i
would
happy
to
find
this
on
tap
in
chicago
and
excited
to
drink
again
on
a
planned
trip
to
austria
this
fall
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
topped
with
a
thick
creamy
two

bright
white
head
superb
retention
and
thick
splotchy

light

notes
and
fresh

dough
on

blossoms
and
apple
and
pearskin
heavy
light
body
to
very
light
medium

silky

with
a
touch

this
is
one
darn
good
brew
and
my
favorite
zwickl
to
date
highly
recommended
o
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
o
hands
down
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
one
of
the
best
unfiltered
lagers
ive
had
to
date
refreshing
drinkable
and
flavourful
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
at
that
supermarket
in
austria
its
always
a
charming
session
when
rediscovering
old
world
recipes
and
enjoying
their
results
only
a
few
tastes
are
necessary
to
understand
the
give
and
take
that
recent
developments
have
caused
to
the
brewing
scene
though
i
appreciate
the
cleaner
crisper
flavors
and
textures
of
todays
well
made
lagers
its
easy
to
see
that
this
process
removes
some
of
the
rich
flavor
that
this
beer
exhibits
very
well
o
my
first
zwickel
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
light
and
refreshing
with
some
substance
to
back
it
up
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
austrian
brews
delicious
nice
on
a
summer
day
o
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
hopefully
i
get
to
have
this
one
again
i
was
pleasantly
surprisedpours
a
dark
straw
in
an
awesome
glass
with
an
impressively
steady
head
and
good
lacing
smells
kind
of
boringly
lagery
with
a
hint
of
skunk
but
what
can
you
expect
from
the
style
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
clean
bready
malts
light
citrusgrass
hops
some
apple
notes
from
the
yeast
lots
of
yeast
as
there
should
be
giving
it
a
good
creamygritty
mouthfeel
nice
zwickl
and
there
should
be
more
in
the
us
d
i
generally
enjoyed
knocking
back
a
liter
and
a
half
so
i
guess
its
not
too
hard
to
get
down
it
has
a
dry
finish
that
makes
you
drink
quickly
overall
i
really
dig
this
brew
its
interesting
refreshing
highly
drinkable
if
youre
a
fan
of
hefeweizens
and
more
complex
lagers
than
check
this
zwickl
out
a
beautiful
zwickl
with
a
lot
of
elegant
flavours
this
is
quite
the
beer
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
stiegl
so
far
shame
its
not
frequently
distributed
to
the
us
i
said
it
before
ill
say
it
again
i
could
drink
this
all
day
it
was
a
dark
gold
color
very
cloudy
the
taste
was
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
though
balanced
and
refreshing
with
a
big
mouth
feel
on
the
richer
side
of
a
good
sessionable
beer
very
happy
that
i
tried
it
mellow
slightly
murky
flavor
with
decent
maltiness
rather
tart
hint
of
wheat
beer
flavors
and
a
grainy
sweetness
hops
are
restrained
but
reasonably
balanced
an
unassuming
modest
kind
of
beer
but
very
satisfying
good
mouthfeel
not
rich
but
robust
body
is
creamy
as
hell
almost
to
german
hefe
levels
smooth
from
the
high
quantities
of
unfiltered
yeast
giving
it
a
pretty
full
mouthfeel
for
a
lager
sessionworthy
for
sure
the
bigger
body
doesnt
hinder
it
at
all
get
it
while
you
can
this
will
only
be
around
for
the
season
d
cant
stand
it
get
this
feeling
in
my
mouth
afterwards
like
ive
been
drinking
hydrogen
peroxide
couldnt
drink
much
of
it
at
all
my
first
exposure
to
this
style
but
if
this
is
what
theyre
like
it
may
well
be
my
last
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
ones
out
there
not
my
style
of
choice
but
if
i
wanted
a
balanced
good
tasting
session
lager
id
go
for
this
a
session
beer
that
draws
some
flavor
similarities
to
lighter
and
less
famous
hefes
d
pleasantly
surprised
after
i
read
the
basics
of
the
zwickl
style
i
was
somewhat
tentative
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
overly
hopped
grassy
german
pilsners
but
this
is
nothing
like
those
styles
being
very
very
wellbalanced
and
complex
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
great
taste
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
away
a
six
pack
of
this
and
as
this
is
my
only
bottle
im
sad
to
see
it
go
i
sorta
want
some
more
a
relatively
hazy
orange
clear
beer
with
a
nice
white
head
quite
refresing
and
slightly
hoppy
well
balanced
and
slightly
grassy
the
aroma
is
plainly
sweet
and
malty
combined
with
some
notes
of
hops
the
flavor
is
dry
hoppy
combined
with
notes
of
caramel
the
body
is
thin
little
head
and
otherwise
behaved
like
a
cloudy
pale
lager
it
may
have
been
30
degrees
outside
and
thanksgiving
plans
are
in
the
air
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
immensely
and
quickly
maybe
sneaking
in
happy
thoughts
of
sunshine
and
bbq
grills
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
could
easily
be
my
goto
lager
i
imagine
if
i
tried
a
fresher
bottle
or
straight
from
the
tap
the
aroma
situation
would
be
significantly
better
rather
bitter
aftertaste
after
some
sipping
yeasty
flavors
further
down
the
bottle
definitely
unfiltered
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
malt
vine
in
redmond
washington
taste
clean
crisp
and
bold
quite
hoppy
for
this
fairly
light
beer
hop
flavor
is
saazlike
tinny
with
some
pear
and
apricot
fruity
works
great
with
the
sharp
spicy
zip
in
the
hop
bitter
similar
to
the
zip
in
a
bohemian
pils
crisp
sharp
fine
carbonation
complements
with
the
flavors
and
zip
finishes
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweet
nice
beer
but
is
this
style
supposed
to
be
just
a
bohemian
pils
thats
allowed
to
be
cloudy
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
citrus
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
very
solid
beer
it
doesnt
wow
me
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
only
area
in
which
lacks
is
aroma
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
a
lighter
style
the
body
was
smooth
and
even
with
a
nicely
dry
finish
drinkability
was
good
it
went
down
smooth
and
quick
and
ill
certainly
have
another
overall
a
very
nice
brew
one
thatll
be
a
choice
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
lighter
certainly
worth
a
shot
when
you
see
it
overall
this
beer
is
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
amber
thin
fine
white
head
leaves
a
long
lasting
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
and
wispy
lacing
aroma
is
bready
malt
simple
stright
forward
lager
flavor
is
bisquity
and
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
yeast
with
a
pleasant
hop
kick
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
excellent
for
a
low
abv
lager
deceptively
simple
the
flavor
is
complex
enough
to
keep
my
interest
throughout
the
bottle
an
enjoyable
lager
the
unfiltered
process
definitely
adds
more
flavor
and
body
to
this
beer
i
wil
buy
this
again
love
the
color
on
this
thing
dark
for
a
lager
a
tad
bit
hazy
and
not
much
head
the
smell
is
the
weakest
part
for
me
some
soursweet
thing
going
on
for
the
nose
the
sweet
aspect
smells
cheap
to
me
kind
of
a
cough
drop
thing
goin
on
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
honey
bit
of
grass
pear
and
green
tea
ends
crisp
too
bad
these
arent
in
sixers
theyd
make
a
good
summer
session
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
will
enjoy
if
summer
ever
joins
us
here
in
the
northwest
o
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
ample
offwhite
head
lacing
lingers
in
a
thick
cap
smell
is
slight
sulfur
orange
mango
slight
sweetness
reminiscent
of
an
apa
taste
is
biscut
bready
malt
and
a
yeast
kick
slight
citrus
with
a
slight
hop
bite
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
the
lager
yeast
makes
what
would
be
a
mild
apa
a
great
sessionable
lager
carbonation
is
medium
high
and
prickly
clean
smooth
body
a
hair
thicker
than
normal
lagers
piney
after
taste
lingers
well
with
the
biscut
flavors
very
drinkable
indeed
