from
the
bottle
its
a
hazy
golden
pour
good
head
and
an
inviting
smell
ive
been
going
back
to
le
merle
for
a
good
while
citrus
notes
and
subtle
frisky
hops
yum
yum
its
tastes
like
late
summer
at
the
ballpark
overall
an
interesting
twist
to
the
saison
style
from
north
coast
the
orange
peel
definitely
takes
charge
and
the
the
traditional
saison
elements
act
as
a
supporting
cast
complex
and
delightful
with
a
pleasant
bit
of
strength
from
abv
tropical
and
herbal
juice
with
a
fantastic
peppery
crisp
carb
best
tasting
saison
ive
ever
tried
fruity
yeasty
a
little
too
pungent
for
my
tastes
but
for
the
style
it
is
very
enjoyable
hazy
orange
body
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
aromas
include
stone
fruits
yeast
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
apple
pear
melon
belgian
yeast
strain
moderate
sweetness
more
akin
to
a
tripel
than
a
saison
decent
but
one
pour
is
plenty
sweet
alcohol
limited
drinkability
i
always
have
trouble
with
analyzing
saisons
but
this
one
is
pretty
simple
very
mild
malt
and
hoppiness
with
a
decent
carbonation
burn
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
very
little
aftertaste
quite
refreshing
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
saison
its
part
of
a
4
pack
so
im
cellaring
the
rest
to
see
what
changes
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
hope
to
be
able
to
find
it
locally
solid
orange
fairly
hazy
with
an
expansive
puffy
head
that
deflates
to
a
lumpy
froth
smell
is
yeasty
peppery
oranges
dried
flowers
spicy
phenolics
and
crackers
peppercorns
apple
lemon
honey
coriander
bubblegum
and
a
powdery
sort
of
sweetness
fluffy
bodied
crisp
and
just
a
little
tart
not
bad
but
not
quite
coming
together
for
me
nice
dry
semibitter
taste
feel
it
after
a
few
sips
too
overall
3
98
ive
only
had
two
other
flanders
style
ales
and
this
one
takes
the
cake
for
character
and
flavor
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
its
only
a
7
0
abv
because
that
alcohol
taste
really
kicks
hard
at
the
end
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
two
and
not
only
one
but
if
i
had
picked
up
three
i
may
have
regretted
it
okay
in
small
doses
overallthis
was
okay
impression
left
was
of
a
somewhat
harsh
belgian
saison
as
far
as
the
peppercorn
aspect
which
is
a
less
desirable
departure
from
the
more
refreshing
balance
ive
experienced
in
such
styles
heres
a
possible
drink
to
wash
down
dinner
its
not
cheap
4
99
for
this
375
ml
bottle
so
pick
a
good
occasion
to
celebrate
with
this
liquid
amber
colored
with
a
lot
of
haze
and
a
thin
layer
of
white
foam
on
top
the
head
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
leaves
no
lacing
behind
fruity
aroma
mainly
consisting
of
apple
very
sweet
and
not
as
dry
as
i
prefer
saison
to
be
overall
this
just
wasnt
very
good
it
was
missing
the
funk
and
spice
that
i
love
about
the
style
o
a
more
fruity
version
of
a
saison
less
dry
than
a
bunch
i
have
had
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
those
as
the
style
is
sometimes
just
a
bit
earthy
and
dry
for
my
tastes
o
3
75
enjoyable
but
not
something
id
get
again
tried
about
3
years
ago
and
realized
i
did
not
do
a
review
a
golden
hazy
bubbly
saison
with
tons
of
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
leaving
the
glass
my
first
saison
and
i
was
so
intrigued
by
le
merle
that
i
named
my
dog
after
it
truly
a
great
saison
for
warm
cold
or
whatever
weather
time
of
the
year
o
refreshing
surprisingly
light
on
its
feet
and
with
good
balance
fits
the
style
well
enjoyable
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
decent
is
about
the
best
i
can
offer
for
a
review
eric
cheers
all
a
solid
beer
more
like
a
bspa
brewed
with
saison
yeast
in
my
book
one
of
the
best
saisons
i
have
had
made
by
a
us
brewery
north
coast
makes
some
good
stuff
aroma
of
light
sour
lemons
taste
of
belgium
yeast
quite
nice
refreshing
would
seak
out
again
i
really
like
old
rasputin
as
well
nice
to
drink
local
beers
from
california
fresh
and
delish
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
pours
with
excellent
clarity
from
tap
to
snifter
the
aroma
has
citrus
as
well
as
peach
or
pear
juice
nice
fruity
nose
the
taste
is
earthier
but
still
has
a
fruitiness
grassy
milky
citrusy
hop
character
works
with
the
fruit
and
damp
hay
notes
fair
bitterness
the
brew
finishes
clean
and
balanced
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
saison
for
an
american
version
12
oz
bottle
from
lifesource
in
salem

pours
a
slightly
hazyfine
carbonated
golden
colour
large
rocky
white

fine
summer
fruit
aromas
nectarine
papaya
some
apricot
a
little
barnyard
hay
in
the
back
nice
taste
is
the
same
but
a
little
more
spicypeppery
and
floral
nice
mouth
feel
very
fine
carbonation
long
lasting
after
taste
from
the
hops
i
assume
a
fine
beer
for
a
warm
humid
spring
night
pours
from
the
bottle
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
a
heady
aroma
of
yeast
barnyard
funk
spices
and
fruit
those
are
all
present
in
the
taste
but
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
present
as
well
the
fruit
banana
apple
grape
some
citrus
really
comes
through
with
great
balance
medium
mouth
but
a
little
chewy
still
the
carbonation
gives
this
beer
the
crispness
you
expect
from
a
saison
la
merle
will
definitely
be
added
to
my
list
of
favorite
farmhouse
ales
overall
a
really
good
american
take
on
a
belgian
saison
very
good
mix
of
yeast
spice
and
fruit
flavors
o
great
stuff
its
a
very
brawny
and
muscular
saison
not
as
light
and
drinkable
as
most
in
the
style
tend
to
be
these
days
but
its
very
complex
and
bold
i
would
recommend
this
for
people
who
like
hard
ciders
traditional
hefes
or
who
want
a
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
remarkably
high
alcohol
content
relative
to
the
body
and
drinkability
its
not
my
favorite
saison
ever
but
its
very
good
and
id
definitely
grab
a
bottle
if
i
saw
it
available
again
i
wish
i
liked
this
beer
but
ill
pass
on
it
the
next
time
i
see
this
in
the
store
i
want
to
finish
by
saying
that
i
am
in
nj
and
this
is
a
west
coast
brewery
i
think
this
beer
suffered
from
being
corked
as
it
was
pretty
swollen
and
tough
to
get
out
o
huge
fan
of
the
north
coast
brewery
and
finding
this
was
a
real
treat
did
not
disappoint
very
good
quality
and
a
nice
rendering
of
the
saison
style
only
complaint
would
be
the
amount
of
the
sweetness
just
a
little
too
much
overall
the
warm
weather
is
headed
to
boston
so
happy
to
be
enjoying
this
beer
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
many
more
if
these
as
the
weather
gets
better
overall
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
saison
which
i
can
see
myself
drinking
in
the
summer
peppery
grassy
and
nicely
tart
worth
a
try
at
least
once
overall
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
tasted
in
a
while
well
balanced
fruity
spicy
not
too
carbonated
and
well
balanced
this
is
in
many
ways
a
model
saison
its
on
the
strong
side
but
with
enough
flavor
to
drink
well
it
also
doesnt
have
that
overdose
of
yeasty
craziness
that
i
find
too
often
in
clumsier
examples
also
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
a
brewery
that
does
not
do
much
for
me
otherwise
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on

pours
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
12
finger
dense
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
spotty
foamy
lacing
clings
on

only
a

overall
this
is

all
around
awesome

and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
the
touch
of
honey
flavor
really
pulls
everything
together
and
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
o
a
really
nice
saison
on
the
fruity
side
of
the
style
overall
i
will
but
this
again
very
good
and
reasonably
priced
i
would
say
this
beer
is
not
unlike
duvel
costs
less
and
is
made
in
america
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
good
kick
not
too
filling
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
choices
within
the
style
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
although
it
is
let
down
by
the
residual
sweetness
recommended
oh
damn
that
is
one
easy
sip
super
complex
feel
and
flavor
with
huge
sour
fruits
dry
earthiness
with
wheat
zippy
light
and
smooth
did
i
mention
how
complex
it
is
seems
to
evaporate
with
a
dry
bite
right
before
the
finish
clean
clean
like
sparkling
water
the
yeast
is
just
delightful
this
one
gives
just
about
any
belgianfrench
saison
a
run
for
its
money
in
all
aspects
i
think
im
in
love
overall
a
tasty
saison
a
bit
sweet
slightly
out
of
style
but
worth
a
try
if
im
going
to
go
for
a
domestically
made
affordable
saison
i
think
id
stick
with
ommegangs
hennepin
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
simply
put
this
lacks
the
funky
rustic
character
than
would
classify
anything
as
a
saison
in
order
to
distinguish
it
from
a
strong
belgian
blonde
ale
which
this
far
more
resembles
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
its
still
a
well
made
beer
its
just
very
mild
and
way
too
high
in
alcohol
for
it
to
merit
practical
consumption
north
coast
definitely
has
better
belgian
style
offerings
this
one
at
least
could
be
a
good
introduction
to
someone
starting
to
get
into
these
types
of
beers
this
is
my
true
for
saison
and
it
is
delicious
beer
i
must
say
anyways
theres
no
more
of
you
your
parents
is
looks
like
a
normal
amber
but
without
clear
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
reminds
me
of
fruits
maybe
even
a
slight
acidic
taste
and
then
finally
the
taste
delicious
farmhouse
funk
in
the
beginning
which
melos
to
tropical
and
normal
fruits
the
mouth
feels
were
really
stands
out
here
at
last
with
you
for
several
minutes
why
you
can
still
enjoy
the
flavors
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
maybe
not
a
daily
drinker
though
due
to
the
complexity
overall
mixed
on
this
one
i
dont
remember
it
being
nearly
as
sweet
as
this
and
also
more
funky
a
lot
more
farmhouse
on
the
samples
we
had
probably
another
batch
but
this
was
still
pretty
decent
but
hard
to
drink
the
whole
750ml
by
myself
beautifully
presented
in
a
corked
bottle
with
the
champagne
like
wire
trap
over
the
top
a
nice
offering
from
the
brewmasters
at
north
coast
overal
a
beer
i
keep
going
back
to
especially
in
the
summer
months
it
has
complex
flavor
that
can
repeatedly
be
enjoyed
highly
recommended
for
a
refreshing
beer
before
or
during
dinner
overall
not
bad
but
a
bit
bland
overall
more
like
a
just
ok
belgian
tripel
and
along
those
lines
it
is
a
little
onedimensional
its
not
terrible
but
its
barely
above
average
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
am
enjoying
what
i
have
in
front
of
me
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
great
saison
definitely
worth
trying
overall
not
a
bad
saison
i
will
visit
this
again
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
lovely
beer
worth
looking
into
overall
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
although
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
as
unique
nonetheless
it
is
one
that
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
cheaper
overall
a
flavoursome
saison
many
underlying
flavours
in
the
base
beer
not
as
easy
drinking
as
some
is
that
a
good
or
a
bad
thing
o
sure
go
ahead
grab
a
few
overall
this
is
as
light
of
a
belgian
ill
ever
enjoy
and
would
consider
this
to
be
the
real
champagne
of
beer
o
excellently
balanced
with
a
good
finish
makes
me
excited
for
summer
le
merle
is
absolutely
my
favorite
beer
and
my
home
is
never
without
a
bottle
o
delightful
beer
in
a
style
im
growing
to
appreciate
more
and
more
ahhh
as
a
saison
well
im
partial
to
this
style
this
one
is
very
nice
not
too
sweet
or
spicy
or
funky
but
full
bodied
and
very
tasty
at
7
9
abv
its
higher
than
traditional
farm
worker
saisons
by
a
long
shot
but
thats
fine
for
todays
after
work
lets
have
a
few
tasty
gems
lifestyle
ayieee
d
needs
some
serious
work
too
simple
run
of
the
mill
saison
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
c
o
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
but
note
found
it
closer
to
a
traditional
belgian
blonde
than
saison
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
north
coast
o
a
great
saison
would
drink
again
one
of
my
new
favorites
o
very
solid
above
average
saison
great
to
drink
during
the
day
while
doing
an
activity
o
a
very
solid
saison
for
the
price
not
very
complex
but
its
simplicity
works
o
highly
recommended
would
have
again
and
again
very
drinkable
very
pleasant
very
spicy
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
out
there
doesnt
get
a
lot
of
hype
for
a
few
reasons
its
not
old
rasputin
most
of
north
coasts
other
stuff
is
just
mediocre
and
its
readily
available
a
superbly
balanced
and
complex
beer
all
factors
meld
well
and
compliment
each
other
making
for
a
delicious
late
summer
or
in
the
case
early
fall
adult
beverage
not
too
sweet
not
too
tart
alcohol
doesnt
dominate
anything
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
outstanding
saison
here
this
is
easily
my
favorite
north
coast
beer
to
date
it
pours
a
pale
goldenrod
color
cloudy
but
neat
looking
at
the
same
time
a
one
and
a
half
inch
head
rests
on
top
and
doesnt
go
away
the
nose
is
great
fresh
farmy
yeast
delivers
a
very
organic
feel
not
as
funky
as
some
saisons
but
refined
and
elegant
the
yeast
is
the
star
of
the
show
here
but
there
is
a
nice
wheaty
malt
base
and
some
gentle
fruit
flavors
golden
raison
tangerine
lemongrass
its
a
very
well
balanced
beer
completely
devoid
of
any
alcohol
presence
despite
being
nearly
8
abv
it
still
feels
like
a
felicate
brew
at
that
level
the
feel
is
great
excited
carbonation
gives
it
a
really
bright
mouthfeel
the
body
is
medium
and
really
satisfyingly
drinkable
at
less
than
6
bucks
a
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
my
money
has
bought
lately
a
great
late
summerearly
fall
saison
one
of
my
favorite
farmhouse
strong
summer
ales
that
i
have
ever
sampled
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
a
very
impressive
saison
id
pick
this
one
up
again
i
often
look
for
a
saison
that
is
steeped
with
black
pepper
and
herbal
spicinessweirdness
this
might
be
the
opposite
but
the
delivery
is
very
good
its
crisp
and
buttery
with
most
of
its
flavors
in
the
foreground
with
little
left
underneath
to
ponder
these
are
all
good
and
bad
things
depending
on
what
you
are
looking
for
but
it
fills
a
niche
that
i
havent
quite
seen
before
and
for
that
i
commend
it
overall
a
well
done
saison
and
one
im
glad
to
have
in
our
state
notes
moderate
to
medium
in
body
with
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
great
complex
flavor
and
balance
make
this
a
very
palatable
brew
for
the
money
le
merle
is
a
steal
as
it
rivals
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
the
beer
tastes
quite
strangely
bitter
with
a
very
harsh
cut
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
nice
light
fruity
flavor
to
this
beer
much
like
the
smell
with
spicy
hints
and
very
sour
feel
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
which
has
got
me
lips
puckering
slightly
this
is
far
more
of
a
sourale
than
any
other
saison
i
have
tried
reminding
me
more
and
more
of
a
lambic
ale
carbonation
and
harsh
bittersour
attacks
the
tongue
right
off
the
bat
and
hides
some
of
the
more
slight
spicy
flavors
that
seem
to
exist
as
ghosts
in
the
beer
the
beer
leaves
the
tip
of
the
tongue
tingling
with
harsh
bubbles
and
thus
mutes
a
lot
of
the
afterflavor
as
well
orange
and
slight
pineapple
are
still
present
in
the
flavoring
overall
i
feel
like
the
beer
sits
too
sweet
and
harsh
on
the
tongue
which
kills
other
flavors
complexity
and
doesnt
really
make
it
for
me
this
beer
has
an
awesome
bottle
and
pours
very
lovely
in
a
glass
but
its
taste
and
smell
dont
deliver
i
rank
this
a
meh
beer
with
an
awesome
bottle
i
really
like
the
bottle
if
you
havent
noticed
whoa
this
brew
totally
caught
me
offguard
as
it
sat
on
the
shelf
i
almost
passed
it
by
glad
i
didnt
highly
recommended
at
the
7
price
and
for
an
easy
summer
drinker
compares
well

across
with

theres
a

lots

is

flavor
is
a
light
bready
flavor
with
the
same
light
fermented

flavor
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
pours
a
clear

with
a
massive
frothy

suprisingly
no

at

the

lotsa
dark

plum

got
the

started
on

light
hops
and
peppery

average
mouthfeel
nothing
noteworthy
overall
i
thought
this
was
decent
love
the
brewery
but
this
just
wasnt
one
of
my
favs
from
them
1
for
the
bird
you
can
gaze
at
on
the
label
while
partaking
though
he
does
look
slightly
in
pain
pretty
typical
saison
tastes
almost
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
its
drinkable
but
one
dimensional
i
wouldnt
pay
the
price
tag
for
another
bomber
of
this
overall
a
pretty
tasty
saison
one
worth
re
sampling
for
sure
o
good
beer
but
i
like
funk
in
my
saisons
fine
representation
of
the
style
when
done
right
i
find
saisons
drinkable
but
never
overpowering
dry
refeshing
great
drink
to
have
on
a
warm
spring
evening
overall
very
winelike
fruit
flavors
dominate
sour
but
not
offensive
its
actually
pretty
darn
good
and
the
only
gripe
i
have
is
that
the
flowery
yeasty
character
i
look
for
in
a
saison
is
hidden
behind
the
acidic
fruit
flavors
actually
i
have
another
gripe
the
carbonation
is
really
too
excessive
and
kills
it
for
me
a
bit
id
consider
decanting
this
one
and
pouring
it
back
and
forth
between
glasses
to
take
the
edge
off
ill
probably
pick
it
up
again
sometime
to
pair
with
dinner
although
id
pass
if
i
was
just
looking
for
something
to
drink
while
relaxing
after
work
overall
pretty
good
this
has
a
nice
yeast
profile
but
gets
the
alcohol
level
a
bit
too
high
i
think
taking
this
down
to
66
5
would
lead
to
a
more
crisp
and
drinkable
beer
o
a
nicely
drinkable
saison
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
spices
yeast
and
some
light
fruity
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
but
there
is
also
a
slight
soapy
flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
nice
drinkable
saison
this
compares
favorably
to
my
homebrew
versions
but
lacks
the
complexity
seen
in
the
classic
style
reference
examples
like
dupont
nice
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
the
unadventurous
pour
was
a
little
uninspiring
with
its
lack

head
but
the
color
was
nice
just

more
saisons

give
them

only
drawback
to
this

the

this
was
my
first
farmhouse
ale
i
wasnt
overly
wowed
by
the
flavors
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
the
refreshing
ms
sofie
on
the
patio
during
a
summer
afternoon
cloudy
golden
coloring
smells
of
minerals

sweetness
it
is
very

noticeable
carbonation
and
some

i
liked
it
overall
very
good
easy
to
drink
a
bit
sour
with
strong
citrus
mainly
orange
flavors
but
mostly
mild
in
taste
i
look
forward
to
setting
up
a
vertical
as
i
have
heard
sofie
really
hits
its
stride
about
three
years
of
conditioning
this
stuff
is
sofie
king
good
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
really
didnt
care
for
it
now
i
can
cross
this
off
my
list
for
good
pours
a

gold
the
smell
of
pepper
is
apparent
right

spicy
at
first
but
finishes
with
a
smooth
and

flavor
feels
refreshing
and
an
overall
great
tasting
beer
rjt
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
were
going
out
to
a
friends
house
for
lunch
or
maybe
out
to
a
picnic
it
would
pair
excellently
with
chicken

sampled
on
8162014
when
bottle
was
6
months
old
this
is
a
great
introductory
beer
for
the
white
wine
drinker
i
loved
matilda
so
i
thought
that
by
all
the
great
reviews
that
id
love
sofie
since
i
love
me
some
belgian
style
beers
i
was
very
confused
by
this
beer
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
the
beer
looked
incredibly
light
looking
i
tasted
the
beer
and
it
tasted
incredibly
light
like
watered
down
and
thus
i
was
disappointed
i
bought
a
4
pack
so
ill
definitely
be
drinking
it
all
but
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
their
beer
called
matilda
on
the
other
hand
was
awesome
im
not
sure
if
they
encourage
aging
this
beer
but
thats
what
ill
be
doing
since
as
it
is
it
just
isnt
special
maybe
with
time
it
gets
better
idk
o
others
mention
the
wine
influence
but
i
dont
drink
wine
so
i
dont
pick
any
of
that
up
very
good
saison
looking
forward
to
the
other
3
bottles
from
this
4pack
too
much
like
a
chardonnay
for
my
taste
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
yeast
nor
the
compliment
it
provides
to
any
measure
of
citrus
character
faint
and
i
mean
very
faint
hints
of
vanilla
hit
the
very
back
end
of
the
tongue
it
looks
really
nice
in
the
glass
but
beyond
that
not
something
ill
be
seeking
out
again
sorry
for
the
one
night
stand
sofie
not
a
big
fan
this
beer
looked
better
then
it
tasted
was
told
it
was
a
sour
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
its
a
wheat
beer
a
slightly
complicated
beer
but
worth
trying
favorite
beer
by
far
as
is
1162015
cant
find
it
yet
here
in
maine
but
i
know
a
few
distributors
that
can
order
it
for
me
crisp
and
clean
but
still
watered
down
taste
as
a
dark
beer
fan
i
didnt
know
how
i
would
feel
about
this
but
it
really
did
deliver
right
off
the
bat
you
get
the
citrus
aroma
and
the
beautiful
bubbly
head
on
first
taste
you
immediately
detect
the
wine
notes
which
are
beautifully
balanced
in
the
mix
i
really
loved
this
beer
and
i
dont
love
a
lot
of
lighter
beers
the
chardonnay
influence
is
undeniable
both
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
these
particle
characteristics
the
wood
aspect
and
the
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
become
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
up
from
fridge
temperature
i
did
not
experience
the
visible
carbonation
levels
that
have
been
reported
in
other
reviews
saison
yeast
aromas
up
front
you
get
the
grassiness
and
some
lemon
scent
along
with
a
hint
of
white
pepper
that
i
found
appealing
somewhat
hard
to
nail
down
exactly
what
is
going
on
with
this
beer
but
its
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
a
good
beer
i
am
usually
a
fan
of
darker
beers
but
still
enjoyed
the
sofie
i
enjoyed
he
citrus
notes
and
the
zest
and
the
hint
of
chardonnay
a
very
interesting
and
balanced
beer
a
little
more
carbonation
and
some
fresh
character
herbs
or
more
late
addition
hops
could
make
it
world
class
but
as
it
stands
its
a
good
american
attempt
at
a
saison
great
everyday
option
at
alot
of
high
end
places
that
done
carry
the
best
beer
o
if
enjoy
saisons
with
a
little
funk
this
is
really
good
a
very
unique
beer
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
overall
solid
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
i
definitely
prefer
matilda
over
this
i
was
hoping
for
a
big
vinous
tart
and
bitter
beer
but
this
was
mostly
just
like
a
tripel
with
light
funk
maybe
it
needs
moreless
time
overall
never
was
a
fan
of
sour
beers
and
something
into
this
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
level
however
as
the
beer
leaves
cold
temperature
and
enters
room
temperature
it
does
reveal
some
more
flavors
of
orange
and
woodgrains
not
my
favorite
brew
i
would
stick
with
hennepin
by
ommegang
or
saisonbrett
by

i
may
recommend
to
a
few
friends
but
i
definitely
wont
be
trying
again
cheers
overall
it
almost
has
a
fake
or
manufactured
flavor
to
it

it

comes

so
i
can
understand
why
also
know
that
this
is

my
personal

ale
so
different
from
other
belgian
styles
nice
work
golden
clear
and
sparkling
whitish
haze
of
head
with
tiny
bubbles
delicate
aromas
with
hints
of
spicefunk
delicious
pineapple
and
citrus
and
some
mild
breadiness
clean
pineapple
notes
in
the
taste
funk
city
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
smooth
almost
like
a
bubbly
white
wine
nice
funky
aftertaste
havent
been
disappointed
by
a
gi
lady
yet
overall
i
can
see
how
others
would
see
this
as
being
a
delectable
masterpiece
of
a
beer
theres
no
denying
that
its
a
delicious
and
lovely
concoction
im
personally
not
planning
on
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
however
because
i
like
my
beer
to
taste
like
beer
dont
get
me
wrongim
more
than
aware
of
the
incredibly
wide
variety
of
flavors
beer
can
produce
this
brew
however
felt
like
it
was
wearing
too
good
of
a
champagne
costume
i
missed
my
old
friend
o
4
5
still
a
winner
i
first
had
this
in
chicago
about
6
years
ago
its
still
just
as
good
despite
their
big
expansion
765
ml
large
format
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
slightly
cloudy
lemon
yellow
brew
with
a
gorgeous
creamy
white
head
that
retains
form
well
some
fizzy
effervescence
and
yeast
debris
floating
around
pretty
beer
wonderful
nose
too
shockingly
tropical
and
vinous
loads
of
pineapple
white
grape
pear
lemon
yellow
grapefruit
juicy
fruit
gum
unripe
gooseberry
and
dry
moderately
funky
horse
blanket
just
a
hint
of
fresh
bread
certainly
a
unique
farmhouse
ale
on
nose
and
palate
very
quenching
dry
and
sour
but
with
enough
pear
and
tropical
fruit
to
provide
some
balance
and
keep
this
firmly
anchored
outside
of
orval
territory
although
one
is
tempted
to
draw
a
few
comparisons
fresh
pear
and
pineapple
galore
with
echoes
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
nice
easygoing
but
still
assertive
brettanomyces
creates
an
earthy
dry
vibe
that
runs
parallel
to
the
fruit
element
the
sour
note
does
develop
as
one
sips
body
on
the
light
side
fairly
high
carbonation
finishes
citric
mildly
floral
and
bonedry
any
malt
flavor
is
largely
buried
but
if
you
appreciate
sours
or
belgian
beers
more
generally
there
is
much
to
like
here
i
am
appreciating
the
meld
of
sweet
fruit
sour
fruit
and
dry
belgian
funk
with
no
one
component
running
the
show
overall
extremely
clean
and
very
wellbalanced
after
drinking
my
first
glass
i
read
the
back
and
discovered
that
20
of
this
blend
is
aged
in
white
wine
barrels
which
explains
the
beautiful
white
wine
and
pear
notes
mentioned
earlier
what
a
great
beer
very
impressive
this
stands
out
in
an
oversaturated
market
of
american
craft
beer
no
doubt
about
it
i
am
rating
this
extra
high
for
its
precision
and
creative
approach
pale
yellowstraw
colour
pour
with
foamy
head
can
definitely
taste
the
wine
but
its
just
the
right
amount
citrus
orange
slight
hints
of
vanilla
excellent
carbonation
almost
sparkling
very
very
nice
beer
orange
apple
lemon
pear
flavors
crisp
dry
tasty
stuff
crisp
clean
flavor
with
light
citrus
background
fine
carbonation
with
a
nice
light
head
overall
an
excellent
saison
from
goose
island
for
my
first
offering
from
these
guys
this
saison
is
pleasantly
light
and
citrusy
all
the
elements
of
the
style
blend
cohesively
and
the
notes
of
white
wine
add
a
nice
complexity
to
this
well
executed
brew
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
one
of
the
better
belgian
style
beers
i
have
had
as
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
spices
without
any
one
taking
over
the
show
easy
to
drink
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bite
at
the
end
lead
by
coriander
but
not
overtaken
by
it
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
1
5
finger
head
on
the
pour
the
head
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
but
bubblies
continue
from
the
bottom
throughout
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
would
revisit
this
beer
lightbodied
and
bubbly
this
is
an
interesting
brew
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
sourfunky
a
white
alesaison
mix
with
a
champagnelike
character
to
it
for
a
typically
understated
style
this
possesses
a
whole
lot
of
extra
goodness
all
of
which
does
nothing
to
push
things
over
the
top
instead
everything
stays
right
on
track
even
the
elevated
13proof
booze
a
crazily
saucy
and
intricate
saison
packaging
included
from
one
of
the
last
parts
of
the
world
one
might
expect
transnational
corporation
ownership
aside
good
beer
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
this
is
one
of
various
beers
by
goose
island
that
seems
to
have
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
still
a
solid
beer
but
current
releases
are
lacking
the
balance
that
i
remember
from
previous
years
compared
to
tank
7
or
saisonbrett
by
boulevard
or
the
impressive
examples
from
crooked
stave
in
denver
this
falls
short
of
the
mark
still
a
widely
available
and
accessible
saison
and
a
good
introduction
for
those
unfamiliar
with
the
style
price
point
7
9922
oz
bottle
o
so
good
and
so
worth
it
complex
as
hell
and
very
delicate
if
thats
the
word
im
looking
for
sip
this
one
and
enjoy
it
overall
delicious
goose
island
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
really
enjoyed
it
great
for
small
parties
the
bottle
itself
is
pretty
elegant
and
once
you
pour
it
in
its
great
high
on
citris
flavors
but
smooth
going
down
a
great
cloudy
yet
crisp
looking
amber
and
goes
down
smooth
perfect
for
a
summer
day
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
but
if
your
looking
to
indulge
go
for
it
overall
stellar
beer
enjoyed
a
lot
over
the
years
and
many
more
times
in
the
future
this
is
quite
enjoyable
but
the
vinegar
flavors
are
not
well
suited
to
my
palate
and
make
me
score
this
lower
d
drinking
fairly
nice
fresh
but
i
am
sure
the
brett
will
get
much
better
with
some
age
probably
not
a
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
nice
and
refreshing
would
definitely
like
to
check
out
some
vintages
one
day
o
reminds
me
a
little
bit
last
years
batch
of
apfelwein
i
made
except
this
is
beer
and
doesnt
have
any
apples
i
can
see
someone
who
isnt
big
on
heavy
beers
liking
this
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
but
i
cant
pick
out
any
one
feature
of
it
that
makes
me
want
to
go
back
for
another
bottle
its
not
bad
and
it
could
be
good
to
introduce
a
bmc
drinker
to
craft
beer
but
at
5
99
a
bomber
i
probably
wont
have
another
prost
o
complex
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavour
however
all
of
the
elements
come
together
to
an
incredibly
harmonious
finish
this
saison
can
be
enjoyed
either
by
appreciating
each
layer
individually
or
simply
enjoying
the
complete
package
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
dont
recall
enjoying
this
beer
so
much
in
the
past
the
stand
out
note
for
me
was
the
brett
and
its
cheesy
ripe
barnyard
notes
as
it
warms
the
orange
peel
does
come
out
a
bit
more
and
the
yeast
becomes
more
zesty
and
peppery
the
wine
barrel
is
not
super
prominent
but
then
again
its
only
a
20
blend
overall
given
the
availability
of
this
id
recommended
it
when
in
need
of
a
modestly
priced
brettfruit
forward
saison
dont
usually
fancy
this
type
of
offering
more
of
a
stout
guy
however
this
nails
it
great
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
light
and
crisp
i
would
pair
this
with
chicken
or
fish
was
surprised
by
the
fruitycitrus
kick
it
has
a
pleasant
surprise
well
done
gi
12
49
for
4
pk
overall
its
a
great
americanmade
sasion
its
not
very
expensive
go
get
some
o
weve
got
a
winner
here
lots
of
good
things
going
on
in
every
category
overall
very
well
done
farmhouse
ale
one
of
those
beers
that
id
want
to
try
at
different
ages
hard
to
believe
only
a
15th
of
the
liquid
sent
time
in
a
barrel
plenty
going
on
and
i
like
all
of
it
overall
very
enjoyable
and
great
in
the
summer
some
age
on
this
could
do
wonders
o
a
solid
american
brewers
take
on
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
a
pretty
regular
staple
for
me
this
belgian
saison
pours
a
hazy
orange
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
lasts
throughout
the
pour
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
funky
refreshing
blend
of
apricots
belgian
yeast
lemon
peel
and
wine
reminded
me
of
pinot
grigio
the
mouthfeel
is
light
refreshing
and
effervescent
perfect
for
the
style
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
and
reminds
me
much
more
of
a
carbonated
white
wine
than
an
ale
this
was
very
good
i
want
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
now
to
see
the
difference
poured
from
a
corked
765
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
op
not
expecting
much
pleasantly
surprised
almost
to
good
to
be
true
a
great
price
point
for
great
beer
hopefully
their
marketing
campaign
doesnt
involve
selling
beer
at
such
a
low
price
until
it
catches
on
im
totally
ok
with
paying
8
99
at
the
whole
foods
grocer
for
this
in
fact
im
going
to
grab
a
couple
more
of
these
before
they
run
out
o
a
very
nicely
done
saison
with
subtle
flavors
complementary
to
the
style
taste
spicy
citrus
and
somewhat
sweet
flavors
all
compliment
each
other
just
right
so
one
is
not
overpowering
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
at
least
more
fruit
dominant
than
barnyard
this
beer
has
held
up
very
well
over
4
years
an
excellent
beer
the
white
wine
barrel
character
is
beautifully
balanced
in
this
beer
and
adds
a
lot
very
nice
overall
i
think
this
is
a
beer
some
people
may
like
but
its
not
perfect
its
kind
of
light
on
the
taste
and
has
an
effervescent
feel
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
in
the
last
year
memorable
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
me
pours
the
color
of
golden
straw
with
a
bubbly
white
head
loads
of
carbonation
as
the
bubbles
just
keep
coming
the
smell
may
be
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
yeast
grape
a
bit
of
wood
and
brett
light
mouth
with
a
crisp
fizz
at
first
taste
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
but
as
it
warms
and
i
mean
really
warms
the
flavor
really
pops
im
cheating
on
my
wife
with
sofie
wow
great
beer
everything
i
love
in
a
beer
even
though
its
more
a
farmhouse
ale
than
a
withefbelgium
where
my
preferences
are
centered
ive
had
both
the
large
format
and
12
oz
4
pack
im
biased
towards
the
large
format
bottle
but
thats
probably
because
of
the
outcome
of
finishing
it
vs
a
small
12
oz
o
apparently
i
think
highly
of
this
beer
and
enjoy
drinking
it
o
i
wish
that
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
to
lay
down
for
a
while
right
now
it
is
a
solid
beer
good
flavors
very
drinkable
unfortunately
its
not
as
complex
as
it
might
be
still
it
is
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
one
that
showcases
how
good
goose
island
brews
can
be
and
honestly
something
i
think
is
better
than
the
bourbon
county
stuff
o
the
effect
of
aging
with
citrus
peel
was
much
more
apparent
than
the
influence
of
the
wine
barrels
not
as
sour
or
funky
as
id
expected
but
this
is
not
sofies
fault
multifaceted
lots
of
depth
to
explore
here
too
much
bitter
citrus
peel
for
my
liking
but
i
can
still
give
this
beer
respect
o
this
experimental
blend
works
for
me
despite
my
issue
with
the
feel
the
aging
showed
well
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
wine
goblet
pours
a
a
very
effervescent
glear
sparkling
cider
color
egshell
white
head
that
quickly
dissapates
the
smell
is
pure
apples
and
citrus
with
some
clove
and
yeast
funk
the
tastes
is
just
what
the
nose
percieves
nice
crisp
green
apple
and
a
hint
of
the
orange
peel
delicious
light
clove
and
a
hint
of
the
wine
barrel
comes
through
carbonation
out
the
wazoo
washes
the
pallet
and
leaves
a
semi
dry
aftertaste
overall
a
great
take
on
the
style
goose
island
keeps
doing
the
damn
thing
cheers
enjoy
o
another
winner
from
this
series
of
beers
by
gi
overall
a
very
elegant
beer
would
be
perfect
in
the
high
heat
of
summer
would
pair
great
with
fish
chicken
or
a
sharp
cheese
nicely
done
from
notes

dry
finish
goes
down
very
smooth
quite
sessionable
perhaps
a
tad
light
o
crossing
the
line
between
dry
white
wine
light
beer
good
choice
overall
really
nice
farmhouse
ale
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
taste
the
barreled
side
of
the
ale
along
with
the
orange
a
little
more
maybe
if
the
blend
was
a
little
more
even
great
summer
day
kind
of
beer
clean
and
tasty
overall
if
you
dig
saisons
and
are
open
to
more
sour
and
less
dry
then
try
this
one
when
you
see
it
o
definitely
worth
a
try
probably
their
most
interesting
years
round
beer
o
this
is
my
first
of
the
sisters
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
loved
it
it
hit
all
the
right
notes
with
me
even
though
saisons
arent
really
my
style
the
wine
barrel
and
orange
peel
really
set
it
apart

but
you
will
get
what
you
pay
for
although
it
is
not
a
traditional
saison
and
this
bottle
has
a
bit
more
age
on
it
i
can
say
that
i
did
find
it
more
flavorful
and
enjoyable

the

was

in

aroma
but
it
was
a
different
story
when
i
got
to
the
taste
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
like
to
have
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
vintage
to
see
how
it
changes

enjoyable
saison
that
utilizes
wine
barrel
aging
though
i
do
like
this
beer
i
felt
like
the
wine
barrels
in
the
bottled
version
kind
of
overtook
the
overall
classic
characteristics
of
what
you
look
for
in
a
saison
have
had
this
on
draft
before
and
thought
it
was
better
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
fields
pick
up
and
enjoy
and
this
will
be
a
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
trying
and
drinking
again

definitely

it
in

theres
a

of
bready
sweetness
that
flashes
at
the
front
of
each
sip
its
followed
by
the
orange
peel
and
pepper
interplay
that
so
thoroughly
dominates
the

the

5this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
really
good
beer
start
right
away
this
pulls
off
the
same
idea
more
successfully
of
taking
the
backbone
of
the
farmhouse
style
and
reimagining
it
as
an
american
pale
ale
this
is
a
great
all

overall
a
fantastic
ale
that
i
can
honestly
say
is
uptopar
with
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
i
do
like
the
basil
notes
very
much
for
9
99
a
4pack
i
cant
say
ill
keep
this
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
but
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
fresh
next
late
springtime
for
sure
bottle
opens
with
a
nice
crack
and
then
a
volcano
of
foam
that
almost
made
it
into
the
sink
when
it
all
settles
down
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
sweet
and
fruity
with
lemons
and
green
apples
dominating
the
aroma
theres
some
funk
in
there
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
spoiled
meat
luckily
its
not
to
strong
but
its
there
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
green
apples
and
honey
mixed
with
a
bit
of
funk
spirited
level
of
carbonation
medium
body
sweet
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
despite
the
misstep
upon
opening
this
beer
isnt
half
bad
o
an
excellent
saison
certainly
one
of
my
favorites
not
the
most
complex
nor
the
deepest
but
an
excellent
choice
nonetheless
this
is
a
pretty
yummy
well
rounded
ale
kind
of
a
belgiany
saison
thing
going
on
thanks
to
sweetwillyrolbar
for
another
tasty
beer
flavor
is
a
bit
light
and
dry
for
the
style
with
pale
malts
and
a
light
spice
profile
starts
off
great
but
doesnt
have
the
resources
to
really
close
the
deal
feel
like
the
taste
is
moderate
and
a
bit
too
one
sided
to
really
grab
you
overall
an
easy
drinking
saison
with
a
nice
aroma
that
lacks
slightly
in
the
depth
department
o
sucked
down
a
12oz
bottle
too
quickly
i
want
more
i
tried
this
at
a
beer
tasting
recently
and
decided
to
pick
up
a
4pack
its
pretty
good
now
but
im
going
to
let
the
rest
of
them
get
a
little
age
under
their
belt
as
some
of
the
other
reviewers
suggested
overall
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
was
not
sure
what
i
was
getting
into
with
this
beer
but
i
was
definitely
rewarded
for
my
adventure
excited
to
age
a
few
of
these
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
one
that
i
would
surely
buy
again
another
win
for
goose
island
a
decent
craft
brew
though
from
goose
island
would
try
it
again
good
but
too
much
apple
maybe
fermentation
temps
were
too
high
maybe
it
is
green
beer
and
needs
to
age
for
a
while
would
not
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
big
and
fluffy
the
smells
is
lightly
spicy
and
full
of
wine
barrel
character
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
there
being
a
delicate
saison
spicy
character
with
some
wonderful
white
wine
qualities
the
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
mouth
watering
over
all
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
that
is
widely
available
i
am
truly
impressed
this
beer
has
so
much
going
for
it
stunning
appearance
great
mouthfeel
and
excellent
balance
of
flavors
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
giving
it
5s
across
the
board
is
that
i
think
it
could
have
a
bit
more
depth
especially
in
the
smell
but
it
would
be
real
hard
to
improve
on
this
beer
this
is
incredibly
tasty
and
im
enjoying
it
a
fair
bit
biggest
beef
is
the
sweetness
which
with
age
would
die
as
the
brett
munches
away
need
to
get
some
bottles
to
age
allow
to
get
drier
and
more
brett
character
top
notch
d
nice
and
drinkable
i
would
drink
again
o
overall
a
very
solid
beer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
in
any
particular
aspects
but
it
was
very
drinkable
with
enough
balanced
complexity
to
slow
me
down
to
reflect
on
the
beer
this
was
bottled
121109
and
drank
81411
o
not
a
belgian
fan
but
wanted
to
try
because
i
love
the
other
goose
island
selections
overall
not
a
bad
beer
that
i
would
have
again
the
clove
and
spices
not
overwhelming
b
my
notes
hold
up
i
have
more
experience
with
sours
at
this
point
and
i
think
this
beer
stands
up
pretty
well
to
similar
beers
of
the
style
o
while
interesting
as
beers
in
this
category
generally
are
i
cannot
recommend
this
particular
saison
to
any
but
fans
of
sour
beers
with
a
strong
banana
components
perhaps
aging
is
required
o
very
surprised
by
this
one
a
very
awesome
beer
need
to
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
and
see
how
it
ages
got
one
already
but
says
it
develops
in
the
bottle
for
up
to
5
years
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
o
good
saison
that
can
hold
its
own
but
is
missing
out
on
six
pack
potential
especially
for
this
easy
of
a
drinking
beer
oexcellent
on
a
par
with
hennepin
which
is
my
personal
favorite
siason
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
there
was
a
huge
frothy
white
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
nor
did
it
leave
any
lacing
nose
is
mainly
peppery
and
coriander
some
citrus
also
the
taste
is
very
good
somewhat
lighter
body
but
very
flavorful
some
wheat
notes
coriander
and
peppery
notes
and
some
citrus
just
like
the
nose
subtle
yet
a
bit
complex
and
very
tasty
i
will
definitely
have
another
overall
very
nice
beer
worth
the
try
im
having
another
a
solid
but
unremarkable
saison
ive
had
this
before
and
will
likely
have
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
bottled
021111
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
grain
funk
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
grain
wheat
slight
funk
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
is
the
beer
myself
and
beermex2
used
to
warm
up
our
palates
while
waiting
for
the
others
to
arrive
a
really
nice
saison
with
just
a
hint
of
some
funkiness
for
some
odd
reason
i
really
like
saisons
with
a
touch
of
funk
everything
just
seems
to
work
and
this
is
no
exception
a
must
try
o
good
beer
the
aroma
frightened
me
as
fas
as
a
preconceived
possibiliity
that
it
will
be
overly
sweet
which
would
be
weird
not
the
case
the
tart
characters
were
done
accodingly
to
avoid
such
a
mess
this
is
great
summer
sunday
evening
beer
drink
it
for
sofie
who
is
feeling
a
little
sour
after
the
boat
ride
d
this
fits
what
i
think
was
the
brewers
goal
beer
for
the
dinner
table
i
could
imagine
serving
this
in
place
of
a
sauv
blanc
or
alascian
riesling
pours
an
opaque
pale
golden
color
with
about
a
half
finger
of
pure
white
foam
minimal
lacing
and
okay
retention
smells
like
sweet
banana
and
green
apple
some
spiciness
taste
is
a
nice
mildly
tart
apple
lemon
and
white
pepper
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
clean
flavors
pairs
well
with
food
and
is
great
for
the
warm
weather
odi
am
quite
impressed
by
this
beer
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
i
did
not
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
all
that
much
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
this
beer
drinks
incredibly
easily
it
begs
for
another
sip
i
really
think
that
if
i
had
enjoyed
its
mouthfeel
more
i
would
love
this
but
i
truly
do
still
like
it
a
lot
overall
i
dont
know
why
people
are
rating
this
so
high
its
nothing
that
a
saison
should
be
especially
if
you
look
at
what
the
standard
is
considered
fantome
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
has
so
much
wrong
and
it
is
not
to
style
at
all
no
thank
you
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
this
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
that
ive
had
and
would
certainly
be
a
recommendation
i
would
make
to
others
just
trying
this
style
for
the
first
time
a
nice
bouquet
and
full
flavors
that
dont
overwhelm
or
put
off
i
dont
think
i
could
throw
back
a
lot
of
these
but
certainly
worth
trying
again
in
the
future
pours
a
little
bit
cloudy
yellowgolden
with
greenish
tint
with
enough
carbonation
to
lift
a
full
finger
persistent
head
some
citrus
and
funk
along
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
and
spice
notes
the
carbonation
keeps
the
various
flavors
alive
and
interesting
a
nice
range
of
flavors
from
acidcitrus
elements
through
some
sourtartness
and
a
touch
of
sweet
spice
this
is
really
nice
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
took
what
i
consider
adequate
notes
on
my
tasting
but
frankly
i
was
busy
enjoying
this
with
near
the
end
of
the
glass
bacon
wrapped
dates
o
this
has
good
drinkability
the
flavor
is
good
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
it
was
very
tasty
and
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
overall
easy
to
drink
at
6
5
abv
treally
awesome
interpretation
just
enough
innovation
that
it
isnt
boring
or
played
out
but
does
not
drift
to
far
away
from
the
style
that
leaves
you
confused
on
what
your
even
drinking
awesome
ah
a
nice
rich
farmhouse
aroma
with
white
grapes
and
sharp
apple
and
horse
blanket
the
fruit
morphs
into
a
sweeter
creamy
frosting
taste
with
lemon
tart
cupcake
and
a
mild
cherry
finish
this
is
an
impressive
beer
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
mouthfeel
of
classic
big
bottle
saison
from
belgian
but
goose
island
has
created
a
great
take
of
the
farmhouse
ale
owas
feeling
bummed
out
after
not
doing
good
on
my
gre
but
this
beer
put
me
in
a
better
mood
it
was
my
first
go
at
gis
belgians
and
ill
most
likely
have
more
after
this
one
overall
this
beer
makes
me
feel
so
grateful
for
the
good
things
in
life
much
like
the
rodenbach
grandcru
this
beer
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
taste
of
bubble
gum
candy
very
refreshing
it
has
a
long
bitter
cloying
finish
which
i
think
gives
this
beer
character
definitely
a
beer
to
have
on
a
picnic
or
as
an
alternative
to
champagne
also
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
medium
to
full
bodied
habano
leaf
cigar
overall
impression
have
had
this
saison
once
before
the
tavern
and
was
very
happy
with
it
easy
drinkability
and
is
very
balanced
almost
a
thirst
quencher
during
a
hot
day
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
wants
an
above
average
saison
or
even
could
be
a
first
saison
for
some
upon
first
sip
the
carbonation
is
very
prominate
and
last
the
whole
time
there
is
a
bit
more
citrus
in
the
taste
but
it
pretty
much
backs
up
the
aroma
with
a
pepper
bite
this
is
very
refreshing
but
the
carbonation
was
toned
down
just
a
bit
it
would
be
even
better
it
finishes
very
crisp
and
of
fresh
grains
of
paradise
this
was
very
drinkable
and
well
done
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
as
i
drink
the
beer
it
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
in
my
tulip
glass
the
smell
has
a
nice
fruity
sweetness
to
it
a
smell
i
cant
exactly
place
it
seems
like
strawberry
and
a
touch
of
mango
and
citrus
it
also
smells
slightly
acidic
the
taste
starts
with
a
fruity
sweetness
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
i
get
some
light
malts
and
towards
the
end
it
tastes
a
little
bit
sour
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
with
energetic
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
different
take
on
a
saison
style
but
i
prefer
a
more
traditional
saison
o
i
drank
this
vintage
about
a
year
ago
and
i
am
positive
the
extra
year
in
the
bottle
has
served
it
well
lovely
mature
american
interpretation
of
a
saison
i
suspect
the
barrelaging
is
asserting
itself
a
bit
more
now
super
drinkable
do
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
the
aroma
was
highly
charged
on
this
one
lots
of
light
fruit
swirling
around
with
a
healthy
dose
of
spice
in
it
as
well
nice
touches
of
coriander
lemon
hints
of
pepper
coming
through
with
a
touch
of
pears
warming
up
to
it
as
it
came
up
to
room
temperature
the
initial
taste
was
peppery
with
a
rush
of
lemon
following
suit
almost
immediately
a
wonderful
sense
of
light
fruit
really
just
ran
all
over
this
one
i
was
quite
impressed
i
have
to
admit
smooth
mouth
feel
was
more
the
adequately
carbonated
and
really
just
kept
the
profile
popping
throughout
an
easy
sipper
the
moderate
abv
lended
itself
well
to
a
warm
late
summer
evening
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
nose
detects
sweet
fruits
and
breads
has
a
tart
taste
but
not
too
over
the
top
can
taste
apples
and
oranges
with
a
slight
wheat
taste
in
the
background
nice
and
smooth
with
great
carbonation
a
very
good
brew
from
goose
island
i
must
admit
the
post
on
the
goose
island
web
site
mentioning
this
batch
may
be
tainted
got
me
thinking
and
drinking
here
we
go
pours
a
light
yellow
colored
ale
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
apples
pears
and
some
nice
wine
characteristics
pleasing
the
taste
is
good
with
some
funk
mixed
in
floral
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
wildness
on
the
tail
end
lingering
orange
peel
on
the
aftertaste
which
is
actually
quite
nice
the
wine
seems
to
have
disappeared
but
i
carry
on
overall
i
think
this
brew
really
hits
the
saison
style
a
lot
of
the
americanized
saisons
are
off
the
mark
but
this
stays
true
to
the
style
throwing
in
the
20
belgian
aged
in
wine
barrels
is
a
nice
twist
a
good
beer
on
bottled
on
21111
but
am
curious
to
see
how
this
would
turn
out
in
4
years
as
the
bottle
states
it
can
develop
will
probably
buy
another
to
age
and
see
the
difference
overall
a
solid
great
beer
especially
in
the
hot
months
i
think
this
is
the
first
of
this
style
ive
had
and
i
can
say
im
a
fan
i
want
to
try
more
and
see
how
goose
island
stacks
up
even
my
wife
loved
this
one
i
hadnt
had
a
sofie
in
a
long
while
so
i
cant
attest
to
the
level
of
infection
this
may
possess
based
on
what
i
was
sipping
any
added
funkiness
was
welcomed
nice
and
refreshing
delicious
o
excellent
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
and
ive
had
a
lot
this
is
worth
seeking
out
o
very
good
beer
cant
wait
to
taste
some
of
gis
other
belgian
style
ales
i
think
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
something
butter
dominated
and
stayed
not
much
of
anything
else
came
was
pretty
sad
about
that
as
i
expect
nice
things
from
goose
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
too
didnt
buy
it
from
the
same
shop
so
dont
know
if
i
should
age
it
like
i
wanted
or
drink
it
now
and
see
if
i
want
to
get
more
this
is
a
very
excellent
beer
and
the
wild
yeast
character
with
the
light
malt
high
carbonation
and
citrus
flavors
meld
well
overall
i
love
this
beer
very
well
made
leaves
me
wanting
more
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
of
this
i
highly
reccommend
o
an
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
very
drinkable
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
a
lot
during
the
summer
o
sofie
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
a
really
nice
beer
ive
had
a
handful
of
saisons
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
and
this
is
my
favorite
o
great
drinkability
to
this
beer
the
flavor
is
one
of
mystique
with
each
tone
difficult
to
detect
sofie
is
a
mysterious
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
mostly
innocent
girl
that
is
worth
every
bit
of
the
trouble
she
brings
a
very
tart
saison
reminds
me
of
a
civilized
fantome
wish
i
had
opened
it
on
a
very
hot
day
its
extremely
refreshing
not
a
boring
beer
o
this
would
make
for
a
good
cocktail
beer
i
could
have
this
with
an
appetizer
or
during
happy
hour
overall
probably
the
best
saisons
ive
had
so
far
very
refreshing
o
all
in
all
its
a
very
nontraditional
belgian
offering
i
have
to
say
that
i
do
not
like
the
supertart
overtones
so
even
though
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
it
doesnt
mean
it
was
a
bad
drink
at
the
very
least
it
expanded
my
horizons
a
little
o
an
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
and
among
the
best
with
wild
bug
characteristics
i
am
truly
enjoying
this
beer
on
this
fantastically
sunny
day
o
what
a
well
brewed
and
refreshing
beer
this
comes
off
as
another
well
made
goose
island
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
have
drank
on
many
different
occasions
abv
doesnt
really
bother
the
beer
which
only
adds
to
the
overall
drinkability
to
this
beer
o
overall
this
beer
is
light
crisp
and
very
enjoyable
slight
funkiness
with
ripe
fruits
and
a
slight
tartness
are
all
well
blended
and
balanced
the
carbonation
is
perfect
would
recomend
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
regular
summer
beer
stellar
offering
from
goose
island
overall
this
is
my
favorite
beer
made
i
can
drink
it
anytime
of
the
year
month
or
day
and
be
perfectly
content
i
love
everything
it
has
to
offer
and
will
revisit
often
this
is
what
a
saison
should
be
o
this
is
my
ideal
saison
so
far
like
it
a
lot
very
light
and
refreshing
with
a
balance
of
sweetness
and
spices
even
a
careful
pour
yields
near
three
fingers
of
loose
and
delicate
bone
white
foam
looks
like
whipped
egg
whites
dimples
a
lot
as
it
rapidly
dissolves
down
to
the
surface
minimal
stickiness
to
the
lacing
bright
golden
hued
liquid
with
decent
clarity
what
is
does
have
is
a
veritable
maelstrom
of
bubbles
swirling
inside
light
enough
that
theres
no
discernible
loss
at
the
glass
bottom
or
rims
the
nose
is
a
tightly
woven
series
of
jabs
mostly
white
grapefruit
and
mandarin
orange
apple
pear
and
peach
scents
with
an
emphasis
on
skin
flower
blossoms
and
golden
honey
moments
of
clove
and
pepper
yeast
and
perhaps
a
slight
briny
influence
along
with
moss
and
other
forest
floor
matter
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
too
foamy
at
first
but
does
subside
some
with
time
also
churns
things
sufficiently
to
dampen
overall
sourness
lemon
white
grapefruit
mineola
oranges
a
fine
pair
for
the
clove
coriander
cumin
spices
the
yeast
and
bread
neither
too
dry
nor
sweet
helps
anchor
the
whole
in
the
center
were
there
more
tang
and
sugar
there
might
be
a
tropical
character
to
the
apple
nectarine
apricot
pear
red
cherry
fruit
the
grassiness
keeps
it
on
the
lowdown
tickles
the
tonsils
without
looking
to
get
up
in
your
face
factoring
for
the
carbonation
its
really
not
that
sweet
and
the
high
degree
of
citrus
keeps
it
on
the
refreshing
side
of
things
good
drinkability
bottled
on
21910
a
little
sweet
for
a
saison
but
that
sofies
a
nice
lady
very
girl
next
door
not
sexy
but
full
of
oldfashioned
lovely
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
a
visit
pours
a
hazy
mellow
pale
yellow
with
a
onefinger
pearl
white
head
doesnt
last
long
aroma
of
lemon
rind
bit
of
orange
some
barnyard
funk
nice
tart
lemon
flavor
to
start
a
bit
of
lemon
sugary
sweetness
as
well
sweet
and
tart
small
amount
of
grassy
and
funky
flavor
are
next
before
the
sweettart
lemon
comes
full
circle
to
finish
this
one
out
trying
too
hard
to
be
everything
to
everyone
id
rather
drink
hennepin
ive
got
another
bottle
of
this
that
i
think
ill
age
a
year
or
more
the
bottle
claims
that
you
can
cellar
it
for
up
to
five
years
the
acidity
might
be
the
reason
for
that
claim
but
im
dubious
about
a
6
5
beer
lasting
that
long
could
be
wrong
im
no
expert
on
cellaring
i
notice
the
mouthfeel
before
anything
else
its
too
syrupy
and
thick
almost
oily
after
that
the
taste
is
very
subtle
its
very
soft
on
the
tongue
almost
pale
ale
like
without
a
whole
lot
of
zest
sour
or
funk
all
the
fun
that
comes
with
a
great
farmhouse
im
not
crazy
about
this
one
it
tastes
bland
and
i
even
let
it
sit
out
of
the
fridge
for
10
minutes
before
pouring
overall
this
was
a
very
good
saison
and
i
would
recommend
you
pick
it
up
i
will
probably
be
trying
the
other
goose
island
belgian
beers
after
being
impressed
with
this
one
just
a
delight
to
drink
and
universal
enough
that
anyone
can
enjoy
it
overall
refreshing
beer
feels
slightly
heavy
on
the
grassiness
and
lemon
definitely
dry
on
the
end
perhaps
this
is
perfect
for
the
style
but
its
not
for
me
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
down
another
if
offered
again
nice
overall
i
wasnt
as
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
had
expected
to
be
but
it
remains
a
good
beer
maybe
just
a
little
too
tart
too
light
and
too
much
warming
alcohol
for
a
6
5
abv
brew
intended
for
warm
weather
drinking
probably
best
served
on
a
chilly
spring
night
this
was
delicious
and
paired
well
with
a
pizza
covered
in
crushed
red
pepper
it
was
light
and
easy
nothing
over
powering
i
will
say
not
nearly
as
sour
as
many
reviews
have
stated
i
found
it
quite
tame
actually
very
subtle
but
worked
well
o
well
balance
and
refreshing
a
great
take
on
the
style
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
overall
in
keeping
with
the
style
and
definitely
worth
a
try
goose
island
deserves
credit
for
their
yeast
which
really
gives
the
beer
much
of
its
flavor
and
aroma
a
bit
tart
and
dry
for
me
however
and
im
not
really
sure
id
be
as
keen
to
drink
more
saison
ales
as
opposed
to
wits
or
blondes
overall
a
solid
saison
though
i
tend
to
prefer
my
saisons
to
derive
their
character
simply
from
yeast
rather
than
additives
or
barrel
aging
i
will
give
this
one
respect
where
respect
is
due
the
brewers
at
goose
island
certainly
did
a
good
job
on
this
saison
cheers
d
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
would
swear
this
was
made
in
belgium
fantastic
interpretation
of
a
classic
farmhouse
ale
d
i
like
sofie
easily
one
of
my
top
5
which
is
why
im
reviewing
it
its
simple
not
extreme
or
over
the
top
and
pairs
well
with
quite
a
bit
of
everything
its
very
accessible
gi
crafted
a
fantastic
and
unique
saison
with
this
one
o
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
belgianstyle
beer
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
spectacular
and
it
has
such
great
balance
between
all
the
great
flavors
drink
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
i
dont
know
why
i
never
got
a
bottle
in
ca
but
since
the
company
was
paying
for
this
grabbed
this
one
in
a
sea
of
local
craft
and
bmc
i
was
a
happy
guy
overall
a
very
well
made
and
enjoyable
beer
but
not
something
that
especially
wowed
me
pours
a
clean
and
clear
light
gold
color
big
plume
of
prickly
white
bubbles
good
retention
and
lacing
first
whiff
is
lightly
soured
and
tart

rind
underneath
lies
a
clean
and
lightly
sweetened
malt
profile
with
some
hints
of
bready
yeast
funk
hay
and
spice
taste
is
wonderfully
complex
tart
and
sour
citrus

notes

white
wine
grapes
and
skin
clean
bready
malt
light
musty
straw
and
wood
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
active
carbonation
very
dry
finish
quite
a
pleasent
suprise
touches
many
different
styles
nicely
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
brewpub
saisons
are
generally
so
generic
their
wits
too
this
one
follow
the
guide
lines
but
makes
the
style
its
own
d
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
farmhouse
ales
really
crisp
refreshing
balance
and
flavorful
unfortunately
i
only
had
one
of
these
but
i
could
put
a
few
more
down
on
a
warm
spring
afternoon
like
today
would
be
very
interesting
to
try
this
one
after
a
few
years
might
put
some
away
for
later
tasting
jd
o
this
is
a
style
im
just
getting
into
but
damn
i
enjoy
it
and
this
one
is
very
nice
the
orange
is
noticeable
but
not
over
the
top
the
beer
is
quenching
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
gotta
give
it
high
marks
overall
and
very
enjoyable
well
balanced

dexcellent
all
the
flavors
come

perfectly
also
has
an
evolving
taste
to
it
which
keeps
it
interesting
but
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
zestful
tart
refreshing
saisons
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
consider
them
one
of
my
fondest
of
all
styles
of
beer
and
the
masterpiece
that
is
sofie
just
became
one
of
my
favourites
like
the
last
few
goose
island
bombers
ive
had
i
wish
i
had
a
full
case
of
it
id
stash
this
one
away
for
those
perfect
summer
afternoons
tastes
way
hotter
than
the
6
5
it
is
solid
beer
for
what
it
is
but
not
really
in
my
wheelhouse
o
im
very
pleased
with
this
offering
ill
buy
again
and
stock
up
on
some
to
age
everything
about
this
beer
is
bright
crisp
and
refreshing
the
appearance
is
a
pretty
straw
colorcloudy
and
bubbly
it
smells
like
spring
to
me
with
the
obvious
citrus
aroma
but
also
a
hint
of
grass
the
taste
includes
orange
and
yeast
the
beer
dances
on
the
tongue
with
good
carbonation
great
beer
d
i
like
this
brew
one
you
can
have
a
couple
glasses
of
without
it
getting
old
another
good
offering
from
the
folks
at
goose

d
this
style
usually
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
would
buy
this
again
cheers
d
very
drinkable
see
this
being
far
too
easy
to
put
away
on
a
nice
warm
day
very
drinkable
thanks
goose
island
dthe
carbonation
is
almost
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
and
i
feel
gets
in
the
way
of
the
flavor
profile
a
little
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
this
is
like
in
a
year
or
two
d
taste
is
very
nice
orange
apple
some
malt
pepper
and
i
noted
some
vanilla
as
well
mf
is
a
medium
and
finishes
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
good
in
this
offering
from
goose
island
a
great
saison
d
a
beer
to
try
worth
a
purchase
and
a
repeat
drinkability
is
good
and
i
liked
it
drinkability
a
very
tasty
and
easydrinking
beer
its
one
that
ill
definitely
pick
up
again
the
next
time
i
see
it
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
to
anybody
that
can
score
a
bottle
cheers
this
beverage
was
crisp
tingly
and
had
a
little
warmth
from
the
alcohol
excellent
drinkability
as
it
was
tasty
crisp
and
enjoyable
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
with
intense
carbonation
and
large
head
appears
almost
champagnelike
very
clear
head
holds
very
nicely
with
decent
lacing
loses
points
as
color
looks
slightly
like
urine
smell
is
nice
with
belgian
yeasts
and
slight
citric
notes
tiny
hint
of
funk
but
not
a
lot
lots
of
fruitiness
going
on
here
the
taste
is
awesome
and
although
appears
dry
upfront
has
nice
sweetness
in
the
background
that
tastes
almost
juicelike
great
mouthfeel
when
you
take
into
account
the
combination
of
the
zip
from
the
carbonation
and
lack
of
mouthcoating
which
gives
this
brew
a
very
clean
feel
to
it
drinkability
is
high
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
this
one
this
seems
entirely
more
like
some
sort
of
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
saison
pours
a
lightly
hazy
blonde
with
a
slightly
loose
great
big
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
the
aroma
is
lots
of
pineapple
some
bubblegum
some
farmyard
and
some
fresh
hops
the
flavor
is
dry
and
hoppy
and
spicy
and
features
notes
of
citrus
some
tartness
some
pineapple
lemon
rind
non
descript
fruit
some
pineyness
and
some
bubblegum
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
fruity
flavors
funky
flavors
and
a
remarkable
dryness
the
palate
is
sharp
and
the
carbonation
level
is
perfect
on
the
tongue
pricing
4
10
for
a
single
12
oz
bottle
not
worth
that
kind
of
money
in
my
opinion
2009
vintage
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
generous
white
head
it
produces
a
wonderful
aroma
dominated
by
that
familiar
wheatyspicy
belgina
yeast
also
some
orange
peel
aromas
as
well
as
a
sweet
white
wine
such
as
a
riesling
its
aroma
leads
you
to
the
complex
flavor
at
first
a
tart
citrusy
flavor
and
follows
with
some
sweeter
oaky
vanilla
flavors
drinks
very
much
like
a
wine
light
to
medium
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
snappy
finish
not
my
preferred
style
but
a
pretty
good
saison
in
my
opinion
drinks
very
easily
overall
a
citrusy
and
winey
saison
the
mouthfeel
was
the
highlight
for
me
im
definatly
glad
for
having
tryed
this
i
would
recommend
it
drinkability
this
is
great
stuff
when
i
first
smelled
and
tasted
it
i
thought
i
would
regret
their
decision
to
age
it
on
orange
peel
but
i
stand
corrected
the
bitter
orange
integrates
well
the
brett
character
is
subtle
even
after
7
months
in
the
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
hard
to
drink
slow
drinks
great
a
terrific
beer
in
every
respect
some
nice
flavors
going
on
and
i
appreciate
that
the
balance
is
skewed
to
the
less
sweet
more
funky
side
while
remaining
quite
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
however
the
flavors
dont
exactly
have
the
wow
factor
that
will
make
me
rush
revisit
this
particular
brew
unlike
goose
islands
matilda
etc
drinkability
i
could
drink
several
of
these
beers
in
one
time
nice
beer
not
very
common
that
i
drink
this
style
of
beer
but
i
will
consider
it
more
often
after
drinking
this
beer
from
goose
island
a
nice
offering
from
shytown
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
nicely
carbonated
that
gives
a
smidgen
of
resistance
as
you
drink
i
like
it
its
a
good
firm
body
to
uphold
the
flavor
and
its
an
all
around
amazing
drink
at
a
very
affordable
price
i
would
highly
recommend
drinking
this
beer
its
by
goose
island
a
brewery
i
love
for
their
consistent
quality
they
are
part
of
what
makes
living
in
the
midwest
great
find
this
beer
and
drink
it
if
you
havent
already
or
if
youre
like
me
revisit
an
old
friend
d
a
nice
slightly
heavy
handed
saison
definately
americanized
goose
island
continues
to
impress
not
my
favorite
saison
and
not
my
favorite
american
version
either
but
one
i
would
drink
again
in
the
future
none
the
less
delicious
very
expensive
at
my
grocery
store
10
but
nearly
worth
it
kind
of
sour
and
very
belgian
hints
of
orange
the
color
was
a
bright
gold
the
head
was
chunky
but
ample
the
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
and
highly
delicious
i
like
this
one
much
better
than
matilda
which
is
also
a
goose
island
reserve
the
labels
themselves
were
beautiful
very
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
this
is
really
a
beautiful
beer
in
appearance
and
smell
it
smells
like
grapefruitorange
flower
candy
with
a
hint
of
the
saison
barn
the
look
is
a
lovely
golden
hue
giving
great
head
the
taste
is
a
bit
sour
and
dry
i
would
prefer
less
carbination
and
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
that
is
totally
my
individual
taste
i
love
tripels
and
all
the
saisons
share
these
characteristics
this
would
probably
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
they
made
this
in
tripel
form
but
lovely
complex
and
wonderful
how
it
is
a
must
for
saison
lovers
i
am
reminded
of
a
farmer
sitting
in
a
barn
atop
a
hay
bale
peeling
an
orange
with
his
feet
sipping
wine
plenty
going
on
here
big
time
orange
flavor
as
it
opens
up
its
got
more
of
the
barnyard
going
on
originally
i
thought
there
was
too
much
orange
in
this
but
honestly
after
sitting
out
and
open
for
a
couple
days
i
like
it
even
better
still
has
its
carbonation
stains
dripping
down
on
the
glass
the
barn
door
left
open
this
time
obscuring
the
orange
trees
a
little
on
the
sticky
side
a
pretty
good
finish
if
you
like
the
orange
saison
combo
overall
very
good
drinkability
one
element
that
goose
island
usually
gets
right
and
sofie
is
no
exception
overall
a
different
beer
than
i
am
used
to
a
nice
representation
of
what
a
saison
is
described
as
being
a
solid
gi
attempt
to
expand
their
roster
to
incorporate
some
belgian
styles
like
sparkling
wine
with
orange
essence
d
really
nice
this
is
a
nice
little
spin
on
classic
saison
the
orange
adds
a
bit
to
it
its
nice
and
drinkable
maybe
not
something
id
seek
out
again
as
i
dont
regularly
drink
saisons
but
really
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
goes
down
very
smooth
and
clean
making
it
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
could
definately
have
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
due
to
its
light
texture
and
smooth
overtones
d
this
one
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
just
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
a
good
tweener
beer
that
refreshed
and
cleaned
the
palette
now
ready
for
another
the
taste
is
great
as
well
lots
of
flavor
and
yeastiness
orange
peel
citrus
sweetness
balanced
against
the
sharp
crisp
yeast
character
the
mouthfeel
is
good
light
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
smooth
to
drink
dry
finish
and
aftertaste
some
very
mild
pepper
notes
but
didnt
have
the
full
peppery
spiciness
like
some
other
saisons
but
thats
not
neccesarily
a
bad
thing
more
belgian
pale
ale
very
drinkable
d
i
could
have
a
fair
amount
of
this
its
missing
some
of
the
better
saison
characteristics
i
look
for
but
its
still
a
quality
brew
d
this
brew
was
the
pleasant
surprise
of
the
trip
to
gi
i
went
there
focusing
on
bourbon
county
stout
and
walked
away
loving
this
one
as
well
as
usual
the
fellow
reviewers
were
spot
on
with
the
recommendation
and
this
a
rock
star
brew
this
really
was
a
bit
of
a
blend
of
styles
as
it
has
strong
wit
and
saison
tendencies
but
in
the
end
its
just
a
great
brew
gi
should
be
proud
of
their
belgian
lineup
as
it
really
shows
their
width
of
expertise
find
this
brew
and
give
it
a
try
you
wont
regret
it
sofie
is
bright
and
clear
with
champagneesque
carbonation
and
a
nice
tight
fluffy
white
head
when
the
sediment
is
poured
out
at
the
end
the
beer
gets
a
little
cloudy
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
elements
of
a
belgian
wit
with
a
great
yeasty
character
and
a
hint
of
the
wine
from
the
wine
barrel
aging
the
wine
is
much
more
prominent
in
the
taste
with
a
good
yeasty
backbone
the
orange
peel
is
also
very
nice
the
carbonation
is
very
lively
and
it
gives
the
beer
a
very
light
mouthfeel
i
would
love
to
have
these
on
hand
all
the
time
it
is
a
really
nice
saison
and
the
wine
really
complements
the
saison
yeast
profile
d
overall
a
very
good
belgian
style
ale
im
quite
a
fan
of
the
saison
style
of
beers
so
this
was
definitely
a
winner
pleased
with
the
work
that
goose
island
put
into
their
high
class
line
of
beer
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
a
nice
plate
of
food
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
beer
has
nice
complexity
but
i
could
see
myself
drink
as
many
as
5
or
6
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
i
had
enough
this
is
a
new
favorite
that
i
will
be
stocking
up
on
d
i
really
am
enjoying
this
beer
tons
of
earthiness
and
depth
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
ive
enjoyed
it
many
times
and
hope
to
enjoy
it
for
many
more
years
to
come
d
the
abv
is
a
little
high
and
the
carbonation
really
bothers
me
so
overall
the
taste
is
nice
it
looks
nice
and
smells
nice
but
just
doesnt
sit
and
go
down
so
nice
notes
an
exceptional
belgian
style
from
the
us
reminds
me
of
duvel
but
i
like
it
better
very
easy
drinking
my
first
farmhouse
ale
a
relatively
expensive
pint
but
was
well
worth
it
like
six
bucks
and
some
change
would
go
well
with
some
aged
gouda
and
crackers
or
garlic
pork
loin
coq
au
vin
or
other
fancy
shit
wow
this
is
so
much
better
than
i
expected
nothing
i
can
find
to
take
away
from
this
a
small
ding
for
not
being
able
to
pour
it
reasonable
at
first
thats
it
each
drink
leaves
you
yearning
for
the
next
one
first
great
beer
of
2011
very
drinkable
in
the
right
situation
it
was
enjoyable
today
but
would
be
better
on
a
warmer
day
instead
of
a
snowy
day
probably
should
have
saved
this
for
summer
but
it
kept
staring
at
me
and
i
just
had
to
give
it
a
try
this
was
my
first
beer
from
goose
island
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
many
others
d
light
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
gulpable
even
im
glad
i
still
have
one
of
these
in
my
cellar
good
stuff
mild
farmhouse
flavor
and
rather
drinkable
my
only
complaint
i
wish
it
was
available
in
a
sixer
or
a
four
banger
hazy
golden
colorvery
carbonated
but
the
head
drops
in
the
time
i
get
from
the
counter
to
the
chair
great
aromasomewhat
of
a
musty
and
grassy
scent
hop
spiciness
and
a
moderate
earthy
funk
wonderful
sweet
and
maltywheat
flavor
musty
and
funkified
grassiness
for
sure
as
earthy
and
deep
as
the
flavor
is
it
is
quite
clean
and
crisp
very
distinct
lemonlime
quality
very
effervescent
and
lively
mouthfeel
an
amazing
beerso
much
going
on
in
a
small
bottle
and
package
i
bet
this
would
really
develop
over
time
call
it
a
funkified
saisoncall
it
damn
good
owing
to
its
outward
crispiness
and
bursts
of
citrus
it
may
not
be
the
kind
of
beer
to
enjoy
over
an
extended
session
i
only
had
one
bottle
and
was
quite
satisfied
by
the
end
of
it
with
no
desire
to
keep
going
but
a
single
bottle
of
it
is
quite
an
experience
drinkability
a
bit
like
a
saisonwitwild
ale
combination
this
is
a
signature
ale
for
goose
islands
belgian
chops
drinkability
another
great
one
from
goose
islands
foray
into
belgian
styles
very
enjoyable
and
certainly
one
to
revisit
frequently
aside
from
the
carbonation
issue
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
could
drink
and
have
drank
a
shit
ton
of
this
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
sofie
but
cracking
this
2
year
old
bottle
today
was
like
my
first
time
drinking
it
the
age
did
tremendous
things
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
adding
complexity
intensifying
the
mustyfunky
character
of
the
beer
and
somewhat
subduing
the
slightly
oversweet
flavors
of
a
fresh
sofie
fuller
medium
body
higher
carbonation
some
lingering
dryness
alcohol
is
masked
completely
a
really
refreshing
and
enjoyable
saison
from
top
to
bottom
overall
a
good
beer
and
quite
drinkable
poured
from
the
bottle
a
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
with
active
yeast
present
the
head
was
extremely
aggresive
for
a
soft
pour
and
formed
a
quick
thick
white
rocky
pillowy
head
that
did
not
recede
untill
into
the
beer
smell
is
nice
and
sweetlemon
herb
grassy
notes
perhaps
some
pear
and
a
earthy
yeast
funk
taste
is
bright
citrus
lemons
pears
up
front
witha
a
quick
twang
of
spiceness
and
a
bright
active
carbonation
to
make
this
one
lively
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
creamy
very
light
and
active
i
was
left
wanting
more
of
this
beer
very
solid
saison
from
goose
island
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
part
saison
part
wild
ale
spicing
of
a
wit
alot
of
thought
went
into
this
one
and
its
appreciated
d
sofie
has
amazing
flavor
and
taste
this
is
a
great
brew
taht
you
can
be
drank
all
the
time
this
is
a
fabulous
farmhouse
ale
with
all
the
components
you
can
ask
for
sooo
goooddd
mouthfeeldrinkability
pretty
light
on
mouthfeel
with
quite
a
bit
of
fine
carbonation
very
crisp
tasting
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
i
was
pumped
the
hotel
pub
had
this
on
tap
in
minneapolis
good
stuff
d
a
pretty
nice
saison
i
didnt
feel
like
there
was
much
brett
in
the
taste
but
definitely
saw
some
in
the
nose
an
easy
drinking
saison
i
would
try
again
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
nice
lace
as
the
head
settles
the
aroma
is
that
of
straw
lemon
grass
orange
and
very
mild
barnyard
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
the
citrus
really
come
out
in
the
flavor
and
are
nice
followed
with
some
mild
bitterness
some
floral
type
flavors
as
well
nice
wine
like
notes
as
well
a
very
solid
slightly
wild
beer
that
is
pleasant
to
drink
drinkability
is
very
high
as
long
as
youre
a
fan
of
the
barnyard
funkiness
i
had
the
2010
version
of
this
delicious
ale
i
poured
it
into
a
mug
and
it
produce
a
big
fluffy
white
head
which
took
a
while
to
dissipate
the
color
was
straw
like
and
slightly
murky
the
smell
was
an
earthycitrus
combo
the
taste
was
that
of
slightly
sour
lemoncitrus
lightly
hopped
and
it
has
fairly
high
carbonation
would
definitely
buy
again
a
musttry
this
is
a
perfect
farmhouse
saison
tart
and
crisp
with
enough
funk
to
keep
it
interesting
i
think
this
is
a
great
way
to
end
an
early
september
evening
i
sure
wish
goose
island
was
available
in
pa
because
i
would
be
sure
to
pick
this
one
up
again
d
could
thoroughly
enjoy
this
any
time
of
year
but
this
would
be
amazing
on
a
warm
summer
day
got
to
try
this
headtohead
against
the
style
prototype
saison
dupont
the
the
goose
island
beer
academy
held
in
bowling
green
ky
close
call
here
the
sofie
was
a
touch
fuller
and
a
bit
of
fruit
whereas
the
dupont
was
just
a
little
drier
and
more
funk
i
would
happily
drink
either
and
cudos
to
goose
island
for
this
close
interpretation
gold
with
beautiful
carbonation
and
a
nice
head
this
smells
like
white
grapes
yeast
pepper
and
orange
peel
and
the
taste
follows
nicely
lots
of
lovely
citrus
lots
of
identifiably
belgian
yeast
some
coriander
and
clove
a
little
bit
of
pepper
all
balanced
to
make
a
really
light
quaffable
amazing
beer
this
is
a
home
run
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
pure
white
head
fizzing
and
popping
like
a
newly
opened
2ltr
of
soda
a
tiny
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
that
sweeps
up
easily
pouring
in
the
sediment
gives
the
beer
a
much
more
wheat
beer
appearance
smells
malty
like
a
wheat
beer
the
flavor
is
really
sweet
akin
to
a
triple
some
good
hay
flavors
in
there
as
well
one
of
the
first
saisons
ive
really
appreciated
cheers
d
kept
going
back
to
the
glass
so
yeah
cheers
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
its
full
of
fresh
crisp
flavour
and
hides
its
alcohol
beautifully
the
lemon
and
wine
flavours
add
another
dimension
to
an
already
exceptional
brew
another
home
run
from
goose
island
d
this
is
excellent
as
good
and
complex
as
any
wine
d
this
is
a
really
good
brew

long
days
of

life
mouthfeel
dry

clean
notes
very
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
complex
and
balanced
drink
that
had
some
nice
funkybarnyard
aspects
of
a
saison
but
it
had
some
other
flavor
aspects
that
were
similar
to
a
chardonnay
a
biere
de
garde
and
some
bspa
aspects
as
well
it
definitely
had
a
nice
belgian
flavor
though
funk
fruitiness
grassiness
grape
and
sweetness
all
present
and
that
woodyvanilla
flavor
just
steps
it
up
more
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
a
great
beer
this
is
a
topnotch
farmhouse
ale
best
american
stab
at
the
style
ive
enjoyed
to
date
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
age
as
i
think
some
time
would
really
develop
a
pastoral
character
that
this
one
could
use
in
matching
some
of
the
better
belgian
examples
hats
off
to
goose
island
for
an
excellent
effort
here
like
champagne
too
much
is
not
recommended
it
is
a
beer
to
limit
and
love
goose
island
sofie
is
a
great
farmhouse
a
perfect
companion
for
black
sparrows
pub
burger
tart
and
assertive
it
was
not
aggressive
or
overthetop
its
a
great
saisson
and
represents
the
stye
and
goose
island
very
well
thanks
for
great
beer
d
this
is
an
excellent
saison
and
one
of
the
best
commercial
examples
that
ive
had
this
side
or
that
side
of
the
water
goose
island
makes
some
pretty
good
specials
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
a
zesty
and
complex
saison
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
plan
on
rereviewing
this
beer
after
cellaring
it
for
a
year
or
two
i
am
hoping
it
gets
a
little
funkier
but
i
love
the
experience
of
it
when
it
is
young
as
well
goose
once
again
delivers
with
their
belgian
line
beers
d
4
5
this
one
makes
sense
as
a
beginners
saison
but
even
though
sofie
is
not
very
challenging
there
is
a
certain
grace
about
it
that
continues
to
please
overall
this
beer
doesnt
really
fit
into
any
category
it
is
a
suprisingly
complex
belgian
style
ale
very
good
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
light
and
fruity
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
orange
peel
and
belgian
yeast
esters
its
incredibly
complex
with
a
light
wine
barrel
aging
character
as
well
the
taste
is
great
as
well
its
light
and
quaffable
but
with
tons
of
flavor
and
yeast
character
it
goes
down
so
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
bits
of
orange
peel
and
citrus
wow
what
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
masterpiece
of
a
belgian
pale
its
smooth
as
hell
and
so
tasty
good
work
goose
island
pours
superpale
yellow
almost
green
on
2nd
pour
a
darker
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
little
carbonation
smell
is
a
cavalcade
of
flowers
fruits
and
spicy
herbs
a
potpurri
if
you
will
first
taste
is
pleasantly
sour
and
rather
winechampagne
like
it
tastes
like
a
rustic
crafts
store
on
a
breezy
day
feels
like
the
finish
should
be
dryer
than
it
is
but
its
not
a
pleasing
and
bitter
herbal
twist
kicks
into
gear
and
dominates
the
aftertaste
a
good
and
very
unique
brew
kudos
to
gi
for
making
some
interesting
sht
i
poured
a
12oz
bottle
dated
in
late
march
it
poured
a
light
straw
yellow
with
a
hint
of
light
orange
to
it
with
a
billowing
white
head
it
smells
delicious
a
nice
blend
of
yeast
and
citrus
aromas
with
light
sweetness
it
tastes
excellent
as
well
once
again
a
great
mix
of
breadyness
and
citrus
flavors
with
a
subtle
sweetness
it
drank
very
crisp
and
didnt
lose
any
carbonation
in
its
six
months
after
being
bottled
this
one
is
very
very
drinkable
and
delicious
on
tap
or
out
of
the
bottle
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
aged
a
two
thumbs
up
for
goose
island
sofie
sofie
was
pale
yellow
and
hazy
it
had
a
towering
white
fluffy
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
yeasty
with
some
citrus
the
taste
was
spice
upfront
with
some
citrus
mainly
orange
flavors
more
spice
wheat
and
yeast
coming
through
later
the
finish
was
dry
and
lingering
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
liking
the
style
wow
goose
island
really
outdid
themselves
with
sofie
it
is
simply
an
excellent
saison
that
damn
near
passes
for
an
authentic
belgian
brewed
beer
it
really
doesnt
have
any
shortcomings
to
discuss
its
extremely
impressive
in
every
respect
do
yourself
a
huge
favor
and
go
find
a
bottle
this
is
really
great
stuff
sofie
2010
after
having
this
from
bottle
and
few
times
and
loving
it
i
found
it
on
tap
multiple
times
while
traveling
i
began
to
crave
this
throughout
the
summer
so
refreshing
showed
great
complexity
from
smell
to
taste
nothing
ever
stuck
out
too
much
sometimes
i
notice
pepper
sometimes
citrusbanana
sometimes
a
bit
of
funk
amazing
drinkability
without
sacrificing
intrigue
d
id
give
it
a
810
just
a
good
beer
filled
with
flavors
that
are
usually
kept
to
specialty
brews
i
e
guava
really
interesting
brew
have
one
gotta
love
g
i
wow
this
is
one
of
those
backyard
beers
that
ive
seen
quite
a
bit
of
but
never
tried
really
happy
to
have
had
the
choice
it
feels
like
this
beer
would
be
an
excellent
choice
for
a
spicy
food
pairing
very
balanced
and
the
hopping
lends
some
great
fruit
and
grass
qualities
im
not
really
tasting
a
saison
here
but
a
very
tasty
belgian
pale
as
part
of
such
a
fun
bif
reviews
are
just
part
of
the
game
unfortunately
this
was
not
one
that
i
preferred
thanks
to
jamnescameron
for
taking
the
time
to
include
this
one
but
my
personal
tastes
didnt
jive
with
it
d
not
quite
sessionable
but
you
could
if
you
were
using
5oz
tasters
maybe
its
the
two
other
beers
i
had
before
drinking
this
one
but
id
only
have
one
of
them
if
i
could
buy
these
where
i
live
id
stock
up
on
them
d
pleasant
and
refreshing
all
the
way
down
d
wonderful
saison
im
not
super
familiar
with
goose
islands
beers
but
if
theyre
all
like
this
then
theyll
have
a
customer
for
life
drinkability
this
one
disappears
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
american
saisons
and
possibly
one
of
the
top
two
goose
island
offerings
i
need
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
notes
i
am
really
into
this
beer
which
for
me
seems
to
blur
the
lines
between
the
witt
bier
and
the
saisonfarmhouse
styles
edit
32911
trying
a
bottle
of
from
121109
to
see
how
it
ages
seems
a
little
tired
honestly
not
better
for
the
age
maybe
a
5
year
bottle
is
good
who
knows
d
really
nice
and
enjoyed
by
all
is
on
tap
in
my
area
right
now
i
will
try
to
seek
out
note
for
me
this
is
not
as
refreshing
as
most
saisons
d
drinkability
scores
above
average
this
is
an
excellent
after
dinner
treat
or
a
refreshing
treat
on
a
hot
day
tastes
bret
edgy
with
some
tangy
sour
and
clovey
phenol
wet
malt
underneath
with
some
pear
esters
while
light
bodied
there
is
a
dextrinous
thickness
when
sloshed
around
in
the
mouth
pretty
simple
nad
the
brett
is
distracting
overall
rather
than
complementing
for
me
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
my
only
complaint
is
the
time
it
takes
for
the
head
to
fall
enough
so
i
can
take
a
drink
the
body
was
crisp
bordering
on
effervescent
finish
was
mild
tame
white
peppery
spiciness
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
a
wash
of
tart
fruits
and
capped
off
with
a
mild
funky
yeast
quality
flavors
really
meld
together
well
so
glad
ive
got
another
one
of
these
away
for
later
really
standout
offering
here
drinkability
is
lowered
as
this
needs
to
be
savored
id
find
no
problem
splitting
this
with
good
friends
highly
recommend
d
pretty
good
tate
is
bready
malty
and
wheaty
its
nice
and
sweet
with
kind
of
a
latex
banana
taste
still
very
rich
mouthfeel
and
nice
fruitiness
overall
a
quality
saison
that
i
found
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
quaffable
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
sofie
though
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
goose
island
specifically
in
general
ive
found
limited
bombers
from
craft
breweries
particularly
nonbelgian
breweries
producing
limited
run
belgian
ales
to
be
hit
or
miss
but
sofie
was
right
on
the
money
very
enjoyable
d
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
admire
the
fidelity
to
the
style
i
just
wish
that
this
had
a
little
something
more
beer
is
quite
tart
mild
fruitiness
in
the
midpalate
no
sweetness
up
front
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
the
carbonation
is
low
on
the
palate
just
like
in
the
glass
beer
is
kind
of
boring
not
boring
just
plain
its
a
very
mild
wild
ale
overall
its
ok
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
and
the
body
is
great
very
very
drinkable
d
a
fabulous
sipper
full
of
class
and
character
i
love
goose
island
and
their
devotion
to
quality
and
tradition
and
this
one
reeks
of
both
attributes
a
bright
shade
of
yellow
hazy
and
a
12
head
forms
then
quickly
subsides
sharp
aroma
with
a
slight
mineral
quality
slight
wild
funk
and
lemon
tarts
let
down
im
not
getting
more
of
those
amarillo
hops
but
this
was
bottled
back
in
february
taste
is
great
and
each
sip
seems
to
expand
in
the
mouth
from
the
high
level
of
carbonation
bright
and
sharp
flavors
of
citrus
with
a
lovely
bready
and
yeasty
finish
the
brett
is
adding
to
the
mix
providing
a
nice
undercurrent
of
that
unique
flavor
i
didnt
pick
up
wine
barrel
aging
qualities
but
i
wasnt
aware
of
them
at
the
time
and
not
looking
for
those
qualities
i
could
have
easily
drank
two
or
three
glasses
of
this
in
one
sitting
really
good
md
medium
bodied
a
bit
harsh
needs
some
age
which
is
what
the
rest
of
the
four
pack
will
get
and
at
that
time
this
review
will
get
an
edit
overall
a
nice
crisp
funky
saison
that
nicely
balanced
light
yet
suitably
complex
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
can
get
a
little
boring
at
times
though
still
recommended
huge
head
on
this
beer
just
nice
drinking
and
well
done
the
nose
is
very
very
mild
and
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
and
cloudy
the
taste
is
just
solid
and
light
and
fruity
no
specirfic
taste
to
me
just
a
very
well
structured
belgian
certain
belgian
styles
can
be
butchered
by
american
breweries
but
this
is
on
par
if
not
better
than
the
originals
i
had
this
on
draft
recently
at
rattle
and
hum
and
felt
pretty
much
the
same
way
possibly
finding
it
ever
better
than
the
first
time
color
and
aroma
were
pretty
much
the
same
but
i
think
it
was
even
nicer
tasting
and
had
even
better
carbonation
and
belgian
lacing
overall
a
very
good
light
belgian
style
ale
that
packs
a
punch
this
is
the
best
belgian
style
beer
i
have
had
from
goose
island
worth
trying
d
very
good
id
order
another
drinkability
pretty
easy
drinking
and
those
who
like
saisons
should
find
this
an
interesting
interpretation
from
gi
this
is
nuts
ive
been
attentively
drinking
beer
for
6
years
now
and
ive
never
encountered
one
that
was
so
different
between
the
tap
and
the
bottle
and
its
not
a
matter
of
me
not
remembering
the
bottled
version
or
the
vintage
being
different
or
anythingive
had
several
bottles
of
both
the
09
and
2010
sofie
and
all
were
spectacular
my
favorite
beer
for
these
100
degree
days
we
have
been
having
just
a
top
notch
beer
in
every
way
md
light
carbonation
carbonation
fairly
high
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
very
good
beer
overall
d
delicious
sipping
beer
it
was
highly
recommended
by
the
server
i
also
would
recommend
it
drinkability
this
is
a
really
exceptional
saison
light
bright
and
mild
fruit
sweetness
now
im
kicking
myself
for
passing
on
this
so
many
times
before
d
i
could
not
stop
drinking
this
beauty
seriously
great
beer
here
d
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
saison
with
a
good
taste
its
going
to
be
easy
finishing
off
the
bomber
myself
worth
picking
up
sometime
this
is
very
drinkable
i
ordered
two
at
the
bar
in
between
other
beers
had
we
not
come
as
close
to
closing
time
id
likely
have
had
a
third
the
only
thing
detracting
for
me
was
the
high
carbonation
which
made
each
subsequent
glass
slightly
tougher
to
find
room
for
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
rocky
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
barnyard
leather
horse
blanket
lemon
peel
and
herbs
this
is
a
very
complex
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
tons
of
barnyard
funk
and
enough
lemon
and
citrus
to
add
some
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
high
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisions
i
have
ever
had
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
regularly
drinkability
this
is
good
beer
and
apart
from
the
disappointment
in
the
pour
one
that
doesnt
disappoint
it
is
however
78
a
bottle
hennepin
is
an
equally
good
ale
for
23
less
yes
that
is
a
selling
point
at
sofies
price
id
rather
just
drink
belgian
ale
from
belgium
worth
a
try
esp
for
a
session
but
it
probably
wont
find
its
way
to
my
glass
often
unless
the
price
drops
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
i
think
goose
island
does
belgians
very
well
and
this
is
no
exception
saison
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
damn
good
beer
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
has
mostly
dissapated
nose
is
a
nice
note
of
light
fruits
taste
is
light
fruits
some
citrus
and
a
hint
of
pepper
midway
thru
the
glass
i
am
getting
a
bit
of
tartness
mouthfeel
is
classic
belgian
yeast
strain
light
and
smooth
and
very
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
some
complexity
to
it
yet
very
easy
to
drink
glad
to
have
tried
light
hazy
straw
yellow
golden
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
film
but
leaves
good
lacing
aromas
are
zest
but
incredibly
faint
refreshing
but
i
need
more
time
to
figure
out
what
else
is
there
flavors
are
refreshing
and
so
saisony
lots
of
citrus
wheat
and
general
happiness
emphasis
though
is
on
the
sugary
lemon
sweetness
its
almost
a
little
too
much
for
me
medium
carb
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
im
slightly
disappointed
here
but
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
in
a
bottle
overall
this
was
a
nice
and
welldefined
beer
well
worth
a
shot
taste
is
well
balanced
a
little
funk
a
little
sour
etc
not
as
much
going
on
as
hennepin
but
still
a
very
nice
saison
i
will
certainly
buy
again
great
summer
drinker
lovely
and
unique
belgian
inspired
ale
here
as
others
have
noted
it
brings
to
mind
a
tripel
at
least
as
much
as
a
saison
so
it
isnt
perfectly
to
style
wish
id
bought
a
few
more
bottles
to
age
as
the
wild
yeasts
taste
anything
but
at
present
and
im
curious
what
it
will
turn
into
over
time
pours
a
nice
yellow
sunlight
color
with
a
restrained
head
slows
little
lacing
swell
but
does
have
a
glowing
profile
aroma
is
very
acidic
and
refreshing
lemon
grass
grapefruit
orange
rind
and
some
melon
sweetness
comes
through
really
beautiful
has
a
nice
lemony
flavor
with
some
astringent
chemical
back
notes
in
a
good
way
really
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
also
has
a
meyer
lemon
like
sweetness
that
really
is
enjoyable
really
this
is
the
most
refreshing
saison
i
have
had
to
date
big
acidic
profile
and
a
really
nice
balance
with
sweetness
love
drinking
this
and
i
am
glad
that
it
is
a
bomber
tonight
d
a
really
solid
brew
i
enjoyed
the
balance
between
citrus
bitter
and
sour
in
the
flavor
greatly
give
this
one
a
try
drinkability
full
flavored
excellent
saison
couldnt
get
enough
many
tastes
compiled
here
tis
a
dry
tart
sparkling
ale
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
maybe
the
barrel
aging
and
addition
of
orange
peel
push
this
toward
the
witbier
style
without
the
wheat
component
its
an
odd
saison
with
a
spiciness
and
fruitiness
and
goes
outside
the
style
bounds
creamy
finish
does
not
save
this
as
a
staple
from
the
brewery
i
have
to
say
look
elsewhere
overall
a
nice
saison
with
unique
character
i
tasted
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
on
the
profile
more
than
i
usually
get
from
the
style
overall
a
successful
beer
crisp
bubbly
body
with
a
healthy
dose
of
wheat
and
pale
malts
farmhouse
funk
is
subdued
but
present
despite
the
fact
that
orange
peel
and
floral
hops
get
in
the
way
midsip
finish
is
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
wine
spritzerlike
quality
and
flash
of
white
grapes
mouthfeel
is
superb
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
to
complement
the
medium
consistency
and
clean
bitter
finish
leaves
me
wanting
another
sip
with
ease
all
in
all
a
tasty
belgian
from
the
talented
goose
island
staff
wish
i
had
another
sofie
to
see
how
this
beer
ages
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
in
the
aroma
candy
sugar
and
white
grape
small
tartness
in
the
taste
a
bit
sugary
and
balanced
with
a
dry
yeast
with
a
white
grape
tartness
all
the
way
through
a
sooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
semi
dry
white
grape
aftertaste
a
little
tart
nice
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
how
nice
they
named
a
beer
after
my
cat
spelled
it
wrong
though
anyhoo
this
brew
pours
out
looking
a
whole
lot
like
champagne
as
advertised
pale
yellow
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
lacy
white
head
turns
spongy
but
hangs
around
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
light
and
citrus
lemon
the
flavor
is
tart
and
citrus
also
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
smooth
and
drinkable
but
after
a
while
the
tartness
got
to
me
a
bit
still
this
is
a
very
decent
summer
drinker
d
very
easy
to
drink
great
quality
brew
for
sure
d
very
drinkable
apparently
the
goose
has
released
some
more
on
tap
and
its
just
as
enjoyable
as
this
bomber
pale
gold
and
hazy
in
colour
frothy
white
head
that
has
a
bit
of
retention
but
doesnt
really
stick
smells
of
bready
pils
malt
peachycitrusy
hops
and
peppery
spice
complemented
by
subtle
barnyard
funk
in
some
way
it
reminds
me
of
the
aged
manure
we
were
given
for
our
garden
by
a
local
farmer
this
spring
the
aroma
has
a
real
subtlety
and
depth
to
it
citrus
hop
flavour
is
enhanced
by
the
addition
of
orange
peel
while
the
beer
is
aging
in
the
barrel
mild
lemony
tartness
goes
well
with
that
citrus
flavour
a
light
dusting
of
pepper
is
followed
by
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightbodied
and
dry
with
loads
of
fine
carbonation
feels
soft
and
velvety
like
the
mousse
of
champagne
a
refined
elegant
classy
beer
full
of
comple
subtelty
delicious
d
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
instead
of
drinking
it
now
at
night
i
would
seek
this
out
again
good
job
gi
this
drank
great
even
at
4
months
in
the
bottle
sofie
just
displays
a
small
amount
of
brettfunk
and
a
different
type
of
saison
the
wine
is
light
but
it
is
there
i
like
where
they
took
this
another
great
belgian
from
gi
will
get
more
the
flavor
brought
a
little
bit
of
funk
in
the
first
sip
some
spice
swirls
around
in
this
one
mostly
clove
there
is
some
definite
fruitiness
going
on
orange
melon
and
citrus
the
malt
flavor
is
light
and
clean
the
alcohol
the
sweetness
and
the
fruity
flavors
become
a
touch
tiresome
in
this
beer
as
my
only
major
complaint
especially
when
im
expecting
something
snappier
and
more
lively
the
body
was
on
the
lighter
side
and
the
carbonation
was
appropriate
price
bottled
021910
label
says
orange
peel
which
is
subtle
enough
that
you
dont
notice
the
specific
flavor
i
wish
somebody
would
brew
a
good
saison
style
like
this
and
put
it
in
cans
at
a
reasonable
price
how
about
a
stella
artois
brand
they
could
call
it
daisy
mae
though
not
out
of
this
world
the
price
is
definitely
right
the
color
of
this
belgian
style
ale
when
poured
was
a
hazy
medium
golden
yellow
with
little
white
foam
and
a
nice
amount
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
fruit
yeast
and
spices
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
had
a
touch
of
citrus
fruit
lemon
and
orangeand
spice
coriander
was
nicely
balanced
the
carbonation
put
a
nice
finish
to
this
belgian
ale
drink
easily
drinkable
and
i
guess
a
reatreat
on
a
hot
humid
summer
afternoon
my
house
is
currently
83
degrees
and
this
is
just
what
i
needed
for
refreshment
this
bomber
will
go
down
like
a
12
oz
and
ill
be
wanting
more
im
sure
d
very
drinkable
yet
not
my
favorite
belguim
style
very
good
farmhouse
ale
d
a
good
drinker
part
of
my
summer
saison
saturday
seris
ha
sofie
is
a
barrel
aged
saison
brewed
with
brett
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
an
initially
puffy
white
head
that
subsides
into
a
thin
white
ring
could
be
because
this
is
a
plan
old
glass
no
lacing
but
again
could
be
the
glass
smells
soft
flowery
and
yeasty
cant
detect
any
barrel
or
brett
the
flavor
is
typical
of
a
basic
saison
maybe
a
little
more
depth
black
pepper
cloves
and
clover
honey
is
what
i
taste
from
the
yeast
grassy
noble
hops
and
basic
malt
backbone
smooth
luxorious
mouth
feel
coats
the
tongue
could
be
a
bit
drier
for
a
saison
this
beer
is
better
the
second
time
around
when
you
know
what
you
are
in
for
o
very
good
beer
maybe
just
a
tad
too
sour
not
everyone
will
love
this
brew
due
to
its
distinctive
flavor
but
i
do
fairly
straightforward
for
the
style
but
excellently
crafted
and
almost
to
the
template
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
but
theres
a
lot
of
flavour
here
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
quite
drinkable
i
much
prefer
the
bottled
version
of
sofie
but
this
draught
version
is
no
slouch
you
wont
be
disappointed
that
you
ordered
it
a
great
summer
option
d
a
realy
goo
beer
mild
and
less
complexity
relative
to
some
farmhouse
ales
a
very
good
brew
thats
sweet
yet
complex
light
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
good
beer
overall
thats
very
tasty
i
recommend
this
beer
as
it
was
quite
enjoyable
its
a
nice
brew
and
a
very
drinkable
one
im
unconvinced
this
should
be
classified
a
saison
as
it
is
here
it
doesnt
have
quite
the
acidity
or
rugged
musty
organic
characters
but
its
a
light
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pale
belgian
style
ale
the
thing
i
absolutely
love
about
this
beer
is
the
balance
of
flavors
sweet
tart
dry
fruity
wow
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
absolutely
love
it
im
not
sure
id
call
it
a
saison
though
i
recognize
that
farmhouse
ale
is
a
broad
description
that
leaves
a
lot
of
room
for
interpretation
but
this
feels
more
like
a
bspa
to
me
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
am
certainly
enjoying
it
but
i
couldnt
help
deduct
a
little
here
and
there
when
keeping
style
in
mind
farmhouse
ale
or
otherwise
i
found
sofie
to
be
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
regardless
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
and
id
pick
it
up
again
if
it
was
available
to
me
the
palate
is
quite
a
bit
better
with
a
light
floral
and
orange
blossom
honey
sweetness
opening
things
off
with
a
refreshing
cracker
character
spice
comes
through
midpalate
with
the
yeast
shining
with
light
pepper
a
little
clove
and
a
touch
of
lemon
and
grassy
hop
character
delicate
and
light
drying
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
light
body
thats
got
just
enough
heft
quite
wheaty
and
a
delicate
drying
finish
this
is
where
the
brett
comes
through
mildly
barnyardy
mildly
bandaid
like
and
a
touch
spicy
it
definitely
isnt
as
prominent
as
it
is
on
the
nose
something
that
i
find
surprising
with
a
high
carbonation
this
never
gets
to
be
taxing
on
the
palate
thoroughly
drinkable
on
a
day
like
today
not
the
driest
saison
out
there
but
very
very
good
d
a
bit
too
tart
and
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
nice
but
not
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
on
glass
i
smell
clove
coriander
lemonyeast
other
fruits
and
spices
its
nice
taste
is
better
nice
clove
and
yeast
hit
followed
by
waves
of
fruits
like
apples
bananas
and
pears
maybe
a
hint
of
pepper
and
a
pale
malt
finish
its
delicious
and
well
balanced
mouth
feel
is
flavorful
but
light
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
refreshing
will
buy
more
of
this
big
recommendation
for
this
one
drinkability
very
good
saison
worth
seeking
out
sofie
is
a
fun
saison
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
expertly
balanced
imminently
drinkable
this
is
a
good
bottle
of
saison
but
it
is
not
a
great
one
other
brands
take
the
style
to
another
level
with
their
depth
of
flavors
perhaps
sofie
is
a
little
too
delicate
still
this
was
a
beautiful
bottle
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
june
day
soft
and
fluffy
on
the
palate
delicate
but
wonderfully
flavored
slight
tang
from
the
wine
barrels
nice
spicy
belgian
yeast
strain
that
is
good
but
not
overly
funky
or
farmhouse
citrus
peel
flavors
are
quite
prominent
and
i
might
like
them
dialed
down
a
bit
grassy
hops
sharpen
the
contrasts
of
the
yeast
to
the
grainy
malts
to
the
barrel
aged
notes
light
alcohol
sting
complex
and
very
tasty
would
love
to
pick
up
some
more
of
this
sometime
and
try
it
with
a
touch
of
age
on
it
d
good
saison
from
goose
island
that
made
me
want
more
after
the
beer
was
gone
i
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
and
delicate
the
carbonation
is
tight
and
soft
at
the
same
time
excellent
summer
weather
beer
and
just
excellent
beer
all
around
i
want
a
lot
more
right
now
dthis
is
pretty
darn
tasty
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
toasted
malt
i
really
enjoy
this
and
love
the
thick
chewy
body
a
super
drinkable
beer
and
the
equal
of
hennepin
only
area
this
is
inferior
is
head
size
still
a
damn
tasty
beer
and
one
i
do
recommend
d
this
is
a
walkoff
grand
slam
for
goose
island
an
amazing
saison
and
hugely
recommendable
also
this
pairs
as
well
with
most
food
as
any
brew
i
know
of
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
plenty
of
zest
finished
smooth
spot
on
appropriate
in
the
feeltexture
beautiful
pour
with
a
slightly
hazy
golden
beer
and
a
pure
white
pillowy
head
that
is
refreshed
by
a
constant
steram
of
bubbles
the
aroma
is
gentle
and
tangy
with
green
apples
grass
and
some
very
light
coriander
and
clove
very
creamy
with
more
of
that
light
apple
found
in
the
aroma
appearing
on
the
tongue
along
with
some
smooth
light
graininess
and
fresh
straw
beautifully
balanced
and
on
the
creamy
rather
than
crisp
side
for
a
saison
beautiful
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
was
really
refreshing
after
a
long
day
of
doing
stuff
for
my
wedding

hit

spot

of
it

brett
excited
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
huge
fluffy
billowing
head
maybe
2
12
fingers
at
least
which
settled
to
a
nice
thin
layer
with
great
retention
and
webbed
lacing
smell
from
the
bottle
was
initially
very
citrusy
and
fresh
and
was
quite
the
same
when
poured
very
floral
citrusy
lemons
orange
and
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
quite
similar
crisp
citrusy
touch
of
sweetness
and
the
malt
feels
quite
organic
and
earthy
just
delightful
high
carbonation
on
this
one
initially
seen
with
the
head
on
the
pour
but
fits
the
bill
just
perfect
highly
drinkable
just
a
great
surprise
for
my
first
offering
from
gi
d
a
solid
saison
with
all
the
right
stuff
i
guess
my
only
wish
is
that
it
had
a
bit
more
pronounced
funk
this
one
is
overall
cleaner
and
has
a
much
fruitier
profile
still
tasty
though
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
especially
in
warm
weather
i
will
certainly
revisit
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
tart
malt
citrus
slight
spice
pale
hops
sweet
malt
and
slight
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tart
malt
citrus
pale
hops
slight
sweet
malt
slight
wheat
and
a
hint
of
spice
overall
a
good
aroma
body
and
blend
pretty
damn
good
take
on
this
style
i
enjoyed
sofie
and
would
get
it
again
goose
island
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
im
getting
the
impression
that
goose
island
isnt
screwing
around
with
their
reserve
beers
when
they
go
all
out
the
thought
and
work
show
in
the
beer
sofie
is
no
exception
great
stuff
the
only
complaint
i
have
with
this
bottle
is
that
i
didnt
wait
2
years
or
so
to
see
how
it
developed
before
drinking
it
guess
i
need
to
buy
more
the
flavor
is
a
complex
mix
of
spices
and
slightly
fruity
banana
notes
with
grassy
earth
tones
and
a
slightly
tart
and
crisp
finish
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
with
very
present
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
could
very
easily
go
through
a
bottle
or
more
of
this
especially
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
such
as
today
and
though
my
experience
in
belgian
styles
is
limited
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
so
far
cheers
update
my
initial
review
needs
to
be
updated
i
just
tried
another
batch
this
is
one
of
the
top
saison
type
beers
i
have
had
the
taste
is
fresh
crisp
citrus
spicy
and
well
carbonated
the
overwhelming
nose
is
gone
which
increases
the
appeal
well
it
has
been
quite
a
while
since
i
have
reviewed
or
tried
a
farmhouse
alesaison
typically
i
pick
one
up
every
once
in
a
blue
moon
overall
this
was
ok
but
not
close
to
being
as
good
as
some
others
i
have
tried
d
could
take
a
few
more
of
these
down
a
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
day
d
i
like
a
beer
with
more
punch
but
this
is
a
quite
good
belgian
perhaps
some
cellar
time
would
bring
out
the
flavors
a
bit
more
not
too
expensive
so
i
will
consider
doing
just
that
nice
for
a
farmhouse
ale
just
missing
a
little
sourness
overall
a
very
good
beer
worth
seeking
out
not
a
hugely
complex
beer
but
a
really
good
one
this
is
like
a
hoppy
sweeter
brettier
version
of
orval
funk
earthy
citrus
spice
cloves
hops
mix
the
smell
and
taste
together
this
beer
is
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
id
drink
this
beer
all
summer
long
pours
a
rather
bright
golden
color
with
very
slight
haze
large
bubbled
head
and
tons
of
lace
tons
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
that
is
mesmerizing
to
watch
nose
has
some
orange
funky
yeasty
aromas
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
citrus
flavor
with
light
wheaty
malt
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
smells
of
spices
and
fruits
possibly
oranges
and
ginger
taste
is
bitter
with
a
tangy
finish
the
beer
has
a
pleasantly
high
amount
of
effervescence
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
light
enough
it
wont
knock
most
people
out
in
a
3
drinks
i
burped
through
my
nose
burning
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
light
the
clove
and
citrus
dominate
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
almost
like
a
german
weissbier
without
the
banana
i
tasted
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
alcohol
was
completely
masked
i
know
g
i
says
this
can
be
cellared
for
up
to
5
years
but
this
is
so
refreshing
i
wont
be
able
to
keep
them
around
for
very
long
i
havent
had
any
other
saisons
yet
but
from
what
ive
read
this
does
a
good
job
of
being
representative
of
the
style
d
very
very
pleasant
this
would
be
easy
to
sit
back
and
drink
on
a
warm
afternoon
of
the
best
american
saisons
ive
ever
had
my
favorite
of
goose
islands
belgian
brews
so
far
d
very
drinkable
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
but
wished
i
had
a
couple
more
d
the
saison
is
moderate
strengthwise
but
complex
enough
that
i
dont
mind
orange
peel
is
a
key
addition
lifting
the
beer
above
most
all
other
saisons
that
ive
had
a
beautiful
ale
overall
this
is
a
great
one
from
goose
island
this
is
the
quintessential
flavor
i
look
for
in
a
saison
this
is
refreshing
as
hell
and
a
real
winner
for
the
summer
heat
taste
is
frankly
complex
enough
to
warrant
a
higher
score
but
it
helps
make
this
an
easydrinker
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
made
saison
and
it
is
true
to
style
it
is
exceptionally
rare
that
goose
island
disappoints
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
especially
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
if
i
had
it
it
just
became
available
in
california
last
week
so
hopefully
ill
be
seeing
more
of
it
around
d
low
abv
so
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
i
knew
i
wanted
more
after
the
first
but
this
is
a
pricey
beer
lemony
with
a
strong
shot
of
yeast
flowery
and
biting
in
the
swallow
light
hop
short
aftertaste
neutral
mouthfeel
a
good
saison
to
try
with
others
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
along
with
matilda
proves
goose
islands
talents
for
brewing
fine
belgianstyle
beers
so
very
easy
to
kick
back
with
on
a
beautiful
southern
california
friday
afternoon
here
at
tranquility
base
over
n
out
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
was
a
really
tasty
saison
not
sure
that
i
really
got
anything
from
the
wine
barrel
aging
that
was
20
of
the
blend
and
while
i
think
there
is
brett
in
this
its
subtle
if
so
not
a
big
fan
of
aged
saisons
but
this
one
may
develop
some
secondary
characteristics
over
time
but
the
5
years
suggested
on
the
label
is
probably
a
stretch
di
love
belgians
so
i
love
this
beer
its
got
everything
i
want
for
me
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
saison
without
being
too
crazy
d
just
an
exceptionally
made
saison
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
find
this
locally
thanks
again
ed
ive
wanted
to
try
this
since
i
first
heard
about
it
d
a
tasty
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
ill
buy
this
if
i
see
it
and
id
certainly
drink
it
again
a
solid
beer
a
little
bland
in
my
book
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
orange
and
chardonnay
notes
to
come
through
very
carbonated
great
for
a
hot
day
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
will
be
interesting
what
this
is
like
as
my
other
bottles
age
i
really
like
the
work
goose
island
puts
into
their
brews
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
saison
style
but
it
sure
is
tasty
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
above
average
carbonation
that
is
a
little
sharp
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nice
belgian
ale
it
was
nicely
balanced
with
some
very
good
flavors
pours

acton
ma
its
got
some
nice
qualities
but
something
about

falls

for

overall
a

a

too
sweet
and
too
much

for
me
22oz

i
bought
this
after
reading
the
description
the
label
was
nice
also
it
was
a
nice
orange
color
in
the
glass
and
smelled
a
little
floral
and
kind
of
odd
the
taste
was
nice
like
a
saison
but
with
a
definite
orange
flavor
to
it
the
peels
really
shined
in
this
beer
this
was
so
damn
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
d
this
beer
is
a
good
sipper
yet
is
also
refreshing
at
the
same
time
d
id
buy
this
beer
over
and
over
again
to
enjoy
on
a
sunny
spring
afternoon
id
be
interested
to
see
how
it
holds
after
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
im
on
my
way
back
to
the
store
to
buy
2
more
bottles
right
now
an
excellent
saison
in
my
opinion
light
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
well
refreshing
but
with
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
the
complexity
very
nice
drinkability
great
drinkability
putting
a
bottle
of
this
down
by
yourself
is
not
out
of
the
question
though
this
will
be
my
first
time
doing
the
whole
bottle
by
myself
i
foresee
myself
purchasing
a
few
more
of
these
to
sit
on
and
enjoy
over
the
next
year
or
so
as
they
conjure
up
great
memories
and
the
beer
itself
is
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
this
beer
is
really
drinkable
and
if
not
for
the
high
carbonation
would
probably
be
drank
way
too
quickly
solid
beer
for
a
reasonable
price
drinkability
sofie
is
deceptively
complex
i
enjoyed
the
mild

not

astringent
way
which
is
a
very
significant
accomplishment
for
a
beer
partially
aged
in

barrels
crisp
and
clean
a
little
hefty
to
be
considered
refreshing
a
nice
satisfying
beer
somewhere
between
tripel
saison
and
belgian
ipa
d
this
is
a
very
nice
american
made
belgianstyle
beer
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
new
belgium
le
fleur
misseur
im
very
glad
to
see
more
goose
island
around
everything
ive
had
from
them
so
far
has
been
top
notch
d
a
very
interesting
beer
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
saison
category
but
that
might
change
with
a
little
more
time
in
the
bottle
seems
to
be
lacking
some
wildness
i
think
i
will
pick
up
another
bottle
and
see
what
happens
in
6
months
worth
trying
d
tasty
and
easy
drinking
saison
very
nice
dyes
please
this
is
one
to
savor
in
quantity
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
better
american
renditions
of
a
belgian
style
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
happy
with
my
choice
very
drinkable
that
green
apple
juiciness
from
the
nose
dominates
the
palate
a
little
bit
of
tart
green
grapes
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
more
lemony
than
orange
as
expected
from
the
description
on
the
label
nice
toasted
grains
dont
overpower
the
tartness
in
fact
all
the
flavors
offer
a
soft
subtle
and
fragrant
balance
feel
mirrors
the
softness
with
a
nice
effervescent
carbonation
highly
refreshing
highly
drinkable
highly
recommended
overall
an
enjoyable
saison
but
not
an
exceptional
one
some
versions
of
the
style
are
so
memorable
but
this
one
is
merely
solid
d
i
think
i
could
put
down
several
bottles
of
this
beer
d
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
of
late
this
is
a
decent
member
of
this
style
too
early
saisonswhite
ales
tend
to
start
tasting
dusty
with
age
in
my
opinion
this
one
didnt
taste
old
but
just
didnt
really
distinguish
itself
from
everything
else
out
there
despite
the
initial
curiosity
over
what
was
described
on
the
label

very
good
now
im
thinking
that
a
few
years
to
soften
this
out
could
make
it
outstanding
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
light
in
weight
full
of
flavor
and
moderate
in
alcohol
will
someone
please
serve
this
at
the

for

should

to
find
this
after
sharing
this
beer
with
my
wife
over
dinner
we
were
so
into
it
we
popped
a
bottle
of
hennepin
immediately
following
and
we
both
agreed
that
sofie
had
it
easily
beat
gotta
give
it
a
5
in
the
drinkability
dept
since
i
immediately
ran
out
to
find
more
ive
heard
this
one
is
somewhat
limited
which
is
a
bummer
so
get
em
while
you
can
wow
cant
begin
to
think
how
to
describe
this
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
like
the
color
of
white
grapes
super
large
puffy
white
head
aroma
is
white
grapes
and
super
juicy
pear
with
a
hint
of
yeasty
funk
first
sip
is
amazing
not
sure
if
its
a
beer
or
a
world
class
champagne
very
bubly
but
not
too
much
taste
of
sweet
grapes
and
orange
and
all
kinds
of
things
you
cant
quite
grasp
its
all
the
great
things
you
want
in
a
belgian
beer
the
funkthe
fruity
subtle
undertones
plus
one
of
the
most
drinkible
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
cant
believe
i
only
bought
one
i
am
heading
back
out
tomorrow
to
stock
up
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
and
one
of
my
favorites
overall
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
d
this
one
is
good
but
i
didnt
really
want
to
finish
much
more
thant
a
glass
poured
from
the
nice
looking
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
sofie
has
a
monstrously
huge
white
head
and
the
beer
itself
is
a
slightly
hazy
white
grape
color
almost
looks
like
champagne
but
with
more
head
the
nose
is
complex
fruit
and
spice
stand
out
as
whats
there
but
there
is
quite
a
depth
to
both
the
fruitiness
reminds
me
of
pears
apples
white
grapes
and
maybe
a
touch
of
peach
and
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
form
of
orange
blossoms
the
spice
is
slightly
phenolic
a
bit
peppery
and
generally
more
reserved
than
the
fruit
very
nice
indeed
the
taste
is
similar
in
terms
of
components
but
the
spice
character
definitely
dominates
fruity
and
sweet
up
front
it
transitions
to
spicy
and
slightly
dry
with
a
bit
of
funk
but
in
a
good
way
based
on
taste
alone
i
would
guess
this
beer
had
more
than
6
5
abv
it
seems
more
present
than
in
some
well
done
bigger
belgians
ive
had
before
the
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
fuller
than
i
had
expected
maybe
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
while
reserved
is
still
present
but
not
in
an
effervescent
way
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
one
that
should
be
savored
it
would
be
interesting
to
save
a
bottle
of
this
for
a
few
years
to
see
how
it
develops
but
im
not
sure
i
have
the
constitution
to
do
that
d
a
superb
saison
and
overall
lovely
beer
classic
notes
but
unique
and
has
enough
personality
to
keep
it
interesting
could
drink
this
all
day
having
a
great
moment
with
it
on
a
somewhat
warm
but
breezy
early
evening
on
my
porch
after
a
day
of
cleaning
bottle
says
its
brewed
with
orange
peel
but
i
didnt
get
any
of
that
flavor
in
the
brew
but
good
nonetheless
i
love
this
beer
at
this
time
and
this
place
this
was
the
perfect
time
for
me
to
review
it
as
itll
probably
never
taste
as
good
as
it
does
in
this
environment
ive
bought
this
beer
a
few
time
and
will
continue
to
buy
it
whoa
rockin
good
beer
here
serious
world
class
hit
the
sweet
spot
wiht
this
sophisticated
yet
so
easy
and
drinkable
no
cloying
just
quaffing
poured
with
a
fine
off
white
head
and
a
litle
lace
color
is
a

spice

crotch
funk
an

flavs
bout

but
with

but
suckable
mmm

purchased
a
bottle
at
penguin
pizza
in
mission
hill
bottled
december
2009
split
with
my
wife
and
poured
into
two
belgian
palm
beer
goblets
very
pale
yellow
color
thin
whispy
white
head
smelled
like
chardonnay
taste
was
amazing
coriander
lemon
peel
and
orange
flavors
abound
followed
softly
by
the
aging
in
the
wine
barrels
so
subtle
but
present
a
perfect
amount
of
blending
by
the
brewer
mouthfeel
was
so
spot
on
for
a
saison
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
but
quenching
all
the
while
about
halfway
through
you
could
actually
feel
the
abv
a
bit
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
or
anytime
this
was
a
steal
to
pay
retail
price
in
a
restaurant
will
consider
picking
up
more
bottles
for
home
consumption
overall
this
is
just
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
i
like
it
a
well
done
beer
from
the
guys
at
gi
d
not
too
sure
what
i
think
about
this
one
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
a
saison
in
awhile
but
the
nose
and
flavor
i
associate
with
a
good
saison
are
missing
d
a
very
easy
drinker
hard
to
believe
this
is
6
5
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
perhaps
i
was
overly
excited
this
one
is
ok
on
its
own
but
would
really
shine
when
paired
with
food
e
g
milder
cheeses
lighter
chicken
dishes
will
do
that
with
my
next
one
style
note
im
not
sure
id
peg
this
as
a
saison
maybe
a
pale
belgian
style
ale
d
easy
drinker
here
wow
this
one
goes
down
with
no
effort
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
to
session
and
its
not
available
here
so
i
cant
say
ill
be
having
it
again
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
highly
recommended
2009
vintage
served
at
48
degrees
in
my
lost
abbey
stemware
bottled
on
121109
indicated
on
the
label
of
the
22oz
bottle
poured
a
semitranslucent
slightly
hazy
pale
yellowgold
with
a
loose
two
inch
bright
white
cap
that
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
quickly
dissipates
into
a
fizzy
skim
with
a
frothy
band
around
the
shoulders
nose
reveals
lemon
zest
candi
sugar
and
a
slightly
herbalgrassy
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
but
a
little
more
coalesced
but
its
the
mouthfeel
that
hits
you
first
with
an
aggressive
just
shy
of
prickly
carbonation
that
immediately
confronts
you
upon
the
first
sip
it
actually
took
a
minute
for
that
experience
to
diffuse
a
little
before
i
could
begin
to
recognize
the
flavors
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
slightly
oily
quality
and
a
bit
of
acidity
that
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
only
slightly
towards
the
back
of
the
cheeks
carbonation
reasserts
itself
at
the
finish
with
a
light
lingering
burn
all
and
all
i
found
sofie
to
be
tasty
and
moderately
refreshing
but
a
little
too
clean
for
a
saison
closer
to
a
saisonbelgian
strong
pale
in
my
opinion
nonetheless
a
tasty
and
respectable
offering
from
gi
sofie
belgian
style
ale
2009
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
a
brewery
that
does
much
more
right
than
it
does
wrong
im
sure
there
are
a
few
americanbrewed
belgianstyle
saisons
out
there
that
rival
this
one
but
i
cant
think
of
any
at
the
moment
what
a
tremendous
surprise
d
i
liked
this
much
better
than
some
of
goose
islands
special
releases
but
i
still
dont
know
how
much
of
this
i
could
drink
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
small
pour
of
however
pours
a
massive
bleached
bone
white
head
with
abundant
lacing
lofting
a
fragrant
floral
aroma
that
fills
the
room
has
a
bit
of
orange
zest
with
grassyhay
and
flowery
meadow
notes
yeasty
velvety
chewy
mouthfeel
with
a
light
crisp
carbination
and
this
22oz
is
not
a
problem
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
very
hazy
body
topped
with
a
two
finger
white
head
and
a
sour
aroma
and
light
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
also
sour
and
is
complemented
with
a
yeasty
hoarse
blanket
flavor
the
body
is
light
and
very
smooth
with
high
carbonation
and
allows
the
flavors
to
dance
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
also
sour
and
sweet
well
balanced
and
it
fades
slowly
into
clean
crisp
end

poured
a
deep
hazy
beigeorangey
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
mediumsweet
belgian
malt
with
some
notes
of
orange
peel
and
lightly
tart
whine
wine
is
quite
enticing
taste
is
a
wonderful
mix
between
some
tart
notes
from
the
wine
barrel
with
some
refreshing
notes
of
curacao
and
a
nice
attenuated
belgian
malt
backbone
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
done
overall
with
good
drinkability
factor
and
some
good
complexity
the
drinkability
on
this
gal
is
near
perfect
solid
hop
profile
with
some
mild
funk
in
tow
and
a
light
almost
effervescent
body
sofie
is
a
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
bomber
i
just
wish
that
i
did
not
pass
on
the
pere
jacques
oh
well
next
trip
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
big
soapy
head
settled
down
to
a
nice
film
on
top
smells
like
orange
peel
and
coriander
tastes
delicate
with
a
great
crispness
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
when
the
bottle
stated
the
beer
is
aged
in
wine
barrels
but
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
wine
flavors
from
this
at
all
it
tastes
like
a
wonderful
saison
and
was
a
great
surprise
d
ive
been
on
the
lookout
for
sofie
for
some
time
now
and
im
glad
i
finally
found
her
ive
spent
plenty
of
time
with
matilda
but
juliet
is
nowhere
to
be
found
at
least
pere
jacques
is
locked
up
in
my
basement
i
expected
good
things
from
sofie
and
im
more
than
impressed
refreshing
easy
drinking
thrist
quenching
a
little
high
in
alcohol
for
how
drinkable
it
is
something
arounf
5
would
be
nice
but
im
not
complaining
a
masterpiece
of
american
brewing
emulation
a
very
wise
maneuver
with
the
amarillo
and
orange
peel
and
a
damn
near
perfect
saison
note
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
this
one
develops
in
the
bottle
for
up
to
5
years
i
may
get
a
few
more
and
see
what
happens
with
time
cheers
very
drinkable
well
done
saison
unfortunately
the
8bomber
price
tag
will
keep
me
from
drinking
to
many
more
of
these
libation
all
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
sofie
but
its
all
very
complimentary
and
no
one
flavor
elbows
any
other
out
of
the
way
the
whole
bomber
went
down
quickly
and
i
could
have
had
another
pours
a
slight
hazy
golden
yellow
that
looks
beautiful
in
the
glass
thin
layer
of
creamy
bright
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
short
time
smells
of
hay
grain
orange
and
a
slight
lemon
zest
with
some
spicy
notes
in
the
background
taste
is
magnificent
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
at
this
point
in
my
life
the
subtle
spice
flavors
are
just
at
the
appropriate
levels
where
theyre
noticeable
but
not
controlling
the
beer
orange
barnyard
and
grassy
flavors
emerge
the
further
i
get
into
it
light
carbonation
gives
it
a
great
feel
and
i
definitely
had
no
problem
drinking
a
whole
bomber
by
myself
would
be
a
great
beer
for
summer
afternoons
the
aroma
of
this
beer
has
a
soft
sweetness
to
it
the
honey
and
orange
like
notes
that
doesnt
translate
to
the
mostly
dry
flavor
i
definitely
like
this
character
in
my
saisons
which
should
be
quite
dry
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
has
a
really
nice
mix
of
flavors
aromas
and
is
quite
easy
drinking
i
could
easily
stand
to
have
quite
a
few
of
these
bottles
about
as
these
will
likely
age
for
at
least
another
year
quite
well
without
having
had
juliet
yet
i
almost
wonder
if
this
is
the
better
beer
of
the
two
ill
have
to
confirm
that
when
i
crack
a
bottle
of
juliet
this
is
definitely
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
find
quite
enjoyable
my
22oz
bottle
of
this
is
too
quickly
gone
i
definitely
wish
i
had
more
of
these
the
drinkability
is
good
its
goes
down
very
easily
this
is
a
great
american
saison
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
plenty
of
complexity
and
a
quencher
as
well
very
nice
d
enjoyable
im
going
to
be
drinking
this
one
a
lot
come
summertime
very
light
and
refreshing
a
very
tasty
beer
very
nice
hv
d
goes
down
very
nicely
i
could
easily
down
this
bomber
on
my
own
but
i
cant
forsee
a
second
bottle
in
one
sitting
conclusion
this
isnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
somehow
but
that
doesnt
make
it
any
less
tasty
tally
up
another
win
for
goose
island
d
bought
it
at
the
local
krogers
as
id
never
come
across
it
before
it
would
be
phenomenal
come
spring
as
opposed
to
the
current
snow
storm
and
below
freezing
weather
ill
probably
pick
up
a
few
bottles
for
when
the
weather
turns
and
maybe
one
or
two
to
lay
up
for
a
while
i
suspect
it
would
only
improve
with
a
year
sofie
is
pale
yellow
and
cloudy
with
an
understated
grassy
funky
estery
smell
with
a
touch
of
tartness
and
citrus
it
has
a
wonderful
soft
bubbly
mouthfeel
like
if
somebody
made
a
wheat
champagne
its
smooth
and
delicious
with
a
fuller
body
than
you
would
expect
funky
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
a
little
bit
of
earthy
spicy
hoppiness
the
bottle
says
this
can
be
aged
for
5
years
and
that
20
of
it
is
aged
in
wine
bottles
i
assume
that
adds
up
to
some
wild
yeast
component
which
means
i
would
be
very
curious
to
try
this
in
a
few
years
md
overall
excellent
very
smooth
very
drinkable
very
tasty
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
despite
having
a
pretty
bad
cold
the
smell
and
taste
really
shone
through
on
this
beer
another
good
belgianstyle
beer
from
gi
say
what
you
want
about
their
regularlyreleased
beers
these
belgians
are
goood
d
wonderful
drinker
as
refreshing
a
saison
as
one
could
find
outside
of
belgium
or
france
a
welldone
version
of
the
style
worth
seeking
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
with
some
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
lemon
orange
wheat
light
funk
and
some
belgian
yeast
some
other
fruit
flavors
are
present
including
apples
thin
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
pure
white
head
that
slowly
settles
the
brew
kind
of
has
a
greenish
hue
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
sweet
from
what
appears
to
be
candi
sugar
with
a
nice
floral
yeasty
spice
light
coriander
and
clove
some
funk
and
horse
blanket
the
taste
has
a
noticable
horse
blanket
flavor
subtle
coriander
and
green
apple
has
a
nice
earthyraw
quality
to
it
the
flavor
is
not
very
strong
but
it
is
very
nice
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
sweet
and
floral
with
a
light
lemony
pucker
in
the
end
pretty
spot
on
for
the
flavor
of
the
saisons
that
i
like
not
too
funky
but
with
nice
yeasty
flavors
good
but
would
not
go
out
of
the
way
to
pick
up
its
funny
this
is
kinda
what
i
thought
matilda
would
taste
like
but
didnt
matilda
is
the
slightly
stuckup
more
refined
older
sister
juliet
is
the
young
effervescent
redheaded
cheerleader
sofie
is
more
the
smartass
semitomboy
girl
who
gets
straight
as
but
doesnt
seem
like
shes
trying
very
hard
at
it
plays
soccer
and
isnt
afraid
to
spice
up
her
language
with
a
few
fbombs
every
now
and
again
out
of
the
3
women
of
goose
island
i
think
sofie
has
the
most
personality
recommended

like
a
good

every
once
in

while
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
drinkability
is
high
i
can
only
imagine
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
oh
well
it
still
is
drinking
nicely
on
this
cold
winter
night
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
from
gi
clean
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
would
be
an
excellent
belgian
brew
for
a
warm
summer
evening
drinking
it
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
a
warm
fire
was
nice
as
well
d

with
the

abv
this
would
be
really
decent

brew
going
to
pick
a
couple
more
up
and
stash
them
like
to
put
some
age
on
one
for
grins
drinkability
is
wonderful
a
6

with
absolutely
no
noticeable
alcohol
and
depth
of
flavor
that
keeps
revealing
something
new
across
the
whole
drinking
experience
well
constructed
and
executed
d
wish
i
had
more
than
the
bomber
drinkability
seeing
as
this
is
right
up
my
alley
flavourwise
and
alcoholwise
this
is
a
cheer
joy
to
drink
and
very
drinkable
excellent
example
of
the
style
md
light
crisp
and
very
well
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
as
well
not
the
best
saison
ever
but
certinaly
very
very
good
d
this
distinctive
interpretation
of
the
style
is
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
yeast
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
fruity
saison
yeast
and
distinct
brett
mustiness
the
hops
are
subdued
in
the
aroma
but
show
up
in
full
force
flavorwise
which
is
a
nice
nod
to
classic
hoppy
saisons
like
dupont
and
also
makes
for
a
nice
contrast
set
against
the
yeast
the
finish
is
perfectly
balanced
and
unusually
champagnelike
which
leaves
me
thirsting
for
another
sip
great
job

taste
is

as
the
aroma

with
the
addition

mouthfeelbody
is

it
has
high
but
soft
carbonation
and
also
has
a

good
its
a
nice
and
refreshing
brew
i
liked
this
beer
id
buy
it
again
pours
an
ultra
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
two
finger
foamy
white
head
that
decomposes
in
3d
leaving
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
aggressive
earthy
belgian
yeast
lemon
orange
spices
and
banana
nicely
carbonated
the
complex
texture
of
tiny
bubbles
and
lively
bright
tangerine

the
slightly
understated

flavors
this
has
got
to
be
the
lightest
color
ale
that
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
wow
this
is
definitely
a
keeper
would
like
to
have
a
number
of
these
in
my
goto
stash
full
flavored
and
surprisingly
full
bodied
it
goes
to
show
that
you
shouldnt
judge
an
ale
by
its
color
at
6
5
abv
this
one
is
hugely
sessionable
this
one
from
gommers
midtown
in
kc
highly
recommended
this
beer
is
pungent
and
pulls
no
punches
this
can
turn
people
off
im
sure
but
what
i
get
is
a
very
well
refined
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
drink
that
has
its
ingredients
integrated
and
working
together
to
something
great
d
moderate
drinkability
abv
is
up
there
but
not
off
the
charts
a
bit
filling
however
a
good
one
and
done
from
the
22oz
might
have
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
for
the
summer
d
is
good
because
its
very
refreshing
and
light
could
definitely
drink
more
then
one
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
had
a
nice
flavor
balance
and
was
very
smooth
this
is
one
id
have
no
problem
trying
again
overall
a
solid
beer
but
a
bit
too
plain
to
bee
anything
better
d
for
an
american
take
on
the
style
this
is
going
to
be
hard
to
beat
drinks
nicely
and
really
hits
the
spot
d
this
is
a
very
good
saison
it
went
really
well
with
thanksgiving
dinner
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
light
color
and
medium
head
it
is
smooth
like
a
pilsner
yet
it
has
more
flavor
and
i
think
i
do
taste
some
of
the
orange
peelwine
barrel
aging
it
had
a
dirtyfruity
aftertaste
that
makes
this
beer
unique
in
a
good
way
i
might
even
try
aging
it
but
it
tastes
great
fresh
not
quit
at
saison
in
my
opinion
but
somewhere
in
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
ipa
get
this
one
if
you
are
in
to
belgian
ipas
or
if
you
like
good
beer
d
really
nice
complex
flavor
a
very
enjoyable
brew

vintage
bottled
on
1023
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
large
3inch
tight
white
head
that
leaves
subtle
soapy
lacing
down
the
sides
of
glass
the
aroma
is
very
standard
for
a
saison
earthy
herbal
hops
grass
hay
a
slight
musty
funk
and
lemon
zest
the
flavor
is
much
more
complex
basic
saison
flavors
come
through
grassy
hops
hay
earthy
mustiness
and
white
pepper
orange
rind
comes
through
as
does
a
slight
vinous
character
that
comes
through
on
the
tail
of
the
flavor
profile
just
a
slight
grape
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisply
carbonated
it
finished
very
dry
makes
the
mouth
quiver
for
another
sip
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
goose
island
hits
a
homer
with
this
one
definitely
will
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
to
put
some
age
on
notes
delicious
and
refreshing
take
on
a
standard
belgian
wheat
d
a
very
drinkable
saison
interesting
flavors
mixing
and
keeping
interest
would
recomend
a
big
thank
you
to
surlysober
for
bringing
this
beer
over
to
my
house
to
share
a
little
too
phenolic
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyable
though
certainly
interesting
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
of
alcohol
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
to
add
a
nice
extra
level
to
it
delicious
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
feels
a
little
watery
in
the
finish
but
nicely
spiced
and
very
dry
nice
funkiness
good
stuff
d
pretty
good
beer
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
little
too
citrusy
to
be
able
to
pound
though
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
someone
who
seeks
a
light
bodied
belgian
style
pale
ale
with
hints
of
lemon
and
unripened
green
grapes
too
bad
its
abv
is
a
bit
high
to
be
sessionable
overall
a
great
offering
from
goose
island
glad
i
found
this
when
i
did
because
it
didnt
last
long
i
will
enjoy
the
other
bottle
of
this
i
stashed
away
for
myself
recommendable
very
good
beer
not
a
breakout
but
the
lemon
dominant
is
a
good
touch
the
complexity
over
the
yeast
grassiness
is
nice
d
pretty
good
not
much
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
ok
very
soft
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
great
the
acid
from
the
citrus
and
the
fruity
yeast
are
a
nice
flavor
balance
and
easily
make
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
revisit
also
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
if
you
were
to
age
this
one
cheers
palest
yellow
on
the
pour
small
white
head
forms
which
is
gone
quickly
and
some
scattered
lacing
is
present
aroma
of
wheat
belgian
yeast
and
light
funk
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
nose
plenty
of
wheat
yeast
light
funk
orange
peel
very
light
oak
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
im
really
having
difficulty
describing
this
one
the
flavor
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
theres
a
touch
of
funky
cheese
that
i
cant
get
past
and
its
bone
dry
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
medium
with
crisp
ample
carbonation
gotta
say
im
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
ive
enjoyed
the
other
belgian
style
brews
from
gi
but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
there
are
much
better
saisons
out
there
drinkability
very
refreshing
but
i
expected
more
complexity
nevertheless
a
very
good
saison
that
straddles
the
saisonwitbier
divide
this
can
hardly
be
classified
as
a
saison
its
indistinguishable
from
a
witbier
as
a
wit
its
pretty
decent
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
whole
lot
more
d
very
high
split
this
with
my
girlfriend
and
roommate
and
it
didnt
last
long
for
anyone
excellent
beer
overall
sunny
bright
hazy
yellow
body
snowwhite
head
leaves
no
lacing
a
bit
of
sourness
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
i
think
i
can
also
smell
some
oak
from
the
barrel
aging
the
orange
peel
in
the
taste
makes
it
seem
like
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
witbier
bitterness
is
a
little
above
average
for
the
style
the
taste
improves
a
little
as
it
warms
overall
this
is
an
excellent
saison
that
is
both
flavorful
and
refreshing
highly
recommended
poured
into
my
glass
the
beer
is
cloudy
yellow
green
the
stark
white
head
is
two
inches
thick
and
rest
comfortably
on
top
of
my
beer
after
some
settling
the
head
leaves
gobs
of
creamy
white
lace
all
around
my
glass
the
beer
itself
has
gone
from
cloudy
to
almost
clear
as
well
the
aroma
is
a
huge
boquet
of
lemon
and
sour
apples
with
clove
pepper
and
yeast
rounding
things
out
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
fairly
closely
green
apples
and
lemon
are
rather
prominent
yet
thet
are
nicely
balanced
by
a
sweetness
that
caps
the
sourness
of
those
fruits
strong
clove
and
pepper
spice
abounds
with
every
sip
excellent
balance
sofie
has
a
great
dry
finish
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
going
to
the
top
of
my
saison
list
for
sure
d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
works
well
with
the
drier
fruit
flavors
and
the
wine
notes
with
the
orval
yeast
qualities
this
beer
is
light
but
has
a
great
mysterious
complexity
that
beg
to
take
another
sip
i
am
excited
to
try
this
one
aged
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
keep
from
drinking
it
now
im
looking
forward
to
pairing
this
tasty
brew
with
foods
like
oysters
or
chicken
with
spicy
mandarin
orange
sauce
sofie
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
can
think
of
a
number
of
other
saisons
that
have
come
across
better
d
deliciously
drinkable
i
dont
this
this
would
be
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
but
if
i
could
snag
one
on
tap
this
would
definitely
go
down
easy
on
a
summer
day
a
nice
refreshing
treat
on
this
hot
night
i
would
love
to
pair
this
with
a
white
fish
or
even
a
salad
with
a
citrus
vinaigrette
poured
a
clear
light
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
smells
of
spiced
apple
cider
citruslemon
and
champagne
very
delicious
taste
is
more
apple
cider
and
champagne
also
more
citrus
dry
finish
very
bubbly
effervescent
mouthfeel
all
in
all
quite
drinkable
and
delicious
recommended
d
its
okay
after
having
juliet
i
expected
quite
a
bit
more
out
of
this
one
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
recommended
drinkability
great
fyi
the
new
wine
labels
are
really
nice
and
simple
i
really
dig
the
new
look
of
goose
islands
more
rare
brews
theres
a
simple
grace
and
dignity
to
them
well
done
drinkability
a
good
saison
as
i
mentioned
above
this
ones
stylistically
spot
on
authentic
and
sports
the
spice
the
fruit
the
esters
the
subtle
and
wellattenuated
wheaty
sweetness
though
there
are
a
few
things
that
just
dont
click
for
me
this
one
is
by
and
large
very
drinkable
and
at
6
5
its
only
marginally
more
alcoholic
than
your
standard
ipa
or
pale
ale
drink
up
as
this
ones
very
solid
i
love
this
brew
i
have
had
juliet
and
matilda
but
my
mistress
sofie
bitchslaps
the
both
of
them
wish
this
was
something
that
i
had
better
access
to
pours
golden
clear
and
with
a
little
amber
hue
very
quick
head
that
leaves
only
ring
of
foam
after
the
pour
ok
bubbling
the
aroma
makes
me
think
of
champagne
and
light
triple
sec
very
dry
triple
sec
dry
champagne
and
riesling
wine
notes
mingle
with
toasted
pilsner
malts
the
hops
add
just
a
hint
of
earthy
funk
to
the
whole
palate
of
this
beer
the
d
pretty
decent
i
enjoyed
the
22
ounces
but
i
think
thats
enough
for
me
i
would
be
interested
in
getting
another
bottle
to
sit
on
for
awhile
and
see
what
flavors
some
through
in
a
year
or
three
this
is
a
great
saison
from
gi
and
extremely
drinkable
with
plenty
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
and
some
earthy
characteristics
that
come
through
more
in
the
taste
a
great
summer
afternoon
beer
goose
island
sofie
poured
very
pale
slightly
cloudy
with
a
very
good
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
was
full
of
nice
citrus
notes
the
taste
was
full
of
crisp
sweetness
with
fruit
flavors
of
apricots
showed
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
good
nice
carbonation
drinkability
was
nice
this
was
a
nice
ale
i
enjoyed
a
good
deal
i
hope
they
continue
to
produce
it
d
the
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
definitely
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
the
great
aroma
makes
me
happy
to
keep
bringing
it
back
the
crispness
makes
this
smooth
and
easy
on
this
extremely
hot
summer
night
in
los
angeles
yes
this
could
be
an
everyday
goto
beer
for
me
if
it
were
readily
available
and
the
lack
of
anything
overwhelming
at
any
stage
of
the
game
this
makes
this
even
more
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
drinkability
easy
drinker
d
nicely
savorable
drink
nothing
to
rush
through
but
relax
and
enjoy
pours
a
lightly
veiled
straw
with
a
classic
rocky
head
that
leaves
a
thick
resilient
lacing
behind
smell
is
light
corriander
lemon
zest
and
a
faint
smell
of
oak
this
beer
is
proof
that
subtlety
and
complexity
can
coexist
the
taste
starts
with
light
lemon
tartness
and
yeasty
breadiness
with
some
coriander
underneath
the
finish
has
flavors
of
citrus
peel
and
some
oaked
chardonnay
i
dont
drink
white
wine
but
its
kind
of
fun
to
pick
that
up
in
a
beer
youll
do
fine
swapping
in
sofie
for
white
wine
pairings
salads
light
fish
or
asian
flavors
according
to
the
label
this
will
develop
for
up
to
five
years
looking
forward
to
what
the
next
five
years
have
to
offer

didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
edit

ok
its
just
really
good
everything
works
outstanding
d
way
too
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
sessionable
too
probably
my
favorite
saison
and
boy
am
i
glad
this
one
is
going
to
be
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
while
at
my
local
bottle
shops
check
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
and
light
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
well
balanced
carbonation
a
bomber
of
this
brew
would
easily
disappear
on
a
summer
afternoon
overall
a
great
brew
and
the
orange
peel
works
great
without
being
overpowering
will
be
buying
more
of
this
one
d
yes
this
is
quite
a
lot
to
expect
from
a
beer
to
match
such
a
specific
expectation
but
that
self
important
label
the
passively
decant
bottle
design
that
if
it
were
a
person
would
probably
smoke
camel
turkish
golds
and
speak
in
nothing
but
back
handed
compliments
not
quite
sure
why
that
would
make
the
contents
of
said
bottle
any
good
but
ive
had
great
experiences
with
goose
island
in
the
past
and
didnt
think
it
would
be
any
different
in
this
case
oh
well
this
beer
is
probably
worth
another
try
but
for
now
it
will
just
have
to
stay
how
it
is
fresh
22oz
bomber
purchased
for
7
99
at
armenettis
this
beer
is
clear
golden
straw
color
thick
wet
foam
with
thin
dry
lacing
the
aroma
is
exceptional
an
american
saison
that
i
like
for
once
im
guessing
amarillo
hops
are
the
source
of
the
citrus
aromas
which
contrast
nicely
with
the
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
sharp
pepper
the
taste
is
sweet
and
peppery
in
a
complementary
way
i
think
the
closest
description
is
a
tripel
dry
hopped
with
amarillo
not
sure
if
this
matches
my
image
of
saison
i
e
dupont
but
then
this
style
covers
a
wide
range
of
topographies
the
body
is
more
or
less
normal
very
carbonated
and
maybe
this
adds
to
the
peppery
taste
an
extremely
good
beer
overall
and
i
appreciate
the
lower
price
point
after
recently
paying
about
16
for
juliet
pours
a
hazy
fizzy
yellow
with
a
big
ol
three
finger
bright
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
foamy
layer
some
thick
spots
of
clingy
lace
holds
on
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
crisp
and
spicy
lemon
zest
some
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
lime
underneath
all
the
fruitiness
is
the
slightest
bit
of
pepper
not
much
funkbrett
with
this
but
still
an
enjoyable
sniffer
taste
begins
with
the
zesty
citrus
fruits
followed
by
some
dry
earthy
flavors
some
funky
brett
a
touch
of
honey
and
green
apples
midway
but
for
some
reason
the
flavor
fades
rather
quickly
leading
to
a
brief
peppery
aftertaste
light
and
fluffy
body
with
a
lively
feel
from
the
full
carbonation
spot
on
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
gi
for
sure
but
i
wish
the
flavor
would
just
hold
on
longer
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
again
thanks
again
tim
i
was
disappointed
to
be
sharing
my
bottle
except
that
the
wife
was
loving
it
as
much
as
i
was
and
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
some
day
would
that
more
american
brewers
tackled
the
style
with
this
much
rustic
charm
and
gentle
complexity
d
highly
drinkable
light
delicate
flavors
great
summer
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
night
with
light
summer
food
the
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
a
soft
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
a
real
pleasure
d
quite
refreshing
nice
and
complex
an
excellent
saison
i
am
hugely
impressed
with
this
saison
from
goose
island
they
nailed
the
recipe
on
this
brew
the
slight
barrel
aging
and
added
orange
peel
has
done
wonders
for
the
complexity
of
this
beauty
its
not
the
most
traditional
of
saisons
but
id
have
to
say
its
my
new
favorite
american
saison
good
job
guys
taste
is
more
of
the
peppery
spice
and
just
a
hint
of
lemon
pretty
refreshing
and
enjoyable
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
but
good
none
the
less
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
now
on
goes
the
search
for
the
juliet
quite
a
quaffable
brew
warm
weather
or
not
will
get
back
to
this
one
in
a
good
while
medium
carbonation
somewhat
thin
but
decent
for
a
barrelaged
at
least
a
portion
belgianstyle
pale
or
a
farmhouse
ale
with
brett
very
nice
beer
and
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
with
some
age
on
it
this
is
a
really
nice
blended
saison
style
from
goose
its
got
a
nice
effervescence
and
aromas
of
citrus
and
orange
the
orange
peel
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
my
only
complaint
is
its
still
slightly
young
on
the
palate
its
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
but
i
think
its
got
some
great
potential
to
shape
up
really
nicely
d
good
price
good
complexity
good
aging
potential
would
definately
revisit
and
would
recomend
to
others
maybe
not
the
best
belgian
but
quite
good
d
i
am
guessing
this
is
matilda
with
orange
peel
aged
in
wine
barrels
almost
like
a
skilled
blender
mixed
matilda
and
a
wit
into
a
complex
wonderful
beer
very
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
while
not
a
funky
brett
bomb
or
a
citrus
explosion
it
contains
both
of
those
elements
to
varying
degrees
it
also
contains
a
fair
amount

that
in
no
way
steps
on
anything
else
going
on
here
everything
works
in
concert
with
everything
else
here
and
is
dare
i
say
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
ive
ever
tasted
mouthfeel
is
extremely
creamy
very
smooth
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
worthy
of
your
attention
light
tartness
from
the
yeast
or
barrel
bugs
but
its
oh
so
soft
and
creamy
orange
peel
and
delicate
belgian
yeast
dances
over
a
light
malty
base
dry
finish
with
some
noble
hop
herbals
utterly
quaffable
and
refreshing
ive
only
experienced
this
soft
lightness
before
in
a
few
belgians
namely
fantome
troublette
and
other
rusticstyle
saisons
wits
this
is
one
ill
return
to
again
and
again
paired
nicely
with
a
washed
rind
cheese
jasper
hill
winnimere
glass
4oz
tasting
glass
very
tasty
unexpected
saison
very
much
a
porter
feel
to
it
and
it
was
awesome
overall
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
cellar
the
bottles
say
that
they
can
be
aged
for
up
to
5
years
im
going
to
keep
some
around
for
at
least
that
long
i
really
like
this
take
on
a
belgian
ale
the
pepper
is
very
subtle
but
there
overall
pepe
nero
is
a
different
saisonfarmhouse
style
ale
than
i
am
accustom
to
this
black
saisonfarmhouse
ale
i
feel
is
best
enjoyed
in
the
cooler
months
of
fall
and
winter
if
you
are
looking
for
a
different
take
on
the
style
it
is
worth
a
try
i
for
one
prefer
a
more
traditional
saisonfarmhouse
ale
dont
judge
a
book
or
in
this
case
a
beer
by
its
cover
poured
dark
but
had
a
nice
smooth
and
light
taste
overall
i
can
only
assume
that
almost
three
years
in
the
bottle
has
softened
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
remember
it
having
more
of
a
peppery
note
and
a
bit
more
edge
its
components
stood
out
more
its
quite
rounded
at
this
point
and
im
not
sure
that
that
really
works
i
would
imagine
that
early
last
year
was
probably
its
sweet
spot

a
bit
peppery
does
not
have
much
length
to
it
this
would
probably
have
been
better
after
one
year
of
aging
it
has
the
thin
qualities
of
a
two

belgian
that
is
why
i
give
it
a
higher
rating
than
it
deserves
still
you
can

with

the

is

just
maybe
a

at

this

the

the

clash
with
the

characteristics
of

glad

25overall
its
decent
but
the
beer
doesnt
go
anywhere
the
label
says
belgian
ale
ba
has
it
tagged
as
a
saison
but
it
really
just
tastes
like
a
unremarkable
brown
ale
with
some
spicy
nuances
o
while
the
peppercorns
do
not
overwhelm
the
beer
they
do
reduce
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
of
a
saison
making
a
little
one
note
for
me
still
an
enjoyable
beer
the
addition
of
the
peppercorns
make
this
one
more
of
a
sipper
than
an
easy
drinker
i
guess
i
would
call
this
one
a
black
saison
atmosphere
is
really
nice
large
frothy
head
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
bready
with
a
citrus
flavor
is
completely
different
roasted
coffee
accentuated
with
dark
chocolate
and
hints
of
raspberry
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
good
beer
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
extremely
smooth
almost
velvety
medium
body
pretty
low
carbonation
a
very
nice
drink
overall
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
really
a
saison
though
more
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
strong
dark
and
an
english
dark
nevertheless
a
couple
of
my
favorite
styles
so
i
will
go
with
it
2012
bottle
i
gotta
say
i
have
never
seen
a
saisonfarmhouse
belgian
this
dark
in
colorits
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
great
looking
fluffy
one
and
a
half
finger
light
beige
head
atop
that
spits
and
billows
as
settles
oh
so
slowly
in
my
chalice
aromas
of
candied
sugar
and
hard
toffeea
light
peppery
spice
is
detected
dark
fruit
and
toffee
flavors
with
a
smack
of
pepper
in
the
finish
wich
i
likedark
fruits
as
required
are
there
although
the
bottle
may
say
farmouse
this
isnt
a
farmhouse
beerits
a
belgian
dark
with
peppercorns
and
its
pretty
damn
good
overall
worth
a
try
the
body
is
not
real
heavy
so
any
time
of
year
works
well
for
this
dark
brew
definitely
in
its
own
league
pepe
nero
is
polarizing
i
think
gi
had
noble
intentions
in
making
this
beer
and
while
it
has
nice
flavor
theres
note
a
lot
of
unity
here
and
thats
what
harms
its
drinkability
worth
checking
out
i
suppose
if
youre
feeling
on
the
adventurous
side
has
a
medium
mouthful
with
a
delightfully
spicy
carbonation
that
really
tingles
the
carb
probably
doesnt
really
exceed
medium
or
maybe
barely
but
it
makes
all
the
difference
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
brown
with
a
large
long
lasting
tan
head
good
lacing
aroma
and
taste
of
dark
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
molasses
brown
sugar
and
yeast
along
with
some
sweet
spices
and
bitter
hops
fill
the
senses
a
medium
to
full
body
slightly
sticky
with
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
finish
is
sweet
dark
roasted
caramel
malt
yeast
dark
fruit
molasses
some
sweet
spicy
notes
and
good
bitter
hops
for
balance
a
very
good
flavorful
and
well
balanced
brew
poured
a
brownish
body
slight
reddish
tint
with
two
finger
brownish
head
that
died
quick
and
not
much
lace
on
top
of
a
strong
malt
aroma
strong
than
is
typical
for
this
style
and
the
yeast
and
tropical
fruits
are
background
material
beer
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
but
i
think
i
just
am
being
picky
about
style
points
rather
than
dont
think
this
is
a
great
beer
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
the
sweet
and
somewhat
roasted
malts
along
with
some
spice
and
touches
of
yeast
and
tropical
fruit
but
it
just
didnt
come
together
as
a
whole
for
me
overall
a
very
nice
and
unique
saison
while
it
could
stand
to
be
dried
out
a
little
more
it
is
one
that
i
would
not
have
a
problem
drinking
again
overall
pretty
tasty
beer
will
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
again
but
this
one
had
great
flavor
worth
a
try
by
any
belgian
beer
fan
very
decent
beer
overall
and
it
requires
a
slow
careful
poor
if
you
do
not
want
much
foam
overall
quite
a
nice
dark
saison
in
terms
of
goose
island
saisons
i
would
go
with
sofie
before
this
one
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
drink
i
didnt
realize
initially
that
i
was
drinking
a
2year
old
aged
beer
id
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
another
winner
from
the
goose
o
this
may
be
the
most
confusing
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
a
while
it
calls
itself
a
farmhousesaison
but
it
has
a
lot
of
bsda
qualities
as
well
it
is
not
an
unpleasant
beer
i
have
to
wonder
if
perhaps
it
is
just
immature
i
have
another
bottle
that
i
will
leave
for
a
while
and
then
i
will
revisit
this
lets
see
what
that
brings
o
this
was
a
very
good
beer
not
as
saisony
as
i
expected
more
roasty
and
malty
than
anything
else
overall
not
a
bad
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it

hardly

this
is
an

all
around
nice

and
very

to

a
very

offering
this
is
a
nice
beer
sort
of
a
style
bender
id
say
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
belgian
dark
ales
it
veers
away
from
saison
territory
quite
a
bit
still
worth
a
try
for
sure
very
interesting
dark
saison
enjoyable
overall
this
is
so
different
than
anything
i
have
had
before
unique
and
tasty
definitely
one
to
try
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
variation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
bit
different
bubbly
beer
yet
it
retains
a
thickness
that
corresponds
to
its
heavy
color
well
light
prickly
feel
not
surprising
the
boldness
in
this
one
is
tamed
by
time
no
doubt
some
yeast
spiciness
mild
sweetness
pulls
through
and
a
decent
roasted
aftertaste
this
is
more
in
line
with
a
belgian
stout
rather
than
a
saison
but
whatever
not
bad
thanks
jacob
for
the
pour
there
is
a
bit
of
a
grainy
feeling
to
this
beer
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
there
is
a
dark
roasted
malt
aftertaste
which
is
too
noticeable
if
it
played
a
smaller
supporting
role
it
might
be
okay
as
it
is
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
but
dont
plan
to
seek
it
out
again
a
decent
beer
to
drink
not
really
a
top
example
of
a
black
saison
though
fun
to
try
overall
perhaps
a
touch
too
carbonated
but
a
nice
flavour
that
is
potent
but
not
too
robust
not
something
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
definitely
an
interesting
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying
overall
i
really
would
not
buy
it
again
as
the
taste
is
too
dull
when
theres
so
much
more
out
there
this
is
not
a
good
offering
from
goose
island
it
comes
in
a
beautiful
bottle
now
though
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
and
would
recommend
people
avoid
this
taste
is
thin
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolatecoffee
in
the
background
not
a
very
impressive
taste
profile
o
another
excellent
brew
by
goose
island
i
would
grab
this
again
and
cellar
it
for
awhile
overall
fairly
good
taste
is
a
bit
weak
though
notes
tasty
imagine
a
porter
with
belgian
yeast
and
a
few
spices
very
unique
quite
good
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
i
imagine
the
fact
that
this
particular
example
was
bottled
2
years
ago
3411
doesnt
hurt
but
this
could
end
up
being
a
goto
brew
for
my
cellar
just
great
a
nice
quaff
i
like
it
for
the
unique
combo
of
pepperspice
and
smokey
aftertaste
also
big
plus
for
the
kalamata
olive
nose
a
brew
id
drink
again
interesting
sort
of
works
but
not
sure
how
much
of
this
style
i
would
enjoy
o
i
like
the
dark
twist
on
the
saison
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
saison
with
some
roasted
malt
character
viscous
texture
of
a
stout
and
dry
im
not
as
into
the
milky
stouts
so
this
plays
well
o
i
dont
normally
prefer
saisons
including
sofie
but
found
the
dry
spicy
pepperiness
of
this
one
to
elevate
it
beyond
the
normal
expectations
of
the
style
its
easy
drinking
perhaps
a
touch
too
strong
to
be
a
true
session
beer
this
would
make
for
a
great
ballpark
brew
one
surprise
for
me
however
was
that
while
i
normally
like
most
beers
to
be
on
the
cooler
side
particularly
the
lighter
styles
pepe
nero
continued
to
improve
as
it
approached
room
temperature
releasing
its
full
flavor
profile
and
becoming
significantly
more
complex
o
had
the
2011
version
but
it
s
a
good
take
on
a
farmhouse
ale
im
not
going
to
go
looking
for
things
that
arent
there
so
thats
about
all
i
have
on
this
one
overall
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
but
i
feel
that
the
yeast
is
overbearing
and
hides
the
complex
malt
base
way
too
much
the
brettanomyces
bottle
conditioning
has
really
taken
over
the
beer
since
it
has
been
bottled
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
fresh
before
the
brett
really
has
a
chance
to
overwhelm
the
malt
back
bone
overall
pepe
nero
is
not
your
everyday
saison
or
even
your
every
other
day
saison
but
i
liked
it
well
enough
overall
not
as
complex
as
a
goose
island
sofie
another
saison
but
a
pleasant
experience
i
would
choose
it
again
o
this
is
a
beer
i
really
enjoy
although
it
indicates
it
is
meant
for
aging
i
prefer
it
when
it
is
young
and
a
bit
more
peppery
i
have
a
6
pack
that
i
am
keeping
for
annual
tastings
i
had
my
first
one
after
a
1
year
wait
recently
and
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
ones
ive
had
closer
to
the
bottling
date
nonetheless
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
fairs
over
the
next
few
years
the
flavor
has
some
nutty
tinges
and
light
spice
elements
with
a
mild
toasted
graininess
with
slight
dark
cocoa
astringency
and
mild
almond
type
nutty
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
saison
onf
the
dark
persuasion
goose
island
makes
a
flavorful
belgian
style
and
this
is
no
exception
o
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
something
that
ill
be
hunting
down
again
any
time
soon
id
try
it
on
tap
fresh
if
given
the
chance
but
im
not
going
to
be
buying
a
nearly
2yearold
bottle
again
any
time
soon

notes

the
beer
pours
black
with
dark
brown
edges
the
head
is
tan
and
puffs
up
nicely
before
dissipating
to
nearly
nothing
the
aroma
is
cola
chocolate
roasted
malt
pepper
and
bananas
theres
very
little
saison
yeastiness
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
particularly
compelling
it
smells
a
bit
like
a
bland
saison
mixed
with
a
stout
the
taste
is
relatively
sweet
theres
more
pepper
and
cocoa
the
cola
flavor
creeps
up
a
bit
much
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
its
a
bit
effervescent
but
tends
to
sit
rather
heavily
on
the
palate
for
a
saison
o
delicious
beer
but
difficult
to
tell
it
is
a
saison
at
first
it
is
a
mellow
one
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
for
someone
who
leans
toward
the
stout
or
porter
style
o
its
different
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
i
find
it
a
stretch
to
call
this
one
a
saison
or
farmhouse
beer
but
it
is
interesting
worth
buying
a
single
to
try
m
its
actually
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
heavy
carbonation
detracts
a
lot
i
feel
this
is
a
brew
best
served
fresh
without
two
years
on
the
shelf
cant
recommended
but
just
barely
its
to
bland
and
unremarkable
overall
an
interesting
schizophrenia
of
styles
can
see
how
this
would
be
amenable
to
aging
price
was
okay
at
104
overall
drinkability
id
had
this
before
but
never
reviewed
it
not
quite
as
good
as
a
remember
but
it
gets
the
job
done
as
a
novelty
overall
well
nothing
i
really
cared
a
whole
lot
about
for
the
price
that
you
pay
the
tastes
were
a
little
confused
with
none
of
the
flavors
really
melding
well
together
the
nose
appearance
and
mouthfeel
for
me
were
all
just
average
as
well
it
may
be
worth
a
try
but
this
is
one
i
will
likely
not
go
back
too
there
are
only
a
few
dark
saisons
i
really
like
and
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
one
of
them
like
many
in
the
style
a
bit
too
muddled
with
the
light
roastiness
taking
away
from
the
slightly
funky
crispness
of
the
saison
not
enough
saison
character
and
what
there
is
cant
stand
up
to
the
darker
style
pretty
enough
though
pitch
clack
with
a
nice
creamy
head
very
slight
funk
and
spice
in
the
nose
less
on
the
palate
clean
but
too
much
so
drinkable
but
fairly
boring
o
i
like
me
some
pepe
nero
i
could
only
drink
2
or3
of
these
in
one
night
but
i
think
its
a
great
beer
to
try
to
throw
off
your
taste
buds
i
need
to
try
one
with
a
steak
overall
belgiums
are
always
a
lively
beer
with
all
the
bubbles
and
typically
higher
abv
and
this
one
fits
that
bill
nice
flavor
robust
yeast
and
malt
and
fruitinessvery
drinkabletons
of
carbonation
and
fluff
help
make
this
a
wonderful
drinking
experiencelets
hope
this
one
isnt
affected
by
the
sale
of
the
brewery
and
remains
a
chicago
classicgonna
have
to
find
one
of
these
for
the
cellarhighly
recommended
for
your
consumption45
o
not
a
very
exciting
beer
some
good
flavors
but
theyre
all
overlaying
each
other
i
kind
of
wish
they
had
figured
out
what
they
were
going
for
before
making
the
beer
decent
but
definitely
not
noteworthy
which
style
is
it
really
lets
forget
about
styles
for
a
moment
and
just
enjoy
this
beer
o
a
decent
saison
nice
belgian
fruit

works
well
with
the
chocolaty
and
toasty

it

for
such
an

saison
but
it
did
not
compare
to
the
norm
such
as
the
sofie
i
have
had
this
beer
numerous
times
at
tasting
but
finally
decided
to
review
a
bottle
of
it
it
is
a
unique
saison
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
or
if
you
like
smoked
beers
and
are
looking
for
a
good
afternoon
thirstquencher
bottled
on
122811
overall
a
pretty
nice
black
saison
ill
buy
this
again
in
the
future
pepe
nero
is
a
solid
overall
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
am
often
not
a
fan
of
adding
roasted
malts
to
beer
that
typically
do
not
contain
any
but
in
this
case
it
seemed
to
work
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
very
spicy
and
nicely
warming
aroma
the
peppercorns
as
advertised
were
present
with
all
the
musk
and
sweetness
one
could
ask
from
a
belgian
saison
the
flavoring
also
showed
a
surprising
complexity
with
a
significant
char
to
an
otherwise
toasty
and
fruity
beer
the
peppercorns
were
present
in
the
flavoring
as
well
but
did
take
a
backseat
to
the
malts
on
several
occasions
and
much
of
the
expected
heat
of
spice
was
lacking
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
spices
slight
peppery
aromas
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
and
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
a
very
unique
beer
cant
believe
i
waited
this
long
to
try
one
the
pour
is
nearly
jet
black
inky
and
thick
with
a
really
nice
off
white
head
patchy
but
sturdy
lasting
and
easy
ro
revive
with
a
little
jolt
the
nose
is
really
roasty
malts
with
some
bitter
dark
cocoa
in
there
also
the
black
peppercorns
really
stand
out
as
complimented
by
the
funky
yeast
the
flavor
is
consistent
here
pepper
and
funk
all
the
way
through
with
an
alcoholic
almost
bourbon
flavor
on
the
back
end
spicy
but
not
overbearing
at
all
delicate
in
way
despite
its
looks
the
feel
is
legendary
expansive
bright
mouthfeel
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
like
champaigne
with
some
mellow
warmth
from
the
pepper
and
a
long
lasting
bittersweet
finish
where
the
yeast
still
shines
its
so
complex
and
tasty
im
a
huge
fan
my
bottle
is
from
2012
and
says
6
4
abv
rather
than
the
listed
6
but
you
cant
taste
it
at
all
big
flavors
abound
in
this
drinkable
classic
hoping
the
sale
of
the
brewery
doesnt
shut
this
baby
down
because
this
is
fantastic
personally
3
5
i
dont
say
this
often
but
the
alcohol
could
have
been
stronger
here
beers
like
this
shouldnt
border
on
the
level
of
a
session
but
this
came
relatively
close
a
hint
of
fermented
apricot
and
dark
fruit
remained
in
the
aftertaste
but
there
was
too
much
to
this
that
just
didnt
stick
with
me
while
this
wasnt
bad
it
was
too
underwhelming
and
hopefully
just
a
stepping
stone
for
goose
island
o
this
is
a
flavor
packed
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
i
am
not
the
biggest
saison
fan
but
this
was
a
solid
beer
o
my
first
of
their
vintage
line
and
while
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
was
plenty
satisfied
with
just
the
single
i
picked
up
o
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
gi
on
this
one
the
nose
is
pretty
good
but
the
taste
just
isnt
there
for
me
for
such
a
dark
saison
i
was
expecting
to
be
hit
with
some
stronger
pepper
notes
or
at
least
something
that
would
make
me
say
wow
not
to
be
found
here
and
i
dont
think
id
buy
another
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
more
it
starts
out
really
good
but
becomes
kind
of
boring
halfway
through
not
terrible
by
any
means
but
just
not
incredible
final
thoughts
believe
it
or
not
this
is
this
is
the
first
belgian
style
ale
ive
had
ever
im
glad
i
waited
long
enough
to
understand
the
complexities
of
the
style
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
vintage
bottle
while
im
sure
its
not
the
best
one
out
there
if
this
is
any
indication
of
the
style
then
i
think
im
about
to
start
a
whole
new
craft
beer
journey
into
the
realm
of
belgian
beers
would
i
drink
it
again
im
definitely
going
to
be
cellaring
this
years
release
d
a
very
interesting
beer
here
from
goose
island
loaded
with
character
charm
depth
and
complexities
while
this
isnt
something
i
would
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
its
something
that
ill
gladly
seek
out
again
when
the
mood
hits
an
adventurous
offering
that
was
very
well
received
by
this
ba
bottled
121811
and
consumed
102812
pours
opaque
black
with
34
inch
tan
head
that
dissipates
nose
is
belgian
funk
and
some
rye
nice
but
not
too
interesting
the
flavor
is
not
too
far
off
a
traditional
saison
until
the
finish
where
there
is
a
slight
roasted
quality
and
savory
finish
that
emphasizes
some
rich
caramel
notes
that
go
unnoticed
at
first
the
aftertaste
is
out
of
this
world
just
a
pleasant
complex
finish
which
coats
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
great
nicely
carbonated
to
a
point
where
the
flavors
are
delivered
on
point
also
just
a
tiny
hit
of
spiciness
from
the
rye
or
peppercorns
for
me
almost
comes
across
more
in
the
mouthfeel
than
the
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
not
too
much
to
write
home
about
not
really
outside
of
the
box
enough
from
a
typical
saison
which
the
brewery
releases
would
have
you
expecting
something
far
more
interesting
i
can
imagine
this
beer
would
be
stellar
with
some
good
bbq
or
a
grilled
steak
o
this
is
a
really
interesting
saison
dark
and
moderately
roastytoasty
definitely
mellow
rich
and
malty
spiciness
is
really
nice
too
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
only
thing
i
can
say
against
it
is
that
its
rather
simple
not
a
very
faithful
version
of
the
style
either
but
a
unique
and
delicious
one
instead
d
im
a
big
fan
of
saisons
so
i
wasnt
so
sure
about
this
one
at
first
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
style
however
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
overall
this
is
the
most
unusual
saison
ive
had
to
date
and
i
have
some
mixed
feelings
about
it
the
flavor
is
certainly
a
saison
but
with
some
doppelbock
characteristics
even
though
this
isnt
an
outstanding
saison
its
still
very
drinkable
albeit
a
bit
overpriced
for
what
i
paid
for
it
bottle
from
2011
pour
is
dark
brown
letting
no
light
through
with
tons
of
tight
light
brown
head
nose
is
a
balanced
light
smokey
note
with
a
sweet
saison
yeast
candied
lemon
and
peppery
spice
behind
the
taste
is
far
more
smokey
the
body
is
oily
and
falls
off
in
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
short
the
roast
dominates
but
sweet
lemon
and
faint
saison
yeast
come
in
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
as
roasted
malts
come
in
at
the
end
and
disappear
o
a
nice
take
on
a
classic
style
certainly
interesting
with
the
dark
roasted
qualities
providing
another
dimension
on
a
fairly
simple
style
of
beer
a
nice
easy
drinker
too
certainly
not
your
typical
saison
with
the
toasted
malt
aspects
that
lend
to
its
appearance
but
this
is
tasty
nonetheless
and
i
can
certainly
appreciate
what
the
brewer
was
aiming
for
o
a
beer
everyone
who
loves
this
style
should
try
it
is
an
interesting
take
and
i
personally
feel
the
mouth
feel
makes
this
one
worth
the
price
cheers
overall
its
a
tasty
wellbalanced
brew
it
is
unique
enough
sweet
slightly
tart
and
spicy
its
a
nice
beer
pour
carefully
as
it
really
foams
up
enjoy
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
there
isnt
a
lot
of
challenge
here
but
it
works
well
as
a
midweek
sipper
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
had
from
12
oz
bottle
2012
at
brasserie
in
easton
md
aroma
is
of
slight
pepper
and
belgian
farmhouse
funk
an
interesting
dark
brown
to
black
color
and
the
first
time
i
have
seen
a
black
saison
since
trying
de
viento
at
jolly
pumpkin
this
one
goes
in
a
different
direction
though
aroma
has
funky
yeast
and
roasted
grains
with
some
definite
black
pepper
influence
a
light
taste
here
very
refreshing
with
some
slight
roast
and
with
slight
pepper
and
strong
carbonation
it
is
pretty
unique
but
no
flavor
stands
out
entirely
goes
down
easy
and
is
almost
refreshing
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
pepe
nero
is
a
brownblack
ale
with
huge
brown
foam
on
top
the
aroma
has
notes
of
stone
fruit
plum
wine
soft
toasted
grain
alcohol
and
chocolate
its
pretty
full
bodied
it
turns
dry
very
quickly
and
vanishes
upon
the
swallow
leaving
the
teeth
a
little
chalky
nice
dark
resiny
tones
mingle
staying
fruity
but
never
veering
into
sweetness
theres
a
touch
of
phenol
after
the
swallow
a
tangy
aftertaste
follows
this
is
just
a
very
tasty
ale
i
chugged
it
at
room
temperature
after
letting
it
sit
in
a
glass
for
a
few
hours
overall
i
was
afraid
to
try
this
but
it
really
works
id
get
this
again
well
done
poured
a
large
4
cappucino
head
with
decent
lifespan
the
body
is
dark
as
coffee
it
smells
mildly
of
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
the
taste
matches
the
smell
but
also
adds
coffee
and
the
slightest
touch
of
sour
the
finish
has
a
nice
slow
burn
building
from
the
sour
dark
yet
a
true
saisson
easy
to
drink
nice
beer
a
decent
dark
saison
that
comes
off
as
balanced
but
maybe
a
little
too
astringent
with
the
roasted
malts
the
strong
classic
saison
yeast
profile
is
nice
though
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
has
some
real
strong
points
exquisite
feel
and
moderately
complex
flavors
decant
slowly
at
cool
cellar
temperature
for
best
results
the
beer
pours
like
mahogany
just
as
their
website
claims
with
a
big
beautiful
sandy
white
cream
head
that
leaves
sticky
tendrils
of
foam
along
the
sides
it
sits
in
the
glass
like
a
black
french
roast
coffee
and
is
very
appealing
carbonation
seems
to
be
constant
and
a
little
fierce
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
but
the
head
retention
is
beautiful
the
beer
smells
like
a
saison
sweet
and
biscuity
with
a
nice
yeast
sweet
sour
funk
that
hints
at
citrus
and
pear
as
the
beer
settles
in
the
glass
it
ekes
out
touches
of
toffee
and
roasted
malts
but
nothing
too
pungent
or
noticeable
the
beer
tastes
odd
for
sure
quite
tart
with
the
citrus
saison
kick
the
roasted
malts
and
toffee
dance
at
the
back
of
the
flavor
and
linger
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
as
beautifully
candied
drizzling
the
aftertaste
is
also
strong
with
a
roasty
nutty
coffee
like
fizz
from
the
malts
which
is
lovely
but
bizarre
the
funk
suggests
some
slight
dark
fruits
but
mostly
a
sweet
bready
sour
citrus
the
taste
is
really
quite
bizarre
and
i
am
having
a
hard
time
pinpointing
it
exactly
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
light
and
velvety
and
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
perfect
amount
of
saliva
and
dryness
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
perfect
fit
for
the
cold
winter
months
in
front
of
a
fire
and
is
really
a
bizarre
take
on
the
saison
i
am
very
intrigued
though
i
cant
say
whether
i
actually
liked
it
or
not
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
know
if
its
worth
coming
back
too
onot
a
bad
beer
different
take
on
the
style
than
other
examples
that
i
have
had
i
liked
it
but
could
take
it
or
leave
it
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brownish
black
color
the
head
was
foamy
and
tan
in
color
the
head
settles
slowly
and
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
some
scattered
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
peppery
with
some
sweet
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
soft
breadiness
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
some
very
nice
caramel
notes
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
creamy
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
quite
nice
very
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
having
my
next
bottle
o
hopefully
its
better
when
its
newer
if
i
ever
come
by
a
better
example
ill
be
happy
to
try
again
and
amend
overall
this
is
just
a
yeasty
phenolic
mess
that
i
cannot
get
behind
little
to
know
malt
flavor
and
way
too
much
phenolic
yeast
and
spicy
clove
flavors
i
can
appreciate
a
good
saison
even
a
black
malt
based
one
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
o
overall
a
fine
beer
with
enough
complexity
for
relaxed
appreciation
yet
drinkable
enough
to
quaff
heartily
it
has
almost
nothing
in
common
with
a
saison
not
sure
why
thats
listed
as
the
style
the
label
says
belgian
style
ale
which
is
more
appropriate
im
torn
between
reviewing
this
beer
on
its
merits
and
reviewing
it
as
a
saison
which
the
gi
rep
said
it
was
its
really
a
different
animal
though
more
like
a
lightlyhopped
black
ipa
than
any
saison
ive
had
interesting
decently
tasty
but
not
one
im
likely
to
drink
again
very
nice
and
interesting
beer
d
another
winner
from
gi
really
like
all
these
bottled
conditioned
belgian
styled
brews
cant
really
find
a
dud
in
the
bunch
a
very
unique
saison
i
would
describe
this
more
like
a
belgian
stout
than
saison
the
roasted
malt
detracts
from
any
saison
qualities
o
the
roasty
qualities
of
a
robust
porter
mixed
with
the
spicy
yeastiness
of
a
saison
licorice
cola
cocoa
black
pepper
and
barnyard
very
spicy
and
crisp
a
nice
black
saison
o
great
complexity
and
a
really
interesting
contrast
of
flavors
i
love
the
other
belgian
brews
from
goose
island
pere
jaques
demolition
matilda
sofie
but
im
not
digging
this
one
its
a
hodgepodge
of
unbalanced
tastes
and
the
oxidation
is
so
untypical
for
goose
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
4
pack
and
had
to
give
2
away
definitely
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
support
their
other
brews
with
bombast
d
this
was
a
unique
saison
with
spicy
character
and
darker
malt
nice
scent
and
taste
with
smooth
finish
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
im
curious
how
it
would
be
in
5
years
but
it
was
nice
fresh
not
amazing
pepe
nero
pours
a
very
dark
brown
just
a
shade
of
two
short
of
full
on
black
more
than
three
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
rush
up
to
fill
the
glass
coming
right
up
to
the
lip
before
slowly
edging
back
down
lacing
is
left
in
a
pretty
solid
ring
at
the
top
of
the
glass
but
is
fairly
spotty
below
that
the
nose
features
the
rustic
spiciness
of
rye
moreso
than
the
more
intense
heat
of
the
advertised
peppercorns
the
peppercorns
are
still
pretty
subdued
as
far
as
flavor
goes
again
upstaged
by
the
more
earthy
rye
theres
also
a
big
dry
roasted
chocolate
presence
that
at
best
was
minimal
in
the
nose
its
just
a
bit
too
roasty
for
my
taste
the
body
ends
up
coming
across
as
a
bit
chewy
or
the
style
between
the
chocolaty
flavors
and
the
heaviness
contributed
by
the
rye
carbonation
is
just
ok
showing
a
little
bit
of
energy
theres
a
lot
to
juggle
in
trying
to
pull
off
a
black
peppercorn
rye
saison
and
goose
island
just
doesnt
quite
pull
it
off
with
pepe
nero
o
not
amazing
but
tasty
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
paired
with
a
grilled
peppered
steak
and
arugula
salad
o
a
really
bad
beer
if
they
labeled
this
as
a
dark
belgian
ale
it
would
be
a
very
mediocre
beer
i
was
expecting
a
farmhouse
ale
and
got
a
crappy
stout
not
a
good
introduction
to
goose
island
overall
a
nice
slow
sipping
beer
that
has
a
nice
flavor
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
o
pepe
nero
is
a
really
good
beer
with
a
great
mix
of
roast
maltiness
pepper
and
light
fruity
tones
good
job
gi
this
was
a
miss
for
me
my
least
favorite
offering
from
gi
if
this
is
trying
to
be
a
dark
saison
it
was
a
little
too
much
dark
and
not
enough
saison
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
an
interesting
beer
but
it
just
didnt
come
together
that
well
for
me
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
very
complimentary
to
me
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
on
that
stands
out
in
the
style
for
me
either
originally
reviewed
06092011
pours
seal
brown
with
the
faintest
of
caramel
highlights
along
with
an
ample
khaki
head
that
gradually
simmers
down
before
reaching
a
respectable
equilibrium
this
looks
nothing
like
any
saison
ive
seen
before
the
aroma
is
more
typical
of
the
style
howeverfresh
and
invigorating
with
coriander
citrus
pepper
and
some
crisp
hop
notes
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
with
regards
to
flavor
is
how
supremely
well
balanced
this
beer
is
as
you
first
imbibe
individual
elements
are
difficult
discern
but
you
can
tell
theyre
quality
smooth
roasted
malt
and
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
ride
a
wave
of
prickly
carbonation
pepper
is
discernbile
as
well
once
the
first
wave
has
subsided
which
should
come
as
no
surprise
considering
its
the
only
ingredient
goose
island
took
the
time
to
mention
on
the
label
i
think
im
also
catching
some
apple
peel
in
there
somewhere
as
well
the
kicker
for
me
though
is
the
hint
of
smoky
bitter
chocolate
that
creeps
in
on
the
back
endnow
thats
a
sophisticated
finish
this
looks
nothing
like
your
typical
saison
and
the
aroma
does
not
match
the
appearance
at
all
but
none
of
that
matters
when
it
comes
to
sheer
enjoyment
theres
something
here
for
everyone
from
chocolate
malt
to
zesty
spice
all
expertly
balanced
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
among
a
stellar
lineup
from
the
adept
team
at
goose
island
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
if
you
only
drink
half
a
bottle
good
flavors
but
the
dark
malt
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
other
flavors
and
it
starts
to
get
a
bit
offputting
b
a
nice
loud
hiss
once
the
cap
pops
the
liquid
is
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
color
from
a
far
but
up
towards
light
it
still
appears
dark
brown
looks
like
a
baltic
porter
or
perhaps
a
quad
without
carbonation
as
the
skim
is
minimal
with
a
dark
tan
hue
no
stick
on
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
pleasant
with
some
dark
saison
qualities
dark
wheat
with
some
live
belgian
yeast
giving
bread
some
clove
while
the
peppercorns
come
with
warming
this
saison
is
something
different
it
has
a
wheat
quality
while
displaying
some
dubbel
characteristics
some
cherry
with
wheat
going
into
a
light
bready
yeast
taste
mixing
in
with
a
faint
malting
nuts
in
the
background
with
light
peppercorn
flavor
different
for
the
style
and
very
tasty
stuff
feel
is
less
than
medium
with
low
carb
so
not
much
bite
on
the
mouth
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
as
pie
i
thinks
this
would
pair
well
with
some
cured
meats
and
light
cheese
i
like
this
stuff
a
bomber
was
simple
to
finish
while
pepe
nero
reminds
me
of
some
of
stillwater
dark
saisons
overall
clearly
not
a
favorite
this
is
not
a
traditional
saison
at
least
not
the
way
i
think
of
them
although
that
could
be
my
lack
of
experience
speaking
i
wish
there
were
a
belgian
porter
category
to
me
that
would
make
a
lot
more
sense
for
this
one
had
this
before
but
tried
again
at
a
world
wines
and
liquor
tasting
pours
dark
reddish
brown
into
a
plastic
4
0z
cup
medium
carbonated
head
aroma
is
rich
with
spices
pepper
belgian
yeast
dark
fruit
taste
is
fairly
sweet
up
front
with
loads
of
pepper
present
some
bitterness
fairly
quick
finish
light
to
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
nice
simple
but
solid
brew
overall
goose
island
makes
some
great
belgian
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
there
were
a
few
points
where
i
felt
this
brew
got
a
little
busy
and
started
to
take
away
from
the
enjoyment
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
here
and
its
hard
to
get
you
tongue
into
every
nook
and
cranny
still
this
is
more
proof
that
the
ladies
and
gents
from
chicago
are
still
putting
out
some
good
beer
overall
having
had
this
back
to
back
with
matilda
i
actually
would
choose
this
one
to
have
again
because
of
how
different
it
was
overall
not
a
badtasting
brew
but
not
terribly
interesting
either
o
pretty
good
and
an
interesting
beer
but
not
really
my
thing
seems
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
not
in
a
hurry
to
try
more
of
this
o
this
has
so
many
of
the
right
elements
going
for
it
i
just
wish
it
were
a
bit
fullerbodied
and
lasted
a
bit
longer
without
turning
watery
overall
i
was
quiet
impressed
with
the
beer
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
dark
saison
but
i
thought
it
was
very
interesting
and
worked
well
taste
is
caramel
roasted
malt
and
spicy
it
really
is
not
characteristic
of
this
style
but
it
tastes
ok
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
good
but
alcohol
was
surprisingly
warming
considering
it
was
only
6
it
seems
to
taste
more
like
a
saison
as
it
airs
out
and
warms
up
might
come
back
and
update
after
i
drink
all
four
of
these
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
roast
and
small
caramel
notes
in
the
taste
small
caramel
notes
roasty
and
small
dryer
notes
in
the
end
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthful
with
a
small
dry
roast
and
somewhat
light
oatmeal
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
not
so
much
belgian
and
more
stout
like
plenty
of
carbonation
to
hold
the
head
and
a
nice
lighter
body
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
though
not
quite
session
able
i
still
like
it
though
not
a
bad
beer
leaves
a
little
bit
unsatisfying
however
like
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
umph
on
the
malt
bill
the
caramel
just
didnt
quite
cut
it
with
enough
flavor
upfront
to
balance
it
out
definitely
would
not
have
hurt
to
have
a
bit
more
of
an
herbal
earthiness
or
spiciness
as
well
would
definitely
also
benefit
with
a
bit
more
age
i
think
this
one
is
about
only
about
four
months
old
and
may
become
more
complex
with
a
bit
more
time
d
not
sure
it
is
really
a
saison
more
a
light
interesting
baltic
porter
or
a
very
strongly
characterful
schwarzbier
rather
minimal
on
the
peppery
earthy
yeast
notes
that
usually
mark
a
saison
even
with
peppercorns
added
and
a
bit
lacking
in
the
usual
attenuation
and
dryness
no
funk
of
any
kind
whatever
style
bucket
it
fits
in
it
is
one
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
pours
a
very
dark
red
amber
almost
black
medium
tan
1
finger
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
dark
and
roasted
malt
light
citrus
taste
is
dry
rye
dark
and
roasted
malts
up
front
finishes
dry
with
a
peppery
aftertaste
a
smokey
flavor
also
present
in
the
finish
unusual
flavors
and
interesting
ale
my
tastesmell
is
not
perfect
after
a
flu
so
this
is
worth
a
retry
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
but
still
intriguing
not
sure
on
this
one
do
i
like
yes
good
beer
just
dont
know
how
to
classify
dark
belgian
maybe
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
belgian
style
beer
very
well
crafted
here
in
us
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
watery
nature
of
this
one
held
it
back
some
it
sure
looks
and
smells
as
good
as
any
beer
ive
ever
sampled
though
doa
o
overall
a
good
saison
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
pepper
adds
something
interesting
i
would
have
this
again
but
not
seek
it
out
overall
one
year
is
probably
perfect
for
aging
and
yields
some
nicely
mellowed
and
complex
flavors
o
very
interesting
ale
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
quite
good
o
outstanding
beer
great
refreshing
complex
taste
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
asap
o
odd
and
interesting
good
but
not
great
dont
know
how
i
truly
feel
about
it
its
a
very
complex
flavor
light
and
billowy
on
the
tongue
it
has
an
aerated
feel
while
bringing
to
the
front
plum
pepper
chocolate
malt
in
the
middle
and
a
finish
of
cloves
and
white
peppercorn
delicious
maybe
its
running
home
in
the
rain
coming
in
soaked
and
grabbing
this
out
of
the
cellar
but
its
really
hitting
the
spot
and
i
can
see
enjoying
it
regularly
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
and
unique
saison
i
knew
as
soon
as
i
poured
this
into
the
glass
that
this
wasnt
your
average
saison
the
dark
color
threw
me
off
at
first
but
as
soon
as
i
smelled
it
i
knew
it
was
still
a
saison
this
beer
has
pretty
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
it
also
went
very
nice
with
the
flank
steak
i
had
for
dinner
one
of
the
best
dinner
beer
pairings
i
have
had
so
far
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
i
especially
liked
the
added
complexity
that
the
roasted
malts
imparted
that
made
for
a
saison
that
was
unlike
any
i
have
had
before
there
wasnt
anything
that
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
barnyard
funk
but
with
this
beer
i
wouldnt
have
mind
a
little
more
which
is
very
unusual
for
me
and
i
think
that
given
a
couple
more
years
in
the
cellar
that
the
funk
would
be
a
little
more
prominent
so
i
would
like
to
try
one
with
a
couple
more
years
on
it
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
to
switch
things
up
a
little
it
is
a
little
pricey
but
i
think
that
this
beer
is
worth
the
price
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
the
roasted
malts
make
this
beer
quite
different
from
your
average
saison
i
am
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
brew
and
i
am
pretty
surprised
and
impressed
with
how
well
this
beer
turned
out
who
would
have
thought
that
roasted
malts
would
work
well
in
a
saison
but
they
do
maybe
more
brewers
will
experiment
with
dark
saisons
i
am
starting
to
think
i
should
give
this
brewery
more
credit
they
can
make
some
solid
belgian
inspired
beers
and
i
liked
the
added
creativity
in
this
beer
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
had
golden
cap
is
still
my
favorite
traditional
one
but
when
it
comes
to
nontraditional
saisons
this
beer
takes
the
cake
good
work
guys
easy
blend
full
of
flavor
kick
at
the
end
real
good
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
ccb
tasting
snifter
the
pour
is
jet
black
big
white
head
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
kinda
bleh
some
fruits
peppercorns
there
are
some
fruity
esters
on
tasting
peppercorns
dark
fruit
the
finish
lingers
with
some
sweetness
the
body
is
light
good
carbonation
a
decent
belgian
style
ale
but
not
a
saison
alright
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
gives
a
big
rocky
offwhite
head
that
just
sits
on
top
of
a
deep
coke
brown
color
showing
moderate
retention
the
nose
is
very
sweet
with
raisins
light
caramel
yeast
figs
and
a
cocacola
like
scent
dont
get
a
lot
of
peppercorn
in
the
nose
but
its
there
and
a
good
swirl
helps
the
taste
is
of
yeast
clove
toasted
malt
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
and
spiciness
from
the
pepper
is
present
in
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
charred
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
just
under
medium
with
a
very
fizzy
carbonation
and
is
easy
to
drink
overall
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
but
i
enjoy
more
of
a
crisp
farmhouse
brew
with
some
bitterness
that
is
much
less
sweet
and
finishes
much
more
dry
and
refreshing
this
is
really
not
a
saison
and
i
dont
just
say
that
because
of
the
color
the
balance
between
fruits
spice
and
bitterness
is
just
not
right
although
this
isnt
the
best
of
style
it
could
still
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
while
not
confining
to
the
typical
brews
just
not
my
favorite
thanks
for
the
opportunity
d
overall
a
wonder
beer
very
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
amazing
cocoa
head
good
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
way
darker
than
i
was
expecting
for
this
style
of
beer
but
oh
well
the
nose
is
yeast
malt
peppercorn
and
wheat
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
still
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
a
little
surprising
it
changes
by
the
millisecond
same
profile
as
the
nose
but
it
goes
from
sharp
bite
to
malt
creaminess
barnyard
funk
and
almost
a
hefeweizen
type
finish
overall
a
good
beer
that
has
a
few
flaws
keeping
it
from
greatness
cheers
overall
a
very
drinkable
twist
on
a
standard
saison
the
roasted
characteristics
make
it
a
nice
alternative
for
the
winter
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
anything
too
thick
o
i
loved
this
what
a
great
idea
really
kept
the
surprises
coming
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
plan
to
age
a
few
on
the
palate
the
pepe
nero
is
just
as
complex
and
equally
as
subtle
very
soft
hints
of
malty
sweets
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
chocolate
here
and
there
and
just
a
touch
of
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
let
the
pepe
warm
completely
to
room
temperature
before
finishing
and
the
pepe
only
gets
better
somewhere
between
a
big
belgian
quad
and
a
softer
style
stout
the
pepe
nero
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
i
can
hardly
wait
till
the
goose
island
beers
are
available
regularly
here
in
ct
overall
this
turned
out
to
be
a
great
pick
up
i
had
one
of
these
in
my
hotel
room
while
i
was
still
in
chicago
and
was
extremely
disappointed
maybe
it
was
the
small
dixie
cup
sized
glass
i
used
i
dont
know
but
this
beer
was
alot
better
this
time
around
very
aromatic
and
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
im
glad
i
have
2
more
of
these
to
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
beer
from
a
great
midwestern
brewery
i
am
a
big
fan
of
gi
so
i
am
predisposed
to
liking
this
there
is
no
reason
to
not
try
this
good
stuff
d
okay
a
bit
flat
a
bit
dry
not
a
very
full
flavored
saison
d
really
a
disappointing
brew
overall
boring
and
scattered
id
pass
on
this
in
the
future
c
an
interesting
twist
on
the
saison
i
love
saisons
but
the
peppercorns
are
just
too
weird
for
me
i
would
much
rather
prefer
a
traditional
saison
like
the
bite
of
the
rye
though
i
think
goose
island
in
general
hit
what
they
were
going
for
drink
is
quite
good
nice
job
gi
a
very
odd
and
quite
likeable
beer
o
like
i
said
in
taste
this
isnt
bad
but
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
id
like
to
try
another
black
saison
or
two
for
proper
perspective
and
revisit
this
review
o
a
unique
saison
thats
pretty
decent
the
roasted
malt
and
saison
characters
dont
meld
extremely
well
but
they
dont
really
clash
either
o
worth
trying
once
would
i
buy
it
again
i
doubt
it
surprised
that
it
made
the
draft
top
25
of
2011
list
but
also
this
could
an
introduction
of
the
newest
style
black
saison
o
an
enjoyable
interpretation
of
a
belgian
although
i
do
prefer
unibroues
offerings
odarker
than
i
expected
for
a
saison
but
still
tasty
they
say
you
can
age
it
for
up
to
five
years
and
now
im
kinda
curious
what
that
would
end
up
like
serving
type
bottle
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
saison
with
the
most
noticeable
difference
being
the
dark
characteristics
it
is
ok
but
a
bit
overpriced
in
my
opinion
bottle
poured
a
black
color
ale
with
a
medium
brown
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
spicy
yeast
notes
with
some
belgian
malt
with
light
notes
of
spices
taste
is
an
interesting
mix
between
some
solid
belgian
rustic
malt
notes
with
some
peppery
notes
and
some
spicy
yeast
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
solid
offering
with
an
interesting
mix
between
the
rye
malt
and
the
spicy
yeast
strain
o
not
what
id
expect
from
goose
island
for
balance
and
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
blah
beer
a
few
good
things
going
for
it
but
it
doesnt
come
together
to
make
anything
interesting
o
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
experience
with
the
style
but
it
comes
across
to
me
as
a
fairly
underdeveloped
dubbel
overall
this
was
a
very
unusual
but
quite
well
executed
saison
it
was
decently
complex
and
the
true
flavor
comes
out
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
say
it
is
just
a
tad
flat
flavorwise
in
the
beginning
the
bottle
i
reviewed
was
aged
for
6
months
overall
a
most
interesting
beer
the
flavor
palatte
comes
at
you
from
all
directions
thebeeralmanac
com
overall
a
very
complex
and
interesting
take
on
a
saison
very
tasty
the
flavor
is
closer
to
a
saison
than
the
smell
theres
some
earthiness
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
very
highthe
only
true
distraction
the
swallow
features
the
true
farmhouse
sour
bite
the
beer
doesnt
look
like
a
saison
but
it
surely
tastes
like
it
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
belgian
beer
and
dark
malt
so
this
fit
the
bill
im
not
sure
if
id
go
for
it
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
good
to
go
nothing
weird
just
a
great
drinking
beer
i
freaking
love
this
beer
its
one
of
my
new
favorites
its
earthniess
and
woodiness
work
wonderfully
together
this
beer
is
remarkable
o
meh
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
too
many
flavors
that
i
like
to
see
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
not
mixed
together
i
could
see
how
people
would
like
it
my
girlfriend
likes
it
but
this
just
isnt
my
thing
i
understand
the
gray
areas
and
the
belgian
concept
of
style
and
i
appreciate
it
however
taking
this
approach
to
it
in
this
situation
does
not
work
for
me
tasty
and
enjoyable
this
is
simply
unlike
any
farmhouse
ale
ive
had
before
not
much
spice
or
herbiness
to
it
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
style
porter
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
whatever
label
you
want
to
give
this
though
id
recommend
grabbing
one
warming
it
to
a
comfortable
50
degrees
and
giving
it
a
pour
in
your
favorite
chalice
goblet
or
tulip
glass
overall
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
overall
good
but
a
little
strange
black
saison
it
is
creative
but
im
not
so
sure
the
saison
needs
patent
malt
added
to
it
t
dark
fruit
and
yeast
alongside
roasted
malt
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
and
plum
i
never
picked
up
any
pepper
flavor
and
the
beer
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
a
saison
in
any
way
almost
like
a
quadlite
but
i
like
this
beer
whatever
style
it
may
actually
be
pours
a
black
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
alcohol
yeast
and
darktart
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
alcohol
sweet
malt
yeast
tart
citrus
slight
liquor
and
slight
roasted
malt
overall
a
much
different
saison
than
i
am
used
too
never
had
such
a
dark
roasted
saison
but
it
was
still
really
good
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
enormous
head
on
initial
pour
nose
is
surprisingly
light
with
figs
dark
fruit
and
cocoa
powder
black
pepper
is
all
over
the
palate
especially
once
it
warms
considerably
dark
fruits
again
some
sourness
and
plenty
of
carbonation
surprisingly
light
for
the
dark
appearance
a
pleasant
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
of
anything
to
do
with
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
or
any
belgian
style
in
general
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
the
flavor
though
and
it
gets
a
tad
old
d
overall
not
a
bad
drink
i
think
there
are
a
lot
qualities
that
are
hidden
in
the
beer
that
come
out
after
aging
could
be
a
classic
drink
with
age
at
least
a
few
years
i
think
it
would
definitely
increase
in
flavor
complexity
and
mouthfeel
actually
reminded
me
a
bit
of
bestefar
from
haandbrygeriet
maybe
not
to
style
very
well
but
its
tasty
im
a
fan
o
very
unique
beer
it
has
some
different
flavors
but
they
seem
to
come
together
nicely
i
do
believe
id
enjoy
this
as
a
session
beer
without
a
doubt
if
it
werent
for
the
9
99
4pack
pricetag
i
most
definitely
would
however
the
quality
is
top
notch
and
without
compromise
i
honestly
cannot
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
great
job
goose
island
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
rough
overall
its
an
ok
beer
o
i
wasnt
a
fan
at
first
but
this
has
grown
on
me
a
bit
or
at
least
i
begin
to
recognize
its
merits
as
suggested
on
goose
islands
website
this
is
probably
best
served
with
some
grilled
meat
to
work
with
the
peppery
flavor
certainly
not
your
typical
saison
o
despite
some
misgivings
its
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
its
an
interesting
combination
of
bitter
and
refreshing
i
do
wish
it
had
a
better
balance
and
more
peppercorn
but
its
good
o
this
is
an
impressive
beer
i
like
the
surprise
element
involved
here
a
dark
farmhouse
ale
that
smells
much
brighter
than
it
looks
but
tastes
much
darker
than
it
smells
ive
had
this
with
enchilades
mole
before
and
liked
it
a
lot
i
wouldnt
pair
this
with
any
spicy
meal
it
might
overwhelm
many
thai
dishes
for
instance
but
anything
rich
and
spicy
would
be
perfect
vindaloo
would
be
perfect
ok
yes
great
beer
jh
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
the
smell
is
peppery
with
other
spice
notes
throughout
the
flavor
is
crisp
a
little
roast
character
that
you
dont
expect
in
a
saison
th
flavor
finishes
with
a
nice
peppery
touch
the
carbonation
is
high
and
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
overall
as
stated
much
better
than
i
thought
enjoyed
the
peppercorns
very
drinkable
o
i
came
to
this
beer
with
no
expectations
but
i
did
a
little
research
at
the
brewerys
website
first
a
black
saison
why
not
theres
nothing
to
say
that
you
cant
use
darker
malts
in
beers
that
are
traditionally
pale
it
modifies
the
flavour
sometimes
for
better
sometimes
for
worse
and
this
case
i
think
it
works
it
just
makes
it
a
bit
more
challenging
to
review
because
there
are
no
benchmarks
to
grade
it
against
its
mostly
down
personal
preference
with
something
as
uncommon
as
this
the
body
was
also
about
average
for
the
style
medium
crisp
and
tart
drinkability
was
pretty
good
but
then
i
generally
find
saisons
to
be
very
drinkable
overall
a
nice
beer
im
not
sure
id
grab
another
22
but
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
id
surely
have
a
couple
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
impression
from
the
start
does
not
look
like
anything
like
a
saison
even
the
smell
wasnt
so
great
but
ended
up
being
above
average
would
rather
throw
people
towards
the
g
i
sofie
instead
of
this
one
initially
it
seems
overcarbonated
the
flavors
seem
in
between
a
dunkelweizen
light
malt
flavors
lots
of
wheat
and
a
porter
very
roasty
and
toasty
theres
also
some
funk
in
there
which
the
carbonation
actually
helps
to
even
out
thes
a
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
there
arent
a
lot
of
ibus
here
there
is
an
interesting
dryness
through
the
middle
of
the
mouth
too
i
might
have
said
a
belgianamerican
porter
maybe
thats
why
its
disappointed
so
many
as
a
saison
i
like
it
a
lot
disappointed
in
this
brew
was
surprised
to
see
this
billed
as
a
saison
as
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
spice
flavors
ive
has
with
other
saisons
yeasty
sour
flavor
with
mild
aftertaste
pretty
bland
with
no
depth
o
this
is
almost
like
a
borderline
black
ipa
but
with
weak
hops
and
lots
of
spice
not
my
favourite
mix
of
styles
but
it
was
okay
wouldnt
seek
out
again
o
an
interesting
brew
not
sure
i
would
call
it
a
saison
big
tastes
of
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
crisp
carbonation
makes
it
very
easy
drinking
o
a
nice
saison
different
take
on
the
style
with
the
darker
color
i
would
happily
buy
this
again
o
not
bad
but
not
the
greatest
it
was
cool
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
d
interesting
worth
a
try
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
solid
brew
o
this
beer
is
just
too
confusing
for
my
palate
i
guess
the
mingling
of
too
many
beers
is
what
this
feels
like
and
even
though
it
has
some
pleasant
qualities
it
isnt
very
drinkable
having
goose
islands
pepe
nero
at
sapsuckers
hops
grubs
in
huntington
ny
a
very
good
dark
beer
with
lacing
on
the
creamy
but
thin
head
notes
of
black
pepper
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
the
roasted
malts
black
peppercorns
and
slight
bitterness
that
cleanse
the
palette
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
the
concept
was
better
than
the
execution
ive
had
one
other
black
saison
and
i
loved
it
i
think
it
was
a
collaboration
from
mountain
sun
and
avery
wish
i
could
do
a
sidebyside
oh
well
it
was
an
experience
d
not
my
favorite
but
could
session
o
great
flavor
not
what
you
think
of
with
a
farmhouse
ale
drinkability
is
fairly
high
the
flavor
profile
is
decent
and
with
moderate
abv
it
creates
an
easy
drinking
beer
on
a
side
note
i
dont
see
how
this
even
resembles
a
saisonfarmhouse
edit
as
it
warms
its
a
little
farmhousey
i
dont
know
that
i
love
all
the
roastiness
in
there
though
for
this
type
of
beer
o
i
really
like
this
beer
lots
going
on
perhaps
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
roast
flavor
but
great
otherwise
o
a
great
saison
i
am
going
to
stash
a
few
away
and
see
how
it
changes
id
like
to
get
more
peppercorn
out
of
it
overall
i
purchased
four
of
these
and
each
time
i
have
somewhat
struggled
to
polish
each
one
something
about
the
peppery
and
tobacco
combo
just
doesnt
make
me
enjoy
it
too
much
i
have
one
more
remaining
and
will
probably
cellar
it
for
a
number
of
years
as
the
label
states
it
can
develop
in
the
bottle
for
up
to
5
years
worth
a
shot
o
unlike
any
saison
ive
ever
had
some
of
the
saison
aspects
are
there
but
there
is
a
splash
of
something
darker
as
well
its
good
but
i
think
id
take
a
traditional
saison
over
this
one
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
dark
saison
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
and
not
get
tired
of
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
started
awkward
but
ended
nice
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
perhaps
a
bit
fresher
definitely
a
different
take
on
a
saison
not
as
crazy
as
existent
but
definitely
not
traditional
overall
enjoyable
and
interesting
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
dark
saison
there
were
aspects
that
were
familiar
to
a
regular
saison
yet
there
were
also
aspects
that
were
new
from
the
addition
of
dark
grains
overall
not
a
saison
at
all
but
a
very
good
beer
non
the
less
jd
this
a
really
nice
beer
interesting
taste
pleasant
to
drink
oan
interesting
combination
this
dark
saison
has
decent
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
offputting
will
see
how
it
ages
overall
very
good
saison
crisp
and
refreshing
i
want
to
get
more
of
this
not
as
good
as
sophie
but
pretty
good
should
try
if
you
like
saisons
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
interesting
take
on
saison
ive
never
seen
a
black
saison
like
this
so
i
like
it
dark
brown
body
and
a
23
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foam
a
little
lacing
im
mostly
just
getting
some
toasty
malt
in
the
aroma
the
peppercorns
come
across
nicely
in
the
taste
as
a
very
fresh
green
spiciness
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
its
pretty
much
a
brown
ale
with
peppercorns
d
a
very
interesting
melange
of
styles
and
flavors
one
of
the
best
of
the
recent
hybrid
type
brews
ive
tried
the
other
half
of
this
bottle
will
go
with
the
ribs
i
have
on
the
smoker
as
i
type
this
and
with
some
grilled
vegetables
fresh
from
the
garden
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
it
kind
of
falls
flat
in
the
aftertaste
department
and
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
linger
to
it
this
is
certainly
an
interesting
beverage
and
not
bad
at
all
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
intangibles
of
a
world
class
saison
nonetheless
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
and
probably
fantastic
with
food
o
a
roasty
and
fruity
saison
with
notes
of
smoke
and
pepper
not
my
favorite
interpretation
just
different
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
o
good
beer
very
well
made
just
dont
think
its
the
right
combination
of
flavors
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
the
wad
slowly
recedes
to
some
splotches
and
a
ring
the
beer
is
dark
enough
that
i
cannot
see
through
it
at
all
not
even
to
see
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
molasses
spice
and
a
touch
of
funk
the
taste
starts
clean
and
slightly
sweet
in
the
middle
i
get
a
bit
of
the
lifting
sensation
from
the
carbonation
but
not
as
much
as
i
have
experienced
with
other
saisons
onwards
the
end
of
the
taste
i
get
some
coffeelike
taste
that
i
cant
exactly
place
then
a
clean
finish
this
does
not
match
my
definition
of
a
saison
but
it
is
a
good
beer
nonetheless
drinkability
good
stuff
though
it
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
i
find
myself
enjoying
the
stout
side
more
just
because
i
tend
to
like
that
style
more
overall
this
was
not
a
total
dainpour
but
the
offering
just
didnt
work
for
me
i
appreciate
the
thinkoutsidethebox
approach
but
i
prefer
to
keep
my
porters
and
saisons
separate
i
e
in
the
traditional
fashion
an
easy
drinking
roasty
and
malty
farmhouse
ale
like
nothing
ive
ever
experienced
before
im
glad
i
tried
it
quick
review
pours
super
dark
black
with
minimal
offwhite
head
nose
is
packed
with
classic
dubbel
notes
fruity
and
figgy
palate
is
smooth
and
wide
with
lots
of
roasted
flavors
but
a
clean
texture
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
export
stout
peppercorns
dont
make
a
huge
impression
sad
to
say
drinkability
isnt
half
bad
neither
the
aroma
or
taste
are
truly
powerful
and
the
latter
isnt
balanced
enough
from
the
dominant
bread
notes
otherwise
this
brew
surprised
me
lightly
roasted
malts
and
coffee
up
front
some
nuttiness
along
with
some
tannic
woodiness
lightly
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
licorice
midpalate
yeasty
slightly
fruity
notes
lurk
more
roasted
coffee
bitterness
in
the
finish
along
with
some
spicy
peppery
earthy
notes
develops
more
complexity
as
it
warms
moderate
body
with
a
bubbly
effervescent
feel
an
interesting
beer
would
be
nice
to
see
how
this
ages
i
e
some
sour
notes
would
be
cool
i
did
try
this
bottled
and
it
was
incredibly
not
as
good
44333
medium
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
for
the
style
overall
not
bad
nothing
that
stands
out
as
amazing
to
me
poured
from
12oz
bottle
2011
though
i
wish
i
let
it
age
a
little
longer
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
belgian
yeast
with
banana
and
clove
but
also
has
some
black
pepper
bunt
rye
toast
and
a
dash
of
funky
citrus
the
flavor
has
a
lot
less
potency
than
the
aroma
but
did
pick
up
sweet
malt
roastiness
pepper
and
belgian
candi
sweetness
becomes
toasty
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
soap
on
the
finish
light
on
the
palate
with
a
small
amount
of
frothy
carbonation
throughout
did
not
meet
my
expectations
one
of
the
best
beers
to
drink
with
meat
especially
bbq
pork
i
have
had
this
beer
on
several
occasions
and
it
is
a
wonderful
black
saison
with
traditional
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
but
has
a
smokeyblack
pepper
finish
the
smokey
peppery
finishes
really
compliments
meats
very
well
truly
a
great
beer
good
on
its
own
but
really
compliments
food
nicely
one
of
many
goose
island
beers
that
really
is
made
for
dining
i
dont
like
this
beer
as
a
saison
and
i
dont
like
it
on
its
own
this
is
my
second
black
saison
and
if
i
dont
see
another
thats
just
dandy
malty
dark
and
roasty
not
getting
much
if
any
traditional
saison
characteristics
maybe
some
light
pepper
in
the
finish
eh
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
others
said
stout
o
while
this
is
begging
for
a
new
style
tick
black
farmhouse
ale
whos
with
me
its
unremarkable
in
execution
its
tasty
roasty
toasty
chewy
gooeyand
its
good
beer
and
you
can
drink
it
thats
a
good
one
two
combo
let
me
assure
you
all
beers
should
have
that
o
i
really
really
like
this
beer
normally
im
a
little
overwhelmed
by
farmhouse
ales
i
like
them
but
cant
drink
them
all
night
this
beer
feels
a
bit
lighter
to
me
the
peppercorn
is
not
very
evident
other
than
color
the
black
peppercorns
didnt
seem
to
add
much
to
this
interpretation
of
a
farmhouse
ale
but
it
still
succeeds
as
a
flavorful
drinkable
brew
hops
pilgrim
saaz
overall
interesting
and
pretty
good
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
unique
beers
ive
had
at
this
abv
level
probably
not
something
id
want
to
have
all
the
time
but
id
get
it
again
as
a
saison
its
nothing
amazing
but
as
a
unique
stylebending
beer
its
nice
an
interesting
beer
but
at
least
for
me
i
dont
think
the
rye
flavor
goes
all
that
well
with
the
saison
style
o
this
beer
is
very
interesting
because
the
peppercorns
make
it
taste
almost
like
a
black
saison
if
there
is
such
a
style
the
pepper
is
not
overpowering
but
it
does
mask
some
of
the
other
flavors
that
you
would
typically
expect
from
a
saison
overall
i
strongly
disliked
this
beer
and
would
probably
argue
that
a
dark
saison
is
a
mistake
o
this
is
a
very
dark
saison
i
have
not
experienced
many
but
stays
pretty
true
to
the
style
easy
drinking
and
the
bottle
says
will
develop
in
the
bottle
for
5
years
i
wonder
what
this
would
taste
like
then
the
taste
has
malt
and
some
peppercorns
that
dont
play
as
integral
a
roll
as
i
would
have
expected
i
get
simple
heavily
toasted
and
medium
roasted
bread
grains
with
white
peppercorns
pretty
pleasant
and
enjoyable
brew
nothing
extravagant
but
something
i
would
buy
again
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
this
popular
style
the
peppercorn
and
dark
malts
go
with
the
saison
yeast
very
well
i
can
see
homebrewing
something
like
this
in
the
near
future
pours
a
dark
bown
with
mahogany
highlights
decent
cap
of
bubbly
khaki
head
decent
lacing
scent
contains
notes
of
dark
yeasty
bread
carmelized
sugars
touch
of
roast
with
dark
fruit
and
peppery
spice
taste
follows
scent
but
with
a
musty
and
earthyness
a
saisonfarmhous
i
see
medium
bodied
quite
bubbly
and
prickly
a
nice
beer
which
benefits
from
the
darker
malts
and
the
earthyness
brought
about
from
the
yeasts
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
creamierfuller
than
expected
with
some
tight
carbonation
up
front
that
fades
toward
the
end
of
the
swallow
the
spicypeppery
presence
from
the
aroma
is
very
powerful
and
dominates
the
flavor
lingering
throughout
into
a
spicy
dry
finish
in
addition
to
black
pepper
im
picking
up
some
chilies
that
give
the
beer
some
heat
in
the
finish
its
also
slightly
earthy
and
funky
but
not
as
much
as
the
aroma
suggests
a
good
balance
of
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
spice
hints
of
roasted
chocolate
toast
grape
fig
raisin
and
plum
slightly
sweet
and
vinous
but
the
dark
malt
notes
and
spicy
peppers
even
things
out
it
could
be
to
heavy
on
the
spice
for
some
but
i
enjoyed
it
overall
really
interesting
pretty
good
nice
saison
flavors
blended
with
a
bit
of
darker
malts
touch
of
cocoa
and
some
creamy
malts
bit
of
funk
and
tartness
and
fruits
nice
o
cant
remember
a
dark
saison
ive
had
befroe
this
definitely
worth
trying
again
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
your
typical
saison
peppery
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
roasted
character
and
belgian
yeast
spiciness
its
quite
dry
and
earthy
with
a
pretty
solid
belgian
yeast
nose
the
taste
is
outstanding
it
has
such
a
complex
array
of
flavors
it
has
a
really
nice
roastedchocolate
malt
character
that
does
mute
some
of
the
traditional
saison
character
but
it
also
seems
to
enhance
the
experience
it
still
packs
in
a
serious
amount
of
esters
as
well
as
a
bone
dry
finish
the
blackness
really
adds
a
layer
of
depth
that
contributes
to
a
more
well
rounded
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
this
style
but
i
sure
do
enjoy
this
one
o
very
easy
to
drink
with
lots
of
flavor
i
would
buy
this
for
a
treat
if
i
find
it
again
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
roasted
a
little
bit
pepper
and
plenty
of
standard
issue
saison
slightly
woody
with
lemongrass
and
earth
notes
the
roast
is
well
restrained
but
noticeable
sweetness
never
drops
in
and
bitterness
is
the
order
of
the
day
dry
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
goose
island
is
a
brewery
that
rather
than
embrace
traditional
style
guidelines
they
hold
them
at
arms
length
pepe
nero
is
a
very
unique
creation
that
has
elements
of
a
belgian
saison
a
german
roggenbier
and
also
the
other
few
north
american
ales
ive
had
that
were
brewed
with
peppercorns
labeling
it
any
style
is
out
of
context
its
an
exceptionally
wellcrafted
ingeniously
thought
out
and
delightfully
drinkable
ale
thats
all
there
is
to
it
o
this
has
good
drinkability
i
was
a
little
worried
about
this
when
i
saw
how
dark
it
was
but
it
proved
to
be
nice
and
refreshing
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
saison
and
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
not
bad
but
id
prefer
a
normal
saison
over
this
interesting
enough
though
hops
pilgrim
saaz
o
just
a
really
good
beer
its
at
its
best
over
60f
for
sure
no
matter
what
is
going
on
with
gi
and
ab
theres
no
denying
this
is
well
made
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
black
saison
like
mine
but
less
funky
good
stuff
thanks
rob
overall
a
beer
that
from
first
impressions
seems
like
a
winner
however
with
each
sip
my
mouth
grows
more
tired
of
the
heavyhanded
pepper
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
such
beers
very
dark
for
a
saison
molases
brown
with
a
smokey
head
notes
of
yeast
a
little
fruit
a
little
bit
of
pepper
brown
sugar
dry
but
balanced
first
sip
yields
to
a
burst
of
sweet
fruit
flavored
bubble
gum
and
then
quickly
turns
over
to
a
dry
finish
with
a
good
amount
of
pepper
the
start
and
finish
of
each
sip
are
very
contrasting
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
carries
over
towards
the
back
end
of
the
beer
and
covers
up
part
of
the
pepper
flavor
which
seems
to
work
to
this
beers
advantage
the
pepper
adds
a
nice
dynamic
perhaps
even
better
if
this
were
a
paler
beer
it
still
however
works
nicely
in
the
nose
drinkability
a
black
saison
of
sorts
an
interesting
beer
with
nice
earthy
roasty
and
herbal
characteristics
unique
and
a
decent
beer
cheers
overall
one
of
these
new
fangled
black
saisons
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
but
this
leaves
a
good
impression
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
342011
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
largeish
light
brown
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
bananas
and
brown
sugar
but
really
none
of
the
promised
peppercorns
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
light
bodied
and
tart
with
a
little
funk
roasted
malt
and
spices
overall
drinkability
not
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
the
bottle
says
belgian
style
ale
the
style
on
ba
says
saison
ignoring
labels
the
beer
is
pretty
good
its
got
a
unique
array
of
flavors
that
i
dont
come
across
too
often
and
they
come
together
nicely
ive
got
one
more
bottle
of
this
that
ill
enjoy
and
i
can
see
myself
grabbing
another
bottle
or
two
if
i
see
it
in
my
travels
cheers
o
a
great
beer
for
those
times
when
you
want
something
light
but
not
too
light
this
would
be
easy
to
drink
interesting
without
being
strange
overall
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
farmhouse
ale
id
happily
have
it
again
o
nice
spice
to
it
as
a
saison
would
but
very
different
the
malty
notes
balance
it
out
and
make
it
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
cant
say
that
i
hated
it
but
i
seem
to
be
the
only
person
who
doesnt
really
think
it
can
be
called
a
good
beer
its
average
drinkable
i
didnt
pour
it
out
but
even
if
id
have
brewed
this
myself
id
still
think
it
was
an
average
beer
a
bit
of
a
miss
here
the
beer
needs
some
more
of
the
yeast
flavors
i
like
the
sour
note
but
it
needs
something
else
to
go
with
it
i
didnt
pick
up
much
from
the
darker
malts
not
sure
why
they
are
there
d
it
was
actually
really
drinking
quite
well
but
was
not
as
flavorful
as
other
saisons
ive
had
in
the
past
still
a
cool
dark
saison
light
and
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
not
inappropriate
overall
an
interesting
mix
that
works
pretty
well
drinkability
very
drinkable
like
a
belgian
saison
but
with
a
bigger
roasted
malt
profile
interesting
and
nice
o
well
a
brown
saison
worth
the
try
ill
likely
try
again
creamy
nice
mouthfeel
from
the
dark
malts
light
enough
for
a
saison
at
the
same
time
a
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
finish
nice
unique
beer
i
give
it
up
to
gi
for
this
guy
o
very
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
doesnt
have
much
farmhouse
character
and
i
never
found
the
peppercorns
im
enjoying
the
beer
but
it
seems
like
something
more
in
the
middle
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
to
me
im
marking
this
down
a
bit
for
not
being
to
the
advertised
style
although
its
quite
good
o
much
better
in
the
bottle
than
when
i
had
it
on
draft
last
year
o
this
is
good
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
flavors
besides
the
peppercorn
could
be
more
intense
o
all
jokes
aside
the
aroma
while
somewhat
cloying
is
actually
pretty
good
i
dig
the
peppery
notes
and
spiciness
theres
no
flavor
though
certainly
not
worth
my
3
pepe
will
go
the
way
of
halls
special
beers
down
the
drain
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
this
beer
was
very
dry
and
astringent
in
the
roasted
black
malt
flavors
and
it
covered
up
a
lot
of
the
other
flavors
the
fizz
really
enhanced
the
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
that
that
was
really
a
good
thing
and
there
was
no
saision
yeast
character
noticed
which
was
a
bit
disappointing
pours
black
with
a
touch
of
chestnut
at
the
rim
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
into
a
tulip
it
leaves
some
very
thick
beautiful
lacing
as
well
nose
is
sweet
red
fruit
belgian
yeast
some
interesting
funky
spice
notes
and
maybe
some
sour
applepineapple
taste
is
classic
saison
odd
as
by
looks
you
wouldnt
expect
it
earthy
barn
yard
funk
yeasty
spice
sour
red
fruits
that
hint
at
citrus
mouthfeel
is
slightly
diluted
but
a
nice
beer
regardless
edit
after
much
deliberation
i
lowered
the
taste
score
after
i
was
done
eating
i
proceeded
to
polish
off
the
bottle
and
the
black
pepper
became
more
and
more
assertive
and
astringent
this
was
not
noticed
when
paired
with
the
steak
but
the
score
needed
to
reflect
the
beer
as
a
standalone
not
everyone
will
be
having
a
nice
steak
with
it
so
if
you
get
this
make
sure
youve
got
enough
steak
to
last
through
the
whole
bottle
glad
to
see
this
one
on
tap
to
try
really
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
this
beer
its
a
very
very
dark
brown
with
tints
of
ruby
color
held
up
to
the
light
as
given
to
me
the
head
was
about
1
5
fingers
worth
of
sandy
brown
foam
in
both
smell
and
taste
i
found
this
beer
to
be
light
on
the
spice
i
was
expecting
really
the
spice
taste
was
more
in
keeping
with
what
i
get
in
some
rye
based
beers
than
in
the
peppercorn
kick
i
thought
id
have
i
picked
up
on
some
light
haygrassy
notes
with
small
notes
of
citrus
maybe
some
orange
zest
and
slight
lemon
touches
as
well
i
was
struck
by
how
dry
this
beer
was
nothing
sticks
in
terms
of
the
mouthfeel
and
it
almost
reminded
me
of
a
dry
champagne
for
that
category
overall
this
beer
was
very
different
than
anything
else
ive
had
in
the
saison
style
but
it
just
wasnt
what
i
would
want
on
a
regular
basis
i
still
am
glad
i
tried
it
though
just
for
its
uniqueness
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
wasnt
so
sure
what
to
expect
and
was
even
less
sure
when
i
saw
the
color
of
the
beer
but
its
a
very
interesting
in
a
positive
way
take
on
the
style
i
loved
the
challenge
of
everything
that
was
going
on
and
the
flavors
that
counter
those
in
your
typical
saison
really
shine
overall
i
like
it
pretty
solid
the
flavors
are
nice
and
would
certainly
be
refreshing
and
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
abv
isnt
too
high
to
enjoy
a
few
i
would
gladly
sip
on
this
all
evening
cheers
to
goose
island
well
at
least
for
now
well
have
to
see
how
this
whole
inbev
thing
goes
this
is
def
a
beer
you
might
want
to
share
not
boozey
at
all
but
just
a
kinda
wierd
taste
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
bomber
of
though
just
beware
of
the
nasty
pepper
sage
aftertaste
i
remember
enjoying
the
other
black
saison
ive
tried
though
i
cant
remember
right
now
what
that
was
exactly
so
this
one
from
goose
island
sounds
pretty
intriguing
it
pours
a
smokygarnettinted
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
dark
wheat
mild
belgian
yeast
funk
rye
bread
light
figs
and
a
hint
of
clove
the
taste
explodes
the
clove
adds
some
black
pepper
lightly
chars
the
wheat
and
toasts
the
rye
and
morphs
the
yeastiness
into
a
light
green
appleish
flavor
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
damn
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
but
the
dark
spices
are
overdone
and
seem
to
oerwhelm
and
lethally
strangle
the
other
flavors
more
balance
would
be
a
great
boon
to
this
beer
had
a
bit
of
trouble
figuring
out
what
goose
island
was
up
to
with
this
beer
the
bottle
notes
that
it
is
brewed
with
peppercorns
so
i
was
expecting
a
prominent
black
pepper
bite
but
there
was
only
the
barest
hint
of
pepper
fairly
maltforward
with
moderate
caramel
malt
flavor
a
touch
of
yeasty
funk
but
quite
reserved
all
in
all
one
of
the
less
impressive
goose
island
european
takes
o
pretty
damn
good
not
too
funky
not
too
spicy
nice
balance
with
a
sophisticated
flavor
overy
deceptive
for
a
dark
beer
refreshing
ive
had
other
beers
brewed
with
black
pepper
and
had
a
similar
experience
where
the
taste
turns
out
very
clean
and
refreshing
a
unique
approach
to
the
saison
style
overall
exactly
the
type
of
creativity
i
love
about
goose
island
overall
i
was
expecting
much
more
peppercorn
flavor
instead
it
was
kinda
nondescript
like
i
said
before
these
guys
are
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
country
and
this
is
just
another
reason
why
complexity
flavor
and
easy
drinking
all
mixed
into
one
another
huge
plus
is
that
saisons
are
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
probably
the
farthest
deviation
from
its
origin
but
my
favorite
example
so
far
goose
island
has
another
one
under
their
belt
in
my
eye
and
i
sure
hope
this
whole
merge
with
ab
doesnt
end
up
sour
because
i
know
they
will
be
truly
missed
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
of
this
thing
the
whole
experience
seems
well
crafted
i
encourage
you
to
pick
one
up
if
you
see
one
and
give
it
a
try
ive
been
impressed
with
goose
islands
recent
belgian
releases
pepe
nero
isnt
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
it
is
the
most
interest
and
intriguing
i
was
not
expecting
a
black
saison
didnt
know
such
a
thing
existed
it
honestly
works
better
than
you
might
anticipate
the
dark
malty
flavors
arent
at
odds
with
the
saison
flavors
but
i
dont
think
that
they
add
a
great
deal
or
advance
the
style
in
any
degree
its
a
bit
like
a
black
ipa
in
that
respect
nonetheless
its
definitely
interesting
and
it
is
good
beer
certainly
worth
checking
out
interesting
is
there
such
thing
as
a
belgian
black
ipa
yeast
looms
a
bit
too
large
which
keeps
this
from
being
a
classic
but
complex
layers
of
black
malt
and
hops
and
peppercorn
spice
plus
a
luscious
feel
making
this
compelling
drinking
o
i
wouldnt
have
pegged
this
as
a
saison
type
of
beer
just
from
drinking
it
its
not
bad
but
fairly
uninspiring
good
but
not
great
i
probably
would
have
again
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
bitterness
with
cocoa
and
a
moderately
resiny
sprucelike
character
mildly
grassy
and
haylike
with
a
moderate
acidity
thats
grainy
in
nature
this
is
a
pretty
dry
beer
the
acidity
is
enhanced
by
the
high
carbonation
making
this
really
crisp
like
a
good
saison
should
be
a
prominent
roasted
malt
character
is
present
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
given
that
the
yeast
isnt
particularly
expressive
here
it
adds
a
big
and
interesting
character
to
the
beer
mediumlight
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
is
not
really
to
style
but
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
even
warming
it
up
doesnt
really
bring
out
the
aromatics
like
i
was
hoping
d
fairly
drinkable
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
most
saisons
with
the
smoky
flavors
otherwise
interesting
and
different
and
fairly
tasty
pretty
decent
balance
notes
not
a
bad
offer
from
goose
island
at
all
maybe
short
of
the
marketing
or
the
way
it
has
overflown
the
isles
in
some
places
but
it
is
still
quite
a
good
brew
in
fact
it
may
be
good
as
a
social
quaff
overall
a
solid
but
not
terribly
interesting
black
saison
i
like
this
a
different
take
on
the
saison
checks
all
the
boxes
of
what
i
look
for
in
a
more
sessionable
saison
but
adds
in
some
complexity
to
the
malt
overall
a
decent
idea
from
goose
island
but
the
beer
is
just
not
that
good
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
the
first
real
miss
from
their
otherwise
excellent
belgian
line
drink
overall
this
was
different
unqiue
and
quite
tasty
i
would
have
this
one
again
a
nice
big
bottle
with
good
flavors
and
was
nice
to
sip
on
over
about
an
hour
433
53
53
o
one
is
enough
for
me
in
the
world
of
saison
im
particular
towards
the
dark
stuff
in
march
the
spice
bombs
and
meaty
this
was
something
that
was
that
but
so
clean
around
the
edges
that
latitude
is
marginalized
the
malt
and
spice
make
it
a
tight
package
the
peppercorn
close
the
palate
and
make
it
quite
dry
the
feel
is
frothy
that
contracts
like
a
lager
a
fallout
like
a
good
doppelbock
malt
is
similar
to
something
along
those
lines
toasty
pour
is
amber
with
a
off
white
head
not
meaty
grassy
citrus
with
a
toasty
finish
malt
and
bitter
munich
this
beer
is
interesting
complex
fun
and
very
drinkable
finish
coriander
is
still
very
subtle
with
pepper
flavors
lying
on
the
palate
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
under
the
saison
category
as
i
mentioned
earlier
but
i
dont
care
this
is
a
solid
solid
beer
i
guess
i
would
hope
for
a
more
of
the
peppercorn
to
stand
out
since
they
tout
it
on
the
bottle
but
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
see
many
novice
craft
beer
drinkers
liking
i
think
its
an
ok
beer
its
easy
to
drink
but
to
rate
it
according
to
its
style
as
a
saison
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
found
it
came
up
lacking
in
flavor
i
give
it
points
for
originality
on
the
pairing
of
pepper
with
a
saison
but
wasnt
in
love
with
the
final
product
o
i
kinda
like
this
not
what
i
expected
i
was
expecting
either
heavy
pepper
or
heavy
belgian
funk
this
was
neither
more
like
a
woodsy
leathery
spicy
rye
stout
o
slightly
better
than
average
overall
impression
as
it
is
a
little
bit
interesting
due
to
the
peppers
but
not
like
i
really
would
seek
this
out
thanks
to
seeswo
for
the
extra
2011
vintage
served
in
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
at
53
degrees
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
dense
two
inch
creamcolored
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
skim
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
and
exhibited
good
retention
nose
expresses
clove
and
coriander
and
a
trace
of
earthiness
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
also
a
slightly
buttery
flavor
that
comes
out
in
the
middle
of
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
mild
creamy
texture
overall
a
decent
domestic
farmhouse
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
here
nonetheless
its
pleasant
and
drinkable
although
lacking
some
of
the
character
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
o
i
like
this
one
a
whole
lot
had
it
on
tap
next
to
stillwaters
existent
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
not
sure
if
i
would
be
down
paying
bomber
prices
for
this
one
though
and
glad
i
dont
have
to
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
saison
there
are
a
few
too
many
flavors
fighting
for
attention
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
but
it
definitely
wasnt
bad
o
overall
i
like
this
ale
and
as
i
must
admit
to
a
great
deal
of
ignorance
of
this
style
of
ale
i
hope
my
review
doesnt
do
it
an
injustice
its
very
good
and
i
would
try
it
again
very
happily
the
one
negative
i
would
attribute
to
it
is
its
price
at
8
49
for
a
bomber
i
think
i
could
find
greater
value
elsewhere
great
marriage
of
contrasting
styles
working
together
surprisingly
well
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
very
porterlike
but
has
the
funky
yeast
quality
of
a
saison
interesting
and
flavorful
d
this
isnt
bad
just
not
my
kind
of
saison
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
ill
stick
with
something
else
reviewed
from
notes
pour
yields
a
nearlyblack
beer
with
a
mochacolored
head
and
some
nice
retention
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
earth
and
pepper
along
with
some
belgian
yeast
spiciness
the
peppercorn
really
stands
out
in
the
nose
and
that
carries
over
into
the
flavor
a
bit
of
roasted

obvious
peppercorn
would
have
really
made
this
brew
great
otherwise
its
just
ok
this
whole
blackening
of
pale
beers
isnt
my
thing
there
is
too
much
of
a
negating
factor
going
on
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
great
d
very
different
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
great
for
a
night
of
tasting
different
brews
the
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
and
even
slightly
quenching
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
lots
of
this
beer
but
not
the
most
exciting
to
do
so
d
this
is
an
interesting
brew
by
goose
island
it
is
a
new
take
on
the
saison
style
for
me
it
is
another
winner
in
their
belgian
ale
lineup
however
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
peppercorn
from
this
beer
either
way
good
beer
from
goose
island
this
belgian
farmhousestyle
ale
opens
with
some
rather
beautiful
bottle
art
sparse
stark
and
classy
it
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
almost
black
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
lacing
on
the
glass
hmm
a
provocative
aroma
i
get
a
little
heat
no
doubt
the
peppercorns
rather
than
the
alcohol
its
a
relatively
tame
6
the
taste
wow
this
is
different
i
get
a
strong
malt
sense
in
there
but
its
quickly
tamed
down
by
the
spice
it
all
finishes
well
with
a
peppery
roastiness
on
the
palate
its
all
balanced
and
welltasty
superb
a
black
saison
a
winter
saison
jons
bottle
and
finally
caught
up
with
this
one
that
i
missed
in
nyc
a
dark
body
above
average
mouthfeel
a
sipper
of
chocolate
coffee
spruce
pepper
crossstyle
with
a
shwartzbier
wonderful
aroma
bit
of
smoke
pours
black
brown
shows
up
in
light
slight
white
head
and
light
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
yeast
dark
fruit
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
raisin
and
a
leathery
note
round
this
off
taste
is
of
yeast
light
sourness
tart
lemony
and
a
slight
roasty
quality
are
here
solid
and
runs
a
wide
range
of
flavours
very
complex
brew
solid
mouthfeel
medium
to
light
weight
and
good
use
of
carbonation
drinks
very
well
and
would
be
a
great
all
night
brew
abv
isnt
too
high
so
it
can
be
sessionable
good
stuff
d
this
beer
is
very
nice
not
among
the
better
saisons
ive
tried
but
then
again
im
new
to
the
style
d
im
not
sure
this
is
a
true
saison
but
it
is
pretty
dern
tasty
d
i
think
its
drinkable
i
like
it
and
its
not
too
big
or
whatever
makes
things
undrinkable
its
not
that
drinks
like
a
saison
with
a
little
twist
and
no
peppercorns
are
evident
to
me
id
like
it
a
lot
more
if
they
did
show
up
i
drank
this
while
eating
some
spicy
bbq
pizza
which
turned
out
to
be
an
excellent
pairing
overall
its
ok
something
a
little
different
another
good
belgian
beer
put
out
by
goose
island
pours
very
very
dark
almost
black
a
decent
amount
of
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
for
quiite
a
while
coats
the
edges
of
the
glass
nicely
smells
malty
and
sweet
some
floral
yeast
aromas
and
a
nice
touch
of
almost
chocolate
on
the
nose
tastes
rich
and
malty
sme
subtle
roasted
flavours
combined
with
the
floral
yeastiness
might
have
almost
a
peppery
taste
fairly
sweet
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
good
mouthfeel
i
fact
feels
great
on
the
palette
vry
drinkable
as
i
would
expect
for
a
beer
like
this
aroma
and
taste
were
very
surprising
as
i
thought
this
would
be
more
of
a
belgian
dubbel
at
first
glance
this
beer
is
obviously
a
dark
or
black
saison
very
interesting
and
different
curious
to
see
if
any
of
the
big
name
belgian
saisons
will
try
this
style
an
enjoyable
beer
but
if
i
was
forced
to
rate
this
purely
against
other
saisons
it
probably
wouldnt
come
out
as
great
as
im
rating
it
here
here
im
not
going
to
let
the
idea
that
i
dont
really
think
this
is
a
saison
interfere
with
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
very
good
drinkable
beer
but
as
a
dark
saison
i
think
jolly
pumpkins
bam
noire
outclasses
it
not
to
mention
fantomes
dark
white
notes
not
sure
what
to
call
this
saison
doesnt
seem
right
reminds
me
in
some
ways
of
a
porter
the
burnt
toastchar
flavors
and
the
color
but
not
exactly
whatever
it
is
its
solid
as
expected
from
goose
island
d
this
is
a
nice
saison
im
a
little
confused
as
to
why
it
was
blackened
i
was
searching
for
roasted
grains
and
came
up
empty
pretty
good
balance
of
flavors
but
again
the
carbonation
is
a
little
harsh
a
beautifully
crafted
saison
with
great
drinkability
lighter
bodied
ale
pours
a
bright
coffee
brown
with
mild
tan
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
roasty
with
yeast
undertones
the
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
pepper
spice
blend
nicely
with
the
light
roast
malts
that
carry
this
enjoyable
brew
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
very
smooth
and
silky
feel
that
is
quite
pleasant
sort
of
feels
more
like
a
red
ale
with
porter
characteristics
quite
creamy
in
the
mouth
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
jcnd9803
pours
cola
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
of
candied
sugar
belgian
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
a
slight
punch
of
spice
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
fizzy
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
tasty
beer
d
a
bit
dry
which
keeps
it
refreshing
not
particularly
interesting
but
not
bad
the
beer
appears
shockingly
dark
with
a
tan
head
initially
i
think
that
i
have
been
served
the
wrong
beer
but
alas
pepe
nero
is
a
dark
saison
daccord
the
rye
comes
through
quite
strongly
with
an
odd
and
interesting
aroma
and
flavor
of
funk
not
funky
like
wild
yeast
or
odd
like
i
got
a
bad
beer
just
funky
and
odd
ya
dig
the
flavor
brings
subtle
chocolate
and
roast
flavors
but
i
cant
discern
peppercorns
per
se
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
solid
carbonation
level
overall
this
was
intriguing
and
fun
to
try
but
im
not
interested
in
having
it
again
overall
somewhere
between
a
dubble
and
strong
dark
for
style
a
fine
very
enjoyable
beer
but
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
wasnt
disappointed
that
the
black
peppercorns
werent
showcased
more
the
chocolate
flavors
totally
overwhelm
them
thinking
about
this
i
recall
reading
that
goose
was
going
for
a
dark
saisonboy
a
saison
sure
didnt
come
to
mind
while
drinking
this
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
the
peppercorns
to
take
you
for
a
wild
ride
d
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
this
really
is
not
a
saison
other
than
in
name
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
a
saison
call
it
something
else
and
the
scores
might
go
up
beer
is
light
in
body
and
smooth
but
the
finish
is
quite
bitter
and
roasty
there
is
some
spiciness
yeasty
breadiness
in
the
midpalate
it
was
ok
but
nothing
special
i
was
disappointed
d
while
the
bulk
of
the
review
may
make
it
seem
as
though
i
am
giving
a
rather
harsh
review
the
beer
is
really
more
enjoyable
than
this
review
lets
on
standing
back
from
the
beer
a
bit
and
giving
myself
time
to
enjoy
its
nuances
opens
the
beer
up
just
a
bit
more
good
beer
but
will
not
be
replacing
any
of
my
current
favorites
from
the
goose
island
reserve
series
decent
carbonation
level
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
less
carbonated
for
some
palates
i
appreciate
that
the
beer
remains
dry
despite
the
addition
of
malts
not
usually
found
in
the
saison
style
unfortunately
this
expirement
does
not
make
for
a
shining
example
of
drinkability
in
the
style
it
lacks
depth
favoring
an
aggressive
clove
peppercorn
flavor
profile
and
the
cooked
spinachlike
finish
becomes
tiresome
in
a
hurry
still
its
a
fun
beer
and
worthy
of
a
purchase
if
you
havent
tried
it
before
while
this
beer
disappoints
me
i
remain
very
excited
about
goose
islands
entire
fantasticallylabled
belgianstyle
ale
series
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
it
the
pepper
wasnt
what
i
expected
which
turned
out
to
be
a
good
thing
i
want
to
see
if
the
pepper
comes
out
a
bit
more
if
it
sits
for
a
while
the
botttle
claims
5
years
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
with
so
many
other
options
out
there
i
doubt
ill
have
it
again
d
its
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
nothing
too
special
about
it
other
than
it
being
dark
for
the
style
it
represents
pours
black
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
smell
is
roasty
and
fresh
and
phenolic
with
a
little
plummy
sweetness
flavor
is
roasted
and
plummy
with
a
sweet
coffeeish
toffee
character
with
a
chalky
slightly
metallic
bite
there
is
a
pleasant
coffeelike
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
brown
sugar
and
beets
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
achingly
dry
almost
astringent
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bubblegum
roasted
malt
dates
and
a
hint
of
anise
this
beer
smells
nothing
like
any
saison
ive
ever
tried
but
is
does
smell
quite
good
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
is
very
malty
with
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
phenols
and
a
bunch
of
roasted
malt
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
on
medium
bodied
with
a
cloying
texture
and
low
carbonation
for
any
belgian
style
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
drinkability
comes
across
as
a
more
mellow
saison
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
most
noticeable
by
the
molasses
aroma
and
taste
also
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
dunkelweizen
overall
mellow
but
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
meh
this
wasnt
my
favorite
saison
or
my
favorite
thing
goose
island
has
produced
ill
sit
on
a
couple
of
others
i
have
for
a
while
to
see
if
they
get
better
but
i
wont
be
rushing
to
try
this
again
for
a
while

thats

i
think
its
a

its
definitely
worth

i
liked
it
d
this
is
pretty
gooda
successful
brew
not
a
normal
saison
but
wellexecuted
nonetheless
very
balanced
with
a
nice
abv
make
for
a
solid
drinking
experience
perhaps
too
tart
for
winter
but
too
dark
for
summer
id
call
this
a
midmarch
quaff
4
5
d
good
beer
i
decided
to
give
this
a
4
5
for
drinkibility
because
a
lot
of
the
above
scores
could
have
easily
be
the
next
highest
good
flavors
and
interesting
i
would
like
another
but
i
only
have
this
one
d
the
abv
and
the
unique
mingling
of
toasted
and
sour
flavors
are
unique
and
worth
a
bottle
or
two
d
an
interesting
take
on
a
saison
that
i
rather
enjoyed
a
bit
richer
and
darker
representation
but
it
was
well
done
not
for
me
something
simply
was
not
happening
here
the
beer
looked
fantastic
and
after
having
ithaca
brewings
dark
saison
this
passed
summer
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
but
this
was
a
beer
in
conflict
one
of
these
a
night
is
enough
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
a
solid
offering
but
just
not
what
im
looking
for
for
the
long
haul
d
would
have
no
problem
drinking
two
or
three
goes
down
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
about
this
beer
another
solid
goose
island
offering
drank
in
february
2011
will
drink
again
in
a
few
years
overall
this
beer
was
only
ok
i
think
this
beer
could
likely
get
a
lot
better
with
age
and
i
will
throw
a
few
in
the
basement
and
maybe
review
again
in
a
few
years
first
the
black
ipa
and
now
the
black
saison
i
certainly
applaud
the
creativity
whether
or
not
this
beer
would
ever
be
top
notch
for
its
kind
it
has
definitely
set
a
path
for
a
new
direction
that
i
hope
will
be
explored
by
other
brewers
i
dont
know
if
i
would
give
it
a
definitive
saison
label
but
i
have
little
to
suggest
otherwise
i
would
say
if
you
can
find
it
and
you
like
either
saisons
or
stouts
give
it
a
try
there
are
worse
things
you
could
spend

bottled

interesting
beer
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
and
doesnt
seem
entirely
focused
but
it
was
good
and
definitely
has
some
potential
not
really
like
a
saison
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
rye
and
earthy
flavors
being
strongest
worth
of
try
and
it
is
good
but
it
could
be
better
ive
been
anxiously
awaiting
this
beers
release
especially
since
ive
never
had
a
black
saison
before
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
silky
dark
dark
brown
that
is
on
the
verge
of
black
with
a
light
half
finger
dark
khaki
head
that
laces
the
glass
it
resembles
a
stout
the
smell
is
very
funky
and
earthy
it
kind
of
smells
like
wet
dirt
after
a
rain
but
in
a
good
way
the
aromas
are
a
little
subdued
the
flavor
is
interesting
comparing
this
to
a
usual
saison
probably
isnt
fair
it
has
a
lot
of
funk
a
good
amount
of
yeast
but
then
it
finishes
with
this
slightly
bitter
flavor
kind
of
like
plastic
i
dont
know
if
its
the
peppercorns
or
what
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
strongest
part
of
this
very
fresh
saison
it
drinks
and
looks
like
a
stout
its
crisp
when
it
hits
your
palate
then
mellows
to
go
down
very
smoothly
im
a
little
disappointed
yet
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
my
first
black
saison
the
flavor
is
just
very
different
ill
age
another
bottle
to
see
if
it
ages
as
gracefully
as
goose
islands
other
bombers
d
a
very
tasty
beverage
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
with
some
grilled
meat
in
the
early
spring
for
sure
this
begs
to
be
paired
with
grilled
meat
drinking
it
by
itself
i
dont
think
it
holds
up
as
much
this
is
really
a
beer
that
is
for
pairing
and
sort
of
makes
one
step
back
and
realize
how
well
integrated
beer
can
be
in
cuisine
drinkability
while
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
it
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
this
could
possibly
be
my
favorite
of
the
nonsour
goose
island
belgians
a
quality
dark
saison
d
quite
drinkable
very
nice
overall
and
the
peppery
finish
is
interesting
d
easy
to
drink
i
love
that
it
is
a
dark
saison
unique
and
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
creamy
feel
medium
bodied
dry
and
slightly
bitter
not
so
much
as
a
tingle
from
the
pepper
pleasant
mellowness
in
the
finish
the
light
roast
and
mild
coffee
flavors
arrive
first
with
some
earthy
peppercorn
notes
but
again
not
all
that
spicy
feels
more
like
a
straightforward
belgian
dark
ale
without
the
sweetness
not
sweet
at
all
again
fairly
dry
some
estery
qualities
for
sure
banana
almost
fairly
phenolic
with
notes
of
clove
and
licorice
d
this
tastes
nice
but
very
disappointed
after
reading
the
label
stating
it
a
was
belgian
saisonfarmhouse
ale
wpeppercorn
tasted
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
meets
a
porter
still
worth
trying
but
not
cosmically
divine
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
saison
for
a
change
but
seems
to
be
missing
the
so
called
pepper
feel
that
it
boasts
about
so
i
am
not
exactly
drawn
to
it
d
glad
i
tried
it
a
nice
version
of
the
style
but
wouldnt
personally
seek
it
out
again
the
alcohol
is
about
right
with
the
6
d
itll
take
me
a
while
to
finish
this
22oz
bottle
and
i
wouldnt
be
longing
for
another
d
i
really
dug
this
i
really
liked
that
this
take
on
a
black
saison
included
lots
of
earthy
hops
pepper
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
this
is
not
a
dark
saison
with
lots
of
bright
fruit
funk
and
hay
its
somehow
a
little
more
sinister
overall
a
great
beer
from
a
great
line
of
beers
it
is
a
unique
and
interesting
twist
on
the
typical
saison
and
is
unapologetically
original
and
interesting
recommended
pepe
nero
is
a
let
down
after
being
so
pleased
with
sofie
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
after
spending
some
time
in
a
cellar
dthis
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
saison
ive
had
a
couple
that
were
a
little
too
in
your
face
with
the
yeast
notes
and
barnyard
but
this
one
avoids
going
in
that
direction
as
a
result
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
people
who
are
new
to
the
style
drinkability
i
have
not
had
a
black
saison
before
but
this
is
a
valuable
addition
to
their
lineup
definitely
something
i
will
come
back
to
when
i
am
thinking
about
a
gi
particularly
after
their
very
middleoftheroad
belgian
series
thus
far
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
is
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
is
an
exteemly
easy
drinker
well
worth
repeating
and
it
went
well
with
my
farmers
panini
though
pepe
nero
is
a
very
clean
and
drinkable
saison
it
lacks
the
intensity
of
flavor
and
the
raw
earthy
notes
that
make
authentic
saisons
so
desirable

also
picking

really
carries
the
drinkability
of
a
regular
saison
flavors
overall
seem
balanced
with
a
good
level
of
complexity
not
your
typical
saisonfarmhouse
but
a
good
take
on
the
style
and
another
good
speciatly
from
goose
island
very
drinkable
beer
interesting
to
see
what
it
would
be
like
with
6
or
12
months
in
the
cellar
have
to
stock
up
on
a
few
or
just
brew
my
own
very
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
i
wold
make
a
long
session
out
of
had
one
22oz
bottle
and
that
was
a
good
amount
will
be
picking
up
another
bottle
soon
to
see
how
it
conditions
over
time
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
i
kind
of
like
it
somewhat
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
too
much
of
it
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
the
finish
is
missing
something
nice
beer
fairly
drinkable
a
couple
in
a
sitting
would
be
welcome
though
not
necessarily
my
first
choice
an
interesting
style
but
not
my
favorite
d
an
ok
beer
but
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
a
saison
as
others
have
noted
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
d
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
i
really
like
the
soft
and
light
saisons
hennepinsofie
being
my
favs
this
would
be
the
deeper
darker
cousin
to
sofie
id
have
a
sofie
over
pepe
nero
any
day
of
the
week
in
the
summer
or
any
time
really
since
thats
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
but
this
one
could
be
a
great
fall
beer
if
you
are
into
matching
beers
with
seasons
today
seems
a
bit
warm
for
such
a
dark
saison
i
think
ill
stay
inside
with
the
ac
instead
of
bringing
this
one
on
the
deck
in
this
95
degree
weather
i
dont
think
ill
have
much
trouble
polishing
off
this
12
growler
id
have
it
again
for
sure
great
gateway
saison
beer
for
fans
of
darker
beers
pours
a
dark
black
with
very
little
head
smells
sweet
with
hints
of
fig
taste
is
sweet
like
molasses
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
tobacco
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
i
like
it
its
also
quite
sweet
drinkability
is
good
bit
the
unusual
flavors
detract
overall
a
very
good
brew
as
its
quite
different
from
the
norm
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
decent
eggshell
colored
head
that
falls
to
nothing
after
not
too
long
nose
is
a
tight
pine
tone
flavor
is
a
bit
unusual
for
the
style
i
think
a
bit
earthy
and
rough
on
the
aftertaste
and
slightly
stringent
and
there
is
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
alcohol
burn
on
the
end
too
that
stays
in
my
mouth
as
an
aftertaste
seems
a
bit
wrinkled
and
needs
a
run
through
with
an
iron
to
straighten
things
out
a
bit
which
i
guess
sums
things
up
for
this
beer
in
general
really
not
entirely
a
miss
but
couldve
and
shouldve
been
a
whole
lot
more
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
brew
im
glad
i
found
it
on
tap
tasted
on
draft
at
bad
apple
pours
almost
black
with
a
tint
of
amber
the
head
is
thin
but
long
lasting
and
offwhite
nose
of
rock
candy
yeast
some
breadiness
and
both
light
coffee
and
coconut
flavor
is
very
light
considering
the
color
with
citrus
candy
black
pepper
yeast
and
bread
the
dark
malt
comes
through
on
the
back
with
coffee
and
chocolate
carbonation
and
body
are
both
fairly
light
with
a
long
dark
finish
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
dark
semitranslucent
brown
with
some
sandy
head
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
of
funk
some
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
peppercorn
tastes
pretty
good
a
some
more
of
the
fruity
saison
flavors
but
with
some
chocolate
and
peppercorn
mixed
in
very
interesting
light
body
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
very
smooth
very
good
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
cubbies
to
start
this
is
something
like
what
fantome
is
doing
but
much
cleaner
it
isnt
bad
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
this
beer
is
really
good
to
drink
just
dont
call
it
a
saison
or
drink
it
expecting
to
get
that
drinkability
ok
didnt
need
a
2nd
d
this
one
isnt
mindblowing
but
its
still
quite
good
and
a
great
attempt
at
pushing
the
envelope
md
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
slightly
watery
reasonably
drinkable
the
complexity
is
something
that
needs
to
be
focused
on
to
appreciate
d
goes
down
easy
just
like
gis
other
offerings
it
goes
down
easy
with
loads
of
flavor
a
dangerous
combination
typically
however
its
4
beer
night
and
i
think
ill
have
a
few
more
d
pretty
good
unique
take
on
the
style
i
dont
know
if
i
had
a
bad
glass
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
new
keg
or
a
keg
that
was
tapped
wrong
or
mishandled
or
if
that
is
the
nature
of
the
beer
based
on
previous
reviews
i
think
i
might
need
to
revisit
this
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
not
something
worth
trading
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
but
fans
of
unique
american
takes
on
belgian
farmhouse
beers
would
love
this
i
dig
some
other
gi
beers
more
like
sophie
but
this
was
worth
a
shot
pretty
good
albeit
different
and
interesting
brew
from
goose
island
was
surprised
at
how
dark
it
poured
for
a
saison
and
thought
the
roasted
malt
was
definitely
different
and
unique
notes
i
was
very
surprised
to
not
find
this
listed
on
ba
but
rechecking
with
rays
place
in
kent
and
then
the
goose
island
web
site
i
was
assured
that
the
name
of
the
beer
is
correct
no
word
on
the
abv
unfortunately
very
good
saison
d
could
definitively
do
a
few
of
these
halia
is
a
damn
fine
beer
its
juicy
bright
and
approachable
to
the
point
i
cant
see
anyone
disliking
it
whether
into
beer
or
not
drinkability
is
absurdly
high
while
theres
enough
tartness
to
make
it
totally
refreshing
recommended
more
sour
on
the
nose
butter
and
a
bit
of
tart
taste
profile
minimal
peach
very
drinkable
all
the
girls
are
a
sour
drinkers
dream
come
true
overall
outstanding
brew
the
big
sour
funk
punch
works
seamlessly
with
the
white
wine
and
peach
notes
to
make
one
hell
of
tasty
american
sour
the
dry
finish
really
sells
this
guy
by
leaving
the
fruit
and
wine
notes
buzzing
on
the
tongue
letting
you
really
enjoy
the
complex
flavors
of
this
beer
after
every
sip
was
blown
away
by
this
one
super
light
but
still
sour

you

a

quickly
however
theres
a

white

some

i
think

the
nice

character
in
the
aroma
is
delicate
with
great
brett
character
blending
in
and
strong
support
from
the
fruity

notes
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
didnt
last
long
on
a
cool
summer
evening
overall
4

hell
of
a
beer
the
price
is
a
little
prohibitive
unfortunately
but
forgetting
that
its
a
great
example
of
why
sours
are
still
the
future
of
craft
beer
any
wine
lover
should
be
able
to
appreciate
this
beer
in
addition
to
the
beer
geeks
already
in
the
know
and
it
feels
like
a
crowd
pleaser
for
anyone
with
a
discriminating
palate
and
plenty
of
folks
less
interested
in
such
things
too
my
only
gripes
are
that
the
mouthfeel
could
be
smoother
the
oak
could
be
more
understated
and
the
fruit
could
pop
a
little
more
but
the
sour
dynamics
are
spoton
it
drinks
like
a
champ
and
is
as
refreshing
as
a
cold
shower
in
the
tropics
love
it
o
a
great
wine
barrel
aged
fruit
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
just
a
touch
of
funk
and
tartness
to
make
this
stand
out
o
very
drinkable
and
high
quality
but
i
have
a
problem
with
the
price
tag
and
the
false
advertisement
of
peaches
a
little
less
white
wine
and
at
least
a
discernible
level
of
peaches
would
benefit
it
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
be
looking
to
dole
out
the
chedda
for
it
overall
its
a
good
fruited
saison
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
pnb
ive
been
spoiled
with
lately
vey
nice
sour
not
too
much
of
the
peach
flavor
came
though
in
the
taste
more
in
the
nose
with

waft
of
sweetness
hazy
complexion
with
good
head
retention
nice
smooth
sour
flavor
if
those
2
adjectives
go
together
nice
drinkable
sour
possibly
good
introduction
to
sours
overall
the
peaches

nicely

just

with

to
it
ok
saison
but
for
the
cost
i
would
prefer
a
lift
bridge
farm
girl
funky
farmhouse
smell
not
offputting
heavy
in
the
malt
sweet
smell
taste
is
somewhat
citrus
but
a
lot
of
black
pepper
spices
and
dry
malt
finish
this
is
good
beer
didnt
care
for
this
one
a
real
generic
saison
for
a
brewery
i
know
to
be
one
of
the
most
distinct
of
all
so
this
was
a
real
letdown
not
that
i
expected
much
from
their
saison
its
not
their
game
but
still
this
was
disheartening
a
flat
looking
hazy
blonde
beer
thick
with
sediment
and
hardly
holding
a
quarter
inch
head
its
all
belgian
yeast
esters
very
little
real
grain
character
or
funk
to
this
and
without
that
it
needs
to
be
elegant
but
unlike
the
lively
belgian
or
french
versions
this
one
is
just
heavy
with
spent
yeast
and
wheat
malt
and
never
gets
anywhere
there
is
a
grassy
hop
thing
to
it
which
is
its
only
real
unique
feature
but
the
mouthfeel
is
dense
and
sweet
and
it
really
doesnt
work
all
that
well
against
all
saisons
on
the
market
its
not
at
all
bad
above
average
even
but
by
surly
standards
its
pretty
poor
stick
to
what
you
are
good
at
here
because
you
are
so
good
at
it
the
price
is
preeeetty
steep
on
this
beer
no
doubt
cheaper
per
can
in
a
pack
but
it
is
a
very
good
saison
that
hit
the
spot
since
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
one
certainly
not
the
most
wild
saison
ive
had
but
its
a
very
very
good
example
of
one
and
one
that
is
super
drinkable
if
it
werent
for
the
price
and
the
fact
surly
doesnt
distribute
to
michigan
id
make
this
a
goto
saison
delicious
i
just
started
getting
into
saisons
this
summer
and
although
i
dont
have
a
huge
sample
size
to
go
off
of
this
was
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
had
i
know
surly
is
known
more
for
their
ipas
but
this
beer
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
gotta
thank
vdubb
for
allowing
me
to
finally
try
this
stuff
out
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
brassgold
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
clove
black
pepper
belgian
yeast
light
sourdough
and
a
touch
of
dried
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
bit
of
grass
and
flowers
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
saison
or
whatever
theyre
calling
it
nowadays
especially
from
cans
nuff
said
overall
alrgiht
probably
wouldnt
spend
10
on
a
4pack
but
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
a
decent
lawnmowing
beer
a
bit
more
belgian
than
i
was
expecting
the
belgian
yeast
really
comes
on
strong
with
this
one
and
thats
a
good
thing
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
this
one
comes
on
slowly
and
leaves
you
thinking
dam
thats
an
awesome
farmhouse
style
beer
if
you
like
this
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
surly
cynic
is
a
light
enjoyable
drink
that
keeps
you
on
your
toes
with
a
complex
sweet
finish
d
probably
my
first
belgian
style
from
a
can
and
a
tasty
one
at
that
flavors
are
rather
restrained
making
this
good
but
not
particularly
great
imo
perfect
for
warmer
weather
affairs
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
crispness
surly
doesnt
make
a
bad
brew
would
have
again
this
a
very
unique
very
enjoyable
saison
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
wow
this
stuff
is
good
as
for
why
its
good
its
refreshing
but
not
boring
at
all
the
black
pepper
flavors
are
flat
awesome
ive
never
tasted
that
in
a
beer
before
apricots
pears
and
some
other
light
fruits
are
present
in
this
one
but
whats
great
about
this
beer
is
that
its
not
sweet
its
kinda
peppery
just
so
cool
so
good
so
refreshing
a
very
underrated
beer
even
at
the
90outstanding
rating
you
see
above
in
my
humble
opinion
overall
no
surprise
surly
brings
another
high
quality
brew
really
enjoyed
the
carbonation
in
this
brew
which
really
made
it
an
easy
drinking
saison
excellent
balance
of
fruits
and
spice
recommendation
a
must
try
for
belgian
drinkers
i
really
think
that
surly
decided
to
make
a
pretty
easy
going
belgianstyle
pale
ale
when
they
made
this
and
rebranded
it
as
a
saison
due
to
the
grassy
hoppy
profile
as
well
as
the
spice
and
funk
in
the
yeast
dont
expect
anything
super
complex
however
this
drinks
far
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
or
a
lowly
pilsner
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
definitely
wouldnt
be
a
bad
option
for
me
if
i
had
it
at
a
bar
or
something
but
with
so
many
far
more
complex
and
intriguing
saisons
out
there
as
well
as
those
that
are
equally
refreshing
this
does
feel
a
bit
lost
out
at
sea
overall
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
saison
will
def
pick
some
of
this
up
for
warmer
weather
binnys
had
a
2
off
coupon
so
i
had
to
try
it
overall
this
is
my
first
saison
in
a
can
i
have
drank
a
beer
that
tastes
exactly
like
this
but
i
can
not
put
my
finger
on
what
that
beer
is
this
beer
is
a
well
made
sasion
that
does
not
have
too
much
wow
factor
but
it
is
a
nice
straight
forward
saison
thats
true
to
it
respective
beer
style
i
would
call
it
effortlessly
good
i
would
consider
this
my
personal
lawnmower
beer
since
i
dislike
flavor
less
light
beer
aka
bmc
beers
bonus
points
as
always
for
beer
packaged
in
a
can
a
surprisingly
delicious
beer
overall
just
super
easy
drinking
abv
absolutely
undectable
recommended
mouthfeel
is
great
crisp
but
good
bodied
carbonation
is
spot
on
for
the
style
there
is
a
creamy
finish
from
the
oats
that
is
really
nice
another
really
impressive
beer
from
surly
their
brewing
is
a
lot
more
sophisticated
than
the
average
well
respected
american
brewerys
furious
abrasive
darkness
all
these
beers
are
in
big
bold
popular
american
styles
but
they
are
all
very
multifaceted
and
subtly
crafted
cynicale
is
no
exception
to
the
trend
of
fine
work
from
surly
oda
supremely
drinkable
refreshing
saison
nothing
too
inventive
or
crazy
here
just
a
fun
can
of
beer
o
an
easy
drinking
saison
that
will
pair
with
any
meal
or
on
its
own
do
a
satisfying
and
approachable
saison
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
belgian
yeast
influence
not
to
mention
the
other
detectable
continental
ingredients
surlys
cynic
is
something
of
a
black
sheep
for
that
brewery
and
probably
worth
a
try
even
by
those
that
do
not
favor
ales
such
as
furious
or

overall
a

take
on
the

of

and
it
comes
in

stellar
get
some

it
does
taste
a
little
bit
like
a
standard
wheat
beer
i
was
hoping
for
more
funkyness
cynicale
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
long
lasting
lacing

there
is
a
strong
sweet
and
yeasty
aroma
with
creamy

the
taste
has
a
subtle
belgian
candy
undertone
with
a
stronger
yeasty
and
beady
like
flavor
rounding
it
out
perfect
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
overall
the
best
saison
i
have
had
to
date
o
this
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
saison
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
boot
if
this
was
available
to
me
regularly
it
would
be
a
staple
for
me
during
the
summer
very
interesting
take
on
the
farmhouse
style
i
definitely
like
this
better
than
ommegang
hennepin
which
is
ironic
as
minneapolis
is
located
in
hennepin
county
funny
that
ommegang
is
pricing
themselves
out
here
surly
makes
some
great
shelf
beers
here
that
holds
up
well
stylewise
overall
a
solid
saison
with
a
nice
subtle
earthy
and
tart
character
o
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
saison
if
i
had
this
i
would
have
it
often
in
the
summer
very
nice
flavor
profile
od
drinkable
but
definitely
not
too
intensly
interesting
more
hopping
might
improve
this
a
tad
spice
was
a
bit
much
but
it
was
decent
overall
3
75
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
i
may
have
been
sliiightly
generous
on
a
point
here
and
there
but
i
give
this
credit
for
being
a
quaffable
saison
in
a
great
package
4packs
of
16oz
cans
cmon
dont
we
all
wish
we
could
get
saisons
as
such
good
for
them
i
say
and
i
wish
other
breweries
ahem
sixpoint
would
follow
suit
as
for
the
beer
in
my
opinion
it
was
slightly
too
phenolic
the
herbal
qualities
were
not
always
flattering
and
could
use
more
spice
and
hops
to
help
balance
the
malt
not
that
it
was
a
particularly
malty
saison
in
any
way
but
still
but
undoubtedly
a
good
saison
that
performs
better
slightly
warmer
as
fits
the
style
glad
to
have
tried
o
a
great
farmhouse
style
beer
i
wouldnt
quite
call
it
mild
but
the
flavors
are
all
wellbalanced
which
leads
to
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
overall
only
touches
on
the
components
that
would
make
a
it
a
really
good
saison
but
there
arent
any
flaws
or
offflavors
surly
always
makes
a
good
product
o
decent
but
not
something
id
seek
out
too
often
the
mashup
of
styles
doesnt
work
well
for
me
the
beer
is
mediumlight
to
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
foams
up
nicely
as
it
moves
across
the
palate
traveling
fairly
smoothly
and
without
harsh
fizz
closes
out
semidry
and
with
little
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
o
i
have
to
admit
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
surly
has
done
an
excellent
job
of
reimagining
the
saison
style
and
has
delivered
something
that
is
far
from
cliche
really
solid
brew
o
a
nice
saison
from
surly
pretty
standard
well
balanced
and
drinkable
not
a
huge
inyourface
beer
but
it
comes
together
nicely
and
goes
down
easily
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowish
gold
color
the
nose
is
strong
with
yeast
a
slight
bubble
gum
and
slight
citrus
fruits
comes
across
the
palate
as
balanced
hops
and
malt
with
slight
floral
notes
it
has
subtle
finish
that
gradually
dissipates
very
good
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
smallmedium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
wow
not
what
i
was
expecting
now
that
i
read
about
this
beer
a
saison
in
a
can
if
anyone
can
do
it
its
surly
i
suppose
smells
somewhat
similar
to
a
saison
but
with
a
strang
malt
liquor
aroma
there
is
the
black
pepper
spiciness
and
belgian
yeast
aromas
of
a
good
saison
not
much
funk
though
however
this
strange
malt
liquor
aroma
is
somewhat
offputting
taste
is
a
little
better
luckily
it
does
not
taste
like
malt
liquor
it
does
taste
like
a
saison
a
great
saison
no
the
pepper
and
spiciness
is
there
the
light
fruitiness
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
are
there
a
ton
of
floral
flavors
it
lacks
the
funk
and
has
some
strange
flavors
that
ive
never
got
from
any
saisonfarmhouse
ale
before
as
it
warms
im
starting
to
get
that
malt
liquor
profile
in
my
mind
again
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
spicy
tingly
finish
drinkability
is
high
overall
i
didnt
see
saison
anywhere
on
the
can
so
there
is
a
possibility
surly
wasnt
even
trying
to
create
a
saison
regardless
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
an
amazing
fizzy
yellow
beer
hence
the
title
a
mediocre
saison
a
light
amber
body
with
a
bit
of
a
golden
tint
sits
beneath
an
ecru
cap
that
rose
a
good
two
fingers
good
retention
with
tons
of
clingy
lace
the
nose
is
floral
and
spicy
white
pepper
and
clove
with
a
little
belgian
yeast
tangfunk
earthy
undertones
on
the
palate
this
guy
slides
right
in
floral
spicy
notes
up
front
some
mild
fruity
esters
pear
and
apple
from
the
yeast
with
pine
and
earth
underneath
some
cracked
grains
through
the
middle
leading
to
a
dry
finish
of
spice
and
floralearthy
hops
light
to
medium
body
good
feel
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
saison
the
flavors
all
work
well
together
good
body
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
but
never
really
gets
in
the
way
solid
across
the
board
will
gladly
have
this
guy
in
my
glass
again
overall
a
highly
underrated
saison
o
this
might
be
the
easiest
drinking
saison
that
i
have
tried
and
it
comes
with
the
bonus
of
being
in
a
can
there
is
very
light
dryness
especially
compared
to
others
in
the
style
and
good
flavors
quite
enjoyable
and
just
shy
of
sessionable
a
little
too
strong
in
abv
to
be
truly
sessionable
but
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
good
saison
final
thoughts
this
one
is
geared
more
towards
the
bmc
crowd
although
maybe
not
intentionally
i
wonder
why
this
is
brewed
yearround
would
i
drink
it
again
no
hell
bitter
brewer
and
surlyfest
are
much
better
options
close
to
this
style
if
youre
in
the
mood
to
get
surly
this
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
it
had
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
with
a
good
retention
and
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
subtle
fruit
and
spice
notes
to
it
there
is
an
aroma
of
fresh
grain
as
well
with
a
mellow
sweetness
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
light
refreshing
and
doesnt
really
show
its
true
colors
till
the
aftertaste
the
settling
flavors
of
the
earthy
hops
and
the
black
pepper
notes
shine
bright
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
smooth
and
clean
feeling
leaving
behind
some
stickiness
in
the
mouth
afterward
overall
i
didnt
know
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
saison
but
i
could
definitely
make
that
assumption
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
o
yet
again
surly
delivers
the
attributes
of
the
style
offering
a
solid
dose
of
flavour
and
a
unique
fruity
twist
flavourful
and
drinkable
this
is
a
brew
that
i
could
drink
all
night
and
im
certain
many
would
agree
do
yourself
a
favour
and
grab
a
can
o
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
with
its
own
surly
character
this
would
be
a
go
to
sessioner
were
it
available
in
my
hood
im
not
really
big
on
farmhouse
styles
i
could
take
them
or
leave
them
but
this
was
most
enjoyable
drinkability
it
does
not
blow
me
away
but
it
is
a
very
wellcrafted
brew
enticing
nose
great
flavor
and
excellent
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
drinkable
goes
well
with
poutine
would
go
well
with
other
foods
with
subtle
flavors
a
decent
enough
beer
but
not
really
up
my
alley
would
be
cool
to
have
this
with
just
a
touch
of
the
traditional
american
hops
taste
added
to
it
eh
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
surly
has
so
many
better
offerings
i
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
cost
8
99
for
a
four
pack
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
saison
it
is
crisp
and
easy
drinking
with
a
pleasant
uplifting
level
of
carbonation
that
is
spritzy
throughout
the
entire
duration
fans
of
saisons
need
to
give
this
one
a
try
o
4
hm
bit
of
a
disappointment
to
me
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
smallish
offwhite
foamy
head
that
quickly
subsided
to
a
large
island
and
ring
with
almost
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
one
bubble
trail
aroma
is
yeast
malt
grass
caramel
flavors
similar
to
nose
a
little
too
sweet
for
style
and
sweet
up
front
some
carbonic
tang
and
yeasthop
bitter
body
and
carbonation
are
ok
finish
is
like
flavor
kind
of
long
and
again
too
sweet
couldnt
finish
it
not
for
me
one
of
the
smoothest
drinks
ive
had
in
some
time
some
may
lament
the
lack
of
high
carbonation
and
hops
often
found
in
saisons
but
i
think
it
only
enhances
the
drinkability
and
makes
this
one
a
great
tasting
beer
just
one
of
many
fantastic
beers
from
surly
oa
wonderful
saison
not
the
best
one
but
a
solid
one
indeed
with
a
few
more
surly
beers
to
go
from
a
trade
im
starting
to
see
why
everyone
is
so
high
on
this
brewery
i
like
this
one
in
that
it
leans
towards
the
hop
side
of
the
spectrum
of
saison
instead
of
the
spiced
side
o
not
too
shabby
the
canned
format
gets
bonus
points
but
im
not
sure
id
love
drinking
a
saison
straight
out
of
the
can
one
of
the
better
domestic
examples
of
the
style
ive
tried
though
lacking
in
the
floral
notes
or
intensity
of
the
best
saisons
the
surly
cult
was
not
founded
without
reason
o
solid
nothing
spectacular
the
smell
got
me
really
excited
that
it
would
be
a
bit
more
balanced
in
taste
but
its
a
pretty
regular
but
good
saison
overall
nice
saison
interesting
blend
of
yeast
fruit
and
spice
really
nice
balance
with
this
one
good
one
for
an
introduction
to
this
style
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
mentioned
above
i
really
enjoyed
the
peachy
taste
near
the
end
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
less
sweet
and
lighter
and
more
refreshing
in
mouth
feel
the
beer
is
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
leaves
some
random
spots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
oranges
spice
lemon
grass
dank
hops
lemon
zest
malt
light
in
body
this
is
easy
drinking
while
i
would
not
put
it
on
par
with
the
better
authentic
belgian
saisons
this
is
a
solid
brew
refreshing
and
enjoyable
another
solid
offering
from
surly
this
is
a
very
tasty
saison
with
a
nice
pepper
kick
i
was
told
by
a
friend
who
is
a
lot
closer
to
mn
to
not
bother
with
this
one
and
almost
listened
since
i
ended
up
placing
an
order
form
a
company
that
also
had
it
i
figured
what
the
heck
surly
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
so
i
picked
up
a
4pack
i
am
not
at
all
disappointed
i
think
its
a
great
saison
even
though
a
bit
one
sided
with
the
pepper
kick
its
still
very
refreshing
and
very
tasty
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
cans
on
hot
summer
days
a
good
saison
the
bubble
gum
phenols
make
this
one
stand
out
a
bit
but
other
wise
very
much
stock
saison
flavor
a
clean
good
ale
and
represents
the
style
well
worth
a
try
a
good
basic
saison
nothing
that
sets
apart
pours
a
slightly
hazy
peach
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
smell
is
very
yeasty
funky
with
a
light
tropical
fruit
sweetness
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
lots
of
yeast
plus
a
bit
of
pepper
and
slightly
sweet
malts
smooth
crisp
light
body
medium
carbonation
and
dry
finish
i
was
expecting
a
hoppy
ipa
style
beer
ill
have
to
start
reading
the
description
but
it
was
a
nice
surprise
bready
malty
spicy
hints
of
banana
finishes
mildly
hoppy
with
lingering
bitterness
flavor
profile
is
quite
mild
for
a
saison
almost
as
though
they
blended
a
fullflavored
saison
with
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
great
weird
example
of
the
style
just
what
youd
expect
from
surly
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
light
cracker
malt
peach
and
apple
black
pepper
bitter
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
lots
of
yeasty
esters
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
fairly
dry
quite
refreshing
i
really
enjoyed
this
surprisingly
nuanced
saison
in
a
can
o
easy
drinkin
and
tasty
just
not
quite
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
overall
it
comes
off
just
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
but
good
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
had
and
not
one
i
would
seek
out
o
a
very
good
saison
definitely
worth
seeking
out

and
drinkable

this
is
an
awesome
saison
im
not
big
on
the
style
ive
never
had
one
i
thought
was
bad
but
this
style
never
excited
me
i
feel
like
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
would
like
to
get
this
again
and
might
actively
seek
this
out
in
a
trade
with
some
furious
of
course
if
you
get
a
chance
try
this
164th
o
i
would
drink
this
again
but
it
feels
and
tastes
more
like
a
tripel
and
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
my
personal
preferences
a
saison
in
a
can
and
its
awesome
done
to
almost
near
perfection
dont
pass
this
one
up
even
though
i
can
see
it
being
overshadowed
by
their
hoppy
offerings
o
this
is
my
first
saisonfarmhouse
ale
and
i
am
really
enjoying
it
definetely
a
style
i
need
to
dive
heads
first
in
hope
places
around
me
have
similar
brews
comparable
to
this
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
a
refreshing
delicous
craft
brew
on

at
old
chicago
poured

background
of
biscuit
malt
medium
heavy
body
holds
together
well
carbonation
imparts
a
nice
crispness
very
enjoyable
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
o
its
nice
surly
didnt
stray
to
far
from
the
mold
with
this
one
but
it
tastes
good
its
quaffable
and
its
offered
in
a
great
format
pint
can
awesomeness
tastes
like
a
winner
overall
if
the
carbonation
was
tighter
and
more
rabid
and
there
was
a
touch
of
tartness
this
would
be
a
perfect
saison
but
those
two
key
components
were
lacking
and
thus
it
missed
the
mark
for
me
overall
not
bad
similar
to
most
saison
farmhouse
ales
but
a
little
light
is
a
few
categories
tasty
and
drinkable
nothing
really
wrong
per
se
but
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
and
nothing
that
really
stands
out
and
ive
been
drinking
lots
of
saisons
this
year
dr
very
drinkable
but
innovative
for
the
style
a
unique
take
on
the
style
that
id
have
again
lovely
on
draught
o
very
good
drinkability
light
with
good
flavors
a
nice
accompaniment
to
food

this

everything

nice
beer
not
a

a
great
american
take

on
the
fence
between
thinking
all
the
flavors
come
together
quite
nicely
and
thinking
it
was
a
mess
o
i
like
it
pretty
well
but
its
not
my
favorite
saison
o
a
solid

o
this

nothing

it
does

all

one
more

for
a

its
a
pretty
unique
beer
in
its
own
right
but
in
a
very
good
way
its
sweetspiciness
flavor
will
be
offputting
to
some
but
those
looking
for
a
slightly
different
kind
of
beer
should
try
this
out
o
a
nice
saison
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
high
level
complexity
that
i
enjoy
in
other
saisons
i
am
happy
that
i
still
have
three
cans
and
probably
will
hide
one
away
to
see
how
it
ages
im
a
big
fan
of
farmhouse
alessaisons
and
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
this
beer
is
very
aggressive
in
coriander
flavor
i
never
been
a
fan
of
coriander
and
this
feels
over
the
top
to
me
the
beer
itself
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
does
not
taste
like
a
saison
more
of
an
american
version
not
impressed
surly
makes
a
great
ipa
so
far
nothing
else
o
im
really
starting
to
get
into
this
funky
farmhouse
style
and
this
had
just
the
right
sweetness
to
keep
it
drinkable
for
a
newbie
like
me
like
i
said
i
would
never
have
put
this
beer
on
a
list
of
top
surly
wants
as
it
stands
though
i
love
it
i
guess
thats
the
power
of
trading
thanks
again
brian
d
saison
in
a
can
and
a
damn
good
one
id
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
were
in
surly
territory
d
really
easy
to
drink
balanced
well
and
tasty
but
is
a
little
less
complex
than
some
of
my
favorite
saisons
this
one
is
certainly
good
but
doesnt
hold
up
in
comparison
to
many
others
in
the
style
i
think
i
had
my
hopes
up
a
bit
but
was
slightly
let
down
o
overall
a
great
everyday
saison
not
the
best
in
show
nor
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
an
appropriately
priced
saison
that
would
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
but
for
surlys
limited
distribution
well
done
on
this
overall
i
really
liked
the
herbal
notes
in
this
one
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
was
a
bit
much
but
i
still
really
liked
it
i
would
have
another
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
just
where
it
should
be
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
about
average
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
after
a
day
outside
makes
it
very
easy
to
relax
and
it
all
goes
down
so
easily
and
the
flavor
complexity
is
great
o
a
fun
take
on
the
style
the
plasticy
element
of
the
flavors
are
a
detraction
for
me
but
it
is
pleasantly
complex
worth
a
shot
nice
extra
from
mnbearsfan
poured
into
a
pint
glass
golden
clear
typical
surly
carbonation
not
spectacular
but
good
looking
the
aromas
are
familiar
some
farmhouse
aroma
a
little
estery
banana
some
clove
and
spice
and
faintly
hoppy
a
very
pleasant
experience
for
my
nose
the
flavor
is
rather
nice
it
is
round
and
soft
it
is
fruity
slightly
musty
and
has
some
bubblegum
banana
and
clove
very
yeast
driven
flavors
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
citrus
flavor
dry
but
sadly
just
not
dry
enough
for
the
style
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
it
is
such
a
hard
style
and
a
saturated
style
too
id
seek
it
out
again
and
soon
overall
what
a
wonderful
beer
it
is
a
great
beer
year
round
i
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
its
a
great
beer
for
baking
beer
bread
or
beer
cheese
soup
d
this
seemed
different
than
most
saisons
i
have
tried
more
fruity
and
less
saisony
worth
a
shot
but
i
will
go
for
some
other
surly
offering
next
time
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
must
have
in
the
end
its
really
a
boring
saison
maybe
having
several
stillwater
saisons
has
ruined
me
either
way
for
as
long
as
this
has
been
a
want
im
left
unsatisfied
i
have
to
say
a
canned
saison
is
something
ive
never
experienced
before
cynicales
an
interesting
brew
that
makes
use
of
a
myriad
of
international
ingredients
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
o
sessionable
saison
in
a
can
yes
please
great
summertime
beer
id
very
much
like
a
steady
supply
of
this
o
overall
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
surly
yearround
lineup
great
flavor
profile
and
creamy
mouthfeel
ill
get
this
whenever
i
can
o
a
saison
that
can
both
be
sessioned
or
sipped
and
decoded
through
savoring
for
a
saison
that
comes
in

pack
cans
this
is
damned
good
light
bodied
with
a
decent
about
of
prickly
carbonation
just
enough
to
help
keep
the
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
solid
beer
overall
from
appearance
to
mouth
feel
cynicale
is
in
my
opinion
a
standout
beer
in
its
style
it
has
a
ridiculously
awesome
look
and
creaminess
about
it
that
remains
unseen
in
many
saisons
the
flavors
arent
overpowering
nor
too
subtle
to
remain
hoping
for
me
simply
put
the
balance
of
all
components
of
this
beer
are
really
wonderful
overallcrisp
and
refreshing
under
7
saison
not
too
filling
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
and
surly
is
yet
to
dissapoint
overall
this
is
a
decent
saison
i
like
the
use
of
oats
but
the
huge
yeast
phenolics
keep
this
beer
from
realizing
its
full
potential
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
o
this
beer
is
goes
down
very
easily
due
to
the
lack
of
dryness
and
strong
spicy
flavors
i
would
have
no
problem
having
more
than
one
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
beer
actually
seems
to
be
somewhat
thirst
quenching
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
love
what
surly
is
doing
and
have
achieved
with
this
saison
in
a
can
the
spicy
flavours
work
really
well
with
the
malt
and
fruit
o
bready
side
of
the
style
o
its
a
different
take
on
a
saison
its
quite
good
the
pepper
was
a
bit
surprising
it
has
the
spiciness
and
overall
refreshing
quality
theres
just
something
a
bit
different
to
this
one
o
liked
this
one
a
lot
another
fine
offering
from
surly
or
maybe
im
just
being
cynical
and
should
go
back
to
eating
ice
cream
o
the
more
i
got
into
it
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
very
well
made
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
in
general
but
weak
sauce
for
the
style
in
fact
when
i
first
smelled
and
tasted
it
i
thought
it
was
a
bitter
with
a
little
yeasty
spice
only
to
find
out
that
its
categorized
as
a
saison
overall
the
blast
of
pepper
is
difficult
for
me
to
overcome
or
at
least
difficult
for
me
to
overcome
and
give
it
a
rockstar
rating
i
like
this
beer
and
appreciate
the
different
components
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
another
fantastic
offering
from
surly
i
seriously
love
this
brewery
o
i
really
like
this
brew
its
grown
on
me
after
a
few
tastings
and
i
think
its
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
a
delicious
beer
not
an
astounding
example
of
the
farmhouse
style
but
something
i
will
continue
to
purchase
overall
a
good
beer
but
maybe
not
to
style
for
a
saisonsaison
on
roids
would
be
closer
but
thats
the
direction
of
surly
not
my
favorite
of
the
surly
beers
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
overall
very
good
drinkable
beer
not
quite
worth
all
of
the
fuss
that
i
have
heard
about
it
but
i
would
drink
it
again
mmmm
hits
most
of
the
right
spots
for
a
saison
grainy
grassy
and
bready
this
is
the
best
americanbrewed
saison
i
have
ever
had
it
is
missing
some
farmhouse
that
i
find
so
appealing
in
a
saison
dupont
and
of
course
to
a
greater
degree
fantome
but
damn
this
is
as
close
as
you
can
get
without
going
open
fermentation
here
in
the
states
surly
has
cranked
out
some
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
and
deserve
to
be
ranked
amongst
the
elite
brewers
in
america
most
impressive
young
jedi
o
good
example
of
the
style
this
isnt
on
the
level
of
dupont
or
anything
like
that
but
if
given
the
chance
i
would
buy
this
over
and
over
very
pleasing
and
well
rounded
with
a
lot
of
complexity
just
how
i
love
my
saisons
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
a
bit
of
work
to
do
to
take
this
into
the
territory
occupied
by
the
best
slightly
hoppy
a
little
grapefruit
easy
drinking
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
could
lead
to
trouble
as
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
pours
a
lightly
hazed
gold
color
with
faint
orange
touches
big
frothy
bubbly
head
long
lasting
scent
is
bold
fresh
baked
bread
yeasty
with
herb
and
peppery
spice
notes
touches
of
light
watery
floral
fruit
peeks
through
taste
is
a
big
punch
of
yeast
and
spice
as
tongue
adjusts
the
notes
of
grain
herbs
watery
fruit
flower
poke
through
only
thing
missing
is
the
earthy
and
funky
notes
i
prefer
in
the
style
in
the
end
it
compares
in
profile
to
some
other
belgian
styles
body
is
tremendously
creamy
for
the
style
with
faint
graininess
active
carbonation
subsides
quickly
maybe
a
bit
too
quickly
dry
and
lingering
pepper
and
yeast
notes
very
nice
beer
bold
with
some
original
qualities
o
a
really
nice
brew
that
i
think
treads
the
line
between
saison
and
belgian
pale
ale
it
has
the
fruity
lightly
funky
character
of
both
styles
with
a
tiny
bit
of
peppery
flavor
to
push
it
a
little
more
toward
saison
but
all
in
all
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
think
the
best
of
the
surly
lineup
mouthfeel
strange
for
a
farmhouse
again
light
crisp
medium
body
drinkable
thats
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
for
coming
out
of
a
can
but
it
finishes
too
strong
on
the
peppery
spice
for
me
it
isnt
bad
but
not
one
i
see
myself
drinking
very
much
o
initially
the
nose
gave
me
reservations
but
this
one
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
fantastic
its
great
to
finally
sample
one
of
my
favorite
styles
brewed
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
an
interesting
saison
and
will
certainly
be
returning
to
this
one
and
its
in
a
can
o
i
could
have
10
of
these
in
a
row
based
solely
on
the
feel
and
how
easily
it
would
quench
my
thirst
the
tartness
is
mild
and
welcome
though
i
think
i
could
only
take
down
about
2
of
these
before
wanting
something
with
more
flavor
to
it
a
good
way
to
stay
cool
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
lacks
that
pop
from
the
spices
despite
a
nice
rich
flavor
from
the
tart
fruits
inside
pours
a
clear
light
orangeyellow
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
random
chunks
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
grains
spices
and
belgian
yeast
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
with
the
belgian
yeast
taking
prominence
and
the
grain
and
spice
flavors
coming
through
on
the
finish
reading
the
can
i
see
that
the
hops
are
supposed
to
impart
apricotpeach
flavors
and
i
do
get
them
if
i
search
for
it
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
but
seems
a
tiny
bit
flat
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
from
surly
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
poured
into
my
surly
pint
glass
courtesy
of
theduderules
pours
a
apple
juice
color
with
a
little
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
the
aroma
is
great
belgian
yeast
fruity
and
a
little
funk
taste
is
amazing
everything
from
the
nose
only
intensified
and
a
peppery
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
saison
if
i
lived
in
surly
land
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
side
note
do
not
eat
with
korean
food
or
very
flavorful
meats
haha
had
the
first
half
as
i
was
cooking
it
was
going
fine
but
then
i
drank
the
rest
with
my
meal
and
it
went
downhill
the
food
killed
the
taste
and
it
started
tasting
a
lil
watery
wouldnt
really
accompany
this
with
any
food
imo
maybe
some
light
cheese
the
mouthfeel
is
fuller
and
more
lucious
than
most
saisons
i
have
had
recently
the
carbonation
also
is
not
as
in
your
face
like
most
tradional
belgian
examples
yet
still
finishes
crisp
and
on
the
dryer
side
overall
this
is
a
nice
american
interpretation
of
the
style
which
i
prefer
to
the
traditional
examples
but
that
is
personal
preference
highly
recommended
for
lovers
of
this
style
of
which
i
am
not
but
this
may
make
me
one
im
very
impressed
yet
again
by
surly
im
looking
forward
to
having
the
rest
of
the
four
pack
at
a
barbecue
tomorrow
overall
very
good
farmhouse
ale
a
lot
of
great
flavor
funk
and
carbonation
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
with
much
more
flavor
than
a
beer
that
swill
drinkers
would
want
maybe
a
good
beer
for
someone
to
start
trying
micro
brews
o
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
i
do
know
its
not
a
style
of
beer
i
usually
go
for
but
can
appreciate
the
appearance
and
the
fruity
smooth
taste
of
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
to
a
person
who
likes
this
type
of
beer
for
sure
o
i
am
beginning
to
love
saisons
i
have
had
this
a
couple
times
and
it
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
very
complex
beer
that
i
could
sip
on
for
a
while
surly
makes
me
wish
i
lived
in
minnesota
sometime
o
pretty
good
not
had
a
bad
brew
from
surly
this
was
no
different
o
a
great
tasting
well
made
beer
but
i
prefer
other
saisons
to
this
one
wont
mind
having
it
around
for
regular
consumption
though
pours
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
as
the
can
says
it
is
a
yellow
fizzy
beer
well
not
really
but
it
is
golden
and
fluffy
didnt
get
much
smell
off
this
one
not
trying
to
be
lazy
but
smells
like
a
saison
beer
with
no
overwhelming
scents
coming
through
taste
is
much
better
than
the
smell
some
great
sweet
fruitiness
with
some
spice
and
yeast
in
the
mix
with
a
little
funky
flavor
mouth
is
all
about
the
carbonation
which
is
quite
nice
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
this
is
a
different
but
nice
and
easy
drinking
saison
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
put
just
one
season
on
this
guy
i
could
drink
this
any
time
nice
work
again
surly
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
really
nicely
balanced
a
nice
american
take
on
the
saison
style
the
flavors
are
all
there
and
could
have
been
just
a
touch
stronger
a
light
refreshing
belgian
lemony
and
nice
good
spice
and
balanced
great
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
my
scores
will
reflect
this
can
o
what
can
i
say
another
solid
beer
from
surly
i
feel
like
this
one
is
a
little
under
rated
very
refreshing
quality
saison
another
beer
that
seems
to
benefit
from
some
homerism
totally
lacking
in
complexity
barely
made
up
for
in
its
simplicity
and
drinkability
notes
of
sweet
stone
fruit
emit
i
pick
up
some
cut
grass
mixed
in
there
as
well
farmhouse
funk
but
not
overly
light
and
refreshing
is
my
overall
impression
fizzy
is
best
way
to
describe
the
carbonation
peach
and
black
pepper
are
here
and
they
play
well
together
this
beer
is
very
light
and
easy
drinking
to
me
this
16oz
four
pack
is
goin
down
to
china
town
a
great
summertime
brew
o
i
liked
this
beer
i
really
did
it
is
very
good
representation
of
the
style
and
brings
a
lot
to
the
table
in
the
way
of
flavor
not
sure
if
being
in
the
can
for
5
or
6
weeks
whichever
it
actually
is
had
any
effect
on
the
aromas
or
the
taste
but
i
certainly
expected
more
in
the
aroma
department
from
surly
that
being
said
the
taste
of
this
brew
more
than
made
up
for
the
smell
chalk
up
another
success
for
surly
brewing
d
cynicale
feels
a
bit
too
symplistic
for
the
style
but
i
think
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
o
to
me
the
benchmark
on
a
saison
is
hennepin
and
this
beer
did
a
nice
job
of
capturing
a
lot
of
what
i
like
in
that
beer
probably
shouldve
drank
this
one
a
bit
fresher
since
the
canned
on
date
is
about
3
months
ago
but
i
am
still
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
and
the
beer
in
general
i
wonder
if
the
flavors
would
be
more
pronounced
or
what
the
beer
has
lost
over
time
but
it
is
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
another
winner
from
surly
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
head
settles
into
about
a
14
inch
thick
and
persists
throughout
aroma
is
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
yeast
spice
lemon
zest
apples
apricots
some
horseblanket
funk
pale
grainy
malts
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
follows
the
nose
grainy
bready
slightly
funky
bright
fruity
finishes
with
a
peppery
yeasty
funk
cant
get
enough
of
this
brewery
and
this
beer
well
puttogether
saision
o
pretty
good
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
bolder
i
would
have
liked
it
a
lot
more
but
they
seemed
slightly
weak
a
solid
brew
i
would
love
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
hanging
out
with
friends
good
for
bbqs
and
horseshoes
for
those
of
you
that
like
to
play
around
with
blending
beerstry
blending
cynic
with
benderits
awesome
do
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
for
sure
this
would
be
a
great
beer
after
dinner
on
a
warm
summer
night
another
hit
from
surly
o
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
my
favorite
saison
but
this
holds
its
own
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
and
flavor
of
some
of
my
personal
favorites
nice
summer
beer
the
cpj
medium
body
higher
carbonation
refreshing
and
invigorating
on
the
senses
drinks
nice
solid
balance
between
fruit
and
spice
and
the
hop
profile
makes
this
something
id
drink
often
during
warmer
weather
overall
a
very
good
interpretation
of
a
belgian
ale
o
if
i
find
this
again
its
a
buy
for
sure
o
not
a
bad
saison
but
not
great
either
the
body
is
a
bit
weak
and
the
flavors
somewhat
bland
d
wow
this
is
the
most
drinkable
saison
i
have
ever
had
fantastic
flavor
is
met
with
a
refreshing
tasting
the
brew
is
so
full
of
livliness
and
flavor
wow
props
to
surly
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
suddenly
gets
thin
and
crisp
midway
through
each
sip
it
happens
to
be
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
slight
chalk
during
the
yeasty
portions
kind
of
intrudes
on
both
separate
mouthfeels
but
is
nice
by
itself
drinkability
is
helped
by
the
change
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
as
lighter
fruits
make
for
an
easier
drinker
from
a
can
into
glass
just
like
they
told
me
to
do
pour
results
in
a
full
bonecolored
head
topping
a
clear
goldencolored
beer
with
active
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
oats
and
yeast
complex
and
spicy
at
the
outset
it
mellows
beautifully
with
each
drink
its
pretty
aggressive
for
a
saison
though
i
did
enjoy
it
with
my
meal
its
smooth
and
eminently
drinkable
overall
if
youre
not
looking
for
the
subtle
saison
you
would
be
very
happy
to
have
it
as
a
table
beer
overall
a
nice
belgian
choice
im
not
a
belgian
purist
or
expert
but
this
is
a
tasty
rendition
of
the
style
and
is
very
appealing
on
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
maybe
not
the
best
but
definitely
good
i
hate
to
be
harsh
but
the
americanized
hoppy
saison
just
doesnt
work
for
me
its
a
clash
of
flavors
that
just
tastes
like
a
mess
o
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
saison
really
smells
like
one
but
taste
is
definitely
an
american
take
with
belgian
yeast
it
really
works
well
though
ive
seen
and
tasted
plenty
of
failures
in
trying
new
takes
this
is
not
one
of
them
a
must
try
overall
this
is
a
lovely
beer
indeed
and
id
happily
pick
up
a
sixer
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
i
love
that
its
in
16
oz
cans
too
i
find
this
beer
good
but
rather
unremarkable
i
like
the
spicy
aroma
but
the
flavor
is
a
letdown
thats
a
first
for
me
with
surly
it
tastes
good
but
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
to
it
d
as
with
all
surly
easily
drinkable
and
love
the
cans
just
think
there
are
better
surlys
out
there
to
enjoy
drinkability
is
moderately
high
not
my
favorite
saison
but
the
flavors
are
pleasant
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
honestly
this
is
probably
the
only
saison
i
know
of
thats
canned
so
for
hot
summer
days
on
the
beach
this
would
be
a
nice
can
to
pack
in
the
cooler
for
those
locales
that
dont
approve
of
bottles
not
my
favorite
saison
of
all
time
but
a
pretty
solid
beer
6
7
abv
yeaaa
right
seems
no
more
than
5
until
you
drink
a
pint
of
it
i
love
the
idea
of
saison
in
a
can
this
would
make
a
phenomenal
beach
beer
it
would
definitely
be
a
summer
staple
in
my
fridge
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
hard
to
come
by
outside
of
minnesota
i
realized
a
little
more
than
halfway
into
this
one
that
i
should
have
poured
it
harder
as
its
gassy
to
the
point
where
its
difficult
to
drink
after
a
few
good
swirls
in
my
glass
it
was
less
prickly
and
easier
to
drink
d
a
really
solid
saison
that
i
could
easily
drink
over
and
over
again
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
if
you
like
saisons
then
you
should
too
thanks
again
chris
d
very
good
example
of
a
saison
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
lot
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
tons
of
whit
frothy
head
geat
head
retension
and
beautiful
lacing
smells
peppery
and
floral
a
nice
light
malt
profile
with
lots
of
yeasty
smells
tastes
sweet
and
malty
pepper
hits
hard
and
the
floral
flavours
meld
well
good
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
cheers
on
the
other
hand
that
lightness
combined
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
some
lively
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
really
good
i
could
have
a
few
cans
the
6
7
alcohol
isnt
even
noticeable
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
very
good
great
idea
to
can
a
farmhouse
this
is
an
excellent
crossover
to
craft
ales
for
a
macro
lager
drinker
im
ready
for
summer
bbq
season
now
pours
a
slight
hazy
blonde
with
a
small
tight
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
some
peach
and
citrus
flavor
is
good
and
spicy
with
some
earthy
hops
and
some
citrus
overall
it
is
quite
dry
this
is
one
of
the
more
americanized
saisons
i
have
had
not
that
that
makes
it
any
less
tasty
its
just
pretty
gosh
darned
domesticated
a
really
nice
saison
one
of
the
few
beers
where
the
discription
on
the
can
nearly
perfectly
matches
what
you
actually
taste
its
not
a
dupont
nor
is
there
anythinf
remotely
aproaching
anything
wild
in
this
beer
its
just
a
really
nice
if
slightly
diferent
example
d
its
all
right
not
the
best
of
the
style
or
from
this
brewery
color
is
wonderfulan
amberhued
pale
yellow
number
almost
like
a
color
youd
see
on
a
1975
lincoln
continental
thankfully
the
can
has
far
less
metal
than
the
car
but
the
beer
will
take
you
much
further
reasonable
it
feels
like
a
good
standard
probably
more
of
a
summer
beer
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
but
it
still
lands
on
solid
ground
in
its
style
id
like
to
see
a
lower
abv
though
i
think
i
like
surly
come
to
tn
please
d
drinks
clean
and
quickly
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
lingering
sweet
orange
and
coriander
d
this
was
the
last
of
my
surly
cans
i
wasnt
as
excited
for
it
as
i
was
for
coffee
bender
and
the
rest
i
guess
the
middle
of
january
isnt
the
saison
rimshot
this
turned
out
to
be
a
stellar
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
d
a
decent
beer
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
surly
sort
of
surlys
interpretation
of
an
everyday
drinker
i
didnt
realize
this
one
was
categorized
as
a
saison
until
i
looked
up
the
review
and
im
more
than
a
bit
surprised
as
this
beer
simply
doesnt
remind
me
of
what
a
saison
should
be
drink
i
am
amazed
this
came
out
of
a
can
i
am
very
happy
i
have
four
of
them
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
the
yeasty
flavor
more
upfront
once
it
warmed
a
bit
i
also
picked
up
some
pepper
an
ever
so
slight
amount
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
that
being
said
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
considering
how
good
it
is
given
the
chance
i
would
surly
is
pretty
well
known
for
their
hopbomb
furious
so
this
is
pretty
different
from
what
i
have
had
from
them
bender
furious
smoke
but
it
brings
a
roundness
to
their
beer
offerings
i
normally
like
a
dark
beer
or
ipa
but
if
anyone
wanted
a
sweeter
easy
drinker
i
would
probably
recommend
this
one
thanks
to
brewnic
for
this
one
i
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
a
snifter
the
pour
is
hazy
orange
with
a
fizzy
little
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
citrusy
even
some
peaches
the
beer
is
spicy
and
zesty
it
has
a
very
drying
sharp
finish
the
beer
is
light
and
well
carbonated
a
damn
fine
saison
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
amazing
surly
does
it
again
and
again
really
good
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
amazing
it
has
a
lot
going
on
hints
of
clove
hints
of
banana
a
little
band
aid
bubble
gum
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
aroma
it
makes
it
a
very
fun
beer
the
taste
is
very
complex
as
well
it
is
sweet
bready
bubblegum
slight
banana
flavor
it
is
a
very
complex
delicious
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
at
the
same
time
the
flavors
and
aroma
that
come
out
of
this
beer
are
so
complex
this
is
a
very
good
beer
drank
out
of
mug
it
had
a
1
finger
white
head
and
was
the
color
of
honey
had
a
nice
alehopscitrus
aroma
the
carbonation
was
lowmedium
it
tastes
like
a
good
ale
nothing
outstanding
just
a
good
brew
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
slight
hopbitter
taste
on
the
end
d
great
beer
very
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
ideal
for
summer
medium
bodied
with
hints
of
honey
floral
notes
light
crisp
fruit
such
as
apple
pear
apricot
and
peach
slightly
spicy
with
hints
of
pepper
and
lemon
zest
as
well
as
a
subtle
hop
presence
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
dry
finish
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
surprising
considering
how
unimpressive
the
appearance
and
nose
were
but
i
would
pass
on
this
one
again
by
far
my
favorite
saison
so
far
i
have
a
couple
others
in
the
fridge
that
im
even
more
excited
to
try
now
cynicale
is
very
good
in
the
flavor
department
but
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
i
expected
because
it
isnt
as
dry
as
i
expected
this
does
not
diminish
the
other
excellent
qualities
this
beer
possesses
poured
from
the
can
into
a
shaped
pint
glass
with
a
goldenhoney
colored
body
with
a
finger
of
white
light
head
that
fades
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
in
the
glass
smells
of
grass
citrus
barnyard
and
typical
belgian
spice
taste
is
lemony
and
spicy
right
away
nectarines
golden
delicious
apples
and
sugar
come
in
to
play
a
bready
yeast
with
clove
and
coriander
fade
to
horse
blanket
which
rounds
out
the
flavors
feels
light
and
crisp
with
the
medium
to
high
carbonation
id
expect
light
in
booze
and
big
on
flavor
this
may
have
just
edged
out
my
previous
favorite
of
hennepin
drinkability
is
great
dryness
combined
with
the
flavor
make
this
a
super
drinkable
beer
drinkability
recommended
perhaps
a
skosh
fruitier
and
sweeter
than
most
but
overall
a
rather
tasty
beer
and
a
very
enjoyable
saison
from
surly
darkness
is
a
fine
treat
now
and
again
but
i
think
id
prefer
to
have
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
is
an
old
can
has
over
1
5
years
on
it
saisons
hold
up
well
but
the
flavor
is
fairly
muted
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
one
and
it
is
good
overall
i
need
to
try
this
again
fresh
and
rereview
when
it
is
released
i
was
a
little
heavyhanded
on
the
crack
glug
and
nearly
caused
it
to
foam
over
the
lip
of
the
glass
the
good
thing
was
that
it
netted
me
two
fingers
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
i
definitely
got
the
peach
and
apricot
notes
i
reversed
the
order
from
the
notes
on
the
can
because
it
seemed
peachy
up
front
with
the
apricot
a
lighter
scent
i
was
reminded
of
ofallons
wheach
actually
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
riot
of
flavors
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
tongue
the
honey
flavor
was
immediate
followed
by
a
fruity
mix
and
then
the
black
pepper
kicked
in
especially
on
the
finish
wow
what
a
wild
ride
omar
co
need
not
worry
about
greg
koch
co
taking
them
to
task
for
making
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
because
this
was
not
for
sissies
hell
whoops
different
surly
beer
i
would
intermingle
this
at
the
top
of
the
cooler
with
wheach
and
let
the
honey
bees
swarm
bravo
o
typical
solid
offering
from
surly
not
my
favorite
saison
but
definitely
gets
the
job
done
mouthfeel
is
good
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
especially
during
a
hot
summer
day
really
impressive
mix
of
flavors
drinkability
is
pretty
good
something
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
but
if
i
were
this
would
definitely
go
down
easy
md
mouthfeel
was
full
rich
creamy
and
smooth
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
regularly
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
this
is
the
best
belgianstyle
beer
ive
had
out
of
a
can
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
surly
very
drinkable
and
fairly
enjoyable
everything
was
spot
on
but
i
am
slightly
disappointed
with
the
flavor
while
it
was
good
i
expected
more
this
is
still
one
i
would
pick
up
every
now
and
again
if
it
were
available
to
me
huge
thanks
to
eric
gratefulbeerhead
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
vibrant
in
the
nose
but
it
is
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
theres
a
nice
pie
crust
malt
flavor
and
a
dry
somewhat
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
isnt
as
great
as
most
other
saisons
ive
had
but
it
fits
the
style
and
doesnt
hurt
it
at
all
drinkability
is
excellent
this
version
seems
a
little
more
restrained
than
most
saisons
but
that
helps
in
some
aspects
im
suprised
at
how
quick
the
16
oz
can
went
another
great
surly
d
extremely
sessionable
beer
very
easy
drinking
im
glad
this
is
a
year
round
offering
from
surly
d
pretty
darn
good
i
can
sometimes
prefer
a
more
earthymusty
saison
but
this
is
very
good
da
wonderfully
flavourful
and
easy
to
enjoy
brew
out
of
a
cooler
from
a
can
at
a
summer
bbq
or
fall
football
tailgate
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
punch
delicious
the
taste
impressed
me
a
bit
more
with
a
nice
balance
of
yeast
flavors
surprising
malt
crackery
note
and
delicate
hop
character
leading
to
a
nice
slightly
yeasty
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
with
a
great
substance
a
little
more
body
than
some
saisons
but
it
worked
here
and
still
maintained
a
crisp
carbonation
and
good
finish
i
liked
this
beer
and
though
it
wasnt
particularly
aggressive
it
was
well
balanced
and
i
could
see
picking
it
up
again
locally
if
it
were
available
md
beer
is
thickheavy
in
the
mouth
but
also
smooth
besides
the
fact
that
it
has
a
relatively
high
abv
and
the
heavieness
may
fill
you
up
it
is
a
great
session
beer
however
i
find
that
it
is
only
really
enjoyable
in
the
summer
i
was
cynical
about
how
good
this
could
be
even
though
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
brewery
i
was
wrong
this
beer
is
not
a
let
down
in
fact
i
think
it
nails
the
style
dead
on
and
retains
some
soul
and
personality
burnt
gold
with
a
white
head
that
holds
and
leaves
nice
ace
nose
is
wow
the
french
barley
is
really
nice
very
husky
and
mildly
toasty
with
a
touch
of
whole
wheatlike
sweetness
but
delicate
at
the
same
time
for
those
looking
for
funk
this
isnt
the
one
but
the
mixture
here
really
paints
a
picture
of
a
sunny
farmhouse
lot
the
hops
adding
some
serious
flower
and
fruit
mainly
peach
but
apricot
and
plucot
too
and
the
yeast
adds
a
very
subtle
and
much
less
peppery
than
some
spiciness
it
is
so
well
balanced
it
seems
like
the
smell
might
be
peach
blossomy
but
its
not
its
peach
and
wildflowers
and
earthiness
and
the
seperate
flavors
are
distinct
yet
not
muddy
at
all
really
a
great
american
saison
and
like
i
said
nails
it
for
the
style
he
must
have
read
phils
book
surly
is
creating
some
of
americas
best
beers
for
sure
keep
up
the
good
work
this
doesnt
feel
quite
like
a
saison
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
surly
set
out
to
create
an
authentic
farmhouse
ale
characteristics
of
saison
biere
de
garde
belgian
pale
and
czech
pilsner
are
present
it
is
a
hybrid
that
ends
up
being
pretty
unique
craft
in
a
can
always
makes
me
happy
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
many
thanks
to
chixdighops
for
hookin
me
up
d
personally
this
doesnt
perfectly
click
with
my
palate
but
i
would
definitely
reach
for
this
on
occasion
you
have
to
give
credit
to
a
brewery
having
an
affordable
yearround
belgian
style
ale
plus
the
can
adds
some
style
points
i
can
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
here
the
feel
is
good
light
and
direct
but
its
a
bit
filmy
on
the
end
some
bubbles
could
help
dry
this
out
just
a
tad
to
get
a
crisper
feel
and
keep
the
aftertaste
minimal
or
fresher
feeling
d
excellent
drinkability
a
ton
of
flavor
but
yet
very
dry
very
clean
very
refreshing
cynic
is
good
but
nothing
mindblowing
surly
makes
so
many
great
beers
with
many
being
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
this
is
not
one
of
them
but
its
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
saisons
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
great
example
of
the
style
nonetheless
overall
a
good
belgian
hits
the
style
very
well
almost
like
a
mini
belgian
golden
ale
was
pretty
happy
with
this
one
and
lamented
being
done
with
it
d
easy
drinking
crisp
and
refreshing
solid
for
the
style
would
definitely
drink
again
thanks
connor
for
getting
me
surly
poured
into
a
standard
pint
it
pours
a
clear
gold
color
and
when
standing
next
to
hell
it
appears
about
a
half
shade
darker
theres
a
soft
fluffy
thin
head
on
top
with
lacing
that
slides
slowly
it
smells
of
sweet
citrusy
hops
fruits
and
belgian
yeast
has
an
earthy
taste
but
i
first
noted
the
spiced
peppery
taste
from
the
yeast
its
got
a
light
malty
sweetness
but
strong
citrusy
flavors
this
lighterbodied
beer
is
actively
carbonated
and
gives
that
drying
alcohol
sensation
in
the
back
like
beer
drink
more
dthis
is
a
decent
brew
interesting
crusted
bread
flavor
not
a
ton
of
typical
saison
characteristics
tons
of
carbonation
d
a
solid
saison
that
fits
the
style
well
crisp
and
refreshing
too
i
like
the
grassy
and
spice
note
within
the
funk
a
solid
brew
d
pretty
drinkable
brew
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
surly
but
still
a
good
brew
none
the
less
i
recommend
trying
it
even
if
you
not
into
the
style
d
for
a
fraction
of
fantomes
cost
why
not
an
excellent
saison
overall
especially
for
an
american
that
is
available
yearround
if
youre
in
the
twin
cities
try
it
drinkabilty
not
a
bad
saison
i
think
that
it
could
have
benifited
from
either
a
little
more
hoppy
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
or
a
little
more
fruit
throughout
poured
from
a
16oz
can
into
a
becker
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazey
pale

color
with
good
carbonation
that
produces
a
nice

head
can
smell
some
lemon

some

nice

refreshing

this
one
really
grew
on
me
about
halfway
through
saison
in
a
can
wish
i
had
more
d
very
nice
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
as
stated
above
i
enjoyed
the
balance
of
maltfunkcitrus
in
this
beer
glad
that
i
have
been
able
to
try
all
of
these
surly
beers
i
now
know
what
i
have
been
missing
d
pretty
tasty
i
could
see
myself
doing
a
few
drinkability
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
saison
it
has
some
simple
but
good
flavors
and
isnt
intense
enough
in
any
category
to
take
away
from
its
sessionability
im
really
enjoying
this
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
time
i
get
to
try
it
thanks
kevin
i
have
been
saving
this
beer
for
awhile
now
and
once
i
decided
to
raid
my
cellar
i
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
and
is
the
second
surly
offering
i
have
had
and
their
stuff
has
been
up
to
par
so
far
drinkability
not
my
favorite
saison
but
certainly
a
solid
offering
from
surly
there
is
very
little
chance
that
you
will
find
a
better
saison
in
a
can
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
saison
and
i
woudl
definitely
buy
this
one
again
at
10
a
4pack
its
a
bit
steep
obviously
not
by
much

it
is

good
buy
d
saisons
really
arent
my
thing
but
with
that
being
said
cynicale
is
really
quite
solid
not
that
id
expect
anything
less
from
surly
great
mouthfeel
and
complexity
though
a
little
bit
dull
at
points
flavors
are
muted
to
a
point
due
to
the
odd
heaviness
of
this
one
seek
this
one
out
if
youre
not
really
into
saisons
it
might
change
your
mind
d
if
this
beer
were
about
2
to
3
abv
lighter
i
could
drink
this
all
night
maybe
im
just
getting
too
used
to
some
of
the
cleaner
american
hop
varieties
but
i
felt
the
bitterness
was
a
little
rough
on
this
beer
still
i
think
its
a
beer
that
you
should
get
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
d
this
is
a
great
saison
saison
is
one
style
that
i
have
trouble
enjoying
but
i
think
this
one
is
nicely
done
and
features
a
lot
of
unique
flavors
with
good
balance
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
head
in
comparison
to
most
saisons
the
smell
is
classic
with
that
belgium
yeast
with
honey
and
pepper
notes
then
some
clove
and
bananas
the
taste
is
citrus
and
honey
and
pepper
with
a
nice
clove
bite
with
some
oats
and
barley
this
is
really
deliciousit
has
lots
of
flavors
but
its
all
balanced
out
at
the
end
a
pleasure
for
the
taste
buds
the
mouth
fell
is
medium
but
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
crispness
this
is
very
well
done
but
no
surprise
her
it
say
surly
on
the
can
a
very
nice
and
smooth
beer
but
the
long
lasting
sweetness
and
weight
hurt
the
beers
body
in
the
end
thanks
chicksdighops
simply
amazing
that
this
much
complexity
came
out
of
a
can
i
cant
believe
it
i
never
expected
anything
like
this
as
much
flavor
if
not
more
then
some
of
the
best
belgians
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
anything
decent
from
a
can
is
awesome
to
me
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
pale
than
what
you
would
expect
from
a
saison
but
still
good
nonetheless
d
pretty
drinkable
each
sip
left
me
wanting
more
but
16
oz
was
plenty
very
pleased
with
this
beer
as
i
have
been
with
every
other
surly
beer
surly
is
slowly
creeping
its
way
up
as
my
favorite
brewery
d
surly
makes
yet
another
amazing
beer
this
seems
to
be
the
norm
with
surly
though
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
this
beer
damn
please
for
the
love
of
god
come
to
indiana
i
had
one
of
these
from
a
can
at
the
bedlam
theater
and
it
kind
of
blew
me
away
fantastic
drinkability
going
handinhand
with
a
sharp
biteyouintheass
kind
of
flavor
ive
only
had
two
beers
from
surly
and
theyve
both
seemed
like
regular
beer
but
this
ones
on
the
good
side
of
regular
dont
hesitate
to
pay
5
00
for
a
can
of
this
guy
good
drinkability
good
saison
overall
a
very
nice
beer
one
worth
seeking
out
i
know
ill
be
getting
more
thanks
to
bdlbrewster
for
hooking
me
up
with
surly
goodness
poured
from
a
can
into
my
duvel
tulip
pours
a
nice
burnt
orange
color
a
little
bit
darker
than
i
usually
expect
from
a
saison
a
nice
sized
slightly
off
white
head
forms
and
lingers
for
a
minute
before
largely
disappearing
and
leaving
behind
a
disappointing
lack
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
biscuity
malts
and
yeast
goodness
a
few
sips
bring
a
taste
that
largely
mirrors
the
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
seems
out
of
place
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
highlight
of
this
beer
theres
the
normally
slightly
prickly
carbonation
i
find
in
a
saison
but
theres
also
a
creaminess
that
takes
it
to
another
level
i
cant
say
its
my
favorite
saison
that
would
be
fresh
jack
dor
but
cynicale
is
a
damn
good
beer
d
surly
is
awesome
they
are
easily
one
of
the
most
underrated
brewers
in
the
game
and
this
brew
is
definitely
worthy
of
the
brand
bestowed
upon
the
can
overall
very
drinkable
and
interesting
brew
surly
is
always
somewhat
unique
as
they
dont
seem
to
be
beholden
to
style
constraints
i
could
see
some
people
really
loving
the
beer
personally
i
enjoy
it
but
think
it
might
be
a
bit
overpriced

d
i
heard
that
there
is
a
lot
of
variability
with
this
brew
i
think
i
got
one
of
the
duller
ones
good
but
not
great
very
good
drinkability
alcohol
well
hidden
d
who
would
have
thought
a
saison
in
a
can
a
nice
beer
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
still
a
pretty
good
american
example
of
the
style
d
ive
always
wanted
to
try
a
regular
surly
beer
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
a
stand
out
effort
skål
overall
not
your
typical
saison
to
me
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
that
was
funto
drink
16
ounce
can
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
never
thought
in
my
life
i
would
be
pouring
a
saison
out
of
a
can
totally
strange
thank
you
kindly
to
kbutler1
for
trekking
some
surly
cans
across
the
country
for
me
1
inch
of
pillowy
white
head
lingers
on
a
blondegolden
body
leaving
some
soapy
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
fruity
hoppy
and
refreshing
taste
is
of
apples
apricots
sunshine
and
a
touch
of
funk
actually
leans
more
towards
a
belgian
saison
versus
and
american
one
really
really
hard
to
believe
that
these
flavors
are
coming
out
of
an
american
can
wow
not
the
strongest
effort
from
surly
here
but
this
still
possessed
enough
flavor
and
smooth
drinkibility
to
keep
me
entertained
during
the
duration
of
this
can
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
crack
when
the
weather
gets
a
little
warmer
havent
had
many
other
saison
style
beers
to
compare
this
to
but
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
a
good
exploit
of
yeast
characters
would
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
again
pours
a
nice
orangeyellow
with
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
settles
down
quite
nicely
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
lightly
roasted
malts
subtle
spice
fruit
the
flavor
is
very
smmoth
for
a
surly
no
in
your
face
hops
but
a
nice
smooth
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
nicely
done
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
very
drinkable
for
me
its
a
great
summer
time
beer
as
well
as
i
nice
break
from
the
heavier
ris
i
have
been
drinking
lately
dont
think
i
have
had
a
saison
before
very
interesting
the
taste
is
not
quite
my
thing
but
still
very
good
everything
else
is
great
in
this
beer
drinkability
solid
enough
with
nice
flavors
i
think
if
it
came
out
of
a
bottle
the
the
head
may
have
had
a
different
appearance
that
would
be
a
little
closer
to
style
but
beyond
that
its
spot
on
i
would
gladly
stock
up
on
this
if
it
was
local
there
is
a
nice
light
hoppy
taste
with
a
lingering
bitterness
a
nice
little
bite
in
the
background
of
some
sort
of
spiciness
i
cannot
describe
very
very
good
cynicale
is
light
to
mediumbodied
but
fullflavored
the
finish
is
silky
and
longlasting
as
well
its
a
great
american
twist
on
the
style
complex
but
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
bananas
and
cloves
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
nice
the
flavor
is
bananas
with
some
spices
and
maybe
the
slightest
bit
of
funk
there
are
some
other
flavors
in
there
possibly
orange
and
bubble
gum
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
much
more
like
a
hefeweizen
or
dunkel
weizen
but
still
a
very
good
beer
thanks
man
driz
youre
a
good
man
despite
what
2tal
says
about
ya
d
overall
this
is
an
above
average
ale
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
strong
yeast
taste
to
it
and
also
a
little
citrus
not
my
favorite
surly
product
but
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
this
a
pretty
quaffable
beverage
if
you
dont
mind
the
spicy
nature
of
this
brew
as
always
surly
has
yet
to
let
me
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
tasty
and
easy
drinking
the
only
thing
that
would
stop
me
from
having
more
of
this
is
it
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
like
most
things
surly
does
though
this
is
a
very
good
beer

d
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
enough
but
its
not
really
making
me
crave
more
ive
loved
all
of
the
previous
surly
beers
ive
had
so
had
some
high
hopes
for
this
one
especially
since
i
love
saisons
too
a
good
beer
and
worth
giving
a
try
but
i
have
to
say
i
am
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
beer
the
best
saison
ever
to
come
froma
can
for
sure
d
this
is
a
great
beer
amazing
to
find
a
great
saison
in
a
can
pours
a
rich
orange
with
a
high
white
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
white
pepper
stone
fruit
jasmine
well
water
the
taste
is
sweet
black
plum
mild
malts
raw
barley
wethay
funk
pepper
in
the
finish
the
bubbles
are
fine
and
the
consistency
is
only
a
little
thick
more
suited
for
fall
than
summer
maybe
its
quite
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
at
the
style
and
goes
down
slow
and
easy
another
good
one
from
surly
d
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
cannot
believe
i
surly
continues
to
make
such
great
beers
the
can
thing
is
something
i
can
get
on
board
with
they
have
all
been
great
furious
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
but
recently
bender
and
cynicale
have
turned
me
off
slightly
from
this
brewery
though
there
not
bad
brews
they
are
just
average
and
a
bit
watery
a
decent
saison
that
is
very
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
light
funk
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
lighter
saison
d
well
if
i
was
looking
for
this
style
would
have
again
might
go
easier
to
have
belgain
ale
that
this
reminded
me
of
altough
good
it
didnt
blow
me
away
d
a
god
lighter
beer
with
nice
components
giving
it
some
good
flavor
if
it
wasnt
for
the
brilliant
clarity
and
color
though
it
would
be
good
looking
at
all
a
nice
and
drinkable
offering
from
surly
not
one
id
trade
for
again
but
big
ups
to
goldenjet
for
the
trade
overall
not
that
much
to
say
really
american
style
saison
drinkability
nice
really
a
great
beer
can
or
not
and
definately
one
to
seek
out
yet
another
reason
to
wish
i
lived
in
the
twin
cities
looking
forward
to
having
this
in
cans
at
bonnaroo
next
summer
makes
me
think
of
a
hoppy
belgian
witbier
minus
the
wheat
this
beer
had
serious
potentialhence
the
belief
it
was
bad
or
outdated
if
the
head
retained
much
longer
and
left
lace
and
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
dry
and
carbonated
sufficientlythe
whole
beer
would
score
better
as
it
was
a
major
letdown
after
reading
many
of
the
well
received
reviews
here
mouthfeel
is
moderate
beer
is
a
little
thicker
than
i
expected
but
its
still
pretty
good
drinkability
is
moderate
that
aftertaste
really
damages
this
beer
d
drinkable
as
all
hell
and
very
interesting
drinkability
ive
had
this
thing
quite
a
few
times
now
and
im
really
beginning
to
enjoy
it
i
really
enjoy
the
subtle
spicyness
of
this
easy
drinking
brew
with
just
enough
body
to
be
savored
poured
a
deep
orange
color
with
good
carbonation

no
head
to
speak
of

damn
good

into
my
pint

a
dark
hazy
orange
with
a
small
ivorycolored
head
on

leaves
very
little

smells
of
tart
apples
apricots
pineapple
and
spices
the
mouth
is
crisp
but
with
a
bit
of
subtle
creaminess
on
the
finish
i
like
that
this
is
a
hopforward
saison
for
sure
nice
bitter
earthy
hops
at
the
forefront
plenty
of
fruity
funk
in
there
as
well
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
black
pepper
spiciness
this
is
really
good
wow
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
may
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
well
done
surly
d
a
little
bit
much
to
be
too
drinkable
but
the
complexity
brought
me
back
for
more
d
it
drinks
a
bit
more
like
a
belgian
pale
but
sure
does
go
down
smooth
and
easy
another
triumph
for
surly
a
highly
drinkable
highly
sessionable
saison
overall
a
very
solid
and
interesting
saison
from
surly
who
never
seem
to
disappoint
sprightly
carbonation
that
is
not
overdone
full
gamut
of
flavors
and
smells
nice
cheekdrying
but
not
puckering
finish
refreshing
all
around
if
i
had
access
to
surly
this
would
likely
be
my
summer
drinker
of
choice
an
absolute
delight
thanks
a
ton
for
leaving
me
this
one
eric
this
is
a
good
saison
but
i
think
the
spices
are
almost
a
bit
too
much
im
not
wild
about
the
nose
either
and
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
smoother
if
you
like
your
saisons
on
the
spicy
side
you
will
absolutely
love
this
beer
id
have
it
again
but
im
not
sure
id
do
so
with
regularity
when
i
do
i
will
certainly
let
it
warm
pours
a
kind
of
deep
golden
color
moving
a
bit
towards
orange
the
head
is
huge
rocky
and
the
bubbles
pop
up
and
leave
giant
caverns
the
beer
is
hard
to
see
through
i
dont
think
its
that
hazy
but
the
bubbles
move
so
fast
its
hard
to
see
through
it
the
head
falls
down
leaving
only
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
grainy
pilsener
malt
a
tiny
bit
of
sugar
but
not
sweet
and
id
bet
there
are
other
grains
a
bit
of
tartness
a
little
lemon
maybe
some
acidity
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
earthiness
a
little
leafiness
i
think
the
taste
has
all
of
the
good
stuff
the
taste
is
a
bit
tart
a
little
acidic
no
real
presence
of
hops
maybe
a
bit
of
the
earthiness
from
saaz
but
every
taste
has
something
different
in
terms
of
grain
theres
the
grainy
powdery
pilsener
malt
the
sweet
kind
of
slick
feeling
of
oats
and
finish
of
a
little
spice
it
starts
to
feel
drier
eventually
which
i
like
this
one
is
good
the
body
is
nice
around
medium
maybe
a
little
full
for
the
style
but
theres
a
brilliant
dryness
which
really
goes
far
to
compliment
the
tartness
and
the
rush
of
carbonation
really
carries
it
all
through
no
sting
but
a
pleasant
mouthfull
id
say
this
is
easy
to
drink
though
i
think
the
abv
is
a
bit
higher
than
i
expect
for
the
style
still
i
could
enjoy
this
almost
any
time
d
excellent
example
of
the
style
not
only
is
it
american
made
but
also
from
a
can
whowouldathunk
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
a
fine
tingling
carbonation
suitable
warmweather
beer
and
plenty
of
character
to
boot
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
i
found
this
to
be
really
easy
to
drink
dark
gold
in
color
almost
a
walnut
color
frothy
head
of
foam
mild
nose
of
malt
and
faint
banana
notes
the
initial
attack
is
gentle
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
a
traditional
ale
the
flavor
goes
from
the
gentle
banana
beginning
to
giving
way
to
a
rush
of
banana
flavor
and
then
a
smooth
malt
finish
its
pretty
easy
drinking
but
way
too
much
banana
in
my
opinion
i
havent
really
found
the
saissons
that
i
have
tried
to
have
much
in
common
eventually
i
expect
that
they
will
be
widespread
enough
to
develop
some
kind
of
theme
a
good
drinkable
saison
cynicale
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
pale
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
honey
caramel
malt
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
quite
clean
for
a
saison
but
theres
still
some
farmhouse
character
in
there
the
bitterness
is
particularly
nice
on
an
otherwise
honeysweet
beer
the
feel
is
medium
light
and
appropriate
to
the
flavor
drinkability
is
quite
high
but
im
a
sucker
for
the
style
again
i
dearly
wish
that
i
could
have
easy
access
to
surlys
beers
overall
this
is
another
great
surly
beer
that
comes
in
a
can
im
still
new
to
the
whole
saison
style
so
i
need
to
get
use
to
it
a
little
bit
but
for
what
its
worth
this
represent
it
well
and
is
good
definitely
one
to
check
out
if
you
have
the
chance
too
d
in
the
end
this
is
a
top
notch
brew
might
be
improved
if
i
had
served
it
on
the
cooler
side
of
the
spectrum
many
thanks
to
mnjeff
for
the
trade
d
a
good
summer
session
beer
drinkability
great
thirst
quenching
summer
brew
with
an
abv
almost
7
that
will
sneak
up
on
you
ddefinitely
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
this
is
just
so
damn
refreshing
get
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
great
saison
that
is
offered
from
surly
i
really
enjoyed
all
the
unique
tastes
and
this
pint
will
be
gone
fast
my
mother
even
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
beer
during
the
summer
easy
to
drink
but
backs
a
ton
of
flavor
drinkibility
great
i
could
drink
the
whole
4
pack
of
cans
easily
great
session
beer
for
the
summer
great
drinkability
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
easy
to
put
several
of
these
back
overall
i
do
feel
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
the
taste
and
abv
are
not
too
much
and
although
the
mouthfeel
could
be
better
it
goes
down
fairly
lightly
making
it
easier
than
many
of
the
more
potent
beers
hmm
if
you
look
at
the
story
and
description
printed
on
the
can
this
peppery
spicy
phenolic
character
seems
to
be
what
they
were
going
for
with
that
in
mind
its
not
so
bad
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
saison
could
use
more
farmhouse
character
too
d
easy
drinkable
beer
flavors
are
smooth
and
easy
certainly
lends
themselves
as
a
summer
drink
a
golden
color
and
a
medium
body
head
a
nose
of
yeasty
protein
apricot
and
pilsner
hoppiness
i
would
say
that
is
pretty
much
the
palate
a
tad
sweet
though
not
necessarily
earthy
or
dry
not
meaty
resembled
a
pilsner
type
beer
actually
with
a
mealy
peach
fruit
and
a
bitter
finish
in
a
can
i
would
say
the
weakest
link
of
the
line
up
of
ready
available
surly
beers
in
minneapolis
that
isnt
that
big
of
an
insult
seeing
as
how
good
there
line
up
is
dont
bother
can
wise
significantly
more
authentic
on
tap
cynicale
delivered
just
about
what
i
expected
a
refreshing
beer
in
a
can
that
is
nice
to
cool
down
after
a
long
day
in
the
summer
heat
thanks
again
jamie
thanks
to
mikereaser
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
fine
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
reduces
to
a
thin
foam
cap
with
good
lacing
in
the
glass
aroma
is
floral
and
estery
yeast
light
bodied
with
subtle
carbonation
medium
sweetness
and
a
slightly
sour
and
bitter
finish
excellent
drinkability
d
a
very
good
saison
here
probably
my
favorite
surly
beer
to
date
and
that
is
saying
something
nicely
sessionable
despite
the
abv
pours
a
golden
straw
with
a
thin
beige
head
nice
nose
of
herbs
spices
citrus
bready
malts
and
peppery
yeast
taste
is
also
quite
fruity
but
well
balanced
by
the
earthy
yeasts
and
floral
spices
light
body
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
crisp
lingering
finish
one
of
the
best
cans
around
cant
wait
to
try
more
beer
from
surly
this
beer
is
too
damn
drinkable
for
its
abv
if
your
girl
likes
a
light
tasting
beer
and
you
want
her
tipsy
in
a
hurry
then
toss
back
a
couple
of
these
with
her
drinkability
a
nice
drinkable
beer
another
solid
offering
from
surly
d
ive
long
been
a
fan
of
craft
beer
in
a
can
but
they
typically
take
the
form
of
porters
ipas
or
pilsners
a
wordclass
american
saison
is
what
the
craft
beer
movement
in
the
us
is
all
about
maybe
not
the
best
saison
out
there
but
its
very
close
plus
i
absolutely
love
the
name
of
this
beer
d
wish
i
could
order
cases
of
this
stuff
addition
i
have
found
this
beer
to
be
an
excellent
pairing
with
spicy
foods
especially
spicy
curry
or
indian
dishes
drinkability
easy
to
down
this
refreshing
brew
drinkability
is
as
ever
with
every
surly
beer
ive
tried
top
notch
this
isnt
exactly
a
world
shattering
beer
but
its
still
quite
satisfying
after
a
3
hour
walk
and
visit
to
the
botanical
gardens
kudos
once
again
to
surly
once
again
im
glad
im
a
minnesotan
if
only
so
i
could
get
surly
once
again
great
surly
haul
props
to
sonicdescent
im
generally
a
fan
of
the
can
but
this
just
reaffirmed
my
enthusiasm
for
it
i
just
love
the
fact
that
i
poured
a
beautiful
saison
out
of
a
freekin
can
awesome
bright
orange
color
nice
head
initially
but
wish
it
wouldve
lasted
a
little
longer
as
per
the
style
i
drank
it
out
of
a
pint
but
maybe
i
shouldve
gone
with
something
more
shapely
great
nose
on
this
peppery
spice
with
a
nice
pale
malt
sweetness
and
honey
notes
as
suggested
in
the
description
on
the
can
excellent
cripsy
flavor
lightly
malty
and
plenty
of
herbal
floral
notes
and
spicy
hops
fruity
flowery
yeastyness
creamy
honey
flavor
too
these
guys
do
so
many
styles
so
well
all
ive
tried
have
been
great
textbook
examples
of
the
style
while
remaining
individual
and
unique
big
points
for
that
in
my
book
d
pretty
easy
drinking
might
have
to
stock
up
on
this
next
time
i
got
to
mn
great
summer
beer
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
relatively
light
amber
with
tastylooking
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smells
of
coriander
and
citrus
fruits
a
little
funk
comes
through
as
well
a
wonderfully
refreshing
taste
of
spices
is
first
and
foremost
and
nice
tartness
follows
and
is
great
on
the
palette
its
nicely
carbonated
and
has
perfect
thickness
it
hides
any
abv
pretty
well
too
an
absolutely
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
most
so
ive
ever
had
it
was
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
really
think
saison
are
a
great
brew
to
get
me
thinking
of
summer
i
would
drink
this
one
again
if
i
could
find
it
overall
really
good
drinkability
interesting
flavors
that
combine
to
make
a
delicious
beer
the
smell
is
somewhat
subtle
but
really
shines
when
served
in
a
sniftertulip
the
beer
has
a
huge
belgian
ester
character
the
most
prominent
aroma
is
the
citrus
but
there
is
a
bit
of
peppery
phenols
in
there
as
well
the
yeast
character
overwhelms
this
beer
in
a
good
way
the
beer
is
pretty
clear
with
a
golden
colour
too
it
the
white
fluffy
head
is
there
and
stick
around
this
beer
has
loads
of
citrus
esters
with
a
slight
bit
of
phenol
pepper
type
twang
the
esters
linger
on
through
the
beer
which
eventually
met
by
the
bittering
hops
i
dont
get
very
many
hop
notes
in
the
beer
but
the
ester
flavour
is
fanstastic
the
malt
backbone
in
this
beer
is
quite
pleasing
and
gives
just
enough
sweetness
that
makes
the
esters
even
better
with
a
medium
body
and
slightly
high
carbonation
this
is
quite
fucking
drinkable
it
has
a
golden
color
with
a
smallish
head
that
doesnt
stick
aroundpg
lacing
it
smells
like
a
saison
with
its
fruity
aroma
but
it
has
a
quite
strong
hop
aroma
as
well
it
tastes
fruity
and
spicy
and
it
has
some
good
bitterness
it
has
good
mouthfeel
and
nice
carbonation
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
surly
but
they
seem
so
drinkable
maybe
it
is
the
cans
d
both
refreshing
and
a
great
sipper
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
surly
beers
from
a
can
body
seems
a
little
heavier
than
the
saisons
ive
tried
but
its
still
no
fuller
than
medium
crisp
and
refreshing
like
any
good
saison
should
be
the
lively
carbonation
gives
the
tongue
a
nice
tingle
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
really
need
to
establish
permanent
trading
ties
with
a
minnesota
ba
any
volunteers
im
tempted
to
give
cynicale
top
marks
in
every
category
but
on
reflection
there
is
still
some
room
for
improvement
minuscule
but
room
nonetheless
good
beer
in
a
can
im
on
board
thanks
bryan
overall
this
is
a
fairly
hoppy
saison
but
it
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
but
i
think
i
could
enjoy
this
in
any
weather
subtle
flavors
and
light
mouth
feel
make
this
beer
very
drink
able
and
refreshing
d
if
you
can
get
past
the
first
13
glass
its
golden
something
i
might
try
to
give
to
a
bmc
drinker
after
something
a
bit
more
familiar
to
them
d
i
love
it
id
drink
another
and
buy
4
periodically
if
i
lived
within
the
distribution
area
this
is
the
last
of
the
assorted
surly
cans
that
used
to
call
my
beer
fridge
home
time
to
start
thinking
about
trading
for
more
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
with
about
an
inch
to
go
in
the
can
i
stirred
up
the
goodies
and
finished
pouring
appears
a
cloudy
muted
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tight
creamy
light
ecru
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
fruity
slightly
spicy
belgian
yeast
grass
bread
sweet
malts
a
notch
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a

quenching

a
nice
refreshing
saison
a
little
more
tartness
and
a
bit
less
bitterness
and
it
would
be
a
contender
for
my
fav
16
oz
can
poured
into
a
new
belgium
goblet
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
light
head
that
settled
down
into
a
thin
blanket
of
foam
that
persisted
throughout
the
drink
restrained
belgian
fruitiness
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
with
a
hint
of
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
but
appropriate
to
the
beer
a
firm
balanced
bitterness
in
the
finish
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
and
a
perfect
refresher
for
a
warm
afternoon
can
thanks
to
dbhog
thanks
man
poured
into
a
normal
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
murky
yellow
color
there
was
a
very
thin
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
smells
of
pine
fruits
and
hops
i
found
the
beer
to
have
a
nice
spicy
taste
and
a
bitter
finish
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
i
would
love
to
seek
it
out
again
not
a
bad
seasonal
beer
overall
it
tastes
fine
i
just
wouldnt
call
it
a
saison
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
in
a
trade
easy
to
drink
nice
on
a
warm
summer
day
wish
they
sold
these
at
giants
games
to
bad
i
live
in
pa
and
not
mn
and
i
dont
see
surly
coming
to
my
state
anytime
soon
heres
to
hoping
overall
cynicale
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
of
surly
i
think
i
just
got
a
bad
ontap
dnice
drinkability
smooth
character
and
surprisingly
refreshing
many
thanks
to
mandy
for
this
one
overall
awesome
beer
was
very
surprised
and
could
definitely
throw
a
bunch
of
these
back
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
quite
good
medium
body
mouthfeel
wiht
a
nice
creamy
taste
make
for
one
enjoyable
drinking
beer
i
wanted
to
make
this
a
theme
based
review
but
it
was
more
of
a
combo
of
random
thoughts
surly
you
must
be
kidding
dont
call
me
surly
good
thing
surly
looks
out
for
one
guy
surly
another
great
extra
from
dbhog
served
in
my
new
belgium
goblet
poured
a
translucent
burnt
orange
with
a
two
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
sheets
of
stickly
lacing
are
revealed
as
the
brew
receded
nose
suggests
belgian
yeast
some
candi
sugar
and
an
herbalgrassy
quality
missing
the
funk
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
taste
follows
nose
with
a
slightly
herbal
residual
aftertaste
that
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
was
very
lively
and
fairly
lightbodied
this
is
a
very
nice
farmhouse
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
but
somewhat
lacking
in
the
characteristics
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
usually
i
dont
care
much
for
saisons
but
this
one
really
clicked
with
me
i
could
easily
put
back
a
couple
cans
of
this
fantastic
a
great
and
very
enjoyable
saison
complex
unique
totally
unexpected
high
marks
for
fitting
the
saison
style
well
but
not
a
personal
favorite
style
a
complex
beer
that
might
scare
away
the
uninitiated
amazingly
drinkable
light
but
not
vapid
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
definitely
a
fan
of
this
one
and
would
probably
drink
can
after
can
if
i
had
the
option
the
ashaged
is
still
a
little
more
jaw
dropping
than
the
canned
cynic
this
was
surprisingly
good
surly
is
doing
big
things
16oz
can
thanks
to
vwcraig
great
orange
color
with
a
scant
head
smells
like
bready
spices
nice
the
flavor
is
deliciously
fruity
lemons
and
malts
with
a
little
pepper
thrown
in
overall
a
very
tasty
saison
from
a
can
d
very
high
i
could
have
this
all
night
surly
come
to
new
england
the
body
is
moderate
but
still
easy
drinking
the
carbonation
is
light
but
if
it
was
more
then
might
hid
the
light
malt
character
there
is
overall
there
are
some
glaring
off
notes
specifically
the
malt
the
belgian
yeast
character
and
some
water
notes
but
some
positives
with
the
fruity
presence
and
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
in
a
can
props
for
that
maybe
its
old
im
surprised
surly
would
neglect
to
print
a
canning
date
drinkability
this
is
surlys
most
alcoholic
canned
beer
and
still
sits
at
just
6
7
you
wouldnt
want
to
drink
your
whole
four
pack
in
a
row
but
mostly
because
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
appreciated
one
of
the
many
reasons
i
love
surly
brewing
so
much
is
because
they
have
some
of
the
most
flavorful
beers
and
remain
relatively
low
in
alcohol
i
like
getting
buzzed
as
much
as
the
next
ba
but
ive
come
to
realize
that
if
they
could
make
something
that
could
taste
like
this
or
any
other
surly
offering
and
it
was
only
2abv
id
drink
it
just
as
much
if
not
more
as
far
as
this
brew
goes
i
highly
recommend
it
in
fact
if
you
think
you
may
not
like
belgianstyle
ales
definitely
try
this
i
always
review
objectively
but
i
feared
if
i
give
another
surly
an
a
id
come
off
as
a
fanboy
but
you
know
what
i
just
dont
care
this
is
an
a
beer
and
it
deserves
exactly
that
d
this
is
a
great
saison
overall
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
for
awhile
and
was
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so
will
trade
for
it
again
drinkability
im
noticing
that
the
theme
so
far
with
surly
has
been
simplicity
their
brews
thus
far
have
been
straightforward
balanced
and
pretty
darn
drinkable
this
one
is
no
different
just
a
good
reasonably
light
solid
saison
low
in
alcohol
high
in
enjoyability
light
bodied
and
very
light
on
the
palate
with
good
carbonation
mouth
very
peachy
flavor
but
not
the
lush
drippingwithfructose
type
of
peachy
more
like
underripe
bruised
didntripenonthevine
peachy
accents
of
black
pepper
and
earth
diacetyl
is
just
barely
apparent
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
although
the
carbonation
is
noticeably
coarser
than
a
real
belgian
saison
solid
drinkability
but
overall
this
beer
is
only
decent
mouthfeel
is
crisp
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
solid
medium
body
and
touch
of
creaminess
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
great
overall
flavor
profile
i
could
see
myself
going
through
a
4
pack
of
this
in
no
time
flat
this
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorite
surly
brews
i
have
yet
to
sample
a
fine
example
of
a
saison
a
lot
like
dernière
volonté
by
dieu
du
ciel
sticky
styrian
golding
floralherbal
hops
peppercardamom
apricot
sweet
grainy
malt
and
a
nice
smooth
fullness
in
the
mouth
but
with
a
firm
clean
bitterness
hazy
goldenorange
with
slightly
disappointing
head
formationretention
but
its
still
pretty
good
very
aromatic
very
much
like
dieuduciel
i
might
even
prefer
it
m
d
softer
foamy
it
goes
down
rather
nicely
not
too
bad
and
a
decent
offering
from
surly
i
have
so
far
been
fonder
of
the
hoppier
offerings
but
i
would
do
this
one
again
future
outlook
i
am
upset
that
i
cannot
get
this
stuff
here
in
ohio
damn
good
drinkability
very
good
beer
the
complexity
is
nice
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
the
abv
is
at
a
good
level
where
you
can
have
a
few
and
it
wouldnt
be
too
much
glad
to
try
this
one
and
would
definitely
buy
if
given
the
opportunity
easily
sessionable
light
and
refreshing
would
be
good
on
a
warm
day
a
beer
geek
replacement
for
lawnmower
beer
goes
down
pretty
easily
md
very
easy
drinking
flavorful
beer
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
and
am
glad
that
i
was
given
a
4
pack
to
enjoy
really
nice
brew
then
again
i
havent
found
a
surly
product
i
didnt
like
too
bad
theyre
so
far
from
pa
overall
another
superb
beer
by
surly
i
did
not
expect
this
type
of
beer
from
them
but
damn
is
it
good
luckily
i
have
2
more
cans
to
drink
go
me
this
one
pours
a
medium
cloudy
yellow
with
a
quarterinch
white
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
strongly
of
yeast
with
some
apples
thrown
in
tastes
like
a
mild
belgian
ale
strong
yeast
favor
mixed
with
apples
white
wine
pears
and
other
fruit
a
nice
mix
of
flavor
a
slight
amount
of
pungent
aftertaste
carbonation
slightly
lower
than
it
could
have
been
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
mild
but
sharp
carbonation
make
it
pleasant
to
drink
overall
thanks
to
ohlrangers
and
scoobydank
for
both
generously
hooking
me
up
with
this
great
saison
i
like
it
a
lot
i
would
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
this
goes
very
smoothly
and
is
a
welcome
treat
would
enjoy
having
a
lot
more
of
this
around
inseasonearly
summer
excellent
offering
from
the
crew
in
brooklyn
center
this
one
was
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
poured
a
slightley
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
with
minimal
head
on
it
the
smell
is
sour
and
bitter
the
taste
is
yeastey
and
golden
malt
in
the
begining
apricots
peaches
honney
and
a
strong
spicey
black
peeper
notes
in
the
middle
the
end
is
floralpiney
hops
that
fade
quickley
and
leave
only
a
minimal

pours
a
standard
lager
like

with

some

a
little
hot
cynicale
was
yelloworange
in
color
and
hazy
it
had
a
short
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
doughy
and
fruity
with
peppery
spices
the
taste
was
more
peppery
spices
doughy
malt
lightly
fruity
and
some
hops
with
a
fairly
dry
lingering
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
trying
all
told
its
flawed
amd
simple
but
its
alright
i
remember
being
underwhelmed
when
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
long
room
im
glad
i
gave
this
another
chance
although
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
sweetness
in
the
taste
and
not
just
the
smell
one
of
the
better
american
saisons
in
any
case
d
i
gave
this
a
low
number
because
it
does
have
a
rather
high
alcohol
content
to
be
a
session
beer
throw
back
two
of
these
and
maybe
the
hamms
would
look
better
nah
a
unique
offering
that
fits
broadly
into
a
saisonstyle
ale
theres
a
fair
amount
of
complexities
to
it
floral
fruity
spicy
a
bit
much
on
the
black
pepper
after
awhile
allinall
a
nice
something
different
that
is
saisonish
brew
d
above
average
farmhouse
ale
but
not
quite
thrilling
good
but
maybe
too
typical
especially
in
comparison
to
the
other
surly
beers
i
have
tried
i
would
be
challenged
to
finish
an
entire
pint
can
here
surly
is
the
pete
maravich
of
brewers
you
think
theres
nothing
they
could
possibly
do
to
liven
up
a
certain
beer
style
and
then
bam
they
go
and
dribble
through
the
defenders
legs
i
had
this
oakaged
on
cask
and
i
have
to
say
it
might
be
the
only
beer
ive
ever
had
thatd
better
from
a
can
than
on
cask
the
yeast
and
hop
complexity
is
so
wonderful
that
doesnt
make
any
sense
to
blot
it
out
with
oak
flavors
much
more
spicey
and
peppery
in
the
taste
very
good
mouthfeel
wonderfully
biting
and
carbonated
this
could
use
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
funk
very
easy
drinking
and
very
delightful
d
great
i
love
surlys
everything
they
have
is
just
so
fresh
and
tasty
got
it
in
a
pint
glass
right
now
lots
of
sparkly
bubbles
nice
head
even
halfway
through
the
glass
lots
of
lacy
residue
down
the
side
of
the
glass
my
sniffer
isnt
that
sensative
but
there
is
a
marked
fruitspice
aroma
coming
from
the
glass
the
flavor
is
outstanding
rich
malty
fruity
flavors
abound
nice
long
finish
it
has
a
very
good
mouthfeel
kind
of
squishy
and
fullbodied
at
6
7
a
couple
pints
of
this
would
be
plenty
plenty
good
that
is
overall
next
wow
this
is
a
smooth
one
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
mellowed
lemon
citrus
and
crystal
malt
body
that
soon
transitions
to
a
mix
of
white
pepper
soft
hoppy
bitterness
and
other
grassy
spices
the
yeast
adds
a
few
fruity
papaya
and
banana
notes
mouthfeel
is
creamy
wellcarbonated
and
light
in
body
excellent
aftertaste
and
drinkability
and
a
beer
id
be
happy
to
trade
for
again
first
impressions
are
important
and
surly
has
made
a
good
one
on
me
after
darkness
this
is
my
favorite
surly
this
is
a
seriously
drinkable
brew
from
surly
like
most
of
their
offerings
another
great
beer
in
a
can
from
the
boys
in
minnesota
an
affordable
and
accessible
saison
surly
cynicale
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
and
furious
are
two
surly
brew
i
would
love
to
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
drinkability
an
enjoyable
can
of

thanks
to
ohlrangers
for
tossing

cynicales
back
and
enjoy
poured
a
16oz
can
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
1
inch
head
that
left
just
a
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
biscuits
yeast
and
hints
of
apples
and
tangerines
the
taste
is
biscuity
with
a
bit
of
fruity
phenols
and
just
a
hint
of
must
at
the
tail
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
sharp
carbonation
this
would
be
the
perfect
beer
on
a
hot
day
great
stuff
by
surly
d
for
a
beer
that
i
initially
find
to
be
good
for
some
reason
with
every
can
i
find
myself
struggling
to
finish
the
beer
once
i
get
past
34
of
the
way
through
a
can
although
the
6
7
abv
is
well
hidden
quite
drinkable
a
bit
underwhelming
overall
sadly
definitely
worth
a
try
and
interesting
to
get
a
somewhat
belgian
ale
from
a
can
but
its
not
the
best
example
ive
had
of
the
style
by
far
impressive
saison
and
generally
an
impressive
beer
recommended
mouthfeel
is
a
lighter
medium
body
dry
finish
with
a
blanket
after
taste
very
excellent
overall
not
bad
here
at
all
the
style
is
one
that
i
have
become
a
tad
bit
bored
with
lately
but
this
one
really
came
through
quite
nicely
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
again
any
day
about
as
solid
as
they
come
drinks
alright
for
the
style
spot
on
for
the
style
except
for
the
bloody
dryness
i
expect
more
from
surly
than
this
a
very
nice
concoction
and
definitely
recommended
light
in
body
smooth
crisp
and
perfectly
carbonated
great
drinkability
and
incredibly
well
balanced
i
usually
tire
of
the
flavor
of
saisons
midway
through
but
this
one
was
just
about
perfect
drinkability
saison
in
a
can
who
knew
taste
is
crisp
lemon
and
yeast
come
to
mind
right
off
the
bat
weird
aftertaste
that
is
slight
funky
and
slightly
unpleasant
its
funny
how
surly
has
this
reputation
as
a
bigbeer
brewery
but
its
really
just
their
flavors
that
are
huge
with
only
a
couple
bigass
exceptions
most
of
their
beers
have
reasonable
abvs
and
that
makes
them
insanely
drinkable
including
this
one
all
this
flavor
from
a
can
you
gotta
love
it

to

also

this

used

the
taste
is
nice

smooth
you
get
the
nice

as
well
as

the

was
from
a
tap
with
a
nice
strong
bitterness
to
follow
nicely
balanced
between
the
crisp
malt
as
well
as
wheat
likely
because
this
is
not
nearly
as
fresh
there
are
some
spices
i
wouldnt
call
it
sessionable

i
rather

is
just
you
would

a

would
taste
like
with
the

if
this

id
buy
it
in
a

but
this

i
will
certainly
seek
out
some
more
surly
after
tasting
this
one
thanks
again
very
good

5this
saison
from
surly
is
looking
good
malts
and
hops
flavor
begins
with
corriander
and
spicey
belgian
yeast
flavor
moves
to
a
nice
firm
and
sweet
malt
base
and
then
ends
with
a
bitter
hops
kick
its
not
as
light
or
delicate
as
the
best
saisons
this
was
good
and
i
will
have
it
again
to
see
if
each
batch
brings
something
different
to
the
table
but
it
was
only
above
average
for
the
style
and
almost
like
a
stone
book
report
since
the
brew
was
very
nonaggressive
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
those
who
fancy
themselves
as
saison
purists
will
be
a
little
let
down
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
but
to
my
palate
not
great
i
like
the
flavors
of
toasted
malt
orangelike
citrus
and
the
spices
but
for
my
taste
there
is
way
too
much
hops
and
bitterness
it
really
doesnt
even
come
off
as
a
saison
in
my
mind
just
a
very
spicy
american
pale
ale
or
ipa
i
shouldnt
have
been
surprised
this
is
a
beer
brewed
by
stone
brewery
however
i
am
disappointed
overall
i
enjoy
saisons
and
i
enjoy
stone
but
this
was
disappointing
didnt
taste
too
much
like
a
stone
take
on
the
style
and
the
differences
between
this
and
a
traditional
saison
dont
bring
anything
to
the
table
i
find
it
interesting
in
that
the
dryness
at
the
end
prompts
you
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
where
you
found
that
juicy
fruitiness
making
it
almost
compellingly
drinkable
what
it
lacks
is
something
that
i
find
kind
of
intangible
or
at
least
hard
to
explain
in
many
cases
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
complexity
of
the
yeast
this
is
fairly
straightforward
and
essentially
clean
very
yeast
forward
with
some
slight
cyrus
but
heavy
on
the
spice
very
creamy
with
lots
of
carbonation
big
big
big
head
pours
a
deep
cloudy
gold
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
white
head
the
head
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
little
soapy
specks
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
with
big
fruity
esters
and
spices
the
taste
though
is
kind
of
off
and
hard
to
describe
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
match
the
aroma
or
the
style
completely
im
guessing
its
the
different
herbs
used
in
the
brewing
process
its
lightbodied
and
pretty
effervescent
the
flavors
may
work
for
you
they
dont
do
it
for
me
stones
own
attempt
at
a
saison
does
no
harm
a
fair
changeup
from
their
hoppedup
lineup
o
your
opinion
of
this
beers
depends
on
how
you
like
spices
in
beers
to
me
they
really
could
have
called
this
a
spice
beer
rather
than
a
regular
saison
after
a
bit
i
got
used
to
the
thyme
flavor
but
it
still
overwhelms
and
detracts
from
what
you
usually
look
for
in
the
style
tone
down
the
spices
and
dont
filter
it
and
stone
might
have
something
leave
it
to
stone
to
take
a
complex
complicated
style
and
put
its
own
stamp
on
it
however
this
time
its
a
subtle
yet
firm
touch
rather
than
the
usual
slowswinging
sledgehammer
a
pleasant
enjoyable
warm
fall
day
sipper
d
not
really
a
big
fan
with
this
one
at
all
i
find
stones
saison
to
be
just
too
aggressive
for
the
style
has
a
sharp
bitterness
with
some
harsh
smoky
phenol
components
that
really
stand
out
i
typically
look
for
a
more
delicate
and
balanced
approach
here
overall
something
different
but
enjoyable
if
im
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
beer
during
the
summer
its
great
golden
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
white
foam
covers
the
vast
majority
of
the
top
of
this
beer
faint
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
comprised
of
light
bready
malt
and
a
whiff
of
lemon
zest
the
flavor
features
the
belgian
saison
yeast
and
a
nice
lemon
zest
fade
the
mouth
is
slightly
carbonated
and
the
lemon
zest
provides
a
refreshing
angle
aggressive
spice
nose
and
flavor
complex
an
enjoyable
diversion
from
my
usual
corners
of
the
world
but
not
conducive
to
session
drinking
interestingly
spicy
tastes
special
very
drinkable
every
time
i
review
a
beer
from
stone
that
i
do
not
particularly
enjoy
i
say
the
same
thing
i
really
love
stone
and
they
make
great
beers
this
just
isnt
one
of
them
its
somewhere
between
an
interesting
experiment
and
a
flop
i
really
wouldnt
call
this
a
saison
its
lacking
all
the
subtlety
that
the
style
demands
as
a
lavender
herb
beer
i
guess
it
works
oto
much
sprice
and
citrus
rind
taste
ill
avoid
this
one
when
wanting
a
saison

easy
consumption
an

saision
if
thats
what
you
are
looking
for
hardcore
farmhouse
fans
may
find
this
a
bit
of
a
let
down
flavor
wise
im
sure
it
is
a
great
beer
and
that
i
more
than
likely
had
a
bad
bottle
but
the
one
i
had
was
definitely
just
barely
a
1
5
overall
solid
saison
but
not
my
favorite
stone
brew
its
slightly
more
aggressive
than
i
typically
prefer
in
this
style
worth
a
try
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
worthy
of
a
shot
unique
that
you
are
thrown
into
oddity
is
not
nice
to
see
stone
offering
up
something
thats
ostensibly
not
a
hopbomb
of
sorts
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
amberbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
clove
light
black
pepper
sweet
flowers
light
grass
light
wheat
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
belgian
candi
sugar
the
taste
continues
to
bring
the
spice
pain
the
lemon
wheat
and
yeast
tossed
on
the
back
burner
to
languish
some
leafy
greens
try
to
peak
in
from
the
distant
background
but
to
very
little
avail
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
though
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
per
se
its
a
pretty
weak
excuse
for
a
saison
yeah
im
probably
not
gonna
grab
another
bottle
of
this
any
time
soon
tons
of
spice
and
floral
notes
overwhelming
almoststillan
interesting
beer
overall
wow
this
thing
is
a
spice
bomb
it
seems
like
there
might
be
a
decent
saison
in
there
but
it
is
so
aggressively
spiced
that
its
hard
to
tell
it
also
takes
what
should
be
a
refreshing
style
and
makes
the
drinkability
very
low
if
youre
a
big
fan
spiced
beers
then
this
may
be
your
thing
but
otherwise
id
stay
away
a
superlative
example
of
the
style
and
probably
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
really
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
dull
orangegold
with
a
murky
clarity
and
a
frothy
1
5
inch
bright
white
head
nose
suggests
coriander
citrus
zest
and
an
herbal
presence
taste
is
much
more
herbal
than
suggested
by
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
lavender
and
thyme
and
finishes
with
a
slight
peppery
kick
and
a
lingering
medicinal
bitterness
which
i
cant
say
that
im
overly
fond
of
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
light
in
body
with
a
bright
carbonation
and
a
mild
citric
acidity
all
and
all
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
there
is
too
much
happening
in
the
herbs
department
which
makes
it
far
from
refreshing
light
bodied
modest
carbonation
has
a
strong
lavender
aftertaste
not
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
and
i
say
that
as
one
who
likes
most
stone
beers
does
not
taste
like
a
saison
its
too
assertively
spiced
and
has
a
strong
medicinal
flavor
its
almost
completely
undrinkable
and
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
after
drinking
half
the
pint
hoping
it
would
grow
on
me
this
beer
is
a
terrible
offering
from
stone
very
disappointing
save
your
money
not
a
saison
not
remotely
close
to
a
saison
not
even
a
good
beer
not
the
best
saison
in
my
humble
opinion
but
if
youve
had
it
and
enjoyed
it
then
thats
all
that
really
matters
it
didnt
blow
me
away
very
average
tasting
saison
not
a
ton
of
spice
and
the
aftertaste
could
be
a
bit
more
pleasant
misc
went
well
with
tuna
and
wasabi
dont
let
this
beer
warm
up
too
much
as
it
becomes
overpoweringly
sour
this
is
my
first
saison
so
i
am
not
rating
by
style
a
well
done
saison
the
herbs
notes
are
enjoyable
but
prevent
me
from
wanting
another
glass
if
this
is
an
expired
beer
then
i
can
only
imagine
that
a
fresher
version
would
be
even
better
i
can
see
that
this
beer
would
not
be
for
everyone
but
for
an
unusual
spicy
refreshing
summer
brew
it
does
the
trick
quite
nicely

12oz

with
a
giant
pillowy
white
head
pervasive
and
pleasant
aroma
of
lemon
verbena
and
lavender
flavor
brings
some
immediate
acidity
sourness
is
accentuated
by
a
heftly
load
of
carbon

past
that
theres
a
little
bit
of
fruit
on
the
tongue
and
a
pleasant
almostdry
finish
but
really
the
sourness
just
isnt
my
thing
this
is
clearly
a
well
executed
belgian
saison
but
im
not
feeling
it
o
i
was
really
hoping
this
beer
would
taste
like
tiger
cub
saison
because
that
was
actually
a
good
saison
this
one
just
has
way
too
many
spices
and
is
onedimensional
as
a
result
drinkable
just
not
any
fun
to
drink
overall
i
absolutely
love
saisons
and
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
style
stone
has
not
done
it
justice
making
a
good
saison
basically
involves
using
the
right
yeast
and
the
right
temperatures
it
seems
like
stone
just
through
a
ton
of
spices
in
the
brew
to
cover
up
any
imperfections
not
really
worth
seeking
out
with
a
towering
white
head
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
cloudy
hazy
and
goldenyellow
the
appearance
is
great
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
notable
hop
spice
and
a
little
soft
malt
smells
the
taste
is
peppery
dry
and
more
bitter
than
expected
malt
flavors
are
present
but
fruit
is
distant
and
the
most
notable
characteristic
is
spiciness
and
hop
bitterness
medium
in
body
the
dryness
makes
the
beer
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
overall
good
solid
saison
safe
might
be
the
most
apt
word
to
describe
it
im
not
usually
one
to
suggest
a
beer
food
pairing
but
i
think
this
would
go
awesome
with
a
salmon
and
wild
rice
dinner
d
the
appearance
and
aromas
are
appealing
enough
but
things
begin
to
fall
apart
a
bit
in
terms
of
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
overall
a
bit
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
end
result
is
one
of
the
few
overall
misses
that
ive
encountered
from
stone
the
recent
stone
matts
buring
rosids
smoked
saison
is
far
far
superior
offering
there
are
too
many
excellent
saisons
out
there
to
recommend
this
one
with
good
conscious
sorry
stone
pours
a
fairly
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
smallish
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
filled
with
an
overwhelming
amont
of
spice
that
is
barely
backed
up
by
some
bready
lemony
malt
the
flavor
again
is
over
the
top
spices
with
hints
of
bready
lemon
hints
of
earth
and
funk
medium
body
mderate
carbonation
too
spicy
for
me
i
can
see
past
the
spice
rack
update
doh
i
finally
read
the
bottle
this
brew
is
made
with
lemon
thyme
and
lavender
plus
lemon
zest
that
makes
so
much
sense
i
picked
out
the
lemon
thyme
quite
proud
of
that
actually
but
missed
the
lavender
its
there
if
you
go
looking
for
it
but
is
easily
hidden
and
confounded
by
the
thyme
and
lemony
notes
nicely
blended
profile
but
i
still
get
marjoram
and
sage
its
an
interesting
bouquet
to
say
the
least
first
off

finger

left
quickly
though
slight

was
present
throughout
beautiful
copper

interesting

of

as
things
warmed
up
and
belgian

in
a
good
way
again
new
to
saisons
tasted
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
nice
peppery
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
stepping
stones
like
this
could
get
me
more
interested
in
the
belgian
styles
as
a
whole
well
worth
a
try
an
okay
saison
onedimensional
in
a
weird
way
with
a
hefty
dose
of
added
citrus
thats
just
too
much
overpowering
the
subtler
saison
character
overall
a
pretty
middleoftheroad
saison
which
is
more
or
less
what
i
was
expecting
enjoyable
enough
but
not
in
the
same
class
as
some
of
the
greats
pours
yellow
and
hazy
with
a
thin
head
nof
white
foam
that
falls
fast
but
leaves
a
film
on
top
and
some
loose
bubbles
has
a
good
bit
of
funk
on
the
nose
and
some
honey
malt
sweetness
a
nice
tart
lemon
with
some
bright
lemon
peel
a
bit
of
floral
musk
and
a
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
could
use
just
a
few
more
bubbles
drinks
well
though
with
a
soft
malt
cracker
sweetened
with
honey
a
bit
of
that
funk
gets
to
the
palate
and
is
a
touch
sour
the
fruits
combine
in
this
for
an
overall
fruity
middle
but
nothing
you
could
name
finishes
dry
and
a
touch
tart
with
some
aftertaste
to
leave
you
thinking
that
maybe
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
it
has
a
musky
floral
that
develops
in
the
nose
as
it
warms
and
that
is
light
and
powdery
dry
in
the
drink
also
shows
some
pepprcorns
as
i
am
finishing
the
glass
i
could
certainly
do
without
the
added
spices
but
overall
an
adequate
americanmade
saison
i
hope
stone
revamps
the
shit
out
of
this
beer
because
it
sure
needs
it
o
fruity
and
light
a
soft
saison
tasty
beer
semidry
from
start
to
finish
the
body
feels
light
while
maintaining
closer
to
medium
but
bright
zesty
crisp
and
refreshing
enough
that
its
far
from
heavy
dryness
and
spiciness
work
on
the
palate
gently
but
convincingly
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
thin
head
nose
is
moderately
assertive
with
some
nice
barnyard
and
funky
fruits
maybe
smelly
cheese
palate
offers
a
nice
sourness
good
drinkability
citrusy
hops
and
good
carbonation
easier
drinking
than
many
other
american
attempts
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
bbq
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
ribs
rotisserie
chicken
or
kabobs
i
could
also
see
going
into
seafood
with
a
great
beer
like
this
one
toss
back
one
or
two
while
chowing
down
on
some
crab
lobster
or
even
a
nice
piece
of
pan
seared
halibut
rjt
overall
not
a
terrible
brew
but
i
think
it
falls
short
in
terms
of
the
style
the
metallic
taste
was
hard
to
overlook
seems
muddled
in
terms
of
the
flavors
nothing
really
crisp
or
welldefined
pours
a
light
golden
color
mostly
clear
with
a
chill
haze
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
aroma
has
herbal
notes
clove
rosemary
sage
in
the
taste
pepper
clove
rosemary
and
sage
light
bitterness
but
definitely
big
herbal
and
spice
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
good
carbonation
overall
decent
but
definitely
herbal
and
spicy
and
the
more
it
lingers
and
burns
in
my
mouth
the
more
idiotic
this
beer
comes
off
more
bread
in
the
initial
taste
with
a
kick
of

folks
that
want
an
easy

introduction
to
the
style
flavors
and

are
true
to
the
style
and
this
one
is
pretty
refreshing
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
alcohol
is
well
hidden
ive
always
enjoyed
a
good
saison
so
i
was
happy
to
see
stone

to
drink
not
stare
at
the
aroma
is
such
that
there
is
no
mistaking
it
as
anything
other
than
a
saison
there
is
a
hint
of
orange
beyond
the
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
citrusy
yeast
flavor
followed
by

more
peppery
than
the
runofthemill
saison
which
i
enjoy
a
faint
piney

bitterness

on

overall
a

my

overall
i
quite
like
this
beer
i
am
not
uber
familiar
with
saisons
but
this
one
impressed
me
quite
a
bit
i
would
drink
it
again
and
hope
to
try
more
overall
kind
of
odd
with
the
sweet
lemon
soapy
spices
and
a
bitter
peppery
finish
eric
o
a
fairly
simple
and
easygoing
saison
definitely
leans
more
on
the
lemon
and
pepper
notes
than
anything
else
if
you
enjoy
stone
its
worth
a
shot
itll
probably
get
lost
in
the
sea
of
different
saisons
otherwise
overall
verdict
a
decent
saison
like
most
of
stones
beers
this
one
isnt
subtle
its
a
good
inyourface
saison
but
is
a
bit
one
dimensionally
heavy
on
the
pepper
spice
otoo
one
dimensional
heavily
spiced
with
little
nuance
but
still
a
decent
saison
overall
oh
yeah
sign
me
up
for
this
when
it
finally
gets
to
illinois
a
very
american
saison
and
everything
you
would
expect
from
stone
stone
haters
be
damned
this
and
go
to
will
be
my
summer
beers
all
year
stone
have
never
been
much
for
treading
lightly
and
this
is
hardly
an
exception
once
again
theyve
managed
to
take
a
style
i
almost
invariably
enjoy
and
leave
me
nonplussed
and
underwhelmed
ill
give
them
points
for
creativity
though
as
ive
never
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
id
consider
this
as
something
of
a
concept
beer
as
opposed
to
a
proper
saison
its
certainly
an
adventure
for
the
taste
buds
if
nothing
else
pours
out
a
pale
brass
with
a
moderate
head
thyme
and
citrus
is
very
evident
in
the
smell
along
with
some
earthy
hops
flavor
is
of
crackery
maltsgrains
floral
hops
thyme
citrus
and
lavender
finishes
relatively
dry
body
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
american
version
of
a
saison
lovely
gold
colored
body
with
exceptional
clarity
the
head
formation
was
about
one
finger
thick
forming
sheets
of
lace
the
aroma
was
very
floral
and
herbal
with
a
smell
of
lavender
dried
coriander
seeds
and
thyme
the
taste
was
a
little
unusual
for
the
style
as
the
notes
of
spice
and
flowers
that
were
first
evident
in
the
nose
were
followed
shortly
by
an
unexpected
hop
bitterness
and
then
finished
with
a
dash
of
pepper
the
feel
was
little
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
style
making
this
more
of
a
summertime
saison
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
usual
stone
offerings
this
beer
is
more
of
an
experiment
than
another
addition
to
the
line
up
for
me
overall
look
dont
kid
yourself
im
actually
a
fan
of
lavender
but
wow
the
wheels
fell
off
fast
what
a
complete
shock
of
a
surprise
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
and
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
hazy
golden
yellow
covered
with
a
nice
looking
head
of
sticky
creaminess
smells
like
a
pleasant
blend
of
herbs
and
flowers
on
top
of
a
biscuity
pale
malt
base
lavender
cardamom
coriander
honey
flower
petals
licorice
and
sugary
citrus
spiced
up
and
adorned
like
many
american
saisons
tend
to
be
but
stone
pulls
of
the
blend
very
well
flavor
opens
up
with
a
blast
of
spicy
yeast
leading
to
a
more
subtle
lavender
and
herb
presence
and
finishing
quite
crisp
and
dry
zesty
citrus
perfumey
floral
notes
peppercorns
grass
and
mint
definitely
not
a
saison
where
the
yeast
and
funk
do
all
the
talking
again
more
of
a
jazzedup
american
style
which
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
but
i
like
the
end
result
here
its
a
fun
pleasant
tasty
blend
of
flavors
that
i
found
quite
enjoyable
taste
carries
on
the
concept
with
a
light
body
and
perhaps
sensing
some
wheat
in
the
mix
smooth
aftter
a
spin
yet
perhaps
a
bit
thin
without
carbonation
is
there
but
not
quite
as
firm
as
i
would
prefer
interesting
finish
and
a
bit
cloaking
not
very
yeastspice
driven
but
yet
not
so
in
a
negativeadditive
sense
either
starts
off
as
a
bpa
but
finishes
differently
but
yet
not
to
style
as
a
saison
good
but
a
bit
chalky
in
the
end
for
the
style
this
could
be
great
yet
the
sum
of
its
parts
is
anything
but
close
and
probably
easily
fixable
but
as
it
is
i
can
promise
you
that
this
particular
stone
fan
will
never
revisit
it
overall
drinkability
overall
an
extreme
beer
id
almost
call
it
gruit
herbed
beer
with
all
the
strong
herbal
flavors
going
on
with
this
beer
so
an
overall
interesting
beer
but
i
would
not
have
recognized
it
for
a
saison
if
it
hadnt
said
so
on
the
glass
too
strong
herbal
flavors
and
not
enough
malt
and
other
flavors
to
compliment
but
maybe
thats
the
point
stone
wanted
to
make
in
complimenting
the
herbs
from
their
garden
as
for
drinkability
one
is
enough
i
could
not
have
a
second
one
as
it
awfully
powerful
on
the
palate
and
wears
it
out
its
the
lavender
i
think
ive
had
it
once
or
twice
in
beers
and
it
always
wrecks
my
taste
buds
so
great
looking
beer
and
it
smells
really
nice
but
then
it

better
another
classic
over
the

by

is
the

superb
very
good
beer
and
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
be
filtered
is
a
big
plus
for
me
as
i
have
to
limit
yeast
consumption
for
health
reasons
which
has
really
taken
a

on

consumption
of

but
drinkable
as
a
long

fan
of
stone
i
was
excited
to
try
their
take
on
the
saison
picked
up
a
sixer
for
a
memorial
day
bbq
this
one
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
small
and
short
lasting
white
head
that
leaves
little

the
nose
is
a
refreshing
blend
of
citrus
lemon
peel
and
oranges
spices
coriander
pepper
and
juniper
and
bready
malt
and
funky
yeast
its
quite
a
nice
bouquet
the
mouthfeel
is
light
effervescent
and
quenching
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
the
nose
with
more
west
coast
hops
dominating
and
not
as
much
of
the
belgian
and
farmhouse
characteristics
coming
through
it
is
still
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
spice
and
funkiness
though
this
was
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
such
a
great
brewer
uts
definitely
a
stone

really

parameters
as
a
hoppy
belgian
ale
not

bad
o
an
awesome
seasonal
saison
pairs
great
with
spicy
food
abv
is
under
control
surprisingly
from
stone
well
done
overall
a
simple
solid
fun
offering
from
the
stone
gang
o
i
love
stone
and
think
this
is
a
well
done
beer
its
just
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
certainly
worthy
of
a
try
though
o
not
the
best
saison
but
still
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
not
a
bad
attempt
of
a
saison
though
nowhere
near
close
to
some
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
vigorously
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
half
an
inch
of
foamy
white
head
sitting
on
a
slightly
hazy
amber
beer
head
dissipated
quickly
into
small
islands
lots
of
malt
and
spices
on
the
nose
some
hop
but
mostly
spice
tastes
like
it
smells
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
brews
to
be
had
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
they
werent
as
refined
as
i
would
like
them
to
be
and
that
made
this
beer
feel
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
and
the
balance
seemed
to
be
a
little
out
of
wack
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
not
the
cleanest
slightly
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
so
one
would
be
enough
for
me
i
dont
have
any
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
it
seemed
to
be
the
aspect
that
was
truest
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
and
the
lower
amount
of
carbonation
to
me
those
were
things
that
needed
the
most
work
i
wouldnt
get
this
beer
again
its
pretty
easy
to
find
a
saison
that
better
suites
my
taste
and
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
good
saison
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
lately
ive
found
myself
being
a
little
let
down
with
these
new
beers
from
stone
and
this
one
is
no
different
its
for
sure
not
my
favorite
saison
and
its
not
even
close
to
being
one
of
the
better
beers
from
stone
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
this
one
could
use
some
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
m
light
and
refreshing
sans
the
lingering
character
mentioned
earlier
o
i
admit
being
completely
skeptical
in
stones
ability
to
make
a
proper
saison
as
a
simple
herbedspiced
beer
honestly
it
aint
bad
but
as
a
saison
fail
fail
fail
this
actually
makes
a
really
good
comparison
to
allagashs
saison
i
just
had
a
few
minutes
ago
allagash
saison
is
subtle
and
balanced
this
isnt
allagash
saison
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
this
isnt
but
hey
this
does
do
one
thing
better
than
allagash
saison
its
far
more
overspiced
about
the
only
things
it
really
does
right
is
a
its
not
undrinkable
and
b
could
make
a
solid
cooking
adjunct
good
beer
quite
an
interesting
saison
i
like
the
peppery
tastes
a
lot
it
aint
a
colette
but
its
a
good
saison
for
sure
a
good
attempt
at
a
saison
but
a
bit
too
spicy
and
bitter
on
the
end
the
light
malt
backbone
is
almost
there
but
still
not
quite
overall
a
tasty
and
pleasant
ale
bit
sweeter
than
the
average
saison
i
dig
it
first
sip
had
me
disappointed
but
it
was
just
too
cold
to
be
sipped
when
i
first
tasted
it
i
wish
i
know
the
exact
price
i
paid
on
this
beer
as
i
got
it
at
a
beer
store
i
dont
usually
go
to
and
there
wasnt
a
sticker
on
the
bottle
or
a
receipt
wtf
it
really
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
and
im
not
finding
it
nearly
as
harsh
as
some
other
reviewers
do
with
the
carbonation
the
lavender
is
definitely
there
but
not
in
an
overlydone
way
and
the
lemon
zest
and
thyme
make
an
otherwisecansometimesbe
boring
style
more
interesting
its
not
blowing
me
away
but
i
like
that
little
bit
of
saison
funk
with
the
added
flavors
as
it
makes
for
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
nice
job
again
stone
i
like
this
it
might
not
be
a
traditional
example
of
the
style
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
an
enjoyable
beer

lemony
and
herbal
with
a
nice
spicy
base
to
me
none
of
the
flavors
are
too
over
the
top
and
i
think
they
balance
out
nicely
but
i
could
see
how
some
get
turned
off
excellent
beer
extends
the
dimension
of
the
style
in
a
dominating
way
which
stone
fans
are
bound
to
appreciate
not
anywhere
near
my
favorite
saison
but
a
great
hot
weather
cooler
and
far
more
affordable
than
the
authentic
belgian
ones
ill
definitely
revisit
this
one
a
time
or
two
this
summer
o
a
nice
saison
for
the
price
worth
picking
up
overall
this
is
a
solid
saison
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
the
verdict
very
good
everything
a
saison
should
be
with
some
added
stone
freshness
and
some
california
style
spice
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
it
has
an
extreme
sweet
lemon
and
bitter
hop
scent
its
a
gold
with
a
very
mild
haze
to
it
limited
white
head
and
little
lacing
overall
ok
but
nothing
great
too
much
hop
component
but
thats
typical
stone
nice
spices
but
a
bit
too
much
decent
farmhouse
but
not
enough
i
think
but
typical
american
saison
that
doesnt
quite
get
the
style
original
style
but
its
a
thing
of
its
own
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
much
as
a
french
or
belgian
overall
a
really
interesting
and
good
twist
on
a
saison
solid
fruit
notes
with
a
bigger
hop
presence
than
typical
for
the
style
the
lavender
adds
a
really
interesting
and
nice
kick
i
havent
had
such
a
lavender
heavy
beer
since
indeeds
lsd
overall
i
like
this
quite
a
lot
and
would
get
it
again
though
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
spunky
and
refreshing
profile
wins
me
over
in
the
end
i
think
its
a
unique
take
on
a
saison
and
fits
in
well
within
the
usual
clean
profile
of
stones
lineup
its
going
in
too
many
different
places
at
once
with
the
flavor
profile
strange
to
have
a
sasion
coming
from
stone
it
was
quite
good
fruity
and
somewhat
skunky
or
sour
like
a
saison
should
be
that
being
said
this
still
might
be
my
least
favorite
stone
beer
there
are
plenty
of
other
amazing
saisons
out
there
so
why
take
a
departure
from
what
you
do
best
o
appearance
and
aroma
were
wonderful
taste
was
too
hoppy
mouth
feel
was
ok
if
they
had
cut
the
hops
in
half
this
would
have
been
much
better
let
the
yeast
shine
this
is
pretty
tasty
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
super
dry
nicie
spicy
with
all
that
lemon
and
pepper
with
a
stronger
bitterness
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
buy
this
again
very
recommended
o
drinkable
for
sure
interesting
yes
great
maybe
not
seems
a
bit
dull
and
lifeless
for
the
style
a
style
that
is
so
broad
and
filled
with
countless
stretches
on
the
borders
of
the
style
in
many
examples
seems
a
bit
bland
and
lifeless
by
comparison
and
probably
overhopped
and
too
bitter
the
hops
seem
to
push
back
all
of
the
other
character
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
m
less
of
a
crushable
refreshing
saison
and
more
of
a
complex
sipper
akin
to
a
belgian
ipa
but
with
a
very
dry
finish
not
sweet
one
bit
ample
delicious
hops
let
you
know
this
is
still
a
stone
brew
this
saison
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
color
threw
me
off
a
bit
i
expected
it
to
be
cloudy
its
clear
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
earthy
spiciness
so
that
was
good
the
taste
comes
on
spicy
like
i
would
expect
in
a
saison
but
this
one
finishes
with
a
pretty
big
bitter
kick
which
i
realized
this
is
a
beer
from
stone
they
typically
throw
a
punch
this
is
what
you
should
expect
from
a
saison
from
stone
nup
its
okay
but
only
okay
stone
are
good
craftsmenthey
have
the
skill
to
get
the
fundamentals
rightbut
theres
absolutely
no
art
to
the
beer
and
this
is
a
style
that
demands
it
its
a
weak
disappointing
echo
of
a
great
style
and
there
are
far
better
examples
out
there
for
you
to
find
o
an
interesting
twist
on
a
farmhouse
ale
not
sure
i
would
put
in
the
saison
category
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
farmhouse
style
ale
o
awesome
very
peppery
saison
need
to
find
in
the
stores
i
feel
like
this
could
be
one
of
the
first
cheap
saisons
yummy
grab
a
bottle
overall
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
saison
with
a
complex
mix
of
flavors
that
mostly
works
definitely
offstyle
but
i
dont
care
about
strict
guidelines
this
does
not
seem
quite
true
to
style
but
i
found
it
tasty
nonetheless
overall
an
alright
saison
but
overly
spiced
and
rather
unbalanced
with
too
much
herb
and
grass
to
really
make
it
all
that
enjoyable
so
stones
take
on
a
saison
is
really
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
its
a
pretty
decent
one
more
enjoyable
than
calibelgique
ipa
as
far
as
im
concerned
overall
the
taste
is
ok
but
the
sourness
is
too
high
especially
in
the
finish
really
overpowers
the
overall
flavor
would
like
to
see
some
more
fruits
take
stage
over
all
the
lemon
and
sour
flavors
its
decent
not
great
and
nothing
id
seek
out
or
really
need
to
have
again
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
im
overly
sensitive
to
bitterness
so
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
now
all
that
being
said
would
i
buy
it
again
hard
to
say
if
i
just
wanted
a
beer
and
didnt
want
to
think
about
it
i
might
grab
this
if
i
wanted
a
saison
id
still
go
with
dupont
or
logsdon
cheers
certainly
more
hoppy
than
most
farmhouse
ales
its
easy
to
forget
that
saisons
can
be
quite
hoppy
stones
use
of
citrusy
american
hops
may
kick
it
out
of
belgian
style
but
reigns
in
into
west
coast
style
o
i
expected
more
with
this
one
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
othe
first
sniff
and
sip
i
was
very
unimpressed
it
grew
on
me
slowly
and
invade
six
of
these
things
so
i
will
finish
them
all
but
its
not
going
to
be
the
best
experience
cracked
open
a
fresh
bottle
it
poured
a
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
overall
its
a
dry
and
spicy
saison
but
with
hits
of
citrus
you
wont
find
in
traditional
belgians
the
aroma
is
more
grassy
lemon
while
the
flavor
matches
juicy
hops
with
coriander
and
peppercorns
there
is
an
astringent
touch
in
the
mouthfeel
that
knocks
the
beer
but
otherwise
this
is
a
very
solid
american
take
on
the
style
definitely
give
it
a
shot
light
body
with
a
crisp
peppery
spice
presence
thats
countered
by
bready
yeast
farmhouse
funk
light
fruit
notes
and
tart
citrus
sweetness
the
zesty
spice
is
prominent
with
hints
of
white
pepper
ginger
grains
of
paradise
and
coriander
this
is
complimented
by
a
subtle
earthygrassy
hop
presence
and
a
decent
amount
of
musty
saison
yeast
decent
amount
of
funk
without
overpowering
the
other
notes
giving
off
hints
of
wet
hay
straw
and
grass
some
bread
and
biscuit
flavor
present
midpalate
followed
by
apple
pear
and
citrus
sweetness
again
the
citrus
flavor
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
with
slightly
tart
lemon
juice
and
zesty
lemon
rind
overall
the
flavor
profile
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
nothing
really
stands
out
but
there
is
an
excellent
balance
of
interesting
flavor
not
in
the
top
tier
of
saisons
ive
tried
but
its
light
flavorful
and
dangerously
sessionable
a
decent
go
to
beer
for
warmer
weather
months
o
im
very
impressed
with
how
well
they
made
this
i
think
i
would
be
more
apt
to
buy
this
if
it
was
9
99
and
not
12
99
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
will
pair
well
with
seafood
and
lemon

it

the

with

has

with

this
is
a
pretty
good

with

o
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
from
them
for
a
saison
i
feel
like
saisons
are
quite
varied
and
have
a
whole
spectrum
unto
themselves
perhaps
a
less
bold
version
of
the
saison
du
buff
collaboration
from
a
while
back
stones
belgian
style
ales
are
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
added
herbs
are
unique
bright
and
spicy
but
ultimately
wont
set
this
one
apart
from
any
other
saison
sessionable
available
and
a
safe
addition
to
the
stone
lineup
in
time
for
summer
dry
and
crisp
to
a
fault
o
a
hoppy
saison
very
refreshing
with
the
right
amount
of
complexity
a
great
beer
for
the
warm
transition
between
spring
and
summer
overall
decent
attempt
by
stone
its
nowhere
near
the
best
saison
ive
had
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
saison
but
its
decent
and
i
can
say
i
tried
it
not
something
i
will
probably
ever
buy
again
but
decent
overall

what
the
eff
stone
sometimes
all
people
talk
about
is
do
something
other
than
hops
for
once
stone
make
a
nonipa
for
once
stone
well
you
did
with
this
beer
and
guess
what
it
doesnt
suck
in
fact
its
pretty
damn
good
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
complexity
multiple
distinct
components
nothing
clashing
nothing
overwhelming
nothing
muted
personally
i
found
the
appearance
somewhat
lacking
after
the
head
died
down
but
the
aroma
taste
and
feel
were
all
really
really
good
some
selfprofessed
purists
will
claim
that
this
beer
is
too
sweet
it
really
isntthe
sweetness
is
moderate
at
best
but
thats
just
my
opinion
some
nonpurists
will
be
disappointed
that
its
not
funky
tart
or
musty
and
some
newbies
will
drink
it
too
damn
cold
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
more
or
less
a
classically
belgianleaning
nonfunky
saison
that
manages
to
tastefully
incorporate
some
interesting
ingredients
that
never
clash
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
and
very
pleased
that
stones
put
a
slightlymoreaffordable
saison
in
sixers
very
happy
with
this
yuck
way
over
spiced
no
balance
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
what
i
expected
and
another
beer
im
glad
i
tried
but
i
would
not
try
again
unless
it
was
a
food
pairing
designed
to
compliment
this
beer
each
sip
had
sensory
distortion
as
the
aroma
coming
up
through
my
tulip
glass
just
blasted
me
with
herbs
and
kept
the
overall
experience
out
of
synch
gotta
support
the
cause
and
the
craft
beer
movement
but
these
misses
are
like
collateral
damage
in
the
war
to
keep
the
beer
machine
flowing
one
and
done
on
this
collaboration
o
an
interesting
saison
but
it
could
have
been
better
the
flavors
do
not
separate
enough
and
in
terms
of
texture
this
beer
falls
apart
in
the
mouth
for
me
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
drink
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
is
still
a
missed
opportunity
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
it
washes
down
rather
clean
there
is
no
real
bite
from
the
carbonation
dry
finish
the
sweetness
and
hint
of
spices
blend
well
together
to

a
refreshing

good
beer
im
not
sure
about
how
it
measures
up
to
other
saisons
but
i
like
to
see
breweries
collaborating
on
beer
overall
a
unique
saison
that
uses
various
herbs
this
is
not
for
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
the
variety
of
flavours
o
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wanted
to
say
that
up
front
i
hold
all
three
breweries
dogfish
head
stone
and
victory
in
high
regards
so
i
guess
my
expectations
were
set
higher
than
what
i
experienced
three
style
pushing
breweries
creating
an
american
saison
sounds
good
the
aroma
is
a
herb
bomb
with
big
rosemary
and
thyme
notes
the
taste
brings
a
nice
saison
spice
along
with
big
herbal
flavor
at
the
end
there
is
a
warming
from
the
alcohol
and
some
dark
fruit
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
everyday
but
a
great
example
of
what
all
three
of
these
breweries
are
all
about
great
collab
looks
good
with
a
bright
golden
color
big
fluffy
head
and
good
lacing
smell
of
hoppy
citrus
and
lots
of
herbs
also
a
little
herb
spice
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
too
which
was
nice
and
a
dry
finish
very
smooth
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
a
pleasant
and
moderately
complex
saison
refreshing
when
imbibed
fresh
out
of
the
refrigerator
but
permit
it
to
drift
toward
room
temperature
to
appreciate
its
more
subtly
nuanced
elements
last
years
vintage
and
still
drinking
mighty
fine
bright
gold
hue
good
clarity
thin
white
foamy
head
musty
attic
on
the
nose
with
spice
and
a
belgian
funk
hints
of
rosemary
and
banana
strong
yeast
presence
drinks
almost
as
it
did
fresh
spice
presence
is
still
noticeable
and
so
is
the
balancing
hop
profile
spicy
through
out
with
a
sweet
belgian
flair
and
herbal
hops
to
round
things
out
pretty
nice
touch
more
alcohol
heat
then
i
remember
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
for
sure
however
the
overall
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
was
not
pleasing
again
i
hate
giving
this
low
of
a
score
for
these
three
breweries
but
this
beer
left
me
dissapponted
live
life
drink
beer
the
beer
should
have
a
disclaimer
to
require
it
to
pair
with
savory
meats
like
roast
beef
pork
belly
or
tequila
lime
tacos
as
a
stand
alone
beer
the
exotic
herbs
seem
to
be
veering
off
in
left
field
and
lacking
purpose
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
in
which
non
traditional
ingredients
are
well
played
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
and
i
look
forward
to
my
other
single
o
a
fun
spicy
herbaly
grassy
grainy
fruity
beer
a
decent
little
collaboration
from
three
great
breweries
o
as
expected
an
interesting
if
not
wholly
successful
collaborative
experiment
bold
flavor
combinations
but
the
contrast
between
the
lemonspice
flavors
and
the
harsh
finish
is
too
much
still
worth
trying
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
nice
and
refreshing
would
be
perfect
on
a
summer
day
o
on
the
high
side
abv
wise
for
a
saison
maybe
a
bit
to
much
hoppy
bitterness
but
refreshing
nothing
particularly
amazing
to
look
at
but
i
really
loved
the
funky
herbal
aroma
that
came
off
this
thing
because
of
the
herbs
i
paired
it
with
a
pesto
chicken
pizza
with
red
peppers
and
goat
cheese
while
this
pairing
looked
good
on
paper
im
not
sure
it
was
really
the
best
idea
it
turns
out
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
so
interesting
that
i
almost
forgot
that
i
was
eating
pizza
i
noticed
the
rosemary
first
and
then
a
sort
of
sweet
citrusy
flavor
which
gave
way
to
an
herbalhoppy
bitterness
while
the
flavor
was
unique
and
memorable
it
wasnt
so
overpowering
as
many
of
these
experimental
brews
can
be
that
i
wouldnt
be
happy
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
o
very
interesting
and
very
different
from
a
standard
lager
but
refreshing
and
not
challenging
once
you
get
past
that
funky
aroma
overall
a
very
good
beer
seek
it
out
unless
you
dont
like
herbs
pale
hazy
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
in
my
sam
adams
glass
respectable
amount
of
lacing
some
specks
floating
around
and
light
carbonation
visible
smell
is
very
good
with
a
firm
pale
malt
body
and
a
caramel
honey
sweetness
some
of
the
usual
belgian
funk
and
yeast
esters
the
signature
spices
are
not
shy
here
with
the
rosemary
being
the
biggest
player
taste
has
more
of
the
spices
up
front
with
a
grassiness
from
the
parsley
and
sage
flowing
in
the
malt
strong
almost
grapefruit
like
bitterness
seems
to
be
from
an
equal
amount
of
hops
and
spice
blend
that
covers
the
aforementioned
citrus
finish
is
spicy
and
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
mint
light
tingley
feel
is
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
an
interesting
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
all
the
time
but
once
in
a
while
i
would
overall
nice
brew
would
i
drink
it
everyday
thats
another
story
to
have
it
every
now
and
then
why
not
its
good
to
throw
something
different
into
the
mix
drink
and
enjoy
salud
poured
surprisingly
pale
and
clear
compared
to
the
other
versions
strawyellow
color
with
a
thin
white

that
dissipated
to
nearly
nothing
aroma
was
herbal
and
slightly
fruity
spicy
with
the
rosemary
taking
a
slight
edge
as
in
the
other
versions
more
of
this
in
the
taste
the
spice
blend
coming
to
the
foreground
lesser
notes
of
somwhat
sweet
pale
malts
light
citrus
herbs
bordering
on
potpourri
light
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
good
in
small
doses
o
complex
and
yet
clean
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
clean
flavors
and
nicely
blended
well
done
collaboration
a
very
subtley
funked
saison
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
overall
a
delicious
and
unique
take
on
a
very
commercially
and
culinary
underrated
style
i
went
in
expecting
a
decent
brew
but
this
is
definitely
a
few
cuts
above
decent
just
like
any
other
saison
this
is
a
great
holiday
feast
beer
try
it
if
you
like
the
style
i
wonder
how
this
recipe
differs
from
dfhs
version
maybe
it
doesnt
except
for
geography
o
its
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
i
would
need
to
seek
out
somewhat
tame
for
the
brewers
involved
in
the
collaboration
o
an
excellent
collaboration
love
a
good
farmhouse
ale
and
all
of
the
herbal
spices
add
an
interesting
character
poured
into
a

and
lacing

aroma
of
bready

especially

with
a
hint
of

bready

nicely
herbal
with
distinct
sage
and
rosemary
finishing
slightly
dry
with
lingering
herbs
light
hops
and
saison
yeast
medium
bodied
very
nicely
made
and
enjoyable
maltier
and
more
heavily
herbal
than
traditional
for
the
style
but
worked
perfectly
for
me
this
is
the
last
of
the
three
versions
ive
tried
and
im
interested
to
see
from
past
reviews
how
much
more
i
like
this
than
the
first
i
tried
victory
ill
have
to
start
the
cycle
again
with
the
victory
version
because
the
higher
ratings
of
the
last
two
are
more
likely
due
to
my
increasing
enjoyment
of
saisons
overall
this
is
very
tasty
saison
took
a
few
sips
to
get
used
to
the
herbs
but
this
beer
became
delicious
to
drink
halfway
through
will
have
to
try
the
other
two
breweries
take
on
this
collaboration
o
somewhat
interesting
but
not
much
of
a
standout
saison
the
best
quality
is
the
earthy
aroma
on
this
beer
for
that
i
can
give
props
to
san
diego
and
this
craft
beer
community
the
beer
pours
a
honey
gold
with
a
disappointing
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
herbal
and
pungent
with
a
modest
honey
sweetness
it
smells
quite
interesting
and
is
definitely
the
most
herbforward
of
the
three
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
freshly
cut
spicy
herbs
sweet
clover
honey
and
a
touch
of
yeast
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
more
bitterdry
than
expected
you
definitely
get
the
intimate
herbal
experience
that
youre
expecting
with
this
beer
over
the
others
its
definitely
the
best
of
the
three
and
worth
trying
o
an
interesting
saison
with
rosemary
and
hops
dominating
that
would
probably
pair
nicely
with
some
garlicky
italian
food
i
loved
the
taste
it
was
very
different
to
me
as
i
have
not
had
too
many
saison
beers
or
any
beers
with
sage
and
thyme
my
two
favorite
spices
the
sage
and
thyme
were
definitely
predominant
throughout
this
beer
i
thought
the
coolest
part
about
this
beer
was
how
the
thyme
brought
out
the
hops
really
cool
stuff
ill
definitely
have
this
again
a
far
far
superior
product
to
the
dogfish
one
it
pours
clearish
for
a
saison
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
prominent
white
head
an
inch
or
two
tall
the
nose
is
real
herbal
floral
and
funky
maybe
a
different
yeast
strain
used
in
this
one
lots
of
peppery
stuff
happening
flavor
is
much
more
herbal
than
the
dogfish
version
the
sage
really
stands
out
to
me
more
than
anything
else
its
fresh
and
light
in
the
mouth
with
excellent
carbonation
and
a
light
medium
body
the
herbs
in
this
beer
make
it
pretty
unconventional
in
taste
and
this
isnt
for
everyone
but
i
thought
their
forwardness
in
this
beer
was
an
improvement
id
like
to
try
the
victory
version
now
to
round
out
the
trilogy
definitely
not
as
hoppy
as
most
stone
brews
and
might
benefit
from
some
more
of
that
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
as
a
single
oi
loiked
this
better
than
the
dfh
version
spices
came
through
more
and
had
a
great
balance
really
enjoyable
cloudy
yelloworange
in
appearance
thin
white
head
clears
quickly
leaving
very
little
sign
of
there
being
any
to
begin
with
smells
like
chicken
stock
which
i
like
lots
of
herbs
like
rosemary
sage
parsley
and
thyme
with
some
lemon
rind
in
there
also
taste
is
kinda
chicken
stockish
but
better
the
herbs
and
citrus
blend
well
to
make
for
a
tasty
treat
mouthfeel
seems
kinda
creamy
and
buttery
carbonation
is
present
on
the
tongue
unlike
in
the
appearance
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
but
not
too
much
overall
this
was
rather
tasty
and
didnt
last
long
so
i
must
of
really
liked
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
ample
white
head
and
great
retention
big
aroma
with
herbs
very
forward
sage
thyme
rosemary
and
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
after
reading
bottle
more
closely
parsley
fruity
esters
also
dominate
with
lemonorange
taste
follows
with
strong
herbal
qualities
sage
and
rosemarry
fruity
esters
here
as
well
with
lemonorang
tang
slightly
spicy
and
sour
as
well
mouthfeel
is
well
balance
with
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
sour
overall
a
great
beer
although
not
your
traditional
saison
o
wow
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
even
remotely
refreshing
i
wonder
what
the
experts
would
pair
this
with
maybe
a
rotisserie
chicken
how
about
a
strawberry
rhubarb
rosemary
popsicle
maybe
if
you
held
the
sugar
at
bay
either
way
this
is
a
savory
beer
that
needs
something
savory
overall
a
unique
and
tasty
take
on
the
style
as
i
mentioned
a
bit
one
demensional
but
still
good
overall
4

definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
really
appreciate
what
these
three
breweries
have
done
its
not
a
perfect
saison
but
its
good
and
its
innovative
i
really
enjoyed
the
different
components
but
at
least
on
the
palate
it
didnt
mesh
perfectlyin
the
end
it
had
a
little
too
much
herbalmedicinal
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
i
think
could
have
gone
in
a
different
direction
if
done
a
little
differently
now
i
just
need
to
try
the
red
wine
barrel
aged
version
o
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
not
something
i
would
want
very
often
may
be
a
good
one
to
pair
with
food
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
a
classic
belgian
saison
im
missing
the
yeast
and
some
of
the
phenols
and
esters
but
the
herbal
stuff
is
aromatic
and
tasty
the
last
of
the
pack
to
be
tried
enjoyed
this
one
as
much
as
dogfish
heads
if
not
more

o
i
think
i
prefer
the
dfh
version
but
its
hard
to
say
as
there
has
been
a
few
months
between
trying
each
version
the
stone
version
has
a
slightly
harsh
flavor
on
the
end
and
the
abv
bump
is
kind
of
odd
different
yeast
maybe
either
its
a
solid
beer
with
a
well
integrated
herb
presence
an
enjoyable
experiencecollaboration
for
sure
o
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
not
something
that
you
would
drink
like
a
session
beer
but
the
herbal
notes
are
very
tasty
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
probably
the
most
enjoyable
part
as
the
smell
is
quite
inviting
im
pretty
sure
this
is
the
stone
version
drinking
it
straight
outta
the
bottle
at
the
pool
aromas
of
pine
floral
hops
sweetness
tastes
of
definite
rosemary
subtle
honey
nice
pale
malts
hoppy
hoppy
smooth
as
eggs
perfect
balance
of
carbonation
i
dig
these
three
breweries
and
i
dig
this
collab
this
is
solid
a
great
saison
with
an
intense
herbal
aroma
and
flavor
the
herbs
remind
me
of
my
grandmothers
kitchen
overall
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
the
only
downside
is
that
the
herbs
become
intense
after
a
bottle
or
two
its
worth
splitting
them
up
a
bitterness
thats
much
like
swallowing
pine
cones
much
more
earthy
than
the
other
2
versions
of
this
and
still
my
favorite
of
the
three
its
exactly
how
i
remember
it
last
time
2010
which
is
ridiculous
because
ive
had
hundreds
of
different
beers
since
then
a
very
unique
taste
mixed
with
a
medium
body
nice
creamy
feel
hits
your
lips
but
still
so
bitter
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
that
you
cant
help
but
want
more
and
more
of
this
an
excellent
saison
series
and
the
best
of
the
best
right
here
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
its
the
most
unique
tasting
saison
i
have
had
to
date
the
herbs
dominate
this
beer
from
beginning
to
end
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
this
beer
doesnt
come
close
to
drinking
as
strong
as
it
is
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
this
beer
would
pair
well
with
poultry
or
work
wonders
in
a
marinadebrine
props
to
three
great
breweries
for
creating
an
interesting
beer
definitely
one
of
the
more
memorable
takes
on
the
saison
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
spiced
beers
but
these
add
more
to
the
great
aroma
rather
than
dominating
the
taste
feels
like
a
real
collaboration
with
each
adding
something
that
adds
up
to
greatness
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
and
maybe
the
best
american
one
poured
a
hazy
light
yellowgold
color
with
a
thick
long
lasting
head
awesome
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
intriguing
strong
herbal
notes
of
rosemary
and
thyme
along
with
other
earthy
and
fruity
notes
light
citrus
taste
is
equally
as
intriguing
all
of
the
herbal
flavor
comes
through
right
up
front
with
more
notes
of
pine
and
very
slight
citrus
flavor
there
is
a
lingering
sweetness
as
well
as
a
slight
hop
bitterness
very
well
balanced
clearly
the
herbs
are
the
star
of
this
beer
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
with
good
mouthfeel
this
really
is
a
good
beer
however
its
just
so
different
i
dont
know
if
im
ready
to
commit
to
have
this
on
multiple
occasions
but
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
just
for
the
experience
the
buff
trio
really
are
trying
to
push
the
envelope
as
far
as
developing
new
beer
trends
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
ointeresting
but
wouldnt
want
to
drink
alot
due
to
the
overpowering
herbs
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
and
flavor
it
for
sure
a
good
collaboration
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
takes
on
this
beer
stone
poured
from
bottle
into
glass
slight
hazey
golden
with
foam
that
is
gone
quick
lots
of
carbonation
really
herbal
and
citrus
hop
aromas
you
really
smell
all
the
herbs
in
this
one
taste
is
typical
saison
funk
but
herbal
and
very
citrus
hop
flavors
its
easy
drinker
and
pretty
tastey
not
amazing
but
not
bad
o
this
was
an
interesting
brew
you
could
even
say
unique
but
is
it
for
the
better
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
im
conflicted
i
dont
think
i
was
satisfied
but
i
encourage
these
sort
of
experimental
beers
it
was
truly
worth
the
price
if
anything
so
with
that
said
i
would
recommend
for
the
experience
but
wouldnt
continue
to
buy
savor
great
beer
overall
not
bad
some
good
qualities
but
the
herbal
focus
is
not
my
thing
o
a
pretty
tasty
beer
it
has
good
flavors
and
nice
complexity
but
isnt
quite
to
style
o
interesting
but
not
necessarily
over
the
top
as
one
might
expect
from
three
particularly
talented
breweries
a
really
nice
domestic
saison
in
my
opinion
and
while
the
herbs
definitely
have
a
presence
it
kind
of
leaves
you
wanting
just
a
little
more
a
fine
beer
none
the
less
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
spice
beer
but
out
of
the
three
saison
du
buffs
i
like
the
the
dfh
the
best
overall
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
i
still
like
more
traditional
saisons
better
oit
was
a
complex
beer
with
a
long
finish
true
to
its
label
it
was
very
herbal
however
that
vegetal
aspect
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
and
i
could
have
used
more
yeastfruit
i
just
dont
think
it
was
for
me
o
ironically
this
was
the
first
of
the
three
saison
du
buff
that
i
tried
but
the
last
i
am
reviewing
this
one
like
the
others
is
big
on
the
herbs
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
but
my
palate
fatigued
of
the
flavors
somewhat
by
the
end
i
would
still
rate
it
just
above
the
dfh
version
in
the
competition
of
interesting
but
mediocre
beers
o
a
nice
rendition
of
a
saison
but
not
something
i
would
look
to
drink
a
lot
of
the
problem
lies
with
the
sage
i
feel
that
they
used
it
a
tad
too
much
and
it
completely
masked
the
other
flavors
that
im
guessing
they
wanted
the
drinker
to
experience
nice
novelty
item
but
thats
about
where
it
ends
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
herbs
and
spices
taste
is
of
malt
grain
herbs
spices
and
yeast
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
i
really
enjoyed
this
version
of
sdb
after
waiting
a
long
time
to
get
ahold
of
this
second
brewing
from
stone
nice
looking
beer
golden
color
crystal
clear
and
with
a
good
head
even
after
20
minutes
some
head
remains
smell
is
bright
with
the
spices
and
a
good
dose
of
lemon
taste
is
enjoyable
very
refreshing
in
addition
to
the
expected
saison
flavor
the
hops
come
through
a
bit
more
in
this
version
that
victory
or
dfh
well
done
overall
very
well
executed
but
not
a
necessarily
a
combination
of
flavors
im
really
looking
for
or
craving
in
a
beer
the
ingredients
list
reads
off
like
something
you
might
use
to
spice
up
ones
spaghetti
sauce
overall
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
no
hint
of
alcohol
distinctly
herbal
as
opposed
to
the
floralcitrusy
flavors
were
familiar
with
from
hops
white
beers
o
if
both
dfh
and
stone
are
involved
always
worth
a
try
very
interesting
tasting
beer
enjoyed
the
spice
combination
as
it
came
through
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
took
the
suggestion
to
try
this
beer
not
knowing
anything
about
it
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
smelled
what
was
in
there
i
knew
that
this
would
be
quite
different
from
beers
ive
previously
tasted
its
a
clear
see
through
gold
liquid
that
adopts
the
colors
of
whatevers
behind
the
glass
it
smells
like
a
garden
the
aroma
of
the
herbs
blend
together
to
make
this
smell
like
a
flower
garden
the
smell
alone
is
relaxing
and
can
take
you
to
a
different
place
the
taste
is
very
unique
i
noticed
the
bottle
doesnt
say
beer
anywhere
but
malt
beverage
the
flavor
of
he
herbs
has
a
stronger
accent
on
the
overall
taste
than
most
recipes
that
youd
see
them
in
this
is
fine
and
pleasant
in
this
case
because
theyre
guided
by
the
light
malt
and
carbonation
that
present
the
herbs
to
your
tongue
the
herbs
still
gently
tingle
on
your
tongue
after
a
sip
is
a
very
nice
beer
for
relaxing
on
a
quiet
day
c
o
a
descent
beer
not
my
favorite
from
stone
and
not
my
favorite
of
the
collaboration
series
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
fans
of
the
saison
style
beer
should
definitely
try
this
one
out
o
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
very
easy
and
refreshing
to
drink
these
breweries
should
do
more
together
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
this
wouldnt
be
an
everyday
saison
for
me
o
this
is
like
curry
in
a
bottle
crazy
ammount
of
developed
spices
other
than
initial
spice
kick
not
a
hole
lot
going
on
though
minimal
malthop
flavors
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
had
nothing
i
would
drink
everyday
but
one
of
the
best
tick
beers
out
there
give
it
a
try
as
i
dont
think
youll
have
anything
similar
overy
unique
saison
and
would
definitely
recommend
to
fans
of
the
style
looking
for
something
different
poured
from
bottle
to
tulip
the
beer
arrives
a
brilliant
golden
color
fairly
opaque
in
nature
with
a
decent
1
5
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
fairly
translucent
the
nose
is
an
aggressive
blend
of
peppery
lemon
yeast
and
herbs
similarly
the
flavor
is
a
punch
of
lemony
pepper
yeast
and
then
an
abundance
of
sage
allspice
rosemary
spice
different
aggressive
but
not
overly
so
mildy
bitter
and
fairly
clean
not
much
hop
character
finishes
a
bit
thin
in
nature
with
a
lingering
herb
flavor
overall
glad
to
have
tried
it
might
go
well
with
a
rosemary
lemon
pepper
chicken
i
enjoyed
it
but
likely
wont
be
back
o
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
when
it
first
came
and
i
am
so
amped
it
came
out
again
easily
my
favorite
saison
i
could
drink
this
all
day
appearance
is
a
light
gold
with
a
white
head
fairly
frothy
it
has
a
nose
which
contains
yeast
sugar
hay
sage
and
other
herbs
taking
a
sip
of
this
saison
and
i
taste
rustic
style
bread
citrus
and
some
soap
it
has
a
mouthfeel
which
is
medium
rather
dry
in
the
finish
a
fairly
sweet
aspect
to
the
finish
as
well
all
in
all
a
solid
saison
which
i
am
happy
to
see
has
hit
the
shelves
again
a
bit
hoppier
than
the
other
versions
of
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
sacrifice
some
of
the
herbal
notes
that
make
it
so
unique
lemon
citrus
and
bitterness
are
welcome
addition
not
up
to
snuff
on
this
collaboration
although
ive
heard
dogfish
heads
buff
is
well
put
together
as
disappointed
as
a
true
saison
lover
may
be
you
have
to
appreciate
stone
victory
and
dogfish
head
for
daring
to
risk
their
street
cred
and
assuming
the
costs
of
such
an
undertaking
this
is
one
different
saison
it
seems
to
me
that
most
other
brewers
try
to
highlight
the
yeast
in
their
saison
but
this
one
really
pulls
it
back
to
showcase
the
herbs
i
could
get
nearly
all
the
herbs
in
the
nose
but
im
wondering
if
id
have
tasted
them
if
i
hadnt
read
the
bottle
its
funny
that
power
of
suggestion
regardless
this
is
a
very
drinkable
delightful
beer
that
id
like
to
see
in
bombers
its
commendable
that
the
brewers
took
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
did
something
different
yet
it
still
fits
the
style
do
not
the
worst
saison
ive
ever
experienced
but
nowhere
near
the
best
not
worth
the
4
49
price
tag
on
this
12oz
bottle
pass
if
only
due
to
the
price
o
an
awesome
saison
only
flaw
is
the
sage
dominates
a
tad
to
much
this
is
a
must
try
saison
imo
sage
rocks
i
almost
want
to
have
this
with
cast
ironedskilleted
pork
chops
with
apples
and
sage
i
love
tgat
brewers
are
experimenting
with
beers
but
this
should
not
be
sold
to
the
public
it
should
just
be
made
available
as
an
experimental
beer
maybe
at
the
breweries
themselves
i
think
im
done
with
saison
beer
in
general
pours
a
hazy
pure
golden
yellow
with
a
creamy
two
fingers
of
head
leaving
thick
curtains
in
its
wake
wow
the
nose
hits
you
straight
away
with
its
bouqet
garni
strong
coriander
seed
right
away
wild
fennel
strong
licorice
scent
that
you
would
smell
when
hiking
in
the
bay
area
along
with
a
wet
earthiness
as
well
nothing
like
i
have
spelled
before
very
intriguing
though
not
necessarily
what
i
want
from
a
beer
also
there
is
a
layered
hint
of
belgian
yeast
spice
as
well
the
mouth
brings
all
the
herbs
together
which
is
impressive
to
taste
all
the
flavors
thats
its
made
with
though
to
me
thats
not
a
good
thing
as
im
not
the
biggest
herb
fan
in
the
world
coriander
sings
first
with
sage
coming
in
right
behind
it
holding
till
the
end
with
a
wisp
of
rosemary
showing
itself
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
good
and
refreshing
and
somewhat
cleans
up
the
herbage
on
the
finish
a
well
made
beer
though
not
my
taste
whatsoever
note
to
the
purists
who
dont
like
reviews
that
dont
live
up
to
their
standards
stuff
it
overall
a
great
beer
with
an
amazing
list
of
odd
ingredients
which
seem
to
work
very
well
together
i
loved
it
and
am
looking
forward
to
this
and
further
releases
d
a
good
drinker
and
wellcrafted
plenty
of
depth
but
nothing
is
the
least
bit
overwhelming
it
doesnt
come
off
as
a
kitchen
sink
brew
either
it
works
perhaps
my
least
favorite
beer
from
stone
i
did
not
like
this
though
it
was
more
of
an
interesting
experienceexperiment
than
it
was
a
bad
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
one
of
those
beer
that
is
better
then
its
individual
parts
oamazing
how
well
this
has
held
up
over
time
bravo
d
very
drinkable
one
of
the
most
unique
and
amazing
beers
ive
ever
had
great
credit
goes
to
the
3
brewers
o
better
than
i
anticipated
unique
would
go
great
with
pizza
d
not
what
i
expected
at
all
better
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
so
complex
but
incredibly
refreshing
i
just
hope
i
can
hunt
down
another
bottle
this
is
the
first
beer
to
really
excite
me
in
a
while
poured
all
head
at
first
white
and
slow
to
drop
theres
an
immediate
strong
hoppy
smell
like
a
strong
ipa
body
is
a
hazy
yellow
tasty
is
both
hoppy
and
herby
and
considering
it
has
a
spice
cabinet
of
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
in
it
no
wonder
finish
is
too
bitter
im
not
sure
where
they
get
off
calling
this
a
saison
because
the
flavor
isnt
really
from
the
yeast
or
malt
so
much
as
the
spices
and
although
other
saisons
might
have
zest
or
peppery
spicing
they
dont
go
down
the
savory
route
like
this
example
saisons
are
supposed
to
be
refreshing
beers
brewed
for
farm
hands
whereas
this
is
more
of
a
savory
broth
id
target
to
the
autumn
d
very
drinkable
the
spice
addition
to
the
saison
style
makes
for
a
pretty
solid
beer
maybe
not
a
traditional
saison
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
from
notes
tasted
in
midaugust
2010
from
bottle
at
lush
roscoe
pours
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
retains
good
lace
nose
has
that
signature
saison
dustiness
and
hint
of
sweetness
with
the
added
element
of
sage
strongly
hitting
the
nose
the
palate
has
a
nice
bread
flavor
with
some
bittering
hops
and
then
moving
to
that
hard
to
miss
sage
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
finish
dominated
by
sage
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
a
good
but
not
the
most
interesting
saison
the
herbs
dont
intrude
in
this
one
like
in
the
other
two
i
like
it
fine
d
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
saison
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
collaboration
between
three
amazing
craft
breweries
however
the
intensity
of
the
lemon
notes
and
its
one
dimensionality
have
me
longing
for
a
belgian
saisonfarmhouse
fantome
mmm
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
the
pour
was
nice
enough
nice
golden
color
and
a
very
white
head
with
nice
loft
to
it
unfortunately
the
rosemary
destroys
this
beer
very
powerful
aroma
and
flavor
that
just
overwhelms
everything
else
very
singular
note
here
sharp
and
herbal
in
the
mouth
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
this
will
probably
be
the
last
saison
i
drink
but
hey
i
gave
it
a
try
do
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
is
a
doozythe
smell
does
it
no
favorsbut
if
the
drinker
can
allow
their
palate
to
acclimate
then
it
may
become
a
thoroughly
different
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
saison
style
aside
from
the
unconventional
qualities
developed
by
the
herbal
amendments
this
beer
is
remarkably
cleanso
much
so
that
one
would
not
immediately
believe
that
belgian
yeast
was
responsible
for
its
fermentation
i
liked
this
beer
much
more
one
year
on
than
when
it
was
young
better
late
than
never
if
it
took
that
long
to
become
acclimated
to
or
accepting
of
o
overall
a
nice
take
at
the
style
and
maybe
a
bit
better
than
the
or
examples
o
excellent
experience
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
two
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
saison
not
exactly
what
im
looking
for
when
i
go
in
search
of
a
saison
but
interesting
nonetheless
i
also
have
the
victory
version
lined
up
for
this
evening
as
well
im
looking
forward
to
comparing
the
two
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
belgian
yeast
lemonsoranges
and
some
pepper
the
flavor
is
more
complex
and
completely
different
i
get
a
ton
of
herb
notes
in
the
beer
mainly
rosemary
and
thyme
but
possibly
some
other
herbs
as
well
i
also
get
a
lot
of
wheat
pepper
ginger
and
yeast
notes
while
there
are
a
ton
of
flavors
present
something
about
them
doesnt
sit
quite
right
with
me
the
flavor
is
a
little
bit
of
a
mess
but
still
enjoyable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
hey
pizza
in
a
bottle
why
not
herbaceous
i
think
its
like
ouzo
you
like
it
or
you
dont
i
like
it
it
reminds
me
of
beers
from
three
floyds
like
rabid
rabbit
and
gumballhead
the
herbs
are
exited
by
the
carbonation
and
the
wheatiness
this
is
a
very
good
lawn
mower
beer
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
its
also
a
very
good
food
beer
try
it
with
chicken
marinated
in
goya
mojo
criollo
and
slow
roasted
on
the
grill
drinks
pretty
well
but
this
particular
hasnt
really
wowd
me
o
easy
to
drink
feels
light
and
would
be
nice
to
drink
during
a
cookout
im
not
too
familiar
with
saisons
and
am
hoping
from
this
type
of
brew
down
the
road
d
very
easy
drinker
could
have
this
again
a
really
well
put
together
collaboration
brew
the
cpj
drinkability
one
is
enough
for
me
a
little
too
lopsided
i
was
on
the
fence
on
whether
i
liked
this
or
the
stone
version
more
at
first
but
when
i
think
of
which
i
would
rather
have
again
in
the
future
i
think
it
would
be
the
victory
t
something
a
bit
medicinal
about
it
the
herbs
are
well
balanced
by
some
sweet
malts
and
not
allowed
to
take
the
taste
over
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
d
great
taste
lots
of
lemon
zest
a
little
prickly
in
mouthfeel
but
very
workable
abv
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
very
clear
very
pale
yellow
with
a
small
head
and
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
amazingly
strong
with
cooking
spices
fresh
parsley
and
mint
with
plenty
of
cage
some
clove
some
cardamom
the
whole
spice
rack
indeed
the
flavor
has
some
lemongrass
and
mild
spiciness
the
beer
is
nicely
dry
and
bitter
with
some
parsley
and
sage
the
palate
is
a
little
thin
nice
enough
beer
starts
with
a
sweet
citrus
and
spicy
it
milds
and
finishes
dry
with
a
dry
mouth
the
spices
present
themselves
and
finishes
bitter
much
like
youd
get
from
licking
a
lemon
on
a
spring
evening
this
was
still
a
good
choice
and
an
interesting
experience
overall
id
pick
this
up
again
if
they
continued
to
brew
it
but
really
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
collab
pours
a
golden
hue
that
reminds
me
of
wheat
but
is
a
bit
more
ambertoned
almost
a
figer
of
frothy
bubbly
uneven
head
which
doesnt
seem
huge
for
a
saison
but
looks
very
nice
very
hazy
with
small
carbonation
bubbles
mingling
around
the
glass
and
larger
ones
streaming
in
a
variety
of
sizes
and
at
a
variety
of
speeds
to
the
top
of
the
glass
very
strong
smella
bit
like
bells
hopslam
oddly
with
only
a
few
herbal
saison
notes
that
im
picking
out
pleasant
enough
smells
like
itll
get
a
lot
funkier
as
it
warms
and
is
pretty
nice
tastes
good
love
what
they
did
with
the
stylecreativity
mouthfeel
is
absolutely
awful
and
inconsistent
drinks
smoothly
on
a
nice
springlike
day
drinkability
is
just
average
for
me
i
can
finish
one
and
if
there
was
nothing
else
maybe
a
second
in
a
social
situation
but
if
its
just
me
at
the
computer
or
watching
tv
one
would
be
plenty
i
had
stones
version
and
initially
considered
trying
the
other
ones
if
i
could
find
them
still
on
shelves
but
after
making
it
most
of
the
way
through
this
one
i
think
ill
pass
d
i
love
whats
going
on
here
but
i
gotta
say
ones
enough
very
very
interesting
concept
just
too
much
concept
a
complex
deliciously
flavored
beer
great
to
enjoy
regularly
or
with
a
good
dinner
d
i
would
like
to
taste
the
actual
beer
instead
of
an
herb
garden
im
curious
if
the
other
versions
are
at
all
different
but
not
terribly
so
ive
been
interested
in
this
beer
since
i
first
read
about
it
and
im
glad
i
tracked
it
down
it
is
even
better
than
i
expected
one
of
the
best
most
interesting
saisons
ive
had
it
would
pair
very
well
with
food
pours
golden
with
the
most
head
of
the
three
a
bit
murkier
than
the
others
smells
strongly
of
rosemary
actually
and
thyme
more
balanced
than
the
others
a
bit
overfly
carbonated
but
definitely
the
best
of
the
three
mouthfeel
decent
pours
a
chillhazed
goldenrod
with
a
threefinger
plume
of
dense
offwhite
head
that
takes
several
minutes
and
several
pours
to
fill
the
glass
properly
aroma
is
golden
malts
coupled
with
a
heavy
helping
of
both
rosemary
and
sage
which
imparts
a
sweet
and
zesty
quality
the
parsley
and
thyme
are
much
less
forward
flavor
is
very
similar
very
herbal
and
green
with
a
flabby
pale
malt
baseline
finishes
dry
from
tannic
astringency
and
id
be
lying
if
i
said
the
high
carbonation
wasnt
distracting
body
is
too
thick
and
sweet
for
the
style
perhaps
dfh
was
in
charge
of
the
attenuation
process
in
this
collaboration
drinkability
im
not
really
sure
i
was
able
to
drink
this
glass
pretty
fast
but
i
may
need
some
time
to
drink
about
whether
i
would
want
this
again
or
maybe
i
just
need
to
explore
the
style
a
little
bit
more
yet
another
collab
this
time
between
dogfish
head
and
victory
fresh
herbs
and
attitude
clear
golden
orange
and
the
lacing
impresses
herbs
in
the
nostrils
in
this
order
rosemary
sage
thyme
and
parsley
crisp
medium
body
a
little
bitty
dry
maltiness
meets
a
slightly
chalky
yeast
herbs
are
very
forward
and
all
over
the
palate
alcohol
shows
up
with
a
dried
fruit
flavor
and
some
warmth
in
the
back
baste
a
chicken
or
drink
with
one
vive
la
american
saison
d
perfect
i
could
have
many
of
these
taste
is
dominated
by
the
aromatics
sage
thyme
pepper
one
of
the
most
complex
and
interesting
saisons
i
have
ever
had
poured
light
bright
adn
full
of
life
nice
head
decent
lacing
and
just
pretty
made
with
herbs
and
they
were
very
present
in
the
aroma
along
with
lemon
zest
and
slight
funk
very
fresh
and
lively
both
in
aroma
and
in
taste
all
the
herbs
are
present
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
lemon
zesty
yeast
flavors
grass
and
some
earth
again
this
is
a
lively
beer
in
every
way
and
its
having
a
party
in
my
mouth
i
was
told
that
i
was
dirnking
the
2nd
to
last
one
in
london
so
after
i
finished
i
had
the
what
was
said
to
be
the
last
bottle
i
would
drink
mor
eif
i
could
find
more
really
a
beautiful
beer
md
medium
bodied
with
just
a
hint
of
chewy
wheatiness
excellent
carbonation
carries
the
beer
through
and
the
alcohol
is
not
at
all
noticeable
until
a
light
warming
at
the
end
given
the
wide
array
of
tastes
flying
around
i
still
find
the
beer
rather
drinkable
not
sure
it
is
somethign
i
love
but
it
is
definitely
interesting
and
not
something
i
would
turn
down
in
mhe
future
d
an
ok
beer
that
could
likely
improve
considerably
with
a
few
tweaks
i
poured
this
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
and
was
greeted
with
a
short
lived
white
fizzy
head
sitting
on
top
of
a
extremely
orange
bodied
brew
the
aroma
was
like
sweet
oranges
with
a
lot
of
herbs
thrown
in
for
luck
i
mean
some
herbs
sage
rosemary
parsley
and
pepper
i
thought
i
was
a
cooking
a
thanksgiving
turkey
flavor
wise
i
got
pretty
much
the
same
thing
a
big
old
herbal
mess
not
to
much
saison
flavoring
going
on
in
other
words
a
little
bit
of
herbs
go
a
long
way
it
had
a
medium
feel
in
my
mouth
and
good
carbonation
i
think
drinking
the
12
oz
bottle
was
enough
for
me
there
was
just
to
much
going
on
this
is
a
bold
and
flavorful
saison
there
is
complex
spiciness
and
intricate
flavors
although
no
distinct
or
dominant
single
herbal
flavor
there
is
nice
subtlety
to
this
beer
its
dry
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
has
nice
citrus
and
belgian
undertones
body
is
nicely
carbonated
but
not
overly
bubbly
and
not
velvety
like
a
true
belgian
saison
finish
is
nice
and
dry
why
is
quite
true
to
style
while
an
interesting
experiment
i
think
this
beer
suffers
a
little
from
too
many
flavors
jockeying
for
position
nonetheless
try
it
if
you
see
it
its
worth
the
experience
gorgeous
golden
yellow
with
a
marshmallow
fluff
head
white
and
soapy
and
stalwart
the
aroma
is
everything
youd
hope
for
a
roast
chicken
without
the
chicken
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
with
more
than
a
little
grapefruit
for
good
measure
a
whopping
quenelle
of
mango
sorbet
and
some
crackers
in
the
background
superfocused
citricherbal
flavor
without
a
tremendous
amount
of
nuance
but
whats
there
is
delightful
tangerine
and
grapefruit
laden
with
holy
basil
and
kaffir
lime
purple
sage
and
lemon
thyme
round
and
meandering
yet
somehow
snappy
and
focused
deliriously
tasty
a
wonderful
beer
in
spite
of
its
soapy
overtones
d
very
drinkable
this
should
be
available
in
6packs
all
year
long
one
of
the
most
unique
and
amazing
beers
ive
ever
had
major
props
to
all
three
brewers
serving
type
bottle
12
ounce
bottle
pours
slightly
hazy
bright
amber
color
with
a
1
5
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
and
good
lacing
aromas
of
malts
rosemary
and
sage
dominating
with
floral
hops
taste
is
strong
of
rosemary
and
parsley
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
spices
sit
on
the
palate
for
quite
a
while
after
the
finish
very
interesting
beer
never
had
anything
like
this
before
solid
i
enjoyed
it
a
very
intriguing
beer
but
i
feel
like
it
fails
to
meet
the
intended
goal
it
seems
a
bit
messy
but
overall
its
not
bad
still
i
walk
away
a
bit
disappointed
drink
the
2nd
of
3rd
in
the
vertical
so
far
1
of
2
for
a
saison
it
was
extremely
clear
and
light
in
color
no
cloudiness
and
closer
to
a
yellowish
orange
than
a
deep
orange
large
white
foamy
head
and
beautiful
lacing
golden
color
light
crisp
very
drinkable
flavor
the
nose
is
a
strong
citrusy
and
sage
like
hop
aroma
but
without
the
strong
bitterness
hops
in
the
taste
a
unique
spin
on
a
saison
style
that
is
light
and
refreshing
would
definitely
buy
a
6pack
of
this
if
they
had
it
amazingly
complex
a
real
foodie
saison
worthwhile
personally
i
thought
this
collaboration
was
nice
in
theory
but
fell
short
in
execution
stone
however
brought
on
a
beer
id
try
multiple
times
its
a
very
herbforward
saison
but
seems
more
well
integrated
and
balanced
than
the
victory
very
fresh
and
clean
lighter
medium
body
dry
and
a
little
bitter
feel
drinks
pretty
nicely
alcohol
is
masked
well
enough
although
it
was
a
bit
sweet
overall
for
me
3
0
d
none
of
the
versions
are
that
good
but
i
think
id
probably
pick
this
one
it
has
the
best
overall
traits
though
a
bit
more
carbonation
is
needed
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
even
though
it
seems
a
lot
like
a
witbier
if
youre
into
the
spicy
flavor
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
drinkability
is
great
given
this
brews
experimental
nature
really
liking
this
style
lately
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
poured
a
hazy
incandescent
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
lasted
the
entire
time
but
the
smell
oh
my
god
what
happened
to
this
beer
sure
theres
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
in
it
its
an
awesome
combination
on
chicken
or
in
scarborough
fair
but
this
is
awful
it
smells
like
someone
took
a
spice
bag
added
some
herbs
to
it
and
boiled
it
in
a
pilsner
then
threw
brettanomyces
in
there
and
let
it
ferment
a
couple
months
spice
tea
gone
bad
ugh
this
is
unbearable
sorry
stone
victory
and
dfh
i
love
you
guys
but
this
was
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
from
any
of
you
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
racing
go
the
top
a
persistent
thin
white
head
hangs
on
for
the
duration
aroma
is
very
herbal
and
the
taste
follows
suit
this
is
a
unique
saison
i
would
typically
associate
these
flavors
with
cooked
meat
but
they
work
very
well
in
this
beer
body
is
light
very
enjoyable
brew
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
while
im
not
that
rounded
with
saisons
is
seems
like
a
pretty
unique
brew
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
in
the
next
few
days
will
be
trying
the
victory
and
dogfish
versions
the
citrus
touch
makes
this
stand
out
against
the
vic
both
are
very
nice
but
this
one
gets
the
nod
by
a
hair
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
not
one
to
be
gulped
or
tossed
back
if
youre
going
to
try
this
beer
you
need
to
really
put
your
heart
into
it
you
need
to
let
yourself
be
taken
over
by
the
aromas
and
quality
of
the
seasonings
at
the
same
time
dont
take
this
craft
brew
too
seriously
it
is
the
epitome
of
summer
after
all
i
would
recommend
pairing
this
with
grilled
chicken
maybe
with
a
lemon
marinade
to
further
enhance
the
lemon
hiding
in
the
beer
and
dont
forget
the
herbs
whoa
this
is
extreme
brewing
herbs
galore
reminds
me
of
the
13th
century
gruit
bier
hops
define
a
difference
as
it
is
very
bracing
on
the
palate
minty
even
high
carbonation
grainy
malts
and
heavy
hop
load
makes
it
a
complex
sipper
that
makes
you
think
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
this
all
the
time
but
it
sure
is
a
helluva
ride
while
it
lasts
like
drinking
granny
deweys
herb
garden
fun
fun
fun
get
one
if
you
can
find
it
we
still
have
some
in
the
store
drinkability
i
was
pretty
surprised
and
enthralled
by
this
brew
i
wasnt
anticipating
that
it
would
be
a
mess
but
with
so
much
going
on
i
also
didnt
think
it
would
come
together
this
well
sessionable
complex
delicious
and
a
fantastic
experiment
overall
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
if
they
all
keep
it
up
note
this
beer
gave
me
a
violent
case
of
the
hiccups
crazy
hiccups
i
cant
stop
seriously
old
wives
tales
are
no
match
for
these
hiccups
d
refreshing
although
the
spices
are
just
slightly
too
aggressive
d
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
liked
quite
a
bit
easy
to
drink
with
its
good
taste
worth
finding
to
give
it
a
try
d
very
unique
flavor
with
the
use
of
the
herbs
light
bodied
and
an
especially
easy
drinker
highly
sessionable
a
well
crafted
beer
that
just
doesnt
really
fit
my
palate
cant
really
point
any
fingers
just
maybe
a
tad
astringent
to
me
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
for
everybody
pours
a
moderate
gold
color
with
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
nose
really
brings
out
a
lot
of
herbs
with
the
sage
and
rosemary
being
the
most
prominent
a
bit
of
zesty
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
pretty
herbforward
as
well
with
a
bit
of
zest
and
spice
feel
is
nice
as
the
herbs
present
a
good
bitterness
drinkability
is
a
bit
poor
as
all
the
strong
herbs
are
a
bit
much
in
the
end
d
easy
drinker
but
i
can
see
why
others
might
not
enjoy
definitely
tasty
imo
pours
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
sage
nose
flavor
is
sour

a
lingering

oh
so
drinkability
4
d
if
i
were
to
make
a
hop
salad
and
serve
it
with
some
sourdough
bread
i
think
this
about
what
it
would
taste
like
a
very
unique
treat
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
dfh
goblet
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
half
inch
loose
offwhite
head
embedded
with
tiny
pinpricks
head
eventually
settles
into
a
skim
with
a
dense
dollop
in
the
middle
and
slashes
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
huge
sage
presence
reminiscent
of
the
russian
sage
growing
in
my
garden
as
well
as
rosemary
and
a
suggestion
of
citrus
taste
follows
nose
extremely
herbal
and
slightly
bitter
and
acidic
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
an
acidity
that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
finish
is
semidry
an
interesting
beer
but
herbal
qualities
are
a
bit
overpowering
a
six
ounce
pour
was
more
than
sufficient
this
beer
is
best
split
amongst
two
or
three
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
a
wildly
creative
beer
and
its
well
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
bought
a
few
and
im
glad
that
ill
have
a
chance
to
try
this
in
multiple
situations
drinkability
unique
for
the
style
tasty
d
my
final
beer
of
the
trilogy
seemed
to
be
much
like
the
dfh
version
for
some
reason
the
victory
was
much
different
and
inconsistent
with
the
others
overall
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
collaboration
by
the
three
breweries
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
hazy
golden
yellow
orange
with
a
massive
four
finger
head
that
came
right
to
the
brim
of
my
tulip
and
settled
down
to
two
fingers
very
very
slowly
the
head
also
had
a
nice
fluffypillowly
appearance
to
it
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
subtle
hop
banana
subtle
oregano
and
other
spices
the
flavor
was
of
spices
bitter
malt
slight
hops
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
it
takes
a
little
bit
for
your
palate
to
adjust
to
it
but
once
it
does
the
flavors
are
very
nice
the
only
downside
is
that
it
has
too
many
flavors
going
on
at
once
rather
than
having
them
come
on
individually
from
each
other
to
keep
changing
my
palate
it
almost
seems
to
explode
sometimes
shockandawe
tactics
work
but
in
the
case
of
this
brew
it
did
not
md
very
herbal
as
expected
and
medium
bodied
was
the
last
of
the
three
i
had
and
probably
my
middle
choice
its
well
done
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
night
saison
du
buff
is
interesting
beer
its
also
delicious
and
drinkable
especially
given
the
rather
unconventional
ingredients
heres
hoping
the
dogfish
head
and
victory
versions
are
at
least
this
good
theres
no
reason
to
think
they
wont
be
overall
this
saison
was
heavy
on
the
herbs
but
somehow
the
light
malt
profile
made
it
work
worth
a
shot
had
hight
expectations
for
this
one
when
i
first
heard
about
it
and
overall
it
doesnt
dissapoint
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
massive
aroma
that
comes
with
this
beer
massive
aroma
of
rosemary
sage
and
parsley
and
other
spices
and
there
is
a
lot
of
funk
going
on
here
the
taste
is
citrussy
tangey
and
real
spicy
very
complex
and
impressive
not
the
most
drinkable
largely
because
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
definitely
pick
it
up
if
you
can
find
it
overall
its
a
fairly
bitter
and
herbal
beer
but
it
still
seems
to
offer
a
pretty
good
amount
of
drinkability
unless
you
let
it
warm
the
herbaceous
character
is
pretty
much
kept
in
check
and
theres
a
solid
bitterness
there
that
helps
to
cut
it
short
in
the
finish
i
could
easily
see
drinking
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
yet
theres
still
a
good
deal
of
complexity
to
it
nicely
done
d
so
great
i
was
blown
away
by
this
i
wish
all
saisons
were
this
tasty
this
is
truly
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
that
i
really
hope
that
they
will
brew
again
really
wonderful
overall
i
am
bowled
over
with
this
one
really
a
sublime
beer
that
defines
style
perfect
beer
for
a
perfect
drinkability
was
the
downfall
with
what
to
me
was
an
overpowering
pine
or
herb
taste
that
just
wasnt
enjoyable
i
wished
i
had
ordered
any
other
beer
that
i
had
already
tried
there
is
a
nice
bright
lemon
note
in
the
nose
that
doesnt
quite
translate
to
the
flavor
it
is
interesting
how
much
this
smelled
like
it
was
aggressively
hopped
during
my
first
few
smells
of
the
nose
especially
when
all
this
came
from
the
herbs
with
a
touch
of
yeast
character
thrown
in
yeah
this
beer
is
magic
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
is
quite
deliciousl
it
tastes
like
tree
sap
honey
lemon
and
chewed
bubble
gum
with
a
mouth
feel
of
tingly
butterflies
smells
very
citrusy
with
no
hops
really
present
an
amazing
session
beer
if
it
wasnt
five
dollars
a
bottle
i
would
never
buy
it
myself
but
nonetheless
delicious
very
interesting
but
the
spicing
is
way
overdone
and
kills
the
drinkability
overall
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
the
three
breweries
involved
pours
the
expected
hazy
golden
huge
herbal
scent
and
flavor
nice
mouthfeel
as
one
would
expect
from
a
saison
i
think
the
rosemary
note
overwhelms
what
i
hoped
would
be
a
slightly
more
crisp
flavor
but
im
not
disappointed
because
you
have
to
expect
these
breweries
to
push
the
brew
in
a
new
direction
a
novelty
saison
dont
think
id
orderbuy
another
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
dogfish
head
snifter
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
big
4
inch
white
cap
that
leaves
pretty
significant
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
lemon
rind
a
little
grass
and
a
whole
lot
of
herbal
the
rosemary
and
the
thyme
are
really
prevalent
massive
herbal
notes
the
flavor
is
very
similar
its
really
herbal
rosemary
up
front
and
thyme
finishing
on
the
back
end
in
the
middle
is
lemon
grass
very
herbal
light
on
the
hops
light
on
the
malts
but
huge
on
the
spice
cabinet
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
disappointing
it
finishes
really
full
and
sweet
saisons
should
finishes
at
least
somewhat
dry
this
one
should
have
fermented
out
just
a
little
more
to
me
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
saison
nothing
spectacular
this
is
a
collboration
beer
between
stone
victory
and
dogfish
head
pours
a
hefeweizenlike
cloudy
lemonadeish
color
lightly
carbonated
and
has
a
very
short
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
heavily
loaded
with
rosemary
but
has
a
real
tuscan
shape
to
it
overall
kind
of
like
the
spice
that
makes
a
good
fricasse
some
citrusy
notes
in
there
too
keeping
with
the
style
not
bad
but
im
not
a
huge
herbed
beer
guy
flavor
is
very
herbal
lots
of
the
thyme
sage
rosemary
notes
but
im
not
getting
the
parsley
very
good
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
very
bitter
in
a
bad
way
on
the
finish
the
herbal
notes
dont
diminish
at
all
wellpriced
at
2
9912oz
bottle
though
so
that
brings
the
drinkability
up
a
lightbodied
and
crisp
ale
but
not
really
sessionable
because
the
herbal
notes
are
overpowering
they
likely
accomplished
their
goal
with
this
but
its
not
up
my
alley
worth
trying
for
its
unique
qualities
and
many
of
you
might
like
it
particularly
if
paired
with
a
tuscan
meal
brewed
wiht
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
going
into
this
but
the
savory
herbs
were
wonderfully
woven
through
the
flavor
profile
rather
than
a
novelty
beer
this
is
something
i
could
see
rotating
through
my
beer
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
id
love
to
have
a
bottle
at
thanksgiving
a
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
beer
is
refreshing
lingers
on
the
palate
a
little
too
long
for
my
tastes
for
a
saison
but
is
otherwise
a
good
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
is
nice
on
a
warm
evening
like
tonight
overall
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
three
different
batches
i
feel
like
stone
played
with
the
herb
addition
timing
more
than
the
other
breweries
this
one
was
layered
very
nicely
a
very
interesting
beer
that
if
i
revisit
i
will
be
doing
under
stones
interpretation
d
amazing
unlike
any
saison
ive
ever
had
find
two
and
save
one
for
later
d
this
was
a
bit
much
for
me
a
bit
rugged
and
not
very
quaffable
i
suppose
i
like
more
str8
forward
saisons
final
verdict
while
victory
looked
and
smelled
better
i
enjoyed
the
taste
of
dfh
and
while
i
would
i
would
never
turn
either
down
i
would
take
dfh
by
a
slim
margin
d
although
it
is
a
great
idea
i
dont
feel
that
it
really
came
together
as
nicely
as
stone
may
have
expected
it
to
in
this
brew
i
probably
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
as
the
herb
punch
was
a
bit
too
much
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
offering
its
worth
picking
up
to
try
before
it
is
gone
tough
to
say
about
this
brew
it
definitely
isnt
like
a
lot
of
saisons
out
there
and
i
dont
think
it
is
representative
of
the
style
however
the
innovation
involved
is
impressive
this
one
definitely
isnt
for
everyone
but
if
you
fancy
yourself
any
kind
of
slight
beer
enthusiast
it
is
worth
buying
a
bottle
more
interesting
than
good
freedom
from
convention
here
supersedes
respect
for
tradition
best
served
with
food
but
otherwise
avoided
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
cause
im
a
huge
fan
of
all
three
breweries
this
was
quite
a
tasty
beer
a
unique
saison
and
one
of
the
better
collaborative
brews
that
stones
put
out
it
was
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
big
bubbled
head
that
dissolved
quickly
looked
like
it
had
some
fizz
to
it
flavor
was
nice
and
fruity
dominated
by
big
herbal
flavors
of
rosemary
and
possibly
other
not
surprisingly
theres
a
bit
of
stone
hoppiness
orange
some
yeast
and
wheat
in
there
a
very
light
and
fizzy
brew
sort
of
a
combo
between
an
imperial
pilsener
and
a
saison
tasty
and
unique
with
the
herbs
in
there
crisp
smooth
throughout
with
good
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
while
the
herbs
make
it
unique
it
also
makes
it
something
i
couldnt
drink
too
much
of
pours
a
luminous
golden
color
with
slight
haze
and
white
head
nose
has
a
very
appetizing
herbal
quality
with
lemon
creme
on
the
palate
the
herbal
qualities
dominate
and
the
sweetness
i
anticipated
was
not
there
it
was
rather
peppery
too
with
a
good
mouthfeel
bite
and
finished
peppery
as
well
d
nice
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
bit
odd
overall
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
too
much
in
a
sitting
warmed
up
a
bit
and
with
the
yeast
it
gets
a
good
deal
better
and
easier
to
drink
d
pretty
good
jd
a
tasty
and
unique
take
on
the
style
but
not
something
i
could
drink
everyday
i
remember
the
dfh
version
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
as
being
a
bit
less
bitter
and
more
balanced
so
ill
have
to
revisit
it
a
worthy
brew
and
i
applaud
them
for
the
creativity
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
is
very
challenging
to
finish
though
overall
i
am
exceptionally
pleased
with
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
in
bottle
perhaps
that
will
be
on
the
menu
this
evening
if
you
see
this
beer
get
it
its
limited
and
is
worth
trying
and
if
you
live
within
radius
to
moes
call
to
see
if
its
still
on
tap
v8
is
great
but
not
in
a
carbonated
beverage
drinkability
this
one
is
tough
its
a
good
beer
just
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spices
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
as
i
love
the
beers
that
each
of
the
three
breweries
make
but
this
one
just
goes
overboard
with
a
good
thing
worth
a
try
certainly
but
theres
no
way
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
the
herbs
really
come
through
in
the
mouth
particularly
the
rosemary
and
sage
surprisingly
bitter
and
instantly
paralyzing
to
the
tongue
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
cant
taste
anything
else
its
ok
though
because
this
is
creative
and
enjoyable
what
i
come
to
expect
from
a
saison
is
no
where
to
be
found
here
to
help
this
its
almost
as
if
someone
took
carbonated
water
and
added
spices
and
hop
juice
to
it
great
to
smell
and
look
at
but
average
everywhere
else
fairly
drinkable
but
more
intense
than
other
farmhouse
ales
ive
quaffed
however
as
a
limited
run
beer
its
drinkability
doesnt
matter
much
because
i
doubt
ill
ever
find
it
again
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
interesting
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
too
much
of
a
mishmash
of
spices
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
impressive
and
spice
filled
showing
considerable
honey
clove
sage
and
rosemary
while
the
flavor
profile
generally
replicates
the
nose
on
tap
i
found
the
spices
to
be
a
bit
over
the
top
there
just
wasnt
enough
sweet
honey
and
clove
flavors
to
handle
the
amount
of
spice
i
encountered
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
to
full
with
a
long
moderately
sweet
spice
filled
finish
drinkability
wasnt
too
bad
but
again
the
amount
of
spice
in
this
beer
really
wore
on
me
after
a
while
i
just
thought
it
a
bit
too
prominent
and
dominant
in
this
otherwise
interesting
well
made
beer
great
summer
beer
crisp
and
carbonated
with
lots
of
zest
the
bubbly
beer
is
what
i
call
it
with
lots
of
carbonation
which
is
great
on
a
hot
day
i
could
definitely
taste
layers
of
herbs
rosemary
beginning
followed
by
hints
of
parsley
and
thyme
overall
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
db
yes
this
is
sort
of
unbalanced
yes
it
tastes
like
a
spice
rack
that
is
the
point
of
the
beer
with
that
in
mind
i
judge
it
to
be
that
way
and
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
it
isnt
offensive
the
rosemary
and
thyme
notes
are
fulfilling
and
fresh
a
good
summer
beer
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
d
a
unique
take
on
the
saison
style
friendly
and
inviting
unique
and
worthy
of
a
try
though
im
note
sure
i
would
ever
indulge
in
this
on
a
regular
basis
taste
is
somewhat
tart
yeast
malt
a
little
sweetness
in
the
back
grass
some
crisp
citrus
and
spice
d
the
tartherbal
combination
is
interesting
but
this
is
a
pretty
atypical
saison
absolutely
too
bad
its
a
oneoff
this
collaborative
beer
is
a
nice
saison
very
light
and
drinkable
just
not
my
style
of
beer
that
i
enjoy
d
very
drinkable
with
alcohol
at
a
reasonable
and
quite
interesting
i
can
also
guarantee
that
this
beer
would
pair
so
perfectly
with
a
huge
range
of
foods
im
thinking
herb
lasagna
pesto
roast
turkey
beef
or
chicken
even
hamburgers
fish
and
chips
chili
or
pizza
would
be
an
amazing
accompaniment
for
this
unique
and
exciting
beer
i
am
very
excited
to
see
what
the
next
two
versions
will
produce
drinkability
is
high
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
get
palate
fatigue
from
the
herbs
done
very
nicely
worth
replicating
at
home
since
i
have
a
nice
supply
of
fresh
rosemary
in
the
garden
thoughts
the
brewmasters
all
did
a
great
job
on
this
i
love
all
the
flavors
and
their
balance
is
incredible
big
up
to
axic10
on
this
one
pours
golden
wheat
color
with
a
billowing
rocky
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
left
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
wild
with
definite
notes
of
rosemary
and
sage
as
well
as
nice
wafty
yeasty
notes
flavor
is
well
what
you
would
expect
very
herbacious
peppery
and
a
good
bit
hoppy
for
a
saison
not
too
much
yeast
driven
flavor
hear
well
on
second
try
there
is
a
little
it
is
dry
however
which
is
nice
for
what
it
is
it
drinks
well
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
i
think
i
will
revisit
this
one
before
summer
is
out
on
a
hot
as
day
with
thai
food
drinkabilitythis
beer
pushes
the
limit
of
spices
that
are
included
in
a
saison
with
all
of
these
spices
i
bet
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
make
beer
can
chicken
with
if
you
dont
like
rosemary
this
is
not
for
you
d
this
is
a
very
cool
beer
unlike
anything
ive
had
i
couldnt
have
more
then
one
or
two
not
because
of
the
taste
but
because
you
would
be
unable
to
appreciate
it
after
one
or
two
i
would
like
to
see
this
become
a
seasonal
beer
i
picked
a
few
bottles
of
the
dogfish
head
and
the
stone
versions
i
have
yet
to
come
by
the
victory
but
will
pick
up
if
i
see
it
while
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
all
its
interesting
and
different
tastes
12oz
is
just
enough
for
me
could
never
have
more
than
one
but
it
is
good
enough
that
you
need
a
whole
12
oz
to
completely
enjoyappreciated
this
beer
good
collaboration
but
lets
not
start
mass
producing
this
gents
simply
an
a
on
all
counts
the
taste
rolls
on
for
ages
and
this
scent
will
haunt
me
until
tomorrow
when
i
get
more
this
is
not
your
grandfathers
saison
as
far
as
improving
on
dupont
i
have
no
comment
but
this
is
an
incredible
concoction
that
i
could
not
ask
more
from
good
work
boys
d
saison
to
me
is
a
strange
style
with
all
its
odd
characteristics
and
i
think
i
would
like
it
much
more
if
the
hops
werent
so
acrid
and
astringent
the
herbal
additions
are
cool
but
also
novelty
and
i
would
probably
give
a
no
thanks
if
another
one
were
offered
to
me
better
to
give
it
to
someone
who
hasnt
yet
had
a
chance
to
try
this
rare
however
ridiculous
offering
bottle
poured
a
dark
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
primarily
sage
with
a
sweet
malt
base
with
candylike
feature
which
surprisingly
works
well
together
taste
is
also
a
very
unique
mix
between
a
sweet
malt
base
with
candy
and
soap
notes
and
a
distinctive
sage
finish
with
other
spices
also
coming
through
body
is
quite
light
for
style
but
seems
perfect
in
this
case
as
it
makes
this
a
very
refreshing
drink
a
lot
better
then
i
had
anticipated
and
something
i
would
seek
again
for
sure
d
omg
i
could
drink
this
every
day
and
night
for
the
rest
of
my
life
a
truly
wonderful
brew
my
hats
off
to
the
three
amigos
that
crafted
this
fine
concoction
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
an
over
the
top
fluffy
white
head
carbonation
galore
lots
of
sticky
lacing
aromas
of
grassy
hops
herbs
and
malt
on
the
palette
is
where
this
saison
shines
with
as
plethora
of
spices
pine
cloves
coriander
sage
lemon
zest
and
pepper
predominate
medium
bodied
with
tons
of
carbonation
a
true
trifecta
well
done
two
thumbs
up
d
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
with
this
but
it
turned
out
alright
probably
could
have
used
a
little
less
spice
though
as
i
found
it
a
little
hard
to
finish
just
one
bottle
glad
to
try
but
not
sure
id
drink
again
really
really
like
this
beautiful
but
discrete
bottle
with
a
beautiful
beer
inside
really
happy
i
wasnt
disappointed
makes
me
want
to
try
and
brew
something
similar
would
buy
this
again
and
would
love
to
try
to
try
more
beers
with
these
type
of
herbs
added
thanks
and
kudos
to
all
3
breweries
d
really
nice
though
it
still
feels
like
a
gimicky
saison
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
this
beer
has
alot
going
for
it
definately
unique
and
worth
checking
out
d
a
little
to
minty
and
grassy
to
drink
much
of
happily
split
this
bottle
could
probably
drink
a
whole
one
but
not
much
more
interesting
beer
and
i
wouldnt
expect
less
with
dogfish
involved
d
an
interesting
beer
the
relatively
odd
flavors
advertised
on
the
bottle
show
through
but
remain
subtle
allowing
this
to
still
be
an
enjoyable
beer
finger

of
frothy

to

cinnamon
catch
first
in
the
nose
but
its
just
a
second
before
the
noted
herbs
take
over
white
grapefruit
too
yeasty
but
not
soft
nor
leesy
witchhazel
nothing
here
overly
malty
leafiness
predominates
extremely
long
presence
with
a
full
pungent
lift
mediumbodied
nicely
balance
with
same
amount
of
fullness
from
start
to
finish
the
herbs
once
more
dominate
and
there
is
a
clear
strong
note
of
basil
as
well
nothing
crazy
about
the
carbonation
level
but
it
does
add
to
the
total
cleanliness
factor
the
tangerine
to
pink
and
white
grapefruit
lend
a
sweet
and
sour
juiciness
slight
yeast
to
bakers
dough
element
much
more
savory
ending
and
aftertaste
good
deal
of
retronasal
activity
hard
to
imagine
an
oddball
oneoff
succeeding
much
better
than
this
drinkability
good
d
very
easy
to
drink
one
bottle
however
by
the
end
of
my
glass
i
remember
feeling
as
if
i
had
just
ate
a
salad
of
herbs
and
didnt
feel
like
having
anymore
maybe
just
me
but
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
just
over
the
top
md
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
slightly
prickly
very
drinkable
for
me
wasting
away
in
a
hot
house
with
no
ac
very
refreshing
this
wouldnt
make
my
saison
short
list
but
its
certainly
a
good
beer
d
i
plan
to
try
all
three
just
for
comparisons
sake
but
i
wouldnt
keep
this
in
stock
due
to
the
nature
of
the
herbs
this
is
an
interesting
saison
to
put
it
mildly
but
from
these
brewers
anything
too
traditional
would
be
disappointing
well
done
will
try
to
pick
up
at
least
one
from
each
brewery
really
interesting
but
for
me
more
of
a
novelty
its
well
executed
for
what
it
is
but
not
really
practical
for
me
to
drink
on
any
regular
basis
i
wouldnt
even
want
a
whole
bottle
necessarily
another
solid
collab
though
drinkability
a
very
interesting
brew
but
the
aftertaste
is
too
medicinal
and
leaves
it
lacking
compared
to
the
other
versions
of
this
beer
44344
drinkabilty
is
fair
im
thinking
it
would
go
nicely
with
a
meaty
fish
or
perhaps
a
nicely
grilled
chicken
i
appreciate
what
the
collaboration
did
here
in
trying
to
push
the
envelope
its
an
interesting
and
good
beer
but
a
bit
too
herbal
which
overwhelms
what
is
probably
a
good
saison
under
there
this
was
an
interesting
beer
thats
packed
with
aroma
and
flavor
it
reminds
me
of
a
gruit
more
than
a
saison
saison
is
not
a
style
im
very
familiar
with
this
beer
is
exceptionally
herbal
in
aroma
and
taste
the
rosemary
sage
and
parsley
it
was
brewed
with
help
explain
that
but
the
hops
are
the
outstanding
herb
and
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
resinous
which
i
appreciate
the
color
is
light
hazy
yellowits
a
visually
attractive
beer
along
with
the
herbal
piney
hopes
the
defining
character
for
me
is
what
id
call
belgian
funk
this
might
not
have
been
the
obvious
choice
of
style
for
stone
and
dogfish
to
brew
together
but
by
my
lights
it
is
a
creative
and
wellcrafted
beer
well
done
drinkability
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
while
its
not
great
or
the
style
it
is
very
enjoyabledrinkable
ill
probably
pick
up
another
bottle
ifwhen
i
see
it
recommended
notes
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
have
had
it
a
few
times
and
it
makes
a
wonderful
marinade
for
chicken
super
herbal
saisons
or
any
styles
really
are
always
very
hit
ie
rabbid
rabbit
or
miss
ie
great
lakes
grassroots
with
me
surprisingly
this
one
is
neither
i
dont
love
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
either
it
falls
pretty
much
in
the
middle
its
pretty
good
although
not
something
i
would
drink
with
any
regularity
an
interesting
beer
a
very
nice
saison
from
these
guys
nice
golden
color
tons
of
carb
bubbles
kicking
off
the
bottom
give
this
one
a
lively
look
big
frothy
sticky
white
head
is
the
clincher
for
this
one
looking
great
smell
starts
off
surprisingly
fruity
some
orange
peal
apricot
smell
quickly
moves
to
spicy
coriander
being
the
highlight
pepper
sage
and
a
full
complement
of
others
kick
in
to
give
this
one
incredible
complexity
taste
matches
the
smell
in
complexity
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
ever
had
as
good
as
expected
from
this
all
star
team
of
brewing
thanks
for
hooking
me
up
cisco
pours
a
very
light
orange
yellow
color
with
a
huge
3
finger
head
unmistakenly
clear
with
a
golden
yellow
apple
color
the
lacing
is
ridiculous
on
this
thing
too
aroma
is
great
i
really
get
a
spicy
sage
aroma
on
this
one
basil
thyme
parsley
on
the
backend
a
sweetness
from
the
herbal
notes
really
plays
perfect
with
this
one
really
a
perfect
nose
taste
is
spot
on
too
really
has
that
nice
spicy
floral
herbal
thing
going
on
here
full
bodied
saison
with
a
nice
oily
back
note
to
give
this
body
mouthfeel
falls
a
bit
short
as
the
carbonation
is
lacking
a
bit
herbal
oils
take
away
from
the
crispness
of
this
slightly
drinkability
is
high
very
delicious
and
does
wonders
with
food
wish
this
came
in
larger
format
bottles
for
sharing
d
i
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
the
abv
is
nonexistent
as
you
drink
it
kind
of
regret
only
buying
one
at
least
its
easy
to
get
here
drinks
like
a
salad
it
was
light
crisp
refreshing
and
would
be
the
perfect
predinner
beverage
i
found
this
incredibly
easydrinking
though
the
subtleties
of
flavor
are
diminished
when
paired
with
food
best
to
enjoy
this
one
all
on
its
own
d
this
is
such
an
interesting
experience
full
of
interesting
spices
but
they
dont
detract
from
the
brew
seems
like
with
ever
sip
the
flavor
changes
this
would
be
great
to
pair
with
some
aged
gouda
purchased
a
bottle
for
4
at
bwx
in
downtown
crossing
served
in
a
tulip
style
glass
hazy
yellow
colored
body
excellent
sized
white
head
that
remained
intact
for
some
time
plus
some
good
lacing
smell
is
where
you
first
start
to
notice
the
herbs
its
like
sticking
your
nose
in
a
garden
unusual
and
i
kind
of
like
it
taste
was
not
as
overpowering
as
the
smell
may
suggest
all
of
the
flavor
profiles
of
a
well
built
saison
were
there
including
hay
and
fresh
bread
the
herbs
were
pronounced
on
the
palate
but
added
to
the
unique
flavor
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
was
also
quite
good
as
it
had
the
tart
crispness
of
a
farmhouse
ale
drinkability
may
not
be
off
the
charts
due
to
its
interesting
flavor
but
it
was
tasty
and
refreshing
i
can
see
how
some
people
may
not
like
this
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
must
be
nice
paired
with
an
herb
salad
simon
garfunkel
would
be
so
proud
or
so
litigious
whichever
it
pours
an
almost
clear
somewhat
hazy
golden
straw
topped
by
a
morethanhealthy
couple
fingers
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
a
dichotomous
mixture
of
wheat
and
citrus
assaulted
by
a
a
horde
of
windowbox
garden
spices
must
be
the
sg
canticle
spices
the
spices
return
to
dominate
the
tongue
as
well
providing
more
than
enough
garnish
for
the
dish
both
literally
and
figuratively
some
citrus
flies
in
behind
them
but
this
is
quickly
quashed
by
a
strong
earthyspicy
collaboration
still
though
the
herbsspices
maintain
their
ironclad
grip
on
the
situation
this
is
the
first
time
ive
experienced
a
sammichs
filling
be
completely
oershadowed
by
the
bread
honestly
i
think
i
find
it
a
bit
too
much
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
i
gotta
say
i
am
underwhelmed
by
this
brew
brewing
with
the
windowbox
greens
is
fine
but
i
dont
think
they
should
dizzominate
the
proceedings
like
they
do
here
d
the
herbs
make
this
beer
very
undrinkable
to
me
i
dont
know
how
these
three
breweries
were
ableto
work
together
with
that
much
talent
in
the
room
i
have
to
say
they
were
successful
in
bringing
the
best
of
each
of
them
into
one
very
tasty
saison
starts
off
odd
as
from
the
appearance
and
aroma
im
left
expecting
an
ipa
aroma
is
very
crisp
and
fresh
dominated
by
herbal
and
floral
notes
with
mild
citric
hops
and
slight
medicinal
pinch
appearance
is
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
massive
foamy
and
rocky
white
head
that
leaves
billowy
patches
of
lace
and
a
persistent
thick
layer
of
film
and
bubbles
with
a
large
foamy
splotch
in
the
middle
given
the
description
of
ingredients
for
this
beer
the
flavor
isnt
very
surprising
but
certainly
isnt
a
let
down
as
this
is
very
unique
but
is
it
any
good
front
of
the
palate
is
gripped
by
a
citric
almost
dipa
like
flavor
though
not
remotely
bitter
moving
back
the
palate
a
unique
musty
earthiness
dominated
by
herbal
and
floral
flavors
body
is
medium
thick
mildly
creamy
with
strong
fine
carbonation
that
tries
to
clean
up
some
of
the
sweet
and
herbal
mess
of
the
body
very
little
about
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
a
saison
and
im
usually
not
crazy
about
herbal
and
medicinal
flavors
but
im
strangely
enjoying
this
beer
the
only
thing
detracting
from
the
drinkability
of
this
is
the
long
lingering
dry
aftertaste
that
is
dominated
by
sage
and
other
earthy
spices
as
with
all
the
stone
collabs
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
im
necessarily
motivated
to
revisit
not
a
lot
of
traditional
saison
character
but
that
clearly
wasnt
the
point
had
a
nice
balance
of
herbs
tartbitterness
and
funk
unique
and
delicious
successful
experiment
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
all
that
said
ultimately
this
is
one
of
many
beers
that
hits
really
high
notes
great
feel
really
worthwhile
aromas
and
flavors
but
also
messes
up
a
few
times
this
soapiness
is
overboard
and
the
really
busy
aromas
and
flavors
ruinously
clash
from
time
to
time
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sage
stands
out
and
other
spices
are
in
there
too
in
the
taste
spicy
yeasty
and
a
small
tartness
a
spicy
bite
and
a
small
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
spicy
and
small
tart
aftertaste
nice
spiciness
like
the
small
tart
and
different
spices
used
d
an
unparalleled
saison
in
terms
of
stretching
your
imagination
but
the
drinkability
is
average
only
points
given
for
creativity
points
taken
for
creativity
some
hits
and
misses
all
within
this
one
brew
sure
this
beer
is
innovative
although
right
brain
brewery
did
a
better
version
last
year
but
the
flavors
just
dont
mesh
too
well
the
rosemary
sage
and
thyme
are
nice
but
i
swear
the
parsley
which
dominates
with
grassy
chlorophyll
was
just
thrown
in
to
match
the
simon
and
garfunkel
song
and
while
i
generally
love
saisons
the
slight
sourness
makes
everything
even
more
confusing
while
this
is
appealing
from
a
novelty
perspective
palate
fatigue
sets
in
about
halfway
through
one
beer
d
i
had
to
try
it
im
glad
i
did
and
im
glad
this
one
was
priced
reasonably
saison
du
buff
really
impressed
me
oftentimes
these
stone
collaboration
brews
are
hit
or
miss
much
like
the
weirder
dogfish
stuff
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
things
to
come
out
of
the
lab
in
a
while
blame
victorys
calming
influence
if
you
like
but
this
is
a
winner
highly
recommended
a
delightfully
fun
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
ok
the
herbs
were
definitely
interesting
and
made
for
a
very
unique
beer
but
im
not
sure
its
a
flavor
id
want
often
in
a
beer
cool
beer
that
was
definitely
worth
trying
though
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
have
been
looking
for
this
since
i
first
read
about
it
and
i
have
finally
found
it
on
the
east
coast
a
little
disappointing
for
being
a
collaboration
between
stone
dfh
and
victory
but
still
good
beer
and
worth
the
price
if
you
can
find
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
medium
white
head
smells
of
freshly
squeezed
lemon
and
phenolic
yeast
taste
is
light
bread
like
malt
up
front
with
a
very
spicy
herbal
lemon
middle
and
finish
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
here
the
clings
to
your
toungue
mouthfeel
is
good
slightly
high
carbonation
very
good
beer
other
than
the
fact
that
the
intense
spicyness
limits
drikability
a
bit
i
would
get
this
again
though
overall
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
to
date
i
love
the
fruity
addition
not
commonly
as
prominent
in
others
mostly
due
to
the
herbs
brewed
with
this
i
assume
also
the
phenols
present
are
a
bit
different
than
you
find
in
hennepin
or
dupont
would
love
to
buy
again
albeit
a
tad
pricey
d
its
a
pretty
hot
day
here
in
portland
and
this
was
crazy
satisfying
had
two
bottles
while
i
roasted
some
lamb
doused
in
olive
oil
and
sea
salt
d
very
enjoyable
tart
crisp
and
vanishes
off
the
tongue
quickly
with
very
good
results
a
surefire
summer
time
quencher
that
comes
highly
recommended
per
style
case
worthy
drinkability
is
great
id
drink
a
lot
of
these
fantastic
beer
overall
everything
i
expected
from
a
collaboration
of
brewers
of
this
caliber
highly
recommend
it
to
everyone
the
smell
alone
is
worth
buying
this
beer
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
this
on
my
next
trip
to
the
beer
store
d
i
wasnt
expecting
much
looking
at
the
ingredients
of
this
beer
but
im
surprised
how
well
they
actually
worked
very
unique
and
interesting
flavor
like
chewing
mint
bubblegum
you
dropped
in
a
muddy
herb
garden
glad
i
tried
it
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
eggshell
head
that
retains
impressively
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
fresh
hay
and
bread
dough
upfront
along
with
white
pepper
floral
hops
spices
thyme
rosemary
parsley
a
little
honey
and
mineral
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
biscuit
and
hay
initially
along
with
some
white
pepper
spicy
hops
rosemary
sage
cardamom
a
little
honey
some
fruity
esters
and
a
little
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
and
drinkability
is
good
but
a
little
limited
by
the
prevalence
of
spices
an
interesting
saison
here
definitely
heavier
on
the
spices
that
most
examples
ive
tried
i
was
first
drawn
to
this
brew
when
i
noticed
who
had
collaborated
on
it
the
herbs
really
are
the
main
feature
of
this
beer
they
take
over
the
taste
of
this
brew
and
deliver
something
so
unique
to
your
palette
nice
head
for
this
one
and
it
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
aroma
is
spicy
and
matches
the
flavor
of
this
beer
perfectly
as
my
first
saison
i
have
to
admit
im
very
impressed
and
ill
be
looking
for
a
few
of
these
to
stock
my
fridge
when
i
can
dthis
is
one
heck
of
an
interesting
beer
its
hands
down
the
best
saison
ive
had
to
date
this
isnt
a
terribly
easy
to
drink
beer
though
as
i
fee
like
after
one
or
two
of
these
youd
get
some
hardcore
palate
fatigue
from
the
herbs
either
way
i
am
not
getting
quite
the
malt
flavor
or
the
levity
i
expect
in
a
saison
a
little
disappointing
i
will
drink
the
beer
and
appreciate
the
novelty
but
probably
not
pick
this
one
up
again
if
only
it
had
lived
up
to
the
smell
d
its
been
a
long
time
since
a
beer
caught
me
completely
off
guard
what
an
outstanding
collaboration
in
any
case
big
points
for
creativity
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
is
the
amazing
aroma
of
the
hops
when
you
pour
it
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
complex
hoppiness
and
light
mouthfeel
there
are
also
some
sweet
fruit
flavors
on
the
backend
all
round
great
beer
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
you
would
be
drinking
a
lot
of
but
it
is
certainly
enjoyable
with
or
with
out
food
d
definitely
a
great
experience
not
something
to
be
over
consumed
but
as
a
drink
alone
its
a
great
overall
taste
and
texture
and
refreshing
on
top
of
that
d
i
like
spice
in
my
beer
i
also
love
saison
beers
this
beer
is
a
combination
of
two
things
that
i
love
which
only
proves
that
sometimes
too
much
of
a
good
thing
actually
can
be
too
much
i
do
think
its
good
but
i
also
think
the
spiciness
is
a
bit
harsh
and
could
use
a
little
less
bitterness
on
the
finish
as
well
d
this
was
a
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
the
aroma
and
appearance
was
better
than
the
overall
flavor
the
rosemary
in
this
beer
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
moreso
after
the
beer
itself
warms
up
would
love
to
try
this
again
d
the
nice
saison
with
strong
american
hops
has
an
interesting
herbal
twist
with
mint
and
rosemary
that
is
not
over
the
top
but
interesting
the
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
spot
on
overall
this
is
just
unfortunately
not
a
good
beer
d
a
mindblowing
beer
thats
all
i
have
to
say
drinkability
this
is
a
superb
beer
and
probably
the
best
saison
i
have
had
i
hesitated
a
little
to
buy
this
beer
at
first
but
i
am
very
glad
i
ended
up
purchasing
it
if
you
havent
already
tried
this
beer
you
definitely
should
strongly
recommended
d
i
dont
know
that
this
wins
me
over
from
the
traditional
farmhouse
saisons
but
i
certainly
applaud
the
effort
to
push
the
boundaries
and
try
something
new
this
is
my
second
bottle
and
im
bound
to
get
a
couple
more
and
since
theyre
bottleconditioned
keep
at
least
one
for
a
while
to
see
what
develops
a
try
recommendation
is
an
easy
call
dits
a
unique
offering
but
not
as
crazy
or
intense
as
the
description
says
the
flavorings
blend
well
and
nothing
is
too
overpowering
a
bit
gimmicky
perhaps
but
its
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
light
airy
and
good
solid
drinkable
beer
d
quite
a
tasty
treat
this
one
is
a
hit
to
me
if
the
next
buff
collab
is
even
half
as
good
as
this
one
ill
buy
it
this
one
is
great
and
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
well
worth
the
3
99
per
12
ounce
that
i
paid
drinkability
this
is
a
oneoff
beer
and
youll
most
likely
never
get
a
chance
to
taste
anything
like
it
again
to
get
it
while
you
can
what
i
find
incredible
about
this
beer
is
that
its
use
of
herbs
is
right
on
target
making
a
statement
without
going
overboard
it
begs
many
questions
for
tweaking
i
hope
see
more
collaborations
like
this
in
the
future
d
an
interesting
saison
that
makes
it
very
clear
it
was
brewed
with
a
lot
of
different
spices
glad
i
tried
it
and
different
but
a
little
too
much
spice
in
the
taste
for
me
would
have
liked
more
going
on
wouldnt
seek
out
again
i
was
really
excited
to
hear
about
this
collaboration
between
stone
victory
and
dfh
thats
three
world
class
operations
the
end
result
is
a
good
saison
its
rather
aggressive
with
the
spices
and
herbs
but
it
never
seems
to
go
over
the
top
not
for
me
anyway
fortunately
it
doesnt
have
a
vegetal
flavor
in
the
mix
overall
im
impressed
unless
youre
averse
to
spicyherbal
saisons
check
this
one
out
clear
gold
with
a
dense
white
cap
about
a
half
inch
after
the
pour
clumpy
lacing
good
head
retention
citrus
and
fruit
aroma
lots
of
oranges
and
grapefruit
pineapple
powdery
peppery
a
little
bready
with
mild
cloves
and
alcohol
the
flavour
is
cleaner
than
the
aroma
but
a
little
less
intriguing
for
it
the
same
character
is
present
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
crackery
malt
light
spiciness
just
a
little
more
subdued
lingering
fruit
mild
warmth
as
it
goes
down
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
dry
a
little
creamy
nice
texture
overall
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
ill
probably
hopefully
grab
a
couple
more
before
theyre
gone
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
with
a
nice
white
head
good
retention
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
a
huge
mix
of
different
herbs
i
get
rosemary
and
maybe
some
thyme
and
pepper
taste
is
really
strong
on
the
spicing
maybe
a
bit
too
much
so
lots
of
herbal
flavour
to
go
with
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
carbonation
is
spot
on
i
think
the
over
spicing
of
this
is
a
bit
to
its
detriment
but
still
a
fine
beer
d
immensely
refreshing
and
goes
down
far
too
easy
i
could
go
through
a
few
pints
of
this
in
an
afternoon
without
even
blinking
i
use
seasoning
blend
for
duck
confit
sage
salts
thyme
rosemary
and
garlic
this
beer
would
be
perfect
d
a
flat

drinkability
complex
and
flavorful
yet
refreshing
and
quaffable
alcohol
is
not

the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
rosemary
and
thyme
with
a
mild

a
flavor
akin
to
wet

takes
over

even
this
really
is
an

for
the

they
could
have
used
practically
any

the

just
whelmed

sweetness

theres
some
ripe

drying

bitter

theres

carbonation
is
high
making
this
crisp
on

palate
despite
the
flavors
this
is
just
a
touch
watery
too
very
herbal
interesting
unique
but
not
something
im
interested
in
revisiting
my
12oz
bottle
did
not
prove
to
be
a
bother
at
all
cheers
to
stone
dfh
victory
for
this
great
collab
brew
i
got
this
beer
as
a
4th
of
july
present
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
lots
of
herbs
on
the
nose
sage
with
bit
of
funk
the
herbs
blend
with
some
lemon
and
make
an
interesting
taste
after
the
initial
sip
the
herbs
take
a
back
seat
to
a
pleasant
grassiness
it
is
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
an
interesting
brew
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
drinkability
is
also
hurt
as
a
result
of
the
lack
of
balance
a
shame
really
as
good
examples
of
the
style
are
one
of
the
best
examples
of
combining
drinkability
and
complexity
this
one
has
some
complexity
little
subtlety
and
average
drinkability
at
best
d
this
fit
nicely
as
something
to
sip
on
a
very
hot
day
after
cutting
the
grass
the
tart
notes
would
take
the
edge
off
the
heat
outside
of
that
id
rather
have
an
ipa
eta
not
that
it
matters
but
the
artwork
on
the
label
leaves
much
to
be
desired
which
is
surprising
as
dogfish
head
stone
and
victorys
labels
are
usually
topnotch
i
had
moderately
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
seems
to
be
another
collaboration
that
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
the
good
ones
continue
to
be
few
and
far
between
drinkability
really
interesting
take
on
the
saison
style
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
other
two
versions
compare
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
i
tried
it
because
it
was
a
oneoff
collaboration
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
its
like
eating
cardamoms
to
me
though
so
not
something
id
buy
again
delicious
complex
and
very
sessionable
not
exactly
something
youd
want
to
start
your
night
with
if
you
were
thinking
of
trying
some
lighter
fare
as
theres
a
lot
going
on
there
but
still
very
approachable
many
of
my
nonbeerdrinker
friends
really
really
enjoyed
this
one
good
job
you
triumvirate
you
cant
wait
to
see
how
you
fine
tune
the
next
one
d
this
one
wont
appeal
to
everyone
but
i
think
its
a
drinkable
beer
taste
and
mouth
are
a
little
heavier
than
expected
the
finish
lingers
and
isnt
bad
for
a
saison
this
is
to
hoppy
i
think
with
some
age
this
will
do
much
better
are
you
brewing
of
scarborough
fair
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
who
would
think
of
something
this
out
there
probably
sam
cologne
none
the
less
it
is
quite
refreshing
it
pours
pale
with
a
thick
foamy
head
smells
like
ground
up
herbs
tastes
quite
strongly
of
mint
and
hops
i
have
never
encountered
anything
else
like
it
that
is
beer
feels
sudsy
and
bubbly
to
the
tongue
very
very
drinkable
i
hope
dogfish
and
stone
get
together
again
at
some
point
preferably
on
a
russian
imperial
stout
dquite
good
i
am
enjoying
this
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
very
thirst
quenching
hope
to
find
some
more
of
it
again
not
strictly
traditional
but
a
solid
brew
d
this
was
a
very
interesting
novelty
beer
but
it
wasnt
something
i
would
drink
more
than
once
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
but
it
was
better
to
sip
given
all
the
unique
flavors
a
fun
experiment
that
i
could
appreciate
even
if
it
didnt
yield
the
most
delicious
results
bottle
at
coles
mikes
private
collection
great
lace
on
light
body
the
aromas
are
a
delightful
funky
and
fresh
more
complex
as
i
drink
it
and
that
has
to
be
done
sip
by
sip
the
herbs
lead
to
a
soup
of
tastes
still
lemony
and
bitter
with
white
paper
and
the
rosmary
and
sage
above
average
mouthfeel
and
approachable
by
averge
a
good
idea
on
paper
i
like
the
concept
that
said
i
feel
like
there
is
just
a
bit
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
too
busy
and
kinda
messy
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
collaboration
from
3
of
my
favorite
brewers
perfect
golden
pour
with
a
foamy
white
head
lots
of
hops
and
citrus
in
the
nose
atypical
for
the
style
but
very
mouthwatering
tangerine
pineapple
and
peaches
dominate
the
taste
which
come
with
a
grassy
hoppy
aftertaste
and
citrusy
bitterness
wow
a
great
tasting
and
unique
brew
comes
out
like
a
marriage
between
an
american
ipa
and
a
saison
this
brew
is
a
treat
and
must
be
sought
out
immediately
this
was
good
and
very
interesting
but
insanely
spicy
so
one
at
a
time
d
this
is
a
winner
for
me
i
am
big
fan
of
all
three
breweries
and
was
nervous
when
i
heard
the
styleingredients
for
a
oneoffor
threeoff
by
the
time
they
are
finished
i
was
not
let
down
i
think
people
may
have
expected
a
monster
hopbomb
from
these
heavyhopped
hands
but
i
was
surprised
when
it
was
a
beer
outside
their
comfort
zones
i
would
not
say
this
is
a
must
but
if
you
enjoy
a
changeup
give
this
a
shot
while
it
is
around
d
pretty
easy
drinking
like
many
of
the
brews
in
this
style
a
unique
brew
for
sure
the
spices
used
in
this
are
readily
noticeable
in
the
taste
and
smell
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
need
to
pick
this
one
up
again
before
it
disappears
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
perfectly
carbonated
and
well
done
for
the
summer
season
consequently
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
feel
like
i
can
taste
each
brewery
contribution
in
this
beer
from
victorys
golden
monkey
and
dogfish
heads
midas
touch
to
stones
your
not
worthy
bitterness
from
some
great
hoppedness
perfect
for
this
summer
if
you
can
get
some
i
highly
recommend
it
wonderfully
complex
and
superbly
drinkable
with
the
bonedry
finish
practically
screaming
for
more
i
had
no
real
idea
what
to
expect
going
into
this
beer
being
brewed
by
some
of
the
biggest
names
in
american
craft
brewing
it
seemed
like
it
could
go
one
of
two
ways
overlyhyped
too
commercial
and
overall
lackluster
or
spectacularly
brilliant
and
it
seems
that
these
guys
pulled
it
off
and
created
a
wellcrafted
and
amazingly
delicious
brew
d
this
is
a
decent
saison
overalla
very
good
dry
summer
beer
i
would
like
to
taste
a
little
more
funkyeast
and
a
lot
less
euro
maltwhich
imo
kinda
kills
the
mood
good
overall
and
worth
a
try
d
this
one
says
its
deliciously
herbacious
on
the
back
and
its
definitely
herbacious
too
bad
most
of
the
herb
is
covered
by
the
lemon
and
actually
ends
up
being
rather
chalky
and
unpleasant
fruitiness
is
appreciated
though
an
very
pretty
beer
to
say
the
least
the
the
finish
and
aftertaste
are
too
aggressive
on
the
palate
worth
a
try
since
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
pours
cloudy
golden
with
a
light
fluffy
head
looks
really
good
aroma
is
spicyfloral
with
a
hint
of
herbs
taste
is
powerful
lightly
bitterhoppy
with
spicy
grassy
herbal
perfume
notes
medium
bodied
moderately
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
also
herbal
mobile
review
d
a
well
crafted
brew
id
definitely
have
another
certainly
timed
correctly
for
summer
this
is
a
refreshingcomplex
beer
and
one
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
all
in
all
i
like
this
brew
its
a
lot
different
from
the
kona
coffee
porter
i
like
obviously
but
its
still
very
good
as
that
one
is
this
to
me
is
a
good
example
of
a
saison
id
say
hunt
this
down
once
just
to
try
if
you
cannot
get
it
in
your
area
12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
orange
with
a
nice
frothy
eggshell
head
that
is
slow
to
diminish
and
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
spices
with
lemon
zest
in
the
front
with
some
pepper
and
rosemary
present
as
well
there
is
also
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
as
well
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
fruits
and
lemon
citrus
with
a
nice
hop
backbone
that
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
quite
light
smooth
and
refreshing
just
about
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
saison
certainly
a
worthy
collaboration
brew
d
as
i
said
before
it
starts
alright
but
continues
to
go
down
hill
and
gets
all
simon
and
garfunky
get
it
anyway
overall
the
drinkability
takes
a
big
hit
in
my
book
as
the
flavors
just
become
more
muddy
as
it
warms
and
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
glass
i
wouldnt
go
for
a
second
in
one
sitting
but
all
said
defiantly
worth
trying
though
the
price
makes
going
for
a
second
try
less
appealing
really
interesting
definitely
something
i
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
but
i
was
and
it
was
great
d
its
solid
would
be
great
to
have
with
a
meal
for
sure
on
its
own
can
only
drink
maybe
one
or
two
great
beer
under
the
right
conditions
definitely
try
it
a
saison
well
done
im
glad
to
see
that
i
liked
this
one
however
the
taste
was
awesome
hops
with
herb
blended
citrus
makes
this
a
saison
i
could
see
always
wanting
if
it
wasnt
so
limited
the
spiced
herbs
hit
the
pallet
first
with
a
large
hop
punch
leaving
a
after
taste
of
rosemary
citrus
and
hops
compliments
to
the
chefs
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
style
and
pretty
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
i
like
the
experimentation
but
this
one
for
me
was
a
miss
for
the
price
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it

i
think
overall
if
youve
never
had
a
spice
herb
or
vegetable
beer
this
is
a
very
good
place
to
start
the
beer
nicely
demonstrates
that
herbs
normally
thought
of
solely
for
cooking
can
be
successfully
applied
in
brewing
the
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
are
surprisingly
high
considering
theyre
not
recognizable
in
the
aroma
in
fact
i
wouldnt
mind
if
the
hops
were
backed
off
a
little
to
ellet
the
spices
come
through
even
more
what
can
i
say
its
what
you
might
expect
from
such
a
collaboration
a
very
unique
beer
tasting
experience
the
aromas
are
fantastic
it
was
just
a
little
too
salty
in
places
to
make
me
really
want
another
one
this
is
something
that
must
be
tried
drinkability
despite
the
bitterness
i
am
very
intrigued
with
the
citrus
taste
and
want
more
of
it
overall
this
is
not
what
i
would
call
a
saison
i
really
loved
this
beer
regardless
but
i
do
think
it
should
be
relabeled
a
great
brew
from
three
of
my
standby
breweries
if
it
were
a
seasonal
or
yearround
and
a
bit
cheaper
too
i
would
buy
this
much
more
than
once
d
although
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
doubt
i
would
be
able
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkability
this
is
definitely
something
i
can
have
a
couple
of
bought
in
a
single
bottle
its
not
a
good
beer
for
someone
that
doesnt
enjoy
a
lot
of
flavor
or
is
just
looking
for
a
straight
up
unfiltered
beer
the
undertones
of
spice
are
very
noticeable
i
do
have
to
say
the
high
price
is
a
turn
off
on
all
these
special
beers
that
have
been
coming
out
lately
its
almost
enough
to
chase
someone
to
drink
hard
liquor
this
is
increcibly
drinkable
i
know
this
is
probably
atypical
of
saisons
but
this
is
my
favorite
saison
to
date
it
goes
down
easy
everything
meshes
waaay
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
night
poured
this
into
a
tulip
not
as
much
head
on
this
straw
colored
beer
as
i
though
there
would
be
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
and
decent
lacing
smells
great
just
like
a
fresh
herb
garden
the
thyme
is
really
what
shines
through
the
nose
along
with
citrus
and
a
bit
of
a
spicy
kick
i
dont
really
taste
the
herbs
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
but
this
hopped
up
saison
hits
the
pallet
nicely
fresh
hops
and
spices
all
across
my
tongue
the
carbonation
takes
away
a
bit
on
the
mouth
feel
for
me
i
guess
i
would
like
a
little
less
but
this
light
bodied
beer
is
a
great
summer
time
treat
this
drinks
easy
especially
due
to
the
great
flavor
and
aromas
d
i
grabbed
a
bottle
in
new
york
for
9
then
i
saw
in
in
ma
for
3
99
that
should
never
happen
as
for
the
beer
it
was
nice
but
even
at
4
these
stone
collaboration
beers
are
a
one
and
done
nice
beer
though
just
not
worth
24
a
six
pack
an
excellent
collaboration
beer
between
all
three
breweries
it
showcases
the
strengths
of
each
brewery
and
i
believe
its
the
first
time
ive
seen
a
dfhstone
collaboration
as
well
both
breweries
are
known
for
pushing
the
limits
of
beer
and
combined
with
victory
certainly
push
the
saison
style
to
something
with
more
character
maybe
my
favorite
collaboration
yet
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
stone
keeps
pushing
boundaries
sometimes
it
works
and
sometimes
its
weird
overall
a
really
unique
belgianstyle
beer
with
saison
being
kind
of
a
catchall
interpretive
style
this
one
stands
apart
from
many
belgian
inspired
beers
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
pair
with
spicy
food
or
a
vegetable
course
d
just
dont
really
like
this
enough
to
call
it
very
drinkable
12oz
bottle
first
of
all
no
way
is
this
a
saison
its
more
like
a
terrible
collaboration
where
each
brewery
took
one
of
their
beers
and
they
just
mixed
them
together
gold
with
a
light
tan
head
nothing
in
appearance
of
note
this
goes
downhill
in
the
aroma
super
herbal
horrendous
spice
almost
smells
like
a
cactus
or
aloe
lotion
taste
sucks
equally
all
oily
sticky
aloe
cactus
might
was
well
cut
open
a
cactus
and
suck
it
feel
is
ok
but
if
you
can
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
sober
youre
quite
a
person
very
drinkable
filling
but
refreshing
d
the
saison
hit
its
mark
imo
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
herbal
flavor
yet
this
would
not
be
something
your
average
saison
would
be
turned
off
by
i
recommend
it
as
it
was
pretty
easy
to
quaff
and
overall
wellbalanced
i
prefer
beer
with
more
body
but
the
light
sparkly
feel
of
saison
du
buff
coupled
with
the
subtle
natural
flavor
make
it
a
refreshing
hot
weather
beer
d
didnt
come
into
this
with
extremely
high
expectations
but
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
love
the
saison
style
in
general
and
the
fairly
unique
herbal
flavors
in
here
add
some
nice
complexity
and
interesting
overall
effect
like
the
cool
feeling
spicy
and
grassy
flavors
glad
i
grabbed
a
few
of
these
bottom
line
with
a
juicy
margaharita
pizza
on
a
hot
summer
day
fantastic
beer
i
think
you
just
have
to
be
in
the
right
moodplace
for
it
though
as
a
standalone
on
any
given
night
definitely
wouldnt
qualify
as
a
goto
props
for
what
they
did
here
though
b
woah
weird
beer
but
i
guess
they
meant
to
create
something
avant
guarde
its
hard
to
rate
because
for
a
saison
it
is
completely
out
of
the
box
interesting
kind
of
awesome
not
what
i
was
expecting
of
course
burnt
gold
with
an
offwhite
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
tons
of
lace
very
pretty
earth
dirt
and
herbs
hit
me
first
in
the
nose
followed
by
lots
of
lemony
grapefruity
orangey
hops
that
are
boosted
by
a
sweet
malt
and
maybe
some
salt
and
pepper
in
the
background
taste
is
bitter
sweet
herb
hop
with
a
bitter
finish
that
sings
with
pepper
and
lemon
basil
like
drinking
a
sweet
hoppy
ipa
in
the
garden
and
a
little
dirt
and
some
of
your
cooking
herbs
got
in
the
glass
wellbalanced
though
and
ti
seems
to
kind
of
work
heres
where
it
gets
tough
to
review
mouthfeel
i
like
my
saisons
much
much
much
more
wellattenuated
i
want
them
dry
and
crisp
it
does
come
off
pretty
dry
in
the
end
but
there
is
sweet
all
over
the
place
in
this
beer
and
the
slickness
of
the
mouthfeel
is
easy
to
misperceive
as
sweetness
or
fullness
and
i
want
the
herbs
and
spices
if
there
are
any
to
be
subtle
and
mysterious
not
muddy
mysterious
think
fantome
the
psrt
do
play
with
the
other
ingredients
in
du
buff
and
they
do
help
to
amplify
the
desirable
flavors
so
this
is
kind
of
cool
they
just
stand
out
a
little
too
much
in
their
own
little
corner
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
full
for
me
and
carbonation
is
too
low
although
i
guess
the
really
old
saisons
were
more
lightly
carbonated
so
who
knows
easy
to
drink
lots
of
fun
food
pairing
options
here
oldschool
saisons
are
in
and
hopped
up
belgian
style
beers
are
cliche
come
on
guys
what
happened
to
being
ahead
of
the
curve
stones
most
complex
offering
to
date
will
be
interesting
to
compare
to
the
same
brew
created
at
dfh
and
victory
d
not
my
favorite
saison
but
a
fun
one
to
try
i
love
the
concept
of
these
collaborations
but
usually
i
find
that
the
sum
of
the
parts
isnt
as
good
as
the
parts
themselves
seems
more
like
a
marketing
and
community
thing
than
about
making
a
great
drinkable
beer
not
something
that
youd
drink
a
few
of
but
more
of
something
that
youd
want
to
just
give
a
shot
to
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
addition
of
all
the
spices
reminds
me
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
saison
however
still
its
good
but
not
really
fitting
the
style
in
my
opinion
yes
it
has
the
spice
but
not
the
funk
or
bigger
fruits
damn
this
is
one
hoppy
beer
it
is
an
excellent
taster
but
i
dont
think
i
could
enjoy
anymore
than
a
couple
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
drinkability
takes
a
hit
because
of
the
at
times
overwhelming
herbal
flavors
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
would
be
paired
nicely
with
a
myriad
of
food
from
spicy
thai
to
fresh
salads
d
easy
to
drink
a
little
spicyhoppy
but
nice
kudos
to
buff
they
have
realized
their
mission
of
freedom
of
flavors
and
made
a
song
into
a
beer
i
would
go
back
to
scarborough
fair
and
would
hope
that
it
was
being
served
on
tap
id
try
it
again
after
some
bottle
aging
which
i
may
have
to
do
once
i
buy
a
second
one
but
i
wouldnt
really
order
this
again
just
because
of
the
very
unbeer
taste
of
it
taste
is
as
good
as
the
nose
very
interesting
the
finish
is
all
spices
really
something
totally
different
and
its
hard
to
explain
but
a
great
job
from
the
guys
at
stone
victory
and
dfh
keep
um
coming
d
the
booziness
isnt
very
strong
hidden
well
behind
the
wall
of
flavor
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
reckless
abandon
of
the
ale
d
because
of
the
extreme
spice
notes
it
has
to
be
drank
a
bit
slow
but
overall
i
am
blown
away
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
too
spicy
also
makes
for
a
not
incredibly
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
sipper
and
ones
enough
for
me
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
great
one
to
pair
with
something
like
lemon
chicken
d
having
a
hard
time
with
this
one
being
in
the
culinary
field
its
hard
for
me
to
not
love
the
flavors
going
on
here
i
am
just
having
a
hard
time
with
the
intensity
of
each
herb
could
see
this
working
well
as
a
soup
base
or
stew
beer
herbs
are
just
a
bit
too
strong
to
make
this
enjoyable
every
sip
dthe
spice
is
insane
in
this
and
lingers
for
quite
some
time
it
is
actually
a
little
weird
and
i
just
dont
think
it
works
for
me
theres
too
much
going
on
in
this
beer
i
dont
like
those
spices
in
beer
it
got
a
little
better
as
it
warmed
up
but
i
still
wouldnt
buy
this
again
carb
and
stuff
was
good
but
i
hate
beers
with
too
much
spices
and
sage
should
never
be
on
food
i
think
im
gonna
go
pop
a
frozen
pizza
into
the
oven
cause
this
really
makes
me
wanna
have
beer
and
pizza
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
pepper
i
get
in
the
aroma
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
here
im
totally
surprised
by
this
one
i
figured
it
was
just
gonna
be
a
novelty
brew
one
and
done
so
overall
its
not
strictly
a
saison
and
its
definitely
not
just
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
its
pretty
enjoyable
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
two
versions
when
they
come
out
i
think
ill
save
a
bottle
and
try
all
3
sidebyside
d
nice
to
have
on
a
hot
day
good
beer
all
around
d
a
cool
take
on
a
style
that
often
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
the
addition
of
the
herbs
was
definitely
a
positive
addition
overall
ive
had
this
a
few
times
now
and
i
keep
finding
myself
coming
back
to
it
a
success
a
great
colabertaion
for
a
very
misunderstood
style
horseblanket
funk
that
rules
try
it
you
will
see
what
i
mean
drinkability
awesome
wish
i
could
get
more
very
clean
and
drinkablewith
enough
hops
ot
mellow
out
the
spices
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
straw
color
with
a
tall
soapy
pure
white
head
that
slowly
settled
into
a
slight
cap
leaving
some
webby
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
with
grassyfloral
hops
light
herbs
pepper
and
a
spot
of
lemon
the
flavor
starts
off
with
the
grassy
hops
fairly
strong
the
herbs
definitely
come
out
in
the
second
wave
though
no
specific
one
really
stands
out
the
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
yeasty
phenols
keep
the
herb
flavor
subtle
there
is
a
strong
pepper
flavor
as
well
the
feel
is
light
but
no
where
near
watery
solid
carbonation
has
a
bitter
edge
but
finishes
sweet
an
odd
saison
very
hoppy
for
the
style
which
probably
masks
some
of
the
other
flavors
good
base
saison
flavor
and
perhaps
the
hops
helps
keep
the
herbs
in
check
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
less
hops
though
it
is
a
nice
profile
and
a
touch
more
yeasty
phenols
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
haze
from
yeast
smells
of
sage
and
rosemary
or
a

great
sage

grapefruit
wheat
perfect
carbonation
and
not
in
your
face
great
version
backyard
farmhouse
brew
id
recommend
it
for
any
stone
or
dogfish
head
fan
drinkabilitys
difficult
the
initial
wow
at
the
complexity
of
this
one
leads
to
some
fatigue
with
the
strong
flavor
profiles
very
enjoyable
but
a
little
goes
a
long
way
id
definitely
try
this
again
but
maybe
recommend
splitting
even
a
12
oz
bottle
this
is
a
beer
that
opens
up
to
new
levels
of
flavour
and
smells
when
it
warms
up
the
nose
is
spices
and
herbs
with
that
sharp
citrus
note
found
in
many
farmhouse
ales
in
the
background
the
beer
takes
a
few
sips
to
orient
itself
until
i
got
a
very
flavourful
saison
with
a
peppery
herbal
note
in
the
dry
finish
well
thought
out
and
very
food
friendly
this
is
a
great
collab
effort
from
3
top
notch
breweries
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
that
its
almost
strictly
a
novelty
it
was
very
nice
to
try
and
ill
get
it
again
but
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
a
treat
beer
that
is
more
of
an
experience
than
it
is
a
traditional
beer
served
up
a
slightly
cloudy
light
amber
with
a
delicate
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
citrusy
it
also
has
that
nice
saison
smell
to
it
that
reminds
me
of
summers
living
on
a
farm
there
are
also
some
complex
herbal
aromas
pepper
and
a
clean
malt
character
the
taste
is
more
complex
than
your
run
of
the
mill
farmhouse
ale
very
herbal
with
plenty
of
peppery
notes
that
are
sharp
and
assertive
this
beer
has
a
firm
bitterness
and
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
the
malt
sweetness
is
there
but
it
is
hard
to
pick
up
on
the
malt
character
with
all
the
spices
and
whatnot
a
tasty
beer
but
perhaps
they
were
a
bit
heavy
handed
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
refreshing
finish
very
drinkable
and
a
good
beer
just
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
very
tasty
the
spices
really
cling
to
the
palate
the
taste
lingered
in
my
mouth
for
quite
some
time
overall
i
have
to
say
i
was
impressed
though
it
does
seem
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
call
this
a
saison
would
it
be
something
i
go
to
a
lot
no
probably
not
i
will
say
it
left
me
with
the
desire
to
have
a
nice
roast
chicken
overall
epic
fail
id
rather
pour
miller
lite
on
a
rag
wipe
my
spice
rack
clean
and
then
drain
it
into
a
glass
and
drink
it
this
one
tasted
awful
if
you
are
seeking
a
truly
great
saison
try
saison
dupont
or
saison
voisen
drinkability
is
very
good
tasty
yet
quenching
light
and
smooth
too
bad
its
a
one
off
thats
overpriced
or
id
enjoy
these
throughout
the
summer
really
dig
the
complex
spiceherb
character
in
this
brew
second
beer
ive
had
with
sage
and
oh
boy
its
a
welcome
addition
especially
for
a
saison
style
hope
one
of
these
breweries
decides
to
put
this
out
at
least
seasonally
sure
itll
go
great
with
grilled
chicken
and
or
a
spring
salad
well
done
single
from
whole
foods
vienna
va
look
forward
to
the
last
two
installments
this
is
a
very
nice
siason
very
flavorful
with
a
nice
nose
while
these
collaborations
are
a
little
pricey
this
one
is
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
poured

mouth
but
i
really
like
this
collaberationit
has
an
american
feel
to
it
with
its
big
citric
flavors
a
nice
saison
beer
even
if
not
true
to
form
drinkability
is
good
tasty
dry
saison
i
like
now
i
just
need
to
save
some
for
thanksgiving
and
drink
it
with
turkey
and
dressing
drinkability
unique
sipping
beer
falvorful
and
gardenlike
dont
let
the
appearance
fool
you
maybe
i
have
terrible
taste
but
i
dont
want
to
feel
like
im
drinking
spaghetti
sauce
in
a
saison
just
not
one
for
me
i
guess
impression
yet
another
fine
american
brew
which
proves
we
can
stand
with
anyone
in
the
world
if
you
like
the
saison
style
this
is
a
must
try
d
due
to
rarity
its
hard
to
drink
a
few
over
all
its
easy
yet
not
for
a
new
craft
drinker
medium
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
saison
at
4
a
bottle
not
terribly
priced
as
i
suppose
all
that
travel
for
this
collabo
cost
some
money
d
quite
a
bitter
little
saison
here
with
a
strong
herbal
hop
bite
i
especially
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
collaboration
brew
pours
clear
golden
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
strong
with
musky
lemon
pine
resin
and
rosemary
the
flavor
is
lemony
with
rosemary
rose
pine
mint
lavender
vanilla
with
a
pleasant
piny
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
head
smelled
of
many
herbs
but
rosemary
stood
out
for
me
same
with
the
taste
very
complex
and
varied
with
the
differetn
herbs
each
sip
can
almost
taste
a
little
different
depending
on
which
herb
your
tongue
picks
up
i
found
it
more
interesting
with
each
sip
mouthfeel
was
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
perhaps
one
would
tire
of
this
after
one
or
two
so
a
markdown
for
that
d
i
found
this
beer
very
complex
and
interesting
but
at
the
same
time
something
i
likely
wont
get
again
its
not
bad
but
the
herbal
notes
are
just
a
little
too
strong
for
my
liking
and
the
finish
leaves
something
to
be
desired
drinkability
was
also
very
much
above
average
im
picking
up
a
few
of
these
for
an
upcoming
tasting
since
the
nose
is
so
appealing
will
buy
again
not
the
best
tasting
saison
ive
ever
had
but
very
complex
and
well
crafted
pours
a
hazy
yellow
straw
color
with
active
carbonation
but
little
head
and
lacing
first
scent
brings
medicinal
herbs
and
lemon
almost
like
a
cough
drop
some
pepper
and
yeast
on
the
rear
end
taste
brings
more
of
the
medicinal
herb
notes
backed
with
a
more
pronounced
lemon
yeast
and
pepper
notes
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
taste
decent
to
try
but
not
my
bag
of
chips
d
a
pretty
unique
brew
that
turned
out
very
nicely
the
herbal
flavors
taste
really
fresh
and
add
a
nice
touch
to
a
solid
base
i
hope
i
can
get
my
hands
on
another
one
or
two
of
these
before
its
gone
d
the
beer
is
relatively
drinkable
but
only
if
you
are
accustomed
to
lots
of
herbal
flavors
such
as
those
found
in
gruit
beers
strong
aroma
of
hoppy
lemon
herbal
taste
up
front
followed
by
fruity
hops
parsley
and
a
bit
of
soapiness
moderatetohigh
carbonation
and
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
couldnt
quite
get
over
the
overall
flavor
which
was
an
odd
combination
of
a
very
nice
ipa
and
lemony
dish
soap
glad
i
tried
it
but
one
was
plenty
superb

this

can

out
there
interesting
possibilities
well
my
notes
say
basil
tasting
strong
basil
taste
but
after
talking
with
greg
from
stone
he
said
its
parsley
rosemary
sage
and
thyme
sounds
great
if
im
making
sausage
but
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
wasnt
offensive
but
i
doubt
ill
go
there
again
finishing
was
rather
bitter
and
it
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
too
bad
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
these
herbs
really
belong
in
a
beer
at
least
not
this
one
i
wish
it
were
bottle
conditioned
as
well
i
dont
think
it
is
because
this
wiould
lend
a
bit
more
authentic
saison
taste
depending
on
the
yeast
used
flavor
is
very
interesting
its
good
but
not
great
a
little
too
much
going
on
for
my
liking
good
complexity
but
spicesgalore
theres
a
hoppiness
that
comes
on
strong
on
the
back
side
of
the
flavor
followed
by
a
dry
pale
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
carbonated
booze
is
low
a
decent
saison
d
good
drinkability
loved
this
beer
depsite
the
low
rankings
so
far
its
not
on
style
but
its
a
great
change
of
pace
i
think
we
should
rate
this
beer
for
the
enjoyment
instead
of
saying
its
not
a
saison
deep
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
of
white
head
brewed
with
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
the
spice
bill
couldnt
come
through
in
a
more
clear
and
obvious
way
personally
i
like
the
nose
a
lot
the
taste
is
a
little
weaker
but
still
clean
and
packed
with
earthy
spice
rack
lighter
bodied
crisp
and
dry
theres
nothing
misleading
about
the
label
of
this
beer
so
if
you
like
the
way
the
despription
sounds
youll
probably
like
the
way
the
beer
tastes
well
done
fun
to
share
i
love
saisons
i
like
the
concept
i
like
the
freshness
and
spiciness
but
the
herbs
are
a
little
too
overpowering
for
me
tone
down
the
sage
and
rosemary
flavors
and
boost
the
funky
yeasty
component
that
is
so
essential
to
saisons
and
i
think
this
beer
would
be
more
successful
starts
off
drinking
nicely
but
when
the
novelty
wears
off
its
a
tad
boring
still
good
but
nothing
changes
at
is
warms
not
sure
what
food
would
do
well
against
this
powerful
i
am
blown
away
with
the
complexity
and
yet
refreshing
drinkability
of
this
beer
all
i
can
say
is
more
more
more
i
raise
my
glass
high
to
this
holy
trinity
of
brewing
cheers
d
i
was
kind
of
hoping
for
a
little
more
of
the
traditional
saison
fruitiness
but
with
the
herbs
listed
on
the
bottle
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
maybe
traditional
wasnt
what
they
were
going
for
just
a
hunch
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
slainte
i
hope
drinkability
wow
very
unique
herbs
aplenty
this
beer
probably
sat
in
my
fridge
for
two
weeks
because
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
made
a
solid
decision
buying
it
however
its
pretty
good
crisp
very
refreshing
cant
see
wanting
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
has
broadened
my
definition
on
what
works
for
beer
additional
plus
fresh
breath
so
there
you
go
o
the
herbs
and
the
hops
play
really
well
with
each
other
definitely
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
tried
and
very
inventive
on
the
brewers
parts
herbal
and
hoppy
with
a
tinge
of
herbs
lots
of
nose
and
sweet
body
i
can
only
suggest
more
on
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
d
drinkable
strong
in
the
herby
flavor
one
will
do
ya
i
love
the
experimentation
this
is
worth
seeking
out
if
only
to
try
something
completely
unusual
overall
interesting
to
try
but
the
spices
kind
of
killed
it
experimenting
is
fun
but
doesnt
always
work
the
beer
pours
into
my
duvel
tulip
a
brilliant
gold
color
a
lovely
white
head
forms
2
53
fingers
worth
theres
some
lacing
but
not
quite
enough
to
earn
a
5
the
nose
is
decent
but
fairly
straightforward
as
the
sage
and
rosemary
are
pretty
much
all
that
come
through
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
thankfully
as
the
other
spices
begin
to
come
through
and
theres
some
traditional
clovepepper
notes
that
id
expect
in
a
saison
theres
a
little
bit
more
bitterness
than
i
usually
encounter
in
a
saison
but
this
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
body
is
nice
and
dry
and
the
aforementioned
bitterness
is
crisp
theres
a
nice
high
level
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
the
spice
presence
stops
just
short
of
being
overbearing
im
going
to
have
to
track
a
few
more
bottles
down
as
this
was
outrageous
with
a
simple
dish
of
pasta
with
garlic
and
oil
this
beer
is
wildly
herbal
and
spicy
it
is
very
out
of
the
ordinary
and
crazy
but
if
it
werent
then
these
guys
wouldnt
be
doing
their
job
extremely
unique
saison
the
herbs
are
very
present
and
pleasant
and
blend
together
great
to
make
a
very
enjoyablerefreshing
saison
overall
this
is
a
unique
interesting
tasting
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
many
of
them
the
abv
is
reasonable
but
the
herbal
taste
can
be
a
little
overpowering
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
wish
that
i
could
try
the
versions
from
each
of
the
other
breweries
d
very
good
brew
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
feel
of
this
beer
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
some
nice
smooth
feel
makes
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
offering
and
a
really
great
collaboration
beer
one
of
my
favs
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
my
favorite
of
the
stone
colabs
just
very
herbal
its
a
very
creative
attempt
but
not
something
id
pay
for
again
overall
the
beer
is
missing
the
complexity
that
i
expect
out
of
a
saison
it
is
even
more
disappointing
when
the
nose
seemed
to
suggest
such
a
wonderful
bouquet
d
after
awhile
the
seasonings
did
become
a
bit
overbearing
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
my
first
three
brewers
collaboration
beer
didnt
have
my
beer
journal
handy
so
this
wont
be
a
fullscale
review
i
love
the
style
and
this
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
take
on
a
saison
that
ive
come
across
the
nose
and
taste
were
most
similar
to
moonlights
artemis
artemis
was
a
hopless
beer
whereas
this
was
not
however
the
extreme
floral
and
earthy
taste
which
dominated
moonlight
was
just
right
in
du
buff
that
being
said
i
will
always
support
stone
and
its
their
choice
to
keep
brewing
whatever
the
hell
they
want
ill
probably
buy
it
anyway
the
body
was
average
for
the
style
light
and
crisp
drinkability
was
a
little
on
the
hard
side
i
wouldnt
have
a
second
12oz
bottle
in
a
row
and
i
suspect
that
a
pint
would
be
hard
to
get
through
overall
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
but
its
probably
worth
a
shot
drinkability
as
i
said
before
theres
a
fair
bit
to
enjoy
in
this
beer
however
the
overall
experience
is
a
bit
rough
drinkable
but
really
sessionable
poured
into
my
la
fin
du
monde
chalice
beautiful
slightly
hazed
bright
sunshine
golden
hue
with
a
bright
34
finger
stretch
of
head
lacing
is
fine
and
evenly
scattered
between
sips
nice
stuff
aroma
has
a
bright
herbal
garden
nose
the
rosemary
additiones
stand
out
but
i
dont
think
i
could
pick
out
the
others
individually
very
pleasant
theres
also
a
pleasant
lemonlime
tone
to
the
nos
flavor
is
harsh
with
herbal
spices
the
underlyng
saison
is
hard
to
determine
because
the
untraditional
brewing
additions
create
a
blanket
of
bitterness
im
guessing
the
thyme
did
this
it
overpowers
chicken
when
fresh
and
overused
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
not
boozey
just
a
cast
of
bittering
herbs
sticks
to
the
palate
like
toms
organic
toothpaste
drinkability
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
herbal
saisons
dont
work
to
well
checkout
reviews
from
great
lakes
version
last
spring
the
only
place
this
beer
is
not
scoring
well
would
be
drinkability
its
more
of
a
novelty
beer
and
not
something
i
would
have
often
that
being
said
its
still
a
tasty
brew
and
worth
a
try
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
pretty
good
and
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
herbs
citrus
grapefruit
lemon
peel
and
peppery
spice
the
herbal
flavors
in
this
brew
overpower
the
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
flavors
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
in
this
case
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
the
mix
of
herbs
used
in
it
work
great
ive
had
mixed
experiences
with
beers
brewed
with
herbs
but
luckily
this
one
turned
out
good
it
seems
like
these
collaborations
are
the
only
stone
beers
i
buy
anymore
and
maybe
there
is
a
reason
for
that
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
yeasty
smell
to
it
like
a
saison
should
i
like
dteh
flavor
even
if
it
was
very
heavy
on
the
thyme
it
almost
seemed
like
it
had
some
hops
going
on
but
that
may
have
been
the
herbs
overall
a
good
saison
after
the
outtatheballpark
aroma
i
was
let
down
by
the
flavor
not
terrible
but
doesnt
live
up
to
its
promise
interesting
but
what
the
heck
this
is
pretty
off
the
wall
seems
that
they
were
stretching
to
figure
out
what
to
do
here
you
know
these
guys
can
do
better
sometimes
it
is
best
to
stick
to
what
you
already
do
well
all
these
spices
on
the
label
had
me
worried
but
the
flavors
have
been
blended
to
near
perfection
a
must
try
for
saison
heads
like
me
overall
a
solid
beer
and
the
sort
of
thing
to
excite
lovers
of
the
extreme
for
me
however
it
looses
a
couple
of
point
for
being
just
a
bit
to
much
across
the
herbs
if
i
werent
told
this
was
a
saison
i
probably
never
would
have
guessed
it
myself
i
could
see
making
a
delicious
lamb
stew
out
of
this
ale
drinkability
one
of
the
rare
beers
in
my
opinion
that
tastes
nothing
like
the
nose
the
nose
came
across
as
amazing
but
the
taste
itself
is
extremely
off
putting
i
have
one
more
left
and
will
probably
give
it
as
an
extra
to
someone
i
dont
like
heh
another
beer
that
is
more
interesting
than
good
i
think
this
beer
had
a
chance
until
they
bombarded
with
herbs
the
nose
is
fantastic
however
unfortunately
it
does
not
translate
well
i
love
the
smell
of
a
juicy
steak
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
one
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
color
and
formed
a
foamy
snow
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
hops
malt
biscuits
citrus
and
pepper
the
flavor
was
of
hops
pepper
and
flowers
the
body
is
medium
light
and
the
the
finish
slightly
bitter
d
im
not
big
into
the
whole
spice
thing
in
beer
usually
but
it
works
quite
nicely
for
this
beer
dflavorful
and
refreshing
big
flavor
different
herbs
come
through
on
the
end
of
the
palate
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
herbs
come
through
quite
nicely
and
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
another
winner
in
the
stone
collaboration
series
if
you
like
your
herbs
then
i
highly
recommend
you
seek
this
out
or
if
youre
looking
for
a
change
from
the
regular
saison
style
nice
job
buff
city
beer
store
light
golden
beer
with
a
big
puffy
white
head
lots
of
big
bubbles
the
aroma
is
hugely
herbal
it
reminded
me
of
a
savory
dish
sage
and
rosemary
are
easier
to
pick
out
but
its
all
a
pleasant
muddle
of
savory
herbs
the
herbs
make
the
malt
aroma
seem
fresh
and
delicious
the
flavor
didnt
work
as
well
for
me
it
seemed
oddly
bland
for
a
saison
much
less
a
saison
full
of
herbs
medium
sweet
not
much
in
the
flavor
really
sets
this
beer
out
as
a
saison
and
it
doesnt
compare
favorably
to
the
heavy
hitters
from
belgium
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
the
beer
is
good
but
offstyle
and
in
my
opinion
it
would
have
been
better
with
more
saison
character
im
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
other
collaborations
that
stone
has
coming
up
pours
a
dark
goldenapricot
color
with
a
big
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
rosemary
grapefruit
and
lemon
pretty
floral
and
herb
forward
on
the
palate
with
a
little
honey
coming
in
on
the
finish
another
pretty
decent
stone
collaboration
brew
but
again
nothing
earth
shattering
and
not
worth
the
4
price
tag
i
found
this
one
really
pleasant
probably
best
in
smaller
doses
it
would
be
really
nice
paired
with
a
salad
of
stronger
flavored
greens
like
arugula
and
radicchio
dont
expect
to
get
something
balanced
as
the
herbs
really
take
over
so
if
you
dont
enjoy
fresh
herbs
dont
bother
i
however
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
overall
an
interesting
saison
i
enjoyed
the
herbs
but
i
felt
that
they
could
be
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
i
had
it
with
a
bbq
chicken
dinner
and
i
though
it
went
well
but
i
am
glad
a
split
a
glass
because
i
feel
this
beer
may
be
a
bit
unbalanced
an
interesting
and
good
saison
interpretation
from
stone
dfh
and
victory
d
very
nice
to
style
for
the
teamwork
of
3
small
american
breweries
there
is
a
certain
acidity
that
lasts
through
the
flavor
and
body
of
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
if
its
hop
or
yeast
born
maybe
both
this
could
probably
keep
me
from
more
than
one
but
i
can
see
this
being
delicious
on
a
very
hot
day
the
intense
herbal
flavor
is
something
better
kept
in
the
realm
of
solid
food
it
tasted
a
little
too
much
like
sipping
on
roasted
chicken
broth
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
too
long
but
not
in
a
harsh
way
but
rather
in
a
past
your
welcome
kind
of
way
nice
idea
but
better
kept
on
the
drawing
board
beer
pours
golden
straw
color
herby
notes
followed
by
hoppy
notes
pairs
well
with
the
roasted
shrimp
pho
i
brought
home
with
the
beer
leaves
a
faint
lace
on
the
glass
i
think
this
collaboration
is
a
winner
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
keep
up
the
good
work
fellas
you
know
im
going
to
go
with
really
really
good
this
is
what
brewing
in
america
is
about
reinventing
styles
experimenting
screwing
around
but
still
coming
up
with
something
refreshing
tasty
and
drinkable
and
something
unique
unexpected
and
fascinating
worst
stone
beer
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
a
novelty
beer
and
here
is
why
lack
of
balance
the
herbs
and
spices
are
waaayyyy
too
overpowering
to
the
point
where
the
usual
elements
that
make
a
good
saison
are
barely
present
however
its
still
tasty
it
could
just
use
a
little
more
refinement
i
dont
get
excited
about
collaboration
beers
and
this
is
the
perfect
reminder
for
me
no
more
plunking
down
my
money
for
a
bunch
of
brewers
to
get
together
and
circle
jerk
pours
straw
gold
mild
cloudiness
moderate
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
has
a
large
amount
of
herbs
to
it
obviously
in
large
part
to
the
herb
additions
though
it
melds
nicely
together
with
a
light
farmhouse
funk
and
citric
hop
character
the
sage
thyme
and
rosemary
all
have
a
good
presence
but
it
all
comes
together
fairly
indistinctly
the
flavor
starts
off
with
a
large
amount
of
geranium
notes
with
grapefruit
acidity
and
mild
farmhouse
funk
and
thyme
light
sage
sharp
herbal
bitterness
in
the
middle
and
end
dry
finish
with
mild
farmhouse
not
sure
if
the
herbs
are
bringing
the
bitterness
up
here
or
what
but
it
is
a
bit
astringent
on
the
finish
overly
dry
and
really
reduces
the
refreshmentdrinkability
factor
light
to
medium
bodied
with
forceful
carbonation
the
smell
probably
pleases
me
most
here
i
want
to
like
it
more
than
i
do
the
finish
really
brings
down
the
drinkability
for
me
fantastic
collaboration
i
bought
a
few
bottles
at
stone
and
will
give
it
another
try
later
to
see
if
my
opinion
changes
a
completely
unique
beer
even
amongst
some
of
the
more
experimental
american
takes
on
the
saison
style
it
couldve
gone
totally
out
of
whack
considering
each
of
these
herbs
is
assertive
on
its
own
much
less
thrown
into
a
beer
together
but
when
you
take
into
account
whos
in
charge
im
not
surprised
at
its
balance
worth
trying
at
least
once
even
at
the
high
price
these
stone
collaborations
are
usually
set
at
d
this
is
really
good
stuff
its
extremely
herbal
but
i
like
that
so
it
worked
nicely
for
me
begs
to
be
with
food
im
excited
to
hold
on
to
my
other
bottle
for
a
few
months
and
see
what
happens
to
it
going
to
pick
up
some
bottle
and
let
these
bad
boys
age
some
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
into
a
tulip
glass
small
head
with
a
decent
carbonation
big
smell
of
mints
and
herbs
hits
the
nose
almost
herblike
all
though
i
think
that
might
have
been
the
only
herb
not
used
in
this
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
feeling
with
light
zesty
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
slightly
tart
bitterness
that
washes
down
and
leaves
a
grainyearthy
sweetness
its
not
the
boldest
or
the
funkiest
but
its
very
good
a
nice
version
of
this
style
and
one
i
would
definitely
have
again
fruity
medium
to
thick
body
earthy
to
funky
banana
pears
and
apricot
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
saison
hint
of
pepper
but
amazing
saison
top
5
for
your
palette
in
this
catagory
for
sure
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
smells
of
lemon
and
some
sour
grain
taste
begins
with
a
tart
citrus
then
a
mild
grain
and
finishing
with
an
herbal
phenolic
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
a
bit
funkier
than
i
prefer
though
very
earthy
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
farmhouse
ale
did
not
care
for
this
beer
at
all
mild
flavor
little
tartness
almost
citrusy
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
love
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
mot
than
a
little
offputting
really
mediocre
not
very
carbonated
flavor
is
off
though
more
bleh
than
really
bad
none
of
the
spicy
or
fruity
flavor
you
want
just
some
slightly
weird
yeast
delicious
nice
alcohol
content
and
flavour
it
has
a
really
interesting
color
to
it
really
thick
for
a
farmhouse
ale
the
smell
was
a
bit
off
putting
almost
a
sour
but
the
taste
is
fantastic
in
combination
and
theres
a
very
fine
citrus
coating
on
the
tongue
afterwards
which
is
not
unpleasant
its
alright
smooth
with
a
light
taste
good
color
and
smell
overall
a
good
beer
pours
pale
hazy
straw
with
hints
of
pink
grapefruit
small
head
that
fades
quick
mild
yet
pleasant
aroma
of
bananas
and
clove
surrounded
by
strong
wheatiness
flavor
has
strong
yeast
presence
with
more
banana
and
spices
moderate
carbonation
that
fades
pretty
quick
an
enjoyable
saison
that
would
probably
be
even
better
with
a
slightly
higher
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
brewer
doesnt
let
me
down
here
suitably
complex
and
developing
as
it
comes
to
cask
temperature
must
try
its
got
a
nice
spice
to
it
that
isnt
overpowering
and
lights
up
the
flavor
buds
on
my
tongue
excellent
beer
i
wrote
this
threesheets
to
the
wind
but
stand
by
it
wholeheartedly
mouthfeel
is
sweet
at
first
then
drying
and
crisp
o
not
a
bad
saison
would
drink
again
taste
exactly
like
a
cask
summer
in
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
very
good
rendition
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
i
recommend
drinking
colette
while
eating
bratwurst
with
sauerkraut
the
problem
about
this
beer
review
is
me
i
personally
think
saisons
taste
like
rusty
rebar
dipped
in
a
batter
of
yeast
good
buzz
for
only
7
3
abv
came
across
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
fizzy
and
enjoyable
cloudy
light
gold
pour
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
has
light
notes
of
yeast
grain
and
clove
taste
has
funk
lemon
yeast
and
banana
upfront
backed
by
a
a
nice
clove
flavor
can
also
taste
some
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
finishes
with
tastes
of
lemon
and
light
clove
lingering
for
a
bit
had
this
on
tap
in
12oz
snifter
smell
is
sweet
fruity
and
dry
first
thing
i
notice
with
the
taste
is
belgian
yeast
twang
that
of
what
youd
get
in
a
belgian
tripel
the
yeast
calms
down
as
it
warms
up
and
develops
a
nice
spicepepper
flavor
which
pairs
nicely
with
the
citruspineapplebright
fruit
flavors
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
saison
with
the
refreshing
fruity
characteristics
that
is
making
me
start
to
enjoy
the
style
alot
more
the
funky
yeast
can
be
the
hardest
part
of
enjoying
this
style
but
the
yeast
here
mellows
out
nicely
so
i
d
definitely
recommend
this
to
people
who
are
on
the
fence
for
the
style
89100
florida
saison
is
a
pretty
open
style
but
i
generally
expect
more
phenols
as
well
as
more
hops
all
the
best
examples
have
that
overall
i
just
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
and
im
glad
its
a
fine
brew
but
i
wouldnt
want
this
very
often
o
if
it
were
a
bit
less
heftyfeeling
this
would
easily
be
right
there
with
dupont
as
it
stands
its
still
a
very
good
saison
one
that
ranks
very
highly
among
the
murican
examples
in
fact
plus
its
in
six
packs
a
rocksolid
saison
in
six
packs
damn
right
ill
be
all
over
it
o
i
like
the
lightness
in
everything
about
this
beer
nothing
is
overpowering
which
presumably
makes
it
a
well
balanced
beer
i
will
definitely
grab
this
for
a
change
of
pace
but
it
wont
be
in
the
regular
rotation
o
great
beer
would
buy
again
this
lighter
style
of
saison
is
more
to
my
liking
and
will
look
for
it
again
bottle
bought
from
chucks

thin
white
head
that
fades
immediately
smells
of
biscuit
malt
sweet
earthy
with
a
hint
of
spice
tastes
bready
with
a
dry
spicy
finish
good
example
of
a
saison
but
there
is
a
flavor
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
which
sticks
out
and
makes
it
less
tasty
than
others
id
like
more
hop
character
on
the
finish
overall
pretty
awesome
saison
its
been
awhile
but
ill
enjoy
more
in
the
near
future
overall
excellent
example
of
a
good
saison
o
i
am
a
big
fan
i
love
farmhouse
ales
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
a
stellar
beer
in
my
opinion
great
divides
take
on
the
farmhouse
ale
is
not
disappointing
it
has
strong
hints
of
fruit
especially
citrus
on
the
initall
taste
i
was
very
impressed
great
feel
on
the
mouth
and
not
too
hoppy
i
would
rate
this
higher
but
for
me
it
got
a
little
bitter
on
my
last
few
sips
still
a
very
good
brew
though
o
ive
only
recently
started
my
journey
into
saisons
and
this
one
definitely
helped
guarantee
i
would
keep
going
i
loved
the
contrasting
effects
of
spicy
sweet
earthy
hop
and
sour
in
this
one
the
flavors
morphed
and
mixed
wonderfully
from
beginning
to
end
o
i
love
the
aroma
so
subtle
and
inviting
the
flavor
profile
is
very
complex
but
everything
is
distinct
and
works
together
and
each
note
is
distinguishable
and
complements
the
others
this
is
a
flavor
symphony
the
beer
drinks
easily
this
american
incarceration
of
a
classic
belgian
style
rivals
the
best
belgians
and
outshines
many
this
is
truly
an
awesome
beer
overall
just
an
excellent
easily
drinkable
refreshing
and
delicious
farmhouse
ale
overall
a
nice
saison
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
i
could
see
myself
putting
away
quite
a
few
of
these
during
a
bbq
if
great
divide
were
to
get
distribution
in
sacramento
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
looks
pretty
good
though
more
head
would
be
nice
scents
of
banana
honey
earthy
yeast
wheat
citrus
peel
mango
pineapple
and
floral
hops
a
rich
bright
fruity
aroma
with

yeasty
character
as
well
quite
nice
flavor
begins
nicely
sweet
with
spicy
funky
belgian
yeast
moving
into
a
more
sour
funk
with
notes
of
citrus
pineapple
honey
and
wheat
malt
the
finish
is
spicy
with
notes
of
coriander
and
some
floral
notes
aftertaste
is
floral
and
spicy
with
coriander
notes
a
very
good
relatively
complex

very
much
a
belgian
and
a
solid
example
of
a

very
well
executed
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
prickly
carbonation
and
a
semidrying
feel
very
good
and
true
to
form
for
a
saison
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
great
divide
managed
to
make
a
saison
with
a
good
deal
of
complexity
a
nice
flavor
and
aroma
profile
and
good
mouthfeel
a
truly
excellent
beer
overall
a
brew
with
outstanding
character
and
at
a
fairly
good
price
final
thought
7
and
only
2
a
bottle
just
try
it
its
finally
spring
so
it
was
time
to
get
the
first
saison
of
the
year
this
is
a
bit
strong
but
also
very
good
at
7
3
abv
its
not
something
ill
adopt
as
my
summer
beer
of
choice
but
was
a
good
call
to
have
with
dinner
very
happy
with
the
beer
but
its
certainly
as
great
divide
says
their
interpretation
of
the
style
rather
than
an
authentic
one
overall
this
is
a
wellexecuted
higher
abv
saison
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
but
not
really
enough
to
wow
you
overall
a
nice
farmhouse
ale
but
the
astringency
knocks
it
out
of
balance
could
use
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
rather
than
just
bitter
still
pretty
refreshing
and
quaffable
i
will
not
have
trouble
drinking
this
six
pack
and
would
gladly
accept
another
would
even
order
a
pint
when
at
the
brewery
o
a
solid
ale
with
good
qualities
an
easy
drinker
that
satisfies
and
refreshes
not
as
strong
as
great
divides
yeti
series
but
still
enjoyable
poured
from

into

very
light
amberorangy
color
with
almost
no

nice
stonefruit
aroma
peach
with
a
little
yeasty
funk
taste
is
very
similar
but
with
added
citrus
and
nice
tartness
and
juicy
mouthfeel
all
around
good
beer
would
recommend
awesome
that
my
100th
beer
is
a
farmhouse
ale
and
one
that
tastes
almost
identical
to
the
farmhouse
ale
at
carters
in
billings
mt
which
was
the
first
beer
style
i
found
myself
getting
into
early
in
my
beer
career
in
case
youve
never
had
a
good
farmhouse
it
tastes
sort
of
sweetly
tart
mild
in
body
and
flavor
but
oh
so
refreshing
pairs
great
with
meals
since
it
wont
overpower
much
but
still
strong
enough
to
stand
alone
smell
is
wonderful
too
intoxicating
cheers
stable
saison
flavor
is
spoton
to

peppery

pith
wheaty

some

perhaps
white

a
bit
huffy
in
carbonation
body
feels
right
if
not
close
to
average
lacks
complexity
but
delivers
as
a
solid
craft
saison
would
drink
again
but
not
seek
it
out
to
do
so
let
it
land
on
my
lap
this
beer
was
a
terrific
surprise
it
has
a
body
that
is
so
much
more
than
you
were
expecting
but
doesnt
give
way
to
syrup
or
to
heaviness
its
terribly
sweet
but
has
a
lightness
that
seems
puzzling
as
it
warms
the
spice
comes
to
the
nose
and
really
makes
this
complex
overall
not
impressed
maybe
it
would
be
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
complexity
it
has
takes
it
away
from
style
and
into
a
unwelcomed
direction
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
the
beer
is
hazy
and
straw
to
golden
hued
with
a
quarter
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
offers
malt
grass
light
spice
coriander
pepper
medium
bodied
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
harsh
aggressive
hop
punch
toward
the
finish
pepper
and
alcohol
citrus
lemon
a
bit
unrefined
not
bad
but
lacking
the
elegant
complexity
andor
drinkability
i
was
seeking
o
a
really
nice
interpretation
of
the
farmhouse
style
not
bad
the
dirty
coriander
note
whether
from
the
fermentation
character
or
actual
coriander
is
a
touch
too
much
i
do
like
the
texture
that
this
beer
has
it
is
nice
without
being
too
heavy
i
compare
all
farmhouse
ales
to
oxbows
farmhouse
pale
criticize
my
benchmark
all
you
want
but
its
a
near
perfect
beer
the
colette
is
nearly
as
good
im
very
happy
with
the
aroma
and
taste
it
represents
the
style
quite
well
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
definitely
will
buy
again
this
is
an
awesome
interpretation
of
a
farmhouse
ale
very
bold
and
flavorful
while
being
drinkable
and
refreshing
worth
a
try

this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
perfectly
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
o
great
beer
and
would
drink
again
overall
a
tiny
bit
sweeter
than
i
like
from
a
saison
but
a
very
nice
blend
of
complex
tropical
fruit
flavors
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
due
to
the
sweetness
but
overall
an
excellent
beer
have
to
get
back
into
great
divide
it
has
been
a
while
bottle
appearance
hazy
straw
with
a
quickly
disappearing
white
foamy
head
aroma
yeast
sulfur
taste
lively
mouthfeel
thin
body
starts
a
bit
start
but
finish
and
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
fruit
palate
the
fruity
finish
is
really
unique
starts
like
a
pretty
standard
saison
but
the
finish
is
a
real
kicker
overall
overall
a
saison
that
leans
towards
more
savoury
then
sweet
notes
still
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
a
good
saison
from
a
great
brewer
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
andor
brewery
o
a
great
widely
available
saison
very
clean
and
fresh
very
drinkable
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
ale
quite
a
bit
its
a
wonderfully
refreshing
summer
brew
that
is
light
and
doesnt
weigh
heavy
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
good
beer
but
really
not
a
great
saison
its
too
sweet
and
lacks
the
refreshing
crisp
dryness
that
is
a
major
draw
of
saisons
this
is
kind
of
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
blended
with
a
tripel
with
some
hints
of
a
saison
appearance
pile
yellow
with
a
white
head
smell
wheat
belgin
yeast
and
a
little
citrus
taste
pineapple
citrus
and
a
nice
saison
funk
mouthfeel
medium
body
carbonation
is
very
nice
overall
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
sunny
day
overalltastes
like
a
summer
day
hooray
summer
this
is
one
beer
in
which
it
can
be
argued
whether
the
use
of
rice
benefits
the
mouthfeel
or
not
it
does
make
it
smoother
but
this
is
a
style
in
which
i
hope
for
a
crisper
bite
there
is
crispness
but
the
smoothness
seems
to
be
the
main
focus
in
the
addition
of
rice
the
body
is
fluffy
and
rests
right
on
the
light
edge
of
medium
a
pretty
good
saison
that
ill
definitely
to
have
to
track
down
when
its
available
o
bitterness
from
the
wheat
and
tartness
from
the
yeast
and
acid
blend
well
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
o
colette
is
an
outstanding
american
version
of
farmhouse
ale
clean
grain
and
bread
maltiness
with
fruity
yeast
esters
finished
with
lemon
citrus
and
the
righ
punch
of
dryness
yet
another
reason
i
am
sad
that
gd
is
no
longer
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
in
va
enjoy
it
with
some
spicy
mexican
food
overall
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
saison
style
good
use
of
spices
and
yeast
on
the
tarter
side
but
good
overall
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
great
divide
and
this
one
continues
the
trend
if
you
like
saisons
this
is
worth
a
try
o
the
aroma
was
a
bit
strange
and
unappealing
the
flavor
was
enjoyable
fruity
and
slightly
tart
good
light
summertime
beer
but
not
a
great
saison
o
sweet
candy
sugar
is
a
nice
finish
but
becomes
a
little
too
sweet
by
the
end
of
the
drink
decent
solid
farmhousebelgian
hybrid
profile
a
bit
sweet
overall
but
the
finish
is
on
point
overall
this
one
is
one
great
beer
a
definite
must
try
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
stocked
in
my
fridge
a
super
complex
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
on
any
summer
evening
overall
pretty
psyched
to
have
this
one
again
this
is
a
real
nice
one
from
great
divide
overall
3
55
colette
is
an
okay
saison
but
there
seems
to
be
something
missing
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
sixer
but
what
really
is
lacking
here
is
carbonation
i
feel
that
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
mess
with
what
could
be
a
much
better
drinking
beer
than
the
one
i
am
currently
holding
o
good
good
good
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
id
likeprefer
the
abv
to
be
a
bit
lower
oa
pretty
good
saison
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
represents
a
saison
pretty
well
o
a
nice
saison
with
very
clean
flavors
just
wish
it
was
a
little
drier
and
less
boozy
o
about
what
i
expect
out
of
a
sixpack
saison
tasty
and
refreshing
but
nothing
real
special
would
be
great
for
someone
who
enjoys
a
lighter
saison
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
if
youre
going
to
try
one
this
would
be
a
good
choice
i
am
surprised
and
excited
that
this
is
a
6pack
another
job
well
done
by
gdbc
overall
one
of
the
better
farmhouses
ive
had
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
mainly
because
of
the
overwhelming
spices
but
this
one
is
sufficiently
complex
with
other
flavors
to
distract
me
give
it
a
try
it
could
be
a
good
introduction
to
a
style
that
may
not
be
your
favorite
o
its
a
great
beer
refreshing
light
citrus
and
spice
fresh
wheat
takes
me
to
a
summer
bbq
with
bright
blue
skies
cool
breeze
and
wheat
fields
lovely
fresh
light
kitchen
gingham
red
and
white
summer
breeze
swinging
on
a
tire
swing
great
feeling
very
pleased
with
this
beer
it
pours
a
very
beautiful
very
hazy
gold
with
a
white
head
head
retention
is
poor
but
the
lacing
is
nice
while
it
lasts
enticing
aromas
of
citrus
zest
and
ginger
entice
the
nose
with
hints
of
grass
and
a
strong
underying
yeastiness
the
taste
is
very
yeasty
with
some
spiciness
a
slight
sour
funk
follows
the
taste
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
the
finish
has
a
lot
of
lemon
zest
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
had
expected
and
it
dries
the
mouth
out
a
bit
the
carbonation
however
is
perfect
not
too
much
or
too
little
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
o
good
surprise
as
i
typically
dont
care
for
the
style
this
is
bright
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
without
a
ton
of
crazy
overpowering
yeastiness
notes
very
drinkable
good
to
enjoy
anytime
of
year
and
the
dry
finish
is
very
better
cheers
could
use
a
bit
better
mouthfeel
but
overly
a
very
accesible
saison
overall
a
very
drinkable
farmhouse
ale
id
especially
recommend
this
as
a
first
foray
into
the
style
for
someone
who
maybe
isnt
certain
about
it
there
are
others
i
would
drink
first
but
i
like
a
bit
more
funk
and
a
touch
of
hopbitterness
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
one
for
an
outdoor
summer
setting
o
6er
recommended
overall
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
by
this
beer
when
i
first
purchased
the
six
pack
back
in
may
or
so
but
a
second
take
has
convinced
me
this
beer
is
worth
revisiting
its
mellowed
out
significantly
and
the
aggressive
funkyesterydusty
aromas
and
flavors
i
remember
have
taken
on
a
subtler
and
more
balanced
feel
nice
worth
trying
either
way
but
id
recommend
giving
it
six
months
or
so
this
is
really
nice
the
blending
is
outstanding
ive
had
some
that
are
fruitier
and
i
like
those
too
but
this
one
shines
for
its
complexity
and
blending
of
flavors
o
this
beer
seems
to
have
more
malts
and
sweetness
similar
to
a
tripel
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
it
is
still
relatively
easy
to
drink
othere
are
so
many
other
saisons
out
there
balance
isnt
where
it
should
be
no
spices
o
not
bad
lots
of
spice
which
i
enjoy
but
other
than
that
is
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
its
certainly
belgium
influenced
but
i
dont
see
it
falling
into
the
saison
style
maybe
more
along
the
lines
of
a
very
spice
belgium
pale
or
a
not
very
good
tripel
overall
it
was
a
decent
drink
but
i
likely
wouldnt
have
one
again
this
is
a
rather
refreshing
saison
it
has
a
nice
citrusy
fruity
flavor
that
is
balanced
and
enjoyable
its
also
easy
to
drink
i
will
probably
pick
this
up
again
o
an
excellent
saison
i
will
be
purchasing
this
one
again
impressed
with
another
one
of
great
divides
beers
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
bottled
on
march
23
2012
this
pours
a
hazy
straw
light
yellow
color
with
a
short
lived
off
white
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
nice
lots
of
sweet
yeast
esters
a
little
funk
some
earthy
tones
good
stuff
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
great
nice
fruit
yeast
esters
a
dry
finish
some
earthy
flavors
good
stuff
a
weird
girl
this
colette
the
overbearing
fruits
and
odd
tang
make
me
think
its
not
really
to
style
not
my
favorite
gd
brew
overall
colette
is
an
interesting
beer
that
seems
like
a
good
introduction
to
farmhouse
ales
for
me
this
is
definitely
a
unique
style
but
its
also
not
my
favorite
at
this
point
however
i
wont
hesitate
to
try
other
farmhouse
ale
saisons
in
the
future
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
glad
i
bought
the
sampler
pack
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
rice
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
of
grain
citrus
fruit
citrus
zest
yeast
and
spices
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
flavor
wise
but
the
aroma
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
my
opinion
overall
a
nice
standard
saison
it
isnt
expecitional
in
any
one
way
but
it
represents
the
style
very
well
bottle
poured
a
hazy
lightly
dirty
yellow
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
funky
yeast
notes
with
light
rustic
malt
with
a
subtle
sour
finish
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
light
funky
notes
with
some
light
tart
notes
and
some
light
rustic
malt
light
residual
sugar
is
also
discernable
body
is
quite
full
with
great
bottle
conditioning
and
good
carbonation
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
but
well
brewed
for
something
that
is
most
likely
brewed
on
a
very
large
scale
overall
a
real
refreshing
and
nice
saison
hardly
booze
either
at
7
3
percent
too
i
know
a
lot
of
these
things
are
typical
for
the
style
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
that
said
its
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
a
favorite
o
a
very
impressive
offering
wonderful
flavor
complex
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
goes
well
with
food
to
boot
i
highly
recommend
if
you
enjoy
saisons
or
unfiltered
beers
light
to
medium
bodied
flows
easily
over
the
tongue
and
refreshes
very
high
carbonation
tart
and
dry
finish
smoother
than
some
low
abv
saisons
ive
had
cant
complain
there
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
bright
hazy
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
spices
wheat
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
banana
spices
wheat
and
grain
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
while
this
one
was
quite
refreshing
it
was
also
not
very
memorable
at
the
same
time
nothing
on
this
one
really
stood
out
and
tried
to
grab
your
attention
which
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
drinking
this
one
out
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
might
be
enjoyable
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
enjoy
complexities
on
i
would
go
with
something
else
unless
you
are
into
that
simply
refreshing
and
simply
a
delight
i
knew
colette
would
be
a
reasonable
choice
for
this
late
afternoon
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
so
easy
it
looks
that
great
divide
can
also
do
that
belgian
thing
too
great
divide
collette
farmhouse
ale
bright
golden
color
nice
creamy
head
and
a
big
aroma
of
belgian
hops
invite
you
to
take
a
sip
the
flavor
transports
you
to
well
not
a
belgian
farmhouse
but
rather
a
belgian
abbey
the
collette
is
a
lighter
belgian
trippel
in
by
view
and
a
good
one
at
that
the
flavor
is
a
pleasant
floral
sweetness
infused
with
distinctive
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
a
chalky
finish
call
it
what
you
will
but
anyway
the
collette
is
another
great
beer
from
great
divide
o
drinkable
for
the
style
which
i
am
usually
not
fond
of
oda
solid
saison
i
prefer
my
saisons
to
be
funkier
and
more
tart
this
is
pretty
legit
however
i
only
bout
a
single
but
this
runs
around
12
25
for
a
six
pack
in
my
area
quite
overpriced
still
decent
overall
3
5
i
love
the
fact
that
you
can
get
a
decent
saison
in
a
sixer
without
paying
an
arm
and
a
leg
but
it
also
doesnt
really
hold
its
own
against
the
really
good
examples
of
the
style
also
the
appearance
is
really
a
bummer
i
wanted
to
like
this
more
but
for
my
money
id
rather
spend
a
little
more
and
get
something
ill
only
have
once
in
a
while
still
waiting
for
that
great
saison
in
affordable
12oz
bottles
other
than
hennepin
which
for
the
record
i
do
enjoy
quite
a
bit
drank
on
522012
bottled
3262012
m
enjoyable
carbonation
that
is
pleasant
in
the
mouth
overall
nice
summery
beer
though
not
a
real
standout
drinkability
a
good
and
simple
saison
the
taste
has
a
little
complexity
im
liking
the
saison
wheat
and
white
beers
this
spring
d
rather
good
actually
the
individual
pieces
combine
to
make
an
excellent
saison
o
while
it
sure
is
refreshing
it
is
sort
of
one
dimensional
nose
is
dominated
by
funk
and
citrus
taste
is
essentially
the
same
i
will
do
an
updated
review
as
it
is
a
cold
night
and
i
just
might
not
be
in
the
mood
for
this
style
but
as
of
now
its
good
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
great
divide
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
light
summer
saison
and
definitely
a
beer
that
would
go
down
well
on
a
warm
afternoonevening
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
easy
to
drink
and
worth
getting
another
very
pale
hazy
yellow
appearance
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
gave
this
look
a
bit
of
a
macro
vibe
but
the
lemon
zest
and
orange
peel
on
the
nose
indicated
that
this
was
not
one
of
the
mass
produced
swill
the
taste
was
pretty
timid
for
a
saison
with
flavors
of
lemon
simple
sugar
and
white
pepper
coming
across
each
light
and
refreshing
sip
the
abv
felt
nowhere
near
7
3
and
the
body
was
soft
and
airy
very
refreshing
but
left
me
longing
for
more
depth
o
the
first
saison
to
make
me
realize
i
love
the
style
tart
apple
and
pear
with
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
up
front
some
medicinal
flavors
around
mid
palate
enough
just
to
balance
the
sweetness
coupled
by
a
spicy
grassy
yeast
presence
and
a
bright
clean
finish
sour
yet
subdued
fruity
yet
dry
complex
yet
pleasant
an
overall
fantastic
and
complex
beer
with
incredible
layers
of
flavor
perfect
for
spring
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
is
for
a
bit
less
phenolic
flavors
otherwise
nothing
less
than
great
from
great
divide
it
tastes
more
like
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
and
thats
an
improvement
the
burp
is
yummy
i
will
continue
to
avoid
the
style
but
i
dont
regret
geting
this
one
overall
very
well
done
lots
of
fruits
and
sugars
and
a
little
alcohol
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
excellent
springtime
ale
o
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
can
crush
a
six
pack
in
a
matter
of
minutes
its
ridiculously
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
in
the
end
itll
get
you
drunk
if
you
pound
it
back
like
i
do
pours
a
sandy
whitish
yellow
with
a
slight
white
head
aroma
is
strongly
belgian
yeasty
with
some
spiciness
and
pepper
sweet
but
bright
lemon
and
some
wheat
flavor
pretty
much
followed
suit
a
medium
bodied
active
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
nice
beer
but
held
back
a
little
because
its
one
i
could
only
enjoy
in
moderation
my
16
oz
pour
was
the
perfect
amount
i
couldnt
drink
any
more
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
one
doesnt
blow
me
away
nor
turn
me
away
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
love
to
try
on
draft
nope
this
one
pours
a
thick
hazy
yellow
color
like
a
lemon
with
yeast
floaters
and
a
small
white
head
smells
really
yeast
and
not
nice
wild
yeast
like
a
lot
of
other
saisons
but
like
rotting
citrus
fruit
and
shampoo
that
said
there
is
some
element
of
refreshing
aromas
but
the
yeast
spoils
it
for
me
flavor
is
not
bad
tart
and
crisp
lemon
notes
mild
spice
and
some
crystal
malt
body
not
sure
how
this
one
got
so
far
off
track
but
the
feel
is
not
nice
either
way
way
to
thick
and
heavy
for
the
style
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
crisp
drinkable
early
summer
beer
but
it
fails
to
serve
that
purpose
this
might
be
my
least
favorite
great
divide
beer
so
far
which
is
unfortunate
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
one
as
i
am
huge
on
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
but
this
was
a
real
letdown
might
be
better
from
the
bottle
rather
than
the
tap
o
this
is
a
good
american
saison
the
yeast
and
malt
profile
are
right
on
this
beer
is
also
dry
and
slightly
fruity
as
it
should
be
one
of
my
favorites
when
spring
rolls
around
notes
medium
in
body
with
good
depth
and
flavor
very
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
but
manageable
overall
a
tasty
farmhouse
brew
and
a
solid
offering
from
great
divide
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
as
stated
above
very
refreshing
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
well
made
and
interesting
brew
i
got
a
good
deal
one
12
oz
bottle
for
1
50
i
might
get
it
again
my
beer
rating
4
0
overall
im
glad
to
have
finally
found
this
to
think
it
was
in
the
store
i
frequent
most
just
being
hidden
in
the
back
of
the
cooler
after
a
year
or
so
its
drinking
nice
i
havent
had
the
fresh
or
any
really
old
stuff
but
id
imagine
that
its
only
going
to
get
better
overall
great
relaxing
type
sit
down
summer
evening
beer
golden
color
with
tons
of
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
very
nice
smell
that
is
somewhat
difficult
to
describe
lemons
are
present
earthy
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
citrus
and
earthy
as
well
mild
bitterness
very
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
this
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
o
good
representation
of
the
style
excellent
session
brew
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
back
fruity
in
the
front
very
interesting
and
pleasant
i
look
forward
to
another
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
belgian
yeast
with
some
lemon
and
white
pepper
notes
overall
it
smells
about
like
a
saison
is
supposed
to
smell
the
flavor
is
also
typical
saison
i
get
a
lot
of
yeast
and
pepper
as
well
as
some
biscuit
malt
there
is
a
little
bit
of
light
funk
in
the
flavor
the
beer
is
very
dry
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
it
surpassed
what
i
was
expecting
i
will
buy
this
one
again
id
recommend
at
least
giving
it
a
try
even
if
it
isnt
your
favorite
style
o
unlike
other
funky
or
tart
saisons
for
me
this
is
almost
hefeweizen
like
in
taste
eitherway
a
nice
refreshing
beer
o
overall
a
pleasant
beer
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
allaround
beer
but
a
bit
off
from
the
norms
of
the
style
to
rate
well
look
forward
to
revisiting
at
some
point
this
is
a
really
solid
flavorful
farmhouse
alee
thats
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
farmhouse
ale
it
has
good
carbination
the
taste
is
sour
but
more
tart
it
has
a
solid
appearance
and
good
nose
theres
a
reason
its
a
silver
medal
winner
gabf
2010
if
you
enjoy
farm
house
alessours
try
it
for
yourself
and
see
while
this
isnt
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
had
i
not
seen
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
who
brewed
this
someone
who
has
never
tried
this
style
before
would
be
wise
to
start
here
this
isnt
too
overpowering
and
is
a
textbook
example
of
what
a
good
saisonfarmhouse
should
be
since
the
funky
and
spicy
notes
are
absent
here
id
certainly
have
this
again
o
a
really
great
saison
i
found
this
to
be
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
my
summer
2011
favorite
everyday
ale
o
very
good
saison
great
choice
for
warmer
weather
flavor
is
sweet
and
crisp
with
hints
of
citrus
fruits
and
spice
theres
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
very
tasty
and
full
of
flavor
highly
carbonated
as
id
want
a
summer
beer
pleasant
that
way
overall
colette
is
a
good
beer
it
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
its
not
exceptional
but
a
solid
homage
to
saisons
like
the
label
explains
overall
i
really
dont
have
much
to
say
positive
about
this
beer
im
going
to
try
to
drink
the
whole
thing
but
its
a
borderline
drainpour
to
me
i
definitely
wont
buy
this
again
the
other
great
divide
beers
have
been
well
crafted
this
one
seems
way
off
mark
to
me
overall
impression
tons
of
fruit
and
malt
character
but
too
much
carbonation
and
light
attributes
i
like
a
ton
of
flavor
and
character
to
saisons
and
this
one
just
didnt
pop
i
will
give
it
good
overall
ratings
because
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
but
i
just
cant
rate
it
better
than
any
of
the
fantomes
or
other
saisons
from
top
breweries
would
definitely
enjoy
again
if
seen
in
a
6pack
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
bottle
march
3
2011
pours
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
fairly
dense
2
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
lacing
cap
a
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
huge
grass
lemon
pepper
spices
bread
a
bit
of
funk
and
some
light
fruitsapple
grape
very
nice
and
complex
aromas
here
taste
of
grass
lemon
pepper
spices
grape
and
a
slight
bit
of
funk
very
slight
bit
of
tartness
noticed
on
the
finish
lingering
notes
of
spices
lemon
pepper
and
breadiness
on
the
finish
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
quite
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
for
the
alcohol
level
medium
carbonation
and
body
no
alcohol
noticed
in
the
taste
or
finish
overall
a
very
nice
saison
with
nice
flavor
and
balance
this
is
just
another
unimpressive
interpretation
of
a
belgian
style
from
an
american
brewery
its
an
ok
beer
i
picked
up
way
more
bread
undertones
than
most
while
its
a
bit
offputting
its
intriguing
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
for
one
that
has
a
lot
going
on
if
the
finish
could
have
a
slightly
dryer
bite
it
would
nail
the
saison
style
stone
cold
overall
a
good
saison
by
all
means
id
like
to
enjoy
this
beer
more
but
i
cant
bring
myself
to
do
so
honestly
its
kind
of
a
mess
great
look
and
mouthfeel
odd
nose
and
taste
drinkability
a
very
nice
summer
bear
i
think
not
as
refreshing
as
the
samurai
but
different
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
saison
it
really
is
more
of
a
wit
and
should
call
itself
that
instead
not
something
i
would
want
to
see
year
round
but
for
a
seasonal
it
could
work
heft
of
malt
weight
to
it
a
delight
wish
i
had
more
d
if
this
wasnt
10
a
sixpack
i
would
excuse
it
but
rating
it
against
others
in
the
style
with
the
pricepoint
id
much
rather
buy
something
dont
seek
out
like
a
wheat
beer
with
a
splash
of
belgian
yeast
overallim
glad
theres
a
6
pack
saison
out
there
but
i
really
wasnt
turned
on
too
much
by
this
beer
this
was
much
better
than
expected
i
am
beginning
to
like
this
brewery
after
trying
a
few
of
their
beers
cant
go
wrong
with
this
saison
will
definitely
have
again
good
beer
overall
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
at
7
percent
alcohol
wouldnt
be
bringing
this
one
to
the
beach
this
is
my
favorite
summer
beer
so
far
i
look
forward
to
my
next
bottle
of
this
excellent
beer
o
every
time
i
try
a
new
saison
i
say
its
my
new
favorite
not
this
time
its
great
but
ive
had
betterinsert
jim
carry
face
from
liar
liar
here
o
very
drinkable
i
will
go
back
for
more
of
this
for
sure
o
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
saison
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
by
the
pool
or
anytime
during
the
summer
o
overall
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
the
flavor
didnt
quite
hold
up
to
the
sweetness
that
the
aroma
promised
but
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
saved
this
beer
for
me
dont
know
if
ill
go
back
to
this
but
it
was
pleasing
enough
overall
pretty
descent
saison
not
great
divides
best
brew
by
any
means
but
they
can
definitely
make
a
good
saison
overall
a
very
good
american
saison
that
could
become
a
staple
of
my
yearly
rotations
simple
easy
and
pleasant
no
faults
more
of
a
belgian
pale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
saison
maybe
not
my
favorite
so
far
but
pretty
good
nevertheless
overall
a
wellbalanced
saison
thats
worth
two
or
three
servings
per
sitting
not
groundbreaking
by
any
means
just
pleasant
and
refreshing
more
of
an
aperitif
saison
or
perhaps
something
to
pair
with
a
fresh
goatcheese
salad
sparingly
topped
with
a
honeybased
dressing
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
pale
straw
a
almost
snow
white
head
was
on
top
fairly
thin
but
lasted
well
a
bit
of
cling
to
the
sides
fairly
constant
streams
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
had
hints
of
a
fruity
sweetness
also
noticed
a
bit
of
yeast
and
just
a
tad
of
alcohol
flavor
was
multi
layered
started
out
a
bit
like
a
hard
cider
hints
of
sweet
apples
with
a
finish
of
tartness
if
it
warmed
up
it
became
sweeter
with
less
tartness
occasionally
picked
up
some
yeasty
bready
but
it
was
very
subtle
felt
great
in
the
mouth
well
balanced
nicely
carbonated
coated
well
overall
a
well
rounded
surprisingly
pleasant
beer
o
very
rustic
and
old
countryold
world
like
i
think
they
nailed
what
they
were
going
after
in
this
one
doesnt
have
the
best
drinkability
but
worth
trying
out
o
pretty
decent
beer
for
a
hot
day
pretty
refreshing
not
one
i
would
seek
out
o
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
really
can
take
a
bunch
of
these
as
it
tastes
great
and
goes
down
every
easy
a
says
not
as
much
champagne
like
qualities
as
expected
o
tasty
and
interesting
i
would
have
it
again
cheers
this
is
a
very
good
american
saison
a
good
drinking
refreshing
brew
o
7
3abv
i
would
have
guessed
below
6abv
because
i
couldnt
taste
anything
but
malty
yeasty
goodness
maybe
if
i
had
this
super
fresh
it
would
kill
but
its
still
pretty
good
o
good
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
is
fresh
find
this
one
fresh
and
jump
on
it
very
crisp
and
refreshing
if
a
little
onedimensional
not
overly
funky
and
very
easydrinking
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
saison
that
has
a
lot
of
differences
than
most
examples
of
the
style
the
addition
of
wild
yeast
makes
me
curious
how
this
will
hold
up
in
the
cellar
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
it
was
clean
and
refreshing
yet
had
a
bit
of
viscosity
to
it
as
well
lively
carbonation
added
to
the
feel
and
it
produced
a
slight
mouthwatering
effect
in
the
finish
it
didnt
seem
like
a
7
3
abv
as
it
was
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
am
glad
to
have
found
it
not
as
flavorfull
as
some
saisons
but
dryer
and
crisper
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
that
beer
that
was
well
balanced
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
its
worth
trying
and
ill
be
buying
it
again
overall
a
great
refreshing
beer
to
have
at
the
beginning
of
summer
excellent
tasting
and
one
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
o
certainly
not
the
most
refreshing
of
saisons
but
from
what
ive
had
of
the
style
thus
far
it
would
be
a
delicious
food
beer
i
tried
it
with
a
bit
of
sausage
and
the
fattiness
really
complimented
the
funk
and
enhanced
the
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
refreshing
moderately
funk
saison
this
tastes
like
it
came
right
out
of
a
barn
extremely
quaffable
just
not
very
beery
on
he
whimsical
side
like
a
good
wit
pours
a
nice
fluffy
tall
head
that
dissipates
a
little
quicker
than
i
expected
color
is
hazy
yellow
aroma
definitely
lemon
but
a
little
sweeter
like
lemon
curd
i
also
got
some
toasted
grain
and
a
nice
yeastiness
flavor
echos
the
aroma
but
with
a
tartness
that
you
wouldnt
necessarily
get
from
another
saison
such
as
saison
dupont
the
tartness
allows
you
to
come
back
for
more
without
wearing
on
your
palate
pours
a
straw
color
with
minimal
white
head
nose
is
mixed
citrus
with
a
hint
of
human
bile
pineapple
some
barnyard
on
the
nose
too
on
the
palate
theres
some
spice
pineapple
more
funk
and
a
zestylemony
citrus
quality
finishes
lemony
and
crackerlike
rather
dry
cracker
like
o
tasty
and
refreshing
with
some
sour
funky
belgian
farmhouse
tastes
the
color
is
like
heavilycarbonated
lemonade
capped
with
white
fluff
the
aroma
is
an
odd
mix
of
fruit
and
wheat
with
citrus
the
taste
had
the
same
flavors
with
a
bit
of
floral
added
but
it
had
a
bit
of
a
dirty
dish
water
essence
to
it
that
i
didnt
find
it
very
appealing
the
body
seemed
watery
and
the
aftertaste
wasnt
much
it
is
a
passable
beer
but
there
are
many
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
overallnotes
kind
of
a
vapid
brew
saison
is
a
style
i
always
enjoy
and
this
one
fits
right
in
with
the
others
i
guess
it
neither
excels
nor
fails
when
compared
to
other
brews
of
the
type
certainly
worth
a
visit
or
two
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
like
i
am
an
excellent
beer
with
a
golden
yellow
color
forming
a
clean
crisp
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
typical
ale
however
the
mouthfeel
because
of
the
carbonation
gives
a
champagne
quality
to
the
beer
has
a
slight
coriander
and
star
anise
taste
giving
the
beer
a
belgian
feel
makes
an
excellent
summer
beer
got
it
at
ithaca
coffee
company
in
ithaca
ny
o
nice
easy
drinking
saison
good
balance
abv
is
undetectable
o
i
would
drink
this
again
and
recommend
to
new
saison
drinkers
o
ive
never
tried
this
particular
style
from
great
divide
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
blew
me
away
i
was
expecting
to
hate
another
beer
and
loved
it
will
buy
again
overall
in
general
very
goodtasting
and
very
true
to
the
style
which
i
appreciate
o
hmmm
not
really
sure
here
it
would
seem
this
would
be
refreshing
on
the
porch
in
the
summertime
perhaps
as
a
light
after
dinner
cleansing
beer
however
im
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sittingdayweekend
and
the
abv
doesnt
help
that
much
this
beer
seems
complex
and
it
is
i
just
think
there
is
a
little
too
much
going
on
and
its
not
for
me
great
aroma
not
so
great
flavors
everything
seems
bland
with
added
sucrose
colette
is
not
the
best
saison
that
i
have
ever
partaken
of
but
it
is
a
solid
american
brewed
version
of
the
style
this
brew
is
crisp
fresh
and
thirst
quenching
making
it
a
perfect
brew
as
we
transition
into
summer
oa
very
well
balanced
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
a
decent
saison
decently
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
the
funk
in
the
nose
i
wish
it
was
more
present
in
the
taste
not
bad
o
kind
of
all
over
the
place
for
me
good
summer
beer
though
and
i
love
the
scent
and
the
substantial
mouthfeel
a
steal
at
7
99
a
6er
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
due
to
the
ham
more
ham
when
fresh
the
ones
i
let
wait
a
month
or
two
were
lacking
the
pork
i
wanted
drink
its
pretty
tasty
and
a
bit
different
and
the
flavors
are
a
bit
small
but
its
a
nice
beer
i
might
come
back
to
this
one
because
of
point
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
not
quite
hennepin
but
not
bad
either
12oz
bottle
pour
hazy
light
golden
color
with
white
head
very
active
carbonation
aroma
has
grass
wheat
and
some
lemon
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
tart
spiciness
as
well
thin
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
finish
is
dry
any
ok
beer
that
would
be
better
if
the
abv
were
lower
then
this
would
at
least
be
sessionable
as
it
is
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
my
drink
of
the
night
or
day
while
probably
not
the
highest
example
of
a
saison
it
is
a
very
well
done
beer
o
did
not
like
this
one
just
too
much
lemon
did
not
finish
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemons
hay
and
leather
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
lemon
orange
and
mildy
funky
barnyard
notes
what
is
there
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
is
nice
but
lacks
depth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
but
there
are
much
better
saisons
out
there
o
pretty
good
stuff
ill
give
it
a
4
on
overall
rating
despite
being
mildly
disappointed
on
my
second
tasting
tonight
out
of
a
glass
you
cant
find
that
many
affordable
saisons
in
6packs
and
thats
worth
a
lot
during
grilling
season
overall
some
nice
flavors
here
but
hampered
slightly
by
the
mouthfeel
great
divide
makes
some
great
americanenglish
ales
but
they
have
yet
to
prove
to
me
that
they
can
make
an
excellent
belgian
brew
although
this
is
damn
close
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
this
beer
extremely
easily
drinkable
it
has
the
perfect
balance
in
drying
and
sweet
flavors
its
just
overall
to
me
a
very
enjoyable
flavor
profile
this
beer
is
also
extremely
refreshing
which
makes
it
superb
as
a
summertime
beer
could
see
easily
downing
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
the
alcohol
is
even
deceptively
high
at
7
2
considering
it
just
seems
so
easily
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
especially
for
the
season
overall
pretty
good
version
of
farmhouse
i
might
have
to
try
this
one
on
tap
o
a
very
enjoyable
saison
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
gd
must
be
commended
on
this
venture
though
i
applaud
the
format
and
the
risktaking
much
more
exciting
than
the
stupid
beers
coming
out
of
stone
lately
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
more
toward
the
hoppy
saisons
that
remind
me
of
some
tripels
but
this
is
still
a
solid
attempt
at
the
style
i
suspect
that
they
are
using
their
belgian
yeast
that
was
in
belgio
sp
on
this
beer
too
as
i
was
getting
the
same
bread
dough
notes
in
the
aroma
but
that
may
just
be
a
finishing
yeast
for
this
beer
as
the
saison
yeasts
never
attenuate
all
that
well
either
way
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
the
whole
6pack
i
doubt
i
will
be
buying
it
again
at
least
any
time
soon
but
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
o
average
saison
a
bit
too
tart
but
not
bad
with
all
the
citrus
it
seems
to
meld
wit
and
saison
characteristics
to
make
for
a
nice
beer
bottom
line
damn
yet
another
winner
from
great
divide
not
too
tart
not
too
dry
not
too
anything
great
malt
base
expert
use
of
notoriously
difficult
yeast
and
staying
true
to
style
as
i
know
it
great
beer
here
recommended
the
liquid
is
cloudy
pale
and
yellow
with
a
thin
filmy
white
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
salt
banana
clove
and
sour
lemon
the
taste
starts
with
some
tart
lemon
then
you
get
some
yeast
and
spice
banana
and
a
grassy
lemony
finish
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
stinging
carbonation
and
a
seriously
dry
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
has
a
little
something
for
everyone
overall
pretty
good
but
im
still
on
the
search
for
a
saison
that
i
can
drink
every
day
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
does
not
retain
well
or
leave
any
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
lemongrass
the
taste
starts
with
grassy
hop
notes
and
then
moves
to
banana
and
spicy
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
balanced
and
finishes
smooth
overall
a
great
saison
plenty
of
yeasty
spice
up
front
dry
and
earthy
in
the
middle
clove
and
pepper
spiciness
lemon
cookie
with
a
light
weizen
yeast
sweetness
and
lingering
impression
of
weeds
or
wildflowers
faint
aftertaste
of
clover
honey
well
carbonated
slightly
creamy
interesting
enough
not
as
dry
and
crisp
as
belgian
saisons
sweeter
more
spicy
and
yeast
driven
o
a
good
complex
beer
not
the
best
saison
but
certainly
a
decent
one
for
a
readily
available
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
nice
though
its
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
but
overall
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
then
again
its
not
a
style
i
tend
to
enjoy
so
your
mileage
may
vary
overall
this
beer
is
quite
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
you
can
do
better
gd
give
me
any
yeti
overall
an
okay
attempt
dont
know
that
id
pick
this
again
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
a
spring
or
summer
day
would
go
great
w
burgers
or
maybe
even
a
summer
salad
some
bbq
may
go
nicely
w
this
too
as
im
drinking
this
i
keep
getting
pictures
in
my
mind
of
a
backyard
party
w
friends
prosit
o
a
solid
american
saison
but
not
too
impressive
youre
not
getting
dupont
had
this
in
95
degree
heat
on
the
patio
perfect
for
the
occasion
and
one
i
definitely
have
again
great
offering
from
great
divide
this
is
definitely
one
to
enjoy
when
the
weather
gets
warmer
very
enjoyable
refreshing
recommended
colette
is
a
nice
farmhouse
offering
nothing
earth
shattering
here
at
the
same
time
theres
no
real
missteps
either
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
for
a
potentially
dangerous
quaff
props
to
great
divide
for
making
another
tasty
brew
great
divide
delivers
again
with
another
great
example
of
style
this
one
is
refreshing
and
appreciably
complex
bright
brew
for
summer
days
ahead
doverall
this
is
no
sasion
come
in
to
this
expecting
some
barnyard
funk
and
youll
be
disappointed
if
youre
wanting
a
decent
pale
belgian
then
this
wont
upset
you
it
does
go
down
easily
for
the
abv
so
many
similarities
to
a
wit
keeps
me
from
liking
it
more
but
interesting
and
worth
trying
yup
its
a
bit
sweet
in
the
taste
overall
its
flavors
are
nice
breadywith
spice
coriander
florals
a
bit
of
soft
citrus
fairly
rich
is
the
mouth
id
like
to
see
more
of
something
to
cleanse
the
finish
but
still
very
nice
very
drinkable
this
would
be
the
perfect
summer
beer
a
lighter
saison
than
most
ive
had
with
less
of
a
hop
presence
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
really
enjoy
it
and
will
return
to
it
if
i
see
it
again
d
this
is
a
fantastic
interpretation
of
a
belgian
farmhouse
or
saison
style
the
belgian
yeast
is
perfect
funk
to
the
malt
and
the
mild
hops
clean
and
crisp
with
tart
citrus
fruits
terroir
and
medicinal
flavors
love
the
dry
lingering
finish
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
just
sitting
on
the
porch
enjoyable
is
the
name
of
the
game
nothing
crazy
but
a
nice
easy
drinker
that
is
good
on
a
hot
day
worth
a
try
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
very
light
and
completely
transparent
yellow
a
little
head
tops
the
beer
but
way
less
than
i
am
accustomed
to
with
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
style
the
carbonation
is
actually
visible
smell
roasted
corn
cloves
tart
banana
taste
big
clove
up

very
sweet
for
the
style
mouthfeel
major
carbonation
on
this
is
nice
and
refreshing
drinkability
i
am
overall
pleased
with
this
take
on
farmhouse
ale
and
find
this
beer
to
be
a
great
refreshing
spring
beer
that
would
really
work
well
outside
in
the
sun
with
friends
o
very
drinkable
crisp
refreshing
and
juicy
i
could
enjoy
several
of
these
and
not
get
bored
with
it
d
ill
rereview
the
beer
if
i
get
a
chance
to
have
a
fresh
bottle
but
for
2
year
old
belgian
this
didnt
seem
to
age
all
that
well
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
medium
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
tart
with
a
little
yeasty
baguette
breadiness
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
bready
while
also
maintaining
a
subtle
tartness
the
beer
is
nicely
dry
and
lightly
fruity
with
a
bit
of
lemon
rind
enjoyable
and
one
more
reason
id
like
to
see
great
divide
back
in
iowa
notes
great
divide
is
right
on
with
very
tasty
farmhouse
ale
drinkability
in
many
respects
an
excellent
saison
though
it
verges
just
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
one
of
the
better
saisons
made
in
usa
d
good
saison
fine
beer
get
it
a
go
excellent
light
summer
offering
for
any
newbie
or
beer
geek
d
drinkability
is
high
there
is
no
trace
of
the
7
3
alcohol
in
this
beer
and
the
flavors
remain
fresh
and
vibrant
throughout
the
whole
glass
its
almost
like
drinking
a
highly
carbonated
juice
in
the
best
way
possible
d
i
had
a
hard
time
with
the
carbonation
on
this
one
d
nice
zippy
spicy
refreshing
beer
complex
flavor
profile
goes
down
smooth
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
wellcrafted
brew
but
the
style
isnt
really
my
favorite
if
youre
a
saison
fan
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
comparable
to
many
runofthemill
belgian
saisons
they
nailed
it
but
of
course
but
a
good
old
american
spin
on
the
style
in
terms
of
its
stickierchewier
mouthfeel
and
the
slightly
bolder
flavor
than
the
more
subtle
creations
of
the
homeland
farmhouse
ales
excellent
stuff
that
i
wish
theyd
sell
in
a
bomber
as
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
bit
more
of
this
right
now
overall
this
is
by
far
my
least
favorite
beer
from
a
brewery
i
really
love
hey
cant
nail
em
all
i
guess
drinkability
ive
never
been
inclined
to
drink
much
more
than
one
saison
at
a
time
and
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
an
exception
to
that
rule
i
think
the
peppery
spice
always
seems
to
make
it
sessionprohibitive
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
great
divide
has
done
another
great
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
pour
is
a
hazy
light
straw
color
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
lots
of
fluffy
white
head
and
i
mean
a
lot
i
had
to
stop
the
pour
into
my
glass
from
this
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
head
reduces
leaving
behind
sticky
soapy
looking
lace
the
aroma
is
full
your
typical
of
a
saison
lemon
up
front
with
biscuit
and
hints
of
pepper
with
slight
hops
kicking
around
the
back
of
the
nose
this
smell
has
a
lot
of
lemon
up
front
in
it
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
nicely
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
lemon
zing
the
abv
on
this
is
higher
than
i
realized
but
i
would
think
it
is
much
lower
by
the
taste
this
isnt
really
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
but
it
seems
to
be
done
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
ample
carbonation
and
again
i
wouldnt
think
this
is
over
seven
percent
highly
drinkable
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
for
a
decent
price
the
head
retention
on
this
is
good
the
smell
is
dead
on
dead
for
a
farmhouse
ale
tons
of
belgian
yeast
goodness
no
particularly
fruity
notes
and
the
flavor
is
a
little
clean
for
the
farmhouse
genre
nothing
too
special
to
taste
the
color
was
beautiful
and
it
had
an
exceptional
lacing
i
could
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
need
to
know
what
i
mean
d
well
i
have
two
more
and
plan
to
have
one
more
now
but
damn
this
is
the
best
drinkable
saison
i
ever
had
i
hope
the
same
with
age
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
after
the
fizz
fizzles
out
very
nice
drinker
a
keeper
for
those
who
like
this
style
good
but
not
a
great
beer
colette
just
does
not
match
my
preferences
in
the
style
very
drinkable
and
i
was
able
to
enjoy
worth
a
try
you
may
like
it
more
than
i
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
with
moderate
carbonation
smells
of
tropical
fruits
with
some
belgian
yeast
tastes
of
belgain
malts
fruits
and
farmhouse
funk
with
some
dry
undertones
at
the
end
an
overall
complex
brew
and
rare
saison
avaiable
in
a
6
pack
a
perfect
summer
beer
for
those
looking
a
for
a
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
poured
from
12oz
bottle
instant
noticable
aroma
of
pineapply
fruitness
with
slight
hint
of
lemon
leaves
a
creamy
film
like
feel
in
your
mouth
after
first
or
second
gulp
reminds
me
of
champagne
with
a
milder
carbonation
factor
drinkability
is
there
but
not
a
beer
that
can
be
pounded
one
after
the
other
overall
usualy
steering
away
from
belgians
or
anything
that
has
a
funky
clove
or
odd
fruity
smell
this
one
isnt
too
shabby
this
brew
alone
has
me
curious
into
other
farmhouse
ales
out
there
a
lovely
beer
all
around
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
dry
and
carbonated
brew
though
the
complexities
make
up
for
it
poured
a
light
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
creamy
two
fingered
fluffy
head
with
patchy
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
glass
spicy
citrus
aromas
with
yeasty
bread
hints
holy
smokes
tantilized
and
caressed
both
palette
and
tongue
this
farmhouse
wench
bubbly
with
a
certain
sassy
spiceness
colette
yeah
two
thumbs
up
d
i
will
definitely
give
this
one
another
try
in
general
its
a
little
thin
and
just
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
might
be
missing
something
the
first
time
through
true
to
style
though
it
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
a
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
foamy
head
that
leaves
lots
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
yeasty
lemonand
tart
fruit
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
a
bready
edge
mildly
tart
and
spicy
finish
really
good
version
of
this
style
great
divide
strikes
again
as
i
cant
wait
until
next
spring
so
i
can
find
more
american
saisons
are
in
full
swing
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
domestic
breweries
are
capable
of
citrus
particularly
lemon
zest
and
orange
peel
and
some
sour
apple
head
off
the
flavors
bready
yeasts
and
coriander
take
over
the
middle
setting
their
own
distinction
from
what
is
first
tasted
a
third
level
of
complexity
is
brought
into
the
finish
where
a
couple
of
dashes
of
banana
shakes
hands
with
peppery
spices
there
is
the
slightest
of
alcohol
warmness
at
the
end
but
is
hidden
very
well
to
the
point
where
one
might
not
realize
theyre
sipping
on
something
in
the
7
5
abv
range
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
peppery
scent
along
with
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
aroma
its
quite
spicy
with
lots
of
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
its
smooth
with
a
nice
pale
wheat
and
munich
malt
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
but
its
curbed
with
loads
of
yeast
spiciness
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
dry
funky
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
im
not
crazy
with
either
the
malt
bill
or
yeast
character
i
could
drink
it
till
i
pass
out
dthis
beer
is
very
drinkableespecially
to
finish
off
a
summer
evening
a
transparent
brew
with
minimal
lacing
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
and
flavors
of
wheat
crackers
lemon
zest
and
very
minimal
chevre
cheese
not
a
very
aggressive
saison
but
highly
drinkable
no
problems
here
and
i
am
stoked
about
a
saison
sixer
d
an
excellent
summer
beer
and
great
example
of
the
style
despite
the
lively
appearance
of
this
beer
it
is
only
lightly
carbonated
finishes
offdry
quenchinga
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
by
the
crock
as
i
worked
the
fields
at
the
farm
though
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
on
the
whole
still
quite
pleasant
verdict
id
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
but
i
ended
up
being
a
little
disappointed
colette
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beerin
fact
its
pretty
solidit
just
isnt
particularly
interesting
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
complexity
is
minimal
so
im
grading
this
down
some
largely
lacks
the
funk
and
earthiness
i
like
in
a
saison
but
it
has
some
character
tastes
something
like
a
belgian
pale
or
wit
actually
particularly
as
it
gets
warmer
notbad
saison
not
too
distinctive
either
will
give
a
nice
yeast
kick
and
alcohol
fix
on
a
warm
day
not
really
familiar
with
saisons
only
had
a
couple
before
anyway
this
one
was
pretty
good
it
had
a
very
impressive
fluffy
head
which
died
out
to
a
good
lacing
the
beer
itself
was
a
cloudy
golden
color
reminded
me
of
a
hefe
smell
wasnt
too
strong
but
what
i
did
get
was
hints
of
wheat
and
malt
not
too
much
on
the
hops
taste
was
somewhat
wheaty
and
fruity
maybe
a
slight
sour
bite
to
it
no
detection
of
alcohol
what
so
ever
which
is
impressive
considering
its
over
7
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
great
on
a
hot
summer
night
or
even
after
i
do
hours
of
yard
work
d
good
drinkability
even
with
the
7
abv
not
the
greatest
saison
but
very
very
good
d
not
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
but
at
only
roughly
2
for
this
bottle
its
one
of
the
best
for
the
money
another
great
brew
from
gd
overall
a
bit
mild
and
more
of
a
lemony
wheat
beer
not
super
complex
but
good
d
very
nice
and
goes
down
easy
on
a
hot
day
fairly
good
farmhouse
a
bit
too
tart
and
sweet
for
regular
drinking
but
good
for
a
one
off
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
pour

a
big
lasting
foamy
white

poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
boulevard
tank
7
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
lighter
then
school
bus
yellow
with
a
massive
4
inch
cap
that
leaves
fingers
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
prevalent
from
the
pour
a
slightly
sulfuric
aroma
poured
crept
from
the
bottle
right
after
opening
it
just
the
way
i
like
it
damp
earth
lemon
zest
a
hint
of
ground
black
pepper
all
mixed
together
with
baled
hay
i
rather
exciting
nose
from
a
american
saison
it
has
my
hopes
up
unfortunately
the
flavor
let
them
down
rather
considerably
the
flavor
profile
seems
to
be
a
muddled
jumble
of
flavors
that
are
never
really
defined
individually
but
do
not
come
together
as
a
whole
either
up
front
is
the
all
to
sweet
mark
of
quite
a
bit
of
pale
malts
it
underlies
the
entirety
of
the
flavor
profile
milled
barley
slight
clove
white
pepper
and
just
a
bit
of
coriander
almost
no
citrus
or
grass
just
a
bit
of
wheat
tang
no
fruit
and
for
some
reason
the
after
flavor
really
bothers
me
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
flavor
but
it
irks
me
something
badly
the
mouthfeel
is
hands
down
the
hardest
aspect
to
nail
on
a
saison
and
this
one
misses
the
mark
medium
bodied
with
almost
a
creamy
aspect
not
really
dry
at
all
sugary
where
are
those
high
temperatures
they
were
talking
about
other
then
the
spices
i
really
dont
think
esters
play
that
much
of
a
role
in
the
anything
i
know
im
hard
on
saisons
they
are
my
favorite
style
and
i
really
do
love
gd
but
colette
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
light
body
and
easy
drinking
character
this
beer
goes
to
show
that
a
beer
with
a
higher
than
average
abv
can
still
be
great
for
enjoyment
after
a
hot
day
very
satisfied
with
this
purchase
d
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
clean
light
easy
driniking
and
refreshing
i
would
suggest
you
try
this
on
a
hot
day
d
it
finishes
like
a
pretty
good
saison
but
that
sweetness
up
front
was
distracting
im
sure
no
corn
was
used
but
that
is
the
word
i
would
associate
with
that
flavor
palate
is
nice
and
refreshing
sweet
pale
malt
that
is
reminiscent
of
corn
pops
light
tangy
citrsuy
flavors
from
the
saison
yeast
come
through
before
the
swallow
along
with
some
nice
lemony
hops
and
a
touch
of
coriander
finish
is
sweet
and
dry
body
is
light
and
effervescent
but
not
quite
as
light
as
a
true
belgian
saison
that
also
makes
it
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
other
saisons
on
the
market
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
what
a
nice
ale
for
the
warmer
weather
approaching
us
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
reviewed
on
05292010
id
definitely
recommend
this
beer
f
very
dry
with
hints
of
spicy
saison
flavors
little
boozy
warmth
and
tingle
a
little
heavy
booze
for
7
3
a
little
wheat
flavors
some
yeast
and
farmhouse
flavors
lingering
some
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
and
orange
peel
even
a
bit
of
spices
and
coriander
d
very
good
summer
saison
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
only
hindrance
is
the
high
carbonation
this
is
a
nicely
caronated
palate
with
sometexture
and
nuance
going
on
from
start
to
finish
this
dry
palate
would
be
somewhat
sessionable
on
a
summer
day
while
taking
a
break
from
some
hard
outdoor
work
not
a
style
i
often
seek
out
at
allon
a
warm
day
like
today
i
figured
it
might
hit
the
spot
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
hazed
lemonade
color
with
a
great
clingy
two
finger
white
head
that
left
broken
rings
of
lace
as
it
settled
slowly
funky
barnyard
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
some
ironmetallica
whiff
of
lemon
peel
as
wellsome
are
big
fans
of
the
barnyard
funkiam
not
flavors
are
funky
but
on
a
smaller
scalewet
grain
notes
along
with
lemon
pith
and
honeythere
is
enough
sweetness
to
keep
the
funk
in
check
for
me
a
decent
brewagain
not
a
fan
for
a
reasonbut
i
grade
it
accordingly
d
very
nice
drinkability
crisp
dry
well
suited
per
style
and
6
pack
worthy
an
easy
to
drink
interpretation
that
makes
for
a
good
tart
summertime
farmhouse
that
will
wet
the
whistle
and
make
fans
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
but
i
am
relatively
new
to
the
style
and
thought
it
was
enjoyable
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
saisons
in
the
future
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
the
perfect
early
summer
beer
just
makes
me
think
of
eating
a
good
meal
outside
and
kicking
back
a
few
with
friends
overall
a
great
saison
d
at
7
abv
this
isnt
something
you
can
drink
all
afternoon
i
wish
it
were
just
5
but
then
it
may
not
have
all
this
delicious
flavor
im
just
happy
theres
an
affordable
and
delicious
saison
in
sixpacks
great
divide
makes
great
beer
and
colette
is
further
proof

colette
is

theres
some
flaws
its
a
little
sugary
at
times
the
funkiness
could
be
turned
up
to
good
effect
and
the
beer
is
rather
lacking
esterwise
especially
considering
the
banana
present
in
the
aroma
but
absent
from
the
flavor
but
its
solid
and
refreshing
to
boot
its
a
good
saison
that
comes
in
a
6
pack
for
the
price
of
750ml
of
most
good
imported

excellent
value
i
was
very

for

some
of
the

i
associate
with
the

homebrew
styles
of
a
decade

or
today
but
that
is
the
time
period
i
associate
with
bananaclove
hysteria
i
would
have
pegged
it
as
spiced
hefeweizen
or
a
summer
beer
with
an
identity
crisis
hop
character
was
completely
supressed
under
the
spice
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
pint
even
at
7
5
but
there
is
much
better
to
be
had
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
apricot
farmhouse
from
upright
brewing
an
excellent
example
and
5
from
upright
a
classic
example
extremely
well
executed
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
to
exemplify
the
farmhousesaison
style
though
the
7
3
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
nothing
to
do
except
sample
some
brews
could
justify
a
round
im
not
getting
this
brew
again
the
whole
experience
was
awful
its
lemon
and
bitterness
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
it
was
very
poorly
executed
pours
a
hazed
yellow
gold
with
moderate
cap
of
soapy
white
bubbles
little
retention
scent
begins
with
equal
parts
tangy
wheat
and
floral
hops
light
vanilla
cookie
like
sweetness
with
a
splash
of
watery
fruit
and
lemongrass
on
the
finish
with
the
lightest
hint
of
herbs
taste
is
a
touch
more
aggressive
than
scent
dictated
but
still
well
balanced
with
strong
tangy
wheat
and
floral
notes
still
the
star
the
backbone
has
an
aggressive
shortbread
taste
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
as
well
as
watery
fruit
pears
combines
pleasantly
with
a
hop
profile
that
provides
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
and
earthy
spiciness
medium
bodied
and
dry
finish
a
nice
nonfunkdified
saison
which
keeps
things
dry
and
light
with
some
well
blended
flavors
pours
the
color
of
cloudy
spun
gold
capped
with
a
beautiful
rocky
white
head
this
one
looks
so
inviting
in
the
glass
aroma
of
strawberries
lemons
yeast
and
wheat
tastes
almost
exactly
like
it
smells
spicy
and
refreshing
with
a
good
hint
of
lemoncitrus
and
a
peppery
tang
on
the
back
end
the
alcohol
is
not
the
least
bit
evident
in
this
one
and
it
makes
for
a
delicious
and
refreshing
late
spring
afternoon
beer
excellent
overall
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
this
style
but
not
quite
on
the
level
of
the
best
belgian
originals
although
one
might
be
a
fool
to
expect
it
to
be
and
thus
this
beer
touches
greatness
overall
very
smooth
and
refreshing
but
more
like
a
spiced
wheat
beer
than
a
saison
however
very
drinkable
for
the
rather
high7
3abv
alcohol
content
a
nice
summer
sipper
drinkability
is
ok
but
when
i
reach
for
a
saison
i
doubt
its
this
one
one
plus
is
that
this
comes
in
6ers
though
the
thickness
of
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
what
docks
colette
points
is
the
sharpness
of
its
carbonation
it
isnt
particularly
bubbly
but
it
is
sharp
on
the
tongue
to
the
point
of
mild
uncomfortability
if
you
can
get
past
that
then
colette
is
a
supereasy
drinking
summer
beer
that
does
much
of
the
same
things
right
that
a
nice
hefe
would
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
though
i
cant
imagine
why
id
ever
want
to
get
this
as
opposed
to
the
real
mccoy
from
belgian
frankly
i
doubt
dupont
could
make
this
bland
and
uninteresting
a
saison
if
they
tried
i
like
this
i
like
it
more
in
the
bottle
for
some
reason
or
another
the
mix
of
yeasts
in
this
really
sets
it
off
this
is
one
american
saison
that
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
its
not
to
far
off
from
the
others
meaning
its
not
quite
on
the
belgian
scale
but
damn
its
close
i
know
its
not
sessionable
but
f
that
im
dranking
more
got
this
as
part
of
a
variety
pack
and
decided
to
drink
this
first
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
as
i
didnt
really
expect
to
enjoy
this
style
as
this
is
my
first
saison
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
pours
a
bright
but
somewhat
hazy
straw
color
scent
was
somewhat
faint
but
what
was
there
was
wheaty
and
citrusy
flavor
was
complex
with
a
mild
lemony
sourness
and
lots
of
grain
feels
like
you
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
but
the
alcohol
catches
up
quick
glad
i
stumbled
across
this
and
definitely
will
be
exploring
this
style
some
more
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
the
aroma
isnt
a
strong
point
with
not
much
going
on
other
than
some
funky
yeastiness
and
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
from
the
aroma
with
a
biscuity
malt
presence
upfront
followed
by
some
lemon
and
mineraly
hops
some
barnyard
funkiness
some
spicyness
white
peppercorn
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
decent
saison
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
food
pairings
i
could
enjoy
it
with
a
funky
cheese
and
crackers
as
a
summer
afternoon
snack
or
perhaps
lemon
pepper
shrimp
salad
d
it
is
the
first
hot
day
of
the
year
here
in
florida
and
damn
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
i
see
previous
reviewers
are
less
impressed
i
am
not
sure
what
to
chalk
that
up
to
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
tart
malt
strong
yeast
and
slight
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
tart
malt
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
slight
hop
and
slight
clove
overall
a
decent
body
and
blend
notes
its
a
nice
brew
but
it
has
a
feeling
like
it
wants
to
get
there
but
it
cant
really
make
it
its
a
long
way
from
being
a
noticeable
farmhouse
ale
and
surely
this
might
be
the
least
remarkable
offering
ive
tried
from
great
divide
overall
decent
effort
by
great
divide
but
nothing
really
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
accustomed
to
drinking
good
representations
of
the
style
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
large
head
with
medium
to
light
lacing
the
nose
gives
way
to
horse
blanket
barnyard
yeast
sour
presence
and
no
alcohol
to
note
the
palate
is
stronger
than
the
nose
with
lots
of
barnyard
tart
sourness
light
to
medium
fruit
and
and
a
nice
dry
medium
bitter
finish
i
rated
this
beer
as
a
session
beer
it
hides
the
7
3
all
day
bold
flavors
and
a
crisp
finish
with
a
hint
of
complexity
makes
this
beer
a
true
or
ideal
session
beer
and
a
work
horse
in
the
beer
world
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
story
that
it
told
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
high
solid
not
mind
blowing
but
worth
trying
at
this
price
and
availability
overall
impression
i
would
smack
lips
with
colette
anytime
not
tops
for
the
style
but
it
is
worth
a
taste
if
you
have
the
greenback
mouthdrink
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
but
still
feels
nice
drinkablity
is
high
with
all
the
flavor
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
d
i
respect
this
brew
its
hearty
it
does
what
its
supposed
to
and
it
is
what
it
is
it
is
missing
something
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
but
its
wellcrafted
and
kind
of
exciting
tasting
it
kicks
more
than
i
thought
it
would
i
would
probably
get
this
one
again
with
the
release
of
saison
farmhouse
ale
great
divide
has
proven
once
again
that
they
are
one
of
the
worlds
finest
craft
breweries

top10
these
guys
are

my
top3
bottom
line
this
is
delicious
drinkable
beer
on
hot
summer
days
cold
winter
nights
and
everything
in
between
pours
a
clearly
hazed
bright
yellow
golden
hue
with
a
large
white
tiny
bubbled
foamy
white
head
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
on

of
my

this
one
says
it
was
bottled
in
april
2009
thats
fine
with
me
a
style
that
probably
does
okay
with
a
little
age
aroma
has
a
nice
yeast
spiciness
label
states
that
they
used
a
blend
of
4
yeast
strains
im
definitely
getting
some
saison
dupont
characteristics
with
a
citrustropical
fruitiness
sharp
wheat
edge
with
a
nice
spiced
backend
ample
sweetness
a
touch
of
biscuit
drizzled
with
honey
that
herbal
spice
component
is
intresting
almost
lavender
with
a
touch
of
black
pepper
flavor
is
dominant
with
the
spices
but
bursts
of
honey
biscuit
malt
and
tropical
fruit
pineapple
blend
nicely
with
the
spiced
herbal
additions
yeast
gives
it
that
funky
peppery
slightly
nutty
edge
that
overall
works
well
together
a
perfect
beer
to
combine
with
most
foods
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
with
tart
and
sweet
sensation
over
the
palate
dry
yeasty
finish
moderate
alcohol
medium
bodied
carbonation
carries
this
one
quite
well
not
really
cloying
to
me
at
all
drinkability
is
solid
all
around
very
nice
american
brewed
version
sometimes
this
style
can
be
pretty
bad
if
not
drinking
a
version
outta
of
belgium
great
divide
pulled
it
off
very
well
and
they
put
their
own
trademarks
on
it
drinkability
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
think
when
going
into
this
beer
im
finding
it
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
very
drinkable
for
a
7
3
beer
d
this
is
an
excellent
and
very
drinkable
saison
the
yeast
character
is
wonderful
with
the
strong
tropical
fruit
presence
that
i
look
for
in
a
saison
as
well
as
some
some
clove
and
other
spices
to
add
depth
the
hop
character
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
yeast
but
it
still
noticeable
especially
in
the
aroma
and
more
than
capable
of
balancing
the
malt
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
if
given
the
opportunity
good
refreshing
brew
this
is
the
second
great
divide
beer
in
a
row
that
really
hasnt
dazzled
me
after
rolling
out
consistently
great
beer
this
and
the
15th
anniversary
release
are
just
in
the
pretty
good
category
this
one
would
probably
be
improved
if
the
herbal
aspect
was
toned
down
a
little
the
other
flavors
seem
to
work
nicely
and
i
like
the
hoppy
aspect
of
it
but
that
vegetal
bit
is
just
too
strong
not
a
bad
effort
but
a
little
disappointing
worth
a
try
nonetheless
d
well
im
used
to
great
divide
putting
out
awesome
dipas
barleywines
and
imperial
stouts
who
knew
they
had
this
kind
of
range
in
all
honesty
i
wasnt
expecting
much
as
i
said
when
i
want
a
dipa
barleywine
or
imperial
stout
i
know
full
well
to
look
to
these
guys
but
i
only
picked
this
up
out
of
curiosity
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
fully
americanized
saison
the
kind
my
local
brewery
brews
and
tries
to
pass
off
as
a
saison
when
it
just
tastes
like
a
slightly
stronger
witbier
clearly
i
was
wrong
this
is
the
real
thing
crisp
refreshing
drinkable
and
fairly
authentic
this
ale
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
very
light
haze
and
develops
a
full
2inch
head
that
is
totally
white
and
creamy
the
head
settles
over
time
into
about
14
inch
the
carbonation
is
marked
but
of
moderate
intensity
with
very
small
bubbles
the
initial
nose
makes
me
think
of
a
pilsner
but
the
malty
and
hoppy
notes
are
pushed
aside
by
the
expected
sour
notes
of
this
farmhouse
ale
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
pleasant
lightlysour
lingering
definitely
an
ale
for
food
the
sour
notes
are
more
restrained
than
i
expected
of
a
farmhouse
alesaison
the
ale
is
quite
tasty
lacing
does
form
but
is
rather
moderate
the
7
3
abv
is
not
noticeable
on
the
palate
id
try
this
again
but
would
first
return
to
some
saisons
from
belgium
d
i
really
liked
this
and
could
easily
have
a
few
the
crispness
gives
a
refreshing
feel
that
makes
it
easy
to
keep
drinking
it
overall
its
a
good
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
saison
i
love
great
divide
beers
and
i
love
this
style
so
lets
try
this
one
pours
a
sort
of
dull
golden
straw
color
with
just
a
ring
of
white
lacing
some
fruit
smell
in
the
nose
along
with
some
some
nice
bright
grain
green
apples
first
come
to
mind
in
the
taste
with
some
pineapple
and
champagne
tastes
as
well
body
is
light
for
a
somewhat
high
abv
drinkability
is
very
nice
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
put
back
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
from
great
divide
i
may
have
been
expecting
a
bit
more
but
still
a
very
fair
effort
cheers
not
worth
buying
again
but
a
good
experience
nice
beer
but
one
of
the
few
great
divides
that
i
think
pales
in
comparisson
to
other
breweries
similar
offerings
d
smooth
and
enjoyable
may
not
be
as
memorable
as
some
european
counterparts
but
it
is
tasty
overall
pretty
standard
but
worth
a
shot
pours
bright
yellow
pretty
big
foamy
head
smells
a
bit
barnyardy
but
also
a
bit
cirtusy
almost
like
an
amalgam
of
what
you
get
with
oldschool
and
newschool
saisons
taste
is
basic
saisonfaire
a
bit
dry
but
still
kind
of
sweet
some
woody
fruity
citric
flavors
and
a
distinct
lack
of
hoppy
bitterness
little
bit
of
an
ascetic
kick
decently
coating
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
for
a
sessionable
uncomplicated
saison
this
is
pretty
good
taste
is
crisp
yet
thick
somewhat
tangy
sweet
fruit
banana
and
sour
malt
ends
oily
and
slightly
bitter
d
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
strong
as
it
is
a
good
beer
for
those
warmer
days
if
youre
a
fan
of
beer
with
some
subtle
citrus
zest
i
was
unimpressed
with
the
appearance
and
came
off
a
bit
rough
but
ended
up
enjoying
it
none
the
less
for
its
taste
falls
well
into
the
saison
spectrum
although
less
refined
drinks
slow
unpleasing
mix
of
flavors
abv
is
well
hidden
im
not
really
too
enamored
of
any
of
gds
belgian
styled
offerings
this
one
just
struck
the
wrong
way
almost
drain
poured
it
final
note
a
good
beer
but
misses
with
nose
and
appearance
otherwise
it
would
be
a
damn
fine
beer
d
good
drinkability
it
a
solid
beer
i
like
this
one
a
lot
but
it
simply
needs
a
lot
more
funkiness
to
compete
with
the
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
this
one
needs
to
be
tweaked
too
much
of
a
hop
presence
an
excellent
offering
by
great
divide
22oz
bottle
bottled
on
41509
bottle
conditioned
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
pretty
pale
straw
with
two
fingers
of
puffy
white
head
wheaty
spice
in
the
aroma
with
some
lemon
also
a
bit
of
sugar
as
it
warmed
slight
hop
flavor
also
some
yeasty
funk
fairly
complex
flavors
light
bodied
dry
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
this
d
perhaps
this
brew
needs
a
little
more
age
to
tone
down
the
hop
profile
but
it
just
wasnt
the
most
balanced
saison
ive
come
across
enjoyable
to
be
sure
and
a
pleasing
summer
evening
sipper
the
nose
really
is
remarkably
good
though
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
gently
zesty
with
a
finebubbled
carbonation
that
gently
bristles
the
tongue
its
refreshing
and
fits
perfectly
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
d
sure
its
not
the
most
dynamic
saison
out
there
but
it
does
what
it
is
supposed
to
it
makes
you
refreshed
on
a
hot
day
cant
bitch
about
that
sure
the
look
flavor
and
feel
could
use
a
bit
of
work
but
the
beer
works
its
not
the
best
saison
out
there
by
any
means
but
it
works
in
a
pinch
and
makes
me
happy
i
am
not
upset
by
this
beer
at
all
maybe
just
a
touch
let
down
i
figure
that
great
divide
will
play
with
this
brew
and
tweak
it
a
bit
as
they
are
known
to
do
i
see
it
as
a
work
in
progress
and
i
expect
it
to
get
better
the
more
they
brew
it
md
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
actually
not
too
prickly
drinkability
is
decent
overall
a
decent
saison
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
in
a
saison
it
has
everything
youd
think
youd
find
in
a
saison
it
just
needs
some
more
balance
cheers
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
got
a
way
to
go
before
its
anything
more
than
that
id
like
to
see
gd
tweak
their
new
beers
and
get
them
on
the
level
with
old
ruffian
and
oa
yeti
d
this
is
a
good
american
example
of
a
saison
very
light
and
drinkable
a
good
summer
beer
many
thanks
to
erik
from
flying
saucer
for
the
hookup
22oz
bomber
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
lemon
peel
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
fruit
crisp
spice
and
yeast
funk
that
leaves
a
tart
sour
finish
the
beer
is
just
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
the
style
calls
for
the
tartness
is
a
little
on
the
astringent
side
however
this
is
an
enjoyable
saison
just
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
coming
from
great
divide
oh
well
it
is
still
enjoyable
overall
impression
highly
drinkable
and
a
nice
offering
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
in
six
packs
one
bottle
is
enough
to
satisfy
a
hankering
for
a
saison
wouldnt
make
a
session
out
of
this
beer
but
its
a
drinkable
beer
650
mls
is
enough
this
saison
is
brewed
with
barley
wheat
and
rice
using
4
unique
yeast
strains
and
fermented
at
a
higher
temp
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
body
the
aroma
is
light
lemon
and
earth
the
flavor
is
hay
lemon
grassy
bracing
hop
bitterness
spicy
yeast
and
a
light
tartness
light
grainy
body
with
crisp
carbonation
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasing
but
unremarkable
beer
gd
has
spoiled
us
with
so
many
outstanding
beers
over
the
years
i
was
expecting
something
truly
remarkable
here
perhaps
that
expectation
was
unfair
but
this
beer
feels
like
a
letdown
not
really
impressed
by
this
offering
some
what
adjunctish
flavor
and
aromas
just
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
sweet
side
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
taste
and
nose
are
quite
sweet
with
a
subtle
belgian
yeast
and
floral
hop
presence
some
fruity
spices
medium
body
is
overly
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
which
of
course
allows
for
a
wide
range
of
interpretation
allowing
for
the
unique
character
few
d
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
decent
a
greater
level
of
complexity
out
front
would
have
been
nice
the
sourness
of
the
finish
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
im
still
glad
i
tried
it
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
but
not
too
interesting
for
a
saison
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
sweet
sugary
fruits
dont
jive
well
with
the
yeast
funk
great
divide
churned
out
a
turd
in
my
opinion
its
funny
how
they
can
make
grand
slam
beers
like
yeti
and
titan
but
make
average
beers
like
this
and
samurai
i
still
love
great
divide
but
would
have
appreciated
more
effort
or
originality
in
this
summer
brew
drinkability
a
fairly
enjoyable
pleasantly
drinkable
saison
given
a
slight
american
twist
worth
a
try
consumed
may

2009
the
body
finishes
a
bit
dry
this
is
enhanced
by
a
high
carbonation
with
a
slight
carbonic
bite
light
but
noticeable
overall
there
are
some
good
positives
here
specifically
with
the
yeast
but
some
negative
with
the
rubbery
flavors
and
the
lack
of
more
yeast
still
drinkable
though
d
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
and
another
great
beer
from
great
divide
bottled
april
15
very
decent
new
saison
from
great
divide
a
style
i
like
very
much
and
what
i
find
is
a
great
hot
weather
beer
different
from
all
of
the
wheat
beers
out
there
this
time
of
year
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
fairly
nice
pur
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
nice
fruity
nose
of
bananas
a
touch
of
lemon
straw
and
some
coriander
alittle
citrsuy
in
the
taste
as
well
especially
up
front
with
some
sweet
banana
and
light
grain
and
spice
in
the
finish
the
tiniest
bit
sour
and
very
clean
in
the
mouth
a
relatively
simple
but
tasty
saison
it
is
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
the
nice
citrus
finish
helps
make
it
very
refreshing
balanced
and
keeps
it
interesting
from
the
day
great
divide
tapped
the
saison
ive
had
23
a
week
its
a
great
beer
thats
fun
to
drink
and
its
refreshing
enough
that
i
like
having
more
than
one
in
a
row
its
got
a
little
citrus
sour
taste
to
it
with
some
great
carbonation
and
a
beautiful
color
overall
a
great
beer
d
all
in
all
the
flavors
of
this
beer
carry
its
drinkability
its
mouthfeel
definitely
needs
some
work
the
dominate
yeast
flavors
the
label
claims
to
have
used
a
special
blend
of
four
yeasts
really
give
you
the
impression
of
a
witbier
of
some
sort
i
wouldnt
call
this
beer
true
to
style
by
a
longshot
however
it
is
a
decent
beer
go
in
without
expectations
and
you
might
just
like
it
as
for
me
9
bones
can
get
me
a
beer
much
closer
to
style
d
very
high
would
get
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
if
i
was
looking
for
a
straight
up
saison
i
would
turn
to
dupont
of
hennepin
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
great
saison
maybe
it
just
needs
more
time
in
the
bottle
however
its
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
at
this
price
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
notes
from
and
tasted
on
43009
22oz
bottle
7
with
a
cool
label
that
has
a
yellow
checkered
theme
that
reminds
me
of
dupont
thick
white
head
and
a
super
cloudy
whitish
yellow
color
the
smell
is
just
slightly
funky
dusty
earthy
smells
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
the
taste
is
quite
refreshing
or
at
least
it
makes
me
think
i
have
been
refreshed
its
been
a
long
week
nice
yeasty
spicy
flavor
and
goes
down
very
smooth
excellent
saison
clean
dry
finish
has
an
earthy
fruit
nose
with
a
hint
of
fresh
laundry
and
faint
barnyard
it

a
very
pillowy
very
uniformly
and
finely
bubbled
2
offwhite

light

the
yeast
driven

light
malt
provides
the
backbone
with
light
fruits
peach
apricot
light
tropical
not
quite
pineapple
maybe
guava
medium
body
and
average
to
a
little
above
on
the
carbonation
overall
not
crazy
about
this
one
but
i
am
glad
i
had
an
opportunity
to
try
it
so
i
know
in
the
future
to
pass
on
this
one
it
was
on
sale
by
the
way
so
it
doesnt
break
my
heart
that
it
isnt
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
had
its
fair
and
that
is
about
it
o
excellent
saison
delicious
o
a
very
good
saison
that
hides
its
8
5
abv
well
i
wish
it
was
a
little
bit
more
funky
but
the
fruity
citrus
flavors
are
also
very
nice
i
prefer
boulevards
saison
brett
but
it
would
be
nice
to
try
them
side
by
side
yummy
seek
it
out
for
a
different
experience
and
have
an
open
mind
oh
and
this
hides
the
8
5
so
watch
out
excellent
farmhouse
flavor
with
some
wild
yeast
on
the
end
really
great
beer
would
love
to
see
how
this
matures
with
some
cellaring
dry
and
sweet
muddled
citrus
flavors
with
belgian
yeast
all
spice
didnt
quite
hit
the
mark
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
it
forms
a
generous
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
as
it
dissipates
the
color
is
a
nice
red
gold
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
spice
from
the
rye
with
a
slight
saison
funk
very
nice

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
even
without
the
classic
saison
funk
very
tasty
and
impressive
o
overall
a
nice
saison
with
a
few
nice
nuances
that
differentiate
it
from
other
saisons
out
there
pretty
easy
drinking
and
a
nice
one
to
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
sure
onot
bad
there
are
certainly
better
saisons
out
there
but
you
could
do
a
hell
of
a
lot
worse
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
good
example
of
the
style
its
still
identifiable
as
a
saison
and
the
brett
and
rye
seem
to
be
in
the
background
thats
not
bad
but
i
found
myself
wishing
that
the
rye
and
brett
were
more
noticeable
and
the
belgian
yeast
showed
up
in
the
background
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
very
crisp
pretty
prickly
very
dry
on
the
finish
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
glass
is
enough
for
me
any
more
than
that
and
the
prickly
carbonation
might
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
any
aspect
that
stood
out
as
being
better
than
the
others
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
brett
and
rye
didnt
show
up
more
they
were
a
little
light
for
my
liking
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
it
isnt
anything
im
going
to
stock
up
on
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
saisons
with
just
a
little
brett
to
them
the
brett
doesnt
really
take
out
of
the
realm
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
saison
but
with
that
being
said
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
it
and
i
dont
think
its
very
memorable
this
beer
made
for
a
nice
first
impression
for
the
bruery
and
im
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
beers
and
i
would
say
its
above
the
middle
as
far
as
saisons
go
good
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
saison
keep
up
the
solid
work
tasty
but
i
wish
it
had
more
body
was
more
beerlike
kind
of
like
a
tart
sour
alcoholic
fruit
juice
o
this
was
my
first
experience
with
the
bruery
and
iam
definetly
impressed
a
different
take
on
a
saison
that
is
extremely
drinkable
and
well
executed
o
tasty
and
complex
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
that
is
a
bit
towards
the
sour
side
750
ml
bottle
tastes
of
apples
and
pears
with
a
touch
of
grapefruit
very
sweet
was
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
not
something
i
would
buy
again
ok
but
not
great
i
got
a
bottle
at
garaje
in
sf
on
a
hot
day
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
until
i
tried
this
one
it
sure
blows
away
goose
island
where
do
they
hide
all
that
alcohol
anyway
one
of
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
overall
an
awesome
and
readily
accessible
saison
nice
overall
for
my
first
offering
from
the
bruery
this
is
a
well
executed
saison
with
the
belgian
yeast
taking
centre
stage
with
the
other
ingredients
acting
as
good
supporting
members
i
find
it
to
be
a
little
sweet
and
would
like
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
drier
finish
o
with
a
combination
of
muddled
and
standard
flavors
this
beer
let
me
down
in
a
stunning
fashion
while
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
saison
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
the
bruery
maybe
some
sour
characters
lower
abv
for
clearer
flavors
or
a
little
wider
array
of
flavors
im
all
for
subtlety
but
funk
is
a
flavor
that
can
wear
on
me
pretty
quickly
great
beer
worthy
of
storing
in
your
beer
fridge
repeatable
this
pours
with
a
dense
cloud
of
bright
foam
and
a
iridescent
yellow
color
the
nose
holds
a
tinge
of
alcohol
before
yielding
black
licorice
pears
peppercorns
and
cantaloupe
i
taste
apricots
at
first
before
a
glimpse
of
sweet
lemon
moves
in
the
middle
palate
is
yeasty
with
some
malt
before
it
ends
with
banana
and
raisin
bread
very
good
example
of
the
style
with
a
more
narrow
complexity
described
as
a
belgian
style
ale
brewed
with
rye
and
brettanomyces
this
beer
pours
brightly
golden
with
a
copper
hue
it
is
highly
effervescent
with
a
sturdy
white
head
that
persists
as
a
thick
layer
of
merenguelike
foam
throughout
delicate
belgian
lacing
rides
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
musty
with
hints
of
banana
clove
and
spice
malt
is
present
and
phenolic
notes
linger
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
big
and
fruity
and
quickly
fades
into
a
crisp
dry
finish
that
leaves
a
dank
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
slightly
astringent
overall
this
beer
is
a
solid
representation
of
style
that
has
a
crisp
character
and
sweetness
that
is
balanced
by
barnyard
funk
crisp
thin
head
with
minimal
lacing
patterns
aroma
of
fresh
grass
and
stone
fruit
notably
apricot
plum
and
peach
citrus
notes
of
light
lemon
zest
grapefruit
and
tangerine
with
a
fair
amount
of
mango
especially
in
the
aftertaste
very
light
body
with
a
lasting
aftertaste
of
citrus
and
hops
this
is
the
first
beer
from
the
bruery
and
it
was
fantastic
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
lighter
foods
for
sure
i
like
a
lot
of
things
about
this
brewery
from
their
philosophy
we
wont
brew
an
ipa
to
their
label
art
looking
forward
to
trying
many
more
from
them
this
will
be
a
new
favorite
of
mine
for
this
style
it
has
everything
i
like
funk
and
sweetness
balanced
by
hops
and
crispness
o
my
favorite
sour
that
doest
start
with
cantillon
this
failed
to
impress
me
the
mouthfeel
is
oddly
thick
for
a
saison
due
to
the
rye
and
the
sticky
flavor
is
underwhelming
without
a
significantly
tart
aftertaste
typical
of
many
brett
saisons
ive
made
better
beers
than
this
im
left
thinking
that
the
bruery
should
price
their
beers
differently
based
on
the
end
result
not
the
cost
of
production
this
one
should
have
been
on
closeout
while
their
better
offerings
could
fetch
more
o
a
very
refreshing
unfiltered
summer
saison
the
bruery
hasnt
disappointed
so
far
glad
i
bought
2
of
these
hope
this
gets
even
better
after
another
year
of
cellaring
prost
what
a
treat
drink
it
o
excellent
beer
certainly
heavier
than
belgian
saisons
ive
had
at
least
in
alcohol
weight
reminiscent
of
biere
brut
in
in
some
ways
but
playful
and
tame
all
at
the
same
time
overall
my
goodness
for
less
than
10
i
got
a
steal
i
want
more
o
interesting
beer
you
can
tell
this
is
a
well
done
saison
but
with
the
addition
of
the
rye
gives
it
a
nice
twist
all
the
funk
you
should
expect
is
there
along
with
the
spiciness
of
rye
really
neat
beer
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
boy
is
there
a
lot
going
on
flavor
wise
there
are
many
different
tastes
mixing
together
and
mixing
well
i
hope
to
get
another
to
age
and
see
how
these
flavors
develop
together
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
very
different
from
the
first
time
i
tried
it
though
it
seems
all
of
the
flavors
have
mellowed
out
and
blended
together
although
i
can
smell
it
i
cant
taste
any
sort
of
fruit
it
also
hasnt
developed
any
foul
tastes
which
is
good
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
and
aging
a
few
bottles
as
it
suggests
on
the
label
is
well
worth
it
overall
a
good
saison
perfect
for
the
hot
day
im
reviewing
it
overall
a
very
solid
spring
beer
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
nicely
balanced
and
very
tasty
worth
the
pricetag
overall
the
beer
is
well
made
sports
a
good
amount
of
flavors
and
drinks
pretty
easily
i
would
of
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
better
attenuated
as
the
sweetness
plays
off
the
fall
spice
flavors
a
bit
much
though
i
do
believe
this
was
brewed
for
the
fall
time
either
way
a
few
tweaks
would
be
called
for
to
rate
this
higher
but
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
one
of
the
more
pleasing
saisons
ive
had
lot
of
earthy
lemony
aromas
bubblegum
big
grain
note
the
rye
comes
through
on
the
flavor
too
lot
of
lemony
citrus
and
some
tart
rasperry
notes
really
well
balanced
interesting
pretty
rich
when
fresh
have
heard
this
sits
well
for
a
year
or
so
this
is
an
outstanding
saisoncomplex
and
tasty
overall
im
enjoying
this
beer
lots
of
complex
flavors
in
this
that
all
meld
together
to
create
something
better
worth
a
try
o
im
not
a
fan
of
clove
so
this
didnt
work
for
me
also
this
isnt
a
very
good
saison
offering
i
found
myself
wanting
a
lost
abbey
saison
over
this
one
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
great
blend
of
yeast
spices
and
dry
fruit
flavors
the
subtle
rye
and
brett
add
a
nice
kick
overall
well
done
a
subtle
but
rich
take
o
a
great
big
saison
with
brett
working
to
compliment
the
flavours
instead
of
dominating
them
will
be
buying
again
prost
o
made
for
drinking
with
old
friends
at
the
underthetent
dance
on
homecoming
weekend
for
its
purported
if
not
particularly
evident
abv
this
is
a
tasty
easydrinking
stroll
down
saison
street
one
bulked
up
with
the
various
malt
inputs
giving
it
a
much
heavier
feel
than
the
norm
at
any
rate
the
brett
is
faint
at
best
the
rye
much
more
prominent
pushing
this
into
new
or
substyle
territory
if
you
care
about
that
kind
of
stuff
me
im
gonna
go
and
just
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
bountiful
bottle
light
brown
in
color
with
vibrant
carbonation
in
fact
when
i
popped
the
cap
foam
started
to
rise
out
of
the
bottle
shortly
thereafter
and
it
had
not
been
disturbed
prior
to
that
good
clarity
thin
layer
of
tightly
knitminuscule
white
foam
on
top
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
and
unique
the
tartness
of
brett
blends
very
well
with
the
spiciness
of
rye
the
flavor
dimples
carries
the
aroma
forward
the
brett
dominates
but
leaves
room
for
the
playful
spiciness
of
the
rye
mouth
is
pretty
carbonatedtrue
to
style
and
with
all
of
those
clues
prior
to
tasting
it
was
no
surprise
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
lively
and
cream
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
the
beer
itself
is
a
fascinating
color
instead
of
the
traditional
pale
gold
or
straw
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
and
obscure
dark
orange
with
hints
of
brown
the
beer
smell
is
divine
and
unique
the
brettanomyces
and
rye
mix
very
well
together
along
with
the
earthy
hop
notes
the
bretta
provides
a
nice
sweet
fruity
smell
to
offset
the
earthiness
and
the
rye
the
beer
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
stronger
and
earthy
hop
notes
that
mixes
well
with
the
rye
the
bretta
takes
off
some
of
the
edge
and
provides
a
nice
nectarlike
taste
to
the
brew
the
beer
feel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
biting
carbonation
but
feels
a
little
thick
for
a
saison
overall
a
superb
brew
that
i
will
get
again
first
things
first
i
thought
i
had
drunk
this
before
but
the
no
review
has
left
me
guessing
so
lets
just
review
it
for
future
reference
and
it
pours
a
hazed
golden
orange
hue
with
a
creamy
ever
present
three
finger
head
and
lacing
as
far
as
the
eye
can
seethe

mouthfeel
is

with

with

of
bitter
hops
and
spicy
rye
and
overall
definately
something
quite
quaffable
even
given
its
high
abv
cheers
flavor
is
definitely
rustic
caramel
malt
is
very
present
with
a
nice
helping
of
wheat
and
fruity
noble
hop
its
a
very
malty
saison
and
the
rye
definitely
gives
it
a
nice
kick
of
spice
id
imagine
classic
rustic
saisons
from
old
world
belgium
had
lots
of
rye
and
whatever
else
they
can
grab
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
damn
near
perfect
super
dry
and
a
perfect
body
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
its
nearly
9
and
you
can
tell
it
has
a
kick
but
its
not
overdone
really
a
great
saison
really
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
delicious
to
boot
o
the
nice
well
blended
flavor
has
some
peppery
and
fruit
yeast
characters
which
add
a
nice
depth
and
it
is
very
easy
to
finish
the
bottle
the
price
is
a
bit
high
compared
to
other
with
similar
character
but
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
beautiful
beer
a
delicious
alcoholic
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
sparking
white
wine
some
subtle
malt
and
yeast
characteristics
noted
in
the
aroma
as
well
but
it
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
smell
of
fruity
alcohol
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
absolutely
amazing
there
is
some
straw
like
malt
presence
but
i
was
really
blown
away
by
the
unmistakable
fruity
characteristics
of
this
beer
this
is
really
something
else
a
lot
of
very
interesting
things
are
going
on
in
this
brew
that
i
cannot
even
explain
this
is
more
of
a
fine
wine
than
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
perfect
nice
and
dry
fuck
miller
high
life
this
shit
is
the
real
champagne
of
beers
overall
not
bad
but
failed
to
leave
a
significant
impression
worth
trying
and
and
real
fans
of
light
belgian
ales
will
be
very
pleased
this
is
not
a
great
example
of
a
saison
it
it
fairly
bland
and
bitter
the
alcohol
is
very
prevalent
and
the
taste
is
pretty
raw
after
drinking
a
good
portion
it
smooths

it

mouthfeel
is
thick

fluffy
overall
this
seems
like
a
really
solid
saison
with
an
interesting
little
spicy
twist
from
the
rye
o
this
one
has
a
really
interesting
but
rather
intense
flavor
that
makes
it
a
sipping
beer
even
though
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
nicely
constructed
with
the
brett
being
a
more
subtle
contributor
to
the
flavoraroma
rather
than
dominating
this
was
definitely
a
surprise
to
look
at
but
it
drank
deliciously
it
had
a
dry
and
earthy
yeast
that
took
a
back
seat
to
all
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
and
malt
there
was
a
faint
woody
quality
that
i
thought
was
very
pleasant
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
drink
but
nothing
too
overdone
the

sour

were

trip

we

its

it

solid

up

still

the

is

with
some
strong

there
is
also

a

and

the

go
very
well

and
a

the
light

notes
work
very
well

add
to
the
beers
drinkability
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
still
love
you
cigar
city
do
although
fruity
the
guava
component
is
far
surpassed
in
degree
of
influence
by
the
characterful
but
confused
yeast
and
other
fermenters
it
comes
across
as
the
sort
of
sour
that
makes
one
wonder
if
they
meant
for
this
to
happen
challenging
even
in
small
doses
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
working
all
the
way
though
a
pubstyle
serving
of
this
misguided
beer
overall
a
great
saison
that
id
buy
again
but
not
sure
i
would
trade
for
it
o
i
thought
the
fruit
was
incorporated
pretty
nicely
into
the
beer
adding
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
and
complexity
to
the
saison
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day
o
i
have
only
had
a
few
cigar
city
beers
and
i
have
been
impressed
so
perhaps
i
expected
too
much
but
i
was
kinda
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
but
i
was
expecting
great
it
does
have
a
disnctive
yeast
flavor
with
a
solid
guava
presence
but
nothing
really
super
special
flavor
for
me
i
like
it
but
perhaps
i
expect
too
much
worth
a
try
for
sure
though
that
being
said
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
back
oa

get
a

this
i

for
this
one

like

and
i
like

things
i
also
like

so
this
is
a
winwinwin
right
well
perhaps
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
godly
expectations
but
it
was
still
a
damn
good
beer
i
enjoyed
the
saison
and
funk
flavors
that
come
through
and
pound
hard
from
middle
to
end
but
my
main
complaint
is
that
the
guava
and
fruit
in
general
was
too
muted
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
still

for

overall
wow
really
good
stuff
i
was
expecting
this
to
taste

and
way
too
fruity
its
a

saison
with
only
subtle
hints
of
fruit

i

over

whatever

had
left

for

i
guess
its
out
of
season
but
it
still
tastes
fantastic
this
is
a
strongly
spiced
saison
which
is
quite
enjoyable
but
the
clove
yeast
phenols
dominate
and
i
would
prefer
more
of
the
guava
flavor
to
come
through
edit
after
a
glass
i
have
strong
guava
undertones
that
just
linger
on
the
palate
very
interesting
brew
im
really
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
my
experience
did
not
match
what
i
was
expecting
worth
a
try
if
its
in
front
of
you
but
nothing
to
seek
o
this
is
dammed
tasty
a
little
tweaking
of
the
carbonation
and
this
would
enter
into
a
world
class
level
beverage
i
found
this
beer
to
very
refreshing
certainly
something
that
could
be
nice
all
year
round
as
i
stated
earlier
i
didnt
really
dig
the
smell
and
tended
to
avoid
taking
a
sniff
while
tipping
it
back
theres
nothing
overly
remarkable
about
the
taste
but
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
good
in
that
regard
not
sure
its
something
i
would
make
a
point
of
picking
up
again
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
either
o
not
exactly
sure
what
the
ho
hum
is
about
it
was
a
light
gusher
when
it
opened
and
i
picked
up
the
medicinal
plastic
then
the
taste
has
yet
to
south
as
far
as
i
know
i
only
tasted
a
little
plastic
behind
the
scenes
o
an
interesting
saison
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
guava
but
this
beer
seems
to
capture
it
pretty
well
this
is
a
really
unique
tasty
beer
o
this
is
a
really
solid
saison
with
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
i
enjoyed
the
way
the
fruit
is
utilized
without
an
attempt
to
mask
the
proper
style
of
beer
o
nice
beer
although
a
bit
different
than
i
expected
a
solid
saison
although
i
wish
the
abv
were
a
little
lower
o
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
tried
would
drink
weekly
recommended
o
sweet
and
tropical
drinks
easy
overall
as
with
the
cucumber
saison
i
tried
recently
i
found
that
the
concept
was
more
interesting
than
the
end
product
just
too
much
going
on
and
it
never
comes
together
in
an
appealing
way
for
me
overall
a
real
nice
beer
tartness
is
just
right
for
a
saison
and
the
taste
overall
is
nicely
complex

the
body
was
a

livelier

nothing
else
to
complain
about

guava
made

put
in

the
guava
was

was

enough
for

of

i

and
and
provides
for
a
refreshing
finish
that
leaves
medium
fruit
on
the
dryish
pallet
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
did
not
want
to
come
to
an
end
o
very
pleasing
to
my
palette
all
the
funkness
of
a
saison
but
nice
sour
like
qualities
a
solid
saison
by
any
means
i
like
the
bit
of
tropical
fruitiness
in
this
one
this
style
can
get
spicy
and
very
dry
and
this
one
is
less
so
still
dry
clean
finish
with
a
medium
body
and
great
carbonation
i
definitely
liked
this
one
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
lots
of
head
aroma
coming
off
the
top
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
guava
coming
through
but
otherwise
your
standard
funky
farmhouse
smell
yeast
fruit
earthy
funk
taste
is
unique
with
a
perfect
amount
of
guava
coming
through
the
carbonation
and
yeast
funk
that
dominates
the
palate
hint
of
crisp
hops
at
the
end
a
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
excellent
any
time
but
especially
in
the
summer
pretty
high
on
my
list
of
saisons
im
not
sure
if
theyre
going
to
stick
with
the
sour
version
from
now
on
but
i
liked
this
significantly
better
than
the
soured
gg
o
3
75
this
is
a
fine
saison
and
pleasant
to
drink
but
for
something
ostensibly
built
around
guava
it
seems
to
miss
the
mark
its
just
a
nice
saison
the
numbypowdery
mouthfeel
is
unusual
and
not
exactly
welcome
wow
one
of
my
favorite
cigar
city
beers
i
wish
they
would
make
a
more
affordable
and
regularly
available
saison
because
they
sure
know
how
to
do
it
o
cigar
city
makes
some
great
saisons
and
this
one
definitely
isnt
any
different
nice
lightly
sweet
melon
taste
balanced
with
a
lightly
tart
finish
nothing
stood
out
about
this
beer
for
me
but
it
was
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
that
was
tasty
and
definitely
drinkable
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
however
if
i
was
in
florida
i
would
probably
get
it
if
you
like
saisons
and
guavamelons
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
out
o
an
outstanding
very
sour
beer
with
enough
fruitiness
and
spiciness
to
call
it
a
saison
base
this
is
a
must
have
beer
for
fans
of
sours
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
hard
to
find
in
upstate
ny
overall
good
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
just
too
sweet
and
fruity
i
opened
this
expecting
the
worst
but
i
must
say
it
was
a
wonderful
surprise
not
something
that
i
would
drink
daily
but
i
have
to
have
it
again
if
i
were
to
have
had
this
blind
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
a
fruit
or
a
wild
ale
the
wild
yeast
and
guava
seem
to
cancel
one
other
out
im
not
sure
if
the
brett
was
intentional
or
not
but
it
makes
for
a
pretty
decent
saison
despite
the
fact
that
any
hint
of
guava
is
pretty
much
non
exsistant
however
this
could
be
an
older
bottle
im
probably
not
going
to
seek
this
out
again
but
id
be
interested
in
trying
its
counterparts
glad
i
tried
it
and
might
get
it
again
but
not
a
huge
fan
o
great
saison
and
i
love
the
guava
twist
to
this
a
wild
yet
refined
brew
so
many
great
saisons
in
this
world
what
a
great
style
from
the
big
bottle
purchased
at
food
and
friends
in
philadelphia
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
try
the
guava
is
stronger
than
i
expected
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
classic
saison
with
some
strong
biscuit
malt
notes
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
tartness
lemon
and
light
funk
the
flavor
is
similar
the
biscuit
and
toffee
malt
go
very
well
with
the
wheat
and
a
little
bit
of
tartness
the
light
acidic
notes
work
very
well
and
add
to
the
beers
drinkability
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
overall
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
saison
more
like
a
cider
never
had
a
wild
ale
so
this
is
my
first
sour
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
really
get
the
hype
its
tasty
for
what
it
is
but
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
of
a
saison
o
my
first
cigar
city
brew
i
had
big
expectations
from
the
smell
but
the
flavors
were
a
little
bit
sweet
and
it
came
off
rich
for
my
liking
it
probably
rates
higher
as
a
beer
than
it
does
against
others
in
the
style
in
my
eyes
i
probably
wont
be
getting
this
again
but
if
you
like
sweeter
saisons
rather
than
dry
or
funky
give
it
a
try
o
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
ive
certainly
had
better
and
ive
certainly
had
worse
i
prefer
saisons
that
have
a
bigger
tartsour
presence
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
and
its
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
or
if
you
are
looking
for
a
drinkable
introduction
to
the
style
as
the
portfolio
is
there
but
its
not
overwhelming
overall
great
saison
wish
it
smelled
more
like
guava
satisfied
with
the
guava
flavor
once
the
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
o
i
cant
drink
more
than
just
a
few
sips
the
astringency
is
just
too
much
not
the
kind
of
tart
i
love
in
a
beer
very
disappointing
overall
a
solid
saison
with
a
subtle
guava
flavor
o
interesting
beer
on
paper
it
sounds
super
funky
in
a
glass
its
entertaining
and
a
different
interpretation
of
a
classic
style
of
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
more
tartsour
than
it
should
be
for
the
style
but
i
happen
to
enjoy
that
will
buy
again

nothing
im

though
just
a

i
prefer
them
lighter
and
more

this
overall
this
is
a
fine
saison
i
would
be
happy
to
have
this
again
o
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
i
was
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
above
avergae
yes
great
no
good
twist
for
the
style
but
ive
enjoyed
others
more
overall
this
was
very
refreshing
and
i
enjoyed
it
serving
type
bottle
750ml
im
really
not
sure
why
this
isnt
called
a
wild
ale
the
sour
punch
from
the
combination
of
the
yeast
and
guava
is
quite
nice
but
definitely
does
not
taste
much
like
other
saisons
i
have
had
also
there
is
just
a
slight
vinegar
presence
in
the
taste
overall
quite
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
also
excellent
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
the
reason
i
didnt
give
it
a
5
is
that
to
me
it
could
be
a
little
more
carbonated
i
love
carbonation
and
what
makes
wild
ales
is
their
wild
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
however
and
i
would
recommend
getting
it
if
available
highly
carbonated
crisp
dry
bitter
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
pepper
and
guava
very
enjoyable
they
nailed
this
one
plenty
of
fruitiness
with
a
very
dry
finish
would
definitely
drink
again
im
not
terribly
familiar
with
this
style
but
i
liked
the
beer
a
lot
my
only
regret
is
that
i
did
not
get
to
pair
it
with
food
as
this
would
be
unbelievable
with
a
tropical
fish
dish
such
as
mango
mahi
mahi
o
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
nice
guava
but
cant
help
but
wondered
if
this
has
soured
still
delicious
but
clearly
not
what
the
initial
beer
was
o
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
taste
and
drinkability
i
enjoyed
the
plentiful
carbonation
which
made
this
beer
unbelievably
light
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
it
possesses
i
have
to
admit
though
the
unstoppable
foaming
head
from
the
pour
is
a
bit
cumbersome
for
sure
beyond
this
i
have
no
other
complaints
and
would
love
to
try
this
refreshing
beer
again
its
rare
to
see
any
cigar
city
beers
around
my
area
but
ill
be
sure
to
buy
more
of
this
brew
and
other
offerings
if
i
see
them
again
in
the
future
very
good
for
the
style
i
really
like
this
overall
this
was
excellent
i
acquired
this
one
in
a
trade
and
now
am
kinda
bummed
i
didnt
get
more
best
saison
ive
tried
thus
far
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
saison
personally
i
like
a
little
more
tartness
in
my
saisons
and
less
earthiness
but
the
fruity
peppery
quality
was
great
i
couldnt
really
tell
if
there
was
guava
in
this
or
not
and
not
sure
how
much
was
actually
used
for
secondary
fermentation
still
there
is
a
fruity
quality
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
i
will
probably
attribute
to
the
guava
nicely
done
i
would
drink
this
again
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
and
goes
down
too
easily
o
a
tasty
beer
very
drinkable
not
sure
if
ive
had
a
guava
or
not
but
this
is
a
nice
tropical
drink
i
would
love
to
now
more
about
this
thing
saison
it
is
not
wild
ale
what
bugs
or
yeast
did
they
use
this
is
a
strange
one
but
i
like
it
o
there
are
bad
fruit
infused
beers
but
this
is
not
one
its
subtle
and
it
adds
to
the
complexity
rather
than
overtakes
the
beer
nice
delicious
beer
i
heard
they
took
the
sourfunk
from
this
too
bad
i
liked
this
because
it
was
different
the
guava
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
typical
fruits
usually
put
in
beer
overall
though
the
flavor
was
onedimensional
and
it
drinks
like
juice
and
finishes
like
a
dry
wine
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
o
definitely
seek
this
one
out
one
of
the
best
cc
offerings
ive
had
up
there
with
zhukov
very
complex
and
unique
for
an
american
saison
o
very
good
saison
great
blend
of
a
traditional
saison
flavors
with
all
of
the
tropical
fruits
that
accompany
this
beer
overall
this
is
very
good
and
can
stand
up
with
plenty
of
other
saisons
taste
is
much
the
same
almost
lambic
or
gueuzelike

are

o

beer
from
ccb
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
unusual
beer
give
this
a
shot
if
you
get
a
chance
the
beer
was
fairly
hard
to
acquire
and
had
a
relatively
steep
price
tag
for
a
saison
it
was
a
fruity
and
unique
saison
but
it
had
a
terrible
carbonation
overload
effect
on
my
stomach
that
detracted
from
my
overall
enjoyment
therefore
im
on
the
bubble
with
my
recommendation
but
youll
probably
love
it
if
you
love
champagne
o
i
tried
reading
through
the
forums
as
i
remember
some
discussion
of
whether
this
was
intentionally
sour
i
bought
this
last
summer
but
dont
see
a
bottle
date
so
no
idea
what
batch
it
is
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
saison
but
whatever
it
is
i
really
enjoyed
it
hope
the
tartness
isnt
absent
in
current
batches
o
another
great
beer
from
cigar
city
very
easy
to
drink
you
would
have
no
problem
finishing
a
750ml
bottle
on
your
own
get
it
if
you
can
man
if
it
werent
for
the
foam
this
would
be
really
outstanding
as
a
saison
its
still
pretty
darn
good
surprisingly
like
this
more
than
guava
groove
which
supposedly
had
more
guava
this
one
is
good
although
i
normally
dont
like
saisons
o
an
enjoyable
saison
to
be
sure
just
not
what
i
was
lead
to
believe
from
reviews
could
do
with
more
hops
presence
from
a
noble
hop
at
60
mins
with
say
57
alpha
acids
and
dry
hopping
i
initially
drank
this
without
food
and
was
generally
pleased
but
not
wowed
by
it
though
it
certainly
grew
on
me
with
time
however
a
second
round
with
some
spicy
noodles
read
a
good
amount
of
sriracha
and
i
was
immediately
hooked
im
inclined
to
drink
it
only
with
spicy
food
from
now
on
but
its
nevertheless
a
solid
saison
good
stuff
from
a
very
good
brewery
o
i
cant
really
explain
why
but
this
beer
works
granted
it
wont
appeal
to
those
who
like
a
classically
styled
saison
but
it
is
extremely
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
without
the
brett
infectionovercarbonation
the
beer
might
have
been
a
real
gem
worth
trying
but
maybe
not
quite
enough
so
to
seek
out
actively
the
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
very
light
and
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
tingly
feel
lends
itself
well
to
the
dry
finish
solid
but
as
far
as
the
price
goes
and
the
overall
quality
of
the
beer
i
think
that
i
would
pass
on
this
next
time
cheers
o
a
very
average
beer
the
guava
was
too
subdued
and
should
have
played
a
larger
role
in
the
flavour
profile
thumbs
up
honestly
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
a
complex
farmhousestyle
beer
that
is
fruityfloral
and
completely
drinkable
it
has
all
the
trappings
for
the
style
and
a
unique
identity
in
itself
get
on
it
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
definitely
in
the
funkywild
subfamily
of
saisons
it
actually
tastes
like
it
might
have
some
brett
in
it
even
though
it
does
not
it
is
quite
tart
in
nature
i
like
itbut
it
doesnt
have
that
smoothness
or
balance
that
i
am
looking
for
its
not
hoppy
at
all
but
i
dont
think
that
it
was
before
aging
either
it
has
cellared
well
o
a
good
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
groove
because
it
is
a
little
more
intense
in
terms
of
the
guava
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
one
again
though
and
could
see
introducing
people
that
are
newer
to
beer
to
this
one
o
my
first
cigar
city
beer
didnt
dissappoint
at
all
this
is
a
well
crafted
well
balanced
and
well
thought
out
beer
very
super
nice
o
this
is
one
sour
saison
unfortunately
im
not
detecting
hardly
any
belgian
yeast
but
its
still
damn
good
tastes
like
a
sour
applepineapplecherry
candy
very
unique
and
quite
refreshing
sip
it
enjoy
it
be
kind
to
it
and
it
will
be
kind
to
you
pours
a
clear
brownish
orange
with
a
big
white
head
the
nose
is

guava
banana

smells
distinctly
like
a
sour
the
taste
is
not
tart
but
more
vinegar
sour
with
orange
and
lemon
zest
light
guava
banana
and
a
little
pepperclove
spice
its
decent
but
a
little
more
tartness
and
guava
would
go
really
nicely
in
here
the
mouthfeel
is
sour
and
very
carbonated
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
makes
me
wonder
what
guava
groove
is
like
because
it
has
potential
it
does
seem
a
bit
off
style
this
is
very
unique
nice
off
white
head
that
settles
slowly
in
the

has
the
typical
farmhouse
smell
with
a
clash
of

sour
fruits
strong
sweet
aroma
of
apples
guava
and
other
fruits
i
cant
figure
out
and
tastes
just
the

almost
sharp

this

citrus
feint
guava
and
light
pepper
taste
follows
the
nose
nothing
stands
out
intensly
but
the
flavors
come
together
in
sweet
deliciousness
i
love
this
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
rediculously
refreshing
i
wish
everyone
could
try
this
beer
o
a
super
drinkable
tart
saison
that
im
really
finding
to
be
a
wonderfully
complex
brew
solid
work
ccb
this
ones
a
keeper
overall
a
winner
in
my
book
a
really
good
saison
as
the
base
beer
which
is
given
some
nice
tropical
notes
with
the
help
of
the
guava
unexpected
sweet
sour
vinegar
on
the
nose
taste
is
sour
and
sweet
immediately
then
a
funky
tropical
bitter
nutty
dry
fruit
pits
aftertaste
dominates
the
back
as
it
warms
the
distinct
contrast
between
sour
and
dry
bitterness
makes
this
a
very
interesting
and
unique
brew
pours
a
beautifully
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
massive
four
finger
mountainous
head
looks
amazing
the
aroma
is
slightly
tart
with
tons
of
banana
and
pineapple
guava
is
coming
through
but
banana
and
pineapple
dominate
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
clove
coming
through
as
well
the
taste
is
absolutely
incredible
slightly
tart
in
the
front
but
banana
and
clove
shine
all
the
way
through
guava
and
pineapple
are
present
but
take
a
backseat
to
the
banana
and
clove
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
relatively
high
overall
incredible
interpretation
of
a
farmhouse
ale
i
definitely
taste
some
funk
but
nowhere
near
a
traditional
saison
such
as
dupont
easy
to
drink
and
bursting
with
juicy
flavor
a
very
unique
brew
and
one
that
i
recommend
highly
the
mix
of
these
two
5050
was
phenomenal
you
get
the
hint
of
the
funk
with
the
guava
shining
through
very
tasty
overall
superb
beer
this
must
be
one
of
the
most
easy
drinking
yet
complex
and
flavourful
beer
i
have
come
across
if
i
lived
in
florida
i
would
drink
this
stuff
every
day
in
summer
o
i
liked
this
a
lot
moreso
then
the
dupont
saison
maltier
than
any
other
ive
had
in
the
style
and
the
guava
fruit
works
to
perfection
unique
for
the
style
i
feel
especially
with
the
malt
backbone
im
falling
for
ccb
and
their
brews
overall
a
tasty
saison
not
as
much
guava
as
id
hoped
but
still
quite
good
o
im
really
starting
to
love
this
style
beer
like
this
has
a
lovable
combination
of
refreshing
flavors
with
complexity
to
boot
excellent
brew
cigar
city
cant
wait
for
jai
alai
and
big
sound
o
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
the
guava
flavor
is
left
to
linger
way
in
the
back
of
the
sip
which
is
what
i
really
enjoy
about
this
i
have
yet
to
try
something
that
fails
to
live
up
to
expectations
from
this
brewery
huge
thanks
to
davehack
for
yet
again
sending
me
an
amazing
box
a
true
advocate
o
i
really
like
this
beer
its
an
awesome
example
of
a
fruit
saison
with
the
funky
sweet
clove
banana
citrus
really
nice
carbonation
and
the
guava
goes
so
nice
with
it
overall
a
good
brew
didnt
get
any
of
the
hoppiness
usually
present
in
saisons
but
thats
ok
i
still
enjoyed
this
wouldnt
mind
aging
one
for
a
year
or
so
o
didnt
expect
this
to
be
so
sour
but
im
happy
it
was
an
excellent
offering
from
ccb
o
really
good
flavor
but
it
was
a
bit
much
after
a
while
overall
really
enjoyable
though
mouthfeel
dry
and
sugary
not
as
nice
as
the
latter
decent
body
a
bit
cloying
wow
this
is
one
interesting
saison
with
a
lot
of
funky
character
more
like
a
wild
ale
than
a
saison
for
the
most
part
but
very
tasty
and
agreeable
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
hand
thanks
to
mntlover
for
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
bottle
this
is
a
really
great
take
on
the
style
and
is
rather
balanced
im
a
fan
o
this
is
currently
my
favorite
saison
i
get
turned
off
by
an
overly
funkymusty
saisons
but
this
brew
features
the
fruitier
notes
with
a
refreshing
tartness
this
is
well
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
think
you
dont
like
saisons
i
would
take
a
saison
dupont
or
hennepin
any
day
over
this
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
ok
when
i
read
the
label
i
didnt
read
anything
about
wild
93100
o
an
excellent
offering
by
ccb
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
definitely
go
back
for
some
more
its
very
unique
and
nothing
ive
tried
before
tastes
like
this
o
tough
to
call
between
4
and
4
5
a
great
beer
and
i
liked
the
unique
qualities
the
guava
provided
highly
recommended
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
rather
different
than
anything
else
ive
had
definitely
different
than
any
saison
but
not
super
different
from
most
american
wild
ales
overall
impression
for
my
first
brew
from
cigar
city
im
over
impressed
unbelievable
saison
in
almost
every
category
especially
from
the
site
of
it
being
poured
refreshing
spicy
strong
fruits
and
has
the
good
sourness
i
always
look
for
in
a
saison
im
ready
for
another
cigar
city
brew
now
thanks
mark
overall
is
amazing
my
first
cigar
city
beer
and
im
really
looking
forward
to
seeking
out
more
of
their
beers
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
fills
almost
half
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
overwhelmingly
strong
to
the
point
where
it
hits
you
the
second
the
beer
touches
the
glass
theres
a
strong
acidic
citrus
smell
with
a
lot
of
barnyard
funk
the
taste
is
extremely
tart
upfront
with
a
lot
of
different
citrus
flavors
coming
together
from
the
hops
and
yeast
a
strong
grapefruit
lemon
and
of
course
guava
presence
theres
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
and
yeast
esters
as
well
the
sour
tart
flavors
cover
up
a
lot
of
the
flavors
at
first
but
as
it
warms
up
a
lot
more
subtle
notes
come
out
carbonation
is
high
with
a
super
dry
finish
combining
with
the
tartness
to
make
this
one
a
real
lip
puckerer
somewhere
between
a
wild
ale
and
a
saison
a
nice
beer
with
tons
and
tons
of
things
going
on
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
it
nugganooch
for
the
style
this
rocks
d
a
very
well
done
fruit
beer
judging
it
by
style
i
am
less
impressed
but
it
is
still
a
solid
brew
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
very
drinkable
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
fizzy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
foamy
cap
thick
streaks
of
foamy
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
extremely
funky
and
acidic
with
vinegar
and
sour
fruit
aromas
a
very
mouthwatering
smell
taste
is
of
sour
fruits
vinegar
and
funk
a
subtle
guava
taste
comes
through
on
the
aftertaste
after
each
sip
the
carbonation
level
on
this
one
is
high
with
a
very
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
more
like
a
sour
than
a
saison
i
have
read
that
some
of
the
earlier
bottles
were
infected
and
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
them
however
this
is
an
extremely
pleasant
beer
even
with
an
infection
in
it
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
version
very
sharp
sour
beer
it
makes
an
impression
but
could
also
have
been
very
drinkable
if
the
edges
were
smoothed
out
drink
a
nice
beer
i
like
saisons
so
i
am
kinda
harsh
on
them
this
was
a
bit
lighter
with
a
semicrisp
flavor
and
a
bit
dry
overall
a
really
nice
crafted
saison
id
love
another
bottle
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
king
of
lingering
flavor
profile
overall
pretty
good
here
for
the
most
part
i
would
say
i
would
just
grab
a
regular
saison
but
this
is
a
tasty
treat
either
way
tastes
is
sharp
broken
up
slightly
by
the
intense
carbonation
orange
rind
like
crazy
this
carbonation
is
too
much
too
many
pennies
in
the
taste
i
dont
like
it
o
i
like
this
beer
but
its
nothing
that
id
freak
out
over
of
course
im
not
much
of
a
saison
lover
though
i
do
enjoy
sours
as
a
whole
id
probably
take
le
terroir
of
this
beer
7
out
of
10
times
and
take
this
the
other
3
times
just
for
a
change
one
of
the
better
saisons
for
me
when
introducing
people
to
the
saison
style
i
mention
that
there
is
considerably
more
variance
in
the
spectrum
of
flavors
present
from
one
beer
to
the
next
than
in
almost
any
other
style
of
beer
saisons
are
meant
to
be
funky
and
a
little
offbeat
and
guava
grove
is
a
perfect
example
highly
recommended
ill
be
buying
another
bottle
soon
incredibly
refreshing
and
quite
astonishingly
drinkable
for
an
8
abv
brew
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
quite
as
sophisticated
as
this
but
this
is
a
beer
brewed
with
fruit
done
right
really
enjoyable
o
i
like
this
beer
alot
i
admittedly
am
new
to
saisons
and
dubky
brews
but
this
is
great
and
would
love
to
get
this
more
regularly
i
would
also
like
to
try
the
original
batchto
see
how
much
they
differ
i
like
this
one
its
a
little
different
for
a
saison
but
good
overall
very
nice
tartness
on
flanders
level
more
so
then
saison
but
enjoyable
non
the
less
just
wasnt
expecting
so
much
edit
this
was
the
older
sour
version
the
new
one
is
good
but
not
this
good
d
this
is
almost
a
perfect
summer
beer
if
i
was
in
charge
i
would
ask
for
this
in
the
6
range
vs
8
but
very
easy
drinking
given
the
alcohol
level
a
keg
of
this
would
be
great
for
the
summer
highly
recommended
overall
pretty
light
on
the
palate
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
well
would
go
well
w
some
other
light
foods
or
salad
thanks
again
to
hoptualbrew
for
this
one
prosit
o
its
always
frustrating
when
you
have
a
beer
that
you
have
always
wanted
to
try
and
it
turns
out
being
compromised
in
some
way
unfortunately
when
there
is
no
bottle
date
on
a
beer
this
can
happen
i
will
seek
to
give
this
among
other
cigar
city
offerings
a
second
chance
with
a
trade
directly
from
the
source
i
have
had
a
mix
of
things
i
really
liked
and
a
mix
of
things
i
was
incredibly
disappointed
with
the
latter
usually
being
an
infected
or
otherwise
compromised
bottle
i
dont
wish
to
post
this
review
as
a
form
of
slander
but
it
helps
me
document
a
negative
experience
with
the
hopes
of
eventually
redeeming
it
ill
give
you
another
chance
guava
grove
but
i
wont
get
my
hopes
up
mf
medium
bodied
but
crisp
a
heathy
amount
of
carbonation
keeps
it
crisp
and
feeling
lighter
on
the
palate
overall
still
trying
to
expand
my
palate
with
sours
beers
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
i
want
to
have
another
bottle
of
this
beer
anytime
soon
this
beer
was
just
great
instead
of
the
extreme
tartness
and
sourness
the
old
guava
grove
presented
this
one
presented
a
great
saison
funkiness
that
paired
very
well
with
the
upfront
guava
notes
to
make
a
delicious
smelling
and
tasting
beer
the
drinkability
is
probably
the
beers
finest
hour
if
this
is
still
clocking
in
at
around
8
its
some
sort
of
miracle
since
it
now
drinks
like
its
a
4
5
beer
seriously
try
the
new
guava
grove
its
really
really
good
nice
pour
into
a
russian
river
snifter
glass
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
big
two
finger
head
that
starts
to
subside
after
a
minute
or
two
head
never
totally
disappears
with
the
first
smell
belgian
session
sort
of
grassy
but
then
quickly
overtaken
by
the
smell
of
guava
the
finish
is
almost
like
im
standing
in
a
citrus
grove
i
pick
up
other
citrus
fruits
beside
guava
as
well
oranges
the
taste
characteristics
almost
mirror
the
smell
farmhouse
session
up
front
with
the
guava
coming
through
strong
in
the
finish
not
like
biting
into
the
fruit
itself
but
the
taste
you
would
get
from
the
juice
slightly
sour
with
some
grapefruit
taste
as
well
sour
on
the
aftertaste
citrus
orange
guava
and
grapefruit
juices
mixed
together
nice
and
crisp
light
bodied
with
balanced
amount
of
carbonation
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
othis
is
a
good
saison
very
representative
of
the
style
imo
not
my
favorite
cigar
city
brew
but
for
this
time
of
the
year
in
miami
i
enjoyed
it
tremendously
o
2nd
saison
of
the
night
and
we
are
two
for
two
with
unexpected
sours
really
not
at
all
what
i
expected
before
opening
the
bottle
sourtartness
really
gives
this
a
wildness
and
makes
it
hard
to
think
of
this
as
a
saison
it
isnt
bad
but
certainly
isnt
going
to
blow
you
away
either
even
looking
at
it
as
a
sour
good
to
have
tried
it
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
overall
when
i
was
at
the
brewery
i
had
the
less
sour
version
of
this
beer
im
not
sure
which
one
i
prefer
but
this
was
a
nice
sour
fruit
beer
o
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
hope
to
get
another
bottle
in
the
future
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
opening
this
one
up
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
bells
tulip
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
with
no
head
just
a
thin
bubbly
band
around
the
edges
some
lacing
but
weak
legs
nose
is
pretty
fantastic
lots
of
tropical
fruit
character
a
tartness
cork
and
medicinal
phenols
as
the
brew
warms
it
actually
reminds
me
a
bit
of
duck
duck
gooze
in
some
ways
taste
is
tart
citrusy
salty
and
a
bit
medicinal
these
qualities
really
overwhelm
any
suggestion
of
tropical
fruit
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
prickly
overly
assertive
carbonation
acidic
and
astringent
overall
if
youre
expecting
a
saison
you
arent
going
to
get
any
of
the
classic
qualities
here
in
my
opinion
its
closer
to
an
american
wild
its
definitely
an
interesting
brew
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
all
and
all
less
sour
and
tart
than
medicinal
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
have
had
it
several
times
like
the
mix
of
flavors
and
really
dig
how
tropical
the
fruits
are
nice
work
o
nice
beer
something
that
would
really
hit
the
spot
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
guava
beer
ive
heard
there
was
some
batch
variance
in
this
but
the
one
i
have
is
worth
trying
note
ive
heard
that
the
recipe
for
this
year
has
changed
fro
last
year
to
this
year
supposedly
last
years
was
sour
and
in
this
years
version
the
fruity
was
the
driving
force
ill
venture
to
guess
that
i
just
had
last
years
so
i
picked
up
a
couple
more
bottles
for
comparison
the
flavor
is
decidedly
more
tart
than
the
aroma
suggested
but
the
guava
again
saves
the
day
with
a
fruity
juicy
balance
hints
of
acetone
in
the
finish
amplified
by
a
spritzy
carbonation
level
body
is
somewhat
thin
and
again
the
bubbles
are
massive
and
numerousa
bit
too
sodalike
for
me
still
a
very
tasty
very
unique
beer
and
a
great
summer
beer
despite
the
8
abv
cigar
city
has
a
winner
with
guava
grove
o
i
read
another
review
here
that
if
i
recall
correctly
stated
very
strongly
that
this
really
disappointed
the
reviewer
as
a
potential
summer
beer
but
i
have
to
say
i
really
disagree
this
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
would
pop
open
on
my
lawn
chair
on
a
hot
summer
day
assuming
its
served
quite
cold
another
nice
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
i
didnt
see
a
big
flavor
transition
as
it
warmed
up
so
i
feel
like
you
can
pretty
guiltlessly
drink
this
ice
cold
really
super
drinkable
and
pretty
delicious
with
a
good
mouthfeel
my
first
cigar
city
and
it
has
me
interested
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
fantastic
it
seemed
more
like
a
wild
ale
than
a
saison
to
me
this
was
the
major
surprise
hit
at
our
tasting
that
night
tart
juicy
fruit
forward
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
i
will
definitely
be
looking
to
find
more
bottles
of
this
edit
i
will
go
back
and
try
this
one
again
got
a
feeling
i
got
an
infected
bottle
i
know
about
sour
beers
this
one
had
more
of
a
rot
thing
going
on
o
good
beer
but
just
dont
know
what
its
supposed
to
be
in
the
beer
style
world
o
this
beer
is
pretty
delicious
and
has
some
mild
sour
notes
but
they
are
still
quite
prevalent
the
flavors
are
all
very
well
crafted
but
work
very
well
together
good
sour
and
funky
saison
overall
this
was
a
mostly
forgettable
and
just
decent
beer
but
the
guava
undertones
save
it
from
complete
mediocrity
i
liked
ccb
but
this
wasnt
the
best
offering
pours
a
light
reddishorange
color
big
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
walls
smell
is
brettfunkish
with
some
saison
yeast
and
a
light
caramel
aroma
thrown
in
for
good
measure
much
more
sour
than
i
remember
this
being
on
tap
slightly
fruity
but
the
sourness
is
what
really
comes
through
here
less
of
a
saison
than
it
is
a
sour
beer
dry
as
well
not
so
much
reminiscent
of
wilds
as
it
is
flemish
sours
lively
and
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
and
i
dont
quite
know
how
to
rate
it
on
draft
i
remember
this
being
refreshing
and
fruity
and
now
its
very
sour
d
other
than
the
color
this
reminded
me
a
little
of
certain
batches
of
fantôme
even
though
that
beer
doesnt
contain
guava
im
told
theres
no
wild
yeast
used
in
this
beer
but
perhaps
some
snuck
in
on
the
fruit
skins
as
this
definitely
had
some
of
that
character
to
it
we
crushed
the
750ml
bottle
no
problem
and
it
was
one
of
the
bigger
hits
of
the
evening
ive
had
some
sour
saisons
but
this
destroys
them
all
i
was
expecting
a
slightly
more
sweet
flavor
profile
based
on
the
name
but
hey
im
not
complaining
this
is
a
great
beer
this
beer
pours
a
sunset
orange
in
color
with
a
one
finger
self
destructive
head
it
smells
of
lightly
sweet
guava
juice
with
a
light
tartness
it
actually
kind
of
smells
like
sweet
tarts
the
flavor
is
an
in
your
face
acidic
fruit
juice
with
a
dry
yeasty
finish
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
tart
after
the
initially
sweet
nose
its
solid
but
lost
between
a
traditional
saison
and
a
true
sour
which
is
fine
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
and
an
interesting
drink
mad
props
to
the
random
customer
who
passed
on
the
positive
karma
do
loved
it
as
did
everyone
else
very
different
mmm
mmm
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
i
poured
myself
another
recommended
o
easily
the
most
unique
saison
ive
ever
had
very
well
done
picked
up
a
bomber
and
poured
in
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
pours
with
a
ton
of
foam
out
of
the
bottle
but
settles
into
a
bright
slightly
opaque
orangecaramel
coloring
with
a
final
settle
of
about
an
inch
of
frothy
foamy
big
bubbled
head
aromas
are
astringent
and
robust
with
pepper
and
coriander
spices
a
little
booze
some
citrus
sweetness
and
tangy
guava
body
is
slick
and
slightly
oily
but
with
a
decent
lacing
flavor
is
straightforward
and
tangy
fruit
sweetness
with
orange
and
peach
ending
on
the
guava
again
with
a
boozey
balance
the
aftertaste
is
floral
and
spicy
with
dry
and
slightly
puckering
finish
very
tasty
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
completely
opaque
murky
burnt
orange
with
lots
of
carbonation
visible
and
a
thin
white
head
that
receded
to
almost
nothing
earthy
aroma
full
of
fresh
fruit
and
spice
and
a
bit
of
funk
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
more
or
less
yeasty
with
obvious
fruit
in
the
foregroundguava
mainly
with
peach
and
apricot
also
noticeable
very
earthy
with
spicy
tones
of
cloves
and
very
light
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
full
bodied
chewy
and
pretty
drinkable
though
probably
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
cheers
when
it
poured
there
was
a
huge
billowy
white
head
which
quickly
receded
to
q
slight
ring
this
beer
is
orange
and
opaque
nothing
special
the
aroma
is
very
nice
lots
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
background
of
saison
spice
the
flavor
is
the
same
except
instead
of
just
thinking
tropical
i
can
specifically
pick
out
the
guava
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
perhaps
a
mild
astringency
unortunately
this
is
a
bit
undercarbonated
despite
the
large
head
originally
very
nice
tropical
summery
saison
dont
drink
and
review
really
this
should
be
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
its
not
like
a
saison
but
i
can
understand
how
that
was
used
as
the
base
beer
this
is
missing
the
rich
funky
spice
though
it
doesnt
have
a
comparable
bitterness
albeit
a
smoother
fruiter
hop
character
i
will
definitely
get
a
few
more
bottles
next
time
i
see
it
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
definitely
a
delicious
saison
and
i
like
the
addition
of
guava
although
i
remember
this
being
much
tarter
out
of
the
bottle
than
it
was
on
tap
overall
this
is
quite
a
different
saison
it
could
be
refreshing
on
a
really
hot
day
i
found
this
similar
to
the
duchesse
de
bourgogne
but
more
sour
fruity
and
tart
i
wonder
if
there
are
other
sour
beers
out
there
that
are
similar
but
i
have
not
had
many
to
try
and
compare
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
sue
how
i
feel
about
it
yet
as
the
label
states
it
is
certainly
unlike
any
other
saison
i
have
ever
had
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
but
it
was
certainly
a
memorable
experience
popped
a
bottle
last
night
916
i
dont
think
it
was
guava
wild
but
sure
had
a
funk
too
way
more
so
than
the
first
bottle
infected
i
think
which
made
it
more
ok
then
great
as
i
was
looking
for
what
i
had
the
first
time
its
a
good
beer
overall
its
possible
some
aging
would
mellow
the
beer
and
if
thats
the
case
most
of
my
scores
will
go
up
though
its
got
some
nice
flavors
and
is
enjoyable
its
somewhat
difficult
to
drink
because
of
the
tartness
and
dryness
d
an
interesting
concept
with
decent
at
best
execution
neither
a
hit
nor
a
miss
but
would
only
recommend
if
you
think
this
may
be
of
interest
probably
my
list
favorite
cigar
city
offering
to
date
oi
feel
torn
on
this
beer
on
one
hand
i
love
the
way
it
looks
smells
and
feels
i
also
admire
the
innovation
in
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
i
am
just
not
in
love
with
how
it
tastes
maybe
with
less
carbonation
i
would
enjoy
it
more
but
i
still
think
i
prefer
a
traditional
saison
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
just
not
my
favorite
man
i
dont
know
if
i
have
had
a
better
saison
brewed
in
america
this
is
excellent
even
from
all
worldwide
versions
i
think
this
demands
a
seat
at
the
best
of
table
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
kkipple
for
sharing
this
one
while
on
the
bus
this
weekend
served
from
bottle
into
a
brewvival
sampler
imperial
pint
poured
a
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
and
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
fruit
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonaton
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
i
had
this
a
long
time
back
via
a
growler
and
absolutely
loved
it
not
a
lot
has
changed
since
this
this
is
a
great
brew
and
the
sourtart
aspect
really
shines
through
on
this
one
with
flying
colors
i
would
never
have
guessed
this
was
a
saison
if
i
didnt
already
know
really
glad
i
to
try
this
one
again
get
this
one
on
your
palate
you
wont
regret
it
umm
guava
light
orange
color
nice
lacing
off
the
sweet
taps
of
rattle
n
hum
yeah
so
im
not
the
most
familiar
with
the
guava
taste
but
now
i
feel
like
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
very
interesting
flavor
combination
the
guava
and
yeast
play
a
great
game
impossible
to
decide
a
winner
a
little
sour
a
little
sweet
guava
fruity
theres
a
bit
of
funk
in
there
as
well
and
it
finishes
surprisingly
dry
for
the
initial
flavor
unique
has
been
said
before
and
it
will
be
said
again
digg
it
this
tasted
closer
to
a
sparkling
wine
than
a
beer
a
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
the
guava
comes
through
nicely
this
was
in
a
large
pint
bottle
but
all
i
needed
was
half
a
glass
as
suggested
in
other
reviews
it
could
be
interesting
how
this
beer
ages
it
might
be
smoother
more
drinkable
bottle
from
whole
foods
tampa
beer
is
thinner
than
expected
and
brighter
on
the
palate
than
i
thought
more
solvent
more
acetic
finishes
super
dry
very
acetic
very
acidic
a
little
rougher
and
harsher
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
like
more
fruits
and
less
aggressive
sourness
overall
it
was
ok
but
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
quite
the
tasty
treat
we
have
here
great
mouth
feel
obviously
big
spritzy
tongue
clearing
carbonation
considering
its
a
saison
lovely
acidity
light
funk
earth
bready
malts
in
the
middle
belgian
spice
yeasty
effervescent
tropical
layers
of
guava
clove
and
banana
peel
love
the
way
the
guava
adds
length
and
depth
to
the
finish
delicious
orangey
brew
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
a
lot
like
a
belgian
gold
it
lingers
you
can
smell
the
tartness
in
the
next
room
this
brew
comes
out
full
force
a
fruity
funkiness
taste
is
overwhelmingly
tart
making
this
a
sipping
brew
some
sour
notes
mix
in
with
the
guava
and
the
fruitiness
of
a
saison
definite
alcohol
presence
at
the
end
big
and
unique
brew
closer
to
a
true
lambic
than
a
saison
getting
some
age
on
this
one
might
do
some
good
this
seems
to
be
another
miss
in
cigar
citys
attempts
to
make
a
funky
brettesque
beer
why
on
earth
they
are
taking
a
would
be
nice
guava
infused
saison
and
putting
it
through
their
rather
awful
wild
fermenting
process
is
beyond
me
stop
doing
this
and
if
youre
going
to
refine
and
master
the
process
o
intense
and
complex
on
the
palate
a
great
beer
and
one
meant
to
be
shared
d
a
saison
more
like
a
solid
wild
ale
to
me
a
great
burst
of
sour
and
acidic
characters
with
a
bigger
carbonation
level
and
a
nice
fruit
profile
if
the
carbonation
level
was
just
toned
down
a
bit
this
would
be
very
fantastic
the
big
surprise
of
our
evening
overall
as
i
said
the
taste
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
the
idea
is
great
and
the
execution
in
terms
of
layering
and
balance
is
top
notch
just
not
hitting
it
off
with
my
palette
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
sipper
may
have
to
get
a
few
bottles
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
medium
to
high
the
higher
abv
helps
to
balance
this
from
being
too
carbonated
or
the
other
way
around
the
belgian
yeast
prevents
it
from
being
to
sweetcloying
but
i
digress
overall
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
will
add
to
my
warm
weather
arsenal
would
have
no
desire
for
this
in
the
colder
months
but
perfect
for
right
now
o
well
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
im
totally
digging
it
that
being
said
its
rather
far
from
what
i
would
have
expected
from
a
saison
im
not
knocking
it
im
just
saying
we
all
tasted
some
apple
in
it
i
raised
my
original
overall
score
since
i
feel
that
this
will
age
well
with
time
the
acid
level
paired
with
the
8
abv
should
allow
this
to
be
able
to
be
lain
down
for
a
few
years
the
acrid
flavors
should
mellow
nicely
overall
i
really
loved
this
beer
i
cant
believe
i
have
waited
this
long
to
try
it
i
will
be
isoing
o
very
enjoyable
to
sip
on
in
the
afternoon
or
evening
after
a
long
day
despite
its
tartness
its
fairly
easy
on
the
palate
splitting
this
into
three
servings
would
also
yield
reasonable
sized
servings
id
buy
again
if
i
could
find
it
would
like
to
try
different
dryhopped
versions
overall
this
beer
was
not
good
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
im
surprised
it
has
been
so
well
received
this
is
only
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
cigar
city
and
well
i
might
have
a
hard
time
going
back
if
hunaphu
wasnt
so
incredibly
good
i
was
expecting
a
saison
with
a
bit
of
guava
added
in
and
well
maybe
they
overdid
the
guava
ive
already
said
what
there
is
to
say
about
this
one
very
disappointed
i
would
avoid
this
cheers
the
beer
is
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
chalice
the
aroma
is
simply
wonderful
a
bouquet
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
fantastic
well
balanced
with
a
subtle
yeasty
quality
feels
great
on
the
palate
overall
a
terrific
beer
and
something
i
would
really
enjoy
having
again
overall
this
is
a
real
winner
really
hope
they
keep
producing
it
pours

at

good
job
cc
o
awesome
beer
the
exceeded
my

guava
and
tropical

follow
to

extent
which
add
some
sweetness
to
counter
the
tart
start
some
wheat
and
spice
are
up
next
to
a
much
lesser
extent
than
your
average
saison
finishes
mellow
with
a
combination
of
tartness
and
guava
o
a
good
first
saison
for
me
very
interesting
and
unique
flavor
that
i
will
aboslutely
be
revisiting
in
the
future
a
very
tasty
brew
indeed
this
beer
kind
of
reminded
me
of
my
great
uncles
homemade
hard
cider
the
aroma
was
super
tart
smelling
and
acidic
the
flavor
was
a
little
tart
but
mostly
sweet
very
surprising
to
say
the
least
the
afterteaste
is
is
fruity
kinda
like
a
soft
peach
flavor
the
appearance
is
rather
nice
too
its
this
orange
color
that
looks
appealing
with
a
nice
lacy
head
an
interesting
brew
without
a
doubt
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
light
lacy
head
smells
of
tart
fruit
and
tastes
just
the
same
guava
bananas
little
bit
of
flowery
hops
slightly
tart
but
nicely
balanced
by
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
background
great
example
of
a
saison
with
some
fruitiness
to
balance
it
out
d
maybe
not
an
entirely
traditional
version
of
a
saison
but
a
interesting
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
overall
this
is
one
tasty
saison
the
guava
plays
well
with
the
base
beer
and
it
goes
down
easy
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
if
you
like
some
sweetness
or
fruit
presence
in
your
saisons
hopefully
i
can
get
a
taste
of
the
jolly
guava
sometime
in
the
near
future
tremendous
sour
beer
i
just
hope
they
can
produce
more
of
this
to
make
it
a
flagship
beer
d
for
how
tart
this
beer
is
the
underlying
sweetness
makes
it
easily
drinkable
the
crisp
and
dry
finish
is
quite
enjoyable
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
at
an
appropriate
level
very
nice
d
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
very
delicious
beer
unexpected
tartness
combined
with
a
good
but
not
overdone
fruit
flavor
seek
this
out
this
is
definitely
a
strange
beer
i
get
the
feeling
this
is
quite
variable
from
batch
to
batch
the
acetic
acidity
is
a
bit
out
of
place
even
though
it
is
relatively
soft
actually
a
lactic
tartness
would
have
worked
really
nice
here
and
would
have
been
more
in
line
with
the
other
saison
notes
this
beer
is
certainly
enjoyable
but
the
acetic
and
the
viscous
body
make
this
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
the
type
of
saisons
that
i
usually
prefer
dry
some
times
lactic
tart
the
viscous
character
must
be
coming
from
the
guava
or
some
wild
bug
the
label
is
certainly
correct
in
that
this
beer
has
some
unique
flavors
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
sour
and
tart
flavors
mixed
very
well
together
and
helped
balance
each
other
i
really
liked
the
fruity
guava
flavors
it
had
very
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
this
evening
this
is
my
first
rating
with
the
new
overall
rating
system
overall
this
one
obliterates
o
one
of
my
favorite
cigar
city
beers
and
one
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
a
rather
high
abv
d
i
enjoyed
this
i
dont
think
it
held
many
characteristics
of
a
saison
but
found
this
to
be
a
good
sour
o
i
love
this
beer
anyone
want
to
trade
for
one
wish
this
was
distributed
in
ca
a
very
unique
saison
which
works
far
better
than
it
should
i
might
expect
something
like
this
from
fantôme
in
fact
though
the
yeast
is
a
bit
more
restrainedcommercial
by
comparison
in
this
beer
very
much
worth
tracking
down
for
lovers
of
the
style
who
want
something
originaldifferent
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
reminded
me
more
of
a
sour
then
anything
very
good
would
definitely
get
another
bottle
to
have
in
the
summer
mouthd
sour
stinky
bright
and
shiny
guavaed
lemons
taffy
and
grapefruitish
wowowowowow
i
could
drink
this
all
day
goes
right
to
the
cheeks
quite
malty
up
there
in
carbonation
bubble
gummy
all
things
that
are
good
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
excessively
carbonated
and
very
prickly
on
the
tongue
the
bubbly
aspect
of
this
brew
is
fitting
for
the
style
but
kick
it
back
dialed
down
a
bit
would
be
great
the
8
abv
in
this
brew
is
honestly
not
hidden
at
all
it
packs
a
punch
like
it
is
swinging
at
a
level
above
10
overall
this
brew
is
a
winner
its
interesting
and
enjoyable
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
however
naturalists
of
the
style
might
forsee
the
guavas
contribution
as
unwelcomed
or
taboo
d
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
easy
to
drink
and
could
serve
as
a
seguegateway
into
the
wonderful
world
of
sours
pours
a
hazed
orange
gold
color
big
plume
of
prickly
white
bubbles
good
retention
and
lacing
first
whiff
brings
sweet
watery
and
puply
guava
touches
of
other
fruit
souch
as
apricot
and
papaya
a
bold
sour
and
tart
funkyness
unexpected
hints
of
dried
hay
light
spicing
and
yeast
first
quality
noted
in
the
sip
is
the
somewhat
strong
tart
sour
and
funky
acidic
quality
the
guava
is
still
the
star
but
the
presentation
here
has
me
questioning
saison
as
the
label
states
while
not
as
strong
as
say
a
cascade
sour
still
a
balance
of
sweet
pulpy
and
watery
fruit
and
a
funky
tart
and
sourness
star
and
overshadow
much
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
i
want
to
stress
all
this
is
said
in
a
good
way
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
coating
and
slightly
lingering
on
the
palate
again
not
as
i
expected
lightly
fruited
and
delicately
funky
saison
but
a
pleasent
suprise
i
like
the
beer
in
general
drinks
way
easy
and
has
nice
dry
fruit
flavors
i
am
a
bit
snobby
with
my
saisons
as
i
like
to
taste
some
yeasty
goodness
this
beer
really
doesnt
display
that
with
that
said
very
crisp
and
clean
beer
very
enjoyable
d
when
i
saw
this
at
deciccos
i
was
intrigued
but
was
not
going
to
buy
it
when
i
talked
to
one
of
the
guys
there
he
recommended
it
and
said
it
was
like
nothing
else
he
did
not
speak
untruths
this
really
is
a
singular
beer
the
guava
works
so
well
with
the
saison
to
bring
out
all
those
fruity
esters
i
am
still
stuck
on
the
yeast
one
sip
screams
fantome
then
the
next
something
less
obvious
like
a
us
saison
yeast
with
a
bret
secondary
really
well
balanced
a
must
try
d
for
8
abv
it
drinks
like
a

beer
this
would
be
an
awesome
food

with
some
funky

tones
as
well
a

tart
wheaty

out
some
of
the
richness
belgianlike
effervescent
mouthfeel
soft
and
slightly

texture
big
and
rather
brutal
at
times
with
its

pungency
this
is
completely
original
and
uniqiue
a
very
interesting
beer
as
i
got
into
the
bottle
it
became
more
challenging
and
jowelwatering
a
sipper
for
sure
dont
know
if
the
sourness
was
intentional
but
its
a
bit
over
the
top
the
fruit
character
is
nice
but
not
screaming
guava
had
brought
out
a
plate
of
maytag
bleu
midnight
moon
goat
cheese
some
raspberry
jam
and
rum
soaked
dates
with
small
dish
of
crackers
the
earthy
mouldy
nuances
of
the
beer
and
the
bleu
cheese
and
raspberry
jam
went
wonderfully
together
drinkable
in
the
sense
of
wanting
one
again
just
not
immediately
d
while
extremely
novel
think
flemish
sour
apple
saison
the
profile
carries
a
lot
of
flavors
that
just
didnt
sit
well
on
my
palate
d
good
overall
i
was
surprised
by
the
tartness
in
this
i
suppose
i
shouldnt
have
since
it
is
a
saison
the
fruit
is
mellow
but
noticeable
and
not
artificial
i
dont
know
what
this
beer
is
or
where
it
fits
but
i
dont
really
feel
like
it
falls
into
the
category
of
saison
the
bitter
taste
hit
me
right
away
with
a
hard
carbination
follow
which
faded
fast
and
left
a
silky
guava
taste
its
not
as
fruity
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
am
a
little
let
down
by
that
if
i
could
get
over
the
initial
bitter
taste
id
like
it
so
much
more
i
might
be
off
in
saying
this
but
i
feel
it
borders
on
a
sour
d
its
delicious
now
but
i
can
see
it
gettin
heavy
towards
the
end
glad
i
have
someone
to
share
it
with
drinkability
is
pretty
good
hides
most
of
its
alcohol
interesting
fruity
character
a
cool
funky
and
fruity
saison
just
the
slightest
of
haze
in
the
bronze
colored
liquid
a
very
thin
head
forms
and
quickly
goes
away
not
much
for
lacing
looks
like
it
suffers
from
a
lack
of
carbonation
very
interesting
aroma
a
combination
of
tart
and
spice
the
guava
is
readily
apparent
along
with
hints
of
tropical
fruit
the
flavor
was
not
as
impressive
a
little
tartness
upfront
with
plenty
of
fruit
flavors
finishes
with
some
spice
notes
the
saison
gets
a
bit
lost
under
the
fruit
the
body
suffers
from
very
low
carbonation
feels
thin
as
well
i
like
a
little
bit
more
life
out
of
this
style
besides
the
carbonation
issues
the
flavor
just
did
not
click
with
me
that
is
something
carbonation
is
not
going
to
fix
overall
impression
i
didnt
really
pick
up
a
whole
lot
of
guava
but
this
was
pretty
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
unique
and
in
a
really
good
way
i
could
easily
sip
on
this
for
an
entire
night
and
think
it
would
be
great
to
enjoy
in
the
summertime
as
i
feel
it
would
be
very
refreshing
with
all
of
these
fruity
flavors
going
on
a
bit
more
sour
than
a
regular
saison
but
still
pretty
tasty
for
some
reason
mike
kept
on
calling
this
thing
guava
groove
honestly
like
him
i
think
its
a
slightly
better
name
it
pours
a
cloudy
earthy
amber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
blood
orange
the
smell
set
off
some
of
my
taste
buds
lemon
grapefruit
and
a
mild
helping
of
brett
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
mandarin
oranges
a
vague
tropical
fruit
that
we
all
agree
must
be
the
guava
ive
never
had
one
so
i
dont
know
what
it
necessarily
tastes
like
then
a
wave
of
brine
and
vinegar
and
then
nothing
the
flavors
just
die
away
leaving
my
tongue
wondering
what
the
hell
just
happened
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
an
active
carbonation
and
an
incredibly
dry
finish
overall
what
could
have
been
a
really
nice
experimental
brew
turned
out
to
be
a
slight
miss
the
saltiness
near
the
end
the
disappearance
of
any
and
all
flavor
at
the
end
and
the
overt
carbonation
all
turned
me
off
im
not
a
fan
here
this
beer
appears
a
cloudy
burnt
sienna
with
a
white
foam
adorning
the
surface
this
beer
is
nice
and
fizzy
which
truly
helps
the
smell
of
this
beer
has
the
tropical
fruit
aroma
from
a
distance
though
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
guava
i
probably
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
seeing
as
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
fruit
in
my
life
there
is
some
lemon
and
funk
to
go
along
with
it
has
the
smell
of
older
applewine
the
taste
is
a
spicy
fun
light
tart
flavor
i
think
its
a
rather
pleasant
sour
when
you
are
prepared
for
it
due
to
the
tartness
only
being
involved
with
fruit
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
but
the
higher
level
of
carbonation
gives
an
almost
champagne
like
feel
to
the
beer
i
thought
i
might
not
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
truly
did
overall
i
would
recommend
cigar
city
brewings
guava
grove
saison
for
anyone
seeking
a
uniquely
enjoyable
and
bold
take
on
the
traditional
saison
granted
my
saison
experience
is
limited
but
if
they
all
taste
this
good
im
going
to
need
more
drinkability
typical
drinkability
for
your
average
saison
d
first
cigar
city
that
i
really
liked
it
has
this
complex
multi
tropical
fruit
taste
notes
that
a
brew
from
a
hot
climate
location
should
have
its
balanced
for
all
thats
going
on
finally
i
at
least
understand
the
legion
of
cc
fans
and
its
their
beer
that
i
look
for
in
the
future
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
especially
for
the
sour
fan
i
think
people
who
like
some
good
balance
in
a
puckering
sour
would
appreciate
this
the
most
me
not
being
the
best
judge
of
sours
still
thought
it
was
a
solid
brew
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
kind
of
reminds
me
of
raspberry
tart
blended
with
a
monster
energy
drink
and
hints
of
wine
that
probably
is
not
the
best
comparison
but
first
things
that
pop
in
my
mind
when
i
taste
this
had
another
bottle
with
date
4202011
on
it
this
time
around
it
had
way
more
saison
character
and
a
very
healthy
dose
of
spiciness
from
the
yeast
nose
was
full
of
pepper
and
clove
as
well
as
fruity
esters
coupled
with
a
beautiful
real
guava
scent
that
had
sweet
and
tart
character
to
it
much
drier
and
way
less
tart
than
i
remember
taste
actually
had
a
lot
more
going
on
and
seemed
a
bit
more
like
saison
to
me
still
a
fantastic
beer
drinkability
2
5
huge
funky
and
fruit
flavors
make
this
beer
quite
tasty
but
not
that
drinkable
half
of
the
magnum
was
enough
for
me
right
now
but
id
definitely
have
it
again
doddly
enough
i
found
this
to
be
a
drink
hard
to
put
down
something
about
the
taste
i
feel
it
slowly
became
more
loveable
as
the
drink
went
on
im
sure
glad
i
drank
all
750ml
of
this
bottle
with
out
help
this
is
the
first
sourish
beer
that
struck
my
heart
in
this
way
maybe
itll
be
a
gateway
of
some
sort
to
more
sours
it
was
a
big
expensive
bottle
but
i
hope
to
buy
more
at
some
point
tartness
came
at
our
noses
right
when
the
cap
was
popped
hazed
orange
amber
with
some
light
sudsy
action
big
fruity
tart
aroma
with
a
quick
pull
of
malt
in
the
back
modest
smoothness
was
expecting
crispness
tartness
wants
to
put
the
boot
to
the
throat
but
pulls
back
quick
enough
to
unveil
a
unqiue
fruitiness
the
guava
jumps
up
and
does
a
crazy
wave
at
the
palate
with
both
hands
malt
and
yeast
clutch
each
other
with
a
nutty
earthy
lovely
mess
alcohol
warmth
in
the
back
slowly
grows
in
the
dry
finish
some
controlled
chaos
that
grew
on
us
d
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
wouldnt
want
a
six
pack
but
the
bomber
is
great
and
i
would
drink
it
again
really
liking
the
brews
of

right
now
m
fizzy

i
found
this
to
be
a
really
nice
drinker
assertive
in

the
right
places
and
playful
in
all
the
rest
this
would
be

this
one

with

is
a

and
an
interesting
foray
into
brewing
its
simply
a
very
good
saison
with

but
its
a
very
nice
and
very
unique
take
on
the
style
i
am
excited
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
to
cellar
these
cigar

beers
arent
exactly
olfactory
delights
tart

certainly
an
enjoyable

the

aspects
of
the

are
pretty

im
a

of

but
not
ready
to
jump
into
the

bandwagon
just

cant

for
the

but
as

is
detected
in
the
nose
overall
a
good
offering
from
cigar
city
brewing
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
gunnermanjul

again
bread
taste
like
a
salad
kind
of
strange
they
definitely
nailed
with
the
cucumber
part
of
this
but
thats
really
it
the
flavor
to
me
was
more
like
a
light
ale
with
pickles
had
this
beer
from
a
bomber
recently
and
back
in
2012
so
i
will
try
to
bridge
the
two
tastings
then
it
had
overwhelming
tastes
and
smells
of
cucumber
also
rather
creamy
perhaps
too
much
and
not
much
crispness
or
hop
now
in
2015
this
beer
definitely
mellowed
out
however
that
could
be
because
i
drank
it
over
six
months
after
its
bottling
date
not
intentionally
fyi
cucumber
flavor
and
smell
was
still
there
but
not
as
much
as
before
and
still
quite
a
good
beer
also
seemed
more
hoppy
and
carbonated
to
the
point
where
there
was
a
massive
head
even
after
a
slow
pour
i
think
this
style
and
flavor
of
beer
is
a
fantastic
idea
but
needs
some
tweaking
like
some
sort
of
twisted
beer
stockholm
syndrome
i
want
my
over
the
top
cucumber
flavor
back
too
much
cucumber
taste
for
me
but
its
a
nice
beer
for
sure
i
wanted
to
hate
this
but
wow
like
a
pickle
but
blends
into
a
beer
nicely
probably
not
really
a
saison
but
very
interesting
and
wellputtogether
all
their
beers
are
so
well
made
its
not
my
style
but
makes
an
amazing
bloody
mary
back
saisons
are
alright
however
this
one
is
terrible
pours
light
golden
with
thin
white
head
the
cucumber
smell
and
taste
are
very
potent
also
tastes
of
wheat
and
light
yeast
flavor
the
cucumber
with
alcohol
almost
gives
a
light
dry
pickle
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
nice
and
refreshing
excellent
summer
beer
gross
drain
pour
times
five
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
be
a
fan
but
this
was
a
lot
of
fun
the
cucumber
was
not
overpowering
but
had
just
the
right
balance
to
make
it
goo
pours
a
clear
deep
golden
color
the
aroma
is
like
that
of
dill
pickles
the
taste
is
also
very
cucumber
forward
with
pickle
like
flavor
and
a
small
dry
yeast
in
the
finish
hard
to
get
much
grains
in
the
taste
over
the
pickle
light
bodied
ale
that
would
drink
easy
if
it
tasted
better
overall
this
is
not
good
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
feature
cucumber
flavor
although
it
unfortunately
comes
across
as
past
its
prime
nice
mix
of
sweet
tart
and
bitter
components
until
the
aftertaste
which
is
a
tad
overly
bitter
tmo
taste
is
also
all
about
cucumber
i
am
not
a
crazy
cucumber
person
bit
this
is
really
well
done
and
actually
quite
tasty
good
balance
with
sweetness
easy
drinking
with
a
crisp
feel
very
refreshing
not
terribly
saisony
but
tons
and
tons
of
cucumber
for
sure
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
medium
high
carbonation
it
feels
heavier
because
i
think
my
tongue
is
expecting
to
be
chewing
cucumber
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
besides
the
cucumber
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
light
saison
the
cucumber
makes
it
interesting
for
me
and
i
enjoy
cucumber
so
i
like
that
aspect
to
it
would
definitely
drink
again
a
straightforward
saison
base
with
an
aroma
and
flavor
of
light
cucumber
the
base
beer
itself
is
light
and
simple
with
some
light
peppery
saison
yeast
character
foamy
carbonation
with
good
head
retention
lends
a
creamy
texture
no
obvious
flaws
the
cucumber
is
unique
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
i
think
it
pairs
well
with
spicy
dishes
but
overall
the
beer
isnt
very
interesting
im
thankful
i
got
to
try
this
overall
its
refreshing
and
the
cucumber
flavor
is
pretty
much
all
there
is
here
if
thats
your
thing
its
good
i
rather
enjoy
it
o
great
light
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
definite
cucumber
but
its
light
and
still
present
unlike
wicked
weeds
imperial
cucumber
in
that
theres
has
a
strong
and
in
the
face
melon
quality
bought
in
west
palm
beach
whole

drank

boca
raton
the
first
day
of
my
vacation
july
12
2014
not
for
everyone
you
definitely
get
the
cucumber
the
smell
reminds
me
of
my
mothers
kitchen
when
she
was
making
homemade
pickles
a
pleasant
smell
but
not
something
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
got
this
on
a
sampler
dont
think
i
could
do
an
entire
glass
ohhhh
god
smells
like
hippy
feet
and
a
salad
from
a
cheap
hotel
buffet
looks
like
miller
lite
tastes
like
cucumber
but
in
a
way
that
makes
me
hope
i
never
encounter
them
again
i
dont
know
what
they
were
thinking
when
they
brewed
this
but
i
wont
hold
it
against
them
bottle
poured
a
dirty
cloudy
beige
color
ale
with
a
super
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
of
cucumber
is
actually
quiet
dominant
with
some
peppery
yeast
notes
also
easily
identifiable
taste
is
dominated
by
cucumber
notes
with
loads
of
peppery
yeast
and
some
rustic
malt
notes
this
beer
is
really
dry
with
loads
of
attenuation
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
a
really
interesting
experience
but
cucumber
notes
are
a
bit
too
strong
to
withstand
large
quantities
of
this
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
would
share
gain
with
multiple
friends
one
of
the
more
unique
things
ive
encountered
has
more
cucumber
flavor
than
an
actual
cucumber
works
well
and
really
is
refreshing
the
sheer
quantity
of
cucumber
in
this
beer
deserves
some
kind
of
award
as
it
barely
makes
sense
if
you
dont
like
cucumber
you
are
going
to
hate
this
beer
fortunately
i
do
the
saison
base
is
either
very
mild
or
just
completely
dominated
by
the
cucumbers
regardless
its
worth
a
try
i
appreciate
the
interesting
qualities
of
this
brew
but
there
are
just
elements
missing
that
get
this
past
drinking
cucumber
water
beer
overall
cool
beer
cool
concept
however
follows
more
of
the
pickled
route
than
the
fresh
cucumber
route
most
likely
due
to
the
age
on
this
one
as
it
was
given
to
me
will
have
to
try
this
one
again
fresh
but
regardless
this
is
definitely
a
vegetable
beer
without
much
in
way
of
saison
qualities
i
am
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
because
i
think
its
a
nice
take
on
the
saison
style
and
it
reflects
florida
well
the
lemony
hope
qualities
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
cucumber
flavor
and
aroma
and
the
base
saison
is
strong
and
achieves
the
right
properties
to
differentiate
this
beer
overall
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
smells
good
the
carbonation
just
kind
of
kills
it
for
me
probably
the
only
cigar
city
brew
i
have
not
loved
o
my
girlfriend
picked
this
up
for
me
in
florida
i
was
eager
to
try
it
i
expected
overwhelming
cucumber
it
was
prominent
but
not
overwhelming
i
liked
the
lemon
and
honey
flavors
they
complimented
the
cucumber
giving
this
beer
a
refreshing
quality
i
probably
would
not
drink
this
all
the
time
but
it
made
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
it
also
was

well

flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
as
a
vegetable
beer
this
hits
the
mark
the
cucumber
dominates
both
the
nose
and
the
flavor
profile
however
as
a
saison
this
beer
fails
instead
of
the
cucumber
complementing
the
saison
characteristics
it
instead
dominates
id
dial
down
the
cucumber
addition
by
at
least
20
in
order
to
get
a
more
balanced
brew
o
interesting
but
still
clean
and
refreshing
a
nice
take
on
a
saison
oeasily
better
than
the
flat
12
cucumber
beer
still
not
sure
if
cucumbers
belong
in
beer
but
this
one
at
least
is
enjoyable
super
cucumber
flavor
and
aroma
that
blends
in
nicely
with
the
base
farmhouse
yeast
pours
almost
gushes
a
pale
gold
with
a
monstrous
white
head
that
fades
slowly
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
lives
up
to
the
name
like
a
freshly
sliced
cucumber
some
spice
notes
waft
through
with
a
slight
whiff
of
honey
taste
more
subdued
than
aroma
but
cucumber
and
pepper
are
the
first
notes
followed
by
a
nice
malt
backbone
finishes
dry
and
spicy
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
it
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
that
make
this
a
good
summer
beer
overall
a
well
crafted
and
refreshing
quaff
good
job
cigar
city
in
what
may
be
the
biggest
surprise
ive
experienced
lately
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
good
despite
my
aversion
to
cucumbers
o
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
needs
to
be
at
the
perfect
temp
to
enjoy
otherwise
it
can
get
to
taste
almost
medicinal
o
see
above
im
glad
i
had
this
and
i
might
be
able
to
slam
this
on
a
hot
day
its
so
cucumbery
and
refreshing
but
its
also
a
cucumber
beer
so
again
the
jury
remains
out
i
will
say
id
like
to
have
another
to
further
feel
it
out
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
its
not
your
typical
saison
theres
lots
of
earthiness
but
in
more
of
a
cucumberfresh
vegetablegarden
way
a
very
refreshing
beer
much
like
cucumber
water
at
a
spa
is
very
refreshing
well
its
a
cucumber
beer
but
im
not
as
convinced
that
its
a
saison
i
like
it
mostly
based
on
how
it
present
the
cucumber
i
want
more
saison
though
o
wow
there
is
plenty
of
cucumber
unfortunately
its
seems
far
to
ripe
when
i
slice
a
cucumber
for
a
salad
or
sandwich
it
isnt
this
pungent
carbonation
level
is
very
high
makes
it
somewhat
difficult
to
taste
the
beer
while
cold
after
some
warmth
it
is
refreshing
reminds
me
of
goose
islands
sofie
doesnt
have
enough
lemon
and
i
constantly
keep
thinking
of
my
lotion
do
i
really
really
like
cucumbers
nope
but
do
i
really
like
this
beer
yes
it
is
light
refreshing
and
crisp
it
appears
golden
and
hazy
smells
of
citrus
and
cucumber
taste
is
of
a
nice
saison
some
light
fruit
and
the
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
of
cucumber
really
will
clean
the
palate
and
could
an
amazing
in
between
beer
if
it
was
available
in
6packs
i
only
found
it
in
a
750ml
would
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
out
by
the
pool
any
and
every
hot
day
of
the
year
got
this
bottle
in
a
beer
trade
and
was
very
excited
to
try
it
finally
the
beer
poured
a
beautiful
light
see
through
yellow
with
hints
of
green
in
it
it
smelled
like
a
fresh
vegetable
garden
i
dont
care
if
i
was
about
to
drink
a
beer
the
smell
is
crazy
fun
however
upon
tasting
it
you
are
literally
drinking
water
from
a
fancy
restaurant
with
cucumber
in
it
there
is
a
lot
of
complexities
to
this
beer
but
the
cucumber
is
quite
powerful
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
cucumber
beware
as
if
the
name
didnt
give
it
away
the
beer
is
however
very
light
crisp
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
just
how
a
sasion
should
be
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
guy
not
for
me
but
a
fun
unique
beer
for
sure
o
drink
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
since
my
feeling
is
that
the
fresh
refreshing
quality
is
what
sets
this
one
apart
from
so
many
other
saisons
on
the
market
750
ml
bottle
from
abc
liquors
in
oviedo
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
very
slight
haze
and
a
medium
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
medium
with
cucumbers
peanuts
and
more
cucumbers
papaya
honey
and
pepper
the
taste
like
the
aroma
features
lots
of
cucumbers
a
tangy
lemon
bitterness
that
settles
quickly
into
a
grassy
finish
just
enough
malt
to
keep
the
beer
actually
tasting
like
a
beer
the
palate
was
light
and
fizzy
a
very
dry
finish
invites
you
back
more
more
swallows
the
taste
of
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
i
found
it
very
refreshing
and
unique
i
have
come
to
expect
nothing
less
from
this
very
creative
brewery
t
again
tons
and
tons
of
cucumber
the
taste
hits
right
away
and
carries
through
every
single
part
of
this
beer
a
bit
of
sour
pickle
flavor
in
the
middle
before
a
finish
thats
all
cucumber
slight
hints
of
grain
and
wheat
but
again
this
is
definitely
a
cucumber
beer
mouthfeel
is
slick
a
little
oily
and
may
be
just
a
touch
heavy
for
this
in
small
amounts
this
is
awesome
theres
really
no
saison
here
but
as
a
cucumber
beer
this
is
really
cool
to
try
frankly
this
is
a
beer
meant
to
be
paired
with
food
in
the
right
context
this
beer
would
simply
wow
many
people
cucumber
saison
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
light
straw
hued
edges
there
is
visible
carbonation
rising
up
through
the
beer
into
the
large
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
muted
by
the
large
head
and
it
seems
relatively
modest
even
once
the
cap
is
cleared
and
it
is
allowed
to
warm
a
little
bit
the
smell
is
full
of
cucumber
skin
light
grains
and
a
bit
of
peppery
saison
yeast
the
flavor
is
over
the
top
cucumber
even
though
the
flavor
is
nice
it
is
simple
and
really
destroys
any
chance
of
complexity
there
could
be
to
this
beer
light
grains
and
notes
of
pepper
add
a
little
bit
of
depth
a
slight
vaguely
vegetable
note
comes
in
at
the
end
the
finish
is
still
more
cucumber
the
body
is
a
bit
fuller
than
i
usually
expect
from
a
saison
but
it
is
still
on
the
light
side
overall
the
carbonation
has
a
light
creaminess
to
it
but
overall
is
crisp
and
smooth
to
say
this
is
an
interesting
beer
is
an
understatement
very
very
unusual
and
cucumber
plays
a
starring
role
here
very
strongly
present
now
thats
a
good
thing
if
you
really
really
really
like
cucumber
otherwise
i
like
it
well
enough
in
the
aroma
it
lends
a
crisp
almost
floral
note
with
a
residual
creamy
vegetal
nose
the
taste
is
just
too
much
cucumber
though
i
have
palate
fatigue
after
12
of
a
glass
and
im
craving
something
more
a
blast
of
white
pepper
some
sourness
a
heavy
herbalness
anything
to
break
the
unrelenting
cucumber
assault
a
bit
too
slick
on
the
palate
as
well
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
what
surprised
me
was
how
this
beer
was
actually
pretty
drinkable
given
that
i
am
not
usually
a
big
fans
of
saisons
or
vegetable
presence
in
beer
with
that
said
this
beer
could
be
substantially
improved
by
not
trying
to
bash
the
drinker
over
the
head
with
the
cucumber
flavor
succeeding
as
a
mindlessly
drinkable
beer
does
not
translate
well
into
a
high
rating
i
was
leery
of
this
one
i
mean
cucumber
really
figured
it
would
be
too
light
or
overwhelming
wrong

its
not
as
dry
as
i
like
a
saison
but
its
deff
a
thirst
quencher
nice
brew
for
this
ungodly
hot
day
in
florida
overall
a
weird
beer
allaround
definitely
an
experience
worth
having
but
i
certainly
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
drink
another
of
these
anytime
soon
also
like
any
novelty
a
dab
will
do
you
this
would
be
a
good
splitting
beer
bottle
poured
to
tall
tulip
cloudy
light
golden
pour
with
a
big
fluffy
head
aroma
of
cucumbers
gym
shoe
spice
yeast
more
funk
light
fruit
most
funk
i
have
ever
smelled
very
interesting
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
following
wave
of
cucumber
then
a
really
dirty
dusty
finish
this
thing
is
nice
until
that
staleness
light
mouthfeel
and
big
carbo
i
just
cannot
deal
with
this
aftertaste
so
refreshing
to
start
and
them
just
nasty
unfortunate
as
i
really
enjoyed
the
cucumber
lager
blah
cant
finish
this
and
hope
it
is
just
a
bad
bottle
o
certainly
unique
and
very
enjoyable
in
the
aroma
but
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
not
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
vegetable
beer
or
any
other
style
confusing
and
interesting
at
first
sip
the
cucumber
hits
you
much
harder
than
anything
else
after
a
few
sips
however
those
saison
spices
and
dryness
begin
to
blend
in
a
little
bit
better
at
first
sip
i
wasnt
sure
that
i
wanted
to
drink
22
oz
of
it
alone
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
that
bomber
i
admittedly
wanted
a
little
bit
more
overall
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
saisony
extremely
fresh
bottle
cucumber
saison
is
a
beer
that
completely
delivers
on
half
of
its
name
saison
not
so
much
but
if
youre
in
the
market
for
cucumber
this
is
the
beer
for
you
unlike
magic
hats
new
hicu
this
is
not
a
complete
cucumber
bomb
instead
it
offers
a
nice
mellow
cucumber
aroma
and
flavor
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
pilsneresque
malt
backbone
theres
a
very
slight
touch
of
yeast
spiciness
but
its
kept
in
check
very
well
cucumber
saison
is
an
excellent
vegetable
beer
realistic
flavor
without
being
overpowering
this
is
a
winner
just
dont
expect
much
in
the
way
of
saison
flavors
at
least
when
as
fresh
as
this
bottle
is
bottled
last
friday
perhaps
more
time
brings
out
more
saison
aspects
but
in
the
end
i
rather
enjoyed
the
beer
i
wanted
the
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
of
cucumber
to
show
up
in
its
most
vibrant
and
perfumy
scent
but
what
i
got
was
pickle
relish
though
i
like
it
on
those
ballpark
hot
dogs
its
presence
in
my
beer
glass
is
slightly
misplaced
even
though
the
base
saison
has
much
to
celebrate
cost
10
for
a
750
ml
bottle
cucumber
saison
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
novel
beers
i
have
every
had
as
one
sampler
stated
it
is
like
vegetable
juice
and
beer
poured
from
the
glass
the
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
cucumber
is
the
most
noticeable
element
in
the
aroma
in
the
initial
taste
was
cucumber
cucumber
peal
a
little
straw
and
salt
if
you
have
ever
been
to
a
restaurant
that
serves
cucumber
slices
in
their
glasses
of
water
this
should
give
you
some
perspective
the
aftertaste
is
dry
which
is
the
most
saisonlike
element
of
this
beer
the
funkiness
of
a
saison
seems
to
have
been
cancelled
out
by
the
cucumber
it
was
an
interesting
beer
but
probably
not
one
i
need
to
have
again
oits
a
solid
brew
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
before
who
even
comes
up
with
something
like
this
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
something
wonderful
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
i
suggest
you
find
a
bottle
of
this
unless
you
have
a
thing
against
the
vegetable
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
fairly
nice
beer
i
was
rather
curious
about
it
when
i
learned
of
it
and
sought
on
out
especially
for
my
wife
whom
likes
both
samsons
and
cucumbers
but
ended
up
hating
this
beer
i
on
the
other
hand
enjoyed
the
combination
of
the
cucumber
along
with
the
lemon
tartness
and
yeasty
spice
giving
this
one
a
salad
in
a
glass
feel
to
it
while
still
retaining
its
beeriness
o
ill
be
upfront
at
the
end
how
ironic
with
the
fact
i
dont
like
cucumbers
theyre
best
served
as
pickles
in
my
opinion
but
i
went
into
the
review
open
minded
i
wont
lie
the
aroma
scared
me
into
thinking
my
wife
a
cucumber
lover
would
be
drinking
the
vast
majority
of
this
bottle
but
cigar
city
did
a
fantastic
job
with
this
beer
like
a
cucumber
this
saison
has
a
heavy
nose
thats
lighter
in
flavor
letting
more
saison
through
its
incredibly
authentic
and
the
comparison
of
the
cucumbers
crispness
with
the
saison
is
a
wonderful
pairing
i
still
may
not
like
cucumbers
but
i
can
get
behind
this
unique
saison
and
say
its
one
wellcrafted
beer

large

cucumber
dominates
the
aroma
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
with
tropical
fruit
and
bealgian
yeast
undertones
the
cucumber
flavor
isnt
too
strong
but
also
dominates
but
has
a
musty
belgian

breads
cream

hint
of
tropical

medium

much
better
tha
i
was
expecting
wouldnt
necessarily
have
again
but
a
must
try
at
least
once
mildly
hazy
but
brilliantly
golden
in
the
light
half
inch
white
cap
that
diminished
to
a
fine
lace
of
bubbles
shortly
after
the
pour
crisp
refreshing
aroma
this
is
essentially
a
freshly
cut
cucumber
in
my
saison
juicy
light
and
the
faintest
grassiness
still
has
a
good
saison
background
though
dry
finish
nicely
carbonated
very
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
a
unique
and
quality
offering
from
ccb
o
shockingly
good
this
could
make
me
enjoy
cucumber
a
lot
more
well
played
cigar
city
this
would
be
fantastic
in
the
summer
time
a
wonderful
cucumber
drink
but
an
uninteresting
saison
on
tap
at
churchkey
served
in
a
mini
snifter
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
maybe
a
touch
of
cucumber
thats
unfortunately
theres
the
only
place
with
just
a
touch
of
cucumber
the
nose
smells
like
cucumber
juice
it
tastes
like
cucumber
water
light
body
no
real
beer
character
it
says
saison
but
i
dont
get
any
sort
of
pilsner
or
bready
malt
nor
is
there
anything
indicating
saison
yeast
just
cucumber
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
its
not
beer
o
this
is
a
really
unique
albeit
totally
accurate
saison
infused
with
cucumbers
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
farmhouse
ales
or
cucumbers
for
that
matter
but
if
you
like
either
its
def
worth
a
try
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
down
it
is
not
just
distinctive
and
unique
it
is
a
flatout
delicious
beer
and
testament
to
the
creativity
of
american
craft
brewing
mouthfeelis
very
light
and
crispy
medium
bodied
pretty
fizzy
as
well
i
found
the
cucumber
its
in
the
flavor
i
get
a
nice
which
i
hardly
describe
this
as
nice
grainy
flavor
followed
by
that
cucumber
freshness
it
actually
tastes
pretty
unique
and
its
kind
of
amazing
well
balanced
moderately
high
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
with
a
little
slickness
to
it
not
too
bad
i
may
not
try
it
again
but
im
glad
i
did
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
i
wouldnt
buy
often
a
bit
more
novelty
than
anything
else
but
thumbs
up
to
cigar
city
for
featuring
a
nontraditional
ingredient
and
getting
it
to
come
across
clearly
in
the
final
product
pours
a
hazy
straw
colored
yellow
with
a
fizzy
one
and
a
half
finger
fizzy
head
the
head
recedes
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
foam
cap
with
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
a
fairly
delicate
aroma
of
farmhouse
yeast
grass
light
citrus
spice
and
not
surprisingly
accents
of
cucumber
lemongrass
light
citrus
accents
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
farmhouse
yeast
joined
midpalate
by
refreshing
cucumber
finishes
dry
with
slight
cucumber
skinlike
bitterness
light
bodied
fizzy
but
subtle
carbonation
very
impressive
beer
although
enjoyed
on
an
unseasonably
warm
80
degree
fall
day
in
chicago
this
certainly
is
an
exceptional
summer
lawnmower
beer
recommended
overall
well
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
and
while
i
like
cucumbers
and
i
like
pickles
i
didnt
much
care
for
them
in
a
beer
my
scores
are
higher
than
otherwise
out
of
respect
for
the
creativity
okay
cucumber
really
all
right
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
topped
by
a
little
over
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
cucumber
and
mild
clove
wow
the
cucumbers
really
prevalent
but
it
doesnt
really
overpower
you
right
on
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
as
though
a
beer
was
somehow
made
to
taste
like
a
more
complex
flavorful
glass
of
cucumber
water
the
cuke
comes
through
a
tad
sweeter
than
usual
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
refreshing
finish
overall
i
was
skeptical
about
the
potential
success
of
this
stuff
but
it
turned
out
to
be
highly
enjoyable
go
figure
o
cucumber
is
there
for
sure
interesting
i
hate
cucumbers
but
this
one
was
ok
o
this
reminds
me
of
cucumber
water
you
might
have
at
a
southern
wedding
its
light
crisp
refreshing
definitely
delivers
m
light
body
moderate
carbonation
o
being
someone
who
loves
cucumbers
and
enjoys
saisons
this
was
a
must
try
for
me
great
aroma
and
pretty
tasty
but
i
would
have
liked
a
more
traditional
saison
flavor
base
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
and
id
certainly
recommend
simple
quick
direct
ive
disliked
cucumbers
since
i
was
a
thirtytwo
week
embryo
now
my
wife
is
going
to
force
me
to
try
them
again
maybe
ill
like
them
another
instance
of
beer
changing
a
mans
life
very
good
beer
amber
colored
with
lots
of
white
foam
aromas
of
light
pickle
and
very
light
citrus
flavors
same
as
the
aromas
this
is
one
tasty
beer
that
screams
hot
dogs
or
hamburgers
to
go
with
it
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
a
great
cookout
beer
overall
this
beer
lived
up
to
its
name
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
dont
think
id
want
it
again
overall
a
fine
beer
and
certainly
one
to
try
avoid
if
you
dont
like
cucumber
because
this
beer
is
all
about
it
pretty
good
beer
except
the
cuke
goes
a
long
way
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
billowy
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
after
a
bit
and
a
smidgen
of
lace
color
is
a
a
hazy
amber
flavors
like
nose
cuke
really
dominates
and
offsets
all
the
other
qualities
body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
with
the
cuke
wasnt
so
assertive
not
a
repeater
diamonds
are
forever
o
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
think
of
it
as
the
refreshing
spa
beer
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
due
to
the
presence
and
flavor
of
the
cucumber
sessionable
and
a
beer
i
would
be
glad
to
try
again
o
i
really
found
this
to
be
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
because
the
cucumbers
are
well
incorporated
into
the
taste
unlike
gimmicky
beers
overall
a
surprising
successful
twist
on
a
saison
this
one
works
o
solid
saison
and
interesting
beer
that
had
a
few
beer
geeks
wanting
some
more
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
with
the
cucumber
adding
a
really
nice
element
to
the
beer
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
beer
completely
unlike
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
very
unique
a
great
beer
any
time
but
especially
one
that
would
be
awesome
in
the
summertime
it
has
been
said
this
is
a
salad
in
a
beer
bottle
and
i
completely
agree
if
you
have
the
chance
to
get
this
beer
dont
pass
on
it
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
very
well
integrated
here
and
the
cucumber
is
surprisingly
bold
i
think
this
was
an
interesting
idea
and
they
executed
it
fairly
well
its
worth
a
try
but
in
the
end
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
to
warrent
wanting
to
have
it
again
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
bold
the
cucumber
scent
is
my
wife
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
and
stated
outloud
while
i
was
drinking
this
that
she
smelled
cucumber
salad
i
like
seeing
low
abv
saisons
and
its
nice
to
see
some
different
experimentation
going
on
sometimes
it
doesnt
always
work
but
this
works
clean
flavors
with
enough
peppery
spice
to
keep
it
interesting
nothing
overpowers
and
i
feel
like
it
stood
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
shared
by
cassino
during
bross242s
sendoff
party
before
he
moves
will
miss
you
man
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cucumber
spices
and
earth
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cucumber
spice
earth
and
earthy
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
if
i
am
honest
here
i
really
like
cucumber
however
the
cucumber
in
this
brew
was
so
intense
that
it
was
almost
unnatural
my
guess
is
that
they
used
an
extract
on
this
brew
as
the
cucumber
isnt
know
for
being
too
strong
on
taste
for
the
most
part
while
im
glad
cigar
city
wanted
to
try
something
new
i
just
dont
think
the
cucumber
addition
was
the
right
choice
on
this
one
still
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
there
are
definitely
better
options
out
there
to
experiment
with
o
this
beer
delivered
exactly
like
i
hoped
and
expected
cucumber
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
i
love
cucumber
and
i
love
saisons
and
this
is
the
perfect
marriage
its
so
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
its
so
refreshing
i
thought
it
might
be
gimmicky
and
that
there
was
a
chance
it
would
be
weird
and
bad
but
its
really
well
done
id
need
for
there
to
be
more
complexity
to
score
it
higher
but
as
a
summertime
refresher
it
does
a
great
job
being
very
pleasant
in
its
simplicity
overall
ccb
made
an
awesome
cucumber
beer
probably
the
most
memorable
beer
that
i
have
drank
from
them
the
humble
cucumber
really
makes
a
crazy
awesome
saison
probably
the
best
saison
that
i
have
ever
drank
perfect
for
a
hot
day
i
could
drink
a
whole
750
myself
i
not
much
of
a
cuccumber
fan
but
when
you
put
it
in
beer
magic
happens
cigar
city
nailed
it
here
exactly
what
i
envisioned
when
i
first
heard
about
this
beer
cucumbers
who
wouldve
thought
of
it
in
beer
would
love
to
know
their
methods
if
you
like
cucumber
in
your
beer
yes
cigar
citys
cucumber
saison
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenrod
with
plenty
of
lemon
highlights
theres
just
about
four
fingers
of
frothy
white
foam
capping
the
beer
head
retention
is
very
good
and
while
theres
a
little
bit
of
lacing
there
could
definitely
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
more
amazingly
enough
cucumber
is
indeed
the
first
the
to
jump
out
as
i
take
in
the
aroma
theres
a
little
bit
of
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
present
as
well
but
thats
all
very
much
in
the
background
again
cucumber
is
the
centerpiece
of
the
flavor
profile
but
the
fruity
lemony
accents
from
the
citra
and
sorachi
ace
hops
are
a
little
more
present
here
in
fact
they
actually
are
a
little
too
loud
and
clash
a
bit
with
the
delicate
refreshing
flavor
of
the
cucumber
the
body
is
just
a
little
too
full
for
being
a
low
abv
saison
though
the
carbonation
attempts
to
sparkle
through
it
admirably
cucumber
is
definitely
on
the
list
of
ingredients
i
never
thought
id
see
in
a
beer
but
cigar
city
has
definitely
done
an
admirable
job
of
infusing
a
beer
with
cucumber
flavor
its
just
the
rest
of
the
recipe
thats
a
little
lacking
oh
god
so
much
cucumber
delicious
lemonyvegetal
freshly
sliced
cucumber
aroma
and
flavor
with
tiny
amounts
of
diacetyl
butter
that
makes
me
think
about
those
buttered
white
bread
cucumber
sandwiches
from
a
british
tea
lineup
the
beer
also
does
a
great
job
of
showcasing
the
way
that
melon
flavors
exist
within
cucumber
everything
is
framed
with
a
wheatlike
tartness
and
plenty
of
lemon
peel
a
light
and
sparkly
body
makes
it
drink
like
a
wine
spritzer
very
refreshing
and
unique
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
how
well
this
brew
works
but
it
does
tastes
of
you
guessed
it
cucumber
that
flavor
is
in
the
lead
here
so
far
living
up
to
its
name
now
its
just
a
matter
of
do
i
like
this
vegetables
flavor
in
a
beer
so
far
its
a
yay
when
i
wait
this
first
few
sips
out
im
tasting
peas
a
grassy
bite
with
an
abrupt
dry
finish
interesting
cool
this
is
my
first
cigar
city
beer
tried
picked
this
up
while
in
florida
the
shop
had
a
few
selections
from
this
brewery
and
i
chose
this
one
of
course
i
was
seeking
their
heralded
imperial
stout
to
no
avail
but
anyway
good
timing
as
this
was
july
when
bought
early
august
when
consumed
i
think
cigar
city
must
be
in
the
same
spirit
as
dfh
is
up
in
delaware
that
is
unique
effort
here
the
flavor
is
biting
pickly
and
everpresent
and
if
you
like
veggies
and
want
a
refreshing
adult
beverage
this
is
for
you
the
label
and
name
matched
the
taste
thank
you
chad
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
diminishes
at
a
steady
pace
scent
is
straight
up
cucumber
a
ton
of
freshcut
cucumber
with
a
light
salty
aroma
some
black
pepper
and
a
hint
of
mint
and
lemon
lacks
that
saison
funk
i
love
in
this
style
taste
is
not
nearly
as
cucumberforward
as
the
aroma
is
taste
is
more
saisonstyle
a
hint
of
cucumber
with
some
peppery
spice
and
light
butter
flavor
mellow
hops
with
some
earthy
flavors
very
refreshing
great
summer
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
disclaimer
i
hate
cucumbers
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
o
absolutely
fantastic
with
the
only
flaw
i
saw
being
the
appearance
pours
a
lightly
hazed
golden
straw
full
cap
of
prickly
white
bubbles
scent
brings
notes
of
cucumber
water
along
with
lightly
earthy
and
musty
dried
grain
cucumber
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
with
it
having
the
full
effect
on
the
tail
end
of
the
sip
light
spicing
along
with
mustyness
of
sasion
base
adds
a
light
pickling
note
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
dry
unique
beer
with
a
decent
cucumber
note
while
i
like
beverages
made
with
cucumber
and
celery
the
saison
added
a
touch
too
much
spice
throwing
off
the
cleanness
of
the
cucumber
o
an
odd
beer
worth
trying
if
you
want
something
different
but
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
nose
is
loaded
with
cucumber
and
pickle
wow
the
essence
of
cucumber
is
amazing
very
prominent
and
works
well
with
mild
saison
base
taste
is
cucumber
forward
feels
weird
saying
this
about
a
beer
and
very
refreshing
spicy
dill
comes
through
next
and
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
cool
brew
as
cool
as
a
nevermind
d
for
a
saison
this
is
quite
different
this
is
more
vegetable
beer
than
saison
if
you
want
a
low
abv
watery
cucumber
beer
youve
found
it
overall
best
fucking
summer
beer
ever
deliciously
refreshing
really
want
to
have
more
of
this
stuff
on
hand
it
is
too
damn
good
hopefully
they
make
this
a
yearly
seasonal
and
not
just
a
one
off
good
not
must
have
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
by
this
offering
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
cucumber
obviously
avoid
this
beer
but
this
was
quite
a
fun
interesting
flavor
profile
to
enjoy
in
a
saison
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
the
whole
750ml
by
myself
but
shared
with
a
friend
with
a
nice
light
summer
meal
why
not
the
aroma
is
very
cucumbery
with
a
touch
of
pickles
citrus
and
honey
the
appearance
is
light
honey
with
a
small
head
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
and
refreshing
overall
its
a
very
unique
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
but
im
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
its
like
drinking
a
cucumber
i
like
the
concept
and
how
they
pulled
it
off
o
very
unique
refreshing
and
complex
brew
perfect
for
the
hot
weather
and
highly
sessionable
nice
job
cigar
city
o
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
this
leaves
nothing
to
the
imagination
pure
cucumber
in
a
farmhouse
ale
its
definitely
a
summer
beer
light
and
refreshing
but
dont
think
i
could
have
it
all
the
time
i
would
recommend
this
especially
if
you
have
an
affinity
towards
interesting
different
beers
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
like
that
cigar
city
pushes
the
envelope
cucumber
is
not
something
i
typically
associate
with
beer
and
there
may
be
a
good
reason
for
that
that
said
its
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
o
i
am
not
really
a
huge
cucumber
fan
but
this
one
is
awesome
on
top
of
that
this
beer
is
actually
made
to
the
style
seek
out
o
very
interesting
effort
from
ccb
props
for
doing
something
a
bit
out
of
the
box
nice
not
something
that
i
will
search
out
more
of
though
o
overall
while
this
is
a
gimmicky
beer
it
is
a
damn
delicious
one
well
worth
the
4
pack
of
ht
it
took
to
get
to
try
this
delicious
unique
brew
that
is
a
shock
to
the
pallet
a
nice
crisp
summer
beer
that
is
very
different
this
is
about
as
well
executed
as
is
possible
for
this
idea
their
skill
is
certainly
on
display
but
why
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
cucumbers
water
and
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
malt
this
smells
like
i
think
it
would
if
you
ran
cucumbers
through
a
jack
lalanne
power
juicer
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
ton
of
cucumber
as
well
as
some
biscuit
malt
belgian
yeast
pepper
and
a
hint
of
lemon
and
orange
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
the
beer
was
green
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
focused
on
cucumber
as
an
unusual
ingredient
but
didnt
overwhelm
you
with
cucumberness
very
refreshing
another
triumph
for
cigar
city
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
and
lots
of
cucumber
aromas
taste
is
of
grain
cucumber
herbs
and
spices
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
really
spot
on
cucumber
aroma
and
taste
that
is
quite
interesting
if
your
looking
for
a
quality
saison
look
elsewhere
this
is
outside
of
the
box
thinking
and
experimental
brewing
which
i
do
applaud
at
times
but
i
dont
think
this
one
should
have
ever
left
the
tasting
room
id
take
their
guava
grove
or
table
saison
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
if
your
looking
for
liquid
salad
have
fun
but
making
a
cucumberlettucevodka
blend
will
give
you
the
same
effect
without
spending
12
for
750ml
hyped
up
yes
worth
investing
in
no
m
light
bodied
good
carbonation
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
two
finger
of
dense
white
foam
big
splotches
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
smell
holy
freakin
cucumbers
they
arent
playing
spicy
and
lemony
behind
that
wall
of
dimed
cucumbers
taste
cucumber
and
lemon
mildly
tangy
sugary
honeyedbiscuit
then
more
lemon
peel
and
cucumber
into
a
drying
finish
carbonation
is
perfect
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
a
pillowy
feel
i
like
cucumber
but
after
the
initial
few
sips
i
wasnt
sure
id
get
through
a
bomber
then
the
sorachi
ace
started
kicking
in
a
great
combo
its
quite
tasty
and
does
a
fantastic
job
featuring
cucumber
bottled
6812
overall
this
beer
was
delicious
the
cucumber
aspect
was
spot
on
i
thought
that
it
was
a
little
different
than
most
saisons
but
in
a
good
way
very
original
worth
seeking
out
for
sure
o
this
was
an
interesting
beer
that
i
definitely
enjoyed
having
the
chance
to
try
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
how
cucumber
fits
with
beer
i
can
definitely
see
why
people
might
not
like
this
that
much
but
i
definitely
think
this
was
a
perfect
summer
beer
for
a
hot
night
drinking
this
in
90
degree
summer
heat
it
was
light
crisp
refreshing
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
if
you
like
interesting
beers
i
definitely
recommend
picking
this
up
and
giving
it
a
try
not
your
typical
saison
but
definitely
enjoyable
beer
is
thin
like
water
and
wet
like
water
and
tastes
like
cucumbers
is
this
beer
next
medium
bodied
with
some
zesty
pepper
and
coriander
spice
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
funky
farmhouse
and
bready
yeast
notes
before
finishing
with
a
refreshing
cucumber
melon
flavor
in
the
finish
the
cucumber
is
more
prominent
than
the
nose
suggests
but
ts
not
over
the
top
or
unpleasant
at
all
really
light
and
refreshing
making
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
was
skeptical
going
in
but
this
beer
was
a
surprise
sleeper
for
me
o
look
it
was
good
and
im
very
glad
i
tried
it
not
sure
ill
be
in
a
hurry
to
crack
open
another
bottle
but
given
the
right
day
the
right
food
pairing
i
think
it
would
be
absolutely
amazing
definitely
not
an
allnight
drinker
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
if
saison
wasnt
in
the
name
of
the
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
have
come
up
with
that
for
the
base
beers
style
overall
this
is
genius
really
enjoyed
the
mix
of
flavors
i
would
have
more
given
the
chance
overall
fairly
impressed
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
has
a
good
essences
of
cucumber
and
pickle
none
of
the
bitter
skin
either
and
a
nice
refreshing
taste
i
could
drink
lots
of
this
too
this
was
really
something
i
felt
like
i
needed
to
try
this
one
at
the
ebf
just
because
of
the
cucumber
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
this
is
straight
cucumber
i
really
dont
get
much
else
on
the
nose
here
the
taste
is
cucumber
also
i
like
that
it
really
stands
out
and
isnt
masked
in
any
way
the
beer
is
surprisingly
refreshing
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
carbonated
with
a
light
finish
overall
this
was
just
something
that
really
sparked
my
interest
and
i
was
very
glad
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
funky
buddha
saisons
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
style
but
i
will
try
everyone
in
hopes
of
finding
a
great
one
this
beer
is
one
of
them
this
beer
is
well
balanced
with
the
right
amount
of
cucumber
in
the
nose
and
taste
it
doesnt
over
power
the
beer
but
enhances
the
flavor
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
fb
had
a
ccb
tap
takeover
with
virgin
oak
hunahpu
on
tap
i
would
have
drank
this
beer
til
the
tap
blew
from
start
to
end
this
is
a
great
saison
poured
a
glowing
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
haze
huge
aromas
of
cucumber
and
saison
yeast
with
a
slight
pickle
brine
character
taste
follows
the
nose
nicely
just
slightly
briny
yet
so
crisp
and
drinkable
just
a
perfect
melding
between
a
cucumber
and
a
saison
if
you
can
imagine
such
a
thin
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
and
good
sharp
carbonation
tied
with
final
push
for
my
favorite
beer
of
the
day
this
was
an
amazing
offering
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
ring
of
head
smells
like
sushi
actually
cucumber
and
that
sweet
cold
rice
aroma
the
taste
is
fairly
similar
to
the
nose
sweet
light
and
refreshing
light
feel
bordering
on
watery
overall
pretty
good
id
have
it
again
as
of
61712
i
have
had
the
newer
batch
on
draft
and
in
bottle
fresh
this
version
was
very
refreshing
light
and
much
more
cucumber
in
flavor
without
any
accompanying
brine
may
re
review
when
i
open
a
bottle
because
it
was
substantially
more
enjoyable
for
my
palate
a
nice
representation
of
a
flanders
red
with
out
being
to
much
of
a
flanders
red
fantastic
saison
with
a
fluffy
head
that
collects
like
softserve
vanilla
ice
cream
great
flavor
and
medium
carbonation
o
decent
farmhouse
ale
its
a
catchall
category
despite
the
lack
of
funk
or
tartness
its
still
a
decent
beer
still
not
worth
what
it
costs
per
the
usual
lost
abbey
pricing
range
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
strong
black
pepper
tongue
it
starts
with
some
creaminess
but
end
bitterly
in
the
swallow
predictable
body
with
an
elevated
level
of
carbonation
overall
an
impressively
drinkable
saison
o
overall
this
beer
is
very
very
good
do
not
usually
like
this
style
but
everything
is
well
balanced
no
coriander
taste
to
the
yeast
o
this
beer
is
excellent
the
only
problem
i
had
with
it
was
the
sweetness
i
believe
saisons
should
be
drier
thats
all
will
definitely
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
and
perhaps
get
this
one
again
might
buy
this
again
i
believe
this
would
be
good
with
food
wishing
i
had
a
nice
think
pork
chop
right
now
o
awesome
saison
available
year
round
from
la
tbh
i
skip
this
over
for
other
lost
abbey
beers
i
think
that
will
have
to
change
as
this
is
awesome
saison
and
cheap
compared
to
other
la
stuff
m
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
drying
finish
with
a
lasting
pepper
linger
a
fairly
blusterous
and
straightup
solid
saison
while
heaviness
isnt
normally
an
attribute
of
the
style
the
weight
here
more
or
less
works
soaking
up
some
of
the
more
wayward
spice
and
yeast
and
somewhat
justifying
the
heat
from
the
notthathigh
abv
another
worthy
enough
offering
from
this
brewing
project
tastes
peppery
with
yeasty
bready
characteristics
and
a
bit
of
a
funky
wet
hay
character
its
estery
and
floral
with
a
pleasing
bite
enjoyable
o
not
a
good
mix
of
flavors
o
not
my
favorite
farmhouse
but
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
a
summer
beer
decent
beer
not
sure
if
its
my
favorite
style
though
o
i
had
previously
given
this
one
a
4
but
i
dont
think
thats
the
case
now
it
could
be
because
this
one
is
fresh
and
the
other
had
some
more
time
on
it
to
bring
out
some
funkiness
im
not
sure
but
this
wasnt
particularly
interesting
overall
awesome
saison
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
get
someone
who
has
never
had
a
saison
its
not
overly
spiced
or
overly
fruity
and
very
refreshing
great
beer
that
will
stay
in
my
rotation
all
summer
long
o
my
first
ever
lost
abbey
and
it
was
a
nice
saison
wi
does
not
have
many
saisions
so
it
is
always
nice
when
bas
can
bring
me

a

offering
o
this

is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
its

the
dryness

carbonation
in
the

has

taste
that
you
want
to
keep
taking
another
sip
doesnt
really
leave
a
lingering
aftertaste
except
for
some
sour
fruit
but
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
great
for
sitting
in
the
sun
and
drinking
overall
this
is
a
solid

very

last
all
the

poured
into

a
beautiful

begs
for

i
like
it

from
750ml
corked

caged

into
stemless

glass
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a

foamy

great
belgian
crisp
fruity
and
straw
aromas
flavor
of
slightly
fruity
like
cantalope
or
grape
mixed
with
the
typical
belgian
yeasty
earthy
spicy
saison
flavor
with
a
slight
pepper
finish
perfectly
dry
and
tart
for
a
saison
really
nice
brew
but
my
only
complaint
is
the
price
its
deff
well
crafted
but
i
think
it
was
around
15
i
bought
in
philly
where
i
hear
you
have
to
pony
up
a
big
city
beer
tax
but
im
not
sure
id
get
again
at
that
price
overall
i
really
liked
this
saison
such
a
big
nice
presentation
makes
for
an
ideal
bottle
to
share
our
have
with
an
elegant
dinner
instead
of
wine
i
will
try
to
pick
this
up
again
the
red
barn
ale
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
red
and
loved
the
combination
of
fruitiness
to
bold
ale
flavors
i
had
this
on
tap
at
yardhouse
and
would
recommend
it
contains
a
very
rich
finish
too
that
was
nice
and
refreshing
a
real
fine
saison
much
different
than
expected
with
very
little
spice
or
fruit
to
it
just
a
whole
lot
of
barnyard
funk
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
ever
more
crowded
world
of
american
made
saisons
murky
pale
copper
in
color
maybe
a
little
lighter
than
that
with
four
inches
or
so
of
bone
white
head
with
outstanding
retention
the
nose
is
all
yeast
grassy
and
dry
mouth
watering
there
is
maybe
just
a
touch
of
lemony
citrus
to
the
flavor
but
again
its
all
yeast
for
me
straw
and
pollen
and
wet
grass
its
very
summery
august
beer
delicate
and
robust
at
the
same
time
no
gimmicks
excellent
carbonation
and
a
lighter
than
medium
body
its
down
easy
and
crackling
dry
in
the
finish
had
it
side
by
side
with
the
dupont
saison
and
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
liked
this
better
it
has
a
great
yeast
strain
unlike
any
other
i
can
recall
and
the
beer
just
comes
together
really
well
yet
another
fine
lost
abbey
product
who
after
a
couple
of
soso
beers
is
starting
to
win
me
back
over
with
stuff
like
this
o
good
all
round
saison
happier
than
expected
but
balance
was
still
good
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
my
first
lost
abbey
beer
its
light
crisp
with
no
offensive
flavors
or
bittering
yeasts
worth
seeking
the
other
beers
out
for
10
dollars
most
likely
never
not
a
bad
saison
but
not
my
favorite
its
earthy
and
mildly
bitter
and
at
times
i
feel
like
im
licking
a
flower
looks
gorgeous
though
lighter
medium
body
well
carbonated
extremely
drinkable
and
clean
on
the
tongue
ive
had
this
before
and
somehow
never
reviewed
it
theres
certainly
more
expressive
and
innovative
saisons
out
there
but
this
is
a
refreshing
example
of
a
clean
quaffable
brew
o
its
ok
spicy
and
tasty
weird
smell
though
o
while
there
are
a
lot
of
different
spice
flavors
in
this
beer
they
really
come
together
well
and
match
well
with
none
of
them
dominating
the
others
enjoyable
but
not
super
easy
to
drink
because
of
how
dry
it
is
deceptively
easy
to
drink
by
its
flavor
characteristics
one
of
the
cleaner
tasting
american
saisons
i
have
had
the
body
was
good
crisp
dry
and
medium
drinkability
was
very
good
this
was
the
rare
instance
that
i
didnt
mind
the
usually
hated
large
format
bottle
overall
a
pretty
nice
example
of
the
style
certainly
worth
grabbing
if
you
see
it
wow
excellent
beer
poured
at
a
good
good
temperature
with
a
mammoth
super
frothy
foamy
billowy
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
clingy
lace
color
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
straw
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
upon
first
pouring
had
a
fleeting
perfumey
fruity
honey
mustiness
that
quickly
was
replaced
by
malt
yeast
herbs
flavors
somewhat
like
nose
has
a
great
bittercarbonic
tang
balance
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
make
this
incredibly
tasty
and
drinkable
yet
satisfying
body
and
carbonation
are
perfect
great
burps
too
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
and
a
bit
boozy
one
of
the
best
saisons
ever
including
any
belgian
overall
a
solid
saison
worth
trying
i
would
have
again
easily
o
decent
farmhouse
i
tend
to
like
less
dry
finish
on
my
saisons
pours
a
slightly
hazed
gold
modest
cap
of
white
froth

the

bready
peppery
zesty

still
good
medium

slightly
less
bubbly
than
others
dry
finish
solid
flavored
saison
but
lacking
in
authenticity
another
new
take
on
the
versatile
saision
style
this
one
has
a
good
backbone
and
demands
slower
sipping
but
rewards
with
some
depth
and
spicing
that
suits
the
yeast
rather
than
clashing
with
it
light
citrus
and
moderate
hopping
set
it
apart
but
it
still
feels
authentic

overall
well
done
overall
for
the
style
well
spiced
so
that
you
can
not
pick
out
any
given
spice
but
that
they
all
combine
to
make
a
nice
bouquet
for
both
the
aroma
and
taste
very
nice
treat
this
bottle
pours
a
nice
clear
applejuice
like
color
with
a
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
up
to
a
thick
two
finger
head
that
eventually
retains
to
one
finger
stays
a
thick
finger
til
its
drank
to
the
bottom
the
smell
alone
is
refreshing
tingly
orange
peel
forefront
with
yeast
and
spice
bitterness
a
very
earthy
aroma
that
is
very
relaxing
to
enjoy
taste
has
more
of
the
yeast
and
spices
used
but
very
balanced
out
with
slight
citrus
sweetness
of
the
orange
peel
feels
great
to
drink
nicely
carbonated
and
light
in
the
mouth
while
the
head
foam
finds
its
spot
on
the
roof
the
only
other
saison
ive
ever
had
is
saison
du
buff
the
stone
collaboration
i
really
like
that
one
but
if
i
had
to
choose
one
to
drink
regularly
it
would
definitely
be
red
barn
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
of
a
hazy
wheat
yellow
with
a
lot
of
foam
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
the
smell
of
carbonated
citrus
was
very
evident
not
impressive
the
taste
was
a
load
of
carbonated
citrus
acid
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
not
much
of
anything
else
way
to
acidic
on
the
tongue
palate
and
stomach
big
aftertaste
of
bitter
acidic
flavor
not
a
typical
lost
abbey
ale
in
my
mind
this
is
a
good
brew
it
is
very
yeasty
but
seems
to
have
more
of
that
raw
flavor
overall
complex
and
intriguing
brew
with
rustic
charm
sourness
and
brings
a
great
american
character
to
a
traditionally
foreign
brew
this
beer
from
a
750
ml
bottle
is
a
cloudy
hazy
brownishgold
color
the
head
is
thick
ans
staying
its
a
wild
and
funky
beer
yeasty
fruit
some
sugar
and
spice
the
taste
is
more
balanced
than
expected
the
taste
is
light
but
earthy
and
damp
it
doesnt
get
to
sou
but
is
certainly
wild
the
beer
holds
up
well
and
is
definitely
unique
but
its
also
an
acquired
taste
for
those
that
have
already
acquired
quite
a
lot
unique
and
well
brewed
but
well
just
a
bit
off
i
guess
sweet
sour
rich
and
bitter
try
wrapping
your
head
around
this
beer
o
i
was
surprised
at
how
many
layers
of
flavor
there
are
in
this
beer
this
is
a
very
very
good
saison
definitely
worth
the
purchase
overall
a
nice
saison
a
little
heavy
on
the
ginger
for
me
but
still
enjoyable
looks
exactly
like
duponts
saison
simplier
but
tastier
and
more
drinkable
than
duponts
nicely
dry
spicy
phenolic
touch
of
clove
hoppy
bitter
bitter
orange
or
seeds
of
paradise
perhaps
but
not
brett
less
pilsner
flavor
than
duponts
too
not
a
bad
thing
o
a
solid
saison
but
i
prefer
lost
abbeys
carnevale
to
this
one
d
a
solid
saison
that
drinks
a
bit
sweet
would
like
it
a
little
drier
tasting
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
citrus
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
of
grain
spices
and
yeast
there
is
a
mild
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
b
o
not
my
favorite
saison
but
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
had
this
is
my
first
lost
abbey
and
unfortunately
its
not
a
good
start
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
overall
a
very
enjoyable
saison
loads
of
spiciness
and
funkiness
to
keep
interesting
throughout
nice
beer
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
on
super
bowl
sunday
as
a
pregame
snack
served
from
bottle
into
a
bells
stemmed
tulip
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
four
finger
pure
white
head
that
continued
to
grow
throughout
the
glass
yes
thats
right
grow
it
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
spices
fruit
and
earth
hop
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
fruit
earth
hop
spices
and
subtle
banana
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
the
look
of
this
brew
was
what
i
would
want
all
of
my
saisons
to
look
not
much
can
be
improved
on
that
the
flavor
however
left
me
a
little
to
want
though
the
aftertaste
just
hit
you
in
the
face
with
dirt
if
i
am
completely
honest
it
wasnt
bad
but
definitely
not
ideal
still
a
great
beer
to
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
before
overall
this
is
a
very
wellcrafted
and
tasty
saison
it
is
eminently
quaffable
and
great
on
a
sunny
day
like
this
overall
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
lost
abbey
but
still
delicious
and
very
drinkable
it
might
be
just
a
touch
too
much
on
the
dryfloral
side
happy
i
tried
but
id
grab
something
else
next
time

i
really
liked
this
beer
good
job
strong
head
on
it
the
lace
gripped
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
big
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
lemon
citrus
lemon
grass
spice
and
yeast
in
the
taste
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
dry
lemon
grass
earth
and
a
small
tartness
a
spice
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
lightly
dry
lemon
citrus
and
spice
in
the
aftertaste
spicy
refreshing
small
tartness
and
it
is
very
nice
excellent
ale
but
a
surprise
given
the
name
red
barn
is
just
not
doing
it
for
me
i
like
a
dry
earthy
flavor
in
a
saison
this
takes
these
flavors
a
bit
too
far
the
flavor
becomes
a
bit
overpowering
and
brings
the
drinkability
on
a
bit
an
enjoyable
farmhouse
ale
from
the
lost
abbey
pours
a
semihazed
dark
apricot
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
and
a
good
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
stone
fruit
plus
some
light
spice
hints
of
grain
flavor
has
a
good
dosing
of
fruit
and
light
spice
lightmedium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
nice
beer
beautiful
golden
pour
with
a
thick
white
head
there
is
a
nice
wheat
smell
with
a
little
herb
touch
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
with
another
saison
to
see
some
difference
so
if
anyone
has
any
suggestions
on
a
great
saison
please
drop
me
a
message
and
let
me
know
also
kudos
to
lost
abbey
on
the
bottling
and
presentation
of
there
beers
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
buy
beer
based
on
the
labeling
and
bottles
and
this
will
definatly
attract
them
i
cant
wait
to
try
other
lost
abbey
brews
i
must
admit
my
palate
may
be
out
of
touch
with
the
saison
style
however
this
really
seems
to
have
at
least
a
hint
of
just
about
every
trait
one
can
ask
for
o
becomes
more
assertive
as
it
warms
has
a
profile
that
is
reminiscent
of
orval
minus
the
brett
certainly
not
for
all
palates
its
an
intellectual
beer
that
raises
many
talking
points
good
with
a
red
curry
and
to
be
shared
a
good
beer
but
i
really
did
want
it
to
be
better
a
touch
of
acidity
on
the
palate
would
have
helped
as
probably
would
have
a
lighter
touch
on
the
spices
assuming
they
added
someif
not
its
a
good
job
they
did
getting
the
yeast
to
produce
such
flavours
but
its
still
pretty
drinkable
and
pretty
enjoyable
unfortunately
my
standards
for
saisons
and
for
the
lost
abbey
are
unreasonably
high
so
i
did
find
this
something
of
a
disappointment
not
a
bad
beer
overall
reminded
me
of
a
hoegaarden
white
id
try
it
again
so
many
saisons
blend
together
to
me
some
tend
towards
a
ripe
barley
flavor
some
a
more
citrusy
flavor
but
this
one
really
played
up
the
spices
the
way
a
west
coast
ipa
plays
up
the
hops
i
thought
at
first
my
taste
buds
wouldnt
last
a
whole
pint
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
noticed
more
complexities
this
is
one
of
two
saisons
that
went
the
super
spicy
route
the
other
being
orchard
white
by
the
bruery
and
that
had
too
much
lavender
for
my
liking
although
this
has
too
much
spice
for
me
to
order
frequently
its
a
refreshing
interesting
beer
id
try
again
another
night
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
saison
i
do
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
and
to
sample
a
couple
beers
from
this
brewery
o
first
brew
from
the
lost
abbey
though
i
always
see
it
at
shops
around
the
chicago
area
refreshing
and
a
solid
saison
for
a
humid
summer
day
o
love
the
pour
and
the
smell
of
this
one
a
solid
saison
only
bought
it
because
it
was
on
sale
the
first
carbonated
lost
abbey
bottle
i
have
tried
medium
gold
body
some
visible
carbonation
but
not
a
lot
34
finger
white
head
quick
dissipation
with
some
lacing
present
nose
is
fairly
spicy
coriander
dominant
with
some
meyer
lemon
esters
floral
hops
taste
is
once
again
fairly
spicy
for
the
style
balanced
by
floral
notes
and
light
lemony
goodness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
good
effervescence
real
drinkable
fit
well
into
the
progression
for
the
tasting
and
the
socal
theme
pours
a
gold
hazy
color
with
a
thick
cloud
like
fluffy
3
finger
head
that
dissipates
to
a
constant
one
finger
head
aroma
of
funk
yeast
citrus
and
pepper
taste
follows
the
nose
with
overwhelming
fruity
notes
very
fresh
and
refreshing
aside
from
what
fantome
offers
this
may
be
my
favorite
saison
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
that
wasnt
what
i
anticipated
but
certainly
was
an
enjoyable
experience
t
taste
is
pretty
solid
with
a
malty
backbone
and
a
lot
of
earthiness
towards
the
finish
some
spicy
almost
medicinal
hops
towards
the
finish
as
well
as
some
belgian
yeast
red
barn
comes
through
a
burnt
red
color
but
is
more
like
a
rusted
copper
shade
with
a
tanbeige
inch
of
foam
up
above
not
to
thick
nor
thin
on
par
per
style
nice
staggering
pieces
of
foam
on
the
glass
smell
is
grassy
like
with
a
hint
of
apple
and
some
type
of
belgian
yeast
imparting
a
light
bisquit
vibe
small
hits
of
citrus
is
very
hard
to
sense
but
it
is
there
sweet
malt
brown
and
the
like
pretty
bold
in
scent
off
the
tap
at
least
taste
is
a
saison
with
a
hint
of
beire
de
garde
flavor
kinda
a
mix
of
the
two
grassy
floral
apple
over
pear
slight
bisquit
from
the
malt
leaving
for
a
well
balanced
saison
yet
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
as
a
saison
this
hits
the
marks
though
except
the
yeast
is
a
bit
lighter
than
belgian
types
making
this
more
in
line
with
american
styles
feel
is
a
step
above
well
lets
say
its
approaching
medium
carbed
up
nice
off
the
tap
with
a
crisp
finish
and
slightly
dry
glad
i
tried
this
doubt
i
would
buy
a
bottle
of
it
but
if
i
can
get
it
on
the
cheap
off
the
tap
in
a
pint
ill
always
be
game
mouthfeel
nice
body
and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drank
this
bomber
pretty
damn
quick
this
beer
pours
a
clean
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
thick
foamy
white
head
that
retains
very
well
and
laces
as
you
drink
the
aroma
has
the
typical
saison
characteristics
of
some
earthy
hops
banana
and
citrus
notes
the
aroma
was
also
pretty
slinky
which
is
why
it
good
not
as
good
ratings
from
me
the
taste
starts
with
sweet
banana
and
citrus
and
then
a
little
maltiness
and
maybe
a
hint
of
salt
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
overcarbonated
and
finishes
with
a
very
bitter
feel
overall
an
ok
saison
taste
is
good
fruity
light
and
crisp
maybe
a
little
thin
but
for
a
summertime
beer
thats
not
necessarily
bad
a
bitter
bite
in
there
too
a
good
but
maybe
not
great
example
of
a
saison
for
the
price
better
ones
can
be
found
o
the
dominate
flavors
although
still
soft
were
apple
juice
and
stale
spices
makes
this
a
bland
beer
there
was
a
good
dry
finish
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
to
full
to
make
this
crisp
and
refreshing
i
love
this
style
and
didnt
get
any
yeast
character
that
i
like
in
a
saision
o
sort
of
a
let
down
compared
to
how
i
recall
this
beer
being
might
have
to
revisit
it
again
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
interesting
and
worth
trying
out
o
a
delicious
saison
on
the
herbal
side
of
the
style
if
the
base
yeast
profile
wasnt
overcome
by
the
sour
throat
lozenge
character
id
love
this
beer
i
just
found
the
spicingadditions
to
be
overdone
o
very
solid
saison
and
what
you
would
imagine
a
saison
to
be
very
good
drink
nothing
over
the
top
thanks
adam
for
sending
this
my
way
o
a
really
nice
saison
overall
nice
to
drink
at
the
pool
as
it
is
refreshing
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
no
doubt
overall
this
is
a
decent
little
american
saison
but
there
are
others
i
think
are
better
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
as
it
is
enjoyable
medium
body
decent
carbonation
easy
to
drink
temp
needed
to
come
up
on
this
one
quenching
and
rich
in
flavor
a
good
brew
mouth
overall
while
the
savory
spicing
would
make
it
an
easy
choice
to
pair
with
a
variety
of
grub
just
one
its
own
i
find
the
spice
addition
to
be
slowly
incessantly
rankling
very
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
gave
it
a
nice
finish
just
didnt
seem
like
a
saison
but
not
a
bad
beer
o
this
is
a
tasty
farmhouse
ale
thats
well
worth
it
for
the
price
will
definitely
give
this
one
another
try
fruit
and
spice
and
yeast
in
holy
matrimony
excellent
flavors
great
spice
profile
very
tart
and
dry
very
complex
saison
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
highly
recommended
taste
starts
with
light
toasted
pilsner
malt
imbuing
soft
biscuits
and
crackers
the
middle
has
an
herbal
spice
and
hop
flavor
that
refreshes
the
palate
along
with
the
awesome
bubbly
mouthfeel
the
finish
and
linger
are
a
mild
earthy
bitterness
from
both
spice
and
hop
with
just
a
faint
nuance
of
bread
crust
on
the
finish
i
liked
this
saison
a
lot
great
aroma
but
wish
there
was
just
a
little
more
going
on
in
the
taste
still
great
offering
from
lost
abbey
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
tasted
at
the
pearl
in
point
loma
san
diego
o
this
is
deffinitely
a
good
saison
the
mouthfeel
is
the
highlight
would
certainly
have
this
again
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
nicely
done
saison
pretty
classic
with
great
balance
i
like
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
not
as
dry
but
most
in
this
style
are
like
this
this
is
a
very
solid
saison
overall
i
liked
it
and
wife
liked
it
too
bottle
opened
with
a
nice
pop
o
the
maltiness
is
over
done
from
what
i
like
lemony
peppery
and
funky
goodness
love
the
label
of
this
brew
and
it
pours
a
deep
golden
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
heaps
of
lacingthe
smell
is
barnyard
funkyeasty
bread
and
spicy
herbal
hopsit
has
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
which
coats
the
mouth
with
tastes
of
tart
barnyard
funkspicesorange
rind
and
finished
with
a
spicy
hop
bitterness
that
is
somewhat
tart
aswell
and
overall
its
not
o
seems
wellmade
but
just
not
so
much
my
style
of
farmhouse
ale
id
like
a
little
less
dry
a
little
more
fruity
esters
o
great
belgian
saison
style
big
fan
of
port
brewing
and
lost
abbey
already
and
this
just
adds
to
that
list
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
belgian
ales
and
fine
ale
in
general
pours
a
lovely
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
very
thick
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
strong
fruity
yeasty
and
malty
with
hoppy
and
sour
hints
fruity
flavor
has
malty
and
yeasty
tones
as
well
as
some
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
sour
undertone
texture
is
quite
fizzy
and
leaves
a
tingle
that
has
a
tone
of
grapefruit
somewhat
like
an
ipa
this
beer
is
for
sipping
and
savoring
not
for
swilling
also
it
is
best
appreciated
by
itself
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
im
definitely
very
picky
while
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
id
definitely
drink
this
one
again
given
the
chance
i
had
to
pick
this
one
up
recently
while
in
chicago
anything
from
the
lost
abbey
at
8
99
is
worth
trying
it
pours
a
murky
beautiful
golden
yellow
with
a
three
finger
foamy
poofy
bright
white
head
id
say
its
a
golden
honey
in
color
the
foam
takes
a
little
while
to
calm
down
it
has
multifaceted
aromas
depending
on
the
whiff
you
take
youll
get
some
yeast
bread
light
pale
malt
sweetness
spice
citrus
or
even
a
touch
of
sour
the
flavor
is
very
dry
spicy
with
a
light
citrus
finish
on
the
verge
of
being
bitter
its
tasty
and
different
its
a
little
light
on
the
palate
and
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
citrus
like
after
taste
behind
its
solid
and
worth
a
try
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
no
doubt
it
is
a
little
bit
funky
but
i
like
my
saisons
a
little
wilder
personally
this
is
personal
preference
on
the
other
hand
the
total
hop
profile
is
very
dominant
on
this
beer
so
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
in
a
couple
years
so
they
can
soften
up
some
it
is
coming
across
like
an
imperial
ipa
with
belgian
ingredients
but
i
still
think
that
it
is
close
to
the
style
and
i
am
definitely
glad
that
i
have
finally
tried
one
of
the
lost
abbeys
beers
d
really
tasty
saison
enjoyed
this
with
some
crab
cakes
and
it
was
a
nice
match
jd
this
beer
is
too
easy
to
drink
it
seems
like
it
almost
doesnt
want
you
to
keep
it
around
long
enough
to
appreciate
it
for
all
that
it
is
im
happy
i
had
to
write
this
review
or
i
would
have
downed
it
a
lot
faster
drinkability
a
pretty
good
saison
and
another
fine
offering
from
lost
abbey
not
overpowering
in
any
category
and
one
ill
revisit
during
the
summer
months
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
to
be
sure
great
tastes
unique
flavors
once
the
skunk
fades
fairly
lively
body
and
an
abv
that
wont
wreck
anybodys
palate
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
in
the
hot
summer
months
as
it
comes
across
as
very
refereshing
the
drink
ability
is
awesome
especially
since
they
didnt
go
over
the
top
with
the
alcohol
the
drinkability
is
good
the
750ml
bottle
almost
disappeared
in
no
time
it
went
well
with
vermont
extra
sharp
cheddar
cheese
and
extra
fancy
giardiniera
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
almost
any
food
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
but
i
also
drank
the
bottle
over
a
2
hour
time
period
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
you
like
belgian
beer
this
is
probably
the
best
farmhouse
ale
that
i
have
tried
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
cant
say
i
would
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
750ml
is
not
a
challenge
by
any
means
im
just
now
getting
into
saisons
well
see
how
i
feel
in
a
couple
months
about
this
one
not
my
favorite
saison
or
lost
abbey
beer
but
still
decent
d
good
saison
not
overpowering
in
any
way
and
really
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
suitable
for
great
summer
fun
d
not
to
into
saisons
but
this
one
was
not
to
bad
overall
id
been
passing
over
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
when
in
markets
to
which
la
distributes
in
favor
of
more
limited
releases
and
now
i
see
that
wasnt
a
good
idea
a
very
good
example
for
the
style
and
one
thats
well
worth
a
shot
couldnt
get
a
ton
on
the
aroma
at
first
which
surprised
me
but
eventually
smelled
wheat
grassy
hops
and
yeasty
bread
immediately
after
swirling
and
agitating
tastes
of
grassystraw
notes
a
little
lemon
and
other
spices
a
bit
of
pepper
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
first
but
finishes
smooth
highly
drinkable
dthis
is
a
pretty
tasty
saison
one
of
the
better
lost
abbey
beers
ive
had
very
drinkable
stuff
and
stays
towards
the
belgian
inspiration
the
style
originates
from
md
light
effervescent
mouth
feel
with
a
dry
finish
maybe
a
little
too
much
lingering
bitterness
but
otherwise
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
ever
had
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
well
crafted
i
really
like
the
lable
picture
too
poured
ontap
at
the
portlost
abbey
brewery
the
beer
is
a
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
a
filmy
miniscule
head
there
is
a
sweet
and
peppery
nose
on
this
beer
with
citrus
undertones
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
round
with
heavy
pepper
undertones
to
balance
the
sweet
ginger
and
citrus
flavors
the
beer
has
a
crisp
finish
with
the
slightest
little
kiss
of
hops
there
is
a
nice
smooth
finish
despite
the
peppery
tones
the
boldness
of
the
flavors
makes
this
a
low
quantity
beer
per
sitting
but
unique
nonetheless
t
i
didnt
care
for
the
taste
of
this
one
so
much
its
pretty
bitter
with
a
citrus
rind
and
slightly
medicinal
cocktail
light
funk
and
plenty
of
spices
never
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
very
nice
indeed
overally
this
beer
was
pretty
hard
to
drink
for
a
saison
it
went
down
smooth
but
was
just
a
little
strange
for
me
compared
to
dupont
and
the
classics
and
even
other
lost
abbey
saisons
d
a
nice
saison
with
a
lot
of
those
classic
farmhouse
ale
characteristics
lots
of
spice
yeast
and
pepper
would
like
to
have
again
drinkability
typical
for
the
better
beers
of
this
style
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
towards
the
end
i
notice
something
slightly
off
about
the
hops
but
otherwise
i
have
only
good
things
to
say
d
easy
i
finished
the
750
by
myself
drinkability
s
fairly
drinkable
saison
but
i
cant
say
that
im
dying
to
have
another
one
right
now
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
lost
abbey
but
not
a
complete
success
to
me
red
barn
ranges
in
color
from
burnt
goldenrod
ambient
lighting
to
bright
lemon
yellow
fully
backlit
and
has
some
but
not
total
clarity
the
first
pour
yielded
about
three
fingers
of
head
with
soso
retention
and
no
detectable
lacing
the
second
pour
though
yielded
a
full
extra
fingers
worth
of
pure
white
foam
and
retention
and
lacing
are
markedly
improved
ill
chalk
the
first
pour
up
to
maybe
a
slightly
dirty
glass
and
take
most
of
my
impressions
from
the
second
pour
orange
and
citrus
dominate
the
nose
though
the
grains
of
paradise
and
black
pepper
are
certainly
present
i
cant
really
find
any
ginger
though
and
ditto
that
for
any
malty
flavors
theres
just
the
briefest
flash
of
green
apple
sweetness
and
a
mere
suggestion
of
bitterness
from
restrained
hopping
otherwise
this
beer
is
a
blank
canvas
for
the
yeast
and
spices
to
work
their
magic
again
the
orange
is
the
standout
flavor
with
solid
support
from
black
pepper
and
grains
of
paradise
im
used
to
my
saisons
being
fairly
spicy
so
red
barn
featuring
citrus
more
than
black
pepperclove
is
a
welcome
change
im
a
little
disappointed
that
i
still
cant
find
any
ginger
though
a
top
of
the
line
saison
has
a
truly
transcendent
mouthfeel
and
in
this
regard
red
barn
falls
a
bit
short
even
for
whats
supposed
to
be
a
dry
beer
its
a
bit
too
thin
crossing
the
line
into
watery
at
the
same
time
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
enthusiastic
thin
and
fizzy
is
not
a
good
bodycarbonation
combo
that
dings
the
drinkability
but
just
a
little
bit
red
barn
is
a
fine
beer
with
the
prominent
orange
peel
being
an
interesting
twist
for
the
style
still
i
view
this
as
an
occasional
change
of
pace
beer
from
some
other
saisons
id
probably
opt
for
more
regularly
it
tastes
much
like
it
smells
really
unibroueish
and
tasty
light
tropical
fruit
flavors
and
maybe
a
little
peppery
spice
very
nice
with
a
lasting
peppery
aftertaste
light
bodied
lots
of
flavor
for
the
low
abv
extremely
good
overally
a
very
tasty
saison
ill
definietly
have
another
please
good
job
d
this
farmhouse
ale
is
very
drinkable
great
for
warm
weather
will
definitely
pick
up
again
the
zenlike
focus
and
quality
of
this
beer
leaves
me
with
nothing
more
to
desire
well
done
drinkability
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
probably
drink
it
again
overall
an
interesting
saison
worth
a
try
overall
a
pretty
solid
saison
but
nothing
real
special
either
drinkability
was
high
this
beer
goes
down
easy
i
split
a
large
bottle
at
monks
cafe
for
15
heck
of
a
beer
its
brewed
with
the
saison
dupont
yeast
and
i
think
is
shows
in
the
bright
spicy
character
the
brewing
spices
and
yeast
character
blend
together
with
subtle
layers
of
vanilla
orange
peel
peppercorn
herbal
spice
and
smooth
bready
barley
theres
a
herbal
hop
element
around
the
yeast
character
for
great
fresh
farmhouse
ale
check
this
one
out
drinkability
is
excellent
stuff
one
of
the
best
all
around
american
brewed
saisons
that
uses
many
of
the
belgian
characteristics
with
american
zeal
to
make
it
all
work
together
so
well
d
decent
tasting
light
enough
to
drink
allday
but
given
the
hype
disappointing
will
put
one
in
the
cellar
well
see
how
this
opens
up
in
a
year
or
two
this
is
not
as
boozy
or
astringent
as
the
first
sample
i
had
of
this
beer
i
personally
think
that
their
devotion
is
a
better
take
on
a
saison
hoppy
and
bone
dry
im
not
crazy
about
the
spices
used
in
this
one
but
maybe
that
is
just
personal
preference
d
good
beer
and
very
delicious
take
on
a
great
style
very
wellexecuted
hoppy
saison
which
is
what
i
expected
of
lost
abbey
recommended
for
any
fan
of
the
style
but
definitely
recommended
if
you
like
hoppy
saisons
or
any
blonde
belgian
with
a
stronger
than
normal
hop
presence
the
complexity
and
bite
is
slowing
me
down
somewhat
but
that
doesnt
mean
im
not
enjoying
it
in
short
if
you
like
beers
in
the
genre
pick
this
one
up
d
really
love
this
beer
lots
to
this
beer
another
great
one
from
lost
abbey
i
want
another
already
a
saison
thats
dry
enough
to
bear
the
name
pale
malts
are
dressed
up
in
their
sunday
best
by
orange
peel
spices
and
peppery
saison
yeast
aroma
is
belgian
funk
and
pale
malt
lingering
over
a
clear
pale
amber
beer
alcohol
is
strong
but
doesnt
overpower
the
aromas
hops
are
brisk
and
linger
on
your
palette
with
german
spiciness
its
not
clear
if
this
saison
benefits
from
the
spices
or
not
they
are
certainly
not
inappropriate
or
in
the
way
but
you
wonder
why
the
glories
of
pale
malt
spicy
hops
and
spicy
yeast
need
anything
else
overall
a
tasty
beer
smooth
and
pleasant
and
has
some
character
d
a
nice
pleasant
refreshing
summer
beer
not
exactly
sessionable
but
goes
down
easy
lost
abbey
has
yet
to
let
me
down
i
like
this
beer
and
ill
have
it
again
but
it
wont
take
the
place
of
saison
dupont
or
hennepin
its
a
good
saison
but
a
little
bit
of
an
oddball
maybe
i
need
a
few
more
to
understand
it
better
ill
definitely
have
a
few
more
just
to
be
sure
d
high
had
a
4
oz
sampler
and
would
have
been
much
happier
with
a
22
oz
bottle
great
mouthfeel
with
top
notch
balance
in
the
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
but
probably
best
to
split
this
beer
with
someone
once
its
reached
the
right
temperature
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
left
lots
of
blotchy
lacing
on
the
glass
coriander
and
belgian
strike
first
on
the
aromas
that
had
coriander
and
slight
apple
notes
it
also
got
a
little
spice
as
well
belgian
yeast
brett
and
corinader
dominate
the
palate
which
had
apple
spice
and
grainy
accents
the
beer
was
medsium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
sweet
grainy
finish
pretty
good
saison
from
lost
abbey
and
shows
me
their
getting
better
at
the
belgian
style
beers
d
on
a
hot
day
i
can
imagine
sucking
a
few
of
these
back
and
with
a
6
7
abv
you
have
to
watch
yourself
in
those
situations
very
drinkable
and
very
summery
beer
to
enjoy
on
your
porch
poured
this
summertime
treat
into
my
russian
river
snifter
pours
a
very
nice
murky
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
in
the
nose
i
get
some
funk
with
a
strong
scent
of
green
apples
especially
when
it
warms
up
also
pick
up
some
belgian
yeast
scents
taste
definitely
has
some
lovely
spice
to
it
very
tasty
spices
along
with
green
apple
very
light
funk
and
some
grassywheat
flavors
a
little
alcohol
taste
toward
the
end
very
well
balanced
i
also
get
a
bit
of
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
bite
to
it
just
like
a
good
saison
good
drinkability
on
this
one
golden
with
a
white
head
that
has
just
okay
retention
and
leaves
nice
lace
as
the
beer
disappears
nose
has
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
followed
by
a
hint
of
barn
with
a
lemony
and
citrusy
hoppiness
that
s
of
the
seems
like
sweet
citrus
from
its
harmonizing
with
the
malt
and
maybe
sugar
the
hop
comes
out
a
lot
as
it
warms
taste
is
a
very
wellbalanced
version
of
the
nose
and
is
delivered
on
a
nice
lightmedium
soft
body
with
a
sweet
peppery
hop
finish
that
lasts
another
great
beer
from
one
of
our
best
breweries
i
want
more
d
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
could
drink
and
have
drank
a
number
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
getting
to
try
sometime
drinkability
good
beer
for
the
summer
very
tasty
drinkability
a
very
light
and
smooth
saison
this
is
a
sipper
and
i
could
have
a
couple
d
a
bit
powerful
for
a
session
need
but
tasty
in
all
ambient
weather
conditions
this
is
a
really
nice
saison
no
single
element
amazes
but
the
requisite
complex
spiciness
and
soft
refreshing
character
is
definitely
there
overall
not
the
most
exciting
saison
ive
had
but
drinkable
none
the
less
d
very
drinkable
pleasant
not
overbearing
with
muted
flavors
d
its
a
decent
saison
i
almost
wonder
if
its
got
a
little
age
on
it
based
on
the
mild
flavor
and
aroma
for
the
style
still
its
got
fantastic
drinkability
especially
for
a
summer
beer
not
bad
but
not
a
good
saison
imo
this
is
rather
bland
overall
there
are
much
better
versions
of
the
style
d
goes
down
easy
but
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
going
on
this
is
my
first
la
offering
and
wasnt
really
impressed
but
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
i
am
disappointed
by
this
beer
sure
it
is
an
average
saison
more
or
less
because
it
simply
lacks
the
complexity
that
other
farmhouse
ales
have
it
is
plenty
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
taste
a
slightly
sharp
bitterness
and
fresh
lemonorange
citrus
meet
light
coriander
spiciness
very
pleasant
lemon
peel
bitterness
increases
in
the
middle
with
a
slightly
grapefruity
juiciness
the
underlying
grainyness
is
nice
and
there
is
definite
but
low
level
funkiness
going
on
the
finish
is
crisp
a
little
more
grainy
with
some
alcohol
bite
which
was
surprising
some
funk
remains
reviewed
from
notes
from
last
night
this
is
my
first
real
time
having
a
saison
only
other
one
was
a
sample
of
pretty
things
jack
dor
a
while
ago
poured
into
a
tulip
hazy
golden
with
a
decent
rocky
white
head
shrinks
over
time
forming
a
ring
with
pretty
good
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
grassy
wheat
with
a
bit
of
light
fruit
fruit
and
tartness
come
out
moreso
in
the
taste
green
apple
lemon
grass
wheat
a
tiny
bit
of
cherrylike
tartness
some
booze
taste
too
a
very
little
bit
of
funk
and
not
very
sour
at
all
id
give
it
maybe
a
310
on
the
sour
scale
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
considering
the
style
but
kept
it
at
a
4
just
because
of
a
seemingly
high
alcohol
taste
for
a
6
7
id
try
it
again
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
big
rocky
offwhite
head
smells
yeasty
sweet
peppery
and
slightly
tart
on
the
palate
i
get
more
of
the
same
with
some
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
funk
a
refreshing
beer
with
a
good
sweetsour
balance
as
far
as
mouthfeel
well
at
least
its
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
none
the
sips
sufficient
to
review
it
were
enough
for
me
and
now
it
is
going
down
the
drain
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
goblet
appearance
is
an
amazing
golden
blonde
tint
a
thick
white
foam
is
left
behind
after
a
soft
pour
some
lacing
is
left
behind
the
aroma
here
is
amazing
its
a
mixture
of
funky
belgian
yeast
floral
notes
and
soft
fruity
elements
something
in
my
mind
is
screaming
pineapple
and
tropical
fruit
the
taste
is
delicious
as
well
smooth
refreshing
and
certifiably
funky
absolutely
drinkable
could
sip
on
this
one
all
day
especially
during
the
hot
central
valley
summer
weve
got
coming
up
in
northern
california
lost
abbey
has
done
this
belgian
classic
better
than
most
belgians
this
is
at
or
above
the
efforts
of
dupont
and
in
imo
well
above
hennepin
or
any
american
saisons
overall
a
fantastic
effort
on
the
part
of
portlost
abbey
d
a
nice
refreshing
saison
definitely
not
in
the
superfunky
saison
family
more
like
a
hennepin
if
that
floats
your
boat
this
is
certainly
one
to
check
out
d
im
not
that
into
it
though
i
remember
it
tasting
better
the
first
time
i
had
it
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
saison
style
it
is
highly
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
taste
that
keeps
inviting
the
drinker
to
come
back
for
more
i
really
enjoyed
the
red
barn
ale
it
pours
golden
with
white
head
that
lingers
and
sticks
to
the
glass
you
can
smell
the
citrus
flavor
there
is
a
great
deal
of
flavor
seems
like
it
would
be
a
great
summer
season
beer
its
pretty
refreshing
too
there
is
some
nice
carbonation
to
this
beer
as
well
this
was
a
good
saison
i
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
which
is
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
nicely
flavored
and
complex
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
a
few
off
notes
but
certainly
worth
a
try
hv
it
is
not
as
refreshing
and
summery
as
the
marketing
on
the
bottle
hopes
to
portray
note
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
swirled
it
around
a
bit
made
it
a
bit
more
cloudy
but
not
much
and
toned
down
the
bittersour
taste
a
bit
to
make
it
a
tad
more
drinkable
from
a
2
to
2
5
but
it
is
still
problematic
look
and
smell
started
very
promising
but
the
taste
was
disappointing
the
spices
are
understated
and
there
just
is
not
enough
flavor
for
my
personnel
taste
d
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
maybe
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
heavy
with
its
maltiness
for
a
saison
it
has
a
clear
golden
reddish
body
with
a
slightly
foam
white
head
and
very
minimal
carbonation
lots
of
spice
in
the
aroma
i
can
detect
the
ginger
and
some
nice
pepperiness
there
are
also
sweet
grains
in
the
aroma
the
flavours
are
also
spicy
with
lots
of
pepper
and
a
clear
taste
of
yeasts
behind
there
is
a
somewhat
subtle
maltiness
that
has
a
slight
creamy
toffee
taste
the
mouthfeel
has
little
carbonation
although
this
provides
quite
a
smooth
feel
very
nice
saison
with
an
easy
drinkability
i
picked
this
up
because
i
love
saisons
and
it
garnered
an
overall
a
rating
here
but
frankly
im
underwhelmed
and
a
little
disappointed
this
beer
walks
the
line
between
belgian
pale
and
saison
extremely
tasty
75cl
bottle
clear
deep
goldorange
color
with
a
big
wispy
and
lacy
head
head
sustains
almost
to
the
bottom
potent
and
sweet
aroma
with
nectar
orange
marmalade
leather
and
black
pepper
flavor
is
spicy
with
ground
pepper
and
zesty
earthy
hops
starts
with
a
little
citric
sweetness
and
finishes
quite
dry
with
alcohol
stripping
the
tongue
along
with
a
light
citric
astringency
spicy
pepper
lingers
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
mediumlight
body
with
smooth
but
tenacious
carbonation
the
dryness
and
spice
makes
it
quite
refreshing
but
there
is
a
tad
too
much
pepper
in
the
finish
still
quite
good
but
it
would
be
one
of
my
top
beers
if
they
toned
this
down
a
little
da
full
flavoured
sharp
saison
that
delivers
a
full
frontal
assault
of
spiciness
and
mustiness
with
a
nice
underlying
honeyesque
sweetness
this
one
is
hard
not
to
like
for
a
saison
lover
like
myself
md
a
wonderful
saison
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
had
medium
bodied
with
well
blended
and
balanced
flavors
and
aromas
a
taste
that
begs
you
to
try
another
to
see
if
you
got
all
the
flavors
drinkability
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
some
more
depth
and
funkiness
would
have
been
really
nice
a
good
beer
but
i
ended
up
giving
away
the
last
half
of
it
in
favor
of
something
else
crisp
medium
body
with
a
spicy
peppery
zest
up
front
as
well
as
some
full
bready
yeast
character
crisp
light
fruit
notes
and
a
very
prominent
citrus
presence
mostly
orange
and
grapefruit
also
there
is
some
subtle
lemon
peel
as
well
as
some
strawberry
peaches
and
cream
slightly
earthy
with
a
bit
of
tart
bretty
funk
their
is
a
large
emphasis
on
the
grapefruit
tartness
and
earthy
funk
the
more
i
drink
the
more
it
tastes
like
a
beer
version
of
grapefruit
juice
which
is
very
unpleasant
slight
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
but
overall
the
alcohol
is
decently
masked
dry
tart
grapefruit
finish
i
drank
a
couple
of
these
loved
them
drink
this
all
day
i
found
this
to
be
one
of
the
easier
drinking
saisons
i
have
had
the
alcohol
was
barely
noticeable
i
could
easily
polish
off
multiple
750s
of
this
guy
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
if
i
could
get
over
the
taste
d
delicious
not
very
horsey
but
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
very
very
enjoyable
but
different
farmhousesaison
with
the
nice
hop
bite
i
really
loved
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
anytime
easily
one
of
my
favorite
in
the
style
nice
work
tomme
this
one
is
a
win
drinkability
not
bad
despite
the
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
dryer
and
hoppier
saisons
ive
had
a
very
drinkable
saison
from
the
lost
abby
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
drink
is
very
good
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
a
light
bodied
and
very
tasty
d
since
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
finishes
dry
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
no
noticeable
alcohol
bite
the
bitterness
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
but
not
enough
to
hinder
consumption
taste
should
be
3
8
and
drinkability
a
4
0
very
thick
feel
to
it
starts
with
very
soft
lemon
progresses
to
a
tart
orange
and
sour
peach
flavors
not
too
impressed
here
some
sort
of
weird
malt
taste
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
well
that
was
a
pleasant
brew
but
wheres
the
love
for
the
red
barn
one
of
the
more
affordable
lost
abbey
brew
on
the
market
and
a
very
good
one
too
d
i
really
really
like
this
brew
more
funk
than
a
lot
of
saisons
and
it
works
exceptionally
well
with
the
fruity
spicy
flavor
profile
id
love
to
drink
this
with
fried
fish
tacos
a
chicagostyle
hotdog
or
a
bright
cows
milk
cheese
like
piermont
from
robie
farm
in
piermont
nh
fans
of
saisons
seek
out
this
brew
difficult
to
put
down
glad
i
picked
this
up
after
being
disappointed
in
serpents
stout
overall
very
smooth
and
creamy
just
a
touch
over
carbonated
the
head
wont
go
away
and
it
keeps
me
from
wanting
todrink
this
balanced
farmhouse
as
quickly
as
i
want
to
d
a
bit
better
than
avg
drinkability
not
overwhelming
but
intense
at
times
not
ommegang
but
welldone
one
of
my
top
beers
from
the
abbey
drinkability
heavy
in
some
ways
but
definitely
a
saison
style
with
the
clove
and
bread
style
if
thats
your
thing
its
really
drinkable
but
for
me
it
bogged
down
after
a
while
from
the
sheer
weightiness
overall
a
solid
beer
that
displays
the
saison
style
pretty
proficiently
d
nice
spiced
up
saison
with
a
good
amount
of
funk
to
mix
things
up
and
keep
it
interesting
this
is
definitely
not
too
sweet
at
all
for
the
style
which
in
turn
really
enhances
its
overall
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
and
this
style
is
growing
on
me
i
want
to
have
this
brew
with
a
nice
ham
dinner
d
overall
great
this
represents
what
a
saison
should
be
with
even
though
some
brettanomyeces
may
have
been
introduced
to
this
batch
i
dont
know
why
i
always
skip
this
bottle
when
i
shop
but
will
purchase
as
it
is
a
favorite
saison
now
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
sourstyle
saison
that
is
worth
drinking
a
while
all
in
all
a
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
wont
break
the
bank
its
a
nice
brew
to
have
with
grilled
chicken
and
veggies
worth
seeking
out
md
light
crisp
and
very
well
carbonated
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
rough
around
the
edges
and
not
the
most
pleasant
of
tastes
overll
fairly
easy
drinking
though
there
really
wasnt
anything
that
jumped
out
at
me
while
drinking
this
i
wont
be
seeking
his
one
out
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
it
really
has
a
good
balance
of
unique
flavors
overall
a
very
good
beer
nicely
funky
good
points
for
originality
well
executed
i
likes
the
wife
likes
overall
good
drinkability
nothing
is
overwhelming
about
this
beer
the
smooth
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
nice
in
this
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
crisp
and
refreshing
well
crafted
beer
very
sessionable
very
drinkable
give
me
a
lawn
and
a
comfy
chair
and
ill
drink
it
forever
pours
a
clear
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
looks
like
a
macro
lager
but
that
is
where
the
similarities
end
smells
of
green
apples
citrus
spice
funk
slight
floral
or
earthy
hop
in
the
back
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
with
citrus
lemons
and
bitter
oranges
spicy
yeast
slight
barnyard
funk
crisp
refreshing
with
an
earthy
sour
finish
carbonation
is
medium
body
is
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
is
crisp
cirtusy
great
farmhouse
ale
clear
gold
body
with
a
sweet
spicy
and
funky
aroma
mild
barn
yard
notes
too
on
the
palate
it
is
sweet
malt
honey
orange
peel
a
little
funk
and
a
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
very
fun
to
drink
good
to
see
a
saison
with
some
funk
to
it
good
stuff
d
i
had
this
and
the
devotion
sidebyside
both
were
very
similar
to
each
other
and
theyre
somewhat
unremarkable
against
other
saisons
ive
had
even
if
this
were
a
style
i
frequented
i
doubt
id
pick
this
one
up
at
this
price
point
10
per
as
with
carnevale
a
really
well
done
saison
this
one
is
very
different
in
character
almost
like
it
had
a
bit
of
age
on
it
i
wonder
if
it
matured
a
bit
on
the
shelf
regardless
fantastic
beer
d
i
drank
this
when
i
was
sort
of
thirsty
and
it
was
refreshing
and
i
found
myself
drinking
it
quickly
from
the
bottle
it
pours
an
opaque
deep
golden
color
with
an
orange
hue
a
thick
white
head
subsides
to
a
thin
veil
does
my
nose
protest
no
that
is
a
distinct
pepper
on
the
nose
first
followed
up
by
a
strange
sort
of
dryness
finishing
with
some
malty
barnyard
aromas
there
is
no
mistaking
from
the
nose
that
this
one
is
going
to
have
a
distinct
dryness
to
it
when
it
hits
the
mouth
yup
there
it
is
dry
dry
dry
yet
still
sweet
and
there
is
something
unexpected
a
mintiness
that
persists
to
aftertaste
some
wheat
there
too
and
acidic
citrus
tang
and
maybe
some
peach
hiding
out
in
the
distant
background
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
well
brewed
by
all
means
and
for
that
i
give
it
credit
but
for
my
personal
self
i
give
it
some
low
marks
on
taste
and
drinkability
drinkability
yep
a
great
saison
potentially
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
would
have
another
but
the
availability
is
quite
limited
here
in
sc
this
one
along
with
several
other
lost
abbey
offerings
i
obtained
while
on
a
workrelated
trip
to
san
diego
only
got
one
of
these
wish
i
got
more
what
can
i
say
this
one
was
a
huge
letdown
in
the
taste
department
and
i
like
this
style
of
beer
this
one
however
is
one
i
will
not
be
drinking
again
ill
have
to
give
this
another
try
from
a
bottle
to
figure
out
the
savory
smoky
element

d
a
nice
beer
overall
and
my
first
experience
with
this
style
right
out
of
the
gate
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
but
its
complexity
grew
as
i
drink
it
and
drew
me
in
really
fairly
refreshing
after
the
ris
i
just
enjoyed
i
am
very
happy
that
i
finally
decided
to
cork
this
one
even
after
all
this
time
it
still
seems
a
little
bit
sweet
very
drinkable
yet
still
very
sweet
for
the
style
it
needs
to
dry
out
a
bit
pours
a
clear
pale
orange
with
a
high
white
head
that
lingers
leaving
some
fine
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
enticing
grass
pine
dandelion
honey
the
taste
starts
off
with
honey
moves
through
some
nutty
notes
into
a
long
bitter
dandelionstem
finish
the
carbonation
is
fine
the
body
creamy
in
texture
but
none
too
thick
its
extraordinarily
easy
to
drink
one
hell
of
a
saison
glad
i
was
able
to
find
it
overall
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
occasionally
but
it
was
probably
my
least
favorite
lost
abbey
so
far

d
great
balance
of
spicing
carbonation
brings
out
the
great
aroma
and
flavor
of
this
beer
a
nice
saision
not
as
funky
as
its
belgium
counterpart
but
a
very
drinkable
example
with
a
rich
variety
of
flavor
makes
this
a
solid
example
none
the
less
the
taste
never
reaches
the
heights
of
the
scent
but
that
was
difficult
to
accomplish
at
the
outset
an
initial
pear
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
slightly
musty
hay
flavor
finishes
with
a
dry
semi
acidic
and
almost
citrus
like
flavor
voluminous
carbonation
supports
the
mouthfeel
and
increases
the
sharpness
of
the
finish
drinkable
and
enjoyable
even
if
it
isnt
summer
anymore
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
brooklynerschneider
hopfenweisse
in
all
honesty
its
very
juicy
and
hoppy
and
delicious
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
i
never
know
what
to
expect
with
saisons
i
either
like
them
or
hate
them
i
like
this
one
pours
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
huge
white
head
spun
sugar
musty
malt
bananas
clove
and
lemon
in
the
nose
sweet
light
clean
taste
similar
to
a
trippel
great
yeast
ester
bubblegum
and
clove
flavors
and
the
ginger
definitely
enhances
the
taste
here
more
orange
peel
and
pepper
with
lemon
towards
the
back
great
warmweather
beer
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
wellbalanced
saison
alcohol
very
wellcovered
very
drinkable
for
abv
i
could
easily
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
bottles
of
this
especially
in
the
summer
though
very
enjoyable
yearround
notes
from
51207
drinkability
is
also
very
good
especially
for
a
belgian
style
many
times
they
can
be
too
powerful
both
in
flavor
and
in
alcohol
this
one
is
balanced
clean
and
not
overpowering
very
well
done
not
a
bad
drinking
saison
a
bit
too
fruitty
for
me
to
want
to
session
on
good
offering
from
lost
abbey
this
is
extremely
enjoyable
as
something
to
savor
even
though
it
is
of
quite
light
body
sit
back
relax
and
contemplate
the
complexity
of
this
wonderful
offering
either
way
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
definitely
would
go
quite
well
with
some
fried
eggs
or
pommes
frites
drinkability
good
one
and
a
half
years
cellared
picked
up
at
a
pizza
plant
fresh
very
zesty
enjoyable
fresh
tasting
saison
sweetish
malt
made
it
dangerously
drinkable
whitish
colour
way
above
average
mouthfeel
mildly
spiceywith
pepper
ginger
anise
malty
and
yeast
aroma
good
balance
taste
is
spicy
and
peppery
full
and
creamy
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
was
expecting
more
funkiness
to
it
overall
while
not
my
favorite
beer
from
lost
abbey
buy
any
means
it
was
still
more
then
adequate
and
a
pretty
damn
solid
offering
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
again
it
really
came
across
quite
well
and
as
a
side
note
made
an
excellent
marinade
another
impressive
outing
here
from
the
lost
abbey
if
the
cost
was
even
a
little
bit
cheaper
i
would
drink
these
with
some
regularity
as
it
is
i
treat
these
the
same
way
i
treat
dogfish
heads
rotating
beers
averys
imperials
and
lots
of
imports
attempt
to
try
each
of
them
once
privately
and
then
return
to
favorites
for
gettogethers
and
dinners
i
cant
think
of
a
better
american
saison
to
have
with
just
about
any
meal
youd
like
to
cobble
together
overall
lost
abbey
red
barn
ale
is
an
outstanding
saison
that
is
highly
recommended
saisons
are
my
favorite
beer
style
and
this
one
ranks
up
near
the
top
of
my
favorites
overall
a
good
but
not
great
saison
as
i
said
too
dry
and
overspiced
for
my
taste
its
my
first
lost
abbey
got
3
more
in
the
fridge
so
curious
how
those
taste
i
do
recommend
but
dont
sell
the
farm
getting
it
delicious
d
i
have
really
been
into
saisonfarmhouses
lately
they
seem
to
vary
widely
la
has
put
their
unique
influence
on
this
one
if
you
enjoy
this
style
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
if
you
enjoy
lighter
drinking
beers
this
is
a
good
one
if
you
love
summer
this
is
a
good
one
i
hope
this
beer
is
sired
more
often
ill
drink
it
drinkability
is
pretty
high
its
a
delicious
farmhouse
giving
great
flavors
relatively
low
alcohol
makes
for
easy
drinking
just
easy
drinking
smooth
and
refreshing
a
great
treat
indeed
d
excellent
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
could
drink
this
all
day
or
any
day
really
heh
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
huge
frothy
off
white
head
aroma
is
medium
sweet
ginger
lemon
orange
and
dough
flavor
is
ginger
yeasty
some
clove
and
citrus
long
dry
finish
light
to
medium
body
creamy
texture
a
mighty
fine
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
plenty
of
fast
moving
carbonation
as
it
flows
down
this
is
an
easy
drinking
totally
enjoyable
saison
that
goes
well
with
the
summer
season
overall
this
doesnt
quite
blow
me
away
like
previous
bottles
of
spf45
have
in
the
past
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
saison
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
it
great
awesomely
refreshing
brew
i
have
not
had
much
from
the
lost
abbey
due
to
accessability
but
am
extremely
glad
to
be
able
to
enjoy
this
offering
crisp
clean
finish
easy
to
knock
back
several
bottles
of
this
stuff
the
abv
is
not
too
high
and
the
drinking
experience
is
top
notch
dropped
into
a
goblet
produced
a
sparkling
fizzy
pour
that
left
a
cloudy
hazy
golden
honey
like
elixir
with
a
frothy
white
head
sweet
fruit
smell
with
spices
orange
and
clove
i
get
a
little
yeasty
hay
in
there
as
well
very
crisp
almost
tart
start
with
a
little
sweet
along
the
sides
but
a
crisp
dry
finish
very
nice
mouth
feel
a
little
fizzy
the
second
pour
had
some
sediment
that
made
this
beer
look
like
unrefined
honey
big
thanks
to
jeff
for
sharing
this
with
me
d
the
brew
develops
as
it
warms
is
absolutely
a
beautiful
american
example
of
a
refined
belgian
style
highly
recommended
best
shared
with
close
friends
im
looking
forward
to
more
from
lost
abbey
taste
is
smooth
yet
surprisingly
hoppy
does
not
taste
as
sweet
as
it
smells
malt
citrus
fruit
some
spice
pleasant
dry
finish
the
body
starts
off
with
moderate
taste
but
finishes
with
a
dry
almost
crisp
finish
light
carbonation
helps
accentuate
this
overall
a
great
beer
for
a
difficult
style
to
brew
good
job
in
fact
i
think
tomme
arthur
is
possibly
the
most
versatile
and
talented
commercial
brewer
in
the
world
proven
capable
of
remarkably
brewing
virtually
all
styles
what
impresses
me
most
perhaps
above
the
funky
barrel
aged
wild
ales
and
hoppedup
american
brews
is
his
uncanny
ability
to
capture
belgian
ales
this
wonderful
saison
is
yet
another
wonderful
example
of
that
appeared
a
nice
hue
of
red
very
tasty
indeed
spices
bounce
without
overtly
declaring
themselves
mouth
feel
is
of
a
fine
moderate
fizz
that
transports
the
nuances
to
all
areas
of
the
pallate
allowing
simultaneous
epxperience
of
the
elements
that
create
this
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
def
buy
this
one
again
and
again
bottle
purchased
at
ledgers
in
berkeley
for
7
99
pours
a
very
nice
darker
golden
with
just
the
tiniest
wisp
of
haze
a
very
nice
head
that
sticks
around
and
some
excellent
lacing
slightly
sweet
and
somewhat
tangy
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
hint
of
spice
this
smells
more
like
a
tripel
than
a
saison
with
that
hint
of
sweetness
touch
of
clove
and
bit
of
yeasty
tanginess
the
taste
has
some
of
those
same
tripel
elements
but
the
tanginess
is
a
bit
restrained
and
it
tastes
a
bit
cleaner
more
like
a
saison
and
there
is
a
fairly
large
hit
of
white
pepper
and
lighter
touch
of
bitter
orange
peel
right
up
front
the
orange
builds
a
good
bit
through
the
taste
as
does
the
pepper
until
the
finish
which
has
a
bit
more
rounded
yeastiness
fairly
complex
and
ultimately
to
me
it
comes
off
as
an
intriguing
blend
of
tripel
and
saison
with
a
bit
more
aggressive
spicing
than
most
very
nice
and
relatively
complex
summertime
fare
smooth
spicy
and
relatively
addictive
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
like
my
review
of
elysian
the
immortal
ipa
yesterday
it
looks
like
im
the
100th
person
to
review
this
beer
as
well
the
beer
pours
almost
exactly
like
duvel
does
into
this
glass
on
its
bottle
sporting
a
huge
frothy
three
finger
head
i
had
to
wait
a
bit
to
try
this
one
the
head
lasted
throughout
as
a
one
finger
layer
and
left
decent
lacing
aroma
is
loads
of
sweetness
and
spice
great
malt
presence
sweet
fruits
and
slight
funkiness
the
taste
is
dominated
by
spice
and
sweet
malts
crisp
hops
provide
a
nice
spiciness
slight
banana
and
lemon
are
present
as
well
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
that
provides
an
easy
drinking
smoothness
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
farmhouse
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
i
have
to
say
so
far
all
the
hype
ive
heard
about
port
brewing
seems
truly
justified
served
in
my
maudite
tulip
poured
a
hazy
orangegold
with
a
one
inch
white
cap
head
eventually
settles
into
a
light
slick
of
foam
and
bubbles
with
a
solid
band
evident
around
the
shoulders
of
the
glass
some
loose
sheets
of
lacing
evident
during
the
tasting
spicy
nose
as
well
as
the
presence
of
citrus
tart
fruit
green
apples
and
candi
sugar
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
a
slight
pucker
at
the
finish
yeast
and
clove
also
expressed
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
to
mediumbodied
with
lots
of
effervescence
tingling
throughout
the
mouth
good
drinkability
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
a
nice
offering
nonetheless
d
love
saisons
in
the
summer
this
was
a
good
beer
but
a
pain
to
get
my
hands
on
hennepin
is
just
as
good
if
not
better
and
much
easier
to
get
still
have
not
had
a
bad
beer
from
these
guys
drinkability
is
fine
but
it
doesnt
impress
me
enough
to
seek
out
for
a
revisit
it
was
a
bit
to
spicy
and
boozy
to
drink
with
speed
or
refresh
like
i
look
for
in
the
style
d
one
of
the
easier
offerings
to
find
from
the
lost
abbey
it
seems
to
take
dupont
as
a
template
and
then
add
its
own
unique
complexity
and
character
to
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
made
in
america
without
a
doubt
and
would
work
great
with
a
multitude
of
meals
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
ill
still
give
it
points
for
good
hopping
and
good
finish
notes
my
first
bottle
of
lost
abbey
that
ive
tried
proved
to
be
okay
i
drank
an
angels
share
but
quite
frankly
dont
remember
how
it
tasted
im
interested
in
trying
some
of
the
others
from
this
highly
touted
brewery
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
frankly
it
just
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
hennepin
750ml
bottle
courtesy
of
kingg
thanks
this
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
with
a
head
that
quickly
subsided
into
a
ring
of
white
bubbles
the
aroma
is
thick
with
spice
but
i
cant
tell
you
what
kind
there
is
also
some
orange
peel
type
smell
the
flavor
has
a
faint
candy
quality
and
some
other
flavors
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
there
seems
to
a
be
a
hop
bitterness
and
this
definitely
has
a
rustic
farmhouse
feel
to
it
this
is
damn
good
and
it
hit
the
spot
perfectly
on
a
95
degree
day
very
complex
and
another
amazing
offering
from
lost
abbey
d
decent
drinkability
with
6
7
the
750
wont
be
too
much
d
a
nice
earthy
saison
the
low
carbonation
is
a
bit
off
putting
to
me
but
i
guess
you
could
think
of
it
as
sort
of
like
a
cask
saison
update
june
2009
bottle
from
my
brother
dave
thanks
its
highly
cabonated
but
a
slight
funks
is
there
making
it
finished
dry
it
is
a
saison
and
the
spicy
taste
is
great
up
the
flavor
score
by
12
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
the
thing
is
i
dont
think
i
can
stop
sipping
a
vacation
in
a
bottle
another
good
beer
from
lost
abbey
and
one
of
my
favorite
american
made
saisons
doesnt
quite
have
the
funk
i
enjoy
so
much
from
some
belgians
but
im
digging
it
nonetheless
id
pick
up
a
few
of
these
tonight
if
lost
abbey
distributed
out
this
way
thanks
again
dana
d
a
good
saison
id
have
again
d
highly
drinkable
beer
but
most
saisons
are
this
beer
was
enjoyable
but
wouldnt
stand
out
in
a
crowd
overall
i
love
what
lost
abbey
does
they
brew
wonderfu
beers
that
are
highly
sought
after
for
good
reason
add
this
one
to
their
world
class
lineup
i
would
love
to
have
another
bottle
for
a
warm
summers
night
while
relaxing
in
the
hot
tub
lucid
golden
billowy
white
head
nice
legs
and
lacing
aromas
of
barnyard
belgin
yeast
funk
notes
mix
with
fresh
breaked
bread
lemon
zest
and
coriander
taste
is
smooth
with
a
nice
funky
bread
spice
and
yeast
mix
going
on
hops
are
muted
mouthfeel
is
zesty
medium
bodied
very
very
drinkable
a
nice
saison
but
not
overly
complex
or
amazing
for
my
money
the
carnevale
kills
this
one
overall
very
nice
flavorful
example
of
the
style
but
not
best
of
it
or
from
lost
abbey
d
i
look
forward
to
having
more
the
abv
is
appropriate
and
not
the
typical
saison
in
terms
of
taste
but
cant
pinpoint
why
still
worth
getting
out
and
trying
this
one
first
lost
abbey
wondering
what
others
have
to
offer
easily
the
best
of
the
yearround
offerings
from
lost
abbey
and
the
others
arent
bad
lost
found
is
my
favorite
dubbel
in
the
us
this
is
as
nearperfect
a
saisonbeer
that
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
as
expected
another
top
shelf
offering
from
lost
abbey
dont
know
if
you
would
find
a
better
us
representation
of
this
saison
style
id
share
this
with
friends
over
a
nice
dinner
when
i
first
read
about
the
lost
abbey
beers
i
didnt
believe
all
the
hype
then
i
spotted
them
in
a
little
store
with
a
large
price
tag
when
i
finally
got
over
my
stupidity
i
learned
that
the
lost
abbey
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
brewers
we
have
here
in
the
u
s
dont
waist
time
like
i
did
go
get
one
now
overall
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
the
result
of
my
quest
does
not
disappoint
the
brew
is
medium
bodied
robust
complex
and
infinitely
drinkable
i
say
this
after
drinking
this
750ml
bottle
on
my
own
over
the
course
of
a
few
hours
im
almost
finished
with
the
beer
as
i
write
this
and
i
definitely
want
more
but
there
is
no
more
and
ill
have
to
settle
for
a
glass
of
water
and
dreams
of
visiting
the
little
old
stone
brewery
now
lost
abbey
again
one
day
but
seeing
everything
as
new
drinking
it
from
the
affligem
chalice
my
younger
brother
gave
me
he
gave
me
the
beer
as
well
notes
good
but
not
great
most
american
breweries
seem
to
have
a
hard
time
with
saisons
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
bit
too
much
overt
spice
for
my
taste
but
an
enjoyable
and
very
interesting
beer
drinkability
is
sky
high
if
i
could
i
would
gladly
drink
drafts
of
this
all
day
on
a
sunny
day
in
coastal
california
as
it
so
happens
im
drinking
a
lone
bottle
on
a
cold
rainy
day
in
new
york
either
way
the
senses
are
happy
poured
from
a
bottle
into
tulip
glass
nice
goldenorange
color
with
huge
white
bubbly
head
good
lacing
smells
of
spice
coriander
good
first
full
flavor
sip
spices
hops
good
bitter
feel
on
sides
of
tongue
beer
smooths
as
you
drink
settles
down
nicely
warms
as
you
go
also
good
mouthfeel
and
it
keeps
its
flavor
long
after
swallowing
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
a
nice
dinner
nice
complex
and
refreshing
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
i
wish
i
had
another
this
pours
a
light
peachy
yellow
with
a
little
bit
of
a
chill
haze
decent
head
with
moderate
lace
nose
is
of
wheat
and
light
malts
with
some
light
apple
and
barnyard
funk
first
taste
wheat
dominates
with
alot
of
subtle
spice
flavors
and
some
maltiness
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
and
not
overly
carbonated
like
some
american
saisons
drinkability
is
very
high
a
great
shot
at
a
saison
from
a
great
brewing
co
recommended
d
i
could
have
a
few
glasses
without
tiring
of
this
brew
pretty
nice
smell
is
a
little
funky
earthy
grassy
a
little
spice
in
there
too
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
but
has
a
nice
combination
of
fruityness
and
grassyearthiness
mouthfeel
was
light
and
refreshing
with
moderate
carbonation
and
this
was
very
drinkable
actually
almost
too
drinkable
as
it
was
gone
so
fast
that
it
was
hard
to
enjoy
pours
a
foggy
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
very
strong
with
yeast
flavor
is
yeasty
as
well
with
a
strong
dough
quality
to
it
and
a
very
tangy
edge
feel
is
good
not
too
thin
drinkable
indeed
a
very
decent
saison
just
came
off
a
bit
too
tangy
for
my
tastes
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
rich
golden
color
there
was
just
a
hint
of
haze
and
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
to
it
the
aroma
is
very
fragrant
earthy
musty
yeasty
and
grassy
the
taste
is
very
good
somewhat
fruity
grassy
spicy
just
a
mixed
bag
working
very
well
together
a
very
good
saison
this
beer
was
quite
clear
with
a
gorgeous
deep
gold
orangish
hue
and
generous
fluffy
white
cap
the
head
was
composed
mostly
of
large
bubbles
that
had
great
retention
and
left
chunky
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
complex
aroma
with
notes
of
earthy
grass
lemon
zest
tropical
fruit
and
delicate
malt
there
was
a
bit
of
mild
pepper
initially
but
this
became
more
of
a
general
spiciness
over
the
course
of
the
bottle
moderate
bitterness
balanced
nicely
with
significant
fruitiness
malty
base
and
bready
yeasty
middle
it
finished
with
a
bit
of
pepper
then
grassy
floral
hop
bitterness
lingered
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
high
side
the
texture
was
very
nice
this
beer
was
solid
from
start
to
finish
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spiciness
great
stuff
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
it
had
nice
head
orange
color
about
what
you
would
expect
from
this
style
of
beer
the
nose
is
interesting
i
read
in
a
previous
review
that
a
bubble
gum
smell
is
what
hits
you
initially
i
would
say
that
is
a
very
good
description
bubble
gum
maltiness
cloves
and
other
spices
the
taste
is
a
good
combination
of
yeasty
spicy
malt
this
is
a
good
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
on
par
for
the
style
good
beer
d
a
likable
version
of
a
style
i
really
had
little
experience
with
before
a
trip
to
belgium
this
compares
favorably
with
some
good
ones
ive
had
though
cant
match
the
awesomeness
of
the
likes
of
dupont
and
others
red
barn
is
one
ill
have
again
im
sure
especially
now
that
lost
abbey
makes
it
to
washington
is
oregon
next
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
very
refreshing
citrus
aroma
with
a
nice
peppery
element
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
lemony
zest
as
well
as
a
mild
earthiness
this
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
saisons
ive
had
in
some
time
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
its
extremely
smooth
and
loaded
with
tons
of
flavor
d
all
hail
tomme
this
beer
is
a
great
drink
full
of
spicy
and
funky
flavors
bitter
and
tart
and
delicious
nicely
done
o
pretty
good
i
like
the
avant
garde
more
but
this
one
is
also
a
good
brew
wish
the
flavor
was
a
little
stronger
i
think
this
would
be
better
in
the
summer
as
opposed
to
during
this
cold
snap
were
in
right
now
typical
lost
abbey
presentation
belgian
bomber
caged
and
corked
no
freshness
info
to
be
had
and
an
artistic
label
this
one
pours
clear
medium
golden
amber
with
alot
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
head
is
a
rocky
long
lasting
kind
of
thing
eggshell
in
color
and
thick
with
spotty
ringed
and
well
developed
lacing
left
behind
nose
is
all
about
a
bunch
of
fresh
fruits
some
light
pepper
and
belgian
yeasty
goodness
full
flavor
brew
more
fruityness
melon
pears
apples
spice
pepper
coriander
honey
bananas
complex
and
interesting
stuff
lovely
final
pour
loaded
with
sediment
and
nutty
yeast
this
went
great
with
some
peppery
goat
cheese
on
toast
and
some
nuts
agreed
lost
abbey
is
into
the
pantheon
of
top
notch
u
s
brewers
great
stuff
go
get
some
and
enjoy
i
can
no
longer
deny
the
obvious
even
though
i
didnt
think
there
was
any
room
the
lost
abbey
port
brewing
has
exploded
into
the
upper
reaches
of
my
top10
breweries
in
the
u
s
list
theyll
almost
certainly
be
a
permanent
fixture
as
long
as
they
continue
to
brew
outstanding
beer
like
red
barn
ale
as
far
as
im
concerned
tomme
arthur
vinnie
cilurzo
and
rob
todd
comprise
the
holy
trinity
of
belgian
brewing
americanstyle
i
can
see
why
this
came
so
highly
recommended
nothing
exciting
and
firey
but
very
well
integrated
and
balanced
flavours
do
good
justice
to
the
saison
style
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
newworld
flair
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
hints
of
copper
the
750ml
bottle
is
corked
and
caged
with
the
head
is
portly
and
off
white
in
color
the
texture
creamy
as
it
fades
to
nothingness
the
lace
provides
a
concealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
rich
in
spices
hints
of
peach
nice
malt
backing
crisp
and
fresh
to
the
nose
start
is
sweet
and
malty
the
top
is
moderate
in
feel
finish
has
a
nice
moderate
acidity
hops
are
present
and
the
fruity
sweetness
combines
with
the
dry
aftertaste
a
great
series
of
beers
this
lost
abbey
d
overall
this
is
a
respectible
saison
style
from
a
local
american
brewery
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
could
put
down
3
or
4
of
these
easily
i
consider
this
type
of
brew
my
personal
coors
light
i
love
that
lost
abbey
aka
port
brewing
co
is
located
in
socal
there
beers
are

color
with
a
shallow
loose
white
bubbly
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly

and
some

observed
the
smell
is
a
fragrant
bananapear
yeasty
combination
light
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonated
the
inviting
flavor
is
earthy
and
gently
fruity
with
a
peppery
spice
component
while
the
mouth
finishes
dry
the
pepper
flavor
lingers
a
nice
drinker
with
a

to
consider
the

surprisingly
warming

otherwise

dthis
is
delicious
i
love
nyc

i
miss

i
hope
they
expand
the
distribution

great
beer
all
around
really
reminds
me
of
the
first
saison
i
ever
had
i
was
blown
away
then
and
still
am
by
this
us
version
great
stuff
d
this
is
a
good
sipper
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
glass
at
a
time
senses
overload
with
spices
that
complement
the
flavor
but
take
away
from
the
drinkability

another
awesome

from

very
tasty

drinkable

missing
slightly

watery

nice
puckering

on

an

factor
with

out
with

an
exceptional
saison
that
just
blows
me
away
with
its
rich
complexity
750
ml
gurgles
forth
with
a
robust
push
of
lightly
hazed
gold
atop
a
froth
of
soft
soap
fresh
with
an
offwhite
hue
the
aroma
precludes
a
soapy
ambiance
with
christmas
spiced
potpourri
warm
hexanous
aromatics
and
bubbly
cauldrons
into
the
mouth
an
immediate
blast
of
rising
bright
fruitiness
meeting
headstrong
with
a
mouthful
of
malt
and
mild
middle
eastern
spicings
a
seemingly
classic
saison
build
with
gentle
sweeping
malt
sugars
high
bright
and
freshening
yeast
character
melding
into
a
pile
of
nose
bristling
spice
dust
hops
round
out
the
back
with
a
palate
closing
grassy
complexity
if
any
faults
fall
upon
this
beer
its
that
the
spices
seem
a
little
muddled
and
artificial
but
i
think
the
yeast
help
cover
it
palate
is
perfection
with
a
nice
light
airy
body
to
carry
all
of
the
heavenly
scents
and
flavors
through
good
malt
configuration
delicious
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
very
pleasant
it
has
hints
of
fruity
malts
and
spices
taste
is
a
nice
medley
of
fruits
spices
and
finishes
with
an
interesting
peppery
bite
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
and
perhaps
less
dry
than
others
i
have
sampled
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
but
it
has
that
belgian
yeast
smothness
that
makes
it
very
nice
overall
drinkabilty
is
very
good
i
enjoyed
sampling
this
at
ajs
and
i
am
very
happy
that
i
tried
a
full
bottle
i
believe
this
is
the
best
american
made
saison
i
have
had
to
date
bottle
poured
a
light
beige
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
funky
yeast
with
some
nice
spices
and
light
ester
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
sweet
fruit
notes
as
well
as
some
spices
and
the
funky
yeast
average
body
with
great
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
own
palate
but
still
enjoyable
overall
an
excellent
beer
from
port
brewing
the
taste
makes
me
want
to
keep
going
back
for
more
theres
enough
going
on
here
with
the
fruitiness
and
light
malts
that
dont
get
boring
this
beer
is
surprising
and
very
interesting
the
aroma
put
me
off
a
bit
but
like
a
fine
cheese
the
flavour
more
than
made
up
for
it
but
red
barn
is
a
very
very
good
beer
i
would
drink
one
again
in
a
second
and
ahead
of
most
belgianbrewed
beers
of
the
same
style
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
orange
with
a
reliable
half
inch
head
there
is
a
goodly
amount
of
lacing
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sweet
yeasty
smell
with
a
bit
of
hop
tinge
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
have
you
believe
there
are
some
discernible
spices
a
subtle
sweetness
with
the
best
part
of
this
beer
happening
in
the
middle
the
end
and
aftertaste
is
a
bit
tart
with
a
bit
too
much
of
a
hoppy
bite
this
beer
is
a
medium
bodied
ale
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable

750ml
bottle
sampled
in
monks
with
mussels
on
a
saturday
afternoon
the
color
is
an
opaque
gold
hue
with
a
tall
head
very
pleasant
spicy
flavors
in
the
mouth
with
a
hint
of
citrus
there
wasnt
much
scent
associated
with
the
beer
though
which
may
be
why
it
didnt
reach
that
top
level
of
complexity
for
me
still
quite
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
trying
perhaps
i
should
add
that
drinking
this
beer
in
monks
im
probably
putting
it
up
against
some
fairly
tough
standards
as
far
as
american
beers
in
this
style
go
you
cant
do
much
better
poured

honey
a
little
thin
in
body
with
medium
to
moderate
carbonation
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
grab
some
everything
about
this
beer
seems
just
right
for
the
style
and
it
does
it
very
well
a
good

for
those
who
have
a
taste
for
them

one
of

from

an
almost

clear

with
a
surprisingly
short

head
whas
up
with
that
nice
smells
of
very
light
citrus
and
pepper
not
much
funk
or
more
precisely
none
taste
is
dominated
by
that
peppery
spiciness
and
only
the
slightness
sense
of
sweetness
mouthfeels
seems
thin
and
even
at
this
low
alcohol
that
does
make
an
appearance
a
buddy
i
shared
this
with
remarked
that
this
does
not
seem
done
definately
not
a
favorite
in
the
saison
category
for
me
this
almost
seems
a
higher
spiced
and
alcoholic
witte
orangey
amber
topped
with
a
thick
puff
of
white
head
good
clarity
the
head
settles
down
quickly
diminishing
further
into
a
weak
collar
not
uncommon
with
belgian
styles
the
color
is
quite
attractive
with
a
soft
glow
about
it
very
spicy
aroma
the
yeast
apparently
putting
in
double
shifts
to
make
this
thing
happen
peppery
and
zesty
with
a
creamy
malt
underlayer
some
woodsy
notes
maybe
from
hops
but
its
hard
to
tell
soft
peachy
fruit
and
a
bit
of
clovey
spicephenols
the
flavor
opens
up
with
a
light
and
bouyant
texture
the
carbonation
tingling
with
fine
bubbles
dancing
wildly
initially
mild
and
sweet
kinda
dingy
in
that
belgian
malt
way
just
toasty
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
peachy
pear
fruit
then
the
finish
rides
in
slightly
before
its
cue
parading
about
with
amusingly
garish
spiciness
very
peppery
and
clovey
achieving
something
akin
to
a
winter
warmer
in
a
gingerrootcinnamon
kinda
way
i
wonder
if
this
is
spiced
and
with
what
coriander
kinda
witbierish
too
strange
brew
adequate
sweetness
the
balance
mostly
served
through
the
yeast
character
with
little
discernable
hoppage
aside
from
a
vague
flowery
tint
ends
off
slightly
dry
with
enough
residual
sugar
to
keep
this
just
to
the
side
of
sweet
pleasing
and
enjoyable
if
maybe
a
bit
heavy
handed
with
the
spiciness
its
like
a
saison
running
on
jet
fuel
sampled
at
the
monks
cafe
lost
abbey
beer
dinner
a
few
nights
ago
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
citrusy
lemon
orange
and
has
some
spice
nuances
also
the
taste
is
a
bit
earthy
and
also
has
nice
touches
of
the
citrus
and
spice
maybe
some
corriander
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
and
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
the
spiciness
is
nice
but
limits
the
drinkability
on
this
one
a
bit
taste
solid
solid
body
that
hits
you
right
from
the
start
only
to
give
way
to
the
spicy
bready
yeast
flavors
in
the
middle
and
cuts
dry
with
a
resinous
hop
finale
carbonation
is
just
the
way
i
like
it
vivid
and
tingly
im
a
sucker
for
saisons
this
one
hit
all
the
right
buttons
for
me
received
in
a
trade
from
ba
dogfoodog
this
lost
abbey
brown
bomber
was
caged
corked
and
had
a
painting
of
a
red
barn
basking
in
a
sunny
summer
day
the
beer
came
out
peach
colored
and
very
cloudy
and
the
head
atop
it
was
craggy
and
durable
the
smell
was
light
and
floral
and
not
a
lot
of
spices
were
detected
in
the
nose
typical
of
the
american
versions
of
the
style
earthy
yeastiness
was
mostly
absent
as
well
taste
was
sweeter
than
most
authentic
belgian
saisons
with
floral
and
herbal
flavors
from
the
added
ingredients
attempting
to
balance
things
out
delicious
overall
but
had
they
used
a
strain
of
yeast
that
ate
up
more
of
the
residual
sugars
and
dried
the
flavor
up
more
this
would
have
been
a
lot
more
refreshing
i
am
thinking
this
beer
is
more
of
appropriate
for
fall
than
summer
thicker
than
anticipated
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
was
medium
at
best
a
very
charming
but
off
the
style
saison
easy
to
drink
saison
but
i
dont
really
think
that
this
is
as
good
as
saison
dupont
or
hennepin
overall
i
have
never
been
disapointed
with
anything
that
tomme
arthur
has
made
this
is
no
exception
this
beer
is
great
tomme
should
be
brewing
in
belgium
this
would
be
very
very
refreshing
on
a
summers
day
poured
in
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed
a
12
beige
head
over
the
almost
clear
golden
amber
brew
head
falls
gradually
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
spicy
with
fruity
tartness
tickling
the
nose
as
well
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
spicy
malt
sweetness
upfront
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
then
some
tartness
enters
and
carries
on
through
the
aftertaste
kind
of
muddied
a
bit
for
me
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
bit
prickly
though
and
drinkability
goes
along
in
the
same
vein
not
quite
all
i
expected
here
but
still
a
solid
and
interesting
offering
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
nice
warm
springsummer
day
or
any
day
in
san
diego
wouldnt
appeal
to
much
to
me
in
the
cold
desert
during
the
winter
its
a
very
tasty
ale
and
enjoying
one
is
a
great
pleasure
but
one
glass
is
enough
for
me
very
decent
beer
i
do
think
it
is
better
than
some
not
all
belgian
saisons
currently
being
made
another
very
wellcrafted
offering
from
port
brewing
notes
while
i
like
a
light
saison
to
ring
in
the
hotter
seasons
this
seems
more
suited
as
a
nightcapper
not
a
knock
in
the
slightest
but
just
for
my
notes
i
would
enjoy
this
more
off
season
the
taste
has
much
of
the
same
flavor
with
some
fruity
apple
notes
its
fairly
sweet
and
tangy
overall
light
and
foamy
mouthfeel
with
forceful
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
was
expecting
a
more
impressive
saison
however
considering
the
price
9
and
port
brewings
reputation
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
drier
with
some
more
complexity
not
bad
and
it
certainly
wont
keep
me
from
trying
the
other
lost
abbey
brews
purchased
plaza
liquors
d
very
easy
to
drink
like
all
other
saisons
kind
of
scary
when
i
have
a
whole
growler
ahead
of
me
very
refreshing
and
smooth
follows
the
style
well
like
i
said
above
just
a
really
good
beer
this
is
one
of
the
most
intriguing
beers
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
not
sure
how
drinkable
it
is
but
i
would
gladly
have
another
mouth
exactly
like
smells
with
addition
of
white
grape
and
some
alcoholic
ethers
and
warmth
sweet
malt
notes
yeast
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
that
creates
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
only
let
down
is
the
mouthfeel
weaker
carbonation
that
thins
more
so
as
it
passes
through
however
flavor
is
so
good
its
still
very
drinkable
very
delightful
saison
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
many
thanks
to
lou91
for
sending
this
delicious
beer
bottom
line
this
is
a
wonderful
saison
from
yet
another
small
brewery
in
california
fantastic
d
sort
of
a
triplesaison
blend
very
well
balanced
between
citrus
spice
and
funk
quite
enjoyable
last
swigs
one
of
the
top
5
unique
saisons
ive
ever
tried
i
just
wanted
to
glug
this
down
with
its
bold
richness
to
describe
the
diference
between
this
and
saison
dupont
id
say
this
is
sugary
sweeter
and
less
bone
jarring
dry
but
some
similarities
are
inescapable
worth
hanging
around
for
more
of
this
note
this
is
basically
the
same
recipe
as
the
pizza
port
spf
45
and
will
be
available
from
the
lost
abbey
and
all
pizza
port
locations
soon
o
very
good
saison
with
a
little
twist
this
bottle
is
almost
a
year
old
now
and
is
tasting
just
like
they
said
it
would
final
score
3
85
nice
spring
saison
tastes
like
theres
a
bright
golden
haze
on
the
meadow
overall
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
saison
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
the
taste
follows
suit
with
an
earthy
bready
character
a
touch
of
spice
but
mainly
a
very
expressive
belgian
yeast
strain
borders
on
tart
but
never
really
gets
there
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
feel
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
belgian
style
ale
overall
this
is
a
really
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
saison
theres
a
cleanness
to
the
funk
and
a
smoothness
from
the
additional
sweetness
the
peach
character
is
what
sets
it
apart
and
its
a
fine
character
for
a
saison
very
nice
indeed
overall
the
spice
is
really
nice
on
this
not
too
harsh
where
it
kills
the
taste
just
a
nice
smooth
brew
all
the
way
through
o
first
thing
i
noticed
when
tasting
was
that
i
wished
it
had
the
same
spice
presence
in
the
flavor
as
it
had
in
the
nose
some
coriander
in
the
flavor
would
have
really
made
this
pop
all
the
flavors
in
here
are
nice
and
this
is
a
seriously
good
drinker
would
have
just
like
some
spice
some
more
funk
to
harmonize
the
sweet
green
fruits
that
being
said
this
is
still
quite
delicious
a
good
saison
for
sure
id
have
it
again
overall
pretty
solid
saison
with
a
little
funk
and
tart
to
it
i
dig
it
overall
nice
juxtaposition
of
flavors
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
trippel
if
you
ask
mewhich
is
probably
why
i
am
digging
this
o
love
this
saison
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
reason
it
is
strictly
just
a
simply
brewed
saison
nothing
extra
everything
that
comes
through
in
the
flavor
and
smell
is
from
the
yeast
doing
its
marvelous
job
pleasant
and
enjoyable
excellent
farmhouse
ale
from
tomme
and
the
abbey
overall
not
bad
but
very
little
brett
age
didnt
seem
to
do
much
o
overall
this
was
a
fun
beer
the
brett
is
a
bit
too
soft
for
me
still
nice
to
see
where
this
beer
goes
terrific
pours
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
large
soapy
white
head
smells
like
hay
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
solid
barnyard
funkiness
taste
is
a
bit
dry
with
some
mild
bitter
citrus
and
hay
funk
and
a
subtle
touch
of
sweetness
behind
it
all
for
balance
mediumbodied
with
a
crisp
texture
and
active
mouthcarbonation
lost
abbey
carnevale
finishes
wtih
a
drying
almost
woody
sensation
overall
a
very
solid
brew
the
brettanomyces
add
a
nice
extra
level
in
the
aroma
mainly
with
some
accents
on
the
taste
maybe
with
some
more
time
the
yeasty
funkiness
will
come
out
some
more
overall
an
impressive
beer
even
though
i
do
not
detect
any
brett
qualities
the
flavor
begins
with
raw
grain
flavor
not
as
sour
as
most
saisons
strong
black
pepper
finish
this
is
an
easier
saison
than
most
to
drink
theres
nothing
overthetop
about
this
except
the
long
aftertaste
the
body
leans
to
the
thin
side
like
most
of
this
style
the
carbonation
is
very
high
o
this
one
let
me
down
thought
the
appearance
and
the
smell
was
terrific
but
it
completely
misses
the
mark
in
my
book
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
real
easy
drinking
saison
from
lost
abbey
it
always
surprises
me
that
their
regular
offerings
are
so
interesting
and
enjoyable
good
choice
by
me
slightly
hazy
golden
colored
brew
champaignlike
effervescence
is
notable
in
the
the
appearance
a
floral
funk
and
tartness
is
notable
some
earthy
barnyard
and
appleskin
scents
stand
out
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
the
tartness
and
funk
alongside
sugar
in
the
mid
taste
full
in
body
and
a
solid
bitterness
in
the
finish
smells
sour
fruity
and
initial
pour
has
massive
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
a
bit
dissappinted
with
first
sip
that
tasted
watery
but
got
better
with
the
second
sip
and
tasted
some
good
slightly
bitter
fruits
and
a
lingering
taste
in
a
good
way
its
good
not
great
but
id
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
decent
brew
emulates
the
belgian
sister
very
well
rich
fruity
huge
head
this
is
as
much
a
tripel
as
it
is
a
saison
a
beautiful
marriage
of
the
two
the
pour
is
hazy
and
golden
with
just
a
finger
or
two
of
white
lasting
head
that
leaves
wedding
style
rings
on
the
edges
of
the
chalice
the
nose
is
sweet
and
yeasty
big
high
gravity
malt
body
with
some
attitude
also
more
booze
than
it
really
is
comes
through
i
taste
belgian
cultured
yeast
before
any
farmhouse
funk
and
there
is
that
malty
sweetness
of
a
classic
tripel
cornsyrupy
in
a
good
way
and
lots
of
carbonation
and
body
this
is
sort
of
a
genre
bender
dry
and
sweet
both
unusual
in
that
way
maybe
a
little
overpriced
but
its
complexity
is
appreciated
here
really
round
and
smooth
in
the
feel
i
wish
it
would
quit
straddling
the
fence
between
a
farmy
saison
and
a
sugary
tripel
it
cant
quite
decide
and
that
hurts
it
a
little
this
is
a
beer
without
a
true
identity
but
one
with
plenty
of
unique
flavors
and
a
mind
of
its
own
on
tap
at
cheeky
monk
on
colfax
for
more
than
its
worth
but
it
tastes
good
and
itll
drink
forever
lost
abbey
is
back
cloudy
strawyellow
pour
with
a
huge
puff
of
white
head
that
took
a
while
to
settle
to
a
servable
size
but
was
pretty
tame
after
that
barnyard
funk
in
the
nose
hints
of
citrus
pith
and
fruity
esters
funky
taste
echoing
the
aroma
toasted
grains
notes
of
peppery
spice
and
citrus
pith
lightmedium
body
with
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
pretty
typical
for
the
style
all
around
if
you
like
standard
saisons
youll
like
this
o
slightly
more
bitter
than
the
typical
saison
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
interesting
as
the
wonderful
aroma
overall
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
reasonably
priced
do
this
attractivelooking
saison
exhibits
some
potent
belgian
yeast
character
against
otherwise
traditional
and
unremarkable
sensory
qualities
o
a
nice
saison
i
like
how
the
brett
plays
with
this
style
that
said
the
taste
was
a
little
off
balance
sweet
then
dry
fruity
then
earthy
interesting
but
i
also
felt
it
was
lacking
continuity
o
my
first
from
the
lost
abbey
a
decent
saison
great
with
swiss
cheese
ready
for
carnival
season
now
pretty
classy
actually
not
a
huge
measure
of
saison
or
brett
yeast
character
but
very
neat
and
technically
sound
satisfying
o
the
malt
doesnt
have
much
of
the
pils
character
and
the
bit
of
sweetness
is
a
little
unusual
for
the
style
but
it
comes
together
well
and
accentuates
the
fruitiness
the
bitterness
has
a
bit
of
orange
zest
character
to
which
lingers
a
bit
in
the
finish
but
would
pair
well
with
simple
preparations
of
fish
like
sushi
or
a
pan
fried
with
a
light
lemon
sauce
does
not
pair
well
with
marshmallows
by
the
way
o
weird
beer
not
a
huge
fan
might
like
to
try
it
again
though
i
feel
i
wasnt
able
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
overall
a
very
nice
saison
im
going
to
set
my
last
few
bottles
from
this
vintage
aside
and
let
the
brett
do
some
work
i
like
this
beer
but
not
as
much
as
some
other
saisons
a
little
too
bitter
and
that
upsets
the
balance
and
all
of
the
other
wonderful
nuances
present
very
worth
trying
and
any
flaws
are
minimum
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
highly
tasty
and
drinkable
saison
i
would
gladly
have
this
beer
again
o
this
is
a
nice
and
refreshing
saison
the
subtle
hints
of
funk
make
it
quite
interesting
to
drink
o
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
funkiness
the
brett
flavors
are
very
complementary
and
do
not
dominate
or
overpower
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
good
amounts
of
complexity
d
not
a
bad
saison
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
overall
as
this
one
is
average
at
best
perhaps
a
bit
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
help
meld
the
flavors
and
provide
much
needed
complexity
the
taste
may
be
a
little
too
spicy
for
my
tastes
it
covers
some
of
the
complexity
but
really
im
being
picky
and
this
is
a
good
beer
the
hops
are
spicy
and
american
providing
a
twist
onthe
common
saison
an
effervescent
mouthfeel
with
tiny
belgian
bubbles
a
solid
beer
from
a
great
brewery
carnevale
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
the
monstrous
pile
of
foam
atop
the
beer
maxes
out
at
about
four
fingers
in
height
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
very
good
but
neither
are
quite
on
par
with
the
very
best
of
the
style
the
nose
has
lots
of
earthy
brett
funk
but
with
a
light
peppery
aroma
present
as
well
the
flavor
profile
follows
a
similar
layout
with
the
brett
profile
having
a
prominent
wet
hay
barnyard
essence
to
it
the
pepperlike
phenols
are
muted
and
in
the
background
but
definitely
present
the
label
advertises
american
hops
but
outside
of
a
gentle
bitterness
i
dont
find
evidence
of
any
the
body
is
nice
and
dry
and
the
carbonation
has
plenty
of
life
to
it
spot
on
mouthfeel
for
a
saison
i
really
enjoyed
this
relatively
fresh
bottle
o
carnevale
and
id
be
curious
to
see
what
its
like
with
a
little
bit
more
age
on
it
o
as
this
is
my
first
lost
abbey
brew
i
am
very
satifsfied
too
often
do
saison
attempts
have
only
thin
yeasty
qualities
carnevale
makes
for
a
thicker
fuller
version
enjoyable
bottle
this
is
a
real
nice
saison
has
the
good
feel
with
it
along
with
having
a
slight
bit
of
bretty
touch
to
it

extremely
smooth

on
i
had
no
idea
this
had
brett
in
it
when
i
bought
it
online
but
the
outcome
was
fantastic
the
color
of
a
hazy
wheat
yellow
with
a

of
white

and
a
fair
amount

taste
had
the
flavor
of
carbonated

hops
and
a
bittersweet
finish
on
the
aftertaste
that
lingered
for
quite
awhile
the
longer
you
sip
this
ale
the
more
complex
flavors
you
got
on
your
palate
overall
a
refreshingly
different
saison
with
a
nice
sour
spicy
taste
that
had
an
outstanding
blending
with
the
hops
o
havent
had
an
aged
saison
prior
to
this
review
but
i
am
already
a
fan
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
saison
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
bottle
of
this
and
hope
its
as
good
as
on
tap
overall
not
my
favorite
from
lost
abbey
but
having
said
that
still
a
stellar
brew
heads
and
shoulders
above
most
o
overall
a
nice
level
of
funky
sourness
that
is
balanced
just
right
not
to
pungent
not
to
light
but
finds
that
sweet
spot
drink
ability
wise
while
still
giving
you
enough
to
appreciate
per
style
this
is
light
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
the
body
is
light
and
has
somewhat
coarse
carbonation

complex

tasty
brew
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
one
saisons
are
similar
across
brewers
and
this
one
doesnt
stand
out
really
o
pretty
sessionable
farmhouse
ale
not
my
favorite
of
styles
but
this
was
refreshing
after
a
long
day
o
i
could
see
this
maybe
being
good
if
you
enjoyed
this
kinda
thing
but
it
is
deffinatly
not
my
style
to
much
belgian
yeast
for
me
a
complex
brew
with
lots
of
fruit
rind
flavor
enough
tart
like
quality
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
to
remind
you
its
a
saison
traditional
yet
innovative
yeast
bite
really
takes
away
from
the
beer
though
unfortunately
ruining
its
drinkability
a
bit
b
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
its
got
such
a
wonderful
balance
between
tart
bitter
and
sweet
that
i
loved
it
was
refreshing
and
looked
and
smelled
very
inviting
i
really
recommend
this
brew
to
people
that
like
the
style
and
softer
more
refreshing
tasting
brews
cheers
refreshing
but
a
bit
heavy
for
a
hot
summer
day
excellent
beer
overall
cloves
citrus
fruits
yeast
with
a
little
caramel
sweetness
clean
and
refined
yet
uninteresting
in
the
saison
world
in
my
opinion
delicious
yet
safe
this
beverage
yields
a
great
light
yet
fluffy
saison
feel
but
lacks
in
depth
id
have
a
second
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
great
saison
im
not
much
of
a
saison
fan
got
turned
off
by
the
super
spicy
offerings
but
this
is
mellow
not
many
spices
in
this
lost
abbey
let
the
yeast
and
hops
bring
out
the
spice
in
this
one
pick
this
up
if
you
find
it
i
know
i
will
overall
not
bad
it
got
some
nice
spiciness
and
flavors
well
worth
a
try
o
really
enjoyed
it
and
paired
well
with
some
seafood
id
get
it
again
overall
4
5
overall
a
fantastic
beer
it
hits
so
many
unusual
points
in
the
standard
belgian
palate
of
tastes
that
i
would
unconditionally
recommend
it
to
any
and
all
fans
of
brews
from
the
land
of
awesome
beers
moules
frites
and
that
weird
statue
in
brussels
if
you
can
find
this
beer
buy
it
this
saison
needs
refinement
the
head
and
the
light
tea
color
are
fine
but
the
finish
needs
to
rounded
out
and
the
mouthfeel
slightly
less
forceful
a
good
saison
has
a
mellow
fruitiness
with
tart
overtones
o
an
interesting
twist
on
a
great
style
i
really
like
their
interpretation
of
this
one
the
mouthfeel
stands
out
to
me
as
a
positive
i
like
the
oat
additions

a
clear
yellow
with
an
offwhite

that
settles
to
a

down
smell
is

taste
is
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
that
is
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
easy
drinking
saison
that
is
nicely
flavored
and
has
enough
spiciness
to
keep
it
interesting
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
perfect
brew
as
the
weather
warms
heading
into
summer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
large
white
head
that
goes
down

slowly

very
spicy

a
hint
of
funky
brett

some

belgian

is
initially
spicy

and
just
a
bit

some
nice

finish
slightly

and
dry

very
high
overall
i
really
like
this
saison
i
also
really
like
red

i
would
like
to
do
a
side

with
the

translucent
golden

very
impressive
3

looks
impressive
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of

earthen

grassy
almost
though
fresh
like
a
field
of
wheat
rather
than
a
lawnmower
if
that
makes
sense
its
nice
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
nice
foundation
or
toasted
malts
from
which
the
peppery
citrus
flavors
build
earthen
hops
with
mild
bitterness
crisp
and
clean
moderate
carbonation
and
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
overall
another
fantastic
lost
abbey
brew
very
enjoyable
body
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
with
really
nice
mediumhigh
natural
carbonation
real
lively
great
feel
a
solid
saison
from
the
lost
abbey
o
typical
saison
i
like
the
majority
of
the
lost
abbeys
brews
and
this
is
one
of
them
give
it
a
shot
d
its
a
pretty
decent
american
saison
but
the
brett
didnt
seems
to
take
off
the
way
it
did
in
saints
red
barn
or
saints
devotion
or
even
brouwers
imagination
2008
perhaps
ill
revisit
this
fresh
to
see
if
i
like
it
more
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
not
overly
complex
but
very
solid
overall
very
drinkable
a
very
tasty
saison
good
balance
between
spice
and
citrus
pours
a
slightlyhazy
peach
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
white
head
loads
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
and
a
thick
collar
throughout
the
nose
carries
some
light
fruit
plus
a
bit
of
white
pepper
and
spice
light
coriander
character
and
a
bit
of
citrus
peel
light
wheat
slight
dryness
to
the
finish
mediumhigh
carbonation
good
malt
backbone
with
a
nice
bit
of
spice
and
yeast
bite
throughout
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
the
brett
is
very
melow
and
the
bitterness
is
a
little
high
over
all
a
finely
crafted
ale
id
definitely
buy
this
again
o
im
giving
this
beer
an
average
rating
im
picking
up
a
lot
of
lemony
citrus
flavors
that
arent
really
to
my
taste
and
there
is
a
taste
maybe
from
a
combination
of
flavors
that
reminds
me
of
a
metallic
taste
not
sure
how
else
to
describe
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
saison
that
has
been
hopped
up
with
some
american
flare
a
bit
simple
perhaps
with
not
as
much
complexity
in
the
fruity
profile
as
many
other
saisons
but
very
refreshing
and
tasty
in
its
own
regard
a
delicious
and
classic
version
of
a
great
style
poured
into
a
wine
glass
with
great
half
inch
head
dark
golden
color
and
white
head
but
it
faded
quickly
and
there
is
a
slight
chill
haze
to
add
color
not
overly
carbonated
and
the
smell
is
traditional
saison
good
spice
notes
of
coriander
and
orange
with
a
slight
back
end
herb
flavor
over
all
good
beer
but
the
finish
left
a
bit
of
an
oily
mouthfeel
another
pretty
good
beer
from
lost
abbey
need
to
make
it
back
to
the
brewery
for
some
ten
commandments
overall
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
having
been
obviously
brewed
lovingly
and
with
a
good
amount
of
ingredients
im
not
sure
it
necessarily
brings
anything
new
to
the
table
but
it
is
quite
delicious
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
light
orange
hue
and
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
dense
belgianlike
frosty
head
that
reduced
fairly
quickly
but
left
sheets
of
lacings
on
the
glass
wheat
biscuit
banana
aromas
with
a
bit
of
funky
fruity
belgian
yeast
that
is
difficult
to
describe
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
light
oily
feel
that
surpresses
the
carbonaton
a
bit
wheat
biscuit
malt
and
banana
flavors
up
front
that
taper
as
hoppy
lemon
bitterness
is
introduced
hops
and
underlying
banana
flavor
carry
through
and
lead
to
a
tangy
not
quite
spicy
feel
toward
the
finish
finishes
with
a
clean
feel
accompanied
by
a
lingering
hop
bittterness
lots
of
different
aromas
and
flavors
with
this
ale
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bross242
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
did
not
pick
up
on
any
of
the
spices
usually
associated
with
this
style
unfortunately
but
it
allowed
the
rest
of
the
flavors
to
step
forward
and
take
the
show
this
was
a
pretty
nice
and
easy
drinking
brew
and
was
a
nice
palate
cleanser
during
the
night
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
i
dont
want
to
say
that
all
american
brewers
are
crafting
belgian
ales
that
meet
or
often
exceed
the
quality
and
complexity
of
their
creators
but
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
tomme
arthur
puts
out
enough
of
them
for
the
whole
country
carnevale
is
another
one
in
a
long
line
of
lost
abbey
beers
that
remarkably
captures
the
charm
and
character
of
a
belgian
classic
overall
this
is
an
exception
example
of
the
saison
style
which
seems
to
be
becoming
easier
to
find
as
more
breweries
are
taking
a
crack
at
it
its
delicious
highly
drinkable
and
not
overwhelming
at
a
modest
6
5
i
highly
recommend
it
if
you
dig
this
style
m
semi
tart
and
crisp
with
great
sweet
to
citrus
medium
and
refreshing
d
a
very
good
saison
i
would
have
guessed
a
higher
abv
than
the
6
5
it
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
and
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
taste
small
tartness
earthy
fresh
hops
and
a
nice
dry
yeast
presence
in
the
end
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fresh
hop
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
hop
presence
in
a
fine
saison
o
a
spicy
citrus
saison
yet
down
to
earth
the
way
it
should
be
perfect
for
a
summer
night
like
tonight
overall
i
think
my
expectations
were
mostly
on
target
just
as
much
a
golden
as
a
blonde
or
saison
just
imagine
more
concentrated
and
heavily
hopped
as
with
most
of
similar
styles
this
would
make
a
fine
versatile
table
beer
o
a
saison
on
the
citrus
end
of
the
style
on
whole
id
say
the
quality
is
on
par
with
red
barn
delicious
o
solid
saison
from
the
lost
abbey
it
is
not
particularly
earth
shattering
but
delivers
what
one
would
expect
for
the
style
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
in
my
opinion
nothing
more
o
solid
example
of
a
saison
especially
for
those
hot
latespringearly
summer
days
pours
out
as
a
typical
looking
saison
brew
the
beer
is
yellow
and
kind
of
cloudy
looking
the
smell
is
a
little
earthy
but
not
too
much
had
some
nice
fresh
hops
aromas
in
there
as
well
the
taste
didnt
give
off
much
of
a
farmhouse
taste
but
it
did
have
a
good
floral
quality
to
it
the
mouthfeel
overall
was
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
carbonation
was
pretty
good
despite
some
of
the
issues
lost
abbey
was
having
this
brew
is
worthy
of
trying
i
think
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
but
lacked
anything
to
really
set
it
apart
worth
a
shot
but
not
worth
seeking
strong
inviting
aroma
is
malty
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
grassy
hint
it
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
rather
persistent
white
head
mouth
filling
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
and
has
fruity
and
floral
undertones
as
well
as
an
herbal
hint
texture
is
fizzy
and
sassy
and
can
unexpectedly
bite
the
tongue
so
watch
out
another
winner
from
lost
abbey
this
saison
is
nice
in
that
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
it
lacks
depth
all
around
there
are
some
subtle
elements
but
not
enough
to
make
this
anything
special
even
the
lower
alcohol
percent
stands
out
because
of
this
it
just
needs
something
more
in
any
direction
this
beer
is
what
summer
saisons
are
all
about
you
need
to
pick
one
up
if
you
see
it
narrative
carrot
zucchini
god
is
that
all
there
is
vegetable
medley
every
wednesday
lasagna
on

she
lamented
idly
while
cutting
away
the
vegetables
and
her
wednesday
afternoon
the
granite
counters
were
not
pedestrian
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
routine
provided
stability
yet
why
hello
her
eyes
strayed
as
a
festive
guatemalan
man
began
skimming
her
pool
i
dont
recall
seeing
him
before
she
watched
him
pep
within
his
step
remove
dead
frogs
from
the
skimmer
basket
an
artful
spin
while
he
skimmed
the
weeping
willow
leaves
from
the
surface
of
the

such
grace
finding
majesty
in
the
menial
her
eyes
glazed
over
as
she
startled
herself
upon
cutting
to
the
end
of
an
overly
ripe
zucchini
how
could
he
add
such
panache
to
seemingly
uninteresting
tasks
the
spring
heat
seemed
to
lean
oppresively
upon
the
task
of
the
ceiling
fan
clicking
under
the
stress
of
its
laborious
gyrations
he
finds
such
pleasure
in
the

menial

some
a

he
removes
the
dead
leaves
of

aplomb
casting

into

the

is
upon
us
the
cpj
good
looking

here
with
a
nice
straw

and

white

good
retention
too
though
maybe
not
as
good
of
head
as
you
might
see
on

all
the
right
notes
for
the
saison
lemon

bready

apples
maybe
a
hint
of
funk
flavor
was
spot
on
toojust
a
straightforward
refreshing
saison
i
dont
think
i
could
spend
all
day
searching
for
nuances
in
this
beer
but
it
was
clean
crisp
and
just
plain
good
feel
was
light
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
saisondoesnt
change
the
brewing
world
but
it
is
wellexecuted
and
worth
the
try
ill
definitely
order
it
again
if
i
see
it
jd
d
really
easy
drinking
for
a
nice
hot
day
saisons
are
porch
beers
sip
and
enjoy
the
day
pass
by
o
it
was
65
degrees
out
and
we
were
putting
together
our
new
bbq
and
this
really
hit
the
spot
an
exceptional
example
of
the
style
a
nice
beery
saison
and
quite
drinkable
a
little
harsh
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
worth
a
try
personally
i
like
a
little
more
mellowness
to
go
with
the
tart
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
with
each
sip
leading
easily
to
the
next
ill
be
happy
to
see
this
beer
again
and
im
already
trying
to
figure
out
where
to
get
a
case
my
overall
impression
is
of
a
wellmade
saisonlike
beer
that
is
an
imaginative
combination
of
a
belgian
style
made
with
some
uniquely
american
ingredients
the
hops
that
just
works
medium
body
higher
carbonation
slightly
creamy
and
smooth
super
drinkable
refreshing
and
pleasant
from
top
to
bottom
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
has
just
enough
funkiness
a
nice
a
pickup
medium
body
with
a
crisp
spicy
presence
up
front
with
sme
slight
earthy
tarntness
and
sweet
light
fruit
slightly
creamy
mid
palate
with
faint
bitterness
balanced
out
by
the
sweeter
light
fruit
notes
hints
of
apple
pear
and
grape
as
well
as
a
pale
malt
character
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
well
masked
abv
refreshing
with
a
slight
dry
finish
poured
into
a
tulip
from
a
24oz
it
pours
a
nice
hazy
peach
with
a
dismal
head
and
not
much
lace
not
bad
looking
but
certainly
not
a
beautiful
saison
the
smell
bumps
it
up
a
notch
for
sure
we
have
the
pale
bready
malts
some
pear
some
sour
stinky
funk
and
a
buttload
of
earthy
hops
its
just
a
little
light
it
took
me
a
bit
to
sniff
this
one
out
the
taste
follows
the
mouth
but
with
a
very
distict
french
bread
and
dried
pear
taste
super
easy
going
down
with
a
perfect
dry
finish
i
love
saisons
this
one
hit
the
mark
on
almost
all
notes
except
the
price
pretty
high
for
not
being
imported
this
was
my
second
brew
from
lost
abbey
the
first
being
a
2009
judgement
day
and
im
pretty
goddamned
impressed
so
far
props
to
my
brother
for
finding
this
bottle
intriguing
enough
to
give
it
a
try
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
minor
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
orange
zest
coriander
wheat
grass
and
black
pepper
the
taste
holds
notes
of
coriander
black
pepper
grass
light
lemon
zest
a
touch
of
tart
mandarin
oranges
and
a
hint
of
dry
blanket
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
nice
bit
o
saison
one
of
the
more
lowkey
and
drinkable
versions
ive
had
in
a
little
while
good
times
from
my
bro
drinkability
defendantly
a
lovely
beer
to
drink
would
have
been
great
if
i
aged
it
to
cool
off
on
a
hot
summer
night
d
decent
saison
but
i
have
had
better
this
is
my
1st
lost
abbey
and
a
tad
disappointed
i
will
definitely
try
a
few
more
different
styles
from
them
before
i
pass
judgement
on
the
brewery
could
down
a
few
of
these
with
ease
try
this
but
you
dont
need
to
seek
it
out
a
gentle
pop
of
the
cork
from
a
750
into
the
watou
chalice
it
went
a
bright
hay
color
with
a
slight
and
quickly
dissipating
head
that
was
not
too
surprising
given
the
lack
pressure
behind
the
cork
ah
how
often
do
i
get
a
lost
abbey
that
lacks
in
the
carbonation
department
a
quality
control
problem
i
suffer
because
when
it
turns
out
right
they
are
great
back
to
the
review
the
nose
is
of
a
sweet
malt
character
with
an
orange
citrus
i
suspect
the
lack
of
co2
allows
the
malt
character
to
dominate
the
nose
and
muddles
the
lemon
citrus
character
others
describe
into
a
sweeter
citrus
the
orange
im
detecting
in
the
background
is
the
funk
ah
the
funk
open
the
mouth
and
down
the
gullet
taking
time
to
dance
on
the
tongue
a
tang
hits
under
the
tongue
almost
a
carbonic
bite
but
not
dominating
is
bretts
funk
intermixed
with
hoppy
citrus
notes
and
a
slightly
harsh
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
obnoxiously
its
good
but
i
have
to
say
it
lacks
complexity
even
for
its
faults
it
is
an
easy
drinker
no
problem
finishing
the
750
and
feeling
better
for
it
d
the
brew
is
a
solid
saison
which
is
good
on
tap
as
well
and
drinks
fairly
good
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
poolside
d
this
was
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
the
abv
was
virtually
undetectable
but
ive
had
much
better
la
brews
still
it
was
worth
the
7
50
d
best
non375
ive
had
from
the
sinners
and
saints
reminded
me
of
a
hefeweizen
with
a
bunch
of
hibiscus
flowers
in
it
with
some
wet
dog
to
round
it
out
drinkability
easy
drinking
saison
not
much
else
to
say
gulpable
even
d
this
is
a
good
enjoyable
saison
it
tastes
good
and
its
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
getting
to
try
sometime
md
light
to
medium
body
carbonation
is
relatively
low
probably
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
and
little
less
body
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
solid
beer
caged
and
cork
much
like
all
of
the
lost
abbey
ales
this
is
a
saison
with
american
hops
pours
a
clouded
orange
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
fine
bubbled
no
pop
when
i
decorked
it
but
no
carbonation
issues
to
speak
of
aromatics
spicy
peppery
notes
herbal
citrus
qualities
as
well
a
touch
of
phenolic
plastic
hint
of
band
aid
more
so
tropical
fruits
like
mango
and
pineapple
standout
than
the
off
tones
especially
in
the
flavor
the
tropical
fruits
are
juicy
pineapple
and
ripened

to
have

i
hear
local
pittsburgh
shops
are
going
to
start
carrying
some
philly
brews
namingly
house
of
1000
beers
honey
drizzled
grains
with
a
nice
farmhouse
character
that
many
american
brewers
struggle
to
impart
in
their
saisons
hops
are
there
in
enough
quantity
to
put
a
west
coast
stamp
of
approval
on
it
although
tank
7
has
this
beat
by
a
wide
margin
in
the
lupulin
category
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
the
beers
best
quality
rich
and
creamy
with
perfect
carbonation
light
melon
fruitiness
comes
out
as
it
warms
i
am
still
not
sure
if
any
brettanomyces
are
present
the
nose
says
yes
and
the
taste
says
no
good
beer
nonetheless
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
could
be
categorized
as
a
belgianamerican
ipa
saison
now
thats
a
nice
hybrid
d
crisp
well
carbonated
and
refreshing
very
delicious
and
good
abv
very
drinkable
this
is
a
quality
saison
and
i
enjoy
the
slight
diversions
from
the
usual
style
it
is
not
quite
up
to
par
with
the
big
players
in
this
style
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
this
is
a
nice
saison
but
not
extremely
dintinctive
or
a
standout
brew
from
notes
taken
on
61710
ive
now
had
around
forty
saisons
and
while
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
it
doesnt
stack
up
that
well
against
its
competitors
it
seems
to
oscillate
between
subtle
balance
and
blandness
without
really
achieving
the
complexity
or
finesse
of
other
beers
drinkability
relatively
so
though
there
are
so
many
other
saisons
out
there
id
rather
have
my
first
beer
from
lost
abbey
will
not
be
my
last
d
a
different
saison
interpretation
i
would
probably
try
something
different
next
time
might
be
worth
a
try

overall
a

take
on
a
saison
from
lost

im
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
and
wish
i
had
bought
a
case
poured
into
tulip
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
tall
fluffy
white
head
that
had
very
good
retention
and
ok
lacing
the
aroma
was
the
expected
spice
and
yeast
the
taste
was
very
similar
grain
spice
and
yeast
the
body
was
light
and
crisp
drinkability
was
good
but
the
beer
was
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
d
very
drinkable
and
so
easy
to
do
so
favlorful
but
never
overwhelming
great
saison
to
kick
back
with
d
certainly
a
nontraditional
interpretation
but
worth
a
try
very
fresh
invigorating
pretty
good
enjoyed
this
one
with
a
year
on
it
much
more
than
i
did
fresh
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
and
is
the
only
real
part
of
the
beer
that
was
subpar
to
rest
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
saison
smells
like
a
rodennbach
tastes
like
an
oerbier
mixed
with
an
ipa
not
my
favorite
saison
or
whatever
but
good
at
6
5
this
is
an
easy
drinker
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
ill
try
again
d
thought
this
was
a
decent
saison
i
thought
the
smell
was
better
than
the
taste
and
enjoyed
the
funk
it
had
would
try
again
this
is
the
2009
vintage
which
was
brewed
using
brettanomyces
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
brett
with
some
citrus
i
also
get
some
tartness
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
citrus
spices
belgian
yeast
and
some
brett
characteristics
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
light
golden

some
visible
carbonation

floral

taste
is

orange
peel
some
pepper
not
too
much
in
hops
subsumed
by
fruitiness
though
i
do
note
some
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
high
attenuated
finish
pretty
sweet
but
not
too
cloying
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
prefer
red
barn
to
this
sweeter
saison
and
the
hops
were
very
muted
defeating
the
purpose
of
the
dryhopping
actually
i
prefer
upright
seven
to
both
but
thats
another
story
for
a
sunny
beervana
day
medium
body
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
liven
this
up
a
bit
alcohol
well
hidden
not
bad
an
ok
beer
that
honestly
isnt
as
good
as
hennepin
i
find
myself
thinking
ok
i
drank
it
give
me
a
duvel
or
hennepin
now
d
lost
abbey
does
it
again
another
really
really
good
brew
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
and
probably
wont
order
it
again
a
great
beer
to
start
to
session
of
with
all
the
flavors
are
so
subtle
gets
the
palat
primed
for
something
a
bit
heavier
bottom
line
get
it
on
tap
if
you
see
it
flavor
is
solid
for
its
style
has
the
typical
light
fruit
grassearth
tones
a
little
funk
a
small
amount
of
spices
booze
isnt
even
detectable
crisp
and
light
mouthfeel
light
body
high
carbonation
which
is
nice
to
see
from
lost
abbey
with
that
said
their
still
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
carnevale
is
an
easy
drinker
i
am
easily
going
to
finish
this
whole
750ml
myself
a
very
nice
beer
overall
i
had
no
problem
taking
down
the
whole
750
and
enjoyed
every
sip
drinkabilitya
nice
and
dry
flavorful
saison
that
is
good
not
great
for
the
style
i
do
like
the
flavor
combinations
i
would
get
this
again
but
there
are
other
lost
abbey
beers
i
would
get
sooner
pours
a
mirky
cloudy
orangishyellow
haze
with
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
yeasty
nose
with
spicy
notes
like
clove
and
allspice
some
citrus
oil
scents
also
seem
very
inviting
biscuit
bite
is
up
front
with
a
dry
and
slightly
tart
finish
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
some
brett
funk
in
there
too
refreshing
and
pleasant
lacing
clings
well
wishing
there
was
more
funk
overall
a
good
one
d
an
easy
drinking
saison
for
sure
but
also
a
very
unique
one
different
from
most
ive
had
after
trying
this
one
the
other
night
the
brett
is
really
doing
wonderful
things
this
one
already
good
is
getting
better
vintage
2009
yum
this
beer
turns
my
gears
for
sure
burnt
gold
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
nice
white
head
that
shrinks
but
never
disappears
and
leaves
splotchy
lace
as
the
beer
is
drained
not
really
sure
how
it
could
look
much
better
but
im
not
in
to
5s
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
although
it
seems
to
all
be
harmonizing
nicely
the
first
things
that
come
to
mind
are
lemon
grape
apple
and
pastry
almost
like
a
really
good
proper
apple
pie
that
is
laced
with
lemon
some
pear
and
horse
blanket
as
well
as
musty
cellar
and
grass
just
like
the
nose
suggests
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
all
the
tastes
are
defined
yet
blended
very
well
and
the
acid
levels
are
just
right
to
produce
a
lingering
finish
that
is
extremely
pleasant
really
good
job
balancing
bitter
and
sour
hops
come
out
in
the
middle
and
then
gently
dance
with
the
sour
funk
in
the
end
earthy
stuff
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
up
soft
medium
body
on
the
light
side
of
medium
impressive
tomme
arthur
deserves
every
bit
of
hype
he
gets
i
need
more
bright
yet
murky
with
an
intense
earthiness
in
the
nose
you
get
a
little
of
that
pungent
hay
barn
smell
that
some
saisons
present
taste
is
pleasant
and
not
overwhelming
i
like
that
this
beer
laces
nicely
and
a
little
more
than
other
saisons
i
think
the
drinkability
of
this
particular
beer
is
where
it
wins
in
my
book
very
nice
no
real
bite
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
great
on
a
warm
day
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
good
tasting
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
very
good
all
around
beer
d
the
brett
doesnt
really
hit
the
palate
until
the
finish
and
leaves
a
prominant
lingering
flavor
that
balances
against
some
nice
hop
bitterness
pretty
interesting
slightly
againststyle
effort
that
works
pretty
well
likely
a
oneanddone
this
is
an
extremely
easy
to
drink
saison
that
was
much
better
and
more
interesting
than
i
anticipated
d
a
solid
saison
made
even
more
dynamic
with
a
more
pronounced
hop
addition
than
what
is
usually
found
in
the
style
not
as
funky
as
what
you
would
typically
consider
in
this
style
but
why
follow
what
others
do
i
am
enjoying
this
one
thoroughly
really
enjoyed
this
i
guess
i
dont
have
enough
experience
to
say
this
was
a
classic
saison
but
it
meets
the
criteria
of
being
fairly
dry
refreshing
and
somewhat
rustic
nice
all
around
the
feel
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
feel
to
this
beer
and
is
slightly
acidy
but
very
pleasing
the
first
lost
abbey
beer
i
have
had
and
i
am
very
happy
with
this
experience
this
is
a
great
saison
lots
of
subtle
complexities
there
are
a
ton
of
hops
but
they
are
never
overpowered
by
the
funky
yeast
and
sweet
fruity
esters
highly
recommended
very
good
beer
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
certainly
the
best
ive
had
for
the
first
time
in
quite
a
while
this
one
has
been
hiding
in
the
back
of
psycohops
fridge
for
more
than
six
months
thanks
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
bob
a
corked
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
9
2009
vintage
on
the
label
uncorked
and
poured
into
a
pair
of
shaker
glasses
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
apricot
color
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
creamy
light
rust
colored
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
musty
funky
brettlike
notes
albeit
somewhat
mild
good
in
this
case
lemon
apples
pear
spicy
yeast
citrusy
at
least
a
notch
better
than
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
ample
carbonation
as
well
very
nice
thanks
again
bob
the
beer
labels
itself
as
a
hoppy
saison
though
the
hops
do
not
overpower
the
naturally
delicious
flavors
of
the
saison
no
drowning
out
of
flavor
with
too
much
citrus
or
mustiness
the
belgian
flavors
are
first
and
foremost
on
the
palate
the
funk
of
the
beer
is
pronounced
and
enjoyable
a
sweet
and
acidic
brew
less
dry
than
saison
dupont
and
without
the
skunk
some
sds
suffer
from
the
beer
is
almost
a
clone
of
fantomes
original
saison
in
terms
of
flavor
and
funk
i
will
be
buying
more
of
these
very
soon
the
only
downside
was
that
the
beer
was
slightly
undercarbonated
but
this
didnt
affect
its
drinkability
pretty
damn
good
saison
but
it
was
a
tad
sweet
poured
with
a
nice
white
head
and
good
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
gold
aroma
is
spicey
grassy
light
malt
yeast
bread
and
bit
of
sour
fruit
flavors
the
same
and
big
on
the
saison
flavors
but
a
little
over
sweet
body
is
decent
and
so
is
the
carbonation
little
strong
alcohol
in
the
finsih
maybe
a
session
carnevale
is
a
very
solid
release
from
lost
abbey
its
not
in
the
upper
echelon
of
their
release
but
it
is
quite
good
personally
id
like
a
more
pronounced
belgian
yeast
flavor
that
would
easily
ratchet
up
the
score
for
me
but
that
really
is
nitpicking
carnevales
a
really
good
saison
thats
well
worth
checking
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonated
and
silky
smooth
excites
the
palate
overall
a
refreshingly
crisp
brew
this
is
a
style
of
beer
i
usually
enjoy
and
this
one
is
average
to
slightly
above
average
when
compared
against
its
peers
nothing
outstanding
but
its
worth
a
try
d
easy
to
finish
and
sessionable
this
beer
very
much
reminds
me
of
summer
and
is
certainly
something
i
will
be
checking
out
next
year
another
lost
abbey
product
with
no
qc
issues
check
this
one
out
75cl
bottle
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
and
light
lace
the
nose
is
a
nice
fruity
mix
of
hops
and
funky
yeast
with
s
dusty
almost
sour
tinge
the
flavor
is
hoppy
with
some
lemony
bitterness
a
hint
of
acidity
and
yeast
fruitiness
a
little
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
still
finishing
pretty
dry
light
on
the
tongue
with
medium
carbonation
that
seemed
like
it
needed
to
be
a
little
higher
to
give
an
optimum
feel
there
was
a
promise
of
a
funkier
more
acidic
beer
but
it
turned
out
a
little
more
straight
forward
and
simple
very
drinkable
stuff
the
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
and
bitterness
to
the
malt
that
is
just
a
little
sweet
d
its
not
hard
to
drink
i
just
dont
like
it
and
wont
drink
more
da
rock
solid
saison
with
plenty
of
spicy
zip
and
a
nice
touch
of
lemony
zing
easy
to
drink
and
flavourful
a
well
done
take
on
one
of
my
most
favorite
styles
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
nothing
groundbreaking
but
well
worth
a
try
d
very
manageable
abv
and
drinks
easy
enough
very
tasty
and
unique
drinkability
not
my
style
but
i
can
appreciate
the
quality
of
this
beer
and
it
does
seem
to
be
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
true
to
style
brew
albeit
not
overly
notable
good
flavor
with
glaring
weaknesses
elsewhere
the
750
will
satisfy
my
thirst
for
this
one
and
i
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
the
taste
is
interesting
and
but
plain
the
mostly
tastes
hoppy
light
notes
of
citrus
its
very
drinkable
smooth
taste
through
out
but
nothing
overly
special
2012
edition
much
better
owing
to
fresh
lemony
taste
and
hops
n
finish
this
rating
is
the
2012
drinkability
is
good
very
refreshing
and
light
on
the
palate
just
what
a
good
saison
should
be
excellent
cheers
d
was
sitting
outside
at
the
belgian
cafe
on
a
humid
summer
night
and
this
beer
served
cold
was
perfectly
refreshing
and
light
without
sacrificing
flavor
and
complexity
drinkability
for
me
is
very
good
but
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
deserves
a
critical
pallet
if
you
love
saisons
seek
this
party
out
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
silky
beige
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
nose
has
a
collection
of
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
bready
malts
zesty
spices
herbal
hops
and
musky
barnyard
funk
taste
not
quite
as
impressive
but
well
balanced
fruity
malts
earthy
hops
peppery
spices
and
a
subtle
wild
yeast
presence
crisp
body
is
well
carbonated
tasty
stuff
indeed
drinkability
good
1xboa
say
say
say
what
you
want
but
sir
paul
mccartney
himself
would
argue
its
human
nature
to
like
this
beer
carnevale
is
not
my
lover
its
just
a
beer
but
its
a
pretty
good
one
rip
mj
pours
a
semihazey
dull
golden
hay
color
maybe
some
faint
amber
hues
mixed
in
there
as
well
the
aroma
is
sweet
toasted
malts
light
apple
juice
and
some
unindetifiable
herbs
starts
off
sweet
from
the
malts
and
fruity
from
the
yeast
the
middle
is
more
grainy
and
herbal
with
the
effervescant
bubbles
throughout
the
entire
palate
i
love
the
carbonation
but
the
mix
of
favors
dont
segue
well
from
one
o
the
other
not
bad
though
d
quite
delicious
delicate
and
relatively
complex
more
like
a
belgian
golden
ale
than
a
saison
or
farmhouse
because
it
lacks
the
musty
and
funky
yeast
flavors
instead
flavor
relies
on
the
balanced
and
smooth
malt
flavors
excellent
saison
one
ill
be
happy
to
procure
again
and
one
that
ensures
i
will
seek
out
more
from
the
storied
lost
abbey
very
well
done
im
certainly
impressed
before
my
trip
to
the
west
coast
i
would
say
that
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
uber
hops
but
i
am
a
changed
man
i
cant
wait
to
go
back
super
drinkable
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
light
ale
with
the
strength
of
an
average
ipa
super
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
was
excited
to
see
something
from
lost
abbey
that
i
havent
had
probably
my
favorate
brewery
looks
almost
like
an
ipa
and
the
head
doesnt
really
stick
around
that
long
or
leave
any
lacing
smell
is
different
almost
like
there
is
some
brett
in
there
very
funky
taste
is
weird
also
this
is
a
freakshow
of
a
beer
not
really
sure
what
to
think
the
american
hops
dont
stound
out
too
much
some
sweetness
some
funk
and
thats
about
it
decent
but
not
quite
one
i
would
buy
again
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
seems
like
it
isnt
any
one
style
which
almost
detracts
from
the
taste
an
interesting
concept
but
is
a
little
too
weird
for
me
i
love
saisons
but
this
was
too
different
d
easy
to
put
away
the
brettiness
might
start
to
get
old
after
a
while
though
d
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
with
the
nice
balance
pours
a
medium
golden
hue
some
haze
and
bright
white
head
nose
comes
across
as
sour
fruit
mix
and
peach
juice
on
the
palate
this
is
a
whopper
of
a
sour
ale
with
pear
flavors
some
malt
sweetness
a
pleasant
sourness
and
some
candy
sugar
sweetness
at
the
end
on
the
finish
this
is
an
interesting
very
tasty
saison
the
aroma
pops
a
bit
more
than
the
taste
which
is
more
subtle
and
dominated
more
by
the
spicing
and
hops
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
it
doesnt
rate
with
my
favorite
saisons
or
my
favorite
la
beers
but
its
one
i
would
certainly
come
back
to
i
thought
this
was
a
good
domestic
saison
nothing
more
the
addition
of
american
hops
was
a
good
idea
although
i
dont
believe
it
did
a
whole
lot
in
this
instance
the
main
issue
here
was
the
carbonation
which
admittedly
could
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
i
had
the
beer
shipped
all
the
way
across
the
country
although
i
doubt
it
because
ive
had
other
beers
shipped
from
the
same
place
that
were
fine
carbonationwise
still
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
a
good
beer
its
probably
not
worth
ordering
online
and
paying
for
shipping
but
if
its
available
in
your
area
give
it
a
try
recommended
d
seems
very
similar
to
their
other
saison
red
barn
its
not
bad
at
all
but
i
think
id
go
with
something
else
in
terms
of
value
bone
white
head
of
mixed
large
bubbles
to
pure
froth
moderate
lacing
settles
quickly
into
a
half
finger
coating
cloudy
yellow
color
with
some
orange
for
hue
depth
healthy
glow
to
it
and
completely
opaque
slowly
works
its
way
up
to
being
very
full
in
the
nose
unhurried
unfurling
of
uncooked
bread
dough
orange
and
lemon
rinds
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
spice
underlying
earthiness
anchors
it
the
white
fruit
palpable
but
doesnt
diverge
into
distinct
parts
ends
with
suggestions
of
both
white
pepper
and
field
wildflowers
fullbodied
moves
like
its
still
slightly
buzzed
from
the
night
before
and
thrown
off
by
the
light
when
the
shades
are
pulled
back
at
1100
am
hence
the
flavors
have
the
same
gauziness
as
the
liquid
itself
the
slabs
of
lemon
and
orange
the
just
out
of
the
oven
sourdough
bread
the
mixed
baking
spices
and
flowers
need
mastication
to
get
working
carbonation
active
for
what
it
has
to
cut
through
nectarine
pineapple
peach
pear
fruit
a
background
element
overall
round
texture
but
definitely
firms
up
the
focus
through
the
finish
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
like
their
red
barn
i
think
ther
750
ml
is
best
split
due
to
its
filling
nature
drinkability
is
like
any
great
saison
fantastic
md
light
and
crisp
very
well
carbonated
easy
drinking
an
excellent
saison
but
nothing
exceptional
drinkability
i
kind
of
feel
like
ive
had
this
beer
before
it
has
that
same
sort
of
yeasty
tone
that
ive
had
in
a
lot
of
lost
abbeys
beers
now
im
definitely
not
saying
that
is
a
bad
thing
its
just
that
this
didnt
feel
new
ya
know
anywho
nancy
negative
aside
its
a
damned
tasty
brew
that
i
really
enjoyed
thanks
matt
overall
good
not
my
thing
but
good
poured
at
cellar
temp
producing
a
decent
head
over
clouded
light
gold
color
good
amount
of
lacing
that
lasted
quite
a
while
thoughout
the
session
nose
was
light
floral
with
some
sourness
though
taste
had
nothing
but
floral
sweet
belgian
yeast
scents
not
as
complex
as
was
hoped
after
smell
though
quite
a
good
beer
and
though
not
really
a
session
beer
as
stated
above
at
6
5
abv
its
not
overthetop
in
alcohol
and
the
taste
is
light
enough
that
it
is
quite
drinkable
if
this
were
ontap
id
say
i
would
be
happy
to
order
a
few
of
these
during
an
evening
mouthfeel
is
good
and
certainly
a
solid
representation
of
belgianfarmhouse
ale
conclusion
this
is
a
nice
saison
which
definitely
pushes
the
earthyfunky
notes
more
than
the
fruit
first
time
trying
this
i
love
the
nose
but
spicy
finish
is
almost
a
bit
too
much
for
me
and
kills
the
session
potential
of
this
beer
because
id
seek
out
something
with
a
tad
less
spark
on
the
tail
end
of
the
sip
its
not
bad
though
and
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
were
offered
to
me
lost
abbey
never
fails
if
you
get
your
hands
on
this
drink
this
cold
on
a
hot
day
be
greedy
dont
share
d
this
one
is
very
drinkable
will
drink
again
this
is
a
good
sipper
for
a
warm
evening
overall
a
solid
saison
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
worthwhile
pickup

large
foamy

with
great
retention
and
perfect
lacing
aroma
of
european
dry
hops
with
light
notes
of
brett
aroma
of
dominated
by
european
hops
saaz
with
some
light
bretty
notes
and
some
distinctive
belgian
malt
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
dry
hoppy
notes
with
a
nice
belgian
malt
backbone
i
didnt
notice
as
much
ester
as
i
would
have
expected
but
i
still
quite
enjoyed
this
one
full
body
with
great
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
note
whatsoever
pours
a
foggy
gold
with
a
quite
thin
white
head
nose
is
inky
dough
and
some
funk
flavor
is
citrus
themed
with
quite
a
bit
of
dough
and
spices
to
match
quite
earthy
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thin
on
liquid
and
carbonation
is
low
seems
appropriate
on
all
sides
this
is
a
nice
saison
earthy
and
inky
its
bringing
the
right
levels
of
funk
and
flavor
drinkability
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
experienced
i
guess
this
probably
has
to
do
with
me
not
being
a
huge
session
beer
guy
but
it
just
was
a
great
drinking
experience
its
infinitely
quaffable
you
could
have
ten
of
them
and
it
would
just
fly
by
d
for
me
this
beer
would
get
tiring
pretty
quick
another
one
down
in
my
quest
to
drink
all
lost
abbeys
jason
is
a
proper
trader
we
should
do
it
again
yet
i
doubt
i
have
the
ammo
perfectly
carbonated
for
the
lightmedium
body
an
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
that
tastes
like
a
little
piece
of
belgium
nicely
done
enjoy
great
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
having
just
consumed
a
red
barn
this
kissing
cousin
has
a
tough
precedent
to
live
up
to
i
think
i
prefer
the
layered
complexity
of
the
red
barn
but
this
is
well
suited
to
a
warmer
summer
occasion
too
bad
we
are
in
december
right
now
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
short
white
head
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
german
hefe
banana
clove
apricots
and
lemon
clean
light
taste
that
is
a
cross
between
a
hefe
and
a
trippel
more
yeast
and
clove
but
now
with
bubblegum
and
spice
with
a
little
sugary
wheat
flavor
i
really
liked
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spritzy
of
co2
with
dry
peppery
notes

the
finish

is
very
similar

red

with
a

to
it
decent
beer
but
after
having
ne
goien
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
drinkability
better
than

would
have
liked
some
funk

maybe
a
bit
more
of
a
lemon
flavor

well
still

d
i
would
like
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
myself
or
perhaps
share
with
one
person
nice
experience
and
a
great
beer
my
1st
lost
abbey
beer
and
i
really
like
it
fairly
clear

with
a
dense
layer
of
white
foam
good
head
retention
and
thick
chunky
lacing
crackery
fruity
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
grassy
and
herbal
hop
notes
a
bit
yeasty
and
spicy
bitterness
was
restrained
but
was
a
bit
more
forceful
in
the
finish
where
the
hop
flavour
lingered
up
front
it
had
a
fruity
wheat
cracker
flavour
with
spicy
and
earthy
characters
throughout
strawberry
with
a
bit
of
tartness
good
stuff
refreshing
medium
to
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
quite
smooth
in
texture
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
little
saison
pretty
reasonable
price
from
what
i
recall
although
i
had
to
drive
across
the
river
into
wa
to
get
it
better
then
my
first
time
drinking
it
which
was
granted
a
bottle
split
3
ways
it
goes
to
show
you
should
always
try
something
a
second
time
d
a
nice
saison
but
not
the
best
and
even
not
the
best
from
la
red

ale
their
year

saison
is
comparable
if
not
slightly
better
nice
take
on
a
saison

the
additional

profile
to

beer

hoppy
for
a
saison
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
grassy
hops

well

mouthfeel
isnt
overcarbonated
in
fact
its
very
smooth
the
smell
initially
makes
you
go
woh
its
very
sweaty
musty
however
the
taste
isnt
anything
like
that
just
slightly
earthy
very
light
and
a
bit
fruity
finishing
dry
so
easy
to
drink
just
what
was
needed
on
a
hot
night
in
southern
california
like
tonight
i
even
preferred
this
to
the
saison
dupont
i
had
right
after
a
very
intense
saison
i
would
like
to
pair
this
up
with
some
apricot
goat
cheese
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
style
not
a
big
saison
fan
but
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
because
it
is
from
lost
abbey
tried
to
go
to
this
release
party
had
to
get
some
work
done
instead
unfortunately
not
a
bad
brew
but
average
among
this
brewerys
other
beers
might
drink
again
next
year
when
it
is
released
worth
trying
this
beer
all
sort
of
qualities
from
tripel
to
wit
to
saison
but
stays
firmly
in
the
latter
for
the
most
part
it
has
a
range
of
flavors
but
they
remain
subdued
letting
its
saison
colors
shine
through
highly
drinkable
the
bottle
goes
awfully
quick
d
reasonably
drinkable
and
very
reminiscent
of
a
witbier
not
too
complex
but
enjoyable
overall
with
an
excellent
mouthfeel
served
in
my
delirium
tremens
tulip
poured
a
translucent
orangegold
with
lots
of
effervescence
present
during
the
tasting
threequarter
inch
offwhite
head
quickly
dissipated
into
a
skim
of
foam
and
ringlets
some
watery
sheets
of
lacing
but
poor
retention
scents
of
lemon
zest
yeast
funk
was
very
much
in
the
background
and
hard
to
detect
and
some
spiciness
flavors
similar
to
nose
with
a
bit
of
a
grassy
presence
and
the
addition
of
clove
hops
for
bite
and
green
apple
lively
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
a
burn
across
the
tongue
and
palette
followed
by
a
clean
tart
finish
good
drinkability
that
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
solid
offering
from
lost
abbey
pours
a
darker
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
actively
bubbling
foam
smell
has
some
funk
to
it
a
bit
of
sweetness
some
belgian
yeast
and
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
taste
follows
suit
with
some
sweet
malt
a
nice
belgian
yeast
flavor
mild
hops
and
a
nice
bit
of
funk
to
it
its
almost
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
saison
i
would
think
its
pretty
good
overall
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
saison
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
stretch
but
lost
abbey
has
done
something
good
here
carnevale
ale
has
some
serious
competition
since
belgian
tripels
bspas
and
saisons
are
some
of
the
finest
beers
in
all
the
world
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
quite
enter
that
rarefied
air
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
its
still
delicious
immensely
drinkable
beer
that
continues
the
seemingly
unending
parade
of
excellence
coming
out
of
san
marcos
d
my
feeling
about
this
is
about
the
same
as
with
their
yearround
brew
devotion
its
not
bad
but
at
the
rate
that
im
going
to
drink
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
i
would
probably
look
elsewhere
typical

final
memory
of
this
offering
pleasant
and
worthy
creation
from

bring
on
the
spicy
foodbbq
and
enjoy
this
one
this
is
a
nice
pickmeup
after
a
hot
summer
day
style
brew
the
lable
is
a
keeper
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
creamy
very
refreshing
with
just
the
right
punch
of
carbonation
this
would
be
a
great
brew
on
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
tasty
take
on
a
saison
from
the
lost
abbey
crew
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
and
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
medium
golden
orange
with
a
light
white
head
semi
hazy
look
from
the
first
pour
of
the
bottle
smell
is
floral
and
honey
like
with
a
delicateness
about
it
some
lemon
perhaps
as
well
taste
is
lightly
bretty
perhaps
somewhat
of
a
drying
dusty
floral
taste
with
light
malt
presence
and
a
touch
of
hops
coming
through
as
well
didnt
get
smacked
in
the
face
with
spices
but
perhaps
a
light
amount
were
there
really
easy
drinking
and
nice
just
a
tad
mild
flavored
but
perhaps
that
is
why
i
was
so
pleasantly
surprised
carnevale
ale
is
a
wellcrafted
excellent
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
offering
from
lost
abbey
but
well
worth
drinking
taste
is
earthy
and
spirited
with
a
great
hop
blend
mixed
with
fresh
baked
bread
and
a
wonderful
spiciness
hops
come
again
in
the
dry
spritzy
finish
damn
this
shit
is
refreshing
a
mild
barnyard
funk
in
the
background
no
brett
in
this
one
but
somehow
there
is
a
slight
funk
not
sure
of
tommes
secret
on
this
but
it
is
the
most
controlled
funk
i
have
come
across
in
a
saison
before
mouthfeel
is
yeasty
dry
spritzy
perfect
summer
quaffer
drinkability
is
perfection
a
phenomenal
warm
weather
beer
probably
the
best
saison
i
have
had
in
years
its
like
a
lighter
more
refreshing
avec
fantastic
job
drinkability
refreshing
and
quite
tasty
a
real
mouthpleaser
d
pretty
tasty
and
easy
drinking
id
have
another
if
i
had
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
slight
head
what
head
there
is
sticks
around
as
a
swirly
cap
the
aroma
is
an
intereesting
combo
of
earthypiney
hops
and
some
typical
saison
aromas
of
belgian
yeast
coriander
white
pepper
and
citrus
rind
pretty
pleasant
taste
has
similar
components
with
a
fairly
pronounced
bitterness
at
the
end
lots
of
citrus
rind
flavors
here
these
american
hopped
belgian
styles
seem
all
the
rage
for
certain
breweries
now
and
while
this
shares
some
of
those
typical
flavor
components
it
doesnt
go
overboard
with
the
hops
or
spicing
and
achieves
a
nice
balance
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
bit
soft
in
the
mouth
i
need
a
litttle
more
bracing
pepperiness
or
herbal
zing
in
my
saison
still
quite
nice
for
american
everyday
saisons
id
take
hennepin
esp
since
its
a
for
a
couple
dollars
less
that
shouldnt
take
away
from
this
as
being
one
of
the
better
american
versions
i
like
this
one
its
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
its
much
lighter
than
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
lost
abbey
lineup
but
its
tasty
and
very
sessionable
pours
a
foggy
toasted
gold
with
a
puffy
white
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
some
stickiness
on
the
sides
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
though
smell
consists
of
yeast
banana
clove
and
pepper
some
honey
and
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
find
their
way
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
fluffy
banana
and
spices
but
nothing
over
the
top
very
calm
and
clean
sweet
honey
throughout
hops
show
up
towards
the
end
with
a
slight
citrus
zest
and
a
somewhat
puckering
mouthfeel
i
was
hoping
for
more
in
the
hops
department
though
after
reading
the
description
mild
carbonation
for
the
style
with
a
light
to
medium
body
another
americanized
belgian
not
bad
though
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
one
during
a
warm
summer
night
luckily
i
have
another
bottle
to
do
just
that
definitely
worth
a
try
the
body
is
mid
but
high
for
style
overall
this
is
more
of
a
funky
belgian
wit
but
some
nice
positive
qualities
to
really
enjoy
750ml
corked
bottle
purchased
from
the
beverage
warehouse
in
la
for
8
99
this
was
my
second
lost
abbey
beer
and
it
matched
the
style
very
well
the
smell
was
funky
with
aromas
of
grass
spice
maybe
some
apple
and
generally
good
things
the
taste
was
just
like
the
smell
very
funky
and
addictive
i
think
this
competes
well
with
any
saison
ive
had
to
date
including
the
best
from
dupont
highly
recommended
d
a
really
nice
ale
from
lost
abbey
had
it
with
an
italian
style
dinner
it
really
hit
the
spot
another
winner
from
tomme
arthur
drinkability
is
very
good
not
a
great
beer
but
a
very
good
one
all
in
all
a
nice
and
interesting
saison
this
is
my
first
beer
from
lost
abbey
though
ive
had
port
brewing
before
if
this
is
any
indication
on
their
beer
quality
then
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
this
was
a
real
let
down
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
drinking
a
saison
or
a
witte
either
way
it
wasnt
very
impressive
if
they
somehow
kicked
up
the
flavor
and
made
it
more
rich
it
would
have
some
legs
but
its
just
not
there
d
i
am
torn
on
this
beer
it
drinks
like
a
wit
but
is
billed
as
saisonstyle
it
is
a
decent
wit
but
a
poor
saison
give
it
a
shot
if
you
can
but
it
is
leaving
me
conflicted
d
carnevale
is
just
ok
more
carbonation
and
a
little
more
assertiveness
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
its
lost
abbey
and
they
can
and
do
make
far
better
beers
purchased
patron
saints
lost
abbey
brews
have
always
been
a
bit
of
a
hit
or
miss
experience
for
me
this
ones
clearly
a
miss
i
was
kind
of
taken
aback
by
some
of
the
high
reviews
as
this
beer
while
solid
is
not
one
of
their
upper
tier
efforts
if
this
was
priced
in
the
three
to
five
dollar
range
id
probably
chalk
it
up
as
an
interesting
experiment
and
maybe
buy
a
few
to
sample
later
at
8
99
though
there
are
far
better
options
amongst
lost
abbey
offerings
let
alone
other
breweries
overall
this
was
another
knockout
from
tomme
and
crew
i
have
said
it
before
there
are
two
breweries
that
are
just
consistently
outstanding
for
me
lost
abbey
and
pisgah
lost
abbey
though
is
a
whole
new
level
and
this
just
reinforces
it
if
you
can
get
this
you
must
it
is
insanely
good
and
well
deserving
of
any
hype
well
balanced
and
refreshing
it
will
go
down
better
in
summer
well
perhaps
california
is
warmer
than
wisconsin
now
overall
another
quality
brew
by
lost
abbey
a
nice
saison
for
a
80
degree
florida
winter
day
it
was
pretty
good
tasting
and
rather
refreshing
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
bottom
line
this
saison
is
hitting
my
taste
buds
really
well
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
my
thanks
to
joey
for
grabbing
some
for
me
easy
to
drink
and
im
excited
about
trying
more
down
the
line
but
i
feel
like
one
bottle
for
the
cellar
is
plenty
i
see
this
one
as
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
it
has
characteristics
of
each
to
me
but
having
said
so
thoroughly
enjoyable
one
of
the
lower
abv
beers
i
have
had
from
lost
abbey
but
tasty
indeed
good
refreshing
taste
with
alcohol
well
hidden
a
balanced
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
highly
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
probably
wouldve
gone
better
with
a
hot
summer
day
and
some
babes
in
bikinis
rather
than
me
sitting
here
freezing
on
a
friday
watching
ufc
i
think
if
you
like
the
grapefruit
overtones
in
your
beer
that
you
need
to
try
this
one
it
isnt
my
favorite
flavor
but
for
what
it
is
a
saison
its
right
on
target
with
the
description
of
what
it
should
be
another
tasty
addition
to
the
lost
abbey
lineup
o
this
is
a
really
nice
saisonfarmhouse
ale
it
is
not
the
most
complex
example
of
the
style
out
there
but
it
tastes
great
and
is
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
looks
and
smells
fine
but
the
taste
is
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
saison
the
main
flavor
that
i
got
was
quite
vegetal
maybe
im
missing
the
boat
on
this
one
but
i
cant
say
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
a
marvelous
brew
that
i
would
highly
recommend
extremely

i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
such
a
funky
or
is
that
the
lemon
on
the
label
confusing
me
the
brewers
have
taken
time
to
note
on
twitter
there
is
no
citrus
in
the
batch
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
just
a
note
of
tartness
a
spice
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel

hope
to

5if
i
could
give
bonus
points
for
the
awesomely
goofy
brewermade
artwork
and
description
a
good
saison
nothing
groundbreaking
but
solid
on
tap
at
bruery
provisions
fragrant
heady
light
golden
beer
quite
a
slash
of
hops
very
appealing
at
first
sip
but
in
the
end
the
bitterness
is
more
than
the
delicate
flavors
can
sustain
pleasant
citrus
taste
and
acidity
with
an
earthy
nose
fresh
cut
apple
and
a
touch
of
something
like
artichoke
toasted
brioche
and
white
grapes
nice
head
in
the
tulip
glass
but
the
carbonation
fades
before
two
people
can
share
the
22ouncer
i
will
still
buy
whatever
these
people
concoct
though
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
overall
thanks
much
to
jlindros
for
this
bottle
id
had
this
once
before
in
a
trade
though
there
was
no
date
on
that
bottle
and
i
was
greatly
disappointed
by
it
this
on
the
other
hand
is
quite
nice
im
typically
not
a
huge
fan
of
americanstyle
saisons
tons
of
american
hops
or
high
levels
of
bitterness
for
example
preferring
the
more
earthy
funky
and
fruity
versions
this
however
is
pretty
tasty
the
lemon
curd
flavors
nice
hint
of
malt
and
somewhat
herbal
leafy
hops
meld
well
together
i
have
no
idea
what
this
costs
as
its
not
available
here
but
if
it
went
for
around
78
dollars
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
few
bombers
of
this
for
warm
weather
sipping
pours
a
vibrant
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
bubbly
purewhite
head
the
head
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
tiny
batches
of
wet
lacing
behind
it
smells
of
funky
yeast
straw
hay
freshlycut
grass
pepper
and
light
citrus
notes
it
tastes
very
similar
beginning
with
the
straw
grass
and
citrus
lemon
orange
notes
moving
into
a
funky
yeast
flavor
and
finishing
with
the
peppery
hops
there
seems
however
to
be
a
slightly
metallic
medicinal
flavor
that
predominates
the
finish
and
leaves
an
odd
taste
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
finishes
cleanly
overall
a
good
saison
save
for
the
odd
flavor
towards
the
end
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
saison
and
i
would
definitely
seek
it
out
again
the
pepper
is
a
little
bit
over
powering
i
feel
that
this
could
be
even
better
if
there
was
not
so
much
pepper
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
the
nose
is
just
splendid
basil
thyme
citrus
and
an
indian
summer
grassiness
that
morphs
as
you
drink
certainly
unique
and
in
my
opinion
exceptionally
robust
once
you
take
a
drink
youll
notice
a
bit
less
bubbles
than
you
expected
but
give
it
a
swish
and
i
guarandangtee
youll
enjoy
how
this
one
excites
palate
give
it
a
chew
why
dont
you
the
taste
is
fantastic
just
as
your
nose
hinted
youve
got
some
earthiness
but
mostly
a
bright
citrus
taste
thats
just
ready
to
burst
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
their
brews
they
label
the
bombers
with
bottled
stickers
get
one
fresh
and
drink
it
up
before
the
weather
gets
too
cold
overall
its
a
nice
fun
beer
alot
going
on
light
and
fresh
wide
range
of
notes
and
flavors
good
summer
drinkability
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
if
not
a
little
dear
o
definitely
not
your
typical
saison
but
a
great
american
take
on
it
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
relatively
available
on
the
east
coast
o
very
muted
and
mild
flavors
overall
a
decent
saison
but
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
overall
not
as
interesting
or
complex
as
id
have
hoped
the
bitterness
really
outshines
the
other
subtler
flavor
aspects
of
this
beer
didnt
really
excite
me
too
much
kind
of
onenote
very
fresh
and
aromatic
with
aromas
of
citrus
spice
tones
with
some
malts
and
grain
tones
as
well
medium
bodied
with
a
real
good
feel
this
is
a
really
good
domestic
saison
that
plays
to
a
more
citrusy
side
overall
definitely
fits
the
farmhouse
style
very
drinkable
and
perfect
on
a
cool
summer
night
this
is
a
classic
if
thats
even
possible
example
of
an
american
saison
hoppy
dry
and
downright
delicious
a
pleasant
saison
but
it
didnt
blow
my
hair
back
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
inclined
to
get
it
again
with
more
preferable
options
in
the
same
price
range
but
def
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
yet
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
little
to
no
foam
it
looks
vibrant
smells
every
bit
as
dynamic
a
wonderful
pronounced
yeasty
aroma
theres
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bite
in
the
taste
a
hoppy
saison
but
dramatically
different
from
the
only
other
hoppy
saison
ive
tried
theres
a
dry
finish
to
this
beer
distinct
and
bold
going
out
on
a
limb
here
but
i
think
i
catch
some
coriander
as
well
thick
mouthfeel
enjoyed
it
as
it
warmed
and
released
more
of
that
wonderful
aroma
bit
of
an
acidic
finish
towards
the
end
but
not
offputting
id
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
off
the
pour
and
first
smell
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
wow
i
was
a
little
surprised
now
i
see
why
its
called
a
saison
americaine
a
solid
saison
with
a
nice
hop
presense
maybe
american
hops
not
sure
very
smooth
and
dangerously
drinkable
definatly
an
affordable
price
tag
as
well
something
worth
revisiting
a
really
drinkable
beer
where
what
is
lacking
in
flavour
adds
up
to
genuine
quaffability
plus
its
intriguing
enough
for
it
not
to
be
a
flop
notes
nothing
mindblowing
here
and
im
not
sure
the
extreme
hype
is
deserved
but
so
far
all
ive
tried
from
pretty
things
feels
like
solid
stimulating
quality
so
what
is
not
to
like
overall
is
really
good
and
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
for
sure
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
woodsy
quality
in
the
nose
joining
blunting
muted
presences
of
yeast
and
spices
a
touch
of
funk
tastes
more
lively
although
the
thickish
body
seems
to
bog
things
down
a
bit
the
hop
bitterness
seems
to
cut
through
the
body
more
effectively
than
the
spices
cloves
allspice
white
pepper
or
tanginess
sweetened
lemon
yeast
a
vague
sour
presence
modest
funkiness
develops
as
it
warms
id
love
to
see
some
more
of
the
earthy
and
spicy
notes
coaxed
out
of
this
compared
to
uppertier
saisons
jack
dor
is
somewhat
lacking
in
oomph
but
pretty
tasty
and
worth
a
try
o
token
example
of
this
style
for
sure
i
will
be
seeking
out
lots
more
from
pretty
things
now
that
they
are
readily
available
in
my
area
o
a
good
saison
i
didnt
know
pretty
things
was
distributing
here
so
am
jumped
on
it
doubt
i
will
see
it
on
tap
again
but
i
would
give
it
another
shot
bomber
poured
into
my
saison
dupont
glass
opaque
straw
color
almost
milky
with
a
coif
of
white
foam
that
settles
back
into
more
of
a
combover
aroma
is
bright
alternatingly
fruity
and
musty
citrus
peel
and
soggy
hay
candied
orange
and
cobwebs
honey
fresh
laundry
the
flavor
seems
restrained
at
first
like
theres
something
vivid
struggling
to
get
out
but
its
truncated
by
a
mineral
character
that
approaches
astringency
still
a
mild
unripe
mango
fruitiness
is
detectable
along
with
some
dry
pale
malts
and
leafy
noble
hops
with
a
clean
peppery
finish
i
was
hoping
this
would
come
out
of
its
shell
with
warmth
but
no
such
luck
the
only
development
i
get
is
a
more
lingering
astringency
and
a
little
more
sweetness
palate
is
also
a
bit
off
the
carbonation
is
inappropriately
low
giving
this
beer
a
soft
but
unsatisfying
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
id
say
this
needs
some
finetuning
a
good
nonbelgian
saison
but
far
from
my
favourite
it
feels
like
it
paints
the
broad
strokes
of
the
style
well
but
misses
the
little
details
it
doesnt
have
a
true
complexity
it
doesnt
have
the
acidity
and
it
doesnt
have
the
interesting
organic
funk
of
a
great
example
and
thats
a
bit
of
a
shame
t
i
get
lemon
rind
orange
zest
dry
champagne
yeast
and
a
little
sage
the
finish
is
super
bitter
with
a
big
hit
of
something
that
tastes
like
aspirin
not
the
most
pleasant
finish
this
loses
points
for
me
solely
on
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
solid
o
this
one
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
a
let
down
the
bitterness
sort
of
killed
off
any
chance
the
flavors
had
to
mesh
notes
just
enough
american
hops
to
make
things
interesting
and
add
to
the
complexity
great
beer
o
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
overall
a
very
unique
beer
extremely
well
balanced
and
yet
still
complex
and
flavorful
enough
to
be
interesting
its
not
overwhelming
though
either
and
is
still
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
good
saison
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
id
probably
buy
it
again
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
especially
considering
the
tripartite
nature
of
the
mouthful
as
the
flavors
change
true
the
combination
is
a
bit
strange
and
did
leave
me
wondering
what
i
was
drinking
but
the
result
was
immensely
flavorful
and
worth

overall
this
is

pretty
drinkable
body
is
on

light
side
to
maybe
a
medium
not
delicious
though
prosit
overall
id
like
to
get
more
a
lot
more
for
generally
being
a
porterstout
guy
i
really
enjoyed
this
ship
some
to
wi
ill
be
waiting
od
i
havent
had
many
saisons
but
i
would
venture
to
guess
this
is
one
of
the
hoppiest
im
a
fan
of
strong
hop
flavor
so
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
o
really
really
quality
ale
from
pretty
things
they
continue
to
impress
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
night
on
the
porch
highly
recommended
sightly
hazy
with
massive
carbonation
bright
golden
color
and
a
three
finger
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
floral
and
rustic
yeasty
and
bready
as
well
the
tastes
follows
the
nose
but
with
a
lot
more
complexity
floral
fruity
and
spice
white
peppercorns
dry
rustic
bread
like
yeasty
notes
hints
of
apple
and
husky
malt
also
the
finish
is
really
hoppy
bitter
and
citrusy
for
a
saison
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
loads
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
smooth
and
slighty
rustic
very
dry
a
really
nice
and
refreshing
saison
glad
these
guys
are
finally
getting
distributed
out
west
a
really
solid
brewery
from
eery
thing
i
have
tried
so
far
the
beer
was
bottled
in
may
2011
batch
26
and
was
tasted
on
13
jul
2011
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
banana
but
i
dont
mind
that
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
o
a
very
servicable
saison
above
average
but
not
the
standout
i
expected
still
a
nice
brew
but
a
bit
overpriced
o
this
is
a
pretty
beer
that
tastes
and
smells
very
refined
but
is
not
what
i
typically
expect
from
a
saison
however
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
convert
wine
drinkers
to
craft
beer
o
just
a
very
very
good
saison
from
the
folks
over
at
pretty
things
youre
really
hard
pressed
to
find
a
bad
brew
from
these
guys
this
like
most
others
are
a
definate
must
buy
o
this
had
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
very
nice
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
saison
and
just
a
really
good
beer
in
general
i
think
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
to
it
its
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
day
i
recommend
trying
it
d
hops
maybe
overwhelm
slightly
on
the
palate
with
the
fruity
esters
not
as
up
front
as
i
would
like
nevertheless
a
nice
summer
thirst
quencher
overall
something
maybe
up
with
this
still
not
really
badi
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
i
always
hear
great
things
about
this
beer
o
a
top
notch
american
saison
extremely
flavorful
yet
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
on
a
hot
summer
day
even
for
a
saison
jack
dor
is
very
dry
it
starts
of
rustic
and
somewhat
sweet
and
about
midway
those
flavors
go
way
and
in
comes
the
bitterness
and
dryness
that
seem
to
last
perhaps
a
bit
too
bitter
at
times
though
however
that
isnt
enough
to
keep
me
away
from
this
beer
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
that
endaftertaste
of
pepper
more
pepper
turned
me
off
o
interesting
take
on
a
saison
not
what
i
expected
but
not
a
disappointment
either
the
6
4
abv
is
well
hidden
and
if
you
like
the
tartness
you
could
session
this
one
unusual
enough
that
ill
seek
out
other
beers
from
this
brewery
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
on
your
deck
on
a
june
afternoon
o
this
is
one
damn
fine
take
on
a
saison
one
of
my
favorite
interpretations
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
not
many
beers
beat
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
pretty
impressive
and
interesting
saison
my
first
try
from
pretty
things
and
it
is
worth
seeking
out
again
d
although
groundbreak
and
cynic
ale
definitely
top
jack
the
dry
flavors
create
a
very
drinkable
saison
i
recommend
this
and
will
grab
more
overall
a
great
summer
beer
that
i
would
try
again
enjoyable
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
funk
an
average
saison
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
a
touch
heavy
on
the
pepper
and
lemon
i
am
really
wanting
to
like
pt
brews
but
so
far
they
just
havent
wowd
me
i
have
a
few
more
to
try
and
would
like
to
get
my
hands
on
a
finest
regards
i
didnt
catch
how
old
this
bottle
was
so
i
will
definitely
try
to
get
my
hands
on
a
fresh
bottle
sometime
to
revisit
this
beer
o
pretty
nice
saison
here
rustic
reasonable
abv
just
a
tad
heavy
on
the
pepperiness
great
summer
brew
its
a
great
beer
for
sure
in
general
i
might
seek
this
one
out
again
dirtybeerguy
com
brings
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
to
the
table
without
any
of
them
being
too
out
of
hand
a
nice
balance
drinks
easily
and
would
be
a
nice
saison
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
what
it
lacks
in
smell
it
makes
up
in
appearance
and
ever
moreso
taste
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
from
the
tap
one
day
i
want
more
and
at
a
mere
6
4
i
can
probably
have
another
and
another
my
only
fear
is
that
this
is
so
good
i
may
not
know
when
to
stop
fortunately
or
unfortunately
rather
i
only
had
the
one
bottle
to
enjoy
o
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
is
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
tasty
odi
had
been
putting
off
trying
this
brew
for
a
while
i
would
love
to
grab
a
few
of
these
here
and
there
especially
for
the
summer
great
brew
pretty
things
is
a
nice
brewery
i
cannot
decide
do
i
like
this
or
american
darling
more
right
now
with
a
cool
glass
of
jack
dor
next
to
me
i
gotta
say
im
going
with
jack
a
deep
gold
to
pale
amber
color
and
cloudy
it
is
unfiltered
the
brew
was
positively
glowing
and
radiant
in
the
sunlight
a
generous
three
finger
head
white
and
frothy
and
left
complex
lacing
just
above
the
finish
the
appearance
was
really
quite
sublime
the
aroma
was
complex
yeasty
with
peppery
phenols
slight
malt
and
a
whiff
of
orange
peels
taste
was
subtly
citric
with
medium
spice
and
bitterness
hops
were
cleancrisp
and
the
malts
toasty
felt
creamy
with
a
medium
body
yet
very
drinkable
this
brew
was
enjoyed
on
a
roofdeck
during
a
beautiful
70
sunny
afternoon
and
is
perfect
for
such
an
occasion
overall
grade
cd
i
like
saisons
but
this
one
was
mediocre
o
my
first
pretty
things
brew
did
not
disappoint
a
very
solid
saison
that
i
need
to
get
more
of
to
cellar
for
a
while
as
i
feel
like
it
could
dry
out
and
be
a
better
beer
this
is
a
light
easytodrink
beer
and
while
its
not
the
best
farmhouse
ive
had
its
a
good
version
of
the
style
with
some
unique
tastes
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
probably
drink
again
had
a
sample
of
this
on
tap
at
the
2010
acbf
i
tried
a
bunch
of
pretty
things
that
day
including
this
one
the
look
of
the
beer
is
nice
strong
hazy
golden
body
with
a
decent
white
head
on
it
the
aromas
were
hard
to
pick
up
for
some
reason
that
day
on
this
beer
it
was
mostly
a
little
funky
with
some
wheat
and
some
citrus
in
there
perhaps
the
taste
was
kind
of
light
to
me
as
well
i
felt
like
i
wasnt
able
to
pull
anything
from
this
brew
there
were
some
flavors
that
resembled
the
style
well
i
did
pick
up
the
farmhouse
taste
with
some
wheat
and
citrus
in
there
with
just
a
bit
of
tartiness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
i
thought
i
really
sure
buy
and
bottle
and
check
this
one
out
again
overall
pretty
good
a
bit
heavy
overall
on
the
flavors
from
what
i
usually
like
for
saisons
but
its
still
a
great
saison
spices
a
bit
too
high
hops
are
added
well
nice
wheat
flavors
and
fruits
all
blended
well
and
nice
dry
finish
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
too
impressive
to
me
cheers
beertracker
overall
its
pretty
nice
its
quite
complex
for
such
a
light
feeling
beer
and
still
tasty
very
nice
thick
foam
that
lasts
throughout
the
session
hazy
color
light
golden
really
nice
aroma
bananna
great
belgian
yeast
character
no
sulfur
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
makes
the
beer
seem
to
have
so
much
body
but
still
finish
so
dry
some
hop
character
some
lingering
bitterness
first
sip
was
crisp
and
refreshing
half
way
through
and
i
am
pondering
how
this
simple
beer
tastes
more
complex
and
bright
with
each
sip
first
taste
from
this
project
first
review
on
ba
and
definitely
need
to
explore
their
other
offerings
highly
recommend
this
one
this
one
is
all
about
the
light
fruits
and
the
yeast
pears
and
apples
are
the
first
thing
on
my
mind
as
i
smell
and
sip
this
a
citrus
hint
comes
into
play
tooonly
kinda
dry
but
this
bottle
is
only
5
months
old
i
think
i
might
let
the
other
3
sit
a
bit
and
see
if
they
get
dryer
i
think
that
is
what
this
one
needs
o
another
fine
beer
by
pretty
things
its
a
complex
brew
with
some
really
good
things
going
for
it
i
however
dont
really
care
for
the
peppery
and
bitter
finish
which
seems
to
take
away
from
the
overall
taste
of
it
oan
interesting
beer
not
one
of
my
favorites
by
i
enjoyed
sampling
it
the
wheatyeast
for
my
taste
is
a
little
overpowering
but
worth
sampling
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
overall
easy
to
drink
beer
thats
light
maybe
a
little
too
grassy
but
it
does
go
well
with
spicy
food
like
indian
curries
jd
o
fairly
drinkable
but
a
bit
drier
than
is
my
preference
im
impressed
this
is
a
very
very
good
example
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
and
in
the
spirit
of
what
a
saison
is
supposed
to
embody
think
light
flavorful
and
perfect
for
a
seasonal
endeavour
overall
just
a
well
done
and
enjoyable
saison
while
it
may
not
be
anything
too
fancy
it
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
saison
oreally
great
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
pretty
things
moutfeel
is
very
nice
crisp
but
retaining
a
nice
smooth
finish
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
relatively
light
body
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
saisons
ive
ever
had
and
one
to
seek
out
particularly
if
you
more
enjoy
clean
less
funky
saisons
drink
a
very
good
craft
saison
a
little
funk
sweet
and
delictate
citrus
i
paired
this
with
a
mahimahi
filet
for
easter
and
was
very
good
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
to
me
this
is
what
a
saison
should
taste
like
highly
recommended
a
very
unique
and
drinkable
beer
pours
an
unfiltered
golden
yellow
finger
of
dense
creamy
head
leaves
a
collar
mild
lacing
and
retention
nose
holds
lots
of
dry
bread
notes
wheat
bright
citrus
lemongrassiness
hopped
nicely
very
american
take
on
the
style
some
banana
and
phenolic
notes
that
feel
a
bit
out
of
place
but
smells
great
integrated
with
this
taste
has
the
wheat
lemon
and
citrus
mouthfeel
gets
dry
real
quick
and
adds
some
spice
in
the
finish
great
mouthfeel
dry
and
refreshing
summer
day
perfection
impressive
and
an
interesting
american
take
on
the
style
do
this
saison
is
a
predictable
americanbrewed
example
in
some
respects
comparable
to
the
bruerys
saison
rue
or
lost
abbeys
red
barn
the
composed
flavor
profile
comes
across
as
superior
to
most
making
this
beer
resonate
in
the
memory
as
a
really
strong
example
of
the
style
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
presentation
o
its
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
id
go
crazy
for
its
a
good
representation
of
the
style
without
going
too
extreme
with
extra
flavors
its
good
to
support
small
breweries
and
its
easy
to
do
so
at
the
current
price
point
was
able
to
get
many
pretty
things
bombers
for
about
6
each
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
quicly
diminishing
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
slighty
funky
aroma
with
lemon
hay
and
yeast
taste
has
good
hop
bitterness
up
front
along
with
citrus
spices
honey
and
bread
medium
bodied
this
is
wellbalanced
and
has
good
complexity
extremly
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
unique
saison
that
does
not
play
it
safe
a
definite
success
for
pretty
things
as
they
have
crafted
one
heck
of
an
american
saison
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
nice
pillow
of
white
on
top
smells
of
spice
clove
and
lavender
bready
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
peppery
slightly
tart
herbal
esters
and
faint
hops
yeast
is
very
present
in
the
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
slightly
chalky
and
tannic
dry
it
represents
the
style
well
although
not
my
favorite
saison
good
but
not
great
imho
o
a
fantastic
drinking
saison
well
done
light
and
refreshing
yet
full
bodied
enough
to
match
with
many
foods
im
thinking
grilled
shrimplemon
kabobs
with
chipotlehoney
polenta
and
a
baby
greens
salad
with
a
grapefruithoney
vinegrette
fire
up

grill
pours
a
clear
and
very
pale
yelloworange
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
decent
rings
of
lace
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
belgian
yeast
spices
citrus
hops
and
maybe
some
wheat
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
with
the
belgian
yeast
coming
out
the
most
the
smell
and
taste
remind
me
very
much
of
a
wit
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
prickly
and
bubbly
on
the
palate
overall
a
good
beer
but
its
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
at
a
local
shop
d
good
overall
to
me
nothing
earth
shattering
though
d
very
drinkable
dry
mouthfeel
is
really
great
a
bit
different
than
an
average
saison
but
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
bottled
nov
2009
batch
10
pours
a
hazy
golden
blonde
with
clear
lacing
small
white
head
aroma
dominated
by
bubble
gum
some
sweet
malt
mild
hops
and
kumquat
taste
is
dominated
by
vinegar
like
sour
and
maybe
unripe
honeydew
really
not
very
pleasing
i
recognize
an
american
interpretation
of
a
saison
should
have
a
bit
of
funk
but
i
doubt
this
is
the
taste
they
were
going
for
should
this
beer
have
fallen
apart
in
1
5
years
even
at
only
6
4
abv
this
should
have
held
up
i
just
want
to
move
on
and
get
this
taste
out
of
my
mouth
a
friend
shared
this
with
me
it
had
a
1
49
sticker
on
it
maybe
it
was
marked
down
because
of
its
age
bright
and
golden
yellow
faint
orange
hint
not
a
lot
of
head
but
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
rim
a
lot
of
bubbles
coming
up
instantly
got
a
lot
of
aroma
just
from
cracking
the
cap
smell
is
very
spicy
and
zesty
coriander
belgian
yeast
and
banana
a
faint
amount
of
a
hoppy
citrus
zest
for
the
lack
of
hops
in
the
nose
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
the
bitterness
and
dryness
is
very
present
a
dirty
extremely
astringent
hop
character
is
very
present
with
a
fierce
lemon
zest
the
belgian
yeast
characteristics
are
there
at
first
but
are
taken
over
by
the
bitter
hop
assault
almost
sour
not
sure
how
to
interpret
this
one
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
palate
quality
flavor
refreshing
profile
and
something
id
drink
again
overall
very
enjoyable
a
bit
different
than
other
saisons
ive
had
more
malt
and
hop
focused
but
still
with
a
nice
yeast
backing
da
little
too
hoppy
for
me
but
all
the
elements
come
together
nicely
another
well
made
beer
by
pretty
things
great
light
body
and
crisp
feeling
this
one
is
super
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
retasted
on
7311
considerably
worse
than
the
first
time
i
had
it
flavors
were
completely
muddled
the
abv
oddly
started
showing
and
it
almost
gained
a
wine
corked
wet
cardboard
taste
i
didnt
change
the
score
as
i
felt
it
doesnt
deserve
to
be
changed
but
after
a
few
months
this
is
showing
very
poorly
maybe
i
just
dont
get
jack
dor
great
drinkability
and
great
pairing
with
really
creamy
buttery
cheeses
bottled
february
2011
so
excited
to
try
this
one
ive
heard
great
things
about
pretty
things
and
never
seen
it
in
california
until
today
pours
a
very
beautiful
bright
almost
clear
goldenyellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
extremely
quickly
scent
is
very
funky
with
some
lemon
zest
and
peppery
notes
i
also
get
a
bit
of
bread
and
hoppiness
with
nice
yeast
scents
taste
is
initially
hoppy
quickly
followed
by
some
funk
and
delicious
spiciness
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
saison
if
you
ask
me
there
is
a
bit
of
lemon
and
citrus
along
with
a
lot
of
hoppiness
very
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
dry
refreshing
overall
my
first
impression
of
pretty
things
is
a
good
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
nose
is
primarily
yeast
and
the
mouthfeel
is
balanced
yeast
and
hop
the
flavor
profile
besides
yeast
and
light
hop
tastes
of
citrus
and
is
quite
refreshing
this
is
particularly
complex
for
a
farmhouse
ale
and
keeps
you
thinking
about
it
long
after
you
finish
enjoying
it
o
very
complex
beer
the
bitter
aftertaste
is
offputting
for
me
personally
though
many
hopheads
will
rejoice
its
a
very
wellmade
brew
lots
of
creativity
involved
with
this
saison
americain
pale
golden

in

with
a
nice

some

hoppy
yeasty

lighter
in

crisp
smooth
clean
and
with
a
hint
of
creamyness
drink
is
great
and
very
easy
to
put
away
one
of
my
top
ten
saisons
on
a
short
list
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
good
depth
neat
hoppy
character
not
your
typical
saison
but
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
little
chewy
good
example
of
an
american
saison
light
on
the
funk
bigger
on
the
hops
but
nice
character
and
very
refreshing
thanks
russ

highly
drinkable

they
never

me
wrong
just
wish
i
was
closer
to
their

thanks
again
evan
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
try
this
brew

a

nice

good

drinks
very
nicely
perhaps
slightly
too
much
dry
yeastiness
good
overall
and
would
certainly
pick
this
one
up
again
d
at
6
5
this
beer
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
and
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
if
i
see
it
around
on
clearance
again
ill
buy
as
much
as
i
can
d
wouldnt
bother
drinking
this
again
esp
for
8
a
bomber
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
saison
to
keep
coming
back
to
and
pretty
things
does
a
great
job
with
the
lemon
flavors
which
also
sets
this
saison
apart
from
the
norm
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
two
pours
a
bright
foggy
yellow
with
a
big
2
finger
head
in
my
duvel
glass
head
takes
a
good
amount
of
time
to
recede
with
decent
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
smells
that
come
through
up
front
are
of
peppercorns
light
bubblegum
and
little
to
no
hop
recognition
but
upon
tasting
i
realize
that
there
is
a
hop
presence
here
that
shows
through
very
well
without
getting
in
the
way
of
that
awesome
yeast
character
this
beer
is
smooth
with
a
good
crisp
carbonation
bite
that
makes
it
refreshing
all
around
i
would
drink
this
all
day
if
they
distributed
to
oregon
holy
cow
wow
what
a
great
brew
enjoyed
one
of
these
with
with
my
ba
buddy
y2korey
who
brought
one
of
these
down
for
me
from
new
york
this
saison
starts
with
a
nice
deep
hazy
golden
color
and
has
a
nice
light
nose
the
taste
is
amazing
and
very
complex
so
that
it
hits
your
taste
buds
in
all
the
right
places
excellent
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mmm
d
can
you
say
6
pack
would
love
to
session
this
one
the
is
a
very
drinkable
beverage
it
is
one
of
the
drier
saisons
that
i
have
had
but
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
tasty
i
think
it
is
a
really
swell
example
of
the
style
and
it
held
up
well
with
a
little
age
on
it
d
the
bitterness
ramps
up
pretty
hard
on
your
palate
a
shame
too
i
really
enjoyed
the
rest
of
the
profile
appearance
is
orange
golden
with
a
two
finger
head
initially
smell
has
yeast
citrus
zest
spices
such
as
pepper
too
taking
a
sip
of
this
farmhouse
style
from
pretty
things
it
tastes
candied
with
yeast
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
mf
is
medium
with
some
good
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
easily
and
is
a
very
good
saison
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
an
excellent
bomber
from
a
very
good
trade
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
delicious
but
the
bitterness
might
prohibit
sessionability
eh
not
bad
but
a
weird
mix
of
flavors
the
belgian
side
is
nice
and
is
strong
but
itd
be
better
if
they
toned
down
the
hops
alot
or
just
left
it
a
regular
saison
or
at
least
got
rid
of
the
weird
ultralemonmedicinalcleaning
product
aspect
drinkability
really
took
me
by
surprise
at
first
with
the
sharpness
and
bitterness
and
the
bready
wheatesque
aromas
this
beer
is
quite
unique
to
anything
i
have
had
or
enjoy
regularly
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
but
now
that
i
am
living
back
in
the
area
yearround
i
am
getting
to
drink
local
a
lot
more
often
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
would
have
it
again
d
great
a
very
very
well
made
saison
one
of
the
best
to
come
out
of
the
usa
by
far
this
is
really
pale
straw
in
color
with
a
white
foam
the
aroma
is
a
bready
lemony
tart
aroma
the
flavor
is
strongly
of
lemon
zest
a
lemon
tart
biscuit
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
only
way
to
explain
this
beer
its
good
for
a
saison
but
its
really
odd
strong
lemon
flavor
makes
this
beer
seem
still
rather
one
dimensional
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
jack
dov
has
been
popped
dont
ask
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
lemongrass
coriander
orange
peel
flesh
lemon
zest
and
black
pepper
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sharp
lemon
lemon
peel
orange
peel
coriander
light
blanket
and
sharply
bitter
flowers
and
greens
the
bitterness
here
near
the
end
is
a
bit
too
sharp
for
my
liking
the
body
is
a
heftyfeeling
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
saison
though
that
finish
is
not
a
friend
of
mine
personally
id
rather
reach
for
a
lot
of
other
things
but
i
can
say
that
this
one
is
nicely
drinkable
its
quite
nicely
balanced
and
at
only
6
50abv
it
wont
hit
you
in
the
head
with
its
alcohol
d
very
enjoyable
glad
i
tried
it
a
good
hoppy
example
of
the
style
d
could
drink
these
all
day
not
sure
id
grab
this
next
time
with
huge
enthusiasm
notes
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
absolutely
delicious
and
i
cannot
wait
to
have
another
one
of
the
best
and
most
impressive
beers
ive
had
lately
a
fairly
good
saison
if
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
for
me
this
is
a
first
taste
from
this
brewery
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
bronze
in
color
and
a
bit
cloudy
sharp
fresh
nose
with
fruity
floral
and
spicy
aromas
palate
is
impressive
complex
layers
of
flavors
apple
orange
banana
coriander
sourdough
and
a
touch
of
peppery
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fluid
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
incredible
drinkability
from
start
to
finish
awesome
take
on
the
saison
style
a
must
try
drinkability
i
like
this
one
a
lot
it
would
be
a
very
good
warm
weather
beer
and
i
will
probably
search
it
out
again
some
time
i
would
have
rated
the
taste
higher
with
a
little
less
alcohol
and
bitterness
at
the
end
but
thats
just
nitpicking
quite
good
o
the
beer
really
is
a
good
one
and
my
first
from
the
pretty
things
brewery
to
me
this
beer
seemed
to
be
missing
something
it
was
good
overall
but
it
is
missing
something
that
i
expect
from
saisons
and
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
bottle
poured
a
bright
light
copper
color
ale
with
a
rather
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
malt
with
light
fruity
notes
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
with
nice
notes
of
belgianstyle
malt
with
some
light
fruity
ester
and
some
residual
sugar
body
is
full
with
a
somewhat
oily
texture
and
good
carbonation
not
as
floral
or
spicy
as
envisioned
but
very
interesting
nonetheless
d
the
light
body
along
with
the
yeast
and
spice
characteristics
make
it
similar
to
a
witbier
and
as
such
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
unfortunately
the
lingering
metallic
flavor
keeps
me
from
wanting
to
go
back
for
more
d
a
great
beer
i
would
visit
again
d
interesting
and
very
drinkable
the
more
quality
saisons
i
have
the
more
i
love
the
style
poured
a
2
head
which
took
a
while
but
totally
dissipated
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
good
effervescence
smell
of
hops
and
citrus
taste
was
on
the
mild
side
of
hops
although
a
pretty
light
beer
it
had
a
satisfying
mouthfeel
personally
i
dont
think
this
is
nearly
as
rich
as
other
saisons
but
its
still
very
enjoyable
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
this
maker
so
far
i
certainly
could
drink
this
daily
and
what
a
great
value
a
pint
for
about
6
peace
to
all
beerpeople
awesome
saison
good
to
see
a
mass
brewery

their
game
up
overall
a
very
good
offering
from
pretty
things

and
ale
project
between
this
and
baby
tree
pretty
things
is
shaping
up
to
be
a
very
exciting
brewery

certainly
recommend
this
beer
and
hope
that
you
will
pick
it
up
and
try
it
as
soon
as
you
can
cheers
d
very
solid
saison
all
the
flavors
youd
expect
where
there
and
the
pepper
adds
a
nice
touch
will
pick
this
one
up
again
i
found
this
beer
very
much
like
a
hefeweizen
in
flavor
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
has
a
golden
body
and
a
creamy
white
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
action
going
on
smells
sweet
and
peppery
clovey
noticeable
hop
clove
belgian
yeast
taste
very
crisp
feel
from
co2
the
beer
itself
velvety
good
beer
drink
on
d
a
great
saison
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
one
its
all
there
ive
heard
good
things
about
pretty
things
and
so
far
im
loving
it
thanks
again
michael
and
please
keep
them
coming
d
very
drinkable
this
is
designed
to
be
consumed
during
summer
months
i
can
totally
see
that
its
not
so
bad
in
the
winter
though
d
excellent
beer
and
a
musttry
for
all
lovers
of
belgian
and
belgianstyle
beers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
well
done
example
of
the
style
if
pt
was
available
up
here
in
maine
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
ton
of
this
in
the
summer
letting
this
beer
hang
out
in
the
glass
for
about
a
half
hour
really
brings
out
that
earth
that
i
love
so
dearly
in
saisons
this
is
a
great
beer
it
never
lets
me
down
d
love
this
beer
one
of
my
goto
beers
i
absolutely
cant
get
enough
of
it
another
great
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
drinkabilityi
really
enjoy
the
flavor
on
this
one
its
full
of
delightful
complexity
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
saisons
that
ive
ever
had
very
drinkable
nice
americanized
saison
o
a
very
good
american
interpretation
of
american
saison
something
about
the
taste
is
rubbing
me
the
wrong
way
but
definitely
enjoyable
id
drink
another
bottle
for
sure
d
solid
all
around
with
just
a
little
amp
due
to
the
massive
dryness
from
added
champagne
yeast
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
i
was
blown
away
by
the
flavors
and
think
it
worked
the
palate
perfectly
i
had
this
beer
paired
with
my
thanksgiving
meal
and
it
was
exceptional
i
would
highly
recommend
people
to
seek
this
one
out
regardless
of
whether
you
like
this
style
or
not
d
very
easy
to
drink
great
beer
d
really
great
my
glass
is
almost
finished
already
drinkability
saisons
are
a
very
drinkable
style
for
me
and
at
just
over
6
this
one
is
straightforward
and
unobstrusive
a
bomber
is
a
good
size
for
this
beer
has
a
thirst
quenching
property
that
makes
you
return
for
that
second
pint
well
done
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
well
put
together
saison
drinking
the
whole
bomber
should
be
a
pleasure
this
beer
is
a
picnic
in
a
bottle
it
emanates
nothing
but
sun
and
fun
radiates
relaxation
and
manifests
a
treasure
trunk
of
sensual
pleasantries
its
like
a
straw
was
inserted
directly
into
the
pleasure
center
of
my
brain
pretty
things
has
captured
all
the
best
features
of
american
and
belgian
brewing
and
forced
them
to
make
babies
the
children
look
a
little
like
their
mother
a
little
like
their
father
and
are
undeniably
pretty
d
this
would
have
been
a
great
beer
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
but
its
still
a
great
one
for
whatll
probably
be
the
last
warmish
day
of
the
year
while
nothing
about
this
beer
stands
out
as
phenomenal
every
aspect
of
this
beer
is
solid
and
works
together
to
create
a
very
pleasant
brew
if
this
were
available
locally
id
definitely
seek
it
out
again
d
really
drinkable
this
would
have
been
perfect
a
few
months
ago
when
it
was
miserably
humid
and
hitting
100
degrees
routinely
i
dont
know
what
i
was
really
expecting
in
this
beer
but
this
is
certainly
not
it
that
being
said
that
isnt
really
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
would
work
great
as
a
thirst
quencher
or
paired
with
a
nice
meal
a
solid
beer
for
sure
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
of
this
but
with
limited
suitcase
space
it
isnt
a
must
have
d
drinks
like
a
charm
being
quite
juicy
and
fruity
this
beer
begs
for
you
to
drink
it
swig
by
swig
but
do
not
succumb
to
its
charms
take
your
time
ive
always
said
i
dont
like
belgian
style
beers
but
i
enjoy
trying
different
varieties
to
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
if
youre
a
big
fan
of
this
style
id
recommend
victorys
golden
monkey
over
a
jack
dor
drink
low
abvpretty
easy
to
drink
a
little
too
gassyburpy
jack
dor
golden
jack
is
a
delicious
saison
that
can
hold
its
head
high
in
the
company
of
the
belgian
farmhouse
originals
pretty
things
beer
ale
project
continues
to
charm
and
impress
this
their
flagship
brew
is
an
easy
recommendation
drinkability
not
particularly
expensive
and
very
drinkable
however
if
im
looking
for
a
saison
this
wouldnt
always
scratch
my
itch
d
a
very
tasty
flavorful
saison
with
a
little
extra
lift
at
6
4
abv
its
crafted
quite
nicely
and
balanced
as
well
as
can
be
although
i
feel
it
is
distinctly
american
from
the
more
aggressive
than
normal
hop
acidity
in
addition
to
the
fruity
bitter
ale
flavors
a
quality
representation
of
an
underrated
style
d
this
is
a
very
very
tasty
saison
id
say
its
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
pretty
things
but
that
shouldnt
be
hard
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
different
and
enjoyable
drink
jack
dor
is
a
lovely
saison
it
starts
out
a
little
too
dry
for
my
tastes
but
eventually
reaches
equilibrium
and
turns
into
one
of
the
most
drinkable
saisons
ive
had
i
find
myself
taking
sip
after
sip
my
first
beer

not
my
last

decent
beer
overall
and
wellworth
a
try
points
for
the
great
label
artwork
too
bad
the
flavors
dont
live
up
to
the
aroma
dark
golden
cloudy
color
with
a
pure
white
head
smells
like
belgian
spices
and
slightly
floral
with
a
hint
of
funk
taste
is
of
pleasant
spices
as
well
and
somewhat
grassy
light
bodied
this
is
a
tasty
brew
nothing
tremendously
special
but
a
solid
nice
tasting
brew
that
would
almost
be
a
session
brew
if
it
had
a
slightly
lower
abv
d
love
this
beer
i
have
yet
had
a
saison
that
wow
me
but
this
did
it
wish
i
could
get
more
of
these
very
easy
to
drink
a
shout
out
thanks
to
6daysbottomocean
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
great
drinkability
and
fairly
unique
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
my
next
brew
will
be
a
hedgerow
bitter
md
a
smooth
drinking
beer
very
well
carbonated
reallly
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
will
probably
get
another
d
very
good
and
it
livens
up
even
more
as
it
warms
a
very
complex
and
interesting
saison
d
drinks
so
nicely
md
the
finish
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
but
the
aftertaste
if
pleasant
it
is
missing
the
complexity
found
in
belgian
saisons
id
probably
have
it
again
overall
a
very
verygood
saison
so
easy
to
drink
pretty
things
is
a
very
nice
brewery
that
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers

this
just
might
be
my
favorite
beer
drinkability
really
dig
this
brewski
its
got
a
great
hoppydirty
start
that
is
really
unique
for
a
saison
the
finish
is
interesting
with
a
touch
of
caramel
but
i
wish
the
beer
was
slightly
less
cloying
in
the
finish
its
not
a
deal
breaker
obviously
but
its
just
a
touch
more
than
i
like
thanks
much

paquette
already
has
some
new
beers
in
the
works
but
tells
us
that
the
next
is
going
to
be
the
sort
of
beer
i
wanted
to
make
in
yorkshirean
old
alestingo
slang
for
strong
type
in
both
bottle
and
keg
itll
be
named
after
and
dedicated
to
the
great
beer
city
of
boston
called
saint
botolphs
town
um
would
it
be
overkill
if
we
said
interesting
again
had
another
batch
and
its
seems
this
beers
inconsistencies
give
it
a
bit
of
character
but
with
that
said
this
is
my
nyc
go
to
beer
that
is
if
i
can
find
it
i
have
had
some
that
are
no
the
brink
of
going
bad
or
just
a
hint
of
banana
and
others
with
a
broad
palate
range
of
floral
wonder
and
farmhouse
straw
a
good
citrus
with
lemon
zest
sometimes
hints
of
candied
pineapple
and
passionfruit
that
malt
is
light
drinking
but
its
a
lean
beer
has
a
good
feel
to
it
but
that
seems
to
be
the
most
inconsistent
quality
when
at
its
best
a
nice
pollen
and
twig
i
would
imagine
once
this
beer
is
brewed
regularly
and
i
mean
in
the
same
condition
and
the
same
brewery
an
interesting
saison
with
flavors
of
bitter
granny
smith
apples
black
pepper
bite
and
juicy
pears
tart
citrus
blends
too
perhaps
some
tangerines
funky
yeast
assertive
hop
snap
on
the
finish
gets
a
tad
better
with
each
distinctive
sip
d
incredibly
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
saisons
i
have
ever
had
i
was
curious
so
i
checked
the
pretty
things
site
and
there
are
no
spices
in
this
crazy
overall
a
really
nice
and
balanced
saison
the
sweet
bitter
and
rustic
flavors
work
nicely
together
to
create
a
solid
flavor
profile
another
solid
offering
from
pretty
things
so
far
ive
been
really
impressed
by
their

had

a

i
am

to
see
this

d
after

settle

really
come

make
a

d
im
not
sure
if
it
was
the
combo
of
beers
befor
it
or
batch
variability
but
when
i
had
this
a
couple
days
ago
at
a
tasting
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
more
then
i
remember
it
had
a
lot
more
fruitiness
going
on
anyway
this
is
decent
brew
but
just
not
spectacular
in
any
way
drinkability
is
right
up
there
nothing
you
can
really
keep

three
cheers
for
breweries
who
list
bottling
dates
and
three
cheers
to
me
for
not
passing
it
up
despite
that
this
thing
is
nothing
but
vibrant
right
now
and
im
relieved
about
that
perfect

quality
summer
quaffing
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
finishes
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
there
is
some
decent
sweetness
on
the
front
and
mid
palates
there
is
this
dryness
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
that
i
find
very
interesting
there
is
almost
a
fruit
like
character
in
the
late
forward
palate
the
beer
finishes
with
a
mild
graininess
and
some
really
nice
feeling
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
unfortunately
aromaed
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
however
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
bit
too
hoppy
and
not
enough
yeast
character
for
me
but
still
a
solid
beer
for
a
saison
americain
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
just
good
beer
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
especially
if
you
like
the
mildly
sour
beers
enjoyable
to
drink
this
is
a
solid
saison
but
right
now
its
really
not
knocking
my
socks
off
the
carbonation
is
good
and
im
really
digging
how
light
this
is
right
now
the
only
thing
is
im
not
crazy
about
how
dry
this
is
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
that
ill
definitely
have
again
very
refreshing
d
this
could
be
a
good
beer
but
the
lemon
character
needs
to
be
dialed
back
drinkability
was
impressive
this
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
and
packed
with
flavor
while
it
may
not
finish
as
crisp
or
as
dry
as
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
it
is
definitely
more
interesting
than
many
of
them
overall
seems
like
a
good
saison
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
in

pretty

very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
all
the
standard

nose
was
nice
solid
balance
throughout
the
body
was
just
slightly
lacking
for
me
but
still
a
very
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white

not
much

or

aroma
is

but
of

taste
starts
off
with
a
nice
kick
of

zest
and
a
strong
wheat
rush
also
a
bit
of
orange
strong
yeast
profile
ends
with
a
little
bit
of

and
a
kick
of

out

warmed
the

a
really
nice

with

really
has
a
glowing

to
it

is
very

with
some
belgian
herbal
yeast
characteristics
to
it
also
has
a
sweet
sugary

taste
is
spot
on
for

that
nice
crispness
with
a
touch
of
balancing
hops
nice

lightness
to
it
that
makes
it
ultra
crisp
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
is
packed
with
layers
of
flavors
drinkability
is
high
too
because
its
really
refreshing
and
has
that
lemon
earthiness
to
it
that
makes
it
delicious
drinkability
is
okay
the
high
carbonation
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
beer
for
my
first
farmhouse
ale
i
was
hoping
for
an
overwhelming
barnmust
flavor
but
was
surprised
with
this
mild
and
accesible
brew
taste
does
not
disappoint
flavors
of
dry
pear
slight
bitter
lemon
zest
and
bready
malt
it
has
a
light
body
with
a
prickly
level
of
carbonation
minorly
bitter
slightly
drying
finish
the
bitterness
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
a
drying
quality
that
urges
you
to
take
another
sip
as
it
warms
more
sulfur
twang
comes
forward
and
it
becomes
increasingly
drying
with
the
alcohol
becoming
more
prominent
overall
pretty
good
da
most
impressive
brew
that
ranks
up
there
with
some
of
my
most
favorite
saisons
a
subtlety
complex
and
very
interesting
beer
that
is
a
sheer
joy
to
drink
o
should
try
a
fresher
bottle
i
expected
more
but
it
is
decent
good
hop
good
yeast
just
wish
both
were
stronger
aroma
is
very
good
but
doesnt
last
very
drinkable
d
i
can
finish
a
bomber
on
my
own
no
problems
really
tasty
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
i
think
twice
about
8
50
bombers
but
id
pick
this
up
once
in
a
while
drinkability
is
very
good
very
tasty
taste
has
quite
a
bit
of
lemon
peel
flavors
tart
and
bitter
a
little
much
for
me
hint
of
sourness
along
with
the
lemon
offset
the
grainy
sweet
malts
pretty
nicely
though
yeasty
saison
esters
could
be
a
little
stronger
and
more
prevalent
more
funk
please
still
pretty
tasty
for
an
american
brewed

quite
drinkable
and
perfect

ale
it
certainly
is
one
of
my
recent
favorites
while
taking
a
few
stylistic
liberties
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
everything
ive
sampled
from
pretty
things
so
far
complex
with
a
wide
range
of
flavors
a
slightly
less
astringent
finish
would
increase
drinkability
and
slightly
lower
level
of
bitterness
on
the
long
finish
would
make
this
beer
a
balanced
knockout
pours

piled

quite
refreshing

m
d
very
good

very
drinkable
d
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
like
the
idea
of
adding
some
extra
hops
to
a
belgian
saison
but
in
execution
it
wasnt
so
great
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
saison
but
the
hops
and
spice
dominated
the
taste
a
little
too
much
for
me
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
another
highly
impressive
brew
from
pretty
things
im
torn
over
this
certainly
flavourful
enough
but
it
seems
the
stretch
the
style
a
bit
little
too
much
sourness
for
me
and
the
malt
isnt
quite
as
light
as
i
wouldve
liked
worth
a
try
an
interesting
beer
indeed
but
drinkability
is
only
so
so
i
reccomend
giving
it
a
try
but
i
personally
wont
be
adding
this
to
the
list
of
stock
saisons
i
keep
around
d

this
is
a
great

could

do
a

refreshing

an

i
found

unlike
many

ales
ive
had
an
interesting
and
pleasant
mesh
of
flavors
tasty
and
balanced
and
way
too
drinkable
for
the
complexity
and
abv
definitely
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
if
i
get
the
chance
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
would
recommend
this
to
those
who
want
a
tangy
grainy
open
and
a
mildy
hoppy
finish
d
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
here
this
is
good
but
the
flavors
are
all
so
toned
down
that
nothing
stands
out
balanced
for
sure
but
also
a
little
boring
md
medium
bodied
dry
mouthfeel
throughout
a
drinkable
saison
layered
and
complex
enough
to
keep
you
guessing
got
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
grade
trade
with
jlindros
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
nice
12
inch
white
head
that
left
some
very
nice
lacing
on
my
nb
globe
aroma
is
of
some
light
tropical
fruit
pale
malts
and
a
touch
of
belgianlike
yeast
flavor
is
nice
and
fruity
but
not
sweet
very
dry
flavor
of
orange
lemon
some
grassiness
and
lightly
toasty
malts
very
nice
not
overly
complex
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
dry
and
crisp
ample
carbonation
a
nice
beer
and
would
to
have
some
more
from
pretty
things
in
the
future
great
to
start
the
night
off
with
a
bottle
of
jack
this
bottle
comes
from
batch
5
which
was
brewed
back
in
may
color
is
a
beautiful
hazed
golden
color
matched
with
a
large
white
heading
that
has
some
staying
power
the
champagne
yeast
is
evident
in
the
nose
along
with
some
fresh
grains
and
mango
a
whole
array
of
tropical
fruits
hit
the
palate
think
pineapple
guava
etc
first
followed
by
some
peppery
notes
hops
intermingle
with
the
champagne
yeast
to
give
this
beer
is
nice
dryness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
prickly
and
really
complex
drinking
this
by
itself
is
great
but
pairing
it
with
food
is
a
sheer
delight
since
this
beer
has
been
released
it
has
been
a
go
to
for
me
and
remains
my
favorite
from
the
pretty
things
line
some
have
complained
that
the
quality
of
the
newer
batches
has
declined
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
havent
noticed
much
of
a
difference
this
is
one
of
massachusetts
special
treats
to
the
world
of
craftl
beer
cheers
if
not
for
the
presence
of
a
certain
earthiness
i
might
mistake
this
for
a
belgian
ipa
it
lacks
the
complexity
or
tartness
of
many
saisons
but
is
a
proudly
americanized
take
on
the
style
if
this
one
were
regularly
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
i
can
see
it
growing
on
me
in
which
case
i
might
throw
another
half
point
on
top
of
the
taste
rating
d
once
you
get
past
the
initial
bite
of
this
beer
it
is
actually
very
tasty
and
drinkable
i
think
that
this
is
a
beer
for
those
with
the
proper
palate
that
is
to
say
i
dont
think
that
this
is
the
beer
for
everyone
and
while
quite
enjoyable
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
multiple
rounds
of
it
grows
on
you
i
enjoyed
the
spice
that
emerged
deep
into
the
glassand
the
tasts
overal
resembled
that
of
an
amber
alebelgian
blend
very
easy
to
drink
pours
a
cloudy
orange
gold
color
with
a
two
finger
white
fluffy
head
with
solid
retention
leaving
patchy
lacing
down
the
glass
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
mostly
orange
with
floral
notes
and
some
bubblegum
aroma
upfront
the
taste
is
of
orange
and
corriander
like
a
belgian
wit
which
gives
way
to
pear
and
vanilla
then
comes
lemon
hop
and
pepper
spiciness
well
carbonated
with
a
really
nice
dry
finish
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
only
regret
i
didnt
pick
up
some
bleu
cheese
to
pair
with
this
great
saison
ill
have
to
try
that
next
time
because
there
will
definitely
be
a
next
time
d
i
admit
that
i
bought
this
because
i
like
the
label
i
was
rewarded
with
a
very
nice
sasion
perfect
for
this
warm
fall
evening
overall
this
was
another
great
beer
from
pt
the
flavors
worked
well
together
and
the
lingering
bitterness
added
a
nice
element
to
the
beer
this
is
a
really
good
warm
weather
beer
highly
recommended
d
goes
down
smoothly
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
make
me
want
to
quaff
this
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
well
but
kicks
up
the
hops
a
notch
with
notes
of
floral
greenery
light
citrus
zest
and
freshcut
grasses
that
leave
a
light
lingering
bitterness
superb
balance
of
biscuity
malts
with
a
hint
of
honey
mouthfeel
is
equally
as
impressive
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
a
crisp
tight
carbonation
level
that
drinks
smoothly
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
could
easily
handle
an
entire
bomber
of
this
stuff
by
myself
but
was
glad
to
share
it
with
a
friend
impressive
stuff
funky
seasalty
and
bright
on
the
front
of
the
mouth
lemon
dry
grains
this
beer
is
bold
overpowering
mild
food
pairings
this
big
taste
is
abutted
by
plenty
of
velvety
carbonation
to
keep
the
beer
honest
and
quick
zest
is
apt
to
describe
this
the
citric
quality
grows
into
a
metallic
spine
then
opens
into
something
more
complex
the
beer
is
clean
in
the
mouth
light
to
medium
in
body
it
finishes
with
a
slight
caramel
creaminesss
that
is
overrun
by
plenty
of
bitter
hoppiness
and
yeasty
funk
the
hop
lingers
in
the
jowls
below
my
tongue
fitting
zest
is
still
apt
and
i
am
pleased
one
of
the
better
farmhouse
beers
ive
tried
in
some
time
be
forewarned
though
best
to
drink
at
a
reasonable
pace
we
let
the
beer
sit
for
too
long
1hr
or
so
at
least
and
it
became
hot
corny
and
a
bit
messy
notes
not
quite
comparable
to
belgian
saisons
but
a
nice
american
version
a
very
good
beer
to
try
pours
a
translucent
light
goldenorange
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
sticky
dots
of
lacing
and
a
retentive
film
of
tiny
bubbles
spicey
pepper
and
yeasty
nose
very
earthy
slightly
bitter
very
earthy
floral
spicy
body
with
a
strong
malt
body
however
that
malt
never
really
asserts
and
sweetness
throughout
medium
body
with
very
full
sharp
carbonation
subtle
citrus
flavors
more
rind
tartness
than
sweet
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
well
balanced
and
subtle
flavors
not
my
favorite
saison
and
a
little
too
expensive
for
me
to
seek
out
again
but
would
recommend
i
had
the
jack
dor
first
followed
by
both
the
confounded
mister
sisyphus
an
earthy
golden
ale
thats
a
little
strong
on
the
cherry
flavors
and
baby
tree
a
brown
malty
complex
quad
with
strong
notes
of
plum
both
from
pretty
things
as
well
the
jack
dor
was
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
three
and
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
it
when
i
next
return
to
the
new
england
area
i
think
the
phenols
could
give
this
beer
some
more
character
with
age
but
for
now
it
just
reminds
me
of
sanitizing
with
bleach
which
has
been
sort
of
a
hard
memory
to
erase
after
a
couple
years
of
bad
homebrewing
overall
a
cool
beer
interested
in
looking
it
up
again
in
ba
mag
and
seeing
whats
in
it
d
a
very
highly
drinkable
saison
i
was
willing
to
wait
to
pop
it
and
was
pleased
that
it
lived
up
to
the
first
experience
over
a
month
ago
one
of
the
best
i
have
drank
lately
it
fits
the
summer
humidity
with
its
drinkability
i
will
seek
this
out
again
most
certainly
overall
pretty
great
highly
recommend
very
refreshing
very
tasty
muted
fruit
and
honey
tones
great
for
the
summer
wouldnt
stand
up
to
a
lot
of
food
but
something
light
like
cheese
and
fruit
would
be
delicious
or
just
sip
on
its
own
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
smooth
white
head
leaving
tons
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mighty
tasty
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
lot
of
yeastiness
the
taste
gives
a
nice
citrusy
sweetness
up
front
and
nice
amount
of
the
farmhouse
yeastiness
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
tart
dry
finish
the
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
make
this
a
good
drinkable
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
fine
pale
malt
scent
along
with
an
earthyfruity
yeast
aroma
it
has
a
mild
hop
character
that
really
compliments
the
esters
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
very
citrousy
flavor
that
screams
esters
from
the
yeast
also
the
hops
add
a
solid
bitterness
as
well
its
quite
earthy
with
tons
of
farmhouse
funk
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
beer
with
lots
of
unique
character
a
fine
farmhouse
ale
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
dry
and
creamy
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
on
this
warm
summer
evening
starts
sweets
and
clean
some
bready
flavor
comes
in
afterward
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
this
bitter
aftertaste
maybe
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
from
a
saison
but
i
guess
the
american
saison
description
covers
this
drinkable
yes
but
im
not
sure
its
my
type
for
this
style
i
can
recognize
it
is
a
good
beer
just
not
my
taste
this
beer
for
me
has
all
day
drinkability
another
fantastic
summer
beer
just
a
refreshingly
clean
well
hopped
saison
d
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
safe
side
as
far
as
saisons
go
yeah
kind
odd
saying
that
with
all
the
hops
in
it
but
the
funkfarmhouse
flavors
just
arent
hitting
home
notes
from
and
tasted
on
73009
a
really
interesting
take
on
a
saison
i
finished
the
bomber
extremely
easy
and
would
have
been
ready
for
more
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
brew
i
hope
the
others
from
the
brewer
stack
up
as
nice
a
golden
amber
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
some
cloudiness
it
smelled
of
funk
and
candied
sugar
lots
of
earthiness
and
lemon
tart
followed
by
some
caramel
notes
a
bit
of
acidity
and
dryness
in
the
finish
i
easily
finished
the
bomber
and
had
room
to
spare
personally
i
would
say
that
the
addition
of
hops
has
made
this
beer
more
drinkable
than
certain
traditional
saisons
although
i
can
definitely
put
back
a
few
hennepins
the
acidity
often
causes
me
to
limit
my
consumption
this
enterprising
addition
has
not
only
made
this
beer
standout
but
much
easier
to
consume
and
enjoy
d
wow
this
beer
is
unbelievable
cant
stop
sipping
this
this
is
a
real
surprise
from
the
handful
of
saisons
i
have
tried
i
have
not
been
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
beer
has
converted
me
mark
my
words
pretty
things
beers
are
going
to
be
some
of
the
most
sought
after
beers
very
soon
gadzooks
this
is
dry
i
can
feel
it
sucking
the
moisture
out
of
my
body
its
like
a
yeast
infection
in
a
bottle
egads
d
very
good
not
offending
at
all
and
pretty
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
offerings
i
also
love
the
fact
that
dan
used
to
brew
beer
at
the
north
east
brewing
company
which
was
my
home
away
from
my
allston
apartment
from
19961999
or
so
if
this
is
a
true
rep
of
the
style
its
amazing
the
saison
didnt
die
centuries
ago
ive
had
much
better
saisons
this
one
is
ok
bordering
on
actively
unpleasant
pours
a
hazy
straw
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
has
banana
spices
peppery
yeast
and
citrus
flavor
is
also
on
the
fruity
side
with
an
earthy
herbal
yeast
presence
crisp
body
is
well
carbonated
tasty
saison
great
with
funky
cheese
and
fresh
fruits
or
a
seafood
dish
draft
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
thick
white
head
aroma
of
wheat
and
yeast
very
delicious
flavor
is
bready
with
light
fruits
and
spices
in
the
finish
well
balanced
just
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
very
similar
on
draft
compared
to
the
bottle
version
d
the
6
4
is
low
and
not
present
in
the
taste
at
all
so
this
one
is
a
easy
one
to
tackle
while
i
could
down
a
whole
bottle
of
this
i
would
rather
share
it
the
freshness
of
the
bottle
really
sows
the
array
of
flavors
in
this
a
great
treat
during
the
summer
a
good
saison
good
american
interpretation
much
larger
hop
presence
than
traditional
belgians
but
very
nice
d
i
think
acbf
was
their
coming
out
party
and
it
did
make
me
pick
up
some
of
their
beer
the
brewers
are
super
nice
and
their
beers
are
really
quite
good
the
artwork
is
solid
and
distinctive
they
have
a
ton
of
potential
this
is
an
extremely
wellmade
saison
and
one
that
id
consider
having
again
for
sure
more
than
anything
though
it
makes
me
want
to
try
all
the
other
pretty
things
brews
definitely
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
heavy
carbonation
d
fine
saison
with
plenty
of
spicy
peppery
goodness
and
strong
yeast
presence
i
am
beginning
to
like
this
style
more
and
more
lately
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
split
a
bottle
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
this
was
a
wellcrafte
and
mighty
tasty
beer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
hennepin
for
the
dry
hoppy
flavor
this
beer
had
an
obvious
sweet
candy
malt
undercurrent
with
light
belgian
spice
but
this
is
a
delicously
hoppy
belgian
dry
and
drinkable
just
like
the
style
dictates
with
herbal
peppery
and
citrus
hops
all
over
your
tongue
good
beer
go
find
it
this
is
one
to
buy
again
and
again
and
share
and
promote
i
feel
like
im
getting
in
on
the
ground
floor
of
something
with
huge
potential
the
feel
is
bubbly
like
champagne
lots
of
fizz
appropriate
for
style
but
a
little
sharp
its
not
stellar
because
its
so
sharp
and
so
fizzy
but
its
drinkable
for
a
saison
citrus
chlorine
and
a
belgian
funk
spice
although
i
am
drinking
this
by
itself
i
can
imagine
it
would
be
great
with
food
production
is
getting
increased
hooray
beer
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
a
very
nice
large
4
finger
head
which
leaves
some
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
standard
for
the
style
lemon
spices
and
earth
tones
are
light
but
evident
taste
is
lighter
and
hides
some
of
the
earthy
tones
i
really
love
from
most
saisons
but
still
very
good
none
the
less
the
mouthfeel
is
crsp
and
drinkability
is
also
very
good
i
like
what
they
are
trying
to
do
and
plan
on
trying
more
beers
from
pretty
things
very
solid
effort
and
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
by
an
up
and
coming
brewery
ive
met
dann
the
brewguy
at
a
tasting
and
he
and
martha
seem
like
absolutely
wonderful
folks
definitely
the
local
brewers
you
want
to
support
jack
dor
is
a
wonderful
summer
beer
great
for
beating
the
heat
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
overall
a
nice
and
very
interesting
saison
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
strong
pale
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
no
matter
what
it
is
its
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
love
to
see
at
a
selection
of
nice
restaurants
in
nyc
alongside
its
brother
st

seems
like
a
fantastic

pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
head
that
is
a
thin
ring
fairly
light
aromas
of
lemon
coriander
and
white
pepper
good
flavor
with
some
nice
herbal
character
lemon
and
a
very
light
spiciness
a
bit
spritzy
in
the
mouth
but
acceptable
for
the
style
pretty
pleasant
beer
if
perhaps
a
little
simple
still
this
is
a
nice
spring
beer
hv
pours
a
foggy
gold
corn
hue
with
a
full
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
some
chunky
lacing
here
and
there
holds
on
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
throughout
the
aroma
consists
of
spice
banana
and
belgian
yeast
a
good
dose
of
floral
hops
and
pear
an
enjoyable
nose
light
and
fresh
taste
starts
off
with
light
fruits
white
grapes
green
apple
and
pear
midway
the
dry
hops
emerge
which
clearly
help
identify
this
beer
as
an
american
saison
the
spices
linger
in
the
aftertaste
with
coriander
and
dry
grass
soft
and
pillowy
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
strong
sting
from
the
carbonation
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
i
pounded
this
beer
my
first
from
this
breweryproject
but
i
picked
up
the
baby
tree
as
well
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
im
guessing
kiernan
brought
these
bad
boys
to
the
cuse
please
get
more
here
the
second
pouring
is
as
nice
looking
as
the
first
the
flavors
are
coming
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
with
more
floral
flavor
this
is
a
great
massachusetts
beer
overall
this
was
a
better
than
average
tasting
saison
there
is
a
nice
tolerable
booze
level
to
it
and
i
like
the
fact
that
another
american
craft
brewer
besides
clipper
city
is
brewing
one
cheers
overall
solid
good
but
not
great
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
though
i
really
do
not
feel
the
need
to
seek
it
out
again
still
though
no
bad
its
nice
to
have
pretty
things
in
the
philly
area
now
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beer
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while

final
thoughts
i
was
so
happy
to
try
this
brew
definite
surpise
at
a
tasting
and
i
had
to
get
more
next
time
i
visit
the
store
i
would
definitely
try
another
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
new
project
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
as
this
is
a
solid
effort
enjoyed
on
tap
at
a
recent
beer
dinner
at
vee
vee
had
the
bottled
version
a
few
times
which
excellent
as
well
overall
this
is
a
very
light
saison
thats
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
certainly
worth
a
shot
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
golden
honey
with
a
huge
rocky
3inch
white
head
that
leaves
some
superb
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
white
pepper
coriander
apricots
and
a
bit
of
mustiness
all
come
together
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
biscuity
up
front
toast
and
yeast
a
bit
of
orange
rind
and
a
subtle
mustiness
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
dry
as
most
saisons
but
it
does
have
a
sharp
carbonation
that
allows
the
flavor
to
cut
across
he
palate
this
is
a
very
good
saison
especially
for
a
new
brewery
im
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
all
in
all
good
stuff
not
in
the
upper
echelon
of
saisons
but
really
tasty
i
would
love
to
have
again
this
is
a
decent
saison
but
not
the
revelation
others
have
been
the
harshness
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
a
dealbreaker
for
me
d
im
glad
that
i
traded
for
two
bottles
this
seems
like
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
want
to
drink
fresh
so
that
the
hops
dont
lose
their
appeal
well
drink
up
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
drink
three
bombers
of
this
and
call
it
a
session
easy
were
i
able
to
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
id
buy
it
by
the
case
take
de
ranke
xx
mix
it
with
some
saison
dupont
and
then
finally
add
the
perfect
mixture
of
american
hops
and
bam
jack
dor
really
an
amazingly
well
balanced
beer
perfect
combo
of
funk
and
flavor
good
stuff
d
in
terms
of
earlyspring
beers
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
there
are
so
many
flavors
here
so
each
sip
is
different
and
exciting
great
job

ommegang

but
still
is
as
refreshing
and
drinkable
as
can
be
like
the

the
mild

and
the
creeping
sweetness
would
have
this
again
just
feels
right
to
drink
here
at
the
start
of
spring
had
on
tap
at
tph
last
night
although
it
wasnt
on
the
menu
incredibly
hazy
from
yeast
with
a
lively
full
head
immense
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
was
of
yeast
and
lots
of
hops
wonderful
taste
was
classic
saison
dry
and
sharp
with
depp
complex
flavors
from
around
the
farm
mouthfeel
was
also
exceptional
completly
surrounding
the
mouth
and
tongue
drinkability
is
high
as
this
is
sooo
delicious
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
the
saison
style
this
is
a
very
solid
saison
quite
enjoyable
its
not
the
most
complex
one
youll
ever
find
but
its
well
crafted
and
quite
tasty
definitely
worth
picking
up
d
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
saisonstyle
a
highly
drinkable
blend
of
belgian
and
american
characters
this
is
an
easytoconsume
brew
good
but
quite
a
bit
leass
yeasty
than
most
saisons
ive
had
drinkability
is
very
good
for
such
a
strong
beer
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
saisons
ive
ever
had
that
also
maintains
a
lot
of
good
tastes
in
it
go
find
this
one
and
drink
it
on
any
occassion
very
tasty
not
in
your
face
at
all
but
subtlety
complex
all
over
which
adds
to
its
great
drinkablity
has
a
orange
cloudy
look
plenty
of
yeast
suspended
in
the
glass
my
favorite
and
pours
with
a
light
head
that
lasted
for
a
surprisingly
short
period
given
what
ive
seen
in
others
in
this
style
hoppy
aroma
of
citrus
and
peaches
definitely
some
grapefruit
from
the
smell
i
expected
more
hops
in
the
taste
but
was
happy
to
note
more
malt
than
hops
nonetheless
it
had
a
bitter
tilt
that
added
some
spice
bananas
in
the
background
both
in
aroma
and
taste
lightly
carbonated
overall
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
compared
to
other
saisons
like
hennepin
and
saison
dupont
this
is
rather
a
lightweight
but
all
in
all
rather
refreshing
and
worth
a
second
try
briefly
starts
as
a
malty
beverage
but
this
is
completely
overwhelmed
by
a
very
strong
raw
hop
flavor
this
taste
lasts
through
the
swallow
and
long
into
the
aftertaste
the
only
negative
i
feel
is
the
body
which
is
surprisingly
thin
given
the
aroma
and
flavor
profile
the
carbonation
is
spritzy
which
doesnt
mitigate
the
mouthfeel
overall
the
beer
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
this
is
a
boring
beer
really
wish
the
rest
of
the
bottle
was
hennepin
or
something
like
that
saisons
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
is
very
nice
excellent
smooth
mouthfeel
belgianesque
in
the
taste
sweet
malts
with
little
to
no
hop
in
the
mix
finishes
with
a
slight
tartnesss
that
that
is
felt
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
light
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one
thanks
to
ba
dmamiano
feel
is
solid
for
the
style
carbonation
keeps
it
refreshing
even
while
flavorful
d
im
not
huge
until
most
belgian
stuff
but
i
really
dig
this
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
pleasing
yes
sir
ill
have
another
after
having
this
one
i
was
wishing
that
i
had
picked
up
more
d
notes
this
is
a
great
bow
for
the
pretty
things
project
highly
highly
drinkablesessionable
earthy
character
really
comes
out
and
i
think
it
really
defines
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
some
really
cool
snowflake
lacing
herbal
citrus
hops
and
lemons
dominate
aroma
while
more
spices
emerge
in
flavor
a
elite
session

sticks
around
forever

a

i
liked
it
edit
21309
i
had
some
more
small
samples
at
a
tasting
with
mr
paquette
himself
with
his
explanation
of
what
he
was
trying
to
achieve
with
the
beer
i
realize
i
had
to
think
out
of
the
box
for
this
a
little
more
ill
bump
up
a
half
point
each
for
taste
and
drinkability
it
was
certainly
very
quaffable
especially
this
second
time
around
pours
bright
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
it
has
a
pleasant
spicy
citrus
nose
with
some
belgiany
esters
the
taste
is
very
lemony
some
malt
sweetness
and
nicely
balanced
by
spicy
hops
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
in
mouthfeel
the
beer
finishes
smooth
and
clean
and
is
very
drinkable

into

glass
huge
head
formed
and
it
just
lingered
there
like
a
snow
cap
hazy
golden
orange
color
lots
of
lacing
present
smell
was
a
bit
citruslike
with
some
spice
and
hops
also
taste
was
excellent
had
a
belgian
sugary
sweetness
to
it
but
it
also
had
a
bit
of
lemon
flavor
that
lent
a
nice
counterbalance
to
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
since
i
had
this
on
a
cold
january
night
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
for
a
warm
evening
this
summer
a
great
introduction
for
this
new
brewing
company
i
e
project
great
job
pretty
things
quite
a
nice
debut
by
pretty
things
i
look
forward
to
more
d
very
good
the
drinkability
is
good
its
got
a
lot
of
complexity
but
maintains
a
subtle
profile
very
very
nice
i
hope
to
see
more
of
this
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
tart
more
acerbic
and
slightly
less
sweet
than
i
would
have
anticipated
from
the
nose
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
not
sweet
because
it
is
this
is
a
very
characteristic
saison
beer
with
lots
of
carbonation
champagne
like
yeasty
fizz
lots
of
apple
and
rind
in
the
taste
the
beer
has
some
orange
notes
some
spices
in
the
coriander
family
and
a
peppery
spice
and
bite
in
the
finish
this
is
a
refreshing
fizzy
beer
with
a
bit
of
an
abv
burn
in
the
mouth
to
let
you
know
that
this
isnt
a
light
summer
ale
overall
excellent
brew
everything
about
this
beer
screams
quality
the
malt
is
sticky
but
not
nearly
overbearing
the
hops
are
fresh
and
delicious
providing
a
wonderful
compliment
to
the
crisp
saison
tang
a
refreshing
beverage
to
say
the
least
and
an
amazing
first
offering
from
pretty
things
and
dann
paquette
if
this
beer
was
white
wine
it
would
easily
fetch
upwards
of
100
a
bottle
yes
its
of
that
caliber
on
a
separate
note
i
want
to
know
where
dann
gets
his
hops
these
are
unreal
pours
a
nice
orange
hazy
body
and
bubbly
white
head
smells
of
fresh
hop
flowers
that
you
just
crushed
between
your
fingers
to
smell
fresh
orange
peel
and
some
citrus
zest
taste
hmmmm
a
bit
bitter
from
the
hops
the
bitterness
dominates
the
pallet
at
first
followed
by
the
smooth
sweet
malt
some
hints
of
fruit
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
spicy
finish
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavors
battling
it
out
maybe
some
age
will
mellow
them
out
and
they
will
play
nicely
although
the
more
i
drink
the
less
i
notice
the
battle
of
flavors
all
in
all
a
hint
more
balance
would
be
nice
again
maybe
aging
mouth
feel
has
lots
of
good
carbonation
that
evaporates
the
beer
on
your
tongue
but
the
beer
has
a
dense
unfiltered
characteristic
that
may
sound
contradictory
but
true
as
for
drinkability
the
first
bottle
is
great
but
its
a
big
beer
heavy
beer
so
full
of
flavor
that
i
would
not
say
its
a
session
beer
overall
a
great
beer
as
the
bottle
says
this
beer
is
an
american
saison
due
to
its
much
more
flavorful
characteristics
from
the
belgian
style
if
the
brewer
does
a
higher
alcohol
version
we
might
have
an
imperial
saison
on
our
hands
now
start
bottling
shaherizad
and
send
it
to
baltimore
poured

doughy
with

notes
taste
is

sweet
citrus
in

and
wisps
of
spices
here
and
there
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
as
well
nice
place
to
start
for
this
project
of
danns
refreshing
its
spicy
and
hoppy
but
balanced
by
a
nice
sweetness
that
doesnt
overpower
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
of
these
this
is
a
great
brew
from
a
great
brewer
and
a
really
nice
guy
i
will
have
this
on
my
shelves
in
my
store
as
well
as
in
my
home
a
very
solid
brew
my
first
review
after
talking
about
starting
for
ages
i
picked
this
bottle
up
at
gordons
liquors
in
waltham
ma
sticker
on
back
says
first
batch
bottled
november
2008
the
beer
is
cloudy
with
a
solid
head
which
settled
down
nicely
very
smooth
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
i
taste
a
hint
of
cloves
lemon
and
tangerine
very
drinkable
and
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
looking
forward
to
more
offerings
from
this
brewer
i
like
this
good
mix
for
a
saisonbelgian
ipa
very
clean
extremely
drinkable
i
flew
through
my
pint
of
this
i
found
this
beer
surprisingly
outstanding
i
love
firestone
walker
ipas
so
im
game
to
try
everything
they
put
out
and
man
i
was
glad
to
stumble
across
this
one
its
tart
and
effervescent
and
completely
refreshing
very
pale
in
the
glass
with
a
tall
head
its
a
thirstquenching
delight
the
head
dissipates
very
quickly
and
the
color
is
almost
as
light
asa
macro
lager
the
smell
is
overpowered
by
white
wine
in
my
opinion
if
i
was
a
fan
of
white
wine
i
think
id
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
there
is
definitely
a
yeasty
smell
and
taste
but
the
beer
is
pretty
thin
compared
to
what
im
used
to
from
firestone
walker
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
definitely
the
feel
very
light
smooth
and
refreshing
almost
effervescent
overall
though
id
go
with
a
different
firestone
walker
selection
if
given
the
choice
cloudy
sour
aroma
tart
finish
but
very
enjoyable
o
this
was
great
nice
and
fresh
and
clean
overall
imagine
a
pale
ale
with
a
moderate
hop
hit
and
a
nice
belgian
sour
kick
very
tasty
this
beer
is
very
chugable
but
buyer
beware
7
5
abv
o
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
by
the
pool
or
on
the
porch
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
pours
a
strawgold
in
color
with
a
billowy
cap
of
foam
theres
a
light
aroma
of
wet
hay
and
a
floral
note
its
crisp
with
some
wet
hay
and
a
floral
note
in
the
finish
at
once
pleasantly
floral
and
lightly
delightfully
funky
with
a
medicinal
finish
ive
tried
it
fresh
within
a
week
of
bottling
and
aged
six
month
bottlenot
intentionally
and
enjoyed
it
both
times
overall
a
good
effort
at
an
american
saison
but
not
a
home
run
for
me
would
gladly
get
again
but
it
isnt
something
i
will
seek
out
very
lite
in
color
nice
head
and
smell
tart
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
but
low
on
tart
taste
medium
straw
hazy
color
smells
of
grass
with
papaya
tropical
fruit
flavors
tasted
bitter
up
front
with
fruit
flavors
coming
through
finishing
up
with
the
hop
body
and
light
carbonation
to
feel
like
it
cleanses
your
mouth
for
the
next
sip
bottle
definitely
tastes
like
a
saison
with
the
distinct
yeast
smell
and
spice
solid
beer
with
lots
of
dry
herbal
hop
and
phenolic
qualities
pours
a
kind
of
dirty
chamomile
color
with
some
haziness
and
a
poplike
head
that
evaporates
to
nothing
dry
fruity
yeast
notes
juicy
apple
spicy
phenols
doughy
white
pepper
very
clean
finish
pretty
substantive
flavoraromawise
with
a
floral
chalky
character
very
good
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
fw
beers
andor
saisons
i
just
wish
i
could
try
it
really
fresh
this
just
didnt
quite
work
for
me
it
wasnt
bad
per
se
it
just
seemed
a
bit
off
to
my
palate
o
overall
very
good
i
would
like
to
do
a
comparison
between
allagash
white
and
this
as
they
are
so
similar
in
style
straw
yellow
with
a
white
foamy
head
spiced
saison
flavors
with
a
faint
hop
undertone
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
wellbalanced
and
interesting
take
on
a
classic
i
would
recommend
it
for
just
about
anyone
due
to
the
great
balance
between
hops
yeast
and
spice
the
only
draw
back
is
that
it
isnt
as
intense
in
flavor
as
it
could
be
or
in
comparison
to
others
in
the
style
additionally
i
have
only
found
it
in
the
750
ml
bottle
i
would
like
to
see
some
12
oz
bottles
i
would
give
this
93100
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
tried
theres
both
citrus
and
citrus
peel
notes
a
bit
different
but
nice
it
puts
me
in
the
mood
of
outdoors
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
nicely
complex
id
easily
have
more
of
this
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
pleasant
from
start
to
finish
like
a
light
blanket
for
spring
this
beer
just
covers
over
the
tongue
with
a
soft
flavorful
pillow
ive
looked
at
this
at
my
local
bars
cooler
for
a
while
figured
it
was
high
time
to
pick
it
up
whilst
catsitting
relatively
far
away
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
brettlike
lemon
zest
and
a
vague
spicy
sweetness
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
now
overlystrong
brettishness
coming
through
as
a
strange
puckering
bitterness
yowza
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
i
just
plain
didnt
like
this
stuff
it
was
all
in
that
strange
brettlike
character
that
ended
up
putting
more
pain
on
my
tongue
than
a
bitesized
hitman
hart
overall
surprising
in
many
ways
as
i
always
think
of
firestone
beers
as
solid
but
underwhelming
this
beer
is
definitely
on
the
extreme
side
of
what
they
make
with
regards
to
complexity
and
what
they
can
do
with
a
beer
probably
more
extreme
than
what
was
originally
brewed
in
wallonia
session
saisons
especially
with
the
alcohol
content
but
still
one
of
the
most
complex
favorite
saisons
my
favorite
style
i
have
ever
had
definitely
an
inspiring
beer
for
someone
who
only
brews
farmhouse
style
i
agree
with
jack
this
one
is
completely
underrated
this
is
a
complex
beast
of
a
beer
combining
traditional
ale
characteristics
with
a
wild
bretty
side
the
pour
is
a
beautiful
straw
color
with
a
thick

feel

near

but
still
a
nice
unique
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
really
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
saison
very
nice
citrus
flavors
balanced
with
a
bready
slightly
sweet
overtone
the
only
thing
keeping
this
beer
from
being
great
or
even
outstanding
is
that
slight
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
domestic
saisons
ive
had
the
complexity
of
the
smell
and
flavor
keep
me
interested
the
mouthfeel
however
is
very
prickly
but
the
finish
is
pretty
great
this
would
probably
be
a
fantastic
beer
from
a
keg
or
aged
for
year
in
a
bottle
ive
been
eager
to
try
this
one
for
quite
sometime
two
fingers
worth
of
big
fizzy
slightly
off
white
colored
comprised
of
big
and
bigger
chunky
bubbles
decent
retention
the
color
is
pale
hazy
lemony
straw
yellow
a
light
to
moderate
bit
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
in
small
streaks
the
aroma
is
led
by
a
big
punch
of
lemon
zest
at
the
forefront
some
hay
and
fresh
cut
grass
some
very
subtle
belgian
yeast
undertones
the
aroma
is
world
class
the
flavor
profile
is
almost
equally
exquisite
the
lemon
zest
is
again
at
the
forefront
there
are
rich
layer
or
grassy
and
earthy
notes
the
faint
belgian
yeast
is
also
quite
noticeable
palate
there
is
a
faint
bit
of
candied
sugars
as
well
the
faintest
hint
of
pepper
on
the
deep
finish
the
end
result
is
a
very
nice
deeply
complex
and
world
class
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
light
bodied
spry
with
loads
of
prickly
carbonation
a
bit
chalky
throughout
color
me
impressed
by
this
offering
this
is
a
top
notch
saison
that
i
would
welcome
in
my
glass
anytime
and
one
that
i
would
also
highly
recommend
another
two
roads
production
this
is
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
in
sum
one
of
the
best
hoppy
saisons
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
the
yeast
and
hops
work
really
wellhop
selection
here
i
think
was
key
as
the
use
of
more
grassy
clean
and
lightly
fruity
hops
play
well
off
the
yeasts
spiciness
a
super
beer
that
is
great
to
see
in
4packs
wow
i
am
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
but
not
familiar
with
the
brewer
but
i
had
heard
good
things
so
i
was
optimistic
bummer
not
a
bad
initial
taste
but
very
off
on
the
finish
a
metallic
taste
that
lingers
with
something
that
was
off
had
a
decent
saison
smell
although
still
something
off
overall
barely
got
over
a
3
from
me
who
is
generally
over
average
and
definitely
for
this
style
maybe
it
just
caught
me
on
a
bad
day
but
for
me
there
was
something
off
that
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
clear
pale
straw
color
a
touch
of
pepper
on
the
nose
with
a
mild
yeastiness
but
no
heavy
funk
like
many
of
this
style
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
flavor
and
a
dry
finish
this
works
but
its
nothing
id
order
again
translucent
golden
brown
with
a
pleasant
foamy
white
head
scent
of
alcohol
and
malts
tastes
is
alcohol
and
fruit
without
being
overly
sweet
with
a
faint
bitter
finish
carbonation
is
pleasant
for
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
delightful
beer
i
feel
this
review
doesnt
quite
capture
its
flavors
very
complex
and
delightful
a
strong
fullflavoured
brew
has
a
quite
unique
earthy
and
peppery
flavour
on
top
of
the
usual
hop
bitterness
on
the
bitter
side
of
the
scale
and
not
for
everyone
but
offers
something
different
to
enjoy
not
the
easiest
drinking
beer
out
and
its
heavier
carbonation
bloats
slightly
however
good
if
youre
not
drinking
many
and
would
pair
up
well
with
a
spicy
vegetable
curry
stir
fry
or
some
grilled
kangaroo
which
has
a
charred
and
grassygamey
taste
to
match
coriander
leads
the
way
on
this
beer
and
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
that
spice
that
being
said
the
body
is
right
the
look
is
great
were
it
not
for
the
coriander
this
would
have
been
a
good
to
very
good
beer
overall
again
i
went
in
giving
it
some
leeway
for
being
old
and
it
still
has
a
good
taste
for
a
hopped
saison
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
discounted

the

funk
and
saison
spice
bitterness
medium

peppery
carbonation
i
really
like
the
flavor
progression
on
this
saison
with
both
dryness
and
light
sweetness
alternating
good
fruit
and
malt
flavors
and
a
just
enough
funk
to
give
it
character
stillwater
was
the
first
brewery
to
turn
me
on
to
the
saison
style
and
this
is
an
example
of
how
they
succeeded
nice

this

some

some

a
bit
of
a

overload
before
coming
to
a
full

with
a
bit
of
a
high

finish
then
dries
out
a
ballsy
full
flavoured

some
of
the
alcohol
comes
through
and
eventually
it
become
apparent
this
is
not
up
to
the
highest
standards
despite
a
full
flavour
pretty
solidly
built
saison
though
lot
of
flavour
and
good
stylistically
perhaps
my
criticisms
were
a
bit
too
harsh
as
its
quite
tasty
good
drinking
tho
o
i
really
liked
this
and
could
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
saisondry
while
remaining
refreshing
great
flavors
throughout
the
experience
drinkability
its

good

aromas

bubblegum

honey
artificial
banana
slight
lemon
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
a
nice
dry
tartness
to
it
with
a
good
malt
backbone
overall
this
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
up
front
and
a
bit
on
the
harsher
side
at
the
end
but
overall
is
a
quite
drinkable
and
appealing
saison
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
overthetop
carbonation
notwithstanding
this
is
one
beautiful
tasty
saison
theres
plenty
of
complexity
to
keep
the
palate
occupied
and
few
beers
look
prettier
sitting
in
the
glass
on
a
hot
day
it
could
probably
benefit
from
a
little
restraint
and
refinement
but
i
like
where
stillwater
was
going
with
this
o
a
very
solid
very
respectable
saison
that
is
nicely
styled
and
confidently
executed
overall
an
above
average
saison
that
has
nice
crisp
bitterness
and
good
dryness
the
smell
and
look
were
excellent
however
worth
a
try
but
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
odelicious
well
represents
the
style
nice
barnyard
fruity
hoppy
very
impressive
i
would
gladly
buy
this
one
again
fantastic
example
of
one
of
my
personal
favorite
styles
this
will
make
a
great
grillin
companion
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
you
definitely
want
to
add

for

definitely
a
keeper
and
kudos
to
the

and
to
twelve
percent
o
well
above

saison
though
not
nearly
an

or
any

overall
a

probably
the
driest

i
have
had
definitely

trying
more

not
quite
up
there
with
my
favorite
domestic
examples
of
the
style
o
unique

together
with
sweet

this
beer
is
not

is
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
oa
decent
beer
which
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot

o
well
above

aroma

i
loved
it
overall
a
great
saison

one
of
the
more

ive
had
given
its

the
pronounced

ive

to
enjoy
a

of
these
overall
bought
off
a
store

recommendation
im
loving
this
brewing
company
it
is
astounding
how
much
respect
i
have
gained
for
this
company
in
the

i
have
tried

extremely
affordable

this

i
will
promptly
be
snagging
everything
that
i
havent

from
this

they
are

good

hint

easy

overall
an
interesting
saison
but
not
something
i
will
purchase
again
othis
is
a
very
solid
saison
i
appreciate
how
drinkable
it
is
while
maintaining
a
complex
flavor
profile
the
floral
flavors
are
not
overly
perfumed
and
there
is
just
a
bit
of
spicy
grassy
bitterness
to
keep
things
from
getting
gummy
and
sweet
if
i
were
to
pick
nits
i
wonder
how
this
brew
would
be
at
about
5
5
abv
so
it
is
more
of
a
table
beer
maybe
it
would
lose
some
of
the
complexity
but
as
is
it
is
a
solid
beer
a
real
nice
light
saison
wheat
malt
driven
with
a
great
yeast
strain
happening
pours
real
cloudy
and
pale
light
orange
with
a
dying
off
white
head
and
good
lace
i
smell
grazing
cattle
and
white
wheat
in
equal
proportion
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
some
real
creative
stuff
here
too
almost
a
belgian
triple
with
candy
sugar
and
spunky
yeast
i
taste
wheat
malt
on
the
lighter
side
and
a
flocculated
yeast
that
just
adds
tannic
funk
and
coagulated
protein
density
to
a
beer
that
should
be
real
delicate
otherwise
not
a
brewers
error
but
a
critique
nevertheless
great
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
that
would
be
heavy
if
it
didnt
work
so
damn
well
overall
a
great
first
beer
from
this
crew
and
something
i
am
real
eager
to
get
back
into
special
stuff
and
being
american
made
makes
it
epic
compared
to
its
peers
worth
your
hard
earned
shrappy
overall
very
drinkable
and
enough
flavour
to
keep
you
interested
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
be
buying
more
the
next
time
i
see
it
i
also
really
like
the
smaller
format
in
4
packs
pours
a
slightly
firey
golden
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
spicey
some
ripe
banana
pepper
atouch
of
lemon
and
grassy
flavor
is
spicey
lemon
a
touch
of
toasted
bread
pepper
and
a
touch
of
some
earthy
hops
again
a
little
alcohol
comes
through
which
detracts
just
a
little
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
solid
saison
that
i
am
really
happy
to
see
in
colorado
one
i
will
buy
again
poured
an
orangelike
gold
with
decent
head
and
lace
and
a
funky
aroma
some
spice
and
citric
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
yeast
but
not
much
else
in
the
fruit
department
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
a
smooth
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
passes
my
tongue
with
moderate
spiciness
citric
hop
and
lighttropical
fruit
flavors
not
much
sweetness
but
beer
is
lively
with
lots
of
carbonation
i
enjoyed
this
beer
consider
it
a
simple
saison
that
complements
a
warm
day
overall
a
saison
verging
on
a
dubbel
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
complexity
the
more
you
contemplate
it
the
more
it
surprises
you
opretty
solid
and
straightforward
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
some
other
stuff
from
stillwater
but
still
very
enjoyable
o
very
nice
saison
with
a
ton
of
spice
it
is
well
balanced
nick
was
nice
enough
to
send
it
my
way
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
the
perfume
flavor
is
really
distracting
i
really
loved
this
beer
as
a
base
beer
that
is
put
into
barrels
i
have
tried
the
stateside
saison
that
was
aged
in
chardonnay
barrels
and
that
beer
was
awesome
o
not
going
on
my
must
have
again
but
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
either
little
too
tart
up
front
but
that
fades
quickly
into
a
fine
beer
im
admittedly
no
expert
on
saisons
and
have
only
tried
a
few
but
this
one
does
nothing
to
make
me
want
to
delve
further
into
the
style
its
drinkable
enough
but
the
funky
spicyness
just
isnt
for
me
i
prefer
the
others
ive
tried
like
jailhouses
reprieve
or
even
the
ovila
with
mandarins
im
a
huge
saison
fan
and
this
was
a
decent
one
o
another
great
new
world
hopped
farmhouse
edges
out
tank
7
for
me
by
a
nose
statesides
citrus
forward
hop
profile
just
really
pairs
well
with
their
yeast
strain
o
saisons
can
be
hit
or
miss
for
me
id
classify
this
one
as
a
hit
nothing
exceptional
but
good
nonetheless
cellar
door
is
much
better
imo
though
o
refreshing
when
absolutely
cold
but
as
it
warms
up
it
harshens
up
too
not
the
best
but
not
really
the
worst
either
its
a
bold
saison
overall
its
a
pretty
good
saison
enjoyable
worth
having
again
and
again
when
the
saison
modes
hits
ive
been
going
out
of
my
way
to
try
several
saisons
this
summer
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
it
is
herbal
and
flowery
like
a
good
saison
should
be
but
it
brings
a
nice
subtle
fruitiness
to
the
game
that
makes
a
wonderful
complement
to
the
more
earthy
flavors
and
set
it
apart
from
some
others
i
have
tried
this
is
an
excellent
beer
more
citrus
fruit
and
floral
forward
than
the
cellar
door
for
me
and
reminds
me
of
the
classic
strain
from
dupont
in
many
ways
stillwater
is
brewing
some
damn
good
saisons
it
seems
i
gotta
track
me
down
some
debaucher
to
review
because
that
beer
was
amazing
ontap
a
few
months
back

so
not

funk
and
peppery
bitterness
bought
in
bottle
but
poured
into
glass
way
way
too
much
carbonation
to
enjoy
beer
as
fully
as
i
should
be
able
to
the
color
and
haze
are
very
nice
and
the
smell
is
fantastic
unfortunately
the
dry
somewhat
bland
taste
is
quite
a
disappointment
combine
that
with
the
subpar
mouthfeel
due
to
the
carbonation
and
i
graded
this
as
a
bit
better
than
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
but
only
if
someone
else
was
buying
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
the
single
price
i
payed
for
it
ill
definantly
try
other
stillwater
offerings
especially
now
that
theyre
in
4
packs
notes
tasty
from
start
to
finish
and
quite
drinkable
cheers
finishes
sweet
dry
and
bitter
an
excellent
saison
that
surely
could
compete
with
the
more
famous
ones
not
as
much
flavor
depth
as
imported
version
but
this
one
works
well
nice
balance
easier
drinking
as
you
get
thru
the
glass
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
and
try
to
pick
up
a
4pak
whenever
i
see
it
on
the
shelves
im
a
big
fan
of
the
boys
over
at
stillwater
and
encourage
everyone
to
try
their
stuff
as
they
will
not
be
disappointed
balance
is
a
bit
bitter
which
i
like
and
initial
tartness
is
absolutely
satisfying
great
yeast
character
that
helps
drive
the
entire
beer
a
must
have
saison
in
my
book
and
a
goto
saison
especially
for
the
price
when
compared
to
some
more
popular
imported
examples
great
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
well
saison
nothing
spectacular
about
it
just
very
good
o
great
refreshing
brew
to
quaff
in
the
summer
the
hoppiness
is
much
appreciated
i
also
appreciate
the
fruitiness
there
is
some
mustiness
but
it
is
subdued
will
certainly
reach
for
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
lightly
hazy
copper
gold
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
good
saison
it
has
a
huge
head
thick
white
and
pillowy
so
be
careful
while
pouring
excellent
lacing
the
head
takes
about
a
minute
or
two
to
die
down
to
a
finger
so
thick
it
looks
like
you
could
peel
it
off
it
certainly
isnt
going
anywhere
on
its
own
the
smell
was
that
of
nothing
more
than
a
golden
ale
spice
and
little
else
which
makes
the
taste
perhaps
even
more
enjoyable
than
it
is
on
its
own
cause
guess
what
its
a
ruse
this
is
one
complex
and
nicely
balanced
beer
i
am
usually
not
one
for
spicy
beers
so
saisons
are
tricky
for
me
this
one
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
the
spice
is
similar
to
maybe
a
belgian
dubbel
its
strong
but
well
complimented
there
is
also
some
decent
hops
presence
here
actually
nothing
is
very
subtle
its
all
pretty
strong
but
at
levels
that
dont
out
do
one
another
now
with
a
beer
like
this
you
can
either
add
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
or
not
this
will
do
one
of
two
things
depending
on
the
freshness
of
the
beer
this
one
is
still
only
about
two
months
old
and
i
made
the
mistake
of
not
checking
before
i
added
the
sediment
in
the
case
of
a
young
beer
it
is
going
to
make
it
spicier
however
if
you
have
a
beer
thats
been
around
a
little
longer
6
months
to
a
year
youre
going
to
get
some
added
banana
breadish
sweetness
and
body
which
is
what
i
was
going
for
without
really
thinking
oops
still
good
but
im
now
having
my
second
and
enjoying
it
much
more
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
bit
sticky
full
small
carbonation
overall
a
really
ideal
saison
i
have
a
new
regular
overall
an
excellent
saison
for
the
coming
summer
months
strong
enough
to
satisfy
the
beer
geeks
in
your
circle
yet
accessible
enough
for
even
the
bud
drinkers
to
enjoy
carbonations
seems
a
bit
excessive
o
a
very
good
brew
a
belgianamerican
ipasaison
hybridtype
of
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
o
stateside
is
an
excellent
full
bodies
saison
that
is
drinkable
and
forward
of
flavor
simultaneously
very
impressive
and
creates
a
mindset
to
come
back
for
more
almost
like
a
bready
champaign
probably
the
best
saison
i
have
had
o
a
very
fine
beer
indeed
excellent
standard
take
on
the
americanized
saison
complexity
is
there
if
you
look
for
it
but
you
can
simply
drink
and
enjoy
this
one
on
a
beautiful
spring
day
and
love
it
without
thinking
too
much
a
solid
saison
good
to
style
makes
me
look
forward
to
try
more
from
stillwater
one
of
the
best
american
made
saisons
for
sure
right
on
and
finally
in
a
12oz
bottle
thank
you
saisons
kind
of
come
and
kind
of
go
in
my
world
i
e
i
dont
really
get
a
lot
out
of
them
and
dont
find
many
embracing
that
damning
caveat
out
of
the
way
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
like
this
one
the
crazy
amount
of
input
flavours
are
deftly
integrated
subdued
even
into
a
straightahead
drinkable
affair
one
bereft
of
any
extreme
elements
which
may
be
the
one
aspect
of
this
style
that
i
do
wholly
endorse
when
suitably
followed
through
with
as
it
is
here
o
a
wonderful
saison
dry
floral
complex
and
funky
superb
well
done
complex
fresh
and
tasty
go
get
some
this
is
a
decent
saison
i
think
personally
it
would
be
a
bit
better
if
it
werent
so
bitter
when
combined
with
the
high
carbonation
the
bitterness
just
smashes
the
palate
with
a
dirt
like
taste
that
makes
this
beer
kind
of
hard
to
drink
o
this
is
a
bit
better
than
cellar
door
imo
so
glad
they
started
distributing
to
florida
o
first
crack
at
stillwater
and
i
enjoyed
this
a
good
farmhouse
ale
for
the
warmer
months
o
this
is
a
decent
saison
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
needs
more
flavor
and
smell
but
pretty
good
drinkable
beer
worth
a
try
if
its
not
an
effort
most
sour
of
the
4
offerings
ive
had
tonight
good
citrus
character
a
little
funk
a
decent
saison
though
its
not
the
side
of
the
style
that
i
prefer
little
funk
more
lightfruity
flowery
and
hoppy
than
i
like
but
not
bad
o
there
are
some
good
parts
of
this
brew
and
there
are
some
very
underwhelming
parts
of
this
brew
i
can
think
of
dozens
of
better
saisons
and
belgian
ales
that
i
would
prefer
before
this
not
that
its
a
bad
offering
the
appearance
and

are

nice

worth

spent
on

a

on
the
style
its
not
a
style
i
visit
often

this
was

can
see
why
people
would
like
it
just
not
for
me
still
interesting
and
something
i
would
recommend
where
this
beer
remains
creamy
as
most
authentic
versions
would
exhibit
champagnelike
dryness
this
is
where
i
struggle
to
find
characterize
the
beer
properly
as
well
as
a
stronger
conversation
between
the
fruit
and
spice
would
also
elevate
the

with
classic

this

though

i
liked
this
saison
pretty
well
its
not
overly
flavorful
compared
to
many
of
the
style
but
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
as
it
is
very
easy

pretty
refreshing

this
is
a

with

d
most

but
the

are
all
fubar
way
too
sweet

too
herbal
sort
of
oddly
herbal
as
well
not
enough
peppery
spicy
earthy

character
not
attenuated

dry

the
needed
matching

overall
o
this
is
a
solid
saision
im
really
enjoying
it
the
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
but
everything
works
nicely
together
if
this
were
available
in
my
area
id
buy
a
bottle
from
time
to
time
besides
all
the
foam
in
the
pour
its
a
great
beer
bright
and
fruity
but
not
a
fruit
beer
a
huge
sasion
fan
but
this
felt
all
over
the
shop
to
me
theres
some
promising
elements
but
they
seem
to
fight
each
other
concur
with
a
previous
reviewer
that
there
are
some
off
elements
pours
a
cloudy
honey
hue
which
leaves
a
creamy
three
finger
head
from
a
gentle
pour
and
lots
of
lacing
everywherethe
smell
straight
away
is
pineapple
its
really
strong
but
i
love
pineapple
so
thats
cool
also
some
funky
barnhouse
aromas
and
a
touch
of
banannathe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
tastes
of
lemon
sherbetpineapplemandarinsdragonfruit
and
the
finish
being
a
mix
of
light
citrus
and
candy
and
overall
its
definately
an
above
average
saison
and
i
would
definately
buy
again
cheers
o
not
my
favourite
saison
but
a
solid
multifaceted
and
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
o
not
bad
at
all
and
definitely
a
beer
i
want
to
revisit
again
when
its
fresh
this
bottle
was
at
least
5
months
old
d
easy
drinking
brew
and
definitely
easy
to
have
more
than
one
in
an

im
a
satisfied
customer
ive
heard
good
things
about
stillwater
so
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
one
of
their
beers
they
certainly
seem
to
be
able
to
pull
off
the
style
in
an
authentic
way
o
good
first
beer
from
stillwater
if
the
beer
was
slightly
drier
i
think
it
would
make
this
go
a
little
further
nonetheless
a
great
beer
explosive
carbonation
here
with
a
light
body
and
an
uncomfortable
lingering
feel
overall
this
one
is
a
disappointment
my
least
favorite
of
the
stillwater
offering
so
far
it
really
doesnt
come
together
and
has
some
off
flavors
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
an
initially
dense
white
head
the
head
falls
flat
but
he
beer
doesnt
smelling
this
beer
leaves
me
unsatisfied
but
im
willing
to
blame
a
certain
amount
on
it
being
served
too
cold
the
taste
paints
a
different
picture
there
is
an
incredible
sweetness
bitterness
interplay
followed
by
bold
yeast
character
the
beer
is
paired
with
some
fatty
duck
fries
excellent
mouthfeel
the
bitter
aftertaste
is
not
characteristic
of
most
saisons
but
its
a
nice
addition
its
worth
trying
and
a
great
bar
drink
will
pour
without
trying
a
five
finger
thick
cream
head
that
takes
forever
to
fade
leaving
a
good

amber
color
some

this
is
a
winner
in
my

the
only
real
problem
that
i
have
is
that
the
phenolic

fade
on
the

i
would
get
this
again

gypsy
brewing
seems
to
be
the
domaine
of
the
obsessed
thank
you
some
sweetness
is
quite
noticeable
at
first
sip
the
yeasty
flavors
add
to
the
fun
along
with
some
bitterness
of
the
belgian
funky
sort
hops
are
not
really
apparent
but
there
is
a
nice
edge
to
the
maltiness
another
nice
feature
is
the
big
fruity
tanginess
not
too
dry
and
not
too
acidic
a
touch
of
orange
rind
a
great
beer
that
make
the
saison
such
an
interesting
style
a
very
good
saison
very
citrus
based
as
opposed
to
funky
smooth
with
a
good
feel
this
is
very
enjoyable
o
for
the
pricepoint
there
are
better
and
cheaper
saison
but
i
enjoyed
his
and
would
have
it
again
this
beer
is
not
only
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
but
just
an
allaround
excellent
beer
stillwater
is
knocking
it
out
of
the
park
regularly
so
happy
i
can
purchase
their
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
buy
another
bottle
soon
this
has
been
sitting
in
my
beer
fridge
for
a
few
months
and
no
telling
how
long
it
was
on
the
shelf
prior
to
that
regardless
the
beer
has
held
up
quite
well
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
saisons
interesting
beer
lots
of
talking
points
but
also
the
sweetness
lends
this
a
drinkability
that
the
yeast
mars
at
times
d
highly
drinkable
yet
strong
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
beer
that
i
want
to
share
with
friends
who
have
yet
to
experience
the
wonderfulness
of
saison
o
tasty
beer
that
didnt
hold
up
to
one
year
of
cellaring
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
on
that
front
as
the
fresher
versions
hops
balance
the
malt
much
more
im
a
fan
and
will
still
seek
out
but
only
when
fresh
nice
aromas
dont
match
the
taste
anymore
overall
a
well
crafted
saison
with
moderate
but
well
done
flavors
slightly
more
carbonated
than
i
would
like
well
made
beer
would
have
again
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
nice
cap
of
frothy
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
of
hay
and
dried
grain
kiss
of
citrus
splash
of
peppery
spice
some
fresh
bread
light
watery
fruit
and
a
hint
o
earthy
funk
taste
follows
scent
milder
than
anticipated
but
still
blended
very
well
medium
bodied
dry
finish
a
good
saison
which
doesnt
wow
the
palate
but
is
solid
in
all
areas
a
pretty
interesting
saison
from
stillwater
and
an
interesting
introduction
to
the
brewery
it
has
loads
of
character
and
some
interesting
twists
but
manages
to
keep
it
all
well
within
the
realms
of
the
saison
style
thats
a
hard
ask
any
time
and
to
do
it
with
such
class
is
quite
a
skill
lovely
appearance
though
it
seems
to
have
some
rather
large
carbonation
bubbles
maybe
it
was
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
just
a
little
underwhelming
taste
is
excellent
good
spiciness
and
saison
rusticity
nice
peppery
quality
and
almost
a
bit
of
funkiness
mouthfeel
is
fine
well
worth
a
second
or
third
drink
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
true
saison
but
it
has
all
the
right
elements
of
one
i
recommend
it
overall
decent
enough
saison
nothing
memorable
taste
moderatley
sweet
with
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
much
hoppier
than
i
would
expect
from
a
saison
but
i
guess
that
is
what
makes
it
stateside
the
brett
is
noticeable
but
definitely
in
the
background
for
me
this
was
a
saison
with
a
twist
one
could
argue
it
was
part
way
to
an
american
strong
ale
so
frankly
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
hybrid
definitely
worth
a
try
recommended
o
very
much
a
saison
but
really
like
they
married
an
ipa
with
it
i
can
enjoy
that
youll
barely
get
anything
traditional
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
hops
youll
like
this
o
unfortunately
im
not
a
fan
of
funky
beers
so
i
couldnt
rate
it
too
highly
here
i
tried
to
be
at
least
somewhat
objective
with
my
other
ratings
but
this
was
over
the
top
and
i
poured
out
most
of
it
this
had
many
good
qualities
about
it
from
the
appearance
to
feel
but
the
actual
flavors
seemed
too
one
dimensional
for
me
though
for
the
style
its
plenty
good
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
drinkability
medium
to
high
depending
on
your
hop
tolerances
and
preferences
d
a
solid
and
easily
drinkable
saison
certainly
not
toptier
though
i
like
stories
drinked
at
brian
stillwater
conference
delirium
village
o

another
good
saison
from
stillwater
here
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
good
foamy
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
leaves
some
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
floral
and
grainy
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
between
some
grainy
malts
and
some
smooth
farhouse
funk
really
an
interesting
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
but
smooth
overall
very
good
stuff
overall
this
is
another
good
offering
from
stillwater
but
i
feel
like
the
price
is
still
higher
than
it
should
be
10
95
o
overall
a
very
solid
saison
from
the
crew
at
stillwater
o
just
not
as
excited
about
this
one
ive
had
it
a
few
times
before
and
while
it
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
im
just
too
stuck
on
fantome
o
not
the
most
inyourface
saison
ive
ever
had
which
depending
on
your
viewpoint
is
either
a
good
thing
or
a
disappointment
i
find
that
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
really
tasty
with
an
intense
spiciness
taste
of
alcohol
and
elements
of
belgian
beers
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
d
quite
drinkable
a
solid
beer
but
it
could
be
a
bit
more
intense
worth
checking
out
overall
a
nice
saison
with
good
balance
it
never
reaches
the
height
of
some
of
the
best
of
the
style
but
it
is
nice
nonetheless
o
excellent
example
of
a
saison
and
hides
the
6
8
very
well
slight
alcohol
great
saison
im
really
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
here
on
the
regular
mouthfeel
its
a
medium
to
full
body
beer
with
decent
carbonation
its
crisp
and
drinkable
stillwater
has
been
very
american
in
its
approach
to
this
classic
belgian
style
with
a
big
body
and
an
even
bigger
hop
presence
stateside
isnt
the
most
refreshing
or
stylistically
stringent
saison
out
there
but
its
a
tasty
new
addition
to
an
arizona
market
thats
always
ready
for
newcomers
overall
tasty
saison
the
meadow
grass
and
very
light
delicate
malt
notes
are
quite
nice
the
really
clean
hop
bitterness
makes
this
refreshing
even
though
the
somewhat
full
mouthfeel
counters
the
refreshing
aspects
of
the
beer
one
of
the
better
fully
americanstyle
takes
on
the
style
but
still
lacking
the
vibrant
fruitearthfunk
that
i
love
so
much
about
the
best
belgian
and
belgianstyle
examples
i
am
the
pickest
critic
when
it
comes
to
the
styles
that
i
love
most
saison
is
the
style
that
i
love
most
above
all
other
styles
so
yes
i
might
be
scoring
stateside
saison
by
too
strict
a
measure
i
cant
help
but
feel
though
that
this
should
be
labeled
a
biere
de
garde
the
two
styles
are
close
cousins
obviously
they
are
both
farmhouse
ales
and
the
styles
developed
in
extremely
close
proximity
to
each
other
this
beer
just
happens
to
taste
like
the
farmhouse
ales
of
france
more
than
those
of
wallonia
belgium
this
is
a
tasty
beer
just
not
a
great
example
of
the
saison
style
jd
very
solid
worth
the
price
not
sure
ill
definitely
try
a
few
more
from
them
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
with
lively
bubbly
and
light
mouthfeel
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
saison
with
a
stronger
musty
yeast
character
than
many
but
it
doesnt
quite
stand
out
against
the
best
of
them

digging
the
maltiness
at
all
medium
bodied
with
oily

slightly
bitter
finish
not
bad
but
too
malt
forward
for
my
tastes
overall
while
this
was
a
good
beer
its
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
would
certainly
drink
again
but
wont
become
a
staple
overall
is
good
this
isnt
my
first
bottle
ive
had
of
this
beer
and
i
could
certainly
see
buying
it
again
glad
i
picked
up
this
beer
will
seek
out
again

the
style
of
a

farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel

sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hops
and
slight
yeast
overall
not
complex
decent
appearance
and
aroma
onto
the
taste
at
first
you
get
the
sweet
fruity
flavors
lemons
citrus
and
apricot
with
a
mix
of
the
hop
for
a
little
bittering
effect
the
finish
is
more
spicy
and
peppery
with
a
touch
of
the
hops
lingering
through
out
quite
complex
and
quite
tasty
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
just
overall
a
truly
fantastic
beer
would
def
purchase
again
o
lots
of
pear
and
buttery
flavors
that
dominate
this
beer
the
fruity
esters
and
saison
yeast
blend
well
together
but
they
are
not
strong
enough
for
the
diacetyl
that
takes
over
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
nice
pear
and
cottage
cheese
flavor
underneath
with
the
yeast
and
fruit

a
great
herbal
spritzy

beer

attractive

yeasty
with
a
pleasantly
bitter

somewhat
dry
finish
its
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
excellent
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
excellent
saison
definitely
one
to
have
again
the
cpj
o
this
is
a
well
made
easy
to
drink
beer
extremely
drinkable
if
we
ever
get
some
warm
weather
up
here
it
would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
day
this
was
a
corrective
saison
i
split
a
large
bottle
with
my
wife
after
hacking
through
a
sam
adams
saison
earlier
in
the
day
id
give
this
an
a
if
not
for
two
things
the
sodapoppy
carbonation
which
adds
a
needlepointy
edge
to
everything
and
the
overhopping
which
adds
an
acidy
feel
that
belongs
in
an
ipa
not
in
a
saison
i
like
my
saisons
with
fewer
abrasives
and
a
bit
more
of
that
pillowy
yeasty
taste
if
you
like
to
belch
however
this
beer
will
give
you
championship
results
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
saison
wonderfully
complex
and
drinkable
a
perfect
complement
to
a
warm
afternoon
and
some
pretty
cool
label
artwork
as
well
enjoyable
even
if
not
and
everyday
beer
very
nise
saison
that
would
be
a
great
intro
saison
for
a
new
comer
to
better
beer
then
they
could
work
there
way
to
the
drier
saisons
enjoyed
on
tap
at
blue
monk
in
buffalo
poured
what
appeared
to
be
a
hazy
light
orange
color
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
see
in
the
light
from
the
bar
it
had
a
nice
efferescent
white
head
that
lasted
a
good
while
the
aroma
was
grainy
yeasty
slightly
citrusy
the
flavor
was
a
nice
balance
of
yeast
character
grainy
malt
backbone
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
some
lemon
and
grapefruit
citrus
light
spiciness
and
a
wonderful
tart
dry
finish
light
to
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
enjoyable
throughtout
with
nice
changes
as
the
temperature
warmed
the
beer
would
definitely
recommend
to
have
as
soon
as
possible
and
often
as
possible
shows
promise
but
for
now
entering
the
dustbin
of
mediocre
americanmade
saisons
sad
because
the
bottle
alone
makes
me
want
to
fall
in
love
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
some
frothy
foam
but
not
too
much
it
quickly
recedes
and
leaves
little
cover
on
the
beer
appearance
is
overall
average
smell
lemon
wheat
the
wheat
is
overpowering
and
a
little
off
putting
taste
sweet
bready
but
something
that
i
love
about
saisons
is
really
missing
here
i
love
the
cracked
pepper
and
coriander
flavors
i
dont
see
any
of
that
here
i
tried
the
stillwater
cellar
door
saison
a
few
days
ago
and
find
it
much
superior
to
this
one
o
im
struggling
with
this
because
a
its
way
too
carbonated
and
filling
and
b
its
overly
yeasty
a
solid
attempt
but
it
makes
me
weary
of
dropping
the
coin
on
their
other
offerings
too
earthy
overall
this
beer
is
good
and
fairly
well
crafted
but
falls
flat
of
many
examples
i
have
tried
that
posses
much
more
rustic
character
more
fruity
yeast
notes
and
much
higher
carbonation
dthis
beer
made
my
night
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
a
pleasant
aroma
along
with
a
very
nice
mouth
feel
i
see
that
there
are
some
dry
hopped
varieties
of
this
beer
i
suspect
that
dry
hopping
would
round
out
the
aroma
and
make
this
even
better
than
it
already
is
i
really
look
forward
to
a
warm
summer
afternoon
with
a
bottle
of
this
i
think
that
this
would
make
an
excellent
refreshing
summer
beer
o
a
nice
saison
and
easy
to
drink
i
feel
that
i
would
not
want
to
drink
this
too
often
but
would
like
to
keep
a
bottle
or
two
laying
around
for
when
i
am
feeling
this
very
drinkable
nice
rendition
of
a
saison
drinkability
good
verdict
too
expensive
to
be
a
great
beer
but
very
good
none
the
less
wont
cure
your
hankering
for
a
saisonfarmhouse
though
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
saison
from
stillwater
overall
my
first
offering
from
stillwater
artisanal
had
to
pick
this
up
after
reading
the
article
about
strumke
in
the
ba
mag
this
is
almost
ipa
meets
saison
and
after
further
rereading
the
article
that
seems
to
be
the
aim
of
this
one
so
nice
job
to
me
for
identifying
that
and
a
great
job
to
the
brewer
for
spoton
execution
so
far
so
good
i
will
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
more
from
stillwater
the
palate
is
rather
unique
surprisingly
juicy
from
the
hops
theres
a
little
grapelike
character
present
from
the
nelson
sauvin
i
guess
as
well
as
a
bitterness
thats
mildly
grapefruitlike
the
malt
character
isnt
as
raw
as
the
nose
suggested
and
it
is
whelmed
by
the
hops
and
the
yeast
here
like
any
good
saison
this
is
quite
spicy
and
moderately
phenolic
in
fact
the
first
few
sips
have
a
sharpness
to
them
that
i
cant
really
describe
better
drying
on
the
finish
with
hop
flavor
grapes
sweetlimes
spicy
white
pepper
a
little
nutmeglike
bitterness
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beverage
very
well
done

i
wish
this
had
been
a
little
more
crisp
and
dry
it
was
a
little
flabby
for
me
d
very
drinkable
very
good
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
complex
but
not
overly
dominated
by
one
aspect
poured
out
of
a
bottle
with
no
head
clean
smell
like
a
proper
saison
after
first
sip
it
tastes
like
a
great
example
of
what
i
like
in
this
style
i
taste
a
little
bit
of
spice
not
sure
if
there
is
any
or
if
its
just
the
yeast
straw
color
with
a
little
amber
and
hazy
this
is
a
very
good
no
nonsense
saison
d
this
is
a
really
tasty
saison
im
glad
stillwater
finally
made
it
to
missouri
if
only
this
were
drier
it
would
be
a
great
saison
for
me
it
checks
all
the
other
boxes
more
pepper
would
be
nice
too
but
this
is
not
that
variety
of
saison
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
saison
but
needs
to
be
sipped
slowly
given
its
intense
flavors
and
the
combination
of
bitterness
and
dryness
so
with
that
kind
of
head
you
know
to
expect
carbonation
and
good
lord
is
it
carbonated
its
kind
of
out
of
control
which
makes
it
memorable
but
that
wheaty
fresh
taste
might
suffer
i
recommend
this
to
try
once
but
not
a
huge
fan
overall
m
highly
carbonated
lighter
bodied
stillwater
is
an
ironic
name
for
a
brewery
that
is
creating
so
many
ripples
in
the
craftbeer
pond
the
mind
behind
this
outfit
is
clearly
a
visionary
and
fortunately
one
with
the
proper
appreciation
and
understanding
of
classic
styles
to
possess
the
necessary
tact
when
putting
his
own
personal
spin
on
them
stateside
saison
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
an
homage
to
old
world
tradition
and
a
celebration
of
new
world
innovation
good
spiky
mouthfeel
heres
my
stillwater
winner
so
far
drinkability
gets
to
be
solid
but
mostly
cause
this
saison
out
of
the
cask
comes
as
a
cross
between
and
american
ipa
and
a
weak
belgian
saison
minus
the
things
about
saisons
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
out
of
the
cask
is
not
a
typical
saison
at
all
so
keep
that
in
mind
if
you
are
a
fan
of
that
style
drinkability
a
quaffable
saison
for
sure
however
as
previously
mentioned
this
is
just
a
hint
too
sweet
and
for
the
price
i
would
pick
up
a
jp
saison
instead
i
will
say
there
is
no
alcohol
in
the
flavor
though
i
do
get
a
hint
of
warming
in
the
throat
from
each
sip
if
a
jp
saison
was
not
available
i
do
think
i
would
pick
this
second
from
the
others
i
have
tried
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
a
little
dry
drinks
well
light
alcohol
and
a
decent
balance
between
funk
and
spice
overall
not
super
impressive
but
a
solid
saison
this
is
a
solid
saison
with
a
good
balance
of
all
reviewing
categories
very
drinkable
and
tasty
d
compared
to
the
les
bons
voeux
of
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
this
brew
is
simply
very
good
but
it
still
has
a
lot
to
suggest
it
including
components
of
malty
sweetness
citrusherbal
hoppiness
and
yeasty
farmhouse
funk
that
still
packs
a
good
punch
of
saisony
goodness
poured
a

into
my
dogfish
head
globe

this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
honey
with
yeast
particulates
floating
around
in
the
glass
the
head
retention
is
spectacular
a
massive
4
finger
head
erupted
from
the
bottle
and
2
inches
of
creamy
white
head
are
always
perched
on
top
of
the
liquid
the
aroma
is
musty
funky
up
front
almost
like
a
closet
full
of
clothes
that
hasnt
seen
daylight
in
a
year
behind
the
funk
is
just
a
hint
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
just
a
little
bit
of
damp
grass
also
at
the
tail
end
of
the
aroma
is
under
ripe

fruits
hard
pears
and
apples
the
flavor
is
funky
damp
musty
earth
intermingled
with
hard

and
dried
hay
tasty
stuff
but
the
depth
of
the
flavor
profile
of
a
great
saison
just
isnt
there
regardless
its
tasty
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
not
cat
tongue
dry
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
beer
on
several
occasions
ive
even
brought
it
to
2
or
3
tastings
and
its
a
great
saison
i
wish
stillwater
distributed
to
missouri

this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
definitely
buy
this

drink
grab
one
very
nice

dthis
really
is
a
fantastic
beer
recently
at
a
beer
event
in
nyc
i
sampled
some
stillwater
for
the
first
time
and
was
blown
away
in
a
day
of
drinking
dozens
of
different
beers
the
stillwater
brew
cut
through
as
a
clear
highlight
stateside
saison
is
a
winner
and
a
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
again
and
again
3
5
d
good
beer
but
drinkability
suffers
from
the
vegetal
component
while
the
herbal
flavor
is
good
for
a
few
ounces
it
gets
old
before
the
second
glass
still
the
malts
contribute
tasty
and
aggressive
flavors
worth
a
try
a
good
saison
but
im
perplexed
by
its
spot
on
the
best
in
style
list
there
are
far
better
ones
out
there
burnt
gold
with
a
big
white
head
that
holds
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
nose
is
traditional
saison
with
hints
of
americanstyle
hops
popping
up
flowers
fruit
spice
pepper
euro
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
country
barn
all
ring
out
in
balance
very
impressive
medium
body
with
lively
carbonation
makes
for
a
nice
prickly
cleansing
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
to
date
and
definitely
my
favorite
american
made
saison
avant
guarde
traditional
yum
finally
a
breath
of
fresh
air
a
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
detected
and
tartness
on
the
finish
if
this
was
offered
in
12oz
bottles
itd
be
an
everyday
saison
for
me

i
know

ale
with
a
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good

and
great

consists
of
fruity

with
dry
floral
notes
form
the

with
some
light
funky
yeast
notes
also
discernable
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
funky
notes
with
floral
hops
and
dry
aftertaste
i
thought
the
malt
bill
was
great
if
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
own
taste
body
was
full
for
style
with
great
carbonation
and
no
signs
of
alcohol
very
well
brewed
and
something
i
would
seek
again
fro
sure
a
very
tasty
beer
but
way
too
funky
to
be
a
session
beer
a
bold
beer
for
those
with
an
adventurous
palate
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
glad
that
i
tried
this
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
big
huge
pour

a
ton
of
bubbles
and
a
massive
frothy
head
big
sweet
yeasty
notes
on
the
nose
a
ton
of
spice
and
banana
taste
was
a
typical
saison
very
earthy
but
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
that
carries
through
to
the
finish
very
drinkable
once
it
settles
as
well
as
complex
picking
up
some
funkiness
on
the
end
very
good
glad
i
grabbed
this
from
the
bottom
of
the
fridge
the
body
was
just
a
little
livelier
than
average
drinkability
was
very
good
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
overall
a
slightly
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
and
is
probably
worth
asking
for
in
a
trade
cheers

an
over
yeasty
saison

much
spice

but
some
good
notes
grassyness
and
a
faint
flavor
of
basement
too
many
malt
flavors
for
me
needs
to
be
more
simple
nice
effervecent
mouthfeel
however
a
little
tough
to
drink
and
slightly
cloying
overall
i
think
this
beer
tastes
a
bit
too
much
like
a
golden
ale
too
many
esters
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
zesty
and
hoppy
with
a
singular
flavor
profile
the
dryness
and
bitter
fruity
notes
really
distinguish
this
ale
from
its
peers
even
a
gentle
pour
is
going
to
get
you
between
three
and
four
fingers
worth
of
light
airy
bone
white
head
the
delineation
of
the

such
that
you
watch

the
foam
disappears

color

a
wealth

no
beads
at
all
more
like
softly
falling
snow
but
going
up
silky
smooth
nostril
presence
fits
like
a
1000
suit
which
in
some
ways
may
not
be
for
the
best
as
it
makes
it
harder
to
grab
the
scents
and
identify
them
in
any
event
theres
suave
orange

a

scone
breadiness
well
blended
banana
pineapple
peach
nectarine
yellow
apple
cherry
fruit
scents
no
clearly
dominant
force
no
real
chocolate
but
the
coriander
cumin
spice
sweet
enough
to
cover
clean
with
nary
a
trace
of
funk
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
and
the
carbonation
foams
up
quickly
certainly
contributes
to
additional
perfume
yet
forestalls
your
ability
to
really
get
into
the
flavors
that
said
überfriendly
orange
lemon
pink
grapefruit
citrus
as
well
as
apple
pear
peach
apricot
cantaloupe
fruit
anise
mint
chamomile
more
prevalent
here
the
yeasty
notes
soften
as
well
as
add
cling
factor
if
you
can
acclimate
to
the
level
of
carbonation
youll
find
that
it
is
a
fairly
dry
beer
with
good
outline
and
length
ambitious
beer
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
saison
style
beer
light
in
body
yet
packed
with
flavor
when
i
let
my
first
pour
with
the
huge
head
settle
down
the
brew
became
kind
of
flat
but
that
served
to
highlight
the
winelike
acidic
quality
of
the
beer
next
time
the
beer
was
colder
and
i
managed
a
better
pour
in
that
pour
the
flavors
were
much
better
integrated
nevertheless
i
think
it
is
the
citruswine
acidity
that
makes
this
an
especially
different
saison
food
pairers
be
on
the
the
lookout
this
will
go
with
lots
of
good
spicy
foods
honestly
this
could
go
with
any
dish
that
white
wine
sauvignon
blanc
chardonnay
goes
with
and
in
my
opinion
better
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
hints
of
orange
coloring
pretty
good
lacing
as
it
makes
its
way
down
the
nose
is
a
bit
light
but
brings
through
some
hay
orange
lemon
grain
and
some
light
stone
fruits
hints
of
earth
the
taste
is
similar
with
some
well
integrated
flavors
at
the
same
time
theres
nothing
too
deep
and
most
of
the
flavors
are
fairly
subdued
failing
to
produce
many
of
the
hardhitting
flavors
i
really
look
for
in
a
saison
feel
is
a
bit
dry
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
drinks
quite
well
and
im
excited
to
see
what
else
this
new
brewery
produces
d
this
was
a
wonderful
american
saison
honestly
the
only
reason
it
didnt
score
any
higher
was
its
relative
lack
of
rustic
funkiness
other
than
that
which
isnt
even
a
flaw
for
crying
out
loud
i
loved
this
beer

cant

to
try
more
from
stillwater
pour
is
clear
and
yellow
orange
with
a
large
head
of
very
thick
head
at
first
that
seems
to
be
less
and
less
assertive
as
the
bottle
gets
pour
not
as
it
sit
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
it
seems
the
carbonation
is
rich
but
gone
fast
nose
not
as
farmhouse
funk
and
hop
fused
as
others
but
the
hop
character
is
predominant
and
brisk
floral
grassy
lemon
zest
and
a
tad
herbal
but
nothing
that
could
be
pin
pointed
rosemary
thyme
or
sorts
hearty
earthy
meat
herbs
and
floral
palate
tight
on
the
tongue
and
cleansing
to
the
point
that
you
want
to
accommidate
the
dryness
in
the
mouth
a
bit
harder
on
the
gums
than
i
would
like
for
the
style
but
still
a
step
above
and
american
a
good
example
but
i
lacks
the
musk
i
enjoy
or
more
so
does
not
have
the
amount
i
would
expect
the
herbal
quality
seems
to
be
broader
in
that
this
is
just
a
soapy
interpretation
i
like
saisons
and
you
should
try
this
only
if
you
are
in
search
of
that
american
fashion
of
it
that
is
if
jolly
pumpkin
isnt
enough
a
very
good
american
saison
stateside
is
a
light
orange
beer
with
big
frothy
white
head
it
has
a
very
professional
tattoo
artinspired
label
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
some
funk
and
spice
i
smell
peppercorns
grapes
lemons
sweet
melon
and
fresh
grain
the
funk
is
light
though
definitely
present
it
tastes
light
to
medium
dry
with
good
bitterness
and
funk
the
flavor
is
a
bit
rounder
than
the
aroma
but
it
could
stand
to
be
drier
im
having
a
good
time
drinking
this
beer
its
refreshing
and
fullflavored
the
hop
choice
is
interesting
without
getting
in
the
way
of
the
style
this
was
a
happy
surprise
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
had
very
good
retention
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
looks
fantastic
aroma
is
herbal
woodsy
with
a
little
musty
note
in
the
background
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
heavy
phenolic
with
an
almost
overwhelming
herbal
quality
hay
and
pepper
as
well
dry
malt
charactor
bitterness
is
balanced
medium
body
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
goes
well
with
this
beer
not
the
flavor
profile
that
really
appealed
to
me
it
would
probably
be
a
good
pairing
beer
for
those
so
inclined
overall
a
nice
drinking
saison
a
good
representation
of
the
style
good
drinkability
as
well
picked
up
a
bottle
at
abes
cold
beer
and
split
it
with
a
couple
friends
this
amber
ale
has
a
tall
white
head
and
a
very
spicy
character
im
reminded
of
coronados
hoppy
daze
belgian
ipa
for
the
big
citrus
hops
mixed
with
coriander
while
the
hops
rule
along
with
the
the
belgian
spice
character
there
are
also
subtler
earthy
notes
and
while
this
is
delicious
i
think
its
distinctly
american
drinkability
is
pretty
good
certainly
thirst
quenching
while
i
hesitate
to
fault
them
for
the
dry
minerality
that
most
fail
to
achieve
when
then
attempt
the
style
this
starts
out
to
such
an
extreme
that
it
dampens
the
taste
until
i
pour
some
yeast
in
with
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
i
recommend
to
serve
it
mit
hefe
by
rolling
the
bottle
gently
on
the
table
before
opening
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
fairly
refreshing
saison
with
the
generous
hop
addition
definitely
a
well
crafted
brew
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
complexity
that
its
belgian
counterparts
contain
however
for
a
new
brewery
to
kick
off
with
a
beer
like
this
is
fairly
impressive
im
excited
to
try
a
few
more
of
their
offerings
worth
checking
out
overall
a
solid
offering
and
one
of
the
nicer
americanstyle
saisons
ive
had
glad
to
try
this

nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
refreshing
saison
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeast
with
some
spices
and
citrus
fruit
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
orange
and
lemon
with
some
belgian
yeast
and
assorted
spices

nice
drinkable
saison

mouthfeel

drinkability
i
was
looking
for
a
saison
and
this
one
definitely
satisfied
me
tasty
and
easy
to
consume
d
overall
a
very
solid
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
f
mostly
dry
finish
slight
lingering
creamy
malt
though
some
spices
still
there
with
a
touch
of
toasted
malts
lingering
slight
sticky
feel
as
well
as
the
sugars
disappear
slight
bitterness
perhaps
from
hops
or
just
the
spices
added
to
it
almost
a
slight
wheat
lingering
too
with
some
belgian
golden
malt
flavors
lingering
again
saison
like
but
not
really
farmhouse
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
slightly
heavier
beer
with
an
interesting
nosetaste
overall
a
very
solid
saison
stacked
up
next
to
the
guava
grove
earlier
in
the
day
it
certainly
held
its
own
pours
a
slightly
hazy
but
very
bright
golden
orange
with
a
slight
bubbly
head
that
leaves
small
splatches
of
lace
hanging
off
the
glass
the
smell
is
nice
and
refreshing
full
of
lemon
zest
slight
amount
of
funk
earthy
tones
and
citrus
sweetness
this
tastes
very
nice
simple
not
as
much
complexity
as
it
smelled
but
still
great
lemons
and
funk
come
through
with
a
nice
yeasty
zest
to
brign
it
all
together
so
easy
to
drink
light
on
the
tongue
and
perfect
for
a
summer
day
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
would
if
given
the
chance
p
s
in
looking
back
now
over
the
last
four
reviews
one
months
time
every
beer
was
purchased
at
capones
incl
mine
thats
just
straight
silly
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
refreshing
and
dry
as
it
warms
more
and
more
barnyard
musk
seeps
in
which
makes
for
an
interesting
if
not
particularly
groundbreaking
brew
drinkability
is
good
if
you
enjoy
saisons
and
like
a
bit
different
interpretation
of
one
without
knowing
for
sure
since
i
didnt
have
them
side
by
side
i
feel
like
the
tap
version
had
a
better
taste
than
bottled
poured
at
a
recent
ba
tasting
event
pours
a
cloudy
lighter
yellow
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
nose
is
citrus
and
funk
taste
is
apples
mango
barnyard
funk
leather
and
pink
grapefruit
pretty
complex
and
well
flavored
a
tiny
pinch
of
sourness
and
has
a
pleasant
grassy
aftertaste
that
lingers
a
bit
d
a
decent
saison
but
nothing
special
i
thought
it
had
a
nice
smell
to
it
but
not
much
to
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
not
bad
at
all
and
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
and
i
wouldnt
look
to
try
again
ambergolden
color
with
a
huge
head
that
seems
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
i
was
concerned
it
might
be
infected
at
first
moderate
spicy
and
earthy
aroma
mildly
coppermettalic
like
very
solid
malty
flavor
with
enough
spiciness
to
be
quite
noticeable
some
caramel
sweetness
though
the
whole
thing
phenolic
and
peppery
notes
velvety
smooth
creaminess
considering
the
spicy
bitequite
a
solid
mouthfeel
to
it
just
a
great
us
saison
lives
up
the
the
hype
i
have
read
about
this
beer
d
this
is
an
awesome
local
saison
much
like
a
hoppy
belgian
amber
ale
there
could
be
more
funk
present
to
make
this
better
for
the
stylebut
the
beer
as
is
is
really
good
saison
is
one
of
my
favorite
stylesive
had
the
good
the
bad
and
the
ugly
this
is
a
very
good
brew
though
a
bit
of
a
different
example
of
the
style
all
around
a
solid
as
far
as
this
beer
goes
the
beer
pours
honeyish
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
that
evaporates
fairly
quickly
smell
is
kind
of
like
freshly
cut
bales
of
hay
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
followed
by
a
bitter
taste
with
a
flavor
not
unlike
chamomile
but
stronger
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
the
beer
goes
down
easy
enough
that
going
back
for
a
second
wont
be
hard
to
fathom
at
all
another
example
of
a
good
maryland
brew
tried
this
one
at
the
recent
city
paper
brew
fest
in
baltimore
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
day
i
believe
this
is
one
of
the
first
saisons
ive
tried
beautiful
orange
in
color
woody
and
spice
in
smell
and
taste
highly
recommended
will
definitely
seek
this
out
and
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
nice
saison
it
certainly
will
be
enjoyable
to
those
that
like
all
saisons
including
american
interpretations
having
said
that
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
paler
malt
character
and
a
little
more
hop
aggressive
i
really
like
nelson
sauvin
hops
and
was
hoping
this
had
this
hop
featured
as
a
signature
note
instead
the
hops
while
substantial
play
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
yeast
character
and
to
a
lesser
degree
the
malt
which
does
actually
become
quite
a
bit
more
noticeable
and
complex
as
this
warms
it
is
a
bit
weird
that
i
feel
a
touch
disappointed
from
this
fantastically
tasty
brew
due
to
my
preconceived
notions
on
how
i
would
have
brewed
this
particular
beer
meaning
a
saison
with
nelson
sauvin
hops
in
the
end
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
am
quite
happy
to
be
polishing
off
a
750ml
bottle
of
this
d
pretty
decent
farmhouse
style
ale
although
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
heavy
on
the
earthy
notes
still
this
was
pretty
drinkable
overall
though
not
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
overall
this
was
perhaps
that
best
saison
that
i
have
had
but
i
am
by
no
means
an
expert
on
the
style
and
the
complexity
was
off
the
charts
well
done
stillwater
highly
recommended
d
very
drinkable
with
a
relatively
low
abv
price
tag
a
serious
saison
especially
when
you
consider
that
it
is
stillwaters
first
release
that
i
want
to
have
more
of
after
dinner
i
decided
to
try
one
of
these
shortly
thereafter
i
found
out
that
the
brewer
was
there
and
a
stillwater
event
was
taking
place
i
had
a
chance
to
chat
with
him
briefly
it
turns
out
that
this
is
his
brewerys
very
first
product
how
awesome
is
that
i
wish
them
continued
success
and
i
hope
all
of
their
offerings
are
as
good
as
this
one
prost
feel
is
lighter
than
medium
with
light
carb
light
pricks
smooth
as
silk
i
will
drink
this
again
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
tastes
really
nice
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
and
the
beer
finishes
cleanly
i
enjoyed
all
three
incarnations
of
this
beer
but
the
oak
chip
aged
was
slightly
better
imo
i
hope
to
get
more
of
this
beer
notes
great
firsoffering
from
stillwater
welcome
i
sure
look
forward
to
see
the
name
hold
itself
and
have
a
chance
to
provide
other
brews
in
the
future
nice
quality
offering
and
addition
to
the
beer
landscape
d
all
said
a
very
nice
effort
from
stillwater
impressive
for
a
first
release
and
one
i
hope
to
be
able
to
enjoy
for
some
time
to
come
gold
in
color
with
alot
of
head
smell
is
sweet
with
spice
maybe
coriander
or
lemon
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
spice
and
lemon
no
discernable
alcohol
mouthful
is
light
but
very
carbonated
overall
a
great
session
type
farmhouse
beer
the
price
is
really
good
and
if
i
liked
beer
i
might
love
this
one
nice
golden
color
and
for
the
most
part
clear
smell
of
lemon
pepper
and
sage
taste
of
pepper
and
coriander
with
sweet
finish
they
can
call
it
sage
but
i
get
more
clove
mouthful
is
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
and
slight
dryness
overall
its
a
unique
take
on
the
saison
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
saison
and
dream
weaver
mix
the
wheat
beer
is
definitely
present
gotta
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
overall
wow
what
an
incredible
beer
i
love
the
strong
flavors
of
fresh
herbs
and
spice
especially
the
sage
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
so
far
one
of
my
favorites
from
stillwater
all
of
which
have
greatly
impressed
me
and
have
scored
high
marks
highly
recommended
as
a
big
fan
of
saisons
this
was
a
nice
take
on
the
style
with
a
definite
focus
on
the
earthy
herbalness
of
the
sage
in
the
fore
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
say
it
shows
the
traditional
delicacy
of
the
style
still
a
nice
mix
of
citrusy
creamy
malt
and
yeasty
emerge
over
the
course
of
this
beer
and
its
a
pleasing
if
slightly
rollicking
trip
very
solid
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
lots
of
earthiness
present
with
the
peppery
zing
of
the
sage
on
the
finish
a
nice
effort
but
not
sure
its
with
the
price
point
rolls
out
with
a
pillow
head
that
i
had
to
wait
while
it
dissipated
good
retention
it
had
the
expected
saison
smell
with
a
good
bit
of
spice
the
flavor
was
very
nice
the
sweet
with
maybe
a
little
spiciness
very
clean
on
the
finish
outstanding
after
being
disappointed
with
my
first
few
tries
with
stillwater
this
one
was
excellent
and
will
have
me
giving
them
more
of
a
chance
outstanding
saison
light
golden
pour
slight
white
head
that
quickly
faded
llight
scent
sweet
and
sour
taste
is
surprisingly
sour
with
honey
lemon
and
indeed
sage
which
lingers
in
the
finish
sour
taste
is
shocking
at
first
but
after
trying
it
a
bit
more
i
quite
like
it
the
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
sour
and
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
interesting
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
tasty
one
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
this
style
over
the
top
spiciness
and
that
saison
earthiness
very
good
beer
this
is
the
first
stillwater
beer
that
turned
me
onto
them
pours
a
gold
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of

malt
hint
of
hops
yeast
hint
of
pepper
sage
hint
of
rosemary
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp

crisp
with
a
high

level
tastes
of
black
pepper

hint
of
hop
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
hint
of

overall
great
appearance
great
aroma
great
body
great
blend
and
great
complexity
mouthfeel
was
good
nicely
carbonated
with
the
spices
adding
some
interest
crisp
sharp
feel
on
the
whole
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
but
an
outstanding
saison
i
dont
think
so
overall
totally
unexpected
unique
tasting
and
another
great
saison
and
pickup
from
the
stillwater
gang
why
have
i
never
found
this
before
o
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
more
spicy
than
sweet
flavor
profile
aroma
and
carbonation
hold
up
well
through
a
slow
drink
an
improvement
on
the
standard
wit
beer
spicy
black
pepper
beer
with
a
dry
finish
and
medium
body
nice
hop
backbone
light
tropic
fruits
smells
of
funky
saison
yeast
and
very
sweet
malts
taste
is
thankfully
not
as
sweet
flavor
is
very
spicy
but
most
of
that
must
come
from
the
yeast
if
sage
is
all
thats
added
and
i
cant
really
pick
out
sage
in
particular
there
is
a
strong
vanilla
note
throughout
also
that
i
didnt
expect
but
enjoyed
easy
drinking
but
a
little
too
sweet
in
the
finish
stillwater
beers
are
uncommon
around
here
but
ill
be
looking
for
this
and
other
stillwater
beers
again
fresh
fruit
cheese
delicious
o
great
saison
like
farmhouse
ale
balanced
well
will
buy
again
this
is
different
for
a
saison
its
a
sage
wheat
beer
on
the
nose
and
a
medium
bodied
ipa
on
the
palate
interesting
but
im
not
sure
the
whole
experience
is
coherent
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
saison
has
the
classic
fruity
floral
notes
of
a
god
saison
but
is
also
unexpectedly
boozy
and
rich
this
is
a
slow
sipper
if
you
like
barley
wines
and
saisons
and
are
curious
to
try
something
in
between
then
this
is
for
you
o
excellent
brew
my
first
by
stillwater
got
at
bruisin
ales
drank
on
deerfield
beach
fl
july
18th
2014
o
4
this
is
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
but
not
very
well
balanced
i
like
the
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
but
the
sage
and
other
unique
flavors
overpower
the
farmhouse
characteristics
one
would
expect
in
this
style
of
beer
o
i
dont
think
this
one
benefited
much
from
age
way
too
carbonated
as
well
better
balance
in
the
taste
i
get
a
creamy
pale
malt
start
followed
by
the
aforementioned
spices
the
swallow
is
really
a
terrific
blend
of
the
two
slightly
sweet
long
lasting
and
unusual
aftertaste
in
a
word
fascinating
the
body
leans
to
the
thin
side
and
the
carbonation
is
high
but
the
combination
seems
to
work
saisons
are
probably
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
by
far
incredible
refreshing
and
tasty
see
it
get
it
o
this
is
a
pretty
delicious
saison
very
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
nice
fruity
and
floral
flavors
this
libation
was
procured
at
the
highly
esteemed
bier
abbey
in
schenectady
it
arrived
at
the
table
a
light
apricot
in
color
and
quite
hazyin
fact
translucent
the
head
was
thin
and
lacing
light
when
it
comes
to
saisons
i
am
almost
always
at
a
loss
in
describing
taste
and
aroma
in
this
case
the
fragrance
was
that
of
herbs
i
can
say
no
more
except
perhaps
that
the
slightest
perception
of
mint
seemed
to
surface
the
flavor
as
well
was
imprecisely
and
very
pleasantly
herbal
with
a
strength
that
was
surprising
is
there
some
citrus
is
there
a
spicy
piquancy
perhaps
after
a
few
draws
from
the
glass
however
the
need
to
analyze
recedes
the
beer
tastes
goodthats
what
mattersand
well
distinguished
its
presence
on
the
palate
is
foamy
and
smooth
its
finish
both
in
taste
and
feel
is
quite
fresh
the
taste
is
very
good
with
lots
of
complexity
from
yeast
giving
some
fruity
flavors
with
mix
of
spice
and
light
malt
backing
which
comes
off
as
dry
yet
light
toasted
with
mild
tangy
yeast
element
and
mild
earthy
spice
coming
in
later
with
a
crisp
peppery
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
great
beer
highly
enjoyable
and
the
only
adjustment
i
would
make
would
be
with
the
spice
level
since
it
relies
a
little
bit
on
the
herbspice
in
the
flavoraroma
rjt
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer

nice

profile
but
not
above
and
beyond
with
unique
herbal
flavors
as
id
hoped
overall
this
beer
didnt
wow
me
as
much
as
as
follows
existent
or
especially
folklore
its
just
came
off
too
simple
so
maybe
a
fresh
bottle
will
capture
this
wow
factor
eveyone
has
it
was
still
a
decent
brew
though
this
surprised
me
though
the
ratings
are
on
the
good
to
very
good

the

today
is

wow
that
is
nothing
short
of
amazing

an
easy

saison
nice
notes
of
white
pepper
some

tart
lemons
and
a
pleasant
wheat
finish
the
sage
is
not
overbearing
but
complimentary
and
the
wheat
makes
it
extra
refreshing
recommended
overall
awesome

ill
have
another

a
tasty
saison
with
a

this
is

ogreat
farmhouse
beer
from
stillwater
looking
forward
to
trying
stateside
and
existent
overall
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
beers
by
stillwater
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
this
i
will
still
shy
away
from
farmhouse
because
i
cannot
drink
more
than
one
without
being
overwhelmed
by
complex
flavors
of
sugar
and
fruit
pours
a
bright
orangeyellow
like
watereddown
tang
a
bit
cloudy
very
little
head
an
interesting
smell
mostly
citrus
orange
zest
tangerines
some
grass
a
bit
of
a
funk
the
taste
is
quite
exceptional
and
not
very
subtle
right
away
a
sharp
lemony
intense
tartness
sour
citrus
then
it
eases
a
bit
on
the
citrus
and
thats
where
some
herbal
flavors
come
in
sage
grass
as
well
as
a
much
needed
but
not
overbearing
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
almost
pure
tangerine
oil
and
zest
slightly
viscous
subtle
carbonation
very
fine
bubbles
extremely
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
or
so
i
can
imagine
why
am
i
drinking
this
in
january
in
alabama
and
not
in
august
well
it
was
on
the
discount
table
at
2
bucks
a
bottle
definitely
one
id
search
out
for
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
most
certainly
be
picking
more
of
it
up
in
the
summertime
as
it
is
more
fitting
for
that
time
of
the
year
than
right
now
at
the
start
of
winter
if
you
like
saisons
and
havent
had
this
one
yet
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
try
gold
and
very
slightly
hazy
head
is
small
white
and
leaves
nice
stringy
lace
aroma
is
stinky
herbal
dank
cardamom
i
thinksomething
bright
and
peppery
lemongrass
all
over
a
nice
unusual
combination
taste
is
sweet
grape
lemongrass
again
pepper
sage
earthy
and
funky
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
juicy
very
interesting
beer
and
certainly
enjoyable
i
dont
pick
up
on
the
sage
right
away
in
the
smell
it
mostly
seems
very
herbal
flavor
is
where
i
actually
notice
it
among
many
other
things
not
to
be
sessioned
with
but
nice
herby
treat
for
sure
four
packs
just
hit
the
state
cool
beans
this
pours
apple
juice
color
into
a
wine
glass
with
a
smallish
white
head
it
looks
clear
for
a
saison
and
not
overly
carbonated
the
sage
is
intense
on
the
nose
very
up
front
french
saison
yeast
gives
at
the
familiar
acidity
and
juiciness
very
very
soft
wheat
malt
taste
with
the
sage
being
more
balanced
but
still
quite
pronounced
herbal
and
earthy
lasting
in
the
finish
too
the
yeast
is
a
little
too
strong
this
tastes
almost
off
although
it
isnt
the
proportionality
is
skewed
its
not
as
delicate
as
it
could
be
and
this
is
exacerbated
by
underwhelming
carbonation
its
not
flat
but
it
doesnt
pop
makes
it
a
little
heavier
and
really
i
dont
want
a
six
pack
four
is
enough
of
these
for
me
not
as
well
polished
as
some
other
stillwater
stuff
but
a
creative
beer
worth
trying
overall
comes
off
like
a
spiced
wit
but
the
extra
tartness
and
earthiness
really
kick
it
up
a
notch
very
very
nice
id
definitely
get
this
again
o
excellent
farmhouse
ale
great
flavors
and
aromas

after
a
rather
top
heavy
pour
and
waiting
several
minutes
its
a
hazy
golden
ale
with
a
very
large
white
frothy
head
strong
spicy
phenolic
aromas
herbal
slightly
hay
like
nice
flavour
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
a
very
nice
dry
spicy
finish
overall
a
nice
palate
on
this
very
vibrantgood
level
of
carbonation
for
style
an
unusual
find
in
salem
oregon
but
very
nice
regardless
o
interesting
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
im
also
glad
i
only
bought
1
bottle
the
price
just
isnt
worth
it
in
my
opinion
too
much
alcoholbitterness
out
of
balance
bottle
says
it
is
an
american
farmhouse
ale
a
wheat
ale
brewed
with
sage
sage
yes
sage
white
sage
packaging
despite
having
perhaps
quaint
intentions
looks
pretty
spooky
i
mean
you
think
cellar
door
first
thing
i
think
is
bodies
then
bugs
then
maybe
an
old
dead
cat
but
no
this
really
is
a
good
farmhouse
ale
and
the
sage
is
a
nice
addition
it
pours
a
pearlescent
amber
with
short
head
and
you
definitely
get
the
sage
in
the
nose
pretty
prominently
along
with
berry
and
spice
flavor
is
tart
slightly
sweet
a
little
sour
and
sagey
for
sure
body
is
medium
almost
approaches
thick
with
everything
going
on
with
the
sage
and
is
this
hopped
i
dont
know
definitely
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
though
good
probably
great
but
i
dont
think
id
get
it
again
only
because
of
the
price
and
the
four
pack
format
otherwise
its
awesome
get
it
open
the
cellar
door
all
around
a
great
beer
im
sure
to
buy
more
of
this
overall
this
was
my
first
stillwater
and
i
was
very
impressed
im
a
growing
fan
of
the
farmhouse
ale
style
and
this
was
a
good
one
well
balanced
and
everything
works
well
together
hard
to
articulate
the
flavor
but
the
spices
and
hints
of
pinelemon
really
work
i
will
certainly
try
more
from
this
brewery
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spice
and
sage
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
yeast
and
sage
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
sage
presence
that
comes
across
slightly
better
in
the
aroma
o
neat
beer
i
never
had
anything
like
this
i
need
to
remember
to
seek
out
a
fresher
sample
next
spring
add
some
fresh
citra
to
what
i
just
experienced
wow
o
another
fantastic
offering
from
stillwater
i
definitely
wish
it
had
more
hops
and
sage
flavor
but
im
sure
thats
because
the
bottles
have
been
sitting
around
for
a
while
i
recommend
getting
this
one
fresh
if
you
can
but
fresh
or
old
its
a
complex
and
refreshing
beer
a
combination
that
you
dont
see
very
often
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
interesting
saison
but
a
bit
flat
overly
spiced
and
a
bit
soapy
although
the
hop
bitterness
is
noticeable
the
sweetness
and
citrus
flavors
balance
it
out
to
keep
the
bitterness
down
a
little
more
funk
than
the
usual
saison
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
this
beer
delivers
a
satisfying
taste
and
aroma
experience
while
a
bit
more
bold
in
some
areas
than
i
might
like
it
still
provides
a
smooth
and
refreshing
taste
and
feel
if
theres
a
movie
line
that
matches
this
beer
it
would
be
just
when
i
thought
i
was
out
they
pull
me
back
in
nicely
done
12oz
bottle
around
six
months
old
color
is
hazy
orange
decent
head
smells
good
but
its
sort
of
spicy
peppery
herbal
saisonlike
good
flavor
was
really
strong
soap
potpurri
herbs
not
really
pleasant
and
a
deviation
from
the
smell
i
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
overall
perhaps
more
of
a
wit
or
weiss
than
a
farmhouse
ale
but
incredibly
delicious
nonetheless
this
definitely
seems
to
borrow
a
few
flavor
profiles
from
a
german
weiss
the
banana
leaf
cloves
and
accentuated
wheat
flavors
are
all
blended
into
a
traditional
belgian
farmhouse
ale
recipe
to
create
something
slightly
different
for
that
reason
i
give
it
a
higher
rating
because
its
not
just
trying
to
follow
a
traditional
recipe
or
do
what
everyone
considers
a
farmhouse
saison
this
stands
out
a
bit
more
from
the
group
and
for
that
i
really
like
it
light
fluffy
but
super
carbonated
sweet
tangerine
citrus
and
tart
fruits
very
subtle
could
be
the
age
spicy
earthy
and
herbal
finish
dry
finishe
with
soft
lingering
fruitiness
and
dryness
hoppy
bitter
bite
builds
slowly
as
a
nice
contrast
to
some
of
the
sweeter
aspects
its
a
good
beer
but
my
body
definitely
does
not
enjoy
it
id
be
willing
to
trade
a
bottle
for
some
extra
strength
tums
right
now
oanother
stellar
saison
by
stillwater
artisanal
ales
grab
a
four
back
of
this
if
you
can
and
enjoy
every
sip
this
beer
would
be
great
without
the
sage
addition
but
i
love
how
it
adds
depth
to
this
already
intricate
beer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
company
very
drinkable
would
buy
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
like
a
deep
dark
piss
the
beer
forms
a
light
head
of
pale
white
bubbles
that
quickly
fizzle
away
to
a
thin
almostnonexistent
scrim
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
clean
but
murky
with
just
faint
suggestions
light
and
shapes
coming
through
from
the
other
side
of
the
glass
upon
further
examination
tiny
specs
can
be
seen
floating
in
the
beer
though
none
are
of
a
considerable
size
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
smoothly
funky
with
saison
yeast
and
a
good
touch
of
pepper
that
spices
the
nose
pineapple
and
a
touch
of
orange
juice
can
also
be
sensed
on
the
nose
along
with
a
nice
light
wheat
flake
scent
that
suggests
the
beers
malt
the
pineapple
smell
blends
in
and
out
of
the
funk
smell
suggesting
a
presence
of
juicier
hops
and
some
nice
haylike
funk
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
fruity
sweet
and
acidic
with
a
light
tart
pucker
to
the
mouth
and
a
very
light
touch
of
bitterness
which
comes
through
more
in
the
aftertaste
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
light
wheat
malt
immediately
exploding
into
huge
pineapple
bursts
of
flavor
with
herbal
funky
side
flavors
and
a
light
bitter
grapefruit
the
funk
is
deep
enough
that
i
think
i
detect
some
brett
in
the
flavor
though
i
didnt
think
this
beer
had
any
in
it
the
finish
is
dry
yet
full
of
pineapple
funk
flavors
and
just
a
touch
of
wheat
malt
which
the
aftertaste
accentuates
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
sharp
in
carbonation
coming
in
somewhere
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
while
the
body
sits
on
the
tongue
comfortably
at
a
medium
weight
the
mouth
is
left
dry
except
for
acid
cancelling
saliva
on
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
and
a
light
stickiness
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
saison
with
some
rich
complexity
it
is
delicate
and
very
fruity
with
its
funk
most
likely
due
to
the
addition
of
white
sage
its
not
my
favorite
american
farmhouse
ale
though
its
good
and
tasty
and
i
would
never
turn
it
down
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
the
type
of
beer
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
at
a
sitting
as
it
sits
in
the
stomach
a
little
heavy
its
rich
and
complex
but
it
doesnt
light
up
my
palate
like
it
has
for
others
poured
into
tulip
translucent
yellowgold
with
a
lively
big
white
head
that
fades
fast
leaving
chunky
lacing
smells
yeasty
crackery
malt
and
hint
of
sage
its
brewed
with
white
sage
crisp
floral
hops
lemon
rind
taste
is
lemon
rind
biscuity
malt
slight
herbal
sage
flavor
citrusey
floral
crisp
hops
yeast
mouthfeel
is
lively
fizzy
and
clean
finish
is
dry
delicious
adn
refreshing
o
this
is
a
nice
saison
as
i
always
say
i
tend
to
like
some
brett
in
my
saisons
and
there
isnt
much
to
be
found
here
still
the
musty
character
is
almost
there
due
to
the
strong
presence
of
earthy
herbal
and
floral
aromas
and
flavors
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
just
chill
out
with
on
a
summer
day
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
them
due
to
the
abv
and
complexity
its
just
a
lot
to
take
in
but
its
still
certainly
very
drinkable
nice
beer
from
stillwater
and
ill
definitely
be
trying
more
o
overall
very
crisp
lightly
tart
and
musky
with
a
very
easy
approach
this
is
very
easy
to
consume
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
in
multiples
a
great
summer
tart
summer
drink
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
of
all
the
american
saisons
i
have
had
i
find
this
one
to
be
most
similar
to
the
classic
saison
dupont
but
the
use
of
american
hops
and
the
addition
of
sage
add
their
own
character
cellar
door
does
the
style
very
well
and
adds
its
own
unique
twists
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
tolerable
o
really
enjoyable
saison
if
you
enjoy
sage
i
loved
this
one
overall
i
am
getting
used
to
this
beer
maybe
this
approach
to
flavor
s
more
common
than
i
thought
but
it
is
the
first
one
i
have
had
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
the
spice
really
adds
an
interesting
dimension
to
this
beer
overall
very
enjoyable
nice
peppy
with
lots
of
flavors
everywhere
complex
tasty
and
fun
all
rolled
into
one
nice
saison
overall
very
solid
beer
and
very
close
to
being
a
four
definitely
worth
a
try
unless
you
hate
sage
o
an
interesting
saison
the
appearance
and
nose
were
a
bit
underwhelming
but
the
first
sip
of
this
convinced
me
that
this
is
a
beer
to
be
taken
seriously
as
the
first
beer
from
stillwater
artisanal
ales
that
ive
tried
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
the
body
is
medium
and
theres
certainly
a
creamy
feel
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
end
but
remains
pretty
well
moderated
the
crispness
is
second
to
the
smoothness
but
is
there
particaularly
as
the
finish
goes
slightly
tangier
in
a
good
way
soft
wheat
and
light
sweetness
up
front
herbal
spicy
bitterness
falls
in
behind
but
sticks
around
grainy
slightly
fruity
pear
malts
midpalate
accented
by
belgian
yeast
funk
sage
and
tea
spiciness
come
on
strong
and
meld
with
the
simmering
herbal
spicy
bitterness
into
the
finish
lingering
pear
yeasty
notes
and
sage
moderate
body
with
a
lively
prickly
feel
not
the
best
stillwater
beer
i
have
had
yet
but
interesting
no
doubt
bottom
line
great
brew
from
stillwater
o
this
was
so
good
really
nice
balance
between
the
softer
malts
and
crisp
hops
slight
blanchedout
tartness
very
smoothdrinking
and
crisp
at
the
same
time
supremely
herbal
and
spicy
yet
somehow
balanced
out
and
super
complex
worth
trying
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
americanmade
farmhouse
ale
overall
a
nice
beer
i
think
the
sage
is
a
bit
overdone
but
others
might
really
like
a
saison
with
this
kind
of
earthy
herbal
edge
i
do
like
the
mustiness
on
the
nose
and
wish
more
saisons
could
capture
it
serving
type
bottle
overall
fruity
tropical
and
bitter
a
very
refreshing
combination
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
is
the
most
popular
beer
at
of
love
and
regret
o
subjectively
saisons
are
pretty
hitandmiss
for
me
id
easily
call
this
a
hit
though
thanks
to
its
balance
between
drinkability
and
good
but
not
great
complexity
o
interesting
brew
not
as
drinkable
as
some
other
stillwater
beer
but
a
much
more
unique
flavor
profile
now
that
i
wrote
the
review
and
have
read
the
brewers
description
i
think
he
describes
the
ale
damn
near
perfectly
i
just
would
have
never
guessed
that
he
used
citra
hops
whatsoever
i
would
love
to
know
where
he
used
them
in
the
process
the
body
was
about
average
for
the
style
perhaps
a
bit
fuller
than
a
lot
of
examples
and
had
a
nicely
dry
finish
drinkability
was
very
good
a
couple
of
these
could
go
down
easily
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
im
not
quite
sure
it
was
worth
the
812oz
price
but
it
was
still
worth
a
shot
accomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
do
a
great
beer
to
take
you
from
winter
in
to
summer
light
and
easy
drinking
with
enough
complexity
to
let
you
know
its
not
just
a
lawnmower
beer
a
damn
fine
american
farmhouse
ale
very
good
rendition
of
the
style
herbal
and
spicy
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
a
foggy
glowing
gold
hue
with
a
rather
disappointing
thin
white
covering
bright
herbal
sage
and
peppercorn
aroma
grassy
yeasty
and
very
fresh
smelling
good
sage
notes
continue
in
the
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
like
some
beers
that
utilize
herbs
spicy
flowery
lemon
peel
lavender
yeast
and
slight
cracker
malts
light
crisp
and
very
drinkable
love
the
12oz
bottle
ill
be
buying
a
4pack
soon
o
nice
and
complex
yet
easily
drinkable
and
approchable
im
glad
i
got
a
pack
and
not
just
a
single
o
very
pleasant
farmhouse
beer
i
enjoyed
the
mild
tartness
in
the
finish
as
well
as
the
spice
and
muted
saison
yeast
a
very
seasonal
beer
of
which
a
bomber
went
down
easily
the
only
downfall
was
the
overcarbonation
and
noticeable
heat
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
pours
golden
from
the
bottle
with
big
tall
head
aroma
of
lemon
zest
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
yeast
funk
light
mouthfeel
with
big
flavor
sweet
honey
similar
to
a
tripel
but
with
nice
zesty
citrus
and
a
little
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
a
nice
crsipness
and
afterbite
from
the
sage
and
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
one
of
the
most
flavorful
wits
i
have
had
and
easy
drinking
good
stuff
i
have
had
mixed
feelings
about
stillwater
things
i
have
tried
but
this
was
knocked
out
of
the
park
o
frothiness
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
definitely
a
sage
lovers
beer
but
only
a
decent
saison
better
once
you
burn
off
some
bubbles
a
decent
enough
stateside
saison
i
know
that
im
cribbing
this
from
another
stillwater
offering
with
the
extra
ipaesque
hopitude
and
schizoid
spice
usage
just
adding
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
en
fonction
de
la
santé
mentale
de
la
brasseur
to
the
whole
deal
at
any
rate
a
pleasant
not
overly
boozy
saturday
night
special
oa
nice
saison
from
stillwater
with
good
flavors
easy
drinking
o
what
a
fantastic
saison
light
zippy
sweet
citrus
sour
peel
nice
spice
delicate
stone
with
a
slightly
bready
finish
sun
in
a
bottle
with
complex
spice
and
heft
this
is
a
winner
o
a
bit
more
hop
and
alcohol
presence
than
im
used
to
in
a
saison
but
it
works
out
well
in
the
end
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
stouts
and
winter
brews
associated
with
the
season
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
not
only
suits
the
taste
of
summer
but
will
reward
any
belgian
ale
appreciator
year
round
and
im
considering
regrowing
my
mullet
light
body
and
well
carbonated
scrubs
the
tongue
clean
without
being
aggressive
a
solid
saison
o
very
pleased
with
this
beer
solid
example
of
a
farmhouse
ale
d
good
overall
balance
between
hops
spices
and
yeast
character
o
good
stuff
really
good
stuff
overall
4
5
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
with
good
reason
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
the
beer
are
both
so
balanced
and
have
so
much
going
on
without
being
confounding
in
any
way
the
sage
feels
like
such
a
perfect
fit
with
the
saison
yeast
as
do
the
citra
hops
but
on
different
ends
of
the
spectrum
sage
complementing
the
spicy
esters
and
the
citra
complementing
the
fruity
esters
of
the
yeast
respectively
thats
my
feeling
anyway
whats
also
great
about
this
is
that
its
a
topnotch
saison
that
would
be
a
great
introduction
the
style
for
those
unfamiliar
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
highly
recommend
it
and
will
absolutely
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
o
a
solid
saison
the
use
of
sage
is
interesting
but
it
loses
some
points
on
drinkability
anything
past
67
oz
becomes
difficult
to
drink
because
the
sage
and
spice
become
very
overpowering
as
is
all
too
often
the
case
theres
no
reason
for
this
to
be
in
a
bomber
d
this
was
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
as
it
warmed
it
seemed
to
express
more
and
more
flavors
and
it
looks
beautiful
from
start
to
finish
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
orangey
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
hoppy
notes
with
light
spices
and
a
medium
sweet
malt
backbone
is
quite
interesting
taste
is
a
complex
mix
between
some
lightly
sweet
rustic
malt
notes
with
some
fruity
ester
with
dry
hoppy
notes
with
light
notes
of
spices
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
easily
drinkable
while
providing
quite
a
lot
of
complexity
pours
light
golden
diaphanous
with
a
sheet
of
white
foam
and
nice
lace
nose
is
peppery
sage
citric
tones
lime
coriander
grain
and
good
yeast
character
flavor
is
full
grain
good
clay
like
yeast
some
hints
of
mint
coriander
lime
orange
chickpeas
and
some
pepper
medium
on
full
bodied
with
hi
carb
and
some
dryness
on
the
finish
another
good
showing
from
this
brewery
i
only
recently
approached
signed
by
the
brewer
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
teku
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
spice
fruit
passion
fruit
kiwi
and
floral
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
banana
spice
earth
alcohol
and
passion
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
i
really
went
into
this
one
expecting
to
find
a
huge
earth
dominance
going
on
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
the
fruit
aspect
dominated
this
one
while
still
having
the
earthiness
present
all
was
well
but
i
just
wish
that
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
balanced
as
the
earthiness
was
the
dominate
factor
in
it
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
fruit
but
it
kind
of
clashed
with
the
earthiness
and
alcohol
definitely
a
must
try
for
any
saison
fan
out
there
without
a
doubt
in
all
a
well
balanced
very
good
saison
nose
is
slightly
funky
with
orange
citrus
and
fresh
cut
straw
flavors
are
similar
with
an
added
green
apple
finish
i
would
recommend
this
for
someone
trying
a
herbal
beer
for
the
first
time
very
nice
indeed
i
had
it
again
10
months
later
and
hits
the
spot
good
spice
coriander
its
not
what
i
typically
look
for
in
a
saison
but
is
really
interesting
tasty
and
not
easily
forgettable
this
drank
too
easy
love
the
citra
hops
in
this
puts
a
nice
american
spin
on
this
style
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
go
beer
had
on
tap
at
maxs
described
as
a
witbier
with
sage
on
the
beer
list
interesting
to
see
it
as
a
saison
on
here
regardless
this
was
a
damn
refreshing
wit
and
the
sage
added
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
on
the
back
end
full
flavored
and
refreshing
its
a
great
twist
to
the
style
that
works
very
well
overall
im
impressed
i
think
this
is
my
first
from
stillwater
and
theyve
definitely
earned
a
spot
on
my
buy
it
when
i
see
it
list
different
over
carbonated
for
sure
dont
think
i
could
finish
a
whole
bomber
between
the
carbonation
and
sage
presence
overall
very
impressive
one
of
the
most
carbonated
beers
ive
ever
had
surprised
it
didnt
gush
o
very
nice
not
my
favorite
saison
and
i
dont
get
the
white
sage
notes
but
i
do
like
this
one
anyways
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
saison
style
lots
of
herbal
and
spicy
flavors
and
a
delicate
tartness
one
of
the
more
popular
stillwater
beers
a
great
drinking
beer
enjoyed
from
a
tap
mallet
pint
this
has
enough
character
to
be
discussed
yet
is
restrained
enough
to
enjoy
on
its
own
with
friends
this
could
easily
be
a
summer
staple
good
times
d
overall
this
is
a
really
wellmade
saison
with
the
white
sage
adding
a
whole
other
dimension
of
flavor
this
being
my
first
brew
from
stillwater
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
more
examples
this
one
wins
a
great
saison
id
buy
another
and
keep
it
til
the
dead
of
summer
d
a
nicely
different
rendition
good
basic
profile
and
style
points
with
a
very
deft
addition
of
sage
herbed
spiced
beers
can
be
hard
to
pull
off
in
an
attractive
and
highly
drinkable
fashion
this
one
pulls
it
off
nicely
with
sage
hops
yeast
all
merging
together
in
an
enjoyable
fashion
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
need
more
stillwater
products
on
the
shelves
in
columbia
tried
it
in
the
bottle
cellar
temp
and
the
beer
is
incredible
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
and
great
retention
and
tremendous
amounts
of
white
sediment
outstanding
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
light
orange
amber
massive
white
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
pleasant
aroma
of
yeast
citrus
sage
nice
flavor
of
wheat
light
malt
coriander
light
fruit
pear
and
apple
a
slight
hint
of
must
sage
adds
a
unique
flavor
and
hop
like
dry
kick
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
for
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
complex
and
very
refreshing
i
like
this
very
much
on
tap
at
sessions
in
greensboro
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
lightly
hazed
lemon
tinged
lighter
golden
with
a
large
fluffy
white
crown
that
lasted
for
almost
the
durationfresh
citric
hops
burst
out
in
the
aromas
along
with
light
white
pepperi
liked
the
fact
i
didnt
get
alot
of
funk
citric
hops
play
a
huge
role
on
the
palate
with
underlying
funk
and
that
white
peppera
light
sour
tang
came
in
the
finish
iam
not
a
saison
drinker
most
of
the
time
but
i
have
enjoyed
stillwaters
takes
i
have
had
of
the
style
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
yellow
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
sporadic
lacing
its
a
really
nice
looking
saison
thats
for
surethe
smell
is
spicey
herbal
aromas
mixed
with
tangerinewheat
and
orange
peelthe
mouthfeel
is
just
medium
bodied
and
really
does
suit
this
style
to
make
it
sessionable
while
still
being
flavoursome
with
tastes
of
tangerinelemon
zestearthy
spicesherbal
hops
and
finished
with
a
pleasant
grassy
spicy
dryness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
overall
its
a
niceflavoursomesessionable
drop
that
i
would
recommend
if
you
like
your
saisons
heavy
side
of
light
body
active
carbonation
drinks
well
minimal
abv
present
polished
off
the
whole
thing
easily
another
one
i
really
enjoyed
from
stillwater
taste
is
really
herbal
and
spicy
with
a
lot
of
sage
as
expected
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
really
tasty
and
easy
drinking
o
i
am
always
a
fan
of
saisons
and
this
one
is
no
exception
the
yeast
alcohol
and
grassiness
compliment
each
other
very
nicely
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
large
head
and
a
lace
ring
on
top
of
a
spicy
clovelike
aroma
full
of
yeastwheat
twang
light
citric
and
herbal
notes
as
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
but
it
is
also
fillingfluffy
from
the
yeast
crispness
is
pleasurable
not
a
deterrant
as
a
great
blend
of
citricherbal
hops
clove
spice
and
i
guess
sage
cant
really
tell
to
be
honest
blends
with
typical
light
saison
fruits
such
as
tropical
label
says
tangerine
more
like
pear
green
apple
and
there
is
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
beer
and
while
at
6
its
not
an
alkie
bomb
that
6
is
nowhere
noticeable
and
this
is
a
great
sessionable
ale
that
finishes
so
dry
and
easy
climbing
the
learning
curve
for
the
style
and
given
how
enjoyable
this
one
was
i
cant
wait
to
try
others
overy
good
i
think
i
prefer
it
over
the
stateside
but
both
were
quality
saisons
the
herbal
and
hop
flavors
in
this
one
were
a
little
more
interesting
both
capture
that
great
summery
quality
that
makes
saisons
so
enjoyable
purchased
on
a
recent
trip
to
st
louis
no
freshness
info
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
a
huge
white
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
to
form
nice
patches
of
foam
which
linger

with
some

and
peppery
notes
hint
of
grass
and
floral
elements
m
smooth
medium
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
but
a
very
pleasing
aroma
and
flavor
highly
recommended
o
a
memorable
saison
loaded
with
unique
sage
character
i
need
to
pair
this
with
food
asap
o
mostly
subtle
flavors
going
on
without
the
big
barnyard
yeastiness
im
used
to
for
the
style
very
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
and
could
be
used
as
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
overall
a
pretty
interesting
beer
the
white
sage
is
very
present
but
not
overwhelming
well
balanced
but
still
pretty
complex
overall
pretty
drinkable
brew
still
on
the
fence
with
this
one
but
not
bad
keep
up
the
good
work
stillwater
this
has
a
fantastic
aroma
and
a
great
bouquet
of
flavor
the
body
is
medium
but
can
be
very
slightly
watery
overall
really
good
not
loving
the
sage
thought
it
was
a
weird
choice
and
it
worked
better
then
i
expected
adding
some
earthy
notes
to
compliment
the
spiciness
of
the
yeast
no
off
flavors
to
mention
oa
good
example
of
an
american
farmhouse
ale
a
nice
balance
of
american
hops
sterlingcitra
sage
and
yeast
phenolics
malt
and
wheat
are
evident
no
hot
alcohols
a
rather
filling
farmhouse
ale
would
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
crisp
and
effervescent
but
good
none
the
less
taste
explodes
with
carbonation
and
fills
the
mouth
way
too
much
carbonation
citrus
peels
takes
the
front
of
the
flavor
yeasty
spiciness
hits
the
sides
of
the
tongue
finishes
semidry
and
refreshing
swirling
out
some
of
the
carbonation
helps
shared
this
bottle
with
a
nonbeer
geek
more
of
a
wine
enthusiast
and
he
loved
it
intriguing
tasty
drinkable
impressive
quite
good
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
gets
me
excited
by
beer
again

of
clover
honey
smells
like
sage
and
clementine
peels
tastes
like
kissing
the
clementine
eater
with
a
cracker
crisp
finish
thin
and
gently
effervescent
mouthfeel
brightly
herbal
and
beautifully
balanced
i
had
this
in
a
flight
last
night
and
really
quite
enjoyed
it
of
the
four
samples
this
one
had
the
most
characternotes
of
citrus
chardonnay
thistle
and
pine
and
it
come
thruogh
in
both
the
nose
and
even
carbonated
mouthfeel
i
have
heard
good
things
about
this
brewery
and
based
on
this
example
of
their
stuff
i
am
going
to
be
trying
some
more
and
hopefully
on
tap
overall
a
very
good
light
refreshing
belgiany
ale
technically
an
american
farmhouse
ale
which
i
think
is
more
like
a
saisonnot
sure
if
this
is
belgian
or
french
originally
i
am
enjoying
it
very
much
right
now
listening
to
thelonious
monk
but
would
be
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
mouth
feel
is
spot
on
again
the
carbonation
is
definitely
present
but
it
does
not
distract
from
the
beer
at
all
another
home
run
from
stillwater
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
a
little
richer
and
spicier
than
i
like
from
a
sessional
beer
but
still
delicious
was
the
perfect
compliment
to
the
fresh
oysters
baked
brownfeller
in
the
shell
and
pasta
olio
we
paired
it
with
overall
i
really
liked
this
take
on
the
saison
and
enjoyed
the
surprise
o
very
impressed
with
this
one
certainly
would
pair
well
with
food
and
certainly
is
creative
and
inspiring
another
winner
from
stillwater
almost
a
good
beer
with
a
lovely
bunch
of
adds
to
what
is
usually
a
fairly
staid
dull
style
for
me
i
like
whats
going
on
here
ill
grab
other
stillwater
beers
if
they
continue
to
show
up
across
the
river
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
smells
great
but
the
taste
fell
a
bit
flat
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
into
this
tulip
glass
smells
of
spice
and
sage
tastes
about
the
same
with
some
citrus
faint
spice
and
a
strong
piney
sage
punch
after
taste
is
a
lingering
citrus
and
sage
i
like
this
one
a
lot
its
easy
drinking
and
very
refreshing
a
decent
saison
but
not
particularly
memorable
fruity
in
the
nose
spicy
in
the
mouth
and
bubbly
all
around
poured
a
bright
hazy
orange
with
a
fluffy
bright
white
head
several
fingers
in
height
sticky
lace
and
great
retention
nose
has
citrus
zest
tangerine
orange
and
lemon
wheat
and
some
pale
malts
a
touch
of
funk
and
some
herbal
spicing
as
well
sage
perhaps
as
the
label
indicates
its
addition
taste
has
bright
herbal
spicing
as
per
the
nose
more
citrus
zest
lemon
and
tangerine
wheat
and
a
little
more
funk
some
spicing
in
the
finish
but
the
citra
hops
are
well
displayed
here
quite
light
in
the
mouthfeel
smooth
with
a
light
bite
imparted
by
the
carbonation
an
excellent
saison
i
really
enjoyed
this
certainly
the
best
saison
ive
had
in
recent
memory
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
ive
had
from
this
brewer
so
glad
i
picked
up
the
chardonay
barrel
aged
version
to
compare
it
too
might
have
to
save
that
for
the
warmer
months
a
very
nice
farmhouse
ale
from
stillwater
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
for
me
the
flavour
here
is
not
quite
right
its
very
dry
and
fruity
without
the
spice
and
hop
on
the
palate
of
the
classic
saisons
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
slightly
hazy
pretty
solar
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
malty
aroma
has
a
decided
overtone
of
sage
oh
yes
you
can
smell
that
and
it
makes
this
beer
all
the
more
appealing
ok
on
to
tasting
yummy
malty
fruity
earthy
with
that
sage
overtone
that
makes
it
distinctive
notes
of
banana
and
pear
enhance
the
sweetness
without
making
it
too
sweet
i
do
not
like
beer
that
is
oversweet
body
is
about
average
but
it
is
fairly
fizzy
and
leaves
a
nice
malty
finish
with
an
overtone
of
that
sage
get
it
whilst
thou
canst
o
nice

overall
very
nice
a
bit
boozy
especially
for

but
otherwise
tasty
interesting
nice
spices
a
lets
start
off
saying
this
is
one
of
the
sweetest
bottles
of
all
time
imo
pours
a
golden
honey
color
transparent
big
head
falls
to
a
light
ring
and
is
very
active
yeast
in
the
nose
light
lemon

more
citrus

with
a
subtle
bitterness
very
crisp
grassy
lemony
mint
very
good
tasting
beer
more
of
funk
is
desired
medium
to
light
body
very
prickly
on
the
palate
active
carbonation
overall
solid
and
very
refreshing
like
the
fruity
aspects
that
compliment
the
crisp
sharp
farmhouse
charcteristics
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
leaving
behind
just
a
few
bubbles
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
fresh
grains
belgian
yeast
and
some
light
lemon
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
has
a
light
farmhouse
flavor
to
it
with
just
a
little
bit
of
citrus
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
fresh
feeling
lively
carbonation
overall
the
this
is
a
good
brew
very
drinkable
stuff
here
poured
into
a
tulip
comes
out
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
theres
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
i
pick
up
a
strong
sage
aroma
with
some
piney
notes
the
sage
comes
through
on
the
palate
sharp
and
distinct
very
effervescent
its
piney
or
perhaps
more
accurately
rosemaryy
yes
rosemary
although
i
dont
think
its
brewed
with
it
i
catch
a
little
bit
of
chew
on
the
finish
with
a
residual
aftertaste
not
chew
as
in
tobacco
chew
as
in
chewy
theres
some
funk
at
the
end
as
well
makes
me
wonder
how
it
would
develop
with
time
this
beer
doesnt
disappointfar
from
it
but
its
not
the
repeat
of
the
transcendent
experience
i
was
hoping
for
od
a
pretty
crisp
drinkable
farmhouse
ale
complex
in
the
taste
department
kind
of
refreshing
but
the
savory
finish
impedes
a
bit
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
kind
of
nice
with
this
leftover
watermelon
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
dry
clean
finish
this
is
a
classic
saison
water
also
seems
to
be
a
key
ingredient
with
this
one
o
this
is
a
top
notch
saison
very
deep
and
complex
but
also
quite
refreshing
stillwater
may
be
the
new
kid
on
the
block
but
they
know
what
theyre
doing
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
but
it
wont
be
an
everyday
drinker
for
me
o
very
happy
i
picked
this
one
up
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
into
the
farmhouse
style
a
nicely
balanced
crisp
fresh
farmhouse
ale
with
a
fantastic
clean
finish
conclusion
this
saison
wont
hurt
you
with
alcohol
bite
or
yeast
twang
but
it
isnt
a
domesticated
example
of
this
varied
style
either
i
like
the
textured
flavors
and
balance
of
oldworld
style
with
hops
and
spices
certainly
worth
you
while
and
your
money
if
you
have
any
interest
in
this
style
of
ale
d
this
was
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
with
super
complex
delicate
and
delicious
scent
and
taste
nice
body
for
the
style
and
low
alcohol
so
quite
easy
to
drink
but
should
be
sipped
to
savor
not
for
aging
highly
recommended
the
feel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
seems
to
be
somewhat
coating
on
the
pallet
though
overall
id
say
this
one
hits
the
spot
for
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
very
well
done
drinkability
the
spice
note
mingles
so
nicely
with
the
lemony
citra
hop
note
it
adds
such
a
unique
edge
to
this
beer
that
keeps
your
interest
throughout
i
wish
there
was
more
behind
the
spice
but
the
dry
finish
combined
with
everything
else
in
the
flavor
is
enough
to
pull
me
back
in
a
very
enjoyable
quaff
super
solid
and
super
quality
in
every
aspect
this
is
my
first
stillwater
beer
and
im
now
officially
anxious
to
try
more
overall
this
is
a
cash
money
saison
wish
it
was
available
here
because
i
would
crush
this
on
the
reg
all
summer
long
this
was
intended
to
be
a
gift
for
a
friend
until
it
started
gushing
in
the
back
of
my
car
on
the
way
home
truthfully
im
glad
i
had
this
all
to
myself
this
is
quite
a
nice
saison
it
is
certainly
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
that
just
adds
to
the
character
the
balance
towards
rough
is
caused
by
the
ample
hop
character
that
i
am
quite
enjoying
so
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
the
hops
to
be
reduced
in
order
to
make
this
softer
rounder
this
is
definitely
my
type
of
americanized
saison
overall
honestly
i
am
not
crazy
about
this
one
if
the
sage
was
turned
down
a
bit
i
would
like
this
better
and
i
generally
enjoy
off
the
wall
spices
in
my
beers
probably
wont
get
this
again
but
will
definitely
continue
to
explore
stillwater
any
brewer
that
specializes
in
saisons
is
fine
by
me
hybrids
are
great
and
this
is
very
nice
one
very
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
it
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
farmhouse
ale
i
would
purchase
again
recommended
overall
nice
and
complex
many
tastes
that
blend
well
make
for
an
outstanding
saison
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
from
this
brewery
overall
another
very
good
saison
from
stillwater
that
no
one
should
hesitate
from
buying
opening
the
cellar
door
reveals
a
depth
of
flavor
the
mining
of
which
delivers
new
notes
each
time
it
could
be
dryer
but
as
far
as
americanmade
saisons
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
cellar
door
has
carbonation
and
creaminess
in
spades
in
fact
the
flaw
of
its
mouthfeel
lies
in
having
to
much
of
these
things
swish
the
beer
around
in
your
mouth
and
it
foams
up
it
thickens
into
a
slightly
tooheafty
beer
while
the
carbonation
is
slightly
too
overactive
the
entire
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
dr
pepper
in
this
way
overall
this
is
a
darn
good
saison
it
smells
and
tastes
quite
fresh
and
floral
its
brewed
conventionally
for
the
style
but
manages
to
come
across
as
quite
traditional
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
iterations
of
the
saison
style
pours
a
murky
yellow
not
great
but
fine
for
the
style
things
take
off
from
there
spices
aboundginger
in
particular
where
did
this
come
from
the
label
says
it
is
brewed
with
sage
perhaps
it
is
the
power
of
suggestion
as
more
herbal
notes
flow
rosemary
sage
coriander
there
is
a
twang
in
the
nose
like
a
sour
onthevergeofspoiling
flavor
i
love
it
it
is
not
an
acetic
sour
but
a
sourmash
type
aroma
pale
malts
abound
and
the
beer
satisfies
and
still
suggests
more
sips
with
each
swallow
hard
to
get
enough
aromatic
herb
garden
aromas
linger
on
the
tongue
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
drinkability
is
great
im
absolutely
loving
this
brew
the
use
of
sage
as
an
adjunct
is
a
total
homerun
and
really
plays
well
with
the
base
saison
o
this
is
a
really
good
saison
the
nose
is
great
and
the
flavour
is
similarly
good
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
it
did
not
disappoint
12
is
steep
for
a
750
but
its
worth
it
for
this
wonderful
saison
really
enjoyed
this
beer
sage
was
subtle
enough
my
favorite
from
them
so
far
jd
a
great
tasting
farmhouse
brew
750ml
bottle
from
total
wine
tempe
pour
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
white
head
aroma
has
sage
lemon
and
some
wheat
taste
is
sweet
that
follows
the
aroma
after
having
saison
du
buff
i
was
concerned
that
the
sage
would
be
overpowering
but
they
use
finesse
here
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
light
bitter
finish
nice
job
with
using
the
sage
and
balancing
it
with
the
saison
characteristics
edit
holy
cow
that
was
delicious
i
highly
recommend
pairing
this
with
steamers
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
though
its
fairly
far
from
a
traditional
saison
refreshing
and
worth
a
shot
another
winner
from
stillwater
this
would
make
for
a
nice
table
beer
also
aroma
is
mostly
composed
of
citrus
fruits
saison
yeast
grainy
malts
some
slight
funk
earthy
hops
also
in
the
nose
flavor
is
has
a
grainy
bready
malt
sweetness
citrus
twang
and
gives
way
to
sage
no
surprise
there
in
the
finish
apples
pears
and
bitter
earthy
hops
throughout
the
flavor
as
well
well
balanced
saision
creamy
and
almost
chewy
on
the
tongue
glad
i
discovered
this
brewery
solid
beer
o
this
beer
has
a
sage
quality
that
is
fresh
and
stronger
than
the
other
flavors
but
as
it
opens
up
the
yeast
character
starts
to
develop
around
the
sage
and
really
adds
some
nice
depth
to
the
beer
it
is
too
bad
that
is
was
so
carbonated
but
it
was
worth
the
wait
d
very
nicely
done
the
spice
character
is
subtle
enough
that
it
blends
in
with
the
yeast
and
adds
complexity
to
the
beer
without
turning
it
into
soup
there
is
plenty
of
smooth
flavorful
malt
in
the
background
to
keep
the
spice
and
hop
elements
in
check
the
dry
finish
keeps
things
drinkable
and
the
complexity
makes
it
easy
for
me
to
finish
the
bottle
by
myself
despite
the
somewhat
excessive
serving
size
really
clean
and
full
of
complex
notes
great
beer
to
try
instead
of
a
hoppy
pilsner
on
a
warm
evening
cloudy
dark
yellow
and
burnt
orange
saison
with
a
tremendous
white
head
lacing
the
glass
and
the
beer
aroma
is
unreal
pineapple
mango
tangerines
and
a
dozen
other
citrusy
and
floral
aromas
passion
fruits
and
candied
watermelon
take
over
the
taste
though
the
brew
is
not
overly
sweet
slight
bit
of
tang
mixed
in
to
keep
the
beer
balanced
a
fully
realized
brew
expertly
crafted
from
top
to
bottom
a
must
try
edit
just
read
the
label
and
it
says
it
was
brewed
with
white
sage
sunshine
in
a
glass
t
flavors
of
clover
honey
rich
caramel
malt
and
citric
hops
the
finish
is
bitter
herbaceous
and
hoppy
light
orange
color
with
decent
white
foamy
head
that
eventually
turns
into
a
film
on
top
smell
is
powerfully
full
of
belgian
spices
and
with
some
citrus
taste
is
has
a
strong
herbal
presence
with
spices
and
some
pop
from
something
that
tastes
reminiscent
of
green
peppers
strangely
also
some
more
citrus
there
very
dry
incredibly
light
bodied
i
really
enjoy
this
one
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
though
the
tap
version
seems
to
offer
more
distinct
flavors
that
set
it
apart
and
just
above
the
bottle
hazy
straw
out
of
the
bottle
in

after

i
like
pairing

with

more
than

in
the
saison
nice
though
poured
into

a
golden

for
quite
a
while
pours
a
semihazy
honeygold
with
a
rocky
three
inch
bright
white
head
that
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
slowly
recedes
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
embedded
with
tiny
pinpricks
some
lacing
but
no
legs
nose
is
herbal
and
grassy
sage
presents
up
front
followed
by
citrus
and
a
trace
of
cut
grass
all
and
all
fairly
clean
for
a
farmhouse
taste
follows
nose
however
citrus
comes
out
initially
with
the
sage
expressing
itself
more
towards
the
finish
something
else
is
also
happening
towards
the
middle
i
get
a
trace
of
sweetness
perhaps
candi
sugar
in
addition
to
the
grassy
quality
the
mouthfeel
on
this
somewhat
kills
it
for
me
carbonation
is
extremely
gassy
body
is
lightmedium
and
theres
a
definite
prickliness
that
is
partially
attributable
to
the
carbonation
as
well
as
the
citrus
acidity
finish
is
semidry
a
quality
and
complex
domestic
saison
however
the
carbonation
is
way
too
assertive
and
really
detracts
from
the
taste
if
the
carbonation
was
more
under
control
id
probably
score
this
in
the
high
b
to
low
a
range
d
moderate
its
a
nice
beer
that
is
well
balanced
o
stillwaters
cellar
door
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
consumed
its
jam
packed
with
flavorful
and
perfectly
balanced
nuances
that
will
bring
me
back
to
it
again
and
again
this
is
a
big
league
beer
seek
it
out
and
enjoy
i
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
have
the
chance
even
with
a
high
price
tag
its
flavors
are
both
appealing
and
sophisticated
a
good
place
to
start
to
try
stillwater
25
oz
bottles
may
be
more
reasonably
priced
if
you
find
them
will
be
looking
for
more
heavy
on
the
spice
this
one
is
it
would
probably
pair
well
with
a
thanksgiving
turkey
but
its
a
bit
much
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
o
overall
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
ever
had
my
first
taste
of
this
brew
was
at
a
beer
festival
where
beers
were
judged
and
rated
and
this
one
got
first
place
and
was
the
clear
standout
it
was
the
battle
of
the
belgians
and
this
beer
was
the
standout
sidebyside
with
the
classics
keep
an
eye
on
stillwater
one
of
the
best
brewers
out
there
unique
and
original
and
tasty
beyond
this
is
one
of
my
fav
brews
nice
beer
for
spring
and
steal
change
from
what
ive
bee
drinking
lately
havent
seen
this
one
close
tomhome
but
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
again
dirtybeerguy
com
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
im
impressed
by
this
brewery
nice
packaging
too
d
didnt
notice
the
sage
on
first
sniff
so
i
checked
the
spice
cabinet
to
see
if
white
sage
was
any
different
than
the
sage
in
the
spice
rack
next
sniff
was
overpowering
sage
that
never
really
went
away
interesting
beer
but
and
i
really
like
the
herb
idea
in
a
saison
but
i
was
sick
of
sage
by
the
end
of
the
beer
poured
a
capped
750ml
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
super
hazy
almost
white
yellow
with
a
big
massive
4inch
cap
that
leaves
heavy
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
has
as
nice
herbal
aroma
up
front
while
i
cant
particularly
taste
sage
it
reminds
me
of
almost
a
basilrosemary
blend
a
nice
wheat
tang
follows
with
a
earthy
mustiness
at
the
very
tail
end
of
the
aroma
comes
a
nice
floral
pick
me
up
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
the
mustiness
is
a
bit
more
prevalent
then
in
the
aroma
nice
herbal
flavor
but
not
overpower
like
it
is
in
several
beers
the
sage
is
balanced
with
a
nice
floral
hopping
a
bit
of
wet
grass
and
just
a
bit
of
aspirin
really
tasty
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
of
a
saison
is
what
makes
or
breaks
the
beer
you
can
have
a
saison
that
tastes
great
but
finishes
sweet
and
full
and
it
just
falls
completely
flat
this
gets
it
right
it
finishes
nice
and
dry
leaving
you
tongue
feeling
like
you
just
sucked
on
a
piece
of
sandpaper
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
glad
to
have
another
fantastic
saison
available
in
the
state
o
a
nice
beer
and
very
enjoyable
some
flavors
seem
to
clash
some
but
not
too
much
nice
complexity
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
o
judging
by
previous
reviews
i
obviously
didnt
like
this
one
as
much
as
many
others
on
ba
however
i
understand
why
they
did
and
i
respect
that
as
for
me
the
intense
spices
covered
up
the
farmhouse
element
too
much
for
my
taste
many
thanks
to
finewinemike
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
saison
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
style
beers
and
im
eager
to
try
this
one
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
rush
of
frothy
white
cloudlike
foam
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
foam
takes
awhile
to
dissipate
and
crackles
down
to
leave
a
thin
foam
top
on
the
beer
awesome
visual
so
far
smell
lemon
zest
cracked
pepper
a
tart
fruit
scent
with
some
really
nice
bready
farmhouse
flavors
intense
flavors
taste
sweet
bread
lemon
clove
pepper
faint
coriander
very
true
to
the
style
love
this
beer
mouthfeel
awesome
carbonation
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
had
very
impressive
this
is
a
great
american
made
saison
that
was
a
bit
more
herbal
and
spicy
than
i
would
necessarily
like
but
it
was
still
very
enjoyable
i
bet
that
the
carbonation
level
and
dry
spicy
nature
would
make
this
an
amazing
beer
to
pair
with
all
sorts
of
cheese
definitely
pick
this
up
i
love
the
mindset
of
this
brewery
and
will
be
looking
for
more
in
the
future
d
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
american
saisons
since
they
tend
to
overuse
the
exotic
spices
and
make
me
feel
like
im
drinking
perfume
this
one
is
pretty
decent
though
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
enjoy
the
combo
of
sage
and
saison
the
blend
is
very
nice
d
another
great
saison
from
stillwater
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
stateside
but
pretty
close
2
5
d
i
dont
understand
how
the
stillwater
saisons
got
hyped
this
and
stateside
are
both
pretty
mediocre
not
really
anything
good
about
this
other
than
the
appearance
d
a
good
beer
but
nothing
amazing
their
beers
are
all
good
but
nothing
so
great
that
i
would
really
want
to
stock
up
finish
is
layers
of
the
flavor
that
has
a
strong
sage
finish
quite
complex
layered
and
appealing
d
it
was
really
big
on
the
herbal
character
which
to
me
made
it
a
little
bit
harder
to
drink
but
was
a
decent
saison

bit
of

as
well
very
drinkable
sage
is
present
but
not
in
your
face
interesting
beer
drinkability
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
poured
half
of
it
out
a
new
beer
to
the
area
im
excited
to
try
some
gypsy
farmhouse
saison
handsome
golden
orange
slightly
cloudy
excellent
head
with
some
life
to
it
very
impressive
and
inviting
beautiful
aromas
fruity
yeast
apples
dry
herbal
notes
slight
farmhouse
earth
funk
and
nice
dusty
hops
much
the
same
represented
in
the
flavor
nice
fruityness
and
substance
but
nice
dry
finish
the
sage
is
nice
and
balanced
adding
to
the
compexity
but
not
jumbled
or
overpowering
fluffy
and
prickly
mouthfeel
full
and
luscious
yet
crisp
and
refreshing
damn
near
perfect
this
makes
for
an
excellently
fun
beer
to
drink
lots
of
flavors
coming
at
you
from
around
the
corner
in
an
easily
enjoyable
package
very
tasty
looking
forward
to
trying
their
other
beers
blech
very
well
made
and
unique
one
of
the
best
saisons
i
think
ive
ever
had
very
drinkable
excellent
saison
d
really
good
d
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
and
interesting
flavors
ok
job
but
not
my
fave
saison
drinkability
is
pretty
high
with
this
one
its
light
and
crisp
and
goes
down
easy
lots
of
complex
aromas
and
flavors
going
on
throughout
has
me
thinking
itd
be
a
great
beer
for
a
warmer
summer
day
d
i
had
a
glass
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
but
it
again
too
much
spice
and
too
bubbly
for
my
liking
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
sure
why
there
is
so
my
buzz
for
this
one
6

abv
had
a
bomber
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
at
smith
commons
in
dc
24
this
wheatbased
saision
gave
off
an
orangy
gold
and
crisp
appearance
with
a
nice
foam
head
smelled
sweet
yet
bitter
taste
was
wheaty
and
i
could
pick
up
hints
of
white
sage
and
blends
of
herbal
grass
and
citrus
hops
mouthability
was
light
and
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
throughout
drinkability
was
pleasant
and
would
fit
late
springsummer
session
drinking
better
for
me
this
beautiful
blonde
saison
pours
excitable
like
any
good
farmhouse
should
it
is
brewed
with
white
sage
which
gives
it
a
very
earthly
pineapple
essence
kind
of
like
the
smell
of
a
bells
hopslam
wafting
through
a
third
level
dream
in
inception
subtle
yeast
with
a
tangy
carbonation
that
is
like
jumping
out
of
bed
on
a
warm
spring
morning
to
welcome
the
sun
the
breeze
and
the
early
summer
pollens
it
is
wonderful
to
drink
and
highly
recommended
to
a
saison
drinker
who
would
like
introduce
this
thirstqueching
style
to
the
uninitiated
liked
this
alot
not
overly
aggressivenor
alcoholic
a
pretty
drinkable
saison
d
the
citrus
gave
me
the
worst
beer
heartburn
of
all
time
hugely
citric
without
much
of
a
funky
or
twangy
wheat
quality
i
can
see
why
people
might
like
this
especially
saison
lovers
as
a
change
of
pace
drinkability
good
d
this
beer
needs
to
be
sipped
rather
slowly
given
the
strength
of
the
sage
in
the
taste
although
its
certainly
unique
so
i
could
consider
having
it
again
the
soft
and
balanced
nose
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
but
overall
its
a
nice
farmhouse
ale
nice
blend
of
perfumy
phenolic
spicy
and
citrusy
elements
would
probably
be
a
particularly
tasty
beer
in
the
heat
of
summer
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
white
head
head
retention
is
pretty
good
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
citrus
lemon
peel
tropical
fruit
and
peppery
and
herbal
spice
which
i
assume
is
partly
from
the
white
sage
in
this
beer
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
lime
and
a
bit
of
wheat
overall
taste
is
citrusy
and
herbal
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
crisp
and
has
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
the
soft
carbonation
helps
make
this
brew
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
id
definitely
buy
this
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
would
be
a
daily
drinker
for
me
in
the
summer
a
very
well
crafted
saison
this
beer
was
one
of
the
more
remarkable
beers
ive
tried
in
the
past
few
months
intense
notes
of
white
sage
knocked
my
socks
off
really
a
fantastic
flavoring
the
beer
only
loses
points
for
taking
that
taste
a
little
bit
too
far
if
this
were
a
little
bit
more
subtle
it
would
surely
make
my
top
10
as
is
its
fantastic
and
incredibly
memorable
this
is
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
like
a
saison
a
lot
of
zing
and
well
carbonated
would
make
a
nice
braising
liquid
for
poultry
lemonsage
however
my
taste
may
have
been
skewed
as
i
had
just
finished
a
heavy
seas
great
pumpkin
which
was
much
sweeter
and
spicier
by
contrast
i
will
give
it
a
go
again
if
its
still
in
maxs
rotation
and
rereview
poured
a
massive
white
head
which
took
forever
to
dissipate
to
18
hazy
lemon
merengue
color
looks
quite
lovely
held
up
to
the
light
smells
like
a
nice
belgian
beer
alright
taste
has
a
rich
and
savery
aspect
which
no
doubt
ties
somewhat
to
the
sage
used
although
i
cant
exactly
say
in
a
blind
taste
test
id
have
guessed
sage
overall
the
richness
reminded
me
of
a
mild
ipa
though
not
nearly
as
hoppy
good
beer
pricey
but
good
maybe
a
bit
too
spicy
to
tackle
a
bottle
solo
but
a
great
one
to
share
and
pair
with
food
this
one
was
well
worth
seeking
out
color
is
a
hazy
tangerine
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
looks
effervescent
almost
to
the
extent
of
a
champagne
bubble
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
blooming
flowers
pear
slight
banana
clove
hibiscus
honeysuckle
honey
and
star
anise
almost
smells
like
a
mix
between
a
belgian
pale
and
a
spiced
hefeweizen
the
taste
is
earthy
grass
with
a
slight
bit
of
spice
there
is
a
yeasty
pepperyness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
barnyard
funk
some
light
herb
flavors
also
come
through
on
the
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
foamy
to
the
point
where
i
need
to
let
the
beer
sit
in
my
mouth
for
a
while
to
lose
some
of
the
carbonation
fairly
complex
and
a
decent
saison
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
would
prefer
a
few
belgian
examples
over
this
at
the
price
point
i
can
drink
beers
like
this
pretty
easily
but
ultimately
i
think
i
want
a
little
more
from
saisons
though
its
certainly
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
drinking
but
id
more
than
likely
reach
for
other
saisons
first
cheers
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
saison
du
buff
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
an
oversized
pinot
noir
glass
can
i
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
looking
bottle
labels
of
all
time
huge
overflowing
4
fingers
of
bubbly
champagnelike
head
receds
fairly
quickly
with
some
ok
lacing
nice
golden
color
smells
peppery
herbalicious
a
little
like
my
friend
adams
apartment
in
burbank
some
sort
of
sour
funk
going
on
nice
example
of
a
saison
on
the
tongue
citrus
pepper
earthiness
and
herbs
mouthfeel
is
very
champagnelike
crisp
on
my
tongue
and
very
dry
drinkable
as
hell
as
all
saisons
should
be
looking
forward
to
more
stillwater
beers
extremely
delicate
and
openly
knit
head
crests
at
about
two
fingers
of
bleached
white
but
dissolves
faster
than
carl
lewis
running
the
100
meters
has
some
lacing
but
this
is
fairly
momentary
too
light
yellowish
color
with
some
orange
to
it
looks
kinda
like
an
adjunct
lager
strong
beads
visible
within
clean
hued
consistently
white
pepper
clove
coriander
filled
nose
with
an
abundance
of
orange
peel
and
blossom
a
whole
lot
of
poached
apricot
going
on
supplemented
by
ripe
peach
green
melon
and
pear
scents
baking
glaze
and
pie
flakes
right
amount
of
yeastiness
with
mustiness
the
florality
remains
subordinate
to
the
spice
lavender
and
lilacs
more
stickiness
in
the
nostrils
than
lift
full
and
extended
presence
fullbodied
here
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
able
to
relieve
some
unnecessary
weight
and
bring
tingle
to
the
tongue
drier
feel
brings
the
apricot
back
to
earth
woven
into
the
nectarine
pineapple
peach
yellow
apple
fruit
juicy
but
not
possessed
of
tropical
bite
pepper
marjoram
sage
bay
leaves
there
as
well
as
something
close
to
wasabi
the
tangerine
tangelo
citrus
lively
but
dry
too
clean
for
substantial
earthiness
or
yeastiness
to
accumulate
cherry
and
a
brush
of
honey
reverberate
through
the
finish
cant
exactly
relax
while
sipping
it
conversely
not
sweating
you
either
drinkability
is
certainly
good
though
not
quite
as
exceptional
as
the
flavor
and
aroma
aspects
the
complexity
alone
makes
this
an
eminently
satisfying
beer
after
only
a
glass
or
two
and
the
mouthfeel
takes
a
bit
of
adjustment
this
shouldnt
take
away
from
what
is
clearly
a
great
beer
however
wow
fabulous
beer
look
out
belgium
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
poured
with
a
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
that
lasts
and
good
lace
color
is
a
hazy
amber
aroma
is
a
pungent
blend
of
yeast
malt
fruit
grass
earth
and
fresh
cut
hay
flavor
is
similar
with
the
carbonic
acid
yeast
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
prominant
body
is
perfect
for
this
beer
finish
has
the
more
extreme
qualities
dropping
off
quick
and
the
more
balanced
and
milder
qualities
with
a
slower
taper
to
a
medium
length
session
beer
if
i
got
the
cash
on
hand
drinkability
its
nice
to
find
an
american
made
saison
thats
not
overdone
with
malt
leaving
it
flabby
and
sweet
or
even
worse
overdone
with
spice
or
yeast
character
this
one
shows
refinement
and
superb
balance
its
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
offers
enough
complexity
and
character
to
keep
it
going
certainly
worth
trying
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
had
from
the
stillwater
artisanal
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
pale
yellow
foamy
head
floral
notes
not
overly
sweet
a
slight
hop
great
finish
i
am
also
not
a
huge
fan
of
saison
style
beers
i
have
been
warming
up
to
them
i
tend
to
like
the
saison
styles
brew
in
the
united
states
rather
than
belgium
this
beer
is
good
d
a
flavor
profile
this
rich
and
only

amazing
this
is
my
favorite
stillwater
offering
and
one
of
the
best
saisons
that
ive
ever
had
d
drinks
very
nicely
could
go
through
a
few
of
these
if
it
were
more
readily
available
very
well
crafted
example
of
the
style
though
still
a
distinctly
domestic
rendition
considering
the
hop
character
and
use
of
herbs
i
believe
this
is
another
unique
take
on
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
along
with
saint
somewhere
i
am
starting
to
appreciate
breweries
that
attempt
to
expand
this
style
using
unconventional
ingredients
case
in
point
this
saison
is
very
drinkable
and
i
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
may
get
bored
with
the
usual
versions
of
this
style
that
are
available
despite
some
confusion
on
who
and
what
is
actually
brewing
this
stuff
it
comes
through
as
pretty
damn
rightous
notes
another
nice
serving
from
stillwater
solid
all
around
with
a
nice
and
prominent
touch
of
sage
not
having
much
of
an
opportunity
to
catch
it
on
tap
or
cask
around
the
region
it
is
great
to
see
the
bottles
around
now
and
then
overall
this
was
everything
everyone
told
me
it
would
be
and
more
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
just
done
right
a
great
refreshing
taste
and
crisp
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
makes
this
eminently
drinkable
i
think
brian
strumke
has
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
this
one
hard
pour
into
my
tulip
brings
a
fivefinger
head
that
eventually
recedes
down
into
a
fairly
constant
singlefinger
layer
although
it
only
leaves
the
tiniest
bit
of
lacing
behind
nose
brings
forth
a
tiny
amount
of
earth
and
hay
along
with
a
nice
lemon
presence
a
little
bit
hoppy
taste
is
quite
the
same
with
a
bit
of
lemony
grass
and
some
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
a
bit
undercarbonated
drinks
pretty
well
but
is
lacking
the
type
of
depth
i
expect
for
saisons
pours
a
beautiful
golden
yellow

a
few
inches
of
silky
fluffy
head
surprisingly
little
lacing

aromas
of
fresh
cut
flowers
sage
and
crushed
mint
leaves
stand
out
with
a
hint
of
tart
citrus
slightly
sour
wheat
flavors
complement
the
initial
wave
of
pale
malt
flavors
well
these
flavors
provide
a
solid
base
for
the
herbaceousfloral
notes
that
follow
black
pepper
white
sage
fresh
cut
grass
and
grapefruity
citra
hops
the
citrus
notes
follow
through
the
light
spritzy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
this
beer
truly
great
peppery
and
bracing
on
the
tongue
but
soft
and
delicate
in
the
finish
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
wheat
malt
some
earthy
herbs
and
grass
and
hops
has
a
nice
crisp
hoppy
finish
this
is
one
tasty
saison
golden

mild

something

the

is
quite
there
and
leaves
a
nice

on

is
misdirected
by
the

weissbock
very
good
saison
the
yeast
notes
seemed
a
bit
dominant
only
because
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
the
hops
a
touch
more
that
might
have
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
keg
the
herbs
were
a
nice
touch
the
sage
stuck
out
well
without
pushing
forward
too
much
stillwaters
saison
yeast
is
quite
good
dry
with
a
mild
barnyard
note
the
hops
were
citric
but
much
more
subtle
than
in
the
stateside
saison
which
i
prefer
the
beer
poured
hazy
and
light
gold
with
a
white
head
the
feel
was
appropriate
for
the
style
not
too
much
carbonation
and
fuller
than
the
abv
would
suggest
the
carbonation
is
gentle
but
feels
like
lots
of
small
bubbles
if
that
makes
sense
anyway
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers

of

the
herbal
pungency
of
sage
the
spiciness
of

quite

the
beer

this
is
a
very
enjoyable
draft

one
i
would
certainly
have
again
d
not
bad
but
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
it
very
much
moderately
refreshingjust
not
up
my
alley
as
far
as
saisons
go
highly
recommended
for
its
drinkability
d
goes
down
way
smooth
on
these
hot
summer
days
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
pouring
a
mildly
hazy
yellow
this
beer
has
a
nice
white
head
with
great
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
wonderful

is
prominent

a
nice
depth

appears
as
it
warms
up
with
some
honey

the
palate
opens
with
plenty
of

character
prominent
and
spicy
despite
its
strength
it
doesnt
get
tiring
as
it
warms
up
theres
a
very
enjoyable
honey
and
spice
note
that
comes
through
on
the
midpalate
drying
on
the
finish
this
does
feel
creamy
and
just
a
hair
overcarbonated
sage
lingers
on
the
finish
solid
stuff
this
is
a
beer
ive
had
a
couple
of
times
already
and
one
that
i
will
continue
to
revisit
had
a
draft
tulip
lass
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
pa
for
6
overall
the
beer
was
a
bit
sharp
and
overly
spicy
with
peppercorns
there
was
a
lovely
sweep
apricot
background
so
while
the
beer
was
a
bit
unrefined
it
was
still
interesting
and
plenty
tasty
give
it
a
shot
mouthfeel
is
peppery
herbal
and
lip
smacking
with
some
residual
sweetness
lingering
d
very
nice
stuff
im
dying
to
pair
with
some
food
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
nice
estery
breadiness
to
the
whole
thing
its
overall
smooth
and
light
and
finishes
nicely
id
be
interested
to
try
several
of
these
beers
side
by
side
i
want
a
bottle
of
this
so
i
can
have
it
next
to
the
other
stateside
saison
d
a
nice
saison
some
nice
fruit
and
spice
in
the
taste
would
try
again
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
though
i
prefer
the
french
oaked
version
either
way
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
stillwater
overall
this
is
my
first
hill
farmstead
beer
and
i
am
amazed
at
how
well
crafted
it
truly
is
if
i
had
not
just
ran
across
the
date
i
would
never
have
been
able
to
tell
that
it
had
over
a
year
of
age
on
the
bottle
super
beer
i
hope
this
is
the
first
of
many
opportunities
the
smell
and
the
taste
definitely
have
a
lemon
zest
quality
there
is
a
good
amount
of
sourness
which
im
guessing
became
more
pronounced
with
age
the
sourness
is
well
balanced
by
a
slight
sweetness
from
the
malt
its
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
i
would
trade
for
again
if
the
opportunity
arises
overall
i
am
not
huge
on
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
does
not
possess
the
medicinal
qualities
of
some
in
the
style
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
hill
farmstead
amazingly

overall
4

this
is
just
a
fantastically
crafted
beer
the
saison
style
is
a
broadranging
one
so
its
hard
to
compare
takes
on
the
style
that
can
be
quite
different
from
one
another
that
said
i
can
attest
that
this
particular
beer
more
than
lives
up
to
the
massive
reputation
that
precedes
hill
farmstead
its
the
quintessential
tart
farmhouse
ale
in
my
mind
quite
a
bit
more
tartness
than
i
anticipated
which
was
a
great
surprise
light
and
quenching
with
a
lovely
yeasty
complexity
some
florals
and
fresh
citrus
with
a
robust
barny
undertone
and
some
hoppy
spice
a
lovely
saison
and
i
will
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
balance
is
pretty
terrific
but
you
do
have
to
crave
the
acidic
tartness
soft
beer
with
balanced
hops
and
carbonation
this
would
be
a
great
warm
weather
beer
to
sit
by
the
pool
and
crush
all
day
long
overall
this
is
the
type
of
saison
that
is
right
up
my
alley
grainy
and
just
a
little
spicy
and
funky
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
tartness
my
favorite
saisons
have
that
tart
aspect
yet
keep
a
great
complexity
with
grain
and
funk
and
this
beer
has
all
of
those
qualities
mind
blown
mind
on
the
wall
like
earnest
hemingway
all
those
grassy
peppery
saison
flavors
but
with
a
dollop
of
the
most
glorious
citrus
possible
am
i
tripping
no
im
alive
not
tart
like
anna
and
florence
which
i
actually
dont
mind
as
its
a
saison
a
bit
one
dimensional
still
a
fantastic
saison
more
sour
than
saison
once
i
adjusted
it
was
quite
good
very
carbonated
overall
i
am
still
not
wowed
by
hf
but
this
is
a
very
solid
saison
first
off
i
am
not
a
saison
type
of
guy
but
i
try
to
review
true
to
style
and
not
personal
preference
so
if
i
was
a
saison
guy
and
this
was
my
style
of
choice
i
could
definitely
drink
this
with
ease
but
i
would
definitely
want
more
pepper
and
spice
in
the
brew
which
i
feel
this
was
lacking
a
bit
of
o
my
first
brew
from
hill
farmstead
with
nordic
in
the
fridge
very
delightful
brew
unlike
any
saison
ive
ever
had
enjoyed
the
short
but
informational
story
on
the
label
very
refreshing
starts
out
with
a
tart
lemony
flavor
and
saison
spices
follow
my
wife
didnt
like
it
so
a
750ml
was
a
bit
much
for
me
but
overall
a
great
ale
flavor
again
that
sour
flavor
kicks
more
flavors
of
lemon
then
that
applepear
drink
ill
keep
this
brief
so
crushable
easily
couldve
done
another
bottle
o
easily
the
best
saison
that
i
have
had
and
it
has
everything
i
want
in
one
what
a
treat
and
i
am
lucky
to
have
tried
it
now
i
want
more
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
is
worth
trying
has
all
the
things
youd
want
in
a
saison
lemon
and
citrus
notes
that
are
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
tastes
like
it
has
a
bit
of
funky
sour
going
on
too
highly
recommended
overall
drinking
like
always
citrusy
grassy
tart
dry
extremely
refreshing
one
of
those
saisons
you
cant
get
enough
of
drinks
way
too
smooth
overall
another
amazing
saison
from
hill
farmstead
so
refreshing
and
well
balanced
well
worth
seeking
out
o
an
outstanding
farmhouse
ale
not
my
usual
class
of
beer
but
im
now
a
convert
thanks
to
ari
for
taking
the
drive
and
gifting
me
the
bottle
seriously
refreshing
id
take
a
case
of
this
on
my
trek

that
had
a
nice
clarity
to
its
look
and
the
taste
was
unusual
would
highly
recommend
overall
great
some
nice
gueuzelike
qualities
but
still
a
saison
at
heart
good
balance
of
flavors
and
solid
all
around
probably
one
of
the
better
belgianstyle
ales
from
hf
for
me

the

less

something
of
a

in

in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
light

with
a
bright

tickles
the

and
a
slight
astringency
that
stimulates
the

a

batch
from
52014
poured
into
a
hill

stemmed

essentially
appearance
is
similar
hazy

yellow
body
with
a
nice
two

white
head
that
lingers
for
a
long
while
leaving
streaks
of

bready

peppery

and
quite
a
bit
more
funk
than
the
last
couple
batches
have
had
flavour
is
pretty
similar
there
is
also
a
nice
vinous
quality
to
it
that
complements
the
tartness
of
the
apple
skins
which
is
actually
tarter
than
previous
batches
which
im
enjoying
very
much
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
creamy
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
definitely
the
best
batch
of
arthur
versus
fall
2013
dont
recall
the
month
of
bottling
and
22014
in
particular
the
22014
bottling
needed
a
good
bit
of
time
to
reach
the
levels
that
52014
is
drinking
at
right
now
no
bells
and
whistles
here
folks
and
none
are
needed
arthur
is
a
tremendously
well
made
american
saison
with
all
the
qualities
of
the
best
rustic
is
a
good
descriptor
its
very
outdoorsy
with
the
spiciness
floral
and
orchard
qualities
and
soft
woodiness
hill
farmstead
nailed
this
guy
thanks
again
ryan
o
impressed
no
bells
and
whistles
nothing
crazy
here
just
a
really
really
well
done
saison
as
with
all
hill
farmstead
this
beer
gives
the
feel
of
craftsmanship
and
has
an
intense
diversity

a
decent
sized

that
dissipates
slowly
aromas
of

with
hints
of
funkiness
and
bits
of
earthy
earthiness
to
round
it
all
out
really
nice
funkified
farmhouse
ale
o
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoy
the
crispness
that
holds
true
throughout
the
glass
very
flavorful
and
pleasantly
tart
a
delicious
farmhouse
style
ale
very
crisp
and
tart
with
complex
fruity
citrus
zest
and
spice
flavors
and
a
fantastic
clean
bready
malt
backbone
highly
aromatic
and
really
develops
as
you
allow
it
to
warm
in
the
glass
hill
farmstead
makes
some
amazing
beer
honestly
i
cant
wait
for
them
to
start
barrelaging
all
arthurs
but
for
now
i
will
savor
this
wonderfully
complex
yet
simple
saison
this
shit
right
here
creates
the
hype
of
hf
beers
overall
this
is
interesting
i
think
that
the
best
comparison
is
to
blvd
brewing
saison
brett
even
though
this
doesnt
have
brett
in
it
its
a
good
saison
not
perfect
i
prefer
more
of
the
traditional
belgian
flavors
like
bubblegum
clove
and
banana
in
my
saisons
but
its
pretty
damn
good
that
being
said
i
dont
think
that
i
would
be
paying
30
a
bottle
that
it
cost
out
in
cali
again
ill
wait
until
i
make
it
to
the
brewery
this
summer
not
the
most
remarkable
saison
but
a
very
enjoyable
effort
that
id
appreciate
drinking
again
sometime
awesome
saison
might
be
the
best
ive
ever
had
overall
hill
farmstead
saisons
are
fricking
amazing
this
one
is
no
exception
the
tartness
really
adds
depth
to
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
by
the
gallons
and
never
get
bored
this
beer
is
very
much
reminiscent
of
dupont
saison
beautiful
carb
lightly
drying
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
all
day
underrated
and
stands
up
as
one
of
the
better
hf
saison
offerings
oa
refined
saison
delicate
tried
and
true
hill
farmstead
really
awesome
m
dry
and
thin
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
o
a
great
beer
extremly
refreshing
the
bottle
will
be
empty
before
you
know
it
serving
type
bottle
oa
excellent
saison
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
with
a
good
carb
and
the
taste
with
that
sourtart
finish
is
awesome
this
is
a
very
unique
yeast
that
did
a
beautiful
job
turning
this
wart
into
a
all
around
enjoyable
thirst
quenching
brew
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
go
to
hill
farmstead
and
even
more
fortunate
to
be
there
when
this
is
on
tapbottled
get
your
self
some
you
will
not
be
disappointed
pale

colour
hazy
with
a
ring
of
white

lots
of
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
yeast
and
frutis
bright
citrus
pepper
and
spice
creeps
in
with
a
little
bit
of
funk
a
bit
of
malt
followed
by
more
fruits
taste
is
sharp
and
tart
followed
by
some
lemon
flavours
similar
to
sweet
tart
tons
of
citrus
fruit
long
drying
finish
medium
drying
carbonation
medium
body
so
good
and
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
i
probably
could
have
drank
the
bottle
alone
no
problem
would
love
to
have
this
again
od
this
was
pretty
tasty
lots
of
funky
and
lemony
elements
fairly
drinkable
well
put
together
flavours
had
out
of
a
bottle
friend
visited
hill
farmstead
and
came
back
with
one
this
poured
a
very
heady
pour
and
very
light
color
is
this
a
bud
light
the
smell
hits
you
quickly
i
read
the
word
tart
from
others
and
this
is
100
true
very
pure
saison
that
has
traces
of
a
sour
ale
almost
in
my
mind
but
better
carbonated
i
hate
to
grade
this
as
the
style
isnt
in
my
wheelhouse
but
i
can
see
others
liking
it
i
am
still
drinking
it
trying
to
determine
if
it
is
growing
on
me
i
think
it
is
damn
it
is
tart
the
pour
is
a
hazy
orange
golden
yellow
with
a
smallish
white
head
nice
lace
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
soft
lemon
citrus
dry
floral
a
bit
of
yeast
funk
and
a
very
pleasant
mineral
earth
encompassing
the
entire
nose
the
taste
is
tart
lemon
citrus
with
floral
character
opening
up
to
the
dry
funk
yeast
earth
and
mineral
the
palate
is
lovely
medium
to
light
bodied
soft
natural
carbonation
and
a
dry
tart
funk
mineral
finish
o
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
so
i
may
be
off
the
overwhelming
tart
lemon
was
unpleasant
to
me
i
opened
a
second
bottle
to
confirm
that
the
first
bottle
was
not
a
bad
sample
but
the
same
flavors
and
smell
was
presented
loved
several
other
hf
offerings
but
this
one
i
did
not
like
overall
for
a
rustic
saison
this
is
a
great
beer
its
not
really
at
all
sweet
there
are
other
options
for
that
kind
of
saison
the
brett
is
the
dominating
flavor
but
its
quite
well
balanced
and
expertly
crafted
m
light
body
slightly
creamy
dry
moderate
carbonation
would
get
again
for
sure
i
liked
this
much
better
than
anna
overall
the
saison
isnt
the
most
complex
but
wine
flavors
really
round
it
out
very
nicely
pale
strawgolden
beer
thick
frothy
white
head
crisp
light
and
refreshing
citrus
notes
white
pepper
a
touch
earthy
and
light
spice
another
infinitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
saison
from
hf
i
prefered
clara
to
this
during
this
session
but
either
one
would
do
the
trick
on
a
summer
afternoon
terrific
saison
aroma
is
tantalizing
with
a
fruit
invitation
cloudy
yellow
understated
carbonation
allowing
for
the
palate
to
appreciate
the
tanginess
some
lace
slightly
pickled
lemon
taste
and
thats
a
good
thing
very
good
drinkability
lots
of
farmhouse
in
the
end
of
the
bottle
4
25
d
excellent
farmhouse
saison
the
trip
to
the
brewery
is
well
worth
it
for
their
offerings
and
worth
it
alone
to
pick
up
more
of
this
o
this
is
really
nice
but
i
really
wish
it
didnt
have
that
stomach
acid
effect
because
its
a
huge
turnoff
for
me
if
not
for
that
one
flaw
this
might
be
my
perfect
beer
in
the
lower
end
of
the
upper
tier
of
saisons
musty
and
earthy
not
stunning
but
very
good
overall
definitely
a
quality
refreshing
saison
just
a
tad
of
barnyard
which
mixes
nicely
with
the
flavors
the
hop
presence
adds
an
interesting
element
to
the
flavor
especially
the
finish
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
is
a
savior
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
hf
saisons
ive
had
so
far
but
id
like
to
revisit
anna
about
as
simple
and
straightforward
as
a
saison
can
be
yet
so
damn
tasty
overall
a
really
clean
well
crafted
saison
o
very
good
saison
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
citrus
slight
sourness
and
bitterness
o
another
nice
saison
from
hf
hits
all
the
balances
of
yeast
fruit
and
malt
othis
is
insanely
drinkable
the
flavors
come
together
so
well
giving
you
a
little
funk
with
your
malt
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
and
i
cannot
wait
to
get
more
im
adamant
about
saison
dupont
being
the
standard
bearer
for
the
style
but
arthur
blows
that
out
of
the
water
with
all
due
respect
dupont
did
have
the
saison
standard
bearer
title
for
a
very
long
time
for
me
another
great
beer
from
shaun
hill
o
god
the
last
time
i
had
this
same
batch
it
didnt
blow
me
away
this
time
around
it
is
clear
that
the
bugs
have
taken
over
and
just
bumped
this
beer
up
in
to
the
top
tier
the
lemon
adds
a
tartness
that
is
very
well
balanced
by
the
pepper
phenols
and
bitter
hop
notes
at
the
end
of
the
taste
the
high
carbonation
and
drying
effects
make
you
crave
another
sip
and
the
appearance
is
as
close
to
perfect
for
a
saison
as
one
could
ask
give
me
more
please
o
not
the
most
complex
saison
out
there
but
its
extremely
drinkable
refreshing
and
quaffable
even
one
of
those
simple
pleasures
sort
of
beers
overall
nothing
fancy
here
just
an
incredibly
well
crafted
refreshing
easy
to
drink
saison
o
a
world
class
saison
in
every
sense
a
bright
yet
dynamic
and
complex
beer
that
has
everything
i
love
about
saisons
an
instant
favorite
a
very
nice
beer
super
solid
o
another
very
tasty
saison
from
hf
compared
to
vera
mae
this
was
my
2nd
favorite
but
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
any
day
o
a
damn
solid
saison
but
i
much
prefer
anna
or
florence
over
this
it
is
rustic
and
a
bit
spicy
and
bready
i
just
prefer
fruitier
and
sweeter
saisons
overall
hands
down
the
best
saison
ive
had
period
o
a
crazy
delicious
example
of
what
i
hope
every
saisonfarmhouse
ale
tastes
like
when
i
put
my
lips
to
it
perfectly
executed
as
with
all
their
beers
the
hype
is
real
o
its
not
barrelaged
its
not
a
brettbomb
this
is
just
a
straightforward
saison
with
great
flavors
that
change
subtlety
through
each
sip
this
one
does
not
disappoint
verdict
a
pleasant
saison
from
hill
farmstead
but
the
earthier
rustic
elements
of
this
beer
arent
really
my
favorite
compared
to
anna
which
was
much
more
vibrant
this
seems
rather
pedestrian
id
still
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
saison
or
farmhouse
style
beer
big
thanks
goes
out
to
67couple
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
random
sunday
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
earth
fruit
hop
and
spice
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
fruit
hop
spice
earth
and
fruity
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
fruitiness
going
on
in
this
one
that
definitely
balanced
quite
well
with
the
saison
aspect
going
on
in
it
the
spicy
and
earthiness
from
the
style
definitely
shined
through
and
was
quite
well
incorporated
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
and
managed
to
compliment
the
other
aspects
well
i
just
wish
there
would
have
been
a
little
more
complexity
going
on
to
take
it
to
a
new
level
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
but
not
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
had
to
this
day
o
fantastic
beer
loved
the
level
of
tartness
mixed
with
the
lemonzest
flavors
going
on
in
this
beer
o
what
a
saison
barnhouse
funk
arthur
delivers
as
a
delicious
mouth
watering
saison
i
will
say
this
again
hill
farmstead
is
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
very
easy
drinking
beer
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
to
keep
me
wanting
more
but
not
to
overwhelm
the
palate
i
hate
most
saisons
but
whatever
hf
does
with
them
is
gold
because
this
is
another
winner
o
extremely
refreshing
and
quite
complex
i
love
this
saison
and
imagine
drinking
it
in
the
belgian
countryside
8
110
o
a
fantastic
beer
i
might
have
liked
this
better
than
abner
and
this
is
coming
from
a
big
time
hop
head
the
complexity
in
this
beer
is
top
notch
oanother
wonderful
beer
from
hf
shaun
can
do
no
wrong
o
im
completely
hooked
on
hf
saisons
and
this
is
not
stopping
me
perfectly
balanced
and
all
around
amazing
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
them
all
growler
at
buddha
beer
bar
in
nyc
thats
all
i
got
to
say
im
nearing
the
end
of
this
crate
of
hill
farmstead
i
traded
for
and
im
yet
to
come
up
with
a
single
worthwhile
thing
to
say
about
any
of
them
fuck
you
its
an
impressive
saison
thats
deep
in
flavor
and
a
fun
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
some
amazing
stuff
and
exactly
what
i
enjoy
in
a
saison
the
sour
citrus
is
there
with
a
perfect
balance
of
delicate
spice
and
yeast
flavours
really
great
stuff
oa
solid
saison
with
nice
flavors
easy
drinking
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
had
after
vera
mae
and
this
is
good
but
not
like
hfs
other
offerings
smells
slightly
farmhousey
tastes
like
a
somewhat
watered
down
version
of
the
style
not
a
ton
of
flavor
good
but
more
like
a
lager
or
witbier
than
a
saison
i
prefer
hfs
other
offerings
more
o
thanks
to
notjustgc
for
sending
this
in
a
trade
this
was
my
first
hill
farmstead
beer
and
was
it
ever
enjoyable
i
will
certainly
seek
this
and
other
hf
stuff
out
again
might
just
have
to
make
the
trek
to
vermont
as
it
might
be
easier
to
attain
that
way
o
thought
it
got
better
and
better
throughout
the
bottle
above
average
saison
without
a
doubt
o
outstanding
this
is
my
first
offering
from
them
and
i
have
to
say
that
their
beers
are
worth
seeking
out
wonderful
pretty
par
for
the
coarse
for
hill
farmstead
that
is
to
say
amazing
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
theres
great
balance
and
complexity
in
this
beer
and
itll
only
get
better
with
time
clearly
worth
a
try
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
light
and
easy
drinking
with
a
sort
of
hybrid
saisonipa
feel
about
it
the
nose
far
and
away
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
brew
with
the
flavor
profile
falling
a
bit
short
overall
though
it
is
without
fault
and
is
a
beer
i
would
revisit
if
given
the
opportunity
prior
to
drinking
this
i
commented
on
vera
mae
being
one
of
the
better
saisons
by
hill
farmstead
that
i
have
had
i
stand
corrected
arthur
is
even
better
nicely
done
o
a
very
flavorful
wellbalanced
brew
o
i
love
this
beer
tart
and
refreshing
incredibly
drinkable
and
delicious
if
you
have
an
opportunity
to
try
this
even
if
your
not
a
fan
of
the
style
deffiantly
take
advantage
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
high
dense
head
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
tangy
with
some
woody
notes
and
some
clean
mineral
sparkle
to
it
the
taste
is
tart
of
front
with
a
round
maltiness
in
the
middle
as
well
as
some
floral
and
herbal
notes
the
finish
is
clean
and
sharp
its
highly
carbonated
though
none
too
fizzy
a
tad
slick
a
nice
saison
if
on
the
tart
side
o
best
saison
ive
ever
had
period
old
review
aside
this
has
easily
morphed
into
one
of
my
favorite
beers
over
the
years
a
well
made
rustic
farmhouse
ale
bright
sharp
a
bit
tart
drinks
more
like
a
cider
i
would
like
a
bit
more
depth
as
its
a
bit
linear
but
its
still
a
nice
farmhouse
ale
worth
getting
if
youre
into
the
style
overall
i
cant
think
of
many
saisons
i
would
choose
to
drink
over
this
one
for
me
its
a
fantastic
combination
of
complexity
and
drinkability
it
holds
my
interest
in
the
same
way
a
good
sour
does
rr
temptation
but
is
so
refreshing
and
the
abv
is
so
reasonable
it
could
be
an
everyday
drinker
that
is
if
you
live
within
driving
distance
of
hf
and
have
a
bunch
of
to
spend
10750ml
its
worth
it
imo
but
i
do
not
drink
it
everyday
well
save
that
for
when
i
take
kramerica
public
o
this
was
a
fantastic
saison
that
had
a
nice
rustic
funkiness
and
tartness
to
it
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
a
saison
lover
who
likes
a
little
bit
of
tartnessfunk
to
their
saisons
i
can
definitely
see
how
some
people
would
not
care
for
this
beer
at
all
i
gave
some
to
my
dad
who
has
never
had
a
saison
or
sour
before
and
he
thought
it
was
the
worst
beer
that
he
had
ever
tasted
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
saison
another
hf
winner
i
wasnt
expecting
any
sourness
or
funk
but
the
taste
had
it
and
it
was
great
reminded
a
bit
of
fantome
would
love
to
get
this
one
again
sometime
this
to
me
is
the
definition
of
an
awesome
saison
this
reminds
me
of
how
i
felt
when
drinking
mckenzies
saison
vatour
du
bois
really
i
know
thee
arent
too
many
of
thee
floating
around
but
if
you
like
funky
saisons
get
this
great
carbonation
nice
body
glad
i
tried
this
joey
says
id
like
the
blue
bottle
more
than
this
turquoise
one
overall
another
amazing
offering
from
hill
farmstead
not
quite
as
good
as
vera
in
my
opinion
but
pretty
darn
close
pour
is
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
tight
slightly
off
white
head
the
nose
is
dupont
esq
which
puts
it
in
high
regard
extreme
farmhouse
yeast
a
bit
dusty
and
peppery
with
a
soft
lemon
in
back
wow
the
flavor
is
huge
very
unique
the
flavor
has
a
very
strong
peppery
presence
with
an
extremely
pronounced
fruity
lemon
less
the
tartness
the
farmhouse
yeast
is
a
bit
less
assertive
and
very
unique
a
touch
but
dusty
with
light
touches
of
mushroom
and
hay
the
body
is
soft
and
light
with
a
very
dry
finish
and
strong
carbonation
almost
champagne
like
pours
a
hazed
golden
color
with
a
tall
white
head
excellent
nose
to
this
straw
yeast
and
citrus
peel
aromas
a
light
sweetness
some
floral
notes
and
mild
spice
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
biscuit
malts
floral
hops
yeast
and
lightly
spicy
a
bit
of
citrus
peel
and
a
light
tartness
throughout
a
very
mild
funk
in
the
background
too
o
b
o
a
solid
saison
and
i
am
very
happy
the
i
have
another
bottle
i
would
really
like
to
try
art
based
on
how
good
this
beer
is
straw
yellow
with
a
lingering
head
big
aroma
of
tart
fruit
and
funkiness
moderate
carbonation
flavors
of
horse
blanket
fruit
rind
herbs
funky
yeast
grass
lemon
earthy
flavors
drinkable
in
modest
amounts
not
something
id
dream
about
but
flavorful
and
tasty
o
quite
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
few
complaints
about
backyard
saisondrinking
when
the
weather
is
as
gorgeous
as
this
my
wife
only
finished
about
half
her
glass
complaining
of
too
much
carbonation
i
didnt
mind
at
all
and
thought
the
carbonation
was
just
right
springy
and
lively
enough
but
not
overdone
this
ranks
up
there
among
the
really
good
us
saisons
ive
tried
not
terribly
complex
but
altogether
satisfying
to
drink
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
yeast
spice
pepper
and
some
citrusy
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
nice
spice
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
o
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
session
beer
for
me
wold
love
to
track
down
some
more
of
this
one
as
i
found
it
very
tasty
just
enough
but
not
too
much
barnyard
funk
a
really
well
made
very
clean
super
easy
drinking
beer
light
body
good
carbonation
refreshing
and
crisp
however
it
lacks
both
the
sharpness
of
dupont
and
certainly
the
complexity
of
fantome
having
tried
their
ipas
and
a
couple
other
styles
i
am
totally
bowled
over
by
the
hoppy
stuff
but
i
am
not
overly
impressed
with
the
porter
or
the
saison
or
the
wild
ale
mimosa
o
easy
drinking
flavorful
saison
well
done
great
for
an
american
version
of
the
style
very
refreshing
and
clean
its
a
bit
different
not
the
most
impressive
saison
as
it
plays
it
safe
not
going
too
tart
or
sweet
or
yeasty
but
its
pretty
tasty
and
veryyy
easy
drinking
the
body
is
light
with
expansive
carbonation
overall
a
sound
saison
real
tasty
stuff
which
is
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
hill
farmstead
out
of
a
bottle
given
to
me
for
my
birthday
thanks
david
this
beer
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
was
impressive
and
it
left
consistent
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
melon
apricot
grassy
hops
pepper
hints
of
citrus
and
some
musty
horseblanket
the
flavors
were
also
complex
and
impressive
though
not
as
well
defined
as
the
aroma
it
did
have
all
the
aforementioned
elements
built
around
a
core
of
pilsner
malt
and
toasted
malt
clean
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
delicate
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
perfect
a
very
nice
american
saison
and
it
made
me
proud
to
be
a
vermonter
this
is
a
rustic
farmhouse
saison
yep
i
agree
with
that
assessment
nice
beer
o
a
solid
saison
allaround
but
nothing
earth
shattering
above
average
but
not
my
favorite
from
hf
overall
very
light
faint
and
super
flavorful
a
delicate
beer
that
is
a
masterpiece
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
a
hill
beer
and
this
is
right
with
the
best
of
them
i
could
drink
this
every
day
a
friend
of
mine
who
i
gave
some
to
said
this
tasted
like
a
fine
champaign
and
i
tend
to
agree
o
light
and
smooth
very
refreshing
this
is
a
solid
saison
but
lacking
in
the
wow
factor
some
of
the
other
hf
saisons
bring
to
the
table
d
drinkability
the
modest
abv
keeps
the
drinkability
high
i
would
definitely
order
this
beer
again
several
times
over
o
goes
down
easy
very
tasty
somewhat
filling
mild
kick
very
nice
representation
of
stle
od
pleased
with
my
first
hill
farmstead
offering
very
delicate
and
refreshing
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
that
remains
balanced
thanks
to
duff27
for
sharing
per
usual
do
highly
drinkable
even
if
over
a
long
session
heres
to
my
girls
50th
review
thanks
for
the
hill
farmstead
bhollas
clean
lemon
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
in
this
and
thats
about
it
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
but
i
was
expecting
more
d
crushable
stuff
i
drank
most
of
the
750ml
bottle
on
my
own
after
pouring
a
few
small
snifters
for
guests
my
own
complaint
is
that
the
taste
is
a
bit
tame
and
doesnt
match
the
other
facets
of
the
beer
i
like
art
better
but
id
gladly
have
this
again
bottle
poured
a
hazy
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
nice
large
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
excellent
lacing
aroma
of
rustic
ester
and
floral
malt
is
very
nice
and
enticing
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
floral
malt
with
good
attenuation
and
limited
sweetness
with
some
rustic
notes
and
a
lightly
spicy
yeast
strain
body
is
full
with
excellent
carbonation
hops
are
present
though
not
overly
so
and
provide
nice
zesty
flavour
another
great
combination
between
some
complex
flavour
while
retaining
some
great
complexity
o
overall
this
is
another
good
solid
enjoyable
beer
from
hill
farmstead
wish
i
didnt
have
to
drive
almost
4
hours
to
get
their
brews
overall
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
great
balance
lots
of
flavor
but
still
light
and
easy
to
drink
id
love
to
have
it
again
a
very
tasty
and
spicy
beer
a
great
example
of
the
saison
style
od
second
beer
i
have
tried
from
hill
farmstead
and
the
second
one
that
i
would
drink
again
i
am
not
a
seasoned
saison
connoisseur
but
this
is
nice
and
light
yet
spicy
and
full
of
flavor
i
wish
it
were
easier
to
get
overall
nice
great
flavors
right
on
for
saison
nice
hops
that
come
late
dry
finish
good
carb
nice
farmhouse
flavors
very
light
spices
and
a
nice
lemony
citrus
flavor
the
palate
opens
crisp
with
a
firm
hop
bite
with
earth
lemon
orange
peel
and
a
mild
resin
character
bitterness
is
moderate
and
allows
the
malt
and
yeast
flavors
to
come
through
moderate
grass
and
pilsner
malt
along
with
a
grainy
flavor
the
malt
character
is
mellow
and
refined
the
yeast
mostly
adds
flavors
of
clove
and
phenols
especially
on
the
finish
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
crisp
clean
hoppy
bitterness
and
the
aforementioned
flavors
this
tastes
very
good
im
not
picking
up
much
of
the
fruit
or
honey
character
that
i
got
on
the
nose
though
the
mouthfeel
is
surprising
both
the
body
light
and
carbonation
mediumhigh
are
spot
on
but
theres
a
mild
wateriness
on
the
midpalate
thats
a
little
disappointing
apart
from
that
this
is
an
excellent
saison
one
im
glad
to
have
gotten
the
chance
to
enjoy
quite
a
nice
beer
to
be
honest
i
expected
more
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
fits
all
the
criteria
to
be
a
very
solid
saison
im
a
big
fan
of
hill
farmstead
saisons
this
is
really
great
as
a
basic
no
frills
version
4
0
d
solid
no
frills
saison
plenty
of
earth
and
herb
with
good
complexity
in
the
taste
very
refreshing
and
nicely
balanced
o
good
for
the
style
overall
a
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
saison
a
really
sloid
example
of
the
style
and
another
really
good
brew
from
hill
farmstead
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
yet
another
excellent
saison
from
shaun
and
dan
not
my
favorite
im
more
of
an
anna
lover
but
still
very
enjoyable
ill
revisit
in
a
couple
of
months
and
see
how
it
tastes
already
looking
forward
to
it
recommend
the
beer
is
hazy
and
yellow
hued
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
ample
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
floral
citrus
malt
yeast
the
flavor
is
decent
overly
yeasty
with
some
fruit
notes
perhaps
apricots
the
feel
is
very
dry
with
lingering
yeast
overall
a
decent
saison
that
could
stand
a
few
improvements
a
very
light
and
crisp
saison
no
skunky
hops
here
see
ya
dupont
all
about
refreshing
after
a
long
hot
days
work
cheers
shaun
and
crew
d
arthur
is
a
fantastic
saison
with
plenty
of
herbal
hop
bite
a
pleasant
lemony
character
and
nice
dose
of
tartness
keep
racking
up
the
great
beers
shaun
then
chowdahead
tells
me
this
has
been
in
the
growler
for
a
week
and
a
half
say
what
cupcake
tasted
like
it
was
filled
that
day
i
am
once
again
very
impressed
by
hill
farmstead
seeking
more
cheers
had
it
again
in
bottle
about
6
months
later
as
it
ages
the
lemon
grassy
qualities
becomes
a
bit
more
pronounced
not
my
favorite
saison
by
them
but
as
particular
as
that
sounds
still
as
american
saison
stable
that
only
one
i
could
say
is
ranging
in
similarities
with
the
saison
dupont
a
good
saison
but
not
great
drinks
much
larger
than
the
5
abv
and
could
use
a
little
more
crispness
andor
earthy
funk
hv
d
good
not
great
i
liked
it
but
i
prefer
my
saisons
to
be
a
little
cleaner
and
funkier
i
just
dont
seem
to
like
these
bready
saisons
very
much
i
guess
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
preferred
the
citra
to
this
but
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
saison
and
im
continually
impressed
by
hill
farmstead
arthur
came
out
looking
like
a
saison
golden
straw
colored
in
appearance
with
a
bright
white
head
up
above
leaving
nice
patterns
smell
is
a
semibig
belgian
yeast
profile
with
earthy
grass
ridden
hops
some
citrus
and
spice
they
work
together
well
nothing
too
overpowering
the
other
my
first
saison
from
the
farm
is
a
good
one
arthur
starts
with
the
earth
the
grass
the
yeast
bread
semi
tropical
fruits
very
muted
but
noted
with
pear
slices
its
a
simple
saison
with
a
american
twist
thats
not
to
outragous
or
out
there
good
for
a
whirl
feel
is
kinda
lower
than
medium
with
a
small
carb
bite
as
well
a
yeasty
aftertaste
with
some
bitter
hops
at
the
end
i
could
probably
drink
more
of
this
stuff
another
good
one
from
the
boys
at
the
farm
chewy
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
bready
yeast
which
contributes
to
the
moutfeel
there
is
also
a
lot
of
zesty
peppery
spice
up
front
with
more
coriander
and
lemon
zest
hints
of
sweet
citrus
and
crisp
light
fuir
especially
orange
peel
apple
and
pear
not
a
bery
high
abv
but
the
alcohol
presence
is
still
felt
a
bit
overly
spicy
and
hit
but
the
nice
mouthfeel
helps
the
drinkability
theres
plenty
of
complexity
here
but
the
flavors
dont
seem
entirely
harmonious
to
me
im
also
not
crazy
about
the
yeast
which
brings
too
much
cloying
bubblegum
flavor
d
good
saison
for
sure
simple
and
clean
im
liking
this
brewery
tart
citrusy
aroma
with
trademark
saison
yeast
and
spice
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
laces
well
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
light
refreshing
flavor
with
citrus
and
hops
in
excellent
balance
nice
dry
finish
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
really
good
saison
best
of
this
style
ive
had
from
hill
farmstead
so
far
goes
down
very
easy
cheers
drinkability
so
sessionable
but
this
sample
is
past
peak
more
high
quality
and
well
worth
seeking
out
brew
from
hill
farmstead
d
this
beer
was
above
average
it
is
immensely
drinkable
at
5
interesting
take
on
a
saison
delicious
goes
well
with
a
grainfed
beef
burger
from
the
farmhose
tap
and
grill
the
taste
is
nice
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
yeast
character
really
nice
feel
with
a
light
body
and
excellent
carbonation
really
nice
and
sessionable
i
had
heard
about
all
of
hfs
excellent
hoppy
beers
and
read
about
fear
trembling
but
i
had
no
idea
on
this
and
it
was
a
really
pleasant
surprise
taste
is
very
fresh
and
fruity
also
get
that
apricot
taste
here
seeing
a
theme
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
creamy
and
rich
light
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
ever
had
no
idea
how
shaun
does
it
but
keep
it
up
cloudy
straw
color
smells
exactly
how
it
tastes
moderately
tart
lemony
and
peppery
every
once
in
a
while
ill
get
some
sweetness
that
i
assume
is
the
honey
fighting
through
the
flavors
being
moderate
seem
deliberate
though
and
makes
for
superb
drinking
typical
chewy
hf
mouthfeel
rounds
it
out
and
makes
for
a
very
nice
experience
and
probably
my
favorite
non
fruited
hf
saison
my
second
hf
saison
and
i
continue
to
be
unimpressed
yes
its
clean
and
nice
and
inoffensive
but
man
does
this
bite
the
hell
out
if
me
tastes
like
brett
super
dry
very
little
flavor
otherwise
from
the
malts
very
light
bodied
almost
to
the
point
if
watery
its
just
fine
and
inoffensive
but
ive
yet
to
find
much
more
overrated
than
this
hand
me
a
tank
7
off
the
shelf
please
b
poured
into
a
tasting
glass
anna
is
glassine
golden
straw
with
a
robust
rockandcream
head
and
a
central
column
of
effervescence
the
bouquet
erupts
from
the
glass
dominated
by
green
apple
wet
grass
and
honey
the
taste
opens
with
a
mix
of
tartness
and
earth
but
this
gives
way
to
a
biscuit
and
spice
finish
if
theres
one
adjective
for
anna
its
dewy
this
is
a
sweet
pastoral
ale
mixing
citrus
bread
honey
apple
and
hints
of
ginger
brown
sugar
and
pepper
anna
is
full
and
zesty
but
also
refreshing
this
is
a
product
that
showcases
the
liquid
component
as
strongly
as
its
malt
hops
and
adjuncts
its
just
so
damn
drinkable
you
have
to
stop
yourself
from
swilling
it
down
bottled
on
092014
drank
side
by
side
with
east
bank
i
liked
the
east
bank
more
but
would
love
to
drink
this
again
worth
seeking
out
overall
complex
with
lots
of
taste
and
a
great
mix
of
flavours
you
can
tell
this
is
made
of
some
high
quality
ingredients
and
it
is
well
crafted
it
would
be
nice
to
drink
beers
like
this
every
day
world
class
stuff
its
the
same
base
as
other
hill
farmstead
saisons
and
the
honey
adds
enough
dimension
to
keep
it
interesting
well
worth
the
try
and
just
a
touch
above
the
rest
much
love
and
thanks
to
roguer
for
this
one
as
well
this
whole
box
has
been
one
revelation
after
another
over
carbonated
tart
funky
not
my
favorite
thing
from
them
ever
yet
another
good
hill
farmstead
beer
its
not
quite
on
the
level
of
their
best
beers
but
its
still
better
than
98
of
farmhouse
ales
out
there
light
crisp
apple
skin
bit
funky
delicious
o
this
is
delicious
and
just
right
for
me
the
flavors
play
off
one
another
and
are
surprisingly
balanced
in
a
nutshell
i
am
not
a
fan
of
beers
brewed
with
honey
most
have
a
slipperyslimey
mouthfeel
and
are
over
the
top
sweet
but
being
a
hill
farmstead
product
i
was
excitedbut
not
optimistic
to
give
anna
a
try
this
beer
breaks
the
mold
for
honey
brewed
beers
the
mouth
feel
was
soft
not
slimey
the
flavor
was
incredible
you
could
taste
the
wildflower
honey
but
the
uniquely
sour
flavor
brought
balance
and
complexity
the
weak
link
in
this
brew
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
the
slight
sour
milk
aroma
but
that
is
nitpicking
this
beer
was
probably
the
best
beer
i
consumed
in
2014
and
probably
top
10
all
time
bravo
hill
farmstead
described
as
a
honey
saison
but
it
is
much
more
complex
than
that
first
bottle
was
good
to
very
good
a
few
weeks
later
and
my
second
bottle
was
so
much
better
to
me
very
smooth
definitely
honeylike
and
not
unlike
biere
de
miel
before
opening
my
second
bottle
i
described
anna
as
geuzelike
but
750
ml
was
too
much
geuze
i
take
that
back
this
is
simply
a
delight
this
is
a
very
refined
beer
with
hints
of
wildflower
honey
and
mild
but
addictive
sour
taste
definitely
a
world
class
beer
pots
fruitful
pours
beautiful
with
a
nice
light
color
white
head
and
6
5
undetectable
abv
damn
good
beer
although
the
hype
may
have
caused
me
to
be
slightly
underwhelmed
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
brings
a
unique
flavor
profile
not
sure
it
should
be
wildly
soughtafter
but
its
better
than
most
any
offtheshelf
farmhouse
ales
with
wider
distribution
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
soapy
and
slick
character
i
seem
to
get
throughout
along
with
to
much
honey
sweetness
in
the
finish
not
that
it
is
bad
at
all
just
not
particularly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
the
style
this
is
a
flat
out
wonderful
saison
shaun
mastery
of
the
style
continues
overall
a
very
good
saison
but
doesnt
quite
blow
me
away
quite
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
hf
saisons
i
liked
this
beer
although
the
style
isnt
one
i
usually
search
for
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
experience
the
their
take
on
the
style
anna
is
perfect
example
of
a
farmhouse
brew
the
aroma
is
filled
with
barnyard
straw
hints
of
honey
and
pepper
the
taste
is
spoton
soft
lemon
and
honey
flavors
are
balances
with
hints
of
clove
allspice
white
pepper
and
orange
marmalade
love
this
brew
fresh
and
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
cheers
all
o
this
ale
is
clearly
the
culmination
of
travel
and
insight
of
friendships
and
explorations
and
of
realizing
a
sense
of
ones
place
would
drink
again
among
saisons
this
is
good
but
not
to
the
level
of
most
fantome
stuff
overall
really
balanced
drinkable
saison
nice
mild
funk
some
citrus
honey
and
a
bit
of
juiciness
delicious
4

this
is
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
and
ill
leave
it
at
that
for
now
wow
awesome
aroma
and
flavor
with
tartness
lemon
and
funky
notes
good
depth
and
complexity
elegant
and
refreshing
too
well
worth
its
high
rating
my
first
hill
farmstead
saison
and
i
can
see
what
the
hype
is
about
this
is
absolutely
delicious
balanced
and
complex
not
too
tart
with
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
very
good
representation
of
the
style
fruity
on
the
nose
with
a
sweet
banana
and
ripened
pear
aroma
notes
of
clove
and
spice
with
a
bit
of
peppercorn
the
scent
takes
a
doughy
malty
turn
the
flavor
as
a
nice
direction
of
honey
lemons
and
tea
with
some
peppery
taste
its
very
light
sprite
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
with
a
finish
of
apple
and
pear
this
really
is
what
a
saison
should
be
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
another
amazing
beer
produced
by
shaun
hill
overall
another
great
saison
from
hill
farmstead
well
worth
seeking
out
o
just
a
beautiful
beer
perfectly
crafted
biere
de
miel
o
another
nice
saison
from
hf
but
i
do
not
get
much
honey
more
of
a
lemony
sweetness
to
it
quite
the
accomplishment
with
this
one
love
the
honey
sweetness
changing
it
up
the
tartness
balances
it
out
beautifully
complexity
is
not
over
the
top
but
the
sheer
mastery
that
shaun
reigns
in
this
style
category
shows
up
all
over
anna
a
beer
to
drink
now
and
one
i
suspect
well
age
graciously
over
the
course
of
a
few
years
stoked
to
sit
on
some
and
revisit
in
two
years
or
so
finely
honed
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
another
brilliant
hf
saison
pale
blonde
colour
big
white
head
with
some
lace
left
behind
smell
is
quite
fruity
apple
and
lemon
some
orange
a
bit
of
wheat
and
honey
lighjtly
funky
as
well
taste
is
fruity
and
tart
lemon
and
citrus
fruit
dry
with
grassy
flavours
and
a
bit
of
dill
also
the
slightest
suggestion
of
honey
funky
with
just
a
slight
sourness
to
it
dry
spritzy
carbonation
medium
bodied
solid
stuff
as
was
expected
however
i
think
i
enjoyed
arthur
more
but
would
certainly
entertain
this
again
wiothout
question
overall
i
had
big
hopes
from
the
smell
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
deliver
good
just
not
great
pour
is
hazed
golden
color
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
has
a
strong
floral
note
faint
honey
juicy
notes
and
light
sweetness
taste
is
very
nice
floral
up
front
like
clara
juicy
bright
fruits
as
the
well
carbonated
finish
brings
in
the
sweet
honey
balance
very
tight
and
balanced
nice
dusty
quality
mid
palate
from
the
saison
yeast
with
an
interesting
sweetness
of
honey
in
the
finish
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
from
hf
id
say
that
this
is
brother
soigné
without
the
extra
citrus
flavours
i
may
even
appreciate
the
more
subtle
flavours
here
its
just
so
damn
good
and
refreshing
somewhere
in
between
a
lambic
and
a
saison
as
all
hill
farmstead
sourssaisons
tend
to
be
a
good
saison
with
notes
of
lemon
earthy
grain
and
some
mild
yeast
spice
o
simply
phenomenal
saison
o
this
beer
is
the
real
deal
i
love
hf
saisons
and
this
may
be
my
favorite
with
nearly
a
year
of
age
on
this
bottle
theres
so
much
nice
funk
and
sourness
you
can
taste
the
brett
lambicus
hfs
house
ale
yeast
is
bacteria
heaven
i
cant
get
enough
this
bottle
of
anna
was
just
short
of
spectacular
for
me
although
i
tend
to
like
a
lot
of
hf
saison
better
would
get
again
o
an
excellent
saison
very
easy
drinking
and
very
flavorful
at
the
same
time
ohill
farmstead
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
their
farmhouse
saisons
are
phenomenal
having
had
this
shortly
after
drinking
la
vermontoise
i
was
hoping
this
would
pour
a
better
head
oa
really
enjoyable
saison
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
great
balance
of
tart
and
sweet
flavors
thanks
wildcats10
for
the
opportunity
o
the
essence
of
the
style
vermont
farmhouse
ale
no
other
american
brewer
that
i
know
of
can
either
match
or
exceed
the
qualities
and
characteristics
of
the
finest
belgian
saisonsfarmhouse
ales
overall
a
very
nice
and
flavourful
saison
with
that
signature
hill
farmstead
style
always
a
treat
to
drink
something
from
these
guys
o
a
nice
saison
has
a
solid
mix
of
flavors
highly
drinkable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
it
were
available
o
i
always
approach
trendy
hyped
beers
with
a
bit
of
caution
but
hill
farmstead
is
legit
theres
a
reason
they
have
just
exploded
their
beers
are
worldclass
and
completely
worth
seeking
out
anna
being
no
exception
this
bright
and
aromatic
saison
is
fermented
with
their
strain
of
exceptional
yeast
for
a
total
sensory
experience
thats
dangerously
drinkable
and
quick
to
disappear
cherish
each
rustic
sip
for
this
saison
is
hard
to
come
by
and
worth
its
weight
in
gold
verdict
a
truly
wonderful
honey
saison
from
hill
farmstead
wonderfully
complex
and
delightfully
balanced
this
really
is
one
of
the
more
remarkable
american
made
saisons
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
this
style
overall
this
is
a
nice
light
easy
to
drink

like
some
of

theyre
refined
and
improved

some
nice

kind
of
a
funky
beer
jazzy
and
different
from
the
legions
of
mediocre
saisons
out
there
the
fact
that
this
was
in
colorado
even
by
trade
had
me
very
excited
arguably
the
best
thing
new
england
does
at
all
is
hill
farmstead
in
my
humble
opinion
the
pour
is
a
really
hazy
muted
yellowy
color
creamy
white
head
several
inches
high
continues
to
rise
the
nose
is
obviously
sweet
a
honey
focused
brew
no
doubt
but
the
low
key
spice
and
cirtus
qualities
of
the
yeast
are
evident
as
an
equalizer
and
this
is
promising
to
be
delicious
its
an
assault
of
flavor
coating
the
entire
palate
polleny
springtime
honey
is
prominent
but
there
isnt
that
much
residual
sugar
the
yeast
is
also
just
behind
center
stage
more
peppery
funk
than
i
thought
from
the
nose
but
it
does
cut
right
through
some
of
that
sugar
there
is
lemon
juice
too
mostly
in
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
also
on
the
citrusy
side
before
everything
gives
way
to
a
sort
of
off
yeasty
aftertaste
which
is
the
weakness
of
this
beer
for
me
its
not
quite
metallic
but
it
is
minerally
and
bitter
and
not
quite
congruent
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
creamy
texture
though
and
a
nice
full
round
body
for
a
beer
this
light
in
color
i
really
appreciate
its
expansive
properties
and
the
carbonation
is
fine
although
it
may
contribute
a
granular
character
when
combined
with
the
unfiltered
yeast
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
saison
im
now
even
more
curious
to
try
their
others
o
lets
be
accurate
here
there
is
no
question
that
hf
knows
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
the
saison
style
anna
is
a
work
of
art
in
the
saison
department
the
honey
and
grassy
component
makes
for
a
champagne
like
experience
im
glad
we
have
more
of
these
othe
honey
and
wheat
go
together
perfectly
having
hopslam
before
this
this
is
how
honey
should
be
used
in
a
beer
fantastic
stuff
i
must
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
tasted
the
carb
was
very
creamy
aroma
and
taste
amazing
the
hint
of
honey
was
ever
so
light
on
the
finish
and
the
color
was
yellow
as
a
golden
straw
i
want
more
this
will
be
on
the
top
of
my
list
for
a
long
time
o
how
do
they
keep
doing
it
sweet
and
tart
smoot
and
very
nice
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
pretty
subtle
with
lemon
grass
and
a
strange
yeast
smell
takes
over
for
me
after
that
the
taste
is
is
more
complex
with
a
lemon
bite
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
a
honey
sweetness
and
a
lingering
citrus
tang
and
spicy
after
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
light
but
right
for
the
style
overall
im
very
impressed
with
another
beer
from
hill
farmstead
hopefully
they
have
this
the
next
time
i
make
the

pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
persists
forever
being
constantly
fed
by
a
steady
stream
of
carb
bubbles
and
leaving
much
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
citrus
spicy
and
a
bit
funky
light
pepper
with
lemon
and
grapefruit
aromas
mixed
with
a
spicy
wheat
bready
character
and
a
solid
shot
of
earthy
yeast
funk
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
with
light
sugar
and
honey
before
we
segue
into
some
really
nice
juicy
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
a
hint
of
pepper
and
spice
and
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
funk
and
a
light
tart
fruitiness
provide
a
really
nice
contrast
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
saison
i
normally
wont
go
for
the
style
but
if
this
were
more
available
i
could
see
this
being
my
go
to
warm
weather
beer
o
really
great
sweet
taste
with
phenomenal
mouthfeel
the
smell
isnt
heavy
or
strong
as
id
like
and
the
color
is
close
but
not
perfect
with
a
lot
of
head
still
a
really
great
offering
from
hill
farmstead
true
to
style
tastey
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
drink
again
anna
was
definitely
not
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
it
was
truly
flawless
in
every
regard
furthermore
it
was
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
come
across
in
a
very
long
time
hill
farmstead
does
it
again
its
hard
to
get
a
firm
handle
on
the
color
of
anna
due
to
the
dim
lighting
but
it
appears
to
be
a
mildly
opaque
golden
to
lemon
yellow
two
fingers
of
airy
white
foam
crown
the
beer
and
hang
around
for
a
minute
a
light
dusting
of
lacing
remains
attached
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
pleasant
with
aromas
of
lemon
zest
straw
and
a
touch
of
freshly
cracked
black
pepper
i
take
a
sip
and
here
the
malt
character
is
more
bready
than
straw
like
subtle
black
pepper
comes
in
next
and
quickly
transitions
to
a
finish
that
features
both
lemon
and
a
soft
fruitiness
the
body
is
well
dried
out
and
the
carbonation
supremely
lively
on
my
palate
just
a
superb
mouthfeel
all
around
i
havent
always
been
as
impressed
with
hill
farmsteads
saisons
and
sours
as
i
have
with
their
porters
and
hoppy
beers
but
anna
is
a
fantastic
brew
very
tart
for
a
saison
and
yet
still
get
a
whole
lot
of
layers
of
interesting
fruit
combinations
more
tart
and
less
funk
than
what
i
remember
from
the
bottle
a
fantastic
saison
o
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
think
it
shows
how
much
a
yeast
strain
makes
or
breaks
a
saison
i
am
not
typically
a
fan
of
this
style
however
with
this
one
even
though
the
yeast
is
a
major
component
of
the
flavor
profile
i
still
find
its
lightly
earthy
tart
funk
very
enjoyable
o
a
very
solid
and
well
made
saison
the
addition
of
honey
is
nice
and
provides
a
subtle
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
spice
and
floral
aspects
overall
my
least
favorite
hill
farmstead
saison
to
date
but
still
a
home
run
delicious
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
lively
level
of
carbonation
it
opens
up
awkward
and
slightly
offputting
but
grows
on
me
as
the
experience
continues
for
6
5
the
alcohol
is
present
and
warming
but
not
distracting
having
this
once
was
enough
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
i
dont
have
much
interest
in
trying
this
again
3

d
i
looked
at
some
reviews
after
making
mine
and
i
must
say
that
either
this
bottle
is
different
from
what
others
have
been
drinking
or
they
are
imagining
smells
and
flavors
that
said
its
a
good
beer
but
id
take
a
hf
ipa
or
porter
over
this

200th
review
cheers
mthe
mouthfeel
is
incredible
with
the
carbonation
being
high
with
a
medium
to
low
body
a
perfect
exacmple
of
this
style
will
be
sad
to
see
this
one
go
when
i
drink
it
all
o
this
was
the
first
bottle
we
tried
during
our
tasting
personally
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
then
e
and
art
i
loved
the
honey
flavoring
that
balanced
with
the
light
barnyard
funk
and
made
an
very
drinkable
saison
definitely
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
saison
very
much
so
that
i
almost
ordered
a
second
glass
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
14
other
hill
farmstead
offering
on
tap
very
glad
that
i
got
to
try
the
base
beer
for
ann
the
night
before
ann
was
released
overall
yeasty
as
hell
with
some
nice
flavors
but
nothing
outstanding
its
actually
a
little
dull
as
always
its
perfectly
crafted
overall
great
nice
saison
flavors
just
a
hint
of
floral
hops
that
add
and
dont
subtract
from
the
beer
like
a
lot
of
hops
would
honey
adds
an
interesting
component
that
is
light
but
dries
the
finish
nicely
decent
malts
and
great
yeast
flavors
that
bring
good
farmhouse
flavors
and
border
on
funk
but
dont
quite
get
there
wish
i
could
get
lots
of
this
for
the
summer
this
isnt
my
favorite
saison
from
hf
but
its
still
a
good
or
better
than
many
out
there
keep
up
the
awesome
work
saisons
are
on
the
very
low
end
of
my
style
preference
but
this
was
a
very
well
made
one
that
accentuates
the
good
and
downplays
the
elements
of
the
style
i
dont
like
another
winner
from
hf
initial
taste
was
extremely
bretty
and
sharply
bitter
mellows
out
into
a
much
nicer
beer
as
it
warms
with
the
yeast
taking
its
place
amongst
the
other
of
flavors
malt
somehow
stays
with
the
nose
and
doesnt
permeate
into
the
flavor
profile
the
final
balance
is
rounded
and
clean
yet
still
sports
tons
of
yeast
good
carbonation
level
a
pleasant
saison
though
its
a
healthy
step
or
two
below
the
best
hf
brews

spice
lemon

banana

taste
is
similar
although
somewhat
sweet
with
honey
decent
saison
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
medium
body
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
classic
saison
and
well
made
if
youre
fan
of
the
style
as
i
am
in
the
summer
dont
pass
thist
one
up
if
you
see
it
take
the
label
off
of
the
beer
and
any
aficionado
of
belgian
ales
will
undoubtedly
declare
this
as
one
of
the
countrys
finest
farmhouse
ales
drink
good
but
i
think
they
do
dipas
better
although
wanna
give
damon
a
go
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
bone
colored

that
settles
to
some
small
bubbles
on

of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
grain
spices
citrus
aromas
and
a
sourtart
presence
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
emphasis
on
the
spices
along
with
a
yeast
flavor
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
this
one
smells
better
than
it
tastes
o
very
solid
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
mustiness
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
o
wonderful
beer
i
found
myself
returning
to
this
bottle
for
more
samples
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
and
flavor
that
i
love
in
saisons
hopefully
ill
have
another
chance
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
brew
overall
another
excellent
saison
from
hill
farmstead
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
my
favorite
saison
they
brew
at
all
but
it
is
really
light
and
refreshing
great
for
a
summer
day
pours
an
effervescent
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
a

this
nose
is
outstanding
with
a
slightly
sour
funky
sweet
and
bitter
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
an
excellent
aftertaste
highly
recommended
and
worth
trying
anna
is
a
very
tasty
well
balanced

off

it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
has
great
appeal
all
around
this
was
a
great
beer
and
i
actually
prefer
it
to
the
other
saisons
ive
had
from
hill
farmstead
but
those
were
in
bottles
great
beer
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try

forward
beer
here
decent
but
not
my
favorite
saison
from
him
o
a
great
saison
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
really
wish
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
i
am
a
big
fan
of
saisons
and
this
is
just
jumped
up
the
list
to
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
though
needs
a
bit
more
depth
of
flavor
pretty
awesome
love
the
honey
used
in
this
pours
a
light
crisp
yellow
hidden
beneath
a
persistent
finger
of
white
billowy
foam
brilliant
clarity
the
ale
yeast
dominates
the
nose
with
hints
of
apples
and
coriander
the
nose
also
has
some
lemon
and
the
slightest
honey
note
flavor
is
crisply
saison
with
a
good
bittering
addition
of
hops
and
some
sweetness
from
the
yeast
it
seems
like
there
is
an
industrial
flavor
on
the
beer
i
cant
quite
place
not
unpleasant
good
long
musty
finish
the
beer
is
thin
with
high
and
lively
carb
with
a
watery
finish
good
stuff
not
sure
i
can
taste
the
honey
as
much
as
others
can
but
a
solid
beer
nonetheless
o
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
really
like
that
faint
honey
in
the
saison
very
nice
farmhouse
from
an
excellent
brewery
in
a
farmhouse
o
brewers
from
the
usa
have
a
tough
time
developing
good
saisons
and
at
times
i
think
it
may
be
a
lack
of
appreciation
for
the
style
this
brew
really
is
quite
nice
for
the
style
and
should
but
wont
get
points
for
being
american
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisions
i
believe
i
have
had
i
seem
to
like
balance
more
and
more
and
that
is
one
thing
this
beer
possesses
a
little
yeast
a
little
malt
a
little
bitterness
all
adding
up
this
is
an
immensely
drinkable
beer
and
very
enjoyable
all
year
round
its
tasty
light
fresh
and
satisfying
so
happy
to
have
a
chance
to
try
this
one
thank
goodness
my
boyfriend
is
from
new
england
i
have
really
enjoyed
each
style
of
saison
thus
far
from
hill
farmstead
anna
is
as
simple
as
the
others
but
perhaps
a
touch
less
impressive
rustic
and
engaging
but
not
as
honest
and
brilliant
as
the
other
siblings
similar
in
style
i
would
certainly
not
turn
down
another
glass
o
a
solid
saison
with
just
the
right
amount
of
honey
to
add
a
nice
touch
giving
a
nod
to
the
rich
local
agriculture
that
is
a
staple
of
vermont
o
goes
down
easy
very
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
very
nice
representation
of
style
i
often
forget
about
the
saison
style
this
isone
to
enjoy
for
a
bit
many
thanks
to
bhollas

would

again
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
brews
i
have
a
bottle
of
arthur
in
the
fridge
that
is
calling
for
me
next
a
superb
saison
i
would
love
to
have
the
opportunity
to
drink
more
and
more
of
this
o
this
is
aboveaverage
but
against
hill
farmsteads
other
saisons
it
doesnt
climb
into
uppertier
territory
o
well
balanced
saison
low
in
the
funk
department
high
in
the
fruity
lemon
department
notes
a
wonderfully
bright
saison
with
great
refreshing
length
and
texture
o
a
good
saison
but
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
tasted
this
one
alongside
hfs
flora
and
just
felt
flora
was
much
more
complex
and
nuanced
where
as
anna
felt
a
little
flat
and
uninteresting
medium
body
maybe
a
little
heavier
than
usual
but
not
by
much
nice
coating
mouthfeel
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
a
brewer
who
uses
malts
hops
as
if
they
were
paint
on
a
canvas
excellent
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
spoke
with
a
trading
partner
about
some
of
the
beers
i
brought
in
with
my
haul
from
pete
he
said
anna
was
his
least
favorite
of
the
beers
i
received
how
much
better
can
the
others
be
o
good
saison
complex
fruity
funky
spicy
and
refreshing
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
hill
saisons
after
having
this
one
this
guy
gushed
a
little
bit
but
not
too
much
after
settling
it
pours
a
hazy
paleish
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
lemon
zest
orange
zest
and
mandarin
orange
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
tart
lemon
wheat
light
coriander
and
orange
rind
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
but
one
that
doesnt
really
express
itself
all
that
much
its
solid
but
bordering
on
boring
i
hope
that
makes
sense
to
somebody
else
out
there

o
a
really
nice
saison
lots
of
different
flavors
going
on
all
of
which
are
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
it
had
a
lot
of
great
flavors
to
it
but
managed
to
stay
pretty
well
balanced
at
the

present
in
the
nose
but
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
more
downplayed
theres
more
citrus
and
rind
and
less
coriander
but
the
medicinalherbal
character
seems
more
interspersed
throughout
the
flavor
profile
compared
with
the
nose
theres
also
a
slight
peppery
quality
that
comes
out
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
an
assertive
palate
cleansing
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
prickly
finish
is
not
quite
semidry
but
you
definitely
get
something
to
that
effect
at
the
tail
end
all
and
all
a
very
pleasant
and
interesting
saison
perhaps
a
little
too
on
the
clean
side
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
well
worth
your
time
if
you
enjoy
the
style
id
be
curious
to
see
what
a
little
age
might
do
to
this
one
o
my
2nd
hf
saison
was
considerably
better
than
the
first
that
being
florence
and
this
is
a
great
saison
definitely
on
the
high
end
of
the
spectrum
and
further
proof
that
hf
pretty
much
knocks
every
beer
style
they
brew
out
of
the
park
every
hill
farmstead
beer
ive
had
to
date
has
been
good
to
excellent
and
this
is
no
exception
their
beers
have
a
distinct
character
to
them
that
im
wondering
if
it
comes
from
their
well
water
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
light
saison
and
the
honey
adds
an
interesting
element
o
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
thanks
again
michael
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
earthy
bready
yeast
adding
fullness
to
the
palate
slightly
funky
but
not
too
much
so
with
hits
of
grassy
hops
and
straw
as
well
as
a
lot
of
crisp
light
fruit
hints
of
apple
pear
and
banaba
add
to
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
spicy
presence
with
hints
of
coriander
and
pepper
linger
into
a
dry
finish
complex
flavorful
and
refreshing
easy
easy
drinking
smooth
like
honey
without
any
of
the
sticky
overwhelming
sweetness
anna
is
really
kind
of
bad
ass
just
maybe
no
more
no
barnyard
no
funk
just
zest
honey
pepper
easy
drinking
goodness
pours
a
moderate
honey
golden
color
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
great
retention
and
loads
of
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
thin
cap
throughout
the
nose
carries
some
light
earth
and
spice
mild
white
pepper
in
the
background
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweet
honey
light
wheat
and
bread
notes
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
mildly
sweet
with
a
nice
malt
touch
and
a
bit
of
light
honey
flavor
saison
yeast
is
there
as
well
as
slight
pepper
light
to
medium
body
and
slightly
chewy
very
tasty
light
and
crisp
feel
the
carbonation
is
a
little
expansive
in
my
mouth
but
otherwise
solid
overall
a
pretty
rockin
saison
another
well
done
beer
from
the
folks
in
vermont
another
winner
from
these
guys
their
saisons
always
hit
the
spot
o
this
was
my
first
beer
from
their
house
and
not
a
style
i
usually
go
for
but
this
was
delicious
stuff
thoroughly
enjoyed
would
definitely
drink
again
if
the
chance
came
pours
a
chilled
golden
lemon
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
thick
clumps
of
lacing
and
never
ending
retention
smells
like
a
slightly
sweet
funky
barnyard
dominated
by
pepper
clove
and
lemongrass
and
backed
up
by
a
surprising
punch
of
candy
like
honey
medium
bodied
soft
and
delicate
on
the
palate
but
doesnt
finish
as
crisp
or
dry
as
expected
for
the
style
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
other
nonba
hf
saisons
and
has
a
traditional
earthy
musty
and
funky
finish
strong
grass
biscuit
malt
and
earthy
flavors
complement
a
surprisingly
noticeable
amount
of
honey
another
solid
saison
from
hf
with
a
subtle
enjoyable
twist
a
beautiful
nose
when
popped
of
brisk
hopping
this
is
the
high
light
in
my
opinion
because
as
the
beer
opens
up
it
give
way
to
some
interesting
floral
grassy
notes
that
are
actually
very
similar
to
dandelion
and
when
i
think
saison
i
think
two
things
honey
and
dandelion
greens
look
is
formally
perfect
golden
clear
if
you
dont
let
it
blend
with
the
settlings
big
white
head
with
bubbles
that
are
a
bit
soapier
than
cotton
candy
palate
is
unique
i
that
it
has
a
nice
hint
of
acidic
brightness
and
bitter
greens
very
much
so
like
a
field
in
flavor
the
honey
gives
it
a
hint
of
pollen
protein
texture
that
is
sort
of
grainy
there
is
some
adjunct
huskiness
but
nothing
too
overwhelming
the
quality
and
feel
of
most
the
farmstead
beers
all
around
solid
but
still
american
overall
a
good
saison
with
a
great
nose
o
another
great
brew
from
hill
farmstead
man
shaun
can
brew
like
a
champ
one
of
the
better
saisons
this
side
of
the
pond
d
id
prefer
art
over
this
one
but
this
is
a
rocksolid
take
on
the
style
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
any
time
goes
down
quickly
and
easily
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
spicy
yeast
the
honey
is
very
subtle
but
i
think
i
prefer
that
anna
came
to
me
looking
quite
like
her
sister
flora
anna
is
a
bright
saison
with
a
shade
darker
than
flora
looking
bright
yellow
with
a
slight
shade
of
orange
a
nice
whisp
of
bright
white
bubbles
on
top
leaving
squiggly
lines
here
and
there
the
nose
is
quite
bright
with
citrus
and
a
dab
of
honey
but
this
is
one
brettyfunky
lady
i
mistaked
it
for
bullfrog
undead
ed
because
of
the
scent
of
brett
but
this
is
indeed
anna
come
to
think
of
it
brett
rules
this
one
the
brett
comes
out
in
taste
in
full
and
is
not
messing
around
it
reminds
me
of
flora
because
the
lemon
is
big
as
well
which
plays
nice
with
the
brett
cant
really
pick
up
the
honey
under
all
of
that
as
expected
the
body
was
light
and
refreshing
other
than
the
brett
aftertaste
and
the
carb
was
spot
on
semi
tart
finish
but
dry
as
a
bone
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
did
not
love
it
i
would
marry
flora
while
i
would
make
anna
my
girl
on
the
side
for
a
piece
every
now
and
then
lol
all
and
all
spot
on
for
style
and
taste
well
done
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
but
tasting
it
back
to
back
with
flora
did
it
a
disservice
a
nice
and
spicy
saison
thats
worth
a
shot
o
anna
is
an
exceptionally
well
brewed
beer
that
is
solid
in
every
aspect
of
the
word
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
highly
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
and
highly
recommended
even
for
someone
who
isnt
a
big
fan
of
the
saison
style
quite
enjoyable
very
bright
in
the
nose
and
raw
yet
strangely
finessed
in
the
mouth
i
wish
it
popped
as
much
in
the
taste
as
in
the
nose
but
its
hard
to
argue
with
qua
bière
de
miel
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
saison
and
the
honey
addition
is
showcased
nicely
without
being
overdone
definitely
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
in
the
new
england
area
and
another
solid
offering
from
hill
farmstead
seems
like
they
never
miss
on
a
single
beer
i
wont
have
any
problem
finishing
the
rest
of
this
bottle
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
makes
me
think
of
spring
d
loved
this
beer
went
back
to
the
bottle
a
few
times
on
it
and
would
love
to
drink
it
again
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
brew
to
boot
d
an
excellent
saison
that
i
really
enjoyed
another
great
brew
from
hf
and
i
would
def
recommend
this
one
i
look
forward
to
having
this
again
a
very
solid
saison
recommend
my
first
taste
was
prior
to
eating
dinner
chicken
piccata
my
wife
uses
a
good
amount
of
lemon
in
her
recipe
after
eating
a
bit
and
trying
the
beer
again
it
seemed
that
the
citrus
on
my
palate
was
muted
from
the
piccata
and
the
beer
was
smoother
at
the
end
possibly
a
good
pairing
even
though
food
should
amplify
beer
not
mute
the
flavors
hv
appearance
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
annas
smell
has
citrus
some
honey
herbs
the
taste
has
honey
belgian
yeast
grapefruit
some
overall
funk
to
it
too
mf
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
this
saison
from
hill
farmstead
is
very
nice
would
order
again
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
it
was
my
first
beer
from
hill
farmstead
glad
that
i
got
to
sample
them
nice
dry
slightly
tart
finish
solid
beer
overall
interesting
to
say
the
least
taste
is
really
well
done
its
dry
and
sharp
and
crisp
a
bit
sweet
from
the
honey
but
its
suble
theres
a
nice
bittertart
taste
thats
really
crisp
delicious
highly
enjoyable
saison
that
you
cant
go
wrong
with
check
it
out
another
great
shelf
saison
from
hill
farmstead
super
tasty
phenomenal
beer
beautiful
pale
straw
color
with
the
slightest
orangepink
hue
the
acidity
of
the
lime
and
sweet
acidity
of
the
blood
orange
balance
amazingly
with
the
light
brett
character
would
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
very
good
saison
with
interesting
funkiness
based
on
the
advertised
specialty
ingredients
i
did
expect
a
bit
more
those
could
have
been
left
off
the
bottle
and
dont
seem
to
add
much
to
it
base
beer
is
good
though
brother
soigne
pours
a
super
hazy
straw
color
the
smell
is
pretty
straightforward
saison
with
some
lime
zestcitrus
rind
much
more
complex
taste
especially
as
it
warms
the
mimosalike
citrus
qualities
and
lively
champagnelike
carbonation
play
real
well
with
the
barnyardy
brett
funk
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
i
would
seek
this
out
again
and
again
really
benefits
from
warming
as
the
blood
orange
was
only
noticeable
near
room
temperature
otherwise
its
a
fairly
good
saison
with
too
much
of
a
lime
presence
that
overwhelms
what
i
can
only
assume
is
a
nice
saison
beneath
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
almost
watery
with
a
light
feel
zesty
champagne
like
carbonation
and
a
mild
funky
taste
that
kicks
in
before
the
sour
and
tart
finish
which
is
on
the
clean
side
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
great
light
farmhouse
ale
that
was
perfect
in
its
simplicity
as
it
was
just
complex
enough
to
be
different
with
every
sip

at
the

one
of
the
best

ive

definitely
worth
seeking

this

a
light

with
a
modest

it

drinkable

it
almost
felt
like

overall
this
is
a
great
tasty
grassy
saison
really
well
done
and
wonderful
for
the
summer
months
but
great
any
time
the
citrus
comes
through

o
shaun

is
a
master
just
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
wonderfully
executed
saison
base
further
amplified
by
the
citrus

and
brett

every
flavor
works
in

the

the
tart

of
the
beer
is
so
well
executed
and
the
lime
flavors
are
quite
enjoyable
while
layering
over
the
traditional

flavors
the
beer
is
bright
delicate
and
very
refreshing
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
of
this
style
an
absolutely
beautiful
beer
with
funk
and
tons
of

an

i
would
love
to
have
some
of
this
to
call
my
own
brother

is
a
damn
fine
saison
from
hill
farmstead
theres
a
really
enjoyable
rustic
quality
with
the
traditional
esters
a
touch
of
wildflower
like
funk
and
thirst
quenching
drinkability
thanks
again
for
the
bottle
ryan
od
a
nice
little
beer
good
drinkability
had
no
problem
with
the
bottle
size
nice
funk
presence
too
and
the
lime
was
subtle
but
enjoyable
well
put
together
overall
awesome
beer
great
brett
characters
that
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
more
lime
than
i
expected
and
a
great
character
from
it
nice
sourness
and
tart
characters
decent
saison
base
effervescent
etc
the
only
real
issue
i
found
was
that
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
and
as
a
ba
i
met
in
vermont
said
do
not
sleep
on
brother
soigne
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
at
a
great
price
point
of
10
for
a
750ml
i
would
have
bought
a
lot
more
than
2
bottles
had
i
realized
how
good
it
was
the
amount
of
bitter
lime
and
orange
flavors
in
this
brew
might
be
overkill
for
some
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
crisp
refreshing
and
immensely
flavorful
this
saison
would
make
for
a
perfect
summer
sipper
o
grassroots
packs
a
wallop
of
rustic
flavor
into
an
easydrinking
low
abv
saison
for
an
exceptional
take
on
the
style
lime
and
blood
orange
citrus
blend
beautifully
with
airy
floral
aspects
and
spicy
yeast
esters
finishing
with
dry
tartness
encapsulating
this
harmonious
unique
saison
o
incredibly
drinkable
with
a
flavor
profile
i
could
never
get
sick
of
arthur
is
my
favorite
saison
this
may
be
my
favorite
saison
with
adjuncts
medium
body
with
crisp
carbonation
and
a
blast
of
overwhelmingly
sour
tart
citrus
flavor
there
is
a
ton
of
lime
flavor
which
almost
completely
obliterates
the
farmhouse
and
saison
characteristics
intensely
dry
and
puckering
citrus
flavor
like
a
few
ounces
of
lime
juice
was
dumped
into
the
bottle
all
lime
juice
and
citrus
zest
slightly
peppery
and
spicy
but
after
a
while
when
the
palate
adjusts
the
saison
notes
very
subtly
start
to
show
up
subtle
farmhouse
funk
spicy
hops
and
tropical
fruit
grassy
with
faint
barnyard
character
but
again
the
citrus
is
so
strong
and
overpowering
it
kills
off
everything
that
i
enjoy
about
the
style
needs
balance
and
has
way
too
much
citruslime
flavor
very
disappointing
o
overall
i
loved
this
saison
alot
favorite
non
barrel
done
saison
from
shaun
hands
down
just
wish
the
appearance
was
better
is
this
a
typical
saison
not
even
close
but
again
it
is
just
delicious
very
unique
and
very
well
crafted
overall
this
was
awesome
juicy
tart
fruit
bright
oak
and
5
make
this
rule
overall
the
lime
gives
it
a
tangy
finish
another
solid
saison
from
grassroots
overall
this
very
well
could
be
the
best
saison
that
i
have
ever
drank
this
beer
is
now
a
permanent
want
wasnt
sure
about
the
lime
part
of
this
beer
when
i
was
reading
the
label
but
limes
in
saisons
are
really
good
i
also
wish
that
the
blood
oranges
had
a
bigger
role
in
this
beer
but
i
was
really
happy
with
the
overall
effect
of
this
beer
even
without
the
big
orange
flavors
very
tasty
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
the
tartness
is
moderate
you
wont
be
puckering
with
each
sip
cloudy
pour
pale
strawyellow
color
with
about
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
shrizzling
down
to
a
thin
ringlet
very
little
lacing
if
any
at
all
juicy
aroma
fresh
hops
and
lots
of
citrus
stone

yeast
lots
of

lemonlime

moderately

grassy

belgian

light
crackery

in
the
background
didnt
get
any
hibiscus
at
all
though
there
were
some
herbal
notes
in
there
medium
body
prickly
carbonation
nice
drinkability
very
nice
overall
and
probably
the
best
offering
from
grassroots
oanother
knockout
out
from
greensboro
their
saisons
are
practically
perfect
pours
a
light
orange
with
creamy
white
head
smells
of
citrus
funk
wheat
and
some
floral
notes
medium
carbonation
almost
creamy
body
taste
is
zesty
lime
and
orange
nice
refreshing
acidity
and
light
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
quite
refreshing
on
summer
time
o
a
fantastic
beer
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
citrus
in
this
beer
would
love
for
hf
to
make
this
frequently
or
at
least
again
d
great
beer
the
lime
makes
it
a
little
different
from
other
offerings
ive
had
from
grassroots
and
hill
farmstead
but
it
carries
over
the
consistently
great
elements
of
beers
like
art
and
anne
could
easily
drink
a
750ml
bottle
on
my
own
and
would
happily
drink
this
again
this
beer
is
just
a
step
below
perfect
unmistakably
a
shaun
hill
beer
this
is
the
essence
of
saison
bottled
the
nose
is
lively
and
appetizing
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
the
feel
is
just
spot
on
in
every
way
really
an
awesome
beer
all
the
way
around
o
another
hit
from
the
hfgrassroots
crew
i
drank
one
about
a
month
after
release
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
nearly
as
tart
as
this
although
i
think
it
has
improved
that
being
said
drink
it
now
this
is
a
simply
amazing
experience
o
tart
and
funky
lime
and
orange
with
subtle
barrel
very
light
and
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
definite
recommend
try
and
i
would
get
again
if
had
the
opportunity
m
medium
body
dry
moderate
carbonation
o
my
first
grassroots
brew
and
color
me
impressed
i
knew
that
hill
farmsteads
influence
would
ensure
that
this
saison
would
be
good
and
i
was
not
disappointed
a
perfect
summer
brew
for
a
hot
afternoon
o
really
let
this
baby
warm
up
to
showcase
the
strengths
because
this
beer
doesnt
have
too
many
weaknesses
if
any
incredibly
delicious
stuff
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
quite
possibly
my
favorite
non
barrelaged
saison
from
hill
farmstead
just
delightful
everything
in
this
beer
is
so
delicate
and
well
put
together
it
simply
works
nothing
is
in
your
face
or
overpowering
the
other
flavors
refreshing
clean
and
crisp
seek
this
out
o
another
good
saison
from
hfgrassroots
very
unique
flavor
profile
and
well
put
together
o
a
fantastic
saison
has
much
of
that
traditional
saison
quality
with
a
bit
of
new
influence
mixed
in
extremely
refreshing
crisp
beer
would
absolutely
drink
this
over
and
over
again
zesty
citrus
aromas
of
lime
and
orange
a
little
bit
of
yeast
complexity
reminded
me
of
fantome
a
little
bit
tart
fruit
flavor
saison
base
comes
through
nicely
again
like
a
fantome
saison
traces
of
lime
and
mimosa
finishes
dry
with
lingering
complex
flavors
medium
bodied
but
light
and
easy
drinking
recommended
omy
preference
is
still
convivial
suarez
but
definitely
give
this
a
try
o
sooo
nice
this
is
gonna
be
in
my
top
hf
saisons
for
sure
theres
a
lot
going
but
you
can
easily
pick
out
one
thing
from
another
i
love
how
they
manage
the
complexity
of
their
brews
this
is
seriously
solid
saison
enthusiasts
make
sure
you
seek
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
drying
overall
a
tasty
twist
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
may
be
a
bit
heavy
on
the
lime
at
times
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
refreshing
beverage
o
slowly
siason
is
coming
up
as
one
of
my
favorite
styles
next
to
porter
ipa
and
wheat
every
sip
is
a
gamble
always
feel
like
you
are
tasting
the
wonderful
yeasts
that
make
the
magic
happen
because
godisgood
im
not
saying
this
is
a
perfect
beer
but
each
individual
thing
im
analyzing
is
damn
near
perfect
to
make
me
happy
so
glad
i
took
a
gamble
on
this
for
some
reason
siason
is
kind
of
hard
to
find
note
poured
from
a
22

pours
that
murky
hazy
pale
sunset
fog
that
makes
me
salivate
the
aroma
quickly
reveals
the
funky
characteristics
i
so
crave
the
taste
delivers
funkier
fruitier
and
more
delicious
with
each
sip
refreshing
and
satisfying
a
must
enjoyable
bottle
and
glass
to
linger
over
orange
and
pineapple
maybe
a
little
past
ripe
dominate
the
finish
velvety
smooth
but
undefined
mouthfeel
this
beer
makes
the
day
better
has
elements
of
a
sour
particularly
the
smell
and
initial
sip
very
nice
subtle
blend
of
malt
and
oak
with
a
lemon
aftertaste
very
refreshing
although
not
the
most
complex
o
this
beer
is
amazing
the
best
saison
i
think
ive
ever
had
what
a
special
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
straight
up
brett
experiences
i
have
had
in
some
time
sunny
blonde
beer
with
some
appropriate
yeast
haze
and
a
tall
white
airy
head
that
rises
well
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
and
clings
on
for
ages
tart
and
funky
is
the
nose
with
citrus
in
there
too
more
brett
than
saison
yeast
and
just
the
right
hop
selection
and
dosage
for
this
beer
to
be
bitterly
balanced
but
yeast
not
hop
flavored
predominantly
not
often
i
get
a
beer
of
this
depth
and
quality
just
so
alive
on
the
palate
with
the
brett
getting
a
little
puckery
later
on
wet
grass
and
orchard
fruit
notes
come
from
the
saison
yeast
and
the
wheat
malt
base
seems
the
perfect
vehicle
for
these
light
summery
interesting
flavors
to
link
up
one
of
the
most
dry
saisons
i
can
recall
with
the
brett
reconditioning
being
fully
complete
im
left
refreshed
and
intrigued
and
thirsty
for
more
i
love
when
beer
makes
me
this
happy
pours
hazy
and
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
fingers
of
white
fluffy
head
falling
to
a
thin
color
the
nose
is
soft
and
complex
with
lots
of
floral
notes
lemon
citrus
and
hints
for
farmy
brett
on
the
palate
this
beer
really
opened
up
as
it
warmed
it
featured
again
lots
of
floral
and
spice
notes
lemon
peel
white
pepper
some
nice
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
more
and
more
brett
as
it
warmed
the
body
was
smooth
with
a
nice
carbonation
keeping
it
light
and
refreshing
a
really
nice
version
of
the
style
complex
and
enticing
overall
pretty
good
saison
nice
funk
and
tartness
but
would
like
to
have
seen
the
bitterness
turned
down
a
bit
as
i
feel
like
it
doesnt
really
work
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
still
worth
picking
up
though
o
really
well
made
with
intriguing
complexities
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
pale
yellow
with
a
peppy
white
head
i
know
the
beer
is
whats
important
but
id
appreciate
some
better
bottle
art
damp
hay
funk
and
floral
aroma
tastes
crisp
dry
and
funky
with
lemon
floral
herbal
sweetness
sourdough
and
more
one
of
those
beers
that
changes
as
it
warms
and
you
can
fish
for
new
flavors
and
flavor
combinations
throughout
the
bottle
this
is
a
stunning
saison
im
getting
repetitive
here
but
the
combination
of
different
flavors
and
characteristics
is
fantastic
varied
but
it
all
works
together
nearly
perfectly
wow
overall
a
pretty
solid
creation
between
the
two
breweries
i
like
this
grassroots
project
overall
such
a
refreshing
drinkable
beer
for
that
this
is
incredibly
well
done
nice
light
hop
malt
and
grassy
flavors
make
this
one
a
fantastic
summer
beer
ironic
that
it
is
arctic
in
the
name
o
moderately
complex
and
nicely
original
overall
awesome
not
the
best
to
look
at
but
aroma
and
flavor
characters
are
awesome
nice
brett
funk
pineapple
and
citrus
creamy
wheat
bitterness
lemony
etc
just
great
overall
light
fresh
and
interesting
enough
too
bad
its
kinda
expensive
would
pour
gallons
down
my
throat
in
this
summery
weather
o
overall
a
fantastic
beer
with
brett
i
loved
it
tons
of
brett
and
tropical
fruits
well
worth
seeking
out
would
love
to
have
it
again
im
basically
forcing
myself
to
start
liking
sours
this
was
one
really
nice
and
im
really
getting
into
them
o
well
balanced
saison
quite
complex
and
quite
drinkable
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
one
as
much
as
i
really
did
but
it
sure
did
surpass
my
expectations
worth
seeking
imo
can
anchorage
and
hill
farmstead
brew
this
again
maybe
make
it
year
round
this
lays
down
terrifically
well
and
is
totally
worth
the
18
price
tag
i
paid
for
this
is
a
prime
example
of
how
farmhouse
beers
in
america
are
only
getting
better
and
when
everything
is
done
properly
towards
a
beers
profile
the
addition
of
brett
only
makes
everything
more
complex
rustic
and
unique
i
really
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
see
how
its
progressing
but
i
honestly
think
the
sweet
spot
is
68
months
terrific
wonderful
stuff
really
exceeded
my
expectations
in
many
ways
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
the
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
this
is
remarkably
flavorful
with
a
ridiculous
amount
of
brett
and
an
aboveaverage
amount
of
funk
i
need
to
buy
more
of
this
a
damn
fine
saison
the
yeast
runs
a
bit
heavy
on
the
belgian
influence
but
everything
else
is
spot
on
o
drinks
very
well
great
brett
forward

for
me
wonderful

opened
another
bottle
now
that
it
has
been
developing
for
a
few
months
like
i
thought
this
is
considerably
better
now
i
can
recommend
this
beer
now
with
a
straight
face
i
highly
recommend
this
one
delicious
and
interesting
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
the
balance
of
the
earthy
wheat
tones
the
bright
lemony
hops
and
the
yeast
all
come
together
in
a
subtle
yet
complex
package
that
is
eminently
drinkable
and
at
6
it
really
is
i
will
try
this
one
again
in
a
year
or
two
and
see
if
the
brett
development
makes
it
even
more
interesting
o
rich
and
bold
but
still
well
rounded
and
a
pleasant
easy
drink
everything
is
well
integrated
now
so
i
wonder
how
it
will
develop
over
time
bright
dry
and
very
refreshing
a
very
nice
saison
indeed
extremely
crisp
with
mineral
water
and
tangy
lemon
taking
the
stage
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
on
a
brisk
28
degree
november
night
o
even
being
a
gusher
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
the
incident
didnt
take
anything
away
from
the
drinking
experience
grassrootshf
anchorage
can
do
no
wrong
grassroots
saisons
have
been
every
bit
as
good
as
their
hill
farmstead
offerings
and
arctic
saison
continues
that
trend
super
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
trying
bottom
line
excellent
hill
farmstead
family
brew
i
found
this
saison
to
be
an
approachable
and
sessionable
beer
and
would
serve
as
a
great
introduction
to
saisons
for
the
uninitiated
the
beer
is
clear
and
golden
yellow
with
over
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
brings
funk
lemons
floral
notes
mineral
water
earthy
tones
similar
flavor
finishing
dry
a
tasty
beer
mild
brett
and
oak
throughout
not
the
most
exciting
saison
but
certainly
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
i
was
tempted
to
say
that
this
a
fairly
straightforward
oak
brett
saison
but
that
sounds
foolish
overall
great
stuff
wish
i
picked
up
a
few
more
but
happy
to
have
tried
it
o
excellent
i
did
think
it
was
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
though
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
two
finger
white

with
good
retention
and
pillowy

finishing
with

and

light

with
nice
active
carbonation
a
lot
going
on
here
lots
of
sour
citrus
fruit
and
a
moderate
amount
of
brett
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
but
should
please
tasters
who
like
a
tart
bretty
saison
overall
quite
nice
but
not
remarkable
o
enjoyable
brew
really
lets
your
palate
know
its
there
better
than
expected
o
decent
more
sour
and
funky
than
im
used
to
in
a
saison
this
leans
wild
without
being
outofcontrol
half
a
bottle
of
this
was
pretty
pleasant
o
its
a
simple
clean
tart
filled
saison
i
like
it
for
the
simplicity
of
it
o
this
was
a
fantastic
tart
bretty
saison
that
was
flavorful
clean
refreshing
with
a
nice
tartness
in
my
opinion
this
is
probably
the
best
shaun
hill
collaboration
that
was
brewed
and
bottled
outside
of
vermont
congrats
to
darren
and
shaun
for
crafting
yet
another
great
saison
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
especially
since
its
distributed
fairly
widely
light
body
and
heavily
carbonated
but
very
soft
on
the
tongue
really
dries
out
your
mouth
pretty
interesting
wild
saison
but
the
saison
yeast
seems
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
the
wild
counterparts
and
the
hopping
o
a
very
tartsourfunky
saison
too
much
pretty
much
overshadows
the
normal
saison
characteristics
and
not
in
a
good
way
its
not
horrible
but
not
great
either
i
drainpoured
it
not
worth
teh
calories
overall
an
excellent
saison
o
like
the
sankt
hans
huge
difference
in
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
up
sourness
may
be
a
little
too
weak
after
30
consuming
no
were
than
50
is
probably
what
i
would
suggest
going
forward

some

the

at
this

light

and
delicious
drying
on
the

with
a
mild
oak
tannin
bite
that
works
really
well
with

there
are
also
flavors
of

a
carbonic

light
in

this
beer
is
mostly
great
but
does
feel
a
touch
watery
at
times
still
this
is
an
exceedingly
enjoyable
beer
refined
stuff
a
solid

nothing
unexpected

3
grassroots
beers
ive
had
have
been
slightly
underwhelming
m
medium
body
dry
moderate
carbonation
overall
solid
saison
very
good
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
but
if
youre
wary
of
the
price
you
might
just
stick
with
dupont
worth
trying
for
sure
and
that
nose
is
the
best
ive
ever
sniffed
on
a
saison
but
it
kind
of
falls
short
when
it
comes
to
that
flavour
profile
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
really
good
smelling
saison
dupont
the
one
we
drink
in
belgium
not
the
imported
crap
o
solid
saision
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
like
liquid
springtime
in
a
bottle
o
very
solid
summer
beer
verdict
a
very
nice
saison
from
grassrootsanchorage
i
really
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
from
both
breweries
and
its
clear
that
shauns
vision
came
to
fruition
here
a
really
palatable
saison
that
is
both
earthy
and
rustic
but
a
little
wild
while
it
doesnt
offer
up
much
in
the
way
of
over
the
top
complexity
or
risk
taking
its
very
refined
for
a
simple
straightforward
saison
i
do
wish
that
there
was
a
woodiness
to
it
which
is
a
great
signature
of
both
breweries
o
i
am
skeptical
of
all
beers
with
the
name
brett
in
description
because
they
tend
to
be
one
dimensional
and
thin
however
like
other
anchorage
products
this
finds
a
balance
that
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
and
at
the
same
time
fairly
complex
a
generally
approachable
saison
from
afar
of
course
until
your
taste
buds
acclimatize
if
they
ever
do
a
lot
going
on
here
the
wood
the
most
innocuous
of
the
bunch
while
the
guest
bacteria
does
what
it
does
best
and
the
citrusy
hops
do
well
to
keep
things
in
traditional
beer
territory
quite
well
made
this
one
is
and
definitely
worthy
of
seeking
out
especially
if
youre
an
avowed
funkhead
eh
greg
ogood
saison
wellmade
but
straightforward
overall
i
think
this
grassroots
beer
is
way
under
appreciated
it
is
very
hard
to
find
any
major
flaws
another
really
enjoyable
saison
what
a
jem
the
new
way
that
folks
like
anchorage
prairie
hill
farmstead
and
grassroots
have
reinvented
the
americanized
saison
style
is
truly
inventive
as
they
retain
whats
classic
about
traditional
farmhouse
taste
but
injecting
them
with
the
lively
character
of
citrusy
hops
they
simply
flirt
with
perfection
this
beer
was
a
little
sharper
than
i
wanted
it
to
be
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
probably
would
have
ranked
it
higher
if
i
hadnt
had
boulevards
saison
brett
the
day
before
overall
a
very
tasty
saison
one
with
a
good
amount
of
balance
with
the
fruit
and
hops
playing
leading
roles
i
would
like
a
little
more
funk
to
the
smell
and
taste
so
the
subdued
nature
of
that
element
is
the
only
drawback
o
really
like
this
beer
wish
i
would
of
grabbed
more
bottles
while
i
was
in
vermont
very
refreshing
beer
would
drink
again
in
a
second
overall
a
rocksolid
if
somewhat
middleoftheroad
saison
by
a
pair
of
brewing
masters
odit
starts
funky
and
wild
then
recomposes
itself
interesting
flavor
transition
i
enjoyed
it
ocould
have
been
more
on
the
sour
side
however
a
sweet
citrusy
saison
that
hit
the
spot
o
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
leans
too
far
towards
the
funk
and
oak
without
any
balance
to
bring
it
back
to
enjoyable
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
good
apple
notes
along
with
barnyard
well
done
collaboration
cc
which
is
fast
and
few
between
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
is
a
solid
saison
just
enough
funk
to
be
interesting
more
of
the
tropical
fruit
notes
which
are
nice
much
thanks

really
great
brew
and
glad
i
finally
got
to

it
on

now
to
just
get
a
bottle
for
the
basement
o
dangerously
drinkable
thirst
quenching
flavors
i
do
feel
this
will
shine
even
brighter
in
6
months
will
probably
revisit
in
12
because
of
my
fondness
for
brett
the
taste
begins
with
a
roasted
maltiness
but
just
like
the
aroma
the
citrus
grapefruit
tartness
kicks
in
from
behinds
and
remains
on
the
back
of
my
throat
for
a
few
moments

with
a
large

that

i
love
it

brett
with
some

and
tart
aromas
fresh

with
some
sharp

slightly

more
funky
than

love
the
aroma
on
this

is
initially
tarts

a
good

good
amount

is

crisp
and

is
very
high
overall
i
think
this
is
an
awesome
saison
that
certainly
lets
the
brett
shine
through
as
a
fresh
beer
i
would
still
like
to
buy
another
bottle
to
see
how
it
evolves
over
a
year
or
so
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
sessionable
beer
and
would
probably
do
well
on
a
sunny

day
pours
a

yelloworange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial

on

small
streaks

around
the
glass
on

down
smell
is
of

earth
yeast

taste
is
much
the
same
with
brett
and
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
brett
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
showcases
a
solid
earthy
brett
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
m
medium
bodied
richer
mouth
than
expected
o
i
tried
this
a
couple
of
times
and
can
say
this
is
a
truly
great
saison
it
has
a
near
perfect
balance
of
earth
spice
hops
and
sourness
reminiscent
of
fantome
saisons
ive
had
in
the
past
hats
off
to
a
near
perfect
saison
o
funk
and
tart
citrus
i
enjoyed
this
one
way
more
than
the
fist
bottle
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
saison
as
it
has
lots
of
brett
aromas
and
flavors
but
neither
of
which
are
overpowering
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
yummy
notes
of
of
funk
and
brett
with
a
nice
fruity
backdrop
with
some
slight
spice
d
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
it
started
out
well
but
didnt
quite
hold
up
a
decent
example
of
style
but
nothing
special
still
a
nicely
refreshing
and
solidly
sessionable
brew
would
go
well
at
your
next
picnic
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
but
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
quite
a
bit
it
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
saison
perfectly
suited
for
summer
not
the
best
grassrootshfabc
offering
but
very
good
either
way
o
i
love
how
you
can
really
tell
that
both
grassroots
and
anchorage
had
something
to
do
with
this
even
in
a
blind
tasting
im
sure
i
could
point
it
out
it
has
the
amazing
citrus
smoothness
and
carbonation
of
arthur
and
the
incredible
brett
characteristics
of
galaxy
white
ipa
ive
never
had
anything
from
either
of
these
breweries
that
hasnt
exceeded
my
expectations
jd
pours
bright
yellowgold
quite
cloudy
solid
white
head
good
sized
layer
of
foam
good
retention
some
lacing
the
aroma
has
fresh
grain
dusty
barnyard
some
light
stone
fruit
lemons
lots
of
brett
presence
clean
the
taste
adds
in
more
oak
than
expected
big
acerbic
woodiness
particularly
in
the
finish
its
mostly
pleasant
lots
of
clean
brett
flavor
some
apricots
and
citrus
peel
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
light
its
almost
a
touch
thin
for
my
taste
very
good
saison
but
a
touch
boring
with
so
many
others
coming
out
it
could
just
use
some
sort
of
twist
to
stand
out
c
moderate
but
distinct
brett
flavor
some
peppery
notes
pleasant
delicate
fruitiness
with
more
of
the
barnyard
funk
just
a
little
pineapple
and
some
pear
flavors
the
modest
bitter
aftertaste
is
just
right
for
the
light
body
and
dry
edge
there
might
be
a
faint
woodiness
but
i
dont
taste
the
alleged
oak
tank
fermentation
without
some
imagination
still
this
is
a
delicious
and
restrained
example
of
a
saison
and
i
like
this
brett
version
rather
than
the
often
overthetop
yeastiness
from
the
750
ml
bottle
bought
for
14
10
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
remembrances
from
last
night
when
consumed
right
after
la
vermontiose
no
where
near
as
dry
as
vermontoise
on
the
back
end
with
a
more
floral
fruity
characteristic
the
beer
pours
with
a
thin
head
for
a
saison
that
rapidly
dissipates
for
a
saison
without
much
lacing
left
behind
some
barnyard
but
not
wholly
pronounced
as
much
as
a
sweetness

disappears
as
the
beer
warms

the
more
dry

very

fairly

holds
its

the

love

complexity
and
like
the
spicing
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
complex
and
deep
my
only
qualm
is
with
the
finish
which
has
a
lingering
bitterness
that
cuts
against
the
integrated
harmony
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
not
a
huge
deal
but
enough
to
keep
me
from
elevating
this

ive
ever
had

of
the
beer
balances
out
the
dry
funky
brett
outstandingly
tasty
unique
and
complex
another
nice
creation
from
anchorage
opened
after
approximately
2
years
in
the
fridge
no
ill
effects
still
a
decent
head
with
plenty
of
sticky
lace
citrus
and
anchorage
has
to
have
one
of
the
best
beer
portfolios
out
there
they
are
all
so
clever
and
well
made
and
so
unique
too
love
buzz
is
a
real
treat
for
me
the
peppercorns
are
there
in
the
nose
and
blend
in
seamlessly
with
the
spice
of
the
saison
yeast
in
the
taste
the
orange
peel
does
the
same
thing
with
the
citra
hops
marrying
equally
and
synergistic
to
the
max
with
the
orange
adding
some
bitter
just
like
the
hops
do
and
the
hops
adding
the
citrus
thing
to
the
nose
the
yeast
complexion
is
amazing
mouthwatering
its
dry
but
wet
too
its
bretty
and
funky
and
odd
but
still
farmy
and
familiar
like
a
nap
in
a
hay
loft
hard
to
tell
if
its
the
red
wine
barrel
or
the
rose
hip
giving
it
a
perfume
floral
thing
before
the
finish
but
the
cherry
notes
of
the
wine
barrel
bring
it
back
to
earth
oak
and
funk
fruity
and
dry
its
as
complex
as
any
beer
out
there
and
just
as
well
made
too
i
love
all
of
the
anchorage
beers
but
this
one
may
well
be
my
favorite
what
an
extraordinary
specimen
pinot
noir
barreling
as
obvious
here
as
it
is
anywhere
and
this
ages
with
the
best
of
them
very
effervescent
medium
light
body
well
no
surprise
as
to
be
expected
from
anchorage
brewing
company
the
brewing
recipe
is
incredibly
fancy
and
uppitysounding
i
say
i
do
fancy
an
artisanal
ale
brewed
with
hobbs
family
rose
hips
and
aged
in
french
oak
pinot
noir
barrels
snobbishly
raises
monocle
and
the
beer
tastes
refined
yes
but
also
just
damn
good
to
put
it
simply
o
ive
had
this
before
and
remember
it
being
very
pleasant
a
good
beer
id
say
try
and
find
fresh
ive
had
it
sitting
a
couple
of
months
on
the
shelf
and
it
decayed
quite
a
bit
a
very
nice
saison
with
good
character
wow
this
bad
boy
is
fantastic
batch
3
this
gives
hf
a
run
for
their
saison
money
if
i
had
to
guess
this
is
what
ann
probably
taste
like
damn
near
perfection
everything
comes
up
really
well
pepper
is
real
nice
and
not
overly
done
amazing
beer
and
much
easier
to
get
than
hf
wine
barrelled
saisons
by
a
long
shot
try
this
beer
anchorage
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
love
buzz
the
nose
is
flat
out
amazing
there
is
layer
upon
layer
of
delicious
fruit
funk
barrel
rose
hips
and
more
its
an
all
around
great
beer
i
need
to
find
more
bottles
of
this
as
soon
as
possible
if
you
find
any
of
these
bottles
around
buy
them
all
overall
this
is
an
amazing
brew
as
you
can
expect
from
gabe
really
freakin
awesome
despite
a
fairly
underwhelming
hue
and
carbonation
this
is
a
well
balanced
sour
ale
the
nose
is
fine
blend
of
barnyard
funk
and
fresh
hops
a
little
different
than
the
usual
saison
the
wild
yeast
comes
through
again
on
back
of
the
tongue
and
is
joined
by
light
fruit
raspberries
perhaps
the
finish
is
dry
yet
lingers
overall
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
stuff
anywhere
really
a
very
very
nice
beer
not
much
to
complain
about
at
all
heck
my
roommate
who
is
not
much
of
a
beer
guy
was
disappointed
to
hear
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
get
this
again
easily
overall
a
solid
beer
the
fruit
sour
and
floral
saison
characteristics
add
complexity
to
this
beer
but
also
make
it
sort
of
muddled
especially
with
the
bitter
hopped
finish
i
would
prefer
a
stronger
sour
fruit
tartness
profile
overall
there
was
one
bottle
of
this
left
on
the
shelf
and
i
may
have
to
go
back
and
get
it
i
would
love
to
have
tried
this
brew
fresh
as
well
too
outstanding
complexity
and
a
truly
interesting
drinking
experience
o
my
not
deliver
if
expecting
normal
saison
qualities
but
im
in
love
750ml
bottle
that
i
shared
with
my
friend
keelan
these
anchorage
beers
arent
cheap
but
if
the
rest
are
like
this
one
i
am
up
for
moer
orangeyellow
color
small
but
visible
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
really
incredible
in
how
intriguing
it
is
i
knew
right
away
i
liked
it
but
i
just
have
to
keep
inhaling
away
to
try
and
figure
out
what
i
smell
this
beer
sets
the
standard
for
complex
aromas
its
sort
of
perfume
candy
a
touch
of
brett
hiding
in
the
back
slightly
earthy
slight
touch
of
alcohol
after
reading
the
bottle
it
came
to
me
its
the
rose
hips
the
taste
is
pretty
damn
crazy
too
funky
with
sweet
sour
and
bitter
all
in
equal
portions
unique
surprisingly
pleasant
this
one
is
fit
for
a
very
special
occasion
o
fantastic
beer
and
age
has
really
allowed
the
brett
to
develop
into
something
nice
but
i
think
any
further
and
the
light
wine
notes
that
are
still
present
may
no
longer
linger
drink
up
overall
a
beer
you
want
on
a
summer
evening
and
would
buy
again
o
delicious
and
extremely
refreshing
orange
peel
and
citra
hops
are
a
great
combination
o
a
very
enjoyable
saison
complex
flavor
and
aroma
smooth
8
subtle
but
enticing
and
far
from
bland
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
hue
decent
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
wheaty
and
grainy
and
fruity
light
and
wheaty
with
lots
of
fermented
raspberry
bitter
and
acidic
with
something
of
an
offputting
final
step
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
poured
into
a
sampler
snifter
the
saison
was
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
slight
white
head
with
huge
bubbles
the
aroma
was
anything
but
subtle
with
a
peppery
and
earthy
aroma
on
even
gets
notes
of
orange
in
the
aroma
in
the
initial
taste
one
detects
notes
of
mango
pineapple
tart
apples
a
hint
of
sour
candy
and
the
barnyard
funk
that
is
emblematic
of
the
style
as
the
taste
evolves
into
a
dry
tart
apple
taste
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
proves
to
be
smooth
and
perhaps
a
little
sticky
one
may
find
hisherself
wishing
the
taste
would
linger
a
little
longer
if
the
staying
power
disappoints
just
buy
another
bottle
this
is
really
good
stuff
o
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
before
they
somehow
created
the
perfect
balance
of
brett
hops
fruit
and
wine
barrel
i
never
got
any
peppercorn
out
of
it
but
im
sure
it
contributed
in
some
way
i
just
didnt
detect
a
stellar
saison
that
i
will
jump
at
the
chance
to
purchase
again
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
hoppy
saison
wild
ale
not
sure
what
i
would
characterize
this
as
but
its
delicious
if
the
aroma
matched
the
flavor
it
would
be
among
my
top
beers
but
very
good
nonetheless
this
is
up
there
with
boulevards
saison
brett
among
my
top
saisons
ever
im
blown
away
and
i
really
hope
they
make
this
again
if
only
the
taste
had
a
little
more
to
it
i
have
a
bomber
of
this
and
i
have
no
idea
how
im
going
to
finish
its
completely
obnoxious
im
hoping
the
relatively
high
abv
will
dull
my
senses
soon
overall
terrific
rich
and
enveloping
and
unique
a
very
tasty
beer
d
read
the
comments
above
certainly
different
than
your
typical
saison
but
the
complexities
make
for
a
very
unique
brew
certainly
a
costly
bottle
of
beer
but
it
was
fun
drinking
it
overall
perfect
beer
for
one
of
the
first
warm
spring
nights
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
anchorages
beers
they
nailed
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
satisfying
beer
it
seems
to
get
better
as
i
drink
it
apricot
ale
with
a
sheet
of
loose
knit
light
foam
smells
of
elderflower
initially
pepper
lemon
seltzer
some
grain
and
some
clay
just
a
touch
of
musty
trub
lightly
tart
quite
bitter
medicinal
some
bitter
orange
peel
a
little
bit
of
tart
and
the
aftertaste
is
really
grassy
and
filthy
to
me
medium
bodied
on
full
with
low
carb
and
dry
finish
a
little
too
bitter
and
overly
mutilated
by
the
brett
for
me
nose
is
really
satisfying
but
the
flavor
doesnt
do
it
for
me
bottle
poured
a
bright
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
brett
is
dominant
with
some
notes
of
rustic
malt
and
some
citrus
notes
and
some
vinous
notes
as
well
taste
is
a
complex
mix
between
some
brett
notes
with
a
dry
aftertaste
mix
in
with
citrusy
hoppy
notes
and
some
vinous
notes
which
work
very
well
altogether
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
again
lots
of
flavour
that
are
very
well
balanced
my
only
complaint
and
it
is
a
minor
one
ifs
with
the
amount
of
brett
used
in
every
of
their
beers
they
tend
to
have
a
similar
taste
profile
overall
an
excellent
take
on
saison
while
not
really
a
sour
beer
the
brett
gives
it
some
of
those
distinct
sour
characteristics
without
overwhelming
the
palate
i
might
recommend
this
as
a
way
for
those
who
dont
get
sours
to
try
so
they
can
taste
and
understand
some
the
components
of
that
type
of
beer
but
ultimately
this
is
a
saison
and
a
delicious
one
this
was
amazing
it
was
complex
and
absolutely
delicious
rarely
can
i
say
this
but
it
was
as
if
each
sip
had
a
new
flavor
there
were
so
many
subtleties
and
nuances
that
i
couldnt
even
wrap
my
palate
around
all
of
them
on
top
of
all
that
it
was
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
its
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
nice
beer
light
and
fresh
this
one
would
be
better
during
the
warmer
months
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
o
i
really
like
what
the
oak
and
pinot
noir
do
to
this
beer
but
i
think
it
overwhelms
the
beer
a
bit
especially
with
the
brett
funk
i
could
use
a
bit
more
traditional
saison
flavors
in
this
one
but
its
quite
nice
nonetheless
well
above
average
o
this
was
my
first
offering
by
anchorage
and
i
must
say
that
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
brew
drinkability
is
rather
high
complexity
is
nice
and
the
balance
is
great
going
back
for
more
of
this
for
sure
bravo
after
a
few
years
this
has
very
much
the
same
flavour
components
as
before
but
the
creaminess
adds
such
a
succulent
component
ive
had
nothing
like
it
yes
5s
around
as
no
one
imho
can
even
match
this
let
me
know
if
im
wrong
bestbar
none
love
buzz
is
hands
down
the
best
saison
this
guys
ever
had
not
a
big
saison
fan
opened
a
bomber
at
a
tasting
thanks
jacoby
pours
murky
yellow
with
a
little
white
head
the
pinot
noir
is
balanced
perfectly
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
kudos
to
anchorage
brewing
for
a
great
beer
overall
wow
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
very
delicious
and
a
smell
that
just
blew
me
away
highly
recomended
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
had
heard
good
things
but
wow
this
is
really
up
there
with
the
best
ive
ever
had
the
flavor
is
traditional
saison
with
lots
of
depth
and
added
flavors
and
feel
that
all
complement
each
other
well
i
really
cant
say
enough
about
how
well
crafted
this
is
buy
it
if
you
see
it
worth
every
drop
anchorage
is
really
moving
up
the
charts
with
each
beer
i
try
in
my
book
pretty
darn
tasty
and
complex
i
think
their
galaxy
white
ipa
is
still
my
favorite
but
this
one
came
close
to
topping
it
o
what
can
i
say
other
than
what
ive
already
said
incredible
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
try
once
and
think
about
for
years
afterward
its
fresh
fruit
in
the
nose
and
sweetsour
heaven
in
the
palate
a
combination
that
ive
never
experienced
before
and
i
doubt
i
will
ever
find
again
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
quite
complex
m
light
to
medium
body
dry
slightly
sticky
light
carbonation
despite
the
flowery
romance
novel
bs
on
the
label
the
beer
is
in
fact
pretty
decent
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
large
fluffy
chunky
head
on
top
that
eventually
settles
down
to
a
lumpy
covering
the
aroma
is
fantastic
citrus
peel
and
soft
floral
notes
upfront
peppery
spice
juicy
and
slightly
grassy
hops
yeast
esters
and
a
lovely
pale
malt
base
juicy
citrus
and
tart
fruit
sticks
to
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
stays
there
here
is
where
the
brett
reveals
itself
but
its
not
super
funky
lingering
peppery
bitterness
drying
wood
flower
petals
and
earth
some
winelike
tannins
perhaps
but
the
pinot
doesnt
really
come
through
in
any
significant
way
very
dry
and
quite
tart
yet
soft
and
fluffy
in
the
mouth
with
the
rose
hips
peppercorns
orange
peels
dry
hopping
barrel
aging
and
wild
yeast
this
could
be
a
total
mess
in
other
hands
this
guy
obviously
knows
what
hes
doing
good
stuff
d
i
would
session
this
in
a
second
the
saison
tastes
nicely
of
brett
and
fruity
with
a
subtle
citrus
tanginess
and
white
grape
tartness
from
the
barrel
with
mild
pepper
and
lemony
hop
qualities
w
slight
cracker
taste
of
malt
in
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
top
notch
example
of
a
brett
saison
with
nice
spice
and
hop
flavor
with
the
additon
of
a
white
wine
elment
from
the
barrel
augmentation
overall
the
beer
is
so
awesome
what
a
complex
saison
the
citra
hops
are
amplified
by
the
orange
peel
and
love
that
about
this
beer
geez
its
that
frickn
good
this
would
be
my
second
anchorage
beer
and
they
just
make
beers
with
crazy
complexity
and
just
are
killing
it
with
their
brews
terrific
beer
and
my
first
from
anchorage
i
really
can
taste
the
bright
orange
peel
and
rose
hips
in
this
which
leads
to
a
bright
and
exciting
saison
the
brett
pinot
barrels
and
citra
all
play
a
part
as
well
and
i
will
seek
out
their
other
brews
o
this
is
the
third
archorage
beer
ive
ever
had
and
id
buy
any
of
them
again
in
a
heart
beat
another
excellent
job
pushing
the
boundaries
of
contemporary
brewing
this
is
a
seriously
great
beer
its
1222
and
i
think
i
just
found
my
favorite
beer
of
2012
anchorage
has
got
this
brett
and
barrel
thing
down
o
i
was
hesitant
to
pick
this
up
with
the
cost
14
99
for
a
750
but
i
am
very
glad
that
i
did
amazing
complexity
and
great
drinkability
make
for
a
great
drinking
experience
highly
recommended
o
the
light
beer
has
a
full
flavor
and
complexity
that
is
unique
and
really
works
together
none
of
the
flavors
are
out
of
balance
and
it
makes
this
beer
really
drinkable
overwhelmingly
fruity
in
the
nose
love
buzz
begins
with
a
massive
bouquet
of
grapefruit
and
just
a
touch
of
tart
funk
as
if
anticipating
to
bite
into
the
melon
itself
the
smell
of
citrus
is
delightfully
simple
and
dominating
immediately
puckering
on
the
palate
citrus
and
tartness
follow
a
bit
peppery
indeed
but
lacking
the
caramel
beauty
promised
on
the
bottle
simple
tart
and
perhaps
better
paired
than
alone
love
buzz
neither
impresses
nor
disappoints
a
solid
offering
but
overall
not
memorable
750ml

14

these
anchorage
beers
arent
cheap
but
ive
had
good
experiences
with
bitter
monk
and
galaxy
ipa
so
im
becoming
a
believer
orangeyellow
color
small
but
visible
head
ans
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
really
incredible
in
how
intriguing
it
is
i
knew
right
away
i
liked
it
but
i
just
have
to
keep
inhaling
away
to
try
and
figure
out
what
i
smell
its
sort
of
perfume
candy
a
touch
of
brett
hiding
in
the
back
slightly
earthy
slight
touch
of
alcohol
great
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
damn
crazy
too
sort
of
sweet
dry
some
orange
pretty
good
i
must
say
these
anchorage
beers
are
quite
unique
and
while
they
seem
expensive
at
first
they
are
actually
priced
less
than
russian
river
and
about
equal
to
jolly
pumpkin
and
id
say
the
quality
is
not
questionable
cant
wait
for
the
next
batch
of
bitter
monk
great
barrel
aged
wild
saison
take
one
part
ipa
one
part
saison
and
one
part
sour
and
here
you
go
definitely
an
interesting
and
complex
beer
would
like
to
try
again
after
some
aging
o
out
of
the
three
anchorage
beers
ive
had
this
is
my
favorite
the
beer
is
more
subtle
than
most
barrelaged
beers
and
isnt
overly
funky
and
its
very
approachable
overall
cool
beer
enjoyed
this
theres
an
element
of
class
and
sophistication
associated
with
the
beer
yet
still
making
it
look
easy
the
beer
simply
comes
together
in
the
most
majestic
and
whimsical
way
but
its
power
and
punch
to
the
palate
wont
be
ignored
overall
this
is
an
awesomely
fruity
saison
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
couple
to
set
down
and
see
how
the
brettanomyces
plays
out
over
the
next
couple
of
years
o
this
beer
was
all
over
the
place
the
only
think
i
missed
was
the
pinot
maybe
my
palate
was
off
today
but
i
will
revisit
and
look
for
more
pinot
excellent
very
skilfully
done
the
brett
and
barrel
treatment
are
used
with
restraint
which
makes
for
impressively
coherent
complexity
and
great
drinkability
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
flavor
that
continues
to
build
as
it
sits
on
my
tongue
fruity
and
effervescent
gives
way
to
spices
and
funky
complex
yeast
top
notch
with
favor
on
top
of
flavor
finishes
with
a
spicy
peppery
dry
bite
great
beer
i
would
look
forward
to
having
more
one
word
potpourri
overall
this
beer
was
incredibly
unique
in
the
pairing
of
sour
and
saison
attributes
i
would
get
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
and
available
awesome
o
this
was
a
really
impressive
beer
solid
saison
with
barrel
aging
adding
to
it
grapes
fruits
spices
citrus
delicious
the
beer
appears
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
over
an
inch
of
dense
white
head
the
aroma
offers
fruit
yeast
malt
floral
notes
the
flavor
is
interesting
floral
hops
come
through
more
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
slightly
sweet
with
additional
notes
of
rose
hips
a
pretty
tasty
saison
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
ton
of
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
wonderfully
all
sorts
of
great
aromas
on
the
nose
including
fruity
brett
mountain
dew
pepper
the
body
is
dry
and
filled
with
brett
character
more
pepper
and
fruity
notes
along
with
a
vinous
quality
as
time
passes
it
is
detracted
by
the
building
bitterness
and
a
building
yeast
character
regardless
an
enjoyable
beer
a
fine
beer
to
enjoy
while
watching
the
allstar
game
overall
this
was
a
huge
miss
for
me
flavor
profile
was
all
phenolic
yeast
and
drying
oak
too
much
oak
even
for
me
and
i
love
oak
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
fruity
red
wine
presence
and
less
of
an
oaky
tannic
assault
with
how
expensize
these
offering
are
from
this
brewery
i
am
going
to
be
much
more
cautious
moving
forward
giving
i
only
semienjoyed
1
of
the
3
i
have
sampled
so
far
the
mouthfeel
is
superb
for
a
saison
dry
light
astringent
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
great
saison
everything
about
this
beer
apart
from
the
standard
appearance
is
fantastic
its
a
real
brewing
achievement
and
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
tasted
this
year
bottle
at
the
may
2012
iteration
of
the
santa

than
the

sealed
it
and
finished
it
the
next
day
and
found
it
had
actually
improved
a
hit
regardless
this
beer
almost
made
me
cry
it
was
that
good
after
1200
reviews
this
has
become
the
beer
i
want
to
settle
down
with
in
the
country
and
somehow
engineer
a
mutant
beerhuman
hybrid
family
with
despite
gilbert
yapping
away
in
my
ear
about
gastronomic
subjugation
or
some
shit
i
cant
give
it
anything
besides
a
perfect
score
overall
this
is
a
complex
interesting
saison
to
pick
apart
enjoyed
it
not
an
everyday
beer
though
d
very
drinkable
the
brett
adds
a
really
nice
funky
layer
to
the
saison
base
that
winds
up
nice
and
complex
and
balanced
finish
is
really
nice
o
unpleasant
and
overly
herbal
this
is
an
easy
drinking
sour

definitely

with

a

on
the

scale
of

this
is
very
far
from
the
floralyeastspice
range
the
sour
dominates
both
aroma
and
body
this
is
more
close
to
a
lambic
than
most
other
saisons
i
have
tried
o
overall
nice

brett
up
front
with
flavors
of
spices
flowers
and
wood
coming
through
on
the
finish
there
is
a
dry
tart
and
slightly
funky
aftertaste
as
well
this
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
quite
a
complex
and
tasty
saison
the
brett
presence
really
shines
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
other
ingredients
this
beer
was
something
special
when
i
opened
it
and
poured
it
into
a
large
snifter
a
pretty
decent
foam
appeared
although
it
disappeared
after
not
so
long
it
looked
clear
and
amber
with
some
red
in
it
but
it
was
only
the
first
glass
which
was
clear
the
deeper
i
got
into
the
bottle
the
more
turbid
the
liquid
became
because
the
yeast
was
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
smelled
it
and
the
aromas
of
rose
hips
and
some
funk
revealed
itself
the
first
sips
were
wonderful
the
rose
hips
were
really
prominent
and
some
nice
fruity
sweetness
was
there
too
in
the
end
a
nice
rather
special
bitterness
took
hold
the
beer
continued
in
the
same
elegant
fashion
it
had
juicelike
qualities
and
some
real
freshness
to
it
the
brett
is
there
and
provides
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
and
some
subtle
sourness
and
also
some
funny
flavors
once
in
a
while
the
mouthfel
was
light
and
the
beer
was
easy
drinking
drank
a
whole
750
ml
for
myself
never
feeling
it
was
too
much
overall
a
beer
different
than
the
rest
it
was
more
alive
and
kicking
than
most
other
saisons
o
exceptional
very
refreshing
and
very
dry
healthy
doses
of
crisp
lemony
citrus
barnyard
and
hay
the
wine
and
oak
only
adds
to
its
complexity
not
as
sour
as
i
was
hoping
which
was
probably
for
the
best
phenomenal
all
around
i
will
be
picking
up
more
for
sure
try
this
beer
buy
it
then
buy
more
this
is
my
first
saison
and
i
am
going
to
have
more
overall
very
very
unique
beer
like
all
of
anchorages
beers
i
wish
it
was
summer
so
i
could
fully
appreciate
how
refreshing
this
beer
is
o
a
very
nice
beer
my
first
from
anchorage
look
forward
to
trying
to
the
other
ones
at
some
point
the
only
problem
really
is
the
price
a
little
steep
but
somewhat
understandable
o
i
really
like
this
beer
just
not
the
price
of
it
it
makes
you
sit
back
and
take
notice
but
its
also
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
perfect
beer
for
those
looking
to
taste
a
little
funk
got
to
work
a
trade
for
more
of
these
this
is
a
nice
saison
even
thought
its
a
bit
different
o
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
style
especially
when
the
brewer
adds
plenty
of
interesting
things
to
it
this
is
easily
on
par
with
most
of
jolly
pumpkins
beers
really
cool
beer
that
id
been
wanting
to
try
impressive
unique
well
worth
seeking
out
especially
for
fans
of
the
style
really
an
excellent
saison
and
worth
seeking
out
although
dropping
17
for
a
bottle
of
this
seems
a
tad
unreasonable
recommended
overall
too
bad
this
is
a
limited
release
nice
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
dont
let
the
high
price
tag
put
you
off
8
is
too
high
to
be
sessionable
but
this
beer
goes
down
super
easy
and
is
very
enjoyable
spicy
sweet
with
a
light
refreshing
feel
really
good
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
like
what
the
brett
and
the
barrel
add
to
it
really
delicious
and
unique
ale
one
of
the
most
creative
domestic
examples
of
the
style
up
there
with
jolly
pumpkins

wow

another

the

can
be
anticipated
from
the

i
anticipated
but
still
offers

fantastic

great
hop
profile
here
a
touch
of
green

good
effervescence
on
the
palte
more
of
a
sweeter
saison
and
doesnt
really
have
that
tartpuckering
sensation
that
i
had
predicted
based
on
the
nose
delicious
and
severly
drinkable
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
i
would
readily
revisit
this
great
stuff
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
golden
color
with
some
orange
hues
to
it
the
head
was
thick
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
earthy
with
some
spicy
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
the
typical
spicy
saison
notes
with
some
light
earthy
undertones
the
mouthfeel
was
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
probably
drink
it
again

quickly
to
leave

s
a

and
a

some
of
the
brett
is
noticeable
as
well
very
complex
t
a
peppery
component
up
front
and
citrus
flavors
throughout
floral
flavors
come
on
last
and
it
mixes
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
very
nice
mix
of
flavors
m
medium
body
with
a
generous
carbonation
they
put
a
lot
of
love
into
this
and
it
shows
easily
one
of
the
best
saisons
that
ive
had
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
really
good
saison
complex
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
have
another
this
was
quite
good
the
brett
played
a
big
part
and
worked
well
with
the
spiciness
of
that
base
saison
that
barrel
flavor
was
only
the
icing
on
the
cake
i
think
that
the
body
on
this
really
impressed
me
the
most
though
perfectly
complimenting
those
flavors
this
is
another
solid
one
from
anchorage
o
a
really
good
beer
that
uses
brett
well
in
order
to
compliment
the
various
spices
in
this
saison
farmhouse
style
beer
the
body
is
light
and
full
of
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
complexity
in
the
flavors
anchorage
is
really
hitting
it
out
of
the
park
i
cant
wait
to
see
more
from
these
guys
and
a
few
bad
sips
with
off
flavors
did
not
help
either
despite
this
it
stays
true
to
its
rootsit
provides
perhaps
the
new
wave
in
saison
awesomeness
the
next
generation
of
a
phenomenal
style
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
soft
natural
carbonation
fairly
light
and
creamy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
very
fun
to
parse
but
one
for
thinking
not
slugging
down
im
really
liking
this
although
the
rose
it
a
bit
much
it
gives
it
a
potpourii
flavor
that
is
a
bit
fatiguing
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
8
a
little
more
bitter
than
id
like
but
just
because
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
doesnt
mean
i
didnt
enjoy
it
this
concluded
our
mini
tasting
of
3
different
anchorge
beers
and
i
gotta
say
that
across
all
3
different
offerings
these
brews
shared
a
vey
familiar
quality
about
them
im
not
sure
if
that
is
just
the
house
character
or
if
its
the
repeated
combination
of
brett
ad
barrel
aging
across
all
3
regardless
they
are
worth
checking
out
o
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
have
way
more
often
i
will
get
this
any
time
i
can
which
is
rarely
many
thanks
to
beenitty
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
this
dude
always
hooks
me
up
with
amazing
beer
popped
and
poured
into
my
boulevard
stemware
glass
pours
a
murky
orange
color
frothy
white
head
fills
the
glass
nice
retention
visible
small
bubble
creep
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
pinot
grapes
orange
peel
coriander
ginger
pineapple
tart
bretty
funk
this
is
a
really
complex
aroma
a
lot
going
on
taste
on
the
first
sip
as
it
hits
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
get
a
funky
blast
of
wet
hay
mingled
with
some
sour
orangetropical
fruit
flavors
this
is
a
very
fruity
and
funky
saison
the
wine
notes
from
the
pinot
are
present
as
well
there
is
a
cracked
pepper
note
as
well
in
there
this
is
a
great
saison
incredibly
unique
and
creative
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
the
brett
delivers
a
nice
funkiness
as
well
im
super
impressed
with
anchorage
brewery
the
last
thing
i
had
from
them
was
whiteout
wit
they
really
do
brett
beers
well
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
some
hints
of
red
to
it
and
a
massive
white
head
smells
quite
floral
likely
from
the
rose
hips
but
its
got
a
bit
of
a
hibiscus
character
to
it
too
the
wine
comes
through
and
gives
a
bit
of
sweet
grape
must
aroma
mild
spice
notes
are
also
present
the
flavor
is
highly
floral
and
grapey
a
bit
sweeter
than
imagined
but
a
touch
of
lemon
peel
type
tartness
there
is
some
oak
to
it
and
a
bit
of
spice
flavor
as
well
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
d
one
of
the
best
new
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
really
diggin
this
d
very
impressed
with
both
anchorage
beers
i
have
had
very
complex
with
just
the
right
amount
of
brett
a
sip
is
smooth
and
dry
with
flavors
more
subdued
than
the
nose
still
nice
spice
and
delicate
tartness
citrus
and
subtle
funk
good
carbonation
crisp
with
a
smooth
medium
to
lighter
body
a
bit
of
the
winelike
alcohol
presents
itself
at
the
finish
really
a
nice
sipping
saison
the
nose
is
brilliant
o
first
i
had
bitter
monk
and
i
thought
i
had
died
and
gone
to
heaven
then
i
had
whiteout
wit
and
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
ever
had
going
into
this
beer
i
thought
there
is
no
way
that
a
brewery
could
go
three
for
three
id
like
to
say
that
i
was
surprised
but
deep
down
i
had
a
feeling
this
beer
would
also
be
amazing
buy
stock
in
this
brewery
its
my
new
favorite
enjoyable
i
like
this
one
a
lot
a
little
hoppier
than
i
expected
light
feel
with
good
carbonation
really
nice
offering
here
glad
to
try
this
this
is
impressive
a
bit
less
in
boldness
and
taste
than
the
bitter
monk
but
i
found
this
to
be
the
more
drinkable
one
out
of
the
two
a
whole
bottle
was
childs
play
now
i
just
need
somebody
to
get
a
taste
of
the
new
wit
cause
i
aint
buying
that
one
o
a
great
barrel
aged
saison
a
little
pricey
but
worth
a
try
im
really
impressed
with
this
offering
saisons
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
brings
a
lot
to
the
plate
the
barrel
aging
adds
huge
layers
of
complexity
and
dry
hopping
with
citra
goes
a
long
way
this
is
a
win
this
is
another
nice
beer
from
anchorage
but
again
these
philadelphia
prices
just
arent
worth
it
thats
not
to
say
its
not
a
tasty
beer
because
it
is
but
theres
definitely
more
walletfriendly
options
out
there
if
you
want
a
funky
saison
if
i
could
find
this
a
few
bucks
less
each
time
this
would
be
one
to
cellar
and
revisit
later
for
me
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
color
with
just
a
hint
of
amber
scent
is
initially
citrus
fruit
orange
and
grapefruit
with
some
pinot
noir
aromas
more
of
a
wine
scent
than
a
beer
very
nice
french
oak
aromas
with
some
hoppiness
and
spicy
aromas
just
a
bit
of
brett
taste
is
initially
spicy
with
pepper
and
lemon
zest
lovely
french
oak
flavors
with
very
noticeable
brett
and
barnyard
flavors
the
pinot
noir
is
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
quite
a
hoppy
saison
also
finish
spicy
bitter
and
a
little
tart
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
dry
drinkability
is
very
high
and
the
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
overall
this
is
one
fantastic
saison
i
absolutely
love
it
need
to
get
more
to
age
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
this
is
a
very
nice
saison
damn
this
works
so
well
on
so
many
levels
between
just
this
and
bitter
monk
im
thinking
anchorage
should
win
the
award
for
best
new
brewer
of
2011
no
idea
when
they
actually
started
up
but
theyve
really
got
something
to
be
proud
of
with
their
tiny
handful
of
offerings
hopefully
theyll
move
into
the
stoutporter
realm
would
love
to
see
what
they
can
do
on
that
side
of
the
tracks
yep
this
is
a
good
barrel
aged
saison
i
love
what
the
brett
and
wine
barrels
add
highly
recommended
o
i
think
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
good
as
boulevards
saisionbrett
but
its
still
fantastic
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
buying
a
few
more
bottles
over
the
next
couple
of
months
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
that
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
some
brett
funk
a
lot
of
grape
and
red
wine
black
pepper
and
some
apple
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
apple
and
apricot
then
some
red
wine
and
barrel
comes
through
with
a
peppery
note
some
brett
and
some
yeastiness
the
finish
is
moderately
dry
medium
body
mediumhigh
carbonation
an
enjoyable
saison
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
be
slightly
drier
overall
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
height
of
their
bitter
monk
but
still
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
but
even
independent
of
price
ive
had
better
ones
factor
in
price
and
this
drops
a
notch
lower
in
desirability
i
was
much
more
impressed
by
bitter
monk
the
judgment
very
pleasant
with
a
balance
between
hops
sour
and
saison
the
strong
hops
flavor
is
interesting
in
this
saison
and
maybe
if
they
were
not
as
harsh
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
overall
not
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
the
yeast
dominates
everything
and
it
is
otherwise
very
one
dimensional
d
a
really
nice
saison
but
with
less
depth
than
bitter
monk
still
its
ultimately
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
id
gladly
drink
again
if
it
were
a
bit
more
affordable
these
anchorage
beers
have
really
developed
a
house
quality
a
la
jolly
pumpkin
even
though
i
think
gabe
is
merely
using
a
commercially
available
brett
strain
o
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
an
absolute
brett
bomb
but
the
beer
behind
it
stands
up
fairly
well
not
sour
really
at
all
just
metallic
from
the
brett
i
wanted
to
like
the
taste
of
this
a
lot
more
than
i
did
to
be
honest
but
the
gorgeous
scent
alone
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
take
on
a
saison
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
anchorage
brewing
company
that
is
brewed
with
brett
and
aged
in
french
oak
wine
barrels
and
theyve
both
been
phenomenal
these
are
very
fresh
interesting
flavors
and
i
really
appreciate
them
kudos
anchorage
o
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
really
nice
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
a
really
good
representation
of
the
style
i
recommend
trying
this
one
out
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
brett
bomb
with
a
good
saison
behind
it
good
spices
fruity
somewhat
sweet
in
the
finish
only
a
little
yeasty
very
generous
head
of
foam
very
drinkable
above
average
mouthfeel
a
little
funky
aroma
bottle
from
bierkraft

cork
popped
into
the
other
side
of
a
large
room

carbonation
poured
a

offwhite
head
with
a
lasting
merengue
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
colored
body
smells
a
little
like
pickle
juice
at
first
but
there
some
malt
too
taste
happily
was
only
a
touch
sour
and
has
more
malt
than
the
smell
hinted
as
well
as
raisin
from
the
grape
brewing
and
some
mild
but
quality
hops
finish
is
pretty
long
and
yes
bretty
notes
again
a
bit
pricey
but
for
what
it
is
but
for
what
it
does
this
feels
worth
it
nice
quality
and
complexity
glad
to
see
these
brews
around
3
54444
but
i
should
probably
mark
down
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
not
a
real
saison
by
any
stretch
okay
for
american
but
still
just
a
nice
play
from
an
emerging
brewery
o
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
while
its
not
like
a
fantome
the
sour
elements
play
with
the
malts
just
right
awesome
overall
impression
you
could
definitely
hint
at
the
pinot
noir
barrels
that
were
used
in
this
process
but
only
in
the
nose
had
a
ton
of
hop
character
for
a
saison
would
love
to
enjoy
this
one
again
very
interesting
bitter
monk
is
still
my
favorite
anchorage
brewing
beer
but
so
far
they
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
buy
this
seek
it
out
even
this
is
the
real
deal
cheers
o
overall
a
really
nice
saison
from
anchorage
i
really
liked
it
some
nice
funk
and
brett
especially
in
the
nose
and
floral
hops
in
the
taste
would
like
to
have
it
again
pretty
decent
overall
medium
bodied
but
on
the
fuller
end
with
a
slight
creamy
texture
that
is
countered
by
the
funkysour
character
lots
of
musty
funkdry
brett
flavor
that
melds
with
the
saisonfarmhouse
yeast
pretty
well
slightly
puckering
but
more
dry
and
funky
than
tart
much
more
so
than
i
expected
resulting
in
a
dryness
that
is
exaggerated
by
the
berrel
notes
dry
toasted
oak
with
a
faint
vinous
red
wine
character
that
gives
off
hints
of
grape
strawberry
and
other
dark
fruits
pretty
complex
but
the
funkbrett
donates
slightly
overpowering
the
eatery
fruit
notes
and
pinot
noir
elements
pretty
good
with
a
well
masked
abv
but
could
use
bit
more
balance
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
am
looking
forward
to
sampling
more
from
this
brewery
o
i
think
this
is
a
really
fantastic
beer
to
be
putting
out
as
a
batch
1
line
from
a
new
brewery
i
understand
that
gabe
has
been
at
it
for
a
while
formerly
midnight
sun
however
i
think
this
will
be
a
beer
people
will
be
looking
for
in
a
few
years
id
grab
some
batch
1
of
this
bad
boy
and
revisit
it
at
some
tastings
i
most
certainly
will
grab
a
couple
bottles
i
think
this
one
will
blossom
with
an
elegant
floral
sweetness
like
ive
never
had
in
a
beer
this
is
like
saison
brett
with
plumshibiscus
really
very
good
o
a
nice
brew
interesting
because
it
is
sweetened
up
in
the
beginning
and
not
extreme
on
the
spices
but
overall
nice
still
think
henepin
beats
this
one
out
overall
its
an
expensive
ass
beersome
18
99
for
the
big
corkedcaged
750
its
cool
and
im
grateful
it
made
it
here
from
alaskapicked
it
up
from
tylers
in
carboroand
i
think
id
try
it
again
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
jd
this
is
a
really
interesting
and
unique
beer
for
sure
glad
to
try
it
after
really
enjoying
their
belgian
ipa
cant
say
that
i
loved
this
one
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
there
should
be
no
doubt
it
is
a
quality
beer
and
about
as
complex
as
it
gets
but
some
of
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
work
to
me
worth
the
15
or
so
dollars
though
as
there
is
a
lot
to
enjoy
in
here
notes
well
just
like
the
bitter
monk
this
beer
just
tastes
like
brett
sure
its
not
as
bitter
not
as
citrusy
as
bitter
monk
but
it
just
tastes
like
brett
the
beer
is
gone
the
label
sounds
like
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
see
much
of
it
in
the
beer
pours
a
glowing
hazy
pinkorange
with
a
just
offwhite
head
that
holds
and
leaves
pretty
lace
nose
is
citrusy
hops
flowers
strawberries
grape
must
lemon
lemon
pepper
and
earth
not
getting
much
wood
but
like
all
of
anchorages
other
beers
so
far
everything
is
seeming
very
well
integrated
taste
is
a
mellow
balanced
harmonic
expression
of
all
of
the
above
big
and
bold
while
remaining
smooth
and
subtle
the
rose
hippepper
spicing
never
gets
bitter
or
weird
and
the
yeasts
character
matches
well
with
everything
else
that
is
going
on
very
well
integrated
medium
body
fairly
dry
and
quite
round
from
all
the
fruitiness
just
a
touch
of
bretty
funk
in
the
middle
and
finish
another
fantastic
beer
from
anchorage
very
pleased
with
this
i
dont
have
access
to
boulevard
but
im
going
to
enjoy
having
easy
access
to
this
overall
nice
stuff
very
enjoyable
and
the
price
can
be
stomached
if
the
burden
is
shared
o
this
beer
is
great
ive
been
impressed
with
the
2
brews
ive
had
from
anchorage
so
far
very
good
body
and
nice
individual
flavors
that
work
well
together
o
another
good
showing
from
anchorage
o
another
great
offering
form
anchorage
brewing
a
bit
outside
the
box
but
very
well
done
a
very
flavorful
saison
with
good
complexity
goat
cheese
and
saison
combine
in
the
flavor
noticeable
bitterness
from
the
hops
lemony
cheesy
bitter
finish
caramel
backbone
and
slightly
vinous
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
im
looking
forward
to
many
more
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
at
the
down
south
beer
tasting
while
aasher
was
in
town
to
visit
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
orange
spices
dark
fruit
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
orange
grape
dark
fruit
and
wood
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
am
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
the
saison
style
in
general
but
the
addition
of
dark
fruit
in
this
one
really
won
my
heart
the
component
definitely
added
to
the
depth
of
the
brew
and
blended
quite
well
with
the
spices
typically
found
in
the
style
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
opportunity
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
the
smell
and
taste
captivates
your
nostrils
and
taste
buds
o
dont
drink
this
too
cold
to
be
honest
i
was
pretty
meh
about
it
when
it
just
same
out
of
the
refrigerator
however
at
nearly
room
temperature
it
develops
a
little
more
body
and
sweetness
that
balances
it
out
a
solid
saison
a
little
too
rosy
on
the
nose
as
it
warms
but
the
flavor
profile
is
varied
interesting
and
decently
integrated
beer
is
light
in
body
and
effervescent
on
the
palate
the
overall
beer
is
dry
on
the
finish
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
nice
spice
profile
and
great
yeast
profile
the
funk
dominated
the
front
half
of
the
palate
id
have
this
beer
again
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
nose
brings
forward
loads
of
fruity
brettinduced
funk
a
bit
of
a
tropical
character
is
present
plus
some
light
red
wine
the
brett
takes
the
show
faint
tropical
citra
notes
there
as
well
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
integrated
and
is
almostcompletely
dominated
by
the
brett
while
the
brett
character
is
quite
nice
its
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
i
would
have
liked
to
get
a
bit
more
spice
as
it
warms
further
some
of
the
wine
comes
out
but
still
none
of
the
other
additions
lightmedium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
brett
heavy
good
but
not
fantastic
o
not
quite
a
classic
saison
but
definitely
well
made
and
flavorful
overall
this
is
just
flat
out
fantastic
a
home
run
i
cant
say
anymore
the
bottle
was
gone
in
less
than
ten
minutes
i
love
it
yet
another
top
notch
beer
from
the
folks
at
anchorage
brewing
o
once
again
a
very
successful
beer
from
anchorage
brewing
i
cant
say
its
the
best
beer
of
its
style
with
so
many
other
worthy
saisons
out
there
but
its
damned
good
beautifully
balanced
and
deeply
flavored
this
beer
is
among
the
best
drink
it
fresh
if
possible
better
than
most
fantome
beers
very
interesting
beer
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
could
see
fantome
making
which
is
high
praise
in
my
book
o
this
is
a
really
good
saison
i
am
impressed
with
my
first
brew
from
anchorage
o
saison
as
it
should
be
sweet
and
sour
acidic
tangy
fruity
you
can
pile
on
the
adjectives
pineapple
and
herbal
tea
beautiful
longlasting
head
on
a
cloudy
golden
brew
quite
aromatic
and
spicy
in
the
nose
gets
more
bitter
as
you
sip
this
bottle
was
sampled
during
the
south
carolina
tasting
it
pours
a
nice
cloudy
dull
orange
in
color
with
a
very
soapy
head
that
turned
into
a
white
lacing
around
my
glass
it
smells
of
fresh
mangos
and
tangerines
with
little
spice
or
wine
influence
but
it
smells
spectacular
it
instantly
reminded
me
of
guava
grove
the
flavors
are
somewhat
chalky
and
very
dry
i
get
some
rose
or
hibiscus
as
well
the
brett
makes
itself
known
it
drinks
light
grainy
and
dry
overall
its
a
solid
saison
and
pretty
good
overall
its
a
nice
beer
to
share
but
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
one
by
myself
o
anchorage
brewing
how
i
love
thee
winners
popping
up
every
time
so
far
i
prefer
to
think
of
this
as
bitter
monk
lite
its
not
really
a
saison
by
the
everyday
definition
but
neither
is
the
monk
a
dipa
by
the
usual
definition
a
very
good
beer
but
id
take
bitter
monk
instead

time

this

breweries
and
one
of
the
top
5
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
year
overall
is
really
good
beer
i
will
fro
sure
be
trying
again
soon
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
saisons
but
this
one
was
fantastic
just
the
right
balance
of
sour
i
didnt
detect
any
oak
nice
tartness
and
brett
funkiness
in
aroma
flavor
is
full
of
citric
acid
and
a
touch
of
brett
funkiness
lemon
sourness
and
grapefruit
tartness
complement
a
modest
toasted
malt
body
and
light
sweetness
pricepoint
is
high
but
damn
good
beer
lots
of
funk
and
sour
going
on
didnt
detect
the
oak
first
cs
sourness
overpowers
all
funky
tastes
in
this
bottle
another
outstanding
belgian
inspired
creation
from
the
masters
at
crooked
stave
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
by
one
of
their
brews
one
of
my
four
or
five
favorite
breweries
in
the
us
and
probably
the
only
one
that
can
compete
with
the
belgian
giants
i
am
so
glad
i
went
back
and
had
this
sour
beer
makes
me
think
about
how
great
they
can
be
o
very
good
saison
that
has
all
of
the
farmhouse
funk
that
i
love
a
lovely
example
of
a
soured
up
take
on
the
style
so
happy
to
get
to
try
these
guys
again
overall
this
is
my
first
sour
beer
and
i
really
did
not
expect
it
to
be
as
sour
as
it
is
an
interesting
style
not
sure
its
my
thing
o
a
delicious
saison
clean
and
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
earth
shattering
just
the
right
amount
of
funk
and
tartness
overall
i
would
most
certainly
get
this
again
foggy
golden
yellow
topped
by
a
small
beautifully
creamy
white
head
deeply
funky
somewhat
acetic
aromas
featuring
musty
earth
barnyard
damp
hay
oak
and
grape
flavor
is
equally
funky
but
with
a
larger
tart
lemon
note
through
the
middle
grapes
and
grapefruit
some
wheaty
grain
and
grassy
freshness
but
mostly
bright
citrus
acidity
and
funk
mediumlight
with
some
pretty
serious
pucker
leaving
the
gum
line
dry
very
nice
not
exactly
something
i
would
consider
within
the
realm
of
saison
but
good
nevertheless
bright
citrusy
and
very
tart
saison
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
tried
picked
up
a
bunch
of
crooked
stave
when
my
liquor
store
began
stocking
it
and
despite
the
steep
price
tag
have
to
say
im
glad
i
did
overall
well
im
leaving
what
i
said
above
to
say
it
all
and
a
little
dazed
and
confused
reference
alright
aalright
aaaalllright
taste
yeah
well
okay
just
go
out
and
buy
all
of
these
that
you
can
find
then
mail
them
to
me
k
thanks

barrel
notes
although
overshadowed
are
there
to
balance
out
the
onslaught
of
epic
flavor
borderline
divine
beer
so
good
so
worth
the
price
so
worth
the
drive
im
going
to
take
on
wednesday
to
get
as
many
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
actually
everyone
please
dont
buy
any
and
leave
them
all
for
me
end
of
review
overall
a
nice
sourish
saison
great
balanace
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
brettanomyces
lacto
pale
malts
tastes
nice
and
sourtart
for
a
saison
but
in
an
awesome
way
great
flavor
from
start
to
finish
pleasant
sourness
throughout
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
slightly
prickly
as
saisons
tend
to
be
with
a
smooth
finish
awesome
experience
overall
with
this
brew
would
definitely
seek
out
again
overall
balanced
quaffable
tart
sour
ale
might
have
again
definitely
worth
a
shot
as
is
most
stuff
by
them
if
you
ever
see
it
4
fantastic
and
surprising
tart
saison
much
closer
to
a
sour
than
most
saisons
but
still
very
easy
to
drink
great
sour
apple
flavor
along
with
an
acidic
vinegar
note
on
the
nose
despite
being
aged
in
oak
barrels
wood
notes
are
muted
very
tart
in
a
pleasing
way
dont
pass
this
up
if
you
havent
experimented
with
sour
beers
i
love
what
crooked
stave
can
do
with
a
saison
so
refreshing
to
see
this
take
on
it
wow
great
sour
well
done
excellent
beer
fantastic
really
o
tons
of
sour
and
tart
taste
right
in
your
face
to
me
this
one
has
some
power
and
kick
behind
it
this
beer
is
enjoyable
thirst
quenching
and
delicious
o
an
excellent
saison
delivering
a
complex
flavor
profile
with
a
strong
sour
bite
that
seems
less
reliant
on
hops
and
more
on
yeast
will
repeat
ofirst
time
trying
crooked
stave
overall
a
great
saison
love
the
oak
will
get
some
more
o
never
have
i
encountered
a
beer
with
such
a
cleandirty
duality
in
the
flavor
the
brett
presence
is
moderate
but
impactful
as
it
complements
all
the
other
elements
present
not
the
best
brett
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
certainly
in
the
top
ten
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
by
crooked
stave
and
i
cant
wait
to
seek
out
more
of
them
just
a
nondescript
acidic
and
sour
note
with
no
definition
of
my
recent
crooked
stave
get
i
looked
forward
to
this
the
most
but
ended
up
the
most
disappointed
i
have
another
bottle
so
i
will
be
giving
it
another
try
but
this
left
me
flat

mouthfeel
a

thin
my
bottle
had
very
slight
carbonation
which
i
see
differs
a
bit
from
other
reviews
the
flatness
of
the
pour
may
have
effected
the
taste
profile
and
my
review
i
will
try
to
weak
out
another
bottle
for
comparison
someday
very
fine
soft
carbonation
medium
low
with
medium
body
o
very
enjoyable
and
a
nice
example
of
a
saison
with
brett
that
is
barrel
aged
tart
without
being
overly
sour
very
approachable
nice
amounts
of
complexity
overall
i
recommend
it
and
i
would
drink
it
again
its
a
great
tasting
saison
that
isnt
over
the
top
sour
and
isnt
so
mellow
that
it
bores
you
to
death
its
right
there
in
the
middle
where
it
should
be
overall
one
of
my
favorite

poured
a

with

of
fluffy

lots
of
staying
power
on
the
head
that
left
some
pretty
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
was
kinda
tart
and
lemony
with
a
bit
of
that
barnyard
funk
and
some
slight
sour
apple
the
taste
is
pretty
sour
up
front
but
then
i
get
some
grassy
wheat
type
flavors
the
finish
is
where
this
one
really
stands
out
with
such
a
nice
woody
clean
aftertaste
mmmmm
nice
and
dry
with
just
the
right
carbonation
to
compliment
the
tartness
overall
this
beer
really
stands
out
glad
i
live
in
colorado
and
can
find
this
all
the
time
overall
really
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
values
out
there
for
what
it
is
id
definitely
get
this
again
3

d
its
good
but
not
great
overall
i
really
like
the
oak
characteristics
in
this
brew
sour
notes
are
rounded
yet
kept
in
check
tasty
base
beer
allows
for
it
to
develop
well
in
the
barrel
i
actually
got
to
enjoy
this
on
tap
and
i
preferred
it
in
that
format
but
both
are
excellent
well
done
crooked
stave
beautiful
balance
of
flavors
he
its
not
overly
spiced
yeasty
or
dry
just
a
solid
drinkable
saison
wish
this
were
in
a
750
so
i
could
time
how
quickly
i
make
it
through
the
bottle
this
little
one
was
gone
within
minutes
this
may
be
an
excellent
sour
beer
but
its
not
a
saison
but
im
only
being
pissy
because
it
makes
my
teeth
hurt
from
the
375
ml
bottle
purchased
at
grapevine
liquors
batch
102014
if
youre
into
dry
tart
funkiness
this
is
something
you
might
want
to
seek
out
i
think
its
fine
for
what
it
is
but
its
charms
are
lost
on
me
o
wonderful
saison
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
on
the
nose
but
the
tastes
more
than
make
up
for
it
o
definitely
a
beer
i
will
drink
again
and
again
o
more
restrained
subtle
and
straightforward
than
some
of
crooked
staves
other
work
this
one
would
make
a
good
quaffing
beer
i
like
it
very
nice
summer
saison
funky
with
some
acidic
tartness
and
has
a
well
rounded
body
this
brewery
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
o
certainly
not
your
average
saison
very
tart
but
nicely
structured
elegant
in
a
belgian
farmhouse
sort
of
way
really
tasty
and
well
done
overall
we
are
always
happy
to
try
another
offering
from
crooked
stave
and
are
happy
they
finally
hit
national
distribution
this
is
a
bottle
of
2013batch
5
and
it
certainly
doesnt
disappoint
we
are
most
excited
about
its
funky
zing
right
when
you
take
that
first
sip
this
is
our
second
beer
of
the
day
and
it
still
punched
the
tongue
without
reserve
the
bitterness
and
tartness
of
flavor
comes
from
both
the
yeast
strains
used
and
the
extended
oak
barreling
acting
synergistically
together
comparing
this
guy
to
one
of
their
other
national
releases
vielle
it
is
much
much
stronger
and
muskier
as
expected
but
drinks
a
bit
slower
for
the
same
reasons
this
one
stays
with
you
lingering
for
a
long
time
on
the
tongue
palate
esophagus
and
stomach
but
there
is
a
certainly
clarity
to
it
that
you
just
dont
find
in
your
typical
sour
or
saison
overall
a
very
well
done
wild
saison
and
one
that
i
will
likely
pick
up
every
time
i
run
across
it
on
shelves
since
it
doesnt
sit
for
long
my
only
regret
is
that
the
price
is
a
little
hefty
for
12
7
oz
of
beer
but
its
nice
for
a
onceinawhile
treat
the
beer
is
cloudy
and
yellow
almost
moving
toward
a
brownorange
color
with
a
sticky
head
above
the
aroma
is
tart
unripe
apples
berries
and
a
sense
of
funk
tart
and
tangy
on
the
palate
this
is
a
true
pleasure
to
imbibe
the
light
bread
mixes
with
the
belgian
sourness
to
a
create
an
enjoyable
saison
of
the
saisons
brewed
in
the
u
s
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
great
job
just
one
of
the
best
sours
available
on
the
shelves
and
stands
up
with
world
class
brews
overall
great
earthy
brett
forward
saison
the
brett
really
plays
well
with
the
medium
bitterness
i
wish
i
had
this
as
an
everyday
drinker
this
is
great
stuff
doesnt
look
or
smell
like
an
impressive
beer
is
coming
but
the
palate
makes
up
for
it
easily
if
crooked
stave
made
a
sour
or
a
saison
and
named
it
dog
turds
i
would
still
want
to
try
it
these
beers
are
consistently
interesting

great
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
interesting
things
going
on
while
remaining
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
takes
some
of
my
favorite
elements
of
a
saison
and
matches
them
with
the
flavors
and
aromas
typical
of
a
dryhopped
sour
overal
i
enjoy
it
very
much
first
crooked
stave
bottle
poured
into

with

that
leaves

a

taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
starts
with
mildly
tart
lemon
juice
with
some
nice
oak
moving
through
notes
of
funk
and
a
smooth
bready
finish
with
very
subtle
notes
of
coriander
or
spice
and
lingering
citrus
seems
at
least
a
little
undercarbed
but
i
would
probably
guess
thats
the
age
at
play
nice

sour
tasting

faint
taste

very
well

wish
i
could
get
this
on
the
regular
overall
my
first
crooked
stave
two
things
come
to
mind
three
lions
was
more
than
honest
in
saying
phenomenal
and
two
where
has
this
beer
been
all
my
life
kudos
really
nice
interesting
and
super
tart
and
funky
saison
great
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
offering
slightly
hazy
straw
colored
beer
with
a
small
white
topping
that
fades
rather
quickly
to
a
finely
bubbled
ring
and
thin
patch
at
the
center
aroma
is
farmy
flowers
and
barnyard
hay
scents
plus
country
apples
acidic
and
sweet
woody
and
goseesque
with
a
touch
of
something
saltylike
taste
is
tart
and
dry
with
light
acidity
apple
white
wine
maybe
wood
musk
and
flowers
a
bit
mouthwatering
with
each
sip
texture
is
clean
and
fluid
overall
very
refreshing
and
pleasant
i
could
go
for
some
more
mostly
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
forming
on
the
surface
aroma
is
quite
funky
barnyard
brett
flowers
lemonlime
and
musty
oak
nicely
flavorful
and
bretty
without
being
aggressive
with
the
yeast
tart
white
wine
fruitiness
flowers
grass
lemon
and
woody
spice
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
saline
quality
too
that
adds
to
the
refreshment
light
slick
and
dry
finishing
a
little
watery
definitely
a
nice
experience
though
way
too
expensive
to
drink
as
much
as
id
like
in
love
with
this
beer
poured
a
little
cloudy
with
tons
of
fluffy
sticky
white
head
brett
and
pepper
on
the
nose
gloriously
dry
pretty
body
with
saison
character
and
some
oak
a
stellar
beer
i
wish
i
could
access
this
beer
more
readily
thought
it
was
rather
plain
overall
quite
enjoyable
my
first
corooked
stave
the
taste
is
very
lemonywith
pineapple
sour
and
slight
astringent
taste
with
bretty
funk
and
light
medicinal
aspect
mid
palate
with
grapefruit
in
the
taste
which
is
lightly
acidic
the
intensity
of
sourness
is
lingering
after
the
finish
this
is
interesting
and
drinkable
for
the
style
a
very
tasty
session
strength
saison
i
am
nit
picking
but
the
soapy
hop
character
is
just
a
slight
detractor
outside
of
that
an
excellent
tart
saison
and
one
i
wish
i
could
get
more
easily
overall
a
really
nice

poured

up
the

followed
by
an

all

subtle

and
lemon
grass
some
astringent
and
medicinal
notes
in
there
as
well
as
subtle

characteristics
the
body
is
effervesced
and
extremely
dry
giving
the
beer
a
dry
white

feel
in

the
aftertaste
has
a
sour
overtone
with
citrus
and
herbal
spices
lingering
shortly
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
and
the
carbonation
helps
to
clean
the
palate
quickly
interesting
brew
mouthfeel
left
a
pucker
as
it
was
like
sucking
on
a
lemon
and
then
licking
wet
cardboard
but
thats
to
be
expected
from
this
kind
of
beer
it
was
a
very
light
beer
almost
watery
with
mild
carbonation
and
considering
the
high
bitterness
and
sourness
it
went
down
easier
than
it
should
have
overall
it
was
good
and
id
try
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
tasted
a
little
watered
downweak
but
that
is
what
you
get
with
a

beer
it
was
still
tasty
o
while
this
is
only
the
third
crooked
stave
beer
ive
had
theyve
shown
themselves
to
be
more
than
capable
of
making
a
great
brew
this
one
is
well
made
and
flavorful
o
this
would
be
a
good
thirst
quenching
beer
for
a
hot
summers
day
lacks
a
bit
in
the
complexity
department
to
rate
higher
and
perhaps
justify
the
price
still
a
quality
sour
mouthfeel
very
dry
light

farmhouse
ale
with
multifaceted

lots

super
refreshing
and
a
pretty
good
value
for
a

a
fairly
solid
if
slightly
unexciting
funky

the
flavor
follows
with
that
strong
tart
lemon
juice
a
hint
of
funk
slight
breadiness
and
is
dry

375

the

pours
a

with
about
an

both
the

are
good
the
brew
smells
like
lemon
peel
earthiness
hay

taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
tropical

peppery

and
green

the
tartness
comes
out
more
as

a
good

i
liked
this
a
lot
overall
i
thought
it
was
good
this
was
the
first
crooked
stave
beer
ive
tried
and
hopefully
ill
try
more
soon
8
99
a
bottle
if
i
had
this
near
by
id
buy
it
all
the
time
tasty
tart
lots
of
barnyard
and
funk
yeast
is
crazy
reminds
me
of
brie
with
that
almost
footy
thing
going
on
especially
on
the
nose
but
also
pretty
evident
in
the
finish
which
is
long
speaking
of
cheeses
i
get
a
bit
of
bleu
cheese
here
too
along
with
hay
and
lambs
wool
meyer
lemon
or
maybe
preserved
lemon
in
the
back
theres
a
little
acetone
nail
polish
remover
faint
and
blended
in
very
well
into
everything
else
confusing
the
senses
and
confounding
some
of
the
other
flavor
notes
but
not
in
a
bad
way
like
that
one
cord
that
kind
of
both
disrupts
but
pulls
together
a
piece
of
music
the
oak
is
also
subtle
and
mixes
things
up
but
in
a
good
way
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
oak
very
interesting
brew
o
its
hard
to
think
of
another
beer
similar
to
this
one
on
the
nose
it
seems
like
many
funky
brett
beers
but
the
mouthfeel
and
moderate
tartness
make
this
one
entirely
unique
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
experience
all
around
this
is
too
much
like
a
belinerweiss
to
be
reviewed
adequately
as
a
saison
i
also
object
to
the
price
of
this
stuff
but
if
youre
into
trying
sours
this
is
very
approachable
from
the
375
ml
bottle
purchased
at
grapevine
liquors
batch
102014
m
mouthfeel
is
thin
rounded
out
by
prickly
tartness
and
finishes
very
dry
o
a
very
respectable
and
unique
saison
it
is
well
worth
trying
for
fans
of
the
style
o
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
saison
very
enjoyable
but
given
the
price
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
special
o
it
makes
me
think
of
a
gewurtztraminer
it
would
be
a
nice
picnic
beer
for
a
summer
day
its
certainly
not
bad
just
a
bit
light
and
flat
in
character
for
me
overall
a
decent
saison
but
i
cant
help
if
my
enjoyment
of
it
was
negatively
impacted
by
the
fact
that
i
enjoyed
surette
so
much
more
that
said
this
would
be
a
pretty
tasty
session
saison
or
as
they
were
once
known
saison
o
great
flavor
with
a
bellow

mouthfeel
for
the

with

earthiness
and
rounded

notes
light

lively

slick

a
wonderful
sessionable
saison
recommended
im
not
surprised
this
is
tasty
the
sour
notes
brett
funk
and
light
fruit
notes
are
quite
good
its
light
and
refreshing
and
its
more
of
an
entry
level
than
some
other
crooked
stave
offerings
so
easy
and
light
must
drink
all
summer
balanced
out
mix
of
saison
spicy
citrusy
yeast
and
bretty
straw
funk
an
easydrinking
saison
with
a
nice
tart
personality
o
a
nice
funky
saison
with
a
good
oak
presence
and
awesome
drinkability
a
bit
pricey
but
its
a
good
take
on
the
style
that
mixes
it
up
a
little
fantastic
beer
a
very
good
beer
not
one
of
the
best
from
cs
but
certainly
worth
trying
and
is
put
together
very
well
a
really
tasty
brew
with
lots
of

and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
tartness
present
tastes
of
citrus
yeast
hint
of
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt
sourness
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
floral
overall
good
appearance
aroma
blend
body
and
complexity
o
great
beer
for
a
spring
day
i
paired
it
with
some
grilled
chicken
with
a
jerk
rub
and
it
was
perfect
overall
i
could
drink
this
again
because
that
smell
is
just
so
fantastic
but
the
high
carb
makes
a
sipper
still
pretty
refreshing
though
light
golden
in
color
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
not
much
at
all
in
the
way
of
foam
brussels
lacing
oak
and
chardonnay
aroma
crisp
and
dry
on
the
palate
with
moderate
carbonation
i
get
oak
and
green
apples
with
a
slightly
tart
and
acidic
finish
this
is
a
very
refreshing
wild
ale
o
overall
a
good
saison
with
well
rounded
balanced
flavors
definitely
drink
this
beer
at
the
suggested
temperature
on
the
bottle
at
a
colder
temp
this
beer
had
an
unpleasant
tartness
at
the
right
temp
it
had
some
fieldlike
funkiness
with
the
esters
from
the
brett
shining
through
nice
representation
of
the
style
but
it
didnt
justify
the
price
point
in
my
opinion
barrel
aged
table
strength
saison
pours
a
cloudy

one

the

i
like
the

to

by
someone
else
still
cant
get
over
the
blatant
mislabeling
of
this
one
but
its
still
a
very
fine
beverage
real
easy
drinking
saison
and
full
of
flavor
real
nice
overall
pretty
nice
good
saison
bit
seems
to
be
missing
much
of
the
funk
atmosphere
is
really
nice
golden

fair

and
some
spotty
lacing
fragrant
fruit
and
bread
components
in
the
nose
lightly
bitter
sweet
and
tart
flavors
of
fermented
fruit
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
verdict
a
delicious
saison
from
crooked
stave
the
oak
aging
and
light
tartness
really
make
it
a
unique
and
engaging
take
on
the
style
it
was
crisp
easy
to
drink
and
brought
along
a
really
nice
balance
of
flavors
id
love
to
be
able
to
enjoy
this
regularly
this
is
everything
a
saison
should
be
just
ideal
and
amazingly
drinkable
as
most
of
the
standard
crooked
stave
beers
are
amazing
how
the
brett
andor
lacto
is
integrated
just
enough
to
be
a
nuance
to
the
beer
not
a
dominating
factor
resulting
in
a
beer
i
think
any
beer
drinker
would
enjoy
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
crisp
light
carbonation
and
some
tart
puckering
sourness
that
lingers
over
the
musty
bugs
dry
oak
earthy
funk
acidic
acid
and
sweeter
fruit
notes
into
a
dry
acetic
finish
decent
amount
of
tart
sourness
but
could
use
more
acidity
the
sourness
is
cut
by
some
lactic
cheesy
funk
and
dry
toasted
oak
wild
bugs
contribute
to
the
funk
but
theres
a
sweet
vinous
presence
that
compliments
the
bready
yeast
and
estery
light
fruit
notes
almost
has
a
white
wine
like
characteristic
midpalate
with
some
light
grape
and
stone
fruit
flavor
hints
of
grass
and
straw
complimenting
the
bugs
and
funky
yeast
before
hints
of
bread
apple
and
lemon
juice
come
through
in
the
finish
citric
acidity
becomes
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
but
it
could
be
a
little
stronger
for
my
preference
some
lingering
acetic
acid
on
the
back
end
but
its
not
harsh
or
solvent
like
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
kind
of
like
a
light
american
version
of
gueuze
blended
with
earthy
saison
notes
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
complex
flavors
another
solid
beer
from
the
folks
at
crooked
stave
odecent
saison
a
little
on
the
light
side
nice
appearance
with
a
big
rocky
head
of
light
foam
not
too
cloudy
either
aromas
of
lemon
zest
grapefruit
and
sweet
acidity
a
bit
of
funk
from
the
brett
balanced
with
a
smooth
contrasting
light
maltiness
and
citrus
hops
lively
carbonation
and
refreshing
lightly
tart
finish
pretty
sour
for
a
saison
but
tasty
for
those
who
like
sours
beautifully
complex
but
elegant
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
quite
well
done
od
nice
stuff
very
easy
drinking
and
good
and
complex
with
cool
sour
elements
o
an
extremely
refreshing
drinkable
and
traditional
complex
beer
this
is
even
more
alluring
since
it
has
more
character
at
4
2
abv
than
other
beers
nearly
double
its
abv
tag
at
9
99
for
a
375
ml
bottle
its
a
bit
high
but
it
is
worth
every
penny
for
this
liquid
art
a
great
saison
in
terms
of
allaround
appeal
a
loud
nose
with
misleading
sweetness
but
damn
fine
flavor
o
needs
more
carbonation
but
nice
aroma
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
enjoyable
a
fantastically
flavorful
refreshing
and
sessionable
saison
crooked
stave
really
know
how
to
harness
and
proportionately
distribute
the
often
overwhelming
flavors
of
the
wild
brettanomyces
yeast
strain
vieille
is
probably
the
best
modern
day
take
on
a
saison
done
traditionally
i
e
low
abv
and
fermented
and
aged
in
oak
barrels
recommended
a
lovely
amber
golden
cloud
decent
head
with
a
nice

in
the
nose
with
notes
of
pale
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
lots
of
oak
and
funk
feel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
drinkability
is
determined
by
you
love
of
sours
ales
as
this
one
has
saison
character
but
really
has
its
feet
in
the
sour
camp
nice
beer
cloudy
amber
pour
into
a
cs
tulip
thanks
again
to
corey
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
foamy
ringlet
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
lots
of
earthy
funk
in
the
nose
notes
of
wet
grass
and
waterlogged
oak
more
of
the
grassy
funk
in
the
taste
but
theres
an
accompanying
tartness
slightly
lemony
slightly
lactoish
complex
notes
of
oak
mineral
and
a
little
green
pepper
fresh
and
crisp
juicy
start
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
one
complex
saisonwild
alething
medium
body
moderate
carb
very
welldone
overall
o
a
beautiful
deceiving
nose
leads
one
to
think
theyre
getting
a
citrusy
hoppy
treat
but
the
taste
is
all
sour
quite
a
treat
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
the
mouthfeel
really
hurts
this
one
for
me
the
aroma
is
awesome
the
flavour
is
quite
nice
but
the
watery
mouth
such
a
shame
o
good
stuff
like
i
said
reminds
me
of
a
fântome
just
missing
some
of
the
funk
that
is
in
there
its
sweet
spicy
and
just
a
little
sour
really
refreshing
and
flavorful
o
a
beer
that
has
an
undeniable
club
soda
character
makes
for
an
interesting
drink
but
not
a
10
purchase
maybe
not
even
a
6
purchase
nevertheless
crooked
stave
has
shown
me
that
theyre
willing
to
mix
things
up
offering
one
of
the
most
unique
lowalcohol
beers
ive
ever
had
theres
excellent
craftsmanship
in
this
little
bottle
and
thats
not
something
that
can
be
overlooked
the
beer
further
recedes
as
the
textures
fall
from
fullon
champagne
to
light
and
watery
in
an
instant
though
this
fuels
its
highly
drinkable
character
its
earthen
and
complex
aromas
promise
me
a
sharp
and
acidic
afterpalate
that
just
doesnt
develop
its
fleeting
finish
is
watery
and
minerally
and
a
little
alkaseltzerlike
o
great
flavors
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
i
wish
it
was
just
a
tiny
bit
fuller
a
very
good
low
alcohol
beer
though
m
light
to
medium
body
dry
moderate
carbonation
t
we
havent
been
getting
crooked
stave
for
very
long
here
in
san
diego
but
holy
schnikes
am
i
glad
theyre
here
this
tastes
awesome
opens
with
brett
lemongrass
hay
and
some
oak
on
the
backend
theres
some
lemon
like
sourness
cucumber
salt
and
wet
grass
a
pretty
dry
finish
with
an
almost
dry
white
wine
like
sourness
that
sticks
to
the
palate
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
cs
lots
of
brett
in
the
nose
and
sour
white
wine
and
fruit
as
well
would
certainly
have
again
just
wish
their
beers
were
a
little
bit
cheaper
pretty
nice
saison
dry
and
slightly
tart
with
some
good
earthy
grain
and
woody
notes
overall
some
nice
things
going
on
but
the
flavour
just
isnt
working
for
me
overall
i
like
it
but
cant
say
much
more
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
nice
quite
as
crisp
as
i
like
in
a
farmhouse
ale
othe
lack
of
a
crisp
finish
and
missing
funk
were
the
only
draw
backs
a
good
beer
overall
pretty
good
especially
for
such
a
sessionable
abv
there
are
other
options
that
are
as
good
but
significantly
cheaper
at
least
cheaper
than
what
i
paid
fantastic
aromas
that
combine
saison
and
lambic
qualities
flavor
follows
with
a
leaning
toward
lambic
its
got
a
fantastic
biting
tartness
from
start
to
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
great
to
see
stuff
like
this
coming
out
of
american
breweries
i
just
wish
they
were
closer
to
home
for
me
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
here
we
were
giving
the
classic
saison
with
funk
mustiness
grassiness
crispness
and
juicy
tartness
while
it
was
somewhat
lacking
the
nose
the
oak
aging
took
this
experience
one
step
further
through
the
flavoring
and
in
aiding
with
dryness
and
astringency
along
the
feel
the
yeastinfectables
too
added
that
unique
crooked
stave
twist
to
the
thing
giving
a
tad
more
punch
to
the
funk
and
the
tartness
throughout
the
citric
components
were
also
heavily
apparent
affording
much
of
the
bitterness
in
the
final
mix
with
the
yeast
this
is
a
bright
sessionable
experienced
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
for
those
looking
into
it
newly
and
those
who
love
it
as
well
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
saison
it
has
all
the
elements
of
a
fantastic
beer
of
this
style
with
grainy
wheat
citrus
notes
lactic
yeast
and
lots
of
brett
however
with
all
of
these
aromas
and
flavors
being
present
it
lacks
the
complexity
that
the
great
saisons
have
nevertheless
it
is
tasty
and
very
drinkable
im
interested
to
see
what
the
other
crooked
stave
beers
that
i
have
are
like
thanks
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
and
the
others
jared
overall
tasting
side
by
side
with
surette
i
am
afraid
this
one
pales
in
comparison
though
it
has
a
dynamic
sourness
that
may
be
preferred
by
others
o
really
nice
saison
that
shows
that
crooked
stave
really
can
make
some
of
the
best
saisons
in
america
another
nice
brew
from
crooked
stave
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brett
beer
but
my
one
criticism
is
that
it
is
not
quite
what
i
expect
from
a
saison
the
typical
banana
clove
and
other
spicy
characteristics
are
completely
overpowered
by
the
sour
funk
otherwise
what
an
outstanding
summer
beer
this
is
another
excellent
offering
from
crooked
stave
taste
is
of
citrus
tartness
and
light
grainy
maltness
of
pilsner
and
wheat
wonderfully
balanced
and
easy
to
pair
with
many
food
super
drinkable
and
refreshing
its
everything
an
everyday
saison
should
be
i
would
consume
this
every
day
if
i
could
overall
i
hate
to
say
im
not
overly
impressed
given
lack
of
depth
and
slight
watery
taste
o
i
liked
this
beer
because
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
had
some
refreshing
qualities
while
the
funk
made
it
interesting
the
funkiness
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
becomes
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
crisp
straw
malt
with
a
dose
of
funky
barnyard
nicely
dry
and
fruity
quite
an
awesome
saison
the
way
i
imagine
a
saison
would
have
been
in
old
belgium
o
certainly
a
crisp
funky
and
sour
saison
not
really
my
style
unfortunately
its
not
bad
at
all
my
taste
buds
just
arent
feeling
this
one
today
o
overall
glad
that
i
have
a
bunch
more
of
these
coming
but
this
might
be
one
to
amass
a
ton
of
and
drink
constantly
this
summer
what
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
i
can
only
imagine
what
time
will
do
to
this
winner
drink
em
if
you
got
em
though
since
they
are
fantastic
right
now
good
tart
saison
i
like
to
see
a
little
more
flavor
from
the
yeast
but
this
is
nice
overall
the
beer
is
okay
there
are
hints
of
acidity
a
lot
of
funk
but
the
beer
is
nothing
special
it
is
not
very
crisp
or
refreashing
and
gets
too
funky
as
it
warms
the
beer
is
golden
with
a
soft
white
head
the
aroma
offers
grain
floral
hops
light
spice
citrus
grass
light
candied
oranges
in
the
flavor
mild
sweetness
countered
by
a
touch
of
funk
light
in
body
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
quite
enjoyable
o
its
good
but
in
a
plain
way
if
that
makes
any
sense
definitely
not
worth
the
price
tag
in
nyc
13
for
a
12
7
ounce
bottle
but
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
more
reasonable
price
its
definitely
a
nice
sittingoutside
kind
of
beer
this
second
incarnation
of
the
vielle
saison
from
crooked
stave
lacks
the
punchy
complexity
of
its
forbearer
and
really
seems
like
a
dumbed
down
version
although
it
is
still
outstanding
by
most
peoples
standards
of
a
saison
and
in
fact
if
the
first
one
had
never
come
out
i
would
probably
be
raving
about
this
it
pours
the
same
hazy
pale
hay
color
as
the
first
one
with
some
suspended
yeast
and
a
big
airy
white
head
the
nose
is
a
lot
less
funky
just
a
touch
of
farmhouse
really
in
this
one
and
more
of
a
cultured
french
saison
yeast
profile
with
touches
of
straw
and
cut
grass
the
flavor
is
identical
to
the
nose
but
with
the
bretty
funk
and
complexity
of
the
first
one
missing
entirely
here
not
unpleasant
at
all
but
just
not
as
lively
some
lemon
and
grassy
notes
in
the
finish
but
the
yeast
to
me
again
feels
dialed
back
good
carbonation
bright
and
drinkable
like
all
crooked
stave
beers
really
just
classic
feel
this
beers
best
feature
to
me
overall
a
lovely
saison
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
its
first
edition
that
really
blew
the
doors
off
the
genre
and
represents
one
of
the
best
ive
had
still
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
are
new
to
crooked
stave
as
the
first
one
aint
coming
back
as
far
as
i
know
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
brett
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
brett
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
nice
funky
saison
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
barrel
aging
but
the
brett
was
definitely
there
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
white
with
an
orange
hue
and
a
slight
white
head
aroma
is
kinda
mia
there
is
some
sweetness
from
the
fruity
hops
and
i
get
a
little
tart
brett
but
really
its
justs
messy
and
indiscriminate
flavor
is
the
same
way
tastes
a
bit
woody
some
sweeter
citrus
and
a
maybe
some
ripe
earthy
root
type
vegetables
a
hodgepodge
of
random
stuff
that
is
just
messy
and
fails
to
come
together
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
with
some
slight
activity
overall
this
beer
is
straight
up
no
good
imo
i
loved
the
initial
batchvariation
and
was
disappointed
when
i
heard
it
was
not
going
to
be
continually
offered
that
said
i
was
excited
when
i
heard
the
tweaks
being
done
to
this
variation
unfortunately
what
sounded
good
on
paper
did
not
come
out
to
be
anything
close
to
being
good
in
real
life
i
gave
this
a
few
tries
before
i
reviewed
this
one
just
to
make
sure
it
was
a
consistent
problem
and
not
simply
one
bad
bottle
but
so
far
all
attempts
have
fared
the
same
of
all
the
crooked
stave
beers
to
buy
a
handful
of
right
out
of
the
gate
i
wish
it
hadnt
beenthis
one
if
these
beers
were
cheaper
i
honestly
would
have
drain
poured
some
of
this
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
brought
home
three
bottle
in
my
suitcase
clean
crisp
and
really
drinkable
try
some
youll
like
it
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
decent
with
a
thin
filmlike
retention
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
plenty
of
fresh
oak
aromas
and
tart
lemon
on
the
nose
its
also
pretty
funky
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
decent
but
a
little
one
dimensional
in
my
opinion
there
isnt
much
depth
to
this
its
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
though
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
has
a
decent
carbonation
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
in
the
future
this
is
apparently
a
different
malt
bill
than
the
previous
saison
vielle
artisanal
and
dry
hopped
with
citra
hops
the
label
is
different
and
i
was
confused
at
first
as
to
whether
it
was
really
a
new
beer
but
im
adding
it
golden
hazy
orange
color
soapy
head
i
dont
like
the
smell
at
all
onion
and
burned
rubber
not
good
at
all
flavor
was
ok
grains
yeast
meh
darn
i
was
hoping
the
citra
dry
hopping
would
make
this
something
special
like
tank
7
or
something
but
i
was
bored
i
also
did
not
pick
up
on
the
barrelfoeder
aspect
at
all
very
good
brett
saison
appearance
is
a
mammoth
offwhite
extremely
frothy
head
that
settles
slowly
loads
of
lace
and
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
aroma
is
yeast
malt
pears
plums
spice
flavors
similar
to
nose
slightly
sweet
at
first
then
a
bit
of
carbonic
tang
followed
by
rest
of
characteristics
and
finishing
again
with
a
bit
of
bittersweet
body
is
very
good
for
this
style
and
is
the
soft
side
overall
quite
a
drinkable
beer
the
taste
begins
with
a
general
fruity
complexity
that
leans
towards
pears
midway
the
yeasty
phenolics
and
black
pepper
round
out
the
flavor
nice
crisp
and
dry
finish
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
id
like
to
age
a
few
bottles
to
see
how
the
brettanomyces
continues
to
develop
i
feel
the
additional
aging
would
help
create
more
depth
and
complexity
nonetheless
very
enjoyable
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
in
that
order
i
would
drink
this
again
but
not
more
than
a
single
bottle
on
any
occaision
its
just
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
like
to
session
damn
glad
it
finally
showed
up
around
here
though
not
much
brett
but
a
dry
crisp
finish
with
some
wheat
and
spice
flavors
lemon
as
well
this
was
a
fantastic
brew
to
enjoy
after
a
62
mile
bicycle
ride
on
my
birthday
in
2014
hats
off
to
my
buddy
jeff
for
sharing
with
me
great
friends
great
times
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
did
not
expect
to
the
initial
aroma
was
that
of
a
sour
but
the
taste
was
anything
but
the
flavors
were
of
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
no
unpleasant
sourness
to
be
discerned
which
was
in
direct
contrast
with
the
nose
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
with
no
indication
of
its
8
abv
made
this
go
down
quick
and
easy
its
a
delicious
and
very
interesting
and
complex
brew
but
such
an
easy
and
pleasant
drink
that
i
was
extremely
pleased
with
giving
the
style
a
shot
will
have
again
d
seemed
to
get
better
with
each
sip
might
have
drank
this
too
fast
fruity
but
extremely
enjoyable
great
on
palate
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
not
my
usual
cupotea
but
worth
a
try
super
organic
lloking
head
mild
but
resounding
funk
on
the
nose
tart
is
the
first
impression
on
the
taste
buds
lacing
is
impressive
a
bit
of
lemoncitrus
starts
to
peek
through
a
lingering
in
the
palate
is
both
unctous
dry
not
at
all
unpleasant
not
a
very
resounding
compliment
but
i
can
recommend
this
as
change
of
pace
a
great
use
of
brett
in
this
beer
somewhere
between
a
fruit
and
funk
bomb
from
the
wild
yeast
but
the
flavor
and
body
are
spot
on
the
dryness
is
incredible
and
the
brett
leaves
a
chalky
feeling
thats
almost
tart
yet
has
champagne
similarities
that
keeps
it
light
flavorful
and
going
down
way
too
easy
for
this
abv
the
aftertaste
is
grainy
sweet
and
gives
tart
white
grape
flavors
that
resemble
the
bitter
white
wine
grape
right
before
fermentation
very
tasty
beer
really
enjoyable
but
a
little
less
flavorful
than
i
expected
o
this
is
just
about
everything
i
look
for
in
a
brett
saison
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
example
big
brett
aroma
like
ive
popped
open
a
notsofresh
in
the
best
way
orval
but
the
body
is
lighter
and
drier
as
a
saison
should
be
in
fact
among
dry
belgians
this
feels
especially
light
for
an
8
beer
the
big
barnyard
funk
aroma
dominates
and
rolls
through
the
flavor
with
a
mix
of
citrus
rind
and
spicy
floral
notes
theres
a
mild
bitterness
on
par
with
saison
dupont
and
the
hops
blend
nicely
in
the
bret
hell
of
a
beer
but
i
would
like
a
touch
more
body
to
carry
the
flavor
just
a
little
more
malt
maybe
but
its
still
an
excellent
saison
hazy
golden
body
with
a
creamy
white
head
and
great
lacing
herbal
fruit
banana
and
yeast
aromas
and
flavors
sour
brettanomyces
finish
this
was
most
excellent
if
it
was
slightly
less
carbonated
it
would
be
better
tasty
refreshing
good
plenty
of
flavor
to
boot
excellent
overall
a
nice
and
complex
farmhouse
ale
the
flavor
are
huge
and
bold
and
dominates
the
palate
a
definite
brett
bomb
for
when
you
are
craving
it
usually
i
like
my
saisons
lighter
and
more
quenching
but
i
wont
knock
this
ale
for
bringing
the
flavor
smooth
complex
flavorful
paired
with
some
mild
blue
cheese
and
celery
this
was
truly
a
delight
the
brett
developed
beautifully
big
orange
rind
some
tartness
and
that
big
dry
brett
character
almost
picked
up
some
sweetness
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
then
having
it
fresh
overall
my
scores
reflect
my
disappointment
with
losing
half
the
beer
and
if
it
didnt
gush
i
would
likely
have
rated
it
5
higher
my
expectations
were
very
high
having
just
enjoyed
the
seizoen
the
previous
night
even
so
i
would
still
have
likely
rated
the
seizoen
higher
pours
with
a
good
thick
head
that
dissipated
nearly
as
fast
as
it
came
glad
the
bottle
recommended
leaving
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
cause
there
was
a
crapload
smells
of
sweet
strawberries
and
tart
raspberries
starts
off
sweet
and
malty
and
slightly
malty
taste
then
drifts
fruity
with
strawberry
blueberry
and
blackberryboth
sweet
and
tart
mild
yeastiness
finishes
in
with
the
tart
fruit
and
also
some
lemon
along
with
a
mouthwatering
saltiness
almost
gose
like
flavors
here
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
i
even
tasted
a
bit
of
pinot
noir
at
the
end
definitely
a
tiny
bit
of
oaky
fruity
wine
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
the
8
0
i
really
like
the
fruitiness
at
the
end
very
nice
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
seek
it
out
again
when
i
am
within
range
of
their
distribution
well
crafted
saison
that
has
a
bright
fruit
character
and
mild
acidity
the
brett
is
really
a
non
player
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
a
let
down
in
that
manner
quite
drinkable
and
well
crafted
but
unremarkable
without
some
age
on
it
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
has
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
not
much
and
wonderful
complexity
there
is
a
cloudiness
to
it
that
adds
to
its
mystique
also
the
fact
that
it
is
still
reasonably
hard
to
get
and
unavailable
on
the
east
coast
the
bottle
itself
conveys
a
certain
sort
of
oldworld
mustiness
bottle
poured
a
dirty
cloudy
dark
beige
color
ale
with
a
huge
dirty
head
with
good
retention
and
some
excellent
lacing
aroma
of
rustic
malt
with
light
funky
yeasty
notes
is
quite
sublime
taste
is
dominated
by
dry
rustic
notes
with
some
funky
yeast
notes
and
a
dry
floral
finish
dry
brett
notes
are
clearly
identifiable
but
are
not
overwhelming
and
keep
the
malt
base
flavours
intact
body
is
full
with
super
great
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
gusher
as
well
btw
and
no
apparent
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
beer
this
every
day
of
the
year
m
the
carbonation
is
perfect
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
lively
this
is
one
of
those
beers
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
this
is
how
brett
saisons
should
taste
happy
to
try
but
wont
rush
out
for
this
again

direction
starting
off
tart
with
a
building
sweetness
being
cutoff
by
a
nice
acidity
and
dry

definitely
more
of
a
tart
juicy
brett
character
with
this
saison
flower

white

as
the
smell
crisp

dry

helps
conceal
the
strength
one
of
the
more
interesting
saisons
ive
had
i
think
initially
large
creamy

of
tight
foam

over
golden
orange

in

really
fun
to
smell
berries

to

all

taste
closely

nose
imo
very
refreshing
clean
lemony

yeast
is
upfront
as
would
be
expected
and
the
grassy

from
the
nose
holds
on
the
finishaftertaste
not
tons
of
carbonation
but
the
correct
amount
finishes
dry
and
long
overall
i
love
this
beer
the
brett
doesnt
outshine
the
well
brewed
saison
base
flavor
starts
off
with
nice
notes
of
fruit
juice
notes
of
pear
and
apple
juice
nice
grainy
sweetness
that
is
enveloped
by
an
awesome
brett
funk
and
some
good
spice
slight
tartness
is
present
with
a
nice
fluffy
carbonated
body
mild
lemony
notes
mixed
with
bread
and
some
oak
as
well
solid
saison
the
perfect
mix
of
flavor
and
drinkability
for
the
big
beer
summer
club
of
which
i
am
an
honorary
member
o
4
75
i
really
love
this
saison
i
usually
like
the
style
and
dont
seek
them
out
too
often
but
this
one
is
really
special
the
flavors
flow
and
develop
beautifully
on
the
palate
and
each
sip
is
very
interesting
and
you
find
something
new
o
this
is
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
saisons
and
being
a
true
farmhouse
ale
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
by
this
beer
citrus
and
funk
with
a
smooth
crisp
finish
i
will
buy
this
again
o
a
really
tasty
fairly
uncharacteristic
saison
the
flavor
is
very
good
with
great
brett
which
is
tropical
and
fruity
bringing
a
juicy
and
earthy
flavor
with
light
spice
and
citrus
tanginess
almost
grapefruity
with
mild
zest
and
light
hint
of
pepper
in
the
very
dry
finish
with
a
mild
hop
and
alcohol
taste
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
was
wishing
i
could
have
gotten
more
the
brett
character
is
excellent
and
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
best
bretted
saisons
i
have
had
recently
i
recommend
this
highly
dry
crisp
with
a
nice
citrus
fruity
juiciness
this
is
a
funky
american
saison
that
is
worth
the
hype
i
think
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
saisons
i
have
ever
tasted
complex
and
funky
but
sublimely
smooth
and
eminently
drinkable
this
is
a
really
good
beer
thats
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
brett
is
amazing
as
usual
most
of
the
time
i
dont
care
for
beers
that
are
subtle
but
this
is
one
exception
o
a
decent
example
of
a
brett
inoculated
saison
but
the
alcohol
bite
and
huge
hop
spice
is
a
little
too
much
i
actually
have
a
nonbrett
home
brewed
saison
at
this
abv
and
made
with
huge
amounts
of
ekg
hops
and
i
have
a
similar
problem
in
fact
it
tastes
almost
identical
minus
the
brett
tropical
fruit
flavors
glad
i
tried
it
tho
the
finish
is
dry
a
slightly
disappointing
brew
poured
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
very
true
to
style
for
a
saison
quite
nice
scents
of
sour
brett
yeast
apricot
fruity
esters
and
some
spicy
belgian
yeast
despite
the
sour
overtones
there
is
a
nice
underlying
frutiness
that
is
the
hallmark
of
a
good
saison
very
nice
wild
yet
very
much
a
saison
flavor
is
quite
sour
upfront
with
a
lemony
character
alongside
sour
green
apple
and
green
grape
skin
in
the
middle
the
sourness
continues
but
hints
of
pepper
are
also
present
finish
is
dry
and
sour
with
some
slightly
grainy
notes
aftertaste
is
sour
brett
yeast
and
lemon
a
very
good
sour
saison
with
a
large
amount
of
sourness
yet
still
with
the
backbone
of
the
style
present
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
feel
good
true
to
style
and
quite
nice
overall
this
is
an
excellent
sour
saison
that
provides
a
good
wild
sour
ale
but
also
an
excellent
saison
the
flavors
aroma
and
mouthfeel
mingle
to
make
this
one
quite
enjoyable
highly
recommended
overall
just
keripes
wow
a
fantastic
saison
its
pear
juice
woah
that
explains
the
green
like
skin
i
get
perhaps
i
think
the
only
thing
that
doesnt
make
me
score
this
higher
is
that
it
doesnt
quite
remind
me
of
a
classic
big
brett
saison
all
time
highlight
sublime
beer
highly
recommended
will
have
again
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
a
brett
saison
the
pear
provides
a
fruitiness
and
juiciness
that
is
not
always
found
in
a
saison
and
the
brett
gives
an
overall
dry
flavor
character
to
the
drink
with
the
heart
of
the
belgian
and
french
farmlands
in
mind
its
assuring
to
know
that
beer
lovers
of
the
pacific
northwest
have
more
to
whet
their
whistle
than
only
hoppy
ale
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
session
i
wouldnt
say
i
love
beers
with
brett
but
this
one
had
the
right
amount
and
not
too
much
to
make
this
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
perfect
warm
weather
reach
for
this
was
my
first
venture
with
the
logsdon
crew
but
definitely
not
my
last
very
reasonably
priced
as
well
which
is
sweet
orangeish
somewhat
cloudy
pour
with
a
nice
head
of
lightfrothy
texture
the
frothiness
of
the
head
is
really
outstanding
somewhat
funky
finish
is
preceded
by
a
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
notes
of
spice
and
citrus
through
to
an
earthy
finish
nice
beer
while
there
are
a
number
of
brettinfused
saisons
on
the
market
today
seizoen
bretta
takes
the
cake
in
terms
of
overall
complexity
and
mouthfeel
i
aged
my
bottle
for
nearly
a
year
and
would
recommend
others
to
do
likewise
if
you
want
the
brett
to
be
kickin
just
be
careful
when
you
pop
the
cap
one
of
my
very
favorite
saisons
never
fails
yes
this
is
the
masterpiece
i
remembered
the
first
one
i
had
being
this
is
the
epitome
of
the
farmhouse
saison
style
all
saisons
with
brett
should
be
judged
against
this
one
lets
get
this
straight
its
not
the
best
saison
ive
had
but
its
the
one
that
laid
out
the
cards
and
said
beat
this
queens
high
royal
flush
this
is
a
win
except
in
the
refreshment
department
its
a
bit
heavier
than
most
saisons
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
though
oi
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
did
not
let
me
down
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
drinkable
and
it
pairs
well
with
the
flavor
profile
here
this
is
a
very
balanced
beer
with
a
subtle
complexity
that
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
flavor
but
still
provides
plenty
to
think
about
on
the
palate
unlike
a
lot
of
brett
beers
i
could
drink
this
regularly
and
repeatedly
and
not
get
tired
of
it
light
mildly
funky
nose
and
floral
crisp
mildly
funky
taste
i
didnt
really
have
any
expectations
either
way
for
this
brew
but
i
was
so
impressed
i
went
out
and
bought
another
one
immediately
looking
forward
to
checking
out
more
from
these
folks
thanks
to
bstyle
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this

i
get
tangernine

and
a
hint
of

it
all
comes
off
a

wittelike
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
mild
brett
presence
towards
the
middleback
its
not
overly
bold
and
has
just
a
slightly
medicinal
character
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
trace
of
acidity
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
bit
more
than
the
standard
seizoen
however
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
brett
perhaps
some
extended
cellaring
might
help
bring
that
quality
out
light
orange
with
a
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
in
a
film
of
a
head
awesome
outhouse
aroma
with
hints
of
earth
pear
oranges
lemons
hey
there
is
some
slight
undertone
of
funk
like
fresh
cheese
taste
is
sublime
just
layers
and
layers
very
dry
but
also
very
much
zest
perhaps
the
most
zesty
beer
i
have
tasted
there
is
also
some
lemons
very
acidic
just
explosion
of
lemon
fruits
with
a
perfect
carbonation
some
slight
hint
of
peppercorn
and
spices
just
an
awesome
saison
incredibly
well
executed
m
exceptionally
dry
light
to
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
seizoen
bretta
is
an
excellently
made
american
saison
juicy
fruit
easy
going
brett
additions
and
a
great

make
this
one
of
the
better
american
versions
ive
had
in
a
while
the
mouthfeel
has
that
belgian
frothy
quality
but
is
a
touch
overdone
minor
gripe
ive
had
my
eye
on
this
beer
for
a
while
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
give
it
a
whirl
thanks
again
scott
above
average
saison
nice
mild
fruit
contribution
to
an
otherwise
straightforward
saison
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
tart
orval
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
since
usually
when
i
see
it
im
traveling
and
usually
have
other
things
to
bring
home
highly
recommend
though
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
saison
medium
bodied
and
with
strong
carbonation
and
prominent
funky
brett
flavor
one
dimensional
with
all
brett
and
mineral
flavor
musty
funky
and
earthy
farmhouse
yeast
along
with
very
subtle
citrus
fruit
and
bready
yeast
character
the
mouthfeel
is
off
and
there
is
a
surprising
lack
of
complexity
disappointing
o
a
great
blend
of
flavors
nice
to
see
a
beer
like
this
from
a
us
brewery
overall
4

this
is
a
really
really
great
brettforward
saison
this
beer
executes
and
integrates
a
really
bright
vibrant
brett
character
with
a
relatively
straightforward
classicish
albeit
not
very
spicy
or
herbal
saison
base
it
just
gets
juicier
with
that
tangy
fruit
character
as
it
warms
up
too
considering
how
big
this
is
this
is
astoundingly
bright
easydrinking
and
even
kind
of
light
extremely
fullflavored
and
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
o
awesome
offering
from
lodgson
pretty
complex
with
a
great
balance
of
flavors
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
definitely
a
goto
saison
what
a
beautiful
beer
this
is
it
really
puts
most
brettinfused
saisons
to
shame
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
brett
they
are
using
comes
naturally
in
the
barrel
and
rather
it
further
accentuates
the
fruit
and
spice
notes
as
well
as
the
intriguing
addition
of
pear
juice
that
produces
secondary
fermentation
id
imagine
this
would
age
very
well
in
the
bottle
itd
be
a
little
less
fruit
forward
and
green
but
the
dryness
and
spice
plethora
would
make
it
even
more
vinous
than
it
even
is
every
variant
of
their
saizoen
series
has
been
fantastic
but
for
the
sake
of
everyday
drinking
this
is
probably
my
favorite
and
also
one
of
my
favorite
farmhouse
ales
made
in
the
us
period
i
havent
heard
a
ton
about
this
brewery
but
seizoen
bretta
is
the
real
deal
an
undertheradar
brew
for
sure
seek
it
out
and
be
impressed
by
it
if
you
love
brettanomyces
i
mean
really
love
it
then
this
beer
is
for
you
o
i
assume
this
translates
to
bretty
saison
bout
sums
it
up
not
that
im
complaining
mind
you
its
dang
tasty
and
i
will
definitely
buy
again
o
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
topnotch
i
think
its
my
first
5
ive
awarded
in
the
category
they
also
nailed
the
appearance
the
typical
belgian
brett
flavors
are
there
on
the
tongue
and
it
has
the
typical
saison
dryness
two
criticisms
1
my
bottle
was
a
gusher
and
2
i
wish
the
beer
had
more
body
it
seems
a
tad
bit
too
light
to
me
otherwise

you
will

i
just
rated
the

a

it
should
be
a

overall
i
love
this
i
like

a
lot
and
this
is
their
best
beer
by
far
the
nose
is
perfect
would
love
to
get
this
one
again
sometime
hope
it
comes
to
nyc
more
often
overall
a
tremendously
enjoyable
beer
i
would
be
very
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
im
sure
the
peach
aroma
would
fade
but
the
brett
more
developed
brett
character
could
add
many
layers
of
complexity
4

paws
overall
another
rocksolid
brew
from
logsdon
worth
the
trouble
hunting
this
down
tmo
that
is
a
lot
of
brett
and
a
lot
of
peach
i
guess
its
an
accurate
name
the
two
dominant
flavors
battle
throughout
the
maintaste
neither
particularly
winning
though
perhaps
the
brett
in
the
long
run
funky
dry
and
very

peach
is
a
nice

taste
it
aged
o
this
is
all
about
the
peach
and
it
showcases
it
brilliantly
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
imo
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
sour
a
style
that
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
goes
down
easy
for
10abv
one
of
the
biggest
let
downs
ive
had
smelled
like
delsym
cough
syrup
and
tasted
like
peach
perfume
not
pleasant
at
all
id
did
look
very
pretty
though
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
fruited
saison
i
wasnt
sure
how
i
would
like
the
peaches
in
the
base
since
i
didnt
especially
like
the
base
beer
but
the
spice
and
funk
really
mellows
and
enhances
the
natural
flavor
of
the
fruit
this
is
a
terrific
beer
one
of
the
more
unique
and
well
made
beers
ive
had
of
these
style
a
rich
beer
that
pours
like
a
meal
a
beautiful
and
delicious
beer
full
of
peach
taste
and
especially
aroma
its
an
amplified
version
of
seizoen
bretta
which
is
already
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
brett
dryness
and
fruity
taste
are
perfectly
balanced
whats
especially
wild
is
that
the
beers
appearance
is
opaque
and
pulpy
from
all
the
peach
bits
floating
around
in
it
just
dont
expect
a
ridiculously
strong
and
sweet
peach
juice
taste
as
this
is
still
certainly
a
brett
beer
that
just
happens
to
have
peach
as
one
of
its
main
ingredients
its
all
in
perfect
balance
here
and
they
clearly
hit
what
they
were
going
for
and
this
really
doesnt
taste
like
10
i
could
drink
it
all
day
crisp
fizzy
fruity
funky
just
delicious
awesome
aroma
of
peaches
and
apricots
totally
hazy
light
peach
colored
body
spicy
peaches
at
first
in
the
flavor
tartness
is
assertive
brett
flavors
come
out
more
in
finish
very
nice
though
a
750ml
was
a
bit
much
to
finish
by
myself
wholly
peach
and
brett
batman
these
two
equally
dominate
the
smell
and
taste
with
some
alcohol
esters
not
really
sour
very
balanced
and
good
something
about
me
and
certain
fruited
wild
ales
that
i
just
cant
get
over
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
a
truly
unique
brew
maybe
the
best
example
of
peaches
in
a
beer
ive
ever
seen
its
hazy
and
pale
heady
as
they
come
faint
glowing
orange
im
smelling
the
fizzy
ripe
yellow
peach
sweet
and
like
nothing
else
nature
produces
the
brett
is
intense
mature
getting
tart
rather
than
just
funky
there
is
also
this
creamy
vanilla
aroma
that
is
supported
by
a
heavy
wheat
malt
base
and
patience
the
flavor
is
an
oh
my
god
moment
or
series
of
moments
each
sip
im
floored
by
this
its
so
unique
the
peaches
and
the
brett
are
elevated
well
beyond
where
they
have
gone
in
other
beers
to
the
point
of
being
explosive
on
the
palate
i
like
the
bottle
more
and
more
as
it
drinks
down
too
the
dregs
being
almost
my
favorite
part
because
of
how
alive
it
all
seems
to
be
the
peaches
and
brett
are
the
perfect
combination
its
just
incredible
my
mouth
waters
for
more
as
i
write
this
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
puckery
dry
finish
thats
about
as
expressive
as
brett
can
be
nothing
subtle
about
it
but
expertly
refined
i
absolutely
must
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
magic
a
big
thanks
again
to
jeff
for
this
hyped
and
hardtocomeby
brew
certainly
worthy
of
praise
this
is
one
of
the
more
unique
peach
sours
ive
come
across
not
so
much
tart
but
really
uses
the
sweet

o
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
given
how
long
it
took
me
to
chase
it
down
its
definitely
good
but
the
flavor
isnt
as
complex
as
i
was
led
to
expect
this
one
hit
the
spot
the
nose
is
unbelievable
10
is
completely
hidden
not
sure
if
id
age
this
one
with
the
peaches
kicking
ass
right
now
another
one
of
those
beers
i
want
to
drink
the
day
its
bottled
and
five
years
down
the
road
the
flavor
notes
are
fruity
with
notes
of
peach
and
pear
juice
softness
and
funky
brett
character
are
present
in
the

leaves
the
tongue
very
clean
and
ready
for
the

o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
perfectly
matches
the
acidity
dryness
and
funk
of
the
brett
with
the
freshness
of
peaches
and
it
reminiscent
of
matching
cheese
and
fruit
while
this
beer
was
difficult
to
find
it
was
definitely
worth
the
effort
verdict
sensational
saison
from
logsdon
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
the
peaches
are
showcased
perfectly
without
undermining
the
base
beer
or
the
style
and
crossing
over
into
a
wild
ale
this
is
definitely
a
must
try
and
just
a
spectacular
beer
t
opens
with
a
tart
note
of
peach
and
peach
skin
with
a
trace
of
underripe
raspberry
peeking
through
a
big
wave
of
barnyard
funk
follows
and
it
leaves
a
dry
tannic
feel
on
your
tongue
soft
oak
brett
peach
pit
and
chalky
malt
everything
is
really
well
balanced
and
the
peaches
are
a
great
addition
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
tight
carbonation
that
allows
all
of
the
flavors
to
come
through
without
being
too
distracting
the
slightest
bit
of
warmness
on
the
swallow
is
the
only
trace
of
the
10
a
really
well
done
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
large
white
head
aroma
of
mildly
tart
peaches
upfront
some
wild
yeast
and
a
little
oak
peaches
mostly
though
flavor
brings
out
potent
peaches
upfront
quickly
transitioning
to
tart
peaches
lots
of
brett
and
a
little
oak
extremely
peachy
and
mildly
wild

loads
of
complexity

very

quite
awhile
before
receding

palate
is
peachy
spicy
moderately
funky
with
a
beautiful
balance
among
the
three
the
tartness
is
somewhat
restrained
but
its
level
works
perfectly
one
of
the
best
peach
sours
ive
had
the
privilege
to
enjoy
o
excellent
drinking
experience
one
of
the
best
peach
beers
i
think
ill
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
its
a
nice
improvement
on
the
base
seizoenbretta
and
i
cant
imagine
the
peach
will
stay
around
for
much
longer
this
is
a
beer
i
definitely
recommend
drinking
fresh
o
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
fruity
funky
spicy
earthy
buttery
and
dry
i
can
see
why
this
is
so
highly
regarded
having
never
had
this
aged
id
still
say
drink
fresh
the
brett
would
develop
further
but
at
the
cost
of
the
peach
wish
i
had
more
cheers
cheers
my
jump
into
the
deep
end
of
the
sour
pool
continues
with
these
guys
this
was
also
pretty
good
overall
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
it
brings
to
mind
just
how
disappointing
it
is
that
brewing
with
fresh
fruit
is
such
an
expensive
proposition
because
when
done
well
beers
with
fresh
fruit
are
hard
to
beat
this
one
is
no
different
and
whoever
thought
of
adding
that
distinctive
yeast
known
as
brettanomyces
to
a
peachinfused
beer
was
a
genius
the
natural
characteristics
of
the
fruit
work
well
with
the
funk
of
the
brett
i
will
likely
buy
this
every
time
i
have
the
opportunity
as
it
is
outstanding
word
to
the
wise
despite
what
the
bottle
may
say
this
is
not
a
beer
to
be
aged
peach
fades
fast
so
drink
this
fresh
age
the
base
beer
instead
2014
vintage
so
happy
i
snagged
a
bottle
of
this
apparently
only
a
few
cases
made
it
to
the
central
valley
this
year
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
fairly
quickly
scent
is
amazing
packed
with
wild
yeast
and
peaches
especially
as
this
beer
warms
the
peach
aroma
builds
up
and
the
brett
comes
out
beautifully
taste
is
a
little
more
tart
than
the
aroma
would
imply
which
is
never
a
bad
thing
peach
skin
and
funky
farmhouse
flavors
up
front
slightly
tart
peach
flavors
with
great
farmhouse
flavors
and
barnyard
hay
this
beer
is
not
spicy
at
all
straight
up
fruit
barnyard
and
funk
so
damn
tasty
the
peach
comes
out
more
and
more
with
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
and
fullbodied
drinkability
is
very
high
as
the
abv
is
wellhidden
this
10
farmhouse
ale
is
not
boozy
in
the
slightest
bit
overall
logsdon
never
seems
to
disappoint
especially
with
this
one
such
an
amazing
farmhouse
ale
the
peaches
shine
brilliantly
in
this
one
believe
the
hype
overall
never
had
anything
like
this
before
and
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
hype
however
ive
heard
that
this
years
batch
was
better
fresh
than
last
years
left
the
farmhouse
with
plenty
of
bottles
to
see
how
they
age
moderately
sour
upfront
lightly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
definite
peach
taste
and
aroma
seemed
a
little
more
prevalent
in
the
taste
overall
a
great
wild
ale
brett
wasnt
all
that
expressive
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
peach
sour
ale
imho
having
a
saison
showdown
this
week
and
this
overshadows
prairies
eliza5beth
pretty
substantially
still
have
a
few
more
which
may
stack
up
against
this
convivial
suarez
and
le
saissonier
coming
next
an
orchard
in
a
glass
lovely
fragrant
nose
that
is
pure
high
summer
peaches
the
color
is
a
golden
amber
not
unlike
a
bellini
the
taste
is
very
fruit
forward
one
of
the
biggest
peachflavored
beers
ive
had
this
side
of
chez
monus
you
can
almost
feel
the
peach
juice
dribbling
down
your
chin
absolutely
lovely
the
sweet
peach
is
firmed
up
by
a
bit
of
brett
funkiness
and
the
barrel
oak
this
is
as
close
to
summer
as
you
are
going
to
get
after
a
long
cold
winter
great
beer
but
i
think
i
still
might
prefer
the
seizoen
bretta
a
bit
more
the
subtleties
of
the
saison
are
drowned
out
a
bit
by
the
intense
peachiness
still
a
great
beer
edit
from
41214
as
others
have
noted
this
is
not
a
beer
to
age
or
sit
on
sampled
one
of
two
bottles
i
still
have
left
from
the
most
recent
release
and
the
peach
flavor
is
already
starting
to
subside
a
bit
it
was
stil
tasty
but
when
very
fresh
the
peach
flavor
is
prominent
and
just
amazing
whereas
now
its
just
one
more
voice
in
the
flavor
profile
chorus
still
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
when
very
fresh
this
beer
is
just
out
of
this
world
overall
great
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
the
20
bucks
i
would
definitely
take
one
of
these
over
any
cascade
beer
not
that
theyre
necessarily
comparable
but
in
regard
to
the
price
point
reminds
me
a
lot
of
la
fin
du
monde
which
also
doesnt
have
great
complexity
but
is
exceptional
at
the
few
things
it
does
do
a
must
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
while
im
scoring
this
lower
than
what
i
scored
seizoen
bretta
im
under
the
impression
that
this
is
a
better
beer
i
will
have
to
sample
the
regular
bretta
again
to
compare
this
is
a
lightly
watery
feeling
brew
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
it
is
sadly
cabonic
an
overall
just
ok
i
have
tried
to
approach
this
brewery
with
positive
anxious
thoughts
but
everytime
i
try
their
goods
im
left
underwhelmed
i
would
drink
this
again
if
given
the
opportunity
but
really
i
dont
see
this
as
anything
special
or
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
perhaps
this
was
an
off
bottle
this
is
a
20
proof
beer
no
way
i
could
easily
down
an
entire
bottle
of
this
without
complaint
i
would
love
to
have
a
fresher
bottle
and
open
it
right
away
but
the
brett
here
seems
to
build
on
some
wonderful
creative
aspects
towards
the
beers
development
this
could
easily
be
the
best
beer
logsdon
has
made
so
far
and
its
impressive
that
theyve
made
a
beer
of
this
caliber
so
drinkable
and
readily
available
for
any
occasion
as
well
excellent
stuff
to
me
this
beer
is
perfect
because
i
can
read
a
fucking
label
this
beer
might
be
as
good
as
it
gets
for
me
especially
in
terms
of
style
logsdon
makes
an
unreal
saison
their
brett
version
is
one
of
my
top
ten
beers
ive
had
and
i
love
peaches
this
beer
delivered
all
of
that
the
color
of
the
body
almost
had
a
peach
skin
note
to
it
the
beer
smells
of
fresh
peaches
the
taste
is
everything
that
is
great
about
seizoen
bretta
but
with
beautful
peach
and
floral
notes
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
and
cant
wait
to
get
myself
a
bottle
medium
bodied
with
a
prominent
musty
brett
character
along
with
dry
oak
and
sour
peach
the
dry
brett
flavor
is
really
strong
with
musty
funk
perfectly
complimenting
the
farmhouse
yeast
oak
is
drytoasted
but
blends
nicely
with
the
bugs
and
funky
yeast
notes
peaches
come
in
at
the
end
with
a
luscious
organic
feel
not
cloying
or
overly
sweet
with
some
sour
acidity
lingering
in
the
finish
slightly
puckering
with
pit
and
fleshy
fruit
flavor
very
complex
but
its
one
of
most
balanced
beers
ive
ever
had
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
nearly
perfect
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
regular
seizoen
or
seizoen
bretta
but
i
highly
recommend
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
try
this
one
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
still
cant
get
over
how
drinkable
this
is
i
had
to
stop
myself
from
gulping
it
down
too
quickly
definitely
recommend
seeking
out
a
bottle
or
two
o
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
considering
my
expectations
not
nearly
as
peachy
as
i
had
hoped
overall
quite
dry
and
earthy
in
character
with
a
strong
alcoholic
aspect
that
detracts
a
bit
o
really
a
great
peach
saison
that
balances
well
between
the
peach
and
the
sour
and
funky
presence
oa
tad
bit
more
sour
notes
and
this
could
be
perfect
easily
the
best
peach
beer
on
the
market
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
but
as
a
lover
of
puckering
sour
beers
this
just
does
not
get
there
it
has
a
high
abv
and
a
saison
finish
but
it
does
not
have
the
intense
sour
fruit
notes
i
enjoy
rollicking
fruit
saison
if
a
little
too
big
for
its
boots
bemused
as
to
why
this
needed
to
be
10
o
fruit
is
less
prominent
than
a
bottle
opened
a
few
weeks
prior
but
still
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
i
see
it
as
a
nice
sipper
on
a
warm
day
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
bought
a
bottle
from
the
brewery
and
shared
it
five
days
later
in
a
hotel
room
with
one
other

really
hard
to
believe
this
is

not
to
mention
how
subtle
the
brett
and
sweetness
from
the
fruits
are
no

the

perhaps
apricots
mouthfeel

this
beer
is
pretty
incredible
i
have
to
say
i
dont
get
much
brett
but
lots
of
peach
and
an
extremely
wellhidden
abv
big
thanks
to
harrymel
for
this
gem
o
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
nice
but
not
as
complex
or
pleasant
as
the
seizoen
bretta
i
had
just
two
weeks
ago
the
mouthfeel
held
this
back
for
me
quite
a
bit
a
little
too
watery
but
a
nice
brett
beer
cant
believe
this
is

the

brett
go
well
together
creating
a

and
enjoyable
saison
o
exceedinglynay
dangerouslydrinkable
a
very
well
executed
farmhouse
ale
the
fruit
is
prominent
but
not
overwhelming
i
guess
if
i
had
any
complaints
it
would
be
that
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
oak
character
and
the
brett
is
pretty
minimal
o
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
was
really
hoping
that
the
peaches
would
be
ridiculously
over
the
top
but
it
wasnt
still
the
flavors
are
great
and
the
brett
funk
is
just
right
i
am
incredibly
happy
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
cost
20
for
a
750
ml
bottle
drink
it
was
a
good
beer
but
again
didnt
blow
me
away
i
think
letting
a
bottle
sit
might
help
i
truly
feel
this
wouldve
been
better
as
say
a
wild
ale
with
more
of
a
light
flavor
and
more
peche
behind
it
i
am
glad
this
was
at
a
share
and
not
a
traded
bottle
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
worth
the
hype
i
have
a
few
bottles
myself
and
i
think
jared
just
got
an
old
bottle
as
there
really
should
have
been
more
peaches
in
this
wow
what
a
truly
unique
and
amazing
beer
perfect
amount
of
peaches
and
a
nice
compliment
to
their
wonderful
brett
profile
i
thought
this
one
was
a
huge
improvement
over
the
seizoen
bretta
although
that
was
still
very
good
took
me
by
surprise
but
i
hope
ill
have
the
chance
to
enjoy
this
one
again
top
notch
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
sticky
white
head
on
top
nice
thin
retention
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
fruity
and
has
a
subtle
grainy
backbone
in
there
some
really
nice
aromas
on
this
one
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
mellow
there
is
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
peche
and
a
very
subtle
tart
brett
finish
very
smooth
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
overall
its
very
good
really
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
very
nice
saison
with
plenty
of
peaches
nothing
too
mind
blowing
but
a
very
high
quality
beer
like
everything
from
this
brewer
near
turbid
golden
with
a
central
dome
of
light
cream
foam
and
little
lace
the
nose
is
really
nice
peaches
apricots
brett
seltzer
vitamins
tart
tones
and
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
at
the
end
nice
tartness
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
some
brett
watery
character
some
bits
of
lacto
style
yogurt
character
and
plenty
of
peach
but
the
peach
seems
unripened
medium
on
full
bodied
with
hi
carb
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
me
quite
dry
this
forces
me
to
take
another
drink
sadlynot
nice
beer
overall
other
than
the
flavor
profile
this
is
a
really
solid
saison
i
can
only
hope
that
a
fresher
batch
would
be
tastier
and
hope
to
track
one
down
at
some
point
8
410
o
nice
saison
with
some
tart
and
sweet
peaches
i
will
say
as
it
warmed
it
improved
modestly
with
some
more
funk
notes
permeating
the
palate
but
unless
you
can
get
it
on
the
cheap
and
dont
have
to
give
up
much
in
a
trade
id
rather
just
spend
that
money
on
some
rr
varieties
with
a
good
sushi
lunch
overall
really
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
beer
its
the
best
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
logsden
fastastia
just
edged
out
the
peche
n
brett
in
the
side
by
side
had
side
by
side
with
fantasia
and
i
give
a
slight
edge
to
fantasia
id
say
worth
seeking
out
if
you
dont
have
to
pay
an
arm
and
a
leg
base
beer
is
great
as
well
thanks

d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summertime
beer
its
quite
pricey
for
a
bottle
of
this
but
well
worth
it
in
my
opinion
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
peach
beers
ive
loved
everything
so
far
from
logsdon
this
was
a
real
treat
a
very
nice
beer
but
maybe
not
all
the
way
up
to
the
hype
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
orange
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
offers
peaches
brett
shocker
wild
yeast
funk
straightforward
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
really
nice
juicy
peaches
throughout
mild
acidity
with
fairly
low
carbonation
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
finish
mild
bitterness
as
well
really
tasty
rated
via
beer
buddy
for
iphone
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
slightly
funky
with
peach
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fermented
peach
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
despite
its
abv
overall
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
drinks
well
but
peaches
are
too
light
and
funk
isnt
as
much
as
i
expected
either
less
peachy
more
brett
forward
than
when
fresh
slightly
sulfury
farty
with
the
peach
being
more
of
a
tart
peach
character
than
the
bright
complex
redolent
peach
character
that
it
had
fresh
that
said
its
still
fleshy
and
mildly
frothy
the
palate
still
has
a
ton
of
peach
but
it
does
seem
to
have
lost
some
of
the
brash
brilliance
of
its
youth
the
peach
juice
has
fermented
out
leaving
an
earthy
spicy
brett
character
moderately
sweet
nonetheless
this
is
still
very
good
closer
to
a
4
3
than
4
6
fresh
yeast
character
is
moderate
and
a
faint
heat
are
noticeable
overall
this
is
a
top
tier
wild
ale
no
doubt
i
think
i
prefer
mimosa
a
tad
more
and
oak
aged
bretta
more
than
both
i
absolutely
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
soon
o
really
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
recently
certainly
lives
up
to
its
reputation
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
logsdon
saisons
o
after
tasting
this
beer
at
least
5
times
its
safe
to
say
a
terrific
beer
considering
the
best
by
dating
on
all
bottles
extends
5
years
into
the
future
all
are
pretty
young
so
itll
be
interesting
to
taste
them
again
in
2
3
4
years
or
more
suffice
to
say
the
peach
is
upfront
right
now
the
tartness
zesty
and
aggressive
thank
goodness
there
are
a
few
cellared
to
taste
later
well
played

a
pours
a
light
straw
color
orangeish
really
very
cloudy
nice
big

white
lots
of
small
bubbles
creamy
very
good
lacing
quite
a
pretty
beer
nice
aroma
of
saison
funk
and
smokey
peaches
the
peach
character
is
fresh
and
deep
it
has
a
very
light
smoke
fruit
character
lots
of
yeast
earthiness
a
bit
mineralish
its
a
cultured
peach
flavor
not
terribly
jammy
or
pungent
but
a
rustic
citrus
peach
wood
flavor
taste
starts
with
sweeter
peaches
and
turns
to
sourer
drier
territory

is
lightly

very
smooth
and
nice
for
the
abv
very
happy
to
try
this
one
big
thank
you
to
westcstbrlvr
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
logsdon
less
peachy
and
more
saison
appletartness
than
i
remember
but
still
very
enjoyable
dangerously
drinkable
at
10
abv
my
wife
really
liked
it
one
of
the
best
farmhouse
ales
at
least
top
3
that
i
ever
enjoyed
m
medium
bodied
it
was
hard
to
drink
this
one
slowly
amazing
balance
totally
delicious
doesnt
supersede
the
base
beer
for
me
but
i
love
how
they
integrated
the
peach
not
at
all
overdone
hazy
peach
body
thin
layer
of
beige
bubble
tastes
like
a
logsdon
beer
the
brett
is
in
full
force
aging
this
beer
seems
foolish
the
glorious
peach
notes
hit
in
the
finish
and
are
a
real
nice
contrast
of
sweettart
grassy
funky
some
oak
bready
notes
fantastic
stuff
o
highly
recommended
im
curious
to
see
how
this
one
ages
its
so
good
though
that
im
afraid
my
last
bottle
will
be
gone
too
soon
to
find
out
o
awesome
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
of
a
letdown
so
talked
up
i
generally
assume
that
it
cant
actually
be
that
good
this
one
lived
up
to
its
reputation
i
would
put
this
above
any
other
saison
ive
had
and
that
is
how
i
would
characterize
it
after
drinking
it
reads
as
a
beautiful
saison
with
fruit
the
brett
is
apparent
but
if
you
put
this
next
to
their
other
brews
the
comparison
would
be
obvious
i
think
interested
to
see
how
this
ages
as
the
fruit
fades
and
the
brett
takes
a
funkier
and
stronger
role
poured
a
murky
gloden
orange
in
color
with
pale
yellow
highlights
a
half
finger
of
bubbly
head
that
left
good
wisps
of
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
good
funky
bretty
character
and
peach
fruit
were
noticeable
upfron
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
spice
herbs
and
wood
oak
with
nice
tarf
qualities
the
peach
fruit
was
more
apparent
on
the
palate
with
good
bretty
barnyard
funk
slight
spice
hints
of
citrus
zest
alongside
great
oaky
accents
and
a
touch
of
apple
pear
flavor
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
oaky
fruity
bretty
funky
slight
spice
and
tar
finish
these
dudes
really
now
how
to
funk
it
up
in
past
years
i
have
given
this
beer
a
4
5
but
im
not
crazy
about
the
2015
release
smells
great
but
tastes
very
perfumey
and
that
aggressive
logsdon
brett
strain
comes
across
slightly
soapy
in
this
case
huge
huge
thanks
to
boralyl
for
this
one
served
in
a
cervoise
pours
a
slightlycloudy
light
peach
color
wow
lets
start
that
way
nose
has
huge
peach
plus
earth
and
mild
funk
dry
and
a
bit
creamy
dry
touch
acidic
some
wheat
incredible
logsdon
has
really
got
some
good
things
going
o
this
is
incredibly
wellbalanced
and
easydrinking
theres
no
hint
of
the
10
the
brett
and
fruit
are
at
a
perfect
level
of
expression
very
impressive
something
i
could
drink
all
day
o
really
great
peach
flavor
feels
like
peach
vodka
with
fresh
peaches
swimming
in
it
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
little
a
little
more
peach
flavor
to
balance
the
saison
backbone
but
that
aside
this
is
probably
the
best
farmhouse
ale
and
definitely
the
best
organically
produced
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
wild
ale
per
say
because
it
was
more
rustic
and
less
overly
sour
or
tart
the
fact
that
this
was
10
was
ridiculous
it
drinks
like
7
max
not
a
drop
of
alcohol
i
would
say
crack
this
asap
as
i
believe
the
peach
flavor
is
fading
and
the
brett
is
really
taking
hold
i
definitely
plan
to
seek
out
more
beers
from
this
new
oregon
farmhouse
brewer
o
definitely
the
most
surprising
beer
of
the
two
day
tasting
which
included
the
4
ba
dls
rare
ba
speedway
damon
and
many
other
good
ones
the
10
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
this
i
sure
wish
i
could
have
had
more
than
a
couple
ounces
of
this
stuff
fantastic
beer
and
one
ill
be
seeking
out
in
the
future
overall
great
fruit
flavor
but
the
beer
itself
isnt
necessarily
great
tasty
but
definitely
could
be
a
better
beer
o
not
a
peach
explosion
as
i
remembered
from
batch
1
but
a
nice
balance
and
very
layered
super
brew
simply
phenomenal
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
by
the
barrel
o
goodness
in
a
bottle
and
i
wish
this
wasnt
such
a
limited
release
definitely
not
a
beer
for
people
who
hate
this
particular
stone
fruit
though
im
hesitant
to
age
my
other
bottle
because
im
afraid
the
peaches
will
disappear
o
amazing
peachsaison
of
some
sort
i
wanted
more
but
the
bottle
was
crushed
in
1
minute
i
guess
ill
have
to
track
one
of
these
down
for
myself
my
wife
would
love
this
stuff
ogoddamn
this
is
a
good
beer
the
peaches
are
so
prevalent
and
taste
the
brett
characteristics
are
spot
on
and
again
the
peach
is
so
tasty
this
beer
is
dangerous
at
10
luckily
it
was
hard
to
come
by
this
one
and
one
for
the
cellar
until
the
next
release
david
logsdon
touche
d
perhaps
one
of
the
most
drinkable
10
beers
ive
ever
had
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
probably
would
consume
an
entire
750ml
bottle
if
i
didnt
know
there
was
a
monster
hangover
waiting
at
the
end
i
think
some
age
might
reveal
some
added
complexity
i
liked
this
a
fair
bit
more
than
seizoen
bretta
o
i
would
have
liked
a
little
a
little
more
tartness
and
sourness
for
a
wild
ale
but
it
was
really
nice
overall
the
fruity
sweetness
from
the
peach
was
really
a
treat
i
really
like
peaches
definitely
a
must
try
overall
exceptional
i
feel
fortunate
to
be
able
to
try
this
highly
recommended
overall
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
i
tried
the
base
beer
for
this
a
few
months
back
and
thought
it
was
quite
good
but
this
is
on
another
level
seek
this
out
o
grading
as
a
saison
its
very
good
i
enjoy
it
a
little
more
than
the
base
beer
but
not
for
twice
the
cash
not
that
price
is
a
problem
with
this
beer
if
you
saw
it
on
the
shelf
and
didnt
buy
a
bottle
you
already
missed
your
chance
recommended
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
the
sweetness
doesnt
even
come
off
as
even
belgian
strangely
its
got
some
really
fascinating
qualities
but
it
misses
the
classic
saison
character
and
depth
and
just
misses
the
mark
theres
a
real
interesting
beer
in
here
but
its
sort
of
all
over
the
place
this
is
a
decent
rendition
of
the
style
but
perhaps
it
left
me
begging
for
more
fruit
and
less
spice
o
i
actually
enjoyed
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
pretty
standard
example
of
a
saison
smooth
drinking
and
good
flavor
o
honestly
being
from
fff
this
would
have
a
unique
spin
if
it
had
a
touch
more
hops
though
its
tasty
and
fits
the
style
well
as
is
overall
i
absolutely
love
saisons
and
rabbid
rabbit
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
that
style
if
youve
not
had
this
you
are
truly
missing
out
o
a
very
good
but
not
exceptional
farmhouse
not
your
typical
brew
from
3f
but
well
done
the
only
knock
is
that
the
single
bomber
cost
as
much
as
a
4pack
of
my
favorite
of
this
style
making
this
particular
offering
hard
to
justify
usually
grab
anything
i
see
from
3
floyds
because
the
artwork
kicks
ass
and
they
all
tend
to
disappear
quickly
i
would
love
to
put
this
bunny
in
the
mall
for
easter
photos
pours
a
deep
golden
straw
color
smells
yeasty
and
sweet
typical
belgian
aromas
taste
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
cloves
maybe
corriander
and
pineapple
other
baking
spices
sweet
yeast
faint
banana
very
citrusy
with
a
crisp
finish
a
think
it
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
compared
to
a
lot
in
the
style
very
drinkabke
i
like
it
dinged
it
overall
just
because
12
bomber
price
tag
man
do
i
hate
it
when
i
find
a
beer
i
like
that
is
22oz
only
but
would
love
to
have
again
d
decent
brew
that
seemed
to
miss
the
mark
for
me
being
just
average
overall
its
pretty
good
its
a
little
to
light
and
thin
in
the
flavor
the
sweet
yeasts
add
lots
of
sweet
flavor
along
with
the
malt
backbone
to
provide
the
main
flavor
tastes
much
more
like
a
triple
solid
but
not
world
class
that
usually
fff
makes
o
looks
great
smells
good
and
tastes
ok
o
a
bit
sweet
for
a
saison
and
for
my
taste
personally
actually
let
me
rephrase
that
i
dont
like
the
rock
candy
added
and
the
more
of
this
beer
i
sip
i
really
dont
like
it
this
beer
changed
a
lot
from
the
first
pour
to
the
end
it
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
a
saison
well
it
looks
like
fff
can
deliver
a
slightly
funky
product
after
all
its
definitely
one
of
the
least
hoppy
offerings
ive
had
from
them
but
it
was
without
a
doubt
flavorful
and
in
particular
was
great
to
drink
outside
on
a
nice
day
as
i
did
the
floral
notes
are
fantastic
on
this
and
its
worth
buying
for
that
reason
alone
the
flavor
is
less
complex
overall
but
it
drinks
quite
well
its
a
good
way
to
take
a
departure
from
their
hoppier
offerings
yet
still
get
something
thats
complex
in
its
own
way
i
agree
with
the
reviewer
who
said
this
is
more
of
a
tripel
than
a
saison
this
is
not
a
saison
to
me
no
where
near
the
class
of
saisons
from
hill
farmstead
and
the
like
even
jolly
pumpkin
is
quite
a
bit
better
than
this
i
never
regret
trying
a
new
beer
especially
from
a
place
like
fff
but
this
is
not
one
i
will
try
again
considered
pouring
it
out
even
a
great
beer
but
to
me
more
of
a
tripel
than
a
saison
with
all
the
malt
sweetness
so
maybe
more
of
a
line
bender
than
anything
who
cares
really
taste
is
king
it
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
color
we
have
seen
this
before
in
the
globe
with
a
half
inch
of
lace
the
nose
is
very
sweet
big
malts
but
on
the
lighter
color
and
taste
spectrum
did
they
really
add
rock
candy
to
the
kettle
if
they
did
i
can
smell
and
taste
it
if
they
didnt
i
still
think
i
can
light
herbal
notes
in
nose
and
taste
too
like
green
tea
but
not
bitter
or
quite
as
earthy
more
of
a
grass
vibe
very
full
body
ultra
sweet
sticky
almost
but
the
belgian
yeast
makes
this
awesome
it
gives
it
a
slightly
dry
finish
for
all
the
sugar
and
it
unites
that
tea
element
perfectly
glad
i
had
folks
around
to
share
this
with
but
it
is
a
really
different
beer
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
27
bucks
for
a
bottle
at
revolution
brewing
in
chicago
but
id
say
it
was
worth
that
markup
for
a
first
timer
three
floyds
are
known
for
there
hop
use
but
this
is
up
to
par
with
some
of
their
better
known
beers
in
my
opinion
overall
eh
not
that
great
wouldnt
recommend
if
your
wanting
a
good
saison
but
not
really
bed
just
not
up
to
par
on
whats
available
out
there
o
this
is
a
strange
brew
its
fruity
dry
malty
and
very
beady
its
interesting
and
funky
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
79
trade
from
brewmane
thanks
pour
is
orange
golden
and
very
clear
with
nearly
no
head
at
all
interesting
for
the
style
aroma
is
strong
orange
pear
apple
honey
and
only
a
hint
of
yeast
funk
flavor
is
candy
sweet
apple
honey
flavor
thick
mouthfeel
for
style
but
with
light
effervescent
carbonation
lingering
carbonation
prickle
and
honey
sweetness
a
bit
dank
and
syrupy
decent
beer
but
heavy
for
this
style
worth
a
try
o
good
beer
i
lover
peppercorn
beers
so
i
might
rate
this
a
little
high
legitimately
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
if
you
dont
like
pepper
dont
buy
this
beer
its
basically
apple
juice
and
pepper
seriously
a
really
strange
yet
nice
saison
im
pretty
sure
i
can
count
in
one
hand
the
saisons
ive
tried
but
this
one
stands
out
as
different
sweeter
thicker
and
less
carbonated
than
i
expect
still
enjoyable
to
me
pours
hazy
yellowish
orange
with
a
bubbly
single
finger
head
funky
belgian
smell
some
straw
some
orange
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
smell
lots
of
belgian
yeast
some
sweet
orange
dry
straw
slight
hop
presence
the
texture
is
nice
good
carbonation
not
too
thin
overall
i
really
liked
this
for
a
warm
day
its
got
some
funk
nice
belgian
yeast
taste
slight
sweetness
but
does
leave
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
o
taste
was
really
quite
nice
and
not
indicative
of
the
rating
really
surprised
that
a
brewery
of
this
quality
would
miss
so
badly
on
some
of
the
key
components
of
the
style
not
that
it
was
a
bad
beer
it
wasnt
it
is
just
a
poor
example
of
a
saison
overall
it
was
significantly
better
and
fresher
on
draft
at
dark
lord
day
this
bottle
wasnt
that
great
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
offered
me
a
taste
but
its
definitely
not
worth
10bomber
to
me
o
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
the
taste
seems
slightly
muddled
compared
to
the
classic
aspects
of
the
style
cheers
a
wonderful
saison
fit
for
a
hot
day
just
for
the
information
the
saison
dupont
has
no
spices
no
sugar
its
100
pils
malt
continental
hops
and
yeast
everything
comes
from
the
yeast
even
the
high
attenuation
its
dry
and
highly
carbonated
i
really
dont
know
where
to
begin
with
the
taste
ive
had
really
flat
old
macro
largers
with
this
same
taste
nothing
jumps
out
some
pepper
some
apple
and
some
slight
banana
it
has
a
certain
wheat
ale
feel
to
it
its
is
nice
on
the
palate
but
thats
about
the
best
thing
going
for
it
i
love
three
floyds
their
seasonals
most
of
what
we
get
in
ohio
really
disappoint
me
most
of
the
time
o
solid
beer
would
drink
again
but
highly
overpriced
at
10
per
bomber
not
a
huge
fan
of
saison
ales
but
it
was
a
nice
change
up
and
the
anticipation
of
3f
beer
always
makes
for
a
good
time
it
is
definitely
not
your
typical
ale
and
has
some
distinguished
flavors
well
worth
a
try
o
disappointing
i
like
some
of
three
floyds
other
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
not
a
saison
it
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
instead
and
whatever
it
is
i
dont
care
for
it
o
not
so
sure
about
this
one
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
in
terms
of
saisons
and
farmhouses
there
are
a
lot
better
beers
out
there
at
a
lot
better
price
obalance
isnt
where
it
should
be
the
chamomile
is
too
dominate
overall
i
really
did
not
care
for
this
beer
its
labeled
a
saison
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
one
to
me
i
found
it
to
be
overly
spicy
and
lacking
in
fruitinesstartness
both
of
which
are
characteristic
of
saisons
the
low
carbonation
was
also
very
strange
and
unappealing
and
probably
the
worst
thing
about
this
beer
its
brewed
with
rock
candy
and
chamomile
which
i
found
interesting
but
ultimately
the
flavors
dont
mesh
well
and
the
resulting
brew
is
disappointing
i
would
never
buy
this
again
and
i
frankly
i
wouldnt
even
recommend
it
especially
at
an
inflated
11
a
bottle
o
this
style
is
not
a
strong
one
for
floyds
i
loved
zes
zes
zes
but
it
was
a
floyds
take
on
the
style
super
hopped
up
and
unique
appearance
is
gold
with
thin
layer
of
white
head
and
and
visible
yeast
chunks
nose
is
fragrant
with
notes
of
lavender
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
along
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
herbal
up
front
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
sweetness
up
front
with
cinnamon
present
wtf
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
all
this
is
incredibly
unique
but
not
my
favorite
rendition
on
the
style
aroma
is
spicy
and
bready
though
not
super
complex
taste
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
spices
are
surprisingly
absent
malt
takes
over
and
washes
away
any
hints
of
flavor
disappointing
across
the
board
fff
should
stick
to
ipas
stouts
i
feel
as
though
the
flavor
could
use
some
more
lemon
peel
and
spicing
emphasis
to
complement
all
of
the
herbal
focus
that
is
going
on
thats
my
main
constructive
criticism
for
this
one
theres
also
issues
with
low
carbonation
causing
texture
problems
but
its
more
important
to
keep
the
citrusy
bright
flavor
going
in
a
saison
than
to
work
on
the
texture
imo
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
saison
there
are
only
a
few
examples
produced
in
utah
so
i
need
to
try
ones
from
trading
i
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
goldenorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
little
bit
of
floaties
in
there
too
scent
is
quite
interesting
initially
sweet
bready
and
herbal
a
bit
of
funk
and
wet
dog
aroma
also
get
sweet
apples
and
cinnamon
a
bit
of
orange
peel
as
well
taste
is
at
first
grainy
and
a
bit
musty
with
some
sweet
apple
flavor
subdued
hops
with
belgian
yeast
and
bready
malt
flavors
tons
of
herbs
and
spices
somewhat
winterlike
very
unique
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
no
alcohol
flavor
detected
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
was
one
great
beer
not
very
typical
for
the
average
saison
as
it
is
unlike
any
one
i
have
tasted
before
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
wish
i
had
access
to
purchasing
it
myself
verdict
kind
of
a
blander
and
overly
sweet
beer
i
havent
really
had
a
belgian
style
from
fff
that
knocked
my
socks
off
aside
from
live
a
rich
life
but
cmon
thats
really
just
another
dipa
and
this
isnt
really
turning
the
needle
in
the
other
direction
not
that
it
was
bad
but
it
just
wasnt
memorable
this
is
good
stuff
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
dubbel
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
very
good
beer
pours
a
slightly
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
yeast
spice
and
some
chalky
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
very
peppery
spice
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
good
stuff
o
very
grateful
to
have
tried
this
beer
but
ultimately
this
is
just
a
little
too
strong
for
my
preference
in
saisons
as
always
its
great
to
experience
a
new
offering
from
3
floyds
o
between
the
yeast
and
thin
alcohol
it
reminds
me
of
a
tripel
but
it
is
still
clearly
a
saison
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
spiced
beer
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
very
refreshing
and
tasty
i
could
drink
this
all
night
hazy
bright
orange
with
a
dense
white
head
of
several
fingers
great
retention
and
lacing
lots
of
wheat
and
yeast
on
the
nose
bright
fruit
notes
and
a
dash
of
spice
lots
more
yeast
and
wheat
citrus
zest
and
a
good
spicy
component
good
hopping
as
well
no
real
alcohol
to
be
felt
medium
body
good
texture
with
a
medium
carbonation
quite
pleasing
for
such
a
warm
evening
overall
a
very
delicious
beer
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
but
i
really
liked
it
and
do
not
think
it
detracted
from
it
flavorful
crisp
and
biting
an
absolutely
delicious
beer
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
its
really
cloudy
even
for
a
saison
tight
white
head
the
smell
is
loaded
with
spicy
yeast
esters
there
an
odd
hint
of
tobacco
smoke
as
well
the
taste
is
very
spicy
like
they
added
black
pepper
lots
of
banana
and
a
light
body
very
peppery
and
spicy
yes
it
necessitates
being
mentioned
twice
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
not
as
funky
as
a
typical
saison
not
as
yeasty
as
a
wheat
beer
not
as
pure
hoppy
as
an
ipa
but
instead
is
a
mixture
of
the
three
and
more
with
its
peppery
notes
certainly
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
3f
beers
though
that
is
no
knock
since
it
would
be
like
saying
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
classic
corvettes
i
definitely
recommend
it
if
just
to
try
it
though
i
would
not
list
it
as
a
goto
3f
beer
for
me
pours
a
beautiful
glowing
cloudy
orange
body
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
in
my
new
tripel
karmeliet
glass
aroma
has
a
big
punch
of
citrus
and
herbal
spice
chalky
yeast
notes
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
coming
together
as
i
take
my
first
initial
sips
i
get
a
strong
assertive
bitterness
from
the
herbal
chamomile
citrus
peel
edges
and
strong
long
lasting
spicy
notes
from
the
yeast
bright
citric
notes
initially
followed
by
hints
of
bready
sweetness
all
followed
by
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
it
was
the
last
bottle
available
at
chalet
premier
in
north
lima
oh
worth
it
to
try
it
sense
ive
been
looking
for
this
beer
pretty
much
since
they
first
brewed
it
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
with
sturdy
carbonation
medium
bodied
yet
mellow
and
smooth
nothing
overbearing
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
i
welcomed
along
with
a
lasting
spicebitterness
on
the
palate
overall
a
truly
tasty
american
brewed
saison
which
was
definitely
worth
it
will
i
revisit
this
one
soon
probably
not
because
i
prefer
the
hoppy
3
floyds
offerings
after
writing
my
review
ive
started
eating
pizza
with
it
and
it
enhances
the
spice
of
the
pepperoni
and
crushed
red
pepper
this
is
light
easy
to
drink
with
a
spicy
kick
enjoy
moreys
bottom
line
an
above
average
saison
that
being
said
i
guess
that
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
fff
its
more
of
a
peppery
and
spicy
saison
as
opposed
to
the
tart
and
funky
ones
that
ive
been
drinking
as
of
late
well
crafted
but
its
just
a
little
tamer
than
i
was
anticipating
its
worth
a
shotbut
personally
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
o
nice
subtle
belgian
yeast
and
citrusy
lemon
perfect
for
a
hot
night
picked
up
this
bottle
at
the
last
dld
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
carbonation
was
really
nice
a
ring
of
bubbles
lingered
in
the
glass
till
the
last
sip
nice
medium
bodied
beer
had
very
prominent
bready
banana
yeasty
characters
in
the
aroma
department
the
first
sip
reinforced
the
smells
lots
of
bread
and
banana
very
light
hints
of
peppery
spice
on
the
tongue
normally
i
like
my
saisons
with
more
of
that
spiciness
but
this
beer
was
really
nice
just
the
same
wish
i
would
have
gotten
2
bottles
instead
of
just
the
one
o
good
beer
but
not
a
saison
at
all
a
hefe
im
glad
that
i
finally
sat
down
with
a
bottle
of
this
as
it
ending
up
being
a
rather
tasty
and
easy
sipping
take
on
a
saison
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
fruit
spice
and
hops
that
kept
this
interesting
to
drink
overall
likeable
glad
that
i
tried
this
but
could
go
either
way
returning
to
it
at
the
price
point
hard
for
me
not
to
sample
all
of
the
3f
offerings
big
thanks
goes
out
to
bobby91w
for
sending
this
one
my
way
as
an
extra
in
a
very
recent
trade
i
had
honestly
just
added
this
to
my
wants
list
thanks
again
man
served
from
bottle
into
a
three
floyds
xv
anniversary
imperial
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
earthy
hop
spices
and
floral
notes
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
earthy
hop
spices
floral
wheat
banana
fruit
and
subtle
bubble
gum
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
pretty
nice
and
inviting
it
was
really
well
balanced
and
was
fairly
good
for
the
saison
genre
the
flavor
was
fairly
good
but
it
was
a
little
more
toward
the
earthy
side
of
things
rather
than
being
really
well
balanced
like
the
aroma
this
was
unfortunate
but
didnt
kill
the
brew
overall
still
really
nicely
done
and
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
just
because
the
label
art
is
so
badass
easy
drinking
not
bad
but
nothing
spectacular
worth
a
seek
though
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
saison
another
winner
from
fff
for
me
the
nose
is
super
fruity
which
i
loved
and
the
taste
is
as
well
though
not
quite
as
much
easy
to
drink
would
certainly
have
it
again
p
s
hilarious
illustration
on
bottle
thought
this
was
just
a
tad
sweet
overall
worth
trying
though
i
suppose
o
im
always
happy
to
try
something
new
from
3f
but
this
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
dud
for
them
perhaps
the
style
is
just
not
their
forte
o
very
drinkable
and
nice
and
sweet
the
spiciness
is
a
nice
touch
to
the
end
not
to
blown
away
by
it
seems
somewhat
average
for
a
three
floyds
brew
saisons
arent
necessarily
my
thing
and
so
for
me
this
is
not
really
worth
the
price
bought
it
mostly
for
the
artwork
and
for
the
fact
that
its
made
by
three
floyds
and
i
have
never
passed
up
trying
one
of
their
beers
o
this
beer
is
a
good
as
it
is
strange
and
its
very
strange
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
had
and
definitely
worth
getting
will
be
back
next
year
for
this
odd
gem
this
is
another
interesting
and
well
made
offering
from
three
floyds
its
a
good
saison
and
i
was
pleased
that
3f
didnt
try
and
incorporate
hops
into
this
keeping
it
true
to
style
overall
impression
wow
close
to
5
out
of
5
from
fff
im
glad
that
stuck
true
to
style
on
this
one
will
be
patiently
waiting
the
release
of
this
in
2012
compared
to
their
other
reviews
this
beer
from
three
floyds
seems
to
be
something
of
a
redheaded
stepchild
its
a
wonderful
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
faint
tart
fruitiness
and
a
soft
acidity
but
it
costs
notably
more
than
some
better
saisons
like
ommegang
hennepin
still
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
andor
a
fan
of
the
brewer
like
me
you
owe
it
to
yourself
and
the
brewer
to
give
this
a
whirl
o
a
solid
saison
a
lot
going
on
much
like
other
3
floyds
beers
just
big
on
the
spice
notes
in
this
one
o
its
hard
to
knock
this
beer
its
not
quite
a
saison
from
my
experience
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
so
style
aside
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
again
o
a
really
nice
saison
highly
drinkable
one
of
the
better
americanmade
saisons
ive
had
in
a
while
o
pretty
nice
saison
didnt
exactly
taste
the
rock
candy
but
it
was
very
sugarysweet
so
that
might
have
been
its
manifestation
either
way
tasty
from
a
bomber
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
hazy
yellow
apricot
with
a
2
inch
white
that
shrinks
to
a
finger
with
nice
lacing
aromas
are
apricot
bread
pine
yeast
and
has
an
earthiness
to
it
taste
is
somewhat
nutty
with
mild
tropical
fruit
and
grapefruit
its
slightly
bready
and
has
a
bright
fruitiness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
kinda
frothy
i
like
this
saison
a
lot
o
a
standard
belgium
that
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
literally
if
you
want
a
rock
candy
infused
beer
this
has
alot
of
rock
candy
flavor
it
is
okay
i
guess
defiantly
a
goofy
beer
and
not
one
that
is
supposed
to
break
any
ground
body
is
medium
and
a
bit
chewy
with
a
spicy
coriander
finish
really
unbelievable
how
much
spice
is
in
this
one
potentially
my
least
favorite
fff
beer
ever
unfortunately
o
one
of
the
most
uncharacteristic
fff
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
thought
three
floyds
was
all
about
hops
in
every
style
they
attempt
this
however
showed
that
this
brewery
has
a
great
range
awesome
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
reviewing
without
bias
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
great
example
of
a
saison
3
floyds
can
take
any
style
of
beer
and
dominate
it
o
not
a
bad
saison
quite
spicy
as
mentioned
reminds
me
more
of
a
witbier
tastes
like
a
witbier
mixed
with
a
saison
i
think
pours
a
reddish
goldenorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
little
bit
of
floaties
in
there
too
scent
is
quite
interesting
initially
sweet
bready
and
herbal
a
bit
of
funk
and
wet
dog
aroma
also
get
sweet
apples
and
cinnamon
a
bit
of
orange
peel
as
well
taste
is
at
first
grainy
and
a
bit
musty
with
some
sweet
apple
flavor
subdued
hops
with
belgian
yeast
and
bready
malt
flavors
tons
of
herbs
and
spices
somewhat
winterlike
very
unique
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
no
alcohol
flavor
detected
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
was
one
great
beer
not
very
typical
for
the
average
saison
as
it
is
unlike
any
one
i
have
tasted
before
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
wish
i
had
access
to
purchasing
it
myself
o
a
fairly
average
saisonand
i
love
saisonsa
touch
fruity
grainy
and
musty
medium
body
nice
carbonation
a
little
creamy
pretty
smooth
on
the
tongue
pretty
solid
saison
which
seems
to
ride
the
line
between
sweet
and
funky
after
smelling
this
for
a
while
i
expected
more
funk
in
the
taste
instead
i
got
a
weird
cocktail
of
spices
and
other
flavors
that
worked
really
well
i
really
cant
compare
this
beer
to
anything
else
ive
ever
had
its
very
interesting
and
tasty
o
actually
had
a
little
too
much
flavor
versus
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
saison
its
a
more
powerful
and
interesting
take
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
in
the
more
traditional
vein
its
a
bit
of
a
let
down
good
beer
but
one
i
would
only
drink
occasionally
o
i
am
always
glad
to
try
a
brew
from
fff
i
enjoyed
this
but
wouldnt
put
it
in
rotation
o
i
thought
this
had
some
really
good
interesting
qualities
but
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
much
of
a
villian
here
for
my
liking
i
think
that
some
people
hard
alcohol
drinkers
would
be
really
intrigued
by
this
saison
but
i
found
it
to
be
frustrating
over
the
course
of
a
pint
i
was
getting
a
lot
of
interesting
notes
at
first
but
after
time
the
alcohol
just
seemed
to
make
the
flavor
window
smaller
and
smaller
i
found
myself
having
to
focus
on
what
comes
before
the
alcohol
as
i
would
lose
sensitivity
that
was
too
bad
but
when
this
is
good
its
good
this
would
go
very
well
with
a
full
belly
and
some
hearty
dark
greens
and
earthy
veggies
beet
salads
would
make
for
a
nice
subtly
sweet
contrast
o
definitely
a
more
interesting
saison
than
a
necessarily
good
or
delicious
one
id
be
really
curious
to
age
this
and
see
what
happens
as
there
seems
to
be
a
ton
going
on
here
and
losing
some
of
the
heat
might
do
a
lot
id
reccommend
giving
this
a
shot
but
i
cant
promise
much
in
terms
of
how
much
you
will
like
it
o
very
enjoyable
another
fantastic
brew
from
fffs
looking
forward
to
trying
next
years
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
that
finishes
nicely
pretty
good
saison
but
a
little
sweeter
than
the
best
ive
had
overall
o
quite
interesting
a
different
set
of
flavors
and
aromas
than
typically
found
in
a
saison
but
they
work
well
and
yield
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
me
hope
to
have
again
somewhere
down
the
road
o
not
the
most
belgianesque
saison
ive
had
its
a
bit
too
heavy
and
thick
to
be
highly
drinkable
the
spices
are
good
but
they
seem
to
overpower
everything
that
and
the
alcohol
it
packs
a
punch
worth
a
try
though
cheers
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
goes
good
with
the
107
degree
day
we
are
having
here
in
phoenix
do
enjoyed
it
lower
top
tier
saisons
ive
had
great
4th
of
july
weekend
beer
thanks
ptmcb
heres
one
where
i
feel
the
overall
ba
score
is
a
bit
low
this
is
a
really
nice
saison
crisp
fruity
sweet
and
refreshing
huh
wow
im
still
drinking
this
and
am
still
surprised
by
its
sheer
excellence
especially
as
it
warms
a
little
i
kind
of
picked
this
bottle
to
prove
to
myself
that
not
all
3fs
beers
are
incredible
as
i
figured
they
would
screw
up
a
saison
like
most
american
brewers
hennepin
and
le
merle
excepted
of
course
however
this
is
simply
the
best
american
saison
ive
ever
had
and
id
be
interested
to
hear
anyones
recommendations
of
their
top
american
saisons
too
o
im
not
sure
how
much
of
a
saison
this
really
is
but
i
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
anyway
the
pour
was
very
nice
very
cloudy
and
hazy
with
a
huge
billowing
head
of
white
coming
up
and
over
the
top
really
nice
carbonation
could
be
seen
streaming
up
toward
the
top
of
the
glass
and
a
light
bit
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
light
aroma
light
spice
bananas
and
light
grain
nothing
really
over
the
top
here
at
all
and
very
understated
the
taste
was
a
bit
bigger
grainy
with
a
light
fruit
hint
to
it
but
still
nothing
that
is
terribly
over
the
top
good
but
not
great
light
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
peach
and
pear
as
it
rolls
out
smooth
light
and
even
carbonation
and
a
nice
easy
to
drink
quality
to
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
had
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
o
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
saison
but
its
flavors
give
off
more
of
a
tripel
vibe
than
a
saison
it
was
ok
but
there
are
45
saisons
id
choose
over
it
the
cpj
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
saison
not
what
im
used
to
but
it
works
very
nice
effort
o
this
is
my
first
saison
and
i
liked
it
split
this
bottle
with
my
brother
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
it
good
times
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
straw
topped
by
a
healthy
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
lightly
funky
wheat
light
coriander
black
pepper
orange
zest
and
grass
the
taste
maintains
some
the
of
the
citrus
leaned
toward
in
the
smell
but
focuses
more
on
an
earthy
and
spicy
character
with
notes
of
clove
cardamom
nutmeg
light
balsa
heavy
wheat
and
honey
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
refreshing
finish
overall
a
very
nice
saison
one
of
the
few
i
wouldnt
mind
regularly
sipping
on
in
the
future
three
floyds
knows
their
stuff
and
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
poured
as
a
golden
orange
with
a
pretty
good
white
head
retention
spicy
banana
aroma
and
some
light
spices
tastes
like
a
mix
of
wheat
grains
banana
and
spice
the
aftertaste
and
complexity
non
existent
it
has
good
flavor
upfront
but
kinda
drops
off
the
map
after
the
swallow
this
brew
is
on
the
lighter
side
also
and
would
be
ideal
for
summer
drinking
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
three
floyds
but
this
one
will
take
a
back
burner
for
me
i
hope
to
find
it
on
tap
sometime
and
compare
to
the
bottle
variety
after
the
smell
the
best
part
of
this
one
was
the
label
this
is
not
the
best
saison
that
ive
had
nor
is
it
the
worst
i
think
fff
can
do
better
o
this
beer
hides
in
9
abv
quite
well
and
is
true
to
style
yet
another
good
beer
from
3f
but
seriously
how
about
a
date
code

they
played

pretty

a

americanized
i
e

as

as
saisons
go
this
one
is
pretty
basic
ive
never
been
particularly
impressed
with
any
of
the
belgian
offerings
from
three
floyds
the
one
is
somewhat
of
a
novelty
for
me
because
i
like
the
bottle
if
you
like
saisons
give
it
a
try
overall
the

well
hidden
but
it
kicks
up
the
peppery
phenols
a
bit
too
much
as
far
as
seasonals
go
this
isnt
necessarily
a
run
out
and
get
it
while
it
lasts
but
im
glad
to
have
at
least
one
a
year
very
disappointing
brew
from
three
floyds
it
just
wasnt
very
interesting
of
good
this
is
a
really
good
saison
and
its
refreshingly
not
loaded
with
chops
as
expected
from
three
floyds
id
say
its
a
pretty
traditional
saison
but
perhaps
without
the
same
body
as
one
from
france
or
belgium
overall
3
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
although
it
was
a
bit
different
that
many
saisons
ive
tried
previously
the
people
i
was
with
liked
it
more
than
i
did
though
please
send
me
a
beer
mail
if
you
find
rr
on
tap
around
chicago
this
was
the
first
craft
beer
that
woke
up
my
taste
buds
many
years
ago
straw
haze
in
color
a
slight
yeast
smell
taste
of
dry
fruits
at
9
i
found
out
why
they
called
it
rabid
rabbit
cute
and
fuzzy
but
packs
a
bite
it
is
a
spring
time
favorite
bottle
poured
into
de
dolle
tulip
hazy
apricot
orangish
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
all
yeast
cloves
earthy
some
orange
rind
taste
is
similar
peppery
and
sharp
yeast
some
peach
flavors
most
likely
from
amarillo
slightly
malty
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
heavy
carbonation
watery
feeling
in
the
finish
and
pretty
dry
an
ok
beer
with
some
interesting
flavors
but
far
from
my
favorite
saison
or
favorite
three
floyds
beer
drinkable
sure
a
couple
o
easy
to
finish
and
another
win
for
three
floyds
not
your
average
saison
check
this
one
out
if
youre
either
a
fan
of
the
style
or
a
fan
of
the
brewery
too
strong
to
have
another
one
of
but
a
bottle
split
between
two
people
seemed
perfect
overalldrinkability
i
didnt
finish
the
bomber
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
as
compared
to
others
of
this
style
3f
is
a
great
brewery
but
you
cant
be
good
at
everything
overall
pretty
good
when
i
think
of
saisons
i
think
of
really
nice
refreshing
beers
and
this
is
certainly
one
despite
being
9
abv
this
is
my
first
three
floyds
beer
and
will
definitely
not
be
my
last
d
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
all
around
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
is
great
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
9
abv
beers
out
there
and
one
that
is
light
enough
to
quench
my
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
of
a
cool
springfalll
night
d
very
high
in
terms
of
flavor
but
the
hidden
9
abv
might
be
a
bit
much
very
god
take
on
the
style
not
classic
but
a
good
interpretation
d
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
flawed
beers
ive
seen
from
fff
i
am
surprised
by
it
the
rr
pours
a
murky
tinged
gold
with
medium
consistency
and
a
quickly
dissipating
thin
white
head
its
definitely
got
some
funk
to
it
it
smells
yeasty
sweet
and
has
this
spicy
funkyness
to
it
the
flavor
echoes
the
aromas
the
spicy
funkiness
hits
you
after
the
sweet
yeast
flavors
and
is
in
between
pine
and
citrus
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
really
like
this
one
its
unique
yet
what
id
expect
from
the
style
i
recommend
it
drinks
easy
enough
the
abv
is
well
hidden
this
one
is
a
bit
different
nice
change
of
pace
not
really
a
go
to
saison
imo
i
come
to
expect
a
lot
from
fff
this
really
didnt
deliver
a
decent
beer
but
the
combo
of
it
being
relatively
high
alcohol
and
the
fact
its
not
a
favorite
of
mine
i
wouldnt
really
rank
it
that
high
d
one
of
the
weirdest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
and
the
sweetness
might
start
to
grate
on
me
after
a
while
but
this
brew
is
fantastic
i
had
had
this
one
last
year
and
forgotten
how
good
it
was
when
the
season
rolls
around
again
ill
definitely
trade
for
a
couple
more
of
these
or
get
my
family
in
the
midwest
to
pick
me
up
some
more
thanks
to
dan
for
bringing
this
one
by
the
other
night
pours
a
cloudy
yellowamber
with
a
minimal
amount
of
white
foam
aromas
of
brown
spices
black
pepper
and
belgian
yeast
flavors
of
candi
sugar
brown
spices
and
yeast
a
pretty
decent
effort
and
enjoyable
but
not
among
the
upper
tier
of
u
s
saisons
i
have
no
idea
what
inspired
the
name
of
this
beer
but
i
hope
to
find
out
someday
maybe
it
means
nothing
mabye
its
like
the
33
on
a
bottle
of
roling
rock
who
knows
if
the
name
is
a
bit
different
but
the
beer
is
bit
well
not
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
this
rabid
rabbit
tastes
a
bit
like
a
strong
eurolager
with
a
somewhat
unpleasant
phenolic
character
not
as
a
complex
as
i
remember
nor
as
tart
and
spicy
it
is
golden
to
amber
in
color
there
is
alcohol
and
some
decent
bitterness
i
suppose
but
overall
im
very
disapointed
with
this
beer
d
fairly
drinkable
this
is
a
unique
beer
i
know
that
pepper
and
saison
are
a
good
combo
this
might
be
just
a
little
too
peppery
very
easy
drinking
with
great
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
very
drinkable
solid
brew
may
have
held
on
to
this
bottle
a
bit
too
long
when
fresh
this
beer
is
hard
to
beat
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
it
has
medium
body
and
appropriate
medium
carbonation
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
chamomile
provides
the
depth
most
american
saisons
are
missing
from
their
belgian
farmhouse
counterparts
this
is
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
recommended
for
all
and
something
i
would
buy
again
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
on
the
moderate
side
drinkability
is
average
at
best
for
me
the
pepper
flavor
was
just
too
much
for
me
it
seemed
to
have
some
good
flavors
but
they
were
just
overshadowed
by
the
spice
not
one
of
my
favorite
fff
beers
overall
d
nice
summer
beer
to
drink
on
the
patio
on
a
hot
day
definitely
get
another
bomber
but
ill
be
a
little
more
careful
in
the
pour
as
theres
lots
of
sediment
in
this
beer
d
a
tasty
brew
when
you
consider
the
style
though
it
fits
but
in
a
twisted
or
bizarre
way
i
definitely
was
hoping
for
some
funk
but
this
is
a
much
more
fruit
and
spice
driven
one
not
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
3
floyds
has
better
offerings
d
reasonably
drinkable
the
high
abv
is
actually
well
hidden
i
never
would
have
guessed
9
abv
by
taste
alone
d
pretty
decent
saison
from
fff
i
think
they
had
their
own
take
on
the
style
and
made
it
a
little
bit
more
intresting
probably
not
one
of
my
favorite
from
3
floyds
the
beer
is
very
easy
drinking
for
being
9
but
not
all
that
refreshing
as
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
style
this
is
certainly
not
the
huge
boundarypushing
beer
that
id
expect
from
three
floyds
it
isnt
bad
but
it
doesnt
blow
my
mind
either
overall
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
saison
very
in
your
face
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
balance
d
goes
down
ok
milk
kick
nice
twist
of
the
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
have
though
the
corriander
was
a
bit
too
overwhelming
for
me
chad
have
to
admit
based
on
the
first
few
sips
i
really
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
slog
its
not
a
quick
drinker
but
over
the
course
of
a
bomber
to
myself
it
proved
to
be
very
enjoyable
now
im
not
going
to
put
it
up
there
with
fantome
and
saison
dupont
but
it
is
a
cool
stab
at
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
not
known
for
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
smallno
head
and
white
ring
the
smell
is
spice
and
fruitslight
clove
and
coriander
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
spice
and
clove
hit
first
then
some
fruit
and
corriander
maybe
some
pepper
and
lemon
or
citrus
peel
the
mout
feel
is
medium
and
this
brew
did
not
impress
me
for
the
style
it
was
just
average
fff
is
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
brewerys
this
style
is
not
there
forte
this
will
be
a
try
one
and
done
4
me
d
unfortunately
i
drank
this
on
the
same
night
i
had
saison
dupont
so
that
is
the
comparison
not
nearly
as
drinkable
or
smooth
and
the
flavors
are
good
but
dont
balance
quite
as
nicely
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
my
style
i
like
more
of
the
funky
earthy
saisons
than
this
type
of
spicy
too
much
imo
saison
medium
bodied
slick
feel
decent
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
9
0
abv
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
theres
none
of
the
alpha
king
wort
present
in
rr
as
this
is
a
pure
and
independent
interpretation
of
a
belgium
and
its
done
very
well
the
appearance
was
a
cloudy
deep
yellow
a
wonderful
bouquet
and
the
mouth
feel
had
a
bit
more
alcohol
content
than
i
remember
given
the
alcohol
content
it
was
a
bit
drier
than
my
recollection
but
it
only
forces
you
to
slow
down
and
savor
this
delicious
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
there
is
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
in
the
nose
or
taste
unique
tasting
saision
almost
like
a
blend
between
a
saison
and
wheat
ale
medium
bodied
tightly
effervesent
slightly
warming
in
the
throat
and
back
of
palate
some
resiny
aspect
to
the
aftertaste
is
the
only
knock
i
can
find
a
very
good
brew
indeed
glad
i
stopped
in
overall
i
think
this
is
just
too
sweet
for
a
saison
and
far
too
one
dimensional
for
my
liking
the
spice
one
dimensionality
and
real
lack
of
complexity
make
this
kind
of
a
dud
in
my
book
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
saison
style
but
not
to
its
benefit
drinkability
is
gooda
nice
refreshing
beer
for
one
of
the
first
warm
days
in
chicago
this
year
ovearll
ok
an
easy
to
drink
saison
d
a
nice
saison
three
floyds
style
which
differs
from
the
norm
i
really
like
this
one
and
when
its
ontap
at
the
brewpub
ill
usually
order
at
least
one
if
not
more
on
tap
at
fff
brewpub
in
tulip
straw
color
and
large
white
head
great
cake
like
smell
with
some
fruit
in
there
as
well
not
as
carbonated
as
bottle
conditioned
belgian
ales
esp
hennepin
but
that
didnt
detract
nice
yeasty
funk
and
overall
a
great
tasting
saison
never
noticed
the
9
had
to
buy
a
bottle
of
this
and
will
certainly
get
again
on
tap
served
in
a
tulip
glass
two
finger
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
great
yeast
smell
mild
fruity
mango
the
taste
is
nice
and
spicy
a
little
black
pepper
ginger
nice
and
sweet
overall
a
good
big
belgian
wheaty
saison
you
hardly
notice
that
9
abv
this
is
really
great
on
a
hot
afternoon
drinkability
easy
despite
the
9
abv
big
thanks
to
phaleslu
for
sending
me
this
one
which
has
been
on
the
wants
list
for
quite
some
time
it
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
pour
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
white
heading
it
smells
like
a
very
spice
heavy
version
of
this
style
i
get
some
ginger
orange
peel
brown
sugar
pie
crust
nutmeg
it
starts
off
kind
of
musty
in
the
taste
but
then
all
of
those
spices
come
rushing
in
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
too
body
is
pretty
thick
for
a
saison
at
first
i
did
not
really
care
for
this
beer
but
it
grew
on
me
as
time
went
on
this
beer
screams
american
interpretation
of
a
traditionally
belgian
style
one
of
the
more
interesting
saisons
i
have
run
in
to
in
a
while
cheers
d
not
as
drinkable
as
it
should
be
as
a
saison
too
heavy
but
a
good
offering
nonetheless
fffs
always
makes
solid
beer
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
sharing
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
allagash
goblet
poured
a
tawny
orangegold
with
a
murky
consistency
a
half
inch
creamy
white
head
dissipates
into
a
skim
revealing
delicate
bands
of
lacing
nose
is
very
spicy
and
herbal
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
chamomile
flavor
profile
is
a
spicy
muddle
of
chai
clove
nutmeg
pepper
and
a
little
mint
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
lively
effervescence
interesting
but
definitely
want
to
split
this
with
one
or
two
other
people
not
very
saisonlike
in
my
opinion
kind
of
reminded
me
of
sahtea
overall
a
weird
yet
pleasing
beer
not
bad
at
all
just
out
there
as
far
as
saisons
go
i
would
love
to
give
this
another
try
in
the
future
overall
id
say
it
was
pretty
drinkable
but
not
an
excellent
farmhouse
and
not
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
tf
drinkability
is
nice
theres
really
nothing
holding
it
back
at
all
tasty
fairly
straightforward
for
the
style
definitely
an
easy
to
drink
beer
i
gave
this
high
marks
in
the
taste
category
based
on
its
uniqueness
alone
but
in
reality
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
anyway
my
advice
seek
this
beer
out
and
enjoy
a
few
of
them
before
the
weather
turns
too
cool
i
like
this
one
a
lot
and
will
definately
seek
it
out
again
very
good
very
cool
very
tasty
smells
of
very
faint
ale
very
nice
creamy
head
presentation
is
cloudy
as
this
is
the
other
half
of
the
bomber
lacing
is
evident
and
taste
seems
to
decline
a
bit
being
much
more
smooth
less
carbonation
and
a
bit
more
detection
of
carbonation
i
would
prefer
this
in
a
tulip
glass
over
the
pint
glass
but
i
would
like
to
try
this
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
as
well
overall
id
probably
give
this
a
b
72100
first
off
i
love
the
label
once
again
great
artwork
from
3fs
golden
yellow
body
with
a
nice
initial
head
that
dissipated
to
nothing
this
beer
has
some
unique
smells
and
flavors
aromas
of
chamomile
cinnamon
roses
and
cotton
candy
tastes
of
lavender
nutmeg
more
chamomile
cranberry
and
white
pepper
lingering
flavors
but
some
light
dryness
a
pleasure
to
drink
unique
flavors
and
light
body
make
this
easy
to
drink
not
normal
is
definitely
right
pours
a
goldenamber
with
a
little
over
a
finger
of
head
in
my
25
oz
snifter
smell
is
orange
peel
rubber
cement
straw
dandelion
taste
is
a
huge
splash
of
ginger
seriously
like
chewing
on
a
gingerbread
cookie
some
light
tropical
fruit
notes
nuts
a
faint
hint
of
band
aid
medium
bodied
and
pretty
normal
for
the
style
honestly
i
am
having
a
tough
time
deciding
whether
i
like
this
or
not
the
ginger
spice
is
very
unique
and
interesting
but
it
kind
of
overshadows
everything
else
going
on
underneath
i
guess
in
the
end
i
would
have
to
recommend
this
simply
because
it
isnt
like
anything
ive
had
before
d
glad
i
got
to
try
and
split
this
beer
this
was
my
first
saison
beer
and
i
thought
i
would
be
pretty
safe
with
the
three
floyds
entry
and
maybe
i
was
rabbit
poured
a
cloudy
honey
color
with
a
respectable
head
that
didnt
last
here
i
will
lump
the
aroma
and
taste
together
there
is
a
brand
of
vegetarian
hot
dogs
out
there
that
smell
and
taste
just
like
rabbid
rabbit
needless
to
say
while
thats
not
bad
for
a
veggie
dog
its
not
what
i
expect
and
desire
in
a
beer
pumpkin
was
also
present
maybe
pumpkin
is
the
veggie
in
the
dog
too
feel
was
average
and
drinkability
just
above
it
was
only
ok
notes
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
offering
from
three
floyds
thus
far
i
am
a
fan
of
saisons
but
this
one
was
a
bit
too
off
the
mark
for
me
to
really
go
nuts
for
it
interesting
brew
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
that
ive
had
still
not
a
huge
appreciator
of
the
style
but
it
wasnt
bad
id
drink
this
again
two
thumbs
up
thanks
again
d0b
if
nothing
else
this
one
made
me
work
to
review
it
d
meh
not
really
the
cinnamon
taste
is
weird
for
a
beer
like
this
not
digging
it
spices
and
fruit
go
down
very
smooth
d
this
is
eerily
drinkable
for
the
9
abv
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
in
the
slightest
a
very
unique
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
any
beer
enthusiast
overall
a
different
kind
of
saison
and
very
tasty
drink
it
fresh
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
really
a
interesting
beer
all
around
from
the
color
to
the
smell
and
taste
stronger
abv
farmhouse
ale
beer
orange
hazy
color
with
small
white
head
very
sweet
complex
floral
flavor
with
definite
banana
taste
enjoyable
to
drink
in
the
spring
outside
overall
not
a
very
good
saison
probably
wont
trade
for
it
again
drinkability
well
that
was
certainly
a
bit
different
and
surprisingly
drinkable
worth
a
try
dont
drink
drive
orange
colored
body
with
a
thin
head
of
white
suds
that
fades
very
quickly
and
leaves
fine
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
perfumepotpourri
mascerated
peaches
and
allspice
tastes
of
roasted
pumpkincloves
and
funky
allspice
with
a
nice
hit
of
cinnamon
almost
more
like
a
pumpkinapple
spice
beer
than
a
saison
this
beer
reminds
me
of
patchouli
a
little
too
much
nice
spicy
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
slick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
fine
carbonation
not
my
favorite
fff
offering
a
pretty
easydrinking
saison
from
fff
maybe
i
should
have
picked
up
a
couple
more
this
is
the
first
saison
i
have
had
and
if
they
are
all
like
this
i
wont
have
many
more
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
saison
not
your
typical
saison
but
still
pretty
good
very
citrusy
and
fruity
and
very
delicious
i
am
beginning
to
like
this
style
alot
very
small
white
head
slightly
cloudy
well
carbonated
apricot
in
color
smells
sugary
flowery
like
brown
sugar
aromas
of
french
toast
cinnamon
tastes
like
french
toast
with
apricot
syrup
cardamom
medium
body
finish
is
custardy
cinnamony
apricots
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
not
ovepowering
would
definitely
buy
again
drinkability
is
good
nicely
done
3
floyds
this
is
a
interesting
and
complex
take
on
the
saison
style
it
might
not
be
all
that
true
to
style
but
i
like
it
and
id
happily
drink
this
one
again
drinkability
easily
the
worst
of
the
3fs
beers
ive
tried
thus
far
in
my
countdown
its
both
stylistically
inaccurate
and
just
overall
a
little
strange
dont
get
me
wrong
it
has
its
redeeming
qualities
and
the
alcohol
was
masterfully
hidden
for
its
size
id
recommend
toning
back
a
little
on
the
herbalfloralphenolic
notes
however
and
amping
up
the
yeast
action
get
some
fruity
flavors
and
some
carbonation
in
this
one
and
it
could
be
a
pretty
solid
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
into
my
duvel
tulip
almost
exactly
the
appearance
of
commercial
apple
juice
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
a
two
finger
head
is
just
reachable
with
multisize
bubbles
quickly
dissapearing
leaving
decent
chunks
of
lace
behind
smell
is
sweet
malt
and
biscuit
yeast
to
start
with
crisp
green
apple
concord
grape
and
a
fair
spicy
nose
taste
is
very
fruity
with
apple
and
grape
followed
by
cinnamon
and
other
spices
faint
barnyard
is
nearly
lost
under
all
the
sweet
fruit
and
spices
only
showing
themselves
after
the
beer
had
warmed
up
to
nearly
room
temperature
finish
is
very
dry
and
doesnt
linger
no
real
heat
surprising
for
nine
percent
medium
thick
mouth
is
a
pleasant
surprise
and
the
carbonation
massages
the
tongue
well
a
nice
beer
but
not
quite
the
saison
i
was
hoping
for
i
am
having
my
suspicions
about
the
age
of
this
bottle
one
of
the
more
disappointing
three
floyds
beers
i
doubt
i
will
purchase
this
one
again
take
your
time
with
it
rabbid
rabbits
complexities
arent
apparent
on
the
first
several
sips
neither
is
the
9
alcohol
i
wouldve
guessed
6
at
most
tons
of
depth
to
be
discovered
obviously
i
also
like
how
its
not
insanely
hoppy
as
one
might
expect
from
this
brewery
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
with
robert
the
bruce
gorch
fock
and
now
this
badass
rabbit
three
floyds
are
proving
theyre
not
just
a
onetrick
hopspony
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
2
fingered
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
and
sweet
with
a
very
pleasant
malt
base
to
it
this
is
proabbly
the
best
commercial
saison
i
have
tried
very
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
the
malt
and
the
spices
really
a
lovely
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
the
carbonation
level
seem
appropriate
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
wish
i
had
some
more
i
fear
i
may
have
aged
this
one
a
little
too
long
but
good
nonetheless
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
id
put
it
right
up
there
with
dupont
as
one
of
the
top
saisons
ive
had
its
completely
different
than
saison
dupont
but
wonderful
in
its
uniqueness
definitely
worth
a
try
if
it
werent
9
i
could
drink
it
all
day
ahh
three
floyds
you
crazy
bastards
this
one
is
a
home
run
d
im
not
a
fan
its
too
weird
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
yellow
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
quite
yeasty
and
fruity
in
the
taste
yeasty
fruity
and
nice
ginger
presence
a
smooth
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
yeasty
and
a
small
ginger
spice
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
yeastiness
and
nice
with
a
hint
of
ginger
di
will
be
more
than
happy
to
finish
this
one
off
but
not
one
of
3fs
best
drinkabilityconclusion
not
sure
why
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
one
and
im
equally
not
sure
why
this
only
is
rated
a
b
currently
on
ba
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
in
a
while
i
must
say
not
style
defining
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
very
very
solid
and
more
enjoyable
to
me
than
many
that
fit
perfectly
into
the
mold
and
after
all
its
not
normal
flavor
is
more
balanced
than
aroma
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
camomile
mingling
with
a
slightly
spicy
yeastiness
sweet
as
well
but
not
clying
good
carbonation
keeps
this
from
being
overbearing
but
i
dont
think
i
could
finish
a
whole
bomber
solo
hv
a
good
saison
as
interesting
as
the
style
seemingly
demands
marked
by
contrast
and
differences
in
both
mouthfeel
and
taste
creamy
but
crisp
smooth
but
spicy
tastes
of
orange
zest
and
coriander
and
some
freshly
milled
grain
and
grasses
a
slight
hint
of
band
aids
as
well
finishing
with
some
alcohol
warmth
poured
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
billowing
resilient
head
smells
of
chamomile
nutmeg
spices
spicey
zest
orange
chamomile
hops
define
most
of
the
taste
for
me
and
there
is
really
some
very
obvious
mint
it
is
a
smooth
drink
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
high
abv
is
not
obvious
overall
a
pleasant
and
interesting
take
on
the
saison
style
d
pretty
high
abv
for
a
saison
a
little
overpowering
on
the
spices
and
alcoholic
burn
in
your
throat
is
definitely
noticeable
tasty
yes
subtle
no
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
three
floyds
d
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
all
around
pretty
close
to
style
which
is
unusual
for
fff
as
well
it
is
impressivelt
thin
for
such
a
high
abv
beer
and
the
taste
is
even
stranger
than
the
aroma
it
seems
overspiced
and
the
coriander
orange
pepperiness
and
something
else
somewhat
sweet
that
i
cannot
identify
all
keep
mixing
but
not
very
well
it
is
definitely
unique
but
not
in
a
good
way
in
my
opinion
expensive
like
most
fff
but
unlike
others
not
really
worth
it
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
really
different
this
might
suit

oz

pours
a
solid
peachy
color
with
just
a
light
broken
film
over
top
clarity
is
very
good
and
just
a
few
stray
bubbles
are
making
their
way
to
the
surface
of
the
brew
there
is
not
as
much
carbonation
or
head
as
i
expected
to
see
on
this
one
the
first
big
inhale
brings
solid
sweetness
both
from
pilsner
malt
and
the
candied
sugar
with
orangey
zestyness
and
a
ild
chamomile
spiceyness
rounding
it
out
the
first
sip
brings
good
sweet
candied
chamomile
with
a
light
banana
and
orange
background
none
of
the
flavors
are
very
strong
and
everything
blends
well
ive
had
this
one
off
tap
a
while
back
and
i
recall
the
chamomile
really
popping
and
making
this
beer
shine
it
is
taking
a
back
seat
now
the
finish
is
a
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
pretty
weak
carbonation
i
really
would
like
to
see
this
one
with
a
nice
effervescenceto
make
it
feel
more
light
overall
this
one
is
tasty
and
overall
a
nice
drink
as
it
is
warming
the
chamomile
is
starting
to
pop
a
little
more
fiving
it
a
nice
spicey
almost
light
cinnamon
and
graham
character
i
know
there
is
variation
in
batches
but
this
one
just
seems
different
from
what
i
remember
it
being
this
one
is
a
monster
at
9
so
it
is
a
really
drinkable
brew
for
the
punch
it
has
its
not
necessarily
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
but
this
is
3fs
its
not
normal
drinkability
crisp
balanced
flavor
is
awesome
and
infinitely
drinkable
though
the
alcohol
militates
against
drinking
too
much
the
price
probably
means
i
wont
return
to
this
for
a
while
at
10
this
is
more
expensive
than
many
belgian
counterparts
and
twice
the
price
of
ommegangs
hennepin
nonetheless
a
great
golden
ale
that
will
please
fans
of
belgians
and
of
fff
a
good
brew
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
enjoy
the
hop
aggressiveness
for
the
style
a
little
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
expected
for
the
style
malt
dominates
the
flavor
profile
doughy
and
gently
candyish
its
rich
and
round
and
just
subtly
toasty
and
mildly
carameltinged
light
herbal
and
floral
spiciness
rounds
it
out
and
then
floats
about
the
mouth
in
the
finish
some
delicate
phenolics
lend
a
hand
to
its
candy
character
bitterness
is
kept
at
a
minimum
for
the
style
and
this
is
a
maltmonster
compared
to
most
of
the
saisons
coming
out
of
belgium
and
france
it
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
and
dryness
and
perhaps
even
balance
still
its
quite
enjoyable
as
it
is
and
surprisingly
drinkable
its
just
not

i
think
of

i
think
of

a
saison
it
has
a
medium
body
mildly
astringent
light
syrupy
texture
an
odd
one
for
sure
not
my
favorite
saison
by
any
means
but
one
thats
worth
trying
big
thanks
to
hero27
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
overall
i
enjoyed
this
i
will
try
on
tap
at
a
later
date
pours
a
rich
clear
copper
color
with
12
inch
of
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
rich
bready
smell
that
is
rather
vinous
with
a
light
gingery
spice
i
also
detect
somewhat
of
a
funky
tangy
aroma
the
taste
also
carries
a
light
spice
and
a
nice
malty
backbone
mildy
sweet
of
bread
and
citrus
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
sourness
and
just
a
small
touch
of
a
dms
like
flavor
not
bad
interesting
very
different
than
what
i
expect
from
a
saison
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
moderate
carbonation
present
unique
in
flavor
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
this
brew
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
an
easy
drinker
i
didnt
notice
until
after
i
was
almost
finished
that
its
actually
9
abv
so
perhaps
i
should
have
shared
this
bottle
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
soooo
surprisingly
smooth
and
warming
high
abv
on
this
one
and
its
sneaky
i
like
it
the
smell
was
kind
of
funky
in
a
good
way
and
included
the
3f
aroma
of
hops
the
taste
was
not
so
hoppy
more
biting
and
maybe
just
a
little
bitter
pretty
smooth
but
not
as
grassy
or
bubblegummy
as
belgian
saisons
ive
tried
but
a
pretty
good
saison
bottle
from
robertdoesbeer
poured
a
slightly
dark
yellow
color
ale
with
a
medium
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
spices
is
interesting
with
some
subtle
for
3f
anyway
citrus
hops
taste
is
a
bit
puzzling
with
a
nice
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
and
great
spice
mix
the
end
is
a
bit
too
dry
and
a
tad
too
hoppy
for
my
own
taste
body
is
way
too
thin
for
the
style
and
way
too
filtered
imo
even
though
it
is
an
interesting
beer
there
is
no
way
that
this
is
close
to
the
farmhouse
saison
style
being
brewed
in
belgium
this
beer
poured
a
bright
amber
color
its
topped
by
a
thin
off
white
head
and
has
just
a
bit
of
sediment
that
settles
quickly
into
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
nice
yeast
quality
bread
dough
a
bubblegum
quality
a
little
green
apple
and
mild
spice
the
flavor
has
an
almost
candy
quality
the
bubblegum
character
is
back
the
apple
reminds
me
of
a
jolly
rancher
spice
comes
through
pretty
quickly
there
is
some
white
pepper
a
little
cardamom
and
a
touch
of
citrus
orange
its
fascinating
to
drink
a
beer
from
3
floyds
that
doesnt
have
an
assertive
hop
character
the
mouth
feel
is
slightly
sticky
with
just
a
bit
of
heat
nice
beer
not
great
but
its
fun
to
have
something
different
from
3floyds
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
little
head
that
is
gone
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
spice
citrus
and
fruitiness
going
on
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
lots
of
spices
and
citrus
along
with
hints
of
fruit
and
it
seems
to
have
a
little
too
much
bitterness
id
have
preferred
this
one
with
a
little
less
hops
but
its
still
a
tasty
brew
d
it
was
hot
and
i
was
thirsty
generally
saisons
and
heat
go
really
well
together
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
dry
that
begins
the
self
perpetuating
cycle
of
drinking
a
saison
because
it
makes
you
thirsty
this
is
just
sweet
pours
a
a
golden
orange
color
quite
clear
minimal
white
head
maybe
half
inch
that
fades
quickly
no
lacing
is
left
behind
some
cloudy
sediment
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
big
bready
malt
smells
with
lots
of
spices
pepper
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
some
fruity
and
floral
aromas
sweet
malt
taste
bready
and
yeasty
some
fruit
flavors
show
up
maybe
banana
and
orange
peel
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
crispness
to
it
easy
too
drink
especially
during
the
summer
months
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
10
a
bomber
cheers
drinkability

this
was
a
pleasant
easy
drinker
that
went
down
well
it
was
offstyle
but
adequate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
the
lighter
side
with
good
steady
bubbles
quite
refreshing
with
no
sign
of
the
slightly
high
abv
to
be
found
a
good
summer
brew
that
ill
enjoy
on
the
beach
when
im
camping
in
july
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
saison
that
ends
up
being
quite
enjoyable
however
the
price
point
pushes
down
the
drinkability
on
this
one
for
me
personally
if
it
was
more
around
5
a
bomber
id
be
drinkin
it
all
summer
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
in
the
glass
aromas
of
flowers
and
spice
spicy
yeast
honey
and
hay
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
good
drinkability
for
the
7
4
alcohol
and
that
is
about
it
9
bucks
a
bottle
i
just
dont
get
it
d
goes
down
very
easily
might
be
a
bit
filling
and
the
9
00
abv
may
catch
up
with
you
after
a
while
but
if
you
can
put
that
aside
youll
be
throwing
this
beer
back
for
a
long
time
this
is
yet
another
excellent
beer
from
three
floyds
i
wasnt
too
thrilled
with
the
saison
style
but
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
the
others
that
ive
had
cheers
beertracker
perhaps
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
due
to
three
floyds
patented
excess
but
a
noble
effort
at
a
style
applauseworthy
lots
of
saison
styles
out
now
this
is
the
best
one
received
from
orbitalr0x
as
part
of
bif
33
this
22
oz
bomber
had
a
humorous
label
of
rabbit
attacking
a
gnome
when
poured
this
one
came
out
a
hazy
golden
color
which
was
a
little
deeper
than
typical
it
was
also
undercarbonated
compared
to
other
examples
of
this
style
aromatically
it
was
a
little
too
clean
which
may
have
been
due
to
me
over
chilling
it
i
could
detect
floral
hops
and
green
apple
which
must
be
the
chamomile
but
none
of
the
funk
and
spiciness
that
is
typical
of
farmhouse
ale
the
taste
was
dominated
by
hops
and
chamomile
with
some
unfermented
candy
sugar
still
evident
the
warmer
the
beer
got
the
stronger
the
chamomile
taste
and
smell
became
like
avery
12
which
has
lavender
the
flowers
gave
this
a
one
dimensional
quality
but
unlike
the
12
this
was
an
agreeable
one
dimensionality
i
much
prefer
the
funky
yeasty
saisons
over
these
floral
varieties
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
thick
which
was
more
in
line
with
a
trippel
than
a
saison
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
aftertaste
was
grainy
sweet
it
was
quite
drinkable
considering
the
fact
that
i
dont
particularly
care
about
chewing
on
flowers
i
think
if
3fs
said
they
were
making
a
strong
belgian
ale
in
the
spirit
of
duvel
i
would
have
had
a
very
different
approach
to
this
beer
the
profile
of
it
fits
much
better
with
that
style
i
liked
rabbid
rabbit
but
i
really
would
not
call
it
a
saison
amberorange
in
color
with
a
nice
active
white
head
the
smell
is
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
with
lots
of
sweet
sugars
and
malts
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
a
combination
of
hops
and
spices
that
leave
a
slightly
herbal
finish
mouthfeel
is
slightly
sticky
but
balanced
in
the
carbonation
department
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
the
floyds
drinkabilty
this
goes
down
easy
but
it
does
not
entirely
taste
like
a
saison
like
many
3fs
it
claims
to
be
a
certain
style
but
actually
sort
of
does
its
own
thing
a
good
thing
usually
certainly
a
distinctly
3f
thing
and
this
is
really
good
just
not
entirely
a
saison
high
and
well
hidden
abv
limit
it
to
just
one
bomber
per
session
quality
brew
to
be
expected
from
three
floyds
the
color
is
stuck
somewhere
between
copper
and
orange
with
a
light
haze
and
a
mysterious
glow
the
aromas
of
bruised
fruits
spices
and
must
the
taste
confirms
the
aromas
heavy
flavors
of
peaches
pears
oranges
apricots
mangos
and
papayas
all
of
the
overrippened
variety
with
a
light
pepery
spiciness
lovely
medium
texture
creamy
and
smooth
softens
a
bit
in
the
finish
for
easy
drinking
the
beer
did
have
a
dish
soap
flavor
that
began
midway
through
the
sip
and
lingered
into
the
aftertaste
which
was
a
mild
deterant
i
also
prefer
a
less
rich
fruitiness
but
prefer
a
lighter
refresher
juicy
saison
i
also
prefer
a
bit
more
woodsy
musty
and
earthy
flavor
in
the
style
nevertheless
i
do
recommend
the
brew
thanks
kmpitz2
for
the
find
on
the
road
22
ounce
bottle
thanks
afatty
for
picking
up
this
scary
green
elf
eating
thing
for
me
d
this
beer
has
lots
of
nice
complex
flavors
that
disguise
one
another
very
nicely
the
flavors
are
hard
to
pull
apart
but
all
work
together
and
the
hops
are
big
but
appropriate
to
the
beer
no
big
pine
flavor
or
grapefruit
flavor
in
the
hops
o
solid
saison
i
like
some
of
the
classics
like
dupont
better
this
wasnt
quite
as
clean
and
crisp
as
dupont
but
still
good
i
reviewd
this
almost
a
year
ago
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
thought
it
was
better
dont
know
if
theres
any
difference
now
that
theyre
bottling
it
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
mouthfeel
is
warming
with
spices
and
pepper
jumping
around
the
body
is
moderate
not
too
sticky
fairly
dry
and
spicy
in
the
finish
not
too
bitter
since
the
hops
are
subtle
yet
aggressive
drinkability
is
good
though
as
ive
already
stated
its
no
match
for
gumballhead
in
that
department
i
wish
i
had
more
im
not
a
huge
saison
fan
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
spices
and
fruits
blend
together
really
well
and
the
soft
malts
round
this
out
a
bit
to
make
for
a
very
sweet
offering
from
a
brewery
typically
known
for
its
extreme
use
of
hops
for
9
its
amazing
how
every
sip
still
feels
very
crisp
refreshing
without
being
heavy
at
all
certainly
very
different
from
every
other
three
floyds
brew
ive
had
to
date
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
absolutely
worth
a
try
very
particular
yeast
flavor
complex
fruit
flavors
of
the
tropical
variety
some
peach
banana
malt
and
a
nice
blend
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
bitter
and
sharp
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
the
finish
is
slightly
off
a
good
saison
but
not
the
best
thanks
to
bbb63
from
the
other
site
at
the
kuhnhenn
gathering
on
610
from
the
bottle
poured
a
golden
brown
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
spicey
orange
cloves
ginger
coriander
and
hints
of
floral
flavor
a
nicce
blend
of
cinnamon
gloves
ginger
and
orange
peel
and
touch
of
malts
come
out
at
the
end
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
good
beer
hazy
gold
color
medium
head
for
a
9
abv
aroma
is
delicate
by
saison
standards
and
suggests
cloves
ginger
milder
yeast
somewhere
between
earthy
and
bready
and
floral
hops
no
hint
of
alcoholic
aroma
malts
are
blended
with
fruity
esters
and
seem
slightly
sweet
amarillo
hops
are
floral
and
offer
no
bitterness
maybe
the
best
presentation
of
delicate
hop
flavors
that
i
have
yet
encountered
smooth
taste
that
is
light
and
refreshing
to
fit
the
summer
season
but
this
is
not
your
simple
summer
thirst
quencher
complex
spices
and
hop
flavors
open
up
with
warmth
pleasant
diacetyl
taste
adds
to
a
full
and
round
mouthfeel
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
i
heard
described
as
honey
and
bread
no
bitterness
the
alcohol
may
dry
the
mouth
a
little
but
stayed
hidden
as
you
finally
sense
the
abv
by
effect
not
taste
most
drinkable
i
found
the
drinkability
so
good
i
had
trouble
saving
a
glass
in
the
growler
for
my
best
freind
draft
served
by
nick
floyd
how
this
is
even
better
than
when
they
had
it
last
year
great
coriander
citrus
spiciness
light
spicing
my
aunt
fanny
even
a
suggestion
of
cinnamon
layered
on
a
good
caramel
malt
base
its
better
than
that
actually
but
all
the
adjectives
i
want
to
use
are
already
on
their
own
description
a
burly
drink
a
lawnmower
beer
only
if
youve
been
mowing
golf
greens
for
8
hours
anyway
i
did
get
a
strong
taste
of
apple
crisp
it
was
very
comfortable
and
inviting
something
i
could
drink
often
with
a
chicken
dish
thanks
floyds
and
most
of
all
thanks
to
cretemixer
for
the
growler
ng
served
on
tap
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
lavender
and
chamomile
dominate
the
aroma
some
floral
spiciness
linger
in
the
background
from
the
hops
the
body
is
full
and
very
flavorfull
definately
something
different
to
drink
if
you
have
not
had
a
saison
before
tasted
at
the
2003
oregon
brewers
fest
medium
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
a
touch
barnyard
leather
and
must
a
medium
bodied
saison
malts
are
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
hops
are
floral
smooth
taste
light
and
refreshing
very
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
very
good
beer
wonderful
aroma
of
belgian
yeastbanana
with
the
same
initial
taste
initial
impressions
are
misleading
however
as
the
taste
was
dominated
by
hops
with
a
spicy
kick
nice
alcohol
warmth
in
the
end
excellent
ambergold
color
with
a
nice
white
head
good
retention
very
spicy
aroma
the
coriander
really
comes
through
with
undertones
of
citrusy
orange
good
flavor
spicy
yeasty
and
smooth
taste
of
alcohol
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
lightly
zesty
mouthfeel
with
the
continual
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
brew
not
really
my
favorite
style
so
hopefully
my
review
isnt
skewed
if
someone
gave
this
to
me
early
in
the
afternoon
or
as
a
substitute
for
champagne
i
would
happily
drink
it
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
any
more
for
myself
deep
tangerine
hue
very
little
head
clearer
than
i
thought
it
would
be
good
looking
maybe
expecting
something
a
little
bit
more
rustic
and
cloudy
hints
of
overripe
citrus
and
stonefruit
slightly
bready
character
peppery
yeast
notes
summing
the
aromas
up
overarching
peppery
yeast
notes
on
the
taste
subtle
peach
and
apricot
are
really
quite
pleasant
slight
metallic
taste
on
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
minor
lingering
flavors
the
metallic
finish
too
unfortunately
still
wanted
that
next
sip
enjoying
prairies
simple
clean
takes
on
classic
styles
very
good
brew
might
not
need
to
buy
this
one
again
but
growing
increasingly
impressed
with
paa
m
to
me
very
creamy
at
first
it
was
cumbersome
but
as
i
settle
in
it
seems
about
right
and
is
enjoyable
on
the
palate
beautiful
hazy
honey
color
a
complex
nose
that
i
cant
really
explain
slightly
fruity
but
with
a
vague
almost
peppery
smell
the
taste
is
solid
but
i
wish
the
nose
come
out
more
in
the
taste
the
body
is
light
and
make
this
an
intriguing
and
very
drinkable
beer
interesting
mix
of
spicy
and
fruity
yeast
tones
with
a
ton
of
flavor
for
such
a
low
end
abv
the
body
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
considering
the
very
big
saison
type
flavors
but
in
the
end
it
is
still
rather
solid
3
485
00
prairie
birra
35
overall
its
not
the
best
prairie
beer
i
have
had
but
its
still
decent
i
think
the
reviews
are
a
little
bit
low
its
better
than
an
85
to
me
o
a
decent
option
for
a
lowabv
nonfunkfest
saison
though
actually
closer
to
a
hefe

really
not
a

going
on
past
green

o
good
brew
my
first
from
oklahoma
i
got
it
on
wishbeer
in
bangkok
drank
it
in
kunming
serving
type

pours
hazycloudy
golden
yellow
with
enough
sediment
or
yeast
to
dirty
up
the
color
a
bit
soft
matte

white
head
of
foam
that
fell
fast
but
left
spots
of

as
i
drank
nose

light

and
a
slight

too

is

very
juicy
and
very
fruity
tart
lemon
peel

combine
for
a
bright
earthiness
light
sweet
multigrain
cracker
a
drizzle
of
honey
active

and
medium

spice
and
peppery
herbal
finish
this
one
with
a
lovely
bitterness
that
seems
tailor
made
to
bring
out
that
cool
and
vivid
herbal
light
overall
tartness
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
warmed
it
drank
flatter
though
odd
funk
to
the
smell
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
sipper
for
a
cool
spring
evening
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
inviting
i
like
the
emphasis
on
flavor
over
alcohol
content
this
is
my
first
beer
from
prairie
artisan
ales
i
have
one
of
their
collaboration
sours
in
my
cellar
as
well
that
i
probably
wont
wait
to
drink
for
a
beer
which
is
attempting
to
hold
something
back
this
beer
is
a
revelation
while
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
have
with
food
the
really
special
thing
about
it
is
the
nose
which
displays
an
ethereal
funky
barnyard
which
is
so
restrained
but
omnipresent
that
it
just
delights
wow
it
just
shows
the
prowess
of
these
guys
even
when
throttling
back
they
can
deliver
something
special
d
i
would
love
to
work
this
into
my
summer
rotation
in
place
of
a
german
pils
packs
a
huge
flavor
punch
at
4
2
a
solid
well
made
beer
very
heady
throughout
the
session
the
beers
color
is
pale
sunlight
with
bubbles
running
through
the
body
it
smells
like
a
saison
with
vague
spices
bubblegum
mint
and
a
note
of
manure
like
youre
wandering
around
a
barnyard
the
beer
has
a
spicy
grassy
flavor
overall
not
only
that
but
it
brings
some
tartness
to
the
palate
as
well
its
light
airy
easy
drinking
and
was
an
excellent
drink
to
go
with
dinner
o
i
understand
having
a
more
approachable
offering
to
give
to
those
who
arent
familiar
with
craft
but
i
feel
prairies
saisons
are
approachable
enough
as
it
is
this
one
can
pretty
much
be
thrown
in
with
a
lot
of
other
mediocre
belgians
that
are
on
the
market
it
tastes
fine
but
is
definitely
the
least
enjoyable
ive
had
thus
far
from
this
otherwise
stellar
brewery
this
was
my
first
prairie
beer
after
obviously
hearing
quite
a
lot
of
great
things
about
them
to
be
honest
i
really
dont
care
for
it
hop
bitterness
and
peppery
saison
yeast
is
about
all
im
getting
unfortunately
not
smelling
or
tasting
any
of
the
citrus
or
fruit
that
some
have
noted
not
terrible
but
just
not
something
i
would
buy
again
great
saison
beer
electrifies
the
taste
buds
pours
a
dull
weathered
gold
color
with
a
tight
head
of
white
froth
peppery
floral
soapiness
buttery
white
wine
biscuits
and
crisp
apples
in
the
nose
citrus
and
apples
prominent
spicy
yeast
hay
and
crackerlike
grains
fresh
floral
and
fruity
sweet
fairly
crisp
medium
bodied
lingering
dryness
the
yeast
is
talking
a
little
too
loud
in
this
one
overall
good
but
probably
wont
go
back
to
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
surprising
in
some
respects
exhilarating
flavor
leaving
your
tongue
tingling
and
craving
more
perfect
balance
of
fruity
nodes
and
bitter
hope
can
spend
a
day
in
the
sun
with
this
well
crafted
beverage
only
complaint
is
abv
not
much
risk
with
that
being
said
this
is
a
beer
i
would
definitely
reach
for
again
and
again
color
looks
like
an
unfiltered
beer
or
almost
even
a
mead
quite
an
interesting
bite
to
it
slightly
tangy
overall
good
beer
from
oklahoma
overall
cant
think
of
anything
bad
to
say
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
for
the
alcohol
level
there
is
a
great
amount
of
flavor
and
body
straw
to
golden
in
color
with
considerable
cloudiness
a
half
inch
of
dense
off
white
foam
is
present
brussels
lacing
i
smell
a
hint
of
lemona
touch
of
grassy
flavor
and
pale
malt
the
taste
is
lemon
and
then
a
blend
of
a
grassy
flavor
and
pale
malt
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
heavily
carbonated
i
love
prairie
beers
this
one
is
well
made
light
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
grassy
notes
overall
this
beer
to
me
is
only
ok
doesnt
stand
out
like
some
of
their
bombs
just
not
my
particular
favorite
but
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
a
pretty
tasty
homegrown
saison
very
fresh
and
emulating
of
the
oldworld
goodies
the
extra
hoppiness
and
lower
alcohol
goes
a
long
way
towards
this
ones
drinkability
which
i
would
imagine
being
improved
further
by
a
sunny
patio
or
harvest
moon
anyways
whats
with
the
italian
spelling
of
beer
in
the
name
here
cloudy
yellow
color
smells
of
an
average
saison
tastes
almost
like
budweiser
absolutely
nothing
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
medium
carbonation
not
sure
why
this
is
rated
so
low
for
a
straightforward
4
2
saison
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
flavor
its
not
funky
but
this
is
a
very
solid
sessionable
saison
o
ok
best
4
2
beer
i
have
ever
had
full
of
flavor
great
saison
very
well
done
didnt
like
it
at
all
the
feel
is
good
maybe
not
as
dry
and
soft
as
id
like
in
a
saison
but
with
a
firm
crispness
and
pretty
smooth
in
a
lightmedium
body
o
a
great
looking
beer
but
creamer
and
sweater
than
i
typically
like
my
saisons
light
bodied
crisp
well
carbonated
ale
this
drinks
like
more
of
an
import
saison
than
american
version
as
many
tasters
agree
well
crafted
beer
and
certainly
worth
the
try
12

that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
around

a
fair

saison
style
all
around
great
balance
robustness
and
complexity
of
fruityspicy
yeast
earthy
hops
and
pale

flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
a
very
traditional
interpretation
of
the
style
very
reminiscent
of
saison
dupont
i
think
i
like
the
americanized
versions
of
this
style
a
little
better
but
this
is
a
terrific
beer
for
fans
of
saisons
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
light
drinkable
saison
pretty
typical
for
the
style
the
only
miss
for
me
is
in
the
carbonation
this
is
my
first
brew
from
prairie
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
overall
heard
a
lot
about
these
guys
looking
forward
to
more
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
3
finger
width
foamy
head
high
carbonation
head
retention
is
excellent
lacing
is
very
good
slightly
sour
farmhouse
ale
aroma
yeasty
and
slightly
fruity
yeasty
up
front
with
fruitiness
in
the
back
taste
of
cloves
with
high
carbonation
good
beer
but
not
one
of
their
better
beers
or
farmhouse
ales
overall
fairly
decent
its
low
abv
and
relatively
easy
drinking
qualities
were
its
best
attributes
o
big
fan
new
to
prairie
aa
they
seem
to
know
what
theyre
doing
o
a
very
solid
and
easy
to
drink
saison
a
good
american
version
of
a
belgian
style
solid
and
refreshing
overall
4
so
far
everything
that
prairie
brews
is
off
the
chain
this
is
a
delicious
farmhouse
ale
and
id
love
to
have
this
again
delish
great
fruity
earthy
peppery
funky
farmhouse
ale
o
i
drank
this
with
some
fairly
spicy
texmex
food
and
it
was
a
great
beer
to
complement
that
the
hop
bitterness
accentuates
the
flavors
while
the
carbonation
really
washes
it
away
strong
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
flavors
but
mild
enough
to
refresh
between
bites
a
really
really
good
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
gold
with
a
bone
white
head
smells
fruity
with
bready
and
honeyed
malts
i
also
get
some
spice
and
belgianish
yeast
flavor
is
of
bready
malts
i
get
some
spicy
belgian
yeast
lots
of
clove
very
dry
lightly
tart
aftertaste
is
big
on
yeasty
slow
dough
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
this
is
awesome
hazy
straw
yellow
body
with
a
thick
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
grass
hay
floral
notes
tart
citrus
flavor
with
a
touch
of
lemon
rind
mild
bitterness
light
bodied
and
refreshing
solid
o
a
nice
sessionable
saison
that
packs
plenty
of
flavor
to
boot
attractive
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
nice
funky
farmhouse
aroma
but
a
nice
starting
flavor
leads
to
an
odd
lingering
grassiness
overall
a
little
disappointing
about
the
driest
beer
ive
had
pushing
painfully
so
o
another
enjoyable
brew
from
prairie
and
worth
seeking
out
light
body
carbonation
is
a
little
high
tart
and
crisp
a
building
herbal
hop
bitterness
lingers
into
the
dry
aftertaste
earthy
bitter
herbs
and
tart
underripe
green
stone
fruit
light
and
spritzy
with
a
signature
rustic
quality
missing
from
so
many
domestic
saisons
simplicity
is
underrated
and
this
is
a
fine
example
of
how
good
something
simple
can
be
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
understated
for
my
taste
solid
o
branded
to
be
sessionable
as
per
the
label
but
the
extremely
high
carbonation
takes
away
from
that
a
bit
making
it
a
sipper
overall
a
very
good
saison
o
outstanding
incredibly
drinkable
but
with
depth
great
offering
from
prairie
thumbs
up
oklahoma
to
style
but
superbly
well
made
and
controlled
tasty
balanced
fresh
this
is
an
outstanding
saison
across
the
board
its
light
and
easy
drinking
low
abv
and
full
of
flavor
it
doesnt
feature
huge
wild
notes
nor
unrestrained
sweetness
that
many
saisons
focus
on
rather
its
fairly
straightforward
and
delicious
lack
of
flavor
prairies
worst
offering
for
me
this
far
i
think
im
just
bitter
that
i
will
never
get
another
standard
which
was
one
if
my
favorite
offerings
from
prairie
if
i
wouldnt
have
heard
that
birra
was
replacing
it
i
prob
wouldnt
have
been
so
hard
on
this
beer
3
75
d
this
is
a
real
good
easy
drinking
farmhouse
with
all
the
boxes
of
the
style
ticked
off
added
bonus
of
a
lower
abv
which
is
nice
in
the
hotter
weather
overall
really
great
farmhouse
ale
nothing
mindblowing
but
refreshingly
simple
and
wellexecuted
if
i
was
a
farmer
in
oklahoma
or
belgium
for
that
matter
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
every
afternoon
after
working
the
fields
or
whatever
it
is
farmers
do
lemongrass
with
a
tad
of
peppercorn
in
the
nose
citrus
wheat
hay
and
of
course
caramels
as
is
expected
of
most
ales
milder
hops
presence
and
quite
a
thin
finish
a
nice
beer
fr
one
of
my
fav
breweries
but
def
not
one
of
the
best
brews
from
this
brewery
i
remain
a
strong
fan
and
dedicated
just
sad
this
beer
isnt
the
star
im
used
to
from
prairie
total
3650
this
batch
is
like
an
american
orval
not
bad
at
all
just
not
as
well
made
and
all
around
great
as
standard
basically
just
mild
esters
and
mild
funk
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
but
not
close
to
one
of
prairies
better
saisons
o
quite
tasty
a
nicely
done
saison
in
a
12
oz
container
an
enjoyable
easy
drink
recommended
o
very
solid
no
frills
saison
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
saisonfarmhouse
ales
i
love
the
size
and
design
of
the
bottle
too
its
such
a
great
flavor
but
not
overpowering
like
many
farmhouse
ales
its
smooth
and
light
yet
very
flavorful
its
a
bit
of
splurge
but
its
worth
having
the
artwork
is
always
a
pleasure
coming
from
prairie
ale
pours
a
hazy
light

nice
low
abv
saison
but
prairie
has
several
better
ones
this
is
another
take
on
the
saisonfarmhouse
ale
it
is
my
opnion
not
as
good
as
their
other
variations
while
it
does
have
its
moments
i
have
found
it
to
be
a
little
bitter
at
times
and
a
bit
to
hoppy
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
a
slight
more
touch
of
citrus
this
is
a
tasty
and
even
delicate
farmhouse
style
of
brew
that
is
totally
drinkable
from
the
12

overall
this
was
a
decent
saison
o
one
of
the
most
versatile
beers
ive
come
across
in
a
long
while
its
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
perfectly
complex
enough
to
pair
with
some
mild
cheese
or
a
nice
meal
another
winner
from
prairie
a
brewery
that
is
quickly
climbing
to
the
top
of
my
favorites
list
cheers
overall
its
just
so
impressive
and
nearly
perfect
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
the
saisons
these
guys
make
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
offering
hit
the
mark
on
the
style
dead
on
imo
much
more
juicy
and
less
dry
than
some
traditional
saisonfarmhouse
ales
however
the
zest
kick
still
gives
it
the
crisp
dry
characteristics
brilliant
i
would
buy
again
and
again
in
the
future
given
the
opportunity
very
good
easy
to
drink
if
it
were
a
higher
abv
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
of
it
from
the
reviews
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
so
tasty
and
refreshing
i
think
well
see
more
of
these
what
they
call
a
belgian
table
beer
sessionable
and
refreshing
this
will
be
great
with
the
oncoming
hot
socal
weather

that
this
is
just
my
kind
of
beer
a
light
wellconstructed
saison
with
plenty
of
character
and
no
trouble
going
down
its
dynamic
too
showing
different
aspects
at
different
times
depending
on
vessel
and
temperature
generally
speaking
its
just
an
excellent
table
or
almosttable
saison
thats
absurdly
easy
and
pleasing
to
drink
go
getcha
some
ya
weirdos
o
a
tasty
beer
but
im
not
all
too
experienced
with
saisons
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
o
could
drink
this
alll
day
if
this
was
more
availalble
in
ca
i
would
pick
it
up
regularly
as
a
daily
drinker
great
balanced
flavor
and
aroma
for
such
a
low
alcohol
package
prairies
saisons
always
impress
the
pour
is
muuurky
wheaty
golden
with
lots
of
lacing
and
head
big
wheaty
oats
saison
aroma
some
slight
hop
and
citrus
flavor
of
wheaty
malty
oats
citrus
saison
overall
rustic
quality
just
so
good
its
dry
flavorful
rustic
amazing
love
this
and
want
more
overall
i
am
not
big
on
the
style
but
i
like
this
one
overall
i
payed
3
99
for
this
prairie
beer
at
a
local
craft
pubbottleshop
i
cannot
complain
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
good
i
love
prairie
beers
and
this
one
was
a
steal
for
that
price
cheers
pours
to
a
frothy
bubbly
white
head
and
dirty
gold
color
aroma
is
peppery
clovey
and
fruity
with
a
sourgrainy
note
as
well
flavor
is
very
much
in
the
farmhouse
style
with
lemons
bananas
white
pepper
clove
and
other
spices
mixed
with
soft
sweet
grains
to
make
it
a
perfect
balance
mouthfeel
is
slightly
puckering
due
to
funky
yeast
which
is
a
good
thing
made
by
people
who
care
about
the
funk
damn
good
call
overall
a
decent
offering
but
like
so
many
beers
i
come
across
with
sub5
abv
this
one
just
leaves
me
a
bit
wanting
not
prairies
strongest
offering
but
still
much
better
than
many
of
the
saisons
that
seem
to
be
out
there
these
days
this
is
a
super
solid
all
day
drinker
but
its
114pack
worthy
of
a
try
thanks
chris
for
the
recommendation
o
basic
and
solid
easy
drinking
and
good
with
food
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
wheat
slight
citrus
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
wheat
pale
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hops
slight
alcohol
and
hint
of
grass
overall
decent
appearance
aroma
and
body
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spice
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
tart
grain
yeast
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
crisp
on
this
one
overall
decent
session
farmhouse
style
beer
the
balance
of
brett
and
bitterness
is
slightly
astringent
but
it
is
pretty
interesting
for
the
low
abv
this
may
not
be
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
but
its
light
and
fun
an
well
worth
a
try
overall
a
quality
farmhouse
ale
that
is
a
good
everyday
beer
this
beer
is
spicy
grainy
and
a
little
fruity
providing
the
right
level
of
complexity
in
an
easy
drinking
package
t
to
be
honest
there
just
really
isnt
that
much
going
on
here
a
kind
of
dull
graininess
throughout
with
a
touch
of
lemon
hay
and
light
barnyard
finish
shows
a
light
breadiness
and
maybe
a
touch
of
grapefruit
and
spice
a
fairly
laidback
farmhouse
ale
the
taste
and
aroma
were
pretty
subtle
i
still
enjoyed
it
flavor
follows
the
nose
and
is
nothing
amazing
but
its
still
well
crafted
notes
of
bread
freshly
backed
baguette
and
notes
of
sourdough
nice
earthy
mild
funk
that
compliments
the
grain
very
drinkable
with
a
crisp
clean
carbonation
great
for
spring
days
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
another
well
crafted
beer
from
prairie
almost
like
a
cross
between
belgian
wit
low
abv
saison
and
berliner
recommended
simple
and
sublime
and
never
uninteresting
i
think
ive
found
my
new
favorite
session
beer
birra
is
a
cross
between
a
classic
saison
type
and
a
hefe
a
big
fruity
robust
unfiltered
wheat
designed
for
all
day
drinking
instead
of
banana
though
the
most
evident
fruit
is
lemon
a
beautiful
hop
profile
as
citrusy
as
ive
seen
in
a
wheat
beer
lots
of
sediment
in
the
pale
hazy
beer
some
chunks
and
some
haze
two
inches
of
heavy
off
white
head
fresh
cereal
grains
and
the
lemon
zest
comprise
the
aroma
with
not
too
much
yeast
to
speak
of
but
the
flavor
brings
a
lot
of
yeast
a
subtle
spice
complex
and
an
impressive
degree
of
refreshment
the
lemon
cuts
the
cloudy
yeasty
beer
to
something
not
way
different
from
a
good
shandy
the
body
is
larger
and
the
carbonation
is
softer
but
the
same
flavor
profile
is
sort
of
there
only
wheat
beer
base
instead
of
standard
lager
a
craft
beer
drinkers
summer
drink
this
needs
a
bit
more
meat
for
wider
seasonal
applicability
i
love
the
finish
too
with
the
best
of
the
grain
and
the
hops
a
very
delicate
but
full
flavored
beer
that
is
in
line
with
the
quality
of
prairies
other
offerings
birra
is
a
highly
refreshing
and
distinctive
flagshiptype
beer
thats
highly
preferable
to
ordinary
lagers
but
its
a
slight
step
down
from
prairie
standard
you
will
be
sorely
missed
taste
sways
from
the
nose
a
bit
doesnt
taste
like
corn
but
has
a
yeasty
semi
bitterness
to
it
with
a
touch
of
sweetbread
in
the
backend
malt
o
i
love
what
these
artisan
ale
places
are
doing
keep
up
the
good
work
cloudy
banana
peel
yellow
with
a
soapy
white
head
that
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
mostly
yeast
driven
with
black
pepper
coriander
and
general
floral
notes
standing
out
hopping
is
mild
lending
more
floral
notes
and
fresh
grassy
bitterness
despite
the
lower
gravity
nothing
is
sacrificed
in
terms
of
flavor
or
interest
good
dryness
with
a
lingering
bitterness
doesnt
come
across
as
thin
which
might
be
expected
the
only
major
fault
in
my
mind
is
that
this
knocked
standard
out
of
the
rotation
i
wish
there
was
room
for
both
great
to
have
a
true
local
session
beer
though
a
great
light
but
not
lite
option
drinks
easy
very
refreshing
nice
take
on
the
style
i
preferred
the
standard
but
this
works
as
well
this
will
go
down
easy
during
our
hellishly
hot
summers
here
o
i
know
i
shouldnt
try
to
compare
this
to
the
prairie
standard
that
it
replaced
but
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
standard
they
describe
this
as
more
sessionable
than
the
standard
but
the
1
difference
in
abv
doesnt
really
do
much
to
make
it
more
sessionable
really
still
at
2
25
a
bottle
after
tax
at
my
local
liquor
store
its
still
a
steal
this
may
be
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
prairie
but
its
still
better
than
80
of
whats
out
there
this
brewery
continues
to
put
out
phenomenal
products
and
really
deserves
more
recognition
keep
up
the
good
work
o
overall
if
i
had
regular
access
to
this
this
would
be
my
go
to
saison
this
beer
kills
it
every
time
ive
had
it
i
love
the
dryness
and
drinkability
and
the
500
ml
format
is
perfect
3
425
it
smelled
like
it
would
be
as
good
as
dupont
too
bad
it
isnt
a
bit
of
a
gusher
but
otherwise
very
tasty
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
farmhouse
damp
straw
and
lemon
the
taste
is
wheat
focused
lightly
tart
some
lemon
bitter
hops
and
earthy
yeast
flavor
cut
tartness
as
a
multi
yeast
beer
it
gets
a
little
too
complex
to
the
point
where
the
flavors
arent
agreeable
good
beer
and
quality
example
of
the
style
but
falls
short
of
the
truly
great
o
a
very
nice
saison
color
and
aroma
very
nice
with
a
classic
farmhousebelgiansaison
taste
funky
spices
without
overpowering
everything
i
love
about
a
farmhouse
saison
here
delicate
spices
light
pear
like
fruit
flavors
nice
carbonation
the
brett
is
what
makes
this
one
instantly
a
favorite
great
brett
in
the
smell
and
taste
not
overpowering
but
enough
to
give
it
that
that
funky
musty
flavor
loved
this
beer
delicious
and
tasty
same
thing
i
know
sitting
on
a
couple
prairie
offerings
at
the
moment
and
this
being
the
first
ive
tried
makes
me
all
the
more
anxious
to
try
more
solid
presentation
of
the
style
slightly
funky
and
easy
drinking
not
your
grandpas
saison
big
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
huge
four
finger
foamy
white
head
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
the
lacing
is
thick
the
odor
is
farmhouse
like
funky
champagne
like
citrus
lemon
grapefruit
spices
earthy
herbal
some
pineapple
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
crisp
very
spicy
clove
lemon
herbal
dry
finish
slight
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
but
maybe
i
am
unfairly
comparing
it
to
bomb
which
i
found
fantastic
i
thought
it
would
pack
more
of
a
punch
the
white
grape
smell
and
taste
is
fairly
strong
and
makes
it
feel
like
i
am
drinking
carbonated
wine
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
jumping
out
at
me
slightly
funky
grassy
earthy
a
touch
of
lemon
pith
a
bit
wheaty
o
a
nice
beer
havent
had
a
belgian
quite
like
it
would
get
again
refreshing
stuff
i
dont
like
in
an
objectively
good
beer
pilsner
malt
wheat
malt
saaz
hops
and
brett
between
spicy
hops
and
saisonstyle
yeast
i
just
kinda
want
it
to
calm
down
and
smoothen
out
it
is
nevertheless
a
classic
saison
black
pepper
and
whatever
pineapple
are
undertones
i
should
read
the
description
before
i
buy
it
but
im
glad
i
to
try
it
10
for
another
bottle
no
way
full
disclosure
its
a
bit
pricey
at
over
55
cents
per
ounce
but
theres
no
denying
its
a
great
brew
and
strong
contender
for
an
american
standard
in
the
style
overall
not
my
favorite
prairie
beer
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
either
nice
clean
finish
and
very
tasty
i
would
drink
this
more
if
i
could
get
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
drink
any
of
this
breweries
offerings
if
i
could
get
them
top
notch
outfit
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
in
my
opinion
overall
a
really
nice
saison
from
a
brewery
id
never
heard
of
until
this
afternoon
this
might
pair
well
with
grilled
meats
or
cheeses
but
drinks
just
fine
on
its
own
too
the
bottle
i
purchased
was
a
bit
smaller
than
the
one
in
the
photo
1

and

pilsner
crispness
im
always
psyched
when
i
come
across
an
excellent
example
of
a
style
with
which
i
am
typically
less
than
enamoured
and
from
an
even
less
likely
point
of
origin
ladies
and
germs
exhibit
a
then
of
a
saison
made
right
in
the
american
subgenre
hoppy
boozy
apparently
and
the
genuine
article
otherwise
yum
overall
a
very
nice
saison
and
interesting
for
a
style
that
seems
hard
to
perfect
the
brett
adds
a
nice
twist
and
really
works
well
in
this
beer
poured
from
a
16

into
a
tulip

as
i
was
hoping
for
a
saison
slightly
bitter
finish
feel
light
lots
of
carbonation
overall
not
overly
impressed
but
still
a
decent
beer
this
was
my
first
prairie
ale
to
try
id
be
willing
to
try
others
but
this
probably
wouldnt
be
my
goto
saison
light
color
with
nice
foam
and
good
carbonation
nothing
noteworthy
on
the
nose
little
bit
of
funk
taste
but
not
overpowering
newbies
arent
repulsed
drinks
clean
and
light
excellent
for
mixed
groups
would
seek
this
one
out
again
not
my
favorite
saison
has
a
big
lemony
tart
nose
with
a
dab
of
barnyard
funk
and
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
pours
hazy
straw
under
a
very
lightly
gold
tinted
white
3
foam
cap
has
a
very
lemony
palate
over
light
grains
that
suggest
a
very
light
short
bread
light
tropical
fruit
white
pepper
with
a
light
spicy
touch
on
the
finish
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
serving
type
bottle
classic
saison
excellent
mouthfeel
spice
brett
and
carbonation
could
drink
this
all
day
long
overall
i
think
i
may
be
ruined
on
other
saisons
truly
an
incredible
beer
o
good
beer
digging
the
funk
of
it
o
overall
this
is
delicious
i
would
recommend
it
to
try
it
out
and
i
would
purchase
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
this
beer
is
dry
and
has
characteristics
i
like
but
the
back
end
is
a
bit
too
much
very
cloudy
pale
yellow
in
color
forms
a
large
fluffy
white
head
looks
like
lemon
meringue
pie
in
a
glass
good
retention
moderate
lacing
powerful
aroma
full
of
tart
lemony
citrus
pineapple
and
lemon
curd
taste
is
similar
strong
lemony
component
though
the
sweetness
is
toned
down
while
the
peppery
spice
is
kicked
up
the
brett
comes
off
fairly
aggressively
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
a
strong
almost
acidic
tartness
which
i
find
to
be
far
too
aggressive
for
the
style
still
a
very
good
example
of
a
brettforward

500

the
beer

with
an

a
half

both
the

retention
and

are

smells
like
yeast

citrus
mostly
lemon
pear
bready

peppery

theres
the

and
some
brett

is

its
smooth
and
its
well
carbonated
its
a
good
lightly
tart
saison
certainly
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before
its
a
good
brew
the
beer
is
extremely
hazy
and
straw
yellow

5
o
solid
example
of
a
farmhouse
saison
sour
would
like
a
little
more
balance
with
the
acidity
another
delicious
saison
try
it
overall
this
aint
too
shabby
but
for
the
price
i
paid
nearly
10
its
not
worth
buying
again
o
this
was
a
nicely
executed
saison
maybe
theres
not
much
to
make
it
stand
out
from
its
peers
but
it
does
very
little
wrong
this
particular
bottle
was
a
touch
overcarbonated
o
im
going
back
and
forth
on
this
one
while
it
delivers
what
it
promises
farmyard
the
extreme
carbonation
and
moderate
bitterness
are
a
bit
off
putting
and
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
rather
than
fruit
or
spice
is
the
most
increasingly
noticeable
attribute
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
amount
of
high
carbonation
this
brew
starts
out
awesome
and
gets
a
little
peculiar
as
the
experience
continues
it
almost
gets
to
the
point
where
it
is
too
warming
and
focuses
on
alcohol
for
only
being
listed
as
8
regardless
id
buy
this
again
if
the
price
was
a
little
more
reasonable
good
beer
but
palate
is
ultimately
too
sweet
and
watery
its
like
a
spritzer
and
i
find
myself
wanting
more
just
a
bit
cloying
o
a
really
nice
saison
with
lots
of
complexity
o
solid
saison
beautiful
blend
of
flavors
with
a
fantastic
aroma
total
2750
o
typical
saison
the
combination
of
yeasts
really
fell
short
for
me
i
was
hoping
to
have
a
brett
bomb
but
instead
found
a
good
example
of
the
saison
style
this
was
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
wasnt
exactly
for
me
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
and
may
not
drink
it
again
ive
had
many
great
drinks
from
prairie
and
would
rather
enjoy
one
of
those
again
than
this
very
very
drinkable
complex
and
refreshing
poured
into
a
gavroche
tulip
if
youve
ever
seen
there
will
be
blood

the
end
i
would
say
this
is
a
fairly
light
pineapple
o
this
is
a
saison
the
flavors
are
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
a
perfect
warm
weathe
beer
o
good
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
lime
taste
is
a
nice
change
sort
of
confused
by
the
reviews
of
this
one
beguiled
by
prairie
perhaps
regardless
its
a
decent
representation
of
this
style
but
it
fell
short
in
virtually
every
category
for
me
very
faint
citruslemon
and
farmhouse
flavors
but
overall
i
just
get
malt
and
an
almost
lager
taste
eh
am
i
missing
something
here
tastes
like
perfume
and
flowers
i
get
dough
and
bread
on
the
backend
and
an
earthiness
as
well
i
assume
this
isnt
how
it
normally
is
or
at
least
i
hope
not
prairie
standard
45
o
this
is
a
decent
saison
i
expected
more
coming
from
prairie
id
like
the
saison
yeast
to
shine
through
a
little
more
overalls
this
is
a
decent
offering
that
is
pretty
drinkable
highly
carbonated
spritsy
brew
overall
its
decent
but
not
crazy
good
standard
saison
id
drink
it
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
schooner
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
yellowstraw
coloring
with
a
fizzy
filmy
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
toasted
grains
lemon
zest
dill
basil
jasmine
tangerine
cut
grass
and
subtle
pepper
spice
flavors
are
a
little
more
hop
forward
with
a
bit
of
cedar
grassy
notes
and
a
citrus
blend
of
tangerine
and
lime
the
spice
blend
is
there
too
to
layer
the
palate
light
bready
backbone
almost
like
a
pie
crust
with
some
lemon
notes
coming
forward
at
the
end
of
the
palate
the
body
is
full
but
light
in
mouth
with
a
citrus
and
herbal
balance
in
the
aftertaste
the
finish
is
light
smooth
and
slightly
effervesced
extremely
drinkable
beer
i
loved
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
a
clear
yellow
golden
color
with
visible
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
fingers
worth
of
white
head
that
disappears

overall
a

would
be

on

day
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
find
it
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
tickle
the
tongue
light
caramel
and
biscuit
throughout
the
beer
simple
and
yet
wonderful
lemon
and
kiwi
come
in
from
the
hops
such
a
solid
american
saison
love
this
super
balanced
beer
man
this
would
be
awesome
if
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
very
drinkable
perfect
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
a
meal
not
a
showstopper
just
wonderful
not
every
beer
needs
to
be
profound
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
a
few
of
it
is
a
nice

a

i
really
dug
this
one
recommendation
its
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
pick
it
up
overall

i
think
this
is
an
ok
brew
overall
and
i
wont
have
any
problems
finishing
the
4pack
but
its
not
one
of
the
better
prairie
ales
ive
tried
the
longer
i
drank
this
the
less
i
liked
it
still
its
worth
picking
up
if
youve
never
had
it
before
hazy
yellow
with
a
frothy
sticky
white
head
on
top
aroma
is
spicy
and
on
the
sharp
side
at
first
freshly
milled
malt
cracked
pepper
wet
hay
flowers
and
earth
flavor
gets
things
working
more
in
harmony
the
peppery
yeast
is
still
at
the
forefront
but
a
nice
cereal
maltiness
starts
to
smooth
it
out
before
a
light
lime
and
melon
finish
fairly
light
and
zesty
leaving
the
mouth
dry
definitely
has
the
drinkability
nailed
down
the
aroma
is
perhaps
a
little
overly
rustic
but
it
helps
lend
an
authentically
farmhouse
feel
to
the
whole
deal
hazy
golden
straw
colored
beer
with
a
nice
cakey
white
head
that
in
due
time
fades
to
a
lumpy
layer
leaving
a
sticky
ring
of
sheety
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
bit
wacky
farmhouse
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
an
unidentified
stinky
fruit
that
is
somewhere
between
tropical
and
fig
and
bergamot
a
little
winelike
slightly
phenolic
certainly
floral
with
maybe
honey
and
an
interesting
array
of
spicy
yeasty
aromas
taste
follows
right
along
the
same
lines
white
wine
nuances
slight
tart
bitterness
rooty
veggies
a
shroomy
earthiness
spicy
hop
and
wild
flowers
or
potpourri
mouthfeel
is
smooth
evenly
and
finely
carbonated
approaching
dryness
and
somewhat
fluffy
in
texture
overall
an
enjoyably
farmy
earthy
and
fairly
unusual
saison
nice
clean
quaffable
saison
bright
carbonation
and
slight
funkiness
great
simplicity
here
notes
of
melon
banana
and
long
grains
good
stuff
for
a
hot
day
or
a
freezing
one
begging
for
summer
i
found
a
bottle
in
a
local
liquor
store
a
week
or
two
after
visiting
tulsa
where
i
noticed
prairie
beers
available
on
tap
it
has
a
bit
of
hop
but
the
overall
taste
leans
toward
belgianstyle
yeast
extra
crisp
and
refined
flavor
profile
super
clean
and
dry
with
no
off
notes
simplicity
at
its
absolute
finest
sweeter
style
saison
nice
hop
bite
cuts
through
some
of
the
sweetness
reminds
me
a
bit
of
tank
7
too
much
phenol
for
my
liking
maybe
a
bad
bottle
i
have
some
others
from
a
newer
batch
that
i
will
try
again
damn
this
is
impressive
the
nose
is
brilliant
fragrant
rustic
fruity
wild
hoppy
yeasty
phenolic
and
balanced
grainy
with
a
clean
pils
malt
character
fruity
with
a
blend
of
lemon
and
some
tropical
fruit
wild
without
brett
in
that
theres
an
earthy
yeasty
funk
hoppy
with
a
clean
bitterness
and
phenolic
with
a
blend
of
saison
yeast
and
spices
the
palate
is
wellrepresented
on
the
nose
is
light
in
body
and
crisply
carbonated
brilliantly
focused
and
structured
this
can
give
uprights
five
a
run
for
its
money
in
the
hoppy
saison
category
excellent
stuff
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
its
a
good
brew
my
only
complaint
is
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
body
other
than
that
is
is
solid
i
could
drink
this
one
more
often
if
it
were
more
readily
available
thanks
to
unclejazz
for
the
bottle
a
really
nice
understated
brew
soft
and
well
balanced
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
yeast
notes
as
well
as
hop
herbaceousness
and
spice
pleasent
and
easy
to
drink
othis
beer
was
really
well
done
we
know
prairie
carries
a
rep
for
great
stouts
and
i
was
impressed
to
see
what
they
could
do
with
a
saison
i
admit
the
saison
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
definitely
go
for
this
one
again
if
the
mood
were
to
strike
me
crisp
light
and
refreshing
tastes
like
lime
awesome
this
beer
came
to
me
from
my
son
in
texas
who
is
fortunate
to
be
able
to
purchase
prairie
artisan
ales
locally
i
had
some
of
their
beers
last
year
when
i
visited
him
and
was
very
pleased
to
find
their
version
of
a
farmhouse
ale
in
the
box
he
sent
me
on
the
first
pour
it
is
golden
in
color
with
a
full
white
head
nice
carbonation
and
great
lacing
thru
the
quaff
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
sweet
pickles
and
on
the
first
sip
you
can
taste
the
complex
blending
of
sweet
and
sour
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
refreshing
finish
the
last
pour
of
the
beer
is
totally
different
in
color
totally
cloudy
almost
opaque
with
sediment
but
the
taste
didnt
vary
still
deeelicous
and
i
love
their
labels
and
the
bottle
cap
featuring
the
catfish
o
enjoyable
but
i
wont
chase
this
one
down
for
a
repeat
of
the
americanstyle
dryhopped
saisons
this
might
be
the
most
delicate
presentation
ive
had
yet
the
hops
are
present
but
not
overbearing
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
just
fantastically
melded
together
wonderful
daily
drinker
and
at
a
very
accessible
abv
not
bad
for
the
raul
man
light
with
clove
and
slight
bananalike
qualities
but
its
the
posh
spice
spice
that
gives
this
lil
sucker
a
lil
junk
in
the
trunk
smooth
and
sexy
like
raul
after
a
sunday
wash
this
bad
boy
could
be
a
constant
thing
a
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
from
prairie
o
a
nice
american
take
on
the
farmhouse
style
a
saison
that
brings
significant
hopping
but
does
not
lose
interest
in
the
floral
grass
and
barnyard
of
the
original
style
a
nice
introduction
to
the
fine
work
coming
out
of
prairie
artisan
ales
a
purists
saison
with
a
very
welcomed
hop
addition
spice
acidity
soft
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
are
right
on
this
was
my
first
prairie
beer
but
will
definitely
not
be
my
last
next
up
bomb
overall
highly
drinkable
refreshing
and
satisfying
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
beer
any
time
pours
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
is
decent
lacing
is
a
good
amount
has
the
funky
farmhouse
sour
fruit
aroma
slightly
hoppy
up
front
with
some
spicy
carbonation
and
sour
fruit
funk
at
the
end
typical
farmhouse
funky
aftertaste
very
representative
of
the
type
of
beer
enjoyable
i
love
this
beer
and
i
love
the
label
how
to
noodle
for
catfish
only
these
guys
right
haha
the
beer
in
the
bottle
is
fantastic
it
pours
rather
clear
until
the
last
fifth
or
so
of
the
bottle
when
the
sediment
rolls
out
its
blonde
and
hazy
its
pale
and
really
really
fizzy
tickles
my
nose
as
i
smell
the
new
zealand
lemony
hops
oozing
from
it
and
a
mild
french
saison
yeast
that
pairs
geniusly
with
the
hops
i
like
that
the
yeast
is
subtle
here
its
distinct
really
drying
with
a
touch
of
white
wine
esters
but
its
not
dominating
and
lets
the
malt
and
hops
contribute
nearly
equally
the
hops
are
so
cool
i
love
the
new
zealand
stuff
citrus
and
that
peculiar
oil
property
only
these
strains
have
enough
carbonation
for
a
couple
of
saisons
which
i
really
like
effervescence
is
always
flattering
to
this
style
and
with
a
mildly
creamy
light
to
medium
body
its
the
perfect
effect
for
what
i
like
i
plan
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
while
its
on
shelves
way
better
then
the
last
four
pack
they
put
out
birra
o
4
95
i
went
in
to
this
review
expecting
to
give
this
probably
around
a
4
maybe
i
rated
this
so
highly
because
i
havent
had
many
saisonfarmhouse
ales
i
dont
know
this
was
my
first
one
to
review
and
i
will
definitely
be
trying
some
more
of
this
style
i
thought
the
big
imperial
stouts
reigned
supreme
but
damn
i
enjoyed
this
beer
33
for
prairie
so
far
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
full
white
lacy
head
sweet
lemon
earthy
aroma
earthy
citrus
sweet
pineapple
genuine
farmhouse
sourness
i
like
this
beer
its
different
i
liked
it
a
lot
i
can
see
this
being
the
perfect
summer
beer
overall
the
perfect
afternoon
beer
with
big
bright
hop
flavors
slightly
funky
finish
and
a
smooth
malt
that
wipes
the
palate
clean
if
this
was
year
round
there
would
be
no
doubt
this
would
a
goto
especially
in
the
summer
92100
dry
refreshing
champagneesque
beer
very
sessionable
but
also
because
its
at
times
a
bit
tame
and
mild
compared
to
what
it
feels
like
it
could
be
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
grainy
funk
peppery
gingery
flavor
follows
suit
a
medium
bodied
active
mouthfeel
overall
this
has
quickly
become
become
my
favorite
american
saison
tied
with
funkwerks
saison
not
sure
what
more
i
could
ask
for
in
a
saison
just
a
wonderful
beer
from
prairie
o
very
nice
drinking
saison
nothing
overwhelms
you
here
with
this
brew
but
its
damn
fine
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
had
this
sitting
outside
when
it
was
90
out
and
this
hits
the
spot
would
gladly
have
another
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
definitely
an
every
day
type
of
beer
i
really
enjoy
the
hoppy
presence
to
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
slight
orange
head
the
smell
that
immediately
hit
was
a
grassy
hoppy
peppery
grains
the
taste
was
very
similar
prickly
spices
earthy
grains
citrus
hops
lots
of
carbonation
added
to
the
peppery
flavors
and
made
my
tongue
tingle
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
true
belgian
style
farmhouse
ale
overall
just
a
solid
everyday
drinking
saison
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
the
best
hoppy
saisons
in
the
style
but
its
only
barely
below
i
have
to
say
that
the
limelike
characteristic
isnt
something
im
used
to
coming
across
in
beer
so
it
definitely
has
unique
points
going
in
its
favor
not
sure
if
its
release
is
seasonal
but
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
4pack
whenever
i
see
it
on
shelves
which
so
far
has
been
rather
infrequently
o
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
i
wish
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
instead
of
a
spicy
sour
tart
saison
not
a
horrible
beer
though
i
can
see
why
this
is
their
everyday
beer
try
it
if
you
want
but
im
buying
something
else
theres
tint
to
the
orangeyellow
color
topped
with
a
billowy
head
which
leaves
spots
of
lace
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
with
one
smell
i
had
an
idea
that
i
was
working
with
a
saison
the
aroma
has
lemon
peel
vague
spice
a
moderate
farmhouse
stink
so
common
of
the
style
regarding
its
taste
its
a
somewhat
sour
flavor
overall
which
doesnt
really
get
funky
slightly
tart
lemons
a
kick
of
grass
and
vague
citrus
make
the
flavor
with
its
drying
and
spiced
finish
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
pairing
with
a
home
grilled
steak
o
good
saison
with
the
unique
and
subtle
flavor
of
lime
and
cracked
pepper
ill
admit
up
front
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
but
this
was
quite
drinkable
it
never
went
over
the
top
in
any
direction
a
crisp
smooth
easy
daily
drinker
for
folks
that
look
for
such
things
o
really
solid
smooth
and
flavorful
all
around

from

o
overall
a

straight

and
well
crafted
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
by
prairie
these
guys
know
how
to
make
saisons
nice
traditional
notes
mixed
i
with
a
tinge
of
americana
and
nz
at
that
overall
a
pretty
awesome
hoppy
saison
pairs
the
best
flavors
of
hops
spices
and
fruity
tartness
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
a
four
pack
of
this
instead
of
a
single

a

to
it

dry
bitterness
keeps
lingering
on
mouthfeel
is
vibrant
a
little
heavy
for
what
the
flavor
profile
brings
tasty
saison
id
say
although
id
rather
buy
a
4
pack
of
rayon
vert
for
the
money
taste
a
lot
of
citrus
with
a
toned
down
barnyard
funk
hoppy
but
not
on
the
same
level
as
an
ipa
or
barleywine
fine
carbonation
and
smooth
mouthfeel
so
dry
and
refreshing
that
i
could
easily
see
myself
pounding
8
or
10
of
these
suckers
on
a
serious
college
football
saturday
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
farmhouse
ale
overall
this
is
really
gorgeous
stuff
although
why
im
still
surprised
that
another
beer
from
prairie
is
gorgeous
i
dont
really
know
this
is
the
third
or
fourth
of
theirs
ive
tried
and
they
just
have
such
a
knack
for
providing
beautifully
subdued
complexity
and
wonderful
drinkability
to
their
beers

definite

finishing

a

on

serious
summertime
session
beer
here
what
an
excellent
brew
o
a
great
little
saison
glad
i
got
to
try
one
in
my
notes
i
used
the
descriptor
zesty
a
lotfor
both
aroma
and
flavor
it
is
zesty
vibrant
active
and
lively
i
found
a
delicate
citrusy
character
with
some
clear
lemongrass
aromas
tasty
to
boot
with
a
fresh
lemonlemongrass
character
to
it
while
finishing
dry
having
been
introduced
to
this
on
tap
im
more
than
curious
to
see
how
it
comes
across
in
the
bottle
the
nose
seems
to
be
the
ideal
highlight
of
the
beer
but
even
its
light
body
doesnt
distract
from
the
palate
and
flavors
this
is
a
real
easy
drinking
flavorful
saison
could
easily
be
the
beer
a
non
saison
beer
drinker
would
get
into
overall
a
great
offering
from
prairie
id
recomend
this
for
anyone
venturing
into
the
bret
category
but
not
quite
into
the
fullfunkiness
a
great
hybrid
beer
tmo
incredibly
refreshing
what
an
everyday
beer
its
crisp
cold
and
bitter
without
being
abrasive
the
yeast
is
light
only
hinting
at
spice
or
funk
in
an
interesting
way
the
finish
is
clean
and
the
aftertaste
dry
low
on
flavor
perhaps
but
a
solid
beer
that
could
replace
a
pale
ale
in
just
about
anybodys
repertoire
highly
recommended
if
pricy
o
while
this
is
certainly
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
ever
encountered
i
do
believe
it
is
meant
to
be
the
flagship
beer
and
i
feel
it
is
a
very
nice
take
on
the
saison
the
feel
is
airy
bubbly
and
light
with
a
slight
expansiveness
in
the
mouth
o
great
saison
with
a
lot
of
quality
characteristics
going
on
aside
from
just
looking
pretty
its
a
very
enjoyable
saison
with
drinkability
absolutely
in
its
favor
would
recommend
to
the
farmhouse
ale
fan
or
those
just
getting
into
the
wonderful
world
of
brettanomyces
o
its
a
great
offering
from
prairie
id
tone
down
the
carb
a
bit
and
make
the
nose
more
fragrant
other
than
that
spot
on
saison
clean
refreshing
high
apparent
bitterness
like
an
pilsnersaisonamerican
pale
ale
in
one
the
hops
assert
themselves
enough
to
be
the
dominant
component
and
linger
in
the
finish
but
not
overbalance
the
biscuity
malt
or
spice
of
the
yeast
highly
sessionable
hops
carry
more
than
their
fair
share
of
the
load
with
some
zesty
yeast
and
sourdough
bread
yeast
is
there
but
it
is
not
as
soft
and
complex
as
say
a
saison
dupont
a
touch
overcarbonated
but
nothing
a
few
swirls
of
the
glass
cant
fix
id
rather
a
saison
be
overcarbed
than
under
its
a
pretty
damn
good
saison
one
of
the
most
rustic
versions
you
will
find
this
side
of
the
atlantic
i
am
really
happy
to
have
a
good
pseudolocal
saison
producer
so
close
cheers
to
you
prairie
o
this
beer
is
working
on
so
many
different
levels
definitely
a
hopped
up
saison
but
theres
more
to
it
than
just
that
cheers
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
lime
and
some
clove
taste
begins
with
a
tart
citrus
flavor
followed
by
a
touch
of
funk
in
the
middle
and
a
grassy
woody
finish
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
and
creamy
overall
a
good
saison
i
think
i
prefer
hop
forward
beers
to
have
a
more
neutral
yeast
though
very
drinkable
and
interesting
nice
flavors
for
the
abv
definitely
looking
forward
to
checking
out
more
from
this
brewery
c
o
quite
tasty
the
citrusy
pineapple
type
flavors
really
saved
this
one
for
me
light
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
delicious
o
a
great
said
on
one
of
my
favorites
lots
of
citrus
to
go
with
that
classic
saison
funk

a

overall
quite
enjoyable

wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
a
great
summer
afternoon
beer
o
really
unique
american
take
on
a
wallonian
saison
so
far
prairie
is
three
for
three
in
my
book
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
this
brewery
to
fans
of
funky
idiosyncratic
belgianinspired
ales
the
flavor
grows
after
some
sipping
and
the
belgian
yeast
leaves
its
mark
on
your
tongue
but
it
also
gets
more
harsh
this
would
be
a
good
one
for
trader
joes
to
put
in
cans
its
hardly
worth
the
price
theyre
asking
bought
at
bottleworks
in
san
diego
nostalgia
aside
this
beer
is
very
well
made
and
is
worldclass
overall
a
nice
hoppy
sessionable
saison
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
overall
really
solid
beer
at
first
i
did
not
much
care
for
it
but
it
really
grew
on
me
throughout
the
tasting
love
the
take
on
the
style
shows
hops
do
have
a
place
in
the
saison
style

some
light
bready

chardonnay

note
ends
on
a
slightly
peppery

note
could
use
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
but
a
really
nice
saison
d
a
nice
farmhouse

promising
start
for
a
new

in
the
market
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
of
prairies
offerings
in
the
future
poured
into
a

this
farmhouse
style

pours
a
hazy

color

goodsized
white

its
nose
has
white
grape
lemon
grass
and
some

interesting
smell
a
nice
one
to
be
sure
the
taste
is
more
lemon
pepper
a
funk
certainly
presents
itself
grassy
yeast
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
but
this
is
no
subpar
table
saison
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
is
fairly
bitter
in
the
finish
but
it
leaves
you
craving
some
more
of
it
all
in
all
a
really
nice
flavorful
beer
with
interesting
characteristics
to
it
its
good
to
know
that
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
basement
what
better
place
to
start
with
a
new
brewery
than
their
standard
eh
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
mild
orange
zest
light
sweet
biscuit
and
a
general
sense
of
a
rustic
field
or
something
along
those
lines
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
pervasive
rustic
tartness
theres
some
decent
funk
in
here
but
it
doesnt
go
overboard
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
damn
solid
saison
heavy
on
both
the
funk
and
the
enjoyment
o
hoppy
light
citrus
candy
in
a
bottle
a
unique
sweetiness
in
their
beers
d
very
nice
the
hop
aroma
is
excellent
and
the
balanced
finish
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
half
finger
head
with
little
retention
and
some
lacing
on
a
clear
dark
golden
body
aroma
is
excellent
with
nice
presence
of
the
hops
including
lemon
zest
peppercorn
grapefruit
tangerine
and
mild
yeast
presence
flavor
of
bready
malts
belgian
yeast
lemon
zest
sweet
and
mildly
tart
citrus
grass
and
club
soda
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
with
only
a
semidry
finish
very
nice
hop
additions
here
with
the
saison
and
belgian
presence
at
the
base
which
is
well
balanced
and
not
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
o
this
is
a
well
crafted
saison
that
would
do
well
for
anyone
venturing
into
this
style
wish
i
could
find
beer
like
this
in
wi
for
summer
thanks
to
deadonhisfeat
for
sending
one
my
way
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
light
shallow
hue
with
only
a
slight
head
and
no
real
lacing
nose
is
a
really
strong
combination
of
pine
honey
and
spice
flavor
is
a
lightly
hopped
hay
with
a
subtle
touch
of
fermented
fruit
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
jd
very
nice
traditional
saison
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
towering
soapy
head
slowly
settling
to
a
thin
layer
with
a
couple
of
rings
of
sticky
lace
left
behind
smell
tangerine
spiciness
apricot
dough
dry
grass
taste
grapefruit
zest
sweet
orange
pepper
grape
and
grassy
notes
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
juicy
feel
really
nice
overall
nice
beer
not
extremely
memorable
but
tasty
look
forward
to
more
of
these
guys
offerings
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
is
fizzy
looking
but
has
a
good
retention
and
a
light
scattered
lacing
the
smell
is
spicy
and
herbal
very
interesting
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
a
little
on
the
spicy
side
some
earthy
grain
and
a
dryness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
light
bodied
overall
its
a
pretty
good
saison
would
enjoy
trying
their
other
beers
what
a
nice
beer
it
kind
of
combines
the
feel
and
character
of
a
saison
with
the
flavor
of
an
american
pale
ale
or
american
pale
wheat
ale
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
but
with
some
complexity
i
predict
i
will
be
buying
6packs
of
this
beer
over
the
summer
to
serve
as
a
goto
thirstquencher
oa
very
enjoyable
saison
and
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
for
those
that
want
to
baby
step
into
the
funk
on
the
hoppier
side
for
the
style
prairie
is
kind
of
taking
the
state
of
ok
by
storm
with
their
brews
and
i
can
see
why
o
cant
say
farmhousesaisons
are
the
style
of
beer
i
seek
but
its
not
bad
id
probably
wouldnt
choose
to
have
this
again
but
thats
not
because
of
the
eer
itself
as
it
is
to
the
style
o
a
fantastic
summer
saison
that
is
clean
and
crisp
super
great
flavors
im
proud
of
this
oklahoma
breed
creation
i
cant
wait
to
pick
up
a
sixer
cheers
o
a
delightful
american
saison
not
americanized
this
is
to
style
and
very
well
done
o
a
solid
standard
i
do
feel
like
there
are
too
many
similar
flavors
here
and
they
do
stumble
together
rather
than
having
the
elements
complement
each
other
id
still
buy
this
again
one
of
the
more
unique
saisontype
things
ive
encountered
a
super
unique
fruitiness
that
works
well
with
the
blatant
yet
mellow
belgian
yeast
very
rustic
with
a
very
unique
hop
profile
a
really
nice
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
saison
an
excellent
saison
and
i
am
so
glad
i
came
across
another
prairie
artisan
offering
really
well
done
highly
recommended
o
well
the
name
of
the
beer
really
is
best
way
to
describe
it
this
is
about
as
solid
as
you
can
get
in
terms
of
a
standard
belgian
saison
it
has
the
farmhouse
distinctive
smell
and
taste
with
a
nice
light
crisp
drinkable
feel
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
i
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
ok
brewery
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
the
screw
top
is
the
only
real
downer
and
lack
of
date
decent
appearance
nice
floral
nose
between
the
malts
hops
and
saison
aromas
and
quite
a
nice
surprise
with
the
farmhouse
funk
flavor
and
blend
of
nice
hops
that
get
a
decent
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
the
summer
and
i
think
i
will
a
nice
mellow
standard
saison
im
not
sure
anything
sets
this
apart
from
the
rest
but
nothing
draws
me
away
from
it
either
great
intro
saison
i
think
it
fits
its
name
very
well
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
am
sure
i
will
have
no
problem
going
through
the
case
i
picked
up
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
batch
of
fantome
printemps
i
recently
had
pours
a
glowy
golden
color
relatively
light
mildly
cloudy
big
white
head
puffs
up
quickly
and
sticks
around
for
some
time
lots
of
big
bubbles
aroma
is
applepear
cider
earthy
and
mineralish
flavors
and
a
grassy
hoppiness
theres
a
little
spice
of
spice
in
the
mix
possibly
from
the
hops
some
nice
bready
grain
notes
its
nice
just
a
bit
weak
and
that
apple
cider
flavor
dominates
mild
funk
the
taste
is
an
improvement
for
me
on
the
palate
its
a
pleasant
mildly
sweet
saison
with
a
light
spicy
hoppiness
quite
refreshing
dries
out
in
the
finish
bright
malt
flavor
and
a
spicy
floral
hop
bitterness
more
funk
very
nice
beer
pretty
gentle
carbonation
for
the
style
light
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
another
very
good
beer
from
prairie
i
preferred
prairie
hop
and
prarie
ale
but
this
is
an
impressive
beer
to
see
in
12
ounce
packs
i
look
forward
to
more
from
the
brewery
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
pepper
lime
juice
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
peppery
and
chalky
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
this
one
super
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
hoppy
saison
ales
i
think
ive
had
its
not
overly
funky
and
bretty
but
but
the
hop
and
saison
funk
marriage
is
well
executed
were
neither
outshine
the
other
awesome
o
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
a
starter
and
not
something
to
turn
to
after
having
anything
bigger
since
this
is
more
delicate
and
simple
look
forward
to
trying
others
from
this
brewery
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
very
flavorful
saison
that
has
good
complexity
and
balance
and
a
nice
assertive
hop
bitterness
went
out
on
a
limb
on
this
one
and
turned
out
to
be
a
good
find
definitely
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
especially
during
the
summer
time
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
a
bottle
that
has
artwork
showing
instructions
for
noodling
i
e
sticking
your
hand
in
underwater
holes
to
catch
catfish
great
stuff
a
good
domestic
version
of
the
style
hits
the
right
points
and
has
enough
complexity
some
flaws
but
fairly
drinkable
12
oz
bottle
served
in
a
prairie
tulip
glass
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
golden
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
bit
of
straw
pepper
fruity
esters
and
earthygrassy
hops
flavor
is
pale
malts
grainy
pepper
lemon
yeasty
and
a
hint
of
funk
mouthfeel
is
light
dry
refreshing
and
slightly
bitter
really
good
beer
great
session
beer
oa
nice
sessionable
saison
with
good
flavor
a
great
summer
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
anyone
looking
for
a
different
take
on
the
saison
style
would
enjoy
this
beer
personally
ill
probably
continue
to
drink
local
and
buy
oxbow
when
i
want
a
hoppy
saison
but
i
am
excited
to
see
what
else
prairie
sends
to
us
in
maine
o
this
is
really
nice
low
abvs
make
this
real
drinkable
real
light
on
the
tongue
altho
the
high
carbonation
makes
this
bubble
in
the
tummy
so
cant
have
too
many
it
could
be
a
bit
thicker
that
being
said
i
would
buy
this
again
the
beers
high
rate
of
drinkability
makes
it
seducing
its
easy
to
ignore
its
clean
taste
as
lacking
complexity
but
its
balance
and
subtlties
rewards
the
patient
drinker
drink
after
drink
its
about
as
close
as
belgians
get
to
session
ales
fairly
complex
with
enough
farmhouse
character
to
add
intrigue
and
enough
supporting
flavor
to
excite
the
palate
which
most
examples
of
the
style
tend
to
lack
easy
drinker
this
will
be
a
go
to
beer
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
fairly
subtle
but
flavorful
enough
to
make
want
another
would
love
to
try
this
on
draft
to
get
a
comparison
i
could
tear
up
some
sushi
thai
or
indian
food
with
this
o
a
straight
forward
yet
tasty
saison
solid
but
nothing
special

this
beer
is
really
what
i
search
for
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
in
a
5
2
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
prairies
offerings
in
the
future
also
from
what
i
understand
this
is
the
brewer
from
redbud
cuvee
3
and
4
are
awesome
beers
too
someone
is
doing
it
right
served
in
prairie
artisan
ales
glassware
nice
looks
great
clear
goldenrod
with
an
inchthick
cap
of
white
foam
that
lays
down
a
few
rings
of
lace
excellent
balance
of
flavors
tropical
fruits
honey
lime
pepper
clove
and
a
punch
of
spicy
hops
malt
is
clean
with
a
light
sugar
cookie
sweetness
and
rustic
cereal
flavor
more
refined
than
the
bottled
version
a
sessionable
flavorful
locally
brewed
saison
whats
not
to
like
a
new
goto
at
better
beer
bars
the
beer
pours
a
transparent
golden
with
two
fingers
of
white
foam
it
has
an
herby
sour
smell
the
taste
is
crisp
and
slightly
sour
with
hints
of
orange
and
sour
apple
the
mouthfeel
seemed
both
crisp
and
flat
not
too
sour
along
with
a
manageable
abv
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
osuch
a
great
session
saison
they
hoppy
notes
of
citrus
really
take
this
one
way
over
the
top
i
only
wish
i
had
this
on
the
shelves
locally
also
worth
noting
the
best
beer
label
ive
seen
in
some
years
absolutely
hilarious
love
to
see
a
5
abv
saison
awesome
aroma
fresh
and
dry
with
plenty
of
hop
character
while
not
taking
over
the
other
flavors
needs
a
little
more
carbonation
its
low
right
off
the
bat
and
quickly
drops
off
very
good
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
prairie
and
im
excited
to
try
more
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
anytime
definitely
a
fine
belgian
i
get
the
simcoe
and
citra
as
well
as
the
tangerine
bitter
orange
and
spicy
belgian
yeasties
however
i
get
no
peach
or
mango
as
described
maybe
my
pallet
needs
some
work
good
offering
but
may
not
order
another
nice
looking
beer
very
earthy
kind
of
a
grassy
mildly
inky
clayish
thing
going
on
floral
and
perfume
tones
are
there
as
well
very
faint
touch
of
sweet
with
a
doughy
and
yeasty
thing
there
too
nice
belgian
style
ale
love
to
see
american
breweries
producing
belgian
ales
on
this
level
o
great
complexity
and
flavors
that
make
this
very
good
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orange
with
short
white
foam
looks
nice
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
nose
is
grapefruit
nice
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
just
what
id
expect
from
the
style
i
feel
a
bit
of
the
heat
from
this
very
slight
funk
taste
less
than
expected
very
crisp
and
drinkable
would
drink
again
but
i
much
prefer
the
prairie
ale
o
a
very
nice
saison
not
too
funky
nice
mild
fruitiness
very
nice
mouthfeel
finishes
with
just
enough
flavor
to
make
you
go
back
for
more
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
little
will
drink
again
this
is
not
just
a
hop
driven
saison
its
a
monster
of
saison
with
hops
integrated
perfectly
they
never
steal
the
show
only
complement
the
yeasty
complexity
awesome
on
so
many
levels
oh
cool
make
me
review
this
in
order
to
give
a
rating
hows
this
for
a
review
overall
its
the
cleanest
beer
i
think
i
have
ever
drank
it
leaves
no
sticky
residue
in
the
mouth
after
drinking
it
its
kind
of
like
a
saison
but
not
really
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
this
beer
because
its
not
really
an
ipa
and
its
not
really
a
belgian
hopped
up
ale
either
its
very
unique
really
totally
enjoyable
i
was
excited
to
stumble
upon
this
recently
while
traveling
through
maryland
a
standard
pour
yields
a
voluminous
three
plus
fingers
worth
of
light
airy
fluffy
snow
white
head
comprised
of
mostly
huge
chunky
bubbles
excellent
retention
once
settled
there
is
a
mostly
full
veil
of
lacing
and
moderatetothick
collar
the
color
is
a
slightly
pale
mix
of
light
straw
and
muted
amber
a
moderate
bit
of
carbonation
some
of
which
clings
to
the
glass
and
some
of
which
rises
briskly
throughout
some
lacing
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
head
starts
to
settle
the
nose
is
big
and
assertive
its
equal
parts
belgian
yeast
blast
and
citrusy
hop
goodness
it
smells
like
youre
standing
right
next
to
the
brew
kettle
vibrant
lemon
and
orange
zest
some
nice
light
earthy
character
as
well
grassy
and
belgian
yeast
to
start
a
bit
of
an
earthy
hop
bite
throughout
some
light
peppery
notes
on
the
finish
on
the
fuller
side
of
light
bodied
very
delicate
limited
carbonation
airy
but
not
thin
in
any
way
just
a
subtle
touch
of
dryness
quite
unique
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
a
very
unique
and
highly
enjoyable
brew
a
tremendous
introduction
to
prairie
artisan
ales
the
saison
character
wins
out
by
a
bit
but
the
american
hop
presence
add
layers
of
complexity
and
dimension
that
make
this
a
must
try
for
any
self
respecting
beer
geek

the
tropical

really
give
it
a
unique
twist

theres
plenty
of

the

overall
a

drinkable

isnt
giant
nowadays
but
this
thing
drinks
like
a
session
beer
what
a
treat
o
a
delicious
and
heavily
hopped
saison
the
saison
characteristics
are
hidden
behind
the
heavy
handed
hop
notes
but
they
do
sometimes
make
an
appearance

and
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
think
its
a
good
hoppy
saison
another
quality
prairie
brew
its
pricey
at
10
99
a
bottle
but
its
a
tasty
brew
definitely
worth
trying
overall
an
outstanding
wellcrafted
beer
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
favorite
dryhopped
saisons
from
the
likes
of
logsdon
and
upright
how
does
this
have
a
94
taste
is
earthy
with
that
typical
belgian
flavor
but
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
the
hop
taste
is
weak
is
totally
forgettable
this
is
my
least
favorite
prairie
offering
to
date
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
overall
bright
refreshing
saison
layered
with
hoppy
and
fruity
notes
no
hint
of
its
8
abv
o
a
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
saison
not
quite
as
aggressive
as
some
of
the
style
but
definitely
tasty
not
enough
flavor
disappointed
in
this
one
after
all
the
good
words
i
had
heard
just
not
enough
of
a
saison
or
hoppy
kinda
down
the
middle
of
the
road
at
55mph
good
beer
but
not
outstanding
3
5
is
all
it
gets
from
me
on
tap
at
gainesville
world
of
beer
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
creamy
white
one
finger
head
into
my
tulip
aroma
of
big
funky
saison
yeast
grassy
hops
some
pine
very
sweet
honey
notes
and
some
other
fruits
in
there
flavor
follows
with
very
sweet
fruits
from
the
hops
a
bit
of
zesty
citrus
peel
bite
grass
honey
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
expected
but
lightened
up
by
the
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
very
nice
but
not
what
i
had
expected
going
in
definitely
a
good
beer
but
easily
one
of
my
least
favorite
prairie
saisons
out
there
overall
weve
been
very
excited
to
try
our
first
brew
from
prairie
and
our
first
brew
from
oklahoma
this
one
certainly
fits
the
bill
and
doesnt
disappoint
it
is
a
nice
and
dank
saison
overdone
with
a
thorough
dry
hopping
this
allows
for
the
hops
to
become
part
of
the
equation
without
overwhelming
it
said
hops
are
subtle
but
add
a
definite
bitterness
to
the
taste
that
continually
enhances
and
deepens
with
warmth
every
component
here
is
really
well
defined
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
intensely
drying
and
is
probably
the
most
enjoyable
and
memorable
aspect
of
this
beer
they
really
hit
that
stylistic
point
right
on
the
head
there
has
been
a
big
outflowing
of
these
hopdriven
saisons
lately
and
the
cultural
shift
is
nearly
palpable
this
is
no
doubt
a
product
of
that
revolution
and
it
is
welcomed
with
open
arms
we
cant
wait
to
see
what
else
prairie
has
in
their
arsenal
overall
4

i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
prairie
and
perhaps
my
favorite
saison
of
course
im
a
sucker
for
the
heavily
hopped
saisons
but
they
arent
all
done
wellits
just
that
this
one
is
its
the
kind
of
marriage
between
the
two
core
elements
of
american
hops
and
belgian
yeast
styles
that
provides
incentive
for
brewers
to
keep
pushing
boundaries
because
when
they
work
sometimes
they
really
work
ap

o
amazing
balance
between
hops
and
lightly
toasted
malts
and
fruit
pours
gold
with
a
huge
thick
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
duration
of
the
session
aroma
offers
lemon
ginger
tropical
fruit
pepper
and
a
touch
woody
a
light
and
crisp
almost
prickly
active
mouthfeel
that
finishes
wonderfully
dry
overall
loved
it
and
right
up
there
for
me
with
my
overall
favorite
american
saisons
like
funkwerks
saison
and
firestone
walkers
opal
only
thing
that
would
prevent
me
from
drinking
this
one
again
is
the
price
point
should
be
4
to
5
cheaper
imo
delicate
flavor
compared
to
the
slightly
funky
floral
and
fruity
nose
flavors
of
peach
lemon
grass
and
a
little
yeast
bitter
finish
pours
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and

are
excellent

funky
belgian

some

taste
citric
spicy
hops
at
the
end
there
is
a
slightly
funk
aftertaste
pretty
much
a
hoppy
farmhouse
ale
good
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
you
pay
for
it
should
be
at
least
45
cheaper
light
and
crisp
perfect
aroma
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
had
very
light
lemony
grassy
hoppy
nose
with
a
bit
of
pine
and
herbal
tones
the
flavor
starts
more
piney
with
some
grassy
straw
and
herbal
hop
notes
as
the
beer
warms
or
my
palate
adjusted
this
began
to
really
open
it
became
much
more
fruity
with
a
strong
peach
flavor
i
also
caught
notes
of
mango
and
tangerine
but
it
seemed
the
peach
was
more
prevalent
interesting
take
on
a
saison
as
the
hops
seemed
to
compliment
the
flavor
rather
well
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
saison
drinker
but
i
can
definitely
appreciate
this
one
o
intersting
take
on
farmhouse
ale
grass
and
floral
notes
are
amazing
grassy
floral
lemony
with
light
herbal
notes
and
earthy
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
this
definitely
varies
from
the
traditional
saison
but
that
takes
nothing
away
from
this
being
an
amazing
beer
huge
tropical
hop
flavors
with
a
softjuicy
mouthfeel
that
could
make
me
drink
this
all
day
93100
overall
pleasant
if
not
quite
the
flavor
bomb
i
was
expecting
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
perhaps
an
entry
level
representation
but
i
dont
claim
to
know
much
of
this
particular
style
overall
a
really
solid
saison
i
loved
how
fruity
and
hoppy
this
one
was
very
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
bubbly
white
head
huge
aroma
of
tropical
fruits
yeast
and
piney
hops
easily
one
of
the
best
aromas
ive
come
across
tangerine
pineapple
and
mango
stand
out
theres
a
touch
of
spice
and
the
hops
give
it
a
decent
bitterness
medium
mouth
with
a
carbonated
crispness
the
other
dryhopped
saisons
ive
tried
were
middling
at
best
this
one
is
juicy
and
flavorful
pours
a
bright
golden
orange
with
a
shimmering
offwhite
head
sour
grapefruit
goodness
to
the
nose
orange
and
lemon
zest
with
a
little
sugar
and
spice
and
other
light
ripe
fruits
too
tastes
of
lemon
belgian
yeast
and
grain
with
a
fine
hop
finish
dry
as
can
be
and
a
little
crackery
in
the
end
so
fine
so
fine
a
fresh
fruity
dry
and
hoppy
like
mimosa
in
a
glass
quite
tasty
like
most
prairie
brews
easy
to
see
why
so
many
like
this
brew
its
freaking
good

no

overall
love
this
one
fresh
yet
complex
and
offers
a
lot
to
observe
and
play
with
everything
in
good
balance

nice
smooth
apricot

has
a
nice
dusty

with
a
hint
of
tangy
spice
lots
of
golden
fruits
from
the
saison
and
notes
of
it
from
the
hops
taste
is
even
more
dusty
and
yeast
forward
with
a
great
balance
of
bright
golden
fruits
in
back
light
hop
bitterness
that
adds
to
the
flavor
very
dry
finish
lighter
body
and
assertive
carbonation
really
nice
stuff
here
but
gets
a
touch
sweeter
as
it
warms
this
is
a
superb
saison
in
any
case
the
hops
just
raise
it
to
the
level
where
its
genuinely
exciting
its
a
gorgeous
beer
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on

of
the
beer

dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
and
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
0
after
bomb
maybe
my
favorite
so
far
from
prairie
lovely
drinkable
beer
highly
recommended
almost
a
ideal
mix
of
an
ipa
and
a
saison
send
more
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
im
not
sure
there
was
anything
particular
here
to
make
it
stand
out
above
several
other
similar
beers
but
still
quite
good
if
it
was
sitting
on
the
shelves
around
here
on
a
regular
basis
id
pick
one
up
every
once
in
a
while
for
sure
o
man
am
i
sad
to
see
this
one
go
15
for
a
bottle
but
ill
probably
pick
up
another
theres
so
much
going
on
i
think
they
nailed
the
balance
on
this
one
from
sweet
fruitiness
to
sour
farmhouse
this
is
arguably
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
and
thats
not
an
exaggeration
got
in
a
trade
with

isnt
enough
prairie
hop
is
one
of
the
better
newish
saisons
ive
had
plenty
more
of
these
will
be
drank
in
my
future
o
a
nice
belgian
ale
the
hops
are
minimal
though
despite
the
name
still
its
well
crafted
for
whats
there
overall
sick
literally
might
be
a
top5
beer
in
my
life
big
statement
i
realize
but
i
think
this
beer
is
fantastic
that
said
farm
house
is
my
favorite
style
really
easy
drinker
drinks
quite
nicely
fair
freshness
and
zest
balanced
with
a
good
earthiness
this
is
clever
brewing
and
a
very
nice
introduction
to
the
world
of
oklahoma
beer
brew
on
sooner
state
o
the
full
juicy
hops
has
some
great
compliments
in
the
yeast
esters
and
some
nice
malt
support
this
beer
drinks
very
fast
the
taste
is
right
along
the
same
path
the
hops
are
juicy
and
then
their
bitterness
rushes
the
funky
part
of
the
grainynut
flavor
through
my
mouth
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
mediumslightly
thick
creamy
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
i
also
get
a
subtle
herbal
flourish
and
orange
rind
is
in
there
too
the
slightly
antique
flavor
i
took
as
peanut
butter
sits
well
in
the
aftertaste
somehow
the
finish
is
dry
but
right
the
foam
from
the
head
is
intact
halfway
through
the
chalice
into
which
i
poured
this
appearing
like
cream
nice
i
dont
recall
having
a
beer
that
kept
such
a
thicktop
form
unique
brew
recommended
by
local
retailers
here
in
north
texas
however
i
passed
on
it
until
now
curiosity
paidoff
big
time
oklahoma
is
on
the
craft
map
here
in
a
big
way
with
in
my
opinion
this
is
as
of
now
my
second
favorite
saison
excellent
overall
high
drinkability
seek
o
very
nice
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
so
hop
forward
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
one
would
of
preferred
to
share
with
someone
not
a
beer
i
would
typically
drink
on
my
own
very
satisfied
with
my
first
prairie
beer
overall
delicious
beer
especially
on
a
warm
afternoon
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
prairie
o
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
saison
though
it
could
use
some
more
pronounceddefined
flavors
o
great
saison
i
am
always
slightly
skeptical
of
new
breweries
however
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
go
out
and
buy
everything
that
prairie
has
out
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
walks
the
line
between
ipa
and
saison
overall
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
buy
if
you
ever
find
it
overall
not
a
lot
of
saison
here
but
nice
hop
flavors
should
also
be
noted
that
this
beer
had
more
of
a
peach
aroma
and
flavor
than
two
other
beers
that
claimed
to
have
peach
added
to
them
good
stuff
overall
solid
brew
this
is
my
first
out
of
oklahoma
and
i
am
definitely
impressed
with
this
brew
and
would
have
it
again
so
yeah
this
tries
to
be
orval
and
it
does
an
okay
impersonation
i
like
it
better
than
greenflashs
iteration
but
the
same
as
rayon
vert
hops
hoppiness
is
a
bit
sticky
and
american
and
in
some
unarticulable
way
it
just
dont
jibe
up
with
the
belgian
blondeyness
of
the
beers
opening
half
pretty
good
still
overall
a
fine
beer
by
prairie
perhaps
this
wasnt
the
freshest
bottle
as
there
were
no
tropical
or
citrus
flavors
to
be
found
prefer
the
very
similar
standard
at
12
a
sixpack
o
excellent
beer
a
real
standout
i
am
certainly
going
to
be
looking
out
for
more
prairie
ales
in
the
future
o
this
was
nothing
short
of
superb
amazingly
drinkable
yet
amazingly
complex
there
is
something
here
for
anyone
i
wanna
stock
this
baby
year
round
o
a
nice
hoppy
saison
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
leadint
to
a
lightly
fizzy
quicklybecomingfoamy
mouthfeel
that
suits
the
beer
quite
well
closes
semidry
with
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
o
very
interesting
beer
and
a
very
good
one
artfully
crafted
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
bubbly
overall
a
new
favorite
of
mine
excellent
use
of
hops
here
that
play
nicely
with
the
farmhouse
yeast
for
an
uberrefreshing
summer
beverage
o
overall
a
damn
fine
hoppy
saison
wish
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
tropical
but
even
with
that
its
still
damn
delicious
well
done
prairie
a
delicately
hopped
saison
that
is
among
the
best
i
have
ever
had
o
a
very
good
hoppy
saison
made
with
american
hops
id
consider
it
more
like
a
belgian
ipa
regardless
it
tastes
and
smells
nice
its
assertive
but
not
over
the
top
mouth
feel
is
not
very
dry
and
thats
ok
with
me
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
it
is
getting
better
as
it
airs
out
too
perfectly
stated
packaging
opens
to
reveal
a
most
excellent
aroma
it
pours
with
a
rich
golden
straw
color
crowned
by
dense
pale
head
that
slowly
reduces
to
a
thin
ever
present
visually
pleasing
icing
for
this
wonderful
slice
of
rich
cake
the
taste
is
incredible
it
as
if
someone
has
taken
my
favorite
ipa
and
blended
it
with
the
best
of
belgian
saisons
this
beer
left
me
satisfied
yet
wanting
another
like
a
a
drug
addict
needing
another
fix
matt
the
beerguy
t
lots
of
smooth
sweet
malt
mingling
with
musty
funk
a
peppery
hop
finish
mixed
with
some
mango
and
a
bit
of
a
buttery
mouthfeel
the
feel
was
a
touch
heavy
for
me
but
this
is
a
really
good
saison
get
it
verdict
a
nice
take
on
the
saison
by
prairie
but
it
definitely
lacks
many
qualities
of
a
traditional
belgian
saison
the
fruit
character
is
refreshing
and
enjoyable
and
was
easily
the
highlight
of
this
beer
overall
really
solid
stuff
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
definitely
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
offerings
from
prairie
c
pours
out
a
cloudy
golden
apricot
with
a
thick
white
head
that
eventually
recedes
smells
strongly
of
sweet
citrus
peel
and
pine
belgian
character
is
overwhelmed
by
hops
pale
malts
flavor
is
also
very
hopforwarded
kind
of
sweet
up
front
with
a
drying
finish
belgian
yeast
plays
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
could
use
some
more
carb
in
the
mouth
as
an
ipa
i
love
this
as
a
hoppy
belgian
its
pretty
solid
orange
color
slightly
hazy
fluffy
head
tropical
and
citrus
aroma
apricots
pineapple
as
well
as
spices
like
black
pepper
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
light
but
not
thin
thanks
to
carbonation
one
of
the
best
examples
of
ipa
and
saison
available
on
the
market
such
a
great
saison
one
of
the
best
ive
had
prairie
hop
took
a
belgian
style
beer
and
melded
it
with
an
american
hop
profile
better
than
any
other
offering
i
have
tried
this
is
truly
a
world
class
saison
very
impressed
so
far
with
prairie
and
this
is
no
exception
poured

into
tulip

grassy
taste
starts
with
smooth
belgian
yeast
and
lots
if
straw
some
citrus
fruit
some
tropical
fruit
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
that
drys
out
substantially
as
it
finishes
very
earthy
theres
a
nice
little
funk
to
this
beer
that
mixes
well
with
the
hoppy
belgian
wit
flavors
a
very
unique
beer
that
balances
some
complex
flavors
very
well
jd
overall
extremely
refreshing
the
hops
really
add
some
nice
elements
to
this
one
grassy
and
fruity
this
is
an
excellent
saisonhop
beer
with
a
tremendous
smoothness
and
balance
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
brew
and
will
be
coming
back
to
it
often
tart

tangerine

lends
sweetness
earthy
bitter

ghostly

pleasant
and

it
finishes
dry
with
some
lingering
herbals
from
the
base
saison
complexity
is
there
this
beer
is
really
well
put
together
and
drinkable
for
fans
of
crooked
stave
fantome
etc
this
had
a
vibrant
orange
color
like
a
warm
horizon
at
sunset
the
smell
was
of
fresh
mango
and
a
bite
of
fresh
hop
pine
secondary
orange
banana
and
pineapple
taste
is
if
you
can
imagine
like
the
best
mcdonalds
orange
drink
ive
ever
had
orange
julius
with
lots
of
teeth
that
bite
your
tongue
and
hold
on
as
you
drink
it
this
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
on
the
bottle
a
hoppy
farmhouse
ale
and
its
wonderful
see
prairie
drink
prairie
overall
this
is
tasty
but
gets
knocked
down
a
little
due
to
price
13
for
a
750
o
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
saisons
brewed
i
wish
this
was
distributed
to
wi
because
i
would
buy
it
frequently
in
the
summer
months
way
to
go
prairie
ales
thank
you
4balance
d
fantastic
hoppy
saison
great
balance
and
complexity
as
near
a
perfect
beer
as
you
can
get
especially
for
warmer
weather
opened
a
bottle
courtesy
of
regular

partner
chocosushi
pours
a
nice
orangegolden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
nice
lacing
with
a
prominent
ring
that
lasts
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
reminds
me
of
pte
lots
of
hoppy
pineapple
tangerine
and
citrus
aromas
with
just
a
touch
of
saisonfarmhouse
yeast
taste
follows
the
nose
simply
fantastic
perfect
body
and
mouthfeel
for
a
saison
to
me
this
is
what
a
saison
would
be
if
russian
river
took
their
recipe
for
pte
and
made
a
farmhouse
version
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
year
extremely
well
done
prairie
and
i
look
forward
to
your
distribution
area
arriving
in
texas
soon
poured
from
a
caged
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
goldenstraw
coloring
with
a
frothy
big
bubbled
light
bright
white
head
that
retains
around
an
inch
and
a
half
solid
stream
of
carbonation
bubbling
throughout
also
aromas
of
wet
greens
initially
with
some
citrus
hops
highlights
and
coriander
spicing
flavors
are
extremely
well
balanced
with
a
forward
flavor
of
wet
peppery
hops
balanced
with
citrus
and
berry
sweetness
there
is
a
bready
and
roasted
backbone
that
also
blends
and
supports
the
spice
and
funk
slightly
warming
and
the
smooth
body
makes
this
a
severely
easy
drinker
wow
candy
sweet
and
herbal
aftertaste
that
balances
perfectly
and
is
subtle
enough
to
draw
you
further
in
smooth
clean
finish
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
spice
left
behind
to
linger
great
brew
hazy
bright
orange
appearance
in
the
glass
with
a
light
white
head
many
tiny
bubbles
bounce
to
the
surface
the
scent
has
a
fair
bit
going
on
the
yeast
is
very
faint
as
the
hops
take
over
with
citrus
and
some
grassypine
the
taste
is
like
tangerine
juice
loads
of
tangerine
flavor
with
a
bittering
finish
the
finish
is
a
clean
bitterness
though
that
plays
well
and
balances
im
a
big
fan
of
the
effervescence
in
this
beer
it
makes
the
beer
much
brighter
and
even
more
enjoyable
to
drink
i
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
a
saison
it
almost
drinks
like
a
beermosa
it
was
a
pleasure
and
quite
tasty
overall
okay
this
one
blew
me
away
just
amazing
tropical
fruit
smell
and
flavour
that
goes
so
well
with
the
saison
yeast
i
need
more
of
this
thanks
again
will
highly
recommended
if
you
can
find
it
hazy
to
clodu
golden
body
with
nice
lacing
and
a
single
finger
head
without
much
retention
aroma
of
breads
musty
belgian
yeast
saison
funk
clove
tangerine
and
pineapple
citrus
flavors
are
very
belgian
with
yeast
funk
both
tart
and
sweet
generic
citrus
caramel
and
breads
a
little
peppery
hops
are
mild
and
likely
provide
more
of
the
citrus
and
earthy
flavors
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
with
a
semidry
finish
d
very
nice
the
funky
yeast
character
is
excellent
and
while
i
might
like
a
bit
more
hop
character
i
did
enjoy
what
it
added
to
the
party
o
hoppy
light
and
sweet
citrus
a
unique
but
pleasant
candylike
flavor
a
bottle
from
the
most
recent
release
which
just
hit
the
market
last
week
so
this
should
be
really
fresh
bright
goldorange
airy
head
of
white
foam
that
builds
to
several
fingers
and
lays
down
some
nice
lace
vibrant
citrus
tropical
herbal
minty
powdery
hoppiness
is
front
and
center
a
rustic
graininess
keeps
it
somewhat
in
line
with
the
farmhouse
theme
in
the
face
of
the
barrage
of
big
american
hops
other
complementary
flavors
include
black
pepper
woodiness
and
a
grungy
earthiness
but
really
its
all
about
the
bright
hoppiness
dryness
accentuates
the
hoppiness
further
one
of
my
favorites
from
paa
this
needs
to
be
available
in
more
formats
light
body
with
good
carbonation
very
refreshing
11
for
a
bomber
bottle
overall
a
well
built
saison
i
especially
enjoy
the
subtle
use
of
hops
in
this
beer
the
base
saison
seems
to
be
solid
but
the
earthy
and
spicy
hop
varieties
really
bring
this
all
together
o
loving
this
flavor
smells
like
an
ipa
but
drinks
like
a
tart
saison
lovely
one
of
the
best
saisons
if
not
beers
altogether
that
ive
had
in
some
time
this
pours
a
soft
pale
amber
color
faintly
red
with
at
least
two
inches
of
sturdy
white
head
and
some
suspended
yeast
its
mysteriously
pale
and
is
emitting
scents
of
far
out
yeast
fresh
and
abundant
citrus
hops
and
a
medium
pale
malt
body
with
the
dryness
of
an
irish
red
the
flavor
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
as
far
as
hops
and
wild
yeast
goes
its
familiar
like
mikkellers
farmhouse
invasion
minus
the
brett
substitute
spicy
apply
saison
yeast
thats
got
all
the
farm
you
can
handle
the
hops
are
plenty
bitter
but
also
cleverly
fruity
which
makes
for
excellent
balance
every
sip
is
different
cascading
a
new
part
of
my
palate
challenging
yet
comforting
me
at
the
same
time
the
craftsmanship
behind
the
bubbles
here
is
so
profound
i
promise
you
the
beer
world
will
start
to
talking
about
prairie
before
long
before
this
weekend
i
had
never
heard
of
them
at
all
and
this
week
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
bottle
of
the
noir
in
my
rare
beer
club
and
its
burning
a
hole
through
my
fridge
im
sure
ill
drink
it
tonight
after
work
unless
i
can
garner
some
self
control
this
is
maybe
the
best
saison
ever
made
and
it
takes
a
lot
for
me
to
say
that
the
way
the
aggressive
hops
and
the
funky
yeast
play
off
each
other
is
pure
bliss
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
few
bottles
of
this
youll
never
look
back

the
dry

was
still
kicking
in
this
one
but
its
a
pretty
nice
take
on
a
hoppy
saison
nice
flavors
not
an
outofstyle
amount
of
hop
bitterness
wow
really
tasty
soft
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
should
appeal
both
to
fans
of
saisons
and
fans
of
american
pale
ales
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
but
with
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
my
main
grip
is
that
i
feel
this
beer
could
use
more
carbonation
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
pours
a
hazy
vibrant
orange
with
thin
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
little
trace
wonderful
aroma
of
peaches
pineapple
mango
grass
and
flowers
flavors
of
stone
fruit
citrus
and
a
touch
of
yeast
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
crisp
clean
finish
complex
beer
with
many
layers
so
far
im
a
fan
of
prairie
artisan
ales
overall
a
nice
dry
hopped
saison
that
i
really
enjoyed
but
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
great
beer
big
saison
character
under
loads
of
tropical
hops
o
interesting
and
pretty
good
saison
it
was
just
too
overwhelmingly
peachyfruity
which
started
to
get
to
me
after
awhile
this
prevents
me
from
putting
it
with
my
top
saisons
a
beautiful
marriage
between
a
sublime
american
ipa
and
a
fastastically
rustic
belgian
saison
my
hats
off
to
prairie
artisan
ales
honestly
this
beer
tastes
like
what
the
nectar
of
the
gods
must
taste
like
it
makes
me
want
to
cry
i
cant
get
it
where
i
live
trading
partners
if
youre
out
there
find
me
pours
a
malty
amber
brown
with
decent
clarity
and
a
nice
finger
of
foam
nose
hasbright
notes
of
citrus
spicy
yeast
esters
white
pepper
lemon
grass
and
a
light

the
beer
really
pops
in
the
mouth
complex

along
with
a
suttle
yeastiness
which
lets
the
melon
and
citrus
shine
slight
earthiness
rounds
out
this
very
complex
well
made
brew
easy
to
drink
with
the
7
barely
noticeable
this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
very
cloudy
and
somewhat
milky
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
very
soapy
white
head
the
nose
is
in
your
face
pineapple
and
belgian
yeast
paired
with
a
nice
level
of
grassy
hoppiness
great
nose
the
flavors
are
bright
and
hoppy
with
excellent
grassiness
lemon
grapefruit
and
it
finishes
with
a
pineapple
bomb
of
fruit
character
in
the
finish
that
dominates
the
after
taste
i
dont
think
ive
ever
seen
that
much
pineapple
in
any
saison
it
is
very
unique
and
more
importantly
incredibly
good
you
dont
notice
the
7
at
all
either
making
this
one
dangerous
and
overly
drinkable
this
is
my
first
prairie
experience
and
it
blew
me
away
this
is
an
incredibly
flavorful
and
special
saison
i
highly
recommend
it
o
blending
of
simcoe
and
citra
hops
lend
an
ipaish
quality
while
the
yeast
and
spices
balance
the
traditional
saisonfarmhouse
style
really
nice
and
would
have
again
fantastic
hoppy
saison
the
hop
notes
were
perfect
to
compliment
the
rustic
nature
of
the
saison
o
really
nice
saison
great
cross
of
styles
its
halfway
between
a
belgian
ipa
and
a
saison
nice
pepper
and
tropical
fruit
notes
that
compliment
each
other
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
it
goes
quite
well
delicious
overall
nice
and
different
try
it
pours
a
deep
orange
nearly
brown
quite
murky
the
offwhite
head
kicks
up
a
finger
or
two
of
foam
but
it
quickly
fades
to
a
smattering
of
bubbles
aroma
is
full
of
wonderful
saison
complexity
theres
a
big
earthy
note
really
nice
the
hops
contribute
grassy
and
floral
flavors
that
blend
into
the
beer
without
dominating
it
a
blend
of
fruity
flavors
also
crop
up
pears
grapes
apricots
plums
lemons
persimmons
pineapples
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
strong
as
the
prairie
ale
which
hit
pretty
much
all
the
right
saison
notes
for
me
theres
just
a
touch
too
much
malt
sweetness
but
its
still
quite
good
lots
of
spicy
grassy
hop
flavor
comes
across
on
the
tongue
also
more
musty
barnyardy
character
than
in
the
aroma
the
malt
just
isnt
quite
as
bright
or
crisp
as
id
like
but
its
still
tasty
just
not
quite
up
to
the
other
flavors
good
grassy
herbal
hop
finish
almost
a
bit
minty
good
champagneish
feel
lots
of
fine
bubbles
full
i
prefer
prairie
ale
by
just
a
bit
but
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
this
young
brewery
very
impressive
work
this
is
a
beer
to
seek
out
easily
one
of
the
best
american
ipabelgian
style
beers
ive
had
and
it
seems
everyone
is
trying
their
hands
at
it
i
like
this
beer
dry
hopping
has
made
this
a
very
interesting
farmhouse
ale
fans
of
the
style
should
seek
this
one
out
i
would
have
preferred
better
head
retention
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
good
enough
for
me
to
ignore
my
issues
with
its
appearance
this
is
an
amazing
hoppy
saison
they
nailed
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorite
american
versions
at
that
tank
7
and
saison
brett
are
among
my
favorites
and
this
is
just
as
good
i
guess
there
is
a
new
contestant
for
great
american
saisons
well
done
overall
pretty
nice
a
well
done
saison
and
nice
fresh
hops
to
go
with
it
the
hops
go
well
with
teh
saison
as
expected
nice
grassy
little
leafy
and
floral
some
lemony
citrus
zest
and
just
enough
bitterness
the
saison
flavors
are
on
nicely
too
not
too
much
funk
which
would
have
overpowered
the
subtle
hops
drinkable
and
tasty
well
done
i
would
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
no
problem
not
in
a
row
of
course
the
beer
is
masterful
as
it
really
does
strike
the
perfect
balance
between
whats
best
about
properly
constructed
saison
and
experimental
newwave
hops
its
a
delicious
beer
making
drinkability
effortless
o
the
aroma
on
this
is
heavenly
seriously
amazing
the
flavor
is
good
but
is
a
huge
letdown
after
the
smell
o
a
very
well
done
belgian
style
beer
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
ipa
it
is
a
very
well
done
saisonfarmhouse
ale
that
offers
so
much
more
than
just
a
typical
saison
as
i
stated
before
i
really
would
have
guessed
this
more
to
be
an
unfiltered
belgian
style
ipa
very
well
done
and
i
hope
they
keep
making
more
i
like
this
very
drinkable
this
to
me
is
like
tank
7s
slightly
smaller
brother
a
little
less
in
your
face
with
the
hops
a
touch
more
funkyness
a
bit
more
overall
finesse

oi
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
every
offering
from
prairie
and
withholding
an
infected
bottle
of
noir
and
while
they
are
all
exceptional
i
think
prairie
hop
is
my
favorite
its
so
bright
and
vibrant
with
a
really
nice
peachy
presence
citra
hopped
that
transcends
the
nose
and
taste
its
exceptional
the
beer
pours

a
very
thin

head
the
nose
is

hoppy
with
a
touch
of
bubble

the
taste
is
definitely
yeasty
with
a
great
underlying
slightly
floralcitrusy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
great
hoppiness
that
lingers
this
is
a
great
beer
that
keeps
a
great
hoppiness
throughout
drinking
with
great
belgian
yeast
characteristics
id
recommend
this
beer
for
others
to
try
especially
of
you
enjoyed
bitter

appearance
is
a
dark
amber
smells
of

very
nice
grapefruit
as
an
inexperienced
hop
head
how
should
i
put
this
it
has
the
taste
of
some
great
ipas
ive
had
in
the
past
with
a
very
good
aftertaste
i
know
what
tastes
good
and
what
tastes
bad
when
it
comes
to
ipas
and
this
is
high
up
there
on
the
list
of
yummy
tasting
stuff
nothing
bad
about
this
beers
flavor
in
my
opinion
taste
is
a
subjective
thing
i
know
try
it
i
dont
think
youll
be
let
down
i
recently
had
a
lagunitas
hop
stoopid
and
would
rank
it
on
about
the
same
level
if
that
helps
great
beer
while
i
appreciate
this
beer
im
not
in
love
with
the
hop
profile
tongue
numbing
floral
and
too
much
to
have
more
than
1
glass
prairie
merica
45
i
admit
some
bias
here
because
nelson
sauvin
is
not
my
favorite
hop
something
about
it
often
reminds
me
of
dayold
chinese
food
yet
this
brewery
has
delivered
outstanding
brews
time
and
time
again
wasnt
exoecting
the
funk
in
this
one
didnt
see
brett
listed
on
the
label
but
wow
a
nice
surprise
well
done
from
prairie
as
expected
overall
4

i
really
really
like
this
beer
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
if
i
brewed
beer
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
id
want
to
make
every
single
day
the
mix
of
funk
body
drinkability
and
complex
mixture
of
bread
fruit
and
vinous
character
make
for
a
dynamic
beer
thats
easy
for
anyone
to
enjoy
i
love
this
beer
but
i
sure
do
wish
it
didnt
cost
10
a
bottle
ah
well
and
occasional
pleasure
i
suppose
but
at
least
it
gives
me
something
to
shoot
for
when
judging
other
similar
beers
and
hopefully
the
type
of
beer
i
brew
in
the
future
thanks
prairie
ill
definitely
be
pulling
the
tigger
on
your
brews
more
often
now
overall
just
another
delicious
tasting
prairie

add
to
the

although
gets
a

sweet
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
even
for
500
ml
o
i
thought
this
was
a
very
interesting
complex
and
tasty
beer
this
was
my
first
beer
from
prairie
and
they
have
set
the
bar
high
with
this
one
tropical
white
grape
peach
white
pepper
sweet
fruit
earthy
very
light
tartness
too
sweet
tastes
like
someone
poured
a
bunch
of
table
sugar
into
a
brett
saison
o
it
is
another
awesome
brew
from
prairie
something
you
would
very
much
expect
with
a
sour
would
drink
again
great
sour
it
smells
really
nice
and
fruit
undetones
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
for
a
saison
and
the
sour
really
comes
through
10
for
500
ml
bottle
o
this
was
a
nice
and
very
traditional
tasting
saison
great
balance
between
yeast
and
hop
characeter
o
ive
had
my
share
of
saisons
and
i
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
here
i
cant
even
call
the
after
taste
funk
i
may
try
to
find
a
fresher
bottle
and
try
this
again
but
for
the
mean
time
i
have
to
give
it
a
2
25
overall
smells
pretty
good
but
tastes
nothing
like
it
in
a
very
bad
way
i
found
this
beer
very
hard
to
drink
due
to
the
harsh
earthy
acidic
flavor
and
bad
dry
aftertaste
pour

a

brett
rather
hoppy
overall
this
is
a
truly
wonderfully
put
together
brew
nelson
sauvin
was
an
outstanding
choice
for
this
brew
their
inherent
cutting
edge
was
a
perfect
marriage
with
the
white
wine
and
brett
aspects
bravo
o
i
love
everything
that
prairie
does
except
some
vanilla
noir
bottles
and
this
cant
win
them
all
o
a
very
nice
beer
with
an
out
of
balance
mouthfeel
finish
is
extremely
yeasty
and
dry
to
the
detriment
of
all
the
other
pleasant
qualities
the
brew
presents
even
so
it
glows
with
craftsmanship
this
was
made
with
love
and
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
is
notable
in
the
flavor
profile
which
is
complex
and
enjoyable
its
just
too
bad
the
finish
is
so
over
the
top
in
its
dryness
and
bitterness

head

really
well
and
by
the
time
i
finished
the
sample
the
head
was
still
holding
aroma
is
straight
floral

such
a
great

unique
smell
taste
is
floral

with
a
good

banana

flavorful
complex

well
integrated
and
executed
definitely
potent
cheesey
and
yeasty
o
lots
of
brett
funk
in
the
aroma
with
some
nice
fruity
notes
mixed
in
i
definitely
pick
up
that
cat
litter
characteristic
in
this
beer
and
its
a
little
overpowering
at
times
i
see
that
as
its
only
downfall
overall
very
complex
and
a
nice
intro
to
prairie
for
me
what
can
i
say
this
beer
is
highly
attenuated
and
wonderful
the
earthy
funk
and
hop
bitter
combine
with
yeast
and
bugs
to
create
greatness
definitely
recommended
overall
a
hop
forward
saison
for
me
the
hops
were
a
little
too
heavy
handed
and
did
some
weird
things
with
the
brett
its
almost
like
someone
peed
on
a
barn
floor
once
the
beer
warmed
up
a
pleasant
lactic
tangyness
appeared
in
the
nose
and
taste
i
did
enjoy
the
nice
malty
finish
and
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
of
that
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
with
a
frothy
couple
inch
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
very
long
time
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
bready
malt
yeast
grasshay
pears
funk
and
some
lemon
peel
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
green
grapeswhite
wine
and
some
citrus
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
crisp
and
also
well
carbonated
the
soft
carbonation
helps
make
this
brew
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
merica
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
certainly
liked
it
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
some

really
good

for

really

i
really
like
this
beer
not
only
because
i
have
newfound
respect
for
okie
brewing
but
because
this
is
a
bold
experiment
in
funk
and
i
am
a
better
person
for
having
tried
it
cheers
to
prairie
artisan
ales
o
one
of
the
best
american
interpretations
of
a
belgian
style
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
looks
like
were
taking
this
farmhouse
idea
and
running
with
it
honestly
given
the
choice
between
an
american
wild
ale
and
a
belgian
one
im
pretty
sure
id
pick
the
american
theres
novelty
and
originality
in
every
bottle
of
this
brew
plus
a
yeast
cake
so
thick
you
could
probably
scoop
it
out
and
spread
it
on
toast
if
thats
not
good
beer
i
dont
know
what
is
atmosphere
is
really
good
hazy
with
a
thick

plenty
of

with

citrus
crisp
hoppy
and
yeasty
with
some
fermented

accentuates
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
saison
well
done
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
tight
carbonation
up
front
as
well
as
strong
zesty
spice
and
earthy
hop
flavors
that
linger
over
the
other
notes
into
a
bone
dry

bread
biscuit
apple
and

a
bit
one
dimensional
with
all
of
the
dryness
from
the
hops
and
brett
but
there
is
subtle
sweetness
and
a
strong
bready
yeast
component
balancing
things
out
some
pineapple
and
grapefruit
hop
flavor
buried
underneath
but
overall
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
too
dryone
note
for
my
preference
complex
for
sure
but
the
dry
hops
and
brett
and
prominent
bready
yeast
notes
overpower
almost
everything
else
o

with

and
some
lemon

mouthfeel
is
lively
and
crisp
without
being
overcarbonated
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
these
guys
to
date
o
a
bitter
zesty
spicey
farmhouse
that
has
some
unique
flavors
i
like
the
beer
and
might
try
it
again
but
probably
not
something
id
keep
on
regular
rotaion
o
im
most
impressed
with
how
prairie
manages
to
create
such
a
complex
beer
with
one
malt
one
hop
and
one
yeast
strain
i
give
most
of
the
credit
to
their
yeast
strain
it
produces
an
excellent
saisonfarmhouse
ale
that
would
give
most
other
saisons
a
run
for
their
money
i
really
only
have
two
complaints
1
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
id
dial
down
the
ibus
by
5
or
so
2
i
wish
the
hop
was
more
fruitforward
than
grassforward
i
prefer
my
saisons
on
the
fruity
side
so
a
different
hop
choice
would
throw
this
over
the
top
for
me
funky
saison
yeast
with
a
nice
strong
hop
influence
flavors
meld
nicely
and
it
creates
a
unique
brew
would
really
like
to
know
more
about
their
yeast
pours
a
hazy
sandy
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
passionfruit
lemon
grapes
sweet
apples
a
little
spice
and
a
touch
of
bread
flavor
is
huge
bitter
passionfruit
and
lemon
grapes
come
out
to
offer
some
sweetness
once
it
begins
to
noticeably
warm
up
some
pepper
cracker
funk
and
grassy
bitterness
a
crisp
active
dry
mouthfeel
overall
worth
the
hype
prairie
wowed
me
with
my
first
beer
from
them
d
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
for
1
hop
and
1
malt
very
nice
o
nice
hoppy
saison
from
prairie
a
little
bit
hoppy
a
little
bit
funky
a
little
bit
winey
a
little
bit
spicy
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
quite
complex
overall
really
a
quite
nice
american
style
saison
o
this
is
a
very
solid
saison
for
how
simple
it
is
quite
enjoyable
thank
you
harold
for
sending
me
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
great
very
nice
tropical
fruit
from
the
both
the
hops
and
some
with
a
little
tangy
brett
augmenting
with
some
light
malt
sweetness
to
cushion
the
bitterness
level
with
a
nice
tangy
white
grape
tinge
of
nelson
this
deserves
the
rating
since
it
melds
a
nice
wild
character
with
a
more
hop
forward
saison
nice
flavor
aroma
and
is
very
drinkable
someone
below
said
its
reminiscent
of
fantome
not
in
any
way
is
this
accurate
fantome
is
my
favorite
brewery
of
all
time
but
taste
nothing
like
this
both
are
amazing
but
in
different
ways
a
rustic
and
interesting
ale
glad
to
have
tried
it
was
not
inspired
to
drop
another
nine
bucks
on
a
bottle
however
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
in
the
glass
flavors
opened
up
and
showed
more
depth
and
my
opinion
improved
vaguely
reminiscent
of
fantome
saison
which
is
high
praise
o
its
a
bit
1d
but
thats
obvious
given
the
ingredients
i
cant
complain
and
its
very
refreshing
to
drink
m
light
bodied
very
refreshing
overall
solid
beer
to
very
good
beer
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
this
is
what
its
all
about
boys
and
girls
definitely
my
favorite
offering
from
prairie
this
far
overall
this
brewery
has
impressed
me
so
much
in
the
past
few
days
this
saison
reminds
me
of
the
outstanding
blvd
saisonbrett
its
slightly
hoppier
and
a
bit
dryer
but
still
amazing
tart
funky
earthy
juicy
and
dry

would
drink
again
really

earth
yeast
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
citrus
tropical
and
brett
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
brett
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
great
brett
forward
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
this
one
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
note
pouring
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
into
the
glass
yields
a
more
milky
appearance
that
resembles
old
stale
orange
juice
it
does
make
the
beer
a
bit
better
albeit
a
bit
more
sourdoughy
o
nice
example
of
an
american
saison
extremely
palatable
and
especially
drinkable
for
7
5
the
beer
appears
extremely
hazy
and
pure
yellow
with
an
inch
of
soapy
white
head
the
aroma
is
simply
fabulous
dank
hops
and
farmhouse
funk
so
fresh
wow
great
flavor
as
well
beautiful
blend
of
nelson
hops
and
saison
character
a
healthy
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
back
finishing
dry
the
aroma
is
slightly
superior
to
the
flavor
but
the
beer
is
firing
on
all
cylinders
superb
mouthfeeloverall
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
and
carbonation
is
just
about
perfect
very
nice
mouthfeel
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
saison
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
heavy
white
pepper
and
spicy
sharpness
so
downgraded
it
a
bit
i
like
more
well
roundedness
out
of
my
saisons
but
i
definitely
still
enjoyed
it
sooo
good
pale
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
nearly
a
white
ale
with
a
generous
billowing
white
head
hops
and
yeast
dominate
the
nose
citrusy
nelson
sauvin
hops
and
spicy
notes
from
the
yeast
make
a
great
first
impression
first
taste
lives
up
to
the
smell
the
single
pale
malt
lets
the
hops
really
be
king
with
the
yeast
a
close
second
refreshing
citrus
and
pine
notes
are
nicely
complemented
by
hints
of
spice
and
funk
from
the
yeast
every
drink
is
as
good
as
the
one
before
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
virtues
of
simplicity
in
brewing
more
brewers
ought
to
follow
this
lead
simply
beautiful
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
paid
9
for
a
500ml
bottle
slightly
higher
than
i
think
is
justified
smells
is
appealing
and
very
herbal
on
the
nose
lots
of
lemon
zest
and
lemongrass
with
some
peppery
yeast
notes
smell
leads
nicely
into
the
taste
and
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
beer
tasting
close
to
the
nose
nice
tartness
with
lemon
and
grapefruit
bitterness
leading
into
the
herbal
lemongrass
and
peppery
yeast
notes
moderate
to
high
carbonation
lets
the
full
body
feel
nice
and
light
on
the
tongue
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
its
an
awesome
single
hop
saison
and
the
nelson
really
complements
the
malts
well
on
this
one
awesome
i
need
to
try
more
of
the
prairie
beers
yeat
prairie
farmhouse
overall
yet
another
solid
offering
from
prairie
amazing
that
this
only
single
malt
and
hop
easily
a
beer
to
seek
out
and
purchase
again
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
idea
of
one
hop
one
malt
and
one
yeast
is
awesome
if
this
was
available
in
nj
id
buy
it
on
the
regular
great
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
foaminess
and
not
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
although
its
pungent
nature
does
make
this
a
sipper
fantastic
i
love
this
brewery
this
beer
pours
out
a
very
light
golden
color
and
is
extremely
hazy
and
full
of
life
teaming
with
carbonation
it
has
one
nice
white
head
very
bubbly
at
first
but
then
it
dissipates
into
thins
bubbles
with
a
light
lacing
grapefruit
and
citrus
fruits
are
the
first
thing
to
hit
your
nose
followed
by
some
mild
malts
i
also
picked
up
some
mild
berry
aromas
as
well
its
light
and
crisp
up
front
and
is
semidry
its
tart
overall
and
the
citrus
fruits
reign
the
flavor
arena
it
gets
a
bit
drier
in
its
aftertaste
but
overall
is
pretty
smooth
and
very
refreshing
it
lighttomedium
bodied
and
really
hits
your
taste
buds
a
most
interesting
beer
one
malt
pilsner
one
hop
nelson
sauvin
and
prairies
pretty
funky
farmhouse
yeast
amazing
what
a
simple
bill
of
ingredients
can
do
the
nose
is
unbelievably
stinky
and
the
sauvin
hops
really
shine
as
well
highly
recommended
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
moderate
white
head
smells
of
bretty
funk
and
citrusy
hops
flavor
is
crackery
pils
malts
up
front
with
a
presence
of
brett
and
citrus
in
the
middle
finish
is
moderately
dry
and
slightly
tart
the
brett
and
citrus
from
the
hops
play
so
well
together
bitterness
shows
itself
but
isnt
overbearing
mouthfeel
is
highly
effervescent
but
with
a
solid
body
this
is
awesome
the
first
beer
from
prairie
that
has
truly
wowed
me
appears
cloudy
golden
peach
white
head
with
fine
speckled
around
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
tart
funky
yeast
bright
lemon
with
a
hint
of
band
aid
and
medicinal
quality
flavor
is
citric
lemony
with
grassy
hay
earthiness
medicinal
phenolics
a
bit
of
funky
band
aid
and
tangy
yogurt
notes
the
body
is
medium
with
flowing
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
bit
difficult
to
consume
mainly
due
to
the
intense
funky
house
yeast
they
are
using
on
the
prairie
o
the
most
satisfying
from
prarie
that
ive
tried
give
me
12
pack
of
this
in
cans
and
id
make
short
work
of
it
they
packed
a
ton
of
character
into
this
with
only
one
malt
and
one
hop
that
alone
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
do
very
much
enjoy
this
though
not
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
saisons
this
wonderful
little
brewery
has
to
offer
that
is
not
to
say
it
is
bad
at
all
and
very
much
recommended
pours
a
hazy
straw

capped
by
a
foamy
bright
white

little

no

notably

perhaps
some

with

bitter

heavier

brew
recommended
i
couldnt
help
myself
but
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
america
depending
on
what
history
book
you
read
with
opening
a
bottle
of
merica
this
is
clearly
an
american
take
on
a
belgian
style
big
thanks
to
blueokie
for
this
winner
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
combination
just
not
to
my
liking
personally
overall
these
prairie
guys
know
how
to
make
a
kick
ass
beer
hope
theyre
getting
the
props
they
deserve
in
the
beer
world
thanks
again
willandperry
o
very
nice
saison
that
has
lemon
and
citrus
notes
and
slight
sourness
o
yet
another
nice
farmhouse
which
i
would
have
again
o
the
aroma
on
this
is
very
nice
funky
juicy
earthy
just
what
i
like
in
a
saison
however
the
brett
and
dryness
dominates
the
flavor
a
bit
too
much
id
like
more
clove
citrus
sweetness
just
more
saison
flavors
in
general
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
after
having
a
few
of
their
other
offerings
light
body
with
just
a
touch
of
carbonation
enough
to
tickle
the
tongue
very
interesting
beer
with
the
brett
really
taking
over
the
aroma
and
flavor
if
you
dont
like
bretty
you
would
probably
hate
this
im
still
exploring
this
style
and
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
it
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
so
far
the
combination
of
pilsenerlike
flavors
up
front
and
musty
dryness
in
back
is
tough
to
beat
i
like
the
very
faint
funkiness
and
appreciate
that
it
contributes
to
rather
than
dominates
the
flavor
definitely
a
beer
worthy
of
repeated
visits
jd
if
you
like
em
sour
with
some
citrus
frills
youll
love
this
i
know
i
did
easily
my
favorite
in
this
lineup
a
homerun
in
my
books
pours
a
pale
orangish
yellow
straw
color
the
beer
is
quite
cloudy
the
head
puffs
up
into
quite
a
mass
at
first
but
it
proves
to
be
rather
fizzy
and
dissipates
quickly
pretty
much
no
bubbles
are
left
at
a
minute
and
theres
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
chock
full
of
nelson
sauvin
hops
its
wonderfully
and
fresh
and
juicy
im
getting
grape
melon
and
pineapple
flavors
primarily
with
peach
orange
lime
mint
mango
and
grass
adding
to
the
mix
its
a
tremendous
hop
aroma
underneath
all
of
that
hop
fruitiness
theres
a
touch
of
yeasty
earthy
funk
it
doesnt
hit
you
in
the
face
like
the
hops
but
the
beer
is
definitely
in
saisonfarmhouse
territory
when
you
look
for
the
yeast
flavors
just
a
touch
of
soft
honeyish
malt
the
taste
is
starts
off
with
sweet
fruitiness
and
more
of
that
honeyed
pale
malt
before
developing
a
firm
bitterness
of
lime
rind
lemongrapefruit
pith
and
earth
theres
a
spicy
herbal
edge
of
juniper
mint
peppercorns
and
earl
grey
bergamot
the
yeast
dries
out
the
beer
and
shows
off
some
of
that
funky
prairie
flavor
but
its
not
the
focus
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
celebration
of
the
nelson
sauvin
hop
i
absolutely
love
alpine
nelson
and
keene
idea
but
while
a
rather
different
take
merica
can
stand
with
those
beers
as
the
best
expression
of
the
hop
that
ive
tried
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
lots
of
hop
oiliness
the
finish
is
drying
and
the
bitterness
lingers
for
some
time
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
my
only
slight
knock
on
it
is
that
i
think
the
malt
flavor
could
use
a
little
tweak
maybe
a
touch
of
wheat
regardless
prairie
has
proven
themselves
as
a
brewery
to
watch
with
a
second
round
of
excellent
releases
im
thrilled
that
they
have
wide
distribution
and
look
forward
to
more
beers
from
them
prairie
has
been
kicking
out
some
fantastic
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
to
date
full
disclosure
i
was
a
redbud
cuvee
3
and
4
fanboy
so
i
call
in
before
the
hype
lol
seriously
though
i
strongly
recomend
this
and
or
any
other
things
theyve
been
doing
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
a
great
first
beer
from
ok
tart
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
are
made
for
saisons
but
prairie
gives
it
a
powderytart
taste
and
texture
that
seems
wood
aged
and
sour
blended
their
taste
reminds
me
of
anchorage
brewing
company
and
what
they
do
to
achieve
complexity
this
paired
very
well
with
spicy
artichoke
dip
8

a
showcase
for
nelson
sauvin
hops
to
be
sure
the
complexity
born
from
the
simplicity
of
a
smash
beer
is
pretty
amazing
that
said
i
guess
a
small
complaint
would
be
that
the
pungency
of
the
hops
completely
overwhelms
any
of
the
subtle
nuance
that
might
have
been
gained
from
the
floormalted
pils
still
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
another
great
effort
from
prairie
admittedly
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
saison
style
but
this
one
is
particularly
bad
in
my
opinion
tart
sour
finish
that
leaves
a
lingering
sour
aftertaste
i
have
stopped
buying
blue
moon
variety
packs
because
this
one
is
in
there
shame
too
sweet
for
my
liking
didnt
get
much
of
the
traditional
saisony
spice
admittedly
i
wasnt
feeling
good
about
this
one
due
to
the
brand
im
probably
in
the
minority
on
this
beer
but
i
liked
it
it
is
more
red
ale
than
farmhouse
to
me
but
that
might
explain
why
i
like
it
surprising
as
you
go
further
into
the
night
rating
for
this
beer
ok
great
beer
had
this
back
at
my
bday
in
the
summertime
good

didnt
like
this
one
one
of
my
favorites
well
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
and
i
got
what
i
expected
o
pretty
decent
for
a
large
brewer
worth
trying

that
effervesces
quite
well
on
the

the
flavor
profile
is
laid
back

has
a
well
balanced
complexity
it
begins
with
a
citrus
tartness
which
progresses
to
a
light
caramel
sweetness
on
the
crisp
finish
the
coriander
and
pepper
are
noted
along
with
a
touch

spicy

flavor
as
it
effervesces
a
good
solid

that
leaves
you
with
a
touch

spicy
heat
at
the
back

i
tried
the
expressionist
collection
farmhouse
red
it
has
hints
of
coriander
hibiscus
and
white
pepper
when
you
smell
this
beer
it
smells
a
little
like
cilantro
coriander
which
is
why
it
has
that
orangecitrusy
smell
i
loved
this
beer
the
flavors
were
delicious
and
it
was
just
an
easy
beer
to
drink
it
was
light
and
not
bitter
like
an
ipa
i
tried
but
no
thanks
i
went
to
my
local
liquor
store
and
my
buddy
who
owns
it
offered
me
a
12pk
for
7
99
just
on
the
price
alone
i
was
suspicious
but
having
drinks
earlier
in
the
day
i
figured
wat
the
hell
plus
ill
save
some
well
that
was
3weeks
ago
and
im
just
on
my
4th
beer
cant
drink
it
unless
im
buzzed
because
my
gag
reflex
arent
as
sensitive
overall
interesting
combination
of
flavors
but
not
a
beer
id
want
to
have
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thick
head
that
dies
to
nothing
and
leaves
no
lace
like
all
blue
moon
beers
smells
are
caramel
spice
orange
the
taste
follows
with
mostly
a
orange
spice
back
ground
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
slight
medium
overall
its
decent
and
i
would
have
no
issue
drinking
more
p
s
also
i
have
a
stomach
ache
from
14
of
this
beer
unbelievable
also
i
think
im
going
to
throw
my
cassanovas
pint
glass
away
cuz
it
tainted
it
so
much
ick
picked
up
a
blue
moon
variety
pack
for
a
quantity
over
quality
night
this
one
was
a
nice
little
surprise
decent
looking
beer
with
an
outstanding
smell
and
really
good
taste
enjoyed
it
a
good
bit
and
would
certainly
try
again
if
i
see
it
individually
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
this
is
not
really
bad
tasting
but
its
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
compared
to
actual
farmhouse
ales
from
the
12
oz
screwcap
bottle
purchased
at
litickers
liquors
in
ocean
beach
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
reddish
color
body
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
and
some
floral
hints
to
it
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
to
it
it
also
has
some
hop
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
it
is
good
nothing
to
over
the
top
overall
this
is
a
good
to
great
ale
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
that
rounds
the
experience
i
will
suggest
this
as
tasty
gettogether
drink
that
works
well
with
chicken
wings
i
really
really
like
this
beer
i
took
a
few
extra
sips
while
rating
it
just
so
i
can
taste
it
again
the
taste
mouthfeel
smell
is
all
in
perfect
ranges
i
strongly
suggest
this
to
anyone
even
to
a
not
often
beer
drinker
blue
moon
has
once
again
lived
up
to
their
expectations
i
got
this
in
the
sampler
pack
i
will
have
to
find
it
in
its
own
pack
and
purchase
the
hibiscus
flavor
is
strong
in
a
good
way
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
too
memorable
either
this
wont
satisfy
the
average
beer
geek
but
is
definitely
acceptable
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
this
may
be
something
id
introduce
if
i
were
trying
to
bring
someone
onto
the
craft
beer
bandwagon
cheers
for
the
4th
time
o
pretty
good
way
underrated
as
are
many
blue
moon
beers
dont
let
the
name
or
the
rating
discourage
you
its
less
than
2
dollars
a
bottle
and
well
worth
a
try
definitely
recommended
i
dont
fully
appreciate
saisons
ive
tried
a
few
and
been
underwhelmed
its
just
not
my
thing
so
ill
usually
pass
in
favor
of
something
darker
thicker
richer
but
today
i
stopped
at
a
cstore
and
this
short
straw
was
the
only
interesting
looking
beer
in
the
beer
cave
i
didnt
realize
what
style
it
was
supposed
to
be
until
i
got
it
home
working
through
this
6pack
im
thinking
its
refreshing
easy
going
and
happiness
producing
overall
id
suggest
that
what
the
folks
at
blue
moon
have
done
here
is
provided
a
gateway
brew
to
the
saison
style
a
flawed
attempt
at
the
style
but
drinks
pretty
easy
despite
that
this
would
still
be
the
best
beer
available
for
the
most
part
around
here
for
at
least
ten
miles
sigh
2950
overall
nice
price
point
but
nothing
else
entices
me
about
this
beer
had
this
in
the
winter
sampler
which
really
confused
me
as
this
is
definitely
not
a
winter
beer
has
a
hoppy
aroma
not
much
citrus
there
the
flavor
had
hints
of
citrus
and
the
white
pepper
with
the
hops
dominating
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
as
i
said
before
definitely
not
a
winter
beer
this
ale
has
a
reddish
brownish
look
small
head
aroma
of
sweet
roasted
nuts
bread
tate
is
light
in
all
areas
somewhat
tart
light
on
hops
malt
is
stronger
than
the
hops
and
stands
out
as
the
dominate
taste
fig
flat
dry
mouthfeel
not
much
else
stands
out
not
great
not
bad
this
one
confused
me
not
really
sure
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
didnt
really
have
the
character
of
a
red
ale
in
my
opinion
average
at
best
an
interesting
beer
from
coors
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
decent
head
and
decent
lacing
pick
up
some
light
breadiness
and
nuttiness
in
the
aroma
creamy
and
medium
bodied
malts
are
there
but
weak
and
i
get
some
tartness
hopping
is
there
but
not
prominant
and
there
is
also
some
toasted
character
and
finishes
dry
one
of
the
best
blue
moon
offerings
i
have
had
by
far
i
guess
it
comes
out
of
their
farmhouse
line
so
i
suppose
i
gotta
try
more
of
these
i
was
very
happy
with
its
redtinged
hue
its
distant
smell
of
sweetness
and
an
overall
great
tasting
beer
the
taste
is
just
off
too
sweet
thin
maltiness
that
is
overpowered
by
a
mucky
excuse
for
a
saison
yeast
very
unflatteringly
floral
like
sipping
on
cheap
perfume
mixed
with
beer
it
has
a
strange
offputting
burn
toward
the
finish
soppy
to
drink
with
a
restless
body
and
quaintly
wrapped
carbonation
presence
there
might
be
a
slight
tartness
thats
hard
to
pull
out
because
of
the
red
grain
push
and
offsetting
sweetness
hops
are
mildly
citrusy
with
a
gummi
grapefruit
note
that
absorbs
too
much
of
the
attention
doesnt
settle
entirely
too
well
overall
well
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
type
of
beer
and
i
actually
enjoyed
it
since
its
nice
to
have
something
different
once
in
a
while
o
if
i
didnt
know
before
hand
id
never
know
that
this
was
a
farmhouse
ale
no
traditional
flavors
of
the
style
i
did
pick
up
some
flanders
red
ale
characteristics
although
is
seemed
watered
down
pours
a
mostly
clear
deep
reddish
gold
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
aromas
of
light
sugar
spicy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
cherry
tartness
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
its
a
light
tart
spicy
beer
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
tart
mouthfeel
not
too
shabby
nothing
earth
shattering
but
pleasant
and
flavorful
enough
to
enjoy
o
i
think
perhaps
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
icecold
and
from
the
bottle
not
the
disaster
i
was
expecting
but
not
recommendable
rjt
taste
is
not
skittles
unfortunately
or
fortunately
for
some
sweet
malt
front
with
an
adequate
amount
of
spicing
that
follows
up
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
but
closer
to
the
middle
range
body
is
slightly
lacking
hint
of
a
peppery
finish
not
overly
sweet
like
i
had
initially
expected
to
good
health
and
good
beer
o
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
its
flat
out
just
a
very
mediocre
beer
overall
o
very
middle
of
the
road
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
while
doing
yard
work
nothing
really
outstanding
about
it
but
it
was
not
bad
o
overall
this
is
a
beer
worth
the
money
if
you
decide
to
just
close
your
eyes
shut
out
all
aspects
of
what
you
might
expect
from
its
title
and
enjoy
yes
it
could
be
a
better
beer
but
it
isnt
a
bad
one
and
for
that
hats
off
to
coors
kidding
overall
this
one
is
ok
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
with
a
reddishgolden
hue
quickly
fading
white
head
the
aroma
is
faint
straw
wheat
the
flavor
profile
is
weak
tasteless
it
does
not
have
any
flavors
of
a
saison
or
flanders
red
the
body
is
light
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
taste
like
a
light
wheat
beer
avoid
it
overall
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
good
example
of
the
style
which
is
fine
by
me
as
i
dont
enjoy
the
pepper
flavors
associated
with
a
saison
a
decent
enough
beer
that
i
might
try
again
drinkable
but
wouldnt
buy
it
it
was
a
gift
from
a
party
guest
which
thought
i
might
like
it
since
i
like
craft
beer
pours
a
clear
orangered
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
yeast
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
i
am
not
getting
any
sort
of
the
flanders
red
aspect
that
this
is
supposed
to
have
o
decent
red
ale
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
would
make
a
great
new
substitution
for
the
current
coors
recipe
but
as
mixture
of
saison
and
flanders
red
this
beer
falls
way
short
of
being
even
remotely
close
to
either
style
o
surprised
and
happy
that
coors
could
pull
this
off
deviates
from
most
other
saisons
ive
had
in
a
good
way
some
might
call
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
opposed
to
dryer
notes
an
easy
way
to
make
a
refreshing
saison
i
say
why
not
i
dont
see
this
variety
in
stores
much
but
when
the
weather
calls
for
it
again
ill
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
this
great
valued
and
refreshing
beer
overall
forget
it
i
tasted
and
tried
a
few
times
and
even
put
the
flanders
thing
out
of
my
head
i
just
tried
to
accept
it
at
beer
it
was
full
of
lies
original
blue
moon
is
fine
with
me
ill
gladly
drink
it
over
numerous
other
beers
in
certain
situations
but
this
what
were
they
thinking
im
actually
a
bit
annoyed
they
put
the
term
flanders
red
or
even
farmhouse
red
anywhere
on
the
bottle
another
in
the
expressionist
series
and
this
one
has
a
bit
more
character
than
most
blue
moons
chaff
but
not
sweet
or
hoppy

very
different
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
the
smell
is
great
the
taste
is
done
what
like
a
hefeweizen
without
the
wheat
taste
however
slightly
too
much
citrus
for
my
taste
still
excellent
beer
bright
gold
and
clear
citrus
aroma
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
apple
and
belgian
yeast
medium
body
great
saison
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
virtually
no
head
lacing
is
minimal
has
the
typical
farmhouse
aroma
taste
of
belgium
yeasts
with
a
bitterness
at
the
end
very
bready
decent
saison
but
not
among
my
favorites
there
is
something
off
with
the
aftertaste
overeall
iv
been
on
a
streak
with
great
beers
this
winter
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
i
saw
that
it
was
4
99
and
figured
i
couldnt
go
wrong
i
admit
im
not
a
big
fan
of
saisonsfarmhouse
ales
but
i
found
brooklyn
sorachi
ace
and
ommegang
hennepin
to
be
a
lot
better
i
think
its
the
yeast
strain
in
this
that
turned
me
off
a
bit
victory
is
normally
excellent
but
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
iv
had
from
them
and
most
likely
wont
return
my
only
question
does
it
need
to
be
7
5
could
it
be
the
same
beer
or
nearly
at
say
6
picked
this
one
up
at
the
farmers
market
really
nice
hodgepodge
of
spices
and
citrus
my
only
complaint
may
be
a
little
too
much
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
it
would
hold
its
own
against
other
farmhouse
ales
that
cost
double
the
price
my
take
away
which
is
quite
surprising
is
that
this
beer
sums
up
my
experience
of
the
2010
infected
matilda
i
had
which
had
more
of
a
reddish
hue
to
it
with
a
greater
head
retention
as
it
warms
from
the
30sf
it
gets
much
funkier
i
am
very
impressed
and
would
certainly
buy
several
more
bombers
of
this
for
the
price
point
of
4
99
its
a
steal
folks
and
very
well
executed
f
lots
of
things
happening
and
it
just
doesnt
blend
together
overall
this
beer
has
it
going
on
its
the
best
saison
ive
had
to
date
go
get
it
now
found
this
in
the
basement
was
not
fresh
opened
the
bottle
and
it
gushed
super
funky
nose
more
malt
complexity
than
i
remember
intensely
tart
lemon
and
hay
flavors
mixed
with
some
pepper
and
layers
of
base
malts
brett
is
there
in
full
force
really
enjoying
this
one
surprised
how
well
this
evolved
considering
it
was
over
two
years
past
the
enjoy
by
date
wish
i
didnt
lose
half
the
bottle
but
i
should
have
known
it
may
be
a
gusher
taste
shows
the
good
yeasthop
relationship
again
in
the
flavor
i
really
like
the
aggressive
hop
flavor
with
the
lightly
tart
fruity
yeast
malts
still
could
use
a
defter
touch
i
think
and
just
let
the
yeast
and
hops
do
their
thing
but
as
it
is
they
add
a
little
sweetness
that
is
not
altogether
unpleasant
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
made
saisons
very
good
brew
080813
from
bottle
surprisingly
different
from
the
victory
sunrise
weiss
this
is
much
more
robust
spicy
very
assertive
yet
enjoyable
ever
have
a
very
big
friend
the
kind
that
almost
scares
people
that
dont
know
him
this
is
like
that
guy
a
gentle
giant
as
it
were
make
room
o
this
one
flies
under
the
radar
where
else
can
you
find
a
22oz
7
5
abv
brett
saison
for
around
the
56
mark
per
bottle
perhaps
one
of
the
best
value
buys
out
there
if
youre
new
to
brett
go
to
school
with
this
beer
it
certainly
isnt
the
epitome
of
the
style
but
its
simple
pleasanteasily
crushable
and
a
good
introduction
to
the
world
of
brettanomyces
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
bottle
kicked
around
for
a
year
or
two
brett
tends
to
dry
out
and
funk
up
a
beer
with
time
so
this
may
be
quite
a
different
experience
when
fresh
o
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
brett
but
id
pass
if
you
dont
o
i
didnt
detract
too
much
for
the
end
taste
given
i
cant
account
for
the
freshness
of
the
beer
assuming
age
is
the
cause
i
believe
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
quite
well
fresh
even
though
saisons
are
not

pretty
nice
saison
and
a
good
bang
for
your
buck
o
this
is
generally
a
very
good
beer
i
think
the
yeast
let
loose
a
few
rogue
elements
that
detract
slightly
but
i
still
found
the
beer
both
approachable
and
enjoyable
pours
a
hazy
yellow
honey
color
with
a
foamy
sticky
white
head
on
the
surface
aroma
is
filled
with

barnyard
funk
soft
pale

and
some
black

with
much
less

peppery
spice

lemony

and
subtle
malt
dry
snappy
medium

very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
an
underappreciated
underrated
bargain
of
a
saison
from
victory
this
is
a
great
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
saison
decent
amount
of
sour
and

to
drink
recommend
serving
at

very

victory
always
seems
to
know
exactly
what
theyre
doing
o
i
like
this
great

ratio
as
stated
very
refreshing
is
a
nicely

brew
probably
wont
have
again
maybe
worth
trying
if
you
are
into

o

take
on

character
this
is
my
first
time
having
it
since
the
rebranding
from
vsaison
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
a
tasty
little
brett
saison
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
likely
pick
up
first
and
that
fact
is
only
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
victory
is
not
easy
to
procure
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
still
a
solid
offering
and
if
it
was
local
and
easy
to
get
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
beer
to
grab
regularly
to
get
that
brett
fix
when
some
of
my
favorites
which
are
usually
seasonal
limited
release
or
out
of
my
distro
area
arent
available
overall
a
decent
saison
but
not
one
of
the
best
personally
i
think
its
worth
getting
this
beer
at
least
once
22

into

a
very

offering
overall
for
4
50
a
bomber
this
is
great
im
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
but
imagine
its
not
fresh
still
tasty
and
drinkable
probably
a
good
saison
for
those
new
to
the
style
othe
balance
is
off
the
bubblegum
flavor
throws
stuff
off
expected
better
from
victory
i
bought
this
beer
10
months
ago
and
was
concerned
it
might
be
at
the
end
of
its
best
days
i
dont
think
that
was
an
accurate
thought
good
stuff
o
for
a
4
bomber
this
is
really
nice
saison
this
is
definitely
one
that
you
might
try
introducing
to
a
new
saison
beer
drinker
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
like
a
little
more
balance
between
spice
and
citrus
in
saisons
whereas
this
beer
seems
pretty
tilted
towards
the
citrus
but
still
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
and
at
a
great
price
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sharpmedicinal
for
my
tastes
but
a
good
complex
flavor
great
price
as
well
you
can
taste
the
7
5
in
this
saison
summer
style
ale
lingering
alcohol
finish
but
quite
not
as
noticeable
upfront
with
the
other
omplex
bright
flavors
present
o
if
its
summer
this
is
in
my
refrigerator
at
40case
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
which
stands
up
nicely
to
most
dinner
fare
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
modestly
carbonated
for
7
5
it
has
a
mild
hint
of
alcohol
but
is
otherwise
hidden
quite
well
very
nice
drinkability
and
complexity
for
a
saison
at
34
bucks
a
bomber
you
just
cant
beat
this
if
you
havent
already
had
this
what
the
hell
are
you
waiting
for
ill
buy
this
again
very
decent
very
drinkable
this
beer
intrigued
me
because
it
came
in
at
a
super
low
price
for
a
bomber
but
unfortunately
did
not
deliver
in
the
taste
something
about
it
did
not
set
well
with
my
palate
and
i
cant
recommend
it
o
when
i
first
had
this
years
ago
i
straight
up
did
not
like
it
and
now
that
my
nose
and
palate
are
both
more
accustomed
to
saisons
its
still
not
amazing
but
i
appreciate
the
nuances
and
drinkability
the
more
things
change
the
more
they
stay
the
same
kind
of
pours
brilliant
gold
yellow
bottom
orange
top
white
foam
cap
sunny
malty
nose
very
modest
yeasty
taste
some
funkiness
pushy
bitter
that
hangs
around
lemon
peel
very
rindy
lots
going
on
in
here
beautiful
looking
with
a
very
good
taste
for
the
price
to
abv
and
taste
ratio
this
beer
cannot
be
beat
its
an
odd
beer
a
filtered
saison
pouring
pale
straw
in
color
with
golden
tones
and
a
massive
white
head
fluffy
and
rising
well
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
surprisingly
funky
especially
after
tasting
their
very
lackluster
swing
saison
this
one
has
som
nice
lemony
tartness
to
it
mouthwatering
the
flavor
is
very
light
very
summer
grassy
notes
fresh
and
way
more
farmy
than
i
gave
it
initial
credit
for
some
pepper
in
the
yeast
too
although
also
light
the
grain
bill
is
respectably
simple
and
the
finish
on
this
is
nice
and
dry
one
would
never
know
its
alcoholic
strength
either
but
why
7
5
i
wonder
it
seems
like
itd
make
a
great
session
summer
beer
at
5
but
with
the
alcohol
amped
up
as
high
as
it
is
i
cant
quite
figure
out
this
beers
true
identity
clean
finish
and
lighter
body
because
its
been
filtered
clear
carbonation
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
i
have
very
little
to
complain
about
here
this
is
a
lovely
beer
from
victory
and
full
redemption
for
that
sub
par
summer
session
saison
they
did
this
year
under
5
bucks
a
bomber
is
a
steal
for
a
beer
this
good
o
this
is
the
hop
stoopid
of
saisons
why
do
i
say
that
because
its
a
highquality
no
frills
interpretation
of
the
style
fantastically
priced
by
bomber
standards
that
and
victory
could
really
stand
to
put
this
in
6
packs
still
a
really
good
saison
regardless
overall
this
is
a
unique
saison
although
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
my
favorite
the
pepper
gets
to
be
a
little
too
much
and
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
mouthfeel
overall
really
fantastic
at
around
4
its
going
to
be
a
frequent
get
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
pleasing
malty
character
that
is
quickly
overtaken
and
succeeded
by
a
low
but
pungent
citrus
bitterness
i
found
this
to
be
fairly
easy
to
drink
oa
nice
saison
at
a
great
price
great
summer
beer
very
enjoyable
od
a
very
good
saison
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
more
in
the
summer
a
rather
funky
one
which
i
think
is
more
true
to
the
style
vs
todays
lab
clean
versions
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spices
and
brett
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
crisp
brett
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
great
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
super
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
american
saison
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
in
the
summer
great
pickup
to
for
3
79
much
less
than
the
old
corked
v
would
buy
this
one
again
decent
saison
but
fairly
generic
this
ale
from
victory
is
a
fresh
one
the
look
is
clear
and
golden
with
white
head
and
a
good
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
zesty
with
citrus
and
i
feel
like
i
am
detecting
a
honey
sweet
fragrance
the
taste
is
fresh
and
crisp
with
citrus
flavors
this
helios
has
an
oddness
about
it
that
is
different
from
anything
i
have
ever
tasted
they
nailed
the
summery
fresh
zesty
beer
thing
but
there
are
some
slight
flavors
in
the
background
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
those
flavors
bring
a
uniqueness
to
this
beer
that
i
didnt
expect
because
of
that
i
think
you
should
pick
one
up
if
you
see
it
personal
rate
3
75
o
incredibly
funky
fruity
and
refreshing
drinkable
dry
farmhouse
ale
thats
one
of
the
best
readily
available
saisons
at
a
tremendous
value
the
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
gusher
with
a
formidable
white
head
the
aroma
offers
citrus
hops
brett
etc
very
nice
flavor
follows
suit
light
to
medium
in
body
and
highly
drinkinable
delicious
4
per
bomber
alrighty
then
absolutely
worth
a
try
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
one
pours
a
golden
yellow
in
the
glass
with
good
carbonation
carbonation
is
finer
small
bubbles
and
a
layer
remains
on
top
of
the
beer
through
consumption
good
lacing
nose
is
floral
like
a
fresh
field
of
flowers
taste
is
also
fresh
and
refreshing
has
body
yet
still
light
again
very
floral
but
also
spices
like
rosemarie
and
thyme
floral
flavor
lingers
well
after
the
finish
o
a
nice
saison
if
a
bit
on
the
dry
crisp
end
of
the
curve
at
3
79
bomber
very
sessionable
and
i
could
imagine
knocking
back
several
of
these
on
a
hot
day
o
a
nice
saison
from
victory
decently
complex
and
highly
drinkable
especially
for
7
5
at
a
great
price
point
3
49
moreso
recommended
for
the
summer
months
but
even
in
the
winter
its
not
bad
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
qualitys
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
with
some
nice
complexity
while
being
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
was
refreshing
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
i
could
see
this
being
a
great
choice
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
i
think
a
bomber
would
be
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
the
brett
gave
it
the
earthy
and
slightly
funky
aspect
that
really
tied
everything
together
and
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
as
can
happen
easily
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
comes
in
bomber
this
is
the
perfect
candidate
for
12oz
bottles
a
six
pack
would
be
great
to
have
during
those
hot
summer
days
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
ill
probably
wait
till
the
summer
to
revisit
it
it
wasnt
too
expensive
and
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
and
it
might
make
for
a
good
and
easy
introduction
to
brett
beers
all
in
all
this
beer
delivered
just
what
i
wanted
from
this
style
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
solid
saison
so
far
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
victory
and
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
tried
good
job
guys
ill
have
to
try
a
couple
more
of
your
beers
o
a
welldone
beer
for
its
style
but
the
hopiness
and
lemony
taste
made
it
less
appealing
for
me
there
are
other
saisons
id
prefer
o
enjoyable
and
strong
enough
that
one
bottle
gets
me
there
relatively
affordable
too
it
was
light
and
had
enough
flavor
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
brewing
my
own
was
going
to
work
better
with
the
bomber
and
i
found
that
trying
out
other
the
brews
inspired
me
to
make
something
better
or
equal
i
was
inspired
to
try
out
a
light
brew
next
batch
nice
on
all
counts
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
has
some
lovely
rustic
earthy
and
dependable
flavours
to
it
but
manages
to
amalgamate
them
all
into
a
clean
very
drinkable
beer
good
stuff
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
one
pale
strawyellow
pour
mostly
clear
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
retained
well
and
left
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
mixture
of
sweet
and
funky
on
the
nose
with
a
promise
of
earthiness
taste
was
interesting
lightly
toasted
grains
yeast
musty
grass
a
little
thin
overall
and
just
doesnt
deliver
what
i
like
in
the
style
light
body
and
fairly
drinkable
if
you
like
saisons
but
not
something
id
go
for
again
o
very
good
for
a
saison
actually
i
have
never
had
a
bad
saison
all
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
are
consistent
with
what
this
type
of
beer
is
suppose
to
be
its
hard
to
overlook
this
beer
considering
the
price
at
most
packies
overall
not
sure
if
this
is
made
with
brett
no
mention
but
i
get
some
nice
brett
notes
out
of
it
nice
belgian
and
a
great
bargain
at
5
a
bomber
o
awesome
beer
only
2
99
for
the
22
oz
bottle
poured
from
a
growler
that
was
a
few
days
old
the
head
was
a
little
flat
but
that
expected
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
tantilzaing
smell
classic
belgian
sasion
taste
that
i
would
describe
as
dry
bright
lemony
with
slight
spice
notes
overall
a
delicious
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
very
floral
scent
really
worked
for
this
one
up
until
i
tasted
it
and
it
tasted
like
i
was
eating
a
bouquet
im
sure
theres
people
out
there
that
will
like
it
i
do
not
still
a
pretty
refreshing
ale
nonetheless
and
a
very
unique
saison
a
very
nice
saison
one
that
has
a
slight
brett
character
that
is
not
overwhelming
but
very
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
drinkability
very
nice
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
poured
into
a
snifter
this
ale
pours
brilliantly
clear
straw
color
with
a
medium
bright
white
head
that
quickly
diminished
the
aroma
is
moderately
peppery
slightly
spicy
and
citrusy
and
some
earthiness
almost
cilantrolike
the
flavor
is
rather
peppery
and
spicy
up
front
with
a
dry
winelike
finish
with
a
mediumlow
hop
bitterness
simple
yet
complex
and
interesting
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
and
body
moderate
overall
a
well
made
tasty
brew
worth
a
try
deep
yellow
with
a
hint
of
amber
and
near

with
a

that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy

orange

aroma
with
a
hint

and
hints

aggressive

funky

flavor
from

with

into

from

and
once

the
funky

at

finshes
with
a
lingering
yeasty
funt
aftertaste
this
is
a
fairly
subdued
saison
but
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
personally
i
enjoy
saisons
but
find
drinking
several
to
be
difficult
the
funkiness
tends
to
wear
down
my
tastebuds
but
the
yards
saison
was
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
cant
believe
its
taken
me
this
long
to
try
it
the
brett
was
light
and
not
dominating
but
really
made
the
beer
for
me
with
its
complex
flavors
at
3
99
a
bomber
i
thought
this
was
a
great
value
as
well
one
of
the
best
light
and
easy
drinking
beers
ive
had
all
summer
o
a
very
nice
and
tasty
saison
victroy
makes
a
great
saison
at
a
great
price
definitely
will
be
picking
this
up
again
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
pretty
pleasant
saison
o
a
higher
degree
of
attenuation
or
less
residual
sweetness
would
have
elevated
helios
from
very
good
to
excellent
nonetheless
this
is
an
upper
echelon
americanmade
saison
that
said
it
does
a
decent
enough
job
to
pair
with
a
spicy
meal
and
thats
all
i
need
it
to
id
give
it
average
marks
overall
not
a
bad
saison
the
nose
was
quite
nice
but
the
flavor
loses
a
bit
of
balance
o
i
wish
this
saison
had
a
bit
more
going
for
it
than
just
lemon
character
make
it
more
potent
make
it
sour
o
very
drinkable
but
somewhat
dull
and
not
sharp
on
flavors
this
beer
smells
like
an
outhouse
or
baby
diaper
even
took
a
survey
to
those
around
me
and
they
agreed
it
tastes
beeter
than
what
it
smells
like
when
not
smelling
it
it
tastes
more
like
a
sour
beer
not
a
fan
had
it
churchky
in
dc
for
2
5
a
4oz
i
wouldnt
drink
it
for
free
taste
is
nice
juicy
lemonherbclove
with
light
fruity
raisinypear
sweetness
and
lemonyherbpeppery
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
pine
resin
it
has
a
nice
wellrounded
character
and
feel
pretty
tasty
beer
sweet
but
not
overwhelming
and
pretty
clean
not
much
i
can
say
negative
about
this
offering
from
victory
o
pretty
decent
saison
and
a
great
value
at
4
a
bomber
but
too
sweet
initially
and
too
bitter
on
the
finish
to
be
very
good
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
and
good
for
the
price
4
49
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
a
fairly
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
and
overall
mouthfeel
finish
is
semidry
a
good
slightly
funky
brew
that
is
almost
bpa
i
find
this
a
bit
too
bitter
and
phenolic
to
be
great
but
it
is
quite
good
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
thirst
quenching
has
plenty
citrus
and
tons
spice
its
super
easy
drinking
and
that
helps
make
for
some
what
average
complexity
in
terms
of
value
its
freaking
home
run
at
3
49
a
bomber
at
great
price
certainly
worth
try
for
decent
though
not
great
beer
of
style
overall
some
flavors
are
good
some
flavors
are
off
not
a
drainpour
but
not
anything
i
want
to
drink
again
so
im
reading
the
back
of
the
bottle
and
they
say
it
is
orange
hued
compared
to
bud
light
sure
but
pretty
much
a
dark
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
pour
this
one
slowly
im
pouring
it
into
a
frozen
pint
glass
nice
and
carefully
and
im
getting
a
lot
of
head
and
about
1
5
inches
of
beer
which
subsides
but
leaves
a
nice
fine
thin
head
that
persists
throughout
the
whole
experience
i
see
all
these
comments
on
lacing
and
yeah
its
got
it
but
who
cares
so
lets
get
onto
the
smell
i
saw
another
poster
and
they
were
getting
hints
of
band
aid
i
think
thats
on
the
mark
and
may
be
a
product
of
this
type
of
yeast
yeah
its
there
but
dont
let
that
turn
you
off
its
band
aid
good
in
a
way
the
smell
of
gasoline
or
a
new
shower
curtain
is
good
am
i
right
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
but
its
better
than
just
drinkable
i
just
tasted
a
dash
of
white
pepper
and
there
isnt
any
in
here
there
is
nothing
earthy
here
all
sky
from
the
big
bubbles
on
the
palate
to
the
lemons
in
the
tree
with
more
meyer
sweetness
than
eureka
sourness
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
even
the
taste
of
the
belches
afterward
i
suppose
ill
have
to
get
more
schooled
in
this
style
but
id
grab
another
one
of
these
especially
since
the
price
is
so
right
i
love
hopdevil
so
im
looking
forward
to
more
of
victorys
brews
d
a
wellmade
saison
from
victory
i
really
dig
that
an
offering
of
this
quality
is
so
cheap
i
believe
i
got
this
bomber
for
4
which
is
definitely
one
of
the
cheapest
saisons
ive
had
good
shit
overall
a
touch
sweet
in
flavor
for
a
saison
but
there
are
some
drying
qualities
and
light
touch
of
yeastiness
its
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
but
not
a
down
the
line
saison
o
fresh
light
zesty
a
decent
sipper
overall
for
the
most
part
it
is
really
quite
a
fantastic
brew
with
many
great
characteristics
unfortunately
the
after
taste
that
it
leaves
in
the
mouth
really
takes
away
from
the
overall
enjoyableness
of
drinking
the
brew
i
call
this
one
a
cellaring
success
if
i
were
to
spend
the
money
to
do
it
again
i
would
sample
at
about
10
months
to
see
if
i
could
get
slightly
more
brightness
out
of
it
while
still
preserving
my
beloved
funk
levels
but
as
it
is
i
still
enjoyed
it
immensely
at
13
months
so
if
you
like
to
amplify
saison
funk
levels
in
your
basement
like
i
do
i
can
tell
you
that
it
does
work
properly
with
this
particular
brew
o
a
pleasant
surprise
given
the
unappealing
aroma
saisons
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
would
consider
a
few
of
these
while
sitting
on
the
patio
after
cutting
the
grass
o
this
is
a
good
beer
while
it
differs
with
regards
to
other
saisons
its
still
nice
i
would
put
this
in
the
bpa
category
either
this
was
mishandled
or
something
has
gone
seriously
awry
my
recollection
of
this
beer
from
an
earlier
unreviewed
tasting
was
more
favorable
a
solid
saison
that
can
get
a
touch
overbearing
at
times
not
as
drinkable
as
it
should
be
with
all
the
yeastiness
and
prickly
feel
but
still
compares
ok
against
others
o
for
4
this
is
quite
a
bargain
even
if
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
i
still
cant
fully
describe
though
one
day
ill
have
a
better
palate
for
this
style
of
beer
o
it
isnt
the
best
saison
out
there
but
it
is
very
good
helios
is
one
of
my
go
to
bombers
because
it
is
always
available
cheap
and
comes
in
a
style
that
is
usually
more
difficult
to
find
saison
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
the
fact
that
i
can
run
to
the
grocery
store
and
grab
a
bomber
of
helios
for
half
the
price
of
inferior
saisons
is
very
nice
o
this
is
my
first
real
experience
with
a
farmhouse
and
while
it
wasnt
a
bad
experience
im
going
to
have
to
bone
up
on
these
to
really
appreciate
them
overall
though
this
is
what
i
expected
from
this
style
this
is
a
great
enjoyable
saison
mix
of
interesting
characters
of
density
brightness
fruit
funk
hint
of
sweet
just
great
overall
a
really
pleasant
surprise
this
beer
really
impresses
right
now
definately
worth
a
try
and
probably
more
than
once
odfor
just
under
3
a
bomber
this
is
an
incredible
deal
i
have
had
12
saisons
that
arent
as
good
as
this
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
funktart
aspect
of
this
beer
enjoyable
and
probably
my
favorite
victory
beer
to
me
this
beer
is
an
underrated
gem
the
money
value
here
is
exceptional
literally
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
recently
had
for
a
quarter
of
the
cost
of
some
of
the
overseas
versions
of
the
style
much
better
than
i
expected
overall
this
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
saison
but
i
find
the
nose
to
be
quite
offensive
o
not
typically
my
first
choice
of
style
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
depth
in
flavor
and
maybe
some
sort
of
fruitiness
which
i
simply
didnt
get
at
all
o
good
take
on
the
style
for
an
american
if
this
one
is
around
for
the
summer
ill
buy
the
hell
out
of
it
recommended
a
tad
sour
and
sweet
apple
with
a
clear
nod
to
citrus
flavors
of
lemon
and
lime
with
an
herbal
flavor
there
is
also
a
touch
of
spice
perhaps
black
pepper
mixed
in
as
well
the
hop
snap
on
the
finish
is
equally
as
spicy
i
have
to
thank
victory
for
introducing
me
to
a
new
style
and
for
making
it
affordable
i
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
bottles
and
explore
a
few
other
saison
options
overall
not
the
absolute
best
siason
its
that
pink
lemonaid
middle
dragging
it
down
but
its
fairly
close
and
as
a
budget
minded
foodie
who
really
loves
pairing
beer
with
food
absolutely
nothing
can
beat
this
at
3
conclusion
i
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
fresh
and
the
age
hasnt
hurt
it
much
so
i
am
giving
my
aged
bottled
generous
ratings
based
on
how
the
beer
is
fresh
i
cant
ding
the
brewer
for
their
beer
not
aging
perfectly
when
they
didnt
intend
for
it
to
be
aged
i
am
glad
for
the
experiment
and
the
enhanced
brett
qualities
are
very
enjoyable
if
you
like
dry
brettinfluenced
flavors
think
aged
orval
stick
one
of
these
in
your
cellar
for
a
few
years
just
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
swirl
out
some
of
the
excessive
carbonation
before
making
a
final
judgement
dr
its
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
abv
id
like
to
try
this
on
draught
this
makes
me
excited
to
try
more
beers
from
victory
in
the
future

this
is
a
very
very
solid
saison
it
may
be
relatively
run
of
the
mill
in
some
ways
but
it
nails
the
style
in
the
process
this
would
be
an
excellent
introduction
to
saisons
to
anyone
interested
in
trying
the
style
thanks
victory
for
making

an
accessible

22oz
bottle

99
i
bought
this
because
it
was
cheap
and
i
heard
it
had
brettanomyces
i
was
thoroughly
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
it
i
poured
this
into
a
wine
glass
and
it
had
a
bright
yelloworange
color
and
a
great
head
looks
nice
the
smell
was
heavy
brett
funk
hay
farm
and
a
dash
of
lemons
i
sniffed
it
for
quite
awhile
before
taking
the
first
sip
great
aroma
the
flavor
was
pretty
good
as
well
heavy
brett
yeast
flavor
and
a
distinct
citrus
flavor
this
reminded
me
of
boulevard
saison
brett
but
at
a
third
of
the
price
ill
be
buying
a
bunch
more
overall
impression
a
bit
too
sour
for
the
sour
at
the
finish
has
a
oldstale
grapefruit
taste
that
is
hard
to
enjoy
or
get
through
i
finished
the
entire
bottle
but
this
really
made
me
think
huh
this
one
started
great
and
then
finished
average
i
would
still
recommend
anyone
trying
this
one
but
there
are
many
other
saisons
before
this
one
i
would
enjoy
overall
a
decent
farmhouse
wish
it
was
a
little
less
bitter
though
an
interesting
approach
to
the
style
ultimately
there
are
other
saisons
id
rather
have
when
you
smell
this
beer
you
expect
much
more
from
the
taste
pleasant
enough
though
for
sitting
outside
on
my
porch
enjoying
the
cool
florida
weather
do
not
get
me
wrong
i
do
recommend
it
but
you
need
to
expect
that
this
beer
is
heavy
in
alcohol
wow
reviews
seem
all
over
the
place
on
this
one

far

as
well
as

taste
follows
suit
with
more
peppery

just
a

youll
like
it
o
people
talk
about
a
funk
in
these
beers
but
i
just
dont
taste
it
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
it
didnt
quite
reach
fantastic
for
me
poured
from
a

into
a

the
beer
pours

vibrant
honeygold

with
a
thin
film
of
bright
white
good
cling
along
the
glass
as
you
drink
aromas
are

strong

component
some

and
some

highlights
flavors
are
syrupy
sweet
initially
with
a
clove
spicing
joined
by
ginger
and
cinnamon
there
is
a
roasted
background
with
some
honey
flavors
and
an
almost
mead
quality
as
well
aftertaste
has
a
slight
linger
to
it
with
an
effervescent
old
world
fruit
sweetness
and
slight
yeast
sourness
the
finish
is
light
and
dries
slightly
as
your
palate
clears
o
im
still
feeling
out
the
world
of
saisons
but
i
trusted
victory
and
they
have
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
o
its
mediocre
by
saison
standards
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
they
dont
mesh
perfectly
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
ill
probably
grab
a
different
saison
in
the
future
jd
overall
at
3
dollars
for
a
bomber
you
cant
go
wrong
it
only
slightly
goes
off
the
path
of
a
true
saison
but
still
a
very
well
drank
beer
o
this
beer
is
really
quite
good
its
complex
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
its
one
of
the
best
saisons
that
ive
had
imo
its
a
bit
dry
to
be
world
class
at
2
99
a
bomber
this
is
a
steal
d
at
7
5
abv
where
you
can
actually
feel
the
alcohol
burn
this
unfortunately
isnt
that
drinkable
due
to
that
however
the
beer
is
defiantly
above
average
i
really
enjoy
this
one
overall
very
nice
but
not
a
great
example
of
a
saison
as
it
seems
a
touch
too
sweet
and
full
a
decent
saison
with
the
brightness
of
the
american
examples
like
la
merle
but
without
the
classic
dry
hoppiness
of
dupont
the
beer
is
an
attractive
cloudy
shade
of
yellow
decent
carbonated
head
with
excellent
retention
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
yeasty
earthy
funk
with
banana
pineapple
lemon
coriander
the
taste
is
fresh
and
fruity
albeit
a
little
grassy
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
finish
very
refreshing
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
worth
a
try
for
saison
or
belgina
lovers
overall
well
lots
of
flavor
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
man
its
cheap
a
great
example
of
the
style
only
drawback
is
it
does
get
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
of
each
drink
other
then
that
what
a
great
deal
and
a
great
beer
o
for
3
0022oz
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
deals
on
the
market
anyone
that
loves
saisons
should
give
this
one
a
try
its
a
nobrainer
sweet
spicey
fruity
sharp
tart
and
full
of
flavor
very
easy
drinking

a
clear
golden

which
leaves
behind
frothy

head
and
heaps
of
clingy

citrus
and
some

and
has
tastes
of
spicy
hopslemon

rindbarnyard
funkcandy
and
is
finished
with
a
mix
of
sherbet
and
pepper
and
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
the
greatest
saison
out
there
and
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
again
any
day
soon
but
it
tastes
nice
enough
and
if
offered
wouldnt
knock
it
back
cheers
o
its
amazing
how
palettes
change
over
time
i
had
this
beer
several
months
ago
and
thought
it
was
great
now
i
feel
as
though
its
fairly
bland
and
noncomplex
as
the
style
can
be
if
anything
it
reminds
me
of
a
drie
fonteinen
oude
geuze
accept
not
aged
in
barrels
or
with
a
wild
funk
this
is
ok
and
also
one
of
the
cheapest
bombers
available
for
the
price
point
its
a
quality
brew
o
not
bad
lacks
a
bit
of
the
complexity
ive
come
to
expect
for
the
style
but
immensely
drinkable
and
a
good
price
at
2
99
for
a
bomber
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
o
a
pretty
nice
domestic
saison
i
gave
it
a
4
5
overall
because
at
3
99
a
bomber
with
a
long
shelf
life
you
really
cant
go
wrong
overall
this
is
a
fairly
unique
saison
the
grassy
finish
is
borderline
and
it
is
gonna
keep
me
away
from
getting
this
one
again
from
a
bottle
pours
clear
gold
with
a
puffy
white
head
nose
is
grassy
saison
yeast
fresh
hops
some
corianderlike
spices
and
citrus
rind
mouth
is
an
interesting
montage
of
fresh
hops
citrus
fruit
and
belgian
saison
yeasts
bright
and
fresh
moderate
bitterness
throughout
especially
on
the
back
end
where
it
lingers
a
bit
an
interesting
take
on
a
saison
and
certainly
not
a
typical
example
of
the
style
with
all
the
citrus
hops
dancing
about
grade
a
dank
saison
o
until
now
my
favorite
saison
was
hennepin
but
it
has
just
been
dethroned
22oz
bomber
of
world
class
saison
7
5
abv
for
31
unheard
of
o
i
think
ive
found
a
new
pal
in
the
form
of
a
3
bomber
go
victory
not
the
best
saison
ever
but
for
the
price
and
brown
bottle
this
kicks
ass
overall
impression
a
solid
beer
that
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
is
but
nothing
terribly
novel
or
impressive
what
a
beautiful
beer
pours
a
3
head
tinged
canary
yellow
clear
sunny
yellow
body
smells
mildly
of
citrus
zest
although
as
the
label
tells
it
doesnt
contain
any
citrus
or
spices
its
all
from
the
malt
hops
and
yeast
taste
has
the
citrus
zest
too
in
a
fairly
rich
body
and
a
substantially
lasting
finish
this
beer
is
classy
would
have
appeal
to
both
bmc
and
craft
beer
drinkers
and
is
really
a
good
value
at
the
3
70
per
1
pint
6
oz
size
i
paid
for
it
helios
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
large
white
lasting
head
there
is
a
strong
lemon
smell
alot
of
floral
smells
as
well
the
taste
is
strong
sharp
and
alot
of
floral
notes
the
taste
while
is
full
can
be
too
sharp
and
can
be
a
bit
offensive
and
can
use
some
more
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
sasion
there
are
better
and
certinalty
worse
a
good
thrist
quenching
beer
thats
very
approachable
excellent
saison
regardless
of
the
price
when
you
take
the
price
into
consideration
this
is
a
cant
beat
this
is
best
saison
dollar
for
dollar
will
i
still
drink
my
old
favorites
hennepin
jack
dor
sure
but
i
definitely
will
revisit
this
again
and
again
recommended
golden
color
with
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
tons
of
bubbles
sticking
to
sides
and
a
non
stop
flow
up
the
middle
of
the
beer
minimal
head
but
what
is
there
is
bubbly
and
hanging
out
aroma
is
fruity
ripeness
yeast
is
present
but
not
overpowering
it
blends
well
with
the
grapefruit
lemon
peel
and
orange
notes
flavor
has
a
carbonation
tingle
right
upfront
but
transitions
to
yeasty
bubblegum
some
of
the
lemon
curls
up
for
the
finish
but
i
am
predominantly
getting
bubblegum
through
the
yeast
and
bubblegum
bounce
back
and
forth
at
one
moment
im
tasting
the
yeast
then
the
gum
the
finish
is
bold
on
earthy
dryness
but
there
is
that
typical
saison
yeast
finish
that
can
not
be
escaped
overall
great
beer
for
hot
weather
perfect
beer
to
drink
from
a
tulip
or
wine
glass
as
a
reward
for
a
hard
days
work
out
in
the
heat
very
refreshing
goes
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
grilled
foods
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
it
seemed
a
little
off
the
style
but
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
now
to
my
racer
5
to
the
rescue
o
overall
helios
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
addendum
after
reading
beeradvocate
entry
for
this
beer
i
realized
it
is
7
5abv
it
is
as
refreshing
as
a
beer
that
weighs
in
at
4
5
i
e
narragansett
summer
crack
this
beer
and
thank
whatever
powers
you
trust
warning
your
partner
may
also
like
this
beer
d
nice
and
drinkable
beer
good
with
food
i
would
drink
again
d
could
drink
this
again
and
again
very
nice
offering
from
victory
that
i
will
be
keeping
my
eye
out
for
again
dang
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
its
got
a
great
combination
of
flavors
and
the
smell
is
just
outstanding
at
this
price
i
cant
think
of
a
better
value
in
any
style
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
very
lively
carbonation
in
fact
i
turned
my
back
for
a
second
just
after
i
cracked
the
bottle
and
i
had
foam
coming
up
the
bottle
and
running
down
the
sides
assertive
brett
aromas
up
front
with
a
bit
of
tart
lemon
and
a
little
spicy
note
almost
like
grains
of
paradise
i
find
the
brett
pretty
dominant
on
the
palate
on
this
one
not
bad
for
me
since
i
like
brett
but
its
a
bit
more
domineering
than
i
want
in
a
summer
saison
carbonation
is
very
high
in
fact
tied
with
the
fact
that
it
foamed
over
on
me
when
i
opened
it
leads
me
to
believe
the
brettanomyces
got
a
little
out
of
control
on
this
one
still
i
am
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
offers
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
o
after
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
i
was
quite
excited
it
was
disappointing
i
enjoy
saisons
a
lot
but
this
one
did
not
cut
it
for
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
i
havent
had
many
saisons
at
all
but
this
one
was
a
good
one
to
start
with
a
bomber
of
helios
from
the
brewers
at
victory
apparently
inspired
by
the
sun
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowishgolden
color
similar
to
the
sun
perhaps
a
big
cap
of
white
foam
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
contains
some
apple
and
yeast
with
cracker
malt
underneath
nimble
on
the
palate
the
flavor
begins
with
a
touch
of
belgian
fruitiness
but
is
taken
over
by
lemon
tinged
sourness
the
apple
the
yeast
and
the
lemon
combine
to
create
a
thirst
quenching
experience
before
the
end
drops
out
a
good
summer
ale
and
respectable
attempt
at
the
belgian
inspired
ale
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
thought
the
hops
along
with
the
yeast
spice
went
quite
nicely
a
good
offering
and
something
i
would
have
again
overall
this
is
good
for
the
style
it
helps
wash
down
spaghetti
very
well
its
well
constructed
and
very
affordable
o
definitely
a
good
summer
beer
light
on
the
tongue
yet
tasty
o
im
good
with
beers
where
the
brett
character
is
a
little
more
muted
but
theres
a
lot
of
it
in
this
one
i
guess
thats
not
bad
if
thats
what
you
like
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
this
particular
one
isnt
for
me
i
still
give
it
45
since
its
very
well
done
o
this
is
such
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
bretted
saisons
out
there
and
for
3
50bottle
one
of
the
absolute
best
craft
values
bar
none
overall
i
guess
this
one
is
ok
but
it
really
is
either
too
much
yeast
or
spice
since
its
kind
of
off
putting
popped
the
cap
on
this
one
and
went
to
rinse
out
my
glass
and
the
bottle
was
noticeably
foaming
over
when
i
went
for
the
pour
it
pours
a
very
hazy
straw
color
with
a
huge
head
that
quickly
settles
down
to
something
more
manageable
aroma
is
good
a
bit
of
ripe
fruit
funkiness
and
yeastiness
the
taste
is
very
good
as
far
as
my
tastes
on
saisons
go
the
fruitiness
funkiness
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
keep
the
yeast
in
check
its
just
a
deliicous
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
the
abv
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
saisons
are
really
hit
or
miss
with
me
but
this
ones
a
hit
for
sure
o
good
but
not
that
great
a
saison
yummy
but
not
something
i
would
trade
for
pours
golden
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
12
fills
the
glass
to
start
fades
to
a
more
reasonable
level
and
sticks
around
as
a
nice
cap
aromas
of
very
ripe
fruit
i
get
grapes
and
plums
with
a
touch
of
barnyard
floating
around
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
fruity
as
well
but
with
some
definite
funk
which
is
a
pleasant
surprise
notes
of
ripe
soft
cheese
and
a
touch
of
barnyard
complement
the
peach
and
cherry
notes
a
little
bit
tart
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
softer
side
a
bit
different
than
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
farmhouse
ale
take
on
the
style
quite
nice
i
hope
this
was
a
bad
bottle
as
it
tasted
skunked
besides
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
this
tasted
bad
bad
bad
as
in
spoiled
found
the
expiration
date
on
the
bottle
and
its
212
so
i
must
assume
that
either
i
hate
this
kind
of
ale
the
bottle
has
been
seriously
mishandled
or
this
type
of
beverage
has
been
fooling
people
for
years
and
is
another
case
of
the
emperor
not
wearing
clothes
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
scent
thats
light
along
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
damn
fine
yeast
aroma
it
has
a
nice
citrus
feel
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
funk
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
easy
drinking
a
solid
base
the
hops
provide
adequate
bitterness
and
the
yeast
rounds
out
the
palate
with
lots
of
earthy
farmhouse
funk
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
saison
its
flavorful
and
true
to
style
although
the
appearance
seems
off
it
looks
like
it
filtered
which
takes
away
from
the
authenticity
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
white
head
with
good
retention
aromas
are
bursting
with
bakery
fresh
bread
and
yeastiness
with
a
strong
savory
notes
flavors
of
sourdough
bread
with
honey
on
top
a
pleasant
sourness
lingers
long
a
layered
delicious
brew
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
avoid
the
alcohol
taste
love
the
style
big
fan
of
the
brewery
this
beer
was
just
not
for
me
there
are
other
siason
brews
out
there
that
are
far
better
very
tasty
and
refreshing
o
a
really
nice
saison
from
victory
this
brew
does
seem
to
harnass
the
suns
energy
into
making
it
taste
so
lively
and
citrusy
sweet
the
7
5
abv
is
noted
only
slightly
in
the
robust
belgian
flavor
profile
id
love
to
grab
a
bottle
for
my
next
chicken
piccatta
or
orangeglazed
salmon
dinner
overall
this
was
a
good
rendition
of
a
saison
type
ale
enjoyable
for
sure
on
a
90
degree
day
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
bright
yellow
color
what
is
pretty
clean
looking
the
head
is
big
and
white
it
leaves
a
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
zesty
aroma
kind
of
citrusy
and
yeasty
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
citrusy
with
some
spice
and
some
light
bread
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
brew
the
body
is
on
the
thinner
side
and
pretty
refreshing
overall
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
some
day
its
just
a
matter
of
time
and
money
before
i
can
get
some
again

a

a
little
let
down
with
the

to
match
what
i
was
getting
a
damn
fine
saison
drinkability
its
springsummer
and
that
means
its
saison
time
this
is
definitely
a
worthy
and
affordable
american
interpretation
of
the
belgian
saison
style
i
benchmark
everything
against
the
best
saison
in
the
world
saison
dupont
and
this
one
comes
very
close
for
an
american
beer
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this

up

ooverall
a
solid
brew
not
overly
drinkable
definitely
need
to
take
your
time
with
this
one
nice
stuff
from
victory
as
usual
the
alcohol
really
kills
this
one
were
the
abv
2
lower
it
might
be
a
winner
as
is
its
drinkable
but
im
not
even
slightly
interested
in
finishing
more
than
half
the
bottle
should
have
waited
to
split
it
with
someone
hmm
poured
from
the
22oz
bottle
into
my
fluted
pilsner
glass
cloudy
bright
color
quite
nice
smell
and
taste
were
more
flowery
than
funky
for
me
i
like
the
saison
style
but
for
this
one
couldnt
get
past
the
flower
petal
taste
mouthfeel
was
mediumlight
and
easy
to
drink
overall
not

bad
but
i
like
hennepin
better
its

great
personally
i
enjoypreferseekout
the
often
wild
variations

there
is

a

that
is
a
minor
criticism
notes
overall
a
nice
beer
with
some
decent
layers
of
flavor
within
a
nice
drinkable
package
poured
a
nice
golden
color
witha
hugh
fluffy
white
head
great
funky
aromas
brett
barnyard
rose
petal
and
hibiscus
light
to
medium
bodied
dangerously
drinkable
tart
and
funky
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
grows
on
you
with
more
sipping
i
let
it
out
of
the
fridge
for
an
hour
so
but
a
little
more
warming
didnt
hurt
id
like
to
try
this
again
from
another
batch
pours
pale
hazy
yellow
with
active
foamy
head
and
some
sediment
virtually
no
lacing
the
appearance
reminds
me
a
wheat
beer
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
has
that
bottle
aged
belgium
smell
that
stings
your
nose
the
flavor
is
similar
to
wheat
beer
but
this
is
super
crisp
and
fruity
the
down
side
is
that
it
has
the
mucky
aftertaste
that
i
dont
love
about
wheat
beer
previously
i
havent
noticed
beer
tasting
like
lemongrass
but
this
beer
really
does
have
that
lemonherbal
grassiness
the
body
is
really
light
even
at
a
7
5
abv
this
is
something
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
easily
when
super
cold
this
is
refreshing
goodness
for
being
pretty
similar
in
style
vaguely
i
prefer
oberon
from
bells
brewery
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
appearance
is
cloudy
and
strawlike
the
smell
is
not
overwhelmingsome
spices
but
nothing
overwhelming
to
the
nose
now
the
mouth
feel
is
fantasticswished
it
around
and
it
was
almost
as
if
i
was
chewing
on
a
piece
of
bubble
gum
taste
wise
it
was
good
pretty
sweet
with
a
little
bitter
finish
and
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
warm
afternoon
but
also
an
easy
beer
to
sneak
up
on
you
with
a
pretty
decent
abv
pours
a
lovely
golden
amber
with
an
off
white
head
smells
strongly
of
belgian
yeast
white
grape
and
caramel
the
taste
is
so
complex
up
front
is
the
yeast
with
a
sour
attack
then
it
gives
way
to
celery
coffee
and
finishes
with
juicy
indoor
fruit
namely
apples
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
the
beer
that
helped
introduce
me
to
the
wonderful
complexity
belgian
yeast
contributes
to
flavor
profiles
o
i
quite
liked
this
beer
a
very
nice
nose
and
a
pleasant
flavor
made
for
a
good
experience
fruitier
sweeter
and
misplaced
spicyplastic
taste
are
the
main
reasons
why
this
beer
doesnt
compete
with
classic
belgian
versions
but
is
certainly
on
par
with
others
make
in
america
the
taste
is
very
good
with
some
yeast
fruitiness
which
leans
toward
white
grape
and
the
hop
flavor
is
herbalspicy
some
of
the
spice
seems
to
be
amplified
by
the
yeast
and
alcohol
is
adding
to
the
dry
quality
of
malt
and
yeast
in
the
brew
i
like
how
it
is
refreshing
with
good
flavor
from
the
yeast
and
has
some
hop
bitterness
the
saison
is
very
traditional
in
taste
true
to
the
standard
dupont
which
is
good
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
prefer
a
little
more
malt
this
is
a
super
dry
and
a
little
on
the
alcoholic
side
for
my
taste
very
nice
not
one
of
the
masterpieces
but
certainly
one
of
the
better
saisons
available
and
for
less
than
4
a
bomber
why
not
d
i
could
easily
drink
2
bombers
of
this
in
a
night
without
a
problem
especially
at
such
a
great
price
tastespicy
dusty
yeast
nice
hop
bite
fruity
with
a
dry
peppery
finish
a
bit
of
underlying
sourtartness
while
not
unpleasant
doesnt
quite
harmonize
with
the
other
flavors
and
keeps
me
from
giving
this
beer
a
higher
score
that
being
said
this
is
a
fine
refreshing
saison
that
would
be
welcome
on
a
warm
sping
or
summer
day
22

an
inch

went

quickly
pretty
much
no

i
can

and
some
pale

also
theres
a
bittersour

that
kinda
reminds
me
of
sourdough
bread
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
crisp
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
enough
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
its
certainly
not
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
however
for
3
99
a
bottle
its
worth
a
try
2007
bottle
somewhat
clear
golden
fluid
with
a
white
head
of
decent
makeup
size
and
retention
what
does
cloud
the
glass
is
chunky
and
suspended
well
smell
is
malty
with
apples
and
pears
some
alcohol
funk
and
faint
banana
some
floral
hops
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
big
malt
core
and
bready
dinner
rolls
some
alcohol
flows
in
and
while
evident
is
quite
well
integrated
nice
hop
blend
adds
the
requisite
balance
without
taking
away
the
spotlight
on
the
malt
feel
is
kinda
full
and
creamy
with
an
excellent
carbonation
drinkability
just
makes
the
4
as
i
usually
find
saisons
to
be
a
bit
more
quenching
and
lighter
still
a
satisfying
brew
and
on
i
will
revisit
fresh
from
random
notes
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
malty
nose
with
notes
of
coriander
leather
pear
hay
and
floral
hops
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
flavor
is
very
earthy
spicy
and
floral
notes
of
coriander
yeast
hay
alcohol
grass
ripe
peach
and
lemon
zest
finishes
with
more
earthen
spicieness
nice
but
average
beer
however
d
absolutely
fantastical
fabulous
beer
i
am
so
glad
i
happened
upon
it
i
am
definitely
going
to
beat
the
southern
ca
heat
with
this
beer
this
summer
i
love
this
beer
i
love
a
good
saison
this
one
is
a
golden
colored
liquid
with
a
lot
of
solids
floating
throughout
but
other
than
that
good
clarity
very
little
head
however
the
smell
is
great
lemon
rind
clove
pale
malt
spice
pepper
and
orange
blossoms
the
taste
is
semidry
with
a
notable
malt
flavor
the
clove
and
citrus
qualities
come
out
as
well
along
with
a
cheesy
aged
hop
taste
i
wish
that
the
beer
were
more
spritzy
though
although
carbonated
its
a
bit
too
still
great
flavor
and
spell
but
it
could
be
a
little
better
d
certainly
to
the
american
side
of
things
identifiable
as
a
saison
though
if
it
were
called
a
hoppy
belgian
pale
or
bipa
id
believe
it
good
flavours
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
compared
to
the
better
versions
of
this
style
but
for
less
than
6
a
bomber
its
pretty
inexpensive
for
saison
d
its
strange
but
i
would
totally
have
another
makes
me
want
to
grab
my
hoe
and
start
working
the
soil
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
but
enjoyable
overall
helios
is
a
solid
saison
with
a
very
attractive
price
point
at
3
99
for
a
bomber
at
that
price
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
all
in
all
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
anyone
whos
never
had
a
belgian
style
ale
especially
a
farmhouse
ale
d
i
will
not
have
another
this
beer
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
d
an
excellent
saison
probably
not
at
the
top
of
the
list
but
provides
lots
of
flavor
and
depth
for
a
very
reasonable
price
ill
come
back
to
this
one
again
d
at
7
5
its
a
bit
heavy
but
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
long
sorry
i
didnt
find
it
until
the
end
of
the
season
d
very
nice
refreshing
dry
medium
bodied
spicey
with
light
fruit
notes
works
really
well
very
nice
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
this
kind
of
flavor
out
of
a
siason
but
it
worked
pretty
well
drinkability
is
high
flavorful
enough
to
remain
interesting
but
not
something
that
whips
your
taste
buds
either
this
compares
favorably
with
hennepin
with
a
little
higher
amount
of
hops
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
us
made
saisons
ive
come
across
avoiding
the
common
underattenuation
pitfall
the
brett
is
a
great
touch
and
really
transforms
this
from
a
decent
saison
to
one
that
is
exceptional
d
this
is
not
like
any
other
saison
i
have
had
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
this
beer
is
sour
and
refreshing
i
like
it
very
drinkable
and
nice
d
very
very
drinkable
though
i
wish
it
had
been
warmer
day
notes
a
great
saison
i
hope
the
helios
is
just
as
tasty
d
a
very
enjoyable
saison
from
victory
thankfully
not
an
overhopped
version
of
the
style
which
i
was
a
little
concerned
about
this
primarily
lets
a
bold
yeastiness
play
definitely
not
a
bad
thing
when
this
is
the
result
i
thought
it
could
have
been
slightly
sweeter
even
for
a
dry
style
this
one
seems
slightly
overfocused
on
yeasty
fermentation
byproducts
d
pretty
quaffable
stuff
wish
i
could
have
found
this
around
here
over
the
summer
pours
light
with
a
whit
head
straw
coloring
nose
is
citrus
pepper
spice
and
some
earth
the
taste
is
light
and
grassy
with
a
bit
of
flowers
a
bit
of
lemon
and
pepper
as
well
feel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
a
decent
attempt
but
nothig
truly
special
the
beer
has
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
thinner
body
crisp
minimal
aftertaste
its
easy
to
drink
fairly
refreshing
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
it
appears
my
bottle
was
unaffected
by
the
extreme
overcarbonation
safety
issue
drinkability
i
took
down
two
bombers
no
problem
it
hides
its
alcohol
with
the
best
it
saddens
me
this
is
a
summer
beer
because
i
could
drink
it
all
year
long
overall
i
would
try
it
again
especially
for
the
more
than
reasonable
price
tag
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
the
saison
to
try
or
a
great
representation
of
the
style
very
drinkable
i
finished
the
bottle
myself
with
my
meal
i
would
gladly
grab
this
one
again
for
my
next
bbq
3
99
a
bomber
ill
drink
more
nothing
special
though
overall
impressions
nice
beer
for
a
saturday
night
not
too
much
of
an
alcohol
burn
for
something
this
strong
probably
my
second
favorite
saison
the
mouthfeel
was
excellent
rendering
this
brew
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
another
to
savor
a
fantastic
summer
brew
but
welcome
anytime
im
sure
helios
is
the
type
of
beer
a
nonbeer
drinker
might
enjoy
its
very
pleasant
and
very
bright
in
appearance
flavor
and
look
d
yummy
beer
this
was
one
of
the
two
recalled
batches
and
i
didnt
have
a
problem
no
gusher
or
anything
mine
was
pushed
all
the
way
to
the
back
of
the
fridge
for
a
while
right
next
to
the
cooling
unit
though
wonderful
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
buying
again
way
better
than
the
bottled
version
this
is
much
less
sour
and
much
more
tasty
to
the
style
very
good
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
a
saison
i
am
really
digging
it
right
now
it
is
perhaps
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
prefer
but
the
initial
carbonation
really
helps
to
offset
this
in
the
beginning
as
time
wears
on
though
it
seems
to
not
maintain
the
interest
it
loses
a
bit
of
complexity
perhaps
or
more
appropriately
i
think
it
needed
a
bit
more
fermentation
complexity
it
seems
to
need
a
bit
more
yeast
derived
spiciness
and
bite
i
think
that
the
grain
character
which
is
nice
by
the
way
becomes
a
bit
too
dominant
in
the
end
it
somehow
weakens
the
finish
of
this
beer
yeah
man
not
much
you
can
say
about
this
one
except
that
its
an
insanely
good
deal
very
good
beer
for
the
best
price
around
3
95
a
solid
saison
with
pretty
much
everything
youd
expect
from
the
style
meaning
a
light
orangy
color
nice
funky
farmhouse
nose
not
too
strong
though
and
then
a
generally
light
and
drinkable
wheatycitruslightly
sour
flavor
a
tasty
brew
for
a
phenomenal
price
will
be
getting
it
again
d
i
am
able
to
take
pretty
substantial
size
gulps
without
wincing
highly
drinkable
also
while
i
do
not
allow
price
to
impact
my
reviews
the
3
99
a
bomber
price
tag
on
this
makes
it
a
steal
ive
been
wanting
to
revisit
this
guy
but
i
kept
getting
bad
bottles
thankfully
the
ck
has
my
back
yet
again
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
suds
the
nose
comprises
mandarin
oranges
peach
grapefruit
and
a
light
kiss
of
a
caramel
the
taste
is
nearly
identical
with
some
additional
mild
floral
bitters
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
possibly
my
favorite
regularlyavailable
saison
clearly
a
delicious
brew
from
victory
which
utilizes
the
farmhouse
style
but
adds
in
their
own
splash
of
signature
style
this
was
super
fresh
out
of
the
growler
and
i
cant
wait
to
pick
up
some
more
the
body
is
a
little
heavy
for
my
liking
but
the
massive
amounts
of
carbonation
make
it
feel
lighter
and
easier
to
drink
just
a
solid
beer
that
happens
to
be
inexpensive
the
nose
was
really
scaring
me
into
thinking
this
beer
was
past
its
prime
but
the
taste
brought
in
some
really
fine
citrus
flavors
a
great
beer
from
victory
d
the
beer
is
refreshing
but
not
quite
as
some
of
the
others
in
this
style
however
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
if
i
wanted
to
have
a
saison
on
a
warm
day
in
the
spring
or
fall
d
a
decent
saison
but
not
much
funkiness
to
it
some
nice
citrus
especially
oranges
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
quite
a
wonderful
summerthemed
ale
from
victory
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
pretty
refreshing
id
have
liked
it
just
a
touch
drier
but
it
was
nice
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
lots
and
lots
of
rising
carbonation
this
translated
to
a
very
vigorous
head
of
yellowtinted
foam
that
was
a
good
three
fingers
thick
and
refused
to
yield
over
time
the
aroma
was
of
crystal
malt
pale
malt
belgian
yeast
some
mustiness
semisweet
citrus
peel
and
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
weird
a
blend
of
citrus
peel
spicy
hops
musty
malt
black
pepper
earthy
yeast
and
a
very
herbal
very
bitter
finish
all
these
strong
elements
might
have
been
desirable
if
they
complimented
one
another
but
sadly
they
seemed
to
compete
it
smelled
very
farmhouse
but
tasted
very
outhouse
ouch
the
mouthfeel
was
foamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
the
off
notes
i
detected
and
amount
of
frothy
head
i
saw
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
beer
was
mishandled
id
like
to
add
as
a
caveat
thusly
that
ones
experience
with
this
beer
might
likely
be
better
than
the
bomber
i
tried
nice
crisp
finish
a
perfect
real
beer
for
the
summer
time
notes
a
beautiful
example
of
what
a
judicious
use
of
wild
yeast
can
add
to
a
belgianstyle
beer
or
perhaps
they
just
have
an
incredible
saison
yeast
and
if
so
where
can
i
buy
it
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
is
a
very
light
clear
straw
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
copious
amounts
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
with
the
head
not
clinging
at
all
aroma
was
very
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch
of
lemon
prevalent
aroma
was
wheat
taste
was
very
earthy
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
felt
decent
in
the
mouth
perhaps
a
bit
much
on
the
carbonation
very
drinkable
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
d
i
had
been
told
by
a
fellow
ba
how
great
this
beer
was
and
finally
gave
it
a
shot
he
never
told
me
it
was
a
brett
beer
might
have
been
afraid
he
wouldnt
see
another
bottle
in
the
store
if
he
told
me
this
is
a
great
surprise
find
for
me
love
saisons
and
brett
infused
ones
especially
all
i
can
say
is
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
for
3
50bomber
if
you
like
brett
beers
give
this

a

just
not
if
you
live
in
ma
leave
these
bottles
for
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
and
this
has
a
semidry
finish
drinkability
is
excellent
this
was
a
nice
surprise
something
ive
looked
past
before
but
something
i
wont
underestimate
again
a
really
nice
summer
saison
overall
i
truly
believe
this
is
an
under
appreciated
saison
and
not
only
that
it
is
priced
to
move
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
tiny
bubbles
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
beer
a
great
summer
beer
and
fantastic
with
seafood
and
most
food
for
that
matter
d
a
good
drinker
another
wellcrafted
saison
that
sits
well
in
the
middle
tier
and
would
be
worthy
of
another
purchase
helios
is
a
strange
beast
it
smells
very
good
especially
for
an
american
saison
and
avoids
being
too
maltforward
and
sweet
by
simply
going
180
degrees
in
the
opposite
direction
the
high
for
the
style
levels
of
grapefruit
bitterness
and
what
i
suspect
is
bottle
conditioning
gone
weird
are
the
only
things
holding
this
back
from
being
a
superior
american
saison
recommended
especially
if
you
can
get
a
new
batch
and
drink
them
a
few
months
apart
ill
surely
try
it
again

d
good
saison
not
overly
fruity
like
some
and
a
good
complexity
with
complementary
flavors
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
nice
take
on
the
style
something
different
nice
to
have
the
funk
as
well
as
a
defined
hop
character
definatly
worth
a
shot
ill
be
revisiting
it
soon
ranks
as
an
a
but
i
think
it
is
more
of
a
b
pours
a
clear
golden
with
some
suspended
material
and
a
big
white
fluffy
head
and
great
streamers
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
light
and
spritzy
with
a
sharp
phenolic
edge
lots
of
fruit
apricot
and
pear
and
apple
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
typically
victory
malty
and
firm
and
yet
subtle
and
clean
there
is
pear
and
apricot
with
clove
and
allspice
and
rosemary
herby
hops
coat
the
tongue
and
give
it
a
powerful
but
not
overwhelming
bitterness
on

finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
clingy
d
overall
a
pretty
good
drinker
for
7
5
abv
not
to
mention
the
3
49
price
tag
but
just
not
impressive
for
a
saison
the
bitterness
is
a
little
out
of
character
perhaps
overall
this
is
definitely
a
great
value
beer
and
delicious
to
boot
just
drank
it
with
the
worlds
greatest
sandwich
thanks
to
the
movie
spanglish
and
it
was
a
match
made
in
heaven
definitely
something
id
look
for
again
on
a
hot
summer
night
over
all
i
enjoyed
the
beer
relatively
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
just
a
little
more
of
the
funky
character
and
a
little
less
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
what
i
expected
seems
to
taste
like
it
is
between
a
saison
and
victorys
tripel
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
but
ultimately
not
very
special
or
memorable
this
saison
from
victory
visually
fits
the
style
with
a
large
rocky
head
and
dark
golden
body
hazy
from
the
yeast
sediment
as
the
head
dissipates
it
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
sweet
malt
and
light
fruity
aromas
dominate
the
nose
a
biscuity
yeast
scent
lingers
with
notes
of
cherry
and
lemon
helios
is
again
hits
the
mark
in
the
farmhouse
style
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
the
taste
is
maltforward
with
a
great
ginger
character
and
a
rush
of
spice
in
the
finish
mild
hop
bitterness
the
7
5
abv
is
hidden
well
which
aids
in
superb
drinkability
the
label
states
that
victory
was
going
for
a
specifically
belgian
style
but
it
could
use
some
improvement
in
the
hop
profile
and
choice
of
yeast
before
its
close
to
its
belgian
forefathers
overall
a
great
summer
beer
that
ill
come
back
to
cheers
drinkablity
i
cracked
a
22oz
and
could
have
another
great
for
a
saison
i
think
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
have
is
a
little
less
alcohol
so
i
could
drink
more
of
it
very
good
beer
i
had
this
by
growler
recently
and
the
brett
was
significant
yet
well
integrated
funkiness
was
nice
d
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
nothing
over
the
top
flavor
wise
but
still
bursting
with
flavor
easy
to
finish
a
bomber
and
could
crack
open
another
one
i
think
the
lower
price
i
paid
for
this
3
39
has
something
to
do
with
a
good
drinkability
score
victory
puts
out
good
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
head
and
visible
carbonation
and
particles
the
head
gives
way
to
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
with
hints
of
clove
and
a
little
pepper
there
is
also
a
smell
of
banana
present
the
taste
has
a
wheat
backbone
with
a
nice
banana
taste
over
the
top
rounded
out
with
a
hint
of
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
it
has
a
nice
variety
of
flavors
to
keep
you
interested
bought
a
couple
of
capped
22s
at
the
brewpub
retail
store
for
like
6
a
piece
i
think
awesome
deal
for
a
great
beer
pours
clear
gold
with
nice
steady
carbonation
and
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
tulip
glass
sides
smells
peppery
with
lemon
and
a
noticeable
brett
character
brett
is
a
little
musty
but
mostly
barnyard
taste
is
similar
as
the
nose
with
a
noticeable
funk
feels
light
and
refreshing
with
some
alcohol
warmth
overall
a
very
well
executed
beer
that
ive
increased
my
appreciation
for
the
more
that
ive
grown
a
taste
for
brett
and
funky
beers
victory
helios
is
a
very
sparkling
pretty
clear
pale
golden
ale
with
lots
of
particles
it
has
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
there
are
lots
of
bananas
in
the
aroma
with
notes
of
lemon
and
phenol
it
smells
fruity
and
funky
it
has
a
lively
medium
body
that
starts
a
little
heavy
on
the
tongue
and
becomes
very
light
at
the
squeaky
dry
finish
it
has
a
very
phenolic
flavor
overall
there
is
a
little
herbal
bitterness
and
something
earthy
in
there
but
its
hard
to
notice
everything
is
overpowered
by
the
taste
of
bandaids
a
long
bandaid
finish
lingers
yech
bandaid
juice
overall
timing
is
everything
i
was
looking
for
something
that
was
going
to
refresh
me
in
todays
heat
and
helios
did
but
if
i
would
have
been
looking
for
an
over
the
top
saison
i
wouldnt
have
found
it
a
sharp
wheaty
spicy
flavor
do
i
detect
some
alcohol
burn
its
a
bigger
beer
so
i
guess
that
could
be
possible
ultimately
this
brew
won
me
over
im
going
to
continue
to
investigate
this
style
and
may
rereview
this
one
down
the
road
if
i
was
at
the
brewery
i
might
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
somehow
it
was
mishandled
between
philly
and
myrtle
beach
to
cause
the
experience
i
had
but
i
probably
wont
try
it
in
a
bottle
again
d
easy
going
nice
and
refreshing
would
like
it
too
be
a
little
more
complex
for
the
abv
tax
though
drinkability
not
a
awesome
saison
not
sour
like
preferred
but
a
decent
beer
and
a
good
beer
for
people
learning
taste
is
funky
its
sweet
and
tart
hard
to
explain
its
right
on
for
a
saison
but
there
a
bit
of
that
hop
bitterness
as
well
as
wet
horse
blanket
id
say
skip
this
beer
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
pleasing
but
not
exciting
yummy
zestysour
saison
not
too
complex
but
good
with
foodand
great
drinking
on
a
springsummer
day
d
just
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
needs
to
to
be
drinkable
the
taste
is
ok
a
little
grassy
flavor
and
more
skunk
however
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
that
you
would
drink
a
lot
of
it
d
i
had
this
with
a
spicy
chinesekorean
dish
and
the
pairing
was
awesome
alone
this
is
a
beer
to
be
savored
glad
it
was
only
3
99
a
bomber
to
try
it
never
again
the
nose
is
just
fantastic
a
beautiful
saison
nose
theres
a
blend
of
light
lemon
and
grassy
hop
character
a
touch
of
brettbased
grassy
funk
a
moderate

character
with
a
little
coriander
and
white
pepper
some
honey
and
a
light
bread
note
light
floral
character
as
well
just
fantastic
the
palate
is
just
as
excellent
opening
with
a
big
brett
character
just
a
fantastic
grass
notes
blended
very
well
with
a
light
hop
character
mildly
german
in
nature
particularly
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
honey
and
spices
this
is
the
epitome
of
what
a
saison
should
be
light
and
crisp
on
the
palate
this
finishes
with
a
great
drying
grassy
light
hop
character
fantastic
stuff
this
is
something
im
going
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
summer
and
after
d
one
of
the
lighter
saisons
in
terms
of
flavor
i
steamed
some
mussels
in
this
and
had
a
glass
to
go
with
them
and
it
was
awesome
but
id
easily
drink
this
on
its
own
as
well
gotta
let
the
giant
white
fluffy
head
settle
down
a
bit
maybe
a
bit
too
aggressive

the

a
good

to

alone
ive
only
had
a
few
saisons
but
nothing
to
disticnt
as
far
as
the
flavor
is
concerned
very
thick

covers
the

overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
drinkability
isnt
all
that
high
i
was
quite
taken
aback
by
the
less
desirable
qualities
of
this
beer
but
delighted
by
its
good
qualities
not
for
everyone
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
ale
a
good
session
beer
from
victory
though
it
is
a
little
strong
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
the
price
point
cant
be
matched
however
d
nice
and
refreshing
a
simple
but
enjoyable
saison
and
at
2

for
a
bomber
a
steal
of
a
deal
3
99
for
a
22
oz
bottle
is
a
steal
with
just
a
scant
few
tweaks
here
and
there
soon
there
will
be
no
beer
in
belgium
that
we
cant
make
here
just
as
well
i
like
that
idea

no

note
very

other
brews
do

this
is
a
superb
selection
for
anytime

to
throw

the

reminds
you
what
time
it
is
this
3
bomber
is
a
dream
come
true
victory
by
a
landslide
with
this
one
d
wasnt
as
easy
to
drink
as
i
would
have
expected
at
first
but
still
enjoyable
d
extremely
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
and
its
both
pretty
much
the
same
id
quaff
this
all
day
in
the
summer
4

md
nicely
carbonated
and
lightly
bodied
this
displays
that
classic
saison
property
of
being
overly
drinkable
in
a
highalcohol
format
proceed
with
caution
and
enjoy
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
has
all
of
the
wild
appeal
that
i
like
in
these
type
of
beers
with
one
difference
the
lemon
peelcitrus
notes
add
to
this
beer
but
still
leave
a
bit
of
funkiness
to
it
helios
is
really
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
for
this
style
it
seems
to
work
really
well
my
overall
impression
is
pretty
good
for
this
beer
and
will
get
a
good
score
from
me
id
get
this
again
and
again
and
again
especially
if
it
hovers
around
4
its
probably
very
mooddependent
for
me
but
its
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
id
be
happy
to
have
this
again
i
wouldnt
exactly
want
cases
and
cases
of
the
stuff
but
id
be
happy
if
i
saw
this
on
a
tap
menu
in
a
bar
drinkability
an
above
average
saison
that
has
a
nice
combo
of
bitterness
and
fruit
far
from
my
favorite
one
bottle
is
most
i
could
have
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
an
excellent
value
for
what
you
get
d
very
drinkable
for
a
saison
not
as
spicy
as
most
ive
tried
and
sort
of
tastes
like
a
clash
between
a
saison
and
a
pilsner
has
that
champagne
quality
about
it
overall
a
decent
pour
and
for
the
price
i
would
get
it
again
d
very
nice
saison
a
real
bargain
too
35
a
case
the
funk
and
spice
are
a
little
to
heavy
for
me
to
enjoy
the
whole
22
again
as
it
warms
it
is
starting
to
show
more
of
its
flaws
not
my
favorite
saison
may
like
this
more
if
it
was
with
a
meal
im
seeing
this
paired
with
the
local
brewpubs
blackened
salmon
chowder
d
this
is
this
beers
downfall
to
me
too
rich
its
flavor
is
a
killer
on
the
tastebuds
on
my
first
sip
i
thought
this
beer
was
an
a
but
im
nearing
my
last
now
and
its
going
considerably
downhill
more
suited
to
12
oz
bottles
but
then
again
who
could
drink
a
6
of
this
but
overall
a
decent
brew
picked
this
one
up
never
had
the
vsaison
when
was
out
but
the
art
on
this
bottle
and
price
caught
my
eye
brew
poured
into
a
chalice
cup
to
a
nice
golden
color
crystal
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
on
it
the
head
retention
was
very
good
and
left
great
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
nice
mix
of
grass
lemon
and
pepper
also
maybe
some
green
fruit
somewhat
sweet
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
nice
the
grassy
flavor
comes
to
mind
at
first
but
then
seems
to
break
away
to
a
slightly
sweet
lemon
citrus
flavor
pepper
flavor
is
there
and
adds
a
nice
little
prickle
with
the
hop
presence
drinks
quite
easily
and
is
a
surprise
that
this
one
weighs
in
at
7
5
overall
i
would
say
that
this
brew
is
very
good
based
on
the
flavor
coupled
with
the
price
of
this
bomber
3
99
will
look
for
this
one
again
think
it
could
be
a
nice
summer
brew
when
looking
for
something
a
little
bigger
drinkability
is
not
so
great
sock
bad
still
manageable
d
would
def
drink
again
thinking
of
another
bottle
for
summer
after
grass
cuttingmmm
pours
a
a
golden
honey
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
settles
into
a
ring
the
aroma
has
some
horse
blanket
aromas
as
found
in
most
saisons
followed
by
white
wine
lemon
and
green
apple
some
hay
aromas
as
well
good
rustic
aroma
the
saison
has
an
aggressive
hop
flavor
which
seems
out
of
place
for
a
saison
it
kinds
of
gives
the
taste
an
asprin
like
characteristic
the
rest
of
the
flavors
are
spot
on
to
the
style
nice
horse
blanket
hay
pepper
tart
lemon
and
green
apple
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
fizzy
carbonation
perhaps
a
touch
overcarbonated
the
finish
isnt
all
that
great
with
the
asprin
like
bitterness
overall
a
decent
saison
it
has
some
nice
flavors
but
the
bitter
asprin
like
characteristics
kills
this
brew
for
me
still
good
though
just
not
great

some

comes

maybe
lemon

and
lingers
between

belgian

evident
in
the

pretty
much

mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
some
astringency
coming
out
towards
the

fairly
decent
farmhouse
however
lots
of
acidity
and
tartness
closer
to
a
belgian
strong
palefarmhouse
hybrid
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
if
you
like
cleaner
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
is
quite
good
there
is
a
lot
to
recommend
fruitiness
dryness
yeasty
funk
and
only
a
few
distractions
too
spicy
too
much
carbonation
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
try
this
on
tap
next
time
given
the
opportunity
above
average
but
not
quite
exceptional
something
just
not
quite
coherent
in
the
flavor
profile
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
other
than
to
say
it
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
thats
only
just
off
putting
enough
d
this
is
a
solid
brew
under
8
abv
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
drinkability
overall
its
a
great
session
beer
the
high
abv
limits
it
a
bit
but
is
a
great
substitution
for
white
wine
and
would
go
great
with
salads
and
fish
hennipen
is
a
bit
better
imo
but
for
the
price

you
cant
really
beat

medium

drinkable
not
really
liking
this
one
too
hot
peppery

d
drinkability
was
good
especially
for
style
like
mentioned
earlier
the
funk
balance
was
just
right
adding
for
optimal
drinking
experience
per
style
you
will
no
doubt
have
to
be
a
fan
or
respective
of
the
style
which
i
certainly
am
this
will
no
doubt
deliver
an
adventuress
journey
into
the
world
of
belgian
funk
which
was
fairly
well
captured
here
by
an
american
brewer
novices
may
want
to
split
a
bottle
at
first
until
you
gain
a
appreciation
per
style
but
overall
for
the
fan
this
beer
overall
was
a
good
experience
coupled
with
a
fairly
good
drinkability
and
enjoyability
factor
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
cap
the
bubbles
were
a
bit
fizzy
decent
head
retention
a
little
sticky
lemony
and
floral
aroma
a
bit
grassy
and
spicy
pear
and
grain
nice
flavour
fruity
lemon
and
grass
light
grain
sweetness
light
spice
it
finished
with
lingering
lemon
and
spice
plus
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
medium
to
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
pretty
tasty
overall
i
am
loving
the
mouthfeel
on
the
first
sip
fluffy
and
soft
full
and
light
all
at
the
same
time
if
that
makes
sense
it
start
out
full
but
doesnt
leave
a
bunch
of
sticky
malt
on
the
tongue
ample
carbonation
cleanses
allowing
for
a
wonderful
finish
that
asks
for
another
sip
i
can
only
hope
i
got
a
skunked
bottle
this
was
not
impressive
at
best
pours
a
nice
light
golden
color
and
has
a
vaguely
plasticy
smell
taste
is
vaugley
matly
but
rather
astringent
not
hops
no
farmhouse
quality
i
had
high
hope
but
this
is
poor
at
best
d
would
buy
if
i
was
on
the
cheap
it
is
good
but
dupont
stills
rules
the
style
but
is
a
good
offering
and
would
drink
again
pretty
versatile
semidry
saison
but
that
back
end
might
be
an
acquired
taste
a
little
like
ralphie
in
christmas
story
after
he
says
what
the
fudge
d
while
this
beer
is
more
suited
for
summer
drinking
its
still
very
drinkable
overall
quite
drinkable
but
after
one
glass
the
flavors
begin
to
wreak
havoc
on
the
tastebuds
on
my
first
sampling
of
this
beer
my
fiancee
and
i
split
the
bomber
this
time
drinking
the
entire
bottle
alone
it
becomes
a
bit
of
a
chore
still
though
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
the
clerk
that
sold
me
the
bottle
said
that
he
much
preferred
the
original
v
saison
i
may
have
to
try
that
one
myself
if
i
can
snag
a
bottle
certainly
nice
and
drinkable
not
many
domestic
versions
of
the
style
can
captivate
but
this
holds
up
well
worth
a
try
not
even
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
time
i
bought
it
to
the
time
i
poured
it
but
a
damn
fine
beer
being
that
its
the
middle
of
the
winter
and
saisons
are
beers
i
prefer
to
drink
in
the
summer
this
might
be
one
i
have
to
seek
out
in
a
few
months
to
balance
out
the
kolsch
pils
etc
d
it
is
cheap
and
delicious

saison
here
its
a
freezing
night
in
january
and
ive
been
transported
back
to
a
hot
day
on
the
back
porch
in
july
bring
on
the
salads
and
cheesecrusty
bread
lunches
nice
saison
for
a
nice
price
always
a
plus
i
could
go
on
and
on
but
i
think
ive
pretty
much
summed
it
up
some
of
these
victory
experiments
are
serious
misses
in
my
book
one
of
the
few
breweries
where
the
regular
lineup
is
better
than
the
special
stuff
overall
a
bit
maltheavy
and
lagerlike
the
tweaks
to
the
style
are
not
for
the
better
but
still
not
bad
and
quite
refreshing
if
youre
not
into
super
strong
saison
flavor
but
still
like
a
little
funk
heres
your
beer
great
bang
for
the
buck
now
im
a
huge
novice
so
maybe
my
palate
is
just
feeble
and
untrained
but
i
actually
had
this
pegged
as
a
pilsener
i
was
surprised
to
come
here
and
see
it
was
a
saison
if
you
like
pils
i
think
youd
enjoy
this
as
well
oh
and
at
2
99
for
a
bomber
you
cant
beat
the
price
d
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
weird
one
the
wild
yeast
character
is
intense
with
a
huge
nose
of
musty
and
very
enjoyable
funk
the
flavor
shows
some
background
notes
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
normal
saison
but
the
funk
still
dominates
here
it
is
not
as
pleasantly
complex
as
it
is
in
the
nose
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
a
funky
cheeselike
wild
beer
it
is
pretty
drinkable
for
something
so
over
the
top
funky
very
good
example
of
the
style
bright
color
but
a
little
cloudy
very
good
carbonation
flavor
also
good
very
drinkable
and
it
doesnt
smack
you
in
the
face
with
offensive
bretthorseblanketbarnyardfeces
aromas
or
flavors
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
wine
glasses
it
pours
like
a
typical
saison
hazy
golden
and
a
big
white
head
the
smell
was
lemony
but
less
than
i
expected
it
had
all
the
flavors
i
was
looking
for
but
they
were
not
as
strong
as
expected
lemony
and
zesty
the
beer
was
easy
drinking
and
paired
well
with
my
fish
a
good
valueunder
4
but
there
are
more
flavorful
examples
of
the
style
pours
from
the
22oz
bottle
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
pillowy
head
that
settles
into
a
light
lacing
the
carbonation
is
light
but
active
the
aroma
is
of
hay
grass
lemon
1st
sip
is
crisp
dry
with
notes
of
bitter
citrus
peel
orange
lemon
that
intensify

the

mouthfeel
is

tingly
light
crisp
drinkability
is
superb
i
could
easily
down
one
after
another
on
a
july
day
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
would
go
very
well
at
a
cookout
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
quite
a
pleasant
beer
victory
does
it
again
overall
this
isnt
a
terribly
complex
saison
but
whats
done
is
done
well
well
worth
a
shot
especially
at
such
a
reasonable
price
dr
hope
so
i
bought
a
case
of
bombers
today
need
to
work
on
temp
that
beer
is
served
at
and
what
flavors
are
really
coming
through
d
goes
down
nicely
i
prefer
more
traditional
saisons
to
this
one
but
it
is
still
pretty
good
light
golden
color
with
huge
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
smell
is
of
apples
brett
and
some
tart
lemon
taste
follows
suit
bringing
in
some
pale
malt
and
leafy
hops
to
the
mix
as
well
mf
is
thin
a
bit
astringent
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
although
not
bad
especially
for
the
style
drinkable
and
refreshing
nice
beer
especially
at

the
water
out

almost
giving
it
a
dry
singe
burn
an
almost
minty
like
flavor
hides
in
the
background
with
the
fresh
dry
taste
the
sourness
doesnt
stay
too
long
but
the
funky
yeasty
flavor
does
almost
a
lemon
bread
like
taste
sticking
around
too
a
pretty
nice
funky
farmhouse
saison
that
gives
wild
yeast
and
brett
like
qualities
but
a
little
tamer
still
pretty
funky
though
and
great
for
the
price
i
dont
think
i
have
had
a
victory
beer
i
didnt
like

at

d
very

definitely

this

again
d
i
love
this

and
can
enjoy
it
all
day
nice
with
a
schnitzel
a
good
and
drinkable
ale
as
a
saison
should
be
however
there
just
wasnt
enough
there
in
the
flavor
for
me
the
finish
was
a
bit
watery
but
there
were
hints
of
grassy
farm
and
soapy
citrus
the
nose
suggested
a
bit
more
than
what
was
there
also
it
gave
me
a
slight
headache
not
sure
why
straw
color
and
really
clear
fruity
but
dry
bitter
slightly
sour
the
funk
taste
is
not
overpowering
the
nose
is
funk
alcohol
and
lemon
generally
one
saison
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
though
d
highly
drinkable
not
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
had
but
very
good
the
inexpensive
price
under
3
for
a
bomber
means
ill
be
coming
back
again
for
this
one
d
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
not
the
best
saison
i
have
had
by
any
means
but
nothing
in
it
makes
it
hard
to
drink
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
funk
the
flavors
simply
dont
mesh
that
well
and
nothing
really
sets
this
one
apart
great
value
for
your
money

is

not

prefer

i
would
recommend
this

i
had
this

the
beer
is
bright

hazy
with
an
enormous
poof
easily
4
fingers
of
foam
that
needed
time
to
dissipate
so
the
pour
could
be
completed
the
range
of
aromas
you
find
in
saisons
makes
it
difficult
to
rate
to
style
so
ill
rate
to
my
own
tastes
some
lemongrass
floral
hops
not
citrus
more
herbal
a
little
estery
fruit
in
the
background
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet

no

which
is
a
shame
a
little
peppery
aftertaste
delicious
despite
my
wishes
for
some
brett

more

at
the
style
equal
to
most
of

endeavors
d

not
great
there
is

first
sip
is
has
mellow
malt
qualities
but
toggles
to
a
carbonated
green
apple
yeasty
and
subtly
spicy
finish
i
love
saisons
and
this
stands
out
specifically
because
it
is
saison
victory
style
flavors
are
tart
and
spicy
some
citrus
black
pepper
sharp
hops
also
sour
fruits
mixed
with
a
touch
of
something
like
clove
overall
light
sourness
with
a
good
malt
presence
poured
a
hazy
goldentangerine
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
laced
fairly
well
the
smell
was
a
bouquet
of
lemon
apple
yeast
malt
grass
clove
and
other
spices
that
i
couldnt
place
the
taste
confirmed
all
of
the
above
with
the
fruits
upfront
dissolving
to
grass
and
spices
and
then
finishing
with
malt
and
spice
very
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
had
subtle
carbonation
and
a
nice
light
body
which
made
it
decently
sessionable
mouthfeel
was
prickly
carbonation
and
medium
to
light
in
body
a
very
solid
and
tasty
saison
for
fans
of
the
style
its
a
nice
solid
beer
if
you
have
always
wondered
what
a
good
farmhouse
tastes
like
give
it
a
try
and
if
you
dont
like
it
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
this
one
didnt
kill
your
wallet
drinkability
is
great
i
would
love
sip
this
all
day
i
will
definately
pick
up
a
few
of
these
if
i
see
it
out
there
thanks
to
whoever
sent
this
as
an
extra
in
whatever
trade
we
did
d
a
little
strong
on
the
farmhouse
and
less
crisp
than
most
but
still
great
d
well
given
the
price
point
this
is
a
nice
verson
of
the
style
highly
recomended
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
mostly
of
alcohol
with
some
yeast
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
not
really
a
beer
i
could
drink
to
many
of
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
brew
mediumlight
gold
with
a
mediumlarge
white
pillowy
slowlydiminishing
head
the
smell
is
wonderfully
funky
from
the
wild
belgian
yeast
its
dusty
with
sweet
malts
and
pungent
dusty
fruit
aromas
peach
and
lemon
among
others
the
taste
follows
but
with
more
of
that
barnyard
funk
that
is
an
aquired
taste
ive
acuired
it
and
think
its
wonderful
it
has
a
light
lingering
medicinal
bandaidlike
funk
mixed
with
a
touch
of
bubblegum
odd
yes
but
it
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
soft
texture
and
moderatelively
carbonation
this
was
a
great
find
and
with
its
reasonable
cost
this
is
one
i
definitely
recommend
trying
a
nice
refreshing
beer
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
gold
color
with
a
faint
haze
there
was
a
thick
white
head
it
had
a
pleasant
citrus
aroma
a
peppery
lemon
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
late
hops
crisp
thirstquenching
a
good
summer
beer
try
it
listen
for
under
4
its
good
to
have
around
good
standard
quality
nothing
really
groundbreaking
here
but
it
works
for
those
belgiophiles
on
a
budget
d
split
the
bomber
but
could
of
took
it
to
the
head
the
7
5
is
a
bit
high
for
a
saison
and
the
alcohol
shows
its
head
only
a
bit
during
the
experience
if
i
could
cook
i
would
of
made
a
dish
to
pair
this
with
as
that
would
have
made
this
even
tastier
on
its
own
helios
rocks
even
if
its
not
a
new
beer
overall
this
was
a
very
very
solid
offering
here
i
though
the
abv
was
remarkably
well
hidden
and
it
went
down
smooth
and
easy
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
having
this
one
again
any
day
drinkability
around
34
a
bottle
for
this
are
you
kidding
me
this
will
now
be
the
best
most
readily
available
most
affordable
domestic
saison
i
challenge
you
to
let
me
know
where
i
can
find
another
with
those
attributes
this
good
especially
one
that
tastes
like
an
import
bravo
victory
for
keeping
the
goodness
if
v
saison
alive
ill
be
buying
a
lot
more
of
this
bomber
from
state
line
elkton
md
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
helios
is
another
winner
from
victory
drinkability
this
beer
was
so
flavorful
on
tap
i
could
have
had
several
glasses
in
the
session
easy
to
drink
and
great
saison
imho
22
oz
bomber
purchased
from
total
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
great
pour
and
appearance
golden
and
hazy

with
a
fluffy
thick
white
head
and
visible
carbonation
raw
dusty
earthy
aroma
with
faint
hints
of
lemon
and
slight
lime
which
were
also
present
in
the
flavor
the
overall
taste
lacked
the
bite
and
spritz
of
european
saisons
but
this
was
nonetheless
a
good
american
rendition
hazy
light
goldstraw
color
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
that
supports
a
fluffy
white
head
and
splotches
of
lacing
aroma
is
very
fresh
and
mildy
funky
noble
hops
grassy
pepper
citrus
and
slight

balance

yeast
with
some
spice
pepper
and
clove
and
mild
caramel
malt
very
nice
easy
drinking
saison
at
the
price
and
availability
this
will
become
a
goto
beer
very
carbonated
up
front
with
a
creamy
medium
body
lots
of
earthy
notes
hop
bitterness
light
crisp

citrus

and
strong

astringency
slightly
dry
finish
d
a
touch
to
funky
for
me
to
have
more
than
a
half
a
22
it
has
a
huge
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
color
is
a
cloudy
golden
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
hay
and
bread
the
flavors
really
meld
and
taste
farmy
they
dont
call
this
a
farmhousestyle
belgian
for
nothing
lots
of
earthy
flavors
with
hay
grass
pine
and
autumn
spices
black
pepper
kicks
in
mid
tongue
under
it
and
through
the
finish
is
grapefruit
its
really
a
unique
combination
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
brew
that
tasted
like
this
it
could
be
off
putting
or
delicious
depending
on
your
tastes
i
like
it
but
i
would
definitely
limit
it
to
an
occasional
purchase
d
fine
version
of
a
saison
with
plenty
of
spicy
and
funky
character
i
found
this
to
be
quite
drinkable
while
still
maintaining
a
fairly
complex
flavor
overall
drinkability
is
great
a
beer
youll
have
no
problems
with
share
with
friends
dont
be
stingy
in
fact
this
style
of
beer
when
done
right
has
potential
to
convert
most
friends
especially
women
to
the
craft
beer
movement
i
was
at
victorys
last
tenth
anniversary
party
and
i
hope
im
able
to
have
a
blast
at
the
next
one
oh
yeah
victory
is
supposedly
coming
into
west
virginia
in
the
not
so
distant
future
i
notice
when
im
inspired
to
write
a
lot
its
always
a
good
beer
this
is
better
than
most
and
may
be
my
new
favorite
saison
not
digging
this
probably
because
i
was
hopeing
it
was
a
pale
ale
or
somthing
besides
a
saison
mouthfeel
is
citrusy
medium
bodied
with
a
tad
bit
of
clean
funk
poured
into
a
glass
very
pleasant
apperance
greaterbeing
golden
glowing
color
very
frothy
head
many
many
spirling
bubbles
to
the
top
i
hope
this
beer
makes
me
as
happy
as
the
sun
on
the
label
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
smell
aromas
of
hops
pine
and
alchol
the
taste
is
complex
and
exquisite
medley
of
flaovrs
grain
yeast
hops
spices
cinnamon
and
a
hoppy
piney
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
the
taste
stays
in
your
mouth
until
the
next
sip
replenishes
the
flavor
i
find
this
beer
quite
drinkable
even
with
the
high
alchol
content
good
price
too
got
a
1pint
6oz
bottle
for
4
bucks
drinkability
yes
hand
me
these
every
day
of
the
summer
and
well
be
friends
very
refreshing
very
well
balanced
well
crafted
beer
this
is
an
undeniably
thirst
quenching
beer
even
at
7
5
i
really
respect
victory
for
making
this
one
more
approachable
to
the
masses
cheers
pours
a
clear
pale
orange
with
about
two
fingers
of
rocky
white
head
aroma
has
lots
of
fruit
namely
citrus
but
a
good
dose
of
apple
and
pear
as
well
there
is
also
a
nice
yeatyness
that
lurks
in
the
background
taste
is
pretty
good
complex
the
beer
is
a
bit
sour
and
tart
at
first
this
gives
way
to
a
yeasty
and
fruity
complexity
moderate
hop
bitterness
gets
lost
with
all
of
the
more
dominant
fruity
esters
and
spicy
phenols
mouthfeel
is
good
with
mediumlight
body
and
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
isnt
exactly
like
other
saisons
that
ive
tried
but
it
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
tart
but
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
saison
great
for
the
ending
days
of
summer
recommended
drinkability
is
excellent
this
one
is
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
theres
no
way
this
is
7
5
abv
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
relative
to
saison
dupont
hennepin
etc
this
doesnt
really
compare
in
the
same
style
i
dont
think
its
a
bit
too
fruity
for
that
however
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
stashing
a
few
away
before
victory
runs
out
for
the
season
a
good
value
for
the
too
not
blown
away
by
this
take
by
victory
on
a
saison
but
its
not
bad
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
sometime
not
my
cupo
tea
it
was
overly
floral
and
perfume
like
way
to
much
in
the
way
of
herbs
and
flowers
not
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
but
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
light
body
you
get
little
bits
of
the
herbs
and
spices
so
its
not
over
seasoned
i
guess
you
can
say
lol
it
has
more
of
a
wheat
beer
finish
in
all
its
a
chill
session
saison
that
you
can
totally
eat
dinner
with
i
suggest
apricot
baked
chicken
on
a
bed
orzo
pasta
o
certainly
fits
the
billing
of
a
session
saison
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
sunny
spring
or
summer
day
i
wish
it
had
more
complexity
but
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
style
that
successfully
represents
even
with
the
low
abv

on
tap
be
aware
of
the
peppercorns
that
meet
you
at
the
door
in
tandem
wthe
lemon
this
is
a
perfect
match
for
a
few
chicken
skewers
on
a
bed
of
spinach
with
a
crumble
of
blue
cheese
if
you
dont
have
the
facilities
to
do
this
yourself
go
straight
to
your
friendly
local
demand
they
support
your
research
get
on
it
ever
had
a
lemonpepper
chicken
dish
or
used
a
lemonpepper
seasoning
in
a
salad
well
heres
your
old
friend
in
a
glass
a
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
ps
its
way
sessionable
so
grab
a
6
fire
up
the
coals
o
i
can
safely
say
this
was
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
im
not
sure
if
this
was
a
skunk
batch
or
what
but
i
could
not
believe
victory
would
release
a
beer
like
that
overall
this
is
a
tasty
saison
and
gets
a
bit
of
a
bonus
for
keeping
the
alcohol
down

snaps
to
a
close
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
fairly
complex
and
extremely
drinkable
low
abv
brew
with
just
enough
twists
to
make
it
stand
out
overall
it
is
as
advertised
but
its
also
a
little
bit
weak
and
boring
o
very
easy
to
drink
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
day
basically
a
middle
of
the
road
saison
nothing
really
outstanding
about
it
but
nothing
really
wrong
either
i
would
like
to
see
the
hops
dialed
back
a
bit
i
think
they
are
dominating
a
bit
too
much
and
overwhelming
the
other
flavors
it
does
go
down
easy
but
pretty
much
an
average
beer
for
the
style
overall
a
pretty
terrific
domestic
saison
it
hits
all
the
notes
great
aroma
nice
citrus
and
lemon
flavor
appealing
dry
pepper
finish
would
drink
again
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
low
octane
offering
from
my
neighborhood
brewery
as
compared
to
other
victory
offerings
this
beer
was
more
mellow
in
taste
without
giving
up
on
the
uniqueness
that
has
become
victory
the
copious
amounts
of
lemon
zest
contribute
well
to
this
beer
as
does
the
other
spices
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
lacing
nice
though
a
bit
more
head
would
be
better
but
it
looks
like
a
quite
nice
saison

of
sour
funk
barnyardlike
mostly
with
a
tang
of
lemon
undertones
of
pepper
spiciness
and

a

spicy

and
not
the

side

with
a
large

well
done
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
that
has
a
fantastic
aroma
a
good
though
slightly
too
hoppy
flavor
and
an
excellent
mouthfeel
good
but
not
the
best
american
saison
still
quite
nice
overall
unlike
my
first
saison
which
snuck
up
on
you
with
its
8
7
abv
this
one
is
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
sessionable
at
its
4
5
abv
with
no
surprises
big
fluffy
white
head
that
really
lasted
left
lots
of
clumpy
foam
clinging
to
the
glass
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
a
bright
yellowgold
nice
aroma
with
notes
of
grain
and
spices
slightly
sour
wheat
a
bit
grassy
with
a
hint
of
coriander
and
parsley
the
flavour
was
a
little
less
interesting
but
still
alright
with
mild
bitterness
and
spice
moderate
sweetness
and
grain
character
a
bit
of
lemon
character
lingering
spice
and
bitterness
medium
bodied
low
to
medium
carbonation
decent
texture
but
maybe
a
bit
heavier
than
expected
well
done
summer
session
beer
for
when
you
want
something
different
i
liked
it
picked
up
this
one
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
at
the
local
store
generally
like
saisons
and
have
had
pretty
good
luck
with
victory
okay
appearance
but
nailed
the
smell
gives
you
that
good
saison
vibe
taste
however
returns
to
okay
not
bad
decent
saison
but
nothing
special
probably
would
not
get
the
beer
again
but
would
certainly
not
turn
one
down
pairings
dry
enough
for
fish
white
fowl
and
mixed
nuts
bright
enough
for
salads
fruits
and
cheeses
serve
early
in
a
meal
not
sweet
but
citrusy
and
acidic
enough
for
white
wine
appropriate
foods
pepper
oranges
and
bright
lemon
on
the
palate
ginger
and
lime
in
the
finish
this
is
a
fresh
tasting
and
spiced
up
saison
nice
summer
sessioner
probably
a
real
nice
fit
with
some
tangy
cheese
raw
shell
fish
salads
you
get
the
picture
just
noticed
the
laundry
list
that
victory
now
puts
out
and
my
hopes
now
rest
on
the
victory
altbier
offering
that
i
saw
advertised
with
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
tour
12
pack
coming
july2014
o
an
enjoyable
saison
will
be
nice
this
springsummer
season
glad
i
bought
a
six
of
this
victory
does
no
wrong
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
would
have
liked
some
of
the
peppery
spice
from
the
scent
to
have
made
it
into
the
taste
nevertheless
a
nice
front
porch
sipper
for
the
first
day
that
feels
like
spring
in
ohio
o
overall
lots
of
tart
and
musky
nature
packed
in
a
4

abv
package
makes
for
a
great
session
style
saision
o
refined
quite
easy
to
drink
very
much
a
saison
in
its
flavor
characteristics
they
did
manage
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
into
this
beer
though
maybe
nothing
unique
had
some
strong
similarities
to
dupont
but
its
hard
to
knock
it
something
to
keep
in
the
cooler
at
a
bbq
o
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
wasnt
this
i
will
say
that
it
isnt
watery
at
all
which
is
usually
the
first
issue
that
session
beers
have
to
overcome
it
seems
that
tasting
too
much
like
a
standard
lager
might
be
the
issue
with
session
saisons
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
the
phenols
are
pretty
hefty
by
the
end
of
the
pint
perfect
for
one
but
i
was
ready
to
move
on
when
it
was
done
still
a
really
nice
earthy
scrappy
saison
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
certainly
drinking
again
pours
a
beautiful
hazed
lemon
yellow
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
white
foam
that
fell
quickly
nose
is
funky
with
belgian
yeast
and
has
some
bright
sweet
lemon
peel
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
on
the
nose
too
taste
is
simple
and
graceful
bright
lemon
a
bit
tart
on
a
sweet
light
dry
cracker
sparkling
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
pepper
as
it
finishes
this
beer
is
everything
a
saison
should
be
has
a
very
pleasant
hop
herbal
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
drink
as
you
drink
you
will
find
a
delightful
tartness
to
offer
just
a
slight
bit
of
pucker
has
plenty
of
juicy
lemon
on
the
palate
and
a
crisp
off
dry
finish
oda
bit
of
a
let
down
a
session
saison
sounds
awesome
eh
im
sure
someone
will
nail
it
at
some
point
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
beer
and
a
must
have
for
saison
lovers
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
best
served
with
a
pork
loin
the
amount
of
spices
in
it
would
work
well
with
the
food
other
than
that
a
nice
saison
at
4
5
this
is
definitely
a
well
made
beer
as
most
are
from
victory
but
the
concept
behind
the
spicing
baffles
me
it
tastes
way
too
savory
and
herbal
like
chicken
stuffing
it
just
left
me
with
an
odd
impression
its
a
beer
worth
trying
but
im
not
sure
how
many
people
this
will
appeal
to
o
good
beer
in
my
opinion
although
not
very
much
like
a
saison
in
my
opinion
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
o
solid
saison
beer
and
at
only
4
5
you
can
have
more
then
a
few
was
missing
some
of
the
fruit
notes
and
yeast
tartness
i
like
in
saisons
great
spring
weather
beer
o
good
try
here
by
victory
a
session
saison
is
a
rare
one
to
come
across
not
quite
as
dry
or
spicy
as
id
like
but
this
is
a
real
nice
one
o
saisons
are
not
exactly
my
go
to
style
but
this
one
in
particular
was
not
a
stunner
the
white
pepper
and
clove
really
conflict
with
the
crisp
citrus
and
belgian
yeast
im
glad
i
didnt
get
a
whole
6
pack
if
the
goal
was
to
create
a
sessionable
saison
then
i
would
say
victory
certainly
did
their
job
it
is
an
interesting
flavorful
moderately
bitter
saison
with
lots
of
citrus
making
it
suitable
for
the
spring
summer
and
lots
of
cuisine
however
my
only
complaint
with
this
beer
is
that
it
tires
the
palate
and
not
because
it
is
overly
heavy
or
too
hoppy
but
because
it
should
be
dialed
down
a
few
more
notches
i
liked
classique
a
lot
which
i
reviewed
but
a
few
days
ago
because
it
was
so
basic
and
well
executed
i
find
this
to
be
reaching
so
to
speak
nonetheless
great
well
crafted
beer
has
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
very
healthy
white
foam
smell
is
lemon
but
the
taste
is
a
little
weak
theres
a
hint
of
lemon
and
some
light
spices
in
the
finish
otherwise
the
beer
is
a
little
bland
has
a
nice
carbonated
feel
but
overall
is
just
okay

with

can
put

back

still

on
this
especially
hot
and
humid
day
very
solid
saison
from
victory
that
said
i
love
victory
hop
wallop
o
a
flavorful
saison
that
is
too
spiced
to
serve
as
a
session
beer
for
some
nice
and
reffreshig
nonetheless
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
complex
and
refreshing
however
more
balance
is
in
order
this
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
spicy
and
limits
your
desire
to
have
more
than
one
on
those
hot
days
o
good
for
what
it
is
but
the
spice
is
just
a
bit
too
much
in
my
opinion
close
to
being
great
but
still
not
bad
o
swing
and
a
miss
this
one
was
quite
disappointing
considering
victory
makes
another
saison
thats
really
damn
good
and
its
another
damning
reminder
that
they
really
need
to
put
helios
in
6packs
o
hit
the
mark
on
being
a
flavorful
low
alcohol
beer
wish
would
be
a
refreshing
choice
for
lunch
if
you
had
been
working
the
farm
under
a
hot
summer
sun
the
flavors
profile
is
a
bitter
light
but
the
flavors
see
strong
against
the
lighter
backdrop
p
s
im
just
a
bit
biased
towards
victory
products
but
only
because
they
honestly
do
rock
o
white
not
the
most
flavorful
saison
it
does
a
good
job
for
its
purpose
as
a
sessionable
beer
it
drinks
more
like
a
witbier
with
some
saison
flavors
a
good
switch
up
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
it
is
very
drinkable
o
underrated
saison
sessionable
at
4
5

and
yet
has
some
saison
body
really
good
served
from

into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
golden
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
sugar
banana
runts
wheat
and
bubblegum
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
bubblegum
fruit
spice
and
subtle
banana
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
banana
runt
aspect
on
the
aroma
really
took
this
one
to
the
next
level
as
it
was
definitely
unexpected
and
took
me
back
to
my
favorite
candy
growing
up
and
still
is
the
only
candy
that
i
eat
at
all
even
today
this
brought
a
huge
level
of
complexity
to
the
game
and
made
it
quite
easy
to
get
close
to
this
beer
over
and
over
again
i
really
went
into
this
one
not
expecting
much
at
all
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
it
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
definitely
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
suggest
that
you
do
the
same
at
least
once
yourself

o
im
not
sure
about
this
one
it
has
way
more
funk
and
black
pepper
flavor
than
i
would
have
expected
but
its
lacking
the
complexity
that
makes
the
best
saisons
stand
out
i
suppose
not
completely
unexpected
for
the
quite
modest
abv
and
the
subsequent
session
tag
this
one
falls
into
the
glad
i
tried
it
once
category
for
me
the
two
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
rose
and
fell
like
an
elevator
simile
as
i
poured
it
from
the
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
finally
it
simply
fell
like
a
souffle
when
the
oven
door
is
banged
shut
doing
that
to
a
souffle
disturbs
me
but
the
gorgeous
lacing
that
this
left
behind
did
wonders
for
my
attitude
color
was
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
and
i
must
have
disturbed
the
lees
as
it
was
initially
pouring
very
clear
i
am
glad
that
the
yeast
is
back
in
suspension
as
that
is
where
the
flavor
is
derived
and
who
ever
heard
of
filtering
a
saison
nose
on
this
was
fullon
lemon
zest
leading
me
to
wonder
what
spices
were
used
id
bet
that
coriander
was
one
of
them
mouthfeel
seemed
to
be
on
the
thin
side
tending
to
watery
is
that
a
characteistic
of
the
style
i
wonder
the
taste
was
still
very
lemony
but
now
the
black
pepper
phenols
were
really
beginning
to
assert
themselves
i
spoke
in
my
previous
review
of
ithacas
ground
break
of
pairing
a
saison
with
grilled
fish
like
bass
this
beer
would
also
work
well
but
as
a
second
choice
i
liked
it
but
not
as
much
as
the
previous
one
finish
was
dry
and
lemonpeppery
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
as
i
understand
it
worth
a
go
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
that
is
fittingly
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
for
being
a
smaller
sessionable
saison
it
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
much
spice
and
too
little
maltiness
for
my
tastes
d
overall
i
think
this
saison
relies
a
little
too
much
on
spicing
which
is
a
pet
peeve
of
mine
in
saisons
i
think
victory
could
have
made
a
more
complex
beer
by
drawing
back
on
the
spices
and
pushing
yeast
estersphenols
a
little
more
overall
this
is
pretty
awesome
for
the
hot
weather
weve
been
having
but
it
has
its
flaws
i
should
say
though
that
it
could
be
worse
it
could
be
sweet
undercarbonated
and
overly
phenolic
an
interesting
beer
with
lots
of
character
unfortunately
i
doubt
i
would
want
another
right
after
which
kind
of
kills
it
for
being
a
session
beer
otherwise
enjoyable
a
pretty
good
session
saison
and
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
definitely
plan
on
picking
another
one
up
if
i
can
find
one

by
brewing
a
light
tasted
a
lot
like
stella
artois
or
like
the
lines
needed
cleaning
dont
know
which
i
had
this
from
a
small
sample
at
a
tasting
i
thought
it
lacked
the
typical
smells
and
tastes
of
a
farmhouse
ale
well
made
just
not
a
saison
this
beer
is
easy
on
the
eyes
but
its
not
quite
as
easy
on
the
tongue
i
like
the
citrus
flavors
but
the
hint
of
spiciness
feels
just
a
touch
out
of
place
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
great
overall
great
saison
in
going
to
buy
more
of
this
excellent
session
beer
bright
and
refreshing
this
beer
should
have
a
higher
rating
here
on
ba
than
it
does
sure
its
hoppy
but
the
bitterness
contributes
to
the
style
rather
than
distracts
from
it
the
hops
focus
the
interesting
spice
its
definitely
allagashsmell
and
taste
that
fruity
allagash
yeastbut
its
also
got
clove
and
bubblegum
and
and
loads
of
prickly
pepper
and
a
bit
of
saison
funk
underneath
excellent
this
beer
is
overhopped
which
distracts
from
the
unique
taste
and
wonderfully
refreshing
finish
of
a
saison
if
you
want
to
pay
15
for
four
12
oz
bottles
of
a
good
ipa
this
beer
is
for
you
not
much
of
a
malt
flavor
yes
it
has
a
citrus
and
a
peppery
spice
taste
but
i
can
get
that
with
an
ipa
i
definitely
would
not
describe
this
beer
as
full
bodied
overall
nice
saison
definitely
a
good
option
to
keep
as
a
staple
in
the
fridge
this
is
the
most
recent
allagash
i
have
tried
and
i
was
disappointed
by
it
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
attaching
the
name
allagash
to
the
word
quality
and
there
was
certainly
a
disconnect
with
this
beer
in
a
word
it
was
blah
a
regular
beer
off
the
shelf
again
not
what
i
am
used
to
with
an
allagash
feel
a
little
thin
but
good
amount
of
carbonation
even
for
an
american
interpretation
on
the
style
i
found
the
hops
in
this
saison
to
be
rather
overbearing
otherwise
this
seems
like
an
overall
solid
beer
and
a
welcomed
addition
to
allagashs
yearround
portfolio
this
is
a
notappealing
version
of
a
saison
the
typical
belgian
yeast
flavors
are
over
the
top
and
ruined
it
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
but
will
not
get
again
o
a
really
nice
saison
incredibly
light
and
void
of
much
flavor
im
surprised
too
because
i
heard
this
was
a
decent
beer
remarkably
wellbrewed
for
balance
allagash
saison
is
an
elegant
example
of
the
style
that
shouldnt
be
passed
by
tasty
brew
not
sure
why
this
doesnt
have
a
higher
rating
if
we
are
rating
beers
within
their
category
its
clear
this
saison
is
superior
to
most
others
im
writing
this
review
on
what
is
not
only
one
of
the
darkest
longest
nights
of
the
night
but
also
the
coldest
so
far
this
winter
stand
outside
my
door
and
any
exposed
skin
will
succumb
to
frostbite
in
less
than
10
minutes
i
guarantee
it
and
yet
allagash
saison
summons
in
one
sip
the
sun
and
warmth
the
green
grass
and
fragrant
flowers
all
the
joys
of
spring
and
summer
overall
for
a
beer
out
of
the
standard
lineup
this
is
rather
impressive
not
a
top
flight
saison
but
this
would
go
really
well
with
food
brooklyn
bergn
on
draft
way
too
cold
when
served
became
a
solid
saison
with
the
brewerys
distinctive
quality
not
funky
enough
to
be
among
the
best
overall
some
strong
impressions
here
but
in
terms
of
flavor
the
most
important
aspect
this
beer
is
straining
to
meet
the
mark
i
bought
this
to
try
a
saison
and
at
first
i
wasnt
crazy
about
it
tried
to
make
sure
it
was
in
the
55
degree
range
when
serving
but
i
think
it
got
colder
than
i
wanted
which
ended
up
being
a
pretty
important
part
of
this
beer
both
my
wife
and
i
thought
it
was
okay
until
it
warmed
up
a
bit
and
then
it
was
excellent
my
recommendation
is
to
make
sure
you
have
it
in
the
5565
degree
range
when
drinking
not
colder
overall
super
refreshing
and
light
and
delicate
nothing
groundbreaking
but
a
great
summer
brew
and
something
to
pair
well
with
meals
overall
a
good
saison
from
allagash
hell
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
experience
from
this
brewer
worth
a
try
pours
a
nice
light
golden
and
hazy
color
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
golden
strong
ale
thick
thumb
length
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
white
lace
that
orbits
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
i
detect
apples
and
especially
pear
as
well
as
honey
taste
is
spicy
and
yeasty
with
a
bitter
hops
and
dry
finish
carbonation
is
lively
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
despite
the
light
color
this
ale
is
quite
full
bodied
a
nice
saison
that
i
will
have
again
o
theres
more
than
enough
complexity
to
keep
this
beer
interesting
but
its
shining
points
are
its
approachabilty
and
drinkability
while
all
the
hallmarks
of
the
saison
style
are
here
it
doesnt
stray
off
in
the
more
musty
funky
or
phenolic
directions
that
drive
some
of
the
more
beloved
examples
of
the
style
i
e
fantome
dupont
etc
thats
a
good
thing
as
it
means
the
neophyte
and
veteran
beer
geek
alike
can
pick
this
up
and
find
something
to
like
its
highly
quaffable
and
refreshing
to
boot
this
would
be
a
fine
choice
year
round
but
it
would
make
for
an
especially
good
summer
slugger
o
a
boilerplate
citrusy
saison
with
big
flavours
authentic
belgian
character
and
excellent
drinkability
great
quaff
o
very
solid
saison
recommended
o
a
nice
saison
with
a
lot
of
citrus
fruit
character
does
with
ample
amounts
of
pepper
and
light
phenols
good
but
in
the
second
group
overall
good
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
saisons
out
there
a
favorite
style
of
mine
i
like
to
try
new
variations
on
it
when
i
can
poured
with
a
huge
fine
offwhite
longlasting
head
lots
of
lace
and
a
hazy
yellow
color
aroma
is
fruit
yeast
crackers
flavor
is
dominated
by
carbonic
tang
and
yeast
flavors
a
little
fruit
quite
bitter
only
a
hint
sweet
excellent
body
wouldve
been
better
overall
if
the
bitterness
wasnt
overplayed
pale
straw
colored
mildly
cloudy
smells
like
a
belgian
highly
carbonated
which
i
like
i
prefer
an
earthierpepperyer
saison
this
one
leads
lemony
and
its
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
but
those
flavors
come
through
in
the
end
overall
a
good
saison
from
a
wonderful
brewery
pours
a
pale
gold
yellow
with
a
lasting
medium
white
head
some
lacing
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
wheat
citrus
hops
taste
is
sweet
citrus
wheat
coriander
herbal
and
spiced
hops
palate
is
a
medium
body
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
belgian
yeast
bready
citrus
coriander
with
some
good
spiced
hops
for
balance
a
refreshing
crisp
and
enjoyable
brew
to
drink
overall
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
saison
to
drink
for
a
long
time
not
my
favorite
saison
but
serviceable
nonetheless
herbal
grassy
mild
tart
citrus
and
a
bit
of
funky
barnyard
nice
head
and
beautiful
lacing
that
crowned
my
tulip
glass
throughout
love
that
amazingly
fruity
nose
with
excellent
balance
full
of
notes
that
contain
cereal
as
well
as
lemon
have
to
compliment
them
on
how
well
the
beer
is
made
the
head
is
flawless
and
lingers
for
a
long
time
very
well
made
some
other
notes
of
bubblegum
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
beautifully
malty
with
a
complex
backbone
of
hop
that
is
so
amazingly
well
done
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
balanced
beers
i
have
ever
had
a
great
saison
the
color
is
far
more
hazy
than
ive
ever
experienced
before
at
least
in
a
lighter
color
ale
i
dont
find
the
opacity
unappealing
or
anything
just
very
interesting
very
creamy
medium
body
medium
high
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
i
want
another
mostly
good
and
very
little
bad
in
this
saison
there
is
nothing
amazing
about
this
but
the
flavors
are
complex
especially
as
it
warms
very
solid
beer
that
i
will
have
again
starting
things
off
with
an
everyday
allagash
that
has
taken
me
far
too
long
to
try
it
pours
a
partially
hazy
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
mild
pineapple
syrup
coriander
light
cracked
wheat
belgian
yeast
and
a
hint
of
cobweb
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
my
tongue
enlivened
with
strong
veins
of
tropical
fruits
and
mild
spice
rack
denizens
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
rather
tasty
saison
straight
up
nuff
said
very
floral
and
fruity
i
see
this
as
being
above
average
but
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
crisp
refreshing
and
complex
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
brews
ive
had
in
awhile
pours
a
big
head
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
very
faintly
of
yeast
color
is
light
straw
and
somewhat
hazy
tastes
of
tropical
fruit
and
unsurprisngly
theres
hardly
any
hoppiness
to
it
yep

d
id
say
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
saison
and
one
that
i
will
continue
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
thats
nice
if
relaxed
is
your
way
to
rock
saison
allagash
saison
can
go
on
your
list
odrinkable
and

more
like
a

along
with

farmhouse
flavors
wake
up
as
the
brew
warms
dry
and
slightly
tart
wheat
finish
flavors
of
straw
in
the
finish
as
well
nice
brew
easy
drinking
on
a
warm
day
solid
offering
not
spectacular
overall
pretty
enjoyable
a
touch
more
citrus
than
i
want
and
not
as
much
of
the
yeast
character
as
i
like
ill
drink
it
if
out
but
hard
to
buy
this
instead
of
dupont
or
something
in
that
league
while
at
the
beer
store
overall
definitely
better
when
warmer
a
bit
too
lemony
but
sturdy
and
farmhouse
like
without
too
much
funk
bright
white
head
around
half
a
finger
and
it
sizzles
off
quickly
lacks
density
no
stick
in
the
lacing
but
there
are
broad
sheets
which
slide
down
the
glass
sides
light
yellowish
liquid
slightly
washed
out
but
it
has
good
shine
lots
of
active
bubbles
fill
the
glass
snow
globe
level
fullness
while
the
nose
has
some
brine
and
pickled
aspects
opens
into
softer
floral
notes
with
sour
white
citrus
and
clove
coriander
citrus
there
is
bubblegum
but
it
never
quite
enunciates
strongly
the
peach
apricot
and
curiously
pineapple
fruit
scents
crushed
into
the
whole
ends
with
a
yeast
dough
elevation
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
lives
up
to
its
visual
impression
and
churns
through
the
mouth
especially
creamy
attack
the
tangerine
white
grapefruit
citrus
plays
a
big
role
fewer
flowers
more
grains
and
metal
shavings
these
push
back
the
banana
bubblegum
and
lees
aspects
to
the
end
in
the
end
it
is
bit
too
tough
minded
and
lacking
in
flow
however
the
basic
elements
are
there
and
the
funk
seems
to
be
managed
for
maximal
approachability
by
the
widest
group
of
imbibers
o
this
is
another
well
made
beer
from
allagash
totally
worth
checking
out
a
very
generic
seeming
saison
for
allagash
to
be
putting
out
the
only
real
unique
feature
of
it
is
its
slightly
more
malt
heavy
base
the
yeast
is
not
the
only
flavor
agent
as
the
grain
is
more
here
than
the
usual
white
wheat
base
its
got
some
toast
and
sugar
too
it
which
is
nice
i
think
with
the
very
familiar
yeast
strain
in
this
beer
only
a
little
hazy
and
a
little
more
orange
than
blonde
but
somewhere
in
between
the
head
is
nice
on
it
but
it
doesnt
last
real
long
the
smell
and
taste
are
the
some
thin
and
winey
from
the
yeast
its
not
as
developed
or
interesting
as
some
but
the
sturdy
grain
base
is
welcomed
finish
is
dry
and
clean
and
carbonation
is
fine
but
i
wish
the
beer
had
just
a
little
more
body
to
go
with
its
richer
grain
character
decent
brew
overall
for
sure
but
knowing
what
allagash
is
capable
of
especially
in
the
farmhouse
style
this
one
seems
a
little
bland
my
first
beer
from
allagash
once
again
go
with
a
craft
or
smaller
local
brew
and
you
cant
miss
good
yankee
beer
i
have
had
this
several
times
but
never
in
the
right
vessel
until
now
a
duvel
fat
tulip
glass
made
the
world
of
a
difference
letting
it
flow
and
air
out
lightly
and
just
right
giving
enough
head
room
and
letting
the
saison
style
breathe
many
saisons
i
have
had
were
easy
in
regular
beer
glasses
but
this
babe
needed
a
little
more
tlc
and
with
that
my
appreciation
grew
overall
a
solid
if
not
mindblowing
saison
as
far
as
standard
no
extra
hops
no
additives
no
souring
saisons
go
id
probably
reach
for
this
one
over
most
but
the
shelves
it
sits
on
are
just
a
bit
too
far
away
for
me
to
reach
with
any
regularity
still
allagash
knows
how
to
do
some
belgian
styles
im
a
bit
surprised
the
only
recently
started
brewing
a
saison
nice
for
a
cool
summer
night
on
the
beach
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
refreshing
take
on
the
style
that
had
good
flavors
that
worked
well
together
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
a
swirl
of
the
glass
rejuvenates
the
head
aroma
is
excellent
with
plenty
of
citrus
fruit
hay
and
strong
peppery
spice
pepper
comes
through
in
the
flavor
medium
bodied
with
a
very
dry
mouthfeel
not
the
most
truetostyle
saison
it
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
funk
but
an
above
average
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
good
and
solid
saison
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
this
brewery
overall
this
beer
is
a
stand
out
example
of
a
saison
it
is
a
true
benchmark
for
its
respective
beer
style
it
is
also
an
easy
to
aquire
shelf
beer
that
is
reasonably
priced
a
very
very
under
rated
saison
in
my
personal
opinion
allagash
really
knocked
this
beer
out
of
the
park
its
a
home
run
allagash
saison
is
running
on
all
cylinders
it
smells
really
really
good
the
flavor
is
balanced
and
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
exceptional
its
a
classy
beer
that
is
a
great
stand
alone
on
hot
day
to
quench
your
thirst
or
a
perfect
companion
for
snacking
with
cheese
crackers
or
your
beer
to
go
with
a
full
course
meal
i
am
definately
grabbing
another
4
pack
of
this
beer
very
soon
because
the
other
3
bottles
from
the
4pack
will
not
last
very
long
a
solid
american
take
on
a
saison
well
worthwhile
this
was
quite
a
disappointment
coming
from
allagash
i
enjoy
the
vast
majority
of
their
beers
and
assumed
this
would
be
no
different
but
i
was
sadly
mistaken
its
not
bad
but
its
a
mere
shadow
of
what
it
could
and
should
be
considering
the
pedigree
overall
allagash
does
it
again
like
their
white
and
their
dubbel
their
saison
is
perfectly
in
style
and
hard
to
improve
upon
the
pour
was
a
nice
very
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
fizzy
head
that
stuck
to
the
glass
the
smell
had
really
nice
malt
and
wheat
with
a
bite
from
the
hops
the
taste
was
very
dry
in
the
beginning
with
hints
of
spice
and
wheat
cut
through
for
the
finish
the
moutfeel
was
very
nice
for
the
summer
ill
probably
pick
up
another
4
pack
before
its
gone
on
tap
at
acbf
this
was
a
bright
golden
colour
with
a
nice
tight
white
lacing
bright
florals
with
a
very
nice
yeasty
character
coming
through
body
is
full
and
very
balanced
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
and
would
seek
it
out
again
strong
take
on
the
style
nice
bright
citrus
character
balanced
with
a
yeasty
spiciness
o
really
nice
and
refreshing
saison
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
good
and
it
came
through
and
delivered
i
will
buy
this
again
and
im
actually
looking
forward
to
another
one
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
at
ye
ole
spirits
outstanding
appearance
on
the
beer
a
little
thin
in
color
but
great
head
that
grabbed
the
glass
nailed
the
taste
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
saison
if
not
overly
interesting
actually
surprised
that
it
was
over
6
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
hope
to
have
this
beer
many
times
in
the
future
cheers
as
a
hoppy
summer
saison
allagash

done
a
good
job
similar

i

really
drinkable
beer
o
an

on

big

its
spiced

the
ginger

and
orange

are
all
noticeable
it
hides
its

easily

the
dryness

it
make
it
very

something
to
mull
over
if
yo
want
to
id
make
love
to
this
beer
if
i
could
o
a
very
complex

before

just
not

up
to

maybe
the

off

something
just

this
was
my
first
saison
many
years
ago
and
its
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
throttle
up
the
gravity
a
bit
and
its
a
killer
bspa
but
for
the
style
it
advertises
its
not
great
and
very
reliant
on
the
adjuncts
even
the
beers
from
ommegang
that
arent
outstanding
are
still
worlds
better
than
the
same
brews
from
a
lot
of
other
brewers
ommegang
just
brews
with
magic
and
the
hennepin
is
evidence
of
that
pretty
pale
color
fruitful
but
not
too
sweet
taste
and
a
smooth
finish

one
of
my
new
favorites
a
better

just
barely
this
beer
is
a

pleasant
this
beer
tastes
very
lemony
not
huge
fan
for
about
3
dollars
a
bottle
this
beer
is
cheap
in
comparison
to
other
belgian
beers
normally
5
and
up
however
it
doesnt
lack
in
complexity
and
character
it
is
owned
by
the
same
company
that
produces
beers
like
duvel
another
favorite
and
achouffe
so
thats
another
perk
of
known
quality
this
would
go
well
with
many
different
food
pairings
i
think
pairing
this
beer
with
something
equally
spicy
would
work
well
such
as
some
excellent
cured
meats
like
hot
coppa
or
soppressata
again
for
the
price
this
beer
is
my
go
to
the
only
thing
that
isnt
perfect
is
that
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
gains
a
slightly
more
present
alcohol
hit
amplified
by
the
flavor
of
raw
ginger
that
detracts
from
all
of
the
other
great
flavors
it
isnt
terrible
however
i
did
have
to
mark
it
down
for
that
reason
however
i
still
give
it
98100
points
very
rich

to

substantial
enough
to

a
very

color
was
present
in
the
glass
at
first
but
cleared
up
some
as
it
sat

taste
is
very
vibrant
in
the
mouth
and
consists
of
several
zingy
citrus
fruits
a
light
hoppy
character
in
the
middle
with
a
reminiscence
of
wheat
grain
and
finishes
beautifully
in
a
cascade
of
flavors
that
dance
around
the
mouth
well
after
swallowing
personally
not
my
kind
of
flavored
but
a

of
care

attention
has
clearly
been
put
into
the

process
for
this
one

on

this

complex
yet
well
connected
and
easy
to
drink
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
dry
and
astringent
preserve
a
touch
more

the
overall

farmhouse
ale
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
spicy
medium
bodied
saison
more
yeast
than
im
used
to
very
good
floral
citrus
on
the
nose
bright
palate
with
lemon
coriander
ceylon
cinnamon
nutmeg
flavors
above
average
carbonation
pretty
clean
finish
maybe
a
little
lime
at
the
end
overall
solid
saison
not
necessarily
remarkable
in
any
category
but
very
good
overall
note
im
not
a
fan
of
a
big
grapefruit
presence
probably
because
i
dont
like
grapefruit
so
take
this
into
consideration
if
you
use
opinions
as
a
guide
gorgeous
deep
straw
colored
beer
with
a
dense
and
rocky
head
endless
strings
of
bubbles
feed
the
head
and
never
let
it
fade
great
lacing
down
the
glass
aromas
of
pears
apples
peppery
notes
citrusy
notes
a
touch
of
earthy
and
floral
hops
and
some
of
that
barnyard
funk
taste
follows
through
with
citrusy
orange
notes
mild
peppery
tones
floral
hop
flavor
tart
apple
and
belgian
fruity
yeast
flavors
mouthfeel
begins
creamy
with
ample
carbonation
that
finishes
super
dry
a
great
saison
one
to
have
again
for
sure
o
another
very
good
selection
from
ommegang
who
is
currently
averaging
a
wonderfully
high
rating
for
me
probably
the
most
consistent
and
highest
average
brewery
ive
reviewed
hennepin
must
be
my
least
favorite
beer
from
them
so
far
but
it
is
still
a
very
good
brew
that
would
be
nice
to
drink
on
a
mild
summer
afternoon
overall
a
great
american
saison
the
pepper
and
dryness
is
heavier
then
i
expected
but
this
overall
is
a
slow
sipper
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
it
think
it
would
work
with
a
lot
of
spicy
foods
actually
its
probably
even
better
when
combined
with
food
than
on
its
own
o
overall
this
beer
was
good
but
wasnt
a
stand
out
by
any
means
this
is
the
only
saison
ive
ever
had
so
maybe
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
would
give
this
beer
another
go
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
being
one
of
the
first
saisons
i
have
critiqued
i
found
it
pretty
good
if
anything
a
little
too
spicy
for
my
liking
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
with
a
saison
just
a
little
bit
of
sweet
and
spice
up
front
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
at
the
finish
enough
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
through
the
whole
pint
strong
but
still
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
relatively
high
abv
but
did
not
taste
of
alcohol
would
definitely
get
this
again
this
beer
was
bought
for
9
19
at
hennessey
grocery
in
butte
montana
which
continues
to
bring
variety
and
exotica
to
beer
drinkers
in
our
corner
of
the
mountains
the
price
is
at
least
2
dollars
below
belgian
imports
of
a
similar
quality
for
sale
in
the
store
upon
sipping
is
where
the
orange
peel
kicks
in
and
everything
else
that
was
on
the
nose
falls
into
place
for
a
creamy
biting
saison
that
embodies
its
listed
ingredients
very
well
ending
is
an
earthy
sum
of
all
the
ingredients
sharp
biting
some
minerals
not
complex
to
me
but
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
well
enough
overall
what
else
can
i
say
this
is
simply
a
fantastic
saison
and
a
perfect
representative
of
the
style
everything
you
want
is
here
yeast
spice
light
fruits
and
its
bold
effervescent
and
dry
a
must
try
notes
a
beautiful
beer
just
to
look
at
it
does
not
let
you
down
and
any
category
o
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
refreshing
and
drinkable
while
maintaining
a
good
amount
of
complexity
this
saison
stands
out
to
me
for
its
lightness
and
the
grape
and
wine
characteristics
its
a
beer
i
could
drink
on
the
hottest
of
days
and
still
enjoy
prost
this
is
an
excellent
ale
the
flavor
is
complex
and
makes
you
yearn
for
another
drink
the
aroma
is
sweet
overall
and
really
inviting
i
highly
recommend
drinking
this
ale
overall
im
not
quite
as
versed
in
my
saisons
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
very
refreshing
o
definitely
a
good
one
although
i
have
to
say
that
at
this
point
saison
and
tripel
are
both
falling
in
preference
next
to
dubbels
and
quads
i
can
certainly
appreciate
this
one
but
i
may
be
trending
away
from
the
style
as
a
whole
o
this
is
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
full
of
interesting
spiciness
very
complex
without
being
cloying
world
class
overall
such
a
good
tasting
refreshing
beer
for
some
reason
i
didnt
like
the
beer
when
i
first
had
it
no
idea
why
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
saison
if
your
a
fan
of
saisons
i
would
definitely
put
it
on
a
to
drink
list
it
poured
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
average
carbonation
and
little
lacings
it
has
malty
wheat
and
hops
infused
taste
with
strong
accents
of
orchard
fruits
i
t
has
a
malt
aroma
that
fades
quickly
and
goes
down
smouth
and
leaves
the
mouth
dry
it
has
a
little
edge
with
a
light
after
taste
and
is
somewhat
filling
great
beer
over
all
in
my
opinion
im
not
the
hugest
saison
fan
but
this
beer
is
fantastic
so
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
just
watch
out
for
the
abv
it
can
hurt
you
excellent
overall
this
beer
was
rated
without
any
financial
bias
however
the
pleasure
it
provided
was
frighteningly
affordable
if
i
were
to
ever
drink
this
with
a
buddy
wed
certainly
need
two
bottles
because
im
not
sharing
mine
still
on
a
hot
day
and
your
dollar
id
have
another
in
a
heartbeat
let
it
also
be
known
that
i
have
immense
respect
for
the
gang
and
love
many
of
their
beers
saison
is
the
wild
card
of
styles
and
one
mans
thirst
slaker
might
be
anothers
ambrosia
as
there
seems
to
be
no
clear
consensus
on
what
this
style
really
is
overall
this
is
just
a
really
welldone
americanmade
saison
its
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
a
stellar
ommegang
lineup
and
one
that
i
will
frequently
grab
just
on
a
whim
when
im
looking
for
a
solid
saison
that
isnt
tank
7
as
alstrom
wrote
close
to
champagne
but
so
much
more
at
a
dinner
party
see
if
people
prefer
over
wine
i
do
o
its
good
i
dont
think
ive
had
anything
from
ommegang
that
i
didnt
like
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
not
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
regularly
prost
overall
really
good
beer
that
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
as
dry
and
crisp
as
my
favorite
saisons
but
still
quite
enjoyable
a
must
try
o
amazingly
refreshing
and
perfect
for
a
hot
day
this
has
all
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
a
non
wild
yeast
saison
a
benchmark
to
measure
others
by
even
more
so
than
dupont
in
my
opinion
a
must
try
hennepin
should
be
a
goto
saison
for
anyone
in
ommegangs
distribution
area
if
you
like
a
classic
saison
like
dupont
youll
like
this
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
wheat
beers
you
will
love
this
im
sure
of
it
cheers
opinion
amazing
similar
to
tank
7
maybe
better
i
was
worried
a
little
because
of
all
the
adjuncts
coriander
ginger
orange
peel
but
the
balance
is
perfect
the
medley
is
hard
to
detect
and
many
sips
are
necessary
to
fully
appraise
the
individual
flavors
are
elusive
and
fleeting
buy
it
again
oh
yesss
a
more
thorough
examination
is
needed
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
lasts
for
a
bit
moderate
lacing
big
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
with
notes
of
yeast
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
along
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
this
is
such
a
good
saison
it
leaves
me
thinking
of
warmer
weather
and
hoping
for
another
glass
soon
overall
a
lovely
beer
very
refreshing
delicious
and
beautiful
to
look
at
available
at
a
decent
price
not
an
easy
beer
to
get
where
i
live
but
will
pick
it
up
when
i
travel
to
another
city
o
i
agree
with
ajzbedo
in
that
this
would
be
great
to
pop
the
cork
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
refreshing
and
flavorful
in
the
bread
department
it
can
even
at
times
remind
me
of
caraway
ie
pumpernickel
id
say
im
a
fan
its
reasonably
priced
too
original
reviewed
on
103013
what
a
wonderful
saison
id
love
to
buy
some
bottles
and
watch
as
they
all
develop
over
time
in
spite
of
the
apparent
freshness
dates
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
underrated
saisons
brewed
in
the
country
and
im
at
guilt
myself
as
ive
spent
so
much
time
running
after
the
more
hyped
or
limited
ones
while
this
would
gather
dust
on
shelves
wherever
id
go
highly
recommended
for
saison
lovers
a
domestic
offering
thats
up
there
with
my
favorites
from
belgium
o
this
is
my
second
go
around
with
ommegang
first
time
wasnt
great
abbey
ale
but
they
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
from
start
to
finish
i
loved
everything
about
this
beer
i
probably
would
rate
higher
if
it
were
95
degrees
in
july
instead
of
2
degrees
in
february
great
hot
summer
ale
i
highly
recommend
o
good
saison
but
the
ginger
is
a
bit
overpowering
at
times
o
im
not
the
worlds
biggest
saison
fan
but
this
proved
to
be
a
great
choice
the
spicy
orange
peel
tartness
mellowed
perfectly
on
the
palate
i
would
drink
this
again
easily
drinkable
and
sessionable
if
you
can
find
it
at
the
right
price
paired
well
with
a
neapolitan
margherita
pizza
with
a
little
black
truffle
oil
on
top
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
great
example
of
the
style
will
have
again
worth
seeking
out
enjoy
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
tons
of
head
nice
soapy
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
wheat
and
banana
in
the
nose
there
is
a
hint
of
spice
notes
as
well
tastes
of
sweet
malt
spices
whole
wheat
and
definitely
more
than
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
is
a
very
refreshing
wheat
beer
although
i
feel
its
a
little
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
drinkability
very
tasty
and
drinkable
cloying
saisons
drive
me
crazy
the
evenhanded
ones
like
this
make
me
appreciate
the
style
and
brewing
skill
well
done
great
beer
o
a
great
slightly
nontraditional
wheat
beer
had
this
blind
with
tank
7
and
that
beer
won
out
by
a
bit
this
just
didnt
have
enough
refreshing
notes
and
was
a
bit
sweet
overall
tasty
beer
full
of
big
flavor
i
really
liked
the
lively
carbonation
great
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
crisp
the
head
is
impressively
big
and
fluffy
aromatic
cant
think
of
anything
bad
to
say
other
than
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
expensive
ill
admit
off
the
bat
that
i
overpoured
this
little
more
foam
than
id
like
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
light
in
color
w
white
foam
smell
is
appealing
and
complex
taste
many
distinct
flavors
and
reminds
me
of
a
few
belgian
ales
i
have
had
still
smooth
and
rich
without
etoh
burn
a
very
enjoyable
beer
might
be
better
on
hot
summer
day
vs
winter
warmer
o
great
example
of
a
saison
for
those
just
testing
the
craft
waters
served
in
a
chilled
glass
poured
from
a
bottle
this
is
a
very
nice
i
would
certainly
have
again
o
very
good
beer
i
would
suggest
this
during
spring
and
summer
i
bought
this
for
a
snowy
maine
night
and
i
think
my
choice
might
have
been
better
with
something
a
bit
heavier
purchased
at
total
wine
in
naples
florida
for
9
99
for
the
4
pk
even
tho
not
a
fan
of
saison
or
weiss
style
beers
its
better
than
most
i
have
tried
so
i
rate
it
near
4
overall
easily
my
favorite
example
of
this
style
so
far
complex
refreshing
and
delicious
works
well
during
any
season
the
orange
peel
is
very
apparent
and
the
grains
of
paradise
and
coriander
add
a
spicy
complexity
thats
great
with
the
belgian
yeast
the
tanginess
and
hints
of
citrus
add
even
more
to
the
depth
of
this
beer
i
really
enjoy
ommegang
beers
and
this
is
another
to
add
into
my
rotation
list
o
a
very
good
farmhouse
ale
i
have
a
very
strong
urge
to
have
another
right
away
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
ales
from
ommegang
working
in
the
brewing
business
not
much
needs
to
be
said
about
this
classic
brewery
from
cooperstown
n
y
my
sous
chef
and
i
enjoyed
many
saisons
one
recent
evening
one
being
a
dupont
and
i
really
liked
the
n
y
brew
better
the
color
aroma
and
mouth
feel
were
all
what
you
would
expect
from
a
classic
farmhouse
ale
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
give
it
high
marks
for
accuracy
and
execution
i
would
highly
recommend
o
my
first
saison
and
certainly
a
style
i
will
continue
to
explore
off
the
back
of
this
experience
while
7
7
abv
isnt
super
high
its
a
good
fraction
higher
than
your
average
beer
and
this
beer
carries
the
load
with
no
stoop
in
its
shoulders
a
trait
i
must
always
commend
if
this
serves
as
an
exemplar
for
saisons
then
for
me
that
means
i
ought
expect
a
sort
of
musty
wheaty
belgian
ale
with
a
casual
attitude
towards
carbonation
if
this
beer
were
cheaper
it
would
be
highly
sessionable
but
as
it
stands
while
enjoyable
i
probably
wouldnt
pay
10
for
a
bomber
again
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
top
notch
belgians
weizenbocks
and
hefeweizens
for
less
this
is
an
enjoyable
saison
but
lacking
the
big
taste
of
the
best
of
the
style
o
a
solid
farmhouse
ale
and
quite
a
steal
at
6
19
a
bottle
although
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
this
one
in
the
summer
the
hennepin
was
bottle
conditioned
so
it
poured
with
plenty
of
head
and
a
majestic
golden
hue
once
i
fought
through
the
head
to
get
a
taste
i
was
rewarded
with
a
beer
that
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
but
was
very
light
on
the
palate
which
is
as
advertised
there
were
citrusy
notes
that
added
a
bit
of
pep
on
the
tongue
and
created
an
allaround
excellent
beer
overall
hadnt
had
this
one
in
a
while
and
was
worried
it
may
have
dropped
off
in
quality
since
i
last
did
have
it
was
happy
to
find
that
was
not
the
case
excellent
interesting
and
wonderfully
drinkable
saison
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
a
friend
lots
of
things
happening
in
the
glass
make
this
an
interesting
drink
just
a
tad
too
much
sting
from
the
carbonation
for
my
taste
but
overall
a
beer
worth
trying
d
very
pleasant
nice
just
nice
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
it
is
good
though
not
my
favorite
saison
but
id
have
it
again
fantastic
fantastic
beer
great
saison
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
could
enjoy
any
time
of
year
any
time
of
day
fantastic
odor
and
fantastic
taste
has
an
amazing
mouth
feel
and
one
of
the
best
farmhouses
i
have
ever
had
everything
i
have
had
at

amazing

but
soft
carbonation
so
its
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
brew
a
lot
ive
had
hennepin
in
the
past
but
its
been
a
very
long
time
since
the
last
time
i
tried
it
i
dont
think
it
will
be
as
long
of
a
wait
until
the
next
time
i
drink
some
7
49
a
bottle
a
fantastic
example
of
this
style
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
not
quite
as
good
as
boulevards
tank
7
saison
but
worth
picking
up
overall
a
great
saison
that
delivers
nuanced
yeast
character
and
adjunct
flavor
zesty
citrusy
biscuity
and
very
thirst
quenching
o
good
beer
good
saison
im
happy
with
it
overall
light
and
fresh
like
a
witbier
but
more
hoppy
and
crisp
never
cloying
perfect
summer
brew
o
excellent
beer
i
really
do
like
this
beer
if
my
scores
seem
a
little
low
it
may
be
because
i
am
new
to
rating
things
on
beer
advocate
so
i
am
trying
to
leave
room
at
the
top
end
for
future
reviews
overall
very
tasty
particularly
in
the
summertime
and
definitely
a
purchase
worth
repeating
feels
like
i
might
as
well
be
drinking
champagne
very
elegant
beer
would
love
to
try
this
again
i
had
this
at
the
harvard
club
of
nys
saison
tasting
it
was
poured
from
750ml
bottles
it
was
straw
in
color
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
substantial
sized
head
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
where
the
first
things
to
hit
my
nose
the
taste
was
spicy
yeast
and
again
sweet
malt
the
finish
is
dry
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
heat
o
a
refreshing
beer
i
have
really
enjoyed
saisonfarmhouse
beers
this
summer
and
it
took
a
while
for
this
one
to
reach
my
area
but
it
was
worth
the
wait
a
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
hennepin
is
a
go
to
for
me
now
o
its
been
years
since
ive
had
this
and
it
makes
me
wonder
why
i
havent
revisited
it
in
so
long
an
excellent
saison
that
should
hook
newcomers
to
the
style
instantly
taste
palate
very
bright
flavor
nice
finish
and
mouthfeel
really
flavorful
saison
pours
a
lightly
hazy
blondish
ale
with
a
towering
foam
head
that
eventually
fades
with
heavy
lacing
on
the
glass
sides
smells
of
coriander
some
sweet
orange
spicy
phenolics
and
spicy
esters
tastes
dry
and
spritzy
with
an
even
bitterness
firm
yet
not
too
assertive
spiciness
from
yeast
coats
the
tongue
drinks
easy
dry
medium
light
excellent
beer
seems
like
it
came
straight
from
belgium
glad
to
have
this
brewery
in
the
states
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
and
i
think
its
pretty
close
to
being
as
good
as
saison
dupont
which
is
my
favorite
of
the
style
and
i
think
i
will
have
to
try
the
two
side
by
side
to
really
find
out
which
one
i
prefer
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
clean
not
filling
pretty
refreshing
and
the
flavors
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
i
think
its
a
great
summertime
saison
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
it
had
pretty
much
everything
that
i
look
for
in
a
good
saison
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
how
little
the
farmhouse
aspect
showed
up
i
wouldnt
mind
if
it
imparted
a
little
more
funk
and
typical
farmhouse
flavors
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
nice
saison
its
a
little
pricey
but
it
is
cheaper
than
saison
dupont
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
all
the
time
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
saisons
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
wasnt
so
impressed
with
their
belgian
pale
ale
but
this
beer
turned
out
pretty
damn
good
and
im
now
a
little
more
interested
in
checking
out
more
of
brewery
ommegangs
lineup
good
job
guys
i
really
enjoyed
this
saison
overall
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
these
farmhouse
saisons
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
just
a
bubbly
tasty
beer
m
light
body
with
some
chew
dry
moderate
carbonation
o
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
it
is
difficult
to
beat
the
price
and
availability
of
such
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
ommegang
makes
it
look
almost
easy
here
maybe
the
best
year
round
saison
imo
nicely
done
surprised
that
the
carbonation
was
as
aggressive
as
it
was
on
the
palate
based
on
the
appearance
but
there
are
several
things
going
on
with
the
beer
solid
execution
of
the
style
overall
not
my
favorite
saison
but
still
good
very
drinkable
o
a
great
balanced
beer
with
an
awesome
appearance
and
smalland
it
tastes
great
lotas
of
yeasty
flavor
balanced
with
a
mild
backbone
and
a
pleasant
dry
finish
o
this
is
the
standard
of
the
style
in
the
eyes
of
many
people
and
i
see
why
hits
all
the
notes
that
a
saison
should
personally
i
prefer
my
saisons
with
some
tartness
and
fantome
is
still
the
epitome
of
the
saison
to
me
this
is
a
great
beer
though
deserving
of
the
beers
of
fame
list
my
lawn
tractor
is
broke
and
my
75
acre
lawn
is
six
inches
long
borrowing
my
neighbors
lawn
mower
with
a
broken
drive
i
had
to
push
temp
was
apx
85
f
and
sunny
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
after
mowing
feeling
like
a
farm
laborer
man
this
hit
the
spot
and
was
ever
so
refreshing
thoughts
kept
going
towards
how
this
really
compares
to
saison
dupont
my
first
saison
i
just
love
a
beckoning
saison
like
this
on
warmer
summer
sunny
daysgood
memories
to
have
very
flavorful
example
of
the
style
not
a
fan
of
banana
esters
and
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
a
refreshing
beer
plasticy
phenols
were
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
too
while
im
complainingi
find
the
carbonation
to
be
too
high
overy
refreshing
and
drinkable
for
the
abv
im
not
saison
expert
but
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
highly
recommend
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
4pack
because
this
was
really
alcoholic
smelling
and
tasting
didnt
have
any
of
the
subtlety
i
remember
tho
i
must
confess
its
probably
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
this
beer
boozy
and
so
overcarbed
it
was
impossible
to
pour
well
rjt
overall
i
love
saisons
and
this
is
a
decent
one
definitely
worth
a
try
amazing
flavor
complexity
and
balance
wonderful
overall
a
great
saison
rustic
yet
elegant
crisp
and
refreshing
lots
of
flavor
a
great
package
and
well
worth
the
price
o
great
beer
and
on
point
for
a
farmhouse
but
not
as
great
as
i
expected
mouthfeel
juicy
and
slightly
creamy
first
of
this
style
for
me
i
like
it
a
lot
clean
and
tight
a
beer
i
would
like
to
sip
floating
down
the
river
on
an
inner
tube
with
one
of
my
old
friends
not
an
expert
on
this
style
so
i
wont
act
like
it
however
i
know
beer
and
this
one
is
real
nice
boys
fantastic
saison
poured
with
a
very
nice
pure
white
head
golden
below
very
drinkable
and
good
lacing
aroma
is
top
notch
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
with
the
spices
coming
through
definite
citrus
notes
with
wonderful
warm
spices
coming
through
o
a
very
refreshing
saison
exactly
what
i
wanted
on
a
hot
night
like
tonight
the
flavors
could
be
a
bit
stronger
but
none
of
them
were
bad
a
good
brew
that
suits
the
style
well
but
i
can
find
less
expensive
beers
with
as
much
flavor
to
cool
me
off
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
and
a
beer
that
ive
gone
back
to
time
and
again
another
home
run
for
ommegang
this
experience
has
not
daunted
me
to
try
the
many
other
ommegang
offerings
or
even
a
fresher
example
of
hennepin
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
slightly
fizzy
though
never
prickly
or
painful
mouthfeel
that
settles
into
a
thin
blanket
of
foam
on
the
tongue
closes
fairly
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
head
retention
is
good
lacing
is
decent
has
the
funky
yeasty
fruity
aroma
a
little
more
hop
and
a
little
less
fruit
would
be
nice
strong
yeasty
funk
taste
with
very
fruity
aftertaste
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
good
still
would
prefer
a
little
more
hop
to
it
price
point
9
99
4pk
12oz
bottles
the
feel
is
very
full
and
the
massive
carbonation
dissipated
after
letting
it
sit
i
drank
this
cold
and
a
bit
warmer
and
found
it
better
refrigerated
overall
a
great
saison
probably
only
second
to
saison
dupont
in
my
opinion
seek
this
out
if
you
like
the
style
even
most
non
craft
beer
drinkers
will
like
this
o
this
is
similar
to
a
belgian
pale
ale
but
lighter
its
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
enjoyable
on
a
scorching
hot
day
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
refreshing
drink
but
you
certainly
dont
notice
as
youre
drinking
overall
not
a
particularly
complex
drink
but
definitely
one
id
have
again
overall
a
very
pleasant
saison
but
overall
nothing
terribly
special
i
was
a
teensy
bit
irritated
by
the
fact
that
i
had
to
fight
through
the
fizzy
head
to
get
to
the
liquid
no
matter
how
much
time
went
by
or
exactly
how
i
poured
the
brew
not
sure
i
would
seek
it
out
in
the
future
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
next
time
ill
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
to
avoid
the
foam
clouds
o
spot
on
for
the
style
ive
drank
this
many
many
times
and
it
always
tastes
fresh
and
inviting
an
awesome
saison
and
fantastic
american
take
on
a
belgian
ale
style
its
easy
to
see
why
its
so
popular
i
could
enjoy
this
anytime
but
like
people
say
its
especially
nice
in
the
sweltering
heat
overall
impression
well
crafted
and
well
worth
the
hype
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
can
understand
why
it
gets
good
press
served
in
a
samuel
adams
sensory
perfect
pint

hazy
straw
with
2
fingers
of
creamy
white

onto
a
foamy

that
lasts

clove
and
pepper
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
lots
of
belgian
yeast
character
tart
upfront
and
through
the
finish
nicely
balanced
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
effervescent
carbonation
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
well
balanced
and
extremely
flavorful
highly
recommended
hennepin
is
my
everyday
favorite
from
ommegang
its
a
lighthearted
somewhat
prickly
farmhouse
saison
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
great
big
head
that
lasts
laces
well
the
citrus
is
not
as
prominent
as
some
saisons
but
its
there
and
its
not
sour
earthy
flavors
lend
balance
to
the
forwardly
floral
hops
the
malt
exudes
a
tender
sweetness
thats
somehow
masculine
a
great
saison
easy
to
drink
mellow
a
little
peppery
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
in
the
glass
this
beer
is
equitable
and
upright
bravo
o
really
well
done
and
refreshing
overall
a
very
nice
saison
i
cant
believe
i
waited
this
long
to
try
it
very
drinkable
at
the
abv
would
recommend
overall
1st
time
for
me
and
im
a
fan
overall
well
balanced
extremely
flavorful
and
easily
available
saison
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
from
an
experienced
saison
drinker
to
someone
whos
just
getting
into
the
style
overall
a
tasty
farmhouse
o
wow
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
i
love
drinking
this
stuff
o
very
refreshing
and
a
bit
more
sour
sharp
and
bitter
than
i
remember
it
being
the
last
time
i
had
a
growler
of
it
i
think
i
like
hennepin
with
just
a
little
extra
bottle
conditioning
more
than
i
like
it
on
tap
ohighly
enjoyable
saison
that
does
not
disappoint
pick
up
a
750
or
4
pack
now
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
o
a
fantastic
belgian
farmhouse
saison
of
the
4
saisons
ive
had
this
is
certainly
up
there
among
the
best
of
em
highly
recommended
a
great
saison
a
true
class
act
nice
mix
of
earthy
and
musty
notes
in
the
mix
and
a
fair
bit
of
citrus
hops
i
am
a
fan
of
funky
saisons
but
this
does
a
good
job
having
a
good
complexity
and
profile
with
some
typically
musty
citrus
yeast
hazy
gold
with
a
gigantic
white
head
pour
it
into
a
16
ounce
glass
smells
like
yarrow
and
milkweed
like
an
overgrown
field
typical
of
saisons
flavours
of
coriander
yellow
curry
fresh
cut
grass
booze
you
have
to
like
saisons
to
appreciate
this
but
its
a
good
one
overall
this
ale
is
excellent
a
definite
keeper
of
the
belgian
brewing
tradition
overall
average
and
will
be
sticking
with
abbey
ale
from
ommegang
overall
this
just
took
over
tank
7
in
my
favorites
for
this
category
touche
ommegang
o
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
saison
id
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
but
im
not
going
to
go
crazy
over
it
yet
another
well
made
beer
from
ommegang
this
may
be
a
truly
great
quaff
but
saisons
are
not
my
favorite
just
a
corollary
to
explain
why
my
opinion
may
be
way
off
the
beer
pours
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
of
chunks
and
carbonation
bubbles
circling
around
the
beer
pours
with
a
nice
tight
white
head
on
it
that
settles
to
a
quarter
of
a
fingers
width
and
leaves
a
thin
lacing
of
tight
dry
bubbles
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
spiced
coriander
with
hints
of
orange
peel
and
ginger
there
is
also
distinct
bananay
yeast
in
the
background
giving
lovely
character
to
the
nose
while
the
hops
and
yeast
are
properly
downplayed
with
lights
notes
of
grass
and
hay
and
some
wheat
notes
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
creamy
sweet
and
grassy
bitter
with
lots
of
spice
character
the
flavor
begins
as
orange
peel
and
light
wheat
malt
before
being
steamrolled
away
by
heavy
coriander
spices
with
hints
of
pickling
ginger
this
moves
into
bitter
grassy
hops
and
banana
yeast
the
finish
gives
a
fresh
kiss
of
coriander
infused
orange
juice
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
wheat
bread
before
mellowing
into
an
aftertaste
of
light
coriander
spice
and
yeasty
banana
funk
in
the
mouth
the
beer
tastes
creamy
smooth
and
medium
in
body
with
a
touch
of
fierce
carbonation
that
mellows
into
a
clean
scrubbing
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
but
clean
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
interestingly
flavored
beer
theyre
a
little
heavy
handed
with
the
coriander
spicing
which
hurts
the
other
flavors
but
these
flavors
still
show
through
and
are
beautiful
and
fresh
in
feel
this
is
a
classic
american
saison
in
a
belgianstyle
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
saison
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
wow
me
its
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
really
surprise
or
excite
and
it
falls
short
because
of
the
way
some
notes
clash
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
steep
price
i
opened
this
bottle
in
march
but
i
have
read
that
it
is
really
refreshing
to
indulge
during
the
summer
months
i
do
think
this
beer
complements
well
with
all
seasons
drinking
it
right
now
felt
like
a
perfect
occasion
it
could
be
opened
on
a
cold
rainy
day
or
on
a
hot
sunny
day
best
drink
cold
before
the
beverage
warms
up
if
drinking
on
a
hot
day
overall
great
example
of
the
style
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
well
developed
flavors
and
depth
but
light
and
delicate
the
carbonation
and
zest
make
it
very
refreshing
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
in
the
summer
months

sweet
and

tasting

bitterness
right
at
the
end
awesome
for
the
summer
sun
true
to
the
style
and
an
appropriate
alcohol
level
mild
carbonation
flavor
is
in
balance
one
of
our
top
five
saisons
right
now
o
overall
it
looked
promising
but
since
its
a
part
of
the
duvel
family
i
am
not
surprised
that
it
is
highly
overrated
tastes
like
urine
plain
and
simple
o
a
nice
accessible
saison
great
saison
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
o
very
solid
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
try
more
saisons
definitely
worth
a
go
o
not
my
favorite
style
as
i
usually
enjoy
hoppier
beers
but
hennepin
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
representative
of
the
style
i
will
most
likely
drink
this
beer
again
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
good
i
would
rather
have
a
couple
of
the
other
saisons
instead
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
it
just
doesnt
really
leave
the
wow
impression
taht
i
look
for
out
of
a
beer
of
fame
this
is
nice
tasting
beer
light
and
refreshing
would
be
nice
in
the
summer
hides
its
abv
completely
othis
is
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
ever
new
or
old
world
ommegang
really
hits
on
all
cylinders
here
the
brew
is
good
looking
it
smells
nice
love
the
crisp
lemon
and
honey
the
taste
is
complex
and
the
feel
is
wellmatched
to
the
flavor
profile
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
a
really
good
beer
which
is
very
close
to
being
a
top
notch
beer
o
great
beer
lots
going
on
and
its
balanced
fairly
well
i
couldnt
sit
down
and
drink
more
than
a
couple
though
o
a
pretty
solid
belgian
ale
i
fell
in
love
with
saison
dupont
and
hold
all
other
saisons
to
that
standard
a
bit
on
the
fuller
body
sweet
side
that
i
didnt
care
for
too
much
o
overall
the
wait
paid
off
this
beer
is
a
bit
expensive
but
for
the
deal
i
got
its
in
amazing
gig
but
cost
aside
this
is
a
great
beer
i
mean
its
perfectly
balanced
rich
robust
and
smooth
all
at
the
same
time
great
with
food
excellent
craftsmanship
a
must
try
for
everyone
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
have
it
every
chance
i
get
but
when
i
finally
set
down
to
review
it
it
didnt
hit
the
style
notes
i
thought
it
would
its
perhaps
a
toocommercialized
version
of
a
saison
overall
liked
the
look
of
this
beer
and
actually
liked
holding
the
bottle
once
i
first
grabbed
it
something
told
me
this
was
going
to
be
a
special
one
and
boy
was
it
quite
disappointined
this
perticular
beer
isnt
widely
available
in
pa
but
im
sure
i
can
do
some
hunting
and
locate
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
interested
in
trying
a
traditional
saison

you
wanting

for
it

in
the
day
either
to
each

or

great
final
thoughts
an
enjoyable
saison
light
in
body
and
mild
in
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
because
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
nicely
balanced
if
fairly
tame
example
of
the
style
i
prefer
my
saisons
with
a
little
more
of
that
farmhouse
funk
to
them
very
good
beer
almost
similar
to
a
belgian
tripel
but
more
spicy
and
less
sweet
the
added
farmhouse
funk
on
the
tail
end
adds
a
different
elements
as
well
as
some
unidentifiable
fruit
very
pleasing
id
definitely
have
this
one
again

hennepin
is
a
quality
saison
that
really
nails
the
essential
flavor
hallmarks
of
the
style
and
while
it
doesnt
feature
anything
particularly
adventurous
creative
or
outlandish
its
still
quite
a
pleasant
beer
and
a
wonderful
introduction
to
the
style
that
i
would
recommend
either
hennepin
or
saison
dupont
to
those
who
have
never
had
a
belgianstyle
saison
is
a
testament
to
how
well
ommegangs
creation
stands
up
to
the
imported
examples
of
the
style
saison
dupont
being
a
paragon
of
the
saison
style
good
stuff
and
a
worthy
buy
when
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
tall
glass
maybe
the
wrong
choice
this
developed
a
very
tall
foamy
head
that
took
a
while
to
settle
overall
amazing
brew
seems
like
a
summer
beer
but
it
was
hearty
enough
to
also
enjoy
in
the
winter

definitely
one
of
the
better
american
renditions
of
the
style

it
looks
great

i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
try
right
now
went
very
well
with
tuna
casserole
and
overall
is
a
great
beer
fantastic
in
all
categories
i
will
have
to
get
it
again
to
see
how
it
is
when
i
pour
even
more
carefully
next
time
leaving
the
sediment
behind
o
this
one
is
certainly
refreshing
and
clean
i
will
be
enjoying
one
or
many
in
the
future
as
it
is
easy
to
consume
multiples
of
these
a
nice
saison
but
a
little
too
much
like
a
witbier
for
my
liking
could
use
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
overwhelming
yeast
flavor
ommegang
has
done
it
again
with
this
great
example
of
saison
nice
medium
carbonation
golden
wheat
color
substantial
head
and
crisp
taste
very
well
balanced
taste
alcohol
is

and
this
would
be
a

but
for
its
7
7
abv
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
the
label
says
they
are
part
of
the
duvel
family
i
found
this
quit
drinkable
and
it
is
too
hard
to
pin
this
style
so
enjoy
a
beer
that
calls
itself
the
true
belgianstyle
saison
it
better
be
good
o
this
is
damn
near
close
to
perfect
for
a
saison
in
my
books
light
and
refreshing
with
lively
flavors
im
so
glad
this
brewery
is
close
by
and
comparatively
cheap
they
really
put
out
high
quality
stuff
at
a
great
price
at
least
around
here
i
know
its
way
more
expensive
in
other
countiesstates
poured
into
an
ommegang
flute
glass
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
massive
white
head
with
great
retension
and
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
very
fruit
forward
with
orange

aroma
with

spicing
finishing
slightly
dry
with
the
saison
yeast
flavor
finally
making
its
presence
known
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
light
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
the
wild
yeast
element
seems
a
bit
tamed
down
from
belgian
saisons
but
the
other
flavors
are
so
great
that
it
hardly
matters
oa
delicious
farmhouse
ale
from
ommegang
in
the
classic
belgian
style
will
be
enjoying
a
lot
more
of
these
in
the
future
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
out
there
i
recommend
this
beer
thoroughly
the
belgian
yeast
on
display
here
is
wonderful
o
i
love
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
and
ive
had
many
from
its
home
country
of
belgium
for
a
long
time
now
american
brewers
havent
truly
understood
this
style
of
ale
ommegang
dont
pretend
to
brew
in
a
belgian
style
but
they
actually
do
brew
solely
in
a
belgian
style
they
give
american
craft
junkies
a
true
belgian
saison
brewed
and
bottled
right
here
in
the
united
states
and
hennepin
holds
true
to
the
authentic
farmhouse
style
if
you
want
the
best
american
made
saison
then
this
is
the
one
american
brewing
has
needed
a
farmhouse
ale
to
give
the
great
belgians
a
run
for
their
money
and
ommegangs
hennepin
is
that
saison
we
can
call
our
own
knowing
it
can
compete
pure
class
o
what
a
great
beer
i
actually
totally
was
not
expecting
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
i
love
the
saison
style
to
begin
with
who
am
i
kidding
i
love
just
about
every
style
and
i
love
ommegang
brewery
so
perhaps
i
was
being
naïve
in
thinking
i
wouldnt
enjoy
this
but
i
really
really
like
it
maybe
the
best
saison
ive
had
to
date
o
quite
good
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
my
curiosity
was
satiated
it
will
be
a
year
or
more
before
i
have
to
well
i
dont
want
to
unsettle
those
bits
of
yeast
right
now
so
quaff
able
i
quaffed
this
bottle
so
hard
in
positions
illegal
in
both
pennsylvania
and
utah
pours
bright
yellow
with
monster
head
smells
of
funk
spice
and
a
hint
of
citrus
nice
light
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
lemon
peel
belgian
yeast
and
some
pepperyginger
flavor
easy
drinking
and
nice
beer
this
is
easily
my
favorite
beer
from
the
big
o
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
and
the
sweet
yet
light
brew
is
so
nice
notes
complex
interesting
well
made
excellent
o
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
quite
tasty
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
with
good
complexity
and
flavor
notes
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
well
balanced
beer
that
has
complexity
drinkability
and
strength

ive

this

very

extremely
easy

and
pretty
cheap
too
check
this
one
out
overall
the
only
thing
that
needs
to
be
said
is
i
love
this
beer
amazing
from
first
sight
in
the
glass
its
complex
and
deep
scents
to
the
delicious
and
complimentary
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
is
amongst
the
most
perfectly
balanced
beers
ive
ever
had
good
mouth
feel
moderate
carbonation
creamy
butterscotch
with
farmhouse
brett
and
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
with
some
banana
honey
and
a
hint
of
bread
as
it
warms
a
nice
bitter
comes
through
on
the
finish
then
fades
nicely
very
clean
beer
a
touch
of
lemon
with
slight
alcohol
essence
on
occasion
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
saisonfarmhouse
in
the
usa
as
far
as
mass
producers
are
concerned
some
micro
out
west
might
have
a
better
one
but
as
far
as
a
big
time
producers
this
is
it
everything
is
right
on
smell
appearance
and
of
course
taste
it
has
the
classic
belgian
esters
you
get
with
the
farmhouse
yeast
strains
everyone
is
out
to
make
an
americanized
farmhousesaison
by
going
big
with
the
gravity
or
the
hops
or
more
unfortunately
both
true
saisons
are
not
overly
hoppy
and
are
modest
alcohol
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
them
from
going
bad
too
quickly
this
one
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
alcoholwise
to
really
be
a
real
traditional
saison
but
it
is
otherwise
on
the
money
saisons
were
brewed
to
refresh
the
seasonal
field
workers
in
wallonia
and
the
brews
were
generally
35
so
the
workers
could
have
one
and
still
finish
the
job
7
7
is
a
bit
too
high
to
be
a
true
traditional
saison
still
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
you
dont
like
saisons
overall
a
really
good
beer
unfortunately
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
i
like
this
beer
ommegang
is
a
really
good
brewery
most
of
their
beers
are
like
this
one
very
good
this
beer
is
hazy
orange
with
a
massive
white
head
aroma
is
breaddy
yeasty
and
spicy
there
is
also
a
nice
lemon
zest
character
to
this
beer
as
well
as
a
slight
dark
fruit
there
is
a
lot
of
wheat
flavor
and
feel
to
this
one
it
is
fruity
zesty
and
wheaty
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
at
first
but
gets
smoother
and
creamier
over
time
the
dark
fruit
and
the
wheat
flavors
work
well
together
and
are
constantly
changing
the
yeast
adds
a
spicy
character
and
feel
to
the
beer
this
is
a
nice
offering
by
ommegang
and
a
solid
saison
what
makes
this
beer
stand
out
is
the
distinctness
of
each
of
its
myriad
flavors
to
achieve
complexity
without
confusion
is
the
mark
of
fine
craftsmanship
i
take
my
hat
off
to
brewery
ommegang
for
delivering
an
outstanding
rendition
of
this
extremely
delicate
and
difficult
style
what
a
beer
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
thick
soapy
white
head
i
can
detect
plentiful
streaming
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
head
retreats
slowly
there
are
aromas
of
biscuit
from
the
malts
as
well
as
those
typical
spiced
and
fruity
belgian
ale
aromas
like
coriander
lemon
and
pear
the
beer
definitely
is
spicier
in
the
taste
that
in
the
nose
the
coriander
is
more
intense
and
its
somewhat
peppery
those
fruity
flavors
are
more
intense
being
pear
forward
the
hops
on
the
back
end
provide
some
bitterness
for
balance
the
body
is
medium
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
very
dry
for
the
style
this
is
solid
those
expected
notes
really
come
through
and
it
deserves
an
a
for
that
even
if
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
overall
4
25
this
is
a
really
solid
saisonalways
has
been
considering
how
light
and
dry
it
is
for
something
of
this
strength
you
can
get
a
very
good
sense
of
the
yeast
character
in
this
beer
which
i
like
itd
be
nice
to
have
some
more
head
retention
but
it
looks
good
enough
and
has
a
nice
nose
with
a
very
good
flavor
and
feel
its
not
transcendent
at
any
point
but
as
classically
styled
saisons
go
its
well
rounded
and

rusticclassic
farmhouse
style
excellent
o
this
beer
is
fairly
tasty
but
really
odd
for
the
style
its
also
been
aged
for
over
a
year
so
the
yeast
has
really
taken
over
the
beer
decent
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
though
i
have
admittedly
tried
very
few
o
its
a
decent
saison
but
it
seems
runofthemill
for
something
that
gets
so
much
love
still
it
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
easily
drinkable
color
is
golden
with
a
large
billowy
white
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
scent
is
primarily
fresh
cut
grass
with
some
freshy
baked
bread
too
the
taste
features
lemon
biscuit
and
earthy
grass
flavors
along
with
a
bit
of
tart
apple
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
in
the
taste
it
is
almost
winelike
excellent
mouthfeel
even
though
it
is
lightbodied
nice
complexity
and
a
fine
drinking
experience
a
very
well
done
saison
a
bit
pedestrian
compared
to
belgian
syle
i
was
just
there
but
hits
on
all
charachteristics
fresh
flavors
and
decent
depth
12oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
bodied
and
bright
pear
juice
gold
in
color
with
a
highly
carbonated
and
active
two
finger
bright
white
head
the
nose
is
light
and
yeasty
it
has
nice
white
orchard
fruit
character
like
sweet
apple
and
pear
the
flavors
follow
suit
it
has
a
light
slightly
sweet
fresh
fruitiness
to
pair
with
the
light
and
off
dry
belgian
yeast
its
very
well
rounded
and
has
great
flavor
it
drinks
light
in
body
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
a
saison
in
my
opinion
but
it
really
doesnt
detract
from
the
beer
at
all
this
is
a
light
easy
drinking
saison
and
you
dont
detect
any
of
the
7
7
at
all
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
it
o
though
this
is
not
my
usual
choice
of
beer
it
is
surprisingly
satisfying
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
lighter
kind
of
ale
with
character
even
now
i
am
still
curious
about
it
and
would
definitely
try
it
again
had
a
whole
keg
of
this
with
the
boys
this
week
pours
a
hazy
bright
yellow
colow
with
very
excited
carbonation
and
a
thick
bone
white
head
thats
lasts
forever
smells
farmy
like
wild
yeasts
and
wheat
malt
really
funky
nose
with
some
spice
as
well
flavor
is
equally
interesting
and
the
yeast
is
the
star
it
has
a
bitter
lemon
rind
component
and
a
peppery
barnyard
finish
excellent
saison
mouthfeel
is
magnificent
its
effervescent
carbonation
and
medium
unfiltered
body
make
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
abv
is
a
total
sneak
and
can
really
do
you
in
if
you
arent
careful
its
not
noticeable
at
all
overall
another
epic
brew
from
ommegang
o
i
had
tried
this
one
along
time
ago
and
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
now
with
a
more
developed
palate
i
can
appreciate
this
style
and
this
offering
by
ommegang
all
around
this
is
an
excellent
offering
for
this
style
and
the
complexity
is
rather
high
it
has
a
high
drinkability
and
has
a
great
finish
that
works
well
during
a
hot
summer
day
o
i
really
liked
the
mellowness
of
this
complex
masterpiece
the
rustic
flavors
and
balanced
tart
and
sweet
is
very
succulent
a
solid
saison
as
a
whole
this
is
a
very
nice
saison
bearing
all
of
the
common
flavors
in
decent
quantity
and
nuance
the
beer
does
seem
slightly
more
watery
than
the
7
7
abv
would
imply
but
at
the
same
time
the
relatively
high
abv
is
very
nicely
hidden
creating
a
strange
contrast
furthermore
the
bananaclove
and
sour
notes
slightly
overly
dominate
especially
if
several
sips
are
taken
in
quick
succession
still
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
in
the
saison
dupont
vein
i
usually
go
for
milder
saisons
but
i
can
respect
the
bolder
flavors
of
hennepin
m
light
leading
to
medium
pours
a
dark
golden
color
chunky
white
head
with
excellent
retention
grainy
smell
a
touch
of
sweetness
as
well
nice
delicate
spices
with
a
touch
of
honey
a
mild
fruity
tart
profile
and
dry
finish
this
is
the
most
popular
saison
on
ba
and
for
good
reason
its
got
a
great
taste
and
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
remains
remarkably
drinkable
a
belgian
noob
will
find
this
accessible
without
sacrificing
flavor
this
was
a
textbook
saison
in
my
opinion
ive
had
others
that
were
very
similar
but
the
level
of
quality
is
probably
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
others
m
thick
and
velvety
for
a
beer
of
its
colorgravitystrength
but
mixing
with
the
taste
it
just
feels
gross
it
is
sticky
and
slick
lingering
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
for
some
time
o
very
complex
very
balanced
lots
of
bright
fresh
flavors
pretty
darn
good
do
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
and
i
get
why
so
many
suggest
that
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
sometime
soon
i
hope
to
give
it
a
go
on
a
hot
summer
day
until
then
this
was
enjoyable
but
its
still
not
something
that
i
crave
when
the
weather
isnt
hot
overall
i
think
this
might
be
my
neverfail
go
to
beer
i
really
am
never
let
down
it
is
both
fulfilling
and
drinkable
and
it
combines
what
comes
best
in
so
many
different
styles
that
it
truly
is
a
no
brainer
if
you
want
a
saison
do
not
be
deceived
by
the
shelf
availability
of
this
beer
it
will
beat
many
of
the
best
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
damn
things
that
has
ever
entered
my
mouth
beer
or
otherwise
and
handsdown
the
best
saison
ive
tried
though
surly
cynic
comes
close
i
originally
wasnt
planning
on
reviewing
this
beer
but
it
was
so
ridiculously
good
that
i
felt
utterly
compelled
to
share
the
experience
picked
this
up
in
buffalo
pours
a
bright
hazy
golden
yellow
with
lots
of
white
head
tastes
slightly
of
lemon
and
grass
with
a
faint
spicey
finish
and
the
typical
belgian
pale
ale
mouthfeel
very
nice
overall
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
im
new
to
this
style
and
i
just
love
it
ive
recently
really
become
a
big
lover
of
belgians
and
this
one
is
wonderful
in
that
its
not
quite
as
strong
but
has
a
delicious
full
belgian
taste
and
smell
i
find
it
tangy
and
crisp
not
as
sharp
as
an
ipa
perfect
with
food
not
as
filling
as
hefes
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
this
dry
brew
is
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
and
easy
to
pour
another
the
mix
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
dry
finish
makes
this
a
refreshing
treat
uncomplicated
and
straight
froward

the
beer
has
a

that
disappears
fast
there
is
a
pronounced
yeasty
nose
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
much
less
sourness
than
some
of
this
style
there
is
some
tartness

there

the
taste
is
great

floral
spicy
hops
and
fruit

i
dont
get
the
banana
some
other
folks
talk
about
more
of
sweet

the

is
lots
of
carbonation
which
sort
of
takes
over
the
rest
of
the
body
with
a
very
crisp

a
very
excellent
beer
i
loved
this
beer
far
more
back
in
the
day
since
then
ive
had
a
wide
array
of
tasty
farmhouse
ales
but
this
is
a
trusty
classic
4

overall
one
of
my
favs
from
the
ommegang
lineup
would
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
who
likes
beer
with
flavor
one
of
the
more
belgiany
saisons
i
have
tried
o
an
in
your
face
version
of
this
style
not
my
favorite
example
but
its
up
there
this
is
a
solid
saison
it
doesnt
have
an
overpowering
yeast
presence
and
has
solid
balance
its
definitely
worth
trying
o
very
refreshing
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
sessionable
and
goes
down
well
on
a
warm
summer
dayevening
at
one
point
in
time
a
couple
of
years
back
this
was
my
favorite
beer
and
is
still
one
of
the
best

only
my

quenching
very
nice
mouthfeel
deserving
of
its
place
in
the
beers
of
fame
id
say
a
lovely
saison
that
pairs
very
well
with
food
or
alone
as
a
warm
weather
quencher
m
lots
of
activity
yet
fairly
light
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
during
a
break
from
yardwork
on
a
hot
saturday
afternoon
its
not
as
fruity
on
the
nose
as
id
like
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
spoton
for
this
style
moreover
its
extremely
easy
to
find
recommended
very
easy
going
down
pairs
perfectly
with
a
shrimp
scampi
would
highly
recommend
o
pretty
good
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of

and
this
is

love

im
bewildered
by
the

for
this

i
wont
finish
a

overall
a

if
a
bit
strong
id
get
it
again
probably
my
favorite
saison
to
date
and
one
that
i
hope
to
come
back
to
sometime
well
balanced

a
nice

o
very
good
saison
one
to
enjoy
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
nice
bold
and
complex
brew
the
spice
dominates
the
fruitiness
here
again
perhaps
due
to
the
age
of
this
bottle
even
so
this
is
a
good
overall
saison
i
was
annoyed
that
the
bottle
said
product
of
belgium
on
it
but
close
enough
geez
o
this
is
a
beer
that
i
love
to
get
whenever
i
get
the
chance
i
dont
see
it
too
often
but
it
sure
hits
the
spot
just
an
all
around
great
beer
o
this
beer
makes
me
smile
every
sip
is
just
delicious
complex
memorable
and
intense
at
just
the
right
moments
every

i
walked

i
can
understand
why
this
is
such
a
well
liked
brew
solid
in
every
aspect
but
i
would
not
put
it
among
the
best
of
its
style
o
pretty
much
outstanding
lots
of
flavors
going
on
and
melded
so
well
together
excellent
to
say
the
least
another
great
beer
from
ommegang
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
could
possibly
be
a
new
summer
favorite
for
me
cheers
i
dig
super
bubbly
bottle
conditioned
belgians
but
holy
crap
i
have
never
seen
so
many
bubbles
in
a
beer
it
settles
after
a
couple
minutes
though
and
makes
for
a
great

with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
blast
along
with
a
dry
tartness
improves
greatly
as
the
bottle
warms
into
the
60
degree
range
as
the
nose
flavors
and
alcohol
really
intensify
edit
ive
had
this
beer
again
many
times
with
a
good
amount
of
head
i
think
there
was
soapy
residue
in
the
glass
when
i
did
the
review
o
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
saison
style
having
only
had
saison
de
silly
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
funkier
and
out
of
normal
range
but
i
suppose
the
silly
is
an
exception
overall
a
nice
brew
that
i
will
be
enjoying
more
of
soon
o
hits
the
marks
nicely
all
around
good
drinking
beer
it
makes
feel
like
im
in
the
basement
of
the
thirsty
monk
in
asheville
overall
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
on
tap
it
came
to
the
table
and
smelled
like
a
citronella
candle
ive
been
putting
off
retrying
it
for
4
years
as
a
result
ultimately
im
sad
i
waited
this
is
a
damn
fine
american
take
on
a
nonamerican
style
nice
flavor
profile
with
a
decent
drinkability
funk
is
on
point
hennepin
has
an
impressive
appearance
not
just
the
golden
color
of
course
but
the
head
which
is
massive
and
longlasting
pouring
along
the
side
of
the
glass
will
not
even
help
one
bit
pour
slowly
very
nice
honeytoned
spicy
floral
aroma
though
theres
some
raw
honey
sweetness
as
well
the
taste
overall
is
nice
and
dry
lemony
and
herbal
all
very
well
integrated
in
the
mouth
smooth
stuff
this
bottle
was
brewed
in
belgium
the
label
says
wherever
they
wind
up
brewing
the
stuff
its
bound
to
be
a
classic
this
is
one
of
my
top
goto
beers
for
special
occasions
o
quite
tasty
saison
nice
floral
flavours
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
refreshing
ale
a
tasty
ale
indeed
and
worthy
of
seeking
out
o
despite
a
few
niggles
and
the
fact
that
it
seemed
past
its
prime
i
liked
this
generally
not
a
perfect
beer
but
i
really
think
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
would
be
a
significant
improvement
worth
a
try
o
not
bad
but
not
really
doing
it
for
me
either
goes
down
easy
enough
tastes
like
a
standard
belgian
pale
ale
to
me
will
probably
pass
on
this
in
the
future
d
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
bold
but
its
got
good
flavors
and
is
very
easy
drinking
id
have
it
again
doa
overall
yeah
just
that
good
salud
overall
b
not
a
big
fan
o
very
tasty
very
clean
and
dry
a
quite
good
saison
this
a
bright
yellow
almost
orange
color
with
a
1
finger
fizzy
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
bubbles
from
the
base
of
the
glass
smell
is
full
of
funk
with
hints
of
banana
and
sugar
little
earth
and
hop
tones
as
well
pretty
good
smelling
beer
taste
is
citrusy
with
some
floral
notes
very
dry
funk
at
the
end
taste
unlike
most
saisons
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
good
will
age
very
well
and
very
drinkable
o
top
tier
beer
from
a
top
tier
brewery
the
secondary
notes
in
this
beer
is
what
did
it
for
me
its
a
proverbial
dance
of
flavors
mixed
with
a
solid
yeast
profile
its
as
if
ommegang
has
been
doing
this
for
hundreds
of
years
its
a
sweet
nectar
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
too
im
drinking
it
in
the
dead
of
winter
but
this
would
be
a
beer
garden
summer
treat
wow
overall
not
the
greatest
saison
in
the
world
but
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
as
is
the
case
with
all
ommegang
beers
this
beer
was
fantastic
but
it
was
a
little
too
clean
for
a
saison
probably
one
of
the
best
americanmade
saisons
though
poured
a
beautiful
hazy
orange
color
with
a
beautiful
off
white
head
scent
is
all
yeasty
bread
and
citrus
with
the
taste
following
closely
to
the
scent
the
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
like
good
champagne
and
tingles
the
tongue
this
is
a
good
saison
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
humph
in
the
overall
taste
but
good
nonetheless
overall
a
very
nice
beer
sour
and
bitter
with
just
the
right
fruit
sweetness
well
done
for
a
brett
fermented
beer
overall
like
this
beer
alot
probably
my
favorite
of
this
style
great
flavor
here
o
a
nice
saison
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
will
be
a
great
goto
when
i
feel
like
something
different
o
one
of
my
favorites
for
enjoying
with
a
meal
not
my
favorite
saison
but
quite
possibly
the
standard
on
which
many
great
saisons
are
based
a
classic
o
this
was
an
interesting
complex
taste
i
havent
drank
too
many
belgian
saison
ales
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
a
top
notch
brew
good
flavor
and
complexity
while
remaining
balanced
could
use
a
little
more
body
though
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
interplay
between
the
crisp
and
cleaning
and
the
earthy
and
the
muddy
the
flavors
are
all
clean
but
blend
nicely
towards
the
finish
for
a
more
robust
and
full
flavoring
collectively
paradoxically
the
flavors
do
muddle
towards
this
end
but
in
a
nice
balanced
way
one
negative
is
that
the
carbonation
is
painfully
too
much
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
as
a
caveat
however
i
will
note
that
the
first
glass
from
the
bottle
wasnt
exciting
but
when
i
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
refilled
my
glass
now
with
the
dregs
and
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
that
my
pour
definitely
had
a
more
vibrant
character
to
it
is
this
something
as
simple
as
a
top
vs
bottom
of
the
bottle
difference
5
for
the
dregs
well
folks
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
i
mean
saisons
can
be
quite
varied
pour
this
pour
jack
dor
pour
dupont
different
strokes
the
body
and
flavor
are
so
clean
but
with
a
deep
dank
nose
lemon
and
hay
funk
of
course
light
golden
raisins
mmmm
not
too
much
spicing
from
the
yeast
no
cloy
fresh
refreshing

gtfo
love
it
o
the
best
farmhouse
saison
i
have
tried
thus
far
perfection
in
the
melding
of
flavor
and
feel
the
light
yeastiness
flowers
and
spice
and
the
perfectly
dry
finish
make
it
top
shelf
champagne
in
the
form
of
beer
o
not
my
favorite
saison
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
a
murky
golden
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
spices
and
belgian
yeast
there
is
also
a
bit
of
an
unknown
fruity
aroma
taste
is
of
grains
spices
fruits
and
some
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
slight
funky
bitterness
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
saison
that
is
very
lively
and
refreshing
overall
a
great
domestic
version
that
could
probably
pass
for
a
true
belgian
farmhouse
ale
i
would
not
hesitiate
making
a
reccomadation
with
this
beer
another
winner
from
brewery
ommegang
wonderful
beer
complex
and
interesting
very
enjoyable
o
a
very
well
done
saison
that
touches
the
right
flavor
points
but
just
isnt
my
absolute
favorite
in
terms
of
the
style
i
would
prefer
just
a
bit
of
a
brighter
flavor
often
found
in
the
more
citrusy
saisons
i
have
encountered
jack
dor
is
what
comes
to
mind
for
example
clear
honey
colored
body
with
a
giant
three
finger
tall
head
the
bright
white
head
slowly
settles
into
a
frothy
cap
leaving
plenty
of
big
clumpy
lacing
behind
smell
is
sweet
and
peppery
belgian
yeast
and
hops
provide
most
of
the
smell
it
has
a
slight
funk
in
the
taste
in
a
good
way
nice
bready
malts
and
pepper
shine
bright
has
a
full
mouthfeel
to
it
with
great
carbonation
creamy
texture
and
a
spicy
finish
make
this
one
of
the
better
saisons
out
there
i
would
not
think
twice
about
recommending
this
to
someone
wanting
to
try
the
style
overall
4
light
flavours
that
are
exceptionally
true
to
the
style
and
pay
homeage
to
their
belgian
roots
a
rolling
thick
head
with
a
spice
flavour
that
lingers
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
distinctive
of
a
belgian
yeast
production
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
is
very
likely
at
the
top
of
its
style
overall
i
have
had
this
plenty
of
times
before
and
it
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
for
this
style
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
and
very
happy
now
that
i
have
enjoyed
another
one
o
overall
an
exceptional
beer
that
i
enjoyed
highly
i
love
this
beer
great
with
spicy
food
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
ommegang
brew
next
to
three
philosophers
note
bought
as
part
of
the
ommegang
christmas
gift
pack
well
worth
it
for
the
price
drinkable
but
not
as
excellent
as
i
had
anticipated
based
on
its
ratings
maybe
im
just
not
big
on
saisons
in
general
because
it
seems
well
constructed
but
i
dont
envision
myself
drinking
another
one
any
time
soon
o
good
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorite
styles
try
this
one
out
overall
this
was
a
solid
saison
and
for
its
availability
and
pricepoint
it
really
shines
the
only
downside
is
that
it
could
do
a
bit
more
to
set
itself
apart
this
belgian
beer
is
everything
that
this
style
is
about
it
is
not
over
sweet
or
over
refined
it
is
perfect
o
excellent
saison
everything
you
could
ask
for
in
this
style
of
beer
o
really
nice
saison
with
a
well
deserved
rep
gotta
say
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
typical
staple
of
ipas
and
imp
stouts
overall
not
a
bad
beer
give
it
a
shot
if
you
are
a
saison
lover
id
wait
for
warmer
weather
however
the
saisons
ive
had
this
winter
have
just
felt
so
out
of
season
cheers
o
very
nice
affordable
too
this
one
misses
the
10
dollar
mark
by
a
hair
overall
saisons
are
always
interesting
to
try
out
from
different
brewers
and
fortunately
ommegang
has
delivered
a
solid
saison
ale
its
flavor
is
nice
and
complex
and
while
the
mouthfeel
leaves
something
else
to
be
desired
its
still
an
excellent
beer
poured
from
bottle
into
dogfish
head
snifter
golden
color
with
huge
thick
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
on
side
of
glass
smells
very
floral
with
some
citrus
notes
and
cinnamon
taste
is
citrus
with
very
mild
bitterness
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
my
first
of
this
style
will
definitely
buy
again
oa
wonderful
saison
one
of
the
best
out
there
overall
considering
this
is
a
beer
brewed
out
of
pure
passion
versus
hundreds
of
years
worth
of
experience
it
is
damn
impressive
rich
in
color
and
taste
this
is
a
beer
to
be
revered
its
no
wonder
duvel
moortgat
bought
this
out
this
is
beautifully
layered
and
yet
represents
the
style
almost
perfectly
a
great
farmhouse
sasion
poured
from
355ml
bottle
i
ended
up
with
a
foamy
head
due
probably
to
my
over
vigourous
pouring
technique
once
it
settled
the
beer
is
pale
and
cloudy
in
appearance
due
to
the
yeast
sediment
a
hoppy
crisp
taste
pleasant
to
drink
the
beer
belies
its
7
7
abv
overall
a
very
good
saison
worth
checking
out
goes
down
very
smoothly
carbonation
is
a
shade
high
but
the
flavors
meld
together
masterfully
o
a
good
beer
i
am
not
really
familiar
with
belgian
styles
but
i
like
it
o
this
was
like
a
strong
pale
belgian
not
as
sweet
and
creamy
as
their
gnomegang
nor
as
cleanfinishing
and
strong
as
a
duvel
a
goodtasting
beer
easily
quaffable
might
be
one
of
the
few
beers
i
preferred
while
it
was
a
little
colder
it
had
a
brisk
character
that
compelled
me
to
take
real
hearty
swigs
as
opposed
to
say
thoughtful
sips
would
definitely
recommend
m
i
love
how
it
sits
on
my
tongue
smooth
but
with
an
occasional
bite
an
absolute
favorite
for
me
and
the
default
pale
on
my
shelf
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
the
best
saisonfarmy
beer
ive
had
totally
lives
up
to
the
good
rating
here
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
one
of
my
favs
always
a
great
choice
perfect
balance
of
belgian
yeast
hops
and
carbonation
even
better
on
tap
im
my
opinion
but
this
review
was
from
a
bottle
which
offers
the
bottle
conditioned
aspect
amazing
edit
i
need
to
add
that
this
review
was
from
a
bottle
that
was
bottled
in
october
of
2009
overall
an
excellent
beer
from
appearance
to
taste
and
presence
overall
an
excellent
saison
very
sessionable
easy
drinking
father
hennepin
would
be
proud
of
his
namesake
i
must
have
more
this
has
really
turned
me
on
to
the
taste
of
saisons
o
pretty
nice
my
first
saison
im
quite
surprised
how
similar
it
is
to
a
belgian
golden
ale
but
this
is
quite
tasty
drink
this
was
pretty
good
and
flavorful
more
of
a
sipping
saison
with
big
bold
flavors
and
a
good
balance
and
feel
i
like
what
ommegang
does
ill
come
back
to
their
beers
for
sure
poured
from
a
brown
25
4
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
alive
with
fruits
yeast
some
sweetness
taste
is
very
good
fruits
yeast
mild
hops
a
touch
of
alcohol
just
a
bit
sweet
very
complex
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
beer
i
give
it
a
good
grade
for
being
outstanding
on
all
levels
d
i
could
drink
this
saison
all
the
time
and
with
ommegangs
great
beers
being
so
low
priced
its
a
possibility
ive
enjoyed
many
bottles
of
hennepin
in
the
past
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
ive
detected
overwhelming
sweetness
in
this
beer
pleasant
enough
but
far
from
the
best
the
style
has
to
offer
overall
its
a
great
beer
a
little
less
lingering
bitterness
and
more
lingering
flavor
would
make
even
better
though
still
for
a
saison
thats
relatively
easy
to
find
in
single
serving
bottles
its
hard
to
beat
light
bodied
with
generally
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
excellent
and
very
drinkable
a
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
ill
drink
it
many
more
times
to
come
im
sure
this
is
a
solid
and
clean
beer
do
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
funk
sure
however
the
hopping
and
dry
mouthfeel
are
so
in
line
with
where
i
want
them
to
be
that
i
dont
mind
the
lack
of
huge
farmhouse
character
o
flavorful
and
balanced
has
some
malt
character
o
big
big
flavors
love
the
finish
this
is
an
interesting
complex
beer
i
liked
this
much
more
than
i
anticipated
o
a
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
but
a
beer
that
can
does
not
scream
for
attention
i
cant
believe
im
just
now
having
this
for
the
first
time
ive
been
missing
out
great
great
beer
here
ill
be
trying
all
of
ommegangs
beer
in
short
time
carbonation
is
quite
noticeable
at
first
but
dies
down
fairly
soon
a
very
nice
saison
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
this
is
a
very
good
saison
not
as
dry
as
many
others
the
feel
is
silky
and
very
sharp
and
the
light
but
robust
body
just
coats
the
mouth
with
loveliness
the
slightly
dry
finish
keeps
me
sipping
at
an
alarming
rate
ommegang
definitely
has
a
stronghold
on
the
saison
market
with
this
classy
and
well
crafted
brew
o
the
standard
of
american
brewed
saisons
in
my
opinion
it
has
earned
and
continues
to
deserve
the
title
overall
a
great
saison
remarkable
that
it
comes
from
ny
because
this
one
tastes
belgian
all
the
way
really
enjoyable
if
i
could
get
this
locally
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
it
overall
the
hop
flavoring
in
this
one
is
different
the
aroma
is
excellent
this
does
a
great
service
to
the
style
a
very
approachable
and
enjoyable
interpretation
and
worthy
of
its
reputation
glad
its
available
locally
now
this
will
be
a
regular
goto
of
the
style
for
me
o
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
saison
solid
all
around
no
5s
on
the
scorecard
but
nothing
missing
either
exceptional
americanmade
version
of
a
belgian
style
one
of
my
favorites
and
a
staple
to
keep
on
hand
given
the
availability
and
price
point
overhopped
especially
for
a
saison
i
dont
pick
up
the
hop
character
in
the
smell
but
its
quite
obvious
in
the
taste
and
its
effects
are
largely
negative
thats
really
too
bad
as
whats
there
underneath
that
bitterness
is
quite
solid
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
nice
taste
and
smell
intense
head
that
lasts
forever
didnt
like
the
mouthfeel
as
much
as
i
liked
the
rest
o
another
stellar
choice
from
ommegang
after
trying
a
bieredemars
i
didnt
think
i
would
ever
like
anything
this
dry
and
earthy
but
this
is
so
complex
yet
balanced
very
drinkable
i
went
through
the
750
ml
bottle
way
too
fast
cheers
o
this
has
good
drinkability
would
have
no
problem
having
a
few
glasses
of
this
in
an
evening
since
i
just
did
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
saison
i
just
wish
that
it
has
a
bit
more
funk
to
it
i
think
it
is
definitely
an
easily
approachable
example
of
the
style
i
would
buy
again
a
well
made
um
american
saison
heritage
and
corporate
buyouts
aside
this
is
just
plain
enjoyable
the
delicate
nature
of
the
farmhouse
ale
decently
ramped
up
balanced
and
quite
agreeable
as
the
masked
booze
strength
plays
up
well
to
the
waning
summer
ethos
up
here
in
the
soon
to
be
great
white
north
this
is
very
good
but
not
as
open
on
the
nose
as
one
would
like
has
a
funkier
side
to
it
but
doesnt
go
the
full
way
its
a
good
saison
that
aims
more
rustic
than
citrusy
d
fantastic
saison
it
has
high
drinkability
and
is
a
relaxing
balanced
brew
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
but
is
very
warming
there
is
a
champagnelike
vibe
going
on
which
improves
the
overall
experience
o
this
is
a
nice
saison
that
is
easy
to
drink
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
would
like
it
more
if
the
aroma
and
taste
where
bigger
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
and
refreshing
a
nice
saison
overall
impression
a
very
fruity
saison
easy
to
drink
has
mild
spice
and
sourness
but
not
every
brew
this
style
can
have
these
distinctive
aromasflavors
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
one
but
not
bad
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
but
enjoyed
thebeeralmanac
com
o
extremely
drinkable
and
definitely
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
again
overall
i
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
i
think
next
time
it
wont
be
a
fiveyear
gap
before
my
next
drink
if
you
want
to
start
experimenting
with
saison
then
i
dont
think
you
can
go
wrong
with
trying
this
one
first
a
funky
and
unique
beer
not
my
favorite
but
i
can
definitely
see
the
sense
and
sensibility
in
its
novelty
and
respectfully
so
overall
kickass
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
not
to
try
this
one
will
buy
again
and
again
and
again
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
that
i
can
think
of
for
sure
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
the
beer
is
a
reddish
amber
with
a
cottony
white
head
that
sticks
around
leaving
fine
lace
the
smell
is
a
little
herbal
from
the
hops
spicy
from
the
yeast
and
bready
from
the
malt
the
beer
tasted
good
but
it
was
definitely
undercarbonated
which
keeps
the
aromas
in
the
beer
and
out
of
my
nose
but
it
kind
of
also
ruins
full
appreciation
of
the
beer
this
was
carbonated
more
like
an
english
pale
than
a
farmhouse
ale
the
beer
wasnt
as
fiesty
and
zippy
as
the
bottled
versions
of
this
beer
which
are
perfectly
carbed
that
said
i
think
this
beer
develops
in
the
bottle
a
bit
and
it
might
be
the
microoxidiation
along
with
carabonation
from
the
bottling
process
that
adds
some
earthy
and
fruity
flavors
i
remembered
in
this
beer
that
was
not
present
taste
is
clean
and
bright
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
yeast
malt
and
hops
work
in
perfect
harmony
here
confirmed
once
again
as
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
not
as
great
as
say
most
saisons
actually
from
belgium
but
overall
still
quite
good
pale
straw
gold
fairly
clear
with
a
careful
pour
however
the
head
is
crazy
even
with
a
slow
pour
i
get
half
a
glass
of
foam
and
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
going
anywhere
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
with
this
one
it
is
dominated
by
yeasty
esters
like
bananas
and
cloves
but
there
are
also
lemon
and
peppery
spice
as
well
the
taste
is
classic
saison
fruit
spice
and
clean
crisp
grain
for
the
fruit
i
notice
lemon
and
other
citrus
the
spice
is
mainly
light
pepper
and
a
bit
of
clove
and
that
is
all
rounded
out
by
nice
pale
malts
the
mouthfeel
too
is
good
lively
carbonation
with
a
super
dry
and
clean
finish
that
manages
to
leave
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
invites
the
next
sip
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
does
sneak
up
near
the
end
of
the
glass
overall
a
very
good
example
of
an
often
under
respected
style
o
cant
believe
ive
never
even
tried
this
before
what
a
treat
available
year
round
and
reasonably
priced
this
one
is
going
straight
onto
my
goto
list
definitely
recommended
o
smooth
drinking
saison
with
some
nice
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
and
chalky
overall
this
seems
ok
to
me
maybe
i
didnt
get
the
best
bottle
it
was
on
clearance
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
apparent
and
does
not
cause
the
beer
to
fizzle
when
held
in
your
mouth
but
it
is
just
strong
enough
to
help
push
this
beer
along
the
body
is
not
coating
and
sticky
nor
light
watery
but
sippable
and
gulpable
a
great
saison
sweeter
than
some
and
without
a
strong
muskyfarmyard
flavor
but
still
lively
and
bright
and
with
lovely
citrus
and
peppery
notes
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
was
very
refreshing
and
affordable
i
would
easily
imagine
myself
getting
this
beer
again
o
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
there
are
four
others
that
i
would
choose
in
front
of
this
one
just
ok
dgreat
session
beer
especially
for
the
summer
months
smell
is
fantastic
spice
grains
fruit
pepper
really
well
balanced
and
really
excellent
for
the
style
taste
is
amazing
for
the
style
same
profile
as
the
nose
it
amazes
me
that
a
beer
this
refreshing
and
balanced
can
pack
a
7
5
abv
wallop
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
and
balanced
not
much
more
you
could
ask
for
here
overall
this
is
probably
the
second
best
saison
ive
had
and
the
best
from
the
usa
its
priced
really
well
and
i
cant
recommend
this
one
enough
if
youre
looking
for
a
saison
o
it
really
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
in
its
style
or
any
other
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
always
have
been
light
refreshing
fruity
tart
bready
spicy
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
brewed
only
about
an
hour
and
a
half
away
from
me
and
not
half
a
world
away
take
a
bow
ommegang
you
deserve
it
an
excellent
brew
i
had
thought
that
perhaps
this
would
be
more
suited
for
a
cooler
month
but
this
seems
lighter
and
more
summery
than
some
saissons
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
saison
enjoyable
stuff
best
saison
ive
tasted
this
year
highly
drinkable
but
with
a
rich
set
of
flavors
shows
a
good
saison
doesnt
need
the
excess
of
acidity
and
random
bacteria
so
often
encountered
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
good
really
good
but
i
dont
know
that
its
quite
as
good
as
laverys
liopard
oir
dont
mean
to
be
a
homer
but
thats
just
my
opinion
o
good
refreshing
beer
that
might
even
be
sessionable
if
it
werent
for
two
things
1
the
alcy
in
this
is
higher
than
youd
think
and
2
the
carbonation
makes
you
feel
bloated
o
a
great
example
of
a
refreshing
crisp
saison
that
works
amazingly
as
a
summer
beer
it
can
even
be
aged
for
a
few
years
which
i
think
would
be
interesting
to
try
interesting
flavors
the
toastiness
adds
some
uniqueness
but
i
wish
it
had
just
a
tad
more
hoppiness
to
it
to
make
it
more
distinguishable
from
a
hefe
especially
when
sediment
is
added
in
o
pretty
standard
example
of
a
saison
good
but
not
great
i
like
this
better
from
a
bomber
o
really
quite
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
appreciated
all
the
flavors
in
here
but
there
isnt
too
much
complexity
in
here
id
say
the
flavors
are
even
fairly
homogenized
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
this
a
very
clean
representation
of
the
style
and
it
most
certainly
should
be
had
with
food
stir
fry
steamed
greens
and
light
salads
would
do
awesome
here
you
wouldnt
even
need
to
put
pepper
on
your
salad
its
already
in
your
glass
sour
out
a
really
fantastic
saison
this
might
be
the
classic
benchmark
standard
for
the
styleand
i
wouldnt
argue
the
point
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
feel
very
easy
drinking
with
a
low
alcohol
impact
despite
the
conflict
of
listed
abv
on
the
label
regardless
if
it
is
7
5
or
8
5
abv
it
drinks
like
it
is
half
of
that
exceptionally
balanced
this
brew
has
gone
through
quite
a
transformation
i
actually
enjoy
it
more
with
age
on
it
than
a
fresh
offering
nice
mouthfeel
is
full
but
the
beer
is
exceptionally
dry
after
the
swallow
it
just
vanishes
off
the
tounge
and
youre
ready
for
the
next
sip
perfect
on
a
hot
day
like
today
very
refreshing
overall
i
cant
think
of
a
better
example
of
the
style
its
like
reading
the
style
guidelines
for
a
saison
word
for
word
if
i
was
stuck
on
an
island
and
could
only
choose
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
might
be
this
one
the
yeast
flavors
dont
really
hit
saison
head
on
for
me
and
i
think
they
might
dry
it
out
with
the
sugar
rather
then
a
traditional
saison
yeast
but
it
just
all
works
so
damn
good
together
certainly
this
is
not
bad
but
im
evidently
not
part
of
the
adoring
crowd
this
beer
has
frankly
i
gotta
be
honest
compared
to
the
best
of
the
worst
of
the
macrobrews
stuff
like
leinies
rolling
rock
i
cannot
say
that
hennepin
is
better
than
those
beers
by
an
order
of
magnitude
this
is
just
a
really
solid
local
beer
for
me
brewed
in
the
same
casks
they
used
to
brew
duvel
in
as
they
were
shipped
over
to
ny
from
belgium
some
people
get
turned
off
from
this
beer
do
to
the
very
floral
smell
and
taste
and
high
alchohol
side
note
this
beer
makes
me
sleepy
if
i
drink
it
early
on
in
the
day
hennepin
goes
for
the
win
and
hennewins
d
this
is
a
good
saison
there
is
some
nice
complexity
but
i
would
like
it
if
the
hops
were
a
touch
more
subdued
and
the
yeast
flavors
higher
prost
pours
a
bright
clean
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
fist
of
head
that
settles
to
a
steady
1
finger
reach
smells
of
big
citrus
lemons
orange
peels
grapes
bananas
with
the
familiar
belgian
yeast
flavors
loaded
with
lots
of
spice
characters
pale
banana
and
citrus
malt
fill
the
tongue
nice
mild
cloves
and
ginger
spices
float
around
light
on
the
body
medium
carbonation
leaves
the
mouth
slightly
bitter
with
a
nice
zesty
dry
feeling
that
begs
for
another
delicious
sip
this
is
a
wonderful
saison
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
the
year
everything
works
on
this
beer
total
home
run
cheers
this
pours
a
yeast
hazy
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
which
ends
up
being
about
a
finger
in
width
and
leaves
a
slight
lacing
the
smell
is
of
belgium
yeast
esters
a
little
clove
and
citrus
the
mouth
feel
is
light
to
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
complicated
its
yeasty
sweet
at
first
citrus
lemon
and
then
it
ends
with
a
nice
slight
hoppy
spicy
peppery
dry
finish
very
refreshing
this
is
actually
my
first
saison
and
i
love
it
this
is
much
more
of
a
good
summer
drink
for
my
tastes
than
the
sa
brooklyn
summer
ales
good
stuff
o
this
saison
was
pretty
good
although
too
much
spice
and
pepper
and
no
detectable
funk
made
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
i
enjoyed
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
a
very
delicious
brew
not
as
interesting
as
i
had
hoped
by
that
i
mean
i
wished
perhaps
for
more
spice
and
funk
but
it
does
show
consistency
with
my
other
ommegang
experiences
delicious
and
approachable
belgianstyle
brews
with
an
unbeatable
pricepoint
being
domestic
and
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
easy
drinking
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
like
the
style
and
this
is
a
great
example
will
definitely
have
again
highly
recommended
m
light
and
very
carbonated
o
a
very
nice
saison
big
on
the
yeast
and
solid
on
the
citrus
overallgood
beer
not
outstanding
a
little
too
sweet
on
the
finish
to
drink
that
much
at
once
could
use
a
little
more
hops
still
a
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
an
awesome
summer
quencher
it
proved
to
me
there
are
good
domestic
examples
as
well
doverall
this
was
a
nice
saison
had
nice
earthy
yeasty
flavor
as
long
as
good
citrus
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
i
dont
no
how
much
i
will
seek
this
out
again
but
wont
ever
turn
down
having
a
glass
of
this
one
d
its
as
good
as
sunshine
the
overall
balance
of
the
brew
is
dialed
in
to
perfection
definitely
did
not
disappoint
ommegang
d
exceptionally
crafted
quite
possibly
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
consumed
highly
recommended
is
it
my
favorite
style
no
is
it
good
hell
yeah
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
yeasty
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
white
bubbly
head
that
doesnt
retain
terribly
long
or
lace
much
the
aroma
is
somewhat
weak
with
the
usual
banana
and
spice
notes
as
well
some
earthy
and
floral
hops
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
banana
and
moves
to
some
spicy
notes
and
finishes
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
well
balanced
and
finishes
clean
overall
a
great
saison
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
nice
looking
hazy
golden
yellow
the
head
billows
and
needs
to
be
given
a
moment
to
settle
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
funk
to
it
but
its
not
as
much
as
some
of
the
authentic
farmhouse
ales
out
there
the
taste
has
a
pretty
good
amount
of
malts
and
yeast
with
some
spices
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
has
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
it
alive
on
the
tongue
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
really
overall
great
representative
of
the
style
o
ommegangs
hennepin
is
the
quintessential
americanmade
saison
its
great
summertime
drinking
and
is
balanced
enough
to
put
back
yearround
worthy
of
most
hype
and
worth
seeking
out
this
is
most
likely
the
best
saison
ive
had
to
date
smooth
flavourful
and
extremely
refreshing
this
stuff
would
be
positively
dangerous
outside
on
a
sunny
day
at
7
7
abv
this
bottle
disappeared
too
bad
there
was
only
one
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
finishes
very
crisply
very
drinkable
light
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
yet
would
be
flavorful
enough
to
combine
with
a
meal
mouthfeel
light
bodied
and
extremely
well
carbonated
it
goes
down
easy
i
could
imagine
coming
in
from
a
hot
day
of
working
out
in
the
yard
and
being
perfectly
refreshed
by
this
saison
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
and
tons
of
carbonation
continuing
to
make
its
way
up
the
glass
the
smell
is
floral
with
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
is
a
little
spicy
with
some
fruit
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
light
with
high
carbonation
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
overal
this
beer
is
a
solid
a
pale
yellow
transparent
a
couple
of
fingers
of
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
citrus
and
some
yeasty
smell
the
taste
to
me
has
a
tart
sour
apple
flavor
followed
by
a
peppery
spice
that
adds
to
its
complexity
i
didnt
expect
this
complexity
when
i
first
saw
it
poured
it
finishes
a
little
dry
and
has
a
nice
and
light
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
perfect
brew
for
this
95
degree
day
overall
im
really
digging
this
saison
style
so
far
to
me
this
is
the
benchmark
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
summer
beer
get
one
asap
o
such
a
light
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
that
the
high
alcohol
content
doesnt
come
through
until
the
last
third
of
the
glass
perfect
for
a
102
degree
mn
day
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
overall
this
is
my
first
saison
and
i
will
say
it
sets
a
good
standard
for
what
i
will
expect
pushing
forward
d
good
drink
great
summer
beer
nice
beer
for
food
pairings
could
be
a
bit
filling
after
a
few
overall
an
exemplary
saison
and
an
enjoyable
drink
for
a
hot
day
a
truly
delicious
and
assertive
saison
putting
others
to
shame
note
i
just
found
a
750ml
bottle
of
hennepin
that
was
brewed
by
ommegangs
parent
company
duvel
in
belgium
and
was
going
to
rereview
this
no
need
these
notes
still
capture
it
amazing
that
this
can
be
brewed
in
two
distinctly
different
locations
with
the
same
results
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
slightly
better
from
the
bigger
bottles
but
it
is
close
enough
where
i
wouldnt
oppose
the
12oz
ones
d
after
a
bit
you
do
notice
that
this
is
a
fairly
strong
version
still
it
is
easy
drinking
enough
just
too
strong
to
be
a
quaffer
best
had
with
food
the
lemon
tartness
would
cut
flavors
well
and
cleans
the
palate
rustic
and
hearty
a
nice
and
fresh
saison
very
nice
with
cheese
and
sausages
o
overall
a
good
american
saison
nicely
attenuated
so
its
not
too
sweet
with
a
good
mix
of
spice
and
light
fruit
flavors
overall
this
is
a
terrific
and
well
balanced
saison
ale
and
well
worth
trying
perfect
beer
for
someone
looking
for
a
kicked
up
belgian
style
wheat
ale
in
the
summer
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
ever
had
and
thats
saying
a
lot
considering
its
brewed
in
ny
the
fact
that
this
is
available
year
around
means
trouble
for
my
wallet
as
im
sure
ill
be
buying
tons
of
it
in
the
next
few
months
cant
recommend
it
enough
overall
im
a
little
confused
with
this
beer
it
takes
like
a
blonde
bock
to
me
flavor
notes
along
with
the
smell
are
pretty
flat
its
not
bad
and
is
a
decent
spring
type
beer
but
im
just
so
confused
with
what
its
trying
to
achieve
cuz
its
just
so
simple
it
kind
of
tastes
like
its
a
homebrewers
first
attempt
at
the
style
o
this
is
a
really
nice
saisonfarmhouse
ale
light
crisp
and
refreshing
not
overly
musty
d
highly
drinkable
as
i
do
like
the
style
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retains
and
laces
well
yeasty
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
grass
and
light
spice
biscuity
taste
with
flavors
of
orange
zest
apple
banana
grassy
with
notes
of
spice
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
easily
drinkable
wow
what
a
nice
suprise
packet
this
ended
up
being
from
knowing
nothing
about
it
to
being
in
love
with
it
and
it
pours
a
very
pale
straw
hue
almost
like
a
fine
crystal
champagne
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
and
a
half
finger
head
with
heaps
of
lacingthe
smell
is
very
spicy
with
hints
of
white
peppercorrianderlime
and
citrusy
hopsand
the
taste
is
just
as
good
as
it
looks
which
starts
off
with
spicey
citrus
zestfunky
tart
white
fruita
tinge
of
boiled
candy
and
finished
off
with
a
nice
spiceyhop
dry
finish
which
leaves
your
palette
wanting
more
of
it
and
overall
for
me
a
truly
unique
tasty
drop
that
will
buy
more
of
before
its
goneimpressive
even
with
a
750ml
bottle
i
found
myself
smelling
an
empty
glass
before
this
review
was
typed
this
one
went
down
very
fast
and
every
sip
left
me
wanting
more
and
before
i
knew
it
there
was
no
more
to
be
had
big
thanks
to
liamt07
for
sending
me
this
beautyits
not
every
day
i
throw
down
an
a
and
this
one
deserves
it
very
drinkable
beer
had
this
on
my
balcony
on
a
nice
summer
night
in
florida
and
it
hit
the
spot
juuust
right
light
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
one
of
the
best
widely
available
saisons
around
nice
balance
of
funk
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
o
well
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
i
have
tried
and
i
have
tried
many
true
to
type
did
i
mention
that
this
beer
is
just
spot
on
delicious
o
maybe
not
the
best
saison
ive
had
but
certainly
belongs
in
the
conversation
in
fact
id
say
this
is
the
best
of
style
available
in
nashville
for
what
its
worth
pours
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
on
this
one
is
the
best
ive
seen
on
a
saisonfarmhouse
thick
creamy
3
finger
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spot
on
ripe
fruit
comes
to
mind
first
kiwi
bannana
green
apple
and
peach
you
also
get
some
nice
breaddough
flavors
in
there
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
almost
exactly
i
love
the
fruit
you
get
with
this
beer
there
is
a
slight
funk
that
is
going
on
too
musty
like
flavors
on
the
finish
overall
i
loved
this
beer
right
up
there
with
my
favorite
saisons
overall
this
is
an
excellent
summer
time
brew
thay
can
become
dangerously
drinkable
the
comination
of
flavors
is
balanced
nicely
and
rubs
me
the
right
way
o
quite
drinkable
in
spite
of
the
sweetness
and
prominent
booze
o
a
delicious
saison
and
very
drinkable
it
pairs
nicely
with
a
grilled
hamburger
d
the
alcohol
definitely
is
evident
on
this
one
not
so
much
in
the
taste
but
more
on
the
brain
at
7
7
this
isnt
a
shocker
overall
a
great
drinker
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
well
done
im
new
to
saisons
but
i
know
each
saison
can
and
imo
should
have
its
own
unique
characteristics
this
one
seems
to
be
simple
subtle
unobtrusive
oi
found
that
the
belgian
spiciness
makes
this
not
very
drinkable
i
like
it
in
other
belgians
but
in
this
the
taste
gets
tiring
this
is
pretty
much
an
average
saison
that
i
dont
feel
is
great
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
people
more
accustomed
to
the
style
but
thats
just
me
12oz
bottle
pours
somewhat
hazy
light
yellow
with
massive
chunky
white
head
carbonation
is
quite
active
aroma
has
hay
grass
wheat
and
lemon
taste
is
sweet
malt
but
the
hop
bitterness
is
more
pronounced
its
a
bit
spicy
as
well
light
to
medium
bodied
witha
slick
texture
finish
is
dry
and
reminiscent
of
lemon
peel
this
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
a
well
hidden
abv
a
good
beer
overall
a
very
good
version
of
a
belgian
saison
overall
what
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
awhile
so
complete
and
so
well
balanced
d
cant
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
which
is
great
for
the
7
7
abv
it
would
be
easy
to
sip
on
a
cold
bottle
of
this
for
hours
o
a
nice
farmhouse
ale
belgian
yeast
plays
a
large
role
and
it
is
drinkable
dry
and
clean
i
hate
reviewing
this
style
as
they
all
seem
to
take
on
such
different
characteristics
there
is
always
a
hopsour
effect
but
after
that
it
seems
like
everything
is
fair
game
as
a
result
all
i
can
say
is
this
one
of
the
best
ive
had
with
the
style
but
i
believe
the
results
can
still
be
far
better
o
really
really
good
saison
here
so
easy
to
find
and
reasonably
priced
really
my
goto
saison
great
beer
i
can
see
why
this
is
an
a
served
around
54f
overall
wow
freakin
delicious
i
have
no
idea
where
the
7
7
abv
is
and
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
these
aroma
is
inviting
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
me
want
to
drink
more
and
more
this
is
a
very
sexy
beer
that
everyone
should
drink
if
you
dont
like
this
you
dont
like

complimenting
the
light

with

dry
and
bitter

of
banana
and
clove
appear
and
bring
subtle
booze
along
as
an
aftertaste
medium

with
zappy

and
a
slight
cloying
of
flavor
a
great
belgianstyle
saison
with
refreshing
flavor
and
well
executed
booze
and
mouthfeel
d
solid
pickup
worth
a
purchase
and
a
repeat
i
would
gladly
set
this
in
front
of
me
on
a
nice
warm
day
not
very
experienced
in
saisons
but
found
this
to
be
a
tasty
wellcrafted
brew
particularly
enjoyed
the
aroma
the
corked
bottle
opened
with
a
wonderful
pop
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
poured
a
gorgeous
hazy
straw
yellow
that
prevented
you
from
seeing
through
the
glass
the
aroma
was
less
complex
than
i
expected
and
was
yeasty
and
floral
the
beer
was
notably
carbonated
and
bubbles
played
on
my
tongue
with
every
sip
however
the
flavor
did
not
have
much
depth
and
the
only
aftertaste
was
about
a
second
of
sour
on
the
very
tip
of
my
tongue
the
brew
was
enjoyable
but
will
not
be
placed
on
the
top
of
my
list
pours
a
glorious
strawyellow
big
gravitydefying
white
head
at
first
then
settles
down
and
washes
the
glass
splendidly
many
tiny
protein
particles
at
the
last
pour
smells
great
too
clove
citrusy
herbs
and
spices
floral
notes
tastes
great
too
a
bit
of
mineral
on
top
of
the
aforementioned
lemongrass
mildly
hopped
bitter
finish
heavy
for
such
a
litelooking
brew
alcohol
is
a
tad
warming
great
brew
here
a
classic
indeed
i
havent
had
all
that
many
saisons
but
this
one
explains
why
theyre
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
smooth
crisp
refreshing
and
tasty
perfect
for
nearly
any
occasion
id
definitely
buy
this
againa
and
cant
wait
for
my
next
ommegang
brew
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
to
me
is
the
best
of
the
must
tries
that
ive
tried
hennepin
has
continued
my
interest
in
the
style
and
shows
how
the
beauty
of
saison
is
in
simplicity
with
so
many
variations
overall
this
is
quite
tasty
but
this
doesnt
feel
like
a
saison
at
all
most
saisons
i
find
real
polarizing
and
this
is
more
into
simpler
belgian
pale
ale
territory
with
sweetness
i
do
admit
though
i
like
it
i
would
tell
people
to
start
here
for
this
style
before
grabbing
something
like
a
dupont
or
god
forbid
a
fantome
for
a
first
time
saison
drinker
very
bland
and
boring
for
me
and
just
does
not
taste
very
good
this
beer
pours
very
nicely
into
a
glass
it
has
a
yellow
murky
look
to
it
there
is
not
a
lot
of
smell
to
the
beer
but
what
it
lacks
in
smell
it
makes
up
in
taste
there
is
a
slight
sour
taste
with
some
citrus
hops
added
in
there
is
a
decent
after
taste
of
thirst
quenching
juice
like
flavor
great
as
a
hot
summer
day
beer
cheers
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
beer
pours
relatively
clear
with
some
minor
yeast
particles
present
though
thats
not
unusal
for
the
style
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
big
head
top
the
beer
aroma
is
tart
and
fruity
with
damp
straw
underneath
taste
is
honey
sweet
almost
surprisingly
so
followed
by
a
refreshing
lemon
dryness
crisp
light
cracker
malt
can
be
found
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
with
a
light
peppery
phonolic
finish
thats
dry
and
leaves
you
wanting
to
drink
more
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
somewhat
sticky
kind
of
like
a
sticky
soda
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
better
than
i
was
anticipating
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
energetic
overall
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
although
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
to
be
sessionable
recommended
ive
also
had
this
out
of
the
750ml
corked
bottle
and
this
might
be
sacrilege
but
i
enjoyed
it
slightly
more
this
way
it
was
sharper
or
perhaps
that
particular
750ml
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
little
long
i
dont
think
this
beer
should
really
be
aged
too
much
its
a
little
low
on
the
abv
and
heavy
on
the
hops
for
that
o
big
flavors
that
i
found
very
drinkable
i
would
prefer
to
drink
this
on
a
hot
humid
day
this
really
blew
me
away
especially
since
the
style
is
usually
too
overspiced
for
me
o
i
was
slightly
let
down
by
this
one
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
was
a
bad
brew
infact
it
was
very
good
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
complexity
and
a
little
more
originality
but
still
good
and
worth
the
try
skal
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
banana
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
thiswas
a
pretty
decent
and
easy
drinking
brew
it
was
not
overly
complex
but
still
pretty
nice
for
the
style
i
had
this
one
a
long
time
back
and
the
spices
just
overwhelmed
me
really
glad
i
revisited
this
one
if
it
were
more
complex
this
one
would
definitely
be
great
definitely
worth
trying
without
a
doubt
very
nice
beer
went
well
with
the
sushi
d
fantastic
overall
saison
well
balanced
between
the
uniqueness
of
a
saison
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
fruity
esters
while
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
it
takes
effect
pretty
quickly
i
would
definitely
get
this
beer
again
o
i
am
pretty
disappointed
by
this
one
it
just
played
it
too
safe
with
the
funk
maybe
the
bottle
was
a
bit
older
and
the
flavors
settled
a
little
overall
this
is
one
my
favorite
year
round
brews
i
mainly
drink
this
in
the
spring
and
summer
though
a
great
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
say
what
a
wonderful
beer
cheers
d
a
beer
you
can
drink
forever
if
you
enjoy
a
belgianstyle
beer
beats
blue
moon
out
of
orbit
for
your
pseudocraft
bm
drinking
friends
grilled
or
steamed
fish
fried

might
disguise
the
enjoyment
poultry

popcorn
most
anything
nonred
or
dark
aside
from
the
tartdry
tongue
that
might
put
some
people
off
its
superb
answer
keep
it
flowing
so
you
dont
have
time
to
have
a
dry
tart
mouth
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
savor
and
my
wife
and
i
will
probably
split
another
one
in
the
near
future
i
am
just
really
looking
forward
to
how
this
ba
recipe
with
hennepin
is
going
to
turn
out
i
will
post
a
review
of
it
later
o
a
beer
that
truly
stands
up
to
its
belgian
friends
and
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
american
copies
of
the
genre
d
very
complex
flavors
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
overall
i
was
not
blown
away
but
did
enjoy
the
beer
and
style
must
revisit
in
the
future
ommegang
hennepin
has
a
slightlycloudy
yellow
colour
and
a
big
4
cm
head
that
fades
to
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
grains
musty
yeast
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
grainy
and
a
little
fruity
apples
the
aftertaste
is
buttery
bitter
and
crisp
im
not
used
to
tasting
saisons
so
its
a
little
new
and
strange
to
me
this
beer
is
foamy
and
strange
but
very
nice
beautiful
pour
into
sniffer
glass
3
fingers
of
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
great
belgian
yeast
honey
suckle
sweet
bready
malts
alcohol
esters
taste
is
solid
with
a
very
dry
crisp
finish
champagne
like
overall
a
good
brew
but
for
some
reason
i
cant
finish
more
than
one
ive
had
a
few
saisons
and
prefer
stillwater
o
very
nice
crisp
clean
smell
and
taste
with
depth
and
balance
ill
surely
buy
this
again
very
good
overall
hennepin
is
a
great
beer
and
goes
fantastic
with
a
meal
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
manages
to
be
refreshing
while
still
being
pretty
robust
in
flavor
a
good
one
to
sip
in
the
summer
and
the
most
affordable
saison
anywhere
around
here
as
it
comes
in
4packs
no
complaints
about
drinkability
this
goes
down
easy
but
the
taste
is
less
than
totally
impressive
so
it
doesnt
compel
me
to
drink
another
one
or
two
good
enough
that
i
would
probably
buy
another
one
for
a
tasting
party
or
a
nice
meal
though
d
a
very
easy
drink
alcohol
is
not
felt
all
in
all
i
was
suprised
by
the
quality
of
an
american
take
on
this
belgian
style
its
no
fantome
but
its
a
quality
saison
its
not
bad
reminiscent
of
other
belgianstyle
ales
i
would
not
call
it
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
but
it
certainly
isnt
bad
ill
probably
have
it
again
in
the
future
the
reveal
ommegang
hennepin
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
im
now
realizing
ive
been
neglecting
it
for
a
readily
available
saison
its
very
good
and
doesnt
kill
your
wallet
for
drinkability
simply
see
the
above
this
is
a
beer
that
should
truly
be
enjoyed
by
everyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
it
body
is
a
bit
heavier
than
i
expected
for
the
style
but
not
overly
heavy
by
any
stretch
still
a
light
and
lively
saison
so
tasty
and
crisp
i
wish
i
picked
up
more
than
four
of
these
will
have
to
make
another
trip
to
ny
again
soon
overall
saison
beers
might
be
my
second
favorite
type
they
frequently
have
pleasant
complexion
without
being
very
heavy
ommegang
delivers
with
hennepin
ale
it
has
great
flavor
nice
body
and
would
be
a
perfect
addition
to
a
warm
day
or
a
setting
sun
poured
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
huge
pure
white
frothy
head
that
was
fully
lasting
and
had
extremely
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
heavy
of
an
earthy
yeast
and
a
moderate
odor
of
straw
malts
and
a
citrus
hops
with
notes
of
banana
and
some
spicesclove
i
think
it
tasted
mildly
sweet
and
yeasty
with
a
slight
acidic
tinge
at
first
and
ended
with
mildly
bitter
yeast
flavor
and
had
hints
of
citrus
and
other
spices
with
the
flavor
lingering
on
the
palate
for
a
nice
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
watery
yet
dry
and
quite
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
an
exceelent
representation
of
the
style
and
a
brew
most
definitely
worth
drinking
again
taste
medium
intensity
with
a
sweet
finish
carbonation
remained
consistent
throughout
drinking
it
ended
with
a
drying
mouth
feel
d
this
was
a
solid
saison
sour
and
bitter
with
a
little
sweetness
but
no
funk
all
nicely
balanced
and
blended
great
body
too
and
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
too
unique
but
an
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
overall
ommegang
once
again
shows
why
they
rarely
disappoint
the
hennepin
is
a
zesty
refreshing
example
of
the
farmhouse
style
when
the
spring
weather
warms
you
need
to
have
a
bottle
of
this
i
havent
had
many
saisons
but
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
its
style
and
one
i
will
repeatedly
return
to
m
d
delicious
very
drinkable
and
alluring
lovely
balance
this
is
my
first
time
experiencing
both
this
beer
and
this
style
i
found
it
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
look
forward
to
drinking
this
and
other
saisons
in
the
future
overall
a
great
representation
of
a
great
style
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
better
american
saisons
out
there
i
had
this
first
on
tap
at
fire
and
vine
excellent
was
the
first
word
that
came
to
my
head
it
was
amber
with
12
inch
of
head
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
fruity
aroma
that
made
me
want
to
dive
in
first
sip
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
my
wife
isnt
as
into
beer
as
me
but
i
had
to
share
since
then
i
found
bottles
at
the
local
total
wine
shop
this
is
one
i
will
always
look
far
again
d
not
bad
high
carbonation
may
limit
consumption
purchased
at
beer
crazy
in
urbandale
pours
a
lightly
hazy
brilliant
blonde
color
with
a
big
loose
head
that
diminishes
to
a
smaller
slightly
tighter
head
scents
range
from
spicy
hops
to
sweet
bannana
aromas
the
taste
is
fantasically
balanced
with
dry
hop
bitterness
and
some
fruity
esters
the
palate
is
lightly
sharp
md
on
the
lighter
side
with
nice
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
and
overall
enjoyable
while
i
really
like
it
its
not
something
i
will
reach
for
often
d
probably
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
now
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
trappist
dubbels
very
refreshing
and
the
citrus
is
just
awesome
d
goes
down
extremely
easy
and
really
evolves
as
it
warms
up
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
especially
after
sort
of
discounting
ommegang
based
on
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
tried
well
worth
the
pick
up
and
from
my
experience
would
be
worth
some
time
in
the
cellar
dgreat
hidden
abv
sits
lightly
in
the
stomach
good
taste
make
this
an
extraordinarily
drinkable
beer
drinkability
very
chuggable
refreshing
easy
7
7
is
not
noticeable
only
problem
would
be
the
linearity
of
this
beer
might
get
tired
of
the
same
sournesstart
apple
taste
running
throughout
otherwise
outstanding
easily
the
best
saison
out
there
d
this
is
terrific
drinking
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
and
widely
available
d
this
beer
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
a
nice
drinker
which
i
always
enjoy
the
abv
is
high
but
this
beer
doesnt
really
drink
like
it
i
really
like
beer
and
need
to
pick
it
up
more
often
to
be
honest
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
fine
white
mousse
head
aroma
is
of
clover
honey
and
white
pepper
taste
is
fruity
and
wet
stone
mouthfeel
has
a
decent
body
as
this
is
a
farmhouse
ale
i
paired
this
with
a
french
altantique
cheese
and
a
rustic
baguette
magnificent
this
is
not
my
type
of
beer
and
it
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
while
before
i
tried
it
but
gotta
say
this
is
a
keeper
and
will
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
this
so
far
is
the
only
saison
that
i
would
buy
again
hennepin
was
suggested
to
me
when
i
mentioned
to
my
local
beer
store
clerk
that
i
had
had
a
farmhouse
ale
the
other
day
honestly
i
was
just
makin
conversation
the
farmhouse
ale
i
had
wasnt
that
great
however
the
ommegang
hennepin
isnt
like
the
other
one
i
tried
its
light
years
beyond
the
first
farmhouse
ale
i
tasted
it
has
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
hint
of
haze
the
initial
bite
is
like
a
strong
german
beer
but
it
quickly
wanes
into
a
mild
smooth
earthy
taste
as
far
as
saisons
go
this
is
the
best
ive
had
d
bring
on
the
summer
work
and
keep
these
nearby
and
youll
be
a
happy
camper
if
you
like
the
type
than
this
is
your
beer
from
the
tap
hennepin
poured
a
sunshiny
gold
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
spumy
onecentimeter
head
the
first
sip
left
a
strong
impression
of
pears
that
receded
with
subsequent
sips
unraveling
a
sparkling
apple
cider
note
with
a
trace
of
soapiness
and
lichen
on
the
finish
for
having
so
mellow
a
flavor
the
beer
was
surprisingly
crisp
and
thin
in
fact
i
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
heavier
feel
but
perhaps
my
opinion
was
swayed
by
a
craving
for
warmth
on
a
chilly
day
in
february
well
i
found
it
thoroughly
drinkable
nonetheless
and
look
forward
to
sampling
it
again
when
springtime
rolls
around
overall
i
really
do
not
care
for
this
beer
it
is
too
sharp
and
lacks
all
the
depth
of
flavor
and
character
that
i
love
in
saisons
this
is
the
fourth
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
an
i
have
never
enjoyed
it
i
think
im
done
giving
it
chances
overall
a
fantastic
beer
cheers
golden
cloudy
appearance
with
very
nice
lacy
head
pours
nice
but
pull
back
on
the
bottle
at
the
last
second
to
hold
back
the
sediment
really
nice
floral
smell
yeasty
spicy
flavor
done
right
with
pure
satisfaction
in
the
finish
snappy
mouthfeel
thanks
to
great
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
superior
beer
bright
yellow
with
a
faint
haze
and
some
floaties
maybe
a
hint
of
amber
thick
frothy
white
head
smells
earthy
spicy
cloves
and
somewhat
medicinal
hints
of
alcohol
taste
has
some
light
sweetness
upfront
more
earthiness
and
spiciness
and
a
phenolic
character
light
herbal
hops
on
the
back
end
finishes
incredibly
dry
with
some
faint
lingering
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
soapy
huge
prickly
carbonation
very
drinkable
taste
upfront
is
tart
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
very
good
mouthfeel
crisp
tart
refreshing
ale
alcohol
definitely
warmed
me
up
with
every
progressive
sip
in
spite
of
the
higher
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
very
good
lacing
along
the
insides
of
the
glass
this
is
a
very
good
saison
from
ommegang
paired
very
well
with
some
spicy
curry
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
type
of
ale
had
this
on
tap
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
active
carbonation
and
spotty
lacing
served
in
a
fluted
glass
about
14
oz
peppery
spice
with
banana
and
clove
on
the
nose
that
leads
to
a
nice
peppery
forefront
and
sharp
bite
on
the
palate
i
just
ate
onions
on
my
sandwich
though
i
feel
a
faint
grape
like
mouthfeel
in
the
back
and
finished
spicy
and
slightly
alcoholic
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
any
occasion
d
as
with
the
style
again
more
wit
beer
than
saison
its
light
crisp
and
delicious
this
is
quite
easy
to
drink
though
its
on
the
high
end
7
7abv
drinkability
delicious
get
better
as
it
warms
would
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
d
huge
drinky
on
this
lacks
in
some
spots
but
extremely
refreshing
and
tasty
m
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
feels
a
little
thin
this
may
be
a
product
of
the
keg
that
it
came
from
but
it
is
still
highly
enjoyable
none
the
less
d
crisp
clean
and
very
nicely
built
beer
love
the
flavors
and
the
subtle
belgian
funk
would
highly
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
as
its
easy
drinking
and
at
a
reasonable
price
point
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
heavy
chalice
glass
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
sticky
thick
dish
soap
sudsdivinity
type
of
head
the
head
leaves
fantastic
lacing
with
big
clumps
of
head
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
has
a
slightly
skunky
hallertau
hops
note
with
a
bit
of
soured
fruit
and
a
really
nice
farm
funk
flavor
is
fantastic
with
a
great
sourness
melded
very
well
with
a
farm
funk
light
lemon
citrus
pils
grainy
flavors
and
a
light
vanilla
at
the
end
the
beer
feels
very
smooth
with
a
great
density
for
the
style
overall
this
is
great
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
nose
and
some
very
balanced
but
complex
flavors
will
be
picking
more
of
these
up
this
brew
was
so
fucking
good
i
went
back
the
next
night
for
another
and
more
taquitos
d
pretty
good
although
the
high
level
of
carbonation
may
limit
its
drinkablility
somewhat
nice
offering
from
ommegang
not
the
best
saison
ive
had
but
good
glad
i
can
get
it
easily
the
cpj
this
beer
tastes
like
typical
hennepin
it
really
doesnt
taste
much
different
than
fresher
batches
i
have
tasted
in
the
past
it
is
still
extremely
drinkable
and
lighter
something
i
have
come
to
expect
from
this
beer
its
kind
of
cool
to
see
how
this
beer
compares
to
a
newer
vintage
on
second
thought
the
beer
has
gained
more
of
a
champagney
taste
a
very
delicate
balance
of
sweetness
bubbles
and
a
little
dryness
very
cool
glad
my
neighbor
had
the
patience
to
age
this
one
drinkability
i
would
rate
this
beer
well
on
drinkability
with
everything
going
on
from
smell
to
flavors
it
was
really
nice
yes
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
to
it
so
it
is
not
sessionable
but
it
was
very
tasty
d
due
to
the
persistent
bitterness
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
an
enjoyable
ale
d
pretty
high
im
a
big
fan
of
saisons
because
of
their
complexity
and
fairly
easy
drinkability
hennepin
was
yellowgold
in
color
and
hazy
it
had
a
large
rocky
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
was
yeast
and
spices
clove
and
pepper
the
taste
was
yeast
flavors
and
spices
with
clove
pepper
and
citrus
it
had
a
long
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
hennepin
is
a
good
saison
that
is
crisp
refreshing
and
well
worth
trying
out
drinkabilty
its
just
strong
enough
and
alcohol
is
up
enough
that
1
or
2
is
good
very
tasty
for
the
style
one
of
the
better
farm
ales
ive
had
a
very
nice
americanmade
saison
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
even
at
the
price
plus
its
available
pretty
much
everywhere
i
must
say
i
would
go
pretty
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
hold
of
this
one
if
i
needed
to
the
mouthfeel
is
a
prickly
medium
bodied
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
find
it
greatly
enjoyable
even
so
that
this
style
of
brew
is
not
what
i
usually
drink
a
great
brew
which
i
defenetely
pick
up
again
and
a
brewery
which
i
will
try
more
from
i
feel
kinda
guilty
not
giving
this
beer
all
5s
i
see
why
so
many
love
hennepin
so
much
this
is
one
spectacular
beer
that
i
will
come
back
to
frequently
overall
its
a
nice
drinkable
belgian
without
breaking
the
bank
d
decent
but
an
cheap
awful
aftertaste
in
my
opinion
d
bought
a
keg
of
this
for
new
years
eve
to
go
along
with
michelob
ultra
group
was
bmc
drinkers
for
the
most
part
but
they
were
all
adventurous
and
stepped
out
of
their
comfort
zone
it
was
a
huge
hit
with
everyone
says
it
was
so
much
more
flavorful
yet
refreshing
and
light
drink
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
some
more
the
next
chance
i
get
it
was
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
the
body
crisp
and
sharp
with
a
nice
semidry
finish
drinkability
was
excellent
as
is
typical
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
is
certainly
worth
seeking
out
if
you
havent
already
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
i
like
that
they
kept
it
fairly
simple
i
will
definitley
go
for
this
one
again
d
a
nice
saison
i
just
wish
i
chose
a
better
time
to
pop
it
than
new
years
eve
drinkability
absolutely
d
very
high
i
absolutely
love
this
one
it
is
funky
yet
still
very
refreshing
one
of
if
not
the
best
american
saison
on
the
market
today
d
amazing
was
sad
when
bottle
was
empty
very
nice
saison
good
offering
from
ommegang
if
you
like
ommegang
or
saisons
its
a
must
try
poured
into
a
wheat
glass
while
pouring
it
slowly
the
enormous
three
finger
head
went
all
the
way
to
the
top
of
the
glass
it
has
a
very
nice
light
yellow
color
not
very
cloudy
actually
quite
clear
besides
all
the
yeast
sediment
that
was
floating
around
i
read
a
few
reviews
and
no
one
really
mentioned
this
i
hope
my
bottle
wasnt
tainted
the
smell
is
a
very
nice
yeasty
balance
with
some
nice
citrus
to
it
has
a
nice
hopness
aroma
in
it
as
well
taste
is
an
amazing
acidic
but
nice
citrus
taste
has
a
good
balance
of
bitter
and
sweetness
to
it
its
very
bubbly
in
your
mouth
so
it
is
a
nice
warm
feeling
as
for
drinkablility
i
would
say
this
beer
would
be
best
served
on
a
warm
day
with
a
nice
grilled
burger
so
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
d
quite
drinkable
a
very
approachable
belgian
the
flavor
is
much
more
mellow
on
tap
than
from
he
bottle
the
flavor
seems
to
have
more
room
for
subtle
flavor
to
rise
up
bubblegum
funky
yeast
sweet
grain
and
a
rich
fruitiness
come
through
too
over
all
a
great
saison
mouth
feel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
high
overall
i
have
really
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
out
as
it
has
received
some
pretty
great
reviews
and
is
something
that
isnt
available
where
i
live
but
i
was
really
let
down
with
this
however
i
should
note
that
i
think
i
opened
the
bottle
too
soon
after
taking
it
out
of
the
fridge
the
second
glass
that
i
had
was
better
than
the
first
and
some
of
the
things
that
i
look
for
in
a
saison
biscuity
spicy
funky
and
citrusy
came
out
slightly
as
it
warmed
even
then
though
this
was
like
a
light
saison
if
such
a
thing
existed
i
would
certainly
recommend
serving
this
closer
to
room
temperature
and
will
if
i
decide
to
pick
up
another
bottle
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
am
going
to
have
to
keep
in
the
fridge
my
wife
is
gonna
love
this
one
pours
light
yellow
with
some
cloudyness
huge
head
couldnt
pour
the
whole
bottle
into
the
glass
head
is
pure
white
smells
citrusy
floural
and
grassy
tastes
great
yeasty
wheat
malt
with
a
little
sour
bitter
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
cant
really
taste
the
7
7
abv
delicious
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
and
again
and
again
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
ommegang
lets
just
say
ill
be
trying
the
others
drinks
great
a
wonderful
beer
i
want
more
this
beers
a
bright
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
monsterous
lacing
head
the
smell
resembled
a
skunk
the
taste
is
complex
mellow
at
first
the
a
huge
rush
of
flavor
very
nice
to
drink
no
weird
flavors
but
it
seems
like
most
people
dont
like
saisons
so
they
may
not
like
this
one
overall
a
really
good
beer
great
example
of
the
style
beer
poured
a
cloudy
pineapple
juice
color
with
a
massive
white
head
aroma
was
sour
apple
yeast
gingercoriander
peppery
taste
was
light
and
spicy
with
subtle
umami
on
the
aftertaste
fruity
and
tart
with
a
light
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
had
high
carbonation
light
spicy
texture
was
champagnelike
overall
an
excellent
and
highly
drinkable
beer
lively
and
refreshing
complex
and
satisfying
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
its
actually
scary
how
drinkable
it
is
for
the
alcohol
content
a
six
pack
of
this
could
make
for
a
very
good
or
very
bad
night
drinkable
almost
too
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
i
am
not
sure
if
my
grades
do
it
justice
based
on
style
so
i
just
graded
based
on
how
i
enjoyed
it
give
this
one
a
try
pours
hazy
light
straw
with
a
lively
2
inch
head
dry
citrus
and
yeast
with
a
bit
of
earthy
spice
carbonation
really
crackles
across
the
tongue
and
mouth
and
drinkability
for
me
is
quite
high
this
was
one
of
the
first
saisons
i
ever
had
and
is
my
fallback
saison
when
availability
or
wallet
contents
is
an
issue
i
had
several
goblets
of
this
great
beer
at
a
local
german
restaurant
several
weeks
back
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
very
impressed
with
it
hence
the
several
goblets
i
reminded
me
of
my
favorite
saisons
from
saint
somewhere
i
would
definitely
order
again
when
i
see
it
on
tap
somewhere
a
simple
beer
to
drink
it
tastes
good
and
provides
a
crisp
feeling
as
it
goes
down
despite
the
spices
and
high
alcohol
theres
no
burning
whatsover
it
actually
seems
to
cool
you
would
make
a
great
beer
for
warm
or
cold
weather
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
especially
on
a
hot
day
now
ill
know
better
for
next
summer
pours
a
yellow
golden
haze
with
life
has
a
medium
foam
head
has
a
belgium
spice
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
and
bananas
has
more
carbonation
then
other
saisons
i
have
had
gives
it
a
creamier
feel
has
a
sweet
grassy
taste
with
a
slight
bitterness
very
tasty
i
did
not
remember
this
brew
being
so
good
but
my
palate
is
a
bit
more
experienced
then
it
was
the
last
time
i
tried
it
drinkable
but
im
feeling
one
and
done
right
now
ill
definatly
come
back
to
this
top
notch
saison
but
i
do
prefer
just
a
touch
of
funk
imho
drinkability
is
good
one
of
the
few
saisons
sold
in
12oz
bottles
so
that
adds
but
i
do
question
how
true
in
taste
is
it
tasted
fruity
with
cleansing
effervescence
and
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
finish
and
momentary
soft
sweetness
of
alcohol
along
with
some
dark
fruit
like
malts
at
the
end
slightly
warming
good
drinkability
kinda
reminds
me
of
duvel
in
some
ways
which
makes
sense
but
i
couldnt
get
into
this
one
much
feels
too
boozy
and
just
heavy
and
uncomfortable
when
it
reaches
your
guts
flavors
that
were
present
didnt
really
leave
me
wanting
more
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
lasting
foamy
head
and
much
lacing
aroma
is
of
piney
hops
yeast
biscuit
malt
and
some
pear
mediumfull
crisp
body
yeast
sugar
biscuit
malt
and
piney
earthy
hops
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
long
dry
finish
very
nice
rustic
brew
this
is
a
real
aggressive
saison
i
can
tell
its
extremely
wellmade
as
ommegang
doesnt
mess
around
when
it
comes
to
making
good
belgian
beer
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
rather
strong
alcoholic
character
but
perhaps
thats
how
it
should
be
i
admire
the
complexity
and
adventurous
quality
definitely
worth
pouring
this
slow
to
get
the
right
pour
out
of
it
very
pleasing
beer
and
will
be
buying
another
one
in
the
near
term
notes
another
good
offering
from
ommegang
drinkability
probably
the
most
drinkable
saison
i
have
had
yet
a
refreshing
treat
for
the
warmer
months
to
be
sure
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
hands
down
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
notes
a
really
flavorful
and
complex
saison
thats
not
afraid
to
be
different
or
take
a
few
chances
luckily
those
chances
pay
off
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
soapy
head
and
great
lacing
that
never
goes
away
smells
of
coriander
orange
or
lemon
zest
and
a
lot
of
booze
tastes
of
lemon
peel
a
warming
alcohol
hop
bitterness
and
coriander
and
black
pepper
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
has
a
high
drinkability
d
drinkability
is
high
a
very
slight
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
is
the
only
reminder
that
this
is
a
7
70
beer
as
it
drinks
almost
too
easily
an
excellent
offering
from
ommegang
and
a
great
representation
d
quaffable
to
say
the
least
very
enjoyable
drink
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
light
refreshing
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
yet
complex
really
must
be
tried
the
best
saison
you
can
get
any
day
in
any
good
store
wow
taste
is
bursting
with
citrus
and
fresh
bitterness
lemons
and
lime
are
here
theres
a
good
bite
of
spiciness
from
the
yeast
thats
nice
as
well
as
some
cloves
and
ginger
and
even
a
bit
of
pepper
mouthfeel
is
really
huge
from
the
carbonation
maks
it
seem
like
a
belgian
tripel
overall
really
solid
saison
d
very
drinkable
even
with
a
fairly
high
apv
and
complexity
of
the
flavors
poured
an
almost
clear
golden
yellow
topped
by
a
fluffy
crown
of
white
head
providing
excellent
lace
and
retention
bready
sweet
tones
with
just
the
right
combinations
of
lemon
zest
clove
coriander
and
white
grape
without
too
much
funk
like
many
saisons
taste
was
even
more
impressive
with
all
the
aforementioned
flavors
and
a
champagnelike
dryness
especially
in
the
finish
clean
lightbodied
in
spite
of
the
abv
and
bubbly
it
accentuated
the
flavors
nicely
i
wish
it
came
in
a
bigger
goblet
there
because
i
had
to
take
small
sips
to
really
enjoy
it
for
all
its
worth
overall
a
nice
example
of
an
american
saison
its
the
the
traditional
componets
lemon
spice
pepper
its
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
super
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
this
beer
is
one
of
the
all
stars
of
the
american
brewed
saisons
and
one
of
my
favorites
i
am
not
sure
if
the
12oz
bottles
are
a
new
thing
or
if
i
had
never
noticed
but
i
am
pretty
excited
to
be
able
to
enjoy
this
beer
without
finding
an
occasion
where
a
750
ml
works
do
at
7
7
the
drinkability
gets
dinged
a
notch
because
its
such
a
distinct
taste
i
dont
think
anyone
would
want
any
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
that
being
said
those
one
or
two
would
be
the
best
looking
if
not
the
best
tasting
beers
one
would
have
that
night
another
winner
from
brewery
ommegang
this
beer
appears
to
be
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
coarse
white
foam
head
the
beer
smells
of
pears
crisp
red
apples
sour
white
grapes
mango
and
slight
cinnamon
notes
notes
the
flavor
is
a
mixture
of
old
champagne
slight
flavors
of
orange
and
grapefruit
and
some
peppery
notes
in
the
back
this
is
a
nice
complex
beer
and
its
not
too
harsh
on
the
sour
which
is
one
thing
that
i
tend
to
avoid
as
far
as
the
style
is
concerned
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
it
is
quite
prickly
in
nature
the
remainder
of
elements
for
the
mouthfeel
are
rather
nice
still
it
drinks
well
it
was
the
right
price
not
a
bad
saison
for
my
money
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
quite
fabulous
its
crystal
clear
and
the
entire
vessel
is
teeming
with
effervescence
the
color
is
a
light
shade
of
yellow
the
head
is
huge
and
white
containing
a
plethora
of
bubbles
as
it
fades
over
an
hour
or
so
it
coats
the
glass
in
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spices
straw
grass
lemons
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
with
notes
of
lemon
grass
orange
zest
clove
lemon
straw
there
is
a
subtle
spicy
kick
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
nice
feel
with
an
above
average
carbonation
level
this
is
a
great
saison
and
from
the
united
states
no
less
i
definitely
recommend
it
d
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
strangely
more
of
a
sipper
than
something
i
couldnt
put
down
which
is
unusual
for
me
when
it
comes
to
saisons
i
think
the
balance
was
slightly
off
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
look
for
in
the
future
i
think
i
was
hoping
for
something
else
probably
something
comparable
to
what
ive
had
in
other
saisons
in
terms
of
balance
at
least
perhaps
its
just
a
different
style
saison
perhaps
i
need
to
branch
out
a
little
more
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
takin
another
swing
at
this
brew
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
solid
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
coriander
and
lemon
zest
with
a
touch
of
minor
caramel
in
the
very
very
back
the
taste
follows
along
a
similarlylandscaped
path
though
theres
more
wheat
and
a
touch
o
relatively
minor
funk
hanging
around
the
corners
and
edges
and
whatnot
and
when
i
say
minor
i
mean
aa
maybe
even
a
who
doesnt
love
watching
a
dunedin
game
am
i
right
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
solid
saison
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
dvery
good
dont
be
scared
by
the
7
7
everything
here
is
in
wonderful
balance
serving
type
bottle
perhaps
the
most
salient
feature
of
this
ale
still
is
the
consistency
of
its
quality
ive
been
drinking
it
since
2003
and
am
continuously
impressed
with
how
steadfastly
it
meets
the
expectations
i
know
hennepin
is
a
good
beer
but
i
will
just
have
to
taste
it
again
from
a
bottle
because
this
table
tap
experience
was
not
very
good
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
would
say
bust
it
out
for
a
back
patio
summer
day
with
friends
and
classic
rock
value
was
alright
for
a
bomber
got
this
for
8
with
tax
a
good
price
for
a
good
beer
d
drinkable
but
i
couldnt
do
a
lot
of
these
d
moderate
easy
enough
to
drink
but
just
not
in
my
wheelhouse
a
good
beer
but
not
for
me
so
it
goes
taste
is
subtle
very
nice
and
very
refreshing
slight
hop
spice
lemon
honey
and
clove
are
the
main
players
everything
works
well
together
very
crisp
mouthfeel
with
prickly
carbonation
very
nice
brew
and
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
poured
from
bottle
into
ikea
beer
mug
poured
amber
gold
with
a
hint
of
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
a
creamy
yet
strong
citrus
smell
a
very
flat
front
with
only
a
little
bit
of
citrus
taste
coming
through
creamy
midpalate
and
finish
with
an
aroma
and
taste
that
reminds
me
of
green
apples
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
fine
carbonation
tempers
the
rich
creamy
texture
for
a
perfectly
balanced
mouthfeel
d
residual
sweetness
keeps
the
drinkability
score
average
for
me
a
bold
saison
such
as
hennepin
is
a
sipper
and
a
seldom
one
at
that
d
a
really
complex
beer
thirty
minutes
into
it
i
was
still
picking
out
new
flavors
this
could
be
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
one
i
will
compare
other
to
poured
a
light
hazy
gold
with
a
big
head
that
took
forever
to
die
down
bouquet
is
a
big
wallop
of
citrus
and
spice
and
the
flavor
holds
the
same
as
well
as
some
fruitiness
and
malt
and
it
all
blends
together
seemlessly
and
just
like
their
abbey
ale
im
simply
amazed
i
can
get
this
at
trader
joes
for
around
the
8
range
overall
ommegang
does
well
in
their
saison
offering
conclusion
i
wasnt
as
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
had
hoped
to
be
but
i
have
limited
experience
with
this
style
so
i
may
simply
not
be
able
to
tell
why
it
is
rated
as
high
as
it
is
drinkability
is
fantastic
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
not
filling
at
all
quite
drinkable
but
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
and
flavor
compared
to
the
better
belgian
examples
originally
i
would
have
excused
this
based
on
value
but
over
the
years
ommegang
has
gone
up
in
price
making
me
less
inclined
to
choose
their
offerings
over
those
that
are
the
source
of
their
inspiration
amazing
beer
especially
since
this
is
an
american
brewed
belgian
style
with
the
yeast
complexity
to
die
for
a
rightous
value
to
at
only
5
99
for
750
d
very
much
i
like
ommegang
and
this
didnt
disappoint
d
if
this
was
lower
in
abv
i
would
drink
more
of
it
either
way
you
gotta
try
this
scott
drinkability
quite
delicious
and
quite
possibly
the
best
saision
ive
had
to
date
granted
i
havent
had
many
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
something
everyone
should
try
once
truly
a
classic
in
the
style
pleasant
tonguecurling
dryness
is
straight
to
style
begs
for
another
sip
making
this
a
solid
enjoyable
saison
i
am
biased
as
this
is
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
solid
standard
takes
a
slightly
drinkability
hit
because
the
strength
doesnt
keep
it
sessionable
however
id
not
hesistate
to
give
a
full
bottle
a
try
a
very
full
mouthfeel
from
all
the
carbonation
but
a
beer
that
at
the
same
time
finishes
very
dry
these
make
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
great
stuff
the
carbonation
splashes
these
flavors
deep
into
my
tongue
impressing
upon
me
the
urgency
of
this
flavor
i
will
never
doubt
a
saison
again
d
i
generally
like
saisons
so
i
feel
i
could
drink
this
pretty
easily
however
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
but
the
bitterness
is
really
overpowering
and
unpleasant
ill
have
to
revisit
i
know
this
can
be
better
then
this
d
this
is
a
extremely
drinkable
brew
great
tastes
and
aromas
while
still
being
light
and
crisp
good
hidden
abv
and
i
am
craving
another
one
overall
despite
the
solvency
and
slight
metallic
taste
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
most
of
the
flavor
comes
through
after
drinking
and
in
the
after
taste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
an
october
evening
at
a
bonfire
or
barn
party
this
bottle
could
have
been
aged
a
little
long
it
was
still
a
great
beer
saison
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
am
very
passionate
about
it
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
am
a
saison
nerd
i
havent
tasted
hennepin
for
a
few
years
until
tonight
yet
it
is
just
as
poor
as
i
remember
it
being
i
cant
understand
how
people
think
this
is
a
good
saison
if
you
like
this
beer
then
i
implore
you
to
check
out
better
examples
of
the
style
i
love
hennepin
and
have
enjoyed
other
bottles
as
much
as
fantome
and
dupont
so
this
bottle
was
a
semiletdown
which
is
rare
for
ommegang
great
brewery
overall
this
is
the
best
american
made
saison
looks
great
tastes
great
and
you
could
definitly
drink
a
few
of
these
d
really
nice
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
would
definately
drink
again
very
nice
for
non
craft
beer
drinkers
i
shared
this
with
family
and
it
was
enjoyed
by
all
perhaps
i
should
buy
some
saisons
that
are
actually
brewed
in
belgium
and
do
some
comparing
but
i
was
certainly
surprised
by
the
restraint
of
my
first
beer
of
this
style
ive
been
impressed
with
everything
from
ommegang
but
even
moreso
this
i
honestly
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
forgot
that
duvel
owns
them
now
but
i
wont
hold
it
against
them
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
flute
glass
beautiful
straw
yellow
carmel
color
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
lacing
hung
onto
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smelled
like
a
typical
farmhouse
alesaison
with
its
earthy
aroma
the
taste
was
a
superb
complex
blend
of
some
spice
malt
and
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
quick
with
the
dry
aftertaste
that
is
unique
to
this
style
incredibly
delicous
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
what
i
was
drinking
d
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
although
it
would
eventually
catch
up
and
do
damage
from
the
abv
very
smooth
and
refreshing
a
simple
taste
for
me
but
would
definitely
try
again
not
my
favorite
saison
by
far
i
think
this
might
be
an
issue
of
personal
taste
i
wont
be
searching
this
one
out
again
extremely
drinkable
in
warmer
weather
due
to
sheer
refreshingness
if
they
werent
so
pricey
id
have
no
problem
drinking
this
very
often
cheers
enjoy
this
well
crafted
saison
put
on
some
good
music
and
you
will
have
no
doubts
about
why
this
is
ommegangs
best
seller
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
every
day
of
the
year
but
its
something
special
when
summer
is
turning
into
fall
and
youre
surrounded
by
different
pumpkin
infusions
but
you
choose
this
beer
over
all
of
them

compost1032386343hennepin
d
dryness
and
complexity
of
the
beer
are
a
great
combo
notes
nice
saison
with
a
good
balance
and
mix
of
spice
sweetness
and
bitterness
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
definitely
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
still
a
very
drinkable
saison
d
excellent
brew
this
is
a
good
saison
to
compare
others
to
everything
about
this
beer
leads
me
to
believe
that
it
is
highly
drinkable
i
do
not
foresee
any
problems
finishing
off
this
750ml
bottle
by
myself
i
except
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
abv
by
the
time
im
finished
but
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
to
enjoy
at
home
on
a
warm
afternoonevening
id
recommend
this
beer
to
any
fan
of
the
style
dthis
is
a
well
balanced
and
delicious
saison
it
tends
to
lead
more
towards
the
wit
but
still
seems
to
have
hints
of
that
summer
funk
in
the
back
tasty
summer
ale
d
all
in
all
a
quite
good
saison
not
the
best
one
ive
come
across
but
it
lived
up
to
they
hype
very
drinkable
at
7
8
bought
a
4pack
of
this
after
a
recent
beerrut
its
a
great
example
of
this
style
and
one
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
needing
something
to
excite
their
taste
buds
again
the
pour
was
good
a
nice
goldenoragnge
body
with
a
thick
1
5inch
head
smell
was
citrusy
sweet
and
of
yeast
and
clove
taste
echoed
that
with
more
pronounced
yeast
notes
and
a
sweeter
finish
i
could
drink
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
great
drinkability
at
7
7
this
will
beer
will
get
you
feeling
good
pretty
quickly
without
sacrificing
taste
drinkability
it
isnt
too
heavy
or
thick
and
the
flavor
completely
outweighs
the
alcohol
i
would
drink
this
as
often
as
possible
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
drinkability
is
good
its
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
very
good
tasting
beer
the
spices
and
the
citrus
meshed
very
well
together
in
it
and
made
for
a
very
good
beer
d
very
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
yeah
hennepin
is
a
favorite
of
mine
in
any
form
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
very
good
job
ommegang
d
an
ok
saison
but
nothing
amazing
it
smelled
pretty
good
but
thought
the
high
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
hurt
it
a
bit
no
funk
anywhere
either
would
try
again
but
wouldnt
really
seek
out
my
first
sip
of
this
glorious
beer
was
ontap
and
it
was
slightly
better
imo
d
another
beer
that
i
could
drink
quite
often
drinks
easy
the
spice
might
ware
on
me
but
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
few
would
be
no
problem
the
most
over
rated
beer
on
this
site
imho
id
have
to
revisit
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
or
something
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
wonderfully
balanced
flavors
of
caramel
followed
by
orange
spice
and
a
long
floral
finish
pleasant
refreshing
and
somehow
light
despite
the
interplay
of
full
flavors
first
time
drinking
this
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
good
place
to
start
if
you
are
trying
saisons
for
the
first
time
this
is
a
real
aggressive
saison
i
can
tell
its
extremely
wellmade
as
ommegang
doesnt
mess
around
when
it
comes
to
making
good
belgian
beer
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
rather
strong
alcoholic
character
but
perhaps
thats
how
it
should
be
i
admire
the
complexity
and
adventurous
quality
very
drinkable
but
overall
this
is
not
quite
as
amazing
as
i
expected
dpretty
damn
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
not
my
favorite
saison
but
good
to
throw
in
the
mix
now
and
then
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
smells
of
orange
warm
yeasty
bread
and
some
sweetness
light
bready
initial
taste
with
a
sweet
citrus
finish
and
some
very
subtle
grassy
floral
and
peppery
phenols
mouth
feel
is
just
a
touch
thin
with
a
moderate
to
high
carbonation
level
i
dont
think
this
is
the
most
amazing
example
of
a
saison
but
it
is
consistently
good
and
usually
serves
as
a
nice
standby
for
me
at
restaurants
as
its
neutralness
seems
to
pair
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
d
a
clean
and
crisp
beer
great
for
appetizers
or
just
an
everyday
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
d
meh
a
serviceable
brew
but
not
something
i
will
bother
having
again
as
there
are
too
many
better
options
on
the
shelf
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
light
appearance
with
nine
finger
fluffy
head
the
head
stayed
forever
smell
was
bright
and
lemony
taste
was
light
to
medium
with
a
bit
of
citrus
my
first
farmhouse
saison
didnt
disappoint
mouthfeel
was
light
and
spritzy
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
complex
yet
still
light
enough
to
drink
several
of
i
dunno
you
could
just
go
buy
6
sn
kellarweis
or
something
for
this
price
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
sticking
around
smell
has
a
good
bit
of
earthiness
along
with
some
spice
and
a
few
belgianyeast
esters
quite
pungent
a
bit
more
so
than
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
and
nice
dash
of
citrusearthy
dryness
drinkability
is
very
very
good
really
wish
this
was
sold
in
4packs
around
here
ommegang
got
me
into
craft
beer
and
this
is
another
great
offering
from
them
my
first
saison
it
has
me
craving
more
from
the
style
great
beer
drinkability
excellent
finished
my
12
oz
in
no
time
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
anticipated
but
this
is
a
strong
brew
overall
ive
only
tried
a
couple
of
saisons
so
i
dont
know
too
much
about
them
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
most
of
ommegangs
offerings
delicious
beer
at
a
decent
price
taste
is
somewhere
in
between
a
wit
hefe
and
saison
has
plenty
of
yeast
esters
but
not
really
all
that
funky
or
bright
like
a
dupont
one
of
the
better
american
renditions
for
sure
but
the
malt
seems
a
little
sweet
and
not
grainy
enough
while
the
lemon
feels
more
like
an
american
wheat
than
a
saison
hop
bitterness
is
spot
on
and
provides
a
nice
cleansing
on
the
palate
tough
love
i
guess
as
saisons
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
tend
to
grade
harder
i
like
it
but
feel
like
it
lacks
a
bit
in
personality
and
farmhouse
funkiness
id
like
a
yeast
with
more
personality
less
sweetness
and
some
more
raw
grainy
aspect
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
the
abv
is
a
little
high
and
will
hit
you
before
you
get
tired
of
the
beer
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
for
ahile
drinkability
very
drinkable
im
in
love
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
big
billowing
white
head
that
recedes
slowly
with
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
fruits
and
citrus
some
spices
some
cloves
its
a
nice
bouquet
taste
is
apples
and
pears
with
a
citrus
and
slight
lemon
tart
hit
with
a
banana
and
clove
slight
hop
hit
mouth
feel
was
medium
and
very
crisp
full
of
flavors
in
a
well
balanced
saison
very
drinkable
and
a
pleasure
to
have
abv
well
hidden
drinkability
complex
flavors
strength
and
price
make
this
one
a
winner
constructed
almost
perfectly
delivers
powerful
product
this
was
a
highly
enjoyable
experience
d
its
amazingly
drinkable
and
approachable
to
a
noob
great
stuff
at
a
great
time
drinkability
this
is
just
a
hell
of
a
good
beer
it
has
that
big
beer
feel
but
its
still
refreshing
its
really
good
anytime
and
with
almost
anything
look
for
it
in
the
12
oz
bottles
not
that
you
cant
down
a
750
alone
but
theyre
a
much
better
deal
pours
opaque
straw
gold
with
a
dense
dense
puffy
white
head
that
eagerly
leaves
lacing
all
around
the
glass
initially
smells
like
rock
candy
and
then
the
more
familiar
belgian
saison
yeast
fruity
and
floral
with
a
small
amount
of
farmhouse
notes
and
vanilla
tastes
great
havent
had
this
in
a
while
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
clean
malt
bill
and
mild
hop
presence
dry
but
could
be
plenty
more
for
the
style
again
there
is
a
vanilla
like
candy
thing
going
on
and
i
can
only
imagine
it
is
from
the
yeast
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
think
that
vanilla
thing
is
actually
just
some
phenol
type
flavor
wow
great
mouthfeel
awsome
bottle
conditioning
by
ommegang
other
than
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
almost
8
percent
and
you
cant
tell
it
is
it
is
highly
drinkable
love
it
out
of
the
few
saisons
ive
had
this
is
definitely
the
best
which
makes
me
look
forward
to
more
of
the
style
it
seems
to
spin
on
the
tongue
and
then
go
down
smooth
a
well
carbonated
beer
that
feels
really
light
going
down
drinks
like
summer
the
floral
nose
and
enticing
spicy
flavors
really
agree
with
my
current
palate
and
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
dialed
in
perfectly
an
unexpected
treat
from
ommegang
for
a
brewer
who
puts
out
abbey
ale
three
philosophers
this
was
extremely
disappointing
a
firm
carbonation
supports
this
saison
from
start
to
finish
offering
complex
yeast
and
spice
notes
though
less
so
in
the
fruit
arena
light
and
well
balanced
overall
dry
and
powdery
and
again
a
different
and
superior
animal
to
its
draft
cousin
wonderfull
appearance
all
rocky
and
vibrant
head
and
pale
effervescent
beauty
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
malt
and
some
alchohol
with
little
to
no
contribution
from
the
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
as
it
is
wonderfully
balanced
by
the
mild
hop
bitterness
there
is
almost
no
flavoring
hops
just
a
little
bitterness
to
keep
the
sweet
maltiness
in
check
the
body
is
pleasant
and
satisfying
medium
mouthfeel
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
alchohol
but
is
not
too
astringent
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
very
easy
this
is
interesting
scice
this
is
a
7
7
beer
a
litlle
to
strong
for
a
saison
it
is
stilla
very
wonderfullly
balanced
farmhouse
ale
that
is
a
very
good
interpretation
on
a
beloved
style
a
very
nice
rather
big
saison
bold
flavors
and
a
smooth
fluffy
mouthfeel
a
perfect
summer
quencher
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
summer
ale
offerings
after
recently
tasting
their
three
philosophers
quad
im
really
enjoying
brewery
ommegang
fairly
authentic
american
takes
on
belgian
ales
d
carbonation
limits
the
drinkability
here
but
altogether
a
great
summer
beer
d
wonderful
absolutely
wonderful
beer
this
beer
is
so
wellbalanced
i
could
easily
finish
one
bottle
and
go
back
for
more
a
wonderful
interpretation
of
the
style
d
the
body
makes
this
quite
drinkable
though
i
do
notice
the
7
7
alcohol
smell
is
of
citrus
and
spice
and
all
things
nice
sorry
im
noticing
pepper
and
some
floral
notes
as
well
in
the
taste
i
get
coriander
clove
lemon
spice
and
malt
pleasant
warmth
from
the
booze
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
somewhat
high
carbonation
definitely
a
nice
very
drinkable
saison
i
consider
this
the
best
of
ommegangs
offerings
it
is
a
very
strong
showing
for
american
brewers
doing
the
belgian
thing
an
added
plus
is
that
this
beer
is
easy
to
come
by
in
the
states
north
east
at
least
and
is
a
fraction
of
the
price
of
some
of
its
belgian
counterparts
jd
poured
from
750
ml
bottle
into
a
unibroue
tulip
sudsy
foamy
white
head
with
nice
retention
soapy
lacing
body
is
hazy
lemony
yellow
aroma
is
a
wispy
mix
of
pepper
lemon
hops
grass
and
funk
taste
is
fruity
funky
lemon
zesty
and
delicious
maybe
the
best
domestic
interpretation
of
the
style
maybe
just
great
md
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
carbonation
crisp
and
clean
very
thirst
quenching
i
could
drink
this
again
nice
beer
d
a
great
beer
i
see
what
all
the
saison
fuss
is
about
a
great
buy
overall
very
good
i
love
sd
so
i
love
this
by
default
but
for
my
money
id
probably
choose
sd
bc
its
cheaper
just
being
honest
still
very
good
perhaps
if
they
tried
undercutting
sd
they
may
sell
more
d
this
is
my
frst
brewery
ommegang
tasting
and
i
am
impressed
hennepin
is
such
a
detailed
crafting
of
the
saison
style
that
is
ridicuously
enjoyable
the
abv
is
so
hidden
as
well
i
am
going
to
become
a
facilitator
of
the
style
by
always
having
these
bad
boys
on
stand
by
great
job
brew
omm
fairly
long
pour
needs
to
be
done
in
two
stages
the
first
attempt
results
in
a
massive
rocky
white
head
that
takes
its
time
subsiding
before
i
can
continue
haziness
lends
a
bit
of
depth
to
its
pale
straw
hue
nice
lace
very
pretty
looking
beer
creamy
mashed
banana
aroma
peppery
medicinal
phenolics
and
floral
hops
i
get
a
whiff
of
lemon
and
hay
in
the
background
lots
of
overripe
banana
in
the
flavour
too
also
quite
peppery
with
a
little
bit
of
lemony
tartness
musty
and
earthy
when
it
gets
close
to
room
temperature
noble
hops
and
a
mildly
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
feeling
light
in
the
mouth
has
a
little
bit
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
just
a
little
you
barely
notice
its
there
very
approachable
and
easy
drinking
i
found
myself
having
to
consciously
think
about
pacing
myself
as
i
drank
it
though
it
may
sound
odd
it
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizen
in
some
ways
and
a
tripel
in
others
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
for
most
states
this
and
dupont
are
the
only
or
at
least
easiest
worldclass
farmhouse
ale
to
get
your
hands
on
do
it
youll
be
glad
you
did
then
look
for
more
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
especially
in
warm
weather
readily
available
and
high
quality
a
bottle
from
wegmans
that
my
mom
brought
back
to
ontario
for
me
thanks
mom
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
huge
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
with
a
careful
pour
the
head
was
still
bigger
than
the
beer
smells
very
yeasty
with
grassy
hops
nice
bitterness
in
the
taste
with
the
belgian
style
yeast
has
some
spicy
sweetness
to
it
too
that
makes
sense
right
great
carbonation
level
and
delicious
d
this
is
an
excellent
saison
and
will
definitely
be
in
my
cellar
from
now
on
finished
the
bomber
over
a
couple
of
hours
and
enjoyed
this
one
to
the
last
sip
d
more
drinkable
than
most
saisons
as
rich
but
not
as
filling
as
most
saisons
typically
one
or
two
saisons
is
the
most
you
can
drink
i
could
probably
drink
the
full
4
pack
of
these
this
is
a
really
solid
brew
best
saison
ive
had
and
that
says
something
because
im
a
big
fan
of
saisons
even
in
my
young
days
of
beer
drinking
stellar
as
ever
and
another
fantastic
release
from
ommegang
one
of
my
5
favorites
breweries
in
the
country
will
be
getting
this
again
overall
a
great
warm
weather
beer
and
a
nice
way
for
someone
who
hasnt
traditionally
been
a
fan
of
the
style
to
jump
in
ok
its
not
a
real
belgian
in
the
same
way
a
padron
anniversario
1964
isnt
a
real
cuban
but
in
the
end
do
you
really
care
this
a
great
offering
no
matter
where
its
brewed
medium
body
with
moderately
high
carbonation
maybe
a
tad
drying
on
thge
tongue
and
has
an
evident
warming
characteristic
overall
a
refreshing
beer
with
some
nice
complexity
not
something
i
would
usually
drink
but
made
for
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
overall
this
is
a
solid
solid
beer
i
love
saisons
and
this
did
not
disappoint
that
said
i
still
give
my
edge
overall
to
saison
dupont
as
i
feel
they
are
a
bit
more
clean
overall
in
the
smell
and
taste
especially
i
would
have
liked
the
warmness
of
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
more
subtle
in
the
end
still
loved
it
and
would
enjoy
again
and
again
d
easy
to
drink
and
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
i
got
a
little
bit
of
the
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
but
it
wasnt
very
noticeable
a
little
high
to
be
sessionable
but
it
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
during
the
summer
even
at
the
higher
abv
d
i
could
slam
these
until
i
pass
out
delicious
extremely
happy
with
how
this
turned
out
at
9
494
pk
its
not
a
steal
but
well
worth
it
d
a
wonderful
saison
granted
this
is
not
a
true
belgain
but
its
one
of
the
best
americanmade
of
the
style
one
of
my
most
favorite
summer
beers
to
enjoy
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
of
ommegangs
best
offerings
in
my
opinion
the
feel
and
drinkability
are
amazing
like
freshlysqueezed
orange
juice
hard
as
in
cider
but
not
entirely
soft
in
the
finish
slowly
warms
you
up
and
mellows
you
out
wonderful
d
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
this
beer
is
gonna
make
me
reevaluate
the
style
d
this
beer
is
perfect
for
drinking
while
cooking
on
the
grill
in
the
middle
of
summer
after
mowing
the
lawn
and
playing
fetch
with
the
dog
its
perfect
for
drinking
on
a
cool
night
the
alcohol
content
is
low
enough
to
make
this
a
beer
you
can
sip
all
night
and
everything
about
it
is
enough
to
make
you
want
to
sip
it
all
night
outstanding
very
drinkable
a
must
have
i
laughed
i
cried
it
was
better
than
cats
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
deserves
all
the
high
praise
it
receives
looks
great
and
exceptionally
tasty
a
great
saison
ale
d
goes
down
like
a
glass
of
lemonade
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
drinks
way
too
easy
for
a
7
7
brew
maybe
its
the
30
degree
weather
in
daytona
either
way
hennepin
is
a
satisfying
belgianstyle
ale
worth
a
shot
drinkability
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
but
i
probably
could
drink
this
beer
all
year
long
well
constructed
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
i
drink
it
regularly
interesting
flavors
and
moderate
alcohol
level
does
the
trick
for
me
never
have
a
problem
finishing
a
750
ml
bottle
d7
7
so
not
a
session
beer
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
just
perfect
anytime
of
year
i
could
also
see
it
as
a
great
food
pairing
dm
good
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
very
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
a
very
good
beer
m
highly
carbonated
somewhat
thin
body
very
refreshing
with
a
clear
and
crisp
flavor
and
feel
d
all
i
can
say
is
i
could
drink
quit
a
few
of
these
cause
belgian
style
beers
is
my
2nd
favorite
type
of
beer
cheers
to
all
my
new
yorkers
who
brews
such
a
wonderful
belgian
style
beer
good
outing
from
one
of
americas
most
consistent
breweries
very
good
saison
nothing
too
out
there
in
the
flavor
department
just
a
well
flavored
balanced
and
easy
drinking
saison
d
for
an
american
interpretation
of
a
saison
hennepin
is
probably
the
best
and
most
drinkable
of
any
i
have
tried
to
this
day
an
excellent
beer
and
a
benchmark
of
the
style
drinkability
complex
and
refreshing
one
of
the
ultimate
summer
beers
d
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
bit
more
in
the
bottle
but
this
was
great
on
a
warm
spring
day
it
was
made
for
it
with
crisp
full
flavor
and
i
was
sincerely
glad
i
got
to
try
it
again
on
tap
flavors
are
dominated
by
citrus
sweet
and
sour
however
my
first
reaction
was
something
distinctly
caribbean
for
me
this
can
typically
mean
spiced
rum
or
coconuts
but
after
a
bit
more
exploration
i
realized
it
was
a
very
noticable
plantain
flavor
keeping
with
the
caribbean
theme
which
is
very
subtlethere
is
a
creaminess
which
combined
with
the
pineapple
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
classic
pina
colada
despite
the
appearance
of
a
creamy
texture
there
is
a
champagnelike
sharpness
which
makes
this
saison
extremely
dry
and
refreshing
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
i
would
certainly
have
another
and
will
make
a
point
to
seek
this
out
when
it
is
as
hot
as
the
devils
oven
in
the
middle
of
the
michigan
summer
this
beer
makes
me
excited
to
try
many
more
saisons
body
is
light
and
bubbly
it
works
well
for
the
style
this
beer
couldnt
be
any
more
drinkable
fantastic
this
is
my
first
from
brewery
ommegang
they
clearly
know
their
stuff
and
i
look
forward
to
other
items
from
their
portfolio
but
i
dont
think
ill
get
this
one
again
no
complaints
here
this
is
very
very
drinkable
i
enjoy
the
refreshing
aspect
of
this
beer
it
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
on
the
porch
during
a
75
degree
day
in
spring
d
a
great
one
to
drink
when
drinking
more
than
one
on
the
hot
dry
days
of
summer
a
true
outdoorsman
d
the
alcohol
isnt
hidden
as
well
as
i
anticipated
and
the
sheer
complexity
of
this
beer
makes
it
almost
a
chore
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
chore
but
enough
work
that
i
think
one
bottle
will
tide
me
over
for
a
while
d
good
makes
an
excellent
pairing
with
food
light
enough
to
not
clash
with
the
food
but
crisp
enough
to
clean
the
palate
overall
theres
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
except
how
well
all
the
flavors
complement
each
other
a
quintessential
saison
done
by
a
great
us
brewery
well
worth
a
shot
final
words
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
for
adventurous
beer
drinkers
definitely
worth
having
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
the
cellar
at
all
times
very
nice
beer
d
really
good
drinkability
is
great
normally
i
would
only
give
a
5
to
a
hopbomb
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
gallon
of
this
and
feel
great
impressions
not
bad
pretty
interesting
lowbrow
tasting
brew
there
is
some
interesting
funkiness
in
the
taste
of
this
beer
its
pretty
bold
though
so
some
people
may
dislike
it
fans
of
ipas
should
try
this
d
23
of
these
is
nice
its
as
close
to
a
light
ipa
i
could
consider
d
the
ale
nails
every
aspect
sweet
and
dry
sharp
but
lush
its
been
my
favorite
for
years
and
this
growler
is
no
exception
given
the
high
reviews
that
i
have
seen
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
much
more
flavorful
than
it
ended
up
being
although
it
is
a
nice
beer
it
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
when
it
came
to
flavor
notes
good
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
level
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
is
so
well
liked
drinkability
the
smooth
transitions
and
robust
elegance
of
hennepin
make
it
a
drinkable
model
brew
for
the
category
this
is
truly
a
great
belgianstyle
ale
brewed
right
here
in
the
northeast
excellent
value
as
well
drinkability
very
good
there
is
a
lot
happening
in
this
fine
saison
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
one
so
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
goes
down
well
definitely
true
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
dry
as
i
can
imagine
with
ample
carbonation
this
was
a
great
refreshing
beer
for
outside
on
a
hot
day
not
sessionable
but
certainly
quaffable
d
this
goes
down
smoothly
and
easy
to
drink
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
coast
through
a
bottle
quick
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
given
the
alcohol
content
such
an
easily
appreciated
beer
at
a
great
price
and
that
can
be
offered
to
those
not
intheknow
a
lovely
beer
that
i
far
too
often
overlook
despite
having
offered
it
many
a
time
during
a
weekly
beer
tasting
at
the
liquor
establishment
where
i
was
previously
employed
always
a
treatnever
to
be
disappointed
by
this
belgianstyled
beauty
ommegang
is
always
on
point
d
nonsession
beer
for
sure
it
hides
its
somewhat
high
abv
all
day
long
easily
enjoyed
during
many
different
seasons
of
the
year
and
goes
great
with
spicy
food
farmhouse
saisons
are
becoming
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
great
job
ommegang
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
here
not
very
noticeable
at
all
until
the
end
overall
goes
down
easy
and
definitely
a
quality
saison
in
my
book
excellent
saison
excellent
beer
one
that
i
should
have
more
of
d
i
type
pretty
fast
to
give
you
an
idea
of
things
and
while
typing
this
review
ive
killed
off
the
entire
beer
except
for
a
mouthful
without
really
realizing
it
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
very
high
drinkability
obviously
well
until
the
near
8
abv
sneaks
up
on
me
cheers
overall
impression
this
is
a
beer
ive
had
several
times
but
i
have
never
been
overly
impressed
with
it
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
can
think
of
many
others
id
rather
drink
in
its
place
thats
just
my
opinion
if
you
look
elsewhere
youll
see
that
this
beer
is
very
highly
rated
judge
for
yourself
drinkability
again
very
much
like
a
light
beer
while
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
i
was
let
down
by
my
expectations
come
on
ommegange
you
can
do
better
the
7
7
abv
is
what
prevents
this
beer
from
being
a
4
or
even
4
5
in
drinkability
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
hard
of
the
wallet
but
im
a
lightweight
and
i
always
will
be
so
drinking
too
much
of
a
7
7
beer
is
just
out
of
the
question
for
me
d
i
love
this
beer
i
need
to
go
buy
more
as
summer
approaches
i
can
see
myself
sitting
out
on
my
deck
on
a
cool
mn
summer
night
drinking
a
four
pack
of
this
lovely
brew
i
will
be
purchasing
more
flavorful
and
easily
enjoyable
it
retains
its
character
well
7
7
abv
the
perfect
number
d
drinks
very
nicely
refreshing
alcohol
nicely
hidden
very
easy
to
consume
and
improves
quite
well
with
warmth
so
take
your
time
and
espouse
your
views
with
leisure
great
smell
banana
citrus
bready
unbelievable
taste
just
enough
funksour
to
give
it
an
amazing
character
ive
never
had
a
beer
quite
like
this
cant
wait
to
have
another
classic
saison
easily
the
best
widely
available
domestic
version
of
the
style
pours
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
smells
very
fresh
and
inviting
tastes
even
better
fruity
notes
and
soft
yeast
and
grain
flavor
super
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
cannot
get
enough
of
this
stuff
a
must
drink
notes
outstanding
ommengang
offering
great
saison
and
a
remarkable
reinterpretation
of
the
belgian
style
a
grainy
malt
dominates
the
palate
the
high
alcohol
lvel
is
masked
very
well
the
yeast
leaves
a
funky
taste
behind
tart
citric
finish
thats
not
too
puckering
great
for
the
style
very
solid
take
on
the
style
thats
not
too
flashy
pays
homage
to
the
originals
but
has
a
distinctly
american
voice
when
you
see
this
one
for
under
7
consider
it
a
steal
drinkability
as
i
said
simply
delicious
ive
never
had
hennepin
before
but
this
might
have
to
become
a
staple
in
my
household
d
delicate
but
with
a
certain
raw
edge
and
pleasingly
complex
like
a
belgian
thoroughbred
through
and
through
but
its
not
id
say
this
one
raises
the
bar
even
for
belgian
brewers
a
fine
example
of
the
style
notes
i
have
long
regarded
this
beer
very
highly
while
it
isnt
the
super
beer
that
i
remember
it
being
the
first
time
i
ever
tried
it
because
it
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beers
i
would
definitely
say
it
is
an
extremely
superior
beer
it
has
great
flavor
and
is
just
so
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
hennepin
is
a
nice
crisp
farmhouse
ale
that
is
refreshing
in
summer
and
perfect
with
a
rich
meal
in
colder
weather
its
a
great
yearround
allpurpose
ale
overall
very
easy
to
drink
an
outstanding
beer
that
will
earn
a
permanent
home
in
the
mancave
beer
fridge
drinkability
easy
the
beer
was

but
with
the
complexity
of
a
good
dubble
get
it
while
you
can
as
new
owners
of
howes
cavern
no
longer
let
ommegang
age
beer
there
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
have
more
than
one
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
little
heavy
on
the
price
where
i
get
it
but
i
definantly
see
myself
partaking
again
in
the
future
this
is
a
great
beer
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
it
has
almost
an
elegant
quality
to
it
drinkability
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
if
this
beer
could
contain
alcohol
or
could
be
exactly
the
same
and
contain
no
alcohol
i
would
opt
for
later
because
if
i
could
i
would
drink
this
all
day
every
day
absolutely
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
had
would
love
to
try
this
again
on
tapwill
def
enjoy
again
at
7
99bottle
mirrors
the
quality
of
much
more
expensive
belgium
styles
at
half
the
price
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
alcohol
was
pleasantly
masked
by
all
that
was
going
on
with
the
flavors
has
to
be
the
best
saison
that
i
have
tried
d
an
excellent
brew
from
ommegang
full
of
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
d
i
have
had
this
before
and
had
it
again
a
great
beer
by
ommegang
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
pale
gold
appearance
with
a
frothy
head
that
lasted
for
awhile
during
my
drinking
session
the
aromas
were
quite
good
with
a
hint
of
spice
to
the
dominant
grassy
tones
the
taste
is
really
good
a
perfect
balance
of
sour
tastes
with
fruit
flavors
like
lemons
peaches
oranges
all
of
it
mixed
with
a
yeasty
earthy
flavors
mouthfeel
was
decent
though
the
drink
lacked
a
good
punch
and
was
a
little
too
light
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
like
this
beer
ok
but
i
think
foret
is
far
superior
sampled
on
january
19
2010
the
cork
popped
and
flew
across
the
room
emitting
a
nice
bit
of
carbonated
mist
from
the
bottle
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
and
quite
cloudy
with
excitable
effervescence
the
fizzy
white
head
diminishes
after
a
few
moments
the
aroma
is
a
nice
pleasing
balance
of
wheat
banana
yeast
and
clove
there
is
a
nice
creamy
bold
mouthfeel
the
taste
echoes
the
aroma
with
an
additional
breadiness
and
a
dry
hop
ending
ommegang
really
understands
the
belgian
style
brtewing
process
and
they
emulate
it
well
drinkability
is
good
pretty
much
classic
saison
crisp
refreshing
but
with
a
huge
massively
complex
flavor
textbook
excellent
i
would
write
more
but
its
a
shame
to
be
tapping
on
my
phone
while
this
beer
sits
in
front
of
me
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
drink
one
of
your
own
cheers
drinkability
if
i
didnt
know
what
brewery
this
was
from
i
would
say
this
was
brewed
in
belgium
absolutely
true
to
the
style
and
very
good
overall
value
i
paid
three
bucks
for
a
12
oz
bottle
not
bad
for
what
is
obviously
a
highquality
ale
i
cant
say
that
this
style
is
my
favorite
beer
so
i
am
always
a
little
reticent
about
what
im
going
to
taste
however
this
beer
keeps
the
citrus
and
spice
components
very
well
balanced
some
sweetness
on
the
front
palate
and
some
hoppiness
on
the
finish
gives
the
beer
a
crisp
appeal
good
level
of
carbonation
surprising
given
how
quickly
the
head
dissipated
again
this
is
well
balanced
and
adds
to
this
beers
drinkability
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
beer
and
others
from
this
producer
very
impresive
beer
as
expected
from
the
duvel
family
of
ales
this
was
the
beer
that
started
my
love
of
saisons
the
flavor
created
by
the
high
abv
is
complex
while
avoiding
the
alcoholsolvent
flavors
drinkability
though
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
would
gladly
have
this
one
again
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
when
served
chilled
i
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
flavor
much
and
then
it
warmed
up
and
was
very
noticeable
in
the
finish
if
i
had
a
6
pack
of
12
oz
bottles
they
would
definitely
be
finished
in
one
setting
good
stuff
d
just
seems
too
tart
for
me
to
handle
drinking
a
lot
of
this
almost
puckering
before
trying
hennepin
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
since
then
ive
really
enjoyed
saisons
id
say
this
is
still
up
there
on
my
top
5
saison
list
d
i
finished
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
while
making
the
baked
ziti
for
dinner
i
took
the
last
sip
with
dinner
next
time
i
think
ill
wait
to
crack
this
open
until
after
dinner
due
to
the
sugary
sweetness
d
high
it
was
shared
with
friends
but
one
can
easily
finish
off
a
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
two
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
leaving
patchy
lacing
aromas
of
lemon
yeast
spice
and
some
grass
vanilla
melon
spicescorriander
sweet
orange
and
floral
hop
flavors
blend
nicely
high
carbonation
medium
body
with
a
dry
spicy
finish
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
or
enjoy
on
its
own
d
this
beer
is
pretty
well
done
it
is
light
on
the
body
perfect
drink
in
the
hot
weather
of
the
south
let
me
add
that
i
have
the
big
bottle
often
and
this
was
the
first
12
oz
bottle
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
seems
like
a
good
introduction
for
me
to
the
saison
style
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
others
as
this
one
was
pretty
tasty
and
a
good
change
from
the
usual
belgians
available
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
hazy
golden
color
with
big
bubbled
head
the
taste
took
me
by
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
hard
cider
like
taste
to
it
great
aroma
of
ginger
and
citrus
very
bubbly
in
the
mouth
very
crisp
and
clean
taste
would
have
probably
been
even
better
on
a
hot
day
d
on
the
low
end
of
the
drinkability
scale
for
a
saison
but
pleasant
enough
to
have
a
few
happy
christmas
to
allcheers
d
like
all
of
ommegangs
beers
this
is
extremely
delicious
and
drinkable
d
highly
drinkable
fantastic
brew
d
this
beer
just
gets
better
as
it
warms
im
still
fairly
new
to
farmhouse
ales
but
i
can
definitely
see
making
this
a
regular
stop
on
my
rotation
especially
in
the
summer
d
good
drinkability
the
flavors
are
strong
and
there
is
alot
of
carbonation
and
that
could
limit
the
drinkability
but
the
flavors
are
great
and
do
not
get
old
and
you
can
barely
detect
the
alcohol
pours
a
fairly
clear
yelloworange
with
a
huge
crackled
head
that
is
slow
to
dissolve
and
never
fully
does
strong
spices
dominate
the
aroma
belgian
yeast
clove
some
floweryspicy
hops
flavor
is
sweet
upfront
and
followed
by
more
driven
spices
and
an
alcohol
warmth
its
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
prickly
carbonation
this
has
a
great
wealth
of
spices
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
that
some
people
might
find
a
little
overpowering
but
i
thought
it
worked
nicely
with
the
slight
grassyspicy
hops
pours
the
expected
light
yelloworange
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
that
dissolves
slowly
and
allows
for
nice
lacing
aromas
and
flavors
are
huge
big
fruitiness
some
bread
cookies
farmhouse
funk
shows
up
as
well
its
a
huge
flavor
and
absolutely
fantastic
body
and
carbonation
are
busy
and
good
for
the
style
would
definitely
have
it
again
and
most
likely
will
dits
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
think
a
great
version
of
the
style
random
i
dont
remember
the
banana
from
the
bottle
definitely
more
delicious
as
it
warms
drink
is
great
a
nice
offering
of
alcohol
but
never
really
stands
out
easy
drinking
and
easily
enjoyable
a
must
have
in
my
book
d
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
a
limited
session
for
some
reason
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
drinking
this
in
the
bottle
versus
pouring
into
a
glass
i
had
drank
this
once
just
in
bottle
form
and
for
whatever
reason
pouring
it
into
the
glass
was
so
much
better
highly
recommended
overall
impressions
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
that
i
cannot
quite
put
into
words
this
was
one
of
my
early
reviews
very
refreshing
belgian
that
is
not
too
heavy
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
i
could
and
would
drink
this
beer
everyday
d
highly
drinkable
quite
impressed
with
the
craftmanship
of
this
beer
saison
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
ommegang
does
a
great
job
with
this
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
from
belgium
in
a
blind
tasting
pours
out
like
lemonade
hazy
yellow
that
looks
very
dilute
has
an
explosive
head
that
goes
up
to
about
three
fingers
and
dies
down
to
about
one
and
retains
at
that
point
very
well
the
color
is
not
that
attractive
but
i
think
the
haziness
is
due
to
me
pouring
in
some
of
the
sediment
other
than
that
the
appearance
is
pretty
strong
smell
is
a
mix
of
belgian
yeast
and
malts
some
fruit
apples
bananas
and
a
bit
of
sour
the
overall
strength
of
the
smell
is
a
bit
weak
and
i
start
to
pick
up
more
and
more
alcohol
as
i
drink
it
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
smell
belgian
yeast
and
malty
flavors
fruits
apples
bananas
alcohol
and
some
sour
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
it
is
stronger
than
the
nose
and
pretty
much
just
a
solid
belgian
flavor
it
eventually
dies
down
to
a
very
dry
almost
rye
like
taste
with
alcohol
the
loss
of
flavor
is
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
pretty
suitable
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
body
is
pretty
light
but
a
bit
creamy
not
really
watery
at
all
this
beer
is
pretty
warm
for
7
5
drinkability
would
be
better
if
the
alcohol
did
not
take
over
and
the
flavors
did
not
die
the
price
is
not
that
great
for
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
maybe
ill
try
it
again
after
i
have
some
more
saisons
pours
a
yellowish
oragnish
grapefruit
like
color
with
a
pillowy
head
that
gives
way
to
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
backbone
with
some
citrus
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
bubbly
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
to
turn
you
off
but
it
is
a
slighty
funky
taste
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
tried
this
beer
out
of
a
22
oz
bottle
from
oasis
in
spartanburg
the
color
is
kind
of
hard
to
describe
sort
of
a
hazy
yellow
with
huge
bright
white
head
that
fades
some
smell
is
sugar
and
alcohol
with
little
hops
taste
is
sweet
and
a
bit
dry
this
one
is
really
bubbly
but
a
very
easy
drink
espically
at
7
7
abv
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
can
see
why
its
one
of
the
best
saisons
out
there
this
beer
is
just
right
for
the
style
its
not
too
strong
to
take
away
from
drinkability
but
its
still
very
flavorful
and
complex
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
without
getting
tired
of
it
drinkability
i
say
f
bud
light
this
wins
for
drinkability
perfect
carbonation
mouthfeel
and
texture
not
overwelming
at
all
yet
very
interesting
and
complex
a
must
if
you
havent
had
anything
from
ommegang
purchase
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
poured
into
a
snifter
this
beer
shows
a
bright
yellow
body
with
a
thick
puffy
white
head
aroma
is
esters
from
the
belgian
yeast
most
notably
lemon
zest
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
effervescent
with
a
winelike
yeast
flavor
very
good
drinkability
medium
body
with
a
lot
of
sharp
carbonation
to
it
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
overall
is
much
better
than
any
fresh
hennepin
ive
had
d
very
good
balanced
drinkable
saisonone
of
the
best
of
its
style
taste
the
beer
changes
flavor
throughout
the
sip
it
starts
with
a
biting
carbonation
that
is
taken
over
by
the
tartness
of
the
yeast
a
slight
sweet
flavor
pear
and
orange
follows
that
is
taken
by
a
hop
and
malt
bite
the
taste
dries
on
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
sweet
husky
malt
behind
with
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
at
ommefest
amazing
golden
color
with
light
hints
of
softer
fruits
spices
and
zest
amazingly
crisp
and
dry
much
how
i
love
saisons
always
a
winner
ive
had
the
original
from
belgium
recently
that
is
about
2
years
old
and
can
say
that
it
is
holing
up
very
well
i
was
surprised
how
well
it
was
doing
censidering
the
time
difference
but
ommegang
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
drinkabilityoverall
this
beer
seems
to
get
better
as
you
drink
it
i
guess
the
tastes
come
out
more
as
it
warms
also
this
beer
has
one
of
the
greatest
differences
between
pre
and
postagitation
taste
that
ive
ever
had
certainly
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
particularly
with
certain
types
of
food
still
i
prefer
the
rare
vos
from
ommegang
carbonation
is
high
not
sure
if
that
is
appropriate
or
not
but
it
seems
to
go
well
mouthfeel
is
dry
leaving
you
wanting
another
sip
overall
this
to
me
is
just
a
little
more
pricey
sessional
nothing
special
pours
a
slightly
hazy
very
pale
golden
with
bluishgreen
highlights
a
nice
rocky
pale
white
head
sits
atop
the
beer
smell
is
estery
fruity
and
smells
of
fresh
grain
taste
is
light
and
fruity
up
front
hints
of
bananas
and
cloves
very
little
bitterness
which
is
to
style
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
high
carbonation
though
drinkability
is
very
good
delicate
flavors
make
this
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
odd
bitterness
to
it
its
like
orange
peels
or
something
the
flavors
are
complicated
fruity
sour
harsh
and
finished
by
the
bitterness
drinkability
moderate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
unfortunately
d
this
is
what
i
expect
from
a
saison
excellent
balance
of
tartness
floral
and
spicy
hops
havent
experienced
that
before
hope
im
not
misinterpreting
something
and
biscuity
malt
this
beer
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
and
has
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
brewery
ommegang
does
it
again
d
kept
waiting
for
the
catch
but
there
isnt
one
this
is
a
really
good
beer
could
drink
one
every
night
and
not
tire
of
it
for
a
long
time
looking
forward
to
picking
up
a
sixer
and
letting
them
age
for
612
months
just
poured
this
from
one
of
the
750ml
bottles
it
has
a
nice
and
soft
golden
yellow
color
with
a
strong
head
that
slowly
dissipates
as
it
sits
in
the
glass
upon
the
first
sniff
i
get
a
slight
slight
malt
fragrance
accompanied
with
citrus
when
drinking
while
smelling
there
is
a
strong
hoppy
aroma
as
well
as
a
nice
hoppy
and
carbonated
dance
on
the
tongue
as
it
goes
down
the
hatch
i
get
a
crisp
burst
of
citrus
followed
by
a
final
goodbye
of
hoppiness
the
taste
left
in
the
mouth
is
a
battle
between
hops
and
citrus
with
the
victor
eventually
being
the
citrus
indeed
it
should
be
served
a
tad
bit
out
of
the
fridge
as
i
think
it
helps
battle
the
strong
carbonation
but
my
goodness
is
this
beer
smooth
delicious
and
oh
so
good
to
the
last
drop
hennepin
we
will
be
seeing
each
other
soon
drinkability
very
tasty
by
far
my
favorite
in
the
style
that
i
have
tried
so
far
i
like
the
hay
taste
without
the
big
bitter
taste
i
will
be
having
this
again
tastes
are
consistent
with
a
couple
different
fruits
i
pick
up
a
little
grapefruit
specifically
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
d
my
first
saison
and
i
love
it
its
just
perfect
to
sip
on
but
i
really
like
pairing
it
with
food
i
tried
it
with
some
humbolt
fog
an
aged
goatsmilk
cheese
and
it
was
just
superb
the
taste
starts
slightly
shrp
and
acidic
but
this
quickly
settles
down
into
a
lightly
alcoholic
fruitiness
with
herbalpepperyspicey
bite
yeasty
dough
the
herb
has
a
juniper
quality
along
with
otherwise
leafiness
and
grassiness
there
is
a
light
earthy
hint
throughout
it
has
light
sweetness
balanced
by
the
bitterspiceyacidic
bite
so
ends
up
rather
dry
but
not
too
dry
its
quite
drinkable
and
though
a
bit
thin
has
some
complexity
and
good
balance
while
the
character
holds
up
well
d
this
is
the
ultimate
belgian
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
this
was
really
good
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
will
pick
up
more
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
drinkable
ale
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
american
interpretations
of
a
belgian
style
and
id
also
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
regardless
of
origin
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
an
affordable
crisp
tasty
pale
ale
with
more
character
than
the
typical
golden
ale
d
refreshing
with
higher
abv
this
is
a
drinkable
farmhouse
ale
its
not
as
blatantly
musty
earthy
as
i
expect
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in
its
nice
fruit
character
from
a
bomber
or
750ml
bottle
cant
remember
this
saison
poured
a
light
yellow
with
enormous
lacing
a
fresh
biscuity
aroma
hits
the
nose
on
this
light
yet
potent
saison
the
typical
belg
flavor
profile
comes
out
with
clove
and
banana
this
reminds
me
less
of
a
saison
than
of
a
basic
ale
a
decent
drink
though
i
prefer
some
other
saisons
over
this
one
d
drinkable
to
me
at
least
as
a
sipper
this
was
my
third
beer
of
the
festival
and
noticed
it
took
me
much
longer
to
get
through
this
beer
than
the
other
two
ill
likely
try
this
again
in
a
more
standard
sitting
and
see
how
that
goes
great
belgian
style
saison
nice
big
foamy
fluffy
head
that
leaves
good
lace
white
grape
juice
lots
of
lemon
peel
and
golden
apples
with
powerful
coriander
to
back
it
up
very
tasty
and
drinkable
at
8
fine
example
and
a
great
bottle
to
put
back
on
a
hot
day
appreciated
the
spice
very
little
sediment
in
this
750ml
poured
this
dirt
and
mold
covered
bottle
into
a
hennepin
glass
this
is
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
it
non
cave
aged
brethren
its
quite
a
bit
more
subtle
and
all
of
the
flavors
kind
of
meld
together
in
a
nice
sequence
of
mouthfeel
and
flavor
at
the
same
time
it
has
wonderful
looking
floaties
that
look
great
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
more
understated
mouthfeel
than
the
non
cave
aged
version
and
is
much
more
pleasant
to
drink
i
may
go
to
the
brewery
tomorrow
to
get
some
adoration
ale
maybe
ill
pick
a
few
more
of
these
up
while
im
there
light
to
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
i
didnt
drink
it
as
quickly
as
i
have
some
other
brews
but
i
think
you
could
sip
this
stuff
all
night
very
nice
well
rounded
brew
drinkability
relatively
drinkable
for
an
almost
8
saison
i
can
taste
just
a
bit
of
the
alcohol
coming
through
the
closer
to
room
temperature
this
gets
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
have
this
find
friday
evening
d
as
above
so
it
is
below
look
out
these
would
fly
away
almost
too
universal
in
its
appeal
huge
crowd
pleaser
im
not
that
familiar
with
this
style
and
dont
have
a
lot
of
other
saisons
to
compare
to
but
as
a
beer
its
actually
very
good
its
almost
a
little
like
a
wheat
beer
without
the
banana
aroma
color
is
a
light
copper
carbonation
is
reasonable
not
too
high
flavor
very
light
for
the
alcohol
content
and
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
great
aroma
is
quite
unique
without
being
too
overwhelming
d
had
the
whole
750
and
could
ask
for
more
maybe
because
im
intrigued
by
this
beer
or
maybe
im
just
enjoying
the
buzz
finishes
bonedry
and
crisp
it
appears
that
much
of
fruit
and
spice
is
coming
from
actual
spices
as
opposed
to
the
yeast
a
saison
that
has
remained
true
to
the
history
of
this
style
refreshing
nourishing
and
perfect
for
warm
weather
drinking
smells
a
bit
fruity
with
a
little
spiciness
delicious
tingles
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkability
is
amazing
this
shit
is
awesome
one
of
my
first
saisonfarmhouse
styles
and
i
must
say
amazing
please
drink
one
i
could
have
reviewed
this
beer
so
much
better
but
im
a
little
too
buzzed
drinkability
is
of
a
dangerous
caliber
delicious
easy
to
drink
alcohol
burn
mia
warning
flags
are
up
on
this
one
it
would
not
be
problematic
to
finish
this
bomber
before
the
end
ummmm
that
was
good
of
this
sentence
drinkability
pretty
good
its
pretty
balanced
and
drinks
light
for
having
almost
8
abv
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
decent
give
this
beer
a
try
it
wont
disappoint
overall
big
bold
flavor
for
a
domestic
belgian
these
guys
arent
playing
around
with
the
style
the
extreme
carbonation
and
the
tremendously
pale
hue
sets
it
apart
from
the
expected
brew
but
this
one
has
started
its
own
trek
with
a
backpack
full
of
the
traditional
guidelines
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
aroma
was
initially
a
lagerish
skunk
but
later
i
could
pick
up
a
dark
fruit
smell
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
little
sour
aftertaste
the
feel
was
light
bodied
crisp
and
clean
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
overall
hennepin
was
much
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
than
it
was
a
saison
and
a
pretty
good
bspa
too
in
short
i
have
tried
a
couple
saisonsfarmhouse
ales
and
the
hennepin
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
ommegang
has
done
an
excellent
job
in
creating
a
world
class
saison
this
is
what
i
want
a
farmhouse
ale
to
taste
like
thank
you
ommegang
for
the
delicious
saison
next
time
ill
get
the
bigger
bottle
d
delicious
smooth
complex
flavor
hidden
abvs
d
the
beer
goes
down
easy
highly
drinkable
even
for
a
7
beer
this
was
my
first
time
having
this
on
tap
i
had
a
bottle
a
few
years
ago
that
i
remember
being
funkier
time
to
revisit
a
bottle
of
this
very
drinkable
an
old
favorite
that
i
was
happy
to
visit
on
tap
accept
for
the
odd
metallic
taste
drinkability
balanced
through
and
through
a
with
the
relatively
low
abv
it
certainly
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
well
masked
alcohol
im
personally
not
a
big
saison
fan
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
above
all
it
is
exceedingly
tasty
and
drinkable
i
use
it
as
the
standard
to
measure
other
saison
ales
against
in
my
opinion
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
buying
this
beer
the
taste
in
the
mouth
is
almost
the
same
as
the
flavor
not
as
spicy
as
it
tastes
though
pretty
uneventful
in
whole
but
very
well
balanced
mild
and
a
perfect
hot
day
beer
d
mabye
the
most
drinkable
saison
ive
had
extremely
well
balanced
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
d
goes
down
very
smooth
what
glass
is
already
empty
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
sure
d
quite
refreshing
and
nice
for
warm
weather
overall
this
is
a
brilliant
beer
it
delivers
exactly
what
it
promises
keep
up
the
good
work
at
ommegang
drinkability
is
decent
i
could
easily
have
another
the
somewhat
high
abv
is
not
detectable
an
unusual
beer
but
one
i
really
liked
an
amazing
saison
lots
of
flavor
not
sure
if
its
from
the
malt
or
the
added
ingredients
ginger
and
orange
i
think
not
super
dry
but
being
an
american
interpretation
one
of
the
best
for
its
style
overall
impression
another
solid
beer
from
ommegang
im
continually
impressed
at
the
amount
of
belgian
beers
they
make
that
are
great
representations
of
the
style
if
youre
new
to
belgian
beerssaisons
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
and
can
serve
as
a
good
comparison
for
other
beers
of
the
style
it
may
not
be
the
best
saison
but
it
is
solid
so
great
lakes
grassroots
ale
bills
itself
as
a
saison
but
i
am
confused
because
that
tasted
like
crap
and
this
tastes
delicious
i
am
glad
that
i
did
not
let
the
grassroots
scare
me
away
from
the
style
entirely
poured
from
a
growler
into
a
pint
glass
small
disappearing
head
with
slow
but
steady
carbonation
sugary
biscuity
sweet
with
a
hint
of
clove
aroma
sweet
and
crisp
with
the
carbonation
makes
it
burst
on
your
tongue
alcohol
extremely
hidden
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
an
instant
favorite
personally
i
love
hennepin
i
would
put
this
against
any
good
chardonnay
or
white
châteauneufdupape
any
day
of
the
week
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
something
that
would
go
great
with
an
expensive
dinner
no
single
flavor
dominates
as
in
some
other
belgian
style
beers
ive
had
had
it
again
seem
about
the
middle
of
the
road
for
the
this
is
an
old
bottle
and
this
is
a
new
bottle
didnt
have
the
expanded
palate
lack
a
lot
of
broadness
hard
on
the
gums
im
over
this
beer
ruining
a
style
i
love
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
enough
to
have
a
few
but
still
packs
a
nice
flavor
tasting
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
fathers
day
2005
my
girls
took
me
on
a
brewery
tour
in
bruges
at
the
straffe
hendrik
brewery
they
were
serving
their
saison
hennepin
has
managed
to
capture
the
essence
of
the
belgium
brewing
style
a
smooth
blend
of
fruit
sour
and
muted
bread
flavors
that
perfectly
mask
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
i
recently
had
one
of
these
while
watching
rick
steves
give
a
hd
tour
of
of
the
grand
place
in
brussels
perfect
verdict
hennepin
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
with
an
enjoy
on
a
peaceful
summer
evening
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
saison
out
there
but
its
still
well
worth
a
try
drinkabilty
ridiculously
drinkable
for
its
abv
maybe
dangerously
so
i
could
easily
drink
several
more
of
these
quite
refreshing
very
good
this
is
the
first
saison
ive
tried
but
i
can
safely
say
ill
be
buying
this
again
and
trying
some
others
overall
while
not
100
to
my
personal
preferences
for
the
style
i
like
mine
funkier
and
a
little
more
dry
i
have
to
admit
this
is
an
excellent
job
by
ommegang
they
somehow
managed
to
take
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
ale
and
craft
something
thats
extremely
approachable
without
dumbing
it
down
one
iota
a
top
class
ale
id
recommend
whether
youre
new
to
the
style
or
a
seasoned
saison
drinker
go
blue
d
delicious
saison
well
balanced
and
interesting
feel
is
great
and
is
deliciously
drinkable
d
a
good
saison
the
alcohol
is
slightly
too
prominent
but
still
its
fairly
well
balanced
with
a
pleasant
composition
of
flavors
and
aromas
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
did
remind
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
than
a
saison
im
looking
for
more
funk
and
more
of
a
refreshing
feel
in
essence
something
more
traditional
that
aside
hennepin
is
a
decent
us
take
on
a
belgian
and
worth
the
price
especially
when
you
get
it
on
superspecial
like
ritzkiss
did
cheers
for
sharing
eric
probably
the
pick
of
the
bunch
last
night
imho
could
easily
drink
this
all
summer
night
long
and
not
feel
lacking
d
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
golden
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
but
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
complex
some
nice
sweet
fruit
notes
some
malt
and
spice
notes
as
well
the
taste
starts
somewhat
sweet
with
the
spice
and
fruit
upfront
followed
by
a
somewhat
tart
taste
finishing
with
a
malty
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
some
alcohol
content
detected
in
the
aftertaste
but
overall
a
silky
beer
with
nice
balance
this
is
a
great
drinker
not
overpowering
flavor
but
lots
of
flavor
is
packed
into
this
beer
definitely
worth
checking
out
drinkability
is
good
very
tasty
and
lightly
boozy
saison
full
of
yeasty
esters
and
fruity
tones
this
brew
is
solid
nicely
proportioned
very
successfull
brew
the
alcohol
hurts
a
bit
but
still
very
well
done
cheers
its
really
a
tough
call
between
this
and
dupont
if
youre
deciding
between
which
saison
to
go
with
though
in
the
end
i
hennepin
the
edge
this
one
is
absolutely
a
delight
to
drink
d
highly
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
but
with
big
flavor
and
alcohol
i
saw
this
staring
me
in
the
face
at
my
local
beer
store
and
had
to
give
a
taste
it
pours
an
amberyellow
partly
cloudy
moderate
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
hints
of
yeast
the
taste
does
not
let
me
down
so
fruity
and
delicious
i
love
the
spice
mix
its
like
a
piece
of
bread
with
cinnamon
butter
spread
on
it
i
found
the
mouth
feel
to
be
pleasing
as
well
not
too
thick
seems
right
for
a
saison
i
think
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
the
abv
might
get
you
but
it
would
be
worth
downing
a
few
bombers
absolutely
delicious
and
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
very
drinkable
very
tasty
and
yet
very
dangerous
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
hennepin
definitely
gives
belgians
a
run
for
their
money
great
value
as
well
d
very
drinkable
and
easily
overdone
be
easy
and
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
nice
for
a
hot
day
but
still
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
be
a
quality
craft
beer
the
mouth
is
very
crisp
and
overlycarbonated
too
spritzy
for
my
liking
this
may
be
a
style
thing
so
my
rating
is
a
bit
higher
than
my
preference
flavor
is
of
pineapple
apples
tart
yeast
and
slight
spicy
finish
this
is
refreshing
and
pretty
good
had
it
with
lunch
and
it
paired
well
not
bad
my
first
of
this
style
i
will
seek
out
more
this
is
a
great
brew
well
made
and
it
can
stand
a
long
side
the
best
saisons
in
the
world
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lightbodied
and
crisp
sort
of
reminiscent
of
a
champagne
but
not
as
bubbly
excellent
drinkability
sippable
throughout
the
night
and
great
to
share
with
a
friend
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
foamy
sticky
white
head
the
aroma
has
bananas
cloves
lemon
and
yeast
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
has
some
sweetness
up
front
and
a
dry
tart
finish
low
to
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
good
drinkability
well
made
overall
i
could
take
or
leave
this
one
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
based
upon
the
advice
of
some
friends
and
of
course
all
the
reviews
and
kudos
here
but
frankly
i
just
dont
get
it
it
is
decent
it
is
solid
and
would
i
take
another
if
someone
poured
it
sure
why
not
but
did
it
blow
me
away
and
would
i
seek
it
out
again
no
and
probably
not
drinkablity
very
drinkable
and
a
reasonable
abv
could
easily
do
a
session
with
this
one
and
i
have
s3everal
times
very
good
american
interpretation
of
a
saison
farmhouse
style
hennepin
is
a
very
drinkable
dry
brew
you
have
to
be
a
fan
of
the
spiceclove
taste
to
love
this
beer
another
delicious
offering
from
the
world
class
brewers
at
ommegang
pours
a
nice
cloudy
gold
with
a
billowy
head
smells
fruity
with
spice
i
had
never
had
a
saison
and
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
reminded
me
of
a
wheat
beer
with
a
touch
of
funk
it
was
interesting
the
aroma
was
the
best
part
of
it
very
refreshing
fruit
smell
light
feel
with
lots
of
carbonation
enjoyed
it
but
the
taste
needed
a
bit
more
crispness
i
really
wanted
just
a
sharpness
to
the
flavor
great
though
d
an
ok
brew
that
wasnt
quite
my
style
has
that
hard
to
find
balance
between
complexity
and
drinkability
good
stuff
4
dangerously
quaffible
at
7
5
acc
to
bottle
the
friendliest
farmhouse
ive
tried
so
far
but
so
light
on
the
funk
and
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
in
an
intrusive
way
as
the
brew
warms
slightly
given
the
seeming
need
to
glurp
it
combined
with
the
high
abv
probably
wont
go
for
this
very
often
d
its
drinkable
the
more
of
it
i
have
the
more
i
like
it
but
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
agian
d
one
of
the
few
american
saisons
that
can
go
toetotoe
with
the
big
boys
recommended
d
lots
of
dynamic
yeast
action
here
i
could
probably
drink
another
bottle
of
this
in
one
sitting
but
i
would
certainly
take
it
slow
this
is
the
kind
of
brew
that
rewards
the
drinker
who
takes
hisher
time
its
pretty
filling
especially
when
compared
to
other
saisons
i
would
pair
this
brew
with
a
creamy
robiola
tre
latti
or
a
bready
yeasty
cows
milk
cheese
like
tomme
crayeuse
d
at
first
i
want
to
chug
it
so
refreshing
good
balance
the
abv
goes
un
noticed
in
the
taste
for
the
most
part
on
a
hot
day
i
could
slam
these
down
this
beer
is
full
of
funk
and
bubble
gum
yeasty
doughy
a
little
too
sour
for
a
saison
definately
farmy
but
it
may
be
better
with
food
not
an
easy
brew
to
drink
alone
unless
you
want
half
3
philosophers
and
half
duvel
in
the
same
glass
sorry
hut
dissapointed
tastes
better
with
food
this
ale
is
a
delight
to
drink
lots
of
great
flavors
without
being
too
much
strikes
a
unique
balance
of
light
crisp
body
with
bold
taste
im
a
big
fan
of
ommegang
and
hennepin
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
honey
malts
grassy
and
lemon
flavors
and
an
earthy
dryness
are
the
signature
of
this
beer
you
can
also
find
banana
and
little
clove
along
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
smell
is
of
spicy
honey
and
grain
this
cloudy
yellow
beer
beer
is
one
of
best
in
style
that
ive
ever
had
its
wonderful
all
around
pleasant
to
look
at
it
smell
and
feel
a
beer
for
your
senses
dsolid
brew
that
really
hits
the
spot
would
definitely
buy
again
this
is
an
excellent
saison
once
again
ommegang
truly
do
give
the
belgians
a
run
for
their
money
i
definitely
want
to
see
what
age
can
do
to
it
does
the
funk
take
over
in
time
a
great
brew
from
ommegang
o
complex
but
not
too
complex
seems
to
have
been
a
great
choice
for
a
refreshing
beer
on
this
hot
day
personally
i
think
that
it
has
more
to
offer
in
the
aroma
than
it
does
in
taste
definitely
a
fun
time
and
not
too
expensive
750ml
for
7
50
the
bottle
will
be
superglued
to
my
wall
shortly
quite
light
and
refreshing
for
a
strong
beer
rendering
ti
eminently
drinkable
anyone
in
upstate
ny
should
make
a
point
to
visit
the
ommegang
brewery
wonderful
people
scenery
and
delicious
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
prominent
head
that
faded
to
a
thick
film
with
persistent
lacing
smells
spicy
bready
sweet
piny
sticky
musty
earthy
taste
is
thinner
than
aroma
the
spices
come
through
as
do
the
hoppy
tones
and
some
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
unsubstantial
which
leads
to
good
drinkability
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
just
now
a
beautiful
2
finger
head
that
slowly
falls
leaving
perfect
lacing
smell
is
of
grass
and
earth
with
some
light
citrus
notes
taste
is
unreal
so
wonderful
and
crisp
and
so
many
complexities
there
is
a
ton
of
earthy
citrus
and
funky
things
going
on
with
this
one
i
cant
imagine
a
much
better
saison
than
this
example
and
its
from
ny
wow
this
is
so
almost
perfect
in
every
way
it
hides
the
7
7
abv
so
well
and
dare
i
say
this
may
be
a
session
beer
another
great
job
from
ommegang
crisp
funky
earthy
perfect
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
banana
and
cloves
dominate
upfront
with
some
lemon
and
coriander
definitely
taste
the
yeast
and
a
little
sweetness
nice
crispness
from
all
that
carbonation
but
not
overloaded
surprised
by
the
abv
because
it
drinks
pretty
smooth
without
too
much
of
an
alcohol
bite
perfect
for
predinner
or
a
day
out
in
the
sun
in
my
opinion
close
runnerup
to
saison
dupont
for
best
in
style
i
love
this
beer
overall
really
good
drinkability
great
representation
of
the
style
nice
fruity
and
spicy
characteristics
nothing
is
overpowering
and
all
of
the
flavors
work
well
together
i
love
saisons
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
hard
do
beet
an
all
around
great
beer
i
love
to
have
this
brew
threw
out
the
summer
and
i
usually
do
it
is
a
great
picnic
brew
as
well
o
not
too
complex
but
very
refreshing
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
also
extra
credit
for
the
historical
namesake
saisons
were
traditionally
made
for
harvesting
farmhands
in
rural
belgiumthey
were
refreshing
and
light
3
5
abv
ommegang
has
unfortunately
americanised
this
saison
and
i
feel
its
lost
something
of
its
authenticity
in
the
process
prost
mouthfeel
is
soft
chalky
chewy
one
of
the
best
from
america
great
to
get
it
in
4
packs
d
this
beer
certainly
goes
down
easily
enough
im
starting
to
realize
that
saison
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
but
i
still
feel
hennepin
is
a
great
example
of
one
this
has
a
lot
more
in
common
with
a
belgian
blonde
or
tripel
than
a
saison
lots
of
banana
not
enough
hops
and
doesnt
finish
dry
enough
or
crisp
enough
to
keep
it
refreshing
it
is
still
a
very
good
beer
just
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
very
dry
finish
and
a
smooth
drinkability
a
really
complex
beer
thanks
to
dannys
for
the
extra
in
a
trade
what
else
can
i
say
but
wow
this
is
my
first
saison
and
im
debating
whether
to
try
any
others
as
it
may
ruin
this
first
experience
great
job
by
ommegang
for
creating
such
a
complex
yet
simple
tasting
brew
it
finishes
well
with
a
touch
of
plum
sweetness
and
tartness
like
a
grilled
apricot
soaked
in
scotch
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgians
to
date
great
rendition
and
readily
available
which
makes
it
even
better
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
i
mean
it
is
just
a
really
enjoyable
really
easy
going
beer
that
feels
like
a
session
beer
no
matter
what
the
7
7
abv
says
d
very
drinkable
one
of
my
first
forays
into
saisons
this
is
a
good
beer
drinkability
i
would
say
especially
high
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
as
well
as
especially
flavorful
pours
a
beautiful
light
golden
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
smells
a
bit
of
lemon
and
vanilla
with
some
sourness
and
overall
funkiness
to
it
the
head
has
fantastic
retention
with
very
nice
lacing
to
it
outstanding
flavor
with
notes
of
vanilla
lemon
and
hay
funkiness
theres
a
pleasant
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
a
beer
that
i
think
is
fantastic
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
why
exactly
does
funky
lemony
vanilla
hay
sound
good
well
no
but
drink
it
sometime
and
youll
find
that
it
actually
tastes
fantastic
the
beer
has
such
a
nice
smooth
drinkability
and
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
highly
recommended
incredibly
drinkable
this
seems
like
itd
be
the
perfect
way
to
end
a
hot
summers
day

say
the
least
with
a
medium
to
full
body
crisp
dry
and
quenching
one
of
the
worlds
perfect
food
beers
this
ale
begs
to
be
paired
with
some
great
pungent
cheeses
along
with
some
crisp
fruit
about
three
dollars
less
per
750
ml
bottle
than
the
true
belgians
with
every
bit
as
much
quality
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
recommend
hennepin
to
friends
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
an
enormous
fluffy
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
floating
up
the
side
of
the
glass
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
yeasty
with
lemoncitrus
and
spicy
wheat
taste
was
what
was
to
be
expected
from
the
smell
with
a
nice
crisp
twang
to
it
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
farmhouse
ale
its
definitely
shocking
that
this
beer
is
brewed
in
the
u
s
this
beer
is
quickly
becoming
a
staple
in
this
house
this
is
excellent
i
never
understood
why
people
spoke
highly
of
ommegang
until
i
tried
this
style
it
is
a
better
version
of
the
parent
duvel
standard
brew
this
has
lower
alchohol
phenol
scent
and
flavor
with
a
better
taste
best
ommegang
ive
had
had
on
tap
at
local
44
in
philly
poured
a
golden
wheat
color
with
a
light
white
head
smell
was
very
yeasty
and
citrusy
with
some
oils
of
hops
taste
was
similar
super
smooth
and
full
mellow
yeast
then
the
light
bite
of
the
hops
very
balanced
great
beer
have
a
bomber
of
this
which
ill
open
in
a
few
months
i
really
like
this
one
i
keep
forgetting
this
one
is
brewed
in
new
york
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
belgian
style
ales
i
have
had
d
give
me
a
warm
day
and
some
out
door
work
and
this
is
perfect
or
give
me
a
cold
day
and
a
warm
fire
and
this
is
perfect
or
leaves
changing
or
clouds
and
rain
d
with
the
exception
of
the
aforementioned
clove
the
drinkability
is
very
high
mouthfeel
is
a
little
spicy
and
theres
a
tart
bitterness
to
the
finish
the
alcohol
suits
the
mouthfeel
and
flavors
and
while
it
is
a
refreshing
brew
the
nearly
8
abv
doesnt
make
this
the
most
drinkable
of
beers
interestingly
i
remember
the
hennepin
i
had
on
tap
as
a
little
fruitier
nevertheless
this
is
a
great
offering
from
ommegang
and
id
think
about
returning
to
it
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
belgian
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
and
a
great
little
number
from
ommegang
d
good
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
dropping
a
lot
of
money
into
this
one
its
a
good
beer
but
i
think
there
are
better
belgians
out
there
d
an
excellent
saison
that
is
readily
available
and
a
great
value
its
ommegangs
most
approachable
beer
and
could
easily
be
a
good
gateway
brew
for
those
interested
in
trying
belgian
ales
d
super
high
session
beer
despite
being
almost
8
cant
taste
that
abv
and
lots
of
smooth
crisp
flavor
my
favorite
beer
from
ommegang
arrived
in
hennepin
tulip
glass
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
giant
sticky
bright
white
head
head
last
a
long
time
and
leaves
great
lacing
all
thru
the
drinking
smells
of
grapefruitcloves
and
a
little
hops
outstanding
taste
clean
yet
complex
flavors
of
citrus
cloves
and
yeast
the
flavors
change
with
each
sip
and
coats
the
mouth
with
unique
adventures
in
flavor
so
glad
this
is
a
domestic
product
as
the
price
is
right
for
such
a
great
belgian
style
this
will
be
making
a
permanent
home
in
my
fridge
for
the
next
several
months
great
beer
for
those
warm
nights
on
the
deck
in
the
end
the
beer
is
a
fine
saison
very
much
like
dupont
in
the
sweetlesness
quite
inviting
to
explore
this
style
to
a
fuller
extent
what
a
joy
note
this
is
for
the
7
7
abv
750ml
bottle
ive
had
the
7
5
abv
12oz
bottle
since
then
and
disappointingly
that
definitely
wouldnt
deserve
a
score
this
high
ill
update
this
sometime
when
i
can
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
excellent
beer
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
or
goldish
color
it
is
not
quite
clear
but
not
far
off
the
head
is
like
an
ice
cream
cone
bulging
over
the
rim
of
my
glass
it
is
so
thick
the
nose
has
a
grainy
strawlike
character
that
i
find
to
be
pretty
common
in
belgian
style
beers
there
is
a
nice
structure
to
the
flavor
the
foam
on
the
head
lends
itself
to
really
creaming
up
the
mouthfeel
the
grains
have
a
somewhat
spicy
character
and
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
spice
like
flavor
gives
the
beer
some
flair
d
while
it
has
a
different
flavor
its
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
high
in
my
opinion
hidden
alcohol
in
this
guy
is
a
bonus
i
think
ive
been
bragging
this
beer
up
to
a
buddy
of
mine
so
its
high
time
that
i
give
it
a
review
i
will
likely
be
biased
in
that
ive
drank
this
quite
a
bit
and
feel
that
it
may
be
the
best
beer
ive
had
im
sure
there
are
threads
in
the
forum
on
the
subject
but
if
i
was
forced
to
pick
a
single
beer
to
be
stuck
on
a
desert
island
with
this
would
be
the
one
pours
a
hazy
yet
bright
gold
with
a
tinge
of
orange
the
head
is
nice
and
fluffy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
oozing
beneath
smell
is
somewhat
typical
to
the
belgian
style
yeast
with
hints
of
lemon
grass
and
a
touch
of
bubble
gum
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
it
but
you
do
get
a
sense
of
earthiness
in
the
smell
and
taste
taste
is
magnificent
the
7
5
abv
is
unnoticeable
i
think
saisons
were
typically
made
in
the
winter
to
be
enjoyed
the
following
summer
but
it
would
take
more
willpower
than
i
have
to
wait
those
precious
months
for
this
beer
to
mature
thank
goodness
for
modern
refrigeration
also
ive
read
a
few
reviews
perhaps
complaining
of
too
much
carbonation
but
i
feel
that
it
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
this
brew
i
was
shocked
to
learn
the
abv
for
this
one
i
couldnt
taste
it
at
all
its
delicious
smooth
refreshing
and
intriguing
thats
a
great
combination
that
makes
it
very
amusing
light
colored
and
looks
very
light
has
some
awsome
bubble
carbonation
that
doesnt
go
away
looks
almost
like
a
coors
light
with
more
head
has
some
german
characteristics
in
the
smell
light
hops
and
sweet
malts
very
balanced
taste
has
slight
hop
bitterness
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
good
smoothe
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
awesome
you
could
drink
several
of
these
in
quick
succession
without
feeling
like
streaking
at
7
5
not
a
joke
and
kinda
dangerous
my
favorate
from
ommegang
which
is
saying
a
lot
d
overall
very
drinkable
extremely
tasty
consistent
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
drink
that
doesnt
grow
old
or
become
overpowering
with
alcohol
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
white
fluffy
head
it
was
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
i
get
lemony
citrusy
aromas
the
taste
is
better
than
expected
my
friend
alkemy
raves
about
this
beer
and
we
enjoy
different
styles
of
beer
it
has
lemon
and
spice
flavors
it
is
very
drinkable
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
even
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
a
rainy
cold
monday
but
overall
a
nice
selection
i
would
still
drink
allagash
white
first
though
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
spring
summer
evening
as
things
are
beginning
to
warm
up
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
d
this
is
a
delicious
brew
and
the
light
body
gives
it
the
drinkability
that
makes
ab
blush
with
the
high
alcohol
content
i
am
happy
i
can
only
afford
this
once
in
a
while
d
ive
had
some
outstanding
saisons
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
but
its
a
good
option
when
i
cant
get
the
ones
that
i
have
to
trade
for
ommegang
will
tell
you
that
hennepin
is
suited
to
every
season
but
id
insist
its
absolutely
ideal
for
spring
and
summer
wait
for
a
hot
sunny
day
and
sit
yourself
down
with
a
big
bottle
of
this
stuff
find
shade
under
a
tree
nestle
up
with
a
good
book
or
share
it
over
a
meal
with
family
and
friends
at
the
table
but
dont
just
take
my
word
on
it
try
it
for
yourself
d
one
of
my
favourite
saisons
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
it
yet
this
and
la
red
barn
are
the
top
2
easily
available
american
saisons
in
my
opinion
great
effort
by
ommegang
cant
wait
to
review
three
philosophers
overall
a
real
nice
offering
from
ommegang
good
to
see
some
stateside
folks
nailing
this
belgian
staple
overall
light
crisp
refreshing
and
a
nice
sweetsour
balance
on
first
swallow
all
i
get
is
a
real
earthy
taste
with
a
little
green
applepear
a
little
barnyardy
but
it
isnt
until
a
couple
seconds
have
passed
that
the
flavors
of
the
beer
really
come
out
this
is
when
the
tart
funkiness
starts
to
come
out
not
so
much
as
some
beers
ive
had
it
doest
really
taste
like
horse
blanket
or
anything
like
that
but
it
is
deliciously
tart
and
the
tartness
stays
on
the
palate
without
the
dank
earthyness
very
light
body
crisp
and
ephervescent
id
say
its
only
offdry
not
as
dry
as
some
others
ive
had
and
that
is
a
positive
impact
here
after
a
bit
it
starts
to
stick
to
the
tongue
i
can
see
why
this
is
such
a
wellregarded
saison
everyone
should
give
this
a
go
especially
when
the
mood
for
something
lighter
strikes
d
this
was
a
pretty
excellent
ale
especially
for
the
price
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
since
it
is
so
light
and
crisp
yet
delicious
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
slight
banana
tart
malt
earthy
malt
and
some
slight
bread
aromas
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
very
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy
malt
up
front
slight
banana
flavors
next
slight
hop
background
and
some
tart
malt
a
real
nice
blend
of
flavors
with
only
a
hint
of
dryness
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
brew
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
given
the
abv
that
could
get
me
in
some
trouble
but
i
would
most
certainly
enjoy
the
day
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
often
forget
to
buy
it
but
should
because
its
6080
of
the
cost
of
most
belgians
i
like
just
as
much
highly
recommend
this
one
if
youve
never
had
it
this
beer
would
be
good
for
anyone
who
likes
beer
in
even
the
slightest
respect
although
this
rivals
some
of
the
other
saisons
i
have
had
the
alcohol
taste
is
too
promenant
for
7
7
if
they
were
trying
to
hide
a
10
or
11
5
sleeper
in
a
farmhouse
ale
i
might
forgive
em
but
at
7
7
it
should
taste
like
a
sweet
dream
i
would
recommend
this
to
others
but
not
if
their
favorite
was
a
saison
they
would
pick
it
apart
this
beer
reminds
me
of
summertime
at
every
turn
it
looks
bright
and
light
it
smells
of
fruit
and
flowers
and
it
has
a
crisp
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
are
perfect
for
the
warm
weather
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
deck
in
the
july
sun
its
great
right
now
and
its
barely
spring
dotson
d
extremely
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
a
very
good
beer
im
guessing
that
the
whole
horse
blanket
brett
taste
isnt
for
me
i
just
found
it
to
be
a
taste
and
smell
that
im
not
fond
of
the
beer
looked
fine
with
a
nice
head
and
nice
lacing
and
im
sure
that
the
fine
craftspeople
at
ommegang
made
this
beer
just
how
they
wanted
to
but
unfortunately
its
not
for
me
not
gonna
have
another
nice
brew
very
similar
to
a
duvel
just
not
quite
the
masterpiece
mouthfeel
is
light
and
solventy
almost
acrylic
in
nature
i
could
feel
this
beer
lingering
on
the
enamel
of
my
teeth
highly
drinkable
belgian
farmmhouse
style
get
some
ordered
a
bottle
last
friday
at
picco
in
the
south
end
poured
into
an
ommegang
stemmed
glass
school
bus
yellow
color
huge
white
head
and
lacing
down
the
glass
almost
on
par
with
a
stout
very
nice
looking
smelled
like
an
excellent
german
hefe
with
lots
of
bananas
and
cloves
in
the
nose
taste
was
awesome
with
more
of
the
same
flavors
and
some
wheat
and
bubble
gum
flavor
mixed
in
very
light
on
the
palate
didnt
even
notice
the
abv
very
easy
to
drink
as
a
saison
should
be
better
than
most
belgian
or
french
versions
ive
tried
in
the
past
i
should
drink
this
more
often
paired
nicely
with
a
goat
cheese
and
roasted
red
pepper
pizza
d
this
beer
is
as
refreshing
as
any
wheat
in
the
beginning
anyways
i
thought
there
was
a
serious
breakdown
of
flavors
near
the
end
so
much
so
that
i
thought
someone
threw
a
farm
into
a
blender
and
served
it
to
me
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
ommegang
brews
because
this
one
was
a
minor
letdown
ommegang
makes
some
first
class
beer
the
taste
for
this
style
is
the
best
i
have
had
until
i
find
something
else
that
is
better
this
to
me
is
my
desert
island
beer
for
the
style
awesome
750
ml
bottle
im
having
this
sidebyside
with
saison
dupont
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
much
clearer
than
sd
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sits
high
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
smells
are
floral
yeasty
with
an
almost
selzerlike
element
a
bit
phenolic
but
not
in
a
bad
way
tastes
completely
different
than
sd
but
is
still
out
of
this
world
tastes
of
a
rich
blend
of
green
apples
pineapples
finish
is
quicker
and
dryer
than
sd
and
doesnt
punch
you
with
citrusy
zest
hennepin
is
pretty
suave
id
consider
sds
equal
except
that
its
body
lacks
that
electric
tingle
owing
i
assume
to
less
carbonation
this
beer
is
fabulous
and
proves
once
again
that
ommegang
is
an
amazing
brewery
i
hope
they
keep
it
up
mouthfeeldrinkability
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
it
is
the
world
beater
some
people
do
d
this
is
very
very
tasty
it
blends
some
flavors
from
several
different
styles
in
a
very
interesting
and
unique
profile
reasonably
priced
as
well
around
6
50
for
a
750ml
bottle
i
will
definitely
be
treating
myself
to
this
again
in
the
future
for
me
drinkability
is
moderate
if
you
would
like
to
acquire
the
taste
of
a
sour
this
saison
may
be
a
good
place
to
start
down
that
path
probably
best
drank
in
the
warmer
months
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
nose
and
nothing
in
it
blew
me
away
it
is
nicely
balanced
though
and
it
is
a
very
pleasant
drink
notes
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
this
one
and
its
awesome
i
love
it
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
although
its
typically
best
to
drink
in
the
summer
i
could
drink
this
any
time
of
year
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
have
a
few
in
the
cellar
that
im
going
to
let
sit
for
6
12
months
to
see
how
they
mature
mostly
experimental
i
would
enjoy
this
fresh
any
day
it
reminds
me
of
a
warm
summer
afternoon
sitting
on
the
patio
enjoying
the
weather
this
beer
definitely
makes
these
cold
latewinter
nights
bearable
exceptional
beer
has
a
cloudy
orangeish
yellow
with
a
tan
head
has
a
spicy
orangeish
smell
it
has
a
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
with
citrus
flavor
has
a
spicy
and
crisp
finish
to
this
beer
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
definetly
worth
getting
i
must
confess
this
is
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
indeed
i
was
turned
on
to
it
on
a
business
trip
to
rochester
mn
at
good
old
newts
shout
out
to
matt
the
bartender
i
have
converted
many
a
beer
drinkers
to
this
fine
brew
mouth
is
crisp
with
a
slight
bite
in
the
body
and
a
clean
finish
this
beer
drinks
way
too
easy
for
the
abv
definitely
buying
this
one
again
dill
have
this
one
again
its
nice
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
this
more
frequent
now
that
i
cant
get
saison
brett
from
boulevard
cheers
this
was
my
first
ommegang
beer
and
i
am
quite
pleased
for
a
beer
brewed
in
new
york
they
have
out
done
themselves
not
quite
as
good
as
a
true
belgian
but
its
definitely
knocking
on
its
door
very
nice
take
on
a
hard
beer
style
to
master
cant
beat
the
price
either
payed
less
than
7
for
a
750ml
overall
quite
different
from
the
usual
750
ml
bottles
ive
become
used
to
i
feel
somewhat
let
down
since
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
may
have
to
go
buy
a
750
ml
for
a
sidebyside
comparison
overall
a
very
solid
beer
kudos
taste
very
juicey
and
peppery
i
wish
there
was
more
fruitiness
to
the
taste
alot
like
a
tripel
mild
straw
color
kind
of
like
apple
juice
smells
of
a
mild
malt
with
butter
cream
and
some
spices
flavor
is
full
of
wheat
and
cloves
smoothed
out
by
a
buttery
flavor
and
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
nice
body
and
flavor
all
the
way
through
easy
to
drink
and
just
generally
a
good
brew
drinkability
very
pleasant
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
tripel
one
or
two
of
an
evening
would
be
just
fine
d
very
nice
a
classic
saison
through
and
through
im
a
big
fan
and
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
750
ml
with
my
lady
would
gladly
buy
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
d
dangerous
i
could
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
this
goes
down
amazingly
easily
hazy
orangeyellow
with
lively
bubbling
and
a
solid
head
coarse
grassy
hop
aroma
and
some
belgian
spiciness
and
funk
sharp
is
a
good
word
for
the
nose
on
this
one
feels
a
bit
watery
and
finely
carbonated
champagnelike
grassy
hops
are
in
the
flavour
as
well
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
spiciness
and
banana
overall
the
flavours
have
a
bit
of
a
rough
edge
i
think
d
i
could
certainly
drink
the
entire
bottle
this
is
an
excellent
beer
pours
golden
into
glass
nice
head
good
retention
nice
yeasty
esthers
on
the
nose
taste
is
marred
by
high
alcohol
content
not
very
balanced
good
carbonation
fit
for
style
overall
drinkability
flawed
by
lingering
alcohol
flavor
on
finish
not
bad
but
not
balanced
enough
to
be
great
pours
a
light
golden
color
some
bubbles
average
head
diminishing
malty
belgian
aroma
not
as
floral
some
nose
of
alcohol
malty
sour
taste
some
belgian
and
also
some
alcohol
floral
aftertaste
warming
up
a
bit
the
tastes
blend
together
better
not
bad
a
decent
belgian
overall
it
is
a
big
beer
very
complexed
with
a
whole
lot
going
on
as
far
as
flavor
it
is
definitely
not
for
beginners
but
this
beer
is
without
a
doubt
worth
a
try
a
very
fun
beer
to
drink
and
breakdown
d
im
not
quite
used
to
the
sour
especially
sour
without
a
powerful
bitter
alongside
it
its
an
energetic
little
brew
i
see
myself
pouring
to
the
end
of
this
bottle
quickly
with
no
complaints
great
masking
on
its
8
5
abv
if
not
for
savoring
the
sour
this
stuff
drinks
like
a
light
beer
ommegang
i
continue
to
enjoy
tasting
my
way
through
your
great
beers
pours
a
light
transparent
yellow
slightly
cloudy
but
mostly
transparent
tons
of
carbonation
apparent
in
the
body
tons
a
smooth
white
head
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
lemon
grass
bubble
gum
pale
malt
sweetness
and
yeast
taste
mostly
mirrors
the
scent
but
with
just
a
touch
of
tartness
a
nice
earthyness
which
matches
the
sweetness
enough
hops
to
make
their
presence
known
in
the
backdrop
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
touch
too
carbonated
though
that
is
fairly
typical
for
the
style
smooth
and
refreshing
alcohol
barely
noticeable
a
great
blend
of
sweetness
and
earthyness
and
a
touch
of
tart
fantastic
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
any
meal
or
at
any
time
an
extremely
versatile
brew
d
it
was
pretty
good
except
for
the
strong
metallic
earthy
taste
a
beer
i
liked
more
then
i
expected
or
thought
i
would
whether
you
are
a
real
hard
core
fan
of
this
style
it
is
one
worth
giving
a
shot
could
see
pairing
up
real
nice
with
a
spicy
meal
note
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
however
its
somewhat
highly
rated
because
it
does
exhibit
the
characteristics
that
the
style
description
lists
once
i
get
more
experience
with
saisons
i
may
edit
this
review
to
better
reflect
that
rating
of
its
characteristics
poured
a
golden
hazy
color
with
a
big
head
smell
is
impressive
almost
hefe
like
to
me
big
banana
and
coriander
taste
is
nice
and
is
slightly
sour
to
me
this
was
highly
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
abv
is
surprising
because
it
was
fairly
light
beer
abv
became
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warmed
high
abv
would
prevent
me
from
pounding
these
back
but
that
is
the
only
reason
nice
brew
d
a
high
point
both
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
notably
desirable
in
the
want
to
have
again
categories
a
fine
example
of
the
style
havent
had
more
than
a
couple
usmade
saisons
that
can
compete
if
this
is
the
archetype
saison
i
shall
be
having
more
this
is
one
of
the
finest
brews
i
have
experienced
wow
you
have
got
to
try
this
one
it
satisfies
my
hop
head
desires
while
still
preserving
the
ancient
belgium
art
of
bottle
conditioning
unfiltered
ales
with
a
boat
load
of
living
yeast
drinkability
is
solid
the
dryness
might
limit
it
if
drinking
it
by
itself
i
bet
it
would
go
great
with
fetuccine
alfredo
just
might
have
to
try
that
next
time
drinkability
complex
and
balanced
flavor
makes
this
an
excellent
quality
brew
the
last
drink
leaves
you
wanting
another
this
is
quickly
becoming
a
favorite
on
tap
at
fathers
office
absolutely
brilliant
color
luminous
straw
ok
i
smelled
and
smelled
and
smelled
this
with
myself
some
friends
and
my
mom
who
has
the
nose
of
a
bloodhound
this
stuff
smells
like
cooked
strawberries
and
then
a
bacon
and
pancake
breakfast
like
nothing
i
have
ever
experienced
taste
was
a
very
very
very
good
farmhouse
almost
to
the
caliber
of
avec
les
bons
voeux
but
not
quite
citrus
was
nicely
balanced
by
malt
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
extremely
high
due
to
great
taste
and
its
feeling
as
a
session
beer
good
good
stuff
i
went
to
an
opera
after
this
and
this
saison
added
to
that
experience
drinkability
one
750ml
is
about
all
i
would
care
to
drink
in
one
sitting
not
bad
but
a
little
filling
and
not
exactly
what
i
typically
choose
to
drink
i
do
however
appreciate
the
style
and
will
continue
to
try
new
saisons
i
believe
this
to
be
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
i
havent
tried
many
belgiumstyle
beers
before
so
wanted
to
give
this
a
shot
its
a
good
beer
but
im
not
a
fan
drinkability
good
quality
not
my
favorite
but
a
great
crossover
beer
from
macros
suprised
about
the
alchol
content
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
serve
with
a
lemon
and
i
think
the
bud
drinkers
can
handle
this
especially
if
they
like
blue
moon
d
very
quaffable
would
make
for
an
amazing

alcohol
is
hidden
well
highly
recommended
overall
this
was
a
real
treat
it
was
cool
to
try
a
new
style
and
i
really
liked
it
d
excellent
crisp
dry
finish
combines
with
a
soft
malt
and
complex
fruity
ester
character
to
make
a
very
drinkable
saison
bring
on
another
pint
and
cheers
to
a
wonderful
american
brewery
brewing
a
strong
example
of
this
belgian
style
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
makes
this
a
crisp
easy
drinking
beer
dangerous
bc
the
alcohol
is
completely
masked
ive
only
tried
these
three
saisons
but
without
a
doubt
i
enjoyed
hennepin
the
most
with
its
lively
carbonation
it
is
a
great
beer
to
replace
champagne
with
for
those
special
occasions
and
it
also
gets
the
job
done
on
those
extra
hot
summer
days
when
a
ba
needs
a
cold
one
a
top
tier
saison
one
of
my
favorites
and
for
the
price
you
just
cant
beat
it
poured
into
duvel
tulip
a
massive
rocky
head
appears
that
hangs
out
with
you
for
a
while
color
was
slightly
murkey
light
golden
smell
is
great
a
nice
combination
of
some
funk
tartness
fruits
and
yeast
i
noticed
some
sour
apple
right
away
taste
was
pretty
much
on
par
with
the
smell
some
yeast
and
bread
typical
of
many
belgians
with
that
funky
tartness
a
good
band
name
and
sligh
kiss
of
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
high
carbonation
and
dry
feeling
almost
is
reminicant
of
champagne
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
not
nearly
as
scary
as
i
had
feared
would
buy
again
now
i
want
to
try
some
more
of
this
style
p
s
living
just
2
hours
from
cooperstown
i
decided
a
road
trip
was
in
order
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
have
some
of
the
best
brews
in
this
fine
country
of
ours
tastes
of
grass
a
hint
of
lemon
fruit
spice
and
a
touch
of
citrus
end
has
a
little
bitterness
to
it
pours
a
hazy
bright
golden
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
rich
wheaty
slightly
lemony
aroma
calls
for
a
sip
flavor
is
crisp
mouthfilling
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
texture
is
smooth
and
refreshing
to
give
a
pleasant
and
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
its
chewy
and
sticky
on
the
palate
the
true
farmhouse
finish
is
excellent
carbonation
is
high
but
in
a
very
good
way
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
could
definitely
see
myself
downing
glass
after
glass
of
this
by
the
pool
during
the
summer
its
extremely
refreshing
definitely
my
favorite
ommegang
brew
so
far
overall
i
am
ashamed
it
took
me
soo
long
to
try
this
one
it
was
spot
on
just
what
i
needed
tonight
and
just
what
the
style
called
for
i
will
make
this
my
go
to
for
the
style
from
now
on
for
sure
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
longlasting
head
good
lacing
plenty
of
activity
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
smell
reminiscent
of
a
few
other
belgians
ive
tried
smooth
and
sweet
at
first
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
bite
at
the
end
citrusyfruity
with
a
hop
kick
dry
the
carbonation
is
tickly
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
this
fits
into
the
category
of
beers
you
need
to
know
the
abv
of
beforehand
the
7

is
very
well
masked

unique
beer
not
something
id
want
on
a
regular
basis

a
nice
treat
future
outlook
nice
solid
tasting
versatile
drinker
after
being
hugely
disappointed
in
my
sampling
of
ommegangs
chocolate
indulgence
this
offering
has
restored
my
faith
that
they
can
produce
a
quality
beer
id
have
this
brew
again
anytime

and
very
crisp
on

the
flavour
is
quite
nice
and
has
some
hints
of
a
wheat
beer
i
think
its
own
description
is
selling
itself
short
by
claiming
it
to
be
a
light
on
the
tongue
finish
especially
dupont
and
fantome
a
full

easily
the

here
is
worth
the
price
of

this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it

could
put
a

like
to

a
pale

with
a
slowly
diminishing
head
that
left
decent
lacing
on

the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
light
fruitiness
that
was
accompanied
by
a
good
spiciness
the
great
spiciness
overpowered
the
taste
there
was
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
that
provided
a
good
background
to
the
spices
the
beer
sits
lightly
and
very
crisp
on

the
alcohol
was
also
well
hidden
this
is
a
very

but
a
bit
of
hops
came
through
later
the
biggest
taste
left
with
me
after
each
sip
was
of
a
sourish
funk
with
the
noble
hops
the
taste
is
of

the

just

was
tart
a

balance

this

this
would
be
a

beverage
to

on

up
with

i
open
up
the

brewery
notes
once
ajusted
to

this
is
a

beer
this
is
not
a

like

this
a

in

and

medium

and
creamy

finishes
powdery
sweet
and
lightly
tart
all
the
while
dry
and
crisp
the
aftertaste
leaves
malty
sweetness
on
the
light
side
leaving
me
wanting
another
sip
you
will
find
this
beer
interesting
from
start
to
finish
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
that
you
couldnt
possibly
get
bored
drunk
yes
bored
no
great
example
of
a
farmhouse
saison
when
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
i
got
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
massive
head
of
foam
got
the
same
head
of
foam
everytime
when
i
poured
a
little
more
into
my
glass
when
it
got
a
little
low
the
smell
had
lots
of
fruits
and
spices
in
it
it
smelled
like
wine
but
better
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
spices
fruit
and
citrus
in
it
and
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
very
complex
this
beer
is
cheap
at
below
5
for
750ml
bottle
and
one
hell
of
a
good
beer
this
is
another
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
keep
up
the
good
work
ommegang
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
brew
found
it
ontap
at
red
bones
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
yellow
in
color
slight
copper
tinge
slight
head
that
created
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
of
lace
nose
is
citrus
with
some
spice
hovering
in
the
background
flavor
was
great
lots
of
spice
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
truckloads
of
spice
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
tongue
alcohol
came
through
quite
vibrantly
also
mouthfeel
was
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
with
a
thick
and
heavy
feel
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
a
750ml
of
hennepin
is
my
personal
favorite
for
a
postwork
relaxation
session
goes
well
with
winning
streaks
by
the
new
york
metropolitans
let
me
just
say
i
could
not
believe
the
appearance
of
this
in
the
glass
i
had
a
750
ml
bottle
and
the
first
pour
was
extremely
clear
it
had
a
nice
golden
orange
color
which
was
so
clear
it
was
like
looking
through
a
window
the
second
pour
was
a
little
bit
more
cloudy
because
of
the
yeast
follow
through
this
is
the
best
part
the
yeast
really
intensified
the
smell
and
flavor
of
this
beer
had
a
scent
and
taste
of
coriander
and
citrus
which
was
wellbalanced
with
the
malt
flavors
very
refreshing
and
tasty
in
and
highly
recommended
this
is
one
incredible
ale
enjoyable
experience
indeed
the
nose
is
extremely
complex
it
is
earthy
and
yeasty
it
is
of
heavy
spices
the
taste
is
wonderful
it
is
also
earthy
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
backed
by
less
spice
than
the
smell
suggests
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
better
than
good
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
maybe
even
for
two
days
the
4
50
per
bottle
is
a
huge
selling
point
pack
up
the
picnic
basket
with
some
ham
swiss
on
rye
and
a
playful
companion
enjoy
the
day
deep
yellow
with
a
substantial
light
yellow
head
smells
of
tart
fruits
and
delicate
hops
sweet
grains
also
present
lovely
balanced
scent
the
fruits
are
present
to
taste
but
more
citrus
than
expected
the
hops
are
indeed
delicate
and
subtle
but
still
noticeable
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
taste
that
expands
delightfully
in
the
mouth
fantastic
the
taste
is
amazing
a
lot
of
banana
like
esters
with
a
little
bit
of
orange
or
citrus
zing
the
flavor
makes
it
very
easy
to
give
this
beer
a
swish
great
mouthfee
moderate
carbonation
on
this
one
youll
know
when
you
pop
the
cork
great
drinkability
thanks

cooperstown
drinkability
is
awesome
im
only
getting
the
slightest
warming
in
my
stomach
i
really
like
this
beer
big
and
quenching
this
one
blew
the
cork
out
along
with
the
cork
cage
before
i
had
fully
undone
the
cage
powerful
blast
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
very
tall
head
that
leaves
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
spices
along
with
a
solid
malt
backing
slight
hop
character
as
well
the
flavor
has
a
nice
spice
character
and
a
definite
hop
presence
very
interesting
mixture
blends
well
for
a
crisp
taste
finish
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmoderate
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
now
im
always
in
the
mood
for
hennepin
but
i
can
see
this
lovely
caveaged
version
being
more
of
a
specific
craving
that
being
said
i
can
see
cravings
for
this
happening
frequently
the
sad
thing
is
there
are
only
3360
out
there
mine
was
number
1010
oh
well
get
it
while
its
there
yummy
yummy
yummy
where
the
hell
is
cave
aged
three
philosophers
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
champagne
like
effervescence
easily
drinkable
the
750
goes
down
like
water
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
drink
this
one
outside
and
enjoy
yourself
on
a
sunny
day
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
incredible
it
is
so
smooth
and
wonderful
you
could
drink
it
all
night
but
at
over
7
abv
youd
regret
it
in
the
morning
i
suppose
hazed
yellow
with
a
monster
head
this
beer
reveals
its
pleasures
when
it
warms
up
the
nose
becomes
fruity
withnotes
of
yeast
and
flowers
the
taste
is
incredibly
complex
yet
easy
drinking
and
summery
i
think
that
next
to
southhampton
this
is
new
worlds
best
saison
try
it
with
food
as
this
beer
is
truly
food
friendly
appearance
is
great
perfect
clear
no
yeast
in
the
pour
at
first
peach
color
with
a
totally
luscious
looking
cream
colored
head
that
wont
go
away
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
smell
is
pepper
and
clove
and
yeasty
spiciness
more
than
anything
phenols
in
the
background
taste
is
bursting
with
flavor
orange
and
other
citrus
at
the
front
with
plenty
of
spiciness
to
go
around
as
the
brew
moves
around
my
mouth
dry
finish
very
quenching
and
went
suberbly
with
the
mexican
food
i
had
for
dinner
this
is
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
is
very
light
which
is
par
for
the
style
adding
the
yeast
isnt
recommended
as
the
extra
spiciness
kills
some
of
the
nuances
of
this
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
tremendous
head
that
never
seems
to
settle
the
smell
is
very
pleasant
and
almost
sweet
like
a
belgian
trippel
with
the
wheat
really
coming
out
the
first
taste
is
much
different
than
the
ones
that
follow
and
there
is
a
lot
of
layers
to
it
it
starts
out
with
some
candied
fruits
or
other
sweet
additives
presumably
the
hops
and
leaves
a
satisfying
citrus
in
your
mouth
after
it
is
finished
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
get
through
all
the
foam
and
really
get
into
the
beer
this
is
pretty
light
but
still
good
for
anytime
of
year
this
delicious
brew
will
be
a
staple
of
my
collection
overall
still
very
drinkable
but
not
as
good
overall
as
my
last
ontap
sample
i
will
surely
still
buy
this
but
wish
i
could
have
my
own
little
stash
of
it
ontap
in
my
house
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
sessionable
if
the
tartness
doesnt
get
to
you
second
glassfull
paired
well
with
some
asiago
cheese
no
im
not
an
employee
or
stockholder
in
the
brewery
drinkability
probably
the
best
saison
i
have
encountered
from
the
usa
still
no
fantome
but
its
not
that
far
off
excellent
this
is
a
great
beer
this
could
turn
out
to
be
the
highlight
of
my
recent
beer
trip
to
northern
idaho
i
really
hope
this
shows
up
in
huckleberrys
soon
though
i
wouldnt
call
40
miles
too
far
to
go
to
get
this
750
ml
bottle
conditioned
corked
and
caged
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
goblet
looks
amazing
3
finger
head
that
is
so
close
to
white
and
pokes
out
the
top
of
the
glass
it
is
rocky
and
sticky
leaving
big
clumps
of
foam
for
lace
the
body
is
a
hazy
orangeamber
with
a
buncha
stuff
floating
around
aroma
is
outdoorsy
with
grapes
white
wine
lemons
some
tropical
fruits
and
a
big
spiciness
it
is
sharp
and
spicy
on
the
palate
with
yeast
lemons
wine
and
is
kinda
dry
it
has
a
very
distinct
taste
that
lingers
and
makes
you
want
more
smooth
and
warming
with
a
full
body
and
makes
you
really
burpy
in
a
class
all
its
own
this
is
a
world
class
brew
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
missing
out
on
whenever
i
see
a
bottle
of
hennpin
im
gonna
be
picking
it
up
fills
my
glass
cloudy
and
pale
gold
in
hue
topped
by
an
intimidating
white
head
strong
aroma
involving
fruits
bready
pale
malts
yeast
a
little
spice
and
some
citrous
hops
taste
is
bold
and
complex
bready
malt
jumps
out
quickly
before
bitter
lemons
and
citrous
rinds
attack
the
tongue
some
caramellike
sweetness
dances
with
spice
but
there
is
an
underlying
creaminess
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
but
crisp
carbonation
and
the
zesty
hops
really
blast
inside
the
mouth
finishes
just
like
it
begins
but
leaving
a
very
enjoyable
long
lasting
aftertaste
with
some
fruity
yeasty
character
to
it
overall
a
bitter
impression
is
left
on
my
palate
the
taste
is
wonderful
sweet
honey
hits
first
which
quickly
makes
way
for
vanilla
citrus
and
a
slight
banana
the
sour
fruit
taste
is
dominant
backed
up
by
a
slight
hint
of
spice
and
coriander
hop
hit
is
noticeable
especially
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
does
not
take
over
alcohol
warming
is
moderate
the
beer
is
aggressively
effervescent
and
mediumbodied
served
out
of
a
750

into
a
duvel

beutiful
hazy
golden

with
a
thick

is
delicious
sweet
fruity
banana
bread
yeasty
and
even
a
little
peppery
spices
hit
up
front
giving
way
to
a
fruity
finishorange
mainly
but
a
little
lemon
and
banana
too
mouthfeel
is
amazingthick
and
full
bodied
it
almost
taste
like
your
chewing
bread
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
most
belgian
styles
are
a
little
too
intensely
spiced
for
me
and
not
that
drinkablebut
this
one
has
just
the
right
balance
and
i
could
have
it
all
night
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
everyday
for
the
but
that
being
said
this
was
a
great
beer
honey
gold
straw
with
a
white
head
that
became
spotty
a
hoppy
fruity
nose
of
citrus
and
yeast
distinct
belgian
yeast
taste
followed
by
a
creamy
citrus
softness
lined
with
noble
hops
quite
a
mouthful
and
deceptive
with
the
high
alcohol
content
i
had
this
once
a
long
time
ago
before
my
days
of
beer
advocacy
and
since
then
i
have
overlooked
it
im
excited
to
try
it
once
again
appears
a
very
light
orange
color
almost
yellow
crystal
clear
i
mean
i
dont
think
ive
ever
seen
a
beer
this
clear
rising
bubbles
and
big
white
fluffy
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
smell
is
yeasty
bready
zesty
spicy
and
dusty
unfortunately
its
not
as
dusty
and
funky
in
the
taste
not
quite
a
true
belgian
in
that
sense
but
it
is
very
good
dont
get
me
wrong
ive
recently
become
obsessed
with
the
best
belgian
pale
ales
de
ranke
xx
and
orval
specifically
i
love
that
dry
hoppy
grassy
taste
ive
been
searching
for
a
cheaper
alternative
that
is
equally
satisfying
and
refreshing
and
this
is
a
close
one
the
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
decently
bitter
and
with
a
nice
soft
buttery
malt
taste
the
dusty
taste
i
like
is
noticable
too
a
definate
plus
really
smooth
mouthfeel
and
this
beer
is
highly
refreshing
which
makes
it
highly
quaffable
really
a
good
beer
really
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
theres
something
about
those
beers
from
belgium
that
are
just
indescribable
that
cant
be
found
elsewhere
this
beer
is
not
to
be
faulted
though
for
not
having
that
quality
however
an
awesome
beer
from
cooperstown
what
a
friggin
great
beer
what
a
phenomenal
introduction
to
the
saison
after
not
working
well
with
rare
vos
hennepin
has
bumped
up
my
already
solid
praise
for
ommegang
the
body
and
the
finish
would
lead
well
into
some
grilled
chicken
or
maybe
shrimp
this
beer
tastes
very
much
like
a
witbier
dont
know
what
thats
about
fruity
citrus
base
with
some
grassiness
a
tart
sourlike
finish
even
though
this
is
a
siason
i
think
its
a
little
too
tart
for
the
style
big
citrus
sour
aftertaste
kind
of
ruins
the
complexity
of
this
beer
imo
finished
clean
and
semidry
not
the
greatest
siason
as
many
bas
have
proclaimed
it
is
southamptons
is
much
better
note
ive
tried
a
couple
of
belgian
style
beers
in
the
past
and
never
been
impressed
this
has
changed
my
opinion
this
may
be
my
favorite
beer
to
date
if
you
try
this
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
more
than
one
slàinte
this
is
not
my
type
of
beer
but
when
i
saw
it
and
had
read
so
many
positive
reviews
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
comes
packaged
in
a
beautiful
bottle
with
champagne
style
capping
pours
tremendously
cloudy
with
very
unsubtle
sunset
colors
the
suggested
serving
glass
call
for
a
widemouth
glass
i
used
a
red
wine
glass
upon
pouring
a
swelling
of
orange
berries
and
some
serious
alcohol
infused
my
nostrils
this
beer
taste
like
a
summer
beer
overloaded
with
sweetly
hops
that
balance
each
other
this
beer
almost
transcends
beer
at
its
strangest
and
purest
points
a
serious
beer
but
is
it
really
a
beer
or
should
it
be
in
its
own
category
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
as
ive
never
had
a
saison
but
this
seemed
to
be
rated
pretty
high
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
along
with
a
750
of
ommegang
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
constant
source
of
fizz
the
huge
billowy
foam
cap
seems
to
grow
even
after
the
pour
is
done
smells
fantastic
very
spicey
but
otherwise
difficult
to
place
tastes
spicey
as
well
with
a
hint
of
a
hop
bite
in
the
end
taste
seems
to
morph
as
the
drinker
becomes
acclimatized
and
the
beer
warms
seems
to
have
a
buttery
banana
ester
quality
at
some
point
that
fades
into
a
funky
belgian
yeasty
clove
flavor
i
will
definitely
try
other
saisons
drinkbaility
and
overall
excellent
this
is
ommegangs
best
of
what
ive
had
excellent
im
really
impressed
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
try
it
chill
hazed
golden
body
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
smells
of
caramel
apples
yeasty
bread
sweet

and

and
flavor
taste
consists
of
caramel
and
candy
sweetness
overripe
pears
winelike
sour
grapes
and
a
well
blended

and

750
ml
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
thick
creamy
white
fluffy
head
that
held
its
own
for
the
enitre

small
spots
of

on
the

of
the

citrusy
notes
along
with
spices
and
some
funky

tart

along

some
earthy
flavors
good
amount

peppery
earthy
hops
at

very
refreshing
the
complexity
works
so
well
in
this
beer
this
would
be
great
in
warm
weather
or
cold
high
carbonation
great
drinkability
despite
all
of
the
complex
flavors
excellent
saison
taste
yeasty
with
an
interesting
alcohol
finish
which
gives
it
sort
of
a
lactic
and
creamy
feel
with
just
a
bit
of
funk
which
reminds
me
of
a
camenbert
cheeze
nice
wow
i
really
dig
this
one
its
a
tart
and
spicy
masterpiece
bottle
conditioned
saison
from
new
york
hmm
lets
give
it
a
go
it
pours
a
pale
clear
yellow
almost
looks
like
a
pale
alemacro
lager
not
much
head
on
this
moderate
lacing
smells
slightly
funky
like
outdoors
in
the
spring
taste
is
slightly
metallic
and
slightly
sour
at
the
same
time
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
in
there
as
well
overcarbonated
in
my
book
not
a
hit
not
something
id
look
for
again
ommegangs
best
offering
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
through
the
middle
but
then
becomes
quite
dry
in
the
finish
this
is
nice
and
spicy
with
competing
notes
of
pepper
ginger
lemon
zest
coriander
this
beer
has
a
nice
soft
sweet
grain
character
which
mixes
quite
well
with
and
in
fact
even
accentuates
the
refreshing
cool
citrus
notes
this
beer
is
very
good
it
is
just
about
the
perfect
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
over
an
evening
the
one
flaw
is
that
it
is
perhaps
a
little
to
thick
in
the
body
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
by
no
means
thick
it
is
just
that
i
like
my
farmhouse
ales
with
a
nice
dry
light
palate
i
had
forgotton
how
tasty
this
beer
was
and
at
3
00
for
a
750ml
it
is
a
steal
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
gold
with
a
good
2
finger
head
great
retention
and
great
lace
excellent
smell
yeasty
with
some
hits
of
banana
and
sweet
malt
both
barley
and
wheat
some
slight
hop
floralness
complex
but
not
overpowering
outstanding
taste
somewhat
tart
and
yeasty
with
nicely
balanced
hops
some
banana
and
clove
notes
as
well
finishes
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
well
worth
the
4
99
i
paid
for
the
750ml
an
excellent
value
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thick
rich
white
head
that
settled
to
a
complex
lace
in
the
tulip
glass
i
used
the
nose
has
a
yeastydoughy
character
up
front
with
bright
grapefruit
from
the
hops
and
a
mild
candy
character
from
the
malt
very
layered
and
complex
the
taste
has
an
awakening
tartness
followed
by
a
mild
bitterness
the
play
between
the
sweetness
and
tartness
is
very
pronounced
light
and
slick
mouth
feel
leads
to
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
new
york
brewery
is
producing
a
fine
version
of
the
saison
style
still
new
to
style
i
have
studied
janfeb
zymurgy
for
some
details
it
is
sweetness
kept
in
check
with
the
hops
herbs
coriander
and
spicesginger
orange
zest
this
grisette
farmhouse
ale
really
has
a
earthiness
to
it
very
unique
taste
but
very
drinkable
this
is
a
lightmedium
bodied
brew
very
good
long
dry
finish
wish
i
was
sharing
it
with
an
expert
on
the
style
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden

supports
a
towering
rocky
cotton
white

ale
that
has
just
the

amount

one
of
the
best
usmade
belgian
ales
ive
had
had
this
brew
the
other
night
from
a
750
ml
bottle
the
brew
poured
to
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
foamy
head
that
had
incredible
retention
and
left
chunky
lacing
through
out
the
carbonation
is
very
active
with
a
good
deal
of
small
reminds
me
of
champagne
bubbles
coursing
up
the
side
this
is
a
very
inviting
looking
beer
something
about
it
just
says
it
looks
perfect
the
aromas
have
a
pronounced
belgian
scent
to
it
from
the
yeast
i
would
presume
very
earthy
scene
highlights
of
pepper
grapes
citrus
like
hop
qualities
and
a
sweet
aroma
very
drinkable
brew
somewhat
sweet
with
a
fruit
citrus
like
taste
ending
with
a
balanced
hop
ness
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
over
all
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
ahh
near
perfection
in
my
glass
this
is
just
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
drink
all
night
long
and
never
be
bored
by
crisp
and
light
mild
fruit
pears
and
apples
with
subtle
spice
clean
and
smooth
very
nice
carbonation
as
well
not
overly
carbonated
but
just
enough
to
be
refreshing
no
odd
flavors
nothing
to
make
you
go
wow
or
huh
with
some
citrus
fruits
hiding
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
initially
sweet

they
add

my

is

and
this
is
another
beer
to
definitely
try
and
a
good
idea
for
a
first
try
in
the
belgian
style
from
what
i
can
tell
this
is
the
best
beer
brewed
in
north
america
it
speaks
of
nectarine
and
pepper
from

it
is

the
aroma
is
a
spicy
sourness
that
really
is
refreshing
i
definitely
detect
saaz
hops
also
some
delicate
malt
character
the
flavor
starts
out
quite
tart
and
hoppy
then
more
hoppy
and
malty
near
the
middle
theres
also
a
lot
of
sour
fruitiness
going
on
grapefruit
especially
more
delicate
malt
is
detectable
which
is
a
little
bready
even
with
the

im

its

tartness
i
was
expecting
more
depth
and
complexity
to
this
brew
but
it
held
back
until
the
finish
it
mellowed
to
a
nice
balance
at
the
end
and
the
tartness
faded
to
sweet
there
was
a
spotty
lace
left
on
the
glass
kind
of
like
the
beer
itself
have
enjoyed
this
many
times
but
never
sat
down
and
tried
to
describe
it
im
finding
it
difficult
for
some
reason
i
think
mostly
because
theres
a
lot
going
on
shimmering
platinum
with
blossoming
head
although
i
did
not
experience
the
retention
that
many
described
a
floral
perfumey
nose
with
champagnelike
yeasts
flavors
include
lemon
white
grapes
almonds
apples
yellow
or
green
spices
and
pepper
with
a
quite
sour
finish
malts
are
incredibly
delicate
and
hops
only
underscore
the
spices
of
the
big
yeast
profile
a
saison
perhaps
but
i
found
this
merging
into
duvel
pale
tripel
territory
due
to
its
brightness
and
zesty
lemon
flavors
and
almost
none
of
the
tea
or
peach
flavors
that
i
associate
with
a
saison
i
imagine
a
good
meal
would
bring
out
the
heartier
aspects
of
this
brew
as
such
it
remains
an
excellent
us
version
of
a
belgian
and
surprisingly
cooling
and
refreshing
huge
offwhite
head
on

quite

sticky
pale

aroma
with
a
healthy
dose
esters
thrown
in
tastes
sweet
without
being
overly
sweet
itself
flavors
like
pale
malt
honey
vanilla
there
was
even
a
tiny
toastiness
that
found
its
way
into
my
glass
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
wasnt
too
prevalent
however
there
was
some
pepperiness
to
the
beer
carbonation
was
bigger
than
id
like
and
the
beer
was
more
viscous
than
any
saison
ive
come
across
although
there
was
some
sourness
there
is
not
as
much
as
i
had
expected
from
a
beer
of
this
style
this
beer
was
received
as
a
christmas
gift
in
the
three
pack
from
the
ommegang
brewery
the
beer
poured
quite
lively
into
the
glass
forming
a
dense
long
lasting
head
with
a
beautiful
color
the
overwhelming
nose
was
that
of
apples
i
took
some
time
just
enjoying
the
aroma
the
taste
on
the
palate
was
clean
and
light
with
the
bitterness
being
subdued
and
later
the
beer
tasted
deceptively
light
for
the
high
alcoholic
strength
the
finish
was
short
and
clean
before
i
knew
it
the
glass
was
empty
a
fine
and
tasty
example
of
the
style
taste
merits
a
rating
higher
than
5
incredbly
smooth
tasting
considering
its
crisp
hoppy
characteristics
all
of
which
make
this
a
great
choice
for
those
lazy
afternoons

with
the
malt
flavors
up
front
this
is
followed
by
citrus
flavors
and
spice
flavors
blending
in
with
the
malt
and
being
balanced
with
the
effervescence
of
this
well
carbonated
ale
the
finish
is
dry
with
notes
of
apple
and
pear
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
balanced
against
the
alcohol
the
aftertaste
is
a
lingering
sweetness
with
citrus
and
alcohol
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
pleasant
with
effervescent
tingling
imho
this
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
made
in
the
world
it
goes
great
with
food
or
just
sipping
in
the
afternoon
summer
or
winter
started
out
pouring
a
nice
golden
hazy
yellow
with
an
average
head
of
foam
the
smell
and
taste
was
pleasant
but
not
what
i
expected
the
carbination
and
bitterness
was
well
balanced
but
i
was
just
not
impressed
with
the
taste
are
we
sure
this
one
isnt
from
belgium
pale
yellowish
color
fresh
floralcitrusy
nose
quite
like
a
witbier
very
beautiful
very
inviting
who
could
refuse
a
sip
of
a
brew
so
friendlytaste
is
extremely
satisfying
if
lacking
depth
but
then
like
many
pretty
things
its
not
meant
to
be
deep
just
delicious
dlightful
dlovely
the
smell
is
fruity
almost
like
a
hoegaarden
the
taste
is
great
fruit
a
tad
of
spice
real
light
for
the
abv
very
drinkable
the
750
was
perfect
with
the
thanksgiving
turkey
had
a
750
ml
bottle
and
this
beer
was
excellent
it
poored
great
with
a
big
foamy
rocky
amber
head
it
has
a
great
fruity
sweet
nose
its
taste
is
malty
w
a
honey
start
that
drys
a
bit
on
the
finish
7
5
abv
but
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
will
be
drinking
regularly
when
i
want
an
belgian
style
ale
holy
crap
thats
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thick
head
the
one
overriding
flavor
theme
that
i
found
in
this
beer
yet
no
one
else
has
mentioned
is
apple
perhaps
my
tastebuds
are
screwed
up
but
everytime
i
drink
this
i
can
swear
i
taste
apples
like
in
a
strong
nay
very
strong
cider
its
a
shame
ive
only
seen
this
stuff
in
four
packs
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
lot
going
on
but
is
not
one
of
the
best
saisons
out
there
the
finish
is
disapointing
and
loses
a
lot
of
the
complexity
aroma
is
great
and
appearance
is
perfect
but
just
dosnt
come
all
together
like
some
if
you
like
this
try
the
fantome
automn
it
has
the
same
smoth
malt
bas
and
spicy
complexity
but
just
works
better
and
all
blends
dupont
pipax
fantome
pizza
port
all
much
better
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
despite
the
zesty
high
carbonation
it
is
a
tradition
in
my
family
to
bring
a
bottle
of
wine
to
the
thanksgiving
dinner
for
all
to
sample
but
i
think
this
year
i
will
surprise
them
all
with
a
couple
of
750
ml
bottles
of
this
i
am
sure
that
they
will
enjoy
it
and
if
you
have
yet
to
taste
this
great
beer
you
will
probably
enjoy
it
too
to
put
it
simple
ommegang
is
one
hell
of
a
brewery
this
nectar
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
slight
head
and
good
lace
along
the
glass
the
scent
is
somewhat
of
a
fruity
one
but
not
overly
sweet
like
some
belgians
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
more
toward
the
malty
side
imo
and
it
sits
well
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
anyone
i
think
this
is
the
one
i
would
choose
for
the
uneducated
beer
drinker
to
start
with
it
wont
scare
them
off
and
we
ba
can
enjoy
it
also
i
didnt
think
they
could
beat
ommegan
but
i
think
i
loke
this
one
better
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
them

table

happened
to
me
the
bouquet

of

alcohol
up

and
a
yeasty
spiciness
which
rounds
out
to
reveal

some
slight

bitterness
that
surfaces
towards
the
end
intense

a
decent

down
the
glass
huge
bubblegum
banana
and
other
lighter
fruits
and
spicy
pepper
dominate
the
smell
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
great
light
fruity
flavors
that
is
mostly
dominated
by
banana
with
some
possible
peach
and
orange
about
half
way
through
the
brew
gets
nicely
spicy
with
some
good
peppery
qualities
to
it
excellently
creamy
and
smooth
but
also
fairly
refreshing
and
excelently
drinkable
with
a
medium
body
to
it
this
is
one
damn
fine
brew
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more

and
balances
nicely
with
the
spicy
and
ohsobitter
finish
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
4
50
for
750ml
in
indianapolis
this
brew
is
a
chill
hazed
golden
and
throws
out
a
big
pufffy
white
head
that
has
nice
retention
pretty
sweet
aroma
with
this
one
honey
like
almost
like
a
braggot
or
that
midas
touch
brew
theres
also
some
fruity
esters
perceived
on
the
nose
maybe
some
slight
herbalness
too
nice
aroma
now
this
is
a
style
of
belgian
beers
i
can
get
into
this
is
really
nice
tasting
it
is
sweet
but
kept
in
check
with
the
hops
herbs
and
spices
which
i
will
only
try
to
take
a
stab
at
there
could
be
something
like
rosemary
or
marjoram
throwing
some
pizzaz
into
this
brew
i
like
it
whatever
it
is
this
brew
really
has
a
nice
earthiness
to
it
very
unique
taste
but
very
drinkable
honey
also
seems
to
be
perceived
on
the
tongue
this

upfront
and

by

but
refreshing
hop
bitterness
a
light
sweetness
persists
throughout
this
brew
and
seems
to
be
the
foundation
for
other
flavors
to
build
upon
candied
fruit
honey
pear
notes
all
intermingle
in

fashion
the

to
the

refreshing
nature
of
this
brew
finishes
bittersweet
w
a
mellow
lingering

is

perhaps

dangerous

with

there
is

also

on
the
tongue
great
mouth
very
sharp
tasting
also
on
the
tongue
lots
of
complexity
in
the

this
would
make
a
great
starter
with

and
fruit

and
very
nice
bittering
at
the
end
pretty
reserved
and
yet
nice
tasting
its
hard
to
call
a
belgian
a
session
brew
to
me
but
this
one
would
be
for
me
solid
in
most
categories
this
beer
poured
out
a
nice
golden
color
it
formed
a
nice
white
head
with
some
lace
on
the
side
later
on
the
aroma
of
smelled
of
malts
and
cirtus
good
level
of
carbination
to
this
beer
due
to
that
the
initial
mouthfeel
taste
of
it
throws
me
off
a
little
but
it
sudsides
after
the
next
taste
or
so
hides
its
alcohol
content
well
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
all
starts
when
you
pop
the
cork
from
the
bottle
a
nice
loud
pop
almost
like
a
champagne
the
beer
pours
to
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
solid
head
retention
with
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
smell
is
lightly
fruity
and
spicy
filled
with
sweet
apple
pepper
hops
and
yeast
flavor
is
rich
and
strong
with
the
flavors
hinted
at
in
the
aroma
i
also
notice
a
bit
of
citrus
flavor
meshing
with
the
apple
lively
continual
carbonation
give
the
brew
a
bit
of
zest
but
not
too
much
as
to
make
it
seem
acidic
on
the
tongue
wonderful
brew
and
a
great
cost
effective
belgianstyle
ale
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
lively
carbonation
a
longlived
head
displays
ample
belgian
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
nose
is
light
malt
and
a
wee
bit
lemony
taste
is
again
light
fruity
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
coming
thru
close
your
eyes
and
youll
swear
this
beer
was
brewed
in
belgium
goes
great
with
wise
bbq
potato
chips
update
maybe
my
opinion
of
ommy
has
soured
but
this
is
not
the
beer
i
once
thought
aged
or
fresh
more
tart
than
memory
recalls
with
green
apples
and
citric
fruit
taking
the
fore
simplistic
light
peppery
and
doughbal
yeastiness
good
for
what
it
is
but
so
many
saisons
surpass
this
but
i
must
say
for
the
price
this
is
still
a
soild
belgoquaffer
tart
and
fruity
heavily
carbonated
obscenely
so
smells
wonderful
nice
deep
character
i
didnt
expect
anything
this
good
for
what
i
first
thought
was
a
knockoff
definatly
a
revisit
114
cheers
to
frank4sail
for
the
sample
notes
raw
and
complex
yet
oh
so
drinkable
impossible
to
tell
it
would
have
been
from
ny
in
a
blind
tasting
one
of
our
favourites
bring
a
couple
of
750
ml
bottles
to
the
dinner
party
and
see
if
this
sparks
anyones
interest
away
from
wine
a
pleasant
fruity
and
spicey
nose
extremely
carbonated
quite
the
spectacle

indeed
prost
cloudy
and
golden
with
lovely
white

that
sticks
around
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
initially
followed
by
a
bitteralcoholcarbonation
gangbang
bite
at
the
back
of
the
palate
and
into
the
nose
coupled
with
a
lingering
bitterness
with
a
slight
tartness
that
leaves
the
outsides
of
your
tongue
somewhat
numb
taste
is
very
similar
to
biere
de
garde
style
with
lots
of
spiciness
but
not
much
wineniness
very
reasonably
priced
for
the
quality
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
peppery
spice
probably
one
that
would
grow
on
me
after
a
few
more
bottles
to
get
to
know
the
beer
this
is
american
whoa
hennepin
is
the
best
american
approximation
of
a
saison
that
i
have
ever
had
slightly
cloudy
golden
brew
that
pours
a
big
white
head
fruity
sweetness
orange
lemon
balanced
by
a
good
hop
character
in
the
finish
and
at
a
little
over
four
bucks
for
750
ml
what
a
deal
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
such
a
smooth
light
taste
but
that
belgian
strength
and
sweetness
is
still
lingering
there
a
top
quality
beer
for
an
unbelievable
price
this
is
my
first
saison
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
this
beer
is
awesome
it
usually
takes
me
a
couple
of
beers
to
warm
up
to
a
style
but
i
liked
this
one
off
the
bat
are
all
saisons
this
complex
a
lighter
dryer
brew
than
the
ommegang
but
no
less
complex
lemon
orange
zest
spicey
finish
there
plenty
going
on
with
each
swallow
of
this
outstanding
beer
fantastic
beer
has
a
little
cidery
taste
but
it
works
job
well
done
boulevard
now
i
need
to
try
this
fresh
at
2
yrs
and
34
yrs
for
researchs
sake
beautiful
in
appearance
and
flavor
snappy
earth
flavors
with

if
you
find
this
buy
it

at
a
local
watering
hole
i
am
not
yet
a
big
fan
of
belgian
style
but
based
on
ratings
i
wanted
to
give
this
a
shot
i
have
to
admit
i
was
apprehensive
given
some
of
the
descriptions
of
it
tasking
like
funk
or
bandaid

what
makes

both
preceding

it
amazing

melding
with

easy

drink
and
flavourful
caught
in
the
magic
of
the
moment
by
this
great
ale
i
noted
the
allure
was
highlighted
by
the
ale
not
being
sour
though
a
combination
of
tart
and
sweetness
did
prevail
overall
a
great
bottle
as
a
peer
to
the
best
in
its

d
very
delicious
alcohol
hidden

d
not
overly
sour
or
tart
at
all
with
more
of
the
saison
characteristics
shining
through
than
the
brett
fruity
and
sweet
yet
fairly
complex
this
is
one
of
the
better

only
the

keeps
it
from
scoring

so
to

i
havent
been
in

this
is
the

that
eluded

as
the
second

finally
made
it
to

i
bought
a

i
now

im

the

will
fade
a
bit
while
the

imparts
more
funky
this
is
a
really
impressive
brettlaced
saison
the
brett
seems
to
just
add
to
whats
already
there
mild
spices
and
something
very
earthy
first
taste
reveals
a
real
array
of
flavors
big
bursts
of
orange
zest
and
lemon
come
through
along
with
a
dry

flavor
some
chalky

show
up
as
well
the
brett
presence
is
not
nearly
as
apparent
as
in
the
taste
as
it
is
in
the
smell
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
is
amazing
it
really
scrubs
the
palate
like
no
other
beer
i
have
had
m
d
actually
less
funky
in
the
flavor
than
i
expected
from
the
smell
there
is
a
strong
lemon
zest
i
may
be
somewhat

a

mesh
with

this

surprisingly
it
doesnt

just
a

that

suffer

the

only

can
provide
the

is
very
beautiful
it
is
so
complex
and
so
strong
that
i
find

losing

is

this

sorry
i

not

tank

has
won
me
absolutely

fresh
will
definitely
be
buying
again
very

a
pleasant
surprise
found
at

very

highly

pleasant
and

for

overall
a
good
farmhouse
ale
nice
balance
and
a
smooth
crisp
feel
this
slid
across
the
tongue
with
almost
no
carbonation
a
light
to
medium
body
and
a
nice
sweetness
from
the
overall
complexities
in
the
brew
that
minimized
the
farmhouse
elements
and
brought
the
fruity
notes
up
front
boulevard
just
started
to
get
distributed
in
ny
and
i
looked
forward
to
trying
this
and
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
will
definitely
have
again

this
beer
made
boulevard
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
great
saison
true
to
the
belgian
style
but
has
a
hint
of
american
hops
i
would
rate
this
higher
but
it
is
a
tad
boozy
for
a
style
that
i
think
should
be
more
sessionable
o
an
excellent

its

this
stands
with
any
of
the
best

o
a
superb

this

is
hit
and
miss
for
me
but
tank
7
is
the
standard
bearer
for
me
favorite
farmhouse
ale
of
all
time
thats
an
example
of
a
farmhouse
saison
o
very
nice
american
version
of
a
saison
i
like
to
see
interpretations
of
this
style
instead
of
reproduction
of
the
classics
and
this
one
did
it
well
nice

with
a

overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
this
style
has
so
much
variability
im
not
sure
what
is
normal
so
i
cant
really
comment
on
its
appropriateness
for
the

lots

this

has
enough
going

the

got
emptier

pours
a

finally
settles
down

so
the

of
lots
of

yeast
floral
with
some

more
going

with
the
taste
as
the
sweet
floral

is
right
up

for
the

actually
goes
down
easy
with
no

with
good

one
of
the
better
farmhouse
ale
style
brews
i
have
had
since
they
seen
to
be
not
as
good
as
this
one
one
of
the
best
u
s
made
saisons
not
made
in
greensboro
bend
vt
a
classic
for
good
reasons
tasty
beer
no
doubt
about
it
drank
it
alongside
one
of
the
best
burgers
of
my
life
at
pen
and
quill
in
bmore
and
it
was
amazing
two
thumbs
up
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
will
buy
when
available
overall
tank
7
is
an
intensely
satisfying
beer
ive
only
said
this
about
a
handful
of
beers
in
the
past
but
this
is
one
that
is
truly
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
every
time
i
reach
for
this
beer
i
am
happy
i
did
it
may
not
be
the
most
rare
highest
abv
barrelaged
hoppiest
thing
in
the
world
but
it
oozes
class
and
consistency
i
know
that
it
will
be
great
every
time
yet
it
still
surprises
me
each
time
i
reach
for
it
this
is
one
of
the
timeless
classics
of
the
american
craft
beer
movement
long
live
tank

a
quintessential
saison
hits
all
the
read
notes
with
the
bready
earthy
malt
and
the
dry
fruit
mostly
citrus
in
this
instance
great
mouthfeel
crisp
medium

pretty

a

take
on
the

extremely
complex

is

hidden
be
careful
great
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
boulevard
has
hit
eastern
oh
and
by
default
western
pa
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
poured
a
golden
amber
into
my
tulip
two
fingers
of
glorious
white
head
that
hung
around
for
quite
a
while
this
has
a
big
bready
nose
with
a
nice
spicy
note
coriander
i
would
imagine
the
yeast
is
also
very
present
and
accounted
for
as
the
glass
warmed
a
bit
some
nice
mango
notes
began
to
break
out
the
flavor
was
awesome
big
strong
bready
backbone
was
supporting
a
tropical
fruit
medley
spicy
notes
from
the
yeast
and
just
an
overall
clean
presentation
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
definitely
coated
the
palate
and
lingered
a
moment
with
a
funky
little
punch
that
let
you
know
you
were
drinking
it
nothing
else
to
say
except
that
this
came
together
into
a
fantastic
beer
get
it
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
pours
beautifully
a
hazy
gold
very
fruity
floral
aroma
taste
is
that
of
hops
and
clove
with
fresh
citrus
fruit
mixed
in
overall
this
was
an
extremely
pleasant
experience
the
body
is
as
light
and
fluffy
as
the
head
but
not
insubstantial
its
dry
but
creamy
with
the
juiciness
cutting
the
dry
edge
just
enough
the
finish
lingers
gently
with
some
herb
and
spiciness
crispness
is
even
and
bites
just
a
little
all
the
way
through
boulevard
just
started
distributing
to
nj
and
this
is
making
a
great
first
impression
this
will
be
a
regular
saison
in
my
rotation
far
more
complex
than
most
examples
of
the
style
ive
tried
of
late
love
the
fruity
character
the
yeast
provides
the
finish
is
more
peppery
bitter
than
id
prefer
o
really
good
farmhouse
ale
would
go
real
nice
in
warm
weather
by
the
grill
need
to
be
careful
though
as
goes
down
way
to
easy
for
the
abv
a
decent
belgian
ale
not
a
fan
but
worth
a
try
massive
fluffy
head
with
loads
of
lace
smell
and
flavors
are
huge
and
fruity
with
yeasty
esters
noticeable
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
good
complexity
feel
is
beautiful
like
a
belgian
style
beer
should
be
a
top
notch
beer
for
the
style
an
american
made
saison
that
stands
up
to
the
ones
made
in
belgium
not
my
favorite
beer
by
far
golden
color
with
good
amount
of
bubbles
semi
fruity
smell
taste
has
some
banana
to
it
overall
a
good
beer
reminds
me
of
drunk
monk
by
3floyds
fruity
saisony
hoppy
one
of
the
best
modern
takes
on
a
classic
i
could
drink
this
any
time
of
the
year
the
finish
is
quite
crisp
a
bit
dry
and
leaves
you
with
a
lemon
tartness
and
flavor
over
an
ever
so
subtle
funk
this
is
a
great
brew
boulevard
really
seems
to
know
what
theyre
doing
with
these
styles
well
executed
recommended
grapefruity
goodness
but
i
typically
like
my
beers
less
sour
overall
a
great
saison
clean
crisp
taste
with
yeasty
flavors
and
dry
finish
fantastic
beer
my
new
favorite
bottled
102214
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
hazy
golden
yellow
color
took
about
10
minutes
to
pour
a
12
oz
bottle
because
of
the
great
head
of
white
fluffy
billowing
foam
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
was
a
bit
funky
piney
and
fruity
the
taste
had
some
lemony
peppery
and
spice
notes
with
just
a
tinge
of
malty
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
somewhat
dry
with
crisp
carbonation
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
just
love
this
beer
lemony
funky
nose
gives
away
some
of
what
is
to
come
next
a
big
earthy
farmhouse
ale
that
looks
and
tastes
excellent
lots
of
carbonation
and
an
unfiltered
view
from
the
glass
there
is
a
punchy
brightness
that
makes
this
a
perfect
beer
to
accompany
a
meal
should
you
be
so
inclined
hops
hold
up
well

an
great
malt
backbone
carb
level
keeps
the
sips
nice
and
interesting
while
providing
a
lush
body
solid
though
nothing
stands
out
as
a
unique
take
on
a
saison
as
a
non
saison
fan
this
beer
has
been
consumed
by
me
a
number
of
times
favorite
farmhouse
because
of
the
balance
and
character
it
reveals
in
the
mouth
and
going
down
rich
and
spicy
and
walks
the
line
between
golden
and
saison
o
its
very
drinkable
ive
never
been
crazy
about
saisons
but
this
isnt
bad
its
nicely
balanced
way
stronger
than
it
tastes
a
wheat
apa
with
a
kick
smell
didnt
do
it
for
me
awesome
color
and
smooth
but
overall
not
feeling
the
beer
overall
maybe
just
an
off
day
didnt
truly
care
for
love
other
boulevard
beers
not
this
one
though
great
farmhouse
beer
with
an
incredible
amount
of
head
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
large
white
lasting
head
aroma
is
of
citrus
pine
some
ripe
fruit
yeast
and
pale
malt
taste
same
as
aroma
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
citrus
floral
hops
bitterness
a
medium
body
on
the
palate
good
lively
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
citrus
and
fruity
mild
spicy
peppery
some
tart
notes
pale
malt
yeast
has
a
ripe
fruit
flavor
on
the
ending
with
a
slight
dry
bitterness
overall
a
good
full
flavored
saison
great
beer
i
dont
have
much
bad
to
say
about
it
would
defiantly
buy
again
amazing
saison
smells
of
lemon
belgian
yest
and
fruit
notes
taste
is
heavy
on
the
lemon
grapefruit
and
belgian
yest
with
a
little
bit
of
that
saison
pepper
more
thirst
quenching
than
water
basically
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
boulevard
has
done
a
great
job
on
this
one
would
absolutely
seek
out
and
purchase
again
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
that
trails
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
smell
is
full
of
all
sorts
of
smells
grapefruit
hops
a
bit
of
wheat
some
spice
and
pepper
the
taste
was
just
as
complex
with
a
bright
start
with
hops
and
yeast
flavors
then
mellowing
to
banana
flavors
mixed
with
spice
and
pepper
for
a
remarkably
clean
finish
absolutely
loved
this
one
the
very
best
beer
ever
hands
down
best
farmhouse
ale
i
have
had
the
extra
hops
really
did
it
for
me
pour
is
hazy
yellow
to
straw
colored
aroma
is
spicy
floral
and
hops
with
malt
balance
taste
is
hay
like
with
spice
upfront
and
malt
with
hop
balance
and
mild
spice
in
the
middle
and
finish
with
herb
and
earth
notes
throughout
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
carbonation
to
cut
overall
a
wonderful
saison
and
a
beloved
offering
from
boulevard
solid
overall
boozy
aftertaste
serving
type
bottle
this
beer
strike
the
perfect
balance
between
traditional
saision
and
american
craft
beer
ingenuity
a
golden
amber
beer
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
light
tropical
fruit
flavors
american
style
dry
hopping
on
the
finish
with
some
black
pepper
spice
notes
pours
a
bubbly
four
finger
head
over
a
gorgeously
colored
hazy
yellow
gold
body
exquisite
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
overriding
impression
here
is
of
a
sort
of
hybrid
saison
one
that
has
certain
ipalike
qualities
floral
tropical
and
citrus
notes
and
a
consistent
spiciness
its
like
the
flip
of
a
belgian
ipa
rather
than
an
ipa
that
has
a
belgian
quality
to
it
its
a
belgiantype
farmhousesaison
with
an
ipa
quality
a
unique
beer
im
in
love
o
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
lots
of
bright
crisp
flavors
very
enjoyable

12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
full
throttle
bottles
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
with
two
fingers
of
dense
white
head
with
a
few
large
bubbles
here
and
there
that
lingers
massive
brussels
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
that
stays
a
long
time
golden
hued
and
slightly
cloudy
fruity
aroma
of
apple
biscuit
yeast
apricot
floral
hops
notes
nice
sweetness
up
front
that
stays
around
with
the
finish
that
also
has
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
little
acidity
moderate
carbonation
almost
fizzy
but
just
short
of
it
light
body
on
the
dry
side
long
finish
wow
its
like
im
in
belgium
o
tank
7
is
a
slightly
offbeat
version
of
a
saison
that
manages
to
stay
true
to
the
style
but
is
also
somehow
unique
wow
liked
this
beer
very
dry
with
a
nice
hoppy
almost
spicy
finish
i
did
not
know
its
8
5
percent
after
a
few
sips
i
can
feel
it
in
my
head
smooth
easy
drinking
and
very
pretty
in
a
glass
the
aroma
is
very
similar
to
what
i
was
getting
on
the
flavor
cheers
try
this
one
and
enjoy
overall
3
32
a
bit
disappointed
i
had
high
hopes
for
tank
7
ive
had
better
saisons
and
this
one
is
just
too
hoppy
and
too
heavy
on
the
burnt
alcohol
flavor
i
rechecked
the
bottle
after
i
poured
because
i
could
smell
the
alcohol
right
off
the
bat
yeah
8
5
is
right
its
giving
me
a
touch
of
heart
burn
the
flavor
is
there
but
the
alcohol
takes
it
over
pretty
forcefully
destroying
any
yeasty
goodness
it
may
have
yielded
ill
probably
not
have
this
again
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
what
ive
had
so
far
has
been
really
enjoyable
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
that
comes
from
a
brewery
i
am
liking
more
and
more
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
is
a
must
try
if
you
enjoy
this
style
sweet
fruity
spicy
and
bursting
with
grapefruit
and
citrus
aroma
almost
like
an
ipasaison
hybrid
highly
recommended
lived
up
to
the
hype
bright
golden
color
with
some
white
froth
pleasant
fruity
and
lightly
spicy
yeasty
aromas
grassy
herbaceous
hops
and
clean
light
crackery
malt
tastes
good
yeasty
fruity
almost
completely
dry
with
nice
lingering
noble
hops
flavor
and
slight
bitterness
terrific
balance
nice
freshness
good
length
its
nice
that
one
of
the
best
saisons
made
stateside
is
so
widely
available
an
excellent
saison
exactly
what
i
want
from
the
style
really
good
beer
o
a
solid
american
saison
offering
overall
this
is
one
very
nice
fruity
but
drier
and
nicely
flavor
blended
and
funked
brew
this
is
a
nice
saison
that
is
super
easy
to
drink
at
8
5
delicious
and
dangerously
good
overall
and
drinkability
overall
i
find
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
definitely
like
the
touch
added
by
including
some
american
hops
here
and
im
now
about
half
way
through
a
case
and
still
enjoying
the
tank
7
beer
every
bit
as
much
as
i
liked
the
first
bottle
plus
im
finding
a
growing
appreciation
for
the
complexity
of
the
beer
as
my
experience
with
it
grows
and
deepens
pours
a
clear
gold
with
big
fluffy
head
settles
to
a
dense
cap
spay
of
thick
foam
down
the
glass
smell
soapy
dried
pineapple
floral
spices
not
for
cooking
or
baking
but
some
bs
bathroom
smelly
crap
this
beer
smells
like
your
grandmothers
bathroom
if
you
were
eating
dried
pineapple
in
it
instead
of
whatever
youre
really
doing
taste
mirrors
the
nose
just
a
ton
of
spices
that
dont
mesh
dried
sweetened
pineapple
pilspale
overly
sweet
sticky
candy
finish
after
the
spices
fade
fruity
without
definition
overly
sweet
overly
spiced
phenolic
like
a
bpa
ratings
dont
compute
because
this
is
not
a
good
saison
overall
while
excellent
this
saison
would
easily
blend
in
with
the
higher
quality
pack
were
it
not
for
a
few
very
small
surprises
such
as
the
minty
taste
in
the
finish
for
fans
of
the
style
its
definitely
worth
having
for
others
it
may
feel
forgettable
as
it
fades
away
nto
the
fruit
and
spice
conglomeration
of
the
other
saisons
theyve
had
before
overall
wow
simply
a
great
beer
fantastic
flavors
the
booze
is
here
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
end
of
this
i
did
split
part
of
it
with
a
friend
i
could
feel
a
nice
gentle
amount
of
warming
take
hold
no
matter
this
was
great
stuff
and
a
treat
for
those
of
us
here
on
the
east
coast
who
are
new
to
boulevard
good
enough
to
be
confused
with
an
import
and
simple
enough
for
anyone
to
enjoy
this
is
what
a
good
saison
should
be
about
the
aroma
wasnt
anything
memorable
but
everything
else
was
and
ill
probably
give
this
a
go
again
sometime
soon
in
the
near
future
after
hearing
much
about
it
i
finally
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
this
now
that
boulevard
is
being
distributed
in
nj
paired
excellently
with
a
thai
massamun
curry
dish
i
was
eating
will
definitely
purchase
again
and
a
beer
worthy
of
keeping
stocked
in
your
fridge
at
all
times
overall
really
good
hoppy
saison
not
worth
going
to
great
lengths
to
get
but
definitely
with
picking
up
if
you
come
across
it
tasted
just
like
bubble
gum
o
a
solid
offering
of
an
american
made
farmhouse
ale
that
offers
a
classic
belgian
aroma
and
flavor
with
letting
you
explore
the
real
creativity
of
boulevard
s
yeast
id
drink
this
again
definitely
a
good
offering
simply
perfection
o
a
pleasant
saison
some
may
be
put
off
by
the
strong
peppery
finish
but
i
found
it
quite
satisfying
not
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
but
still
another
quality
offering
from
boulevard
light
and
clear
fruity
and
spicy
saison
peppery
finish
lingers
nicely
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
what
a
saison
should
be
the
taste
is
dry
and
tart
with
some
pale
malts
and
yeast
but
starts
out
sweet
then
bitter
good
really
an
awesome
beer
super
hoppy
yet
not
bitter
fuity
dry
its
really
wonderful
o
overall
pretty
tasty
i
like
the
hopped
up
version
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
little
buzzkillington
if
you
are
looking
for
a
more
traditional
saison
juicy
and
tropical
yet
it
still
keeps
its
rustic
appeal
absolutely
phenomenal
saison
o
good
into
to
a
saison
kind
of
muted
but
extremely
drinkable
will
buy
again
aroma
is
nice
with
a
crisp
start
mild
refreshing
citrus
to
taste
fully
dry
finish
this
beer
has
great
aroma
of
citrus
piney
hops
yeast
funklove
it
anything
with
these
attributes
shows
a
great
craft
towards
oldworld
style
and
the
best
part
it
is
available
year
round
at
reasonable
4pk
prices
instead
of
uneconomical
bombers
im
addicted
to
this
beer
right
now
i
have
been
working
myself
out
of
an
ipa
rut
and
this
beer
is
a
great
step
away
taste
incredible
depth
and
balance
to
this
beer
it
does
not
fizzle
out
like
many
american
attempts
at
this
style
this
is
a
fullbodied
crisp
and
refreshing
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
and
definitely
a
world
class
example
of
the
style
boulevard
has
impressed
me
with
their
consistency
and
portfolio
as
a
whole
close
to
a
medium
body
thats
a
bit
off
not
a
fan
def
not
a
93
in
my
honest
opinion
cheers
i
havent
had
this
for
a
while
because
i
usually
dont
buy
largeformat
or
4packs
that
exceed
10
but
hey
4packs
on
sale
today
the
first
time
i
had
this
my
wife
and
i
were
in
the
mountains
for
a
wedding
during
the
summer
the
whole
town
shut
down
at
8pm
and
all
we
had
was
a
frozen
pizza
and
a
750
of
tank
7
and
it
was
an
excellent
dinner
im
no
less
impressed
by
boulevards
legendary
farmhouse
tonight
lovely
soft
haze
pineapplemeat
yellow
and
an
airy
head
make
this
ale
look
as
appetizing
as
it
tastes
the
nose
is
really
so
complex
its
hard
for
me
to
sort
out
but
i
get
a
lot
of
tropical
mangofruit
and
floral
notes
and
the
spiciness
just
gives
it
that
extra
edge
over
a
lot
of
others
assertive
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
nice
carbonation
and
bordering
on
thick
alcohol
is
apparent
in
flavor
numbs
the
tongue
and
takes
your
breath
away
a
little
at
first
wouldnt
call
this
beer
hot
though
tropical
and
light
citrus
fruits
notably
lemon
play
against
a
spicy
backdrop
really
nice
beer
and
three
left
o
bought
this
beer
in
a
build
ur
own
four
pack
and
so
far
it
is
my
favorite
this
beer
is
a
must
drink
get
it
o
love
this
beer
ive
finally
reviewed
it
after
the
50th
time
ive
tried
it
great
beer
and
worth
the
four
pack
although
im
drinking
it
on
tap
right
meow
bottle
as
an
extra
in
trade
forget
who
thanks
ive
had
this
sitting
for
a
bit
so
im
9
days
past
the
best
by
date
didnt
seem
to
matter
this
was
good
stuff
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
massive
fluffy
whir
head
aroma
of
hay
yeasties
barnyard
very
straight
forward
flavor
is
very
nice
and
refreshing
yeast
hay
dusty
barnyard
but
balanced
out
by
a
bit
of
honey
fruit
esters
pears
apples
and
a
bit
of
light
spice
light
bodied
and
high
carbonation
a
really
awesome
beer
here
easily
my
favorite
from
boulevard
this
saison
swings
more
toward
the
french
style
greater
clarity
than
the
belgian
type
good
bitterness
perhaps
about
50
to
60
ibus
with
a
mild
goldings
nose
and
some
more
citrusy
type
of
hop
like
columbus
good
hop
complement
to
the
more
orange
citrus
profile
of
what
im
guessing
is
a
french
saison
yeast
like
wyeast
3711
sweet
start
and
sweet
finish
no
tartness
or
barnyard
funk
saved
from
stickiness
by
the
high
bitterness
levels
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
thick
longlasting
head
generally
refreshing
as
a
strong
french
saison
should
be
o
lovely
beer
a
top
notch
brew
wish
i
had
tried
it
fresh
on
draft
at
the
brewery
a
staple
to
add
to
your
rotation
of
strong
ales
no
overpowering
flavors
predominately
hops
and
sweet
peppers
no
bad
aftertaste
slight
bitterness
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
a
thick
beer
a
on
draft
served
from
a
growler
overall
great
farmhouse
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
and
while
it
may
not
look
like
the
farmhouse
ales
ive
tasted
before
it
is
really
great
tasting
and
refreshing
o
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
farm
house
style
it
was
exactly
what
i
would
expect
of
the
style
but
didnt
blow
me
away
poured
into
my
trusty
ommegang
glass
2
finger
thick
head
smell
was
floral
and
sweet
first
sip
was
bubbles
with
a
quick
taste
of
the
typical
belgian
style
but
not
overwhelming
pleasant
and
drinkable
but
i
was
very
thirsty
at
the
moment
a
nice
change
for
me
since
i
am
mostly
into
ipas
i
would
bye
again
and
would
love
to
try
on
tap
at
some
time
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
american
saison
get
some
by
far
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
prefer
it
on
tap
i
love
the
boulevard
glass
its
poured
in
always
great
its
good
in
a
bottle
when
i
want
it
at
home
its
aroma
is
fresh
and
the
taste
lingers
on
my
tongue
for
minutes
this
beer
is
a
favorite
at
most
local
bars
and
pubs
for
a
very
good
reason
an
excellent
saison
farmhouse
ale
despite
being
on
the
highend
of
the
abv
scale
would
definitely
seek
out
again
as
expected
pairs
great
with
washedrind
cheeses
i
wavered
between
an
overall
rating
of
3
75
and
4
00
but
the
latter
got
the
nod
the
smell
was
fantastic
d
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
i
hate
ivs
but
id
take
an
iv
of
this
in
a
heartbeat
world
class
in
most
facets
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
brew
and
will
load
up
on
it
every
chance
that
i
get
i
will
go
further
then
recommended
and
state
that
this
is
a
brew
that
all
bas
should
experience
at
least
once
this
beer
rocked
my
world
and
you
should
give
it
a
chance
to
rock
yours
would
have
again
worth
finding
a
bottle
of
tank
7
is
one
tasty
farmhouse
ale
boulevard
continues
to
impress
cheers
really
impressed
with
this
farmhousestyle
ale
and
am
happy
to
know
it
is
distributed
in
the
area
id
love
to
drink
this
with
a
cheese
plate
and
fruit
o
this
is
a
great
kansas
beer
nice
example
of
farmhouse
ale
style
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
but
not
the
best
ive
had
solid
but
not
spectacular
boulevard
is
an
excellent
brewery
and
ill
be
trying
more
soon
overall
not
the
best
farmhouse
that
ive
had
but
its
very
good
im
a
sucker
for
this
style
these
days
and
this
implementation
of
it
is
solid

pours
a
clear
gold
from
the
tap
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
hay
and
fruit
apple
pear
and
grass
come
through
nicely
with
a
bit
of
malt
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
i
think
it
was
probably
a
bit
too
cold
but
was
really
nice
as
poured
very
refreshing
very
nice
saison
this
beer
should
be
served
at
a
slightly
higher
temprature
than
you
would
the
normal
lager
beers
this
allows
the
fruity
flavors
to
come
forward
there
is
also
a
slight
hop
aroma
to
this
beer
and
served
cool
it
is
easier
to
notice
the
main
aroma
are
complex
some
fruits
and
bananas
but
also
a
spicy
note
the
taste
is
dry
you
get
some
of
the
fruitiness
the
body
is
very
light
easy
to
dring
despite
being
8
5
abv
part
of
me
loves
that
fact
that
this
beer
is
8
5
abv
but
part
of
me
wishes
it
were
only
half
that
amount
so
i
could
drink
more
at
my
favorite
pub
o
again
pour
slowly
for
maximum
taste
a
great
saison
recommended
ive
had
this
beer
before
but
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
until
now
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
this
style
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
tastes
exactly
like
what
i
expected
this
and
hennepin
are
my
favorite
examples
of
this
style
if
you
like
a
good
farmhouse
ale
give
this
one
a
try
well
worth
it
will
be
buying
this
again
8
99
for
22oz
i
love
boulevards
beers
and
i
know
they
have
great
beers
so
ill
try
to
be
as
nice
as
i
can
about
this
beer
ok
where
to
start
i
bought
this
beer
for
11
99
for
a
4
pack
yes
a
4
pack
so
i
was
thinking
what
anyone
would
think
this
must
be
great
beer
that
assumption
was
wrong
tbh
i
flat
out
didnt
like
this
beer
which
almost
never
happens
first
of
all
its
way
overpriced
it
doesnt
go
down
smooth
it
doesnt
taste
good
it
doesnt
smell
good
and
it
barely
even
tastes
like
beer
i
think
the
brewers
were
already
drunk
when
they
made
this
brew
because
its
nothing
like
the
other
boulevard
brews
which
are
great
it
reminded
me
of
beer
made
out
of
hay
or
straw
that
someone
spiked
with
some
vodka
literally
the
only
reason
i
think
it
says
farmhouse
ale
is
because
it
tastes
like
a
cow
brewed
it
as
a
diehard
boulevard
fan
i
am
somewhat
upset
with
this
brew
especially
at
11
99
a
4
pack
kind
of
feeling
ripped
off
im
surprised
boulevard
even
releases
this
and
even
more
surprised
with
its
high
ratings
here
maybe
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
but
i
couldnt
find
one
quality
about
the
beer
i
liked
except
for
the
label
if
you
like
to
spike
your
beers
with
hay
and
vodka
this
beers
for
you
o
an
excellant
farmhouse
ale
very
drinkable
with
lots
of
flavor
o
lived
up
to
expectations
for
me
as
a
very
good
farmhouse
saison
would
definitely
recommend
o
this
beer
is
a
continual
favorite
it
is
sweet
fresh
and
inviting
it
is
lush
but
gentle
it
is
a
complete
sensory
experience
it
smells
as
good
as
looks
and
tastes
better
this
is
easily
one
of
the
top
3
beers
ive
ever
quaffed
othis
beer
is
one
of
my
longtime
favorites
and
i
am
glad
that
i
finally
got
around
to
giving
it
a
review
the
flavor
is
certainly
on
the
sweet
side
which
im
ok
with
but
those
who
like
things
dryer
may
not
appreciate
this
brew
as
much
as
i
do
aroma
and
appearance
are
definite
high
points
for
me
oawesome
farmhouse
ale
by
boulevard
must
try
some
the
other
smokestack
had
some
taleggio
cheese
paired
with
it
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bitter
and
very
dry
o
wow
such
beer
many
ale
so
taste
wow
this
beer
does
not
stop
with
its
refreshing
fruit
notes
with
a
tinge
of
sweetness
and
then
that
drying
on
the
finish
it
combines
to
be
an
extremely
well
crafted
saison
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
this
won
over
hennepin
in
a
blind
tasting
i
poured
it
into
a
frosty
widemouthed
glass
the
head
is
significant
it
sits
up
like
whipped
egg
whites
and
laced
the
glass
very
nicely
the
color
is
amberorange
and
somewhat
cloudy
it
has
a
dry
yeasty
smell
and
sort
of
ends
there
theres
almost
no
other
scent
of
note
past
that
imo
initially
i
thought
i
was
tasting
an
alcoholsoaked
clementine
poked
with
coriander
or
peppercorns
but
a
few
sips
in
realizedas
described
by
othersit
was
more
grapefruit
overall
it
feels
snappy
and
a
bit
metallic
with
a
balanced
carbonation
and
some
gentle
spice
in
the
mix
overall
id
say
its
definitely
a
precise
and
almost
medicinal
beer
perfectly
suited
to
a
warm
early
autumn
day
after
youve
toiled
at
whatever
one
ought
to
do
to
deserve
this
refined
beverage
its
a
well
made
saison
but
im
not
sure
id
give
it
world
class
status
overall
a
very
good
saison
i
like
a
bit
more
funk
but
this
is
a
solid
take
on
the
style
o
this
has
become
one
of
my
goto
beers
an
ale
i
like
to
keep
in
my
stock
for
those
times
when
i
want
a
farmhouse
ale
delicious
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
and
would
definitely
go
toe
to
toe
with
some
of
the
big
name
saisons
overall
its
alright
awesome
head
but
the
smell
was
generic
and
bland
the
taste
was
a
little
different
but
not
very
outstanding
kind
of
an
ipa
with
the
belgian
yeast
i
tried
to
take
into
consideration
the
best
by
date
was
curious
about
this
brewery
heard
it
was
pretty
good
but
the
ab
took
over
so
curious
to
see
which
direction
it
takes
from
here
this
really
is
a
worldclass
farmhouse
ale
first
of
all
the
bottle
itself
is
really
beautiful
the
pour
was
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
2
finger
white
head
had
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
but
still
refreshing
malty
backbone
with
a
little
floral
component
there
really
is
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
one
o
this
is
a
really
good
unique
take
on
a
saison
its
unabashedly
hoppy
but
it
retains
the
trademarks
of
the
style
rather
well
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
on
par
in
presentation
with
any
hazy
foamtopped
belgian
or
german
classic
i
think
the
hoppiness
lends
a
somewhat
brash
mouthfeel
for
the
style
at
least
regardless
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
great
and
i
like
what
is
going
on
with
it
it
isnt
too
dry
or
overpowering
in
one
respect
compared
to
any
other
saison
attributes
nice
this
is
actually
my
first
farmhouse
ale
and
if
i
didnt
know
better
blind
review
i
would
have
thought
it
was
an
ipa
the
fruity
hoppy
aroma
was
superb
loved
it
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
lace
was
average
migher
than
avg
on
carbonation
that
first
sip
was
lively
hoppy
flavor
matched
the
aroma
moderate
bitterness
lingered
i
dont
have
any
others
ive
had
to
compare
but
overall
a
very
decent
ale
odifferant
and
good
beer
wonderful
beer
delicious
taste
smooth
and
worth
stocking
up
in
the
fridge
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
thick
white
head
good
lacing
aromas
of
tangerine
pepper
and
floral
notes
spicy
on
the
palate
black
pepper
and
bread
that
give
way
to
lemon
and
clove
very
dry
finish
light
bodied
with
effervescent
carbonation
overall
a
very
well
crafted
and
drinkable
saison
o
a
potent
notquiteipa
it
definitely
has
that
farmyard
muskymusty
funk
crossed
with
a
marzen
tank
7
has
always
been
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
8
5
is
unnoticeable
the
feel
is
that
of
some
of
the
worlds
best
the
bright
fruitiness
and
perfect
balance
also
bring
to
mind
some
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
made
versions
of
the
style
anyway
there
is
a
subtle
undertone
of
that
classic
belgian
yeast
flavor
throughout
this
beer
it
taste
kind
of
fruity
but
mostly
the
amarillo
hops
dominate
the
other
flavors
this
beer
is
really
tasty
and
refreshing
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
farmhouse
ale
because
i
dont
think
the
belgian
flavor
shines
through
clearly
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
great
beer
in
general
however
overall
a
nice
clean
fruity
and
peppery
ale
without
overdoing
any
one
flavor
really
liked
it
overall
a
truly
remarkable
experience
this
is
one
of
slightly
hoppier
saisons
i
have
come
across
the
ale
is
slick
balanced
and
refined
one
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
in
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
great
job
boulevard
damn
good
beer
tho
its
pushing
the
envelope
a
bit
bottle
opened
with
a
big
pop
at
a
good
temperature
and
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
fluffy
creamcolored
head
that
lasts
a
very
long
time
and
some
lace
color
is
very
slightly
hazy
yellow
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
dominated
by
lovely
fresh
hop
citrus
a
bit
of
resin
flavors
much
like
nose
with
again
hop
in
front
backed
with
some
malt
sweet
and
some
bitter
traditional
saison
characteristics
have
been
supplanted
by
the
hop
domination
bodycarbonation
are
excellent
finish
is
like
flavor
hop
strength
carries
thru
for
a
very
long
time
and
only
a
little
alcohol
warmth
great
drinking
beer
wish
we
could
get
it
locally
o
heard
great
things
and
this
was
expectedly
very
nice
will
return
with
some
good
food
o
solid
yet
underwhelming
saison
about
the
baseline
of
what
a
good
saison
is
very
no
frills
this
could
pair
up
with
a
variety
of
dishes
a
straw
coloured
ale
with
a
white
head
firm
bitterness
into
ipa
territory
with
some
alcohol
warming
the
aftertaste
has
some
mild
fruitiness
and
belgian
year
character
the
beer
is
effervescent
and
has
a
dry
mouthfeel
the
aroma
is
hoppy
mixed
with
belgian
yeast
a
very
refreshing
beer
overall
a
great
beer
thats
best
enjoyed
on
its
own
i
would
advise
against
trying
to
pair
this
brew
with
food
i
found
the
flavor
too
sweet
to
be
compatible
at
least
with
the
cheeses
i
paired
it
with
o
good
beer
but
i
am
thinking
the
13
99
i
paid
for
four
may
have
been
twice
what
it
is
worth
if
the
others
go
better
i
will
update
the
review
pours
like
youd
expect
from
a
farmhouse
light
color
with
tons
of
head
takes
several
pours
to
get
into
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
nice
can
really
pick
up
some
spice
in
this
one
the
taste
is
the
best
for
a
farmhouse
ive
ever
had
then
again
i
dont
drink
many
of
this
style
it
has
that
bit
of
tanginess
with
a
lot
of
the
spice
you
get
from
a
belgium
tripel
the
spice
does
linger
just
a
bit
but
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
grab
this
again
light
yellow
color
with
solid
carbonation
and
a
strong
billowy
head
smells
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
and
orange
wow
great
taste
the
grapefruit
comes
through
but
its
not
too
overpowering
its
just
enough
to
cover
up
the
boozy
taste
but
not
too
much
that
it
blows
your
taste
buds
off
very
drinkable
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
great
balance
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
at
sip
number
two
i
cant
wait
to
finish
it
o
a
great
example
of
the
belgian
saison
with
an
american
twist
on
the
hops
i
dont
know
if
boulevard
uses
american
hops
but
the
flavors
are
a
meld
of
our
hop
profiles
and
the
belgian
yeast
styles
a
good
combination
one
of
the
better
versions
of
this
style
done
in
the
us
o
this
is
a
wellmade
base
saison
theres
no
exciting
twist
like
brett
or
flavor
additions
but
the
quality
of
the
beer
comes
through
recommended
for
someone
who
wants
to
go
back
to
basics
with
an
accessible
example
in
a
convenient
bottle
size
o
8

is
well

all
in
all
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
you
are
a
farmhouse
ale
fan
passing
up
this
beer
would
be
a
big
mistake
must
try
o
not
bad
but
definitely
would
choose
other
more
traditional
saisons
farmhouse
ales
are
so
broad
that
two
excellent
beers
can
be
complete
opposites
and
although
this
doesnt
do
mutch
for
me
its
still
a
great
beer
and
worth
the
try
i
will
definitely
keep
buying
boulevard
summary
more
of
a
pale
ale
unbalanced
not
much
flavor
other
than
hops
im
glad
i
went
for
the
12
oz
bottle
not
the
bomber
im
really
disappointed
meh
this
is
a
pretty
good
saison
with
lots
of
citrusy
flavors
a
bit
more
substantial
than
most
in
this
style
due
to
higher
abv
but
it
still
drinks
well
it
does
have
a
pretty
fair
amount
of
carbonation
lots
of
bubbles
but
gets
better
and
easier
to
drink
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
still
a
tasty
brew
and
a
beer
you
should
try
if
you
like
saisons
overall
excellent
easy
drinking
high
abv
brew
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
really
good
i
was
a
little
disappointed
but
i
realize
that
it
is
past
its
prime
wonder
what
it
would
have
been
like
fresh
o
light
and
fresh
saison
good
flavors
o
i
will
be
repeating
this
this
first
one
was
one
that
my
son
gave
me
to
try
i
will
be
buying
more
overall
a
very
good
saison
i
generally
like
this
style
and
this
one
is
quite
nice
i
will
definitely
buy
again
if
you
like
farmhouse
ales
this
one
is
a
must
try
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
but
i
lean
toward
favoring
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
the
smelltaste
review
by
nsheehan
below
sums
it
up
nicely
but
here
is
my
review
initially
based
on
the
smell
i
lost
a
lot
of
excitment
for
this
beer
the
taste
then
helped
recover
the
experience
if
i
were
to
comparte
this
to
another
beer
it
would
be
the
left
hand
st
vrain
trippel
although
in
my
mind
it
would
be
the
higher
end
version
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
probably
have
again
but
glad
i
got
the
12oz
version
instead
of
the
bomber
i
hope
this
review
helps
you
otoo
much
in
the
way
of
flavors
that
just
didnt
mesh
well
together
ocertainly
a
high
quality
beer
but
with
all
the
funk
on
the
appearance
and
the
carbonation
level
i
see
it
more
as
wine
than
beer

o
very
fruity
refreshing
and
delicious
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
summer
brew
had
this
beer
as
the
first
of
a
tasting
on
a
100
degree
day
remarkably
easy
to
enjoy
while
maintaining
body
and
personality
could
have
more
bite
on
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
a
favorite
fabulous
with
a
6
year
old
manchego
and
dry
aged
salami
the
grapefruit
is
refreshing
o
this
is
a
topnotched
farmhousebelgianstyle
ale
good
amount
of
barn
house
funk
lots
of
bright
colors
and
flavors
a
great
beer
for
a
sunny
warm
day
my
major
let
down
was
the
boozy
lingering
taste
it
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
opens
so
i
prefer
the
12
oz
bottles
tank
7
pours
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
head
but
this
may
be
due
to
an
aggressive
pour
i
dont
remember
it
being
quite
this
lively
the
first
couple
of
times
around
the
color
of
this
brew
is
somewhere
between
golden
and
copper
with
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
throughout
the
liquid
again
probably
because
of
an
overly
aggressive
pour
the
scent
of
this
beer
comes
through
strong
in
the
humulus
arena
but
yeast
also
plays
a
starring
role
the
flavor
is
also
lots
and
lots
of
citrusy
hops
along
with
strong
notes
of
bubblegum
that
comes
straight
out
of
the
belgian
ipa
handbook
this
beer
is
not
playing
around
strong
flavors
all
around
dont
necessarily
make
a
beer
great
but
these
flavors
are
fantastic
i
cannot
wait
to
pop
open
my
bottle
of
saisonbrett
but
i
may
be
able
to
hold
of
for
a
few
months
to
let
it
develop
that
funk
i
think
i
would
really
love
in
this
brew
o
this
is
a
top
notch
saison
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
has
it
all
perfect
appearance
and
mouthfeel
huge
complex
aroma
big
flavor
profile
and
very
refreshing
bravo
boulevard
o
this
is
a
very
nice
saison
and
one
that
i
would
gladly
drink
over
and
over
again
wonderful
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
american
take
on
a
traditional
saison
overall
great
saison
nice
beer
for
year
round
drinking
i
have
seen
this
beer
in
stores
for
a
while
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
tried
it
excellent
stuff
well
done
boulevard
4
15
with
an
8
5
abv
this
is
really
a
tripel
the
ampedup
alcohol
must
explain
why
this
is
ranked
similarly
to
hennepin
i
dont
love
hennepin
but
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
than
this
light
bodied
and
drinkable
interesting
beer
or
maybe
the
style
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
to
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
gentle
foaming
sensation
on
the
palate
gradually
becoming
lightly
foamy
ethanol
can
be
felt
in
the
nostrils
and
back
of
throat
as
this
warms
somewhat
disappointing
slightly
languid
pleasant
overall
closes
semidry
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
poured
a
clearish
orange
with
good
sized
head
and
lace
on
top
of
a
slightly
yeasty
pepperspiced
ale
that
gives
off
some
light
tropical
and
sweet
notes
as
well
as
a
good
dose
of
citric
hops
the
beer
is
smooth
and
has
a
rather
filling
body
due
to
the
yeast
and
i
get
a
good
amount
of
plush
tropical
fruit
tastes
and
some
citric
hops
im
also
getting
touches
of
breadlike
and
sweet
malt
so
there
is
some
balance
in
this
beer
between
fruit
sweet
and
dryness
as
i
find
the
finish
to
be
dry
and
also
a
little
heat
thanks
to
the
alcohol
that
complements
finish
an
easy
to
drink
flavorful
saison
that
hits
all
the
notes
o
very
unique
beer
i
think
this
is
actually
my
first
farmhouse
ale
im
a
fan
really
pretty
beer
a
straw
yellow
that
flirts
with
pale
orange
big
rocky
head
smells
medicinal
in
a
strangely
good
way
belgian
yeast
notes
dominate
but
toasty
malt
pokes
through
a
little
alcohol
burn
tastes
great
big
surprisingly
bready
malt
sweetness
up
front
falls
nicely
into
the
hops
and
spicy
esters
a
touch
of
honey
lingers
not
overly
long
but
wonderfully
structured
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
but
we
are
at
8
5
so
its
not
completely
unexpected
really
very
tasty
but
maybe
not
as
crisp
as
you
might
be
expecting
from
a
farmhouse
ale
this
is
one
i
will
go
back
to
often
o
this
is
easily
a
favorite
outstanding
in
every
category
not
strictly
a
classic
belgian
farmhouse
saison
but
in
the
ballpark
and
standing
comfortably
on
its
own
very
easy
going
keeps
your
attention
with
interesting
things
when
you
want
stays
out
of
your
way
if
you
want
i
would
have
liked
something
else
to
stand
out
besides
grapefruit
only
thing
stopping
perfect
scores
good
saison
in
12oz
bottles
is
hard
to
find
pricey
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
here
4
pack
purchased
from
binnys
cloudy
appearance
ascending
from
yellow
to
orange
sharp
smell
of
yeast
spice
and
citrus
zest
obviously
not
as
funky
as
boulevards
saisonbrett
lots
of
grapefruit
flavor
as
well
as
all
the
features
you
love
in
a
saison
little
too
carbonated
for
my
tastes
but
all
the
flavors
are
so
good
its
easy
to
overlook
dry
finish
definitely
taste
the
8
5
abv
as
you
get
closer
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
d
this
is
a
different
sort
of
beer
for
me
not
sure
i
really
like
the
style
or
not
it
is
drinkable
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
pepper
taste
in
my
beer
will
need
to
try
other
beers
in
this
style
but
jury
is
out
for
my
appreciation
of
saisons
easy
drinking
dangerous
full
flavored
yet
smooth
sweet
and
spicy
lots
to
appreciate
hazy
straw
colored
in
appearance
a
half
inch
layer
of
foam
across
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
that
wonderful
belgian
yeast
strain
perhaps
a
bit
of
candy
sugar
in
the
scent
biscuity
malt
with
some
pine
like
pacific
hops
in
the
aftertaste
sort
of
european
style
meets
modern
american
brewing
moderate
thickness
on
the
mouthful
deceptively
smooth
for
the
strength
d
really
good
stuff
from
boulevard
here
definitely
one
of
their
staples
as
it
should
be
a
bit
of
a
bigger
saison
but
definitely
not
raw
or
undrinkable
pick
some
up
if
you
have
it
in
your
distro
overall
it
is
a
good
domestic
farmhouse
ale
i
havent
had
a
ton
but
it
is
a
solid
offering
and
when
my
palate
is
really
looking
for
some
funk
and
a
dry
finish
id
certainly
consider
buying
again
what
i
really
like
is
that
this
is
sold
in
a
4
pack
and
the
pricing
is
reasonable
saisons
are
wonderful
to
have
around
in
the
summer
months
and
it
just
seems
impractical
to
stock
a
bunch
of
bombers
so
i
applaud
boulevard
for
the
4
pack
format
ill
probably
continue
to
try
a
few
others
like
brooklyns
before
seeking
this
out
again
but
will
say
im
happy
to
have
3
more
in
the
fridge
and
could
see
myself
coming
back
for
more
at
some
point
get
one
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
while
sitting
out
on
my
deck
waiting
for
the
grill
to
heat
up
it
had
a
wonderful
combination
of
hops
yeast
and
appearance
in
many
cases
i
could
care
less
what
a
beer
looks
like
but
when
im
relaxing
out
on
my
porch
after
a
fairly
arduous
work
week
and
the
weather
is
fantastic
yeah
the
hazy
strawcolored
glow
really
added
to
my
enjoyment
overall
a
fairly
decent
saison
not
as
good
as
some
others
but
fairly
solid
for
what
can
be
found
in
4
packs
at
the
store
probably
going
to
be
a
new
go
to
beer
for
me
during
the
summertime
so
i
can
save
my
bigger
bottles
for
friends
the
smokestack
series
never
fails
to
impress
this
was
a
nicely
americanized
belgian
worth
keeping
your
eye
out
for
overall
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
my
only
gripe
is
that
the
herbal
peppery
component
at
midpalate
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
strong
and
disrupts
the
balance
of
the
beer
still
fans
of
traditional
farmhouse
ales
should
not
pass
this
up
if
they
see
it
its
a
winner
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
strong
citric
aroma
with
some
piney
hops
thrown
in
yeasty
malty
backbone
with
a
crisp
piney
hoppy
character
slightly
citric
aftertaste
but
mainly
a
strong
farmhouse
yeasty
funk
high
alcohol
content
is
evident
in
the
aftertaste
even
though
crisp
it
is
still
a
smooth
beer
very
unique
overall
the
abv
is
actually
a
little
bit
high
for
the
bjcp
guidelines
which
ranges
up
to
7
0
this
one
is
8
0
not
a
bad
thing
but
its
typical
of
american
breweries
to
bolster
every
ale
they
brew
i
would
love
this
beer
without
the
alcohol
burn
that
it
comes
with
but
even
with
that
i
really
really
like
it
cant
love
it
but
its
real
close
this
is
an
awesome
beer
for
hot
weather
as
far
as
an
example
of
the
style
its
acceptable
but
is
out
of
parameters
for
abv
im
going
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
big
ole
bottle
and
then
head
to
bed
with
a
quenched
thirst
and
a
spinning
head
tank
7
poured
a
hazy
bright
color
with
a
nice
large
white
lacing
head
the
aroma
has
alo
of
pepper
and
flower
notes
the
taste
has
strong
pepper
and
flowery
notes
strong
spice
notes
full
flavor
and
nice
feel
nice
carbonation
overall
found
the
tastes
a
bit
offensive
and
undrinkable
not
for
me
a
fantastic
light
beer
the
aroma
makes
you
think
this
beer
will
knock
you
off
your
feet
with
citrus
but
that
flavor
passes
quickly
and
mellows
a
nice
bitter
bite
at
the
end
reminds
you
of
the
high
abv
without
it
you
could
down
a
number
of
these
and
regret
it
later
this
is
really
sessionable
but
at
8
5
you
probably
dont
want
to
down
too
many
of
these
an
excellent
summer
beer
had
this
at
millers
ale
house
in
watertown
ma
light
smooth
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
its
a
very
balanced
beer
with
a
heavy
fruity
flavor
went
down
perfectly
on
a
hot
summer
night
it
goes
great
with
fresh
seafood
or
shellfish
paired
really
well
with
oysters
n
guess
what
like
said
lil
freak
that
raul
wishes
that
he
never
gave
up
raul
wants
this
lil
minx
to
come
out
to
play
again
sometime
soon
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
even
if
its
totally
a
hybrid
in
the
same
way
that
say
saison
rue
is
however
unlike
that
one
this
is
far
more
drinkable
the
fruitiness
is
really
refreshing
here
as
well
as
the
grassy
hops
and
crisp
grains
everything
works
out
well
except
for
my
lack
of
maintaining
sobriety
in
the
long
run
due
to
that
devilishly
hidden
abv
ill
be
seeking
out
more
beers
from
these
guys
in
the
future
overall
not
a
bad
saison
at
all
overall
very
tasty
and
balanced
saison
oan
exceptional
brew
my
favorite
saison
so
far
o
very
enjoyable
melding
of
a
diverse
range
and
number
of
flavors
paired
with
the
light
feel
this
is
one
impressive
saison
very
impressed
that
someone
made
something
so
light
yet
so
good
nice
job
overall
an
exceptional
farmhouse
brew
a
great
american
rendition
of
a
saison
scarily
drinkable
for
8
5
abv
a
nice
take
on
a
farmhouse
saison
like
ale
but
with
enough
good
tweaks
to
make
this
a
great
ale
highly
recommmended
overall
delicious
this
would
be
great
on
a
cold
crisp
morning
if
we
didnt
have
jobs
to
go
to
notes
nice
balanced
saison
hop
forward
so
itd
be
a
good
entré
for
hop
heads
to
the
style
more
earthy
and
somewhat
spicy
and
less
juicylivelyzesty
than
some
of
the
classics
out
there
but
perhaps
more
like
the
original
oldworld
style
very
nice
and
very
very
drinkable
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
or
maybe
just
in
the
mood
for
a
crisp
saison
either
way
i
would
highly
recommend
and
repurchase
if
i
find
again
in
the
future
my
second
smokestack
series
from
boulevard
both
have
been
excellent
o
i
really
love
saisons
extremely
complex
beers
that
are
wonderful
when
executed
properly
however
i
feel
like
the
yeast
were
too
predominant
in
this
beer
the
pepper
and
clove
overwhelmed
the
fruit
and
sour
flavors
i
enjoy
a
good
beer
nonetheless
spice
like
pepper
and
basil
that
creates
a
sweet
sensation
on
its
own
grapefruit
jolly
rancher
lightmedium
body
i
think
the
essence
of
a
saison
is
that
it
is
light
and
drinkable
im
afraid
this
is
not
nearly
light
enough
in
alcohol
flavor
etc
to
be
a
light
summer
drink
it
is
fairly
well
balanced
but
why
go
overboard
with
the
alcohol
somebody
explain
does
it
make
it
more
complex
somehow
belgian
saisons
and
lambics
accomplish
tremendous
complexity
while
still
being
light
and
refreshing
i
appreciate
subtlety
and
i
wish
american
brewers
would
start
using
more
of
it
overall
a
nice
saison
and
pretty
refreshing
for
8
though
thats
probably
dangerous

ensures
erect

through
the
finish
very
thoughtfully
put
together
while
not
overintellectualized
this
is
such
a
tasty
and
refreshing
saison
all
the
while
incorporating
some
juicy
tropical
fruit
notes
its
a
little
light
on
the
traditional
funk
and
belgian
characteristics
but
very
good
and
slightly
bitter
for
the
style
too
o
a
very
nice
american
take
on
a
complex
belgian
style
live
life
drink
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
drinks
a
little
flat
from
the
bottle
on
tap
where
the
carbonation
can
be
manipulated
it
can
be
an
almost
perfect
beer
o
fits
the
profile
of
a
saison
perfectly
not
the
style
of
beer
that
i
prefer
but
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
would
think
it
to
be
very
pleasing
for
a
more
farmhouse
person
got
the
4
pack
with
glass
for
half
off
definetely
worth
that
o
overall
im
impressed
i
think
its
appearance
is
this
beers
weakest
point
while
its
taste
is
its
strongest
things
i
liked
its
tropical
fruit
aroma
its
biscuitsour
ratio
and
its
spicy
notes
things
i
didnt
like
its
somewhat
simple
appearance
for
a
saison
also
i
personally
like
my
saisons
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
and
have
a
bit
more
of
a
yeast
flavor
than
this
one
possesses
if
i
were
to
improve
on
this
beer
id
add
some
more
honey
to
give
it
a
slightly
sweeter
flavor
and
also
keep
more
yeast
in
suspension
to
give
it
a
bit
more
body
overall
though
im
impressed
not
my
favorite
commercial
saison
that
belongs
to
funkwerks
but
id
say
its
in
my
top
5
o
one
of
the
first
that
ive
tried
of
the
style
very
good
fruity
notes
all
of
boulevards
smokestack
series
beers
have
been
awesome
o
a
nice
american
farmhouse
ale
with
good
crisp
flavors
and
solid
aromatics
a
mustdrink
in
the
summer
o
tank
7
is
blvds
flagship
beer
i
would
have
to
say
they
are
one
of
those
breweries
where
every
single
one
of
their
beers
shares
a
common
backbone
particularly
due
to
the
yeast
which
is
in
most
of
them
tank
7
to
me
is
their
best
wisely
available
beer
it
is
the
definition
of
a
saison
to
me
with
mabey
slightly
a
higher
hop
content
it
drinks
great
that
being
said
it
is
nothing
crazy
creative
or
innovative
but
hitting
a
style
so
right
on
deserves
just
as
high
praise
as
one
that
pushes
boundaries
this
is
a
beer
for
sipping
overall
its
a
really
great
saison
the
aggressive
hops
really
make
this
more
american
then
belgian
also
could
be
a
bit
drier
but
its
a
solid
brew
id
get
again
for
sure
overall
my
first
beer
from
this
brewer
and
its
a
winner
for
sure
the
scent
is
fantastic
and
the
appearance
is
spot
on
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
anytime
and
would
make
it
a
go
to
beer
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
three
finger
head
that
dissipates
fairly
slowly
and
leaves
lively
carbonation
smells
grass
belgian
yeast
little
funk
a
tiny
bit
of
lemon
or
lime
pepper
taste
starts
with
bright
flavors
of
lemon
and
grass
then
is
followed
in
the
middle
by
the
belgian
yeast
some
peppery
spice
slight
breadiness
then
the
finish
is
more
of
the
belgian
yeast
some
light
funkiness
some
light
citrus
notes
like
lemon
and
grapefruit
more
spiciness
some
slight
floral
notes
sweet
breadiness
from
the
malt
creamy
refreshing
mouthfeel
high
medium
body
this
was
supposed
to
be
drank
by
january
which
was
two
months
ago
still
in
pretty
good
shape
with
some
hop
qualities
but
im
sure
it
is
far
better
beer
fresh
not
too
bad
o
i
was
so
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
was
really
bitter
and
just
kept
getting
more
and
more
bitter
as
i
drank
it
the
grapefruit
is
nice
and
refreshing
but
the
hoppy
bitterness
overwhelms
any
other
tones
within
the
beer
i
will
not
be
buying
this
beer
again
overall
drinkability
a
very
good
american
belgian
overall
i
wouldnt
try
this
beer
again
it
was
way
to
sweet
and
candy
tasting
which
are
not
appealing
to
me
serving
type
bottle
overall
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
tried
and
i
am
happy
this
is
being
distributed
in
my
area
i
am
constantly
searching
for
new
and
interesting
brews
nevertheless
this
one
stands
up
to
most
of
the
ones
i
have
tried
and
would
recommend
this
one
for
sure
overall
my
second
favorite
saison
behind
saison
dupont
but
a
very
good
beer
overall
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
crisp
overall
i
think
its
a
great
american
representation
of
the
style
any
more
coriander
wouldve
been
too
much
for
me
as
this
is
a
problem
i
have
with
a
lot
of
belgians
but
its
pretty
spot
on
an
excellent
beer
id
love
to
find
it
on
tap
a
great
saison
at
8
i
could
see
that
getting
dangerous
with
how
easy
drinking
this
is
as
far
as
farmhousesaisons
made
in
the
us
this
is
on
par
with
hennepin
and
just
about
as
good
as
it
gets
im
still
completely
sold
by
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
as
i
just
dont
think
that
is
true
to
style
cant
serve
8
beer
as
a
refreshment
to
field
workers
theyd
pass
out
in
the
fields
after
lunch
but
the
flavor
cannot
be
denied
and
boulevard
has
at
least
resisted
overhopping
like
so
many
us
brewers
want
to
do
with
this
style
this
is
legitimate
stuff
from
the
funkyhorsey
aroma
when
you
open
it
to
the
slightly
peppery
finish
its
all
there
very
few
brewers
in
the
us
get
it
as
far
as
farmhouse
ales
go
these
guys
are
on
the
list
well
done
having
said
that
farmhousesaisons
are
not
for
everyone
if
you
dont
like
the
style
this
beer
probably
wont
change
your
mind
good
foam
and
color
ok
nose
taste
is
a
cross
between
a
belgium
ale
and
an
ipa
done
very
well
i
like
the
mix
of
the
floral
with
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
than
in
a
typical
belgium
ale
finish
is
very
long
starting
with
the
fortunately
not
too
sweat
malt
and
ending
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
bite
overall
a
very
good
and
refreshing
beer
complex
and
fairly
well
balanced
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
reminds
me
a
bit
of
duvel
a
favorful
beer
that
i
would
recommend
o
really
wonderful
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
some
time
now
and
im
glad
i
not
only
had
the
opportunity
but
i
have
another
one
to
enjoy
i
like
the
nose
on
the
tank
7
the
spice
and
yeastiness
are
nice
with
this
one
the
bouquet
balances
really
well
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
as
well
this
works
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
saison
o
great
saison
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
but
at
8
abv
common
sense
prevails
o
really
fine
job
with
excellent
balance
and
good
flavor
complexity
looks
smells
and
tastes
beautiful
it
says
farmhouse
but
closely
resembles
a
trippel
sneaky
strong
8
5
this
is
a
an
enjoyable
saison
worth
checking
out
verdict
a
really
pleasant
farmhouse
ale
from
boulevard
the
flavors
are
layered
bright
and
enjoyable
while
it
may
not
be
the
most
complex
and
exciting
farmhouse
ale
it
is
certainly
a
worthy
brew
for
anyone
who
loves
a
good
belgian
style
ale
o
this
is
a
fantastic
farmhousesaison
if
you
have
never
had
it
and
get
a
chance
to
grab
one
do
it
its
very
unlikely
that
you
will
regret
it
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
without
a
second
thought
overall
a
really
good
american
style
farmhouse
ale
good
mix
of
sweetness
spice
hops
and
citrus
fruit
esters
o
this
was
an
impressive
brew
very
tasty
would
grab
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
golden
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
forever
and
medium
thick
poofy
lacing
that
leaves
rings
on
the
glass
the
body
is
clear
but
for
a
slight
haze
and
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
steadily
working
their
way
up
the
glass
though
there
also
seems
to
be
some
very
small
particles
floating
in
the
beer
this
is
a
pretty
beer
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
wonderfully
citrusy
with
proper
bread
accentuations
peppery
lemon
comes
to
mind
when
trying
to
describe
it
the
smell
is
classic
saison
citrusspice
with
wonderful
bready
notes
and
the
slightest
touches
of
hay
and
farmyard
funk
and
even
light
banana
esters
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
much
more
herbal
and
grassy
than
the
nose
the
beer
begins
more
in
tune
with
the
nose
featuring
citrus
lemon
bread
that
washes
strongly
over
the
tongue
crescendoing
and
ebbing
backwards
as
a
solid
grassy
bitter
follows
it
bringing
herbal
tingling
to
the
mouth
and
washing
away
all
but
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
reminiscent
of
banana
esters
green
pepper
tastes
can
also
be
found
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
alongside
stronger
banana
notes
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
a
touch
off
sitting
just
below
medium
bodied
which
makes
it
highly
drinkable
but
not
quite
thin
enough
to
knock
back
and
not
quite
thick
enough
to
sip
it
feels
clean
and
creamy
as
it
goes
down
and
leaves
the
mouth
slightly
wet
with
a
light
herbal
dryness
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
in
tank
7
ive
heard
great
things
and
i
love
boulevards
saisonbrett
but
this
beer
doesnt
quite
marry
its
separate
flavors
in
an
appealing
way
for
me
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
think
i
built
it
up
a
little
bit
too
much
in
my
head
worth
a
try
for
the
belgian
lover
but
not
a
knock
out
in
my
book
o
its
great
to
be
reminded
that
not
every
great
beer
is
a
doublesuperelitelimitedreleasewalletdrainer
i
loved
this
one
and
can
go
out
and
buy
it
whenever
i
want
at
stores
all
across
the
country
grading
this
beer
was
hard
this
is
a
very
competitive
style
this
beer
was
is
just
shy
of
being
worldclass
compared
to
other
farmhouse
ales
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
end
of
a
long
day
or
any
day
really
a
beautiful
clear
golden
color
lots
of
bubbles
persevering
foam
crisp
carbonation
a
blend
of
sweet
and
pleasantly
acrid
flavors
in
the
background
not
much
to
complain
about
here
miraculous
either
a
freak
of
nature
or
most
likely
an
exquisitely
designed
brew
nevertheless
i
am
extremely
impressed
uitstekend
o
nice
saison
i
will
get
this
one
again
overall
one
of
favorite
saisonsfarmhouse
ales
a
great
craft
brew
from
a
great
craft
brewery
well
done
boulevard
o
a
good
saison
i
will
buythis
one
again
o
very
nice
o
wonderful
aroma
and
mouthfeel
but
the
overall
execution
of
the
flavor
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
wonder
if
im
becoming
too
critical
of
saison
entries
now
that
its
my
new
favorite
style
oh
well
o
this
is
a
really
strong
beer
for
the
style
while
different
than
most
belgians
this
uniqueness
is
its
strength
o
this
is
a
great
saison
i
may
prefer
this
over
their
saisonbrett
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
boulevard
mainly
due
to
their
mainstream
wheatbeer
popularity
but
this
beer
and
another
of
their
smokestack
series
are
really
excellent
will
definitely
buy
again
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
hop
character
isnt
exactly
traditional
but
very
good
overall
yea
i
likes
it
more
sweetness
and
a
more
balanced
taste
than
the
few
saisons
ive
had
this
750
ml
bottle
was
a
gift
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
saisons
or
farmhouse
ales
my
loss
this
beer
will
definitely
end
up
in
my
refrigerator
as
the
weather
warms
in
spring
o
is
this
a
saison
or
a
belgian
ipa
it
has
all
the
usual
saison
flavors
plus
a
huge
hoppy
profile
in
both
aromaflavor
it
is
very
similar
to
lagunitas
maximus
i
a
some
how
feel
like
a
sucker
for
rating
it
so
high
if
it
were
labeled
as
an
belgian
ipa
as
it
should
be
it
would
get
about
a
45
since
its
labeled
a
saisonfarmhouse
its
very
unique
and
glorious
that
i
must
give
it
this
rating
if
you
looking
for
an
example
of
the
style
this
isnt
it
if
your
looking
for
something
thats
straight
up
tasty
as
hell
grab
this
o
a
lovely
saison
and
one
im
happy
to
have
finally
found
in
california
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
o
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
saison
and
was
happy
to
try
another
offering
from
boulevard
brewing
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
zippy
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
an
overall
enjoyable
saison
the
beer
was
picked
as
a
part
of
the
4
bottle
sampler
pack
with
sweet
tulip
glass
packed
in
which
i
used
for
this
review
the
beer
looked
very
hazy
in
the
glass
with
a
three
finger
thick
head
and
a
golden
body
the
smell
deviated
from
the
saison
mold
quite
a
bit
due
to
the
use
of
grapefruit
like
american
hops
there
was
some
bubblegum
in
the
nose
which
i
suspect
was
the
yeast
the
taste
was
expertly
balanced
between
bold
and
delicate
flavors
there
was
a
noticeable
use
of
citric
hops
and
a
peppery
spiciness
but
there
was
also
a
floral
character
and
some
orange
peel
and
banana
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
airy
and
light
with
a
creamy
carbonation
this
was
one
of
the
best
american
interpretation
of
a
saison
ive
had
in
a
while
mostly
hazy
golden
yellow
under
a
properly
large
thick
fluffy
head
peppery
belgian
yeast
zesty
grapefruit
fruity
tartness
herbs
and
grass
quite
a
bit
hoppier
in
the
mouth
bright
spicy
juicy
citrus
working
very
well
with
the
yeast
dry
fruity
esters
subtle
pale
malt
sweetness
and
some
grassyflowery
hops
to
back
the
citrus
medium
bodied
and
remarkably
refreshing
for
its
strength
id
go
ahead
and
stick
this
one
in
the
belgian
ipa
category
bright
and
snappy
this
beer
pulls
off
the
hopyeast
balance
very
well
t
a
bit
of
a
peppery
hop
bite
comes
through
first
with
some
smooth
light
bready
malt
flavors
carrying
it
grapefruit
zest
a
touch
of
grass
chalky
yeast
and
a
smooth
finish
with
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
pepper
a
pretty
remarkable
saison
and
probably
the
best
ive
had
short
of
dupont
and
fantome
first
saison
and
highly
impressed
this
is
an
instant
go
to
beer
and
i
literally
went
out
and
bought
some
more
light
and
refreshing
hoppy
citrusy
nice
sour
notes
great
color
some
spice
notes
of
clove
dry
on
the
finish
slight
acidity
with
no
aftertaste
very
clean
maybe
some
fruitiness
almost
an
apple
or
maybe
white
wine
grape
nice
green
notes
like
good
olive
oil
in
the
nose
not
so
much
in
the
taste
but
enough
to
perk
up
the
taste
buds
loved
it
looking
forward
to
trying
others
in
this
style
but
also
wondering
why
got
a
good
one
with
tank
7
i
got
an
opportunity
to
pour
this
saisonfarmhouse
ale
beer
into
my
snifter
glasses
directly
from
12
fl
oz
bottle
there
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
big
white
head
its
smell
is
more
yeasty
and
citrusy
its
flavor
is
quite
nice
even
though
it
shows
a
long
dry
bright
finish
it
is
also
fresh
fruity
and
very
drinkable
very
good
saisonfarmhouse
ale
to
cheer
up
with
someone
else
who
is
avid
of
saison
style
pours
clear
golden
with
a
persistent
23
fingers
of
loose
white
foam
leaves
gobs
of
lace
smells
like
a
classic
saison
sweet
grain
with
clay
malts
plenty
of
yeast
character
a
bit
of
lemon
and
hay
middle
of
the
road
nose
tastes
like
its
got
some
band
aids
in
it
a
good
light
malt
backbone
with
some
seltzer
notes
a
good
amount
of
early
bitterness
some
metallic
hints
and
a
little
vinous
overtures
medium
bodied
with
tight
sharp
and
excessive
carb
a
thick
wet
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
im
inclined
to
appraise
or
seek
out
a
great
intro
to
the
middle
of
the
road
for
an
interested
party
o
good
beer
a
refreshing
kind
of
dessert
beer
oa
wellbalanced
saison
with
nice
flavors
and
wellhidden
abv
very
easy
drinking
o
overall
one
of
the
best
belgian
golden
saison
etc
ive
had
in
awhile
this
is
a
nice
simple
yet
tasty
saison
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
solid
its
smooth
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
the
abv
is
hidden
nicely
this
is
definitely
a
saison
i
will
have
again
clean
entry
growing
to
higher
alcohol
body
has
good
weight
definitely
some
bitterness
strawhay
on
the
palate
bright
citrus
heady
wit
nose
that
follows
through
to
a
rich
palate
a
serious
beer
that
exudes
power
over
its
expected
american
saison
witbier
character
a
bold
citrustoned
wit
not
a
session
but
say
a
rich
american
high
abv
version
of
something
like
allagash
white
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
spices
yeast
pepper
and
some
chalky
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
tropical
fruit
flavor
on
the
finish
and
a
slight
alcohol
kick
there
is
a
medium
spice
and
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
lots
of
carbonation
sets
up
the
flavours
well
particularly
the
little
apple
dip
at
the
end
picked
it
up
as
part
of
a
mix
and
match
sixer
almost
on
a
whim
glad
i
did
pleasant
surprise
poured
into
a
small
tulip
glass
an
orange
tinged
dull
light
golden
with
a
large
fluffysticky
white
head
that
left
two
full
rings
of
lace
behind
as
it
settled
verly
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
big
lemony
citrus
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
bready
malt
and
light
phenolic
spice
crisp
and
quite
dry
on
the
palate
with
citric
undertones
to
go
along
with
light
phenols
a
very
good
american
version
of
the
stylealot
of
the
time
i
stay
away
from
the
style
because
of
the
dreaded
funkthis
is
funk
subdued
nice
job
here
not
that
i
havent
liked
prevous
boulevard
beers
but
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
a
really
well
done
and
multidimensional
beer
overall
4
0
this
is
a
very
good
saison
i
wouldnt
say
it
merits
a
4
5
overall
but
its
better
than
just
4
0its
balanced
and
quaffable
especially
for
something
that
sits
at
8
abv
no
sense
of
the
beers
strength
whatsoever
to
be
honest
some
saisons
are
aggressively
spicy
and
carbonated
prickling
all
over
your
tongue
and
extremely
peppery
others
are
lighter
and
softer
and
this
is
an
example
of
a
saison
that
comes
off
as
moderately
fruity
and
wheatforward
with
a
light
tartness
that
matches
the
easy
mouthfeel
and
modest
fruitiness
o
quite
a
good
american
saison
for
fans
of
the
big
spicy
american
style
this
is
one
to
pick
up
i
have
tried
this
beer
several
times
the
first
being
the
750
ml
and
most
recently
in
some
12
oz
bottles
that
direct
from
the
brewery
which
i
will
admit
were
way
better
than
the
750
ml
bottle
overall
it
is
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
for
the
style
perhaps
i
just
prefer
the
belgian
brewers
offerings
better
but
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
would
probably
offer
to
it
to
someone
who
is
not
into
craft
beer
or
someone
who
has
never
tried
the
style
before
nice
look
smell
and
taste
just
did
not
overwhelm
me
overall
i
drink
this
all
the
time
despite
the
high
abv
responsible
for
many
nights
that
went
too
far
definatly
the
best
stateside
saison
ive
ever
had
prettymuch
textbook
except
for
the
beastly
abv
overall
the
appearance
and
flavor
are
really
great
but
the
mouthfeel
needs
work
if
this
could
be
lighter
and
dryer
it
would
really
be
an
outstanding
american
saison
still
mouthfeel
aside
it
is
a
good
beer
that
should
be
picked
up
should
you
come
across
it
overall
decent
prefer
other
saisons
for
sure
o
one
of
the
stronger
saisons
i
have
had
and
solid
all
around
the
flavors
are
there
but
a
slightly
lighter
body
may
have
been
more
appealing
for
me
overall
a
very
good
solid
saison
its
not
anything
too
special
but
its
still
a
great
tasting
beer
o
overall
solid
drinkability
here
refreshing
enough
to
throw
back
a
few
on
a
good
day
overall
a
very
good
brew
ths
is
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
am
very
pleased
i
will
be
looking
for
more
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
wish
i
had
purchased
more
then
just
1
price
is
not
bad
either
for
how
good
this
is
ive
seen
this
style
of
beer
go
for
twice
as
much
with
half
the
quality
an
enjoyable
well
done
saison
overalli
was
not
real
impressed
with
the
taste
and
have
no
real
desire
to
drink
this
beer
again
the
main
problem
i
had
with
this
beer
was
it
was
more
like
drinking
champagne
or
sparkeling
white
wine
than
beer
i
dont
really
like
wine
which
stands
to
reason
why
i
did
not
like
this
beer
it
looks
like
my
opinion
is
in
the
minority
so
by
all
means
try
it
out
for
yourself
if
you
like
champagne
or
fruity
wines
this
may
be
the
beer
for
you
pours
a
hazy
light
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
frothy
three
finger
head
smells
of
belgian
yeast
egg
shells
pepper
and
mild
citrus
first
sip
is
super
refreshing
with
a
great
hop
profile
that
has
a
tangy
grapefruit
and
honey
character
that
blends
nicely
with
the
light
earthy
malts
so
very
drinkable
as
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
and
a
tad
high
for
the
style
this
is
one
refreshing
brew
and
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
o
a
very
good
beer
with
along
finish
and
richness
a
very
nice
and
modern
old
ale
fabulous
with
a
casserole
o
one
of
my
favorite
american
interpretations
of
the
style
overall
great
beer
ordered
a
second
where
id
normally
rotate
to
try
something
new
the
taste
and
smell
bouquet
described
is
almost
overpowering
but
boulevard
got
it
right
in
balancing
things
out
to
make
it
an
enjoyable
saison
ale
great
belgian
inspired
brew
tastes
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
due
to
the
assertive
hop
character
d
very
nice
the
malt
and
hops
work
well
together
to
give
the
beer
sweetness
up
front
but
a
suitably
dry
finish
that
makes
it
compellingly
drinkable
the
yeast
adds
complexity
but
not
in
as
flashy
a
maner
as
some
examples
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
well
made

d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
superly
herbal
saisons
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
that
genre
complex
powerful
and
easy
to
put
down
overall
definetly
an
interesting
and
seemingly
pretty
accurate
introduction
to
the
style
im
not
sure
id
buy
a
sixer
of
it
right
away
but
then
again
im
usually
a
fan
of
darker
beers
so
i
certainly
wont
write
it
off
a
very
drinkable
brew
overall
great
take
on
the
farmhouse
style
not
exactly
blown
away
but
this
beer
is
still
solid
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
summertime
drink
great
wheat
and
floral
farmhouse
taste
i
really
like
this
and
would
consider
making
it

and

overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
its
bright
enough
to
be
refreshing
in
hotter
weather
but
still
has
enough
body
and
heft
to
it
to
make
it
a
solid
drink
in
colder
weather
as
well
if
i
had
to
be
stranded
with
only
one
type
of
beer
to
drink
ever
for
the
rest
of
my
life
tank
7
might
be
that
beer
in
my
opinion
the
best
beers
in
a
750ml
the
hop
bouquet
is
robust
and
citrusfull
i
like
this
better
than
most
other
saisons
because
it
doesnt
have
the
overt
hot
alcohol
flavor
in
present
in
most
belgians
the
addition
of
wheat
to
its
grain
bill
gives
it
a
fuller
mouthfeel
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
finishes
clean
despite
its
higher
abv
it
can
easily
turn
into
a
session
beer
if
your
local
bar
has
it
on
tap
worth
drinking
regularly
especially
on
tap
o
pretty
much
a
textbook
saison
very
well
done
and
sure
to
please
mmmmm
this
is
good
really
good
very
fruity
and
juicy
i
normally
dont
gravitate
towards
belgian
palesgoldenssaisons
but
tank
7
may
change
that
for
me
so
glad
to
have
them
here
in
georgia
now
lookin
forward
to
trying
more
from
the
smokestack
series
pours
a
murky
golden
color
with
an
admirable
rocky
white
head
that
devolves
into
sporadic
chunks
of
lacing
as
the
beer
recedes
aroma
smells
richly
of
pepper
hops
yeast
and
some
light
fruit
this
combination
actually
works
much
more
pleasantly
together
than
one
might
expect
the
pepper
that
was
so
prominent
in
the
nose
is
even
more
so
in
the
tastealmost
distractingly
so
there
are
some
spices
i
can
tolerate
in
abundance
but
pepper
is
not
one
of
them
the
bottle
touts
tropical
fruit
as
a
main
component
of
the
flavor
profile
and
much
to
my
surprise
there
is
an
evident
mango
aspect
to
the
taste
the
mango
is
more
noticeable
initially
before
it
starts
to
get
drowned
out
by
the
pepper
and
bitterness
but
its
definitely
there
theres
also
some
of
the
funkiness
typical
of
the
style
and
the
8
abv
is
well
concealed
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
crisp
just
how
i
like
it
but
thats
not
enough
to
redeem
this
beer
overall
theres
just
too
much
pepper
going
on
to
give
the
rest
of
the
elements
a
fair
shake
though
i
do
respect
boulevard
for
going
big
on
flavor
here
even
if
its
not
quite
too

sign
me
up

very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
very
good
saison
with
great
belgian
yeast
flavors
and
fruity
citrus
overtones
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
at
8
among
the
best
readily
available
saisons
out
there
overall
an
ok
saison
it
doesnt
seem
well
balanced
to
me
its
peppery
yeasty
lemony
grainy
on
the
palate
strong
right
up
front
and
mellows
out
to
a
nice
dry
finish
which
rounds
it
out
nicely
its
a
fine
drinking
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
lightly
warming
but
easily
felt
just
a
few
sips
and
i
can
feel
it
working
its
magic
great
saison
here
made
in
america
o
the
aroma
in
this
beer
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
still
a
good
saison
just
not
world
class
o
perhaps
most
amazing
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
well
it
hides
8
abv
could
have
a
few
super
impressed
with
this
one
and
ill
order
another
beats
a
dupont
anyday
overall
pretty
cool
saison
id
definitely
get
again
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
until
you
hit
some
yeast
floater
cloudiness
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
has
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
bready
yeast
tropical
fruit
and
pepper
on
the
tongue
o
a
very
good
farmhouse
ale
note
farmhouse
ale
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
has
a
nice
spiciness
and
the
belgian
yeast
funk
does
not
go
over
the
top
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
this
beer
can
cool
you
down
and
still
provide
some
entertainment
for
your
palate
a
really
good
beer
drinkable
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
to
let
you
know
youre
enjoying
a
beer
looks
and
smells
like
a
belgian
but
comes
up
just
short
in
taste
and
feel
still
awfully
good
rendition
by
an
american
brewer
o
one
of
the
better
domestic
saisons
out
there
as
a
fan
of
the
style
i
give
this
high
marks
great
tasting
beer
hazy
dark
yellow
color
with
a
nicely
fluffy
head
that
lasts
for
quite
some
time
some
lacing
is
present
floral
and
citrus
notes
abound
in
the
nose
over
a
lightly
peppered
biscuit
malt
aroma
the
flavor
starts
out
with
the
pepper
tones
and
has
the
malt
rise
up
to
meet
it
around
midsip
alongside
lemon
wedges
and
some
more
sweeter
citrus
elements
many
kinds
of
oranges
and
a
bit
of
lime
acid
splash
and
a
garnish
level
of
pear
esters
as
well
creamy
soft
texture
over
a
medium
body
other
than
swinging
a
hair
too
far
into
sweetness
for
my
preferences
its
hard
to
find
something
to
criticize
in
this
brew
overall
a
really
solid
beer
this
was
my
first
saisonfarmhouse
ale
and
i
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
i
typically
go
for
hoppy
beers
but
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
will
definitely
try
again
right
now
o
an
awesome
american
interpretation
of
the
saison
style
a
world
class
beer
ov
a
good
saison
slightly
underwhelming
finish
i
would
return
to
this
not
a
style
of
beer
im
overly
familiar
with
but
which
ive
had
a
few
over
the
years
and
this
has
been
a
consistent
winner
to
me
light
and
vibrant
enough
with
a
distinct
taste
profile
that
if
given
an
open
mind
for
the
style
is
readily
appealing
nice
complexity
and
balance
easy
to
drink
even
if
youre
new
to
the
style
o
a
really
solid
farmhouse
ale
maybe
not
ground
breaking
but
certainly
a
solid
example
of
the
style
no
crazy
additions
or
wild
interpretations
but
solid
since
it
is
easily
available
a
perfect
into
to
the
style
nicely
done
d
this
was
a
solid
saison
with
a
refined
scent
and
taste
and
a
fitting
body
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
the
finish
was
pretty
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
great
refreshing
drink
for
summer
overall
another
exceptional
offering
by
boulevard
go
get
this
beer
drink
it
and
try
not
to
fall
in
love
with
it
absolutely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
for
a
while
one
of
my
new
favorites
highly
recommended
excellent
job
overall
a
very
good
farmhouse
ale
this
was
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
boulevard
and
im
pretty
impressed
nice
job
o
tank
7
is
a
beautiful
slightly
hoppy
saison
this
is
an
everyday
and
affordable
saison
perfect
for
summer
but
quite
frankly
i
could
drink
this
any
time
i
love
this
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
way
to
drinkable
for
8
i
love
a
saison
that
has
a
clear
citrus
personality
overtopping
the
yeast
o
wow
what
a
great
beer
admittedly
as
a
biased
ipa
fanatic
i
like
my
saisons
low
on
yeast
but
high
on
hops
and
since
this
fits
the
criteria
brilliantly
ill
be
hunting
this
one
down
in
the
near
future
i
for
one
welcome
our
new
missouri
overlords
to
maryland
overall
this
was
a
truly
fantastic
saison
from
boulevard
complex
yet
approachable
this
should
be
drank
fresh
as
the
hop
flavors
really
complement
the
yeast
love
the
drinkability
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
recommended
to
all
cheers
overall
yes
its
a
good
saison
but
perhaps
a
saison
needs
to
do
something
exceptional
to
break
it
out
of
the
banal
still
ive
had
very
few
saisons
this
good
outside
of
belgium
and
the
smoothness
crispness
and
general
drinkability
of
this
one
is
commendable
overall
a
very
good
beer
indeed
quite
a
hoppy
saison
perhaps
more
of
a
belgian
ipa
whatever
you
call
it
it
is
yummy
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
different
take
on
the
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
enjoyable
o
a
good
saison
overall
many
american
saisons
are
often
too
sweet
or
heavily
spiced
for
me
but
this
one
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
one
with
lots
of
funky
and
barnyard
flavors
overall
very
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
really
nicely
balanced
saison
nice
amount
of
yeast
and
spices
poured

with
lots

carbonation
and
a
big
pillowy
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
beautiful
on
this
beer
it
is
dominated
by
a
spicy
zesty
character
of
coriander
lemon
zest
pepper
and
as
the
beer
warms
some
hop
character
as
well
very
quiet
bready
malt
in
the
back
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
very
full
of
carbonation
it
almost
takes
away
from
the
beer
but
not
quite
its
quite
dry
up
front
lots
of
sweet
lemons
spicy
burn
on
the
tongue
with
the
very
minimal
touch
of
burn
from
the
alcohol
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
im
glad
i
got
the
4

perhaps
a

simple
maybe
not
enough
farmhouse
but
really
so
tasty
and
cloneworthy
pretty
solid
saison
though
a
bit
strong
for
the
style
that
said
the
booze
doesnt
show
through
and
its
well
put
together
and
easy
to
drink
o
stellar
offering
from
boulevard
this
is
a
definite
go
to
beer
for
this
style
the
alcohol
could
be
a
little
too
aggressive
but
is
complimented
well
enough
not
to
ruin
it
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
and
would
of
the
wife
would
allow
it
originally

presentation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
in
to
a
tulip
glass
that
came
with
the
gift
set
overall
a
real
solid
saison
this
brewery
makes
some
pretty
solid
beer
overall
this
is
quite
good
it
would
be
tasty
any
day
but
it
really
hits
the
spot
on
this
hot
humid
summer
evening
i
wish
this
were
more
easily
accessible
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
overall
the
quintessential
american
take
on
a
belgianstyle
not
a
thing
i
would
change
overall
a
very
well
rounded
beer
i
am
pretty
impressed
as
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
on
tap
or
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
glad
to
see
boulevard
beers
available
here
in
baltimore
at
long
last
o
a
good
saison
very
earthy
and
spicy
alcohol
is
kind
of
noticeable
i
will
try
this
again
very
happy
that
boulevard
is
now
in
md
cant
wait
to
try
more
beers
from
boulevard
o
my
first
farmhouse
ale
on
tap
and
i
was
impressed
a
complex
and
flavorful
yet
refreshing
ale
the
best
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
so
far
the
beer
is
transparent
and
golden
colored
with
14
of
white
head
after
a
slow
pour
into
a
snifter
the
aroma
offers
grass
yeast
lemons
funk
smells
inviting
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
everything
well
balanced
a
touch
of
funk
sits
nicely
with
light
citrus
notes
particularly
lemons
the
finish
offers
some
herbal
notes
and
lingering
floral
hops
light
to
medium
in
body
good
stuff
i
would
like
to
have
this
again
a
hazy
golden
body
holds
up
a
1
5
tall
cream
colored
head
of
medium
density
lots
of
carbonation
can
be
seen
rising
through
the
beer
head
retention
is
very
good
this
beer
is
appears
as
a
saison
should
aroma
is
primarily
of
sweet
saison
funk
but
i
also
detect
citric
hops
the
taste
starts
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
as
the
beer
crests
the
tongue
i
get
a
bit
more
citric
hops
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
the
finish
includes
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
funk
a
decent
funk
flavor
carries
the
beer
across
the
tongue
body
is
of
medium
thickness
carbonation
is
not
as
aggressive
as
something
like
saison
dupont
but
is
is
there
in
enough
quantity
to
make
this
very
drinkable
the
8
abv
surprised
me
overall
this
is
a
very
good
saisonfarmhouse
ale
i
quite
like
the
flavor
profile
but
as
a

enthusiast
i
dont
think
this
would
make

the

along
with
a

slight
bready

flavor
with
a
bit

very
light

and
just
a

bit

alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
crisp
dry
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
the
only
other
saison
ive
had
from
these
guys
was
saison
brett
and
i
must
say
that
they
know
exactly
what
theyre
doing
when
it
comes
to
this
style
of
beer
this
mediumbodied
saison
is
packed
with
flavor
and
complexity
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
present
but
not
enough
so
that
makes
it
intolerable
very
easy
to
drink
a
damn
tasty
brew
and
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
smokestack
series
enjoyed
this
more
as
it
warmed
it
feels
and
drinks
bigger
than
8
and
i
tend
to
like
this
style
smaller
and
a
little
sweeter
nonetheless

very

appearance

excellent

has
a
strong

flavor
which
is
great
if
you
like
that
a

much
for
me
very

feel
however
an
overall
great
pick
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
think
it
would
pair
very
nicely
with

this
beer
was
at

it
just
was
incredible

the

it
was
pretty
amazing
watching
almost
everyone
give
it
a

the
light

advocates
didnt
like
it
but
i
thought
it
was
great
the
perfect
antidote
to
watered
down
beer
overall
very
aromatous
and
flavorful

this
is
an
excellent

is

a
great
american
example

never

and
i
must

its
pretty
damn
good
maybe
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
their
tripel
but
honestly
that
was
a
tough
act
to
follow
and
this
did
just
fine
after
a
couple
of
weeks
drinking

with

this

has
been
a

breath

definitely
beers
worth
purchasing
drinkability
is
good
for
a
bigger

a
real
treat
but
perhaps
more
delicious

than
i
like

a
little
heavy

really
easy

the
first

i
got
this
one
i
didnt
like
it
that
much
but
it
has
grown
on
me
and
i
relish
it
now
d
abv
seems
a
little
high
for
a
saison
im
feeling
a
bit
lightheaded
but
the
crispness
and
thickness
is
very
nice
not
my
favorite
but
good
nonetheless
im
hoping
the
bottle
of
saison
brett
of
which
tank

is
the
base
beer
is
better
than
this
this
is
a
great
beer
while
the
alcohol
is
slightly
high
it
is
not
noticeable
in
any
form
and
is
a
very
delicious
and
refreshing
beer

this

along

another
great
offering
from

will
drink
again
a
really
unique
barrel
aged
saison
the
red
wine
doesnt
show
up
a
whole
lot
but
the
brett
here
is
the
real
star
restrained
and
elegant
and
just
tasty
as
fuck
great
great
great
great
sick
overall
it
has
been
some
time
since
i
have
had
this
beer
but
wont
forget
it
now
so
delicious
and
each
dip
got
better
and
better
overall
the
brett
is
off
the
freakin
charts
throughout
this
beer
to
make
matters
even
more
tart
and
sour
the
oak
barreling
and
bitterness
of
the
wine
grapes
catapults
interlude
to
the
next
level
the
latter
is
remarkable
in
that
you
get
all
of
the
grapey
skinned
bitterness
without
any
fleshy
juiciness
or
cloying
sweetness
at
the
same
time
however
it
never
comes
across
at
all
like
a
winey
flavoring
as
the
oak
itself
tends
to
be
more
subtle
it
is
obviously
present
enough
to
be
able
to
transfer
that
intense
grape
quality
but
again
they
are
distinct
and
separate
entities
in
their
intensity
and
showiness
for
anyone
looking
to
satisfy
their
craving
for
a
bitter
sour
puckering
wild
farmhousy
beer
youre
in
luck
on
all
accounts
we
are
so
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
wellrounded
yet
wonderfully
unique
beer
overall
like
the
hot
girl
at
the
bar
that
sucks
in
bed
this
is
all
about
looks
and
smell
its
a
show
with
no
substance
or
style
at
the
end
of
the
day
youre
better
off
with
your
old
sock
overall
the
appearance
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
really
quite
exceptional
the
taste
and
mouth
were
both
disappointing
and
unpleasant
not
what
i
was
expecting
its
like
all
the
bad
parts
of
barrel
aging
with
brettanomyces
came
together
with
this
beer
its
unfortunate
probably
would
not
buy
again
well
thats
wrong
i
would
like
to
try
thus
fresh
and
note
the
differences
but
after
a
year
and
a
half
im
not
really
a
fan
just
drank
a
2011
bottle
021215
and
it
was
phenomenal
taste
score
on
the
2011
would
be
a
4
5
with
a
similar
bump
in
the
overall
score
not
sure
if
its
the
age
or
the
particular
vintage
but
the
2011
was
a
different
beer
and
by
far
my
favorite
compared
to

i
remember
were
the
crazy
cantaloupe
and

melon
flavors
presumably
from
the
brett
would
love
to
try
again
tasted
from
draft
at

on

2015
picked
up
at
costco
for
16
poured
into
glasses
and
shared
with
friends
who
love
brett
this
beer
was
wonderful
it
has
a
fruitiness
that
id
not
experienced
in
a
beer
before
because
i
believe
it
comes
from
the
brett
rather
than
hops
which
im
more
accustomed
to
pineapple
apricot
peach
and
some
dried
fruit
and
none
of
the
horse
blanketstraw
id
learned
to
expect
from
brett
just
about
perfect
mouth
feel
and
carbonation
overall
this
beer
really
floored
me
with
how
good
it
is
one
hell
of
a
beer

strangest
assault
on
the
ol

buds
in

not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
here
as
much
as
lets
just
throw
some
stuff
down
the
chute
see
what
comes
out
imho
this
is
an
aimless
taste
profile
befuddling
at
best
if
it
wasnt
that
i
paid
for
it
the
9
5
abv
i
would
have
poured
it
on
the
floor
as
a
wax
remover
the
only
notes
im
registering
are
dont
waste
your
time
money
on
this
focusless
nonsense
plenty
of
red
wine
flavors
with
oak
too
these
also
permeate
the
aroma
where
hints
of
barnyard
smells
detract
outstanding
beer
very
elegant
with
amazing
complexity
and
lots
of
grapes
and
bretta
it
felt
like
a
mix
of
a
saison
and
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
light
and
fruity
with
a
bretty
funky
earthy
edge
to
it
tannic
and
tart
with
a
bit
of
a
vinous
character
to
it
nice
beer
so
much
character
to
this
beauty
lucky
enough
to
find
it
on
tap
at
the
farmhouse
burlington
pale
in
color
unassuming
and
even
drab
but
one
sniff
confirms
its
place
amongst
the
top
dwelling
wild
ales
of
the
word
a
ton
of
jammy
red
wine
essence
the
barrel
character
is
first
and
foremost
here
with
the
brett
right
behind
in
tow
the
flavor
is
a
little
different
with
the
yeast
way
out
ahead
of
the
red
wine
almost
strident
in
its
assertiveness
packing
both
alcohol
rawness
and
oaky
maturity
its
truly
a
weirdo
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
flavor
features
more
base
malt
than
anticipated
with
some
amount
of
wheat
and
the
brett
before
other
yeasts
its
super
dry
but
doesnt
lose
its
fruity
red
wine
character
i
am
impressed
with
the
subtlety
of
the
alcohol
and
all
the
cherry
character
of
the
booze
enough
body
for
all
the
flavors
to
hold
up
but
it
still
seems
light
to
me
for
some
reason
carbonation
is
relatively
up
beat
too
complex
as
they
come
and
different
from
the
wild
ale
crowd
something
special
here
overall
a
great
beer
incredible
flavor
and
complexity
when
you
understand
where
its
subtleties
come
from
and
to
top
it
off
its
strong
and
sweet
but
not
overpowering
another
great
ale
from
allagash
overall
an
excellent
saison
that
tastes
like
it
is
mixed
with
a
healthy
helping
of
fruit
juices
i
think
this
beer
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
that
allagash
makes
i
would
certainly
get
this
on
tap
if
again
prost
overall
this
beer
was
a
great
experience
to
which
i
can
hardly
do
justice
each
sip
is
a
little
different
as
the
flavors
play
off
one
another
sour
sweet
earthyfunky
some
beautiful
stuff
here
that
i
think
speaks
to
the
skill
of
managing
two
separate
fermentations
letting
each
contribute
to
the
fullest
overall
the
flavors
are
sublime
and
it
drinks
really
smooth
it
was
delicious
and
moderately
complex
my
review
is
nothing
compared
to
this
beer
its
hard
to
describe
o
this
is
first
full
glass
of
a
sour
beer
that
ive
gotten
through
and
enjoyed
its
a
luxury
and
not
something
that
i
see
myself
having
a
lot
of
but
i
definitely
look
forward
to
more
of
these
from
an
outstanding
brewery
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
red
wine
barrel
aged
ales
and
my
fourth
or
fifth
experience
with
wild
ales
the
nose
is
amazing
but
i
am
torn
between
the
pleasant
flavors
and
the
unpleasant
amount
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
too
delicate
to
withstand
the
presence
of
alcohol
if
i
can
find
another
2013
bottle
i
will
age
it
for
another
year
or
so
if
i
can
find
another
vintage
i
will
definitely
try
it
otherwise
and
it
pains
me
to
say
this
because
there
are
some
really
attractive
elements
to
this
beer
i
would
have
no
reason
to
buy
this
beer
again
paired
this
beer
with
grilled
chicken
and
coleslaw
what
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
many
different
dishes
the
beer
doesnt
overpower
the
food
and
it
doesnt
get
boozey
after
a
bite
of
food
either
this
beer
is
a
class
act
all
around
wether
you
are
just
drinking
the
beer
or
having
a
food
pairing
with
interlude
i
would
recommend
chicken
pork
any
seafood
or
freshwater
fish
paired
with
this
beer
o
very
enjoyable
i
like
the
candy
sweetness
mid
palate
and
how
the
sourness
is
complementary
to
the
flavors
lighter
body
with
a
crisp
finish
o
rated
this
a
straight
4
before
probably
gonna
end
up
just
north
of
that
wonder
if
the
bottle
was
just
a
little
off
given
the
opening
but
it
didnt
end
up
affecting
my
enjoyment
tap

rating
this
beer
is

a

not
something
i

and
get

with

along
with

and
a

odi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
allagash
makes
some
killer
brews
and
this
one
is
no
different
happy
to
have
grabbed
a
pint
of
this
a
bottle
is
it
a

pricey
i
was

very

with
a
pint
of
this

in
color
with
a
spare

that
dissipates
to
nearly
nothing
after
only
a
minute
aroma
is
quite
nice
the
first
first
waff
of
aroma
was
pretty
darn
amazing
fruits
in
the
fore
mostly
pears
some
oak
and
background
funk
as
the
beer
gets
a
chance
to
breathe
the
character
changes
a
bit
and
turns
more
vinous
and
funkier
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
only
it
leans
towards
the
funk
and
vinous
aspects
when
i
say
funk
im
not
going
as
far
as
all
out
horse
blanket
the
funkiness
while
the
dominant
taste
isnt
excessive
fruits
remain
in
the
background
and
there
is
a
light
breadiness
that
confirms
the
malt
backbone
there
isnt
much
hop
character
in
either
the
the
aroma
or
the
taste
but
that
may
be
due
to
the
age
of
this
particular
bottle
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
lightmedium
body
alcohol
presence
is
relatively
low
and
not
apparent
in
aroma
taste
or
mouthfeel
its
very
smooth
and
the
alcohol
definitely
sneaks
up
on
you
the
finish
is
fairly
balanced
its
a
bit
dry
at
first
then
some
sweetness
comes
in
the
balance
it
out
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
its
not
the
typical
saison
given
the
aging
in
wines
barrels
but
has
many
characteristics
of
the
style
if
you
have
the
patience
to
let
it
age
for
a
few
years
youll
find
a
beer
that
mellows
quite
well
ps
that
is
not
a
typo
i
had
the
will
power
or
stupidity
to
hold
onto
this
bottle
for
over
five
years
overall
a
great
and
complex
beer
a
bit
pricy
but
is
a
nice
treat
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
of
this
age
and
a
fresher
one
to
see
how
it
develops

the
beer
is
a

with
an
uneven
sparse
quickly
dispersing
white
head
aromas
of
tart
winelike
characteristics
cherry

and
some

are

that
keeps
everything
very
light
subtle
cinnamon
spice
noted
as
you

very

crisp
flavor
profiles
across
the
palate
the
fruit
characteristics
diversify
into
grape
apple
and
berry
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
the
tart
and
sourness
builds
as
you
drink
with
a
slightly
acidic
building
character
fruits
and
esthers
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
slight
puckering
feel
in
mouth
the
finish
is
crisp
dry
and
slightly
astringent
very
drinkable
very
robust
as
with
many
allagash
beers
it
is
pricey
but
leaves
you
feeling
it
was
worth
the
pinch
in
your
pocket
overall
love
the
taste
on
this
one
recommended
highly
this
is
a
real
treat
though
i
wish
i
could
get
some
more
sourness
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
warming
but
not
overbearing
and
the
belgian
flavors
and
dryness
is
balanced
the
beer
achieves
most
of
what
its
setting
out
to
accomplish
its
quite
the
tightrope
walk
and
mostly
successful
oa
nice
farmhouse
ale
with
a
great
range
of
flavors
tart
and
refreshing
o
a
great
beer
i
could
swear
that
this
one
used
to
be
classified
as
an
american
wild
but
either
way
its
fantastic
a
bit
steep
but
the
flavors
and
complexity
are
worth

offering
would
like
to
try
a

vintage
of
this
in
the
future
to
compare
overall
quite
good
o
while
tasty
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
bit
more
of
the
base
saison
shine
through
overallgood
saison
taste
the
aging
in
barrels
adds
to
its
appeal
i
would
not
seek
this
again
unless
someone
wanted
a
bubbly
wine
tasting
beer
or
to
show
this
as
an
example
of
something
you
would
never
think
to
call
beer

bretty

light

pretty
interesting
and
satisfying
dry
medium
bodied
tart
and
somewhat
crisp
drinks
a
lot
easier
than
it
should
o
i
feel
like
this
beer
stopped
10
yrds
before
the
finish
line
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
to
be
good
but
it
really
isnt
there
yet
which
just
leaves
me
confused
and
kinda
disappointed
overall
a
real
neat
take
and
strangely
not
wine
like
but
with
great
wine
character
enjoyable
rereview
i
tried
this
again
on
tap
and
it
was
a
totally
different
experience
the
brett
flavors
were
amazing
with
a
perfect
balance
of
fruit
yeast
and
sour
revising
score
significantly
o
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easy
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
and
complex
belgianstyle
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
a
really
interesting
brew
that
blurs
the
lines
between
saison
gueuze
and
red
wine
would
love
to
try
it
out
of
the
bottle
next
time
to
see
if
the
carbonation
issues
are
resolved
a
decent
beer
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
theres
significant
room
for
improvement
ultimately
the
23
price
tag
renders
this
beer
not
worth
the
money
at
least
not
for
repeat
purchases
t
a
musty
funk
right
away
with
heavy
white
grape
and
triple
notes
a
definite
touch
o
white
wine
in
the
middle
with
a
finish
thats
heavy
on
the
crackery
malt
and
shows
some
brett
as
well
a
kind
of
lingering
tartness
throughout
that
never
turns
sour
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
i
am
glad
i
drank
this
now
as
i
dont
anticipate
it
would
have
improved
any
more
o
tough
beer
to
score
initial
hit
is
very
sour
like
a
wild
ale
or
a
really
bad
saison
but
it
slowly
gets
better
through
the
taste
decent
in
the
middle
with
a
really
pleasant
graham
cracker
crust
aftertaste
i
tried
not
to
knock
it
down
too
hard
its
well
balanced
complex
and
it
has
some
aspects
that
i
enjoy
but
it
has
some
really
off
flavors
too
with
the
extreme
funkiness
and
sour
notes
i
ended
up
drain
pouring
it
but
tried
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
on
the
scores
o
this
is
everything
i
was
hoping
it
to
be
and
more
they
nailed
the
style
and
the
barrelagingbrett
component
perfectly
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
years
and
it
completely
surpassed
my
expectations
i
had
some
issues
with
this
beer
but
in
the
end
once
it
approached
room
temperature
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
although
i
still
feel
the
wine
character
was
lacking
id
definitely
drink
this
again
after
letting
it
warm
but
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
bottle
o
this
is
a
delicious
brew
excellent
work
with
the
yeast
strains
and
barrels
excellent
balance
and
great
flavor
give
this
a
try
if
you
get
te
opportunity
i
know
i
should
go
on
about
how
wonderful
it
is
but
im
running
on
empty
right
now
m
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
essentially
zero
head
very
good
clarity
and
color
smell
is
pretty
funky
with
plenty
of
yeast
some
doughs
and
fruit
are
also
noticed
taste
is
fairly
dry
with
a
nice
tartness
some
fruit
comes
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
dry
but
light
overall
this
is
really
nice
pretty
dry
but
still
some
sourness
overall
a
well
made
beer
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
wild
to
dry
and
not
enough
sour
for
the
nice
fruity
flavours
present
for
this
guy
anyways
2007
bottle
opened
in
2012
the
bottle
opened
with
a
loud
pop
and
a
little
foam
overflow
it
poured
a
cloudy
murky
lighter
caramel
color
it
had
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
did
leave
some
lacing
getting
a
whiff
of
sourness
to
the
nose
aromas
include
wheat
lemon
breadiness
spices
and
some
oakiness
the
taste
is
excellent
touch
of
sour
funkiness
to
it
wheat
lemon
spice
and
oakiness
also
excellent
o
i
think
i
paid
21
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
so
its
not
something
i
can
afford
to
drink
every
day
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
very
fine
example
of
a
barrel
aged
farmhouse
brett
beer
i
would
suggest
this
over
just
about
any
other
beer
out
there
this
was
the
2011
version
this
isnt
a
beer
for
everyone
due
to
the
amount
of
funk
but
it
was
perfectly
fine
by
me
great
depth
on
both
the
aromas
and
feel
there
is
a
real
good
dry
finish
to
this
as
well
o
this
one
certainly
shouldnt
be
classified
as
an
american
wild
ale
i
enjoy
the
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
suits
them
well
but
my
expectations
were
skewed
that
said
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
pretty
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
especially
given
the
price
low
b
tart
upfront
and
in
the
middle
tart
grapes
and
young
red
wine
favrs
then
some
woody
toasted
water
cracker
flavors
pop
up
to
help
round
out
the
funk
and
earth
not
too
tart
and
just
a
little
warm
this
was
a
nice
sipper
with
great
carbonation
a
world
class
effort
from
the
folks
at
allagash
how
i
wish
i
could
get
their
brews
here
at
home
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
enjoyed
every
sip
of
this
this
is
a
special
beer
with
complex
aroma
and
flavors
but
easy
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
dark
amber
and
smells
of
apple
cider
vinegar
the
11
smells
like
jesus
with
potent
wine
notes
some
funk
and
strong
sourness
the
11
packs
a
super
b
o
pungency
as
well
both
taste
excellent
with
strong
notes
of
apple
cider
vinegar
sourness
and
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
more
pronounced
in
the
11
than
the
09
but
both
are
quite
drinkable
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
i
would
recommend
a
warmer
cellar
temperature
for
drinking
but
its
still
a
very
flavorful
ale
personally
i
like
the
09
better
but
im
sure
if
we
sat
on
the
11
for
2
years
it
would
be
just
as
nice
o
in
my
mind
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
wild
ale
it
smells
great
and
tastes
wellbalanced
between
sweet
sour
and
funky
flavors
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
more
sour
than
it
actually
was
but
this
lack
of
sourness
and
the
resulting
balance
seemed
to
make
the
beer
more
drinkable
and
less
heartburninducing
maybe
a
little
pricey
to
get
more
than
a
couple
of
times
but
absolutely
a
very
good
beer
feel
matches
the
taste
profile
very
well
light
to
medium
body
with
only
a
soft
carbonation
rolls
over
the
tongue
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
given
what
other
exceptional
wild
ales
cost
consecration
is
13
for
a
12
oz
paying
20
bucks
for
this
is
reasonable
im
using
it
celebrate
and
i
encourage
you
to
do
the
same
d
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
forms
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
grape
jellyjam
and
some
grape
juice
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
a
nice
fruity
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
am
really
enjoying
the
grape
aromas
and
flavors
i
am
getting
from
this
one
o
was
this
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
no
not
really
but
it
was
still
quite
good
this
was
almost
like
a
brown
ale
that
went
slightly
sour
in
a
good
way
i
guess
that
is
not
totally
fair
here
since
i
guess
the
whole
point
of
the
wine
barrelaging
is
so
that
the
harsh
acidity
would
mellow
out
making
this
sour
but
not
primed
for
the
sourhead
o
i
was
expecting
something
much
more
sour
than
this
and
i
was
slightly
disappointed
but
the
beer
is
still
delcious
and
i
think
i
might
go
get
another
bottle
to
age
o
an
awesome
beer
i
ate
steak
tips
with
this
and
it
was
absolutely
incredible
grab
a
bottle
of
this
if
you
can
overall
this
lacks
the
complexity
i
was
hoping
for
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
some
nice
cheese
o
although
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
this
beer
the
amount
of
dryness
lends
it
to
being
more
of
a
sipper
o
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
of
the
brett
offerings
from
allagash
probably
would
not
pick
it
up
again
o
i
really
liked
this
better
with
some
age
on
it
but
had
never
had
it
this
fresh
before
i
think
at
least
a
year
and
this
would
be
the
beer
i
remembered
overall
a
very
unique
tasting
strong
ale
one
like
i
have
never
tasted
in
the
past
but
definitely
plan
to
do
so
again
in
the
future
overall
not
supplication
and
not
really
close
even
though
this
is
very
good
the
gulf
in
class
is
vast
even
if
the
numbers
in
this
review
say
otherwise
i
got
me
a
sweet
connect
to
a
cheap
supply
of
this
stuff
and
boy
am
i
glad
it
is
delicious
if
the
top
teir
sours
out
there
are
better
than
this
i
have
great
things
to
look
forward
to
it
was
just
sweet
and
had
a
great
brett
flavor
that
was
not
to
sour
no
vinegar
at
all
which
i
imagine
i
would
not
like
or
want
i
could
sip
on
this
all
day
in
the
winter
or
summer
day
or
night
in
jail
or
on
bail
no
matter
you
could
do
a
heck
of
alot
worse
enjoy
this
no
matter
the
cost
try
it
just
once
it
is
worth
it
in
the
body
you
also
pick
up
the
wine
presence
this
makes
for
a
very
good
sipping
opportunity
this
beer
has
lots
of
great
layers
the
feel
is
also
really
good
i
enjoyed
savoring
this
beer
o
quite
nice
i
love
wilds
and
wine
drinkers
would
really
like
this
as
well
its
price
point
is
similar
to
a
lowerend
to
okay
bottle
of
wine
but
this
is
far
more
complex
id
choose
this
over
a
wine
any
day
o
a
very
good
ale
close
to
a
wild
but
not
quite
would
characterize
as
a
good
and
approachable

sours

expected
with
a
pronounced
honey
presence
throughout
nice
brett
quality
a
solid
beer
as
is
customary
with
me
i
would
prefer
more
sour
funk
character
in
lieu
of
sweetness
pours
an
orangish
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
off
white
head
fairly
murky
in
appearance
as
well
like
river
water
the
nose
is
brett
with
some
caramel
malt
fairly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
the
taste
is
really
good
just
a
tad
sweet
for
my
tastes
honey
caramel
cherry
oak
and
brett
are
the
main
tastes
i
get
in
here
i
dont
get
any
of
the
9
5
abv
at
all
maybe
some
straw
in
the
aftertaste
feel
is
medium
syrupy
sweet
and
bitter
on
the
back
end
overall
a
very
nice
beer
but
id
like
a
little
less
sweetness
in
it
and
more
sourness
im
sure
it
would
age
very
well
maybe
ill
try
that
some
day
cheers
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
very
clean
and
drinkable
it
pours
a
medium
bodied
and
cloudy
dirty
auburn
in
color
with
a
slight
white
lacing
around
my
snifter
the
nose
is
very
dry
funky
bretty
with
an
interesting
fruity
tartness
which
is
almost
melonesque
perhaps
its
aged
hops
regardless
it
has
more
fruit
in
the
nose
than
i
anticipated
the
flavors
are
extremely
dry
and
funky
it
is
barnyard
galore
and
a
brett
bomb
you
get
some
slight
fruit
like
sweetness
but
this
is
all
dry
brett
it
drinks
fine
but
like
ive
said
is
almost
too
dry
overall
its
a
nice
sour
and
has
enough
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
throughout
i
wouldnt
say
its
worth
the
20
pricetag
though
poured
a
clearish
amber
brown
body
with
minimal
head
that
leaves
lace
on
top
of
an
oaky
woody
malty
aroma
but
also
has
some
floral
hops
sour
fruit
and
funk
body
is
more
of
the
same
as
i
get
a
smooth
somewhat
creamy
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
this
puckering
sour
sweetness
i
get
this
rush
of
sweet
caramel
malts
that
have
some
thickness
yeastbread
along
with
light
fruits
grape
and
tropical
like
pear
and
this
rush
of
a
sour
almost
tart
finish
very
well
balanced
and
i
was
shocked
at
the
almost
10
abv
i
dont
want
to
say
winelike
but
it
reminded
me
of
a
heavier
white
wine
w
the
sweetness
being
prevelant
and
the
plush
fruit
taste
afterwards
taste
is
really
tart
and
funky
with
a
nice
rich
red
wine
flavor
dry
and
its
almost
like
theres
some
tannin
in
it
very
unique
and
tasty
overall
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
sour
ale
from
allagash
in
fact
i
think
this
is
probably
the
least
enjoyable
sour
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
found
it
to
be
overly
tart
sharply
so
and
a
bit
heavy
on
the
oak
for
me
this
left
the
overall
taste
to
be
rather
disjointed
with
nothing
really
coming
together
for
me
there
were
no
wine
barrel
flavors
and
the
acidic
tangy
flavors
were
just
too
disjointed
and
left
me
wanting
so
so
much
more
taste
is
super
funky
with
big
spikes
of
flavor
left
and
right
hops
yeast
brett
earthy
funk
oak
barrels
and
a
belgian
tripel
spice
profile
tastes
like
a
tripel
hooked
up
with
a
sour
one
drunken
evening
crazy
and
fun
and
enjoyable
but
hardly
sessionable
an
interesting
drink
for
sure
a
flavorful
fruity
very
mildly
sour
ale
from
allagash
i
was
actually
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
one
though
i
didnt
know
at
all
what
to
expect
pours
a
reddish
brown
apple
cider
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
disapates
almost
instantly
leaving
a
ring
of
foam
around
my
glass
producing
great
lacing
aroma
of
oak
red
wine
funk
and
slight
vinegar
taste
is
tart
and
fruity
with
a
finish
of
oak
and
redwine
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
just
behind
russian
rivers
consecration
in
my
opinion
although
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
can
appreciate
the
efforts
made
by
allagash
to
concoct
a
creative
version
of
an
american
wild
ale
the
end
product
did
not
come
together
quite
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
perhaps
putting
some
age
on
a
bottle
of
interlude
would
result
in
a
beer
with
a
more
rounded
and
better
integrated
flavor
profile
this
is
a
high
quality
wild
ale
broad
complex
flavors
and
aromas
highly
enjoyable
i
like
that
too
sour
is
just
not
enjoyable
sometimes
2011
note
i
now
disagree
with
this
perspective
but
that
was
my
viewpoint
back
in
the
day
smooth
palate
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
wish
we
had
more
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
brew
and
thought
the
oak
aging
was
well
worth
the
time
and
effort
o
highlight
of
this
allagash
tasting
truly
stands
out
4

110
wow
sourness
does
a
total
180
and
is
very
light
on
the
taste
brett
still
holds
firm
as
well
as
sweet
grains
and
alcohol
barrel
conditioning
is
quite
evident
and
shows
off
some
pretty
impressive
oakiness
at
first
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
downturn
in
sourness
but
the
depth
of
oak
and
complexity
are
really
quite
enjoyable
actually
reminds
me
of
curieux
minus
the
bourbon
and
funk
of
course
i
dont
think
it
quite
lived
up
to
my
expectations
but
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
o
a
reasonably
complex
brew
the
different
characteristics
of
this
beer
really
blend
for
an
introspective
drinking
experience
love
the
dryness
and
crisp
flavors
the
mouth
really
accentuates
the
flavor
transitions
the
silent
champion
of
this
beer
is
the
oak
strong
flavors
are
subdued
in
favor
of
nuanced
ones
sour
oaking
is
quite
nice
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
am
not
sure
the
age
has
helped
it
though
pours
an
interesting
reddish
orange
hue
somewhere
between
a
blood
orange
and
grapefruit
minimal
spots
of
head
scent
was
quite
fruity
white
and
red
wine
with
notes
of
tropical
mango
and
citrus
tangerine
notes
of
musty
hay
damp
wood
and
dry
oak
quite
unique
flavor
was
quite
exquisite
the
notes
of
wine
grapes
work
wonderfuly
with
the
notes
mango
and
tangerine
the
woodieness
of
the
beer
contains
both
musty
notes
from
the
yeast
and
dry
toasted
notes
from
the
wine
barrels
light
notes
of
vanilla
and
grahmn
cracker
provide
sweetness
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
under
control
quite
dry
on
the
palate
quite
the
standout
beer
o
good
beer
wish
it
had
more
wild
characteristics
towards
the
way
of
a
lambic
then
this
would
be
killer
definitely
worth
trying
out
its
a
shame
its
so
expensive
or
id
be
drinking
this
all
summer
definitely
a
good
beer
to
let
wine
drinkers
know
whats
reallly
good
super
clean
and
dry
mouthfeel
really
well
attenuated
beer
almost
no
after
taste
really
pleased
i
let
this
sit
for
very
well
near
2
years
it
has
aged
very
well
now
i
wish
i
had
more
i
must
say
allagash
beers
always
seem
to
age
well
o
i
loved
this
as
is
but
i
would
love
to
try
it
with
the
funk
dialed
down
sometime
overall
huge
thanks
to
whichever
generous
trader
hooked
me
up
with
this
bottle
sorry
it
was
last
summer
i
saved
this
for
a
special
occasion
turns
out
that
i
got
an
a
in
medieval
latin
and
finished
grading
120
student
exams
im
glad
i
saved
it
for
a
special
occasion
as
its
a
really
interestingspecial
beer
the
verdict
tasty
beer
and
one
of
the
sexiestlooking
libations
ive
ever
had
grace
my
glass
that
said
at
20
00
its
not
quite
perfect
enough
to
justify
picking
it
up
at
the
asking
price
unlike
allagashs
curieux
which
id
probably
pay
double
for
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
think
i
like
it
fresher
better
but
still
enjoyable
overall
a
tasty
beer
not
in
my
top
10
sours
but
still
tasty

out

this
most
noticeably
out
of
the
wine

but
brett
has
a
way
of
imparting
its
own
distinct
flavors
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinks
well
a
nice
wild
ale
that
obviously
took
some
fine
craftsmanship
to
brew
o
this
was
a
2007
vinetage
which
i
thought
was
pretty
cool
but
these
wilds
i
think
are
just
my
thing
i
think
this
one
is
just
too
sour
but
some
bas
will
clearly
love
this
one
if
i
had
access
to
another
id
split
for
sure
no
way
i
could
handle
this
dude
myself
maybe
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
because
the
brett
has
really
taken
hold
here
its
by
far
and
away
the
dominate
flavor
and
aroma
i
cant
get
any
notes
from
the
wine
because
of
it
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
white
grape
sourness
and
hints
of
cabernet
in
the
taste
sour
white
grapes
sweet
tarts
and
a
small
dryness
of
a
cabernet
a
sour
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
sour
whine
like
aftertaste
big
sourness
and
i
think
i
might
like
wine
now
very
nice
wild
ale
i
really
want
to
grab
another
to
cellar
for
a
bit
longer
and
open
at
a
tasting
ultradrinkable
great
bottle
cant
wait
till
another
one
bounces
its
way
in
front
of
me
o
overall
a
good
wild
ale
nothing
superb
but
it
avoids
being
nothing
but
sour
funk
like
many
wild
ales
seem
to
be
o
overall
the
flavors
show
restraint
and
balance
and
have
some
nice
beveled
edges
instead
of
dominating
your
palate
o
fantastic
stuff
my
favorite
allagash
beer
cheers
drinkability
was
ok
about
half
a
bottle
was
just
abouth
right
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
worth
the
money
overall
not
too
bad
but
seems
a
mediocre
beer
was
soured
proof
a
good
sour
is
usually
made
with
a
stellar
beer
as
well
not
too
much
as
far
as
any
wine
notes
go
in
this
though
it
is
a
nice
funky
framboise
of
sorts
but
not
up
to
the
likes
of
cascade
and
russian
river
d
nicely
drinkable
despite
the
subdued
flavors
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
or
to
lure
a
winedrinker
to
the
dark
side
overall
a
nice
wild
ale
with
some
depth
and
complexity
to
the
flavor
expensive
yes
but
worth
trying
atleast
once
edit
i
was
able
to
enjoy
a
2006
version
that
i
had
aged
for
about
5
years
the
hop
notes
that
i
felt
before
have
all
but
disappeared
and
the
tartness
has
also
diminished
as
well
the
beer
is
still
quite
delicious
it
seems
t
have
developed
very
nicely
there
seems
to
be
a
nice
slightly
sweeter
more
mature
fruit
character
quite
delicious
the
vinous
notes
have
shifted
to
a
more
apple
juicecider
type
flavor
with
not
as
much
tartness
very
good
brew
for
aging
overall
impression
not
the
most
complex
wild
ale
youll
find
but
well
worth
a
shot
this
is
good
maybe
not
as
complex
as
some
other
varieties
of
the
style
but
tasty
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
goes
nice
with
food
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
vintage
december
2009
once
the
cork
popped
i
got
a
nice
whiff
of
funk
and
brett
it
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
some
beautiful
carbonation
the
head
is
medium
size
and
white
as
snow
scent
is
wonderful
with
some
very
strong
resemblance
to
wine
there
are
some
heavy
grape
aromas
as
well
as
oak
and
sour
funk
i
also
get
apples
and
cherries
as
well
first
sip
is
yeasty
and
funky
you
can
definitely
taste
the
brett
in
this
one
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
not
as
sour
as
the
nose
tends
to
imply
but
rather
pleasantly
tart
there
are
some
flavors
of
oak
grape
belgian
yeast
and
apple
leaves
a
champagnelike
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
full
bodied
drinkability
is
scarily
high
for
a
9
5
beer
would
love
to
see
how
some
more
age
would
treat
this
beer
finally
getting
another
shot
at
interlude
and
its
ontap
interestingly
the
news
that
theyve
got
some
darkness
kegs
downstairs
intrigues
me
further
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orange
topped
by
a
quarterfinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
apple
cider
light
brett
mandarin
oranges
lemon
zest
and
cinnamon
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lime
orange
zest
light
nutmeg
pepper
mild
brett
and
a
few
sparse
cobwebs
the
body
is
a
lightish
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
feel
overall
a
nice
bit
o
wildness
but
a
tad
mild
on
the
flavor
i
was
looking
for
just
a
pinch
more
pop
so
to
speak
good
times
nonetheless
d
very
enjoyable
high
alchocol
content
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability
though
this
beer
pours
an
translucent
orange
color
there
isnt
much
head
to
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
this
particular
pour
perhaps
its
just
the
way
it
was
served
the
smell
is
of
a
woodsy
funk
more
of
the
sour
from
the
oak
in
the
funk
but
it
was
definitely
a
brett
smell
the
flavor
is
strongly
of
citrus
and
not
nearly
as
much
sour
as
i
had
expected
from
a
wild
ale
though
i
must
admit
the
main
flavor
tasted
almost
exclusively
of
oranges
tangerines
wedges
to
be
more
specific
however
i
found
the
beer
to
be
a
little
too
flat
for
my
liking
again
i
dont
know
if
that
is
the
tap
or
if
thats
just
the
way
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
ive
never
had
a
problem
with
their
levels
of
co2
before
though
the
drinkability
was
more
unpleasant
as
you
continued
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
not
something
id
drink
every
night
though
probably
more
a
factor
of
cost
than
desire
mouth
is
fairly
prickly
and
tingly
actually
a
nice
compliment
to
the
sourness
this
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
the
sour
is
fantastic
and
i
love
this
take
on
the
wild
ale
definitely
will
seek
out
again
nice
stuff
d
another
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
from
allagash
this
beer
just
got
better
and
better
as
i
made
my
way
through
the
bottle
great
balance
good
flavors
and
very
nice
with
spaghetti
and
some
chicken
with
italian
spices
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
the
style
i
feel
its
a
little
pricey
at
22
a
bottle
maybe
the
other
bottle
i
picked
up
will
be
better
in
another
year
or
so
i
dont
think
ill
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
anytime
soon
nor
will
i
be
tempted
to
pick
up
another
a
beligan
triple
quality
with
a
brett
twist
and
a
flavor
range
that
seems
to
be
in
the
midst
of
all
that
pour
is
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
head
of
about
a
finger
nose
of
tart
and
mild
fruity
geuze
quality
palate
of
brett
and
strawberries
and
cherries
crisp
enough
to
not
detect
the
alcohol
thought
it
was
about
6
actually
not
too
bright
to
contort
the
pollen
malty
finish
a
difference
to
a
belgian
geuze
with
a
distiction
of
zesty
floral
and
distinct
fruit
qualities

i
can
taste
the
alcohol
and
can
feel
it
warming
my
throat
i
try
not
to
compare
it
to
other
beers
but
knowing
consecration
is
a
10
beer
aged
in
wine
barrels
i
cant
help
bud
do
so
id
take
a
rr
over
this
any
day
exceptionally
well
crafted
beer
there
are
a
couple
of
things
i
would
change
but
hard
to
complain
with
what
the
people
of
allagash
accomplished
the
beer
has
a
light
body
with
a
full
carbonation
that
makes
a
light
feel
on
the
tongue
d
it
drank
really
good
and
was
a
solid
wild
ale
that
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
again
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
supplications
little
sister
but
the
cherry
flavor
was
more
mild
hv
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
allagash
but
their
beers
are
unavailable
out
here
so
my
opportunities
to
sample
are
limited
having
recently
picked
this
one
up
in
a
trade
i
was
excited
to
renew
my
acquaintances
with
this
brewery
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
little
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
quite
a
while
aromas
of
brett
white
grapes
light
oak
pears
and
green
apples
light
bodied
crisp
tart
white
wine
apples
and
wellhidden
alcohol
another
great
beer
from
allagash
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
however
the
different
flavors
didnt
seem
to
meld
terribly
well
still
its
worth
a
shot
taste
is
bret
sour
a
bit
but
the
main
flavor
i
have
is
merlot
a
dark
red
wine
it
also
has
that
dry
red
wine
finish
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
the
sour
fades
and
the
merlot
comes
through
i
really
wish
this
was
more
sour
the
nose
lets
you
think
it
is
crazy
sour
but
the
taste
is
disappointing
if
that
was
what
you
were
looking
for
the
more
i
dig
into
this
the
more
i
dislike
it
if
you
are
a
merlot
fan
this
is
for
you
if
you
dont
like
red
wine
like
me
dont
buy
this
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
and
was
a
very
good
beer
overall
it
had
some
very
nice
sour
and
tart
flavors
without
becoming
too
extreme
paired
great
with
dinner
tonight
too
2009
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
an
allagash
flute
poured
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
white
head
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
apple
cider
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
sweet
almost
sugary
apple
cider
and
dark
fruit
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
nice
wild
ale
the
feel
on
the
palate
with
the
high
carbonation
was
quite
nice
and
refreshing
for
me
throughout
this
one
the
flavors
were
spoton
and
not
overpowering
as
you
can
get
a
massive
sour
aftertaste
with
some
of
these
style
brews
this
is
a
definite
must
try
d
good
beer
with
good
balance
and
nice
drinkability
but
its
definitely
one
better
to
share
with
a
few
other
wild
friends
d
very
enjoyable
wild
love
the
funky
bretti
character
here
combined
with
the
oak
and
the
complex
fruitiness
this
one
is
a
winner
9
5
really
not
really
sensing
this
probably
means
disaster
is
waiting
ahead
of
me
but
oh
well
this
is
so
good
im
easily
finishing
the
bottle
on
my
own
drinkabilitythe
tartness
definitely
ensures
this
beer
is
far
from
cloying
and
the
fruity
flavors
can
get
rather
addictive
with
successive
sips
for
what
its
worth
and
costs
this
beer
is
dangerous
on
the
drinkability
i
was
starting
to
think
allagash
beers
wernt
worth
the
premium
price
point
but
this
certainly
changed
my
view
d
very
easy
drinking
this
would
be
a
great
starter
wild
for
someone
whos
just
getting
into
the
style
hard
to
beleive
this
is
9
5
abv
i
found
no
trace
at
all
d
i
like
this
wild
ale
its
got
a
harmonius
balance
and
feel
with
a
solid
drinkable
body
would
be
curious
what
a
few
years
of
age
would
do
to
it
its
lightly
carbonated
a
little
peppery
mouthfeel
matches
the
style
nicely
the
9
5
abv
isnt
noticeable
very
drinkable
and
delicious
d
it
is
hard
to
rate
in
a
traditional
sense
as
this
drinks
like
a
really
dry
and
complex
red
wine
but
i
am
really
enjoying
it
i
wish
every
day
was
open
a
cool
bottle
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
because
it
is
tuesday
day
this
is
a
fantastic
take
on
the
wild
ale
by
allagash
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
20
for
a
bottle
notes
this
is
an
amazing
beer
people
should
be
talking
about
it
more
and
drinking
more
of
it
one
of
the
best
wild
ales
ive
tasted
way
to
go
holy
cow
this
is
killer
beer
with
an
aggressive
pour
i
get
a
small
to
medium
sized
cream
colored
head
that
soon
settled
out
and
no
lace
color
is
a
hazy
apricot
aroma
is
fantastic
literally
with
yeast
brett
malt
wine
fruitiness
caramel
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
has
the
acid
from
the
yeastoids
and
gas
to
cut
through
the
sweet
malts
and
residual
sweetness
of
the
wine
barrels
along
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
yeast
complex
body
is
very
good
and
too
the
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
includes
alcohol
warming
would
be
good
both
before
and
after
a
great
meal
d
a
very
nice
allagash
beer
with
some
nice
sour
cherries
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
like
to
have
again
dextremely
drinkable
and
tasty
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
sour
light
acidity
to
balance
with
a
great
oak
aginging
imparting
oak
vanilla
and
vinous
characteristics
the
red
fruit
qualities
are
much
more
prevalent
in
this
beer
than
the
09
d
probably
not
worth
the
price
overall
a
nice
complex
and
enjoyable
wild
ale
the
wine
barrel
aging
seems
to
give
this
a
nice
sweetness
and
complexity
that
matches
well
with
the
brett
an
enjoyable
sipping
wild
ale
at
the
allagash
promo
recently
at
the
coppermine
pub
in
north
arlington
nj
into
a
tulip
poured
a
golden
hue
with
one
finger
of
white
head
with
decent
retention
the
nose
was
very
impressive
lots
of
brett
yeast
with
some
sour
raspberry
and
numerous
spices
including
clove
and
cinnamon
the
flavor
was
even
more
impressive
very
wineyberry
start
combined
with
brett
funk
dissolving
to
a
more
sour
midpalate
and
then
finally
crisp
sugary
finish
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
very
interesting
flavor
progression
to
say
the
least
mediumbodied
spritzy
mouthfeel
excellent
refreshing
substitute
for
a
lambic
or
summer
ale
amber
gold
with
an
off
white
head
that
thins
quickly
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
smell
is
very
vinous
and
fruity
at
first
there
is
a
bit
of
wood
in
the
background
the
funkiness
of
the
brett
is
also
noticeable
in
the
smell
im
not
a
huge
sour
ale
fan
but
i
do
have
to
say
that
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
taste
of
this
beer
up
front
this
tastes
very
much
like
a
wine
although
it
has
enough
beer
characteristics
to
make
it
clear
that
it
isnt
wine
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
and
hop
in
the
background
along
with
the
acidic
character
of
the
brettanomyces
make
it
clear
it
is
beer
very
complex
though
altogether
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
very
dry
the
acidity
of
the
brett
and
moderate
carbonation
combine
to
make
this
very
tart
so
this
is
very
good
im
definitely
a
fan
and
will
have
to
seek
out
more
examples
of
this
style
the
mouthfeel
dries
up
quickly
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
drinkability
seems
good
after
the
first
glass
but
bret
usually
wears
on
me
pretty
quickly
overall
this
is
the
most
enjoyable
wild
ale
ive
had
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
cant
see
this
one
getting
old
at
all
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
sourness
is
there
but
never
oppressive
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
bit
rich
and
indecisive
for
me
the
funk
sour
and
wine
just
dont
come
together
enough
but
i
respect
the
intent
and
think
it
others
might
have
a
very
different
opinion
notes
exotic
and
interesting
this
is
a
beer
where
i
enjoy
the
aroma
much
more
than
the
flavor
interesting
but
the
astringency
is
really
powerful
d
the
drinkability
is
high
mainly
because
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
so
incredible
but
also
because
your
palate
wont
experience
the
same
type
of
fatigue
that
comes
with
other
heavy
hitting
wild
ales
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
allagash
a
brewery
that
i
have
come
to
expect
great
things
from
abv
is
a
bit
high
to
put
away
more
than
one
but
i
will
definitely
snatch
interlude
up
as
often
as
i
see
it
d
id
tear
this
bad
boy
up
and
drink
every
bit
of
the
mass
production
of
it
overall
allagash
interlude
is
a
nice
beer
but
doesnt
really
deliver
i
enjoyed
it
a
little
more
than
the
confluence
but
it
still
didnt
really
impress
me
i
think
allagash
has
a
nice
base
beer
going
on
here
but
it
needs
something
a
little
more
still
enjoyable
to
drink
and
worth
checking
out
if
you
havent
tried
it
a
fantastic
example
of
the
diversity
of
american
brewing
and
a
primo
crossover
beer
for
wine
drinkers
it
is
complex
and
bold
enough
to
challenge
most
wines
on
its
own
or
when
pairing
stand
it
up
against
a
stinky
cheese
smoked
salmon
or
charcuterie
plate
this
beer
is
well
balanced
all
around
and
was
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
it
plays
nicely
on
the
tongue
and
was
certainly
drinkable
will
be
looking
for
this
again
and
may
have
to
pick
up
a
bottle
another
strong
beer
from
allagash
the
sour
and
funky
character
is
somewhat
understated
as
this
is
a
saison
first
and
a
wild
second
the
finish
is
dry
and
satisfying
easily
my
favorite
regular
offering
from
allagash
this
trumps
the
2009
that
i
had
on
tap
recently
i
would
like
to
grab
a
couple
of
these
to
age
to
see
how
they
develop

drinkability
is
very
good
overall
its
a
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
the
flavors
hit
the
tongue
in
layers
its
very
deep
complex
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
bought
a
bottle
to
add
to
my
beer
collection
i
may
try
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
stuff
overall
a
really
cool
beer
the
palate
opens
with
plenty
of
brett
with
a
blend
of
clove
and
bandaid
and
plenty
of
citrus
with
an
orange
juicelike
character
some
more
fruit
i
get
a
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
peach
juice
and
some
spice
coming
through
midpalate
and
along
with
the
clove
theres
a
nutmegmace
like
character
the
red
wine
is
also
noticeable
lingering
on
into
the
finish
that
is
drying
with
a
little
citrus
spice
and
bandaid
as
well
excellent
stuff
this
is
the
best
allagash
beer
out
there
of
all
the
times
ive
had
this
beer
i
think
this
time
was
the
best
does
talking
to
mr
rob
tod
while
imbibing
make
it
better
interlude
by
allagash
is
a
wild
ale
aged
in
french
merlot
and
sirah
oak
barrels
9

abv
it
poured
a
deep
sienna
orange
brown
without
any
head
it
smelled
of
cherry
dark
fruits
malt
toffee
and
some
red
wine
it
tasted
like
lemons
malt
caramel
touch
of
vanilla
oak
and
a
sour
ending
with
a
dry
finish
it
is
very
wine
like
but
it
seems
a
bit
off
theres
some
astringency
going
on
with
some
phenol
and
solvent
characters
not
a
good
sign
amazing
the
flavors
meld
seamlessly
and
the
9

is
nowhere
to
be
found
allagash
your
my
hero
today
allagash
once
again
lives
up
to
and
exceeds
my
expectations
of
a
great
brewery
very
well
done
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
belgian
goblet
the
beer
has
a
hazy
golden
almost
red
tint
to
it
foams
up
pretty
nice
upon
pouring
but
doesnt
leave
too
much
lacing
behind
aroma
is
pleasant
but
slightly
disappointing
theres
a
good
deal
of
funk
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
the
tangy
and
sour
notes
that
i
would
expect
out
of
a
barrel
age
brett
fermented
wild
ale
taste
is
nice
as
well
but
falls
a
bit
short
of
my
expectations
theres
a
smoothness
to
the
beer
that
is
pleasant
but
it
lacks
the
lively
acidity
that
i
was
hoping
for
its
a
very
balanced
beer
but
gets
to
be
a
little
boring
after
a
while
overall
this
is
far
from
a
bad
beer
but
didnt
strike
me
as
wonderful
perhaps
i
went
into
it
with
the
wrong
mindset
but
i
probably
wont
be
dropping
the
22
bones
to
try
this
one
again
the
finish
is
dry
and
had
a
slightly
unappetizing
bitterness
sad
end
but
on
a
whole
definitely
worth
the
money
d
very
drinkable
ill
easily
drink
the
whole
750ml
bottle
d
absolutely
outstanding
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
drinks
very
similar
to
a
saison
id
drink
this
with
a
freshripened
goat
cheese
a
hearty
rustic
charcuterie
plate
or
with
a
big
heaping
plate
of
sweet
potato
fries
an
absolute
musthave
go
find
a
bottle
right
now
pours
a
dark
golden
copper
with
a
fairly
slight
head
that
leaves
a
good
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
a
lot
of
citrus
green
apple
ripe
fruits
brett
and
a
bit
of
acid
taste
is
quite
similar
a
lot
going
on
here
and
in
addition
to
the
nose
i
picked
up
a
bit
from
the
barrels
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
some
puckering
qualities
but
nothing
too
harsh
a
bit
sweet
in
addition
to
the
sour
this
would
be
more
of
an
everyday
drinking
sour
very
drinkable
all
around
consumed
3122010
i
think
the
beer
is
better
with
bottle
conditioning
than
on
tap
its
one
of
those
rare
things
cheers
overall
impression
a
very
complex
beer
that
had
too
much
of
a
winelike
flavor
for
my
palate
it
is
no
doubt
an
excellent
beer
but
the
flavor
combination
did
not
work
for
me
at
19
99
tax
i
would
advise
against
trying
it
unless
youre
big
on
wine
this
is
my
first
wild
ale
and
i
am
quite
frightened
pours
a
strange
hazy
light
brownpink
small
bubbly
offwhite
head
sticks
around
decently
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
smell
is
faint
sour
berry
a
little
funky
the
taste
is
great
not
nearly
as
harsh
as
i
thought
it
would
be
lemon
berries
a
little
sour
but
not
overly
so
at
all
kind
of
a
pink
starburst
and
raspberry
lemonade
vibe
definitely
a
white
wine
vibe
here
as
well
alcohol
is
wellhidden
i
want
to
give
the
taste
a
4
5
but
it
gets
a
bit
tiring
over
time
theres
not
much
to
it
after
the
first
couple
ounces
it
seems
one
glass
was
enough
for
me
for
a
bomber
i
would
probably
have
to
split
it
with
someone
long
finish
a
nice
change
for
sure
from
ipasstouts
i
enjoyed
it
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
wild
ales
i
can
see
why
people
like
the
style
so
much
and
the
complexities
that
can
be
derived
from
it
a
very
excellent
belgian
strong
from
the
folks
at
allagash
well
worth
a
taste
especially
if
you
enjoy
sour
ales
or
just
belgian
ales
in
general
deliciousness
in
a
glass
yum
its
a
good
brew
but
not
great
for
18
i
expect
greatness
considering
the
pricetag
i
see
little
reason
to
revisit
this
brew
nicely
done
from
allagash
poured
a
medium
to
smallish
head
while
releasing
an
interesting
and
pleasing
aroma
notes
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
as
perhaps
some
apple
or
otherwise
fruity
taste
complex
and
a
bit
difficult
to
pinpoint
but
nonetheless
delightful
perhaps
the
oak
barrels
give
it
that
difficult
to
corner
taste
a
smooth
mouthfeel
albeit
for
a
touch
of
crisp
also
very
dry
even
before
the
aftertaste
on
the
lighter
side
for
such
a
complex
beer
definitely
interesting
and
it
does
grow
on
you
doesnt
quite
justify
the
price
tag
though
d
glad
that
i
tried
this
unique
offering
id
sum
it
up
as
complex
with
several
layers
of
flavor
however
i
probably
wouldnt
specifically
seek
this
one
out
to
try
again
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
all
around
its
a
good
beer
however
this
beer
isnt
as
good
as
the
sum
of
its
parts
for
some
reason
i
dont
think
this
is
memorable
in
any
way
its
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
expected
and
while
good
and
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
would
have
this
again
pours
a
murky
orangishbrown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
sour
with
oak
sour
apple
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
tart
apple
with
oak
lemon
and
vanilla
the
beer
finishes
very
dry
making
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
it
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
sour
that
has
a
lot
of
flavors
besides
just
sourness
the
alcohol
is
almost
imperceptible
so
be
carful
willing
to
pay
the
high
price
to
enjoy
more
pours

dark

medium

and
light

i
have
to
say
that
i
reall
y
loved
the
color
of
this
beer
but
thats
where
the
love
affair
ended
for
me
light
berry
notes
on
the
nose
grassy
heavy
mustiness
and
little
to
no
sourness
flavor
is
unripened
berry
really
no
sweetness
or
tartness
in
this
one
just
sort
of
a
muddled
funk
of
a
brew
musty
earthy
some
funky
cheese
at
times
where
is
the
sour
on
this
one
this
brew
really
needs
some
bugs
in
here
to
make
things
shine
this
is
too
brettforward
and
the
funkiness
needs
to
be
offset
by
some
sweetness
or
sourness
or
both
dry
finish
translates
into
a
dry
beer
overall
but
without
the
tartness
to
balance
things
out
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
this
brew
too
much
brett
funk
and
not
enough
sour
and
im
not
really
a
fan
of
these
type
of
wilds
reminds
me
of
the
mediocrity
that
was
perseguidor
5
d
very
good
even
at
9
5
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
but
the
price
was
holding
me
back
at
17
99
glad
i
finally
splurged
very
good
and
i
would
buy
again
but
only
for
a
special
occasion
bottled
in
december
of
2009
poured
slowly
from
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
into
a
red
wine
glass
pours
a
brownishorange
color
like
a
cider
in
appearance
no
head
of
any
substance
and
very
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
but
it
seems
very
carbonated
smells
of
funk
and
brett
oaky
and
with
wine
like
qualities
the
barrel
aging
did
some
nice
things
for
the
overall
complexity
of
this
brew
pear
and
overall
fruit
flavors
are
apparent
along
with
the
funkiness
and
bready
notes
i
found
it
to
be
mild
and
restrained
for
a
wild
very
little
sourness
to
it
this
is
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
with
delicious
winelike
qualities
i
was
however
slightly
disappointed
this
time
i
have
had
only
bottles
and
had
this
on
tap
and
felt
that
this
particular
one
was
slightly
lackluster
and
over
carbonated
i
think
some
age
will
do
this
beer
well
luckily
i
have
two
older
bottles
tucked
away
in
my
basement
i
cant
wait
to
review
this
beer
again
in
a
few
months
drinkability
the
abv
holds
it
back
and
the
strong
caramel
with
the
lemony
brett
isnt
the
best
pairing
so
id
say
this
beer
was
much
better
fressh
and
the
current
flavor
profile
also
contributes
to
my
lower
score
in
this
category
drinks
pretty
well
i
guess
its
got
close
to
twice
the
alcohol
of
most
of
the
sour
beers
ive
had
not
one
of
the
outstanding
examples
but
by
all
means
an
enjoyable
one
d
a
nice
offering
from
allagash
i
found
it
to
be
slightly
more
enjoyable
than
confluence
and
some
of
their
other
beers
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
and
would
have
no
problem
with
having
it
again
the
feel
is
on
the
low
end
of
the
funky
side
with
a
mild
spritz
the
carb
is
at
a
nice
level
a
easy
drinking
belgian
strong
that
is
kind
of
hard
to
identify
crisp
and
refreshing
i
only
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
i
need
more
of
this
year
another
intriguing
and
contemplative
wild
for
me
an
interesting
style
but
once
every
now
and
again
is
good
enough
for
me
is
a
beer
worth
20
bucks
this
one
definitely
is
wonderful
scents
of
grapes
and
sweetness
excellent
drinkablilty
however
catches
up
with
you
rather
quickly
due
to
how
well
it
does
go
down
oak
comes
through
nicely
but
not
overwhelming
interesting
mix
of
sweet
and
dry
with
the
finish
id
love
to
be
able
to
try
an
older
bottle
to
compare
but
from
what
ive
seen
here
it
can
only
get
better
md
light
body
with
crisp
carbonation
lingers
on
the
lips
you
can
feel
the
alcohol
warmth
this
is
my
first
wild
ale
so
it
is
difficult
to
compare
i
usually
associate
sourness
with
something
gone
wrong
but
this
is
a
pleasant
tartness
very
refreshing
cant
drink
too
many
of
them
due
to
the
alcohol
the
halfpint
was
a
nice
serving
size
definitely
recommend
this
beer
particularly
to
other
wild
ale
newbies
and
i
would
have
it
again
md
slightly
old
or
more
mellow
flavors
seem
to
be
slightly
dull
but
very
enjoyable
and
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
allagash
but
you
can
count
me
as
a
huge
fan
after
experiencing
interlude
i
stand
by
my
statement
this
is
indeed
a
special
beer
its
expertly
crafted
allaround
and
doesnt
really
have
any
glaring
flaws
personally
id
like
a
little
more
belgian
yeast
flavor
but
thats
really
nitpicking
this
is
great
stuff
definitely
worth
seeking
out
trade
for
it
if
you
must
its
well
worth
it
some
good
funk
going
here
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
sour
sweet
and
dry
i
didnt
get
to
try
this
back
in
05
when
the
beer
was
released
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
not
overly
sour
so
there
is
accessibility
for
beginners
to
the
wild
ale
scene
id
be
interested
in
trying
other
years
highest
recommendation
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
despite
its
sour
character
and
high
abv
it
is
nicely
balanced
between
the
complex
sour
funk
and
the
rich
malt
the
malt
notes
are
quite
rich
and
creamy
for
a
sour
beer
and
they
are
accentuated
by
the
oak
aging
the
final
impression
is
of
a
complex
and
somewhat
saison
like
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
anything
that
i
am
overly
impressed
but
solid
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
however
i
do
wish
it
had
some
other
bugs
in
it
d
quite
an
easy
to
drink
wild
ale
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
as
a
beer
good
but
as
a
wild
ale
nothing
special
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
the
sourness
is
no
overpowering
but
actually
very
refreshing
wishing
it
came
in
more
than
a
8oz
serving
this
beer
is
rad
i
was
really
apprehensive
about
a
return
to
wild
yeast
for
myself
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
need
to
grab
a
few
more
of
these
for
dinner
parties
ddrinkability
im
having
a
hard
time
with
this
one
the
old
wine
flavors
dont
really
invite
me
to
take
another
sip
marmalade
melon
with
a
lightly
phenolic
finish
leading
to
a
tart
kick
not
as
tart
as
a
nice
gueuzewild
could
be
a
little
twang
that
makes
it
slightly
rough
around
the
edges
but
this
was
improved
by
letting
the
bottle
breath
and
warm
to
room
temperature
just
a
little
off
cant
really
put
my
finger
on
it
overall
a
nice
wild
that
may
benefit
from
a
little
more
time
in
the
barrel
the
feel
is
ok
not
totally
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
this
a
nice
hybrid
type
beer
to
cross
the
gap
to
wine
drinkers
as
well
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
off
for
me
for
some
reason
really
interesting
and
worth
the
price
tag
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
wild
ale
but
still
something
i
would
recommend
this
is
a
beer
that
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
it
seems
pretty
unique
amongst
its
wild
ale
brethren
for
being
so
influenced
by
the
world
of
wine
this
is
so
worth
trying
d
rated
good
because
so
strong
and
because
of
the
price
point
would
have
given
a
higher
review
but
is
very
expensive
but
would
want
another
given
the
abv
and
how
well
this
holds
up
overall
this
beer
was
interesting
the
wild
in
this
beer
takes
on
an
earthy
yeast
flavor
along
with
plenty
of
brett
the
grape
tannins
and
vinous
attributes
offer
an
interesting
dichotomy
within
the
beer
itself
overall
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
two
glasses
of
this
was
my
limit
but
i
enjoyed
every
drop
it
is
somewhat
pricey
but
worth
it
for
a
special
occasion

overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
was
happy
to
try
the
high
price
tag
would
perhaps
deter
me
from
buying
another
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
at
least
once
d
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
this
beer
are
big
big
enough
that
i
can
truly
enjoy
a
glass
of
this
beer
but
not
any
more
than
one
glass
overall
a
curious
brew
but
well
worth
trying
if
youre
looking
for
something
new
and
interesting

it
a
shot

well
balanced
and

beer
allagash
interlude
pours
a

light
copper
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet

and
sour
tart
funk
the
aroma
is
mild
and
it
is
hard
to
pick
up
on
the
complexity
the
flavor
is
sharp
upfront
a
mix
of
tart
bitterness
and
carbonation
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
mixing
together
here
green
apple
tart
fruit
and
earthy
vinous
notes
there
is
a
characterist
funk
from
the
brett
but
it
is
more
along
the
lines
of
sour
there
is
a
hint
of
oak
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
sharp
d
pretty
drinkable
mild
sour
that
allows
you
to
drink
the
bottle
all
by
yourself
for
me
the
overall
flavor
lacks
a
defining
characteristic
the
wine
is
very
mellow
the
brett
is
present
on
aroma
sediment
pour
but
is
too
mellow
for
me
i
wonder
if
the
9
5
on
this
one
prevented
a
bigger
brett
profile
easy
drinker
and
an
excellent
bottle
to
share
even
after
about
a
year
the
heat
of
the
alcohol
shows
i
do
like
the
aroma
passed
up
many
opportunities
to
have
this
beer
up
until
now
not
sure
why
i
know
russian
rivers
sours
get
a
lot
of
buzz
here
in
the
north
east
i
guess
because
they
are
scarce
in
the
area
but
we
take
for
granted
what
great
brews
we
have
coming
from
places
like
allagash
that
are
so
easy
to
come
by
out
here
flavor
has
much
more
brett
and
funk
than
the
nose
will
let
on
wonderful
bretty
and

perfect
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
this
lively
and
dance
around

mouth
the
barrel
effects
really
shine
through
in
this
beer
wonderful
beer
ill
definitely
pick
up
one
or
two
more
of
these
and
put
them
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
time
will
do
to
them
md
light
to
medium

carbonation
is
very
subtle
but
there
drinkability
is
decent
overall
not
the
best
wild
ale
ive
had
perhaps
its
better
fresh
solid
but
nothing
great
d
it
calls
to
you
i
dont
think
i
need
to
say
anything
else
silky

is
well
carbonated

is
a
bit
thin
but
has
lasting
vinous
presence
another
tasty
bottle
from

d
reminded
me
of
a
gargamel
light
really
an
excellent
wild
ale
i
really
do
like
allagashs
strain
of
brett
at
18

it
was
a
pricy
treat
but
a
damn
fine

super
foamy

drunk
apr
2009
this
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
peach
and
honeysuckle
and
clover
with
wild
yeast
and
salt
and
a
bit
of
lemon
and
alcohol
it
tasted
like
orange
peel
and
peach
wild
honey
and
wild
yeast
and
salt
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
sweet
spices
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
tart
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
delicate
beer
with
nice
flavor
and
a
decent
body
it
wasnt
exciting
to
me
as
i
prefer
richer
and
darker
flavors
in
belgian
ales
i
was
also
surprised
this
didnt
have
a
stronger
oak
character
which
could
have
nicely
added
to
the
beers
complexity
im
not
sure
if
age
would
improve
this
or
not
its
nicely
brewed
and
enjoyable
fresh
but
not
great
for
my
personal
taste

i
want

yes
would
i
shell
out

for

of
this

special
occasions
easily
this
was
a
well
crafted
beer
everything
knit
together
perfectly
crisp

refreshing
the

definitely
hides
the

pretty

just

paired

d
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
however
the
amount
one
could
drink
in
a
night
is
fairly
limited
by
the
high
alcohol
content
it
is
a
great
beer
to
go
with
food
i
enjoyed

with
a

and
a

a

underwhelming
i
hoped
for
a
little
more

that
improves
as

i
had
one

of
it

found
it

d
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
beer
it
is
good
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
its
quite
dry
and
the
hops
seem
to
have
faded
though
the
oak
makes
itself
known
allagash
always
does
a
nice
job
with
their
beers
and
this
one
is
no
different
drinkability
great
especially
for
the
brettanomyces
they
have
tamed
the
wild
yeast
quite
well
personally
i
prefer
their
other
offerings
a
tad
more
this
one
is
a
complex

not
my

d
oh
so
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
i
actually
found
the
taste
to
be
pretty
disappointing
after
such
a
good
start
like
i
said
this
is
a
lively
beer
to
the
point
that
it
has
champagne

still
enjoyed

i
liked
the

very
much

i

what
to
expect
since
i
havent
had
many
belgian
strong
pale
ales
i
would
try
this
again
and
suggest
it
for
someone
whos
into
belgian
beers
in
a
big
way
drinkability
this
one
improved
greatly
as
it
warmed
but
also
as
i
got
into
it
and
after
about
half
the
glass
at
first
i
didnt
find
myself
rushing
to
finish
this
one
but
letting
it
warm
for
about
2030
minutes
i
was
all
over
it
to
me
this
deal
cant
be
too
warm
but
if
its
colder
youre
really
missing
out
wellconstructed
pours
a
glowing
honeygolden
color
rapidly
diminishing
offwhite
head
leaves
just
a
handful
of
spots
on
the
glass
the
smells
coming
out
of
the
glass
are
almost
more
than
i
can
even
process
sourness
earthy
funky
some
sugary
vanilla
aromas
wow
and
amazingly
enough
all
the
aromas
are
showing
up
in
the
flavors
with
some
more
fruitiness
throwing
down
straddling
the
line
between
fullbodied
and
the
heavy
end
of
mediumbodied
some
spicy
alcohol
on
the
lips
and
bellywarming
alcohol
as
well
i
need
more
of
this
pours
just
shy
of
an
amber
color
with
a
brilliant
white
head
on
top
smells
strongly
of
brett
funk
with
a
hint
of
oak
barrel
as
well
tastes
slightly
sour
and
tart
full
of
tannins
somewhat
fruity
and
with
a
crisp
belgian
pale
backbone
holding
it
all
together
really
an
amazing
beer
mouthfeel
matches
the
smell
and
drinkability
is
phenomenal
my
favorite
allagash
brew
so
far
i
wish
this
were
more
available
to
me
d
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
gratifying
my
only
slight
complaints
are
in
the
lack
of
head
and
the
price
point
at
23
a
bottle
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
one
as
much
as
id
like
split
a
750
ml
bottle
w
my
brother
pours
with
a
fairly
small
white
head
that
dissipates
after
a
few
minutes
into
a
thin
layer
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
color

a
goldamber
pretty
clear
effervescent
smell
is
out
of
this
world
some
definite
wildyeast
aromas
going
on
reminds
me
of
a
gueuze
in
a
lot
of
ways
aroma
is
some
lemon
mixed
with
a
bit
of
jolly
rancher
green
apple
and
some
watermelon
taste
falls
a
bit
flat
the
funky
sourness
promised
by
the
nose
isnt
really
reflected
in
the
taste
taste
is
some
caramel
and
some
spicy
hops
but
the
finish
is
a
touch
of
sourness
and
substantial
alcohol
burn
the
booziness
is
fairly
prominent
and
hurts
the
drinkability
but
the
aroma
is
fantastic
definitely
worth
trying
especially
since
they
used
a
brettanomyces
strain
from
maine
if
they
could
tame
the
alcohol
a
bit
and
get
just
a
touch
more
sourness
this
would
be
worldclass
a
highly
drinkable
offering
while
you
cant
necessarily
taste
the
9
5
abv
there
is
a
boozy
quality
that
makes
me
want
to
pace
myself
a
solid
beerespecially
when
considering
the
delicate
nature
of
a
belgian

there

no

allow

to

not

but
one
for
an
evening
reading
a

by

fireplace
december
2007
bottle
bought
at
the
same
time
as
the
bottle
reviewed
above
and
cellared
the
profile
is
quite
similar
surprisingly
it
hasnt
changed
much
but
it
is
a
bit
subdued
not
quite
as
exuberant
as
it
was
fresh
was
probably
better
fresh
but
still
a
very
tasty
and
complex
beer
extremely
drinkable
a
great
beer
drinkability
isnt
that
hot
cramped
by
the
outrageous
price
it
was
even
harder
to
enjoy
then
had
i
only
paid
10
for
it
which
is
certainly
a
fair
price
compared
to
many
of
the
other
brett
beers
being
put
out
by
us
craft
brewers
but
to
charge
what
they
do
they
need
to
be
offering
a
masterpiece
not

good
750ml
bottle
from

in

2007
vintage
pours
a
virtually
translucent
amberred
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
smells
sweet
fruity
and
souracidic
tastes
fruity
bready
and
sourfunky
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
flavors
are
extremely
subtle
and
balanced
mediumbodied
with
surprisingly
low
carbonation
wow
this
beer
is
the
most
unique
beer
i
have
ever
encountered
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
had
delightfully
sourfunky
but
not
a
sour
bomb
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
very
wellcrafted
doubt
even
at
the
cost
about
17
per
bottle
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
up
more
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
have
a
bottle
of
2007
and
2005
aging
now
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
wide
mouth
goblet
a
nice
honey
color
with
a
thick
head
i
couldnt
smell
a
thing
which
disappointed
me
however
this
isnt
the
first
beer
this
has
happened
to
so
i
am
not
sure
what
to
make
of
that
maybe
im
losing
my
sense
of
smell
i
took
a
taste
vanilla
cream
and
a
fruitiness
i
couldnt
quite
identify
the
fruit
the
beer
felt
nice
and
creamy
and
soft
on
my
tongue
really
easy
to
drink
one
concern
i
have
about
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
that
you
cant
tell
it
is
9
5abv
and
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
its
got
not
to
be
whacked
in
the
face
with
an
alcohol
taste
just
a
little
too
much
oak
while
other
flavors
are
too
dulled
and
thus
overpowered
what
happened
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
at
the
ebf
but
now
meh
this
is
quite
an
interesting
complex
and
very
well
crafted
brew
the
flavor
profile
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
allagash
line
but
it
is
still
a
stellar
beer
definitely
worth
picking
up
giving
the
high
abv
this
beer
was
a
delight
to
sit
and
savor
during
the
course
of
the
night
i
quickly
began
to
enjoy
the
full
body
texture
this
beer
had
to
offer
as
it
warmed
slight
in
the
glass
tangy

sparkling
carbonation
in

one
of
the
best
american
belgianstyle
beers
around
2007
bottle
there
was
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
bottle
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
wonderful
herbal
funkiness
running
throughout
it
was
wellbalanced
with
plenty
of
flavor
running
through
the
midpalate
and
long
finish
quite
a
nice
way
to
end
the
night
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
750ml
bottle
into
a
dogfish
head
oversized
wine
goblet
the
body
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
just
off
white
head
that
keeps
a
nice
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
a
fair
amount
of
foam
across
the
top
of
the
beer
some
lacing
also
remains
on
the
sides
the
aroma
displays
tart
apples
with
caramel
and
chardonnay
along
with
some
spiciness
the
flavor
hits
you
first
again
with
the
tart
apples
but
the
spiciness
from
the
farmhouse
yeast
lingers
throughout
and
is
then
complimented
beautifully
by
the
tart
character
of
the
brettanomyces
and
some
caramel
sweetness
the
beer
exhibits
a
medium
body
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
but
a
bit
of
dryness
from
the
oak
this
combined
with
the
tart
edge
provides
the
drinker
with
a
rather
refreshing
beverage
the
beer
seems
to
be
a
saison
belgian
strong
pale
ale
and
flemish
sour
ale
all
in
one
that
is
fine
by
me
seeing
they
are
all
great
styles
it
is
pretty
intense
making
it
more
drinkable
to
split
the
bottle
three
ways
and
can
become
overwhelming
over
the
course
of
an
entire
bottle
by
ones
self
still
it
a
great
beer
as
one
would
expect
from
allagash
light
bronze
with
a
full
lasting
foam
lots
of
depth
in
the
nose
with
hints
wine
stained
oak
fruit
and
funk
lots
of
taste
with
hints
of
oak
a
caressing
funkiness
and
light
fruits
vinous
character
showing
light
hints
of
red
fruits
authentic
and
unique
its
quite
an
ale
d
excellent
impressive
overall
this
beer
needs
to
be
reclassified
as
a
belgian
sour
not
a
bsp
in
many
aspects
its
drinkable
but
not
in
the
best
way
especially
considering
the
price
of
a
bottle
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
definitely
a
different
take
on
the
style
and
the
complexity
was
just
excellent
overall
i
was
shocked
by
how
the
aroma
differed
from
the
flavor
though
both
were
well
above
par
its
a
pricy
one
at
20
a
bottle
but
it
is
something
that
is
well
worth
a
try
another
winner
from
allagash
overall
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
in
my
humble
opinion
they
make
much
better
varieties
this
2007
sample
i
had
missed
the
mark
tastes
like
the
sour
up
front
not
very
much
yeastiness
but
a
pretty
nice
selection
of
fruit
this
moves
into
a
seltzery
middle
and
ends
on
a
lingering
sour
node
thats
quite
pleasant
but
not
really
what
i
was
thinking
id
get
out
of
an
oak
aged
belgian
pale
drinkability
heres
my
problem
i
found
it
to
be
overly
tart
sharply
so
and
a
bit
heavy
on
the
oak
for
me
this
left
the
overall
taste
to
be
rather
disjointed
with
nothing
really
coming
together
for
me
a
very
great
tasting
beer
if
only
the
head
had
better
retention
with
aroma
release
it
would
probably
push
it
to
a
perfect
score
excellent
beer
all
around
quite
complex
on
the
palate
and
well
balanced
the
funk
is
well
integrated
and
not
overwhelming
im
not
sure
its
worth
about
20
a
bottle
but
then
again
what
is
drinkability
its
a
good
thing
i
had
only
one
bottle
of
this
because
i
would
have
drunk
it
until
i
lost
consciousness
its
that
good
and
although
you
feel
the
high
abv
the
tartness
makes
it
so
quenching
that
it
goes
down
smooth
if
its
not
obvious
i
really
like
this
beer
and
even
though
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
would
urge
everyone
to
give
it
a
shot
at
least
once
this
is
just
fabulous
stuff
one
of
the
best
and
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
probably
my
very
favorite
allagash
beer
ever
im
becoming
a
real
sucker
for
these
sour
beers
this
one
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
splendid
mouthfeel
allagash
has
let
me
down
a
bit
recently
but
this
one
hit
the
mark
overall
very
complex
and
very
drinkable
rating
it
straight
4s
is
because
the
qualifier
for
4
is
good
its
good
but
almost
to
the
point
of
being
average
d
well
im
certainly
intrigued
by
this
one
i
have
to
admit
that
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
sour
ales
and
this
skews
heavily
in
the
sour
direction
i
have
to
give
allagash
credit
though
as
ive
never
tasted
anything
like
this
very
unique
a
complex
beast
of
a
beer
immediate
hit
of
carbonation
followed
by
flavors
of
funky
fruit
cherry
apple
plum
bread
crust
oak
and
barnyard
no
ive
never
tasted
a
barnyard
but
seriously
it
has
this
lingering
flavor
of
how
a
barnyard
smells
minus
the
shit
a
dry
crisp
finish
with
lingering
tartness
overall
an
amazing
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
yet
i
was
a
little
disappointed
because
i
had
huge
expectations
based
on
my
love
of
the
other
allagash
oakaged
beers
and
the
price
19
compared
to
14
for
curieaux
it
pours
a
golden
ruddy
color
with
a
good
head
nice
lacing
and
a
continuous
stream
of
fine
bubbles
big
aroma
dominated
by
oak
and
belgiany
floral
notes
more
of
the
same
flavorwise
with
some
late
fruity
notes
cherry
peach
and
maybe
a
little
anise
a
pleasantly
bracing
sharpness
hits
the
back
of
the
palate
late
not
as
complex
as
expected
but
still
very
very
good
truly
i
do
heartily
recommend
this
but
i
enjoyed
the
curieaux
and
the
musette

an
august
2008
bottle
that
has
been
stored
properly
brett
really
really
coming
out
and
blending
with
what
i
call
blood
of
the
earth
scents
and
tastes
from
the
wine
barrels
really
morphed
into
a
very
wellbalanced
complex
beer
but
the
sour
has
gone
spicy
and
the
wood
has
really
come
out
itll
be
cool
to
see
where
these
bottles
go
after
a
few
more
years
cheers
d
this
is
pretty
complex
i
have
killed
the
bottle
over
the
course
of
about
4
hours
and
had
it
with
dinner
this
isnt
an
everyday
thing
for
me
i
dont
even
know
if
a
once
a
month
sort
of
thing
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
but
most
likely
when
i
buy
another
it
will
be
aging
for
a
while
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
pretty
nice
and
interesting
beer
to
sip
but
there
is
too
much
brett
yeast
flavors
for
my
tastes
i
think
this
is
probably
not
balanced
enough
for
me
and
i
know
the
price

is

allagash
typically
does
a
good
job
with
their
offerings
and
this
is
no
exception
a
very
nice
sipper
probably
a
good
company
beer
d
this
is
so
complex
its
hard
to
say
that
it
is
drinkable
as
others
have
said
i
think
there
is
a
bit
too
much
going
on
with
this
one
the
belgian
pale
aspect
of
it
has
some
amazing
flavors
that
get
a
little
undercut
by
the
brett
if
one
focuses
just
on
the
wild
ale
characteristics
of
this
brew
still
something
is
left
to
be
desired
with
balance
i
think
this
one
comes
close
but
falls
short
in
the
fact
that
it
is
just
trying
too
hard
to
be
too
many
things
i
like
complexity
but
sometimes
its
good
to
master
simple
things
then
throwing
a
bunch
of
different
fairly
good
aspects
together
while
i
am
pretty
hard
on
this
brew
it
was
excellent
and
i
commend
the
people
at
allagash
for
putting
it
together
with
some
minor
adjustments
it
could
be
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
russian
river
wild
ales
was
it
worth
20
id
say
probably
not
but
if
youve
got
the
itch
sometimes
you
just
have
to
scratch
it
i
might
buy
this
one
again
if
it
were
in
the
12
dollar
range
d
a
great
beer
by
allagash
but
at
the
price
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
except
for
once
or
twice
when
it
comes
out
each
year
still
it
is
a
beer
every
craft
fan
should
try
at
least
once
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
i
have
ever
had
for
sure
thanks
to
kenny
at
hollingsheads
for
having
the
last
stash
of
this
at
his
deli
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
else
in
the
southland
im
guessing
this
would
pair
well
with
a
blue
cheese
or
morbier
and
pears
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
mysterious
complexity
and
a
good
flavor
but
the
plastic
note
at
the
end
is
a
bit
odd
yet
interesting
d
ok
not
my
favorite
beer
scores
higher
in
ast
because
of
uniqueness
not
necessarily
because
i
really
dig
it
personal
thing
really
different
beer
though
and
i
am
glad
to
have
had
one
pours
slightly
darker
than
golden
yet
mostly
clear
with
a
reasonable
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
is
first
a
pungent
sourness
and
a
little
spice
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
rather
light
imo
the
flavor
is
a
tart
harvest
fruit
the
9
5
abv
seems
to
be
well
hidden
granted
im
not
hugely
experienced
with
these
but
i
have
sampled
a
handful
of
the
top
10
i
surrender
that
this
is
not
my
style
this
one
is
by
far
more
expensive
than
the
other
top
five
and
im
just
not
able
to
discern
that
much
difference
to
those
that
live
for
belgian
strong
pale
i
salute
you
overall
this
beer
is
good
i
love
sour
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
not
only
is
it
sour
but
it
is
different
with
it
being
very
saison
like
too
bad
it
is
not
cheep
quite
well
done
satisfying
in
small
amounts
a
bottle
to
be
shared
but
can
also
be
had
by
one
person
so
smooth
and
easy
going
it
is
thankx
to
franksnbeans
for
the

vintage
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
thick

that
lingers
impressive
for
the
higher
alcohol
content
smell
was
mostly
tropical
fruit
pineapples
mostly
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
outstanding
with
lots
of
flavor
pineapples
funkinessswild
yeast
characteristics
and
vanilla
and
butterscoth
flavors
the
flavors
blended
really
well
together
was
velvety
smooth
on
the
mouth
with
some
slight
sweetness
would
call
it
mediumbodied
it
was
very
drinkable
and
left
me
wanting
more
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
had
this
on
tap
at
toronado
in
san
francisco
poured
a
perectly
clear
amber
brown
with
little
head
but
fantastic
lacing
the
smell
was
somewhat
thin
with
a
slight
sourness
a
la
rodenbach
but
delicate
and
balanced
with
wood
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
amazing
taste
i
had
this
on
draft
and
it
really
seems
to
change
the
flavor
profile
a
good
bit
not
like
the
smell
at
all
the
sourness
was
way
downplayed
in
favor
of
a
fantastic
creaminess
like
a
beer
cream
soda
utterly
creamy
and
with
a
hint
of
sourness
developing
in
the
background
and
a
strong
note
of
hazlenut
on
the
finish
utterly
amazing
the
transition
from
sour
to
nutty
creaminess
is
magnificent
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
delicious
wow
such
a
fascinating

has
cellared
well
i
just
cracked
a

bottle
the
carbonation
was
initially
explosive
but
then
mellowed
out
the
beer
is
soft
and
lovely
with
a
healthy
sourness
and
remains
wonderfully
complex
and
drinkable

orangeamber
with
a
slight
chill

that
cleared
up
as
it
warmed
offwhite
foam
settled
quickly
to
a
thick
ring
with
a
skim
of
fine
bubbles
then
wouldnt
go
away
a
bit
of
chunky

with
some

a

filled
out
the
middle
medium
bodied
fairly
light
but
with
a
bit
of
stickyness
alcohol
warmth
was
a
little
rough
to
start
with
carbonation
remained
spritzy
throughout
and
it
had
a
grainy
malt
texture
it
really
opened
up
as
it
warmed
i
definitely
suggest
serving
at
cellar
temperature
or
above
quite
tasty
and
interesting
though
the
finish
was
a
little
aggressive
drinkability
hey
the
last
of
the
rip
off
allagash
series
turns
out
to
be
the
best
one
of
the
bunch
still
not
at
19
which
is
cheap
as
i
have
seen
it
for
as
much
as
26
12
would
be
a
good
asking
price
a
really
tasty
and
complex
beer
nevertheless
overall
a
serious
beer
to
contemplate
carefully
this
one
was
a
slow
drinker
for
me
i
was
excited
from
the
aroma
but
the
taste
didnt
seem
to
match
i
would
like
to
try
a
more
recent
version
to
compare
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
mix
of
pale
bret
yeast
and
oak
barrel
scents
its
tart
but
nothing
too
intense
the
oak
mellows
it
out
quite
a
bit
the
taste
is
exceptional
it
has
a
warm
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
sour
with
excellent
oak
notes
it
has
quite
a
complex
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
there
is
definately
a
lot
going
on
here
the
flavors
are
very
intense
and
blend
well
together
pours
a
two

a
good

drinkability
the
intense
complexity
makes
this
a
slowsipping
beer
though
its
entirely
enjoyable
its
a
beer
best
shared
with
someone
more
than
one
glass
might
be
a
bit
too
much
but
less
than
one
glass
leaves
you
wanting
more

experience

around
very

seems

this

i
split
the

with
a
friend
and
we
had
no
problem
drinking
it
all
though
i
could
feel
it
afterwards
i
hope
im
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
try
this
again

second
noseful
reveals
the
sour
bret
yeast
and
a
slight
peach
smell
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
that
i
can
detect
and
then
that
taste
a
big
sweet
belgian
golden
at
the
start
with
tart
apple
plus
earthy
skin
pear
and
a
cakey
middle
then
like
a
damn
whip
crack
the
sour
pops
up
dry
bitter
and
long
as
a
summer
day
the
tingly
carbonation
attacks
the
palate
and
underlines
the
pear
like
flavors
that
appeared
initially
only
as
the
beer
warms
do
the
oak
notes
appear
almost
a
honey
note
that
mixes
rather
surprisingly
with
the
tart
sour
finish
in
fact
interlude
isnt
finished
with
the
long
dry
end
the
sweetness
from
the
barrel
is
actually
the
last
note
i
get
this
is
unlike
anything
ive
tasted
before
body
is
on
the
fuller
side
of
light
i
would
prefer
it
a
bit
thicker
but
its
rescued
by
the
tap
dancing
of
the
carbonation
across
the
tongue
as
for
drinkability
its
delicious
and
unique
or
even
tasting
and
it
damn
sure
isnt
worth
the
price

o
this

a

hops
but
dont
want
to
destroy
your

for
the

i
will
definitely
drink
this
again

any

different
would
have
again
but
only
w
the
cuisine
mentioned
above
o
an
extremely
interesting
complex
and
enticing
beer
that
draws
me
back
for
another
long
evocative
and
transforming
sip
a
slightly
thinner
body
more
carbonation
and
a
slight
decrease
in
the
bitterness
might
have
really
put
this
one
over
the
top
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
overall
an
excellent
take
on
a
traditional
beer
without
resorting
to
west
coast
hops
for
a
nontraditional
spin
very
much
preferred
at
38
degrees
or
less
warm
it
didnt
taste
like
all
that
much
to
me
love
that
it
is
7
and
not
filling
overpriced
for
being
sold
in
a
4pack
very
grassy

saison
positive
for
sure
that
gets
slightly
bogged
down
in

still
an

has

something
was
just
off
easy
drinking
for

but
to
me
it
hit
everything
except
the
taste
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
perhaps
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
just
a
tad
dryer
but
that
is
only
a
quibble
o
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
different
you
think
the
belgian
yeast
is
going
to
be
huge
in
this
like
in
most
beers
but
it
hits
your
tongue
and
its
a
little
hoppy
lemony
and
then
bam
its
gone
in
a
wash
of
mild
clove
spiciness
this
beer
is
so
different
its
really
good
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
well
developed
somewhat
of
a
farmhouse
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
a
spicy
zest
and
slight
lemon
bready
taste
up
front
with
a
somewhat
spicy
hop
and
a
lemon
aftertaste
light
bodied
taste
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
had
a
lot
better
overall
i
like
this
beer
alot
i
bet
garrett
oliver
never
anticipated
making
a
beer
like
this
thank
goodness
for
brooklyn
gentrification
sorry
new
yorkers
you
deserve
it
and
you
can
handle
it
i
would
love
to
drink
this
fresh
in
brooklyn
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
lemonlime
flavors
the
yeast
is
fully
present
its
a
saison
with
more
lemon
lime
flavor
than
usual
had
at
pittsburgh
winter
beerfest
o
great
beer
a
very
unique
beer
could
drink
several
of
these
refreshing
glass
perfect
pint
o
a
nice
balanced
brew
which
includes
standard
farmhouse
tropes
grass
spice
funk
and
a
pleasant
lemony
hit
from
the
sorachi
ace
tasty
one
of
my
new
favorite
saisons

tried
at
a
beer
fest
and
had
to
buy
some
a
good
type
of
hop
to
try
first
and
very
disappointing
beer
ive
tried
from
brooklyn
tasted
very
little
citrus
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
watered
down
taste
of
a
bud
light
o
with
a
neutral
malt
character
this
beer
is
all
about
the
interplay
of
the
belgian
yeast
strain
and
the
unique
sorachi
ace
hops
the
hopping
itself
brings
enough
complexity
to
drive
the
beer
and
keep
the
drinker
interested
throughout
the
session
but
the
yeast
character
adds
much
too
it
really
gets
its
hooks
into
you
and
draws
you
in
with
each
sip
as
far
as
pairings
go
this
is
an
absolute
slam
dunk
with
sushi
o
this
is
a
very
well
done
saison
the
lemon
dominates
the
flavor
this
would
be
awesome
for
a
summer
day
from
the
second
i
poured
this
beer
i
didnt
really
like
it
too
yellow
not
enough
carbonation
smell
was
decent
but
nothing
i
wanted
to
linger
over
the
beer
did
improve
as
it
warmed
but
only
enough
to
allow
me
to
finish
drinking
the
bottle
too
bitter
almost
caustic
not
really
dry
aside
from
all
those
negatives
i
didnt
like
the
flavor
although
i
can
see
how
that
would
be
a
subjective
element
to
this
beer
maybe
something
went
haywire
with
the
first
bottling
for
12
oz
4packs
glad
i
only
bought
the
single
crisp
and
clean
with
a
huge
lemongrass
nose
overall
a
good
american
saison
but
not
as
much
of
the
farmhouse
flavors
that
make
the
style
so
special
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
the
carbonation
dies
down
o
a
good
beer
some
drawbacks
but
a
very
original
saison
o
a
different
take
on
the
saison
certainly
not
a
light
thirst
quencher
happy
to
have
tried
this
and
i
would
recommend
to
any
saison
lover
incredible
best
of
the
year
i
had
in
the
imortal
words
of
uncle
eddie
it
is
goood
will
certainly
seek
out
again
its
nice
to
see
this
beer
in
a
new
format
its
a
nice
beer
but
not
my
favorite
saison
its
still
something
everyone
should
try
if
they
havent
already
not
very
good
horrible
after
taste
i
dont
like
saisons
though
overallvery
refreshing
beer
something
id
love
to
drink
in
slightly
warmer
weather
great
representative
of
the
style
this
is
an
amazing
food
pairing
beer
great
lemon
citrus
notes
banana
flavor
from
the
belgian
yeast
champagne
mouth
feel
and
appearance
and
it
just
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
would
be
an
excellent
wine
replacement
for
a
special
restaurant
night
or
dinner
party
onice
range
of
subtle
flavors
but
the
lemon
dominates
the
show
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
drinkable
and
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
nice
representation
crisp
beer
that
featured
lemon
or
lemongrass
with
hints
of
coriander
small
bubbles
in
the
head
yielded
way
to
a
thin
film
of
foam
very
good
beer
that
i
will
revisit
will
seek
out
again
got
a
little
too
much
lemon
on
the
palette
nicely
carbonated
easy
finish
nice
mouthfeel
but
hard
not
to
think
someone
mixed
lemonade
with
beer
light
gold
pour
quick
dissipating
white
slight

lemon
grass

totally
interesting
taste
definitely
a
unique

great
champagne

try
it
youll
like
it
exceptionally
good
with
a
very

this
beer
is

and
should
not
be
missed

really
nice
saison
with
a
lemony
focus
first
experience
with
sorachi
ace
hops
very
interesting
beer
cant
say
ive
had
anything
like
it
while
holding
onto
a
lot
of
the
saison
character
it
differentiates
itself
with
some
pine
and
lemongrass
citrus
flavors
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
almost
dont
notice
the
7
6
abv
this
beer
put
me
off
balance
and
had
me
coming
back
for
more
750
ml
bottle
from
wed
12312014
niciu
3rd
annual
nye
party
gifted
from
someone
unknown
brewingpackaging
dates
poured
into
plastic
cup
drank
over
30
minutes
although
it
tastes
like
you
are
drinking
pine
needles
i
still
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
saison
this
is
a
good
looking
and
smelling
beer
but
what
caught
me
was
the
taste
it
just
tastes
fabulous
the
funk
and
a
touch
of
sour
are
really
a
fantastic
combo
and
make
this
beer
work
extraordinarily
well
i
hesitated
a
while
before
finally
buying
this
beer
i
was
saisoned
out
but
this
beer
renews
my
faith
in
a
classic
style
such
a
lovely
beer
really
brings
to
the
fore
what
this
hop
has
to
contribute
lovely
complex
lemony
herbal
floral
notes
and
a
very
clean
malt
profile
lend
it
a
nice
balance
and
a
pretty
ridiculous
drinkability
for
the
abv
this
wouldnt
be
a
goto
saison
for
me
but
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
masterful
combination
that
worked
really
well
would
definitely
look
forward
to
this
again
o
a
very
interesting
and
complex
farmhouse
ale
so
much
stuff
going
on
with
these
sorachi
ace
hops
i
love
this
beer
ive
had
it
a
few
times
on
tap
and
in
growlers
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
the
flavour
i
pick
up
other
than
a
hint
of
bubblegum
you
might
think
it
would
be
bad
but
this
beer
is
great
overall
a
great
saison
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
with
a
lemon
based
feel
and
a
great
lightness
a
great
beer
year
round
but
i
can
imagine
this
being
even
better
on
a
hot
summers
evening
enjoy
hint
of
tartness
but
great
beer
overall
cheese
is
done
apple
core
is
turning
brown
on
the
board
but
im
still
nursing
this
last
glass
because
i
dont
want
it
to
end
needs
the
chill
buy
pour
eat
drink
repeat
o
an
interesting
experiment
that
falls
short
imo
the
waxy
musty
and
dilllike
notes
detract
from
the
beer
and
muddle
what
is
supposed
to
be
a
very
clean
style
and
despite
the
stellar
mouthfeel
the
disparate
aromas
and
flavours
never
come
together
in
a
cohesive
way
i
can
see
what
theyre
trying
to
do
here
but
this
one
doesnt
do
much
for
me
overall
aromatic
and
flavorful
while
still
crisp
and
refreshing
especially
given
its
7
6
abv
poured
a
clear
straw
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
marshmallowsoft
white
head
aromas
of
the
belgian
yeast
spicy
and
a
hint
peppery
some
lemon
grass
lemon
celery
this
is
a
unique
hop
for
sure
delicious
farmstyle
with
really
unique
notes
combined
with
wellintentioned
balance
slightly
dry
finish
with
some
lingering
notes
of
the
lemongrass
this
is
a
winner
o
tasty
with
good
complexity
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
a
classic
saison
that
introduces
a
hybrid
touch
north
americanstyle
dryhopping
with
japanese
hops
very
nice
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
very
fizzy
head
almost
looks
like
a
champagne
the
smell
was
full
of
lemon
but
also
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
lemongrass
gives
out
earthy
tones
which
then
open
up
to
the
zest
and
hops
near
the
end
for
a
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
liked
it
a
lot
o
a
damn
good
beer
and
a
damn
good
saison
nice
balance
of
flavors
o
overall
this
was
a
great
rendition
of
the
saison
great
beer
from
brooklyn
overall
i
havent
dabbled
with
this
style
much
as
saisons
dont
usually
impress
me
but
this
was
just
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
satisfied
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
bit
subdued
than
what
i
prefer
but
its
clean
balanced
drinkable
and
ultimately
damn
tasty
this
is
a
summer
beer
for
the
record
books
recommended
dry
and
crisp
on
the
palate
finishing
with
a
solid
hop
bitterness
citric
hop
character
solid
malt
presence
and
just
a
bit
yeasty
carbonation
is
somewhat
aggressive
but
softer
than
a
sparkling
wine
while
this
is
no
session
beer
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
give
it
a
very
refreshing
character
with
only
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
brooklyns
big
bottle
belgians
local
12
are
great
beers
and
sorachi
ace
is
no
exception
very
very
dry
great
carbonation
tingles
the
young
mouthfeel
not
quite
as
nice
as
hennepin
very
original
taste
probably
from
the
sorachi
that
makes
this
stand
out
from
other
saisons
pretty
damn
good
overall
a
unique
and
interesting
saison
id
rank
it
just
behind
tank
7
and
hennepin
o
excellent
brew
less
is
more
as
far
as
flavor
alcohol
level
and
weightiness
this
is
more
because
of
its
light
feel
less
sweetness
dry
character
and
overall
light
herbal
quality

o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
buy
local
1
over
this
one
every
time
but
it
was
good
all
the
same
o
did
have
some
of
a
funky
taste
but
not
as
much
as
most
i
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
a
beer
ive
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
its
a
solid
saison
from
the
folks
at
brooklyn
nice
to
try
once
but
it
just
seems
like
for
a
farmhouse
ale
its
a
shadow
of
a
belgian
ale
i
guess
maybe
its
me
i
prefer
belgian
ale
to
farmhouse
ale
poured
from
corked
750
ml
bottle
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
overall
a
very
very
good
saison
with
a
good
twist
on
the
hop
presence
and
malt
flavor
profile
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
the
first
batch
poured
hazy
goldenrod
with
short
lived
white
head
aroma
is
awful
weird
lemongrass
and
lemon
bitters
type
of
aroma
earthy
grassy
and
more
grass
with
an
overcompensation
of
lemongrass
spritzy
carbonation
refreshing
if
you
can
palate
it
o
this
was
amazing
my
first
saison
and
it
has
opened
my
eyes
to
the
style
refreshing
amazing
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
had
it
to
celebrate
the
first
day
of
spring
but
this
would
be
great
in
the
heat
of
summer
im
going
to
seek
this
out
again
what
a
great
brew
that
i
almost
passed
up
on
if
you
like
the
saisonfarmhousebelgian
style
pick
it
up
overall
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
farmhouse
ales
ive
ever
had
personally
perfectly
balanced
perfectly
dryhopped
perfectly
succinct
a
wonderful
farmhouse
crisp
clean
sugary
complex
and
layered
the
sorachi
ace
also
makes
quite
a
statement
very
floral
funky
and
natural
tasting
almost
like
flowers
and
cannabis
with
rich
sugars
and
fresh
yeast
delicious
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
teetering
on
perfection
in
fact
i
do
not
know
what
could
be
improved
i
rate
this
even
higher
given
the
fun
experimentation
lemon
sets
the
tone
from
the
bright
yellow
color
to
the
nose
and
taste
some
bubblegum
and
white
pepper
there
is
a
sweet
and
spicy
feel
about
the
whole
experience
the
malt
is
subdued
but
present
with
a
more
yeast
tones
an
light
lemony
hops
really
like
this
maybe
not
love
it
but
worth
the
try
i
like
it
even
with
2
years
on
it
overall
a
good
beer
overall
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
perhaps
this
beer
is
better
fresh
but
it
isnt
knocking
me
out
of
the
park
prairie
standard
seems
like
a
better
representation
of
the
sessionable
hoppy
saison
style
ill
probably
stick
with
that
overall
i
like
some
of
the
tastes
but
the
combination
comes
off
unbalanced
and
grassy
had
this
before
and
gave
it
a
good
rating
so
i
wanted
to
do
a
full
review
to
see
where
it
fell
excellent
overall
beer
outstanding
look
for
a
saison
will
even
better
smell
and
a
very
interesting
and
satisfying
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
and
one
i
will
revisit
from
time
to
time
overall
really
nice
saison
the
sorachi
ace
hops
add
a
nice
twist
on
a
traditional
saison
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
sampled
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
light
yellow
to
amber
colored
brew
with
a
minimal
white
head
but
ample
carbonation
sparkly
and
with
a
champagnelike
mouthfeel
aroma
extremely
bright
fruity
and
vegetal
redolent
with
lemon
zest
green
herbs
yeastderived
spicy
notes
and
a
dry
nutty
earthiness
perhaps
a
tad
musty
palate
is
unique
a
combination
of
more
typical
earthy
spicy
flavors
characteristic
of
classic
saisons
and
assertive
herbalcitrus
hops
as
one
would
expect
from
a
beer
billed
as
a
singlehop
showcase
the
pilsener
malt
and
nutty
yeast
elements
are
present
but
take
a
back
seat
to
vibrant
cilantro
lemon
grass
and
spice
seed
flavors
that
make
for
a
memorable
and
perhaps
polarizing
taste
experience
there
is
also
a
root
cellar
earthy
peppery
spice
lurking
in
there
with
a
floral
perfume
and
some
alcohol
peeking
through
at
times
crisp
and
dry
body
is
just
shy
of
middling
and
the
lack
of
sweetness
becomes
more
apparent
as
one
proceeds
through
a
pint
approach
this
one
in
the
right
mindset
and
youll
be
intrigued
by
some
unusual
flavors
sorachi
ace
is
a
distinctive
hop
o
im
surprised
such
a
hopcentric
beer
was
still
so
great
after
almost
a
year
and
a
half
but
if
anyone
can
make
that
happen
its
brooklyn
definitely
a
musttry
and
hey
if
youre
looking
for
a
gift
beer
this
one
was
greatly
appreciated
merry
christmas
the
taste
is
parallels
what
i
get
on
the
nose
with
a
significant
lemon
zest
and
citrus
zing
flavor
mildly
toasted
malts
and
a
tart
yet
dry
finish
it
is
very
much
like
champagne
with
that
slight
maltiness
to
remind
me
it
is
a
beer
overall
a
very
nice
saison
with
a
twist
the
sorachi
ace
hop
lends
some
very
nice
citrus
notes
that
compliment
the
belgina
yeast
nicely
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
picking
up
o
this
is
a
good
saison
with
some
unique
flavors
that
i
assume
are
from
the
sorachi
ace
hops
i
find
it
just
a
bit
too
heavy
in
the
body
but
have
no
other
critiques
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
that
produced
a
huge
white
head
that
was
very
well
retained
and
faded
into
a
thin
cap
carbonation
was
streaming
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
gave
off
a
very
good
belgian
yeast
aroma
and
slight
citrus
lemon
maybe
the
taster
was
excellent
just
what
you
would
expect
but
with
a
dry
aftertaste
the
beer
follows
the
nose
perfectly
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
it
was
extremely
drinkable
and
smooth
overall
very
high
quality
obviously
i
need
to
try
a
couple
more
sorachi
hopped
beers
before
i
decide
if
they
are
worth
the
fuss
for
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
saison
but
not
a
great
one
with
the
rampant
availability
of
this
in
my
area
im
smacking
myself
in
the
head
for
not
having
tried
this
sooner
picked
up
a
bomber
at
the
local
stop
shop
it
definitely
needs
to
warm
a
bit
before
all
the
complexity
comes
out
first
glass
was
a
bit
too
cold
and
i
found
it
good
but
not
great
second
glass
i
let
sit
for
about
10
minutes
and
thats
when
this
beer
really
shined
very
pleasant
mild
funk
on
the
nose
with
grass
and
lemon
interwoven
poured
out
with
a
nice
head
that
held
on
till
i
drained
the
glass
kind
of
earthy
taste
again
with
the
grass
and
lemon
and
it
goes
down
quite
easily
a
very
good
beer
which
i
will
definitely
buy
again
and
can
find
virtually
anywhere
overall
sorachi
ace
seems
like
a
perfect
fit
for
a
saison
herbalwild
tones
of
the
hops
play
along
well
with
the
strong
yeast
saison
background
o
my
hat
is
off
to
the
discovery
of
sorachi
ace
hop
varietals
and
how
brooklyn
brewing
assembled
this
brew
this
is
fantastic
it
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
saisons
out
there
the
smell
is
lemon
citrus
with
a
hint
of
grass
these
is
a
slight
pleasant
funk
the
taste
reminds
me
of
being
in
a
field
on
a
summer
morning
there
is
a
light
sweetness
at
the
start
with
a
blast
of
lemon
from
the
hops
and
some
fruitiness
the
finish
is
clean
dry
and
refreshing
theres
a
hint
of
a
pepper
with
pleasant
alcohol
warmth
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
is
all
about
the
sorachi
ace
hops
it
showcases
them
deliciously
and
refreshingly
o
a
very
nicely
done
saison
simple
and
straightforward
nothing
tricky
just
good
clean
craftsmanship
using
german
tworow
pilsener
malt
sorachi
ace
hops
and
belgian
house
and
champagne
yeast
overall
it
is
a
great
summer
porch
drinker
but
more
of
a
sipper
in
the
sun
this
beer
evokes
images
of
still
life
paintings
french
meadows
rays
of
sunlight
it
drinks
easily
and
is
enlivening
and
vivid
a
terrific
beer
would
pair
easily
with
a
variety
of
cheeses
light
dishes
and
even
with
salads
has
a
body
and
a
palate
that
would
compliment
plenty
of
fresh
and
pungent
herbs
as
this
is
so
clean
with
only
a
very
simple
palate
mild
and
gentle
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
earth
and
slight
funk
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
minerallike
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
but
not
in
your
face
hop
presence
perfect
smelling
beer
very
dry
crisp
flavor
not
much
fruit
biscuit
and
grassy
flavor
not
very
bitter
not
big
enough
flavor
thick
white
foamy
head
solid
lacing
pretty
good
beer
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
you
want
to
drink
right
after
a
round
of
golf
or
mowing
your
lawn
great
summer
thirstquencher
look
at
that
big
fat
threefinger
snowball
white
head
like
a
real
champagne
of
beers
fresh
zesty
seasoned
smell
with
a
light
sweet
malty
spinal
column
rising
from
this
pretty
amber
brew
the
flavor
seems
to
match
the
scent
as
the
hops
indescribably
unique
citron
demonstration
steals
the
show
more
than
subtle
less
than
front
forward
brooklyn
brewery
does
it
again
for
me
at
least
the
only
visual
obstructing
the
view
through
this
clear
golden
cloudless
thirstquenching
indulgence
are
the
crystal
carbonation
bubbles
drifting
up
to
support
the
stable
fetching
white
head
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
beer
i
can
drink
this
all
day
i
better
put
some
of
this
in
the
vault
before
its
all
gone
i
feel
like
if
i
tried
to
make
something
that
nearly
resembles
this
beautiful
brew
that
i
would
certainly
fail
brooklyn
brewery
i
love
this
stuff
o
overall
great
beer
at
the
brewery
here
in
brooklyn
and
having
it
this
fresh
is
the
best
overall
quite
good
but
as
noted
above
there
is
something
that
doesnt
sit
right
for
me
wish
i
could
identify
it
but
there
is
something
about
the
hop
flavours
particularly
the
lemongrass
that
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
despite
loving
lemongrass
this
one
pours
a
hazy
deep
gold
with
two
fingers
of
tight
whitefrothy
head
that
settles
gradually
the
aroma
is
bright
and
refreshing
with
notes
of
lemon
zest
and
a
crisp
crackery
malt
backbone
notes
of
herbs
and
earth
lie
faint
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
dry
and
clean
with
a
crisp
lightbodied
mouthfeel
some
appropriate
astringency
hits
on
the
back
of
the
palate
with
each
swallow
sorachi
ace
is
a
uniquely
refreshing
example
of
a
style
im
still
learning
to
appreciate
o
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
feel
its
kind
of
average
in
the
realm
of
saisons
ive
had
better
but
ive
had
worse
i
would
still
drink
this
again
on
hot
summer
days
would
definitely
purchase
again
wish
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
to
this
o
a
very
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
not
varied
enough
in
the
flavor
department
with
no
real
yeast
presence
despite
the
style
would
be
a
great
accompaniment
for
fish
or
seafood
dished
for
sure
growler
on
tap
at
joe
canal
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
large
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
very
good
lacing
and
head
retention
aroma
is
of
ripe
fruit
pears
sweet
yeast
and
spice
fruit
essence
taste
same
as
aroma
with
some
mild
spice
hops
bitterness
a
medium
body
crisp
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
mild
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
combination
of
sweet
spice
ripe
fruit
pears
yeast
and
biscuit
malt
followed
by
mild
spice
bitterness
for
balance
a
very
good
tasty
refreshing
and
flavorful
brew
very
nice
overall
quite
a
great
mesh
of
styles
you
got
your
world
class
saison
with
the
bitterness
of
sorachi
ace
hops
delivered
what
was
promised
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
both
on
tap
and
from
a
bomber
and
this
growler
again
proved
that
this
is
a
winner
a
great
creation
and
experiment
that
showcases
the
art
of
craft
brewing
a
high
recommendation
go
drink
this
if
you
want
a
deviation
from
the
norm
o
4
0
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
to
it
but
even
being
near
1
dimensional
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
the
forefront
aroma
and
flavor
of
the
pine
characteristics
linger
for
quite
some
time
after
finishing
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
the
champagne
yeast
definitely
makes
this
saison
unique
as
well
as
the
fact
that
its
a
singlehop
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
7
6
great
summer
brew
but
it
would
work
any
time
really
good
value
and
worth
picking
up
excellent
beer
very
flavorful
original
pleasant
to
drink
with
drinkability
at
its
best
overall
really
enjoyable
well
done
and
consistent
with
my
experiences
with
this
brewery
overall
this
beer
is
a
keeper
really
nice
clean
summer
belgian
i
will
buy
again
love
the
slightly
hoppy
clean
taste
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
creamy
white
head
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
and
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
lemon
and
grass
hence
lemongrass
and
spicy
black
pepper
notes
there
is
even
a
hint
of
orange
the
taste
is
very
yeasty
and
spicy
with
lemon
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedum
with
a
dry
finish
and
highly
effervescent
overall
im
glad
i
finally
tried
it
and
would
definitely
drink
more
sorachi
ace
hops
have
a
very
unique
aroma
o
perfectly
balanced
sorachi
ace
starts
with
a
great
hop
presence
of
lemon
and
pepper
that
carries
into
the
taste
it
has
a
nice
malt
character
sweet
and
buscuity
and
dries
out
for
a
clean
finish
they
appear
to
have
kept
the
recipe
simple
here
and
those
that
follow
that
blueprint
are
often
the
best
beers
no
this
was
my
introduction
to
sorachi
ace
hops
a
few
years
back
and
i
savor
that
flavor
in
any
beer
ive
had
containing
them
since
so
distinctive
would
match
so
well
with
a
light
fruity
dessert
or
peppery
salad
really
stellar
job
on
this
one
good
bitter
hop
finish
this
has
more
a
bit
complexity
to
me
than
dupont
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
but
also
complex
saison
overall
classic
style
saison
with
plenty
of
flavour
i
enjoyed
it
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
no
significant
lacing
this
ace
has
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
slight
pink
hue
smells
like
belgian
yeast
and
lemon
earthy
grassy
taste
i
can
taste
the
yeast
it
has
a
sour
tang
to
it
peach
aftertaste
strong
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
mellows
down
as
it
warms
and
settles
good
brew
i
think
i
preferred
the
ace
ontap
from
the
bottle
b
ontap
a
a
very
solid
beer
just
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
smell
beautiful
color
nice
and
golden
not
served
too
cold
which
i
think
is
important
very
good
taste
and
aftertaste
left
my
mouth
tasting
just
a
little
dry
this
beer
just
kept
getting
better
with
every
drink
i
would
order
this
ale
again
anytime
overall
really
good
stuff
had
this
with
a
nice
bbq
in
the
sun
and
it
was
perfect
i
will
buy
more
of
this
beer
even
with
the
slightly
higher
price
tag
likewise
for
the
alcohol
this
was
fairly
strong
but
in
no
way
did
the
booze
make
itself
felt
until
afterwards
while
the
earthiness
of
a
beer
typical
of
this
style
is
present
the
champagne
yeast
and
mountain
of
bubbles
gives
this
a
very
lively
feel
thats
present
from
start
to
finish
ive
never
had
a
bad
bomber
from
brooklyn
and
this
was
no
exception
this
was
wonderful
and
a
great
beer
to
welcome
in
the
warmer
days
with
carbonation
is
very
high
but
it
works
well
o
as
expected
for
a
saison
lots
of
fruit
and
florals
very
sweet
the
sugary
sweet
citrus
hits
first
but
the
pine
mint
grassy
flavor
hits
almost
immediately
after
and
the
two
mix
for
a
very
nice
flavor
definitely
stronger
on
the
mint
pine
grassy
side
b
this
is
fairly
malty
at
first
not
really
bitter
even
after
the
hop
flavors
emerge
but
rather
tart
in
the
vein
of
many
saisons
the
aftertaste
touches
on
more
bitterness
a
thoroughly
interesting
brew
im
glad
to
have
encountered
on
tap
at
pizza
paradiso
in
georgetown

visit
o
very
refreshing
summer
beer
i
can
see
myself
sitting
on
my
deck
drinking
this
for
hours
love
it
this
is
an
unusual
beer
and
in
a
good
way
hard
to
pinpoint
any
one
thing
about
it
but
the
overall
package
works
very
well
nice
and
complex
and
goes
down
easy
i
would
happily
have
this
one
again
highly
recommended
drinkability
quite
high
id
characterize
it
as
sessionable
but
the
abv
is
just
a
tad
high
for
that
still
this
is
going
to
become
a
part
of
my
regular
rotation
just
exceptional
very
good
suggestion
from
ron
dangerously
drinkable
fresh
crisp
dry
simple
and
executed
very
well
nice
integration
of
flavor
from
this
unique
hop
this
beer
went
down
pretty
quickly
this
is
a
great
saison
nice
earthy
tones
grassy
and
only
mildly
funky
carbonation
is
pretty
high
could
deal
with
a
little
less
of
that
but
this
is
consistent
and
on
the
spot
for
the
style
more
of
a
sipper
than
anything
else
another
nice
one
from
brooklyn
keep
it
up
folks
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
like
the
bottle
says
it
tastes
like
sunshine
in
a
glass
the
sorachi
ace
hops
gave
it
a
pilsner
quality
that
i
enjoyed
its
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
great
introductory
saison
for
white
wine
and
champagne
drinkers
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
great
job
brooklyn
best
use
of
sorachi
ace
hops
ive
come
across
nice
showcase
for
it
and
it
doesnt
totally
take
over
in
the
taste
with
the
belgian
yeast
enough
to
work
with
it
lovely
beer
and
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
750ml
serving
size
is
also
about
right
enough
to
drink
on
your
own
but
still
a
decent
size
to
share
o
this
hop
varietal
seems
to
pair
perfectly
with
the
saison
style
accentuates
the
standard
lemongrasshay
flavors
of
saisons
well
done
id
like
to
compare
it
to
the
bottle
version
sorachi
ace
is
really
something
special
if
you
read
the
back
label
too
intently
you
might
never
open
it
the
ingredients
are
well
thought
out
and
effective
drinking
it
right
now
in
february
it
reminds
me
of
warm
summer
days
and
crisp
dry
satisfaction
the
head
is
white
and
crisp
the
aroma
a
bouquet
and
the
taste
exquisite
i
want
more
o
a
very
nice
saison
good
flavors
and
complexity
without
anything
outshining
another
flavor
o
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
just
wish
they
carried
it
locally
nearest
place
to
get
it
retail
is
about
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
house
oive
rated
this
beer
quite
highly
because
it
highlights
the
wonderful
sorachi
hops
so
perfectly
its
a
hop
forward
beer
that
is
extremely
refreshing
i
dont
think
ill
find
anything
quite
like
it
and
will
certainly
seek
this
out
again
overall
the
weird
aftertaste
is
the
only
thing
that
detracts
from
this
beer
otherwise
it
is
outstanding
this
may
become
my
goto
saison
when
i
want
something
light
and
complex
overall
i
dont
normally
go
for
hopdriven
beers
but
this
is
excellent
definitely
demonstrates
the
broad
range
of
flavors
in
beer
i
wish
the
flavors
were
a
bit
smoother
and
more
connected
perhaps
in
a
rye
version
but
the
hops
and
yeast
melded
well
into
a
delicious
harmony
very
tasty
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
not
really
into
overwhelming
bitterness
but
want
to
try
a
pure
expression
of
a
hop
varietal
overall
i
like
this
as
something
different
and
refreshing
it
doesnt
wow
me
but
it
definitely
has
a
right
ace
and
right
time
for
it
o
a
really
interesting
saison
variation
with
a
nice
distinctive
hop
character
from
the
sorachi
varietal
tasty
and
subtle
overall
this
was
a
good
representation
of
the
saison
style
i
think
there
was
too
much
lemon
zest
over
powering
the
other
flavors
for
my
taste
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
i
wont
rush
out
to
buy
another
immediately
mouthfeel
full
slightly
dry
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
nice
i
hope
to
get
one
for
the
summer
time
as
i
can
see
me
drinking
this
on
the
deck
on
a
warm
day
i
like
this
and
will
definitely
buy
another
bottle
in
may
or
june
for
the
summer
brooklyn
has
a
winner
and
i
know
why
they
decided
to
bottle
this
one
and
distribute
it
this
is
really
pleasant
to
drink
its
clean
refreshing
and
light
but
never
boring
i
dig
it
first
beer
of
evening
i
have
a
whole
big
beautiful
bottle
to
myself
stamp

pours
a
beautiful
hazy
wheat
gold
with
continuous
small
white
head
a
few
dark
floating
particulates
at
the
bottom
add
intrigue
aroma
of
lovely
fields
of
grain
and
bread
taste
of
a
good
saison
not
too
spicy
or
citrusy
but
components
of
lemon
orange
zest
black
pepper
grains
of
paradise
chives
lemongrass
sourdough
bread
modest
hops
slight
finish
of
funk
overall
very
tasty
ans
satisfying
overall
a
very
nice
drinking
and
flavorful
brew
i
would
definitely
recommend
as
it
was
a
nice
blend
of
funky
smooth
citrus
and
sweet
one
to
give
a
go
to
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
a
delicious
saison
i
love
this
style
and
i
love
this
beer
a
great
showcase
of
the
sorachi
ace
hop
for
any
of
you
homebrewers
out
there
this
is
a
pretty
decent
saison
some
unique

with

you
dont
get
to
see
often
glad
to
have
had
it
im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
best
way
to
showcase
a
hop
and
the
scaled
back
saison
isnt
going
to
blow
anyones
mind
still
a
nice
drinker
with
a
bit
of
something
different
overall
i
want
to
like
this
beer
more
than
i
actually
do
i
love
saisonstyle
ales
and
unique
hops
but
the
hops
dominate
this
one
a
bit
too
much
covering
up
the
saison
yeast
character
the
harsh
finish
drops
the
drinkability
a
bit
lives
up
to
the
special
hops
hype
poured
a
2
white
head
with
long
life
the
body
is
a
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
color
the
smell
is
different
including
the
lemon
zest
but
also
spiciness
malt
even
soap
taste
mirrors
the
smell
especially
the
lemon
zest
and
also
has
caramel
and
a
touch
of
sour
medium
rich
body
finish
is
a
little
soapy
interesting
and
refreshing
o
excellent
excellent
saison
havent
had
another
quite
like
it
m
medium
body
with
medium
alcohol
overall
an
interesting
tasty
and
refreshing
saison
i
will
definitely
try
to
have
this
again
o
very
good
beer
and
unlike
any
other
saison
i
have
had
the
sorachi
ace
hop
seems
to
be
bittering
and
lemony
in
my
experience
here
need
to
seek
out
other
beers
that
feature
it
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
it
certainly
fits
the
broad
style
nice
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
serving
type
growler
now
the
strong
points
of
this
beer
thees
a
brilliant
mouthfeel
awesomely
soft
and
fluffy
the
carbonation
is
high
but
very
refined
and
pleasant
the
alleged
star
of
this
saisonthe
sorachi
ace
hop
varietal
from
japan
is
present
though
seems
to
be
more
than
balanced
by
the
malt
the
hop
flavor
is
nice
lightly
lemony
and
herbal
bitter
but
not
totally
dry
and
the
notsostrong
i
must
admit
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brew
there
is
a
big
biscuity
malt
presence
that
i
wouldnt
say
is
par
for
the
saison
style
but
the
main
flaw
i
see
in
this
beer
is
an
annoyingly
buttery
flavor
dare
i
say
diacetyl
aftertaste
this
doesnt
fit
into
my
definition
of
crackingly
dry

the

and

this

my
first
try
of
the

and
quite

i
enjoyed
it
quite
a

in

the
lemon
builds
up
great

though
high

if
you
can

i
like
it
but

and
a
big
bottle
limit
it
for
me
if
in
12oz
format
and
some
lemon
peel
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
the
bright
its
light
and
refreshing
with
some
good
hoppy
flavors
the
beer
really
shows
off
the
sorachi
ace
hops
very
nicely
but
also
integrates
them
very
well
into
the
beer
i
didnt
find
it

it

in

this
one
is
on
the
verge
of
being
over
the
top
with
carbonation
upfront
there
is
a
spicey
flavor
that
is
mildly
peppery
but
turns
to
a
slight
hop
bitterness
heavily
flavored
with
grass
and
lemon
zest
very
mild
malt
backing
to
this
brew
but
at
times
it
does
come
across
a
bit
spicey
and
mildly
sweet
maybe
a
bit
like
pear
but
for
the
most
part
it
finishes
quite
dry
the
lingering
flavor
of
this
brew
is
all
lemon
and
grass
i
have
had
other
samples
of
beer
that
had
hints
of
lemongrass
but
this
one
really
brings
it

is

drinkability
a
nice
hoppy
and
bitter
saison
certainly
different
from
others
i
have
had
in
the
style
taste
wise
a
kind
of
a
mix
between
blue
moon
a
hoppy
pils
and
a
saison
a
nice
summery
beer
i
could
have
a
couple
glasses
of
d
goes
down
nice
but
i
cant
have
more
than
one
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
lemon
with
some
wheat
and
belgian
yeast
the
flavor
is
lemons
with
some
oranges
i
also
get
some
wheat
yeast
and
grassy
hops
low
to
medium
bitterness
very
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
saison
i
think
this
beer
is
very
crisp
and
dry
and
very
refreshing
drinkable
as
a
novelty
but
certainly
not
something
you
want
a
few
glasses
of
this
is
a
very
interesting
hop
which
needs
the
right
combination
of
ingredients
to
be
palatable
but
i
dont
think
this
is
it
the
unusual
hop
flavor
is
the
highlight
of
the
beer
balanced
with
malt
while
allowing
the
hops
to
be
the
primary
taste
longlasting
and
exceptional
aftertaste
with
a
lot
of
taste
between

of

beer
overall
brooklyn
brewery
has
some
quality
beers
and
some
outstanding
beers
this
beer
falls
under
the
quality
section
nice
and

and
easy
to
drink
with
a
crisp

the
11

for

a

much
especially
since

that
are

cheers
this
beer
was
eating
raw
lemongrass
very
potent
and
flavorful
missing
those
traditional
saison
elements
such
as
yeastiness
but
i
really
think
this
beer
was
constructed
to
show
off
the
hops
if
you
like
lemon
youll
love
this
beer
notes
first
encounter
with
the
sorachi
hops
i
think
although
this
particular
sense
of
flavor
is
something
that
i
feel
i
have
encountered
before
but
i
can
not
put
the
finger
to
it
great
craft
from
brooklyn
in
any
case
outstanding
saison
that
i
would
love
to
see
coming
back
at
least
as
a
yearly
seasonal
offering
d
an
ok
saison
nice
fruit
and
citrus
taste
would
give
another
shot
d
one
or
two
bombers
with
a
friend
or
two
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
nice
honestly
i
was
a
little
disappointed
its
not
that
it
isnt
great
because
it
is
it
has
an
almost
buttery
smoothness
to
compliment
the
citrus
hops
and
spicy
yeast
but
with
all
the
preamble
i
was
really
looking
for
something
that
could
break
into
my
alltime
top
5
its
not
quite
there
yet
but
brooklyn
clearly
has
a
winner
on
their
hands
its
more
easily
drinkable
than
i
expect
from
a
beer
in
its
class
and
it
has
a
knockout
combination
of
ingredients
that
make
for
a
fresh
and
unique
yet
classic
taste
aces
indeed
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
for
those
that
enjoy
some
carbonation
to
mix
it
up
once
in
a
while
drinkability
pretty
nicely
balanced
crisp
and
clear
a
little
funky
for
a
bit
too
long
but
it
comes
back
into
harmony
i
like
it
well
worth
the
price
i
would
much
prefer
to
have
it
on
tap
as
im
curious
as
to
how
the
flavors
will
taste
fresh
regardless
if
you
enjoy
brooklyns
offerings
this
is
another
cantmiss
out
of
a
750ml
corked

bottle

a
slightly
hazy
honey
straw
color
with
a
huge
pure
white
head
that
slowly
settles
leaving
some
thick
lacing

a

is
sweet

spicy
light
pale
malt
candi
sugar
white
pepper
clove
and
wild

good
phenolic
aromas
from

the
taste
is
of
the
candi
sugar
clove
coriander
and
pepper
then
comes
the
unique
hop
flavor
a
sugar
laced
lemon
flavor
comes
through
imparting
a
dry
and
slightly
tart
note
it
has
some
grassyhay
like
flavors
as
well
the
yeasty
flavors
dont
come
out
as
strong
as
it
did
in
the
aroma
the
feel
is
light

extremely
fizzy
sweet
yet
dry
finishes
balanced
not
a
traditional
saison
i
find
that
a
lot
of
the
funk
tart
flavors
comes
from
the
hops
the
beer
has
a
good
belgian
base
but
the
hops
make
it
grassy
and
in
the
case
of
many
brewers
but
this
will
be
my
first
time
from
the
bottle
the
color
is
golden
straw
as
well
as
some
dry
grain
the
flavor
starts
out
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
worked
well
very
drinkable

this
comes
in

it

nothing
but
praise
for
this
beer
i
might
even
be
underrating
it
but
id
like
to
have
it
again
before
giving
it
even
higher
marks

beer
highly

does
the

say

then
require

as

sort
of
a
bigger
version
of
dupont
with
a
large
portion
of
banana
esters
and
cloves
certainly
another
aboveaverage
beer
from
dupont
and
reminds
me
how
they
just
own
saisons
taste
reveals
an
unbelievable
smooth
mouthfeel
due
to
a
huge
amount
of
belgian
yeast
which
puts
a
pillow
on
the
palate
on
top
of
that
warm
stingy
spices
amongst
black
pepper
build
up
a
fascinating
complexity
which
results
in
a
medium
dry
finish
with
subtle
vanilla
notes
very
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
present
at
no
point
at
all
very
intriguing
well
balanced
beer
bretts
among
metallic
lively
carbonation
are
responsible
for
a
supporting
sour
and
dryness
which
underlines
the
slick
spicy
yeast
impression
just
perfect
as
i
am
drinking
a

bottle
bretts
are
recognizable
only
for
a

mingled
together
with
copper
flavor
when
those

dough
malts

afternoon
goldenyellow
color
pretty
much
clear
with
a
small
white
head
on
top
that
displayed
good
retention
and
lacing
in
the
aroma
lots
of
dry
herbs
and
some
barnyard
funk
lots
of
spice
in
the
taste
coriander
rosemary
oregano
earthy
funk
stale
grains
manure
solventy
booze
just
wasnt
digging
it
pretty
much
like
any
other
dupont
saison
ive
had
with
an
upped
spice
profile
medium
body
mostly
dry
mouthfeel
but
overall
uncomfortable
and
really
hard
to
drink
i
like
saisons
a
lot
but
this
one
was
not
good
o
an
amazing
classic
that
i
can
see
has
set
a
standard
for
high
octane
saisons
much
prefer
it
to
the
others
ive
tried
drank
at
turkey
creek
with
my
father
in
law
june
29
2014
o
wow
take
the
initial
skunk
aroma
away
and
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
will
seek
this
out
again
in
the
hops
of
a
fresher
bottle
love
the
style
bottled
in
2008
and
this
beer
held
up
extremely
well
a
bit
of
sediment
and
opened
with
a
huge
pop
but
decanted
clear
great
taste
full
amazing
amount
of
brett
noticeable
some
heat
but
very
well
attenuated
its
an
experience
to
drink
the
beer
at
the
brewery
with
the
toilets
in
the
back
by
the
cows
but
you
can
always
find
perfect
examples
of
the
beer
in
bottles
too
overall
really
superb
complex
and
very
drinkable
overall
an
interesting
high
abv
saison
with
a
good
mix
of
flavours
the
vanillacoconut
type
flavour
gets
a
little
tired
with
a
750ml
format
but
still
a
very
solid
brew
well
worth
trying
and
perfect
for
sharing
fabulous
example
of
a
big
saison
refreshingly
sour
funkier
hoppier
than
average
and
tasty
saison
highly
recommended
for
who
likes
the
style
or
wants
to
adventure
overall
this
a
great
saison
nothing
bash
just
a
finely
tweaked
belgian
iteration
getting
back
to
the
roots
with
this
one
o
well
balanced
saison
the
carbonation
was
a
little
high
but
a
very
tasty
farmhouse
ale
a
clear
brilliant
bronze
yellow
color
with
virtually
no
head
or
lacing
and
few
signs
of
life
short
of
a
few
bubbles
here
and
there
pretty
but
looking
a
little
limp
the
aroma
brings
out
a
satisfying
apple
grain
blend
and
hints
of
alluring
spice
clove
and
allspice
promising
the
palate
quickly
enjoys
a
sturdy
apple
clove
hop
with
sweet
cereal
grain
with
a
tasteful
yeast
idea
to
balance
it
off
it
does
have
a
lazy
carbonation
to
it
which
opens
up
into
a
fuzzy
feel
that
more
than
adequately
delivers
this
tasty
holiday
treat
in
good
order
body
is
medium
full
and
it
sticks
to
your
ribs
just
a
bit
for
a
saison
style
but
the
relatively
high
abv
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
a
wonderful
treat
poured
from
a
375

bottle
pours
a
hazy

yellow

nose
is
filled
with
tons
of

notes

with

notes
spicy
pepper
and
a

bitter

bottleconditioned
and
very
aggressively
carbonated
just
amazing
and
again
this
is
coming
from
someone
whos
not
a
huge
saison
fan
to
begin
with
my
scores
reflect
my
sense
that
the
style
itself
is
rather
limited
if
on
the
other
hand
you
like
saisons
boost
the
score
upward
accordingly
o
enjoyable
balanced
a
solid
saison
slightly
more
bitter

decently

a

update
on
tap
at
chapter
one
in
santa
ana
this
tap
version
is
totally
anemic
in
carbonation
which
makes
it
taste
like
some
kind
of
sweet
and
scratchy
southern
fruit
wine
makes
me
think
of
corn
sourish
pear
skins
and
a
hint
of
quarante
y
tres
vanilla
liqueur
id
rank
it
lower
than
the
bottle
version
i
reviewed
high
b
d
an
amazing
strong
saison
with
more
overall
character
than
the
weaker
versions
ive
had
from
dupont
vielle
avril
although
naturally
the
strength
begets
less
drinkability
an
incredible
beer
and
well
worth
the
11
price
tag
flavors
of
floral
hops
candy
sugar
coriander
grassy
hops
light
pepper
and
herbs
some
astringency
while
this
bottle
is
im
guessing
a
tad
past
prime
its
nonetheless
very
tasty
and
my
numerous
experiences
with
this
beer
fresh
and
aged
have
always
been
positive
very
flavorful
full
bodied
complex
and
satisfying
no
elaborate
review
this
time
as
i
already
had
some
beers
and
i
was
with
friends
but
i
will
certainly
but
it
and
replace
this
temporal
review
wonderful
saison
certain
to
please
those
who
like
spice
forward
and
lightly
funky
certain
to
disappoint
those
looking
for
the
crazy
funk
or
the
extreme
tart
characters
of
some
saison
yeasts
i
know
a
number
of
beer
geeks
around
san
diego
that
put
this
into
their
top5
brews
it
deserves
any
hype
it
receives
in
the
40some
years
since
this
has
been
produced
it
tastes
like
the
brewers
have
taken
the
potentially
disparate
flavors
of
a
saison
and
arranged
them
perfectly
making
this
as
quaffable
as
they
come
this
is
one
of
the
best
looking
brews
you
will
have
it
doesnt
quite
hit
on
the
taste
though
but
it
is
very
good
drinkability
pretty
good
stuff
though
the
taste
disappoints
i
think
i
would
much
rather
drink
this
during
the
summer
than
the
holiday
season
though
o
one
of
my
favorite
holdiay
beers
and
one
of
the
best

ales
one
everyone
should
try
draught
monks
this
one
pours
a
hazy
orangish
color
there
was
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
very
nice
many
varied
fruits
coming
through
but
no
real
sweetness
actually
a
hint
of
sourness
to
the
fruits
the
taste
is
very
good
some
dryness
and
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
sourness
also
subtle
fruits
hints
of
spices
exceptionally
smooth
very
nice
ive
had
to
adjust
the

my

got
the
rest
into
my

i
got
all
the
yeast
not

if
that
is
a
good
or
bad
thing
it
has
the
horsey
belgian
smell
with
some
granny

apples
thrown
in
for
good

the
taste
is
great
pepper
and
apples
and
doughy
yeast
goodness
the
after
taste
has
a
light

thing
going

that
works

i
would
drink
this
everyday
if
i
werent
buzzing
so
hard
now
overall
quite
a
nice

just
exquisitely
crafted
and
extremely
delicate
for
its
heft
im
really
glad
i
found
this
one
drinkability
all
around
an

work

are

hit
but
they
are

from
the
yeasties
really
comes
through
as
well
there
is
a
slight
tartness
that
stays
on
the
tongue
on
the
finish
i
really
like
it
very
clean
and
refreshing
crisp
as

there
is
also
a

quality
here
as

no

that
has

is

has

the
drinkability
is
really
good

such
high
alcohol
its
very

you
drink
it
i
had
this
on

at
the
hop
leaf
and
was
quite
blown
away
with
it
when
i
came
across
it
in

the

there
was
only
2

which
me
and

grabbed

notes
of

a
light
sweetness
some
peppery
hops
in
the
mix
as
are
a
few
other
spices
notes
of
yeast
and
a
slight
funk
are
also
present
flavor
also
has
a
big
fruit
component
with
a
variety
of
lighter
fruits
mingling
with
the
grassy
hops
and
black
pepper
a
bit
biscuity
good
yeast
flavors
and
a
touch
of
the
old
funk
really
bring
this
together
nicely
where
is
the
alcohol
fairly
full
mouthfeel
with
a
very
crisp
feel
bubbly
on
the
tongue
and
quite
refreshing
great
drinkability
as
well
i
could
drink
this
all
day
or
until
that
sneaky
10
shows
itself
fantastic
brew
big
ass
saison
or
belgian
pale
ale
must
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
and
come
across
this
so
they
say
this
is
10
5
wow
the
candy
sugars
in
addition
to
malt
make
this
beer
a
big
one
color
is
gorgeous
cloudy
with
golden
color
and
truly
brilliant
smell
is
subtle
but
reminds
me
of
american
lager
alomst
with
slight
hops
taste
is
pleasant
and
mild
despite
high
alcohol
and
very
much
straight
and
to
the
point
low
carbonation
but
full
mouthfeel
that
dissipates
to
subtle
aftertaste
could
drink
this
beer
for
a
very
long
time
until
asleep
extraordinarily
drinkable
until
i
fall
on
the
floor
from
too
many
a
seasonal
beer
with
good
wishes
intended
supposedly
according
to
the
owner
of
the
distribution
company
this
one
clocks
in
at
10
5
its
only
slightly
apparent
mostly
dictated
by
the
slight
aroma
and
detection
of
candy
sugar
very
little
nose
detectable
actually
gave
me
a
lagerlike
aroma
this
may
have
been
a
result
of
the
draft
version
neglecting
the
bottle
condition
it
was
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
rather
brilliant
actually
the
higher
alcohol
does
not
come
through
in
the
taste
it
is
straight
and
to
the
point
pleasant
and
massive
in
its
delivery
mechanism
end
of
the
year
cheer
the
low
carbonation
compliments
the
full
and
dissipating
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
beer
until
i
fall
off
my
rocker
the
beer
disembarks
the
750ml
cork
and
caged
green
bottle
a
shining
gold
with
a
prodigious
creamy
bright
white
head
that
lingers
for
quite
sometime
and
the
lace
forms
a
thick
and
clinging
blanket
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
tangy
spiciness
over
ripe
fruit
seemed
to
be
a
mix
of
bananas
and
pineapples
crisp
and
clean
hints
of
clove
also
noticed
maybe
even
a
bit
of
fusel
alcohol
a
complex
one
at
any
rate
start
is
sweet
and
the
grain
profile
noticeable
the
top
is
light
to
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
caustic
hops
are
pleasantly
spicy
vinous
devastatingly
dry
and
the
aftertaste
welds
itself
to
your
palate
and
the
9
5
percent
abv
warmed
my
tummy
noticeably
a
great
beer
for
a
sunday
afternoon
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
2
eggshell
head
over
the
effervescent
golden
brew
head
keeps
growing
and
growing
due
to
rejuvenation
from
all
the
bubbles
finally
settles
down
with
about
an
inch
of
marshmallowy
foam
with
stunning
lace
coating
the
glass
the
lace
actually
looks
like
real
lace
with
alternating
patterns
of
the
foamy
remnants
aroma
is
lightly
spicy
with
sweet
maltiness
taste
is
wow
creamy
sweetness
followed
by
shots
of
spicing
with
a
crisp
dry
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
excellent
a
great
saison
even
better
than
i
was
expecting
bottle
poured
a
hay
blonde
looking
beer
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
with
great
retention
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
floral
yeast
with
some
good
strong
malt
also
present
yeast
is
very
noticeable
as
you
start
sipping
this
beer
and
malt
mix
with
spices
also
become
more
apparent
as
you
drink
funky
aspect
is
quite
present
thought
not
as
much
as
the
veille
saison
dupont
still
very
enjoyable
and
alcohol
is
not
detectable
what
magic
has
touched
this
liquid
to
make
it
so
near
perfect
is
this
proof
that
the
artisans
hand
is
more
powerful
than
the
chemists
figuring
the
devotion
to
time
and
place
more
potent
than
industrial
consistency
a
great
gift
from
dupont
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
taste
good
acidity
and
lively
carbonation
yeasty
and
bready
with
some
undisclosed
spicy
cereal
taste
very
satisfying
somewhat
loose
claritin
head
with
some
big
bubbles
on
edges
that
stick
and
jab
with
each
other
hazy
yellow
hue
that
looses
you
in
its
swirling
kind
of
balky
hop
presence
on
nose
with
a
candied
lemon
skin
gargle
very
pleasant
sweet
spring
grass
on
mouth
with
just
the
smallest
hint
of
tart
yeast
that
just
echoes
and
reminds
me
of
childhood
summer
days
and
promises
of
future
adventures
husky
wheat
permeates
the
mouthfeel
but
not
overtly
balanced
very
good
this
was
on
tap
to
day
at
red
bones
the
color
was
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
has
candy
notes
along
with
a
combination
of
citrus
and
pear
a
white
sheet
of
lace
was
prevalent
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
taste
has
a
nice
tartness
more
of
the
pear
and
citrus
a
lot
more
candy
sweetness
this
to
me
was
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
trippel
it
had
good
characters
of
both
a
mild
alcohol
warming
and
hop
bite
slick
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
all
in
all
it
was
quite
terrific
but
the
20
oz
may
have
been
a
tad
too
much
as
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
finish
it
it
went
well
with
the
rosemary
chocolate
we
had
as
well
a
worldclass
brew
sampled
from
a
750
though
the
lable
was
different
than
the
one
pictured
above
a
hazy
golden
amber
colored
brew
topped
by
a
dollop
of
magnificent
pure
white
head
that
laces
beautifully
intriguing
aromas
of
fresh
cut
grass
musty
hay
and
barnyard
lemonlime
spicy
yeast
and
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
superb
and
complex
flavors
of
contrasting
sweet
and
sour
lots
of
green
grass
lemon
a
variety
of
spice
including
coriander
pepper
ginger
orange
peel
and
clove
fruitry
notes
of
tart
apple
pear
and
faint
banana
pull
me
in
further
deep
and
complex
refreshing
and
satisfying
i
wish
i
had
a
bottle
to
myself
thanks
to
bruno
for
sharing
this
rare
treat
in
the
end
this
is
just
a
wonderful
mix
of
flavors
textures
and
aromas
this
beer
is
quite
good
and
is
perhaps
my
second
favorite
after
the
saison
from
this
incredible
brewery
this
holiday
belgian
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
holds
for
quite
some
time
good
amount
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smell
is
a
bit
strong
on
the
yeast
side
with
noticeable
amount
whole
hop
flowers
in
there
taste
is
really
complex
and
nicely
balanced
theres
a
slightly
sweet
honey
flavor
in
here
and
a
nice
little
peppery
kick
the
spice
is
an
additive
and
doesnt
overtake
the
beer
at
all
the
base
is
definitely
the
floral
hops
which
really
hold
the
whole
beer
together
yet
theyre
not
overdone
either
nice
little
fruit
yeast
flavor
in
there
and
the
finish
gets
slightly
bitter
and
lingers
my
only
real
fault
with
this
beer
is
that
i
notice
a
salty
flavor
that
hits
towards
the
finish
and
the
more
i
drink
the
more
noticeable
it
gets
other
than
that
this
was
a
really
good
holiday
saison
on
tap
the
waterfront
ale
house
in
nyc
as
the
bartender
said
its
from
dupont
it
smells
like
flowers
and
its
strong
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
12
inch
puffy
head
orangy
amber
cloudy
nose
of
flower
fruits
spice
and
yeast
moderate
fine
lacing
this
is
the
real
belgian
deal
light
delicate
flavorful
and
wait
its
also
9

notes
of
fresh
fruits
ginger
juniper
peppery
spice
bubble

yeasty
phenolics
yum
yum
seek
and
enjoy
drinkability
couldnt
believe
the
abv
on
this
when
i
got
home
can
barely
detect
the
alcohol
in
this
one
glad
i
tried
this
one
will
look
for
it
in
the
bottle
this
beer
is
served
in
a
tulip
and
has
a
murky
golden
body
and
a
whisp
of
a
head
of
white
which
settles
to
a
thin
lacing
on
the
surface
the
tulip
conjures
up
a
plethora
of
smells
to
create
a
powerful
nose
i
first
sense
acidic
fruit
still
sweet
but
quite
sharp
orange
lemon
cherry
next
i
detect
damp
funk
not
as
acrid
as
a
horseblanket
a
misused
term
by
many
go
visit
a
stable
and
then
make
the
comparison
but
still
just
brooding
with
wild
yeast
like
decomposing
vegetetation
finally
a
bit
of
sweet
esters
the
fruit
surges
again
then
an
outright
bubblegum
sweetness
then
a
spiciness
then
all
these
things
over
and
over
this
is
a
wonderfully
alive
in
its
flavors
they
undulate
like
waves
and
conclude
in
a
wonderful
balance
the
huge
alcohol
in
this
is
hidden
like
buried
treasure
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
as
they
complement
one
another
this
beer
is
a
treat
and
ontap
its
simply
an
experience
all
its
own
this
beer
poured
a
light
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
bubbly
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
coriander
spices
and
straw
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
spices
with
a
heavy
complex
background
hard
to
place
under
just
one
umbrella
combining
elements
of
several
and
definately
impacting
the
finish
which
seems
heavier
than
the
beer
really
is
the
finish
has
some
tartness
but
with
this
undercurrent
present
this
brew
is
going
to
be
on
my
mind
for
a
while
just
like
its
saison
cousin
avec
les
bons
voeux
has
a
magnificant
aroma
and
taste
combined
with
a
majestic
appearance
another
great
beer
from

yes

did

poured

with

and
a
huge

head
took
some
time
to
enjoy
watching
the
head
slowly
rise
higher
and
higher
as
the
bubbles
danced
furiously
underneath
garden
nose
jazzed
up
with
some
spices
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
not
sour
as
i
expected
instead
a
mellow
rich
yeasty
flavour
especially
present
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
moderately
smooth
with
some
definite
warming
very
satisfying
and
relaxing
would
pair
well
with
a
light
reading
and
log
fire
matta
is
such
a
stellar
individual
clear
liquid
gold
wearing
a
foamy
frothy

carbonated

gotta
love
such
a
complex
aroma
that
never
hinted
at
being
not
as
great
as
expected
by
me
who
still
recently
fell
under
the
charm
of
their
dupont

ultra
farmy
dry
and
yeasty
very
yeasty
obviously
like
all
other
dupont
lovely
barny
and
spicy

how
can
you
not
love
a
fine

made
me
think
of
chalk
at
times
with
awesome
white
wine
aspects
deep
spice
profile
includes
coriander
basil
pepper
thyme
mint
sage
and
just
various
other
herbs
the
first
sip
proposes
a
malty
attack
with
lots
of
dry
hay
some
apple
and
so
much
yeast
finish
is
dry
with
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
but
remains
restrained
and
balanced
aftertaste
comes
back
to
haunt
me
with
suggestions
of
dust
and
spices
and
that
scores
big
points
with
me
so
herbal
so
intense
and
no
alcohol
to
speak
of
although
theres
a
charming
warming
effect

youre
thinking
about
trying
this
ale

coriander
and
fresh
pepper
moderate
in
body
with
a
bold
carbonation
that
dances
on
the
tongue
taste
begins
with
some
tropical
fruit
and
raw
honey
followed
by
a
strong
musty
yeastiness
this
is
followed
by
an
attack
on
the
palate
by
lots
of
medical
phenols
some
spicy
coriander
and
a
bite
of
white
pepper
this
is
a
supercharged
saison
and
another
fine
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
please
take
note
that
this
is
a
limited
edition
seasonal
beer
released
in
the
winter
by
the
dupont
brewery
the
sample
just
reviewd
was
from
the
2001
batch
if
you
find
this
stuff
it
should
be
around
10
a
bottle
the
alcohol
9
5
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
drinkability
is
good
the
only
other
dupont
product
id
tried
before
this
was
it
cider
which
i
enjoyed
immensely
so
i
had
high
expectations
of
this
beer
and
was
not
disappointed
it
glows
a
nice
yellow
with
a
touch
of
orange
and
has
a
big
white
pillowy
head
that
leaves
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
are
discinctly
belglian
those
barnyard
smells
are
present
along
with
a
hint
of
medicinal
smell
the
taste
has
a
nice
tartness
bring
a
slight
pucker
to
the
mouth
it
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
as
others
have
noted
the
abv
is
wellhidden
so
dont
let
it
sneak
up
on
you
on
a
note
there
is
an
element
to
the
hops
in
the
nose
that
vaguely
reminds
me
of
a
new
can
of
tennis
balls
pours
a
bright
and
cloudy
yellow
in
color
nice
creamy
frothy
white
lasting
head
flowery

spicy
and
fruity
aromas
fruity
yeasty

and
slightly
sour
wheat
flavors
medium
boby
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
with
some
bitterness
finishes
crisp
and
dry
with
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
great
for
the
style
drinkability
notes
more
interesting
than
anything
else
certainly
a
specialty
beer
that
id
have
after
a
meal
or
if
the
meal
was
bold
enough
to
pair
it
with
that
another
one
of
those
refreshing
delights
amid
the
common
heaviness
of
winter
seasonals
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
the
big
beers
too
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
pillowy
white
head
that
lasts
forever
leaving
a
serious
coat
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
smells
of
a
bready
yeast
and
fragrant
lemony
citrus
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
but
dries
up
in
the
finish
where
youll
find
a
trace
of
hop
bitterness
there
is
a
tartness
present
which
melds
well
with
some
of
the
light
fruitiness
found
in
the
flavor
there
is
ample
carbonation
that
lends
to
a
full
and
smooth
mouthfeel
the
more
i
taste
the
more
i
realize
that
there
is
more
going
on
here
for
being
what
i
thought
was
a
lighter
beer
there
is
alot
going
on
here
citrus
light
malt
fruity
esters
and
spice
forgive
my
oxymoron
but
i
think
this
beer
is
both
light
and
rich
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
present
and
slowly
warms
the
belly
great
stuff
go
out
and
get
some
slightly
hazy
light
golden
hue
lively
bubbling
supports
a
thick
fluffy
stiff
sea
foam
like
white
head
yeast
must
and
lightly
tart
white
grapes
hit
the
nose
at
first
then
notes
of
damp
bready
malt
and
clove
surface
hint
of
dry
herbs
and
black
pepper
like
alcohol
note
of
green
apple
adds
additional
tartness
in
aroma
fairly
dry
and
tart
overall
aromawise
contrary
to
the
aroma
the
flavor
profile
abounds
in
a
pleasant
light
sweetness
the
initial
honey
like
sweetness
morphs
into
a
fruity
melange
of
grape
and
pear
then
is
immediately
contrasted
by
green
apple
medicinal
phenols
and
notes
of
black
licorice
hint
of
heaty
solvent
like
fusels
lightly
bodied
agreeably
crisp
mouthfeel
finishes
herbally
sweet
with
pronounced
clove
and
an
impression
of
dried
oregano
an
intense
flavorful
beer
strong
on
the
medicinal
phenols
and
higher
alcohols
perhaps
further
cellaring
to
tame
this
brew
would
elevate
it
to
excellence
bottled
2002
im
obviously
a
big
fan
of
all
the
dupont
brews
this
winter
seasonal
is
in
the
same
vein
as
their
saison
and
the
moinette
blonde
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
and
good
lace
pattern
down
the
glass
the
same
pepperyfruity
nose
and
palate
but
with
a
stronger
yeasty
flavor
in
the
back
and
then
the
traditional
hoppy
finish
also
the
highest
carbonation
of
all
the
dupont
beers
ive
tried
if
this
had
been
in
town
in
december
a
merry
christmas
i
would
have
had
indeed
color
is
golden
and
clear
huge
head
that
quickly
vanishes
aroma
of
malt
citrus
and
even
a
little
frankincense
theres
a
nice
and
subtile
bitterness
in
the
taste
which
makes
it
an
enjoyable
thirstquenching
beer
i
can
proclaim
with
complete
certainty
that
among
the
best
saison
ive
tried
was
a
bottle
labeled
saison
dupont
vieille
provision
however
i
can
also
say
that
this
beer
has
struck
me
as
often
as
not
as
a
merely
good
not
great
representation
of
the
style
not
sure
how
to
account
for
the
discrepancy
except
to
suggest
that
fresher
is
better
but
id
strongly
recommend
it
either
way
o
i
love
saison
dupont
and
try
to
pick
a
few
up
on
a
regular
basis
just
a
staple
for
what
a
great
saison
can
be
if
you
can
get
this
i
suggest
you
do
so
this
is
a
bottle
of
greatness
poured
a
gorgeous

a
half

mensjournal100best2014
great
feel
somewhat
effervescent
in
the

best
light
beer
ive
ever
had
oabsolutely
fantastic
saison
great
complexity
and
extremely
drinkable
wild
yeasts
barnyard
earthiness
with
a
distinct
nonhop
bitter
aftertaste
overall
not
my
favorite
saison
but
a
great
and
classic
example
of
the
style
definitely
unique
complex
and
refreshing
very
few
beers
seem
to
have
this
much
fruityspicy
yeast
character
as
well
as
being
this
bone
dry
simply
wonderful
o
very
refreshing
beer
will
definitely
revisit
in
the
summer
so
this
is
like
the
standard
bearer
for
saisons
right
you
know
what
it
tasted
like
every
other
well
done
saison
ive
tried
i
mean
it
was
yummy
but
it
wasnt
some
transcendent
experience
it
just
tasted
like
a
good
saison
i
guess
maybe
there
isnt
much
variation
in
this
style
stones
version
is
the
only
true
exception
ive
come
across
great
bottle
beer
smells
intense
taste
is
well
rounded
an
interesting
saison
as
the
more
common
fruitiness
does
not
show
itself
until
the
very
end
of
the
after
taste
good
beer
no
weak
spot
on
this
beer
just
leave
a
sediment
in
the
bottle
and
dont
pour
it
in
the
glass
it
reminded
me
of
witbier
colour
belgian
pale
ales
tripels
and
even
orval
and
gueuze
refreshing
and
light
yet
full
of
taste
citrusy
mild
funky
grassy
excellent
but
pricey
saisson
beer
nice
fruit
in
the
front
mellows
out
to
an
orange
after
taste
not
too
strong
but
not
too
light
so
overall
good
balance
and
taste
the
iconic
saison
dupont
pours
hazy
gold
under
a
2
persistent
white
foam
cap
that
provides
intricate
lace
a
light
fruit
pineapple
nose
combines
with
light
bread
aromas
and
a
trace
of
well
ripened
fruit
it
starts
crisp
and
dry
on
the
plate
with
a
trace
of
fruit
primarily
orange
that
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
seasoned
with
spice
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
over
biscuity
malt
a
moderate
hop
accent
brings
it
together
on
the
finish
it
has
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
medium
body
if
you
get
a
good
one
the
large
green
75
cl
bottles
are
better
the
brown
33
cl
ones
but
about
one
in
4
of
the
larger
bottles
is
skunky
beer
perfection
so
many
flavors
so
balanced
overall
prototypical
saison
classic
taste
with
a
light
body
and
dry
finish
saison
is
not
my
style
of
choice
but
this
is
a
refreshing
nice
beer
great
for
a
hot
australian
summer
day
what
can
you
say
it
defines
the
style
a
bit
dryer
than
most
american
saison
the
best
looking
beer
ever
taste
matches
up
to
it
its
awesome
i
love
a
thick
head
and
this
one
pillows
out
great
with
anything
must
try
i
love
saisons
and
this
one
is
a
good
one
overall
started
out
good
but
theres
a
dry
flavour
that
s
a
bit
too
bold
still
very
good
and
drinkable
poured
into
tall
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
some
reddish
tones
four
finger
pure
white
head
that
mostly
persists
but
slowly
dissipates
leaving
tons
of
lacing
champagnelike
bubbles
aroma
is
of
yeast
bread
crackers
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
lemon
taste
is
of
bread
and
crackers
yeast
some
citrus
and
eventually
some
spice
mouth
is
clean
and
dry
super
refreshing
overall
a
classic
saison
and
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
375ml
bottle
poured
into
a
goblet
color
yellow
thick
rocky
white

slightly
skunky
probably
complements
of
the
green
bottle
flavor
well
balanced
sweetness
and
hoppiness
some
pepper
like
spiciness
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
rate
this
a

slightly
cloudy
light
golden
color
smell
is
of
bananas
and
citrus
taste
has
bananahefeweizen
notes
with
a
clean
finish
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
special
o
ill
open
this
part
by
restating
my
disclaimer
that
i
am
overly
sensitive
to
hop
flavors
and
as
such
my
reviews
likely
do
not
apply
to
the
majority
this
beer
is
a
tad
heavy
on
the
hops
for
my
taste
obscuring
most
of
the
malt
profile
and
likely
much
of
the
yeast
complexity
as
well
this
drank
closer
to
a
hoppy
wheat
ale
than
a
saison
for
me
other
folks
will
likely
find
this
to
be
balanced
and
more
complex
o
only
my
second
saison
but
i
have
liked
them
both
will
definitely
try
some
more
when
the
opportunity
arises
the
actual
taste
differs
a
lot
from
the
aromas
it
evokes
a
much
warmer
feeling
on
the
palate
than
the
aromas
revealed
due
to
soft
yeast
straw
peppery
hints
tart
lemon
pear
and
spices
has
an
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
which
is
just
outraging
soft
on
the
palate
with
added
complexity
from
the
slightly
biting
savory
spices
among
peppery
notes
and
lively
metallic
carbonation
pleasant
floral
hops
act
as
an
enjoyable
counterpart
with
the
addition
of
earthy
malts
to
the
sweeter
spices
the
palate
is
simply
perfect
substantial
and
round
up
front
finishing
very
dry
and
lightly
fizzy
outstanding
well
balances
beer
which
is
close
to
perfection
in
taste
with
a
particular
complex
body
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
has
a
very
floral
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
hard
to
describe
but
is
quite
good
refreshing
and
very
crisp
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
spiciness
on
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thinner
mouth
feel
a
great
beer
overall
very
balanced
flavor
just
about
everyone
will
love
this
would
buy
again
and
plan
on
it
overall
great
saison
well
balanced
would
buy
again
4050
overall
one
of
the
musthaves
of
the
saison
style
o
not
going
to
hold
the
skunking
against
it
as
im
seeing
that
its
pretty
common
to
this
beer
i
sure
wish
they
would
reconsider
the
green
bottles
though
i
understand
why
this
is
the
classic
example
of
a
saison
from
the
big
foamy
pour
to
the
quenching
finish
this
is
a
solid
great
beer
allaround
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
massive
pillowy
fluffy
white
head
highly
carbonated
smells
massively
of
graphite
and
iron
with
a
dash
of
grass
and
a
crisp
autumn
day
tastes
mellow
and
of
fresh
milky
oats
and
grains
finishes
with
grassy
earthiness
not
a
bright
green
grass
taste
but
more
of
a
dusty
grey
dried
out
grass
in
late
summer
after
a
few
sips
some
of
the
earthiness
melts
away
and
just
leaves
a
mellow
sweetness
with
a
very
mild
caramel
sugar
pretty
darn
tasty
i
expected
this
to
be
a
little
more
delicate
but
still
refreshing
for
being
widely
regarded
as
the
best
saison
ever
i
think
my
expectations
were
a
little
high
i
bought
this
with
very
high
expectations
i
let
it
chill
for
a
few
days
before
opening
it
when
i
did
open
it
it
was
skunked
and
tasted
like
an
old
heineken
which
is
not
what
this
should
taste
like
very
disappointed
but
it
was
probably
stored
improperly
so
i
will
give
another
chance
but
from
a
different
store
overall
enjoyable
refreshing
complex
brisk
and
intense
this
legend
did
not
disappoint
although
its
a
beer
that
does
requires
some
patience
to
deconstruct
and
understand
overall
this
is
the
textbook
definition
of
what
a
saison
should
be
pretty
much
the
defining
beer
for
the
style
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
can
see
why
this
beer
in
one
of
the
bench
mark
saisons
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
it
if
you
like
this
style
then
you
need
to
put
it
on
your
must
drink
list
this
was
good
dry
and
herbal
and
somewhat
spicy
straw
colored
visible
floaters
slightly
hazy
white
head
with
persistent
lace
hops
were
a
nice
backdrop
to
some
fruitiness
and
malt
very
clean
and
crisp
somewhat
of
an
apple
cider
crispness
in
the
taste
and
slight
apple
in
the
nose
pretty
drinkable
alcohol
pretty
well
hidden
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
was
good
and
interesting
i
picked
up
a
small
bottle
on
clearance
a
few
years
ago
ive
been
buying
it
again
and
again
ever
since
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
quite
nice
saison
with
a
great
drinkability
and
a
fantastic
fruity
sweetyet
nicely
soured
and
funked
flavor
rather
refreshing
crisp
and
delicious
o
very
nice
saison
certainly
one
of
the
main
stays
for
the
style
o
not
as
spicy
as
i
would
have
expected
yet
the
brett
in
here
is
really
nice
its
mellow
and
isnt
overwhelming
the
grapesapples
combined
with
the
wheat
flavors
make
this
a
really
refreshing
beer
yet
combined
with
the
brett
make
this
all
come
together
nicely
and
brings
the
flavors
blended
together
really
nicely
a
classic
belgian
saison
ale
which
pours
slightly
cloudy
to
a
brilliant
golden
color
a
abundance
of
carbonation
leaves
a
huge
fluffy
head
which
lasts
much
longer
than
most
heads
fabulous
lacings
remain
while
the
ale
is
consumed
the
taste
is
citrusy
crisp
dry
and
effervescent
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
and
ends
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
which
in
this
case
is
a
plus
the
alcohol
content
is
6
5
which
is
a
little
higher
than
most
saisons
and
is
also
a
good
thing
the
ale
came
in
a
75
cl
bottle
format
o
this
beer
is
classic
for
a
reason
well
when
its
not
skunked
and
thats
because
its
so
damn
effortless
and
perfectly
balanced
the
more
good
saisons
i
drink
the
more
i
absolutely
adore
the
style
i
dont
even
care
that
this
was
a
bit
skunked
i
will
buy
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
as
long
as
i
know
im
getting
it
fresh
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
might
even
be
sessionable
if
it
werent
for
the
slightly
aboveaverage
abv
this
is
not
the
must
unique
of
flavorladen
saison
out
there
but
has
a
fine
balance
and
was
a
fine
drink
on
a
summer
evening
on
the
porch
i
found
overall
a
smooth
tasty
saison
classic
saison
with
an
apparent
clean
taste
but
that
carries
a
good
fruity
complexity
spices
and
hops
o
there
are
reasons
why
the
classics
are
the
classics
this
is
such
a
pure
clean
rendition
of
the
farmhouse
style
i
loved
it
and
will
add
it
to
my
regular
rotation
malty
smell
with
fruit
spice
and
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
begins
with
sweet
malts
followed
by
wheaty
tartness
with
notes
of
pepper
and
hops
finishes
with
a
dry
and
bitter
spicy
aftertaste
mediumlight
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
a
bit
watery
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
a
good
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
would
have
again
carbonation
is
also
good
medium
size
bubbles
and
not
overly
carbonated
o
a
classic
of
the
style
not
as
bold
as
many
of
the
new
american
versions
but
super
drinkable

no
skunky
oxidized
hop
flavors
or
aromas
loved
it
o
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
had
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
you
have
not
already
never
again
o
dupont
is
the
benchmark
of
a
historical
and
inspiring
beer
great
for
the
seasoned
beer
nerd
or
rookie
just
wanting
something
drinkable
sessionable
well
balanced
and
just
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
fun
dupont
is
a
legend
but
i
think
spring
hopper
saison
held
up
well
and
gives
inspiration
for
the
future
overall
impression
is
i
do
like
this
style
and
could
drink
more
of
it
i
like
the
clove
tropical
fruit
and
funk
mix
its
also
very
smooth
which
makes
it
a
warmer
weather
beverage
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
quintessence
of
the
style
and
i
do
like
that
about
it
some
of
the
american
breweries
that
are
making
the
style
are
mucking
it
up
with
all
these
herbal
additions
leave
the
yeast
to
do
the
job
my
friends
and
it
should
speak
for
itself
this
is
a
good
overall
beer
o
great
beer
refreshing
with
a
lot
of
yeast
spiciness
great
example
of
the
style
o
great
beer
no
question
unfortunately
at
6
retail
for
the
bottle
that
i
purchased
the
value
is
not
here
on
this
one
only
slightly
better
than
some
more
reasonably
priced
saisons
that
i
have
enjoyed
in
the
past
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
frothy
twofinger
head
earthy
bread
hay
and
grape
fill
the
nose
those
tastes
along
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
barnyard
funk
predominate
the
taste
medium
mouth
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
crisp
this
isnt
my
favorite
saison
but
its
very
enjoyable
o
great
beer
even
being
skunked
or
maybe
i
am
just
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
and
saisons
are
supposed
to
have
a
strong
skunk
aroma
i
would
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
another
bottle
to
maybe
see
its
full
potential
nice
enjoyable
crisp
yet
slightly
funky
belgian
brew
i
enjoy
this
one
and
would
recommend
to
others
wooo
just
thinking
about
it
raul
needs
to
take
a
shower
hazy
light
golden
colored
with
an
inch
thick
dense

head
of
foam
brussels
lacing
vibrant
carbonation
aroma
is
of
saison
yeast
with
peppery
spicy
notes
slight
hints
of
pear
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
of
pale
malt
and
gentle
spice
notes
from
the
saison
yeast
the
overall
impression
is
lots
of
flavor
from
something
so
subtle
and
smooth
what
else
can
be
said
saison
dupont
is
a
benchmark
saison
brewed
to
perfection
i
love
this
beer
perfect
if
youve
never
tried
a
saison
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
cheers
o
my
first
saison
and
although
i
have
nothing
else
to
base
it
on
i
loved
it
will
definitely
be
looking
into
some
other
ones
to
try
i
loved
the
fruitiness
of
this
one
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
very
bubblegum
smell
and
taste
which
was
pleasant
anything
belgian
screams
my
name
prost
o
really
tasty
sharp
and
light
something
that
makes
you
think
pours

color
with
a
thick

head
retention
and

are
excellent
strong
clove
and
banana
aroma
on
the
sweeter
side
has
a
good
belgium
malty
taste
up
front
with
a
nice
peppery
spicy
hoppy
finish
you
do
get
some
banana
and
cloves
in
there
carbonation
is
high
very
good
saison
but
i
would
expect
it
from
this
beer
o
saison
dupont
is
the
quintessential
example
of
the
saisonfarmhouse
ale
many
have
tried
to
mimic
it
but
few
are
truly
worthy
of
standing
in
its
company
needless
to
say
this
is
an
absolute
mustdrink
for
any
true
beer
geek
pairing
options
are
endless
but
salads
and
lighter
fare
are
easy
choices
white
fish
and
chicken
as
well
along
with
a
multitude
of
different
herb
and
spice
combos
fried
portobello
mushrooms
just
popped
into
my
head
too
maybe
play
up
the
funk
a
little
bit
its
very
versatile
as
it
wont
overwhelm
the
more
delicate
dishes
but
can
cut
through
bolder
flavors
and
richer
textures
as
well
well
rounded
little
saison
unique
and
satisfying
would
love
to
try
again
any
time
worth
seeking
out
o
this
was
good
but
it
was
quite
pricey
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
the
money
to
me
but
it
was
a
pretty
good
saison
though
i
do
prefer
the
darker
belgian
varieties
overall
cant
say
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
i
know
it
gets
some
high
reviews
but
i
just
dont
see
it
that
way
the
saison
dupont
gets

delightful

not

well

the
belgian

more
prevalently
but
is
again
not
unpleasantly
one
dimensional
there
are
enough
malted
grains
to
support
the
banana
and
coriander
without
being
overpowered
and
a
respectably
clean
bitterness
in
the
finish
o
a
solid
reliable
refreshing
saison
it
wont
wow
you
but
wont
disappoint
either
o
its
a
burning
tire
saison
most
of
the
flavors
and
smells
are
pretty
good
but
its
kinda
hard
to
overcome
the
burning
tires
meh
it
loses
points
for
trying
to
kill
me
too
i
find
this
beer
to
be
nearly
perfect
as
saison
is
my
favorite
style
right
now
the
only
detractor
to
me
is
how
impossible
it
is
to
pour
off
the
bottle
without
40
to
70
head
this
beer
is
so
obviously
made
using
champagne
yeast
i
believe
nitroglycerin
might
be
less
reactive
other
than
that
everything
about
this
beer
is
dead
on
cork
has
2
011
stamped
on
it
so
im
assuminghoping
that
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
but
really
who
knows
maybe
it
was
bottled
in
february
this
year
maybe
its
been
sitting
on
display
for
almost
9
months
maybeits
just
beer
whatever
the
case
is
time
and
a
green
bottle
has
done
nothing
to
diminish
the
appearance
of
the
beer
as
it
comes
out
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
generous
cloud
of
foam
that
doesnt
want
to
dissipate
big
airy
bubbles
give
off
an
aroma
full
of
green
apple
zest
and
dampened
straw
first
taste
coats
the
mouth
with
a
bubbly
funky
inviting
mix
of
pleasing
welcome
flavors
i
imagine
green
apple
nectar
a
light
floral
pollenlike
delicate
touch
mixed
with
a
pleasing
crisp
and
edgy
acidity
some
damp
straw
a
dry
finish
effervescent
vitality
my
only
question
is
can
i
have
some
more
with
the
moderate
abv
and
a
750
ml
bottle
all
to
my
lonesome
the
answer
is
yes
yes
i
can
rjt
a
really
nice
beer
with
a
good
balance
but
one
that
must
be
given
time
to
settle
down
first
before
drinking
it
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
in
the
world
champagne
like
and
i
agree
with
other
review
that
it
is
a
nice
way
to
cut
high
fat
content
foods
like
pork
belly
a
veritable
classic
saison
dupont
is
a
great
example
of
a
saison
it
is
crisp
refreshing
with
a
lively
spicy
yeast
character
but
overall
i
feel
that
i
have
had
much
better
saisons
dupont
definitely
fires
on
all
cylinders
but
like
the
flavor
profile
drops
out
before
it
really
hits
it
peak
on
your
palate
i
think
vietnamese
and
thai
food
would
pair
beautifully
with
this
beer
highly
recommended
if
not
just
for
a
solid
baseline
to
compare
modern
renditions
of
a
saison
to
love
the
bottle
with
its
wine
size
and
cork
an
excellent
beer
to
share
with
friends
or
someone
special
only
slight
criticism
is
its
lack
of
big
aroma
but
everything
else
is
brilliant
and
more
than
makes
up
for
it
classic
saison
that
arrived
a
pale
straw
with
ample
white
head
aroma
was
a
bit
subdued
but
yeasty
esters
and
citrus
were
notable
along
with
some
herbs
and
peanut
butter
sweet
malt
in
the
mouth
beer
was
a
heady
mix
of
orange
spice
tea
lemon
clove
white
pepper
herbal
perfume
apple
and
cashew
brittle
all
integrated
well
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
did
not
notice
the
funk
that
some
describe
pleasing
combination
of
malt
and
spice
with
a
dryness
that
evokes
champagne
and
a
surprising
nuttiness
overall
although
i
can
easily
understand
why
this
beer
is
seen
as
a
staple
in
the
saison
style
its
not
my
favorite
dont
misunderstand
me
id
still
have
one
of
those
as
often
as
they
come
but
ive
tasted
some
products
even
within
the
dupont
brewery
itself
that
pleased
me
much
more
than
this
still
very
fine
beer
o
very
enjoyable
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
appearance
was
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
enough
head
to
choke
an
elephant
on
par
for
the
brew
i
am
told
lots
of
rotten
ripe
fruit
straight
up
the
nose
followed
by
classic
belgian
spice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
sour
twang
added
to
the
mix
lots
of
carb
and
a
cool
brew
over
all
love
the
mini
champagne
bottle
o
deliciously
refreshing
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
saison
dupont
and
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
not
a
disappointment
at
all
im
now
convinced
that
the
best
setting
to
drink
a
farmhouse
ale
is
on
the
second
floor
of
a
barn
looking
out
over
a
catskill

not

like

a
damn
good
beer
a
great

a
well

yeasty

o
my
first
true
belgian
saison
i
have
to

i
appreciate
this
beer
quite
a

i
found
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
to
be
more

than
the
other
saisons
i
have
had
the
finish
was
very
nice
and
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
impressive
beer
overall
while
its
not
my
favourite
for
the
style
its
a
great
representation
and
should
be
on
the
short
list
of
saisons
to
try
for
anyone
entering
craft

this
is

a

out

o
i
can
dig
it
a

different
take
on
the

i
can
certainly

why
it
is
a

a
wonderful
saison
and
one
of
my
favorites
after
drinking
this
beer
you
will
certainly
understand
why
some
people
consider
it
the
standard
overall
fantastic
brew
that
is
a
treat
for
anyone
who
enjoys
a
saison
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
high
levels
of
carbonation
that
manager
to
never
feel
fizzy
but
immediately
produce
a
foamy
rich
mouthfeel
with
each
sip
closes
dry
with
little
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
this
is
one
delicious
and
easydrinking
beer
lots
going
on
and
not
just
a
session
drinker
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
long
and
not
feel
im
just
consuming
malt
yeast
and
hops
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
lots
of
flavor
flowers
and
fruits
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
excellent
overall
a
good
introduction
into
this
style
refreshing
summer
drink
oive
been
trying
more
saisons
this
summer
and
this
might
be
my
favorite
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
saisons
the
smell
was
sweet
and
the
first
sip
was
as
good
as
last
i
could
see
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
hanging
out
with
friends
o
a
moderately
strongflavored
beer
that
would
likely
pair
well
with
a
fullbodied
french
cheese
memo
to
me
for
next
time
the
dry
bitter
finish
detracted
a
little
from
the
experience
but
overall
it
was
worth
trying
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
because
its
blended
very
well
it
has
a
sour
component
not
really
bitter
but
it
is
also
very
sweet
its
so
bubbly
like
drinking
champagne
but
it
tastes
better
than
champagne
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
for
new
years
overall
havent
had
many
saisons
but
this
one
is
absolutely
amazing
and
is
so
well
balanced
this
would
be
my
first
choice
for
best
representation
of
the
style
overall
excellent
saison
boom
brasserie
dupont
nails
it
easily
one
of
their
best
o
the
best
saison
ive
tasted
so
far
im
just
upset
that
a
style
thats
so
gorgeous
is
so
difficult
to
find
varieties
of
in
pennsylvania
more
subtle
but
also
rather
complex
really
a
good
thirst
quencher
o
soft
and
light
saison
with
some
nice
floral
tones
overall
a
wonderful
saison
definitely
deserves
all
the
praise
that
it
has
received
if
you
are
new
to
saisons
and
looking
for
one
to
try
let
it
be
this
one
o
this
is
a
great
saison
almost
has
a
flavor
profile
similar
to
some
tripels
but
has
big
flavor
and
is
quenching
o
really
good
saison
brew
this
is
my
first
time
having
a
belgium
saison
style
and
the
closest
i
can
compare
it
to
is
champagne
not
a
cheap
bottle
of
champagne
but
a
good
style
this
is
mouth
filling
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
bit
funky
just
like
a
champagne
however
you
get
this
taste
of
coriander
maybe
some
citrus
flavor
fruits
and
no
taste
of
alcohol
what
so
ever
this
is
a
great
beer
to
try
pick
it
up
very
straightforward
and
refreshing
while
still
being
interestingly
complex
saison
dupont
is
a
must
try
if
you
have
even
the
slightest
interest
in
belgianstyle
ales
this
is
what
beer
should
always
taste
like
smooth
flavorful
but
always
crisp
and
refreshing
at
the
finish
very
strong
fruity
and
citrus
flavors
up
front
mixed
with
a
heavy
wheat
body
the
finish
is
pure
summer
hefeweizen
the
belgium
people
know
beer
like
no
other
i
am
in
awe
of
this
simple
yet
powerful
brew
fruity
earthy
and
dry
this
is
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
its
a
bit
more
earthy
and
dry
than
i
prefer
but
great
example
of
the
style
o
i
had
read
that
there
could
be
infected
or
skunky
batch
floating
around
the
lcbo
and
unfortunately
i
think
i
was
subject
to
this
aforementioned
group
that
being
said
a
flavourful
brew
was
detectable
amidst
the
skunk
i
would
give
this
brew
another
chance
but
unfortunately
i
know
my
local
lcbo
likely
wont
be
privy
to
another
batch
o
i
wish
i
would
have
let
this
beer
age
longer
it
tastes
tight
and
hard
now
and
would
perhaps
broaden
with
some
age
still
a
wonderfully
delicate
beer
it
went
perfect
with
our
fusili
with
fresh
uncooked
tomato
basil
garlic
sauce
pine
nuts
the
beer
is
just
wonderful
i
can
only
compare
it
to
sofie
and
hennepin
i
would
compare
it
more
to
hennepin
but
this
wins
the
dry
wonderful
finish
is
lovely
i
would
enjoy
having
this
on
a
hot
day
or
with
something
spicy
or
seafood
an
incredible
saison
one
of
the
best

really

certainly
something
that

pours
a

rich
medium
cloudy
but
easy

see
through

good

the

yeasty
edge
almost

clean

very
refreshing

crisp

light
on

this
is
a
classic
saison
and
it
has
a
refreshing
and
clean
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
quite
good
though
not
necessarily
my
favorite
take
despite
the
importance
of
the
beer
overall
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
standardbearers
for
the
farmhouse
style
i
prefer
my
saisons
to
be
a
little
more
inyourface
with
some
more
funk
and
dankess
but
this
one
is
clearly
versatile
for
multiple
seasons
and
cuisines
this
beer
was
offered
to
me
as
the
o
g
saison
i
could
believe
this
beer
has
inspired
a
brewer
or
two
its
an
exhilirating
balance
of
complex
spicy
bitterness
light
sweetness
and
a
uique
and
forward
acidity
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
hazy
hue
giant
head
sticky
leftovers
as
it
settles
and
plenty
of
lacing
as
you
drink
it
down
nose
is
heavy
bread
with
some
peanut
and
fermented
fruit
bready
flavor
with
some
pine
bite
offset
with
some
faint
allegations
of
fruit
dry
light
and
papery
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
o
tis
is
a
nearly
perfect
saison
its
too
bad
more
than
half
the
bottles
ive
had
are
skunked
this
beer
has
been
far
better
than
other
bottles
ive
had
though
its
balanced
complex
and
refreshing
pretty
much
the
perfect
saison
if
you
havent
tried
it
its
certainly
worth
a
try
o
a
refreshing
and
bright
beer
which
draws
true
strength
from
the
yeast
a
necessary
beer
to
experience
for
anyone
who
wishes
to
understand
belgian
beer
styles
at
8
99
at
bevmo
this
brew
will
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
for
the
warm
season
which
is
settling
upon
los
angeles
oa
great
saison
love
everything
about
it
the
nose
and
taste
are
very
complex
and
make
it
hard
to
decipher
exactly
what
you
are
experiencing
extremely
enjoyable
however
and
easy
to
drink
overall
really
great
saison
love
the
look
and
feel
of
this
beer
the
most
a
benchmark
beer
for
the
style
its
a
must
try
beer
an
8
shelf
beer
in
a
large
format
bottle
great
value
and
a
well
crafted
brew
walk
together
hand
in
hand
o
this
is
a
really
nice
saison
it
hits
on
what
id
expect
from
a
one
barnyard
tart
fruit
and
flowers
dry
and
easy
drinking
its
all
there
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
ill
gladly
seek
out
in
the
hotter
months
i
love
belgians
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
o
refreshing
almost
a
lawn
mower
beer
this
is
not
a
saison
that
gives
you
some
funky
farmyard
which
i
like
very
much
but
i
love
it
super
refreshing
and
tastey
but
this
bottle
feels
sort
of
old
that
or
this
is
just
decent
well
balanced
though
food
match
the
vinous
character
of
this
beer
would
most
suit
anything
that
goes
well
with
white
wine
light
pasta
fish
and
asian
cuisine
in
fact
this
brew
has
flavours
that
would
compliment
anything
bar
game
meats
and
chargrilled
steaks
o
a
great
example
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
especially
after
brewing
a
batch
of
saison
my
self
a
perfect
beer
to
have
after
a
hard
days
work
definitely
would
have
hit
the
spot
after
a
hard
days
work
on
the
farm
overall
a
fine
and
exemplary
saison
nothing
very
exciting
just
a
well
made
beer
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
have
had
many
other
saisons
that
i
enjoy
much
more
i
dont
think
ill
be
returning
to
this
beer
in
the
future
overall
this
is
the
most
classic
saison
you
can
have
as
far
as
flavor
and
smell
although
it
is
high
in
alcohol
for
a
traditional
saison
like
was
made
in
olden
farming
days
of
belgium
but
nonetheless
it
is
everything
a
saison
was
meant
to
be
which
is
thirst
quenching
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
tasty
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
out
of
belgium
from
a
375
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
live
life
drink
beer
overall
a
very
nice
beer
very
refreshing
i
can
see
drinking
this
during
the
heat
of
the
summer
or
now
in
the
winter
to
think
about
the
days
of
summer
the
orange
smell
steps
out
right
away
from
the
beautiful
sunny
glass
the
taste
also
brings
the
oranges
together
with
subtle
floral
tones
i
can
notice
a
black
pepper
tone
but
strongly
associated
with
the
aroma
while
taking
the
sip
the
end
is
dry
with
a
wellbalanced
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
beer
with
character
overall
this
was
my
first
saison
i
have
had
krieks
and
lambics
before
but
i
think
saison
suits
me
a
little
better
also
considering
the
size
of
the
bottle
750ml
the
abv
6
5
and
the
price
approx
au1213
a
bottle
in
2013
it
is
actually
quite
decent
value
not
cheap
but
i
dont
expect
a
specialty
belgian
ale
to
be
cheap
by
any
means
this
one
is
worth
it
o
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
drinking
this
beer
when
smelling
the
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
ripe
with
funky
flavors
when
it
came
to
tasting
it
was
a
complete
polar
shift
i
found
that
my
glass
appeared
to
empty
much
quicker
than
other
saisons
ive
had
it
is
not
full
of
sourness
or
horsey
barnyard
smells
and
flavors
at
least
to
me
it
is
very
subtle
in
all
flavors
and
they
meld
nicely
this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
opaque
light
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
light
and
yeasty
with
orange
peel
lemon
rhind
aged
hops
belgian
yeast
and
a
light
floral
character
the
flavors
too
are
light
and
citrusy
there
is
a
light
orange
sweetness
followed
by
the
lemon
bitterness
a
touch
of
corn
old
hops
and
light
hibiscus
and
tea
i
would
say
i
prefer
the
nose
a
little
more
it
drinks
very
light
and
is
definitely
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
great
for
warmer
weather
overall
this
is
a
fine
saison
and
one
that
at
10
is
a
must
try

refreshing
and
satisfying
easydrinking
one
of
the
classic
saisons
and
one
ive
been
meaning
to
try
again
and
review
for
awhile
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
pale
honey
colored
in
appearance
and
a
bit
cloudy
with
an
absolutely
massive
white
foam
head
like
a
giant
snow
bank
a
big
old
white
pillow
that
hardly
subsides
at
all
the
nose
is
delicate
pitted
fruit
and
a
moderately
spicy
belgian
yeast
wheat
malt
and
yeast
are
the
first
two
flavors
i
pick
up
but
there
is
a
gentle
summery
sweetness
in
the
back
end
with
golden
raisins
peaches
and
wildflowers
amazing
how
all
these
subtleties
come
together
in
a
beer
that
remains
so
light
and
airy
effervescent
carbonation
makes
it
feel
even
lighter
in
the
mouth
and
although
the
body
isnt
that
light
it
really
feels
like
drinking
a
cloud
super
sessionable
in
the
summertime
for
sure
and
a
nice
reminder
in
the
winter
that
summer
will
come
again
as
it
always
does
one
of
the
better
widely
available
saisons
out
there
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
it
was
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
everything
from
the
mouthfeel
to
the
taste
were
just
as
they
should
be
this
beer
had
very
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
with
some
nice
flavors
that
held
my
attention
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
during
the
summertime
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
clean
and
complex
it
was
nothing
was
muddled
and
there
was
a
good
amount
going
in
the
aroma
and
taste
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
price
i
know
its
not
cheap
to
import
awesome
beer
from
belgium
but
its
a
little
too
pricey
for
me
to
buy
often
if
it
was
cheaper
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
often
in
the
summertime
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
only
once
in
a
while
i
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
gave
me
a
good
idea
as
to
what
a
traditional
belgium
saison
tastes
like
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
have
had
a
couple
american
saisons
that
are
just
about
on
the
same
level
ill
have
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
beers
from
this
brewery
saison
dupont
has
a
nice
light
body
with
active
carb
the
flavor
rolls
through
the
mouth
linger
a
bit
and
dissipate
leaving
a
mild
grassy
taste
afterwards
easy
to
take
down
with
the
light
alcohol
easy
to
take
down
quicker
easy
drinking
right
here
if
it
was
available
in
an
affordable
six
pack
this
would
be
a
no
brainer
this
is
a
damn
fine
saison
classic
profile
with
an
added
dose
of
welcome
funk
overy
nice
and
very
refreshing
would
make
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
while
it
isnt
quite
on
the
level
of
boulevard
saison
brett
you
cant
expect
that
out
of
all
saisons
this
is
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
to
saison
and
farmhiuse
drinkers
55
just
started
to
get
into
saisons
and
have
found
them
to
be
extremely
refreshing
this
is
one
of
the
best
a
nice
cloudy
golden
pour
with
a
huge
white
head
nice
lacing
on
my
glass
great
aroma
of
bread
honey
citrus
and
black
pepper
a
wonderful
refreshing
brew
with
spices
and
tartness
perfect
combination
overall
an
excellent
saison
nice
balance
without
being
overly
fruity
could
taste
a
little
fresher
o
complex
and
balanced
not
a
flavor
that
is
for
everyone
if
one
likes
plain
beer
taste
this
will
be
too
different
4
5
d
superb
farmhouse
and
a
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
very
good
complexity
and
superb
balance
are
both
qualities
that
stand
out
for
me
201409
had
a
more
aged
bottle
750
ml
complex
stone
fruit
aromas
amazing
complex
fruity
and
eatery
flavour
with
a
gentle
acidity
on
the
finish
so
great
notes
a
top
notch
saison
very
sessionable
cheers
overall
trying
a
belgian
saison
for
the
first
time
and
im
impressed
with
it
aside
from
the
fact
it
lacked
a
strong
malty
backbone
i
have
to
say
it
was
really
good
i
say
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
youre
into
saisons
and
looking
for
something
just
a
bit
different
d
an
excellent
beer
on
tap
it
is
delicious
and
was
a
welcome
finish
to
my
first
day
in
belgium
o
a
fantastic
saison
not
too
tart
but
very
funky
easily
one
of
the
driest
beers
ive
ever
had
love
it
this
beer
pours
a
thick
white
and
foamy
head
careful
pouring
is
a
must
immediately
one
is
greeted
with
an
inviting
fruity
aroma
mostly
citrus
but
others
lurk
amongst
them
the
appearance
is
a
medium
golden
color
similar
to
some
wheat
beers
i
would
describe
the
taste
as
first
bready
then
slightly
sweet
followed
by
citrus
sour
very
delicious
and
very
refreshing
i
would
drink
this
after
a
hard
day
of
labor
the
mouth
feel
is
very
similar
to
champagne
nice
and
smooth
with
a
sharpness
upon
swallowing
the
saison
by
which
other
saisons
are
measured
very
good
overall
great
introduction
to
this
style
really
like
how
refreshing
it
tastes
on
a
hot
late
september
ga
day
reasonably
priced
too
would
love
to
revisit
diamonds
are
forever
overall
this
is
a
classic
saison
that
probably
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
if
they
are
at
all
remotely
adventurous
beyond
the
standard
aal
hoppy
ales
this
is
a
classic
saison
and
its
easy
to
see
why
i
dont
think
i
would
suggest
this
to
newbies
the
herbal
hoppy
nature
might
not
appeal
to
an
inexperienced
palate
fans
of
the
style
should
love
it
its
expensive
but
sooner
or
later
every
ba
must
try
this
you
wont
regret
it
o
the
quintessential
farmhouse
ale
if
you
want
to
find
out
whether
or
not
you
like
saisons
try
this
first
o
this
is
an
excellent
base
saison
nothing
crazy
or
fancy
but
seriously
very
well
done
recommended
in
short
versatile
pop
it
open
during
a
formal
celebration
or
open
while
kicking
back
on
the
porch
on
a
sunny
day
or
sit
by
the
fire
on
a
freezing
day
with
cheese
and
bread
no
matter
what
occasion
saison
dupont
will
be
apropos
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
unlike
any
ive
had
and
being
far
less
overwhelming
in
sourness
compared
to
others
as
well
as
a
balanced
abv
its
very
likely
to
be
visited
again
many
times
over
o
wonderful
all
around
great
for
a
hot
afternoon
on
the
porch
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
strong
barnyard
flavor
quite
sour
which
remains
long
after
the
swallow
relatively
thin
bodied
highly
carbonated
theres
a
bit
of
light
pepper
on
the
edge
theres
also
a
touch
of
chalk
thyme
and
hop
bitterness
complex
overall
a
very
solid
saison
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
great
beer
for
start
of
summer
oa
nice
archetype
of
a
saison
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
the
dupont
is
drinkable
but
complex
enough
to
hold
your
interest
overall
a
good
saison
but
not
a
killer
the
beer
pours
a
hay
color
the
body
is
murky
underneath
a
huge
white
head
the
smell
is
strong
and
lovely
its
fruity
and
malty
and
warm
man
am
i
glad
i
waited
til
a
warm
summer
evening
to
enjoy
this
the
taste
is
fantastic
fruity
and
clear
the
ingredients
coming
together
perfectly
to
give
the
experience
of
being
outdoors
during
summer
there
isnt
much
mouthfeel
to
speak
of
because
the
beer
is
so
light
overall
this
beer
was
horribly
skunked
and
i
have
a
feeling
it
has
seen
too
much
light
in
its
short
life
bottled
22011
the
skunk
has
overpowered
many
of
the
qualities
that
are
hiding
underneath
i
cant
see
spending
10
plus
for
a
bottle
of
defective
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
with
moderate
retention
smells
of
earthy
spicy
and
funky
lemony
and
fruity
with
a
carbonic
acid
thing
going
on
the
flavor
is
complex
with
pepper
and
earth
and
tart
lemony
fruit
and
light
sweet
non
descript
fruit
medium
to
light
body
with
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
nice
light
refreshing
fruity
and
tart
ale
i
can
see
where
this
is
considered
a
benchmark
of
the
style
the
bold
spiciness
and
strong
floral
character
throughout
certainly
sets
it
apart
as
a
style
in
and
of
itself
within
the
realm
of
belgian
ales
at
the
very
least
saison
dupont
seems
to
stand
as
a
base
example
from
which
variations
and
embellishments
and
experiments
could
spring
forth
t
mix
of
spice
cloves
and
belgian
yeast
up
front
with
a
touch
of
bready
malt
sweetness
and
some
floral
notes
rounding
out
the
palate
a
long
dry
finish
well
balanced
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
pillow
head
that
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
stella
artois
commercials
scent
is
grassy
with
citrus
hints
and
an
overall
earthy
smell
taste
is
refreshing
full
of
flavor
and
delicious
that
ends
with
a
drycrisp
finish
a
fantastically
made
farmhouse
ale
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
cant
imagine
ever
buying
it
again
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
pours
cloudy
pale
yellow
dirty
blondish
fizzy
white
foam
heavy
foam
settles
slow
funky
yeasty
smell
earthy
taste
is
clean
citrussy
very
very
dry
light
finish
fades
into
a
mild
hop
close
light
and
easy
excellent
a
true
classic
that
took
me
long
enough
to
review
compare
all
saison
to
this
i
would
have
to
say
the
tap
was
missing
slight
skunk
the
bottles
can
have
o
the
musty
funk
adds
a
delicate
twang
to
this
beer
very
complex
well
integrated
nothing
dominates
pours
a
hazy
yellow
that
is
slightly
deeper
than
expected
with
a
huge
white
head
that
leaves
some
solid
lacing
nose
is
lighter
than
expected
with
pepper
and
wheat
being
predominant
taste
is
in
the
same
vein
though
a
buttery
slickness
comes
through
too
which
negatively
affects
the
mouthfeel
strong
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
for
a
beer
i
have
heard
so
much
about
and
in
the
midst
of
saison
tasting
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
nice
though
not
great
and
i
dare
say
i
preferred
3
monts
over
this
just
an
all
around
delightful
brew
and
a
great
showcase
of
the
style
refreshing
as
all
get
out
o
highly
recommended
this
is
on
the
top
of
my
short
list
for
summer
beers
and
its
easy
availability
makes
it
even
better
cheers
overall
a
very
good
saison
and
a
true
classic
beer
presents
awesomely
in
the
750ml
corked
bottle
lovely
pale
colour
with
spritey
carbonation
nice
flakes
of
yeast
floating
around
nose
is
divine
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
pure
freshness
on
the
tongue
i
get
dryness
apple
skins
lemon
zest
prickly
champagnelike
carbonbation
on
the
tongue
not
hugely
complex
but
doesnt
need
to
be
one
of
those
archetypical
beers
that
one
cant
consider
the
style
without
including
this
beer
up
there
with
fantome
o
a
really
delicious
and
incredibly
drinkable
saison
extremely
refreshing
and
beautifully
balanced
a
classic
but
not
my
favorite
saison
oa
crisp
and
refreshing
saison
with
good
flavor
and
balance
i
loved
this
beer
all
the
way
around
a
classic
and
one
i
wont
pass
up
again
o
a
really
nice
refreshing
beer
good
session
beer
as
well
very
enjoyable
and
will
seek
out
again
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
good
amount
of
skunkyness
in
it
with
some
wheat
and
grain
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
unfortunately
the
same
this
is
yet
another
skunked
saison
dupont
this
is
the
third
separate
bottle
i
have
purchased
in
an
attempt
to
rate
this
beer
fairly
but
after
wasting
25
on
skunked
beers
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
the
brewer
is
dumb
enough
to
put
a
beer
in
a
green
bottle
they
deserve
a
horrible
rating
if
the
beer
is
skunked
other
than
the
skunked
notes
there
is
a
little
citrus
and
spice
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
gross
yet
i
cant
say
unexpected
beer
shame
on
me
for
buying
bottles
three
times
originally
reviewed
05102011
a
wonderfully
priced
super
refreshing
saison
with
a
classic
background
really
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
something
thats
going
into
my
regular
rotation
being
a
saison
lover
the
scary
part
is
that
its
drinkable
way
too
drinkable
overall
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
with
the
flavours
of
this
brew
but
they
werent
bad
by
any
means
this
beer
is
incredibly
balanced
and
the
whole
thing
develops
as
it
gets
closer
to
room
temperature
o
surprising
to
me
i
felt
it
was
a
middle
of
the
road
example
of
the
style
im
curious
if
it
not
being
bottled
and
having
the
sediment
of
yeast
has
a
tangible
affect
ill
pass
on
this
one
medium
bodied
with
a
big
sharp
effervescence
and
some
drying
a
goodly
amount
of
stickiness
develops
on
both
the
tongue
and
upper
palate
a
good
amount
of
warming
from
the
6
5
abv
a
very
good
beer
for
sure
overall
3
5
good
but
certainly
not
world
class
i
have
to
admit
that
the
skunkiness
factors
into
this
and
why
not
should
i
give
the
beer
makers
at
brasserie
dupont
a
break
on
their
idiotic
decision
to
internationally
distribute
a
very
expensive
beer
in
a
giant
green
bottle
i
dont
think
so
good
beer
probably
would
be
better
without
the
green
bottle
and
unless
i
can
find
one
that
is
not
in
a
green
bottle
i
will
not
be
buying
it
again
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
strong
in
this
but
almost
undetectable
underneath
everything
else
that
was
going
on
while
this
style
of
beer
isnt
quite
for
the
novice
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
this
style
ought
to
seek
out
and
enjoy
this
as
soon
as
possible
its
a
textbook
example
of
the
style
and
worth
the
sight
and
sensory
experience
o
this
is
generally
considered
among
the
signature
widely
available
saisons
and
for
good
reason
my
only
gripe
with
it
is
that
its
dryness
prevents
it
from
being
that
ideal
thirstquenching
choice
which
is
what
a
farmhouse
ale
always
strikes
me
as
needing
but
its
a
trivial
ding
as
overall
this
is
a
finely
made
saison
this
is
a
bad
mutha
and
its
even
more
awesome
not
having
to
deal
with
green
bottles
pours
a
translucent
golden
color
with
a
generous
frothy
white
head
the
zesty
aroma
of
coriander
and
mild
citrus
comprise
a
light
and
invigorating
bouquet
vigorous
carbonation
accentuates
a
spiced
flavor
that
matches
the
aroma
belgian
yeast
character
asserts
itself
up
front
theres
some
citrus
and
banana
but
theyre
wellcontrolled
and
not
cloying
as
is
sometimes
the
case
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
giving
the
palette
ample
opportunity
to
reset
between
sips
a
nebulous
mild
barnyard
funk
manifests
itself
as
the
glass
warms
adding
a
touch
of
complexity
a
hint
of
pepper
is
lurking
somewhere
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
saison
welldeserving
of
the
stellar
reputation
that
preceded
it
impossible
to
turn
down
on
a
warm
summers
day
moreys
bottom
line
it
had
been
a
while
since
id
had
this
and
its
even
better
than
i
remembered
its
sour
funky
fruity
and
most
of
all
refreshing
definitely
a
top
example
within
the
style
and
well
worth
the
8
99
that
i
shelled
out
for
this
bottle
taste
lemony
citrus
character
really
comes
through
here
after
i
was
unable
to
detect
it
at
all
in
the
nose
a
pleasant
surprise
dry
grainy
finish
mediumfull
bodied
with
spry
effervescent
carbonation
dancing
across
your
tongue
an
excellent
farmhouse
ale
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
will
have
again
o
good
summer
patio
beer
that
would
go
well
with
sunshine
summer
tunes
and
barbqued
wild
salmon
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
d
a
poor
beer
too
musty
and
hold
tasting
would
never
get
this
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
light
crispness
and
the
full
flavoring
to
the
taste
this
is
an
exemplary
saison
with
very
fresh
and
clean
malts
perfectly
balancing
the
booze
with
bitterness
ultimately
predominating
throughout
all
aspects
the
beer
fits
the
style
without
becoming
overwhelming
at
any
point
also
had
draught
version
one
day
earlier
which
was
more
flavorful
with
deeper
character
the
best
version
of
this
beer
is
clearly
via
draught
with
the
bottled
version
is
a
distant
third
place
long
lasting
head
hazy
pilsner
malty
bitter
peppery
touch
of
clove
phenolic
aroma
and
some
flavor
tasty
but
slight
brett
flavors
lean
toward
peppersandpaper
rather
than
refreshing
slightly
sourness
full
bodied
yet
pretty
dry
for
this
alcohol
level
dangerously
drinkable
but
im
a
bit
disappointed
after
seeing
scores
well
above
90
overall
a
wonderful
saison
and
the
one
that
most
likely
comes
closest
to
the
ideal
in
terms
of
style
definitely
one
i
would
enjoy
again
throughout
the
summer
overall
the
taste
left
me
wanting
more
the
smell
set
the
stage
for
something
spectacular
and
it
just
wasnt
all
there
it
was
very
good
but
i
smelled
something
great
my
beagle
came
trotting
out
of
the
other
room
looking
for
where
the
smell
was
coming
from
i
could
open
this
and
just
smell
it
ill
be
buying
some
more
and
let
it
set
for
a
while
o
a
very
complex
beer
that
every
sip
can
impart
different
tastes
as
it
warms
finish
is
long
and
has
a
bit
of
grasseness
to
it
great
spring
time
beer
o
if
somebody
didnt
tell
me
what
this
was
i
would
figure
it
a
typical
lowlevel
european
lager
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
to
me
and
i
pick
up
nothing
from
the
brett
ive
heard
about
in
this
beer
except
maybe
the
head
really
a
huge
disappointment
and
definitely
not
worth
the
12
for
the
750ml
really
great
saison
definitely
recommended
as
as
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
to
refresh
but
that
also
has
a
complex
edge
to
it
definitely
try
it
if
you
are
new
to
saisons
as
this
will
make
you
want
to
try
more
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
saison
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
the
light
to
medium
body
allows
a
good
amount
of
flavor
to
come
through
while
remaining
refreshing
the
carbonation
fizzes
up
quite
a
bit
when
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
and
gets
rather
foamy
in
the
swallow
a
truly
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
straddles
the
border
between
sipper
and
clean
easy
drinker
just
a
hint
of
something
wild
in
the
yeast
department
brings
me
coming
back
for
sip
after
sip
very
nice
poured
a
massive
3
white
velvet
head
with
extremely
long
life
and
big
merengue
floaters
the
body
is
a
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
color
with
a
faint
glow
it
smells
mildly
of
grass
and
grain
taste
is
delightful
with
citrus
grapefruit
grass
grain
and
a
slow
to
reveal
but
long
burn
from
a
hops
finish
theres
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
kind
of
like
perrier
a
class
act
of
a
beer
big
nose
a
very
enjoyable
experience
o
the
best
saison
ive
had
everything
about
this
beer
was
enjoyable
its
highly
drinkable
refreshing
and
tasty
i
look
forward
to
pairing
this
with
some
salmon
o
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
truly
a
classic
example
of
the
style
great
flavor
smell
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
over
and
over
and
never
tire
of
i
think
i
will
have
to
go
replenish
my
supply
soon
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
pairs
great
with
meals
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
stemmed
vase
the
beer
is
a
hazy
opaque
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
thick
foamy
small
bubbled
bright
white
head
about
a
half
an
inch
thick
aromas
are
yeasty
with
hints
of
clove
and
floral
highlights
very
light
and
spicy
on
the
nose
flavors
are
very
spiced
with
a
solid
clove
profile
along
a
citrus
and
bready
blended
foundation
some
lavendar
and
juniper
highlights
throughout
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
extremely
complex
at
the
same
time
very
good
challenge
to
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
clove
spiced
and
toasty
and
the
light
body
leaves
a
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
finish
is
slightly
lingering
but
light
and
spicy
good
brew
it
pours
a
nice
light
yellow
with
a
perfect
white
head
laces
nicely
in
a
glass
plenty
of
big
citrusy
dry
notes
in
the
nose
then
you
take
that
first
sip
wow
super
yeasty
crisp
and
dry
flavor
and
a
nice
finish
a
worldclass
superbeer
overall
very
easy
drinking
some
minor
funk
and
a
delicate
hand
make
this
extremely
approachable
it
hits
all
the
right
characteristics
for
the
style
incredibly
clean
and
light
o
first
go
at
this
saison
and
very
pleased
i
went
from
a
boozy
saison
to
this
refreshing
goodness
would
suggest
to
anyone
and
will
have
again

with
less

good
though

enjoyed
the
brew
but

again
soon
missed
the
funk
too
much
o
love
it
the
classic
saison
and
for
a
reason
easy
to
put
away
but
complex
enough
to
make
you
think
about
the
flavors
taste
is
the
same
very
nuanced
subtle
and
yeastforward
with
a
funky
and
barely
bitter
leave
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
pillowy
lightweight
bubbly
as

but
soft
completely
devoid
of
the
soda

with

the

to
it
with

that
left
a

the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
some
sweet
fresh
grains

hints
of
wild
flowers
and
honey
the
taste
was
on
the
sweet
side
as
well
and
made
this

in

the
flavors
come
to

as
the

warms

5excellent
for
the
style
this
is
a
wonderful
saison
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
such
a
traditional
take
on
the
style
like
nearly
every
other
saison
ive
had
upfront
and
good
body
and
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
especially
on
a
warm
summer
day
overall
but
better
things
have
been
done
with
the
style
maybe
its
different
out
of
a
bottle
o
a
great
great
saison
o
a
complex
beer
add
more
funk
and
sour
and
this
would
remind
me
of
the
oude
gueze
i
had
recently
looking
forward
to
more
saisons
this
is
worth
a
try
and
will
have
again
o
great
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
late
day
sun
yellow
with
nice
fluffy
white
head
some
sedimentation
perhaps
from
the
pour
job
smell
and
flavour
are
much
the
same
lots
of
fruits
banana
green
apple
some
white
grape
and
strongest
of
all
lemon
rind
both
nose
and
palate
some
background
clove
spices
and
pepper
along
with
unmistakable
yeast
no
surprise
there
nice
and
light
crisp
refreshing
overall
a
good
beer
especially
in
the
summer
nice
well
done
goes
well
with
a
moldy
tallegio
and
hard
bread
awesome
one
of
the
classic
beers
of
this
style
for
good
reason
highly
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
and
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
as
it
is
simple
with
enough
subtle
yeast
complexity
to
make
it
worth
coming
back
to
overall
i
consider
this
beer
quintessential
for
the
style
nothing
overdone
and
with
everything
in
its
place
worth
a
shot
overall
drinkability
when
i
first
poured
this
and
only
got
a
lot
of
foam
i
wasnt
sure
since
the
only
tastes
i
was
getting
were
a
few
drops
of
sour
citrus
but
once
the
beer
settled
down
a
bit
and
i
could
catch
everything
i
can
see
why
people
rave
about
this
style
definitely
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
spring
evening
and
it
would
work
really
well
in
the
summer
i
feel
though
that
i
need
to
have
it
with
food
though
by
itself
its
good
but
i
keep
wanting
something
to
eat
with
it
definitely
a
sipping
and
savoring
beer
despite
its
warm
weather
quenching
quality
definitely
a
good
beer
that
ill
have
to
revisit
sometime
overall
a
nice
light
and
easy
to
drink
saison
the
green
bottle
has
got
to
go
most
of
the
skunkiness
faded
after
a
while
but
just
enough
lingered
to
throw
the
flavor
off
a
bit
minus
the
green
bottle
this
beer
would
be
awesome
and
very
reliable
drinkability
very
refereshing
and
enjoyable
this
is
an
awesome
beer
not
quite
fantome
but
widely
available
other
than
that
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
at
the
end
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
glass
i
should
continue
the
great
history
of
this
beer
by
buying
another
bottle
soon
reviewed
from
notes
750ml
bottle
split
with
buddies
so
often
i
get
light
struck
bottles
of
this
thank
goodness
this
wasnt
one
perfect
stram
yellow
just
oh
so
hazy
tiny
bubbles
cruise
to
the
top
of
the
glass
under
a
dense
whipped
cream
head
sheets
upon
sheets
of
lacing
cascade
down
the
glass
spicy
zesty
and
peppery
aroma
just
a
hint
of
farmhouse
simple
and
well
presented
flavors
here
backed
by
a
basic
malt
bill
of
pils
grassy
noble
hops
make
there
presence
known
and
then
that
great
yeast
spicey
and
earthy
with
highlights
of
citrus
and
coriander
real
well
attenuated
dry
when
one
gets
a
good
bottle
of
dupont
there
really
isnt
much
better
very
good
farmhouse
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
would
definitely
seek
out
again
jumping
right
back
into
the
saisons
with
one
of
the
most
wellknown
examples
of
the
style
in
saison
dupont
750
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
light
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
forms
quickly
and
dissipates
almost
as
fast
i
get
a
lot
of
sour
tartness
in
the
nose
with
a
white
grape
funkiness
going
on
along
with
some
slight
skunkiness
this
one
has
been
in
my
fridge
since
purchase
but
i
get
this
earthy
basement
smell
out
of
it
first
taste
takes
me
by
surprise
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
dry
with
a
good
almost
sour
bitterness
taste
is
light
and
lemony
with
some
earthy
hops
giving
it
a
nice
musky
feel
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
i
get
this
pepper
sweet
almost
green
pepper
note
this
thing
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
day
its
not
sweet
like
other
saisons
can
be
and
the
bone
dry
finish
literally
makes
the
mouth
water
overall
a
very
nice
saison
and
one
i
wont
be
afraid
to
reach
for
in
the
future
o
while
this
beer
isnt
offensive
in
any
way
its
completely
lacking
in
flavor
which
makes
it
hard
to
believe
its
worthy
of
the
high
score
its
received
that
leads
me
to
question
whether
theres
something
wrong
besides
a
little
skunk
with
this
bottle
and
for
attempt
number
two
at
purchasing
bottles
neither
the
dtrain
or
i
will
every
be
buying
one
again
for
a
rereview
m
very
refreshing
clean
and
fresh
flavours
which
goes
over
to
a
quite
dry
aftertaste
highly
drinkable
and
a
perfect
summer
ale
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
monk
what
a
unique
beer
cloudy
greengolden
color
with
a
huge
lacy
head
that
just
doesnt
quit
smells
like
a
farm
tastes
like
a
farm
grassyherbal
notes
all
over
the
place
with
a
little
bit
of
sour
and
malt
in
the
background
very
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
felt
like
a
took
a
trip
on
a
tractor
with
this
one
the
quintessential
saison
a
masterful
example
of
the
style
tart
funky
yet
well
balanced
complex
enough
for
the
connoisseur
but
still
approachable
for
the
novice
while
there
are
a
few
saisons
i
personally
prefer
to
this
one
i
cant
deny
duponts
flagship
ale
remains
a
bellwether
msuper
dry
makes
my
cheeks
pucker
and
my
tongue
tingle
mouthfeel
is
full
despite
the
lackluster
malt
profile
higher
carbonation
but
appropriate
for
the
style
this
is
not
the
most
flavorful
saison
in
existence
but
it
is
true
to
style
this
is
just
too
boring
for
my
liking
overall
i
can
appreciate
how
its
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
but
the
traditional
style
is
lackluster
for
my
taste
over
all
the
beer
is
good
one
of
my
first
saisons
so
maybe
i
was
expecting
something
more
i
think
i
may
have
imbibed
it
too
cold
definitely
warm
up
to
cellar
temperatures
before
drinking
this
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
o
overall
this
was
a
terrible
use
of
8
if
it
was
cheaper
the
overall
score
would
be
better
this
beer
is
just
nothing
special
imo
will
not
get
again
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
cloudy
with
a
white
head
lots
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
mostly
a
musty
moldlike
that
kind
of
follow
with
the
taste
just
a
bit
of
malt
it
has
a
drymedium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
crisp
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
but
would
have
like
to
capture
more
layers
of
flavor
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
a
bit
peppery
and
overall
this
is
a
great
verison
of
the
style
and
a
must
have
for
those
seeking
a
saison
if
a
fantome
is
not
able
to
be
found
o
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
ive
had
it
on
tap
a
couple
times
this
was
my
first
out
of
the
bottle
very
good
goto
saison
overall
this
is
the
saison
that
all
others
are
measured
enough
said
a
darn
fine
saison
if
you
ask
me
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
plan
to
buy
it
again
this
yeasty
brew
goes
great
with
strong
cheeses
and
stands
up
to
spicy
charcuterie
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
beer
would
be
like
if
it
were
available
fresh
either
from
a
keg
or
for
gods
sake
even
in
a
dark
bottle
d
i
really
dig
the
dryness
of
this
saison
and
certainly
will
come
back
to
it
if
im
in
the
mood
for
that
particular
aspect
again
drinkability
this
is
the
second
saison
i
have
tried
and
it
has
without
a
doubt
redeemed
the
style
for
me
personally
though
i
would
much
prefer
hefe
or
wit
the
muskiness
turns
me
off
a
little
drinkability
the
ultimate
summer
beer
light
bodied
complex
but
easy
to
mentally
digest
this
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
saisons
that
i
have
encountered
definitely
a
leader
of
its
category
and
a
saison
to
judge
all
others
by
perfect
in
my
book
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
and
would
definitely
consider
picking
it
up
again
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
slight
off
note
that
is
easily
dismissed
due
to
the
poor
choice
in
bottle
would
love
to
get
this
beer
boxed
freshed
and
store
cellar
a
case
over
a
year
d
an
excellent
saison
probably
the
best
in
the
world
a
truly
excellent
beer
d
very
drinkable
fresh
fruity
slightly
musky
an
excellent
if
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
drinkabilty
very
nice
beer
one
of
the
best
styles
of
farmhouse
you
can
find
smooth
and
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
is
only
6
5
so
yes
drink
up
and
enjoy
this
world
class
beer
d
i
wish
i
could
taste
more
in
this
beer
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
good
for
refreshment
but
not
much
else
disappointed
the
beer
is
a
light
gold
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
bananas
spices
belgian
yeast
light
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
full
of
spice
and
belgian
yeast
with
a
background
of
bananas
the
malt
character
is
thin
and
theres
a
mild
but
complimentary
hops
presence
the
aftertaste
is
spicy
and
slightly
sweet
crisp
and
very
smooth
medium
body
medium
carbonation
very
clean
finish
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
especially
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
cpj
d
the
saison
of
choice
for
me
this
is
the
epitome
of
the
style
and
should
be
had
before
sampling
any
of
the
domestic
versions
overall
this
beer
is
a
must
for
anyone
who
loves
saisons
and
the
beer
is
a
classic
i
could
do
without
the
green
bottle
or
maybe
get
a
bottled
on
date
somewhere
on
the
bottle
but
i
cant
complain
this
is
a
finely
crafted
beer
and
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
cheers
d
pretty
high
one
of
the
all
time
best
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
no
problem
it
is
light
yet
still
complex
and
very
tasty
i
loved
this
and
will
be
back
to
good
foods
market
in
lexington
ky
for
more
d
a
moderately
enjoyable
beer
but
the
balance
here
is
too
much
in
favor
of
this
particular
yeasty
flavor
for
me
to
be
really
excited
about
having
another
one
soon
it
is
a
sturdy
beer
with
a
definite
taste
that
you
do
not
have
to
guess
on
it
smells
and
tastes
quite
bitter
but
if
you
take
the
time
to
enjoy
it
you
will
however
if
bitterness
is
not
your
thing
then
this
may
be
too
much
bite
it
had
a
great
gold
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
head
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
strong
hefeweizen
it
would
be
great
to
have
one
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
7
of
these
when
i
wake
up
on
a
monday
morning
overall
i
really
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
nice
four
year
vintage
really
helped
this
and
if
it
was
ever
really
sour
it
has
been
significantly
mellowed
with
time
and
the
overall
balance
of
it
was
really
just
quite
nice
i
was
glad
there
were
two
on
the
shelf
as
this
has
held
up
very
nicely
and
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
have
it
again
d
i
have
no
problem
killing
this
bottle
the
aroma
is
inverted
for
the
taste
as
the
citrus
is
quick
ignored
for
the
grassfunk
in
the
beers
finish
this
is
an
exceptionally
easy
drinker
and
one
thatd
be
great
outdoors
in
the
summer
very
drinkable
even
with
the
high
level
of
carbonation
not
too
sweet
and
no
notice
of
alcohol
best
saison
ive
ever
had
t
some
nice
funk
lemon
citrus
and
a
light
sour
finish
probably
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
overall
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
an
awesome
example
of
the
style
nicely
balanced
light
and
refreshing
while
not
lacking
in
flavor
or
complexity
great
the
bottles
of
this
always
open
with
an
enormous
bang
and
the
carbonation
produces
such
an
enormous
thick
white
head
that
it
always
amazes
me
how
pleasant
the
champagne
like
carbonation
is
to
the
palate
the
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
blonde
and
that
huge
head
of
course
leaves
a
beautiful
lace
the
aroma
has
just
the
nicest
hint
of
funk
along
with
some
very
earthy
fruity
and
yeasty
aromas
everything
is
just
in
its
right
place
with
the
beer
and
you
can
really
tell
that
this
recipe
has
been
perfected
over
a
considerable
amount
of
time
this
is
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
refined
beer
because
it
very
much
is
not
but
this
rustic
nature
is
part
of
the
great
harmony
of
this
brew
the
flavor
is
at
once
dry
and
funky
followed
by
pronounced
fruitiness
of
apples
and
some
citrus
there
are
certainly
bubblegum
notes
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
we
are
dealing
with
anything
cloyingly
sweet
oh
and
it
is
hoppy
too
the
spiciness
of
the
hops
albeit
is
not
the
dominant
flavor
but
lends
well
to
the
harmony
of
the
dry
and
fruity
flavors
this
is
fantastic
reminds
me
of
a
refined
version
of
hennepin
as
much
as
i
love
hennepin
as
found
by
my
hennepin
glasses
in
my
collection
this
one
is
better
not
by
much
but
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
ill
buy
more
of
this
one
for
sure
not
very
familiar
with
saison
style
beers
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
earthy
spicy
characteristics
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
and
would
suggest
to
anyone
interested
in
belgian
beer
serving
type
bottle
d
great
flavor
and
a
super
smooth
profile
the
carbonation
is
refreshing
and
the
body
doesnt
force
you
to
do
too
much
heavy
lifting
oh
god
so
many
spirits
to
become
such
mountains
to
ascend
i
am
young
remember
that
you
devils
i
am
young
but
you
will
not
take
me
now
i
have
many
more
saisons
to
drink
and
i
have
yet
to
see
the
alps
overall
this
beer
blew
away
my
expectations
and
really
makes
me
want
to
get
a
few
more
saisons
under
my
belt
however
out
of
the
10
or
so
that
ive
tried
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
fantastic
again
a
very
dry
brew
but
refreshing
at
the
same
time
and
im
very
pleased
to
have
tried
this
brew
watch
out
the
6
5
abv
is
hidden
really
well
tho
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
in
a
glass
you
start
to
get
a
sense
for
the
relatively
high
abv
good
stuff
here
id
buy
this
again
and
share
it
with
any
one
who
appreciates
good
brews
in
that
sense
its
a
little
hard
to
guage
this
beer
i
think
that
to
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
im
really
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
more
funky
earthy
saisons
as
i
find
myself
enjoying
cleaner
takes
on
the
stylehennepin
saison
de
buff
for
examples
sake
so
id
say
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
of
saison
or
beers
with
a
lot
of
funk
notes
go
for
it
if
youre
not
this
beer
is
not
going
to
change
your
mind
i
can
see
how
its
currently
the
seventh
ranked
saison
on
beeradvocate
its
subtle
crisp
and
would
be
even
more
of
a
joy
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
components
a
solid
and
you
can
enjoy
it
but
it
is
hard
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
head
that
doesnt
linger
very
long
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
the
taste
mirrors
this
the
taste
is
of
bubblegum
and
fruity
notes
with
little
to
no
hoppy
notes
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
it
finishes
clean
this
would
be
a
great
beer
in
the
summertime
d
very
refreshing
ive
seen
better
mainly
from
fantome
i
still
cant
deny
this
being
a
solid
very
drinkable
brew
i
find
the
score
for
this
beer
entirely
inexplicable
straw
colored
pour
with
some
sediment
and
a
gigantic
rocky
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
floral
and
delicately
sweet
theres
the
classic
belgian
esters
in
the
nose
which
lend
light
notes
of
banana
bubblegum
and
clove
but
also
a
hint
of
phenol
that
adds
a
peppery
note
i
get
some
faint
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
along
with
a
soft
wheaty
malt
the
flavor
is
as
equally
light
and
delicate
as
the
aroma
theres
some
slight
herbal
floral
bitterness
balanced
out
by
hints
of
pepper
cracked
wheat
lemon
banana
and
clove
the
body
has
a
medium
to
thin
mouth
feel
with
loads
of
lively
carbonation
and
a
dry
clean
finish
dreally
superb
beer
with
an
amazing
level
of
drinkability
d
alcohol
its
wisely
balanced
by
bitter
and
fruity
so
this
beer
results
very
drinkable
d
i
cant
even
begin
to
describe
the
drinkability
of
this
guy
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
it
when
the
heat
and
humidity
rear
their
ugly
heads
d
super
drinkable
despite
a
slightly
above
average
abv
stays
super
smooth
very
balanced
taste
and
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
smooth
excellent
beer
m
slight
graininess
from
yeast
drinkability
quaffable
a
good
saison
though
i
would
still
pick
up
any
of
the
jp
varieties
over
this
a
lovely
lulling
standard
bearer
for
the
style
something
one
just
has
to
experience
as
im
sure
i
havent
done
it
justice
via
this
description
this
shows
all
those
upstarts
how
its
done
how
a
steady
touch
can
deftly
balance
all
of
the
subtle
intermingling
flavours
i
am
blown
away
every
time
i
have
this
one
benchmark
awesome
slight
haze
to
the
burnt
gold
color
white
head
that
holds
forever
and
leaves
beautiful
lace

is
shining
pure
clean
bready
pilsner
malt
earthy
floral
herbal
hops
citrus
spice
grass
lemongrass
and
a
funky
but
subdued
skunkypot
kind
of
thing
taste
is
a
superbly
balanced
melange
of
all
of
the
above
with
a
dry
and
peppery
finish
fluffy
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
tingleprickle
to
zip
it
up
and
add
a
bit
of
a
refreshing
quality
this
would
be
one
of
my
desert
island
beers
awesome
a
timeless
classic
for
real
i
never
get
sick
of
this
beer
i
was
able
to
try
this
at
a
local
liquor
store
and
was
hooked
on
this
saison
ever
since
the
saison
pours
well
with
a
good
size
head
has
the
cloudy
unfiltered
look
you
expect
to
find
the
color
is
a
nice
golden
color
overall
its
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
flavor
starts
with
a
creamy
malt
then
a
slight
spicy
tang
very
crisp
and
dry
soft
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
similar
to
champagne
appearance
is
a
golden
cloudy
yellow
with
a
darker
yellow
core
head
is
white
and
rocky
that
reveals
a
nice
lacing
as
it
disipates
smells
nutty
yeasty
with
citrus
undertones
tastes
dry
sour
and
nutty
with
a
nice
honey
filled
grassy
earthy
character
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
light
with
a
champagne
quality
this
is
my
favorite
saison
yet
very
tastey
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
as
soon
as
i
can
afford
another
bottle
o
o
saison
dupont
is
a
beer
that
i
will
keep
enjoying
over
time
it
is
so
flavorful
and
refreshing
and
is
a
standout
example
of
the
style
d
i
know
this
is
typically
a
summer
brew
but
throwing
one
down
during
the
first
winter
snow
wasnt
the
worst
idea
ive
ever
had
my
first
saison
750ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
lasting
head
lively
carbonation
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
very
complex
of
spicy
hops
biscuit
malt
sweet
fruit
and
citrus
full
body
very
tangy
mouthfeel
peppery
hops
on
the
palate
are
balanced
by
biscuit
malt
and
sweet
fruit
with
hints
of
citrus
finish
is
long
and
complex
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
awhile
why
oh
why
did
i
buy
the
small
bottle
instead
of
the
750
this
beers
balance
and
complexity
make
it
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beverages
around
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
want
to
have
this
after
a
long
hot
day
working
on
the
farm
golden
straw
color
with
good
haze
clean
white
thick
1
head
at
pour
settling
to
a
even
18
cover
very
light
belgian
spice
with
just
a
touch
of
pepper
to
aroma
pick
up
some
faint
lemon
high
fuzzy
carbonation
making
for
a
ver
crisp
finish
on
the
swallow
tingles
the
toungue
makes
for
some
nice

very
clean

and
refreshing

light
malty

with
lemon
in
aftertaste
very
well
done
i
like
the
carbonation
left
on
the
back
of
the
tougue
at
the
end
slight
dryness
on
the
finish
with
pale
citrus
peel
feel
feeling
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
light
and
tart
could
have
a
bit
of
a
peppery
effect
not
really
picking
up
on
the
big
sour
that
some
get
but
a
great
example
of
style
seems
simple
enough
while
also
being
complex
very
good
d
i
like
it
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
have
only
had
a
few
saisons
before
but
this
one
seems
classic
and
the
best
how
a
saison
should
be
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
is
deep
gold
in
color
cloudy
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
was
frothy
and
had
great
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
had
a
strong
aroma
of
citrus
coriander
hints
of
grapefruit
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
slightly
sour
to
start
but
evens
off
as
the
hints
of
citrus
fruit
come
forward
finishes
with
a
dry
aftertaste
pretty
true
to
the
saison
style
possibly
a
bit
more
sour
aftertaste
than
most
still
an
excellent
saison
every
aspect
of
this
beer
improved
as
it
warmed
up
outside
the
fridge
for
15
minutes
or
so
murky
dark
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
poured
with

aromas
with
a

of

bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
lots
of
wet
lacings
yeast
orange
and
lemon
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
lead
to
a
spicy
peppery
middle
that
lingers
through
the
yeasty

finish
lots
of
character
and
easy
to
drink

the
bubbly

entered

a
tall
lively

spicy
fruits
with
a
little
puckering

if
i
was
disappointed
that
the
pub
was
out
of
the
fantome
i
had
ordered
that
disappointment
quickly
faded
as
i
took
my
first
sip
of
this
very
drinkable
and
quite
affordable
brew
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavors
are
fairly
complex
but
very
well
balanced
the
beer
overall
is
super
smooth
and
refreshing

a
very
nice
saison
that
is
worth
the
attention
it
gets

a
hint
of
acidity
but
very
easy
to
drink
it
perceives
a
pure
hops
season
which
gives
a
bitter
taste
and
pungent
taste
and
a
final
subtle
grapefruit
being
a
bit
like
lemonade
the
attack
is
frank
yet
refreshing
with
a
fruity
controlled
bitterness
and
a
very
convincing
finish
long
and
dry
it
remains
a
standard
season
but
extremely
well
controlled
and
mostly
so
easy
to
drink
maltiness
is
the
first
thing
that
greeted
me
followed
quickly
by
some
tart
citrus
kinds
of
character
and
some
other
spicy
phenols
it
finished
with
a
very
dry
cracker
finish
that
flowed
into
a
surprisingly
bitter
aftertaste
really
a
nice
complex
beer
that
was
also
remarkably
balanced
for
how
complex
it
was
well
done
d
a
decent
saison
saison
dupont
has
light
enjoyable
flavors
that
make
it
refreshing
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
bet
this
would
pair
nicely
with
some
apple
pie
corked
popped
off
and
almost
dented
my
ceiling
cork
says
2
008
poured
a
lively
cloudy
yellow
straw
color
with
amazing
carbonation
super
bubbly
almost
champange
like
head
was
huge
and
i
had
to
stop
pouring
or
it
would
have
overflowed
quickly
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
brew
and
it
is
exceptional
aroma
of
orange
lemon
citrus
grass
fruit
taste
is
balanced
citrus
fruit
and
yeast
dry
finish
mediumthin
body
light
and
refreshing
super
drinkable
overall
get
some
no
regrets
good
price
very
drinkable
beer
though
not
a
sessionable
beer
at
6
5
it
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
just
as
this
class
of
beers
was
originally
created
to
enjoy
at
the
end
of
a
long
days
work
drinkability
tasty
and
interesting
but
not
a
session
beer
best
enjoyed
after
a
hard
days
work
this
is
one
of
the
classic
saisons
of
the
world
and
it
is
tasting
very
nice
from
the
present
bottle
in
the
past
i
may
have
had
some
skunked
bottles
that
have
tasted
much
more
bitter
this
is
light
fruity
and
just
delicious
in
short
a
light
refreshing
brew
seeking
balance
between
citrusy
tartness
hoppy
bitterness
and
spiciness
very
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
delicious
had
this
on
tap
at
monks
in
philadelphia
showed
a
light
yellow
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
earthy
and
grassy
sweet
medium
carbonation
very
grassy
up
front
sweet
and
fruity
from
the
yeast
dry
finish
great
beer
incredibly
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
my
first
try
was
extremely
dull
im
relieved
that
i
received
a
good
bottle
alcohol
level
is
reasonable
and
the
beer
is
interesting
and
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
if
you
could
get
your
hands
on
several
this
was
more
like
a
white
wine
to
me
than
a
beer
still
very
tasty
however
im
not
crazy
about
it
being
in
a
green
bottle
picked
up
a
750ml
as
a
treat
popped
the
cork
and
this
was
almost
like
opening
a
bottle
of
champagne
poured
into
a
chimay
goblet
it
pours
a
golden
orange
with
an
amazing
white
head
incredible
floral
aroma
with
classic
farmhouse
funk
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
especially
with
a
great
meal
it
is
amazing
in
everyway
however
it
was
smooth
dry
and
nicely
crafted
unfiltered
and
bottle
conditioned
i
am
sure
ill
never
get
this
beer
again
it
is
so
far
from
a
style
i
like
its
not
funny
this
is
pretty
darn
weird
flavored
and
without
the
hops
theres
nothing
to
save
this
beer
thankfully
the
hops
save
things
they
take
a
lot
of
off
putting
flavors
and
somehow
mix
them
together
i
think
i
understand
why
this
beer
is
well
ranked
but
it
just
isnt
for
me
bottom
line
buyer
be
ware
this
isnt
a
beer
for
advanced
pallets
its
a
beer
for
those
that
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
if
youre
not
one
dont
wasnt
your
money
drinkability
could
easily
drink
this
750
ml
by
myself
i
am
sharing
with
a
friend
however
i
should
have
been
greedy
d
awesome
for
the
decent
abv
very
refreshing
and
an
obvious
benchmark
for
the
style
d
i
want
more
complexity
easy
drinking
what
more
can
you
ask
for
d
give
me
more
clean
refreshing
lively
and
yummy
i
want
this
pouring
out
of
sides
of
my
house
for
hot
summer
days
i
love
this
belgian
ale
i
drink
a
lot
of
beers
but
do
not
wind
up
with
saisons
often
enough
due
to
location
i
think
if
had
my
druthers
i
would
keep
kegs
of
this
one
around
for
daily
consumption
masterful
work
of
art
here
in
complexity
and
drinkability
d
i
could
happily
drink
this
all
day
this
beer
has
a
very
rustic
characteristic
to
the
overall
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
even
displays
a
pronounced
funk
that
is
typical
of
an
authentic
farmhouse
ale
its
a
dry
beer
and
carries
a
mouthfeel
which
reminds
me
of
champagne
citrus
with
peel
floral
grass
a
little
vanilla
wheat
and
a
slight
hint
of
stone
gravel
which
keeps
it
dry
its
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
ale
during
the
summer
months
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
towering
white
head
and
incredible
legs
as
it
makes
its
way
down
my
tulip
smell
is
quite
a
bit
of
unrestrained
funk
and
earth
some
floral
character
makes
its
way
in
as
well
quite
complex
and
seems
to
come
from
many
different
angles
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
well
integrated
and
complex
with
some
notes
pushing
a
bit
too
far
ahead
but
still
quite
tasty
well
carbonated
and
beautifully
dry
this
drinks
quite
well
the
epitome
of
the
style
overall
i
use
this
one
as
my
classic
saison
to
compare
everything
else
too
though
everything
else
seems
to
fall
short
of
this
very
well
balanced
not
to
sweet
up
front
not
to
dry
on
the
finish
yet
subtly
complex
great
brew
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
especially
refreshing
initially
i
felt
a
little
underwhelm
by
this
offering
but
as
i
continued
with
the
bottle
the
flavors
grew
on
me
i
found
it
to
be
great
with
food
such
as
pasta
or
chicken
or
salad
drinkability
pretty
good
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
certainly
the
textbook
example
of
a
saison
but
i
didnt
excite
me
or
change
the
way
i
see
the
style
as
the
talk
around
it
would
suggest
great
beer
must
try
but
keep
your
expectations
grounded
a
really
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
or
even
early
fall
day
the
dupont
is
a
very
credible
easy
to
find
saison
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
golden
blonde
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
hangs
around
through
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
quite
complex
more
funk
than
i
anticipated
spicy
mostly
white
pepper
lemongrass
may
be
more
prominent
though
flavor
is
outstanding
changes
throughout
the
bottle
both
as
the
beer
warms
and
as
i
pour
the
last
yeastladen
dregs
into
it
the
glass
just
wonderful
tart
spicy
herbal
and
a
hint
of
lemongrass
finishes
bitter
and
dry
the
most
surprising
aspect
to
me
was
how
creamy
the
first
sip
was
which
i
attribute
to
the
carbonation
just
a
wonderful
beer
that
ill
have
any
time
i
see
it
my
favorite
is
still
saison
derpemere
the
lingering
impression
is
the
softness
and
a
sense
of
wellbalanced
and
subtle
quality
and
drinkability
its
not
a
bold
beer
but
one
which
seduces
you
the
first
sip
is
worth
the
wait
fruity
crisp
herbal
earthy
slightly
tart
dry
not
much
malt
bitter
finish
its
a
very
complex
fullflavoured
and
wellbalanced
beer
some
beers
will
have
a
lot
going
on
as
this
one
does
but
theyll
be
a
mess
all
over
the
place
with
no
cohesion
this
one
pulls
it
off
and
does
so
in
spades
really
really
well
done
probably
all
too
easy
to
drink
even
with
an
abv
of
6
5
thats
completely
hidden
truly
a
great
beer
refreshing
and
so
darn
easy
to
drink
d
probably
the
best
saison
i
have
had
yet
hands
down
pours
slightly
cloudy
bright
yellow
with
a
voluminous
off
white
head
of
tightly
packed
bubbles
the
head
erupts
up
from
the
liquid
to
make
a
beautiful
towering
pillow
of
rocky
foam
and
leaves
beautiful
lace
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
wonderful
fruity
and
funky
with
a
pleasant
graininess
green
apple
pear
citrus
a
perfume
of
floral
and
herbal
aromas
and
white
pepper
all
mingle
in
my
nostrils
the
flavor
seems
to
be
both
delicate
and
robust
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
tart
and
slightly
lactic
attack
that
gives
way
to
a
wonderful
grainy
malt
profile
herbal
hops
and
notes
of
pear
and
citrus
also
mingle
about
in
my
mouth
peppery
spice
and
lemon
grass
are
also
there
and
i
find
it
hard
to
describe
all
the
flavors
as
they
seem
to
transform
as
i
sip
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
mouthfeel
is
full
of
carbonation
it
is
a
bit
tingly
on
the
tongue
but
at
the
same
time
its
also
smooth
super
drinkable
and
super
delicious
the
first
time
i
bought
this
beer
it
was
skunked
and
it
scared
me
away
for
awhile
but
tasting
it
now
i
think
it
is
worth
the
risk
drinkability
is
very
good
given
the
abv
the
dryness
also
helps
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
a
nice
bubbly
medium
weight
feel
in
the
mouth
smooth
and
crisp
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
overall
a
very
enjoyable
summer
saison
that
deserves
to
be
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
this
is
a
really
great
authentic
saison
but
just
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
i
will
definatly
revisit
this
again
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
perfect
pair
for
the
hot
weather
today
i
now
understand
why
this
is
considered
by
many
the
quintessential
saison
very
well
balanced
beer
very
refreshing
and
lives
up
to
its
original
goal
of
being
a
good
summer
beer
the
way
a
sip
of
this
beer
can
cleanse
your
palate
this
would
go
very
well
with
bbq
outstanding
drinkability
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
have
enough
of
this
get
this
if
you
can
you
will
not
regret
it
youll
drink
it
again
and
again
the
aroma
was
fairly
mild
though
after
uncorking
the
bottle
i
caught
a
whiff
and
was
intrigued
vinous
woody
yeast
and
a
hint
of
fruit
though
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
specifics
at
first
taste
i
was
a
little
disappointed
though
reminds
me
of
a
hefe
than
a
saison
although
as
i
said
earlier
my
experience
with
saisons
is
limited
a
little
spiciness
the
usual
funkiness
a
little
fruitiness
though
i
was
expect
more
of
a
hop
profile
dont
get
me
wrong
i
cant
really
find
any
real
faults
with
the
beer
but
im
having
trouble
seeing
the
greatness
in
it
drinkability
tasty
complex
and
refreshing
easy
drinking
comes
in
a
sharing
size
bottle
but
is
just
as
well
a
single
serving
pours
a
very
nice
slightly
orange
but
mostly
yellow
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
and
a
nice
light
amount
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
slight
tinge
of
spunkiness
to
it
bitter
lemon
and
some
spicy
white
pepper
come
through
also
has
a
big
lemony
oily
aroma
that
is
intriguing
realoy
floral
flavors
with
some
rose
pedal
white
asparagus
and
some
pink
peppercorns
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
has
a
nice
bitter
mid
palate
and
subtle
sweetness
on
the
finish
to
balance
out
this
saison
slight
skunky
notes
of
hot
rubber
and
some
bacon
fat
but
still
tasty
these
green
bottles
need
to
go
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
smooth
carbonation
and
crisp
finish
food
friendly
also
drinkability
falls
just
above
average
for
me
because
its
not
the
most
delicious
beer
but
with
the
occasion
and
meal
this
works
sheer
elegance
try
to
make
sure
and
get
a
fresh
one
or
at
least
one
from
the
back
of
the
shelf
as
far
away
from
light
as
possible
i
think
it
can
skunk
a
little
750ml
corked
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
great
appearance
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
massive
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
funky
aroma
with
earth
mustiness
yeast
and
citrus
the
flavor
has
yeast
and
citrus
with
some
spices
and
a
little
earthiness
well
carbonated
fairly
light
body
and
a
dry
finish
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
saison
carbonation
level
is
moderatetohigh
but
this
beer
doesnt
feel
harsh
in
any
way
the
finish
is
actually
quite
mellow
and
smooth
i
notice
some
white
pepper
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
tart
yeast
slightly
puckering
fruits
and
mild
wood
notes
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
great
saison
took
me
much
too
long
to
try
this
one
great
beer
drinkability
i
really
like
saisons
and
i
really
like
this
saison
as
i
had
heard
this
is
the
benchmark
of
the
style
i
cannot
believe
i
put
off
buying
this
beer
for
so
long
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
well
balanced
combination
of
tartness
and
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
drink
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
light
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
in
the
aroma
lemon
zest
and
yeasty
in
the
taste
dry
yeastiness
and
lemon
zest
with
a
sweeter
barnyard
like
earthiness
a
smooth
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
lemon
yeastiness
to
a
clean
aftertaste
clean
and
refreshing
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
earth
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
time
d
a
true
classic
what
a
wonderfully
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
great
complex
flavors
are
bold
but
not
overwhelming
not
much
to
detract
from
this
great
beer
d
amazing
im
glad
i
found
this
and
bought
it
on
a
whim
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
least
with
this
impulse
buy
get
it
when
you
find
it
the
only
downside
is
the
price
not
an
every
day
drinker
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
750ml
bottle
d
not
an
over
the
top
saison
but
a
very
good
one
none
the
less
i
feel
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
so
i
am
hoping
to
get
another
and
hope
that
this
skunky
taste
is
a
aftermath
thought
i
will
try
again
and
hopefully
edit
my
reveiw
this
is
how
it
stands
as
of
now
t
smooth
beer
and
no
hint
of
6
5
abv
easy
as
hell
to
drink
a
full
750
solo
d
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
overall
and
a
great
introduction
to
the
saison
style
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
more
subdued
than
others
ive
tried
but
its
also
more
balanced
and
showcases
more
of
the
farmhouse
funk
i
look
forward
to
in
a
saison
d
very
tasty
brew
future
outlook
happy
to
have
again
and
would
like
to
try
with
some
age
on
it
had
this
on
draft
at
ormsbys
in
atlanta
ga
ive
had
it
plenty
of
times
in
the
bottle
as
well
it
pours
with
nice
hazy
yellow
golden
color
with
a
good
amout
of
head
it
has
nice
a
nice
crisp
flavor
with
a
touch
of
floral
and
fruitness
and
with
a
bit
funky
sour
yeasty
flavor
but
its
very
balanced
overall
its
very
dry
and
crisp
and
delicious
a
highly
drinkable
example
their
seasonal
version
with
a
higher
abv
punches
through
the
flavor
profile
but
this
version
is
the
year
round
choice
with
only
a
few
contenders
highly
recommended
served
from
a
750
ml
bottle
pours
a
semiopaque
golden
with
a
substantial
head
that
persists
leaving
about
a
one
inch
layer
of
foam
and
significant
lacing
aroma
is
not
overpowering
and
features
a
very
pleasant
hops
tartness
and
green
apples
upfront
with
notes
of
maltiness
present
in
the
background
taste
features
more
muted
tartness
and
green
apples
along
with
a
bit
of
barnyard
presence
decent
mouthfeel
featuring
a
restrained
level
of
carbonation
im
not
overly
familiar
with
this
particular
style
or
belgian
products
in
general
but
im
impressed
by
its
smoothness
and
excellent
drinkability
d
i
could
probably
put
back
to
750mm
bottles
without
breaking
a
sweat
this
is
one
of
the
more
perfect
beers
for
all
occasions
saison
dupont
is
a
standout
belgian
beer
not
just
for
its
taste
and
quality
but
also
because
it
characterizes
the
nation
itselfnever
straying
too
far
into
one
camp
whether
it
be
funk
or
sweetness
flanders
or
wallonia
it
somehow
travels
down
the
middle
in
an
impressive
balancing
act
overall
a
very
hoppy
and
earthy
saison
that
is
very
straightforward
and
refreshing
and
really
keeps
to
style
and
purpose
a
refreshing
beer
to
soothe
the
soul
after
a
long
and
hot
day
at
work
d
outstanding
just
a
really
amazingly
easy
to
drink
beer
so
refreshing
and
a
perfect
way
to
end
another
scorcher
clean
crisp
everything
i
would
want
in
a
saison
d
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
not
too
sour
has
an
interesting
and
striking
balance
drinkability
an
often
overlooked
saison
by
me
but
for
the
price
and
everyday
availability
this
is
a
real
gem
this
beer
goes
down
great
on
a
hot
day
such
as
today
or
even
a
cold
winter
evening
exceptionally
drinkable
might
be
the
combination
of
todays
heat
and
the
refreshing
dry
nature
of
this
beer
i
dont
typically
like
to
give
5s
but
i
dont
see
how
a
beer
could
be
any
more
drinkable
best
saison
ive
had
yet
cheers
d
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
its
a
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
months
high
carbonation
dry
light
bodied
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
not
a
good
but
a
very
nice
beer
none
the
less
the
taste
is
very
lively
with
some
of
the
orangelemon
flavors
coming
back
as
well
as
some
thick
yeastiness
the
back
end
is
very
dry
with
a
moderate
level
of
bitterness
the
body
is
very
dry
with
an
appropriatley
high
level
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
fun
to
drink
and
is
a
champ
with
food
d
i
found
the
perfect
saison
at
long
last
d
an
excellent
beer
to
cleanse
the
palate
or
just
sip
on
a
hot
day
d
with
its
dry
and
complex
flavor
i
want
to
think
this
has
a
higher
abv
than
it
really
does
knowing
that
i
could
easily
down
several
on
a
nice
hot
day
what
a
great
beer
seems
to
be
some
inconsistency
between
bottles
i
think
it
can
be
attributed
to
poor
handling
in
shipping
always
a
great
beer
but
some
bottles
seem
to
be
better
than
others
a
classic
character
that
hit
every
good
quality
of
a
saison
in
one
form
or
another
very
middle
of
the
road
in
possible
flavors
from
the
very
musty
farm
herbal
to
the
very
fruity
spice
nose
is
funk
and
belgian
yeast
nice
traditional
look
of
straw
murky
even
from
a
tap
palate
of
very
delicate
sweet
with
floral
qualities
some
citrus
that
transforms
with
the
help
of
the
must
into
something
bitter
dry
but
mild
anise
and
lavender
the
bitterness
of
grass
the
sweetness
of
roses
the
must
of
hot
straw
in
the
barn
great
a
must
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
that
was
nice
for
the
style
a
nice
saison
overall
that
was
crisp
and
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
cooler
summer
night
decent
saison
but
fairly
tart
and
bitter
i
still
like
hennepin
best
and
look
forward
to
trying
a
fantome
in
the
future
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
monsterous
poof
of
soapy
foamy
white
head
minutes
go
by
before
i
can
finnish
the
pour
scent
is
of
bready
yeast
hints
of
grahmn
cracker
grassy
lemmony
spicy
and
herbal
hops
all
present
in
the
nose
taste
is
slightly
less
agressive
then
the
scent
dictates
but
still
bold
fr
the
style
the
grassy
lemmony
spicy
and
herbal
hops
dominate
the
palate
while
a
backbone
of
nice
bready
yeasts
and
clean
malts
provide
the
backbone
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
some
muddled
earthyness
pop
up
from
sip
to
sip
for
all
the
carbonationation
the
beer
stll
has
a
slight
bit
of
body
to
it
nice
clean
and
dry
finnish
with
a
slight
herbal
aftertaste
a
very
nice
and
complex
saison
one
i
would
love
to
try
again
750
from
wf
clarendon
paired
with
fresh
parsley
tarragon
pasta
andouille
sausage
and
squash
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
that
is
refreshing
dry
and
extremely
complex
i
have
had
many
bottles
of
this
and
since
it
is
bottle
conditioned
each
one
is
different
though
quite
good
the
beer
is
nicely
drinkable
id
say
that
it
would
go
very
well
with
simple
fare
like
your
standard
burger
and
fries
or
perhaps
a
chicken
parm
sub
jd
d
very
light
and
fluffy
slightly
sweet
up
front
drying
out
and
becoming
tart
and
a
bit
chalky
in
the
finish
excellent
beer
bravo
pours
cloudy
pale
golden
with
frothy
head
aroma
is
a
quite
fresh
bouquet
of
anise
cloves
juniper
peaches
rosewater
and
grass
flavor
has
a
clean
character
with
notes
of
lemon
slightly
astringent
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
and
a
lightly
sour
finish
these
combine
for
a
refreshing
character
great
summer
or
anytime
beer
d
drinks
pretty
well
but
for
some
reason
couldnt
bring
myself
to
do
2
definitely
a
must
try
for
a
fan
of
the
style
i
think
i
paid
9
for
the
bottle
and
consider
that
a
deal
amazing
pour
and
color
as
well
ive
had
a
few
of
the
american
brewers
version
of
a
farmhouse
ale
and
this
is
a
whole
different
ballgame
i
want
more
even
a
deliberately
delicate
pour
on
this
fresh
bottle
of
hazy
gold
brew
leads
to
a
vigorous
bright
white
head
taking
several
moments
to
settle
into
a
manageable
frothy
cap
that
endured
the
entire
session
and
produced
intensive
lacing
waning
to
some
lingering
patches
as
the
glass
wares
down
an
herbal
spicy
aroma
leads
to
a
pleasantly
moderate
mix
of
malt
and
hops
sweet
at
first
with
a
touch
of
sour
citrus
and
mild
bitterness
finishing
the
flavor
not
terribly
strong
nor
tremendously
interesting
yet
absolutely
delicious
all
the
same
quite
well
suited
for
its
intended
purpose
a
hot
summers
day
notes
awesome
summerhot
weather
beer
completely
enjoyable
and
i
imagine
that
this
would
pair
very
well
with
seasoned
chicken
or
spicy
food
very
drinkable
drank
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
myself
light
bodied
and
tasty
there
was
a
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
from
what
ive
heard
saisons
should
typically
have
less
alcohol
but
that
didnt
stop
me
from
drinking
this
notes
this
and
hennepin
are
two
of
the
best
highest
rated
saisons
i
have
had
however
they
are
very
distinct
where
hennepin
is
almost
dark
and
earthy
with
spicy
notes
this
is
bright
floral
and
almost
fruity
at
times
this
beer
drinks
exactly
like
the
bottle
says
starts
floral
and
fruity
and
finishes
light
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
and
if
you
like
bright
saisons
it
is
a
must
try
d
quite
quaffable
easy
drinking
a
classic
textbook
saison
proves
to
be
an
excellent
value
as
well
overall
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sam
adams
summer
ale
but
with
a
little
less
spice
and
more
must
no
need
for
me
to
have
that
or
this
again
smuttynoses
farmhouse
ale
is
something
i
would
get
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
hazy
golden
body
with
carbonation
showing
itself
with
a
big
foaming
head
it
actually
falls
pretty
quickly
the
color
is
really
nice
in
the
aroma
this
one
is
all
about
the
yeast
and
letting
it
shine
nose
is
distinctly
funky
belgian
it
has
that
earthy
barnyard
aroma
with
a
nice
fruitiness
including
pear
and
apple
the
taste
actually
has
a
nice
crisp
maltiness
holding
it
together
with
the
yeast
playing
a
more
subtle
role
adding
some
light
fresh
fruitiness
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
but
really
makes
it
refreshing
plenty
of
body
for
a
beer
this
dry
a
subtle
raw
earthiness
to
it
everything
in
the
flavor
is
subtle
light
and
refreshing
yet
delicious
pretty
hard
to
find
a
better
summer
beer
than
this
conclusion
so
glad
to
have
finally
gotten
to
try
this
this
and
hennepin
are
the
two
best
saisons
ive
ever
had
which
is
better
id
have
to
try
them
side
by
side

dthis

i
only
had
1

im
glad
that
i
tried
it

probably
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
again
soon

sweetness
with
a

on
the
finish
light
balanced
and
just
a
hint
of
funk
to
keep
things
interesting
wasnt
bowled
over
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
this
saison
has
really
grown
on
me
the
last
couple
times
d
eh
i
thought
good
at
first
but
now
that
im
down
to
the
end
id
want
it
over
soon
its
good
very
dry
it
loses
points
here
because
the
carbonations
making
me
a
little
too
burpy
drinkability
a
true
sipper
that
fills
your
mouth
and
finishes
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
a
bomber
by
yourself
a
fantastic
farmhouse
that
i
will
definitely
drink
again
this
is
a
very
earthy
crisp
dry
saison
for
me
this
makes
drinkability
through
the
roof
the
yeast
is
the
cornerstone
on
this
beer
with
the
spicy
bitterness
being
the
bricks
and
the
sour
dryness
being
the
mortar
although
there
is
a
lot
more
going
on
with
this
complex
beer
a
stellar
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
them
in
a
six
pack
d
this
is
a
good
saison
although
the
hype
is
not
all
its
meant
to
be
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
its
sure
to
quench
any
thirst
pretty
good
saison
although
i
think
i
lean
more
towards
those
that
end
somewhat
sweet
this
one
is
a
bit
too
dry
in
the
finish
for
me
but
still
a
very
fine
beer
overall
d
i
need
to
drink
this
beer
more
often
its
a
very
solid
saison
m
d
i
wish
there
was
more
of
a
malt
structure
to
complement
the
spectacular
aroma
but
the
drinkability
will
be
great
for
those
who
like
the
drier
finish
co2
was
ideal
pours
a
slight
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
hugh
fluffy
white
head
that
recedes
slowly
to
leave
lots
of
clinging
lace
its
light
smelling
in
spice
some
clove
and
some
fruit
with
slight
yeast
the
taste
is
outstanding
its
crisp
and
clean
very
refreshing
with
lemon
and
pepper
notes
lots
of
yeast
and
floral
pairings
for
the
palate
some
applemelon
and
some
hops
round
out
this
well
balanced
saison
the
mouthfell
is
light
but
a
saison
is
meant
for
the
warmer
months
this
is
oh
so
drinkable
and
just
a
pleasure
to
the
last
drop
so
drinkable
and
simple
yet
it
is
complex
in
the
layers
of
flavor
that
are
present
highly
recommended
great
drinking
didnt
last
long
overall
if
you
told
me
that
saison
dupon
had
been
bootlegged
id
probably
believe
you
it
doesnt
have
much
alcohol
but
it
packs
a
punch
o
a
great
drinking
beer
it
is
as
refreshing
as
a
german
wheat
beer
but
with
more
snap
and
bite
my
favorite
saison
and
the
only
one
i
can
find
on
tap
d
pretty
good
about
average
for
a
saison
medium
body
medium
crisp
carbonation
and
dry
d
this
is
a
very
good
saison
nice
and
fruity
and
earthy
that
leaves
a
dry
finish
leaving
you
wanting
more
i
really
enjoyed
this
classic
for
the
style
and
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future
overall
a
great
saison
and
great
example
of
the
style
tastes
and
smells
great
and
is
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
d
fantastic
on
this
hot
day
perfect
summer
beer
for
all
occasions
alcohol
is
low
enough
to
make
it
drinkable
very
refreshing
in
character
tasty
wellmade
but
still
feels
pretty
full
to
me
definitely
one
id
go
for
repeatedly
but
two
in
a
sitting
would
probably
be
my
limit
this
beer
pours

crisp

id
love
to
have
this
beer
with
some
crab
cakes
on
a
summer
night
sitting
on
the
patio
definitely
recommend
will
drink
again
often
in
the
summer
d
shared
this
beer
with
my
dad
and
some
fruit
flies
it
was
so
so
tasty
and
refreshing
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
d
very
drinkable
beer
has
all
the
components
of
a
great
saison
without
being
too
overpowering
love
this
beer
d
i
always
buy
the
little
bottle
and
wish
i
had
the
big
bottle
if
only
it
didnt
need
to
be
imported
id
drink
this
with
almost
every
meal
this
one
lives
up
to
the
reputation
wow
this
must
be
awesome
with
food
alone
even
with
the
lighter
edge
you
must
sip
and
this
is
good
as
it
prolongs
the
enjoyment
absolutely
worth
the
try
a
this
beer
looks
like
a
hefe
weizen
but
more
substantial
and
cloudy
with
a
bit
of
floating
yeast
the
white
head
is
foamier
than
average
and
leaves
behind
a
sticky
lacing
s
really
funky
armpitlike
but
with
a
sweetness
bold
is
the
best
word
for
it
the
smell
is
almost
intimidating
at
first
t
the
most
dominant
to
me
is
a
sweet
wheat
bread
flavor
followed
by
a
slight
alcohol
sting
muskyness
then
a
lingering
bitterness
not
as
much
as
an
ipa
but
still
agressive
m
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
for
me
very
nice
feels
round
and
slightly
viscous
coating
my
mouth
with
the
strong
flavor
nice
refreshing
small
bubbled
carbonation
d
i
really
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
very
powerful
flavor
for
me
this
is
a
sampling
sipping
beer
reviewed
from
phone
so
forgive
the
format
d
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
prefer
my
saisons
a
bit
sweeter
but
this
is
a
very
balanced
and
wonderful
saison
especially
for
those
who
find
some
of
them
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
forget
witbiers
for
the
summer
id
rather
take
one
of
these
down
after
mowing
the
lawn
refreshing
and
complex
i
could
drink
this
until
i
couldnt
make
it
back
to
the
fridge
any
more
on
tap
at
als
served
in
a
classy
little
saison

it
is
quite
drinkable

light
fruit
blended
with
grain
comes
through
and
is
left
in
the
mouth
drinkability
refreshing
complex
balanced

this
is
a
top
notch
beer
that
deserves
its
fame
i
definitely
wanted
to
keep
sipping
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
including
it
on
my
shopping
list
in
the
future
this
would
be
perfect
for
drinking
on
a
warm
summer
evening
while
relaxing
after
a
busy
day
caged
and
corked
large
green
glass
bottle
big
aroma
after
popping
the
cork
which
did
not
disappoint
in
the
sound
department
substaintial
head
and
solid
carbonation
nice
lacing
almost
an
earthy
kind
of
smell
to
this
brew
starts
a
bit
fruity
but
ends
with
a
dry
finish
a
great
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
saison
its
light
and
goes
down
easily
not
as
funky
as
some
examples
of
the
style
but
quite
enjoyable
im
glad
i
finally
had
it
notes
might
be
a
great
example
of
a
saison
but
maybe
saisons
arent
really
my
thing
drinkability
is
good
a
solid
summer
beer
a
bit
higher
in
octane
than
some
saisons
but
definitely
worthy
of
mass
quantities
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
dry
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
obvious
in
the
feel
this
beer
clearly
gets
better
as
it
warms
for
me
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
i
love
the
way
it
goes
with
most
foods
as
well
one
of
the
driest
beers
on
earth
which
along
with
the
bracing
bitterness
makes
this
a
super
refreshing
beer
so
complex
unique
and
interesting
this
is
still
the
unmatched
quintessential
example
of
a
saison
one
of
my
favorites
i
wont
claim
that
i
rate
purely
against
style
because
i
found
this
a
great
representative
of
a
style
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
warm
weather
brew
but
it
is
not
my
favorite
saison
i
dont
think
fantome
can
be
dethroned
served
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
it
slow
so
i
can
enjoy
d
i
can
see
why
the
bottle
says
it
was
made
for
summer
easy
drinking
with
good
flavor
but
nothing
overpowering
a
good
definition
for
the
style
although
it
seems
saisons
seem
to
be
all
over
the
board
m
nice
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
nice
profile
and
good
co2
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
and
nice
abv
great
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
funk
but
this
was
good
glad
to
have
sampled
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
a
foamy
amount
of
carbonation
this
may
be
the
most
classic
example
of
a
farmhouse
ale
one
can
find
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
peppery
note
and
mildly
floral
and
slightly
funky
yeast
notes
carbonation
is
bright
but
not
too
fizzy
white
wine
and
lemon
notes
at
the
finish
overall
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
drinkability
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
i
for
one
am
glad
that
the
saison
is
experiencing
a
revival
drinkability
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
an
amazing
summer
time
beer
and
its
just
so
clean
and
palate
cleansing
would
go
amazing
i
think
with
just
so
many
meals
its
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beverage
one
i
would
certainly
recommend
again
its
complex
yet
simple
and
thats
a
good
thing
will
be
a
beer
i
will
definitely
visit
again
hazy
tawny
golden
color
with
some
bone
white
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
good
with
some
tart
and
acidic
citrus
notes
bready
malt
and
some
musty
yeastiness
as
well
taste
follows
suit
some
citrus
notes
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
to
back
it
up
creamy
and
fullbodied
this
one
is
not
overcarbonated
like
many
american
versions
of
the
style
great
drinkability
the
theme
of
this
one
is
balance
and
melding
of
flavors
a
bit
reserved
i
missed
some
of
the
funkiness
that
others
talk
about
d
sweet
and
delicious
like
lemonade
on
a
hot
day
but
there
is
only
so
much
acidity
one
can
take
sessionably
but
not
all
day
long
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
and
a
really
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
its
a
great
fusion
between
a
light
drinkable
beer
and
some
traditional
funky
belgian
farmhouse
tastes
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
saisons
to
see
how
they
stack
up
because
this
is
a
great
beer
medium
body
sweet
first
and
then
some
bitterness
almost
a
duvel
like
feeling
to
it
as
the
beer
warms
up
there
is
more
subtly
to
the
flavors
more
sulfur
more
sour
great
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
its
probably
one
of
the
nicest
and
readily
available
saisons
on
the
market
d
intense
on
the
palate
but
in
a
good
way
d
oh
yeah
i
could
see
this
being
a
goto
ale
in
the
hot
summer
months
it
refreshes
rather
than
wears
out
the
palate
i
cant
say
enough
about
the
good
qualities
of
this
beer
highly
recommended
overall
an
excellent
version
of
the
saison
style
everything
it
should
be
d
hell
yeah
its
drinkable
but
for
the
price
drinkable
on
the
right
occation
like
an
into
to
friends
or
a
high
end
dinner
to
freshin
the
palete
with
rich
foods
overall
i
think
its
a
hallmark
of
the
style
but
i
would
hope
in
the
sense
that
it
allows
a
foundation
for
others
to
build
on
and
refine
rather
than
duplicate
as
theres
a
sort
of
disharmony
at
the
root
of
this
beer
for
me
drinkability
i
could
see
how
people
would
love
this
beer
but
it
is
not
my
thing
the
funk
is
really
present
and
so
are
the
belgian
spices
at
times
this
tastes
like
a
witbier
the
beer
is
complex
and
is
worth
a
try
i
am
just
not
likely
to
get
it
for
the
price
drinkability
all
day
every
day
lol
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
for
anybody
i
could
never
get
tired
of
it
ive
even
thought
about
sticking
a
few
in
my
cellar
to
see
how
they
turn
out
with
a
bit
of
age
mmmm
mmmm
delicious
light
to
medium
body
crisp
and
refreshing
all
around
this
is
a
classic
saison
great
for
hot
days
especially
but
enjoyable
any
time
of
year
extremely
drinkable
and
something
i
never
get
tired
of
the
classic
mother
of
all
saisons
you
owe
to
yourself
and
beergeeks
everywhere
to
at
least
try
this
a
superb
offering
from
the
mecca
of
beer
belgium
great
in
the
heat
or
cold
months
of
the
year
good
with
almost
any
type
of
food
also
this
ia
a
beer
that
you
should
always
have
on
stock
highly
reccomend
this
to
all
taste
crisp
and
clean
taste
spicy
yeast
character
slight
fresh
tart
apple
fruitiness
this
is
the
saison
that
other
saisons
are
compared
to
this
is
the
benchmark
for
the
style
for
good
reason
too
everything
that
saison
lovers
enjoy
about
belgian
farmhouse
ales
is
here
in
some
capacity
and
while
ive
had
better
saisons
some
that
add
brettonamyces
some
that
up
the
hops
this
is
a
staple
of
my
fridge
a
beer
with
few
peers
notes
lots
of
different
flavors
with
the
taste
on
your
tongue
changing
every
sip
you
take
drinkability
a
pleasant
saison
that
is
definately
foreign
to
my
taste
buds
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
if
i
had
more
of
this
beer
id
be
happier
if
youre
just
discovering
this
style
this
is
a
must
drink
if
youre
familiar
with
this
style
you
know
how
great
this
beer
is
decent
for
its
beer
type
but
id
be
okay
not
getting
this
again
overall
this
is
one
of
the
classics
all
other
saisons
get
measured
up
to
this
one
a
great
measuring
stick
in
my
opinion
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
it
today
at
our
beer
tasting
at
my
work
wines
unlimited
and
it
had
an
entire
array
of
exotic
flavors
when
i
looked
at
the
beer
in
my
tasting
glass
it
looked
yellowish
with
hints
of
green
reflection
glow
good
head
and
retention
the
smell
was
intense
and
could
be
smelled
at
least
3
feet
away
it
smelled
of
grass
hops
skunk
and
i
caught
a
note
of
sweetness
in
the
smell
then
i
drank
it
slowly
the
flavors
really
explode
on
the
palate
and
lingers
well
after
the
consumption
this
i
think
is
a
world
class
beer
flavor
is
mellow
compared
to
aroma
with
notes
of
clove
grapefruit
and
vanilla
more
funky
and
spicy
than
fruity
with
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
not
sweet
but
dry
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
baby
duvel
brilliant
creamy
moutfeel
and
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
at
6
5
percent
the
classic
saison
each
sip
leaves
me
wanting
more
this
bottle
will
be
no
problem
to
polish
off
dthis
beer
is
a
perfect
refresher
and
could
easily
be
enjoyed
all
night
though
its
not
really
widely
available
in
the
states
but
if
it
was
i
would
definately
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
d
perfect
for
almost
any
occasion
widely
palatable
great
for
pairing
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
great
smooth
and
medium
with
nice
grainy
characteristics
all
in
all
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
i
think
im
becoming
a
fan
of
the
saison
style
d
very
good
and
light
easygoing
as
well
d
saison
dupont
was
the
first
farmhouse
ale
i
tried
a
little
over
3
years
ago
still
holds
up
to
my
first
impressions
like
this
one
a
lot
taste
is
slightly
tartsweet
with
lemon
spicey
herb
yeast
a
lot
of
grain
some
hay
pear
faint
hint
of
banana
it
has
light
spicey
bitterness
that
comes
up
near
the
finish
and
lingers
to
join
the
mostly
sweettart
character
feel
is
slightly
oily
but
not
very
and
also
a
bit
lively
it
has
anisyherbalpeppery
qualities
that
come
through
a
lot
but
are
restrained
and
balanced
with
the
other
elements
it
is
dry
but
not
too
dry
drinkability
is
wicked
high
i
could
drink
this
by
the
bucketful
during
the
summer
when
i
tried
this
beer
before
it
was
great
bright
clean
and
inviting
i
will
be
sure
to
review
this
one
again
saison
dupont
is
a
measuring
stick
for
the
style
its
the
classic
saison
and
while
its
not
the
best
saison
in
my
eyes
it
is
totally
deserving
of
all
the
praise
its
received
several
aspects
of
this
beer
are
simply
stellar
the
appearance
is
great
the
mouthfeel
is
incredible
and
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
notes
its
a
decent
beer
that
for
me
lingers
too
close
to
blah
qualities
for
all
its
hype
and
complexities
it
is
too
close
to
some
funky
european
largers
or
their
better
pilsner
sisters
in
fact
primarily
from
the
people
ive
shared
the
brew
with
those
that
claimed
that
macro
euro
lagers
were
their
beer
of
choice
seemed
to
be
the
most
pleased
by
this
ale
maybe
in
that
regard
it
is
not
too
bad
a
beer
to
have
people
switching
gears
towards
craft
brews
maybe
its
the
icon
reference
for
saisons
but
there
are
a
few
ahead
of
it
within
the
style
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
that
has
has
great
retention
the
aroma
is
complex
with
some
fruity
herbal
smells
up
front
and
a
little
funky
backend
there
is
a
slight
citrus
flavor
to
the
very
effervescent
beer
a
little
lemon
and
some
herbs
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
375
ml
bottle
to
glass
champagne
type
cork
kinda
fun
to
pop
pours
with
a
ton
of
foam
almost
a
gusher
looks
cloudy
dark
yellow
smells
earthy
and
a
little
grainy
taste
is
fairly
big
but
not
necessarily
malty
nor
hoppy
sort
of
starchy
or
grainy
maybe
funky
i
liked
it
good
drinkability
after
you
get
your
bearings
this
has
a
pretty
unique
flavor
d
stylistically
very
nice
a
cleaner
saison
with
skunky
flare
but
very
very
enjoyable
and
continued
to
grow
on
me
drinkability
great
beer
an
maybe
the
perfect
macro
transitional
beer
finally
sitting
down
to
review
this
classic
poured
a
corked
and
caged
375
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
leaving
just
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
big
and
fruity
up
front
ripe
fruits
like
apples
and
pears
are
in
the
forefront
leading
to
light
hay
damp
earth
with
a
light
grassy
hop
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
ripe
apple
and
pears
coming
through
up
front
musty
earth
light
grass
hay
and
just
a
bit
of
aspirin
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
finishes
just
a
bit
sweeter
then
i
would
have
liked
i
really
much
prefer
a
dry
finish
to
a
saison
nonetheless
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
ture
belgian
saison
in
short
this
is
the
quintessential
saison
farmhouse
ale
the
best
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
saison
duponts
strength
is
in
the
perfect
balance
of
its
flavor
profile
delicious
and
refreshing
simply
a
classic
all
in
all
this
quite
an
upstanding
saison
definitely
worth
a
try
d
a
great
farmhouse
with
all
the
right
things
going
for
it
my
only
complaint
is
how
bitter
it
gets
overtime
from
the
yeast
i
would
gladly
like
to
see
more
of
this
though
in
my
fridge
on
the
occasion
when
my
mood
for
it
fits
great
example
and
great
appearance
nice
thick
chunky
rings
of
lace
are
left
after
the
big
creamy
frothy
head
dies
down
golden
orange
body
lots
of
lemon
peel
grassy
herbal
notes
in
the
nose
which
is
otherwise
dominated
by
yeast
the
taste
is
well
done
spicy
with
a
big
clove
and
coriander
backing
peppery
with
banana
and
fresh
cut
golden
apples
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
crisp
and
refreshing
good
beer
would
have
earned
higher
scores
if
the
yeast
wasnt
as
prevalent
d
nice
enough
for
a
time
i
like
it
poured
from
a
375
ml
half
bottle
into
two
tulip
glasses
huge
white
head
forms
from
the
start
looks
like
meringue
so
thick
and
fluffy
body
was
hazy
yellow
and
cloudy
smell
was
lemony
and
pinelike
taste
was
tart
and
refreshing
the
citrus
flavor
gave
this
beer
a
nice
tang
but
the
mouthfeel
of
this
farmhouse
ale
really
balanced
things
well
it
was
so
smooth
light
crisp
and
mellow
not
overpowering
though
so
it
paired
well
with
a
variety
of
cheeses
a
very
flavorful
and
classic
example
of
a
belgian
saison
i
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
and
poured
it
into
several
wine
glassesi
shared
it
with
nonbeer
drinking
friends
at
a
dinner
party
it
is
a
hazy
cloudy
gold
with
a
massive
long
lasting
white
head
lemon
zest
is
prevalent
on
the
nose
along
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
the
flavor
was
as
good
as
advertised
lemony
spicy
with
a
drying
finish
the
beer
is
highly
carbonated
mediumlight
in
body
and
it
goes
great
with
any
food
everyone
who
tried
it
agreed
it
is
a
damn
fine
brew
drinkability
the
complex
taste
keeps
you
interested
but
the
higher
carbonation
and
dry
crisp
finish
lets
you
drink
it
down
a
very
enjoyable
first
experience
with
with
brasserie
dupont
d
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
popular
a
wonderful
saison
and
one
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
warm
afternoon
t
it
has
a
vegetable
maltiness
to
it
kind
of
lagery
with
an
ale
aftertaste
some
bitterness
expecially
in
the
aftertaste
for
an
11
bottle
i
expect
a
more
sophisticated
taste
md
light
to
medium
in
texture
the
feel
of
this
beer
evolves
with
temperature
and
time
it
has
been
poured
initially
there
is
a
strong
effervescent
feel
but
as
the
beer
warms
and
sits
exposed
to
air
the
beer
turns
smooth
and
almost
silky
finishing
nice
and
dry
there
is
a
lot
of
great
stuff
going
on
with
this
beer
every
overlying
feature
that
i
was
looking
for
in
the
flavor
was
there
and
they
all
went
together
in
a
near
perfect
balance
i
would
drink
a
full
750ml
bottle
by
myself
if
i
could
but
i
guess
i
dont
mind
sharing
either
a
bit
acidic
feeling
sort
of
like
orange
juice
on
an
empty
stomach
altogether
a
solid
beer
worthy
of
trying
d
not
as
much
complexity
as
i
remeber
it
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
on
tap
a
refreshing
beer
and
very
drinkable
will
have
to
seek
it
out
on
tap
again
to
see
if
it
was
like
i
remembered
classic
for
a
reason
purchased
this
12
7
oz
bottle
from
big
z
beverage
in
huntington
ny
the
pour
is
cloudy
yellow
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
around
for
a
while
what
a
fantastic
smell
its
funky
citrusy
and
a
little
spicy
taste
is
the
same
its
somewhat
complex
but
also
smooth
very
refreshing
and
wellbalanced
a
must
try
overall
one
of
the
premier
examples
of
the
saisonfarmhouse
style
santé
d
very
good
i
paired
this
with
thanksgiving
dinner
the
lightness
went
very
well
and
didnt
conflict
with
any
of
the
flavors
this
was
my
first
saison
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
d
good
i
like
this
beer
alot
the
price
tag
keeps
me
coming
back
for
me
j
served
in
a
tulip
from
a
750ml
bottle
the
earthy
aroma
was
pretty
apparent
even
as
i
poured
my
first
glass
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
frothy
head
i
got
the
same
foam
on
the
last
glass
that
i
did
on
the
first
and
the
lacing
lingered
nicely
aroma
is
a
strong
one
tough
to
pin
down
but
the
best
way
to
describe
it
would
be
the
haybarnyard
aroma
i
associate
with
saisons
taste
is
a
little
strong
a
little
acerbic
pleasant
but
ive
tasted
others
i
prefer
very
dry
finish
definitely
a
palate
cleanser
ive
always
thought
of
this
as
the
standard
for
the
style
but
to
be
honest
id
rather
have
a
hennepin
as
it
warms
some
of
the
unbalanced
characteristics
seem
to
temper
but
i
must
wholeheartedly
admit
that
ive
always
found
this
saison
a
bit
disappointing
despite
its
reputation
dvery
easy
to
drink
not
overpowering
but
i
feel
like
i
need
more
in
the
taste
department
if
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
smell
it
would
be
much
better
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
sting
on
par
with
how
the
style
should
be
drinkability
is
very
high
due
to
the
refreshing
and
clean
nature
of
it
if
i
were
only
drinking
one
glass
i
would
rather
have
a
fantome
saison
but
for
a
session
you
can
send
this
one
my
way
any
time
good
beer
md
light
summer
drinker
imo
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
im
sure
a
few
of
these
would
go
down
easily
d
quite
the
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
bit
too
easy
overall
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
tried
and
a
great
value
just
might
become
a
regular
in
the
fridge
this
beer
has
a
cloudy
golden
look
smells
great
like
the
typical
belgian
style
ale
the
taste
is
good
the
hops
and
tartness
provide
great
flavor
its
hard
to
put
the
beer
down
mouthfeel
is
nice
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
also
good
i
just
drank
one
and
i
think
i
need
another
appearance
is
good
some
small
head
and
nice
lacing
smell
is
good
nice
hops
and
upfront
spicing
that
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
taste
is
pretty
good
but
a
little
less
balanced
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
good
but
i
prefer
hennipen
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
in
body
drinkability
is
good
as
well
saison
dupont
is
a
classic
and
it
is
no
surprise
that
it
is
a
great
saison
with
great
drinkability
dtasty
and
as
i
sai
surprisingly
refreshing
d
i
am
kind
of
iffy
with
this
beer
i
liked
it
enough
but
something
didnt
fully
click
for
me
the
aroma
was
the
highpoint
by
far
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
am
in
no
hurry
to
drink
another
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
with
no
alcohol
presences
and
the
right
balance
between
the
other
flavors
pours
a
cloudy
maize
color
34
inch

of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
tart
malt
earthy
malt
yeast
and
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
pale
malt
grain
slight
citrus
slight
hops
and
tart
malt
d
a
very
traditional
example
a
classic
of
the
style
it
has
high
drinkability
even
though
it
might
not
be
my
first
choice
in
saisons
it
is
very
enjoyable
refreshing
tasty
and
interesting
saison
dupont
offers
a
lot
to
the
punter
it
is
also
a
relatively
good
deal
for
the
price
while
not
as
funky
as
other
saisons
this
will
always
be
up
there
for
me
as
it
was
the
first
saison
i
ever
tried
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
it
until
now
and
continue
to
go
back
to
dm
dry
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
while
it
made
me
very
gassy
i
could
drink
it
all
day
d
this
brew
is
positively
delicious
one
of
the
best
widelyavailable
saisons
out
there
this
brew
is
such
a
wonderful
beer
to
pair
with
food
anything
from
fried
food
to
fresh
goats
milk
cheese
from
risotto
to
spicy
thai
food
this
brew
has
you
covered
if
you
havent
yet
tried
this
brew
do
yourself
a
favor
and
crack
open
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
very
nicely
carbonated
but
not
dry
on
the
finish
the
hops
leave
a
nice
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
nice
stuff
a
very
nice
drinkable
balanced
saison
the
beer
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
due
to
the
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
spot
on
d
very
good
this
could
be
a
beer
that
i
drink
anytime
d
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
had
with
some
ceviche
and
paired
very
well
drinkabilitiy
by
itself
it
was
slightly
disappointing
as
id
heard
great
things
about
this
beer
but
it
was
breathtaking
with
dinner
the
spicy
notes
in
the
beer
blending
beautifully
with
the
spices
in
the
food
and
the
fruity
flavors
were
perfect
with
the
juices
in
the
chicken
i
had
it
seemed
to
have
a
match
for
any
flavor
i
could
throw
at
it
definitely
do
it
with
food
it
was
amazing
d
saisons
were
meant
to
be
drank
on
hot
summer
days
while
working
on
a
farm
and
this
exemplifies
that
another
great
belgian
a
great
beer
especially
good
in
the
summer
sessionable
a
classic
typecast
drinkability
very
drinkable
d
not
as
good
as
hennepin
but
still
an
excellent
saison
miles
ahead
of
grassroots
ale
gag
me
the
slight
stench
of
skunk
was
a
little
bit
disappointing
perhaps
this
would
be
even
better
if
fresher
d4
5
finally
a
tremendously
light
crisp
mouthfeel
and
clean
flavors
make
saison
dupont
very
easy
to
drink
personally
anytime
saison
dupont
is
on
a
menu
i
almost
always
get
it
it
is
simply
one
of
my
favorites
tremendously
drinkable
terrific
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
flavors
would
also
work
very
well
during
the
crisp
fall
weather
very
enjoyable
overall
a
good
saison
glad
i
picked
it
up
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
dont
quite
get
the
overall
impression
here
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
spritzy
finishes
with
a
dry
palate
but
plenty
of
lingering
ibus
and
citrus
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
the
1st
true
saison
i
have
had
i
will
definately
try
it
again
drinkability
is
fair
one
750
will
polish
me
off
i
really
like
this
one
but
i
am
far
from
loving
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
hint
of
orange
a
super
creamy
soft
white
head
crowns
the
beer
smells
of
an
aromatic
belgian
yeast
strain
taste
is
quite
dry
flavors
from
spices
and
a
grassy
earthy
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
high
carbonation
quite
drinkable
a
good
saison
that
i
would
get
again
very
drinkable
very
interesting
taste
clean
and
sharp
with
a
taste
that
lingers
leaved
an
odd
taste
but
its
surprisingly
good
very
different
and
somewhat
pungent
i
have
to
say
this
is
quite
good
for
the
style
worth
checking
out
simply
an
awesome
summer
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
high
drinkability
the
carbonation
was
on
par
the
flavors
where
not
cloying
at
anytime
whatsoever
and
the
moderate
abv
makes
this
hard
to
beat
as
a
good
session
summer
beer
cheers
drinkability
is
superb
very
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
we
have
alot
of
those
where
i
live
everything
about
this
beer
is
outstanding
poured
with
a
ridiculously
big
head
but
what
a
head
like
a
meringue
couldve
eaten
it
with
a
spoon
laced
thickly
all
the
way
to
the
end
spicy
belgian
yeast
notes
on
the
nose
with
a
little
earthiness
in
the
background
follows
through
with
the
same
vibe
on
the
palate
highly
carbonated
alcohol
hangs
a
little
at
the
back
but
not
unpleasant
always
enjoyable
notes
what
a
treat
to
have
this
at
cafe
delerium
poured
a
nice
cloudly
gold
one
finger
head
pleasantely
skunky
smell
great
lacing
spicy
finish
slightly
hops
up
front
citrus
smell
and
taste
is
there
oakey
with
a
bitter
linger
in
the
mouth
i
thought
id
only
see
you
once
in
a
while
drinkability
is
very
nice
once
it
hits
that
temperature
sweet
spot
not
wearing
refreshing
but
full
complex
but
with
an
integrated
maturity
thats
very
satisfying
d
excellent
beer
to
have
on
a
nice
mild
sunny
day
a
little
high
abv
to
be
considered
session
but
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
i
could
see
drinking
a
good
number
of
these
excellent
saison
drinkability
a
classic
beer
that
i
have
waited
to
long
to
sample
my
wife
brought
this
home
from
chicago
for
me
knowing
enough
about
what
i
have
had
to
pick
something
up
that
i
havent
refreshingly
tart
with
a
light
malt
presence
and
grassy
hop
notes
i
could
almost
use
a
bit
more
funk
in
here
but
then
it
would
not
be
as
refreshingly
delicious
as
it
is
right
now
tastes
a
bit
like
chewing
on
a
fresh
hibiscus
spring
flower
terrific
beer
a
all
the
way
i
have
bought
more
than
a
few
saison
duponts
over
the
years
and
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
fragile
beer
as
some
offflavors
can
make
an
appearance
in
some
bottles
why
do
they
continue
to
use
these
green
bottles
but
there
is
nothing
quite
so
good
as
a
perfect
bottle
of
this
liquid
nectar
nearly
the
perfect
beer
on
tap
at
stone
nice
gold
color
with
a
cap
of
thick
white
froth
subtle
spicy
aroma
cloves
and
pepper
lemons
and
grain
flavor
is
similar
with
a
grainy
base
lemony
wheat
notes
and
a
dry
peppery
finish
perfect
balance
and
interplay
between
flavors
are
what
make
this
the
quintessential
saison
refreshing
and
drinkable
blipped
time
of
the
season
by
the
zombies
its
a
classic
d
easy
drink
its
great
try
it
d
refreshing
yet
i
can
only
drink
one
750ml
at
a
time
because
it
is
a
bit
heavy
feeling
the
clean
finish
poured
a
cloudy
gold
body
with
great
carbonation
for
a
frothy
twofinger
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
some
lace
a
very
sharp
semipungent
spice
and
clove
smell
with
some
eartgrassiness
and
a
good
amount
of
fruit
and
yeast
in
the
background
of
the
aroma
great
smoothness
that
is
balanced
with
a
wellcarbd
crispness
yeast
and
bread
malt
make
the
beer
somewhat
chewey
and
creamy
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
derived
from
the
fruit
flavoring
i
can
taste
pear
apple
orange
there
are
some
good
fruti
tastes
in
here
and
the
beer
finishes
slightly
dry
thanks
to
hops
and
little
funkiness
in
it
as
well
an
excellent
beer
to
pour
a
few
glasses
for
you
and
a
couple
of
friends
to
sip
on
drinkability
exceedingly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
with
loads
of
flavor
highly
carbonated
but
it
seems
to
be
appropriate
very
dry
finish
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
crisp
zesty
and
refreshing
good
stuff
especially
this
time
of
year
turns
out
the
bottle
i
bought
for
so
much
was
a
larger
version
of
the
same
beer
in
my
frig
i
will
give
the
small
cheaper
priced
bottle
to
my
girlfriend
to
try
an
easy
to
drink
saison
i
really
enjoyed
with
my
meal
i
conceder
this
a
great
go
to
brew
for
the
summer
season
drinkability
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
if
not
the
favorite
of
the
saison
farmhouse
ales
delicious
earthy
yeasty
funky
and
all
in
the
best
possible
usage
of
the
terms
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
never
disappoints
drinkability
even
if
your
not
a
hops
fan
which
i
am
not
theres
alot
to
absorb
here
with
and
without
food
this
is
a
beautiful
complex
beer
i
probably
would
buy
this
regularly
but
id
certainly
include
it
on
a
tasting
or
for
a
beer
dinner
mouthfeel
medium
and
soft
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
over
carbonated
really
would
love
to
drink
more
in
a
shot
as
the
bottle
is
rather
large
but
id
be
afraid
of
belching
up
enough
foam
that
it
would
look
like
a
crazy
bubblescene
from
the
willy
wonka
chocolate
factory
but
the
flavor
is
great
a
hazy
burnt
orange
appearance
with
a
large
fluffy
head
narrates
this
beautiful
drink
good
retention
and
sticky
lacing
on
the
sides
very
yeasty
aromas
with
hints
of
floral
and
honey
taste
is
a
bit
thin
but
a
palate
cleanser
indeed
a
dry
drink
with
a
solid
crispness
overall
a
great
saison
mouthfeel
is
dry
drawn
out
with
a
bounty
of
mid
sized
carbonation
bubbles
that
lend
at
times
a
crisp
then
soft
feel
overall
it
is
zesty
light
bodied
and
moves
well
it
is
never
boring
stays
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
standard
bearers
in
my
mind
even
though
it
might
not
be
the
apex
of
the
style
i
really
dont
like
this
all
that
much
its
not
bad
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
m
very
fizzy
carbonation
slightly
thinner
than
medium
bodied
d
yes
i
can
easily
see
one
becoming
two
threee
and
so
on
d
summer
is
almost
here
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
be
promoting
at
work
and
i
can
think
of
so
many
things
to
pair
this
with
d
a
great
beer
and
a
classic
saison
perhaps
the
best
in
its
style
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavors
drinkability
for
those
who
like
hops
and
grain
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
look
for
finish
sharp
dryness
but
smooth
and
really
rewarding
drinkability
is
ok
looking
past
the
imperfections
i
stated
i
could
see
myself
maybe
killing
a
750
of
this
with
a
long
meal
but
for
the
other
similar
choices
in
the
belgian
realm
ill
probably
overlook
this
one
next
time
im
at
the
beer
store
nice
saison
poured
at
cellar
temp
into
chalice
producing
a
huge
rocky
head
that
took
quite
some
time
to
diminish
with
golden
unfiltered
color
below
nose
was
sweet
floral
belgian
yeast
and
taste
is
similar
full
and
easy
to
drink
of
the
style
this
is
a
fantastic
example
and
to
be
corny
it
literally
bounces
of
the
taste
buds
and
really
does
go
well
on
a
nice
spring
evening
with
some
beef
medallions
from
the
grill
a
solid
and
quite
drinkable
beer
d
fantastic
saison
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
away
highly
recommended
if
you
enjoy
the
style
sweet
and
spicy
flavor
refreshing
as
usual
hop
aftertaste
could
and
have
drank
a
whole
750
ml
at
once
so
it
is
very
drinkable
d
i
have
very
little
to
say
about
this
beer
in
many
aspects
however
this
is
the
definition
of
a
saison
it
was
delicious
and
if
i
were
able
to
get
this
brew
more
often
i
would
be
drinking
this
all
summer
check
this
one
out
definitely
check
this
out
if
you
are
interested
in
brewing
a
saison
d
4
5
a
good
solid
example
of
a
saison
with
nice
dry
body
and
character
abv
is
a
a
bit
lower
than
some
saisons
6
5
so
this
a
a
nice
sessionable
brew
a
fair
price
for
a
belgian
at
8
for
a
750ml
bottle
broudys
biggish
creamy
mouthfeel
tiny
bubbles
work
over
your
tongue
and
get
you
ready
for
more
i
could
keep
drinking
this
forever
classic
awesome
saison
dupont
is
almost
the
standard
to
what
a
saison
should
taste
like
it
is
light
crisp
with
a
plesant
spicyness
in
the
finish
that
is
the
characteristic
of
the
yeast
a
lot
of
breweries
try
to
mess
with
and
make
saisons
extreem
but
noting
is
like
a
great
traditional
style
i
have
yet
to
like
one
that
deviates
from
the
simple
feel
of
this
beer
its
a
little
expensive
for
a
light
crisp
beer
but
its
imported
so
what
do
you
expect
wish
it
could
be
cheaper
would
keep
it
around
a
lot
more
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
in
my
life
lighter
in
body
than
expected
from
the
nose
not
overly
sweet
and
in
fact
offers
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
lots
of
spice
touch
of
apple
and
pear
and
a
long
finish
smooth
and
crisp
feel
with
a
nice
carbonation
quite
drinkable
notes
this
was
extremely
good
it
was
my
first
saison
and
i
think
i
am
already
hooked
especially
with
the
weather
warming
okay
only
to
the
50s
but
that
is
warming
this
is
what
a
hefeweizen
should
be
i
could
see
this
beer
pairing
very
well
with
many
dishes
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
good
ones
and
again
a
solid
old
world
standard
maybe
a
little
too
much
saaz
for
my
taste
but
this
one
is
extremely
bright
and
clean
welldone
to
say
the
least
mouthfeel
is
spicy
and
well
carbonated
overall
pretty
drinkable
ill
probably
finish
the
bottle
by
myself
tonight
d
highly
drinkable
although
not
the
most
drinkable
example
of
the
style
that
honor
would
probably
go
to
hennepin
quite
weizeny
on
the
palate
with
that
wheaty
banana
character
surprising
really
since
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
in
it
surprisingly
bitter
on
the
finish
a
lot
of
hops
coming
through
following
that
light
wheaty
flavour
this
leaves
me
to
be
honest
with
a
really
quite
sinking
heavy
feeling
because
it
feels
overhopped
without
enough
rich
barley
malt
to
balance
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
clunky
taste
is
pleasant
enough
but
its
quite
heavygoing
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
sessioning
beer
i
quite
respect
this
but
i
dont
like
it
all
that
much
unfortunately
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thick
cap
large
amount
of
tiny
bubbles
percolate
throughout
the
beer
lemongrass
and
pepper
comes
through
in
the
aroma
same
pepper
and
lemon
in
the
flavor
no
funkiness
whatsoever
finishes
drydrydry
seems
a
bit
one
dimensional
in
the
taste
i
thought
the
body
and
carbonation
went
very
well
together
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
is
not
one
the
best
saisons
out
there
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
have
to
say
i
like
my
american
versions
better
this
is
a
good
delicious
tasty
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
produced
right
here
in
the
u
s
of
a
t
way
too
easy
to
put
down
in
fact
its
drinkability
might
be
its
greatest
weakness
its
too
good
to
sip
and
savor
but
the
carbonation
has
a
bloating
effect
if
you
drink
too
quickly
anyway
this
is
outstanding
as
a
summer
thirstquencher
an
aperitif
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
just
about
any
dish
d
other
than
the
expensive
imported
price
of
almost
5
per
375
ml
12
4
oz
this
beer
would
be
a
great
six
pack
easy
to
drink
and
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
alltime
it
has
been
years
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
am
excited
to
finally
try
it
again
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
gold
with
hyperactive
carbonation
and
crowned
with
a
a
thick
white
head
smells
very
yeasty
with
light
fruits
and
spices
the
taste
just
blows
me
away
saison
dupont
is
such
an
allstar
that
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
way
it
makes
me
tongue
tingle
followed
by
a
sweet
fruity
and
spicy
blast
not
unlike
that
of
a
belgian
tripel
just
before
a
rush
of
orange
zest
hits
the
back
palate
and
lingers
on
the
finish
its
body
is
quite
extraordinary
tingly
like
i
said
but
has
a
very
substantial
body
that
gradually
breaks
down
and
softens
an
exceptional
beer
a
little
skunk
wafts
up
to
the
nose
upon
popping
the
cork
and
sometimes
thats
not
a
bad
thing
as
long
as
its
not
overwhelming
looking
at
the
bottle
art
i
imagine
myself
at
a
small
cafe
in
belgium
drinking
this
one
pours
a
dirty
gold
and
finishes
off
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
retention
is
good
as
it
takes
some
time
to
fade
a
few
spots
of
lacing
are
left
to
and
fro
smells
phenomenal
with
fresh
yeast
light
fruits
green
apples
pears
and
diacetyls
all
moving
in
perfect
balance
around
the
nose
tastes
spicy
and
a
bit
sour
with
more
light
fruits
big
malts
sweet
bread
and
yeast
goes
down
a
bit
dry
and
theres
plenty
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
medium
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
one
from
the
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
the
2nd
into
a
pint
glass
very
hazy
cloudy
and
golden
wheatish
in
color
thick
rocky
head
2
fingers
thick
and
she
stayed
around
quite
a
long
time
beautiful
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
of
grass
grains
and
very
fruity
with
a
slight
whif
of
hops
better
tasting
than
i
imagined
from
the
aroma
the
dupont
has
a
slightly
grainy
fruity
taste
to
it
with
the
slightest
amount
of
light
bitterness
to
it
as
i
drank
it
the
fruitiness
became
more
noticeable
without
killing
or
overcoming
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
so
very
smooth
almost
creamy
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
that
offsets
the
dryness
that
is
evident
later
on
really
alot
going
on
with
this
beer
extremely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
great
session
beer
you
have
to
try
this
one
great
beer
i
love
beer
with
wild
yeast
this
beer
would
great
on
a
hot
day
yet
its
a
bit
pricy
its
defiantly
worth
getting
at
least
once
d
the
dryness
just
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
more
not
filling
tasty
and
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
fruit
and
malt
p
s
much
better
from
the
bottle
the
is
such
a
subtle
complexity
to
this
one
that
you
really
have
to
study
it
take
your
time
this
one
is
a
real
pleasure
a
fantastic
offering
that
is
easily
a
regular
super
peppery
and
refreshing
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
the
subtle
but
different
flavors
give
it
a
lot
of
drinkability
since
youre
always
sort
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
beer
is
about
this
was
sort
of
a
different
beer
for
me
but
im
glad
i
got
it
d
a
fantastic
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
a
perfect
champagne
substitute
had
this
on
tap
at
backcounty
in
nederland
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
lacy
beige
head
the
nose
has
candy
malts
citrus
fruits
and
a
bit
of
funky
yeast
taste
is
a
bit
more
mellow
but
still
quite
good
very
well
balanced
crisp
medium
body
suits
style
would
pair
well
with
most
any
meal
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
seems
to
stick
around
forever
some
floaties
dangle
here
and
there
as
well
the
spiderweb
lacing
makes
this
a
superb
looking
brew
aroma
consists
of
banana
spicy
hops
and
strong
yeasty
goodness
sweet
floral
perfume
and
some
earth
in
the
nose
as
well
very
enjoyable
to
sniff
taste
follows
suit
very
well
but
a
touch
sweeter
sweet
apple
pear
and
rhubarb
with
a
grassy
dry
flavor
midway
some
pepper
and
clove
with
a
slight
melon
sweetness
aftertaste
is
more
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
citrus
hop
linger
very
nice
light
body
with
a
soft
pillowy
feel
and
an
active
carbonation
great
representation
of
the
style
this
saison
is
too
easy
to
drink
its
just
a
shame
i
only
got
a
small
bottle
next
time
im
getting
the
corked
750
ml
bottle
for
sure
probably
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
to
date
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
drinkable
saisonsession
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
at
10
a
bottle
it
is
an
expensive
thirst
quencher
d
split
a
750ml
with
a
friend
probably
good
as
the
carbonation
makes
it
pretty
filling
di
guess
bur
i
really
dont
like
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
d
i
wanted
more
more
more
but
i
had
to
drive
drive
drive
750ml
corked
caged
it
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
dense
effervescent
white
head
that
leaves
soft
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
butter
sharp
spice
and
a
slight
carob
very
nice
the
taste
is
dry
peppery
and
slightly
fruity
there
are
mild
earthy
tones
and
a
whisp
of
band
aid
the
whole
thing
mixes
very
well
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
slippery
and
highly
carbonated
drinkability
is
very
good
this
bottle
has
met
its
match
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
subtle
but
the
more
of
it
i
drink
the
more
it
opens
up
the
lower
abv
is
most
definitely
appreciated
and
shoots
the
drinkability
off
the
charts
d
a
good
saison
probably
would
rate
higher
if
i
hadnt
had
a
certain
saison
at
the
tasting
but
good
none
the
less
first
thought
upon
the
first
sip
far
more
vinegary
and
soapy
than
anticipated
as
i
let
it
sit
some
these
flavors
seem
to
mellow
into
the
background
a
bit
hints
of
spices
i
couldnt
begin
to
name
permeate
throughout
backed
by
pale
tart
vineyard
fruit
apple
pear
white
grape
its
crisp
dry
lightbodied
all
of
those
aspects
full
to
character
but
the
aftertaste
is
where
the
negative
aspects
rise
to
full
character
i
get
a
very
soapy
and
overly
vinegaric
finish
its
making
me
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
have
limited
experience
with
the
genre
at
hand
but
i
dont
think
these
qualities
should
be
so
present
if
it
werent
for
them
it
would
be
a
very
pleasant
slight
tartness
providing
a
sour
character
and
that
would
make
it
very
palatable
it
really
gives
a
hit
to
taste
and
drinkability
so
i
wont
deduct
them
that
low
until
i
know
whats
up
will
revise
these
scores
if
necessary
after
trying
this
beer
again
at
a
later
date
to
give
it
a
more
fair
shake
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
its
light
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
the
sediment
is
a
little
disconcerting
in
fact
i
would
have
given
it
a
higher
appearance
if
it
wasnt
for
the
sediment
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
and
i
would
enjoy
drinking
this
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
on
a
gold
winters
evening
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
not
the
best
of
this
style
ive
had
either
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
either
very
drinkable
and
a
very
standard
saison
citrus
hops
yeast
spice
earth
slightly
dry
finish
nothing
jumping
out
to
wow
me
but
a
good
beer
appearence
is
that
of
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
scent
is
creamy
and
banana
like
with
a
touch
or
coriander
and
spice
the
carbonation
content
is
quite
high
the
taste
is
the
banana
and
coriander
a
touch
of
lemon
and
some
hoppiness
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
incredibly
good
saison
probably
the
best
ive
had
drinkability
a
standard
bearer
for
the
saison
style
wonderfully
easy
to
drink
i
cant
help
but
to
take
gulp
after
gulp
deep
and
flavorful
with
a
gliding
change
in
flavor
as
it
goes
from
start
to
finish
this
one
will
please
even
the
most
arrogant
of
palates
d
drinkability
is
high
this
finishes
nice
and
clean
but
not
with
too
much
drying
effect
bear
in
mind
i
love
a
dryashell
bitter
hop
bomb
really
rather
drinkable
light
and
clean
certainly
drinkable
this
begs
to
be
drunk
at
the
height
of
summer
with
jambalaya
or
fresh
crawfish
drinkability
if
barack
obama
signs
a
bill
into
effect
where
im
paid
to
drink
this
all
day
an
interesting
beer
that
stood
out
from
the
pack
not
in
its
superiority
but
in
its
uniqueness
my
brother
rated
this
his
favorite
of
the
three
and
it
was
my
least
to
each
his
own
this
beer
poured
an
attractive
golden
color
with
a
nice
sumptuous
head
that
dissipated
slowly
nice
aroma
that
complex
mix
of
fruit
spice
and
hops
fruitness
is
balanced
by
the
hops
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
dry
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
good
beer
overall
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
that
literally
makes
me
want
to
go
run
in
a
field
of
dandelions
this
beer
has
the
imagery
of
a
beautiful
spring
day
associated
with
it
and
no
im
not
drunk
while
writing
this
well
done
brasserie
dupont
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
opaque
colored
body
with
a
big
white
head
and
decent
lacing
has
an
aroma
of
flowers
some
hops
a
subtle
aroma
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
hoegaarden
very
strong
perfume
frothy
warm
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
solo
the
drinkability
isnt
amazing
this
is
a
with
food
beer
but
even
alone
i
could
drink
a
glass
or
two
of
this
a
week
no
problem
d
extremely
easy
to
drink

overy
drinkable
strong
phenols
may
be
offensive
to
some
something
about
this
beer
reminds
me
of
orvalsansbrett
i
think
that
all
of
the
spice
in
the
beer
is
yeast
derived
but
im
not
sure
d
very
drinkable
here
cant
wait
to
bring
this
one
poolside
in
the
summer
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
patchy
lacing
citrus
yeast
pepper
and
a
musty
aroma
crisp
taste
good
amount
of
lemon
zest
pepper
and
spice
still
a
musty
overtone
that
leaves
a
metallic
bite
enjoyable
and
paired
very
well
with
seafood
this
ladies
and
gents
is
the
quintessential
farmhouse
ale
poured
with
a
grand
foamy
frothy
big
rocky
head
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
very
yeasty
citrusy
a
hint
bittersweet
spicy
peppery
flavor
is
the
same
but
bigger
commercial
description
is
accurate
does
have
a
haze
a
refreshilng
fruitiness
and
a
long
dry
finish
finish
also
is
a
bit
bitter
perfect
for
the
summer
months
as
well
as
any
freaking
time
you
want
beer
supreme
could
even
be
a
session
beer
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
more
than
on
glass
of
it
even
mrs
kdog
enjoyed
it
with
this
beer
you
need
to
let
it
sit
for
a
moment
as
it
will
get
rid
of
the
skunk
smell
and
become
the
traditional
smelling
beer
the
golden
unfiltered
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
let
sit
till
the
foam
started
to
settle
the
taste
is
amazing
as
it
gives
a
floweral
and
cloves
of
tastes
overall
an
amazing
beer
to
have
check
this
farm
house
ale
out
if
you
get
a
chance
its
great
a
favorite
like
ive
said
i
havent
experienced
many
saison
brews
although
this
one
doesnt
make
me
jump
for
joy
to
go
grab
another
it
was
worth
a
try
atleast
once
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
great
big
fluffy
head
probably
an
overvigorous
pour
very
good
retention
lots
of
herbs
on
the
nose
and
palate
also
a
dry
graininess
presents
itself
good
bitter
crispness
is
evident
and
lots
or
carbonation
for
some
undescibable
reason
i
prefer
the
organic
version
i
just
find
it
more
drinkable
der
drinkability
is
high
for
me
and
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
immensely
once
it
gets
warm
out
again
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
bas
ask
what
would
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
i
would
like
to
try
and
pair
this
up
with
some
food
at
some
point
as
ive
heard
it
can
really
shine
the
chobmichelob
the
champagne
of
beers
i
think
not
pouring
this
beer
into
into
a
small
snifter
it
can
barely
be
contained
immediately
there
is
a
large
effervescent
head
that
monopolizes
at
least
half
my
glass
until
i
find
the
right
pourtohead
ratio
so
i
dont
get
beer
all
over
my
rug
the
original
aroma
has
that
same
metallic
smell
that
all
beers
in
a
green
bottle
have
to
me
but
when
the
aggressive
tightly
laced
head
finally
calms
you
get
the
flavors
that
are
under
it
that
fruityyeastyfunky
belgium
scent
that
you
would
expect
but
drinking
it
is
a
different
story
honestly
i
can
say
this
beer
is
balanced
the
hop
flavor
is
low
but
the
bite
you
might
be
looking
for
is
supported
by
its
effervescence
it
gives
way
to
a
malty
finish
that
makes
itself
known
to
your
taste
buds
but
fades
to
a
dry
finish
and
this
beer
is
incredibly
dry
and
drinkability
well
let
me
just
tell
you
that
i
sir
am
drunk
this
single
bottle
is
so
deceptively
drinkable
that
during
the
course
of
this
review
it
has
hijacked
my
brain
because
i
have
drinking
it
like
soda
wow
those
damn
belgians
just
pulled
out
a
bottle
no
pun
intended
of
whoopass
on
me
damn
my
wife
is
going
to
be
pissed
when
she
comes
home
oh
well
this
brings
me
in
an
assbackwards
kind
of
way
to
my
next
point
which
too
me
scores
the
highest
of
honors
for
beer
every
dang
sip
tastes
the
same
and
as
fresh
as
the
first
i
find
this
rare
in
a
beer
and
worth
mentioning
man
thank
god
i
have
spell
check
or
anyone
reading
this
review
would
be
in
a
world
of
hurt
right
now
anyway
do
get
this
beer
your
most
crazy
hoppy
flavorful
beer
no
in
a
class
of
its
own
for
being
both
simple
and
amazing
yes
my
god
yes
d
this
was
a
little
disappointing
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
in
terms
of
flavor
it
was
just
a
little
odd
drinkability
is
good
very
refreshing
would
drink
that
mainly
during
hot
day
375
ml
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
aroma
smells
like
tropical
fruit
cloves
earth
and
some
belgian
funk
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
some
spicy
hops
citrus
and
bready
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
crisp
has
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
good
too
its
enjoyable
to
drink
and
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
with
no
problem
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
saison
id
definitely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
recommended
750ml
bottle
year
2007
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
blonde
with
thick
foamy
bubbly
head
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
the
first
thing
i
smell
is
the
spice
then
the
fruit
comes
through
i
also
get
a
hint
of
cloves
in
there
its
a
complex
aroma
feels
a
bit
bubbly
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
easy
its
got
a
tart
taste
as
well
as
spicy
peppers
with
some
bitterness
seems
pretty
dry
too
its
a
well
balanced
flavor
drinks
real
easy
and
is
quite
enjoyable
saison
dupont
was
decanted
into
an
ommegang
goblet
and
came
out
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
lovely
pillow
like
white
head
smell
has
citrus
fruit
such
as
lemons
and
oranges
hints
of
earth
and
soil
and
a
mild
bit
of
funk
taste
has
more
earthy
funk
some
cheese
ash
bitterness
grapefruit
more
spicy
pepper
overall
very
complex
flavors
mouthfeel
starts
off
with
a
heavy
carbonation
that
starts
off
rather
sweet
and
changes
course
to
leave
the
palate
on
a
dry
and
bitter
note
good
drinking
with
this
beer
i
could
go
through
a
bottle
very
easily
this
is
a
great
conversation
piece
of
a
beer
and
amongst
the
best
for
the
style
went
well
with
some
lamb
tips
cheers
pours
a
very
clear
slightly
orange
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
sediment
from
an
inattentive
pour
my
own
fault
with
almost
2
fingers
of
rocky
white
head
that
never
seems
to
fade
aroma
is
complex
lots
of
citrus
fruits
a
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
like
the
aroma
ctirus
fruits
spicy
hops
lightly
tart
dry
the
fruits
are
dominate
and
more
more
complex
and
layered
than
my
simple
description
of
citrus
can
encompass
mouthfeel
is
good
light
body
high
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
only
subtle
hints
of
alcohol
drinkability
is
quite
good
very
complex
and
intriguing
after
each
sip
i
cannot
wait
for
the
next
the
bottle
is
gone
far
too
quickly
next
time
ill
buy
a
bigger
bottle
note
so
i
tried
to
avoid
getting
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
into
my
cup
but
i
got
greedy
and
spilled
just
a
bit
in
there
im
not
really
sure
how
im
supposed
to
enjoy
this
beer
yeast
or
not
so
if
somebody
knows
please
bm
me
a
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
me
dont
know
that
id
session
this
but
its
definitely
an
interesting
and
pleasing
beer
d
this
is
one
worth
coming
back
to
again
overall
a
nice
saison
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
so
long
and
i
think
my
expectation
for
it
was
too
high
as
it
didnt
meet
it
i
certainly
do
like
it
and
think
its
a
good
saison
but
i
think
there
are
some
out
there
that
i
tend
to
favor
more
light
with
lots
of
sparkly
carbonation
this
is
another
great
saison
for
hotter
nights
in
australia
d
complex
angular
not
for
quaffing
but
for
savouring
modestly
d
cant
get
past
the
detergent
taste
doesnt
seem
right
for
the
style
maybe
a
bad
batch
will
have
to
try
it
again
someday
d
a
great
drink
for
the
summer
time
easy
to
consume
and
like
great
tasting
drinking
beer
that
is
a
complete
classic
saison
dupont
is
supposed
to
be
sturdy
enough
to
take
some
aging
but
refreshing
enough
to
drink
as
a
summer
quencher
in
my
opinion
6
5
is
too
high
an
abv
for
this
task
and
the
aspirin
quality
is
a
bit
over
the
top
for
any
season
not
bad
but
not
something
that
id
want
to
drink
very
often
at
7
49
a
bottle
i
guess
thats
fortunate
grassy
and
just
a
touch
hoppy
with
sweetness
and
that
great
nose
good
stuff
when
its
cared
for
properly
this
is
a
thrill
to
drink
and
i
was
nearly
thrilled
this
time
nearly
i
certainly
didnt
recoil
as
i
sometimes
do
with
saison
dupont
i
have
had
this
several
times
on
draft
and
none
of
them
were
as
memorable
or
as
good
as
this
bottle
the
drinkability
on
both
is
nice
but
i
would
defintly
rather
have
the
bottle
dif
i
could
buy
a
keg
i
would
try
one
you
wont
be
dissapointed
what
a
wonderful
drop
of
beer
surely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
refreshing
brews
ive
ever
tasted
a
truly
delectable
and
extremely
tasty
beer
wonderful
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
great
example
of
that
this
style
can
be
prosit
mk
though
there
are
many
saisons
out
there
and
almost
as
many
good
ones
i
can
see
how
this
is
the
standardbearer
for
the
style
highly
recommended
great
example
of
a
saison
perfect
for
summer
as
the
style
was
intended
for
d
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
belgian
saison
crisp
applelike
with
a
certain
bitterness
that
is
not
overbearing
although
this
is
a
quality
ale
i
have
other
favs
that
i
would
likely
buy
before
this
pours
a
nice
bright
hay
color
into
my
tulip
the
head
is
white
and
thin
with
very
large
bubbles
and
doesnt
last
long
the
smell
is
pastoral
clover
and
grass
and
clay
with
some
notes
of
honey
and
peony
taste
comes
on
sweet
and
floral
with
a
sharp
mineral
tang
to
the
finish
the
yeast
is
very
subtle
though
rich
its
quite
an
active
beer
in
the
mouth
leaving
a
good
bit
of
foam
to
swallow
after
you
think
youre
done
but
feels
very
nice
going
down
the
alcohol
edge
isnt
too
pronounced
its
easy
to
drink
a
few
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
what
a
great
saison
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
d
drinkable
yet
so
intense
and
complex
as
to
be
slightly
offputting
definitely
an
enjoyable
experience
mouthfeel
is
very
very
carbonated
and
crisp
cant
stop
burping
drinkability
is
great
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
it
could
be
a
good
anytime
beer
this
is
entirely
drinkable
and
absolutely
enjoyable
saison
is
a
style
that
im
beginning
to
consider
as
my
new
favorite
especially
when
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
experience
fantastic
samples
like
this
one
highly
recommended
wow
this
is
my
second
ever
saison
my
first
was
barking
duck
which
i
tried
before
getting
into
craft
beer
and
i
was
unable
to
drink
it
not
sure
what
i
would
make
of
the
matilda
bay
brew
now
but
dupont
is
certainly
a
very
good
beer
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
but
very
tasty
and
good
value
at
11
for
the
750ml
bottle
overall
simply
a
very
good
complex
ale
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
just
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
its
like
drinking
a
duvel
crossed
with
a
heineken
cloudy
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
aromas
of
lemongrass
and
gentle
grainy
malt
with
a
dash
of
earth
and
yeast
tastes
like
gritty
barley
and
wheat
with
a
mild
spicy
earthiness
that
goes
well
with
its
soft
malty
mouth
feel
mild
earthy
and
fruity
finish
with
another
dash
of
yeast
pours
a
clouded
gold
with
a
white
head
funky
and
smooth
nose
flavor
is
a
magnificent
combo
of
yeast
citrus
and
funk
its
beautiful
feel
has
a
smooth
liquid
end
and
the
carbonation
has
a
bit
of
a
sharp
bite
overall
smooth
though
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
the
standard
for
saisons
dont
know
the
reason
try
it
and
youll
see
poured
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
into
a
saison
dupont
glass
a
whipped
cream
head
develops
and
reaches
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
hazy
pale
orangeyellow
with
sparkling
carbonation
bubbles
and
many
fine
particulates
floating
around
aroma
of
banana
and
a
dry
yeasty
funky
sourness
taste
is
tart
hints
of
banana
and
spice
slightly
warming
from
the
alcohol
fills
the
belly
with
joy
goes
down
super
smooth
despite
the
high
carbonation
a
delicious
farmhouse
ale
refreshing
and
highly
recommended
yummy
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
good
flavor
and
low
alcohol
make
this
beer
easy
to
consume
and
enjoy
at
length
pours
deep
golden
opaquecloudy
orange
with
a
fluffybillowing
white
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
citrus
sweet
with
a
surprising
kick
of
hops
flavor
is
sweet
citrus
yeast
and
herbs
finishes
with
a
nice
kick
of
yeast
in
the
sinus
and
a
dry
hoppy
throat
medium
body
with
great
lacing
definitely
my
favorite
saison
great
for
the
warm
spring
and
summer
months
this
is
what
a
saison
should
taste
like
the
benchmark
in
my
opinion
of
any
american
or
belgianfrench
attempts
at
this
style
very
well
executed
could
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
to
my
detriment
i
am
sure
crisp
aroma
is
rich
and
fruity
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
it
pours
out
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
flavor
is
fruity
and
crisp
with
hints
of
malt
and
just
a
trace
of
hops
texture
is
lively
jazzy
and
jagged
it
fairly
dances
on
the
tongue
and
on
its
way
down
the
pipes
for
the
price
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
good
light
beer
easy
to
enjoy
without
feeling
overpowering
refreshing
approachable
affordable
thirst
quenching
certainly
worth
revisiting
again
d
great
example
of
saison
and
very
enjoyabledrinkable
but
not
my
favorite
recommended
for
style
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
but
i
think
the
green
bottle
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
i
just
cant
figure
out
why
anyone
would
use
a
green
bottle
when
we
all
know
that
it
does
the
beer
harm
d
this
is
my
answer
for
if
you
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
your
life
linked
up
nicely
with
the
seafood
quesodilla
i
was
having
at
the
time
d
rather
drinkable
but
perhaps
not
as
refreshing
as
hennepin
still
a
solid
saison
though
this
beautiful
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
extremely
good
head
retention
and
belgian
lacing
there
is
some
light
pepper
and
citrus
aroma
and
an
earthy
bready
belgian
yeast
aroma
the
flavors
replicate
the
aroma
and
this
beer
really
is
a
world
class
example
of
the
style
it
is
decidedly
on
the
dry
side
but
with
an
excellent
palate
profile
of
pepper
citrus
and
honey
the
beer
has
a
fairly
good
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
wheat
in
it
its
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
refreshing
paired
with
some
bigholed
swiss
and
indian
tandoori
bread
the
bitter
edge
of
the
cheese
works
well
with
the
similarly
bitter
edge
of
the
beer
the
two
make
one
another
taste
so
much
better
and
the
bread
is
just
good
really
i
cant
recall
swiss
ever
tasting
so
good
md
smooth
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
contained
well
decent
drinkability
a
good
saison
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
good
notes
this
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
better
than
the
cynicale
that
i
had
earlier
today
in
that
its
a
lot
more
delicate
and
nuanced
good
stuff
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
big
head
of
white
foam
the
thick
lacing
clung
to
the
glass
as
a
small
amount
of
sediment
danced
in
the
ample
carbonation
the
smell
was
a
yeastybready
aroma
with
hints
of
pear
green
apple
fresh
cut
grass
and
spice
this
ale
had
a
slight
taste
of
sourdough
bread
followed
by
a
slightly
citric
frutiness
it
finished
off
dry
and
slightly
bitter
excellent
example
of
this
style
of
farmhouse
ale
d
a
beautifully
balanced
saison
that
for
whatever
reason
i
found
incredibly
hard
to
pin
down
and
describe
very
drinkable
i
imagine
it
would
pair
wonderfully
with
a
wide
array
of
food
a
must
try
drinkability
strong
pours
cloudy
bright
gold
with
a
huge
everlasting
fluffy
white
head
spicy
yeasty
earthy
aroma
lemons
and
apples
spicy
as
well
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
some
spiciness
fruit
and
earthy
flavors
coming
through
finishes
dry
with
some
herbal
hoppiness
well
balanced
and
quite
complex
above
all
really
delicious
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
amazingly
drinkable
i
love
this
one
an
awesome
beer
750ml
has
anyone
ever
confused
this
with
a
hefeweizen
color
and
palate
seem
very
similar
ive
had
this
beer
plenty
of
times
but
my
1st
rating
of
it
when
the
beer
is
in
front
of
me
aroma
is
captivating
some
slight
bitter
and
off
flavors
on
the
finish
floral
hay
summer
day
in
the
mountains
cool
refreshing
type
of
beer
yet
still
showing
a
lot
of
hops
could
see
how
this
could
be
considered
the
model
all
other
saisons
are
produced
from
there
is
a
weight
and
concentration
i
cant
remember
any
other
saison
having
i
believe
the
cork
was
branded
with
the
year
2008
very
nice
feature
d
fullflavored
yet
still
subtle
very
complex
great
example
of
the
style
easy
to
see
why
it
has
such
a
great
reputation
overall
a
great
tasty
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
cant
wait
to
get
another
bottle
md
chewy
and
crisp
feel
very
easy
drinking
beer
after
looking
at
the
other
reviews
people
ive
seen
a
lot
of
funk
taste
flying
around
so
i
am
curious
about
that
having
this
one
chilled
from
a
green
bomber
in
my
duvel
bubbler
aromas
of
banana
coriander
lemon
zest
and
orange
peel
waft
into
my
nazel
cavities
taste
isnt
too
funky
maybe
i
could
trick
my
mind
by
picturing
a
barnyard
but
not
much
of
a
petting
zoo
taste
im
getting
some
earthy
tastes
like
a
bordeaux
and
then
the
wit
beer
quality
comes
out
but
thats
about
it
a
nice
brew
good
and
summery
cheers
as
effervescent
in
initial
mouthfeel
as
it
was
in
appearance
becoming
wellrounded
fullbodied
but
not
overwhelming
crisp
and
complex
taste
throughout
with
notes
i
hadnt
detected
in
the
nose
unsurprisingly
given
how
much
there
is
to
smell
and
taste
in
this
farmhouse
ale
fruit
with
some
nice
tartness
and
grain
hops
also
not
to
be
ignored
really
nice
effort
last
night
after
dinner
we
chose
another
saison
to
try
this
evening
i
will
be
back
for
more
dupont
later
this
summer
pours
a
superhazed
glowing
orange
color
big
fluffy
white
head
slowly
dissipates
and
leaves
pretty
good
lacing
on
the
glass
lots
and
lots
of
tiny
floaties
roaming
around
smells
spicy
earthen
some
faint
lemon
and
pepper
great
aromas
on
this
beer
taste
is
wheaty
some
pear
and
citrus
more
pepper
some
slight
bitter
lemon
really
refreshing
incredibly
crisp
and
dry
really
hitting
the
spot
on
a
muggy
july
night
seems
like
a
really
good
representation
of
the
style
a
total
classic
and
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
highly
rated
d
a
very
tasty
very
refreshing
saison
6
5abv
is
a
bit
high
to
make
it
a
session
beer
but
a
few
on
a
hot
summers
day
wouldnt
be
out
of
order
then
again
tonight
is
a
cold
winter
night
and
its
still
pretty
good
after
reading
about
the
saison
ales
in
the
latest
edition
of
beer
advocate
i
decided
that
i
had
to
try
some
the
most
prominent
of
the
saison
ales
is
this
one
saison
dupont
and
now
i
know
why
poured
a
golden
orange
into
my
leffe
chalice
with
noticeable
yeast
particles
unfiltered
indeed
the
head
was
at
least
two
fingers
and
it
was
retained
throghout
the
taste
is
fruitful
and
enjoyable
crisp
clean
taste
gives
way
to
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
out
again
on
my
next
trip
to
my
beer
store
this
beer
is
so
good
how
good
is
it
this
beer
is
so
good
you
should
drink
it
a
hazy
orangish
yellow
ale
huge
white
head
lacing
and
quite
effervensent
aroma
of
spice
yeast
and
notes
of
citrus
lemon
flavor
of
fresh
dough
spice
and
esters
from
yeast
dry
finish
and
light
body
makes
this
a
refreshing
and
incredibly
quafable
ale
its
a
wonderful
summer
ale
at
6
5
abv
being
bone
dry
and
relatively
light
bodied
it
hits
my
sweet
spot
edit
from
12311
no
change
in
score
but
the
beer
is
on
tap
at
maxs
today
and
the
bartender
jason
served
me
a
32
ounce
glass
of
this
beer
thatll
surely
never
happen
again
and
i
thought
that
by
itself
was
deserving
of
a
short
note
ive
been
reluctant
to
splurge
for
the
750
ml
bottle
in
stores
but
i
might
have
to
and
bring
it
to
a
party
where
white
wine
drinkers
and
some
shellfish
might
be
served
i
put
my
money
on
the
dupont
wonderfully
drinkable
saison
dupont
is
light
flavorful
and
finishes
clean
drinkability
great
soft
finish
slightly
on
the
chalky
side
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
could
drink
this
damn
near
all
night
i
enjoyed
every
drop
and
will
gladly
come
back
for
more
highly
recommended
saison
dupont
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
fizzy
white
head
it
smells
of
yeast
pear
citrus
sour
hops
and
a
hint
of
champagne
the
taste
is
complexhops
pear
citrus
and
herbal
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
it
almost
burns
the
inside
of
your
mouth
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
can
leave
quite
an
impression
but
maybe
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
my
first
saison
and
im
not
disappointed
in
the
least
a
delicious
beer
d
lowmoderate
abv
slightly
dry
somewhat
tart
i
think
12
of
these
in
a
session
would
do
just
fine
probably
not
more
the
hard
edges
soften
on
the
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
really
smooths
out
as
the
beers
warms
a
tad
great
beer
on
what
was
a
112f

for
some
many
occasions

finish
is
dry
crisp
very
smooth
not
much
lingering
flavor
but
its
very
pleasant
with
the
high
carbonation
balancing
beautifully
the
relatively
full
body
recommended
d
very
smooth
and
not
nearly
as
intense
as
the
smell
would
suggest
fairly
crisp
and
full
of
great
savory
flavors
somewhat
unusual
for
any
beer
much
softer
than
its
american
cousin
hennepin
had
this
beer
with
a
meal
of
grilled
salmon
and
shrimp
at
scutra
in
arlington
ma
an
excellent
beer
and
restaurant
for
the
meal
and
for
the
warm
summer
night
on
which
both
were
consumed
the
waitress
poured
the
beer
straight
into
the
bottom
of
a
tall
glass
which
created
a
massive
head
that
erupted
with
a
bready
fruity
aroma
the
head
dissolved
quickly
except
for
the
final
inch
the
color
of
the
beer
is
hazy
yelloworange
which
is
quite
beautiful
the
initial
carbonation
stings
a
bit
and
then
disappears
leaving
behind
the
flavors
of
clove
peaches
apples
and
wholewheat
bread
a
bit
of
bitterness
follows
alcohol
was
lower
than
i
expected
so
having
two
was
not
a
problem
drinking
this
saison
was
absolute
delight
drinkability
drinks
like
a
4abv
beer
great
beer
for
texas
summers
d
very
light
refreshing
and
drinkable
nice
summer
beer
especially
when
paired
with
stronger
foods
a
little
sour
on
the
end
perhaps
i
cellared
this
one
too
long
will
have
to
try
another
a
superb
example
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
goes
beyond
being
a
tasty
beverage
and
can
transport
you
to
the
farmhouses
of
belgium
a
great
treat
to
drink
in
the
backyard
on
a
starry
summer
night
i
would
recommend
as
a
must
try
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
d
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
the
earthy
and
spicy
notes
blend
well
with
the
herbal
hop
character
a
true
classic

750ml
bottle
into
a
very
large
red

glass
careful
pour
yields
a
nice
3
finger
pure
white
head
with
very
nice
retention
as
head
diminishes
leaves
a
moderate

pours
a
very
nice
almost
transparent

of
light

slight

a

hints

nice

bitterness
in

finishes
very
dry
which
is
nice
on
a
hot
day
i
was
expecting
some
slight
fruit
esters
however
none
have
come
through
solid
mouthfeel
not
too
thin
or
cloying
drinkablity
is
also
solid
as
this
is
not
a
heavy
beer
or
overly
alcoholic
over
all
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
as
reflected
in
my
rating
and
serves
as
a
solid
introduction
to
a
brewer
i
have
not
previously
sampled
i
will
be
looking
for
more
dupont
products
in
the
future
d
i
love
this
beer
enough
said
d
i
am
sure
i
will
get
me
some
again
i
did
like
it
i
would
hope
that
they
make
some
smaller
bottles
2
darker
bottle
to
prevent
uv
light
damage
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
a
world
classic
paired
tonight
with
grilled
spring
chinook
oysters
and
asparagus
perfect
still
i
generally
prefer
the
fruitier
saisons
then
the
pepper
of
dupont
i
will
say
it
again
just
beautiful
and
what
every
saison
should
be
a
style
and
beer
that
i
have
been
incredibly
intrigued
with
from
the
beginning
and
that
obsession
still
continues
a
masterpiece
definately
a
great
saison
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
what
a
refreshing
and
amazingly
drinkable
beer
seems
like
a
perfect
companion
for
a
hot
summer
day
will
buy
again
375ml
bottle
very
cloudy
yellow
lots
of
head
and
lacing
smell
is
very
light
malt
bread
candy
sugar
lemon
citrus
lots
of
yeast
taste
is
pretty
similar
lots
of
citrus
herbs
very
light
malt
yeasty
some
interesting
dry
bitterness
at
the
finish
very
coarse
high
carbonation
all
in
all
this
is
just
an
incredibly
clean
crisp
refreshing
farmhouse
ale
great
beer
for
hot
weather
i
had
this
with
a
salmon
and
warm
vinaigrette
salad
and
it
went
perfect
i
imagine
it
would
be
good
with
many
light
foods
this
is
a
very
good
saison
but
i
think
i
will
stick
with
hennepin
i
definitely
recommend
it
though
this
is
a
good
farmhouse
saison
and
probably
the
best
session
one
of
the
bunch
upgrading
my
rating
after
having
this
on
tap
at
the
back
abbey
in
claremont
ca
came
served
in
a
nice
little
saison
dupont
glass
probably
about
1012oz
worth
the
taste
was
even
better
and
refreshing
from
what
i
remembered
for
the
bottle
i
had
and
the
mouthfeel
was
about
as
good
as
i
think
it
could
be
just
really
enjoyed
this
on
tap
d
the
only
thing
that
reduces
the
session
characteristics
of
this
one
for
me
is
the
huge
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
easily
my
favorite
sunny
weather
beer
and
might
just
be
my
favorite
beer
overall
im
amazed
with
it
every
time
i
stuff
my
nose
down
in
the
glass
for
another
sip
try
this
alongside
a
good
homemade
or
otherwise
crawfish
étouffée
or
other
flavourful
cajun
cuisine
also
with
thai
food
anything
with
peanut
sauce
and
lime
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
the
pairing
overall
due
to
the
cleansing
feel
probably
great
with
food
not
spectacular
but
still
good
appearance
is
golden
in
color
with
a
thick
head
smell
has
an
deep
earthiness
to
it
with
spice
and
citrus
taste
is
earthy
light
with
a
big
hit
of
carbonation
with
a
bitter
saline
aftertaste
reminding
me
of
a
club
soda
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
not
what
i
really
expected
but
still
a
good
experience
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
saisons
are
a
quirky
style
and
dupont
has
done
well
with
this
one
golden
brew
carefully
poured
raises
an
astonishingly
gigantic
rocky
chunky
head
of
foam
that
recedes
slowly
lac
everywhere
beautiful
aromas
are
fantastic
a
lemonyherbalspicy
kaleidoscope
of
aromas
hit
of
funk
wonderful
crisply
effervescent
and
light
on
the
tongue
just
a
gorgeous
fantastically
drinkable
refreshing
and
crisp
yet
beguilingly
complex
brew
lemons
apples
chamomile
coriander
wheat
grass
a
lovely
interplay
of
sweetness
up
front
giving
way
to
a
dance
between
tartness
and
bitterness
that
makes
the
palate
sing
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
am
so
happy
to
finally
try
this
it
wont
be
my
last
d
well
if
i
could
afford
it
i
would
never
stop
drinking
it
but
then
i
would
become
500
pound
in
a
few
months
so
i
guess
it
is
a
good
thing
this
thing
is
10
bucks
a
bottle
a
crisp
bitterness
and
slightly
fruity
pepperlike
flavors
are
found
in
this
belgian
ale
fairly
lightbodied
saison
dupont
is
my
choice
as
a
favorite
beer
to
quaff
while
sitting
on
my
balcony
on
a
warm
summer
day
a
very
dry
crisp
ale
with
a
dry
finish
that
always
leaves
you
wanting
some
more
the
addition
of
wheat
makes
the
beer
a
bit
smooth
despite
the
high
carbonation
a
rare
classic
from
belgium
that
should
be
savored
the
pour
is
the
color
of
pale
hazy
golden
hay
with
a
large
and
finely
fluffy
cloud
white
top
funky
fruity
and
phenolic
smelling
with
hints
of
flowery
sweetness
dynamite
mouthfeel
full
of
fine
tickling
carbonation
the
taste
has
a
soft
sweetness
upfront
with
tart
applepear
fruitiness
yeasty
and
funky
with
a
peppery
spice
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
lingers
for
just
a
bit
in
the
finish
very
good
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
one
d
the
hype
is
justified
i
will
go
a
long
way
off
the
beaten
path
for
more
of
this
fine
ale
d
a
light
tasty
beer
that
would
go
well
with
food
or
as
an
after
work
drink
to
relax
with
d
an
outstandingly
refreshing
beer
for
a
warm
day
this
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
that
goes
well
with
a
wide
range
of
foods
im
pairing
it
with
spicy
turkey
sausage
d
while
this
tends
to
lean
towards
a
little
nicer
to
drink
i
think
id
prefer
it
as
a
sipper
over
swigging
notes
i
like
this
but
its
not
a
staple
in
the
fridge
id
buy
another
single
of
it
but
it
wont
be
for
a
while
i
think
jps
bam
biere
was
a
bigger
hit
with
me
overall
i
was
hoping
for
alot
more
probably
pretty
good
underneath
but
just
doesnt
work
d
not
bad
from
a
bottle
this
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
nice
foamy
head
and
good
lacing
big
nose
of
citrus
floral
hops
and
spices
rich
and
delicious
mouthfeel
favors
are
wonderful
with
citrus
flowers
fruit
and
hops
slightly
sour
finish
fantastic
brew
very
nice
overall
again
not
my
fav
style
but
given
the
givens
pours
a
flat
golden
color
with
a
huge
pillowlike
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
sweet
sugary
candies
slight
hops
and
some
funkiness
the
taste
is
more
complex
tart
fruits
grapes
lemon
orange
definite
funk
and
just
enough
hops
to
accompany
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
it
has
a
light
body
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
great
beer
definitely
an
outstanding
saison
not
bad
but
i
expected
a
better
experience
my
question
of
whats
so
great
about
farmhouse
ale
remains
unanswered
at
this
point
a
three
finger
plus
off
white
head
easily
reaches
the
rim
of
the
glass
without
effort
the
body
is
a
hazy
dark
golden
straw
colored
hue
a
breakup
of
lace
is
left
around
the
glass
as
the
lace
receeds
nose
has
distinct
piney
notes
stacked
on
top
of
fresh
wheat
notes
and
noticeable
hop
characteristics
yeasty
fruit
laced
notes
are
also
there
at
first
sip
you
get
a
slight
instense
of
sour
that
quickly
yields
to
a
mineral
and
spicey
balance
that
is
all
over
the
tongue
very
crisp
and
well
rounded
with
lots
of
fresh
veggie
notes
all
wraped
around
nice
dry
fruity
tones
dryness
is
inhanced
by
a
soft
hop
profile
and
slight
bitterness
this
beer
gets
even
more
mellow
and
much
better
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
oh
so
drinkable
the
more
i
drink
good
saisons
the
more
i
like
them
this
one
is
very
very
good
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
have
been
enjoying
more
as
of
late
this
one
was
great
with
garlic
mussels
and
the
perfect
match
easily
could
have
several
in
a
sitting
as
it
doesnt
become
boring
summertime
would
be
good
for
this
one
yelloworange
with
slight
haze

of
carbonation

every
moment
certainly
very
well
recommended
taste
estery
with
flavors
of
banana
and
pineapple
light
acidity
with
a
subtle
spiciness
notes
of
citrus
come
out
more
as
the
beer
sits
in
the
mouth
extremely
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
lemon
peellike
bitterness
that
remains
on
the
palate
for
several
minutes
as
perhaps
one
of
the
most
widely
known
depictions
of
the
saison
style
copped
this
11
2
oz
brew
singly
from
garys
in
madison
what
an
amazing
sample
this
is
a
worldclass
topnotch
brew
true
to
the
style
and
above
and
beyond
the
average
by
far
superb
hazy
cloudy
appearance
with
impressive
foamy
head
that
had
some
staying
power
smell
was
full
of
fresh
citrus
and
a
powerful
sweet
aroma
taste
was
complete
with
grapefruits
lemon
and
a
wonderful
lucid
crisp
clear
taste
that
delivered
and
left
little
to
be
desired
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
sampled
full
of
chracter
quality
and
style
definitely
a
musttry
this
beer
commands
respect
and
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
definitely
recommended
this
went
down
quite
easily
and
i
can
see
this
going
well
with
many
other
types
of
food
especially
anything
with
a
little
spice
or
on
a
nice
warm
day
d
it
was
an
easy
sipper
it
had
an
interesting
flavor
yet
was
quite
refreshing
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
would
eventually
have
to
switch
styles
to
something
very
bitter
since
the
belgian
styles
arent
my
favorite
but
i
enjoy
having
a
few
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
they
arent
usually
as
strong
so
i
can
have
a
few
in
a
row
very
tasty
i
will
grab
a
4
pack
next
time
im
out
taste
of
anise
and
cork
interesting
a
lot
of
tastes
that
are
hard
to
describe
spicy
with
hints
of
clove
and
cinnamon
i
am
not
sure
the
hops
are
very
much
in
balance
with
the
yeast
and
malt
a
nice
gentle
bitterness
comes
in
after
the
yeast
and
complements
the
beer
super
balance
and
complex
very
refreshing
beer
as
we
say
fris
en
fruitig
fresh
and
fruity
yes
they
are
drinkable
fully
hazed
orange
i
couldnt
avoid
pouring
the
yeast
fluffy
frothy
white
head
leaves
some
nice
rings
on
the
glass
as
it
drops
to
a
thick
whipped
topping
the
nose
is
herbal
spicy
yeast
and
a
powdery
sweetness
dried
bananas
yellow
cake
and
a
hint
of
incense
perfectly
belgian
flavors
of
bitter
orange
and
light
fruity
yeast
leafy
hops
and
gentle
sweetness
mediumlight
bodied
smooth
seemingly
getting
creamier
as
its
sits
in
the
glass
classic
belgian
beer
all
around
a
great
choice
anytime
very
drinkable
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
especially
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
foamy
one
finger
head
this
beer
smells
crisp
and
clean
with
a
tart
green
apple
finish
the
taste
is
dry
and
has
a
mild
astringent
taste
despite
this
this
beer
would
be
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
hot
summer
day
as
traditionally
intended
even
though
i
am
drinking
it
on
a
cold
day
in
january
the
crispness
of
this
beer
is
seriously
impressive
the
carbonation
is
soft
and
provides
a
mellowness
to
compliment
the
borderline
sourness
of
the
beer
the
body
is
light
this
beer
goes
down
very
nicely
however
the
astringent
and
sour
tastes
create
a
struggle
on
some
gulps
very
good
beer
i
remember
having
this
fresh
and
from
what
i
can
tell
not
very
much
has
happened
it
still
tastes
great
and
makes
for
an
excellent
thirstquencher
or
a
pairing
with
some
spicy
food
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
come
across
recommended
dgood
drinkability
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
would
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
clean
crisp
and
has
good
quality
flavors
there
isnt
really
anything
i
would
criticize
about
this
beer
at
all
d
refreshing

beer
poured
a
beautiful
cloudy
pale
yellow
body
that
produced
a
large
foamy
white
head
nose
is
a
great
blend
of
belgian
yeast
fruity
citrus
and
floral
hops
taste
is
dominant
of
belgian
yeast
upfront
with
fruity
citrus
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
extremely
smooth
it
is
nicely
carbonated
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
had
3
of
these
in
my
cellar
figured
id
pop
one
and
see
how
its
going
poured
into
and
oversize
wine
glass
in
the
bottle
this
appeared
much
clearer
than
my
07
s
in
the
glass
it
is
similar
except
that
the
head
is
twice
the
size
and
stays
that
way
much
skunkier
spicier
smell
than
07
also
much
more
carbonated
the
cork
hit
the
ceiling
the
nose
is
absolutely
dilectable
for
a
farmhouse
saison
sweet
spicy
fruity
nose
the
first
sip
is
very
fruity
and
smooth
the
hop
taste
follows
with
almost
a
coriander
fruit
taste
and
spicy
tones
with
slightly
skunky
mixtures
it
is
in
a
green
bottle
the
finish
has
reduced
in
bitterness
with
its
two
years
of
age
the
mouthfeel
is
silkier
than
fresh
bottles
and
the
carbonation
is
more
intense
drinkability
is
very
good
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
fine
saison
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
has
a
little
bit
malt
to
complement
the
earthy
yeast
flavor
it
is
a
little
dry
in
the
mouth
similar
to
a
chardonnay
overall
a
darn
complex
beer
for
a
tyro
like
myself
but
very
enjoyable
and
will
buy
again
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
definitely
not
impressed
by
mouthfeel
either
very
low
carbonation
feels
almost
flat
in
the
mouth
not
very
pleasing
this
is
one
i
might
buy
again
if
only
to
give
it
a
second
chance
ill
be
sure
to
get
it
from
a
place
where
i
can
see
that
it
is
stored
properly
from
what
i
can
tell
now
this
brew
isnt
all
that
great
not
much
flavor
and
its
not
all
that
great
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
glad
that
ive
had
hennepin
before
this
because
if
this
were
the
first
of
the
style
id
ever
tasted
id
be
turned
off
to
it
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
ever
had
and
its
tasty
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
damn
fine
one
d
this
is
a
great
saison
and
i
am
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
i
will
certainly
have
it
again
when
i
come
across
it
again
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
styleat
a
near
sessionable
abv
the
appearance
tartness
and
mouthfeel
may
have
a
staunch
wine
lover
considering
a
bottle
or
two
saison
dupont
and
broiled
shrimp
are
a
solid
pairing
one
must
pour
this
beer
unhurriedly
otherwise
it
will
get
a
huge
head
that
lingers
forever
it
poured
a
fantastic
deep
yellowamber
with
plenty
of
constant
fizz
i
smelled
some
citrus
and
took
a
sip
very
bubbly
in
the
mouth
but
pleasant
tasted
zesty
with
a
little
pepper
and
apple
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
wild
yeast
flavors
like
i
have
tasted
in
the
ommegang
omeggeddon
but
they
were
very
mild
this
beer
is
really
wellbalanced
and
leaves
your
palette
fairly
quickly
making
you
want
more
excellent
drinkability
supreme
drinkability
and
wonderfully
refreshing
poured
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
and
luscious
white
head
be
careful
with
your
pour
and
beautiful
belgian
lacing
which
adhered
to
the
glass
throughout
the
entire
session
floral
smell
with
the
presence
of
clove
wheat
and
hops
somewhat
thin
but
not
unpleasant
mouthfeel
surprisingly
little
effervescence
in
the
mouth
considering
the
head
taste
of
cloves
corriander
and
more
floralherbal
undertones
slightly
bitter
finish
would
make
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
overall
a
great
selection
especially
while
watching
the
sox
beat
the
rox
d
so
well
done
its
easy
to
enjoy
a
750ml
and
feel
satisfied
and
refreshed
nice
to
not
be
knocked
off
my
feet
as
some
of
the
higher
abv
boundry
pushing
beers
are
wont
to
do
great
stuff
its
not
overly
extreme
or
complicated
but
it
does
have
depth
and
excellent
drinkability
this
would
be
most
heavenly
after
doing
some
hard
physical
labor
in
the
summertime
but
ill
take
it
on
a
chilly
autumn
day
like
today
or
just
about
anytime
final
note
i
can
see
how
drinking
too
many
beers
like
this
might
turn
one
into
a
beer
snob
but
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
a
750ml
bottle
with
2
2007
stamped
on
the
cork
an
orange
color
with
a
beautiful
thick
white
head
fruity
aroma
mostly
apple
a
little
yeast
also
a
nice
fruity
taste
again
the
yeast
and
a
dry
somewhat
bitter
finish
a
good
session
beer
fun
to
drink
beer
pours
a
pale
grainy
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
that
leaves
thick
lacing
i
decided
to
let
the
beer
warm
up
before
trying
it
aroma
is
rich
and
spicy
with
faint
hints
of
raisin
taste
is
very
light
at
first
with
only
the
spice
and
raisin
showing
through
goes
down
smooth
a
second
sip
confirms
the
smoothness
and
maltiness
i
feel
that
the
beer
isnt
as
strong
as
i
hoped
and
it
just
seems
unimpressive
to
me
not
bad
but
ill
definitely
revisit
down
the
road
this
makes
for
a
decent
session
i
expected
a
little
more
i
actually
found
a
bottle
of
this
after
i
had
traded
for
it
so
ill
try
the
traded
version
after
this
and
see
if
it
is
any
different
anyway
this
beer
pours
a
slighly
cloudy
mediumgolden
into
a
small
sinha
glass
huge
fluffy
head
that
i
have
to
fight
to
prevent
it
from
overflowing
pretty
decent
looking
in
fact
aroma
is
restrained
mildly
sour
and
fruity
very
little
of
that
barnyard
flavour
id
been
expecting
and
more
spicy
mouthfeel
is
much
more
light
and
spritzy
than
i
remembered
and
that
may
be
the
biggest
disappointment
flavour
is
peppery
spicy
mildly
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
lemon
but
none
of
the
funk
i
want
to
see
in
a
farmhouse
ale
still
its
fairly
refreshing
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
on
the
tart
side
but
fairly
clean
ill
definitely
get
through
the
case
but
might
not
make
it
a
regular
purchase
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
it
is
also
great
in
bottles
where
it
provided
an
even
stronger
aroma
on
draft
seasonally
at
maxs
i
found
it
at
astor
liquor
in
laurel
in
11
2
oz
bottles
d
i
couldnt
sit
and
pound
these
but
its
a
special
treat
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
hazy
ruddy
orange
color
with
a
head
that
goes
on
and
on
high
carbonation
level
musty
and
earthy
aroma
wet
straw
like
you
can
smell
the
farmhouse
in
there
somewhat
sweet

and
musty
dry
sharp
finish
to
it
good
mouthfeelthe
high
level

makes
it
quite
lively
on
the
palate
an
all
around
great
beer
i
think
this
might
be
the
first
saison
i
ever
had
years
ago
still
a

375
ml
corked
bottle
from
bevmo
pours
a
rich
unfiltered
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
fades
very
slowly
aroma
is
strong
with
notes
of
yeast
sour
grapes
breads
and
grass
flavor
is
understated
compared
to
the
aroma
there
is
a
complex
mellowness
to
this
concoction
that
is
mostly
sweet
with
notes
of
wheat
almonds
biscuit
and
pears
hops
were
well
embedded
and
showed
only
toward
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
full
smooth
and
silky
finish
was
long
hoppy
dry
and
semisweet
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
at
any
occasion
i
think
it
might
go
particularly
well
with
seafood
highly
recommended
d
refreshing
and
versitile
can
drink
with
or
without
food
for
one
or
more
drinks
i
love
this
beer
could
drink
on
any
given
day
preferably
a
sunny
afternoon
would
like
to
go
for
a
robust
chicken
salad
good
reputation
and
understandably
so
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
i
was
sure
not
to
get
any
of
the
yeast
on
the
initial
pour
the
aroma
was
slightly
citrusy
but
with
a
sour
note
that
almost
smelled
like
the
beer
was
bad
the
flavor
was
not
what
i
expected
only
a
bit
of
citrus
poked
through
the
musty
dry
flavor
there
was
an
abundance
of
bitterness
i
actually
had
a
hard
time
finishing
the
entire
750
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
but
not
a
beer
ill
drink
again
unless
i
go
to
back
to
belgium
d
a
great
allaround
beer
could
do
lots
of
things
with
it
from
relaxing
poolside
or
pairing
it
with
a
5course
meal
very
versatile
beer
a
tad
pricey
but
worth
it
every
time
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
clean
and
refreshing
my
first
time
trying
this
but
it
wont
be
the
last
would
even
make
a
great
session
beer
if
not
for
the
price
but
its
also
a
perfect
beer
to
break
out
a
bottle
or
two
for
those
special
occasions
comment
i
enjoy
saisons
as
a
change
of
pace
from
other
belgiums
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
belongs
in
the
lineup
for
summer
parties
and
picnics
awesome
beer
edit
i
was
going
to
change
my
review
because
3
85
seems
awfully
low
for
a
beer
this
enjoyable
however
i
noticed
that
other
reviewers
noticed
the
skunkiness
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
shippers
and
distributors
arent
helping
but
neither
is
the
green
bottle
i
let
my
scoring
stand
but
if
you
can
let
the
skunkiness
flash
off
then
this
is
a
great
beer
well
worth
drinking

my
favorite
beer
all
around
notes
what
a
strange
brew
this
is
its
my
first
of
the
saison
style
and
probably
wont
be
my
last
my
only
complaint
and
the
thing
that
will
probably
keep
me
from
buying
this
for
wuite
sometime
is
the
hefty
price
that
comes
on
a
glass
of
this
it
was
about
6
dollars
ouch
wow
this
is
delicious
notes
of
wheat
fruit
and
honey
complement
organic
grasses
vanilla
coriander
spice
and
not
too
sweet
malts
some
alcohol
peeks
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
crisp
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
but
bubbly
and
refreshing
a
bitter
bite
on
the
end
lets
you
know
some
spicy
hops
are
at
work
id
probably
have
this
beer
every
day
if
my
liver
and
budget
would
allow
it
definitely
a
worthwhile
saison
pours
with
a
towering
white
head
which
takes
quite
some
time
to
settle
over
the
super
yeast
sedimented
pale
orangeygolden
liquid
nose
is
loaded
with
horse
blanket
aromas
and
fruitiness
mingling
with
a
light
maltiness
and
yeastiness
the
taste
is
wonderfully
light
bodied
and
hoppy
with
lots
of
fruity
overtones
coupled
with
an
effervescent
carbonation
makes
this
a
very
refreshing
and
tasty
and
winningcombination
thge
finish
is
damm
near
perfect
with
the
fruitysweet
flavors
morphing
into
a
gorgeously
hoppy
dry
long
finish
this
is
one
outstanding
saison
if
you
see
it
try
it
this
is
a
tale
of
two
beers
i
sampled
it
after
letting
it
sit
out
for
a
little
while
i
started
pretty
cold
and
it
seemed
pretty
pedestrian
about
a
610
as
it
warms
it
smooths
out
and
becomes
more
complex
wow
will
fight
with
hennepin
for
space
in
my
shopping
carriage
very
good
saison
i
was
apprehensive
at
first
the
cork
popped
and
all
i
could
smell
was
skunk
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
taste
was
quite
the
opposite
the
pour
was
light
golden
with
a
huge
billowing
head
and
great
sustained
lacing
extremely
light
body
great
carbonation
and
smooth
going
down
very
subtle
belgian
spiciness
grassy
earthy
and
very
fresh
there
is
a
slight
yeasty
sourness
which
helps
round
out
the
finish
definately
needs
to
be
paired
with
some
quality
food
it
can
only
make
it
better
this
one
transported
me
elsewhere
and
what
else
can
you
ask
of
a
good
beer
than
that
it
came
corked
in
dark
green
glass
watch
your
eyes
as
the
cork
pushed
its
way
out
as
soon
as
i
removed
the
wire
cap
a
huge
creamy
white
head
the
smell
is
thich
with
malt
yeast
and
spice
classic
belgium
beer
the
taste
is
nice
with
notes
of
yeast
and
spice
with
a
slight
hint
of
alchol
very
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
by
the
grill
pleasant
but
really
quite
short
of
spectacular
you
have
to
wait
a
bit
for
the
head
to
settle
but
it
remains
huge
as
i
take
my
first
sip
first
sip
blows
me
away
as
it
has
greater
depth
than
ive
ever
experienced
in
another
saison
there
are
many
layers
of
flavors
that
dramatically
change
with
such
quickness
it
is
difficult
to
discern
each
and
pick
apart
everything
judiciously
it
begins
like
a
typical
saison
with
a
lemon
zest
taste
and
then
moves
to
a
peppery
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
dry
but
the
aftertaste
develops
a
life
of
its
own
with
full
flavored
bitterness
unlike
any
other
ample
carbonation
in
this
one
does
not
detract
from
its
flavor
but
seems
to
warm
the
palate
highly
complex
and
drinkable
brew
everything
you
want
in
a
saison
taken
to
a
new
level
drinkability
is
very
good
an
awesome
summer
beer
and
a
benchmark
representative
of
the
farmhouse
style
much
like
duvel
and
belgian
golden
ales
one
that
i
always
like
having
around
a
wonderful
ale
for
florida
weather
a
hoppy
but
not
so
bitter
belgian
the
nose
is
funky
hops
gotta
love
it
and
the
malt
doesnt
do
much
it
mostly
provides
a
nice
sweet
backbone
the
grassy
hops
and
farmhouse
aromas
dominate
and
carry
through
into
the
aftertaste
all
the
while
the
carbonation
provides
a
duvellike
feel
with
a
similar
fluffy
white
head
overall
highly
drinkable
the
perfect
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
very
complex
and
tasty
when
i
think
of
this
style
this
is
the
beer
that
comes
to
mind
which
is
were
im
headed
right

i
heard
one
reviewer
describe
this

the
main
aroma
in

is
of

the
light

the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
fresh
hops
and
spring
fields
the
flavor
contains
just
the
right
amount
of
citrus
hops
that
fades
into
a
clean
and

aftertaste
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
moderate
and
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation

a
light

could
sell
my
soul
for
this
brew
okay
and
lightly
sweet
but
lacks
the
citrus
rind
and
spice
of
fresh
versions
the
body
is
thin
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
creamy
a
contrast
from
the
biting
carbonation
of
a
fresh
bottle
in
this
case
i
enjoyed
the
aged
version
just
as
much
as
a
fresh
one
its
notably
different
crisp
peppery
finish

this

away
from

at
all
normally
i
would
see
this
as

really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
second
time
around
foret
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
light
orange
tint
under
a
3
thick
mousey
head
that
looks
like
freshly
fallen
snow
and
very
slowly
collapses
leaving
art
nouveau
designs
on
the
glass
it
has
a
big
saison
nose
with
light
fruit

earthiness
bread
and
a
light
funk
bready
malt
leads
the
palate
seasoned
with
light
fruit
malty

citrus
and
a
slight
funk
that
becomes
tart
on

the
beer
has
an

makes
the
beer
with

i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brew
its
a
fine
example
of
the
beer
but
nothing
uber
special
overall
this
is
a
balanced
and
very
drinkable
saison
delicious
overall
this
is
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
the
honey
like
sweetness
meshes
perfectly
with
the
grassy
earthy
notes
crisp
without
being
over
the
top
simply
a
masterfully
crafted
brew
evokes
springtime
with
flowering
plants
and
pollen
circulating
the
primary
aroma
here
is
honey
and
spicy
phenolics
which
remind
me
of
clove
ginger
pepper
candied
lemon
drop
and
banana
delightfully
airy
texture
a
fine
mousse
like
the
finest
champagne
but
better
because
it
persists
great
acidity
tropical
fruit
like
pineapple
along
with
citrus
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
there
is
some
skunkiness
that
i
didnt
get
when
i
tried
this
on
tap
but
i
think
it
adds
some
funky
character
that
doesnt
detract
from
the
balance
this
is
the
definitive
saison
complex
yet
refreshing
and
might
surpass
regular
dupont
o
oh
yeah
this
is
the
shit
the
skunky
nose
isnt
so
offputting
as
to
ruin
this
and
every
other
aspect
is
at
least
excellent
its
so
drinkable
yet
so
rich
and
so
flavorful
i
need
more
of
this
in
my
life
awesome
stuff
an
organic
version
of
the
famous
dupont
saison
hazy
goldenrod
colored
beer
with
a
brassy
glimmer
and
an
inch
and
a
half
of
frothing
white
head
i
smell
the
sugar
in
this
immediately
candy
sugar
in
its
rawest
form
not
all
the
way
fermented
out
but
not
too
sweet
either
a
lot
like
a
tripel
on
the
nose
but
the
yeast
is
far
more
interesting
classic
belgian
saison
strain
gives
the
farmhouse
profile
without
ever
getting
into
the
funky
or
weird
zone
i
highly
appreciate
the
malt
depth
on
this
its
sturdy
wheat
with
some
body
and
again
with
a
touch
of
residual
sugar
a
well
refined
yet
very
rustic
ale
id
love
to
culture
some
of
this
yeast
for
a
brew
of
my
own
great
effervescence
in
the
feel
even
though
though
the
body
is
heavier
than
a
lot
of
american
examples
of
the
style
yeast
and
sugar
dual
in
the
finish
this
may
change
over
time
as
we
know
these
two
ingredients
are
not
stable
together
great
beer
especially
for
the
price
props
for
being
organic
even
though
its
supposed
to
be
the
same
this
is
appreciably
different
and
superior
from
the
regular
saison
dupont
this
is
a
great
saison
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
i
am
a
huge
saison
fan
and
this
one
is
very
well
balanced
and
has
nice
aroma
and
flavors
the
one
thing
that
i
do
have
to
take
down
points
for
is
that
this
is
way
to
carbonated
for
my
taste
i
like
to
be
able
to
move
the
beer
around
in
my
mouth
so
that
i
can
taste
it
everywhere
cant
do
it
with
this
beer
the
carbonation
is
too
high
its
to
style
still
so
im
not
knocking
it
down
that
much
but
thats
the
only
real
flaw
that
i
see
overall
a
great
organic
offering
that
represents
the
best
of
the
style
a
great
beer
from
one
of
the
worlds
best
breweries
nice
appearance
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
lacing
lots
of
funk
in
the
nose
true
to
the
style
from
beginning
to
end
i
cant
think
of
a
better
organic
beer
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
real
soon
so
many
beers
so
little
time
o
dupont
masters
the
saison
and
this
further
proves
it
that
dry
spicy
peppery
flavor
that
defines
a
saison
is
all
here
their
original
is
better
but
this
is
a
nice
change
up
overall
if
only
this
beer
wasnt
packaged
in
a
green
bottle
it
would
be
so
much
better
still
a
very
good
beer
but
it
really
is
hindered
by
the
skunk
reviewed
43007
pleasant
enough
but
very
subtle
hoping
for
more
of
that
fresh
saison
character
this
was
just
ok
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
spice
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
yeast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
solid
farmhousestyle
ale
wellcrafted
and
balanced
a
bit
too
spicy
and
dry
for
my
personal
taste
but
i
enjoyed
it
nontheless
t
interesting
very
complex
layer
and
after
layer
in
this
beer
i
was
told
this
is
considered
the
best
beer
in
the
world
now
ive
been
tasting
beer
for
years
but
maybe
im
still
not
ready
for
it
it
has
the
malt
and
bready
yeast
plus
the
banana
from
the
nose
but
it
also
has
the
layers
of
coriander
and
vanilla
plus
hints
of
cinnamon
and
clove
on
the
finish
in
fact
the
finish
lingers
for
quite
a
while
but
its
almost
too
spiced
for
me
i
want
to
say
bitter
but
bitter
isnt
the
word
being
allergic
to
cinnamon
i
personally
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
because
it
made
my
tongue
tingle
the
same
way
the
spice
does
perhaps
one
day
i
can
see
why
people
like
it
it
truly
is
well
made
and
the
layers
are
fun
to
dig
through
its
a
surprise
which
in
a
world
of
boring
beer
is
refreshing
but
for
me
personally
its
a
no
go
reminds
me
of
the
original
a
lot
with
an
extremely
flavorful
yet
clean
saison
yeast
feel
the
classic
strain
love
the
spicy
and
floralgrassy
interplay
othis
brew
is
a
pretty
mixed
bag
it
is
ok
to
look
at
and
the
feel
is
pretty
close
to
style
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
underwhelming
i
keep
getting
skunky
notes
and
while
the
bottle
i
consumed
might
have
been
lightstruck
i
couldnt
help
but
think
that
the
flavor
profile
was
intentional
anyway
if
you
are
a
fan
of
ultragrassy
ultrasharp
slightly
skunky
saisons
this
might
be
worth
your
time
overall
this
is
a
really
gorgeous
beer
smooth
lovely
and
amazingly
drinkable
its
velvety
its
caressing
its
calming
wonderful
stuff
o
a
great
saison
a
balanced
tasty
and
intense
flavor
and
aroma
i
can
see
why
people
want
to
use
this
yeast
for
their
saisons
i
much
prefer
the
dryness
i
get
here
to
the
sweeter
american
versions
a
very
nice
saison
though
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
the
flagship
dupont
it
just
seems
a
bit
simpler
no
big
complaints
and
it
might
just
be
a
case
of
being
so
used
to
saison
dupont
thats
its
hard
to
avoid
comparison
bias
completely
overall
a
nice
very
classy
beer
im
a
sucker
for
anything
thats
farmhouse
i
prefer
a
little
more
funk
and
spice
and
less
hop
forwardness
in
a
belgian
this
seems
to
be
toward
the
champagne
end
of
the
saison
spectrum
just
as
is
their
saison
dupont
foret
is
however
a
bit
more
robust
than
the
dupont
and
for
that
reason
id
get
foret
again
cc
bottle
opened
with
a
nice
pop
the
pour
is
lively
with
more
than
half
a
glass
of
head
which
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
heavy
lacing
the
nose
is
funky
plenty
of
sulfuricskunky
notes
along
with
heavy
cereal
grains
and
a
light
lemony
hops
the
taste
fruity
up
front
with
lemon
sugar
and
grain
this
is
followed
by
a
mellow
tartness
that
provides
a
bit
of
a
bite
behind
the
bite
is
more
evidence
of
the
sulfur
notes
which
leaves
an
off
putting
flavor
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
high
with
carbonation
and
moderate
in
the
body
department
overall
this
saison
has
funk
but
the
funk
is
not
in
the
form
that
i
can
enjoy
this
is
one
that
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
soft
medium
body
with
brisk
but
fading
carbonation
sweet
fruitness
followed
by
soft
honey
and
herbal
flavors
and
a
nice
malty
sweetness
there
is
a
significant
hop
herbal
hop
snap
that
comes
along
on
the
back
end
of
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
yeast
bite
that
cuts
the
sweetness
so
briskly
for
a
smooth
and
refreshing
finish
a
simple
beer
but
with
extraordinary
flavors
that
go
well
together
and
flavors
that
come
from
both
sweet
malts
yeast
and
hops
a
lot
of
stuff
working
very
well
together
super
dry
finish
very
nice
flavors
of
funky
tropical
melon
rind
slight
black
pepper
amber
malts
and
field
flower
flavors
however
you
define
them
when
you
get
into
the
farm
artisan
styles
of
brew
the
relative
quality
of
flavors
and
enjoyment
varies
we
each
have
our
own
expectations
desires
and
tolerance
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
and
fresh
from
the
brewery
is
lovely
but
shipped
here
to
colorado
it
also
is
wonderful
very
different
from
the
regular
saison
dupont
and
more
complex
a
challenging
but
lovely
farmhouse
type
brew
it
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
the
off
white
head
is
very
thick
with
excellent
retention
and
it
leaves
gorgeous
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
yeasty
and
musty
green
apple
and
delicate
hints
of
some
tropical
fruit
as
well
the
taste
is
lighter
than
expected
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
yeast
is
detectable
but
it
is
toned
down
its
sweet
up
front
with
hints
of
candied
fruits
that
eventually
becomes
slightly
tart
fresh
juicy
apple
with
a
slightly
dissapointing
yeast
undertone
appear
midpalate
the
finish
has
an
ever
so
slight
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
it
has
a
lighter
mouthfeel
and
the
carbanation
is
pleasantly
gentle
if
you
havent
tried
this
already
pick
up
a
bottle
pours
hazy
golden
with
huge
off
white
head
that
dissipates
and
leave
some
lacing
down
the
glass
lots
of
yeast
smell
in
this
one
maybe
a
little
funk
taste
is
light
with
decent
hops
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
due
the
the
abundant
carbonation
overall
ive
had
better
but
this
isnt
the
worst
o
well
while
this
is
one
of
the
better
organic
brews
ive
had
the
green
bottle
always
on
the
top
shelf
directly
underneath
the
overhead
bright
lights
has
to
effect
something
while
the
quality
of
the
malts
come
into
question
otherwise
this
compares
favorably
to
the
saison
dupont
this
is
worth
picking
up
especially
if
youre
the
type
who
wants
to
support
organic
products
o
pretty
good
i
think
im
getting
more
into
saisons
o
very
good
but
not
the
best
ive
had
from
dupont
i
feel
like
the
alcohol
is
too
noticeable
slightly
cloudy
orangeyellow
pour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
retained
well
and
coated
the
glass
with
lacing
flowers
and
lots
of
wet
funk
in
the
nose
pale
malts
belgian
yeast
the
taste
wasnt
nearly
as
funky
as
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
it
would
be
floral
grassy
light
toasted
bread
sweet
with
honey
and
pale
malts
notes
of
citrus
and
light
spice
while
the
nose
was
a
bit
heavy
on
the
funk
this
beer
was
pretty
smooth
lightmedium
in
body
and
quite
drinkable
overall
i
havent
been
impressed
by
many
if
any
dupont
beers
but
this
one
was
not
bad
overall
quite
nice
another
good
beer
from
this
brewery
not
too
shabby
but
i
dont
need
my
saison
dupont
to
be
certified
organic
i
still
prefer
the
original
to
this
take
o
taste
and
aroma
seem
subdued
i
expected
a
little
better
from
dupont
o
a
great
beer
but
i
do
prefer
the
standard
saison
by
dupont
this
has
a
more
interesting
aroma
from
a
distance
but
very
similar
to
its
more
common
brother
the
standard
saison
i
would
still
recommend
trying
this
or
making
it
your
go
to
replacement
for
the
standard
saison
when
not
available
expected
this
to
be
a
wit
not
a
saison
overall
this
is
quite
possibly
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
saison
i
would
not
hesitate
to
build
a
meal
paired
specifically
for
enjoying
this
saison
to
its
fullest
spot
on
saison

tremendously

insane
balance

extremely
crisp

to
sip
on
i
am
going
to
have
to
revisit
the
normal
saision
dupont
soon
to
compare
this
is
apparently
the
organically
brewed
version
of
that
wow
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
straw
yellow
with
a
little
gold
touching
its
edges
the
head
pours
big
smooth
and
frothy
and
it
lasts
leaving
short
sticky
walls
of
fat
lacing
on
the
sides
the
beer
smells
big
and
funky
practically
skunked
but
very
strongly
of
hay
and
barnyard
funk
lemon
bread
sits
nicely
below
the
funk
giving
it
an
almost
biscuity
scent
the
esters
seem
citrusy
as
well
but
overall
this
smell
is
all
about
the
barnyard
funk
on
the
taste
the
beer
is
wonderfully
simple
in
its
complexity
if
that
makes
sense
the
beer
starts
with
a
nice
light
fruit
flavor
that
moves
into
the
wonderful
barnyard
funk
mixed
with
some
light
biscuit
before
opening
up
into
some
lovely
hay
and
citrus
fruits
with
lemon
orange
peel
and
slight
pineapple
playing
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
light
pepper
mouthfeel
is
fiercely
prickly
and
effervescent
but
that
works
with
this
beer
and
helps
to
prepare
the
tongue
for
the
thick
lasting
ooze
on
the
tip
while
the
back
of
the
throat
dries
out
and
begs
for
more
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
tothetee
saison
it
has
all
the
hall
marks
of
the
style
from
the
citrus
to
the
pepper
to
the
distinguished
barnyard
funk
this
is
worth
a
try
for
any
saison
lover
out
there
and
for
any
beer
lovers
looking
for
a
classic
example
of
the
saison
served
from
tap
into
a
vieille
provisions
saison
dupont
willi
glass
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
spices
floral
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
floral
grain
banana
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
good
brew
this
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
lots
of
the
right
flavors
in
all
the
right
places
it
did
have
a
nice
balance
going
on
as
well
with
the
floral
and
banana
aspect
going
on
i
really
wish
this
would
have
carried
over
into
the
aroma
some
as
it
was
a
little
light
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
as
it
was
pretty
nice
but
i
wouldnt
make
it
my
first
drink
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
but
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
overall
a
great
organic
offering
that
i
like
slightly
more
than
the
traditional
saison
dupont
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
a
bit
too
watery
and
not
very
interesting
the
smell
was
better
than
the
taste
bottle
overall
4
0
as
with
the
taste
rating
nothing
about
this
beer
really
blows
me
away
but
everything
is
done
well
and
very
well
at
that
classic
saison
true
to
style
of
the
nonbretty
varieties
and
just
very
evenhanded
and
welldone
great
job
cant
wait
to
try
other
duponts
in
the
future
incredible
aroma
and
flavor
complex
and
hard
to
believe
no
spices
just
cant
place
the
aroma
maybe
some
kind
of
bread
cooking
a
bit
heavy
for
a
traditional
saison
mouthful
a
bit
heavy
and
creamy
and
id
guess
wheat
but
ingredients
dont
list
it
not
a
favorite
saison
of
mine
but
well
made
and
worth
trying
o
this
was
great
very
enjoyable
when
i
hear
farmhouse
ale
i
imagine
a
warm
summer
day
blues
skies
and
a
red
barn
withd
stacks
of
hay
this
is
exactly
what
you
want
to
be
drinking
had
this
on
tap
at
the
front
door
a
nice
1
frothy
white
head
on
a
straw
colored
clear
beer
with
plenty
of
carbination
a
nice
floral
boquet
with
a
hint
of
citrus
i
like
belgian
beer
and
saisons
so
this
beer
appealed
to
me
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
overall
very
enjoyable
would
be
a
great
summer
saison
wish
the
abv
was
a
bit
lower
will
buy
again
375
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
dupont
glass
this
beer
is
in
a
green
bottle
and
it
was
on
a
shelf
near
a
big
window
i
tried
to
get
the
one
that
was
the
most
shaded
but
to
no
avail
this
has
a
pretty
skunky
aroma
its
my
fault
for
buying
it
though
so
ill
evaluate
after
it
breathes
awhile
in
the
meantime
the
color
is
a
slightly
orangetinted
gold
totally
opaque
with
a
towering
french
vanilla
head
five
minutes
later
revisiting
the
aroma
the
skunk
has
left
the
building
now
its
mainly
grass
pepper
pale
malts
and
honey
pretty
classic
nonbrett
saison
aroma
that
malty
honeyed
aspect
combined
with
a
mild
banana
pith
note
to
form
the
bedrock
of
the
flavor
its
honestly
a
little
sweet
for
me
and
lacks
refreshing
character
of
the
gardenvariety
saison
dupont
this
shortcoming
is
reduced
a
bit
when
i
pour
the
last
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
and
get
some
yeast
mixing
in
finish
is
dry
with
a
touch
of
mineral
character
but
theres
some
residual
sweetness
that
sticks
around
the
back
if
the
palate
great
brew
why
some
low
ratings
this
is
a
terrific
saison
taste
is
back
to
what
i
expected
lots
and
lots
of
lemon
rind
i
would
guess
an
overdose
of
belgian
yeast
this
is
a
rather
dry
beer
with
good
carbonation
i
mean
lots
of
carbonated
bite
many
other
saison
beers
i
have
had
lately
are
thicker
body
and
sweeter
this
one
is
a
nice
change
the
overwhelming
taste
here
is
the
citrus
rind
but
funk
is
also
evident
i
find
this
beer
pretty
refreshing
overall
45
easy
to
drink
belgian
saison
a
little
scary
because
it
is
7
5
so
it
could
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
might
seek
out
other
saisons
as
i
can
imagine
a
better
version
would
i
consider
buying
again
no
certainly
not
the
best
saison
that
ive
had
but
very
tasty
and
very
refreshing
if
it
were
on
tap
at
my
local
joint
i
would
def
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
personally
prefer
the
sour
end
of
the
belgium
spectrum
but
this
was
still
a
nice
buy
a
product
of
dupont
house
that
is
to
say
a
great
product
this
saison
is
tangyspicy
with
mildly
hoppy
noble
flavor
with
slight
melon
and
white
grape
from
the
yeast
and
mild
tealike
flavor
with
the
wheat
taste
coming
forward
midtaste
which
gives
a
slight
citrus
tang
and
hint
of
grassy
character
comes
in
toward
the
finish
with
slight
dustiness
from
the
yeast
and
an
almost
crackerlike
malt
toastiness
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
a
very
good
saison
with
plenty
of
that
trademark
dupont
character
which
is
very
fresh
and
has
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
with
plenty
of
drinkability
to
spare
it
refreshes
and
the
dry
body
is
something
i
am
fond
of
pretty
great
for
the
style
besides
the
skunkiness
it
was
an
enjoyable
but
overall
forgettable
saison
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
one
and
see
how
it
compares
love
a
little
bit
more
spice
and
lemon
in
my
saisons
while
i
dont
see
the
big
connection
here
between
this
and
normal
dupont
this
is
a
nice
funkyfruity
saison
id
recommend
from
the
dupont
family
lighter
than
both
the
saison
dupont
and
bon
voeux
an
awesome
starter
saison
for
anyone
wanting
to
get
started
on
farmhouse
style
ales
o
this
is
an
excellent
saison
and
would
be
a
masterpiece
from
any
brewery
that
did
not
produce
saison
dupont
compared
to
the
classic
it
is
a
little
thinner
and
a
little
less
intense
but
remains
an
extremely
solid
enjoyable
brew
the
flavor
of
this
isnt
like
any
saison
ive
had
i
dont
dislike
it
or
like
it
it
really
is
unique
and
worth
trying
if
for
nothing
else
to
try
a
unique
flavor
i
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
the
flavors
dont
work
for
me
it
seems
like
theres
an
amount
of
stale
dead
flavor
i
will
drink
this
many
times
in
the
future
im
sure
this
has
a
bold
effervescence
that
just
dances
on
the
palate
have
i
used
that
phrase
before
its
just
as
appropriate
here
more
suited
for
spring
than
the
cooling
days
of
fall
as
the
palate
reminds
me
of
well
lets
see
some
zest
more
lemon
than
orange
flowers
ever
so
slightly
a
bit
of
damp
hay
like
the
first
warming
rains
of
the
season
perhaps
as
this
is
the
organic
version
of
the
styles
classic
i
certainly
expected
just
as
much
every
bit
an
enjoyable
saison
o
not
the
best
of
the
style
by
any
means
but
worth
a
try
o
an
ok
saison
easily
poundable
too
malty
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
smooth
fun
thirst
quenching
beer
thats
perfect
for
sunny
afternoon
taste
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
malty
but
not
sweet
apple
and
other
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
through
the
middle
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
dry
finish
that
has
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
everything
out
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
for
quite
some
time
scent
is
extremely
grassy
and
reeks
of
tart
green
apples
melon
and
citrus
there
are
some
lovely
belgian
yeast
notes
as
well
not
much
funk
to
this
one
taste
is
initially
melon
flavors
then
shifts
to
green
apples
lemon
and
mango
then
i
get
some
grassy
flavors
with
belgian
yeast
and
clove
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
dry
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
saison
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
saison
but
a
saison
worth
trying
overall
worth
the
try
in
a
330
ml
bottle
there
are
better
saisons
to
be
had
d
very
nice
saison
offering
that
ill
be
keeping
my
eye
out
for
again
bonus
marks
for
a
killer
label
750
ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
2010
printed
on
the
cork
served
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
long
time
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
lemon
peel
pears
herbs
tart
apples
and
a
bit
of
skunk
and
funk
the
brew
tastes
like
lemon
peel
peppery
spice
bready
malt
and
some
apple
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
well
carbonated
and
a
bit
dry
its
a
little
too
well
carbonated
for
my
liking
not
a
bad
brew
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
much
of
anything
for
me
ill
have
to
try
this
again
in
the
future
but
for
now
id
pick
other
saisons
before
this
one
overall
fantastic
this
beer
was
poured
for
me
as
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
hazy
and
not
see
through
at
all
the
smell
is
a
little
funy
but
its
mostly
grainy
and
has
a
light
amount
of
hops
the
taste
is
also
grainy
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
belgian
yeast
on
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
leaving
just
a
light
bubbly
bite
on
the
tongue
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
farmhouse
ale
oh
and
it
is
organic
no
pesticides
and
chemicals
in
the
water
that
my
homebrew
comes
from
overall
normally
im
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
but
something
about
this
one
felt
slightly
lacking
to
me
the
look
drew
me
in
but
i
dont
think
the
flavor
lived
up
to
its
appeal
i
would
almost
certainly
have
this
one
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
was
very
well
retained
throughout
the
beer
that
also
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
had
the
aroma
that
you
would
expect
from
the
style
a
nice
spicy
citrus
aroma
with
hints
of
the
yeast
the
taste
is
excellent
what
one
would
expect
from
a
saison
but
this
one
takes
it
up
a
notch
a
nice
strong
spicy
and
citrus
taste
with
that
belgian
yeast
backbone
the
beer
had
a
lighter
medium
feel
to
it
with
higher
carbonation
but
as
expected
the
beer
had
a
nice
dry
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
am
glad
that
i
ran
across
and
i
hope
to
again
o
not
overly
impressed
but
overall
solid
great
mouthfeel
that
is
well
carbonated
and
carries
great
front
to
back
refreshing
crisp
body
with
a
full
mouth
feel
you
should
pick
up
a
bottle
yup
i
stand
by
that
universal
statement
notes
while
not
extraordinary
this
sits
better
on
my
palate
than
their
classic
dupont
not
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
organic
certification
hype
aside
id
gladly
cross
paths
with
this
one
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
medium
body
feel
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
foret
is
not
a
bad
saison
the
funk
however
does
seem
to
overpower
the
malts
and
the
beer
lacks
the
amazing
diversity
of
flavors
you
get
from
saison
dupont
earthier
sweeter
pull
than
the
infamous
saison
dupont
plenty
of
alcohol
and
hop
drying
going
on
in
the
finish
sharper
flavor
contrasts
than
i
typically
like
in
a
saison
not
exactly
refreshing
seems
to
lack
the
brightness
and
snappy
clean
deliciousness
of
a
dupont
although
if
it
is
farmhouse
flavors
you
are
seeking
this
is
your
beer
yeast
plays
a
huge
role
in
this
beer
and
throws
off
lots
of
funky
esters
alot
of
character
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
make
it
through
in
americanbrewed
saisons
that
said
i
still
find
this
a
little
disappointing
considering
brasserie
dupont
kicks
out
the
quintessential
example
of
the
style
in
the
lovely
green
and
yellow
checkered
label
d
a
very
refreshing
brew
great
variety
of
tastes
there
is
hardly
a
better
balanced
more
versatile
saison
on
the
shelves
than
foret
d
as
i
mentioned
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
this
style
the
thing
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
slightly
funky
malty
character
and
bitter
flavors
the
typical
banana
and
clove
notes
you
find
in
belgians
take
a
back
seat
to
the
earthy
malt
flavor
hop
bitterness
and
peppery
spice
a
very
unique
beer
o
of
the
dupont
saisons
this
is
probably
my
favorite
nicely
complex
with
lots
of
good
flavors
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
hold
a
flame
to
saison
dupont
rustic
earthy
and
a
bit
raw
and
an
overall
enjoyable
saison
overall
not
too
bad
masking
a
high
abv
but
really
small
in
taste
and
flavor
feels
alright
but
nothing
much
that
seems
to
grab
me
while
drinking
this
beer
overall
great
saison
doesnt
compare
to
fantome
but
nothing
does
very
enjoyable
and
complex
drinks
incredibly
easily
i
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
overall
this
saison
is
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
definitely
would
seek
this
one
out
again
down
the
road
overall
a
damn
fine
saison
tasty
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
possibly
duponts
finest
saison
d
an
excellent
saison
has
a
nice
earth
profile
with
good
fruits
coming
from
the
same
place
that
does
saison
dupont
i
almost
like
and
enjoy
this
one
better
tm
very
effervescent
there
is
a
definite
malt
presence
there
are
some
lemon
or
citrus
character
and
some
spicy
notes
as
well
there
is
a
slight
bitter
edge
but
its
not
a
bad
thing
i
think
it
helps
even
out
the
beer
i
congratulate
brasserie
dupont
for
such
a
unique
brew
but
i
struggled
getting
through
the
one
glass
i
was
happy
to
be
sharing
the
bottle
and
dont
really
ever
want
to
drink
this
again
notes
this
is
an
outstanding
saison
with
classic
belgian
flavor
and
complexity
all
in
a
deceivingly
drinkable
package
overall
saison
dupont
is
awesome
and
this
one
was
well
not
so
much
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
dry
crisp
or
refreshing
saison
is
my
favorite
style
this
one
was
not
for
me
at
all
d
surprisingly
roasty
and
smoky
for
a
saison
my
mouth
tastes
and
feels
like
i
just
smoked
a
cuban
and
downed
a
pint
of
bourbon
its
certainly
interesting
overall
an
excellent
beer
very
unique
and
enjoyable
di
prefer
this
to
the
regular
dupont
a
really
great
saison
that
i
will
revisit
in
the
future
d
this
beer
is
refreshing
satisfying
and
provides
a
nice
feeling
that
beer
can
be
both
complex
and
simple
i
feel
like
i
should
do
out
and
buy
the
rest
of
this
where
i
found
it
so
good
pours
a
very
hazy
blonde
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
leaving
plenty
of
lace
the
aroma
is
funky
with
some
barnyard
notes
but
has
a
lot
of
fresh
noble
and
maybe
czech
hop
character
in
there
as
well
there
is
a
pronounced
fruitiness
with
some
lemon
and
banana
as
well
the
flavor
is
nicely
spicy
with
a
good
fruitiness
and
banana
with
a
nice
spicy
hoppiness
there
is
a
mild
tartness
and
a
great
earthy
and
minerally
character
as
well
once
again
the
palate
is
sprizty
and
full
like
a
good
saision
should
be
among
my
favorites
in
the
style
d
a
refreshing
offering
with
a
bit
of
complexity
also
there
is
a
unicorn
on
the
label
d
sweet
and
flavorful
the
balance
across
everything
is
incredible
especially
for
the
style
not
better
or
worse
that
saison
dupont
but
enjoyably
different
d
no
doubt
this
beer
could
be
enjoyed
in
a
good
quantity
over
an
evening
very
drinkable
despite
the
sweetness
it
ends
dry
so
it
is
not
nauseating
a
saison
should
finish
dry
and
this
one
does
flavor
coats
the
palate
for
quite
a
while
despite
the
dry
finish
despite
the
lighter
flavor
of
this
style
the
7
5
abv
is
very
well
hidden
very
drinkable
highly
flavorful
saison
from
dupont
d
great
drinkability
but
a
tad
sweet
taste
is
a
delicious
balance
between
the
fruity
yeasts
a
bit
of
nutmegclove
like
spicey
flavour
and
a
clean
refreshing
hop
backbone
just
a
joy
to
drink
d
foret
is
so
sweet
and
intense
i
dont
think
i
could
have
enjoyed
much
more
than
the
5
or
6
ounces
i
tried
however
i
appreciate
the
attempt
at
being
different
this
is
an
utterly
original
saison
d
i
like
this
beer
but
am
unlikely
to
reach
for
it
over
saison
dupont
or
a
better
bspa
to
start
this
will
go
good
with
a
brunch
high
in
fat
the
savory
and
spicy
flavors
in
the
beer
will
go
well
with
most
savory
breakfasts
and
the
meat
even
hollandaise
sauce
cant
stand
up
to
the
high
levels
of
carbonation
here
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
billowing
white
head
great
retention
and
think
rings
of
lace
when
it
finally
begins
to
settle
smell
spicy
lemony
grainy
with
a
little
banana
taste
very
similar
to
the
nose
very
mildly
sweet
and
grainy
pils
malt
fairly
aggressive
spicy
hopping
lemon
muted
grassy
and
banana
notes
finishes
a
bit
peppery
carbonation
is
maybe
a
little
high
this
seems
quite
different
from
their
flagship
saison
and
not
in
a
good
way
but
its
still
pretty
enjoyable
not
sure
how
to
read
the
code
on
the
label
but
according
to
the
cork
a
2010
bottling
750
ml
green
champagne
bottle
with
cork
and
cage
presentation
conditioned
with
2
008
on
the
cork
brewed
with
organic
malt
and
hops
and
filtered
artesian
well
water
it
is
a
lightlyhazed
golden
straw
with
an
inch
of
whitish
head
that
is
constantly
replenished
by
the
high
carbonation
and
leaves
loads
of
frothy
lacing
and
i
drink
quite
aromatic
perfumy
and
fruity
with
orange
pear
peach
light
hops
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
similar
flavor
with
the
addition
of
spicy
hops
and
yeast
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
perhaps
a
little
earthy
with
a
flash
of
cork
and
a
light
dose
of
sourness
on
top
of
a
medium
body
that
delivers
lots
of
mouthfilling
foam
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
the
higher
alcohol
content
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
great
saison
however
i
prefer
the
saison
dupont
slightly
over
this
brew
this
has
less
banana
and
tropical
yeast
flavors
and
more
spicy
notes
still
a
very
nice
belgian
d
this
beer
was
a
great
surprise
i
tend
to
love
saisons
and
feel
that
belgians
do
it
so
much
better
this
was
a
good
example
d
interesting
to
say
the
least
but
saison
du
pont
does
with
class
this
does
with
strength
and
guile
a
little
fruity
for
my
taste
but
it
balances
well
and
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
as
it
quenches
your
thirst
d
this
guy
is
pretty
drinkable
just
curious
as
to
how
long
this
actual
bottle
i
consumed
has
aged
for
i
read
a
few
reviews
about
the
alcohol
being
more
prominent
but
i
didnt
find
it
bothersome
perhaps
my
aging
and
desensitized
palate
is
to
blame
jd
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
saison
a
must
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
a
cloudy
lemonyellow
super
carbonated
with
an
enormous
pillowy
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
lots
of
citrus
in
the
nose
lemon
orange
peel
and
maybe
even
some
peach
belgian
style
yeast
also
in
there
so
far
this
is
excellent
flavor
is
a
vibrant
tangy
moutfull
very
rich
for
a
saison
style
beer
finish
is
long
and
carries
just
a
slight
bitterness
very
excellent
beer
delicious
and
organic
believe
it
or
not
very
much
worth
tracking
down
and
excellent
college
football
beer
d
carbonated
dry
and
hoppy
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
the

drinkability
good
stuff
easy
drinking
this
is
one
i
will
enjoy
again
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
saison
not
my
favorite
but
worthy
decent
flavor
somewhat
disapointing
as
i
expected
something
fantastic
and
i
just
find
it
to
be
okay
yeasty
heavily
carbonated
very
little
alcohol
flavor
for
a
7
5
beer
slight
lemon
taste
very
light
flavor
and
mild
aftertaste
very
drinkable
for
the
alcohol
content
but
not
that
tasty
seems
a
bit
subdued
in
subtleties
vs
the
standard
saison
dupont
but
is
a
worthy
alternative
and
shares
much
of
the
yeast
character
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
alcohol
all
around
an
extremely
solid
beer
i
was
under
the
impression
this
was
simply
an
organic
version
of
duponts
standard
saison
so
the
differences
really
stood
out
hops
arent
as
present
as
i
expected
and
the
phenols
seem
to
be
more
restrained
that
said
all
of
brasserie
duponts
products
seem
to
have
a
little
bottle
variation
so
i
cant
say
for
certain
to
what
extent
the
differences
were
caused
by
the
organic
hops
and
malt
highly
recommended
for
anyone
whos
interested
in
a
bolder
fruitier
saison
it
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
little
residual
sweetness
very
refreshing
and
delicious
very
smooth
on
the
way
down
and
ill
probably
drink
this
one
faster
than
planned
enjoyable
saison
period
dthis
is
very
tasty
lots
of
good
things
going
on
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
have
the
bold
tastes
as
the
aroma
did
but
still
great
balance
of
flavors
nice
carbonation
and
mediumchewy
mouthfeel
not
exactly
something
youd
bang
back
but
goes
down
nicely
this
exemplary
farmhouse
ale
is
supremely
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
moved
from
glass
to
glass
like
it
was
water
bravo
overall
this
is
a
smooth
good
beer
that
falls
short
of
its
counterpart
vieille
provision
it
lacks
the
zest
and
lively
character
of
this
other
brew
and
the
bitterness
is
more
mild
i
miss
it
this
is
still
a
good
beer
in
its
own
right
d
could
definitely
drink
a
bunch
of
this
id
rather
drink
the
traditional
saison
dupont
though
i
miss
the
slight
sour
slight
funk
perhaps
if
this
was
aged
a
while
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
saison
that
showcases
one
aspect
of
the
saison
profile
earthiness
as
opposed
to
fruitiness
sourness
funkiness
hoppiness
or
phenolicness
usually
i
prefer
a
saison
to
try
and
deftly
hit
as
many
of
those
possibilities
as
it
can
but
this
very
earthy
saison
is
really
enjoyable
i
think
i
love
the
narrative
most
of
all
it
uses
usda
certified
organic
hops
and
barley
and
filtered
artisan
well
water
but
the
flavors
also
invoke
nature
and
the
circle
of
life
new
growth
is
generated
from
the
decay
of
the
old
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
there
is
no
nebulous
scoring
category
of
artisticness
that
i
can
rank
this
beer
in
but
it
would
score
highly
in
that
category
if
i
could
nicely
drinkable
though
the
complexity
fights
off
a
bit
of
drinkability
d
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
trace
of
alcohol
is
perceptible
this
organic
beer
is
gold
in
color
topped
by
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
is
produced
by
an
solid
amount
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
floral
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
acidity
in
the
finish
this
is
quite
nice
light
and
refreshing
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
in
each
sip
the
most
important
things
for
me
in
a
saison
is
balance
and
drinkability
and
this
has
both
in
spades
very
enjoyable
and
organic
to
boot
easily
my
favorite
saison
so
far
drinkability
sessionable
d
insanely
quaffable
quite
refreshing
an
excellent
brew
from
start
to
finish
a
world
class
saison
i
highly
recommend
and
will
welcome
in
my
glass
without
hesitation
pours
a
brilliant
orange
into
my
watou
oversized
wine
glass
a
nice
fluffy
head
rests
gently
on
top
and
fades
slowly
with
a
little
bit
of
lace
left
behind
a
huge
musty
alcoholic
aroma
rises
out
of
the
glass
and
permeates
the
surrounding
area
which
is
a
good
thing
further
inspection
reveals
big
malts
and
fruits
some
straw
and
some
burnt
sugar
yeast
and
orange
peel
very
complex
and
very
promising
tastes
fruity
up
front
with
an
initially
creamy
mouthfeel
which
actually
finishes
dry
some
hop
bitterness
mingles
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
and
its
all
finished
with
a
big
malt
backbone
after
a
few
sips
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
presents
itself
mediumbodied
and
highly
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
theres
plenty
of
taste
but
it
goes
down
lightly
and
without
too
much
weighing
on
the
old
gut
excellent
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
taste
belgian
yeast
with
a
little
tart
fruitiness
towards
the
end
finishes
with
a
modest
spiciness
from
the
hops
cloudy
orangish
in
the
glass
with
a
neonwhite
head
that
last
long
enough
to
blast
you
in
the
face
with
yeast
and
dough
and
a
healthy
nostrilfilling
dose
of
oranges
and
lemons
with
a
little
clove
to
boot
plenty
of
all
this
in
the
taste
too
with
emphasis
on
hoppy
citrus
tones
that
compete
with
but
are
not
overshadowed
by
the
bread
the
spiciness
from
some
cinnamon
and
more
cloves
provides
a
nice
touch
at
the
edges
definitely
a
winner
but
no
surprise
its
from
bd
cant
lose
there
big
points
on
the
drinkability
although
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
the
flavor
i
will
be
getting
another
one
of
these
soon
a
slightly
softer
more
refined
beer
than
saison
dupont
both
are
great
in
their
own
rights
this
one
is
a
top
notch
saison
dvery
drinkable
indeed
i
might
go
get
some
more
of
this
along
with
exploring
the
style
more
in
other
offerings
especially
for
the
summertime
but
this
is
very
delightful
indeed
d
im
beginning
to
absolutely
love
saisons
i
think
this
summer
will
be
my
summer
of
saisons
this
beer
will
probably
make
a
come
back
for
the
summer
but
still
its
no
fantome
this
is
my
first
saison
style
which
i
am
happy
to
get
to
try
i
will
look
for
more
rich
creamy
mediumbodied
effervescent
and
zippy
all
at
once
quite
refreshing
a
good
balance
between
rustic
and
refined
another
solid
ale
from
dupont
overall
this
is
a
good
saison
but
dupont
does
better
and
this
is
more
of
a
nice
gateway
its
a
real
saison
not
some
filtered
chick
beer
from
a
macro
masquerading
as
a
saison
but
its
not
the
best
out
there
the
regular
dupont
and
the
avec
are
much
better
drink
but
do
not
seek
drink
id
go
for
their
standard
the
saison
dupont
before
id
pick
this
up
again
not
bad
just
not
good
enough
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
flavorful
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
balance
at
the
same
time
it
isnt
overwhelming
alcohol
wise
a
really
enjoyable
beer
to
savor
on
many
occasions
the
beer
ours
a
murky
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
not
a
very
attractive
beer
the
aroma
is
light
funk
with
some
strong
citrus
lemon
notes
the
flavor
is
lemon
funk
belgian
yeast
and
some
nice
sweetness
a
relatively
funky
saison
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
poured
a
corked
and
caged
750ml
into
my
hennepin
globe
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
butternut
squash
with
a
massive
4inch
fluffy
white
head
that
lasts
for
days
and
leaves
lacing
for
miles
brasserie
dupont
really
knows
what
a
saison
is
supposed
to
look
like
and
how
to
craft
a
saison
to
look
exactly
like
what
they
want
the
aroma
is
rather
intense
sour
green
apple
skins
mixed
with
pear
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
lemon
zest
also
whatever
strain
of
yeast
was
used
put
off
some
serious
spicy
notes
with
lots
of
white
pepper
a
bit
of
coriander
and
a
bit
of
clove
probably
the
most
unexpected
component
to
the
nose
was
the
amount
of
banana
that
was
present
when
my
wife
took
a
sip
it
was
the
first
thing
she
noticed
makes
me
wonder
if
there
is
some
kind
of
connection
between
a
hefe
yeast
and
the
ones
that
was
used
to
fermentcondition
this
one
the
flavor
is
just
as
intense
as
the
nose
big
bold
flavors
are
abound
but
equally
work
well
meshed
together
big
spice
up
front
with
coriander
clove
and
white
pepper
lots
of
fruit
presence
lemon
zest
orange
peel
green
apples
and
over
ripe
pears
the
hops
definitely
take
a
back
seat
in
this
saison
but
there
this
just
a
bit
of
grass
and
hay
also
there
is
a
bit
of
earth
and
funk
along
with
it
the
last
component
is
just
a
bit
of
green
bottle
funk
that
actually
adds
another
layer
to
the
complexity
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
carbonation
finishing
with
just
a
bit
of
dryness
this
is
a
great
beer
dupont
really
knows
how
to
make
a
saison
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
saison
but
nothing
really
stood
out
not
worth
seeking
out
but
definitely
worth
a
shot
really
wellrounded
beer
definitely
worth
revisiting
pours
a
golden
wheat
semihazed
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
does
recede
with
sticky
lacing
the
smell
is
cloveapples
pears
and
pepper
and
spice
nothing
strong
just
pleasant
the
taste
is
good
its
a
fruit
and
clove
start
with
other
fruits
like
plum
and
fig
followed
by
some
nice
hops
and
malt
and
yeast
i
found
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
a
tasty
saison
that
was
well
balanced
and
flavorful
a
nice
place
to
start
for
a
belgian
for
a
first
time
or
to
revisit
as
i
do
from
time
to
time
d
pretty
easy
going
down
for
7
5
i
like
this
one
alot
im
drinking
it
at
room
temp
right
now
and
im
really
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
being
chilled
good
beer
to
slowly
introduce
people
into
the
vast
world
of
delicious
belgian
beers
dgreat
food
beer
however
maybe
too
assertive
for
drinking
by
itself
poured
a
clear
golden
body
wiht
a
gushing
sticky
head
earthy
dirty
woody
are
among
the
aromas
i
noticed
along
with
some
funky
yeast
and
both
sweet
and
sour
fruit
notes
like
grapecherries
and
citric
really
light
and
sweet
the
beer
passes
over
the
tongue
smoothly
a
light
sugar
sweetness
combines
with
mild
fruit
notes
like
citrus
and
grape
for
a
wellbalanced
ale
that
has
a
tad
sour
dry
backbite
that
perfectly
complements
the
drink
a
great
beer
to
sip
d
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
a
good
brew
as
a
summer
quencher
yet
strong
enough
for
the
colder
months
as
well
i
started
reviewing
this
beer
when
it
was
still
fairly
cold
wait
for
it
to
warm
up
a
bit
and
enjoy
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
drink
it
again
d
very
drinkable
excellently
refreshing
crisp
and
fruity
nothing
mindblowing
but
solid
taste
is
a
bit
more
refined
nice
farmhouse
funk
but
not
overpowering
with
a
clean
kiss
of
hops
imminently
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyable
good
beer
11
2
oz
bottle
had
a
pretty
good
layer
of
dust
on
it
at
the
local
winebeer
superstore
bought
it
anyways
since
ive
never
had
a
farmhouse
ale
poured
to
glass
gentle
pour
brought
on
a
thick
white
head
very
aromatic
but
hard
to
pinpoint
what
im
getting
maybe
some
yeast
and
funk
a
little
sharpness
that
i
like
very
unique
flavor
but
again
i
like
it
mostly
getting
malt
and
a
little
sour
a
little
starchy
flavor
but
not
the
sweetness
i
thought
id
get
finishes
quite
dry
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
big
beer
but
i
get
almost
no
alcohol
flavors
despite
being
7
5
quite
a
trick
this
was
very
interesting
id
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
cheers
drinkability
keenly
drinkable
like
the
standard
version
though
i
would
say
this
is
just
a
tad
sweeter
usually
saison
dupont
is
my
goto
beer
for
thanksgiving
dinner
but
i
thought
id
mix
it
up
a
bit
this
year
it
all
worked
out
well
id
say
very
sturdy
and
impressive
for
being
aged
so
long
have
had
this
many
times
all
of
varying
ages
and
it
drinks
as
well
at
2
years
as
it
does
at
6
months
this
beer
is
a
classic
brownish
dark
orange
body
with
a
bright
white
head
of
one
finger
quite
turbid
good
lacing
sweet
fruity
smell
malty
and
a
good
yeast
portion
but
lacking
some
potency
has
some
really
dry
ethanol
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
but
the
overall
taste
is
like
a
less
juicy
tripel
it
has
the
same
sweetness
but
less
of
that
yeasty
body
the
aftertaste
has
a
big
bitter
component
that
lasts
a
couple
of
seconds
tastes
likes
bitter
astringent
hops
good
carbonation
and
a
well
balanced
body
very
traditional
and
i
love
it
dupont
knows
how
to
make
saisons
i
highly
recommend
this
quite
nice
complex
and
interesting
even
though
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
farmhouse
ales
drinkability
this
may
well
be
the
best
organic
beer
ive
had
a
chance
to
taste
it
has
excellent
drinkability
i
could
easily
sit
and
have
this
beer
all
evening
and
will
definitely
be
looking
for
this
again
it
may
not
be
the
best
saison
around
but
it
will
do
nicely
until
that
one
comes
along
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
great
ive
had
far
better
saisons
but
ive
seen
this
around
for
a
while
now
and
figured
as
im
trying
to
be
more
green
in
my
daily
life
that
it
was
worth
a
shot
ill
choose
a
different
beer
next
time
but
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
the
beer
is
exceedingly
carbonated
and
very
light
easy
to
drink
but
unfortunately
limited
to
11
2
ounce
bottles
i
was
prepared
for
disappointment
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
d
top
notch
very
similar
to
the
standard
saison
dupont
but
perhaps
a
shade
less
robust
all
and
all
a
refreshing
saison
that
typifies
why
this
style
is
a
favorite
of
mine
md
light
and
crisp
just
like
a
saison
should
be
very
easy
drinking
this
is
a
tasty
brew
great
flavors
traditional
to
the
style
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
wow
i
believe
my
bottle
is
pretty
fresh
this
saison
offers
it
all
great
job
light
to
medium
body
some
astringency
from
phenols
into
the
finish
w
crisp
carbonation
that
also
has
moments
of
fluffiness
and
creaminess
pours
a
perfect
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
aromas
and
tastes
are
perfect
for
a
saison
lots
of
yeast
and
slightly
spicy
malt
and
hop
balance
up
front
a
ton
of
funk
in
the
background
a
strong
dirtiness
sitting
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
for
the
duration
of
the
drink
feel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
love
the
style
and
this
is
a
perfect
highly
drinkable
example
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
trappist
in
oakland
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
lots
of
hop
aroma
and
a
healthy
dose
of
yeasty
spice
smells
delightful
drinks
extremely
easy
for
7
5
there
is
a
substantial
bitter
hopspice
flavor
that
sticks
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
all
said
its
a
nice
beer
i
would
order
it
again
produced
about
2
5
fingers
bright
white
foam
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
poor
to
no
lacing
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
apples
and
pears
there
is
a
huge
taste
of
yeast
wich
is
followed
by
a
pleasant
belt
of
hops
in
the
aftertase
this
beer
is
quite
lively
on
the
tongue
due
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
highly
reconmended
brew
notes
this
might
be
my
highest
rated
saison
i
did
not
check
yet
man
am
i
glad
that
i
found
this
at
heinens
anyone
reading
this
who
appreciates
saisons
should
seek
this
beer
out
a
real
treat
that
would
go
with
many
many
foods
but
most
especially
some
cheese
and
crackers
enjoyed
with
a
view
say
from
a
balcony
overlooking
the
farm
where
the
grains
were
grown
d
split
this
one
with
beerinator
at
a
restaurant
and
enjoyed
it
so
much
that
i
had
to
purchase
it
again
aftermath
this
may
be
my
favorite
saison
its
light
refreshing
if
you
want
you
could
swill
it
but
you
could
just
as
well
take
it
slow
letting
the
yeastybitter
finish
linger
between
sips
leaving
room
for
contemplation
i
would
not
mind
stocking
my
fridge
with
this
one
for
those
long
summer
nights
i
like
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
minimal
lacing
on
the
edges
aromas
of
coriander
banana
orange
peel
and
some
yeast
funk
taste
is
that
of
the
smell
creamy
banana
and
nice
orange
hints
very
creamy
gentle
mouthfeel
overall
pretty
drinkable
overall
but
i
have
had
better
saisons
drinkability
a
little
to
much
like
a
hefeweizen
for
my
taste
and
that
affects
the
score
a
little
here
an
interesting
drink
but
if
your
looking
for
a
true
sasion
you
best
look
elsewhere
overall
an
interesting
and
tangy
brew
i
think
i
might
have
liked
saison
dupont
a
bit
more
but
its
been
a
few
years
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
this
is
by
no
means
a
pictureperfect
saison
due
to
the
huge
saaz
and
pilsener
qualities
but
its
still
a
fine
quaff
and
with
warmth
gets
closer
to
the
style
benchmarks
aint
no
denying
that
its
a
fun
crisp
offering
to
truck
down
a
true
summer
treat
onstyle
or
not
wonder
what
brats
would
taste
like
when
we
boiled
em
in
this
probably
like
something
awesome
d
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
a
great
warm
weather
beer
d
this
is
actually
a
little
too
easy
drinking
as
though
it
were
watered
down
saison
i
feel
that
for
a
saison
this
could
use
a
bit
more
spice
to
offset
the
greater
earthiness
of
the
organic
malt
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
yellow
color
finished
on
top
with
thick
fluffy
3
finger
white
head
in
the
nose
there
is
lemon
yeast
peppery
notes
taste
is
crisp
citrusy
spicy
notes
not
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
but
respectable
a
pretty
easy
drinking
one
on
a
hot
day
has
a
pretty
light
body
for
the
abv
a
complex
yet
simple
brew
billed
as
an
organic
beer
i
guess
that
is
a
plus
if
you
are
looking
for
that
kind
of
thing
pours
a
very
light
colored
body
yellow
cloudy
and
fizzy
big
foamy
fluffy
head
and
big
bubbles
very
lasting
white
aroma
of
spiciness

perfumy

very

taste
light

very
tasty
light
and
somewhat
drying
very
tasty
effervescent
d
rather
good
but
vieille
provision
is
better
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
it
out
again
somewhat
more
bitter
than
other
saisons
it
does
serve
to
set
in
apart
in
an
enjoyable
way
d
quite
drinkable
not
an
easy
beer
to
find
but
definitely
worth
trying
d
not
as
good
as
saison
dupont
but
i
think
its
second
only
to
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
certainly
buy
it
again

the
beer
out
nicely
light
on
the

with
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
a
really
great
embodiment
of
the
style
only
critique
is
that
it
may
be
a
touch
too
sweet
this
beer
could
be
confused
for
a
triple
which
certainly
isnt
the
worst
insult
for
a
pale

wouldnt
hurt

the

are
so
amazing
i
could
drink
this
every
day
all

i
dont
a
fabulous
beer
and
fantastic
representative
of
the

it
doesnt
get
any
better

me

very
crisp
golden

it

foret
saison
has
a
cloudy
yellow
fizzy
appearance
smells
a
little
sweet
it
has
that
meaty
bubblegum
flavor
thats
kinda
nice
very
wheaty
has
a
medium
to
heavy
body
overall
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
would
totally
get
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
someone
who
like
beer
that
tastes
like
bubblegum
the
taste
is
crisp
and
light
a
bit
fizzy
but
soft
it
has
hints
of
lemon
grain
banana
pear
a
weak
hint
of
yeastiness
and
a
very
light
tartness
its
a
bnit
on
the
sweet
side
otherwise
and
has
some
definite
hefeweizenlike
character
the
aroma
is
very
fresh
fruit
similar
to
an
apple
cider
or
pears
there
is
a
very
pleasant
fruity
sweetness
at
first
the
very
peppery
hop
flavor
smacks
you
in
the
face
the
pear
and
apple
flavor
comes
through
after
the
pepper
dies
down
the
spicing
is
light
and
perhaps
not
enough
the
feel
is
crisp
and
tingly
from
the
carbonation
too
peppery
i
wouldnt
need
a
big
bottle
of
this
but
its
still
tasty
and
organic
goes
down
smooth
and
will
refresh

a
session

really
tasty
and
versatile
example
smooth

5
percent

i
like
it
nice
for
refreshing
taste
and
light
appearance
i
love
the
bits
of
seasoning
which
look
like
pepper
floating
in
the
beer
tastes
like
a
mix
of
a
belgian
blonde
beer
and
a
wheatwhite
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
do
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
to
try
something
a
bit
different
i
split
the
bottle
3
ways
with
my
wife
an
mother
and
we
were
all
super
happy
and
enjoyed
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
full
pillowtop
head
the
aroma
is
predominantly
skunky
funk
with
some
metallic
accents
and
a
little
citrus
the
skunk
doesnt
carry
over
to
the
taste
leaving
a
nice
bitter
earthiness
with
some
grassy
notes
and
a
hint
of
the
metallic
mineralness
overall
the
taste
is
pretty
good
however
the
smell
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
this
seems
like
a
wanna
be
saison
dupont
although
i
know
same
brewery
i
dont
know
if
organic
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
it
is
just
a
shadow
of
the
true
classic
not
bad
but
unless
you
are
really
green
no
reason
to
get
this
with
so
many
more
satisfying
saisons
out
there
pours
a
straw
with
magnificent
head
big
bellowing
and
consistent
and
creamy
white
and
very
lacy
nose
is
quite
yeasty
and
a
light
malt
of
sweet
a
sweet
ester
saison
with
the
taste
of
apples
hop
is
minty
and
astringent
robust
like
thyme
with
that
nice
light
pollen
musky
in
the
older
bottles
quite
basic
and
bare
but
simply
great
i
like
saisons
and
this
is
a
fantastic
blend
of
doughy
and
dry
poured
from
a
750ml
green
bottle
corked
and
caged
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
thick
wet
spitty
looking
head
the
beers
smells
are
mixed
mostly
funky
belgian
aromatics
but
with
a
bit
of
what
passes
for
skunk
maybe
it
is
skunked
or
maybe
its
an
intended
byproduct
i
cant
tell
the
taste
is
really
good
though
some
fruits
of
the
pearbananaapple
sorts
along
with
lots
of
yeasty
spiciness
very
delicious
i
dont
really
taste
skunk
but
i
still
smell
it
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
biting
more
like
pepper
than
bitterness
from
hops
the
body
is
mediumthick
very
nicely
done
d
a
nice
belgian
easy
to
drink
but
not
so
complex
as
others
can
be
some
nice
warm
flavours
come
as
it
warms
up
id
gladly
have
it
again
i
suppose
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
refreshing
and
solid
perhaps
a
tad
too
thin
in
mouthfeel
but
good
none
the
less
drinkability
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
ive
had
better
saisons
and
ive
had
worse
saisons
its
a
little
onedimensional
or
at
least
simplistic
but
whats
there
isnt
bad
only
my
2nd
dupont
beer
but
it
begs
the
question
where
has
dupont
been
all
my
life
consider
me
a
fan
great
stuff
body
is
medium
mouthfeel
crisp
yet
sort
of
flat
or
watery
in
a
desireable
sense
i
like
this
a
lot
very
drinkable
as
a
late
summer
beer
a
bit
too
bold
to
be
your
heat
wave
refresher
id
suggest
you
take
a
nice
salmon
filet
something
caught
wild
of
course
crack
some
salt
and
pepper
on
it
and
grill
it
with
a
few
green
peppers
and
sweet
onions
let
them
little
bastards
char
a
bit
throw
all
the
shit
into
a
dish
and
cover
it
then
get
out
your
shotgun
and
shoot
a
few
rounds
of
skeet
or
trap
maybe
just
put
some
big
ass
holes
in
the
side
of
a
refrigerator
box
with
a
chalk
outline
of
your
cousin
on
it
kill
off
a
case
of
shells
or
shoot
till
your
shoulder
cries
and
head
back
inside
make
up
a
nice
salad
using
fresh
spring
mix
the

sit

eat
the

or

bottles
of
this
here
beer
while

the

points
of
your

with

and
you
got
yourself
one
fine
autumn
afternoon
my
friend
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
very
true
to
style
this
beer
is
awesome
for
those
hot
summers
as
it
is
light
and
refreshing
nearly
the
ideal
saison
thats
sure
to
win
over
lovers
of
dry
white
wines
and
earthy
belgain
ales
forets
drinkability
is
limited
by
its
boldness
not
sure
if
this
would
benefit
from
some
aging
a
good
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
organic
offerings
available
nice
earthy
fruity
not
too
much
flavor
with
some
yeast
and
a
bit
of
grass
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
will
certainly
drink
again
drinkability
is
good
good
balance
really
a
classic
example
of
the
style
d
great
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
really
liked
the
increased
hoppiness
not
quite
as
complex
as
saison
dupont
but
very
well
crafted
and
very
tasty
great
beer
i
need
to
get
my
hands
on
more
beers
from
brasserie
dupont
i
really
need
say
nothing
other
than
that
this
is
textbook
saison
in
each
and
every
way
the
organic
certainly
hurt
nothing
and
is
a
trend
i
hope
will
catch
on
with
north
american
brewers
i
cant
help
but
feel
the
beer
was
aptly
named
because
i
could
easily
see
myself
packing
a
book
a
little
picnic
basket
of
food
the
bottle
of
foret
and
happily
spending
an
afternoon
sitting
under
a
tree
somewhere
in
fact
next
time
i
will
and
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
light
and
quirky
very
pleasant
very
tasty
i
like
it
of
the
three
saisons
ive
had
hennepin
le
merle
i
definitely
like
this
one
the
best
foret
is
the
beneficiary
of
magnificent
feel
and
drinkability
with
wonderful
flavors
and
spectacular
balance
mediumbodied
perfectly
carbonated
and
outstanding
in
every
way
i
can
think
of
this
beer
leaves
me
at
a
loss
for
superlative
words
to
describe
just
how
superior
this
drink
really
is
d
another
tasty
if
not
ovrwhelming
saison
from
dupont
would
be
a
really
good
food
beer
id
have
again
ontap
but
wouldnt
pop
the
9
bucks
for
a
bottle
the
taste
follows
through
big
earthymusky
tones
with
nice
yeasty
notes
corriander
clove
a
little
pepper
some
citrus
tartness
all
in
a
medium
bodied
medium
carbonated
package
and
it
finishes
delightfully
dry
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
yeah
its
not
exactly
a
lightweight
in
the
abv
department
but
still
i
cant
stop
taking
sip
after
sip
and
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
when
it
is
done
right
this
one
fits
that
bill
no
pun
intended
thanks

with
a
tight
2
5
inch
offwhite
head
excellent
retention
head
eventually
settled
but
remained
tight
leaving
behind
strands
of
fluffy

inviting
scent
of
citrus
and
yeast
as
well
as
a
slight
grassy
presence
taste
consistent
with

as
well
as
some

mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
with
a
noticeable
tingle
on
the

and
a
nice
clean
finish
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
astringency
and
a
mild
hops
presence
at
the
finish
i
have
been
drinking
many
saisons
lately
and
foret
is
definitely
in
my
top
5
this
beer
has
a
high
drinkability
i
personally
havent
experienced
too
many
saisonsfarmhouse
ales
but
this
beer
certainly
encourages
me
to
try
more
great
saison
complex
flavor
profile
but
light
enjoy
to
enjoy
without
thinking
too
much
perfect
on
a
warm
day
i
bet
d
complex
beer
that
is
perhaps
too
subtle
in
many
aspects
much
different
from
the
regular
saison
dupont
with
lambic
overtones
as
for
the
taste
floral
hops
get
backed
by
a
tropical
fruit
yeastiness
and
pale
belgian
malts
a
bitter
lingering
grass
note
clings
to
the
back
of
the
palate
excellent
carbonation
in
this
one
and
the
medium
body
is
refreshing
when
it
warms
and
loses
a
bit
of
the
bubbliness
foret
gets
even
better
as
gooey
caramel
malts
start
to
dominate
the
flavor
at
only
7
5
abv
this
beer
is
easy
to
put
away
i
finished
off
the
bottle
without
much
of
a
problem
however
it
has
the
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
and
wanting
more
i
will
surely
be
purchasing
this
again
a
nice
beer
however
alcohol
is
a
little
too
high
for
the
other
characteristics
ill
look
for
this
again
just
in
case
this
one
was
passed
its
prime
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
i
havent
had
this
brew
in
a
while
and
im
really
glad
i
revisited
it
picked
the
perfect
day
as
well
sitting
in
my
backyard
on
a
nice
summer
friday
evening
with
gorgeous
weather
d
damn
fine
complex
yet
quite
easy
to
drink
and
this
from
a
bottle
that
was
most
likely
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
this
one
is
a
nobrainer
for
me
from
now
on
i
have
been
noticing
this
saison
at
a
local
store
for
awhile
and
just
got
around
to
actually
buying
one
neat
label
with
animals
in
a
foret
forest
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
turbid
orange
murkiness
which
is
probably
from
suspended
yeast
as
there
is
a
chalky
sediment
settling
to
the
bottom
of
my
snifter
it
smells
spicy
peppery
oddly
like
flower
pollen
and
brown
sugar
there
is
a
slight
sourness
towards
the
back
and
a
slippery
pepper
taste
and
feel
followed
by
subtle
apple
flavors
like
watered
down
apple
juice
i
was
surprised
that
this
actually
paired
decently
with
sharp
cheddar
but
it
was
good
pours
hazy
straw
color
nice
retentive
lacing
of
a
white
head
aromas
of
slight
spicy
hops
buttery
and
citrusy
taste

of
citrus
hops
slight
spicy

a
little
yeasty
taste
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
light
bodied
low
ot
medium
carbonation
slight
dry
finish
yet
long
aftertaste
for
an
organic

pretty
damn
tasty
saison
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
magnificent
large
fluffy
white
head
smell
reeks
of
barnyard
funkiness
and
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
with
pepper
yeast
bread
much
more
peppery
than
the
regular
dupont
some
spice
in
here
as
well
with
the
barnyard
farmhouse
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
but
slightly
thin
and
maybe
just
a
tiny
touch
overcarbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
much
as
good
as
a
saison
gets
with
the
exception
of
a
select
few
a
fantastic
organic
brew
by
brasserie
dupont
one
i
will
certainly
buy
again
great
beer
wow
i
cannot
believe
how
much
i
love
this
beer
the
perfect
saison
the
spicy
freshness
of
the
hops
really
jump
right
out
and
refresh
you
with
their
bitter
but
smooth
descent
down
your
gullet
it
is
rich
smooth
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
no
easy
feat
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
anything
but
subtle
they
jump
right
out
but
are
followed
by
a
very
mellow
aftertaste
that
balances
it
out
perfectly
theres
a
lot
of
citrus
and
banana
in
this
beer
its
very
spicy
and
has
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
topnotch
saison
and
one
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
had
a
better
organic
beer
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
saisons
recommended
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
this
thing
is
spicy
and
biting
the
bite
is
a
little
too
strong
id
say
but
other
than
that
its
quite
drinkable
overall
more
please
and
its
organic
to
boot
pours
a
beautiful
golden
saisson
with
a
thick
head
that
slowly
disapates
tiny
bubbles
form
at
the
top
waiting
for
me
to
sip
scent
of
peach
and
pears
very
smooth
on
the
palate
with
bubbles
that
burst
on
the
tongue
paired
with
a
nice
turkey
dinner
this
will
do
nicely
a
piece
of
belgian
love
very
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
7

abv
lots
of
peppery
yeastiness
i
like
it
probably
a
great
beer
my
palate
isnt

both
rounded

and
a

verdict
a
decent
example
of
a
saisonfarmhouse
ale
ive
had
enough
examples
already
that
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
another
still
i
like
this
one
d
as
much
as
i
love
this
beer
i
couldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
and
again

with

but
not
as
many

as
the
vieille

taste
was
a
nice
combination
between
some
floral

with
some
bready

which
also
provided
a
slightly
spicy
finish
full
body
with
some
great

and
no

another
great
beer
from
this
fine
brewery
very
enjoyable
interesting
and
peppery
beer
d
i
personally
find
saisons
to
be
the
most
drinkable
of
the
belgians
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
could
easily
put
back
several
of
these
witch
is
interesting
considering
its
a
relatively
high
7

its
also

how
can
you
lose
pours
cloudy
pale
orange
with
heavy
lacing
and
a
short
creamy
head
nose
is
a
little
grassy
and
alcoholy
the
beer
is
rather
strong
in
flavor
with
a
lot
of
heavy
herbal
and
fruitiness
along
with
some
noticeable
alcohols
a
bit
too
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
on
par
with
the
style
overall
i
feel
it
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
and
flavorful
but
is
definitely
a
decent
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
dry
yeastiness
and
somewhat
skunky
in
the
taste
very
dry
yeasty
and
a
small
hint
of
skunkiness
a
small
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
yeasty
aftertaste
very
dry
and
yeasty
however
the
small
skunkiness
throws
me
off
a
very
nice
very
solid
beer
from
dupont
fairly
drinkable
crisp
and
dry
drinkability
a
good
beer
bio
in
the
style
saison
noble
beer
i
should
add
whether
you
get
an
aged
bottle
or
a
fresh
bottle
both
are
very
good
in
their
own
way
really
hoppy
fresh
cidery
with
some
attic
quality
aged
you
cant
go
wrong
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
can
taste
the
clove
some
bitterness
some
tropical
fruit
more
banana
than
citrus
i
think
of
a
combo
lemon
meringue
pie
pumpkin
pie
when
its
past
the
tongue
thats
a
good
thing
and
this
is
a
beer
i
really
like
id
say
its
as
good
as
the
saison
dupont
but
with
a
more
attractive
lable
an
excellent
example
of
the
saison
style
pours
a
hazy
golden
copper
with
a
huge
rocky
white
long
lasting
head
lacing
left
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
earthy
and
herbal
with
a
bit
of
funk
in
the
background
tastes
spicy
and
peppery
with
some
herbal
and
fruity
notes
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
warming
overall
an
excellent
brew
i
could
drink
these
all
night
i
must
admit
that
belgian
saison
is
one
of
my
favourite
styles
and
this
i
feel
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
saison
should
be
it
poured
a
cloudy
egg
yolk
yelloworange
with
a
snow
white
head
and
plenty
of
fine
grains
of
sediment
the
smells
is
pleasantly
musty
like
a
damp
basement
and
a
bit
yeasty
as
well
the
taste
is
more
bitter
than
sour
but
good
nonetheless
saison
dupont
is
the
benchmark
by
which
i
judge
all
other
belgian
saisons
and
this
one
is
close
but
not
quite
very
tasty
though
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
right
about
where
i
feel
it
should
be
for
the
style
as
i
stated
before
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
glad
i
tried
it
a
wonderful
true
belgian
saison
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
exploring
the
other
dupont
offerings
taste
of
solvent
pretty
hot
alcohol
and
estery
green
apples
i
dont
really
like
this
estery
part
of
the
beer
to
me
it
appears
that
a
lot
of
sugar
has
been
used
but
it
could
easily
be
the
yeast
a
moderate
bitter
which
could
be
better
and
more
hoppy
the
malt
brings
some
honey
and
apricot
taste
drinkability
is
not
great
due
to
the
hot
alcohol
recommended
nicely
done
with
organics
as
well
the
organic
claims
made
on
the
label
of
this
beer
intrigued
me
i
tasted
this
beer
in
a
large
16
ounce
goblet
and
after
pouring
noticed
immediately
its
unique
mandarin
color
the
head
was
frothy
and
chunky
with
red
specks
dappling
its
tufts
from
the
yeast
poured
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
smelled
citrusy
and
earthy
but
the
somewhat
negligible
hop
aroma
was
overpowered
by
the
yeast
which
clearly
is
meant
to
be
the
focus
of
the
beers
multifaceted
character
the
first
taste
reached
my
palate
with
a
somewhat
flowery
complex
flavor
bringing
with
it
additional
aromas
that
only
served
to
improve
its
initial
impression
on
me
a
second
taste
revealed
a
smooth
nicelycarbonated
and
refreshing
flavor
that
was
perfectly
textured
to
my
preferences
i
felt
compelled
to
drink
this
beer
slowly
because
the
spicy
notes
in
the
taste
and
aroma
kept
me
constantly
searching
for
descriptors
but
it
is
certainly
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
beer
poured
a
nice
pale
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
diminished
to
a
ring
and
left
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
fruits
with
some
yeast
the
taste
had
a
good
sweetness
to
it
with
a
great
bit
of
orange
there
was
also
a
very
nice
yeast
bite
to
it
the
beer
is
rather
light
bodied
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
saison
i
cant
say
id
strongly
recommend
this
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
finishes
rather
sweet
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
saison
with
high
drinkability
poured
in
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
a
2
eggshell
head
over
the
clearish
orangey
gold
brew
head
holds
steady
for
quite
some
time
fueled
by
bubbling
deep
in
the
glass
with
lots
of
heavy
foamed
lacing
aroma
is
effervescent
lightly
spiced
with
some
earthiness
taste
is
sweet
malts
upfront
some
spiciness
in
the
middle
and
a
bitter
close
mouthfeel
is
extra
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
dont
really
care
that
its
organic
but
good
for
them
that
made
a
very
nice
beer
and
could
still
follow
those
guidelines
overall
a
good
saison
but
not
exceptional
this
one
tastes
a
bit
too
biting
for
me
i
like
my
saisons
mellow
and
smooth
worth
a
try
taste
followed
the
nose
more
esters
and
yeast
smooth
taste
and
real
nice
finish
usually
the
saison
gets
too
rich
for
me
farther
along
the
tasting
but
this
one
finished
nice
drinkability
this
is
a
beginners
saison
and
very
drinkable
really
smooth
and
tasty
dont
let
the
hazy
cloudy
appearance
fool
you
big
head
and
perfectly
carbonated
this
brew
gives
off
the
aromas
that
get
my
gears
turning
i
smell
earthy
peppery
lemony
even
barnyard
animally
i
know
it
sounds
wierd
but
this
one
evokes
memories
of
smells
that
remind
me
of
the
best
days
of
my
life
summertime
harvest
time
goes
incredibally
well
in
my
opinion
with
sharp
cheese
queso
valdeon
5
year
cheddar
gouda
funky
soft
french
stuff
chicken
pizza
and
everything
else
unsweet
def
not
an
appertif
dont
sleep
on
this
one
especially
when
its
fresh
at
any
rate
the
wild
yeastfarmhouse
yeast
lends
a
spicy
complexity
to
it
that
is
simply
refreshing
as
i
write
this
on
a
humid
and
sweltering
memorial
day
afternoon
in
nyc
i
could
not
think
of
a
more
perfect
beer
to
quench
my
thirst
d
this
beer
has
a
dry
crisp
fresh
quality
with
a
nice
peppery
spice
and
a
big
club
soda
note
with
a
hint
of
tonic
quality
there
is
a
nice
hoppyness
but
not
much
in
flavor
more
in
spicy
qualities
d
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
it
is
another
great
saison
from
dupont
i
never
would
have
guessed
they
have
two
2008
11
2
oz
bottle
seemed
a
bit
more
thin
bland
and
metallic
that
what
i
remember
from
the
750
bottle
reviewed
above
there
was
a
sweetness
and
alcoholic
dryness
to
it
but
it
was
missing
the
subtle
fruit
mentioned
above
pours
perfectly
clear
the
first
pour
from
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
soft
fine
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
very
aromatic
with
lots
of
fruity
esters
orange
blossom
and
spicy
notes
nutmeg
that
match
up
with
pale
malts
styrian
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
note
its
the
dupont
yeast
strain
all
the
way
on
the
palate
big
juicy
carbonation
with
fine
pinprick
bubbles
fills
the
mouth
hop
bitterness
is
pronounced
but
not
overpowering
sumptuous
fruits
oranges
again
and
a
hint
of
bubblegum
round
things
out
there
are
plenty
of
sweet
flavors
in
there
but
the
beer
remains
dry
thanks
to
the
high
hop
content
and
the
relatively
light
body
spoton
for
the
saison
style
and
full
of
delectable
flavors
this
is
very
good
stuff
as
a
bonus
im
not
a
big
follower
of
organic
beers
by
any
means
but
from
the
limited
number
of
them
that
ive
had
this
is
easily
the
best
one
puffy
fluffy
head
cloudy
straw
color
aroma
of
yeasty
fruitearth
and
lemongrass
tasted
deliciously
soft
earthy
spicyfloral
quenching
i
wanted
to
sit
out
in
a
field
on
a
blanket
with
some
cheese
fruit
and
bread
i
wanted
to
quit
my
job
and
drink
every
morning
this
beer
inspired
me
perfect
for
spring
afternoons
and
summer
mornings
corked
and
caged
750ml
bottle
with
the
year
2006
printed
on
the
cork
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
has
notes
of
banana
and
clove
sweet
and
sour
fruit
malt
and
a
touch
of
honey
and
spices
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
some
citrus
up
front
and
a
dry
hoppy
finish
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
saisons
and
this
one
is
certainly
one
of
the
upper
tier
brews
within
the
style
not
quite
as
good
as
saison
dupont
but
delicious
in
its
own
right
recommended
wonderfully
drinkable
stuff
ive
been
going
through
a
case
of
these
with
various
dinners
and
it
pairs
well
with
most
light
meals
chicken
fish
risotto
etc
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
golddark
straw
color
with
a
billowy
white
foamy
head
reminding
me
of
clouds
solid
sustainance
in
the
head
aroma
is
of
sour
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
orange
peel
a
bit
of
coriander
hits
my
nose
as
well
and
a
bit
of
pepper
a
mild
sweetness
overall
on
the
nose
that
blends
well
with
a
bitterness
that
is
hard
to
describe
sipping
reveals
in
interesting
blend
of
orange
and
grapefruit
flavors
as
well
as
soem
spice
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
balance
the
sweetness
a
bit
of
alcohol
hits
the
sides
of
my
tongue
and
the
finish
winds
up
with
a
grapefruit
sweetness
with
some
alcohol
phenols
sticking
around
medium
bodied
and
solid
brew
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
solid
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
the
organically
produced
saison
from
dupont
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
lots
of
lacing
which
makes
this
a
good
looking
brew
smell
is
very
spicy
with
lots
of
pepper
aroma
somewhat
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
to
it
and
a
slight
funk
which
is
true
to
style
taste
followed
smell
but
thought
it
could
use
some
more
fruitiness
to
balance
out
the
spiciness
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
do
try
this
with
strong
cheese
because
it
is
very
complementary
and
you
will
like
the
beer
particularly
well
thereafter
just
try
to
get
beyond
mr
pepe
lpew
at
the
start
of
your
session
lchaim
11
2oz
bottle
this
pours
a
darker
golden
color
there
is
a
small
white
head
on
it
which
tends
to
linger
awhile
a
lighter
but
nice
aroma
of
spices
fruits
and
bread
a
very
good
taste
it
has
a
medium
body
and
i
get
notes
of
citrus
and
spiciness
just
a
touch
sweet
with
actually
a
note
of
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
another
beer
from
dupont
worth
having
here
is
where
it
stops
being
a
conscientious
review
and
i
get
ugly
the
beer
has
a
flavor
towards
the
end
that
i
can
only
describe
as
off
it
has
a
respectable
flavor
to
a
point
but
the
finish
is
not
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
maybe
it
is
my
knee
jerk
reaction
to
the
organic
ingredients
although
ive
had
other
organic
brews
that
were
quite
tasty
i
cant
really
get
past
this
flavor
so
the
review
ends
here
its
not
going
down
the
drain
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
future
please
excuse
the
review
as
it
will
basically
be
a
reminder
for
me
to
not
buy
again
cheers
good
quality
stuff
notes
loved
it
not
as
dry
as
i
would
have
liked
but
that
is
splitting
hairs
damn
good
offering
and
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorites
drink
this
as
fresh
as
possible
as
this
ultra
fresh
offering
is
better
than
any
ive
had
to
date
glad
to
finally
get
into
my
fourth
offering
from
dupont
like
its
sisters
foret
is
a
looker
hazy
blonde
body
with
a
huge
frothy
white
rocky
head
she
smells
nice
too
flowery
and
spicey
with
just
a
touch
of
that
rough
funk
taste
is
along
the
lines
of
duponts
other
offerings
but
is
maybe
a
bit
heavy
in
the
peppery
spice
element
noticably
lesser
than
other
dupont
beers
in
this
category
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
off
seems
somewhat
thin
and
sharp
carbonation
is
damaging
drinkability
is
hurt
by
this
but
hurt
even
more
by
simple
comparison
with
its
sisters
worth
a
try
and
if
this
were
the
only
saison
available
to
me
id
drink
it
but
its
not
poured
from
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
the
cork
had
2
006
on
it
which
im
assuming
meant
bottled
in
2006
but
not
sure
why
the
weird
period
it
had
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
i
did
a
slow
pour
so
not
to
unsettle
the
yeast
so
not
a
big
head
but
a
decent
one
for
the
pour
also
had
a
bunch
of
carb
and
a
lot
pop
when
opening
the
smell
was
very
weak
and
had
a
dryness
to
it
didnt
really
excite
me
the
taste
was
also
kinda
off
and
had
a
very
dry
and
bitter
ending
based
on
other
reviews
im
either
just
not
getting
it
or
have
a
bad
sample
overall
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
and
hoping
its
just
a
bad
sample
as
im
really
into
saisons
lately
and
this
is
one
i
could
get
fairly
easily
for
now
dont
really
recommend
3
5
rb
ml
o
dupont
foret
on
my
750
ml
bottle
priced
at
8
99
from
my
local
north
coast
coop
here
in
eureka
ca
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fat
white
head
and
big
chucks
of
lacing
nose
of
hops
spices
and
citrus
mouthfeel
kind
of
average
and
taste
is
same
as
nose
only
slightly
sweet
decent
slightly
dry
finish
an
interesting
and
tasty
blond
ale
from
moinette
spicy
and
peppery
with
a
huge
fresh
fruit
character
on
the
nose
id
say
this
would
be
a
great
beer
with
food
hadnt
had
this
in
quite
some
time
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
good
it
was
much
better
than
i
remembered
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
with
not
much
head
almost
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
its
so
cloudy
the
smellis
of
beautiful
belgian
yeast
aromas
of
cloves
and
bubblegum
the
taste
is
crisp
and
a
little
bitter
up
front
from
hops
followed
by
a
deep
flavor
of
bubblegum
very
balanced
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
still
solid
and
quite
refreshing
fairly
high
carbonation
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
style
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
day
another
plus
is
that
this
is
an
organic
beer
good
brew
and
i
dig
the
organic
aspect
drinkability
tasty
and
balanced
with
a
nice
bitterness
d
very
tasty
saison
do
the
organic
ingredients
have
anything
to
do
with
that
not
sure
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
tasting
brew
especially
for
the
price
this
is
a
nice
mellow
saison
cloudy
strawcolored
pillowy
white
head
the
nose
is
similar
to
the
taste
dry
citric
some
yeasty
funk
in
the
background
much
heavier
on
the
malt
than
the
hops
sweetness
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
up
not
the
most
complex
saison
out
there
but
very
drinkable
stuff
pretty
light
and
easy
on
the
palate
but
still
very
flavorful
muted
spice
but
some
expected
funk
a
very
good
beer
not
a
great
one
id
buy
it
again
its
an
enjoyable
basic
saison
but
not
inspiring
one
note
i
found
this
beer
significantly
improved
with
a
little
bit
of
time
sitting
out
it
mellowed
some
of
the
astringentsharp
sensation
i
felt
during
some
of
the
early
drinking
drinkability
was
high
because
of
this
d
a
good
saison
such
as
this
is
emminently
drinkable
paired
nicely
with
a
teriyaki
stirfry
poured
out
a
hazy
burnt
amber
color
with
thick
foamy
head
light
lacing
the
nose
is
strong
and
earthy
with
a
medicinalherbal
feature
rounding
out
the
citrus
the
taste
is
sweet
with
honey
upfront
hoppy
and
dry
throughout
citrusy
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
crisp
and
dry
but
not
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
really
work
d
it
is
a
good
saison
i
wouldnt
say
its
one
of
the
best
but
if
someone
had
it
i
would
have
it
but
i
would
go
with
the
saison
dupont
over
this
if
it
were
up
to
me
has
a
few
weird
notes
in
the
taste
but
overal
pretty
good
poured
from
a
750
ml
into
a
tulip
glass
big
foamy
head
very
airy
and
light
the
color
is
a
cloudy
pale
golden
hue
just
picture
perfect
the
aroma
is
peppery
spicy
hoppy
flowery
and
it
really
gets
my
taste
buds
watering
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
upfront
only
for
a
second
and
then
the
sweet
wheated
malt
and
malts
break
in
there
is
a
pleasent
sweetness
to
this
brew
their
is
a
slight
sour
faded
flavor
that
is
quite
nice
the
body
is
medium
the
brew
is
great
but
one
750
ml
is
enough
at
one
time
its
even
better
to
share
with
a
friend
very
pleasant
beer
well
worth
giving
a
shot
taking
this
for
what
it
is
without
expectation
its
very
good
and
i
really
enjoy
it
a
milder
saison
is
a
welcome
change
of
pace
i
thought
the
aroma
was
a
bit
funky
with
all
the
yeast
and
found
this
to
be
a
beer
best
sipped
slowly
other
than
that
its
a
very
tasty
brew
id
love
to
try
this
in
a
fresher
condition
it
has
hints
of
delicacy
that
cannot
be
perceived
in
this
condition
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
grains
and
flowers
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
teh
finish
was
smooth
and
contained
a
slight
alcohol
bite
overally
this
was
a
light
and
reasonably
nice
refreshing
beer
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
example
of
a
saison
fruity
funky
and
spicey
recommended
foret
pours
tremendously
foamy
from
a
brown
33cl
bottle
the
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
in
color
and
the
enormous
head
is
white
i
like
the
aroma
a
lot
it
is
almost
floral
with
a
light
citrus
touch
it
takes
a
long
time
for
the
head
to
die
down
i
like
the
smell
better
than
the
taste
it
has
some
qualities
that
i
dont
particularly
like
a
plastic
like
taste
is
noticeable
at
some
points
its
not
bad
just
not
outstanding
definitely
worth
a
try
750
ml
bottle
injet
information
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
label
but
it
was
not
legible
2005
on
cork
overall
an
easily
drinkable
flavorful
saison
ale
that
nears
perfection
ever
had
saison
dupont
this
tastes
very
similiar
now
i
see
that
it
is
from
the
same
brewery
so
that
makes
sense
some
sweet
malt
lots
of
pepper
and
spice
banana
flavors
still
evident
in
the
taste
quite
dry
lots
of
pepper
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
really
tasty
if
i
wasnt
there
for
a
beer
tasting
i
could
have
stuck
with
this
all
night
this
goes
to
the
top
of
my
saison
list
foret
is
french
for
forest
which
should
be
easy
to
figure
out
due
to
the
bucolic
scene
depicted
on
the
label
its
too
bad
that
this
lively
little
belgian
ale
doesnt
come
in
750
ml
bottles
like
just
about
every
other
saison
in
existence
or
if
it
does
its
too
bad
that
i
ended
up
with
this
puny
11
2
ouncer
because
its
a
corker
of
a
beer
that
disappeared
waaay
too
quickly
to
the
extent
that
my
heart
is
warmed
by
the
organic
nature
of
the
beers
cheers
to
a
solid
saison
still
it
tasted
pretty
good
and
i
think
it
would
match
well
with
pork
chops
or
a
bbqd
ham
and
a
healthy
side
of
greens
and
corn
bread
im
going
to
have
to
try
some
more
saisons
and
come
back
to
this
one
to
truly
understand
what
my
senses
are
going
through
right
now
and
whether
its
more
characteristic
of
the
style
or
this
particular
brew
in
fact
after
this
experience
the
saison
dupont
i
despised
so
much
on
my
first
tasting
now
clearly
deserves
a
second
chance
drinks
pretty
good
about
average
as
far
a
saisons
go
goes
down
too
easy
during
this
colorado
hail
storm
a
good
effort
but
a
tad
over
priced
9
50
for
750ml
bottle
imo
pours
a
brilliant
brass
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
tiny
bubbles
rushing
through
the
body
and
ornate
lacing
smell
is
of
light
spices
and
yeast
with
a
grainy
malt
body
grassy
hops
really
stand
out
as
well
as
some
candied
fruit
flavor
is
really
light
with
an
emphasis
on
some
faint
sweetness
and
some
grainy
character
some
light
spicy
and
fruity
yeastiness
is
there
as
well
as
some
really
earthy
hops
and
a
solid
finishing
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
certain
fluffiness
to
it
bubbles
are
really
active
leaves
the
mouth
just
a
little
sticky
this
is
a
good
beer
but
im
just
not
that
compelled
to
drink
more
and
more
overall
i
feel
that
this
is
too
sweet
and
not
as
refreshing
as
other
saisons
that
i
have
had
not
bad
by
any
means
d
definately
a
warm
weather
beer
not
bad
jasmine

me

bottle
served
in
a

on

priceless
the

poured
a
hazy

to

color
with
a
thick
crisp
creamy
white

with
active

calling
my

yeast
very
earthy
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
but
also
has
a
nice
sweet
character
with
a
good
body
of
carbonation
i
imagine
this
would
go
very
well
with
japanese
food
but
i
had
it
this
night
with
grilled
chicken
and
shrimp
and
it
was
a
very
good
match
overall
tasty
stuff
at
least
fresh
from
the
brewery
listed
at
a
lower
strength
than
the
moinette
blond
and
brune
and
a
different
brewed
beer
in
its
own
right
distinctly
dupont
sort
of
a
spicy
hop
laden
triplesaison
it
seems
like
it
is
hard
to
find
but
well
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
to
drop
on
a
bottle
or
two
wish
i
had
more
750
ml
bottle
no
date
evident
poured
into
a
tulip
pours
a
hazy
glowing
apricot
with
a
mammoth
three
finger
offwhite
head
which
lingers
for
a
long
time
at
least
5
minutes
until
its
subsided
enough
for
a
sip
which
isnt
all
bad
since
the
aroma
is
enough
to
enjoy
on
its
own
a
pleasant
earthy
yeasty
slightly
spicey
background
infused
with
all
sorts
of
fruits
from
mango
to
coconut
to
lemon
to
strawberryits
wonderful
and
complex
and
slightly
different
with
every
whiff
taste
is
absolutely
brimming
with
that
same
fruitiness
a
great
light
banquet
of
orange
melon
banana
berry
coconuta
slight
bit
of
honey
sweetness
all
giving
way
to
a
big
clove
and
pepper
spiceyness
finishes
with
a
lingering
fruity
yeast
making
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
absolutely
creamy
feel
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
original
saison
du
pont
but
this
organic
beer
is
absolutely
superb
and
i
will
definitely
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
in
the
future
d
high
great
to
pound
well
bodied
pours
out
a
cloudy
orangeamber
color
with
a
substantial
compact
lasting
head
nose
is
a
dusty
sawdustlike
grassy
hop
aroma
with
light
fruitiness
lots
of
wheat
at
first
taste
with
substantial
hoppiness
and
a
yeasty
clove
flavor
lurking
around
in
the
background
finishes
delightfully
tart
and
dry
medium

with
a
neutral
but
wellcarbonated
texture
pours
a

with
a
3
finger
chynky
and
fluffy
head
clarity
is
moderate
with
a
nuce
fine
carbonation
bubbling
up

is
interesting
im
getting
a
lot
of
earthy
mustyness
with
lemony
citrus
light
orange
rind
and
a
spicey
yeast
character
initially
there
was
a
solid
hallertau
hop
character
but
this
fades
and
is
more
subtle
after
the
beer
breaths
a
bit
flavor
is
pretty
nice
good
sharp
lemony
sour
is
dominant
initially
moving
towards
a
mustyness
with
good
orange
rind
finishing
with
a
solid
blast
of
hallertau
hop
that
is
very
herbal
and
lingers
just
long
enough
i
think
this
is
a
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
lightmoderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
a
good
balance
all
together
this
one
works
well
for
me
i
like
the
hop
profile
on
this
one
the
mustyness
and
sour
tang
are
just
enough
to
balance
out
the
nice
fruity
and
spicey
notes
id
have
this
one
around
all
summer
if
i
could
afford
it
overall
quite
tasty
light
peach
the
aroma
is
fairly
subtle
but
perfect
for
a
saison
in
my
opinion
its
very
fruity
spicy
and
highlights
fragrances
of
cantaloupe
bubble
gum
peach
caramel
and
clove
a
bready
caramel
like
maltiness
is
evident
as
well
ill
be
the
first
one
to
admit
that
i
am
a
huge
saison
freak
but
this
one
is
especially
characterful
i
love
duponts
yeast
which
is
why
i
am
currently
having
a
love
affair
with
blaugies
as
well
the
bittering
hops
play
a
profound
role
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
slightly
tart
and
ripe
fruitiness
and
notes
of
cinnamon
orange
nutmeg
clove
toffee
and
caramel
a
lovely
saison
big
offwhite
head
sits
atop
a
hazy
yellow
body
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
and
slightly
funky
followed
by
insense
and
herbs
herbs
and
spices
combine
with
evergreen
elements
and
some
more
of
that
skunk
it
would
be
out
of
place
in
another
beer
perhaps
but
hey
this
is
saison
and
like
the
others
this
offers
its
own
nuances
and
pleasures
it
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
very
long
time
it
also
had
a
white
bubbly
lace
around
the
glass
this
beer
was
extremely
carbonated
the
beer
had
a
wonderful
fruitful
taste
that
hit
the
tongue
first
it
fallowed
with
light
hops
and
a
slightly
bitter
peppery
finish
it
was
very
wonderful
beer
the
cork
popped
like
a
champagne
and
was
very
enjoyable
highly
recommended
organic
too
taste
starts
off
a
bit
grassy
with
a
little
sweet
honey
and
then
the
lemony
citrus
flavors
come
out
some
as
this
beer
gets
warmer
it
becomes
slightly
sweeter
that
barnyard
funk
comes
out
more
in
the
finish
along
with
a
good
peppery
spiciness
that
i
really
like
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
having
many
less
than
satisfactory
experiences
with
organic
beers
im
very
happy
to
report
that
this
is
a
saison
that
will
not
disappoint
provided
it
has
had
the
proper
time
toage
i
just
love
saison
i
could
drink
this
stuff
forever
this
one
is
right
there
with
the
best
of
them
its
citrusy
spicy
and
delicious
its
a
very
creamy
middle
and
a
firm
ending
this
is
a
complete
beer
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
high
alcohol
drinkability
lack
of
sweet
balance
makes
it
slightly
less
drinkable
but
hard
to
take
points
away
as
this
is
right
on
the
money
for
a
saison
ale
give
it
some
time
and
the
flavor
starts
to
round
itself
out
nicely
the
color
is
a
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
head
is
large
and
offwhite
lemon
zest
is
first
noted
in
the
aroma
a
deeper
inhale
reveals
a
yeasty
clove
aroma
mixed
with
spices
taste
features
a
big
citrus
flavor
a
lemonyorange
combo
very
acidic
spice
flavor
is
high
and
works
well
with
the
citrussy
aspects
of
this
beer
sweetness
is
underlying
and
is
joined
by
yeasty
flavors
in
the
finish
as
foret
warms
up
the
yeast
flavors
become
stronger
and
clove
flavor
stands
out
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
slightly
puckering
drinkability
is
high
oh
yeah
and
be
careful
with
the
yeast
normally
i
just
dump
the
yeast
in
with
my
last
glass
not
recommended
in
this
case
the
flavours
are
too
delicate
keep
it
pure
it
is
beautiful
as
it
is
i
guess
the
key
phrase
with
this
beer
is
yeah
its
alright
but
ive
had
some
better
saisons
classy
lively
simple
yet
refined
bring
it
on
and
enjoy
out
of
a
wine
glass
flavor
has
some
cooked
banana
some
sour
and
a
little
pepper
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
quite
good
since
it
is
so
mellow
and
refreshing
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
rather
enjoyed
it
but
reallythere
is
no
reason
or
me
to
buy
this
one
at
twice
the
price
of
the
hennepin
when
that
saison
is
so
much
better
i
think
this
is
a
sweet
beer
nor
per
say
a
saison
but
they
could
be
anywhere
on
the
spectrum
a
light
body
and
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
good
sweeter
beer
drinkability
is
also
good
but
there
are
better
not
a
bad
saison
but
hennepin
and
dupont
are
better
versions
sort
of
pricey
at
9
for
the
bottle
for
a
beer
just
to
drink
i
suggest
you
take
your
9
and
buy
two
bottles
of
hennepin
instead
if
you
can
find
this
one
i
would
recommend
getting
it
the
overall
flavor
is
big
and
married
nicely
in
fact
i
was
able
to
enjoy
foret
before
during
and
after
a
good
meal
i
also
like
the
fact
that
brasserie
dupont
put
such
emphasis
on
organic
and
natural
ingredients
in
crafting
this
fine
beer
ill
be
buying
more
opinion
i
am
one
that
will
try
anything
from
dupont
at
least
three
times
before
making
a
judgment
these
beers
are
so
complex
that
you
cant
make
an
opinion
up
from
just
one
tasting
i
think
that
i
like
their
moinette
blond
a
bit
better
than
this
one
but
this
is
still
a
fabulous
beer
perhaps
a
touch
more
earthy
than
saison
dupont
similarly
light
and
pleasing
but
not
the
same
degree
of
complexity
definite
hops
present
on
the
palate
a
tad
tinny
aftertaste
and
even
a
bit
dry
mouthfeel
was
light
this
would
be
a
perfect
late
summer
brew
as
it
was
90
degrees
last
night
out
on
the
deck
it
was
just
short
of
perfect
finished
spicey
weirdly
enough
we
were
watching
a
movie
afterward
and
i
could
have
sworn
that
the
beer
left
a
smokeyashey
flavor
in
my
mouth
i
never
know
what
to
expect
with
the
saison
brews
worthy
of
having
another
pours
a
perfectly
clear
gold
and
with
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
and
head
lacey
strings
are
all
over
the
glass
noce
is
hops
and
spices
the
alcohol
is
not
very
well
hidden
behind
the
flavor
and
is
very
much
up
and
in
your
face
the
alcohol
is
trying
to
hide
behind
cinnamon
and
pepper
flavors
but
is
too
big
the
hops
also
have
a
pretty
good
bittering
kick
mouthfeel
is
more
of
the
heavy
carbonation
however
all
in
all
it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
because
the
spie
flavors
are
quite
good
a
pretty
decent
saison
but
not
my
favorite
needs
a
bit
of
toning
down
in
some
areas
pretty
nice
saison
sort
of
a
bigger
more
astringent
earthy
version
of
saison
dupont
not
as
fruity
as
saison
dupont
but
overall
a
really
nice
beer
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
and
smooth
finishes
moderately
dry
this
would
be
much
more
drinkable
if
it
didnt
taste
like
i
was
licking
a
horse
with
each
drink
the
latefinish
is
quite
sweet
like
saison
dupont
as
is
the
initial
taste
but
every
part
in
between
seems
a
bit
too
funky
to
be
too
highly
drinkable
drinkable
to
be
sure
but
cost
prohibitive
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
style
if
im
gonna
pay
that
much
ill
stick
with
chimay
body
is
medium
dense
with
a
crisp
yet
airy
texture
accented
by
rolling
carbonation
crisp
and
dry
yet
fruity
and
full
very
excellent
beer
another
nice
saison
from
dupont
this
lived
up
to
my
expectations
sitting
in
my
80
degree
house
with
humidity
nearing
70
and
its
almost
10
in
the
evening
you
can
be
assured
this
helped
to
ease
the
pain
not
really
impressed
with
this
ale
when
poured
the
color
was
of
a
hazy
wheat
and
foam
was
of
a
medium
tight
nature
with
very
little
lace
the
smell
of
spice
with
a
hint
of
fruit
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
mostly
of
spice
especially
corriander
drank
it
was
it
was
40
degress
and
50
degress
when
a
little
warmer
the
flavor
seem
to
be
of
a
fruity
taste
of
orange
blossoms
but
for
me
it
was
just
average
all
around
drinkability
ive
put
off
buying
a
bottle
of
this
because
all
ive
seen
in
the
past
was
the
750ml
bottles
for
8
99
and
upwards
plus
i
have
heard
things
to
make
me
believe
that
this
bottle
was
not
worth
paying
the
price
and
lacks
the
presence
of
better
saisons
well
i
can
see
where
they
come
from
as
this
tasted
a
bit
more
like
a
wit
to
me
and
it
doesnt
compare
to
fantome
saison
which
is
my
favorite
saison
to
date
but
overall
its
pretty
damn
tasty
and
wouldnt
mind
snagging
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
and
putting
them
away
for
those
nice
summer
family
picnics
or
something
tasty
and
fullfilling
drinkability
as
i
drink
this
i
cant
help
but
imagine
a
mellow
breezy
afternoon
picnic
in
the
hills
overlooking
the
pacific
the
sun
giving
the
oaks
and
grass
a
golden
glow
so
nice
so
nice
uh
oh
very
drinkable
and
a
decent
deal
to
boot
good
stuff
very
enjoyable
and
had
the
desireable
yeast
and
carbonation
characteristics
of
the
other
duponts
i
have
had
refreshing
and
lasting
peppery
aftertaste
somewhat
sweet
fruity
and
acidic
with
a
spiciness
pours
actively
carbonated
and
significant
yeast
before
settling
amber
cork
reads
2004
about
half
a
dozen
streamers
of
carbonation
weave
through
this
matte
bronze
liquid
with
dank
goldenrod
highlights
the
offwhite
head
is
tight
and
controlled
consisting
of
bubbles
that
range
in
size
from
merely
small
to
truly
microscopic
the
lacing
isnt
particularly
impressive
though
aromas
are
okay
suggesting
an
earthy
blend
of
white
bread
dough
and
peach
baby
food
with
a
finish
of
lemon
pudding
but
calling
them
subtle
is
a
big
understatement
so
how
is
it
that
firtree
hoppiness
is
slamming
the
back
of
my
nose
yeast
is
tangible
in
the
nosefeel
flavors
involve
twiggy
tarragonlike
bitterness
citric
peel
and
capers
but
the
palate
itself
seems
remarkably
subdued
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
to
the
point
of
being
foamy
neither
as
spicy
as
dupont
nor
as
quenching
as
hennepin
i
appreciate
the
thinking
behind
this
organic
brew
but
the
end
result
just
isnt
spirited
enough
to
hold
my
interest
drinkability
and
overall
not
a
bad
saison
but
no
saison
dupont
its
not
as
drinkable
as
other
saisons
but
i
could
still
enjoy
this
one
for
a
while
cloudy
and
orangeyyellow
with
a
few
bubbles
seen
rising
up
to
a
nice
creamy
froth
of
foamy
head
in
a
thick
layering
with
some
medium
sized
bubbles
nicely
cellard
scents
malty
and
yeasty
silky
with
a
bit
of
bite
at
the
end
from
the
carbonation
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
wonderfully
dry
great
flavors
bit
of
chardonnay
touch
of
red
apple
skin
and
grape
skin
just
such
great
flavor
and
feel
after
having
a
glass
by
itself
i
paired
foret
up
with
some
fontina
cheese
green
grapes
and
sea
salt
crackers
it
was
outstanding
foret
has
an
easy
drinkability
thanks
to
the
plethora
of
flavors
and
the
wellconcealed
alcohol
content
another
standout
offering
from
brasserie
dupont
presentation
packaged
in
a
330
ml
eurostyle
brown
glass
longneck
with
a
poptop
crown
served
in
a
chalice
glass
hazy
peachy
gold
in
hue
when
backlit
the
liquid
is
magnificent
it
is
like
a
sunset
in
a
glass
the
head
was
white
in
color
at
the
apex
the
foam
was
two
fingers
in
height
the
rocky
mass
of
bubbles
had
great
staying
power
in
fact
a
thin
cap
lasted
the
entire
consumption
there
was
some
subsequent
lacing
it
was
spotty
and
unorganized
on
top
of
that
it
didnt
cling
all
that
well
still
on
the
whole
this
beer
looks
very
appealing
eyecandy
the
nose
is
terrific
there
is
a
tremendous
rounded
quality
about
the
bouquet
that
i
adore
the
fruitiness
is
heavy
on
melons
like
honeydew
and
cantaloupe
i
even
find
kisses
of
berries
apple
cider
and
oranges
in
the
mix
is
a
good
amount
of
natural
smelling
honey
coriander
juicy
up
to
this
point
the
aromas
are
very
appealing
and
lovely
to
sniff
however
there
is
nothing
strong
or
funky
about
the
nose
at
the
end
that
changes
for
the
better
at
the
back
is
a
healthy
does
of
phenols
cloves
medical
aromas
herbal
yeasty
funk
like
i
am
allergic
to
hay
and
mold
while
sitting
in
an
abandon
barn
that
once
was
home
to
broncos
did
i
mention
i
was
at
this
barn
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
hell
yeah
the
potency
is
moderate
but
it
is
very
articulate
i
like
what
it
is
saying
it
says
drink
me
it
is
about
time
i
do
the
palate
is
interesting
in
parts
it
is
raw
and
aggressive
and
in
other
parts
it
is
weak
and
fragile
does
that
mean
there
is
balance
im
not
sure
the
weaker
flavors
are
louder
and
the
stronger
flavors
are
secondary
it
is
hard
to
explain
that
the
dominant
flavors
cant
outshine
the
secondary
tastes
odd
so
what
am
i
talking
about
the
fruity
sensations
like
orange
cantaloupe
and
apples
are
unimpressively
tasty
they
offer
something
to
sink
my
teeth
into
but
it
is
far
from
memorable
unfortunately
this
is
the
strongest
taste
i
really
like
the
raw
honey
flavor
in
the
middle
this
is
followed
by
a
blast
of
pepper
coriander
grass
and
some
bubblegum
funky
there
are
medicinal
qualities
at
the
finish
with
kisses
of
alcoholic
heat
the
finish
is
fairly
forceful
but
it
fails
to
outshine
the
fruitiness
how
odd
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bit
of
everything
i
mentioned
above
at
this
point
it
is
a
little
sweet
how
interesting
ive
gone
this
far
in
the
review
without
using
the
words
hops
or
malt

maybe
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
im
joking
or
am
i
no
really
im
joking
i
like
this
beers
flavor
profile
medium
in
body
with
fairly
lively
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fitting
for
this
beer
it
is
active
yet
lazy
it
is
assertive
but
restrained
it
is
crazy
it
is
odd
it
is
wacky
just
like
the
palate
it
is
a
match
made
in
heaven
overall
this
saison
is
a
bit
mellow
but
it
is
far
from
boring
i
really
liked
this
beer
give
me
a
hand
of
grapes
and
some
mild
cheddar
cheese
and
i
am
one
happy
sob
i
purchased
this
beer
in
minnesota
mn
and
left
it
in
the
cellar
because
well
i
forgot
it
was
there
what
a
dope
whatever
this
beer
is
very
good
and
i
think
i
can
get
more
in
iowa
city
maybe
kansas
city
regardless
i
will
get
more
i
am
a
sucker
for
saisons

this

enjoyed
this

yummy
all
in

a
nice

and
a
good

with
my

i
would

it
would
also
be
good
with
shellfish
and
other
seafood
pours
to
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white

that
leave
a
nice
amount
of

the
aroma
is
yeasty
grassy
and
a
bit
spicy
there
is
a
bit
of
citrus
fruits
and
pepper
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
peppery
and
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
malt
the
flavor
is
just
not
up
there
with
the
aroma
it
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinking
it
has
a
drying
finish
not
too
bad
glad
to
have
tried
this
once
i
doubt
i
would
have
it
again
the
addition
of
some
of
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
really
mellowed
out
the
flavor
and
brought
this
beer
from
a
3
0
to
a
3
5
in
the
taste
catagory
it
gained
some
spiciness
and
yeast
flavors
as
well
as
provided
a
little
more
depth
it
also
knocked
down
the
alcohol
flavor
which
i
found
to
be
distracting
without
the
yeast
hazy
light
amber
body
with
a
sizeable
and
lasting
head
theres
a
lot
of
dried
stone
fruit
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
flavor
has
the
same
fruit
profile
with
something
a
little
softer
pear
maybe
toward
the
end
you
get
a
bit
of
dry
hay
malt
despite
the
fact
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
mildly
sweet

deeeelicious
once
i
discovered
that
hennepin
which
i
really
likeis
a
saison
i
decided
to
try
more
of
the
style
i
found
the
dupont
and
the
foret
on
a
beer
run
this
weekend
my
wife
and
i
split
the
foret
tonight
and
we
both
loved
it
clean
crisp
and
tangy
pours
with
a
medium
sized
fizzy
head
citrus
notes
reasonably
carbonated
but
not
too
much
so
has
a
similar
tartness
to
duvel
in
a
way
which
is
my
favorite
at
least
as
good
as
the
hennepin
imo
great
aroma
leaps
from
the
bottle
taste
is
just
as
good
i
have
the
dupont
in
the
beer
fridge
cant
wait
to
try
it
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
citrusy
notes
other
flavors
include
cinnamon
and
orange
blossom
it
sits
very
much
like
a
belgian
trippel
in
the
mouth
very
light
and
fluffy
with
well
balanced
carbonation
the
only
downfall
to
this
bottle
was
the
bittery
skunky
ending
i
would
have
to
chalk
it
up
to
poor
storage
and
being
light
struck
taste
a
strange
mix
of
anis
and
orange
with
light
carbonation
and
decent
mouthfeel
a
very
good
saison
that
ill
definately
try
again
a
tart

it

from
the
competition
it

up
against
that
night

not
a

by

overall

nice

and
i
can
see
the
refreshing
qualities
and
can
admire
the
mostly
hidden
alcohol
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
complex
flavor
something
really
unique
to
help
me
identify
saison
in
the
future
all
i
got
now
is
wit

went
well
with
my
summer
salad
a
good
thirst
quencher
poured
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
receded
somewhat
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
of
damp
musty
hay
hint
of
grassy
hops
sweet
malt
and
a
pleasant
fruitiness
this
beer
is
quite
fullbodied
with
lots
of
residual
sweetness
balanced
by
a
pleasant
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
hint
of
mild
spiciness
from
the
yeast
rounds
out
the
flavor
very
nicely
very
tasty
i
will
buy
more

get

color
with
a
thick
frothy
white

that
slowly
fades
to

the
aroma

good
it
has
a
nice
pale

scent
with
a
banana
clove
aroma
and
a
fruity
belgian

finish
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
spicey
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
pepper
undertones
and
a
slight
hop
character
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
with
a
fruity
belgian
yeast
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
saison
it
is
true
to
style
and
full
of
spicey
flavor
i
got
a
little
tired
of
this
by
the
end
as
it
didnt
seem
to
evolve
much
from
the
start
and
i
would
order
a
different
saison
moinette
for
sure
if
i
was
having
another
saison
drinks
a
little
to
easily
considering
the
7

it
could
sneak
up
on
you
a
good
although
relatively
simple
beer
loud
pop
of
the
cork
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
a
thick
rocky

forms
on
top
i
notice
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floating
about
in
my

aroma
has
citrusy
grassy
notes
to
it
the
taste
reveals
some
the
slight
hop
taste
earthy
tones
and
lemony
tartness
as
expected
from
a
saison
i
do
detect
some
spice
perhaps
some
peppery
flavors
this
is
a
smooth
and
refreshing
example
of
the
style
a
very
good
beer
the
head
is
dense
creamywhite
with
a
remarkable
flat

to

aftertaste

some
as
you
go
leaving

beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
very
light
and
one
dimensional
but
highly
refreshing
pours
brilliantly
clear
and
a
full
gold
color
the
beer
is
topped
by
a
thick
cream
colored
head
that
is
produced
by
an
incredible
amount
of
carbonation
aromas
of
grain
and
a
floral
characteristic
reminiscent
of
a
field
of
blooming
weeds
both
soft
and
sharp
floral
aromatics
competing
for
attention
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
acidity
in
the
finish
the
ample
carbonation
prickles
my
tongue
there
is
a
light
grainy
sweetness
up
front
but
the
finish
is
quite
dry
quite
nice
with
a
good
amount
of
character
derived
from
the
yeast
i
get
notes
of
pepper
grass
tropical
fruit
pineapple
clove
and
a
herbal
character
this
is
quite
nice
light
and
refreshing
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
in
each
sip
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
rocky

very
good

retention
and
excellent

sweet
aroma
of
honey
and
malt
with
subtle
spiciness
in
the
backround
taste
was
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
the
malt
is
nicely
balanced
by
a
sharp
but
not
overpowering
hop
flavor
some
spice
and
earthy
notes
are
also
present
and
the
alcohol
peeks
through
just
a
bit
light
on
the
tounge
and
very
smooth
quite
drinkable
but
it
seems
like
something
was
missing
pretty
good
though
after
trying
this
one
i
see
more
saisons
in
my
future
pours
a
hazed
burnt
orange
with
a
massive
noisey
white
head
the
aroma
consists
of
a
light
lemon
twang
with
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
is
that
of
sweet
fruit
spices
from
light
hops
and
finishes
in
the
middle
of
dry

sweet
the
body

light

fairly
easy

this

in

minutes
it
took
to

the

poured
a
cloudy

color
that
when
held
to
the
light
was
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
formed
was
super
fluffy
white
in
color
and
the
consistency
was
sticky
and
dense
and
it
lasted
for
the
whole
glass
only
falling
a
little
great
lace
sticky
as
the
foam
that
it
comes
from
it
was
in
thick
sheet
form
to
very
delicate
sheets

lace
the
aromas
were
of
ripened
fruits
apples
pears
some
fresh
hops
wheat
and
its
grains
some
malt
over

impression
was

started
off

as
it

earth

the
body
was

over

impression
was
earthy
wheaty
and
organic
a
simple
beer
but
it
can
stand
on
its
own
very
well
this
was
my
first
organic
beer
and
i
must
say
that
i
rather
enjoyed
it
and
will
try
again
paid

overall
impression
im
a
huge
fan
of

dupont
and
as
such
i
would
have
liked
to
rate
this
beer
higher
but
this
one
was
a
bit
disappointing
not
because
its
bad
it
just
doesnt
quite
agree
with
me
but
perhaps
this
eencyweency
25cl
bottle
of
it
just
doesnt
give
much
chance
to
taste
it
although
i
sampled
a
longstored
and
refrigerated
bottle
the
carbonation
immediately
brought
up
the
yeast
sediment
and
it
poured
a
very
hazy
gold
with
an
orange
cast
and
billowing
swirls
of
effervescent
bubbles
beneath
a
huge
head
of
rocky
offwhite
foam
the
head
retention
was
more
than
impressive
it
held
a
small
cap
throughout
the
entire
glass
and
it
left
some
excellent
lacing
beautiful
jagged
rings
and
walls
its
candyish
nose
was
quite
welcoming
but
a
bit
deceptive
as
the
flavor
was
actually
much
less
sweet
balanced
by
a
bold
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
airy
and
quite
smooth
with
just
a
gentle
caress
on
the
tongue
considering
its
zesty
effervescence
in
the
flavor
some
candyish
and
honeylike
malt
was
overshadowed
by
a
brisk
bitterness
leafy
hop
flavor
and
a
slap
of
spice
it
finished
dry
with
a
mild
grainysweet
note
a
touch
of
light
phenolic
plasticsmoke
and
a
lingering
delicate
spiciness
drinkability

this
went
down
slow
its
light
of
course
but
dull
and
overly
spiced

nice
looking

some

blanket
aromas
with
sour
yeast
and

esters
not
especially
impressive
as
for
the
flavors
a
doughy
malt
and
yeast
combination
dominates
along
with
a
good
deal
of
fruitiness
mostly
apricot
and
plum
hops
show
up
on
the
edges
of
the

theres
just
a
little
barnyard
in
there
plumskin
bitterness
hits
in
the
dry

and
coats
the
mouth
in
the
aftertaste
smooth
in

front
but
a
bit
sharp
in
the
back
not
a
bad
saison
but
not
the
best
still
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
quite
sibylline
orange
color
with
the
head
unpresumptuous
in
size
the
texture
creamy
and
the
color
a
bright

the

formed
is

taste
shows
me
some
floral

that
control
the
flow
of
flavors
other
flavors
are
earthy

malts
and
peppery
spices
finishes
with
a
hop
kick
and
some
more
spice
which
seems
to
be
cardamom
this
time
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
esp
for
an
organic
but
the
style
just
doesnt
seem
that
great
to
me
this
is
a
good
beer
that
falls
shy
of
greatness
i
love
saisons
and
flemish
golden
ales
and
bieredegardes
and
farmhouse
ales
and
so
on
but
this
is
an
average
in
that
category
still
above
average
as
a
beer
all
around
i
guess
i
never
loved
saison
dupont
and
thats
a
world
class
brew
this
is
not
but
has
the
added
appeal
of
being
organic
opaque
peachy
golden
with
lots
of
bubbles
little
lasting
head
aroma
of
yeast
spice
and
fruit
a
fair
amount
of
euroskunkiness
from
the
green
bottle
that
lingered
even
in
aftertaste
the
malt
profile
is
very
soft
buttery
weisslike
but
the
hops
kick
in
quite
sharply
and
set
off
the
equally
prickly
yeast
finish
is
spicy
peppery
cleansing
went
very
nicely
with
a
sharp
irish
cheese
but
did
not
advance
to
the
next
stage
of
transcendence
ill
drink
this
again
sure
but
im
not
giving
it
a
whole
hearted
recommendation
again
though
i
found
myself
wishing
that
an
organic
beer
would
mean
one
that
really
tasted
fantastic
not
just
pretty
good
the
taste
was
more
or
less
what
i
expected
and
its
a
little
weak
up
front
not
quite
as
great
as
some
other
belgians
but
its
still
quite
good
and
pretty
drinkable
notes
a
simple
beer
i
expected
a
bit
more
rough
around
the
edges
showing
some
withdrawn
complexities
there
are
other
saisons
out
there
that
are
better

manages
to
pull
off
the

herbs
without

those
spices
just
made
my
pallet
tingle
i
loved
this
the
spices
that
were
in
it
threw
me
off
but
it
was
great
i
want
more
cloudy
and
golden
with
fluffy
white
head
smelled
citrusy
hops
and
honey
maybe
some
stone
fruits
peach
couldnt
pick
out
herbs
at
all
which
really
confused
me
but
i
did
get
some
spice
white
pepper
in
the
finish
almost
like
a
gruner
veltliner
i
bought
this
beer
because
the
concept
interested
me
i
dont
feel
that
dfh
delivered
this
time
dogfish
head
knows
what
they
are
doing
loved
it
so
much
i
copied
the
recipe
for
homebrew
is
this
really
a
saison
though
it
drinks
like
a
belgian
i
did
not
enjoy
this
o
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
building
off
a
solidly
produced
saison
base
this
beer
delivers
enough
of
its
herb
themes
to
evidence
its
commitment
to
these
ingredients
without
allowing
them
to
undermine
the
drinking
experience
not
necessarily
something
id
grab
often
this
is
still
a
well
executed
beer
really
nice
clear
yellow
color
with
thick
head
nose
is
really
odd
ive
seen
some
really
interesting
descriptions
for
the
smells
from
saisons
but
this
one
is
tough
for
me
im
not
opposed
to
some
funk
as
a
saison
should
be
be
the
herbs
really
give
it
an
unpleasant
initial
impression
almost
a
drain
pour
now
the
taste
completely
different
ballgame
actually
quite
pleasant
good
mouthfeeel
citrusy
light
one
of
the
first
beers
where
im
disconnected
from
the
smell
and
taste
physiologically
not
sure
how
that
happens
but
it
did
wouldnt
buy
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
if
purchased
for
me
overall
it
is
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
that
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
and
it
doesnt
currently
leave
me
craving
for
another
however
it
is
very
well
crafted
and
leaves
enough
room
in
the
overall
flavor
that
the
spice
in
the
beer
doesnt
consume
it
entirely
i
would
not
recommend
it
specifically
to
saison
drinkers
but
rather
to
pale
ale
and
ipa
drinkers
who
are
always
searching
for
new
hop
flavors
specifically
herbal
ones
this
actually
does
a
fair
job
of
scratching
the
itch
for
new
hop
flavors
even
though
it
is
predominantly
flavored
through
cooking
herbs
i
would
recommend
it
overall
this
is
a
very
delicious
outstanding
american
version
of
a
belgian
saison
it
has
great
balanced
flavors
of
toasted
malt
spices
citrus
funk
and
hoppy
bitterness
highly
highly
recommended
o
very
enjoyable
ale
pair
with
italian
food
another
great
dogfish
head
theyve
got
it
figured
out
a
total
drain
pour
for
me
i
could
not
even
get
through
my
5
oz
tasting
glass
glad
i
just
bought
1
this
one
is
not
for
me
good
pour
with
a
solid
head
but
of
an
off
smell
but
that
may
be
the
glass
that
i
am
using
nothing
special
about
the
look
or
color
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
peppery
taste
on
the
back
end
overall
very
solid
and
worth
buying
i
got
it
for
just
2
95
for
a
12
oz
bottle
champagne
mouth
feel
this
was
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
classic
saison
i
commend
the
trio
of
breweries
use
of
unusual
ingredients
in
the
brew
pot
to
literally
spice
things
up
a
bit
i
cant
wait
to
get
a
hold
of
the
other
two
brewerys
versions
and
see
how
they
compare
id
recommend
drinking
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
to
preserve
that
great
herbal
character
from
the
added
herbs
mouthfeel
is
light
very
very
dry
overall
i
like
it
serving
type
bottle
overall
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
into
saisons
herbed
beers
or
bizarre
experiments
but
its
not
something
id
buy
in
a
four
or
six
pack
final
score
3
83
overall
a
pretty
good
and
very
unique
saison
id
definitely
recommend
picking
one
up
when
you
can
o
not
a
saison
but
intriguing
would
you
expect
anything
less
from
these
two
herbs

hops

but
too
much
herbs
for
me
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
herb
worked
well
with
it
and
they
werent
overpowering
when
it
came
to
the
taste
but
there
was
nothing
about
it
that
really
wowed
me
i
thought
it
was
nice
but
it
wasnt
anything
special
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
crisp
slightly
prickly
dry
on
the
finish
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
doesnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
i
dont
have
any
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
good
and
i
thought
the
aroma
was
pretty
unique
and
a
little
intense
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
the
drinkability
they
held
this
beer
back
a
little
and
they
could
use
a
little
work
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
feel
the
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
and
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
great
saison
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
the
combination
of
herbs
with
this
saison
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
something
that
really
wowed
me
and
in
the
end
i
wanted
a
little
more
out
of
this
beer
its
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
beer
and
its
for
sure
not
a
favorite
of
the
style
i
appreciate
the
effort
it
took
to
make
this
beer
keep
up
the
solid
and
unique
work

poured

a
nice
full

a

hade
some

with
the
most
pronounced
being

also
had
some

full

aftertaste
this
beer
would
go
great
with
a
roasted
chicken
o
distinct
and
solid
likely
wont
become
a
regular
but
worth
a
try
ive
got
the
feeling
that
this
is
an
aged
bottle
and
for
how
long
i
do
not
know
stated
solely
because
of
the
timeliness
of
my
encountering
it
the
spices
are
not
only
st
patricks
dayfriendly
but
canadian
thanksgiving
as
well
so
this
is
a
seasonal
offering
in
a
manner
of
speaking
at
any
rate
nice
to
finally
have
gotten
the
chance
to
hit
this
particular
dfh
collaboration
overall
i
have
the
impression
they
mellowed
this
out
from
the
initial
offering
i
realize
im
probably
imagining
it
i
recall
the
spices
really
reminding
me
more
of
thanksgiving
maybe
just
the
sage
was
a
bit
stronger
the
smells
and
tastes
were
never
overpowering
but
they
are
muted
in
this
pour
a
decent
beer
that
i
can
leave
until
next
years
offering
to
try
again
not
being
an
ipa
this
beer
was
very
smooth
and
great
taste
o
has
a
nice
character
to
it
the
ingredients
complement
each
other
well
in
this
saison
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
3
8
othe
components
are
representative
of
the
style
with
a
nice
herbal
touch
that
comes
through
in
greater
quantities
with
each
sip3
75
o
even
though
i
found
this
brew
very
interesting
and
unique
the
addition
of
the
herbal
spices
wasnt
great
a
more
citrusy
touch
and
a
less
herbal
touch
would
make
this
beer
better
in
my
opinion
still
refreshing
not
as
much
as
other
saisons
but
very
unique
i
would
have
this
again
but
there
are
many
other
saisons
i
would
pick
over
this
one
3
5
brilliant
golden
with
a
moderate
ivory
head
notes
of
lemon
thyme
and
rosemary
are
accompanied
by
a
touch
of
must
and
sage
flavor
is
savory
with
sage
and
parsley
cleanliness
forming
the
base
and
lemon
and
thyme
hitting
mid
palate
rosemary
carries
into
the
lightly
bitter
finish
and
notes
of
mint
nice
savory
beer
that
ill
buy
again
and
hold
back
for
thanksgiving
dinner
finishing
creamydry
the
beers
relative
medium
body
is
slow
to
relax
and
is
content
to
retain
low
levels
of
malt
sweetness
and
firm
textures
to
linger
on
the
palate
this
buffers
the
effect
of
its
sprucy
perfume
and
might
be
somewhat
of
its
saving
grace
the
beer
sipper
overall
im
really
not
crazy
about
it
not
fresh
anyway
i
had
a
bottle
of
stones
version
that
had
been
aged
about
15
months
the
other
week
i
enjoyed
a
lot
more
the
herbal
notes
were
quite
faded
albeit
still
present
theres
much
stronger
lemon
and
citrus
tastes
which
really
hijack
the
beer
and
change
it
for
the
better
imo
if
i
see
anymore
of
these
around
ill
snatch
a
couple
to
lay
down
for
a
year
id
give
it
overall
a
3
5
fresh
and
a
4
aged
so
for
the
overall
score
i
met
in
the
middle
pours
hazy
and
yellow
with
a
soft
pastel
lightness
to
the
appearance
a
fat
white
head
of
foam
that
never
falls
completely
and
leaves
lots
of
bubbles
in
a
layer
on
top
nose
is
light
sweet
biscuit
and
a
sugary
smell
form
malt
then
some
savory
herbal
from
the
herbs
that
have
been
added
the
nose
is
open
and
airy
and
light
some
hop
floral
taste
is
excellent
it
has
a
a
delicate
malt
with
a
soft
and
silken
body
a
few
bubbles
and
an
overall
creaminess
the
malt
is
a
sweeetned
biscuit
and
the
herbs
are
prominent
the
sage
stands
out
the
most
and
i
love
sage
they
tickle
the
palate
and
make
you
think
of
herbal
teas
the
malt
sweetness
stands
side
by
side
with
the
herbs
so
that
they
do
not
become
too
pungent
or
loud
in
the
drink
there
is
a
sweet
bit
of
lemon
peel
that
comes
forward
as
this
warms
and
again
in
the
after
taste
this
beer
has
an
all
over
dryness
and
finishes
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
flavor
as
much
as
in
the
mouthfeel
the
sweet
lemon
resonates
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
herbs
i
loved
this
and
thought
it
was
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
had
in
this
style
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
from
three
great
breweries
would
i
have
it
again
maybe
but
im
not
running
out
the
door
in
my
boxer
shorts
to
get
more
overall
a
complex
drinking
experience
o
excellent
brew
it
remains
still
one
of
my
favourite
saisons
i
had
the
stone
version
over
a
year
and
a
half
ago
and
like
this
version
equally
drank
july
30th
2014
in
pensacola
fl
o
this
is
a
weird
beer
its
no
dupont
thats
for
sure
but
it
still
manages
to
carve
out
a
niche
for
itself
its
intense
seemingly
imbalanced
spice
quotient
is
what
gives
it
its
charm
worth
a
try
o
very
unique
the
spices
really
offset
the
sweetness
nicely
very
interesting
for
a
saison
but
certainly
enjoyable
o
first
saison
i
have
tried
very
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
the
spice
additions
added
interesting
complex
flavors
without
being
overwhelming
i
would
like
to
try
stones
rendition
for
comparison
o
not
my
favorite
saison
but
an
interesting
and
drinkable
take
on
the
style
good
enough
that
ill
look
for
the
same
beer
from
stone
just
to
see
how
they
compare
overall
i
get
what
these
three
were
doing
but
the
herbs
were
way
too
much
for
my
palate
o
the
herbs
are
skillfully
balanced
and
blend
well
with
the
crisp
and
refreshing
americanized
saison
style
underneath
i
personally
love
these
things
was
very
happy
to
see
them
again
after
a
2
year
hiatus
o
interesting
as
standalone
drink
pairing
might
be
good
with
something
uncomplicated
or
cheese
as
youd
want
to
taste
the
herbal
nuances
in
the
beer
it
is
not
something
id
run
back
to
purchase
but
as
a
novelty
its
definitely
worth
the
experience
very
interesting
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
light
head
the
smell
was
easily
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
it
feels
like
you
are
directly
smelling
parsley
and
thyme
very
big
notes
from
the
earthy
herbs
the
taste
was
a
little
lackluster
though
with
big
herb
tastes
in
the
beginning
but
i
felt
the
ending
wasnt
as
good
and
the
sour
taste
at
the
end
while
enjoyable
didnt
leave
a
great
lingering
taste
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
try
and
appreciate
the
inventive
style
of
dogfish
but
i
dont
know
if
i
need
more
than
one
the
taste
is
full
of
herbal
notes
with
a
tart
almost
sour
bite
at
the
finish
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
will
certainly
satisfy
foody
beer
nerds
a
bold
yet
sophisticated
use
of
herbs
helps
to
elevate
this
saison
to
the
likes
of
a
true
culinary
experience
overallcomments
this
was
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
that
allows
the
drinker
to
sample
some
obscure
flavors
in
a
beer
very
interesting
and
complex

smoothing
out
in

hides
abv
well
d
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
here
blown
away
in
a
new
way
who
knew
thyme
sage
rosemary
and
whatnot
had
a
place
in
beer
this
is
very
complex
and
there
is
a
lot
going
on
its
hard
to
pick
up
on
all
of
it
at
once
it
does
somehow
remain
quite
balanced
this
is
an
exciting
beer
to
drink
due
to
its
pure
uniqueness
dont
know
that
i
could
have
more
than
one
every
once
in
a
great
while
but
this
is
one
crazy
concoction
of
a
beer
somehow
it
just
works
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
saison
the
use
of
rosemary
parsley
sage
and
thyme
all
at
once
was
too
much
at
once
and
i
was
unable
to
distinguish
each
flavor
it
left
a
horrible
listerine
after
taste
after
drinking
d
not
what
i
expected
at
all
better
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
so
complex
but
incredibly
refreshing
i
just
hope
i
can
hunt
down
another
bottle
this
is
the
first
beer
to
really
excite
me
in
a
while
purchased
at
tacoma
boys
appearance
is
a
hazy
cloudy
gold
white
head
that
did
not
sustain
very
well
aromatics
are
sweet
and
herby
with
hints
of
rosemary
and
sage
flavors
are
also
herby
and
slightly
medicinal
savory
with
a
sort
of
savory
vegetable
aftertaste
body
is
very
smooth
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
crispness
overall
this
is
good
different
and
quite
herby
for
a
saison
but
i
appreciate
the
unique
qualities
a
turgid
golden
amber
that
gives
a
nice
head
and
has
good
retention
lacing
is
quite
nice
and
the
beer
remains
covered
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
pale
malt
body
and
light
notes
of
the
herbs
used
not
as
big
as
the
stone
version
a
whisper
of
alcohol
and
not
much
funk
taste
is
sugar
biscuit
malty
with
the
herb
blend
and
hops
melding
into
a
lovely
complex
counter
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
there
is
a
white
grape
fruitiness
that
is
great
an
alcohol
edge
flows
into
the
hops
and
herbs
with
a
touch
of
mint
finish
is
mild
and
dry
with
an
herbal
flavor
that
leave
the
blend
lightly
lingering
feel
is
velvety
smooth
with
a
lightly
creamy
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
just
light
enough
to
quaff
a
little
too
fast
a
nice
one
and
while
similar
to
the
stone
version
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
touch
more
subtle
in
its
herbs
and
maybe
a
touch
more
alcoholic
this
poured
out
as
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
very
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
herbal
the
aromas
that
come
off
of
it
the
most
of
probably
the
sage
thyme
and
rosemary
the
taste
has
the
same
herbal
elements
that
the
smell
does
but
it
doesnt
last
as
long
the
flavors
kind
of
die
off
in
this
one
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
brew
i
feel
the
victory
version
was
a
lot
more
flavorful
i
would
like
to
get
the
stone
version
to
try
that
sometime
regardless
its
a
decent
beer
and
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
pretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
the
bottle
an
herbforward
saison
i
wish
it
had
some
of
the
funk
that
i
like
to
find
in
beers
of
this
style
but
its
still
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
nonetheless
o
spicy
and
tangy
beer
weird
not
bad
at
all
though
reviewed
from
notes
this
is
glorious
a
beautiful
blend
of
spices
bright
floral
crisp
light
coloured
with
some
retained
head
and
leaving
a
lace
trail
aroma
is
very
good
the
sage
leads
the
nose
and
there
is
white
pepper
and
a
blend
of
other
spices
and
nices
medium
mouthfeel
its
a
palate
tingler
but
it
goes
down
well
leading
to
good
drinkability
a
new
age
saison
i
may
have
liked
this
version
the
best
o
pretty
tasty
beer
but
probably
not
the
style
id
look
for
in
the
future
it
was
good
for
a
change
in
pace
from
the
usual
but
not
all
that
memorable
for
me
stylewise
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
savory
nose
and
flavor
follows
sweet
and
savory
not
a
fan
of
saisons
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
3
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
o
this
is
a
unique
experience
the
closest
i
can
compare
it
to
is
rosee
dhibiscus
i
would
call
it
more
of
a
herb
beer
since
that
is
the
dominant
flavor
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
dirty
beige
color
ale
with
a
good
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
spices
including
spices
with
solid
rustic
malt
backbone
and
some
nice
fruity
floral
ester
taste
is
a
great
complex
mix
between
some
rustic
malt
with
some
great
notes
of
sage
with
nice
floral
undertones
thyme
and
parsley
are
harder
to
detect
then
the
other
ingredient
body
is
full
with
good
carbonation
solid
offering
that
i
would
love
to
have
regular
access
to
perhaps
this
just
reminds
me
of
mama
mia
pizza
beer
interesting
concept
and
i
cant
remember
why
i
recognize
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
in
that
sequence
song
lyrics
o
interesting
to
try
pretty
good
even
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unfortunately
i
havent
been
able
to
find
the
other
two
but
ill
keep
looking
one
of
the
trio
of
saison
du
buffs
brewed
this
one
ranks
in
the
middle
for
me
but
still
an
excellent
brew
pour
is
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
cloudiness
to
it
good
head
and
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
is
of
spices
and
other
citrus
fruits
taste
is
heavy
spice
a
good
saison
and
the
strongest
of
the
3
in
the
spice
category
hops
are
very
floral
specific
malt
is
harder
to
detect
excellent
brew
o
i
am
a
sucker
for
herbs
the
smell
is
just
awesome
it
makes
me
think
of
pizza
and
sunday
gravy
etc
but
alone
the
flavors
are
strong
and
a
bit
too
much
this
is
a
great
food
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
chalice
at
cool
temp
goldenpale
amber
very
little
head
a
few
bubbles
lazily
drifting
up
fairly
clear
the
nose
is
vegetal
and
floral
and
quite
pronounced
the
flavor
shows
typical
saison
notes
a
little
bit
of
sulphur
grainy
malt
and
a
leafy
haylike
quality
the
finish
is
quite
dry
there
is
more
carbonation
prickliness
than
seems
likely
from
the
pour
lightbodied
despite
a
reasonably
high
alcohol
content
a
very
interesting
experimental
beer
of
the
garden
saison
type
id
drink
it
again
but
one
at
a
sitting
seems
about
right
interesting
even
with
the
blatant
rosemary
it
gave
me
the
impression
of
being
like
a
cucumber
herbalmedicinal
aftertaste
even
though
i
like
this
for
its
unique
flavor
im
not
sure
it
would
be
in
regular
rotation
for
me
if
it
were
available
in
my
state
but
i
would
try
it
again
as
its
a
solid
collaboration
brew
in
a
way
it
made
me
think
of
the
cucumber
saison
by
cigar
city
and
thats
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworangegold
with
a
light
soap
bubble
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
little
clouds
of
lacing
on
the
sides
this
is
another
dehydrated
pisslooking
beer
and
it
has
some
lovely
carbonation
seen
through
its
murky
interior
the
beer
smells
richly
biscuity
with
some
lovely
subtle
spice
notes
which
must
surely
be
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
the
spices
give
the
nose
a
slightly
minty
cool
feel
and
there
is
some
wet
citrus
floating
at
the
edges
of
the
smell
which
suggest
oranges
and
lemon
the
beer
tastes
surprisingly
bananay
with
the
esters
and
biscuity
with
strong
citrus
undertones
the
spice
is
much
softer
in
the
taste
leaving
a
hint
of
mint
in
the
aftertaste
mixing
with
the
bread
and
banana
esters
to
suggest
a
wheat
malt
backing
mouthfeel
is
superbly
clean
and
refreshing
making
this
an
excellent
summer
beer
the
mouth
is
only
barely
kissed
with
saliva
after
the
beer
passes
and
is
ringing
with
a
slight
spicy
burn
that
helps
to
beg
for
more
beer
carbonation
is
bubbly
and
frothy
in
the
mouth
which
helps
the
flavoring
feel
fresh
in
quick
and
the
mouth
and
probably
washes
away
some
of
the
more
brutal
bite
from
the
spices
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
spicy
wit
than
a
saison
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
overall
it
is
a
fantastic
summer
sipper
and
a
lovely
collaboration
by
dogfish
head
stone
and
victory
if
i
can
find
the
other
two
i
will
definitely
try
them
but
id
say
dogfish
head
has
done
this
beer
well
to
their
companys
name
it
is
a
quirky
saison
that
is
more
of
a
wit
and
definitely
worth
a
sip
o
two
words
almost
perfect
this
is
a
great
saisonfarmhouse
not
anything
more
needs
to
be
said
this
made
it
into
my
top
5
collab
beers
and
i
still
have
two
other
versions
to
try
still
stone
victory
you
cant
be
disappointed
with
this
ale
overall
not
something
id
reach
for
very
often
but
an
interesting
tasting
beer
lots
of
herbalspicy
notes
going
on
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
quality
beer
worth
a
try
or
a
6pack
if
youre
bored
a
nice
saison
in
the
uppermiddle
tier
of
those
that
ive
had
very
herby
and
especially
sagey
which
isnt
surprising
given
the
additions
but
it
has
the
soul
of
a
saison
overall
paid
3
for
this
bottle
very
interesting
beer
with
unique
tastes
wonder
how
different
the
other
versions
are
overall
very
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
o
very
interesting
and
i
think
you
should
taste
this
but
i
couldnt
drink
many
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
brew
very
refreshing
and
hoppy
o
although
the
flavors
are
decently
balanced
ive
found
when
cooking
that
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
isnt
the
best
combination
and
the
same
hold
true
here
the
just
dont
get
along
that
well
the
saison
character
is
a
bit
muted
which
is
to
be
expected
with
the
herbs
taking
center
stage
overall
sdb
is
easily
the
best
of
stones
collaboration
beers
ive
bought
a
few
bottles
and
ill
surely
buy
a
few
more
nice
job
o
this
is
a
very
unique
saison
and
was
well
worth
the
price
i
will
have
to
try
the
victory
and
stone
versions
of
these
very
good
collaboration
by
three
top
quality
brewers
when
poured
it
has
a
hazy
golden
color
body
with
a
2head
that
lays
down
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
like
straight
out
of
a
herb
garden
rosemary
and
sage
dominate
then
the
tyhme
and
parsley
come
after
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
spicy
but
just
like
the
smell
rosemary
and
sage
dominate
the
taste
also
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
goes
down
nice
and
easy
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
very
light
it
partially
coats
the
mouth
but
isnt
too
sticky
enjoyable
feel
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
o
a
very
enjoyable
spicy
saison
drinkabilty
is
high
flavor
has
a
nice
richness
this
is
a
beer
that
would
pair
extremely
well
with
chicken
and
other
meat
dishes
cheers
tastespicy
herbal
lemongrass
nice
little

seem
to

nothing
overdone
a

for

great
drinkability
this
a
darn
tasty
saison
and
it
would
be
easy
to
put
back
a
couple
this
is
a
great
collaboration
between
three
of
my
favorite
breweries
mouthfeel
and
overall
light
bodied
and
unique
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
dogfish
head
a
nice
collaberation
between
stone
victory
and
dfh
a
bit
of
a
skunky
aftertaste
in
the
end
o
a
good
saison
compared
to
victorys
offering
of
the
beer
which
i
tried
in
early
2011
this
seems
much
less
herbal
with
grassiness
in
its
place
it
almost
seems
like
a
yeasted
up
pilsener
at
times
worth
a
try
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
half
glass
that
i
had
i
cant
believe
how
good
these
herbs
taste
in
a
beer
very
surprisingly
delicious
need
to
drink
more
saisons
i
was
craving
a
saison
all
day
at
work
yesterday
so
when
i
looked
in
the
beer
fridge
last
night
this
one
fit
the
bill
this
one
came
highly
recommended
by
2
reputable
sources
so
i
was
looking
foward
to
it
poured
into
a
snifter
a
hazy
golden
brew
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
has
the
typical
spicey
saison
smell
ad
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
a
tad
citrus
the
flavor
starts
out
alot
like
a
typical
delicious
saison
too
but
those
subtle
herbs
swirling
around
throughout
work
really
nicely
herbal
flowery
notes
with
the
sweetness
and
the
bit
of
spiciness
this
is
nice
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
and
could
see
myself
possibly
having
a
couple
more
before
this
summer
ends
poured
into
a
dfh
glass
a
nice
cloudy
golden
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
onefinger
thick
creamyfizzy
white
head
which
does
leave
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
alot
of
yeast
notes
very
nice
touch
of
spice
also
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
malty
yeasty
with
some
rosemary
thyme
and
sage
very
upfront
medium
body
a
very
nice
brew
to
have
on
a
hot
day
overall
nice
use
of
herbs
in
this
one
it
all
got
along
well
together
tastes
much
better
than
i
would
have
thought
from
the
ingredients
list
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
though
not
one
id
have
regularly
o
if
you
gave
this
to
me
in
december
id
swear
it
was
a
holiday
beer
the
herbs
are
unique
but
a
bit
overpowering
overall
but
keep
coming
back
to
thinking
that
it
tastes
like
a
lot
of
holiday
beers
ive
had
mostly
schlaflys
christmas
ale
but
with
a
lighter
body
and
less
alcohol
the
thyme
notes
are
reminiscent
of
dc
braus
thyme
after
thyme
a
unique
session
beer
but
will
space
my
tastings
out
mt
amazing
spices
all
on
their
ownparsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
harmonize
to
just
the
right
tone
of
herbal
flavor
with
a
seamless
blend
to
deliver
lemon
accented
spice
and
flavor
carbonation
and
milder
crisp
malt
lend
generously
to
the
spices
and
citrus
at
work
offcentered
from
the
classic
saison
no
doubt
but
delicious
thankfully
my
bro
was
nice
enough
to
part
with
one
of
these
im
surely
not
disappointed
in
the
least
with
this
i
look
forward
to
other
collaborative
efforts
between
dfh
victory
and
stone
this
is
not
one
to
pass
up
very
good
take
on
the
style
highly
sessionable
brew
the
aroma
is
herbal
with
all
the
expected
qualities
plus
hay
like
hops
and
malt
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
nice
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
cooked
veggies
the
palate
is
average
overall
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
like
and
would
drink
again
a
great
collaboration
brew
here
from
three
of
the
best
breweries
i
loved
this
one
a
big
time
session
brew
that
has
lots
going
on
in
terms
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
great
stuff
o
unique
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
want
a
whole
lot
of
this
but
it
does
push
the
envelope
of
what
beer
can
be
the
6
8
abv
is
not
over
the
top
but
the
strong
flavors
rule
it
out
as
a
sessionable
beer
its
more
a
one
and
done
beer
overall
perfect
degree
of
sweetness
varies
from
yeasty
and
stronger
herbal
presence
of
other
of
this
style
very
drinkable
nice
but
certainly
not
up
to
the
standard
of
a
classic
saison
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
what
i
expected
and
another
beer
im
glad
i
tried
but
i
would
not
try
again
unless
it
was
a
food
pairing
designed
to
compliment
this
beer
each
sip
had
sensory
distortion
as
the
aroma
coming
up
through
my
tulip
glass
just
blasted
me
with
herbs
and
kept
the
overall
experience
out
of
synch
gotta
support
the
cause
and
the
craft
beer
movement
but
these
misses
are
like
collateral
damage
in
the
war
to
keep
the
beer
machine
flowing
one
and
done
on
this
collaboration
md
smooth
and
sharp
all
at
once
great
flavor
amalgam
spices
are
not
for
the
uninitiated
o
as
with
a
number
of
dogfish
beers
its
interesting
but
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
in
a
pickasix
instead
of
a
whole
fourpack
i
dont
really
want
another
with
that
said
this
might
pair
nicely
with
thanksgiving
dinner
i
think
it
would
complement
turkey
and
dressing
though
im
not
sure
i
want
it
to
pair
quite
as
directly
as
it
would
definitely
unique
but
with
an
odd
attraction
to
it
enjoyable
but
only
in
limited
doses
oreally
interesting
beer
went
into
it
a
little
skeptical
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
complex
originally
reviewed
10292010
this
beer
alone
tastes
different
then
when
you
are
eating
it
tastes
so
much
beeter
when
you
are
eating
it
has
parsley
sage
rosemary
thyme
what
a
fantastic
mea
or
summer
beer
i
really
love
this
beer
and
usually
prefer
hoppy

a

the
first
time
i
had
it
was
churchky
so
i
knew
it
would
be
a
great
pairing
for
my
luncch
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
typical
dogfish
quality
d
better
than
i
ever
would
have
guessed
it
is
worth
trying
i
would
assume
the
other
two
breweries
versions
are
roughly
identical
i
certainly
would
drink
it
everyday
but
it
is
refreshing
in
the
heat
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
like
to
try
the
other
two
to
see
if
the
different
breweries
have
different
flavors
even
though
it
says
they
have
the
same
recipe
o
very
satisfied
i
cant
wait
to
have
again
not
my
usual
favorite
type
of
beer
but
du
buff
will
definitely
be
added
to
favorite
list
the
lemon
and
spices
work
amazingly
in
this
beer
without
being
to
over
powering
highly
recommend
o
like
the
other
du
buffs
quite
good
and
tasty
they
all
have
their
own
uniqueness
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
the
last
of
them
pours
light
yellow
and
carries
an
etched
surface
of
white
foam
and
residual
spots
of
lace
remain
slightly
yeasty
coriander
thyme
and
rosemary
dominate
this
one
for
me
flavor
is
substantially
more
belgian
yeast
and
herbal
character
a
bit
of
a
nutty
hint
from
the
yeast
the
herbs
are
primarily
parsley
and
thyme
with
burnt
sage
and
some
bitterness
in
the
midpoint
thin
bodied
with
subdued
carb
and
semi
dry
finish
decent
beer
c
im
excited
about
this
one
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
dark
golden
yellow
with
2
fingers
of
white
head
that
slowly
shrinks
to
a
pinky
nice
lacing
aroma
is
total
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
light
bread
qualities
are
there
but
tough
to
find
i
feel
that
if
i
was
drinking
this
any
colder
than
45
degrees
id
miss
it
taste
is
the
same
herbs
mentioned
there
is
also
a
grassy
citrus
quality
and
the
belgian
yeast
is
there
too
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
different
and
really
good
i
imagine
it
would
be
perfect
with
lamb
chops
i
had
this
one
in
a
pint
glass
poured
with
a
thick
34
of
head
the
color
was
a
really
nice
murky
yellow
i
knew
this
wasnt
the
saison
i
was
looking
for
when
i
took
a
whiff
instead
of
the
spicy
fruity
tones
of
a
saison
i
got
hops
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
dfh
does
hops
i
was
intrigued
to
see
them
produce
a
style
that
traditionally
leans
more
on
spice
for
flavor
but
with
dfh
and
stone
on
the
label
it
had
to
be
hops
in
the
bottle
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
isnt
a
good
saison
o
i
havent
had
many
saisons
but
i
think
this
is
one
i
could
go
to
as
far
as
saisons
this
may
be
not
something
i
could
drink
all
of
the
time
but
actually
be
my
goto
saison
if
needed
o
i
think
i
liked
the
idea
more
than
the
execution
for
this
beer
the
spices
seemed
to
overshadow
the
delicate
flavors
of
the
saison
beneath
overall
having
been
so
disappointed
with
the
stone
version
a
few
years
ago
i
was
delighted
with
the
brew
that
dogfish
has
put
together
here
the
spices
blend
together
nicely
rather
than
dominate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
just
perfect
for
these
warming
days
o
i
remember
the
herbs
coming
through
a
lot
more
in
the
first
batch
but
still
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
o
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
and
really
stands
out
as
a
taste
in
a
saison
that
i
have
yet
to
see
often
times
i
find
them
incredibly
peppery
and
have
yet
to
find
the
more
herbal
spices
i
saw
in
this
one
not
my
favorite
americanmade
saison
but
a
solid
experiment
second
year
in
a
row
that
ive
tasted
dogfish
heads
version
without
ever
giving
the
other
two
a
try
ill
keep
looking

lightmedium
slight
warmth
of

overall
i
went
into
this
one
thinking
it
would
be
too
spicy
bitter
i
know
most
breweries
like
to
add
extra
hops
to
styles
or
even
tart
and
lemony
but
this
beer
is
crafted
really
perfectly
a
must
have
for
any
fan
of
the
style
or
one
off
beers
of
dogfish
overall
its
a
very
unique
saison
i
enjoy
it
and
would
drink
again
in
a
second
having
the
victory
next
to
this
which
is
slightly
milder
in
taste
a
tad
stronger
in
smell
and
has
a
clear
body
with
less
head
overall
an
enjoyable
departure
from
the
norm
well
crafted
perhaps
a
tad
out
of
balance
on
the
hop
side
but
lots
of
interesting
flavors
going
on
here
not
sure
if
its
an
every
day
beer
but
surely
is
a
very
nice
visit
to
once
in
a
while
to
keep
things
interesting
over
all
a
very
nice
saison
wouldnt
mind
trying
the
other
two
iterations
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
with
a
large
lasting
white
head
aroma
of
parsley
sage
rosemary
with
some
fruity
citrus
notes
and
some
light
malt
as
it
warms
up
taste
is
same
as
aroma
with
a
bit
of
malt
grains
and
slight
hops
bitterness
palate
is
a
light
to
med
body
soft
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
mouth
feel
finish
is
dominated
by
parsley
rosemary
sage
flavor
some
fruity
citrus
notes
with
some
hops
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
and
a
lingering
nutty
parsley
flavor
overall
a
good
crisp
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
i
also
agree
with
the
review
directly
below
in
that
the
only
real
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
price
tag
at
roughly
52
for
a
case
its
not
the
cheapest
of
craft
beers
but
i
certainly
like
it
and
look
forward
to
brewing
a
homebrew
version
with
the
recipe
straight
out
of
stones
book
cheers
moreys
bottom
line
i
found
this
beer
really
refreshing
back
in
2010
while
bbqing
by
the
pool
at
our
resort
its
unseasonably
warm
today
and
its
like
deja
vu
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
you
would
never
guess
that
its
6
8
the
only
thing
that
will
keep
me
from
drinking
this
all
summer
long
is
the
price
at
3
99
per
12oz
bottle
its
just
not
within
my
budget
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelf
i
highly
recommend
grabbing
a
6
pack
or
at
least
a
couple
of
bottles
o
i
can
only
imagine
that
there
must
be
an
awesome
food
pairing
here
thanksgiving
maybe
unfortunately
though
i
just
dont
find
these
particular
spices
to
be
that
appetizing
in
a
beer
i
dont
see
enough
of
the
saison
character
here
eitherits
mostly
overwhelmed
some
lemon
or
citrus
would
go
a
long
way
in
balancing
the
spice
i
had
soured
a
bit
on
dfh
after
trying
a
couple
of
subpar
offerings
recently
in
particular
the
pj
20
ale
which
tasted
slightly
better
than
budweiser
theyve
redeemed
themselves
with
this
one
a
very
unique
saison
that
i
would
have
more
of
it
it
wasnt
so
expensive
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute

pours
a
light
orange
straw
color
thin
fine
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
bready

sage
and
other
european
herbs
nice
intriguing
aroma
flavor
follows
with
a
nice
laid
back
bready
malt
and
complex
herbs
i
can
pick
out
sage
but
the
herbal
component
is
well
blended
and
nothing
really
dominates
the
herbal
level
seems
perfect
for
the
malt
backbone
to
support
thought
i
detected
a
hint
of
funk
in
the
finish
but
it
may
be
the
herbs
a
very
nice
medium
to
heavy
body
with
creaminess
i
thought
this
was
very
nicely
balanced
and
has
an
interesting
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fine
light
body
moderate
carbonation
a
little
prickly
crisp
pretty
refreshing
maybe
a
little
better
than
the
victory
because
of
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
but
might
not
taste
as
good
hard
to
say
overall
this
beer
is
a
tad
bit
pricey
clocking
in
at
4
a
12oz
bottle
but
is
a
relatively
good
bargain
considering
its
novelty
within
the
beer
world
overall
what
an
amazing
beer
i
love
saisons
anyway
but
the
little
bit
extra
in
this
just
puts
it
over
the
top
i
picked
this
up
on
a
trip
to
ohio
and
wish
i
would
have
grabbed
several
more
bottles
o
very
impressed
with
this
if
you
enjoy
good
food
cooking
with
lots
of
herbs
and
the
like
you
should
def
try
this
beer
again
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
very
unique
enjoyable
complex
aside
actually
as
i
drink
more
the
taste
has
seemed
to
morph
from
all
bitter
at
the
end
to
bitter
finishing
with
malty
sweetness
very
interesting
and
very
nice
oscarborough
fair
is
a
better
song
and
the
graduate
is
a
better
movie
the
beer
is
decent
but
and
the
end
of
the
day
the
meshing
of
flavors
is
slightly
off
o
i
had
the
victory
version
last
year
and
was
very
impressed
this
one
came
up
a
bit
short
with
too
much
emphasis
on
sweetness
and
not
enough
on
the
belgian
yeasts
that
define
the
style
there
is
almost
no
funky
brett
to
be
had
here
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
o
interesting
take
on
a
saison
easily
the
most
italian
beer
ive
ever
had
o
not
bad
it
would
be
a
good
food
beer
seems
tailormade
to
go
with
herb
encrusted
chicken
not
the
best
collaborative
effort
of
these
brewers
i
thought
sure
a
simon
and
garfunkel
beer
made
of
course
with
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
but
this
one
is
off
pours
a
clear
golden
color
too
clear
for
a
saison
right
small
white
head
smells
is
not
nearly
as
herbaceous
as
i
thought
it
might
be
with
only
really
the
rosemary
appearing
aromatically
all
yeast
in
the
nose
flavor
the
only
herb
i
can
taste
is
the
sage
and
its
kind
of
funky
in
here
combined
with
the
others
and
this
unpleasant
yeast
i
dont
care
for
this
much
feel
is
okay
lighter
but
too
lightly
carbonated
i
appreciate
the
attempt
to
do
something
new
but
this
isnt
very
good
at
all
overall
a
nice
spin
on
a
farmhouse
ale
the
spices
added
really
make
this
one
special
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
d
not
bad
one
of
the
better
collabs
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
i
would
revisit
this
one
without
a
second
thought
when
i
had
the
stone
version
it
was
my
first
saison
and
one
of
the
first
50
reviews
i
had
done
it
is
cool
to
see
how
my
reviews
have
evolved
in
almost
two
years
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
offering
from
dfh
and
im
not
surprised
about
that
a
couple
of
years
back
dfh
was
routinely
putting
out
high
quality
tasty
and
innovative
brews
but
its
almost
like
they
are
trying
too
hard
nowadays
this
one
feels
too
gimicky
w
the
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
and
it
fails
in
execution
im
not
even
sure
this
should
be
called
a
saison
im
glad
i
tasted
it
but
also
glad
i
only
purchased
one
and
will
not
be
buying
more
in
the
future
overall
if
you
like
herbal
and
floral
flavors
this
beer
will
be
for
you
it
is
all
right
not
very
saison
like
not
funky
at
all
more
like
a
golden
ale
with
a
lot
of
spices
its
okay
pours
a
faded
gold
color
and
initially
has
a
high
effervescent
head
as
well
which
recedes
to
about
14
in
still
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
aroma
picking
up
a
sharp
herbal
character
from
the
thymerosemarysageparsley
that
was
added
has
a
bit
of
a
smoked
beer
hint
to
it
as
well
i
also
notice
the
farmhouse
yeast
in
there
flavor
as
others
have
said
just
what
the
description
says
imagine
a
belgian
pale
with
added
herbs
and
a
bit
of
farmhouse
funk
not
too
much
of
the
latter
though
the
mouthfeelbody
is
typical
for
a
saison
overall
i
did
not
expect
much
out
of
this
as
i
tend
not
to
care
for
the
really
out
there
beer
ingredients
but
in
this
case
it
is
very
interesting
that
all
of
the
elements
in
this
mesh
nicely
good
to
drink
by
itself
and
i
bet
this
would
pair
well
with
mild
hors
doeuvres
when
entertaining
now
im
curious
about
what
the
victory
and
stone
versions
are
like
if
you
have
ever
wanted
a
beer
that
smells
like
a
fancy
country
store
soap
or
wondered
what
would
happen
if
simon
and
garfunkel
started
brewing
you
have
found
your
beer
it
exemplifies
why
rosemary
sage
and
thyme
are
not
standard
ingredients
for
beer
at
3
99
per
12oz
bottle
make
sure
you
buy
just
one
i
found
it
interesting
and
unique
but
had
no
desire
for
another
one
though
it
did
leave
me
feeling
clean
overall
this
was
a
nice
saison
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tried
and
i
love
the
creativity
of
adding
all
of
these
spices
that
i
love
and
use
everyday
into
this
beer
highly
recommended
o
a
very
interesting
combination
of
the
spices
with
a
saison
but
not
especially
easy
to
drink
or
refreshing
i
dont
think
i
would
be
likely
to
purchase
this
one
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
low
profile
bubbly
light
head
that
is
bright
white
aromas
of
spearmint
cedar
and
pepper
on
a
roasted
grain
backbone
flavors
are
cedar
and
pine
initially
like
a
moutful
of
evergreen
with
a
brightly
sweet
spearmint
kick
at
the
tail
end
of
the
palate
spices
abound
the
more
you
drink
with
a
strong
rosemary
and
thyme
character
dominating
very
green
on
the
palate
if
you
will
like
knocking
a
spice
rack
into
the
brew
decnt
layered
lacing
along
the
glass
as
you
consume
the
aftertaste
has
a
touch
of
malty
tang
quickly
overwhelmed
by
the
spice
profile
once
again
with
a
quick
tangy
finish
spicing
lingers
but
also
cleans
the
palate
this
one
is
dynamic
and
actually
works
your
tastebuds
its
like
a
challenging
hike
for
your
palate
o
i
like
the
complexity
of
this
beer
lots
of
flavor
coming
everywhere
between
the
nose
and
taste
this
is
one
unique
brew
love
it
id
recommend
to
split
a
bottle
with
someone
if
you
see
this
but
dont
go
crazy
and
buy
a
bunch
good
experience
but
it
no
way
my
favorite
saison
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
amber
hues
with
a
three
finger
head
bright
white
head
and
heavy
lacing
great
retention
the
savory
smell
of
herbs
dominates
accented
by
yeast
grassy
hops
and
bread
are
upfront
followed
by
the
mildest
touch
of
malt
finishes
with
a
bouquet
of
herbs
wonderfully
carbonated
light
body
that
is
smooth
and
velvety
a
very
interesting
saison
that
i
liked
even
more
than
expected
looking
forward
to
trying
some
creative
food
pairings
with
my
remaining
bottles
o
saison
du
buff
is
a
wellcrafted
and
interesting
saison
its
very
herbal
which
is
unique
and
will
be
the
huge
determining
factor
of
your
enjoyment
i
love
the
smell
and
was
a
bit
cool
on
the
taste
i
may
not
have
been
crazy
about
it
but
we
each
have
our
own
tastes
and
as
i
said
it
is
clearly
wellconstructed
worth
a
try
if
you
like
herbs
andor
saisons
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
here
and
it
didnt
contribute
to
the
taste
at
all
i
could
only
feel
the
warming
effect
of
it
once
i
made
my
way
through
the
drink
and
the
flavors
were
able
to
stand
out
on
their
own
this
was
not
something
id
down
quickly
or
would
offer
to
a
novice
beer
drinker
but
i
can
honestly
say
that
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
the
finish
was
clean
to
this
and
the
spice
wasnt
too
much
to
take
kudos
for
pushing
the
edge
of
what
a
spicy
beer
can
be
this
is
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
any
of
the
three
brewers
involved
in
this
collaboration
brewed
with
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
pours
a
clear
lighter
amber
one
finger
soapy
white
head
turns
into
a
thin
ring
and
splotchy
lace
in
a
minute
smell
lemon
slight
evergreen
but
also
muddy
and
weedy
parsleys
contribution
i
suppose
taste
the
sage
and
thyme
dominate
over
a
grainy
pale
malt
base
slightly
salty
with
some
lemon
medium
bodied
from
creamy
but
aggressive
carbonation
drying
out
some
at
the
end
of
the
sip
yeah
the
parsley
is
bringing
nothing
good
to
the
table
here
overall
the
herbs
are
a
little
over
the
top
but
was
worth
a
shot
bottled
2012
b
o
easy
to
drink
and
decent
all
around
i
didnt
get
the
yeast
presence
i
like
but
its
a
well
made
saison
at
3bottle
odnot
a
big
fan
of
this
the
spices
are
too
noticeable
at
least
this
was
not
too
pricey
at
under
3
for
a
small
bottle
wont
try
again
pours
a
clear
light
golden
orange
with
a
fair
amount
of
champagne
like
carbonation
that
gives
it
a
2
finger
head
that
steadies
to
a
tight
bubbled
lace
around
the
top
brewed
with
rosemary
and
thyme
wow
no
shit
rosemary
kick
right
in
the
face
rosemary
mixed
with
lemon
semi
sour
grassy
scent
from
the
thyme
id
assume
very
bready
and
full
of
flavor
odd
flavors
however
rosemary
lemon
pepper
nice
familiar
saison
flavors
mixed
with
overwhelming
helpings
of
spice
clove
grass
pine
needles
and
a
big
funk
on
the
finish
light
in
body
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
sparkly
and
fizzy
bold
and
spicy
and
finishes
bitter
overall
def
not
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
but
absolutely
the
strangest
odd
mixture
of
flavors
that
absolutely
work
in
every
way
the
spice
is
really
heavy
on
this
one
but
well
worth
a
try
cheers
poured
from
bottle
to
duvel
tulip
the
beer
arrives
a
orange
golden
color
with
a
decent
1
finger
white
head
some
retention
and
good
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
full
of
the
spice
predominantly
rosemary
that
the
beer
is
brewed
with
hints
of
pepper
and
thyme
and
a
bit
of
apple
fruitiness
together
with
the
saison
yeast
the
beer
starts
with
a
prominent
wheat
base
from
which
the
fruity
character
found
in
the
nose
builds
lemon
and
orange
the
spices
then
enter
and
dominate
the
taste
with
again
a
large
rosemary
and
thyme
character
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
but
not
too
bad
earthy
pine
hop
character
provides
a
medium
bitterness
finishes
with
a
lingering
rosemary
wheat
flavor
on
the
tongue
crisp
and
clean
well
carbonated
and
ligher
bodied
overall
not
a
bad
beer
though
i
would
prefer
the
herbs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
more
poured
the
rerelease
of
this
beauty
into
a
tulip
glass
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
and
great
lacing
very
bready
smell
aromas
of
flowers
honey
rosemary
definitely
and
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
bitter
up
front
with
a
tang
that
releases
the
rosemary
and
thyme
flavors
cascade
hops
some
lemon
peel
flavor
this
is
slightly
more
bitter
than
i
remember
it
being
back
in
2010
but
is
still
a
great
beer
its
a
cross
from
light
to
medium
body
very
fizzy
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
very
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
a
great
beer
cant
wait
to
try
my
favorite
version
stone
one
bottle
is
enough
you
are
duly
amazed
and
prepared
for
a
subsequent
feast
of
roast
pork
belly
with
perhaps
a
tripel
to
go
with
it
i
love
a
beer
that
tastes
like
when
it
says
it
should
taste
like
i
was
afraid
that
the
herbs
would
be
overpowering
but
the
beer
was
nice
and
light
yet
full
and
tasted
every
bit
like
the
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
brewed
into
this
glorious
beer
a
golden
orange
with
a
decent
white
head
that
quickly
becomes
a
small
white
head
and
then
gravitates
to
the
edges
decent
retention
a
very
herby
aroma
totally
unique
to
me
to
be
coming
from
a
beer
with
a
sweetness
to
it
that
aroma
is
right
there
in
the
flavor
too
a
nice
malt
base
to
this
and
the
herbs
kick
in
mid
stream
very
up
front
gmedium
bodied
to
this
not
much
carbonation
at
all
i
enjoyed
my
first
few
sips
but
the
more
of
it
i
drank
the
more
i
found
the
flavor
to
start
to
become
too
much
and
i
barely
could
finish
the
bottle
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
could
actually
go
for
a
more
intense
herbal
flavor
maybe
matching
the
nose
its
balanced
though
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
would
have
it
again
at
first
i
was
a
little
taken
back
by
the
big
aromas
of
herbs
and
spices
but
as
this
warms
some
hops
come
out
and
play
off
the
herbs
very
nicely
sometimes
its
almost
unclear
whether
its
the
hops
or
the
herbs
your
tasting
well
done
id
love
to
session
this
all
day
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
appearance
and
aroma
of
this
beer
both
were
very
nice
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
while
it
is
in
the
mouth
is
quite
nice
but
the
aftertaste
really
takes
away
from
the
overall
greatness
of
the
beer
it
has
interesting
ingredients
and
good
qualities
with
the
exception
of
the
aftertaste
and
is
worth
a
try
what
comes
in
later
is
a
welcome
surprise
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
those
spices
come
in
very
late
and
really
felt
upon
exhale
feels
slick
not
real
sure
i
like
that
part
of
the
beer
o
a
unique
and
delicious
collaboration
almost
like
a
citrus
tea
in
flavor
great
balance
overall
4
0
very
welldone
in
my
opinion
whats
most
remarkable
about
this
brew
is
that
its
just
so
well
balanced
more
than
anything
else
the
malt
the
yeast
the
spicesthey
all
get
their
time
to
shine
even
if
the
parsley
sage
rosemary
thyme
take
center
stage
this
would
be
a
superb
accompaniment
to
the
right
dish
too
havent
tried
the
stone
or
victory
versions
of
this
beer
but
id
be
curious
to
test
them
out
sidebyside
this
one
is
a
keeper
though
would
definitely
buy
it
again
o
i
cant
trust
my
memory
perhaps
this
surpassed
the
victory
version
maybe
not
i
dont
care
this
is
damn
delicious
the
herbs
have
a
subtle
presence
but
it
never
comes
off
as
a
herbed
or
flavored
beer
its
very
well
integrated
into
the
earthy
flavors
of
the
saison
im
glad
they
rebrewed
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
collaboration
beers
o
this
was
a
pretty
decent
saison
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
above
average
a
little
bit
tangierfruitier
then
your
average
saison
nice
appealing
smell
and
an
easy
to
drink
taste
recommended
to
try
but
probably
wont
buy
again
since
they
only
sell
in
single
bottles
at
my
local
liquor
store
interesting
its
quite
a
delicate
flavor
across
the
board
despite
having
a
hearty
saison
core
some
staple
flavors
are
there
lemon
core
belgian
yeasts
a
very
slight
touch
of
funk
the
interesting
parts
come
from
the
herbs
theyre
all
present
if
you
want
to
focus
on
it
but
work
better
together
for
a
nice
fresh
herbal
undertone
that
provides
a
refreshing
crispness
and
a
unique
take
on
the
saison
rosemary
and
thyme
linger
a
bit
later
but
thats
okay
tad
too
much
drying
until
youve
been
drinking
it
a
bit
but
not
bad
pleasant
beer
i
would
eat
this
with
some
roasted
chicken
and
root
veggies
hell
yes
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
picking
up
a
few
bottles
if
i
spot
it
in
the
area
o
quite
a
letdown
from
my
perspective
as
these
are
3
of
my
favorite
breweries
collaborating
and
this
is
what
they
came
up
with
just
proof
of
how
when
ideas
sound
good
on
paper
they
dont
always
come
out
well
when
executed
the
alcohol
level
pushes
beyond
any
sessionable
experience
but
that
is
expected
from
this
collaboration
warmth
is
okay
but
not
adding
to
an
otherwise
enjoyable
experience
d
drinkability
dfh
saison
du
buff
is
a
good
beer
that
could
be
greatly
improved
with
a
more
solid
mouthfeel
in
any
case
drinkability
suffers
as
it
did
in
all
three
versions
from
the
herbs
that
were
used
while
they
add
depth
and
complexity
they
are
not
suited
for
long
term
enjoyment
dont
know
if
theres
another
beer
quite
like
this
one
out
there
its
not
anything
id
get
a
regular
craving
for
but
its
certainly
different
and
worth
a
try
this
is
a
bit
of
an
oddball
beer
but
its
enjoyable
if
you
like
the
herbs
dfh
used
good
carbonation
gives
the
thin
body
a
bit
of
life
booze
unnoticed
went
well
with
an
assorted
cheese
and
crackers
platter
o
odd
and
not
really
enjoyable
i
like
it
its
a
good
beer
different
and
tastey
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
it
was
4
00
at
deciccos
pelham
thats
a
24
6pack
good
but
not
that
good
but
please
keep
the
collaborations
coming
that
does
make
this
brew
worth
the
4
onetime
price
o
pretty
nice
refreshing
beer
i
think
i
have
had
the
victory
version
and
should
try
the
stone
next
and
see
how
they
compare
sam
and
co
have
done
it
again
well
done
dogfish
not
being
a
big
saison
fan
i
went
in
with
low
expectations
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
while
the
herbs
add
a
pleasant
aroma
they
were
subtle
and
delicious
in
the
background
of
this
mild
yet
flavorful
brew
very
fulfilling
mouthfeel
with
just
just
enough
hops
to
keep
me
interested
i
was
surprised
to
finish
this
beer
wishing
i
had
another
creamy
full
bodied
and
crisp
also
astringent
and
heated
for
a
6
8
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
alcohol
floating
around
here
that
cant
find
a
home
for
itself
carbonation
isnt
overwhelming
but
very
noticeable
i
feel
like
it
hides
the
true
flavors
of
the
beer
which
for
what
i
can
detect
is
a
positive
aspect
well
done
on
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beverage
a
bit
drier
than
other
saison
du
buffs
but
it
does
present
more
sweet
background
to
play
with
i
feel
like
this
one
hits
it
stronger
on
the
head
for
a
saison
but
still
not
amazing
definitely
the
best
of
the
bunch
from
what
ive
had
o
honestly
this
was
a
lot
better
then
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
sense
of
a
traditional
saison
and
the
herbal
bouquet
adds
a
whole
new
level
very
interesting
brew
o
saisons
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
type
of
beers
this
is
a
well
done
version
made
between
three
great
breweries
it
has
a
lot
of
complex
smells
and
flavors
but
it
does
not
have
as
much
funk
as
the
belgium
saisons
the
flavors
range
honey
citrus
fruit
pepper
and
herbs
it
is
sweet
at
first
but
it
becomes
drier
towards
the
finish
from
notes
tasted
in
midaugust
2010
from
bottle
at
lush
roscoe
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
still
displays
good
retention
nose
is
belgian
yeast
with
some
candi
sugar
and
a
strong
herbal
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
and
very
strong
green
and
herbal
flavors
body
is
medium
with
active
carbonation
and
a
long
herbal
finish
complex
and
refreshing
in
a
great
way
with
herb
notes
and
that
guava
fruitiness
bursting
at
the
seams
saisons
can
be
hit
or
miss
depending
on
the
drinker
but
i
think
this
is
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
thanks
to
inlimbo77
for
this
good
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
stone
dogfish
head
and
victory
what
is
there
to
not
like
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
recommend
everyone
try
if
you
find
it
i
stumbled
across
it
at
the
local
store
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
nice
and
carbonated
with
a
huge
thick
fourfinger
white
head
as
a
result
of
an
aggressive
pour
herbal
sediment
noticeable
in
the
pour
and
in
the
bottle
ergo
the
beer
got
cloudier
as
i
poured
more
citrus
in
the
nose
earthy
and
herbal
with
the
rosemary
primarily
noticeable
powerful
flavor
earthy
grassy
lots
of
citrus
despite
the
amount
of
spice
used
it
doesnt
come
across
as
being
too
strong
in
the
spice
department
still
the
rosemary
probably
contributes
the
most
very
smooth
sweet
flavorful
but
light
lightmedium
mouthfeel
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
really
well
balanced
and
the
spices
are
very
well
incorporated
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
dry
feel
to
it
throughout
pours
golden
straw
in
color
with
big
fluffy
white
head
several
fingers
thick
almost
clear
but
a
bit
of
yeast
got
in
the
glass
herbal
aroma
with
some
yeasty
notes
very
pleasant
taste
is
all
over
the
place
strong
carbonation
up
front
dry
finish
and
a
mix
of
herbs
in
the
middle
not
very
pleasant
for
my
taste
and
i
think
drinkability
suffers
i
picked
this
up
for
the
oddness
factor
but
dont
see
me
looking
for
any
more
of
it
this
may
sound
weird
but
i
was
thinking
of
chicken
throughout
the
drink
all
the
spicing
might
lend
themselves
to
a
nice
beer
in
the
rear
recipe
or
something
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
line
with
the
style
but
not
anything
i
need
to
have
again
it
was
really
nice
on
this
summery
day
the
seasons
work
with
the
warm
weather
overall
if
i
didnt
have
to
smell
it
to
drink
it
it
would
be
better
i
wish
i
didnt
still
have
the
other
2
versions
in
my
fridge
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
want
to
taste
the
result
of
too
much
pointless
spicing
3
5
the
aroma
was
very
very
nice
rich
notes
of
spices
apricot
light
apple
maybe
and
a
touch
of
grain
as
it
warmed
some
light
pepper
like
spice
starts
to
come
forward
nearly
spot
on
as
i
take
the
first
taste
i
expierence
just
what
i
wanted
from
this
one
a
light
perfectly
carbonated
saison
light
notes
of
fruit
spiced
up
with
hints
of
white
pepper
and
a
perfectly
balanced
mix
between
light
grain
and
fresh
grass
in
the
finish
smooth
delicate
and
perfectly
drainkable
i
was
very
impressed
by
just
how
good
this
one
was
ps
its
also
rather
belchy
drink
with
something
anything
to
eat
lager
color
with
thick
creamy
head
and
high
carbonation
sweet
grapefruitlemon
upfront
and
then
the
flavor
changes
to
parsley
sage
rosemary
thyme
just
like
it
says
on
the
bottle
this
beer
is
just
springfresh
thats
the
best
way
to
describe
it
if
it
was
sold
in
6
packs
or
4
packs
i
would
definitely
buy
it
exploded
out
of
the
bottle
super
slow
pour
didnt
do
much
good
explosive
frothy
airy
off
white
head
body
is
a
light
golden
straw
color
slightly
hazy
lacing
is
super
chunky
and
sporadic
nose
is
rosemary
thyme
and
parsley
this
should
be
served
with
the
roast
chicken
at
hammersleys
bistro
in
boston
what
holy
fucking
beer
meets
meat
harmony
that
would
be
tastes
like
mint
and
basil
wow
not
like
any
saison
i
have
the
herbs
arent
subtle
this
is
slightly
drying
and
acidic
such
a
surprise
spicy
nice
hint
of
citrus
feel
is
moderate
with
good
carbonation
overall
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
just
wasnt
as
herby
as
i
had
expected
but
still
good
the
taste
starts
sweat
from
the
malts
then
goes
herbal
and
floral
in
the
middle
thanks
to
the
hops
and
other
interesting
ingredients
the
palate
is
dry
and
bubbly
with
the
alcohol
just
on
the
verge
of
being
sessionable
this
beer
drinks
like
a
session
saison
for
the
summer
do
this
would
be
a
great
summer
to
fall
transitional
beer
and
im
pretty
sure
that
is
exactly
when
this
was
released
last
year
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
octoberfest
or
summer
ale
easily
drinkable
and
just
a
few
will
do
a
great
job
on
you
drink
is
somewhat
soso
despite
the
overpoweringly
intense
experience
of
drinking
this
beer
its
just
a
touch
on
the
a
bit
too
much
scale
for
my
taste
although
id
be
hardpressed
to
tell
any
saison
lovers
that
something
else
would
be
a
better
choice
giant
fluffy
white
cap
soapy
bubbles
clumpy
lacing
and
good
head
retention
the
beer
was
a
bit
hazy
and
gold
in
colour
nice
aroma
lemons
and
citrus
floral
hint
of
tartness
fruity
a
bit
powdery
sturdy
bitterness
lemons
and
crackery
malt
a
little
bready
less
fruity
than
in
the
aroma
mild
peppery
spice
in
the
dry
finish
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
refreshing
and
tasty
an
enjoyable
farmhouse
ale
with
solid
hop
character
it
had
a
hazy
pour
with
i
would
say
a
2
5
finger
head
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
it
smelled
immediately
of
herbs
but
mainly
thyme
when
i
tasted
the
beer
i
got
a
slight
amount
of
sage
followed
by
rosemary
it
finished
with
the
grassy
bitterness
of
parsley
the
mouthfeel
was
actually
surprised
me
and
was
a
bit
spicy
overall
it
was
a
new
experience
for
me
i
never
had
a
very
strong
herbal
beer
before
so
this
was
hard
to
rate
but
i
do
think
that
this
beer
would
go
good
with
a
roast
chicken
or
it
could
probably
hold
up
to
a
grilled
pork
chop
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
cloudyhazy
yellow
with
big
carbonation
left
a
two
finger
foamy
head
aromas
biggest
highlights
are
lemon
peel
and
rosemary
i
admit
that
i
am
not
yet
skilled
at
recognizing
all
the
qualities
of
a
saison
as
i
am
somewhat
new
to
the
style
but
at
first
taste
i
can
tell
that
i
will
enjoy
this
brew
a
pleasant
tartness
is
met
with
creative
herbal
qualities
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
can
however
detect
the
rosemary
and
thyme
the
mouthfeel
is
much
like
the
few
belgian
style
beers
that
ive
recently
started
trying
with
big
carbonation
almost
like
a
champagne
very
pleasant
beer
that
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
i
was
on
the
fence
on
whether
i
liked
this
or
the
stone
version
more
at
first
but
when
i
think
of
which
i
would
rather
have
again
in
the
future
i
think
it
would
be
the
victory
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
head
and
some
pretty
lacing
the
aroma
is
lots
of
cooking
spice
sage
celery
powder
parsley
and
some
nice
fruity
and
floral
hoppy
notes
the
flavor
is
again
fruity
but
dry
with
a
bit
of
crackery
malt
and
plenty
of
bitterness
there
is
some
cooking
spice
in
there
as
well
that
makes
for
a
bracing
bitterness
at
times
the
glass
finishes
somewhat
transformed
of
what
it
was
at
first
sip
messy
and
oddly
minerally
oddly
this
seemed
less
focused
on
the
cooking
spice
than
did
the
stone
one
however
there
seemed
to
be
more
characteristics
identifiable
as
saison
in
this
one
than
the
stone
honestly
every
one
of
these
should
be
categorized
as
herbedspiced
beers
starts
with
a
sweet
citrus
and
spicy
it
milds
and
finishes
dry
with
a
dry
mouth
the
spices
present
themselves
and
finishes
bitter
much
like
youd
get
from
licking
a
lemon
drinkability
is
good
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
a
bottle
but
its
very
nice
in
the
12
ounces
md
lively
carbonated
light
bodied
with
some
unique
flavors
the
lemon
flavors
come
through
a
bit
too
strong
but
its
still
enjoyable
i
would
have
again
just
wouldnt
seek
it
out
enjoyable
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
farmhouse
style
but
this
one
put
a
nice
spin
on
the
style
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
not
the
style
i
usually
drink
but
its
quite
nice
i
would
absolutely
buy
moredrink
more
of
this
i
would
also
love
to
try
this
with
some
rosmary
grilled
chicken
this
summer
i
bought
two
12oz
bottles
of
the
dogfishhead
and
stone
versions
of
the
saison
du
buff
and
drank
them
side
by
side
on
two
separate
occasions
into
a
pint
glass
very
light
pour
with
a
small
12
finger
head
minimal
lacing
but
a
small
film
remains
atop
the
beer
as
you
drink
much
less
head
and
much
less
lacing
than
the
stone
version
citrus
right
up
front
with
some
other
herbs
i
think
im
getting
some
rosemary
good
smell
herbal
and
hoppy
taste
much
more
smooth
than
the
stone
version
on
both
occasions
imo
it
tastes
better
than
the
stone
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
much
less
carbonated
less
punch
than
stone
final
verdict
while
victory
looked
and
smelled
better
i
did
like
stones
as
well
will
i
have
either
again
no
drinkability
this
spices
in
this
saison
didnt
quite
work
instead
of
adding
taste
they
kind
of
drowned
out
the
beer
just
didnt
work
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
during
the
summer
this
would
probably
my
go
to
with
a
slice
of
lemon
or
orange
to
garnish
still
reasonably
drinkable
in
winter
too
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
white
head
smells
mostly
like
saison
yeast
flavors
of
oranges
rosemary
other
spices
and
yeast
come
through
very
yeasty
in
flavor
which
is
odd
because
i
poured
myself
a
very
clear
sample
some
black
pepper
notes
going
on
at
the
end
of
the
sip
very
acidic
feeling
thin
body
which
is
traditional
for
the
style
i
wish
i
had
served
it
colder
and
on
a
really
hot
day
liking
victorys
and
stones
saison
du
buff
so
much
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
i
had
troubles
with
it
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
unique
but
i
just
didnt
really
like
drinking
this
beer
very
much
although
it
did
get
better
as
time
went
on
i
would
not
call
it
one
of
dfhs
best
d
easy
drinker
id
really
like
to
try
this
on
a
hot
scorching
summers
day
perhaps
odysseus
and
gullivers
first
reactions
werent
incorrectany
giant
even
those
that
are
benign
or
gracious
cannot
escape
the
nature
of
his
size
a
giants
tiny
misstep
is
viewed
from
the
lower
perspective
as
an
enormous
error
a
short
stumble
is
seen
as
a
crashing
fall
because
saisons
are
best
when
balanced
any
tipping
toward
one
extreme
or
another
can
be
a
tragedy
to
the
essence
of
the
styleso
when
a
trio
of
brewing
giants
makes
such
an
imbalance
it
is
unfortunately
magnified
in
the
mouth
and
heart
of
this
reviewer
i
do
always
give
credit
to
dogfish
head
brewers
they
can
come
up
with
all
sorts
of
different
variations
on
beers
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
stones
version
since
the
idea
behind
the
beer
comes
through
more
than
the
hopheavy
out
of
san
diego
county
but
then
again
does
one
prefer
an
onslaught
of
hops
or
an
onslaught
of
herbs
i
prefer
the
hops
but
the
thought
behind
this
beer
was
the
herbs
so
dfhs
may
be
truer
to
the
concept
but
the
stone
version
might
be
more
drinkable
drinkability
decent
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
though
just
not
my
style
darker
in
colour
with
less
head
than
stone
but
more
head
than
victory
smells
mostly
of
sage
cant
smell
the
other
spices
very
well
tastes
stongly
of
sage
and
thyme
i
dont
get
any
parsley
maybe
some
rosemary
highly
carbonated
fairly
tasty
and
very
drinkable
future
outlook
solid
collaboration
nevertheless
brewed
once
so
this
was
it
d
a
tasty
interesting
beer
mouthfeel
is
approtiate
for
the
style
lively
carbonation
and
prickly
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
dry
finish
the
herbs
are
dominant
but
never
overpowering
and
make
each
sip
exciting
and
different
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
to
enjoy
numbingly
yummy
d
reminds
me
of
dogfishs
sahtea
really
heavy
on
the
herbals
like
i
said
reminds
me
more
of
cold
tea
than
beer
drink
5
a
pale
cloudy
golden
beer
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
and
good
lace
light
peppery
aroma
with
a
grainy
sweet
background
lemon
peppery
washes
over
the
tongue
with
a
clean
dry
finish
has
a
very
light
sweet
aftertaste
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
d
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
the
herbs
were
so
present
not
at
all
what
i
expected
often
its
hard
to
taste
infused
beers
that
being
said
it
had
great
balance
for
something
that
likely
began
its
life
as
something
of
a
dare
i
give
it
an
a
just
for
the
sheer
imagination
of
it
never
would
have
thought
it
possible
eally
inspiring
for
a
home
brewer
d
i
was
surprised
at
its
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
it
i
would
definitely
consider
going
to
the
store
and
buying
this
one
had
this
beer
at
some
of
the
local
alehouses
here
and
in
bottles
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
with
some
hues
of
yellow
the
head
forms
actually
very
nicely
and
does
not
go
overboard
the
aroma
is
of
a
very
light
floating
on
air
spice
that
tingles
the
nose
a
bit
the
taste
is
just
plain
refreshing
and
with
a
great
earthy
spice
to
it
drink
ability
is
very
high
with
this
low
alch
level
and
great
flavor
that
does
not
over
whelm
the
taste
buds
whenever
i
see
this
brew
on
the
shelf
it
is
a
must
pick
up
try
to
keep
as
much
as
i
can
in
the
beer
fridge
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
light
but
flavorful
belgians
and
green
or
chamomile
tea
this
should
be
right
up
your
alley
but
otherwise
will
not
likely
inspire
great
cravings
for
you
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
by
the
end
of
a
glass
i
am
coming
around
a
bit
even
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
can
really
tell
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
as
for
drinkability
it
is
definitely
easy
to
drink
but
the
complex
and
in
your
face
flavors
from
all
the
ingredients
makes
it
a
little
too
much
to
have
a
bunch
of
however
for
the
high
alcohol
content
it
is
not
so
apparent
when
you
are
drinking
it
it
is
no
surprise
that
dogfish
heads
version
of
saison
du
buff
is
just
as
enjoyable
as
stones
version
this
is
a
killer
recipe
cooked
up
and
executed
some
of
the
best
in
the
business
next
up
victory
saison
du
buff
d
good
very
tasty
beer
one
of
my
favorites
of
2010
preferred
the
other
versions
but
this
is
good
too
really
hope
they
resurrect
this
one
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
billowing
white
head
after
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
out
of
the
dogfish
bottled
version
very
herbal
nose
rosemary
is
significantly
dominate
lemony
citrus
and
sage
play
a
secondary
role
you
also
get
a
faint
doughy
yeast
aroma
flavor
was
pretty
herbal
as
well
i
actually
got
a
minty
note
middrink
that
clung
about
even
after
the
swallow
for
the
style
i
found
this
to
be
oddly
refreshing
i
really
like
saisons
but
this
doesnt
have
the
farmy
outdoor
angle
it
is
however
a
really
good
beer
drinks
like
a
4
percenter
drinkability
i
like
it
i
dont
love
it
but
im
glad
i
got
it
and
im
conjuring
up
all
sorts
of
meals
and
dishes
to
pair
this
with
omelettes
salads
falafel
good
gyros
overall
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
gruit
ale
a
style
that
im
quite
fond
of
the
creativity
angle
also
inspires
me
to
bump
my
score
up
a
bit
drinkabilty
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
very
strange
spices
mixed
in
giving
this
a
odd
flavor
would
like
to
try
this
without
the
rosemary
and
sage
could
be
a
decent
pilsnar
with
strong
hop
presence
like
victory
prima
pils
not
for
me
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
strange
brew
drinkability
i
could
have
this
again
for
a
saison
might
be
just
my
thing
overall
im
dissapointed
i
didnt
pick
up
more
of
this
an
underrated
beer
based
on
the
averages
ive
seen
the
nose
is
one
of
the
best
ive
experienced
d
i
could
drink
a
few
its
just
a
bit
sweet
and
its
a
lighter
ale
so
its
not
too
filling
poured
into
a
wine
glass
straw
yellow
cloudy
with
fluffy
white
head
that
ticks
around
pretty
well
impressive
looking
saison
thin
malt
aromas
light
grains
with
an
underlying
herbal
vegetal
smell
lemony
and
refreshing
very
enticing
albeit
somewhat
muted
crisp
light
flavors
of
grainy
savory
malt
with
lightly
sweet
lemony
citrus
notes
herbal
and
planty
with
a
rich
earthiness
a
nice
mix
between
sweet
and
savory
aspects
that
makes
it
very
refreshing
light
and
airy
mouthfeel
very
bubbly
and
silky
an
all
around
great
beer
that
will
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
often
d
i
could
go
all
night
d
very
drinkable
this
should
be
available
in
6packs
all
year
long
one
of
the
most
unique
and
amazing
beers
ive
ever
had
major
props
to
all
three
brewers
smell
has
various
spices
the
rosemary
and
thyme
do
make
themselves
noticed
very
herbal
the
taste
includes
more
those
italian
spices
along
with
some
basic
pepper
along
with
lemon
and
both
sweetness
and
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
is
a
fairly
easy
to
drink
farmhouse
ale
from
dfh
in
this
collaboration
with
victory
and
stone
personally
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
d
a
beer
brewed
with
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
is
a
gimmick
these
spices
werent
selected
for
beer
purposes
but
for
noveltys
sake
i
can
discern
the
thyme
and
possibly
the
rosemary
but
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
parsley
can
have
any
impact
at
all
regardless
i
did
like
the
stone
version
so
this
was
a
very
disappointing
surprise
i
cant
believe
how
different
this
was
drinkability
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
i
prefer
the
stone
version
over
this
which
isnt
saying
this
is
bad
the
beer
itself
looked
almost
like
a
lager
in
color
the
thing
that
stuck
out
instantly
was
the
smell
of
grapefruit
with
a
hint
of
pine
needles
or
something
it
tasted
great
and
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
i
think
it
makes
for
a
great
summer
beer
and
recommend
to
anyone
who
has
a
chance
to
try
it
drink
the
3rd
of
the
vertical
all
tasty
beers
but
i
think
the
dfh
is
1
stone
2
and
victory
3
d
all
in
all
im
not
impressed
with
this
enough
to
ever
try
it
again
this
collaboration
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
as
stones
was
the
only
one
id
try
again
still
points
for
trying
we
are
going
to
pair
ours
with
some
roasted
chicken
and
root
vegetables
i
think
it
will
work
out
nicely
pours
a
very
light
cloudy
gold
with
lots
of
head
that
lingers
the
smell
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
this
is
herbs
100
dominated
by
the
rosemary
its
pretty
drinkable
but
the
herbs
are
overpowering
which
downgrades
the
beers
score
loads
of
carbonation
help
me
on
the
drinkability
factor
reminds
me
of
a
sparkling
wine
overall
in
my
opinion
the
dogfish
head
is
a
more
drinkable
overall
more
balanced
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
better
conversely
i
feel
victorys
offering
is
a
bit
more
extreme
really
focusing
on
the
spices
and
herbs
which
certainly
makes
it
more
unique
but
hurts
it
in
flavor
and
drinkability
id
like
to
try
stones
as
well
but
havent
been
able
to
find
it
near
me
hopefully
i
can
land
it
and
finish
the
collaboration
overall
this
was
my
first
beer
with
the
thanksgiving
feast
and
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
very
tasty
and
appropriate
a
great
twist
on
the
classic
saison
d
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
a
bit
more
balance
in
the
herbs
would
be
nice
but
thats
a
small
quibble
overall
a
solid
offering
2
5
d
not
terrible
but
not
too
good
either
im
not
sure
where
they
went
wrong
but
the
herbs
dont
work
as
well
in
this
one
as
it
some
others
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
on
occasion
but
not
for
3bottle
very
drinkable
colder
the
better
for
me
i
could
sip
these
all
saison
the
6
8
is
nice
yet
soft
not
boozy
at
all
nice
job
to
all
three
breweries
slainte
a
lot
of
gas
is
in
this
beer
which
makes
it
hard
to
drink
also
the
flavor
isnt
as
smooth
as
the
victory
saison
i
dont
think
i
would
get
a
second
bottle
of
this
version
of
the
beer
d
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
twist
on
the
style
this
is
an
oddly
tasty
beer
i
certianly
couldnt
sit
with
this
for
an
evening
but
this
is
a
good
after
dinner
beer
a
great
interpretation
of
the
farmhouse
style
not
bad
now
of
course
i
have
to
try
the
other
2
from
stone
and
victory
d
despite
all
of
the
herbal
flavors
the
beer
is
actually
quite
drinkable
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
because
it
is
very
unique
drinkability
average
i
keep
sipping
to
try
to
catch
the
more
ephemeral
herb
notes
but
the
bitterness
keeps
me
from
downing
it
herbal
component
seems
overdone
and
the
chalkiness
is
more
prominent
than
i
would
prefer
but
this
one
is
really
very
approachable
overall
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
ok
the
herbs
were
definitely
interesting
and
made
for
a
very
unique
beer
but
im
not
sure
its
a
flavor
id
want
often
in
a
beer
cool
beer
that
was
definitely
worth
trying
though
the
mouth
is
highly
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
bubbly
and
harsh
not
the
smoothest
beer
out
there
spritzy
is
usually
par
for
this
style
but
this
kicks
it
up
a
notch
the
herbs
are
mellowed
out
some
in
the
flavor
earthy
flavors
meld
with
subtle
herbs
slightly
savory
theres
more
of
a
hoppresence
in
this
one
over
the
stone
version
this
is
unique
and
a
musttry
and
though
i
prefer
this
one
to
stones
its
still
not
something
i
would
reach
for
very
often
its
interesting
though
pretty
good
not
sure
how
it
compares
to
the
stone
or
victory
versions
though
d
quite
an
experience
recommended
to
everyone
at
least
once
this
is
not
an
everyday
sipper
but
kudos
to
dogfish
for
again
stretching
the
limits
of
what
beer
can
be
very
close
to
stones
version
aroma
and
flavor
not
quite
as
strong
though
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
spicy
but
rosemary
stand
out
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
a
spice
bite
and
rosemary
and
thyme
a
mellow
malt
to
balance
it
a
spicy
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
burny
spice
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
it
but
kind
of
feel
a
bit
too
italian
like
spices
d
great
saison
collaborated
very
tasty
despite
high
alcohol
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
stuff
a
great
sour
saison
my
second
saison
du
all
pretty
good
d
not
as
good
as
the
stone
version
but
a
nice
beer
the
spices
are
a
little
much
at
times
like
almost
everything
that
dfh
puts
out
this
beer
is
fullflavored
complex
and
well
balanced
too
bad
this
is
a
limited
release
because
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
it
compares
to
the
victory
version
of
this
beer
which
i
have
on
deck
to
try
next
drinkibility
a
very
creative
use
of
unusual
spices
i
feel
that
they
compliment
the
standard
saison
characteristics
hidden
within
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
a
different
one
at
that
saison
du
buff
is
an
impressive
saison
i
recall
the
stone
release
being
very
similar
to
this
from
dfh
i
do
think
this
one
has
a
better
look
and
performs
a
little
better
in
the
drinkability
department
maybe
i
just
drank
this
on
the
right
night
nonetheless
i
am
a
firm
believer
that
saison
du
buff
is
one
fine
saison
i
dont
really
care
if
its
brewed
at
stone
dfh
or
victory
im
now
quite
certain
theyre
all
impressive
find
a
bottle
of
each
or
perhaps
a
few
of
each
crisp
lively
mouthfeel
the
strong
herbal
characters
and
bitterness
wear
on
me
after
a
while
not
the
type
of
brew
i
find
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
record
im
5
minutes
into
my
pour
and
there
is
not
end
to
this
head
in
sight
taste
is
lightly
zested
possibly
a
little
soapy
maybe
some
yeast
gone
wrong
in
this
batch
finish
plays
the
same
tune
yeasty
and
some
great
grain
spices
drinks
a
little
below
what
id
expect
out
of
this
style
the
bottle
says
it
is
brewed
with
parsley
rosemary
sage
and
thyme
its
definitely
different
it
has
sahti
like
elements
and
in
my
opinion
tends
to
lean
that
way
more
than
it
does
a
true
saison
it
pours
a
pale
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
two
finger
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
smell
is
a
complex
mix
of
spices
the
aforementioned
spices
combine
to
give
it
a
piny
almost
spruce
like
sappy
aroma
the
taste
too
is
piney
and
again
reminds
me
of
a
sahti
it
drinks
light
and
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
its
decently
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
one
is
definitely
fine
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
i
feel
its
a
desired
taste
easy
drinking
and
better
than
expected
well
done
drinkable
oh
so
drinkability
4
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
going
beer
goes
down
pretty
quickly
i
havent
tried
the
stone
or
victory
versions
yet
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
them
d
really
tasty
like
this
one
much
more
than
the
stone
version
would
definitely
have
again
drinkability
good
saison
du
buff
is
aight
on
the
whole
its
pretty
decent
i
really
like
the
cohesion
of
the
aroma
however
that
doesnt
hold
true
for
the
taste
factor
in
the
carbonation
im
a
little
more
iffy
on
it
regardless
it
was
a
worthwhile
shot
d
pretty
interesting
ingredients
listed
on
the
bottle
for
sure
just
think
they
go
better
on
food
rather
than
beer
found
this
one
on
the
harder
side
to
drink
just
didnt
have
the
beer
taste
that
i
really
enjoy
single
from
some
whole
foods
d
4
d
a
little
off
for
the
style
but
still
very
good
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
definitely
love
to
have
this
with
italian
food
because
of
all
the
herbs
in
the
flavor
however
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
or
going
out
and
getting
more
anytime
soon
a
very
unique
beer
and
i
would
guess
that
its
a
loveitorhateit
kind
of
affair
with
the
herb
choices
im
leaning
towards
the
loveit
side
light
refreshing
sessionable
and
sets
itself
apart
from
other
beers
even
of
saisons
and
in
a
good
way
in
my
opinion
id
like
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
hand
in
the
future
drinkability
is
high
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
get
palate
fatigue
from
the
herbs
done
very
nicely
worth
replicating
at
home
since
i
have
a
nice
supply
of
fresh
rosemary
in
the
garden
same
impression
as
the
stone
and
victory
versions
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
dfh
goblet
pours
a
semihazy
orangegold
much
lighter
than
the
stone
variation
with
a
rocky
two
inch
bright
white
head
and
with
thick
strands
of
lacing
exposed
during
the
tasting
nose
was
herbal
minty
with
a
suggestion
of
rosemary
and
sage
the
herbal
quality
melds
a
bit
more
than
the
stone
variation
and
seems
a
bit
more
earthy
with
a
slightly
acrid
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
consistency
with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
prickly
culminating
in
a
semidry
finish
perhaps
a
little
more
balanced
than
the
stone
version
however
still
somewhat
difficult
to
drink
by
ones
self
drinkability
is
above
average
due
to
the
light
body
and
citrus
notes
and
while
the
herbal
notes
made
me
keep
taking
sip
after
sip
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
brewers
were
going
for
i
cant
say
this
is
a
beer
i
would
purchase
again
and
the
trifecta
is
finally
complete
like
the
other
iterations
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
straw
topped
by
a
strong
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
sage
greens
coriander
parsley
beyond
the
darker
miscellaneous
greens
already
mentioned
onions
cardamom
and
orange
peel
the
taste
is
similarly
herby
and
spicy
though
to
a
much
greater
and
bitterer
extent
some
gourd
flesh
finds
its
way
in
there
too
along
with
a
hint
of
walnuts
near
the
finish
line
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
like
the
others
in
the
set
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
the
multiherb
and
spice
combo
at
least
not
in
this
particular
delivery
method
anyway
i
liked
this
better
than
the
victory
variety
and
the
flavor
profile
is
possibly
better
than
ever
d
solid
drinkability
definite
six
pack
worthy
but
ended
up
liking
the
stone
brewed
one
better
nice
enjoyment
factor
d
as
with
most
dogfish
head
brews
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
have
another
nice
carbonation
pleasant
beer
cheers
d
a
very
interesting
saison
to
be
sure
i
dont
know
if
ill
run
right
out
and
buy
out
any
inventories
any
time
soon
i
am
curious
to
see
how
the
other
brewers
offerings
compare
drinkability
for
this
one
really
lies
in
the
tastes
of
the
drinker
its
the
most
herbal
of
the
group
and
that
can
build
on
the
palate
however
within
one
serving
it
also
offers
a
great
deal
of
complexity
12
ounce
bottle
has
bottled
in
2010
d
etched
onto
the
neck
of
the
bottle
pours
light
golden
amber
lightly
hazed
loose
off
white
head
stays
and
falls
to
a
nice
looking
thick
film
again
loose
and
leaves
ample
fine
bits
of
lace
herbal
spicy
nose
leads
directly
to
a
herbal
earthy
peppery
lime
infused
style
of
saison
thats
not
all
that
to
my
liking
something
just
seems
off
here
so
many
other
saisons
out
there
that
i
prefer
to
this
one
d
highly
drinkable
saison
with
a
distinctively
american
bent
thanks
to
the
hoppiness
an
interesting
collaboration
the
dfh
version
definitely
emphasizes
the
stone
and
dfh
aspects
morehigh
hop
levels
stone
that
emphasize
flavor
over
astringency
and
bitterness
dfh
a
solid
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
i
definitely
see
this
beer
more
as
a
cooking
beer
for
recipes
like
chicken
or
pasta
and
subsequently
paired
with
good
innovation
by
the
collaborative
brewers
just
something
that
didnt
wow
me
transparent
golden
in
body
topped
by
excessively
large
white
head
smells
of
deep
citrus
lemon
pineapple
floral
notes
some
funk
tastes
of
pineapple
lemon
zest
sourness
green
apples
and
pineapple
finishes
out
the
drink
light
in
body
with
some
lively
carbonation
that
goes
well
with
the
flavors
a
refreshing
saison
that
gives
us
a
reason
to
applaud
american
craft
breweries
drinkability
is
good
its
certainly
a
very
different
and
unique
approach
to
the
style
but
its
quite
a
solid
and
tasty
brew
the
spices
make
for
a
oneofakind
experience
now
if
only
i
could
just
find
the
stone
and
victory
versions
around
here
to
compare
notes
intensely
herbal
this
paired
beautifully
with
an
oven
baked
lemon
salmon
victorys
version
is
quite
nice
too
and
the
flavor
profile
is
very
akin
but
dfh
has
a
presence
and
a
touch
of
intensity
above
this
and
victorys
review
are
fairly
similar
albeit
noting
that
appreciation
drinkability
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
du
series
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
frothy
looking
white
head
that
stands
about
an
inch
high
and
vanishes
slowly
into
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
bitter
hops
as
with
the
stone
and
victory
versions
of
this
beer
the
herbs
used
in
the
making
of
this
really
shine
nicely
and
compliment
the
aroma
with
a
nice
earthy
aroma
the
herbs
blend
together
well
but
the
rosemary
is
what
i
can
smell
the
most
the
flavor
on
this
one
seems
to
be
dominated
by
the
herbs
i
can
really
taste
everything
and
its
finished
with
a
bit
of
hop
bittering
not
bad
at
all
but
this
one
seems
heavier
on
the
herb
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nothing
really
bad
about
it
good
carbonation
nice
medium
body
and
good
flavors
make
it
unfortunate
that
this
is
a
one
shot
d
very
enjoyable
saison
having
this
side
by
side
with
the
victory
version
this
one
stands
out
above
the
victory
in
its
aroma
and
flavor
intensity
and
spice
presence
quite
enjoyable
a
color
is
a
light
to
medium
straw
there
is
a
layer
of
thin
white
head
as
well
as
a
few
spots
along
the
side
of
the
glass
3
50
s
what
a
totally
wild
nose
i
pick
up
lemon
zest
and
rosemary
i
also
see
that
thyme
is
part
of
the
recipe
and
i
am
able
to
discern
some
though
the
nose
is
quite
prominent
it
has
a
light
crispness
to
it
interesting
aromas
all
around
4
00
t
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
hard
earthiness
is
present
on
the
tail
of
the
beer
thyme
and
rosemary
are
evident
as
well
as
some
grassy
flavors
there
is
a
good
deal
of
lemon
zest
and
pepper
very
dry
and
almost
puckering
3

to

small

3
50
d
saisons
arent
generally
my
style
but
saison
du
buff
is
quite
enjoyable
i
have
victorys
version
sitting
in
the
cellar
which
ill
look
forward
to
trying
4
00
d
the
lame
mouthfeel
actually
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
in
the
sense
of
chuggable
and
there
is
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
in
the
smell
taste
but
overall
not
something
id
revisit
eh
not
bad
actually
much
more
subdued
herb
factor
nice
and
subtle
but
definitely
present
theres
a
bit
too
much
lemon
going
on
here
as
well
not
entirely
sure
where
thats
coming
from
odd
grainyness
sort
of
like
an
average
lager
hmm
messy
mouthfeel
all
in
all
this
is
a
cool
beer
but
really
not
coming
together
well
the
herbal
trio
is
an
interesting
idea
but
the
sage
and
rosemary
are
just
too
strong
maybe
different
herbs
different
result
but
this
ends
up
a
jumble
still
admirable
a
very
interesting
beer
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
flavors
are
pretty
bold
good
to
try
once
drinkabilit
is
good
surprisingly
refreshing
for
being
so
dry
this
is
a
phenomenally
arrogant
beer
typically
when
i
say
that
its
a
complement
in
this
case
its
not
these
4
herbs
with
the
exception
of
parsley
are
each
strong
as
hell
in
their
own
right
and
typically
are
not
mixed
at
least
not
more
than
2
at
a
time
they
tried
to
do
the
impossible
and
found
it
impossible
not
nearly
what
id
expect
from
a
collaboration
between
these
3
brewers
part
3
of
my
review
and
wow
look
at
the
head
difference
between
this
and
its
victory
counterpart
is
my
first
thought
next
is
this
beer
is
noticeably
cloudier
too
the
smell
is
much
spicier
and
not
as
noticeably
hoppy
taste
is
intense
it
does
not
have
as
light
a
mouthfeel
as
the
other
2
and
its
complexity
is
almost
overwhelming
with
a
bitter
finish
the
tastes
that
i
can
pick
up
on
are
a
bit
of
citrus
some
sage
at
this
point
id
say
it
is
good
drinkability
but
of
the
3
id
have
to
give
stone
the
winner
for
best
with
dog
fish
being
a
close
second
12oz
bottle
4
which
was
odd
because
the
victory
version
was
only
3
but
the
difference
was
apparent
after
drinking
them
both
this
was
orange
and
had
an
initially
hoppy
smell
almost
a
citrus
quality
and
then
herbs
the
flavor
was
clean
saison
with
the
sage
seeming
to
dominate
more
than
the
rosemary
and
thyme
which
i
thought
were
heavy
in
the
stone
version
very
easy
to
drink
and
probably
the
best
of
the
three
du
buffs
d
ehhh
its
interesting
enough
but
probably
a
oneoff
for
me
i
love
simon
and
garfunkel
so
im
happy
to
actually
have
a
palette
in
mind
for
this
song
beyond
the
herbs
though
just
an
okay
beer
d
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
belgian
beer
although
im
starting
to
get
there
but
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
bought
all
3
bottles
of
the
collab
so
im
interested
to
see
if
there
is
any
differences
between
them
being
brewed
at
different
breweries
overall
this
is
well
made
saison
refreshing
but
still
has
a
ton
of
flavor
even
more
herbacious
than
most
this
is
literally
making
me
crave
some
seared
salmon
paired
with
a
fresh
salad
i
wish
they
made
more
of
this
beer
is
a
light
gauzy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
smell
is
a
complex
blast
of
yeast
with
some
citrus
and
grass
taste
starts
with
some
grassyness
and
is
crisp
and
a
touch
bitter
the
finish
has
some
nice
herby
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
not
at
all
heavy
its
quite
drinkable
all
in
all
a
very
good
and
subtly
interesting
beer
the
flavor
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
but
thats
ok
its
a
good
refreshing
farmhouse
ale
with
some
very
nice
herby
and
grassy
undertones
definitely
refreshing
and
has
that
farmhouse
palate
fairly
balanced
flavors
but
strangely
boring
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
a
quality
brew
that
just
doesnt
get
there
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
crisp
yellow
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
crisp
sweet
malts
and
a
nice
bit
of
belgian
spice
the
taste
is
a
nice
smooth
blend
of
sweet
malts
smooth
citrus
hops
and
a
nice
blend
of
spices
such
as
rosemary
and
thyme
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
smooth
with
its
6
8
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
very
good
saison
even
on
draft
final
verdict
while
victory
looked
and
smelled
better
i
enjoyed
the
taste
of
dfh
and
while
i
would
i
would
never
turn
either
down
i
would
take
dfh
by
a
slim
margin
the
spicing
gets
a
touch
heavy
it
feels
like
i
can
taste
straight
up
dried
parsley
here
and
there
however
theres
a
big
herbal
and
lightly
citrus
punch
of
hops
to
open
that
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
pils
or
hopped
saison
thats
very
cool
the
malt
is
mild
dry
and
biscuity
with
the
spices
blending
into
the
clove
and
subtle
fruit
notes
overall
a
very
different
but
delicious
beer
check
this
out
really
beautiful
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
retains
impressively
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
notes
of
lemon
pepper
basil
thyme
rosemary
orange
marmalade
cane
sugar
fruity
esters
bread
dough
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
taste
has
notes
of
bread
dough
and
hay
upfront
along
with
lemon
pepper
and
basil
thyme
and
rosemary
along
with
candy
sugar
fruity
esters
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sprightly
and
drinkability
is
good
the
spices
seem
less
oppressive
in
this
iteration
than
in
the
stone
version
which
makes
this
much
more
enjoyable
d
not
exactly
a
beer
that
i
could
have
several
of
the
herbs
just
dont
mix
as
well
as
i
would
hope
with
the
beer
its
a
great
idea
just
one
that
i
think
ill
limit
to
one
bottle
though
carb
is
just
a
touch
sharp
but
the
medium
body
is
great
it
finishes
with
some
refreshing
sensations
a
touch
of
lingering
spices
and
mild
bitterness
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
even
more
that
the
stone
version
a
really
good
take
on
the
recipe
and
ingredients
the
spices
seem
to
fit
more
and
the
hops
make
this
really
sing
one
that
ill
be
happy
to
try
again
and
again
drinkability
this
is
just
a
very
clean
saison
and
one
of
the
better
american
versions
i
have
had
the
flavors
of
lemon
and
pepper
just
jump
another
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
the
alcohol
is
super
well
hidden
a
great
beer
love
the
collaboration
between
these
guys
as
well
if
only
this
was
offered
once
a
year
in
the
summer
such
a
good
refresher
drinkability
is
good
here
of
course
if
it
were
more
available
d
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
alot
did
mind
it
would
have
again
just
not
my
favorite
style
d
took
me
a
while
to
drink
just
one
its
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
night
its
just
not
that
kind
of
beer
tasty
brew
and
something
id
most
likely
drink
again
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
color
and
creates
a
half
finger
head
with
adequate
lacing
the
herbal
smell
is
overwhelming
and
smells
more
like
thyme
and
sage
a
very
grassy
smell
nothing
like
anything
ive
had
before
the
initial
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
until
you
swallow
and
then
you
go
right
back
to
that
grassy
sage
and
thyme
overkill
however
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
dogfish
says
they
are
offcentered
and
this
beer
certainly
sticks
to
that
theme
but
im
going
to
stick
with
their
more
traditional
offerings
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
yeah
its
herbal
but
the
saison
aspect
isnt
entirely
buried
and
lost
a
unique
twist
that
totally
works
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
applaud
the
attempt
but
it
just
isnt
a
hit
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
love
these
3
breweries
and
im
very
excited
to
see
a
collaboration
hopefully
there
will
be
more
to
come
d
the
large
amount
of
spice
and
herbal
presence
in
this
beer
make
a
little
hard
to
get
through
especially
when
you
are
looking
for
a
top
notch
saison
md
light
body
especially
considering
the
abv
drinkability
is
ok
for
1
glass
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
that
in
a
sitting
i
enjoy
it
but
its
more
of
a
novelty
for
me
i
really
enjoy
the
saison
style
and
this
just
does
not
do
it
justice
d
this
version
has
more
aroma
depth
that
the
stone
version
but
to
much
fizz
makes
this
taste
more
like
a
soda
pop
and
it
looses
a
lot
of
the
flavor
and
character
of
a
saison
the
aroma
is
great
but
after
a
bit
it
starts
to
take
on
an
aftershave
quality
d
i
split
a
bottle
over
dinner
and
i
have
doubts
that
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
for
what
it
is
its
great
md
mediumlight
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
gruet
style
beer
with
the
intense
herbal
qualities
interesting
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
for
a
saison
the
aroma
is
fantastic
unique
and
one
of
a
kind
the
bouquet
on
this
brew
is
phenomenal
the
phenolic
character
is
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
saisons
that
were
a
lot
cleaner
saison
dupont
hennepin
and
something
from
two
brothers
off
the
top
of
my
head
to
bandaidy
for
me
still
give
this
one
a
try
just
to
support
craft
beer
experimentation
d
hell
yes
a
very
interesting
brew
amazing
use
of
some
unconventional
ingredients
producing
a
very
interesting
tasty
brew
flavor
is
very
decent
id
say
overall
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
stone
versionhavent
had
the
victory
one
as
of
yet
a
nice
saison
reseblance
mixed
with
the
spices
medium
body
for
a
saison
though
which
is
unique
malty
too
some
crisp
citrus
fruits
and
high
carbonation
a
very
nice
drinker
and
a
great
summer
beer
booze
isnt
a
factor
another
nice
beer
from
dogfish
head
poured
a
gold
body
with
good
head
on
top
of
an
aroma
comprised
of
citric
sharpness
along
with
soft
fruit
sweetness
and
some
spices
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
a
lighttomedium
body
with
some
chewiness
and
smoothness
passes
the
tongue
there
is
a
balance
of
sweetness
like
caramel
that
balances
with
pear
rind
apple
hint
of
grape
and
without
the
sour
fruit
edge
it
still
has
a
crisp
backbite
thanks
to
carbonation
and
some
spicy
zip
wellbalanced
and
good
flavoring
and
while
not
a
unique
saison
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
a
very
interesting
beer
that
doesnt
have
the
sourness
associated
with
the
style
this
might
be
its
own
stylei
like
the
spices
which
are
remind
me
of
hops
but
are
more
biting
without
the
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
fast
moving
carbonation
overall
it
seems
the
herbs
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
here
its
an
interesting
twist
on
a
saison
but
again
not
something
i
would
be
able
to
drink
much
of
in
a
sitting
drinkability
i
found
this
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
and
one
id
be
happy
to
try
again
that
said
its
not
something
id
make
a
special
effort
to
find
it
is
a
pleasant
tasty
saison
overall
i
was
completely
impressed
with
this
beer
i
would
drink
this
constantly
if
this
was
a
regular
release
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
trying
this
but
the
brewers
clearly
know
what
theyre
doing
a
very
unique
and
good
beer
i
hope
to
grab
a
couple
more
to
enjoy
this
beer
had
nice
golden
yellow
appearance
with
moderate
white
head
off
the
pour
but
by
far
the
most
impressive
part
of
this
beer
was
the
nose
it
was
just
so
powerful
and
bright
of
the
spice
and
herbs
and
of
just
an
overall
very
nice
smelling
saison
just
a
very
unique
and
powerful
nose
the
taste
was
pretty
good
didnt
quite
live
up
the
nose
but
still
a
nice
tasting
saison
mouthfeel
was
decently
carbonated
but
crisp
a
nice
saison
but
with
all
the
unique
spices
and
flavors
going
on
not
sure
i
would
session
this
saison
as
a
session
but
still
definitely
worth
check
out
because
are
many
of
dogfish
beers
this
is
truly
very
unique
and
several
of
the
people
i
tried
it
with
liked
it
alot
more
then
me
overall
i
am
exceptionally
pleased
with
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
it
in
bottle
perhaps
that
will
be
on
the
menu
this
evening
if
you
see
this
beer
get
it
its
limited
and
is
worth
trying
and
if
you
live
within
radius
to
moes
call
to
see
if
its
still
on
tap
d
pretty
good
but
i
think
i
like
stones
version
a
bit
better
this
version
doesnt
quite
hit
the
spices
the
same
way
however
i
think
it
is
much
closer
to
a
saison
in
flavor
and
style
overall
this
is
much
more
drinkable
than
the
stone
version
but
i
was
less
impressed
with
this
version
id
reccomend
it
if
you
thought
the
stone
version
was
too
herbal
pours
into
a
flute
a
clear
bright
gold
with
champagnelike
carbonation
rocketing
to
up
through
the
ale
parsley
sage
rosemary
and
thyme
indeed
the
aromas
are
herbal
and
leafily
bitter
but
not
overbearing
in
the
least
the
taste
is
consistent
with
the
aromas
and
are
very
well
blended
and
delicate
in
their
presentation
an
exceptionally
fine
beer
whose
unusual
flavors
dont
beat
you
over
the
head
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
the
guys
at
stone
dogfish
and
victory
certainly
got
very
creative
with
their
brewing
but
i
wouldnt
say
they
struck
gold
with
this
one
its
good
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
has
a
decent
saison
start
promising
to
be
a
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
but
the
flavors
pull
way
too
far
away
from
that
to
make
drinking
this
a
struggle
probably
my
last
attempt
to
enjoy
this
beer
its
just
not
for
me
d
very
nice
beer
the
herb
flavors
arent
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
liked
but
it
is
still
very
solid
i
think
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
stone
version
poured
a
golden
slightly
hazy
color
with
an
average
head
the
smell
was
very
herbal
almost
at
first
like
basil
but
no
basil
here
it
is
rosemary
and
sage
the
taste
is
very
herbal
as
well
getting
sort
of
a
shock
of
rosemary
on
the
first
sip
but
once
the
tongue
gets
used
to
it
the
flavors
meld
together
really
well
very
very
tasty
and
so
different
great
imagination
ehre
mouthfeel
was
good
and
drinkabliity
i
tought
is
very
good
so
tasty
and
great
smelling
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
light
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
white
head
head
retention
is
very
good
and
theres
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
citrusy
hops
orange
peel
tropical
fruit
herbs
and
some
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
citrusy
hops
orange
and
lemon
peel
herbs
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
tropical
fruit
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
smooth
and
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
i
might
have
to
drink
a
bottle
of
the
stone
version
next
to
see
how
it
compares
to
this
one
although
the
stone
version
isnt
as
fresh
as
the
dfh
one
a
citrusy
saison
with
a
synthetic
nose
quality
of
citronella
i
say
synthetic
because
its
backed
with
a
body
of
something
thin
of
pure
lemon
and
heavy
herbal
a
heavy
punch
herbal
that
leaves
the
hops
in
a
lemon
oil
resin
definitely
getting
the
parsley
rosemary
sage
and
thyme
it
doesnt
have
a
blend
of
anything
of
appetite
inducing
the
hop
malt
seems
to
flop
a
bit
and
it
seems
to
be
more
so
a
hop
herb
beer
the
fresher
the
better
as
i
would
fear
it
going
sweet
drinkability
very
good
and
possibly
my
favorite
of
the
saison
du
buff
series
this
one
has
the
most
flavor
among
them
definitely
a
brew
to
seek
out
beer
is
quite
bitter
its
got
some
strong
rosemary
and
thyme
flavors
in
the
forward
palate
but
not
much
else
its
mildly
sweet
and
finishes
slightly
dry
i
do
like
this
better
than
the
stone
version
now
i
guess
i
need
to
go
get
the
victory
version
a
very
good
beer
i
still
am
unsure
if
this
is
a
saison
though
drinkability
an
excellent
saison
even
if
it
isnt
exactly
to
style
ill
be
really
interested
to
see
if
the
victory
and
stone
versions
match
up
i
guess
they
should
theoretically
since
its
the
same
recipe
poured
into
tulip
glass
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
worthy
saison
that
is
definitely
not
tostyle
the
beer
pours
an
idyllic
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
beautiful
carbonation
upon
bringing
this
beer
close
to
your
nose
you
are
presented
with
a
potent
aroma
that
is
more
associated
with
a
roast
turkey
than
a
beer
intrigued
i
took
a
sip
the
traditional
belgian
sour
is
there
in
a
crisp
clean
way
but
masked
behind
the
array
of
herbs
the
rosemary
and
thyme
i
find
are
most
prevalent
and
serve
to
brilliantly
complement
the
the
slight
malt
character
the
end
result
is
a
saison
that
is
not
only
unique
bit
highly
enjoyable
while
stone
snuck
by
dogfish
was
discovered
in
a
happy
coincidence
victory
will
be
hunted
down
overall
it
is
an
interesting
brew
but
it
gets
tiring
after
a
little
while
at
least
it
was
only
a
one
off
drinkability
the
stone
beer
is
a
bit
smoother
and
has
more
complexity
the
spices
are
more
in
the
background
and
after
taste
in
the
dfh
version
the
spices
are
too
up
front
and
dominate
the
charateristics
of
the
beer
its
tough
to
remember
that
this
is
a
saison
d
still
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
fresh
with
that
spice
cabinet
kick
the
body
has
a
solid
presence
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
dancing
on
your
tongue
overall
very
drinkable
with
some
interesting
flavors
hiding
throughout
d
much
like
stones
except
price
per
bottle
is
much
cheaper
and
would
be
cheaper
to
have
a
few
overall
a
very
enjoyable
experience
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
new
to
saisons
this
is
a
good
but
different
take
or
if
you
are
bored
with
the
saisons
youve
been
drinking
pale
golden
color
with
mild
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
lasting
film
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
aroma
comes
out
only
with
warming
a
bit
of
paler
malt
and
then
strong
herbal
notes
im
getting
more
of
the
rosemary
and
thyme
than
anything
tastes
similar
in
that
there
are
strong
herbal
notes
on
top
of
an
otherwise
unremarkable
saison
bitterness
is
high
but
not
necessarily
due
to
hopping
which
appears
to
be
largely
grassy
and
herbal
as
well
mf
is
slick
but
could
be
creamier
as
it
stands
the
beer
lies
flat
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
flavors
in
this
one
make
it
a
tough
drink
definitely
interesting
just
not
exactly
the
most
enjoyable
beer
ive
ever
had
dm
light
crisp
and
refreshing
that
tickles
the
tongue
great
beer
for
the
season
i
like
the
creativity
flavor
is
complex
and
runs
over
the
palate
satisfying
all
parts
after
the
assault
of
carbonation
theres
a
citrusy
pale
ale
component
followed
by
another
brightacidic
flavor
which
is
definitely
herbal
but
still
doesnt
taste
specifically
of
parsley
sage
rosemary
or
thyme
the
backbone
of
the
beer
does
have
a
nice
barley
malt
flavor
to
it
but
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
not
at
all
annoying
if
i
had
to
guess
id
say
the
thyme
flavor
comes
across
as
the
hot
variety
rather
than
the
roast
chicken
variety
and
the
rosemary
is
really
tempered
not
at
all
overpowering
as
it
typically
can
be
the
rosemary
beer
flavor
does
actually
remind
me
of
cbcs
weekapaug
gruit
from
a
few
years
back
this
one
ranks
high
on
the
drinkability
meter
although
more
than
a
few
might
cause
some
palate
fatigue
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
one
that
i
am
pleased
to
try
i
will
most
likely
have
this
again
only
to
sample
the
differences
of
each
breweries
batch
not
quite
drinkable
enough
for
a
saison
a
bit
too
many
odd
flavors
d
i
like
herbs
as
much
as
anyone
i
grow
basil
and
oregano
but
the
drinkability
is
not
extremely
high
since
the
herbs
dominate
and
come
off
as
a
bit
domineering
in
this
ale
i
could
see
one
here
or
there
but
not
in
regular
rotation
imo
i
had
an
idea
midway
through
however
went
to
the
fridge
grabbed
some
leftover
chinese
noodle
and
had
some
dinner
with
this
beer
made
it
much
more
enjoyable
to
consume
with
food
a
surprising
enjoyable
brew
once
married
with
other
foodspice
flavors
not
a
saison
if
you
ask
me
but
i
guess
it
has
to
go
in
some
category
drinkability
i
just
could
not
get
over
the
smell
we
have
seven
bottles
left
so
i
am
hoping
to
trade
however
this
is
really
a
great
beer
that
i
will
certainly
try
again
dm
nice
carbonation
early
on
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
were
being
released
from
the
bottom
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
the
6
8
is
hidden
very
well
i
had
no
problem
putting
this
one
down
but
i
dont
know
how
many
i
would
want
to
drink
in
one
night
overall
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
is
average
the
herbs
are
nice
in
small
doses
and
one
to
two
bottles
of
this
would
be
very
welcome
these
flavors
would
get
old
given
a
few
of
these
beers
definitely
a
worthwhile
experience
but
i
would
prefer
a
hennepin
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
this
is
definitely
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
the
herbs
take
center
stage
again
and
the
sage
definitely
becomes
more
apparent
in
the
taste
than
in
the
smell
rosemary
still
dominates
the
citrusy
hops
come
across
brightly
bitter
and
a
light
yeastiness
adds
body
the
overall
feel
is
light
effervescent
and
bright
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
really
enjoyable
with
latin
fare
could
drink
this
all
summer
havent
tried
the
other
two
of
these
yet
so
i
cant
compare
pours
a
beautiful
just
hazy
yellow
orange
color
big
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
off
the
wall
more
bitterness
and
parsley
and
thyme
than
the
stone
one
really
has
a
strong
fresh
herbal
note
to
it
really
inviting
and
def
has
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
than
the
atone
version
the
taste
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
especially
in
this
style
which
is
my
favorite
the
flavors
are
stingy
almost
rubbing
alcohol
like
with
extreme
sourness
to
it
that
leaves
you
wincing
herbs
come
through
but
not
pleasantly
or
buttery
like
the
stone
version
mouthfeel
is
ok
has
an
astringent
dryness
that
is
off
balanced
and
leaves
an
extreme
tangy
aftertaste
drinkability
is
limited
for
me
really
not
impressed
but
a
good
effort
with
all
these
ingredients
bring
it
on
victory
drinkability
is
hurt
for
me
by
the
spice
give
me
more
wet
horse
less
spice
but
just
my
opinion
overall
this
was
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
i
still
feel
the
one
produced
by
victory
was
much
smoother
and
enjoyable
it
had
a
refreshing
quality
that
was
sorely
lacking
in
the
dfh
version
overall
very
happy
with
this
brew
after
all
that
i
heard
about
it
purchased
the
stone
bottling
this
afternoon
as
well
so
well
see
how
it
comparesor
is
different
d
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
and
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
saison
big
and
bold
enough
that
it
paired
well
with
grilled
sockeye
salmon
and
brussel
sprouts
pours
with
a
bllowing
bright
white
cloudy
textured
head
rises
well
above
the
rim
of
my
chalice
slightly
hazed
bright
straw
golden
color
lacing
left
behind
is
fine
and
intricate
nose
is
blasting
with
rosemary
and
thyme
it
smells
like
somebody
just
roasted
some
chicken
sharp
spicy
acidity
with
hints
of
citric
undertones
and
sweet
grassy
layers
as
well
flavor
this
one
is
tasting
nice
a
saisongruit
combo
with
aromaticspiy
herbal
additions
much
more
appealing
than
the
stone
version
i
had
it
was
so
spicy
i
had
a
hard
time
detecting
the
saison
characteristics
this
one
actually
accomplishes
the
balance
that
would
go
nice
with
a
meal
using
these
same
aromatic
herbs
citrus
combo
of
herbslemongrassthyme
bitterness
very
green
and
fresh
tasting
lively
carbonation
on
the
palate
helps
the
flavos
not
fall
flat
eye
opening
appeal
that
brings
out
the
point
that
what
else
could
be
used
to
spice
a
beer
up
instead
of
straight
up
hop
additions
i
like
the
creativity
no
boundary
approach
that
went
into
play
when
formulating
this
saison
style
light
effervescent
carbonation
that
works
nicely
with
the
style
body
is
moderate
very
killer
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
easy
no
problems
consuming
this
fantastic
gruitsaison
cant
wait
to
try
victorys
version
tasty
beer
well
timed
for
the
end
of
summer
definitely
more
enjoyable
than
the
stone
version
victorys
we
shall
see
soon
md
a
lighter
beer
but
full
of
flavor
it
had
a
aftertaste
that
lasted
a
while
but
not
too
bad
wifes
take
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
in
there
id
put
a
chicken
in
that
but
those
spices
subsided
as
dogfish
head
swam
into
this
beer
the
balance
of
the
hops
spices
and
aroma
made
this
beer
easy
to
drink
a
surprising
true
session
beer
even
with
the
spices
md
i
am
sure
i
am
going
to
be
on
low
side
of
ratings
for
this
one
it
does
get
better
as
is
warms
but
i
am
just
not
feeling
it
d
another
solid
offering
from
dfh
not
even
close
to
my
favorite
saison
but
not
bad
at
all
an
enjoyable
beer
surely
not
to
be
missed
o
a
light
refreshing
saison
that
straddles
the
line
between
wine
and
beer
o
overall
very
drinkable
but
not
something
id
rack
back
to
the
store
to
buy
good
not
great
though
it
looked
great
and
smelled
fine
it
tasted
awful
to
me
it
was
like
a
bad
white
wine
my
wife
loved
it
but
this
one
was
really
not
for
me
orefreshing
crisp
beer
that
has
a
balance
of
tartness
from
the
grapes
and
funk
from
the
yeast
both
sweet
and
sour
at
times
probably
the
perfect
sunday
brunch
beer
enjoy
served
in
a
goblet
at
ashleys
westland
two
fingers
of
bubbly
head
sat
atop
a
pale
goldyellow
brew
filled
with
carbonation
head
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
sweet
floral
taste
is
much
the
same
sweet
grape
with
a
dry
sort
of
metallic
undercurrent
pleasant
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
much
like
champagne
happy
i
had
it
would
try
again
viognier
is
my
favorite
white
wine
so
i
had
to
try
this
beer
the
viognier
presents
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
like
the
wine
noble
rot
has
a
dry
finish
and
is
not
overly
sweet
the
saison
fermentation
comes
through
in
the
finish
quite
nicely
whatever
hopping
was
done
does
not
interfere
with
but
only
complements
the
viognier
or
saison
aspects
which
is
exactly
what
the
drinker
should
expect
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
ales
ive
tried
and
it
was
a
nice
deviation
from
the
traditional
saison
im
not
much
of
a
wine
drinker
but
my
wife
is
conversely
she
isnt
much
of
a
beer
drinker
somehow
we
both
came
out
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
this
beer
was
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
im
also
not
a
fan
of
grape
flavors
so
im
biased
in
my
review
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
although
not
extremely
complex
like
most
dfh
brews
it
is
efinitely
worth
a
try
not
many
products
our
there
to
compare
it
with
a
great
saison
for
people
like
me
that
are
saisond
out
its
unique
flavors
to
keep
me
interested
enough
to
buy
it
again
from
tap
at
the
brewery
a
very
interesting
blend
of
ale
and
sparkling
wine
nose
is
overwhelmingly
wine
based
but
predominantly
ale
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
higher
than
normal
carbonation
head
retention
is
not
great
lacing
is
moderate
has
a
sour
fruit
aroma
that
is
almost
sweet
towards
the
end
typical
belgium
yeast
funky
aroma
you
can
taste
a
little
coriander
and
belgium
yeast
more
sour
fruit
ending
in
a
sweeter
grape
taste
almost
tastes
like
a
sweeter
wine
at
the
end
with
a
little
more
of
a
hoppy
aftertaste
good
beer
but
not
the
best
saison
i
have
had
it
is
definitely
different
looks
like
a
white
wine
especially
chardonnay
a
small
head
dissipates
into
a
hint
of
lace
is
the
only
visual
element
that
allows
you
to
identify
it
as
beer
fruity
lemon
like
and
honey
like
aroma
delicious
taste
is
fruity
like
grapes
there
is
a
slightly
dry
white
wine
like
finish
had
it
with
fish
if
you
love
white
wine
this
is
the
beer
for
you
feel
is
low
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
and
refreshing

love
this
one

for

if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
dont

not
my

so
to

tasty
beer
looks

a
reasonably
good
cross
of

champagne
and
belgian

ale
i
would
like
to
try
one
with
a
big
head
and
lacing
like
so
many
reviews
mentioned
but
the
bottle
i
had
wasnt
bad
either
o
not
a
standard
saison
or
farmhouse
by
any
stretch
but
a
delicious
and
clean
rendition
that
makes
for
a
real
surprise
i
picked
this
one
up
on
clearance
and
now
i
wish
id
grabbed
a
couple
more
tastes
like
a
west
african
not
great
but
you
can
understand
the
unique
quality
of
this
beer
you
get
the
white
wine
feel
and
the
belgian
flare
you
also
have
a
slight
sour
aspect
in
this
i
really
was
left
wanting
something
more
but
good

perhaps
my

and
i
like
just
about

these

lend
this

the

pretty

almost

it

more

beer
i
really
like
the
amount
of
carbonation

the
refreshing

is

for
having

there
is
no

strong

drinks
very
much
like
a
carbonated

this
is
a
very
unique
take
on
the

category
makes
for
great
sipping
beer
that
pairs
well
with
lots

something
i
would
drink
every

good
for
a
change
poured
into

a
white

is
perfect
and
smells
perfect
tastes
perfect
and
overall
the
perfect

lover
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
total

drinkability
has
a
little
too
much

for
my
liking
but
not
bad
o
its
good
a
cool
concept
executed
very
well
would
be
a
great
crossover
drink
for
either
wine
or
beer
diehards
rich
golden
hued
ale
with
just
a
trace
of
head
that
covers
half
of
the
top
of
this
beer
excellent
clarity
and
vibrant
carbonation
bubbles
theres
not
much
aroma
here
but
i
get
the
faint
grape
must
that
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
a
lager
yeast
smell
the
taste
delivers
the
strongdry
white
grape
flavor
the
mouth
is
is
moderately
carbonated
and
dry
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
nice
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
a
fruited
saison
the
saison
base
was
nice
and
it
was
recognizable
as
a
saison
and
the
grape
must
wasnt
too
over
powering
and
it
worked
well
with
the
saison
yeast
plus
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
theres
no
way
i
would
guess
this
is
9
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
a
little
refreshing
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
dont
think
i
would
have
a
problem
drinking
a
whole
bottle
by
myself
and
i
think
this
was
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
time
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
way
that
the
grape
must
worked
with
the
saison
base
it
worked
together
much
better
than
i
originally
expected
i
also
liked
the
way
that
the
alcohol
was
hidden
and
the
mouthfeel
were
also
very
noteworthy
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
wish
the
head
and
lacing
were
a
little
more
saison
like
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
not
often
since
its
a
little
pricey
i
think
10
would
be
a
good
price
for
this
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
fruity
saisons
it
falls
nicely
into
that
category
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
im
glad
that
i
bought
a
bottle
to
review
im
not
a
big
wine
fan
so
i
didnt
think
this
beer
would
appeal
to
me
much
but
after
i
had
that
sample
a
little
while
ago
i
released
that
i
was
overlooking
it
for
no
good
reason
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
and
unique
saison
keep
up
the
creative
work
o
this
is
not
a
typical
dfh
it
may
be
offcentered
and
unique
but
it
is
not
funky
like
many
of
their
offerings
the
white
grape
must
is
about
perfectly
balanced
to
the
underlying
beer
easily
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
tasted
yet
incredibly
complex
and
full
of
flavor
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tasted
this
offering
from
dfh
and
it
is
easily
my
favorite
overall
this
was
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
good
definitely
similar
to
a
saison
or
fruity
belgian
ale
this
beer
is
scary
because
you
dont
get
overwhelming
alcohol
just
pungent
fruitiness
will
buy
again
overall
a
very
good
twist
on
a
belgian
saisonfarmhouse
ale
good
belgian
yeast
notes
with
a
great
kick
of
tart
and
funky
grapes
o
this
is
like
a
mild
funky
champagne
i
really
like
it
but
there
a
much
better
saisons
that
have
more
of
everything
just
kinda
turned
up
a
hair
bit
sam
and
company
surprised
me
with
this
one
was
not
expecting
subtlety
i
encountered
with
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
fine
carbonation
not
really
one
that
i
would
seek
again
pours
super
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
that
disappears
immediately
with
faint
lacing
aroma
is
strong
white
grape
juice
malt
and
slight
citrus
taste
supports
nicely
grape
juice
white
wine
malts
citrus
finishes
with
some
light
yeast
medium
body
with
a
long
lingering
aftertaste
very
very
impressive
much
better
than
anticipated
much
less
sweet
than
my
expectations
for
a
digfishhead
beer
the
grape
must
adds
a
lot
and
it
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
best
winelike
beers
dry
and
refreshing
id
definitely
drink
it
again
now
im
just
adding
words
i
would
prefer
if
the
mouthfeel
were
actually
subdued
somewhat
but
aging
this
beer
does
not
have
a
noticeable
effect
on
the
carbonation
at
the
same
time
unwanted
bitterness
is
added
to
the
beer
over
time
as
the
other
pleasant
qualities
of
the
beer
fade
overall
subtlety
isnt
usually
dogfish
heads
specialty
but
this
beer
is
the
exception
the
addition
of
the
grape
must
works
perfectly
with
the
base
beer
without
one
overwhelming
the
other
complex
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
dogfish
and
i
really
hope
sam
and
the
crew
continue
making
this
in
the
future
overall
it
was
still
very
enjoyable
but
it
didnt
meet
the
expectations
i
had
and
the
grape
got
a
bit
too
much
by
the
end
id
drink
it
again
if
i
was
offered
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
i
love
dogfish
head
not
necessarily
because
they
make
amazing
beer
because
a
lot
of
their
beer
isnt
that
great
but
they
constantly
make
new
beers
that
have
taste
that
are
so
different
from
other
beers
i
cant
help
but
try
them
whenever
i
see
a
new
one
i
dont
regularly
buy
the
same
beer
from
them
twice
but
im
always
glad
i
gave
their
beers
a
try
just
to
see
how
else
a
beer
can
taste
i
love
the
creativity
of
dogfish
head
beers
this
is
another
one
that
is
very
worthy
and
should
be
tried
o
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
flavors
and
aromas
of
white
wine
in
this
beer
similar
to
a
sauvignon
blanc
or
a
pinot
grigio
this
is
a
good
beer
to
share
with
someone
that
is
more
of
a
wine
drinker
than
a
beer
drinker
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
not
being
all
that
similar
to
most
of
the
other
beers
on
the
market
i
would
have
this
one
again
overall
an
interesting
experiment
indeed
and
one
of
the
better
dogfish
750ml
offerings
ive
had
in
awhile
also
way
too
easy
to
drink
if
this
was
in
4
packs
of
12oz
bottles
it
could
be
a
dangerous
summer
refresher
tasting
now
and
the
grapes
up
front
and
a
nice
odd
leathery
taste
and
oily
feel
here
yet
bubbly
and
refreshing
but
with
a
tart
lemony
burn
like
a
white
wine
married
to
a
saison
which
makes
sense
given
the
bottle
description
overall
a
dfh
success
and
certainly
the
best
albeit
only
grapecentered
ale
ive
ever
tasted
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
its
pretty
decent
and
the
9
is
masterfully
hidden
at
least
it
promised
a
bit
more
than
it
delivered
though
and
it
ended
up
being
less
exciting
than
i
thought
it
might
be
lower
your
expectations
and
youll
probably
have
a
great
time
with
it
overall
if
you
are
into
the
light
crisp
saisons
this
beer
is
a
definite
must
try
personally
i
walked
into
this
blind
and
was
taken
by
surprise
but
i
appreciate
the
beer
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
trying
to
do
and
i
would
give
it
a
solid
45
cheers
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
beer
thats
also
quite
drinkableits
like
sipping
a
light
version
of
a
pinot
grigio
white
wine
that
isnt
as
fullbodied
or
dry
and
also
hides
its
alcohol
a
lot
better
i
would
definitely
consider
getting
this
again
especially
if
i
was
sharing
it
with
a
friend
that
really
liked
wine
and
was
open
to
trying
something
different
for
a
change
tastes
brisk
and
lightbodied
with
a
definite
grape
and
champagne
vibe
goes
down
easily
with
a
light
effervescence
finishes
with
a
solid
fruit
and
spice
tone
i
get
a
distinctive
winelike
vibe
here
and
this
is
a
superior
hybrid
beer
that
id
easily
enjoy
again
very
good
and
a
unique
experience
this
is
an
interesting
beer
as
far
as
a
beerwine
blend
or
crossover
it
shows
off
both
nicely
the
saison
characteristics
come
through
up
front
with
a
typical
dry
white
wine
finish
because
of
the
lightness
of
the
saison
and
the
intensity
of
the
grapes
this
comes
across
as
more
wine
than
beer
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
this
is
worth
trying
overall
it
makes
me
think
more
of
wineor
more
accuratelysparkling
wine
than
it
does
of
beer
like
a
heavy
champagne
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
this
again
but
i
might
give
it
to
a
wine
drinker
to
help
open
their
mind
to
the
wonders
of
beer
overall
not
bad
but
i
can
only
take
the
grape
juice
flavour
for
so
long
would
be
nice
if
that
was
toned
down
and
the
yeast
ramped
up
looking
forwards
to
this
and
pours
just
like
a
chardonnay
the
lightest
straw
yellow
hue
with
a
wispy
one
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
feint
barnhouse
funk
with
white
grapes
and
sherbetthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
and
the
taste
is
like
hybrid
of
an
ale
a
cider
with
a
wine
and
has
tastes
of
applewhite
grapesa
touch
of
light
bready
maltsa
slight
mustiness
and
finished
bone
dry
and
fruity
just
like
a
fine
wine
and
although
this
aint
for
everyone
i
love
it
and
pushes
the
boundaries
between
beer
and
wine
and
also
shows
the
similarities
in
these
two
arts
one
for
the
wine
lovers
cheers
an
odd
beer
for
sure
like
a
white
wine
and
beer
mixer
it
has
snappiness
upfront
but
develops
into
a
dull
chardonnay
like
finish
i
cant
believe
that
this
is
9abv
it
doesnt
show
at
all
it
was
unique
but
i
didnt
love
it
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
an
extraordinary
experience
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
could
see
pairing
this
with
many
many
different
foods
defineatly
a
one
of
a
kind
experience
overall
when
i
originally
grabbed
this
i
knew
nothing
about
it
let
it
sit
in
and
once
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
i
knew
right
away
to
pour
this
into
a
tulip
i
originally
thought
it
was
a
fruit
beer
looking
at
what
i
red
on
the
label
but
after
taking
a
sniff
i
was
already
going
to
indulge
into
awesomeness
built
for
those
in
love
with
belgian
ales
all
you
need
is
a
glass
salud
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spice
and
slight
grape
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
fruit
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
all
that
special
o
the
nice
farmhouse
flavors
turns
a
bit
more
tart
and
astringent
as
it
opens
but
it
still
has
nice
flavor
and
a
unique
character
2012
bottle
pours
a
clear
bright
goldenyellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
goes
down
quickly
funny
looks
like
coors
light
or
some
other
light
adjunct
lager
not
gonna
let
this
bring
down
the
points
though
because
its
a
lot
prettier
when
you
know
the
beer
is
going
to
be
good
scent
is
pilsnerlike
somewhat
disappointing
will
i
be
taking
back
my
statement
i
just
made
one
sentence
ago
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
grape
skin
and
some
green
grapes
with
some
grain
and
belgian
yeast
nothing
too
intriguing
though
no
longer
excited
to
taste
this
beer
taste
is
quite
a
bit
better
lovely
grape
skin
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
wheat
and
grain
flavors
belgian
yeast
and
a
slightly
tart
finish
not
nearly
as
tart
as
i
was
hoping
for
or
expecting
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
dry
almost
champagnelike
drinkability
is
scaryhigh
overall
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
ridiculous
for
being
9
abv
it
drinks
like
a
light
pilsner
or
adjunct
lager
im
not
saying
it
tastes
exactly
like
those
styles
but
it
definitely
drinks
like
them
except
much
more
dry
overall
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
beer
maybe
it
was
city
beers
decision
to
put
this
beer
as
onsite
consumption
only
when
it
first
came
out
that
made
me
get
my
expectations
so
high
wouldnt
call
this
beer
a
saison
more
like
an
imperial
pilsner
with
fruit
very
solid
enjoyable
beer
just
not
as
sour
or
offset
as
i
was
expecting
from
dfh
overall
great
saison
fusion
a
little
hot
but
it
is
9
and
it
makes
up
for
the
heat
with
good
drinkability
o
so
unique
good
saison
very
drinkable
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
almost
clear
very
pale
yellowamber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
grape
nose
and
flavor
is
tart
grape
dry
finish
called
a
saison
but
really
closer
to
a
wine
flavor
not
cheap
at
14
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
served
from
tap
to
glass
at
first
glance
it
has
a
light
pale
yellow
color
looks
like
a
belgium
style
and
tastes
like
one
too
has
a
nice
white
head
to
it
at
first
but
dissipates
rather
quickly
has
a
belgium
mouthfeel
with
slight
apple
and
tart
finish
you
can
taste
the
wheat
too
great
beer
odone
of
the
only
dfhs
wacky
beers
i
have
like
actually
i
think
its
the
only
large
format
dfh
beer
i
havent
been
pissed
about
after
buying
it
its
cool
especially
if
you
know
about
its
unique
origins
looks
crisp
pours
pale
yellow
could
almost
be
mistaken
for
a
bud
taste
sweet
with
an
overall
boozy
feel
almost
like
a
port
its
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
good
its
foamy
and
creamy
and
really
warms
everything
up
smell
sweet
and
slightly
boozy
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
the
planet
o
feels
too
artificial
for
me
probably
from
excessive
use
of
herbs
also
i
dont
know
if
im
crazy
or
everyone
else
is
but
where
do
you
detect
wine
flavor
i
would
classify
this
as
a
saisonwit
and
a
bad
one
at
that
damn
you
dogfish
head
stop
making
exotic
crappy
beers
and
focus
on
quality
products
already
poured
into
tulip
clear
yellow
with
fizzy
bubbles
looks
like
champagne
fizzy
but
thick
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
visible
carbonation
smells
like
champagne
or
white
wine
combined
with
belgian
yeast
taste
is
like
a
champagne
but
with
the
belgian
yeast
sneaking
in
at
the
end
to
finish
if
it
werent
for
that
you
could
tell
me
this
was
a
sparkling
white
wine
and
id
believe
you
incredibly
drinkable
alcohol
very
hidden
for
9
which
admittedly
would
be
less
than
wine
however
this
would
be
an
excellent
dinner
or
celebration
beer
or
a
great
starter
for
winechampagne
lovers
who
want
to
get
into
beer
but
cant
certainly
poured
more
like
wine
than
beer
as
very
light
clearish
yellow
color
and
intense
carbonation
almost
champagne
like
smell
is
very
vinous
and
grapey

there
have
been
a
lot
of
these
wine
beers
coming
out
recently
and
i
just
cant
really
get
into
them
the
wine
kind
of
overpowers
and
is
just
not
that
good
i
might
try
aging
it
for
a
bit
with
hints
of
wine
in
the
backdrop
the
taste
falls
somewhere
between
a
sour
and
a
white
wine

i
do
know
that
much
of
what
is
acceptable
and
even
encouraged
in
beer
can
ruin
a
wine
this
rather
significant
difference
between
the
two
makes
this
an
unlikely
marriage
i
am
not
sure
why
they
used
vigonier
but
no
complaints
this
is
also
a
bit
of
a
style
blur

certainly
more

every
bottle
of

i
have
tried
seems
a
little
different
this
one
is
more
straightforward
it
has
rewarding
qualities
yet
parts
are
still
challenging
especially
with
the
ashy
finish
as
it
got
a
little
warmer
and
as
i
got
towards
the

enjoyed

it

there
is
a

in

it
has
a
very

there
is
also
a
little

and
belgian
yeast
spice
in
the
aroma
the
tartness
makes
it
very
refreshing
and
combined
with
the

malt
carbonation
and
alcohol
make
it
very
well
put
together
and
enjoyable
even
though
this
comes
in
at
8
alcohol
by
volume
it
is
so
well
balanced
that
you
do
not
notice
it
overall
a
really
interesting
taste
going
on
super
complex
and
lip
smacking
good
more
of
a
fruity
flavour
than
i
was
expecting
and
not
as
much
spice
as
i
would
have
figured
a
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
to
see
its
nuances
o
complex
spiciness
with
no
alcohol
presence
an
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
prost
o
so
good
to
have
a
fantome
like
this
once
again
my
last
few
bottles
tasted
like
a
tire
fire
the
only
area
that
wasnt
totally
on
point
was
a
lack
of
carb
but
in
a
way
it
almost
contributed
even
further
to
the
juiciness
with
a
slicklow

a
lingering
acidity

had

youre
a
fan
of
yeasty
saisons
with
an
enjoyable
balance
of

and
taste
overall
ive
heard
so
many
descriptions
of
the
beer
and
mine
seems
different
than
the
others
interesting
beer
for
sure
othis
beer
is
one
of
the
more
unique
i
have
tasted
there
is
a
lot
going
on
and
no
one
flavor
or
characteristic
comes
through
cleanly
although
some
might
say
it
is
scatterbrained
or
unfocused
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
because
each
sip
seemed
to
uncover
something
new
and
interestingly
no
matter
what
flavor
crept
up
on
my
palate
it
seemed
to
fit
with
the
other
flavors

my
palate

youd

to
be
but
it
still
was
very
delicious
i
will
forever
remember
the
aroma
on
this
beer
its
very
astonishing
and
transcends
the
style
as
a
whole
i
wish
i
could
have
bought
more
from
this
batch
but
i
was
too
afraid
at
the
time
of
any
inconsistencies
regardless
i
will
definitely
make
a

out
there
this
one
makes
me
want
to
drink
everything
fantome
it
is
so
complex
and
different
and
each
time
you
drink
it
there
are
more
surprises
i
would
love
to
culture
this
yeast
strain
for
my
own
brews
at
home
the
classic
fantom
saison
a
bit
of
an
oddity
a
downright
strange
brew
loosely
fitting
what
we
in
the
states
consider
to
be
a
saison
bur
probably
far
more
true
to
the
original
style
than
many
of
these
that
are
more
conventional
hazy
sunny
blonde
to
orange
color
with
some
yeast
sediment
and
over
an
inch
and
a
half
of
lasting
whipped
cream
textured
head
it
smells
sweet
and
fruity
almost
bier
de
garde
style
with
yeast
being
the
main
flavor
agent
a
sweeter
malt
base
and
notes
of
apricots
oranges
apples
and
spices
the
flavor
is
as
herbal
as
it
is
spicy
the
yeast
here
is
just
awesome
its
what
makes
fantom
famous
the
beer
is
pretty
dense
higher
gravity
it
feels
hearty
and
filling
even
though
its
body
isnt
much
past
medium
and
its
carbonation
if
effervescent
and
tickles
the
tongue
notes
of
caramel
and
fresh
baked
cobbler
on
the
finish
again
a
display
of
a
one
of
a
kind
yeast
strain
white
pepper
and

sit
on
the
tongue
after
the
swallow
farmy
beer
funky
and
strange
but
incredibly
appealing
to
me
i
know
people
have
had
issues
with
fan
time
and
consistency
and
quality
but
i
had
absolutely
no
issues
with
this
beer
not
much
to
say
here
i
get
a
ton
of
charred
band
aid
on
the
aroma
and
the
taste
is
even
worse
id
say
borders
on
undrinkable
just
a
huge
smoky
charred
band
aidy
mess
not
recommended
and
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
as
others
with
bad
bottles
have
already
reviewed
i
will
only
say
that
bandaid
and
rubber
band
are
off
smells
that
one
cannot
miss
when
it
exists
in
this
beer
i
was
really
hoping
that
i
got
a
consistent
bottle
hopefully
i
will
have
better
luck
next
time
overall
impression
wow
fantastic
clean
and
crisp
malt
canvas
splashed
with
spice
tartness
funk
sweetness
and
blossoming
herbs
the
restrained
tartness
and
extraordinary
earthy
complexity
reminds
me
of
a
natural
and
wild
asturian
sidra
from
spain
an
extraordinary
beer
overall
though
still
a
real
nice
treat
and
unique
creation
o
really
enjoyable
saison
was
worried
about
reports
of
some
off
bottles
but
this
was
quite
nice
i
had
my
finger
crossed
when
i
opened
this
that
my
bottle
would
be
good
but
it
looks
like
i
may
have
received
a
sub
par
example
not
nearly
as
bad
as
some
but
ill
have
to
try
again
if
you
get
a
good
bottle
then
fantome
is
indeed
as
amazing
as
many
reviews
indicate
exceedingly
good
with
no
weak
points
overall
one
of
the
best
saisons
a
person
could
ever
have
yummy
delicious
and
enjoyable
mouth
follows
the
nose
tart
citrusy
i
dont
want
to
go
overboard
with
the
descriptors
a
ridiculously
complex
and
tasty
saison
i
feel
bad
for
the
people
who
got
bad
bottles
overall
gonna
go
ahead
and
assume
this
is
a
bad
bottle
i
cant
imagine
this
is
what
the
brewer
intended
this
to
taste
like
but
i
can
only
review
it
based
on
whats
in
front
of
me
id
like
to
get
another
chance
to
try
this
but
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
o
excellent
saison
with
unique
yeasty
flavors
o
i
dont
have
enough
experience
to
rate
a
bottle
as
good
or
bad
this
was
very
unique
had
some
great
earthy
notes
and
some
less
then
great
hints
i
did
like
it
but
im
not
blown
away
a
rare
treat
for
me
nonetheless
obviously
i
got
a
bad
bottle
have
you
ever
put
athletic
shoes
in
the
dryer
it
starts
like
that
that
flavor
gently
yields
to
rubber
bands
and
then
charred
bandaids
maybe
a
hint
of
sweaty
gym
socks
its
really
hard
to
pin
down
the
exact
flavors
because
im
so
anxious
to
get
this
monstrosity
out
of
my
mouth
quite
possibly
the
worst
beverage
i
have
ever
had
mindnumbingly
disgusting
this
is
what
i
imagine
prison
wine
must
taste
like
check
that
prison
wine
cant
possibly
be
this
bad
ive
had
infected
beers
before
but
this
is
a
new
level
of
terrible
if
i
were
faced
with
the
choice
between
dieing
of
dehydration
and
drinking
this
i
would
choose
death
without
a
second
thought
o
very
unique
take
on
a
classic
style
the
complexity
of
smokyspicy
and
sweetdry
is
really
invigorating
its
refreshing
and
crisp
seems
to
get
better
as
it
warms
o
i
admit
i
may
have
a
bias
towards
this
because
it
has
been
a
want
of
mine
for
a
while
but
this
is
great
even
if
you
dont
like
saisons
im
begging
you
to
give
this
a
try
it
is
so
harmonized
and
complex
while
remaining
easy
drinking
real
good
stuff
you
can
taste
the
effort
put
into
making
this
like
others
before
me
i
was
stricken
with
a
bad
bottle
not
sure
why
so
many
bad
bottles
are
slipping
through
production
after
the
initial
foaming
head
and
my
excitement
bubbling
too
i
poured
and
tasted
burnt
rubber
i
waited
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
the
taste
would
change
and
it
did
not
shame
as
i
read
it
was
a
great
beer
o
excellent
ive
been
quasisearching
for
this
beer
for
the
better
part
of
two
years
now
and
i
am
glad
to
have
stumbled
upon
it
complex
even
for
a
saison
with
a
wide
range
of
flavors
all
of
which
interact
nicely
with
each
other
i
do
wish
it
was
slightly
more
carbonated
and
wouldnt
explode
everywhere
up
there
with
saison
dupont
and
saisonbrett
as
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
ive
sample
fantomes
saison
in
the
past
and
while
it
was
damn
good
this
beer
just
goes
above
and
beyond
this
is
my
new
favorite
farmhouse
ale
fantome
saison
has
an
incredible
depth
of
flavor
with
a
100
refreshment
factor
delicious
o
so
this
was
very
good
not
a
mindblowing
saison
but
certainly
unique
in
that
fantome
smoke
sort
of
way
only
this
was
just
a
touch
of
smoke
unlike
the
hiver
and
brisebonbons
which
were
both
veritable
smoke
bombs
ive
decided
that
if
i
ever
see
fantome
ontap
anywhere
i
know
probably
wont
ever
happen
ill
buy
again
but
the
bottles
are
just
way
too
hitormiss
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
right
now
not
a
beginners
saison
way
too
funky
but
once
you
get
your
palate
wrapped
around
the
crazy
profile
this
quaffs
easily
and
disappears
fast
happily
drunk
in
cleveland
the
easiest
drinking
ive
ever
come
across
fantastic
a
good
session
beer
but
also
great
enough
to
have
one
to
savor
a
top
saison
o
buyer
be
warned
that
you
have
a
good
chance
of
getting
a
bad
bottle
this
is
the
worst
beverage
i
have
ever
had
i
understand
this
was
a
fluke
but
i
have
read
enough
reviews
that
have
said
the
same
it
had
a
lot
of
promise
when
poured
it
was
a
beautiful
golden
color
however
it
was
an
infected
bottle
smelled
and
tasted
like
liquid
band
aids
i
will
gladly
revise
this
review
whenif
i
ever
drink
a
new
bottle
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
however
as
it
made
me
sick
the
next
day
there
are
millions
of
words
i
want
to
say
about
this
beer
but
sadly
it
has
been
years
since
the
day
i
purchased
and
experienced
this
beer
so
my
memory
is
not
fresh
enough
to
express
the
love
and
enjoyment
i
had
when
i
drank
it
the
one
thing
i
will
never
forget
aside
from
the
knowledge
that
still
to
this
day
it
is
my
favorite
beer
i
have
tried
is
that
is
smelled
and
in
a
weird
way
tasted
like
the
best
dank
in
the
world
maybe
my
particular
bottle
was
unlike
any
other
but
i
had
multiple
people
to
confirm
that
it
was
in
fact
true
this
is
of
course
stretching
the
imagination
because
when
experiencing
any
substance
to
say
it
is
the
best
in
the
world
you
are
just
imagining
what
that
would
be
like
whether
that
is
your
cup
of
tea
or
not
this
beer
will
definitely
be
worth
its
price
and
may
never
be
dethroned
as
my
favorite
beer
underimpressed
with
this
beer
especially
since
its
ranked
in
the
top
250
maybe
something
was
wrong
with
this
batch
either
way
not
worth
the
money
its
still
a
refreshing
beer
but
extremely
different
and
strange
for
a
saison
the
complexity
is
a
huge
plus
whereas
the
sweetness
can
be
good
or
bad
based
on
how
sweet
you
want
your
saisons
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
can
understand
its
reputation
as
i
found
it
to
be
very
unique
enjoyable
but
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
before
i
have
it
again
very
tasty
beer
thats
easy
drinking
and
different
from
other
saisons
with
the
smoky
characteristic
o
outstanding
perfect
for
a
warm
day
like
today
so
much
fruitier
than
what
i
had
thought
it
would
be
easily
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
poured
out
as
a
hazy
orange
golden
color
the
head
is
white
and
loaded
with
big
bubbles
the
retention
is
very
strong
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
is
slightly
funky
with
some
honey
and
grain
sweetness
in
the
mix
possible
corn
aroma
on
the
nose
and
not
much
spice
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
smokey
side
at
first
the
more
you
drink
the
more
sweet
grain
comes
out
with
some
subtle
hints
of
spice
there
is
also
some
hints
of
fruit
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
has
a
heavier
body
than
expected
the
beer
is
also
kind
of
sticky
overall
its
a
very
unique
totally
different
than
most
saisons
out
there
they
say
that
a
good
bottle
of
fantome
is
quite
the
experience
if
thats
the
case
this
is
just
a
decent
bottle
that
being
said
its
definitely
one
that
i
would
revisit
certainly
better
than
any
of
the
other
offerings
ive
had
from
fantome
o
obviously
a
worldclass
beer
stunning
d
this
was
a
good
bottle
and
its
in
the
top
five
or
so
regular
fantômes
ive
had
if
i
could
reliably
count
on
bottles
tasting
like
this
one
id
buy
this
beer
more
often
a
very
good
example
of
a
belgian
farmhouse
ale
with
that
inexplicable
dany
twist
to
it
we
had
no
problem
finishing
this
one
o
still
not
as
bad
as
some
beers
that
i
have
had
i
was
still
able
to
finish
the
bottle
i
guess
i
ate
too
many
bandaids
as
a
kid
if
you
want
to
relive
your
childhood
then
this
is
for
you
o
beyond
expectations
as
usual
its
all
over
the
place
while
still
being
enjoyable
to
drink
some
of
these
bottles
are
ticking
time
bombs
this
one
was
excellent
i
shouldve
bought
more
when
i
saw
them
o
very
nice
saison
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
id
love
to
drink
this
again
hoping
to
pay
this
another
visit
later
on
old
rate
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
hazy
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
bandaids
and
more
bandaids
am
i
at
the
doctors
office
flavor
is
more
bandaid
funk
with
some
hints
of
fruit
and
spice
god
this
is
effing
awful
light
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
i
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
otherwise
i
have
lost
all
faith
in
ratings
medium
body
higher
carbonation
level
bubbly
and
dry
on
the
tongue
ive
always
loved
fantome
and
consistently
recommend
it
to
people
looking
for
new
saisons
or
belgian
ales
to
experiment
with
this
one
was
a
winner
but
i
still
wish
bottle
variation
wasnt
such
an
issue
with
them
o
this
bottle
of
fantome
saison
was
undrinkable
o
i
know
that
a
lot
of
people
have
gotten
bad
bottles
of
this
but
the
bottle
i
had
was
near
perfect
this
is
my
favorite
saison
to
date
i
was
surprised
by
the
8
abv
as
well
as
this
drinks
like
a
smaller
beer
than
it
is
delicious
and
refreshing
highly
recommended
d
ive
been
looking
for
this
saison
for
quite
some
time
its
juicy
and
fruity
and
refreshing
and
quite
thirst
quenching
despite
sitting
by
the
8
fire
gotta
thank
my
boy
bret
for
picking
this
one
up
for
me
it
definitely
did
not
disappoint
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
no
head
the
nose
is
wheaty
honey
sweet
slight
white
grape
metallic
and
funky
the
taste
is
definitely
a
delicious
saison
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
pear
no
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
drinkable
elegant
well
carbonated
and
has
a
lingering
graininess
this
is
damn
worth
trying
and
gives
any
saison
a
run
for
its
money
a
nice
beer
but
that
bandaid
flavor
kind
of
spoils
it
a
bit
for
me
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
and
am
currently
exploring
it
more
i
may
or
may
not
return
to
this
one
as
i
have
already
found
others
i
like
more
o
whoa
super
funky
saison
which
is
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
tough
one
to
rate
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
tart
fruits
up
front
but
i
did
enjoy
the
finish
overall
an
interesting
experiment
but
i
doubt
ive
ever
buy
this
again
note
orginally
reviewed
this
on
12411
had
again
at
monks
in
philly
and
dont
know
how
new
or
old
bottle
is
but
most
of
tasting
notes
i
read
here
match
this
new
review
16
months
later
with
one
difference
and
i
hope
somone
might
know
about
this
special
trait
both
my
wife
and
i
picked
up
very
tart
some
sweet
and
tart
fruits
yeast
and
funk
aplenty
but
here
was
the
one
kicker
that
is
different
and
it
made
the
balance
more
amazing
and
i
enjoyed
the
beer
even
slightly
better
than
before
i
bring
this
up
as
i
dont
know
if
we
had
a
bad
bottle
an
aged
bottle
a
brand
new
bottle
and
they
have
tweaked
the
recipe
since
they
make
it
from
scratch
on
a
yearly
basis
so
ive
heard
but
there
was
a
musty
even
smokiness
to
this
beer
as
in
for
a
second
i
thought
i
had
a
german
smoked
beer
this
taste
is
tucked
in
the
background
and
seemed
to
bring
out
the
tart
and
sourness
and
spices
that
much
more
just
had
to
bring
it
up
still
an
incredble
beer
that
anyone
should
try
if
george
clinton
was
the
funk
master
then
fantome
is
the
funk
master
of
the
beer
world
seriously
every
time
i
have
a
bottle
of
this
it
is
different
huge
amounts
of
funk
meets
a
sour
twist
with
some
weird
mouthfeel
and
hints
of
fantome
madness
whatever
you
are
doing
mr
fantome
keep
it
up
because
this
stuff
is
good
fantome
saison
is
a
wonderful
display
of
creativity
and
individuality
a
seemingly
its
just
crazy
enough
to
work
type
combination
of
flavors
and
aromas
traveling
from
sweet
and
mildly
tart
to
funky
and
bone
dry
for
a
super
unique
and
refreshing
saison
everyone
teased
me
for
getting
such
a
hardon
over
this
beer
but
i
dont
care
i
fucking
loved
it
and
i
dont
care
if
nobody
else
does
bigger
pours
for
me
next
time
o
i
would
do
this
again
and
again
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
to
make
sure
its
definitely
worth
the
wait
o
depite
saisons
not
being
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
o
it
seems
possible
that
this
is
a
weird
batch
but
im
not
getting
very
much
of
the
smoke
ive
heard
about
overall
its
pretty
good
seems
like
a
good
candidate
for
aging
though
as
it
should
probably
back
off
the
alcohol
flavors
a
bit
this
is
good
though
and
ill
have
to
make
an
effort
to
try
the
various
seasonal
offerings
as
well
o
smells
amazing
but
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
it
somehow
i
remember
this
tasting
a
lot
better
last
time
i
had
it
something
with
the
tartness
being
overwhelming
overall
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
and
is
something
i
will
regularly
seek
out
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
wish
this
were
more
available
to
me
complexity
and
flavor
are
all
there
not
as
funky
as
other
saisons
and
pretty
sweet
but
it
all
seems
to
work
together
o
it
isnt
fair
comparing
beers
like
this
and
duponts
saison
to
the
american
attempts
at
the
style
but
all
is
fair
in
love
and
beer
the
only
two
saisons
that
can
come
close
to
this
are
anything
from
dupont
and
hill
farmstead
everything
else
seems
to
be
a
belgian
ipa
or
while
a
good
american
saison
it
doesnt
even
come
close
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
americanstyle
saisons
this
is
phenomenal
topclass
stuff
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
i
could
i
will
most
certainly
drink
this
on
a
summer
day
in
belgium
one
day
soon
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
about
what
to
expect
it
is
certainly
a
treat
had
this
about
a
month
before
the
bottles
best
before
and
was
quite
impressed
with
the
dry
complexity
of
flavours
it
packed
together
quite
well
a
bit
more
sour
and
wild
than
i
anticipated
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
very
very
different
from
the
last
saison
i
had
from
frantome
unfortunately
this
is
not
as
good
not
sure
where
all
the
smokiness
came
from
missing
all
the
light
yeasty
fruity
flavors
lots
more
earthy
did
like
the
pepper
quite
a
bit
mouth
certainty
has
top
notch
quality
8
abv
is
hidden
very
well
i
still
look
forward
to
my
next
fantome
beer
sure
your
never
positive
what
your
going
to
get
yet
all
still
are
very
very
good
would
pair
well
with
fresh
pear
or
a
good
green
apple
perhaps
a
salad
would
suit
it
well
as
well
but
watch
it
with
the
acidic
dressing
light
to
medium
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
fine
carbonation
really
interesting
beer
that
changes
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
initially
more
ester
forward
then
really
brett
heavy
as
it
warmed
o
delicous
this
is
a
really
good
beer
saisons
are
among
my
favorite
styles
this
one
has
so
much
flavor
going
on
its
rediculous
almost
like
two
beers
in
one
o
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
tastiest
most
complex
and
satisfying
beers
ive
had
my
new
favorite
saison
easy
great
balance
of
flavors
with
a
great
aroma
and
refreshing
drinkability
dany
prignon
is
an
fing
genious
im
having
this
on
my
bday
and
could
not
have
had
anything
better
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
curious
about
fantome
without
worry
or
risk
of
getting
a
bad
bottle
great
beer
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
a
must
have
very
nice
beer
not
the
best
saison
ive
had
but
definitely
up
there
in
the
balanced
group
for
the
style
with
no
element
really
standing
out
though
its
definitely
a
shade
towards
the
fruity
side
750ml
pours
a
cloudy
beautiful
neon
light
orange
with
a
fizzy
twofinger
eggshell
white
head
decent
to
little
lacework
aroma
is
complex
caramel
dulce
de
leche
ice
cream
pineapples
green
apples
grains
of
paradise
white
grapes
freshly
squeezed
kumquats
taste
is
almost
all
tart
kumquats
passionfruit
some
prevalent
fruity
tartness
very
refreshing
and
lightbodied
buttery
coating
mouthfeel
very
good
revisited
this
one
with
the
bottle
in
my
fridge
much
better
obviously
there
will
be
inconsistencies
with
a
beer
like
this
but
the
bottle
i
had
was
significantly
better
and
i
easily
polished
off
the
entire
bomber
myself
aroma
was
fresher
lacked
any
smokiness
taste
was
also
much
much
better
fresher
grassier
no
smoke
or
tobacco
vegetal
notes
with
a
crisp
clean
aftertaste
o
i
think
this
may
be
my
favorite
saison
looks
amazing
can
smell
it
all
night
it
tastes
great
and
drinks
like
a
champ
i
wonder
if
the
smokiness
comes
from
the
bricks
would
love
to
visit
this
brewery
and
would
love
to
find
this
on
tap
somewhere
and
drink
all
night
m
its
a
light
medium
the
carbonation
is
very
high
overall
very
drinkable
high
on
flavor
and
a
joy
to
drink
will
try
more
from
this
brewery
for
sure
o
really
enjoyed
this
saison
and
its
the
best
i
have
had
to
date
a
truly
great
saison
among
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
taste
is
so
great
such
a
unique
flavor
of
citrusy
grassy
yeasty
malts
super
dry
but
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
wow
fantome
is
just
superb
o
amazing
beer
easily
one
of
my
favorites
without
a
doubt
overall
im
pleased
by
the
creativity
displayed
here
but
its
far
from
the
best
or
even
the
most
original
saison
ive
had
due
to
the
variations
in
quality
from
batch
to
batch
or
for
that
matter
bottle
to
bottle
it
may
be
an
unreviewable
beer
that
being
said
there
are
better
offerings
from
this
brewery
and
much
better
beers
to
have
at
this
price
point
this
is
an
excellent
saison
really
tasty
refreshing
and
complex
great
sipper
but
also
very
sessionable
perfect
for
the
weather
o
fantastic
aroma
taste
wasnt
amazing
but
still
very
good
notes
i
felt
inspired
so
i
surveyed
my
options
with
the
cheeses
i
had
onhand
and
paired
it
with
robiola
rocchetta
it
was
a
fabulous
marriage
if
charlie
sheen
thinks
hes
winning
at
life
right
now
he
aint
got
shit
on
me
most
importantly
its
worth
the
purchase
price
and
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
a
variety
of
food
in
this
case
it
was
thai
cheers
to
fantome
for
their
flagship
brew
its
one
i
wish
was
more
common
highly
recommended
but
if
youre
reading
this
you
already
know
that
verdict
easily
the
best
saison
ive
encountered
went
perfectly
with
the
nice
sunny
warm
day
delicious
beer
light
straw
gold
color
pale
yellow
very
small
bubbles
didnt
last
long
light
aroma
of
banana
hay
flavor
of
lemon
pear
wheat
funk
caramel
green
apple
overall
very
drinkable
and
tasty
with
no
rough
notes
not
very
sour
or
funky
and
very
minimal
alcohol
notes
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
cloudy
and
bright
sunrise
gold
in
color
with
a
two
finger
very
bright
white
head
the
nose
is
light
funky
and
slightly
fruity
it
has
some
orange
peel
and
lemon
zest
to
it
with
light
spicing
wowzers
the
flavors
are
out
of
this
world
their
are
loads
of
every
citrus
fruit
there
is
plenty
of
orange
peel
tangerine
lemon
zest
lime
zest
and
funky
earthy
yeast
and
a
light
tartness
they
are
soft
and
light
while
still
being
very
flavorful
the
most
magnificent
aspect
may
be
the
body
of
this
beer
ive
never
seen
a
saison
be
so
smooth
before
its
as
soft
and
velvety
as
any
beer
of
this
style
could
be
that
makes
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
not
to
mention
there
isnt
a
hint
of
alcohol
anywhere
near
this
beer
before
having
this
i
really
didnt
understand
how
this
beer
has
been
such
a
staple
of
the
top
100
now
i
know
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
its
always
different
every
time
this
time
it
was
on
the
tart
side
the
liquid
is
a
nice
bright
golden
color
with
some
trace
shades
of
orange
looks
nice
next
to
the
candles
a
good
amount
of
off
white
bubbles
with
minimal
sticking
capabilities
the
nose
on
this
is
straight
fruit
with
some
funky
tones
in
there
as
well
orange
with
lemon
spritz
light
spice
and
the
faintest
of
baked
bread
not
as
crazy
as
some
of
danys
other
offerings
being
billed
as
super
sour
by
the
bartender
this
bottle
had
a
nice
tart
punch
but
not
on
the
verge
of
sour
has
that
berliner
twang
to
it
tastes
include
bright
orange
some
lemon
twang
trace
apple
light
spice
thyme
baked
bread
and
whatever
else
was
thrown
in
here
all
together
a
great
mix
and
a
very
fruity
slightly
sour
saison
feel
is
spritzy
with
a
nice
twang
towards
the
finish
body
is
a
nice
medium
i
could
do
a
bottle
of
this
in
no
time
a
truely
unique
offering
that
is
different
every
time
originally
reviewed
on
06272010
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
and
tart
fruity
aromas
like
apples
lemons
strawberries
honey
and
some
mineralyeast
aromas
taste
is
sour
and
tart
with
a
strong
strawberry
flavor
up
front
with
some
spice
yeast
and
mineral
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
acidic
quality
in
the
mouth
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
saison
with
a
surprisingly
refreshing
set
of
flavors
lively
crisp
carbonation
is
spot
on
goes
down
terribly
easy
almost
sessionable
aside
from
the
well
hidden
abv
and
availability
probably
the
bench
mark
but
a
little
too
middle
of
the
road
for
me
would
be
curious
to
try
an
older
bottle
o
overall
another
wonderful
beer
from
fantome
this
is
my
fourth
fantome
offering
hiver
de
noel
printemps
and
they
were
all
great
if
i
had
to
pick
a
favorite
i
would
probably
go
with
printemps
as
it
had
more
complexity
than
this
one
but
the
regular
fantome
saison
did
not
disappoint
and
as
ive
said
before
the
worst
fantome
offering
is
still
better
than
any
other
saison
i
have
had
cheers
to
dany
prignon
o
i
apparently
got
a
good
batch
this
time
the
regular
fantome
is
actually
more
consistent
than
the
others
quite
pleasant
session
beer
if
i
couldnt
take
a
gueuze
with
me
this
would
be
my
desert
island
beer
o
nice
delicate
flavors
with
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
excellent
beer
that
i
could
drink
everyday
except
for
the
price
and
availability
but
ill
be
sure
to
buy
this
when
i
see
it
o
this
is
excellent
the
alcohol
is
extremely
wellhidden
another

it
will
be
a
long
long
time
before
i
have
another
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
come
across
overall
just
outstanding
a
killer
beer
a
real
treat
to
drink
i
will
be
looking
for
more
whenever
i
can
a
total
winner
o
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
saisons
in
the
world
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
it
just
plain
tastes
great
i
need
to
find
a
few
of
these
for
myself
one
of
these
days
pretty
impressive
stuff
here
i
spent
quite
a
while
smelling
this
stuff
and
loved
every
sip
i
took
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
and
look
forward
too
drinking
it
again
until
then
i
need
to
thank
chickenm
for
sending
me
this
one
light
bodied
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
very
good
here
overall
a
good
saison
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
but
i
know
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
variation
in
fantome
bottles
so
well
see
how
the
next
bottle
turns
out
o
definitely
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
and
i
want
more
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
for
its
feel
and
subtle
flavors
but
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
power
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
o
i
cant
imagine
a
better
tasting
more
refreshing
saison
balanced
refreshing
perfect
ive
had
a
lot
of
different
saisons
since
the
last
original
fantome
has
been
opened
and
now
it
makes
them
seem
terrible
i
would
drink
this
every
day
no
wonder
some
people
in
belgium
are
so
dedicated
to
danys
beers
mvery
light
bodied
and
well
carbed
doesnt
taste
like
the
abv
overall
nice
saison
tons
of
great
flavour
o
i
need
another
bottle
and
cant
wait
to
try
other
offerings
from
one
of
my
new
favorite
breweries
o
pretty
damn
outstanding
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
saison
hard
for
me
to
get
but
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
this
is
a
great
saison
one
that
everyone
should
drink
as
often
as
possible
tan
to
yellow
and
a
bit
hazy
head
was
white
and
about
a
finger
but
didnt
last
long
lacing
was
spotty
smell
is
funky
tartness
and
fruits
light
fruits
like
apples
pears
and
apricots
taste
follows
the
fruity
and
funky
smell
especially
the
fruits
tasty
stuff
a
bit
low
on
carbonation
for
a
saison
body
is
medium
overall
its
quite
a
tasty
brew
a
real
nice
saison
great
beer
definitely
my
favorite
saison
o
wow
exceeded
my
expectations
extremely
drinkable
with
amazing
fruit
flavors
love
the
slight
sourtartness
it
has
will
definitely
grab
this
if
i
see
it
a
beautiful
blend
of
grain
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
tart
citrus
zest
and
funk
almost
a
saisonlambic
or
wild
ale
hybird
world
class
stuff
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
is
into
belgian
beers
or
wild
ales
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
and
whether
it
is
summer
or
the
dead
of
winter
this
saison
is
appealing
and
not
just
that
deliciously
wonderful
fine
carbonation
tends
toward
the
upper
end
of
the
scale
and
the
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
medium
actually
on
the
higher
side
for
the
style
but
hey
thats
what
residual
sugars
from
an
8
beer
will
do
and
im
not
complaining
fantome
just
easily
leapt
into
my
top
10
beers
ever
probably
top
5
this
is
one
of
a
few
that
i
would
buy
by
the
case
if
i
could
truly
a
spectacular
example
of
what
beer
can
be
fantome
is
an
immensely
unique
beer
top
tier
by
any
measure
o
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
are
complex
and
keep
evolving
as
you
move
through
the
bottle
overall
a
very
solid
saison
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
for
sure
going
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
tomorrow
curious
to
see
how
this
ages
this
was
a
fresh
one
d
i
certainly
see
why
this
is
considered
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
saison
there
is
a
great
amount
of
complexity
between
the
fruit
and
a
very
tasty
barny
flavor
that
makes
each
sip
enjoyable
the
dry
finish
makes
each
sip
rather
thirst
quenching
as
well
as
easy
to
pick
up
again
o
i
typically
do
not
seek
out
saisons
but
i
found
this
funky
number
to
be
complex
and
enjoyable
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
overaggressive
at
first
waiting
a
bit
allows
the
carbonation
to
settle
out
and
is
much
more
enjoyable
on
the
palate
overall
mouthfeel
is
fairly
crisp
slightly
smooth
with
the
dissipation
of
the
carbonation
pouring
from
a
cork
and
capped
750ml
bottle
comes
a
straw
golden
super
clear
beer
the
aromatics
of
corn
thyme
and
rosemary
seep
from
the
glass
backed
by
some
higher
alcohol
esters
the
flavor
is
good
but
to
me
is
more
of
a
belgian
triple
than
a
saison
very
little
of
the
barnyard
horsey
wild
character
that
i
like
to
see
in
a
saison
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
medium
body
but
finishes
super
dry
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
but
it
is
not
a
great
example
of
the
saison
style
to
me
many
thanks
to
beenitty
for
this
awesome
surprise
something
i
have
heard
of
for
some
time
now
and
never
been
able
to
enjoy
corked
and
capped
bottle
poured
from
bottle
into
my
jester
king
farmhouse
glass
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
color
some
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
vinegar
and
citrus
lime
the
funk
hits
me
in
the
nose
and
gets
me
excited
here
not
sure
if
the
sour
is
intentional
taste
tight
carbonation
some
tartness
wet
grass
cracked
pepper
lemon
citrus
the
vinegar
is
barely
there
but
its
there
this
is
a
pleasant
light
airy
saison
and
very
different
from
all
others
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
a
very
enjoyable
experience
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
enjoyed
it
overall
and
perhaps
if
my
expectations
were
different
then
i
would
have
been
more
pleased
i
cannot
say
that
i
would
buy
another
bottle
but
one
of
my
friends
told
me
each
bottle
taste
different
at
14
i
am
not
willing
to
take
the
risk
i
enjoyed
trying
this
and
i
can
see
it
has
its
own
greatness
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
the
one
other
fantome
brew
i
had
was
noel
and
i
enjoyed
that
more
o
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
saison
great
balance
and
depth
while
extremely
light
and
whimsical
all
at
once
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
im
not
into
saisons
but
i
really
like
this
one
very
deserving
of
being
the
best
saison
out
there
overall
this
was
one
of
the
premier
saisons
i
have
ever
had
top
three
no
doubt
job
well
done
overall
a
good
first
impression
from
this
brewery
i
have
been
passing
over
their
beers
for
far
too
long
overall
an
absolute
stunner
of
a
beer
i
was
hoping
this
would
have
a
slightly
tarter
characteristic
to
the
taste
thus
the
5
downgrade
im
as
of
yet
undecided
as
to
whether
or
not
i
prefer
this
to
saison
dupont
but
those
two
are
definitely
the
finest
saisons
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
eternally
750
ml
capped
and
corked
bottle
best
before
the
end
of
january
2013
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
it
smells
like
citrus
fruits
hay
earthy
funk
apples
and
some
apricots
it
tastes
like
apples
both
sweet
and
tart
ones
citrus
pears
white
grapes
peppery
spice
and
a
bit
of
funk
and
hay
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
made
the
mistake
of
passing
up
this
beer
in
the
past
so
i
knew
when
i
finally
came
across
it
again
the
other
day
that
i
had
to
buy
it
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew

a
bottle
beer
pours
a
murky
yellow
color
with
a
hint
of
brownand
white
head
honestly
not
a
lot
to
see
hear
the
smell
is
potent
even
just
from
the
bottle
funky
fruity
spicy
hints
of
citrus
and
yeast
complex
and
inviting
yet
completely
light
flavor
follows
the
nose
the
flavor
is
fruit
forward
slightly
acidic
and
tart
with
funky
and
earthy
undertones
delicious
and
screams
rustic
despite
all
the
fruitiness
its
still
has
a
nice
dry
finish
light
bodied
which
works
with
the
flavor
and
the
nose
a
tremendous
beer
and
classic
saison
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
but
would
be
more
palatable
if
the
nose
wasnt
as
offensive
the
mouth
feel
also
could
be
tuned
a
little
tighter
to
make
a
creamier
drink
if
you
like
saisons
this
will
not
disappoint
for
many
months
i
saw
a
number
of
bottles
of
this
on
the
top
shelf
of
one
of
my
local
bottle
shops
one
day
i
just
decided
to
buy
one
then
i
learned
it
was
excellent
now
all
the
fantome
bottles
are
gone
typical
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
not
a
beer
id
reach
for
frequently
due
to
the
tartness
but
id
like
to
try
other
offerings
from
fantôme
and
compare
them
to
this
saison
this
is
seriously
farmhouse
ale
perfection
silky
and
creamy
on
the
palate
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
tartness
funk
and
spice
the
alcohol
is
completely
absent
from
the
flavor
and
feel
incredibly
crafted
i
want
more
drinkability
this
is
an
outstanding
saison
extremely
unique
and
dangerously
drinkable
the
8
is
hidden
completely
by
the
fruitiness
it
is
easily
the
best
saison
i
have
ever
had
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
a
funky
edge
based
on
what
i
had
read
but
i
have
three
more
bottles
from
this
batch
and
will
make
sure
they
spend
a
bit
more
time
in
the
bottle
absolutely
wonderful
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
incredible
beer
at
this
point
i
have
nearly
given
up
on
saisons
as
i
never
seem
to
enjoy
the
ones
i
do
try
but
i
may
just
switch
exclusively
to
fantome
this
quaffs
way
too
easy
for
8
i
am
curious
about
aging
this
beer
will
some
additional
time
let
the
yeast
make
the
character
of
this
beer
even
stronger
overall
real
good
saison
and
very
high
drinkability
overall
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
twenty
one
varieties
of
fantôme
sampled
last
night
highly
recommended
o
phenomenal
saison
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
ive
had
three
bottles
of
this
beer
the
good
one
was
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tasted
the
other
two
were
badly
spoiled
and
were
among
the
worst
ive
ever
had
i
rated
the
good
one
here
im
glad
i
tried
the
fantome
but
for
my
money
ill
take
saison
dupont
because
it
is
less
expensive
and
definitely
more
consistent
o
this
is
an
excellent
saison
and
is
fully
deserving
of
its
reputation
as
a
world
classic
this
should
be
on
everyones
must
try
list
o
i
want
to
buy
a
case
of
this
beer
amazingly
balanced
for
such
a
complex
beer
not
a
typical
saison
but
fantome
is
not
a
typical
brewery
surprise
surprise
this
is
an
amazing
beer
one
of
the
best
of
my
lifetime
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
complex
saison
although
it
is
sweet
up
front
it
dries
quickly
and
has
very
little
aftertaste
i
bought
this
on
the
recommendation
of
chris
from
miorge
mihoublon
who
told
me
that
fantomes
products
can
be
very
inconsistent
but
that
this
batch
was
very
good
thanks
chrisyou
were
right
d
this
is
great
not
as
funky
as
i
expected
but
very
good
pours
a
hazy
yellow
some
nice
white
head
smells
sweet
and
fruity
lots
of
intresting
aromas
very
nice
tastes
sweet
and
fruity
lots
of
light
berries
almost
and
citrus
very
enjoyable
good
solid
mouthfeel
overall
very
enjoyable
roger
definitely
chose
well
with
this
one
odecent
beer
would
have
again
100th
review
and
666
for
the
fantôme
apparently
ooooh
spooky
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
lightly
sour
nice
funk
very
refreshing
overall
one
of
the
best
saisons
around
in
my
book
overall
one
of
the
best
saisons
i
have
ever
had
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
im
generally
a
fan
of
more
clean
saisons
made
stateside
but
this
one
may
have
moved
to
the
top
of
the
list
for
me
a
great
blending
of
flavors
and
the
best
utilization
of
the
sometimes
abstract
funk
flavor
that
ive
had
in
a
beer
wasnt
expecting
the
sourness
but
i
do
enjoy
it
would
have
liked
to
seen
some
more
spices
i
dont
like
the
finish
it
makes
me
think
the
bottle
is
slightly
skunked
dont
know
if
this
is
how
its
supposed
to
be
or
if
its
because
of
the
green
glass
not
bad
but
not
as
great
as
id
heard
o
dany
is
the
frickin
man
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
just
such
an
exceptional
saison
o
wow
what
is
this
this
beer
is
unique
for
sure
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
have
heard
that
each
bottle
can
be
unique
i
will
try
another
for
sure
overall
awesome
saison
great
malts
nice
fruits
and
citrus
hint
of
funk
and
just
enough
booze
esters
and
belgian
malts
to
give
it
a
nice
kick
so
inconsistent
but
consistently
wonderful
saison
fantastic
beer
all
the
way
around
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
impressive
though
do
not
equal
the
drinkability
i
could
easily
go
through
several
pours
in
an
evening
it
is
unfortunate
we
do
not
see
fantome
in
west
michigan
this
would
be
a
regular
purchase
do
hard
to
imagine
a
more
widely
available
saison
with
a
better
flavor
profile
a
real
treat
would
like
to
try
other
fantomes
ive
had
saisons
that
were
crazier
with
more
funk
spices
but
none
that
brought
everything
together
so
well
maybe
its
the
thick
creamy
body
of
fantôme
or
maybe
its
something
else
regardless
im
pretty
sure
this
is
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
pricey
though
at
15
a
pop
itll
prolly
be
one
of
those
once
a
summer
type
of
beers
but
at
least
i
wont
be
let
down
simply
put
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
truly
deserving
of
the
recognition
it
receives
including
my
first
perfect
review
i
cant
wait
to
track
some
more
down
cheers
overall
if
this
isnt
one
of
the
best
saisons
out
there
i
dont
know
what
is
i
was
sure
i
disliked
the
style
before
i
tried
this
beer
its
a
mindaltering
experience
im
just
sad
it
disappears
from
shelves
as
quickly
as
it
does
overall
good
beer
enjoyable
more
funktartness
than
i
was
expecting
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
beer
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
good
bit
of
haze
to
it
the
aroma
is
slightly
funky
and
a
little
spicy
with
a
noticeable
malt
presence
the
flavor
is
less
funky
than
the
smell
but
still
detectable
the
beer
is
light
and
very
well
balanced
with
good
carbonation
overal
one
of
the
better
saisons
i
have
had
to
date
t
lemon
pear
apple
some
fermented
apple
champagne
yeast
and
a
nice
dose
of
funk
a
really
great
saison
not
sure
its
my
favorite
but
its
a
keeper
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
and
my
love
for
it
keeps
growing
one
of
those
beers
i
could
drink
every
day
and
never
get
tired
of
o
impressed
very
much
so
reminds
me
more
of
a
wild
ale
than
a
farmhouse
ale
but
fantastic
nonetheless
the
fruity
tartness
is
a
nice
compliment
to
the
funk
in
the
aroma
and
the
only
complaint
is
the
overall
sweet
nature
can
fatigue
the
palate
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
dont
judge
me
recommended
overall
wonderful
beer
i
loved
everything
about
it
amazing
to
have
such
a
complex
beer
that
is
so
easy
drinking
if
i
could
buy
this
beer
in
sa
it
would
most
certainly
become
my
summer
staple
o
a
delicious
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
or
anytime
of
the
year
really
cheers
o
im
impressed
its
unlike
any
other
saison
ive
tried
to
date
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
says
they
dont
like
saisons
incredible
complex
beer
i
cant
believe
i
waited
as
long
as
i
did
to
try
this
but
this
is
because
the
fantome
labeled
as
biere
artisanale
sur
lie
was
the
classic
saison
overall
just
an
outstanding
beer
worth
every
penny
of
the
16
cant
wait
to
try
the
printemps
thats
in
the
fridge
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
was
made
with
barley
and
not
grapes
it
really
blurs
the
line
between
beer
and
wine
like
nothing
else
ive
tried
narrative
lakitu
loved
the
cloud
life
day
in
day
out
tossing
refreshing
spined
monsters
down
upon
the
earth
hey
there
old
lakitu
still
ruining
peoples
shit
lakitu
gave
a
knowing
nod
and
proceeded
to
throw
a
spiked
beast
from
300
feet
shattering
the
small
dry
cleaning
business
below
some
would
say
hey
lakitu
why
not
just
be
a
refreshing
cloud
you
know
water
the
crops
and
all
maybe
for
a
standard
refreshing
cloud
but
lakitu
was
born
with
bite
his
acidic
temperament
fueled
his
anger
and
made
it
rain
not
unlike
yung
dro
in
an
atlanta
strip
club
notwithstanding
instead
of
dollars
it
was
hateful
monsters
showered
upon
the
masses
below
life
could
be
worse
you
could
be
an
asshole
like
that
bullet
bill
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
it
has
a
very
slick
almost
creamy
feel
that
coats
the
mouth
with
what
i
suspect
is
suspended
yeast
it
coats
the
mouth
yet
finishes
tart
the
carbonation
is
a
very
strange
experience
in
this
brew
while
it
looks
to
be
low
to
modest
at
best
it
is
very
prickly
and
lively
on
the
tongue
maybe
just
a
bit
over
the
top
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
hidden
in
this
brew
i
cant
believe
it
is
8
this
is
an
absolutely
outstanding
brew
if
the
carbonation
was
turned
down
just
a
notch
it
could
be
better
asis
this
is
a
must
try
outstanding
overall
just
a
joy
to
drink
complex
and
very
refreshing
i
dont
know
that
i
can
compare
this
one
to
anything
else
ive
had
ill
definitely
search
this
one
out
again
in
the
future
o
overall
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
finest
saisons
nice
developed
funk
and
very
well
hidden
abv
overall
my
favorite
saison
to
date
definitely
deserving
of
its
spot
as
a
classic
a
definite
must
try
for
everyone
unique
and
wonderful
light
mouthfeel
that
is
very
drinkable
excellent
offering
and
glad
this
was
my
first
fantome
looking
forward
to
many
more
fantome
saison
pours
a
mildly
hazy
lemon
yellow
the
foamy
white
head
comes
up
to
about
2
5
fingers
in
height
before
slowly
falling
off
substandard
lacing
very
spotty
is
the
only
thing
keeping
the
beer
from
looking
great
the
nose
is
pretty
good
a
funky
brett
note
that
only
intensifies
as
the
beer
warms
and
some
earthy
lightly
spicy
hop
notes
are
the
main
attraction
with
a
faint
bit
of
light
fruit
also
present
that
fruity
sweetness
is
a
bit
more
prominent
in
the
flavor
and
its
quite
good
it
almost
reminds
me
of
biting
into
some
kind
of
tropical
starburst
the
slightly
musty
brett
note
is
probably
next
up
in
terms
of
relative
potency
and
manages
to
take
over
the
lead
position
as
the
beer
finishes
warming
that
soft
noble
hop
character
from
the
aroma
is
definitely
the
support
player
here
but
adds
a
nice
touch
to
the
beer
the
brew
is
surprisingly
drylight
bodied
for
how
solid
that
fruity
base
is
the
mark
of
a
truly
great
belgian
beer
the
carbonation
is
similarly
excellent
bubbly
and
lively
without
giving
the
impression
of
being
fizzy
ive
seen
fantome
brews
on
shelves
a
couple
times
now
and
passed
them
up
after
having
this
outstanding
beer
though
i
wont
make
that
mistake
again
750
ml
bottle
into
tulip

before
july
2013
excited
i
had
to
get
the
corkscrew
once
again
pours
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
1
5
finger
foamy
white
head
with
decent
retention
that
reduces
to
a
ring
of
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
apples
pears
strawberry
and
spiciness
very
nice
aromas
really
fruity
as
well
taste
of
tons
of
apple
pear
strawberry
lemon
and
spices
finishes
with
some
slight
tartness
and
tons
of
apple
strawberry
and
spice
some
notes
of
fruits
and
spices
on
the
finish
that
linger
for
a
short
period
of
time
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
very
smooth
drinking
as
well
with
no
alcohol
noticed
in
the
taste
or
finish
overall
this
is
just
an
incredible
saison
and
is
also
very
interesting
with
the
fruitiness
but
is
extremely
drinkable
and
delicious
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
clings
to
the
glass
great
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
champagne
and
hay

and
funk
in
the
back

follows
the
nose
and
more
fruity
tropical
fruits
with
grapes
nice
spicy
notes
not
as
funky
or
sour
as
expected
alcohol
is
not
apparent
smooth
and
refreshing
amazing
saison
notes
very
nicely
rounded
and
memorable
the
apple
edge
is
a
bit
assertive
and
surprising
but
in
a
rather
stimulating
way
o
something
that
is
approachable
for
many
types
of
people
especially
wine
connoisseurs
overall
impression
now
i
know
what
people
are
talking
about
with
this
saison
perfect
very
great
example
of
this
style
while
having
a
great
drinkability
behind
it
will
be
trying
more
from
this
brewery
soon
m
holy
carbonation
batman
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
the
carbonation
really
bites
your
tongue
starting
out
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
refreshing
as
well
as
easy
drinking
the
carbonation
really
helps
to
move
the
flavors
through
their
stages
while
allowing
them
to
last
for
appropriate
amounts
of
time
hazy
straw
beer
with
a
white
head
that
left
behind
some
chicken
scratch
lacing
smells
of
some
hay
and
funky
notes
not
particularly
sweet
but
nice
and
dry
taste
is
on
par
with
the
nose
and
very
good
if
is
medium
bodied
with
bubbles
and
a
dry
finish
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
buy
more
bottles
as
i
find
them
very
enjoyable
saison
the
best
from
fantome
that
i
have
had
so
far
o
this
is
an
excellently
crafted
beer
and
a
very
good
pick
by
me
on
a
hot
humid
night
i
definitely
recommend
this
to
any
fans
of
belgian
beers
and
would
love
to
treat
myself
to
another
bottle
soon
id
like
to
get
a
bottle
with
some
more
carbonation
next
time
though
dany
prignon
is
a
genius
the
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
were
excellent
the
best
part
of
the
beer
by
far
overall
i
didnt
love
it
its
kind
of
a
mess
not
something
id
revisit
especially
at
the
price
point
o
very
light
and
refreshing
yet
packed
with
diverse
fruity
and
funky
flavors
great
and
unique
saison
overall
maybe
i
need
to
let
this
beer
rest
longer
this
was
once
my
favorite
saison
andor
farmhouse
now
its
coming
in
still
in
top
10
poured
from
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
color
with
a
big
vanishing
white
head
aroma
consists
of
light
sourness
and
balance
between
malt
yeast
and
hops
notes
of
flowers
grass
citrus
with
hints
of
pepper
too
the
flavor
has
the
same
balance
and
acidity
of
the
aroma
and
a
very
pronounced
fruitiness
citiric
and
tropical
fruits
and
grass
flowers
hops
and
some
peppery
spiciness
medium
body
decent
carbonation
very
dry
long
finish
with
medium
bitterness
nice
complexity
and
decent
drinkability
i
kind
of
expected
more
out
of
this
well
embraced
beer
a
little
bit
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
but
does
not
finish
as
quite
dry
as
i
would
have
expected
overall
this
beer
has
instantly
become
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
i
know
understand
why
it
is
ranked
as
the
1
saison
on
this
site
i
see
myself
drinking
this
one
as
much
as
possible
this
summer
o
unparalleled
complexity
and
taste
in
the
saison
market
i
would
not
try
this
again
especially
at
the
price
i
expected
much
more
given
all
the
hoopla
around
this
beer
quite
dry
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
long
fruity
finish
although
i
am
sure
that
my
bottle
wasnt
properly
conditioned
given
the
poor
appearance
and
even
then
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
its
style
i
would
buy
much
more
of
it
if
a
it
was
cheaper
than
almost
15bottle
b
didnt
come
in
green
bottles
and
c
fantôme
was
known
for
putting
out
a
consistent
product
do
a
great
springsummer
beer
that
is
quaffable
for
an
8er
this
one
makes
me
want
to
try
the
seasonal
varieties
and
see
where
they
can
go
ive
only
seen
the
winter
version
in
my
area
but
i
might
just
try
to
seek
out
the
other
3
as
well
o
very
interesting
and
very
drinkable
its
really
surprising
to
me
that
i
liked
this
but
i
would
happily
drink
another
dry
very
yeasty
with
high
carbonation
this
bottle
was
enough
to
wake
me
up
to
the
world
of
fantome
and
i
am
now
curious
to
sample
more
o
complex
and
delicious
tastes
like
a
lambicsaison
hybrid
i
think
the
flavor
was
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
after
how
amazing
and
funky
the
aroma
was
but
i
still
liked
my
first
fantome
beer
quite
a
bit
i
know
that
this
brewery
is
known
for
their
spices
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
less
of
a
spiced
taste
so
that
fantastic
yeast
profile
could
shine
opens
with
a
loud
cork
pop
and
an
immediate
blast
of
farmhouse
yeast
aroma
pours
a
lovely
straworange
color
good
clarity
1finger
white
head
which
recedes
quickly
yeasty
aroma
reveals
some
lemon
tropical
fruit
spice
and
floral
notes
taste
is
floral
herbal
a
balance
of
mild
sweetness
and
sourness
lively
mouthfeel
lingers
but
without
any
heaviness
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
both
sweet
and
dry
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
high
drinkability
my
first
saison
ale
great
surprise
strongly
recommend
exquisite
a
feast
for
the
senses
yet
at
the
same
time
crisp
refeshing
and
approachable
this
is
a
delightful
sour
saison
with
clean
lemony
sour
notes
and
is
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
drinkability
exceptionally
drinkable
and
easy
to
drink
perfectly
enjoyed
either
as
gulping
or
sipping
a
good
apple
zing
to
it
o
very
enjoyable
beer
and
goes
down
quickly
not
overly
funky
as
some
saisons
are
though
i
realize
thats
a
desirable
characteristic
to
some
the
8
was
hardly
noticable
and
i
would
be
able
to
have
this
brew
through
out
the
night
d
yeah
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
saisons
out
there
its
simply
spectacular
and
deserves
every
bit
of
recognition
simply
put
see
this
bottle
in
store
buy
immediately
d
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
easy
to
drink
i
might
even
say
this
one
is
a
slow
drinker
but
still
very
solid
im
impressed
with
this
one
drinkability
an
exceptional
saison
perhaps
the
best
ive
had
this
was
a
gift
from
a
friend
and
what
a
gift
it
was
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
many
layers
that
express
themselves
differently
as
the
beer
progresses
despite
its
relatively
high
abv
it
drinks
very
easily
making
it
enjoyable
and
complex
at
the
same
time
never
pass
this
one
up
is
almost
perfectly
carbonated
there
is
no
bitterness
to
this
and
its
pretty
much
tart
once
you
get
past
the
first
drink
things
tend
to
get
better
it
drinks
better
and
better
with
each
sip
i
believe
this
drinks
more
like
a
tripel
rather
then
a
saison
though
this
has
a
great
deal
of
strawberry
flavor
it
is
mighty
nice
i
liked
this
beer
very
much
a
nice
looking
beer
with
a
great
big
head
smell
is
lightly
funky
and
a
little
unforgivably
skunky
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
sharply
bitter
with
just
a
little
funk
the
beer
has
a
mouth
feel
very
similar
to
champagne
ive
got
a
feeling
from
the
aroma
that
i
might
have
been
drinking
a
mishandled
bottle
getting
a
better
is
on
my
long
list
of
beery
things
to
do
d
delicious
enough
funkiness
to
set
it
apart
from
a
lot
of
other
saisons
but
dry
and
fruity
enough
to
be
refreshing
d
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
despite
the
large
format
drinkability
is
outstanding
for
a
beer
of
such
high
alcohol
content
drinks
a
bit
slower
because
of
the
tartness
so
the
8
abv
doesnt
really
catch
up
crisp
refreshing
and
very
enjoyable
d
great
all
around
nicely
balanced
with
the
flavors
and
the
modest
funkiness
this
is
the
best
saison
i
have
had
thanks
to
glazeman
for
this
one
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
appearance
and
smell
are
just
okay
but
the
funkiness
of
the
taste
makes
this
beer
the
best
in
its
style
nice
mouthfeel
with
outstanding
drinkability
i
was
shocked
that
this
beer
is
8
very
nice
d
the
balance
in
this
beer
and
its
modest
carbonation
for
the
style
give
it
sky
high
drinkability
for
an
8
beer
this
is
crisp
clean
and
doesnt
make
you
feel
as
if
theres
any
etoh
in
it
at
all
d
im
very
sad
that
it
took
me
this
long
to
finally
have
this
one
it
deserves
its
top
spot
among
the
worlds
finest
saisons
spectacular
flavor
and
easy
drinking
i
will
be
picking
up
more
bottles
of
this
for
sure
d
it
can
be
a
drinkable
beer
but
its
characteristics
of
acidity
and
astringence
make
this
beer
more
difficult
to
enjoy
jd
notes
this
is
one
amongst
the
best
saisons
i
have
ever
tasted
fresh
lively
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
amazing
im
glad
i
was
in
the
mood
to
revisit
this
fine
piece
of
art
tonight
bottom
line
i
love
fantome
this
is
perfect
huge
thanks
to
andrewinski1
for
cracking
this
bad
boy
with
me
clear
golden
in
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
sticky
ring
of
lace
initially
i
smelled
a
big
fruity
nose
it
was
the
likes
of
orange
juice
and
pineapple
with
just
a
slight
zing
of
lemon
to
round
it
out
after
a
few
more
whiffs
a
funky
brett
aroma
because
a
bit
more
present
kind
of
a
spicy
flavor
with
a
hint
of
tart
lemon
to
finish
a
bit
less
funky
than
i
had
anticipated
fromt
the
aroma
but
still
rock
solid
the
feel
is
good
light
crisp
and
good
carbonation
cant
ask
for
much
more
easy
drinking
tough
to
complain
about
anthing
for
it
o
in
short
sour
citrusy
dry
super
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
and
in
general
drink
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
probably
couldve
had
another
couple
i
feel
this
was
a
great
way
to
start
nye
although
probably
wouldve
been
better
to
ring
in
2011
with
this
one
drinkability
an
excellent
saison
that
definitely
deserves
its
reputation
this
is
a
brew
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
frequently
and
despite
its
8
abv
it
drinks
more
like
a
summer
refresher
still
the
abv
gives
it
a
slight
warming
quality
that
could
be
good
for
mild
winter
days
or
for
the
autumn
beautiful
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
cannot
recommend
this
enough
if
you
dont
like
saisons
or
if
you
think
you
may
not
like
belgians
give
this
one
a
try
i
guarantee
it
will
change
your
mind
d
this
review
is
about
as
close
as
ive
ever
come
to
narrating
out
a
blow
job
so
yes
its
pretty
drinkable
d
this
beer
is
funky
fruity
flavorful
and
quite
refreshing
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
always
a
favorite
at
my
house
its
originality
certainly
makes
it
drinkable
and
theres
little
to
make
this
beer
stay
in
my
glass
despite
the
often
large
price
tag
simply
put
this
is
a
delicious
and
groundbreaking
belgian
farmhouse
ale
it
is
the
beer
by
which
all
other
saisons
are
measured
d
i
would
gladly
drink
this
all
night
any
night
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
sticky
side
for
my
taste
one
of
the
only
detractions
from
this
beautifully
built
saison
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
as
soon
as
possible

yeasty
although
not
as
deep
as
the
aroma
suggested
medium
bodied
and
prickly
on
the

d
a
quality
example
of
a
belgian
saison
for
sure
but
i
feel
this
really
pales
in
comparison
to
saison
dupont
still
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
so
high

for

is
a

if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
was
my
first
experience
of
the
style
and
sours
in
general
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
search
it
out
again
im
looking
forward
to
tasting
other
sours
and
broadening
my
horizons
a
bit
ive
read
that
others
have
experienced
a
funky
taste
with
this
beer
and
that
it
varies
from
bottle
to
bottle
i
guess
i
was
fortunate
to
have
a
great
bottle
if
you
experience
a
funky
one
i
encourage
you
to
try
another
in
hopes
to
taste
one
such
as
i
did

d
this

ive
had
this
i
heard
theres
a
lot
of
variation
between
batches
but
the
bottle
i
have
is
a
near
perfect
beer
im
going
to
have
to
buy
this
often
and
hope
i
get
more
bottles
like
this
one
really
amazing
in
every

exceptional

mouthfeel
the

isnt
detectable
in
the

allowing
the
drinker
to
focus
on
the
many
flavors
present
super
complex
with
everything
working
together
and
no
faults
quite
hazy
in
the
bottle
with
substantial
sediment
in
the
final
pour
lively
carbonation
sharp
and
prickly
in
the
tongue
a
bit
earthy
with
faint
fruit
notes
a
bit
of
a
letdown
as
the
depth
of
flavor
was
a
bit
shallow
leaving
a
moderately
tart
finish
unbalanced
a
good
beer
but
i
find
myself
less
enamored
than
the
majority
of
reviewers
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
saison
the
aroma
is
good
but
the
flavor
is
fabulous
d
wonderful
beer
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
saisons
ive
had
super
easy
to
drink
and
refreshingly
dry
very
complex
just
drink
it
already
golden
pour
with
a
tall
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
of
lace
the
aroma
is
soft
layers
peach
apple
bread
candi
sugar
banana
clove
pepper
and
lots
of
farmhouse
funk
the
flavor
has
lots
of
light
citrus
zest
and
granny
smith
apples
upfront
with
a
gentle
and
sweet
bready
belgian
ester
laden
middle
it
finishes
with
lots
of
peppery
phenols
and
more
of
that
great
barnyard
funk
creamy
medium
body
with
delicate
champagne
like
carbonation
d
it
drank
really
good
and
has
the
signature
fantome
farmhouse
tart
qualities
i
can
always
admire
and
savor
these
crazy
experimental
beers
as
i
mentioned
i
have
had
some
bad
experiences
with
fantôme
but
this
is
one
they
got
right
taste
is
sharp
and
tart
with
a
good
light
malt
but
the
mouthfeel
is
huge
and
carbonation
thats
super
creamy
and
sharp
it
makes
it
really
tasty
and
easy
drinking
uncorked
a
75ml
bottle
labeled
for
export
to
america
bought
in
early
summer
at
the
excellent
specialty
store
la
cave
du
vénitien
on
rue
de
leglise
sort
of
the
main
drag
in
la
rocheenardenne
belgium
it
opened
with
a
gentle
pop
and
a
gust
of
strawberries
honey
peach
pear
and
grass
aromas
even
before
i
could
pour
into
a
tulip
glass
a
head
of
light
bubbles
formed
and
dissipated
just
as
rapidly
settling
into
just
a
scrim
over
the
cloudy
brass
deceptively
viscouslooking
i
was
wrongits
turned
out
very
clean
in
the
mouth
brew
the
flavor
is
of
some
dessert
made
with
lots
of
yellow
fruits
and
lightly
caramelized
brown
sugar
with
a
bit
of
coriander
or
some
such
herb
poking
through
theres
a
wonderfully
quenching
and
drying
sourness
to
balance
all
that
sweet
and
help
the
drinkability
my
first
fantome
ive
ever
purchased
pours
a
very
murky
goldenorange
color
with
a
couple
little
speckles
floating
around
medium
white
head
that
diminishes
rather
quickly
scent
is
somewhat
funky
and
sour
lots
of
lemons
and
zesty
aromas
along
with
wild
flowers
and
sweet
citrus
such
a
complex
aroma
smells
sooo
good
taste
has
just
blown
my
mind
initially
i
get
citrusy
tastiness
without
hops
and
some
tasty
lemon
flavors
then
i
get
a
light
taste
with
a
blend
of
delightful
spices
and
delicious
belgian
yeast
finishes
with
a
strong
lemony
tart
flavor
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
beer
has
such
a
great
mouthfeel
for
this
style
nice
full
body
with
a
crisp
bite
at
the
end
drinkability
is
very
high
for
these
warm
summer
nights
i
have
to
say
i
will
for
sure
be
seeking
out
more
beers
from
this
brewery
d
fantastic
brew
from
brasserie
fantôme
and
probably
one
of
the
better
saisons
ive
ever
had
i
actually
prefer
hiver
as
far
as
their
distribution
goes
in
the
us
for
their
more
basic
saisons
the
flavor
is
a
little
bolder
and
cohesive
with
the
same
qualities
as
the
regular
saison
its
funny
though
that
hiver
pretty
much
collects
dust
on
the
shelves
around
here
strong
flavors
of
apricot
orange
rind
mildly
sour
complex
swallow
of
the
above
a
touch
of
sugar
and
light
bitterness
oddly
the
aftertaste
is
very
brief
as
if
this
were
a
dry
beer
the
body
is
thin
compared
to
the
style
but
it
is
also
a
very
smooth
beer
because
of
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
im
noting
a
warming
sensation
in
my
torso
from
the
alcohol
even
though
i
didnt
detect
any
in
the
tasting
this
is
an
excellent
saison
with
the
floral
and
citrus
character
melding
with
the
earthiness
leaving
a
dry
vinous
finish
i
will
buy
and
consume
this
whenever
i
can
whatever
the
price
mouth
feel
is
more
substantial
than
one
would
expect
rather
heavy
mouth
feel
alcohol
is
so
hidden
it
scares
me
this
is
a
really
refreshing
drink
there
is
something
about
this
beer
that
is
really
growing
on
me
a
very
intriguing
drink
to
be
sure
and
very
well
done

enjoy

this

one

i
would
be
pounding
this

my

that
this
a

overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
its
not
cheap
but
if
you
find
it
be
sure
to
try
it
its
an
unusual
combination
that
i
would
describe
as
saison
lambic
and
funky
belgianess
that
youre
sure
to
enjoy
if
they
had
this
at
the
bar
id
buy
one
for
everyone
drinkability
is
very
high
the
flavor
profile
is
spot
on
and
even
with
alcohol
at
8
its
unoticeable
a
great
saison
for
sure
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
bright
white
head
aroma
is

sweet
with
hints
of
lemon

taste
is
of
faint
peach
ginger
with
some
unique

just
the

amount

a
slightly
dry

very
light
flavor
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
but
moderate
abv
is
very
well
hidden
one
bottle
of
this
is
more
than
enough
for
me
damn
good
saison
so
hard
to
call
whether
its
the
finest
on
earth
but
its
certainly
a
hell
of
a
brew
since
i
was
celebrating
anyways
the
14
99usd
price
tag
wasnt
that
annoying
but
its
definitely
not
an
everyday
brew
at
this
price
point
this
is
a
standout
beer
for
style
a
fruity
mildly
sour
delicious
saison
i
was
first
struck
by
the
sweetly
tart
vinous
flavor
of
this
beer
the
tartness
surprised
me
and
it
seems
much
fruitier
than
other
saisons
that
ive
tried
there
are
some
background
saison
characteristics
with
a
very
mild
farmhouse
flavor
ripe
grapefruit
is
also
a
strong
flavor
but
i
have
no
idea
what
its
from
there
are
nice
dry
oak
notes
the
color
of
the
beer
is
very
nice
but
there
is
next
to
no
head
or
lacing
the
feel
is
good
for
the
flavor
but
a
tad
strange
theres
a
good
deal
of
spicing
in
the
beer
some
cinnamon
and
cardamom
the
more
sedimentridden
second
glass
that
i
had
verges
on
a
very
dry
and
wonderful
orange
soda
there
is
a
significant
apple
flavor
that
i
neglected
to
mention
until
now
its
close
to
a
great
apple
cider
in
some
ways
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
fantôme
in
the
future
white
head
that
kills
fast
sporadic
lacing
low
carbonation
this
is
a
different
version
of
the
fantome
saison
that
ive
grown
to
love
and
seek
out
rumor
is
that
the
brewer
changes
the
fruit
brewed
in
out
with
whatever
of
his
choosing
i
have
had
the
brewed
with
spices
variant
so
many
times
before
and
this
one
is
more
of
a
pineapple
version
heavy
pineapple
and
tropical
notes
on
the
nose
hate
to
say
it
but
the
dehydrated
pineapple
is
an
upset
on
this
one
it
isnt
working
i
would
say
the
labeling
on
the
two
is
confusing
and
misleading
stick
with
the
brewed
with
spices
and
stay
clear
of
this
one
pours
a
semi
opaque
yellow
color
with
a
small
whispy
screen
of
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
is
easily
revived
with
a
slightly
aggressive
swirl
tartness
and
light
funk
on
the
nose
notes
of
lemon
grass
and
semisweet
sour
candy
much
is
the
same
with
the
beers
flavor
the
sourness
is
perfectly
placed
atop
a
malty
under
structure
and
a
pleasant
but
diminished
hop
bitterness
though
the
sour
blasts
appear
through
out
the
quaff
it
never
becomes
too
puckering
imo
medium
bodied
lacking
much
of
its
original
carbonation
but
it
makes
for
an
easier
to
drink
beer
absolutely
incredible
fresh
is
good
but
i
think
i
opened
this
bottles
at
one
of
the
perfect
stages
in
its
evolution
overall
either
a
bad
bottle
or
a
major
disappointment
i
hope
bad
bottle
and
will
try
again
but
for
now
have
to
go
with
this
review
as
it
could
just
be
the
normal
flavor
if
this
is
normal
then
one
and
done
for
me
i
love
saisons
but
this
one
is
not
good
at
all
drinkability
highly
drinkable
will
acquire
another
for
the
summer
strangely
thirstquenching
d
very
drinkable
for
8
a
high
abv
saison
but
does
not
taste
like
it
having
had
many
many
beers
of
this
style
this
is
absolutely
one
of
my
favorites
poured
into
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
murkey
darker
orange
with
a
somewhat
small
head
with
little
retention
and
lacing
a
good
amount
of
sediment
as
you
drain
the
glass
admittedly
not
the
best
looking
beer
smell
is
very
unique
some
sweet
candi
ripe
fruit
including
pears
peaches
apples
and
a
bit
of
sourness
to
it
i
can
smell
some
yeast
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
bread
taste
is
superb
a
very
complex
mix
of
ripe
sweet
fruits
yeast
and
some
tartness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
crisp
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
abv
is
hid
very
well
it
was
a
great
drinker
and
i
can
see
having
another
but
not
tonight
clear
golden
color
with
a
soft
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
hay
lemon
must
cantelope
honeydew
and
some
pears
grassy
and
musty
at
the
beginning
but
some
of
the
fruits
mentioned
in
the
aroma
join
in
shortly
thereafter
earthy
and
fruity
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
another
great
saison
from
fantome
easily
the
best
beer
of
the
weekend
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
rocky
white
head
thick
lacing
funky
sweet
aroma
with
candied
fruits
a
wonderful
taste
for
a
saison
lots
of
sweet
oranges
strawberries
and
plums
sour
yeast
balances
out
the
sweet
and
lets
out
the
pepper
and
spice
loved
this
beer
8
avb
no
way
after
the
750ml
bottle
you
just
want
to
pop
another
one
open
i
have
to
admit
i
enjoyed
both
hennepin
and
saison
dupont
even
more
but
this
was
good
i
will
have
it
again
pours
a
hazed
hazed
honeyed
orange
color
dense
creamy
white
head
fades
very
slowly
lots
of
sediment
suspended
in
the
beer
some
sourness
and
funk
on
the
nose
peppery
an
almost
ciderlike
aroma
as
well
lemony
flavors
pretty
tart
overall
light
pepper
taste
maybe
some
applejuicy
pear
in
the
mix
too
theres
a
lot
happening
here
on
the
heavy
end
of
mediumbodied
a
lot
of
lingering
spice
working
overtime
on
the
tongue
cleansing
tiny
little
bubbles
doing
their
thing
this
is
good
stuff
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
wiht
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
a
funky
lemon
orange
and
is
slightly
acidic
the
taste
follows
the
nose
and
is
sour
with
orange
and
a
big
pear
flavor
that
finishes
dry
the
alcohol
is
covered
up
nicely
and
is
barely
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
has
medium
body
and
is
very
refreshing
the
flavors
really
linger
with
this
one
after
giving
my
roomate
a
taste
he
commented
that
he
could
still
taste
the
beer
but
in
a
good
way
i
was
not
crazy
about
this
beer
at
first
but
it
really
grew
on
me
a
must
try
one
of
the
most
interesting
saisons
i
can
recall
having
the
about
of
sweet
lemon
tartness
that
dominated
the
palate
was
intriguing
albeit
a
bit
distracting
the
ghost
on
the
bottle
must
serve
as
a
warning
to
the
mysteries
which
lurk
within
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
just
a
subtle
fruityness
very
clean
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
i
could
easily
see
a
farm
worker
craving
one
of
these
after
a
long
day
in
the
fields
d
its
a
sipper
because
of
its
very
unexpected
tartness
for
a
saison
overall
i
really
liked
it
but
i
would
wait
til
im
in
the
mood
for
a
flanders
or
an
american
wild
before
opening
another
d
it
is
drinkable
but
for
me
the
overpowering
sweet
candi
sugar
note
limited
this
factor
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
honestly
came
away
a
little
disappointed
once
the
higher
abv
kicked
in
it
became
much
easier
to
quaff
d
drinkability
is
one
of
the
areas
where
this
beer
really
shines
it
just
goes
down
so
damn
easy
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
which
is
dangerous
for
an
8
brew
fantome
has
pulled
off
a
very
quaffable
brew
with
the
saison
i
would
have
more
of
this
and
can
easily
recommend
it
overall
not
impressed
pretty
top
notch
brew
different
but
mightily
tasty
a
bit
pricey
but
i
would
surely
buy
this
again
and
again
markedly
complex
original
without
losing
sight
of
traditional
aspects
this
is
one
remarkable
beer
a
vigorous
pour
only
gets
half
an
inch
of
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
skim
in
a
couple
of
minutes
body
is
a
golden
straw
honey
in
color
i
wasnt
expecting
the
nose
to
have
such
a
yeasty
sour
tone
to
it
with
lots
of
fruit
skins
as
you
take
first
sip
you
are
surprised
even
though
the
nose
warned
of
some
tartness
it
is
subtle
and
crisp
a
wonderful
balance
of
bready
yeast
sweet
malt
and
crisp
soured
feel
make
for
a
lovely
combination
this
beer
has
tones
of
green
apple
grape
skin
fruit
nectar
tanins
and
yeasty
breadieness
this
really
defies
the
style
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
crisp
thick
and
doughy
and
calls
for
the
next
sip
alchol
is
completely
hidden
super
drinkable
drinkability
very
nice
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
could
drink
many
fantomes
and
be
quite
happy
if
i
ever
go
to
belgium
this
brewery
will
be
one
of
my
first
stops
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
monstrous
white
head
that
leaves
massive
lacing
aroma
is
of
straw
lemon
rind
myriad
spices
and
grass
flavor
is
tart
lemon
with
white
pepper
dirt
grass
some
tropical
fruit
and
an
even
crackery
malt
base
nice
complexity
smooth
and
clean
on
the
palate
good
carbonation
dry
finish
refreshing
one
of
the
great
classics
of
the
saison
style
saison
straw
color
with
consistent
but
not
aggressive
white
head
delicate
lacy

smell
of
barnyard
funk
banana
straw
and

nice
light

solid
but
not
strong

of
doughiness
light
chamomile
and
honey
malt
then
big
strawberry
light
sweet
and
a
litte
hop
finish
with
herbal
accent
great
beer
a
bottle
of
early
summer
at
its
best
crisp
not
too
meaty
dont
know
about
all
the
time
though
christmas
in
july
delicate
yet
full
body
is
crisp
and
refreshing
really
another
masterpiece
from
fantome
hazy
orange
with
a
gushing
white
head
aroma
is
complex
mix
of
sugary
lemon
yeast
and
flowers
or
something
like
that
maybe
some
bubblegum
im
tasting
some
bitter
herbspice
jive
and
some
yeast
there
is
something
harsh
here
that
im
not
into
very
much
but
i
can
at
least
objectively
identify
it
as
some
appropriately
earthy
acidic
quality
that
some
people
really
go
for
but
then
again
maybe
its
an
apple
jolly
rancher
thing
attached
to
some
bitter
yeast
aroma
was
the
best
thing
for
me
here
im
sensing
the
serious
flavor
quality
here
but
only
objectively
sweeter
than
most
more
spice
and
less
funk
quite
tasty
and
a
very
good
saison
but
this
bottle
at
least
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
rep
as
the
best
pours
a
murky
orangepeach
color
with
a
massive
fizzy
white
head
nose
is
all
belgian
yeast
and
spice
taste
follows
with
great
belgian
yeast
character
apples
pears
peach
light
grape
pepper
awesome
saison
funkiness
wow
mouthfeel
is
slightly
abrasive
as
it
is
extreeemely
carbonated
i
know
saisons
are
carbonated
but
this
thing
is
carbonated
straight
up
to
bejesusville
nice
dry
finish
drinkability
is
quite
good
especially
for
the
8
abv
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
saison
one
i
am
glad
to
have
in
the
cellar
and
one
i
will
certainly
revisit
in
the
future
to
bad
it
costs
15
goddamn
dollars
wtf
thats
like
3
gallons
of
gas
awesome
beer
the
smell
is
dominated
with
wild
hints
of
pear
green
grape
skin
and
pineapple
the
taste
matches
the
smll
with
more
intensity
the
earthy
hay
taste
comes
around
also
the
beer
feels
very
champagne
like
in
the
mouth
with
intense
carbonation
and
dry
light
body
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
pours
a
rich
golden
hue
with
a
vibrant
white
head
that
mousses
to
the
top
of
the
glass
and
then
drapes
the
walls
with
lace
smell
is
full
of
lemon
ripe
pear
green
grapes
loads
of
pine
apple
white
cake
hints
of
tropical
flora
and
earthy
fresh
cut
hay
taste
begins
with
a
mix
of
pear
pine
apple
and
green
apple
and
finishes
with
a
beautiful
array
of
farmhouse
style
hay
green
grapes
pine
apple
and
lemon
mouthfeel
is
very
champagney
magnifique
if
you
like
saisons
you
must
give
this
one
a
try
simply
a
superb
example
of
this
style
beer
yet
a
unique
beer
also
highly
recommended
overall
very
drinkable
without
a
doubt
the
best
and
most
interesting
saison
ive
tried
i
have
heard
stories
that
fantôme
is
hitormissthis
was
definitely
a
hit
pours
cloudy
orange
with
little
to
no
head
the
first
sign
that
this
bottle
might
have
been
a
little
too
old
aroma
is
citrusy
herbal
funky
and
a
nice
finish
of
yeast
flavor
is
salty
and
sour
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
i
guess
this
saison
tends
to
be
more
on
the
sour
end
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
citrusy
with
an
intense
yeast
profile
im
just
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
hazy
dark
golden
with
a
white
head
citrus
spice
and
signature
fantome
funk
in
the
nose
and
taste
lemon
ginger
honey
slight
slight
hint
of
clove
and
maybe
a
hint
of
corriander
and
cardamom
and
a
touch
of
sweety
goodness
absolutely
delicious
wonderful
soft
medium
body
perfect
carbonation
and
long
finish
in
my
top
three
favorite
breweries
of
all
time
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
a
fantastic
beer
great
with
a
meal
involving
pork
loin
a
great
example
of
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
it
saw
this
one
on
the
shelf
of
devinos
an
amazing
surprise
at
a
fairly
irregular
beer
stop
pours
how
a
saison
should
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
nice
and
fluffy
on
top
a
slow
dissolve
down
to
a
thickish
mass
of
head
on
top
nice
nose
is
powerful
huge
citrus
aromas
with
a
ton
of
sourness
in
there
too
although
it
mixes
nicely
with
that
farmhouse
earthy
yeast
flavors
likewise
huge
citrus
yeast
and
sourness
does
a
good
job
of
mixing
the
sourness
with
the
citrus
and
yeast
not
straying
into
the
ubersourness
of
the
bam
biere
or
other
jolly
pumpkin
brews
which
arent
terrible
but
certainly
arent
the
most
complex
of
drinks
really
a
fun
feel
comes
with
the
sticky
sourness
theres
a
touch
of
skunky
graininess
in
the
background
that
keeps
this
one
from
greatness
but
fortunately
it
goes
away
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
delicious
sour
candy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
fun
with
high
carbonation
and
a
fairly
full
body
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
one
that
im
happy
i
tried
an
unique
sourness
to
it
that
melds
nicely
with
the
farmhouse
funk
and
citrus
hints
the
best
saison
in
the
world
that
ive
had
anyway
before
this
i
was
only
just
starting
to
truly
appreciate
this
style
of
beer
but
its
now
official
i
love
saisons
man
this
is
good
there
is
something
new
to
behold
with
each
sniff
and
each
sip
and
its
just
friggin
delicious
i
love
it
when
a
beer
makes
me
lick
the
inside
of
my
mouth
after
each
sip
to
get
whatever
flavor
is
left
lingering
and
this
one
does
that
i
will
be
back
for
sure
drinkability
is
exceptionally
high
given
the
careful
balance
between
flavors
the
sourflunky
taste
cleans
the
palate
well
and
refreshes
to
create
a
new
experience
with
each
sip
absolutely
fantastic
nawt
fnuttin
but
i
expected
a
great
deal
out
of
this
and
can
appreciate
the
workmanship
and
classic
style
involved
but
it
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
at
first
with
warmth
it
definitely
improved
as
the
unexpected
funk
burned
off
and
became
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
fantome
saison
pours
into
my
oversized
wine
goblet
with
a
hazy
orange
gold
color
and
a
just
off
white
head
the
head
fizzles
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
and
leaves
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
fruity
ripe
apples
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
rather
sweet
up
front
with
a
fruity
touch
the
finish
is
slightly
tart
but
certainly
not
inappropriate
for
the
style
what
is
odd
is
the
rather
full
body
cloying
sweetness
and
lower
carbonation
that
the
style
would
normally
dictate
a
bit
of
yeast
spiciness
is
present
and
conveys
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
citric
edge
overall
i
find
fantome
saison
to
be
a
tasty
beer
but
it
rather
misses
the
mark
for
the
style
i
would
prefer
a
more
refreshing
and
dry
beer
with
a
strong
yeast
spiciness
and
lower
sweetness
either
way
give
this
a
try
it
is
a
nice
beer
750ml

grapefruit
orange

notes

well
as

pear
lemon

wonderfully

carbonation
super
tasty
wonderfully
rich
and
complex
yet
light
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
disappeared
well
before
i
thought
it
would
and
id
gladly
have
this
on
hand
at
all
times
d
even
at
eight
percent
this
beer
is
super
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
quaffed
the
bottle
in
no
time
and
if
i
had
another
i
would
have
quaffed
that
too
i
love
this
beer
i
want
more
of
this
type
of
beer
pour
gently
as
some
of
the
bottles
ive
had
have
flecky
sediment
that
can
ruin
the
last
glass
d
wow
i
didnt
think
a
beer
could
be
so
much
like
champagne
this
beer
is
so
much
like
a
dry
champagne
it
is
scary
i
love
saison
beers
this
may
top
any
i
have
tried
overall
very
easy
to
drink
the
best
buy
markers
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
werent
marked
but
im
guessing
this
has
been
around
a
while
wish
i
knew
anyway
good
beer
to
try
highly
recommended
wish
i
could
get
this
for
cheap
if
so
this
would
become
my
tailgate
bbq
everyday
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
complex
yet
simple
bold
yet
timid
everything
you
come
to
expect
from
a
saison
an
assertive
dynamic
beer
that
you
can
drink
either
to
savor
or
to
slurp
this
saison
is
not
as
good
as
saison
deluxe
by
southampton
and
i
am
somewhat
shocked
saying
this
because
southampton
beers
obviously
are
made
by
americans
and
this
is
a
traditional
belgian
style
ale
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
beer
but
its
probably
just
me
as
this
beer
has
an
a
rating
with
over
300
reviews
at
17
dollars
a
bottle
im
not
sure
if
or
when
i
will
be
buying
this
again
the
parts
are
impressive
but
the
sum
ends
up
even
greater
its
pert
and
sassy
clean
and
satisfying
and
it
gets
better
as
the
glass
gets
lower
the
abv
is
moderate
but
no
matter
because
it
drinks
as
smooth
and
easy
as
any
of
the
style
of
tried
and
that
speaks
volumes
because
its
my
favorite
style
its
standard
worldclass
and
an
example
of
topnotch
brewmanship
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mediumlight
on
the
palate
with
delicate
carbonation
and
with
good
amounts
of
it
finish
is
semisweet
and
semidry
at
times
it
feels
dryonce
the
woody
type
of
flavor
comes
around
during
others
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
body
comes
through
and
it
seems
to
finish
a
bit
more
sweet
this
is
a
beer
that
id
gladly
pick
up
just
a
great
saison
the
best
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
warming
pleasantly
warm
from
the
alcohol
d
very
drinkable
8
isnt
extremely
high
but
is
surprising
14
a
bottle
sure
is
a
drawback
but
i
guess
every
once
in
awhile
is
ok
the
best
saison
i
have
had
yet
dwhy
does
this
beer
have
to
be
so
rare
when
i
go
to
belgium
i
am
going
to
hit
this
brewery
up
terrific
beer
get
it
enjoy
it
bought
this
at
south
bay
liquor
thanks
joey
decanted
from
the
bottle
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
twofinger
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
funk
spice
lemon
and
a
candylike
note
smells
great
taste
is
well
matched
with
the
aroma
a
little
funk
at
first
then
plenty
of
lemon
and
candy
with
a
little
herbal
hop
kick
at
the
end
delicious
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
but
smooth
and
refreshing
saisons
are
generally
easy
for
me
to
drink
and
this
one
might
be
on
the
top
of
the
drinkability
list
overall
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
on
a
hot
day
and
is
excellent
in
general
d
pretty
good
glad
i
tried
sadly
wont
really
see
this
much
again
as
its
not
a
locally
available
kinda
beer
pours
a
golden
cloudy
yellow
theres
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
so
pour
gently
white
lacy
head
it
looks
like
summer
to
me
the
aroma
is
fresh
bready
and
citrus
laiden
theres
also
some
apparent
clove
and
spicy
notes
its
pretty
complex
and
very
inviting
many
saisons
can
over
do
the
spice
or
have
too
much
earthy
funk
but
this
thing
just
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
down
the
flavor
starts
off
surprisingly
tart
and
is
warmed
up
with
a
complex
spicy
clove
and
belgian
sweetness
in
the
background
its
very
dry
theres
not
much
if
any
percievable
residual
sugars
so
its
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
one
outstanding
beer
its
a
bit
heavier
on
the
lactic
acid
than
most
saisons
but
it
works
very
well
for
this
beer
outstanding
if
i
could
afford
it
id
add
it
to
my
list
of
regulars
this
is
one
hell
of
a
fine
saison
it
impresses
on
so
many
levels
for
me
the
balance
here
is
what
ill
remember
most
its
flavor
is
nothing
short
of
extravagant
yet
the
vast
array
of
components
play
a
somewhat
modest
role
nothing
is
overpowering
or
comes
across
as
a
dominant
flavor
they
synergize
to
create
a
damn
fine
tasting
saison
this
one
is
certainly
a
cant
miss
d
is
it
drinkable
i
am
pissed
i
only
got
one
bottle
it
is
amazing
worth
a
try
at
least
especially
if
you
like
saisons
a
wonderfully
complex
and
tasty
beer
d
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
highly
recommended
for
almost
any
occasion
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
this
is
not
an
overrated
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
had
very
satisfying
easy
decent
carbonation
bomber
is
enough
for
me
but
i
want
more
will
try
the
xmas
one
first
this
beer
is
immensely
drinkable
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
taste
was
sour
and
left
a
soft
tingling
in
the
top
of
the
mouth
and
tongue
it
was
carbonated
softly
and
was
light
in
the
mouth
overall
a
wonderful
beer
mildly
acidic
lightmoderate
feel
with
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
immensely
drinkable
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
it
goes
down
smooth
yet
crisp
with
a
nice
feel
and
great
flavor
the
abv
is
occasionally
noted
but
overall
very
deceiving
reminiscent
of
a
lightly
fermented
apple
cider
or
fruity
dry
champagne
though
it
certainly
rivals
in
ease
of
consumption
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
tasted
i
dont
know
all
the
adjectives
im
supposed
to
use
but
it
was
a
beautiful
color
with
an
amazing
taste
i
will
be
buried
with
this
beer
i
bought
all
the
bottles
i
could
find
and
hope
to
get
more
soon
the
best
beer
in
the
world
d
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
a
saision
amazing
flavor
and
incredible
balance
but
brought
down
just
a
tiny
bit
by
the
flatness
of
the
mouthfeel
in
the
middle
of
the
750ml
bottle
still
a
must
try
for
any
saison
lover
possibly
one
of
the
best
out
there
today
very
drinkable
made
me
wish
for
summer
will
grab
another
one
for
sure
the
drinkablility
is
limited
in
my
opinion
only
by
the
extreme
deliciousness
found
in
the
flavors
i
never
want
my
bowl
of
crunchberries
to
end
same
sad
tale
with
this
beverage
absolutley
a
wonderful
experience
i
tasted
this
one
after
a
glass
of
saison
dupont
and
it
really
made
me
realize
the
depth
of
flavors
to
be
found
in
a
saison
all
fruits
in
the
harvest
cheers
to
mr
prignon
phenominal
drinkability
this
is
drinkable
but
damnit
if
i
am
not
disappointed
by
this
one
it
could
be
my
bottle
and
i
do
have
a
local
place
i
found
that
carries
it
also
so
maybe
one
day
i
will
try
again
but
i
got
this
from
a
reputable
seller
beverage
warehouse
and
so
that
seems
unlikely
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
whish
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
but
oh
my
god
is
this
thing
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
until
it
eventually
kicked
my
ass
notes
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
it
always
seems
a
bit
different
than
i
remember
it
im
not
sure
if
its
the
beer
itself
constantly
changing
or
if
im
just
experiencing
new
complexities
in
any
case
this
is
an
absolute
classic
of
the
style
and
highly
recommended
worth
trying
at
least
once
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
aqueous
and
carbonation
is
surprisingly
low
this
is
a
good
saison
but
nothing
outstanding
here
drinkability
i
would
only
try
this
again
if
i
knew
it
was
fresher
at
12
00
a
bottle
this
one
was
a
waste
750
ml
green
belgian
bottle
purchased
corked
but
not
caged
from
super
saver
in
edison
pours
a
hazy
misty
cloudy
copper
and
tangerine
hue
with
minimal
frothy
head
that
soon
dissipated
smell
was
replete
with
nectarines
oranges
and
citric
acidity
taste
strongly
complemented
the
aroma
with
spritzy
seltzerlike
floral
essences
some
pear
and
grapefruit
and
noticeable
oranges
crisp
clear
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
modest
level
of
drinkability
despite
the
8
abv
which
struggles
to
make
itself
noticeable
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
particular
offering
from
fantome
which
is
rather
unusual
because
most
of
their
beers
are
topnotch
served
in
my
ommegang
brewery
10th
anniversary
glass
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
could
barely
be
contained
in
the
glass
complex
scent
lemon
belgian
yeast
apples
and
spice
maybe
pepper
when
i
first
opened
the
bottle
my
immediate
impression
was
chardonnay
taste
similar
to
nose
with
the
addition
of
pear
lively
mouthfeel
pleasantly
effervescent
with
a
slightly
tart
but
clean
finish
somewhat
citrusy
excellent
saison
my
first
sampling
from
fantome
leaves
me
wanting
for
more
d
this
goes
down
so
smooth
and
easy
with
nary
a
hint
of
alcohol
an
unsurpassed
saison
from
the
belgian
master
split
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
buddy
extremely
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
thin
head
and
moderate
lacing
looked
a
lot
like
apple
cider
smell
is
an
inyourface
blend
of
spice
and
fruit
fruits
are
both
sweet
and
bitter
its
like
smelling
both
the
fruit
itself
and
the
rind
all
at
once
underneath
it
all
is
the
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
for
authenticity
taste
is
quite
tangy
it
was
a
pleasure
for
my
mouth
but
offered
seering
pain
for
my
chapped
lips
this
is
bad
boy
is
complex
spices
fruit
and
yeast
all
over
the
place
it
seems
there
is
something
for
every
region
of
my
taste
buds
definitely
a
unique
experience
and
definitely
something
to
change
peoples
minds
about
what
a
beer
can
be
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
though
it
fits
well
here
this
is
just
an
allaround
solid
beer
though
my
first
for
the
style
md
extremely
light
extremely
dry
light
carbonation
nearly
no
hint
of
the
8
drinkability
is
excellent
so
smooth
and
so
damn
easy
to
drink
hard
to
believe
that
the
big
companies
seek
out
light
bodied
and
drinkable
lagers
when
this
this
baby
blows
them
all
away
while
still
providing
taste
and
smell
very
nice
beer
d
gets
better
with
every
sip
a
good
solid
saison
notes
this
tastes
every
bit
as
good
as
its
reputation
world
class
d
i
already
subscribe
to
the
believe
that
saisons
are
among
the
most
drinkable
and
refreshing
of
all
belgian
ales
however
i
was
blown
away
at
how
easy
it
was
to
put
this
down
considering
its
high
8
abv
poured
into
a
belgian
snifter
appeared
hazy
gold
with
a
very
nice
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
huge
on
funkiness
very
musty
like
barn
animals
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
belgian
yeast
earthiness
and
funkiness
which
is
still
strong
but
isnt
as
prevalent
as
the
smell
a
good
standard
mouthfeel
smooth
but
the
flavor
of
this
is
just
slightly
overwhelming
for
me
to
want
to
drink
it
a
whole
lot
interesting
saison
though
i
wouldnt
revisit
had
it
for
dinner
with
a
bucket
of
kentucky
fried
chicken
a
surprisingly
good
match
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
saison
style
but
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
few
that
i
have
had
the
hop
presence
really
helps
me
enjoy
this
one
the
carbonation
is
understated
and
it
has
a
light
quality
to
it
very
smooth
with
alcohol
wellhidden
this
is
deceptively
thirstquenching
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
cloudy
gold
a
whopping
frothy
head
that
recedes
steadily
nice
lace
with
small
blobs
that
stick
the
aroma
is
everything
saison
citrus
galore
lemon
and
orange
zest
coriander
and
other
spices
quite
nice
the
taste
follows
suit
a
medium
body
nicely
carbonated
its
juicy
and
fresh
zesty
with
lemons
and
oranges
nicely
tempered
spices
everything
up
till
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
but
once
ya
tip
it
back
its
gold
a
very
solid
saison
pours
a
cloudy
golden
brown
with
a
sizeable
head
nose
is
light
with
an
almost
soap
sud
essence
to
it
but
in
an
organic
way
somewhat
of
a
bitter
edge
to
it
but
overall
it
is
pretty
smooth
and
light
you
get
a
long
term
feel
of
yeast
in
your
mouth
and
a
touch
of
citrus
for
a
whole
though
not
as
long
as
the
yeast
feel
is
as
it
should
be
expected
frothy
and
smooth
pretty
drinkable
though
it
might
not
be
a
session
brew
of
course
i
paired
this
with
spicy
fried
catfish
and
it
worked
nicely
i
would
expect
it
to
go
well
with
any
seafood
dish
beautiful
looking
beer
golden
straw
with
good
clarity
and
a
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
nose
musty
tartness
taste
pale
malt
with
a
twinge
of
dry
tartness
that
is
earthy
woody
and
quite
spicy
some
lime
is
evident
as
well
carbonation
is
spritzy
but
not
biting
on
the
tongue
this
really
drys
out
the
mouth
in
a
good
sort
of
way
drinkability
is
good
and
its
always
a
sad
moment
to
see
an
empty
bottle
of
fantome
crisp
with
moderate
body
and
high
carbonation
characteristic
of
the
style
clean
in
the
finish
with
little
detectable
warmth
very
complex
and
well
done
lots
of
flavor
compounds
to
consider
great
saison
all
around
quite
a
bit
more
funk
than
most
of
the
other
saisons
ive
tried
which
i
like
id
like
to
put
this
next
to
avec
in
a
sidebyside
well
i
normally
dont
buy
fifteendollar
beers
but
the
noel
i
had
several
months
ago
convinced
me
fantome
is
real
as
steel
and
now
its
bottle
poppin
time
this
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
the
head
is
close
to
nonexistent
just
white
wisps
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
glorious
fruits
like
orange
peel
spices
this
is
how
i
expected
ve07
to
smell
and
it
let
me
down
the
taste
is
like
lemon
zest
pepper
with
a
slight
amount
of
tart
funkiness
peeking
from
the
background
excellent
the
aroma
is
absolutely
stunning
hard
for
me
to
succinctly
describe
in
all
its
funkiness
there
were
citrus
and
sour
notes
clashing
it
out
and
some
belgiany
yeasty
ester
aroma
not
unlike
unibroue
as
well
the
flavor
was
likewise
complex
probably
the
dominant
tone
was
sour
like
a
lambic
but
there
were
spices
involved
as
well
and
i
cant
pinpoint
what
they
are
exactly
it
was
just
a
really
nice
mix
of
flavors
spicy
and
hot
and
citrus
and
sour
real
nice
drink
i
would
buy
it
again
without
hesitation
decent
amount
of
hops
in
the
nose
bits
of
grass
and
orange
zest
as
well
some
lemon
and
a
strong
yeast
smell
very
bready
the
taste
is
kind
of
wild
tart
and
in
your
face
with
a
subtle
spicy
side
to
it
its
very
fruity
lemon
peach
strawberry
green
apples
green
grapes
and
a
bit
of
raspberry
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hops
present
yeast
and
a
light
sugar
flavor
all
in
all
incredibly
refreshing
very
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
definite
pucker
punch
and
a
little
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
medium
to
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
d
this
is
a
very
good
saison
with
excellent
complexity
im
sad
that
mine
was
slightly
light
struck
but
it
was
still
delicious
none
the
less
one
that
i
will
definately
purchase
again
as
is
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
warm
day
or
as
a
great
apertif
d
quite
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
750ml
were
gone
very
fast
leaving
me
wanting
more
it
was
very
good
but
i
guess
because
i
already
knew
its
ba
rating
i
was
expecting
too
much
and
was
almost
a
little
disappointed
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thick
head

nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
floral
and
spicy
the
taste
is
also
spicy
and
floral
with
some
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
is
a
flavorful
but
mild
beer
that
has
great
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
light
balanced
brew
hazy
golden
to
peach
color
with
a
finger
and
half
of
rocky
white
head
and
a
fantastic
retention
the
nose
with
its
twangy
funky
yeast
character
also
displays
some
pepper
citrus
floral
alcohol
esters
and
bitter
hop
notes
sour
twang
dominates
the
beginning
with
a
large
yeasty
profile
notes
of
lemon
pith
faint
orange
and
lime
grassy
at
times
and
a
little
bitter
hops
some
malt
sweetness
is
there
but
largely
consumed
by
the
sour
yeasts
becomes
more
vinous
as
it
warms
really
frothy
mouthfeel
that
isnt
thick
but
has
a
good
weight
to
it
the
finish
maintains
the
bittersour
citrus
especially
lime
and
bitter
dryness
d
good
though
i
can
imagine
some
flavor
fatigue
might
begin
to
creep
up
on
me
if
i
tried
to
have
more
than
one
750
still
an
odd
but
drinkable
beer
that
by
no
means
seems
to
conform
to
the
benchmarks
set
by
the
other
saisons
ive
had
for
better
or
worse
depending
on
your
taste
and
possibly
your
mood
hennepin
this
is
not
if
this
is
their
regular
saison
i
must
wonder
what
does
the
strange
ghost
sitting
in
my
fridge
have
in
store
for
me
after
a
loud
pop
this
pours
out
a
beautiful
brass
color
with
tons
of
champagnelike
carbonation
and
a
thick
soft
whipped
egg
white
head
made
up
of
tight
bubbles
the
head
does
not
quit
when
drunk
this
leaves
gigantic
lacing
all
along
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
like
orange
blossom
honey
light
berries
lemon
earthy
funk
sweet
orange
earthy
dirty
hops
and
herbal
hops
that
give
this
almost
a
minty
edge
grain
and
alcohol
are
ever
so
slight
and
merely
act
to
round
this
out
an
acidic
tartness
hits
the
tip
of
the
tongue
initially
and
then
washes
over
the
entire
tongue
while
light
stone
fruits
spicy
yeast
and
sweetbread
become
present
the
funk
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
so
much
as
it
plays
it
relatively
quiet
so
as
to
accompany
the
tartness
remains
fruity
all
the
way
to
the
end
and
on
into
the
aftertaste
as
the
beer
dries
up
and
the
hops
come
into
the
foreground
bringing
flavors
of
perfumey
flowers
mint
and
earth
alcohol
is
subtle
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
very
active
on
the
tongue
this
certainly
does
not
drink
like
an
8
beer
it
is
at
once
refreshing
and
enormously
complex
750ml
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
glass
dates
on
the
label
but
nothing
was
stamped
orange
color
mediumsized
head
it
had
a
great
citrusspice
aroma
it
smelled
like
those
oranges
you
see
at
holidays
with
the
cloves
embedded
in
them
taste
was
the
same
a
little
muted
compared
to
the
aroma
and
pretty
tart
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sourtart
beers
but
i
think
this
beer
is
a
nice
example
of
a
beer
where
the
sourness
balances
the
beer
and
makes
the
beer
not
acidic
but
fresh
poured
into
a
tulip
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
pale
golden
yellow
color
awesome
carbonation
huge
3
finger
plus
creamy
white
head
tons
of
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
green
apples
and
spicy
the
taste
is
maltyyeasty
nice
tangysoury
good
dose
of
spices
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
medium
body
highly
carbonated
drinkable
one
of
the
better
saison
ive
had
to
date
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sweet
pear
up
front
grazing
along
the
tongue
and
palate
with
beautiful
carbonation
and
mild
tartness
that
kisses
you
goodbye
on
the
dry
finish
lovely
beer
get
yourself
one
of
these
d
the
light
body
and
tart
flavor
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
surprisingly
this
beer
complements
bbq
very
nicely
makes
an
excellent
nightcap
on
a
hot
summer
night
peachy
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
leaves
a
tiny
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
peaches
apricots
and
peppers
notes
of
hops
and
sugar
the
taste
is
dry
until
the
very
end
when
it
sweetens
just
a
touch
the
fruit
is
there
along
with
an
alcohol
warmth
and
a
touch
of
malt
very
nice
very
balanced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
again
a
very
balanced
brew
the
drinkability
is
excellent
with
the
touch
of
sweetness
at
the
end
making
you
want
the
next
to
start
the
drysweet
cycle
over
again
the
bottle
is
750ml
and
was
difficult
to
get
i
fear
it
will
be
gone
far
too
soon
my
assessment
dont
fear
the
ghost
d
not
outstanding
but
still
very
nice
quite
different
from
other
saisons
that
ive
had
and
worth
having
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
is
holding
up
quite
nicely
its
slowly
leaving
an
exceptionally
thick
layer
of
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
outstanding
very
bright
and
alive
with
belgian
yeast
and
floral
notes
i
detect
something
resembling
jasmine
and
maybe
a
little
lemon
zest
some
spices
in
there
too
but
their
identity
remains
unknown
to
me
hmm
the
taste
isnt
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
very
good
its
a
little
more
restrained
than
i
was
hoping
for
i
wanted
a
bit
more
sourness
and
funk
in
there
but
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
incredibly
complex
and
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
its
very
light
and
refreshing
honeydew
silky
on
the
tongue
incredibly
smooth
tastes
mildly
sweet
but
finishes
dry
if
that
makes
sense
like
other
belgians
ive
tried
something
in
here
is
reminding
me
of
green
tea
not
sure
why
i
keep
thinking
that
but
its
something
in
the
aftertaste
leaves
my
tongue
feeling
the
same
way
it
does
after
drinking
plain
green
tea
like
its
freshening
my
breath
or
something
anyway
i
am
impressed
with
this
offering
and
will
definitely
be
trying
it
again
in
the
future
in
just
minutes
its
become
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
really
happy
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
and
it
did
not
disappoint
i
got
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
so
there
was
a
ton
of
sediment
in
my
glass
but
other
than
that
the
appearance
was
fine
aroma
is
just
great
floral
funky
and
leather
or
barnyard
aroma
carried
over
into
the
flavour
as
well
all
sorts
of
cool
stuff
going
on
here
and
id
love
to
get
a
bottle
of
my
own
to
ponder
over
very
very
thick
mouthfeel
for
the
style
i
liked
it
but
it
might
almost
be
too
much
when
drinking
a
larger
quantity
who
am
i
kidding
this
was
great
this
has
been
my
favorite
beer
for
some
time
although
ive
only
had
it
on
draught
and
not
in
about
2
years
i
try
as
many
as
fantomes
other
offerings
as
i
can
and
while
some
are
quite
good
none
of
them
touch
the
wildness
of
this
one
which
is
a
shame
how
much
of
that
is
reflection
of
having
only
had
this
on
draught
and
the
others
only
in
bottles
i
dont
know
bottom
line
the
fantome
saison
is
my
vote
for
best
beer
in
the
world
overall
a
hugely
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
i
probably
wont
find
everything
with
this
one
bottle
highly
recommended
pours
with
a
peachy
white
head
a
marmalade
orange
colour
bits
of
sediment
tremendous
spice
in
the
aroma
chamomile
ginger
nutmeg
everything
you
could
find
in
a
christmas
pudding
but
better
summery
aggressive
carbonation
the
yeast
carries
a
wicked
spiciness
to
it
earthy
malty
flavours
a
beautiful
thing
of
a
saison
drinkability
is
great
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
next
step
achieve
dream
of
tasting
fantome
at
the
source
cant
imagine
cruising
the
ardennes
forest
region
on
a
bike
and
stopping
in
for
a
fresh
chalice
of
fantome
d
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
where
is
the
8
you
sure
as
heck
cant
taste
any
of
it
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
a
summer
evening
complex
yet
tasty
and
light
a
very
interesting
beer
and
style
honestly
im
not
sure
the
style
is
my
cup
of
tea
a
little
too
tart
and
sour
for
my
liking
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
a
lot
of
these
more
tart
and
citrus
than
i
remember
from
when
i
first
tried
it
almost
a
year
ago
tasty
and
refreshing
still
trying
to
beat
hiver
and
black
ghost
this
one
gets
close
but
falls
just
a
hair
short
like
most
fantomes
complex
as
hell
an
utterly
fantastic
beer
just
a
near
perfect
saison
the
original
is
still
the
best
in
my
opinion
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
nice
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
with
great
lacing
the
smell
is
a
heavenly
mix
of
apricots
banana
and
bubblegum
perfectly
balanced
and
integrated
more
echoes
of
that
fine
aroma
in
the
flavor
but
a
little
heavier
on
the
aapricot
and
with
some
spritzy
lemon
juice
and
zest
as
well
followed
by
a
little
pleasant
waxiness
and
apple
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
beautifully
creamy
and
tangy
you
want
to
keep
drinking
and
drinking
this
and
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
for
the
style
nearly
perfect
d
this
one
gets
better
with
each
sip
overall
excellent
beer
and
my
favorite
saison
too
expensive
to
drink
constantly
which
is
a
shame
d
overall
i
would
have
to
say
awesome
a
very
unique
and
hard
to
verbalize
brew
so
many
different
ways
this
could
go
very
enjoyable
not
too
heavy
but
not
a
lightweight
by
any
means
this
is
something
that
i
would
definatly
want
to
go
back
and
try
again

would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
at
home
year
round
one
of
my
last
remaining
bottles
oh
well
got
to
drink
it
sometime
cork
did
not
want
to
extract
corkscrew
just
pushed
it
back
into
the
bottle
when
this
happens
with
wine
it
is
not
a
good
sign
using
a
paper
clip
to
hold
the
cork
back
i
got
a
nice
hazy
golden
pour
topped
with
a
huge
foaming
head
smells
of
citrus
and
some
light
funk
hit
the
nose
taste
starts
out
somewhat
tart
and
bitter
but
a
surprising
lemony
sweetness
pulls
through
very
nice
the
tastes
really
play
well
off
one
another
mouthfeel
is
smooth
if
it
were
not
for
that
massive
head
id
think
that
there
was
no
carbonation
at
all
drinkability
is
also
grand
like
most
good
saisons
this
was
gone
in
no
time
at
all
cant
wait
to
restock
seriously
sealed
with
a
crown
cap
and
a
flush
cork
this
green
bomber
yielded
a
pale
straw
colored
beer
that
was
very
cloudy
with
suspended
yeast
the
head
was
two
finger
thick
and
foamy
the
aroma
was
hearty
yeasty
and
rustic
the
taste
was
drier
than
the
middle
of
the
sahara
desert
this
moderately
spiced
farmhouse
ale
was
tart
floral
and
noticeably
bitter
a
little
taste
of
vanilla
followed
by
an
oak
dominated
finish
went
very
well
with
some
spent
grain
bread
from
a
local
brewpub
dipped
in
fleur
de
sel
butter
as
well
as
some
beemster
cheese
i
felt
that
this
saison
was
a
little
less
malty
and
funkier
than
the
standard
bearer
of
the
style
saison
dupont
although
it
does
have
more
abv
nonetheless
this
was
a
hearty
and
refreshing
drink
and
i
found
it
it
be
well
deserving
of
the
accolades
it
has
gotten
d
not
sure
of
the
drinkability
on
this
seems
a
bit
too
unbalanced
almost
like
a
gueze
still
pretty
cool
its
definitely
i
will
revisit
again
bottle
courtesy
of
boboski
poured
d
own
a
slightly
hazy
beige
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
funky
yeast
is
dominating
with
some
belgian
malt
and
some
floralfruity
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
yeast
with
some
sourness
and
brett
like
characteristics
there
is
also
some
sweet
and
floral
note4s
that
provide
much
enjoyment
as
well
as
some
light
spices
taste
is
quite
complex
but
easily
enjoyable
with
a
full
body
and
great
carbonation
d
good
alcohol
slightly
noticable
but
not
detracting
complex
starts
sweet
and
ends
bitterdry
was
expecting
more
earthiness
one
bottle
was
good
for
me
in
a
sitting
but
will
drink
again
one
excellent
saison
recommended
drinkability
very
cleansing
and
tart
a
nice
level
of
sour
with
some
bitterness
and
other
flavors
to
make
a
unique
beverage
thats
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fullbodied
minimal
carbonation
somewhat
slick
in
the
mouth
this
actually
tasted
more
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
rather
than
a
saison
i
really
didnt
experience
any
funkiness
or
spritzy
carbonation
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
beer
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
bone
white
head
that
goes
nowhere
fast
and
leaves
some
incredible
lacing
smell
is
crisp
and
refreshing
like
a
perfect
summer
day
more
specifically
apples
and
clove
dominate
and
in
a
very
nice
manner
i
have
to
admit
that
my
first
sip
was
not
a
good
one
initially
i
thought
this
would
be
a
pain
to
get
through
but
after
a
while
this
grew
on
me
as
any
good
beer
will
totally
refreshing
is
how
i
would
characterize
this
citrusy
appley
and
little
floral
and
malty
wonderfully
complex
and
delicious
this
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
too
bad
its
like
15f
outside
currently
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
but
could
use
a
little
more
to
be
crisper
a
mild
complaint
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
easy
on
the
palate
highly
recommended
overall
i
am
hoping
that
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
because
i
was
extremely
disappointed
were
it
not
for
my
friends
i
would
have
poured
the
rest
of
the
750ml
down
the
drain
d
this
single
bottle
just
seems
worse
i
have
had
it
2
times
before
and
both
times
it
was
great
so
i
think
i
am
going
to
give
the
scoring
to
the
other
ones
i
have
had
since
i
know
its
good
but
this
bottle
just
isnt
d
this
beer
for
sure
lived
up
to
the
hype
very
tasty
brew
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
this
fine
brew
is
actually
rather
bitter
this
is
a
great
very
full
flavored
saison
it
has
mad
complexity
and
a
tonne
of
fruit
flavors
i
recommend
it
d
gets
stupid
sour
as
it
warms
and
the
alcohol
becomes
more
evident
not
my
favorite
saison
so
far
this
is
a
beer
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
best
saison
i
have
had
so
far
i
enjoyed
the
heck
out
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
how
indicative
it
is
of
the
saison
style
whatever
i
dont
care
it
was
really
good
maybe
i
just
need
to
have
some
more
saisons
maybe
i
just
need
to
have
some
more
fantome
definitely
recommended
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
balanced
well
thanks
to
my
friend
and
fellow
ba
hardtarget
for
sharing
this
rare
example
creamy
and
highly
carbonated
refreshing
and
lightbodied
incredibly
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
downing
pint
after
pint
if
i
lived
in
belgium
mouthfeel
is
big
and
creamy
much
more
so
than
expected
a
real
treat
drinkability
is
well
above
average
its
a
beer
you
want
to
sip
and
share
pours
out
hazy
gold
colored
body
big
white
head
slowly
fades
with
lots
of
lacing
smells
sour
and
funky
apples
and
other
fruits
are
up
front
spicy
and
very
nice
the
taste
is
light
crisp
fruity
with
citrus
good
mouthfeel
finishes
heavy
wih
a
little
alcohol
noticible
at
the
end
gosh
i
really
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
had
been
looking
for
fantome
for
a
long
time
and
my
local
beer
store
finally
got
some
im
willing
to
admit
that
it
might
have
been
my
own
taste
buds
that
were
off
perhaps
the
bottle
was
old
or
i
served
it
too
cold
but
i
did
not
enjoy
it
and
in
fact
poured
it
out
to
me
the
beer
was
not
carbonated
enough
which
is
interesting
considering
some
of
the
other
reviews
taste
was
weak
insipid
dull
a
pale
impression
of
other
saisons
that
i
have
had
and
enjoyed
indeed
hennepin
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
may
spring
for
another
bottle
one
of
these
days
but
im
not
impressed
at
all
the
more
bitter
elements
are
dulled
quickly
by
the
palate
and
this
beer
becomes
far
too
easy
to
drink
at
8
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
spicy
for
my
taste
i
gave
my
wife
a
taste
who
doesnt
judge
beer
but
has
a
pretty
good
palate
though
she
wont
admit
it
and
she
said
that
she
got
a
medicinal
impression
i
think
that
this
was
a
misinterpretation
of
the
spices
the
beer
is
really
well
attenuated
and
well
balanced
for
the
attenuation
and
spice
additions
even
after
it
warms
the
strength
is
completely
masked
though
i
think
that
i
may
prefer
saison
dupont
more
at
this
time
until
i
try
them
side
by
side
this
beer
is
still
really
tasty
and
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
drinkability
is
perfect
this
beer
tastes
so
perfectly
balanced
and
delicious
that
i
could
constantly
drink
this
by
far
the
premiere
saison
750
bottle
with
cork
and
cap
gave
a
hearty
pop
when
the
cork
was
pulled
poured
with
high
carbonation
but
almost
no
head
no
lace
fruit
and
spice
notes
in
the
taste
were
subdued
in
the
aroma
aroma
was
more
of
the
sour
lambic
quality
with
almost
no
lambic
taste
in
the
beer
odd
palette
was
active
due
to
high
carbonation
and
quite
complex
for
such
a
light
colored
beer
slight
fruity
after
taste
of
strawberries
and
lemongrass
fantome
saison
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
green
750
ml
bottle
that
has
a
crown
over
a
cork
corkscrew
required
great
citrusy
aroma
with
a
touch
of
funk
taste
also
has
citrusy
notes
lemon
orange
and
some
rind
definitely
a
bit
of
funk
thrown
in
too
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
but
i
catch
a
bit
of
it
now
and
then
excellent
hightly
drinkable
recommended
pale
gold
and
quite
clear
topped
by
a
big
fluffy
bright
white
head
supported
by
ample
carbonation
good
retention
and
a
thick
collar
of
bubbles
that
hug
the
glass
for
about
a
half
inch
above
the
top
of
the
beer
fruity
nose
with
lemon
zest
peaches
grapefruit
pith
almost
a
sweet
tart
combination
theres
also
coriander
and
clove
spiciness
plus
a
hint
of
funk
in
the
yeast
aroma
big
fruitiness
in
the
flavour
too
and
the
acidity
really
brings
this
out
theres
plenty
of
citrus
but
more
like
the
peel
and
pulp
rather
than
juice
as
well
as
a
pleasant
pear
flavour
thats
more
apparent
as
it
warmed
sweetness
is
tamed
by
the
tartness
leaving
a
dry
finish
spices
add
some
depth
around
the
middle
and
linger
along
with
the
citrus
character
yeast
is
masked
as
is
most
of
the
funkiness
but
a
little
bit
of
bread
grass
and
earthiness
peek
through
lively
carbonation
with
a
creamy
texture
this
is
really
tasty
stuff
i
enjoy
the
style
overall
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
saison
the
only
thing
that
impacts
the
drinkability
for
me
is
the
dryness
its
fairly
aggressive
after
a
while
but
still
very
nice
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
sunset
hue
and
a
pillowy
bright
white
head
nose
is
fruity
with
notes
of
lemon
zest
ripe
apples
and
apricots
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
has
several
layers
of
complex
flavor
theres
some
sweet
candied
sugar
some
fruity
notes
of
apple
that
become
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
a
spiciness
of
clove
and
white
pepper
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
yeastiness
all
blended
together
perfectly
a
marvelous
beer
that
i
wish
was
available
locally
over
the
years
i
have
rarely
had
a
fantome
saison
that
came
close
to
the
old
label
vintages
in
the
mid
00s
yesterday
we
shared
a
new
label
batch
and
it
tasted
like
sweet
tea
smoke
and
pears
rolled
in
dirt
probably
would
rate
it
a
3
53
6
very
disjointed
and
nothing
at
all
like
the
old
fantome
around
201011
i
had
one
that
just
tasted
very
plain
and
grainy
with
no
fruit
esters
spice
or
anything
its
always
hit
or
miss
and
lately
its
been
more
in
the
miss
category
unfortunately
semidry
and
lightly
carbonated

almost
champaign
style
no
problem
enjoying
the
750ml
there
is
no
alcohol
in
this
oops
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
8
is
kickin
ass
evil
me
i
even
drank
from
the
bottle
for
a
moment
like
it
was
pbr
at
a
crawfish
boil
i
regained
my
composure
to
admire
the
closing
moments
of
this
fine
saison
i
highly
suggest
this
beer
for
anyone
looking
for
a
true
marker
of
saison
for
me
its
a
very
different
but
enjoyable
brew
that
i
will
definitely
drink
again
note
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
didnt
conform
to
my
expectations
of
a
saison
which
i
suppose
is
the
mold
set
by
dupont
it
was
much
thicker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
when
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
very
dry
crisp
beer
and
this
wasnt
that
just
a
warning
for
others
this
is
more
a
spring
than
summer
beer
dig
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
a
bit
too
light
on
the
hops
and
not
enough
malt
flavor
for
my
liking
but
for
a
saison
it
is
a
very
quality
brew

and
a

barnyard
tasting
it
there
are
more
nuances
everyone
who
tasted
it
noticed
a
buttery
flavor
along
with
this
are
the
grass
and
apple
flavors
although
the
former
is
less
pronounced
than
in
the
nose
this
all
recedes
to
a
nice
sweet
and
sour
malt
taste
pouring
in
all
of
the
yeast
mellows
the
taste
and
makes
it
somewhat
earthier
its
mediumbodied
mouth
coating
with
good
tingly
carbonation
ive
had
a
number
of
fantomes
and
the
variety
in
just
this
style
astounds
me
a
whole
750
is
never
enough
drinkability
what
can
i
say
this
beer
is
executedly
perfectly
balanced
and
delicious
i
must
try
more
from
this
brewery
just
great

i
wish
i
had
a

supply
served
from
a
750

not
sure
what
the
vintage
is
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thick
active
off
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
and
gave
good
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
earthy
and
spicey
the
taste
is
fruity
and
spicey
at
the
same
time
and
a
bit
funky
to
boot
just
what
you
would
expect
from
the
folks
at
fantome
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
carbonated
body
and

highly
highly
highly
recommended

things
out
a
yummy
beer
for
sure
though
i
think
i
enjoyed
saison
dupont
better
next
up
la
chouffe
moinette
and
revisiting
hennepin
only
just
short
of
a
perfect
beer
but
perfect
for
the
style
and
easily
in
my
alltime
pantheon
of
beers
the
more
saisons
i
drink
the
more
i
appreciate
this
beauty
drinkablity
was
ok
we
split
a
750ml
that
was
enough
for
me
intriguing
and
wellbalanced
drinkability
a
very
intriguing
concoction
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
top
notch
not
bad
but
i
think
i
need
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
not
as
dry
as
expected
but
a
classic
saison
nonetheless
d
hugely
drinkable
a
very
tasty
example
of
a
saison
very
tasty
i
thought
the
tartness
took
a
few
sips
to
get
used
to
otherwise
this
is
a
great
well
balanced
belgian
beer
medium
body
who
is
quite
fruity
refreshing
the
hops
come
in
and
tickle
you
with
aromas
of
apple
and
banana
then
the
malt
comes
in
and
surounds
you
with
a
shy
alcohol
warmness
which
ends
up
on
spices
and
very
shy
notes
of
complex
flavors
drinkability
the
wife
and
i
could
have
drank
several
bottles
of
this
full
flavored
and
satisfies
the
tastebuds
a
must
buy
if
you
see
it
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
the
trade
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
one
to
savor
not
just
belt
back
id
love
to
try
pairing
this
with
a
few
different
cheeses
an
absolutely
wonderful
brew
no
date
on
the
cork
or
750ml
bottle
appears
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
tight
eggshell
colored
head
that
leaves
small
dashes
of
lace
around
the
glass
great
funky
nose
is
packed
with
plenty
of
farmy
barn
notes
sweet
fruit
notes
blend
with
spices
and
a
light
hoppiness
awesome
aroma
with
all
the
funk
you
would
expect
from
a
fantome
saison
lightly
sweet
fruit
flavor
with
a
mix
of
funk
and
spiciness
come
on
strong
nice
crisp
bitter
floral
hops
mix
in
well
and
contrast
with
the
slight
tartness
thats
present
pretty
much
everything
i
would
look
for
in
the
flavor
a
perfect
example
in
my
book
smooth
crisp
mouthfeel
that
i
found
refreshing
drinkability
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
for
the
style
a
must
try
for
any
saison
fan
d
not
a
bad
saison
but
for
the
money
there
are
better
options
mouthfeel
pretty
puckery
not
too
say
my
mouth
puckered
whilst
drinking
this
beer
but
it
was
tarter
than
i
expected
almost
cloying
ps
now
when
i
think
saison
i
think
fantôme
so
this
is
my
100th
review
750
ml
corked
and
capped
bottle
with
a
ghost
and
the
default
description
of
their
brewery
on
the
label
if
the
head
which
started
out
big
and
frothy
were
to
have
stuck
around
a
little
while
longer
it
faded
to
thin
lacing
after
a
couple
of
minutes
this
would
get
a
perfect
score
there
is
a
good
bit
of
yeast
floating
around
in
this
beers
apricot
body
i
dont
think
i
can
pick
out
all
of
the
different
aromas
im
detecting
peach
grapefruit
lemon
orange
pear
pepper
herbs
belgian
yeast
and
funk
every
fantôme
ive
ever
tasted
has
been
delectable
the
chocolat
that
didnt
taste
like
chocolate
was
the
only
one
that
wasnt
amazing
the
spicy
bitterness
the
fruity
sweetness
the
tart
fruitiness
the
funk
the
floral
notes
this
is
unbelievably
delicious
and
its
very
refreshing
even
though
it
has
a
dry
mouthfeel
totally
worth
the
12
overall
this
is
a
nice
saison
as
theyre
all
different
youll
just
have
to
try
this
one
and
see
what
you
think
its
a
lot
more
earthy
and
musty
than
ommegangs
toprated
brew
but
i
feel
this
has
a
more
authentic
flavor
to
it
md
an
evolving
mouthfeel
from
astringent
to
smooth
with
the
help
of
constantly
fine
and
creamy
fizz
against
a
dryishsour
palate
this
mediumbodied
heavyweight
treads
lightly
almost
ideal
as
a
thirstquencher
like
some
semidry
sparkling
wines
its
hardly
my
choice
for
a
session
saison
for
which
i
prefer
a
rounder
and
slightly
sweeter
version
but
this
one
really
is
helluva
distinct
beer
to
savour
to
me
its
a
musttry
and
something
id
love
to
go
back
to
whenever
given
a
chance
a
new
favorite
of
mine
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
not
a
perfect
5
due
to
the
higher
abv
and
slightly
abrasive
spiciness
still
an
excellent
beer
id
love
to
try
it
cellared
the
taste
too
has
a
citrus
flavor
but
well
balanced
with
sour
notes
and
apple
tang
a
hint
of
coriander
and
clove
fill
it
out
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
the
750
ml
split
between
us
two
was
not
enough
we
were
sad
to
see
it
go
really
a
fantastic
saison
one
of
the
fruitier
ones
out
there
for
sure
but
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
having
again
damn
good
damn
drinkable
lingers
on
the
palate
forever
with
its
pleasant
blend
of
spices
none
of
that
belgian
funky
horseblanket
stuff
here
just
a
hell
of
a
beer
i
could
forsee
the
inital
taste
becoming
a
little
bit
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
750
but
if
there
is
no
edit
below
assume
not
this
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
fruitiness
with
the
yeast
qualities
and
dryness
each
sip
is
complex
and
interesting
alcohol
is
not
evident
quite
nice
overall
recent
bottles
have
really
showed
dany
prignons
inconsistent
brewing
fantome
saison
is
really
only
a
4
7
2025
of
the
time
sometimes
it
is
bone
dry
and
sour
and
sometimes
it
is
very
sweet
so
i
am
lowering
my
score
for
now
until
i
have
a
bottle
that
shocks
me
again
after
a
bit
of
struggling
the
cork
releases

a

pop

into

this
was
my
first
fantome
and
it
was
really
a
great
one
drinkability
even
this
seemingly
off
sample
is
highly
drinkable
ill
try
again
and
rereview
at
the
next
opportunity
i
expect
positive
results
follow
up
i
didnt
finish
the
750
in
one
night
so
much
for
drinkability
and
so
i
had
the
last
bit
this
evening
lots
of
chewy
brown
yeast
bits
stuck
between
my
teeth
and
overall
i
can
say
i
like
this
beer
but
its
a
strange
beer
much
harder
to
get
my
arms
around
that
other
saisons
that
i
may
have
rated
lower
this
one
is
more
complex
more
interesting
and
in
some
ways
i
really
like
this
beer
but
its
not
as
easy
to
enjoy
as
some
others
ratings
revised
accordingly
drinkability
i
wished
i
had
another
on
hand
the
beer
gods
are
clearly
smiling
upon
brasserie
fantome
and
all
who
imbibe
their
fine
ales
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
saison
is
light
and
refreshing
providing
a
great
ale
for
those
lazy
hazy
summer
days
or
mid50
degree
postchristmas
prenew
years
december
days
d
i
found
a
wonderful
fizzy
yellow
beer
this
as
very
subtle
complexity
and
it
is
hard
to
pull
out
specific
flavors
even
though
it
is
8
abv
it
is
very
smooth
and
light
the
sourness
is
not
overpowering
but
compliments
the
fruity
hints
and
the
bitterness
the
taste
sour
but
sweet
with
fruity
flavors
all
over
the
place
orange
strawberry
lemon
peach
apple
and
probably
others
a
subtle
spicy
effect
is
also
noticable
most
notably
a
peppery
there
are
hints
of
clove
and
corriander
that
sorts
of
lends
a
drying
effect
the
strawberry
flavor
develops
some
strength
as
the
beer
warms
it
feels
thicker
than
it
might
actually
be
with
a
slightly
oily
feeling
in
the
mouth
light
airy
carbonation
cleans
things
up
perfectly
very
drinkable
and
delicious
an
excellent
saison
that
really
puts
other
examples
of
the
style
to
shame
at
least
the
others
ive
had
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
color
the
head
is
massive
fluffy
and
white
and
recedes
slowly
the
aroma
is
of
oranges
not
orange
peel
like
you
would
find
in
a
hefe
wiezen
but
actual
oranges
spices
and
tartness
are
also
present
in
the
aroma
but
are
rather
mild
the
sip
is
yeast
and
dry
transitioning
into
a
juicy
orange
finish
which
quickly
reverts
back
into
a
dry
yeasty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
lighter
than
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
it
is
flavorful
and
complex
without
being
in
your
face
which
is
always
a
plus
in
my
book
taste
carbonation
nice
and
lively
it
gave
this
beer
a
nice
citrucy
pop
with
bread
flavors
a
strange
hop
profile
my
guess
is
he
uses
spent
hops
and
the
finish
is
yeasty
and
bitter
like
banana
peels
very
nice
stuff
this
bottle
had
been
in
the
cellar
for
at
least
a
year
i
did
not
notice
any
evolution
good
or
bad
ooohhh
that
smell
that
smell
of
saison
around
you
the
aroma
is
exactly
what
ive
come
to
expect
froma
topnotch
saison
yeasty
orange
herbs
strawberry
this
beer
poured
an
average
frothy
head
with
excellent
lacing
the
body
was
murky
with
lots
of
small
yeast
particles
emptied
the
entire
bottle
the
body
was
amber
the
initial
flavor
is
sweet
and
heavy
with
a
moderately
sweet
average
length
finished
mouthfeel
was
lively
and
dry
one
of
my
favorite
saisons
750
ml
bottle
corked
and
capped
this
beer
pours
out
a
brilliant
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeast
orange
coriander
and
strawberry
slightly
tart
flavor
at
first
then
turns
fruity
with
strawberry
grape
orange
and
lemon
this
is
the
only
beer
ive
ever
had
that
tasted
like
strawberry
a
bit
musty
finishes
dry
drinkability
is
outstanding
this
beer
is
expensive
i
paid
10
for
this
bottle
but
its
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
saison
beer
shortly
after
georgia
began
allowing
the
importation
of
higher
alcohol
content
beers
the
bottle
was
green
glass
with
a
cork
and
a
metal
cap
there
was
a
rather
simple
label
with
the
image
of
a
ghost
this
beer
was
rich
and
full
of
character
lingering
notes
of
rustic
herbal
flavours
throughout
citrus
flavours
abounded
with
hints
of
musty
earth
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
some
bits
of
sediment
lingered
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
was
not
able
to
really
make
out
the
colour
of
this
ale
as
i
drank
it
directly
from
its
bottle
needless
to
say
it
made
quite
an
impression
on
me
the
drinkability
is
about
right
sessionable
to
a
point
as
its
abv
and
carbonation
catches
up
to
ya
nice
berry
burps
a
tender
mild
treat
thats
got
lots
of
things
going
for
it
complicated
yet
simple
and
delicately
natured
a
fun
beer
dont
pass
it
up
recommended
this
is
what
i
would
want
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
forget
the
supposed
8
abv
im
not
noticing
it
as
i
progress
through
the
glass
the
sour
funky
notes
become
just
slightly
more
noticeable
there
couldnt
be
a
greater
disparity
between
what
i
would
describe
as
my
perfect
beer
and
the
beer
sitting
before
me
that
makes
it
all
the
more
amazing
that
i
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
it
just
goes
to
show
what
dedication
daring
and
a
considerable
amount
of
skill
can
accomplish
i
love
having
my
horizons
expanded
so
i
couldnt
be
more
thrilled
that
fantome
saison
has
blown
them
wide
open
this
is
a
very
wellconceived
and
made
concoction
i
really
like
to
see
and
smell
a
pour
and
this
one
was
near
perfect
a
funky
nose
on
this
golden
hazy
ale
gave
you
a
hint
of
what
was
to
come
the
first
taste
was
that
of
a
strawberry
lambic

like
the
hanssens
oudbeitje
as
it
warms
slightly
there
are
a
number
of
great
fruit
flavors
kiwi
honey
dew
and
strawberry
all
in
a
slightly
funky
world
class
ale
this
is
so
good
and
easy
to
drink
setting
the
standard
for
the
style
great
depth
of
flavors
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
and
enough
alcohol
to
put
a
smile
on
your
face
750
ml
corked
and
capped
bottle
my
first
blog
review
all
others
were
different
serving
variations
overall
wow
just
incredible
best
saison
ive
had
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
the
taste
is
both
refreshing
and
complex
drinkability
hell
id
go
for
it
again
easily
were
the
price
a
little
lower
that
was
it
for
me
i
just
couldnt
get
past
the
smell
but
i
still
was
intrigued
i
will
revisit
this
some
day
strictly
because
of
the
smell
this
fantome
was
a
bit
too
funky
for
me
wow
great
brew
i
like
saisons
and
this
one
is
exceptional
hazy
near
copper
yellow
hued
with
a
decent
cap
of
foam
that
didnt
last
quite
as
long
as
id
like
aroma
was
a
bit
muted
but
stillenticing
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
funky
yeast
behing
a
fruity
floral
scent
taste
is
amazing
fruity
tart
sour
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
grainy
malt
i
could
drink
this
all
night
8
or
not
this
saison
drinks
like
a
light
wine
a
pinot
grigio
or
sauvignon
blanc
not
in
terms
of
flavor
but
re
the
alcohol
presence
a
classic
for
the
style
and
one
that
i
will
continue
to
share
with
friends
perhaps
the
godfather
of
all
saisons
this
beer
never
disappoints
as
soon
as
the
bottle
is
uncorked
a
steady
flow
of
carbonated
beer
flows
from
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
seemingly
never
lets
up
as
the
beer
is
decanted
into
the
snifter
it
releases
a
dull
rusty
hazy
peach
color
and
a
film
of
foam
sustains
itself
atop
the
beer
active
carbonation
puts
on
quite
a
show
good
aromas
of
floral
spicy
and
tart
flavors
of
oranges
peaches
lemons
and
pears
spiciness
of
cinnemon
corriander
curraco
and
pepper
vineous
and
almost
winelike
remaining
tartness
that
doesnt
become
astringent
or
sour
tartness
weaves
into
out
out
of
the
fresh
spicy
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
light
malt
with
wheat
sweetness
and
texture
give
a
much
needed
breadiness
and
creaminess
soft
texture
that
is
slightly
scrubbed
medium
body
dry
finish
with
mild
phenolic
alcohols
throughout
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
generally
i
can
expect
saisons
to
show
a
bit
more
sweetness
but
this
one
is
as
dry
as
a
bone
drinkability
oh
dear
lord
back
up
a
tanker
to
my
house
and
turn
on
the
hose
this
is
what
beer
drinking
is
all
about
one
of
the
most
drinkable
saisons
if
not
beers
period
ive
yet
encountered
scary
good
poured
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
aroma
of
citrus
yeast
herb
and
earthiness
it
had
a
very
complex
flavor
including
a
smorgasbord
of
fruits
and
a
slight
spicyness
that
i
really
liked
a
slightly
bitter
citrus
wise
comes
through
in
the
end
as
well
smooth
and
crisp
slightly
juicy
overall
this
saison
by
brasserie
fantôme
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
period
full
stop
highly
drinkable
with
an
aroma
that
simply
kicks
ass
and
a
complexity
that
just
begs
you
to
keep
on
sippin
fantôme
saison
went
very
well
with
the
seasoned
ahi
tuna
and
seasoned
noodles
i
had
for
dinner
a
definitive
example
of
the
style
a
beer
any
beer
enthusiast
should
be
seeking
out
if
they
want
to
experience
a
firstrate
saison
on
the
tasting
i
was
hit
with
an
overpowering
coriander
and
citrus
zest
i
can
taste
the
superior
craft
in
this
beer
but
wit
the
spice
in
it
you
might
as
well
add
a
lemon
to
a
hefe
weisen
and
call
it
even
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
nice
with
a
silk
finish
if
you
like
heady
hws
then
go
for
it
conclusion
this
brew
is
both
everything
and
nothing
its
just
how
you
interpret
the
tastes
and
aromas
for
me
personally
though
the
huge
barnyard
aspect
was
a
bit
too
much
artisanaal
is
ok
but
this
was
too
much
one
things
for
sure
though
its
got
character
aplenty
had
this
ontap
at
romans
pub
this
beer
doesnt
look
like
much
a
cloudy
golden
color
not
much
more
attractive
than
the
spotted
cow
im
used
to
drinking
which
is
to
say
pretty
mundane
the
smell
and
the
taste
thoughamazing
the
best
smellingtasting
beer
ive
ever
had
smells
very
much
like
tropical
fruit
and
bubblegum
with
a
little
bit
of
sourness
in
the
mix
as
well
its
a
very
sweet
smell
but
somehow
not
cloying
in
any
way
in
fact
its
downright
alluring
tastes
initially
lemon
peels
citrusy
and
sour
with
a
sweet
bubblegum
finish
again
i
cant
explain
ityou
would
naturally
think
that
a
bubblegum
beer
would
be
awful
sweet
to
the
point
of
undrinkable
but
this
was
not
it
was
perfectly
balanced
by
the
very
pleasant
sourness
and
had
a
very
nice
dry
mouthfeel
fucking
amazing
beer
very
enjoyable
cheers
im
going
to
drop
another
10
and
give
this
one
more
shot
as
i
will
admit
this
isnt
a
style
that
i
get
into
and
this
could
have
been
a
bad
bottle
the
envelope
has
been
pushed
until
breaking
damn
fine
carbonation
is
lowmedium
which
suits
the
style
perfectly
as
it
begins
to
warm
lemony
citrus
woody
flavors
make
themselves
known
this
thing
is
growing
on
me
peach
in
colour
with
lots
of
carbonation
fantastically
fruity
and
yeasty
in
both
the
nose
and
the
mouth
there
are
minor
notes
of
barnyard
and
various
spices
which
enhances
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
light
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
without
compromising
its
complexity
highly
drinkable
stuff
its
just
too
bad
i
cant
get
this
locally
drinkability
is
good
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
if
i
could
find
it
a
nice
brew
hope
it
represents
this
style
because
i
will
be
looking
for
saisons
in
the
future

im
becoming
a
big
fan
of
saisons
and
this
one
sets
a
nice
standard
for
the
style
ive
been
keeping
a
small
stash
of
ommegang
hennepin
on
hand
to
slake
my
desire
for
this
style
but
an
excellent
belgian
saison
like
this
one
is
a
special
treat
truly
exceptional
drinkability
i
love
grazing
in
the
meadow
with
sheep
taking
in
the
grassy
herbal
floral
and
funky
earthiness
that
is
contained
in
a
bottle
like
this
one
the
citrusy
lemon
character
really
adds
an
inviting
component
to
the
drinkability
nice
and
dry
with
a
long
finish
lovely
750ml
corked
and
capped
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
this
beer
pours
an
extremely
carbonated
bright
hazy
orange
juice
looking
color
huge
frothy
head
is
controllable
on
the
pour
but
barely
tons
and
tons
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
musty
yeasty
funkiness
i
come
to
expect
in
good
saisons
theres
also
fruits
and
spices
involved
with
the
yeast
granny
smith
apples
along
with
more
tropical
fruits
then
some
anise
im
getting
some
freshly
cut
grass
in
there
as
well
taste
brings
more
fruityness
upfront
really
fresh
whole
strawberries
and
watermelons
more
of
a
floral
element
comes
in
with
a
garden
vegetable
taste
yeasty
depth
underneath
spritzy
in
the
feel
im
tasting
the
carbonation
a
bit
finish
is
dry
and
holds
well
this
could
be
confused
for
many
other
styles
and
to
me
is
reminiscent
of
champagne
whatever
the
complexity
and
depth
of
flavors
in
this
beer
make
it
truly
a
great
beer
theres
an
immediate
taste
of
horse
leather
recently
worn
its
surprisingly
dry
for
recently
worn
horse
leather
this
must
have
been
stirred
by
a
horse
with
sugar
on
its
hoof
and
horehound
mint
and
miners
lettuce
on
its
breath
wild
man
its
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
with
funky
burps
its
quenching
and
interesting
and
doest
seem
anywhere
close
to
8
it
gets
drier
as
i
progress
down
the
bottle
but
theres
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
drinking
this
is
complicated
enough
to
keep
talking
about
but
hey
its
fantastic
it
is
now
my
goal
to
drink
every
fantome
beer
i
can
get
my
lips
on
and
ill
steal
yours
if
youre
not
watching
it
smells
like
theres
noble
hops
in
here
light
pepper
and
spice
hints
come
through
in
the
smell
and
it
goes
along
very
well
with
the
other
characteristics
of
the
style
the
taste
brings
excellent
combinations
of
fruit
spice
and
malt
in
different
layers
the
mouthfeel
is
brilliant
and
drinkability
is
outstanding
the
beer
poured
into
an
oversize
wine
glass
a
bright
gold
very
hazy
with
a
thick
white
head
that
receded
quickly
into
the
glass
the
smell
has
bread
dough
grapefruit
and
a
couple
of
layers
of
spice
the
finish
on
the
nose
has
more
orange
than
grapefruit
the
taste
has
a
pleasant
tanginess
up
front
delivered
in
the
form
of
the
citrus
the
spiciness
i
detected
in
the
aroma
blends
into
sweetness
delivered
by
the
malt
the
yeastbread
dough
character
disperses
all
together
in
the
flavor
finish
has
a
mild
peppery
bite
that
lingers
and
blends
with
the
alcohol
to
generate
a
little
heat
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
slick
and
helps
to
produce
a
decent
drinakbility
notes
the
best
saison
ive
ever
had
its
a
lot
more
balanced
that
other
saisons
that
i
have
had
just
perfectly
blended
malt
hops
spices
and
funky
yeast
amazingly
drinkable
even
though
its
warmed
up
way
past
it
serving
temperature
so
light
i
could
drink
this
on
a
hot

day

a
quick
note
i
want
to
thank
the
alström
bros
and
all
the
members
here
at
ba
we
have
a
wonderful
thing
going
here
youve
all
helped
me
discover
things
i
never
would
have
on
my
own
this
is
my
200th
review
and
190
of
the
beers
i
reviewed
so
far
i
never
would
have
tried

it
werent

of
you
out

thanks
guys
you

pours
a
peachtinged

a
huge
frothy
white

that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
film
and
lace
smells
of
peppery
spices
with
sweetly
floral
tones
yeast
and
a
bit
of
horseblanket
sourness
flavors
are
a
delicate
intermingling
of
peppery

and
strong

the
tastes
are
very
well
balanced

remain
interesting

the

lush
a
childhood
memory
inducing
drug
that
will
keep
your
brain
dancing
while
there
is
still
liquid
left
in
the
glass
its
difficult
to
believe
a
high
percentage
of
alcohol
when
a
bottle
drains
so
quick
required
drinking
for
anyone
that
says
they
like
beer
drinkability
best
thing
about
this
brew
in
my
opinion
is
that
its
a
great
warmer
between
the
large
bottle
the
bittersweet
taste
and
8
abv
this
beer
is
definitely
something
to
enjoy
i
shared
it
with
a
friend
but
could
have
easily
drank
this
myself
and
almost
wish
i
would
have

very
unique

i
will
certainly
seek
more

i
also

well
along
with
some
pepper

not
nearly
as
peppery
as
some
others
of
the
style

thanks
to
the
mother
in

for
bringing
it

i
had
a
nice
beerfest
yesterday
while
watching
the
first
playoff
football
games
and
consumed
about
6
bombers
with
other
ba
member
spinlock
fortunately
it
was
my
first
beer
that
i
had
so
it
was
clear
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
when
i
woke
up
this
morning
i
couldnt
stop
thinking
about
this
beer
and
had
to
buy
another
today
and
try
it
to
really
give
a
100
acurate
rating
i
was
thinking
of
giving
it
straight
5s
that
would
have
been
a
first
for
me
but
wavered
a
bit
on
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
overall
its
an
incredible
beer
that
i
will
be
having
many
more
times
in
my
future
i
am
getting
married
in
september
and
am
narrowing
down
my
list
of
beers
to
bring
with
me
this
will
be
one
of
them
and
it
may
very
well
be
the
one
on
the
main
table
getting
consumed
as
everyone
toasts
at
my
wedding
its
not
an
everyday
beer
though
this
to
me
is
a
special
occasion
beer
this
falls
in
the
same
category
of
stone
ris
for
me
its
too
good
to
have
for
just
any
random
beer
craving
a
most
awesome
crafted
beer
that
has
gained
a
big
spot
in
my
heart
worth
10
hell
yes
if
any
of
you
are
wine
lovers
take
this
into
consideration
a
great
bottle
of
wine
will
run
you
typically
at
least
3040
minimum
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
and
runs
you
10
on
average
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
worth
the
money
seek
it
buy
it
drink
it
and
savor
it
had
this
on
tap
at
rich
os
public
house
pours
a
cloudy
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
had
great
retention
and
left
nice
lacing
in
a
fantome
tulip
glass
the
aroma
was
big
lots
of
orange
lemon
spice
pepper
with
that
strange
funky
smell
that
fantome
is
known
for
very
nice
the
flavor
was
very
complex
lots
of
orange
and
lemon
with
some
spices
the
carbonation
has
a
great
presence
in
the
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
on
the
body
wonderful
brew
fantome
saison
off
tap
how
can
i
pass
this
one
up
ive
had
it
out
of
a
bottle
before
but
this
was
a
superb
beer
experience
the
sweet
nectar
was
poured
off
tap
into
a
fantome
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
beautiful
oranged
yellow
color
wtih
a
thick
billowing
head
over
top
that
didnt
want
to
fall
for
anything
what
a
nose
lemon
acid
slight
pepper
grapefruity
citrus
damn
all
i
can
say
nirvana
the
nose
was
great
the
flavor
was
perfection
there
is
an
underlying
mandarin
orange
sweetness
that
is
overlayed
with
huge
lemony
citrus
acidity
and
peppery
notes
there
is
a
whole
lot
more
going
on
in
there
but
i
couldnt
put
pen
to
paper
and
give
it
justice
suffice
to
say
it
was
orgasmic
the
feel
was
right
below
moderate
exactly
where
it
should
be
my
only
issue
was
that
i
was
drinking
it
in
the
dead
of
winter
when
i
thoguht
it
should
be
a
summer
brew
the
drinkability
is
second
to
none
i
could
have
parked
my
glass
under
the
tap
all
night
and
just
drank
this
if
i
ever
find
it
i
will
be
forced
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
keg
for
home
i
will
actively
seek
this
beer
out
whenever
i
can
im
very
glad
i
finally
tried
this
what
a
unique
brew
the
prominent
aroma
and
flavor
i
detected
was
apples
but
not
overdone
like
the
ephemere
huge
spritzy
head
foam
and
lacing
right
to
the
last
drop
high
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
detract
quenching
and
great
with
the
veal
and
white
eggplant
with
garlic
that
we
had
for
dinner
my
wife
loved
it
also
i
followed
with
one
of
my
favorites
hennepin
and
the
fantome
was
better
cant
wait
to
get
more
fantastically
eyeopening
so
ive
just
gotten
really
into
fantome
and
when
i
first
tried
it
i
really
had
no
idea
what
i
was
getting
into
reading
the
above
review
is
interesting
i
just
had
the
saison
again
last
night
and
i
taste
so
much
more
in
it
so
good
complex
a
bit
funky
and
horsey
refreshing
zesty
even
a
little
sour
nice
and
spicey
peppery
and
yeasty
love
that
sour
kick
too
my
girlfriend
loved
it
too
so
much
that
she
kept
talking
about
it
today
she
never
does
that
im
just
glad
that
i
can
appreciate
a
beer
like
this
when
apparently
i
used
to
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
punch
nah
the
subtleties
are
where
its
at
for
this
beer
nothing
gets
in
the
way
or
takes
over
and
thats
what
makes
all
the
tastes
come
together
so
beautifully
yum
lemony
coriander
aroma
thats
a
bity
spicy
and
earthy
fluffy
bright
white
head
with
a
shiny
mousse
textured
top
leaves
scattered
noodles
of
lace
hazy
straw
colored
beer
with
streams
of
small
bubbles
rising
slowly
from
the
bottom
lemony
flavor
is
almost
sour
but
the
beer
remains
fairly
dry
a
mild
spicyness
floats
in
midway
followed
by
a
mellow
earthiness
in
the
finish
which
is
even
stronger
with
a
burb
nice
solid
body
is
light
enough
that
it
goes
down
easy
yet
thick
enough
to
carry
all
those
flavors
lots
of
interesting
mellow
spices
and
an
underlying
yeasty
earthiness
to
this
beer
that
make
for
a
truely
interesting
beer
its
like
theres
something
new
every
sip
i
think
i
get
the
horse
blanket
thing
but
i
might
take
a
drive
out
to
the
country
tomorrow
just
to
make
sure
has
anyone
else
had
experience
with
trying
to
get
some
distance
out
of
a
large
bottle
it
pours
a
light
tan
color
with
a
soft
white
head
its
cloudy
as
heck
then
it
gets
murky
with
the
sediment
at
the
end
the
aroma
is
slightly
floral
but
mild
and
does
not
improve
with
warming
carbonation
is
moderate
on
tasting
i
get
a
relatively
harsh
bitterness
of
neutral
hops
there
seems
to
be
some
spiciness
perhaps
a
bit
of
fruit
very
cluttered
and
confusing
to
me
surprisingly
there
is
a
pretty
clean
malt
flavor
that
surges
near
the
end
medium
bodied
alcohol
is
subtle
but
the
effects
are
felt
later
overall
i
need
to
try
this
again
sometime
but
not
too
soon
i
tried
the
beer
over
a
long
time
at
various
temperatures
but
the
harsh
bitterness
is
out
of
balance
like
a
bad
american
lager
recipe
with
a
tiny
bit
of
spices
added
and
hmmmm
lordy
i
love
it
fresh
yeasty
citric
fruity
tasty
full
of
deliciousness
so
tasty
light
to
medium
in
body
very
fresh
and
zesty
tastiness
personified
what
a
jewel
just
juicy
and
nice
yum
yum
double

wow
this
is
a
magnificent
saison
id
like
to
keep
this
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
at
moments
notice
deeeelicious
ng
be
careful
this
stuff
tastes
like
a
beer
with
half
the
alcohol
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
light
fruity
brew
is
8

the
smell
is
sweet
with
apples
and
has
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
as
well
a
very
powerful
aroma
that
is
intoxicating
i
could
sniff
this
all
night
the
taste
is
also
full
of
malt

spices
a
little

of
pepper
dances
on
the

a
wisp
of
malt
lemon
and
a
touch
of
mint
exquisite
this
beer
reminds
me
of
an
old
world
pastoral
landscape
the
phantoms
of
the
past
seem
to
spring
from
the
glass
with
its
earthy
aroma
and
to
the
bone
sourness
color
and
faint
aroma
of
cut
hay
helps
the
metaphor
along
but
the
crisp
mouthfeel
and
tart
and
dangerously
refreshing
sourness
awake
us
into
the
present
the
sourness
is
melded
with
sweetness
hints
of
lemon
and
berry
maybe
rhubarb
are
permeated
throughout
the
taste
somehow
complex
yet
accesssible
defintiely
the
best
of
its
class
that
i
have
tried
thus
far
will
probably
be
a
summertime
favorite
as
i
think
it
would
pair
exceedingly
well
with
grilled
seafood
a
yard
workers
delight
another
plus
for
me
is
that
my
wife
loves
this
beer
as
much
as
i
driving
up
the
drinkablity
to
exceptional
limits
notes
my
first
saison
and
there
are
lots
of
subtle
flavors
to
be
found
in
this
the
carbonation
and
fruit
flavors
make
it
crisp
and
refreshing
the
8
means
finishing
the
750ml
by
yourself
can
take
care
of
you
for
the
evening
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
cant
imagine
the
flavor
not
being
liked
by
anyone
i
must
say
thats
one
chessy
label
luckily
we
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
older
than
usual
because
i
didnt
get
a
huge
head
out
of
this
beer
but
the
carbonation
was
lively
in
this
beer
so
all
was
not
lost
poured
out
a
hazy
golden
color
with
lots
of
yeast
floating
around
everywhere
lots
of
fruit
hit
the
nose
apples
pears
grapes
with
some
hints
of
yeast
and
spiceiness
just
wonderful
taste
consisted
of
fruity
notes
mixed
in
with
some
peppery
spiciness
with
a
very
tartlike
finish
but
everything
was
controlled
nicely
apples
come
into
play
for
the
aftertaste
mixed
in
with
some
nutmeg
type
spice
it
was
tartful
but
not
over
the
edge
what
a
terrific
brew
mouthfeel
is
clean
smooth
and
surprisingly
full
in
form
not
a
big
bodied
beer
but
it
is
far
from
thin
easy
to
drink
as
both
flavor
and
aroma
combine
to
make
this
experience
one
to
remember
one
bottle
is
enough
to
please
but
a
second
is
very
tempting
light
to
medium
bodied
the
abv
doesnt
hide
in
this
one
either
very
complex
such
a
unique
beer
every
bottle
has
a
character
unto
itself
ive
heard
people
say
it
can
be
off
at
times
but
when
its
on
its
sheer
brilliance
ive
also
had
the
draft
but
the
kegging
kills
the
character
quite
a
bit
and
turns
it
into
almost
a
lambic
more
than
a
saison
i
certainly
would
have
this
one
again
salutelong
love
beer
paired
with
rosemarythyme
chicken
and
rice
pilaf
this
is
one
tasty
beverage
definitely
a
good
wine
replacement
this
beer
pours
with
a
yellow
cloudy
maybe
not
left
to
its
own
for
a
few
days
slightly
rocky
head
which
subsides
to
a
skim
little
bubbles
come
up
through
the
beer
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
slight
to
me
with
a
little
lemon
and
no
detectable
alcohol
the
taste
is
lemony
sweet
with
a
little
malt
always
present
and
very
little
bitterness
except
that
contributed
by
a
persistent
apricot
undertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
like
softened
water
with
a
slight
prickle
on
the
tongue
this
reminds
me
of
some
mead
homebrew
that
i
once
had
its
not
the
roller
coaster
of
other
saisons
its
an
8
abv
beer
that
hides
its
strength
with
its
fruitiness
ill
give
it
another
walk
as
a
food
beer
probably
pairing
it
with
lemon
chicken
as
a
session
saison
it
is
somewhat
boring
i
cant
help
but
compare
it
to
dupont
which
in
its
vieille
provision
of
6
5abv
is
more
of
a
strong
session
beer
for
me
fantome
is
more
refined
stronger
and
more
consistent
from
start
to
finish
this
is
actually
a
boring
saison
by
itself
i
will
edit
this
review
after
ive
had
another
with
food
this
is
eight
percent
abv
unreal
while
this
isnt
really
a
true
saison
due
to
its
alcohol
content
it
certainly
drinks
like
one
truly
unique
and
unbelievably
delicious
highly
recommended
6
99
for
a
750ml
overall
impression
finally
got
around
to
tasting
this
one
fantomes
house
beer
not
sure
how
sour
it
should
or
shouldnt
be
if
this
is
a
tainted
bottle
then
it
is
just
starting
to
show
the
signs
still
a
great
saison
and
definitely
a
testament
to
what
saisons
are
all
about
rustic
complex
everchanging
volatile
the
great
thing
about
this
little
brewery
is
that
they
can
keep
cranking
out
this
artistic
little
gems
even
if
most
belgians
havent
even
heard
of
them
id
venture
to
guess
that
the
us
demand
for
fantome
beers
is
a
large
portion
of
thier
market
its
a
shame
its
not
more
widely
appreciated
in
belgium
pours
a
nicely
colored
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
good
healthy
carbonation
mixed
aromatics
green
apple
candied
blood
orange
mango
pineapple
white
pepper
a
smidge
of
pine
and
yeasty
righteousness
very
impressive
tastes
light
and
airy
despite
its
abv
a
bit
of
yeastiness
shines
through
it
all
along
with
the
citrusy
and
tropical
malt
yeast
profile
goes
a
little
bit
tart
in
the
middle
but
brings
it
back
to
the
sweetness
has
a
strange
wet
dog
characteristic
that
only
shows
when
sipping
not
in
the
aroma
not
offensive
however
hops
are
there
but
dont
play
that
large
of
a
role
in
this
beer
i
like
this
saison
very
much
effervescent
and
crisp
quintessential
summer
quaffer
appearance
color
is
a
hazed
golden
orange
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
after
somewhat
of
a
vigorous
pour
as
far
as
lacing
it
forms
in
even
bands
very
nicely
belgian
style
lacing
at
that
aroma
first
thing
is
the
pineapple
juice
aromatics
that
come
out
here
awesome
a
bit
tart
with
mild
alcohol
notes
in
the
background
taste
very
clean
and
estery
fruits
light
and
fluffy
tones
the
perfect
summer
ale
i
definitely
am
amazed
by
the
fruit
tones
this
beer
produces
exotic
tropical
juice
with
some
peppery
notes
with
the
yeast
dregs
added
it
takes
on
herbal
tone
with
spices
arising
and
grassy
semimusty
tones
its
very
nice
im
a
fan
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
in
body
smooth
effervescent
carbonation
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
im
pleased
with
this
offering
definitely
will
track
some
down
this
summer
drinkability
incredible
offering
complexity
light
and
refreshing
along
with
some
alcohol
kick
in
there
as
well
very
balanced
an
awesome
saison
makes
me
want
to
track
more
brews
down
in
this
category
even
flat
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
i
need
to
buy
another
bottle
to
see
the
difference
i
can
tell
that
i
would
love
this
beer
if
it
were
carbonated
wellcarbonated
to
provide
relief
from
the
sour
notes
and
make
it
an
excellent
companion
to
a
meal
very
drinkable
a
very
unique
unrestrained
natural
flavor
emerges
immediately
from
this
beer
unripened
pear
melon
rind
and
lemon
peel
bitterness
the
finish
seems
to
drop
off
into
an
almost
unpleasant
raw
bitterness
slightly
awkward
but
by
no
means
bad
more
unexpected
i
think
than
anything
else
a
superior
brew
f
the
feel
is
somewhat
champaign
like
with
a
sense
of
carbonation
in
each
sip
less
full
feeling
and
greatly
crisp
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
level
which
never
beomes
noticeable
i
sampled
this
with
spicy
shrimp
and
thai
rice
noodles
it
paired
very
well
the
effervescence
of
the
beer
cleansed
the
palate
and
flavors
helped
to
soothe
the
heat
quite
a
delicious
offering
my
only
problem
was
opening
the
bottle
the
soft
cork
broke
apart
and
i
had
to
decant
the
beer
before
i
could
pour
it
into
a
glass
not
the
worst
of
things
but
certainly
an
inconvenience
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
certainly
one
of
the
strangest
in
a
good
way
beers
i
have
tasted
to
date
first
off
the
beer
poured
an
awesome
hazy
very
unique
colora
shade
of
very
light
caramel
with
some
orange
and
golden
hues
the
aromatics
were
extremely
complex
with
peach
citrusorange
and
lemonsome
spice
coriander
perhaps
the
aromatics
were
so
very
insidious
it
was
hard
to
stop
smelling
and
take
a
drink
in
the
mouth
a
lovely
jolt
of
bright
citrus
especially
grapefruit
zest
followed
by
some
orange
and
lemon
the
ever
present
bitter
grapefruit
zest
component
was
very
refreshing
and
unrelenting
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bready
fruitcake
flavor
surfaced
and
added
to
the
flavor
profile
i
paired
this
with
beer
batter
catfish
and
a
bit
of
leftover
fried
rice
oddly
enough
i
used
a
simple
belgian
whitewitekerke
for
the
batter
this
was
a
nice
match
and
i
will
say
that
i
will
search
out
with
celerity
my
next
brew
from
this
brewery
cool
stuff
here
oh
how
cool
this
is
my
50th
review
one
to
remember
light
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
barnyard
and
yeasty
medium
body
yeasty
and
somewhat
barnyardish
slightly
sour
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
yet
another
nice
biere
de
garde
from
fantome
one
of
the
funkeyist
brewers
on
the
planet
the
cork
almost
blew
by
itself
when
i
released
the
cage
when
poured
there
was
a
huge
rush
of
carbonation
that
continues
to
bubble
the
color
was
a
goldenorange
with
a
thick
tan
head
it
has
a
super
fruity
medicinal
aroma
with
the
haylike
qualities
of
a
lambic
it
has
just
a
really
fresh
smell
the
aroma
is
more
complex
than
any
other
saisons
i
have
had
before
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
medicinal
with
a
different
spiced
flavor
that
i
have
never
had
before
it
is
light
on
the
palate
but
full
and
sneaky
this
is
a
complex
beer
in
aroma
and
flavor
a
definite
top
notch
beer
in
my
opinion
excellent
this
beer
was
served
to
me
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
color
that
when
held
to
the
light
had
a
golden
glimmer
to
it
the
head
was
creamy
and
rich
and
the
color
of
cloud
white
it
had
the
consistency
of
a
sticky
rich
whipped
cream
it
lasted
fairly
long
glass
then
eventually
fell
to
a
ring
around
the
edges
it
produced
a
sticky
lace
that
clinged
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
stretched
almost
the
whole
way
to
the
finish
the
aroma
was
of
a
giant
fruit
market
fresh
fruits
everywhere
i
nosed
bananas
pears
apples
sharp
grapefruit
fresh
melons
strawberries
sweet
honey
floral
hops
lite
as
it
warmed
spices
cloves
pepper
and
yeast
the
aroma
was
alittle
on
the
tart
side
but
not
sour
balanced
nicely
lets
just
say
that
my
friend
who
is
a
macro
drinker
loved
the
aroma
the
tastes
that
came
from
the
glass
were
just
as
pleasing
as
the
nose
if
not
more
flavors
of
strawberries
first
hit
me
then
bananas
then
a
whole
cornucopia
of
fresh
and
tart
fruits
then
spices
pepper
cloves
herbs
floral
hops
some
earthy
flavors
yeast
tad
wisp
of
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
a
malt
ends
fruity
with
a
hint
of
hop
medium
bodied
this
is
one
smooth
and
complex
beer
i
would
never
expect
so
many
flavors
out
of
one
little
glass
this
is
one
incredible
beer
words
cannot
give
it
justice
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
all
i
can
say
is
that
my
senses
thank
the
brewer
for
this
beergift

absolutely
first
class
much
props
to
bighuge
for
this
ghostly
treat
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
light
gold
color
and
formed
a
small
smooth
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
ring
like
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
hard
to
know
where
to
begin
it
is
very
floral
with
aromas
of
green
apple
and
various
citrus
smell
with
a
background
feel
of
standing
out
in
an
orchard
the
flavor
was
of
hops
citrus
and
some
corinader
the
finish
was
a
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
yet
slightly
tart
with
backing
of
the
corinader
creeping
in
i
have
tried
few
saisons
but
this
looks
to
be
a
fine
representative
of
the
style
a
unique
soooleftofcenter
version
of
the
saison
style
this
is
an
incredible
beer
it
would
be
great
to
give
to
people
who
think
all
beer
is
boring
and
tastes
the
same
overall
an
ale
that
screams
summer
on
the
farm
farm
fresh
with
no
artificial
anything
in
aroma
or
taste
light
refreshing
an
aroma
to
die
for
and
a
taste
thats
a
malty
fruit
salad
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
what
saisons
are
all
about
this
is
best
described
as
an
interesting
brew
and
an
interesting
version
of
the
style
sadly
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
they
seem
impossible
to
find
here
given
the
options
i
guess
its
worth
getting
though
imho
its
quite
overpriced
it
pours
a
hazy
grapefruit
color
with
plenty
of
yeast
bits
floating
about
the
head
is
a
fizzy
white
that
leaves
traces
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
after
the
initial
fade
swirling
the
glass
brings
the
head
back
to
life
the
smell
is
on
the
fruity
side
specifically
apples
and
pear
with
some
tartness
and
a
bit
of
that
musty
barnyard
smell
the
tartness
is
quite
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
certainly
not
overwhelming
and
in
fact
balanced
nicely
by
the
fruit
flavors
the
alcohol
smell
and
taste
blends
in
nicely
and
doesnt
detract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
the
beer
good
stuff
maybe
an
adolescence
spent
sucking
on
warheads
and
chewing
crybabies
killed
my
ability
to
perceive
sourness
but
i
didnt
think
this
was
sour
in
the
least
first
pour
was
clear
dark
gold
with
nice
white
fluff
the
second
pour
was
cloudy
it
seems
hard
to
keep
the
yeast
out
of
the
bottle
but
you
might
as
well
feed
me
yeast
as
much
as
i
like
yeast
in
my
beer
so
thats
not
a
problem
the
dominant
flavor
and
aroma
is
the
estery
fruitiness
ripe
plums
melons
and
bubblegum
make
for
a
soft
thick
front
the
middle
is
a
mild
bitterness
and
ends
with
a
lingering
crisp
malt
reminds
me
of
spring
it
has
some
of
the
same
aromas
i
remember
from
the
back
yard
of
my
parents
house
beside
the
horse
pasture
with
the
jonquil
flowers
and
pecan
trees
the
horse
blanket
is
there
in
the
tiniest
degree
but
id
say
its
more
like
the
inside
of
the
horse
shed
where
the
hay
and
horse
feed
dominate
the
smell
of
tackle
not
an
earthshattering
experience
but
i
like
this
an
apple
juice
colored
brew
on
the
first
pour
from
this
750
ml
bottle
what
an
appropriate
color
a
mediumsized
but
thick
head
forms
on
top
and
retains
well
second
pour
looks
like
an
aquarium
that
hasnt
been
cleaned
in
months
even
though
i
ieft
a
good
amount
in
the
bottle
floaties
galore
if
you
dont
like
yeast
sediment
in
your
saison
leave
quite
a
bit
of
this
in
the
bottle
wow
the
aroma
very
unique
and
powerful
supertart
sour
apple
and
candi
sugar
making
it
similar
to
a
sour
apple
candy
like
others
have
said
some
barnlike
or
horse
blanket
aromas
are
present
as
well
spicy
yeast
undertones
too
almost
christmasy
the
taste
although
very
different
from
the
aroma
is
also
unique
and
wonderful
first
in
at
the
front
are
malt
and
yeast
characteristics
the
maltiness
is
bready
and
caramelly
the
yeast
provides
some
spiciness
and
more
of
that
sour
apple
and
candi
sugar
but
its
much
more
subtle
here
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
gets
closer
to
the
back
it
gets
more
hoppy
that
muted
hoppiness
that
is
present
in
many
belgianstyle
beers
you
know
what
im
talking
about
right
now
im
starting
to
think
in
musical
terms
describing
this
you
know
what
that
means
it
means
that
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
i
love
it
therefore
its
influencing
me
to
be
more
creative
with
my
review
anyway
back
to
the
description
the
tart
fruitiness
stays
all
the
way
through
as
an
undertone
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
almost
sticky
which
fits
with
the
sour
apple
theme
smooth
and
thick
finish
this
beer
says
why
didnt
you
buy
more
bottles
of
me
to
me
its
expensive
but
its
definitely
worth
it
i
may
have
to
cheat
and
forget
my
rule
of
buying
only
beers
ive
never
tried
before
next
time
im
on
a
beer
run
give
me
more
now
the
beer
was
a
haze
orangetinted
gold
with
a
fairly
creamy
white
head
there
was
a
very
fruity
tart
nose
like
apple
jolly
ranchers
with
a
little
bit
of
farmhouse
funk
thrown
in
for
good
measure
this
was
an
extremely
delicious
saison
it
was
fruity
and
tart
but
not
puckeringly
so
for
balance
it
was
lightly
hopped
and
had
a
noticeable
pale
malt
sweetness
that
sweetness
is
important
to
me
in
the
flavor
profile
of
a
saison
and
some
beers
have
too
much
or
too
little
goldie
locks
thought
this
one
was
damn
near
perfect
in
terms
of
malt
poured
to
give
a
hazy
strawcolored
beer
with
thin
white
foam
the
smell
was
very
fruity
grapes
and
apples
the
taste
was
of
musty
grapes
sweet
but
thin
with
some
maltiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
with
modest
carbonation
but
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
the
drinkability
was
good
a
caliginous
golden
orange
color
on
the
pour
the
beer
is
loaded
with
dross
some
on
the
bottom
some
suspended
throughout
the
beer
head
is
immature
in
size
the
color
bright
white
the
consistency
creamy
and
the
left
over
lace
a
thick
and
sticky
sheet
to
coat
the
glass
i
would
say
one
of
the
sweetest
bouquets
of
any
beer
ive
sampled
in
years
over
ripe
cantaloupe
or
cotton
candy
come
to
mind
malt
underlies
it
all
a
real
treat
for
the
olfactory
senses
the
front
ambrosial
the
top
thick
and
sweet
finish
is
sparsely
carbonated
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
alcohol
bitter
lingering
aftertaste
and
a
satisfactory
representative
to
the
style
it
is
truly
a
shame
that
more
saisons
are
not
available
here
in
the
states
as
i
find
them
intriguing
and
quite
tasty
to
boot
403
pours
like
champagne
big
fizzy
white
head
reduces
to
a
thin
film
in
a
minute
murky
golden
orange
in
color
on
the
nose
i
get
some
bready
tones
a
blend
of
herbs
and
spices
and
yeast
pretty
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
body
is
light
taste
is
unlike
other
saisons
ive
had
very
spicy
and
tart
in
the
mouth
but
not
bad
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
a
little
bit
of
an
acidic
tinge
i
get
a
sour
apple
like
taste
one
that
makes
you
pucker
rather
than
wince
and
unlike
the
sour
apple
associated
with
a
green
beer
im
not
sure
what
kind
of
spicing
they
use
if
any
but
maybe
something
like
cinamon
or
bitter
orange
peel
curacao
interesting
beer
but
not
something
im
going
to
shell
out
out
6
a
bottle
for
my
first
saison
so
its
possible
i
will
come
back
at
some
point
and
revise
my
score
anyway
this
is
an
amazing
beer
apple
cider
color
bubbly
tan
head
at
first
pour
the
head
is
immense
and
the
incredible
carbonation
ensures
that
the
head
never
goes
away
in
fact
the
carbonation
was
almost
volcanic
in
appearance
there
were
three
separate
minitempests
in
my
glass
from
the
eruption
of
bubbles
rising
through
this
brew
how
to
describe
the
smell
imagine
walking
through
an
apple
orchard
in
autumn
while
holding
a
ripe
pineapple
to
your
nose
farm
fragrances
abound
the
taste
slices
of
green
apples
in
apple
cider
with
a
healthy
amount
of
pepper
and
coriander
spicy
earthy
intoxicating
complex
oh
yeah
this
is
the
stuff
of
life
the
turbid
light
oranged
hued
brew
is
topped
by
a
formidably
thick
dense
whipped
cream
like
head
that
leaves
intricate
lace
the
luscious
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
apricot
and
peach
fruit
esters
as
the
dominate
components
w
slightly
tarter
strawberry
and
citrus
notes
secondary
subdued
green
apple
acetaldehyde
exists
as
an
undertone
in
aroma
buttery
malt
becomes
perceptible
as
the
beer
warms
as
well
bittersweet
dried
citrus
peel
is
perceived
initially
then
yields
to
fructose
like
sweetness
mid
palate
while
a
combination
of
light
sour
dough
breadiness
and
coriander
round
out
the
taste
curacao
provides
most
of
the
bitterness
in
this
brew
since
hop
bitterness
is
very
mild
although
highly
carbonated
theres
sufficient
residual
dextrins
and
protein
for
a
relatively
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
quite
clean
w
peppery
notes
briefly
lingering
fantome
saison
is
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
its
got
tremendous
complexity
yet
remains
soft
overall
on
the
palate
unparalled
in
drinkability
this
is
a
miraculous
beer
orange
and
thick
with
a
creamy
head
my
first
experience
with
saisons
dupont
was
less
than
ideal
but
this
is
something
else
mild
euroskunk
in
the
odor
but
that
left
once
it
was
poured
in
the
glass
fruity
tart
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
a
delectable
finish
hints
of
peach
tea
cinnamon
other
tropical
fruits
but
grounded
so
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
check

been
craving

e
g
saison
dupont
has
this
beer
was
a
poor
excuse
for
a
saison
it
was
very
heavy
and
spiced
to
the
point
of
palate
shock
i
could
barely
get
through
it
if
it
wasnt
given
to
me
i
would
have
drain
poured
this
one
tastes
like
a
spicy

cheers
o
i
would
likely
rate
this
beer
a
bit
higher
if
it
involved
a

hop
bittering
and
a
bit
more
sourness
funkiness
as
it
stands
this
drinks
like
an
overhopped

pretty
good
saison
highly
complex
flavor
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
this
seems
much
more
like
some
sort
of
hefeweizenbelgian
pale
hybrid
than
a
saison
that
being
said
i
thought
it
was
excellent
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
i
think
the
scores
here
are
a
bit
lower
because
it
doesnt
fit
neatly
into
any
one
style
but
if
you
like
belgian
strong

youll
probably
enjoy
this

i
dont
need
my
beers
this
strong
unless
they
are
from
belgium
but
tasty
tasty
and
full
flavored

golden
color
with
lots
of
yeast
floating
around
aromas
of
yeast
and
spices
coriander
light
pepper
honeyed
malt
taste
follows
nose
with
an
edge
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
crisp
feel
and
a
slight
sickness
a
touch
heavy
easy
drinking
but
a
little
sharp
a
nice
beer
overall
on
cask
beautiful
beer
on
cask
pours
a
thin
head
that
goes
away
almost
immediately
lovely
amber
color
and
wellbalanced
refreshing
flavor
a
strong
yeasty
aroma
and
aftertaste
which
i
normally
do
not
like
but
i
can
tolerate
in
this
one
overall
a
nice
brew
that
goes
down
pretty
easily
o
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
but
i
would
definitely
have
liked
an
orange
component
to
the
flavor
this
was
one
i
have
wanted
to
try
for
a
while
really
great
pour
nice
amber
appearance
with
fluffy
bubbly
head
a
rather
simple
nose
spicy
belgian
yeast
and
a
bit
of
grainy
scent
the
flavor
is
rather
unique
as
opposed
to
other
saisons
i
have
had
similar
spicy
notes
including
coriander
and
pepper
a
really
strange
graininess
follows
like
a
hefeweizen
i
checked
the
description
and
found
that
they
do
use
wheat
so
i
guess
that
explains
the
graininess
last
is
the
nondescript
hop
bitterness
its
certainly
different
and
unlike
other
saisons
ive
had
overall
it
was
successful
for
me
maybe
not
the
best
in
the
class
but
certainly
interesting
poured
a
deeper
cloudy
gold
with
a
thinner
white
head
the
head
lingers
on
leaving
some
sticky
soapy
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
good
with
some
nice
deep
fruity
esters
and
hints
of
spices
the
taste
hits
it
just
right
with
some
notes
of
grain
banana
and
sugar
it
has
a
thinner
body
and
is
a
wellmade
saison
this
beer
is
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
score
it
highly
as
a
saison
while
i
like
the
banana
forward
flavor
i
feel
like
a
more
varied
yeast
profile
and
drier
finish
would
improve
it

o
good
though
a
little
too
hot
from
that
high
abv
and
the
slick
feel
doesnt
really
work
for
a
saison
not
the
greatest
saison
ive
had
but
it
is
drinkable
has
the
base
flavors
but
its
just
not
that
complex
might
be
picking
up
some
cinnamon
spice
otherwise
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
good
value
though
and
still
refreshing
a
bit
heavy
i
like
this
style
between
67
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
was
quite
a
saison
either
it
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
tripel
or
some
other
belgian
style
not
sorry
to
have
tried
it
but
probably
dont
need
to
buy
it
again
just
didnt
meet
the
truly
expectation
of
a
saison
o
this
saison
seems
to
be
a
little
heavier
in
body
compared
to
most
of
the
other
beers
ive
tried
in
the
style
possibly
due
to
its
use
of
candi
sugar
as
an
ingredient
overall
ive
had
better
but
i
find
this
to
be
an
easy
crisp
drinking
saison
that
fits
in
its
niche
overall
pretty
solid
saison
a
little
sweeter
than
most
but
still
enjoyable
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
for
the
most
part
however
ive
had
other
beers
that
i
much
preferred
to
this
one
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
but
could
be
somewhat
smoother
with
sour
beer
bubbles
my
sense
is
that
this
was
over
force
carbonated
o
this
was
the
first
saison
i
ever
had
and
had
turned
me
on
to
the
style
years
later
its
both
easy
to
see
what
i
liked
about
this
one
and
how
it
falls
short
of
the
standard
set
by
many
others
in
the
style
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
which
hides
its
alcohol
well
but
not
as
complex
or
yeast
driven
as
the
best
of
the
style
o
pleasant
and
drinkable
but
falls
far
short
of
the
benchmarks
of
the
style
dupont
sofie
etc
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
golden
orange
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
sweet
grain
and
belgian
yeast
tastes
of
sweet
berries
and
a
little
of
a
sweet
grain
carbonation
is
right
light
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
head
that
quickly
fades
to
the
beer
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
aromas
of
ripe
fruit
and
spice
taste
is
of
ripe
peaches
with
a
slightly
spicey
rum
alcohol
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
tasted
more
like
a
lighter
version
of
a
barley
wine
would
try
this
beer
again
more
of
a
typical
belgian
than
a
farmhouse
barnyard
saison
but
i
like
that
good
estery
yeast
character
that
dominates
and
lingers
pleasantly
surprised
but
its
not
to
style
i
have
to
give
this
one
bonus
points
in
the
overall
section
i
quite
like
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
i
just
feel
its
a
weak
representation
of
the
style
i
generally
find
that
american
saisons
are
average
at
best
in
this
category
tried
this
seasonal
brew
from
heavy
seas
this
weekend
i
will
not
rate
it
among
the
best
in
heavy
seas
lineup
but
still
it
was
not
disappointing
if
you
do
not
like
hoppy
beer
this
might
impress
you
taste
sweet
and
a
lot
of
fruits
7
5
alcohol
is
well
balanced
by
the
taste
overall
a
nice
beer
from
heavy
seas
good
taste
but
the
smell
was
not
up
to
par
and
kind
of
killed
it
for
me
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
buy
a
6pack
of
it
overall
this
is
a
very
good
saison
refreshing
with
a
very
good
saison
flavor
i
liked
it
very
much
o
look
its
not
really
a
bad
bspa
at
all
its
just
a
bad
saison
the
only
characteristic
heavy
seas
got
right
is
the
spice
flavor
and
thats
simply
too
mild
not
only
is
it
too
sweet
for
a
saison
its
too
sweet
for
a
regular
belgian
pale
ale
i
dont
plan
to
revisit
this
one
o
bad
saison
heavy
seas
would
be
better
off
with
a
redo
on
this
brew
o
a
tasty
beer
beverage
very
high
powered
single
finger
head
on
a
murky
golden
with
slight
amber
hues
body
excellent
retention
and
some
lacing
a
lot
of
musty
pale
malt
and
belgian
yeast
with
light
clove
and
little
in
the
way
of
citrus
flavor
is
good
but
not
great
keeping
it
simple
with
mild
lemon
tartness
hint
of
orange
peel
belgian
yeast
and
herbal
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
is
full
for
the
style
and
semi
dry
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
heavy
seas
makes
a
lot
of
easy
to
drink
beers
which
arent
bad
but
lack
creativity
overall
i
like
most
everything
i
have
had
i
just
wouldnt
call
many
of
their
beers
memorable
or
complex
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
balance
just
isnt
there
the
flavors
are
there
but
they
just
couldnt
hold
my
interest
in
the
end
there
are
better
saisons
out
there
but
this
is
worth
a
try
o
very
nice
i
really
enjoyed
this
though
i
think
it
would
have
been
improved
and
closer
to
style
if
it
was
drier
rather
than
fairly
sweet
still
out
of
the
heavy
seas
mixed
12pack
this
was
my
favorite
overall
a
great
representation
of
the
style
spicy
fruity
and
strong
just
wonderful
o
i
dont
know
what
they
were
going
for
but
they
missed
the
mark
another
big
disappointment
from
heavy
seas
overall
waaayyy
to
clean
for
a
saison
these
beers
shouldnt
be
headache
machines
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
should
ferment
them
through
in
the
low
60s
either
they
need
to
let
this
beer
develop
a
little
more
natural
complexity
before
it
can
compete
with
the
best
of
american
saisons
southampton
gi
etc
o
again
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
for
a
belgian
saison
i
would
definitely
drink
again
initially
server
a
little
too
cold
40f
once
it
warmed
up
it
was
much
more
smooth
in
the
taste
mouth
and
overall
o
i
love
this
recipe
the
candi
sugar
and
wheat
malts
take
this
beer
to
its
max
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
that
is
not
too
bitter
or
too
sweet
overall
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
was
a
summer
release
because
to
me
age
45
month
kept
it
the
same
if
not
improved
the
flavor
if
i
find
if
fresh
next
summer
i
will
have
to
compare
but
its
still
drinking
fantastic
o
nice
summer
beer
that
can
be
drunk
anytime
o
good
saison
accessible
to
novices
with
just
enough
odd
sourness
to
keep
it
interesting
drinkable
and
enjoyable
vaguely
recommended
have
had
several
so
probably
wont
have
again
o
not
my
favorite
saison
but
still
quite
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
spices
and
flavor
elements
although
something
is
missing
from
this
beer
that
holds
it
back
from
being
really
great
a
nice
beer
one
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
o
a
good
solid
beer
refreshing
and
interesting
i
would
buy
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
much
like
a
saison
more
like
a
light
tripel
i
like
my
saisons
with
a
peppery
bite
to
them
and
a
bit
dryer
than
this
beer
but
hey
whatever
it
is
its
pleasant
pours
golden
with
a
moderate
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
fairly
quickly
but
the
beer
puts
up
a
continuous
stream
of
bubbles
you
do
get
some
spice
and
pepper
in
the
aroma
followed
by
some
grassiness
and
sweetness
fairly
sweet
with
some
clove
notes
and
perhaps
even
a
little
banana
slightly
hot
in
the
mouth
but
otherwise
fairly
smooth
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
very
easy
to
drink
nice
flavor
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
fruit
stripe
gum
in
beer
form
this
is
something
i
would
definitely
drink
again
quite
drinkable
o
its
the
wrong
style
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
o
not
impressed
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
and
it
couldnt
stand
up
to
the
task
id
previously
had
this
on
cask
and
been
very
impressed
but
the
bottled
version
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
o
interesting
saison
brew
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
beer
had
7
5
abv
alcohol
was
brilliantly
masked
by
the
sweet
malt
cloudy
gold
in
appearance
has
a
nice
foam
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
good
to
average
the
feel
on
the
mouth
is
clean
with
very
little
lingering
nice
overall
taste
is
ok
there
is
a
spice
to
the
taste
not
for
everyone
overoverall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
that
goes
well
with
soft
pretzel
with
good
yellow
mustard
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
im
not
a
real
big
fan
of
saisons
to
begin
with
and
it
would
take
some
real
effort
to
drink
another
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
best
by
dec
2011
pours
orangish
golden
amber
color
with
12
fingers
of
a
fairly
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
fairly
thick
lacing
cap
a
small
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
dark
fruits
candi
sugar
banana
clove
spices
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
decent
and
interesting
aromas
here
with
good
strength
as
well
taste
of
lots
of
dark
fruits
clove
banana
molasses
bread
and
spices
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
alcohol
noticed
on
the
finish
fairly
dry
finish
but
there
are
a
bit
of
lingering
notes
of
dark
fruits
bread
molasses
and
spices
alcohol
is
slightly
present
in
the
taste
and
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
warming
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
despite
the
alcohol
presence
as
well
overall
this
is
a
solid
saison
that
is
like
a
wheat
beer
in
some
aspects
o
a
delicious
saison
true
to
form
id
have
another
one
o
i
felt
that
the
beer
was
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
but
somewhat
fell
flat
in
overall
complexity
the
pros
include
a
nice
spicy
refreshing
quality
cold
out
of
the
bottle
but
the
lack
of
depth
is
noticeable
still
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
at
7
99
a
sixer
i
cant
fault
the
price
point
for
a
saisonesque
brew
o
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
but
doubt
id
buy
it
again
o
a
great
local
and
affordable
saison
i
buy
this
every
time
its
out
o
a
saison
produced
in
baltimore
it
has
some
nice
lemon
sunshine
zing
and
great
carbonation
but
is
also
has
some
earthy
elements
the
alcohol
is
blended
well
and
the
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
balances
out
the
very
sweet
malt
opening
salvo
there
are
times
the
beer
feels
a
bit
watery
which
might
be
caused
by
the
high
level
of
carbonation
it
is
not
as
dry
as
a
saison
should
be
and
it
is
sweeter
as
well
the
beer
does
not
taste
bad
but
it
is
not
everything
the
style
should
be
either
overall
decent
i
admire
this
beer
for
having
a
different
flavor
then
most
saisons
ive
had
just
not
sure
id
want
this
flavor
all
the
time
good
fruit
presence
for
sure
but
the
sweetness
overpowers
the
beer
and
that
makes
it
a
little
unenjoyable
still
not
bad
and
worth
a
drink
saisons
are
dry
beers
and
this
beer
isnt
so
i
cant
justify
giving
it
a
decent
score
its
mediumbodied
for
the
style
perhaps
even
on
the
thicker
side
but
the
sweetness
and
wetness
does
the
beer
in
overall
this
is
a
curious
beer
that
doesnt
taste
poorly
but
also
doesnt
rate
highly
its
trying
to
be
a
saison
and
it
is
more
or
less
failing
at
it
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
about
this
beer
really
even
says
saison
as
with
all
their
beers
its
pretty
malty
ill
have
to
give
them
that
no
dry
mouthfeel
no
strong
belgian
yeast
taste
i
just
may
have
a
skunked
beer
has
a
diacatyl
taste
so
it
could
be
a
storage
issue
so
i
cant
exactly
give
them
an
f
but
ill
give
them
a
b
for
now
o
too
spicy
3
5
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
nice
flavor
it
isnt
my
favorite
saison
by
any
means
but
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
the
only
things
i
would
change
is
the
lingering
booziness
in
the
finish
and
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
bit
other
than
that
its
pretty
nice
i
think
its
worth
trying
o
im
a
big
fan
of
red
sky
at
night
and
i
was
really
happy
to
try
the
cask
version
with
this
medley
the
big
earthy
hop
resin
flavor
works
so
well
with
this
saisonjust
fantastic
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
in
any
version
easily
the
best
offering
from
heavy
seas
i
am
just
starting
to
get
into
the
saison
ales
and
this
is
my
second
behind
ithica
groundbreak
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
that
is
crystal
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
head
stays
as
more
of
a
thin
constant
layer
than
a
thick
foam
and
there
is
some
lacing
the
smell
reminds
me
of
some
american
wheat
yeast
strains
but
with
a
distinct
sour
aroma
almost
like
a
sauerkraut
thats
been
sweetened
the
yeast
strain
is
mellow
in
flavor
with
pepper
notes
and
a
continuation
of
the
sour
vibe
going
on
here
the
sour
mixes
with
a
mellow
bitterness
and
the
mouthfeel
is
alcohol
sweet
and
dry
a
great
edition
to
the
saison
arena
which
would
go
great
with
some
seafood
yum
od
an
easy
to
drink
saison
is
a
pretty
redundant
phrase
its
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
with
a
heavy
seas
higher
gravity
not
the
best
but
certainly
better
than
many
as
far
as
larger
produced
saisons
go
o
very
refreshing
beer
that
was
well
balanced
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
while
there
are
many
lovely
and
delightful
flavors
in
here
this
does
seem
like
a
featherweight
belgian
easy
on
the
tongue
and
not
as
nuanced
or
practiced
as
its
bigger
brothers
that
doesnt
mean
that
its
a
bad
beer
of
coursein
fact
its
very
drinkable
but
if
youre
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
this
is
not
going
to
add
anything
new
to
your
repertoire
overall
if
only
this
beer
produced
a
better
head
i
would
have
given
it
a
5
appearance
knocked
it
down
a
12
nocth
superb
brew
in
all
other
aspects
im
definitely
going
to
sample
some
more
saisons
if
this
is
what
they
are
like
beer
is
oddly
bitter
with
a
sweet
edge
to
it
the
yeast
character
is
really
strong
makes
the
beer
slightly
hard
to
drink
but
it
has
a
decent
finish
a
little
too
dry
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
the
taste
is
spicy
with
pleasant
herbal
hops
a
light
fruity
backbone
and
slightly
too
much
booze
the
spicy
character
is
its
best
asset
but
about
halfway
through
the
beer
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
takes
over
and
covers
up
some
of
the
complexities
that
this
beer
exhibited
in
the
first
sip
the
herbal
hops
are
still
there
however
and
provide
a
solid
taste
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
not
being
crisp
or
creamy
dry
in
the
finish
though
all
around
this
is
a
just
a
decent
beer
a
couple
things
could
probably
be
improved
but
still
a
decent
drink
o
a
solid
saison
that
comes
in
a
sixer
what
could
be
better
very
tasty
and
worth
seekin
out
if
you
like
saisons
drinkability
has
all
the
elements
of
the
saison
style
adequate
abv
quality
ingredients
and
character
not
too
intense
which
makes
it
a
good
drinkable
beer
the
aroma
was
charged
with
spice
it
was
so
carbonated
it
was
literally
tickling
my
nose
as
it
went
by
lots
of
light
fruit
grain
touches
of
grass
and
peppery
like
notes
along
with
a
touch
of
sour
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
and
was
very
nicely
done
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
here
rather
a
finely
blended
and
very
light
and
airy
feel
to
it
sloshing
it
around
created
that
coveted
silky
feeling
of
foam
in
the
mouth
this
was
very
good
lots
of
light
citrus
flavors
bouncing
around
and
a
very
dry
finish
a
touch
sour
but
not
really
very
earthy
in
nature
and
yet
very
light
with
a
nice
light
grain
base
and
a
wonderful
champagne
like
finish
has
some
sweetness
to
it
which
is
odd
for
a
saison
i
dont
really
find
this
beer
to
be
a
traditional
saison
brew
this
beer
was
on
the
cloudy
yellow
colored
side
has
a
pretty
good
head
that
sticks
around
till
the
end
the
beers
sweetness
kinda
turned
me
off
from
this
brew
to
me
a
saison
should
be
more
earthy
or
funky
but
this
one
just
didnt
have
that
purchase
before
september
2010
date
on
bottle
served
from
bottle
into
a
the
bruery
tulip
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
and
subtle
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
massive
banana
very
subtle
spices
and
a
big
sweet
followthrough
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
wasnt
too
bad
if
im
honest
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
it
came
out
nicely
had
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
going
on
in
this
one
with
a
good
aroma
as
well
not
sure
why
the
reviews
are
so
low
on
this
one
but
i
found
it
to
be
quite
nice
and
have
robust
flavors
in
all
the
right
places
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
and
i
usually
hate
saisons
as
many
flaws
as
i
did
find
with
this
beer
its
still
a
pretty
good
deal
at
roughly
86pack
im
generally
not
one
for
taking
style
into
consideration
when
reviewing
a
beer
but
this
one
improves
drastically
when
you
stop
expecting
a
saison
expect
a
slightly
aboveaverage
hefeweizen
or
american
wheat
and
youll
be
pleasantly
surprised
from
their
heavy
seas
line
its
heavy
seas
that
separate
the
men
from
the
boys
clipper
citys
red
sky
at
night
pours
a
daytime
sunny
yellow
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
decent
head
and
limited
lacing
the
smell
is
belgium
sweet
some
citrus
some
spice
but
noting
overpowering
or
noticeable
the
taste
is
good
for
a
saison
which
makes
it
much
easier
to
drink
a
sweet
malt
that
has
medium
complexity
and
sweet
candy
and
a
slight
peppery
aftertaste
are
good
the
yeast
brings
a
tanginess
and
a
citrus
like
taste
to
it
its
surprising
to
see
that
this
is
a
8
abv
no
really
phenol
smells
or
tastes
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
starting
saisons
although
i
think
there
could
be
more
taste
more
fruitiness
to
bring
out
more
of
the
styl
d
o
k
served
in
a
tulip
appearance
is
a
mild
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
a
good
deal
of
lacing
nose
is
subtle
fruit
plus
some
grain
and
spice
taste
has
a
bit
of
spice
but
is
a
bit
lacking
good
feel
with
some
light
pepper
drinks
okay
but
is
not
offering
enough
to
be
better
than
just
a
bit
better
than
good
a
golden
amber
ale
which
leaves
a
mere
14
inch
of
white
head
and
minimal
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
yeasty
some
bread
and
spicy
notes
as
well
as
citrus
and
sweet
malts
sweet
upfront
with
some
spiciness
coming
through
in
the
back
quite
malty
and
sugary
and
hot
really
not
sure
what
is
going
on
with
this
saison
certainly
different
but
not
in
a
good
way
medium
bodied
dry
and
hot
not
all
that
drinkable
either
not
a
beer
i
would
revisit
average
at
best
d
ok
for
this
style
it
was
more
sour
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
it
was
still
a
decent
saison
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
though
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
still
i
liked
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
clipper
city
as
they
seem
to
put
out
some
pretty
solid
stuff
d
okay
not
the
best
saison
ever
but
its
drinkable
very
drinkable
7

and
you
dont
taste
the
alcohol
wow
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
lemon

color
and
semitransparent
nice
white
head
with
good
retention
and

overall
wellrounded
alcohol
gets
involved
with
a
mild
bite
mediumbodied
brew
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
little
drying
on
the
palate
due
to
the
hops
also
leaves
a
sticky
sweetness
on
the
lips
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
and
the
7

alcohol
is
deceiving
overall
a
refreshing
and
well
rounded
saison
md
it
has
a
rich
mouthfeel
a
tad
creaminess
to
it
maybe
a
syrupy
quality
but
overall
a
good
saison
d
this
is
a
decent
saison
but
i
think
the
body
weighs
it
down
a
bit
for
drinkability
when
compared
to
others
in
the
style
mouthfeel
aside
its
a
fairly
tasty
beer
with
some
interesting
character
i
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
but
i
sure
wouldnt
be
disappointed
with
another
opportunity
to
have
one

expand

for

hits

white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
with
a
fruity
background
the
taste
is
earthy
and
fruity
with
an
ever
so
slight
lemony
zest
there
are
spicy
peppery
notes
at
the
finish
the
flavor
lingers
pleasantly
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
very
light
carbonation
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
given
the
opportunity
i
will
definetly
drink
more
in
the
future
tmd
a
little
crisp
pilsner
maltiness
softened
by
intensified
bubblegum
esters
the
pineapple
is
a
bit
more
subdued
but
still
noticeable
incredibly
refreshing
some
definite
grassiness
that
comes
in
with
the
white
pepper
midpalate
and
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
a
tad
light
on
the
carbonation
for
the
style
but
its
fine
with
me
i
prefer
just
a
little
more
but
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
the
huge
champagnelike
carbonation
pretty
good
stuff
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
flavor
that
was
mellow
and
would
go
with
a
lot
of
foods
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
while
having
a
burger
with
the
guys
or
just
enjoying
some
cheese
and
sausage
during
a
game
d
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
i
like
this
one
as
i
did
there
abbey
ale
offering
appearance
for
this
beer
is
gorgeous
gold
color
with
a
gold
tinted
foam
smell
is
of
complicated
swirls
of
fruits
taste
is
almost
like
nectarines
or
pear
with
a
wheaty
finish
the
beer
is
remarkably
smooth
and
there
isnt
much
notice
of
carbanation
or
alcohol
burn
yet
another
really
good
offering
from
clipper
city
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
yellow
orange
color
with
a
very
small
head
formed
the
lacing
is
non
existent
and
the
retention
fades
with
seconds
looks
under
carbonated
the
aroma
is
fantastic
real
belgian
fruity
spicy
yeasty
aromas
typical
of
saisons
also
has
a
white
pepper
spiciness
to
it
the
flavor
is
great
too
really
dry
spicy
and
floral
at
the
same
time
leaves
the
tongue
very
dry
and
tingly
has
a
spicy
jalapeño
pepper
spiciness
to
it
topped
with
white
pepper
and
oranges
the
mouthfeel
isnt
very
good
as
its
under
carbonated
full
bodied
saison
too
which
really
offsets
the
style
drinkability
is
fair
as
its
probably
better
with
food
considering
the
lack
of
bubbles
d
i
could
have
more
of
this
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
however
if
i
bought
another
sampler
from
clipper
city
brewing
i
would
defiantly
have
this
pours
clear
copper
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
conventional
with
some
light
brown
sugar
and
toast
the
aroma
is
malty
and
tealike
with
a
mouth
puckering
tannic
bitterness
the
flavor
has
toffee
and
brown
sugar
and
a
deeper
hop
bitterness
behind
it
the
mouthfeel
is
tingly
and
very
dry
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
and
just
a
bit
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruit
and
bready
malts
body
is
light
to
medium
crispwith
some
carbonation
taste
is
of
sweet
bread
and
fruittangy
finish
veryvery
nice
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
its
still
very
dry
im
not
crazy
about
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
golden
orange
with
one
finger
of
white
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
great
citrus
lemon
and
apricot
nose
with
spice
and
brett
funk
the
taste
revealed
some
berry
flavor
as
well
mixed
with
spice
and
citrus
and
finished
on
a
modest
spicepeel
note
light
to
mediumbodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
refreshing
alternative
for
the
summer
months
d
not
impressed
this
is
definitely
a
case
where
the
sweetness
and
possibly
the
abv
is
wayyy
out
of
scale
not
only
in
the
beer
in
question
but
also
the
style
i
sure
would
hate
to
be
laboring
outdoors
with
this
as
a
refreshment
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
tart
malt
yeast
pale
hop
hint
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
saison
farmhouse
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
alcohol
tart
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hop
slight
citrus
and
a
hint
of
yeast
overall
good
aroma
and
blend
but
lacking
in
body
heavy
seas
makes
some
nice
brews
and
this
is
no
exception
something
to
be
proud
of
overall
had
this
twice
now
dont
think
i
will
revisit
ever
again
d
ummm
this
at
best
this
is
a
mediocre
hefe
certainly
doesnt
have
any
of
the
good
saison
qualities
too
sweet
and
not
nearly
refreshing
enough
ill
pass
this
is
not
a
true
saison
per
se
but
more
of
an
american
interpretation
the
addition
of
candi
sugar
makes
this
one
a
lot
more
sugary
than
the
typical
dry
stylized
saison
nonetheless
this
makes
a
fine
belgian
gold
ale
which
would
border
a
triple
in
some
folks
books
refreshing
delicious
and
mildly
warming
ill
have
to
save
a
few
of
these
for
aging
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
not
as
spicyinteresting
as
other
american
takes
on
the
style
but
still
a
tasty
and
clean
doesnt
overreach
on
the
yeast
saison
i
really
like
this
ale
i
think
it
is
perfect
summer
to
hell
with
your
basic
summer
wheat
with
a
ton
of
citrus
thrown
in
this
beats
them
in
taste
complexity
and
for
me
price
im
thinking
that
this
would
be
a
great
breakfast
beer
with
a
quiche
using
swiss
or
fontiago
cheese
excellent
brew
dthis
is
a
pretty
tasty
saison
with
some
interesting
things
happening
the
champagne
flavors
are
interesting
the
wild
yeast
has
definitely
added
something
to
this
nice
brew
golden
amber
with
a
small
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
lots
of
fruit
spices
and
nuttiness
the
taste
is
rich
of
cherry
and
hazelnut
cant
taste
much
alcohol
which
is
surprising
for
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
8
abv
average
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
definitely
recommend
it
drinkability
full
flavored
and
good
for
sipping
decent
attempt
at
a
belgian
beer
notes
while
not
too
remarkable
it
feels
pretty
good
and
it
is
reliable
if
anything
the
first
thing
that
one
misses
is
that
while
seemingly
bottle
conditioned
it
feels
somewhat
filtered
and
one
longs
for
a
bit
of
a
stronger
hazyyeasty
touch
on
the
palate
always
suhin
good
on
cask
over
at
the
ck
this
nice
lil
bit
o
maryland
saison
pours
a
thoroughly
cloudy
grapefruit
yellow
with
a
small
bubbly
head
not
to
cast
aspersions
on
things
but
it
looks
as
though
some
beastly
urine
is
sitting
in
my
glass
yeah
interestingly
i
still
really
wanna
drink
it
the
smell
helps
dig
me
out
of
this
grave
lemon
rind
coriander
wheat
fields
and
mandarin
oranges
comprise
a
zesty
whiff
nice
but
lacking
that
hint
o
funk
that
keeps
a
certain
mr
clinton
in
business
i
mean
seriously
did
you
see
him
on
arsenio
back
in
92
rockin
that
sax
no
wonder
that
elder
shrub
got
clocked
things
stay
pretty
much
unchanged
when
smell
becomes
taste
synesthesia
not
included
though
some
cardamom
and
oj
pulp
so
long
as
its
not
in
my
juice
im
fine
join
in
the
fun
as
well
in
sum
a
melange
o
summery
tastiness
light
in
body
and
carbonation
heavy
on
righteousness
something
like
that
after
seeing
this
brew
in
bottles
at
several
stores
its
nice
to
finally
put
a
face
to
the
brown
glass
especially
in
caskconditioned
form
get
some
strong
citrusy
nose
incredibly
well
bodied
i
like
this
one
very
cold
d
id
have
another
glass
while
sitting
on
my
patio
on
a
warm
day
the
way
this
drinks
makes
it
very
sessionable
although
it
doesnt
pack
the
huge
flavor
punch
or
funkness
of
other
saisons
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
retain
very
well
the
aroma
has
some
hay
and
a
little
funk
upfront
along
with
notes
of
pear
and
green
apple
esters
biscuit
corriander
white
pepper
and
a
little
honey
the
flavor
is
fruity
initially
with
notes
of
green
apples
pears
and
honeydew
melon
as
well
as
some
biscuit
and
hay
funky
yeast
corriander
and
white
peppercorn
a
little
honey
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sprightly
and
drinkability
is
excellent
very
solid
saison
here
especially
for
the
price
had
to
bump
up
the
drinkability
a
little
because
of
my
desire
to
drink
another
one
of
these
on
the
spot
hazy
golden
in
color
aroma
is
the
expected
farmhouse
scent
bready
yeasty
barnfunk
yeastiness
and
astringency
at
first
sip
tasting
some
wheat
flavor
as
well
oily
and
mouthcoating
quite
refreshing
overall
a
fine
summer
sipper
hits
you
with
a
half
finger
of
bone
white
head
which
is
shortlived
settles
into
a
few
scattered
islands
across
the
surface
curiously
more
stickiness
to
the
lacing
then
first
expected
visually
as
much
dilute
orange
as
stronger
yellow
excellent
clarity
and
in
spite
of
the
weak
hue
has
a
glow
which
pleases
the
eye
the
nose
has
an
outdoorsy
natural
character
you
almost
expect
to
drink
it
on
an
actual
farm
big
time
clove
cinnamon
spiced
orange
and
something
like
mulled
cider
country
style
rye
breadiness
the
apple
pear
apricot
fruit
stays
within
itself
even
though
the
spiciness
wants
to
tease
out
more
tropical
fruit
nuances
waft
of
banana
fullbodied
for
the
style
hugs
the
curves
of
your
mouth
strikes
a
good
balance
between
sweet
and
spicy
all
that
clove
coriander
ginger
sweeps
through
lees
and
raw
bread
dough
white
pepper
then
white
grape
banana
peach
pear
cherry
apricot
fruit
the
carbonation
perhaps
adds
too
much
fluff
factor
the
lemon
orange
citrus
a
steadying
influence
throughout
finish
is
sort
of
short
but
mouth
perfume
full
enough
to
compensate
nicely
drinkable
had
this
brew
first
time
on
tap
at
capones
norristown
it
was
poured
into
a
chalice
it
appeared
to
have
a
nice
amber
gold
color
smell
was
lacking
only
slight
yeast
and
spice
the
taste
was
a
great
suprise
not
a
traditional
saison
by
any
means
but
a
pleasant
escape
this
ale
is
very
sweet
and
has
a
almost
bubblegum
spice
flavor
to
it
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
red
sky
at
night
is
very
smooth
with
subtle
carbanation
allowing
it
to
glide
across
your
taste
buds
nicely
this
is
such
a
unique
brew
i
bought
a
sixer
of
it
to
go
at
the
end
of
the
night
the
8
abv
is
so
well
hidden
that
it
is
scary
very
nicely
done
im
really
surprised
that
the
average
is
so
low
on
this
for
the
style
it
is
excellent
and
very
similar
to
hennepin
probably
a
bit
sweeter
but
very
good
defintely
worth
a
try
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
maybe
im
just
used
to
drinking
the
phenomenal
examples
of
saisons
by
comparison
i
find
this
one
a
bit
dull
and
lifeless
the
spiciness
is
good
but
there
is
a
drying
off
flavor
in
there
that
is
spoiling
it
for
me
the
fruity
and
spicy
flavors
dont
have
a
chance
to
shine
seems
to
bring
out
the
malt
more
and
dry
things
out
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
more
of
these
out
soon
overall
a
decent
beer
but
uncomplex
and
not
really
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
drinkabilitythis
is
my
favorite
of
the
heavy
seas
line
up
i
love
the
sweet
apple
taste
which
is
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
want
to
buy
a
six
as
the
abv
is
well
masked
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
heavy
seas
lineup
im
not
sure
this
would
be
considered
a
classic
saison
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
with
a
nice
balance
between
candy
sugar
and
tart
notes
surpisingly
drinkable
for
the
relatively
high
abv
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
might
have
been
my
favorite
out
of
the
cc
mix
pack
i
got
this
is
one
i
will
buy
again
my
first
time
ever
trying
a
belgian
saisonfarmhouse
ale
i
was
very
much
impressed
with
ccs
offering
poured
cloudy
like
a
wheat
beer
with
very
minimal
head
incredibly
this
beer
smelled
like
candy
the
sweetness
is
because
of
the
belgian
candi
sugar
that
is
used
in
making
high
alcohol
beers
to
avoid
creating
a
thick
body
the
scent
took
me
back
to
childhood
but
i
couldnt
put
a
finger
on
what
treat
it
reminds
me
of
the
taste
is
of
citrus
wheat
with
a
little
alcohol
bite
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
the
drinkability
was
fair
as
well
overall
i
discovered
this
interpretation
of
the
farmhouse
style
to
be
satisfying
i
plan
to
try
some
more
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
of
an
underrepresented
style
breaks
a
bit
from
the
norm
and
thats
a
good
thing
drinkability
an
impressive
beer
and
an
interesting
style
very
complex
and
certainly
worth
a
try
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
however
it
didnt
quite
have
enough
bite
to
be
a
very
good
saison
worth
a
shot
to
decide
for
yourself
review
from
notes
taken
on
72709
moreys
bottom
line
not
a
bad
saison
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
my
favorite
style
but
well
done
none
the
less
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
have
had
more
than
one
on
multiple
occasions
despite
the
high
alcohol
poured
a
pale
orange
with
onefinger
head
and
minimal
lace
a
nice
tart
apple
and
pear
fruit
smell
as
some
clove
and
pepper
spices
a
sharp
tart
fruit
taste
that
is
tucked
in
a
light
body
that
passes
over
smooth
fruit
flavors
while
mild
include
apple
pear
and
some
tropical
fruit
a
little
clove
and
pepper
as
well
as
minor
sweetness
from
a
little
bit
of
caramel
malt
while
a
basic
saison
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
quaffable
overall
my
wife
and
i
both
really
enjoy
the
flavor
and
experience
of
this
beer
the
best
offering
from
heavy
seas
so
far
not
my
typical
choice
in
beer
but
it
is
still
a
good
drinkability
sour
but
refreshing
a
really
nice
higher
gravity
saison
ale
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hints
of
yeast
and
cloves
taste
is
good
yeast
and
cloves
are
there
as
well
as
fruit
and
alcohol
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
good
intro
to
the
style
albiet
not
the
best
saison
a
good
seasonal
from
heavy
seas
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
overall
ill
give
it
a
drinkable
meh
overall
as
a
seasonal
clipper
city
brew
i
wont
be
drinking
this
all
summer
but
i
will
definitely
pick
up
at
least
two
sixers
to
bookend
the
season
in
the
future

all

a

show
pours
a
slightly

with
a

that

into
a

the

is
of

some

bubble
gum
and
banana
flavors
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
with
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
this
is
a
pretty
good
bpabspa
but
the
problem
is
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
saison
the
brew
does
not
have
many
of
the
saison
characteristics
no
hay
horse
blanket
or
other
farmhouse
funk
i
needed
to
rate
it
as
a
saison
so
it
go
lower
marks
but
if
it
were
labeled
as
a
bpabspa
my
grade
would
go
up
considerably
oh
well
still
an
enjoyable
beer
medium
in
body
with
some
substance
highly
viscous
nice
sipper
on
a
crazy
cool
july
afternoon
overall
somewhat
refreshing
and
satisfactorily
complex
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
i
wasnt
blown
away
drinkability
at
best
a
marginally
passable
though
not
standout
saison
it
has
a
higher
abv
going
for
it
if
thats
your
thing
but
if
that
is
your
thing
why
not
opt
for
a
fantome
as
they
do
have
some
more
boozy
saison
offerings
hv
cheers
overall
quite
delicious
and
drinkable
thanks
to
its
light
dry
puckery
character
but
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
certainly
manifests
itself
after
the
beer
is
finished
diminishing
drinkability
a
bit
definitely
a
nice
summer
offering
that
fits
in
with
the
typical
wheat
beer
seasonals
while
breaking
the
mold
at
the
same
time
is
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
creamy
and
not
so
light
like
many
others
of
the
style
are
although
this
is
spot
on
for
the
style
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the

the
beer
is
decent
and
drinkable
it
just
seems
like
it
is
missing
something
as
far
as
taste
goes
decent
brew
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
very
clean
finish
no
aftertaste
at
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
except
it
will
knock
you
on
your
butt
from
the
alcohol
content
which
is
not
noticeable
at
all
while
drinking
will
definitely
get
this
again
thoughvery
tasty
this
is
the
first
saison
ive
reviewed
and
while
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
this
style
i
must
say
the
flavor
profile
and
the
belgian
yeast
quite
suits
my
taste
enjoyable
and
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
heavy
seas
series
from
clipper
city
is
quite
reasonably
priced
definitely
a
beer
to
check
out
d
the
heavy
seas
series
hasnt
done
much
for
me
and
this
did
nothing
to
elevate
my
opinion
of
the
series
in
fact
it
was
so
boring
i
had
to
do
a
drain
pour
relatively
dry
warm
alcohol
similar
to
the
smell
in
that
there
is
a
sour
finish
not
as
flavorful
as
most
saisons
in
fact
its
pretty
runofthemill
d
you
can
tell
the
alc
content
on
this
is
up
there
i
could
have
a
few
but
id
probably
regret
it
later
smooth
flavor
and
mouthfeel
reminds
me
of
a
carbonated
juice
very
sweet
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
appropriately
i
have
had
most
of
the
heavy
seas
collection
and
i
must
say
they
are
quite
tasty
this
ones
a
good
one
to
try
though
the
sneaky
abv
limits
the
drinkability
just
a
bit
its
brewed
well
enough
to
interest
me
in
trying
more
from
clipper
city
a
light
clear
orange
yellow
pour
with
a
big

while
the

i
can
definitely
see
this
being
a
pleasant
beer
to
slug
back
all
day
and
all
night
something
to
buy
a
case
of
for
a
picnic
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
of
foamy
off
white
head
decent
head
retention
leaving
thick
yet
spotty

a

up

with
a
definite
yeast
flavoring
and
a
good
deal
of
wheat
in

then
becomes
a

sweeter
some
banana
sugar

and
a

this
is

drinkable

d
light

decent
though
quickly
fading
carbonation
very
drinkable
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
the
price
8
sixers
but
the
beer
doesnt
bring
all
the
flavors
to
the
table
or
anything
new
d
this
is
a
wonderful
saison
that
ill
be
returning
to
again
and
again
its
brews
like
this
that
convince
me
never
to
move
out
of
maryland
for
some
reason
all
of
these
features
combine
into
a
very
drinkable
package
another
nice
offering
from
clipper
citys
heavy
seas
line
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
this
saison
had
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
that
went
into
a
small
cap
not
much
lacing
smells
like
a
basket
of
fruit
with
apple
and
pear
some
belgian
yeast
and
slight
hops
getting
the
same
fruits
in
the
taste
also
with
some
yeast
and
also
bubblegum
and
candy
a
step
above
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
feel
i
could
go
for
this
again
edit
just
read
on
the
neck
label
its
a
belgian
farmhouse
ale
brewed
with
belgian
yeast
and
candy
sugars
nice
im
digging
it
very
creamy
with
only
limited
carbonation
prickliness
medium
to
full
in
body
it
feels
a
bit
heavy
for
a
saison
to
me
there
was
little
to
no
head
on
this
beer
and
not
much
carbonation
however
i
have
had
this
in
my
fridge
for
a
little
while
golden
hazy
appearance
fruity
and
yeasty
smells
on
first
pour
taste
of
spice
pepper
and
fruit
has
somewhat
of
a
belgian
quality
to
it
overall
a
pretty
good
saison
di
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
this
would
pair
well
with
a
spicy
thaichineseasian
dish
note
had
this
beer
on
cask
again
the
other
night
at
maxs
61209
so
maybe
that
indicates
they
will
continue
to
make
this
version
i
hope
so
the
red
sky
at
night
made
with
spices
version
is
just
terrific
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
glass
this
beer
pours
a
shade
or
two
lighter
then
straw
with
just
a
speck
of
a
white
head
that
leaves
just
an
inkling
of
lacing
i
wish
this
beer
had
a
better
head
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
typical
of
a
saison
belgian
candy
sugar
clove
orange
zest
pepper
and
big
fluffy
grans
biscuits
the
flavor
comes
across
as
spicy
big
clove
notes
cardamom
huge
pineapple
citrus
and
white
pepper
mixed
all
together
in
a
doughy
bread
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
bodied
but
finishes
at
about
a
perfect
level
of
dryness
this
is
a
really
approachable
saison
im
really
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
the
spice
and
apple
come
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
easy
to
drink
and
quite
crisp
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
simple
session
beer
a
nice
take
on
a
saison
not
a
traditional
saison
but
close
and
worth
it
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
but
i
could
also
see
it
being
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
i
guess
it
would
depend
what
kind
of
a
mood
i
was
in
not
a
bad
beer
though
clipper
city
delivers
pretty
well
goes
down
smoothly
d
very
impressed
by
this
one
i
like
what
clipper
city
does
with
its
heavy
seas
line
a
robust
adventurous
line
of
beers
with
an
extremely
reasonable
price
tag
this
is
the
standout
of
the
heavy
seas
line
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
very
sweet
possibly
a
litte
overly
sweet
it
destroys
the
subtle
flavors
that
i
associate
with
a
saison
overall
its
a
very
inexpensive
beer
with
a
deceptive
alcohol
content
that
i
could
drink
almost
any
day
i
think
that
clipper
city
should
make
this
a
regular
heavy
seas
offering
as
its
waaaayy
better
than
the
uber
pils
buy
this
now
buy
it
often
saison
copies
should
follow
this
beer
will
be
in
heavy
rotation
throughout
the
season
for
sure
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
for
an
easy
saturday
afternoon
good
flavors
this
one
is
a
pleasant
surprise
if
you
are
looking
for
a
saison
with
a
bit
more
kick
than
most
i
think
this
might
be
the
right
one
for
you
enjoyable
drinkability
tastes
good
relatively
high
abv
might
prevent
me
from
indulging
more
but
i
would
be
able
to
have
a
couple
of
these
with
no
problem
recommended
drinkability
very
drinkable
though
a
little
sweet
which
limits
the
sessionability
alcohol
is
very
wellmasked

d
this
is
a
good
beer
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
d
a
nice
flavorful
saison
with
a
great
aroma
it
looks
like
shit
but
makes
up
for
it
with
a
great
yeast
character
the
only
flavor
flaw
is
the
slightly
unpleasant
phenolic
character
in
finish
for
some
reason
i
have
neglected
the
clipper
city
beers
up
to
this
point
but
after
trying
this
one
ill
have
to
give
them
some
more
attention
this
is
a
strange
beer
its
better
than
the
scores
i
gave
it
light
honey
blonde
with
a
fluffy
fine
white
head
that
leaves
beautiful
fine
lace
on
the
glass

of
suspended
yeast
particles

and
apple

to
mind

mild
and

nice
funky

dry

quaffable
for
the
style
original
notes
from
101104
with
additions
from
the

over

my
first
stab
at
this
style
a
little
odd
if
you
ask
me
tastes
very
belgianlike
to
me
reminds
me
a
lot
of
all
the
unibroue
beers
i
tried
weird
appearance
to
it
light
orangeyellow
color
with
lots
of
floating
sediment
but
the
sediment
doesnt
move
at
all
and
just
hangs
motionless
suspended
very
spicy
smell
and
taste
to
it
one
of
the
spiciest
beers
ive
ever
tried
really
while
i
cant
say
it
goes
down
smooth
exactly
for
8
abv
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
at
all
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
sure
if
this
style
is
for
me
poured
a
golden
amber
from
a
12
oz
bottle
lively
head
forms
quickly
but
dissipates
quickly
leaves
minimal
lacing
down
the
glass
much
yeast
floating
in
the
glass
more
than
most
smelled
more
of
grass
fruits
hops
but
some
sourness
as
well
taste
was
nice
but
more
sour
than
what
i
look
for
in
a
saison
taste
i
found
very
similar
to
the
fantome
variety
more
than
the
dupont
variety
mouthfeel
was
average
drinkablity
for
me
is
limited
as
i
prefer
my
saisons
a
little
drier
and
less

than
this
one
tastes
of
mild

my
first

im
all

with

very

would
definitely
recommend

i
just
dont
think
the

is
for
me
i
did
not
get
any
enjoyment
from
this
beer
just
not
my
taste
i
guess
i
would
not
try
this
one
again
d
pretty
strong
showing
this
is
one
multifaceted
and
tasty
brew
which
keeps
me
coming
back
for
the
positive
reward
d
looks
and
smells
good
and
tastes
pretty
decent
too
however
the
flabby
mouthfeel
and
crummy
finish
make
this
one
fall
apart
in
fairness
i
will
give
this
one
another
try
maybe
my
bottle
was
just
a
dud
its
a
good
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
i
do
like
the
heavy
seas
line
of
beers
in
general
if
my
next
red
sky
at
night
experience
is
great
ill
gladly
change
my
review
in
accordance
buy
this
beer
and
love
it
while
you
can
its
unique
and
delicious
lightly
hazed
and
a
bright
yellow
with
a
thin
ring
and
skim
of
white
bubbles
after
the
fizzy
cap
settled
nice
aroma
spicy
up
front
with
cereal
grain
and
lemon
a
little
floral
and
fruity
too
mild
bitterness
with
fruit
and
spice
throughout
some
citrus
zest
slight
banana
and
higher
alcohol
character
as
it
warmed
but
not
enough
to
throw
it
out
of
balance
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
very
smooth
texture
with
a
bit
of
dryness
at
the
end
pretty
tasty
a
nice
summertime
beer
that
hits
the
spot
after
a
long
run
or
some
outside
labor
this
one
isnt
as
rich
as
a
belgian
ale
but
has
a
lot
of
the
same
characteristics
quite
refreshing
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
a
good
balance
of
malts
to
hops
to
fruitiness
and
a
nice
semi
sweet
slightly
dry
finish
d
i
was
hoping
as
this
warmed
a
setled
on
my
pallate
that
it
would
get
better
and
it
actually
has
a
tiny
bit
but
not
as
much
as
i
was
hoping
a
really
good
beer
though
try
her
on
for
size
shell
fit
nicely
bottle
marked
to
be
consumed
by

smells
like
a
fruit
bouquet
of
cherry
and
maracuya
with
hints
of
mango
and
plum
and
of
course
yeast
pours
to
a
cloudy
golden
red
with
lots
of
structure
taste
is
slighty
acidic
sweet
yet
sour
with
a
good
hearty
mouthfeel
om
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
my
guess
due
to
the
ac
the
finish
taste
is
is
spicy
and
slighly
bitter
overall
it
leaves
a
fruity
taste
lingering
complex
and
hearty
a
good
offering
i
like
this
beer
it
is
different
from
the
traditional
saisons
but
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
golden
colored
relatively
thick
white

sweet
fruity
vanilla
yeasty
aroma
fairly
strong
vanilla
cream
and
banana
flavors
in
the
taste
with
a
sharp
alcohol
note
in
there
a
fullbodied
refreshing
type
of
summer
beer
although
the
abv
in
this
limits
that
a
bit
44434
d
a
decent
saison
even
if
a
little
heavy
overall
this
beer
is
more
tripely
than
saisony
its
very
good
and
i
would
have
scored
it
higher
if
the
label
stated
tripel
but
based
on
the
saison
nameplate
i
gave
it
this
less
enthusiastic
review
my
least
favorite
so
far
from
the
heavy
seas
lineup
but
really
all
of
them
have
been
good
beers
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
good
head
nice
lacing
and
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
very
nice
scent
some
clove
tones
and
a
nice
maltiness
along
with
a
slight
pepper
aroma
excellent
taste
some
nice
banana
and
clove
tones
along
with
a
fantastic
honey
flavor
with
a
nice
spicy
ending
very
well
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
goes
down
quite
well
for
a
higher
abv
with
just
a
bit
of
roughness
from
the
carbonation
nicely
done
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
i
think
it
was
ok
for
a
saison
beer
this
is
another
relatively
good
beer
in
the
heavy
seas
line
but
line
the
other
nonhoppy
beers
this
one
could
use
some
refinement
to
sharpen
the
flavors
and
increase
the
complexity
what
you
do
get
here
is
a
creamy
assortment
of
farmhouse
spices
fruity
beligan
esters
and
touch
of
light
malt
flavor
so
all
in
all
a
tasty
brew
it
does
sit
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
and
isnt
nearly
as
refreshing
as
other
saisons
like
dupont
still
worth
a
try
though
for
something
different
d
much
better
examples
out
there
and
honestly
not
worth
the
price
of
a
6
pack
and
only
barely
worth
the
price
of
a
loosie
overall
less
then
moderate
drinkability
and
enjoyment
i
got
3
bottles
of
this
from
a
gift
membership
to
the
microbrew
of
the
month
club
as
the
weather
begins
to
gradually
become
warmer
i
find
myself
looking
for
those
special
spring
time
seasonal
beers
i
came
across
this
saison
at
my
favorite
shop
eager
for
something
that
cried
sunshine
i
quickly
grabbed
a
sixer
poured
a
very
colorful
light
orange
almost
copper
color
into
my
glass
the
steady
carbonation
quickly
produced
a
thick
creamy
head
the
lacing
is
moderate
and
the
head
soon
diminished
to
a
thin
yet
creamy
layer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
presence
of
the
lacing
and
head
considering
the
higher
alcohol
content
as
this
beer
warmed
up
a
bit
the
aroma
really
took
off
a
mixture
of
semisweet
malts
and
hoppy
bitterness
dominate
the
overall
scent
which
is
accented
with
an
earthy
affect
that
i
found
extremely
appealing
the
flavor
is
right
in
line
with
the
aromas
that
are
given
off
malty
and
considerably
hoppy
the
flavor
is
complex
at
first
but
gives
way
to
a
simplicity
that
is
difficult
to
explain
there
is
a
peppery
flavor
that
seems
to
lead
to
hints
of
citrus
and
cloves
the
mouthfeel
is
fresh
the
malts
create
a
smooth
finish
that
is
surprisingly
full
i
really
started
to
enjoy
this
saison
once
it
warmed
up
a
bit
the
high
abv
only
made
its
presence
known
as
i
exhaled
a
real
nice
effect
truly
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
great
cure
for
spring
fever
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
would
believe
this
to
have
come
from
belgium
very
nicely
done
an
enjoyable
brew
clipper
citys
heavy
seas
series
has
produced
some
interesting
beers
not
all
of
them
are
spoton
stylewise
but
theyre
all
pretty
tasty
this
one
comes
closer
to
the
real
deal
than
i
expected
and
though
its
not
quite
as
transcendent
as
the
best
authentic
belgians
in
this
category
it
should
most
definitely
be
sought
out
and
savored
this
poured
a
rather
uninteresting
gold
with
a
white
head
that
dropped
to
nothing
fairly
quickly
but
the
smell
is
good
light
and
refreshing
with
sweet
summer
fruits
peaches
and
apricots
maybe
that
make
up
for
the
unexceptional
appearance
the
taste
is
good
its
light
and
fruity
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
looking
forward
to
the
next
sip
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
to
enjoy
after
youve
been
working
outside
but
your
done
for
the
day
and
ready
to
kick
back
which
is
what
i
am
doing
now
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
yet
its
got
enough
backbone
too
the
fruity
spicieness
is
awsome
in
this
beer
very
delicious
would
have
liked
some
laceing
this
one
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
i
expected
much
more
lacing
and
head
when
comparing
to
its
belgian
counterparts
smells
like
hay
spice
and
slight
fruitiness
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
bready
flavor
that
clings
to
the
tongue
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
prickly
co2
hitting
the
tongue
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
i
would
definitely
seek
out
again
pours
a
slightly
hazed
yellowyorange
color
offwhite
head
fades
rather
quickly
spotty
lacing
left
behind
smell
is
belgian
yeast
some
lemon
some
pear
taste
is
tart
citrus
more
juicy
pear
a
light
peppery
taste
tightly
carbonated
dry
nice
tartness
mouthfeel
is
just
slightly
thin
but
it
all
comes
out
to
a
really
refreshing
brew
ill
definitely
be
picking
more
of
this
up
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
nice
perhaps
aided
by
bottle
conditioning
drinkability
is
good
due
to
lightness
this
little
soda
pop
of
a
drink
is
extremely
mild
and
drinkable
pretty
fun
beer
but
its
more
of
a
good
wit
or
doublewit
than
a
saison
red
sky
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
orange
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappears
pretty
quick
but
leaves
lots
of
sticking
and
a
thin
layer
of
foam
the
carbonation
is
very
visible
and
abundant
in
a
corsendonk
tulip
big
fruity
saison
nose
lots
of
apricot
peach
and
melon
notes
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
sweet
malts
much
is
the
same
with
the
way
the
brew
tastes
big
and
fruity
clean
flavor
transitions
and
bright
a
bit
of
spice
begins
and
is
followed
heavy
with
big
apricot
and
apple
fruit
subtle
candy
sweet
malts
lay
underneath
it
all
followed
by
a
tangy
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
as
funky
or
rustic
as
i
prefer
in
a
saison
but
a
damn
good
beer
never
the
less
it
sports
a
medium
body
with
a
slightly
coatingcreamy
mouth
feel
some
stickiness
to
the
lips
good
beer
worth
a
shot
if
spotted
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
low
head
but
good
retention
my
first
of
the
heavy
seas
since
i
live
in
colorado
and
they
arent
sold
here
i
am
getting
a
tartness
in
the
taste
and
a
bit
of
warming
in
the
throat
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
odd
to
me
for
this
style
not
unenjoyable
but
not
my
favorite
version
of
a
saison
not
a
bad
beer
and
this
style
is
so
broad
its
hard
to
pin
down
more
of
a
personal
preference
this
certainly
isnt
the
best
of
the
heavy
seas
offerings
a
very
mediocre
beer
i
like
the
attempt
to
make
a
bigger
abv
saison
but
unfortunately
i
dont
think
its
done
terribly
well
southern
tiers
imperial
cherry
saison
is
a
much
better
example
of
an
amped
up
saison
not
sure
on
saison
style
since
this
is
my
first
one
but
for
sitting
on
my
porch
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
beer
was
certainly
a
winner
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
in
mouthfeel
at
least
it
is
perceived
that
way
carbonation
is
light
as
well
as
the
color
of
the
brew
so
youve
already
got
an
impression
that
this
is
going
to
be
light
on
the
palate
this
perception
makes
it
much
more
so
i
like
to
think
that
it
is
toward
the
lighter
side
however
when
i
just
think
about
how
it
feels
on
the
tongue
it
is
much
heavier
and
fuller
than
any
light
beer
should
be
you
can
just
feel
that
thick
malty
sweetness
pushing
down
on
the
palate
overall
good
feeling
this
is
one
id
not
be
ashamed
to
pick
up
again
however
if
i
really
want
a
saison
ill
be
fetching
fantome
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
after
drinking
fantome
ive
been
spoiled
as
for
the
taste
this
is
a
flawed
belgian
there
is
the
candied
sugars
the
sweet
malts
and
the
spices
in
the
finish
but
the
beer
is
a
touch
watery
and
not
making
enough
of
a
statement
with
what
is
there
in
its
ingredients
worse
there
is
an
unpleasantness
in
the
finish
tasting
a
bit
like
wet
cardboard
there
is
too
much
of
a
throaty
burn
to
this
beer
as
well
which
shouldnt
be
the
case
with
a
7
5
abv
the
beer
is
leaving
me
quite
unfulfilled

carbonation
and

decent

no
sediment

regardless
of
what
the
label
says
very
nice

yeasty
spicy

the
first
taste
provides
a
surprising
smooth
mouthfeel
without
the
expected
bite
from
the
spices
and
carbonation
as
it
goes
down
the
throat
the
spicy
bite
kicks
in
however
the
flavour
is
lacking
something
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
if
i
see
this
in
a
bottle
i
will
pick
it
up
to
try
to
get
a
better
experience
not
half
bad
but
not
groundbreaking
i
love
all
things
belgian
the
complexities
imparted
by
the
yeast
strains
are
always
fantastic
so
i
perhaps
graded
this
one
a
little
tougher
than
i
normally
would
and
my
score
doesnt
really
do
it
justice
comparing
it
to
other
saisons
ive
had
hennepin

it
pales
a
little
but
its
still
a
really
tasty
beer
reduce
the
carbonation
profile
just
a
bit
and
enhance
the
aroma
ever
so
slightly
and
this
beer
would
be
great

desiring

a

but
could
be

d
i
rather
enjoyed
this

its
just
different
enough
that
it
was
nice
to
try
something
off
the
beaten
path
but
by
the
same
token
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
well
done
i
would
suggest
it
to
any
of
my
friends
capable
of
handling
something
other
than
an

and
to
anyone
in

nice

citrus
fruit
and
some
spicy
grassy
hops
on
the

mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
undercarbonated
but
overall
its
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
for
those
summer
days
definately
a
brew
ill
be
picking
up
again
d
ive
been
really
impressed
with
everything
from
the
heavy
seas
line
thus
far
i
advocate
the
imperialization
of
nearly
any
style
and
i
feel
its
the
best
way
for
american
brewers
to
put
their
own
mark
on
foreign
tradition
bigger
and
bolder
without
really
trying
to
copy
i
have
no
problem
finishing
this
beeeatch
and
in
many
ways
it
rivals
the
likes
of
hennepin

i
look
forward
to
this
seasonal
edit
i
forgot
to
mention
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
id
have
never
guessed
that
this
is

body
is
to
big
and
sticky
slick
i
prefer
a
light
fluffy
expansive
mouthfeel
in
a
saison
it
also
loses
carbonation
quickly
still
very
drinkable
and
inexpensive
compared
to
other
saisons
on
a
day
with
105
degree
heat
this
hit
the
spot
as
a
side
note
this
was
my
favorite
beer
at
the
philly
beer
week
real
ale
festival
this
past
march
it
was
quite
refreshing
on
cask
poured
a
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
cream
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
sweet
malt
spice
and
yeast
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
complex
blend
of
spices
and
fruits
wonderful
initial
just
slightly
cloying
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
relatively
light
and
very
crisp
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
americanmade
saisons
ive
had
yet
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
w
a
thin
whitehead
which
never
fully
dissipates
leaving
a
decent
lacing
in
my
snifter
a
steely
bready
malt
smell
w
some
hints
of
fruit
and
alcohol
a
crisp
slightly
tart
flavor
mostly
a
cereal
grain
and
corianderlike
taste
w
some
fruits
and
earthy
hops
underneath
a
semidry
finish
a
med
body
on
this
one
lots
of
co2
could
be
a
tad
drier
lighter
though
a
pretty
good

very
drinkable

a
7

d
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
filling
at

good
kick
good

this
is

that
coalesced
around
the
perimeter
of
the

solid
sheet
of

during

tilt
of
the

scent
of
belgian
yeast
and
spice
as
well
as
candy
sugar
perhaps
some
green
apple
and
pear
taste
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
rather
than
a
saison
somewhat
sweet
with
a
honeylike
character
candy
sugar
is
still
present
but
light
fruit
flavors
are
a
little
less
defined
still
going
with
green
apple
and
pear
mouthfeel
starts
out
as
lightbodied
but
slightly
oily
with
a
little
bit
of
effervescence
across
the
front
to
middle
of
the
tongue
more
sweet
and
spicy
than
pucker
at
the
finish
drinkabiity
is
fair
i
found
the
brew
cloyingly
sweet
at
times
which
would
have
been
a
little
more
tolerable
if
there
was
a
little
more
carbonation
to
balance
this
out

enjoyable

though
it
comes

which
is
odd
for

its
still
nice
though
and
has
a
sharp

on

end
pretty
drinkable
almost
sessionable
despite
the
8
alcohol
purchase
before
sep
08
it
was
drinkable
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
but
it
wasnt
bad
md
crisp
light
not
so
overpowering
like
some
other
saisons
d
very
drinkable
but
quite
strong
be
careful
with
this
one

are
nicely
melded
and
nothing
overwhelms
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
eric
cheers
md
mouthfeel
could
be
improved
its
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
tongue
for
a
saison
i
feel
carbonation
is
too
light
drinkability
is
soso
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
very
good
saison
very
drinkable
good
springsummer
beer
d
well
masked
alcohol
tasty
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
light
enough
on
the
palette
to
have
a
few
i
would
drink
this
again
after
having
one
of
these
i
dont
really
plan
to
have
another
so
the
drinkability
takes
a
hit
d
8
is
very
well
hidden
theres
a
little
alcohol
zing
hidden
behind
the
spice
hops
and
potent
yeast
but
its
easily
missed
drinks
easy
and
is
great
on
a
very
warm
day
like
today
it
was
drinkable
because
there
wasnt
much
flavor
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
alcohol
content
this
would
be
a
great
beach
beer
bottled
beer
best
purchased
by
aug
08
on
the
label
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
this
beer
was
a
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
teeny
head
it
had
a
candy
aroma
and
smelled
a
little
yeasty
pretty
muted
aroma
the
taste
was
mostly
sweet
couldnt
really
tell
much
else
thin
mouthfeel
not
much
of
a
saison
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
as
strong
as
ommegangs
hennepin
or
others
of
the
style
still
a
worthy
brew
red
sky
at
night
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
the
aroma
has
some
phenolic
character
some
chalky
dry
yeast
and
light
sweet
malt
the
sweet
pilsner
malt
hits
first
in
the
flavor
followed
by
the
estery
yeast
profile
there
is
a
slightly
peppery
spicy
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
man
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
its
crisp
and
smooth
and
remarkably
easy
drinking
for
its
strength
once
again
im
impressed
with
clipper
city
id
like
to
see
their
regular
offerings
around
here
the
funny
thing
about
this
beer
and
the
barbar
beer
is
that
barbar
is
called
the
rest
of
the
warrior
this
is
just
another
american
knock
off
version
of
my
favorite
style
of
beer
the
barnyardiness
seems
to
be
contrived
no
true
earthiness
or
horse
shit
smells
that
a
real
saison
has
too
much
cloviness
very

this
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
saison
and
quite
drinkable
d
good
if
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
get
to
you
than
you
could
drink
this
indefinitely
well
ignoring
the
strength
the
flavor
is
nice
yet
another
pleasant
clipper
city
brew
a
very
pale
medium
gold
with
almost
no
head
and
slowly
percolating
carbonation
looks
like
a
lot
of
beers
but
a
single
sniff
tells
otherwise
the
aroma
is
strong
earthy
and
sweet
with
a
slight
banana
note
tastes
like
a
sweet
slightly
thick
tripel
with
a
bit
more
funk
and
body
very
little
bitterness
just
plenty
of
odd
phenolic
notes
in
the
taste
and
the
smell
interesting
beer
but
a
little
much
to
spend
more
than
2
or
3
bottles
with
solid
saison
definitely
not
an
extremeoutlandishoverthetop
example
of

but
just
a
simple

flavors
are
pleasantly
balanced
between
the
sweet
malts
and
a
quiet
presence
of
pepper
cloves

i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
even
a
good
session
beeer
in
the
summer
this
might
be
a

for
someone
who
wants
to
get

not

this
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
and
textures
but
they
are
very
soft
i
was
surprised
that
the
abv
is

it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
when
chilled
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
more
of
a

corn
taste
started
coming
out
poured
a
thick
foamy
pale

and
after
a
good
many

the

mellow
yeasty
belgian
character
gives

to

and
a
dash
of
zesty
lemon
for
an
8
beer
it
comes
off
as
light
and
refreshing
body
and
taste
make
me
think
there
is
a
good
portion
of
wheat
a
solid
saison
especially
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
specialize
in
belgian
ales
cloudy
yellow
with
a
large
foamy
head
and
plenty
of
active
carbonation
smell
is
sweet
alcohol
but
nothing
in
the
barnyard
vein
there
are
some
hints
that
this
is
a
belgian
style
in
the
notes
over
the
alcohol
taste
has
the
dryness
of
a
decent
saison
but
it
is
overshadowed
by
the
distinct
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
the
body
of
the
brew
is
a
bit
shallow
with
the
finish
being
dominated
by
the
alcohol
burn
drinkability
suffers
because
of
this
this
very
very
drinkable
im
looking
forward
to
getting
some
more
next
summer
sucks
that
i
had
to
find
a
lonely
single
this
late
in
the
season
very
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
mediumsized
head
that
is
very
pretty
laces
well
aroma
is
very
appetizing
and
very
belgian
with
big
bubble
gum
and
spicy
pepper
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
could
swear
this
was
one
of
the
classic
strong
belgian
dark
ales
peppery
and
a
bit
hot
going
down
this
one
is
exciting
and
still
very
drinkable
i
taste
white
grapes
alcohol
and
a
backbone
of
spicy
hops
to
keep
the
grainy
malt
at
bay
feel
is
fine
though
not
quite
as
dry
and
spritzy
as
i
expected
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
although
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
as
the
hotness
would
most
likely
bring
on
a
headache
an
effervesent
pale
golden
beer
has
a
big
foamy
bright
white
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lace
there
is
a
light
fruity
aroma
with
hints
of
peaches
and
apples
the
flavor
starts
with
a
light
candy
sweetness
that
gives
way
quickly
to
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
this
beer
leaves
one
feeling
unfullfilled
unlike
typical
offerings
of
the
style
this
one
came
in
a
six
pack
of
12
oz
bottles
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
ton
of
streamers
and
a
large
egg
shell
head
made
this
look
the
part
of
a
classic
saison
the
aroma
was
more
hoppy
than
anticipated
with
a
spicy
citric
smell
more
typical
of
an
ipa
than
a
belgian
style
there
was
also
a
background
of
perfumey
alcoholic
earthy
smells
the
taste
was
light
spicy
and
citric
and
dry
but
not
quite
as
dry
as
other
saisons
very
delicious
and
quenching
and
a
good
approachable
take
on
the
style
overall
first
saison
ale
and
im
liking
it
this
one
in
particular
seems
to
be
a
little
unbalanced
but
overall
it
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
seems
like
it
might
go
well
with
some
spicey
food
side
note
on
the
label
it
sucks
and
would
make
you
not
want
to
drink
this
beer
at
all
make
you
think
its
some
kind
of
lager
or
pale
ale
do
not
be
fooled
here
soak
the
bottle
and
pour
it
out

drinkability
a
little
more

than
i
expected
a
nice

and
certainly
an
upgrade
over
most

beer
this
is
really
a
great
offering
and
falls
just

of
being
excellent
i
am
glad
on
this
one
that
did
buy
the
six
pack
into
an
oversize

grainy

some

along
with

and
very
dry
alchohol

more
than
needed
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
nothing
exceptional
i
wondered
why
they
called
it
red
sky
at
night
when
they
poured
it
for
me
it
started
off
all
head
then
as
i
let
it
sit
there
the
head
became
this
cloud
and
the
beer
which
has
a
red
tint
to
it
actually
looked
like
it
was
falling
from
the
sky
it
was
amazing
the
beer
itself
was
good
had
a
sweet

minty
taste

end
very
refreshing

no

not
really
expected
in
the

taste
is
yeasty
certainly
a
summer
beer
good
for
the
style
not
great
i
think
i
would
rather
just
have
a
wheat
beer
it
cant
seem
to
decide
what
it
is
somewhat
too
bubbly
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
would
have
more
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
not
a
bad

its

thats
the

about

to

that
its

seemingly
not

no
expectations
but
with
the
abv
what
it
is
it
doesnt
deliver
enough
in
return
to
justify
drinking
more
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
saison
as
it
were
a
very
flavorful
saison
light
and
drinkable
for
an
8
abv
version
of
the
style
one
of
my
first
clipper
city
encounters
and
im
very
pleased
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
tall
stark
white
head
the
aroma
has
some
spice
to
it
as
well
as
kind
of
a
weiss
bier
clove
and
banana
thing
going
on
taste
is
interesting
sweet
yet
tart
fruity
and
spicy
with
a
definate
yeasty
undercurrent
refreshing
to
drink
pretty
complex
but
the
flavours
dont
seem
to
meld
fluidly
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
pleasant
carbonation
that
keeps
the
palate
clean
and
refreshed
drinkability
well
i
would
buy
this
again
to
have
at
home
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
a
session
beer
oout
of
this
a
oragnish
gold
body
with
a
white
head
that
disapates
quickly
the
nose
holds
a
pleasent
hoppiness
with
some
sweet
malty
notes
containing
a
citrus
underbelly
the
taste
is
of
gold
grain
and
peppery
citrus
with
muted
noble
hops
it
has
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
that
is
bready
but
not
funky
and
with
a
spicy
twang
that
makes
this
a
good
sipper
and
enjoyable
the
8
is
well
hidden
making
this
dangerously
drinkable
if
a
little
thin
in
the
yeasty
feel
always
my
favorite
in
the
heavy
seas
lineup
this
years
red
sky
is
a
bit
more
balanced
and
less
sweet
which
is
a
good
thing
but
it
still
retains
the
berrylike
and
citrusy
fruitiness
that
makes
it
so
exciting
and
enjoyable
its
hazy
golden
body
has
an
orange
cast
beneath
its
quicktofade
head
of
bright
white
and
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
steadily
rising
towards
the
surface
the
nose
is
vibrant
with
fruity
yeastiness
and
a
sweetish
maltiness
its
crisp
and
then
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
gently
effervescent
carbonation
some
touches
of
orange
and
lemon
appear
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
berrylike
juiciness
its
sweetly
malty
without
being
overlydone
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
sneaks
in
from
somewhere
and
helps
to
balance
it
hints
of
hop
flavor
also
appear
and
its
nicely
balanced
with
a
restrained
bitterness
that
lets
the
malt
and
yeast
shine
while
still
finishing
with
a
bit
of
chalky
dryness
i
absolutely
loved
the
previous
heavily
dextrinous
version
but
this
is
far
more
drinkable
kudos
since
this
is
my
first
saison
im
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
more
as
it
seems
there
are
many
out
there
which
are
worthy
im
really
starting
to
love
belgian
beers
and
the
breweries
attempts
in
the
us
at
many
of
the
great
styles
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
and
check
out
the
artwork
as
thats
what
led
me
to
it
and
i
know
clipper
city
has
a
few
more
great
heavy
seas
labels
because
there
are
a
few
more
styles
than
just
this
dn
very
good
saison
goes
down
fairly
easily
and
the
alcohol
gives
a
nice
warm
feeling
good
one
to
try
thanks
to
the
blitheringidiot
for
gifting
me
this
in
a
sixer
of
the
clippers
cloudy
bright
golden
orange
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
fruity
spicy
aromas
tropical
fruit
orange
and
lemon
flavors
a
bit
of
a
sourness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
alcohol
very
well
hidden
drinkability
is
good
well
crafted
beer
not
sure
about
the
saison
designation
though
solid
tasting
beer
that
got
better
with
a
little
warming
drinkablity
is
very
good
a
very
nice
offerring
from
clipper
city
i
just
wish
i
had
another
i
love
what
clipper
city
has
done
with
their
heavy
seas
line
namely
jack
up
the
flavor
and
the
abv
so
that
lovers
of
big
beer
feel
right
at
home
glancing
back
to
the
first
paragraph
it
looks
like
delighted
wins
the
day
a
hearty
aye
matey
and
a
big
thank
you
to
lackenhauser
for
the
bottle
pours
into
my
belgian
style
glass
with
a
clear
gold
color
and
sufficient
white
head
smell
is
between
a
wit
and
a
hefe
with
a
little
banana
and
spice
and
sulfur
taste
is
pineapples
ginger
and
bananas
with
a
dry
alcohol
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
with
zesty
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
nice
and
seems
addictive
with
its
flavor
drinkability
and
warming
alcohol
sensation
its
distinctive
and
definately
worth
a
try
this
poured
out
a
clear
bubbly
golden
yellow
with
a
very
small
white
bubbly
head
that
that
left
little
lacing
scents
of
spice
mainly
coriander
that
i
could
pick
out
and
a
slight
malty
sweetness
rose
from
the
glass
there
were
also
notes
of
doughy
yeast
kind
but
overall
a
mild
aroma
the
flavor
was
better
with
a
sweet
spicy
taste
coming
up
front
along
with
slight
fruit
notes
such
as
apple
the
after
taste
was
a
spicy
bitter
one
with
a
touch
of
lime
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
with
a
good
carbonated
feel
to
it
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
not
as
good
as
their
double
pilsner
but
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
as
far
as
saisons
go
ive
definitely
had
better
as
for
locals
i
stand
by
the
saison
at
wharf
rat
i
do
enjoy
this
however
it
is
a
nice
fruityspicy
blend
with
a
nice
lacing
of
vanilla
that
i
detected
in
the
nose
it
is
a
nice
creamy
beer
that
would
definitely
be
worth
having
a
few
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
1
of
white
head
over
the
honeyhued
brew
dense
head
shows
good
staying
power
with
nice
lacing
of
foamy
bits
aroma
is
a
bit
spicy
in
that
belgianish
with
an
undercurrent
of
alcohol
mixed
in
taste
is
initially
grainy
like
a
wheat
malt
effect
and
then
seems
to
just
spread
out
in
the
mouth
with
the
light
alcohol
notes
touching
all
the
bases
so
to
speak
i
find
the
saisons
as
a
whole
hard
to
describe
tastewise
so
bear
with
me
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
are
both
good
an
enjoyable
brew
pours
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
carbonation
is
low
though
entirely
adequate
and
the
beer
is
a
deep
clear
gold
color
this
beer
has
a
nice
funky
yeast
driven
nose
that
has
spicy
notes
of
orange
coriander
and
musty
cellars
it
is
lightly
sweet
and
quite
fruity
with
notes
of
tropical
fruit
there
is
a
spicy
sharpness
here
as
well
which
helps
to
balance
the
other
notes
i
get
notes
of
ginger
lemon
and
a
slight
astringency
when
the
yeast
is
added
to
the
beer
i
get
a
slight
nuttiness
that
develops
this
is
a
nice
mix
of
competing
flavors
this
poured
a
clear
orangey
gold
color
full
of
carbonation
but
no
discernable
head
the
aroma
is
interesting
with
sweet
and
sticky
candy
malt
with
a
hint
of
metallic
notes
the
taste
is
light
tangy
and
highly
flavorful
im
getting
orange
liqueur
syrup
fruity
rock
candy
and
a
touch
of
bitter
grapefruit
the
finish
leaves
a
bittersweet
tang
in
the
throat
overall
this
is
very
nice
and
enjoyable
beer
a
good
one
to
enjoy
in
warm
weather

pours
a
pale
orangey
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
it
leaves
no
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
hoegaarden
of
bananas
and
medicine
the
taste
is
medicinal
and
very
strange
the
first
hit
on
the
tongue
is
bland
and
uneventful
but
when
the
aftertaste
hits
whew
harsh
aftertaste
reminding
me
again
of
the
belgian
white
wheat
the
bottom
of
the
glass
is
hard
to
finish
never
again
on
this
one
beer
is
good
happy
mixed
style
beering
a
deep
golden
colour
with
nice
clarity
and
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
show
the
aroma
is
a
bit
simple
and
onesided
for
a
saisonstyle
ale
i
smell
oranges
coriander
other
citric
fruits
spicy
yeast
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
good
but
very
witlike
and
one
sided
again
the
taste
is
wheaty
spicy
citruslike
and
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
gets
the
job
done
and
the
drinkability
is
just
fine
this
is
another
good
beer
but
this
is
not
a
trus
saison
in
my
book
this
is
more
like
a

saision
cross
drinkability
ridiculously
so
a
couple
of
bad
bottles
it
was
pretty
dead
in

and
the
finish
was
long
in
the
wrong
way
nice
golden

slight

that
lingers
a

with
a

then
it
sneaking
up

you
not

sure
how
it

to
a

are

with

i
can
immediately
recognize
that
jolly
pumpkin

aroma

flavor
which
is
very
pleasant
i
can
detect
hay
citrus
and
light
oak
notes
in
the

flavors
are
able
to
pop
thanks
to
the
spritzy
carbonation
lemon
and
light
citrus
play
well
with
the
bright
funk
notes
which
are
subtle
the
tartness
and
the
tannins
from
the
oak
coat
your
mouth
in
a
wonderful
way
and
the
dryness
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
this
is
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
beer
pours
a
very

very
good
beer
my
first
try
with
jolly
pumpkin
will
definitely
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
o
a
very
underrated
beer
the
funk
character
reminded
me
so
much
of
cantillon
but
the
tartness
was
lower
being
a
farmhouse
style
i
didnt
expect
that
but
a
welcomed
surprise
good
to
the
taste
with
yeast
and
malts
and
funk
and
some
light

overall
this
one
took
me
by

really
a

absolutely

picked
up
a
bottle
this
weekend
dated
november
2013
its
been
a
couple
of
years
since
ive
had
any
jolly
pumpkin
beers
and
now
i
regret
not
buying
them
more
often
bam
biere
is
a
simple
yet
tasty
farmhouse
ale
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
relatively
light
package
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
color
and
quickly
amasses
quite
a
large
and
fluffy
bright
white
head
aroma
fills
your
nose
with
lots
of
yeasty
funk
and
earthiness
right
off
the
bat
a
bit
fruity
and
just
a
touch
of
bready
malt
in
there
as
well
first
sip
tells
you
all
you
need
to
know
about
this
farmhouse
ale
its
the
real
deal
tart
and
funk
with
a
nice
dose
of
juicy
fruits
and
an
ever
so
light
touch
of
herbal
hops
this
beer
like
many
a
good
saison
really
goes
to
show
how
much
flavor
can
be
packed
into
such
a
low
abv
beer
overall
this
was
a
tasty
lighter
style
beer
beautiful
to
look
at
but
the
bandaid
and
funk
flavors
just
didnt
combine
well
for
this
particular
beer
very
easy
to
drink
the
bomber
but
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
anytime
soon
i
know
bottle
conditioning
is
a
thing
but
sometimes
it
just
goes
too
far
im
a
reasonably
patient
man
but
this
sort
of
shit
just
doesnt
pass
the
smell
test
well
it
does
actually
as
thats
all
i
can
do
with
this
beer
for
a
long
while
once
ive
poured
it
pretty
yes
pretty
wanky
even
more
so
while
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
the
flavour
or
overall
bearing
of
this
offering
shitty
presentation
just
has
that
cranky
negative
effect
on
me
o
its
a
great
beer
and
everything
works
really
well
together
jolly
pumpkin
consistently
produces
beers
with

them

dont

to

that
this
the

of

is
phenomenal
for
a
beer
of

i

the

another

for

neither
was

but
the

the
sour
a
good
overall
tartness
though
somewhat
thin
nonspicy
food
its
easy
to
see
why
the
saison
style
is
a
farmhouse
ale
in
that
i
can
see
just
about
any
simple
provincial
fare
going
very
well
with
this
a

wow
i
had
no
idea
this
was
coming
to
colorado
was
very
excited
to
see
it
in
liquor
maxs
newsletter
definitely
a
great
saison
this
beer
is
a
hazy
yellow
with
probably
the
hugest
head
ive
ever
seen
pure
white
but
it
suits
the
refreshing
quality
of
this
beer
perfectly
as
i
said
most
of
jps
beers
are
not
on
my
buy
again
list
but
this
is
a
smooth
summer
style
beer
that
i
could
see
having
again
d
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
with
a
nice
sourness
to
it
first
jolly
pumpkin
brew
and
i
will
try
some
of
their
others
a
very
crisp
beverage
very
refreshing
and
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
that
is
dry
enough
to
want
another
but
not
enough
to
tire
the
palate
very
well

a
good

helped
this

hold
for
what
seemed
like
an

aroma
is
floral

spicy
and
a
bit
funky
a
few
citrus
notes
in
the
background
near
the

the
aroma
seemed
to
become
perfumey
soft
carbonation
gives
this
a
great
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
a
bit
of
tartness
followed
by
some
earthy

and
lingering

zest
great
patches
of

are
left
clinging
to
the

i
drink
this
brew
lingering
earthy
and
grassy
bitterness
there
is
a
bit
of
funky
flavor
that
hits
as
you
raise
the
glass
to
your
lips
seemed
just
a
bit
harsh
for
me
which
hurts
the
drinkability
somewhat
overall
pretty
good
d
not
as
drinkable
as
i
thought
it
would
be
for
a

i
am
also
glad
this
wasnt
in
the
typical
750ml
jolly
pumpkin
bottle
12oz
was
just
right
this
is
the
3rd
jolly
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
and
the
first
one
that
we
cant
actually
get
in
south
bend
pours
orange
and
mostly
clear
with
one
of
those
great
white
creamy
puffball
heads
that
good
saisons
get
sour
tangy
odor
some
light
spiciness
fruity
tangy
taste
some
fresh
grassy
hop
flavor
that
sets
it
apart
from
some
other
saisons
quite
flavorful
and
intresting
also
very
easy
to
drink
a
refreshing
yet
different
example
of
the
style
i
like
the
bottle
on
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
fruity
perfumy
hops
almost
like
rose
hips
yeast
aroma
comes
through
taste
is
hops
bright
fruits
with
slight
alcohol
and
grain
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
super
foamy
and
sharp
pretty
interesting
drinkability
is
good
light
and
zesty
and
sessionable
too
no
end
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
a
great
summer
refresher
i
will
enjoy
this
beer
again
soon
a
lightcrisp
pleasing
mouthfeelvery
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
also
recommended
tasting
here
thanks
to
the
wvbeergeek
for
bringing
this
beer
down
overall
i
enjoy
jps
experimentation
and
this
does
well
for
their
portfolio
of
brews
extremely
high
drinkability
with
a
unique
did
i
stress
that
enough
take
on
a
saison
definately
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
but
beware
of
the
tart
sour
finish
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
felt
really
light
and
airy
going
down
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
oil
on
the
tongue
i
could
see
myself
really
getting
the
hang
of
this
in
the
warmer
weather
the
most
drinkable
funky
brew
ive
ever
had
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
with
large
champagne
like
bubbles
the
smell
is
citrus
with
sour
notes
with
some
spice
and
yeast
characters
as
well
the
taste
is
citrus
up
front
with
the
yeastdoughy
flavor
followed
but
a
not
overwhelming
but
very
noticable
sour
that
lingers
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
light
with
carbonation
that
adds
texture
to
the
beer
this
one
is
not
the
easiest
drinking
beer
especially
for
those
not
familiar
with
the
style
this
is
different
and
worth
checking
out
enjoy
light
orange
pour
with
big
saison
head
but
low
residual
carbonation
less
spicy
flavors
than
the
other
commercial
standards
but
a
nice
low
final
gravity
keeps
the
taste
light
and
the
taste
buds
awake
and
looking
for
more
flavor
tart
and
lemony
with
some
nice
yeastybready
notes
last
swigs
d
a
fine
brew
would
go
well
in
place
of
wine
of
campange
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
would
go
easy
with
many
different
food
combonations
drinkability
is
good
since
i
had
3
in
a
row
slainte
d
a
lot
going
on
but
spiciness
and
dry
finish
dance
well
together
this
beer
is
sold
by
the
sixer
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
a
night
but
could
see
having
it
on
hand
as
an
occasional
reward
its
more
tart
then
other
saisons
and
lacks
the
body
that
others
do
but
its
alright
enjoyed
multiple
pints
of
this
nice
saison
on
tap
at
3
different
spots
in
the
ann
arbor

area

weekend

seeking
out
and
enjoying
poured
out
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
was
strong
with
yeast
notes
some
delicate
fruit
and
caramel
the
taste
was
fairly
simple
yeast
mostly
tiny
bit
of
malt
not
much
to
say
here
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
too
much
goes
down
easy
but
a
poor
finishing
flavor
one
of
the
beauties
of
this
beer
is
that
to
me
it
could
be
nothing
but
beer
some
beers
seem
candyish
or
chocolaty
or
very
fruity
or
just
hops
this
has
everything
present
but
in
the
end
the
flavor
is
not
very
much
like
anything
that
i
have
ever
tasted
besides
well
beer
a
good
one
that
has
that
special
magic
like
jolly
pumpkins
calabaza
blanca
theyve
got
the
framework
for
a
great
beer
here
but
the
recipe
particularly
the
balance
of
flavors
needs
some
fine
tuning
id
like
to
see
this
beer
in
a
few
years
as
im
hopeful
that
captain
ron
and
company
will
be
able
to
broaden
the
flavors
in
this
brew
until
then
ill
keep
drinking
la
luciernaga
listed
on
this
website
as
a
belgian
pale
ale
however
it
is
clearly
a
saison
and
a
better
one
than
bam
biere
overall
ok
but
too
tart
very
drinkable
just
not
to
my
taste
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
with
a
nice

feel

and
goes
down
very
easily
what
an
interesting
little
session
saison
these
dexterians
have
whipped
up
ill
be
ordering
another
soon
the
drinkability
is
good
the
lightness
makes
this
beer
an
easy
drink
and
the
flavours
are
mild
enough
to
avoid
becoming
overbearing
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
in
true
farmhouse
ale
tradition
i
would
say
this
is
most
likely
a
very
proper
rendition
of
the
style
another
solid
product
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
a
saison
that
looks
and
smells
wonderful
but
attacks
the
palate
and
tastebuds
too
aggressively
to
achieve
a
perfect
balance
bam
biere
is
an
excellent
jp
offering
and
is
second
only
to
the
outstanding
oro
de
calabaza
in
my
opinion
this
bottle
disappeared
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
and
i
find
myself
wanting
more
i
love
the
idea
of
a
sessionable
saison
that
comes
in
12
ounce
bottles
i
wish
more
american
craft
breweries
would
follow
jolly
pumpkins
example
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
probably
the
best
saison
ive
had
ive
been
a
big
kick
of
sour
beers
lately
so
really
no
surprise
i
was
pleased
with
this
offering
heres
to
trying
many
more
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin

beer
a
would
definitely
buydrink
again
goes
down
very
easily
a
semirare
feat
a
belgian
style
ale
from
a
nonbelgian
brewery
that
not
only
tastes
good
but
actually
tastes
like
the
style
its
supposed
to
be
my
third
saison
this
blows
away
the
one
saison
dupont
i
had
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
biere
de
miel
also
from
dupont
im
thinking
straight
saisons
might
just
not
be
my
style
pours
out
to
a
brownishgold
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
yeast
and
light
plum
the
taste
is
lighter
than
i
expected
with
a
light
fruity
tartness
to
it
not
complex
but
then
it
shouldnt
be
as
the
style
is
quite
simple
being
as
its
a
farmhouse
ale
refreshing
the
beer
exploded
from
the
bottle
into
my
glass
with
a
head
that
could
not
be
contained
beautiful
bountifel
lacing
smell
is
banana
like
fruity
yeasty
taste
follows
through
with
more
fruit
and
banana
and
a
strong
pepper
taste
at
the
finish
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
and
pleasant
to
drink
extremely
refreshing
pours
yielding
a
massive
foam
head
which
nearly
escapes
the
glass
rim
it
settles
very
slowly
leaving
some
nice
lace
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
deep
gold
with
nice
clarity
a
fairly
potent
aroma
of
lemon
spice
dominates
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
floral
hoppiness
also
the
taste
carries
more
of
the
spiced
lemon
zest
which
is
mildy
tart
the
flavor
doesnt
open
up
to
much
complexity
however
but
does
turn
to
a
earthy
dirtlike
finish
very
dry
low
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
yet
fluffy
with
a
good
mouthful
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
it
is
perhaps
a
good
session
beer
considering
its
low
abv
but
not
overly
unique
for
sasion
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
aroma
a
nice
blend
sweet
spices
with
some
lightly
sour
citrus
fruit
a
small
amount
of
hops
pops
out
and
a
nice
hit
of
yeast
and
pepper
flavor
the
sourness
comes
out
first
followed
by
citrus
and
the
pepper
lemon
after
working
around
the
house
all
day
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
wind
down
with
m
mouthful
is
light
and
bubbly
leaves
mouth
with
earthy
spicy
after
taste
goes
down
smooth
this
arrived
with
a
thick
white
head
above
a
very
cloudy
mediumamber
colored
beer
the
nose
was
really
funky
obviously
yeastdriven
with
a
sour
quality
to
it
like
overripe
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
and
the
taste
had
a
vinous
quality
like
a
dry
white
wine
the
finish
was
likewise
dry
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
that
yeasty
funk
i
have
to
admit
this
was
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
on
draft
not
cask
and
i
was
disappointed
i
got
johns
grocery
in
iowa
city
to
sell
me
a
single
bottle
out
of
a
sixpack
just
so
that
i
could
rereview
it
that
review
has
already
been
posted
so
it
might
be
interesting
to
compare
my
two
reviews
one
beer
does
not
change
my
stance
though
jolly
pumpkin
is
da
bomb
yo
overall
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
but
its
not
terrible
the
carbonation
is
a
little
extreme
and
the
flavor
is
kinda
dull
im
reviewing
this
directly
from
the
fridge
so
im
hoping
once
it
warms
up
a
bit
it
will
bring
out
some
more
flavor
definitely
will
drink
more
of
these
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
the
abv
wont
knock
you
out
mouthfeel
is
md
but
dextrinous
carbonation
is
strong
despite
my
releasing
a
large
amount
during
the
pours
minimal
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
and
decent
yeasting
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
summer
quencher
and
imo
a
relatively
simple
saison
one
that
was
a
great
opportunity
for
me
to
explore
into
relatively
unfamiliar
territory
this
is
a
dead
on
saison
drinkability
notes

slightly
tart
and
all
this
flavor
at
under
5
abv
now
that
is
a
hot
summer
day
quencher
with
some
character
not
sure
if
there
is
brett
in
this
one
if
there
is
i
imagine
that
it
is
to
blame
for
my
overcarbonation
hopefully
its
finished
eating
overall
impression
being
in
dexter
michigan
i
never
thought
i
would
try
jolly
pumpkins
artisan
ales
well
thy
bottle
condition
great
beer
this
beer
is
cleanly
fermented
and
has
such
a
wonderful
farmhouse
or
barnyard
flavors
if
you
can
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
do
it
great
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
on
the
deck
bbqing
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
and
not
get
sick
of
them
i
would
imagine
this
is
how
old
school
saisons
taste
drinkable
and
enjoyable
with
an
edge
try
it
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
answer
to
a
july
heatwave
overall
a
very
interesting
saison
aroma
is
incredible
i
think
the
taste
i
do
not
think
compares
to
the
aroma
but
i
think
this
will
be
a
great
beer
if
it
had
just
a
little
more
alcohol
to
fill
the
mouthfeel
up
however
i
cant
knock
that
too
much
cuz
i
think
that
is
a
personel

funky

spicy

herbal

aroma
mixed
with

funky
yeast
mix
definitely
an
acidic
character

great
smelling
overall
flavor
is
grassy
and
spicy
upfront
with
funk
ridden
citrus
combo
going
on
as
well
one
of
the
better
more
creative
american
saisons
ive
come
across
what
has
gotten
into
this
folks
up
in
dexter

wow
this
is
the
bam
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
by
no
means
thin
healthy
carbonation
carries
the
flavors
very
nicely
almost
spritzy
in
a
sense
spice
mixture
coats
the
palate
and
sticks
around
drinkability
a
very
quaffable
challenging
version
of
this
style
great
for
the
warmer
months
not
to
be
turned
down
especially
on
draft
good
stuff
sampled
on
the
4th
of
july
with
my
cousin
and
brother
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
an
thick
active
carbonated
body
and
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
and
left
some
good
lacing
the
nose
of
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
mix
of
brett
and
earthy
tones
and
some
spice
and
malt
that
made
my
taste
buds
quickly
jump
in
for
their
share
of
the
beer
the
taste
was
very
strong
as
well
with
a
nice
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
but
balanced
out
well
with
the
sweet
maltiness
and
earthniess
running
around
in
there
the
body
is
light
but
complex
and
makes
for
a
very
good
summer
brew
the
beer
empties
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
bits
of
suspended
matter
the
head
modest
in
size
semicreamy
in
texture
the
color
a
splendiferous
white
and
the
residual
lace
a
velum
like
sheet
to
obfuscate
the
glass
nose
has
a
sprightly
citrus
like
tone
hints
of
hops
and
a
nice
malt
sweetness
at
the
back
start
is
tartly
sweet
grain
presence
delectable
and
the
top
moderate
in
feel
finish
is
prickly
in
its
acidity
the
hops
delightful
a
nice
semisweet
dry
aftertaste
ends
this
most
excellent
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
thebeercellar2
poured
a
slightly
hazy
blonde
color
ale
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
with
great
retention
very
interesting
aroma
consisting
of
brett
with
some
sweet
malt
some
funk
and
some
wheat
and
spices
taste
as
some
sourness
and
funkyness
which
is
well
balance
with
some
sweet
malt
some
light
spices
and
some
oak
characteristic
very
well
done
and
very
interesting
from
this
brewery
which
just
seem
to
continually
amaze
me
to
be
enjoyed
without
any
sign
of
moderation
touching
story
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
to
boot
cant
recommend
this
beer
enough
listen
i
dont
believe
in
this
mouthfeel
mishmash
in
fact
my
mouth
feels
a
bit
filthy
saying
it
but
my
tongue
feels
that
this
is
a
member
of
the
fruit
family
namely
the
glockenspiel
fruit
playing
jesus
music
it
pings
in
there
and
bounces
from
tooth
to
tooth
boong
baaang
bong
bong
and
my
belly
says
it
is
truly
the
spice
lords
stamping
their
gummy
little
feet
into
the
loam
and
making
footprints
and
theres
a
tractor
behind
a
barn
carrying
apples
to
a
spicebarrel
and
dropping
them
in
and
all
the
monkeys
are
loose
and
throwing
gobs
of
the
pulp
at
the
back
of
your
throat
and
your
uvula
is
saying
aaahhh
carbonation
is
very
high
with
a
light
body
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
low
in
abv
and
super
easy
to
drink
cheers
this
takes
belgian
style
carbonation
to
another
plane
of
existence
very
carbonated
a
bit
too
much
otherwise
awesome
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
believe
it
rivals
many
belgian
saison
offerings
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
minimal
head
lots
of
bubbles
dancing
around
in
the
glass
it
has
an
interesting
aroma
of
apple
citrus
and
a
good
heaping
of
yeast
the
taste
was
nice
lemon
and
apple
a
nice
floral
touch
with
the
openfermentation
tartness
and
overall
very
refreshing
for
a
warm
summer
day
overall
its
quite
impressive
the
initial
broadness
of
the
yeast
softens
as
it
warms
to
reveal
its
full
range
and
the
combination
of
muddy
brett
and
floral
hops
is
engaging
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
mainstream
or
entrylevel
beer
connoseur
but
rather
a
teasing
delicacy
for
those
familiar
with
the
complex
beers
of
belgium
and
southern
france
nope
didnt
like
this
much
at
all
either
for
style
or
overall
seems
like
a
lot
of
other
peoples
comments
mirror
mine
yet
they
rate
it
higher
guess
its
just
a
matter
of
taste
i
like
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
but
theyre
always
on
the
brink
of
over
attenuation
and
this
one
kinda
falls
off
in
that
regard
its
easy
to
drink
but
overall
its
kinda
weak
poured
cloudy
pale
peach
with
mammoth
soapy
white
head
the
beer
exploded
on
the
initial
pour
so
i
only
got
about
23
into
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
appropriately
sour
fruitiness
lemons
and
spices
cloves
pepper
dry
and
rather
hopped
and
yeasty
flavors
up
front
middle
is
full
of
earthy
yeast
lemons
tangerines
and
pepper
tastes
s
bit
restrained
compared
to
the
aroma

words

seems
a

it

highly

you

in

it
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
a
must
have
but
the
bitterness
is
too
much
for
its
own
good
and
some
sugars
would
really
bring
out
a
tremendous
amount
of
character

o

its

theres

one
ive

had
from

not
by

its

good
for

its
definitely
worth
a
try
although
im
not

if
i
would
buy
it
in
a
store
overall

i
personally
prefer
more
funk
and
tangyness
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
they
were
going
for

a

probably
my
favorite
bam
i
let
the
beer
warm
back
up
to
about
60
f
and
this
beer
really
started
to
shine
but
it
reminded
a
more
of
an
unblended
lambic
then
a
saison
the
yeast
came
through
as
the
dark
wheat
malt
tasted
like
it
was
melding
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
many
of
the
characteristics
of
the
saison
that
i
expected
were
muted
at
best
but
i
did
appreciate
the
flavor
that
was
there
it
was
just
something
different
than
i
expected
oa
good
dark

saisons
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this

an

of

with
a
dark
twist
just
wish
the
taste
was
more
pronounced
to
faintwatery
for
a
higher
rating
but
a
highly
drinkable
beer
none

this
could
be

batch

i
emailed
jp
to
find
out
the
bottling
date
with
a
very
quick
response
of
october
or
november
of
2008
5
years
in
the
bottle
this
was
fantastic
all
flavors
really
shine
through
with
a
nice
surprise
of
dried
fruit
added
super
lactic
and
funky
but
just
extremely
well
balanced
well
worth
holding
on
to
this
brew
for
a
while
overall
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
this
beer
is
interesting
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
other
releases
its
a
easy
drinker
and
teeters
on
going
sour
but
just
not
quit
there
it
is
balanced
not
a
bad
lightly
funky
farmhouse
ale
not
my
absolute
favorite
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
its
another
stand
up
beer
from
them
would
i
drink
another
one
i
wouldnt
mind
another
one
o
a
nice
crisp
farmhouse
ale
that
takes
a
few
steps
outside
the
normal
boundaries
of
this
category
i
wish
the
funk
in
the
aroma
came
through
more
with
the
tartness
in
the
flavor
and
would
probably
make
this
a
regular
if
it
was
so
as
is
i
will
probably
seek
out
funkier
andor
sourer
farmhouses
d
and
o
its
a
very
interesting
beer
it
separates
itself
from
the
bam
biere
by
the
rich
malty
body
its
a
really
nice
beer
dominated
by
the
jp
yeast
strain
its
a
solid
brew
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
from
the
sweet
and
sour
sides
making
the
funk
stand
out
a
little
more
than
it
needs
to
not
a
bad
beer
but
this
likely
wont
be
a
revisit
for
me
mainly
because
jp
makes
so
many
other
delicious
beers
batch
1089
bottled
07
mar
2012
appearance
is
similar
to
a
bock
beer
in
my
opinion
a
translucent
auburn
hue
the
aroma
was
interesting
reminding
me
of
pot
pourri
and
apple
cinnamon
pie
for
the
flavor
i
found
it
to
be
pleasantly
sour
and
tart
like
apple
cider
vinegar
and
with
plenty
of
that
farmhouse
funky
yeast
taste
it
was
very
fizzy
lightbodied
and
crisp
almost
enough
to
make
me
pucker
in
the
end
the
only
slight
criticism
i
had
was
that
i
noticed
a
slight
vegetalherbal
hint
intermingled
deep
within
the
other
flavors
that
i
was
not
so
sure
about
i
definitely
want
to
have
another
though
and
would
highly
recommend
this
to
those
that
like
sours
needs
more
strength
weak
overall
solid
not
bad
at
all
a
good
funky
saison
will
i
get
through
the
whole
22oz
shouldnt
be
an
issue
not
sure
ill
be
chasing
this
one
down
in
the
future
though
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
flavorful
for
being
lighter
in
body
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
it
has
little
to
no
complexity
littleno
malt
presence
to
play
with
the
acidity
light
funk
even
after
being
a
year
old
pretty
onenote
acidity
disappointing
o
above
average
but
not
a
knockout
i
am
excited
to
try
more
jolly
pumpkin
ales
though
o
im
not
a
fan
of
jolly
pumpkins
regular
bam
biere
but
this
version
is
far
from
bad
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
i
could
see
myself
serving
this
as
a
table
beer
at
fall
gatherings
overall
i
think
i
scored
this
a
bit
higher
than
i
should
have
but
i
can
justify
it
by
saying
this
is
my
first
ever
dark
saison
to
me
it
was
very
unique
even
though
i
personally
feel
like
it
wasnt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
scored
it
a
little
higher
for
that
reason
dont
get
me
wrong
its
tasty
and
looksfeels
great
but
im
not
too
impressed
considering
the
price
tag
on
this
one
its
also
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
if
this
is
any
sign
about
how
the
rest
of
their
beers
are
i
cant
really
see
myself
spending
close
to
20
a
750ml
bottle
again
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
bubbly
patches
of
lace
form
quickly
fade
off
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
sour
and
tart
with
some
fruit
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
spices
lingering
slightly
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
and
i
think
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
overall
pretty
good
a
bit
thin
in
terms
of
flavour
but
enjoyable
the
mix
of
roasted
malt
and
sour
is
not
common
and
is
a
nice
change
but
isnt
a
perfect
combo
this
seems
like
the
basic
base
jolly
pumpkin
the
completely
unique
jp
yeast
is
very
apparent
just
not
among
their
elite
imo
3
words
to
sum
it
up
oaky
roasty
light
this
is
definitely
not
rated
high
enough
on
here
a
perfect
example
of
a
dark
saison
bordering
on
a
sour
beautiful
pour
light
translucent
brown
with
a
lasting
tan
head
smells
like
brett
lots
of
funk
perfect
nose
for
a
saison
flavor
really
features
the
brett
the
darker
malts
used
and
some
really
interesting
yeast
almost
a
wild
ale
maybe
it
is
a
wild
ale
actually
seems
like
it
i
like
the
dark
malts
in
this
beer
not
a
common
style
as
far
as
i
know
feel
is
good
a
little
thin
on
the
body
and
on
the
alcohol
content
too
it
could
have
been
like
a
7
2
beer
pretty
easily
and
for
the
price
maybe
it
should
have
been
still
its
light
and
drinkable
despite
its
complexity
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
aftertaste
is
delicious
overall
this
might
not
be
as
good
as
the
la
roja
but
its
a
realy
good
beer
jolly
pumpkin
is
moving
up
my
list
taste
is
quite
hoppy
in
a
belgian
way
once
again
there
are
dark
notes
such
as
prunes
or
raisin
very
carbonated
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
distinctive
beer
as
usual
jolly
pumpkin
makes
good
beer
forgot
to
rate
this
when
i
had
it
bottle
at
the
brewpub
in
a2
pours
a
dark
brown
with
white
head
aroma
of
breadth
malts
with
lots
of
yeast
candy
sugar
dark
fruits
and
ever
so
slight
hints
of
chocolate
flavor
follows
with
dark
fruits
and
lots
of
yeast
plenty
of
carbonation
and
pretty
easy
drinking
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
flavorful
but
overall
a
nice
beer
d
this
is
certainly
sessionable
but
its
just
not
got
enough
of
a
flavor
profile
its
somewhat
unique
and
more
acidic
than
id
expect
for
a
saison
overall
this
is
a
nice
fresh
easy
drinking
dinner
beer
cant
say
ill
buy
again
though
this
beer
is
a
rich
brownruddy
red
colored
liquid
with
a
thin
filmlike
lighttan
head
the
aroma
a
spritzy
citric
scent
has
a
fleeting
hop
character
and
a
slight
yeasty
funk
lemon
backed
with
a
slight
sugar
scent
and
a
wood
barrel
smell
are
also
notable
the
taste
is
refreshingly
tart
with
a
subdued
sweetness
and
malt
underbelly
wineline
in
the
finish
which
is
crisp
and
a
bit
effervescent
drier
than
expected
given
the
foretaste
not
bad
at
all
d
im
sure
it
had
more
going
on
when
fresh
but
now
it
is
fairly
onedimensional
sort
of
a
light
thin
tart
flanders
not
that
it
is
bad
it
is
very
interesting
with
lots
of
flavor
in
a
sharp
profile
but
it
is
a
bit
too
much
to
enjoy
drinking
by
itself
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
this
that
is
this
old
then
try
it
with
some
dinner
by
itself
the
carbonation
dryness
take
even
the
low
abv
right
to
your
head
plus
the
intense
tartsour
flavor
jeez
maybe
its
best
use
is
to
share
it
with
friends
as
an
aperitif
or
digestif
with
a
good
meal
it
would
be
good
for
that
very
light
on
the
palate
for
sure
the
lightest
sour
ive
had
overall
a
great
treat
to
find
on
draft
anywhere
regardless
of
the
season
quite
sessionable
for
the
abv
and
quite
falvorful
as
well
nothing
revolutionary
here
just
a
really
solid
dark
saison
this
pours
an
amberred
color
with
tight
lacing
clear
with
no
sediment
tart
aroma
with
hints
of
sour
cherries
rounding
it
out
nuanced
flavor
nothing
really
stands
out
or
overpowers
the
palate
more
accurately
i
get
the
sour
cherries
and
an
earthy
oaky
tannic
taste
nice
mouthfeel
with
an
effervescence
that
keeps
it
light
the
sourtartness
isnt
strong
but
it
makes
its
presence
known
and
it
has
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
an
enjoyable
sipper
on
a
warm
spring
day
o
very
good
much
more
complex
than
bam
biere
wonderful
treat
o
very
enjoyable
fairly
new
bottle
but
i
needed
to
clear
out
room
in
the
fridge
sour
flavors
were
nice
but
not
heavy
handed
o
i
normally
really
dig
jp
beers
but
this
is
near
the
bottom
of
my
list
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
normally
expect
or
enjoy
o
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
and
it
seems
reasonably
well
balanced
one
of
the
better
american
craft
farmhouse
ales
drinkability
is
quite
high
with
this
one
given
the
mouthfeel
and
abv
i
like
the
drinkability
a
lot
o
a
fantastic
saison
with
a
unique
malt
character
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
standout
from
jolly
pumpkin
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
fun
a
chewy
and
rewarding
bottle
for
those
familiar
to
the
world
of
sour
beer
but
also
an
excellent
potential
introduction
for
the
uninitiated
recommended
drinking
aroma
is
fruity
mainly
apple
and
banana
with
a
yeasty
undertone
and
a
hint
of
miso
it
pours
a
rich
tempting
dark
mahogany
with
a
pale
tan
head
that
does
not
stick
around
too
long
flavor
is
mainly
fruity
like
sour
apple
with
banana
and
yeast
notes
and
a
hint
of
caramel
texture
is
fairly
fizzy
just
a
teensy
on
the
thin
side
but
still
good
this
was
interesting
but
seemed
to
lack
just
a
little
bit
on
the
feel
still
a
very
good
beer
that
brings
some
real
good
flavor
at
a
lower
abv
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
active
off
white
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
cap
black
as
oil
hue
nose
features
slight
sourness
tart
apple

and
slight
orange
taste
somewhat
earthy
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
finishes
to
the
dry
side
tasty
little
sour
ale
o
sour
ales
are
not
for
everyone
if
you
are
part
of
the
minority
i
would
defiantly
suggest
this
beer
i
believe
this
would
of
benefit
from
a
higher
alcohol
percentage
try
this
one
out
its
a
breath
of
fresh
air
poured
a
dark
brownburgundy
with
a
creamy
light

moderate

and
light

has
some
rockets
the
powdery

tart
candy
light
funk
and
tartness
and
lots

some
dark

right
off
the
bat
which
disappear
just
as
fast
and
turn

and
lemony

quickly

with
some

suggests
another

this

worth
a
try
overall
its
a
darn
tasty
treat
jolly

750s
rock
a
delicious
fruity
musty
barnyard
saison
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
especially
the
aroma
overall
i
cant
say
as
id
recommend
this
one
which
is
a
shame
as
the
first
half
of
the
taste
was
so
good
i
really
like
jp
beers
and
this
one
wont
discourage
me
from
trying
others
but
i
honestly
hope
there
was
just
something
wrong
here
this
beer
seems
to
be
completely
in
the
finish
thats
when
all
he
flavor
are
heightened
and
then
only
for
an
instant
overall
i
think
it
could
be
a
tad
more
complex
but
it
is
good
o
this
beer
just
did
not
work
for
me
it
makes
me
realize
that
beer
styles
have
an
abv
range
for
a
reason
i
think
the
low
abv
might
contribute
to
the
lack
of
flavorsoso
taste
i
was
disappointed
however
thats
what
trying
out
different
beers
is
all
about
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
and
give
kudos
to
this
brewery
for
making
such
a
unique
beer
maybe
i
need
to
try
it
again
to
be
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
overall
interesting
but
not
something
id
buy
again
the
dark
malts
muddle
the
flavors
a
lot
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
im
giving
it
a
good
score
it
really
grew
on
me
by
the
end
i
didnt
have
any
problems
finishing
off
the
750
on
my
own
that
said
i
still
expected
a
little
more
i
think
the
brett
overwhelmes
some
of
the
subtlenuanced
qualities
at
the
sticker
price
it
may
be
a
one
and
done
something
im
glad
i
tried
even
though
i
may
not
be
back
for
more
o
i
enjoyed
this
a
little
different
but
definitely
good
o
a
little
disappointing
nice
nose
spice
and
tartness
but
no
complexity
or
follow
up
lacking
the
flavor
profiles
i
have
come
to
expect
from
jp
i
would
drink
it
again
but
too
many
other
better
jp
offerings
to
seek
it
out
again
if
you
also
love
sour
beers
i
think
youll
also
be
pleased
with
this
one
overall
not
among
the
top
tier
of
jolly
pumpkins
this
one
is
missing
a
depth
of
flavor
compared
to
the
others
still
i
would
never
turn
away
a
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
one
is
no
exception
cheers
o
i
liked
this
pretty
well
not
as
complex
as
la
roja
yet
still
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
would
buy
this
again
o
a
decent
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
i
threw
back
the
bottle
with
no
issue
actually
the
dryness
kept
me
drinking
smells
great
and
is
very
appealing
i
would
definitely
try
this
style
again
this
was
a
real
good
one
my
first
experience
with
the
brewery
as
for
style
bam
noires
label
suggests
dark
farmhouse
ale
which
doesnt
sit
right
with
me
i
think
it
should
be
situated
between
biere
de
garde
and
west
flanders
red
o
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
complex
yet
delicate
flavorful
yet
insanely
drinkable
o
jolly
pumpkin
is
the
cantillon
of
america
being
funkydry
and
wellcarbonated
combined
with
the
good
fruit
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
a
good
one
to
drink
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
jolly
pumpkin
and
again
wish
i
had
tried
more
while
they
were
available
to
me
o
not
overly
complex
and
a
bit
thin
jd
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
one
for
about
fifteen
bucks
not
long
ago
poured
a
nice
crimson
color
with
a
good
offwhite
head
aromas
of
spice
earth
yeast
and
a
little
funk
light
bodied
and
slightly
tartfunky
with
flavors
of
yeast
fruit
and
earth
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
but
plan
on
trying
some
of
jolly
pumpkins
heavier
brews
glassware
tulip
im
all
for
crazy
flavors
and
sour
beers
demand
some
respect
for
stretching
the
mind
but
im
just
as
interested
in
a
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
which
this
isnt
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
d
this
sour
ale
demonstrates
that
the
intensity
of
sensory
qualities
can
be
restrained
rather
than
challenging
in
such
a
beer
while
it
does
not
present
itself
clearly
as
a
saison
it
does
represent
a
very
approachable
example
of
an
american
wild
ale
this
could
be
regarded
as
the
pilsner
of
soursnot
in
terms
of
appearance
or
other
particular
sensory
qualities
but
in
the
overall
cleanliness
that
is
evident
there
is
no
place
for
offflavors
to
hide
here
revealing
a
mild
but
focused
flavor
profile
that
shows
no
tendency
to
fatigue
the
palate
it
also
stands
out
for
its
sub5
abv
further
enhancing
its
approachable
and
forgiving
nature
the
bottle
wont
be
a
stretch
to
finish
overall
pretty
good
i
think
the
bam
biere
is
better
but
this
would
be
worth
coming
back
to
while
its
available
here
with
jolly
pumpkin
you
either
speak
their
language
or
dont
thats
the
bottom
line
if
you
like
musty
tart
funkiness
in
your
beer
youll
get
along
fine
that
being
said
bam
noire
does
not
hold
up
to
the
usual
standards
of
the
brewery
and
even
for
the
diehard
funkheads
out
there
might
be
worth
passing
on
if
only
for
a
different
less
contrived
offering
bam
noire
is
not
the
beer
that
i
signed
up
for
when
i
drank
it
it
is
a
dark
saison
which
is
unusual
but
sounded
interesting
to
me
however
as
i
am
realizing
with
many
jp
beers
it
tastes
very
much
like
all
of
the
other
beers
they
make
that
are
barrelaged
they
just
have
a
weird
funk
with
just
a
tinge
of
tartness
bam
noire
though
was
not
good
i
suspect
the
base
beer
before
barrel
treatment
was
probably
very
phenolic
and
plastic
tasting
from
fermentation
that
ran
too
hot
because
the
finished
beer
is
just
not
good
i
can
taste
the
fermentation
flaws
and
combined
with
the
barrel
it
tastes
like
old
water
passed
through
a
sun
soaked
plastic
hose
that
is
run
through
an
old
leather
glove
i
spent
a
fair
bit
of
money
on
this
beer
and
most
people
that
drank
it
agreed
that
it
was
not
good
one
of
the
few
occasions
that
i
have
drain
poured
a
beer
drinkability
i
dont
think
ill
be
searching
this
one
out
again
i
dont
think
the
roast
and
sour
flavors
blend
real
well
in
this
case
notes
not
a
bad
brew
but
its
probably
the
least
memorable
of
the
offerings
from
jolly
pumpkin
ive
tried
pours
a
deep
brownish
amber
color
with
a
good
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
fresh
oak
lots
of
florals
and
some
good
farmhouse
horse
blanket
stuff
the
flavor
has
a
nice
mild
sourness
throughout
with
some
light
caramel
sweetness
and
a
nicely
fruity
character
the
beer
is
generally
dry
all
around
maintaining
a
good
sharp
tartness
and
a
mild
but
pronounced
bitter
and
spicy
hoppiness
the
palate
is
very
spirzy
but
full
pours
a
dark
brown
cider
like
color
with
a
fluffy
two
to
three
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
faint
but
of
green
fruits
the
taste
is
tart
with
green
fruits
on
the
backend
and
cherries
up
front
with
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
mild
carbonation
drinability
is
good
it
is
a
very
easy
drink
overall
it
is
a
soild
beer
with
a
nice
flavor
and
an
easy
drink
easily
could
have
a
couple
the
tanginess
makes
it
a
little
less
drinkable
than
ideal
but
the
taste
itself
is
almost
irresistable
for
the
style
alcohol
level
is
very
low
so
that
helps
a
good
changeup
unique
beer
that
i
might
get
again
although
a
bit
expensive
in
ca
t
surprisingly
a
little
on
the
sour
side
which
was
nice
some
cherries
vinegar
and
some
woodiness
in
the
aftertaste
goes
down
smooth
d
i
normally
love
jp
beers
but
this
one
seems
to
be
quite
off
in
the
taste
department
not
offensive
but
really
no
reason
to
drink
it
drinkability
4
5
this
is
a
very
good
wild
ale
and
packs
a
huge
punch
considering
its
only
4
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
and
price
definitely
hurt
the
drinkability
of
this
one
however
the
flavor
and
aroma
will
keep
me
coming
back
as
it
warms
it
tasted
like
old
apples
and
pears
drink
cold
it
is
well
carbonated
almost
a
bit
too
much
not
very
complex
but
still
pleasing
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
im
not
going
to
buy
it
again
and
cant
really
see
myself
recommending
it
d
i
usually
really
like
jolly
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
was
not
something
i
can
honestly
say
i
truly
enjoyed
all
around
it
did
drink
pretty
good
though
overall
this
wasnt
my
favorite
but
nonetheless
it
makes
me
want
to
taste
other
jolly
offerings
d
not
my
favorite
of
the
jp
ales
it
is
refreshing
but
i
wouldnt
have
this
one
over
taste
tartness
obscures
the
dark
malts
a
bit
a
little
roasty
kind
of
has
some
porter
flavors
d
pretty
drinkable
even
for
a
saison
not
much
detracts
from
this
beer
it
is
simple
yet
complex
and
the
oak
aging
paired
with
the
dark
malts
turn
a
crisp
finish
into
a
smooth
one
clear
brownish
red
color
tan
head
thinish
but
very
lacey
moderate
to
mild
carbonation
intense
smoky
aroma
combined
with
powerful
musty
woody
leathery
aromas
very
earthy
flavor
starts
out
smoky
and
toasted
as
drink
goes
down
smokiness
fades
to
tartness
and
soured
flavors
delicious
contradicting
flavors
in
one
drink
amazing
how
flavors
transition
in
your
mouth
the
ending
tartness
of
the
drink
causes
it
to
feel
heavy
when
first
on
the
tongue
but
turns
into
a
light
refreshing
finish
and
over
all
awesome
beer
with
amazing
qualities
a
very
delicious
drinkable
beer
very
yummy
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
stuff
wish
it
had
some
sourness
perhaps
if
i
could
manage
to
hold
on
to
a
bottle
and
not
drink
immediately
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
nose
brings
forward
some
oak
mild
sourness
a
bit
of
roast
and
a
light
bit
of
funk
the
taste
pulls
back
quite
a
bit
and
shows
oak
and
funk
more
than
anything
else
the
taste
is
a
bit
funky
and
makes
the
oak
known
drinks
pretty
well
another
nice
jp
saison
notes
never
had
a
sour
dark
ale
before
at
least
not
one
that
was
soured
on
purpose
but
i
have
to
reiterate
that
i
dont
really
taste
the
dark
ale
through
the
funk
good
stuff
but
rather
drink
regular
ol
bam
d
this
was
an
interesting
beer
overall
the
flavor
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
nose
but
i
still
liked
it
the
beer
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
hangs
around
until
all
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
quite
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
along
with
some
dark
fruit
toffee
and
a
little
bit
of
brettanomyces
character
the
flavor
is
much
heavier
on
the
brett
as
i
get
a
lot
of
leather
and
orange
citrus
notes
as
well
as
lemons
a
slight
bit
of
funk
toffee
and
yeast
the
beer
is
very
dry
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
high
biting
carbonation
d
oh
yeah
easy
on
the
pallete
not
as
winesharp
as
a
grand
cru
top
notch
done
of
the
more
sessionable
jolly
pumpkin
beers
i
could
drink
this
all
day
pour
is
amber
murky
with
a
head
of
about
2
fingers
tight
nested
over
a
murky
head
nose
is
straw
and
lemon
grass
with
a
funky
bacterial
qualities
hiding
somewhere
in
the
back
palate
is
one
of
the
best
saison
table
beers
ive
had
quality
of
floral
hop
blended
with
lemon
grass
and
a
mineral
sour
qaulity
that
was
very
subtle
and
not
dominating
on
the
palate
the
malt
was
the
kicker
with
a
interesting
very
distinct
but
gentle
roastiness
the
feel
was
perfectly
meaty
with
the
mineral
sour
and
floral
brisk
leaving
a
very
dry
feeling
on
the
tongue
a
clean
earthy
bitter
that
was
not
at
all
strong
very
easy
to
drink
fantome
caliber
refreshing
and
sessionable
without
sacrificing
any
depth
of
flavor
on
the
contrary
a
unique
dark
saison
and
one
of
the
few
domestic
examples
that
i
find
similar
to
some
of
fantômes
offerings
quietly
top
tier
this
this
is
a
fantastically
easy
to
drink
beer
it
has
a
low
abv
yet
maintains
complexity
with
a
refreshing
feel
drinkability
this
is
exactly
what
a
drinkable
beer
is
for
me
at
this
point
in
my
craft
beer
appreciation
sour
funky
malty
carbonated
and
low
in
alcohol
for
generous
continuous
consumption
near
perfect
i
can
see
why
they
call
this
a
farmhouse
ale
there
are
plenty
of
barnyard
smells
here
starting
with
a
late
winter
silage
aroma
apple
and
sweet
cherry
are
also
here
a
wet
dog
is
here
as
well
very
mild
hops
aroma
too
this
beer
had
one
of
the
larges
heads
i
have
ever
witnessed
the
head
is
persistent
tan
and
has
plenty
of
lacing
color
is
medium
brown
with
red
highlights
translucent
with
slight
cloudiness
the
flavor
is
more
difficult
to
pin
down
sour
with
a
heavy
umami
presence
an
apple
seed
bitterness
settles
onto
the
roof
of
the
mouth
with
this
beer
a
very
long
finish
medium
carbonation
with
a
light
astringent
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
it
overall
it
is
a
very
different
beer
from
the
usual
lager
pales
ipas
stouts
porters
and
browns
i
am
used
to
i
will
give
the
brew
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
because
i
like
the
brewery
they
are
from
my
home
state
mi
and
if
you
have
been
reading
the
papers
lately
they
need
all
the
help
they
can
get
up
there
nice
rather
easy
drinking
beer
worth
seeking
out
as
are
most
jolly
pumpkin
beers
d
over
all
this
is
a
good
beer
sure
it
not
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
out
there
but
its
still
a
damn
fine
beer
that
i
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
worth
picking
up
sometime
to
try
sampled
a
750ml
bottle
from
batch
262263
it
poured
jet
black
with
a
khacki
colored
head
it
had
a
very
pleasant
fruitysour
aroma
to
it
the
taste
wasnt
as
appealing
as
the
aroma
there
was
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
not
very
much
of
a
finish
at
all
not
bad
but
not
great
either
for
almost
20
a
bottle
id
expect
more
than
this
served
up
a
cloudy
dark
tinged
walnut
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
the
aroma
is
subdued
with
some
brown
sugar
toffee
and
a
touch
of
musty
cellar
it
is
so
mild
that
even
giving
the
glass
a
swirl
really
does
not
lend
much
more
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
nice
tartness
and
more
brown
sugary
notes
there
is
some
dark
dried
fruit
in
there
as
well
but
i
really
have
to
search
for
it
a
slight
woodiness
and
touch
of
spice
also
manage
to
make
it
through
the
funky
tartness
as
it
warms
but
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
one
dimensional
it
is
almost
like
a
mild
but
with
funky
tartness
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
long
finish
that
may
just
be
its
finest
quality
drinkable
but
not
really
all
that
captivating
d
very
good
draft
stopped
in
the
brewery
and
had
a
little
sampler
of
several
beers
dark
red
rust
color
with
a
whitetan
head
slight
smoke
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
some
coffee
the
taste
is
just
ok
in
my
opinion
leather
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
it
seems
to
me
that
a
lot
of
these
jp
beers
have
a
very
similiar
profile
and
taste
with
slight
tweaks
just
really
not
blown
away
be
there
everyday
offerings
highly
drinkable
its
sweet
but
not
overpowering
due
to
the
tangy
its
relatively
low
alcohol
so
you
can
have
a
lot
i
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
full
cap
of
offwhite
head
leaving
decent
lacing
scent
is
of
sweet
fruits
from
apples
to
strawberry
with
a
noticeable
sourness
to
it
also
a
bit
of
fresh
hay
must
and
dried
grains
and
a
touch
of
fresh
bread
first
taste
is
noticeably
earthy
musty
and
sour
a
multitude
of
fruit
flavors
are
present
but
dont
add
a
whole
lot
a
sweetness
the
backbone
is
a
nice
fresh
dried
grain
hay
and
bread
taste
medium
bodied
for
the
style
slight
drying
quality
to
the
finnish
a
nice
beer
with
some
earthy
tastes
that
just
get
a
little
too
in
the
way
of
some
bright
qualities

reminds

a
bit
of
maple

aroma
is
of

in

interesting
taste
somewhat

very
acidic
with
some
roasted

and
dark

flavors
with
lots
of
sourness
especially
in
the
finish
light
mouthfeel
but
theres
plenty
of
flavor
there
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
though
its
not
what
i
would
usually
gravitate
to
a
wonderful
farmhouse
ale
pours
a
darker
color
than
most
farmhouses
and
exudes
a
fruity
plum
raisins
smell
upon
first
whiff
full
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
head
taste
is
very
smooth
with
hint
of
lemongrass
lingering
on
the
palate
goes
down
smooth
and
light
drinkability
i
really
like
this
one
and
could
drink
it
regularly
a
greta
combo
of
sweet
fruit
and
funk
jolly
pumpkin
is
becoming
my
favorite
maker
of
this
style
quite
nicely
textured
though
smooth
enough
if
anything
its
a
bit
thin
but
its
quite
slick
and
smooth
quite
drinkable
d
another
low
alcohol
offering
from
jp
the
ale
is
a
bit
more
vinegary
with
the
funk
and
stout
interplay
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
large
tan
head
it
is
copper
colored
which
is
dark
for
a
saison
but
expected
since
the
bottle
was
clearly
marked
dark
farmhouse
ale
the
aroma
is
that
tart
sour
wild
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
tartsour
as
well
but
just
slightly
the
darker
malt
does
not
play
a
large
role
in
the
taste
it
is
discernible
but
not
a
major
factor
it
is
a
lot
better
than
the
last
couple
of
saisons
i
have
had
overall
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
drinkability
my
second
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
another
good
one
provided
you
enter
with
the
understanding
that
they
make
sour
beer
irrespective
of
what
style
they
purport
to
be
making
i
think
you
wont
be
disappointed
an
interesting
brew
saison
im
not
sure
it
has
the
freshness
to
fit
the
canonical
style
even
with
its
interestingly
warped
skew
towards
the
dark
end
of
the
spectrum
to
give
it
some
leeway
it
feels
a
little
flat
on
the
palate
but
its
an
adventurous
and
unusual
beer
and
i
respect
that
d
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
the
beer
but
i
found
the
finish
to
become
a
bit
tiresome
and
drying
still
a
good
beer
but
not
jolly
pumpkins
best
drinkability
truly
interesting
brew
i
enjoyed
the
expereince
of
the
beer
but
unlikely
to
seek
out
again
maybe
drinkability
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
jolly
pumpkin
offering
yet
and
its
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
fast
favorites
the
flavors
are
solid
and
funkiness
and
tartness
is
a
little
mild
so
this
would
be
a
solid
beginner
beer
for
people
looking
to
get
into
the
style
the
abv
is
very
slight
and
more
than
manageable
at
4
3
drinkability
this
was
a
very
weird
beer
i
had
no
problem
finishing
it
but
i
wouldnt
ever
purchase
it
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
impression
decent
but
a
bit
onedimensional
with
the
sourness
m
dry
and
very
bubbly
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
light
and
airy
body
for
the
color
make
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
the
low
abv
is
odd
to
me
but
it
doesnt
really
hurt
this
beer
in
my
opinion
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
exists
this
dark
saison
has
almost
nothing
that
jolly
pumpkins
standard
saison
bam
biere
doesnt
have
outside
of
a
remarkably
dark
hue
they
are
essentially
the
same
beer
though
this
particular
batch
of
bam
noire
is
better
executed
than
the
last
bottle
of
bam
biere
that
i
had
if
you
like
jolly
pumpkins
other
saisons
then
you
will
like
this
one
i
had
this
on
tap
into
a
tulip
at
local
option
the
beer
is
a
hazy
light
straw
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
and
complex
earthy
floral
hops
with
a
ton
of
tartness
one
of
the
most
tart
saisons
ive
had
the
taste
is
a
let
down
its
super
tart
almost
like
a
wild
but
its
a
weird
floral
tart
that
isnt
very
good
a
very
disappointing
beer
d
another
very
good
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
i
am
some
what
confused
at
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
dark
malt
character
this
seems
to
be
a
slightly
less
attenuated
version
of
bam
bier
i
was
expecting
some
chocolate
or
roasted
notes
laid
on
top
of
the
saison
character
this
is
just
a
good
saison
with
a
dark
color
i
just
said
to
my
wife
if
your
eyes
were
closed
you
would
never
guess
the
color
with
all
of
that
still
a
recommended
beer
something
worth
seeking
out
with
almost
no
alcohol
presence
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
creamy
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
sour
lemonade
on
draught
at
the
wonderful
lord
hoboa
very
lovely
spiced
dark
ale
that
doesnt
lean
towards
sweet
tackiness
or
hoppy
saison
well
balanced
at
least
to
me
one
who
does
like
the
dark
lagers
hearty
ales
a
dark
ruby
brown
pour
with
1
finger
of
tan
foamy
head
and
some
sticky
lace
the
aroma
gives
telltale
dark
roasted
malts
with
good
grainy
bread
as
well
as
some
lambic
sour
and
spiced
plum
medium
bodied
smooth
and
wellbalanced
flavor
of
tart
sour
saison
qualities
with
dark
dunkelesque
lager
malt
and
some
spice
but
not
syrupy
good
for
a
slow
sipping
on
a
snowy
day
low
in
alcohol
but
good
to
ponder
things
with
next
time
in
a
tulip
glass
md
somewhat
creamy
feel
with
an
intersting
balance
of
high
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
not
sure
this
really
reminds
me
a
whole
lot
of
a
saison
but
i
dont
expect
much
in
terms
of
traditional
flavors
when
dealing
with
jp
beers
pours
a
dark
brown
ruby
color
with
about
an
inch
of
sandy
head
that
laces
ok
smell
is
a
bit
reserved
some
lemony
tart
notes
some
yeastiness
though
not
much
else
i
can
pull
out
taste
however
is
actually
pretty
good
in
my
book
theres
some
nice
tart
funky
notes
some
lighter
saisontype
fruit
notes
lemon
lime
orange
and
a
bit
of
the
darker
almost
spicy
notes
that
linger
in
the
background
a
bit
reserved
but
definitely
a
really
drinkable
beer
mf
is
bright
and
bubbly
with
some
decent
carbonation
dry
finish
lasting
aftertaste
i
actually
really
like
this
as
a
interesting
session
beer
like
a
sour
light
not
necessarily
worth
the
price
would
buy
this
all
the
time
at
6
would
prefer
la
roja
the
only
other
jp
brew
ive
had
at
this
point
but
not
bad
at
all
d
easy
to
drink
in
a
literal
sense
though
im
not
sure
id
want
to
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
a
jack
of
all
trades
but
the
reality
is
its
a
master
of
none
i
felt
that
the
beer
was
too
carbonated
the
mouthfeel
just
wasnt
right
this
was
really
the
weak
point
for
me
overall
id
probably
have
it
again
but
wouldnt
put
it
in
my
favorites
a
dark
amber
color
good
head
pretty
drinkable
just
not
my
favorite
d
all
that
being
said
i
can
drink
it
think
of
it
as
saison
lite
not
bad
but
not
a
saison
not
good
but
not
terrible
drinkability
was
good
you
must
be
a
fan
of
jps
brett
to
love
this
its
not
my
fave
as
i
prefer
the
classic
horseyness
of
dupont
but
its
quite
sessionable
and
enjoyable
a
nice
cheese
would
make
this
sing
more
decent
beer
but
could
use
some
significant
improvement
in
mf
d
drinkablity
is
exceptional
and
i
would
love
to
get
more
of
these
but
they
are
out
of
season
and
ive
bought
the
last
one
at
my
store
cheers
complete
surprise
we
thought
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
sweeter
rounded
saison
due
to
the
explanation
that
this
was
to
be
a
saison
noir
some
wild
yeast
and
spices
give
this
beer
a
very
prickly
mouthfeel
and
murky
ruby
complextion
this
really
reminds
me
of
orval
but
not
for
the
right
reasons
the
color
is
confusing
the
issue
and
its
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
unfortunately
we
went
for
the
750ml
so
we
have
some
work
to
do
between
the
two
of
us
12
is
a
bit
steep
for
an
experiment
with
somewhat
of
a
misleading
monicre
d
4
3
highly
drinkable
even
in
750
ml
format
have
it
with
a
cheese
plate
be
jolly
overall
it
was
easy
drinking
because
there
wasnt
much
to
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
cellared
it
for
over
a
year
but
really
only
the
barnyard
of
the
brett
stood
out
to
me
overall
this
is
a
very
strange
unique
and
interesting
beer
much
different
than
anything
i
could
have
expected
not
overly
sour
not
overly
dark
but
a
combination
of
those
two
characteristics
highly
unexpected
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
this
beer
was
not
amazing
but
did
really
grow
on
me
after
awhile
d
nice
beer
i
would
have
loved
to
put
it
side
by
side
with
a
bam
biere
i
would
drink
again
but
i
am
new
to
jolly
pumpkin
so
i
am
still
working
through
all
of
their
beers
now
that
its
back
to
warmer
saisontype
weather
here
in
formerlyfrozen
florida
this
is
an
excellent
choice
i
have
no
problem
with
lowerabv
saisons
at
all
better
than
the
regular
bam
biere
by
a
lot
per
my
reckoning
o
a
good
beer
that
i
will
enjoy
when
i
visit
jolly
pumpkin
in
ann
arbor
this
beer
is
definitely
exotic
for
my
palate
mahalo
beertracker
i
could
displace
all
of
the
oxygen
in
my
living
room
with
the
co2
in
this
bottle
and
ill
be
burping
for
years
to
come
the
dark
color
belies
a
very
solid
lighter
bodied
saison
highly
drinkable
and
on
a
par
with
some
of
jolly
pumpkins
other
outstanding
ales
d
an
interesting
farmhouse
whose
color
certainly
makes
you
do
a
double
take
a
wellmade
beer
that
i
think
is
overall
a
bit
more
successful
than
their
regular
bam
definitely
will
have
this
again
again
very
fond
of
how
this
one
tastes
compared
to
other
saisons
i
have
had
d
drinkable
hell
yes
overall
a
tasty
brew
but
needs
a
little
rounding
out
id
say
all
the
seperate
parts
are
good
but
they
dont
mix
as
well
as
they
could
hard
to
pinpoint
what
im
trying
to
say
so
ill
just
shutup
now
a
good
beer
drinkability
relatively
so
it
is
quite
a
low
abv
for
a
normal
craft
beer
but
that
does
not
mean
it
lacks
on
flavor
it
is
quite
flavorful
and
quite
quaffable
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
less
out
of
balance
the
earthyfunk
tones
are
and
the
more
i
am
enjoying
this
i
will
admit
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
jp
but
a
great
offering
nonetheless
enjoyable
beer
though
it
tastes
similar
to
other
brews
i
have
had
from
jp
and
not
much
like
a
saison
either
however
it
is
rather
drinkable
and
complex
and
is
admirably
low
in
alcohol
and
high
in
flavor
jolly
pumpkin
bam
noir
pours
a
finger
of
sticky
beige
foam
over
a
dark
brew
though
up
to
the
light
its
rosy
carbonation
is
massive
the
nose
is
the
now
familiar
cidery
jolly
pumpkin
funk
with
a
tingle
of
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
very
tart
lightlytoasted
malts
oak
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
off
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
very
very
dry
and
also
very
light
and
crisp
do
in
equal
parts
to
that
tartness
picked
up
from
their
barrel
aging
and
the
high
carbonation
not
for
everyone
but
if
youve
gotten
a
taste
for
a
bit
of
sourness
this
is
an
okay
one
notes
had
seen
this
several
times
in
bottles
before
today
nice
to
have
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
d
i
let
this
beer
warm
for
at
least
10
minutes
before
tasting
it
and
at
that
point
i
initially
found
it
a
little
lacking
as
it
was
seemingly
one
very
basic
flavor
combination
mostly
brett
characteristics
and
fruit
but
as
it
warmed
it
opened
up
and
became
much
more
interesting
and
the
yeast
pour
added
some
complexity
to
it
to
be
sure
but
even
then
it
was
still
not
that
rich
or
involved
i
enjoyed
it
mainly
for
the
strawlike
horseblanket
mineral
and
tart
contributions
of
the
brettanomyces
and
the
oak
but
it
never
got
off
the
ground
so
id
say
that
its
better
than
the
bam
e
s
b
but
ill
take
any
other
jolly
pumpkin
before
this
one
on
a
wider
scale
its
ok
its
at
least
interesting
it
has
a
place
in
the
world
overall
pretty
disappointing
i
felt
like
there
could
be
so
much
more
such
great
potential
in
the
idea
of
this
beer
but
really
poor
follow
through
at
least
in
this
bottle
drinkability
this
beer
is
incredibly
well
balanced
and
refreshing
it
has
dark
flavors
and
has
the
most
impressive
acidity
with
well
integrated
hop
profiles
the
levels
of
malt
are
subtle
and
the
beer
finishes
dry
this
beer
would
be
an
impecable
pairing
for
pulled
pork
or
fresh
bacon
j
overall
a
really
good
beer
from
jp
they
continue
to
amaze
me
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
good
strong
bite
notes
well
i
could
tell
from
the
nose
that
this
beer
wasnt
going
to
provide
enough
funk
to
satisfy
me
but
the
lack
of
brett
on
my
palate
was
ridiculous
add
to
that
the
bitter
astringency
the
lack
of
interesting
flavors
the
absence
of
good
carbonation
and
the
thin
watery
feel
and
youve
got
yourself
a
beer
that
utterly
fails
to
impress
me
im
quite
disappointed
with
this
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
very
sour
and
very
tart
with
a
solid
yet
soft
malt
undercurrent
that
seems
to
weld
everything
together
this
is
a
very
inviting
aroma
for
someone
who
loves
wild
beers
and
in
fact
it
makes
my
checks
pucker
and
my
mouth
water
the
taste
is
mellower
in
the
sourtartness
but
it
is
still
noticeable
the
malt
is
a
lot
more
pronounced
too
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
add
anything
to
the
beer
the
taste
is
nice
but
not
great
like
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
watery
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
think
it
would
benefit
if
the
taste
were
even
just
a
little
more
sour
light
citrus
simple
sour
flavors
not
much
of
anything
for
this
one
a
pleasant
light
simple
citrus
brew
but
not
worthy
of
jolly
pumpkin
best
thing
about
this
one
is
the
cool
label
by
the
way
its
not
really
bad
its
just
not
good
it
tastes
sort
of
like
a
lightly
spiced
lightly
sour
less
sweet
7up
quite
dry
and
malty
textures
offer
creaminess
up
front
and
then
dries
considerably
and
creates
moderate
astringencies
in
the
finish
challenging
but
pleasant
and
refreshing
beginning
to
end
it
cant
overcome
the
overwhelming
crushing
sense
of
dryness
theres
some
promise
here
and
i
like
the
original
bam
but
nothing
steps
up
flavorwise
to
complete
it
12

it
is
always
in

does
not

this
works

tart

glad
to
see
this
stuff
is
available
in
california
now
will
be
drinking
again
add
another
solid
brew
to
jolly
pumpkins
lineup
that
i
have
had
now
recommended
one
finger
tan
head
that
killed
quick
dark
brownblack
body
oak
on
the
nose
oak
on
the

dry
and
slightly
sour
not
much
in
flavor
or
complexity
minimal
lacing
decent
sour
not
really
interesting
considering
the
dark
malts
could
have
added
much
more
to
it
disappointed
in
this
jp
they
cant
all
be
winners
this
may
have
some
oldschool
saison
qualities
but
its
not
what
i
think
of
when
the
word
saison
comes
to
mind
it
drinks
a
little
slower
than
your
average
saison
the
vinegar
tones
and
the
darkish
fruit
a
little
apple
and
prune
maybe
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
clove
slow
it
up
a
bit
definitely
am
guessing
that
jp
accomplished
what
it
wanted
to
here
cause
there
are
no
true
flaws
to
me
i
just
dont
enjoy
it
as
a
representative
of
the
saison
style
drinkability
is
good
might
be
a
touch
to
tart
with
out
enough
going
on
to
back
it
up
still
enjoyable
though
might
not
be
on
par
with
other
jolly
pumpkins
i
have
had
but
enjoyable
just
the
same
drinkablilty
is
only
ok
here
i
am
just
not
a
jolly
pumpkin
type
of
drinker
i
dont
mind
a
little
sour
bite
in
my
saison
so
i
found
this
to
be
plenty
drinkable
i
had
this
on
tap
in
the
jolly
pumpkin
brewpub
just
north
of
traverse
city
i
would
agree
with
most
reviewers
that
it
is
definitely
an
aquired
taste
as
are
all
jp
beers
this
is
belgian
in
style
and
contains
plenty
of
funk
this
beer
is
high
in
carbonation
and
has
a
wonderful
brown
color
the
tartness
could
be
unpleasant
if
it
is
unexpected
i
would
have
no
problem
using
this
as
a
session
beer
the
lighter
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
summer
even
though
the
color
says
fall
keep
up
the
good
work
ron
theres
something
off
with
this
brew
it
seems
way
too
carbonated
which
might
be
the
root
of
the
problem
this
is
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
and
i
cant
even
finish
it
its
a
sour
little
bitch
with
no
real
qualities
that
can
be
enjoyed
other
than
the
aroma
epic
fail
in
my
opinion
ill
just
pray
that
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
by
judging
from
some
other
reviews
it
seems
unlikely
overall
not
my
favorite
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
still
an
ok
brew
worth
a
look
but
dont
put
much
effort
into
your
hunt
750ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
murky
bubbly
dark
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
lighttan
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
amount
of
funky
fruit
with
a
touch
of
brown
malt
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
a
very
intriguing
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
fruits
with
the
textbook
brett
funkiness
and
a
hint
of
brown
malt
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
i
must
say
this
one
is
a
truly
unique
beer
quite
enjoyable
drinability
the
abv
is
spot
on
but
the
sourness
could
make
this
a
slightly
difficult
to
session
if
you
are
looking
for
something
unique
this
is
the
ticket
definitely
not
for
the
neophyte
great
drinkability
especially
with
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
but
crisp
carbonation
interesting
and
really
nice
beer
if
this
is
a
saison
as
anyone
would
come
to
expect
from
jolly

pours
out
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
massive
head
i
mean
inches
with
loose
clingy
bubbles
that
stay
around
leaving
traces
all
along
the
side
of
the
glass
the
color
is
not
very
traditional
but
i
cant
help
but
think
this
one
is
beautiful
the
smell
is
fairly
straightforwardly
funky
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
jp
you
cant
exactly
smell
the
dark
malts
underneath
but
you
notice
it
when
you
taste
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
from
the
first
sip
you
notice
this
brilliant
caramel
sweetness
almost
backed
with
a
bit
of
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
almost
vanilla
and
it
finishes
wonderfully
tart
the
perfect
balance
so
that
the
tartness
sweetness
and
dark
malts
never
come
unbalanced
you
know
what
i
think
this
tastes
like
tamarind
i
think
this
will
be
one
of
my
subjective
score
beers
since
ive
never
seen
anything
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
never
unpleasantly
so
thats
about
all
i
can
complain
about
and
at
4
3
i
could
drink
this
forever
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
creamy
head
that
slowly
dissipates
scent
of
citrus
and
cherry
flavor
is
overwhelmed
by
the
citrus
lemon
flavor
and
hides
any
presence
of
malt
or
hops
the
citrus
does
however
lend
itself
to
making
this
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
i
would
gladly
have
another
one
of
these
but
with
so
many
other
farmhouse
ales
saisons
that
i
havent
tried
it
may
be
a
while
before
i
get
back
to
this
one
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
color
with
a
huge
loose
tan
colored
head
that
left
some
rocky
lacing
and
a
rocky
cap
settles
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
lemony
tart
green
apples
and
some
farmhouse
funk
horse
blanket
etc
the
taste
starts
off
quite
tart
very
lemony
with
unripe
granny
smith
apple
not
much
of
the
farmhouse
in
the
flavor
a
mild
malt
presence
helps
cut
the
tartness
moderate
body
with
soft
carbonation
a
tad
dry
if
tart
is
your
thing
that
this
is
one
you
want
to
pick
up
i
find
that
the
tartness
just
kills
the
other
flavors
for
me
and
its
basically
all
i
taste
didnt
really
remind
me
of
a
saison
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
good
character
and
a
lively
personality
m
very
thin
bodied
mild
carbonation
md
i
tend
to
gravitate
towards
the
jp
products
that
have
something
going
for
them
aside
from
the
funk
and
this
one
does
fit
that
description
overall
mild
for
a
sour
interesting
and
priced
so
i
would
only
recommend
it
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sour

its

a

to

i
am
slightly
biased

the

i
love
everything
jolly

you
should
be
checking

with
tart
vinous
notes
unripe
cherry
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
mix
flavor
isnt
quite
as
deep
or
complex
still
some
bitter
fruit
up
front
and
a
mild
chocolate
sweetness
plus
a
very
peppery
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
overcarbonated
at
first
but
after
some
swirling
and
breathing
it
comes
down
to
a
normal
level
mouthfeel
is
light
and
arid
with
fast
moving
carbonation
this
one
floats
over
the
palate
and
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
too
bad
its
freezing
right
now
in
chicago
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
of
a
robust
flavor
here
but
in
the
end
its
still
a
tasty
variation
of
bam
pairs
well
with
some
6
year
old
cheddar
as
well
overall
a
solid
offering
i
like
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
better
including
the
regular
bam
biere
this
was
a
tasty
beer
ive
never
had
a
dark
saison
before
but
this
one
definitely
spoiled
the
style
for
me
in
the
best
possible
way
pours
a
dark
brown
cola
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
subtle
funk
to
this
one
some
notes
of
coffee
and
faint
chocolate
sweetness
grassy
dry
hops
and
coffee
cream
round
this
one
out
not
overly
huge
on
flavor
mild
and
very
drinkable
light
medium
bodied
i
recommend
this
over
the
bam
biere
even
though
both
beers
are
exceptional
carbonation
is
huge
and
really
too
much
beneath
the
bubbles
there
seems
to
be
a
thin
watery
complexion
disappointing
brew
really
goes
down
fine
but
the
brett
just
takes
over
and
possibly
ruins
something
more
enjoyable
beneath
it
all
i
really
like
this
saison
its
really
funky
and
quite
different
at
such
a
low
abv
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
definitely
recommended
d
not
really
working
for
me
theres
a
lot
of
flavour
in
this
but
isnt
quite
right
theres
just
no
life
in
this
beer
it
doesnt
pop
and
doesnt
excite
so
i
take
over
a
month
off
from
reviewing
beers
and
this
is
what
i
am
welcomed
back
with
goody
me
i
dont
quite
recall
where
i
bought
this
bottle
at
chicago
kansas
city
i
know
it
wasnt
omaha
because
i
am
boycotting
carrying
jps
at
beertopia
at
the
moment
i
hope
that
changes
while
i
am
not
crazy
about
most
of
their
beers
a
good
number
of
people
are
i
respect
jb
i
get
their
beers
i
understand
their
niche
i
dont
understand
this
beer
major
dud
avoid
jp
keep
their
rep
and
theme
with
this
beer
but
its
smoothness
is
welcome
in
the
wake
of
their
other
beers
ive
had
shes
a
keeper
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
saison
and
a
decent
sour
ale
it
ranks
lower
down
on
my
list
of
jp
beers
but
its
nice
to
see
the
brewery
continuing
to
push
the
boundaries
of
style
with
something
unconventional
taste
is
nearly
a
180

the
smell

the
fruitiness

5

over

so
i
will
be
doing
it
very
slowly
to
see
some
significant
changes
hopefully
its
quite
refreshing
and
supremely
drinkable
just
not
quite
as
complex

solid
of
a
brew
as
the
original

you
michigan

are

this

oneinch
offwhite

dissipated
gradually
into
a
thin
consistent
skim
of
algae
sheets
of
lacing
with
good
retention
present
during
the
tasting
scents
were
difficult
to
tease
out
but
first
impression
was
sour
and
winelike
flavor
was
also
subdued
more
sour
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
as
well
some
oakiness
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
cabernet
consistency
fell
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
bodied
but
effervescence
helped
round
out
the
mouthfeel
nicely
and
finish
was
fairly
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
sourness
lingering
drinkability
was
fair
not
my
favorite
offering
from
jp
but
not
bad
however
just
not
that
much
going
on
with
this
one
the
low
abv
aids
drinkability
but
this
is
an
expensive
beer
that
goes
down
quick
sorry
all
but
this
beer
is
dreadful
i
bought
this
a
few
weeks
ago
tried
it
and
thought
surely
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
and
i
should
try
again
well
i
bought
another
bottle
over
the
weekend
and
the
second
time
the
beer
is
consistent
with
the
first
so
statistically
it
is
very
unlikely
that
i
have
two
bad
bottles
the
taste
is
vinegar
really
potent
yeast
and
just
undrinkable
im
getting
nothing
but
really
strong
pungent
astringent
vinegar
malt
caramel
warming
notes
i
dont
detect
anything
of
the
sort
i
liked
the
other
jolly
pumpkins
i
just
dont
know
what
in
the
world
the
brewmaster
was
trying
to
get
at
with
this
awful
concoction
down
the
drain
it
goes
its
just
too
bad
i
spent
12
to
do
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
overly
so
the
body
of
this
one
clearly
needs
to
be
thicker
carbonation
is
good
and
it
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
id
be
more
inclined
to
drink
more
if
it
had
a
better
taste
overall
its
interesting
and
certainly
worth
a
try
but
its
clearly
a
far
cry
from
what
it
couldve
been
pours
slightly
cloudy
dark
brown
and
red
an
inch
of
thick
foam
settles
to
a
persistent
finger
of
head
and
nice
clingy
lace
the
house
yeast
produces
a
fragrantly
sour
beer
the
aroma
is
laced
with
orange
pepper
lemon
and
light
cocoa
notes
as
well
the
flavor
is
less
exciting
tart
lemon
and
lime
flavors
are
carried
on
a
husky
malt
and
cocoa
bean
base
these
make
for
a
slightly
odd
and
thin
combination
pretty
light
in
body
as
well
with
abundant
carbonation
drinks
easily
but
isnt
the
most
successful
jolly
pumpkin
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
low
for
a
saison
and
for
a
wild
ale
its
still
a
bit
below
average
just
not
that
tasty
and
i
consider
myself
a
big
fan
of
brett
beers
and
saisons
are
my
absolute
favorite
style
stick
to

very
mellow
mouthfeel
nice
and
clean
high
carbonation
level
as
for
its
drinkability
i
would
always
drink
anything
from
jolly
pumpkin
especially
if
you
are
into
sours
and
farmhouse
style
beers
d
this
is
a
unique
and
complex
beer
owing
to
the
extremely
earthy
flavor
and
the
sourness
the
flavor
is
actually
fairly
mild
though
and
refreshing
its
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
low
alcohol
content
but
still
a
sipper
for
me
because
of
the
strangeness
of
the
flavor
im
kinda
on
the
fence
with
this
one
its
good
enough
to
drink
once
and
an
interesting
taste
experience
but
it
also
kinda
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
an
interesting
take
on
this
style
drinkability
between
the
yeasty
funk
and
the
tartness
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
if
you
were
in
the
mood
you
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
and
unlike
most
of
the
big
beers
we
spend
most
of
our
time
tasting
you
might
not
end
up
on
the
floor
750ml
bottle

into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
black
black
color
with
a
large
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
possesses
great
retention
and
lacing
characteristics
the
aroma
is
a
little
tart
and
acidic
with
some
dark
malt
cocoa
yeast
and
a
touch
of
funkiness
the
taste
is
tart
with
some
malt
cocoa
and
yeast
with
a
dry
earthy
finish
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tart
dry
light
cocoa
vanilla
oak
and
citrus
d
a
nice
beer
from
jp
great
with
a
steak
its
acidity
cut
through
the
gamey
flavours
and
the
dark
malt
complemented
the
roasted
flavours
of
the
meat
a
beer
i
would
have
again
but
11
49
for
a
750
is
a
little
much
all
and
all
a
good
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
like
this
one
as
i
said
as
a
contrast
to
some
of
the
big
beers
ive
been
having
i
could
have
a
good
session
with
this
brew
theres
some
kind
of
cola
coffee
smell
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
its
definitely
there
its
not
jiving
with
me
though
taste
is
the
aforementioned
cola
and
coffee
with
a
bunch
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
noncloying
im
a
huge
jolly
pumpkin
fan
but
this
is
by
far
my
least
favorite
of
their
offerings
d

oh
yeah
not
necessarily
a
session
but
damn
near
large
bottle
batch
255
moderatly
sour
but
it
is
not
as
subtle
or
complex
i
would
expect
that
with
some
additional
aging
it
might
compare
more
favorably
nickflfeb

and
ive
had
all
of
them
now
but
the
reserve
beers
this
one
deep
reddish
brown
beer
the
foam
was
really
sticky
with
good
head
retention

5dont
think
this
is
a
brew
i
would
return
to
again
i
felt
bitterness
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
then
this
nasty
funkiness
with
some
significant
haze
aroma
is
dark
fruits
straw
and
peppery
spices
the
finish
is
tart
and
short
with
a
spicy
aftertaste
above
average
overall

maybe
a

ive
got
mixed
emotions
on
this
one
its
an
easy
drinker
right
now
but
i
would
like
to
see
something
bigger
for
this
style
cabsandkingdec
02
now
this
is
a
beer
i
could
get
used
to
i
could
make
a
heck
of
a
session
out
of
this
guy
it
combines
the
best
aspects
of
a
saison
and
a
porter
with
any
conflicts
that
might
arise
being
dealt
with
by
enough
funk
that
you
cant
notice
any
problems

so
i

this
isnt
a
huge
surprise
for
me
different
but
interesting

light
body
and
mouthfeel
i
like
the
smell
slightly
sour
taste
that
is
still
complex
and
very
similar
to
bam
biere
after
a
second
bottle
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
with
a
nice
tart
spicy
brew
go
down
there
is
an
acidic
mustard
and
overspiced
applesauce
flavors
potentially
perfect
in
the
right
context
quite
chuggable
for
such
a
complicated
beer

with

scorched

come
through

the

moderate

with
a

refreshing
and
with
