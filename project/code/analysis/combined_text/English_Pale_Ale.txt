one
of
my
favorite
friends
from
across
the
pond
sessionable
very
drinkable
i
even
love
the
bottles
to
me
its
the
perfect
beverage
ive
been
drinking
it
since
1982
when
i
was
stationed
in
england
while
in
the
us
air
force
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
even
for
an
english
pale
ale
the
astringency
is
overpowering
and
unpleasant
and
i
had
not
had
any
beer
let
alone
a
pale
ale
with
such
a
strong
caramel
flavor
however
i
suspect
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
the
color
was
darker
than
most
others
described
it
the
astringency
was
overpowering
even
for
an
english
pale
ale
the
hops
were
nonexistent
and
it
really
just
seemed
off
im
leaving
this
review
for
future
comparison
to
other
english
pale
ales
ive
had
much
better
from
sam
smiths
id
like
to
try
this
in
england
possibly
this
was
likely
an
old
bottle
bottle
purchased
from
oak
vine
on
16
ave
in
calgary
only
place
so
far
in
this
city
i
have
found
this
classic
pours
an
amazing
bronze
amber
hue
almost
marmalade
orange
with
a
lot
of
white
foam
i
had
to
rush
to
contain
the
initial
fizzy
blast
but
things
very
quickly
settled
down
aroma
was
heady
and
multifaceted
with
sweet
malts
stone
fruits
and
earthy
hops
predominating
this
beer
is
a
classic
quintessential
english
ale
with
ample
character
and
complexity
earthy
woody
english
hops
lead
the
way
with
a
hint
of
apricot
goldings
aroma
against
a
rich
toffee
backdrop
considerable
crystal
malt
sweetness
but
a
lot
of
hop
character
to
provide
balance
some
sour
crabapple
and
marmalade
citrus
flavors
add
complexity
dark
fruit
raisin
character
and
diacetyl
butterscotch
emerge
in
the
finish
along
with
a
mineral
bite
and
old
wine
fermented
notes
great
tapestry
of
english
beer
flavors
body
medium
thick
with
a
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
lots
of
residual
sugars
here
i
am
an
unabashed
samuel
smith
fan
and
this
is
one
of
the
classics
of
the
genre
bottles
may
come
off
as
a
bit
old
in
flavor
but
the
overall
effect
is
that
of
a
timeless
examplar
of
one
of
the
great
beer
styles
of
the
world
o
an
outstanding
pale
highly
recommended
for
those
that
dont
care
to
be
bombarded
with
ibus
a
delicious
herbal
flavor
a
well
executed
authentic
pale
ale
sweet
malty
aroma
with
notes
of
burnt
sugar
or
molasses
appearance
is
bright
clear
copper
with
a
light
relatively
fastdissipating
head
flavour
is
quite
sweet
with
a
strong
hoplayered
finish
that
lingers
and
hints
at
toffee
the
balance
is
slightly
toward
bitter
but
a
wellbalanced
beer
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
generally
light
and
effervescent
and
contrasts
sharply
with
the
complexities
within
the
malt
and
hop
flavours
old
brewery
pale
ale
pours
a
darker
cooper
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
floral
aroma
with
a
creamy
note
that
is
full
of
nut
and
toffee
notes
but
its
enjoyable
the
taste
has
some
floral
notes
but
it
has
a
very
unique
okay
undertone
and
the
flavor
has
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
strong
nut
and
toffee
flavors
easy
to
drink
just
a
tad
watery
overall
its
a
pale
with
some
very
unique
flavors
overall
a
very
enjoyable
english
pale
samuel
smiths
brewery
seems
to
do
nothing
bad
they
just
have
more
offerings
that
are
better
a
solid
english
pale
ale
but
not
my
most
favorite
pale
and
definitely
not
my
most
favorite
from
this
brewery
you
should
try
this
at
least
once
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
decent
offering
from
samuel
smith
but
i
find
it
a
bit
lacking
there
are
better
examples
out
there
the
glory
of
these
beers
is
their
price
less
than
4
bucks
per
go
are
you
kidding
me
the
quality
to
price
point
is
unrivaled
in
the
beer
world
while
some
are
outstanding
standard
setters
others
are
just
okay
this
pale
ale
is
somewhere
in
between
its
clear
in
the
pours
more
red
than
copper
with
a
finger
of
off
white
bubbles
that
pop
down
to
a
thin
skin
before
long
the
nose
is
quintessentially
english
with
all
the
caramel
malt
dusty
attic
you
could
ever
want
but
with
a
welcomed
touch
of
vanilla
extract
the
yeast
doesnt
really
manifest
itself
until
the
flavor
neither
do
the
hops
the
yeast
combines
with
the
caramel
malt
to
give
a
doughy
cereal
profile
while
the
hops
finish
the
beer
nice
and
bitter
balancing
the
vanilla
expertly
tastes
just
a
tad
old
at
the
end
but
ill
bet
this
is
nearly
perfect
at
the
source
on
tap
thinner
body
which
im
back
and
forth
between
liking
and
not
and
airy
carbonation
that
keeps
this
beer
drinking
easily
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
from
sam
smiths
but
now
that
i
have
worked
my
well
into
their
lineup
i
can
safely
say
that
the
quality
of
this
brew
is
up
to
the
high
bar
of
the
others
again
the
economics
cannot
be
beat
o
i
have
been
really
into
the
english
session
ales
lately
and
this
one
is
another
treat
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
might
be
spoton
for
the
style
but
i
found
it
rather
boring
if
you
have
an
affinity
for
british
session
ales
this
might
be
your
cup
of
tea
rjt
you
have
to
try
this
beer
as
it
is
pretty
affordable
and
a
classic
get
out
there
drink
good
beer
life
is
too
short
for
the
mundane
3
85
00
but
my
bet
is
i
am
going
to
find
better
at
a
cheaper
price
still
when
in
doubt
this
brew
is
fine
overall
decent
but
not
nearly
as
special
as
everyone
else
seems
to
think
the
reddishbrown
of
this
excellent
beer
looked
very
nice
but
the
soontofollow
aroma
oh
it
was
impressive
the
caramelized
malty
character
shows
itself
so
well
but
yet
so
unobtrusively
we
also
have
a
background
tofeelike
smell
the
controlled
bitterness
at
the
beginning
which
precedes
an
unexpected
but
real
carbonation
impression
at
the
palate
is
very
soothing
actually
in
the
end
the
hops
appear
more
clearly
which
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
fantastic

45
t
this
isnt
the
hop
bomb
ive
come
to
look
for
in
pale
ales
but
its
sneaky
good
some
toasted
caramel
malt
honey
malt
and
grain
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
some
fruity
esters
linger
in
the
background
finish
is
squeaky
clean
super
drinkable
o
a
good
little
english
pale
with
a
nice
profile
and
great
drinkability
worthy
of
the
name
and
a
purchase
malty
beer
traditional
english
pale

dont
look
for
complexity
second
time
i
tried
and
this
one
didnt
go
well
maybe
because
i
had
it
too
warm
i
will
need
to
give
it
a
new
try
o
there
seems
to
be
a
decent
reason
why
i
looked
past
this
brew
for
such
a
long
time
the
other
brews
out
of
sammy
smiths
dwarf
what
this
beer
presents
overall
a
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
brew
a
good
break
from
the
super
hopped
up
american
pale
ales
just
what
i
would
expect
from
the
brits
balance
and
modesty
a
most
enjoyable
beer
nicely
balanced
with
a
lowkey
complexity
this
to
me
is
the
benchmark
for
pale
ales
in
my
young
beer
tasting
career
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
great
fruity
flavour
and
plenty
of
hops
on
top
of
a
strong
malt
base
everything
was
wellbalanced
and
worked
well
together
giving
a
lingering
sweet
hoppy
taste
drinkability
a
good
beer
ine
english
style
pale
ale
nice
pale
ale
to
enjoy
the
malt
side
of
the
ale
without
having
to
fight
through
the
bitterness
of
american
pale
ales
one
more
note
i
noticed
the
pictureon
the
site
has
the
words
on
the
label
with
a
black
background
and
the
bottle
i
have
has
a
blue
background
i
remember
it
always
being
black
wonder
if
i
have
something
different
or
did
they
change
the
color
o
not
too
familiar
with
a
lot
of
english
style
ales
except
for
brown
ales
and
stouts
but
as
far
as
a
pale
ale
goes
it
has
a
nice
twist
to
what
im
used
to
drinking
not
quite
6
pack
worthy
but
good
for
an
english
style
bomber
great
beer
good
example
of
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
copperr
with
a
biege
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
bready
malt
and
some
mild
floral
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
and
bready
there
are
some
mild
hops
on
the
back
end
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
the
body
is
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
and
certainly
the
best
english
pale
ale
ive
tried
this
beer
is
known
as
the
brewerys
flagship
beer
when
you
pour
it
in
a
glass
its
a
copper
coloured
beer
the
head
and
big
and
fluffy
when
you
gulp
it
the
beer
will
tease
your
palate
and
you
will
get
the
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
even
a
hint
of
apple
it
has
great
flavours
and
aromatics
a
nice
drink
for
the
holiday
season
o
samuel
smith
does
not
make
a
bad
beer
period
im
convinced
chalk
this
one
up
as
another
english
great
and
add
one
more
brew
to
my
mustfindoncask
list
one
of
the
best
english
pale
ales
ive
tried
it
makes
me
want
to
travel
back
over
to
england
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
the
bottle
says
brewed
with
hard
well
water
the
original
well
sunk
in
1758
is
still
in
use
best
barley
malt
yeast
and
aromatic
hops
to
create
a
coppercoloured
ale
with
a
full
rounded
flavor
fermented
in
stone
yorkshire
squares
the
finish
is
a
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
a
good
many
british
beers
were
very
dark
before
the
industrial
revolution
new
malting
techniques
led
to
pale
malts
allowing
the
evolution
of
this
classic
brewing
style
a
cornerstone
of
british
pub
culture
the
palate
opens
rather
full
moderately
mineralrich
more
cationic
flavors
and
with
a
nice
balance
between
toffee
caramel
and
a
mildly
earthy
hop
flavor
bitterness
is
mild
perfectly
complementing
the
toffee
flavors
a
touch
of
butterscotch
is
present
as
well
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
toffee
hoppy
bitterness
a
little
butterscotch
and
minerals
the
bitterness
and
minerals
in
particular
make
this
stand
apart
from
other
beers
of
the
style
that
ive
had
very
good
stuff
highly
recommended
what
a
great
beer
simple
refreshing
and
surprisingly
full
of
complex
flavors
another
victory
for
samuel
smith
o
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
a
surprisingly
drinkable
pale
ale
quite
complex
and
uniquely
different
than
an
american
style
pale
ale
i
will
be
sipping
this
again
pouted
into
a
pint
glass
the
first
thing
that
stands
out
with
this
pale
ale
is
its
bright
orange
appearance
a
quick
whiff
reveals
a
wonderful
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
at
first
and
bitter
at
the
back
end
an
exhale
after
swallowing
reveals
a
nice
caramel
note
i
enjoyed
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
with
spicy
indian
foodpaired
extremely
well
o
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
just
dont
expect
it
to
be
nearly
as
hoppy
as
an
american
pale
interesting
pale
but
not
earthshattering
o
a
solid
english
pale
ale
drinkable
and
tasty
o
i
really
love
flavorful
english
pale
and
this
is
a
fine
example
sometimes
i
prefer
it
to
the
american
variant
as
they
tend
to
be
more
on
the
side
of
ipa
thats
toned
down
a
bit
but
this
beer
with
its
distinctive
english
flavors
really
is
enjoyable
and
i
will
have
again
and
again
o
impressive
pale
ale
lots
of
complex
interesting
flavor
and
aromas
would
definitely
grab
this
again
finishes
clean
and
dry
has
a
nice
and
creamy
mouth
feel
this
is
truly
a
very
drinkable
english
pale
ale
o
wow
such
a
clean
tasty
complex
beer
a
true
session
beer
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
this
straight
through
dinner
and
into
dessert
the
samuel
smiths
india
pale
ale
is
next
for
tonight
and
i
couldnt
be
more
excited
o
this
is
a
well
made
english
pale
ale
very
enjoyable
and
much
different
than
an
american
pale
ale
o
a
very
fine
perfectly
balanced
ale
that
manages
to
feel
highly
satisfying
despite
not
having
loads
of
flavours
or
high
compexity
highly
drinkable
and
even
decently
refreshing
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
small
white
lasting
beige
with
good
retention
aroma
and
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
some
citrus
and
fruity
notes
some
yeast
and
bread
with
some
light
piney
hops
a
medium
body
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
good
sweet
caramel
malt
character
some
yeast
followed
by
some
fruity
citrus
notes
ending
with
some
good
bitter
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
overall
a
good
balanced
session
brew
overall
i
continuously
read
and
hear
that
england
knows
how
to
pay
attention
to
balance
and
this
beer
is
living
proof
cant
wait
to
enjoy
another
overall
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
just
a
fantastic
pale
ale
complex
layers
of
flavour
and
just
a
great
beer
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
very
good
loads
of
flavor
for
this
english
pale
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
there
is
a
sort
of
musty
feel
about
it
that
i
find
in
all
of
samuel
smiths
beers
but
im
not
saying
thats
a
bad
quality
i
like
it
and
i
think
this
beer
falls
in
line
with
all
of
their
other
wonderful
brews
final
thoughts
i
find
myself
finding
the
english
and
scottish
styles
far
better
suited
to
my
pallet
then
their
american
counterparts
i
think
this
unseats
stambroise
as
my
pale
ale
of
choice
i
think
the
best
part
is
that
they
kept
bitterness
in
check
and
didnt
aim
closer
to
ipa
territory
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
despite
loving
samuel
smiths
i
have
steered
clear
of
this
one
for
years
because
the
nut
brown
and
the
oatmeal
and
the
imperial
were
always
sitting
right
next
to
it
and
because
im
not
a
pale
ale
or
ipa
guy
in
general
but
this
is
great
what
a
nice
and
drinkable
pairing
of
honey
malty
sweet
and
mild
hop
bitter
in
a
light
and
refreshing
package
if
i
could
ask
for
anything
it
might
be
a
bit
more
robustness
on
the
back
end
to
increase
the
richness
and
to
slow
me
down
a
bit
but
on
the
whole
its
a
very
pleasant
sessionable
wellmade
and
pleasingly
flavored
beer
o
ive
always
really
liked
this
beer
and
my
opinion
has
not
changed
in
the
slightest
over
the
years
few
english
pale
ales
or
at
least
few
that
ive
tried
are
as
flavorful
as
samuel
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
this
is
an
exquisite
ale
if
your
familiarity
with
english
pales
stops
at
whitbread
andor
bass
then
this
beer
should
be
a
must
try
for
you
d
if
american
craft
beers
are
renowned
for
being
innovative
the
brits
are
known
for
doing
the
same
exact
thing
fairly
well
for
generations
this
is
most
certainly
a
british
beer
could
easily
see
throwing
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
pub
d
ok
but
nothing
special
overall
a
textbook
english
pale
a
definitive
version
of
the
style
malty
and
delicious
this
was
a
very
nice
pale
ale
the
color
and
the
smell
were
fine
but
the
taste
was
very
traditional
barley
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
are
what
make
this
ale
so
good
first
there
is
the
malt
smell
then
the
tasted
of
malt
which
trails
off
into
the
mild
hop
crispness
i
liked
this
ale
very
much
and
recommend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
english
traditional
ales
anyway
going
off
the
bottle
i
had
id
say
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
compare
well
to
the
fullers
london
pride
i
had
earlier
in
the
evening
well
done
give
it
a
go
this
is
a
well
balanced
malty
delicious
example
of
the
style
ive
had
it
on
several
occasions
and
ive
enjoyed
it
every
time
notes
killer
this
beer
instantly
joins
the
pantheon
i
allow
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
to
pass
through
the
gates
unmolested
as
the
overall
composition
of
this
masterpiece
works
in
every
way
o
i
was
a
bit
dissappointed
by
the
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
a
bit
too
mild
overall
very
drinkable
though
and
very
smooth
i
like
the
flavor
this
is
an
ale
for
all
times
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
overall
a
very
fine
english
pale
ale
very
malty
but
the
sweetness
is
nice
and
not
too
much

some

but
im
thrown
off
by
this

it
doesnt

but
just
a
bad
mix
of
malts
i
drank
the
whole

wont
be

this

thanks
sam
overall
i
enjoyed
this
it
may
have
been
my
first
english
pale
ale
and
is
not
comparable
to
american
pale
ales
i
little
heavier
because
of
the
sweetness
and
not
as
hoppy
bitter
tmo
dry
carmel
malts
upfront
sweet
candy
type
flavor
ive
read
prior
to
this
review
of
other
saying
flavors
of
jolly
rancher
grape
flavor
comes
to
mind
or
maybe
a
hint
of
watermelon
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
i
really
like
the
dry
bite
to
this
brew
flavor
is
there
with
a
strong
complex
presence
and
then
dissipates
quickly
very
good
stuff
although
one
or
two
of
these
is
plenty
for
my
tastes
to
strong
in
the
carmel
maltiness
of
it
i
could
see
getting
fatigued
with
that
overall
its
a
good
beer
o
a
very
very
fine
representation
of
the
style
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
like
all
samuel
smiths
beers
this
is
afire
fine
beer
recommended
overallsimple
and
straight
to
the
point
like
all
sam
smith
beers
its
very
drinkable
this
550
will
be
finished
shortly
really
good
and
highly
drinkable
maybe
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
maybe
but
really
good
i
could
sit
and
drink
a
pile
of
these
notes
the
nut
brown
was
quite
nice
the
imperial
stout
was
amazing
and
this
beer
falls
somewhere
between
those
two
ive
still
got
two
more
bottles
of
sam
smiths
to
try
before
i
pick
my
favorite
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
i
think
i
have
a
new
champion
o
easily
one
of
my
favorite
epas
a
beer
i
could
easily
have
3
or
4
of
in
a
night
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
as
its
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
mine
is
a
heavy
brown
bottle
vice
the
clear
one
in
the
picture
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
was
highly
malty
underlain
with
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
with
tastes
of
honey
and
raspberries
on
the
tongue
great
goshdarn
how
have
i
overlooked
this
beer
for
so
long
finish
was
very
fruity
with
a
little
butteriness
to
boot
how
do
they
do
that
i
gotta
make
a
mental
note
of
this
one
allinall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
too
mild
on
the
bitterness
for
a
english
pale
ale
sb
with
that
said
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
drink
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
british
pale
ale
lots
of
malt
easy
to
drink
and
very
flavorful
d
eh
good
but
not
great
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
epas
but
i
cant
really
get
stoked
on
this
one
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
overall
good
beverage
trhat
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
wish
i
could
give
this
one
a
higher
score
but
the
nose
was
just
offputting
too
bad
a
twist
on
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
pale
this
being
my
first
epa
i
was
sadly
surprised
at
the
lack
of
a
hop
character
the
flavor
profile
was
excellent
but
lacked
in
that
citric
bite
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
probably
not
purchase
again
good
brew
samuel
smith
old
brewery
overall
somewhat
interesting
in
taste
and
even
still
good
tasting
in
general
worth
a
try
serving
type
bottle
this
pale
ale
pours
out
slightly
darker
than
most
of
the
typical
pale
ales
out
there
today
this
look
more
like
an
ipa
with
its
really
nice
copper
color
the
head
is
white
and
doesnt
have
the
best
retention
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
had
a
strong
backbone
of
malts
coming
from
it
the
flavor
is
a
little
hoppy
but
its
more
grainy
than
anything
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
good
carbonation
and
drinkable
on
mostly
all
aspects
overall
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
but
guessing
the
single
bottle
i
picked
up
at
trader
joes
isnt
exactly
brewery
fresh
put
an
asterisk
on
this
review
given
the
reputation
of
the
brewery
im
sure
a
quality
sample
of
the
beer
is
significantly
better
o
a
very
sesionable
ale
with
plenty
on
offer
when
this
is
fresh
and
wellkept
sophisticated
transcendent
satisfying
as
hell
overall
the
beer
is
good
but
doesnt
offer
anything
new
or
special
to
the
pale
ales
solid
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
starter
beer
or
if
you
enjoy
bitter
beers
i
could
live
without
this
one
imo
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
solid
all
around
could
be
enjoyed
year
round
also
i
thought
it
might
be
a
bit
fuller
but
thats
ok
it
is
what
it
is
i
mean
its
sam
smiths
how
bad
could
it
be
its
still
head
and
shoulders
above
any
macro
picked
this
up
at
the

with
hints
of
caramel

perfume
and
a
touch
of
metal
the
taste
follows
suit
earthy
fruity
and
nutty
with
a
nice
tangy
herbal
fresh
hop
bite
a
solid
toffee
malty
base
balances
it
out
nicely
with
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
a
touch
of
molasses
a
little
fizzy
at
first
but
smoothed
out
nicely
becoming
very
drinkable
as
it
warmed
great
balance
with
a
nice
slightly
dry
tangy
bitter
finish
another
great
beer
from
samuel
smiths
i
dont
often
purchase
this
product
when
i
visit
the
local
beer
store
perhaps
it
is
the
price
and
no
freshness
date
i
was
delighted
with
the
freshness
of
this
bottle
this
is
a
complex
but
quaffable
ale
for
any
season
overall
i
was
pleased
with
this
brew
not
as
much
as
other
samuel
smiths
brews
but
i
would
definitely
have
another
the
beer
goes
down
well
enough
but
the
apple
juicecider
qualities
are
a
limiting
factor
for
me
they
are
a
but
too
strong
for
my
tastes
drinkability
is
high
i
could
drink
pint
after

this
excellent

quite
an

the
color
when
poured
was
a
dark
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
very
little

fair

on
the
glass
the
taste
was
of
mild
roasted
malts
with
a
lack
luster
hoppy
flavor
weak
on
the
aftertaste
but
a
bit
to
bitter
overall
not
a
big
smell
weak
flavor
and
a
little
to
bitter
d
a

that
id
only
choose
if
the
only
other
choices
were

the

of

in
the
taste
medium

with
a
dry
feel
and
a
toasted
feeling
in

aftertaste
a
decent

one
i
imagine
would
be
even
better
off

russet

with
a
12

fades
to
a
tight

on
top
lots
of
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
with
some
herbal
and
grassy

aromas
its
the
simple
complexity
that
makes
this
beer
so
delicious
caramal
malts
sweet
breads
just
enough
grassy
and
herbal
hops
incredibly
balanced
incredibly
simple
incredibly
delicious
this
is
the
standard
to
which
i
hold
all
english
pale
ales
very
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
toasty
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
d
well
i
like
it
and
its
hard
to
believe
its
an
english
pale
ale
since
most
offend
me
with
herb
notes
this
one
is
sweet
yet
bitter
and
kind
of
a
dry
finish
not
something
i
would
hunt
for
but
i
would
pick
it
up
at
the
same
price
o
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
like
the
earthiness
of
this
one
aroma
is
especially
pleasant
hits
the
spot
some
days
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
made
me
fall
in
love
with
beer
in
general
and
i
still
havent
gotten
tired
of
it
though
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tried
it
might
just
be
the
best
in
its
category
the
organic
version
is
great
too
anyways
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
you
might
not
love
it
but
i
bet
youll
appreciate
it
overall
a
good
balanced
drinkable
pale
ale
this
beer
does
not
have
all
the
qualities
i
was
hoping
to
taste
however
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
pour
resulted
in
a
two
finger
head
of
light
brown
thick
suds
great
clinging
lace
with
nice
pattern
the
color
is
a
20
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
haziness
smells
of
sour
dough
bread
caramel
and
some
earthly
tones
flavorful
with
hints
of
bread
caramel
molasses
sweet
malt
and
hops
full
body
of
creaminess
in
my
mouth
good
tight
flavor
with
lots
of
character
will
have
more
of
this
in
the
future
overall
this
is
another
great
offering
from
samuel
smiths
i
was
genuinely
impressed
as
i
was
not
expecting
that
much
from
it
truly
english
truly
ale
recommended
drinkability
the
aftertaste
hangs
around
for
a
bit
too
long
but
besides
that
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
have
always
been
a
big
fan
of
samuel
smith
beers
unfortunately
the
old
brewery
pale
ale
did
not
work
for
me
there
was
an
undescribable
flavortaste
to
this
particular
s
s
that
i
just
did
not
care
for
i
plan
to
stick
with
many
of
the
other
beers
from
their
line
would
certainly
drink
again
though
might
not
choose
over
other
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
is
ok
good
price
good
taste
its
just
the
mouthfeel
that
kills
it
a
little
d
quite
drinkable
but
not
my
overall
style
drinkability
an
excellent
exemplar
of
the
english
pale
ale
style
definitely
something
lovers
of
the
style
should
try
and
something
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
again
poured
a
2
head
which
dissipates
to
18
surprisingly
dark
for
a
pale
ale
looks
like
lipton
tea
in
fact
both
in
bottle
and
in
glass
my
sample
looks
surprisingly
dark
compared
to
the
photo
in
the
ba
reviews
has
a
nice
creaminess
some
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
honestly
to
me
this
seems
like
an
aborted
stout
like
they
started
to
make
multiple
things
out
of
their
stout
process
and
with
more
time
or
a
little
tweaking
this
pale
ale
would
indeed
have
been
a
stout
enjoyable
but
not
what
i
expect
from
a
pale
ale
the
price
was
reasonable
but
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
so
i
guess
it
is
not
worth
it
the
pale
ale
unfortunately
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
evening
but
it
paired
well
with
the
roast
beef
horseradish
mashed
potatoes
and
yorkshire
pudding
we
enjoyed
with
it
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
flavorforward
and
expressive
while
discussing
this
with
samuel
we
talked
about
american
pale
ales
and
he
mentioned
he
enjoyed
a
few
in
seattle
the
previous
evening
and
said
they
were
fantastic
but
certainly
too
hoppy
for
a
session
drink
up
chaps
overall
this
is
big
on
flavour
without
any
particular
one
standing
out
nicely
drinkable
and
what
i
imagine
a
proper
epa
to
be
could
see
sessioning
a
few
rounds
of
this
in
a
dim
pub
arguing
the
various
inconsequential
merits
of
champions
or
premier
league
play
danother
fine
beer
from
samuel
smiths
not
my
favorite
beer
in
their
fine
lineup
due
to
style
but
they
are
among
the
best
at
getting
so
much
flavor
and
other
characteristics
in
a
5
abv
beer
d
if
one
can
handle
a
heavy
beer
by
just
by
sipping
and
savoring
this
beer
is
for
you
d
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
goes
down
smooth
but
leave
a
nice
little
complex
hoppy
taste
behind
i
cant
really
pinpoint
any
exact
flavors
in
here
but
it
sure
is
good
i
could
defiantly
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
not
get
tired
of
it
i
would
say
this
pale
ale
is
a
step
above
most
pale
ales
drinkability
with
its
fairly
mild
flavor
and
smoothness
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
notes
well
done
another
sam
smith
classic
drinkability
went
well
with
a
meal
pork
chops
and
homemade
ginger
gold
applesauce
and
i
suspect
it
would
be
good
on
its
own
but
ill
admit
to
getting
bored
with
this
beer
by
the
end
its
a
single
flavor
profile
beer
it
showcases
malts
and
thats
about
it
it
is
however
a
good
example
of
a
british
beer
and
maybe
i
needed
something
less
sweet
in
the
meal
to
go
with
it
and
then
i
would
have
appreciated
it
more
drinkability
really
good
beer
the
taste
is
quite
complex
yet
contains
nothing
too
overbearing
simple
smooth
and
good
a
very
solid
drinkable
beer
all
in
all
a
good
beer
i
think
it
is
a
great
execution
of
the
style
seems
very
traditional
it
did
not
let
me
down
in
the
age
of
super
hoppy
beers
a
refreshing
more
malty
change
all
in
balance
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
where
it
formed
a
thick
white
head
the
liquid
turned
to
a
dark
orangish
brown
color
the
smell
was
not
strong
but
on
first
sip
you
could
taste
the
flavor
of
the
beer
there
was
no
strong
after
taste
and
it
went
down
clean
as
you
continued
to
drink
you
could
continue
to
see
the
remains
of
the
head
sticking
to
the
side
of
the

pretty

forward
english
ale
had
a
nice
medium
body
to
it
very
smooth
very
drinkable
too
i
polished
the
bottle
off
easily
and
could
have
kept
drinking
more
i
could
see
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
pub
went
will
with
some
grilled
catfish
and
corn
i
imagine
its
a
pretty
good
allaround
food
beer
not
flashy
but
a
solid
and
delicious
beer
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
slightly
sweet
malts
and
floral
hop
flavoring
and
bitterness
malts
are
toasty
and
caramely
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
on
this
one
very
creamy
feeling
and
perfectly
carbonated
probably
the
most
refreshing
british
pale
ale
i
have
had
thus
far
minerality
comes
through
chalky
even
fruit
is
kept
surprisingly
mild
for
an
epa
i
really
like
it
and
cannot
believe
it
took
12
years
of
craft
beer
drinking
to
finally
try
it
pretty
drinkable
overall
i
actually
like
this
a
lot
better
than
fullers
but
i
know
i
am
crazy
to
say
this
but
i
like
the
much
lighter
colored
sam
adams
pale
ale
better
than
both
much
better
drinkablity
samuel
smith
is
always
great
for
full
flavored
beers
you
can
really
taste
this
from
the
front
to
the
back
of
the
mouth
nice
soft
feel
but
enough
dryness
to
leave
a
lasting
finish
this
is
a
classic
pale
ale
it
is
light
enough
to
drink
as
a
session
yet
the
flavor
is
powerful
and
lasting
this
ranks
very
highly
in
my
opinion
decent
beer
not
somthing
id
seek
out
although
id
really
like
to
taste
this
fresh
i
think
it
would
be
a
completely
different
beer
excellent
mouthfeel
a
mediumfull
body
and
modest
carbonation
render
quite
a
smooth
texture
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
as
it
falls
short
in
the
flavor
department
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
nor
my
favorite
brew
from
mr
smith
copper
colored
this
beer
has
a
light
haze
to
the
body
with
an
ample
bonecolored
head
atop
stonefruit
and
butter
toffee
permeate
the
nose
the
fruit
being
especially
prominent
lightly
sweet
and
lightly
tart
it
has
a
bit
of
graininess
to
it
as
well
pale
and
amber
malts
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
rearranged
the
biscuitlike
malts
are
foreward
with
a
mild
jamlike
fruitiness
behind
its
like
taking
a
bite
of
toast
covered
in
peach
preserves
and
butter
hearty
but
light
this
has
a
lot
of
depth
yet
its
very
quaffable
and
balanced
it
ends
on
a
malty
and
mildly
buttery
and
fruity
note
with
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
ultimately
drying
and
crackery
very
good
this
is
a
clear
and
brassy
brew
which
sports
a
prolific
and
stubborn
bubbly
tan
head
lace
is
thin
and
spotty
where
it
exists
smells
of
caramel
malts
some
light
fruits
grain
some
faint
hops
and
tannins
really
complex
for
the
style
tastes
of
sweet
malts
more
light
fruits
faint
cinnamon
and
tea
leaves
a
slight
nuttiness
comes
out
later
on
goes
down
smooth
and
almost
creamy
highly
drinkable
yet
interesting
makes
for
a
great
combo
poured
from
a
brown

7

a

with
a
12
inch

smell
is

hops
maybe
a

taste
is
also
nutty
balanced
hops
and
malts
some
honey
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
drinkability
i
can
really
enjoy
one
of
these
but
alas
i
find
myself
wanting
something
else
after
that
i
seem
to
recall
enjoying
this
much
more
a
couple
of
years
ago
to
the
point
of
its
being
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
but
now
i
think
its
just
pretty
good
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
it
i
dont
think
most
people
would
regret
getting
a
fourpack
also
interesting
for
being
a
maltier
kind
of
pale
ale
than
many
ive
had
a
medium
light
body
with
relatively
low
carbonation
this
one
is
very
quaffable
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
body
is
mild
with
a
silkysmooth
texture
and
a
clean
finish
making
it
very
drinkable
d
very
tasty
another
great
offering
from
samuel
smith
drinkability
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
consumed
a
true
english
pale
ale
the
style
pretty
much
having
been
abandoned
by
american
craft
brewers
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
even
though
the
style
is
not
one
i
would
reach
for
every
day
good
session
beer
drinkability
quite
drinkable
indeed
im
going
to
go
enjoy
the
rest
of
this
out
on
the
patio
notes
i
really
like
this
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
very
traditionally
british
but
will
please
almost
anyone
o
good
drinkability
quite
light
and
refreshing
beer
but
at
the
same
time
with
strong
british
personality
an
authentic
british
ale
light
in
alcohol
balanced
bitterness
dry
taste
good
perfume
of
earthy
yeasts
and
fresh
hops
recommended
beer
is
oddly
bitter
highly
drinkable
medium
to
full
body
overall
its
really
smooth
and
there
is
almost
a
red
like
flavor
sweetness
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
overall
its
pretty
good
this
just
has
such
a
nice
combination
of
complex
but
mild
flavors
that
its
hard
to
stop
quaffing
d
a
very
solid
english
pale
ale
that
is
slightly
light
on
bitterness
and
high
on
fruitiness
as
is
common
in
the
style
poured
into
my
favorite
beer
glass
toasted
english
malt
fills
the
aroma
it
has
a
full
white
head
and
a
almost
cloudy
amber
color
the
flavor
starts
sweet
with
a
slight
amount
of
carbonation
but
finished
dry
but
a
slightly
nutty
aftertaste
a
very
good
english
and
i
like
its
complexity
despite
the
lack
of
hops
that
ive
come
to
like
in
an
american
style
d
highly
drinkable
added
to
my
short
list
of
session
standbys
ill
pick
this
up
whenever
its

a
little
earthy

minimal
hop
presence
tastes
mild
and

easygoing
smooth

approaches

very

make
this

session
beer
drinkablity
an
english
pale
ale
done
properly
this
beer
amazes
me
it
has
all
the
strong
complex
malt
and
fruity
esters
of
an
english
barley
wine
yet
remains
with
a
modest
alcohol
content
its
not
as
warming
alcohol
wise
of
course
but
all
the
flavor
is
there
if
you
really
want
a
sessionable
ale
that
is
complex
and
extremely
flavorful
this
your
beer
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
american
pale
ales
with
a
strong
malt
taste
and
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
this
beer
however
is
changing
my
mind
a
bit
instead
of
floral
flavors
this
is
packed
full
of
malt
and
fruit
a
total
english
classic
and
world
class
pale
ale
d
a
classic
pale
ale
from
sam
smiths
a
great
beer
that
will
tell
you
what
english
pale
alesbitters
are
about
great
complexity
and
nuance
slainte
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
big
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
entirely
of
toasted
malt
with
some
wet
earth
also
detectable
the
taste
is
simple
not
very
catchy
the
toasted
malts
are
supported
by
a
mineral
and
black
tea
bitterness
that
is
good
but
not
eyebrow
raising
given
how
expensive
it
is
i
expected
more
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
major
samuel
smith
beers
the
feel
and
bodyy
was
a
little
on
the
light
side
the
carbonation
was
very
sharp
initially
and
kept
my
cheeks
puckered
through
the
finish
this
ones
not
bad
but
not
the
brewerys
best
beer
2
from
the
sampler
pack
the
pale
ale
is
a
solid
english
pale
very
balanced
between
malt
and
bitterness
id
like
to
try
this
on
cask
sometime
overall
this
reaffirms
my
conclusion
that
i
prefer
the
american
hop
strains
versus
those
out
of
the
uk
but
this
is
certainly
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
the
first
beer
thats
impressed
me
out
of
samuel
smiths
stable
d
its
not
my
favorite
samuel
smith
beer
but
it
might
be
the
most
drinkable
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
drinkability
very
nice
in
the
sense
that
it
dries
nicely
towards
the
end
and
leaves
your

needs
to
be
judged
on

scale

this
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
its
a

blah

not

also

poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
impressive
head
however
it
dwindled
quickly
leaving
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
malt
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
maple
or
molasses
the
smell
was
also
a
bit
skunky
just
too
mild
and
pale
for
my
taste
the
poured
appearance
is
richly
golden
with

hey
i
said
it
looked
good
with
a
thick
shortlived
head
aroma
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
on
the
malty
side
not
citrusy
such
as
i
expect
with
a
pale
ale
the
taste
was
very
budweiseresque
or
warm

overly
sweet

with

may

personal
notes
i

was

if

is

i
imagine

out
of

the
brewers
other
products
but
it
must
be
the
clear
bottle
that
has
sapped
all
the
character
from
this
beer
i
cant
believe
i
will
bother
much
more
with
these
brews
why
would
i
spend
big
money
on
them
when
their
character
is
sapped
by
the
brewer
putting
them
in
clear

this
is
simply
a
waste
of
craftsmanship
i
still
have
to
say
my
favorite

the
nose
displays
an
earthy
malt
and
lightly
grassy
hops
as
well
as
an
affirmative
diacetyl
butterscotch
note
the
body
is
medium
light
and
combines
with
a
very
fine
gentle
carbonation
to
create
a
nicely
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
mainly
of
a
lightly
caramel
biscuity
malt
thats
enhanced
by
a
touch
of
buttery
diacetyl
a
distinct
earthiness
some
mild
fruitiness
a
light
hop
flavor
and
a
firm
balancing
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
hoppiness
combines
with
the
sweet
buttery
malt
to
give
a
light
spiciness
on
the
tongue
and
throat
similar
to
that
of
black
licorice

i
certainly
didnt

many
with
the

abundance
of
flavour
while
i
dearly
love
the
crazy
hoppy
pale
ales
we
produce
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
there
really
is
something
to
be
said
for
a
more
subtle
complex
ale
like
this
one
it
reaches
orvallike
heights
of
elusiveness
of
flavour
and
impressions
two
beers
that
are
hard
to
pinpoint
because
you
always
notice
something
different
when
drinking
them
but
both
beers

do
without

does

the
beers

the

malty
grain
sweetness
is
almost
one
with
the
slight
spicy
hop
character
very
traditional
feel
nice
and
refreshing
just
an
allaround
pleasure
to
drink
good
session
brew
too
a
craft
beer
classic
my
bottle
was
slightly
skunked
they
love
those
clear
bottles
at
sam
smithsbut
even
that
aside
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
at
the
quality
given
how
much
i
love
their
oatmeal
and
imperial
stouts
the
aroma
was
malty
and
had
a
stale
aspect
to
it
the
flavor
was
lacking
in
hops
but
still
managed
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
all
in
all
i
expected
better
pours
a
clear
but
dark
caramel
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
that
leaves
a
lace
all
the
way
down
the
appearance
is
beautiful
the
smell
is
slightly
fruity
and
lightly
hoppy
the
taste
is
consistant
with
the
smell
but
also
reveals
a
malty
taste
and
mouthfeel
it
surprisingly
doesnt
finish
as
dryhoppy
as
some
other
pale
ales
that
ive
tried
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
but
wasnt
too
disappointed
either
cheers
this
is
beer
i
last
had
on
tap
in
lincoln
england
in
a
bottle
here
it
poured
a
nice
amber
color
and
formed
an
off
white
head
with
some
nice
lace
the
aroma
was
of
hops
and
some
fruitnoncitrus
the
flavor
sweet
and
of
hops
malt
and
caramel
finish
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
usually
expect
in
pale
ales
a
good
beer
but
definately
over
here
in
the
states
in
a
bottle
a
different
brew
clear
and
amber
spicy
aroma
and
14
inch
pillowy
head
hops
in
the
flavor
are
restrained
malts
are
more
niticeable
and
a
little
like
pumpkin
pie
filling
not
a
lot
of
finish
despite
a
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
but
there
is
little
fade
in
the
mouth
pretty
good
balance
in
the
hopmalt
arena
but
then
again
sam
knows
what
theyre
doing
i
tend
to
prefer
american
pales
but
would
love
to
try
this
stuff
on
tap
overall
an
everymans
beer
or
it
should
be
instead
of
commercial
swill
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
not
very
assertive
as
it
mellows
with
any
food
this
beer
has
a
creamy
texture
for
a
pale
ale
but
with
enough
bite
to
keep
it
going
round
and
balanced
mouthfeel
high
acidity
medium
to
high
bitterness
shows
great
balance
the
toffee
orangey
toasty
taste
make
this
another
of
the
old
tadcaster
brewerey
must
dos
very
well
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
dry
hoppy
finish
not
my
favourite
but
i
got
a
feeling
that
the
place
that
served
it
hadnt
cleaned
there
equipment
for
a
while
coz
it
tasted
off
so
thats
what
my
ratings
based
on
copper
in
color
and
very
clear
moderate
but
persistent
head
unfortunately
this
bottle
was
a
tad
skunked
you
might
get
lucky
and
get
a
better
bottle
what
would
be
a
leafy
and
earthy
fuggles
hop
nose
has
become
masked
by
skunky
mercaptans
the
skunkiness
does
dissapate
as
the
beer
breathes
and
thankfully
signature
fruity
british
yeast
esters
and
a
butterscotch
note
assert
themselves
luckily
the
skunkiness
didnt
make
its
way
into
the
flavor
the
moderate
hop
bitterness
is
quite
clean
and
adequately
balances
sweetness
from
crystal
malt
and
residual
sugars
left
by
the
yeast
pleasant
mild
diacetyl
rounds
out
the
flavor
this
pale
finishes
w
dry
biscuit
malt
notes
the
skunkiness
prevented
this
from
reaching
its
potential
my
suggestion
is
to
pour
the
entire
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
and
let
it
breathe
for
several
minutes
before
tasting
theres
not
much
head
to
this
beer
at
all
although
ive
come
to
not
expect
much
in
the
head
department
from
samuel
smith
what
it
lacks
in
head
it
makes
up
partly
in
coloration
with
its
nice
medium
brown
transparent
color
it
feels
really
smooth
on
the
tongue
which
is
nice
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
and
malty
and
then
you
notice
a
bit
of
roastiness
the
bitterness
is
very
mild
im
not
overly
big
on
pale
ales
but
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
notes
clean
to
the
tongue
with
lots
of
complexity
perfect
quaffing
material
a
pale
ale
to
reckon
with
somewhat
on
the
tart
side
seemed
to
be
a
little
more
flavorful
as
it
warmed
an
excellent
and
accessible
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
lighter
in
color
and
a
bit
more
subtle
than
their
organic
pale
ale
flavor
initial
flavor
is
the
sweet
barley
malt
toffee
caramel
and
white
bread
the
middle
has
some
butterscotch
and
fruity
esters
with
a
earthy
hop
bite
in
the
finish
o
extremely
well
balanced
with
the
malt
and
hops
working
very
well
together
nice
and
easy
to
drink
to
boot
definitely
recommended
for
fans
of
english
ales
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
highly
carbonated
massive
white
head
this
beer
is
perfect
to
me
like
nothing
i
have
ever
tasted
before
a
truly
unique
brew
that
is
incredibly
balanced
and
still
complex
and
interesting
to
taste
my
expierence
in
pale
ales
has
been
sierra
nevadawest
coast
type
stuff
and
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
the
brews
that
come
out
of
the
west
coast
but
this
is
just
so
different
yet
still
so
enjoyable
to
sip
on
go
buy
one
cost
me
3
50
at
pw
mart
in
poway
ca
a
decent
price
for
a
really
outstanding
beer
this
is
definitely
not
an
american
beer
by
any
standard
not
to
say
american
beers
arent
balanced
but
this
is
the
best
balanced
beer
ive
ever
had
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
a
pretty
decent
beer
seems
sort
of
like
a
slightly
watered
down
version
of
their
porter
or
something
like
that
very
tasty
english
pale
ale
not
in
your
face
in
any
respect
i
gravitated
to
the
mineral
and
yeasty
body
this
is
a
wellexecuted
ale
worth
a
try
as
it
does
good
service
to
this
style

samuel
smith
is
in
my
mind
as
much
a
british
emblem
as
the
crown
jewels
or
buckingham
palace
there
may
be
no
beer
that
better
blends
englands
proud
brewing
traditions
with
its
modern
environmental
and
gastronomic
values
than
organic
pale
ale
or
as
its
also
perhaps
more
aptly
known
organic
best
ale
i
wish
more
flagship
offerings
were
this
good
final
grade
4
22
a
very
respectable
a
samuel
smiths
organic
pale
ale
is
an
immaculately
balanced
ale
that
is
guaranteed
to
please
any
fan
of
english
pales
while
the
malts
are
probably
more
likely
to
draw
the
bulk
of
your
taste
buds
attention
the
earthy
bitterness
provided
by
the
english
hops
is
a
perfect
counterweight
to
their
biscuity
toasted
sweetness
this
is
one
of
the
best
epas
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
although
at
this
price
point
3
85
per
bottle
its
not
exactly
the
cheapest
tipple
as
far
as
this
style
goes
well
worth
a
try
for
any
english
ale
fan
poured
a
gorgeous
amber
with
a
half
finger
off
white
head
a
nice
look
that
reminds
one
of
an
english
classic
scents
of
caramel
honey
sweet
malt
and
slight
apple
juice
not
amazing
but
it
entices
one
to
taste
flavors
of
grainy
malt
slight
caramel
and
honey
sweetness
particularly
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
though
both
are
extremely
muted
and
a
nice
moderate
level
of
bitterness
with
some
floral
hop
flavors
finish
is
slightly
dry
very
well
done
subdued
yet
with
a
hoppy
character
not
greatly
hoppy
like
an
apa
it
balances
its
bitterness
with
a
nice
grainy
malt
back
bone
and
a
very
slight
sweetness
to
make
it
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
perfect
for
a
session
ale
a
classic
english
pub
style
executed
extremely
well
the
best
epa
ive
had
well
worth
drinking
one
of
the
worst
stuffs
from
samuel
smith
that
i
have
had
so
far
clean
ale
flavor
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
a
bit
of
citrus
flavor
and
in
the
nose
good
head
that
lasted
through
the
first
several
sips
i
poured
mine
straight
from
the
fridge
into
a
chilled
glass
was
delicious
when
very
cold
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
just
think
of
all
the
best
things
you
could
say
about
a
lager
and
this
would
be
the
one
for
me
after
drinking
4
of
these
just
now
im
completely
lost
for
words
the
pour
is
a
beautiful
clear
gold
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
fruity
and
floral
without
being
overdone
the
body
and
mouthfeel
is
just
right
full
and
not
heavy
perfect
introduction
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
drinkable
lager
or
share
with
a
lady
friend
and
the
best
part
is
this
beer
is
usda
organic
and
free
of
chemical
pesticides
overall
i
thought
this
was
fine
definitely
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
a
craving
for
it
again
just
didnt
have
enough
flavor
for
me
i
will
drink
this
from
time
to
time
several
times
a
year
not
a
champion
beer
but
awfully
good
o
very
solid
i
admit
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
this
good
seeing
as
i
dont
usually
gravitate
towards
the
style
if
it
had
a
bit
more
depth
it
would
be
incredible
as
it
stands
right
now
its
simply
very
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
white
head
developing
which
lasted
reasonably
well
and
has
descent
lacing
appearance
was
an
amber
gold
color
with
a
slight
haziness
aroma
was
of
citrus
and
grain
taste
hat
notes
of
caramel
fruity
citrus
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
with
a
light
hop
aftertaste
o
fruity
flavorful
with
a
full
mouthful
a
definite
goto
beer
for
me
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
especially
for
people
who
are
big
on
eating
and
drinking
organic
o
an
absolute
home
run
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malt
novices
and
beer
snobs
alike
should
be
able
to
enjoy
o
feels
like
a
real
standard
this
could
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
if
it
were
more
readily
available
here
in
az
its
versatile
enough
for
most
occasions
and
meal
pairings
id
like
to
have
it
on
hand
for
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
trying
standoutdifferent
beers
overall
this
beer
has
a
fabulous
nose
and
feel
the
taste
is
not
quite
up
to
the
former
two
but
is
still
rather
good
one
to
try
if
you
have
the
chance
o
this
is
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
it
is
not
overbearing
in
any
aspect
but
the
mix
of
subtle
flavours
creates
a
bold
tasting
yet
easily
sessionable
pale
highly
recommended
poured
from
a
brown
18
7
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
crisp
mild
some
malts
kind
of
on
the
mild
side
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
nothing
great
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
great
as
people
say
i
think
samuel
smith
is
very
overrated
and
just
dont
make
anything
that
i
care
for
maybe
i
am
just
not
into
english
beers
overall
good
epa
though
it
drinks
close
to
an
esb
great
allaround
balance
a
beer
just
about
anyone
can
appreciate
an
allaround
nice
maltdominant
pale
ale
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
overall
a
strange
beerlooks
like
a
pale
ale
but
tastes
and
smells
like
a
fruity
maibock
rjt
o
great
pale
ale
lovely
fruit
combined
with
caramel
and
balanced
hops
really
like
the
smell
of
it
an
exemplar
of
the
english
pale
ale
style
this
is
a
beer
where
the
hops
play
second
fiddle
to
the
yeast
with
excellent
results
ester
and
fruit
dominate
both
aroma
and
flavor
the
real
highlight
of
this
beer
though
is
its
rich
velvety
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
one
i
will
buy
again
overall
a
fantastically
well
put
together
english
ale
nice
winter
sipper
certainly
not
a
sessional
ale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
slight
caramel
and
some
light
fruity
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
light
fruits
and
some
mild
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
in
my
opinion
hayward
abbey
rating
97
a
brilliantly
made
ale
the
label
grabbed
my
attention
first
but
the
ale
itself
really
lived
up
to
it
its
well
balanced
and
with
some
really
aromatic
notes
a
very
good
session
beer
and
i
like
the
organic
factor
too
big
plus
in
my
book
pours
a
quite
clear
dark
straw
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
half
a
finger
head
there
are
many
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
i
notice
some
floral
and
earthy
hops
with
some
malt
this
is
a
very
clean
tasting
beer
it
is
light
in
body
there
is
enough
malt
character
balanced
by
the
earthy
hop
character
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
it
has
some
character
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
super
creamy
rocky
white
head
smells
of
grape
must
and
a
hint
of
freshly
baked
bread
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
lemon
squares
followed
by
some
licorice
and
finally
some
medicinal
herbal
hops
finishes
a
bit
tart
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
an
interesting
beer
though
the
taste
seems
a
little
bit
odd
o
a
great
session
beer
overall
dont
pass
this
up
it
is
quality
beer
and
very
appetizing
in
a
awkward
way
comes
off
raw
at
the
beginning
but
it
is
very
hard
to
hate
salud
o
dammit
im
going
to
england
now
i
want
beer
like
this
fresh
and
on
cask
everywhere
i
go
nothing
like
ordering
a
pint
of
bitter
and
getting
something
like
this
suck
it
america
oh
wait
o
havent
had
a
great
deal
of
english
beers
but
this
is
a
very
good
complex
yet
wellbalanced
ale
samuel
smiths
makes
great
beer
solid
appearance
aroma
and
flavor
which
goes
down
easily
really
great
beer
o
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
standard
is
for
an
english
ale
this
is
it
simple
flavorful
and
just
damn
well
done
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
you
could
almost
call
this
a
lawnmower
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
pale
ale
thats
very
easy
to
drink
i
enjoy
it
more
than
their
other
pale
ale
a
definitive
version
of
the
style
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
classic
sam
smith
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
but
clear
light
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
yeast
cereal
graininess
caramel
and
lemon
smells
good
but
nothing
special
the
taste
is
fresh
baked
bread
and
caramel
i
get
some
lemon
coming
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
sessionable
epa
it
has
a
lot
of
good
flavors
going
on
but
the
yeast
character
is
a
little
too
strong
for
my
preference
definitely
glad
i
picked
this
up
this
is
a
solid
easydrinking
beer
superb
get
some
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
feel
like
the
fruit
could
have
been
suppressed
somewhat
but
like
every
other
beer
samuel
smith
makes
this
one
is
a
winner
notes
balanced
well
made
bitter
with
appropriate
bitterness
a
good
beer
overall
certainly
not
bad
but
nothing
very
special
either
taking
into
account
that
it
is
not
cheap
i
am
not
sure
if
it
was
worth
the
money
o
a
beautifully
balanced
amazingly
layered
ale
great
flavors
and
complexity
ill
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
zraly
put
it
well
calling
this
one
no
frills
just
straight
forward
quality
organic
ale
the
ultimate
session
ale
not
only
that
but
an
ale
to
check
your
head
on
and
remember
what
it
tastes
like
to
drink
a
wellmade
nofrills
honesttogoodness
ale
excellent
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
with
not
much
going
on
in
the
glass
expected
more
from
samuel
smith
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
drinkable
clean
smooth
well
balanced
and
all
around
enjoyable
its
not
very
complex
but
for
the
style
it
has
just
enough
overall
i
am
just
loving
this
lingering
strawberry
finish
everywhere
great
great
friggin
beer
m
carbonation
gives
it
some
sting
while
it
is
lighter
in
body
crisp
and
refreshing
enjoyed
at
bohemia
in
st
petersburg
fl
which
incidentally
may
be
the
best
spot
in
this
town
for
quality
food
and
beer
this
beer
pours
a
rustic
clayamber
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
soapy
offwhite
head
which
is
not
as
hearty
as
i
was
expecting
given
the
style
the
nose
is
lightly
floral
with
hints
of
honey
and
something
like
rosewater
and
it
shows
very
little
caramel
or
butter
for
an
epa
the
flavor
shows
a
bit
more
of
the
sweet
caramelized
barley
and
offers
a
slightly
citric
hop
note
in
addition
to
the
aforementioned
floral
nuance
this
brew
scores
points
with
me
for
the
overall
skew
of
the
profile
away
from
buttery
malt
and
earthy
tealike
hop
towards
a
more
clean
lively
and
zesty
direction
the
feel
is
quite
nice
very
refreshing
and
retains
a
great
deal
of
tooth
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
as
are
most
sam
smiths
a
nice
light
and
well
balanced
ale
overall
this
is
really
boring
ale
all
around
usually
i
enjoy
the
ss
products
immensely
but
this
one
just
isnt
doing
anything
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
delicate
nose
to
the
boring
flavors
you
could
definitely
do
worse
as
the
quality
of
the
beer
is
still
great
but
the
experience
is
not
overall
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
its
quite
sweet
yet
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
as
its
easy
to
drink
and
only
3
00
for
a
pint
this
stuff
is
excellent
great
look
outstanding
and
well
rounded
flavors
even
a
great
feel
a
masterpiece
poured
a
2
white
head
with
took
awhile
to
dissipate
to
lace
clear
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
tiny
bubbles
smell
has
corn
and
is
also
yeasty
taste
is
a
fairly
simply
bmc
flavor
profile
with
corn
and
grass
however
the
body
is
smoother
and
richer
and
the
finish
has
both
some
sweet
and
sour
to
it
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
typical
pale
beer
if
you
have
never
had
it
give
it
a
try
it
is
a
well
crafted
ale
overall
the
beer
is
good
but
i
suspect
that
the
bottles
i
have
access
to
are
not
treated
will
during
shipment
and
storage
at
my
local
shops
i
cant
give
points
for
what
i
expect
the
beer
tastes
like
when
the
hop
character
is
fresher
but
i
wish
that
i
could
the
malt
character
is
brilliant
as
is
the
mouthfeel
with
some
hops
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
hop
character
i
could
see
falling
in
love
with
this
beer
my
pour
netted
me
twoplus
fingers
of
eggnogcolored
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
deep
gold
and
midas
would
have
approved
nose
had
a
caramelbuttery
sweetness
up
front
with
a
grassy
hoppiness
behind
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mild
bitterness
initially
on
the
tongue
then
giving
way
to
a
mild
sweetness
finish
was
equally
mild
and
pleasant
it
was
not
bad
but
it
did
not
strike
me
as
anything
terribly
special
either
have
i
just
committed
sacrilege
this
brew
would
go
well
with
anything
from
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches
to
a
stuffed
grouse
o
a
very
nice
goto
beer
thats
readily
available
in
lots
of
american
cities
ive
always
liked
their
stouts
and
their
nut
brown
but
i
never
picked
this
one
up
until
now
i
think
because
i
interpreted
the
organic
marketing
as
some
kind
of
gimmick
like
other
reviews
have
noted
this
is
a
great
candidate
for
a
evening
session
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
the
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
is
strong
with
yeast
sweet
nutty
malt
with
earthy
and
herbal
hop
tones
the
taste
is
a
little
metallic
but
its
not
bad
at
all
there
are
flavors
of
raisin
bread
nuts
and
lemon
its
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
medium
shade
of
amber
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
head
fizzles
away
pretty
fast
leaving
just
a
few
spots
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
mostly
malt
to
me
not
too
much
hop
aroma
or
anything
coming
from
it
besides
maybe
a
little
yeast
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
buiscuty
with
some
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
not
overly
watered
down
or
anything
like
that
but
its
not
heavy
either
not
a
bad
brew
to
try
poured
this
beer
into
a
bottle
poured
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
the
beer
looked
very
good
with
a
murky
light
amber
look
to
it
it
smelled
sweet
with
a
fruit
smell
and
a
light
hint
of
bananas
i
was
very
disappointed
when
it
came
time
to
taste
the
beer
it
has
a
lot
weaker
of
a
taste
then
i
was
expecting
and
wanting
i
did
not
rate
the
beer
down
too
much
for
this
because
i
would
have
been
rating
the
beer
on
my
expectations
and
not
the
quality
of
the
beer
the
after
taste
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
interesting
after
taste
that
i
cannot
place
final
thoughts
i
think
the
beer
would
be
good
during
the
summer
while
relaxing
in
a
chair
outside
maybe
too
descriptive
on
that
one
cheers
d
wonderful
a
topnotch
session
beer
o
very
sessionable
beer
that
would
go
down
well
at
any
time
appearance
is
a
light
amber
tone
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
light
some
floral
as
well
as
citrus
there
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
some
caramel
orange
lowkey
hops
malt
in
the
finish
mf
is
leaning
towards
light
some
carbonation
there
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
goes
well
with
almost
any
meal

d
certainly
a
beer
that
you
could
put
away
a
few
of
in
quick
time
being
a
new
fan
of
the
brewery
i
had
high
expectations
so
this
was
somewhat
disappointing
overall
because
it
is
medium
bodied
yet
simple
and
easydrinking
organic
best
ale
can
pair
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
last
night
i
enjoyed
it
with
a
warm
israeli
couscous
dish
that
was
flavored
with
lemon
and
loaded
with
veggies
the
pairing
was
perfect
this
beer
would
also
go
well
with
roasted
chicken
a
variety
of
seafood
dishes
or
indian
food
sometimes
the
best
beer
and
cheese
pairings
are
easy
to
find
if
you
stay
local
to
the
region
try
this
beer
with
a
mild
english
cheese
such
as
caerphilly
the
earthy
creaminess
of
this
cows
milk
cheese
will
pair
beautifully
with
the
citric
qualities
in
the
beer
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
little
brew
that
i
really
did
not
even
know
that
i
had
it
was
quite
good
and
defiantly
something
worth
taking
a
shot
at
i
would
defiantly
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
can
it
might
surprise
you
a
bit
as
it
comes
through
with
a
lot
more
quality
then
i
thought
it
would
overall
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
style
that
id
like
to
see
more
of
another
fine
offering
from
samuel
smiths
taste
is
full
grains
and
and
toasted
biscuits
hops
are
perfectly
balanced
in
this
one
and
feature
light
lemon
and
herbal
leafy
notes
finish
is
very
clean
and
dry
with
bread
crust
and
a
hint
of
earth
feel
is
soft
and
supple
with
a
gentle
fine
carbonation
another
super
session
ale
from
this
brewery
drinkability
good
smell
and
taste
and
very
much
a
classic
english
ale
taste
but
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
went
well
with
a
meal
curry
chicken
but
satisfying
in
its
own
right
right
tasty
and
unlike
the
last
one
i
feel
like
another
pint
i
think
the
last
one
i
had
truly
was
older
this
one
is
quite
good
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
that
fizzes
down
to
a
tight
rim
of
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
very
floral
in
the
aroma
not
as
sweet
smelling
as
the
nonorganic
version
good
biscuity
malt
base
with
some
lemon
zest
tangerine
butterscotch
with
an
orange
marmalade
finish
interesting
the
organic
version
seems
more
complex
but
you
cant
beat
the
balance
of
the
origional
pale
ale
feels
a
bit
full
in
the
mouth
for
a
pale
ale
but
that
is
a
minor
complaint
samuel
smiths
are
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
great
to
share
with
some
good
conversation
o
less
earthy
than
the
nonorganic
version
and
more
sour
also
ends
up
tasting
a
bit
sweeter
or
is
that
astringency
i
think
i
prefer
the
other
one
more
but
this
one
is
also
very
well
balanced
d
man
i
think
i
could
get
a
sixer
for
10
99
which
is
great
for
an
english
beer
but
is
a
number
one
beer
not
really
the
smoothest
pale
ale
ever
but
this
hop
head
needs
more
one
finger
head
of
white
course
bubbles
and
good
clinging
lace
from
the
pour
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
of
malt
oats
barley
and
a
flower
honey
great
taste
full
of
flavor
but
not
heavy
flavors
of
roasted
wheat
barley
malt
and
hops
nothing
fancy
in
this
beer
just
a
great
well
rounded
flavorful
ale
a
bit
pricey
but
a
pretty
good
brew
for
the
money
this
beer
pours
a
nice
buttery
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
film
the
smell
is
a
bit
unusual
for
a
pale
ale
as
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
yeasty
esters
giving
off
clean
fruit
aromas
this
is
over
the
top
of
a
bit
of
mineral
tang
which
seems
standard
for
lighter
beers
from
sam
smith
and
a
base
of
pale
malt
the
fruit
is
upfront
in
the
taste
but
followed
by
classic
pale
ale
bready
malt
flavor
this
is
balanced
by
just
enough
hop
bitterness
yet
the
other
hop
characteristics
are
relatively
low
key
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
lively
as
the
carbonation
is
moderate
to
high
and
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
and
clean
leaving
a
bit
of
bitterness
and
light
fruit
overall
a
surprising
beer
that
is
quite
different
from
samuel
smiths
standard
pale
ale
this
beer
has
a
yellow
colour
and
a
decent
head
that
fades
into
fullsurface
lacing
in
about
a
minute
the
smell
is
of
piney
hops
and
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
first
flavour
i
tasted
was
maltiness
and
a
slight
amount
of
yeast
it
has
a
hoppy
apple
cider
aftertaste
my
bottle
was
flat
in
the
mouth
i
think
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
given
that
it
lacked
of
carbonation
and
wasnt
especially
hoppy
overall
a
very
drinkable
refreshing
ale
with
some
nice
malt
depth
to
it
though
overall
fairly
straightforward
i
would
buy
this
again
verdict
wellpriced
and
very
decent
effort
worth
trying
wow
much
more
hoppy
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
brewery
but
just
enough
to
play
nice
with
the
expected
subtle
yet
complex
malt
moreys
bottom
line
i
bought
a
single
bottle
at
wegmans
and
im
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
that
being
said
its
pretty
malty
but
it
still
taste
pretty
good
no
sediment
and
it
still
had
ample
carbonation
if
you
are
a
fan
of
malty
ales
this
wont
disappoint
poured
a
moderately
hazy
ambergold
lots
of
apple
notes
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
with
an
unfiltered
apple
juice
note
dominating
the
flavor
profile
some
distinctively
caramel
malt
also
plays
a
central
role
hopping
was
modest
and
the
beer
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
overall
a
mellow
beer
mild
but
has
some
complexities
nice
session
beer
overall
a
wellmade
beer
but
ultimately
a
little
disappointing
drinkability
a
lot
of
english

down
it
has
been
a

brew
i
was
always
frustrated
with
their
use
of
clear
bottles
and
no
freshness
dates
it
appears
they
have
finally
switched
to
brown
bottles
such

not

a

overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
epa
nothing
extraordinary
but
its
got
some
niceties
that
are
worth
searching
for
worth
a
shot
a
quintessential
english
pale
ale
the
epitome
of
a
good

beer
d
exactly
the
type
of
beer
youd
want
to
slog

poured
into
a

glass
with
two
fingers
of
head
notes
of

honey
and
citrus
tastes
like
heaven
if

were
made

that
consisted
of
a
slight
hoppy
delicate
honeysuckle
flower
aged
in

really
smooth

this

ale
its
pretty
drinkable
and
good
i
dont
have
much
to
say
d
this
was
ok
but
i
was
pretty
bored
with
it
by
the
end
there
is
much
better
from
sam
smiths
very
nice
beer
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
caramelhoppy
aroma
taste
predominates
on
the
caramel
citrus
notes
at
least
that
was
what
i
was
picking
up
on
mouthfeel
was
excellent
and
the
flavor
didnt
dissipate
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
considering
i
am
not
a
samuel
smiths
fan
really
at
all
very
nice
english
style
pale
ale
d
took
some
getting
use
to
but
i
saw
myself
enjoying
this
one
to
the
end
would
drink
this
organic
brew
during
a
hot
day
notes
up
until
this
beer
samuel
smiths
organic
line
have
mainly
been
bigtime
hits
with
one
beer
that
i
would
label
a
miss
organic
ale
falls
somewhere
in
between
but
its
closer
to
a
hit
than
a
miss
maybe
not
a
homerun
but
a
solid
single
it
is
also
one
of
the
better
organic
ales
ive
had
not
including
samuel
smiths
own
fruit
flavored
beers
it
may
be
in
the
lower
tier
of
samuel
smith
beers
but
the
upper
tier
contains
world
class
beers
this
is
still
a
clearly
wellcrafted
unique
beer
that
i
will
gladly
consume
again
samuel
smiths
organic
ale
is
a
good
beer
maybe
not
as
good
as
other
samuel
smith
beers
its
a
very
pale
color
almost
a
little
orange
the
taste
is
interesting
a
little
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
nicely
carbonated
im
not
sure
how
many
organically
produced
beers
ive
had
but
im
guessing
not
very
many
this
was
a
decent
beer
something
different
libation
a
very
tasty
drinkable
and
balanced
epa
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
example
of
the
style
here
in
the
us
all
in
all
a
good
beer
from
samuel
smith
which
seems
to
be
the
standard
overall
this
a
flavorful
easytodrink
beer
with
the
added
bonus
of
being
made
with
organic
ingredients
pours
a
true
hazy
copper
thin
white
head
with
very
solid
lacing
for
me
has
butterscotch
and
maple
syrup
notes
that
really
lead
to
pleasant
aftertaste
i
love
the
majority
of
the
tadcaster
beers
and
this
one
is
another
that
lines
up
quite
nicely
really
a
beautiful
beer
in
the
glass
so
long
as
you
arent
a
clarity
nazi
has
a
real
small
brewery
feel
to
it
bravo
subtle
flavors
of
toasted
malt
and
toffee
some
butterscotch
and
a
slight
metallic
note
that
i
find
consistently
in
this
brewers
selections
perhaps
something
with
the
local
water
or
yeast
strain
even
mouthfeel
a
bit
dry
and
tannic
subtle
and
delicately
flavored
traditional
english
style
ale
d
this
is
a
extremely
well
crafted
beer
the
balance
is
perfect
highly
drinkable
sweet
malts
rounded
out
by
hops
that
dont
over
power
the
beer
this
is
an
outstanding
ale
and
seems
to
be
a
prime
example
of
what
a
english
pale
ale
should
be
this
is
my
bench
mark
for
the
style
so
far
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
and
has
a
lot
of
complex
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
even
more
interesting
taste
similar
to
the
organic
lager
but
this
seems
sweeter
in
an
unsugary
way
if
that
makes
sense
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
very
slight
nothing
simple
here
something
well
rounded
expanding
though
not
quite
complex
either
simply
refreshing
and
not
a
run
of
the
mill
ale
at
all
perfect
balance
of
viscosity
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
a
session
candidate
for
sure
not
what
i
expected
for
the
style
but
ok
none
the
less
a
good
crisp
and
well
carbonated
beer
golden
in
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
grainy
and
fruity
nose
with
an
even
sweeter
taste
there
is
a
good
pinch
of
hops
but
not
too
much
primary
flavours
are
grain
a
bit
of
metallic
and
sweet
malts
nose
lacks
but
this
may
be
because
of
the
temperature
but
considering
this
is
a
session
beer
it
should
be
able
to
perform
at
colder
temps
overall
an
average
ale
very
pleasant
and
not
as
bitter
as
most
epas
d
drinkability
is
very
good
it
has
a
very
good
flavor
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
makes
it
very
sessionable
d
this
is
really
a
fine
drinking
beer
easy
to
drink
quite
a
bit
of
it
and
also
good
enough
to
want
to
come
back
to
again
d
very
drinkable
and
very
complex
you
must
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
before
you
can
accurately
review
it
drinks
pretty
well
and
as
i
drink
it
i
like
it
a
bit
more
certainly
worth
the
try
and
definately
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
great
english
pale
ale
it
doesnt
really
add
anything
to
the
style
but
the
execution
is
excellent
d
after
the
first
few
sips
i
wasnt
impressed
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
left
wanting
more
easily
drinkable
but
with
enough
flavor
and
balance
that
when
you
come
around
you
realize
what
a
good
beer
it
is
it
is
a
beer
well
fit
for
summer
and
as
an
every
day
drinker
something
everybody
could
enjoy
and
grow
accustomed
to
definitely
a
beer
i
would
suggest
everybody
to
try
at
least
once
d
flavorful
and
well
balanced
combination
make
this
very
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
small
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
near
equal
balance
of
malt
and
hops
toffee
biscuit
herbs
and
flowers
this
aroma
has
nice
complexity
which
keeps
me
thinking
it
isnt
the
strongest
aroma
out
there
but
i
would
trade
strength
for
complexity
any
day
the
taste
is
has
the
same
equilibrium
as
the
aroma
there
is
nice
malt
up
front
and
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
it
lacks
a
little
of
the
pizazz
that
the
aroma
has
but
it
is
solid
nonetheless
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
if
it
were
available
in
sixfour
pack
form
it
would
quickly
become
a
regular
session
beer
for
me
i
single
bottles
i
can
see
myself
having
it
every
now
and
then
served
up
this
beer
in
s
standard
pint
glass
very
clear
golden
caramel
coloring
with
hardly
any
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
and
simple
with
that
nice
fruity
british
ale
yeast
ester
character
mixed
with
the
smell
of
sweet
caramel
malts
a
very
clean
aroma
this
is
a
tasty
beer
first
flavors
are
the
mild
fruity
english
ale
esters
which
mix
in
very
well
with
the
crystal
malts
to
form
a
beautifully
balanced
dry
refreshing
ale
the
finish
is
slightly
crisp
and
dries
the
mouth
kind
of
like
tea
does
in
a
very
refreshing
sort
of
way
the
carbonation
is
plenty
strong
but
not
excessive
and
easily
bites
through
the
body
of
this
beer
i
could
drink
several
of
these
this
is
such
a
well
balanced
beer
i
could
easily
see
this
beer
being
passed
by
as
nothing
substantial
but
for
those
who
value
balance
subtlety
drinkability
and
above
all
great
flavor
then
do
give
this
one
a
try
does
this
fine
brewery
make
a
bad
beer
methinks
not
man
i
just
gotta
get
to
this
brewery
the
next
time
im
in
great
britain
another
recommended
highquality
long
drink
from
samuel
smiths
brewery
bravo
huzzah
english
style
pale
ales
are
the
epicenter
of
beer
stouts
off
to
port
and
lagers
to
starboard
i
always
found
this
brewery
to
be
good
not
great
but
this
beer
is
great
the
head
is
thick
and
white
the
aroma
is
the
wonderful
scent
of
rich
ale
not
daisies
or
tar
pits
or
tequila
the
mouthfeel
is
full
not
fizzy
not
syrupy
but
liquid
that
can
taste
flavorful
while
doing
what
beer
is
meant
to
do
quench
your
thirst
their
is
a
fine
balance
in
this
beer
that
allows
hints
of
sweetness
and
grain
to
come
and
go
on
your
tongue
without
as
much
dry
bitter
flavor
as
an
english
style
esb
smiths
regular
old
brewery
pale
ale
i
find
a
bit
murkier
and
more
malt
dominated
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
drinker
and
a
great
reminder
to
me
that
beer
is
about
the
beautiful
flavor
not
just
an
excuse
for
intellectual
excercise
ambergold
in
appearance
with
a
thin
quicksettling
white
head
sweet
malt
smell
fairly
like
corn
syrup
and
a
mellow
hop
presence
taste
is
a
little
bit
better
balanced
but
still
a
bit
syrupy
nice
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
nice
as
the
organic
lager
overall
i
love
sam
smiths
and
this
isnt
a
bad
entry
into
their
line
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
a
crisp
refreshing
ale
and
yet
another
well
crafted
gem
from
samuel
smith
an
anytime
brew
and
an
all
timer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
or
on
its
own
its
relatively
complex
but
not
too
heavy
not
quite
what
i
had
expected
being
as
it
was
slightly
a
darker
gold
then
i
had
expected
had
a
white
head
which
disappeared
swiftly
the
taste
was
sweet
like
molasses
the
smell
was
something
like
honey
bread
with
other
spices
not
too
much
bitter
hop
in
there
the
beer
had
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
it
was
rather
drinkable
as
it
was
sweet
and
went
down
easy
d
when
you
are
looking
for
a
good
beer
that
does
everything
well
but
doesnt
really
stand
in
any
particular
way
this
is
it
this
beer
would
please
about
any
appreciator
of
good
beer
i
could
drink
buckets
of
this
stuff
drinkability
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
but
one
that
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
i
dont
think
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
i
was
ready
for
something
else
when
i
finished
the
bottle
d
quite
a
good
brew
unfortunately
i
am
stuck
drinking
this
from
a
bottle
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
the
taste
is
pleasant
fresh
crisp
extremely
even
consistent
balanced
and
wellintegrated
throughout
from
start
to
finish
it
is
lightly
sweet
with
light
balancing
bitterness
plus
a
hint
of
fruityyeasty
sweetsour
and
light
zesty
tartness
all
integrated
extremely
well
playing
together
simultaneously
and
complementing
each
other
rather
than
clashing
it
tastes
of
faintly
tart
fruit
leaves
citrus
esp
lemon
with
hints
of
yeasty
toast
and
butter
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
with
a
lingering
leafycitrusy
bitterness
balanced
by
faintly
buttered
toast
sweetness
the
feel
is
firm
not
quite
oily
and
zesty
and
lively
poured
with
a
clear
yellowgold
appearance
large
head
that
slowly
dissipated
into
patchy
lacing
aromas
are
quite
rich
in
cloves
florals
grains
citrus
orange
and
a
slight
woody
hint
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
simpler
but
wonderfully
sweet
and
juicy
slight
biscuit
tones
mixed
wonderfully
with
the
citrus
flavor
just
not
as
complex
as
the
aromas
might
make
it
seem
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
does
allow
the
drink
to
be
enjoyed
as
a
light
sweet
ale
overall
a
great
organic
ale
overall
maybe
i
let
this
one
warm
a
little
too
much
but
something
about
that
buttery
earthy
hopcharacter
which
reminds
me
of
bass
makes
me
want
to
steer
clear
of
english
pale
ales
for
a
while
not
a
bad
beer
it
poured
and
looked
exactly
like
i
thought
it
would
looked
like
a
fullers
pale
ale
which
is
the
only
other
true
english
pale
ale
i
can
compare
it
to
it
had
a
nice
golden
hue
with
a
whispy
white
head
that
vanished
quickly
and
with
little
a
trace
not
much
going
on
with
the
smell
it
was
slightly
bitter
light
on
the
hops
and
somewhat
yeasty
it
tasted
okay
to
me
this
is
a
very
good
english
pale
ale
however
i
have
never
had
one
that
has
had
a
wow
factor
or
anything
close
to
it
did
not
change
my
perception
of
this
style
as
a
classic
yet
average
ale
i
do
prefer
more
hops
and
a
bit
more
complexity
but
for
the
style
it
was
nice
did
not
notice
much
of
an
aftertaste
except
for
slight
bitterness
had
thinnish
to
medium
mouthfeel
like
most
pale
ales
this
one
scores
fairly
well
on
the
drinkability
very
impressive
session
ale
i
think
that
this
lends
very
well
to
its
popularity
distinct
floral
taste
the
hops
are
present
and
the
typical
ale
elements
such
as
sweetness
and
smoothness
are
there
i
get
a
strong
scent
and
flavor
of
honey
and
molasses
the
aftertaste
and
finish
is
bitter
typical
of
all
sam
smith
beers
tasty
easy
to
drink
future
outlook
not
a
favorite
style
but
as
with
most
sam
smith
a
dependable
beer
that
i
would
happily
go
to
for
a
change
of
pace
or
in
a
pinch
upon
edit
wow
i
must
have
gotten
a
really
old
bottle
cuz
my
grades
deviate
pretty
far
south
drinkability
quite
possibly
the
best
or
one
of
the
top
few
best
organic
beers
i
have
tried
i
will
try
the
other
organic
lager
tonight
very
impressed
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
good
representation
of
style
mild
kick
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
that
ive
had
its
a
nice
session
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
jolly
good
d
good
in
a
bottle
in
australia
but
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
tapped
from
cask
in
england
classic
english
pale
ale
the
organic
version
somehow
id
neglected
to
review
this
in
the
past
pours
golden
with
a
reasonable
head
that
fades
to
a
finely
beaded
thin
ring
smells
of
biscuity
malt
and
some
very
light
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
also
quite
biscuity
but
there
is
also
a
juicy
sweetness
and
some
slightly
more
prominent
hop
presence
very
balanced
and
tasty
extremely
smooth
with
just
the
tiniest
hint
of
chalk
in
the
finish
clean
and
juicy
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
poured
into
a
bass
pint
glass
nice
light
palegolden
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
lacies
the
entire
session
aroma
is
of
ice
tea
brewed
in
the
sun
with
nutmeg
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
the
fuggles
and
noble
hop
throughout
the
bitterness
is
in
the
aftertaste
and
it
is
strong
the
body
is
full
a
smooth
creaminess
is
there
and
that
never
leaves
your
palate
the
brew
makes
me
want
to
enjoy
a
bunch
of
these
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
12
inch
head
with
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
a
blend
of
malt
hops
and
butter
fits
the
style
quite
nicely
smooth
chewy
with
low
carbonation
tastes
mostly
of
sweet
malts
with
a
hop
finish
theres
a
hint
of
a
buttery
background
not
too
sweet
overall
which
is
appreciated
by
me
theres
a
buttermalt
aftertaste
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
counterbalances
any
sweetness
imparted
by
the
maltbutter
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
a
try
organic
is
synonymous
with
overpriced
average
beer
its
almost
like
it
has
become
a
warning
label
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
you
think
it
would
be
but
the
ingerdients
are
organic
and
we
think
that
is
a
decnt
tradeoff
for
actual
flavor
spare
me
overall
this
a
flavorful
easytodrink
brew
with
the
added
bonus
of
being
made
with
organic
ingredients
pours
clear
golden
brown
with
decent
white
head
after
an
aggressive
pur
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
bubble
film
grainy
aroma
with
apples
and
a
citrus
maybe
lemon
hops
the
fruitiness
was
a
little
unexpected
for
me
but
i
get
apples
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
pretty
well
balanced
aftertaste
that
has
a
nice
bitterness
i
am
still
getting
a
fruity
yeast
flavor
similar
to
the
aroma
well
carbonated
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
i
hadnt
had
this
in
a
long
time
and
it
was
a
pleasant
reminder
of
the
british
style
pale
less
hopped
than
most
american
versions
and
pleasant
to
drink
d
a
well
made
beer
though
i
doubt
id
put
into
a
regular
rotation
as
i
said
there
was
something
about
the
taste
that
was
offputting
this
bottle
was
enough
for
me
to
seriously
consider
a
trip
to
england
just
to
try
this
one
fresh
there
are
english
pale
ales
and
then
there
are
really
great
english
pale
ales
this
is
wonderful
stuff
a
nice
hazy
gold
in
the
glass
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
nice
frothy
head
touch
of
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
same
in
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
and
absolutely
nothing
else
very
enjoyable
drinkable
and
just
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
without
trying
to
hard
fresh
tasting
even
though
the
12
liter
bottle
looked
liked
it
had
been
on
the
shelf
for
awhile
and
the
best
part
about
english
ales
are
when
they
begin
to
warm
they
taste
even
better
poured
into
a
good
size
handle
glass
and
got
a
rich
head
but
this
didnt
last
very
long
or
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
but
is
sweet
and
malty
flavour
is
all
treacle
and
malt
sugar
with
just
enough
hoppy
fruit
to
prevent
cloying
the
bitterness
balances
perfectly
and
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
interest
in
the
fruitmalt
mix
carbonation
is
low
as
it
should
be
and
i
found
it
to
be
thoroughly
drinkable
and
regretting
i
only
bought
one
bottle
good
beer
very
solid
ale
pours
a
moderate
head
with
sticky
bubbles
golden
color
seems
like
i
am
perhaps
tasting
a
bit
of
fruit
the
smell
is
mostly
faint
to
my
nose
but
what
i
detect
is
pleasant
ultimately
this
is
a
well
done
beer
and
scores
well
particularly
if
you
are
an
ale
fan
thoroughly
enjoying
it
as
i
type
its
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
and
im
even
tempted
to
say
that
its
fun
to
drink
samuel
smith
continues
to
produce
the
highest
quality
beers
in
any
category
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
good
for
a
splurge
once
in
a
while
tastes
very
fresh
despite
traveling
thousands
of
miles
to
get
here
incredibly
so
actually
very
satisfying
and
well
balanced
refreshing
and
nicely
hopped
this
beer
is
meant
to
drink
slowely
i
feel
it
would
be
horribly
lame
to
chug
this
beer
and
miss
out
on
the
complex
balance
between
hop
and
malt
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
like
it
and
want
more
good
beer
a
tad
expensive
to
drink
every
day
for
me
but
i
found
a
new
go
to
beer
when
i
dont
know
what
to
drink
drinkability
decent
but
probably
not
feasible
for
my
budget
drinkability
a
fine
respectable
ale
keenly
drinkable
and
reasonably
refreshing
really
puts
you
in
the
mood
for
black
tea
with
a
small
splash
of
milk
the
following
morning
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
malty
and
highly
appealing
it
fills
the
need
for
a
crisp
yet
satisfying
beer
d
very
drinkable
with
smooth
carbonation
that
doesnt
get
in
the
way
another
quality
beer

highly

a
good

beer
for
sure
this
beer
proves
that
you
can
get
a
good
organic
beer
i
will
probably
buy
it
again
im
actually
rating
this
higher
than
i
figured
it
would
rate
d
very
high
nice
session
beer
honestly
i
think
this
is
the
first
samuel
smith
ive
ever
had
what
else
have
i
been
missing
i
will
definately
drink
this
beer
again
and
again
this
is
my
first
sam
smith
beer
so
now
im
amped
to
try
out
the
rest
of
the
line
great
find
t
wow
session
ale
i
have
recently
started
trying
the
sam
smith
lineup
and
have
not
be
upset
about
a
single
one
even
the
cider
sam
smith
seems
to
be
the
honda
civic
of
the
beer
world
nothing
flashy
simple
5
alc
reliable
taste
love
this
stuff
d
i
would
love
to
have
an
old
brewery
pale
ale
and
another
organic
ale
to
compare
side
by
side
and
realistically
that
endeavor
is
not
out
of
my
reach
maybe
there
will
be
a
thread
about
it
some
day
anyone
who
appreciates
the
fruity
not
so
dry
angles
of
an
english
pale
ale
will
fall
in
love
with
this
instantly
completely
session
worthy
if
i
found
a
pub
with
this
on
tap
i
could
easily
make
it
my
home
away
from
home
its
organic
production
makes
it
even
more
appealing
to
me
especially
in
todays
world
of
chemicals
and
processing
for
now
though
this
is
a
rare
gem
that
i
must
travel
across
30
minutes
of
rugged
american
highway
to
acquire
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
just
rather
boring
lacking
a
kick
or
some
flair
would
be
a
good
sessionwithfood
beer
when
you
want
the

be

star
typed
this
limited
review
into
my
cell
phone
ambery
gold
color
white
head
has
a
vanilla
nutty
smell
and
taste
this
beer
was
incredibly
smooth
and
silky
has
a
hop
profile
that
matches
the
malts
very
well
not
too
bitter
this
ale
had
a
decent
complexity
and
balance
nothing
onedimensional
here
and
a
great
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
made
it
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
if
not
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
balanced
english
pale
highly
suggested
d
perfect
i
cant
imagine
a
better
example
of
this
style
it
is
supposed
to
be
drunk
without
too
much
fanfare
its
like
a
good
friend
that
you
can
rely
on
but
wont
surprise
you
with
a
ton
of
drama
or
bells
and
whistles
no
arrogant
bastards
here
just
an
old
mate
at
the
pub
samuel
smiths
organic
ale
is
tasty
crisp
mediumbodied
and
wellcarbonated
making
the
brew
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
the
appearance
was
a
gold
or
copper
color
it
was
hazy
not
much
head
and
no
lacing
it
smelled
like
toasty
hops
and
toasty
caramel
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
and
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
was
clean
hops
with
a
trace
of
honey
as
if
it
was
made
with
mineral
water
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thick
and
warm
it
was
medium
bodied
and
a
little
bitter
this
was
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
ive
definitely
had
better
from
sam
smiths
perhaps
im
not
fully
understanding
the
style
but
this
is
a
bland
almost
beer
that
i
feel
doesnt
really
deliver
the
flavors
are
bizzare
and
out
of
synch
with
each
other
pours
a
lovely
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
retains
pretty
well
nose
is
a
little
appley
with
nice
maltiness
taste
follows
malt
some
dark
fruite
a
bit
of
apple
and
some
english
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
and
the
drikability
is
as
good
as
it
gets
whenever
i
quaff
this
brew
i
think
of
grilling
my
fresh
caught
pike
burbot
or
salmon
on
my
little
charcoal
grill
on
the
porch
of
my
cabin
watching
the
sunset
behind
the
hills
and
forest
reflect
off
of
the
glassy
waters
of
shell
lake
drinkability
amazingly
sessionable
enough
said
this
is
one
ill
be
coming
back
to
the
beer
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
not
too
many
dominant
tastes
this
made
it
an
ideal
beer
for
an
night
out
the
only
fault
i
can
find
with
it
is
that
it
is
not
widely
available
in
scotland
this
beer
is
an
excellent
authentic
english
style
very
drinkable
ale
the
consumate
english
ale
there
is
the
unmistakeable
flavor
of
english
hops
balanced
out
nicely
with
a
roasted
malt
backbone
the
organic
ingredients
help
create
a
fresher
experience
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
nicely
carbonated
a
satsifying
and
deliciously
drinkable
ale
from
sam
smith
but
then
again
is
there
any
other
kind
in
the
mouth
you
are
left
with
a
slight
hop
zing
on
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
smooth
i
could
drink
these
all
day
poured
into
a
pint
glass
copper
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
some
bubble
columns
help
the
retention
and
a
little
lace
adorns
the
glass
aroma
is
pretty
average
overly
sweet
malt
with
some
fruitiness
flavor
is
sour
fruit
and
grainy
malt
dont
really
enjoy
this
one
at
all
high
on
carbonation
and
low
on
body
and
flavor
not
something
im
going
to
buy
again
d
this
is
a
good
beer
right
down
the
middle
its
balanced
and
not
too
overpowering
or
lacking
its
light
and
has
good
flavor
which
would
make
it
a
great
session
beer
i
really
wish
it
had
more
head
and
aroma
but
im
guessing
that
might
come
with
the
organic
territory
well
then
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
experience
one
of
the
most
quaffable
ales
ive
yet
to
sample
not
boisterous
yet
not
a
wallflower
either
an
ale
youd
want
to
slow
dance
with
all
night
because
of
how
comfortable
and
accomodating
it
is
try
and
sneak
in
a
smooch
here
and
there
also
when
you
get
the
chance
d
simply
fantasitic
one
of
the
most
pleasant
surprises
in
a
drink
great
any
day
overall
a
very
nice
light
bright
wellbalanced
refreshing
ale
ill
definitely
have
this
on
hand
for
the
springsummer
easy
drinker
pours
a
solid
copper
color
with
a
good
looking
white
head
and
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
as
the
beer
drained
nose
is
nice
lots
of
caramel
malt
some
light
fruitiness
maybe
citrus
hops
in
there
as
well
definitely
sweet
and
quite
nice
unfortunately
the
flavor
drops
the
ball
basically
some
mild
malt
which
is
seriously
overpowered
by
the
fizziness
of
the
beer
mouthfeels
a
little
biting
for
me
liking
too
fizzy
and
not
really
full
enough
i
dunno
nothing
really
against
this
one
it
just
sort
of
bored
me
ive
actually
been
disappointed
by
sam
smith
before
and
this
one
is
unfortunately
no
exception
i
know
english
pale
ales
arent
usually
flavor
explosions
but
this
one
just
couldnt
hold
my
interest
this
moderately
hazy
copper
colored
ale
offered
a
decent
head
that
dissipated
quickly
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
brew
was
pungent
dominated
by
citrus
and
floral
odors
light
and
refreshing
with
pronounced
hops
and
a
straightforward
yet
layered
taste
the
beer
was
smooth
and
lingered
on
the
tongue
for
just
long
enough
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
would
go
over
well
any
time
of
year
and
would
probably
be
enjoyed
by
sophisticated
and
novice
beer
palates
alike
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
epas
usually
but
this
is
quite
tasty
recommended
and
organic
to
boot
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
little
bit
of
body
and
nice
carbonation
this
beer
is
unassuming
and
complex
at
the
same
time
it
is
light
enough
to
drink
all
day
and
tastes
good
enough
to
keep
your
interest
the
whole
time
this
is
a
traditional
british
ale
malty
slightly
sour
and
full
bodied
i
wish
it
had
more
hop
to
it
for
balance
an
english
pale
ale
great
pour
and
nice
velvety
head
light
amber
in
color
pleasant
mouth
feel
followed
by
a
slight
sweet
and
bitter
aftertaste
i
really
dont
like
sweet
when
it
comes
to
beer
not
what
i
expected
from
such
a
great
brewery
i
was
a
little
disappointed
oh
well
i
wont
buy
it
again
goldish
amber
with
white
fluffy
medium
lasting
head
smells
musky
sweaty
and
simply
not
good
at
all
ive
had
skunky
beers
that
smelled
possibly
better
taste
is
somewhat
smooth
creamy
and
just
grossly
sweaty
and
yeasty
kind
of
like
moist
dirty
laundry
not
good
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
ever
and
undrinkable
for
me
although
it
didnt
taste
like
a
beer
that
had
gone
bad
i
simply
didnt
like
this
one
and
samuel
smiths
lager
and
nut
brown
ale
were
quite
good
another
worldclass
brew
from
samuel
smith
their
organic
samples
are
really
aboveandbeyond
and
certainly
noticeable
for
their
superior
quality
that
strangles
the
competition
their
organic
lager
was
superb
and
this
is
as
good
if
not
better
an
amazing
english
pale
ale
wonderful
bronzecolored
copper
appearance
with
minimal
head
strong
butter
aroma
with
breadandbutter
flavor
with
a
strong
caramel
and
honey
taste
that
stands
out
for
its
pure
rich
crisp
and
clean
taste
wonderful
flavor
that
is
truly
satisfying
another
definite
winner
from
samuel
smith
amazing
sample
that
scores
tremendous
points
for
its
crisp
lucid
taste
that
hits
home
and
is
really
pleasing
with
its
authentic
and
pure
taste
definitely
recommended
quote
easy
drinking
but
there
are
better
offerings
from
the
famed
brewery
i
dont
know
if
the
ingredients
simply
being
organic
makes
the
beer
taste
better
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
di
didnt
think
at
the
first
sip
that
i
would
like
this
beer
two
minutes
later
it
was
gone
this
may
beer
the
ultimate
session
beer
not
something
that
is
distinctive
because
of
some
head
turning
flavor
but
distinctive
because
is
it
really
good
taste
and
drinkability
were
ok
something
i
would
drink
every
so
often
but
nothing
i
would
go
searching
for
again
pours
the
traditional
medium
amber
and
clear
rust
hues
with
very
little
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
is
very
bland
and
a
tart
malt
with
some
very
bland
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
of
the
sniff
the
taste
is
even
more
tart
and
almost
a
sur
weet
malt
hints
of
stiny
hops
in
the
midde
of
each
taste
this
was
not
what
i
expected
from
this
renowned
brewery
notes
a
great
sessionable
ale
moderate
complexity
expertly
balanced
and
highly
quaffable
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
moderately
complex
brew
yet
it
remains
smooth
and
clear
in
its
profile
the
subtle
performance
of
the
ingredients
come
together
into
a
nicely
balanced
liquid
not
only
in
flavor
but
in
mouthfeel
as
well
the
organic
selling
point
plastered
on
the
bottle
does
not
make
a
difference
to
this
drinker
this
is
simply
a
wellcrafted
brew
cheers
overall
a
decent
beer
that
uses
the
catch
of
being
an
organic
beer
which
have
yet
to
impress
one
of
the
better
organics
out
there
though
and
an
improvement
over
their
own
organic
lager
drinkability
very
satisfying
not
necessarily
something
i
would
choose
for
a
session
but
definitely
worth
sampling
pours
a
nice
pale
color
with
amber
hues
has
a
thin
head
that
recedes
shortly
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
caramel
in
the
nose
subtle
and
mild
taste
is
fruity
upfront
with
some
nice
toasted
malt
in
the
aftertaste
not
too
bad
of
a
taste
but
not
impressive
either
the
finish
is
bitter
but
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
and
the
carbo
is
light
very
good
stuff
a
good
solid
maltyness
and
a
good
stiff
english
bitterness
make
this
crisp
pale
ale
easy
to
like
great
organic
spin
on
a
classic
ale
picked
this
up
at
the
hyvee
in
galesburg
not
sure
how
long
it
had
been
on
display
but
it
came
in
a
deep
brown
bottle
so
at
least
it
was
a
little
protected
from
light
would
probably
try
this
again
but
not
as
my
first
choice
d
drinkable
but
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
wouldnt
say
used
to
brew
beer
i
think
really
quite
satisfying
d
overall
a
decent
beer
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
however
beer
poured
with
a
nice
full
creamy
head
atop
a
light
goldencopper
color
head
dissapated
quickly
leaving
some
moderate
lacing
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
fruity
quality
somewhat
champagne
like
immediately
after
pour
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
taste
hoppy
with
a
bitter
finish
a
little
dull
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
foamy
chewy
feel
with
the
relatively
low
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
all
season
ale
hazy
and
pale
in
color
with
minimal
head
very
little
aroma
english
hops
tastes
good
bright
english
hop
flavors
including
lemon
rind
floral
light
hop
spice
and
very
little
malt
present
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
maybe
paired
with
some
chips
and
malt
vinegar
d
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
appearance
and
smell
were
not
impressive
but
the
flavor
was
excellent
very
enjoyable
english
pale
ale
similar
to
their
old
brewery
pale
ale
but
the
two
are
distinct
this
is
a
bit
more
crisp
and
seems
a
bit
more
like
a
summertime
beer
if
this
were
readily
available
id
definitely
get
it

the

this
strikes
me
as
a
versatile
beer
either
for
sessioning
or
pairing
with
food
its
neutrality
is
its
greatest
virtue
drinakbility
its
fair
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
a
very
flavorful
easy
session
drinkable
to
say
the
least
very
refreshing
and
like
any
other
samuel

that
ive
tried
mighty
enjoyable
light
golden
color
on
the
pour
with
a
respectable
head
that
laces
so
so
aroma
is
toasted
malt
toffee
and
very
faint
diacetyl
on
the
palate
diacetyl
is
almost
undetectable
but
toffeeish
caramel
malt
leads
the
way
about
halfway
some
nice
cherry
esters
make
an
appearance
provided
you
arent
drinking
it
too
cold
through
the
finish
herbal
hops
emerge
and
dry
everything
out
i
get
a
favor
faint
note
of
cocoa
in
the
finish
which
seems
odd
given
the
presumed
maltbill
but
not
out
of
place
flavorwise
at
all
from
start
to
finish
there
is
a
mineral
profile
to
this
which
i
very
much
enjoy
body
is
medium
light
with
medium
carbonation
i
could
go
for
a
touch
less
extremely
drinkable
a
good
nutty
malty
very
drinkable
beer
that
doesnt
look
very
appealing
its
a
very
light
and
drinkable
brew
i
could
see
it
being
very
refreshing
in
hot
weather
and
complementing
a
wide
array
of
foods
it
would
not
be
my
first
pick
of
the
sammy
smith
family
though
poured
crystal
copper
with
thin
soapy
head
and
clingy
fine
lace
smells
of
nutty
and
leafy
hops
caramelized
malt
tastes
predominantly
of
caramel
malts
with
a
cookiedough
and
bread
center
and
slightly
dry
leafy
hop
finish
flavor
is
nice
enough
but
ultimately
a
little
thin
and
bordering
on
phenolic
thin
body
with
active
carbonation
a
bit
underwhelming
overall
another
solid
beer
from
sam
smiths
worth
a
visit
again
this
was
a
great
ale
that
would
be
great
with
a
hearty
lamb
stew
this
fall
md
spritzy
and
refreshing
yet
smooth
enough
but
the
flavour
profile
is
simplistic
with
very
faint
inputs
of
hops
submerged
by
overwhelmingly
sweet
maltiness
an
unbalanced
malty
bitter
overall
imo
not
saying
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
samuel
smiths
could
do
much
better
than
this
im
sure
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
mouthfeel
only
wakes
up
slightly
when
aggravated
otherwise
its
thin
i
wont
be
visiting
this
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
overwhelming
and
contributes
to
an
overall
drinkability
this
is
quite
a
simplistically
flavored
brew
it
is
well
made
clean
and
expressive
of
their
yeast
but
could
certainly
use
a
bit
more
flavor
why
does
organic
have
to
mean
bland
they
havent
even
gotten
to
the
flavor
threshold
of
most
of
their
other
products
this
beer
does
open
up
a
bit
as
it
warms
up
still
nothing
jumps
out
at
me
but
it
seems
to
become
a
bit
more
integrated
though
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
enough
to
hold
my
interest
drinkability
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
one
after
the
other
my
only
thought
is
that
this
may
have
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
far
too
long
i
cant
possibly
imagine
ss
producing
this
beer
in
the
state
in
which
i
sampled
it
hopefully
i
can
find
another
and
review
this
one
again
in
a
blind
test
i
would
never
believe
that
this
beer
was
from
the
same
brewery
that
produces
the
outstanding
ss
imperial
stout
rich
and
creamy
early
on
the
beer
releases
its
carbonation
and
transitions
to
a
spicy
grassy
taste
with
lasing
bitterness
into
a
dry
crisp
clean
and
bitter
linger
overall
a
pretty
solid
pale
ale
nothing
ground
breaking
but
very
drinkable
certainly
worth
a
try
although
i
have
tasted
fabulous
wines
and
beers
made
with
high
respect
for
nature
so
far
i
have
not
tasted
any
truly
outstanding
beverage
labelled
organic
this
one
is
hardly
an
exception
there
is
nothing
wrong
and
you
would
not
expect
samuel
smith
to
brew
anything
below
average
with
this
ale
however
there
is
nothing
truly
exciting
either
it
is
a
well
produced
english
ale
with
a
harmony
between
fruityness
and
bitterness
thats
it
for
any
brewer
other
than
samuel
smith
an
achievement
for
samuel
smith
slightly
disappointing
poured

in

the

a

the

a
perfect
match
for
the

a
nice

this
is

a
nicely
balanced
beer
with
high
drinkability
and
a
slightly
higher
than
expected
amount
of

a
decent
beer
but
a
really
disappointing
offering
from

knowing
what
they
can
really
do
i
could
drink
this
one
all

very
creamy

not

another

mouthfeel

nothing
about

really
makes
it
anything
to
search
out
2006
update
now
that
my
palate
has
evolved
i
have
to
give
this
high
marks
as
one
of
the
better
best
british
ales
to
be
available
here
in
the
colonies
good
thing
i
kept
giving
this
more
chances
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
organic
version
of
samuel
smiths
pale
ale
is
different
from
the
nonorganic
version
any
score
differences
between
the
two
must
therefore
be
attributable
to
mood
timing
phase
of
the
moon
etc
thats
what
makes
beer
appreciation
much
more
of
an
art
than
a
science
all
i
know
is
this
is
a
very
good
english
ale
that
ill
drink
whenever
i
get
the
chance
drinkability
this
does
not
excite
me
but
since
it
is
organic
its
probably
saving
a
tree
somewhere
not
sure
how
though
poured
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
good
foaming
head
as
time
passed
so
did
the
head
smell
was
very
malty
sweet
fruity
and
carmel
apple
like
very
little
hops
in
the
scent
maybe
even
a
bit
yeasty
taste
was
biscuit
like
and
a
bit
yeasty
sweet
fruit
flavors
as
well
little
bit
of
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
much
finish
is
very
dry
another
good
samuel
smiths
brew
mouthfeel
seems
about
right
on
for
the
style
carbonation
is
present
but
not
excessive
this
is
a
good
beer
gobs
better
than
the
bass
pints
ive
had
in
various
bars
though
i
prefer
it
on
the
colder
edge
of
the
temperature
range
i
had
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
with
food
paired
ok
with
toast
and
cheese
not
so
good
with
plum
overall
drinkability
is
great
nothing
overly
challenging
to
the
pallete
but
the
nice
bready
malty
and
yeasty
aftertaste
is
interesting
a
great
beer
to
drink
anytime
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
but
a
scant
head
that
dissappears
right
away
aroma
is
a
muted
honey
and
floral
scent
taste
is
a
rich
honeylike
malt
giving
way
to
a
slightly
citric
finish
and
just
a
delicate
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
end
medium
bodied
with
a
rounded
creamy
feel
this
is
one
unique
tasting
english
pale
ale
and
its
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
this
is
a
classy
and
distinctive
ale
and
its
organic
when
the
brits
say
its
organic
mate
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
same
ring
as
when
we
americans
say
its
organic
dude

still
ive
never
had
an
american
pale
that
tasted
remotely
like
this
i
found
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
it
appeals
to
me
as
a
summer
beer
wow
this
beer
is
fucking
great
a
perfect
example
of
a
engish
pale
ale
and
a
super
drinkable
session
beer
as
well
as
with
all
sam
smith
beers
ive
had
the
beer
looked
great
it
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
stuck
around
to
the
glass
till
the
end
the
smell
was
kind
of
subtle
but
nice
with
a
very
earthy
hop
scent
and
mild
citrus
notes
in
there
too
the
taste
was
great
and
was
close
to
the
smell
it
had
a
good
dose
of
light
malt
sweetness
and
citrus
in
the
start
which
faded
into
some
earthy
hop
flavors
and
ended
on
a
mild
sweetness
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
brew
and
i
definantly
recommend
it
taste
is
raw
and
unrefined
a
sort
of
citrus
tinge
bites
first
but
then
morphs
into
a
grainy
almost
vegetable
character
very
unique
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
sticky
or
onerous
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
a
finely
crafted
which
makes
the
most
of
its
ingredients
nice
grainy
mouthfeel
tangy
texture
very
wellplayed
in
the
mouth
an
an
immaculately
conceived
ale
well
worth
the
drinking
mouthfeel
the
body
is
very
round
and
filling
ooh
baby
pours
a
clear
goldencopper
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
that
went
down
after
a
few
minutes
smells
of
nutty
toffee
and
grassy
hops
tastes
similar
but
with
a
slight
metallic
taste
that
was
kind
of
offputting
didnt
last
too
long
but
it
was
kind
of
strange
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
slightly
dry
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
not
too
bad
but
sam
smith
makes
many
many
better
beers
this
is
gods
own
picnic
beerwhat
the
big
man
himself
drinks
after
doing
something
especially
holy
like
creating
kittens
for
us
mortals
its
perfect
for
when
youve
just
got
done
doing
something
manly
like
mowing
a
lawn
i
need
to
get
on
the
horn
and
see
about
scaring
myself
up
a
case
of
it
for
memorial
day
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
froth
head
with
very
good
retention
some
malt
and
faint
citrusy
hops
in
the
nose
taste
begins
with
earthy
malts
and
then
developed
to
a
lingering
dry
hoppy
finish
with
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
just
right
this
would
make
a
tasty
session
ale
i
could
have
a
number
of
these
in
a
row
and
not
get
bored
nicely
complex
for
the
style
a
shame
sam
smiths
does
do
more
cask
ales
this
would

lovely

for

session
this
one
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
while
maintaining
its
character
for
some
reason
this
organically
produced
version
is
crisper
cleaner
and
just
feels
better
if
you
can
dig
that
im
not
sure
what
the
cause
of
that
is
pale
ale
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
ale
i
think
it
is
a
prime
example
of
its
style
i
found
the
balance
between
hops
and
malts
to
be
impeccable
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
each
time
i
would
take
a
drink
or
a
whiff
i
would
simultaneously
experience
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
and
bouqet
of
the
hops
also
detected
some
esters
from
the
yeast
and
a
slight
doughy
flavor
very
tasty
i
enjoyed
this
much
better
than
the
sam
smiths
pale
ale
an
easy
drinking
uncomplex
beer
lacks
any
of
the
bold
characters
of
the
rest
of
the
sam
smith
line
this
stuffs
all
right
it
has
a
very
organic
taste
to
it
and
its
almost
like
fat
tire
but
paler
and
a
little
better
a
little
too
weak
and
pale
for
my
tastes
but
id
get
it
again
not
bad
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
to
buy
another
one
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
very
grainey
with
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
not
overly
appealing
to
me
the
flavor
followed
the
nose
pretty
spot
on
lots
of
raw
grainey
flavors
along
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
just
not
my
favorite
beer
the
feel
was
moderate
and
drinkability
suffered
from
the
flavor
and
nose
i
didnt
like
so
much
its
not
bad
beer
but
just
not
good
half
a
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
head
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
light
and
malty
somewhat
sweet
only
slightly
hoppy
the
taste
is
also
sweet
with
some
honey
under
a
good
malt
background
a
pinch
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
body
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
thanks
to
my
brother
jack
for
bringing
this
now
sign
up
for
ba
you
wuss
light
gold
small
cap
of

light
aroma
of

butter
and
cider
flavor
lets
that
biscuit
shine
rather
nicely
with
an
earthy
herbal
hop
note
finishes
a
little
sweet
but
welcomes
another
sip
a
nice
beer
that
does
the
english
proud
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
import
it
again
but
i
will
enjoy
it
when
i
have
it
overall
impression
forgive
the
fragmented
sentences
but
this
one
just
isnt
inspiring
me
in
general
it
has
a
good
flavor
with
an
odd
twist
as
for
style
it
seems
bang
on
drinkability
i
can
see
others
making
a
session
of
it
and
brits
needing
a
fix
now
and
then
but
for
me
it
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
pours
an
amber
color
and
foams
up
the
head
disappears
a
few
seconds
later
like
with
many
english
ales
thats
okay
i
like
the
lighter
carbonation
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
a
bit
musty
the
first
sip
is
full
of
fairly
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
and
gets
fruitier
and
juicier
towards
the
finish
a
light
bitterness
exerts
itself
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
to
the
finish
which
is
flowery
slightly
dry
and
lightly
bitter
the
taste
of
minerals
that
the
tadcaster
brewing
water
and
unique
fermentation
is
famous
for
shows
up
towards
the
finish
especially
as
this
pint
comes
up
to
room
temperature
overall
a
very
easy
drinkin
english
ale
with
some
delicate
flavors
that
are
probably
eclipsed
by
other
more
assertive
british
brews
its
certainly
worth
trying
and
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
athough
a
bit
strong
for
such
classification
the
head
was
soft
dense
and
foamy
it
faded
into
a
nice
white
collar
the
body
is
a
pale
transparent
orange
color
the
smell
is
sweet
and
pleasing
malty
with
fruity
notes
of
figs
raisins
and
a
nice
caramel
aspect
some
apples
and
maybe
some
pears
the
taste
shows
the
same
malty
and
fruity
notes
as
the
smell
caramel
figs
apples
raisins
pears
with
a
thick
herbalstraw
likegrassy
hoppiness
lasting
in
the
palate
hints
of
alcohol
kind
of
surprising
since
its
only
5
i
didnt
really
think
about
the
mouthfeel
as
i
had
this
beer
it
was
hard
to
isolate
it
from
the
taste
is
that
a
sign
of
weakness
maybe
i
enjoyed
this
organic
ale
and
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
although
i
wouldnt
want
it
to
be
an
everyday
beer
like
most
samuel
smiths
products
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
has
a
firm

uplifting

up

not

what
a

pourrich
golden
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
like
glue
aroma
is
lightly
minty
and
and
soapy
pretty
subtle
but
appetizing
taste
has
a
tea
quality
to
it
as
well
as
some
green
leafiness
with
a
lean
malt
backbone
that
holds
it
together
not
a
big
flavored
beer
just
very
appetizing
and
drinkable
like
it
should
bewhat
else
is
expected
from
samual
smiths
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
it
is
a
fine
quality
ale
and
is
sessionworthy
the
ale
poured
a
nice
golden
on
the
dark
side
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
went
to
lace
it
had
a
wonderful
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
quite
inviting
the
taste
was
rich
and
bitter
with
plenty
of
complexity
hints
of
citrus
and
banana
with
a
strong
hoppy
finish
the
feel
is
smooth
and
oily
having
a
bit
of
bubble
to
it
and
finishes
with
a
dry
hoppy
twist
that
leaves
a
fine
aftertaste
i
believe
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
a
british
bitter
i
would
put
it
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
bitters
but
it
still
wont
top
out

this

rush

creates

gassy
mouthfeel

the

warms
and
the
gas
escapes
it
becomes
a
bit
smoother
it
is
still
thin
though
i
suppose
that
contributes
some
to
an
easy
drinkability

im
not
necessarily
looking
for
a
beer
i
can
pound
still
this
is
a
great
beer
for

that
i
have
sampled

lowered
the

by
just
a

this
is
still

enjoyable
a
bready

is
backed
by
the
nice

flavor

its
just
bitter
enough
to
keep
things
interesting
its
nothing
earthshattering

it
is
a

the

not
heavy

bold
it
is
a
very

it
feels

respects

im
sure
this
organic
style
is
appreciated
by
some
and
this
may
be
a
special
product
but
i
dont
see
it
for
an
organic
ale
this
isnt
bad
at
all
ive
had
some
really
gross
organic
beer
and
this
one
was
pretty
much
normal
aside
from
the
buttery
flavor
its
a
tasty
brew
worth
a
try
at
least
once
appears
a
copper
orange
with

nice

id
heard
very
good
things
about
this
brew
and
while
i
certainly
cant
say
its
a
bad
brew
far
from
it
it
didnt
live
up
to
expectiations
pours
a

some
a

flavour
perhaps

carbonation
balance
here
less
carb
than
i
expected
which
to
me
is
a
good
thing
again
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
happily
go
back
to
it
but
i
have
a
bunch
of
other
sam
smiths
ranked
ahead
of
this
one
the
slight
sourness
of
the
beer
diminishes
its
drinkability
for
me
though
i
licked
every
last
drop
from
the
glass
cant
imagine
having
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
though
i
will
enjoy
drinking
one
of
these
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
fine
thirstquenching
summer
ale
and
id
buy
and
drink
it
again
with
that
in
mind
smells
better
than
it

and
decent
duration
nice
slightly
thick
and
complex
laces
fairly
unaromatic
and
surprisingly
grassy
for
a
pale
almost
like
a
grolsch
in
aroma
malt
is
straightforward
minimal
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
freshlybaked
white
bread
hops
are
minimal
slight
sense
of
paprika
and
reinforced
by
the
aroma
close
to
the
swallow
this
brew
has
a
tight
balance
but
unfortunately
the
body
was
pretty
lacking
to
me
a
teetertotter
balanced
by
little
weight
on
either
side
too
expensive
to
be
a
session
brew
of
choice
for
me
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
has
anyone
else
noticed
that
organic
brews
seem
to
be
a
bit
bland
and
watery
works
well
with
cooked
meats
and
poultry
a
fine
if
boring
offering
from
a
great
brewery
despite
coming
away
from
this
one
feeling
like
its
a
wellbalanced
solid
beer
the
lightweight
lagerlike
quality
was
disconcerting
for
once
a
lighter
sam
smith
beer
that
was
not
lightstruck
still
a
thorughly
average
beer
though
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
a
little
carbonation
and
thin
lacing
earthy
fruity
and
yeasty
aroma
on
this
thin
side
and
lacking
in
any
obvious
flavor
unbalanced
but
drinkable
still
ill
go
back
to
the
imperial
stout
next
time
pours
a
thin
and
pale
amber
color
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
billows
out
of
the
glass
and
coats
the
sides
while
drinking
nose
is
quite
floral
with
notes
of
fresh
lemon
and
citrus
smooth
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
taste
is
a
combination
of
a
sweet
fruitiness
and
a
bready
maltiness
blended
nicely
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
finish
is
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
ale
and
a
great
session
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
but
could
move
up
to
exceptional
with
bottleconditioning
very
drinkable
excellent
session
ale
probably
my
favorite
of
the
sam
smith
lineup
right
now
why
do
i
keep
buying
from
tadcaster
it
poured
a
nice
yellow
color
with
somewhat
of
a
head
but
the
taste
typical
it
tasted
like
bass
this
is
the
third
tadcaster
that
i
have
been
disappointed
with
i
surrender
it
is
just
a
medeocra
beer
light
with
no
body
just
a
step
above
the
macros
a
limpid
gold
color
on
the
pour
the
head
impressive
the
lace
fine
sheets
to
coat
the
glass
malt
nose
very
clean
and
fresh
slightly
sweet
at
the
start
the
top
is
flimsy
finish
is
scarcely
acidic
sparsely
hopped
quite
dry
aftertaste
very
refreshing

a

light

me
but
quite
good

bottle
a
deep
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
mild
aroma
very
faint
malt
aromas
the
initial
taste
is
not
impressive
but
then
the
fullness
and
richness
of
the
beer
hits
very
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
not
at
all
sweet
but
rather
is
a
very
biscuitrye
bread
malt
taste
which
is
very
pleasant
there
is
a
crisp
bite
of
hops
that
helps
this
beer
finish
clean
wellbalanced
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
can
imagine
sipping
this
one
throughout
the
night
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
huge
head
that
slowly
settles
down
and
leave
some
lace
clinging
to
the
glass
grain
aroma
with
some
floral
hop
scent
medium
body
and
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
starts
with
big
malt
flavors
but
not
sweet
more
of
a
grain
or
breadlike
taste
follows
with
some
light
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
hop
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
end
very
easy
and
pleasing
to
drink
would
make
a
good
session
brew
and
its
quite
tasty
shit
i
only
got
one
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
most

and
quick
foamy
white

nice
malty

with
just
a
hint
of

the
flavor
is
very
clean
with
a
small
lingering
hop
bite
and
a
drier
malt
character
very
drinkable
and
quite
a
bit
tastier
than
many
of
its
extra
pale
peers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
but
brilliant
copper
color
smells
of
of
sweet
must
with
a
little
bread
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
mild

that
transcends
into
breadlike

the

its
job
in

the

the

brews
although
its
not

in
flavor
as

pales
the
overall
balance
of
hop
malt
and

make
for
quite
a
quaffable
brew
why
doesnt
sam

used
brown
bottles
for
all
their
brews
this
one
tasted
fresh
and
definitely
unskunked
pale
lager
like
appearance
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
i
was
expecting
a
darker
brew
good

only
slight
lacing
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
was
its
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
as
is
the
case
with
quality
english
ale
this
was
also
a
smooth
tasting
brew
good
solid

with
subtle

notes
good
drinkable

this
is
what
american
brewers
of
english
style
ales
should
aspire
to
be
quintessential
balance
of
marris
otter
malts
and
herbal
english
hop
varieties
finishes
with
that
distictive
sam

yeast
twang
yummy
thanks
to
merchant
du
vin
for
the
fresh
sample
o
very
refreshing
but
one
bottle
is
enough
taste
is
juicyzesty
light
bitterness
that
just
dominates
and
lingers
it
has
light
juicy
sweetness
hint
of
mineral
the
label
has
evolved
and
is
quite
a
bit
jazzier
than
the
one
shown
above
d
this
was
a
poor
brew
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
were
all
far
below
average
it
didnt
even
look
good
not
very
easy
to
drink
either
almost
a

overall
a
great
sessionable
pale

the

not

what
makes
this
a

it
would

this

everything
i
want
from
the

what
a
shame
its
so
expensive
i
was
embezzled
with
the
first
kipling
i
had
tried
a
while
ago
this
one
wasnt
that
fresh
so
it
suffered
a
bit
especially
in
the
aroma
still
it
is
a
beer
full
of
elegance
assertive
balanced
to
perfection
and
refreshing
even
at
room
temperature
with
a
huge
drinkability
nelson
sauvin
hops
are
clearly
noticeable
here
a
refreshing
light
balanced
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
o
excellent
drinkability
great
british
ale
with
a
strong
american
profile
an
excellent
beer
great
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
that
is
quite
refreshing
and
goes
down
a
treat
with
a
solid
bitter
flavour
and
plenty
of
pine
hops
shining
through
a
great
beer
and
one
that
id
have
again
given
the
chance
despite
some
choices
made
in
its
construction
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
even
a
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
one
if
i
complain
about
it
having
less
flavour
than
it
should
then
its
almost
certainly
just
a
reflection
on
me
rather
than
the
beer
this
is
expertly
made
extremely
well
crafted
and
just
drinkable
as
hell
good
stuff
body
feels
a
bit
watery
overall
impression
a
nice
beer
to
kick
back
and
drink
in
the
sun
on
a
hot
day
as
it
does
quench
thirst
fairly
well
but
definitely
lacking
in
body
and
overall
umph
i
was
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
taste
after
such
a
fantastic
nose
advertised
as
having
initial
sweetness
and
medium
body
but
i
find
it
to
be
definitively
lacking
in
both
of
those
areas
it
drinks
very
watery
o
great
beer
well
made
and
despite
not
being
an
extreme
beer
you
could
drink
all
night
as
usual
with
thornbrisdge
unsure
whther
to

at

approve
overall
this

is

more
like
a
prototypical
american
pale

with
very

could
see
this
being

underrated
though
i
see
here
many
agree
with
me
on
its
merits
rating
it
based
on
enjoyment
rather
than
style
as
this
is
unlike
any
other
british

i
have
had
would
definitely
recommend
well

but
not

ill
be
trying

find
again

overall
this
is
pretty
great
id
have
this
on
tap
all
the
time
if
it
were
common
locally
complex
but
subtle
and
without
a
huge
abv
notes
this
is
a
tasty
fragrant
pleasing
beer
very
nice
possibly
the
best
showing
for
nelson
sauvin
ever
bright
gold
and
mostly
clear
in
the
glass
with
a
pure
white
head
of
fine
bubbles
which
lace
a
bit
the
smell
is
pretty
incredible
for
an
english
pale
ale
the
hops
give
off
a
amazing
variety
of
fruity
aromas
ranging
from
pineapple
to
citrus
including
grapefruits
and
lemons
to
mango
beyond
the
hops
there
is
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
follows
the
smell
but
the
fruit
is
toned
down
and
the
hops
end
up
tasting
more
grassy
and
floral
than
fruity
bitterness
is
fairly
restrained
as
the
hops
are
more
flavorful
than
bitter
that
moderate
bitterness
is
balanced
with
a
sweet
bready
maltiness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
moderate
with
lively
carbonation
both
of
which
are
spot
on
for
the
style
the
finish
is
just
sweet
enough
and
crisply
bitter
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
flavorful
rather
unique
epa
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
a
world
class
example
without
question
this
beer
was
good
but
a
little
confusing
overall
a
really
impressive
english
pale

easy
drinking
great
flavor
everything
was
spot
on
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
this
dont
pass
it
up
odi
am
pretty
much
always
disappointed
with
english
hoppy
beers
this
honestly
may
be
my
favorite
take
on
any
such
style
that
applies
from
the
uk
those

are
so
damn
cool

to

for
the
next

o
not
your
typical
english
pale

but
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
extremely
well
made
and
drinkable
overall
i
abandoned
expectations
heading
into
this
and
i
was
really
surprised
this
beer
is
delicious
given
all
of
the
labeling
as
well
as
being
able
to
see
suspended

i
went
with
about
as
gentle
a
pour
as
i
have
ever
employed
i
still
got
a
skim

that
quickly
became
mere

my

created
a

an
odd

mouthfeel
was
very
effervescent
and
it
did
indeed
taste
like
a
hybrid
of
a

a

finish
was
quite
dry
with
the

taste
simply
lingering
well
after

i
really
must
try

buy
yourself
more
than
one

of
this
very

a

easy

epa
perhaps
one
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
the
nelsonsauvin
hops
add
a
really
great
character
to
this
beer
well
worth
trying

the

than
the
disappointing

i
had
with
the
jaipur
a
real

nelson

o
oh
this
is
good
stuff
will
definitely
pick
more
up

i
love
the
deep
tropical
hop
character
this
beer
has
in
my
admittedly
limited
experience
this
might
be
the
best
ipa
ive
ever
tasted
this
is
a
very
tasty
hoppy
pale
ale
really
showcases
these
delicious
fruity
hops
well
a
bit
expensive
but
worth
it
as
a
treat
a
good
drinker
and
good
for
its
style
it
pours
lighter
yellow
with
a
lasting
white
soapy

mild

aroma
medium

carbonation
right
there
it
is
unique
in
a
soft

nice
coup
for
the
lcbo
getting
thornbridge
nice

backing
great
brew
ill
be
drinking
jaipur
and
kipling
all
summer
if
i
can
swing
it
a
great
display
of
these
wonderful
hops
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
30
2012
after
purchasing
from
the
king
and
spadina
lcbo
outlet
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazed
medium
gold
colour
with
a
1
snow
white
head
and
plenty
of
effervescence
the
aromas
were
grtass
citrusy
hops
spices
and
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
definitely
on
the
bitter
side
with
very
little
nsweetness
brought
on
by
any
of
the
malt
or
fruit
aromas
generous
amounts
of
orange
and
grapefruit
and
a
sharp
bitter
end
dominate
the
flavour
would
be
a
very
sessionable
beer
had
it
not
been
for
the
bitter
aftertaste
o
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
serving
up
a
solid
dose
of
citrus
hops
which
would
please
any
critics
definitely
worthy
of
grabbing
a
few
more
bottles
before
they
disappear
overall
very
nice
a
very
flavourful
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
almost
like
an
east
coast
pa
meets
an
west
coast
pa
it
actually
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
beer
i
get
locally
called
crazy
canuck
to
some
extent
the
high
price
tag
would
be
my
only
complaint
with
this
one
but
its
defiantly
worth
buying
at
least
once
pours
a
hazy
pale
blonde
colour
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
incredibly
hoppy
lots
of
tropical
and
citrus
fruits
going
on
orange
mango
grapefruit
a
slight
sweetness
with
some
malt
but
this
is
a
full
on
fruity
hop
nose
all
the
way
taste
is
dry
and
hoppy
followed
by
a
more
pronounced
malt
bill
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
with
some
tropical
fruit
flavours
coming
in
mid
palate
towards
the
finish
light
sweetness
in
finish
and
aftertaste
medium
crisp
carbonation
med
body
some
oily
points
and
quite
dry
feeling
this
was
a
very
impressive
pale
ale
very
easy
drinking
and
something
i
would
welcome
many
times
over
d
quite
a
good
pale
ale
that
id
pick
up
again
aroma
was
off
the
charts
and
the
taste
was
pretty
goshdarn
good
too
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
more
stinky
grassy
and
tropical
pale
ale
anywhere
including
southern
california
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
comes
from
jollyold
england
or
then
again
when
you
consider
just
how
approachable
and
balanced
sessionable
dare
i
say
thornbridge
kipling
is
perhaps
it
shouldnt
be
such
a
shock
a
fantastic
offering
bottle
poured
a
hazy
yellowish
color
ale
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
fruity
and
floral
hops
with
light
grassy
notes
is
very
enticing
taste
is
dominated
by
the
grassy
fruity
and
floral
notes
form
the
hops
with
almost
no
bitterness
notes
and
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
well
balanced
sweetness
that
doesnt
detract
from
the
hops
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
very
well
brewed
with
just
the
right
amount
of
nelson
sauvin
hops
to
procure
maximum
enjoyment
of
this
beer
i
like
this
a
lot
i
cant
help
hoping
itll
be
like
some
beer
version
of
skunk
after
getting
a
whiff
of
it
but
the
taste
belies
the
aroma
its
quite
a
soft
beer
despite
the
grapefruit
a
gentler
cousin
to
halcyon
and
jaipur
cheers
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
nice
clear
goldenyellow
pour
with
two
finger
pure
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
will
absolutely
blow
you
away
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
totally
steal
the
show
tons
of
that
distinctive
aroma
full
of
grapefruit
and
tropical
fruit
reminiscent
of
new
zealands
sauvignon
blanc
wines
the
taste
is
complex
and
also
dominated
by
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
earthy
herbal
and
citrusy
at
the
same
time
hints
of
grapefruit
gooseberries
lemon
white
grapes
pineapple
and
an
odd
touch
of
green
onion
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
resiny
with
a
light
crisp
and
refreshing
dry
finish
another
awesome
beer
from
thornbridge
good
solid
mouthfeel
slightly
lively
carbonation
makes
a
tasty
brew
o
as
someone
that
really
enjoys
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
a
good
offering
that
highlights
the
hop
this
beer
is
a
real
easy
drinker
and
has
a
very
nice
balance
to
it
taste
again
a
bit
of
grain
and
a
lot
of
tropical
fruit
but
the
flavours
do
not
come
off
as
fruity
and
certainly
not
sweet
the
tropical
fruits
of
the
aroma
are
present
in
the
flavour
but
are
accompanied
by
solid
bitterness
and
an
interesting
tarlike
note
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
well
balanced
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
result
in
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
i
might
be
grabbing
another
one
of
these
just
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
hop
i
cant
think
of
having
this
hop
before
and
id
like
to
have
it
again
a
unique
hybrid
of
a
relatively
old
beer
style
fused
with
a
relatively
new
varierty
of
hop
more
importanly
is
that
the
hybrid
works
im
be
looking
forward
towards
more
thornbridge
in
the
future
a
tasty
enjoyable
english
pale
ale
that
gives
a
serious
nod
towards
apas
id
reach
for
another
of
these
for
sure
and
love
the
names
homage
to
one
of
my
favourite
writers
well
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
do
a
damned
fine
job
of
furthering
the
terroir
of
new
zealand
so
many
strange
flavours
for
a
pale
ale
a
thought
stolen
from
old
world
white
wine
drinkers
at
some
point
i
would
imagine
a
little
intense
and
confounding
at
first
but
once
settled
in
i
rather
enjoyed
this
little
antipodean
experiment
taste
is
like
a
pale
ale
should
be
i
had
some
pumpkin
and
pineapple
in
the
taste
there
is
some
very
appealing
tropical
fruit
on
the
nose
a
much
fuller
body
than
the
bottled
version
which
to
be
honest
swamps
and
smothers
some
of
the
beers
more
appealing
and
delicate
qualities
but
as
compensation
the
force
of
the
body
pulls
the
flavour
around
the
mouth
giving
you
a
real
sense
of
a
full
long
massaging
bitterness
still
i
miss
that
lightness
of
touch
that
comes
from
the
bottle
i
am
afraid
to
say
overall
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
with
great
citrus
notes
balanced
well
with
the
bitter
finish
perfect
drinking
for
a
29
degree
london
afternoon
many
rave
about
jaipur
but
im
more
of
a
kipling
fan
this
ale
certainly
improved
as
it
breathed
as
it
released
a
lot
of
the
skunkiness
that
first
presented
in
the
smell
and
taste
the
bitterness
is
classic
thornbridge
in
fact
whichever
hop
was
used
to
create
the
bitterness
likely
is
the
same
one
used
in
their
jaipur
ipa
not
a
bad
english
pa
though
slightly
more
bitter
than
others
ive
had
something
that
works
for
me
still
of
the
jaipur
the
raven
and
the
kipling
the
kipling
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
bunch
flavor
is
firmly
bitter
plenty
of
grassy
lemony
hop
character
dried
citrus
peel
hay
some
vague
weediness
effervescent
and
medium
bodied
exceptionally
dry
and
crisp
finish
light
and
not
too
filling
nicely
drinkable
several
would
be
easy
to
drink
if
only
it
wasnt
9
for
a
small
glass
brilliant
golden
pour
on
tap
at
pipers
pub
in
pittsburghs
southside
its
a
pale
golden
ale
much
like
a
hazed
czech
or
german
pils
in
appearance
light
biscuit
malts
labeled
as
a
south
pacific
pale
ale
recently
showed
up
at
my
local
in
ohio
for
6
99
a
500
ml
bottle
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
passed
at
those
prices
im
pretty
sure
i
had
an
imperial
pint
for
at
or
around
5
bucks
at
pipers
aroma
has
a
citrus
grapefruit
esque
earthy
grassy
hop
profile
about
it
very
pleasant
floral
aspect
as
well
all
those
hops
amongst
a
pale
biscuit
malt
background
a
bit
of
fruity
earthiness
comes
through
from
the
yeast
and
english
brewing
traditions
flavor
was
nice
a
really
refreshing
hoppy
pale
ale
english
style
not
an
americanized
pale
not
as
aggressive
but
very
well
executed
and
flavors
definitely
blend
together
nicely
the
pale
biscuit
malt
sweetness
with
a
mild
fruitiness
is
the
perfect
back
drop
for
the
star
of
the
show
in
this
case
nelson
sauvin
hops
those
hops
bring
the
herbal
grassiness
with
a
nice
persistent
grapefruit
pith
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
lighter
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
really
crsip
nice
drinking
pale
ale
with
great
complexity
for
a
beer
so
light
in
color
overall
impression
is
that
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
attempt
to
drink
in
number
but
the
price
point
at
6
99
a
bottle
may
stop
me
from
drinking
it
indefinitely
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
could
easily
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
well
worth
a
shot
my
friend
had
a
500ml
bottle
of
this
and
split
it
with
me
into
pint
glasses
pours
a
bright
body
with
plenty
of
head
great
color
an
english
ipa
or
a
south
pacific
style
as
they
call
it
smell
has
the
slightly
more
subdued
hop
profile
characteristic
of
the
english
ipas
compared
to
the
huge
west
coast
ipas
very
clean
with
a
unique
hop
profile
taste
is
plenty
bitter
with
a
depth
of
malt
character
and
some
hop
varieties
that
i
have
not
tasted
before
or
at
least
not
in
this
particular
combination
really
solid
english
ipa
recommended
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
went
well
with
a
roast
pork
dinner
while
not
visibly
highly
carbonated
the
beer
has
a
biting
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
finishes
dry
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
m
a
surprisingly
quaffable
ale
light
but
hopped
to
a
tropical
tune
a
wide
array
of
citric
bitterness
sugary
sweet
at
times
dominates
the
ale
o
sadly
i
was
not
eating
any
food
alongside
this
beer
i
would
love
to
explore
its
abilities
to
pair
with
food
which
i
think
would
also
help
to
counteract
what
i
think
is
a
touch
too
much
bitterness
nelson
sauvin
is
fairly
high
in
alpha
acid
and
i
am
sure
that
theyll
tweak
the
next
batch
accordingly
from
what
i
am
reading
this
is
the
first
commercial
example
of
a
beer
brewed
with
this
hop
variety
so
im
sure
that
while
a
small
almost
infinitesimal
tweak
is
in
order
but
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
this
beer
and
i
think
that
anyone
who
doesnt
should
give
it
a
second
or
third
or
fourth
shot
poured
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retained
rather
well
throughout
light
grassy
floral
nose
light
taste
very
smooth
with
notes
of
grass
and
light
fruits
light
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
but
not
extremely
flavorful
md
the
mouthfeel
remains
refreshing
without
going
fizzy
the
body
is
medium
for
the
alc
level
and
the
flavour
profile
is
evolving
and
showing
a
very
very
decent
balance
ive
tried
this
wonderful
pale
ale
for
many
times
now
on
cask
and
this
bottled
version
really
doesnt
disappoint
at
all
a
delicious
thirstquencher
o
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
delve
into
i
drank
this
ontap
without
knowing
anything
about
it
aside
from
the
fact
that
its
english
then
i
saw
the
label
and
it
said
south
pacific
pale
ale
it
made
sense
if
theres
not
nelson
sauvin
hops
in
this
i
would
be
shocked
shocked
great
epa
like
nothing
ive
ever
had
before
d
very
flavorful
pale
ale
with
a
nice
hop
bite
im
surprised
a
cask
from
across
the
pond
traveled
so
well
o
very
solid
english
pale
ale
almost
ventures
into
ipa
category
had
this
with
a
hand
drawn
pump
the
appearance
was
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
with
a
slight
hazy
dull
straw
color
slight
white
head
and
low
carbonation
the
smell
was
a
little
bandaidy
and
funky
the
beer
had
a
slight
sulfur
aftertaste
almost
like
it
was
infected
but
another
person
in
my
group
said
they
thought
it
was
just
fine
i
dont
know
that
i
would
get
it
again
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
if
this
were
reasonably
priced
id
make
this
a
go
to
session
beer
overall
this
a
good
beer
which
showcases
this
amazing
hop
variety
to
a
tee
while
i
recommend
this
i
do
so
with
the
asterisk
because
it
is
overpriced
for
the
overall
productoffering
the
alpine
brewery
does
a
better
showcase
of
this
hop
with
their
brew
nelson
and
it
is
much
cheaper
and
comes
in
a
22
oz
compared
to
a
500
ml
still
good
though
d
excellent
and
very
very
drinkable
the
balance
and
selection
of
flavor
in
this
beer
is
perfect
for
the
style
and
it
is
a
shockingly
good
english
pale
ale
especially
considering
that
it
came
out
of
a
bottle
i
cant
think
of
a
beer
available
on
my
local
beer
stores
shelves
that
expresses
what
is
great
about
british
beer
better
than
this
does
it
has
a
perfect
yeast
character
with
the
obligatory
must
hop
bite
and
the
malt
is
spot
on
despite
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
unusually
light
colored
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
cant
stop
thinking
about
how
good
it
must
be
out
of
a
cask
one
of
my
local
pubs
has
this
on
permanently
since
they
bought
two
barrels
and
sold
them
both
within
3
hours
and
that
makes
me
happy
iam
really
diggin
the
thornbridge
stuff
i
gotta
say

temperature
really
opened
up
all
the
flavors
paired
with
wild
mushroom
brie
puff
pastry
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
from
the
place
where
it
originated
england
check
it
out
a
very
tasty
beer
flavoursome
and
distinctive
would
suit
a
hot
day
but
great
anytime
the
fruity
hops
are
unlike
anything
else
ive
tried
worth
seeking
out
to
sample
d
i
love
me
some
nelson
sauvin
hops
so
this
one
hit
the
spot
for
me
i
prefer
it
showcased
alongside
a
more
substantial
malt
backbone
though
good
overall
an
excellent
pale
ale
and
another
fine
brew
from
thornbridge
definitely
recommended
good
stuff
nice
and
smooth
and
even
with
a
5
2
abv
you
feel
like
you
could
spend
an
afternoon
drinking
these
just
about
perfectly
golden
with
a
soft
pillowy
white
head
with
very
good
retention
delightfully
aromatic
and
i
know
this
may
be
a
bit
taboo
on
a
beer
site
but
it
smells
an
awful
lot
like
a
cross
between
a
new
zealand
sauvignon
blanc
and
an
alsatian
gewürztraminer
gooseberry
abounds
plus
loads
of
coconut
and
lychee
and
even
some
rose
honeysuckle
and
marshmallow
are
in
the
mix
as
well
but
the
flavor
is
quite
contained
very
vinous
with
gooseberry
kiwi
fruit
and
honey
notes
crisp
and
perfectly
bitter
with
snappy
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
an
excellent
and
unusual
english
ale
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
cask
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
o
though
the
taste
may
be
ever
so
slightly
off
here
no
bottle
date
this
has
an
assertive
pleasantenough
english
hop
flavor
with
arguably
a
slight
edge
over
the
clean
yet
depthy
malt
foundation
youre
still
not
gonna
find
many
american
breweries
making
a
pale
like
this
o
good
beer
nice
to
kick
back
with
and
drink
with
the
folks
a
decent
session
pale
ale
as
expected
overall
pleasant
drink
not
particularly
overwhelming
and
complex
not
a
bad
thing
like
all
the
beers
from
shepherd
neame
medium
body
medium
low
carbonation
overall
this
ale
is
really
special
it
is
very
like
a
bridge
between
a
standard
ale
and
a
good
bitter
this
beer
pleases
excites
and
satisfies
in
equal
measures
i
can
best
describe
this
by
saying
it
is
a
great
ambassador
for
british
brewing
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
medium
off
white
head
aroma
and
taste
is
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
and
grains
mild
fruity
notes
and
light
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
crisp
body
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
toasted
caramel
malt
grains
and
a
mild
hops
bitterness
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
session
brew
this
bottles
too
cold
this
bottles
too
warm
there
isnt
one
in
my
hotel
room
thats
just
right
this
isnt
my
first
dance
with
spitfire
and
i
must
say
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
weak
not
what
i
like
in
kentish
ales
its
definitely
short
dated
sometimes
marked
on
the
bottle
neck
sometimes
not
this
is
not
up
to
the
usual
standards
of
shepherds
neame
typical
english
pub
beer
for
downing
a
few
good
but
not
great
brewed
originally
to
celebrate
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
britain
this
english
ale
is
a
standout
brew
that
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
quickly
the
taste
is
a
tad
hoppy
but
not
to
the
point
of
overpowering
with
plenty
of
bitterness
and
its
a
refreshing
and
pleasant
ale
that
goes
down
quickly
and
demands
a
second
sip
straight
away
the
beer
takes
its
name
from
the
famed
fighter
aircraft
that
fought
over
the
skies
of
britain
during
the
second
world
war
one
of
the
finest
english
beers
ive
tried
in
awhile
it
was
a
small
11
2fl
oz
bottle
so
i
thought
that
i
could
invert
it
until
the
pseudocascade
began
and
foam
began
approaching
the
top
of
my
glass
at
an
alarming
rate
it
settled
into
two
puffy
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
solid
amber
srm
13
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
soft
buttery
quality
undoubtedly
from
using
hard
water
in
its
production
biscuit
malts
were
also
present
and
i
watched
the
head
slowly
fall
leaving
some
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
as
i
anticipated
that
first
sip
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
flavor
was
bready
biscuity
buttery
and
slightly
sweet
i
am
guessing
east
kent
goldings
hops
for
a
mild
grassiness
in
keeping
with
the
style
this
was
much
more
restrained
than
its
american
counterparts
and
as
such
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
yours
truly
i
rarely
truck
in
either
imports
or
bottles
and
so
this
was
a
rare
treat
its
relative
mellowness
was
like
a
cup
of
tea
after
that
coffee
porter
warming
the
taste
took
on
a
nice
nuttiness
that
only
enhanced
its
mellow
flavors
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
refreshing
well
done
lads
this
is
quintessential
mass
produced
pale
ale
from
the
uk
low
carbonation
with
a
rich
body
this
beer
leans
to
the
malty
side
i
do
catch
a
modicum
of
hop
flavor
in
the
swallow
but
it
doesnt
last
long
overall
i
give
it
a
4
50
this
is
what
beer
should
look
like
awesome
appearance
with
a
deep
blood
orange
amber
color
that
begs
to
be
drank
moving
onto
the
flavor
its
exactly
what
i
would
expect
slight
caramel
flavor
marmalade
and
spice
it
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
this
is
one
of
the
few
british
beers
with
full
body
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
that
i
enjoyed
i
hope
to
see
more
of
this
beer
now
that
it
is
available
here
in
the
states
i
ordered
this
one
because
it
was
a
different
style
the
kentish
ale
this
was
really
hard
to
compare
to
any
other
english
style
ales
that
i
have
had
before
there
was
a
really
sweet
deep
malty
note
to
this
beer
but
a
solid
hop
not
on
the
back
end
really
unique
beer
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
lower
abv
i
enjoyed
this
with
my
fish
and
chips
at
british
beer
company
framingham
ma
o
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
several
other
choices
in
the
style
that
are
better
spunky
i
had
a
good
time
with
this
one
as
an
ace
reviewer
wrote
i
agree
its
only
befitting
that
a
beer
released
to
commemorate
the
battle
of
britain
brewed
by
britains
oldest
brewery
be
so
quintessentially
british
theres
no
mistaking
this
as
an
ale
from
any
other
part
of
the
world
its
hard
water
profile
biscuity
malts
dried
fruit
esters
spicy
hops
and
mild
approachable
manner
are
the
very
things
that
define
the
proud
english
brewing
tradition
overall
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
crisp
brew
while
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
it
is
quite
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
a
great
session
style
brew
overall
a
solid
dry
and
easy
to
drink
english
pale
ale
i
would
get
this
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
o
the
malt
hops
play
very
well
together
in
this
beer
and
give
the
drinker
a
good
example
of
an
english
ale
that
doesnt
allow
hop
characters
to
run
rampant
alos
terrific
in
its
sessionable
abv
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
ill
look
forward
to
buying
it
again
really
malty
and
of
high
bitterness
with
some
nice
red
fruit
tones
spitfire

a

overall
is
a
pretty

very

even
superior

good

with
an

if
you
like

the
tasting
notes
on

the
bottle
are
hilarious
overall
solid
english
ale
but
not
my
fave
worth
a
try
at
least
overall
not
my
favorite
but
still
good
and
glad
to
have
something
to
remind
me
of
good
memories
o
pleasant
beer
that
goes
down
easy
o
a
tasty
brew
but
surprisingly
mild
flavoured
ive
overlooked
this
on
the
shelf
before
and
although
it
wasnt
bad
i
wont
feel
bad
overlooking
it
again
o
a
lighter
version
of
the
english
pale
ale
i
rather
prefer
the
bishop
finger
from
the
same
brewery
but
spitfire
is
a
good
option
as
a
session
beer
thanks
to
billy
for
this
one
drinkability
is
high
a
nice
malt
flavor
countered
by
the
hops
in
a
balanced
restrained
package
just
try
not
to
sniff
too
much
good
classy
pale
ale
quite
on
the
dry
side
with
healthy
bit
of
hops
bitterness
not
remarkable
but
keeps
it
interesting
and
drinkable
o
absolutely
drinkable
perfect
session
beer
delicious
british
ale
food
match
roast
beef
steak
pies
and
cornish
pasties
all
spring
to
mind
but
really
for
a
style
like
epa
with
no
overpowering
flavours
its
quite
versatile
to
most
foods
overall
not
a
bad
example
but
not
a
great
one
need
more
malt
will
not
buy
again
overall
a
surprisingly
interesting
beer
that
would
be
great
for
a
session

it
probably
wont
be

the

ive
had

not

overall
this
is
a

o
a
clean
wellmade
and
traditional
english

despite
the
relatively
high

goes

has

a
b
grade
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
enough
flavour
to
keep
it
interesting
and
yet
not
too
cloying
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
throughout
the
course
of
an
evening
it
might
be
a
touch
too
expensive
for
what
you
get
however
could
have
sworn
this
was
better
even
when
it
was
released
as
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
but
sadly
those
days
are
long
lost
a
shame
such
a
lacklustre
beer
should
be
named
after
such
a
great
fighter
if
it
was
up
to
me
id
rebadge
it
boulton
paul
defiant
well
the
seethrough
bottle
had
me
feeling
a
wee
bit
trepidatious
but
that
was
soon
dispelled
this
is
a
wellbalanced
yet
still
decently
flavourful
epa
not
a
lot
of
that
makes
it
to
my
hood
sadly
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
thin
a
shame
because
everything
else
about
the
beer
is
fine
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
cans
and
i
am
very
happy
to
see
another
uk
canned
beer
in
bc
the
spitfire
is
a
fairly
malty
pale
ale
with
a
thickish
mouthfeel
that
holds
up
to
stronger
foods
such
as
burgers
with
blue
cheese
the
hops
are
decidely
english
in
profile
but
not
overtly
flowery
a
great
epa
for
when
the
nights
get
colder
and
with
the
can
it
tastes
fresh
just
beautiful
o
a
lovely
kentish
pale
ale
that
is
quite
delicious
and
has
a
character
to
its
own
o
this
one
ranks
among
the
best
epas
that
ive
tried
to
date
i
love
this
style
and
the
smooth
creamy
full
flavored
character
of
this
one
puts
it
right
up
there
with
the
best
in
my
opinion
perfectly
balanced
from
sweet
beginning
to
bitter
end
this
one
has
it
all
highly
recommended
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
very
nice
ale
thats
almost
impoosible
to
stop
at
just
one
pint
refreshing
on
a
summers
eve
a
classic
british
ale
it
might
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
a
fine
example
of
an
english
bitter
a
good
depth
of
flavour
with
subtle
bitterness
even
if
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
taste
one
of
shepherd
neames
more
worthy
offerings
i
would
be
happy
to
sink
a
few
of
these
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
have
the
chance
o
a
nice
malty
real
ale
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
an
all
round
clean
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
with
its
lower
end
abv
i
would
buy
this
again
d
a
decent
english
pale
ale
with
a
distinctly
bitter
hoppy
flavour
i
find
it
skews
the
balance
and
makes
the
beer
more
finish
than
flavour
but
its
certainly
worth
trying
for
yourself
to
see
whether
the
tanginess
suits
your
tastes
while
the
body
and
carbonation
of
this
spitfire
ale
are
pretty
much
on
point
the
harsh
feeling
and
flavors
that
i
find
make
the
drinking
experience
generally
unpleasant
unfortunate
because
i
was
really
excited
after
the
aroma
and
appearance
were
so
damn
good
taste
was
quite
good
with
a
strong
finish
felt
very
good
in
the
mouth
not
watery
a
well
balanced
brew
straight
and
no
fuss
deep
orange
in
colour
with
a
persistent
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
vaguely
hoppy
and
complex
with
fruit
and
a
tinge
of
mustiness
and
white
pepper
there
is
a
waft
of
orange
peel
somewhere
back
there
just
poking
its
nose
through
flavour
is
heavy
on
diacetyl
butterscotch
with
a
pleasant
mineral
bitterness
on
the
finish
pretty
good
session
beer
perhaps
not
one
of
the
more
outstanding
specialist
beers
but
for
a
readily
available
session
beer
this
is
hard
to
beat
good
characteristic
flavour
good
level
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
smell
combine
well
d
the
smell
is
easily
the
beer
thing
about
this
beer
it
has
some
nice
characteristics
but
all
in
all
its
a
bit
weak
generally
i
cant
really
see
any
reason
to
drink
this
again
the
more
i
drink
the
less
i
like
the
sourness
dr
a
damned
disappointment
especially
coming
from
shepherd
neame
a
brewery
ive
enjoyed
in
the
past
what
happened
despite
a
fairly
low
abv
i
doubt
id
want
more
than
on
or
two
on
any
given
day
it
is
very
satisfying
though
would
be
great
as
a
fillmeup
with
a
light
meal
overall
a
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
ale
top
notch
mouthfeel
is
good
although
the
beer
is
slightly
watery
this
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
however
as
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
at
the
pub
all
night
long
hence
the
high
score
on
drinkability
its
worth
trying
to
find
this
one
at
your
local
beer
store
i
had
this
on
cask
in
england
a
year
ago
and
i
seem
to
remember
liking
this
picked
up
a
bottle
today
to
try
it
again
pours
a
copperorange
colour
with
nice
white
head
nice
head
retention
with
lacing
over
some
of
the
glass
smells
of
bread
and
caramel
malt
some
earthy
hops
and
a
weird
metallic
smell
flavour
is
pretty
sweet
with
the
metal
being
in
the
aftertaste
good
carbonation
level
this
would
be
a
lot
nicer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
off
flavour
but
it
still
is
fine
good
hop
and
breadnotes
this
mabey
is
not
the
best
what
the
uk
has
to
offer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
decent
beer
d
not
the
best
from
this
brewery
and
gunned
down
by
the
bishops
finger
dark
and
cloudy
color
with
very
little
carbonation
more
like
bubbles
from
the
hand
pulling
very
malty
aroma
and
a
very
malty
flavor
this
beer
is
somewhat
unbalanced
and
not
the
most
refreshing
beverage
i
had
but
definitely
worth
getting
it
goes
great
with
fish
and
chips
and
just
before
a
long
nap
cask
this
one
pours
a
clear
slightly
darker
amber
color
there
was
1
finger
of
an
off
white
head
the
nose
is
nice
there
are
malts
as
well
as
some
biscuity
and
toasty
notes
maybe
some
floral
note
also
the
taste
is
very
good
this
one
has
a
nice
malt
body
toasty
biscuity
just
a
bit
bitter
a
very
nice
ale
like
a
lot
of
british
pale
ales
the
flavor
is
not
bold
or
aggressive
but
unlike
many
others
it
didnt
seem
weak
or
watery
just
subtle
and
understated
very
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
how
you
can
brew
a
delicious
flavorful
nuanced
beer
with
a
lower
abv
percentage
a
great
pick
for
an
evening
at
the
pub
an
enjoyable
and
sessionable
english
ale
wish
i
could
find
this
one
locally
d
smooth
and
refreshing
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
night
a
quality
brew
that
is
typical
of
the
style
but
the
midrange
is
just
a
shade
too
thin
this
did
not
do
it
for
me
nothing
bad
by
any
means
just
a
little
odd
worth
one
try
if
you
see
it
on
cask
though
i
think
there
are
better
options
on
cask
i
reviewed
anyway
because
if
the
beer
is
skunked
its
because
of
the
bottle
punk
ipa
also
had
similar
earthy
hops
but
was
sooo
much
better
than
this
and
cheaper
dprobably
the
hoppiest
beer
ive
had
for
awhile
living
over
here
it
was
a
welcome
change
of
pace
and
if
i
can
remember
where
i
bought
this
ill
get
more
overall
its
a
drinkable
brew
with
some
interesting
sweet
notes
about
it
not
too
shabby
a
smooth
sessionable
beer
with
only
the
smell
as
a
real
draw
back
notes
better
session
beers
are
available
but
it
isnt
bad
a
little
light
good
balance
between
malt
and
english
hops
d
quite
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
low
abv
even
not
a
bad
little
english
ale
almost
leaning
towards
the
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
not
nearly
as
complex
as
the
nose
indicates
but
still
highly
drinkable
would
be
good
for
a
football
watching
night
that
incredible
smell
didnt
translate
into
an
overly
hoppy
brew
taste
but
lordy
it
was
still
a
great
experience
and
something
i
will
be
buying
again
mk
d
i
did
not
feel
the
flavours
were
well
developed
here
its
not
that
hard
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
as
for
drinkability
its
right
on
the
cusp
you
know
if
it
could
just
get
over
the
hump
in
a
few
areas
itd
be
a
great
beer
as
it
stands
its
a
good
beer
worth
trying
id
try
one
in
a
pub
or
maybe
in
a
bottle
again
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
at
the
pub
when
youre
just
talking
to
the
boys
one
of
these
is
nice
but
then
i
like
to
have
something
else
mouthfeel
smooth
and
refreshing
slightly
creamy
and
no
coursness
a
good
medium
level
of
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
all
that
impressive
there
are
more
interesting
choices
out
there
though
this
one
is
certainly
worth
a
whirl
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
in
my
view
this
one
needs
a
bit
of
a
kick
in
the
arse
to
get
it
moving
malts
were
well
balanced
with
a
faint
citrus
ester
and
nice
kentish
hops
its
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
but
theres
enough
flavour
to
carry
it
to
the
end
if
it
werent
so
bloody
expensive
in
oz
id
drink
this
all
the
time
drinkability
had
this
by
itself
so
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
some
of
the
other
beers
but
with
dinner
it
might
improve
the
drinkability
overall
a
decent
drink
just
not
my
favorite
especially
for
an
english
ale
nice
for
something
new
though
drinkability
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
too
old
which
seems
a
bit
silly
considering
that
this
is
a
kentish
ale
but
otherwise
this
is
very
nearly
a
worldclass
ale
good
showcase
of
british
hopping
but
not
balanced
enough
and
too
fizzy
to
be
an
easy
drinker
palate
harsh
bitterness
low
carbonation
long
lasting
pungent
bitterness
medium
low
body
smooth
dry
mouthfeel
nice
and
carbonated
exceptionally
drinkable
a
very
good
drop
on
cask
at
the
speaker
in
london
i
had
a
half
pint
with
the
lunch
crowd
and
a
bad
of
pork
shavings
it
appeared
clear
orange
filled
to
the
brim
the
ale
has
a
big
nutty
walnuts
and
cashews
along
with
sugar
cookies
and
digestive
biscuits
a
bitter
british
hops
aftertaste
with
dry
toast
finish
close
out
this
tasty
beer
final
thoughts
i
though
after
seeing
this
beer
pour
this
was
going
to
be
a
winner
however
as
the
skunk
took
over
and
the
carbonation
leaved
me
belching
every
couple
of
minutes
i
was
disappointed
i
dunno
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
unless
they
really
enjoyed
a
dry
taste
ddespite
the
initial
high
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bitter
not
the
best
out
there
but
definitely
very
decent
drinkability
this
is
very
flavourful
i
wouldnt
pound
too
many
back
in
a
row
it
would
trivialize
it
overall
lovely
beer
light
and
refreshing
balanced
not
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
but
still
great
high
drinkability
pours
a
nice
coppery
honey
brown
i
got
a
one
finger
white
chunky
head
that
doesnt
last
all
that
long
coppery
like
smell
with
notes
of
caramel
decent
carbonation
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
the
bitterness
is
well
balanced
and
isnt
overwhelming
making
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
too
sure
if
i
would
buy
another
this
isnt
undercarbonated
but
the
bubbles
feel
miniscule
on
my
tongue
giving
an
initial
watery
feel
this
is
a
nicely
savoury
beer
with
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
being
curbed
by
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
leaving
a
rather
earthy
maybe
even
slightly
nutty
flavour
well
coordinated
but
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
certainly
it
would
be
a
doddle
to
knock
back
a
bunch
of
these
it
isnt
particularly
substantial
or
in
any
way
offensive
d
all
night
quite
a
light
brew
has
some
slight
dryness
and
bitterness
to
it
a
decent
drinker
alright
if
you
can
pick
it
up
around
6
bucks
a
bottle
but
not
worth
too
much
more
sessionable
and
tasty
good
drinkability
very
dark
copper
pour
with
a
decent
one
finger
thick
foam
top
smells
primarily
of
malts
with
some
herbal
and
floral
hops
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
taste
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
light
sweetness
with
some
caramel
candy
and
toffee
balanced
very
well
with
a
dry
grassy
hop
quality
finishes
a
bit
too
herbal
for
sadly
almost
seemed
mediciney
somewhat
dry
with
a
medium
body
overall
a
decent
beer
comes
in
a
squat
clear
bottle
that
shows
off
the
coppery
amber
hue
upon
opening
it
is
phenomenally
carbonated
which
i
thinks
rather
impedes
the
mouthfeel
apart
from
that
there
is
good
flavor
and
body
a
really
quite
dry
bitter
with
considerable
hop
aroma
would
be
nice
to
contrast
this
with
a
very
fresh
sample
bottled
in
amber
glass
im
still
going
to
drink
and
more
or
less
enjoy
this
but
its
deficiencies
are
quite
obvious
and
take
alot
away
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
brew
overall
the
malts
and
hops
are
wellbalanced
although
the
alcohol
is
average
4
5
i
felt
that
i
was
drinking
a
stronger
beer
i
could
have
appreciated
spitfire
more
if
not
for
the
very
tart
aftertaste
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amberred
with
a
decent
frothy
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
pretty
heavy
on
the
sweet
maltscaramel
side
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
taste
is
nothing
special
but
pretty
smooth
the
sweeter
maltier
side
is
a
lot
more
subdued
than
the
smell
indicated
so
light
hops
and
light
malts
are
what
you
get
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
and
overall
this
is
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
and
pretty
refreshing
but
it
is
ultimately
nothing
special
and
a
little
disappointing
compared
to
other
english
ales
that
can
be
easily
purchased
a
decent
if
not
extraordinary
ale
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
drinkable
enough
without
being
outstanding
review
translated
from
french
6172008
the
taste
is
lightly
skunky
but
not
as
noticeable
as
the
nose
has
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
not
something
i
would
get
again
unless
the
bottles
were
changed
to
brown
or
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
on
cask
the
lcbo
better
not
discontinue
this
one
try
this
beer
a
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
a
surprisingly
stubborn
beer
considering
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
common
english
ales
available
in
swedish
pubs
one
of
my
favourites
overall
i
like
it
if
i
can
find
it
again
then
i
will
drink
it
again
pours
a
clear
copper
with
an
inch
thick
head
a
bit
metallic
smelling
with
a
solid
malty
presence
and
hint
of
lemon
and
leafiness
taste
is
on
the
assertive
side
definite
lemon
tones
and
tartness
bitterness
follows
but
is
a
bit
onedimensional
seems
a
little
unbalanced
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
high
as
well
overall
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
quite
aggressive
epa
lots
of
flavour
and
carbonated
bite
but
lacks
some
sublety
and
balanced
id
say
for
certain
that
this
is
my
favourite
of
the
shepherd
neame
range
d
good
easy
drinking
and
tasty
if
this
was
my
local
pint
i
would
be
more
than
happy
a
tasty
british
pale
ale
i
tend
to
find
most
of
the
british
pales
i
try
to
be
subtle
and
extremely
drinkable
this
one
was
the
same
had
an
almost
tea
like
quality
to
it
this
is
certainly
a
beer
that
you
could
have
a
session
with
enjoyable
simple
pleasure
d
very
good
drinkability
one
of
my
managers
brought
this
back
from
england
on
the
plane
the
freshness
difference
is
amazing
in
these
english
pas
if
i
could
get
this
as
fresh
every
time
i
would
drink
this
on
a
fairly
regular
basis
the
spitfire
kentish
ale
pours
a
muted
gold
into
the
pint
glass
solid
2finger
off
white
head
caps
the
brew
the
aroma
is
very
floralherbal
with
a
mild
spicy
undernote
toffeeish
malt
and
biscuits
initialy
on
the
palate
the
solid
bitterness
grips
and
follows
through
to
the
finish
with
some
nice
tree
fruit
flavours
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
though
maybe
a
touch
spritzy
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
bitter
big
thanks
to
mike
for
lugging
this
one
back
for
me
md
overly
fizzy
on
the
mouthfeel
and
shows
no
sign
of
softening
after
quite
many
sips
making
the
drink
slightly
too
stimulating
for
the
relatively
mild
flavour
and
a
surprisingly
light
body
the
nose
of
this
bottled
version
is
perhaps
clearer
and
more
aromatic
than
the
cask
verion
but
the
flavour
and
structure
is
way
below
supposed
performance
ill
rather
stick
to
the
casked
spitfire
in
the
future
great
pub
by
the
way
originally
produced
in
1990
to
commemorate
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
britain
spitfire
is
a
spunky
little
english
pale
ale
with
loads
of
personality
and
an
abundance
of
classic
epa
flavor
i
had
a
good
time
with
this
one
very
good
beer
i
got
this
by
mailorder
since
it
hasnt
been
seen
in
texas
since
the
mid90s
wish
theyd
bring
it
back
here
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
tiny
head
smell
is
weak
but
definitely
has
lots
of
nuts
in
it
like
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
aggressively
nutty
like
a
nut
brown
but
a
small
hint
of
citrus
in
the
finish
quite
refreshing
and
pleasant
much
more
of
a
craft
beer
than
i
would
have
expected
from
this
brewery
water
is
also
pretty
evident
in
it
but
it
helps
with
the
ease
and
makes
it
go
down
without
a
problem
aggressive
carbonation
and
lots
of
hops
and
dry
bitterness
brown
but
big
hop
bubbles
are
nice
my
son
liked
it
it
was
ok
for
lunch
but
only
a
soso
some
citrus
a
little
carmel
and
malt
nuttiness
and
grainiess
metallic
on
mid
sip
medium
mouthfeel
taste
very
hoppy
actually
i
was
quite
surprised
of
this
hoppy
taste
as
i
smelled
none
a
tiny
finish
of
malt
is
present
but
i
find
her
taste
to
be
rude
actually
not
very
polished
reminds
me
of
a
raw
beer
agressive
taste
of
hops
followed
by
malt
then
nothing
nothing
to
balance
and
finish
this
beer

unexpectedly
bitter

good
traditional
english
ale
a
solid

is
high
nice
beer
recommended
very
distinctive

not
a
bad
ale
but
not
enough
hops
to
appeal
to
me
pours

persistent

enjoyable
some
caramely

carbonated

the
style
but
settles
a
bit
after
a
few
minutes
body
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
dry
all
in
all
a
pretty
decent
pale

im
sure
its
much
better
on
cask
than
in

light
syrupy

provisional
proteinrich

remind
me
of
rye
crisp
crackers
i
think
thats
a
scandinavian
genre
right
rye
crackers
i
rate
this
as
one
of
the
better
ales
i
tried
without
being
a
standout
cut
above
the
rest
my
memory
of
spitfire
is
two
years
old
so
forgive
me
if
it
has
managed
to
improve
in
my
mind
had
this
on
tap
in
a
pub
in
peckham
in
southeast
london
this
was
the
only
place
i
saw
this
as
i
usually
encountered
speckled
hen
in
most
of
the
pubs
i
was
able
to
frequent
i
ordered
it
because
i
thought
spitfire
was
a
superb
name
for
an
english
beer
and
therefore
had
to
try
it
was
a
reddish
amber
color
if
memory
serves
with
a
nice
compact
white
head
perched
on
top
smelt
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
taste
started
with
a
malty
sweetness
that
was
subtle
not
dominating
with
the
bulk
of
the
taste
created
by
the
hops
which
gave
a
satisfying
citrusy
zip
to
the
taste
buds
i
really
like
english
bitters
and
this
one
went
very
well
with
my
bacon
stilton
hamburger
and
chips
serving
12
oz
bottle
after
some
pretty
bad
russian
brews
tonight
this
is
a
fine
way
indeed
to
remind
myself
of
why
i
like
beer
a
bloody
jolly
good
show
from
those
kentish
chaps

more
than
onei
will
be
looking
for
more
ales
from
this
brewery
for
sure
i
also
had
this
one
a
the
wilton
arms
pub
in
westminster
while
i
was
recently
on
vacation
there
this
is
truly
and
excellant
brew
it
poured
and
was
deep
brown
with
some
ruby
color
also
it
had
a
rich
and
creamy
thick
head
it
smelled
of
flowery
almost
fruity
hops
it
was
delicious
to
the
taste
it
was
moderately
complex
and
very
flavorful
it
was
slightly
fruity
and
had
another
flavor
that
i
just
couldnt
quite
figure
out
it
was
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
if
i
ever
encounter
this
brew
again
i
will
not
hesitate
to
drink
it
and
hopefully
purchase
it
cool
bottle
i
like
the
color
it
is
when
it
pours
out
a
golden
caramel
color
with
a
light
colored
head
to
it
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
too
much
but
when
it
is
around
it
is
nice
there
is
some
settlement
on
the
bottom
of
the
beer
looks
like
syrup
or
something
anyways
has
a
nice
refreshing
taste
to
it
and
doesnt
dissappoint
nearly
carmelyruby
pour
with
minimal
head
smell
is
rather
pleasant
but
also
somewhat
meeka
straightforward
blend
of
hops
and
malt
taste
is
heavier
than
expected
a
bit
syrupy
though
not
unpleasantly
sweet
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
usual
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
the
flavor
profile
not
changing
much
between
start
and
finish
the
more
i
drink
the
more
the
mediumbodied
malts
seem
to
come
through
i
e
this
one
improved
as
the
glass
emptied
syrupy
texture
detracted
from
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
but
this
is
acceptably
drinkable
hoppy
sticky
slightly
syruppy
and
bland
in
the
end
its
ok
but
lacked
something
nice
and
drinkable
though
give
it
a
go
i
found
this
to
be
a
somewhat
lighter
version
of
bishops
finger
kentish
ale
this
by
no
means
is
a
detrement
this
is
a
classic
english
ale
the
spitfire
i
had
was
in
a
british
pub
cask
conditioned
appearance
wise
it
might
be
the
most
beautiful
ale
a
dark
clear
ruby
color
fruity
tast
with
solid
malt
backbone
subtle
hopping
as
with
all
cask
conditioned
brews
it
has
a
mellow
smoothness
and
high
drinkability
there
is
nothing
like
cask
or
real
ale
notes
a
classic
pale
ale
and
now
affordable
most
of
shepherd
neames
brews
have
dropped
in
price
in
order
to
compete
with
the
wide
varieties
of
u
s
beers
one
would
assume
by
far
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
great
look
out
of
the
bottle
amber
hue
although
not
much
of
a
head
or
lacing
the
smell
was
just
superb
not
your
runofthemill
pale
ale
scent
mouthfeel
was
okay
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
speaking
of
the
taste
it
was
great
hints
of
fruitiness
to
go
mix
quite
well
with
the
bitterness
of
the
ale
overall
i
consider
this
the
best
shipyard
offering
ive
had
to
date
copper
color
nice
dryish
malt
with
some
bread
and
caramel
not
hoppy
very
nice
epa
best
by
date
was
still
5
months
out
but
this
tasted
dreadful
malty
stale
bread
o
eh
not
again
but
worth
trying
poured
into
tapered
pint
glass
poured
about
an
inch
head
with
a
pretty
amber
color
it
has
a
super
sweet
smell
with
burnt
sugar
and
malty
caramel
notes
it
has
a
strong
malty
bread
notes
upfront
with
a
piney
hoppy
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nothing
special
not
a
lot
going
on
but
solid
overall
very
good
beer
with
good
toasty
malty
slightly
sweet
slightly
bitter
flavors
im
very
glad
to
see
that
a
beer
named
for
one
of
my
favorite
historical
american
heroes
also
tastes
good
ill
certainly
get
it
again
overall
it
was
a
good
pale
ale
worth
picking
up
but
not
sure
i
would
pay
2
50
for
the
single
again
o
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
i
probably
wont
be
acquiring
it
again
caramel
and
amber
malt
complimented
by
english
bakers
yeast
some
hope
presence
but
not
much
o
good
stuff
if
you
are
a
fan
of
crisp
pale
ales
this
is
a
great
beer
very
refreshing
after
a
warm
day
full
of
household
activities
that
is
a
tasty
english
pale
ale
very
english
if
you
like
the
style
you
will
definitely
like
this
if
not
stay
away
i
did
like
its
dryness
and
nonsweet
profile
forces
you
to
compulsively
want
more
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
smellquite
british
earthy
with
dry
caramel
with
a
good
dollop
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
swallow
relatively
short
aftertaste
spritzy
body
round
body
english
pales
arent
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
balanced
easygoing
beer
it
actually
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
drier
slightly
less
sweet
boston
lager
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
grabbing
it
again
but
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
either
o
a
fine
english
style
ale
which
is
to
say
for
me
a
very
fine
brew
indeed
its
clear
many
if
not
most
of
us
americans
tend
not
to
favor
this
style
when
its
good
i
love
it
although
admittedly
it
is
not
necessarily
the
most
refreshing
summer
brew
a
nice
easy
drinking
english
style
pale
ale
pours
mostly
clear
a
bland
bronze
color
with
an
inch
or
so
of
just
off
white
foam
the
nose
is
dry
english
biscuity
malt
very
little
sweetness
which
is
key
here
balanced
by
bittering
hops
only
this
is
a
bready
beer
malt
forward
and
quite
crisp
for
its
seeming
lack
of
any
hop
intensity
its
got
a
robust
malt
profile
but
retains
a
lighter
body
which
is
not
easily
achieved
and
highly
appreciated
here
excellent
carbonation
also
keeps
this
beer
feeling
light
as
does
its
relatively
lower
abv
compared
to
american
styled
pales
the
finish
is
as
crisp
as
any
lager
out
there
clean
and
quick
refreshing
and
sessionable
i
enjoy
all
the
malt
flavor
without
all
the
weight
and
sweetness
i
thought
this
was
a
very
well
made
beer
the
perfect
partner
to
some
spicy
garlic
citrus
chicken
wings
bottle
after
bottle
ahhhh
overall
good
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
one
o
it
may
be
a
slightly
off
6pack
but
the
diacetyl
and
slight
metallic
flavor
of
this
beer
left
me
disappointed
a
friend
called
it
an
insipid
apa
but
i
think
that
may
be
a
bit
harsh
still
i
dont
know
if
ill
give
it
a
2nd
chance
to
make
a
better
impression
overall
this
one
doesnt
taste
good
or
bad
its
just
a
beer
for
which
no
part
is
memorable
i
am
not
even
sure
how
drinkable
it
really
is
as
the
hops
and
aroma
are
all
very
dull
and
dry
definitley
too
sour
for
my
liking
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
beautiful
clear
orange
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
leaves
webs
of
lacing
behind
smell
biscuit
carmel
citrus
and
there
signature
ring
wood
yeast
taste
is
similar
all
those
flavors
and
the
yeast
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
very
lively
a
dry
finish
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
strawamber
color
but
with
very
little
head
smells
of
earthy
and
piney
hops
and
slight
malt
tastes
of
earthy
tones
with
the
hops
and
slight
malt
lightmedium
bodied
beer
goes
down
great
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
this
one
was
made
to
be
poured
from
a
cask
delicious
nose
and
great
overall
taste
balance
was
excellent
the
shipyard
knows
how
to
do
cask
beer
from
a
long
time
ago
i
think
it
was
the
highlight
of
the
the
cask
featival
at
the
bulls
head
1315
april
cheers
overall
didnt
want
to
finish
this
one
we
beer
aficiandos
drink
for
taste
and
this
is
where
this
beer
fails
only
serious
pale
ale
fans
should
try
others
avoid
o
dear
good
what
an
unpleasant
beer
i
hope
this
was
a
bad
old
batch
the
seasonal
sold
in
the
case
was
a
summer
ale
after
this
case
though
i
am
never
buying
another
shipyard
beer
again
every
beer
has
been
mediocre
at
best
or
highly
flawed
o
this
is
decent
for
its
style
and
decent
for
me
i
think
it
is
english
yes
english
the
low
hop
profile
plus
the
excessive
diacetyl
tells
me
so
o
easily
one
of
my
favorite
shipyard
brews
highly
recommend
for
a
tasty
inexpensive
pale
o
just
an
average
apa
that
somewhat
drinkable
i
would
recommend
it
o
pale
ales
are
a
hard
catagory
to
compete
in
and
unfortunately
this
one
does
not
measure
up
the
odd
bitterness
taste
and
the
off
aftertaste
make
this
an
interesting
but
not
great
beer
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
frosty
mug
in
sugarloaf
a
is
clean
with
rich
two
finger
head
slight
reddish
hue
s
is
friendly
sweet
and
smooth
peaches
faint
but
really
nice
t
is
a
wonderful
well
rounded
pale
with
a
simcoe
touch
biscuit
finish
with
good
malt
bill
m
is
well
carbonated
and
light
for
summer
o
is
a
really
smooth
pale
that
i
enjoyed
nicely
done
a
face
of
shipyard
brews
weird
little
beer
here
people
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
very
much
impressed
with
the
red
orange
color
along
with
a
1
finger
or
so
bright
white
head
that
there
is
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
that
was
even
impressive
it
tasted
like
a
light
version
of
a
light
beer
and
it
seemed
to
water
down
rather
quickly
very
bitter
and
strong
even
with
a
abv
just
below
5
not
my
style
this
will
be
a
beer
i
will
make
a
regular
in
my
fridge
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
this
beer
but
i
also
wouldnt
avoid
it
if
there
wasnt
a
better
choice
the
aroma
was
very
earthy
and
malty
not
the
usually
hoppy
pale
ale
i
come
across
lots
of
bready
malts
and
hints
of
light
grain
light
hops
as
it
warms
mostly
piney
the
flavor
carried
over
quite
well
rich
bready
malts
hints
of
biscuit
liek
flavors
and
a
light
touch
of
pine
hops
nothign
really
standing
out
to
me
though
and
the
whole
thing
comes
across
slightly
average
decent
medium
mouthfeel
here
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
overall
profile
this
is
a
really
delicious
pale
ale
and
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
in
portland
maine
had
it
from
a
bottle
pours
a
nice
dark
gold
color
smell
is
very
average
for
this
style
with
a
nice
malty
touch
to
it
pretty
average
apa
interestingly
those
i
am
getting
a
lot
of
buttery
diacetyl
type
flavors
with
shipyards
brews
must
be
their
signature
taste
is
very
malt
forward
and
the
hops
make
their
presence
followed
that
buttery
finish
refreshing
but
nothing
spectacular
a
rather
light
but
refreshing
beer
poured
a
light
amber
like
a
southern
ice
tea
small
head
stayed
a
long
time
even
to
the
end
nice
lace
smells
of
malt
sweet
taste
of
citrus
and
malt
well
balanced
lighter
than
expected
an
excellent
well
balanced
beer
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
i
will
keep
some
on
hand
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
it
in
my
area
but
i
will
ask
some
stores
to
stock
it
yup
the
butter
is
there
yuck
i
hate
that
stuff
for
an
apa
i
just
cant
justify
it
its
caramel
sweetness
is
tainted
by
it
the
hops
just
dont
live
that
long
perhaps
im
overly
sensitive
to
diacetyl
if
thats
what
this
is
blah
its
not
all
that
powerful
which
allowed
me
to
finish
the
beer
but
it
takes
a
severe
hit
to
taste
rating
while
its
not
a
reference
pale
ale
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
experience
given
the
right
circumstances
i
think
its
worth
another
bomber
bottle
in
my
cellar
pours
medium
amber
with
light
layer
of
white
sticky
foam
good
retention
light
malty
smell
taste
is
a
flavorful
malt
backed
by
a
modest
hop
for
the
close
notes
of
something
34s
of
the
way
through
pepper
maybe
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
nice
pale
not
as
powerfully
hoppy
as
most
americans
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
never
hash
and
is
nice
in
the
mouth
d
average
thirst
quenching
enjoyable
deasy
to
drink
but
not
a
beer
you
really
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
lacks
a
unique
taste
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
taste
is
also
hop
heavy
not
much
else
coming
through
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
unspectacular
brew
overall
a
good
apa
d
decent
beer
but
i
like
my
pas
with
a
little
hop
character
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
overall
if
magic
hats
blind
faith
had
this
mouthfeel
or
if
this
tasted
good
i
would
buy
either
of
them
again
as
is
though
not
going
to
happen
i
now
officially
give
up
completely
on
shipyard
shipyard
chamberlain
pale
ale
was
copper
colored
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
faded
into
obscurity
the
aroma
was
largely
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
a
weak
caramel
malt
in
the
flavor
lead
with
small
hops
acting
as
second
banana
supporting
cast
of
butter
chamberlain
doesnt
make
a
strong
statement
in
either
direction
malt
or
hops
nothing
here
to
write
home
about
the
mouth
feel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
oily
and
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
was
only
soso
just
not
good
enough
to
worry
about
having
another
one
a
nice
beer
for
sessioning
but
a
little
too
thin
for
my
tastes
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
with
some
pale
hop
flavors
but
still
too
light
overall
d
ok
drinkability
if
the
mouthfeel
was
cleaned
up
a
bit
it
would
be
a
lot
better
22oz

into
a
shaker
pint
tight
two
finger
white
head
dies
to
about
half
of
a
finger
and
the
constant
carbonation
keeps
it
there
over
a

body
a
light
bright

nose
a

herbal
hopiness
to
it
though
not

much

mouthfeel
is

with
good
carbonation
a
creamy
feel
to
it
overall
not
a
bad
pale
not
my
go
to
by
any
means
but
i
would
drink
it
if
presented
to
me
an
acceptable
apa
but
not
really
that
exciting
copper
looking
beer
very
clear
with
a
thin
head
simple
beer
on
the
aroma
typical
pale
ale
smell
malts
and
hops
however
very
little
intensity
the
taste
is
earthy
probably
from
the
hops
a
good
beer
to
drink
during
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
out
of
this
world
tho
d
a
well
crafted
pa
true
to
form
id
drink
another
it
was
somewhat
heavy
and
felt
pretty
thick
but
it
was
a
great
session
beer
very
enjoyable
with
dinner
poured
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
diminished
to
hardly
anything
at
all
body
was
mostly
clear
and
sparkling
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
beautiful
darkorange
color
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
wasnt
anything
special
lightly
hoppy
nice
on
the
palate
with
a
light
to
medium
body
slightly
oily
and
lively
carbonation
very
nice
flavor
that
starts
off
bitter
and
acidic
and
finishes
off
bitter
of
course
but
heavier
hops
than
would
have
been
expected
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
that
i
would
easily
drink
again
d
very
drinkable
and
nothing
to
overpowering
good
and
average
bitter
and
dry
at
the
finishe
thiner
side
for
sure
for
body
but
it
leads
into
drinkability
this
was
from
a
bomber
and
i
had
no
trouble
downing
this
if
you
are
into
extreme
beers
with
over
the
top
flavors
then
avoid
this
one
but
if
you
are
looking
for
an
easy
drinker
or
a
good
bbq
brew
this
might
just
be
it
i
am
not
a
shipyard
fan
but
this
became
the
second
brew
from
them
that
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
d
decent
pale
ale
really
fills
the
mouth
i
would
drink
this
again
i
couldve
sworn
that
concord
brewery
made
this
but
then
again
maybe
its
the
union
forces
civil
war
outfits
that
confused
me
this
special
ale
is
a
refreshing
simple
pale
ale
that
doesnt
try
anything
funny
or
special
simple
upfront
a
nice
golden
pour
to
coppery
brown
yelloe
with
thinnish
head
but
nice
lace
nice
mild
florals
mild
but
flavorful
malt
up
front
that
leads
to
a
good
clean
crisp
hop
bite
easy
to
drink
and
not
think
about
froma
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
aug

expiration
date
sampled
on
march

2009
it
pours
a
nice
looking
copperorange
with
good
carbonation
and
decent
clarity
the
aroma
is
a
kind
of
caramel
malt
with
a
feint
hop
distinction
taste
is
about
the
same
but
ends
bitter
like
an
esb
kind
of
nice
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
some
retentionand
decnt
laceing
aroma
is
buttery
with
fruity
hop
notes
as
well
body
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
bready
up
front
fruity
as
well
piney
hops
in
the
finish
i
like
it
a
lot
off
the
tap
at
the
sea
dog
brewery
this
one
was
a
bright
orange
color
with
good
clarity
the
onefinger
of
white
head
retained
itself
as
a
clingy
ring
and
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
smoky
with
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
character
for
a
pale
ale
along
with
some
dry
hops
notes
the
flavors
were
full
of
yeast
biscuity
malt
and
some
herbal
hops
that
added
a
rather
crisp
and
bitter
finish
rather
weird
for
an
apa
but
not
bad
at
all
the
body
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
were
all
average
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
buttery
malt
light
green
apple
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
of
buttery
malt
graham
cracker
like
the
hops
dont
really
play
a
role
here
except
for
bittering
the
feel
is
moderate
with
semi
soft
carbonation
finishes
slightly
bitter
an
ok
apa
a
bit
too
buttery
and
not
enough
of
a
hop
flavor
for
me
this
beer
has
all
the
defining
characteristics
of
a
shipyard
brew
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
smallish
white
head
some
retention
the
beer
is
decently
carbonated
the
nose
is
buttery
malt
with
a
goodly
dose
of
yeast
the
taste
is
all
shipyard
there
is
plenty
of
diacetyl
toffee
and
yeast
there
is
a
dry
saltene
cracker
like
finish
to
the
beer
with
a
slightly
sweeter
buttery
malty
middle
with
a
touch
of
dry
caramel
throughout
there
is
a
nice
balance
to
the
beer
but
the
buttery
toffee
the
dry
caramel
the
yeast
consistency
and
the
salty
finish
have
shipyard
written
all
over
it
its
a
good
beer
but
the
brewer
isnt
pushing
the
boundaries
any
with
this
fine
selection
this
one
came
in
a
12
variety
pack
luckily
i
was
able
to
split
it
open
rather
than
having
to
purchase
way
more
shipyard
than
i
would
have
preferred
thin
on
the
tongue
and
crisp
not
bad
i
guess
grainy
and
biscuity
and
not
at
all
like
an
apa
easy
drinker
i
will
pass
in
the
future
this
shipyard
product
chamberlain
pale
ale
was
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
into
a
clear
clean
16
ounce
mixing
glass
normally
a
draft
product
for
me
i
was
happy
to
have
one
at
home
a
a
thin
reddishorange
hue
with
no
haze
or
sediment
a
quick
bit
of
head
then
nothing
during
the
drinking
there
was
no
brewers
lace
either
s
slightly
piney
or
floral
but
not
overpowering
actually
the
smell
was
one
of
a
dated
beer
but
only
partially
t
despite
my
average
a
s
the
taste
really
the
most
important
part
of
the
review
was
enjoyable
a
slightly
thin
drinking
pale
ale
closer
to
a
bitter
or
an
esb
in
my
opinion
not
as
hoppy
as
many
of
the
newer
pale
ales
but
very
enjoyable
really
this
is
closer
to
a
session
ale
for
me
when
shipyard
started
brewing
this
beer
was
probably
considered
hoppy
now
many
other
breweries
have
passed
it
by
in
the
rush
for
hop
domination
m
again
the
word
thin
comes
to
mind
for
the
mouthfeel
d
drinkability
is
very
good
as
i
could
have
many
of
these
again
a
decent
pale
ale
but
a
highly
enjoyable
very
drinkable
beer
very
nice
clean
pale
ale
pours
clear
copper
with
the
advertised
white
head
crisp
nose
of
crystal
and
pale
malt
with
golding
and
cascaded
hops
some
peppery
hops
and
a
sour
malt
up
front
with
smoother
caramel
malt
sweetness
at
the
end
nearly
like
an
esb
far
superior
to
sierra
nevada
part
of
the
shipyard
variety
pack
picked
up
for
a
bargain
at
the
local
supermercado
twist
off
cap
smell
is
an
earthy
hoppy
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
barleywine
smell
pours
to
a
metallic
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
head
taste
is
the
earthy
but
dull
bitterness
followed
by
a
citrusy
sweetness
the
finish
stays
sweet
but
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
this
as
my
previous
taste
appears
to
be
a
definite
east
coast
more
english
pale
ale
v
a
west
coast
pale
ale
a
refreshing
change
from
the
cascades
yet
tasty
and
highly
imbibeable
this
so
far
appears
to
be
the
best
of
the
shipyards
selection
this
brew
would
go
great
with
fish
and
chips
preferably
beerbattered
walleye
or
fresh
codfish
american
pale
ale
theres
nothing
very
american
about
it
the
ringwood
yeast
gives
off
a
lot
of
creamy
fruit
in
the
aroma
and
taste
while
the
hops
are
incredibly
grassy
this
beer
also
only
leans
to
the
bitter
side
of
thing
slightly
for
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
but
the
ibus
here
arent
too
big
however
for
what
this
beer
is
and
whatever
it
is
its
pretty
decent
and
a
nice
session
ale
282008
just
bought
this
one
and
a
few
other
singles
at
a
local
store
with
quite
a
few
craft
beers
i
generally
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
shipyard
but
this
one
was
a
somewhat
pleasant
surprise
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
moderate
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
taste
consists
of
a
little
malt
floral
sweetness
and
a
nice
dry
hoppy
bite
not
bad
and
actually
probably
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
sampled
from
this
company
medium
effervescence
medium
bodied
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
although
it
is
darker
than
most
nothing
bad
really
though
nothing
for
the
nose
to
enjoy
theres
nothing
to
make
this
stand
out
either
appears
a
pale
copper
slightly
hazed
with
chill
large
foaming
off
white
head
with
fine
even
lacing
strung
on
my
imperial
pint
with
each
sip
aroma
is
full
of
pungent
citric
hops
mild
floral
tones
as
well
really
citrus
zest
is
the
dominant
scent
going
on
some
pale
biscuit
malt
notes
going
on
provide
enough
sweetness
to
compete
with
the
hops
i
have
to
mention
the
ringwood
yeast
note
that
comes
out
in
every
shipyard
brew
ive
ever
tasted
that
edge
brings
a
tart
almost
sourdough
note
with
a
touch
of
oak
barrel
character
and
leather
flavors
collide
hops
and
malts
and
than
the
ringwood
hammer
drops
touch
of
toasted
biscuit
and
citrus
hops
among
the
flood
of
yeast
character
that
i
already
described
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
oily
with
hops
and
carbonation
is
sturdy
almost
tickling
the
back
of
the
throat
drinkability
is
decent
but
the
never
ending
ringwood
edge
gets
in
the
way
of
my
enjoyment
solid
new
england
style
pale
ale
drinkability
nice
tasting
beer
from
a
cask
would
buy
it
again
abover
average
beer
i
would
say
drinkability
was
good
this
stuff
goes
down
quickly
and
surely
enough
quicker
than
youd
expect
from
an
ale
shipyard
has
always
made
good
beers
and
this
one
joins
the
ranks
cheers
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
color
ale
with
a
good
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
notes
aroma
of
english
dry
hops
with
a
nice
medium
sweet
caramel
malt
base
taste
is
also
a
well
balance
mix
between
some
english
style
hops
with
some
notes
of
delicious
caramel
malt
very
well
balance
overall
with
loads
of
character
but
still
easily
drinkable
full
body
with
good
carbonation
really
well
made
and
possibly
helps
that
i
got
a
really
fresh
bottle
directly
from
the
brewery
palate
is
very
mild
in
flavors
across
the
board
toasty
malt
with
balancing
hops
not
too
much
and
rather
thin
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
exciting
either
i
really
miss
being
up
in
porme
d
a
nice
pale
in
more
of
the
english
style
and
very
good
drinkability
on
cask
for
sure
i
have
not
had
this
in
bottles
but
i
can
almost
bet
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
smooth
feel
and
sweet
aroma
this
has
very
mild
made
for
sessioning
an
easy
to
quaff
pale
d
this
is
a
good
session
brew
with
an
alcohol
below
5
and
there
is
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
when
you
are
drinking
it
cask
tends
to
make
everything
taste
just
a
bit
better
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
its
a
decent
beer
and
if
you
want
to
have
cask
beer
for
the
sake
of
having
cask
beer
then
it
will
suit
you
however
i
found
it
just
be
an
ordinary
beer
overall
taste
is
dryish
wellbalanced
with
light
sweetness
and
bitterness
leafy
toasty
with
light
caramelbutterscotch
yeatiness
and
hint
of
toasted
buttered
bread
hop
character
is
light
but
noiticeable
a
bit
leafy
and
faintly
citrusy
it
is
very
nice
characterful
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
wellrounded
firm
body
the
taste
is
quite
rich
more
than
i
was
expecting
based
on
the
clarity
of
the
beer
this
is
definitely
akin
to
a
nice
british
pale
ale
its
not
really
a
hoppy
pale
ale
but
more
of
a
balanced
one
with
a
nice
smooth
taste
the
aftertaste
has
that
familiar
ringwood
flavor
that
i
am
trying
to
grow
accustomed
to
and
look
past
when
i
drink
shipyards
beers
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
although
my
friends
and
i
were
blown
away
by
the
tastiness
of
this
beer
i
have
a
feeling
my
impression
of
a
bottle
would
be
very
different
i
m
excited
about
trying
other
varieties
on
cask
at
oldsmar
tap
house
which
i
highly
recommend
if
you
live
in
the
tampa
bay
area
d
a
bit
bitter
for
my
liking
otherwise
id
call
it
a
session
definitely
worth
a
try
id
pair
with
with
anything
grilled
on
a
summer
day
very
drinkable
good
session
beer
d
its
a
nice
chill
beer
easy
to
drink
and
sit
by
watching
the
day
or
night
pass
on
by
d
very
nice
good
summer
beer
this
is
a
malty
pale
vs
a
hoppy
pale
ale
hop
heads
may
be
disappointed
hops
mostly
dominate
the
beer
than
one
would
expect
could
have
been
slightly
more
sweet
to
balance
it
out
but
the
buttery
aspect
of
the
beer
helps
with
that
a
little
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
bottle
had
a
very
slight
head
and
a
little
lacing
looked
a
hazy
copper
the
smell
was
very
piney
to
me
in
the
hop
form
along
with
the
taste
the
taste
also
had
a
trub
resembalence
to
me
lighter
to
a
medium
mouthfeel
it
was
not
that
bad
of
a
brew
drinkability
seems
ok
pours
a
very
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
that
reduced
into
a
half
inch
white
cap
with
little
lacing
smells
faintly
fruity
the
taste
is
full
of
bready
malt
flavor
buttery
in
the
finish
subtle
hop
presence
despite
the
difference
in
styles
i
thought
this
beer
had
a
distinctly
heinekenlike
flavor
medium
bodied
and
viscous
it
stays
on
the
tongue
overall
a
fine
session
beer
id
have
it
again
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
filtered
light
orange
in
color
the
head
on
this
one
rises
very
well
but
gives
back
some
smell
has
lemon
zest
dry
grain
and
a
dusty
hop
aroma
this
brew
has
a
biscuity
flavor
to
it
a
little
bready
too
a
touch
of
buttery
flavor
creeps
in
so
this
must
mean
those
named
flavors
are
its
bread
and
butter
haha
its
all
good
this
one
tastes
english
inspired
not
a
hoppy
brew
at
all
drinkability
union
general
joshua
lawrence
chamberlain
was
a
badass
this
beer
not
so
much
got
this
beer
out
of
a
shipyard
variety
pack
a
great
pale
ale
had
a
nice
light
amber
color
loved
the
portrait
of
joshua
chamberlain
on
the
bottle
label
smelled
light
and
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
a
hoppy
smell
tasted
like
it
smelled
with
the
right
kick
of
hops
to
where
it
was
not
overly
bitter
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
picked
this
up
at
the
whole
foods
market
was
attracted
to
it
by
the
label
im
a
big
history
buff
and
chamberlain
was
one
of
my
favorite
figures
from
the
civil
war
the
beer
overall
has
a
good
taste
smoth
flavor
easy
to
drink
not
overtly
hoppy
slight
grain
cprn
aftertaste
but
not
too
much
overall
i
would
rate
this
a
good
all
around
beer
its
a
good
beer
for
a
bud
light
drinker
to
be
able
to
enjoy
something
different
and
appritiate
that
a
beer
does
not
have
to
be
watered
down
to
be
drinkable
ie
taste
isnt
bad
this
is
a
good
beer
that
starts
with
a
hoppy
bite
but
balances
just
at
the
end
with
a
touch
of
malt
it
is
definitly
a
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
no
matter
the
season
with
a
body
thats
not
too
much
for
warm
days
the
taste
has
many
elements
of
citrus
and
metallic
touches
the
smell
is
typical
of
this
type
of
beer
with
nothing
standing
out
to
me
pours
a
light
reddish
amber
with
gold
highlights
and
no
head
aromas
are
predominantly
hoppy
with
lemony
metals
showing
and
some
biscuity
malts
backing
things
up
on
the
palate
bitterness
is
substantial
firstoff
with
lots
of
metallic
flavors
from
the
hops
coming
through
at
the
midpalate
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
expertly
balanced
by
the
malt
though
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
malt
doesnt
contribute
much
aside
from
a
clover
honey
in
tea
kind
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
otherwise
typical
overall
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
amber
ale
nothing
special
but
certainly
something
that
i
could
order
a
few
times
22oz
bomber
with
new
yellow
packaging
pours
a
light
orange
amber
very
clear
liquid
lots
of
foam
that
recedes
to
an
18
inch
cap
aroma
of
ringwood
yeast
which
includes
buttery
caramel
and
a
banana
fruitiness
flavor
is
not
aggressive
but
mellow
and
delicious
hops
are
also
mellow
and
a
bitterness
builds
on
the
palate
that
increases
the
dryness
well
made
with
nothing
out
of
balance
marmalade
flavors
emerge
as
beer
warms
this
brew
is
mostly
sweet
and
fruity
with
hops
playing
the
role
of
taming
with
bitterness
purchased
bevmo
palmdale
ca
i
found
this
one
to
be
more
of
a
pale
ale
overall
than
an
amber
regardless
it
was
still
nicely
balanced
and
had
a
good
amount
of
flavour
to
it
for
whatever
reason
i
was
a
bit
surprised
at
how
enjoyable
this
one
was
i
definately
would
wash
down
some
of
jacks
whole
belly
clams
with
a
couple
of
these
any
day
drinkability
moderate
light
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
big
at
first
then
a
fade
to
blotch
lacing
that
clung
nicely
to
the
glass
in
spots
smell
was
mainly
malt
with
barely
a
hint
of
hops
first
nose
hit
was
that
of
freshly
mowed
grass
and
bread
taste
is
okay
nothing
too
impressive
although
i
thought
the
taste
balance
of
malt
and
hops
was
very
good
on
the
light
side
of
most
pale
ales
ive
had
lately
more
like
a
matured
lager
quaffable
could
drink
these
all
day
long
overall
average
would
not
turn
this
down

wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
with
so
many
more
to
discover
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
rather
disappointing
with
some
faint
malt
and
a
sweet
soaplike
fragrance
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
but
lacks
in
flavor
compared
to
some
of
the
better
pale
ales
out
there
overall
this
is
a
rather
average
pale
ale
that
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way

the
rest

accented
by

yeasty
notes

flavor
is

toasty

a
very
middleofthe
road
beer
with
great
drinkability
id
have
to
say
that
out
of
the
sampler
case
i
bought
of
this
the
pale
ale
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
of
the
four
and
the
one
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
most
this
one
is
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
particularly
special
has
nice
qualities
but
is
a
bit
too
buttery
and
yeasty
for
a
truly
sessionable
ale
but
is
worth
checking
out
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
a
brown
head
of
foam
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
with
some
hops
and
fruitiness
seems
sweet
judging
by
the
aroma
taste
is
much
of
the
same
except
that
theres
a
sort
of
biscuity
goodness
to
the
flavor

and
drinkable

pale
ale

a
clear

crystal
malts
and
crisp

flavor
is
sharp
and
malty
with
a
solid
bitterness
and
some
toasted
flavor
towards
the
end
ringwood
flavor
is
there
but
its
light
and
doesnt
hurt
the
beer
im
not
sure
why
this
one
is
listed
as
a
amberred
ale
although
it
might
straddle
the
border
between
that
and
pale
ale

really

out
a

beer
probably
a
decent
session
beer
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
its
quite
ironic
that
a
beer
named
after
the
union
officer
who
held
the
flank
at
gettysburg
or
everyone
would
be
saying
yall
now
is
a
beer
without
real
direction
there
is
stuff
going
on
but
no
real
plancourse
of
taste
action
it
tastes
confused
again
a
bitter
pun
intended
irony
given
the
namesake
i
do
think
it
would
benefit
greatly
with
some
simple
pub
fair
and
it
probably
would
be
very
good
with
such
but
alone
i
think
unless
offered
one
pass
on
getting
more
for
myself
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
first
tried
it
a
couple
years
ago
not
because
i
was
a
big
beer
fan
but
because
chamberlain
is
my
favorite
historical
figure
overall
though
this
beer
is
great
it
has
really
nice
hoppy
flavor
thats
not
too
overpowering
really
pretty
copper
color
and
a
pretty
smooth
drink
im
happy
its
coming
to
the
connecticut
market
as
i
was
making
yearly
trips
to
maine
to
get
a
case
of
the
22oz
bottles
cheers

smells
of

and
maybe
some
honey
with
some
hop
tastes
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
to
it
the
flavor
holds
on
to
your
tongue
and
has
a
slight
carbonated
hint
to
it
as
it
goes
down
excellent
beer
shipyard
has
got
to
be
getting
big
with
the
beers
they
are
producing
they
are
no
slouch

the

chamberlain
pale
ale
is
a
beautifully
done
english
pale
ale
that
can
only
be
fully
enjoyed
at
cellar
temperature
it
needs
a
rough
pour
to
raise
its
head
and
release
some
co2
and
a
bit
of
warming
from
the
fridge
otherwise
its
almost
another

some

a

leave
it
kind

nutty
wellrounded
full

beautifully
balanced
very
drinkable
kind
of
a
very
special
bitter
in
my
opinion
well
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
english
ales
d
yeah
it
goes
down
okay
but
im
not
buying
another
one
of
these
if
some
else
wants
to
buy
one
for
me
well
then
ill
drink
it
just
to
be
nice

if
you
put

yoiu
put

you
would
produce
a
better
product
and
likely
sell
more
of
em
down
the

about
12
of
this
one
went
a
medium
body
that
turns
kind
of
fluffy
and
cream
like
in
the
mouthfeel
an
easy
one
to
drink
for
sure
with
its
mild
abv
and
an
interesting
hop
to
it

the
taste
worth
a
go
cheers
drinkability
just
doesnt
work
to
well
for
me
this
was
in
a
22
oz
bomber
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
white
lace
head
and
a
golden
hue
the
aroma
is
that
of
an
ale
w
a
touch
of
floral
hops
the
taste
though
brings
out
a
spicy
hop
profile
there
is
a
thinish
body
that
makes
the
brew
easy
to
go
down
and
you
can
feel
and
malt
balance
in
the
end
overall
the
brew
tastes
a
lot
like
an
english
pa
or
bitter
thats
just
mho
chamberlain
pale
ale
isnt
a
head
turner
but
it
is
a
reasonably
tasty
sessionable
offering
that
is
one
of
shipyards
best
only
old
thumper
of
the
ones
that
ive
had
is
clearly
the
superior
beer
i
cant
say
that
id
drink
a
lot
of
it
if
i
was
a
maineite
but
i
still
had
a
good
time
from
start
to
finish
rich
auburn
color
with
good
head
malty
aroma
with
a
little
hops
quite
tasty
with
a
good
malty
sweetness
and
a
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
a
drinkable
beer
with
its
pleasing
taste
and
low
abv
that
would
be
especially
nice
for
those
who
dont
like
too
much
hops
is
it
the
best
beer
nowhere
near
but
as
something
worth
buying
ill
give
it
points
and
it
supports
the
restoration
and
maintence
of
the
home
of
a
true
hero
this
beer
pours
orange
with
a
nice
head
from
a
22
ounce
brown
bottle
the
aroma
is
hoppy
taste
has
some
good
hoppiness
but
definitely
strongly
influenced
by
their
yeast
which
gives
a
butterscotch
like
flavor
which
either
you
like
or
you
dont
i
tend
not
to
like
it
very
much
this
is
actually
a
pretty
decent
offering
well
worth
trying
next
extremely
drinkable
and
mild
beer
next
time
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
british
ale
i
will
get
this
instead
i
found
this
to
be
a
refreshing
brew
that
was
interesting
enough
to
keep
my
attention
crispy
and
fairly
dry
pretty
damn
good
and
worthy
of
some
future
gobblage
what
style
is
this
i
was
expecting
apa
and
the
first
notes
made
me
think
as
much
but
the
ba
style
says
amberred
ale
ok
maybe
its
a
little
of
all
of
these
styles
hard
to
categorize
but
the
real
bottom
line
is
that
it
really
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
just
the
label
on
the
bottle
makes
this
ale
worthy
if
you
are
a
civil
war
buff
but
it
does
have
some
other
good
points
too
it
pours
a
pretty
standard
coppery
and
bubbly
amber
with
a
two
finger
khaki
head
the
ringwood
a
shipyard
signature
is
evident
in
the
aroma
as
is
butter
and
pine
the
latter
particularly
appropriate
for
a
leading
microbrewery
from
the
pine
tree
state
the
taste
is
exactly
what
the
redolence
would
suggest
a
bit
more
of
the
caramel
than
the
pine
i
would
say
and
the
finish
is
bready
theres
a
smooth
feel
to
the
mouth
and
more
subtle
carbonation
than
the
plethora
of
rising
bubbles
would
suggest
a
fine
ale
for
a
clear
warm
summer
evening
on
the
shore
of
one
of
maines
many
beautiful
lakes
i
just
wish
i
could
get
cases
of
this
stuff
the
beer
pours
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
it
also
has
a
fruity
yeast
scent
and
some
mild
hopping
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
is
light
with
some
caramel
notes
it
also
has
a
bitter
hop
finish
that
balances
well
with
the
ringwood
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
none
of
their
beers
are
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
how
can
anyone
really
complain
although
this
wont
go
on
my
short
list
of
beers
to
seek
i
will
order
it
again
if
i
run
across
it
fits
nicely
between
apa
and
ipa
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
the
start
the
finish
is
crisp
the
malts
softly
linger
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
down
a
notch
for
me
as
this
was
somewhat
bland
on
the
flavor
front
excellent
head
and
lacing
very
light
and
pleasing
long
lasting
nice
pale
color
moderate
carbonation
nice
whif
of
maltiness
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
spiciness
what
sold
this
brew
however
is
the
taste
very
nice
and
sweet
malt
signature
with
appropriate
accompanying
hops
a
warning
however
if
you
are
a
hophead
and
are
looking
for
a
very
hoppy
pale
ale
this
beer
might
not
be
for
you
that
said
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
could
be
a
session
beer
almost
feels
like
a
throwback
beer
a
la

pennant

very
nice

refreshing

mixed

there
is
also
a

hoppy
presence
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
enjoy
this
beer
when
its
available
drinkability
is
above
average
if
only
because
the
flavor
is
too
mild
to
be
offensive

the
head
stayed
around
and
did
not
fade
as
the
lace
ringed
the
glass
with
a
thick
film
the
aroma
had
a
citric
hop
to
it
the
taste
was
a
well
balanced
blend
of
sweet
creamy
malt
with
some
hop
bitterness
to
crisp
up
the
brew
an

abv
the
lowest
in
the
collection
it
was
easy
for
summer
doings
busy
times
my
first
shipyard
brew
and
one
of
the
better
bottled
maine
microbrews
i
sampled
during
my
week
in
the
pine
tree
state
this
is
an
ale
that
i
could
enjoy
time
and
time
again
very
well
done
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed

light
beige

lightly
copper

laces

aroma
is
malty
with
a
tinge
of
hops
and
maybe
a
sniff
of
vanilla
as
well
taste
is
reasonably
malts
for
a
pale
ale
and
then
closes
with
a
nice
hit
of
hops
wellbalanced
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
excellent
very
drinkable
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
of
a
hop
presence
over
all
a
very
nice
brew
probably
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
shipyard
brewing
company
one
of
the
better
beers
i
had
from
shipyard
while
up
in
mainepours
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
a
big
blooming
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
lightly
toasted
malt
and
a
little
sweettaste
is
malty
dominat
with
some
nice
fruity
estures
that
lingerlight
hop
note
in
the
finish
to
balance
this
brew
out
was
told
this
is
hard
to
find
outside
of
maine
iam
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
i
kinda
have
to
like
this
beer
as
im
a
civil
war
reenactor
in
one
of
the
companies
of
the
20th
maine
chamberlain
commanded
the
20th
at
gettysburg
thankfully
this
is
a
very
good
and
drinkable
pale
ale
a
light
brown
in
colour
with
a
lovely
head
big
and
smelly
hops
and
light
spices
to
the
nose
a
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
maybe
a
tad
too
thin
but
im
not
complaining
at
a
reenacting
event
this
beer
is
a
must
just
as
little
johns
root
beer
overall
a
very
surprising
brew
from
shipyard
i
dont
like
chamberlain
in
the
bottle
and
i
only
tried
this
because
it
was
on
cask
a
good
move
by
me
on
cask
it
was
much
smoother
and
the
complexity
of
the
ingredients
was
much
more
noticeable
the
flavor
of
the
citrus
hops
were
really
standing
out
here
as
well
as
the
biscuit
malt
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
if
i
have
to
find
a
fault
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
wee
bit
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
imho
another
great
beer
from
maine
joshua
lawrence
chamberlain
the
arch
opponent
of
the
temperance
movement
in
maine
while
he
was
governor
has
a
great
pale
ale
named
in
his
honor
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
good
head
taste
is
perfect
for
the
style
almost
like
when
you
first
drank
sasperilla
soda
you
know
what
a
pale
ale
is
with
this
good
carbonation
the
dry
but
not
sweet
taste
this
is
a
winner
how
could
anyone
not
like
a
brew
named
for
and
bearing
the
likeness
of
joshua
lawrence
chamberlain
the
beers
appearance
is
a
deep
copper
with
a
thick
head
i
experienced
a
pleasant
bite
from
my
nose
to
my
throat
the
finish
had
an
eversoslight
hint
of
citrus
overall
a
good
pale
ale
in
a
very
nice
package
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
pale
ale
nice
artwork
on
the
22
oz
bomber
deep
copper
color
with
a
stick
foamy
head
the
aroma
of
mellow
spicy
hops
has
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
to
it
the
first
sip
presents
a
buttery
spicy
ale
with
a
bold
malt
flavor
the
body
is
quite
smooth
ad
heavy
enhancing
the
balance
of
the
flavors
the
bitterness
is
immediately
apparent
and
lingers
well
through
the
experience
very
nice
brew
pours
a
nice
sexy
copper
color
with
very
little
head
and
lace
not
a
very
strong
malt
smell
but
it
taste
pretty
good
with
a
good
variation
of
hops
that
leaves
a
bitter
after
taste
finishes
strong
with
the
pale
style
overall
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
nice
crisp
but
creamy
body
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
must
join
johnnyp
in
asking
why
is
this
not
sold
in
sixpacks
dull
copper
color
maybe
light
brown
depending
on
the
light
i
tried
for
a
hard
pour
and
a
big
head
got
a
nice
foamy
2
inch
cloud
top
that
laced
the
glass
nicely
herbal
hop
nearly
medicinal
nose
somewhat
odd
sourness
as
well
taste
was
very
balanced
hoppy
start
creamy
and
very
easy
going
down
very
good
pale
ale
better
than
most
a
bit
of
a
watery
thin
finish
is
the
only
downside
but
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
pale
ale
cool
name
fitting
tribute
to
a
great
man
i
like
the
beers
that
take
a
historical
twist
i
bought
singles
and

at
the

bittering
hops
but
as
in
the

they
are
much
more
subtle
and
earthy
wonderfully
creamy
yeat
not
heavy
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
ive
only
tried
two
brews
from

so
far
but
they
have
both
been
excellent
highly
suggested
just
make
sure
you
serve
these
north

get
the
true
character
of
them
yet
another
huge
thanks
to
the
bierman
for
this

notes
quite
a

for

the

plays
a

from

holy

is
my
favorite
beer
i
have
only
been
only
been
drinking
for
ten
years
and
i
have
had
alot
of
different
beers
i
am
by
no
means
an
expert
connoisseur
but
i
do
enjoy
its
malty
taste
and
feel
murky

one

no

easy
drinking
beer
has
a

kerosene

that
is
not
that
unpleasant
side
note
poured
from

at
mcnellies
public
house
in
oklahoma
city
cool
bottle
not
so
cool
beer
little
sweet
malty
scent
but
not
too
aromatic
off
white
head
dissipated
quickly
tastes
slightly
sweet
malty
and
maybe
a
little
yeasty
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
more
than
i
expected
from
a
gimmicky
beer
fun
novelty
not
too
bad
i
guess
i
expected
more
from
it
considering
name
price
the
fact
that
it
is
tempered
over
burning
witches
lots
of
understated
flavor
just
not
overly
remarkable
i
put
it
in
the
have
to
at
least
try
it
once
category
it
has
a
very
nice
aroma
and
compliments
a
meal
very
well
o
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
variety
of
flavors

overly
complex
but
not
expected
to

session
beer
3
55
quite
average
certainly
nothing
special
sampled
by
bottle
very
nice
ale
have
consumed
many
and
would
recommend
it
the
fizzy
head
and
lack
of
lacing
detract
from
the
appearance
still
not
a
tasty
as
a
yorkshire
dark
ale
its
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
was
ok
i
liked
the
beer
but
it
was
ok
to
me
i
would
not
mind
trying
it
again
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
have
had
this
beer
i
actually
have
forgotten
how
it
taste
i
remember
that
it
had
a
fruit
flavor
to
it
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
remember
all
i
know
is
that
i
did
not
mind
drinking
this
beer
if
i
could
find
this
beer
again
i
would
have
no
problem
trying
it
again
all
that
i
can
remember
about
this
beer
is
that
it
was
ok
overall
it
was
good
but
not
great
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
foam
of
white
and
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
bubbles
going
up
the
glass
it
looks
rather
nice
though
it
could
use
more
head
still
rather
true
to
style
scents
of
toasted
malt
floral
earthy
and
herbal
english
hops
that
lend
a
nice
earthy
tealike
quality
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
slight
applelike
fruity
esters
a
fairly
nice
aroma
that
is
true
to
style
and
inviting
if
a
bit
subdued
still
quite
well
done
flavor
begins
sweet
with
hints
apple
toffee
and
faint
caramel
and
a
mineral
water
quality
this
sustains
throughout
the
sip
in
the
middle
an
extremely
faint
hint
of
herbal
hops
comes
through
and
sustains
into
the
finish
finish
is
very
faint
herbal
hops
apple
toffee
and
hard
water
aftertaste
is
pale
malt
sweetness
and
mild
herbal
hop
flavors
with
a
bit
of
honey
not
a
bad
flavor
profile
for
the
style
though
fairly
subdued
and
mild
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
true
to
form
and
quite
enjoyable
on
the
palette
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
moderate
yet
smooth
feeling
carbonation
level
and
a
drying
feel
slightly
chalky
feel
quite
good
feels
like
a
pubstyle
ale
and
is
easily
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
though
fairly
standard
english
pale
it
hits
the
style
notes
but
doesnt
knock
them
out
of
the
park
still
its
easy
to
drink
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
so
its
fine
in
my
book
and
worth
trying
just
to
say
youve
had
it
overall
pretty
basic
epa
nothing
spectacular
and
nothing
bad
just
really
simple
and
easy
to
drink
great
for
a
tasting
party
or
the
british
humor
fan
good
beer
all
in
all
oa
decent
beer
i
have
had
much
better
english
ales
but
also
much
worse
sorry
the
monty
python
thing
doesnt
sway
me
either
way
the
taste
has
all
the
expected
elements
of
a
sweet
english
pale
ale
with
sweet
malts
toffee
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
but
nothing
the
overwhelms
i
used
to
drink
the
original
english
version
and
i
think
it
is
superior
to
the
americanbrewed
version
but
this
still
holds
its
own
in
a
pinch
i
got
this
purely
because
of
the
name
of
the
brew
which
im
sure
was
black
sheeps
market
gimmick
it
worked
overall
i
was
not
disappointed
but
i
have
had
many
beers
that
were
better
the
appearance
suggested
it
would
be
an
amber
or
wheat
ale
but
the
flavour
was
much
more
bitter
had
this
one
a
while
back
but
was
so
stfaced
i
dont
remember
what
i
thought
of
it
anyway
saw
it
again
and
had
to
grab
it
i
mean
really
anything
tempered
over
burning
witches
cant
be
bad
right
well
for
what
i
can
only
regard
as
a
novelty
beer
its
not
bad
not
too
bitter
nothing
sweet
and
with
decent
carbonation
its
beer
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
pound
a
bunch
of
these
and
have
a
great
time
recommendable
cheers
o
an
ok
beer
but
will
not
get
again
overall
my
first
english
pale
ale
so
i
cant
speak
too
much
about
how
this
stacks
up
to
others
in
the
style
overall
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
muted
malty
notes
and
a
dry
finish
glad
i
had
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
as
i
prefer
english
bitters
over
this
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
starts
off
stronger
than
it
finishes
as
each
sip
flattens
out
on
the
end
it
remains
crisp
but
it
goes
fairly
limp
on
the
tongue
from
time
to
time
smoothness
suffers
a
little
the
overall
dryness
runs
from
beginning
to
end
you
call
that
beer
id
rather
have
another
rufus
ok
though
not
mindboggling
it
looks
lovely
but
this
is
its
best
aspect
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
balanced
but
rather
dull
stewed
hops
and
ale
yeast
notes
abound
body
is
alright
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
special
its
fame
begins
and
ends
with
monty
python
goes
down
easily
enough
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
not
terribly
unique
but
good
stuff
much
better
all
around
if
its
not
so
cold
yeah
well
its
english
very
very
drinkable
think
green
onions
by
booker
t
and
the
mgs
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
groove
thatll
make
you
smile
id
have
another
one
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
one
and
after
finally
trying
it
i
see
why
ive
overlooked
it
for
so
long
it
pours
a
standard
golden
color
clear
with
an
oatmeal
looking
head
without
much
retention
the
nose
is
sweet
english
malts
a
little
on
the
stale
side
and
a
slight
skunky
aroma
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
with
the
sweetness
being
quite
intense
in
the
end
its
got
a
tin
body
without
nearly
enough
carbonation
and
has
a
sort
of
spoiled
aftertaste
its
grainy
and
light
for
those
who
get
off
on
that
sort
of
thing
but
its
a
far
cry
from
the
best
english
ales
maybe
its
better
from
the
bottle
but
im
not
sure
ill
invest
in
another
one
of
these
anytime
soon
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
overall
a
decent
session
but
lots
of
tart
and
tanginess
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
its
rather
complex
for
a
lightbodied
beer
o
overall
a
solid
drinker
and
would
have
it
again
not
the
least
bit
unpleasant
and
very
refreshing
3

given
the
style
and
the
taste
i
recommend
being
cautious
with
your
food
pairings
this
beer
is
probably
best
as
a
standalone
session
beer
or
paired
with
something
light
i
was
snacking
on
pita
bread
and
hummus
which
proved
a
good
match
decent
amber
ale
color
smells
like
blatant
gummy
bears
much
more
complex
than
you
would
expect
definitely
on
the
sweet
and
fruity
end
good
beer
for
the
summer
sun
decent
drinkability
tastes
better
than
a
shitty
novelty
beernot
awesome
but
better
than
you
would
expect
overall
bit
of
floral
and
spicy
bitterness
but
nowhere
near
enough
carbonation
not
strong
enough
and
not
well
put
together
after
15
minutes
it
feels
like
a
headache
too
drinkability
it
is
crisp
clean
and
tasty
all
around
good
stuff
in
my
book
o
still
cant
figure
out
how
this
is
an
ale
this
is
not
an
ale
this
is
definitely
not
the
holy
grail
of
ales
this
is
a
marketing
ploy
the
bottle
is
kind
of
cute
especially
the
part
about
being
brewed
over
the
bodies
of
burning
witches
but
this
beer
is
all
hipe
and
no
hops
stay
away
stay
far
away
unless
you
like
miller
lite
at
4
times
the
price
o
this
one
was
a
meh
for
me
its
not
ad
but
nothing
about
it
makes
it
beyond
average
now
why
arent
more
beers
tempered
over
burning
witches
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
biscuit
dry
grass
light
honey
light
flowers
and
a
touch
of
cedar
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
light
biscuit
grass
and
a
pinch
of
vanilla
and
powdered
sugar
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
epa
one
thats
mild
without
being
boring
and
one
that
lends
itself
to
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
o
a
decent
english
pale
ale
onot
something
that
i
want
to
try
again
total

monty

ale
poured
a
darker
golden
color
with
not
much
head
the
aroma
was
weak
and
had
hints
of
floral
notes
the
taste
was
had
a
profound
malty
backbone
with
hints
of
a
floral
hoppy
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
a
little
lite
in
flavor
overall
this
is
a
solid
average
beer
has
a
stronger
malt
flavor
then
other
pale
ales
enjoyable
but
nothing
spectacular
onot
what
i
expected
but
somewhat
enjoyable
this
would
be
worth
trying
again
with
a
meal
i
could
see
this
being
consumed
in
quantities
before
a
football
game
while
grilling
out
o
no
complaints
here
this
obviously
isnt
one
to
seek
out
but
its
a
better
alternative
then
adjunct
lagers
overall
i
stayed
away
from
this
one
for
a
while
because
of
the
negative
reviews
i
finally
broke
down
and
purchased
it
in
a
mixed
six

well
with
this

o
overall
a
decent
brew
that
offers
sessionability
and
a
decent
depth
of
flavor
o
high
drinkability
a
british
session
beer
not
good
as
monty
phyton
the
beer
is
copper
to
amber
in
color
with
a
tiny
fleeting
head
that
leaves
virtually
no
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
weak
with
faint
scents
of
malt
biscuits
a
hint
of
citrus
the
flavor
is
unassertive
and
fairly
bland
hints
of
malt
bread
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
finish
overall
this
was
mediocre
monty
python
is
hilarious
but
this
beer
is
unremarkable
overy
disappointing
gimmicky
wont
seek
out
again
beer
is
thin
very
thin
a
little
grainy
creamy
yeasty
mild
biscuit
it
tastes
ok
but
it
is
a
boring
little
beer
not
a
repeat
o
crisp
sessionable
yet
more
like
a
sequel
than
the
real
deal
its
just
a
flesh
wound
if
im
going
to
drink
like
the
knights
of
the
round
table
quench
my
thirst
with
a
brew
that
slaps
me
from
my
horse
and
dances
silly
jigs
while
farting
in
my
general
direction
o
one
and
done
it
was
a
freebie
and
went
well
with
the
pie
but
the
label
is
more
appealing
than
the
beer
oh
well
not
bad
review
from

notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
an
nice
orange
amber
thin
white
head
with
no
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
with
a
buttery
element
taste
is
not
quite
as
nice
as
the
aroma
but
pleasant
sweet
malt
slight
grain
and
a
hint
of
hops
a
somewhat
abrupt
dry
finish
a
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
ale
not
bad
really
for
a
gimmick
ale
o
did
i
possibly
get
a
bad
batch
this
is
a
terrible
tasting
beer
would
not
recommend
overall
it
wasnt
bad
i
like
it
better
than
the
aforementioned
in
taste
not
high
on
it
though
o
tempered
witches
nah
decent
beer
yup
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
pale
copper
coloring
with
a
thin
white
frothy
film
covering
the
surface
of
the
brew
aromas
of
toffee
and
roasted
nut
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
hops
flavors
are
rich
and
tangy
sweet
with
toffee
and
hazelnut
characteristics
cleaned
up
by
a
peppery
hopping
at
the
end
of
the
palate
very
light
bodied
and
a
steady
carbonation
feel
throughout
with
a
thinning
effect
on
the
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
shortlived
with
some
of
the
toffee
and
roasted
characteristics
shining
through
the
finish
is
quick
and
clean
leaving
a
clear
palate
behind
c
o
will
drink
this
one
again
whimsical
label
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
if
i
were
you
and
i
dont
plan
on
having
it
again
bottom
line
this
is
a
dull
boring
beer
that
lacks
flavor
poured
a
clear
amber
medium
white
head
aroma
and
taste
is
a
light
fruitiness
some
toasted
malt
and
grains
and
a
bit
of
grassy
notes
a
medium
body
carbonation
is
moderate
finish
is
some
toasted
malt
barley
yeast
light
fruity
and
grassy
notes
and
some
light
hops
overall
seems
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
just
an
average
brew
do
drinkability
is
moderately
low
this
beer
has
a
nice
vision
but
strays
away
from
the
path
too
erratically
for
me
to
fully
get
behind
it
the
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
in
the
taste
replaced
with
a
strange
malt
bill
and
sweetness
ill
leave
this
as
a
novelty
beer
fun
to
try
once
but
i
will
not
seek
this
out
again
o
a
beer
that
is
some
what
out
of
balance
and
has
a
large
amounts
of
yeastmusty
smell
and
tast
that
over
takes
the
rest
of
the
flavors
in
the
beer
o
an
easydrinking
beer
i
could
see
putting
several
of
these
down
at
a
time
originally
i
had
this
one
scored
lower
but
then
i
read
more
about
diacetyl
and
how
it
is
an
acceptable
aspect
in
an
english
bitter
o
if
this
were
strictly
novelty
it
would
be
impressive
but
i
think
they
were
shooting
for
a
serious
beer
i
wish
this
was
a
bit
more
pulled
together
because
it
does
have
good
flavor
it
it
just
seems
a
little
all
over
the
place
o
not
impressed
maybe
it
would
be
better
for
people
who
appreciate
the
nostalgia
from
the
monty
python
movie
but
i
dont
care
for
it
and
will
definitely
not
buy
this
beer
again
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
is
light
and
simple
theres
nothing
intriguing
here
poured
this
english
pale
ale
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
produced
a
very
nice
white
head
very
nice
retention
and
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
pale
ale
contained
citrus
hops
herbs
and
fruit
the
ale
is
medium
in
body
with
the
flavor
of
sweet
grain
sour
apple
and
bitter
hops
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
this
ale
was
ok
okay
session
beer
but
nothing
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
again
says
to
serve
cool
so
i
did
it
has
the
color
of
copper
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
didnt
notice
any
carbonation
aroma
and
taste
are
the
exact
same
a
faint
grassgrain
with
a
hint
of
malt
its
rather
underwhelming
in
flavor
aroma
but
it
is
an
ok
beer
its
a
fine
grassy
flavor
just
weak
very
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
not
bitter
at
all
a
little
dry
afterfinish
nothing
really
special
but
a
decent
beer
get
rid
of
that
weird
funk
so
those
hops
can
shine
through
and
make
the
mouth
feel
creamier
and
less
astringent
and
this
would
be
a
decent
pale
notes
my
100th
beer
review
meh
not
bad
easy
drinking
not
expensive
and
an
abv
5
make
this
a
sessionable
if
uninspired
ale
could
do
worse
merely
a
flesh
wound
o
i
have
no
idea
if
this
bottle
is
old
or
what
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
is
at
its
prime
pretty
average
beer
if
its
free
go
for
it
but
if
not
there
are
definitely
better
options
overall
it
was
an
ok
beer
but
not
really
for
me
it
was
drinkable
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
o
this
is
a
decent
english
pale
oits
ok
not
bad
at
all
mostly
got
it
as
homage
to
one
of
my
favourite
movies
you
have
to
spell
with
ou
as
well
o
decent
english
pale
ale
thought
this
beer
would
be
a
gimmicky
beer
but
it
was
pretty
decent
reviewed

cst
rather
nice
worth
trying
overall
this
is
very
good
for
being
a
pale
ale
o
maybe
the
bottle
i
tried
all
those
months
ago
wasnt
so
fresh
this
was
better
than
i
remembered
it
being
and
the
tinny
scent
from
the
one
i
had
in
july
was
not
present
its
still
kind
of
a
gimmicky
brew
but
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
of
nothing
really
spectacular
tastes
wise
i
think
of
it
more
as
a
novelty
beer
perhaps
it
may
taste
better
fresh
from
the
brewery
it
is
a
shame
but
i
think
the
trip
across
the
pond
really
does
a
number
on
these
english
beers
light
transparent
yellow
color
with
shortlived
one
finger
head
very
mild
biscuity
scent
with
a
vague
nuttiness
and
light
whispers
of
floral
hop
scent
tastes
rather
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
wee
touch
of
citric
hoppiness
medium
bodied
inoffensive
but
also
somewhat
generic
im
probably
not
going
to
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
because
in
my
book
it
is
the
very
definition
of
the
word
average
o
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
not
much
to
smell
or
look
at
though
pours
a
light
golden
color
good
head
retention
with
some
lacing
at
first
the
taste
of
a
slightly
bitter
grain
but
after
i
swallowed
i
noticed
a
distinct
sweet
fruitiness
almost
like
sweet
grapes
theres
a
subtle
bitterness
and
its
just
a
little
watery
good
but
not
great
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
it
other
than
the
title
d
overall
not
bad
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
i
started
to
like
it
but
it
really
wasnt
a
beer
i
was
fond
of
i
would
pass
on
this
as
its
really
struggling
to
figure
out
its
identity
is
it
a
ale
or
lager
stay
away
from
this
jackalhyde
drama
overall
this
is
really
smooth
and
actually
pretty
tasty
the
balance
is
really
nice
you
get
a
bit
of
everything
with
it
only
draw
back
is
its
not
a
big
beer
the
flavor
isnt
over
the
top
strong
this
is
pretty
mild
but
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
enjoy
really
impressed
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
clear
golden
color
body
and
has
a
nice
2
white
cramy
head
that
lays
down
quickly
to
a
lace
around
the
top
of
the
body
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
some
malts
the
taste
is
balanced
well
between
the
hops
and
malts
i
get
a
little
lemon
and
some
spice
coming
through
to
this
beer
has
a
good
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
good
beer
othis
is
an
okay
beer
i
prefer
my
beers
to
be
bigger
and
have
a
thicker
mouthfeel
this
one
was
just
a
bit
too
creamy
for
me
eh
to
hell
with
it
just
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
its
not
bad
the
aroma
is
malty
but
a
bit
hoppy
there
was
not
much
head
to
it
i
would
say
about
a
finger
and
the
carbonation
in
the
body
was
thin
the
body
itself
was
golden
it
is
mainly
a
malty
beer
with
a
well
hopped
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
slick
it
wasnt
bad
i
would
expect
more
for
the
price
i
had
been
a
fan
of
the
monty
python
since
i
was
in
7th
grade
so
when
i
came
across
this
i
had
to
try
it
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
typical
golden
color
with
soapy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
smell
like
an
esb
lots
of
malts
and
grains
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
solid
bitterness
to
it
with
a
semisweet
flavor
in
the
mix
too
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
had
a
pretty
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
and
was
just
a
bit
lighter
than
medium
bodied
overall
i
found
this
ale
to
be
enjoyable
and
would
probably
have
it
again
one
day
overall
a
decent
quaffable
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
backed
by
a
nice
punch
of
carbonation
not
to
much
but
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
acidity
a
really
a
nice
session
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
joy
to
drink
bluh
summary
overall
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
balanced
a
neutral
choice
which
could
be
a
disappoint
to
some
but
if
youre
in
the
right
mood
this
is
a
good
ale
choice
light
bodied
but
not
thin
slightly
creamy
overall
a
great
session
beer
easy
to
drink
summer
guzzler
i
have
to
admit
that
i
boosted
its
overall
grade
simply
because
i
have
an
affinity
for
monty
python
if
i
tried
this
in
a
blind
taste
it
would
be
the
one
i
always
forgot
about
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
definitely
drinkable
but
theres
nothing
to
set
it
apart
this
was
an
enjoyable
selection
but
nothing
spectacular
there
are
other
ales
that
i
prefer
over
this
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
good
beer
could
be
better
if
there
was
a
bit
more
going
on
pretty
hoppy
nose
floral
maybe
a
bit
earthy
is
that
the
burning
witches
flavor
is
utterly
nondescript
not
bad
not
good
as
others
have
mentioned
feels
like
95
a
monty
python
gimmick
theres
waaaay
to
many
beers
out
there
to
be
drinking
gimmicks
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
to
drink
but
one
id
hand
off
to
my
buddies
who
appreciate
monty
python
showsmovies
absolutely
underwhelming
nice
novelty
for
monty
python
fans
but
beer
fans
will
want
to
avoid
this
one
otherwise
i
was
genuinely
surprised
to
see
the
group
score
on
this
was
so
high
poured
a
12
soap
suds
head
which
quickly
dissipated
to
nothing
hazy
tea
color
smell
had
a
hint
of
skunk
but
also
a
little
hops
and
malt
in
it
very
mild
ale
in
flavor
but
theres
a
little
caramel
really
a
thoroughly
average
beer
to
me
and
my
sample
says
its
from
rochester
ny
so
its
not
like
it
genuinely
was
imported
anyway
fun
name
but
id
say
you
buy
this
once
due
to
the
label
and
then
move
on
to
other
things
overall
had
this
before
with
better
luck
but
this
one
is
flawed
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
way
overpriced
its
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
sunny
day
but
its
pretty
much
just
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
i
have
had
much
better
pale
ales
and
this
one
was
ok
to
sample
but
not
really
the
full
cost
to
buy
a
whole
pint
still
very
cool
of
carnivores
to
do
flights
for
beers
like
this
so
you
dont
throw
down
5
bucks
for
something
you
didnt
love
pretty
good
beer
cheers
12
ounce
bottle
bought
as
a
single
at
world
market
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
good
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
ia
bready
malt
grassy
hops
dried
fruit
and
some
butterscotch
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
it
seems
a
bit
weak
compared
to
the
aroma
and
theres
also
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
a
bit
crisp
and
has
good
carbonation
i
think
its
an
average
overall
brew
worth
trying
if
you
can
buy
it
as
a
single
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
a
4
or
6
pack
of
this
to
drink
by
myself
overall
great
session
beer
here
enough
flavour
to
keep
a
guy
interested
but
light
and
crisp
enough
to
drink
a
bunch
drinkability
id
drink
one
just
to
say
i
had
one
you
know
it
being
monty
python
and
all
but
i
dont
see
myself
ever
going
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
another
poured
a
clear
light
brown
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
dissapated
quickly
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
pleasant
with
the
scent
of
caramel
malts
a
sweet
yeast
and
a
mild
grassy
hop
it
tasted
mildly
sweet
in
the
beginning
and
finished
about
the
same
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
hops
with
the
flavor
being
very
light
and
fading
quickly
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
very
very
mild
tasting
brew
i
think
i
like
the
name
better
than
the
beer
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
an
easydrinking
monty
python
themed
beer
if
you
like
both
of
those
things
this
is
definitely
the
beer
for
you
its
just
a
damn
good
beer
like
the
holy
grail
it
cannot
be
described
only
experienced
i
purchased
this
at
a
local
beer
superstore
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
movies
and
the
bottle
caught
my
eye
immediately
i
chilled
a
mug
and
poured
it
from
the
bottle
into
the
mug
the
first
thing
i
noticed
is
a
nice
color
it
a
light
rust
color
then
as
i
smelled
it
i
couldnt
wait
any
longer
to
drink
it
it
went
down
smooth
with
a
little
bite
in
the
after
taste
after
i
took
one
drink
i
couldnt
wait
to
drink
more
i
drank
six
of
them
that
night
while
watching
a
football
game
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
will
purchase
it
again
i
bought
the
beer
because
i
like
monty
python
and
i
could
see
a
sixpack
of
this
going
quite
well
with
a
movie
marathon
drinks
pretty
well
a
very
nice
brew
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
is
far
from
good
or
even
adequate
d
i
have
never
drain
poured
a
beer
as
i
always
try
to
find
something
redeeming
i
know
just
because
i
dont
particularly
care
for
something
doesnt
mean
it
is
bad
but
this
was
close
honestly
if
someone
handed
me
one
i
would
drink
it
but
if
they
asked
before
hand
if
i
wanted
them
to
get
me
one
i
would
turn
it
down
there
is
nothing
overly
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
is
a
constant
disappointment
at
every
turn
honestly
i
would
save
the
for
something
else
monty
pythons
holy
grail
ale
has
a
light
orange
colour
and
a
crappy
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
smell
is
slightly
bitter
and
yeastygrainy
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
clean
slightly
musty
finish
its
quite
carbonated
so
it
has
good
presence
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
decent
and
very
drinkable
but
nothing
exceptional
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
d
nice
taste
and
a
good
mouthfeel
and
aroma
results
in
a
very
sessionable
brew
that
being
said
i
feel
i
can
do
better
d
this
is
an
entirely
unremarkable
english
ale
not
bad
by
any
means
but
absolutely
nothing
about
it
really
jumps
out
at
me
the
entire
time
i
was
drinking
it
i
was
thinking
this
tastes
like
beer
i
almost
want
to
buy
another
one
to
see
if
i
notice
anything
that
i
missed
the
first
time
through
d
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
has
a
mild
spicy
bitter
taste
with
hints
of
cinnamon
has
nice
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
drink
on
a
cold
winter
night
i
think
the
knights
of
ni
would
appreciate
a
pint
of
this
not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
but
at
the
same
time
i
wouldnt
mind
having
if
it
were
on
offer
at
lets
say
a
party
or
gettogether
drinkability
obviously
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
is
okay
i
might
drink
it
again
but
it
would
have
to
be
another
free
bottle
i
was
looking
for
a
nice
tasty
treat
that
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
and
this
was
a
good
choice
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
so
i
wasnt
disappointed
this
is
ok
as
a
monty
python
fanatic
had
to
try
this
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
showed
a
light
amber
yellow
with
frothhy
white
head
little
retention
and
lacing
smelled
earthy
with
some
sweet
malts
taste
bready
up
front
then
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweet
malts
medium
carbonation
lightmedium
body
but
still
fairly
tasty
good
session
brew
d
this
is
an
okay
ale
fairly
typical
to
the
style
not
amazing
but
tastes
good
an
easily
enjoyed
brew
youll
want
more
than
one
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
thanks
to
the
low
abv
which
is
nigh
undetectable
nonexistent
bitterness
and
pleasing
if
fleeting
taste
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
a
solid
brew
with
an
interesting
theme
it
still
didnt
tell
me
what
the
airspeed
of
an
unladen
swallow
is
though
might
have
to
dock
it
a
few
points
for
that
true
to
style
good
session
beer
looking
forward
to
the
life
of
brian
to
come
out
hopefully
made
with
wolf
nipple
chips
d
refreshing
and
low
in
abv
d
definitely
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
nice
english
ale
further
notes
unless
youve
already
got
one
the
search
for
the
holy
grail
ale
is
not
a
bad
idea
if
you
want
something
on
the
cheap
side
english
tasting
sessionable
and
like
monty
python
i
was
impressed
to
find
more
than
a
cheap
gimmick
albeit
one
i
loved
to
this
beer
its
not
a
top
notch
pale
but
its
still
quite
good

edit
two
years
later
i
can
confirm
my
initial
review
i
am
altering
nothing
but
the
letter
d
to
o
and
the
rating
from
4
to
2
5
there
is
a
light
english
ale
fruitiness
in
the
maintaste
unmentioned
in
my
initial
review
d
drinks
rather
nicely
on
a
hot
summer
night
a
lot
higher
quality
than
i
was
expecting
drinkability
4
out
of
5
i
didnt
expect
a
marketing
gimmick
like
this
to
be
so
delicious
considering
its
overall
lightness
and
low
abv
it
would
be
a
victory
for
beer
drinkers
everywhere
if
monty
pythons
holy
grail
ale
replaced
the
trashy
light
beers
on
tap
around
america
one
could
definitely
make
a
session
with
this
beer
as
its
hard
not
to
quaff
m
d
its
wet
and
sweet
and
frankly
stale
tasting
im
sure
this
is
way
past
its
prime
and
this
review
would
be
patently
unfair
save
for
the
fact
that
there
is
simply
no
way
to
tell
how
old
the
bottle
is
monty
python
comedy
is
alright
but
if
youre
going
to
use
the
name
and
logo
on
your
beer
is
it
too
much
to
ask
that
you
make
an
effort
to
put
your
best
product
forward
apparently
it
is
disappointing
and
left
unfinished
do
not
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
this
beer
unless
you
have
it
on
good
authority
that
it
is
fresh
to
this
beer
i
say
ni
overall
this
is
honestly
not
a
bad
beer
i
have
had
much
worse
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
do
recommend
to
give
it
a
try
at
least
once
d
definitely
more
drinkable
than
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
would
lead
me
to
believe
its
good
to
sit
back
and
have
a
few
of
great
conversation
piece
too
i
tried
this
beer
on
november
27
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
reddishgold
with
a
bubbly
tan
coloured
head
and
plenty
of
effervescence
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
skunky
and
not
at
all
appealing
definitely
an
esb
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
despite
the
effervescence
the
flavour
is
bitter
with
some
grain
and
citrus
notes
thrown
in
i
would
possibly
drink
this
again
its
not
my
first
choice
as
english
ales
rarely
are
but
its
definitely
quaffable
i
expected
something
much
worse
considering
the
cheesy
monty
python
theme
tried
again
in
2012
seems
a
bit
more
dialed
in
light
biscuit
honey
and
lavender
flavor
carbonation
is
tamer
still
not
great
but
decent
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
hope
to
drink
more
in
the
future
it
seems
to
be
more
on
par
with
samuel
smiths
pale
ale
than
bass
pale
ale
it
just
has
a
higher
quality
feel
to
it
i
highly
recommend
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
session
beer
the
4
7
abv
sits
well
within
the
brew
and
i
thought
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
ill
be
having
more
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
but
because
this
brew
leaves
no
challenge
for
the
pallet
at
all
and
stirs
no
excitement
for
me
to
buy
it
again
i
had
to
give
it
a
2
5
for
drinkability
the
fact
that
the
bottle
had
monty
python
on
the
label
it
was
safe
to
assume
it
was
from
the
uk
or
at
least
a
british
style
pale
ale
that
is
exactly
what
i
found
in
the
nose
fruit
bready
yeast
maybe
some
butter
a
splash
of
alcohol
and
a
dash
of
hops
the
earthy
spicy
kind
the
taste
fit
to
what
i
had
smelled
and
been
preparing
for
very
english
toffee
caramel
toasted
bread
the
finish
leaves
a
sweet
buttery
coating
on
the
tongue
that
quickly
passes
the
thin
body
and
medium
carbonation
make
the
holy
ail
an
easy
drinker
so
go
ahead
and
grab
a
sixer
the
brew
is
quite
good
not
just
a
gimmick
d
tried
this
one
for
the
bottle
it
tastes
far
too
much
like
a
bad
brown
ale
for
me
to
want
to
drink
it
again
much
too
sweet
and
slick
for
my
tastes
im
not
exactly
going
to
be
running
back
for
more
body
is
light
carbonation
is
fairly
light
as
well
watery
feel
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
overall
theres
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
nor
anything
really
awful
either
its
relatively
cheap
so
probably
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
otherwise
its
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
very
good
clear
amber
color
head
lacing
like
a
champ
super
tasty
brew
toasty
malts
balanced
very
well
with
the
bitter
end
went
down
smooth
and
satisfactorily
a
most
excellent
pair
with
my
fish
sandwich
delicious
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
another
one
i
think
the
beer
is
much
better
when
cold
and
not
as
good
as
it
warms
up
which
i
think
is
odd
for
an
english
ale
but
im
not
complaining
for
an
ale
it
also
has
some
lagerlike
qualities
at
times
but
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
regretted
ordering
this
one
this
beer
doesnt
do
justice
to
the
group
it
attempts
to
honor
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
a
style
which
i
am
not
particularly
a
fan
of
its
not
hugely
flavorful
but
it
is
very
smooth
which
i
suppose
was
the
goal
all
in
all
its
an
all
right
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
drink
again
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
worst
craft
brews
ive
ever
tasted
ive
had
it
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
before
but
nothings
changed
d
did
not
feel
myself
wanting
another
sip
of
this
beer
very
often
other
than
to
make
sure
that
i
was
correct
in
my
assessment
of
it
maybe
this
was
a
bad
batch
of
it
i
will
have
to
revisit
just
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
cool
bottle
though
doesnt
hurt
that
im
a
monty
python
fan
but
this
is
a
below
average
beer
sullying
the
name
of
a
funny
comedy
troupe
d
a
nice
brew
id
have
another
i
got
this
beer
in
a
cleveland
hotel
bar
it
was
this
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
it
on
draft
so
i
decided
to
get
it
the
beer
is
as
one
would
expect
golden
in
color
with
a
head
that
easily
dissipates
the
smell
is
all
malt
with
no
hint
of
hops
the
first
sip
is
sweet
with
slight
carbonation
that
never
dominates
overall
this
beer
is
average
for
malt
lovers
theirs
plenty
of
malt
but
nothing
for
the
hop
lover
in
me
this
is
a
traditional
english
pale
good
but
not
great
d
not
very
good
d
certainly
drinkable
at
4
7
though
i
think
my
taste
buds
would
grow
tired
of
the
unfortunate
blandness
long
before
my
liver
gave
up
the
quest
to
this
beer
i
say
ni
ni
ni
all
in
all
this
beer
starts
off
good
but
definitely
does
not
deliver
not
worth
hunting
down
let
this
one
go
the
body
was
the
highlight
of
the
beer
not
that
thats
saying
much
but
the
sharp
creamy
body
was
nice
other
than
that
im
not
impressed
its
probably
safe
to
say
my
quest
for
the
holy
grail
ended
in
disappointment
d
over
all
this
beer
is
simply
well
simple
but
not
in
the
way
that
keeps
the
best
english
pas
wellrounded
but
still
pleasing
i
think
that
this
beers
saving
grace
would
be
that
it
would
probably
be
decent
to
pair
with
most
foods
a
fair
attempt
at
the
style
buoyed
mainly
by
the
kitsch
of
the
name
would
definitely
recommend
this
ale
great
with
chicken
and
suspecet
it
may
be
good
with
pork
too
notes
well
balanced
but
fairly
subtle
flavors
kind
of
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
but
its
a
decent
british
session
beer
other
than
the
novelty
factor
i
probably
wouldnt
search
for
this
specifically
but
it
may
be
worth
a
try
i
got
this
in
a
mixasix
at
lakewood
spirits
unlimited
i
poured
this
into
a
sam
smith
nonic
appearance
is
a
golden
colour
with
fizzy
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
very
grainy
smell
and
the
taste
is
somewhat
malty
with
a
light
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
light
and
this
is
not
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
tasted
d
great
good
standard
sessionable
beer
ill
remember
this
one
d
surprisingly
refreshing
drinking
this
beer
compared
to
its
american
counterpart
this
is
definitely
a
lot
more
quaffable
which
isnt
too
surprising
due
to
the
low
abv
overall
i
thought
it
was
ok
but
nothing
too
exciting
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
barley
and
nutty
malt
with
sweet
and
creamy
yeast
and
some
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
nutty
and
light
caramel
malt
with
creamy
yeast
and
some
copper
hops
it
was
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
very
basic
taste
but
it
was
clean
and
decent
the
body
was
passable
so
the
beer
was
no
problem
to
drink
however
thats
not
a
strong
compliment
aside
from
the
name
this
beer
is
totally
forgettable
at
least
it
wasnt
offensive
to
try
it
was
an
easytodrink
light
pale
ale
nothing
fabulous
but
nothing
to
knock
down
either
i
had
tried
this
beer
once
before
and
not
liked
it
but
i
found
it
pretty
good
the
second
time
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
d
alright
maybe
its
the
style
but
i
did
not
particularly
care
for
it
boring
overall
i
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
bubblegum
flavor
its
really
off
putting
and
not
very
pleasant
really
though
its
one
of
my
favorite
movies
of
all
time
so
i
just
got
it
for
the
bottle
the
whole
thing
is
not
a
game
changer
and
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
like
the
killer
rabbit
but
it
is
a
solid
session
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
very
sessionable
mouthfeel
was
light
a
bit
flat
drinkability
is
very
good
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
i
think
i
perfer
tap
overall
a
bit
boring
drinkability
an
easy
beer
to
knock
back
and
a
fine
one
to
toast
a
job
well
done
thanks
lori
drinkability
good
for
the
style
but
not
great
overall
this
has
a
very
smooth
and
nice
biscuit
taste
i
could
have
two
max
very
drinkable
good
beer
and
one
i
avoided
for
a
while
now
with
regret
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
crystalclear
amber
body
with
a
good
inch
of
shortlived
offwhite
head
smells
biscuity
with
hints
of
nut
and
hay
tastes
malty
for
sure
with
hints
of
nut
biscuit
butter
and
herbal
hops
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
pleasant
drinkable
subtle
brew
not
horrible
but
not
much
going
on
here
really
similar
to
bass
in
many
way
not
bad
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
not
too
heavy
on
hops
very
sessionable
definitely
something
id
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
drinkability
a
decent
drink
for
something
i
honestly
just
picked
up
for
the
novelty
of
the
label
little
did
i
know
that
someone
actually
put
some
work
into
making
this
beer
tasty
try
it
subtle
interesting
complexity
as
i
would
expect
from
a
true
english
pale
ale
worth
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
i
was
pleased
with
this
brew
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
more
than
just
a
gimmick
however
with
so
many
different
styles
and
brands
out
there
this
wont
be
one
i
seek
out
again
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
light
copper
color
with
small
quickly
diminishing
head
smells
of
flowers
with
a
hint
of
citrus
thin
drink
with
lively
carbonation
finishes
slightly
dull
and
bland
i
was
hoping
for
some
of
the
flower
and
citrus
to
translate
but
it
did
not
interesting
choice
for
name
and
label
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
d
to
me
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
its
just
average
to
me
seems
like
a
novelty
pretty
much
the
only
reason
i
got
it
was
because
the
bar
was
selling
it
with
its
ceramic
goblet
theres
better
englih
pales
out
there
the
taste
is
lightly
caramelly
bread
dough
and
grain
hint
of
apple
a
bit
sweet
with
light
leafygrassy
bitterness
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
lemon
right
at
the
finish
i
previously
had
noted
light
lemonycitrusyleafy
bitterness
toasty
bread
with
hints
of
caramel
and
fruit
it
is
pleasant
but
a
bit
thin
and
barely
noticeable
as
an
actual
english
ale
feel
is
pretty
good
solid
but
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
and
nothing
particularly
great
and
now
for
something
completely
different
t
tastes
very
basic
like
a
lager
not
really
an
ale
it
is
crisp
but
with
little
flavor
sells
off
its
name
more
than
its
taste
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
love
it
ill
certainly
have
it
again
though
it
is
a
refreshing
subtle
beer
that
wont
challenge
but
also
wont
offend
tends
to
get
overwhelmed
by
food
though
so
stick
with
lighter
fare
when
enjoying
this
brew
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
the
smell
is
of
generic
grains
cereal
and
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
an
apple
like
smell
the
taste
is
very
crisp
a
sweet
apple
taste
is
in
there
with
some
easy
malt
grains
and
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
that
is
very
small
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
not
overly
complex
but
very
smooth
and
refreshing
not
bad
in
its
own
right
kind
of
a
novelty
a
one
time
purchase
for
me
a
dark
orangeamber
color
pour
with
a
medium
sized
rocky
white
head
some
light
lacing
left
behind
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
flavor
is
of
caramel
malt
ripe
apple
and
a
bit
of
hops
lightly
bitter
short
fruity
finish
a
crisp
mouthfeel
medium
body
a
good
try
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
to
bring
me
back
for
another
quite
sessionable
d
would
definitely
reach
for
a
second
if
i
had
one
on
hand
this
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
12
finger
of
of
fluffy
white
head
head
retains
rather
well
and
leaves
some
decent
sticky
lacing
nose
is
of
grains
grassiness
some
sweet
fruits
and
a
bit
of
a
malt
character
taste
is
well
balanced
nothing
overpowering
or
stands
out
some
grassiness
hits
you
up
front
grains
and
breadiness
hit
the
middle
with
a
sweet
malaty
character
at
the
end
lighter
side
of
medium
body
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
goes
down
rather
smooth
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
to
it
but
it
doesnt
linger
all
that
long
this
is
one
to
sit
with
for
a
night
nothing
jumps
out
but
well
done
and
easy
to
sit
with
a
full
flavored
ale
decent
bitterness
with
notes
of
roasted
malt
very
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
no
sacrifice
on
taste
carbonation
is
a
little
heavy
but
would
probably
be
tempered
on
cask
if
its
available
mid
level
abv
makes
this
an
option
for
session
drinking
aside
from
the
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
ale
recommended
something
about
this
was
really
good
i
loved
the
flavor
of
this
beer
super
drinkable
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
interesting
flavor
good
citrus
flavor
with
some
pine
from
hops
it
wasnt
very
carbonated
but
thats
fine
by
me
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
i
highly
recommend
this
if
you
want
a
drinkable
beer
thats
different
than
the
from
the
usual
overall
a
easy
drinking
pale
ale
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
copper
with
a
smallish
eggshell
head
that
disappears
without
leaving
much
of
a
trace
smells
of
typical
english
malt
thats
to
say
sweet
bready
and
with
some
caramel
light
hop
character
very
mild
taste
with
straightforward
boring
malt
character
again
taking
the
lead
hard
to
find
any
sign
of
hopping
here
nothing
really
floral
nothing
citric
no
pronounced
bitterness
medium
body
nothing
special
though
im
wondering
how
old
this
bottle
is
like
a
good
pale
ale
it
was
nice
and
rounded
balanced
with
a
decent
spice
background
notesoverall
i
have
to
say
i
was
surprised
when
i
reached
for
it
i
had
a
choice
of
the
old
reliables
at
my
local
beer
warehouse
it
was
a
sort
of
whatthehell
choice
and
in
the
end
a
good
one
a
surprise
pretty
danged
good
pours
a
clear
copperorange
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
grain
pale
malt
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
english
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
up
front
then
grain
slight
sweet
malt
paledry
hops
and
some
yeast
cleanliness
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
with
good
drinkability
drinkability
easy
to
drink
epa
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
would
love
to
have
this
at
a
pub
in
england
instead
of
bottled
at
home
d
not
exactly
the
most
exciting
beer
around
but
a
sturdy
drinkable
english
pale
ale
this
would
be
very
sessionable
solid
malt
is
definitely
there
on
the
palate
thick
and
sticky
with
a
biscuity
kind
of
sweetness
thick
and
full
mouthfeel
hops
are
there
in
their
earthy
tart
goodness
but
finish
is
grainy
like
cereal
with
a
brown
sugar
kind
of
flavour
to
it
that
somehow
manages
to
reemerge
after
the
hops
have
done
their
lingering
magic
hence
very
very
back
of
the
palate
is
somehow
quite
sweet
although
for
the
most
part
a
slight
lemongrass
bitterness
is
prevalent
not
a
bad
english
ale
apart
from
that
lingering
sweetness
theres
nothing
unusual
about
it
taste
is
a
bit
plain
overall
could
well
be
used
as
a
cleanser
though
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
than
the
gimmick
d
an
easy
beer
to
throw
back
however
the
tartness
takes
away
from
how
many
i
could
put
down
tm
smooth
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
florida
summers
day
starts
sweet
and
tart
with
a
slow
transition
to
the
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
d
decent
beer
not
one
of
the
best
but
not
too
bad
overall
not
an
impressive
beer
but
the
name
is
cool
so
you
figure
you
need
to
try
it
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
somewhat
watery
i
appreciate
the
light
flavor
as
its
over
eighty
degrees
outside
but
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
more
flavorful
there
is
so
little
flavor
with
this
beer
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
macro
lager
nothing
at
all
special
about
it
its
very
drinkable
and
i
could
see
it
possibly
being
a
gateway
beer
but
it
is
substandard
when
compared
to
sam
adams
boston
ale
or
lager
ive
seen
this
on
the
shelf
for
years
and
never
tried
it
now
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
more
of
it
taste
is
very
smooth
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
although
the
taste
is
fairly
limited
in
its
complexity
some
rind
added
to
the
mix
is
nice
though
bring
out
your
dead
cause
this
one
is
actually
pretty
good
i
expected
some
halfassed
novelty
beer
to
taste
like
shit
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
not
bad
it
really
is
a
true
crowd
pleaser
as
well
meaning
your
nonbeer
geek
friends
would
enjoy
it
at
the
memorial
day
picnic
and
would
be
overwhelmed
its
a
tad
more
malty
and
a
touch
more
bitter
than
say
a
heinekenwith
an
ale
taste
of
course
but
not
too
bad
very
clean
hey
its
a
drinkable
beer
i
just
wonder
if
this
is
simply
a
plonk
some
branding
on
the
beer
beer
relatively
light
and
while
not
terrible
exciting
it
goes
down
well
enough
not
a
great
beer
not
by
a
long
shot
but
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
for
such
a
gimmick
i
definitely
dont
begrudge
the
buck
pours
a
honey
color
with
a
short
head
quickly
fading
with
a
minimal
lace
slightly
fruity
nose
with
a
biscuit
malt
taste
and
not
much
else
mouthfeel
weak
watery
carbonation
was
good
tight
and
crisp
thats
the
best
i
can
say
for
this
beer
its
a
pass
by
in
the
store
i
bought
it
for
the
novelty
of
the
name
i
suppose
black
sheep
was
banking
on
this
the
movie
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
i
laugh
at
it
all
the
time
the
beer
not
so
much
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
little
less
of
a
bitterness
than
expected
refreshing
and
crisp
it
does
have
nice
drinkability
and
can
be
quite
refreshing
had
this
at
the
houston
flying
saucer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appears
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
malty
and
fruity
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
orange
lemon
and
some
honey
fruity
in
the
taste
with
some
light
spice
and
with
the
hop
bitterness
lightly
kicking
in
the
end
very
easy
to
drink
will
definately
try
again
easy
to
drink
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
more
pronounced
i
think
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
overall
good
a
decent
session
beer
d
went
down
smooth
i
could
finish
one
but
i
dont
know
about
more
than
that
d
not
bad
given
the
light
heft
and
basic
blandness
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
its
not
an
offensive
beer
its
just
not
an
interesting
or
enjoyable
experience
to
drink
this
one
d
you
know
i
dont
think
id
ever
buy
this
if
something
a
little
more
interesting
were
available
but
if
someone
brought
a
huge
case
over
and
forced
me
to
drink
it
i
wouldnt
object
in
the
slightest
im
probably
drinking
this
in
the
wrong
season
itd
be
a
perfect
summer
ale
and
its
perfectly
sessionable
d
clean
and
light
enough
to
drink
alot
of
after
getting
through
about
half
the
glass
though
the
stickiness
gets
to
you
overall
nice
bottle
shame
about
the
beer
a
very
dull
ale
as
others
have
noted
this
is
a
typical
english
pale
ale
it
is
a
wellcrafted
brew
with
no
obvious
defects
positives
to
note
are
the
lovely
creamy
head
a
noticeable
floral
aroma
a
smooth
wellbalanced
flavor
with
definiite
hop
presence
but
not
so
as
to
overpower
the
malt
the
complexity
and
balance
of
the
caramel
malt
and
hops
are
such
that
this
ale
keeps
ones
interest
over
time
while
not
overpowering
the
pallete
could
easily
sip
on
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
final
thoughts
this
isnt
exactly
a
beer
you
buy
more
then
once
you
buy
it
because
you
see
the
monty
python
reference
get
a
laugh
and
say
youll
give
it
a
shot
its
pretty
good
and
a
bit
interesting
but
its
nothing
exceptional
i
certainly
didnt
feel
cheated
but
its
not
such
a
standout
that
its
worth
a
second
purchase
on
a
side
note
i
dont
think
im
getting
enough
burning
witch
flavor
offwhite
head
and
a
clear
copperorange
body
the
aroma
is
very
floral
and
a
little
fruity
taste
is
mainly
of
the
floral
hops
tiny
amount
of
diacetyl
as
well
the
aftertaste
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
skin
of
an
apple
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
d
quite
drinkable
i
didnt
sense
anything
particularly
special
in
this
but
it
was
still
nice
golden
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
fruity
taste
is
breadyfruity
with
a
hint
of
caramel
or
toffee
overall
a
beer
that
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
bad
either
i
personally
would
buy
again
and
would
recommend
for
someone
to
try
at
least
once
this
beer
was
decent
overall
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
they
are
drinkable
though
and
with
an
under
5
abv
you
could
easily
drink
more
of
these
not
bad
but
not
great
either
drinkability
blah
is
what
i
wrote
as
i
reviewed
i
guess
that
means
low
maybe
i
just
got
a
pull
off
an
old
keg
but
this
one
wont
be
on
my
list
to
try
again
served
in
a
mug
at
a
local
pizza
joint
this
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
both
the
aroma
and
taste
were
subtle
to
say
the
least
very
faint
caramel
sweet
fruit
biscuit
nothing
really
stood
out
still
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
one
could
probably
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
drinkability
not
much
goin
on
here
but
at
4
7
thats
ok
just
a
reasonably
balanced
simple
straightforward
brew
cant
say
itd
be
a
go
to
for
me
its
not
really
my
style
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
wont
knock
it
for
that
its
pretty
smooth
with
good
carbonation
certainly
worth
the
try
d
decent
flavor
with
a
nice
clean
finish
no
funky
aftertastes
surprisingly
good
though
it
is
decent
or
a
little
better
it
seems
more
to
be
reaching
for
monty
python
fans
than
to
be
a
great
beer
i
might
revisit
it
just
to
tell
everyone
i
found
the
holy
grail
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
but
there
is
some
smells
of
apples
mostly
the
taste
is
the
same
green
apple
tartness
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
very
nice
hoppy
finish
its
a
bit
thin
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
most
excellent
and
deserving
of
the
python
pedigree
also
i
loved
the
python
art
work
on
the
lable
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
bud
light
seems
more
like
a
gimmick
than
a
tasty
craft
beer
this
would
be
a
great
gift
for
someone
who
drinks
bmc
and
is
a
big
fan
on
monty
python
when
the
side
of
the
bottle
says
serve
cool
listen
to
it
on
this
one
this
is
an
ale
that
would
benefit
from
some
severe
icing
down
a
good
steady
pale
ale
not
mindblowing
but
certainly
not
bad
di
expected
more
after
the
nice
appearance
and
aroma
not
bad
though
o
considering
that
their
name
is
a
clever
marketing
ploy
i
wasnt
expecting
much
that
being
said
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
at
4
7
its
a
good
session
beer
not
the
most
complex
or
most
tremendous
beer
out
there
but
worth
a
drink
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
about
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
across
the
top
the
aroma
was
of
fruit
and
also
a
bit
yeasty
the
flavor
was
a
bit
fruity
and
was
balanced
by
the
hops
this
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
okay
but
forgettable
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
this
isnt
anything
special
the
packaging
was
what
initially
sold
me
and
it
turned
out
better
then
i
thought
but
its
not
great
overall
very
solid
english
pale
ale
not
too
bitter
and
pretty
drinkable
as
well
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beer
drinkable
through
the
abv
flavor
profiles
are
unique
and
would
serve
as
a
nice
changeup
from
other
pales
d
good
not
great
but
for
the
entertainment
value
worth
the
purchase
sit
back
and
put
on
the
holy
grail
and
have
a
good
time
with
a
good
beer
average
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
though
pours
an
amber
brown
colored
body
with
a
smallmedium
sized
head
good
sized
bubbles
and
good
lacing
but
diminishing
has
a
very
malty
aroma
some
hops
nutty
earthy
a
malty
dry
bitter
taste
lightly
acidic
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
good
flavor
pretty
decent
atmosphere
really
solid
for
this
style
in
my
opinion
overall
good
quaff
drinkability
style
is
just
like
a
typical
english
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
not
bad
but
definitely
not
a
favorite
nothing
so
special
here
nikki
future
outlook
decent
refreshing
ale
but
not
terribly
interesting
and
not
worth
the
premium
price
tag
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
gimmick
beer
but
i
picked
it
up
at
marsh
on
state
road
135
south
of
greenwood
they
have
a
little
section
where
you
can
make
your
own
sixer
for
8
99
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
you
should
try
it
on
it
fits
quite
nicely

ml
bottle
pours
a
golden
orangeamber
color
with
very
little
white
head
aroma
is
mainly
malts
grain
bread
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malts
resiny
hops
light
bodied
dry
flat
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
sort
of
indistinguishable
though
a
very
good
sessionable
ale
with
only
4
7
abv
nothing
outstanding
but
the
flavor
keeps
this
one
interesting
all
this
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
beer
d
a
great
pale
ale
wish
i
had
more
of
these
i
would
love
to
have
more
pours
golden
in
colour
thick
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
very
little
lacing
can
smell
some
citrus
and
caramel
not
that
much
carbonation
buttery
caramel
like
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
overall
it
was
a
smooth
well
balanced
beer
that
i
would
definately
have
again
drinkability
not
recommended
save
yourself
the
drain
pour
and
dodge
this
one
folks
mouthfeel
is
light
and
somewhat
watery
theres
no
complexity
to
speak
of
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
simple
session
beer
this
might
fit
your
needs
notes
i
ordered
this
the
glass
of
the
month
this
month
at
winking
lizard
with
a
bit
of
trepidation
but
it
proved
to
be
very
enjoyable
indeed
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
again
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
notes
a
good
session
brew
well
balanced
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
wont
be
trying
another
a
very
average
english
pale
ale
overall
i
was
suprised
that
the
beer
is
that
good
i
bought
it
only
because
i
am
a
fan
of
monthy
python
and
it
is
nice
that
it
is
drinkable
as
well
a
watery
mouthfeel
i
wasnt
too
impressed
by
this
just
a
typical
english
ipa
came
to
me
a
copperamber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
lacing
wasnt
to
be
seen
here
good
color
though
the
aroma
was
on
the
sweet
side
with
honey
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
lemon
zest
the
flavor
was
even
sweeter
and
the
lemony
citrus
was
more
prominent
there
was
some
herbal
hop
flavor
intertwining
with
the
sweetness
but
as
it
warmed
the
sweet
toffee
and
lemon
grew
stronger
and
less
enjoyable
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
this
is
one
i
had
never
seen
ontap
and
had
yet
to
try
so
i
couldnt
pass
it
up
but
i
will
for
now
on
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
wisp
of
head
has
a
faint
hop
smell
taste
is
very
crisp
and
theres
a
definite
apple
taste
to
it
each
sip
is
very
refreshing
and
the
apple
flavoring
adds
a
nice
little
touch
a
pretty
solid
english
pale
ale
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
brew
really
not
bad
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
mediumlight
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
finish
carbonation
is
delicate
and
is
not
over
the
top
in
my
opinion
its
level
is
just
near
perfect
it
compliments
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
quite
well
this
is
one
ill
definitely
pick
up
again
i
really
like
this
beer
its
turned
me
back
on
to
english
styles
unlike
some
of
the
english
ales
ive
had
this
one
is
not
packed
full
of
diacetyl
a
characteristic
i
dont
find
all
that
appealing
overall
a
well
made
beer
and
one
that
ill
give
another
go
round
to
at
first
pour
the
glass
smells
like
an
imported
lager
i
suppose
being
shipped
across
seas
in
the
summer
will
do
that
to
a
bear
after
a
little
time
its
warmed
up
and
i
get
a
crisp
grain
aroma
with
lemon
the
flavor
brings
out
more
of
the
lemon
and
herb
hops
in
the
aftertaste
and
mellow
malts
up
front
the
flavor
is
pretty
mellow
but
its
got
a
nice
finish
and
its
very
drinkable
the
witty
name
of
the
brew
drew
me
in
but
it
takes
more
than
a
name
to
bring
me
back
for
more
d
not
going
to
revisit
my
fridge
if
it
costs
2bottle
in
the
future
id
gladly
pay
8
5
for
the
six
pack
but
even
thats
pushing
it
simply
for
the
vanity
d
quaffable
very
easy
drinking
lightly
hopped
a
tad
on
the
boring
side
would
be
just
another
beer
if
not
for
the
monty
python
connection
poured
a
honey
orange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
was
honeylike
sweetness
taste
was
a
grainy
with
english
malts
mixed
with
some
honey
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
was
pretty
bland
and
not
that
good
overall
i
would
not
drink
again
many
b
etter
english
pales
out
there
pours
a
nice
light
copper
near
yellow
color
with
some
very
nice
head
and
good
lacing
it
has
a
slight
pub
bitter
taste
but
nothing
very
strong
well
balanced
it
goes
down
very
smooth
nice
and
light
i
had
to
give
it
some
extra
drinkability
points
due
to
my
love
of
monty
python
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
not
as
robust
as
i
want
in
a
good
craft
ale
thick
and
heavy
belying
its
low
abv
i
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
soon
d
more
than
drinkable
and
i
plan
to
purchase
it
again
this
would
be
nice
with
all
sorts
of
food
a
keeper
not
as
smooth
as
other
english
ales
out
there
solid
but
not
spectacular
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
amber
color
with
a
whispy
offwhite
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
pineapple
banana
with
a
toffeecaramel
background
the
flavor
comes
on
as
a
tart
banana
and
caramel
malt
blend
in
a
very
thin
textured
feel
pretty
easy
drinking
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
body
here
carbonation
is
equally
whimpy
not
sure
if
its
the
beer
imported
from
the
uk
or
the
tap
here
at
the
british
beer
company
in
hyannis
ma
very
sour
though
which
sort
of
spoils
any
of
the
banana
malt
subtleties
of
this
ale
i
would
tend
to
say
that
this
brew
has
gone
bad
but
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
good
taste
the
folks
at
the
bar
were
good
enough
to
sample
the
tap
themselves
but
assured
me
that
it
was
true
to
taste
and
i
opted
to
leave
about
onethird
of
the
pint
for
reclamation
the
sourness
just
didnt
taste
natural
to
me
and
ive
had
this
from
a
bottle
and
dont
recall
such
a
rough
ride
on
the
taste
buds
it
has
some
interesting
notes
but
if
this
is
really
supposed
to
taste
so
dishwater
sour
then
i
have
to
give
this
a
low
score
and
warn
all
comers
of
a
let
down
d
i
would
say
overall
this
is
less
of
a
craft
offering
than
i
had
expected
it
about
a
one
leg
up
on
something
such
as
bud
drinkability
looked
great
smelled
okay
tasted
less
okay
still
worth
getting
and
keeping
for
the
label
alone
serving
bottle
to
pint
i
recommend
this
for
anyone
to
try
at
least
once
drinkability
a
little
more
filling
and
substantial
than
i
expected
for
a
4
7
still
a
good
english
pale
you
could
have
a
few
of
even
if
it
is
just
the
novelty
talking
try
it
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
slightly
aboveaverage
epa
doesnt
live
up
to
the
marketing
of
it
being
a
python
fan
i
had
hoped
for
something
more
impressive
but
a
generally
decent
brew
d
a
little
more
filling
and
substantial
than
i
expected
for
a
4
7
still
a
good
english
pale
you
could
have
a
few
of
and
could
count
on
to
be
versatile
at
the
table
a
selection
at
the
new
local
pub
served
in
an
imperial
pint
20
oz
with
a
light
medium
bubble
head
and
an
orange
bronze
color
smells
of
raw
sugar
cane
and
a
bit
of
pineapple
taste
is
bitter
but
dry
with
a
brief
sweetness
followed
by
a
sharp
but
not
by
any
means
overbearing
bitterness
finish
very
light
and
refreshing
for
an
ale
actually
seems
to
lack
some
body
a
good
ale
for
a
lager
drinker
to
start
on
highly
drinkable
it
certainly
looks
good
but
fails
to
deliver
in
the
taste
dept
it
is
a
little
thin
on
flavour
but
it
is
a
pint
i
could
enjoy
drinking
all
night
500
ml
bottle
that
pours
a
shady
copper
orange
color
with
a
huge
rocky
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
nose
really
hasnt
mucha
little
fruity
with
some
buttery
caramel
overtones
taste
is
tangybitternessand
sweet
hitting
you
in
that
orderthe
fruitness
comes
out
at
you
right
after
and
than
the
bitter
kicks
in
again
with
some
malt
blending
in
medium
with
a
satisfieing
mouthfeel
to
this
one
quite
a
good
alei
must
saywell
worth
a
trycause
ill
surely
have
it
again
myself
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
boulevard
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
an
amber
orange
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
aroma
is
bready
up
front
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
hops
on
the
finish
the
taste
is
mainly
light
caramel
malts
with
a
lemony
finish
its
really
a
tasty
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
overly
so
its
a
highly
quaffable
brew
mfd
thin
to
moderate
feel
i
could
drink
a
few
pints
of
this
with
no
problem
not
as
good
as
black
sheep
but
its
a
good
epa
there
are
too
many
weird
noncomplementary
things
going
on
in
this
brew
which
may
work
for
its
label
namesakes
but
not
for
the
stuff
in
the
bottle
i
just
love
monty
pythons
holy
grail
so
naturally
i
had
to
watch
it
while
drinking
this
brew
between
gufaws
i
took
sips
and
was
surprised
by
its
smooth
flavorful
taste
poured
a
rich
tawny
color
with
a
head
that
can
choke
a
ladened
swallow
initially
aroma
was
of
caramel
malts
some
sugars
and
a
piney
hop
backdrop
taste
was
similar
and
nicely
balanced
with
roasted
caramel
malts
in
the
front
and
a
bittering
hop
finish
all
in
all
a
decent
brew
that
must
be
kept
away
from
the
killer
bunny
this
pours
an
organishbrown
with
a
nice
head
it
smells
very
sweet
with
grass
hops
and
a
touch
of
burnt
malt
it
starts
out
with
caramel
and
brown
sugar
then
the
hops
kick
in
and
turns
very
bitter
personally
this
was
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
beer
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
as
it
goes
down
overall
this
beer
did
not
warrant
the
price
i
paid
for
it
but
it
was
pretty
decent
overall
the
taste
is
light
too
very
drinkable
with
a
good
bitterness
decent
hop
maybe
even
bitter
orange
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
short
and
thin
tan
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
of
nice
roasted
malts
and
some
peppery
hoppy
aroma
as
well
it
tastes
of
nice
roasted
malts
then
some
citrisy
and
peppery
hops
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
fresh
and
crisp
feeling
which
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
the
taste
and
then
for
the
collectable
bottle
for
the
monty
python
fan
the
novelty
of
the
name
and
label
gave
me
low
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
drinker
overall
its
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
except
for
the
tempered
over
burning
witches
part
good
quality
but
not
the
best
value
a
hoppy
smell
mostly
light
and
airy
to
be
honest
but
some
faint
citric
notes
and
some
pearapple
smells
also
the
hops
come
out
at
the
start
as
this
beer
some
sharpness
to
it
tart
and
citric
apples
pears
lemons
this
beers
also
gave
off
a
light
coffee
maltbiscuit
impression
that
may
be
just
me
but
it
contained
a
malt
presence
on
the
backend
a
good
balanced
ale
but
to
be
honest
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
it
and
the
mp
thing
is
just
a
marketing
tool
to
get
people
to
try
this
beer
and
it
worked
have
a
few
heck
at
4
7
have
a
bunch
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
one
but
it
is
enjoyable
in
my
opinion
if
you
want
a
easy
to
find
english
pale
ale
stick
to
bass
d
ok
drinkability
a
gimmicky
name
cant
make
this
anymore
then
what
it
actually
is
an
ordinary
english
pale
ale
d
passable
i
suppose
but
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
the
end
this
is
an
easily
enjoyable
ale
ive
had
it
before
and
i
will
surely
have
some
again
ddrinks
well
not
heavy
could
drink
several
at
one
sitting
dont
drink
and
review
not
bad
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
english
pale
ale
it
should
also
be
noted
that
i
bought
this
beer
along
with
a
fullers
1875
that
had
a
freshness
date
of
2005
so
this
beer
may
be
old
too
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
chips
and
more
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
english
ales
not
english
humor
could
never
sit
through
an
entire
monty
python
movie
but
all
and
all
this
brew
is
pretty
average
silliness
d
not
too
drinkable
not
much
of
a
taste
to
it
and
the
mouthfeel
did
not
do
that
good
of
a
job
to
assist
the
taste
overall
definitely
could
have
been
better
the
smell
made
me
think
it
would
have
been
better
than
it
actually
was
slainte
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
not
the
most
complex
taste
but
it
definitely
keeps
you
interested
notes
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
like
the
sweetness
of
it
its
intersting
oddly
enough
its
not
bad
d
very
drinkable
would
be
great
just
for
an
occasion
when
in
the
mood
for
an
english
pale
ale
or
excellent
candidate
for
session
drinking
d
as
a
fan
of
english
beer
they
all
are
highly
drinkable
to
me
the
bottle
is
gimmicky
and
fun
and
that
adds
to
the
experience
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
beer
one
could
get
drunk
to
really
fast
lets
say
3
of
these
along
with
a
couple
of
low
point
beers
would
get
you
shotally
titfaced
i
cannot
say
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
i
dont
remember
too
much
of
the
night
when
i
started
it
out
with
this
one
d
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
session
beer
still
more
drinkable
than
even
corona
though
final
statement
the
green
apple
quality
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
could
not
finish
this
beer
d
overall
very
drinkable
had
a
nice
balanced
taste
in
my
opinion
for
an
english
ale
pours
clear
gold
with
a
medium
sized
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
malty
with
some
light
fruit
note
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
light
british
malt
flavor
sharp
hop
bitterness
finishes
cleanly
crisp
well
carbonated
fairly
drinkable
not
as
malty
as
most
english
ales
ive
had
fairly
average
brew
overall
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
color
with
little
head
no
lace
and
very
little
retention
smell
was
very
enjoyable
had
a
nice
fruit
aroma
and
my
first
impression
was
of
pears
taste
was
a
little
bland
nothing
terrible
but
nothing
standout
some
malt
good
amounts
of
fruit
apple
being
a
standout
and
it
leaves
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
light
carbonation
and
an
easily
drinkable
beer
this
isnt
as
memorable
as
monty
python
but
a
good
beer
not
a
bad
beer
per
say
but
nothing
very
impressive
ill
be
honest
i
only
bought
this
beer
becuase
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
python
and
thought
it
was
funny
i
was
plesantly
surprised
however
this
is
a
good
ale
nothing
award
winning
or
ground
breaking
but
a
solid
beer
i
would
recommened
i
good
full
bodied
well
rounded
ale
i
would
certianly
get
this
again
in
fact
i
know
i
will
overall
a
good
ale
its
like
monty
python
comedy
not
everyone
will
like
it
but
its
worth
a
shot
still
the
poo
element
is
not
overpowering
and
something
like
skunky
corona
is
much
worse
i
should
emphasize
that
it
doesnt
have
a
poo
taste
i
guess
but
does
have
a
waft
of
toilet
smell
will
i
buy
it
again
sure
but
not
for
my
own
consumption
d
pale
ales
in
general
arent
very
drinkable
for
me
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
brand
new
bottle
will
oftentimes
taste
overly
bitter
with
the
first
swig
but
then
the
flavors
begin
opening
up
and
blend
together
as
you
drink
the
bottle
its
a
great
beer
to
drink
during
the
winter
but
may
be
a
bit
too
heavy
to
drink
during
the
summertime
all
a
pretty
appetizing
brew
a
very
distinct
beer
a
little
bit
on
the
bitter
side
right
at
first
but
as
you
get
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
gets
a
little
sweeter
with
a
slight
hoppy
taste
to
it
pours
in
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
that
really
doesnt
last
but
still
has
a
slight
appeal
to
it
as
you
finish
the
beer
off
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
just
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
bottle
the
bottle
is
a
little
bit
larger
than
your
average
beer
making
it
difficult
to
pour
showed
a
rich
amber
colour
cloudy
with
a
large
and
lasting
rather
creamy
head
not
very
complicated
flavour
slight
hoppiness
in
the
beginning
and
it
finished
out
bitter
warm
and
full
bodied
pours
a
clean
pale
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
that
a
sweet
and
kind
of
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
tastes
of
a
standard
english
ale
dry
with
a
sweet
end
aftertastes
of
a
dry
alcohol
feeling
more
to
the
novelty
aspect
but
a
decent
english
ale
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
aroma
is
fairly
mild
but
pleasant
malts
dominate
but
also
present
are
some
fruity
esters
all
of
which
is
accompanied
by
hints
of
hops
and
earthiness
taste
seems
even
more
subdued
than
the
aroma
all
of
the
aromas
i
mentioned
were
present
in
the
taste
at
the
very
beginning
there
is
a
tinge
of
malty
sweetness
which
is
overtaken
by
a
pleasant
fruitiness
the
fruitiness
lingers
into
the
finish
where
it
is
joined
by
a
mild
hoppiness
with
a
small
bite
of
bitterness
at
the
very
end
of
the
finish
when
all
of
the
other
flavors
have
fallen
away
mediumlight
in
body
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
that
isnt
very
noticeable
drinkability
is
ok
this
really
isnt
anything
special
im
fairly
indifferent
about
this
beer
overall
d
i
guess
its
a
solid
english
brew
characteristically
bitter
no
offense
and
the
sour
apple
notes
give
it
a
little
spice
unless
i
just
happened
to
get
a
bad
bottle
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
terribly
memorable
besides
the
gimmicky
label
which
to
be
fair
is
most
of
the
reason
this
was
bought
anything
monty
python
gets
my
attention
getting
past
that
this
was
a
delightful
beginnning
to
the
end
of
a
warm
day
paid
3
99
i
suppose
was
worth
the
price
of
admission
wish
i
had
another
one
bummer
i
have
to
admit
it
like
many
others
i
bought
this
beer
just
because
of
the
name
looked
fine
a
light
amber
color
two
finger
thick
foamy
white
head
that
did
not
go
away
small
was
soft
grainy
malt
with
a
honeylike
sweetness
to
it
but
with
an
earth
tone
as
well
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
grain
and
wheat
malt
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
caramel
with
a
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
even
with
that
complexity
i
still
came
away
with
the
feeling
that
the
flavor
was
a
little
macro
a
little
thin
above
average
carbonation
and
a
runny
mouthfeel
somewhat
of
a
session
beer
worth
a
try
for
the
gimmick
but
if
you
want
a
pale
ale
i
would
sample
others
having
a
love
for
english
ales
i
would
say
that
this
one
was
rather
satisfing
and
enjoyable
smooth
and
malty
with
a
dry
hoppiness
i
have
seen
this
all
over
the
place
for
several
years
and
now
that
i
work
for
the
company
the
distributes
this
i
felt
i
should
give
it
a
go
it
poured
up
rather
average
looking
for
an
english
pale
ale
with
a
nice
looking
white
foamy
head
smell
was
earthy
hops
with
a
caramellike
malty
note
but
otherwise
rather
average
for
the
style
taste
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
which
i
enjoyed
somewhat
almost
thirst
quenching
mouthfeel
wasnt
out
of
the
ordinary
but
this
was
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
from
the
bottle
this
poured
a
orange
to
brown
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
left
lots
of
big
lacing
rings
nose
of
sweet
malts
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
again
sweet
malts
and
finish
is
slightly
bitter
nothing
fancy
here
bout
overall
a
decent
brew
d
an
okay
beer
nothing
to
seek
out
this
bottle
must
have
been
old
obviously
it
was
bought
for
the
namelabel
poured
a
light
hazy
strawapricot
color
off
aromasfishy
funky
also
some
vegetal
and
petrol
notes
taste
was
dry
thin
and
sour
light
and
spritzy
mouthfeel
drinkability
would
be
fine
at
this
abv
but
this
one
had
gone
bad
i
dont
imagine
they
intended
to
make
beer
that
smelledtasted
like
this
revisit
november
2009
im
adding
points
to
this
one
i
must
have
had
a
bad
bottle
because
the
nose
is
at
worst
inoffensive
but
has
some
plum
and
grape
skin
aromas
its
quite
nice
the
taste
is
also
quite
nice
it
is
certainly
a
light
beer
a
tad
watery
nothing
outstanding
but
certainly
a
respectable
beer
the
taste
started
surprisingly
bitter
and
hoppy
but
sweet
malt
balanced
it
out
the
hoppiness
became
less
pronounced
as
the
beer
went
down
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body

overall
a
decent
beer
but
black
sheep
ale
is
a
far
better
choice
from
this
brewery
its
a
fuzzy
yellow
beer
do
not
waste
your
time
or
money
the
only
reason
to
have
this
beer
would
be
to
display
the
bottle
if
youve
got
a
collection
of
beer
bottles
the
name
is
pretty
cool
an
ok
ale
ill
be
spending
my
on
others
copper
in
appearance
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
stays
awhile
smell
of
slight
malt
but
not
much
else
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
hoppy
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
probably
one
i
wouldnt
readily
try
again
it
has
the
hoppiness
but
its
not
one
that
finishes
clean
my
first
sip
shows
a
large
malt
profile
and
strong
toasted
notes
drowning
out
the
fruit
and
hops
i
was
expecting
to
at
least
detect
metal
also
sounds
in
early
and
often
which
is
unfortunate
almost
like
the
knights
soaked
their
swords
in
this
beer
for
a
week
before
it
was
bottled
not
cool
the
aftertaste
in
particular
is
rubbish
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
i
wont
be
dropping
four
bucks
on
this
stinker
again
a
nice
english
pale
ale
that
is
pretty
tasty
i
thought
it
might
be
a
bit
gimmicky
with
the
name
and
all
but
its
definitely
a
solid
beer
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
ill
probably
have
this
again
at
some
point
i
should
have
guessed
a
beer
named
monty
python
would
be
more
of
a
gimmick
than
a
master
crafted
brew
this
beer
really
didnt
appeal
to
me
at
all
i
probably
would
have
rather
had
a
decent
american
macro
i
tried
to
rate
it
as
fairly
as
possible
given
my
dislike
for
it
i
suggest
something
else
overall
i
would
say
this
is
just
a
good
beer
hence
the
reason
i
gave
it
all
4s
but
like
i
said
up
front
i
thought
the
movie
was
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
better
a
decent
stab
at
the
english
pale
ale
style
not
great
though
and
slightly
above
average
taste
mouthfeel
is
poor
and
there
is
little
carbonation
on
the
palate
this
beer
had
a
thick
frothy
head
though
and
it
made
me
look
forward
to
drinking
it
but
the
beer
itself
was
just
decent
not
much
to
it
no
frills
but
not
bad
i
want
a
little
more
flavor
for
a
session
beer
this
is
a
beer
to
chug
in
my
opinion
it
is
very
very
light
the
bottle
is
worth
collecting
all
in
all
its
tasty
and
ill
probably
buy
it
again
particularly
when
i
want
something
refreshing
but
i
dont
see
it
making
its
way
into
common
rotation
in
my
beer
consumption
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
light
amber
color
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
thick
head
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
pleasant
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
has
a
sweet
fruitiness
about
it
but
is
well
balanced
by
a
moderate
hop
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
outstanding
either
drinkability
nice
flavorful
ale
that
goes
down
easy
drinkability
not
great
but
worth
trying
theres
nothing
objectionable
about
it
its
just
not
superb
an
average
english
pale
ale
drinkable
yes
anytime
in
my
new
very
fragle
but
very
cool
glass
a
nice
touch
indeed
poured
a
clear
nice
amber
with
a
huge
white
head
very
slow
fade
to
leave
a
nice
half
inch
lace
filled
head
lots
of
carbonation
no
real
gooey
glass
clinging
lace
on
this
left
a
clean
glass
not
a
whole
lot
of
smell
here
what
is
there
is
a
bready
yeasty
smell
from
the
malts
but
again
not
real
strong
pretty
typical
for
the
style
taste
fared
the
same
not
strong
not
bad
at
all
pretty
average
some
bready
and
grain
tastes
but
that
was
about
it
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
in
a
crowd
it
did
have
a
nice
smooth
feel
crisp
light
dare
i
say
refreshing
and
excellent
session
beer
all
and
all
this
was
a
typical
sessionable
english
brown
ale
more
notable
for
the
name
then
whats
in
the
bottle
a
good
one
off
try
for
the
novelity
if
nothing
else
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
it
was
worth
a
shot
for
the
novelty
and
it
was
a
fairly
pleasant
brew
to
boot
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
a
pretty
average
ale
without
any
outstanding
characteristics
meh
to
me
this
tastes
more
like
a
bitter
but
im
no
expert
on
english
style
brews
drinkability
nope
not
another
one
for
me
nice
to
say
i
tried
it
but
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
at
least
to
my
taste
tmd
almost
light
on
the
the
pallet
overall
bitter
body
with
a
very
light
herbal
characteristic
while
the
body
is
bitter
the
beer
finishes
pretty
clean
with
a
very
slight
fruity
sweetness
not
bad
but
not
great
there
are
definitively
other
english
pale
ales
i
would
grab
first
taste
is
a
standard
british
pale
ale
while
decently
carbonated
in
terms
of
head
it
is
slightly
flat
in
mouthfeel
taste
elements
are
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
but
clearly
a
bit
more
emphasis
on
the
hoppy
aspect
woody
and
somewhat
chalky
as
well
low
abv
makes
it
a
decent
session
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
versatile
for
pairing
with
food
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
this
pale
ale
it
pours
a
basic
amber
with
a
decent
head
with
some
retention
and
lacing
its
smells
quite
yeasty
and
a
bit
skunking
the
taste
is
strong
and
too
bitter
there
is
a
notable
sulfur
and
skunky
quality
to
it
and
it
leaves
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
its
mouthfeel
is
fair
but
i
dont
see
really
drinking
this
one
to
me
this
is
a
text
book
english
pale
ale
a
tad
overpriced
but
very
true
to
the
style
and
enjoyable
like
so
many
others
i
picked
this
one
up
mostly
for
the
name
pours
a
deep
golden
color
carbonation
freely
flowing
upwards
full
head
that
quickly
deflates
without
dissipating
smell
is
fruity
with
some
hops
taste
is
hard
to
pin
down
hints
of
fruits
orange
apple
maybe
hops
slight
bitterness
and
a
dull
metallic
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
light
almost
feels
more
like
lightly
carbonated
seltzer
water
than
beer
drinkability
is
excellent
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
perfectly
capable
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
again
medium
bodied
and
astringintley
sticky
i
think
this
batch
has
an
unfortunate
amount
of
tannins
or
something
not
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
its
a
decent
english
session
pale
ale
nothing
particularly
special
about
it
imo
if
you
are
a
monty
python
fan
go
out
and
get
some
it
is
tempered
over
burning
witches
after
all
i
think
that
if
it
had
more
of
a
nvtty
character
it
would
be
more
fitting
as
a
beer
itself
its
not
bad
either
pours
a
very
clear
mediumdark
copper
with
a
fairly
large
offwhite
head
that
lasts
well
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
smell
is
of
fruity
hops
lots
of
esters
going
on
here
apple
and
berry
along
with
some
caramel
and
malt
sugars
and
a
touch
of
buttery
diacetyl
taste
is
less
hoppy
with
the
toffees
taking
the
lead
malts
and
grains
show
prominently
modest
butter
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
lacks
the
crispness
that
i
hope
for
in
a
pale
ale
and
drinkability
is
good
not
bad
at
all
the
guys
at
black
sheep
come
through
again
like
othersi
bought
this
beer
because
of
its
name
and
i
must
say
that
although
its
not
that
bad
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
againbut
if
its
offered
to
me
i
wont
think
twice
about
taking
it
it
has
a
semilight
amber
color
to
itand
has
a
slight
alcohol
scent
it
produces
a
nice
head
that
quickly
disappears
and
has
very
little
lace
its
moouthfeel
leaves
somthing
to
be
desired
but
isnt
bad
and
it
has
a
mild
bitter
after
taste
had
this
on
tap
at
the
berkley
front
earlier
this
summer
poured
a
nice
amber
with
a
nice
sizes
light
tan
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
aroma
got
some
caramelized
malts
with
some
hops
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
that
is
all
folks
flavor
not
much
going
on
here
did
get
some
malt
and
hops
has
a
bitter
finish
which
would
be
the
only
thing
going
for
it
pours
a
hazy
amberish
copper
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
slight
herbal
hoppiness
with
some
diacetyl
and
strangely
a
bit
of
apple
the
taste
features
a
good
dose
of
herbal
hops
some
diacetyl
a
bit
of
mustiness
and
is
a
slight
bit
metallic
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
certainly
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
drop
the
few
dollars
on
this
again
in
the
nature
of
its
style
this
beer
is
by
definition
mild
a
pretty
fun
label
and
name
but
unfortuantly
quite
clement
amiable
certainly
pleasant
yes
soothing
to
an
extent
maybe
i
have
only
good
things
to
say
but
none
of
them
really
amount
to
anything
more
than
temperate
my
opinion
too
was
mild
easy
to
find
beer
here
nice
gimmick
average
beer
pours
orange
brownish
color
like
a
regular
ale
should
barely
smell
anything
in
the
beer
what
i
can
is
sweet
malt
tastes
like
candied
citrus
fruits
like
orange
or
tangerine
but
its
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
a
little
bit
of
bitter
aftertaste
overall
its
not
bad
nothing
to
get
overexcited
about
but
nice
to
try
at
least
once
a
great
show
and
a
great
name
for
a
not
so
great
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
reddish
orange
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingers
and
excellent
lacing
from
there
i
must
say
nee
aroma
is
faint
grassy
floral
hops
taste
is
ok
but
no
flavor
in
particular
jumps
out
palate
is
immediately
too
dry
not
bitter
enough
and
slightly
metallic
nice
try
but
not
there
notes
i
liked
this
one
one
of
the
best
from
a
style
i
generally
avoid
this
one
hits
the
mark
though
and
could
easily
be
a
favorite
session
beer
if
priced
right
overall
initial
taste
was
very
good
again
i
didnt
like
that
dried
out
my
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
again
light
with
again
a
good
bitterness
maybe
some
light
sugary
here
again
decent
beer
but
not
as
good
as
the
movie
run
away
this
is
a
tastey
beer
but
its
one
that
i
want
only
once
in
a
while
its
not
that
its
bad
i
think
one
or
two
satisfies
me
for
a
while
and
i
can
move
on
to
something
else
finally
i
am
seriously
wanting
a
monty
python
tap
handle
it
is
a
thing
of
beauty
d
in
some
ways
this
is
an
unremarkable
epa
it
expresses
the
style
well
good
session
beer
imo
and
well
executed
a
fine
example
of
a
good
english
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
easy
to
drink
very
predictable
as
an
english
ale
monty
pythons
holy
grail
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
16
9
ounce
bottle
a
bit
of
caramel
or
toffee
is
noticeable
in
the
smell
the
flavor
starts
out
with
the
carameltoffee
flavor
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
diacetyl
then
fades
into
a
lightly
metallic
hop
flavor
not
a
bad
ale
but
not
outstanding
worth
a
try
notes
i
found
this
one
appears
to
be
all
about
the
marketing
and
label
and
could
use
more
substance
behind
it
taste
is
zippy
with
a
zesty
lemon
sourness
unfortunately
the
malts
dont
shine
through
in
the
taste
a
faint
roasted
flavour
the
only
evidence
of
them
the
hop
flavour
is
exceptional
though
light
yet
full
of
life
not
a
very
good
malthop
balance
in
my
opinion
but
not
unpleasant
either
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
this
beer
dances
on
the
tongue
unlike
so
many
english
ales
ive
had
dry
and
sticks
to
the
throat
a
little
this
walks
the
line
between
light
and
heavy
so
well
and
the
hoppiness
is
quite
welcome
and
refreshing
on
my
palate
a
very
enjoyable
epa
recommended
seek
out
this
one
ontap
not
a
bad
beer
complex
but
the
hops
are
a
little
dominating
which
some
people
may
prefer
buy
it
for
the
bottle
i
did
its
not
a

beer
at
all
just
less
interesting

i
expected
or
hoped
for

and
a

average

here
light
hops
bready
sweet
background
mouthfeel
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
not
a
very
good
brew
imo
but
something
i
will
drink
if
its
the
only
beer
around
a
solid
example
of
the
english
pale
ale
style
give
one
of
these
a
try

damn
good
it
would
be
better
if
it
was
a
normal
price
cheers
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
seems
oddly
more
bland
from
the
tap
then
out
of
the
bottle
its
none
too
exciting
either
way
as
stated
in
my
other
review
i
can
see
this
as
a
great
training
wheels
beer
for
the
uninitiated
not
too
hoppy
not
overly
tasty
but
enough
there
to
know
its
a
good
beer
ill
try
it
again
sometime
but
it
wont
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
any
time
soon
lightmedium
body
with
a
brisk
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
with
the
mild

and

this
ones
a
very

cheers
md
not
quite
complex
this
beer
retains
a
very
healthy
balance
and
a
medium
body
while
the
softlycarbonated
mouthfeel
ensures
an
aboveaverage
quaffability
its
hard
to
dislike
this
beer
just
like
most
british
bitters
on
form
yet
its
also
hard
to
rate
it
higher
than
black
sheeps
other
brews
as
its
slightly
pale
in
terms
of
overall
complexity
apart
from
the
floral
motif
i
personally
would
place
it
under
the
bitter
category
but
since
bitter
also
derives
from
pale
ale
im
fine
with
its
identity
as
it
is
i
will
definitely
have
one
again
now
go
away
or
i
will
taunt
you
a
second
time
pours
vibrantly
with
a
towering
dimpled
head
of
eggshell
colored
bubbles
of
all
sizes
slowly
settles
with
lost
of
divots
forming
leaving
sheets
of
sticky
lacing
clinging
to
the
sides
a
hazy
golden
caramel
color
with
minimal
carbonation
streams
the
smell
is
restrained
slightly
fruity
dark
fruits
rather
than
citrus
the
taste
is
slightly
flat
bittered
fruit
only
modest
malt
sweetness
initially
followed
by
quiet
hop
bitterness
no
hop
bite
more
of
a
nibble
there
are
some
barely
perceptible
caramel
notes
but
the
taste
is
generally
flaccid
there
is
perhaps
a
slightly
off
bitterness
that
maybe
shouldnt
be
present
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
minimal
carbonation
lacking
character
and
commitment
to
the
cause
something
seems
just
a
bit
askew
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
batch
of
burning
witches
used
for
tempering
drinkability
id
pass
on
this
one
definitely
drinkable
and
i
love
to
support
any
beer
thats
been
tempered
over
burning
witches

malts
and
enough
hops
to
achieve
a
worthwhile
balance
from
notes
its
plenty
crisp
in
a
sturdy
medium
body
with
a
smooth
flow
easing
off
into
the
finish
but
not
thinning
theres
a
light
earth
and
herbal
dryness
in
the
middle
and
beyond
ultimately
making
for
a
semidry
feel
it
has
an
accentuated
bitterness
and
a
very
light
body
mellow
and
soft
body
very
easy
to
drink
gotta
love
it
when
awesome
customers
travel
to
the
uk
and
bring
you
back
some
tasty
beverages
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlytoasted
biscuit
mild
grass
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
vein
of
sweetness
stemming
from
the
biscuit
though
this
serves
only
to
perfectly
balance
the
grassy
and
flowery
hops
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
this
stuff
is
not
gonna
set
the
world
on
fire
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
very
tasty
very
easytodrink
little
brew
something
tells
me
it
would
taste
just
grand
wow
did
i
just
say

o

this
will

packaged
in

500
ml
brown
glass
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
odd
beer
with
a
nice
appearance
the
beer
is
transparent
and
amber
hued
with
a
soft
white
head
biscuit
and
bread
aroma
a
simple
beer
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
notes
of
toasted
grains
and
a
subtle
earthy
quality
perhaps
mushrooms
light
bodied
and
while
unexciting
certainly
drinkable
worth
a
try
o
fantastic
english
pale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
recently
overall
this
would
have
scored
even
higher
if
it
was
full
bodied
but
thats
just
my
personal
opinion
i
appreciate
that
others
might
prefer
this
type
of
mouthfeel
either
way
its
a
great
beer
and
one
i
would
certainly
recommend
ill
probably
try
one
again
in
the
near
future
and
see
if
i
like
the
feel
better
overall
a
solid
bitter
notes
this
is
what
a
good
beer
is
hits
all
4
aspects
well
great
for
style
its
good
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
im
learning
to
appreciate
low
booze
mellow
balanced
english
brews
o
good
beer
for
the
style
which
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
personally
i
would
not
go
back
for
another
in
a
single
sitting
on
the
other
hand
i
would
not
refuse
this
beer
if
i
came
across
it
again
overall
this
is
a
nice
ale
and
id
definitely
recommend
it
id
even
think
about
getting
a
few
of
these
to
enjoy
over
an
evening
sometime
in
the
future
poured
a
amber
body
with
and
off
white
head
smell
is
sour
and
not
pleasing
at
all
taste
is
sugary
sweet
and
also
not
pleasing
medium
mouthfeel
overall
i
didnt
like
this
beer
at
all
i
would
avoid
this
next
time
too
many
off
smells
and
tastes
for
my
liking
in
a
blind
taste
test
even
i
could
pick
out
the
country
england
far
more
than
some
other
pale
ales
black
sheep
has
the
aroma
and
flavor
profile
of
a
bitter
or
an
esb
that
esthery
smell
with
yeast
and
caramel
malt
is
one
of
a
kind
complex
flavor
youd
think
this
is
a
dark
almost
black
beer
from
the
name
but
no
just
the
classic
copper
look
with
a
fine
head
classic
being
the
key
term
the
dark
brown
bottle
simply
preserves
the
freshness
better
a
solid
recommendation
here
serving
type
bottle
a
decent
ale
a
restrained
flavour
and
good
body
make
for
easy
drinking
dry
but
fruity
wellcrafted
and
worth
sampling
overall
a
decent
english
pale
ale
with
the
low
abv
4
4
a
nice
session
brew
overall
decent
and
widely
distributed
but
when
there
are
decent
pale
ales
from
other
breweries
available
i
would
certainly
skip
this
one
nice
not
a
must
have
this
is
really
good
i
may
need
to
stock
it
in
the
cellar
if
i
can
find
it
again
overall
not
bad
at
all
easy
drinker
has
nice
amount
of
hop
and
malt
flavor
slighty
too
bitter
and
overpowers
the
overall
sweetness
but
other
then
that
a
decent
english
pale
ale
a
solid
english
pale
ale
in
fact
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
ive
ignored
this
beer
for
years
and
im
not
sure
why
so
im
glad
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
bottle
on
a
whim
pours
a
nice
amber
not
copper
colored
but
not
as
pale
as
some
pale
ales
from
england
either
a
medium
head
that
eventually
fades
away
away
to
nothing
very
little
of
the
often
present
metallic
aroma
in
present
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
buttery
note
that
is
not
out
of
place
in
the
style
as
well
as
some
earthiness
some
clean
graininess
and
a
decent
bitterness
particularly
on
the
finish
a
light
biscuity
sweetness
on
the
palate
as
well
but
that
plays
well
with
the
hops
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
more
i
like
it
always
a
good
sign
overall
nice
drink
for
pubquiz
i
enjoy
this
beer
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
with
a
good
english
style
balance
seems
like
it
would
be
a
very
good
cask
beer
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
overall
not
bad
nothing
outstanding
about
this
pours
golden
with
two
finger
white
head
smells
like
a
general
ale
with
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
malt
sweetness
from
malts
and
a
bit
of
bitter
from
hops
this
is
nothing
special
it
is
just
a
standard
ale
i
feel
that
this
is
about
as
middle
of
the
road
as
you
can
get
o
nothing
overwhelming
on
the
palette
but
certainly
poundable
nice
light
crisp
english
ale
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
black
sheep
is
one
ale
that
i
put
off
trying
for
years
but
i
thought
that
i
would
like
it
the
reality
is
that
this
okay
but
it
looks
like
ill
be
putting
off
a
second
helping
for
longer
than
i
put
off
my
first
helping
verdict
you
can
find
better
british
ales
for
around
the
same
price
point
look
elsewhere
as
this
is
undistinctive
the
black
sheep
ale
is
much
like
most
of
the
esbs
on
the
market
out
there
the
color
is
amber
or
copper
the
head
is
white
and
soapy
the
lacing
isnt
too
bad
here
the
smell
is
mostly
malts
and
a
little
bitterness
going
on
the
flavors
are
of
dry
malts
with
a
little
sweetness
in
the
background
the
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
for
the
most
part
really
drinkable
notes
overall
it
goes
down
easy
but
the
thin
feel
and
flavor
are
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
do
like
what
is
there
but
i
just
want
a
little
more
of
it
md
more
carbonated
than
i
would
have
wanted
i
would
expect
this
to
be
much
better
on
cask
d
nothing
special
about
this
pint
average
at
best
overall
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
the
nice
sweet
aroma
that
the
beer
had
the
balance
of
that
sweet
aroma
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
hoppy
bitter
finish
made
for
a
nice
complex
flavor
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
beer
drinker
out
there
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
prefer
the
yorksire
ale
more
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
it
if
you
enjoy
english
ales
final
thoughts
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
bittersweet
chocolate
or
nutty
beers
good
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
dark
ales
ive
had
recently
this
is
an
excellent
all
round
ale
that
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
would
work
wonders
as
a
session
ale
pours
a
clear
coppery
amber
color
with
a
nice
plume
of
sticky
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
nutty
with
touches
of
toffee
fruit
bread
and
earthyherbaly
hops
taste
brings
all
the
components
of
scent
in
a
nic
elight
balanced
flavor
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
dry
a
nicely
english
pale
ale
with
good
flavor
for
the
low
abvs
big
english
hops
the
bitter
side
of
bitter
nice
feel
too
id
go
back
nice
stuff
drink
ability
is
hard
to
explain
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
to
try
to
figure
this
beer
out
its
not
horrible
tasting
but
just
overall
a
very
strange
beer
d
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
and
would
definitely
work
as
a
session
beer
drink
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
session
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
drinkability
goes
quite
well
with
a
meal
apple
cider
chicken
and
mashed
potatoes
enough
flavor
to
be
noticed
but
not
so
much
that
it
gets
in
the
way
i
think
this
one
would
be
right
on
from
a
cask
and
its
a
very
good
and
sessionable
british
ale
it
may
not
be
tops
in
everything
but
it
was
gone
fast
overall
quite
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
i
had
more
than
one
thisd
be
a
great
session
beer
dr
wont
buy
it
again
especially
at
this
price
drinkability
a
fantastic
session
beer
that
ranks
with
the
finest
of
what
gets
imported
from
the
british
isles
pours
a
pale
copper
colour
with
a
light
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
sweet
malt
and
candy
apple
come
off
of
the
nose
leaving
a
little
to
be
desired
a
nice
bitterness
comes
out
from
the
first
sip
with
an
underlying
sweetness
the
malt
reveals
itself
before
the
hops
takeover
for
a
long
dry
finish
medium
body
and
well
structured
i
will
probably
pick
this
up
every
so
often
a
quality
british
ale
black
sheep
ale
has
a
lagerlike
ordinariness
and
an
overall
shruginducing
whatwasthepointness
d
superbly
drinkable
beer
and
something
that
may
very
well
enter
my
normal
rotation
or
at
the
very
least
something
i
will
frequently
suggest
to
others
drinkability
an
enjoyable
beer
nothing
i
would
hunt
down
but
would
drink
if
offered
overall
i
found
the
beer
lacked
a
punch
taste
in
the
end
there
was
no
quality
that
separates
it
from
the
rest
in
its
field
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
nice
white
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
smell
is
of
bready
malt
with
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
flavour
has
very
little
bitterness
for
a
pale
ale
but
nothing
is
off
about
it
either
carbonation
level
is
good
overall
a
little
bit
weak
pasteurizing
a
beer
and
then
bottling
it
and
shipping
it
half
way
across
the
planet
only
to
have
it
sit
on
a
shelf
for
an
uncertain
amount
of
time
at
warm
temperatures
is
kind
of
like
driving
a
stake
through
its
heart
and
hoping
that
it
dies
and
fails
that
being
said
black
sheep
ale
still
fares
surprisingly
well
and
makes
a
great
quaff
for
anyone
who
appreciates
flavourful
sessionable
and
traditional
britishstyle
ales
d
easily
sessionable
due
to
the
light
flavors
and
low
alcohol
this
is
a
very
dry
and
nicely
bitter
beer
that
is
pleasing
to
drink
again
would
have
liked
more
forward
flavors
overall
rather
average
in
many
ways
for
an
epa
hazy
brownorangey
color
loose
white
head
fizzy
carbonation
with
a
notthin
but
notdense
body
the
odd
thing
is
that
the
aroma
was
packed
with
the
stuff
i
really
enjoy
about
uk
ales
sharp
fruit
pushed
forward
by
a
bitterness
that
isnt
sour
and
isnt
harsh
but
the
taste
was
rather
flat
it
was
okay
but
after
the
first
whiff
i
felt
the
rug
being
yanked
so
cruelly
from
under
my
feet
weep
for
me
tried
this
new
one
on
a
whim
win
some
lose
some
not
a
terrible
beer
but
probably
not
worth
another
buy
for
me
historically
this
style
hasnt
been
my
favorite
but
i
think
there
is
more
potential
than
was
delivered
here
the
beer
poured
a
nice
thick
head
nothing
really
notable
in
the
aroma
but
not
bad
either
the
taste
seemed
to
be
some
standard
malts
and
hops
maybe
a
touch
of
ginger
not
a
ton
going
on
fairly
light
finished
dry
you
could
drink
more
than
one
if
its
around
it
isnt
a
bad
option
but
there
is
likely
more
excitement
in
the
competition
around
it
pours
a
very
nice
copper
hue
with
a
frothig
offwhite
light
khaki
head
forming
large
bubbles
and
dwindles
at
a
moderate
pace
aroma
has
a
great
ripe
plum
and
fig
fruity
tone
that
jumps
out
with
the
initial
smell
some
earthy
herbal
qualities
are
tucked
beneath
a
sweet
bread
malt
profile
flavor
is
balanced
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
in
either
direction
very
much
an
english
session
ale
finishes
pretty
dry
some
definite
hop
character
with
some
mineral
water
tones
a
bit
of
caramelized
fruit
and
earthy
herbal
hop
flavor
blend
nicely
mouthfeel
is
well
rounded
medium
bodied
dry
semi
bitter
finish
left
behind
on
the
palate
between
each
sip
drinkability
overall
is
prett
solid
i
would
just
rather
drink
a
10
dollar
six
pack
instead
of
this
for
3
99
a
bottle
worth
a
shot
especially
if
your
into
english
ales
i
will
see
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
i
might
be
too
nice
this
was
really
unbalanced
and
i
wont
go
for
another
one
d
an
easydrinking
epa
not
a
standout
by
any
means
but
quite
decent
d
nice
change
from
overly
sweet
ales
flavors
are
light
and
mild
overall
it
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
i
wanted
another
a
reserved
enjoyable
enough
and
still
quite
tasty
crisp
british
pale
ale
more
or
less
well
balanced
and
a
candidate
as
a
decent
potential
sessioner
were
i
ever
in
a
joint
that
offered
such
an
option
in
the
glass
good
foamy
head
warm
reddish
amber
color
buttery
funk
with
yeasty
grains
in
the
nosevery
doughlike
taste
malty
cracker
dry
with
smooth
butter
to
balancevery
breadlike
a
bit
syrupy
in
the
mouthfeel
an
enjoyable
lingering
aftertaste
d
drinking
this
was
a
breeze
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
given
the
unique
contrasting
flavors
d
a
good
beer
to
sit
and
contemplate
for
a
half
hour
or
more
would
buy
again
notes
this
was
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
how
i
felt
exactly
about
this
however
this
is
toward
the
top
for
easy
to
drink
subtle
flavor
that
builds
while
you
drink
it
drinkability
great
beer
and
i
would
rate
this
very
high
in
its
category
really
enjoyable
d
this
is
my
favorite
category
of
beer
and
wish
this
is
how
our
standard
beers
were
made
i
would
love
this
one
to
be
available
on
tap
where
i
am
its
lower
alcohol
level
makes
this
one
easy
to
enjoy
as
a
session
beer
and
would
go
well
with
salty
fried
pub
food
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
just
short
of
fullers
london
pride
but
a
strong
second
a
decent
english
pale
but
at
the
price
point
its
not
one
ill
regularly
pick
up
bitter
and
full
but
not
memorable
serving
12oz
bottle
drinkability
to
me
this
one
met
the
style
guidelines
the
tea
taste
is
the
dominate
flavor
i
was
not
overly
fond
of
it
and
have
had
better
in
the
style
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
d
tastes
are
rather
muted
on
this
one
goes
down
easily
somewhat
tasty
abv
makes
it
highly
drinkable
though
i
may
opt
for
others
of
the
style
the
taste
has
definite
but
moderate
bitterness
up
front
balanced
with
sweetness
the
two
balance
each
other
nicely
throughout
although
the
bitterness
has
just
the
edge
by
the
finish
making
it
slightly
on
the
bitterside
but
with
a
firm
sweet
malty
base
flavours
are
firm
toasted
grain
faintly
caramelly
qwith
light
leafycitrusy
hops
the
feel
is
lively
and
zesty
with
a
long
smooth
but
very
crisp
clean
finish
followed
by
an
aftertaste
of
light
cistrusyresiny
bitterness
and
mild
grain
sweetness
like
the
monty
python
holy
ale
this
is
really
not
that
good
kind
of
a
cool
label
but
that
is
it
nothing
bad
but
nothing
good
either
two
many
of
these
and
i
may
not
be
able
to
stop
myself
there
is
a
simple
timelessness
found
in
good
english
ales
right
in
this
one
the
beer
shows
a
copperorange
body
with
three
fingers
of
tight
beige
head
the
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
behind
a
spotty
lace
i
smell
deep
notes
of
caramel
and
damp
earth
in
this
ales
inviting
aroma
theres
a
light
hit
of
cracker
at
the
beginning
followed
by
caramel
and
treacle
this
is
followed
by
a
musty
leafy
bitterness
midpalate
that
carries
into
a
long
finish
faint
fruit
notes
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
bit
medium
bodied
with
almost
flat
carbonation
its
very
smooth
it
feels
substantial
in
the
mouth
without
being
bloating
or
filling
its
a
great
session
ale
d
pretty
good
id
call
this
a
moreorless
standard
english
pale
ale
drinkability
is
very
high
d
good
yorkshire
ale
maybe
not
competition
for
samuel
smiths
beers
but
still
a
flavoursome
ale
in
its
own
right
drinkabilty
easy
drinkability
overall
a
good
beer
fans
of
boddingtons
would
probably
like
this
goes
down
nice
very
good
drinkablility
very
good
session
ale
its
slightly
complex
because
of
the
different
levels
like
bitter
buttery
malty
id
buy
it
again
and
stop
my
wife
from
laying
the
bottle
on
its
side
in
the
fridge
which
is
what
must
have
caused
the
foaming
id
say
its
crisp
and
bittersweet
but
not
overly
dry
not
at
all
and
id
say
there
are
lots
of
beers
i
like
better
but
there
is
no
mistaking
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
was
a
much
more
complex
beer
than
i
thought
its
amazing
what
some
brewers
can
do
with
their
brews
even
at
a
sessionable
abv
d
the
light
mouthfeel
combine
with
the
satisfying
taste
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
english
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
overall
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
drinkability
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
refreshing
simple
nothing
offensive
i
can
definitely
sit
and
relax
with
a
couple
of
these
good
density
to
the
just
offwhite
foam
pleasingly
slow
dissolve
with
a
highly
respectable
lacing
left
behind
as
much
golden
orange
as
brown
in
hue
more
jaundice
yellow
around
the
rims
clear
with
visible
bubbles
very
dry
and
bready
nose
sourdough
raw
pretzel
dough
rye
quite
floral
at
times
no
real
fruit
presence
hint
of
powdered
chocolate
otherwise
its
a
clean
and
openly
knit
presentation
more
tactful
than
penetrating
mediumbodied
dry
and
even
with
above
average
carbonation
seems
reluctant
to
move
forward
same
crisp
sour
profile
of
sourdough
rye
pumpernickel
bread
gets
drier
and
drier
with
each
sip
the
floral
side
diminished
here
in
turn
the
mocha
cocoa
so
dry
it
hardly
registers
vague
raw
yeastiness
not
much
going
on
here
even
if
true
to
the
style
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
buttery
diacetyl
crystal
malts
toffee
caramel
maybe
some
roasted
notes
too
the
nose
is
quite
good
the
taste
is
really
nice
old
fashioned
toffee
the
kind
your
grandmother
would
have
in
the
candy
dish
caramel
maybe
a
chocolate
hint
or
two
there
is
ample
carbonation
a
slightly
prickly
mouthfeel
some
very
tasty
bittersweet
malts
the
beer
is
a
bit
nutty
and
drying
in
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
slight
this
beer
is
quite
a
session
beer
at
4
4
abv
but
with
a
full
palate
of
flavors
a
substantial
enough
body
and
lots
of
character
this
is
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
more
interesting
given
its
relative
rarity
but
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
its
just
a
dry
english
pale
ale
good
not
great
i
hardly
ever
slam
a
beer
and
this
is
about
as
close
as
i
come
but
this
is
horrible
i
cant
say
i
would
ever
want
to
purposefully
try
this
beer
again
its
dry
and
rather
stale
much
like
eating
week
old
french
bread
stay
away
a
lot
of
floral
hops
come
gushing
through
the
palate
blended
with
a
rich
sticky
maltiness
very
bitter
finish
to
an
otherwise
short
sweet
palate
almost
an
ipa
bitterness
really
although
its
more
of
a
lingering
than
an
upfront
hit
very
bittersweet
flavour
a
bit
lacking
in
complexity
but
otherwise
quite
nice
the
hops
and
malt
are
actually
very
nicely
balanced
to
make
this
a
competent
and
drinkable
english
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
but
thats
the
only
real
issue
immaculately
thin
and
crisp
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
soft
smoothness
from
malt
it
has
the
thin
body
a
nitrostout
has
after
all
the
funs
gone
only
it
has
carbonation
to
boot
soft
malt
chocolate
toffee
and
biscuit
notions
moderate
dull
bitterness
like
tea
or
coffee
bean
as
far
as
flavor
goes
its
quite
reserved
tastes
okay
feels
good
excellent
drinkability
pouring
into
a
mug
resulted
in
a
medium
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
sticky
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
scent
is
very
faint
leaving
me
unable
to
really
identify
any
particular
scents
taste
is
fairly
smooth
somewhat
malty
with
a
bittersweetness
to
it
feels
refreshing
but
leaves
the
mouth
somewhat
dry
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
for
the
patio
season
really
solid
atmosphere
nice
appearance
and
although
nose
is
only
mildly
complex
it
is
very
pleasing
malt
has
a
roasted
yet
smooth
quality
nice
complimentary
tones
more
like
a
bitter
than
a
pale
ale
really
flavorwise
and
heavier
bodywise
than
you
generally
associate
with
the
style
overall
really
good
quaff
waiting
to
have
it
on
tap
or
cask
black
sheep
is
above
average
beer
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
way
more
hops
and
a
stronger
nose
would
improve
it
a
good
bit
i
dont
hate
it
but
im
not
exactly
loving
it
either
its
very
hohum
if
you
will
but
thats
generally
my
opinion
for
the
style
worth
a
try
nonetheless
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
slight
carbonated
and
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
the
finish
of
the
beer
is
bitter
but
not
overpowering
the
beer
is
subtle
and
very
tasty
the
pale
ale
is
well
made
and
quite
refreshing
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
very
drinkable
easy
to
finish
and
easy
to
think
about
going
for
2nd
solid
brew
pours
with
four
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaves
a
good
lace
clear
deep
amber
color
light
earthy
nose
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
nearly
balanced
but
hops
win
some
initial
sweetness
hop
bite
at
finish
that
lingers
500ml
bottle
from
barbs
beer
emporium
concord
nh
drinkability
is
average
its
good
but
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
unless
theres
not
much
else
available
i
think
there
was
a
possibility
this
one
was
in
the
sun
future
outlook
old
bottle
hard
to
say
without
any
notation
on
the
bottle
from
which
to
deduce
freshness
i
cant
really
see
any
reason
to
give
this
one
another
shot
flavourful
with
a
great
feel
to
it
should
have
picked
up
more
bottles
of
this
tasty
stuff
allaround
great
english
pale
ale
d
low
abv
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
that
will
wow
you
just
a
sit
back
relax
drink
a
really
nice
session
brew
with
gentle
flavors
that
really
work
together
overall
a
nice
balanced
smooth
pale
ale
not
much
on
the
nose
but
other
then
that
i
was
impressed
would
reccomend
it
d
a
beer
i
could
have
several
of
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
perhaps
this
was
an
older
bottle
where
the
hops
had
faded
but
this
was
very
average
certainly
was
not
above
average
in
any
way
d
i
wasnt
super
impressed
by
this
one
low
abv
makes
this
a
nice
session
beer
however
i
hope
this
was
an
old
beer
or
the
taste
was
just
too
bitter
to
balance
well

overall

9
oz
bottle
purchased
a
bottle
from
biggs
beer
in
vancouver
wa
this
pale
ale
poured
into
my
pils
glass
looking
just
like
an
ipa
last
night
they
are
cousins
after
all
it
poured
hazy
orange
with
almost
one
finger
of
off
white
head
that
stuck
around
just
for
a
bit
nose
is
malty
sweet
and
has
a
bit
of
sour
note
in
there
like
the
vinegar
you
use
for
deep
fried
fish
taste
is
different
than
i
expected
and
dissimilar
from
other
pale
ales
that
ive
had
that
sour
note
i
detected
in
my
nose
comes
through
as
slightly
acidic
pleasant
and
altogether
unique
predominant
flavor
is
a
dry
slightly
roasted
malt
backbone
supported
by
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
the
carbonation
light
and
very
fine
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
inspired
my
to
try
more
english
pale
ales
d
i
have
had
this
ale
several
times
and
will
continue
to
seek
it
out
i
really
enjoy
it
smooth
nice
pale
perhaps
a
bit
thin
but
its
good
drinking
this
ones
been
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
well
over
a
year
so
its
overdue
it
pours
cool
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
pretty
solid
amber
color
and
a
decent
frothy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
all
over
the
place
the
aroma
is
very
mild
with
hints
of
honey
and
caramel
orange
wheat
pleasant
but
hard
to
define
the
first
taste
is
firm
malt
grain
and
wheat
bread
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
its
a
pretty
clean
flavor
with
a
vague
smokiness
almost
peaty
the
body
feel
is
nice
middle
of
the
road
drinkable
stuff
not
too
much
sweetness
here
some
grassy
dryness
but
not
too
much
likeable
ale
definitely
recommended
could
session
this
as
long
as
i
had
some
eats
to
mellow
out
the
bite
a
bit
drinkability
a
rather
fullflavored
session
ale
with
a
keen
drinkability
worth
a
try
pours
a
really
nice
deep
golden
copper
like
colour
with
an
off
white
head
sweet
malty
like
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
the
label
says
it
all
for
the
taste
crisp
dry
and
bittersweet
practically
no
lacing
the
level
of
carbonation
makes
this
beer
pretty
quaffable
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
the
holy
grail
ale
i
had
a
few
days
ago
cant
wait
to
have
another
d
notes
well
balanced
great
sessionability
d
very
easy
to
drink
has
the
sweetness
with
a
bitter
kick
at
end
nice
amber
aleish
well
carbonated
with
a
tingly
mouthfeel
this
would
be
very
nice
after
a
long
hot
summer
day
and
a
great
session
beer
with
some
hotdogs
and
hamburgers
sessionable
at
4
4
abv
also
quite
flavourful
needless
to
say
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
example
of
the
style
and
is
something
i
would
certainly
recommend
to
fans
of
the
english
pa
drinkability
is
great
great
english
pale
ale
drinks
easily
very
smooth
and
has
a
great
flavor
to
it
at
4
4
abv
its
a
nice
session
beer
or
just
something
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
check
it
out
overall
a
classic
english
pa
could
be
a
goto
beer
if
it
werent
so
expensive
at
4
4
this
is
fairly
sessionable
and
what
a
pleasant
session
it
would
be
not
quite
as
good
as
the
sam
smith
organic
ale
my
favourite
pa
of
all
time
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
d
pretty
high
drinkability
low
in
abv
and
full
in
flavor
went
well
with
the
bowl
of
chili
and
the
polenta
cake
i
was
having
drinkability
in
this
humble
beer
drinkers
opinion
the
quintessential
session
beer
its
loaded
with
flavor
and
character
but
its
light
enough
and
low
enough
in
alcohol
to
make
this
one
to
enjoy
all
night
long
which
is
just
how
the
brits
drink
their
pales
and
bitters
flavors
are
not
in
your
face
but
relaxed
no
lack
i
could
drink
this
for
a
long
minute
d
would
be
easy
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
and
i
could
imagine
they
would
get
better
with
each
one
but
then
again
what
beer
doesnt
a
great
try
perfect
beer
with
fish
and
chips
taste
and
aroma
are
very
well
done
an
example
of
how
good
this
style
of
beer
can
really
be
if
you
havent
had
an
english
pale
ale
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
very
different
than
an
ipa
or
apa
so
if
you
are
somewhat
afraid
of
a
strong
hop
character
you
may
really
like
this
one
ooooh
thats
damn
good
its
got
the
hair
on
the
back
of
my
standing
up
delicate
crispy
carbonation
eats
away
at
some
of
the
best
head
an
english
pale
gal
ever
gave
me
butter
toffee
is
squeezing
a
sexy
pair
of
big
hops
the
backdrop
is
so
pleasant
the
tummy
welcomes
the
treat
and
burps
for
more
the
dry
finish
is
having
me
pilsner
my
pants
i
gotta
hook
up
with
this
black
sheep
again
just
next
time
im
gunna
put
it
in
her
glass
an
orange
brown
color
with
a
modest
centimeter
of
head
grainy
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
some
fruitiness
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
an
extension
of
aroma
husky
grains
followed
by
sweetness
an
english
bitterness
prevails
at
the
finish
fairly
light
and
pleasing
on
the
palate
slight
carbonation
a
good
clean
balanced
english
ale
this
was
my
first
beer
from
the
black
sheep
brewery
and
it
most
certainly
wont
be
the
last
bloody
fine
brew
the
feel
is
thick
and
milky
has
the
feel
of
a
nice
english
pub
ale
leaves
a
little
milky
film
still
its
smoothdrinkin
overall
its
big
and
milky
thick
and
sweet
not
bad
but
not
one
id
crave
it
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
i
guess
it
could
have
been
worse
there
could
have
been
malted
corn
or
rice
in
here
this
one
has
session
written
all
over
it
d
in
general
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nonetheless
golden
with
a
slight
chill
haze
1
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
at
14
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
malts
and
herbal
hops
clean
nose
caramel
malts
up
front
followed
by
grassy
herbal
hops
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
subtle
but
complex
at
the
same
time
surprised
by
the
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
end
of
this
beer
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
will
drink
again
md
easy
to
drink
and
really
light
in
the
mouth
slightly
bitter
and
not
really
sweet
d
i
was
expecting
something
totally
different
but
i
got
a
very
nice
refreshing
ale
this
is
highly
drinkable
dig
this
brew
a
decent
find
its
not
a
bad
drop
but
it
doesnt
have
a
huge
amount
of
complexity
to
it
drinkable
enough
in
its
way
but
there
are
english
pales
i
like
a
whole
lot
more
whoa
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
of
my
taste
medlow
carbonation
smooth
as
hell
though
sweet
palate
malty
finish
with
a
light
leafy
hop
edge
mouth
coating
spice
comes
back
just
a
bit
metallic
lightly
herbal
tealike
in
the
finish
which
ends
up
rather
bitter
yes
my
favourite
epa
for
sure
mfd
this
brew
is
smooth
and
tingly
to
the
mouth
but
has
an
moderate
feel
the
16
9
ounce
size
is
perfect
it
is
very
drinkable
but
that
is
plenty
for
me
after
this
one
you
will
have
quite
the
malt
mouth
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
in
color
but
not
super
dark
decent
head
had
a
decent
malty

it
again
and
am

to
try
some
of
the
other
by
this
company
d
pretty
drinkable
overall
ok
taste
but
as
the
beer
went
on
it
lost
flavor
and
overall
quality
the
thin
mouthfeel
also
did
not
compliment
the
beer
as
well
but
it
was
still
pretty
smooth
and
overall
not

bad
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not

this
is

beer
to
drink
several
of
throughout
the
entire
evening
a
good
tasty
beer
i
liked
the

smell
the
hop
taste
was
there
but
not
overwhelming
i
didnt
notice
an
alcohol
taste
the

mentioned
a

i
was
somewhat
underwhelmed
by
this

is
this
a

i
do
not
know
but
it
does
not
taste
like
what
any
of
the
other
reviewers
describe
notes
not
that
tasty
at
first
it
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
but
it
just
has
such
a
dry
finish
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
it
is
also
just
a
little
bland
and
a
watered
down
kind
of
taste
ive
had
better
somewhat
uneven
but
overall
a
tasty
and
extremely
quaffable
ale
the
beer
poured
an

the
nose
had
some

no

of
note
the
flavor
was
mostly
caramel
touched
wtih
honey
finishing
with
a
nice
bitter
as
expected
in
an
english
beer
the
feel
was
thin
to
moderate
nothing
real
special

the
drinkability
was
not
bad

not

a

with

not

two
fingers
plenty
of
victorian
lace
sticks
to
the

giving
the
impression
that
doilies
are
stuck
on
the
glass
beautiful
to
look
at
first
smell
oooh
pleasant
i
have
the
feeling
after
i
eventually
finish
this
divine
nectar
my
nose
will
still
be
inside
the
glass
sniffing
at
what
once
was
big
bold
malts
yeast
and
butter
that
reminds
me
of
a
bakery
light
pears
and
green
apples
even
toffee
smell
this
beer
and
the
mind
wanders
to
an
old
england
countryside
where
bicycles
still
outnumber
the
automobile
the
taste
oh
the
taste
beautiful
big
malt
profile
upfront
mellowed
by
a
diacetyl
flavour
and
texture
soon
follows
a
light
fruit
presence
pears
apples
and
even
a
bit
of
apple
cider
toffee
on
the
tongue
as
well
accompanied
by
a
dark
friend
is
it
coffee
could
it
be
dark
chocolate
i
cant
quite
tell
but
i
also
dont
care
its
enjoyable
thats
all
that
matters
for
simplicity
ill
say
its
both
smooth
full
bodied
and
heavy
mouthfeel
that
gives
the
illusion
im
not
drinking
beer
im
drinking
nectar
given
by
god
himself
drinkable
too
damn
drinkable
and
too
damn
good
ive
got
half
a
glass
left
and
i
dont
want
to
finish
it
knowing
that
once
its
finished
its
gone
and
i
cant
get
another
bottle
for
quite
some
time
a
terrific
beer
i
highly
suggest
seeking
this
out
to
anyone
and
everyone
who
likes
a
good
wholesome
ale
this
beer
pours
orange
and
tan
with
a
thick
lasting
head
its
quite
cloudy
aroma
is
mild
and
earthy
taste
is
biscuit
maltiness
balanced
by
mild
hops
mild
winey
flavor
finish
is
clean
and
dry
light
to
medium
bodied
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
satisfying
session
ale
i
like
simple
english
pales
and
this
is
a
great
study
aide
plus
its
lower
abv
doesnt
interfere
yeah
dont
listen
to
me
its
a
fine
ale
sweet
and
bitter
citric
and
smooth
quite
a
nice
little
brew
go
knock
ourselves
out
a
very
good
bitter
pale
ale
whatever
it
has
a
nice
copper
color
and
starts
off
with
a
nice
head
the
taste
has
very
good
fruit
flavor
combined
with
a
noticeable
hoppiness
some
sips
werent
as
good
as
others
but
im
not
sure
why
in
the
middle
of
my
beer
i
got
a
slice
of
angel
food
cake
with
pineapple
icing
perfect
the
pineapplelike
fruit
tastes
in
the
beer
complemented
the
cake
perfectly
i
would
highly
suggest
doing
something
similar
the
bitterness
helps
the
food
match
as
well
good
balance
and
a
surpisingly
crisp
finish
lead
to
excellent
drinkibility
an
interesting
brew
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
though
the
taste
was
bitter
with
some
hop
astringency
there
was
little
malt
character
and
it
felt
somewhat
thin
today
august
1st
is
yorkshire
day
as
a
proud
yorkshireman
myself
this
yorkshire
beer
is
raised
high
to
all
my
mates
back
in
yorkshire
england
including
my
fellow
tyke
ba
and
good
friend
bsf
who
i
met
at
easter
and
whom
is
ironically
betraying
the
clan
by
spending
his
yorkshire
day
darn
sarf
at
the
gbbf
oh
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
it
beefs
up
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
from
the
carbonation
and
the
texture
of
the
hops
in
all
this
reminds
me
a
great
deal
of
the
english
bitter
that
i
just
sampled
rather
than
a
pale
but
it
is
an
okay
speciman
either
way
not
something
that
i
would
turn
into
a
session
beer
though
i
had
to
nurse
this
one
although
this
beer
makes
the
oftmade
mistake
of
removing
its
ringwood
yeast
it
is
good
even
after
filtering
and
pastuerising
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
in
its
true
form
notes
beer
has
a
nice
feel
on
the
tongue
session
quality
aroma
seems
more
pleasant
and
interesting
than
the
taste
the
taste
was
a
decent
mix
of
malt
and
hops
but
i
think
the
hops
won
out
in
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
very
dry
and
a
bit
nutty
the
low
level
carbonation
makes
this
a
easy
beer
to
put
down
and
one
sip
naturally
leads
you
to
another
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
barrier
this
would
be
in
my
usual
list
it
went
down
easy
and
i
probably
could
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
a
mediocre
ale
not
a
bad
little
ale
this
is
a
great
brew
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangey
color
the
carbonation
is
very
mild
the
head
is
pure
white
and
long
lasting
leaving
very
solid
lace
behind
the
nose
is
of
copious
bitter
and
aroma
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
the
taste
is
very
complex
with
cedary
resiny
hops
dominating
there
is
also
a
dry
yeastyness
that
is
very
evident
and
pleasant
the
malt
is
definitely
in
the
background
but
to
me
this
is
a
good
thing
i
sense
a
slight
astringency
in
the
finish
though
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
i
like
the
low
carbonation
highly
drinkable
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
less
filling
than
lagers
etc
i
could

several
of
these
back

is

things

there
are

in
there
as

taste

do

well
as

is

balanced
very
nicely
the
hopping
comes
off
to
me
as
minty
quite
appropriate
in
the
mix
body
is
again
medium
to
light
with
a
mineral
twang
no
doubt
from
the
water
used
finishes
balanced
with
a
lingering
metallic
singe
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
a
fine
english
ale
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
and
well
see
if
it
does
not
disappoint
the
color
is
like
a
summer
brewed
iced
tea
the
head
is
creamy
and
rich
almost
like
sea
foam
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
fruity
and
pungent
earthy
grains
emanate
from
the
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
sweetness
the
taste
is
light
fruity
and
finishes
dry
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
dry
cherries
medium
body
of
malt
hops
are
earthy
and
give
the
beer
a
flavor
of
grassy
rawness
a
very
enjoyable
and
flavorful
english
ale
yummy
more
orange
in
color
than
amber
with
a
thin
vail
of
head
and
not
much
stick
aromas
are
dominated
by
bitter
as
is
the
taste
the
bitter
is
more
of
the
bitter
found
in
black
licorice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
crisp
the
finish
is
clean
with
a
mild
citrus
and
even
some
ripe
pear
or
apple
flavors
showing
this
is
a
sound
brew
but
nothing
astounding
though
i
bet
it
would
be
much
better
on
tap
good
pour
a
somewhat
cloudyappearing
amber
color
with
brownishyellow
coppery
highlights
good
frothy
head
of
large
creamcolored
bubbles
with
decent
cling
that
stays
steady
at
about
one
finger
deep
freshly
yeasty
up
front
in
the
aroma
with
mild
breadiness
not
much
malt
to
speak
of
hops
are
soft
and
fruity
with
a
greenapple
character
flavor
is
also
yeasty
at
the
outset
immediately
this
is
a
very
british
pale
ale
with
warmth
flavors
emerge
suggesting
rye
bread
caraway
seeds
and
fruit
particularly
green
apple
and
even
banana
leafy
hop
with
a
twang
that
develops
substantially
with
warmth
mouthfeel
is
firm
smooth
lightly
carbonated
and
with
a
decent
hop
tingle
aftertaste
lingery
with
some
chewiness
good
drinkability
after
sampling
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
for
review
i
matched
up
the
rest
of
this
beer
with
a
pot
roast
to
very
good
effect
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
but
not
to
the
point
where
ill
be
consistently
shelling
out
4
00
per
bottle
overall
impression
all
in
all
a
good
beer
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
taste
thusly
the
hop
bitterness
gets
a
little
puckering
not
sure
where
the
beer
fits
in
the
quality
spectrum
of
englishmade
beer
as
whole
though
poured
a
dark
goldorange
colour
with
a
big
white
head
that
left
lots
of
lace
nose
that
was
lots
of
malt
with
maybe
some
oranges
a
wonderful
taste
greets
the
tongue
malt
and
some
hops
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
the
beer
felt
alive
in
the
mouth
and
the
aftertaste
was
wonderfully
hoppy
just
the
bitterness
i
like
good
stuff
the
stronger
than
usual
ale
aftertaste
is
just
what
i
look
for
a
darned
good
brew
the
aftertaste
is
clean
and
not
assertive
bitterness
remains
not
blown
away
but
very
quaffable
if
your
in
for
a
session
beer
this
is
it
if
your
looking
for
an
adventure
then
maybe
not
overall
another
nice
ale
from
black
sheep
brewery
that
was
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
my
only
fault
with
it
was
the
high
ester
content
in
the
finish
that
could
become
overpowering
for
many
people
imho
pourred
a
very
nice
copper
brew
with
a
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
disapear
a
bit
quickly
good
malt
nose
and
taste
until
i
feel
the
sharp
sour
and
metallic
aftertaste
wow
such
a
great
start
but
a
very
disapointing
ending
below
average
for
this
one
but
i
would
still
be
curious
to
try
other
product
from
this
brewery
orange
gold
color
head
is
about
medium
white
and
frothy
aroma
is
malty
and
earthy
with
a
hint
of
fruit
sweetness
a
lighter
to
medium
bodied
bitter
malts
are
mild
touches
of
fruit
and
a
little
earthy
hops
are
slightly
spicy
a
fairly
mild
english
bitter
taste
is
a
little
watery
but
it
has
a
really
nice
yeastiness
and
fruitiness
to
the
flavor
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
thin
finish
is
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
is
fruity
and
sweet
this
one
pours
a
slightly
amber
color
with
a
moderate
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
and
a
little
sweet
nothing
too
impressive
there
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
but
not
extremely
exciting
i
could
see
having
several
of
these
and
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
source
liquid
solutions
a
cloudy
golden
colour
with
little
head
left
a
small
delicate
lace
on
the
glass
pleasant
moderately
strong
smell
with
good
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
all
around
good
brew
fairly
typical
english
ale
this
one
almost
reminds
me
of
belhaven
scottish
ale
a
great
brew
for
the
money
and
considering
the
style
it
is
a
typical
english
ale
which
can
be
both
good
and
bad
good
in
the
sense
that
this
was
a
quality
brew
with
nice
solid
malt
some
biscuit
and
ample
broad
hops
bittering
bad
in
the
sense
that
this
ale
was
pretty
onedimensional
once
you
get
past
the
upfront
flavors
there
is
just
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
monochromatic
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
musty
with
hint
of
maltiness
the
traditional
residue
of
english
ale
yeast
is
present
the
taste
is
terrible
the
beer
is
quite
watery
bitter
slightly
malty
musty
and
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
a
light
bodied
beer
smooth
dry
but
in
need
of
carbonation
it
drinks
fine
although
its
unlikely
for
me
to
ever
have
another
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
medium
sized
white
head
with
finesmall
bubbles
the
head
was
longlasting
with
this
beer
and
the
body
was
somewhat
cloudy
with
no
carbonation
observed
the
hue
was
orange
and
the
lacing
was
excellent
the
nose
was
somewhat
hoppy
and
the
flavor
was
bitter
with
a
fore
and
aftertaste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
tingly
on
my
tongue
not
bad
for
a
bitter
as
it
was
not
as
bitter
as
i
was
anticipating
poured
up
a
good
rough
head
over
a
clear
nicely
copperish
beer
the
head
didnt
hang
around
but
the
beer
still
showed
good
lace
every
step
of
the
way
soft
nutty
earthy
smell
hoppy
bitter
and
dry
stays
on
the
mouth
bitter
and
slightly
metallic
for
some
time
a
comfortable
enough
drink
but
not
something
id
go
looking
for
toward
the
end
the
sourness
changed
to
bittersweet
this
is
a
beer
to
linger
over
because
it
evolves
interesting
got
to
get
some
more
of
these
half
a
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
2
massive
fingers
of
head
the
head
really
sticks
around
and
the
lacing
is
nice
the
smell
is
fruity
with
some
hops
aroma
and
a
little
butter
diacetyl
the
taste
is
fairly
hoppy
for
a
pale
and
has
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
maybe
nutmeg
or
clove
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
fairly
nice
mouthfeel
as
well
the
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
i
could
drink
plenty
of
this
classic
english
ale
not
entirely
spectacular
but
still
a
solid
pale
ale
good
head
cloudy
orangeamber
coloration
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
the
aftertaste
reminds
you
youve
been
drinking
a
good
pale
ale
long
after
you
finish
it
most
notable
is
the
bottle
though
which
is
not
only
adorned
with
hop
vines
but
also
weighs
in
at
about
a
deuce
and
a
half
500
ml
bottle
not
bottleconditioned
best
before
end
of
march
2003
i
had
this
at
the
classic
city
brewfest
in
athens
this
year
i
was
less
than
impressed
by
this
ive
had
some
other
bitters
before
but
this
had
perhaps
the
highest
diacetyl
level
ive
had
in
a
beer
and
im
not
really
all
that
perceptive
to
the
flavor
just
a
soso
bitter
oh
well
here
goes
the
real
review
a
muddy
deep
amber
color
on
the
pour
head
is
modest
and
frothy
light
tan
in
color
as
it
erodes
a
fine
sheet
of
lace
clings
mightily
to
the
glass
fresh
malt
and
lightly
sweet
is
the
nose
start
is
lightly
sweet
thickly
malt
the
top
is
middling
in
feel
finish
is
a
tad
tart
mildly
acidic
the
hops
pleasing
in
their
spicy
bitterness
quite
dry
and
a
drinkable
beer
well
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
english
ales
prost
in
britain
clear
shiny
copper
in
color
creamy
full
rich
offwhite
fluffy
head
laced
the
glass
nicely
and
stayed
in
clumps
all
the
was
to
the
bottom
smell
was
somewhat
acidic
floral
and
faint
citrus
some
faint
metallic
smells
taste
was
very
much
traditional
english
bitter
nice
crisp
hop
presence
lots
of
citrus
grapefruit
tart
flavors
sticky
hop
resin
to
it
at
times
which
is
a
good
thing
to
me
very
good
flavors
minimal
malt
presence
which
is
perfectly
fine
this
beer
really
grows
on
you
and
turns
out
very
impressive
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
just
right
made
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
before
i
knew
it
my
glass
was
empty
perfect
with
grilled
chicken
red
potatos
meal
a
very
good
english
ale
i
had
this
tonight
in
honor
of
the

what
a
great
event
the
first
thing
you
notice
about
this
beer
is
the
tremendous
solid
rocky
white
head
it
leaves
a
web
of
lace
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
subtly
hoppy
this
is
a
very
dry
cidery
beer
with
woody
characteristics
the
finish
has
great
balance
and
a
lingering
bitterness
overall
a
great
beer
certainly
worth
trying
orangey
body
is
topped
by
a
huge
active
fluffy
sticky
head
leaving
excellent
lacing
behind
nose
is
hoppy
fruity
and
a
pinch
of
british
sulfur
taste
has
fruits
apples
vying
with
malt
sweetness
wrapped
up
in
a
buttery
blend
and
a
bit
of
hop
bite
in
the
end
a
really
sterling
example
of
english
bitter
notes
i
am
quite
pleased
with
this
brew
flavours
and
aromas
bouncing
all
over
with
an
impressive
head
all
of
this
is
the
big
picture
for
what
an
english
ale
is
supposed
to
be
kind
of
edgy
bland
flavour
nice
hop
bite
and
decent
slightly
roasted
bitterness
but
doesnt
do
enough
to
excite
me
slight
watery
finish
i
will
give
it
another
go
after
seeing
its
decent
ratings
but
i
cant
really
see
myself
liking
it
that
much
this
beer
is
really
good
beautiful
copper
colored
brew
with
nice
lace
head
that
follows
the
brew
to
the
bottom
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
that
lead
to
crisp
dry
finish
nice
bitter
from
black
sheep
copper
beneath
a
thin
and
sticky
head
well
balanced
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hop
with
a
mildly
tart
and
fruity
finish
more
flavor
than
some
other
brews
that
like
to
call
themselves
esbs
pricy
but
worth
a
try
d
ok
not
much
here
yet
would
be
nice
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
while
not
one
of
the
all
time
great
beers
i
really
enjoyed
stone
mill
opa
im
not
sure
if
the
reason
this
gets
such
a
bad
knock
is
because
of
the
anheuserbusch
connection
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
drinkability
a
subpar
pale
ale
its
pretty
drinkable
but
the
taste
is
pretty
bad
you
could
do
worse
but
this
beer
isnt
really
worth
trying
dont
waste
your
time
or
your
money
this
organic
pale
ale
sort
of
pales
for
the
style
pours
a
light
copper
with
little
head
and
very
light
carbonation
the
smells
were
nonexistent
on
the
beers
i
tried
poured
or
from
the
bottle
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
and
has
a
finish
with
some
hop
characteristics
but
could
use
some
more
body
and
flavor
the
carbonation
is
mild
at
best
and
lacking
punch
not
a
beer
i
will
be
sampling
again
overall
it
was
ok
had
it
on
the
bartenders
recommendation
first
pint
was
a
bust
sour
infected
keg
he
came
back
with
a
taste
and
gave
me
a
free
pint
overall
not
bad
but
not
a
real
seeker
either
the
balance
is
way
out
of
whack
englishstyled
or
not
bad
is
bad
and
so
is
this
taste
a
sweet
maltiness
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
nothing
overpowering
but
nothing
special
either
d
a
little
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
are
better
and
several
other
organic
beers
that
are
better
as
well
this
is
not
something
id
recommend
to
anyone
id
be
better
able
to
tell
what
was
going
on
without
the
metal
in
there
i
wont
be
finishing
this
one
although
its
a
shame
as
i
dont
have
anything
else
in
the
fridge
d
not
drinkable
had
to
pour
out
if
the
taste
wasnt
so
bad
it
would
be
a
refreshing
beer
a
tasty
and
sexy
organic
brew
organic
pale
ale
pours
full
amber
with
an
average
white
head
and
moderate
lacings
aroma
is
floral
hops
taste
is
mildly
bitter
pale
ale
very
mild
for
the
style
good
choice
for
a
session
pa
a
bit
slick
and
smooth
with
no
bready
yeast
component
says
origin
merrimack
new
hampshire
fairly
light
body
carbonation
seems
appropriate
pretty
dry
finish
while
bland
its
still
an
easy
drinker
this
isnt
something
ill
be
going
back
for
d
this
beer
definitely
grew
on
me
as
the
session
went
on
but
it
never
really
blew
me
away
as
far
as
pale
ales
are
concerned
its
good
but
not
great
drinkability
is
alright
though
you
could
definitely
have
a
few
it
wasnt
like
i
wanted
to
put
it
down
this
beer
has
no
character
no
hops
no
complex
flavors
and
no
business
being
bought
by
anyone
other
than
people
with
an
undying
devotion
to
anheuser
i
could
see
this
maybe
as
being
bought
for
a
party
or
get
together
as
an
alternative
to
the
keg
then
again
if
youre
drinking
bud
why
would
you
pay
more
for
the
same
thing
disappointing
and
not
really
one
to
recommend
heck
i
am
green
and
this
is
organic
id
rather
have
an
old
milwaukee
all
in
all
this
one
impressed
me
i
did
not
know
it
was
an
anhieser
busch
product
drank
this
one
with
a
steak
and
a
side
of
potatoes
not
too
bad
i
figure
this
one
could
go
well
with
chicken
or
soup
i
am
going
to
try
to
find
this
one
around
town
give
it
a
second
try
overall
highly
recomend
this
one
very
smooth
i
think
this
is
a
fine
though
not
extraordinary
example
of
pale
ale
that
focuses
more
on
ester
and
malt
than
on
hops
it
could
be
more
exciting
if
there
were
a
greater
hop
presence
to
interact
with
the
esters
in
my
opinion
its
rather
subdued
bitterness
and
moderated
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
make
for
a
very
drinkable
brew
though
pours
a
midlevel
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
initial
head
and
a
little
lacing
decent
scent
a
little
bit
of
jerkyish
enlgish
hops
and
maybe
some
more
floral
american
as
well
very
malty
taste
for
a
pale
ale
slight
bitterness
but
mostly
sweet
goes
down
very
smooth
its
best
attribute
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
had
a
more
malty
and
less
hoppy
pale
ale
that
wasnt
horrible
still
id
rather
have
a
decent
bitter
than
this
pale
added
after
i
read
bros
reviews
i
had
no
idea
this
was
an
ab
beer
i
certainly
hope
that
the
brewers
did
not
sacrifice
flavor
in
the
effort
to
remain
organic
but
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
certainly
lacking
in
this
one
i
can
understand
why
its
a
popular
choice
what
with
all
of
the
budmillercoors
drinkers
out
there
as
this
ale
is
about
as
rich
in
character
as
any
of
those
dear
abyou
dont
have
to
trick
me
i
respect
you
for
longevity
and
hugeness
you
must
be
doing
something
right
and
i
want
to
like
you
but
pulling
stunts
like
this
knocks
you
backwards
about
10
notches
be
honest
hold
your
head
up
i
mean
you
are
number
one
arent
you
you
should
know
better
and
i
think
you
do
this
is
like
something
a
general
motors
executive
would
do
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
appearance
a
nice
copper
color
with
was
very
appealing
the
beer
was
way
too
watery
and
unflavorful
not
much
going
on
for
hops
no
lacing
or
head
at
all
not
much
diff
than
a
light
beer
except
for
the
cool
color
the
whole
organic
thing
doesnt
mean
anything
to
me
either
so
basically
just
a
substandard
beer
move
on
pours
nicely
fluffy
head
and
a
lightly
colored
pale
ale
smell
is
alright
some
maltiness
but
a
strange
metallic
note
taste
is
much
the
same
no
real
hop
presence
and
faint
maltiness
followed
by
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
the
nose
hinted
at
another
average
anheuserbusch
effort
not
sure
ill
ever
be
impressed
with
one
of
their
beers
at
this
point
nikki
d
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
other
options
should
be
higher
on
your
list
due
to
the
underhopping
and
poor
feel
d
nice
session
beer
isnt
the
most
interesting
beer
but
still
quite
drinkable
it
smells
crisp
and
you
can
detect
the
hops
on
first
whiff
the
beer
tastes
like
a
crisp
american
style
pale
ale
it
is
smooth
and
the
fact
that
it
is
organic
is
forgotten
because
of
the
pleasing
taste
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
helps
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
meh
this
beer
just
isnt
very
good
and
is
somewhat
confusing
as
a
pale
ale
it
looks
fine
foamy
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
not
leaving
much
behind
it
smells
malty
hops
are
notably
missing
i
guess
it
has
a
balanced
flavor
but
im
not
certain
thats
a
compliment
here
its
mostly
malt
but
its
kind
of
like
a
good
beer
in
some
other
style
unfortunately
its
also
a
bit
watery
and
fizzy
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
a
free
one
sorry
the
drinkability
category
doesnt
make
a
ton
of
sense
for
a
lot
of
beers
its
good
not
great
medium
body
appropriate
mouthfeel
for
the
style
all
around
a
pretty
decent
english
pale
ale
would
be
a
good
sessional
based
on
the
other
selections
at
this
hotel
bar
i
had
rather
low
expectations
for
this
draft
it
was
a
little
better
than
expected
but
not
much
dark
bar
made
it
tough
to
judge
appearance
but
whatever
leeway
i
was
prepared
to
give
was
counterbalanced
by
a
thin
to
non
existant
head
smell
wasnt
bad
just
barely
discernable
taste
was
that
of
a
conventional
mainstream
pa
except
for
an
odd
metallic
twang
that
my
palate
quickly
adjusted
to
it
could
just
as
easily
been
a
bass
run
of
the
stone
mill
english
pale
ale
not
a
bad
pale
ale
at
all
it
lacks
any
kind
of
wow
factor
but
its
pretty
solid
nevertheless
drinkability
good
nice
pale
to
session
with
sn
is
still
a
better
bet
d
decent
the
carbonation
is
a
little
intense
for
me
i
would
not
consider
this
to
be
a
session
beer
a
good
pale
ale
but
ive
truly
yet
to
find
an
organic
craft
brew
that
was
on
par
with
exceptional
i
visited
the
african
themed
bar
to
have
the
african
beer
and
ended
up
having
a
couple
american
microbrews
go
figure
cheers
oh
well
its
one
more
that
i
have
tried
but
i
wont
pick
it
up
again
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
its
not
that
its
that
bad
but
i
just
dont
really
like
anything
about
it
d
definitely
drinkable
i
can
see
myself
having
the
beer
again
being
organic
is
very
cool
as
well
da
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
distinctive
drinkability
this
one
really
took
the
pale
and
applied
it
to
all
of
the
beers
aspects
not
recommended
organic
or
not
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
but
not
overly
impressive
wolavers
offers
a
more
impressive
line
of
organics
but
this
is
alright
too
worth
a
try
the
taste
unfortunately
doesnt
rise
to
the
same
level
it
starts
out
decently
well
fruity
with
a
little
caramel
and
toasty
grain
a
hint
of
earth
and
citrus
and
lingering
bitter
pine
it
soon
degrades
however
becoming
more
bland
and
too
acloholic
with
food
it
is
rough
and
alcoholic
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
golden
orange
in
color
and
has
a
small
off
white
head
which
dissipates
immediately
the
nose
is
slightly
sulfury
like
cooked
cabbage
some
slight
malt
and
not
detectable
hops
the
taste
is
slightly
acetic
and
has
strange
hop
bitterness
not
very
impressed
with
this
offering
the
nose
and
the
taste
do
not
work
well
the
taste
is
slightly
out
of
balance
would
not
recommend
this
beer
nor
would
i
keep
it
in
the
fridge
d
all
said
this
is
still
a
relatively
satisfying
thirst
quencher
and
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
falls
short
in
several
areas
and
at
best
seems
to
pull
itself
up
to
average
perhaps
this
beer
could
be
a
gateway
microbrew
for
light
beer
drinkers
i
went
to
review
this
beer
and
found
it
under
green
valley
brewing
company
thats
funny
the
big
brewery
where
i
drank
it
said
budweiser
on
it
fairfield
ca
brewery
tour
poured
a
nice
one
finger
head
into
a
glass
the
beer
had
a
nice
copperamber
color
to
it
nice
balance
taste
with
an
emphasis
on
hops
i
think
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
pale
ale
is
not
favorite
style
based
on
this
one
and
some
others
i
think
bud
can
brew
micros
if
they
need
to
i
can
find
no
faults
with
this
offering
i
find
it
lacking
drinkability
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
but
it
isnt
totally
bad
not
to
impressed
and
thats
what
i
thought
before
i
saw
the
ab
label
an
overwhelming
smell
and
taste
of
alcohol
this
beer
lacked
where
pale
ales
should
be
successful
overall
a
very
unremarkable
beer
the
next
beer
i
had
that
evening
was
something
else
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
a
good
beer
that
you
will
want
to
take
your
time
and
enjoy
aboveaverage
drinkability
a
few
of
these
could
go
down
easy
particularly
in
warmer
weather
final
note
only
after
doing
my
review
did
i
read
that
this
beer
is
an
ab
product
and
it
doesnt
change
what
i
think
of
the
beer
i
drank
my
guess
i
should
of
got
to
thisone
sooner
not
bad
but
now
that
ive
had
it
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
the
character
of
this
ale
is
not
offensive
at
all
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
this
would
be
a
good
intro
pale
ale
for
someone
who
has
never
had
a
pale
ale
nothing
memorable
all
told
a
decent
beer
at
best
but
nothing
more
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
if
offered
one
with
no
better
choices
available
id
drink
it
ahhh
it
was
mediocre
had
from
bottle
at
claim
jumper
scottsdale
poured
as
a
typical
pale
noy
much
head
carbonation
or
lacing
very
little
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
citrousy
and
floral
not
really
complex
with
backbone
i
have
had
better
pales
but
i
have
had
worse
to
in
a
pinch
it
would
be
good
smooth
drinking
but
more
woody
than
i
would
have
like
this
organics
always
seem
to
lack
any
real
character
or
body
somewhat
lifeless
drinkability
would
remain
good
for
a
full
sixer
but
i
wouldnt
be
motivated
to
do
so
d
over
all
i
would
say
this
is
just
an
average
beer
nothing
to
say
wow
about
but
it
is
much
better
than
the
other
ab
beers
d
even
though
there
was
not
one
area
where
this
beer
was
great
all
the
areas
came
together
to
really
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
golden
orange
with
a
thick
head
smell
is
vaguely
grassy
and
hoppy
taste
is
a
bit
grassy
with
a
hint
of
butter
that
i
do
not
really
go
for
and
a
slight
hop
finish
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
props
for
being
organic
but
this
is
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
some
caramel
and
malt
tones
maybe
a
hint
of
hoppiness
and
bitter
but
this
has
a
strange
skunky
aftertaste
that
is
simply
not
appealing
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
avoid
judging
however
by
the
reviews
of
my
colleagues
i
suspect
that
the
particular
bottle
i
tried
had
been
sold
past
its
shelf
life
i
hhoto
have
another
opportunity
to
review
a
fresh
bottle
later
not
bad
for
an
introduction
to
craft
beer
if
you
are
trying
to
get
your
friends
to
switch
over
give
them
this
if
its
for
you
your
not
missing
much
the
stone
mill
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
very
little
foam
head
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
some
nice
hop
aroma
and
the
taste
rounds
it
out
with
a
piney
ness
it
is
a
fairly
thin
beer
that
leaves
it
mark
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
back
of
the
throat
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
i
have
tried
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
that
exciting
either
it
tastes
a
bit
off
to
me
a
decent
pale
ale
but
not
the
clean
crisp
taste
of
hops
on
malt
that
the
style
calls
for
i
wont
buy
this
again
but
i
will
continue
to
look
for
the
great
organic
beer
this
beer
is
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
medium
thin
and
creamy
white
head
with
quick
dissipation
little
lacing
is
evident
mildly
malty
and
hoppy
aroma
lightbodied
and
moderately
malty
with
a
light
hops
presence
as
well
very
little
else
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
the
finish
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
spice
this
is
a
forgettable
beer
d
decent
a
quaffer
a
totally
average
beer
for
the
most
part
iced
tea
color
with
a
thin
head
and
good
lacing
throughout
it
has
a
crisp
smell
of
oats
and
apple
with
some
carmel
and
malt
it
has
a
clean
wheat
flavor
some
more
malt
and
dry
grass
it
is
a
little
thin
but
has
a
peppery
carbonation
that
works
alright
its
very
passable
but
not
memorable
could
drink
plenty
of
them
with
no
offending
qualities
if
thats
what
floats
your
boat
d
quite
possible
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
the
beer
is
so
average
that
i
would
probably
not
buy
a
sixpack
to
do
so
stone
mill
organic
pale
ale
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
biscuity
malt
is
most
noticeable
in
the
aroma
just
a
touch
of
hops
too
well
the
flavor
is
pleasant
but
very
mild
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
well
balanced
very
clean
but
somehow
quite
lacking
the
flavors
arent
bad
they
just
seem
too
muted
even
for
the
style
pleasant
enough
and
sessionable
worth
a
try
poured
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lace
what
little
head
there
was
left
quick
time
aroma
was
light
and
unremarkable
light
body
and
a
bit
overcarbonated
nice
deep
clear
amber
color
though
slighty
hoppy
and
quite
fruity
flavor
a
bit
of
malt
boring
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
poofy
for
me
theres
some
bitterness
but
it
doesnt
seem
quite
like
the
right
bitterness
needed
thought
this
had
session
potential
but
it
cloys
quickly
12oz
brown
bottle
pretty
amber
translucent
body
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
smell
is
feint
but
hints
at
malt
and
fruit
tastes
malty
fruity
and
just
slightly
nutty
just
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
toward
the
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
again
another
beer
from
them
that
tastes
stronger
and
better
than
it
smells
not
my
favorite
but
a
pretty
damn
decent
beer
not
too
bad
i
went
in
a
little
prejudiced
because
i
knew
this
was
actually
an
anheuserbusch
offering
there
are
definitely
much
better
pale
ales
but
for
an
ab
vehicle
not
bad
pours
amber
without
much
head
that
dissipated
quickly
flavor
was
malty
with
some
slight
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
ok
decent
but
surely
nothing
i
would
seek
out
tthis
is
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
nothing
too
complex
but
it
helps
wash
down
the
pizza
i
am
eating
refreshing
in
the
heat
12
oz
bottle
the
brew
is
crystal
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
finger
of
ivory
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coat
over
top
there
is
a
solid
carbonation
working
up
as
well
the
smell
is
light
caramel
light
diacetyl
moderate
bread
biscuit
and
grain
with
a
kiss
of
earthy
hop
overall
it
is
a
little
faint
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
biscuity
with
diacetyl
notes
finishing
with
a
mild
bitter
that
fades
after
a
few
seconds
on
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
bready
sweet
with
a
hint
of
earthyness
from
the
hop
there
is
something
about
the
combination
of
flavors
that
is
not
working
well
for
me
i
think
it
is
the
sweetness
and
breadyness
in
conflict
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
with
a
significant
drying
quality
overall
this
is
just
okay
the
hopping
doesnt
really
seem
to
come
through
on
the
aroma
or
the
flavor
other
than
bitterness
which
is
something
i
like
to
see
in
a
pale
ale
i
dont
see
another
bottle
of
this
working
into
my
collection
d
this
was
an
okay
beer
there
was
just
an
odd
spicy
aftertaste
drinkability
goes
down
well
if
you
can
forget
the
initial
aftertaste
drinkability
a
goodtasting
beer
easily
enjoyed
anytime
of
the
year
not
too
shabby
for
an
anheuser
busch
product
but
a
little
too
watery
i
poured
this
beer
into
mu
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
strawberry
blond
color
and
had
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
notgood
and
smelled
sour
to
me
with
a
hoppy
ringer
to
boot
the
beer
had
a
slighly
malty
taste
and
was
drinkable
but
not
very
refreshing
i
will
not
buy
again
just
because
i
dont
like
a
beer
the
stinks
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
the
sweetness
is
abundant
the
hops
play
along
in
their
woody
way
producing
a
bit
of
lemon
zing
they
are
more
prevalent
in
the
flavor
and
the
bitterness
strong
its
fairly
balanced
though
not
exciting
i
can
dig
it
though
certainly
could
drink
a
few
of
these
there
was
a
very
foamy
but
light
one
and
a
half
inches
thick
head
the
beer
itself
had
a
goldishbronzish
hue
that
is
very
clear
the
smell
was
primarily
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
the
taste
was
unique
and
very
good
it
was
a
light
flavor
but
one
where
you
could
taste
the
flavor
of
the
hops
it
was
a
very
orangey
hop
taste
with
slight
undertones
of
grapefruit
very
good
flavor
that
lasted
long
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
it
was
light
but
finished
good
not
too
dry
i
wasnt
too
impressed
before
but
this
time
it
drinks
great
plus
two
thumbs
up
for
it
being
an
organic
brew
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
somewhat
tasty
it
jsut
gets
borning
towards
the
end
not
great
but
considering
the
source
not
bad
either
light
orange
in
my
glass
with
a
thin
head
and
light
lacing
interesting
aroma
im
getting
butterscotch
malt
and
orange
hops
complex
taste
it
starts
off
bitter
but
that
fades
and
a
delightful
sweet
citrus
flavor
rises
very
long
finish
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
this
was
an
ab
product
and
organic
a
strange
world
we
live
in
medium
body
and
wellcarbonated
theres
something
offputting
about
this
beer
that
makes
me
glad
that
i
didnt
get
a
whole
sixpack
but
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
probably
wont
buy
it
again
for
home
consumption
but
its
much
better
than
most
macro
swill
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
some
bisquit
malts
its
balanced
with
a
mild
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
and
bitter
the
hop
finish
is
quite
nice
its
a
bit
grainy
with
some
residual
sweetness
probably
some
light
crystal
10l
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
its
highly
drinkable
with
a
well
balanced
flavor
and
aroma
drinkability
pretty
plain
the
sixer
will
be
enjoyed
little
to
no
chance
of
a
repurchase
though
decent
round
mouthfeel
starts
off
this
pleasant
though
not
exceptional
beer
toffee
malts
are
coupled
with
some
astringent
grassy
hops
probably
fuggles
which
im
not
a
fan
of
finish
is
dry
due
to
the
hops
and
somewhat
medicinal
a
decent
beer
that
im
guessing
has
a
low
abv
and
could
make
a
session
beer
out
of
if
youre
so
inclined
im
just
not
sure
its
good
enough
for
that
ha
ha
ha
ha
according
to
the
next
review
its
an
ab
beer
ha
ha
ha
ah
come
on
guys
fx
matt
actually
went
and
made
some
real
beer
what
are
you
waiting
for
d
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
coming
from
ab
obviously
its
not
the
best
ipa
on
the
market
but
dang
give
the
boys
some
credit
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
would
make
a
pretty
fine
session
beer
thank
you
ab
for
reviving
my
belief
in
the
macros
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
it
seems
bland
even
for
an
english
pale
ale
tastes
similar
to
an
amber
ale
taste
would
be
good
if
not
for
an
very
offputting
acidic
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
acidic
bitterness
almost
makes
the
beer
undrinkable
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
with
little
body
overall
its
a
neat
marketing
gimmick
by
ab
but
thats
all
it
is
a
marketing
gimmick
if
they
cared
about
the
beer
as
much
as
they
cared
about
the
fake
name
of
the
brewery
and
the
marketing
behind
the
beer
this
is
an
idea
that
could
work
for
ab
but
if
you
can
sell
a
shit
load
of
shitty
beer
why
make
the
beer
good
i
do
like
the
fact
its
organically
produced
but
this
ones
going
to
need
a
bit
more
oomph
before
it
becomes
something
ill
drink
regularly
i
would
recommend
this
as
the
best
3
point
beer
on
the
market
just
a
bit
above
boulevard
wheat
and
of
course
knowing
that
the
field
that
grew
the
barley
that
went
into
this
beer
didnt
have
pesticides
sprayed
on
it
make
this
an
even
more
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
three

that
fades
quickly
to

nothing

but
i
didnt
see
it
here
some
admirable
qualities
but
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
12
oz
bottle
with
some
code
according
to
the
website
its
brewed
with
metcalfe
and
harrington
barley
from
canada
and
cascade
and
hallertau
hops
from
the
pacific
nw
my
beer
was
brewed
in
new
hampshire
it
pours
crystalclear
a
few
shades
more
orange
than
gold
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
that
leads
up
to
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
small
collar
leaving
little
lacing
the
bouquet
is
lightly
sweet
and
consists
of
toasted
malts
caramel
and
citric
and
piney
almost
leafy
hops
the
flavor
is
essentially
the
same
but
with
notes
of
orange
and
a
medium
bitterness
it
is
quite
effervescent
with
a
light
dry
body
that
leaves
a
medium
finish
some
bottles
from
the
sixer
were
so
tingly
that
i
had
to
vigorously
swirl
the
beer
to
work
out
the
carbonation
to
make
it
more
drinkable
overall
its
not
too
bad
especially
for
ab
and
its
nice
to
see
them
making
an
effort
this
beer
may
be
listed
as
a
pale
ale
but
i
cannot
really
tell
it
apart
from
the
brewers
wild
hop
lager
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
little
head
the
smell
is
just
slightly
hoppy
with
a
little
vanilla
as
well
the
taste
is
more
like
a
mass
produced
lager
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
thus
drinkable
but
not
desirable
this
is
basically
budweiser
in
a
craft
beer
bottle
sold
at
craft
prices
not
good
ab
is
capable
of
so
much
more
honestly
i
know
this
is
made
by
ab
but
its
really
not
that
bad
is
it
the
best
pale
ale
out
there
no
but
its
pretty
solid
and
has
a
very
reasonable
price
point
i
paid
6
996er
i
think
it
is
wise
of
ab
to
keep
the
biterness
to
the
bare
minimum
with
this
one
as
thats
what
seems
to
hold
most
people
back
from
jumping
into
the
land
of
better
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
think
it
will
serve
its
purpose
in
the
marketplace
pours
a
clear
light
bronze
color
with
a
tall
foamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
webs
of
lace
on
the
walls
of
the
glass
as
it
recedes
nose
is
earthy
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
a
sugary
sweetness
taste
begins
with
toasted
malt
up
front
but
this
turns
to
more
of
a
breaddough
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
earthy
grassy
hops
follow
along
with
a
bit
of
tobacco
easydrinking
but
nothing
special
about
an
hour
or
so
after
drinking
this
beer
i
still
noticed
the
metallic
aftertaste
seemed
promising
at
first
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
one
again
i
was
unable
to
finish
this
drain
pour
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
albeit
a
little
fizzy
as
could
be
expected
from
an
ab
product
too
bad
it
seems
there
is
a
marketing
department
behind
it
trying
to
trick
consumers
into
thinking
it
is
a
micro
or
craft
pale
ale
from
a
craft
beer
drinkers
perspective
i
believe
it
would
be
more
respectable
for
ab
to
actually
put
their
name
on
this
that
would
make
it
somewhat
impressive
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
mega
swill
producers
want
a
piece
of
every
segment
of
the
beer
biz
and
this
is
ab
little
slice
of
the
organic
beer
market

green

ha
what
a
farce
thoroughly
forgetable
thank
god
i
only
purchased
a
single
bottle
and
not
a
sixer
the
taste
is
also
what
i
would
expect
from
an
anheiser
busch
affiliated
beer
lacking
there
is
a
slight
tinge
of
hoppiness
that
can
be
easily
missed
same
with
the
malt
good
levels
of
carbonation
make
for
a
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
that
one
would
also
expect
with
an
ab
beer
overall
a
disappointment
but
ill
live
to
drink
another
day
poured
from
a
12

a

eww
i
am
happy
that
ab
is
delving
outside
their
shitty
range
if
this
converts
1
person
i
call
it
a
job
well
done
the
college
kids
that
run
my
local
watering
hole
were
naturally
happy
with
the
new
addition
to
their
evergrowing
tap
list
and
after
the
fuss
raised
about
anheuserbuschs
stealth
marketing
tactics
i
was
likewise
naturally
eager
to
give
this
brew
a
shot
pours
a
brilliant
amber
in
color
quite
nice
to
look
at
with
an
offwhite

of
minimal
duration
and
with
minimal

with
no

and
a
bit
buttery
first

notes

very
low
apparent
bitterness
carbonation

a
combination

theres
also
some
of
that
cornysweet
goodness
that
ive
grown
accustomed
to
tasting
in
the
broad
american
macro
lager
style
i
had
probably
assumed
incorrectly
that
because
this
is
an
orgainc
offering
it
would
be
an
allmalt
brew
and
someone
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
its
diacetyl
and
dms
im
detecting
in
those
parenthetical
question
marks
up
above
with
the
youngs
special
fresh
in
my
mind
im
having
a
hard
time
seeing
this
as
an
english
pale
ale
offflavors
aside
it
seems
more
in
line
with
low
hop
bitterness
nofrills
american
pale
ale
also
im
not
a
macrohater
and
i
honestly
believe
that
a
beer
should
sell
itself
on
its
own
merits
with
the
offnotes
i
tasted
maybe
i
just
sampled
from
a
bad
batch
also
when
this
keg
was
added
two
others
grain
belt
premium
and
jacks
pumpkin
spice
ale
had
just
been
switchedout
did
they
forget
to
clean
the
lines
after
swapping
kegs
at
any
rate
i
remain
hopeful
that
this
really
is
a
tasty
brew
that
helps
to
serve
and
satisfy
the
organic
market
i
really
hoped
to
like
it
and
i
gave
it
a
chance
too
pricey
and
really
not
to
my
liking
poured
out
a
golden
honey
color
a
bubbly
off
white
head
slipped
into
a
thin
white
film
rather
quickly
the
nose
offers
some
good
hop
character
honey
with
slightly
fruity
esters
the
taste
comes
at
you
with
hops
and
bitterness
then
turns
slightly
malty
and
fruity
overall
the
hops
dominate
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
like
astringency
around
the
edge
sharp
prickly
carbonation
in
the
mouth
over
all
a
fairly
quaffable
hoppy
beer
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
stone
mill
pale
ale
is
brewed
using
usda
certified
100
percent
organic
barley
malt
supplied
by
small
family
owned
farms
that
specialize
in
organic
foods
its
raw
natural
taste
makes
it
a
good
choice
to
drink
with
cheese
and
crackers
cold
meat
sandwiches
and
other
uncooked
non
processed
foods
it
isnt
too
bad
for
organic
beer
and
it
tasted
better
than
i
initially
expected
a
little
more
body
would
make
it
a
better
brew
all
around
but
it
still
isnt
bad
and
i
would
accept
one
if
it
was
offered
to
me
it
does
have
a
certain
intrigue
but
it
is
a
little
too
soft
for
pale
ale
bottom
line
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
but
one
ill
probably
not
revisit
stone
mill
organic
pale
ale
has
a
forgettable
name
and
a
forgettable
label
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
the
flavor
is
forgettable
as
well
so
what
was
it
that
prompted
me
to
buy
it
i
forget
unless
youre
curious
about
the
brewer
and
the
brewer
behind
the
brewer
id
suggest
that
you
forget
it
too
say
what
you
will
about
ab
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
for
a
costconscious
buyer
its
cheaper
than
sierra
nevada
and
its
made
with
organic
malt
i
plan
to
make
this
a
regular
purchase
middle
of
road
overall
impression
not
bad
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
nice
to
see
ab
offering
some
organic
beers
but
why
not
be
a
bit
more
honest
in
marketing
note
anheuserbuschs
name
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
sixpack
holder
its
certainly
hidden
but
its
there
taste
good
hoppiness
for
the
style
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
with
caramel
a
little
metallic
twang
for
the
style
it
is
pretty
good
not
offensive
andvery
drinkable
one
of
the
better
ab
disguised
beers
i
have
tried
id
seen
this
beer
around
a
few
time
and
noticed
that
it
was
organic
however
i
missed
the
fact
that
this
was
an
anheiser
busch
product
in
any
case
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
large
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
oblivion
lacing
nope
head
retention
nada
theres
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
aroma
as
well
as
some
fruitiness
as
the
beer
comes
to
room
temperature
actually
the
aroma
reminds
me
more
of
a
lager
than
anything
delicate
malt
flavors
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
as
some
graininess
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
very
clean
almost
too
clean
if
i
didnt
read
pale
ale
on
the
label
id
guess
that
this
was
a
lager
someone
else
mentioned
vienna
lager
and
i
tend
to
agree
mouthfeel
is
very
light
much
lighter
than
im
used
to
for
both
american
and
english
pale
ales
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
probably
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
overall
not
bad
but
not
at
all
what
id
expect
for
a
pale
ale
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
lightest
offerings
at
most
brewpubs
the
pale
beer
for
people
who
dont
typically
like
the
more
expiramental
stuff
overall
worth
a
try
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
pale
ales
much
less
beers
out
there
ill
give
props
to
busch
for
trying
out
the
craft
brew
market
its
definitely
better
that
their
massed
produced
brethren
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
another
sixer
of
this
if
my
only
other
choices
are
bud
coors
and
busch
my
guess
is
the
thin
flavor
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
quality
of
organic
barley
available
perhaps
with
more
brewers
going
organic
this
will
change
and
brewers
will
have
more
options
i
want
green
valley
to
keep
at
it
and
develop
an
awesome
version
of
pale
ale
to
keep
stone
mill
alive
taste
is
very
thin
and
dirty
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
spells
alcohol
they
need
to
work
on
these
beers
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
clear
medium
amber
color
aroma
is
mostly
old
hops
co2
and
stale
malt
flavor
is
malt
dominant
with
hop
bitterness
to
balance
however
it
deteriorates
in
the
finish
with
metallic
and
astringent
overtones
the
metallic
taste
just
builds
up
to
intolerable
levels
not
too
drinkable
simply
because
i
cannot
get
over
that
lingering
aftertaste
d
because
of
how
water
like
this
beer
tasted
you
could
physically
drink
a
quite
a
few
but
i
would
not
reccomend
it
poors
a
light
copper
no
head
no
lace
at
all
smell
is
mildly
hops
slight
citrus
to
it
taste
is
relatively
ok
not
alot
jumping
out
at
me
but
still
nice
pretty
well
carbonated
and
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
very
drinkable
for
like
a
party
or
something
but
wouldnt
really
sit
down
to
enjoy
this
i
was
all
excited
to
try
some
organic
beer
but
my
excitement
faded
like
the
head
on
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
light
to
watery
would
make
a
passable
vienna
lager
or
english
bitter
but
otherwise
quite
plain
for
a
beer
and
quite
weak
for
a
pale
ale
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
this
brew
is
a
clear
and
deep
bronze
color
with
a
very
slim
and
quickly
fading
head
the
aroma
is
faint
with
a
sweet
bready
character
theres
a
little
malt
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
a
fruityale
quality
its
a
well
balanced
beer
with
a
substantial
malt
presence
up
front
and
a
crisp
bitterness
in
the
finish
toasted
malts
and
earthiness
are
central
to
the
flavor
medium
body
and
relatively
low
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
certainly
an
eastcoast
pale
ale
id
certainly
have
it
again
first
time
i
saw
this
one
on
tap
never
heard
of
it
before
so
why
not
definitely
a
balanced
pale
ale
with
a
nice
amount
of
hoppiness
that
does
not
cry
out
over
the
top
very
easy
to
drink
did
not
ralize
this
was
organic
but
nonetheless
it
would
be
a
good
choice
if
its
on
special
somewhere
but
will
not
be
one
of
my
faves
stone
mill
organic
pale
ale
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
not
exactly
sure
what
makes
it
usda
approved
to
be
organic
but
all
that
aside
its
a
really
good
beer
this
was
an
interesting
beer
im
not
sure
how
the
organicness
influences
flavor
i
know
ive
read
that
some
brewers
say
organic
malts
are
not
as
good
quality
as
conventional
or
nonorganic
malt
still
this
beer
tastes
good
and
i
dont
think
its
shortcomings
come
from
being
organic
the
aroma
is
nice
there
is
some
cinnamon
and
tealike
notes
from
it
and
some
maltiness
too
very
clean
otherwise
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
distinguished
though
it
has
a
nice
maltiness
and
some
hints
of
complexity
like
a
little
bubble
gum
very
slight
some
spiciness
like
cherries
and
cinnamon
again
and
nice
bitterness
it
does
seem
a
little
outofbalance
though
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
bitterness
level
almost
invoking
cough
syrup
although
not
as
bad
as
some
badly
done
ipas
there
is
also
a
slight
astringency
this
isnt
bad
though
and
id
drink
it
again
this
beer
poured
copper
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
basically
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
pretty
basic
slightly
more
taste
than
a
macro
but
not
much
the
feel
was
dry
it
wasnt
unpleasant
but
the
sample
i
had
will
not
get
me
to
buy
any
appearance
is
bright
suspiciously
bright
red
head
formation
is
pretty
good
sticks
around
decently
aroma
is
very
sweet
made
the
room
i
was
sitting
in
smell
like
sweetbread
was
baking
in
the
corner
taste
is
not
all
that
good
awfully
boring
for
an
ipa
even
if
it
was
meant
to
be
an
english
style
ipa
not
sure
that
it
was
i
feel
like
this
beer
promises
with
the
green
valley
name
labeling
artwork
and
name
something
that
it
just
doesnt
deliver
doesnt
feel
any
more
crafty
than
something
michelob
might
offer
d
if
not
for
the
metallic
twang
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
not
sure
whats
causing
that
flavor
but
i
hope
they
get
it
fixed
i
didnt
want
to
like
this
beer
but
its
really
not
bad
aside
from
the
metallic
taste
notes
i
would
defnintely
buy
this
again
the
fact
that
its
certified
organic
doesnt
do
a
thing
for
me
except
tell
me
to
look
for
it
at
whole
foods
this
is
an
above
average
english
pale
ale
and
priced
right
as
its
under
the
anheiser
busch
umbrella
note
this
is
an
english
style
pale
ale
and
it
should
be
enjoyed
in
the
4555ºf
temperature
range
that
said
typical

clear
orangecopper
body
beneath
an

head
average

and
minor
lacing
nose
is
somewhat
metallic
and
fruity
with
a
subtle
edge
of
buttery
diacetyl
reminiscent
of
a
batemans
xxx
in
a
way
or
at
least
some
other
english
yeast
strain
hops
are
mild
floral
and
grassy
fuggles
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
fine
moderate
carbonation
as
appropriate
for
the
style
the
flavor
offers
a
nice
softly
caramelish
and
biscuity
malt
base
for
the
fruitymetallicbuttery
yeast
character
and
grassy
leafy
and
floral
hops
to
play
on
its
balanced
in
the
composition
of
its
flavors
and
perfectly
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
thats
omnipresent
but
never
oversteps
its
bounds
quite
an
eyeopener
i
havent
enjoyed
a
pint
of
english
pale
ale
this
good
in
years
and
it
really
takes
me
back
in
time
oddly
i
cant
place
the
beer
that
im
thinking
it
reminds
me
of
is
it
john
courage
whatneys
red
barrel
im
thinking
now
that
the
batemans
is
much
more
bloody
regardless
its
really
nice
perfectly
brewed
and
has
the
bonus
of
being
organic
in
fact
if
theres
anything
that
i
could
find
wrong
here
it
might
be
that
its
just
a
little
too
clean
and
perfect
i
could
easily
make
this
a
session
ale
for
a
night
of
darts
out
with
the
lads
kudos
i
got
this
at
my
local
bowling
establishment
on
league
night
colonial
lanes
in
iowa
city
ia
along
with
the
wild
hop
lager
the
waitress
warned
me
on
this
one
and
instead
recommended
the
other
which
gave
me
hope
in
that
this
was
a
real
pale
ale
done
by
ab
and
not
something
akin
to
a
slightly
darker
bud
light
well
i
was
mostly
pleased
the
average
scores
are
due
to
the
fact
that
it
just
doesnt
compare
to
other
better
pale
ales
its
hoppy
enough
to
satisfy
most
connisseurs
of
the
style
but
for
an
organic
beer
it
sure
had
a
syrupy
taste
to
it
i
cant
guarantee
100
that
it
wasnt
the
serving
glass
though
in
short
id
still
rather
have
a
sam
adams
or
even
a
shiner
bock
if
the
craft
brew
cupboard
is
bare
at
the
establishment
i
happen
to
be
visiting
but
for
one
who
really
wants
a
pale
ale
and
nothing
else
will
do
this
should
be
a
tolerable
substitute
for
your
favorite
when
you
want
to
go
out
on
the
town
with
your
buddies
on
a
saturday
night
i
must
say
i
am
very
happy
to
see
that
the
strength
of
the
microbrew
industry
is
causing
huge
macros
like
ab
to
come
out
with
beers
like
this
i
just
hope
future
entries
are
a
bit
better
than
this
a
soso
pale
alethe
metalic
flavors
and
the
unimpressive
head
detracts
from
an
otherwise
safe
brew
pours
out
amber
with
a
slight
head
stoked
to
see
more
organic
beer
on
the
market
even
if
it
is
ab
this
is
a
very
mild
pale
ale
not
much
to
it
balance
is
a
bit
off
to
the
sweet
side
with
not
enough
bitter
to
cover
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
whats
the
point
with
a
good
organic
pale
from
wolavers
brewed
a
few
towns
over
from
me
im
going
to
show
my
beersnobbery
by
saying
im
surprised
this
is
an
ab
affiliated
brewery
a
very
nice
pale
ale
leaning
toward
the
english
style
with
a
bit
more
hops
punch
than
average
very
sturdy
malt
a
touch
heavy
on
the
tongue
hops
arent
crisp
but
they
are
lively
overall
a
good
shot
at
the
style
nothing
that
will
challenge
the
craft
world
but
on
or
near
par
with
the
other
macro
craft
offerings
many
thanks
to
hardtarget
for
this
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
of
large
bubbles
aroma
is
light
on
the
sweet
caramel
candy
side
with
a
hint
of
pineapple
some
notes
of
floral
hops
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
aroma
medium
body
with
a
healthy
dose
of
crystal
malt
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
average
easy
to
drink
beer
fits
right
in
with
other
mild
english
pale
ales
this
beer
poured
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
retentive
head
that
had
some
lacing
the
smell
is
hoppy
as
youd
expect
from
a
pale
ale
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
a
heavy
hop
presence
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy
this
is
a
somewhat
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
for
a
pale
ale
an
ok
beer
but
one
is
enough
da
worth
a
shot
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
not
a
bad
pale
ale
just
not
a
great
one
it
is
very
mild
with
low
hop
levels
it
seems
that
ab
is
trying
to
expand
further
into
the
microcraft
brew
market
but
theyre
going
to
need
to
step
it
up
a
little
more
this
beer
is
just
more
tha
a
little
light
across
the
board
low
on
body
taste
and
aroma
not
the
worst
attempt
at
a
pale
ale
but
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
macro
it
seems
they
tried
to
gear
it
toward
the
macro
drinker
who
might
want
to
try
something
besides
a
light
lager
kind
of
an
odd
take
on
a
pale
ale
not
horrible
but
nothing
i
would
drink
again
a
lackluster
wellbalanced
attempt
at
a
pale
from
ab
i
have
no
bias
for
organic
beer
just
appreciate
good
beer
well
made
well
balanced
whether
or
not
its
organic
so
for
pales
nice
stab
good
cereal
malt
notes
nice
hop
aroma
and
flavor
nothing
crazy
here
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissapears
aroma
is
a
slight
amount
of
malt
behind
a
pleasant
citrus
aroma
taste
is
pretty
thin
but
there
is
a
good
amount
of
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
while
this
is
a
little
more
bland
than
i
would
have
liked
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
that
is
pretty
drinkable
and
would
make
a
good
session
certainly
not
a
terrible
english
pale
but
not
worth
searching
out
although
a
decent
option
for
those
trying
to
stay
natural
the
ingredients
are
basic
and
thats
what
it
is
a
mild
basic
pale
ale
makes
for
a
fine
session
brew
pretty
safe
stuff
solid
and
simple
in
the
medium
malt
profile
and
plenty
of
hop
character
that
allows
bittering
and
earthiness
to
precedent
a
clear
copper
hue
with
a
moderate
head
retention
that
fades
quickly
increased
carbonation
that
becomes
prickly
and
efforvescent
medium
body
with
a
light
metalic
note
and
a
bitter
bite
towards
the
finish
has
a
mild
caramelly
sweetness
and
a
grassy
finish
cant
really
go
wrong
but
little
to
differentiate
this
from
many
other
decent
pale
ales
decent
pale
ale
but
not
exceptional
stone
mill
organic
pale
ale
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
had
good
retention
leaving
some
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
was
fairly
light
mainly
cirus
hops
the
taste
was
citrus
as
well
with
a
little
malt
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
body
was
light
to
medium
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
a
decent
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
about
it
wants
me
to
get
it
again
id
choose
many
other
apas
over
this
one
this
is
actually
an
anheuser
product
although
they
dont
want
to
admit
it
i
thought
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
for
a
usda
certified
organic
brew
the
taste
was
fairly
flavorful
for
a
pale
and
nothing
like
a
typical
bud
product
it
was
refreshing
and
i
didnt
mind
sipping
on
it
ive
found
i
do
like
organic
beers
such
as
butte
creek
porter
drinkability
is
not
good
sadly
as
many
decent
pale
ales
as
there
are
was
expecting
better
not
a
good
choice
for
ab
and
not
to
knock
them
as
they
can
make
drinkable
beers
if
they
try
aka
beach
bum
and
their
winter
bourbon
cask
ale
both
decent
and
drinkable
clear
lighter
copper
appearance
big
pillowy
head
on
a
hard
pour
pretty
decent
duration
but
with
large
bubbles
spare
spotty
laces
aroma
of
brown
sugar
some
definite
orangey
citrus
even
some
rind
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
has
some
heft
to
it
carbonation
level
is
about
medium
flavor
follows
the
aroma
a
slight
malt
sense
but
not
very
distinctive
on
the
tongue
but
a
definite
hoppy
presence
with
a
sharp
twang
to
it
the
close
is
best
nicely
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
not
a
standout
but
meets
the
pale
ale
style
perfectly
well
the
price
point
is
a
bit
high
making
it
a
beer
that
wouldnt
be
my
choice
as
many
more
local
types
are
better
and
cost
less
pretty
drinkable
an
okay
eapa
dont
let
the
fact
its
made
by
the
evil
empire
ab
sway
you
be
objective
brothers
sisters
ab
or
not
this
is
a
solid
english
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
much
less
instead
what
i
got
was
tasty
with
a
lot
of
flavor
profile
its
almost
spot
on
for
the
style
way
to
go
ab
your
best
product
yet
i
love
to
try
things
that
are
organic
whenever
i
can
but
find
that
most
of
the
time
they
are
priced
way
higher
than
their
nonorganic
counterparts
but
offer
a
good
amount
more
for
the
money
i
figured
with
this
beer
what
the
heck
might
as
well
give
it
a
shot
for
6
99
which
is
what
i
would
have
spent
for
sam
adams
or
red
hook
esb
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
and
floral
with
some
sweet
malt
and
just
the
right
of
hops
for
an
english
pa
the
smell
is
fantastic
i
wish
i
had
an
air
freshener
that
smelled
like
this
some
people
say
that
at
1
more
than
most
ab
products
this
is
a
ripoff
but
what
other
ab
product
would
one
compare
this
to
im
glad
that
ab
decided
not
to
put
their
name
on
this
product
as
it
would
probably
stop
some
people
from
buying
it
and
i
have
to
give
props
to
them
for
their
foray
into
actually
decent
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingers
thru
most
of
the
galss
and
leaves
good
lacing
unfortunately
this
was
the
high
point
of
this
beer
never
could
get
much
of
the
fruity
floral
hops
i
would
expect
from
a
pale
ale
and
taste
was
unexciting
as
well
this
was
topped
off
by
a
very
dry
finish
ive
had
better
organic
beers
overall
a
nicely
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
apa
probably
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
but
a
solid
option
nevertheless
overall
impression
not
bad
not
great
the
earthy
bitter
and
candy
sweet
combination
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
this
might
benefit
from
some
mild
aging
to
let
flavors
meld
a
bit
better
i
found
myself
swirling
the
glass
a
bit
to
bleed
off
some
of
the
carbonation
i
guess
this
is
drinkable
if
the
choices
are
slim
but
nothing
exciting
as
the
organic
label
may
lead
one
to
believe
6
88
6pack
has
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
after
a
few
sips
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
metallic
qq
drinkability
is
fair
i
expect
it
would
sit
on
your
stomach
somewhat
heavily
probly
worth
a
try
probly
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
its
a
nice
offering
and
very
drinkable
and
as
i
prefer
ales
to
lagers
this
one
scores
a
little
higher
for
me
this
one
was
better
overall
qualitywise
than
the
wild
hop
lager
but
i
enjoyed
the
wild
hop
a
bit
more
primarily
because
english
pale
ales
arent
really
my
thing
within
the
style
this
one
is
fairly
decent
but
nothing
to
rave
about
much
like
the
wild
hop
its
a
very
basic
crossover
brew
and
really
nothing
more
at
the
very
least
its
an
interesting
if
underwhelming
offering
from
anheuserbusch
this
beer
pours
a
honey
color
with
a
small
head
that
disapates
very
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
hits
you
right
away
with
a
strong
bisquity
aroma
but
very
soon
the
smell
seems
to
disappear
completely
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
a
slight
hop
presence
and
floral
flavors
the
mf
is
light
and
creamy
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
not
a
bad
beer
yet
lacking
in
some
big
areas
anheuserbuschs
launch
into
the
market
is
an
interesting
one
while
the
beer
is
certainly
nothing
to
rave
about
its
pedestrian
enough
both
in
flavor
and
marketing
to
cross
the
street
and
appeal
to
both
the
gottagetmyhandsonanythingorganic
beer
drinker
and
the
masses
this
is
a
very
safe
entry
into
the
organic
market
for
ab
and
nonetheless
still
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
an
organic
pale
ale
d
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
a
good
no
brainer
beer
to
keep
the
palate
in
check
and
to
switch
things
up
i
would
not
mind
having
this
one
in
the
fridge
here
and
there
this
beer
is
crisp
refreshing
and
has
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
in
it
o
drainpour
a
nice
balanced
pale
ale
that
hits
the
spot
overall
good
beer
and
tasty
definitely
worthy
of
the
medals
it
has
won
at
both
the
world
beer
cup
gold
in
2000
and
the
great
american
beer
festival
gold
in
1999
and
bronze
in
2006
ill
certainly
get
it
again
i
know
its
described
as
englishstyle
on
the
label
but
its
still
surprisingly
malt
forward
for
a
pale
ale
not
as
balanced
or
to
my
taste
as
more
hopforward
pale
ales
overall
this
is
a
fairly
solid
offering
while
certainly
not
the
best
pale
ive
ever
had
its
certainly
makes
a
great
session
beer
and
provides
a
nice
alternative
to
most
other
pales
i
should
add
that
it
also
goes
well
with
most
food
overall
a
really
nice
english
style
beer
that
is
thick
and
hearty
low
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
copper
on
the
pour
with
a
one
finger
head
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bland
smell
of
malt
and
outs
taste
was
slight
hops
on
the
front
and
slight
malt
on
the
back
but
nothing
special
good
but
was
hoping
for
more
from
great
divide
beer
1
on
a
great
divide
sampler
night
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
less
malty
than
the
smell
hops
are
up
front
but
not
overpowering
some
malts
are
present
as
well
as
a
bit
of
lemon
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
but
one
is
enough
for
tonight
dpa
is
one
of
great
divides
best
sellers
and
its
easy
to
understand
why
smooth
very
drinkable
and
not
too
high
alcohol
youll
reach
for
this
one
a
lot
nothing
wrong
with
a
basic
pale
ale
and
this
one
delivers
the
taste
is
also
full
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
roasted
sweetness
with
just
a
hint
of
pear
maybe
and
a
low
bitterness
to
finish
things
of
it
is
a
nicely
done
pale
for
certain
o
definitely
more
in
the
vein
of
the
english
pale
because
of
the
dominating
malt
presence
which
is
fine
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
that
a
great
bitter
beer
without
being
over
the
top
bitter
the
hops
almost
feel
as
if
they
jump
around
while
youre
drinking
theres
a
slightly
sweet
start
with
that
aforementioned
bitter
finish
that
i
personally
look
forward
to
when
i
go
for
another
swig
not
sure
how
it
is
in
the
bottle
but
id
definitely
have
this
beer
again
overall
a
nice
pale
that
should
appease
pale
fans
the
denver
pale
ale
is
ok
while
i
am
writing
this
i
am
still
drinking
it
hoping
it
will
grow
on
me
a
bit
more
the
beer
poured
a
nice
amber
clear
color
with
thin
foamy
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
has
some
fresh
hop
to
it
but
very
faint
the
taste
a
decent
balanced
beer
with
slightly
bitter
hops
paired
well
with
caramel
type
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
good
but
not
outstanding
o
a
for
at
least
trying
to
brew
an
english
pale
but
the
brew
is
a
d
at
best
if
somebody
put
a
macrobrew
label
on
this
i
might
buy
it
there
is
no
malt
taste
at
all
and
what
hops
there
are
taste
more
like
rubbing
alcohol
than
fuggles
too
bad
i
had
high
hopes
but
this
is
definitely
a
oneoff
for
me
this
beer
is
a
great
pale
ale
totally
satisfying
and
with
the
noncrazy
abv
you
can
have
a
few
however
with
all
the
malt
not
sure
if
id
want
more
than
a
couple
id
get
this
again
though
certainly
welcome
it
in
the
mixed
pack
o
a
decent
ale
and
not
a
style
im
familiar
with
but
a
worthy
try
muted
bitterness
and
easy
drinking
seems
like
it
would
be
best
enjoyed
in
6
seconds
or
less
oenjoyed
this
beer
it
had
many
things
going
on
and
balanced
out
great
o
easy
drinking
which
is
what
you
want
out
of
an
english
pale
ale
well
balanced
neither
hops
nor
malt
really
take
center
stage
happy
to
have
tried
but
i
dont
need
to
come
back
to
this
a
pretty
slavish
ode
to
the
headier
of
the
english
pale
ales
out
here
even
delving
slightly
into
esb
territory
denver
can
be
proud
to
call
this
their
own
session
ale
even
if
the
style
and
abv
hardly
qualify
it
as
such
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
havent
tasted
anything
quite
like
this
but
now
that
i
have
ill
be
back
for
more
great
with
giant
nj
sea
scallops
and
yellow
heirloom
tomates
with
lightly
sauteed
cukes
beet
leaves
chard
and
pasta
and
rosemary
bread
great
food
beer
a
welldone
apa
with
excellent
distinctive
flavors
and
aromas
to
please
your
palate
its
not
a
powerhouse
hop
bomb
nor
an
overly
bold
malt
monster
just
a
wellbalanced
yet
easy
drinking
ale
tasty
and
classy
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
the
english
pale
ale
style
good
bready
biscuit
taste
with
some
nice
earthy
backing
hops
o
an
average
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
more
but
whatever
not
terrible
just
not
great
overall
this
is
another
great
great
divide
brew
lets
hope
our
colorado
brethren
dont
start
clamoring
for
a
new
style
the
dpa
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
earthy
and
spicy
greens
light
leek
cilantro
mustard
seed
and
peat
moss
didnt
see
that
coming
like
a
surprise
roundhouse
from
jcvd
the
taste
is
mostly
a
blast
of
spicy
and
salty
greens
think
a
salad
of
cilantro
chive
parsley
and
spinach
all
drizzled
with
a
chlorinated
peppercorn
dressing
though
there
is
a
backbone
of
mild
biscuit
trying
desperately
to
bring
things
back
to
reality
no
avail
im
afraid
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
this
is
a
strange
and
downright
unpleasant
or
if
im
not
being
so
euphemisticallyinclined
nasty
beer
its
touted
as
a
balanced
and
mild
englishstyle
pale
ale
but
it
comes
across
as
an
oddly
spicy
and
salty
mess
i
thought
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
upon
talking
with
others
who
have
had
it
from
the
source
on
tap
in
the
rockies
its
clear
this
stuff
is
just
plain
awful
had
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
smell
was
understated
with
hints
of
malt
toffee
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
was
less
hoppy
as
you
might
expect
from
a
english
style
pale
ale
and
there
were
nice
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
the
carbonation
was
maybe
a
bit
more
than
id
like
but
not
too
bad
the
appearance
is
sort
of
a
goldishcopper
and
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
overall
pretty
decent
o
this
was
a
nice
change
for
a
pale
ale
it
has
a
good
malty
flavor
and
the
oil
from
the
hops
give
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
could
have
hit
more
flavor
points
pours
crystal
clear
with
a
finger
of
egg
white
head
nice
caramel
orangish
hue
faint
to
no
hops
in
the
nose
but
hints
of
straw
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
i
really
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
upper
end
of
medium
body
slight
earthy
hops
present
in
the
taste
with
nice
caramel
and
toasty
malt
character
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
is
well
made
my
enjoyment
was
after
a
particularly
stressful
day
and
it
went
down
well
in
the
adirondack
chair
on
the
front
lawn
oi
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
i
tend
to
like
more
sharpness
in
my
pale
ales
and
this
brew
was
definitely
on
the
butter
side
and
malt
heavy
which
is
odd
given
the
lack
of
head
and
oily
lacing
on
the
glass
nevertheless
i
guess
this
is
an
english
pale
so
it
cant
be
faulted
too
much
for
being
overly
malty
appearance
is
pale
and
clear
with
minimal
head
smell
is
mild
and
grainy
almost
no
hops
to
speak
of
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
and
addition
of
a
little
earthy
hop
presence
along
with
some
caramel
mouthfeel
is
lackin
in
carbonation
and
is
very
light
pretty
boring
beer
overall
overall
my
bottle
is
from
august
2012
which
isnt
helping
im
sure
its
got
a
little
too
much
of
a
herbalwet
grass
type
flavour
going
on
for
me
it
reminds
me
of
a
falloktoberfest
type
beer
oa
very
complex
brew
i
feel
like
i
havent
picked
up
on
all
the
flavors
as
i
have
only
drank
one
a
damn
good
pale
ale
though
what
a
good
beer
this
is
a
decent
take
on
the
british
style
it
doesnt
have
a
very
complex
flavor
profile
but
the
drinkability
is
there
i
could
definitely
work
on
a
sixpack
of
this
while
watching
the
game
on
tap
at
great
divide
apparently
have
never
had
this
golden
color
lots
of
grainy
malt
light
bitterness
no
hop
flavor
an
interesting
light
drinkable
ale
just
on
the
high
end
of
being
sessionable
but
probably
could
be
ive
never
had
a
beer
that
tastes
quite
like
this
one
so
it
gets
points
for
uniqueness
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
but
i
think
i
like
it
yes
i
think
i
would
like
to
have
this
again
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
pale
ale
i
would
order
it
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
oat
the
end
of
the
day
a
boring
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
balanced
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
having
this
compared
to
american
pale
ales
this
is
a
pleasant
ale
to
knock
back
during
dinnertime
denver
pale
ale
features
an
amber
orangish
color
with
an
attractive
creamy
head
which
retains
well
the
nose
hints
that
this
pale
ale
is
going
across
the
atlantic
for
its
inspiriation
lead
by
notes
of
orange
cream
and
buttery
fusels
the
taste
starts
off
crisp
and
netural
eventually
breaking
towards
a
buttersctoch
note
a
modest
kick
of
hops
make
their
mark
in
the
2nd
half
of
each
sip
offering
both
a
crisp
and
somewhat
creamy
texture
this
pale
ale
is
a
more
than
fair
choice
overall
decent
though
not
quite
english
in
style
missing
some
of
the
toffee
and
butterscotch
flavors
youd
expect
from
an
english
style
pale
ale
there
was
also
a
bit
too
much
grassy
flavor
for
my
liking
nevertheless
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
that
some
people
will
really
enjoy
give
it
a
chance
if
you
see
it
thanks
again
doops
overall
this
was
nice
would
buy
again

i
originally
drank
this
thinking
it
was
an
apa
rather
than
an
epa
and
was
disappointed
there
wasnt
more
hop
bite
but
given
the
style
thats
ok
solid
brew
and
very
drinkable
i
was
not
fond
of
this
creation
it
had
a
confused
set
of
flavors
and
aromas
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
a
medium
body
that
leans
on
the
heavy
side
and
a
sweet
grainy
finish
that
has
bready
notes
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
a
very
tasty
pale
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
well
above
average
for
this
style
not
something
ill
have
again
no
character
in
this
beer
easy
to
drink
as
a
macro
but
its
not
a
macro
so
it
does
little
for
me
o
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
not
the
easiest
to
drink
there
is
something
a
little
different
about
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
especially
for
the
style
that
was
not
really
to
my
preference
o
a
unique
pale
ale
that
has
a
lot
of
exclusive
characteristics
not
quite
for
me
although
it
makes
me
realize
that
aside
from
the
formidable
yeti
not
many
of
great
divides
brews
are
to
my
liking
pours
clear
orangey
amber
in

that
fades
smells
of
pine

tastes
of

a

drinking
a
solid
ale
for
this
style
i
dont
know
what
it
is
bout
this
beer
but
i
always
love
kicking
this
one
back
it
has
a
distinct
flavor
that
seems
to
stand
out
from
the
rest
othis
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoy
the
bitterness
a
lot
would
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
caramel
body
but
this
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
at
a
pretty
nice
price
overall
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
the
balance
between
hops
and
malts
is
what
i
think
of
in
a
pale
ale
and
great
divide
gets
this
one
right
in
that
aspect
this
pours
an
amber
golden
color
in
the
glass
i
get
a
pleasing
orange
hop
aroma
followed
by
some
toasted
malt
notes
the
flavor
has
an
upfront
bittering
with
a
light
orange
citrus
and
a
pleasing
finish
pretty
average
pale
ale
overall
the
sight
and
smell
were
above
average
but
the
taste
and
feel
was
fairly
average

smells

little

really
snort
for
it

taste
brings
a
lot
of
the
same
plus
a
bit
of
metallic
malty
afterburn
perfectly
drinkable
but
not

exciting

getting
this
one
in

to
the
nose
pale
malt
fresh
hops
and
citrus
on
the
initial
taste
which
rolls
into
a
flattened
medium
sized
body
dry
hoppy
finish
great
drinkability
o
great
session
beer
slightly
hoppier
than
the
ipswitch
i
liked
the
ipswitch
just
a
little
bit
more
but
both
are
very
good
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
34
finger
white
head
some
retention
some
lacing
the
nose
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
caramel
malty
sweetness
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
an
initial
surge
of
earthy
and
citrus
hops
that
gradually
mellow
and
allow
the
caramel
malt
to
emerge
creating
a
balanced
flavor
mild
to
medium
bitterness
and
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
with
a
lingering
hop
flavor
and
mild
sweetness
crisp
and
clean
overall
a
good
pale
ale
not
one
i
would
actively
pursue
but
wouldnt
pass
on
necessarily
pours
amber
with
a
finger
of
whipped
creamy
foam
this
falls
to
a
quilt
of
the
same
some
pine
citrus
and
a
hint
of
body
odor
on
the
nose
nothing
remarkable
taste
is
malty
with
a
dominant
english
and
oxidized
character
medium
body
with
moderate
carb
decent
for
drinking
nothing
to
send
home
about
the
head
formed
quickly
and
went
with
some
moderate
lacing
its
smell
was
its
least
interesting
quality
it
was
bitter
the
taste
was
decent
there
wasnt
the
malt
i
was
expecting
it
reminded
me
of
a
weak
ipa
the
hops
took
this
one
over
all
in
all
it
was
ok
worth
a
try
but
not
a
full
six
pack
the
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
but
neither
is
too
much
not
the
greatest
pale
ale
i
have
had
or
the
best
from
great
divide
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
decent
english
style
pale
ale
pours
a
darker
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
smells
very
english
tons
and
tons
of
malts
like
a
dense
loaf
of
fresh
bread
some
more
hops
in
the
flavor
but
only
in
there
at
the
end
feels
pretty
good
too
in
the
mouth
lots
of
body
here
and
enough
carbonation
easy
drinking
but
not
particularly
thrilling
overall
good
beer
in
the
great
divide
lineup
pours
a
copperamber
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
leaves
the
aroma
is
a
balance
between
the
lemon
zest
and
sweet
but
bready
malt
flavor
wise
is
pretty
much
in
line
with
the
aroma
as
the
first
flavor
that
presents
itself
is
that
of
some
lemon
then
comes
the
bready
but
sweet
malt
middle
and
it
closes
out
with
a
distinct
dose
of
some
hops
a
nice
medium
body
to
this
thing
a
very
solid
ep
that
fans
of
pale
ales
will
surely
like
a
lot
more
than
me
for
me
i
can
drink
it
happily
but
generally
dont
go
out
of
my
way
for
at
first
glance
this
isnt
all
that
different
than
your
standard
apa
its
a
nice
amber
color
but
nothing
overly
glowing
has
a
clean
white
1
finger
head
after
the
pour
but
it
doesnt
stick
around
for
very
long
the
appearance
is
the
only
thing
that
i
find
average
on
this
beer
the
smell
holds
little
back
sweet
earthy
hops
right
up
front
but
the
malts
get
in
there
too
the
same
could
be
said
for
that
first
swig
of
it
more
hops
than
it
would
lead
you
to
believe
right
up
front
but
a
really
nice
malty
backbone
that
a
lot
of
beers
with
this
much
hops
seem
to
leave
out
in
fact
the
balance
on
this
one
is
really
spoton
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
than
your
typical
pale
with
medium
foamy
carbonation
but
this
beer
is
really
very
drinkable
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
really
where
it
excels
overall
this
is
my
favorite
standard
pale
ale
the
5
4
is
hard
to
believe
from
a
beer
that
packs
this
much
hoppiness
but
i
dont
think
theres
much
that
could
get
better
about
it
a
staple
in
my
fridge
o
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
regulars
i
drink
it
when
i
buy
the
variety
pack
still
its
above
average
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
when
i
do
get
it
o
3
sparkly
clear
copper
pour
with
a
light
but
foamy
white
head
and
a
solid
amount
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
very
pleasant
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
caramel
malt
behind
it
light
caramel
backbone
with
the
bitter
english
hop
presence
smooth
and
dry
on
the
palate
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
although
i
liked
it
its
still
slightly
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
pours
a
orangeambertan
color
the
hues
slightly
remind
me
of
the
look
of
a
marzen
the
head
is
about
34
of
an
inch
an
has
pretty
good
retention
carbonation
is
visible
this
is
truly
a
visually
appealing
beer
smell
is
of
toffee
grainy
malts
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
emphasizes
the
malts
but
it
still
doesnt
seem
disproportionally
flavored
to
me
the
taste
starts
with
a
caramel
sweetness
them
gets
a
mottled
more
toasty
a
slight
bitterness
is
imparted
by
the
citric
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
feels
satisfyingly
thick
often
other
pale
ales
feel
a
little
weak
in
this
dept
to
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
it
to
drink
as
an
everyday
sort
of
beer
overall
a
decently
balanced
beer
slightly
heavy
on
the
palate
for
my
preference
i
could
see
this
benefitting
from
higher
attenuation
fewer
crystal
malts
or
both
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
nothing
spectacular
a
lot
of
my
friends
who
are
getting
into
beers
love
this
though
so
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
someone
getting
into
beers
easy
to
drink
with
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
not
super
exciting
overall
but
very
well
made
and
tasty
quite
sessionable
id
think
o
solid
pale
ale
not
sure
if
id
ever
purchase
this
in
a
6pack
considering
great
divide
has
so
many
incredible
beers
but
it
was
a
welcomed
addition
in
the
variety
pack
d
another
solid
offering
from
gd
its
idealy
built
and
well
balanced
drinkability
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
you
will
love
this
effort
this
is
a
terrific
drinker
wellbalaned
yet
bold
with
an
incredibly
smooth
character
its
so
easy
to
drink
and
matches
up
so
nicely
with
the
best
of
the
best
beers
out
there
great
divide
is
such
a
top
notch
brewery
even
their
pale
ale
is
a
winner
good
beer
from
colorado
this
is
an
interesting
brew
curious
as
to
how
they
got
the
feel
of
it
without
amping
up
the
body
nothing
that
really
knocks
my
socks
off
here
just
a
solid
pale
ale
nicely
drinkable
but
nothing
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
overall
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
goose
island
honkers
ale
it
is
an
easy
drinking
slightly
bitter
beer
that
is
widely
available
overall
solid
pale
ale
a
touch
on
the
breadybiscuity
side
but
a
flavor
profile
that
works
well
with
the
bitterness
to
complement
o
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
love
this
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
two
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
great
lacing
down
the
sides
nice
grapefruit
hop
flavors
the
hops
are
not
very
biting
and
round
out
nicely
considering
the
beer
its
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
hop
heads
id
buy
this
beer
again
sometime
overall
a
nice
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
in
the
taste
a
little
off
in
the
aroma
a
very
good
beer
overall
impression
tough
to
say
but
this
was
not
a
good
english
pale
ale
from
great
divide
way
to
sweet
and
malty
needed
to
have
more
hops
in
here
im
still
wondering
why
there
wasnt
a
bottled
on
date
on
this
one
but
all
the
rest
this
may
be
just
a
bad
brew
will
try
again
to
see
great
divide
denver
pale
ale
the
label
reads
english
style
ale
and
that
what
you
get
pour
this
beer
and
you
get
and
english
oak
panel
brown
color

topped
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
by
the
time
most
of
the
brew
is
gone
very
good
aroma
nice
complexity
with
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
coming
through
flavors
come
on
slowly
but
end
with
the
unmistakable
roasted
malt
that
is
typical
of
an
english
style
ale
there
is
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
lots
of
malt
sweetness
this
great
divide
ale
goes
down
smoothly
for
a
beer
with
a
thick
feel
to
it
english
style
ales
are
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
this
is
a
good
one
if
you
are
so
inclined
and
a
good
beer
overall
ov
one
of
the
true
great
american
pales
that
isnt
just
a
masquerading
ipa
excellent
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
and
easy
drinking
beer
it
showed
off
the
malty
toasty
somewhat
sweet
flavors
nicely
while
still
managing
to
be
balanced

drinkable

a
good
pale

ok
i
guess
the
apple
ciderapplesauce
character
which
at
times
makes
me
think
of
gerber
baby
food
really
picks
up
steam
as
it
warms
which
isnt
my
favorite
flavor
profile
in
a
beer
and
detracts
from
my
enjoyment
definitely
worth
a
try

a
solid
and
sessionworthy
pale

pretty
tasty
beer
id
happily
drink
this
one
again
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
it
because
im
ready
for
another
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
am
enjoying
it
for
sure
just
very
simple
and
there
are
better
pales
american
or
english
out
there
good
job
great
divide
another
amazingly
balanced
drinkable
delicious
beer
definatly
recomend
to
anybody
there
isnt
a
bad
note
in
this
one
found
at
the
back
of
the
beer
fridge
at
a
friends
house
a
good
pale
ale
with
a
healthy
kick
and
awesome
mouthfeel
that
made
it
stand
out
from
your
usual
domestic
pale
ale
entries
it
didnt
taste
like
it
was
old
or
skunky
which
made
me
wonder
why
it
had
been
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
fridge
glad
i
found
it
dont
let
me
mislead
you
while
the
hops
to
me
are
more
prevalent
than
the
light
malt
this
is
not
a
hoppy
beer
its
just
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
it
seems
like
itd
be
a
great
session
beer
or
even
a
great
fallback
beer
in
a
moment
of
indecision
its
a
classic
in
the
pale
ale
style
well
done
in
that
regard
this
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
light
a
little
bread
malts
a
hint
of
grass
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
better
than
expected
from
the
smell
i
get
some
bread
malts
up
front
a
ittle
caramel
toffee
sweetness
and
a
nice
hoppy
bitter
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
taste
yup
same
as
the
smell
which
is
to
say
awesome
you
get
the
taste
of
warm
freshly
baked
white
bread
followed
by
some
maltiness
then
a
moderate
hop
bitter
finish
and
its
all
in
perfect
balance
its
amazing
its
refreshing
its
comforting
its
super
satisfying
and
thirst
quenching
cheers
a
very
well
balanced
pale
ale
a
really
good
pale
ale
its
just
a
shame
that
really
good
pale
ales
leave
you
with
little
to
say
this
one
is
a
well
made
exercise
in
restrained
classical
brewing
d
definitely
not
for
the
hop
head
as
this
is
a
very
basic
beer
nice
and
simple
if
you
are
trying
to
get
started
with
pale
ales
and
havent
quite
gotten
the
taste
for
strong
hops
yet
if
youre
a
hop
addict
avoid
this
as
it
will
taste
quite
bland
not
alot
of
frills
but
thats
what
i
expect
with
english
styles
well
its
pleasant
enough
i
wont
write
a
ballad
about
it
but
nicely
carbonated
and
quaffable
overall
it
isnt
bad
its
just
not
good
not
going
to
recommend
it
to
anyone
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
12
inch

that
fades

an
oily
film

spots

lace

a
very
herbal

quickly
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
feel
overall
this
is
alright
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
most
likely
d
3
5
im
glad
i
gave
this
single
a
shot
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
ok
overall
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
it
was
kind
of
bland
if
i
preferred
the
flavor
a
little
more
i
could
drink
plenty
based
on
its
smoothness
alone
and
it
isnt
heavy
either
id
like
to
try
some
other
great
divide
products
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
all
mix
together
really
nice
and
there
is
a
really
solid
hap
malt
balance
here
the
stronger
yeast
character
is
also
very
nice
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
nothing
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
subtle
with
a
slight
hop
hint
and
some
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
there
is
a
slight
caramel
malt
character
along
with
a
little
lemon
and
at
the
end
a
little
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
overall
the
beer
is
solid
the
taste
is
what
shines
through
on
this
one
the
nice
subtle
notes
of
the
style
are
really
present
there
you
could
have
a
couple
of
these
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
with
chili
or
other
spicy
food
just
a
great
complement
it
shines
with
a
meal
but
is
not
as
fantastic
by
itself
in
my
opinion
o
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
offering
its
not
bad
but
not
great
im
such
a
huge
fan
of
great
divides
imperial
stout
dipa
and
barleywine
i
guess
you
cant
be
great
at
everything
this
beer
is
pretty
typical
of
the
style
a
little
better
than
most
ive
had
but
not
as
good
as
some
very
drinkable
and
sessionalble
though
well
balanced
and
sessionable
gdbc
has
gotten
those
aspects
of
the
english
pale
style
down
pat
but
this
beer
barely
makes
it
into
the
pale
range
with
the
hops
only
slightly
bitter
and
lacking
in
flavor
sessionable
for
sure
but
not
enough
integrated
into
this
beer
to
be
memorable
a
stepping
stone
beer
into
the
world
of
pale
ales
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
darker
hued
orange
amber
color
eith
a
fluffy
white
big
bubbled
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
sweet
orange
with
maybe
a
slight
pineapple
flavor
in
the
nose
medium
mouthfeel
not
really
overly
bitter
by
any
means
and
leans
more
on
the
citrus
sweet
side
some
bitterness
lingers
overall
this
is
ok
and
probaby
would
be
better
suited
for
folks
that
are
just
getting
into
pale
with
a
light
hop
quality
no
real
alcohol
notes
fairly
easy
drinking
but
far
from
remarkable
o
quite
enjoyable
kick
back
and
relax
kind
of
beer
well
worth
a
try
this
was
much
liked
by
my
wife
othat
sour
aroma
and
taste
make
this
one
tough
to
get
down
i
have
to
say
i
am
greatly
surprised
by
this
one
normally
gd
beers
can
be
counted
on
for
quality
ill
have
to
buy
this
one
again
and
revisit
it
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
oi
believe
this
is
my
first
english
pale
ale
its
nice
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
apa
more
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
overall
this
may
have
been
the
first
pale
ale
i
ever
had
some
17
years
ago
it
is
like
a
remembered
it
a
well
balanced
sessionable
ale
taste
bitter
not
hoppy
though
a
little
bit
of
caramel
offputting
aftertaste
gritty
yeasty
once
your
palate
gets
adjusted
becomes
easier
to
drink
somewhat
lemony
too
pricy
at
almost
10
a
6
pack
overall
this
is
an
excellent
english
style
pale
ale
i
wonder
if
some
of
its
detractors
on
the
site
are
grading
the
style
more
than
grading
the
beer
to
the
style
interestingly
it
does
not
seem
to
have
suffered
from
being
a
bit
past
its
labeled
prime
but
that
isnt
the
case
and
i
wish
for
more
i
dont
mean
to
be
cruel
here
but
this
beer
just
seems
a
little
too
watery
with
a
hint
of
the
bitterness
and
an
even
fainter
hint
of
the
hoppiness
that
im
lookin
for
overall
probably
the
least
impressive
of
the
great
divide
line
up
would
be
scored
higher
here
if
the
prices
were
lower
still
a
decent
beer
for
grilling
out
or
enjoying
with
snacks
12
ounce
bottle
pours
crystal
clear
light
orange
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
off
white
head
with
very
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
lacing
cap
that
lasts
for
the
entire
glass
some
ok
glass
lacing
aromas
of
citrus
floral
spices
and
caramel
aromas
are
a
bit
weak
but
still
pretty
good
taste
of
caramel
spices
bread
and
some
citrus
there
is
a
fairly
large
amount
of
bitterness
that
comes
at
the
finish
and
it
linger
for
a
while
with
spiciness
and
citrus
flavors
no
alcohol
noticed
at
all
medium
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
the
carbonation
seems
to
detract
some
of
the
flavor
but
is
not
too
bad
some
good
balance
of
the
hops
and
malts
very
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
overall
a
very
solid
pale
ale
d
goes
down
alright
but
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
other
great
divides
are
better
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
has
plenty
of
interest
perfectly
sessionable
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
hue
nice
onefinger
white
head
really
good
lacing
faint
citrus
hop
aroma
not
much
there
taste
starts
off
with
a
refreshing
light
hop
profile
solid
mix
of
grassy
citrus
and
pine
hops
fairly
big
sweet
malt
profile
gives
this
one
a
classic
apa
flavor
profile
hints
of
cherry
sweet
bread
toffee
and
caramel
malt
some
hop
crispness
lingers
on
the
aftertaste
d
ill
drink
it
again
but
not
top
on
the
list
the
denver
pale
ale
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
rich
hoppiness
that
really
gets
me
excited
for
a
sip
the
flavor
is
a
sharp
bite
at
first
followed
by
a
rich
smoothness
a
worthy
beer
if
you
get
a
chance
give
this
one
a
try
not
gds
best
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
it
goes
down
easily
without
being
too
thin
and
its
drinkable
enough
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
otherwise
goes
down
very
nicely
another
middleoftheroad
craft
brew
that
does
nothing
different
to
stand
out
from
the
pack
d
eh
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
was
ok
i
would
drink
it
if
there
were
no
other
craft
brew
options
available
drinkability
very
solid
english
pale
ale
well
balanced
and
drinkable
a
solid
representation
of
a
pale
ale
good
not
great
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
probably
will
not
seek
it
out
in
the
future
pours
a
medium
gold
color
w
a
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
very
floral
nose
to
this
beer
and
not
much
else
theres
a
floral
grassy
hoppy
taste
to
this
beer
maybe
some
vanilla
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
for
me
very
smooth
and
creamy
like
an
ipa
root
beer
float
drinkability
is
somewhere
between
fair
and
good
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
not
great
but
im
thankful
to
have
tried
it
bottled
on
nov
24
2010
poured
from
the
bottle
with
an
explosive
thick
foamy
white
headeven
with
a
gentle
pour
the
head
pillowedcolor
was
a
bright
orange
copper
smell
was
of
tropical
and
piney
hops
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
buscuity
malt
taste
was
hop
dominated
mostly
grapefruit
and
piney
hops
with
a
touch
of
buscuity
malt
mouthfeel
was
alive
very
crisp
and
dry
drinkability
was
nice
would
enjoy
in
the
summer
or
fall
drinkability
has
a
bit
more
bite
than
most
pales
but
it
is
still
pretty
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
goes
great
with
a
cheeseburger
and
fries
solid
beer
from
great
divide
tasty
crisp
and
quite
sessionable
nothing
spectacular
just
solid
the
md
are
dry
at
the
finish
but
but
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
a
great
beer
for
anytime
overall
a
refreshingly
good
beer
nothing
too
exciting
and
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
out
or
feel
i
am
missing
to
not
have
regularly
just
a
solid
pale
ale
much
like
many
others
all
in
all
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
poured
a
clear
copper
amber
with
a
one
fingered
off
white
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
sticky
lacing
the
entire
pint
glass
light
aromas
of
malts
and
citrus
hops
on
the
nose
crisp
piney
hops
and
malt
on
the
palate
with
nice
clean
feel
and
desent
carbonation
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
hazy
gold
pour
with
a
big
sticky
white
head
the
beer
leaves
nice
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
and
floral
it
has
a
floral
hop
taste
up
front
and
a
lighly
bitter
finish
kinda
muddled
in
the
middle
the
body
is
lighter
than
i
would
like
but
not
terrible
a
decent
english
pale
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
again
it
says
english
on
the
label
as
in
english
pale
ale
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thing
english
here
is
the
label
copy
everything
about
this
beer
says
american
pale
ale
theres
isnt
enough
fruity
aroma
or
taste
to
qualify
as
a
good
english
pa
but
it
has
enough
floral
stuff
in
it
to
make
it
compete
with
a
decent
apa
such
as
those
from
bbc
theres
a
edgy
sharp
bite
from
the
hops
and
the
ample
fizz
and
the
dry
finish
would
make
it
a
decent
pounder
although
i
wouldt
recommend
wasting
it
that
way
overall
its
a
nice
average
beer
for
average
circumstances
d
very
drinkable
but
not
impressive
watery
goes
down
easy
bland
the
contradictions
in
this
beer
place
it
very
high
on
the
list
of
mostdrinkable
beers
do
drinkability
is
high
due
to
low
abv
and
the
fact
that
there
isnt
too
much
flavor
to
kill
the
palate
a
six
pack
would
be
no
problem
with
this
beer
consider
me
a
tad
unimpressed
d
taking
into
accounnt
the
complexity
of
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
extremely
high
the
first
night
picked
this
beer
up
i
drank
5
in
a
row
at
a
party
and
felt
great
therefore
i
would
deem
this
beer
a
very
tasty
session
beer
slightly
below
average
pale
that
can
be
skipped
id
try
it
again
on
cask
notes
this
is
a
solid
english
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
american
boldness
and
flare
this
is
good
but
id
throw
it
in
with
the
many
beers
ive
tried
that
taste
almost
the
same
entry
level
pale
ale
along
the
lines
of
great
lakes
or
sierra
nevada
seems
more
like
a
crisp
apa
than
an
english
pale
ale
either
way
damn
good
never
dissapointed
w
great
divide
highly
drinkable
this
is
an
easy
goto
session
beer
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
english
pale
ales
for
sure
all
in
all
its
certainly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
i
would
rank
this
in
the
top
beers
for
style
i
love
epas
and
the
maltiness
and
caramel
usually
found
in
them
so
im
a
little
disappointed
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
slightly
off
white
head
and
sticky
lacing
lots
of
visible
carbonation
smells
like
sweet
citrus
fruit
with
a
nice
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
really
good
balance
on
this
one
taste
of
oats
and
grains
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
finish
and
a
mild
sweetness
this
is
really
great
good
mouth
feel
with
a
medium
body
and
nice
carbonation
at
5
4
this
is
a
great
one
to
enjoy
a
few
of
bottled
on
may
12
2010
drank
on
august
12
2010
thanks
to
my
brother
for
giving
me
this
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
minimal
head
nice
golden
color
to
this
one
smells
like
bready
malt
sweetness
spicy
hops
can
be
detected
as
well
as
far
as
the
smell
goes
everything
is
in
perfect
balance
the
taste
is
immediately
sweet
with
bitterness
hitting
the
sides
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
crisp
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
ale
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
just
wants
a
better
beer
decently
done
beer
from
great
divide
it
tastes
slightly
hoppy
but
the
word
i
would
most
use
to
describe
it
is
light
not
so
much
weak
or
watery
but
light
i
find
it
incredibly
drinkable
very
clean
but
only
slightly
buttery
aftertaste
just
enough
to
invite
another
perfect
for
a
hot
day
in
my
opinion
not
the
most
remarkable
or
complex
but
i
think
it
makes
for
a
fantastic
six
pack
d
quite
a
good
pale
ale
i
thought
i
could
drink
many
of
dpas
and
i
think
it
should
appeal
to
a
wide
range
of
beer
drinkers
recommended
as
an
easydrinking
sessionable
brew
or
one
to
break
out
when
all
your
rowdy
friends
come
calling
deep
yelloworange
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
healthy
white
cap
light
citrusy
lemon
and
malt
aromas
light
bodied
with
a
buttery
smoothness
light
hoppy
lemon
and
grapefruit
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
lead
to
malty
biscuit
flavors
adn
a
noce
dry
finish
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
yet
uninspiring
pale
ale
that
would
make
a
good
refreshing
all
daynight
drinker
d
very
drinkable
this
is
actually
my
first
english
style
pale
ale
and
though
it
probably
wasnt
the
best
choice
for
first
try
it
certainly
got
me
more
interested
in
the
style
d
a
nice
enough
pale
ale
but
so
far
it
seems
the
english
pales
on
this
side
of
the
pond
have
some
work
to
do
fairly
smooth
slightly
warming
with
a
medium
effervescence
good
stuff
but
somewhat
weaker
than
other
great
divide
offerings
ive
had
a
solid
pale
ale
from
great
divide
which
doesnt
go
overboard
in
really
any
direction
i
had
this
with
a
burger
before
which
is
suggested
on
the
bottle
and
it
was
pretty
ideal
md
very
drinkable
and
very
smooth
good
beer
drinkability
over
all
a
decent
pale
ale
i
would
have
it
again
d
great
this
is
for
sure
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
that
ive
had
in
awhile
i
would
definately
buy
this
again
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
transparent
copper
with
a
high
degree
of
carbonation
and
three
fingers
of
white
head
possessed
a
very
subtle
floral
bitter
hop
nose
not
much
else
the
taste
revealed
more
toffee
pear
apple
and
maltiness
with
a
bitterdry
finish
that
lingered
afterwards
very
thin
feel
to
this
one
good
for
sessioning
however
i
prefer
some
more
body
and
nose
to
it
drinkability
is
great
a
great
example
of
true
english
pale
ale
d
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
will
definitely
become
a
regular
bottled
on
feb
8
2010
but
has
been
in
my
fridge
for
the
last
month
so
hopefully
it
held
up
reasonably
well
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
half
inch
of
white
head
that
held
up
well
quite
a
bit
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
not
much
for
carbonation
bubbles
after
the
pour
i
get
a
lot
of
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
makes
me
think
more
american
than
english
just
a
hint
of
floral
in
the
aroma
as
well
flavor
features
the
citrus
hops
as
well
a
little
too
much
caramel
malt
for
my
taste
sort
of
has
an
artificial
plastic
flavor
bitterness
is
high
for
an
english
style
more
substanital
body
than
other
pale
ales
carbonation
is
very
gentle
but
this
beer
is
far
from
flat
a
beer
that
is
very
good
in
some
ways
but
falls
just
short
in
others
get
this
i
loved
it
the
beer
has
a
good
body
to
it
and
is
wonderfully
drinkable
this
is
a
really
good
pale
ale
better
than
several
ive
tried
recently
its
no
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
itll
do
d
very
drinkable
flavors
are
there
and
not
overbearing
actually
a
really
nice
drinkable
pale
ale
d
a
little
too
hoppy
for
the
english
pale
ale
description
on
the
label
a
decent
ipa
or
apa
but
not
one
that
i
would
get
a
second
pint
of
malt
sweetness
a
little
too
much
up
front
bitterness
lingering
a
bit
much
for
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
an
english
pale
great
divide
denver
pale
ale
is
a
clear
sparkling
golden
ale
with
a
dense
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
to
blotchy
film
and
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
wooden
and
leafy
aroma
its
all
hops
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
and
a
dry
finish
theres
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
the
dry
crackery
malt
lays
low
its
mostly
the
flavor
of
yummy
hops
this
is
an
excellent
bitter
session
ale
really
tasty
stuff
drinkability
is
good
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
buy
again
yes
pours
a
light
goldenorange
color
topped
off
with
a
decent
amount
of
light
beige
foam
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
the
nose
just
a
little
biscuit
malt
and
some
inoffensive
british
hops
similar
flavors
to
those
mentioned
above
sweet
malt
cut
with
a
little
grassy
hops
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
longshot
a
decent
solid
beer
but
far
from
interesting
overall
this
is
a
fine
english
pale
riding
the
line
with
american
pale
ale
another
strong
offering
from
great
divide
d
this
is
a
very
nice
balance
brew
it
is
restrained
although
i
would
say
a
tiny
bit
sweet
for
the
style
taste
the
beer
is
lighly
smokey
a
good
dose
off
hop
bitterness
the
best
before
date
is
near
and
i
am
afreight
that
the
beer
has
had
it
s
best
time
next
i
will
surge
for
a
fresher
one
i
liked
it
enough
to
give
it
a
second
try
some
bread
and
spicy
cereal
blends
nicely
with
late
addition
hops
overall
a
decent
pint
got
this
as
part
of
the
current
great
divide
sampler
pack
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
decent
off
white
head
smell
is
a
little
faint
and
mostly
malty
has
a
definite
english
malt
flavor
up
front
with
an
earthy
resiny
hop
finish
hops
were
a
little
more
subtle
than
i
would
have
liked
however
still
felt
this
was
a
solid
offering
drinkability
is
pretty
high
with
this
one
when
i
finished
the
three
in
the
sampler
i
was
a
little
sad
not
to
have
more
had
this
with
hyland
from
his
great

pack
poured
an
ambertan

spotty
lacing
nothing
overpowering
but
had
a
light
hoppy
smell
with
a
malt
backbone
it
had
a
big
malts
up
front
with
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
flavor
despite
the
light
aroma
this
was
surprisingly
solid
well
balanced
ale
alot
better
than
i
expected
i
can
definately
put
a
few
of
these
back
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
apv
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
good
amount
of
these
sitting
outside
in
the
middle
of
the
day
this
brewery
does
other
things
better
look
elsewhere
for
a
good
pale
ale
the
bottle
indicates
denver
pale
ale
is
brilliant
balanced
i
am
inclined
to
agree
its
certainly
not
the
most
memorable
of
pale
ales
but
its
pretty
darn
solid
especially
considering
its
about
two
months
old
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
appears
a
brilliant
copper
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
the
foam
pours
on
thick
and
dwindles
slowly
leaving
behind
fine
speckled
lacing
patterns
between
sips
a
very
nice
appearance
aromatics
offer
up
a
nice
bread
dough
or
biscuit
malt
sweetness
with
dry
yeast
notes
on
the
backend
comes
delicate
floral
and
light
citric
hops
flowing
flavor
is
beautifully
balanced
apa
not
aggressive
with
hop
bitterness
but
has
herbal
and
floral
hop
flavor
malts
are
nice
with
biscuit
malt
flavors
holding
up
the
backbone
of
this
brew
it
is
definitely
english
style
compared
to
most
apas
you
almost
ask
yourself
where
are
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
slighty
oily
texture
going
on
carbonation
is
soft
and
mild
which
fits
the
flavor
profile
well
drinkability
is
solid
if
i
had
a
sampler
pack
of
the
gd
offerings
this
would
be
no
problem
medium
bodied
firm
and
dry
a
nice
drinkable
pale
ale
poured
from
a
cellar
temperature
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
light
copper
color
nearly
golden
its
very
clear
and
has
a
thick
head
of
slightly
tan
bubbles
there
is
some
patchy
lacing
left
behind
as
this
head
settles
it
has
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
has
a
bit
hop
to
it
both
bitter
and
piney
otherwise
there
is
some
dry
malt
flavor
with
a
kiss
of
sweetness
there
is
a
bit
of
coating
but
nothing
significant
the
carbonation
is
average
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
but
it
isnt
all
that
complex
it
doesnt
demand
your
attention
you
could
easily
drink
it
out
of
habit
not
out
of
enjoyment
this
bottle
is
a
little
old
it
may
have
a
more
nuanced
flavor
when
it
is
fresher
d
will
stumble
upon
this
again
must
track
down
the
yeti
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
nice
golden
yellow
color
nose
shows
nice
hops
with
some
citrus
notes
as
far
as
the
palate
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
the
hops
are
balanced
with
a
creaminess
usually
common
among
english
style
pale
ales
finishes
somewhat
bitter
and
leaving
you
wanting
more
this
is
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
an
excellent
pale
ale
and
i
must
add
this
to
my
list
of
must
have
beers
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
right
to
the
finish
i
found
myself
able
to
drink
a
whole
glass
in
about
10
minutes
without
any
trouble
very
refreshing
i
am
a
malt
head
but
i
like
this
a
lot
i
cannot
wait
until
warmer
weather
comes
so
i
can
sit
on
my
porch
barbecue
some
ribs
and
sip
this
ale
on
a
warm
afternoon
great
divide
has
another
solid
brew
here
great
minds
drink
alike
love
it
na
zdravje
d
very
sessionable
i
love
the
english
take
on
a
pale
ale
itd
be
easy
for
a
colorado
brewery
to
throw
out
another
american
version
but
i
really
like
the
subtleties
in
this
beer
its
deftly
balanced
crisp
drinkable
refreshing
and
interesting
a
welcome
holiday
from
the
citrus
bombs
which
i
also
really
like
not
to
mention
its
one
of
the
few
fresh
englishstyle
pale
ales
available
to
me
regularly
md
gd
really
did
their
homework
on
this
beer
since
it
fits
the
style
perfectly
no
real
big
flavors
but
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
this
beer
went
great
with
some
cheshire
cheese
very
drinkable
brew
this
would
make
a
great
summer
brew
if
youre
into
ales
refreshing
without
being
too
light
in
body
great
brew
value
for
what
it
is
i
think
the
value
is
pretty
good
could
be
a
buck
or
so
cheaper
notes
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
pale
ale
i
do
enjoy
and
recommend
it
d
clean
flavors
and
a
great
feel
lend
to
high
drinkability
on
this
one
could
make
for
a
very
nice
session
brew
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
again
drinkability
a
good
but
average
example
of
the
craft
pale
ale
style
poured
from
a
cellartemperature
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
and
a
big
rich
offwhite
head
bubbles
in
the
head
are
a
variety
of
sizes
and
it
leaves
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
with
traces
of
yeast
and
hop
the
flavor
is
big
on
malt
with
a
dry
hop
bitterness
taking
over
toward
the
end
there
are
other
flavors
lending
complexity
to
the
brew
but
i
cant
quite
identify
what
im
tasting
i
just
know
its
good
carbonation
is
present
but
not
overly
so
keeping
the
flavors
moving
but
not
making
the
beer
feel
too
crisp
or
thin
and
there
is
a
good
amount
of
malty
body
to
this
beer
this
is
a
hearty
pale
very
drinkable
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
drinking
but
not
so
interesting
that
im
getting
a
flavor
burnout
d
drinks
fine
nice
dry
finish
all
in
all
nothing
terribly
special
about
this
one
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
great
divide
and
thus
a
good
session
beer
pretty
damn
drinkable
not
very
bitter
but
has
a
solid
flavor
and
mouthfeel
that
makes
drinking
a
couple
of
these
no
gargantuan
feat
a
good
beer
d
i
would
say
many
of
these
could
go
down
but
it
might
get
boring
a
solid
one
two
of
malt
and
hops
in
its
style
drinkability
goes
down
really
smooth
and
shows
just
how
easy
it
is
to
down
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
will
continue
shopping
from
great
divide
as
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
an
ipa
from
them
overall
smooth
drinking
liplicking
beer
that
perhaps
is
stronger
overall
than
its
idividual
aspects
the
taste
is
clean
clear
and
pleasantas
versatile
a
paleas
ive
had
ina
while
besting
the
stoudts
offering
pours
amber
orange
color
dense
frorthy
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
composed
of
piney
and
grapefruit
hops
blended
with
nicely
roasted
carmel
and
pale
malts
taste
is
slightly
more
mild
than
scent
dictates
but
follows
the
same
patern
of
piney
and
grapefruit
hops
up
front
with
a
nice
carmel
and
pale
malt
background
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
and
chewy
good
beer
could
use
some
slight
cleanign
up
to
make
it
one
of
the
better
in
its
style
not
a
beer
i
really
enjoy
sipping
on
its
own
but
a
good
companion
to
salty
fried
foods
and
in
my
limited
experience
with
the
english
pale
ales
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
d
very
quaffable
as
i
find
my
self
taking
small
sips
rapidly
one
right
after
another
another
all
around
solid
offering
from
great
divide
definately
english
in
nature
d
this
beer
along
with
firestone
walkers
double
barrel
ale
does
not
get
enough
recognition
because
the
hops
do
not
rip
your
face
off
but
this
was
a
good
drink
a
very
nice
english
pale
ale
great
divide
brews
great
beers
and
dpa
is
well
crafted
example
while
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
apas
i
would
be
very
happy
drinking
this
whenever
it
was
available
lots
of
drinkability
here
drinkability
this
ale
goes
down
really
smoothly
and
the
hops
wont
taint
your
palette
like
other
pales
having
just
returned
from
the
uk
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
wouldve
loved
to
have
enjoyed
this
in
the
pubs
mediumlight
body
appropriate
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
texture
a
very
easy
drinker
though
not
a
contemplative
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
sort
of
disappointing
compared
to
great
divides
other
quality
brews
it
is
a
bit
heavy
feeling
on
the
mouth
but
is
a
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
average
not
exactly
what
id
expect
from
a
brewery
like
great
divide
unoffensive
at
least
which
i
guess
is
what
some
people
are
looking
for
great
pale
ale
d
i
could
certainly
revisit
this
beer
a
nice
example
of
the
style
although
this
may
not
have
the
maltdominating
characteristics
that
i
love
in
my
epas
certainly
sessionable
too
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
but
i
can
also
tell
this
is
not
the
freshest
sample
i
would
like
to
try
this
brew
again
at
some
point
denver
pale
ale
is
a
wonderful
if
unattractive
hot
day
or
post
workout
ale
this
is
a
wonderful
pale
ale
i
really
enjoy
toasty
malt
flavors
in
pales
and
this
one
has
it
goin
for
it
great
biscuity
flavor
backed
by
a
great
earthy
hop
presence
i
think
this
is
a
extremely
high
quality
pale
ale
and
would
recommend
it
time
and
again
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
epas
that
ive
tasted
granted
its
a
slightly
americanized
version
but
its
good
nonetheless
worth
a
shot
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
what
an
epa
should
be
and
is
an
incredible
session
beer
drinkability
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
english
pale

lots
of
rising
carbonation
in
the
glass
a
very
good
looking
beer
smells
of
malt
presence
and
citrus
hops
kind
of
strange
considering
the
taste
tastes
of
hops
but
i
pick
up
more
pineywoody
hops
up
in
the
taste
with
only
a
bit
of
citrus
first
few
sips
had
large
malt
presence
but
as
the
glass
emptied
the
hops
picked
up
and
it
started
tasting
more
like
an

heavy

as
high
as
it

here
could
probably
session
the
hell
out
of
this
since
it
has
a
good
taste
and
its
not
filling
at
all
will
probably
buy
this
again
and
consume
the
whole
six
pack
in
one
night
drinkability
3
to

wouldnt
be
a
struggle
at
all
to
drink
especially
with
food
and
a
decently
warm
day
this
beer
may
not
be
nearly
as
good
on
tap
normally
or
from
a
bottle
but
from
the
firkin
it
is
excellent
and
extremely
drinkable
i
could
drink
it
all

an
imperial

head
aroma
was
clean
reminded
me
of
fresh
laundry
a
small
amount
of
citrusy
floral
was
evident
taste
was
hoppy
a
bit
of
bitterness
after
sipping
a
bit
of
milky
sweetness
kept
it
pleasant
overly
tingly
on
the
tounge
and
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
kept
drinking
it
faster
than
i
expected
cant
place
why
this
is
a
nice
brew
clean
and
balanced
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
from
great
divide
the
color
is
a
dark
pale
orange
with
a
decent
head
it
has
a
rich
hoppy
smell
but
the
taste
is
more
subtle
with
a
light
copperish
hop
flavor
and
there
is
only
a
mild
bitterness
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
tasted
d
very
drinkable
pale
ale
with
good
flavor
and
balance
it
is
nicely
balanced
in
an
american
way
it
says
on
the
bottle
englishstyle
and
traditional
flavors
chadmc3jun

and
a
nice
caramel
malt
undertone
the
taste
is
just
as
vibrant
as
the
aroma
the
floral
and
herbal
hops
are
strong
without
being
overly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
the
hops
and
malt
flavors
work
very
well
together
the
beer
would
garner
an
even
higher
score
if
the
end
product
was
a
bit
more
interesting
as
is
moderate
carbonation
can
also
be

a
bit
lacking
overall
in
the
flavor
department
quite
light
and
a
bit
watery
moderately
drinkable
if
your
taste
buds
are
meek
but
probably
nothing
id
want
to
have
again
overall
nice
epa
easy

drink
smooth

d
quite
drinkable
because
of
the
5

and
also
a
beer
with
flavor
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
the
beer
pours
with
little
to
no
head
and
presents
as
a
muddled
coppergold
color
the
beer
has
aromas
of
malt
and
the
lightest
hints
of
hops
the
tastes
are
muddled
but
there
is
a
spicy
undertone
to
it
that
is
very
intruiging
unfortunately
there
arent
the
main
flavors
to
back
it
up
mostly
a
bland
bit
of
malt
again
the
beer
is
light
in
mouth
leaving
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
film
behind
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
that
is
for
sure
this
english
pale
ale
is
different
than
american
pale
ales
it
poured
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
what
i
would
call
toffee
scent
upon
tasting
it
had
a
bold
toffee
flavor
no
bad
aftertaste
definetly
well
made
but
not
an
everyday
type
of
beer
something
nice
to
try
good
moderate
carbonation
and
medlight
body
drinkability
on
the
first
drink
the
drinkability
seems
poor
as
the
bitterness
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
flavours
but
as
one
continues
to
drink
they
slowly
come
out
and
reveal
their
intricacies
all
in
all
quite
well
suited
to
sessions
overall
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
my
second
of
the
wychwood
lineup
this
beer
certainly
satisfied
and
left
me
wishing
i
had
more
a
very
drinkable
beer
fiddlers
elbow
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
like
many
english
ales
let
this
one
warm
up
to
get
the
most
okay
maybe
a
fresh
cask
would
get
you
the
most
out
of
this
beer
drinkability
outstanding
pale
ale
the
initial
smooth
buttery
taste
develops
into
a
full
caramel
finish
that
simply
is
excellent
drinkability
a
good
beer
is
the
style
english
extra
strong
bitter
with
unusual
mixture
of
barley
and
wheat
drinkability
a
great
pale
ale
flavorful
yet
easy
to
drink
i
would
certainly
have
this
one
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
drinkability
is
fine
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
ale
one
that
is
arguably
suitable
for
a
session
with
friends
again
the
somewhat
subdued
character
is
a
double
edged
sword
very
refreshing
but
the
overall
character
was
a
bit
lacking
at
the
finish
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
definetly
can
see
myself
downing
a
few
pints
with
some
mates
at
a
pub
a
great
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
as
well
as
lively
overall
its
average
right
down
the
line
a
bit
boring
lacking
in
any
real
defining
character
its
an
average
example
of
the
style
but
regardless
would
probably
taste
better
from
a
tap
worth
a
try
only
if
you
like
wychwoods
output
the
feel
was
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
a
tab
bit
watery
the
carbonation
was
pretty
sharp
and
left
a
nice
tingle
in
the
aftertaste
which
was
quite
clean
and
a
bit
dry
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
relatively
normal
otherwise
im
not
a
giant
fan
d
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
nice
hoppy
fruity
after
taste
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
definitely
its
a
pretty
nice
example
of
an
english
pale
pleasant
and
drinkable
d
its
like
a
good
flavored
water
so
have
a
bunch
solid
english
pale
not
the
best
of
the
lot
but
provides
a
healthy
pint
of
the
good
stuff
when
the
mood
strikes
d
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
real
easy
i
could
drink
probably
2
of
these
16
oz
bottles
with
no
difficulty
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
something
i
would
like
to
drink
with
dinner
it
is
very
smooth
and
the
very
thin
mouthfeel
continues
to
hold
the
floral
and
bitterbready
notes
through
the
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
more
astringent
and
not
as
clean
as
is
common
in
this
style
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
and
it
didnt
stand
out
at
all
poured
into
a
wheat
type
glass
cloudy
yellowgold
with
a
big
head
to
start
that
slowly
goes
into
a
ring
with
not
much
lacing
odd
aroma
cant
quite
describe
it
taste
of
biscuts
and
very
sour
in
the
finish
cant
say
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
was
not
awful
but
just
not
for
me
delicately
hopped
up
front
with
a
nice
biscuit
malt
balance
followed
again
by
a
stronger
hop
presence
and
a
dry
slightly
bitter
very
slightly
tartness
with
some
slight
crisp
fruit
okay
session
beer
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
again
final
thoughts
another
all
around
solid
offering
by
wychwood
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
as
i
enjoyed
hobgoblin
a
bit
more
but
for
the
style
it
is
quite
good
this
beer
i
can
see
going
great
with
seafood
thats
for
sure
certainly
worth
buying
even
if
pale
ales
arent
your
favorite
style
and
a
must
if
you
do
enjoy
them
slight
hop
bitterness
in
front
fades
into
a
roasted
coffee
rich
flavor
with
anise
showing
up
to
on
the
back
end
the
mouth
feel
of
this
is
great
really
full
and
creamy
without
being
to
cloying
the
aftertaste
shows
mostly
the
roast
flavor
and
just
a
bit
of
the
hops
as
well
giving
this
beer
a
spicy
kind
of
aspect
to
it
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
stout
and

some
very
english
appeal
if
thats
your
thing
im
down
to
try
other
brews
from
wychwood
its
been
awhile
i
also
picked
up
a
12
oz
hobgoblin
this
one
happened
to
a
16
ouncer
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
slight
carbonated
and
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
light
the
beer
has
a
nice
complex
flavor
with
an
easiness
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
overall
quite
enjoyed
this
one
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
english
ale
wychwood
is
a
little
underrated
but
they
certainly
make
some
good
stuff
recommend
picking
this
one
up
if
you
havent
already
notes
my
2yr
old
son
was
throwing
a
tennis
ball
to
the
dog
while
i
was
sipping
this
one
outside
the
ball
bounced
off
my
shoulder
and
landed
in
the
pint
glass
i
shrugged
it
off
id
drank
about
23
of
the
bottle
already
and
didnt
consider
it
to
be
all
that
much
of
a
loss
i
went
inside
and
poured
a
nugget
nectar
for
my
next
beer
and
despite
the
nn
being
about
7
mos
old
i
liked
it
better
as
far
as
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
with
a
refrishing
fruity
quality
that
reminds
me
of
hazed
infused
for
some
reason
as
for
drinkability
its
not
a
wow
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
getting
bored
of
it
real
quick
yeah
you
know
i
enjoy
reviewing
bad
beers
and
good
beers
and
unusual
beers
and
interesting
beers
but
mediocre
beers
why
do
i
even
bother
500ml
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
that
settles
quickly
smells
of
typical
english
caramel
malts
and
faint
grassy
hop
somewhat
fruity
the
taste
is
even
weakerrather
nondescript
malt
with
biscuity
notes
alongside
a
hint
of
bitterness
both
tastes
and
feels
watery
characterless
very
nice
would
be
killer
on
tap
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
nice
session
ale
easy
drinking
not
too
bready
and
yet
complex
enough
to
satisfy
a
beer
connosseur
a
truly
proper
english
ale
this
is
the
last
of
the
english
beers
my
dad
left
at
my
house
after
his
last
visit
and
i
wasnt
tremendously
impressed
with
it
thought
it
roughly
comparable
or
slightly
better
than
the
batemans
xxxb
i
am
pretty
unmoved
by
the
esb
style
and
this
one
struck
me
in
aroma
as
mercaptany
at
first
but
that
seemed
to
fade
as
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
glass
still
there
is
definitely
something
composty
in
the
aroma
and
something
pretty
grainy
or
unpleasantly
cerealy
in
the
flavor
color
is
darkmurky
and
cloudy
and
head
is
tiny
bubbles
but
pretty
fragile
aroma
is
vaguely
earthy
and
has
a
vegetationmercaptan
element
also
flavor
is
distinctly
malty
with
a
vegetable
note
some
earthiness
and
a
very
faint
hoppiness
ok
but
not
something
id
seek
out
cant
say
id
recommend
it
but
ive
had
worse
d
i
always
love
a
good
british
beer
and
wychwood
doesnt
disappoint
their
whole
image
is
kinda
out
there
and
i
dig
that
this
one
is
summery
alright
despite
the
overall
sense
of
autumn
and
harvest
and
perhaps
my
favorite
offering
so
far
from
the
brewer
smooth
and
dry
and
flavorful
and
modest
at
the
same
time
something
i
might
seek
a
case
of
this
ones
a
pass
for
me
just
doesnt
pull
it
all
together
in
the
end
and
even
then
im
not
sure
that
would
be
enough
to
make
it
palatable
enough
impressed
with
the
smooth
creamy
head
following
the
pour
that
lasted
well
past
the
half
way
point
while
drinking
it
the
taste
was
well
balanced
but
a
little
more
hoppy
than
expected
based
on
the
aroma
and
taste
i
think
i
would
enjoy
this
one
even
more
served
at
a
slightly
warmer
temperature
i
pulled
it
straight
from
the
fridge
m
slightly
watery
feel
light
med
low
carbonation
goes
down
very
easy
with
little
to
say
about
it
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nearly
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
of
lace
the
aroma
is
really
pretty
decent
lots
of
noble
hops
very
aromatic
for
an
english
ale
the
taste
is
sufficient
for
an
english
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
not
a
lot
of
malt
character
but
still
not
a
bad
flavor
with
the
bright
hop
finish
the
light
body
and
low
carbonation
are
good
for
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
mind
finding
it
on
cask
the
taste
is
similar
lightly
toasty
yeasty
bread
leafyearthycitrusy
hops
all
very
fresh
the
feel
lis
light
and
lively
yet
still
fullbodied
it
is
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
yet
has
solid
complex
taste
and
body
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
carbonation
mid
body
beer
adequate
carbonation
i
may
buy
this
again
wheat
beers
usually
goes
over
well
with
some
company
i
keep
d
this
seems
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
fact
that
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
does
not
seem
very
filling
and
yet
it
has
a
good
taste
that
i
would
not
get
sick
of
if
i
could
find
this
beer
around
where
i
live
i
would
definitly
buy
it
agian
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
and
unassuming
pale
ale
hops
could
factor
into
this
a
little
more
but
all
in
all
not
bad
yuck
its
like
and
esblite
light
amber
pour
forced
a
shortlived
head
out
of
it
dank
aroma
of
malt
and
sawdust
metallic
bitter
taste
with
malt
and
barklike
flavor
it
does
have
a
pleasant
caramel
finish
but
it
does
little
to
save
this
beer
avoid
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
amber
with
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
earthy
caramel
and
honey
malts
and
orange
hops
with
a
bit
of
creamy
yeast
it
tasted
like
earthy
barley
with
dirty
tea
leaves
and
a
bit
of
lemon
hops
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
an
earthy
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
similar
to
the
scarecrow
but
not
quite
as
citrus
and
was
even
dirtier
tasting
it
just
wasnt
a
good
flavor
and
only
an
ok
body
this
was
seriously
only
barely
worth
finishing
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
with
decent
drinkability
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
and
worth
a
shot
i
liked
this
one
although
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
choice
off
the
beer
menu
poured
a
cloudy
apricot
amber
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
off
white
head
is
super
frothy
and
airy
great
lacing
appears
as
the
head
pulls
away
aroma
is
typical
of
an
a
nice
english
ale
sweet
and
buttery
smell
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweet
and
malty
with
a
light
hop
presence
slight
citric
flavor
is
nice
also
there
is
a
nice
toasty
aftertaste
the
flavor
barely
reminds
of
the
gross
old
speckeled
hen
the
feel
is
slightly
thinner
than
i
had
expected
this
is
a
lighter
epa
which
leads
to
extreme
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
epa
that
goes
down
easy
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
special
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
has
a
good
hop
flavor
without
being
in
your
face
overall
a
decent
beer
something
id
enjoy
but
at
the
3
99bottle
price
its
not
something
ill
be
getting
regularly
give
it
a
shot
ill
likely
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
occasionally
to
mix
things
up
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
a
cloudy
amber
orange
with
a
half
inch
of
foam
head
that
reduced
to
a
layer
of
sheen
and
spotty
lacing
had
very
little
smell
but
for
the
trace
of
malts
taste
was
almost
as
disapointing
as
the
smell
sweet
malt
and
mild
hop
flavor
not
bad
but
i
had
expected
alot
more
its
just
kind
of
boring
like
an
english
girl
without
the
accent
good
feel
has
nice
carbonation
and
is
goes
down
easy
enough
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
bought
this
because
it
shares
its
name
with
a
bar
in
throggs
neck
in
the
bronx
the
bar
fiddlers
elbow
does
not
cater
to
ba
members
but
is
a
great
place
to
get
hammered
and
bet
the
ponys
poured
amber
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
leaving
a
little
foam
on
the
glass
nose
was
malty
and
not
as
hoppy
as
i
wanted
taste
as
a
pale
is
average
a
good
dose
of
english
malts
left
an
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
mouthfeel
is
smooth
nevertheless
drinkability
is
average
d
definitly
an
english
pale
with
dry
bitterness
and
a
nicely
different
flavor
good
drinkability
drinkability
excellent
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
what
i
liked
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
fresh
and
crisp
sip
after
sip
i
expected
a
bitter
finish
but
it
never
came
you
know
the
bitter
was
there
but
it
was
subtle
giving
it
a
nice
drinkability
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
for
drinking
on
a
sunny
afternoon
copper
coloured
with
a
fine
head
this
beer
has
a
subtle
biscuit
nose
the
beer
is
balanced
and
quite
tasty
in
that
english
malty
profile
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
which
i
suppose
is
a
recommendation
the
taste
reflects
the
nose
but
with
a
more
earthy
cereal
flavour
present
as
well
and
a
hint
of
raisin
in
the
aftertaste
well
carbonated
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
isnt
exciting
enough
for
me
to
want
to
drink
a
large
quantity
drinkability
not
bad
a
pleasant
highly
drinkable
brew
if
unremarkable
this
one
features
good
complexity
and
balance
with
a
medium
bitterness
throughout
and
a
malty
biscuit
themed
finish
more
assertive
and
much
more
flavorful
than
a
lot
of
the
bigger
name
epas
body
is
not
too
thin
but
still
plenty
smooth
slight
metallic
note
keeps
taste
and
drinkability
scores
from
being
higher
enjoyed
a
small
piece
of
cheddar
with
it
and
can
highly
recommend
the
combination
not
as
good
as
hobgoblin
but
still
a
solid
choice
i
bought
this
in
england
and
the
label
says
4
5
abv
d
this
is
not
a
style
i
know
well
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
mouthfeel
was
as
smooth
as
a
fiddlers
elbow
silky
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
is
the
defining
characteristic
to
mecreamy
not
too
effervescent
but
certainly
not
flat
not
bad
but
not
the
equal
of
hobgoblin
in
my
estimation
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
tangy
hops
semisweet
caramel
with
bitter
citrus
a
solid
earthy
mineral
component
and
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
precede
a
juicy
finish
this
one
is
ok
bit
im
not
overly
thrilled
with
it
good
but
nothing
special
poured
a
beautiful
orangegold
into
an
english
pint
the
off
white
pillowing
head
crowned
the
glass
beautifully
before
it
dropped
back
to
a
solid
film
leaving
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
was
of
subtle
lemons
a
slight
sweet
maltiness
and
maybe
a
little
straw
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mixture
of
a
slight
hop
bite
up
front
a
rounded
malty
breadiness
with
some
buttery
notes
of
yeast
and
finishing
with
a
lingering
bitterness
though
by
no
means
overpowering
this
is
why
i
love
english
pale
ales
and
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
american
pale
ales
are
great
in
their
own
right
but
english
pale
ales
have
this
reserved
character
that
only
opens
up
when
you
really
pay
attention
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
and
never
tire
of
it
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
exapmle
of
a
english
pale
allinall
a
beer
that
i
wound
up
liking
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
not
really
a
fan
of
pale
ales
but
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
500ml

with
a

inch

of

along
with
spicy
herbal

im
guessing
fuggles
caramel
and
biscuit

slightly
nutty
with
hints

diacetyl
with
a
good
english
hop
presence
low
on
the
carbonation
though
not
feeling
flat
with
a
medium
somewhat
aqueous
body
the
subtle
and
moderate
flavor
with
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
heck
of
an
easy
drinker
a
pretty
decent
english
beer
serving
type
bottle
d
nice
session
goes
down
smooth
d
the
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
light
low
enough
alcohol
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
without
worries
d
a
good
little
epa
from
wychwood
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
pints
of
this
good
stuff
drinkablity
here
is
a
4
under
the
right
circumstances
this
beer
would
be
great
with
certain
meals
and
probably
better
yet
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
i
can
just
sit
around
and
enjoy
it
pick
up
a
bottle
you
might
like
it
another
brew
from
a
company
that
ive
really
taken
a
liking
to
but
unfortunately
this
was
the
least
impressive
sample
i
tasted
although
it
was
still
good
and
decent
enough
to
be
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
it
is
bland
in
many
respects
there
is
a
soft
faint
hoppy
aroma
but
no
real
smell
that
can
be
detected
the
taste
is
better
than
your
average
but
overall
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
even
though
i
did
like
it
this
would
be
the
last
wychwood
brew
id
run
out
to
spend
3
50
for
a
16
09
oz
bottle
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
over
the
top
and
the
drinkability
wasnt
superb
although
i
cant
say
it
was
bad
the
beer
has
a
nice
brown
copper
appearance
but
where
it
scores
for
looks
it
lacks
in
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
didnt
enjoy
it
enough
to
down
more
than
one
big
bottle
wouldnt
run
out
to
buy
another
but
overall
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wychwood
brews
very
drinkable
d
for
the
most
part
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
it
drinks
good
so
i
think
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
d
below
average
i
would
enjoy
a
second
one
but
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
in
large
volumes
d
this
is
damn
good
stuff
im
not
much
for
hopped
up
beers
and
this
is
so
balanced
its
very
good
little
on
the
watery
side
but
low
carbonation
just
how
i
like
it
a
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
good
balance
i
may
be
a
little
harsh
in
this
reviewthis
is
a
beer
that
will
quench
your
thirst
and
is
not
too
objectionable
still
it
has
flaws
that
detract
i
believe
it
would
place
fairly
low
on
an
english
pale
ale
flight
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
pale
murky
yellow
color
on
the
pour
but
appears
more
amberish
in
the
glass
and
has
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
nice
bubbly
lacing
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
reminds
me
slightly
of
butterscotch
caramel
malts
and
earthy
hops
are
also
present
mostly
a
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
the
initial
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
countered
nicely
with
a
mildly
hoppy
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
outstanding
either
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
heavier
and
perhaps
carbonated
a
little
more
aggressively
but
overall
is
pretty
smooth
a
very
drinkable
brew
easily
a
session
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
a
decent
but
mild
ale
easy
to
drink
since
it
isnt
too
sweet
but
a
bit
bland
even
by
english
standards
if
you
have
two
or
three
i
suppose
it
is
just
above
average
to
me
as
above
for
drinkability

undertone
color
is
a
dark
amber
and
clear
it
pours
with
a
nice
head
flavor
is
smooth
very
malty
has
a
little
orangy
zing
and
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
tasty
and
pleasant
i
first
tried
this
beer
on
august
13
2007
after
puchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
piured
a
nice
dark
translucent
coppery
red
in
to
a
glass
with
a
generous
loose
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
nuts
and
hops
a
little
spicy
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
some
mild
carbonation
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
some
malty
hints
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
of
the
tongue
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
modest
but
robust
head
and
very
robust
lacing
the
aroma
was
like
haygrass
and
made
me
also
think
of
lake
water
in
a
relatively
nice
way
earthy
first
impression
is
that
its
very
refreshing
with
a
citrus
tang
on
the
tongue
then
a
dry
mildly
bitter
hops
sense
hits
at
the
finish
the
earthiness
quickly
gives
way
to
this
tart
dry
finish
which
hangs
in
the
aftertaste
still
its
quite
drinkable
i
liked
it
though
it
felt
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
a
tight
frothy
head
shrank
to
about
an
18
of
an
inch
which
lasted
throughout
the
sitting
nice
lacing
which
clung
to
the
glass
in
patches
to
the
finish
smell
reminded
me
of
a
dank
dingy
basement
which
you
would
assume
would
carry
over
to
the
taste
not
this
to
me
reminded
me
of
an
american
lager
with
some
muscle
medium
body
and
a
nice
amber
color
first
nose
hit
reminded
me
of
a
bag
of
lays
potato
chips
bitter
and
slighty
slightly
hoppy
a
nice
blend
with
nothing
overpowering
another
would
not
turn
this
down
plain
and
simple
liked
it
d
a
very
nice
pale
ale
a
good
hop
taste
overall
no
boats
are
rocked
by
this
brew
but
its
a
solid
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
in
the
english
style
no
crazy
hops
here
just
a
good
mild
blend
of
malts
and
hops
in
an
easilyquaffable
mixture
worth
a
try
notes
not
much
to
say
have
just
about
anything
from
this
brewers
main
lineup
and
it
has
alot
of
similarities
to
this
sort
of
a
blah
effortless
tasting
brew
one
of
the
best
bottled
pale
ales
or
is
it
a
bitter
i
have
had
great
stuff
d
not
bad
i
wont
have
this
again
i
think
a
statement
true
for
all
wychwood
brews
i
have
had
to
date
it
is
very
english
and
very
mild
not
worth
seekign
out
and
not
even
really
worth
it
if
there
is
another
cracft
brew
to
try
available
i
may
not
have
given
this
beer
a
fair
shake
because
i
reviewed
it
right
after
its
delicious
brother
hobgoblin
ive
come
to
expect
little
from
this
brewery
and
this
has
only
fueled
the
fire
bland
and
uninspiring
nothing
particularly
redeeming
to
be
honest
a
pretty
poor
ale
overall
a
decent
epa
drinkability
nothing
great
its
worth
a
shot
poured
a
hazy
copper
to
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
settled
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
nose
of
malts
and
hops
with
some
citrus
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
and
smooth
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
flavor
was
of
hops
and
malts
with
some
spices
finish
slightly
bitter
a
well
crafted
and
drinkable
brew
a
very
enjoyable
english
pale
ale
that
is
quite
tasty
and
flavorful
wellbalanced
and
nice
to
drink
id
definitely
recommend
this
and
have
it
again
myself
finally
wychwood
is
using
brown
bottles
and
i
look
forward
to
sampling
their
line
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
clear
copper
color
and
thin
head
that
dissipates
into
decent
lacing
there
is
not
much
aroma
to
the
beer
but
what
is
present
is
a
grassy
mildly
hoppy
fragrance
similarly
in
taste
it
tends
toward
an
earthy
grassy
hop
flavor
with
hints
of
citrus
and
caramel
the
beer
favors
its
hoppiness
but
there
is
a
viable
malt
presence
but
not
enough
to
embolden
the
beers
body
which
is
a
bit
thin
but
moderate
carbonation
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
a
fair
ale
but
not
overly
remarkable
enjoyable
but
a
bit
watery
for
my
tastes
a
lagerish
syrian
hopped
ale
light
colour
with
some
creaminess
in
the
pour
a
tad
cheesy
aroma
some
bitterness
and
middling
mouthfeel
and
a
half
pint
is
all
i
could
drink
not
the
entire
pint
yes
citrus
and
caramel
just
minimally
satisfying
to
me
the
taste
is
a
fairly
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
some
hop
spiciness
thrown
in
at
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
some
diacetyl
flavoring
not
a
bad
beer
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
engish
session
ale
this
was
from
a
500
ml
bottle
will
look
to
see
if
it
comes
in
12
oz
6packs
quite
rounded
and
balanced
a
nicely
done
and
satisfying
pale
ale
its
definitely
worth
a
try
its
a
truly
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
pours
a
honeygold
with
a
restrained
offwhite
head
the
aroma
carries
both
a
piney
hops
note
and
a
rich
malt
aroma
which
was
particularly
impressive
the
flavors
hold
true
to
the
aromas
teasing
with
a
rich
but
not
overwhelming
malt
body
and
hop
bite
that
stays
though
for
a
clean
aftertaste
that
begs
for
another
sip
overall
a
wellbalanced
quaff
a
very
sessionable
drink
if
price
is
not
an
object
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
but
muted
flavors
and
some
slight
off
flavors
that
might
be
yeast
qualities
that
im
just
not
used
to
there
are
some
fruity
notes
that
come
through
as
it
warms
that
leads
me
to
believe
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
cask
but
in
bottles
it
just
doesnt
travel
well
a
pleasant
brown
color
with
a
slight
amber
hue
to
it
it
smells
sweetly
hoppy
almost
chocolaty
it
tastes
both
sweat
and
citric
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
orange
it
has
a
pleasant
yet
strong
hoppy
bite
to
end
it
off
it
is
also
nicely
smooth
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
it
is
an
interesting
mix
of
tastes
that
all
seem
to
work
together
and
is
all
around
a
very
pleasant
beer
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
in
the
end
almost
hints
of
bitter
root
and
caramel
average
body
drinkability
is
great
its
a
nice
solid
straightforward
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
definitely
enjoyable
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
mouthfell
a
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
great
smoothness
to
it
poured
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
amber
look
with
a
small
white
head
malty
smell
apparent
from
the
pour
very
bitter
malty
taste
was
not
too
impressed
by
the
mouthfeel
at
all
very
thin
almost
watery
like
a
light
beer
pretty
drinkable
after
your
palette
adjusts
past
the
first
few
sips
500

deep
golden
colour
moderate
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
pleasant
nutty
and
moderately
hoppy
aroma
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
flavour
has
decent
hops
throughout
hints
of
burnt
caramel
but
the
beer
is
not
sweet
fairly
dry
actually
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
a
good
english
pale
ale
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
but
full
of
nice
flavors
aromas
and
textures
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
malts
and
fruity
flavors
a
mix
of
veryripe
to
overripe
fruits
oranges
apricots
and
figs
follow
up
with
earthy
grassy
hops
for
bittering
and
flavors
quite
sweet
and
bitter
remaining
heavy
and
sweet
intot
the
finish
easy
to
drink
and
lots
of
flavors
and
complexity
a
nice
beer
taste
is
malty
followed
by
a
generous
hoppiness
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
almost
chewy
the
styrian
hops
give
this
a
slightly
different
flavor
very
nice
i
think
this
beer
was
made
for
me
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
that
beg
for
orange
slices
im
also
not
a
fan
of
sweets
this
beer
was
a
perfect
balance
between
all
of
those
pitfalls
sourness
sweets
grassy
wheats
all
in
check
here
some
of
the
watery
feelings
i
got
on
the
second
glass
are
the
only
reason
for
lower
scores
tasted
of
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
crystal
malt
with
a
dry
medium
body
i
thought
that
the
fe
would
have
had
more
body
for
the
malt
flavours
that
were
present
not
as
wheaty
as
id
have
expected
either
nice
easy
bitterness
very
long
hoppy
finish
similar
in
taste
and
design
as
the
hobgoblin
an
awesome
beer
this
bitter
has
all
the
character
of
a
good
british
pale
ale
came
across
to
me
like
a
british
cousin
to
the
anchor
liberty
ale
not
sure
if
others
would
make
that
parallel
i
say
this
influenced
by
the
spicy
hop
filled
aroma
very
grassy
earthy
hops
but
effervescent
in
a
musty
way
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
some
bite
in
the
malt
that
rings
through
the
aftertaste
a
good
finish
quite
cloudy
orange
appearence
and
some
musky
notes
it
seems
like
i
can
almost
taste
some
fruity
notes
an
enjoyable
beer
d
not
so
much
i
could
if
i
had
nothing
else
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
amber
hues
thin
white
cap
that
dwindles
to
some
thin
lacings
on
top
aroma
is
caramel
english
malts
spicy
floral
hop
and
a
note
of
biscuit
flavor
is
biscuit
and
toasted
malt
carmalized
sweetness
hint
of
raisin
and
nuts
light
sourness
and
spicy
hops
in
finish
goes
down
with
a
hint
of
hot
alcohol
medium
carbonation
mediumlight
body
and
dry
finish
i
dont
mind
them
a
little
sweet
so
i
find
this
brew
pretty
quaffable
drinkability

its
not
the
smoothest
flowing
ale
on
the
planet
but
it
gets
the
job
done
aroma
slightly
fruity
but
too
weak
to
tell
much
poured
to
a
bright
copper
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
at
first
sips
i
found
this
bland
and
slightly
watery
however
by
midglass
the
hops
became
more
evident
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
second
half
of
this
beer
and
it
left
a
good
finish
i
could
drink
this
again
as
a
side
note
i
must
say
wychwood
comes
up
with
some
of
the
more
creative
names
and
labels
ive
seen
fiddlers
elbow
came
in
a
contoured
500
ml
bottle
which
had
embossing
around
bottle
below
the
neck
label
and
near
the
base
when
poured
out
the
beer
had
a
hazy
pale
orange
body
and
frothy
head
that
loomed
quite
large
at
first
and
left
lots
of
lacing
as
it
receded
slowly
the
smell
was
very
restrained
with
mildly
earthy
and
spicy
hops
and
sweet
caramelized
malt
the
typical
english
pale
ale
smell
was
followed
by
an
easygoing
but
interesting
taste
the
primary
flavor
was
spicy
from
the
hops
which
was
followed
by
a
taste
wavering
between
minerally
dry
and
dextrinous
sweet
the
aftertaste
was
a
drawn
out
but
muted
bitterness
a
little
more
full
and
velvety
than
a
typical
pale
ale
the
richness
was
detrimental
to
sessionability
worth
looking
into
if
you
want
to
experience
some
english
hops
i
have
to
tell
you
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
and
plan
to
get
more
for
myself
this
was
an
ambercolored
beer
with
a
medium
head
it
had
a
sweet
grassy
aroma
along
with
some
malt
interesting
taste
a
little
citrus
a
little
malt
a
little
hops
i
thought
they
worked
quite
well
very
good
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
try
this
beer
good
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
creamish
mouthfeel
and
a
moderate
abv
that
make
this
an
easy
to
drink
distinctly
different
pale
ale
i
will
definetly
have
this
one
again
cheers

moderate

low

fairly
clean
notes
maybe
ive
been
hitting
the
double
ipa
and
russ
imp
stouts
too
much
but
this
just
seems
really
thin
and
watery
despite
how
the
review
sounds
however
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
really
special
this
beer
didnt
have
any
bad
qualities
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
either
this
particular
sample
may
have
been
a
little
old
and
affected
the
experience
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
other
versions
of
epa

bitter

the

like
this

until

quaffable
but
not
that
id
want
to
have
more
than
the
500ml
attractive

and
not
an
indication
in
any
direction
about
the
contents
bottom
line
this
is
a
great
sessionable
english
pale
ale
that
i
have
no
qualms
about
visiting
again
and
again
i
have
never
seen
this
one
available
in
alberta
but
found
this
out
in
new
brunswick
and
brought
it
back
this
is
not
in
a
clear
bottle
as
all
the
other
wychwood
bottles
seem
to
bethis
is
brown
i
love
the
wychwood
bottles
and
their
labels
fiddlers

lovely
dark

creamy
tight

creamcoloured
sufficient
lacing
the
colouration
is
very
different
somehow
somewhere
in
between
rusty
water
and
apricot
very
nice
aroma
mmm
lovely
styrian
goldings
hops
here
adding
that
caramelbutterscotch
richness
i
love
in
english
pale

a
very
buttery
smell
soft
and
creamy
and
very
pleasant
on
the
nosenothing
is
overpowering
lovely
balance
here
softly
roasted
malts
burnt
bread
some
cinnamon
and
those
perfumey
hops
nothing
extraordinary
just
very
pleasing
to
the
nose
the
body
is
fairly
light
but
the
carbonation
is
low
and
creamy
and
satisfying
i
get
very
soft
fruit
flavours
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
in
the
middle
some
woodlike
hops
and
a
little
caramel
maltiness
followed
by
a

finish
the
hops
lingering
on
the
breath
i
get
only
a
tiny
hint
of
any
wheatmalti
think
it
is
felt
more
in
the
body
than
tasted
good
malt
tastes
though
and
a
nice
kick
of
hops
very
gentle
on
the
tongue
a
great
session
brew
i
would
dance
with
the
fiddler
again
cant
go
wrong
here
solid
this
in
03
when
he
reviewed
so
i
guess
ill
pat
my
self
on
the
back
this
one
poured
great
with
a
luscious
head
that
dwindled
to
a
thin
disc
i
liked
what
i
smelled
floral
and
earthy
it
has
a
nice
flavour
leaving
a
hoppy
aftertaste
that
i
would
crank
up
a
notch
but
i
am
a
hophead
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
very
nice
label
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
this
is
not
bad
worth
having
again
in
the
future
for
a
change
of
pace
i
love
their
packaging
of
this
ale
nice
bottle
and
a
cool
label
good
typical
english
aroma
profile
very
malty
with
some
nice
hopping
in
the
back
light
amber
in
appearance
with
a
small
splotchy
off
white
head
taste
is
quintessentially
sp
english
malty
and
nutty
in
character
some
hints
of
pipe
tobbacco
also
ok
mouthfeel
nothing
too
exciting
but
not
too
bad
very
drinkable
nice
ale
taste
it
has
a
bit
of
a
lager
element
with
a
strong
citrus
presence
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
flat
flavor
and
a
flat
body
as
well
seems
like
it
would
pair
really
well
with
citrus
marinated
fish
or
pork
d
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
too
much
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
for
the
price
its
not
really
worth
it
to
me
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
my
tastes
im
very
picky
about
my
carbonation
levels
but
a
good
moderate
body
on
this
brew
drinkability
is
also
good
at
the
price
per
bottle
i
paid
its
certainly
not
a
session
beer
but
if
it
were
the
price
of
a
domestic
or
even
on
the
lower
end
of
the
premium
prices
i
would
definitely
drink
this
somewhat
regularly
not
because
its
that
great
but
because
its
a
solid
allrounder
thats
a
good
change
from
my
normal
preference
of
maltier
brews
and
hefes
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
but
if
someone
offered
me
a
glass
id
be
happy
to
knock
it
down
smooth
crisp
feel
with
nice
tingly
sensation
left
in
the
mouth
very
good
carbonation
ill
grab
another
one
of
these
beer
is
very
drinkable
year
round
interesting
bottle
and
label
art
although
a
brown
bottle
would
make
me
a
little
more
comfortable
though
this
is
a
bit
too
bubbly
for
me
i
still
find
this
beer
to
be
rather
refreshing
and
a
good
pint
so
much
better
than
it
was
in
clear
bottles
mouthfeel
is
sticky
nice
carbonation
cuts
through
the
stickiness
a
bit
and
makes
for
an
above
average
beer
not
quite
a
solid
session
beer
but
i
would
have
another
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
a
wee
little
head
there
are
some
spice
and
apple
cider
aromas
murky
mouthfeel
neither
crisp
nor
smooth
the
flavors
are
muddled
malt
whaet
apple
pear
and
other
summer
fruit
flavors
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
unimpressive
and
a
mixed
bag
of
no
real
outstanding
or
even
stand
up
flavors
even
though
this
is
only
my
third
beer
from
this
brewery
im
beginning
to
think
that
were
i
to
drink
the
entire
wychwood
line
i
wouldnt
find
an
impressive
specimen
in
the
bunch
the
dark
bottles
are
an
improvement
and
long
overdue
but
wholesale
recipe
changes
are
in
order
if
the
beer
has
any
hope
of
ever
matching
the
shelf
appeal
of
the
bottles
and
labels
significantly
more
pleasant
and
less
flawed
than
other
wychwood
beers
ive
sampled
hardly
better
than
average
when
compared
to
better
brews
however
md
with
very
clean
mouthfeel
and
livelyenough
texture
this
beer
is
not
flavoursome
enough
to
be
really
enjoyable
or
quaffable
the
hidden
subtleness
which
i
cant
quite
grasp
perhaps
is
its
strength
but
i
personally
think
its
too
timid
in
terms
of
taste
esp
when
compared
with
its
aroma
o
k
beer
to
try
once
in
a
lifetime
in
short
then
this
beer
starts
off
quite
badly
but
soon
redeems
itself
not
my
personal
favourite
but
i
may
give
it
a
second
chance
in
future
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
though
its
not
fantastic
a
good
fallback
choice
in
a
sparsely
stocked
lcbo
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
nothing
spectacular
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
wouldnt
spit
it
out
either
first
of
all
this
brew
didnt
seem
lightstruck
like
id
half
expected
so
i
was
off
to
a
good
start
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
thin
unremarkable
white
head
little
lace
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
malt
and
fruit
the
fruit
really
comes
out
in
this
onepear
apple
ripe
peachesvery
nice
theres
caramel
and
a
little
restrained
floral
hoppiness
in
the
smell
as
well
this
brew
is
quite
well
balanced
with
a
mild
satisfying
flavor
the
front
has
a
very
slight
sweetness
coupled
with
just
a
little
butterscotch
the
brew
however
is
a
little
more
slick
and
oily
than
necessary
and
i
found
that
quality
a
little
distracting
still
this
is
a
decent
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
english
ale
which
is
moderately
hopped
although
nothing
extraordinary
stands
out
in
this
ale
it
is
still
a
pleasing
session
brew
probably
the
best
pale
ale
by
the
wychwood
brewery
but
that
is
not
saying
much
clear
amber
color
with
a
ok
head
presents
a
smell
of
light
caramel
malt
laced
with
delicate
hops
the
taste
is
much
the
same
and
again
everything
is
covered
in
salt
it
has
a
decent
body
to
it
and
i
wasnt
wishing
for
death
as
i
finished
it
interesting
choice
tonight
paid
4
50
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
at
a
local
pizza
place
best
part
about
this
one
was
the
bottle
itself
very
cool
engravings
of
the
witch
logo
around
the
top
with
an
interesting
drawing
of
what
else
but
a
fiddler
nothing
exciting
about
this
pale
ale
especially
in
comparison
to
so
many
other
great
ones
out
there
not
too
hoppy
average
lacing
and
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
finish
but
nothing
that
got
me
excited
to
try
another
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
small
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
pretty
malty
some
spicy
hops
are
present
taste
begins
sweet
moves
to
a
rich
malty
middle
then
finishes
with
some
pleasant
hoppy
bitterness
mouth
is
smooth
medium
bodied
refreshing
and
a
good
session
ale
very
good
id
like
to
have
this
again
3
49
can
convince
me
my
gut
was
right
nice
call
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
one
either
somewhat
attractive
with
a
bit
of
a
head
atop
an
amber
body
grassy
hop
smell
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
behind
it
the
taste
is
pleasant
with
a
buttery
sweetness
to
it
and
some
grassy
hop
notes
that
were
present
in
the
smell
a
bit
of
a
chewy
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
not
bad
drinkability
seeing
how
this
was
a
clear
bottle
and
the
fact
that
i
got
it
in
a
close
out
basket
for
1
99
i
was
preparing
for
a
skunkfest
but
it
turned
out
to
be
ok
and
to
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
bitter
english
hops
work
good
with
the
malt
plus
its
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
when
i
opened
the
bottle
i
really
noticed
a
big
fruityjuicy
aroma
it
was
very
nice
and
upfront
to
say
the
leastpoured
perfectly
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
a
light
golden
with
a
thin
wispy
headafter
pouring
a
bit
i
also
picked
up
some
iron
in
the
aroma
wch
i
didnt
pick
up
when
opening
flavors
are
not
as
up
front
as
the
aromas
for
sure
but
there
is
a
nice
fruitiness
and
quite
buttery
with
a
faint
grassiness
from
stryian
hops
that
dryes
this
ale
a
bit
in
the
finish
a
pretty
quaffable
ale
not
great
but
drinkableprobably
the
best
offering
from
this
english
brewery
i
have
had
to
date
overall
i
could
have
this
now
and
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
there
is
nothing
that
stands
out
and
says
drink
me
but
it
is
enjoyable
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
it
is
worth
the
try
500
ml
bottle
hand
carried
from
england
as
a
gift
bottle
now
brown
not
the
clear
one
pictured
at
time
of
this
review
pours
crystalclear
dark
amber
with
an
ecru
fluffy
head
that
is
generous
but
begins
to
fade
too
soon
does
leave
some
lacing
nose
is
what
i
expect
in
an
english
ale
taste
surprised
me
nice
sweet
malt
but
hoppier
than
i
expected
are
these
fuggle
hops
a
bit
of
citrus
a
bit
of
grapefruit
offsetting
the
malts
had
only
one
to
sample
but
id
say
this
is
drinkable
all
night
pours
a
nice
somewhat
light
amber
smells
a
touch
skunky
with
a
nice
mellow
fruity
hopmalt
sweetness
being
the
overall
picture
very
english
pa
like
pretty
flavorfull
doughy
and
a
bit
buttery
with
a
mild
caramel
sweetness
balanced
with
a
decent
hop
nod
medium
bodied
but
leaning
more
towards
the
full
spectrum
a
most
satisfying
english
ale
tastey
and
balanced
pours
out
to
a
dark
golden
brown
colour
with
a
short
lived
white
brown
head
strong
scent
of
hops
and
mild
fruit
a
slight
bite
upon
initial
mouthfeel
but
nonetheless
smooth
and
easy
flavors
of
hops
and
grain
with
a
very
prominent
bitter
aftertaste
slightly
dry
worth
a
try
but
i
prefer
hobgoblin
creamy
texture
folowwed
by
a
well
carbonated
mouthfee
and
some
subtle
malt
character
very
mild
in
taste
and
nicely
balanced
very
drinkable
other
comments
the
label
carries
the
somewhat
cryptic
phrase
wheat
brewed
of
course
you
can
assume
that
this
means
there
is
wheat
included
in
the
malt
bill
but
wheat
brewed
seems
to
suggest
the
wheat
is
taking
some
kind
of
active
role
in
the
brewing
process
stirring
the
mash
firing
up
the
kettle
weighing
out
the
hops
designing
the
recipe
pours
out
amber
with
a
full
bright
white
head
on
top
kind
of
a
chewey
malt
billing
but
quite
light
sweetness
is
well
blended
with
some
citrus
hop
balance
mouthfeel
works
and
the
brew
goes
down
all
right
im
not
sure
why
we
get
this
beer
in
vermont
as
one
of
the
only
imports
from
a
country
known
for
good
english
ales
but
alas
id
drink
it
over
not
drinking
it
but
id
choose
something
else
if
given
a
choice
once
more
i
have
to
repeat
a
phrase
i
hate
to
use
but
theres
too
many
apt
occasions
not
bad
just
not
much
clear
bottle
from
lcbo
poured
a
redorange
hue
nice
color
aromas
of
pinecitrus
hops
very
pungent
over
the
less
stated
sweet
caramel
malts
1
finger
rocky
white
head
that
stays
a
while
then
laces
nicely
this
is
the
best
smellinglooking
wychwood
ale
ive
sampled
yet
perhaps
i
got
a
fresh
one
unskunked
from
clear
bottles
and
poor
handling
mild
start
where
the
caramel
malt
kind
of
prevails
then
the
tongue
goes
creamy
and
dry
with
wheat
malts
as
a
long
finishing
starts
where
the
drying
is
replaced
by
bittering
which
is
is
gradual
and
prolonged
several
hop
tastes
are
departed
bitter
spruce
to
lime
peel
to
grassy
to
resin
to
metallic
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
bitter
expensive
but
not
bad
the
pour
is
deep
orange
almost
brown
the
head
is
simple
yet
creamy
and
moderately
sticky
aromas
are
of
citrusy
hop
herb
and
some
bisquit
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
crisp
with
a
satiny
texture
flavors
are
very
herbal
with
tarragon
at
the
forefront
malt
and
hop
play
equal
roles
with
the
hop
balancing
out
the
malt
though
the
hop
is
a
tad
bitter
in
a
bad
bitter
sort
of
way
the
beer
is
a
touch
cloying
on
the
finish
this
beer
followed
a
lackluster
scarecrow
ale
from
the
same
brewery
it
is
better
yet
not
something
id
pick
up
a
second
time
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
would
rather
have
a
hobgoblin
if
i
could
choose
between
the
two
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
slightly
fruity
it
is
an
orange
color
with
an
average
head
the
aroma
has
some
cirtus
and
mint
notes
as
well
as
some
grass
it
is
substantially
hoppier
than
i
would
have
expected
and
the
maltiness
stands
up
nicley
to
it
it
finishes
with
a
refreshing
dryness
i
could
sit
around
and
drink
quite
of
few
of
these
a
good
session
beer
fiddlers
elbow
came
in
a
clear
bottle
the
color
was
cloudy
goldorange
with
a
wispy
head
there
was
just
a
little
lace
the
aroma
was
strong
and
earthy
with
a
little
citrus
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
elements
of
citrus
and
caramel
the
finish
was
a
little
dry
and
citrusy
it
was
a
mellow
beer
with
a
decent
hop
bite
and
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
the
label
and
the
color
were
the
best
things
about
it
500ml
bottle
light
brown
ale
with
a
medium
brew
that
didnt
last
long
on
top
of
my
glass
usual
pale
ale
flavor
of
yeast
and
light
bitterness
body
is
a
bit
thin
also
i
dont
approve
of
the
use
of
a
clear
bottle
which
doesnt
help
a
beer
when
it
needs
to
travel
thousand
of
miles
to
get
to
my
place
after
the
scarecrow
im
glad
to
see
a
beer
of
this
quality
from
wychwood
on
2nd
thought
thank
you
to
robbeer
for
leading
me
to
a
quality
brewery
quite
good
and
one
that
ill
look
forward
to
in
the
future
altogether
drinkable
although
perhaps
too
much
for
serious
session
drinking
fun
bottle
like
all
of
the
other
stuff
from
these
folks
enjoyed
it
for
all
its
different
characteristics
but
dont
think
i
would
make
it
a
regular
purchase
the
head
poured
small
white
and
it
had
finesmall
sized
bubbles
the
body
was
carbonated
and
clear
the
hue
was
orange
and
the
nose
was
fruity
and
hoppy
this
beer
left
only
a
sparse
lacing
the
flavor
was
both
very
bitter
and
hoppy
with
an
aftertaste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
it
was
tingly
on
my
tongue
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
lacey
head
the
nose
is
faint
there
is
a
small
amount
of
malt
and
hop
aroma
mixed
with
a
fruity
yeast
smell
the
taste
is
quite
dull
there
is
a
low
bitterness
and
bland
malt
flavor
it
really
isnt
that
bad
of
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
a
low
bodied
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
i
like
the
label
on
the
beer
perhaps
its
only
good
attribute
fiddlers
elbow
poured
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
18
head
i
could
smell
the
skunkiness
from
the
moment
i
removed
the
cap
even
my
sister
who
was
in
the
other
room
could
smell
it
but
i
could
still
detect
the
malt
and
hops
just
not
very
well
tasted
sour
sort
of
a
cany
apple
starburst
flavour
its
okay
but
not
a
beer
worth
buying
again
too
many
breweries
left
and
right
of
the
atlantic
are
relying
on
formulaic
cheap
hop
extractions
to
season
their
malty
waters
this
specimen
reeks
of
grapefruit
and
cat
piss
while
redeeming
itself
on
the
palate
with
a
decent
body
still
it
has
an
obnoxious
flavor
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
for
those
accustomed
to
the
american
pale
ale
this
is
an
intriguing
counterpoint
it
had
a
kind
of
skunky
scent
to
it
that
i
didnt
care
for
and
the
appearance
was
lighter
than
i
would
have
liked
but
there
was
a
nice
head
to
it
i
noticed
a
definite
bready
maltiness
to
it
a
big
hop
bite
came
through
towards
the
end
and
in
the
aftertaste
a
pretty
aggressive
beer
i
could
drink
this
one
again
500ml
bottle
when
i
picked
up
this
bottle
it
was
a
golden
orange
almost
an
ice
tea
color
when
i
pulled
it
out
of
the
frige
it
was
a
cloudy
orange
looking
almost
like
a
weizen
pours
with
very
little
head
and
leaves
no
real
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
citrus
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
hops
the
flavor
is
slightly
malty
with
a
citrus
tang
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
goes
done
easily
and
is
quite
refreshing
a
thoroughly
pleasant
experiance
another
english
ale
reminding
me
of
the
time
i
spent
in
the
uk
pours
with
a
moderate
head
and
leaving
some
lace
sweet
nose
from
the
malts
good
mix
of
malts
and
hops
but
not
overpowering
in
either
nearly
clear
just
a
slight
haze
no
noticeable
yeast
nothing
settling
out
fairly
smooth
and
light
carbonation
very
detailed
and
artistic
illustration
of
a
fiddler
on
the
label
of
a
500
ml
bottle
with
raised
flying
witch
logo
and
raised
lettering
at
bottom
front
saying
fiercely
independent
beer
is
deep
amber
with
a
small
bit
of
haze
perhaps
from
sediment
head
is
a
nice
beige
and
lingers
aroma
is
of
flowers
and
citrus
but
not
strong
medium
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
and
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
fills
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
much
bigger
and
rounder
than
the
aroma
suggests
there
is
a
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
balanced
with
mild
hoppiness
plus
slight
hints
of
honey
there
is
a
mild
hop
aftertaste
but
its
very
understated
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
when
i
bought
this
it
was
a
nice
looking
goldenorange
color
but
upon
refrigeration
it
turned
slightly
hazycloudy
poured
with
very
little
head
or
lace
not
much
aroma
nor
hop
flavor
when
cold
however
as
it
warmed
some
hop
bite
did
come
through
not
very
long
lasting
however
it
has
a
clean
finish
and
went
down
fairly
easy
not
much
to
get
excited
about
though
nothing
offensive
either
i
agree
with
thrasher
that
the
label
was
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
tawny
orange
with
medium
head
aroma
of
delicate
malts
light
hops
slightly
musty
some
skunkiness
which
faded
away
as
the
beer
sat
in
the
glass
flavors
of
tart
apple
bread
crusts
light
herbs
and
spices
with
a
strong
orange
undertone
very
successful
spiciness
to
this
beer
which
belies
its
sweet
subtle
malt
base
smooth
mouthfeel
lingering
citric
finish
that
grows
a
little
tiresome
certainly
enjoyable
but
the
wonderful
name
and
psychedelic
picture
on
the
bottle
were
the
high
points
of
this
beer
hazy
golden
color
head
is
whipped
creamy
skunk
smells
are
getting
in
the
way
of
what
might
be
pleasant
yeasty
doughyness
light
notes
of
roasted
malt
flavors
that
make
it
beyond
the
skunkiness
some
fruitiness
apple
pear
white
grape
and
leafy
hops
all
are
pleasant
good
but
couldve
been
much
better
my
compliments
to
the
brewers
they
have
given
us
a
smooth
full
bodied
english
ale
that
has
no
lingering
after
taste
sweeter
than
i
had
anticipated
but
certainly
not
over
the
edge
i
will
keep
this
ale
in
mind
flavourful
to
say
the
least
the
wheat
adds
to
the
drinkability
and
the
hops
are
done
just
right
and
pack
with
flavour
another
import
i
wish
would
come
in
sixpacks
the
color
looks
a
bit
like
a
slightly
cloudy
apple
juice
with
a
decent
sticky
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
on
the
nose
there
is
a
nice
fruity
citrus
smell
its
pretty
much
the
same
story
on
the
palate
nice
citric
fruity
bitterness
and
a
light
bready
flavor
and
a
nice
sweetness
nice
smooth
and
somewhat
tingly
mouth
feel
overall
i
enjoyed
it
very
good
pale
ale
another
good
brew
from
wychwood
its
amber
with
a
pretty
thin
white
head
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
was
very
disappointed
to
be
hit
with
a
nose
full
of
skunkiness
despite
the
fact
that
my
shop
takes
good
care
of
its
beer
the
bottle
looks
nice
but
if
this
is
the
price
to
pay
its
definitely
not
worth
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
underwhelming
hops
and
malt
flavor
both
are
on
the
low
end
of
the
scale
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
but
at
4
00
for
a
500
ml
bottle
i
wont
be
running
back
to
the
store
give
it
another
chance
quite
thin
sweet
and
even
a
bit
cloying
once
again
lose
the
clear
bottles
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
a
bit
of
a
strange
taste
like
there
others
light
copper
with
a
pleasant
lace
bready
malty
mildly
floral
nose
well
balanced
somewhat
fruity
malty
start
ends
oily
hop
flavor
with
a
clinging
bitterness
this
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
its
hop
bitterness
flavor
and
aroma
are
nicely
crafted
with
enough
malt
spine
to
make
it
legitimate
what
a
great
english
ale
great
amber
color
and
taste
love
the
bottle
and
label
check
out
the
wychwood
website
for
their
upcoming
beers
if
they
are
anything
like
this
brew
i
will
be
eagerly
waiting
to
try
each
one
hobgoblin
will
have
to
wait
until
my
beer
fest
this
summer
nice
easydrinking
beer
very
mild
in
all
the
attributes
that
i
care
for
like
hopmaltyeast
balance
more
bitter
than
aromatic
but
still
very
mild
by
my
palate
aroma
was
more
bold
than
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
belgian
blonde
in
maltiness
and
yeastiness
but
didnt
deliver
those
notes
on
the
flavor
mouthfeel
was
pleasantly
light
and
carbonation
was
mediumlow
fans
of
bold
ales
may
find
this
a
bit
boring
but
it
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
pungent
aroma
good
taste
for
a
blonde
ale
but
a
little
bitter
overall
i
like
this
beer
sure
as
a
blonde
its
not
especially
rich
in
character
however
its
eminently
drinkable
and
lowenough
abv
to
provide
a
nice
little
session
an
unassuming
but
satisfying
beersmooth
and
refreshing
with
considerable
fruitiness
and
just
a
little
sweetness
and
bitterness
to
keep
things
balanced
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
in
color
with
about
12
finger
of
a
white
fizzy
head
that
settles
down
to
just
the
top
of
the
glass
and
sides
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
perfect
carbonation
for
this
style
of
brew
the
aroma
is
of
hops
right
up
front
with
some
citrus
and
spice
more
going
on
with
the
taste
that
what
the
aroma
suggests
with
some
caramel
malts
hint
of
toffee
and
sugar
as
well
slight
bitter
finish
that
doesnt
last
too
long
though
lighter
to
medium
bodied
overall
it
was
decent
the
taste
is
also
jolly
sweet
i
say
with
an
overwhelming
caramel
and
toffee
note
mild
to
low
bitterness
smooth
to
the
end
bangers
and
mash
please
overall
another
fairly
average
beer
from
wychwood
not
offensive
but
very
average
for
the
price
its
over
100
a
case
of
an
equivalent
case
of
24
x
330ml
for
what
is
effectively
quite
a
boring
beer
overall
a
good
beer
with
a
bitter
after
taste
amazing
smell
that
was
not
entirely
matched
by
the
taste
a
slightly
refreshing
beer
that
would
pare
well
with
a
burger
or
steak
this
beer
is
pretty
much
a
solid
35
its
not
fanatastic
but
definitely
not
bad
fairly
recommended
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
it
is
rather
flavorful
for
the
style
mouthfeel
mediumlight
body
high
carbonation
crisp
finish
o
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
lighter
than
i
anticipated
overall
a
good
mild
thirst
quencher
however
i
would
considered
one
of
their
other
offerings
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
even
more
substance
mb
o
a
nice
rendition
of
the
style
although
to
my
taste
it
needs
more
carbonation
and
more
flavour
touches
very
light
hops
citrus
almost
no
after
taste
put
this
one
in
the
freezing
for
20
minutes
just
started
to
ice
up
took
it
out
poured
and
drank
excellent
super
cold
very
easy
drinking
i
would
compare
it
to
an
ale
version
of
a
flavorful
cold
lager
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
smell
consists
of
bread
mild
hop
and
a
touch
of
citrus
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
the
bread
flavor
quite
pronounced
and
the
hops
adding
a
bit
of
citrus
flavor
namely
lemon
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
but
this
is
to
be
expected
for
the
style
while
the
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
somewhat
sticky
overall
this
is
pretty
standard
while
the
low
abv
and
simple
flavors
it
could
make
for
a
good
session
beer
for
someone
looking
for
a
dry
and
bready
light
brew
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
however
there
is
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
either
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
slight
citrus
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
a
subdued
but
fairly
tasty
citrus
hop
presence
im
trying
to
rate
to
style
and
if
i
was
leaning
more
towards
personal
preference
today
it
would
score
lower
because
id
get
board
that
being
said
they
made
what
they
were
attempting
to
make
fairly
well
o
easy
drinking
english
ale
more
flavor
than
some
others
that
ice
tried
if
the
same
style
o
a
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
it
succeeds
at
that
but
it
has
no
character
nothing
really
interesting
still
a
pleasant
drink
though
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
actually
is
quite
nice
for
an
everyday
drinker
the
skunk
is
a
little
troublesome
as
well
as
a
touch
of
the
kitty
litter
that
i
have
no
explaination
for
anyways
it
tastes
pretty
good
and
while
i
prolly
wont
but
it
again
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
bad
beer
a
good
solid
flavoursome
easily
available
beer
whats
not
to
like
this
is
not
a
bad
medium
ale
it
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
flavour
intensity
could
be
stronger
but
otherwise
its
not
a
bad
brew

o
doesnt
come
across
as
a
pale
ale
theres
lager
vibe
to
this
one
pretty
average
beer
overall
i
always
enjoy
the
wychwood
labels
lots
of
detail
the
beer
however
is
a
bit
too
onedimensional
hazy
and
golden
in
color
the
beer
has
a
slim
white
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
grassy
some
subtle
fruit
notes
are
also
present
in
the
taste
a
little
apple
and
pear
the
beer
is
balanced
with
a
sharp
hop
taste
the
body
is
refreshingly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
its
a
good
beer
but
it
is
also
a
very
average
light
pale
ale
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
in
spite
of
appearances
this
actually
ends
well
musty
citrus
hops
put
me
in
the
mind
of
citra
lager
malt
and
styrian
it
turns
out
aggressively
refreshing
if
there
is
such
a
thing
not
the
usual
high
quality
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
wychwood
brews
not
bad
none
the
less
pours
a
peach
color
with
a
white
medium
fluffy
head
and
citrus
and
grapefruit
aromas
a
little
mild
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
flavor
with
some
malt
flavors
coming
through
nice
taste
with
a
strong
finish
drinkable
with
the
signature
english
hops
that
being
said
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
im
quite
enjoying
it
with
my
sweet
potato
curry
pours
a
cloudy
hay
colour
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
worth
of
foam
that
slowly
works
its
way
down
to
a
half
finger
smells
of
grains
citrus
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
taste
is
primarily
bready
with
a
bit
of
acid
coming
in
with
the
lemon
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
very
light
bodied
medium
carbonated
smooth

this
beer

for
me

to
expect
from
a
wychwood
beer
and
ringwood
yeast
strains
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
i
cant
really
see
reaching
for
this
beer
again
because
of
the
cost
for
less
money
i
will
be
reaching
for
the
lagunitas
and
firestone
beers
for
normal
consumption

but
this
didnt
seem
to
be
that
great
i
wont
remember
it
a
week
from
now
it
had
a
cool
bottle
in
a
good
way
it
was
not
overpowering
at
all
like
an
ipa
but
ready
to
rumble
in
the
background
of
this
excellent
beer
2699
somewhat
watery
very
drinkable
what
flavor
there
is
is
impressive
the
beer
is
dominated
by
herbal
bitter
hop
notes
and
mild
toasted
malts
strongly
hopped
flavor
for
an
english
pale
ale
light
malts
lead
the
way
thrice
hopped
per
labelpoured
a
nice
medium
clear
golden
with
a
well
formed
but
quick
to
vanish
bone
white
head
muted
aromas
toasty
malt
and
a
little
caramel
biscuit
with
a
hint
of
green
hopmore
subtle
but
very
pleasant
flavors
lightly
sweet
and
biscuity
up
front
with
a
nice
drying
herbal
lingering
finish
and
i
mean
it
lingers
i
noticed
a
little
medicinal
quality
as
well
i
lighter
epa
with
good
flavor
packed
into
it
its
a
quaffer
no
doubti
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
smooth
this
may
not
bring
a
power
punch
to
the
flavor
but
this
is
a
delightfully
balanced
and
delicate
beer
i
would
gladly
session
this
over
and
over
a
fair
brew
nothing
exciting
nothing
too
boring
pours
a
rusty
clear
color
with
some
head
little
lacing
smells
lightly
hoppy
and
malty
not
much
there
though
tastes
a
bit
like
bass
more
biscuity
and
bready
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
enough
but
a
little
on
the
thin
side
quite
drinkable
really
refreshing
a
great
session
brew
but
a
bit
pricy
id
probably
pick
bass
over
this
unless
the
price
lowered
three
bucks
for
a
half
liter
makes
this
not
so
great
of
a
deal
for
the
money
im
more
likely
to
pick
up
a
bass
but
this
is
solid
stuff
clear
and
orange
a
big
head
that
goes
away
real
quick
nose
is
surprisingly
more
malty
than
hoppy
has
some
alcohol
spice
and
apple
as
well
the
taste
has
more
hops
than
the
nose
but
otherwise
mimicks
the
nose
additional
sourness
with
a
slight
green
hops
finish
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
500
ml
bottle
with
great
image
and
packaging
i
like
the
shape
and
feel
of
the
bottle
in
my
hand
the
label
says
that
this
is
a
thrice
hopped
golden
ale
i
was
different
than
most
of
the
other
wychwood
ales
except
scarecrow
being
that
it
was
lighter
and
easier
to
drink
i
like
the
ligh
mouthfeel
but
you
still
feel
and
taste
that
typical
english
maltiness
this
beer
will
be
easier
for
most
people
to
drink
due
to
its
lighness
it
was
not
overly
hoppy
but
pleasent
i
likes
the
light
malt
flavor
the
smell
was
clean
and
balanced
plus
i
did
like
to
golden
color
of
tye
beer
in
my
hobgoblin
glass
it
was
not
my
favorite
wychwood
beer
but
i
would
definately
buy
it
again
other
comments
another
okbutnotveryinteresting
beer
from
wychwood
recommended
by
a
marrikas
bartender
it
took
one
sip
to
agree
that
this
guy
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
this
is
one
terrific
beer
a
solid
english
pale
malt
brew
with
emphasis
on
orange
and
appricot
flavors
and
aromas
a
series
of
healty
hoppings
of
english
hops
lends
a
supurb
balance
juicy
fruit
flavors
and
appealing
earthy
aromas
ripe
and
fresh
flavors
and
aroma
abound
medium
feel
and
remains
firm
throughout
finishes
with
a
nice
blend
of
fruity
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
bittering
a
true
english
ipa
and
the
best
beer
that
wychwood
makes
a
lovely
example
of
the
style
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
colour
with
a
pure
white
foamy
head
that
lasted
about
40
seconds
smell
was
very
mild
botanical
dry
earth
and
faint
malts
everything
was
very
gentle
and
this
seemed
to
carry
over
into
the
taste
as
well
finish
was
a
nice
pleasant
dryness
a
tiny
bit
biscuity
and
definately
bitter
i
simply
love
the
english
style
ales
such
as
this
and
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
al
day
long
great
name
and
great
lable
too
pours
to
a
bright
copper
color
with
thick
white
head
that
lingers
throughout
and
slowly
diminishes
to
a
white
foam
cap
with
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
some
citrus
but
not
real
strong
flavor
is
very
tasty
at
first
but
fades
in
later
sips
for
this
thin
bodied
beer
the
finish
is
bitter
as
expected
with
this
much
hops
but
there
is
neither
malt
nor
alcohol
to
help
temper
this
and
so
the
finish
is
not
what
it
could
be
not
bad
not
great
decent
beer
i
would
prefer
it
if
it
had
more
malt
character
d
above
average
but
nothing
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
revisit
it
any
time
soon
md
pretty
lively
on
the
mouthfeel
throughout
though
id
say
its
a
touch
too
fizzy
for
a
mildflavoured
english
ale
however
the
texture
does
benefit
from
the
ending
touch
of
soft
bitterness
and
plenty
of
hops
thus
making
this
a
rather
light
refreshing
bitter
to
quaff
not
that
interesting
and
exciting
though
a
decent
ale
but
nothing
special
here
i
guess
this
is
no
longer
organic
some
taste
in
there
corn
bitterness
had
worse
especially
from
wychwood
overall
yet
another
quite
nice
but
not
really
great
beer
from
wychwood
that
commands
au72
for
a
case
of
12
the
only
really
decent
wychwood
beers
i
have
had
are
king
goblin
and
paddys
tout
yet
all
of
their
range
are
massively
expensive
i
wouldnt
compare
them
to
monteiths
since
wychwood
dont
have
any
particularly
nasty
beers
but
i
would
certainly
not
suggest
them
to
anyone
looking
for
valueformoney
in
a
brewery
ill
continue
to
have
a
single
of
each
of
their
beers
but
a
case
not
a
chance
serving
type
bottle
o
dont
bother
with
this
one
there
are
30
better
beers
on
the
supermarket
shelf
not
impressive
scent
but
smooth
and
nice
colour
because
it
has
only
4
7
alcohol
by
volume
i
can
drink
it
in
a
smooth
way
even
though
it
is
a
kind
of
pale
ale
it
is
more
like
larger
taste
to
me
bottle
poured
into
an
english
pub
glass
on
the
light
side
of
orangeamber
with
quick
breaking
white
head
that
dissolves
into
a
halo
of
bubbles
that
ring
the
inside
of
the
glass
has
a
low
key
mellow
aroma
of
lightly
toasted
malts
like
shredded
wheat
cereal
dry
herbal
english
hops
very
subtle
citrus
peel
lemon
and
orange
i
am
inclined
to
compare
this
to
the
similar
fullers
organic
honeydew
and
i
think
this
compares
favorably
the
malt
flavors
are
richer
the
hops
are
quite
floral
and
recall
faint
citrus
and
fragrant
grass
and
the
finish
is
crisp
herbal
and
slightly
orchard
fruity
the
herbal
flavors
become
more
pronounced
over
time
almost
a
little
sage
or
something
and
the
overall
effect
shifts
from
quite
dry
to
sweet
there
is
a
minor
but
noticeable
metallic
tang
i
find
these
english
blonde
or
summer
ales
to
be
a
tad
bland
and
in
my
view
these
should
not
be
lumped
with
other
english
pales
aw
well
this
one
probably
aint
worth
the
price
tag
im
just
going
to
assume
they
call
it
scarecrow
because
it
will
scare
you
away
from
ever
buying
it
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
light
spotty
lacing
is
seen
that
settles
back
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
nothing
really
special
actually
just
of
some
musty
herbal
grains
the
taste
is
pretty
close
to
the
aroma
with
lots
of
malts
up
from
followed
by
a
slight
bitter
hoppy
dry
crisp
finish
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
overall
it
was
just
ok
and
a
once
try
brew
for
me
not
a
big
fan
of
the
pale
ale
types
as
they
are
all
over
the
board
with
most
in
the
very
average
range
like
this
one
meets
criteria
for
brit
pale
ale
i
prefer
yorkshire
dark
ales
i
have
noticed
some
skunkiness
in
other
wychwood
light
ales
on
draft
in
the
uk
o
well
rounded
british
ale
good
not
awesome
light
and
balanced
lightly
hopped
like
a
reallife
scarecrow
this
may
take
the
shape
and
appearance
of
a
beer
but
its
all
hollow
inside
if
the
people
at
wychwood
had
a
brain
theyd
ditch
this
offering
and
put
their
reasonably
talented
brewer
to
better
use
then
again
this
is
the
same
company
that
brought
us
ginger
beard
and
forest
fruits
so
i
wouldnt
bank
on
it
final
thoughts
go
catch
the
mill
because
its
running
here
this
is
pretty
much
an
average
pale
ale
no
bells
and
whistles
nothing
special
it
makes
me
mourn
for
the
passing
of
fiddlers
elbow
in
ontario
o
definitely
recommended
as
with
all
of
their
beers
its
nothing
thats
going
to
blow
you
away
but
its
very
tasty
overall
not
great
by
any
means
but
pretty
refreshing
and
decent
for
the
style
for
the
price
i
have
no
reason
to
pick
this
one
up
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
serving
type
bottle
which
is
good
final
grade
3
49
a
b
i
just
cant
find
many
things
to
say
about
scarecrow
ale
good
or
bad
its
a
relatively
dull
cleantasting
blonde
ale
that
i
could
see
myself
tossing
back
if
there
werent
already
a
bunch
of
cheaper
alternatives
epa
is
just
a
tough
category
to
really
stand
out
in
pale
ales
are
inherently
mundane
fans
of
englishstyle
hops
and
blonde
ales
will
probably
enjoy
this
one
but
its
not
going
to
be
knocking
a
lot
of
socks
off
overall
ok
beer
but
not
anything
i
would
purchase
again
i
find
the
grape
flavors
and
sourness
combining
with
the
earthiness
not
to
my
liking
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
good
enough
to
make
up
for
that
probably
my
least
favorite
wychwood
offering
thus
far
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
o
overall
a
very
good
beer
with
much
to
offer
to
the
palate
great
beer
for
the
fall
sitting
around
the
fire
mmm
this
brew
has
potential
but
failed
to
pop
for
me
the
smell
and
taste
reminded
me
more
a
an
oktoberfest
style
than
an
english
pale
ale
this
brew
is
too
light
on
the
bitterness
in
order
to
be
a
pale
ale
otherwise
it
is
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
i
found
it
tastes
better
after
it
warms
up
and
the
fruity
and
apple
juice
flavors
subside
a
little
o
tastes
like
a
very
traditional
english
ale
easy
to
drink
definitely
sessionable
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores

with
a

thin
rings
of

the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
fruit
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
citrus
and
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
i
am
also
getting
a
slight
metallic
taste
as
the
beer
warms
up
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
a
bit
boring
in
my
opinion
i
suppose
id
get
board
after
a
few
but
that
could
be
said
about
most
english
brews
ive
had
worth
a
try
and
im
a
little
surprised
it
has
a
pretty
average
rating
pleasant
enough
just
pretty
low
key
outside
of
the
aroma
nothing
really
stands
out
very
easy
drinking
however
probably
a
good
session
brew
i
think
folks
miss
the
point
here
while
yet
the
hops
are
mostly
absent
the
body
ok
the
malt
nothing
to
yak
about
this
brew
is
all
about
the
yeast
its
bready
in
a
marvelous
way
like
a
freshly
baked
multigrain
loaf
from
a
small
whole
earth
bakery
i
admit
clarity
was
low
yeast
mouthfeel
more
yeast
than
malt
and
the
rest
of
the
presentation
not
much
to
talk
about
but
savor
the
yeast
please
remember
if
not
for
working
wonders
with
yeast
the
belgians
might
be
considered
2nd
rate
brewers
meh
no
great
shakes
just
a
typical
bland
pale
ale
from
one
of
the
larger
uk
breweries
aroma
and
flavour
are
dull
and
have
unpleasant
qualities
little
in
the
way
of
aromatic
hops
to
add
interest
or
depth
could
be
too
old
i
may
rereview
if
i
have
the
chance
mediocre
fare
no
need
to
seek
this
one
out
a
disappointment
particularly
in
the
taste
department
amber
coloured
beer
with
a
big
white
head
which
leaves
some
lacing
on
my
pint
glass
it
has
a
slightly
creamy
nose
with
some
dried
fruit
has
a
rich
and
fairly
sweet
fruity
start
with
herbal
hops
emerging
and
creating
a
good
bitter
aftertaste
nothing
outlandish
here
but
it
is
well
balanced
good
but
could
be
bolder
overall
not
sure
how
excited
you
can
get
over
an
english
pale
ale
this
one
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
memorable
or
make
you
appreciate
the
flavors
and
malt
content
you
expect
from
english
hopped
beers
plus
this
one
seems
to
lack
the
hop
flavors
for
the
style
its
crisp
and
as
much
as
a
light
ale
of
its
kind
should
be
the
body
is
what
i
expect
it
is
a
little
on
the
spritzy
side
with
too
little
smoothness
to
carry
it
past
that
and
give
it
much
depth

kickbacks
in

mild

is
a
light
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
neither
flavor
standing
out
too
much
not
too
exciting
on
the
flavor
meter
but
a
solid
english
beer
easy
to
approach
and
drink
and
not
in
the
least
offputting
part
of
a
new
4
pack
this
one
beer
i
have
not
seen
in
bc
before
lighter
in
colour
which
works
with
the
golden
pale
ale
style
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
a
lovely
bitterness
that
matches
the
solid
malt
backbone
the
target
hops
are
a
good
choice
to
bring
this
beer
home
on
the
finish

o
not

should
learn
not
to
buy
a
product
just
based
on
the

overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
but
i
couldnt
pick
up
anything
else
special
overall
its
only
slightly
better
than

and
thats
because
the
hoppiness
never
overpowers
anything

day
afternoon
id
really
enjoyed
it
very
much
o
not
enjoyable
and
unimpressed
such
goes
life
time
to
move
on
it
happens
o
uninteresting
and
unappealing
traded
the
calories
remaining
in
the
glass
for
calories
awaiting
in
the
fridge
read
did
not
finish
not
a
poorlyrendered
epa
but
something
just
seems
off
always
hinting
at
an
astringency
without
fully
delving
into
one
i
got
a
little
bored
a
little
too
fast
is
all
im
sayin
golden
straw
colour
when
pour
with
a
head
that
quickly
disappears
not
very
aromatic
reminiscint
of
a
larger
particular
those
in
a
dutch
style
tastes
slightly
malty
and
fresh
again
making
me
feel
more
like
im
drinking
a
larger
short
larger
like
aftertaste
a
bit
disappointed
because
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
copper
color
with
minimal
head
retention
its
aroma
is
almost
reminiscent
of
a
euro
lager
in
a
good
way
with
clean
grain
and
a
slight
spicy
hop
aroma
the
taste
opens
up
with
sweet
malts
on
the
forefront
followed
by
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
to
finish
it
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
but
not
too
sweet
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
worth
trying
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
mellow
a
palatable
organic
take
on
the
style
inoffensive
with
a
decent
crisp
character
to
it
d
a
drinkable
brew
but
nothing
crazy
for
a
pale
ale
would
not
buy
this
one
again
wychwood
scarecrow
technically
shouldnt
be
lumped
into
one
big
english
pale
ale
category
as
this
is
a
golden
or
summer
ale
so
this
is
a
bit
like
having
a
lager
with
an
ale
flavor
profile
has
a
golden
color
with
light
brown
overtones
a
head
that
quickly
fizzles
out
though
the
overall
taste
of
carbonation
keeps
it
from
feeling
flat
nice
herbal
aroma
with
some
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
what
i
like
most
about
the
flavor
is
it
has
a
little
bit
of
esthery
apple
light
english
hops
crisp
the
mouthfeel
is
not
big
and
malty
so
you
might
enjoy
this
in
warm
fair
weather
i
do
recommend
it
its
organic
that
counts
for
something
ive
also
had
the
fiddlers
elbow
although
that
tasted
as
it
itd
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
way
too
long
scarecrow
is
a
common
sight
on
long
island
certainly
aok
in
my
book
st
peters
golden
ale
might
be
a
more
exciting
example
of
the
style
if
you
can
find
a
fresh
batch
overall
avoid
it
there
are
many
better
organic
beers
out
there
overall
i
seem
to
like
this
a
bit
more
than
the
rest
of
ba
and
then
again
i
only
read
like
7
reviews
of
it
the
hoppiness
is
what
i
expect
of
an
ale
but
its
less
than
that
of
an
apa
or
ipa
which
is
good
because
its
not
either
of
those
things
its
smell
and
flavor
make
it
overall
to
be
a
great
beer
when
ur
not
in
the
mood
for
a
strong
stout
or
ipa
or
apa
and
more
for
a
pale
ale
this
one
is
a
good
one
to
try
it
was
on
the
shelf
among
2
other
halloween
themed
beers
so
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
just
for
halloween
or
not
either
way
its
delicious
in
december
o
i
wouldnt
mind
not
ever
having
this
again
overall
drinkability
well
the
bitter
hop
focus
of
this
beer
isnt
exactly
to
my
liking
but
its
not
bad
just
not
great
either
good
appearance
and
sadly
thats
about
all
i
can
really
say
for
this
beer
there
are
better
golden
and
english
pale
ales
out
there
o
a
very
mediocre
effort
and
the
only
beer
from
wychwood
that
i
have
ever
viewed
as
a
disappointment
unremarkable
in
almost
every
way
a
good
fresh
pale
ale
i
would
by
this
again
this
beer
gets
much
worse
reviews
than
id
imagine
i
wonder
how
much
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
organic
growing
process
i
have
no
idea
how
that
would
affect
the
final
outcome
of
the
beer
but
there
really
arent
that
many
organic
beers
on
the
market
at
the
moment
so
id
imagine
like
organic
wine
making
the
art
of
organic
beer
making
probably
has
a
way
to
go
to
develop
it
was
another
gentle
pour
on
my
part
so
as
not
to
stir
up
too
much
sediment
no
head
but
only
simple
wisps
as
a
result
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
quite
malty
somewhat
buttery
with
a
light
underlying
grassiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
had
a
pleasant
intermingling
of
grassy
hops
and
a
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
semidry
and
fairly
unobtrusive
overall
for
me
this
is
just
below
average
has
nothing
that
really
stands
out
personally
i
would
avoid
this
there
is
just
too
little
to
it
to
make
you
want
more
overall
im
not
wild
about
the
hop
flavors
in
this
one
and
they
seem
to
dominate
the
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
out
a
lot
more
overall
truly
forgettable
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
label
drink
for
a
birthday
gift
its
the
thought
that
counts
ive
always
wondered
about
these
beers
so
glad
i
got
to
try
and
not
waste
the
cash
d
too
bitter
without
a
good
floral
or
citrus
hop
note
i
would
not
get
this
beer
ever
again
or
recommend
it
to
anyone
from
fall
brew
tasting
notes
2010
pale
golden
pour
thin
fast
fading
white
head
the
nose
has
a
little
bit
of
crackery
pale
malt
character
there
is
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
an
oddly
perceptible
alcoholic
nose
the
flavor
is
fairly
fruity
however
with
a
lingering
estery
character
the
body
is
quite
thin
with
mild
carbonation
not
very
happy
with
this
one
this
beer
is
pretty
good
up
until
you
drink
it
appearance
and
smell
are
average
to
good
but
the
taste
is
lacking
in
all
areas
i
almost
hated
it
at
first
but
decided
that
its
not
bad
just
not
for
me
at
all
my
little
disclaimer
though
is
that
i
live
in
the
midwest
in
the
u
s
so
with
no
dates
on
the
bottle
who
knows
how
long
it
sat
on
the
shelves
before
i
purchased
it
that
being
said
i
will
try
it
again
making
sure
that
i
ask
when
the
beer
was
stocked
good
beer
wychwood
brewery
well
balanced
brew
nothing
too
strong
different
interesting
or
overpoweringly
brilliant
but
a
good
steady
beer
in
my
eyes
d
decent
enough
would
work
as
its
own
or
as
a
session
but
there
are
other
better
examples
around
of
the
style
overall
about
as
close
to
a
decent
cask
bitter
as
youre
going
to
get
at
home
very
drinkable
refreshing
im
a
fan
poured
from
a
bottle
the
beer
is
a
golden
color
with
a
tinge
of
copper
with
minimal
head
that
clung
around
the
edges
the
beer
has
a
sour
malty
smell
to
it
it
has
a
strong
sour
taste
for
a
pale
with
typical
matly
flavors
the
sourness
trails
through
to
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
bittersweet
flavor
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
this
is
one
of
my
first
english
pales
and
there
are
some
distinct
differences
between
that
and
us
pales
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
to
expand
my
palate
and
then
maybe
coming
back
to
review
this
again
d
very
drinkable
sessionable
but
would
i
choose
to
if
i
could
reach
for
a
sierra
nevada
summit
or
other
inexpensive
pale
ale
nah
d
could
use
a
little
more
oomph
for
me
i
could
have
a
few
though
on
a
fall
day
d
id
take
it
over
a
bud
any
day
seems
like
a
decent
summer
beer
d
rather
disappointing
considering
my
other
experiences
with
wychwood
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
ill
be
drinking
again
well
this
is
another
completely
average
beer
theres
really
no
reason
to
seek
it
out
but
its
not
really
doing
much
wrong
its
one
of
the
few
organic
beers
ive
seen
so
if
the
organic
label
mattered
to
someone
id
pick
it
up
otherwise
not
worth
it
from
the
500
ml
bottle
marked
dno0725
sampled
on
october
26
2010
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
but
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
has
a
burst
of
yeast
malts
and
relatively
weak
hops
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
enough
but
not
very
memorable
except
for
the
light
yeast
elements
but
the
finish
is
dry
d
easily
a
session
beer
but
the
blandness
leads
you
not
to
drink
more
than
one
this
one
unfortunately
is
really
lacking
in
the
taste
department
its
a
bit
shocking
given
its
heritage
packaging
and
style
seems
like
it
should
be
a
lot
more
than
it
is
so
the
label
had
this
crazy
looking
demon
scarecrow
on
it
so
i
went
against
my
predisposition
to
avoid
nonamerican
beers
and
purchased
this
organic
british
brew
basically
it
tasted
like
coors
with
a
hint
of
bitter
i
was
unimpressed
and
will
not
buy
this
again
the
beers
best
attribute
was
the
marketing
behind
it
awesome
label
art
awesome
name
subpar
flavor
d
i
had
one
and
thats
all
i
think
i
could
do
not
that
i
couldnt
take
it
down
but
it
certainly
didnt
leave
me
wanting
more
d
there
is
some
nasty
aftertaste
in
this
beer
especially
30
seconds
to
a
minute
after
taking
a
sip
it
gets
worse
as
time
goes
on
supposedly
the
beer
is
organic
but
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
chemicals
or
something
gross
drinkability
the
taste
is
a
little
unusual
however
they
go
down
pretty
well
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
500ml
bottle
but
i
dont
really
want
another
one
d
i
still
havent
had
an
organic
beer
that
was
any
good
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
is
the
taste
drinkability
its
not
horrible
but
worth
a
try
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
english
pale
ale
no
this
beer
was
not
for
me
some
bitterness
and
earthiness
i
did
not
like
really
theres
not
much
else
to
say
obviously
it
was
meant
to
be
light
but
that
doesnt
necessarily
mean
bland
in
my
mind
which
this
is
and
i
cant
see
this
being
much
better
from
a
cask
d
this
is
only
an
okay
ale
it
just
doesnt
taste
that
good
couldnt
finish
more
than
a
third
of
the
bottle
down
the
drain
scarecrow
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
halfinch
of
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
little
sweetness
and
some
breadlike
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
the
maltiness
no
hoppy
qualities
are
evident
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
drinkable
enough
but
i
dont
think
i
will
seek
it
out
in
the
future
this
is
an
english
ale
through
and
through
i
love
english
ales
this
is
no
exception
overall
im
not
impressed
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
i
wont
return
to
anytime
soon
d
a
very
nice
english
pale
aleid
like
to
see
more
of
these
stateside
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
would
not
search
for
it
in
a
sea
of
beers
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
worth
the
price
as
i
can
get
a
ton
of
better
pale
ales
for
cheaper
extremely
boring
beer
golden
in
color
with
a
quickfading
head
taste
is
extremely
watery
and
malty
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
any
but
the
most
conservative
beer
drinkers
it
doesnt
taste
bad
its
simply
not
good
either
in
a
word
boring
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
a
layer
of
lace
the
smell
is
a
bit
off
but
still
recognizabley
malty
the
taste
is
unremarkable
light
malt
light
mouthfeel
adequate
carbonation
not
one
that
im
going
to
look
for
again
disapointing
after
the
fiddlers
elbow
drank
a
bottle
of
this
last
night
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
hints
of
corn
in
the
nose
wellbalanced
taste
corn
and
malty
pretty
refreshing
good
drinkability
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
i
thought
this
beer
was
refreshing
and
enjoyable
glad
i
tried
it
out
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
very
little
head
faint
sweet
aroma
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
and
a
touch
soapy
not
a
lot
of
flavor
at
all
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
thin
with
nearly
nonexistent
carbonation
overall
not
terrible
but
nothing
here
to
make
we
want
more
of
it
hazy
orange
with
thin
rapidly
dissipating
white
head
very
mild
orange
citrus
and
hops
aroma
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
very
thin
and
watery
throughly
underwhelmed
there
are
some
hops
flavors
trying
to
break
through
but
nothing
exception
reminds
me
of
the
bmc
versions
of
microbrews
fairly
drinkable
due
to
its
inoffensive
albeit
tame
nature
d
in
hot
weather
i
could
drink
this
all
day
its
kindof
like
a
stronger
higher
abv
esp
sweet
enough
to
feel
like
a
restorative
dry
enough
to
make
me
want
to
drink
more
and
light
enough
so
that
it
doesnt
feel
like
too
much
d
i
cant
understand
why
people
rate
this
so
poorly
in
my
opinion
its
one
of
the
best
golden
pale
ales
ive
had
i
guess
many
people
are
just
use
to
pesticides
in
their
beers
ill
definatly
be
coming
back
for
more
of
this
stuff
great
beer
give
it
a
chance
drinkability
alright
but
not
spectacular
if
my
review
seems
slightly
unenthusiastic
its
because
thats
what
the
beer
left
me
feeling
definitely
are
better
examples
of
epas
and
this
one
left
me
wanting
more
good
thing
there
were
better
things
coming
on
the
night
d
ive
been
out
in
the
hot
ohio
sun
for
the
last
4
hours
and
this
shit
rocks
maybe
im
partial
to
english
beers
but
i
dont
know
why
the
hell
everyone
is
sleepin
on
scarecrowcircle
master
maybe
you
all
shoulda
got
the
brown
bottle
haha
at
any
rate
i
will
bee
seeking
out
a
case
of
this
stuff
as
soon
as
i
locate
the
distributor
who
carries
it
d
undrinkable
d
moderately
high
this
beer
isnt
strong
or
flavorful
but
it
has
a
very
nice
subdued
flavor
that
plays
on
its
carbonation
and
hops
bitterness
goes
well
with
food
this
beer
isnt
really
my
bag
but
i
get
what
theyre
working
in
this
beer
still
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
of
these
pours
a
crystal
clear
orange
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
that
dies
down
rather
quickly
there
are
earthy
hop
and
malt
aromas
the
initial
flavor
is
of
malt
and
the
is
overcome
by
the
earthy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
pretty
strong
in
the
beer
and
doesnt
stop
for
a
while
i
would
rather
have
more
hop
flavor
and
less
bitter
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
the
beer
is
ok
but
i
probably
wont
have
another
one
of
these
no
thanks
with
all
the
beers
i
have
access
to
this
is
not
something
i
could
see
myself
paying
for
again
if
someone
had
it
and
handed
to
me
i
would
more
than
likely
drink
it
tho
overall
an
easydrinking
beer
but
nothing
thats
really
going
to
impress
anybody
d
this
was
ok
to
me
but
nothing
more
there
wasnt
anything
really
special
going
on
but
it
was
easy
enough
to
quaff
the
taste
is
very
fresh
with
bread
lemon
apple
a
dryish
leafy
finish
it
has
nice
bittersweet
balance
its
light
a
little
thin
and
onedimensional
but
solid
and
flaovurful
as
a
lighter
refreshing
beer
drinkable
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
for
my
american
taste
buds
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
other
than
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
was
on
for
style
may
try
again
decent
atmosphere
a
little
complexity
in
the
nose
and
palette
light
but
full
flavored
overall
good
quality
quaff
the
phrase
not
bad
comes
to
mind
it
seems
like
the
basics
are
all
present
and
if
they
were
just
a
but
more
pronounceddeveloped
this
would
be
a
higherthanaverage
beer
as
it
stands
its
still
a
pretty
good
session
beer
and
is
by
no
means
terrible
i
just
wish
it
were
slightly
more
robust
the
feel
of
it
reminded
me
of
some
good
german
lagers
which
i
found
strangely
appealing
worth
trying
once
overall
i
am
having
a
hard
time
findng
anything
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
not
bad
but
does
not
stand
out
either
pours
a
somewhat
clear
amber
colored
body
very
small
whitish
creamy
head
quickly
diminishing
sweet
spiciness
in
the
taste
sweet
and
malty
very
malty
tasting
some
nuttiness
and
dustiness
some
slight
sweetness
lightly
carbonated
very
cloudy
and
translucent
amber
orange
color
lightens
to
the
color
of
yellow
autumnal
leaves
around
the
rims
minimal
head
no
real
nose
fullbodied
with
lots
of
traction
on
the
palate
inching
forward
very
slowly
if
seemingly
at
times
not
at
all
however
no
lift
really
mildly
bitter
emphasizing
hops
with
strong
aftertaste
does
feel
as
if
it
is
foaming
up
in
the
mouth
more
than
youd
like
momentarily
suggests
light
citrus
or
crudité
vegetables
or
raw
corn
latter
in
a
good
way
feels
as
if
its
fighting
you
making
it
hard
to
put
back
certified
usda
organic
huh
i
crack
this
bottle
open
to
clean
out
the
cooler
at
my
package
store
pours
a
light
amber
with
minimal
head
the
smell
does
not
impress
at
all
almost
no
hop
aroma
maybe
some
honey
notes
in
there
taste
slightly
bitter
with
afore
mentioned
honey
but
watered
down
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
carbonated
could
drink
plenty
but
why
would
i
overall
the
aftertaste
of
the
brew
was
not
good
it
tastes
as
though
the
bottle
may
have
been
slightly
skunked
or
on
its
way
d
average
beer
not
something
i
would
actively
seek
this
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
orange
and
sweet
yeast
and
raw
honey
with
herbal
tea
notes
it
tasted
like
honey
malt
and
lemon
and
orange
hops
with
a
bit
of
earthy
barley
and
creamy
yeast
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
decent
flavor
but
was
a
little
muddled
it
had
decent
body
too
and
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
wasnt
very
rewarding
or
unique
drinkability
if
i
would
have
had
a
sixer
they
wouldve
all
been
gone
shortly
after
writing
my
review
scarecrow
was
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
nice
drinkability
very
sessionable
halloween
weekend
or
any
other
for
that
matter
just
in
time
for
halloween
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
not
strong
but
quite
noticeable
color
is
a
clear
dark
amber
and
head
is
yellowish
offwhite
and
not
too
persistent
flavor
is
malty
with
a
crisp
hint
of
lager
flavor
and
just
a
whisper
of
fruit
either
apple
or
pear
texture
is
nice
and
smooth
and
aftertaste
has
a
nice
crisp
tang
to
it
a
drinkable
session
brew
however
this
is
nothing
exciting
this
is
a
very
average
beer
not
anywhere
near
worth
the
premium
price
they
charge
for
it
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
the
malt
profile
is
a
bit
onedimensional
but
i
dont
think
that
should
be
held
against
it
its
an
easy
drinking
smooth
pale
ale
that
is
nice
and
sessionable
something
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
and
not
worry
about
drinkibility
is
high
this
beer
comes
off
as
a
specialized
more
robust
and
complex
alternative
to
your
average
light
lager
a
little
pricey
for
me
but
definitely
a
refreshing
yet
simple
high
quality
ale
mild
complexity
d
this
is
a
wholly
average
beer
not
really
interesting
in
any
way
cant
recommend
it
d
leaves
too
much
sweet
aftertaste
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
a
smooth
beer
with
low
carbonation
that
goes
down
easily
d
not
terrible
not
super
just
plain
average
taste
is
watery
yet
crisp
funky
corn
sweet
malt
some
hops
in
the
back
a
little
metallic
touch
of
citrus
grassy
probably
would
not
have
again
superb
drinkability
and
a
mediumlight
body
make
this
beer
very
refreshing
not
a
bad
beer
not
great
either
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
white
creamy
head
some
lacing
with
this
beer
decent
retention
as
well
the
smell
is
musty
grain
pretty
traditional
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweetish
some
sweet
buiscuity
grains
there
are
some
stale
floral
notes
to
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
bitterish
hop
bite
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
crisp
light
to
medium
bodied
some
carbonation
there
is
a
sharpness
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
that
im
not
fond
of
and
some
off
sour
notes
in
there
as
well
there
is
some
husky
grain
flavors
to
the
beer
but
it
lacks
the
creaminess
to
be
a
really
good
english
pale
ale
the
beer
isnt
terribly
interesting
but
its
not
that
bad
either
my
least
favorite
wychwood
beer
something
seems
really
off
with
the
taste
will
pass
on
this
next
time
in
favor
of
better
wychwood
ales
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
grass
pale
malts
another
middle
of
the
pack
beer
d
i
guess
i
would
take
this
over
a
bud
light
but
it
had
that
macro
taste
to
me
nothing
special
i
would
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
pay
for
it
i
decided
to
pour
this
beer
into
a
heavy
seas
euro
style
pint
glass
what
came
out
of
the
bottle
was
a
beer
that
was
a
lightly
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
bubbly
head
of
foam
this
head
of
foam
quickly
dissipated
into
a
handful
of
white
rings
along
the
edge
it
didnt
bother
to
leave
any
lace
the
aroma
was
light
with
lightly
toasted
malts
tea
leaves
a
small
splash
of
juicy
fruits
and
the
slightest
touch
of
sweet
english
toffee
at
the
end
for
some
stuipd
reason
the
main
taste
is
this
beer
was
carbonation
most
of
the
time
the
taste
was
mostly
carbonation
with
toasted
organic
barley
caramel
tea
leaves
and
a
pinch
of
very
mild
not
too
hoppy
fruity
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
too
light
with
a
tiny
aftertaste
of
juicy
fruits
a
trace
of
yeast
and
some
lightly
burnt
barley
i
guess
that
since
all
the
ingredients
in
this
beer
are
organic
that
means
its
better
for
you
than
your
average
beer
its
good
that
its
organic
but
the
bad
thing
is
that
there
wasnt
much
of
anything
to
this
beer
i
would
pass
on
this
one
again
d
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
better
epa
out
there
the
beer
poured
a
golden
copper
color
with
bubbly
white
head
and
really
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
wet
dog
weird
the
last
beer
i
had
smelled
similar
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
aroma
and
was
wet
dog
not
good
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
i
did
not
like
this
beer
i
will
need
to
give
it
a
try
again
in
the
fall
when
i
can
get
a
fresh
bottle
def
not
a
good
golden
pale
ale
d
i
didnt
like
this
beer
and
it
was
honestly
difficult
to
keep
drinking
it
except
for
the
fact
that
i
paid
for
it
d
not
very
different
from
a
macro
lager
and
a
lot
more
expensive
so
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
or
drink
it
again
d
not
a
lot
i
for
one
cant
afford
or
want
to
drink
this
beer
it
was
3
99
for
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
nothing
special
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
light
enough
on
the
stomach
to
be
a
good
session
choice
and
is
good
nearly
all
around
and
the
organic
bit
helps
a
little
too
now
if
they
only
had
this
in
a
six
pack
brilliantly
clear
dark
gold
with
a
medium
white
head
that
lingers
well
aroma
is
butterscotch
backed
by
esters
and
earthy
uk
hops
some
hints
of
fusel
esters
and
butterscotch
follow
through
in
the
flavor
which
is
backed
by
a
pretty
decent
malt
and
crystal
character
tail
is
a
bit
dry
along
with
more
butterscotch
and
some
nice
crystal
malt
definitely
much
better
since
they
went
to
brown
bottles
kind
of
the
same
thing
as
the
dark
english
ale
i
tried
them
back
to
back
it
drops
off
your
palate
pretty
fast
and
you
are
left
with
virtually
nothing
after
a
very
short
flow
of
taste
even
the
fact
that
it
is
a
usda
organic
brew
doesnt
help
at
all
with
it
i
continue
to
be
pleased
by
offerings
from
the
wychwood
company
my
third
beer
that
ive
sampled
from
this
establishment
and
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
one
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
poured
a
golden
amber
color
that
resembles
a
hefeweizen
a
nice
looking
brew
with
a
sharp
tangy
and
citrusy
aroma
to
match
taste
was
great
similar
to
a
hefe
or
a
witbier
with
its
distinct
floral
and
fruity
notes
without
the
yeast
bottle
says
this
is
an
organic
ale
and
the
exceptional
flavor
can
clearly
live
up
to
that
claim
a
great
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
and
goes
down
very
smooth
not
at
all
bitter
one
i
would
enjoy
any
time
too
bad
its
not
available
in
sixpacks
certainly
recommended
overall
drinkablity
for
me
is
low
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
that
ill
drink
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
one
again
i
felt
slightly
sick
after
drinking
it
and
although
it
could
have
been
from
something
else
i
cant
shake
the
feeling
that
the
scarecrow
here
was
responsible
try
it
you
might
like
it
but
probably
not
end
rant
drinkability
i
love
the
organic
thing
but
there
are
better
beers
for
the
money
drinkability
decent
pale
ale
refreshing
and
crisp
d
i
think
this
beer
had
a
pretty
good
taste
and
is
pretty
smooth
so
i
think
that
it
could
be
a
session
beer
worth
a
try
drinkability
gulpable
d
i
could
have
a
few
but
i
would
probably
get
bored
after
three
or
four
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
a
decent
brew
just
like
the
hobgoblin
ale
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
to
try
something
different
and
because
i
liked
the
label
art
unfortunately
it
wasnt
as
good
as
its
brewbrother
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pale
ales
although
ill
try
them
in
the
hopes
ill
find
one
i
like
but
even
when
compared
to
others
this
one
was
not
very
good
overall
it
was
average
but
it
was
much
to
bitter
with
a
very
odd
after
taste
nice
body
and
flavor
more
characteristic
of
an
esb
then
a
pale
the
head
did
fade
fast
gorgeous
amber
color
that
gets
me
excited
about
the
flavor
and
subtle
hop
nose
nice
stoney
finish
with
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
an
easy
beer
to
drink
in
large
volumes
a
light
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
medium
sized
head
that
dies
and
reasonable
lacing
the
aroma
is
whimpy
of
yeast
pumpkinsquash
the
taste
first
strikes
me
as
watery
and
has
a
grapefruit
introduction
that
is
a
bit
tart
and
bready
but
is
generally
pretty
weak
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
there
is
little
motivation
disappointing
compared
to
wychwoods
other
work
a
light
golden
color
active
carbonation
in
a
short
lasting
head
with
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
about
half
way
through
the
smell
hit
me
as
that
of
low
tide
at
the
beach
really
didnt
care
much
for
this
selection
not
much
personality
unless
you
can
appreciate
a
german
style
pils
with
the
typical
skunkiness
just
not
for
me
overall
a
decent
and
drinkable
english
pa
i
suspect
that
this
one
would
be
quite
nice
to
enjoy
on
cask
overall
another
decent
but
wholly
unremarkable
english
pale
worth
a
try
the
herbal
hop
taste
of
scarcrow
golden
pale
ale
is
probably
its
most
appealing
taste
characteristic
and
this
is
the
flavor
i
kept
noticing
as
i
took
each
sip
the
herbal
taste
comes
in
the
finish
and
it
keeps
you
guessing
it
isnt
like
the
hop
flavor
present
in
most
other
pale
ale
i
e
the
strong
citrus
taste
or
the
strongly
earthy
taste
or
something
else
common
to
this
style
it
is
a
little
different
but
other
than
the
herbs
there
really
isnt
anything
else
great
to
say
about
scarecrow
golden
pale
ale
its
a
very
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
that
is
a
little
too
watery
for
my
tastes
and
too
skunky
d
another
standard
pint
to
have
if
im
overseas
id
probably
reach
for
something
with
more
body
as
this
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
probably
would
be
better
on
draft
in
a
pub
d
not
so
good
it
is
harsh
and
drying
i
am
going
to
struggle
to
get
through
this
pint
it
is
not
something
i
would
want
to
continually
drink
the
pour
revealed
weak
head
with
minimal
lacing
the
color
is
a
straw
yellow
which
is
suited
for
a
beer
called
scarecrow
its
crystal
clear
with
no
sediment
and
bubbling
carbination
aroma
is
of
a
light
malt
thats
not
too
complex
and
a
little
fruity
the
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
that
lingers
it
has
a
light
body
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
watery
it
could
use
more
carbination
its
below
average
in
about
every
catagory
weak
abv
it
should
not
offend
the
lightest
of
beer
drinkers
overall
i
probably
would
not
try
it
again
this
brew
comes
back
in
full
with
its
abundance
of
mellow
flavors
that
carmelize
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
alot
of
earthey
buiscut
flavors
are
evident
i
found
this
ale
to
finish
a
little
dry
in
the
end
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
an
enjoyable
brew
that
i
will
have
again
drinkability
its
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
would
really
reccomend
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
it
it
just
isnt
outstanding
in
anyway
this
easydrinking
organic
brew
is
a
thirstquencher
with
a
refreshing
dryness
in
the
finish
it
makes
for
a
fine
session
ale
this
was
from
a
550
ml
bottle
id
like
to
find
6packs
of
this
one
i
like
this
ale
and
of
the
two
wychwood
beers
ive
sampled
fiddlers
elbow
being
the
other
i
enjoy
this
one
more
d
ive
liked
other
offerings
from
wychwood
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
thank
you
very
much
quite
nice
refreshing
and
satiating
but
not
overfilling
or
abusive
to
the
palate
just
a
great
session
ale
well
worth
trying
easily
drinkable
mellow
mild
satisfying
drinkability
not
bad
but
either
misclassified
or
not
tostyle
in
my
opinion
m
fairly
mediumlight
bodied
and
low
carbonation
drinkability
for
nearly
3
50
i
dont
really
recommend
this
beer
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
english
pale
ales
though
so
its
ether
a
hit
or
miss
hear
for
you
i
do
believe
that
it
will
get
a
little
more
recognition
now
that
it
is
not
in
the
clear
bottle
and
in
the
brown
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
slightly
fruity
smell
that
had
a
hint
of
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
bitter
and
high
in
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
some
carbonation
made
it
interesting
but
nothing
outstanding
the
drinkability
was
fair
but
a
bit
bitter
for
long
sessions
notes
one
and
done
another
english
pale
that
is
completely
unimpressive
and
boring
the
only
thing
of
interest
was
the
smell
but
it
ends
there
as
not
much
from
the
nose
comes
through
when
the
rubber
hits
the
road
oh
and
the
bottles
that
ive
seen
around
are
now
brown
and
they
are
advertising
this
brew
as
organic
neato
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
it
drinks
pretty
well
with
the
light
body
and
mild
flavor
but
there
isnt
much
to
make
you
go
wow
i
really
want
to
have
another
one
of
those
it
is
not
bad
so
dont
get
me
wrong
there
just
isnt
all
that
much
going
for
this
beer
i
would
recommend
any
number
of
epas
over
this
one
unusual
aromataste
they
seem
to
contradict
each
other
the
weak
body
dooms
this
brew
oh
well
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
golden
orange
color
and
thick
white
head
that
turned
into
good
lacing
unfortunately
the
appearance
was
the
high
point
aroma
at
first
was
floral
and
grassy
hops
however
the
mmore
of
the
beer
i
had
the
less
aroma
there
was
never
did
taste
the
maltiness
they
describe
and
the
flavor
was
really
devoid
of
much
taste
finish
was
dry
and
metallic
and
forutnately
diminished
very
quickly
cute
name
and
label
not
much
to
say
about
the
beer
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
now
dark
brown
earlier
reviews
mention
old
clear
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
had
a
golden
color
with
decent
head
and
tons
of
carbonation
really
didnt
have
much
of
a
smell
little
hoppy
the
taste
was
very
bland
and
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
unless
i
had
a
bad
sample
this
is
not
worth
having
again
or
recommending
2
na
ml
n
this
turned
out
not
to
be
as
bad
as
anticipated
but
thats
not
saying
much
would
i
ever
try
it
again
probably
not
from
the
label
organic
imported
golden
pale
ale
scarecrow
ale
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
from
a
clear
bottle
which
oddly
enough
did
not
appear
to
have
an
easily
discernible
size
marked
on
it
light
for
the
style
nothing
particularly
exciting
just
kind
of
average
worth
a
try
decent
but
predictable
beer
typicall
english
in
a
very
sweet
heavy
malt
kinda
way
held
away
from
cloying
by
hop
flavor
herbally
hops
show
modestly
in
the
aroma
but
round
out
the
flavor
hops
add
very
little
bittering
to
the
bigger
malt
base
ripe
fruits
and
a
light
vegetal
flavor
emerge
near
the
finish
a
little
slick
on
the
toung
buttery
its
worth
drinking
but
im
getting
bored
with
a
lot
of
these
english
brews
light
refreshing
but
a
little
weak
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
but
tough
to
appreciate
i
tried
this
one
from
a
bottle
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
head
that
is
quick
to
disappear
i
noted
a
little
honey
with
maybe
some
grapefruit
in
the
nose
the
feeling
on
the
palate
was
okay
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
yet
this
is
balanced
and
refreshing
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
one
but
nothing
awful
just
average
ss
this
was
alright
it
is
usda
certified
organic
which
is
good
if
youre
into
that
bottom
line
i
like
a
lot
of
uk
brews
and
appreciate
the
fact
that
they
can
make
a
flavourful
beer
with
rather
low
abv
s
but
this
is
one
that
i
wont
make
a
habit
of
buying
ill
blame
the
hops
had
this
at
a
beer
and
cheese
tasting
it
was
paired
with
lord
of
the
hundreds
sussex
raw
ewes
milk
cheese
decent
enough
beer
with
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
not
a
whole
lot
of
malt
in
the
aroma
or
the
taste
nothing
really
makes
this
stand
out
as
an
esb
my
gold
standard
for
this
style
is
fullers
esb
on
cask
in
london
overall
what
possessed
me
to
event
think
this
would
be
worth
a
try
well
i
guess
i
was
fooled
by
the
brown
bottle
it
just
goes
to
show
that
not
all
crap
skunky
beer
comes
in
clear
glass
bottles
a
big
miss
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
clear
glass
halfliter
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
this
is
one
of
the
last
beers
i
need
to
try
before
finishing
a
beer
club
at
a
local
beerfly
place
i
thought
this
may
be
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
but
i
was
wrong
light
golden
color
no
head
almost
like
a
macro
lager
with
just
a
little
bit
more
hopes
to
it
cool
bottle
but
thats
about
all
drinkability
if
it
were
a
warmer
day
this
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
but
i
think
the
lemony
sweetness
would
get
old
after
a
few
of
them
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
from
a
unique
and
attractive
bottle
though
the
bottle
is
clear
why
would
they
bottle
in
a
clear
container
i
ask
myself
appears
as
a
yellow
color
with
a
mediocre
head
and
considerable
lacing
smells
more
hoppy
than
malty
tastes
of
unidentifyable
hops
with
a
malt
accent
a
bit
watery
and
a
poor
metallic
taste
flat
not
in
carbonation
but
in
taste
really
quite
dry
and
light
in
body
i
didnt
really
think
much
of
this
one
to
be
forthright
its
ok
at
best
and
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
nothin
horrible
here
but
nothing
good
either
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
touch
of
haze
and
fluffy
white
head
did
not
have
much
of
a
scent
mostly
a
very
faint
delicate
hops
aroma
taste
was
very
bland
and
did
not
have
much
complexity
slightly
dry
on
the
tongue
with
not
much
else
going
on
nothing
in
this
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
but
it
is
harmless
enough
that
it
does
not
completely
turn
you
off
from
drinking
it
pours
a
slightly
hazed
dark
gold
soapy
one
finger
head
will
fizzle
out
and
leave
little
to
no
lace
weak
scent
of
ester
and
corn
but
not
much
malt
or
hops
sweet
pale
malt
and
wheat
flavor
upfront
with
ester
and
butterscotch
in
the
back
aftertaste
is
a
touch
dry
with
a
decenlt
balanced
tealike
hops
thin
body
and
low
carbonation
are
smooth
but
the
drinkability
is
tainted
by
the
diacetyl
that
sets
in
the
finish
a
slick
mouthfeel
may
be
appropriate
for
the
style
but
its
still
a
bit
pricey
for
overall
quality
a
thankful
gift
to
me
that
i
would
consider
a
nice
summer
refresher
for
the
light
lager
crowd
a
little
too
simple
for
my
taste
thats
all
body
barely
above
light
with
a
coarse
grainy
mouthfeel
and
a
thin
watery
texture
a
definate
drainpour
deja
vu
drinkability
just
not
that
good
i
didnt
really
come
away
from
the
experience
with
much
in
the
way
of
good
memories
just
a
wish
i
had
spent
my
money
on
something
else
cheers2beers
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
and
has
a
nice
white
head
there
is
not
much
to
speak
of
on
the
nose
but
a
faint
floral
hoppiness
can
be
found
its
flavor
is
very
subtle
the
malt
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
has
a
nice
hoppiness
that
is
not
overwhelming
in
line
with
most
bpas
not
a
fuller
or
youngs
but
better
than
a
bass
either
way
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
2

a
bottle
is
a
bit
of
a
deterrent
for
any
pale
ale
another
exceptionally
poor
showing
from
wychwood
i
intentionally
stayed
away
from
all
wychwood
products
after
hobgoblin
until
they
jettisoned
the
clear
glass
in
favor
of
brown
when
protected
from
uv
light
these
guys
brew
decent
beer
scarecrow
ale
the
north
american
name
for
circle
master
may
not
be
stupendous
but
its
a
worthwhile
english
pale
ale
and
is
a
beer
that
i
just
might
pick
up
again
medium
bodied
decently
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
the
sourness
medium
to
light
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
pretty
run
of
the
mill
english
ale
maybe
slightly
above
average
i
prefer
others
but
this
is
not
bad
at
all
perhaps
would
function
well
as
a
crossover
beer
the
taste
was
citrusy
and
pungent
but
more
subtle
very
light
i
imagine
this
would
be
lovely
with
a
light
cheese
or
other
light
foods
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
light
refreshing
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
except
i
can
see
the
sourness
getting
to
you
after
a
while
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
way
more
than
i
thought
i
would
considering
the
previous
reviews
maybe
they
had
bad
bottles
oh
well
i
enjoyed
it
dont
let
the
scarecrow
scare
you
away
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasanta
nd
this
is
one
that
goes
down
nice
and
easy
not
bad
overall
impression
be
afraid
be
very
afraid
the
transit
from
england
hasnt
been
pretty
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
fairly
good
epa
that
had
been
slowly
destroyed
by
light
leaving
it
to
be
a
skunked
heap

well
carbonated
with
a
light
taste
and
mouthfeel
has
a
lingering
skunky
taste
to
it
and
a
bit
spicy

noticeable
from

the

is
way
overhyped
this
does
seem
to
be
a
light
issue
here
body
is
shy

the
carbonation
is
actually
pretty
well
done
for
the
abv
hops
and
malt
strike
a
decent
if
unremarkable
balance
honeyish
but
the
skunkiness
turns
an
initially
average
flavor
into
something
that
reminds
me
of
milkweed
to
try
to
reconstruct
this
brew
in
its
original
sense
isnt
a
big
deal
smooth
and
with
a
bitters
balance
but
probably
really
pedestrian
i
took
a
few
sips
just
to
have
an
idea
of
what
it
tasted
like
simple
slightly
malty
not
much
to
get
exited
about
might
have
been
much
more
drinkable
in
a
brown
bottle

down
the
drain
skip
this
one
ive
had
this
beer
at
a
tasting
fresh
out
of
sealed
boxes
never
exposed
to
light
and
that
was
a
different
experience
than
what
i
have
in
front
of
me
the
first
thing
to
realize
about
this
beer
is
that
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
so
anything
on
the
shelf
for
any
amount
of
time
is
going
to
be
tarnished
with
the
exposure
to
light
after
taking
off
the
cap
the
first
scent
i
get
is
the
typical
skunkygrolschy
smell
i
associate
with
a
beer
gone
bad
the
beer
is
a
pretty
light
golden
yellow
color
without
much
of
a
head
even
after
trying
to
make
it
happen
the
nose
besides
the
skunk
has
some
sweet
malts
hiding
along
with
a
metallic
smell
not
what
i
want
in
a
beer
of
any
type
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
smell
though
there
is
a
metallic
tinge
that
detracts
there
is
a
nice
sweet
start
and
hops
that
dance
on
my
tonge
after
swallowing
the
beer
not
a
bad
offering
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
the
drinkability
is
not
as
high
as
i
would
expect
from
a
nice
light
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
can
find
this
on
tap
or
fresh
out
of
a
box
again
but
that
is
the
only
way
i
would
want
to
resample
this
baby
looks
better
than
it
tastes
but
not
by
much
it
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
with
just
a
trace
of
head
and
some
lace
though
marginal
aromas
hint
of
sticky
sweet
hop
and
mild
malt
with
a
kiss
of
skunk
for
good
measure
in
the
mouth
the
beer
provides
the
taster
more
sticky
sweet
hop
flavors
and
an
underlying
flavor
of
fennellicorice
the
beer
finishes
in
an
uninspiring
cloying
fashion
i
wont
bother
finishing
this
one
ill
save
the
belly
space
beer
is
good
happy
beering
poured
out
with
no
head
teensy
bit
of
large
bubbles
on
the
side
only
a
little
cloudy
the
color
of
apple
juice
smells
intensely
like
styrian
hops
to
speak
nicely
smells
skunky
to
not
speak
nicely
taste
of
very
earthy
tones
the
styrian
hop
flavor
is
just
too
intense
in
this
brew
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
them
so
maybe
i
just
cant
get
over
that
drinkable
but
not
really
good
to
drink
i
cant
recommend
that
you
buy
this
stuff
on
the
whole
this
was
a
disappointment
it
is
a
yellow
golden
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
it
is
hust
average
to
look
at
and
it
doesn
ot
get
any
better
from
there
the
aroma
is
not
strong
but
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
lemon
iced
tea
the
maltiness
is
not
extensive
which
is
good
because
it
is
no
too
hoppy
it
is
well
balanced
but
lacks
depth
and
complexity
it
is
refreshing
but
there
are
many
better
english
pale
ales
available
scarecrow
ale
was
a
light
gold
color
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
unremarkable
the
taste
was
undistinguished
mostly
grainy
with
some
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
citrus
carbonation
was
good
but
the
overall
mouth
feel
was
not
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
to
me
this
beer
seemed
to
be
more
like
a
pilsner
than
a
golden
ale
best
points
were
the
use
of
organically
grown
hops
and
malt
and
the
label
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
and
sinks
back
within
a
minute
or
so
to
form
a
lazy
lace
on
the
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
earth
robust
hops
bit
of
pale
malts
hiding
back
ther
as
well
bitter
astringency
dominates
the
taste
the
hops
are
predominant
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
taste
right
it
gets
more
drinkable
after
every
sip
though
and
sweet
honey
flavors
step
through
once
your
taste
buds
adjust
by
the
third
sip
you
think
it
isnt
so
bad
just
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
would
not
make
a
bad
session
beer
but
would
not
make
a
good
one
either
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
bottle
and
label
are
certainly
the
high
points
of
this
ale
the
appearance
wasnt
bad
golden
thick
head
big
bubbles
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
lacing
was
scant
and
also
disappeared
the
smell
was
hops
and
skunk
with
the
skunk
being
more
prevalent
not
to
my
liking
at
all
the
taste
was
a
bit
hoppy
grains
and
wateryalcolhol
but
i
still
couldnt
get
over
the
skunk
aroma
enough
to
try
to
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
also
drinkability
was
hampered
by
the
bad
smell
and
so
so
taste
i
dont
know
if
the
skunked
aroma
was
inherent
to
the
product
or
if
i
happened
to
get
a
bad
bottle
if
it
was
the
latter
than
i
would
say
this
beer
wasnt
horrible
just
nothing
great
barely
a
step
above
domestic
macros
if
however
it
wasnt
a
bad
bottle
and
that
skunkiness
is
normal
then
its
a
whole
different
ball
game
hohum
yawn
im
quite
disappointed
with
this
one
since
id
loved
robbeers
hobgoblin
shirt
whats
the
matter
lagerboy
afraid
you
might
taste
something
and
thats
why
i
purchased
this
one
but
i
just
cant
recommend
it
not
good
and
one
i
wont
have
again
sorry
but
looks
are
deceiving
youll
buy
the
beer
because
it
looks
cool
but
after
you
start
drinking
it
youll
realise
its
not
that
good
pat
this
one
pours
a
yellow
color
and
has
a
decent
sized
white
head
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
not
too
exciting
just
malts
and
some
yeast
the
flavor
was
slightly
skunky
possibly
due
to
the
clear
bottle
mostly
the
flavor
was
comprised
of
pale
malts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
but
not
much
else
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
but
i
might
try
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
the
fact
that
this
is
an
organic
ale
and
definitely
lightstuck
does
nothing
for
me
its
worth
a
try
i
suppose
but
something
i
would
not
purchase
regularly
sinkability

this
british
skunkorama
is
dedicated
to
the
porcelain
gods
not
impressive
this
organic
ale
pours
a
shiny
gold
a
nice
white
head
of
various
sized
bubbles
lasts
a
fairly
long
time
and
leaves
a
thinrimmed
coating
and
a
good
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
is
mostly
a
doughy
malt
with
a
fair
amount
of
hops
being
that
this
ale
is
bottled
in
clear
glass
i
expect
it
would
have
become
skunky
had
i
stored
it
a
bit
longer
a
lightly
sweet
malt
blends
well
with
tealike
and
citrusy
hops
a
faint
taste
of
pears
can
be
detected
i
like
this
beer
but
because
theres
no
freshness
date
ill
only
buy
it
from
reputable
packies
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
simple
pale
malts
and
yeast
the
taste
is
much
the
same
very
plain
no
malt
character
bitter
and
quite
dry
the
mouthfeel
sucks
its
a
light
bodied
beer
but
the
carbonation
is
way
too
low
this
was
a
hard
drink
one
and
done
for
me
i
could
have
a
dozen
of
these
eminently
drinkable
ill
also
note
and
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
think
they
just
changed
the
bottling
of
these
beers
to
a
smoother
more
rounded
bottle
but
its
still
clearmaybe
they
didnt
get
the
memo
this
beer
would
get
higher
ratings
if
people
were
able
to
sample
fresher
bottles
its
to
bad
i
had
to
give
this
a
bad
ratingi
love
to
get
the
hard
to
find
english
ales
anyways
this
poured
a
sort
of
gold
color
with
a
light
head
that
did
leave
some
lacingthe
aroma
was
a
little
skunky
damn
clear
bottles
and
musty
the
taste
was
a
little
skunky
as
well
but
i
did
pick
up
some
slight
maltiness
to
it
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
or
in
its
home
country
iam
sure
it
would
be
better
scarecrow
poured
to
a
rather
nice
pale
yellow
but
no
head
to
be
seen
or
any
belgian
lace
nice
clarity
though
i
must
have
gotton
a
good
batch
because
i
did
not
detect
a
hint
of
skunkiness
overall
a
rather
average
ale
with
a
cool
label
worth
a
try
if
you
find
pours
with
a
medium
white
head
that
leaves
no
lace
despite
reading
other
reviews
that
this
was
skunkiest
brew
on
the
planet
i
got
a
good
batch
without
a
trace
of
skunkiness
clear
golden
color
with
carbonation
that
gradually
dies
crisp
clean
finish
after
a
hoppymalt
start
light
medium
bodied
this
is
ok
and
id
rather
drink
it
than
something
i
know
had
tons
of
chemicals
in
it
this
is
apparently
an
organic
brew
but
this
isnt
something
id
choose
to
buy
again
very
unimpressive
ale
cool
bottle
design
but
thats
about
it
there
was
some
definite
skunkiness
damn
clear
bottles
it
wasnt
unbearable
so
maybe
i
bought
it
just
in
time
before
horribleness
set
in
bitterness
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
taste
and
aftertaste
its
nicely
refreshing
in
a
way
no
excitement
here
im
staying
away
from
clear
bottles
unless
its
sam
smiths
another
clear
bottle
import
ruined
by
skunky
smell
another
3
50
down
the
drain
another
cool
bottle
concept
wasted
this
beer
probably
would
not
be
bad
otherwise
as
it
did
have
some
hops
flavor
i
dont
know
when
some
of
these
importers
will
realize
they
are
shooting
themselves
in
the
foot
with
these
clear
bottles
this
is
certainly
the
least
impressive
brew
ive
had
from
wychwood
pours
a
slightly
chalky
washedout
orange
color
with
very
faint
traces
of
carbonation
virtually
no
head
just
a
faint
bit
of
lace
floating
on
the
top
smell
is
hoppy
earthy
and
herbal
with
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
is
not
bad
at
all
but
its
far
from
being
impressive
hoppy
flavor
earthy
and
herbal
like
the
aroma
nice
refreshing
bitterness
weak
malt
flavor
here
though
body
is
a
bit
watery
but
otherwise
scarecrow
has
a
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
notes
an
all
around
ok
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
but
does
not
impress
at
all
its
lack
of
head
and
dull
malt
flavours
made
me
a
bit
withdrawn
from
the
brew
not
bad
just
lackluster
great
name
because
after
opening
this
beer
and
tasting
it
i
was
scared
off
terrible
skunky
aroma
or
shall
i
say
smell
the
taste
was
very
bland
and
no
characteristics
also
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
dont
drink
this
beer
cheers
scarecrow
was
exactly
how
i
felt
when
i
took
my
first
sip
in
fact
thats
how
i
felt
after
the
second
and
third
sip
the
bitter
taste
was
so
over
powering
that
i
couldnt
make
it
go
down
the
fourth
time
and
threw
it
down
the
drain
on
one
of
my
worst
list
easy
drinking
ale
amber
color
and
slightly
bitter
like
a
true
english
ale
overallrun
of
the
mill
ale
to
me
i
love
the
packaging
but
that
was
the
best
part
of
the
experience
o
my
introduction
to
ipswich
and
im
very
much
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
three
in
the
variety
pack
great
stuff
reminds
me
a
bit
of
brooklyn
pennant
ale
o
i
hate
to
be
so
blunt
but
this
beer
sucked
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
theres
a
lot
of
cleaning
up
to
be
done
here
o
if
i
had
to
compare
this
to
something
it
would
be
more
finest
kind
then
whales
tale
pale
ale
the
appearance
in
particular
was
well
out
of
the
norm
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
varieties
from
ipswich
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
other
three
from
the
variety
twelvepack
a
great
value
by
the
way
since
i
paid
only
11
for
the
twelver
when
it
was
on
sale
a
helluva
buy
for
92
cents
a
bottle
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
when
i
was
first
getting
into
beer
years
later
its
actually
a
bit
different
than
i
remember
its
way
more
complex
and
its
very
unique
from
my
experience
this
is
actually
best
on
tap
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out

nothing
really
memorable
however
mouthfeeloverall
light

plenty

very
nice
overall
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
but
its
a
decent
example
worth
a
shot
this
beer
doesnt
match
the
others
ive
had
in
this
category
so
definitely
worth
a
visit
the
beer
was
served
in
12oz
pint
glass
and
appeared
a
nice
bright
and
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
slightly
offwhite
foamy
head
that
was
well
retained
that
ultimately
settled
into
a
thin
cap
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
as
expected
from
the
style
with
some
hop
presence
but
the
aroma
is
pretty
well
balanced
again
as
expected
for
the
style
the
taste
follows
the
nose
well
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
some
earthy
hops
the
combination
worked
very
well
together
the
beer
had
a
nice
feel
to
it
and
was
exceptionally
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
taste
is
dry
bittersweet
character
with
nuttycaramelly
toasty

pepperywoody
hop
bitterness
it
has
light
juicy
zesty

it
is
very
good
with
nicely

pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
an
average
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
and
a
little
yeasty
promising
if
not
outstanding
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
some
fruit
and
a
hoppybitter
undertone
not
too
shabby
smooth
texture
has
about
average
body
and
fizz
overall
fair
to
middlin
superbly
drinkable
light
to
medium
body
with
very
good
carbonation
in
general
this
is
not
my
type
of
pale
ale
i
like
the
bolder
american
variety
and
if
i
want
more
malt
ill
go
for
a
kolsch
or
a
munich
helles
definitely
good
stuff
for
the
price
though
o
great
session
beer
the
toasted
malt
flavor
was
excellent
and
this
ale
was
very
smooth
i
liked
it
slightly
more
than
the
dpa
overall
this
beer
fits
well
with
the
epa
style
will
have
more
in
the
future
overall
this
beer
fits
the
english
style
pale
ale
style
very
well
the
beer
had
a
very
inviting
appearance
attractive
smell
and
full
flavor
all
properties
of
this
brew
seemed
to
work
together
very
well
poured
from
a
cask
and
served
in
a
20
oz
tumbler
the
beer
is
a
hazy
unfiltered
honeybrown
coloring
with
a
dense
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
of
about
an
inch
aromas
are
a
nice
subtle
blend
of
citrus
and
hops
on
a
sweet
toffee
backbone
flavors
have
a
good
roasted
quality
to
them
with
a
resiny
and
bitter
hopping
that
balances
the
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
from
the
malt
profiles
citrus
influence
is
light
with
a
lemon
zest
flavor
peeking
out
here
and
there
good
use
of
wet
hops
to
clean
the
palate
and
impart
some
strong
peppery
characters
without
being
overly
bitter
the
beer
leaves
a
decent
lacing
along
the
glass
and
the
body
is
smooth
and
light
the
lack
of
carbonation
from
the
cask
permits
all
the
flavors
to
truly
blend
together
the
aftertaste
is
tangy
and
bitter
hops
with
a
slight
drying
finish
decent
brew
overall
this
was
a
good
ale
fairly
wellbalanced
with
good
flavor
and
very
easy
to
drink
doesnt
push
boundaries
or
blow
my
mind
but
my
guess
is
thats
not
the
intent
solid
beer
overall
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
makes
a
great
seesion
beer
the
balance
of
base
ingredients
and
adjuncts
is
outstanding
has
never
failed
to
satisfy
mercury
knows
its
try
their
oatmeal
stout
overall
simple
and
easygoing
but
pleasant
overall
refreshing
poured
a
1
offwhite
head
body
is
an
interesting
raw
sienna
yellow
color
with
a
slight
haze
smells
of
malt
and
caramel
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
smell
its
more
standard
bmc
with
a
little
malt
and
definitely
more
bitter
hops
coming
through
in
the
finish
its
ok
i
just
dont
think
it
stands
out
much
higher
than
upper
average
reminds
me
alot
of
berkshires
english
ipas
but
with
a
big
emphasis
on
the
malts
not
much
to
it
but
a
good
authentic
english
ale
from
the
states
d
this
one
is
excellent
lower
abv
for
huge
flavor
simply
great
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
of
all
parts
of
the
us
it
seems
the
new
england
breweries
mimic
british
styles
the
best
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
this
is
a
crisp
yummy
beer
that
allows
you
to
imagine
yourself
sitting
on
the
cape
and
sipping
away
while
your
thoughts
float
to
brisk
summer
days
okay
enough
imagery
this
ale
is
surprisingly
refreshing
pours
a
little
light
without
much
head
but
makes
up
for
appearance
in
taste
overall
this
is
a
lovely
pale
ale
being
largely
wellbalanced
with
a
slight
emphasis
on
a
citrus
tang
the
brew
doesnt
necessarily
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
for
the
style
but
it
does
prove
an
excellent
example
of
it
and
is
worth
a
taste
slight
amount
of
haze
in
an
brownish
orange
almost
no
head
just
a
small
puddle
floating
around
nose
contains
a
lot
of
malty
bread
some
small
amounts
of
toast
fruity
hop
character
the
balance
between
rich
malty
bread
and
fruity
hops
seems
off
a
large
amount
of
malt
and
toasty
bread
with
some
slight
hop
character
hops
were
present
more
in
the
nose
bready
malts
transition
to
a
metallic
tang
and
some
bitterness
that
cloys
at
the
back
of
your
throat
scratchy
and
tangy
bitter
old
fruits
odhave
always
loved
ipswich
ipa
i
may
like
this
one
a
bit
more
it
is
definitely
a
more
apt
12
pack
beer
than
the
ipa
the
mild
yet
attractive
flavor
makes
you
yearn
for
another
bottle
i
think
this
might
be
my
goto
12pack
brew
when
im
not
feeling
like
burning
the
enamel
off
my
teeth
with
some
good
ol
finest
kind
by
smuttynose
sessionable
local
and
pretty
damn
addictive
not
bad
mercury
brew
co
really
like
this
beer
and
it
doesnt
break
the
bank
overall
a
delightful
beer
true
to
style
the
food
pairings
are
endless
pours
amnce
two
fingers
worth
of
creamy
white
head
crystal
clear
pale
golden
color
the
most
sticky
lacing
ive
seen
in
a
while
remains
half
way
through
the
glass
smells
slightly
floral
and
some
carmel
malts
maybe
some
bready
yeast
tastes
sweetcarmel
earthy
hops
medium
bitterness
to
balance
it
light
body
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
neutral
and
watery
tasting
overall
this
is
lackluster
to
me
o
session
forever
should
go
great
with
most
redmeat
or
fowl
meals
probably
even
nice
with
pasta
im
glad
ive
got
a
sixtel
of
this
in
the
bar
room
an
assertive
bitterness
from
earthy
hops
jumps
to
the
front
of
the
palate
it
is
followed
by
some
impressive
fruitiness
toasty
malts
and
then
a
wellrounded
caramel
character
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
it
really
is
pleasant
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
one
of
my
more
favorite
englishstyle
offerings
and
if
there
are
more
like
this
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
more
m
lively
carbonation
dry
and
crisp
drinkability
i
would
have
no
problem
purchasing
this
beer
again
in
the
future
nor
will
i
have
any
difficulty
in
finishing
the
rest
of
the
supply
i
have
now
a
very
nice
beer
overall
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
but
is
a
full
medium
body
with
lots
to
think
about
there
is
a
smoothness
that
engulfs
this
beer
as
it
goes
down
and
then
smack
of
the
hops
its
like
sliding
down
a
slide
and
hitting
the
flat
end
drinkability
is
ok
crisp
and
clean
enough
with
a
low
enough
abv
for
multiple
pints
but
the
flavors
arent
really
interesting
enough
to
stop
you
from
reaching
for
something
else
very
good
drinkability
i
wouldnt
turn
another
one
down
also
if
you
like
this
beer
i
implore
you
give
the
goose
island
honker
a
shot
delicious
in
very
similar
ways
d
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
english
pale
that
is
worth
sitting
with
for
a
while
grapefruit
citrus
hop
flavor
particularly
at
the
finish
sufficient
sweetness
to
keep
up
with
the
hops
but
actually
a
dry
finish
hop
flavor
is
robust
but
bitterness
subdued
a
very
complete
flavor
profile
with
a
nice
easy
mouthfeel
im
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
not
something
id
buy
again
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
one
down
i
whole
heartedly
agree
with
the
bros
this
ale
is
world
class
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
appropriate
for
style
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
with
this
going
down
very
easily
very
satisfying
i
want
to
have
another
go
at
this
one
under
better
conditions
maybe
if
i
had
sat
at
the
bah
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
for
sure
never
heard
much
about
this
brewery
even
though
it
is
right
up
the
road
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
for
sure
especially
for
any
winter
time
gettogethers
drinks
well
nothing
wows
me
but
its
a
solid
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
fluffy
head
a
waft
of
hops
floats
from
the
glass
and
the
aroma
is
clean
and
bready
with
a
nice
hop
floweriness
the
flavor
has
very
light
caramel
and
a
cloverlike
floweriness
and
some
honey
the
finish
however
is
thin
and
suggests
an
extract
brew
there
is
a
tight
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
clingy
and
aspriny
dry
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
dull
burnt
orange
with
a
frothy
two
inch
offwhite
head
that
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
half
inch
cap
some
strands
of
lacing
but
no
legs
nose
reveals
toasted
malt
a
slightly
nutty
quality
and
a
little
bit
of
citrus
towards
the
back
characteristics
in
the
nose
also
present
in
the
flavor
profile
however
a
bit
watered
down
also
the
slightest
suggestion
of
bittering
hops
expresses
itself
lightly
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
light
carbonation
simple
and
quaffable
a
pretty
solid
english
pale
ale
i
bet
this
would
be
excellent
on
cask
d
a
great
english
pale
and
easy
to
turn
it
into
as
session
at
5
4
abv
amidst
the
sea
of
english
pales
on
the
american
market
this
one
honestly
stands
out
and
would
replace
the
otter
creeks
and
some
of
the
berkshire
offerings
we
see
here
in
ct
as
a
regular
fix
notes
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
to
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
year
one
of
the
more
underated
beers
cheers
medium
bodied
and
above
average
carbonation
the
flavor
makes
the
beer
sweet
malts
with
hint
of
toastyness
citrus
hops
come
through
nicely
and
perfectly
balance
this
pale
ale
finishes
a
little
dry
bigger
flavor
than
most
in
this
style
well
balanced
refreshing
and
drinkable
cheers
very
nice
im
surprised
i
havent
noticed
before
that
this
really
is
a
nice
brew
this
is
another
winner
from
ipswich
i
am
so
glad
i
picked
up
the
variety
pack
if
you
see
this
grab
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
plentiful
around
where
i
live
but
really
good
stuff
i
could
get
into
this
anytime
but
with
summer
just
around
the
corner
i
am
thinking
that
this
will
make
its
way
with
me
on
vacation
nice
pour
dark
brownamber
small
amount
of
foam
tasted
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
but
less
hoppy
and
darker
i
liked
it
for
a
change
of
pace
has
a
nice
tangy
bite
to
it
but
not
over
the
top
rich
but
not
anything
close
to
a
porter
overall
satisfying
probably
best
for
a
fall
beer
in
early
september
i
think
i
will
get
a
twelver
full
bodyflavored
hit
it
right
on
the
head
dont
need
to
change
a
thing
overall
id
consider
this
a
fantastic
ale
maybe
a
little
heavy
for
a
true
session
brew
but
definitely
a
good
addition
to
the
opening
lineup
d
quite
drinkable
this
beer
displays
all
of
the
hallmarks
of
its
style
especially
with
its
rich
malt
flavor
and
strong
hoppy
finish
the
sharp
chalky
bitterness
and
mustyspicy
hop
flavors
are
particularly
well
done
it
is
very
sessionable
and
i
imagine
it
would
be
particularly
nice
on
cask
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
there
is
lots
of
carbonation
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
without
seeking
out
a
new
flavor
for
my
palate
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
murky
orangishbrown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wet
grass
with
some
citrus
the
flavor
is
grass
citrus
iced
tea
and
medium
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
an
enjoyable
english
ipa
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
the
malt
and
hops
are
in
perfect
balance
for
me
im
not
too
much
of
a
hophead
ipswich
ipa
is
actually
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
and
its
really
nice
to
have
such
a
smooth
drinking
pale
ale
that
doesnt
overpower
with
sweetness
or
bitterness
i
think
mercury
brewing
company
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
brew
the
perfect
goto
beer
for
any
weekend
when
you
want
a
smooth
drinking
flavorful
full
bodied
craft
beer
that
doesnt
wear
you
out
after
one
or
two
drinks
poured
ambercopper
into
a
pint
glass
with
one
finger
of
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
smelled
very
malty
caramelish
and
earthy
surprisingly
not
much
fruitiness
to
speak
of
however
the
taste
was
in
fact
more
revealing
malty
sweetness
gives
way
to
appleplum
and
then
to
a
fairly
balanced
finish
the
beer
did
maintain
good
flavor
as
it
warmed
to
room
temperature
the
mouthfeel
was
fuller
than
expected
with
the
head
imparting
a
little
creaminess
drinkability
was
certainly
apparent
but
it
may
have
been
just
a
tad
on
the
thick
side
for
me
to
session
more
than
a
couple
of
pints
i
had
this
one
on
tap
at
an
applebees
restaurant
on
january
20
2010
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
looking
ambercopper
with
about
a
finger
of
longlasting
foamy
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
malty
with
a
dash
of
swet
caramel
and
toffee
in
the
mix
the
body
is
in
the
medium
range
with
a
taste
that
draws
out
the
hops
in
a
subtle
but
pleasing
way
it
ends
dry
it
was
nice
to
have
this
available
at
a
chain
restaurant
this
beer
is
great
do
not
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
have
it
very
drinkable
refreshing
but
not
filling
altogether
what
i
consider
a
polite
pale
ale
using
bitter
hops
and
pretty
flavorful
honey
malts
but
subdued
and
unobtrusive
figured
id
try
a
different
local
brew
while
im
visiting
boston
and
it
was
a
good
move
in
my
opinion
got
to
try
a
few
other
from
this
brewery
later
overall
very
delicious
excellent
sweet
malt
profile
very
nice
hop
character
very
very
drinkable
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
white
head
reduces
pretty
quickly
really
no
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
of
mild
hops
moderate
malt
and
some
citrus
with
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
very
dry
and
smooth
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
extremely
pleasing
on
the
palate
took
me
a
while
to
drink
because
i
was
busy
stuffing
my
face
with
breakfast
and
the
beer
was
allowed
time
to
warm
and
still
tasted
great
warm
sign
of
a
good
ale
paired
very
well
with
my
french
toast
bacon
and
sausage
late
night
breakfast
d
nice
beer
this
is
a
good
ale
and
fairly
complex
and
does
have
good
character
could
do
2
of
these
easily
m
and
d
somewhat
aggressive
carbonation
but
a
nice
medium
body
make
this
pleasant
to
drink
botmc
the
gift
that
keeps
giving
this
brew
smells
like
a
earthy
ale
a
slight
molasses
smell
with
earthy
hop
undertones
pours
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
nice
foamy
two
finger
head
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
orange
bronze
head
stands
nicely
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
caramel
hops
kick
in
quickly
with
citrusy
grapefruity
flavor
and
a
sharp
bite
balanced
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
very
good
good
fizz
but
not
overpowering
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
empties
this
is
a
staple
brew
very
good
and
a
sessioner
without
a
doubt
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
mixed
12
pack
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
none
the
less
i
knew
right
when
i
tasted
this
is
was
an
english
pale
ale
just
has
that
sort
of
fruity
taste
to
it
and
isnt
as
hop
forward
and
bitter
as
the
americanized
version
of
the
style
nothing
off
putting
just
not
my
particular
sort
of
taste
definitely
still
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
session
beer
but
the
other
beers
in
the
mixed
pack
are
just
really
good
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
very
slight
hop
note
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slightly
bitter
with
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
little
brew
thanks
chuck
d
rich
complex
malt
flavor
but
easy
drinkability
very
flavorful
and
exciting
to
have
such
a
wonderful
drinking
ale
it
is
refreshing
as
well
and
will
satisfy
those
who
are
more
of
a
maltster
it
is
worth
seeking
this
one
out
nice
nose
a
tight
dryish
malt
package
surrounded
by
a
strong
echo
of
whiskey
and
a
general
booziness
that
makes
you
pay
attention
powerful
yet
cleanly
built
these
big
notes
dont
correlate
completely
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
slight
watery
on
the
edges
the
carbonation
though
is
a
great
asset
as
the
beer
opens
with
some
clean
metallic
notes
dry
biscuit
maltiness
then
recedes
into
a
softer
floral
hop
presence
that
swims
throughout
the
finish
just
a
hint
of
filmy
earthiness
lingers
on
the
top
of
my
mouth
to
remind
me
of
the
style
i
find
this
highly
drinkable
and
a
well
packaged
version
of
the
classic
ipa
dont
drink
and
review
medium
amber
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
from
loose
sediment
a
thin
beige
cap
appeared
after
the
pour
a
combination
of
fine
and
soapy
bubbles
sticky
lace
good
head
retention
light
citrus
aroma

and
tangerine
with
some
caramel

mostly
caramel
with
a
bit

light
bodied
average
carbonation
slight
dryness
nice
texture
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
final
thoughts
it
starts
with
lots
of
malts
and
finishes
with
some
light
hops
the
malts
are
done
very
well
as
it
seems
to
layer
and
has
a
lot
of
earthiness
the
light
hops
tease
you
on
the
finish
almost
as
if
it
wants
to
get
very
hoppy
but
doesnt
this
is
very
drinkable
and
has
a
lot
of
character
reminds
me
of
when
i
first
had
it
years
ago
and
loved
it
back
then
even
though
my
tastes
have
changed
this
seems
to
have
stayed
very
tasty
this
is
one
superb
ale
balance
balance
and
more
balance
nothing
predominates
here
but
you
get
a
good
mix
of
hops
malt
and
complex
beer
characteristics
coffee
toffee
chocolate
backberry
citrus
caramel
yummy
it
is
best
in
summer
and
fall
but
can
really
be
drunk
year
round
it
is
that
good
poured
into
a
nonic
a
hazed
burnt
orange
with
a
great
fluffy
crown
atop
leaving
multiple
layers
of
lace
as
it
settled
slowly
into
a
cramy
massnice
to
see
this
is
unfiltered
mild
aromas
of
herbal
hop
and
caramelbiscuit
malt
flavors
are
also
on
the
mild
side
staying
more
true
to
the
intended
styleleafy
and
herbal
mixing
with
toffee
and
caramelbiscuit
malt
iam
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
subtle
style
but
this
is
a
nice
quaffing
epa
notes
an
excellent
brew
with
session
appeal
and
easy
enough
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
i
could
have
a
lot
of
these
if
i
wanted
to
looks
like
the
color
of

and
a
light

slight
fruity
note
bready

dry
grainy
taste
lingering
bitter
tea
after
taste
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
aggressive
carbontion
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
tried
to
be
as
fair
as
possible
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
session
beer
12oz
bottle
into
a
corsendonk
tulip
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
a
decent
amount
of
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
crisp
hops
providing
a
nice
balance
the
beer
is
quite
light
and
smooth
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
english
ale
one
i
could
certainly
see
having
again
this
is
a
very
good
ale
a
very
unique
american
beer
true
to
the
english
style
very
fruity
aromas
from
the
yeast
with
a
mild
toffee
and
caramel
malt
backbone
i
thought
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
of
the
aromas
but
overall
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
clean
and
very
sessionable
some
muted
floral
hops
on
the
nose
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
malts
opening
up
later
as
the
head
diminishes
smooth
on
the
tongue
initially
with
some
buttery
malts
and
finishing
slightly
bitter
with
a
hop
bite
and
a
sense
of
cooked
caramel
bitterness
is
well
balanced
however
and
makes
sense
as
i
was
unaware
that
this
was
a
british
pale
originally
offers
a
good
feel
and
drink
given
the
balance
and
structure
overall
i
was
not
overly
impressed
by
this
offering
especially
considering
the
other
reviews
i
saw
the
flavor
was
decent
but
not
in
balance
perhaps
i
would
enjoy
this
better
on
draft
d
excellent
a
perfectly
balanced
ale
wonderful
fresh
delicious
eyeopeningly
good
you
may
not
want
to
share
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
bottle
having
this
growler
available
not
that
the
bottle
is
bad
though
ipswich
is
indeed
one
of
the
unsung
local
heroes
in
my
book
perhaps
since
they
dont
do
much
in
the
extreme
area
their
wonderful
simple
but
near
perfect
ales
simply
speak
for
themselves
the
pour
is
a
nice
bright
orangebrown
that
darkens
in
the
glass
with
an
offwhite
1
finger
head
good
lacing
later
the
aroma
is
simple
malt
with
hop
slight
gingercinnamon
a
nice
crisp
bite
and
creamy
head
make
this
a
pleasure
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
i
guess
the
abv
puts
it
out
of
session
range
but
this
is
a
decent
no
frills
ale
that
i
can
see
spending
an
evening
with
although
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
much
fruitier
ipswich
ale
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
and
unique
pales
around
the
pour
looked
nice
clody
a
light
orangeamber
color
a
goodlooking
fluffy
head
with
lace
around
the
edges
the
smell
was
crisp
and
clean
a
combination
of
bready
malts
and
some
hop
bitterness
plus
honey
some
fruit
and
some
yeast
thrown
into
the
mix
the
beer
had
a
big
malty
powerful
taste
that
hit
me
with
the
first
sip
it
was
bready
up
front
but
the
aftertaste
had
a
mixture
of
bitter
hops
and
sweet
fruit
the
beer
was
smooth
and
wellbodied
more
so
than
a
lot
of
other
ales
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
packs
a
big
flavor
but
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
delicious
d
easily
drinkable
would
drink
again
and
again
d
hops
balance
out
the
malts
up
front
well
good
easy
drinking
beer
cleanses
the
palette
well
the
hop
finish
is
long
for
such
a
sweet
beer
notes
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
to
be
enjoyed
anytime
of
year
one
of
the
more
underated
beers
cheers
a
really
nice
beer
i
usually
am
not
very
fond
of
this
style
i
prefer
the
apa
this
one
however
was
really
well
done
perfect
balance
all
the
way
around
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
in
the
hops
as
well
as
a
hunger
stopping
breadiness
overall
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
after
my
first
sip
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
this
had
a
lot
more
flavor
than
boddingtons
and
a
little
more
flavor
than
fullers
give
this
one
a
shot
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
wont
get
old
buy
it
and
try
it
d
nice
good
session
ale
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
beer
does
leave
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
faint
hops
the
flavor
is
slightly
bitter
up
front
and
then
the
malt
kicks
in
the
finish
lingers
and
is
pleasantly
bitter
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
would
accompany
most
food
well
d
gonna
go
pour
another
right
now
ill
probably
be
drinking
this
all
night
thanks
donkeyrunner
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
the
original
ale
pours
rich
and
light
brown
and
cloudy
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
head
of
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
latherlike
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
instantly
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
very
pleasant
fruity
hops
that
subtley
balances
the
whole
taste
is
far
more
complex
than
i
thoughta
mix
of
the
aforementioned
malt
and
hops
fruity
and
piney
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
more
than
expected
but
extremely
welcome
in
the
flavor
matrix
with
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
that
along
with
the
subtle
carbonation
and
rich
body
renders
this
one
a
beer
you
cant
easily
put
down
on
the
table
that
is
its
wonderful
i
savored
every
sip
easily
as
good
as
any
ale
english
or
apa
ive
ever
tried
12oz
bottle
obtained
as
part
of

thereafter
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
perhaps
one
of
the
easiest
to
finish
english
pale
ales
ive
had
balanced
full
flavored
not
overpowering
near
perfect
in
every
way
a
solid
choice
a
very
solid
english
style
pale
d
a
nice
big
dry
english
style
ale
that
was
malty
dry
and
enjoyable
decent
carbonation
in
this
one
medium
body
but
still
very
very
drinkable
easy

great
for

a
real
winner
d

is
a
session

for

always
great
stuff
from
ipswich
the
ipswich
ales
have
been
some
of
my
favorite
locals
for
a
while
now
good
to
see
an
old
friend
in
this
one
easydrinking
sessionable
offering
good
job
had
a
pint
while
at
lunch
at
the
sports
depot
in
allston
color
was
dark
ruby
red
not
much
head
though
and
no
noticeable
smell
not
as
hoppy
as
most
pale
ales
on
the
market
hint
of
citrus
to
the
taste
i
mainly
drink
ipswich
ale
due
to
its
excellent
drinkability
its
not
the
best
pa
out
there
but
its
a
decent
offering
by
a
local
brewer
and
it
goes
well
with
food
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
special
thanks
to
aaronjr123
who
doesnt
post
and
is
not
very
active
on
ba
for
bringing
this
one
back
to
me
from
his
recent
vacation
to
boston
pours
cloudy
amber
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
smell
is
slightly
tart
and
lighty
musty
earthy
hops
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
grassy
hops
coming
in
at
first
and
it
finishes
a
little
sweeter
with
some
caramel
maltiness
moderately
full
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
much
more
bitter
and
hoppy
than
expected
of
an
epa
pretty
solid
and
drinkable
thanks
joe
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
beverage
had
a
murky
orange
look
to
it
with
some
good
lacing
and
a
thin
head
aromas
were
slightly
honeyish
with
malts
and
grains
wrapping
around
the
sweet
smells
the
drink
was
really
sweet
even
with
its
earthy
tones
mouthfeel
helped
the
drink
from
not
being
too
overpowering
overall
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
drinkability
the
mix
of
smell
taste
and
feel
are
a
very
nice
combination
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
order
one
when
i
was
at
the
bar
very
nice
beer
for
an
english
pale
this
is
a
local
brew
for
me
being
that
this
brewery
is
not
more
than
an
hour
away
so
for
us
in
new
hampshire
its
still
really
fresh
a
solid
beer
with
great
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
i
havent
had
this
in
awhile
and
i
dont
know
why
ipswich
is
one
of
those
beers
that
have
been
around
awhile
and
are
just
taken
for
granted
and
thats
too
bad
the
downside
to
this
beer
was
its
appearance
it
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
copper
color
but
there
is
just
no
head
to
this
beer
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
a
little
musty
a
bit
floral
and
a
nice
indication
of
balance
to
come
the
beer
is
fairly
medium
bodied
modestly
carbonated
but
i
did
wish
it
had
more
of
a
lasting
head
the
beer
is
very
creamy
on
the
tongue
and
enjoyable
throughout
the
taste
is
just
so
well
balanced
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
bite
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
not
too
dry
not
too
sweet
and
doesnt
have
any
cloying
syrupy
consistency
at
all
there
is
some
biscuity
overtones
some
bready
malts
some
florals
and
then
there
is
the
spicy
hop
bite
at
the
end
that
brings
it
all
together
this
is
a
really
good
beer
worth
seeking
out
i
just
wish
its
appearance
matched
everything
else
lchaim
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date

ibus
the
beer
is
an
unfiltered
orangey
copper
with
medium
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
foamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
few
wisps
of
lace
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
but
there
are
notes
of
malts
and
bitter
leafy
hops
apples
and
oranges
are
the
first
flavors
to
hit
but
there
are
also
flavorful
malts
grapefruit
a
big
bitterness
and
some
astringent
notes
the
body
is
medium
smooth
and
very
dry
with
apple
skins
lingering
on
the
palate
not
too
shabby
a
tasty
session
brew
that
is
hoppy
without
being
too
bitter
nice
to
see
ipswich
back
in
nj
if
youre
a
fan
of
traditional
ale
give
this
a
try
very
balanced
malt
and
hop
mix
very
drinkable
and
well
made
beer
when
its
on
cask
why
not
give
it
a
try
otherwise
pass
pours
a
nice
red
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
tan
colored
head
that
laces
very
nicely
it
smells
of
nice
medium
roasted
malts
witha
nice
earthy
hop
aroma
that
smells
like
a
really
good
beer
it
tastes
of
really
rich
malted
grains
followed
by
a
crisp
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
rounds
out
the
flavor
for
a
really
good
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
great
nice
and
crisp
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
which
makes
it
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
definately
worth
it
try
this
if
you
can
drinkability
great
easy
to
drink
and
i
think
it
does
well
in
all
categories
pours
a
totally
clouded
brown
amber
nose
is
like
syrup
and
sweet
flavor
is
meaty
with
some
hop
character
but
not
completely
dominated
by
it
overall
it
is
mostly
an
earthy
toned
kind
of
beer
feel
is
thick
on
the
liquid
and
good
on
the
bubble
overall
pretty
drinkable
a
bit
thick
and
a
touch
of
salt
on
the
flavor
are
the
only
real
detractors
good
beer
could
drink
these
for
a
while
nice
balance
ok
pretty
strong
hops
for
style
a
nice
balanced
beer
with
a
decent
head
of
foam
copperpumpkin
like
color
this
was
a
real
nice
sipping
beer
i
had
a
growler
of
this
for
thanksgiving
and
just
left
it
out
on
the
back
porch
it
was
about
4850
degrees
outside
so
it
was
the
perfect
temperature
for
this
beer
in
my
opinion
it
tasted
very
fresh
i
would
buy
this
again
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
the
balance
of
hops
fruit
and
malt
is
perfect
in
a
hazy
yeasty
brew
in
its
style
it
is
the
best
ive
had
i
find
it
quite
hoppy
but
it
puts
onenote
hop
bombs
to
shame
if
you
want
hops
more
over
the
top
try
ipswichs
ipa
but
for
my
money
this
ones
got
everything
pours
a
murky
medium
copper
hue
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
very
nice
creamy
layer
lacing
is
pretty
good
on
the
sides
smell
is
an
almost
apple
malt
with
a
slightly
pine
hop
odor
taste
is
a
metalic
malt
flavor
with
an
earth
hop
sting
some
woody
dirt
hops
and
granny
smith
flavors
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
an
almost
medium
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
brewery
has
surprised
me
with
many
of
their
beers
the
oatmeal
stout
especially
d
not
my
favorite
style
i
greatly
prefer
american
pales
but
still
has
great
potential
as
a
session

orange
coloured
beer
slightly
hazy
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
nice
hoppy
aroma
very
fruity
the
flavour
is
also
quite
hoppy
throughout
with
resinous
notes
and
some
malty
sweetness
not
bad
at
all
the
style
seems
more
american
than
english
to
me
though
but
what
do
i
know
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
beer
in
bahston
and
i
look
forward
to
the
third
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
amber
in
color
with
a
fairly
thick

that
retained
well

whole
lot
in
the
aroma
primarily
sweet
grain
nice
taste
malt
some
subtle
fruit
and
some
light

very
well
put

ipswich
original
ale
pours
orange
amber
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
some
caramel
and
toasted
grain
taste
has
the
fruitiness
for
sure
with
a
pleasant
dried
apricot
note
as
well
as
caramel
toasted
malt
and
a
balancing
bitterness
that
shows
how
well
this
beer
is
crafted
the
hopping
is
dead
on
as
it
doesnt
mask
the
fruitiness
and
makes
this
a
regular
in
my
fridge
and
at
meal
times
the
freshness
in
the
taste
and
aroma
makes
me
think
of
freshly
baked
breadapricot
glazed
brioche
and
evokes
the
same
mouth
watering
response
a
pale
ale
that
stands
out
in
a
craft
beer
scene
flooded
with
mediocre
pale
ales
english
ale
inspired
and
perfectly
excecuted
this
beer
is
a
new
england
classic
this
unfiltered
pale
ale
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
solid
off
white
head
that
is
sustaining
well
nose
is
slightly
malty
with
not
much
else
to
offer
taste
is
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
malty
pale
with
hints
of
sour
apple
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
light
for
the
style
but
all
elements
pull
together
nicely
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
am
sure
contribures
nicely
to
a
tailgate
at
patriot
home
games
an
average
drinker
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
poured
this
ugly
beer
into
a
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
color
was
a
wierd
cloudy
orange
with
yeast
dirt
or
something
floating
around
on
the
bottom
nice
head
at
first
but
then
went
away
bready
tasting
with
a
yeasty
smell
and
taste
slighly
hoppy
and
a
little
bitter
i
will
not
buy
again
its
going
to
ease
your
mind
not
blow
it
peach
colour
base
with
little
fizzy
head
a
very
nice
fruity
pale
with
good
hop
bitterness
only
the
high
carbonation
detracted
though
it
was
very
fresh
yet
some
creaminess
some
lemon
and
orange
and
peach
flavours
malty
aroma
and
dry
finish
refreshing
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
good
kick
to
it
not
very
filling
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
after
a
while
i
might
look
for
something
else
more
flavorful
however
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
style
that
i
havent
really
like
to
much
overall
man
this
is
good
i
bought
a
single
for
2
but
this
is
case
worthy
if
you
can
find
this
buy
it
mercury
brewing
is
new
to
nj
aggressively
hoppy
with
a
firm
malt
backbone
that
balances
it
out
nicely
smooth
tasty
and
easily
drinkable
despite
a
certain
rawness
about
it
this
beer
is
a
classic
a
true
new
england
pale
ale
poured
out
a
nice
light
tan
head
lingered
for
a
bit
amber
in
color
and
quite
hazy
has
a
grainysweet
nose
with
solid
hops
the
taste
is
dominated
by
maltiness
that
is
then
joined
by
a
bitterness
and
finally
an
earthy
bitterness
has
a
slightly
heavy
mediumplus
body
overall
a
well
balanced
beer
but
not
as
balanced
and
refreshing
as
i
expec
from
the
style
a
wellbalanced
and
very
solid
beer
this
beer
looks
delicious
when
poured
a
perfect
even
amber
nice
and
hazy
dense
head
super
malty
a
good
staple
to
keep
in
the
fridge
brew
pours
to
a
dull
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
light
hop
scent
the
taste
is
solid
but
really
is
not
overly
exciting
noticeable
are
grain
and
caramel
malt
flavors
up
front
an
then
a
nice
hop
end
the
hops
are
not
over
powering
what
so
ever
they
just
complement
things
nicely
also
has
a
taste
that
i
am
not
quite
able
to
put
my
finger
on
but
might
be
a
bread
like
quality
finish
is
quite
dry
over
all
a
good
brew
a
nice
sessionsal
but
not
sure
it
would
be
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
overall
a
nice
rendition
of
the
style
a
nice
session
beer
appearance
is
a
really
cloudy
similar
to
that
of
a
freshly
squeezed
apple
juice
with
little
to
no
head
some
hops
are
there
but
the
malt
dominates
the
less
than
large
nose
this
is
one
great
tasting
beer
malty
with
some
bittering
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
malty
with
little
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
you
could
give
the
to
a
bmc
drinker
or
a
seasoned
ba
and
either
would
be
happy
drinkability
super
session
ale
this
is
one
that
accompanied
great
conversation
in
a
bar
and
the
pints
could
just
keep
flowing
all
night
pleasing
palate
carbonation
is
just
right
taste
is
slightly
sweet
mild
citrus
fruit
bouquet
and
pine
balanced
with
some
pleasant
hops
excellent
hop
flavor
and
smell
i
would
have
loved
more
i
love
my
hops
but
seems
right
on
for
the
style
aftertaste
is
a
nice
bitter
earthy
piney
flavor
that
leaves
you
looking
forward
to
another
sip
taste
was
quite
fruity
sweet
and
syrupy
up
front
intense
malts
burnt
sugar
and
a
touch
of
spice
came
through
hops
dominated
on
the
back
end
and
lasted
well
into
the
huge
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
dry
and
crisp
yet
refreshing
all
too
easy
to
drink
and
i
was
happy
to
see
it
on
cask
again
last
monday
july
17
on
tap
this
beer
comes
together
plenty
of
the
malt
sweetness
i
felt
i
was
missing
from
the
bottle
hops
are
spoton
herbal
and
tealike
quite
balanced
and
feels
authentically
british
even
with
a
bit
of
a
mineral
flavor
im
pleased
i
do
think
that
miracle
of
science
should
serve
this
quite
a
bit
warmer
though
classic
middle
of
the
road
new
england
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
beer
from
ipswich
but
a
great
beer
none
the
less
i
have
to
get
this
off
the
brewerys
tap
asap
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
english
style
ale
exhibits
a
hazy
orange
body
topped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
primarily
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruity
esters
not
outstanding
but
appealing
to
the
nose
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
malt
sweetness
with
a
fair
bit
of
hop
flavor
more
than
i
was
expecting
the
bitterness
balances
the
malt
well
and
does
not
completely
fade
once
you
swallow
the
dry
finish
is
refreshing
and
lends
a
bit
more
to
the
drinkability
of
this
very
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
with
decent
carbonation
and
as
mentioned
before
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
just
begs
you
to
take
another
sip
this
was
a
pleasant
find
on
a
recent
trip
to
the
boston
area
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
very
nice
drinkability
what
can
i
say
i
usually
get
it
by
the
growler
its
a
great
brew
a
nice
hearty
rich
full
bodied
sweet
ale
poured
a
cloudy
opaque
orange
amber
color
smell
is
of
ripe
apples
with
a
subtle
malt
background
mouthfeel
is
on
the
creamy
side
nice
taste
is
fruity
followed
by
the
hop
bitterness
which
is
very
understated
has
a
sour
apple
cider
flavor
that
i
just
didnt
care
for
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
one
again
unbalanced
in
terms
of
flavor
and
texture
flawed
nothing
exciting
about
the
original
i
would
definately
suggest
this
beer
cask
conditioned
it
was
just
that
much
better
growler
from
lukes
liquors
in
brewster
being
a
resident
of
western
mass
i
rarely
have
the
opportunity
to
have
and
eastern
mass
growler
this
was
the
first
true
craft
brew
i
ever
had
so
long
ago
it
used
to
come
it
a
clear
growler
where
you
could
see
the
sediment
nice
looking
beer
deep
amber
color
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
give
righteous
head
retention
fruitiness
followed
by
hops
different
transition
from
othe
east
coast
ipas
it
had
been
several
years
since
ive
had
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
revisited
it
very
balanced
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
ill
be
back
to
this
again
soon
overall
very
well
done
but
i
think
i
prefer
their
dark
just
by
just
a
tad
this
is
a
great
little
ale
from
ipswich
it
pours
with
a
decent
head
and
the
classic
ale
color
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
but
well
balanced
rich
and
smooth
the
carbonation
and
overall
feel
is
just
about
perfect
with
makes
me
want
to
have
another
this
one
is
going
to
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
quite
a
bit
this
summer
i
picked
up
a
mixed
12pack
of
ipswich
ale
after
doing
some
field
work
all
day
in
ipswich
ma
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
the
ipa
oatmeal
stout
and
dark
ale
one
thing
it
wasnt
was
uneventful
and
as
i
review
more
of
these
that
is
becoming
a
bigger
issue
of
mine
the
journey
that
is
the
drink
i
would
try
this
again
to
continue
that
journey
another
solid
effort
from
mercury
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
believe
that
my
bottle
my
have
been
overexposed
to
some
of
the
winter
elements
yet
this
was
still
delicious
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
scant
14
light
beige
head
over
the
orangey
amber
brew
which
has
numerous
large
and
small
floaties
throughout
even
though
great
care
was
taken
pouring
head
is
gone
quickly
leaving
an
uneven
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
is
average
aroma
is
earthy
malty
with
a
tinge
of
hoppiness
taste
is
also
pervaded
with
earthiness
but
the
balance
of
this
brew
is
appreciated
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
but
could
be
cleaner
overall
better
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
another
to
revisit
in
case
of
an
off
bottle
this
is
just
a
rock
solid
pale
ale
all
around
it
pours
a
lovely
orange
to
amber
colour
with
a
big
sticky
fluffed
head
the
smell
is
of
burnt
grain
fruity
hops
and
earthy
malt
theres
a
nice
underlying
sweetness
as
well
this
one
presents
itself
as
hearty
but
restrained
in
a
good
way
and
it
delivers
the
flavour
starts
out
a
touch
hoppy
before
moving
into
a
malt
flavour
that
is
dirty
and
bark
like
at
times
with
hints
of
bread
and
biscuit
hops
are
revisited
again
at
the
finish
which
is
slightly
sweeter
than
the
beginning
there
is
somewhat
of
a
dry
iced
tea
feel
and
flavour
here
as
well
its
just
a
nice
brew
all
around
that
makes
for
a
great
sessional
a
great
version
of
this
style
quite
hazy
copper
with
a
tan
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
but
laces
well
malty
nutty
citrus
and
fruity
smells
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
bit
of
hops
too
nice
malty
toasty
flavor
with
nice
big
caramel
presence
sweet
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
with
plum
and
light
chocolate
flavors
thow
in
some
hoppy
bitterness
to
clean
things
up
towards
the
end
almost
ipa
like
medium
bodied
with
snappy
carbonation
this
is
one
beer
that
definietly
needs
to
warm
some
in
the
glass
it
tastes
much
bettter
close
to
room
temp
really
nice
pale
ale
that
i
come
back
to
frequently
the
beer
after
its
debarkation
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
lightly
hazed
golden
amber
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
is
modest
in
size
the
resultant
lace
a
thin
blanket
to
lie
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
slight
hop
floral
spiciness
backed
by
sweet
malt
citrus
crisp
and
clean
start
is
sweet
with
a
pleasant
grain
profile
top
is
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
patiently
hopped
and
pleasing
in
its
acidity
with
the
aftertaste
droughty
and
long
lasting
ipswich
makes
some
fine
session
beers
just
sorry
my
friends
who
visit
only
visit
once
a
year
but
im
thankful
they
always
bring
back
a
six
pack
of
beer
for
poor
old
gusler
lol
half
inch
frothy
head
which
subsided
to
a
fullcoverage
sheen
by
the
end
lacing
present
mellow
golden
hue
that
poured
somewhat
hazy
and
i
wondered
if
that
was
usual

i
didnt
remember
that
it
was
for
some
reason
hops
are
the
first
thing
noticed
in
the
bouquet
followed
by
an
odd
key
lime
presence
great
pale
profile
to
taste
with
just
the
weird
aforementioned
tartness
a
little
slippery
on
the
palate
but
thats
balanced
by
the
acidity
i
am
really
glad
i
sampled
this
beer
this
could
be
one
perfect
session
beer
for
a
long
evening
of
drinking
in
a
sentence
i
would
describe
an
bold
ale
with
far
more
flavor
than
expected
pours
a
nice
gold
amber
good
head
retention
lacy
and
white
smell
is
light
and
spicy
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppy
almost
but
not
quite
ipalike
i
got
much
more
from
this
beer
than
i
thought
possible
and
i
highly
applaud
it
a
fluffy
white
head
aboard
a
hazy
golden
body
good
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
spicy
grassy
and
herbal
with
a
bit
of
buttered
biscuit
caramel
sweetness
behind
it
taste
is
big
vegetal
hoppage
with
said
spiciness
then
a
grain
ride
takes
it
slowly
out
great
lasting
finish
is
so
damn
smooth
very
fresh
farm
taste
like
you
are
running
through
fields
of
golden
barley
with
kent
golding
hops
in
a
crown
on
your
head
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
semislick
with
low
carbonation
there
is
a
little
sting
and
a
little
oxidation
no
bottling
date
but
both
can
be
overlooked
with
such
a
great
feel
and
drinkability
another
great
one
from
ipswich
my
favorite
local
bottling
brewery
unfiltered
orangeytan
in
hue
with
a
hint
of
amber
it
is
a
very
lovely
color
a
rocky
white
head
of
two
fingers
in
height
gracefully
tops
of
the
beer
the
head
retention
was
very
good
it
faded
in
time
to
a
foamy
cap
a
collar
lasted
the
entire
consumption
the
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
poorly
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
bouquet
is
pleasantly
fruity
quite
amble
and
very
juicy
succulent
in
a
word
i
just
love
the
apple
grape
orange
and
pear
aromas
the
malty
smells
blend
perfectly
with
the
fruity
aspects
the
kisses
of
caramel
kick
up
the
fruitiness
a
notch
pleasantly
earthy
too
the
hops
also
add
some
hay
notes
with
a
kiss
of
citrus
zest
it
is
very
nice
the
potency
is
modest
i
find
it
very
inviting
the
nose
seems
east
coast
pale
ale
all
the
way
but
the
palate
has
a
larger
english
say
with
just
an
east
coast
twist
the
bouquets
invitation
matches
the
palate
perfectly
honestly
the
palate
is
more
flavorful
than
the
nose
indicated
this
is
a
major
plus
the
earthy
flavors
are
very
big
and
very
bold
this
is
needed
to
balance
out
the
burst
of
fruit
and
solid
hop
bitterness
mixed
in
with
the
pear
grape
and
orange
flavors
are
a
hint
of
bubblegum
a
kiss
of
hay
prickly
citrus
bitterness
and
more
earthy
flavors
this
is
damn
tasty
the
flavors
are
very
wide
and
quite
encompassing
there
are
a
lot
of
small
complexities
working
in
the
beer
good
wholesome
sweetness
a
little
bready
this
is
an
awesome
beer
long
aftertaste
mediummediumfull
in
body
the
carbonation
is
modest
but
natural
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
i
like
it
this
is
an
amazingly
tasty
beer
tremendously
awesome
very
drinkable
this
beer
would
be

a

thanks
to
noclueaboutbeer
for
hauling
this
one
out
to
kansas
all
the
way
from
connecticut
a
very
nice
beer
a
bit
too
fruity
for
my
taste
but
certainly
a
good
brew
to
have
while
out
every
now
and
then
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit

with
pale

the
taste
is
good
a
refreshing
pale

thats
well

not

not

right
the
mouthfeel

this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
in
a
hurry
a
fine
example
of
a
pale
ale
perfectly
bracing
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
biscuits
yeast
a
little
hops
and
maybe
even
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
just
to
make
it
supremely
drinkable

johnny
p
delivers
the
goods
again
thanks
to
jp
i
can
now
assert
that
ipswich
is
one
damn
fine
brewery
or
mercury
cat
or
whatever
great
beers
perhaps
underrated
and
underappreciated
by
some
their
beers
are
worth
seeking
out
poured
a
beautiful
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
bread
and
citrus
the
taste
was
a
huge
letdown
for
me
it
seemed
quite
hop
dominated
at
the
end
not
my
idea
of
a
traditional
ale
but
thats
just
me
mouthfeel
was
solid
with
some
malts
and
carbonation
its
an
ok
ale
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
ill
stick
with
ipswichs
dark
beers
now
where
can
i
find
this
one
on
cask
a
beer
with
attitude
whenever
i
think
of
the
pilgrims
drinking
ale
ii
think
it
must
have
tasted
like
this
beer
cloudy
orange
with
just
a
whimpsy
head
this
beer
has
a
great
hopped
bite
that
gets
your
attention
the
bitter
taste
does
not
fade
this
is
beer
thhat
goes
the
distance
an
american
classic
a
great
basic
ale
this
beer
is
done
right
all
the
way
nice
orange
amber
with
a
solid
head
balance
is
beauty
nice
malts
and
hops
great
mouthfeel
good
with
food
or
without
a
dependable
brew
worth
a
pint
for
sure
if
you
can
get
it
the
appearance
of
this
ale
was
a
bright
golden
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
foamy
white
head
with
very
good
retention
receeding
to
a
laceleaving
film
midway
malt
aromas
are
present
but
are
overpowered
by
the
floral
hop
aroma
light
mouthfeel
citrusy
crisp
and
perfectly
balanced
with
hops
a
very
light
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
from
ipswich
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaving
specks
of
lace
very
unique
and
inviting
aroma
of
nutty
grains
sweet
tangerines
and
wet
hay
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
toast
and
marmalade
fading
quickly
to
a
dry
earthy
hop
finish
a
very
nice
session
ale
more
of
an
amber
style
than
a
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
stuff
this
is
a
great
beer
to
give
to
a
person
just
starting
thier
journey
into
micros
a
solid
beer
with
crisp
hop
bite
that
flirts
with
ipa
status
a
hoppy
refreshing
apa
in
the
sierra
nevada
style
a
cloudly
light
orange
color
with
a
soft
and
thin
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
this
beer
has
a
pungent
piney
aroma
with
some
additional
more
delicate
fruity
notes
the
bold
hoppy
presence
alongside
a
strongly
carbonated
body
make
this
an
exciting
brew
especially
in
the
first
few
sips
the
flavor
profile
is
dominated
by
a
hoppy
bite
that
gives
way
to
fruity
and
herbal
notes
at
the
back
of
the
palate
there
is
also
a
strange
character
to
the
finish
that
i
want
to
call
bubblegum
though
thats
a
flavor
that
i
do
not
normally
associate
with
this
style
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
ipswich
very
new
england
i
have
had
this
beer
only
in
a
tin
can
its
either
been
absolutely
horrible
or
phenomenal
worth
a
second
taste
if
you
have
had
a
bad
experience
from
years
ago
not
my
thing
a
bit
creamy
nitro
can
pours
amber
with
perfect
nitro
foam
smells
of
bread
biscuit
and
cooked
sugar
flavors
are
the
same
in
this
highly
drinkable
brew
a
staple
if
not
the
most
interesting
certainly
reliable
and
enjoyable
en
masse
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
had
a
decent
color
but
lacked
any
strong
scent
hint
of
a
bitter
caramel
tasted
watered
down
pretty
dull
and
disappointing
but
there
is
worse
out
there
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
solid
english
pale
ale
delicious
not
earth
shattering
but
completely
solid
an
exceptional
beer
that
looks
and
tastes
outstanding
nose
malt
caramel
biscuit
faint

slight
metallic

slight

nuttiness
herbal
toast
earthy
very
fine
out
of
draught
and
fine
in
bottle
for
me
was
okay
but
nothing
special
this
was
an
average
brew
at
best
pretty
much
the
pinnacle
of
an
ambercopper
color
typical
of
esbsenglish
pale
ales
one
finger
of
head
even
after
a
vigorous
pour
suggests
low
carbonation
typical
of
imitation
cask
ale
head
stuck
around
throughout
the
experience
however
on
the
nose
i
get
mostly
caramel
malts
a
touch
of
bready
malts
and
yeast
some
fruit
esters
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
english
hops
just
to
tie
everything
together
on
the
palate
i
get
a
rich
yet
balanced
and
not
overly
dense
caramel
flavor
coupled
with
some
slight
fruity
esters
toffee
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
are
also
there
bitterness
is
well
managed
and
makes
the
beer
very
quaffable
this
could
be
easy
to
drink
many
of
i
personally
found
it
subtle
yet
refreshing
it
embodies
many
of
the
qualities
that
make
a
good
bitter
yet
in
a
more
subtle
drinker
friendly
manner
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
what
i
got
was
slightly
more
than
that
nice
on
the
front
end
but
the
after
taste
was
reminiscent
of
a
runofthe
mill
brew
smelled
like
a
dead
skunk
on
the
road
and
didnt
taste
much
better
had
one
a
few
years
back
and
enjoyed
it
baught
a
case
as
it
was
on
sale
think
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
taste
was
quite
savoury
almost
like
a
v8
very
unexpected
clear
amber
colour
samll
not
lasting
head
minimal
lace
smell
of
sulphurs
toffee
light
body
soft
carbonation
taste
of
toffee
and
malts
overall
quite
a
nice
traditional
english
pale
ale
driven
by
sweet
malts
and
definitely
something
one
doesnt
put
away
too
quickly
i
found
it
a
bit
cloying
if
i
tried
to
down
it
better
to
just
read
the
paper
chat
to
the
barman
and
enjoy
it
over
a
decent
session
by
the
time
it
gets
to
us
in
aus
it
is
usually
expensive
at
au83
a
case
but
ill
take
a
6pack
every
now
and
then
the
old
speckled
hen
is
a
caramel
colored
ale
with
a
thin
head
and
very
light
lacing
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
mediciny
aftertaste
overall
4
solid
beer
i
am
going
to
purchase
another
one
next
time
im
at
the
beer
store
drink
this
everyweek
best
home
beer
in
a
bottle
you
could
want
not
a
big
fan
of
chilled
beer
but
a
cool
specklage
hits
the
spot
love
this
beer
if
you
have
not
tried
it
please
do
nice
english
ale
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
doesnt
have
an
overwhelming
taste
either
way
makes
a
great
session
ale
with
nice
malt
presence
i
tell
you
what
wrong
i
was
thats
a
really
smooth
and
wide
pale
ale
with
strong
taste
and
smell
of
grassy
hops
and
a
fantastic
bitter
aftertaste
low
carbonation
like
from
a
cask
its
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
good
from
a
bottle
surprisingly
pours
out
like
a
draft
out
of
a
can
smoooooth
premium
beer
just
saw
that
this
is
the
same
brewery
that
makes
innis
gunn
oak
aged
both
are
bottled
in
clear
bottles
i
was
warned
long
ago
about
beer
that
is
not
protected
from
the
light
never
had
a
reason
to
come
down
on
one
side
or
the
other
on
this
point
what
i
do
know
is
this
brew
needs
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
gnome
sayin
reviewing
from
a
distant
memory
but
this
one
always
stuck
out
in
my
head
as
being
dominated
by
toasted
lightly
sweet
malt
that
reminded
me
of
caramel
corn
accompanied
by
floral
hops
again
i
do
feel
a
bit
bad
about
this
review
and
based
on
what
others
are
saying
here
i
wonder
if
i
got
a
bad
one
or
the
bar
hadnt
cleaned
their
pipes
in
a
while
certainly
i
have
had
speckled
hen
before
a
long
time
ago
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
that
bad
so
i
feel
there
is
a
good
chance
something
was
up
here
so
i
promise
to
give
it
another
day
in
court
back
in
the
uk
and
see
if
it
improves
any
if
it
does
i
will
repost

dad
liked
it
usually
a
sign
that
it
wont
knock
my
socks
off
such
a
different
beer
and
far
superior
from
the
nitro
tap
than
it
is
from
the
bottle
this
is
often
thin
and
skunky
in
its
clear
glass
but
its
rich
and
frothy
and
malty
in
that
nutty
but
not
too
sweet
way
from
the
nitro
tap
the
infusion
of
the
nitro
gas
helps
its
feel
too
creamy
and
puffy
on
the
palate
with
a
lasting
white
head
and
ring
lacing
as
it
sips
down
plenty
of
bittering
hops
characteristic
more
of
an
esb
type
than
an
english
pale
to
me
but
it
sort
of
traverses
style
norms
in
a
number
of
respects
i
like
the
almost
almond
flavored
malt
on
the
front
end
and
that
it
stays
pretty
light
throughout
enough
hops
to
balance
it
but
remain
drinkable
i
know
this
one
is
a
classic
overseas
that
has
been
largely
under
appreciated
by
the
north
american
crowd
but
i
think
thats
a
little
unfair
and
that
that
the
clear
glass
hasnt
done
it
any
favors
overall
a
beer
that
demands
a
time
and
a
place
but
when
those
to
occur
its
delicious
poured
from
can
strong
aroma
of
caramel
clear
amber
color
with
white
head
a
light
sweet
taste
medium
body
creamy
texture
with
average
carbonation
and
a
very
mild
bitter
finish
overall
a
very
smooth
brew
that
goes
down
easy
would
have
again
worth
trying
3
75
at
5
this
is
a
little
higher
abv
than
what
i
would
call
a
good
session
beer
but
then
again
i
probably
drink
a
little
more
than
i
should
so
im
likely
to
find
myself
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
until
i
find
myself
a
good
supplier
of
better
micros
solid
brew
overall
really
drinkable
and
approachable
mellow
body
and
slight
cinnamon
apple
feel
going
on
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
apple
feel
is
more
on
the
green
side
one
of
the
first
beers
that
i
really
enjoyed
when
getting
into
craft
beers
nearly
15
years
ago
had
from
cask
at
the
iron
duke
pub
in
victoiia
station
london
had
a
bit
of
a
sour
taste
from
the
cask
dont
remember
that
from
a
bottle
love
most
cask
ales
but
would
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
unless
it
was

for

out
there
what

a

give
us
imperial

if
these

id
say
its
a
true
session
beer
taste
palate
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bready
maltiness
up
front
along
with
some
mild
caramel
and
toffee
sweetness
hop
flavor
comes
in
quickly
and
adds
some
dryness
and
mellow
bitterness
to
the
finish
ooverall
a
great
beer
was
surprised
how
tasty
especially
for
breakfast
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
mixed
six
from
uncle
mike
i
like
it
im
not
sure
it
is
worth
what
i
sometimes
see
it
priced
at
but
it
is
very
good
i
will
buy
it
again
if
it
is
on
sale
mouthfeel
is
really
light
the
end
is
dry
really
nice
i
may
try
another
and
update
this
as
its
dissapointing
its
a
big
brewery
and
usually
consistent
green
king
ipa
is
a
good
choice
if
no
other
ale
is
available
even
if
its
not
that
exciting
overall
the
skunkiness
ruins
a
lot
of
this
the
canned
version
would
be
a
good
bet
morland
old
speckled
hen
35
o
owld
speckled
un
is
probably
my
first
true
example
of
this
style
it
has
so
much
more
flavor
and
character
than
i
expected
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
it
but
wont
seek
it
out
again
anytime
soon
overall
a
pretty
decent
english
pale
ale
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
smokiness
in
this
beer
a
decent
english
pale
ale
overall
id
probably
have
it
again
o
not
enjoying
the
hop
profile
on
this
very
much
has
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
taste
to
it
perhaps
i
have
not
had
one
in
a
while
or
am
just
remembering
how
good
it
tasted
on
tap
in
england
but
i
guess
i
am
in
the
minority
on
this
one
i
have
always
thought
it
to
be
a
fine
english
palebitter
with
such
a
lovely
aroma
the
creamy
buttery
body
and
malthop
balance
always
impressed
me
on
some
level
i
do
object
to
so
many
english
ales
being
overlooked
in
the
u
s
that
may
be
due
to
lack
of
freshness
but
with
some
of
the
sturdier
higher
alcohol
level
bitters
that
should
not
be
as
much
of
an
issue
perhaps
english
pales
and
bitters
are
just
not
en
vogue
right
now
like
ipas
and
strong
stouts
taste
strong
wheat
bread
overtones
followed
by
smooth
and
creamy
malts
fading
into
a
spicy
hop
finish
it
is
like
a
liquid
loaf
of
bread
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
hits
all
of
the
points
i
expect
an
epa
to
hit
o
well
its
a
nitrocan
beer
ergo
it
wasnt
going
to
be
plagued
by
the
skunk
you
get
from
clear
bottles
that
and
its
drop
dead
gorgeous
look
is
about
where
my
praise
ends
theres
nothing
bad
about
it
theres
just
not
much
good
about
it
either
its
really
telling
that
this
is
far
less
drinkable
than
the
8
7
dipa
i
had
right
before
this
this
certainly
felt
stronger
than
it
was
in
actuality
and
had
i
bought
another
one
of
these
i
could
have
easily
downed
it
after
finishing
this
off
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
body
to
the
malt
here
and
because
this
was
so
light
it
wasnt
heavy
or
even
as
bitter
as
other
english
beers
that
ive
rated
highly
in
the
past
this
is
a
nofrills
ale
thats
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
at
the
same
time
needed
something
to
go
along
with
it
as
a
snack
perhaps
some
fish
and
chips
overall
a
good
pale
with
classic
british
malt
character
and
a
nice
noble
hop
balance
at
5
2
this
beer
approaches
being
sessionable
the
draught
on
nitro
added
to
the
drinkability
poured
out
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
the
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
mild
with
slight
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
bread
the
taste
comes
through
though
with
more
developed
flavors
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
nice
earthy
hops
character
in
addition
its
not
a
huge
flavor
but
it
works
well
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
but
mirrors
the
flavor
profile
its
not
the
most
outstanding
english
pale
but
a
good
one
all
the
same
it
feels
flat
to
me
but
tastes
great
something
to
continue
experimenting
with
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
especially
on
tap
i
love
the
malty
toffee
flavor
and
the
smooth
finish
rather
underwhelming
overall
a
similar
expieriance
to
guinness
on
nitro
tap
unlike
guinness
however
this
beer
is
a
little
lacking
in
character
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
aside
from
the
unique
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
cool
and
it
sure
is
pretty
to
look
at
the
taste
however
is
underwhelming
a
promising
ale
let
down
by
the
draught
can
format
except
for
some
visual
flair
it
just
doesnt
work
for
pale
ales
usually
though
i
agree
that
this
is
a
reasonably
solid
standby
on
draft
at
least
i
remember
liking
it
best
the
first
time
i
had
it
for
its
hearty
bready
malt
really
like
a
freshly
baked
loaf
of
wholegrain
bread
in
refreshing
liquid
form
since
then
i
have
liked
it
a
little
less
each
time
but
still
regard
it
as
a
good
first
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
amber
with
a
medium
slowly
fading
beige
head
aroma
and
taste
of
toasted
cereal
malt
yeast
slightly
fruity
with
a
bit
of
toffee
flavor
a
medium
body
smooth
with
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
toasted
caramel
malt
light
fruity
and
yeast
notes
ending
with
some
sweet
toffee
and
nutty
flavors
overall
a
good
refreshing
session
brew
o
still
a
good
staple
ale
gorgeous
summertime
ale
enjoyed
poured
from
bottle
on
a
beach
in
perfect
sunshine
bright
golden
amber
colour
clear
as
the
sky
i
drank
it
under
with
a
single
centimeter
of
cloudlike
head
resting
and
holding
for
some
time
scent
perhaps
obscured
by
the
saltiness
of
the
sea
but
caught
pleasant
wiffs
of
apricot
and
berrys
distict
peachy
taste
with
slight
hop
bittering
just
like
so
many
of
the
ales
i
like
the
most
5
2
but
didnt
realise
until
part
way
through
the
fourth
bottle
aha
o
somewhat
similar
to
the
old
golden
hen
already
reviewed
in
its
refreshing
fruitiness
but
osh
is
lighter
and
with
more
of
a
distinct
peachlike
tinge
it
was
great
as
a
dinner
ale
and
continued
to
delight
as
it
was
finished
afterwards
perhaps
ironic
that
the
entree
was
chicken
surely
a
fine
choice
in
warm
weather
theres
a
touch
of
smoothness
in
this
beer
that
isnt
particularly
crisp
barely
more
than
light
in
body
it
does
seem
to
be
stretching
for
medium
and
just
makes
it
malt
driven
and
there
is
a
baseline
of
quality
but
all
toned
down
and
a
bit
dull
a
butter
bomb
when
fresh
on
cask
a
case
study
for
maris
otter
overall
kind
of
a
niche
beer
very
similar
to
boddingtons
and
definitely
better
medium
brown
ale
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
nuts
caramel
and
wood
flavors
of
mild
spice
and
woodleaves
has
a
light
sessionable
body
and
plenty
of
flavor
there
was
some
mild
skunk
when
the
bottle
was
first
opened
but
it
became
imperceptible
after
pouring
a
great
example
of
english
ale
o
would
drink
again
if
it
was
presented
o
overall
its
what
youd
expect
from
an
english
pale
ale
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
bitterness
but
not
too
much
o
nothing
special
here
but
i
would
drink
this
any
day
over
anything
in
the
bmc
portfolio
overall
i
would
give
this
beer
high
3s
out
of
five
its
an
excellent
beer
but
not
what
i
would
call
world
class
would
i
seek
this
out
probably
not
as
i
have
built
up
a
list
of
beers
in
this
realm
that
i
like
better
i
do
like
it
though
would
i
recommend
this
beer
hayle
yes
just
as
i
would
recommend
trying
any
new
beer
just
to
try
something
different
because
you
never
know
if
this
could
be
the
one
there
is
the
chance
this
could
be
it
for
you
an
easy
beer
to
drink
for
all
occasions
pairs
well
with
almost
any
hearty
food
and
can
be
enjoyed
just
as
well
on
its
own
overall
a
beer
that
is
mild
and
drinkable
and
should
accompany
many
dishes
well
for
you
somaliers
out
there
i
have
been
on
something
of
a
british
beer
kick
lately
and
will
probably
try
several
other
new
ones
new
to
me
that
is
before
returning
to
this
one
food
match
old
speckled
roasted
hen
would
go
great
with
this
o
a
nice
basic
english
ale
the
mix
of
very
traditional
malt
and
hop
flavors
and
the
biggerthanaverage
body
makes
this
an
excellent
readily
available
brew
its
not
explosive
innovative
or
exciting
but
this
is
very
tasty
and
very
wellcrafted
for
a
massproduced
ale
definitely
worth
checking
out
for
fans
of
english
ales
and
those
curious
about
them
o
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
its
a
pleasant
easydrinking
beer
im
on
a
pale
ale
trip
right
now
i
tried
this
mirror
pond
and
belhaven
at
the
same
time
this
beer
placed
third
behind
belhaven
and
mirror
pond
i
enjoyed
it
but
like
the
other
two
better
it
was
third
in
flavor
third
in
finish
if
it
were
on
sale
im
in
it
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
that
fades
fast
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
a
little
earthy
notes
of
fig
and
molasses
with
a
slight
vegetative
quality
on
the
nose
with
a
little
butterscotch
as
well
the
taste
is
comparable
to
that
of
an
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
there
is
also
a
slight
underlying
bitterness
the
carbonation
is
delightfully
light
and
it
has
a
heavier
mouthfeel
than
i
was
expecting
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
cream
top
a
la
nitrocan
smells
of
light
sweet
malts
some
caramel
some
milk
some
tea
and
light
grassy
hops
pleasant
nose
flavor
carries
plenty
of
amber
malts
some
tea
some
slight
wood
character
overall
not
particularly
complex
but
quite
well
balanced
full
bodied
with
nitro
carb
and
a
forgettable
finish
overall
i
find
this
can
of
beer
pretty
enjoyable
o
i
bought
this
to
use
in
a
beer
cheddar
soup
naturally
i
drank
some
while
i
cooked
definitely
a
beer
you
can
drink
with
food
not
offensive
not
super
high
alcohol
thin
and
easy
drinking
for
a
session
beer
it
gets
the
job
done
worked
very
well
in
the
soup
nothing
spectcular
here
like
a
good
bar
band
fits
in
makes
things
feel
right
but
never
going
to
have
a
gold
record
overall
this
is
just
a
simple
light
pale
ale
pretty
drinkable
this
was
the
bottled
version
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
the
nitro
can
o
id
pass
on
this
one
nothing
about
it
really
entices
me
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
slightly
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
o
i
would
have
no
problem
sharing
a
couple
of
these
with
me
mates
receive
2
points
for
apropos
british
ref
although
it
wouldnt
be
my
choice
were
it
my
turn
to
buy
a
round
well
balance
and
very
easy
drinkable
ale
the
overall
feeling
is
not
too
thin
and
not
too
bold
with
great
mouthfeel
by
the
way
overall
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
again
in
the
draught
can
very
good
beer
at
a
very
good
price
worth
your
time
if
you
want
to
explore
english
beer
like
i
am
doing
so
now
overall
very
good
beer
and
looks
beautiful
in
a
glass
but
the
sourness
at
the
end
of
the
sip
becomes
cloying
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
i
imagine
it
would
be
great
to
pair
this
beer
with
steak
definitely
couldnt
finish
the
four
pack
i
have
in
a
night
or
even
probably
a
week
it
has
too
much
going
on
to
be
anything
more
than
a
sipper
through
the
night
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
is
almost
too
much
like
a
india
pale
ale
and
not
my
daily
drinker
this
would
good
with
a
steak
or
a
fine
saucy
meal
o
not
my
favorite
a
friend
showed
up
with
six
of
these
this
is
the
first
and
maybe
the
last
she
thought
i
would
like
it
overall
a
strange
beer
but
not
without
merit
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
firm
ester
profile
on
hand
pump
at
teresas
dark
amber
with
huge
creamy
pinkie
width
white
head
tons
of
lace
here
great
head
retention
faint
malts
here
in
the
nose
caramel
stands
out
creamy
feel
smooth
caramel
malts
good
flavors
and
a
bit
understated
in
terms
of
flavor
but
made
up
for
in
feel
good
drinking
ale
here
good
stuff
o
if
drink
ability
were
still
a
factor
it
would
get
top
marks
in
this
category
overall
its
a
very
pleasant
simple
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
while
relaxing
on
the
back
patio
outside
as
i
am
doing
right
now
o
its
ok
nothing
special
i
have
trouble
getting
past
the
smell
and
i
wish
i
knew
what
was
in
here
that
gave
it
that
aroma
tastes
better
than
it
smells
overall
if
this
beer
were
a
football
team
it
would
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
championship
however
having
drunk
my
first
english
ale
for
six
months
here
in
korea
it
tastes
sublime
to
be
expected
from
a
nitro
can
solid
beer
this
easy
to
drink
tasty
enough
this
is
one
of
the
better
nitro
canned
version
of
an
english
pale
ale
out
there
not
something
i
would
keep
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
but
still
tasty
one
of
the
better
english
pale
ales
ive
had
rjt
overall
disappointing
beer
overall
despite
all
i
had
heard
about
how
great
this
was
its
easy
to
drink
but
its
about
as
watery
as
beer
can
get
without
being
actually
being
considered
water
overall
impression
not
too
bad
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
but
im
in
no
hurry
to
buy
another
bottle
overall
i
had
low
expectations
due
to
the
clear
bottle
but
it
turned
out
to
be
slightly
above
average
o
nice
middleoftheroad
beer
for
the
style
good
for
a
few
o
decent
lightbodied
english
brew
no
hop
characteristics
to
pick
out
not
very
complex
decent
mouth
feel
definitely
sessionable
o
super
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
with
a
light
flavor
and
wonderful
creaminess
the
color
is
like
caramel
with
a
foamy
head
that
is
soap
looking
the
head
is
made
up
of
different
bubbles
size
the
aroma
is
bitter
and
shows
signs
of
hops
and
some
caramel
malts
on
the
taste
it
is
caramel
malts
with
a
dry
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
carbonation
is
present
in
the
mouth
medium
to
thin
body
this
is
an
good
pale
ale
however
it
is
a
bit
pricy
poured
from
a
14
9oz
nitro
can
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
beautiful
coppery
color
with
a
creamy
12
head
which
remained
after
the
initial
foamy
cascade
minimal
lacing
very
nice
malty
aroma
with
an
equally
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
is
malty
with
a
minimal
amount
of
hops
hints
of
caramel
also
present
overall
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
english
ale
surprisingly
warming
with
a
smooth
mild
effervescence
fullish
body
slight
coating
of
the
tongue
and
palate
a
real
solid
example
of
the
style
serving
type
can
o
i
like
boddingtons
better
has
just
as
good
of
a
mouthfeel
with
a
more
suitable
flavor
o
old
speckled
hen
is
definitely
worth
the
low
price
i
paid
for
it
its
moderately
fullbodied
and
complex
enough
to
please
this
mild
british
beer
wont
overwhelm
your
palate
with
thick
flavors
but
hey
sometimes
something
mild
and
drinkable
is
just
what
you
need
poured
from
a
nitrotap
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
has
a
foamy
bright
and
lively
cascade
as
the
creamy
smooth
offwhite
head
settles
in
on
the
top
it
looks
like
buttercream
frosting
it
is
so
smooth
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
bright
crystal
clear
vibrant
rubyorange
coloring
aromas
are
rich
and
buttery
toffee
sweetness
with
a
slight
tang
and
a
biscuit
backbone
flavors
are
smooth
and
somewhat
fruity
with
berry
and
cherry
highlights
on
a
toffee
and
caramel
malt
backbone
the
body
is
light
but
velvety
smooth
with
a
creamy
feel
overall
to
go
along
with
the
curtains
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
subtle
roasting
throughout
with
a
slick
tangy
transition
into
a
caramel
sweet
aftertaste
the
finish
is
smooth
and
quick
with
only
a
slight
filmy
linger
left
behind
decent
served
this
way
as
i
was
never
a
huge
fan
from
a
bottle
or
can
whats
not
to
like
o
its
alright
an
easy
drinker
not
too
much
going
on
but
nothing
unpleasant
classic
highlyrecommended
o
there
isnt
anything
right
or
wrong
with
this
brew
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
feel
like
its
a
pretty
classic
example
d
a
decent
english
pale
ale
with
a
fairly
smooth
and
velvety
taste
perhaps
not
the
most
flavourful
but
certainly
sessionable
thankfully
vinegar
was
not
the
taste
old
english
style
beer
absent
hopping
sweet
taste
of
alcohol
to
it
corny
as
it
warms
it
gains
an
even
greater
alcohol
mouthfeel
wow
how
do
people
like
this
is
kind
of
my
thinking
im
usually
pretty
tolerant
but
for
some
of
the
people
who
swear
by
this
stuff
sheesh
gets
all
musty
on
you
nothing
special
i
still
dont
understand
the
point
of
injecting
beer
with
nitrogen
a
lighter
less
flavorful
beer
is
just
not
as
good
in
my
opinion
o
id
say
just
above
average
i
didnt
dislike
it
but
i
thought
it
was
underwhelming
unique
biscuity
flavor
was
enjoyable
while
i
can
see
why
some
people
really
like
osh
i
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
o
standard
english
pale
ale
it
has
all
the
classic
aromas
and
flavors
one
would
associate
with
a
good
epa
and
is
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
flavorful
non
citruspine
hop
forward
pale
ale
cheers
its
not
a
massive
beer
in
your
face
or
otherwise
but
it
is
a
great
example
of
style
and
as
such
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
simple
beer
well
done
top
notch
o
probably
a
decent
session
beer
comparable
in
quality
to
most
popular
english
imports
a
la
newcastle
this
beer
could
be
a
lot
more
interesting
then
again
it
could
be
worse
you
shouldnt
really
expect
a
beer
named
old
speckled
hen
to
be
some
sort
of
refined
english
craft
brew
anyway
for
what
it
is
it
is
alright
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
12
in
white
head
head
is
dense
due
to
the
nitrocan
retention
is
great
as
i
drink
it
leaves
concentric
circles
of
lacing
smell
is
sweet
like
caramel
i
think
im
also
getting
some
malt
and
dark
fruit
sort
of
scent
taste
starts
with
a
overly
clean
sort
of
taste
maybe
its
just
a
dry
flavor
then
i
get
a
touch
of
english
malt
and
more
of
that
dark
fruit
taste
aftertaste
is
a
touch
bitter
mouthfeel
is
thin
not
terribly
impressed
with
this
beer
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
unless
i
am
in
england
od
just
one
word
yum
excellent
in
all
regards
this
is
much
better
than
i
recall
from
my
previous
samplings
of
this
brew
perhaps
the
presentation
in
a
closed
gift
container
with
a
pint
glass
protected
the
clear
bottle
from
light
degradation
all
in
all
im
sad
i
only
have
one
of
these
to
drink
tonight
omeh
people
at
small
breweries
are
working
too
hard
this
just
doesnt
measure
up
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
probably
one
of
my
favorite
epas
this
beer
came
out
a
nice
coppery
red
with
that
great
lingering
head
that
lasted
the
whole
time
of
drinking
the
head
was
creamy
looking
and
texture
and
pure
white
and
made
up
small
bubbles
the
smell
was
mildly
acidic
and
kind
of
vinegary
the
taste
was
also
kind
of
vinegary
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
just
a
touch
and
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
as
well
the
main
flavor
profile
was
the
acidity
the
mouthfeel
was
so
smooth
and
creamy
it
felt
really
great
on
the
palate
overall
this
beer
is
lacking
in
the
flavor
profile
there
just
isnt
much
of
it
there
and
the
the
taste
that
is
there
isnt
an
exceptionally
good
one
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
wish
it
had
a
few
things
that
i
am
missing
overall
good
import
m
so
creamy
its
like
a
red
guiness
but
slightly
less
bitter
that
is
all
i
like
it
t
the
body
is
light
i
was
expecting
more
good
bitterness
nutty
some
caramel
and
an
after
taste
in
toast
malts
medium
dry
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
with
very
low
carbonation
and
a
mediumlight
body
make
for
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
fairly
low
abv
nice
english
session
beer
o
nice
flavours
but
way
too
subdued
and
bland
a
quality
session
beer
its
not
the
most
amazing
beer
in
the
world
but
hits
the
spot
when
wanting
something
with
lower
alcohol
o
i
will
avoid
this
in
the
future
the
consistency
is
what
really
killed
this
drink
for
me
in
all
reality
the
reason
i
picked
this
up
was
just
because
it
was
a
nitrocan
and
this
was
obviously
a
bad
way
to
pick
a
beer
if
you
enjoy
a
watery
beer
then
you
might
enjoy
this
but
this
is
not
for
me
overall
a
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
at
the
same
time
quite
boring
for
the
price
there
are
many
other
beers
i
would
rather
be
having
o
tasty
and
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
a
good
safebet
for
everyday
drinking
either
alone
for
quenching
thirst
or
with
mildflavored
foods
fish
and
chips
comes
to
mind
as
a
good
pairing
for
this
english
pale
ale
check
it
off
the
list
and
on
to
the
next
one
wont
have
again
for
awhile
appearance
is
clear
with
a
slight
amber
tint
smell
is
typical
euro
ale
aroma
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
the
good
thing
is
it
does
not
linger
the
taste
is
that
of
a
pale
ale
and
it
does
have
that
euro
taste
for
us
americanized
tasters
it
is
not
what
we
desire
some
may
prefer
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
not
one
we
will
seek
out
it
has
a
mild
pleasant
odor
and
fairly
mild
taste
of
hops
it
is
not
especially
bitter
i
was
glad
the
restaurant
had
something
to
offer
but
this
was
a
bland
choice
quite
nice
not
must
have
overall
very
boring
beer
the
color
of
the
beer
was
what
drew
me
too
it
but
it
just
fell
flat
just
a
bland
british
beer
o
all
fur
coat
and
no
trousers
a
decent
pint
nicely
balanced
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
balanced
flavors
o
this
is
a
nutty
and
very
clean
beer
much
better
than
i
anticipated
o
a
tasty
english
pale
ale
and
not
too
shabby
for
a
mass
produced
ale
i
could
easily
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
final
grade
3
62
a
b
fresh
bottle
sampled
in
april
2014
produced
a
higher
taste
rating
3
75
but
a
lesser
mouthfeel
and
appearance
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
with
decent
head
little
retention
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
nose
is
warm
malty
and
inviting
a
little
bitter
has
a
malty
fruity
flavor
with
a
biting
finish
light
and
smooth
on
the
palate
overall
its
a
good
beer
nothing
amazing
but
enjoyable
o
easily
drinkable
decently
refreshing
enough
flavourful
and
complex
all
you
could
ask
but
nothing
really
special
first
time
ive
ever
enjoyed
a
canned
beer
more
than
the
cask
version
might
have
been
the
occasion
of
course
ill
remember
that
though
i
usually
slag
off
the
tins
i
dont
think
id
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
do
if
it
wasnt
nitrotapped
but
it
is
and
i
do
o
a
great
beer
with
a
ton
of
complexity
that
is
never
fowl
o
better
than
bass
or
some
of
the
other
wellknown
english
pale
ales
but
its
still
only
a
slightly
above
average
beer
for
me
the
odd
tinny
note
in
the
finish
didnt
help
much
d
session
level
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
a
pretty
decent
price
tag
check
it
out
if
you
havent
had
it
out
of
the
can
even
if
you
dont
prefer
english
brews
this
is
still
a
musttry
color
is
a
clear
dark
amber
the
head
is
composed
of
rather
large
bubbles
but
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
it
smelled
much
like
a
glass
of
wine
to
me
some
alcohol
and
fruity
scents
the
taste
was
different
though
with
malts
in
the
forefront
an
initial
biscuit
flavor
from
the
malts
was
followed
by
a
lemonygrassy
flavor
from
the
hops
nicely
balanced
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
much
like
after
drinking
champagne
aggressive
carbonation
created
a
prickly
feel
on
the
tongue
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
orangey
copper
in
color
smallbubbled
white
foamy
head
diminishes
quickly
very
mild
aroma
medium
body
and
buttery
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
seems
slightly
less
carbonated
out
of
the
bottle
taste
is
earthy
piney
a
bit
toasty
there
are
slight
hints
of
citrus
champagne
and
biscuit
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
strong
and
complex
considering
the
lack
of
aroma
very
drinkable
overall
tasty
beer
which
i
would
like
to
try
on
draught
or
just
on
co2
sometime
quite
refreshing
and
satisfying
average
is
the
word
that
best
describes
this
brew
it
poured
a
one
finger
head
of
pillowy
foam
over
an
amberlight
coloured
body
with
some
lacing
the
smell
was
malt
with
somehops
coming
through
the
tastes
was
much
the
same
with
a
a
cloying
sweetness
coming
through
it
had
a
little
hops
bite
and
was
somewhat
dry
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
little
carbonation
overall
this
brew
did
nothing
to
impress
although
it
is
certainly
drinkable
overall
nice
brew
easy
to
drink
im
glad
i
tried
a
this
classic
but
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
again
odpretty
confused
by
this
one
has
good
points
but
is
one
of
the
skunkier
beers
i
have
had
as
it
warms
it
gets
better
but
as
it
gets
better
i
am
already
thinking
of
what
i
should
be
drinking
next
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
also
goes
down
very
smoothly
good
mouthfeel
for
what
its
worth
but
did
not
hit
the
spot
overall
just
lacking
in
real
pronounced
character
drinkable
for
sure
but
not
real
quenching
prost
creamy
and
very
drinkable
o
i
never
have
any
trouble
taking
this
one
nice
and
slow
especially
as
a
substitution
for
dessert
great
beer
good
job
from
the
blokes
across
the
pond
cheers
a
very
different
taste
that
caught
me
offguard
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
a
bit
the
flavor
started
coming
out
and
i
found
myself
thinking
the
more
i
tasted
it
the
better
it
got
o
ive
always
enjoyed
english
pale
ales
and
old
speckled
hen
is
no
exception
i
havent
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
it
on
tap
since
my
last
visit
to
the
uk
which
was
unfortunately
eight
years
ago
i
have
found
that
marriage
and
children
tend
to
keep
you
stateside
overall
worth
having
had
but
not
by
any
means
my
favorite
of
the
style
what
a
difference
a
fresh
sample
makes
first
time
i
tried
this
it
was
a
skunked
bottle
past
its
prime
and
i
wasnt
impressed
but
last
night
i
had
it
fresh
and
on
tap
huge
difference
poured
a
14
silky
head
which
lasted
almost
to
the
last
drop
in
the
glass
color
as
far
as
i
could
tell
in
the
dark
bar
was
a
lovely
clear
reddish
hue
taste
was
pretty
mild
but
followed
with
a
long
lasting
bitterness
which
i
could
still
taste
after
i
got
home
and
the
body
itself
is
fairly
silky
smooth
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
a
perfectly
acceptable
beer
on
tap
easy
to
drink
with
a
light
to
medium
feel
this
is
one
of
those
go
out
and
buy
a
case
beers
i
could
drink
this
every
day
granted
probably
better
the
closer
to
england
you
go
the
better
it
will
be
with
the
clear
glass
bottle
and
everything
give
me
a
newspaper
and
a
comfortable
chair
and
id
be
happy
just
to
sit
there
and
sip
old
speckled
hen
all
afternoon
long
likewise
a
few
of
these
along
with
some
grub
over
a
sunday
afternoon
footy
match
would
do
the
trick
when
it
comes
down
to
it
whether
solitary
relaxation
or
social
shindigs
english
ales
like
this
are
a
perfectly
suited
drink
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
unobtrusive
mildly
carbonated
overall
a
reliable
albeit
somewhat
unremarkable
english
pale
ale
its
good
but
i
know
there
are
others
out
there
calling
my
name
i
dont
know
what
the
deal
is
with
nitro
beers
but
all
of
them
taste
the
same
to
me
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
because
they
all
taste
good
just
get
kinda
boring
after
a
while
i
mean
i
know
nitro
is
supposed
to
make
the
beer
more
creamy
and
it
does
but
i
wish
that
creaminess
didnt
overpower
the
other
tastes
in
the
beer
and
it
usually
does
now
on
to
the
beer
review
pours
a
very
solid
one
finger
head
very
creamy
looking
tiny
tiny
bubbles
completely
white
in
color
excellent
lacing
on
this
beer
as
would
be
expected
with
any
nitro
beer
the
body
is
a
dark
and
cloudy
amber
color
not
much
visibility
through
this
beer
at
all
not
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
at
all
at
least
from
what
i
can
tell
that
might
be
a
problem
well
see
very
nice
contrast
between
the
head
and
the
body
it
looks
really
cool
overall
it
looks
like
a
pretty
standard
nitro
beer
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
doesnt
look
awesome
very
creamy
on
the
smell
you
get
the
idea
that
its
just
really
smooth
very
nice
malt
smell
as
well
as
i
would
expect
with
a
nitro
english
beer
not
much
hop
aroma
what
so
ever
i
know
its
an
english
pale
ale
but
still
there
needs
to
be
some
hop
aroma
here
i
may
detect
hints
of
honey
as
well
which
is
strange
because
i
dont
remember
this
smelling
at
all
like
boddingtons
but
it
kinda
does
the
second
time
around
perhaps
brown
sugar
on
the
smell
as
well
overall
a
really
great
smell
needs
hops
though
even
though
it
is
an
english
nitro
beer
its
still
a
pale
ale
pretty
disappointing
on
the
flavor
you
get
a
tiny
bit
of
all
the
flavors
i
was
talking
about
the
brown
sugar
the
honey
and
some
caramel
but
its
hardly
there
like
barely
at
all
the
flavor
overall
is
just
really
bland
and
boring
its
just
all
malt
and
not
much
else
to
it
there
is
also
an
unwanted
alcohol
flavor
to
it
its
only
5
2
i
really
shouldnt
be
tasting
alcohol
i
detect
a
tiny
bittersour
taste
so
maybe
there
are
some
hops
in
here
but
it
could
also
be
a
metallic
taste
because
its
not
a
crisp
bittersour
its
just
unpleasant
overall
the
taste
is
ok
at
best
its
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
it
has
a
lot
of
unwanted
flavors
it
has
a
few
nice
flavors
it
is
very
sweet
in
some
areas
but
for
the
most
part
the
bads
over
ride
the
goods
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
for
a
nitro
beer
creamy
smooth
medium
bodied
it
has
also
no
carbonation
which
is
unfortunate
most
nitro
beers
have
very
little
carbonation
and
maybe
i
just
usually
dont
notice
how
little
they
have
but
on
this
beer
i
for
sure
did
notice
it
so
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
just
ok
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
honestly
it
should
be
higher
that
alcohol
and
bland
bittersour
taste
really
detract
from
the
drinkability
still
its
smooth
and
goes
down
well
but
overall
not
too
great
overall
on
this
beer
what
more
can
i
say
on
some
sips
it
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
flavor
and
on
other
a
very
unwanted
alcohol
bittersour
flavor
its
a
good
beer
but
very
very
close
to
being
average
and
not
a
good
beer
o
nyur
will
have
to
rereview
from
cask
this
old
speckled
hen
pours
out
as
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
on
it
the
head
settles
and
leaves
behind
just
axiom
without
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
malts
much
like
most
of
the
english
ales
ive
had
no
hops
on
the
nose
or
anything
else
really
it
smells
a
little
sweet
and
has
some
fresh
grains
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
much
full
of
rich
malts
and
just
a
slight
amount
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
the
carbonation
is
very
light
here
this
is
something
id
like
to
try
from
a
cask
i
feel
that
the
style
would
go
better
with
that
then
from
a
can
overall
its
a
decent
brew
and
worth
trying
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
with
typical
british
ale
characteristics
malty
metallic
floral
hops
etc
a
good
intro
into
european
ales
o
high
quality
ale
here
thats
the
bottom
line
o
i
still
cant
believe
this
wasnt
a
nitro
can
it
had
all
the
qualities
in
appearance
and
mouth
feel
anyways
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
simple
but
i
would
be
able
to
drink
this
all
night
d
i
like
it
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
by
the
clear
bottle
i
thought
it
was
terrible
id
try
it
again
i
suppose
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
and
now
i
have
a
few
bottles
i
really
dont
want
tastes
of
toffee
malty
sweetness
finished
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
overall
a
nice
refreshing
ale
this
should
go
well
with
nuts
or
other
salty
fare
i
will
have
this
one
again
overall
this
was
good
tasting
beer
i
thought
it
made
for
a
nice
lighter
offering
and
definitely
something
that
i
will
have
again
overall
not
much
in
this
beer
for
me
was
hard
to
get
the
last
half
down
verdict
good
beer
and
possibly
great
if
it
had
a
touch
of
carbonation
and
a
tiny
bit
of
aroma
to
it
worth
trying
a
decent
brew
one
i
wouldnt
turn
down
for
another
go
overall
it
did
come
off
more
as
a
fruity
brown
ale
rather
than
a
pale
but
it
was
very
drinkable
and
full
flavored
if
it
was
cheaper
i
would
consider
getting
it
again
but
its
pretty
pricey
for
a
non
pale
good
beer
though
ontap
pours
copper
hue
with
a
white
long
lasting
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
apples
and
pears
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
bitter
earthy
hops
with
some
apple
juice
short
unremarkable
finish
too
much
of
fruity
esters
forgettable
brew
a
lighter
bodied
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
did
enjoy
it
at
that
time
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
they
really
need
to
move
to
darker
bottles
if
theyre
going
to
export
it
across
an
ocean
final
notes
this
beer
is
alright
im
not
super
impressed
with
it
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
its
definitely
palatable
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
though
dear
god
i
never
thought
that
bastard
would
be
me
onward
and
upward
a
second
try
with
this
beer
proves
it
to
be
more
tolerable
than
the
first
still
unimpressive
and
im
not
sure
what
the
point
of
nitro
is
besides
a
dumb
gimmick
however
im
going
to
tick
this
up
just
a
bit
on
principle
d
pretty
standard
for
an
english
pale
ale
though
not
quite
as
sessionable
for
me
on
account
of
the
carbonation
half
inch
creamy
off
white
head
on
a
clear
sparkling
deep
amber
body
very
little
lacing
pleasant
aroma
and
light
initial
taste
with
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
despite
the
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
creamy
very
smooth
taste
goes
down
easily
an
interesting
but
not
especially
good
ale
worth
trying
for
what
i
at
least
perceive
as
some
level
of
novelty
doesnt
look
or
taste
like
any
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
before
outside
of
that
probably
wont
bother
to
seek
this
out
again
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
its
moderately
alcoholic
and
is
pleasing
on
the
palate
with
its
creamy
mouthfeel
it
goes
down
very
well
notes
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
traditional
english
beers
this
seems
like
a
good
example
but
i
cant
get
behind
it
would
rather
drink
tanners
jack
the
nitro
helps
and
gives
the
beer
better
mouthfeel
but
theres
some
flavors
here
that
dont
work
for
me
thus
the
low
drinkability
score
a
tasty
refreshing
and
satisfying
ale
sweet
smell
of
roasted
barley
caramel
and
malt
pours
a
dark
amber
body
slightly
carbonated
with
hardly
any
head
despite
its
appearance
this
beverage
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
brew
with
flavors
including
coffee
toffee
malted
barley
hops
yeast
and
has
a
slight
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
carbonated
watery
palate
d
highly
recommended
picked
up
a
tall
boy
for
about
1
5
us
and
would
do
so
again
overall
very
drinkable
and
nice
i
would
enjoy
a
single
malt
scotch
someplace
in
the
session
throw
in
some
beef
or
pork
and
good
times
to
be
had
cheers
i
was
happy
and
suprised
to
see
a
4
pk
of
old
speckled
hen
at
a
local
beverage
storeespecially
in
the
nitrocan
had
to
try
it
i
had
had
this
brew
once
in
the
bottle
many
moons
ago
i
confess
i
enjoy
a
good
english
pale
ale
this
brew
qualifies
in
my
book
opens
and
pours
with
the
typical
nitro
pop
and
cascade
settles
to
a
pretty
butterscotch
color
with
great
thick
head
lots
of
lacing
left
on
glass
as
the
head
remains
to
the
end
of
glass
nose
is
simple
and
has
some
honey
and
biscuity
scents
taste
is
creamy
and
of
typical
english
ale
i
picked
up
some
malt
biscuity
yeast
mineral
and
toffee
flavors
all
grew
as
the
beer
warmed
i
prefered
it
cool
to
cold
overall
a
nice
ale
and
one
i
would
return
to
occasionally
looks
rather
average
pours
a
pale
to
light
golden
head
is
thick
but
recedes
with
some
lacing
smell
has
some
toffee
or
caramel
notes
tastes
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
muted
toffee
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
drinkable
not
a
bad
pale
ale
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
ordering
again
good
but
not
overall
amazing
despite
all
the
great
qualities
ive
mentioned
im
having
trouble
actually
finishing
my
beer
it
doesnt
sit
well
in
my
stomach
and
im
beginning
to
notice
other
lesswelcome
flavours
as
it
warms
up
regardless
i
havent
changed
what
ive
written
above
because
it
was
true
at
the
time
i
wrote
it
drinks
very
well
and
leaves
a
full
malty
flavor
on
the
palate
d
a
very
sessionable
tasty
ale
d
not
bad
just
boring
drinkability
not
overly
awful
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
doubt
i
try
it
again
unless
on
tap
a
fine
enough
oldschool
english
ale
to
be
sure
stiff
upper
lip
and
all
that
but
still
just
kind
of
dull
all
things
being
relative
the
sweetness
does
go
a
certain
distance
in
allaying
the
heat
from
my
more
piquant
choices
from
the
lunch
buffet
so
all
is
not
lost
super
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
overall
a
solid
and
easytodrink
english
ale
that
should
please
most
palates
d
overly
sweet
and
skunky
with
booze
taste
wont
buy
it
again
when
they
poured
this
beer
and
handed
it
to
me
it
had
a
95
creamy
head
on
it
it
took
a
few
minutes
but
the
head
slowly
smoothed
out
into
the
beer
not
sure
if
this
had
anything
to
do
with
the
odd
taste
and
smell
pours
a
redamber
body
with
a
2
finger
head
dwindling
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
the
body
looks
quite
appealing
smells
of
toffee
sweet
hints
of
alcohol
and
biscuity
malt
tastes
of
the
biscuit
malt
along
with
a
lingering
bittersweetness
and
cooked
vegetable
flavour
resulting
in
a
very
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
but
the
finish
is
almost
too
dry
along
with
the
vegetablelike
finish
it
is
good
not
great
drinkability
great
beer
id
drink
it
again
great
pub
fall
season
beer
might
try
blending
it
with
guinness
one
of
my
favorites
available
locally
worth
a
try
thanks
to
daniel
for
bringing
this
down
cheers
mate
its
the
dogs
bollocks
i
will
be
avoiding
english
ales
in
the
future
this
was
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
would
have
again
if
available
on
tap
certainly
better
than
your
average
pale
ale
goes
down
easy
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
really
i
cant
say
enough
about
how
just
plain
pretty
this
beer
is
nice
cascading
effect
with
the
nitro
can
going
on
leaves
a
thick
and
creamy
white
12
inch
head
patiently
sitting
on
top
of
the
amber
colored
brew
aromas
of
sweet
malty
goodness
hit
the
nose
first
along
with
some
cinnamon
and
a
random
vegall
smell
that
seems
out
of
place
the
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
is
evident
upon
first
sip
followed
by
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
some
alcohol
presence
and
bitter
hops
that
show
up
just
long
enough
to
let
you
know
that
they
are
there
the
hop
bitterness
quickly
retreats
and
you
are
left
with
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
for
a
while
very
low
carbonation
in
the
beer
but
it
adds
to
the
creamy
smooth
texture
leading
to
an
extremely
high
drinkability
my
first
cask
experience
a
very
smooth
creamy
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
grass
or
iron
maybe
there
is
just
something
hiding
in
there
but
on
cask
its
really
good
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
warmer
temp
gives
it
a
nice
smooth
creamy
flavor
and
feel
you
could
definately
drink
several
but
you
need
to
enjoy
that
earthy
grassy
flavor
and
aroma
i
did
pours
a
glorious
deep
but
clear
reddish
amber
color
and
a
respectable
creamy
offwhite
head
that
unfortunately
doesnt
hang
around
long
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
in
fact
it
gives
the
impression
of
being
a
little
too
sweet
at
first
but
the
flavor
actually
has
a
nice
balance
with
a
pleasant
muddled
combination
of
toffee
caramel
and
cherries
being
held
in
check
by
a
dull
mild
and
somewhat
nondescript
hop
bitterness
the
smooth
texture
works
with
the
flavors
but
it
doesnt
necessarily
stand
out
on
its
own
overall
this
was
different
unexpected
and
quite
pleasant
crossed
paths
with
it
ontap
last
night
thought
id
give
it
another
shot
yeah
its
alright
the
pour
was
nice
fond
of
the
nitrofile
despite
a
smooth
creamy
first
look
the
head
petered
out
rather
early
and
the
sheeted
lacing
stopped
halfway
down
not
a
spotless
class
hmm
the
aroma
is
a
tad
bready
and
certainly
a
larger
degree
fruity
but
theres
a
decidedly
whiskey
quality
overall
not
just
the
aroma
but
the
color
and
flavor
as
well
reminds
me
vaguely
of
bass
maybe
but
anyway
yes
the
whiskey
edge
is
strong
a
watereddown
beer
version
of
the
spirit
decent
smoothness
in
feel
the
nitro
certainly
blandifies
the
drinkiness
and
flavortaste
this
is
an
ideal
session
or
fishnchips
et
al
pub
food
drink
notwithstanding
a
classic
beer
i
always
have
to
consume
in
significant
quantities
when
i
visit
the
english
pubs
but
the
bottled
version
is
indeed
worth
the
money
too
if
you
can
muster
it
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
in
a
bottle
but
will
most
certainly
grab
it
on
tap
if
i
ever
see
it
i
got
these
in
a
4pack
and
ill
certainly
drink
the
rest
now
that
theyre
in
my
fridge
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
especially
in
this
serving
type
again
still
a
very
nice
beer
for
a
change
bit
of
nostalgia
value
too
of
course
as
far
as
the
bottle
not
a
chance
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
a
moderate
ambercopper
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
persists
and
leaves
a
good
deal
of
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
plain
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
and
some
very
very
faint
floral
hops
the
taste
suffers
from
the
same
fate
as
there
really
is
just
not
much
to
this
one
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
drinks
well
enough
but
just
is
not
a
terribly
flavorful
or
complicated
beer
d
easy
drinking
partially
because
it
is
nearflavorless
it
tastes
very
smooth
about
the
same
as
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
hurts
still
its
nonoffensive
and
that
makes
it
drinkable
if
a
bit
overly
boring
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
carbonated
but
the
that
would
take
away
from
the
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
smooth
i
would
def
give
a
try
pours
an
amberorange
colour
with
thick
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
looks
like
a
nitrotap
but
no
widget
in
can
smells
of
huge
caramel
malt
with
faint
floral
hops
almost
no
bitterness
but
lots
of
sweetness
very
creamy
mouthfeel
a
nice
enough
beer
but
not
quite
enough
hops
for
a
pale
ale
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
sweet
gingerbread
like
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
light
and
dry
malt
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfel
with
a
small
sweet
malt
to
clean
aftertaste
kind
of
like
boddingtons
with
more
flavor
old
speckled
hen
is
a
bold
work
within
the
pale
ale
style
but
it
falls
short
of
its
ambition
not
bad
but
certainly
very
different
in
this
clear
bottle
from
what
i
remember
the
draught
version
tastes
like
certainly
a
more
manufactured
feel
to
it
here
a
very
runofthemill
english
pale
still
its
going
down
well
and
ill
probably
come
back
to
it
again
just
next
time
in
another
serving
type
pours
a
pretty
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
some
residual
lacing
smells
of
strong
hops
and
toasted
grain
a
very
well
blended
mix
of
hops
semi
sweet
malts
and
nice
grain
flavors
all
hit
the
tongue
well
mouthfeel
is
average
and
a
little
fizzy
drinkability
is
not
too
shabby
a
classic
brew
here
clear
bottle
eh
alright
fair
enough
the
beer
inside
pours
a
straight
amber
topped
by
a
thin
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
strictly
a
combination
of
rye
bread
and
walnuts
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
taste
adds
in
a
touch
of
oak
a
drop
or
two
of
light
maple
syrup
and
some
light
greenery
the
body
is
a
heavy
lightlight
medium
with
a
very
light
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
epa
nothing
eyecatching
or
budcatching
i
guess
but
tasty
enough
and
highly
drinkable
overall
i
wouldnt
rank
this
offering
above
average
in
my
quest
through
the
world
of
beer
i
chalk
it
up
as
a
learning
experience
and
will
forge
ahead
still
trying
to
find
the
ideal
version
of
this
beer
as
nitro
mutes
the
malts
and
the
clear
bottle
is
usually
a
little
off
guess
i
need
to
go
to
england
for
a
cask
beer
for
the
real
thing
and
as
for
the
chelsea
hotel
enjoy
the
ambience
from
the
sidewalk
from
a
leonard
cohen
song
or
a
virgil
thomson
composition
dont
waste
a
dollar
on
the
accommodations
d
like
most
british
beers
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
this
one
is
also
extremely
drinkable
with
being
very
balanced
good
brew
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
september
18
2010
it
pours
a
reddishamber
with
about
an
inch
of
puffy
offwhite
head
that
bubbles
downward
little
by
little
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
caramel
malts
and
molasses
seem
to
greet
the
nose
with
a
crisp
thin
hoppiness
in
the
background
there
is
a
fine
bitterness
to
the
flavor
with
a
butterycaramel
sweetness
and
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
at
the
end
very
english
i
used
to
buy
this
one
frequently
but
not
as
much
anymore
but
i
still
like
it
from
time
to
time
simple
beer
and
easy
enough
to
drink
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
olde
ship
in
fullerton
last
night
tried
this
beer
years
ago
from
the
bottle
and
thought
it
was
ok
so
lets
see
how
it
is
from
a
nitro
tap
smooth
creamy
crisp
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
kiss
at
the
finish
very
good
on
tap
hit
the
spot
for
me
and
worked
well
with
the
bangers
and
mash
i
ordered
i
could
drink
these
all
night
still
this
is
a
very
decent
english
ale
probably
one
of
my
favourites
even
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
in
general
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
sulfur
and
butter
taste
is
juicy
grapes
up
front
with
a
toasted
bread
middle
and
an
earthy
dry
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
quite
drinkable
i
would
imagine
this
is
loads
better
at
the
source
on
cask
but
in
bottled
form
its
a
pretty
good
beer
too
a
decent
beer
that
id
drink
again
especially
ontap
because
it
looks
cool
being
poured
however
i
still
like
the
bottle
version
better
while
it
may
be
good
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
too
many
of
these
overall
a
pretty
nice
english
pale
ale
havent
got
around
to
trying
too
many
epas
yet
but
theyre
most
definitely
a
different
animal
than
apas
for
those
looking
for
a
smooth
subtle
malty
pale
this
one
delivers
bought
at
the
saq
from
a
translucid
500ml
bottle
very
nice
clear
copper
colour
ale
white
head
little
retention
nice
cristal
malt
nose
with
some
roastiness
sharp
hop
bitterness
nice
flavor
little
malt
but
lots
of
hops
nice
english
style
pale
ale
drinkability
overall
the
great
mouthfeel
and
interesting
taste
makes
this
a
very
fun
beer
to
enjoy
quite
good
d
really
drinkable
i
had
this
a
little
bit
ago
for
the
first
time
and
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
the
taste
is
not
particularly
sweet
it
has
a
nice
caramel
malty
mid
section
lots
of
toffee
and
butterscotch
flavors
a
good
deal
of
drying
and
slightly
bittering
leafy
hop
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
just
a
classic
english
pale
with
the
herbal
caramels
slightly
roasted
toffee
flavors
and
the
drying
finish
there
is
subdued
sweetness
here
and
this
is
what
really
separates
this
out
from
faux
epas
as
the
beer
settles
it
really
brings
out
the
pale
malts
there
is
a
touch
of
minty
mouthfeel
to
the
beer
as
well
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
rubylike
amber
orange
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
substantial
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
fresh
cut
spring
flowers
and
caramel
sweetness
sweet
bubblegum
taste
offset
by
a
slight
bitter
hoppiness
considerable
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
light
body
quite
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
and
nice
aftertaste
a
pleasant
surprise
i
would
happily
buy
and
drink
a
sixer
of
this
brew
without
regret
poured
a
translucent
copperamber
into
a
pint
glass
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
great
guinnesslike
waterfall
and
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
toffee
caramel
apple
and
pear
the
taste
equaled
the
aroma
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
dissolve
at
the
finish
silky
smooth
feel
with
no
carbonation
excellent
lacing
and
excellent
retention
truly
an
awesome
session
brew
had
this
on
a
nitrotap
at
a
small
wannabe
irish
pub
around
the
corner
from
dba
manhattan
and
it
was
amazing
as
well
presentation
and
texture
is
key
to
this
beer
as
i
couldnt
imagine
this
beer
tasting
as
good
in
a
regular
bottle
or
carbonated
tap
d
high
delicious
bitter
i
would
drink
all
they
long
you
can
bet
it
wow
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
in
a
can
other
than
guinness
the
bottles
are
even
better
and
would
rank
a
quarter
point
higher
but
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
velvety
smooth
and
you
can
taste
the
hardwork
and
character
of
this
reddish
color
brew
if
you
happen
to
see
this
beer
buy
it
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
when
it
finally
settled
down
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
1
5
inch
head
considerable
lacing
throughout
smells
of
malts
and
hops
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
taste
is
of
caramel
up
front
the
hops
coming
out
later
slightly
sweet
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
not
exactly
hohum
as
there
are
other
english
ales
out
there
more
worthy
of
that
distinction
and
its
pretty
unique
among
other
english
pale
ales
but
im
definitely
not
crazy
about
it
old
speckled
hen
has
an
inviting
appearance
a
distinct
amber
color
and
a
foamy
head
the
ale
will
continue
to
lace
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
overripe
fruit
and
the
sweetness
of
caramel
the
taste
is
at
first
sweet
and
followed
by
bitterness
the
two
are
so
separate
that
it
cannot
be
described
as
balanced
the
texture
is
smooth
and
velvety
for
me
i
can
drink
one
glass
and
then
move
one
to
something
more
balanced
d
easy
to
drink
and
nice
however
the
flavor
is
lacking
hv
this
poured
beautifully
but
then
just
settled
to
a
average
appearance
not
much
smell
taste
average
with
a
corn
like
flavor
no
great
mouthfeel
nothing
special
happening
here
except
for
the
beautiful
initial
pour
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
english
pale
ale
can
i
add
great
lacing
throughout
all
in
all
an
ok
ale
easy
d
great
is
brew
is
easy
drinking
and
good
for
a
session
beer
no
heavy
feeling
im
curious
to
try
it
on
tap
its
interesting
and
sessionable
but
not
the
first
or
even
second
pale
ale
id
grab
for
served
fron
a
bottle
poured
a
light
amber
almost
like
a
dark
tea
color
with
a
reddish
hue
thin
foamy
head
that
didnt
last
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
character
until
i
let
it
sit
and
warm
up
a
bit
sweet
toasted
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
fruit
similar
tastes
with
sweet
malty
toasted
flavors
and
a
clean
fruity
dark
cherry
finish
easy
to
drink
although
im
used
to
ice
cold
beer
this
one
showed
its
character
when
it
was
more
at
50f
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
english
ale
d
a
very
sessionable
ale
would
be
no
problem
to
drink
this
all
evening
this
is
a
refreshing
drinkable
and
delicious
ale
the
nitro
can
serving
smooths
the
taste
considerably
pretty
drinkable
nothing
extravagant
but
still
a
good
beer
much
better
than
the
bottled
verrsion
drinkability
a
solid
nitro
pub
ale
not
much
different
from
the
guinness
and
boddingtons
of
the
world
d
well
as
most
nitrocan
english
pub
ales
this
is
a
session
beer
in
all
aspects
drink
up
and
cheers
i
havent
had
enough
epa
to
know
how
good
an
example
this
is
i
wouldnt
really
buy
this
again
but
i
would
recommend
it
d
pretty
decent
session
beer
if
youre
considering
sticking
with
epas
for
the
night
well
i
almost
suspect
that
this
bottle
was
a
bit
old
would
have
liked
more
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
overall
might
go
back
if
i
have
nothing
to
drink
in
the
pub
or
if
its
on
sale
d
i
have
to
be
honest
i
struggled
to
put
this
one
down
it
just
had
too
much
of
a
bitter
malty
graininess
to
me
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
another
and
i
thought
it
went
well
with
a
meal
it
has
an
unusual
taste
the
more
i
drink
it
and
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
it
or
not
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
a
pretty
simple
moderately
drinkable
english
pale
ale
good
ol
speckled
hen
always
on
nitrotap
at
britts
in
pasadena
just
east
of
pasadena
city
college
on
colorado
blvd
this
is
a
unique
pale
ale
most
californians
dont
seem
to
know
but
probably
should
like
afternoon
sunshine
in
a
glass
the
nitrotap
produced
an
incredibly
creamy
three
finger
lingering
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
a
mild
and
sweet
aroma
gives
way
to
an
exceedingly
pleasant
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
offering
a
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
mildly
sour
finish
neither
robust
nor
bold
nevertheless
excellent
with
food
and
always
easy
i
would
happily
drink
this
one
all
night
the
taste
is
sweet
roasty
and
freshbaked
bread
and
malt
flavors
with
gentle
hop
bitterness
are
very
tasty
mediumbodied
very
smooth
and
flavorful
old
speckled
hen
has
good
drinkability
drinkabality
is
just
average
it
does
go
down
easy
but
lacks
and
flavor
or
anything
that
would
make
me
want
to
have
it
again
as
ive
had
much
better
examples
from
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
future
outlook
not
a
standout
to
seek
out
but
a
solid
brew
to
enjoy
if
given
again
this
is
a
beer
that
i
drank
a
lot
when
i
started
getting
into
good
beer
and
i
havent
had
one
in
a
while
it
was
a
pleasant
time
revisiting
this
beer
i
prefer
this
to
boddingtons

very
smooth
medium

slightly
bitter
finish
albeit

creamy
thick

just
ok
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
the
chalky
minerals
really
come
through
in
the
taste
and
give
it
a
decidedly
british
feel
hops
are
there
mainly
in
a
bittering
role
but
do
lend
some
floral
and
herbaceous
undertones
malt
is
mildly
sweet
and
boasts
some
toffee
and
burnt
toast
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
but
not
much
of
a
detraction
drinks
pretty
nice
i
would
imagine
this
tasting
quite
a
bit
better
fresh
from
a
cask
across
the
pond
glad
i
picked
up
this
single
bottle
and
will
probably
give
it
a
go
next
time
i
see
it
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
this
is
a
very
balanced
brew
extremely
easy
going
down
and
a
case
of
this
would
be
welcome
dits
a
great
english
pale
ale
very
clean
bitterness
nice
caramel
and
biscuit
notes
followed
with
a
very
evident
english
yeast
flavor
d
i
really
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
just
too
many
disjointed
things
happening
in
terms
of
the
flavor
an
old
standby
of
sorts
think
ive
had
better
in
the
bottled
version
buy
again
no
the
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
to
balance
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
nitro
head
that
makes
a
nice
foam
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
and
quite
balanced
as
well
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
a
very
good
session
beer
i
can
drink
this
often
d
not
a
bad
little
brew
abv
is
good
and
the
mix
of
flavors
is
worth
grabbing
one
and
giving
it
a
try
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
is
light
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
to
the
beer
pretty
much
the
throwback
beer
i
remember
a
bit
more
flavorful
and
a
bit
more
aromatic
than
i
remembered
still
tempted
to
throw
back
in
a
bottle
but
i
think
in
a
glass
and
just
short
of
cold
temperature
is
the
way
to
go
notes
good
beer
with
some
interesting
flavors
not
a
lot
of
hops
so
it
turns
out
being
a
somewhat
sweet
beer
although
i
dont
think
it
is
too
sweet
or
really
malty
good
but
not
amazing
d
higher
abv
for
a
traditional
english
ale
but
not
bad
after
a
meal
smooov
drinking
light
on
the
chops
yet
showing
some
substance
to
it
the
14
9oz
can
didnt
last
to
the
end
of
the
rating
call
me
a
romantic
dreamer
but
right
or
wrong
this
is
sort
of
how
i
have
imagined
english
bitters
in
any
local
unassuming
pub
in
england
my
family
is
from
there
and
i
am
feelin
the
call
of
the
mild
tastes
like
it
smells
a
bit
of
malt
a
bit
of
hops
but
overall
very
watery
doesnt
really
leave
much
of
a
taste
in
your
mouth
i
guess
you
could
describe
it
as
smooth
but
it
doesnt
exactly
make
me
want
to
down
pints
of
it
not
dreadful
but
a
far
cry
from
some
of
the
much
better
epas
the
beer
i
had
before
this
one
was
an
arrogant
bastard
which
seemed
to
highlight
the
blandness
of
the
osh
d
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
rich
for
me
to
think
to
have
several
in
a
row
but
id
definitely
enjoy
one
or
two
i
am
interested
to
try
the
canned
an
draft
versions
for
comparison
really
drinkable
impressive
english
ale
i
could
session
this
every
day
and
not
complain
drinkability
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
this
in
the
bottle
unfortunately
the
nutskin
bitterness
doesnt
appear
to
work
very
well
overall
i
love
it
a
nice
silky
smooth
mild
beer
that
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
however
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
after
an
ipa
as
i
dont
think
i
would
taste
anything
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
though
i
prefer
english
bitters
with
a
bit
more
character
like
fullers
or
samuel
smiths
cheers
d
next
the
history
of
the
beer
is
pretty
interesting
the
making
of
old
speckled
hen
has
something
to
do
with
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
mg
car
company
ordered
a
pint
at
st
james
gate
in
jp
last
saturday
night
man
the
bartender
certainly
took
her
time
finishing
off
pouring
this
beer
took
forever
sunset
yellow
color
body
thin
white
head
finally
settles
at
the
top
smells
creamy
like
a
cappuccino
warming
and
thick
taste
was
slightly
above
average
not
a
lot
too
it
but
enough
flavor
to
be
satisfying
the
nitro
really
makes
this
beer
shine
gives
it
a
creamy
texture
that
helps
keep
each
successive
sip
just
as
thick
as
the
last
low
in
abv
helps
make
this
beer
a
great
session
choice
old
speckled
hen
is
a
mainstay
in
britirish
pub
for
a
reason
its
good
poured
from
a
335ml
bottle
a
perfect
rich
copper
color
into
a
pint
glass
barely
any
head
on
this
alittle
dissapointed
with
that
but
maybe
it
was
my
pour
nearly
no
bubbles
or
indication
of
carbonation
but
it
still
looks
inviting
smells
malty
sweet
and
tastes
of
hops
and
malt
blended
near
perfectly
sweet
but
not
intense
a
slight
bitter
a
full
rich
medium
feel
with
little
carbonation
or
liveliness
but
overall
a
very
solid
drinkable
ale
very
well
rounded
and
im
pleased
ill
be
getting
this
again
ill
be
looking
to
try
this
on
tap
also
the
color
of
this
in
the
bottles
makes
them
look
very
nice
and
interesting
and
is
probably
the
reason
for
the
use
of
clear
bottles
but
i
dont
think
its
really
worth
possibly
letting
damaging
light
get
at
the
beer
especially
a
good
beer
i
can
remember
finding
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
gingerman
in
albany
about
15
years
ago
and
being
blown
away
by
it
over
the
years
i
have
had
it
a
number
of
time
but
solely
from
the
bottle
with
not
so
great
results
was
able
to
give
it
a
try
last
evening
on
cask
at
mahars
and
once
again
was
really
impressed
brew
was
pulled
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
some
amberorange
highlights
good
sized
frothy
head
that
had
nice
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
toffee
and
caramel
slight
hop
very
impressed
with
the
delicacy
of
it
the
flavors
are
similar
to
the
nose
hops
feel
seems
to
come
out
a
little
more
nice
toffee
flavor
extremely
smooth
feel
an
excellent
english
brew
imo
now
at
5
2
abv
this
might
not
be
a
sessional
brew
but
it
sure
has
that
feel
when
its
on
par
in
price
with
our
macros
here
in
canada
its
a
pretty
easy
choice
notes
i
have
seen
this
beer
in
so
many
places
and
finally
having
one
shows
me
why
it
is
so
popular
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
notes
i
find
this
beer
incredibly
unique
and
like
nothing
ive
ever
tasted
however
it
makes
me
feel
like
im
losing
my
mind
since
no
one
else
seems
to
have
a
similar
experience
regarding
its
smellflavor
profiles
i
find
this
beer
fascinating
but
difficult
to
drink
much
of
overall
i
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
and
would
recomend
it
to
fans
of
english
pale
ales
i
know
some
people
do
not
like
nitrotaps
but
i
for
one
love
them
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
in
the
future
tasted
clean
backed
by
a
hop
tad
watery
but
overall
a
good
brew
very
creamy
in
the
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
a
drinkable
english
pale
not
exceedingly
flavorful
but
easy
to
drink
bottle
into
pint
glass
poured
a
rich
dark
amber
with
half
finger
head
with
good
lacing
aroma
of
faint
citrus
and
spice
with
no
other
real
distinguishing
notes
very
lively
in
the
mouth
but
left
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
hung
on
a
little
longer
than
pleasurable
first
time
ive
tried
this
old
standby
on
tap
the
appearance
is
a
clear
amber
copper
color
with
a
thick
and
healthy
sized
offwhite
head
and
bullish
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
fruity
bread
bright
but
light
pretty
neutral
the
taste
is
a
tart
fruity
hop
with
toffee
bread
and
sour
mash
malt
theres
somewhat
of
a
dry
finish
its
more
than
midbodied
and
very
creamy
tiny
bubbles
with
good
mouth
action
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
found
this
one
to
be
reminiscent
of
a
pilsner
because
of
its
sharp
taste
even
though
its
amber
in
color
and
doesnt
produce
a
mountain
of
head
it
has
medium
body
and
carbonation
the
sharp
taste
doesnt
last
all
the
way
through
smoothing
out
on
the
way
down
in
the
end
im
damn
confused
what
is
this
beer
suppose
to
be
d
i
can
drink
this
beer
ice
cold
on
nitro
but
from
the
bottle
is
not
to
my
liking
because
of
two
factors
perceived
skunk
and
soapy
finish
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
what
it
looks
like
but
really
we
are
after
the
taste
here
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
unequalled
in
my
opinion
smooth
distinct
refreshing
and
with
an
aftertaste
that
will
not
offend
the
inexperienced
beer
drinker
this
beer
is
one
that
i
come
back
to
very
often
and
i
never
regret
it
the
reasonable
price
it
can
be
had
for
seals
the
deal
for
me
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
med
white
bubbles
with
a
good
lacing
its
body
is
a
beautiful
amber
brown
color
with
carbonated
bubbles
rising
up
the
side
of
the
glass
i
smelled
an
aroma
of
hops
and
citrus
it
has
a
fizzy
hoppy
kinda
grainy
taste
that
starts
off
slightly
bitter
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
too
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
could
be
better
not
my
favorite
pale
this
is
the
3rd
time
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
and
still
its
just
ok
drinkability
sessionable
sure
but
more
so
any
other
way
drinkability
is
decent
for
a
cask
beer
this
is
a
bit
underwhelming
thin
and
watery
without
much
of
a
character
usually
cask
beers
are
exercises
in
subtleties
but
this
is
more
of
a
onetrickpony
without
much
of
a
trick
decent
but
nothig
to
seek
out
im
a
sucker
for
english
beers
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
not
an
elite
brew
by
any
means
but
damn
fine
in
its
own
right
great
pour
out
of
the
nitro
can
long
time
cascading
effect
big
thick
sheets
of
lace
as
you
drink
it
and
when
you
tip
the
glass
the
foam
just
stickssuspended
in
place
along
the
wall
of
the
pint
ebbing
away
as
fast
as
clouds
move
the
color
is
a
beautiful
reddish
amber
color
the
nose
offers
sweet
red
taffy
fresh
macadamia
nuts
caramel
malt
and
mild
notes
of
warm
biscuit
the
taste
is
effected
by
the
lack
of
a
mouthfeel
still
pleasant
with
caramel
honey
ginger
shavings
and
a
malty
nutty
sweetness
not
much
of
a
finish
thin
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonationstill
a
good
beer
just
pour
it
slowly
dont
try
and
make
your
head
crest
the
glass
its
too
cloying
to
be
really
solidly
drinkable
or
much
of
a
quencher
mouthfeeldrink
light
bodied
enough
carbonation
a
little
bit
dry
feeling
aroud
mouth
when
finished
enough
drinkability
worth
a
try
a
good
sessionable
beer
with
excellent
visual
appeal
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
also
not
too
bad
id
be
very
interested
in
trying
this
on
draft
or
maybe
even
cask
the
metallic
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
but
i
didnt
take
off
points
because
it
did
go
away
when
the
beer
hit
proper
serving
temp
drinkability
i
dont
think
this
brew
gets
the
credit
it
deserves
im
a
huge
fan
of
old
speckled
hen
it
smells
good
it
tastes
good
and
it
all
comes
at
a
good
price
i
dont
care
where
you
are
or
what
youre
doing
you
need
to
be
drinking
this
beer
right
now
except
maybe
if
youre
in
a
job
interview
no
wait
even
if
youre
in
a
job
interview
do
you
really
want
to
work
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
this
stuff
for
those
who
want
to
try
a
nitrotapped
brew
but
like
the
more
traditional
look
unlike
guiness
this
is
the
beer
to
get
head
settles
quickly
over
a
bronze
body
of
this
brew
this
beer
is
very
famous
but
not
because
of
the
scent
it
as
a
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
but
has
a
slightly
fruity
malt
and
hop
balance
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
red
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
mild
skunk
youve
got
to
love
clear
bottles
and
even
milder
malt
the
taste
is
has
more
caramel
malt
than
the
aroma
but
there
is
still
enough
skunk
that
it
isnt
a
pleasant
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
watery
texture
and
low
carbonation
overall
this
beer
might
be
better
if
it
werent
skunked
however
i
blame
the
brewery
for
skunking
it
by
putting
it
in
a
clear
bottle
i
might
try
this
again
and
probably
on
tap
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
otherwise
taste
metallic
taste
from
the
nitrogen
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
seems
a
little
dry
d
not
much
to
this
beer
i
dont
know
why
but
it
was
flavourless
d
overall
it
was
good
and
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
felt
a
little
heavy
after
a
few
of
these
i
had
a
couple
of
these
beers
with
some
steak
for
dinner
and
thought
it
really
enhanced
my
meal
d
would
be
better
without
the
soapyness
ok
so
the
first
thing
that
hits
is
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
cooked
veggies
a
little
bit
there
is
also
a
real
bread
taste
towards
the
end
too
the
mothfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
overall
its
fine
flavours
include
some
light
caramel
malt
some
notsonice
grassy
hops
and
finishes
with
a
lingering
noble
hop
bitterness
needs
more
of
a
malty
backbone
had
this
on
tap
at
brits
pub
in
minneapolis
it
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
thick
1
inch
cotton
head
the
smell
was
bitter
and
malty
the
taste
was
the
same
it
was
a
bitter
ale
with
metallic
hops
and
bittersweet
malts
it
slid
down
with
my
fish
and
chips
but
no
way
would
i
buy
this
beer
in
a
sixer
i
guess
its
ok
at
an
english
pub
i
will
say
we
had
a
great
time
on
the
rooftop
on
a
beautiful
autumn
night
in
the
north
land
what
a
beautiful
setting
wow
just
looking
for
a
single
with
which
to
share
my
evening
and
by
the
looks
of
this
beers
overall
scores
i
should
have
had
a
pretty
good
one
the
price
i
guess
should
have
tipped
me
off
but
i
still
gave
it
a
go
when
it
comes
down
to
it
this
beer
did
live
up
to
its
name
it
appears
to
taste
as
an
old
speckled
hen
might
pours
an
amber
copper
color
with
minimal
white
head
smell
is
some
toffee
butterscotch
a
little
bit
of
skunk
taste
is
more
butterscotch
and
toffee
some
hops
and
toasted
malt
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
but
not
in
a
bad
way
creamy
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
tastes
like
england
if
that
makes
sense
d
a
nice
beer
at
the
pub
sit
down
and
talkbeer
d
i
prefer
this
beer
from
the
bottle
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
a
nonskunked
bottle
but
only
the
can
was
available
for
this
review
m
smooth
and
creamy
start
with
diacetyl
slickness
that
transitions
to
a
slightly
course
finish
with
the
carbonation
and
dry
bitterness
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
a
tight
almost
solid
halfinch
white
head
some
lacing
but
weak
legs
during
the
tasting
nose
was
pale
malts
a
hint
of
tea
and
some
hops
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
a
lemony
quality
coming
out
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
in
body
and
creamy
smooth
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
on
nitro
however
the
tealike
flavors
coupled
with
the
lemon
character
get
in
the
way
after
a
while
clear
amber
with
a
beautifully
dense
white
head
that
disappear
into
copious
lace
nondistinct
cereal
aroma
wonderfully
smooth
mouthfeel
but
not
much
of
anything
else
that
would
make
this
beer
standout
bitter
finish
if
it
werent
for
the
nitro
this
would
be
one
boring
brew
try
with
roast
beef
sandwiches
fish
chips
mild
cheese
and
pickles
or
your
drinking
buddy
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
all
around
though
the
thinner
airy
palate
was
not
quite
up
to
par
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
that
id
have
again
though
i
wouldnt
go
on
a
wile
goose
chase
for
it
drinkability
pretty
good
a
good
session
beer
a
nice
drinking
ale
should
complement
foods
well
especially
those
that
do
well
with
drier
beers
a
drink
that
could
be
enjoyed
several
pours
over
the
evening
mfd
very
nice
mouthfeel
surprisingly
thick
smooth
woody
and
sweet
malt
finish
d
so
so
easy
going
down
the
smoothness
from
the
nitro
widget
makes
this
incredibly
quaffable
but
remains
something
to
ruminate
on
due
to
the
complexity
this
beer
displays
in
flavor
profile
a
beer
worth
paying
attention
to
my
chicks
feel
slightly
chalky
after
things
have
dried
out
but
not
annoyingly
so
when
all
is
said
and
done
old
speckled
hen
is
a
fairly
good
english
ale
pours
a
oftamber
color
scents
of
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
come
through
on
the
nose
halfdecent
head
with
some
lacing
but
goes
down
quickly
goes
down
rather
smoothly
and
has
just
below
a
medium
body
feel
a
bit
unbalanced
some
fuggles
hops
shine
on
the
back
end
a
nice
session
beer
d
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
this
one
sort
of
weird
and
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
regardless
so
i
guess
ill
go
easy
on
it
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
abv
is
manageable
carbonation
is
pretty
potent
however
making
it
somewhat
filling
astringency
is
somewhat
tiring
to
the
palette
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
smooth
beige
head
smells
slightly
of
bread
and
malts
nothing
really
strong
or
distinct
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
slightly
sweet
bread
and
bitter
hops
pretty
god
combination
could
be
a
little
bit
thicker
but
im
not
really
complaining
goes
down
real
well
good
taste
not
too
strong
definitely
an
anytime
beer
d
alright
beer
more
novelty
than
anything
the
appearance
is
the
best
part
the
taste
is
lightly
caramelly
toasted
grain
a
lot
of
leafiness
slightly
spicey
with
nuts
and
hints
of
fruit
and
pine
a
great
sweetbitter
balance
and
a
slight
spicy
leafynutty
bitterness
with
faint
earthiness
it
has
nice
light
subtle
complexity
moreover
this
beer
unlike
some
still
has
a
good
feel
from
the
nitrocan
even
if
the
underlying
body
is
somewhat
on
the
watery
side
not
only
does
is
have
the
creaminess
from
the
creamy
head
but
this
carries
down
through
the
beer
giving
a
lasting
balanced
smooth
and
creamy
texture
rather
than
leaving
one
with
a
thin
watery
body
under
the
nice
head
dvery
drinkable
pale
ale
as
it
goes
down
very
easy
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
only
had
one
of
these
wanted
another
drinkability
i
suffered
trying
to
finish
the
last
bit
of
the
pint
the
saving
grace
was
my
steak
and
guinness
pot
pie
i
had
smooth
goes
down
very
easily
and
its
kind
of
unique
i
can
dig
it
reddish
orange
in
color
it
comes
in
a
clear
bottle
so
you
get
what
you
see
good
head
that
doesnt
last
but
leaves
a
collar
while
beer
lasts
not
very
aromatic
nice
clean
crisp
slightly
malty
with
little
bitterness
i
like
but
have
an
admitted
preference
for
english
pale
ales
some
carbonation
that
leaves
a
little
bite
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
very
drinkable
a
bit
dull
but
safe
beer
clear
light
amber
body
with
a
decent
head
there
wasnt
much
to
taste
but
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
i
really
cant
think
of
another
way
to
describe
this
except
a
watered
down
beer
there
are
plenty
of
other
pale
ales
to
try
but
this
one
could
have
definitely
been
left
on
the
shelf
a
clear
copper
color
body
with
a
small
white
headleaving
some
jagged
lacing
behind
light
carbonation
aroma
is
caramel
malt
slightly
fruitylightly
spicy
and
a
hint
of
bread

ripe
fruitlightly
bittershort
finish
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
creamy
mouthfeelmedium
body
drinkable
but
nothing
special
enough
to
buy
again
overall
the
old
speckled
hen
was
nothing
mindblowing
or
groundbreaking
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
recommend
if
you
had
limited
selection
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
beautiful
color
and
smell
the
taste
is
good
but
for
me
it
is
a
beer
to
have
for
a
quick
drink
or
maybe
something
with
bbq
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
d
tastes
like
its
made
to
drink
a
lot
of
not
the
most
amazing
of
flavors
it
is
just
an
ale
a
good
ale
with
a
definite
sweetness
to
it
but
nothing
outstanding
in
any
way
slightly
buttery
i
am
again
reminded
of
a
few
whiskeys
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
on
the
thin
side
d
nice
casual
brew
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
but
not
a
wowing
taste
drinkability
alcohol
never
seems
to
play
a
part
in
this
beer
refreshing
and
rather
easy
to
drink
drinkability
perhaps
one
to
strictly
stick
to
draft
or
possibly
the
nitro
cans
it
certainly
has
potential
but
initial
skunk
and
lingering
metal
are
a
real
turnoff
d
good
but
a
bit
bitter
pours
a
seethru
light
brown
with
a
solid
onefinger
head
that
slowly
dies
and
leaves
some
lace
patches
on
top
of
a
grassy
smokey
smellingbeer
with
light
roasted
malts
and
some
minor
sweetness
like
honey
a
pleasurable
blance
of
a
smooth
slightly
creamy
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
citric
hops
and
caramelized
malts
with
a
hint
of
roasted
and
toffee
malts
as
well
finishes
slightly
dry
with
some
herbal
tealike
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
bit
of
breadi
and
woodiness
nothing
complex
but
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
i
could
sip
on
all
night
just
an
average
pub
ale
to
drink
if
nothing
else
is
around
i
would
not
recommend
it
but
much
worse
could
be
had
drinkability
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
but
i
really
just
did
not
fall
in
love
with
it
sadly
enough
pale
ales
are
one
of
my
variety
style
and
this
was
just
a
let
down
i
wish
i
could
say
i
would
be
okay
with
sessioning
this
beer
but
with
the
dry
finish
this
is
not
a
thirst
quenching
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
d
very
very
easy
to
drink
i
have
no
complaints
whatsoever
about
the
smoothness
and
balance
of
this
pale
ale
would
be
hard
to
find
a
more
balanceddrinkable
english
pale
i
will
return
d
i
had
one
at
lunch
and
i
dont
think
ill
ever
order
it
again
it
wasnt
terrible
just
not
my
thing
i
will
say
that
the
taste
and
smell
are
the
weak
points
but
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
just
about
right
to
nearly
perfect
i
would
easily
reach
for
another
old
speckled
hen
on
a
hot
day
i
could
make
this
my
lawn
mower
beer
without
a
problem
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
but
if
one
is
offered
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
its
better
than
any
macro
whether
domestic
or
foreign
overall
not
bad
d
it
goes
down
easy
overall
it
was
good
but
touch
over
priced
for
me
being
in
college
and
all
but
worth
a
try
as
a
side
note
it
has
a
cool
bottle
design
cask
is
definitely
the
way
to
do
this
i
just
read
the
style
blurb
and
i
now
realize
its
the
hard
water
that
causes
the
cold
watery
mouthfeel
review
edited
accordingly
d
decent
not
extremely
drinkable
as
it
starts
feeling
a
little
heavy
after
a
while
md
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
light
carbonation
smooth
creamy
and
excellent
drinkability
good
for
a
session
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
a
bit
off
the
beaten
path
and
its
not
bad
for
a
single
sample
however
this
isnt
a
beer
you
have
more
then
once
its
a
bit
too
expensive
its
a
bit
off
and
while
it
is
unique
that
doesnt
make
it
good
worth
one
shot
not
much
more
i
applaud
the
effort
even
if
it
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
50
cl
clear
glass
bottle
pulled
from
the
back
of
the
stores
shelf
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
coppery
color
that
almost
seems
a
bit
pink
slight
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
bready
nutty
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
aroma
improves
as
it
warms
flavor
leans
toward
the
malt
side
of
the
spectrum
even
a
little
sweet
without
getting
a
heavier
mouthfeel
fruitness
of
the
yeast
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
definitely
sessionable
can
see
where
this
would
benefit
from
being
served
from
a
cask
all
in
all
a
pleasant
truetoform
english
ale
most
notable
for
a
rather
dry
finish
despite
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
flavor
d
this
beer
has
some
decent
attributes
but
it
didnt
wow
me
in
any
way
not
terrible
not
great
d
i
would
not
turn
one
down
it
tasted
different
from
other
pale
ales
ive
had
and
that
alone
might
make
me
buy
more
dark
copper
with
a
slight
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lace
just
above
the
head
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
toffee
with
some
faint
skunkiness
they
still
use
a
clear
bottle
and
fruity
hops
mild
sweet
malt
and
buttery
toffee
with
toasted
bread
and
english
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
balance
skunkiness
fades
after
a
few
minutes
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
decent
drinkabilitya
good
if
not
almost
verygood
beer
could
be
a
bit
bolder
on
the
flavor
but
otherwise
quite
nice
really
nice
as
a
nitrotap
d
overall
quite
refreshing
ive
definitely
enjoyed
the
remainder
of
the
sixer
left
here
by
one
of
my
buddies
a
couple
weeks
ago
d
a
nice
beer
overall
nothing
offensive
just
smooth
all
around
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
fizziness
is
a
plus
with
this
one
and
might
be
the
tipping
point
for
a
drinkability
standpoint
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
wasnt
expecting
much
but
got
alot
more
a
fairly
decent
brew
with
some
good
qualities
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
on
tap
with
nitro
is
really
the
only
way
to
enjoy
this
beer
in
the
us
anyways
there
are
other
beers
that
have
this
characteristic
but
its
important
with
this
one
a
simple
fun
brew
to
enjoy
a
few
of
even
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
but
will
not
last
too
long
if
you
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
did
pours
from
the
bottle
a
clear
orangeyamber
with
about
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
at
first
smell
a
bit
of
skunk
alarmed
me
but
perhaps
it
was
the
grassy
herbal
notes
and
my
wariness
of
the
clear
bottle
playing
a
trick
on
me
also
noticeable
was
a
milky
maltiness
i
taste
a
lot
of
buttery
caramel
malt
but
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
hops
all
of
which
leave
the
mouth
feeling
a
little
sticky
on
the
whole
a
nice
affordable
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
crystal
clear
dark
gold
color
wihth
a
slightly
off
white
head
the
nitrus
can
was
deffinitely
a
good
call
weswes
the
aroma
has
a
good
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
not
much
else
maybe
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
the
light
body
and
the
nitrus
carbonation
make
it
seem
a
little
too
flat
despite
the
head
that
wouldnt
die
not
a
bad
beer
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
a
very
nice
rounded
beer
d
i
might
try
again
to
see
if
it
is
just
this
bottle
or
if
it
is
supposed
to
taste
this
way
drinkability
i
personally
think
this
tastes
like
budweiser
with
a
kick
very
light
and
indistinguishable
for
me
i
would
not
turn
this
down
but
will
not
be
picking
this
up
conclusion
its
ok
nothing
special
mediocre
english
pale
i
expected
to
be
less
impressed
than
when
i
had
it
on
cask
at
the
george
canning
camberwell
but
i
was
a
little
unprepared
for
just
how
lame
it
turned
out
to
be
made
it
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
before
i
concluded
its
best
use
would
be
to
pass
through
my
apartments
plumbing
if
i
encounter
a
fresher
sample
on
cask
id
try
this
again
otherwise
drinking
this
beer
has
been
the
beer
equivalent
to
the
old
saying
you
can
never
go
home
again
drinkable
yes
but
not
really
for
quaffing
i
dont
think
too
sticky
really
nice
with
food
id
happily
drink
it
again
but
i
prefer
innis
gunn
and
fullers
verdict
old
speckled
hen
is
a
solid
but
generally
unexciting
beer
nice
enough
flavor
profile
very
sessionable
and
has
the
brilliant
creaminess
that
you
get
with
a
nitrocan
if
youre
looking
for
something
in
a
nitrocan
besides
guinness
and
boddingtons
you
wont
go
wrong
here
drinkability
weak
one
is
enough
one
is
enough
for
a
long
time
d
nutty
flavor
overall
sweetness
and
gentle
bittering
finish
that
let
the
tastes
linger
a
bit
was
very
enjoyable
pours
a
very
warm
orange
brown
color
with
a
tight
knit
half
inch
pure
white
cap
very
nice
cascading
effect
gotta
love
the
show
that
the
nitro
can
puts
on
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
twiggy
grain
hints
of
sugary
sweetness
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
flavor
nearly
mimics
its
aroma
it
leaves
my
palate
wanting
some
more
balance
i
find
it
too
sweet
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
body
add
more
to
this
balance
issue
a
crisp
hop
bite
would
surely
change
this
beers
character
for
the
better
light
in
overall
body
low
carbonation
and
a
decent
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
i
dont
think
it
would
ever
classify
as
a
go
to
for
me
though
drinkability
nothing
really
excited
or
put
me
off
about
this
beer
i
like
to
have
it
every
now
and
then
but
will
usually
go
for
other
craft
offerings
d
this
is
a
nice
english
pale
ale
i
could
have
done
without
the
initial
skunky
aromas
but
they
eventually
subsided
into
the
background
and
left
a
nice
very
drinkable
if
somewhat
substellar
brew
poured
a
translucent
coppedhued
reddish
amber
color
into
a
pint
glass
aroma
is
light
mostly
musty
grassy
hops
and
caramel
malt
undertones
taste
is
a
nicely
balanced
blend
of
lightly
bitter
musty
hoppiness
and
slightly
sweet
caramel
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
low
carbonation
levels
and
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
nothing
stands
out
in
a
major
way
in
this
ale
but
it
remains
true
to
the
style
and
is
an
easy
drinker
recommend
trying
would
purchase
again
d
not
so
much
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
unique
macro
brew
that
is
certainly
better
than
average
i
think
ill
get
this
once
in
a
while
as
it
is
a
good
average
session
brew
i
like
this
ale
yet
the
special
flavours
make
me
not
want
to
drink
it
too
often
a
few
pints
a
year
is
enough
3
m3
d
different
from
the
cask
version
the
body
is
way
too
thin
and
doubled
by
the
sour
fruity
edge
on
average
its
not
bad
but
requires
a
richer
body
to
round
off
the
overall
flavour
and
its
5
2abv
better
on
cask
overall
a
good
decent
and
balanced
standby
which
i
really
enjoyed
on
tap
recommended
mfd
i
find
that
the
good
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
makes
of
for
its
lackluster
taste
and
seems
to
cover
it
up
now
in
reality
that
shouldnt
need
to
happen
but
in
turn
it
does
make
the
beer
nice
to
drink
this
is
a
mild
mannered
middle
of
the
road
offering
not
a
bad
session
ale
at
all
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
a
four
pack
of
these
some
night
and
going
to
town
on
them
better
than
boddingtons
the
only
other
bitter
in
a
nitro
can
ive
had
to
compare
directly
to
overall
decent
ale
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
an
english
pale
ale
though
d
a
must
drink
for
all
beer
enthusiasts
i
hope
to
taste
it
on
cask
some
day
drinkability
was
good
would
like
another
please
smells
malty
with
a
slight
nuttiness
has
that
traditional
earthy
and
almost
old
basement
taste
to
it
drinks
really
easy
but
bubbles
seem
nonexistent
on
palate
i
could
definitely
have
another
or
two
this
one
was
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
had
tried
not
only
did
i
enjoy
the
brew
but
all
of
my
friends
enjoyed
the
brews
tasted
as
welll
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
smooth
but
this
beer
was
very
red
in
colour
it
happened
to
be
a
really
good
beer
i
will
definatley
be
a
part
of
this
one
again
drinkability
great
session
beer
had
this
one
from
the
can
with
the
accompanying
widget
poured
a
light
copper
color
with
fluffy
cascading
white
head
aroma
was
not
a
dominant
feature
of
this
beer
but
it
had
notes
of
caramel
toffee
and
wood
flavor
was
about
the
same
with
hop
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
was
good
drinkability
was
good
as
this
goes
down
with
little
effort
the
whole
of
this
beer
seemed
to
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
on
tap
i
was
somewhat
skeptical
at
first
a
beer
that
looks
orangebrown
then
i
gave
it
a
smell
not
bad
at
all
diacetyl
perhaps
well
something
sweet
and
fruity
like
a
good
riesling
in
any
case
it
was
a
delightful
session
beer
that
i
am
sure
to
have
more
of
in
the
future
looking
forward
to
trying
it
from
the
bottle
cheers
to
the
old
speckled
hen
this
is
a
very
pleasant
brew
pretty
good
balance
makes
it
an
easydrinker
doesnt
really
amaze
you
with
complexity
or
bursts
of
flavour
but
its
nice
nonetheless
i
poured
this
off
tasting
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
amber
colored
and
poured
a
tan
head
with
nice
bubbles
however
the
head
did
not
last
long
the
smell
was
bland
and
the
taste
was
bitter
and
very
flat
or
stale
musty
tasting
i
will
not
buy
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
that
is
was
necessary
with
the
clear
bottle
this
brew
has
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
thicker
12
inch
head
the
settled
into
a
nice
cap
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
an
unusual
observation
was
larger
bubbles
leaving
holes
in
the
cap
much
larger
than
seen
in
most
brews
the
aroma
is
definitely
hop
heavy
but
the
smell
is
not
overpowering
there
are
hints
of
some
citrus
and
floral
notes
along
with
some
mild
sweetness
the
taste
is
above
average
but
lacks
the
bite
i
enjoy
in
a
pale
ale
this
is
much
simpler
and
isnt
as
aggressive
despite
the
larger
bubble
holes
in
the
cap
the
carbonation
was
on
the
light
side
also
disappointing
to
me
this
was
a
decent
brew
that
i
could
sip
on
for
a
while
but
for
the
import
price
can
find
better
like
it
d
not
bad
i
could
have
another
if
i
were
so
inclined
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
so
i
probably
wont
very
drinkable
when
served
this
way
ill
have
to
check
it
out
in
bottle
form
maybe
this
is
what
mung
tastes
like
not
a
big
fan
of
english
bitters
but
my
father
brought
this
home
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
the
clear
bottle
is
an
immediate
turnoff
the
aroma
follows
suit
horribly
skunky
so
much
so
that
it
blocks
out
any
discernible
beer
aroma
the
beer
looks
alright
though
rust
colored
with
a
medium
lasting
head
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
horribly
skunky
nothing
really
here
i
really
need
to
get
this
brew
on
tap
and
rerate
the
clear
bottle
was
awful
dry
beer
pours
hazy
gold
with
a
big
white
head
straw
stale
dank
aroma
with
a
sugary
metal
somewhat
sour
but
not
in
a
good
hoppy
way
has
a
mild
flavor
that
is
tough
to
pin
down
kind
of
like
hay
but
not
in
a
bad
way
it
leaves
you
a
little
disappointed
but
not
enough
to
complain
overall
a
medium
bodied
beer
i
thought
ita
was
a
tad
bit
watery
there
is
no
finish
a
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
on
draft
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
i
will
say
that
this
beer
taste
radically
different
on
tap
not
a
big
fan
of
this
out
of
a
tap
but
it
is
excellent
in
a
bottle
a
pub
i
used
to
frequent
several
times
a
week
used
to
have
this
on
draught
about
10yrs
ago
i
have
missed
it
as
a
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
lower
hop
but
nice
malty
finish
i
always
got
a
decent
pour
and
have
only
ever
had
slightly
skunked
occasions
from
the
occasional
bottle
for
my
first
review
this
was
a
tough
one
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
but
i
would
definatley
drink
this
brew
again
i
tried
this
one
out
of
the
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
the
lcbo
anyway
pours
out
a
nice
golden
orangey
color
looks
real
nice
just
screams
tastey
ale
smell
is
also
good
smells
of
floral
hops
and
malt
real
nice
this
is
a
really
tastey
brew
nice
and
bitter
and
smooth
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
then
the
hops
kick
in
very
nice
i
docked
the
mouth
5
because
to
me
it
felt
watery
and
not
full
i
was
rather
surprised
at
this
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
good
once
its
at
optimal
temperature
it
really
goes
down
nice
and
keeps
sucking
in
you
for
more
of
this
delicious
brew
good
stuff
highly
recommended
d
from
a
different
planet
than
the
bottle
this
nitro
can
is
still
as
good
but
in
much
much
different
ways
this
ale
makes
me
wanna
party
not
my
favorite
i
had
this
with
bbqed
chicken
green
beans
and
potatoes
and
it
hit
the
spot
pours
with
the
cascading
bubbles
like
a
guinness
can
to
leave
a
lightish
brown
body
that
is
clear
with
a
perfect
white
frothy
head
pleasant
malty
aroma
with
a
little
caramel
the
if
is
a
little
weak
but
not
bad
either
decent
malt
background
leading
to
a
boderately
bitter
aftertaste
very
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
prefer
a
little
more
lively
carbonation
and
hoppier
flavor
d
i
liked
it
but
everything
seemed
scaleddown
nothing
stuck
out
as
a
particularly
strong
flavor
or
characteristic
easy
to
drink
just
a
little
boring
d
quite
good
will
do
drink
again
there
is
some
good
here
with
old
speckled
hen
but
nothing
really
noteworthy
and
given
its
high
price
this
beer
will
likely
get
a
pass
from
me
in
the
future
overall
not
bad
might
want
to
try
it
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
sometime
i
am
not
a
real
big
fan
of
nitro
cans
overall
tried
it
next
very
drinkable
flavorful
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
very
solid
everytime
ive
had
this
on
tap
ive
enjoyed
it
avoid
the
clear
glass
bottles
it
comes
in
everytime
ive
tried
it
in
that
form
resulted
in
disaster
its
got
a
fairly
smooth
taste
drink
this
one
cold
because
as
it
warms
it
gets
rather
wretching
due
to
the
malt
forward
sweetness
chewy
and
kinda
light
mouthfeel
an
okay
toffee
caramel
flavor
is
there
and
the
finish
can
get
a
bit
bitter
which
is
nice
as
a
whole
its
just
not
a
very
outstanding
brew
and
the
clar
bottle
gives
some
funly
flavors
due
to
getting
lightstruck
drinkability
pretty
good
for
this
not
refreshing
by
any
means
but
a
good
beer
to
have
every
now
and
then
could
have
a
couple
of
these
at
once
without
a
problem
a
14
9
ounce
can
of
old
speckled
hen
with
the
wonderful
widget
inside
pours
an
amber
color
with
waves
of
microscopic
bubbles
agitating
furiously
about
each
fighting
for
its
eventual
spot
in
the
dense
cap
of
foam
which
forms
and
then
leaves
a
trail
in
its
path
on
the
way
down
a
husky
grain
aroma
complemented
by
subtle
earthy
tones
smooth
and
uncarbonated
on
the
palate
flavors
of
husky
malt
but
sweet
as
well
more
subtle
hops
provide
a
semblance
of
balance
this
beer
is
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
english
ales
and
this
is
a
fine
one
i
think
id
like
this
one
a
lot
more
in
a
bottle
or
on
nitrotap
a
good
english
ale
from
the
nitrocan
i
imagine
it
would
be
unimpressive
from
a
standard
bottle
the
higher
abv
seems
a
little
out
of
place
with
this
light
beer
still
within
session
range
overall
a
nice
ale
from
the
mother
country
peculiar
enough
to
be
interesting
yet
normal
enough
to
be
enjoyed
412005
saw
someone
else
order
this
at
a
local
bar
and
it
immediately
interested
me
because
i
hadnt
tried
it
yet
i
thought
i
had
tried
everything
there
several
times
sampled
out
of
the
can
so
it
poured
an
amber
body
with
a
very
thick
longlasting
head
similar
to
a
pour
of
boddingtons
creamy
with
a
caramel
maltiness
flavor
bitter
and
relatively
smooth
something
just
wasnt
quite
right
with
it
though
overall
a
decent
beer
and
i
want
to
try
it
again
and
figure
out
what
exactly
i
think
was
missing
i
like
this
beer
after
a
delightfully
woody
start
it
is
much
more
hoppy
than
the
nose
suggests
with
an
almost
minty
fresh
bite
accompanied
by
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
enough
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
to
avoid
being
overpowering
a
hint
of
the
raisin
i
identified
earlier
on
lingers
on
the
tongue
once
the
bitterness
has
completely
subsided
this
beer
packs
a
big
punch
for
the
style
and
thus
has
to
be
well
worth
investigating
the
taste
however
is
not
fruity
at
all
cobnut
with
a
hint
of
smoked
almond
and
lots
of
charred
wood
teak
basswood
nice
bitterness
however
a
bit
sourly
had
on
tap
at
the
sierre
grille
this
had
a
great
great
appearance
really
extra
creamy
head
that
was
an
inch
or
two
thick
head
colors
were
a
clear
dark
amberish
gold
color
frothy
aromas
of
creamy
biscuit
aspects
with
a
slight
spice
to
it
the
taste
was
awesome
with
a
sweet
and
spiced
flavoring
to
it
slight
malt
mixed
with
roasted
coffee
hints
mouthfeel
was
excellently
creamy
helping
the
flavors
really
come
out
overall
a
fantastic
drink
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
its
orangish
hue
with
nice
lingering
head
is
very
appealing
and
unusual
the
nose
is
subtle
but
distinctively
malty
the
taste
is
also
mostly
malty
with
a
caramel
sweetness
that
is
very
satisfying
and
is
accentuated
by
the
smooth
and
thick
mouthfeel
a
wellbalanced
lingering
hop
bitterness
finishes
it
off
for
such
a
rich
ale
this
is
pretty
drinkable
as
well
a
nice
choice
for
an
evening
with
friends
as
the
sun
sets
interesting
beer
with
some
nicely
unusual
aspects
aroma
is
extremely
pleasant
very
flowery
and
sweet
with
some
bitter
overtones
pours
creamy
with
a
nice
cascade
effect
that
leads
to
a
light
amber
medium
copper
color
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
medium
lacing
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
the
finish
is
decent
flavor
is
weak
compared
to
the
awesome
aroma
but
it
is
pleasant
dominated
by
a
sweet
maltiness
there
is
a
nice
subtle
bitter
finish
being
a
true
english
ale
this
one
is
rather
nice
old
specked
hen
poured
a
nice
light
amber
with
one
finger
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
light
but
malty
taste
was
loads
of
malty
sweetness
with
an
ok
hop
bight
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
and
nice
drinkability
was
nice
with
good
balance
a
good
english
pale
pub
ale
always
satisfying
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
malty
english
ale
no
problems
enjoying
multiple
bottles
in
one
sitting
think
ill
pass
next
time
drinkability
a
rich
ale
that
is
a
joy
to
drink
on
draught
cant
wait
until
that
next
trip
to
the
uk
overall
a
pretty
nice
and
well
done
british
ale
went
down
pretty
easy
with
a
mess
of
creamy
foam
from
the
head
clinging
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
good
change
of
pace
from
overcarbonated
beers
and
inyourface
craft
brews
definitely
would
get
this
one
again
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
english
ale
to
go
back
to
this
the
nitro
can
version
of
this
drink
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
superior
to
the
bottle
in
almost
every
way
i
can
think
of
in
the
world
of
olde
a
solid
epa
and
not
bad
from
the
nitro
cans
in
te
past
i
always
had
from
their
clear
bottles
a
friend
i
had
not
seen
in
10
years
brought
then
over
and
i
am
now
guiding
him
through
the
american
craft
beer
selection
on
tap
at
the
rose
crown
palo
alto
served
in
a
tall
old
speckled
hen
glass
superb
presentation
orangeamber
with
that
creamy
nitrohead
nice
clarity
once
it
settles
with
constant
racing
bubbles
armoas
of
toasted
grain
and
carmel
malt
full
malt
flavors
with
an
initial
sweetness
thats
pulled
back
into
line
by
a
subtle
bitter
finish
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
perfect
companion
to
fish
and
chips
this
is
what
beer
should
be
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
prefer
it
on
the
nitrotap
i
feel
that
is
how
it
is
meant
to
be
the
charged
can
is
also
a
great
pour
you
need
to
be
careful
with
the
glass
bottles
because
they
tend
to
very
susceptible
to
skunking
hen
is
a
lighter
side
refreshingly
simple
beer
it
does
not
have
a
lot
of
fancy
flavor
just
all
around
good
16
9
oz
can
poured
a
brilliant
deep
amber
color
and
a
soft
creamy
head
that
laced
all
over
the
glass
while
drinking
drank
this
one
strait
out
of
the
cooler
and
the
aroma
was
quite
subdued
at
first
but
after
warming
up
revealed
a
subtle
bouquet
of
cararmel
and
bitter
hops
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
at
first
but
cleaned
up
nicely
after
a
few
more
sips
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
clean
respectable
beer
but
not
enough
hoppiness
for
what
id
expect
from
an
esb
or
pale
ale
id
be
interested
to
see
if
the
same
results
came
from
the
bottle
experience
probably
wouldnt
stick
out
among
a
larger
list
of
imports
but
its
in
the
top
half
for
sure
a
true
session
beer
drinks
down
well
line
em
up
pale
orange
color
with
a
creamy
hed
on
top
aroma
is
faint
with
a
little
creaminess
as
for
the
taste
its
a
bit
earthy
and
sweet
like
butterscotch
hard
minerals
are
noticable
and
the
theres
some
drying
husk
for
a
brief
moment
very
creamy
mouthfeel
one
which
i
dig
of
these
nitro
infused
pale
ales
and
sessionable
this
beer
did
the
job
washing
down
a
plate
of
bangers
and
mash
and
certainly
the
draft
is
a
safer
pick
than
picking
up
a
clear
bottle
of
it
at
a
beer
store
notes
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
i
would
have
it
for
free
i
think
it
is
over
rated
drinkability
is
very
good
as
the
bottle
will
finish
quicker
than
you
believe
this
is
a
truly
satisfying
ale
d
pour
me
another
i
like
pub
ale
nitro
for
the
win
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
drinkability
is
good
as
well
so
smooth
i
could
enjoy
one
of
these
all
day
i
feel
this
beer
could
fit
almost
all
weather
and
circumstances
as
well
poured
a
light
amber
color
minimal
head
which
passed
quickly
light
carbonation
smelled
of
floral
sweet
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
maybe
its
better
across
the
pond
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
here
would
drink
again
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
the
beer
was
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thin
foam
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
line
pretty
quickly
i
was
unable
to
discern
a
strong
aroma
other
than
a
hoppy
malt
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
smell
it
had
a
fairly
good
malty
biscuit
like
taste
on
the
front
that
finished
with
a
mildly
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
overall
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
special
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
for
an
english
pale
the
brew
is
light
brown
with
a
tan
head
a
clean
nose
of
mild
malts
and
some
quiet
floral
hops
the
taste
is
primarily
malt
based
but
has
some
soft
bitter
hops
a
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
a
good
pub
ale
and
likely
better
on
tap
note
this
beer
is
always
served
at
room
temperature
or
slightly
below
at
most
english
pubs
if
and
when
i
ever
go
back
to
england
to
visit
i
wouldnt
snub
my
nose
at
this
brew
in
a
pub
unless
its
too
over
priced
with
the
crap
thats
going
on
over
there
with
the
jacked
up
beer
prices
poured
a
brilliant
deep
amber
color
and
a
soft
creamy
head
that
laced
all
over
the
glass
while
drinking
taste
was
a
bit
metallic
at
first
but
cleaned
up
nicely
after
a
few
more
sips
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
clean
respectable
beer
but
not
enough
hoppiness
for
what
id
expect
from
an
esb
i
would
not
recommend
this
or
try
it
again
d
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
succession
the
flavor
is
acceptable
and
balanced
though
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
light
body
and
dry
finish
really
beckons
you
to
keep
on
drinking
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
anything
with
too
much
rye
is
bound
to
throw
me
off
could
compliment
a
bland
meal
very
well
though
served
by
nitro
tap
to
try
and
approximate
cask
ale
i
assume
amber
colored
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
lasts
longer
than
the
liquid
leaves
some
really
thick
lacing
the
nitro
really
gives
it
a
good
look
smell
is
toffee
and
toast
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
an
earl
grey
finish
thats
quite
dry
a
little
watery
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
but
awfully
flat
the
nitro
giveth
and
the
nitro
taketh
away
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
remember
liking
this
when
i
had
a
bottle
of
it
so
ill
have
to
give
that
another
go
before
i
write
this
brew
off
overall
bland
almost
flavorless
avoid
14

ounce
draught
nitrocan
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
almost
an
inch
creamy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
is
very
good
the
aroma
isnt
very
strong
but
i
can
smell
some
toasted
malt
bread
and
caramel
finishes
a
little
bitter
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
compared
to
the
aroma
its
nutty
theres
also
caramel
floral
hops
bread
and
some
butterscotch
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
very
creamy
and
smooth
drinkaiblity
is
good
too
its
easy
to
drink
and
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
i
think
this
is
a
decent
brew
its
worth
a
try
not
too
bad
at
all
this
was
a
very
creamy
nitrogen
draught
like
guinness
but
an
ale
instead
of
a
stout
it
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
creamy
white
head
it
had
a
very
nice
amount
of
bitterness
and
a
well
balanced
flavor
it
was
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
most
similar
to
and
better
than
a
boddingtons
drinkability
is
truly
almost
exceptional
i
find
myself
rushing
to
take
another
sip
and
then
another
and
then
another
this
is
definitely
a
beer
ill
find
myself
calling
for
and
searching
out
it
wouldnt
be
one
that
id
rend
life
and
limb
for
so
perfection
misses
out
good
for
an
english
ale
not
out
standing
but
good
will
keep
this
one
on
hand
for
poker
night
with
the
buds
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
get
hooked
on
beautiful
copper
colour
in
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
effervescence
a
very
plesant
fresh
bread
nose
when
sniffed
creamy
blond
head
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
mouth
feel
is
short
when
drunk
i
enjoyed
subtle
fruit
followed
by
a
good
hint
of
malt
a
good
bitters
finish
along
with
it
being
dry
and
crisp
a
very
nice
beer
to
enjoy
a
chat
with
a
pal
d
if
not
for
the
widget
this
would
have
a
below
average
drinkability
with
a
no
thrill
factor
not
the
best
out
there
but
worth
a
try
d
nice
smooth
easy
going
brew
very
nice
id
say
this
would
be
a
sessionable
pale
and
it
is
one
that
i
will
revisit
recommended
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
sweet
very
pleasant
for
a
finish
this
beer
was
a
very
average
english
pale
ale
nice
amount
of
hops
but
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
the
appearance
was
good
smell
was
slightly
bitter
and
like
i
said
the
taste
was
bitter
as
well
i
could
only
have
one
of
these
i
dont
think
ive
ever
realized
but
i
prefer
ipas
to
epas
i
enjoyed
the
amber
color
in
the
clear
glass
bottle
this
ale
poured
nicely
and
left
a
creamy
head
it
had
a
pleasant
slightly
hoppy
smell
and
was
extremely
drinkable
nothing
too
exciting
here
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
already
a
good
session
ale
the
clear
bottle
allows
examination
of
the
color
which
is
a
nice
clear
amber
sweet
malt
and
caramel
on
the
nose
on
the
palate
it
is
quite
sweet
a
touch
of
the
belgian
about
the
finish
which
is
not
so
much
to
my
taste
malty
and
caramel
restrained
in
the
hop
department
very
drinkable
this
was
one
smooth
beer
its
something
you
could
enjoy
all
night
without
the
taste
of
your
typical
corn
and
rice
macros
im
usually
picky
with
pale
ales
but
this
one
was
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
im
impressed
with
this
english
ale
the
old
speckled
hen
is
certainly
on
my
list
of
brews
to
tap
into
again
sometime
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
it
is
a
little
too
watery
in
the
taste
and
little
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
i
will
probably
end
up
drinking
it
again
though
because
it
is
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
and
i
do
like
english
pales
easy
to
drink
easy
to
session
this
beer
serves
its
purpose
well
mine
was
from
a
clear
bottle
and
skunked
fairly
badly
but
it
opened
up
and
faded
a
bit
otherwise
sweet
malt
smell
pours
rich
amber
with
medium
lasting
head
taste
was
malty
smooth
caramel
with
light
carbonation
and
basically
no
bitterness
decent
especially
if
fresh
im
sure
but
this
was
just
barely
ok
d
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
a
good
example
of
a
nitrobitter
that
could
keep
you
content
for
the
night
d
a
definite
keeper
this
beer
has
a
subtle
complexity
that
kept
me
going
back
when
you
need
to
take
a
palate
and
mental
break
from
inyourface
hop
bombs
intoxicating
triples
and
challenging
imperial
stouts
old
speckled
hen
is
the
perfect
vacation
i
think
its
worth
a
try
when
im
really
in
the
mood
for
a
good
english
ale
i
would
grab
this
of
course
if
i
want
something
darker
i
grab
a
sam
smith
oatmeal
stout
or
nut
brown
ale
d
very
refreshing
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
max
oaky
maybe
three
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
recommend
but
there
are
many
many
better
beers
on
the
market
for
your
money
good
effort
overall
good
flavor
and
outstanding
drinkability
make
for
a
pretty
good
epa
not
the
best
example
but
worth
checking
out
decent
price
too
d
this
would
be
easy
and
quaff
several
pints
in
an
evening
low
abv
makes
it
a
good
session
brew
from
the
bottle
this
pours
a
nice
light
copper
body
with
a
thin
yet
resilient
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
throughout
the
pint
glass
the
smell
is
rather
sweet
with
a
honeylike
presence
that
is
not
evident
in
the
taste
at
all
conversely
the
taste
is
rather
bitter
with
a
strong
coppermetallic
presence
there
is
also
a
fairly
present
sherrywinelike
taste
at
the
finish
that
continues
to
linger
into
the
aftertaste
finally
tried
this
not
wowed
but
not
turned
off
by
it
either
although
i
did
not
do
this
i
think
this
would
be
much
better
if
paired
with
food
this
pale
ale
did
not
strike
me
as
being
anything
other
than
a
bit
above
average
however
it
was
rather
easy
drinking
and
had
a
very
perfected
hop
profile
that
stood
out
on
the
palate
but
allowed
the
malt
tastes
to
remain
its
a
good
ale
and
id
recommend
it
d
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
makes
up
some
ground
in
this
category
drinkability
i
drink
this
one
as
often
as
i
can
i
just
love
the
unique
flavors
of
this
beer
d
the
drinkability
is
good
allthough
i
dont
think
i
could
ever
make
a
solid
session
out
of
these
it
has
a
syrupy
quality
that
comes
out
after
a
few
and
makes
it
a
bit
satiating
i
could
do
about
3
of
these
though
not
bad
decent
and
drinkable
an
ok
session
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
and
abv
are
fine
for
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
enough
probably
would
be
more
drinkable
if
i
liked
it
more
pretty
basic
and
straight
forward
not
something
id
seek
out
d
this
a
good
english
seesion
with
a
bit
more
abv
than
most
this
is
something
that
i
would
like
to
try
on
cask
but
there
are
others
that
i
enjoy
more
but
an
ok
beer
none
the
less
body
is
light
and
very
creamy
due
to
the
nitro
pour
somewhat
thin
and
watery
but
super
easy
to
drink
a
mellow
anytime
beer
pours
a
brownish
amber
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
i
think
i
feel
like
i
am
taking
a
whiff
of
a
macro
flavor
is
good
nice
and
hearty
but
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
bitter
edge
to
it
at
too
many
points
feel
is
a
bit
of
a
clogging
carbonation
but
a
decent
enough
liquid
overall
pretty
drinkable
it
is
what
it
is
and
this
is
basically
more
mass
produced
ale
than
anything
a
sort
of
nutty
amber
color
with
a
creamy
nitro
head
that
is
a
very
light
beige
aroma
is
butter
cookies
and
cream
with
a
little
biscuit
malt
taste
is
mild
caramel
toffee
and
orchard
fruit
with
a
little
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
most
nitro
brews
are
quite
creamy
and
soothing
the
general
texture
and
flavor
makes
me
wish
this
was
a
cureall
for
stomach
problems
it
was
a
shame
i
only
received
one
in
the
basket
but
there
were
several
other
of
the
style
that
i
will
try
this
weekend
d
a
big
time
session
brew
its
light
in
body
and
alcohol
content
but
its
got
some
pretty
complex
flavors
going
on
and
the
mouthfeel
is
downright
amazing
plus
it
looks
really
nice
in
a
glass
creamy
to
be
sure
but
finishes
a
touch
watery
considering
hardly
any
carbonated
feel
although
thats
permissible
for
something
mimicking
a
real
ale
drinkable
without
a
doubt
and
i
enjoyed
revisiting
a
style
that
i
used
to
indulge
in
frequently
during
my
beer
infancy
poured
fron
nitro
can
into
english
pint
glass
poured
a
cascade
of
gold
amber
and
white
that
finally
settled
into
a
gold
amber
color
with
thick
cream
like
foam
smell
is
light
stale
biscuit
with
slight
yeast
odor
followed
by
a
even
fainter
earth
hop
aroma
taste
is
slightly
bitter
without
much
of
the
hop
taste
and
slight
burnt
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
body
and
thin
but
because
of
the
nitro
holds
a
semi
satin
finish
this
beer
while
not
the
best
english
pale
ale
is
not
that
bad
and
is
really
a
easy
beer
to
drink
this
beer
is
quite
different
from
what
i
usually
drink
but
i
would
enjoy
another
one
it
is
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
but
gives
you
some
interesting
flavors
if
you
wait
for
them
you
have
to
hold
the
beer
in
your
mouth
a
little
bit
for
the
entire
flavor
to
come
through
amber
color
with
a
tint
of
red
makes
it
an
interesting
color
already
it
has
a
nice
white
head
that
is
fairly
thin
it
has
a
very
sweet
aroma
and
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
iced
tea
almost
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
though
until
the
aftertaste
it
starts
out
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruity
taste
overall
a
nice
break
from
different
beers
the
aftertaste
is
very
smooth
and
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
all
around
as
well
definately
recommend
this
d
this
beer
goes
down
nicely
i
like
this
beer
i
would
recommend
that
they
stop
selling
it
in
clear
glass
though
its
too
good
of
a
beer
for
that
flavors
of
butterscotch
caramel
sawed
wood
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
surfaces
midway
and
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
clean
feeling
and
easily
consumable
it
leaves
a
favorable
impression
but
isnt
too
suprising
or
bold
slightly
above
average
but
worth
a
try
d
horrible
this
was
just
about
undrinkable
i
seem
to
recall
the
canned
version
being
a
lot
better
but
it
has
been
a
long
time
they
should
never
have
put
this
in
a
clear
bottle
d
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
sure
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
certainly
a
well
balanced
one
probably
the
best
canned
beer
ive
had
its
certainly
a
good
beer
very
smooth
just
missing
some
of
that
bite
that
i
like
in
a
pale
ale
drinkability
une
bonne
bière
dans
le
style
pale
ale
poured
out
of
the
can
nice
and
had
a
nice
reddishgolden
appearance
and
an
all
right
head
it
also
had
a
pretty
good
scent
interesting
with
a
sharp
tang
to
it
the
initial
taste
is
fine
but
as
it
got
to
the
very
end
of
each
draw
there
was
a
sharp
tang
of
whiskey
it
may
be
how
its
aged
but
i
personally
dont
think
the
beer
should
be
over
ridden
by
such
a
powerful
and
unbeerlike
flavor
i
dont
think
ill
try
it
again
although
someone
who
enjoys
bourbon
a
lot
more
than
me
may
really
enjoy
it
pours
a
pretty
reddish
gold
with
a
very
nice
constant
white
head
aroma
is
mellow
sweet
malt
with
caramel
and
light
fruit
notes
taste
is
mellow
as
well
light
sweetness
apple
and
other
fruit
flavors
just
a
touch
of
hops
are
noticable
in
the
finish
very
low
bitterness
nice
flavor
overall
if
a
bit
muted
mouthfeel
is
creamy
pretty
drinkable
interesting
and
a
good
beer
overall
d
light
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
a
couple
during
an
indians
game
a
regular
for
me
overall
not
something
i
would
want
again
it
poured
a
medium
brown
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
for
long
it
had
a
very
fresh
smell
and
to
my
untrained
nose
there
seemed
to
have
an
almost
fruity
characteristic
to
it
the
smell
was
very
pleasant
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
an
air
freshener
that
smelled
like
it
the
taste
is
a
little
malty
with
some
subtler
notes
towards
the
end
that
seemed
a
little
like
apricot
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
with
a
middling
amount
of
carbonation
id
say
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
i
cant
imagine
myself
enjoying
it
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
at
a
time
im
not
in
love
but
i
think
i
definitely
fell
on
the
positive
side
of
the
fence
with
this
one
ill
definitely
have
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
sometime
chestnut
brown
with
flashes
of
red
a
few
large
bubbles
on
pouring
settled
quickly
not
much
head
but
some
lacing
starchy
smell
a
bit
of
pine
carbonation
barely
visible
taste
is
bitter
some
yeast
a
shot
of
tartness
here
and
there
thin
mildly
hoppy
mouthfeel
swirling
produced
a
milky
way
over
most
of
the
glass
surface
crisp
malty
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
fine
ale
but
doesnt
really
distinguish
itself
in
any
particular
way
not
a
bad
brew
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
too
many
not
too
shabby
a
nice
clean
simple
ale
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
and
enough
hops
to
dry
and
tarten
up
the
experience
pours
a
bright
amber
color
that
leaves
more
lace
than
i
expected
some
caramel
sweetness
in
the
nose
that
is
mostly
clean
and
fresh
the
clear
bottle
worries
me
but
clearly
this
fellow
hasnt
been
mangled
by
light
exposure
this
is
the
sort
of
brew
one
tends
to
think
of
when
going
out
to
grab
a
pint
or
two
this
brew
doesnt
make
it
into
my
regular
rotation
but
id
easily
take
this
before
a
macro
lager
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
impressive
though
thick
and
syrupy
just
the
way
i
like
my
beer
very
mellow
too
this
was
easily
drinkable
and
i
could
suggest
it
to
a
lot
of
people
i
think
would
really
dig
it
i
dont
think
its
for
just
anyone
though
despite
how
mellow
it
is
and
the
low
abv
its
a
good
pub
beer
ill
probably
be
getting
it
again
i
tried
this
beer
on
reccomendation
from
sam
matson
at
red
white
and
brew
in
florence
nj
it
poured
to
a
pint
glass
real
smooth
its
taste
is
typical
of
the
european
ales
that
i
have
tried
i
am
not
sure
about
the
availability
elsewhere
but
red
white
and
brew
just
brought
it
back
so
i
know
i
will
be
buying
it
it
is
a
beer
that
i
have
told
lots
of
people
to
buy
and
they
have
echoed
my
sentiments
d
very
high
very
balanced
creamy
smooth
resonating
with
caramel
to
open
your
eyes
overallthis
is
one
of
my
favs
and
i
highly
reccomend
trying
this
one
very
good
with
a
sandwich
and
some
hot
mustard
and
nibbling
on
some
strong
cheese
hell
this
one
is
good
anytime
pours
a
reddish
bronze
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
dusting
of
a
head
some
skunky
smells
overlay
everything
with
some
orange
marmalade
and
crystal
malts
as
the
base
on
the
palate
sweetness
and
orangey
malts
come
in
initially
then
some
hop
bitterness
hits
with
a
snap
along
with
a
hard
water
flavor
thats
rough
but
short
of
burton
toward
the
end
the
skunkiness
comes
out
comprising
the
majority
of
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
hop
bitterness
and
light
to
medium
in
weight
light
carbonation
even
for
the
bottled
style
overall
this
is
alright
i
would
prefer
a
brown
bottle
or
a
nonnitro
can
though
d
one
or
two
of
these
is
all
i
could
drink
or
would
want
to
drink
for
that
matter
drinkability
one
is
good
enough
for
me
d
with
a
smell
and
taste
this
noxious
i
cant
see
anyone
asking
for
a
second
poured
from
a
12oz
clear
bottle
with
no
dating
system
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
clear
orangeamber
color
it
had
a
good
sized
white
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
collar
good
carb
and
slight
lacing
the
aroma
was
not
very
good
started
off
skunky
then
grew
into
a
weird
smell
that
i
cant
pin
down
some
herbal
hops
the
taste
was
also
not
very
good
i
had
this
several
years
ago
and
hated
it
thought
id
give
it
another
try
and
see
if
i
had
grown
into
it
big
nope
just
isnt
for
me
dont
recommend
2
5
na
ml
n
drinkability
i
could
most
likely
drink
just
this
for
a
night
and
be
okay
this
is
an
old
favorite
i
havent
had
in
a
long
time
it
pours
a
beautiful
clear
copperybrown
with
just
a
little
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
flavor
is
richly
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
not
complex
but
smooth
and
very
satisfying
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
or
at
a
party
or
with
good
friends
looks
like
a
bottle
of
copper
fox
whiskey
in
the
clear
glass
container
poured
gorgeous
copper
in
the
glass
perfectly
clear
with
a
nice
though
small
head
that
disappeared
quickly
not
much
in
the
nose
other
than
a
mild
english
malt
but
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
satisfying
with
great
if
relatively
invisible
carbonation
taste
was
all
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
end
not
too
sweet
very
refreshing
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
the
glass
got
low
and
the
ale
warmed
but
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
good
call
on
tap
wonderful
example
of
the
style
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
and
malty
like
a
good
esb
should
taste
very
smooth
slightly
sweethoppy
i
paired
this
one
up
with
a
light
sandwich
honey
smoked
turkey
lettuce
and
tomato
on
a
crossant
and
it
was
a
perfect
fit
nothing
outstand
about
this
beer
however
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
esb
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
appearance
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
reminded
me
of
jolly
old
england
just
a
good
looking
ale
gold
to
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
lacing
of
billowy
head
to
top
it
off
smell
was
of
malt
sweetness
with
various
fruits
maybe
apricot
and
pear
it
tasted
like
a
consistently
good
old
english
ale
sweetness
from
the
malt
was
balanced
just
right
with
a
touch
of
hops
probably
kent
goldings
just
a
glancing
of
fruityness
along
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
rather
light
what
youd
expect
from
an
ale
overall
this
was
just
a
great
english
ale
reminded
me
of
the
old
country
could
definitely
make
this
a
great
session
brew
if
i
could
just
get
it
more
easily
plus
you
gotta
love
the
name
poured
from
a
widgetcan
it
gave
the
usual
widget
effect
to
the
appearance
thick
creamy
head
the
beer
was
clear
amber
colored
maybe
just
a
hint
of
haze
to
it
the
aroma
was
neutralish
mildly
malty
if
anything
and
the
flavor
was
malt
nothing
exceptionally
rich
just
a
good
session
beer
with
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
and
rich
flavor
very
impressed
with
all
the
english
and
scottish
imported
ales
ive
tasted
lately
and
recommend
trying
some
feels
awesomely
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
pours
a
deep
orange
brown
color
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
head
but
what
is
there
is
white
creamy
and
lacy
smells
spicy
floral
hoppy
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
without
much
carbonation
there
overall
its
very
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
ill
spend
the
premium
price
on
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
that
was
very
enjoyable
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
could
have
easily
had
many
more
of
it
paired
very
well
with
my
ubiquitous
corned
beef
reuben
with
fries
and
i
could
see
it
paring
with
any
standard
pub
fare
or
a
very
mild
cheese
i
recommend
this
and
would
definitely
seek
it
out
again
nitro
can
pours
with
a
frothy
tan
head
very
creamy
the
bodys
a
rich
mahogany
nose
is
slightly
metallic
sweet
with
dark
fruits
raisins
some
plums
finishes
with
a
bready
edge
like
saltines
taste
opens
far
from
the
back
with
soft
bitterness
wrapped
up
in
a
grapelike
sweetness
the
middle
is
flat
to
me
without
much
progression
and
it
closes
on
a
very
thin
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
as
light
as
the
style
should
be
but
still
too
light
almost
airy
for
my
liking
drinkable
for
sure
da
good
mild
beer
this
is
sessionable
and
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
pretty
good
worth
a
try
a
nice
esb
ok
drinkability
i
liked
this
but
i
wish
the
taste
impressed
me
more
ill
have
to
have
it
again
soon
overall
i
like
it
i
will
drink
it
again
but
i
hate
the
clear
bottles
with
an
odd
paint
job
and
not
some
barnyard
fowl
brits
are
wierd
this
beer
poured
with
a
cascading
effect
from
the
widget
it
settled
into
a
deep
copperbrown
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
malt
characteristics
in
the
background
this
is
a
malty
beer
that
has
enough
hops
to
keep
it
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
this
is
a
smooth
beer
which
goes
down
easily
making
it
a
nice
session
choice
a
pale
ale
creamy
mouthfeel
at
first
later
becomes
quite
watery
goes
down
real
easy
great
session
beer
d
easily
accessible
and
a
sessionable
bitter
with
sweet
creaminess
and
nice
spicy
hop
dashes
i
would
luv
to
try
this
fresh
on
cask
overall
a
very
refreshing
english
pale
ale
d
definitely
a
sub
par
english
pale
ale
i
think
this
might
have
to
do
with
the
age
of
the
bottle
i
purchased
primarily
lacking
characteristic
malt
presence
needed
for
balance
mediocre
flavor
doesnt
get
too
much
in
the
way
of
drinkability
pours
a
clear
whiskey
color
with
a
egg
shell
two
finger
head
that
holds
to
a
quarter
inch
and
good
lacing
to
the
finish
smell
is
of
fresh
mint
and
herbal
aromas
taste
follows
the
same
with
a
hint
of
toffee
malt
and
medium
hop
finish
mouthfeel
smooth
and
balanced
smell
and
taste
were
unusual
to
me
but
not
in
a
bad
way
need
to
try
again
to
really
see
about
drinkability
footnote
looked
on
their
website
and
they
claim
that
in
the
premium
bottled
beer
sector
old
speckled
hen
even
outsells
newcastle
brown
ale
440ml
nitro
can
pours
with
a
billowing
white
head
and
the
classic
cascading
nitro
bubbles
color
is
an
amberhoney
color
smells
very
much
of
yeast
or
bread
tastes
of
pale
malt
with
metallic
notes
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
unfortunately
not
nearly
hoppy
enough
for
my
tastes
some
extra
bitterness
wouldve
been
nice
i
suppose
its
a
fine
example
of
the
style
but
id
prefer
something
with
a
bit
more
flavour
would
love
to
give
this
beer
a
second
chance
if
i
knew
it
wasnt
tainted
it
shows
great
potential
its
a
nice
english
pale
ale
but
i
get
the
feeling
that
it
loses
a
lot
being
in
a
nitro
can
has
a
bit
of
a
personal
significance
attached
to
a
nowdeceased
family
friend
so
i
might
get
it
again
for
that
but
otherwise
id
probably
hold
off
until
i
could
get
it
from
a
cask
i
can
see
this
being
good
in
a
cask
but
as
a
skunked
bland
pale
ale
its
not
too
fun
to
drink
the
aroma
is
a
nosefull
of
skunk
and
the
taste
is
dull
slightly
sweet
malt
with
mellow
bitter
kick
punctuated
by
more
skunk
avoid
the
bottles
of
this
ill
try
it
again
when
im
on
the
proper
side
of
the
pond
for
this
beer
a
pretty
decent
pale
ale
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
your
beers
malty
sometimes
nitro
tends
to
really
kill
off
some
of
the
flavors
in
a
beer
but
in
this
case
it
works
alright
the
pale
malts
show
off
pretty
well
but
theres
a
slight
cigarette
ash
taste
that
i
could
have
gone
without
flavor
fades
quickly
after
each
sip
as
the
body
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
that
being
said
it
is
a
nitro
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
id
have
no
hesitation
about
trying
this
ontap
if
given
the
opportunity
heavy
engliish
hop
flavors
with
some
roasted
malt
balance
but
the
aftertaste
is
all
bitter
metal
not
so
good
this
beer
has
an
unidentifyable
sourness
to
it
that
i
just
cant
abide
mouthfeel
is
okay
and
this
beer
slowly
grows
on
me
as
i
drink
it
but
not
enough
to
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
why
one
of
these
when
you
could
have
a
royal
oak
or
london
pride
pours
light
copper
with
a
white
head
that
is
short
lived
has
a
toasty
malt
smell
taste
is
sour
and
nutty
the
mouthfeel
is
bitter
and
dry
esspecially
at
finish
carbonation
is
low
which
added
to
the
drinksbility
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
and
looking
forward
to
drinking
it
again
maybe
a
little
heavy
for
a
session
but
a
very
nice
pale
ale
ah
an
oldie
but
a
goodie
i
first
got
into
this
on
cask
when
living
in
england
for
a
year
it
wasnt
until
i
returned
home
before
i
realized
it
was
also
available
in
our
ontario
liquor
stores
its
certainly
different
bottled
than
on
cask
but
its
still
a
very
enjoyable
drink
500ml
bottle
pours
a
nice
copper
with
no
head
and
carbonation
nicely
malty
with
some
hops
in
there
as
well
i
think
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
being
my
regular
tipple
at
my
friday
pub
in
leatherhead
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
not
at
all
thin
like
some
others
ive
tried
could
drink
this
stuff
by
the
litre
easily
overall
impression
definitely
balanced
toward
the
hop
end
of
things
a
slightly
stronger
still
sessionable
beer
the
nitro
can
probably
lends
itself
a
better
offering
than
the
clear
glass
still
there
are
other
esbs
out
there
that
are
more
worthy
than
this
the
pour
into
my
sam
smith
pint
raises
a
modest
one
finger
off
white
head
that
falls
pretty
quickly
to
surface
lacing
the
body
is
a
bright
transparent
amber
the
nose
is
a
bit
malty
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
english
hoppiness
the
taste
is
quite
sour
with
hints
of
the
breadiness
from
the
nose
theres
really
not
that
much
to
it
the
mouth
is
very
light
and
the
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
for
this
type
of
beer
not
a
very
good
beer
just
another
beer
ie
pleasant
but
nothing
special
this
one
doesnt
seem
very
appealing
to
me
im
sure
its
better
in
england
when
its
fresher
the
distance
it
has
to
travel
along
with
the
clear
bottle
probably
take
this
one
down
a
few
notches
i
havent
seen
too
many
positive
responses
to
this
one
unless
its
on
tap
or
in
england
see
what
you
find
pours
out
a
stilllooking
copper
body
with
a
barely
there
head
that
eventually
settles
to
a
ring
leaving
no
lacing
some
decent
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
diacetyl
and
noble
hop
in
the
nose
but
theres
an
odd
aroma
of
rubber
bands
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
toasty
malt
then
comes
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
all
of
a
sudden
this
horrible
flavor
of
rubber
bands
comes
through
and
rides
it
out
gross
mouthfeel
is
soso
nothing
bad
nor
good
about
it
this
is
a
pretty
hard
to
drink
beer
the
rubber
bands
flavor
and
a
weird
yeastiness
make
this
hard
for
me
to
finish
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
i
think
id
buy
again
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
i
think
its
better
than
boddingtonss
but
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
got
this
bottle
from
beers
of
the
world
in
rochester
stop
by
if
youre
ever
in
the
area
and
be
floored
by
their
selection
average
looking
brew
nothing
special
here
copper
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
is
quite
offputting
smells
of
corn
caramel
and
overall
badness
smells
like
a
macro
skunky
in
a
word
taste
is
equally
unimpressing
caramel
sweet
maltiness
at
the
start
with
a
very
dry
almost
metallic
middle
that
lingers
all
the
way
through
the
finish
and
hangs
in
your
mouth
indefinitely
tastes
like
pennies
stay
away
from
this
one
save
those
precious
dollars
for
something
else
perhaps
it
went
bad
in
that
ingenious
clear
bottle
of
theirs
who
does
that
even
so
i
wont
grace
old
speckled
hen
with
a
second
visit
to
see
if
thats
the
case
adios
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
highly
carbonated
altogether
the
beer
goes
down
alright
not
a
treat
but
drinkable
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
i
see
this
sold
a
lot
of
places
so
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
foamy
head
thanks
to
the
nitro
widget
smells
sweet
and
fruity
almost
like
prunes
tastes
the
same
with
some
slight
bitterness
or
metallic
flavor
not
a
lot
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
i
am
not
impressed
im
not
sure
if
its
because
it
was
canned
or
something
with
the
nitro
widget
may
review
this
again
in
bottled
form
d
drinkable
typical
euro
pale
ale
style
bready
malt
aromas
and
flavor
with
a
very
subdued
hop
presence
slight
mineral
taste
pours
a
pale
copper
with
a
slight
head
very
easy
going
down
refreshing
better
tasting
than
others
of
the
same
style
but
not
much
here
in
the
way
of
flavor
or
imagination
solid
sessioner
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
sweet
tasting
followed
by
some
hoppiness
all
the
while
i
detect
some
white
wine
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
there
is
some
tartness
would
not
try
it
from
the
can
again
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
soso
beer
but
not
one
that
leans
towards
the
crappy
or
wonderful
side
of
the
scale
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
much
other
than
a
standard
fare
english
ale
beer
that
has
a
very
nice
color
to
it
probably
one
of
the
better
looking
beers
i
have
seen
smell
was
a
little
weak
but
rather
intersting
and
different
than
others
taste
is
smooth
with
a
hint
of
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
right
now
good
aftertaste
as
it
goes
down
very
smooth
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
row
i
believe

i
ever
gave
on
an
appearance
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
w
a
nice
almost
peachywhite
colored
head
that
was
fluffy
and
very
appealing
smell
was
subtle
nothing
spectacular
some
grass
and
nuts
or
something
hard
to
pick
it
up
tasted
somewhat
bitter
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
goes
down
fairly
easy
with
little
carbonation
enjoyable
definitely
better
in
a
can
than
ive
ever
had
in
the
clear
bottles
smart
move
to
start
importing
in
cans
i
might
actually
buy
one
or
two
of
these
on
occassion
now
a
decent
easytodrink
english
session
ale
not
very
fresh
could
be
in
transportation
and
not
overly
flavorful
still
decent
enough
to
grab
for
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
tasty
treat
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
but
if
i
see
it
and
the
mood
is
right
id
have
no
trouble
tearing
a
couple
of
these
puppies
down
drinkability
stantard
pale
ale
good
for
a
session
but
nothing
to
savour
here
average
i
feel
like
is
has
a
nice
little
english
vibe
fun
to
try
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
again
not
bad
overall
not
something
that
i
would
try
again
i
consider
myself
to
be
a
fan
of
english
pale
ales
to
date
this
may
be
my
least
favorite
i
found
the
acidic
tart
aftertaste
be
vinegarlike
and
wholly
unpleasant
d
i
was
mildly
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
was
it
is
a
nice
english
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
off
white
creamy
head
that
sticks
all
over
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
medicinal
and
metallic
that
is
slightly
buttery
and
nutty
taste
is
herbal
with
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
hiding
in
the
background
and
a
respectable
amount
of
hops
in
the
dry
finish
overall
an
average
beer
that
is
nothing
that
i
am
dying
to
have
again
the
clear
bottle
was
a
bit
of
a
negative
but
beer
pours
to
a
golden
orange
colr
with
thick
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
foam
cap
for
the
entire
bottle
and
leaves
very
good
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
and
smelled
somewhat
like
roasted
nuts
taste
was
somewhat
bitter
and
more
of
the
hops
with
alcohol
becoming
more
evident
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
at
midglass
finish
was
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
mostly
smooth
and
a
bit
dry
i
enjoyed
the
hen
decent
solid
brew
overall
very
enjoyable
ive
had
both
versions
and
i
prefer
the
nitro
over
the
traditional
a
redlike
translucent
colour
dense
and
creamy
head
very
soft
smell
of
coffee
and
malt
a
little
hop
smell
on
finish
dry
and
bitter
hop
taste
beer
is
full
on
mouth
good
for
drinking
in
cold
weather
seasons
overall
not
a
heavy
beer
not
that
easygoing
can
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
white
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
floral
malt
with
some
fruitlike
sweetness
taste
of
floral
malt
is
pleasant
with
some
faint
fruitlike
sweetness
and
some
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
standard
esb
that
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
again
poured
an
initially
clodyfrom
the
nitrogen
medium
copper
colorwith
massive
slightly
offwhite
creamy
head
beautiful
lacing
smell
is
pf
caramel
and
toffee
and
very
pleasant
taste
follows
through
on
the
smell
with
nice
caramel
and
roasted
notes
to
be
found
nice
creamy
and
full
bodied
an
excellent
brew
with
great
drinkability
good
session
beer
drinkability
it
was
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
buy
any
maybe
it
was
because
it
was
canned
i
might
have
to
find
it
on
tap
and
review
it
served
that
way
pours
a
deep
reddish
copper
with
a
decent
off
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
smell
was
pretty
much
all
sweet
malts
to
me
the
taste
starts
with
some
caramel
and
other
sweet
and
nutty
flavours
before
being
joined
by
some
spicy
hops
both
flavours
enjoyably
lingered
on
in
the
aftertaste
with
the
hops
being
more
prevalant
i
found
the
taste
enjoyable
with
adequate
complexities
and
a
nice
body
mouthfeel
was
good
sufficiently
carbonated
and
refreshing
i
found
it
struck
a
fine
balance
avoiding
being
too
syrupy
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
a
medium
body
and
didnt
feel
too
watery
i
think
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
this
one
the
beer
is
not
spectacular
but
has
a
very
decent
taste
and
holds
up
all
around
a
definite
session
beer
d
i
tend
to
lean
more
toward
the
bitter
and
hoppy
range
of
pale
ales
myself
and
this
just
didnt
quite
make
it
i
prefer
this
on
nitro
than
draft
or
bottle
as
it
gives
it
a
much
creamier
and
smooth
feel
not
real
robust
or
rich
but
goes
down
easy
drunk
among
jogging
beauties
across
the
way
from
a
toothless
bag
man
feeding
pigeons
and
gobbling
a
pudding
cup
the
flavor
was
malty
hint
of
honey
bit
of
hopsack
with
a
clean
toffee
finish
sweet
toasty
biscuit
malts
up
front
sweetness
develops
then
is
cancelled
by
bittering
that
comes
in
late
near
the
finish
finish
is
lightly
dry
and
bitter
but
overall
this
ale
is
soft
2
dimensional
and
unoffensive
not
bad
but
fair
and
that
isnt
enough
to
hold
this
bock
drinkers
interests
its
light
body
makes
it
moderately
drinkable
but
the
aftertaste
begins
to
wear
on
the
palate
quickly
it
is
considerably
improved
when
ontap
not
bad
if
its
the
best
option
in
a
pub
which
is
sometimes
the
case
but
far
from
sublime
440
ml
can
with
nitro
widget
served
in
a
nonic
after
the
pour
it
cascades
for
about
45
seconds
and
settles
to
an
unfiltered
dark
teacopper
color
with
low
carbonation
and
a
2
finger
almost
white
head
that
consists
of
insanely
small
bubbles
that
slowly
recede
and
leave
huge
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
beautiful
however
its
all
downhill
from
here
it
smells
sweet
almost
too
sweet
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
its
rather
flavorless
with
light
cardboard
caramel
maybe
some
vinous
malts
and
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
fairly
smooth
but
it
is
really
hard
to
drink
and
i
came
close
to
pouring
it
down
the
sink
i
chose
the
can
because
i
didnt
want
to
risk
a
skunked
beer
from
their
clear
bottles
but
im
not
sure
if
i
made
the
right
choice
doubt
if
ill
try
it
from
the
bottle
but
if
so
ill
post
a
review
d
tough
to
get
this
one
down
d
tasty
with
a
very
agreeable
mouthfeel
makes
a
great
session
beer
all
in
all
a
good
version
of
an
english
pale
ale
very
drinkable
and
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
for
a
pale
ale
i
mean
english
pale
ale
taste
is
perhaps
a
little
sweeter
than
i
normally
like
with
all
that
sweet
roasted
caramel
flavour
right
on
the
forefront
and
dominating
the
palate
the
pleasant
thing
is
that
the
hop
presence
is
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
would
suggest
which
offsets
the
sweet
stuff
enough
that
i
can
enjoy
it
an
enjoyable
citrusy
sourness
is
present
and
the
roasted
character
is
pleasant
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
softer
than
i
like
but
typically
british
in
that
respect
and
befitting
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
after
more
than
one
pint
this
might
get
a
bit
sweet
and
cloying
for
my
taste
d
for
cool
nights
tasty
cheeses
it
goes
on
and
on
in
my
part
of
the
world
sydney
aus
there
is
the
occasional
pub
that
will
have
this
on
tap
i
would
rather
have
reviewed
a
draft
hen
than
a
clear
bottle
ill
seek
one
out
and
update
accordingly
a
well
crafted
english
pale
flavors
are
tasty
but
not
overly
complex
a
good
session
ale
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
a
nice
english
pale
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
the
price
was
just
too
high
i
would
be
just
as
happy
buying
a
domestic
pale
ale
but
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
decent
price
give
it
a
try
an
ok
beer
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
some
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
grainy
aroma
pretty
nondescript
taste
also
pretty
nondescript
sweetbready
a
little
hops
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
most
british
beers
so
im
probably
knocking
some
points
off
for
that
it
is
at
the
lower
end
of
being
good
mdmedium
bodied
lower
carbonation
than
i
was
expecting
always
nice
but
not
something
i
pick
up
too
often
poured
a
crystal
clear
rich
amber
color
witha
thick
white
nitro
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
delicious
fruity
esters
and
a
slightly
herbal
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
very
nice
as
it
has
a
superb
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
malt
is
the
first
flavor
you
taste
it
is
a
slightly
carmelly
malt
that
is
very
smooth
from
the
nitro
then
the
hop
bitterness
comes
into
the
flavor
but
it
is
still
balance
by
the
malts
the
flavor
of
the
bitterness
is
nice
and
herbal
with
a
touch
of
a
citrus
like
taste
towards
the
end
the
malt
drops
out
and
the
bitterness
is
left
to
be
tasted
by
itself
which
to
my
taste
makes
this
a
nicely
hoppy
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
from
the
nitro
i
havent
had
this
in
a
bottle
but
after
having
this
on
nitro
i
probably
wouldnt
try
the
other
as
the
carbonation
would
have
too
much
bite
very
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
clear
bronze
with
a
thin
one
finger
head
excellent
retention
but
weak
lacing
aromas
of
toasted
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
crystal
malt
sour
nitro
tap
taste
upfront
toasted
pale
malt
sweetness
and
mild
floral
hop
flavor
semidry
aftertaste
very
fruity
and
leaves
a
buttery
diacetyl
coating
on
the
tounge
the
low
carbonation
and
medium
body
accentuate
the
slick
mouthfeel
low
hop
presence
throws
off
the
balance
slight
dryness
in
the
finish
helps
drinkability
but
the
diacetyl
is
the
only
notable
character
and
it
just
seems
kind
of
bland
overall
this
beer
to
me
is
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
unique
just
a
good
beer
beer
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
ok
head
to
start
nose
did
not
detect
much
there
taste
was
bittering
hops
with
a
slight
citrus
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
drinkability
was
definitely
ok
to
try
as
this
was
a
sessionable
beer
d
quite
nice
could
be
more
flavourful
simple
and
easy
to
drink
i
admit
to
enjoying
many
others
of
the
style
much
more
when
in
britain
but
since
this
is
all
i
can
get
on
tap
in
my
hometown
it
makes
for
a
reasonable
substitute
cheers
d
i
love
this
beer
i
always
end
up
extremely
refreshed
and
satisfied
after
putting
one
of
thse
away
im
not
sure
its
sessionable
as
its
very
filling
but
its
extremely
drinkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
simple
easy
moderately
effervescent
texture
that
feels
right
for
the
style
super
sessionable
and
thats
really
the
key
here
nevermind
swirling
and
swishing
this
one
this
heres
a
drinkin
beer
not
my
favorite
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
light
body
final
statement
one
of
my
old
favourites
i
went
to
boston
recently
and
on
my
list
of
things
to
do
was
to
get
this
on
tap
which
i
accomplished
at
cornwalls
pub
speckled
hen
is
a
mildly
hazy
copper
with
moderate
carbonation
head
is
tan
creamy
and
of
a
medium
height
aroma
is
of
sweet
lightly
toasted
english
grain
with
a
touch
of
grassiness
taste
is
also
of
toasted
english
grain
sweet
and
somewhat
earthy
herbal
hops
are
in
the
mix
and
provide
an
edge
of
fruitiness
overall
speckled
hen
provides
a
mellow
balanced
flavor
that
has
enough
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
i
had
reservations
about
trying
this
in
bottle
form
after
having
it
on
tap
in
england
unfortunately
it
taste
about
the
same
only
maybe
not
quite
as
fresh
same
slightly
overbearing
alcohol
taste
that
is
always
present
through
out
the
entire
pint
old
speckled
hen
has
won
awards
so
why
dont
i
like
better
i
think
the
judges
were
in
greene
kings
pocket
lol
d
it
was
a
bit
odd
to
see
a
pale
ale
that
pours
with
a
nitrous
swirl
but
it
was
that
taste
that
was
more
interesting
the
can
says
it
uses
a
special
yeast
to
give
it
that
unique
flavor
i
didnt
care
for
the
butter
and
butterscotch
flavors
and
they
sort
of
got
in
the
way
of
the
malt
flavors
a
bit
more
of
a
bitterness
in
the
hops
instead
of
a
green
floral
flavor
would
balance
out
the
malt
bill
as
basic
as
it
is
this
beer
will
always
be
my
go
to
my
miller
lite
so
to
speak
because
if
its
hot
out
slamming
one
of
these
is
so
damn
satisfying
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
fruity
with
caramel
apparent
and
a
metallic
note
hanging
in
the
background
taste
is
malty
with
some
odd
fruitiness
and
a
buttery
note
along
with
a
sour
finish
and
virtually
no
hops
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
flat
and
drinkability
is
acceptable
not
one
of
my
favourites
you
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
would
definitely
keep
looking
for
other
beers
to
try
rather
than
continue
drinking
these
i
was
faily
disappointed
in
this
beer
lightmedium
bodied
and
decently
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
have
these
for
breakfast
with
an
english
muffin
the
beer
emerges
from
the
clear
12ounce
bottle
a
limpid
burnished
copper
with
a
substantial
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
after
its
decomposition
leave
a
thick
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
nice
malt
sweetness
fresh
and
clean
to
the
senses
the
start
is
minimally
sweet
the
grain
profile
acceptable
and
the
top
light
finish
is
peacefully
acidic
the
hops
dainty
but
present
aftertaste
is
quite
dry
and
lingers
long
on
the
palate
been
a
long
time
since
i
sample
this
beer
and
i
certainly
think
theres
room
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
more
i
like
these
mild
beers
when
i
just
dont
feel
like
having
my
normal
over
the
top
brews
average
beer
at
best
probably
wouldnt
try
this
again
maybe
a
brown
bottle
would
be
better
than
the
nitro
can
but
i
wasnt
impressed
overall
a
good
floral
ale
light
orange
aggressive
carbonation
but
some
pleasant
taste
of
hops
a
touch
metallic
finish
good
amount
of
lace
and
creaminess
of
head
very
dry
aftertaste
have
had
mixed
results
from
this
brewery
and
it
seems
the
lcbo
have
a
relationship
so
we
see
a
number
coming
through
ok
to
share
a
bottle
dglad
i
tried
it
but
wont
have
it
again
i
am
confused
by
this
one
it
is
like
two
different
beers
in
one
started
like
a
porter
then
switched
to
a
belgian
then
finished
like
an
english
bitter
maybe
it
is
just
mei
hope
so
a
nice
one
to
fall
back
on
i
certainly
wont
refuse
it
although
its
not
an
exciter
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
from
a
440ml
nitro
can
caramel
predominates
the
aroma
caramel
is
also
present
in
the
flavor
with
some
hop
toward
the
end
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
not
bad
definitely
worth
a
try
tough
choice
here
nitro
can
or
clear
bottle
i
kind
of
like
the
nitro
thing
now
and
then
but
i
may
have
to
try
the
bottled
version
but
im
not
thrilled
they
are
putting
it
in
a
clear
bottle
thats
a
lot
of
traveling
and
potential
for
bad
handling
this
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
lots
of
lacing
left
in
the
glass
the
smell
was
fairly
hoppy
the
taste
was
bitter
but
very
smooth
there
was
plenty
of
foamy
head
to
sip
up
you
gotta
love
these
nitro
beers
i
could
drink
these
again
a
good
representation
of
the
style
one
of
many
beers
that
i
am
tired
of
passing
on
without
trying
glad
i
did
quite
pale
aleish
in
nature
moderately
bready
caramelly
nutty
and
hopped
to
balance
the
nitro
gave
a
terrific
creamy
texture
while
remaining
clean
and
refreshing
nicely
malty
and
yeasty
through
to
the
finish
lightly
estery
due
to
the
fermentation
and
hopping
adds
to
the
complexity
easy
to
drink
until
the
finish
where
a
lightly
phenolicplasticey
flavor
was
pronounced
that
made
the
swallowing
a
bit
tough
otherwise
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
english
pale
ale
i
could
imagine
throwin
back
quite
a
few
of
these
in
an
english
pub
overall
a
really
nice
pale
ale
good
aroma
and
great
balance
fault
it
lacks
a
little
body
but
hay
i
could
drink
this
to
i
fell
over
with
a
smile
on
my
face
taste
nice
maltiness
bitter
and
hoppy
caramel
like
in
a
caramel
pudding
or
like
the
topping
on
a
mcdonalds
ice
cream
although
this
beer
is
bitter
it
is
magnificently
in
balance
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
tastes
while
i
found
the
malt
to
prevail
in
smell
the
hop
bitterness
won
slightly
in
taste
nothing
too
exciting
but
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
and
maybe
even
some
medicinal
notes
id
be
curious
to
try
this
on
tap
in
england

i
wonder
if
id
like
it
more
if
i
drank
it
fresher
and
closer
to
its
home
a
decent
brew
but
not
for
drinking
in
large
quantities
weird
i
have
been
playa
hating
this
beer
for
years
and
yet
here
i
am
enjoying
a
glass
of
this
same
beer
all
those
memories
of
a
anemic
ale
that
had
off
flavours
is
no
longer
the
malty
nose
is
very
prominent
the
taste
is
full
and
creamy
hops
with
good
malt
on
the
backend
a
quality
english
ale
that
sells
for
not
a
bad
price
in
cans
no
less
sorry
osh
i
will
start
to
buy
you
again
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
its
not
impressive
by
any
means
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
another
one
of
these
not
horrible
by
any
stretch
but
also
not
noteworthy
i
guess
i
shouldve
known
by
the
fact
that
this
english
fine
ale
has
yet
to
be
reviewed
by
the
long
beach
bum
cheers
bham
uk
pours
a
dull
copper
color
with
a
head
that
quickly
dies
yellowleather
highlights
appear
when
i
hold
the
glass
next
to
a
lamp
but
no
carbonation
is
visible
smells
pretty
good
like
light
biscuity
malt
with
a
backdrop
of
reedy
hops
an
element
of
wet
paper
bag
wafts
through
but
not
enough
to
ruin
things
theres
a
slightbut
definitecidery
sharpness
right
at
the
top
of
the
nosefeel
going
down
the
taste
is
something
like
graham
crackers
or
wheat
bread
dough
with
a
suggestion
of
nectarine
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
full
of
mealy
dried
green
apple
and
bitter
earthy
hops
spilling
out
of
dusty
burlap
bags
unfortunately
the
beer
stumbles
when
the
deflatedcola
mouthfeel
catches
up
to
it
pinpricks
of
bitterness
through
the
aftertaste
arent
enough
to
prevent
things
from
being
a
watery
wash
easy
to
drink
though
if
this
were
coming
out
of
a
cask
i
could
do
a
session
of
it
i
tend
to
have
a
pint
of
speckled
hen
from
time
to
time
not
my
usual
beer
but
its
still
a
nice
solid
ale
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
there
is
a
bit
of
acidity
perhaps
attributed
to
the
fact
this
beer
comes
from
a
can
overall
a
good
session
beer
especially
with
a
meal
i
would
love
to
try
this
cask
conditioned
easy
to
drink
but
this
is
a
bit
light
in
the
flavor
department
this
would
work
well
for
eating
a
bland
dish
like
fresh
bread
or
potatoes
drinkability
is
moderate
i
will
enjoy
another
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
call
it
a
good
session
beer
in
short
some
bottles
at
least
from
the
lcbo
are
better
than
others
a
fruitty
flavor
like
a
pure
english
beer
i
try
this
beer
from

almost
a

well

5dont
bother
with
the
bottle
with
a
malty
finish
this
beer
would
be
paired
well
with
some
classic
english
eats
such
as
fish
and
chips
it
isnt
all
that
great
smell
is
just
a

smell
but
my

response

theres
plenty
of
toasty
malt
to
chew
on
and
its
all
so
smooth

for

probably
overpriced
at

places
and
there
are
certainly
better
options
on

but
this

is
not
the
best
of
its

in
my
opinion
drinkable

still
remaining
at
about
1

appealing
mixture
of

in

the

not
overly
indeed
as
it
becomes
somewhat

a

with
lots

pretty
good

would

be
better

ive
always

the

a

on

otherwise
the
taste
is
classic
english
pale

it
has
a
pleasant

with
just

keep

with

a

the

the

this

had
an

thumbs
up
overall
nice
brew
that
pleasantly
surprised
i
could
see
myself
buying
a

of
thee
again
i
think
it
is
probably
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
just
not
my
favorite
ale
if
this
was
maybe
10
ibus
less
bitter
i
would
enjoy
it
much
more
overall
i
thought
i
would
enjoy
this
more
than
i
did
it
was
a
bit
too
similar
to
the
generic
lagers
in
the
pub
to
my
untrained
palette
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
soft
but
with
some
character

gives
the
beer
a

here
how
have
i
missed
this
before
luxurious
creamy
off
white
head
from
the

tap
a
dense
clear
maple
color
underneath
it
smells
and
taste
about
the
same
a
balanced
clean
incredibly
satiating
blend
of
english
pale
malts
and
appropriate
hops
in
greater
proportion
than
i
expected
for
an
english
brew
its
got
a
nice
crisp
bitterness
after
the
grains
roll
through
and
even
notes
of
pine
forest
and
earthy
must
which
give
this
beer
impressive
depth
i
love
it
on
nitro
gives
the
body
some
life
and
drinks
like
an
old
world
classic
my
first
beer
from
green
king
here
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
lineup
this
is
a
really
nice
pub
ale
that
deserves
some
attention
a
fine
all
day
drinker
remarks
did
not
score
a

at
that

disregard
those
scores

4

great
example
of
a
british
pub
beer
four
of
five
imperials
of
this
bad
boy
and
the
world
will
take
on
a
different
meaning
youll
start
writing
poetry
and
wearing
shirts
with
lace
on
them
youll
start
referring
to
football
as
sport
well
maybe
not
those
last
two
things
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
great
beer
and
you
should
seek
it
out
and
try
it
to
answer
an
english
persons
question
is
it
nice
yes
it
is
very
much
so
my
last
beer
of
the
day
shall
be
a
nice
english
cask
ale
indeed
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlysweet
biscuit
mild
greens
and
light
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
everything
is
slightly
milder
and
theres
a
touch
of
grass
in
there
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
epa
one
that
seems
right
at
home
in
this
cask
engine
nothing
stellar
but
a
decent
drinking
beer
the
can
gives
it
a
few
bonus
points
and
its
incredibly
drinkable
but
doesnt
really
hold
up
over
the
course
of
the
16oz
can
not
hesitating
to
put
half
of
this
in
a
chorizo
and
bean
stew
pours
a
clear
dark
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruits
and
a
mild
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
on
my
list
of
gotos
dont
let
the
slightly
lower
price
fool
you
this
ale
is
great
as
i
stated
in
my
initial
review
i
did
pick
up
this
brew
again
i
must
say
i
was
utterly
shocked
when
i
took
the
first
sip
it
was
not
the
beautiful
ale
i
remembered
from
months
before
in
fact
it
was
so
horrid
that
i
was
compelled
to
pour
it
down
the
drain
a
move
that
i
rarely
make
moral
of
the
story
if
you
dont
like
it
the
first
time
i
encourage
you
to
pick
it
up
again
if
you
get
a
good
batch
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
with
an
ale
that
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
tried
i
have
to
say
with
a
bit
more
body
and
tempered
sweetness
this
could
be
an
outstanding
beer
as
is
the
caramel
sweetness
tends
to
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
and
aside
from
the
front
end
the
body
comes
off
a
little
watery
a
solid
and
drinkable
english
ale
but
less
than
it
could
have
been
can
to
nonic
pint
glass
o
good
english
pale
ale
has
the
characteristics
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hop
bitter
backbone
to
balance
it
low
on
aroma
and
flavour
hops
carbonation
is
on
spot
sweet
and
mild
beer
quite
bready
and
yeasty
although
it
is
average
in
several
aspects
it
has
its
own
personality
but
far
from
extraordinary
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
canned
british
import
i
bet
it
is
much
better
from
a
cask
though
here
in
peru
there
are
not
many
places
where
you
can
sample
beers
from
other
countries
so
when
he
had
me
between
a
place
where
european
beers
were
selling
did
not
think
twice
the
first
beer
i
tried
was
this
and
go
which
was
a
surprise
its
a
beer
with
a
strong
taste
excellent
aroma
and
rich
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
ever
since
im
sure
it
had
more
flavour
years
ago
but
my
memory
is
fading
so
it
might
not
have
changed
at
all
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
like
a
dubbel
or
something
eh
jokes
on
me
tastes
good
and
i
may
buy
it
again
o
abbot
ale
is
a
very
formidable
ale
it
brings
forth
all
that
is
good
in
caramel
malts
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
o
this
is
a
nice
canned
english
ale
greene
king
is
a
solid
brewery
that
imports
to
the
u
s
sweet
with
some
fruity
malt
and
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
the
smokey
character
pops
up
in
the
finish
with
almost
an
astringent
quality
the
carbonation
is
almost
non
existent
but
it
suits
the
beer
well
overall
this
is
really
a
good
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
im
glad
it
is
not
on
nitro
as
is
doesnt
seem
quite
as
harsh
a
great
beer
that
i
will
be
sure
to
come
back
to
again
o
not
bad
im
somewhat
conflicted
about
this
beer
i
like
the
apple
note
and
the
smoothness
of
the
lower
carbonation
but
i
feel
like
everything
is
too
flattened
out
aroma
taste
feel
and
would
prefer
a
nitro
version
if
its
going
to
be
this
flat
and
smooth
interesting
but
i
dont
know
if
id
go
back
for
another
there
are
too
many
beers
in
the
sea
to
spend
more
time
here
does
this
review
make
sense
im
not
sure
just
as
im
not
sure
about
this
beer
poured
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
small
soapy
head
light
aroma
caramel
and
light
fruits
taste
of
sweet
caramel
and
wort
lighter
notes
of
toffee
and
dried
apricot
pretty
nice
but
not
amazing
lightmedium
body
and
pretty
smooth
going
down
not
something
id
get
again
but
definitely
not
bad
o
a
pretty
big
letdown
i
dont
know
what
people
see
in
this
beer
ill
take
boddingtons
or
old
speckled
hen
in
its
place
any
day
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
i
used
it
as
a
cooler
treat
for
a
road
trip
i
probably
would
only
buy
it
for
the
same
purpose
an
outstanding
english
ale
poured
from
a
pint
can
it
poured
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
lasted
the
enitire
pint
i
wish
i
find
this
on
tap
creamy
and
rich
with
a
classic
ale
smell
zero
aftertaste
high
quality
no
doubt
ice
cold
pint
can
single
ready
to
go
from

world
in
largo
on
ridge
rd
a
new
favorite
overall
quite
tasty
and
to
the
point
drinking
up
as
she
goes
rather
nicely
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
english
pale
ale
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
there
is
nothing
absolutely
exceptional
about
the
taste
but
the
feel
is
amazing
o
easily
drinkable
simple
but
still
decently
complex
a
beer
you
can
drink
for
a
while
without
getting
tired
o
one
of
the
best
readily
available
english
pale
ales
its
nothing
glorious
but
a
great
daily
drinker
notes
clean
tasting
dry
and
mildly
fruity
this
is
a
good
english
pale
ale
too
bad
it
is
nitro
sublime
treat
yourself
o
i
love
this
beer
nothing
pretentious
just
an
awesome
classic
english
pale
ale
a
decent
but
unexceptional
pale
ale
nicely
balanced
starting
to
feel
a
little
heavy
in
the
belly
but
this
is
a
large
can
at
500ml
tasting
a
little
bit
of
the
tin
flavor
i
always
get
from
canned
beer
o
nice
and
full
perfectly
creamy
ale
extreme
sessionability
just
the
thing
to
go
with
a
hot
curry
o
a
nice
sweet
pub
ale
with
a
proper
balance
of
sweet
and
smooth
made
a
good
session
beer
at
11000
feet
under
a
blinding
sun
o
a
very
stable
and
balanced
british
ale
its
not
a
very
provocative
beer
but
its
just
so
very
wellmade
and
priceworthy
itd
be
perfect
with
for
example
pork
chops
or
when
youre
just
hanging
out
with
the
guys
ill
have
another
one
right
now
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
its
not
precisely
to
my
taste
but
it
is
drinkable
and
inoffensive
taste
ripe
plum
and
peach
soft
herbal
hops
and
buttered
bread
cheers
easy
drinkng
english
style
personified
o
in
a
nutshell
i
found
this
ale
to
be
very
much
the
same
as
old
speckled
hen
perhaps
a
little
more
hoppy
yet
with
the
same
high
quality
overall
very
pleasant
the
bitterness
is
not
overwhelming
seems
to
be
wellbalanced
the
initial
skunkiness
is
not
offputting
id
drink
it
again
this
beer
pours
out
as
an
amber
color
with
a
creamy
looking
off
white
head
the
lacing
is
minimal
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
some
grassy
caramel
sweetness
with
some
grainy
malts
in
there
too
the
taste
is
a
smooth
creamy
earth
flavors
grainy
not
much
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
not
much
carbonation
at
all
o
decent
english
pale
ale
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
the
most
o
overall
very
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
would
likely
by
a
lot
of
a
good
example
of
some
english
traits
but
perhaps
not
the
greatest
example
od
standard
quality
english
ale
highly
drinkable
and
fairly
tasty
without
being
a
knockout
overall
you
know
it
is
rather
tangy
then
bland
but
initially
tangy
overall
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
try
and
will
surely
pick
some
up
again
o
across
the
board
a
real
stand
up
english
brew
ill
definitely
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
in
the
future
o
this
is
tasty
and
good
its
one
of
the
better
english
ales
ive
had
and
might
be
better
with
a
nitro
widget
dr
it
slides
down
easily
enough
but
it
costs
too
much
give
it
a
go
d
very
easy
drinking
and
wellbalanced

does

is

the

with
a

twas
a

well
balanced

not

maybe
from
the
cask
the
head
is
almost
soapy
in

not

it
is
a
more
savory
beer
the
taste
is
fantastic
definitely
buttery
a
bit
salty
even
with
a
very
slight
toasted
flavor
like
a

i
love
it

still
buy
it

good
session
beer
all
in

this
is
a
pretty

good
epa
full
flavored
and
very
drinkable

has
a
nice
deep
copper

with
a
thin

thats
easy

enjoy
remember
this
brand
from
on
tap
in
england
i
was
amazed
to
see
the
brand
in
my
local
beer
store
beautiful
appearance
lovely
balance
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
smooth
clean
with
a
substantial
alcohol
content
and
satisfying
without
heaviness
a
fair
value
for
an
import
and
a
fine
drink
medium
body
with
a
great
cask
mouthfeel
that
is
soft
and
creamy
is
there
alcohol
in
this
surely
does
not
feel
that
way
excellent
example
of
an
english
cask
beer
glad
i
tried
a
reminiscing
beer
one
to
put
back
a
few
as
the
night
draws
on
delicious
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
absolute
best
beer
in
the
style
but
its
solid
enough
to
be
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
d
an
interesting
taste
which
makes
drinkability
suffer
a
touch
the
effervescence
was
higher
than
expected
in
an
english
brew
i
like
the
flatter
english
ales
like
caffreys
boddington
d
very
good
and
worth
a
second
pull

a
very

beer
from

mostly
dense

with
a

and
there
retention
not
an
issue
since
not
much
to
start
from
no
stick
to
the
lacing
however
it
does
slide

in
an
extremely
solid
sheet
creamy

with
a
sour

banana

and

green
apples
and

hard

candies
somewhat
floral
yet
you
cant
really
say
theres
any

bite
the
malt
seems
to
win
by
default
smattering
of
mixed
spices
stutters
too
much
mediumbodied
for
all
the
fluff
and
creaminess
cannot
achieve
deeper
mouth
presence
carrot

notes
there
as
much
as
toffee
butterscotch
or
cocoa
the
hops
are
weak
and
cannot
come
close
to
lending
spine
to
the
whole
little
bit
of
citrus
the
carbonation
is
soft
and
kind
of
a
wuss
you
get
a
very
clear
message
which
makes
you
think
it
is
as
it
should
be
allowing
for

not
this
imbibers
cup
of
tea
and
pretty
damn
glad
the
glass
is
close
to
empty
nice
creamy
carbonation
very
low
though
this
is
my
very
first
review
for
the
ba
pours
a
pale
orange
with
huge
thick
white
head
head
doesnt
want
to
dissipate
at
all
leaving
rings
of
lacing
after
sips
smells
of
floral
hops
with
toffee
and
caramel
malt
balancing
it
out
nice
bitterness
in
the
flavour
very
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
smooth
drinker
i
had
this
on
cask
last
year
and
preferred
it
but
still
enjoyed
the
can
o
nice
to
drink
but
nothing
special
drinkability
despite
the
faint
hops
and
lack
of
carbonation
this
beer
really
tastes
good
quite
impressive
d
a
good
session
ale
refreshing
but
in
my
opinion
could
do
with
less
spice
in
the
flavor
drinkability
everything
i
expect
from
a
good
everyday
english
ale
this
deserves
more
attention
in
the
us
i
think
it
sells
a
lot
in
england
on
draft
goes
down
easy
but
too
thin
to
want
to
chase
these
one
after
another
decent
flavors
odd
intensities
worth
a
try
notes
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
definition
from
both
the
malt
and
the
hops
but
overall
it
was
still
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
was
exceptionally
smooth
and
the
primary
elements
of
the
taste
mirrored
its
smell
up
front
there
is
a
pleasant
hopfloral
taste
and
a
candied
fruit
element
i
also
detected
the
trademark
diacetyl
taste
i
find
in
many
english
beers
and
the
what
i
find
to
be
delightful
taste
imparted
from
the
hard
water
the
beer
had
an
excellent
hopmalt
balance
that
made
it
easy
drinking
there
was
minimal
carbonation
that
added
to
the
smoothness
found
it
to
be
enjoyable
so
i
ordered
a
second
pours
a
cloudy
reddish
tan
with
a
very
small
amount
of
head
the
aroma
is
very
bready
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
small
hint
of
hoppy
flavoring
after
i
got
over
the
flatness
characteristic
to
the
style
the
beer
really
started
to
grow
on
me
each
sip
i
enjoyed
the
beer
more
there
really
isnt
much
aftertaste
at
all
as
i
finish
through
the
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
might
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
md
mouthfeel
is
very
flat
and
a
bit
creamy
nitro
would
do
great
things
for
this
beer
the
beer
grew
on
me
and
would
call
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
enjoy
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
refreshing
beer
for
a
saturday
afternoon
500ml
can
from
the
lcbo
pours
a

burnt
orange
with

hues
and
a

are
mild
fruit
marmalade
floral
and
metallic
hops
toffee
whole
wheat
biscuit
tangy

excellent

dryly
citric
and
crackerlike
aftertaste
theres
some
warmth
going
down
as
well
a
basic
but
satisfying
epa
similar
to
the
draught
version
of
headstrong
pale
ale
good
example
of
the
style
smells
like
some
molasses
and
a
hint
of
licorice
pours
to
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
taste
is
a
tangy
mix
of
maltiness
and
noble
hops
with
a
large
presence
of
currant
aftertaste
is
both
sweet
and
bitter
balanced
to
say
the
most
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
but
this
brew
makes
up
for
it
in
unique
flavor
if
this
brew
had
a
decent
backbone
it
would
be
quite
good
all
in
all
a
good
drinker
but
i
must
downgrade
for
the
lack
of
backbone
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
yeast
lightly
roasted
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
with
an
average
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
it
is
also
a
bit
fruity
and
astringent
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
beer
is
full
bodied
no
real
bitterness
to
detect
forward
sweetness
serious
body
no
carbonation
in
the
palate
to
speak
of
but
it
doesnt
need
it
there
is
almost
a
fruity
sweetness
in
the
midpalate
second
taste
there
is
some
lingering
malt
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
that
nearly
gives
rise
to
an
aftertaste
overall
its
an
unoffensive
decent
beer
drinkability
is
good
its
a
little
heavy
methinks
otherwise
its
fine
im
not
a
big
fan
of
epas
but
this
one
really
stands
out
from
the
bunch
ive
had
fruity
refreshing
and
an
easy
quaffer
i
think
this
would
be
great
to
have
on
tap
for
the
style
two
thumbs
up
and
definitely
recommended
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
honey
amber
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
nicely
caramel
malty
aroma
sweet
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
sweet
finish
a
very
mild
taste
very
low
carbonation
almost
reminds
me
of
a
cask
ale
very
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
taste
highly
recommend
this
one
pours
a
rather
luminous
pale
amber
with
medium
to
thick
head
that
is
rather
creamy
nose
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
cannot
detect
any
identifiable
properties
on
the
palate
theres
a
gentle
soft
malty
biscuity
flavor
with
light
hop
bitterness
for
balance
easy
drinking
and
almost
watery
in
fact
which
isnt
appealing
d
very
drinkable
could
be
quite
sessionable
and
the
touch
of
spices
and
dryness
make
it
a
bit
interesting
interesting
flavor
and
is
quite
british
the
fruity
ale
yeast
is
complemented
by
a
fair
amount
of
toffee
malts
and
mild
floral
hops
bread
dough
is
very
prevalent
this
is
a
decent
drinker
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
purchase
on
a
regular
basis
tastes
like
a
good
cask
ale
that
does
not
translate
well
to
life
in
a
can
in
all
an
average
or
above
average
beer
contains
plenty
of
character
without
sacrificing
the
easydrinking
qualities
that
make
it
so
enjoyable
drinkability
quite
high
the
lower
carbonation
can
a
good
session
offering
quite
a
bit
of
flavour
here
without
feeling
too
heavy
could
go
for
a
few
of
these
if
needed
d
good
this
is
a
good
balanced
english
pale
ale
pretty
flavourful
yet
not
heavy
one
of
my
favourite
widelyavailable
english
pales
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
draught
this
beer
was
good
enough
i
just
felt
like
i
wished
there
was
just
more
taste
to
it
or
a
richer
taste
i
guess
maybe
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
an
english
beer
they
seem
to
have
so
many
good
ones
that
come
across
the
pond
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
can
has
a
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
hoppy
bitter
and
somewhat
sour
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
it
updated
november
1809
the
latest
batch
is
in
a
can
with
puple
colour
instead
of
orange
still
a
good
beer
and
the
hops
are
now
more
identifiable
as
earthy
to
me
not
my
favourite
hopping
flavour
but
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
with
enough
character
to
keep
you
interested
but
not
so
much
that
youd
burn
out
on
it
in
theory
im
only
having
the
one
tonight
bugger
drinkability
a
perfect
example
of
how
an
english
bitter
should
be
truly
world
class
d
very
drinkable
but
i
would
expect
the
sweetness
to
become
too
much
if
several
were
consumed
in
one
sitting
d
a
really
nice
one
not
the
best
on
the
market
but
ill
buy
this
one
again
very
nice
beer
not
much
going
on
flavorwise
but
very
smooth
and
sessionable
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
with
sharp
crispness
a
little
slick
and
finally
wetting
to
the
palate
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
it
gets
a
little
too
clammy
after
a
while
light
amber
body
with
a
very
thin
white
head
maybe
it
was
just
my
nose
or
the
particular
can
i
bought
but
there
really
wasnt
any
distinct
aroma
that
i
could
smell
taste
was
fairly
simple
some
sweet
malts
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
goes
down
smooth
enough
no
complaints
there
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
drinkability
is
great
the
scent
is
a
definate
downer
but
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
how
can
a
beer
look
so
good
and
taste
so
blah
poured
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
was
quite
alot
like
wheat
and
taste
was
nothing
but
bland
wheat
this
greatly
hindered
the
drinkability
beer
was
at
least
smooth
though
sadly
that
and
its
looks
were
all
it
had
going
for
it
very
unimpressed
with
this
ale
and
surprised
it
wasnt
in
a
nitrocan
very
normal
amber
color
with
a
bare
minimal
head
after
the
pour
that
faded
into
edge
lacing
quickly
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
nose
and
maybe
a
bit
of
bread
but
so
faint
it
wasnt
bad
on
the
nose
though
just
fairly
nonexistent
about
the
same
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
more
hoppiness
coming
through
well
carbonated
and
consistent
over
the
tongue
so
it
has
that
served
in
a
guinness
pint
glass
color
is
a
clear
tanamber
with
a
thick
white
head
enjoyable
nose
that
primarily
says
malt
taste
is
an
easy
drinking
tealike
experience
a
light
balanced
hopsmalt
combination
goes
down
very
easily
and
finishes
without
an
obtrusive
aftertaste
seems
like
a
great
beer
to
drink
while
playing
darts
in
a
dark
pub
somewhere
edit
can
not
bottle
also
second
can
had
huge
head
which
held
its
own
the
extra
head
helped
me
warm
up
to
this
beer
basically
this
beer
tasted
to
me
as
good
as
boddingtons
did
the
first
time
i
had
it
on
tap
i
cant
say
much
for
boddingtons
nowadays
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
abbot
ale
is
everything
that
bdingtons
should
be
pours
a
clear
amberyellow
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malt
english
hops
slight
biscuit
and
very
slight
yeast
aromas
fits
the
style
of
an
english
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
earthy
malt
up
front
then
some
yeast
cleanliness
and
some
strong
english
hops
come
through
next
a
dry
finish
dominates
the
feel
overall
a
little
on
the
watery
side
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
i
dont
even
think
i
would
dare
to
try
this
on
tap
in
england
it
was
that
nasty
of
all
the
dreadfully
bastardized
english
bitters
ive
had
from
can
this
one
is
far
from
the
worst
offender
ill
grant
it
some
nice
distinctive
attributes
and
the
fact
that
all
considered
it
is
an
enjoyable
enough
pint
to
drink
that
said
i
really
dont
plan
on
donating
any
more
money
to
the
abbot
unless
maybe
i
go
to
england
and
meet
him
in
person
d
certainly
a
very
sessionable
and
tasty
ale
i
would
have
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
totally
fuggledup
english
ale
with
a
nice
balance
and
soft
mouthfeel
drinkability
light
and
sessionable
if
you
like
this
flavor
earthy
and
sour
qualities
are
not
for
me
a
decent
pale
ale
that
comes
in
a
can
its
nice
and
simple
but
otherwise
not
much
to
see
mfd
nothing
special
could
be
a
bit
thicker
and
a
bit
more
carbonation
same
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
recommended
for
fans
of
old
speckled
hen
fursty
ferret
etc
tastes
like
a
better
version
of
bass
to
me
overall
a
tasty
treat
from
england
overall
smooth
and
easily
sessionable
a
good
beer
to
start
your
day
with
pours
a
clear
amber
with
minimal
white
head
appear
lowly
carbonated
but
body
is
smoothly
textured
tastes
of
a
very
yummy
earthiness
loam
and
wood
sweet
malts
a
vegetable
bitterness
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
with
nearly
any
food
and
is
perfect
for
a
session
doesnt
need
to
be
super
cold
to
be
enjoyable
im
definitely
a
fan
taste
is
sweet
roasted
smokey
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
bitter
hops
great
mouthfeel
and
excellent
drinkability
esp
at
5
0
abv
great
british
brew
greene
king
abbot
ale
definitely
goes
down
as
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
this
strikes
me
as
highly
drinkable
wiuthout
ever
being
boring
the
only
risk
i
could
think
of
is
how
rich
it
is
something
to
savour
in
due
moderation
drinkability
more
an
esb
than
a
pale
ale
in
my
book
this
is
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
session
beer
d
one
of
my
favorite
styles
for
a
session
this
one
is
good
but
ive
had
better
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
d
on
the
whole
a
solidly
made
pale
ale
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
good
overall
nice
elements
i
just
wish
they
were
turned
up
a
notch
nothing
to
get
really
excited
about
very
good
flavor
and
refreshing
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
authentic
i
love
this
brew
its
just
really
fresh
and
balanced
quite
a
nice
canned
treat
d
definitely
a
decent
session
beer
low
on
carbonation
but
decent
body
goes
down
almost
too
easy
light
medium
body
light
effervescence
a
solid
british
brew
500ml
can
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
little
head
decent
malty
aroma
enjoyed
on
a
warm
night
just
after
finishing
some
work
and
before
a
downpour
started
so
i
could
be
refreshing
beer
biased
im
even
having
it
fridgecold
and
it
is
hitting
the
spot
right
now
not
complicated
smooth
upfront
with
decent
maltiness
turning
into
fruity
english
hoppiness
as
it
goes
down
better
than
i
expected
a
nice
session
brew
tasty
enough
that
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
worth
a
try
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
english
pale
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
essential
either
it
had
been
a
while
since
id
consumed
an
english
pale
ale
so
it
made
for
an
interesting
change
of
pace
my
last
beer
from
greene
king
was
old
speckled
hen
consumed
from
cask
my
first
time
from
cask
anyway
at
a
pub
on
denmark
hill
in
london
maybe
id
have
appreciated
this
more
that
way
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
session
drinking
and
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
go
back
to
as
a
standalone
beer
either
for
a
bit
of
atmosphere
i
grabbed
the
closest
athand
cd
that
happened
to
be
by
an
english
band
this
turned
out
to
be
elps
tarkus
which
is
busy
in
a
way
that
i
think
would
work
better
with
an
ipa
perhaps
thats
why
i
found
myself
wishing
the
hops
were
more
assertive
instead
of
my
palate
being
permanently
corrupted
by
west
coastversions
of
the
style
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
deep
amber
colour
and
poured
with
a
fluffy
head
which
disintegrated
within
about
5
minutes
of
pouring
the
first
taste
was
a
revelation
a
balance
of
malt
and
fruit
with
just
enough
hop
to
make
you
long
for
a
ploughmans
lunch
in
an
english
meadow
in
july
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
sufficent
zest
so
as
not
to
leave
your
mouth
feeling
as
though
it
is
coated
with
treacle
with
a
fragrant
bouquet
and
superb
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
ale
drinkability
is
excellent
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
is
nice
and
complex
yet
remains
easy
to
quaff
and
enjoy
in
quantity
a
great
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
let
it
warm
up
to
cellar
temps
and
the
flavors
really
shine
through
with
the
low
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
drinkability
smooth
mouthfeel
and
clean
finish
make
it
very
drinkable
d
i
could
go
all
night
thats
what
she
said
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
the
finish
features
the
hops
as
well
theres
a
light
tickle
of
malt
sweetness
and
its
rather
dry
mediumthin
mouthfeel
obviously
a
creamy
but
not
a
great
english
pale
im
hesitant
to
post
a
review
of
this
stuff
because
the
only
two
times
i
tried
it
were
in
the
london
gatwick
airport
and
on
both
occasions
it
tasted
as
though
this
stuff
had
been
sitting
in
the
bottom
of
the
keg
for
about
lord
knows
how
long
before
i
got
to
it
there
was
pretty
much
zero
carbonation
and
it
was
very
sour
which
leads
me
to
believe
that
i
am
correct
in
my
assumption
that
both
were
spoiled
batches
it
was
an
airport
after
all
ill
give
it
another
shot
if
i
can
find
it
in
a
store
stateside
this
brew
is
a
copper
color
and
holds
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
has
soft
sweet
malts
and
some
floral
hops
the
flavor
profile
starts
with
piney
hops
and
has
a
mild
sweet
malt
profile
light
crisp
body
is
clean
over
the
palate
a
good
english
pale
to
wash
down
a
meal
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
9
2008
after
purchasing
from
the
queens
quay
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
rusty
brown
colour
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
caramel
malt
a
little
hops
and
some
nuttiness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
with
little
carbonation
the
flavour
is
nutty
malty
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
d
good
drinkability
moderately
enjoyable
smooth
with
a
nice
clean
malting
and
light
bitterness
makes
this
good
for
a
few
a
perfect
strong
ale
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
same
qualities
noted
in
the
aroma
it
has
an
amazing
sweetbitter
quality
that
is
wonderfully
balanced
being
both
at
the
same
time
its
very
tasty
with
a
great
feel
never
bland
and
exceeddingly
smooth
and
drinkable
drinkability
nice
easy
drinking
english
pale
ale
it
poured
with
a
fingers
worth
of
lovely
ecru
head
that
experienced
good
retention
the
nose
had
a
pleasant
sweetness
to
it
like
mild
honey
or
better
yet
honeysuckle
the
color
was
a
deep
honeygold
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mild
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
slight
bitterness
but
enough
to
sustain
the
likes
of
me
id
like
to
try
this
in
an
n2
can
d
easily
drinkable
good
malt
character
though
it
may
be
a
bit
weak
on
hop
flavor
and
aroma
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
pale
ale
i
definitely
recommend
it
for
a
relaxing
relatively
low
abv
beer
1pt
9oz
bomber
was
even
more
tasty
than
the
can
drinkability
the
more
that
is
drank
the
more
it
feels
like
can
be
drank
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
likely
the
2nd
best
ive
ever
had
from
greene
king
with
the
first
being
ruddles
county
ill
be
pursuing
more
of
this
one
in
the
future
for
sure
the
beer
poured
a
healthy
amber
with
a
nice
bit
of
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
bicuity
malt
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
was
nice
biscuit
malt
and
a
clean
hop
finish
the
feel
was
medium
a
bit
wet
but
a
dry
finish
a
nice
beer
that
would
make
for
a
wonderful
session
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
in
my
opinion
enjoyed
very
much
d
this
is
a
great
session
brew
or
pub
brew
as
the
english
might
say
this
wont
floor
you
with
complexity
or
bash
you
over
the
head
with
outrageous
flavors
but
it
is
a
study
in
balance
and
pleasant
flavors
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
in
one
swift
opening
of
the
can
the
beer
pours
into
a
pint
glass
leaving
a
filtered
copperorange
with
a
creamy
head
on
top
diacetyl
and
faint
esters
make
up
the
aroma
the
taste
while
a
little
metallic
from
sitting
in
the
can
is
enjoyable
and
easy
on
the
palate
again
mellow
fruity
esters
and
a
little
diacetyl
mixed
in
after
a
couple
sips
the
metallic
taste

smooth

a
quaffers
delight
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
thing
frothy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
weak
it
lacks
character
all
around
but
some
malt
notes
are
apparent
taste
is
alright
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
with
a
mild
sweet
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
kind
of
boring
it
lacks
carbonation
drinkability
is
fairly
high
though
with
low
alcohol
levels
and
simple
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
more
as
i
drank
and
really
enjoyed
it
as
it
warmed
slightly
if
youre
not
looking
for
humongous
pale
ale
flavor
this
is
very
drinkable
found
it
enjoyable
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
in
its
homeland
give
it
a
chance
like
i
said
its
a
real
grower
with
a
surprising
bit
of
depth
for
what
is
usually
a
pretty
simple
style
would
be
perfect
to
session
drinkability
this
is
a
lovely
light
yet
flavorsome
ale
with
a
fullon
british
character
i
wish
we
could
get
more
beers
like

d
very
drinkable
my
favorite
pale
ale
so
far
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
still
a
nice
beer
with
character
and
not
too
overpowering
d
not
for
me
thanks
kind
of
onedimensional
and
harsh
good
drinkability
a
good
beer
to
fill
up
your
imperial
pint
glass
with
sit
back
and
enjoy
and
not
think
too
hard
about
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
little
brew
that
i
really
did
not
even
know
that
i
had
it
was
quite
good
and
defiantly
something
worth
taking
a
shot
at
i
would
defiantly
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
can
it
might
surprise
you
a
bit
as
it
comes
through
with
a
lot
more
quality
then
i
thought
it
would
can
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
of
malt
is
slightly
sweet
with
little
hops
distinguishable
taste
was
also
dominated
by
some
discreet
sweet
malt
with
a
dry
ending
body
was
about
average
with
some
average
carbonation
a
bit
boring
overall
and
would
have
profited
from
having
more
english
hops
to
provide
some
floral
notes
d
very
high
i
had
this
on
a
couple
occasions
in
england
and
it
was
never
very
exciting
on
tap
either
a
fairly
standard
ale
clear
amber
with
a
flash
of
cherry
depending
on
your
lighting
inch
thick
offwhite
head
kept
going
by
a
host
of
lazy
slow
moving
bubbles
sweet
smell
or
is
that
malt
smooth
mouthfeel
balanced
bitterness
citrus
overtones
fruity
with
an
aftertaste
of
tangerine
and
a
lingering
bitter
finish
hmmm
i
could
drink
this
more
often
the
carbonation
did
die
down
before
i
reached
the
end
of
the
glass
that
aroma
had
me
a
bit
mystified
it
was
musty
one
moment
and
spearmint
the
next
its
all
good
though
a
pleasant
and
satisfying
ale
all
in
all
good
but
nothing
special
a
respectable
reading
of
the
style
without
any
flourish
not
horrible
but
kind
of
average
definitely
english
though
esp
with
those
ciderlike
qualities
went
down
easy
overall
the
beer
is
appealing
but
no
qualities
that
are
outstanding
by
themselves
a
solid
quaffable
english
ale
the
beer
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
about
right
for
its
style
however
the
taste
completely
put
me
off
this
beer
i
managed
to
force
a
quarter
of
the
pint
before
giving
up
and
moving
onto
another
this
beer
obviously
has
its
fans
but
i
am
not
one
i
strongly
recommend
asking
for
a
taster
before
ordering
a
pint
pours
with
a
small
head
and
not
much
in
the
lacing
department
has
an
amber
like
colour
smells
a
bit
metallic
some
malt
but
i
cant
pick
up
much
else
my
mouth
also
has
a
hard
time
with
this
one
maltysweet
with
some
fading
earth
like
notes
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
its
no
where
near
the
bottom
drinkability
quite
nice
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
work
well
together
this
is
one
nice
brew
not
the
best
but
pretty
solid
across
the
board
nothing
to
complain
about
but
nothing
that
is
going
to
win
first
place
either
definately
not
my
style
of
beer
but
i
could
drink
a
pint
of
one
1
of
these
poured
out
of
a
can
that
i
thought
to
be
nitro
but
no
widget
a
medium
to
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
nose
hints
of
sweet
malt
a
bit
citrusy
and
a
small
lingering
of
tea
in
the
taste
i
got
a
carmelish
malt
sweetness
it
stays
on
the
palate
for
a
while
it
is
hardy
tasting
but
yet
a
lot
sessionish
lots
of
sticky
lacing
left
in
the
glass
i
could
session
this
and
not
get
bored
with
it
as
the
night
went
on
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
d
solid
cask
ale
not
overly
complex
but
certainly
pleasant
and
nice
english
flavor
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
not
great
in
all
respects
but
overall
quite
solid
it
would
certainly
work
well
as
a
session
beer
will
get
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
this
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
arguably
one
of
the
best
more
readily
available
session
beers
out
there
had
only
their
price
not
recently
gone
up

i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
in
switzerland
i
get
this
one
in
cans
only
and
as
such
it
is
my
medium
price
favorite
ale
finally
visiting
england
once
again
i
got
to
drink
this
one
out
of
a
bottle
must
say
the
difference
is
quite
astonishing
the
flavors
are
fuller
and
more
lucent
an
already
great
brew
now
truly
reveals
its
marvels
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
raises
a
1
5
finger
head
the
color
of
aged
paper
the
body
has
a
nice
ambercopper
color
and
theres
nice
lacing
to
boot
the
nose
has
a
mild
bread
caramel
maple
and
vanilla
aroma
theyre
very
comforting
this
is
a
beer
for
deep
draughts
it
has
a
wonderful
toasted
caramel
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
that
seems
to
be
it
but
its
done
so
well
the
mouth
is
exceptionally
smooth
with
both
light
body
and
carbonation
a
very
fine
ale
and
i
wish
i
could
sit
in
front
of
a
hand
pump
and
drink
this
all
day
drinkability
is
good
the
bitterness
is
moderate
but
lingers
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
not
too
bad
id
have
it
again
i
remember
drinking
this
one
ten
years
ago
and
i
swear
i
could
taste
snuff
tobacco
back
then
nothing
remotely
close
to
that
this
time
nice
beer
though
a
good
beer
to
finnish
a
night
out
delicate
and
light
but
with
taste
and
edge
weak
and
undefined
taste
from
front
to
finish
disappointing
like
experiencing
a
cold
glass
of
weak
watery
tea
i
wouldnt
even
cook
with
this
d
solid
the
sweetness
might
mean
i
wouldnt
drink
too
many
but
overall
a
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
for
me
better
than
a
lot
of
other
english
ales
compentent
but
not
distinguished
or
memorable
lovely
toffee
and
red
colour
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
that
lasts
some
lacing
to
the
glass
as
well
as
a
settled
ring
after
every
sip
slight
smell
of
malts
fruits
flowers
and
tea
smooth
flavour
with
plenty
of
rich
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
their
is
a
raw
hop
presence
at
the
finish
enough
to
balance
the
grains
mouthfeel
is

with

this

for

its
good

and
some
decent

complexity
maybe
there
should
be
a
little
less
diactel
but
its
still
very
tastey
d
fair
id
have
it
again
but
id
like
to
try
it
from
a
nitro
source
first
d
easy
just
not
much
to
this
this
beer
has
a
nice
apple
phenol
smell
appearance
was
above
average
taste
was
slightly
dry
and
almost
cidery
however
it
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
asked
the
question
do
i
want
another
no
i
really
would
rather
have
something
else
other
reviews
suggest
more
was
to
be

to

version
the
old
speck
is
a
better
choice
a
few
years
back
i
put
a
pint
or
two
of
this
away
in
a
pub
in
bury
st
edmunds
just
a
block
from
the
brewery
that
was
great
this
is
a
pretty
good
substitute
half
a
world
away
could
drink
this
stuff
all

long
full
bodied
full

mild
mannered
and
smooth

a
big

and
a
big

the
mouthfeel
is

good

with

its
worth
a
try
for
this
style
beer
served
on
tap
at
the
old
ship
in
fullerton
ca
pale
orange
color
and
fluffydense
white
3
finger
head
was
beautful
smell
was
faint
as
would
be
reflected
by
the
taste
of
the
hops
in
the
beer
now
understanding
this
is
an
english
pale
ale
i
think
the
lack
of
hops
was
pretty
reflective
dont
get
me
wrong
there
is
still
some
bitterness
and
english
hop
aroma
here
which
is
nice
there
was
some
sweetness
detecable
and
was
enjoyable
even
in
a
pale
ale
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
almost
watery
thin
not
carbonated
much
with
a
very
very
dry
finish
which
would
limit
the
drinkability
to
me
poured
very
nicely
into
a
pint
glass
dark
goldenreddishbrown
hue
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
about
a
half
inch
think
the
head
lasted
well
and
left
decent
lacing
the
smell
wasnt
particularly
strong
but
was
sweet
and
had
notes
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
the
taste
was
simlar
to
what
the
smell
suggests
sweet
with
caramel
flavour
with
a
slight
bitter
edge
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
if
just
a
little
watery
at
times
and
carbination
is
low
i
found
the
beer
very
drinkable
and
overall
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
would
definately
pick
it
up
again
this
was
okay
but
nothing
about
it
would
make
me
want
to
try
another
i
can
see
why
this
is
also
put
in
the
nitrocan
i
might
buy
it
if
i
see
it
in
that
form
just
to
compare
but
it
is
not
smooth
enough
nor
tasty
enough
for
me
to
get
it
otherwise
quite
similar
to
most
nitro
pub
ales
extremely
thick
and
rich
looking
with
dense
nitro
carbonation
and
a
beer
flavored
whipped
cream
on
top
aromas
are
very
light
of
caramelized
malts
tastes
similar
with
a
subtle
english
pale
ale
spiciness
and
bittering
the
nitro
dulls
the
flavors
quite
a
bit
but
really
amps
up
the
body
very
creamy
and
silky
smooth
texture
if
this
beer
were
a
little
bolder
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
it
would
be
killer
huge
white
head
after
an
aggresive
pour
into
a
sam
smith
tulip
body
is
clear
copper
much
carbonation
visible
light
grain
and
a
little
sweet
hoppiness
not
a
lot
going
on
taste
is
mild
and
slightly
bitter
metallic
and
a
little
sour
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
i
would
pass
on
this
again
kind
of
boring
even
vs
the
style
from
can
into
pint
glass
full
frothy
head
had
good
appearance
and
was
somewhat
spicy
at
first
tapred
off
to
somewhat
watery
at
mid
glass
but
had
a
good
fairly
long
finish
all
their
cans
come
with
a
peice
of
plastic
inside
apparently
to
help
retain
carbonation
caught
me
off
guard
an
interesting
beer
to
try
good
friendly
and
relaxing
british
pale
ale
pretty
drinkable
though
nitrocan
beers
generally
arent
among
my
favorites
a
very
creamy
mild
english
bitter
of
sorts
that
sure
is
fun
to
look
at
d
high
a
smooth
poundable
beer
i
like
this
can
very
much
pretty
darn
drinkable
this
one
needs
to
warm
a
little
above
fridge
temp
but
not
to
much
or
you
start
getting
stale
beer
tastesessence
not
nears
as
good
as
the
stu
ff
i
was
getting
in
the
early
90s
on
handpump
but
not
bad
very
nice
canned
ale
mouth
feel
is
watery
and
under
carbonated
mouth
is
heavy
nothing
there
to
help
clean
up
carbonation
is
almost
non
existent
and
i
drank
this
fast
considering
the
writeup
came
in
a
500
ml
bottle
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
really
a
nicely
balanced
english
ale
flavor
has
a
nice
taste
of
hoppiness
that
does
not
overwhelm
i
really
like
this
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
absolutely
worth
a
try
flavor
is
pleasant
but
very
mild
gentle
malts
grainy
bready
with
a
very
light
hop
bite
at
the
end
i
like
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
complex
and
interesting
as
some
others
ive
had
from
tap
in
the
uk
very
traditional
english
ale
similar
to
my
memories
of
the
ales
i
had
in
london
although
the
atmosphere
in
front
of
my
monitor
writing
this
isnt
quite
the
same
copper
colored
with
a
medium
creamy
head
aroma
has
equal
parts
of
malt
and
hops
fruity
character
and
flavor
medium
body
long
finish
sweetish
malty
with
typical
notes
of
nuts
and
caramel
and
only
a
discreet
bitterness
smooth
and
quite
enjoyable
opinion
well
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
british
ales
but
i
just
have
to
keep
trying
them
to
make
sure
this
is
about
a
session
beer
and
one
that
i
imagine
you
can
put
back
upwards
of
a
case
of
until
you
start
catching
a
buzz
i
think
that
ill
stick
to
bocks
for
now
bham
uk
it
pours
a
lovely
copper
colour
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
just
wont
go
away
the
smell
is
really
nice
i
was
expecting
a
sweet
malty
smell
but
its
suprisingly
well
balanced
and
hops
are
evident
those
bitter
english
sort
of
hops
the
taste
is
englishy
and
creamy
and
bitter
those
were
the
adjectives
i
first
thought
of
the
taste
is
a
bit
caramel
followed
by
roasted
barley
followed
by
bittering
hops
fuggles
is
my
guess
lacing
coats
the
side
of
the
glass
like
a
sheet
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slightly
heavy
and
drinkability
is
affected
a
little
by
the
heavyness
all
in
all
a
really
good
beer
that
i
think
ill
have
again
someday
drinkability
nice
its
a
very
good
example
of
an
english
bitter
reminds
me
of
some
nights
spent
sampling
good
bitters
in
london
notes
nothing
special
just
good
all
around
english
ale
i
always
enjoy
an
abbot
ale
no
matter
the
time
of
year
where
i
am
what
kind
of
mood
im
in
its
just
plain
good
and
friendly
its
a
very
consistent
performer
pours
like
most
nitro
beers
white
creamy

reading
other
reviews
ive
got
it
caramel
apple
the
taste
is
quite
alright
but
just
not
great
sweet
but
not
far
beyond
that
seeming
much
more
of
a
session
thirst
quencher
than
a
tasteful
brew
weak
on
the
hops
which
are
practically
unpercievable
at
the
end
and
again
with
em
brits
the
carbonation
is
almost
unexistent
to
the
point
of
making
it
dull
creamy
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
smooth
an
ok
beer
not
outstanding
not
too
bad
this
makes
a
fair
session
beer
a
little
more
hops
would
be
appreciated
also
since
they
got
rid
of
the
nitro
this
is
now
one
of
the
few
good
canned
beers
around
something
to
take
to
the

isnt

the

ale
helped
it
along
nicely
although
the
flavors
were
very
different
and
at
times
even
a
bit
funky
a
regarded
brewery
but
this
one
needs
costello
hop
bubbles
too
simplic
bitter
and
thin
mouthfeel
and
nothing
in
taste
maybe
this
works
fresh
and
caskconditioned

was
difficult
to

it

two
years

it
certainly
was

it

no

the

notes
ive
drank
these
before

its
been
a

i
thought
i
had

that

maybe
my

have

something
has
changed

oelergud

a
pleasant
easy
to
drink
brew
that
is
really
mellow
a
good
choice
for
most
foods
it
wasnt
great
before
and
now
theyve
started
bottled
in
clear
bottles
silly
chaps
drinkability
expected
a
bit
better
just
didnt
have
good
complexity
and
transitions
nothing
to
get
excited
about
golden
amber
when
served
it
came
with
a
thick
cream
of
a
head
which
after
reflection
might
have
been
the
best
part
mostly
all
malt
it
had
an
interesting
green
apple
aftertaste
not
awful
but
nothing
i
need
to
get
again
in
a
hurry
i
first
had
this
beer
in
england
right
near
where
it
is
brewed
it
is
much
better
fresh
from
the
tap
but
it
still
does
well
out
of
the
can
when
i
am
looking
for
an
english
nitro
ale
this
is
usually
first
on
my
list
very
good
poured
a
nutty
light
brown
with
a
very
very
thick
and
creamy
head
smell
was
quite
malty
the
taste
too
was
very
malty
and
had
a
very
creamy
consistency
very
similar
to
wexford
irish
cream
ale
if
you
have
ever
had
that
before
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
providing
you
like
this
style
will
likely
buy
again
recommended
if
you
like
english
beer
it
poured
a
hazy
brownish
color
with
a
large
head
it
is
nitro
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
one
of
malt
and
alcohol
but
little
else
the
taste
to
me
is
just
bland
it
tastes
somewhat
like
a
boddingtons
but
i
think
boddingtons
has
more
flavor
it
is
medium
bodied
and
can
be
drunk
for
a
long
time
but
i
didnt
want
to
good
drinkability
not
very
complex
but
extremely
well
balanced
certainly
a
different
approach
for
a
pale
ale
as
this
one
is
a
departure
from
most
british
and
british
style
american
pale
ales
ive
sampled
this
pale
ale
poured
a
hazy
amber
color
with
creamy
offwhite
nitrogen
foam
that
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
modest
lightly
malty
the
taste
was
a
bit
thin
but
was
malty
with
a
slight
tanginess
and
a
chalky
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
low
carbonation
there
was
a
mild
lingering
aftertaste
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
thin
on
flavor
and
body
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
creamy
head
the
head
is
sweet
and
creamy
then
the
hop
bitterness
of
the
beer
hits
definately
an
interesting
tastebud
experience
the
beer
is
fairly
light
and
easy
to
drink
goes
down
easy
like
other
nitro
cans
overall
its
an
interesting
and
good
beer
nice
hop
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
definately
well
balanced
and
smooth
very
drinakable
brew
outstanding
appearance
of
amber
with
a
constant
creamy
head
nose
is
malty
with
a
light
hint
of
fruit
taste
is
lightly
sweet
until
the
finish
with
a
light
hop
presence
again
light
frutinessvery
subtle
i
also
detected
a
very
light
hint
of
smoke
that
was
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
light
but
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
went
down
very
easily
excellent
drinkability
i
cant
decide
if
i
like
the
nitro
gimmick
or
not
i
do
like
the
creaminess
that
it
imparts
but
ive
also
heard
that
it
masks
the
flavor
to
some
extent
in
any
case
abbot
ale
is
good
beer
ive
had
better
english
ales
but
this
one
is
tasty
and
drinkable
ng
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
did
the
cascading
thing
forming
a
huge
thick
frothy
slightly
offwhite
head
which
had
amazing
staying
power
as
expected
for
a
nitro
can
ok
so
im
a
sucker
for
a
nitro
light
malt
and
hops
nose
drifts
off
the
coppery
brew
smooth
smooth
smooth
with
a
taste
of
caramel
malts
and
a
late
appearing
hoppy
bitterness
not
quite
as
good
as
when
i
had
it
on
tap
at
british
beer
co
last
spring
but
i
digress
smoothness
makes
for
great
mouthfeel
and
that
combined
with
the
taste
makes
for
great
drinkability
can
you
say
session
lovely
clear
copper
hue
under
an
offwhite
two
finger
head
that
lingers
briefly
and
leaves
a
few
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
crisp
with
fresh
malt
and
a
touch
of
flowery
hops
the
mouth
is
very
carbonated
quite
light
and
noncloying
theres
a
good
strong
malt
opening
followed
by
a
typical
british
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
just
a
bit
of
a
metallic
edge
in
the
taste
but
this
is
pleasant
within
the
overall
picture
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
clear
copperybronze
hue
it
is
rather
thin
in
color
i
fear
it
will
be
watery
nitrogen
induced
creamy
offwhite
head
yes
the
cascading
affect
is
pleasant
to
look
at
but
the
widget
is
such
an
annoying
gimmick
anyway
the
head
settled
at
two
fingers
in
height
very
sturdy
the
retention
was
fantastic
also
the
ensuing
lacing
was
webby
and
active
the
nose
was
lacking
in
potency
what
i
could
detect
was
indifferent
to
the
ol
snout
there
was
some
hints
of
fruitymalty
sweetness
i
cant
help
but
think
the
nitrogen
is
masking
some
of
the
aromas
wow
this
is
easy
drinking
obviously
this
was
intended
the
flavors
are
very
weak
some
vague
maltiness
hints
of
fruitiness
and
marshmallows
clean
and
meager
hop
bitterness
and
some
sweetness
is
noticeable
at
the
finish
as
is
a
mineral
twang
abbot
ale
easily
defeats
the
boddingtons
pub
ale
abomination
too
bad
i
cant
get
this
in
town
as
this
would
make
a
good
session
ale
mediumlight
in
body
a
little
watery
the
carbonation
is
small
and
slick
as
designed
id
say
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
good
and
tolerable
i
picked
up
a
nitrocan
on
a
whim
in
iowa
city
it
was
a
dollar
at
a
grocery
store
if
i
could
find
this
locally
at
a
reasonable
priced
id
buy
it
again
just
to
session
with
worth
trying
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
perfect
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
good
also
it
is
rich
in
pale
malts
but
has
some
carapils
to
boot
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
bitter
and
flavorful
but
something
about
this
beer
just
doesnt
work
it
is
medium
bodied
and
adequately
carbonated
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
creamy
finish
a
real
crowd
pleaser
over
in
england
im
sure
but
im
not
completely
sold
on
its
worth
over
in
the
usa
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
a
great
beer
half
decent
body
of
malt
with
some
buttery
textures
this
is
suspiciously
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
very
enjoyable
hey
whats
not
to
like
here
its
dry
wellcomposed
aftertaste
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
might
be
a
real
gem
on
tap
or
as
real
ale
though
the
beer
pours
an
unblurred
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
and
very
creamy
modest
sized
head
with
the
lace
a
quite
thick
and
sticky
sheet
upon
the
glass
fresh
malt
nose
that
is
sweet
a
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
rich
in
malt
sweet
and
the
top
chumpy
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
devoid
of
carbonation
as
one
would
expect
from
a
nitro
can
with
the
hops
inobtrusive
in
their
bite
and
presence
not
a
bad
beer
drinkable
and
a
good
first
beer
of
the
day
after
the
big
beer
night
of
yesterday
honey
colored
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
hung
around
for
the
duration
of
the
pint
it
literally
had
a
head
from
start
to
finish
and
left
fat
rings
around
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
and
doughey
flavor
is
sweet
yeasty
with
hints
of
apricot
also
a
bit
of
a
tangy
finish
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
smell
is
however
sweet
and
very
faint
the
taste
which
perhaps
being
a
step
or
two
above
wexford
cream
ale
is
still
nothing
too
spectacular
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
visually
more
than
anything
else
that
and
the
unique
creaminess
that
can
only
come
from
one
of
those
nitro
widgets
makes
this
one
go
down
nice
and
smooth
definately
one
to
try
what
i
really
like
about
this
one
is
its
session
potential
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
drink
great
volumes
of
this
beer
but
the
flavor
still
strikes
a
chord
with
each
can
it
is
infinately
better
out
of
the
bottle
as
the
can
has
metallic
overtones
you
find
in
all
canned
beers
but
thats
another
thing
that
really
impresses
me
between
all
styles
of
casing
for
a
beer
the
difference
in
quality
with
abbot
ale
while
still
noticable
has
been
kept
to
a
bare
minimum
you
gotta
love
that
nothing
worse
than
a
beer
that
fluctuates
wildy
depending
on
what
vessel
its
being
drunk
from
presented
in
a
green
can
with
an
abbot
on
the
front
poured
a
nitrogen

create
a
thick

as

marked
which

was

and
it

even
with
a

and

nitrotappoured
a
great
creamy
copper
with
a
very
sticky
headaroma
is
malty
and
more
malty
had
that
very
disctintive
englisg
hop
taste
with
a
malt
backbone
and
a
very
dry
finish
i
was
glad
to
try
this
on
tap
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
finally
decided
to
try
this
after
seeing
it
many
times
in
the
local
grocery
store
started
out
badly
with
an
unimpressive
smell
and
an
even
less
impressive
pour
virtually
no
head
maybe
i
should
have
tried
the
nitro
taste
isnt
bad
hard
to
define
almost
reminds
me
of
a
german
alt
or
bock
carbonation
a
little
high
body
a
little
thin
more
malt
than
hops
i
had
a
fullers
esb
in
between
two
of
these
and
it
blew
the
abbot
away
esb
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
with
this
beer
i
have
4
left
so
hopefully
ill
enjoy
it
more
next
time
deep
rich
amber
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
almond
head
my
mouth
is
watering
like
crazy
rating
is
for
the
second
one
because
i
drank
34
of
the
first
pint
in
one
pull
i
absolutely
love
beer
like
this
rich
full
aroma
with
a
distinctive
east
kent
goldings
scent
backed
with
lots
of
maltiness
carrying
a
pear

flavor
is
fantastic
medium
bodied
nitro
carbonation
lots
of

with
all
the

coming
through
in
the
finish
balancing
some
estery
fruit
flavors
fairly
dry
your
tongue
begs
for
more
im
happy
to
oblige
a
very
round
soft
malt
character
defines
this
beer
along
with
a
very
firm
earthy
spicy
goldings
fuggles
hop
character
and
bitterness
after
every
sip
i
found
myself
thinking
what
a
fine
session
beer
this
is
and
then
it
was
gone
confirming
the
fact
nerax
is
less
than
a
week
away
so
i
will
once
again
have
all
the
english
cask
ales
that
i
can
drink
this
beer
was
tolerable
at
first
but
as
i
drank
more
i
disliked
it
more
and
more
the
malt
flavor
is
pretty
unique
and
the
buttery
maltiness
of
this
was
a
bit
hard
to
take
after
a
little
bit
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
as
expected
from
the
nitro
can
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
taste
that
just
did
not
agree
with
me
a
very
intriguing
brew
in
the
great
english
ale
style
it
poured
so
smotth
with
a
legit
and
creamy
head
it
was
a
thing
to
behold
better
out
of
the
tap
than
the
bottle
the
flavor
from
this
ale
was
all
that
you
would
expect
it
was
slightly
sharp
but
very
little
in
the
way
of
hoppylike
snap
this
is
one
i
would
like
to
try
again
preferrably
out
of
the
tap
bottoms
up
ive
got
real
troubles
of
pinpointing
the
diffrent
tastes
it
gives
because
it
really
doesnt
taste
much
but
thats
maybe
not
bad
if
you
want
an
easy
drinkable
bitter
with
less
complex
taste
overall
its
decent
drinkable
yes
but
not
a
tastebomb
all
in
all
a
wonderful
english
bitter
the
best
i
have
tasted
so
far
in
the
nitrocan
very
drinkable
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
english
pales
and
bitters
this
one
was
really
nice
but
somewhat
typical
in
comparison
to
other
nitros
of
the
same
basic

with
some
warm

malt
huskiness
a
subtle
drycider
note
a
firm

and
just
enough
hops
to
balance
them
the
hops
are
very
smooth
and
linger
in
the
finish
nicely
complementing
the
slight
astringency
of
the
grain
husks
and
alcohol
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
makes
itself
noticeable
in
the
finish
thankfully
im
not
picking
up
on
much
metallic
taste
as
i
have
found
most
english
ales
to
be
unpleasant
in
this
regard
a
very
well
done
mild
ah
the

a
huge
cascading
tanoffwhite
head
beer
itself
has
a
deep
orange
nose
is
very
yeasty
breadlike
and
somewhat
metallic
due
to
the
can
soft
hops
herbs
and
some
fruityness
there
is
also
a
bit
of
maltiness
as
well
this
stuff
is
super
smooth
and
fun
to
drink
id
say
its
slightly
better
than
other
nitro
can
english
pub
ales
all
in
all
not
bad
but
id
really
love
to
try
it
on
tap
england
here
i
come
once
the
cascading
head
has
settled
the
body
is
clear
its
deep
copper
with
an
orangered
tint
and
the
ivory
colored
head
is
dense
and
creamy
the
aroma
is
intriguing
malty
bready
lightly
fruity
gently
caramel
almost
butterscotch
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
and
very
fine
bubbles
from
the
nitrogen
breakout
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
gently
fruity
upfront
revealing
caramel
and
some
buttery
notes
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
finishing
nutty
with
some
light
residual
bitterness
a
very
nice
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
a
great
session
beer
except
that
i
think
id
find
myself
seeking
more
bitterness
after
the
first
or
second
pint
a
hard
beer
to
score
because
the
nitrogen
pour
gives
it
such
a
nice
head
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
amber
highlights
pours
with
a
twofinger
dense
creamy
head
due
to
the
widget
the
aroma
is
light
and
fruity
very
light
on
the
palate
a
strong
malt
flavor
with
some
hops
bitterness
i
have
a
hard
time
defining
what
the
flavor
is
but
its
interesting
none
the
less
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
an
easy
drinker
a
good
beer
but
not

favorite

some

amazing

hope
to
have
on
cask
one
day
o
easy
drinking
and
well
rounded
o
as
far
as
the
english
pale
ale
style
goes
this
is
quite
outstanding
it
would
be
tough
to
find
a
beer
more
tasty
than
this
while
still
residing
within
the
traditional
style
guidelines
referring
to
this
beer
on
tap
in
uk
not
the
overcarbonated
bottles
you
will
occasionally
find
in
us
overall
pretty
solid
and
decent
enough
but
not
a
particularly
exciting
beer
overall
being
a
yorkshire
ale
i
feel
i
should
stand
up
for
landlord
but
really
theres
no
need
to
its
a
popular
draught
brew
in
several
pubs
hereabouts
and
is
a
deserved
reputation
as
a
good
solid
pint
one
of
my
favourites

im
drinking

i
would
gladly
buy
this

poured

floral
earthy

that

can
read
about

as
an
american
recently
moved
to
london
im
still
trying
to
find
some
goto
brews
im
finding
a
lot
of
the
bitters
and
pale
ales
just
dont
do
it
for
me
mostly
because
im
craving
some
fresh
hop
flavor
per
american
microbrew
standards
however
ive
had
some
enjoyable
if
forgettable
beers
in
the
process
timothy
taylors
landord
is
one
of
those
not
much
nose
some
hint
of
musty
english
hops
and
a
little
breadyfruityness
overall
flavor
pretty
good
with
balanced
malt
and
bitterness
i
get
a
little
of
that
toasted
bread
characteristic
others
mention
but
not
that
much
overall
a
pretty
flavorful
brew
with
good
balance
and
full
mouthfeel
however
like
many
pretty
good
beers
in
this
style
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
forgettable
kinda
like
a
sam
adams
that
is
to
say
id
be
happy
to
drink
some
more
but
can
see
myself
dreaming
about
it
at
night
500ml

i
usually
avoid
english
beers
because
i
worry
about
freshness
but
i
picked
this
up
after
gearing
its
a
good
one
light
caramel
color
decent
head
aroma
is
sort
of
bready
flavor
is
malty
and
pretty
darn
good
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
english
pale
not
bad
at
all
overall
admittedly
im
not
the
biggest
english
ale
fan
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
of
a
low
abv
pale
ale
though
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
especially
noteworthy
considering
the
strength
plenty
of
tasty
malt
with
a
decent
little
hop
dose
as
well
easy
to
throw
back
a
500ml
of
this
this
great
all
round
ale
i
was
well
surprised
with
my
chance
purchase
from
sainsbury
in
newry
pours
nice
looks
well
in
the
glass
great
head
retention
and
great
balance
throughout
im
just
sorry
now
i
didnt
get
a
few
more
it
will
definately
be
on
my
shopping
list
next
time
o
by
far
the
best
english
pale
that
ive
had
nice
balance
of
bready
caramel
malt
with
herbal
and
floral
hop
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
the
standard
500ml

a
pale

colour
with
a
pillowy
offwhite
head
which

restrained
aroma

and
sweet
caramel
malt
light
sweetness
at
the
start
gives
way
to
a
mineral
light
to
medium
bitter
finish
light
to
medium
body
nicely
balanced
and
very
easy
drinking
a
clear
copper
with
a
dense
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
gorgeous
lacing
this
looks
spectacular
the
nose
is
awesome
a
beautiful
bready
caramel
toffee
note
with
burnt
sugar
butterscotch
honey
minty
hops
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hops
this
is
fabulous
stuff
the
palate
opens
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
flavors
a
prominent
bitterness
fresh
earthy
mildly
minty
and
mildly
resiny
is
coupled
with
a
melange
of
malt
flavors
toffee
butterscotch
burnt
sugar
honey
and
a
little
cotton
candy
are
all
present
drying
and
bitter
on
the
finish
theres
a
lingering
earthy
bitterness
thats
spectacular
medium
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
higher
than
ideal
this
beer
feels
great
on
the
palate
a
truly
spectacular
beer
i
hope
i
get
to
try
it
fresh
and
on
cask
someday
comes
with
highest
recommendations
overall
drinkability
i
suspect
this
beer
would
be
far
better
on
cask
and
fresh
i
suspect
it
is
past
its
prime
by
the
time
i
got
to
it
still
a
full
flavor
english
pale
ale
which
i
suspect
would
be
amazing
on
cask
one
bottle
though
in
this
case
is
enough
for
me
went
well
enough
with
food
blt
salad
but
otherwise
i
view
the
overall
experience
as
just
ok
drinkability
was
such
that
i
finished
it
but
im
not
wanting
another
the
taste
is
malt
influenced
with
light
sweetness
and
breadiness
that
leads
to
light
herbal
flavor
from
hops
with
light
apple
and
pear
from
the
yeast
in
the
middle
with
hops
that
have
a
spiciness
which
accents
the
breadiness
from
the
yeast
and
malt
the
malt
flavor
also
has
a
mild
amount
of
caramel
which
blends
well
with
the
fruitiness
in
the
yeast
and
contributes
a
slight
sweet
taste
after
the
swallow
overall
i
loved
this
probably
the
best
in
this
style
of
english
pale
i
have
taste
i
like
the
complexity
for
such
a
small
beer
drinkability
and
worth
repeated
tastes
excellent
flavor
which
is
good
for
being
a
bottled
english
pale
the
taste
is
unique
to
britain
i
feel
like
saying
jolly
good
as
i
sip
this
one
down
good
sweet
malt
character
sweetness
and
a
mild
bitterness
to
end
enjoyable
it
always
is
a
joy
to
experience
a
tasty
yet
mild
ale
with
a
relatively
low
abv
content
landlord
fits
the
bill
to
a
t
the
malt
sugars
are
warm
and
smooth
throughout
providing
a
surprisingly
big
depth
in
rich
toasted
flavor
notes
the
hops
counterbalance
things
nicely
staying
in
the
background
for
the
most
part
yet
far
from
being
meek
and
inconsequential
overall
they
do
a
nice
bittering
job
without
going
overboard
if
this
were
more
readily
available
it
could
very
well
become
one
of
my
goto
session
brews
a
very
fine

my

lets
lynch
the
landlord
as
musical

and
away
i
went

the

a

of
the
malt

hops

allowing
the

to
have
its
moment

as
i
drank
i
feel
lucky
to
have
scored
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
yesterday
finish
was
semidry
with
the
malt
not
being
overly
sweet
and
the
hops
not
being
overly
aggressive
a
nice
way
to
begin
my
afternoon
a
strong
pale
ale
at
just
over
4
abv
not
sure
if
that
really
flies
but
its
more
of
a
classic
bitter
anyways
a
well
hopped
and
very
clean
beer
especially
for
the
style
radiant
bronze
color
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
an
inch
high
in
my
wine
glass
the
nose
here
is
bittering
hops
some
golding
varietal
i
would
guess
and
a
sturdy
pale
malt
base
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
nice
as
the
nose
though
very
little
real
hop
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
there
the
malt
really
flavors
the
beer
for
the
most
part
slightly
stale
cereals
as
we
are
accustomed
to
in
english
pales
and
bitters
and
its
all
well
put
together
and
fairly
priced
for
sure
but
there
is
a
finish
to
this
i
just
dont
care
for
intense
minerality
or
copper
flavor
taste
like
a
handful
of
coins
unflattering
and
with
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
yucky
especially
when
the
beer
warms
up
but
as
the
style
goes
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
that
makes
it
to
our
shores
medium
bodied
but
real
easy
drinking
still
reminds
me
of
a
grey
day
in
london
its
a
delicious
beer
that
sings
the
classic
praise
of
british
ale
anyone
who
bellies
up
to
a
british
bar
and
orders
such
pale
ale
as
this
will
be
greatly
rewarded
and
satisfied
great
fruitymalt
combination
that
goes
well
when
drinking
with
a
meal
one
of
the
best
english
ales
ive
tried
so
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
rjt
overall
after
seeing
the
massive
amount
of
love
for
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
bit
let
down
it
isnt
a
bad
english
pale
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
it
was
full
in
flavour
and
not
all
that
complex
worth
one
every
now
and
then
but
at
a
cost
of
90
a
case
aint
worth
it
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
traditional
style
brittish
beers
but
this
easily
takes
the
cake
truly
a
great
brittish
beer
that
i
would
drink
regularly
poured
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
light
fruit
flavor
is
mild
but
complex
with
light
citrus
and
light
pear
and
apple
juice
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
finishing
with
hints
of
tobacco
molasses
and
light
tea
inflected
grassy
hops
sharp
peppery
carbonation
amazing
variety
of
flavors
in
this
low
abv
pale
ale
nicely
done
a
heck
of
an
enjoyable
version
of
the
style
the
peppiness
of
the
decidedly
unamerican
hops
taking
this
thing
all
the
way
through
complex
flavours
abounding
and
with
the
rather
low
abv
this
is
obviously
the
definition
of
a
sessionworthy
brew
the
kind
you
hope
to
keep
seeing
reappear
on
the
wellkept
bar
in
front
of
you
sigh
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
wonderfully
balanced
between
noble
hops
and
fruit
esters
with
none
taking
the
center
stage
yet
each
coming
alive
in
there
own
manner
making
one
incredible
show
for
a
pale
ale
overall
this
surpassed
my
expectations
im
pretty
sure
this
bottle
had
been
on
the
shelf
at
least
a
month
or
so
and
with
that
it
still
tastes
delicious
a
good
changeup
from
the
american
style
pale
ales
im
used
to
going
back
to
pick
up
some
more
of
these
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
enough
carbonation
to
immediately
foam
this
up
on
the
palate
without
any
noticeable
fizziness
which
is
kind
of
amazing
closes
dryly
with
modest
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
enjoyable
beer
its
nice
to
have
a
traditional
style
beer
once
in
a
while
worth
a
try
the
medium
body
leans
light
and
it
actually
goes
smooth
rather
than
relying
on
being
heavily
carbonated
or
bitingly
crisp
crispness
is
there
of
course
but
it
does
lack
bite
a
touch
in
the
beginning
this
improves
a
lot
as
the
session
goes
on
just
a
little
bit
of
chalky
dryness
comes
into
the
finish
the
beer
pours
a
deep
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
stands
tall
and
lasts
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
excellent
mix
of
pale
and
biscuit
malts
along
with
a
touch
of
crystal
malt
its
light
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
plenty
of
english
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
well
balanced
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
has
a
light
sweetness
thats
enhanced
with
the
english
ale
yeast
it
emits
a
wonderful
fruity
character
the
hop
character
is
well
perceived
grassy
with
a
slight
floral
bouquet
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
real
tasty
beer
true
to
style
and
quite
delicious
d
great
english
pale
ale
great
balance
decorated
with
multiple
awards
landlord
is
a
better
representation
of
a
solid
british
ale
more
so
than
other
mass
produced
uk
exports
respect
for
the
old
school
style
and
quality
here
good
effort
and
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
appreciate
what
britain
has
to
offer
nice
medium
body
and
dry
flavor
its
dry
without
being
hoppy
i
e
traditional
flavors
up
front
are
dry
and
crackery
with
a
wellbalanced
hop
addition
at
midpalate
contributing
a
spicy
complement
finish
is
also
dry
good
firm
feel
and
not
overcarbonated
not
overly
complex
or
intensely
flavored
simply
an
appetizing
beer
that
would
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
sitdown
lunch
overall
this
is
a
great
english
pale
ale
but
actually
verges
closer
to
the
american
style
of
pale
ales
because
of
how
hop
forward
it
is
most
english
pale
ales
are
more
balanced
and
earthy
but
this
one
definitely
has
bitter
hops
shining
through
more
than
anything
the
slight
caramel
hints
from
the
malt
help
to
round
out
the
bitter
hop
punch
making
this
a
tasty
brew
that
falls
somewhere
between
the
english
and
american
pale
ale
style
this
beer
has
a
very
interesting
aroma
with
clear
notes
of
caramel
and
hops
the
taste
is
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
the
light
body
highly
drinkable
and
wellcarbonated
leaves
us
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
the
landlord
is
certainly
a
good
session
beer
though
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
and
some
mild
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
tealike
and
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
quite
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
excellent
head
retention
traditional
aroma
and
a
crisp
bitter
dry
taste
that
kept
warm
bready
malts
and
english
hops
in
balance
the
only
way
i
could
see
this
beer
improving
would
be
to
ease
up
on
the
superdry
finish
and
leave
some
residual
sugars
behind
overall
quite
an
amazing
beer
though
the
color
when
poured
was
of
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
orange
hue
with
a
fair
amount
of
white
foam
and
some
lace
the
smell
was
of
citrus
mild
hops
and
a
hint
of
leather
the
taste
had
a
leathery
pepper
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
sourness
not
what
i
expected
in
this
english
pale
ale
i
will
try
it
again
like
so
many
times
the
palete
dosent
alway
work
bitter
hops
reign
with
floral
and
earthy
notes
accompanying
a
bready
malt
character
just
like
they
should
in
an
epa
o
i
love
that
in
england
i
can
grab
one
of
these
from
my
local
cornershop
for
under
a
couple
of
quid
this
along
with
fullers
esb
is
an
exemplar
of
english
ale
not
that
newkie
brown
bollocks
recommended
with
a
ploughmans
lunch
in
a
pub
excellent
very
pleasant
and
smooth
beer
with
a
high
drinkability
shouldve
bought
at
least
two
o
really
nice
very
easy
to
drink
a
perfect
summer
beer
o
this
is
an
absolutely
stellar
beer
definitely
an
underheralded
british
pale
ale
i
would
yakuza
my
pinkie
for
the
recipe
o
it
doesnt
necessarily
have
a
pale
ale
hop
bite
its
dimmed
but
a
restrained
flavor
food
match
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
the
traditional
english
roast
pork
with
gravy
crackling
yorkshire
pudding
peas
and
roast
vegetables
as
a
side
note
my
immediate
impression
of
the
taste
was
that
it
bore
striking
resemblance
to
the
old
brewery
pale
ale
from
samuel
smith
having
noticed
that
both
breweries
are
located
in
yorkshire
im
wondering
if
the
similarities
can
be
attributed
to
having
similar
if
not
shared
sources
for
all
the
ingredients
including
yeast
a
nice
mild
brew
theres
something
quite
satisfying
in
the
mouth
feel
that
pushes
this
beer
into
topofitsstyle
territory
round
drinking
oatmeal
comes
to
mind
but
the
body
is
from
the
fine
carbonation
rather
than
han
any
real
viscosity
i
think
thanks
to
rose
at
stone
ys
well
carbonated
with
a
herbal
hop
start
sweet
middle
and
then
more
bitter
again
as
the
hops
reassert
themselves
theres
nothing
unsuaul
going
on
here
its
just
very
well
done
could
drink
plenty
of
this
o
a
very
enjoyable
easily
sessionable
beer
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
o
great
showing
of
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
clean
utterly
drinkable
and
sessionable
another
pint
please
probably
not
as
bitter
as
americans
would
expect
for
a
pale
ale
but
probably
defines
what
it
means
to
say
well
balanced
o
if
i
had
to
choose
one
beer
to
represent
the
entirety
of
british
brewing
this
very
well
might
be
the
one
id
pick
damn
tasty
and
so
quintessentially
british
flawlessly
executed
and
infinitely
drinkable
im
glad
timothy
taylor
and
co
finally
relented
and
decided
to
start
exporting
it
this
one
was
a
particularly
nice
cask
beer
and
a
great
start
to
the
morning
seeing
that
is
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
good
lingering
fruity
aftertaste
along
with
a
nice
feel
to
it
that
was
one
of
the
more
refreshing
cask
beers
o
this
is
an
excellent
english
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
really
bass
and
whitbread
have
nothing
on
this
beer
simply
a
fantastic
brew
and
a
near
perfect
example
of
what
traditional
english
brewing
is
all
about
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
cask
later
this
summer
overall
a
really
nice
english
pale
complex
and
flavorful
while
remaining
quaffable
it
has
just
the
right
carbonation
to
add
some
crispness
and
refreshment
but
still
stays
dry
this
is
an
elegant
pale
ale
tasty
pretty
standard
amber
in
color
short
lived
two
finger
head
with
minimal
lacing
smells
and
tastes
of
buttered
biscuits
with
a
lighter
amount
of
lightly
toasted
white
bread
nice
blend
of
yeasty
esters
with
a
slight
herbal
and
woody
tone
overall
light
body
yet
very
crisp
and
refreshing
medium
carbonation
a
solid
home
run
all
around
as
it
gets
really
close
to
textbook
for
the
style
if
only
there
was
a
better
head
a
winner
here
i
could
drink
this
every
day
a
great
example
of
what
english
pale
ale
should
taste
like
o
a
flavor
packed
english
bitter
for
a
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
refreshingly
bitter
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
fantastic
beer
that
im
glad
that
i
finally
got
to
have
o
this
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
extremely
enjoyable
and
infinitely
sessionable
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
very
flavorful
this
is
definitely
one
to
have
again
i
bet
this
is
an
amazing
real
ale
i
will
have
to
look
for
it
the
next
time
i
travel
over
to
the
uk
o
classic
great
beer
taste
is
similar
wonderful
crisp
firm
juiciness
and
spicyherbalflowery
herbwildflower
hop
bitterness
with
underlying
caramelly
maltiness
of
toasty
grain
that
lingers
and
some
apple
bread
it
is
beautifully
balanced
lively
engaging
and
outstanding
o
this
beer
is
perfectly
sessionable
but
quite
flavorful
and
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
try
this
on
cask
served
a
little
too
cold
to
start
with
better
as
it
warms
o
this
is
really
something
special
if
its
this
good
in
the
bottle
i
can
only
imagine
itd
be
exemplary
on
cask
back
in
england
a
gem
of
a
bitter
first
time
ive
seen
this
in
the
states
rich
flavor
and
body
plenty
of
the
caramel
malt
taste
but
theres
no
sweetness
better
hop
on
the
tongue
but
the
swallow
is
well
balanced
simply
put
a
very
good
traditional
english
ale
this
beer
feels
incredibly
large
yet
in
control
its
wonderfully
balanced
between
hop
malt
sweetness
bitterness
at
4
1
the
beer
even
seems
larger
than
you
would
expect
this
is
a
brew
i
feel
i
could
just
drink
all
night
and
not
care
for
anything
else
fantastic
stuff
overall
an
excellent
english
pale
ale
i
dont
think
id
seen
landlord
since
my
study
abroad
year
in
the
uk
so
i
was
pleased
to
see
it
in
the
bottle
here
in
the
states
sessionable
and
flavorful
a
nice
drinking
pale
ale
and
at
4
1
definitely
a
tasty
sessionable
one
o
a
solidly
made
if
a
bit
unspectacular
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
really
nice
id
keep
this
around
as
a
sessiongeneral
purpose
beer
if
it
were
readily
available
and
reasonably
priced
honestly
if
i
hadnt
known
this
was
a
pale
ale
i
would
have
guessed
that
it
was
some
german
lager
i
think
the
toasted
aspects
of
it
are
really
what
i
notice
most
that
being
said
not
quite
sure
how
pale
ale
this
comes
across
nice
enough
beer
refreshing
but
seems
to
be
lacking
in
some
departments
while
bringing
a
bit
too
much
in
others
gee
i
wish
i
could
get
this
locally
pint
served
in
typical
english
pint
glass
apple
juice
like
colour
medium
head
which
lasted
about
half
the
drink
clear
after
the
initial
haze
rose
to
the
top
smelled
of
cascade
golding
hops
also
strong
apple
notes
tasted
fruity
was
fairly
sweet
for
a
bitter
but
had
a
long
bitter
finish
mouthfull
is
smooth
without
much
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
bitter
which
has
taste
smell
character
and
sessionability
i
dont
get
to
excited
about
trying
a
4
english
ale
often
but
i
was
glad
to
get
my
hands
on
some
landlord
today
poured
into
imperial
nonic
a
clear
rich
brass
color
with
well
defined
one
finger
white
head
that
left
spotty
lacing
as
it
settled
sweet
biscuit
malt
mixed
with
fruity
estersa
noticable
iron
element
as
well
to
to
good
a
english
pale
a
great
creamy
feel
to
the
beeri
can
only
imagine
this
on
cask
whooosweetish
biscuit
flavors
with
fruity
tones
on
the
palate
with
a
decent
herbal
green
hopped
finish
this
beer
is
worthy
of
the
awards
it
has
onei
would
drink
this
all
nighti
may
never
try
this
other
than
out
of
the
bottle
wich
is
a
shame
ok
if
not
amazing
ive
had
this
on
cask
before
and
remember
it
being
better
the
diacetyl
hit
certainly
detracts
from
the
character
otherwise
its
well
balanced
and
drinkable
worth
sampling
on
cask
if
possible
has
a
light
amber
color
a
decent
white
head
with
a
complex
and
hoppy
aroma
you
can
taste
the
crisp
spring
water
and
it
has
a
fresh
and
clean
finish
although
it
is
definitely
so
much
better
as
a
cask
ale
in
their
uk
and
london
pubs
this
bottled
beer
is
very
reliable
and
a
must
try
o
a
classic
english
ale
of
the
highest
order
brought
across
the
pond
and
shared
by
a
friend
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
smells
of
sweet
bready
malt
slightly
earthy
hops
with
hints
of
butterscotch
and
a
touch
of
skunk
taste
is
sweet
bready
malt
with
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
with
earthy
english
hops
and
just
a
hint
of
butter
this
is
probably
the
first
beer
that
i
can
say
the
diacytl
actually
works
well
in
medium
to
light
body
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
i
wish
it
were
a
little
less
elusive
in
the
states
sampled
on
multiple
occasions
cask
conditioned
in
england
last
time
as
a
guest
beer
in
a
fullers
pub
unfortunately
served
at
room
temperature
apparently
they
kept
the
cask
just
under
the
counter
in
the
bar
not
in
the
cellar
if
the
cask
is
kept
in
perfect
condition
and
served
at
correct
cellar
temperature
the
beer
is
no
doubt
one
of
the
better
widely
available
cask
ales
in
england
the
liberal
amount
of
styrian
goldings
hops
makes
the
beer
stand
out
ive
even
contributed
to
a
landlord
clone
homebrew
which
was
quite
successful
overall
a
nice
session
beer
i
will
try
it
again
from
notes
i
wish
the
bottled
version
was
good
but
it
is
sadly
lacking
its
not
even
bottle
conditioned
medium
body
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malt
o
well
this
beer
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fair
example
of
the
phrase
familiarity
breeds
contempt
it
has
little
individual
character
and
was
maybe
a
little
boring
still
it
was
reasonably
refreshing
and
had
an
intriguing
aroma
the
drinkability
on
this
brew
was
low
thanks
to
the
aggressive
carbonation
but
for
my
money
the
drinkability
level
is
right
next
to
the
appearance
level
in
terms
of
actual
importance
anyway
this
was
a
good
enough
beer
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
a
pleasant
pale
that
comes
with
recommendations
conclusionnot
a
bad
pale
ale
just
not
quite
the
benchmarkgamechanger
i
was
expecting
b
geez
thats
a
good
beer
worth
the
3
60
i
paid
for
it
cheers
o
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
which
is
low
enough
in
alcohol

abv
to
work
perfectly
as
a
session
beer
or
even
on
its
own
this
is
probably
my
alltime
favourite
beer
even
though
epas
are
no
longer
my
favourite
beer
style
i
must
admit
that
maybe
some
local
bias
informs
my
opinion
here
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
clear
copper
pour
with
two
finger
head
and
decent
retention
and
great
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
subdued
at
first
biscuity
malt
caramel
tea
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
a
mild
fruitiness
all
of
which
open
up
nicely
as
it
warms
incredible
balance
and
fairly
complex
taste
great
earthy
herbal
fresh
hop
bitterness
offset
nicely
with
a
solid
biscuity
caramel
malt
backbone
really
smooth
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
almost
as
good
as
the
cask
version
i
had
last
time
in
london
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
english
beers
i
seek
it
out
every
time
im
visiting
d
a
terrific
english
style
pa
that
provides
full
flavour

great
session
beer
edit
i
have
to
say
on
cask
everything
is
better
its
such
a
great
beer
when
its
well
kept
dcould
drink
this
every
day
or
substitute
it
for
a
meal
d
really
tasty
and
very
drinkable
i
imagine
myself
at
a
pub
in
england
throwing
back
many
pints
of
this
brew
someday
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
cap
filled
with
a
bunch
of
large
bubbles
the
nose
brings
forward
a
slight
malt
presence
as
well
as
a
bit
of
toffee
and
light
diacetyl
though
not
at
all
to
an
unpleasant
degree
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
some
mild
fruit
and
caramel
in
addition
to
a
nice
bready
character
mild
buttertoffee
in
the
background
feel
is
pretty
good
nice
body
and
carbonation
all
in
all
at

this
is
a
nice
session
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
minimal
carbonation
in
the
mouth
the
palate
is
clean
and
finishes
with
nearly
no
bitterness
the
overall
strength
of
the
flavors
are
a
little
subtle
but
its
a
good
beer
there
is
some
mild
toffee
notes
with
a
little
buttery
but
not
diacetyl
flavors
overall
id
have
it
again
as
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
along
with
youngs
this
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
the
best
bitters
going
when
fresh
on
cask
to
know
a
beer
is
to
drink
5
a
day
for
5
days
landlord
makes
a
strong
case
for
a
sixth
day
d
after
drinking
not
much
else
but
apas
and
ipas
it
was
a
refreshing
change
and
the
catalyst
to
start
tasting
some
malt
driven
beers
could
see
a
few
of
these
going
down
quickly
in
a
session
nothing
too
much
in
your
face
just
really
well
balanced
something
im
keen
to
continue
to
experience
while
its
no
snpa
its
a
great
example
of
a
tradditional
english
pale
ale
recommended
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
yet
i
did
not
find
it
remarkable
in
any
facet
perhaps
its
hoppy
american
pale
alelike
qualities
help
it
earn
such
impressive
scores
a
decent
beer
not
the
best
i
have
had
on
cask
but
still
enjoyable
an
odd
nose
and
not
a
lot
going
on
though
still
worth
a
try
a
brilliant
beer
which
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
bottle
falls
down
in
a
couple
of
places
but
this
is
the
beer
to
try
if
you
want
an
authentic
english
bitter
notes
great
session
beer
pretty
crisp
and
well
balanced
d
top
notch
very
sessionable
and
easy
drinking
at
a
relatively
low
abv
could
easily
make
an
evening
out
of
this
quality
cask
conditioned
ale
sample
taste
i
had
was
somehow
better
than
the
12
pint
poured
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappeard
and
no
lace
very
clear
amber
color
aroma
was
malty
hoppy
and
a
touch
fruity
body
was
decent
ditto
carbonation
nice
finish
session
beer
low
carbonation
and
body
very
drinkable
overall
the
extra
hoppy
character
of
this
beer
may
not
be
quite
typical
but
it
certainly
makes
landlord
an
outstanding
beer
ive
always
liked
landlord
its
a
great
session
beer
from
keighley
but
with
a
few
more
beers
under
my
belt
ive
realised
that
im
starting
to
look
for
a
little
more
not
that
this
stopped
me
grabbing
another
pint
the
following
week
there
s
also
no
nasty
coating
or
dry
aftertaste
which
unfortunately
some
epas
do
leave
a
perfect
session
beer
complex
enjoyable
but
at
less
than
4
5
one
that
has
no
concern
on
overload
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
have
been
enjoying
for
years
it
was
one
of
the
first
good
english
pale
ales
that
i
ever
had
superb
taste
with
a
seductive
aroma
truly
a
great
british
beer
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
copper
colour
with
loads
of
carbonation
which
leaves
a
nice
two
finger
creamy
frothy
head
which
dissaptes
slowly
and
leaves
nice
bubbly
lacing
down
the
glassit
smells
of
fresh
hops
and
nice
malt
backnotesi
know
it
says
on
the
label
its
a
strong
pale
ale
but
its
clearly
not
and
doesnt
really
have
strong
pale
ale
flavours
either
but
this
beer
is
such
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
drink
alot
more
of
so
easliy
its
not
funnybut
in
saying
that
this
is
definately
my
most
favourite
english
pale
ale
going
around
and
has
been
since
i
first
tasted
it
years
ago
d
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
popular
session
ale
in
england
superb
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
make
this
a
great
brew
for
chugging
wish
i
could
try
it
on
cask
easyenough
drinkability
with
more
of
a
bitter
touch
than
typical
still
this
had
a
sort
of
green
apple
touch
wondering
if
this
was
a
slightly
infected
batch
it
was
coming
off
of
still
it
had
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
on
cask
in
london
not
quite
the
complex
beer
i
was
hoping
for
but
still
a
fine
session
ale
appear
a
hazy
amber
with
a
short
white
head
the
taste
is
a
more
typical
sweet
caramel
malts
with
sugar
candy
the
aroma
is
the
real
treat
here
with
a
mix
of
toast
toffee
and
lemon
rind
certainly
worth
a
try
cant
find
anything
bad
to
write
about
it
as
it
has
just
about
everything
it
should
great
look
smell
taste
and
nothing
it
shouldnt
so
go
get
one
sit
back
and
enjoy
would
definitely
drink
again
i
would
expect
a
strong
ale
to
knock
you
out
immediately
while
this
does
have
a
strong
sort
of
flavour
its
not
pleasant
enough
for
you
to
drink
enough
to
knock
you
out
a
disappointment
its
drinkable
enough
but
its
very
one
dimensional
like
a
standard
english
pale
with
the
hops
up
but
not
the
complexity
i
expect
in
say
an
esb
just
too
much
of
the
one
character
quite
a
shame
given
some
of
the
excellent
reviews
of
this
brew
on
here
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
pretty
much
every
night
it
is
my
goto
real
ale
in
london
overall
this
was
a
great
brew
and
i
was
excited
to
have
the
chance
to
taste
it
on
cask
while
in
the
uk
it
was
bone
dry
in
the
finish
which
was
a
big
surprise
for
the
style
wonderful
stuff
looks
fine
smells
nice
punchy
taste
for
a
pale
ale
crisp
now
i
want
another
one
d
with
the
abv
and
great
taste
this
ones
a
keeper
a
great
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
again
damn
good
epa
deep
orange
amber
lots
of
light
coming
through
big
head
holds
out
briefly
smells
really
diacetyly
and
sweet
a
hint
of
hops
thankfully
less
diacetyl
but
still
too
much
and
more
hops
in
the
taste
pretty
well
balanced
a
nice
amount
of
pinappley
sticky
hops
have
been
used
but
as
an
ipa
lover
i
could
always
use
more
sweet
bready
malt
comes
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
lasting
bitterness
lightmedium
bodied
high
carbonation
in
response
to
the
last
review
i
dont
think
it
was
a
bad
pint
ive
tried
this
beer
on
cask
twice
and
both
times
it
was
bland
and
boring
the
bottled
version
is
much
more
complex
and
tastier
serving
temperature
but
on
the
grand
spectrum
of
beer
only
average
at
4
1
of
course
its
drinkable
though
im
not
sure
where
they
came
up
with
the
idea
of
calling
it
strong
a
decent
english
pale
ale
a
little
surprised
that
its
rated
number
so
highly
on
this
site
but
does
it
really
have
that
much
competition
the
body
was
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
for
me
however
this
is
a
thoroughly
drinkable
beer
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
i
would
like
to
see
it
on
cask
to
give
a
real
comparsion
to
the
previous
pint
i
sampled
on
a
rare
excursion
to
the
north
i
had
opportunity
to
try
one
of
their
premier
brewers
being
an
ardent
southerner
i
have
to
say
i
was
shocked
at
the
outcome
as
our
barman
drew
the
pint
the
glass
was
full
of
thick
creamy
sudsy
head
this
settled
down
to
leave
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
creamy
head
with
fine
bubbles
the
aroma
jumps
out
at
you
floral
hop
malt
on
the
palate
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
no
effervescence
despite
the
liveliness
in
pouring
fullbodied
and
rich
a
good
balance
of
fruity
bitterness
this
would
be
my
choice
to
replace
alpha
king
enjoyable
and
im
hoping
this
helps
get
me
drinking
more
local
ales
final
statement
probably
the
nicest
beer
ive
ever
had
from
england
to
date
an
outstanding
english
pale
ale
highly
recommended
since
this
particular
bottle
came
a
long
way
to
get
here
im
trying
to
sip
slowly
and
savor
it
its
possibly
the
most
memorable
british
ale
ive
had
this
is
the
first
thing
ill
be
looking
for
on
cask
when
i
finally
make
it
to
the
uk
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
crisp
carbonation
and
with
the
low
abv
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
ok
pale
ale
nothing
special
really
mouthfeel
was
wonderfully
prickly
more
texture
than
i
had
anticipated
in
a
british
pale
ale
highly
recommended
edit
second
and
third
tastings
have
revealed
that
this
is
a
remarkably
balanced
beer
and
not
as
bitter
as
first
thought
although
clearly
more
bitter
than
the
average
epa
which
is
a
plus
brilliant
stuff
a
very
earthy
brew
fullbodied
with
loads
of
hops
however
little
malts
to
match
a
brew
which
accompanies
food
well
i
guess
however
not
the
lamb
kofte
i
had
taken
in
the
pub
in
greenwich
perhaps
an
efes
lager
would
have
been
more
suitable
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
pity
it
doesnt
travel
that
well
but
its
still
great
clear
golden
orange
topped
with
a
densely
bubbled
white
head
sticky
cobwebs
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
good
head
retention
very
soapy
hop
aroma
with
some
earthy
woodsy
fuggles
in
the
background
biscuity
caramel
malt
along
with
some
pear
fruitiness
the
flavor
opens
with
sweetly
toasty
pale
malt
a
lingering
biscuity
sweetness
pervades
throughout
makes
for
a
supremely
pleasant
aftertaste
the
malt
is
really
stellar
on
this
one
great
flavor
profile
with
the
perfect
choice
of
hops
to
finish
things
off
spicy
almost
peppery
a
little
soapy
and
very
saazy
with
a
bass
note
of
earthy
englishness
lighter
on
the
palate
and
easy
drinking
but
full
flavored
enough
to
be
in
the
upper
5
low
6
range
my
personal
standard
for
session
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
this
at
my
local
all
up
a
good
beer
i
will
aim
to
try
a
fresher
model
next
time
drinkinability
is
pretty
good
though
the
slightly
lively
carbonation
from
the
bottle
makes
it
more
manageable
as
a
session
ale
when
served
on
cask
a
very
pleasant
drink
a
bit
light
in
colour
for
me
i
like
a
bronze
darker
hue
to
my
beers
but
i
have
drank
this
beer
in
many
different
locations
and
enjoyed
it
every
time
we
meet
pours
golden
with
a
large
white
head
that
reduces
to
a
small
persisting
head
of
foam
that
lasts
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smell
of
citrus
hops
well
balanced
with
biscuity
malt
with
honey
and
ginger
notes
lovely
soft
hops
to
taste
with
a
fantastic
lingering
length
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
oily
a
little
thin
but
very
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
satisfying
to
enjoy
such
a
well
made
beer
a
typical
english
pale
ale
perhaps
slightly
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
but
a
good
example
of
a
sessionable
beer
perhaps
just
not
my
style
an
awesome
beer
now
i
know
why
everyone
raves
about
the
landlord
funny
thing
is
that
its
a
strong
pale
ale
at
4
3abv
perfect
stuff
overall
excellent
character
from
an
excellent
brewery
landlord
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
example
of
a
classic
english
pale
ale
excellent
session
ale
pours
a
bright
and
clear
copper
with
a
very
large
and
incredibly
thick
white
head
that
lasts
forever
and
leaves
gobs
of
thick
lacing
perhaps
the
thickest
head
ive
ever
come
across
on
an
english
pale
helped
by
lots
of
effervescent
carbonation
billowing
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
quite
hoppy
for
a
british
beer
clean
and
oily
saaz
hops
abound
floral
and
citrusy
with
a
tropical
fruity
note
and
a
hint
of
butter
as
well
the
hops
are
definitely
the
first
thing
you
notice
about
the
taste
too
but
its
perfectly
balanced
by
a
rich
and
complex
malt
profile
with
lots
of
fruitiness
and
a
slight
diacetyl
note
that
lends
it
a
rounded
smoothness
and
keeps
it
from
becoming
an
ipa
slick
and
crisp
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
body
and
fantastic
drinkability
make
this
the
ideal
session
ale
i
cant
decide
whether
i
prefer
this
to
fullers
london
pride
but
i
know
that
its
one
of
my
alltime
favourites
if
i
had
a
regular
source
for
this
at
a
reasonable
price
ive
no
doubt
it
would
become
a
frequently
revisited
friend
as
is
ill
make
do
with
what
i
can
get
and
be
grateful
for
it
overall
definitely
redrinkable
bitterness
shines
through
without
threatening
to
become
fatiguing
on
the
palate
perhaps
a
trifle
more
malt
would
have
improved
it
md
semieffervescent
on
the
mouthfeel
not
sharp
but
more
lively
than
being
just
smooth
mediumbodied
aromatic
and
flavoursome
this
is
a
very
quaffable
pale
ale
indeed
compared
with
my
note
of
the
bottledversion
six
months
ago
this
one
is
still
good
but
the
draught
version
when
on
form
is
simply
sublime
with
an
edge
that
a
filtered
perhaps
pasteurised
bottle
cant
possibly
compete
with
overall
a
first
class
pale
ale
one
of
my
favourites
highly
recommended
d
beyond
drinkable
this
is
about
as
perfect
a
session
brew
as
ive
had
great
stuff
a
classic
english
pale
ale
that
is
definitely
world
class
thanks
to
rapopoda
for
hauling
this
5000
miles
for
my
drinking
pleasure
clear
copper
orange
apricot
colour
with
two
fingers
of
bubbly
foam
good
lacing
and
the
head
settled
to
a
bubbly
white
cap
aroma
is
of
honey
apricots
and
floral
hops
largely
bitter
with
a
long
finish
honey
and
nectar
flavours
most
obvious
very
hoppy
as
expected
and
some
fruit
flavours
too
apricot
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
i
had
two
pints
of
timothy
taylors
landlord
that
day
in
leeds
the
first
one
at
the
venerated
real
ale
temple
of
the
duck
drake
which
was
just
the
right
setting
for
my
initiation
handpulled
from
a
cask
it
poured
with
an
orange
gold
color
and
with
creamy
foam
smelling
of
sweet
citruses
and
flowers
it
had
a
full
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
pears
it
was
discreetly
carbonated
and
had
a
great
mouthfeel
landlord
definately
belongs
in
the
ipa
hall
of
fame
later
that
day
i
had
another
pint
at
leeds
stations
white
rose
it
was
served
slightly
colder
and
with
a
little
more
carbonation
which
suits
my
palate
better
i
dont
know
where
the
strog
comes
in
but
i
would
be
pretty
damn
happy
if
the
local
pub
could
pull
a
pint
of
this
this
beer
has
really
grown
on
me
i
liked
it
then
i
really
liked
it
by
the
end
i
loved
it
my
word
this
is
one
tasty
beer
it
is
the
complete
package
imo
it
is
very
flavorful
easy
to
drink
and
low
in
alcohol
this
is
a
session
beer
it
is
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
in
fact
check
the
dictionary
and
youll
see
a
picture
of
landlord
this
is
a
great
beer
simple
as
that
my
sample
arrived
fresh
from
england
via
howard
and
lynne
thank
you
so
much
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
beer
highly
recommended
from
bottle
getting
pretty
close
to
use
by
date
3
months
pours
clear
orangeamber
with
a
good
bubbly
head
that
retains
pretty
well
sweet
malt
and
flowery
hops
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
little
grass
in
the
background
flavour
is
sweet
at
first
then
the
bitterness
hits
and
stays
around
for
a
while
in
the
aftertaste
probably
mild
for
hopheads
but
quite
bitter
for
me
carbonation
is
good
and
overall
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
i
think
i
need
a
bit
more
practice
with
this
style
note
had
this
in
bottle
form
a
few
times
which
isnt
even
in
the
same
galaxy
as
having
the
brew
fresh
and
in
the
cask
in
bottle
it
was
very
hoppy
and
bitter
it
is
amazingly
smooth
and
complex
on
cask
if
this
was
available
locally
id
have
trouble
drinking
anything
else
oncask
at
the
bow
bar
in
edinburgh
this
was
reet
onform
darren
i
can
assure
you
but
i
would
still
like
to
try
it
in
its
natural
habitat
keighley
west
yorkshire
to
see
if
it
really
is
jus
dat
much
better
dere
a
dark
goldenorangeglowing
pumpkin
looking
brew
with
a
modest
head
for
a
cask
ale
that
leaves
patchy
lacing
all
over
my
imperial
pint
glass
aromas
are
very
tealike
and
ohso
british
with
the
saaz
aroma
hitting
my
nostrils
hard
up
front
leading
into
a
lovely
warmbread
maltiness
and
a
slightly
dry
floral
fruity
hop
finish
very
nice
taste
is
zesty
and
hoppy
up
front
with
some
nice
citrus
flavors
that
melt
into
a
bready
malt
flavor
that
leads
into
a
hoppy
dry
zesty
and
slightly
bitter
finish
yum
mouthfeel
is
creamy
medium
bodied
and
just
ohsoright
drinkability
is
ridiculous
i
can
have
quite
a
few
of
these
if
push
comes
to
shove
yes
yes
it
is
as
good
as
they
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
english
pale
ales
that
i
have
ever
imbibided
and
certainly
worthy
of
its
hype
one
of
the
best
cask
ales
going
like
for
sure
dude
shamown
darren
when
are
you
taking
me
to
west
yorkshire
im
free
this
weekend
other
comments
really
crisp
and
fresh
tasting
sort
of
explodes
with
classic
english
hop
flavor
its
no
wonder
this
has
been
and
arguable
still
is
one
of
the
hallmark
english
pale
ales
this
is
definitely
the
best
pale
ale
ive
ever
tried
so
quaffable
it
hurts
drinkability
is
very
quaffable
very
good
beer
quite
simply
tim
taylors
have
brewed
one
of
the
great
pale
ales
anywhere
yet
another
english
classic
that
clearly
shows
a
brewer
does
not
have
to
go
over
the
top
to
create
a
big
powerful
beer
a
great
beer
would
definatly
try
it
again
bottled
its
a
different
kettle
of
fish
more
carbonation
which
cuts
on
the
drinkability
its
rocky
head
and
golden
light
brown
color
are
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
it
has
a
floral
citrus
aroma
with
a
sweetness
that
makes
you
glad
you
chose
it
allegedly
designed
to
clear
the
throats
of
yorkshire
coalminers
it
starts
with
a
big
malty
taste
caramel
and
finishes
bitter
and
dry
tying
in
the
floral
spiciness
that
was
initially
smelled
this
is
a
very
quaffable
beer
and
one
that
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
copper
with
a
persistent
and
pillowy
white
head
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
full
of
malt
with
caramel
and
bread
notes
and
some
floral
and
earthy
hops
flavor
begins
somewhat
sweet
with
some
caramel
and
citrus
notes
then
becomes
quite
bitter
with
an
herbal
finish
quite
hoppy
compared
to
other
british
pale
ales
ive
had
quite
a
bit
of
character
to
this
one
i
still
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
cask
as
the
bottled
version
is
perhaps
a
bit
overcarbonated
a
pale
dark
golden
in
colour
this
ale
has
been
awarded
time
and
time
again
with
good
reason
forget
a
bottled
version
get
this
one
on
tap
in
a
full
measure
pint
glass
remember
mines
a
full
pint
this
sort
of
beer
is
the
thing
i
miss
most
about
england
floral
aromas
with
the
malt
and
hops
coming
through
but
not
overpowering
full
flavoured
and
so
easy
to
drink
served
at
room
temperature
say
12csomething
or
other
f
who
knows
in
a
good
pub
without
chrome
fittings
and
too
loud
musicand
but
i
digress
if
you
are
in
england
try
this
beer
i
like
to
pour
it
into
the
glass
to
lose
some
of
the
fizz
it
then
tastes
more
like
cask
beer
also
do
not
drink
this
beer
too
chilled
i
think
about
11
c
is
correct
superb
session
ale
indeed
make
sure
you
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
if
you
store
it
in
your
fridge
the
zesty
hop
bitterness
in
particular
really
starts
to
develop
as
it
warms
extremely
tasty
brew
satisfying
bitterness
excellent
great
beer
easy
to
drink
and
still
has
a
real
taste
perfect
beer
for
campfires
kilt
lifter
is
still
better
a
pretty
awesome
beer
well
done
four
peaks
balance
and
clean
flavor
are
the
hallmarks
of
this
brew
wonderful
hop
character
good
body
smooth
flavorful
and
satisfying
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
go
to
either
of
their
pubs
or
see
it
in
a
store
pours
a
clear
caramel
with
a
slight
off
white
head
aroma
is
bready
with
a
touch
on
the
doughy
side
of
things
a
little
herbal
a
touch
floral
and
slight
fruity
essence
flavor
pretty
much
followed
suit
but
with
a
bit
of
it
thinning
out
in
the
finish
a
crisp
active
thinner
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
session
ale
a
lot
nothing
crazy
or
standoutish
just
a
solid
sessionable
epa
that
i
could
drink
over
and
over
if
it
made
it
out
colorado
i
am
sure
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
come
summertime
nothing
special
about
this
beer
pretty
average
all
around
i
bought
a
full
sixpack
of
this
and
thankfully
i
wont
have
any
trouble
getting
rid
of
this
before
i
have
to
head
back
east
on
thursday
morning
session
beers
dont
get
any
more
obvious
than
this
and
as
hard
as
this
was
to
like
it
was
as
hard
to
dislike
fits
the
style
well
and
i
almost
thought
this
was
a
vienna
lager
because
of
the
maltiness
that
was
present
thorughout
from
start
to
finish
not
a
bad
start
for
anyone
like
me
who
hasnt
had
a
beer
from
the
grand
canyon
state
in
ages
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
ale
nice
toast
and
malt
notes
would
to
stop
by
the
brewery
again
for
it
on
tap
o
this
is
the
third
time
i
tried
this
beer
note
to
self
not
again
more
to
dislike
than
to
like
overall
not
bursting
with
flavor
by
any
means
but
true
to
the
epa
style
that
definitely
leans
toward
the
maltier
side
when
compared
to
apas
the
beer
was
ok
crisp
and
refreshing
but
nothing
all
that
great
in
the
process
of
tasting
9
new
beers
and
so
far
this
one
rates
an
8
out
of
10
i
was
really
surprised
at
the
great
tase
since
i
normally
prefer
a
hoppy
beer
or
a
very
dark
stout
i
woul
definately
buy
this
by
the
case
if
it
were
available
here
in
pennsylvania
it
is
so
smooth
with
an
almost
light
body
i
could
almost
classify
this
as
a
pilsner
but
with
more
flavor
poured
a
deep
gold
soapy
head
fine
lacing
smells
zesty
and
citrusy
fresh
taste
is
well
balanced
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
bite
on
the
tail
end
mouthfeel
is
excellent
creamier
than
expected
and
prods
you
to
pop
another
open
an
overall
well
example
of
the
style
and
just
very
enjoyable
to
drink
got
a
bottle
at
ajs
this
reminds
me
of
tree
fort
ale
from
michigan
which
is
also
a
very
bright
take
on
the
english
pale
ale
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
a
mix
of
lemony
hops
and
toasty
bready
malts
its
not
necessarily
clean
like
theres
a
gentle
creamy
undertone
with
the
yeast
playing
a
small
complement
to
the
malts
a
tasty
session
beer
worth
trying
my
bottle

by
englishstyle
standards

flavors
are

very

ibus
text
on
the
bottle
suggests
you
shouldnt
drink
this
beer
alone
guess
i
blew
it
tasty
nonetheless
overall
a
good
allpurpose
beer
on
the
lighter
side
and
not
too
much
to
it
tastes
great
i
have
it
at
four
peaks
brewery
all
the
time
and
matches
well
with
a
lot
of
the
things
on
their
menu
not
really
hoppy
either
this
beer
has
a
great
smell
to
it
and
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
pretty
light
pouring
beer
and
really
there
wasnt
a
lot
too
it
it
was
overly
sweet
but
lacked
a
lot
of
body
to
the
beer
which
is
a
little
surprising
very
little
detectable
hops
and
just
a
bland
beer
overall
a
little
too
light
and
a
little
too
sweet
a
light
quaff
with
a
spicy
touch
of
hops
more
drinkable
than
some
but
not
very
interesting
o
a
good
session
brew
that
has
enough
flavor

makes
this
a
beer
to
buy
by
the
case
the
cask
gave
a
super
creamy
body
that
was
just
about
the
best
part
of
this
beer
easy
drinking
and
quite
enjoyable
i
must
say
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
tempe
this
was
my
introduction
to
4
peaks
i
thought
it
was
an
excellent
example
of
english
pale
ale
the
aroma
is
a
beautiful
blend
of
pale
malt
and
english
hops
my
nose
said
goldings
acting
as
an
invitation
to
drink
the
beauty
of
the
aroma
carries
through
to
the
flavor
and
mouth
feel
the
balance
of
malt
hop
flavor
sweet
and
bitter
is
excellent
to
my
taste
it
would
be
hard
to
improve
on
this
one
overall
impression
this
isnt
too
exciting
but
its
drinkable
solid
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
very
nice
drinking
well
balanced
and
light
on
the
abv
d
theres
a
nice
blend
of
familiar
and
complex
here
the
sort
of
beer
you
could
do
a
session
with
especially
since
its
only
4
5
abv
d
good
for
seshing
on
personally
i
think
its
a
little
bland
compared
to
four
peaks
other
concoctions
still
a
good
brew
though
i
found
this
englishstyle
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
enthusiastically
pick
up
a
sixpack
in
the
future
it
is
an
excellent
arizona
beer
made
light
and
ready
for
the
hotter
temperatures
from
april
to
october
it
is
recommended
to
be
accompanied
by
indian
or
middleeastern
food
but
as
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
either
i
say
this
would
be
spot
on
with
a
nice
basket
of
fish
and
chips
if
youre
going
to
go
with
an
englishstyle
beer
you
might
as
well
go
with
englishstyle
food

a

im
still
trying
to
determine
whether
im
a
fan
of
but
i
do
appreciate
adherence
to
style
and
four

delivers
in
that

they
even
adjust
the
softness
of
the

used
in

cant
say
ill
never
try
8th

again
but
hop
knot
remains
my
goto
four
peaks
brew
this
beer
had
one
of
the
best
clarity
cask
offerings
i
have
ever
drank
showcases
the
hop
flavor
exceptionally
d
one
of
the
things
ive
definitely
learned
from
being
a
member
of
this
site
is
that
when
in
insert
city
name
here
drink
as
the
locals
do
this
completely
applied
this
time
at
phoenix
for
a
conference
taste
kind
of
sweet
fruity
lemon
and
orange
notes
a
little
heavy
on
those
actually
carbonation
is
great
for
an
english
i
taste
candy
as
well
very
drinkable
for
warmer
weather
enjoyed
on
tap
in
scottsdale
brewed
in
tempe
a
keeper
english
style
hops
and
understated
approach
a
faint
hop
aroma
light
yellow
and
very
lacey
average
mouthfeel
a
nice
bitterness
carbonation
right
there
good
balance
between
bitterness
and
the
malting
glad
i
tried
it
i
wouldnt
chase
it
pours
a
light
yelloworange
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
very
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
sticking
on
the
rim
of
the
glass
a
good
bitter
hop
character
in
the
nose
brighter
than
expected
with
a
tangy
yeast
ester
and
a
slight
note
of
sweet
malt
light
in
body
good
flavor
and
easy
enough
to
drink
all
day
overall
a
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
epa
but
might
not
be
hoppy
enough
to
please
americanized
hop
seekers
who
immediately
think
hops
when
they
see
the
words
pale
and
ale
near
each
other
a
fine
beer
in
my
opinion
could
be
paired
nicely
with
fruit
salad
and
wheat
muffins
on
a
spring
morning
in
the
sun
d
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
having
often
the
flavor
is
balanced
yet
complex
and
would
be
appropriate
for
a
variety
of
occasions
and
food
parings
furthermore
i
enjoyed
this
english
pale
ale
much
more
than
the
boddingtons
pub
ale
i
have
tried
this
is
currently
my
favorite
beer
golden
straw
color
with
some
orange
highlights
white
head
jumps
up
but
doesnt
last
nose
is
sweet
with
hints
of
candied
orange
on
the
tongue
8th
street
packs
a
little
more
hopping
in
the
bottle
theres
a
pleasing
bite
of
citrus
with
a
hint
of
resin
the
english
style
malt
is
right
there
too
it
loses
a
little
in
the
carbonation
department
as
i
found
myself
wishing
the
heft
of
the
malt
would
come
through
more
but
alas
it
is
washed
away
too
quickly
d
beautiful
session
beer
exceedingly
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
that
i
could
session
with
its
good
taste
and
fairly
low
abv
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
pale
orange
in
color
with
a
head
of
creamy
texture
the
nose
is
citrusy
initially
it
gets
sweeter
with
orange
notes
and
wild
flowers
some
toasted
malt
is
mixed
in
light
and
clean
at
first
a
refreshing
note
of
green
tea
hits
the
palate
orange
peel
is
subtle
but
that
tea
flavor
is
very
dominate
on
the
stage
not
much
malt
is
tasted
in
this
one
a
little
unbalanced
for
my
liking
but
still
a
pretty
decent
brew
overall
this
wasnt
a
great
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
succeeds
in
putting
money
in
the
bank
for
four
peaks
worth
a
shot
comments
very
drinkable
beer
the
beer
claims
to
be
a
english
pale
ale
but
i
would
call
in
more
of
an
american
pale
ale
with
its
exuberant
floral
hop
flavor
pours
a
filtered
amber
yellow
color
body
average
white
head
carbonated
fruity
taste
clean
aftertaste
citrusy
lemony
maybe
grapefruit
creamy
tasting
citrusy
aroma
hoppy
some
nuttiness
l
n
the
taste
as
it
warms
up
palate
is
skewed
into
the
lemon
citrus
direction
also
especially
with
the
cask
version
of
the
ale
the
seemingly
lighter
body
makes
this
almost
as
light
and
refreshing
as
a
cold
lemonade
but
the
slight
toasty
flavors
of
the
malt
and
overall
rounded
hoppiness
remind
you
of
whats
in
the
glass
i
dont
got
much
to
say
since
theres
not
much
going
on
here
great
session
beer
very
good
drinkability
and
with
the
lower
alcohol
this
makes
a
good
session
beer
d
could
drink
all
day
long
dthis
was
a
great
beer
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
incredible
flavor
overall
nice
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
an
enjoyable
smooth
pale
ale
thanks
dana
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
english
pale
ale
that
has
its
hops
take
a
rather
different
direction
then
the
norm
and
thats
fine
by
me
it
certainly
held
my
interest
for
the
session
four
peaks
8th
street
ale
is
a
decent
english
apa
that
is
probably
one
of
the
brewpubs
biggest
sellers
its
approachable
its
reasonably
tasty
and
its
sessionable
keep
your
expectations
in
check
and
youll
be
pleased
thanks
tayner
mk
a
medium
yellow
with
a
lot
of
foam
this
beer
didnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
to
it
some
malt
was
about
it
tastes
of
malt
and
maybe
some
nuts
the
flavor
is
mostly
bitter
and
twodimensional
its
pretty
drinkable
in
an
unobtrusive
way
but
it
could
use
some
more
flavor
to
it
i
like
this
beer
the
first
few
times
i
drank
it
but
as
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
some
more
complex
beers
this
one
seems
a
little
less
impressive
every
time
i
drink
it
a
shame
because
its
local
and
i
wish
four
peaks
the
best
they
should
bottle
some
of
their
bigger
and
better
beers
so
that
the
rest
of
the
world
can
try
them
anytime
this
is
availabe
cask
get
it
d
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
unique
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
this
pale
ale
is
one
of
the
top
core
beers
from
4peaks
d
i
dont
think
ill
have
another
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
socialize
over
its
not
too
strong
so
you
can
have
a
few
without
the
worry
of
getting
silly
i
also
like
it
because
its
local
drinkability
is
good
not
a
really
fancy
or
big
flavored
beer
but
i
like
it
it
is
tasty
and
easy
drinking
very
sessionable
ill
take
another
from
nvsblman
for
my
anny
bombing
drinkability
ill
stay
away
from
this
one
in
the
future
d
a
drinkable
but
inoffensive
beer
a
few
would
cause
minimal
problems
drinks
pretty
good
just
nothing
too
complicated
here
id
say
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
apa
than
an
english
pa
decent
session
ale
d
a
very
nice
session
beer
goes
down
easily
and
goes
pretty
well
with
all
most
any
food
ive
tried
it
with
gotta
say
my
favorite
local
beer
d
very
sessionable
due
to
its
easy
to
handle
flavors
and
it
wont
make
you
fill
full
very
fast
not
my
kind
of
session
beer
but
very
well
done
none
the
less
not
a
bad
little
beer
from
the
az
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
english
pale
ale
style
but
i
am
guessing
that
its
not
as
hoppy
as
the
american
pale
ales
at
least
thats
what
i
got
from
this
one
sure
it
had
its
hop
presense
but
it
wasnt
over
the
top
i
thought
it
blended
well
with
the
caramel
malts
on
top
of
that
it
kind
of
had
a
slight
orangey
finish
i
would
reccomend
this
one
props
for
such
a
well
made
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
little
alcohol
session
beer
i
would
love
for
this
beer
to
be
available
in
nebraska
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
3fs
pride
joy
mild
ale
lingering
aftertaste
that
begs
to
be
paired
with
burgers
grilled
cheese
or
anything
bbq
lovely
thank
you
aunt
kathy
and
uncle
rick
for
sending
me
this
fine
az
brew
recommended
was
in
tempe
recently
for
business
and
stopped
by
a
local
frys
grocery
store
to
haul
a
couple
of
sixers
home
wasnt
sure
what
i
was
looking
for
but
saw
they
had
the
local
microbrewery
there
and
brought
a
6pack
of
their
epa
home
dark
gold
light
copperish
and
very
clear
head
doesnt
last
but
leaves
a
light
tan
ring
around
my
glass
aroma
of
malt
and
english
hops
beer
is
well
balanced
and
a
good
example
of
the
epa
style
finishes
malty
but
with
enough
hop
bitterness
this
is
one
i
will
hunt
down
and
bring
home
every
time
im
in
the
phoenix
area
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
surprise
i
grabbed
it
on
a
lark
and
the
ample
hop
presence
is
quite
nice
i
get
notes
of
orange
peel
grapefruit
and
toasted
biscuits
quite
nice
and
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
this
is
a
golden
orange
brew
that
poured
a
decent
head
with
ample
carbonation
and
is
leaving
a
splotchy
lacing
nose
is
of
floral
malts
very
interesting
taste
is
a
bit
malty
to
start
with
a
carmel
floral
ever
so
slight
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
full
for
this
style
drinkability
is
good
this
has
the
makings
of
a
nice
session
beer
produced
a
light
head
not
too
surprising
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
goldenamber
the
aroma
is
a
little
light
but
clean
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
malt
the
flavor
is
nice
also
crisp
but
with
a
pronounced
hoppy
flavor
and
a
nicely
balanced
malt
bitterness
combination
some
hints
of
cinnamon
and
maybe
a
little
caramel
are
apparent
very
tasty
very
nice
for
its
style
id
take
it
over
a
bass
any
day
just
also
not
very
adventurous
granted
this
isnt
an
extreme
beer
style
but
it
could
use
a
little
pep
or
more
alelike
character
thanks
to
my
secret
santa
nvblsman
for
this
one
overall
solid
bitter
but
itll
leave
you
wanting
something
dry
to
finish
up
with
was
at
the
brewery
this
afternoon
sampled
two
pints
of
this
one
server
came
back
both
times
with
a
brew
lacking
any
kind
of
a
head
just
a
ghost
of
one
ringing
the
circumference
of
the
glass
beer
itself
was
a
shade
lighter
than
your
standard
amber
redgold
might
be
the
best
way
to
describe
it
good
shot
of
hops
up
the
nose
in
the
aroma
some
grainfloral
notes
beer
had
the
same
teatang
i
experienced
with
the
brewerys
peach
beer
are
they
adding
liptons
to
every
batch
not
much
bite
in
the
taste
the
hops
seeming
to
expend
their
force
in
the
nose
maybe
ive
been
conditioned
by
sierra
nevada
but
i
usually
expect
the
hops
in
a
pale
ale
to
grab
me
by
the
throat
finished
with
an
aftertaste
of
tea
drinkable
but
why
settle
comments
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
have
had
both
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
in
the
bottle
a
great
first
starter
beer
to
the
land
of
craft
brews
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
are
great
they
have
always
seemed
to
have
been
able
to
keep
the
quality
very
consistant
great
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
a
great
tasting
session
craft
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
half
inch
of
whitish
head
which
shrunk
down
to
a
small
layer
of
foam
reasonably
quickly
slight
lacing
but
what
does
form
stays
put
light
amber
in
hue
with
a
light
malty
aroma
flavor
is
of
light
malt
which
is
partnered
rather
well
a
complementary
amount
of
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
kind
of
detracts
from
the
whole
experience
nothing
terrible
about
this
brew
but
no
cause
to
trumpet
its
existance
either
light
copper
body
with
some
carbonation
topped
by
a
foamy
twoplusfingers
of
tight

bubbles

is
heavy
and
a
hint
harsh
with
hay
with
some
more
floral
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
lighty
malty
with
some
lighty
floral
and
earthy
hop
accents
aftertaste
has
a
very
slight
soapy
note
mouthfeel
is
slighty
watery
slight
defects
aside
it
could
make
for
a
suitable
session
beer
for
an
evening
but
not
one
i
would
frequent

a
huge
thanks

overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this

still
its
hard
to
fault
a
beer
for
being
too
drinkable
even
if
it
isnt
extraordinarily
interesting
or
experimental
really
though
thats
the
case
with
many
members
of
revolutions
standard
rotation
tasty
drinkable
and
of
an
even
dependable
quality
but
decidedly
less
avant
garde
than
the
brewerys
name
might
suggest
this
is
again
not
a
slight
its
just
a
necessary
remark
in
a
region
that
boasts
such
heavyhitting
tinkerers
and
boundarypushers
as
three
floyds
half
acre
off
color
two
brothers
and
even
when
considering
the
stuff
they
still
brew
in
chicago
goose
island
touted
as
an
english
style
summer
ale
but
i
think
it
is
more
similar
to
american
summer
ales
mild
citrus
aroma
with
a
gentle
hops
aftertaste
golden
yellow
to
straw
color
thin
head
with

the

expected
for
a
simmer
beer
good
and
easy
drinking
with
good
flavor
cross
of
gold

taste
is
sweet
up

with
citrus
hops
and
a
light
herbal
spice
and
sweetness
in
the
back
a
very
good
session
beer
as
well
as
a
great
after
mowing
beer
for
summer
not
the
best
beer
you
ever
had
but
a
solid
offering
for
the
style
o
i
really
like
this
for
what
it
is
nice
complexity
and
flavor
fairly
good
price
id
buy
it
again
if
the
timing
was
right
and
had
a
craving
for
it
overall
this
brew
comes
out
as
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
english
pale
not
as
flavorful
or
complex
as
their
a
little
crazy
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
i
got
this
in
a
bomber
but
a
better
format
would
be
in
a
six
pack
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
and
pleasant
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
a
good
aroma
very
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
worth
trying
edit
i
see
after
the
fact
this
bottle
was
dated
almost
a
year
ago
ill
find
a
fresher
one
and
rereview
o
a
very
balanced
brew
this
is
not
the
most
original
combination
of
flavors
coming
out
of
revolution
but
a
very
enjoyable
one
it
is
citrusy
and
refreshing
while
being
just
heavy
enough
to
have
all
year
round
they
told
me
this
is
the
lightest
beer
they
make
but
out
of
the
20
or
so
that
ive
tried
here
i
also
rank
it
one
of
their
best
22
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on

pours
lightly
hazycloudy
bright
golden
color
with
a
12
finger
fairly
dense
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
foamy
lacing
clings
on
the
glass
with
some
moderate
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
big
orange
peel
grapefruit
lemon
zest
orange
rind
floral
grass
wheat
light
honey
and
floral
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
big
citrus

and
moderate

with
good
strength
taste
of
orange

tangerine
grapefruit

floral
grass

slight

citrus

floral
grass
bread
wheat
light
honey
and
floral
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
complexity
of
citrus
hop
flavors
with
a
moderate
malt
balance
with
good
flavor
robustness
and
no
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
blond
ale
all
around
good
balance
and
complexity
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
a
while
waiting
for
dinner
a
pallet
cleanser
one
of
those
beers
that
i
see
on
tap
everywhere
and
or
some
reason
have
not
had
that
is
my
mistake
dont
make
the
same
one
definitely
the
most
generic
beer
happening
at
revolution
not
a
bad
beer
but
this
one
is
brewed
for
the
much
less
adventurous
palate
not
a
throwaway
but
a
relatively
uninspired
brew
it
is
darker
than
the
standard
golden
with
just
a
hint
of
amber
to
it
and
a
lace
head
an
inch
high
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
mix
of
euro
pils
and
pale
malts
nothing
interesting
on
the
grain
front
the
hops
are
light
as
well
balancing
bitterness
without
nuances
of
any
kind
sort
of
an
oatmealy
sudsy
feel
to
this
one
with
more
body
than
is
customary
and
fine
carbonation
revolution
does
some
really
cool
stuff
but
this
one
is
just
a
beer
to
me
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
my
second
revolution
brew
and
both
have
been
solid
not
spectacular
but
very
good
the
cross
of
gold
was
good
but
i
agree
with
others
this
is
more
of
a
blonde
ale
than
an
english
ipa
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
white
head
that
left
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
was
sligth
bitter
hops
with
a
subtle
waith
of
citrus
the
taste
was
a
very
good
balanced
beer
that
did
not
overwhelm
sligth
citrus
flare
helped
to
give
the
beer
character
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
probably
would
not
go
seekign
it
out
but
glad
i
tried
it
however
this
has
a
vegetal
quality
that
doesnt
quite
sit
right
with
me
t
has
a
dull
bitter
edge
to
it
ill
pass
on
the
next
round
crisp
lightly
toasted
malts
with
maybe
an
apple
tart
flavor
grassy
and
earthy
clean
hop
bitterness
the
hops
add
the
right
astringent
clean
pop
to
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
cleansing
for
sure
o
im
new
to
revolution
but
im
totally
digging
their
stuff
so
far
also
a
bomber
of
this
was
dirt
cheap
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
fruits
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
this
brew
is
not
horrible
but
it
does
not
excite
me
either
its
average
and
deserves
to
be
rethought
perhaps
its
the
style
that
i
just
dont
agree
with
cant
recommend
insanely
smooth
crisp
beer
finds
just
the
right
balance
of
well
everything
not
bursting
with
flavor
nor
is
it
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
just
really
enjoyable
i
could
probably
put
back
an
obnoxious
amount
of
this
if
given
the
chance
and
following
morning
with
nothing
scheduled
i
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
it
o
while
its
slightly
stronger
than
usual
for
the
style
im
labeling
this
a
best
bitter
it
has
the
right
body
and
flavor
characters
along
with
a
great
drinkability
in
other
words
you
want
to
follow
with
another
a
great
take
on
the
style
with
some
great
english
ale
characteristics
dont
drink
it
too
cold
drink
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
a
welcome
suprise
i
normally
am
not
a
fan
of
blonde
ales
but
with
the
hop
additions
this
was
quite
delicious
my
first
revolution
bottle
purchase
may
there
be
many
more
to
follow
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
mainly
gold
generous
2
finger
head
retains
nicely
plenty
of
lacing
left
behind
nose
starts
with
faint
green
hop
presence
and
lemon
sturdy
bread
presence
as
well
smells
fresh
and
tasty
taste
starts
off
with
light
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
fruity
hops
moderate
amount
of
bitterness
comes
through
and
is
countered
by
dry
bready
finish
everything
is
working
in
balance
here
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
character
for
a
blonde
ale
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
a
solid
brew
from
an
amazing
brewery
o
very
solid
session
ale
i
could
easily
see
this
being
the
money
maker
that
affords
them
the
ability
to
continue
to
explore
their
more
experimental
leanings
o
one
of
the
best
american
blondes
ive
had
gotta
love
any
beer
that
references
william
jennings
bryan
amiright
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
golden
brass
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
citrus
i
hate
being
that
vague
but
frankly
the
citrus
smell
was
that
vague
so
light
biscuit
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
lemongrass
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
biscuit
and
citrus
now
mostly
identified
as
a
lemonorange
blend
leading
the
way
in
geminic
yeah
i
just
coined
a
new
word
folks
harmony
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
lightly
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
simple
straightforward
little
blonde
one
i
wouldnt
mind
spending
some
more
time
with
later
o
a
nice
beer
to
begin
your
session
with
or
something
to
recommend
to
someone
whos
just
getting
started
into
craft
beer
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
good
and
works
as
a
more
session
type
beer
it
is
what
it
is
ive
had
this
one
a
number
of
times
usually
when
i
feel
like
bouncing
around
their
beer
menu
for
the
day
and
ive
already
had
their
porter
ipa
and
whatevers
on
cask
the
last
time
i
had
it
i
was
informed
by
my
server
that
the
batch
was
not
only
really
fresh
but
was
a
generation
zero
yeast
crop
the
spankinnew
yeast
produced
a
product
that
was
far
crisper
clearer
and
cleaner
than
any
other
trial
with
this
ale
the
near
absent
bitterness
and
hop
profile
were
suddenly
quite
apparent
and
i
even
detected
some
fun
little
spicy
esters
though
very
mild
nearbrilliant
gold
in
color
and
exceptionally
drinkable
its
downfall
is
that
its
just
not
that
interesting
a
brew
which
is
why
its
also
their
no
2
most
popular
its
the
fun
microbrew
option
for
your
mojito
drinking
gal
pals
though
again
its
not
bad
either
revolution
has
awesomer
beers
but
theres
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
a
good
choice
for
friends
who
arent
beer
afficinados
and
just
want
a
good
crisp
beer
o
a
pretty
nice
beer
that
avoids
being
overly
harsh
and
yeasty
easy
to
drink
with
good
flavor
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
its
a
style
that
isnt
one
of
my
preferred
pours
a
fairlylight
golden
color
with
a
singlefinger
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
falls
into
a
thin
collar
the
nose
is
a
bit
light
and
then
hits
fairly
well
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
resembling
the
better
versions
of
the
style
that
ive
encountered
milt
citrus
with
a
bit
of
tangerine
the
flavor
is
slightlysweet
with
a
very
mild
malt
character
as
well
as
a
touch
of
hop
flavor
light
body
with
slight
bitterness
and
a
very
slight
sweetness
as
well
really
quite
drinkable
overall
wow
what
a
great
golden
ale
this
is
typically
a
boring
style
in
my
opinion
but
this
one
was
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
feel
is
ok
not
as
watery
ad
zid
expect
pretty
drinkable
i
struggled
with
this
review
because
while
the
beer
is
not
my
favorite
it
is
wellmade
and
should
appeal
to
the
majority
of
beer
drinkers
out
there
i
dont
want
to
discourage
anyone
from
trying
it
but
i
want
to
help
fellow
beer
advocates
make
an
eductaed
decision
when
choosing
what
to
enjoy
since
im
the
first
person
reviewing
this
beer
feel
free
to
take
what
i
say
with
a
grain
of
salt
when
i
first
had
this
beer
i
thought
i
was
drinking
an
ipa
my
server
told
me
that
its
actually
a
lager
which
is
brewed
with
a
bit
of
hops
needless
to
say
i
thought
that
it
had
more
than
a
bit
of
hops
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
you
will
find
enjoyable
if
you
dont
mind
what
would
seem
like
a
miscategorization
i
rated
this
beer
highly
because
i
liked
it
even
though
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
what
the
brewers
call
an
american
paleblonde
ale
on

what
starts
toward
a

ale
finds
a

with
earthy
hops
and

for
me
just
reading
others

and
i
find
that
im
not
alone
maybe
many
bad
batches
but
more
likely
just
a
crappy
beer
avoid
o
flavors
are
light
overall
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
as
far
as
epas
go
this
is
pretty
solid
disappointed
on
the
abv
the
beer
really
is
unique
and
flavorful
there
is
obvious
pride
with
this
recipe
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
on
the
sweet
side
very

also

after

very

with
just
a
touch
of
sweet

notes
and
some
light

taste
was
biscuity

just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
the
same
wood
flavor
as
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
kinda
thick
pretty
easy
drinker
overall
this
one
is
ok
not
great
just
ok
an
english
premium
bitter
and
not
a
good
one
at
that
this
uses
oaks
barrels
and
i
can
find
an
austere
vanilla
thread
if
i
look
for
it
but
its
not
saving
the
beer
this
maybe
made
sense
in
1996
but
its
kinda
dull
and
aimless
now
3
5
overall
good
beer
nothing
over
the
top
but
good
o
this
one
is
from
right
in
my
backyard
but
i
cant
say
its
one
of
my
favorites
not
bad
by
any
means
though
o
its
a
super
easy
drinker
sweet
and
crisp
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
though
almost
tastes
like
corn
but
as
mentioned
its
very
easy
to
drink
id
prefer
a
little
more
of
the
biscuity
flavors
in
here
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
but
its
ok
supremely
average
and
easy
to
drink
taste
malty
but
generally
hoppy
and
a
bit
thin
id
say
that
this
is
more
of
an
esb
than
an
english
pale
ale
either
way
it
is
very
very
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
really
good
surprisingly
complex
in
a
subtle
way
with
wood
nut
hop
and
toasty
malt
in
good
balance
generally
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
very
tasty
plenty
of
different
flavors
pop
up
without
any
one
of
them
overpowering
3

overall
a
decent
beer
but
far
from
my
favorite
pale
ale
as
well
that
said
it
still
is
a
solid
session
beer
o
leans
a
good
bit
on
the
toasty
malt
character
and
decidedly
rigid
dryness
with
mild
touches
of
sweetness
woody
bitterness
and
faint
fruitiness
giving
it
just
enough
dimension
and
shape
to
keep
it
interesting
but
allinall
this
is
a
fantastically
easydrinkinginhighvolume
ale
overall
this
reminds
me
an
awful
lot
of
a
marzen
festbier
toasty
and
malty
but
with
heavier
alelike
yeast
qualities
instead
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
lagerlike
drinkability
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
if
youre
feeling
like
an
easy
to
drink
maltforward
brew
overall
the
barrel
characteristics
make
this
interesting
and
deters
it
from
being
another
runofthemill
english
pale
ale
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
between
the
malt
and
bitterness
id
really
like
to
try
this
caskconditioned
o
very
very
good
beer
more
body
would
have
put
it
over
the
top
for
me
but
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
summer
day
drinks
very
easy

this

not
a
great
beer
but
firestone
walker
gets
all
due
credit
for
giving
us
something
just
a

different

dark
copper
with
an

has
an
odd
smell
to
me
but
is
floral
and
maybe

taste
off

id
hoppy
with
a
light
bite
this
does
leave
an
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
not
terrible
but
nothing
really
special
i
expected
a
bit
more
but
bought
this
in

to
a
sweet
chorus
of
caramel
malts
intermingling
with
just
a
hint
of
oak
and
biscuit
and
just
a
little
vanilla
as
well
too
on
the
finish
its
all
perceptible
and
makes
for
a
pretty
interesting
and
well
rounded
epa
overall
very
well
done

the
english

a

sneaks
in

the

not

very

beer
than
be
quaffed
in
certain
circumstances
but
not
one
after
the
other
one
of
the
best
firestones
ive
had
theyve
got
the
english
esb
style
down
pat
in
this
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
but
this
is
s
very
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
beer
very
approachable
and
tons
of
flavor
for
5
abv
o
a
solid
english
pale
ale
contains
the
minimum
necessary
components
but
a
bit
thin
and
low
on
most
characteristics
drinkable
but
not
at
all
interesting
poured
from

into

not
a
strong

dark
copper
in

low
carbonation

vanilla
and
oak
flavors
flavor
over
hops
not
terribly
strong
dry
finish
not
a
strong
after
taste
first
time
with
this
brewer
and
really
enjoyed
it
overall
one
of
the
better
english
pale
ales
i
have
had
in
a
while
on
the
sweeter
side
but
i
can
still
make
out
the
pale
malts
this
could
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
overall
a
good
and
thirst
quenching
pale
ale
light
mouthfeel
but
flavors
are
still
prominent
with
a
nicely
bitter
and
slightly
dry
finish
a
decent
and
sessionable
ale
the
taste
really
echoes
the
aroma
and
that
aroma
announces
itself
with
every
sip
sweet
roasted
caramel
malts
are
the
key
thing
with
a
shortlived
bitterness
on
the
backside
a
decent
rendition
of
the
style
o
it
speaks
softly
but
has
a
lot
to
offer
very
light
and
drinkable
it
just
lacks
the
seamless
flow
that
would
take
it
to
the
next
level
o
its
a
very
solid
easy
drinking
ale
that
packs
a
nice
clean
flavour
nice
american
take
on
english
bitter
tasty
but
still
mellow
malty
but
well
balanced
with
a
relatively
decent
amount
of
hops
amber
copper
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
with
sweet
breads
and
a
touch
of
fruit
more
malt
than
hop
character
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
a
tad
syrupy
fairly
light
in
body
with
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
mediocre
reminds
me
of
something
fullers
would
brew
and
is
a
very
fine
example
of
an
american
brewerys
take
on
the
style
oda
very
easy
going
beer
its
relaxed
and
sessionable
i
feel
as
though
i
wouldnt
have
appreciated
it
earlier
in
my
beer
drinking
experience
i
enjoy
the
subtle
nuances
of
this
beer
pours
copper
color
looks
more
like
honey
slightly
hazy
finger
width
foamy
head
with
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
weak
though
not
much
there
slightly
bitterhoppy
smell
but
cant
discern
many
fruit
flavors
smooth
malty
taste
with
mod
bitterness
at
the
end
slightly
hoppy
hoppy
aftertaste
is
very
light
maybe
a
slight
citrus
taste
but
otherwise
just
malty
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
would
drink
again
but
would
buy
the
pale
31
instead
odecent
beer
but
wont
knock
your
socks
off
simple
and
easy
to
drink
o
not
sure
of
ive
had
too
many
of
this
style
its
fairly
good
id
say
try
it
at
least
once
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
barrel
aging
has
rounded
out
and
mellowed
the
hops
but
this
is
pretty
delicious
and
solid
very
traditional
with
other
epas
o
reviewed
from
notes
taken
on
3614
beer
focused
more
on
malt
flavors
than
depth
of
hop
flavors
still
a
very
good
beer
o
a
good
english
pale
i
would
have
rather
the
malt
was
more
caramellow
and
prominent
so
as
such
this
would
not
be
a
top
choice
for
me
but
it
is
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
i
wish
there
had
been
a
date
listed
after
the
words
bottled
on
hard
to
say
where
were
at
here
sure
this
qualified
as
a
session
beer
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
while
not
on
the
level
or
fullers
this
beer
was
pretty
easygoing
and
wouldnt
offend
anyone
who
would
enjoy
this
style
not
oily
overly
bitter
strong
cloying
or
sticky
there
was
just
enough
bitterness
here
to
remind
me
of
what
kind
of
beer
this
was
even
if
there
wasnt
anything
particularly
noteworthy
or
memorable
about
it

overall
a

though
ill
keep
this
option
in
my
pocket
when
im
looking
for
an
english

experience
which
is
fairly
often

difficulty
picking
up
the

subtleties
that
describe
this

estery
up

with
clean
finish
decent
beer
could
drink
a
few
back
to
back
i
tasted
it
along
side
of
the
firestone
union
jack
ipa
and
preferred
the
dba
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
ohas
some
good
balance
that
does
not
hit
with
just
one
flavor
could
drink
this
all
night
o
a
good
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
have
any
characteristics
that
will
have
me
seeking
it
out
ill
probably
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
since
ive
had
it
before
and
see
if
my
opinion
changes
overall
i
wish
i
had
noticed
the
date
before
i
bought
but
it
was
refrigerated
okay
though
appropriate
to
the
style
overall
a
bit
too
hay
and
grassy
like
for
the
style
with
a
slightly
off
flavor
profile
that
ends
up
creating
a
rather
harsh
taste
not
one
i
would
recommend
o
this
is
just
a
very
simple
beer
not
much
going
on
drinkable
but
very
little
flavor
profile
o
goes
down
smooth
in
a
glass
but
i
prefer
it
directly
from
the
bottle
it
seems
to
retain
more
of
its
flavor
that
way
this
beer
has
caramelized
malt
of
an
english
bitter
with
the
hop
bite
of
an
american
pale
ale
very
easy
to
drink
full
bodied
with
a
decent
carbonation
not
complicated
bitter
swallow
with
a
lengthy
aftertaste
had
this
on
tap
at
a
thai
restaurant
in
san
diego
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
light
wet
dog
and
some
caramel
malts
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
there
flavor
follows
with
big
time
malt
kicks
caramel
biscuits
with
some
definite
pine
bitter
to
balance
alongside
mostly
highlighting
the
malts
but
definitely
not
a
super
sweet
beer
slick
mouthfeel
with
mediumtohigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
pretty
bold
for
the
style
nice
amber
color
completely
transparent
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
very
malt
forward
aroma
on
this
brew
it
smells
like
fresh
mash
with
some
very
apparent
yeasty
characteristics
i
didnt
really
pick
up
on
any
hops
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
mellow
it
would
be
a
good
session
ale
not
particularly
exciting
but
very
refreshing
o
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
when
it
was
first
released
my
memory
is
of
a
creamy
smooth
authentic
englishtype
ale
today
it
is
nothing
special
o
it
smells
and
tastes
good
but
the
mouthfeel
is
severely
lacking
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
o
yea
it
pretty
much
sucks
i
was
expecting
something
after
ddba
but
whatever
they
cant
all
be
winners
can
they
overall
a
standard
sessionable
psle
ale
very
nice
give
it
a
go
check
it

the

with

and
a

the
whole
experience
is
pleasant
if
not
exactly
memorable
its
a
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
poured
into
a
pint

probably
not
get
it
again
another
well
made
product
from
firestone
o
this
is
a
simple
style

they
do
it
well
easy

well
balanced

i
like
this
one
but
its
not
one
of
my
two
of
three
favorites
taste
is
mild
and
balanced
it
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
light
caramel
biscuits
and
some
apple
it
is
a
beer
that
kind
of
reveals
its
self
slowly
mouth
is
decent
but
thins
a
bit
in
the
end
a
fantastic
example
of
a
traditional
english
pale
ale
the
oak
fermentation
really
sets
it
apart
of
other
examples
of
the
style
that
said
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
to
begin
with
because
of
its
residual
sweetness
i
cant
think
of
another
english
pale
ale
that
is
better
done
than
this
so
if
you
havent
had
it
definitely
check
it
out
pours
orange
amber
with
perfect
clarity
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
creamy
head
of
foam
falls
to
a
slight
ring
and
leaves
a
film
on
top
nose
has
plenty
of
vanilla
hop
floral
and
sweet
biscuit
malt
taste
is
grassy
sweet
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
herbal
the
vanilla
is
rich
a
bit
of
dryness
takes
the
creamy
soft
finish
on
this
one
malty
earthy
subdued
hops
slight
bitterness
its
a
little
too
rich
for
a
pale
ale
imo
but
much
better
than
the
one
i
had
that
was
stale
a
good
representation
of
the
english
ale
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
english
style
pales
ive
had
in
recent
times
more
good
stuff
from
firestone
walker
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
for
firestone
they
have
much
better
in
their
family
of
beer
not
much
bang
for
the
price
o
this
lager
its
really
a
lager
folks
is
in
dire
need
of
ingredients
quantity
quality
needs
them
both
this
glass
tastes
empty
and
devoid
of
flavor
nothing
complex
little
character
o
a
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
but
im
definitely
not
sad
im
drinking
this
while
i
dont
tend
to
like
many
english
pale
ales
based
on
a
small
sample
space
im
finding
this
interpretation
of
the
style
to
be
enjoyable
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
its
own
good
and
the
hop
bitterness
is
left
wanting
for
its
style
perhaps
this
is
just
a
consequence
of
the
4monthold
bottle
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
fresher
o
might
be
the
best
american
made
english
pale
ale
on
the
market
might
be
the
most
underrated
beer
firestonewalker
puts
out
great
stuff
peace
a
great
easy
drinking
session
beer
from
firestone
walker
i
know
some
people
dog
on
this
beer
but
i
quite
liked
it
the
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
light
i
detected
some
toffee
and
earthy
hops
with
a
slight
fruitiness
it
tastes
mostly
of
earthy
hops
with
some
lemon
and
caramel
on
the
finish
it
has
a
light
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
satisfying
finish
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
doesnt
stand
out
too
much
from
other
english
pale
ales
id
like
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
o
this
brew
has
session
written
all
over
it
due
its
low
abv
light
body
and
well
balanced
flavors
its
remarkably
unremarkable
in
a
great
way
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
i
have
two
guns
one
for
each
of
ya
classic
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
rustybronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
biscuit
flowers
very
light
seaweed
and
a
kiss
of
honey
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
slightly
stronger
and
breadier
malt
backbone
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
and
easygoing
little
brew
something
i
could
easily
see
downing
a
sixer
of
every
now
and
again
whilst
relaxing
c
medium
body
decent
carbonation
chewy
and
refreshing
many
of
fws
offerings
are
on
the
aggressive
inyourface
side
of
the
barometer
so
this
milder
ale
is
a
nice
break
although
its
still
a
bit
plain
for
me
othis
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
from
appearance
to
feel
there
is
nothing
outstanding
or
noteworthy
i
would
say
this
was
a
decent
session
type
beer
but
it
is
surprisingly
fullbodied
which
hurts
the
drinkability
factor
put
simply
there
are
better
choices
out
there
overall
very
good
high
quality
english
style
pale
ale
amber
with
lots
of
rising
bubbles
and
a
persistent
creamy
head
smell
is
subtle
caramel
and
toasty
malts
faint
hops
in
there
somewhere
i
love
the
caramel
flavors
and
breadiness
of
this
beer
hops
are
rather
mild
in
character
but
provide
a
fine
bitter
balance
i
would
like
a
little
less
toast
in
the
flavor
however
mouthfeel
is
excellent
fluffy
with
soft
bubbles
and
a
nottooheavy
or
thick
body
this
is
a
very
english
tasting
pale
i
really
like
it
overall
drinkability
its
allright
went
well
with
sliders
at
the
bar
while
i
worked
above
average
but
nothing
really
deep
in
flavor
nice
looking
beer
though
drinkability
is
above
average
not
a
lot
of
selection
at
the
bar
so
it
was
easy
to
have
another
without
noticing
its
more
hoppy
than
a
typical
english
pale
ale
and
it
has
more
citrus
bite
than
i
was
expecting
for
an
english
pale
but
as
i
said
in
the
taste
comments
above
its
like
a
west
coat
take
on
an
english
pale
ale
and
it
works
not
amazing
but
definitely
above
average
and
worth
a
try
however
their
brewery
sounds
like
it
would
be
a
fun
tour
oa
high
quality
beer
that
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
but
not
fws
best
offering
o
caramel
malts
makes
this
not
my
cup
of
tea
however
i
would
not
object
to
being
served
one
by
any
means
i
thought
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
great
taste
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
i
love
this
the
barrel
treatment
is
so
delicate
but
works
very
well
almost
like
a
burton
ale
really
an
excellent
example
of
a
bitter
or
english
pale
ale
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
cask
as
is
still
excellent
o
the
head
and
lacing
were
disappointing
but
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
nice
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
is
wellbalanced
but
not
forceful
in
aroma
or
flavor
its
a
nice
alternative
and
like
i
said
above
unique
worth
a
try
for
sure
wonder
how
this
compared
to
other
barrel
aged
varieties
by
firestone
walker
cheers
beer
pours
an
perfectly
transparent
but
extremely
carbonated
amber
color
with
nearly
no
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
rich
toffee
but
neither
hops
nor
barrels
flavor
brings
out
classic
english
bitterale
flavors
and
a
really
nicely
rounded
touch
of
oak
definitely
crisp
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
superbly
balanced
ale
and
if
youve
got
any
affinity
for
english
style
ale
this
is
a
great
choice
if
you
can
forgive
the
carbonation
which
in
the
case
of
this
22
is
too
high
for
the
style
i
bet
it
would
be
something
on
cask
though
d
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
i
wish
there
was
a
stronger
pine
or
grapefruit
note
to
offset
the
dominant
bready
malt
character
im
a
bit
surprised
that
the
oak
doesnt
shine
through
so
strongly
o
its
ok
in
the
sea
of
hoppy
themed
beers
this
one
gets
lost
in
the
tide
for
me
o
actually
a
stunning
beer
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
i
have
ever
had
actually
had
to
open
another
one
while
writing
this
because
the
first
one
disappeared
so
fast
easier
to
throw
back
than
bmclite
but
with
great
flavor
nonetheless
love
it
to
me
dba
offers
something
different
and
it
is
an
exceptional
beer
very
attractive
beer
with
a
subtle
oak
nature
that
really
plays
well
on
this
style
however
the
hops
are
taking
only
a
balancing
role
here
and
i
personally
think
that
they
should
dial
up
the
english
hops
maybe
use
fuggle
at
the
end
of
the
boil
that
would
make
for
a
better
english
pale
though
i
cant
argue
with
what
their
doing
since
they
have
won
a
ton
of
awards
from
this
beer
keep
doin
what
youre
doin
guys
o
i
would
not
get
this
beer
again
there
is
nothing
that
is
great
about
this
beer
overall
definitely
overpaid
at
4
dollars
for
the
single
but
damn
even
for
a
simple
english
pale
ale
these
guys
make
a
tasty
ale
worth
trying
o
on
the
one
hand
this
didnt
wow
me
on
the
other
hand
of
the
english
pale
ales
that
ive
had
this
is
probably
the
one
ive
enjoyed
the
most
so
take
it
from
an
american
ipadipa
drinker
this
was
very
pleasant
and
had
a
strong
malt
backbone
that
revealed
itself
as
the
beer
continued
to
warm
12oz
bottled
on
122612
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
excellent
clarity
nice
lacing
as
the
head
fades
aromas
are
breast
malt
herbal
hop
caramel
earthy
tastes
are
a
nice
balance
of
earthy
herbal
hops
caramel
brown
sugar
mild
spicy
finish
with
a
hint
of
toasted
oak
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
allows
for
palate
coverage
and
optimum
flavor
profiles
overall
ample
bitterness
with
a
nice
malty
sweetness
and
a
clean
finish
another
well
executed
beer
from
firestonewalker
the
verdict
i
like
it
a
solid
pale
ale
to
sip
with
your
meal
or
great
to
throw
back
a
few
after
work
pours
a
deep
brown
to
amber
color
really
looks
nice
some
carbonation
and
just
a
little
lacing
smell
is
fairly
regular
ale
with
maybe
a
hint
of
smoke
coming
through
taste
starts
with
strong
ale
flavors
some
darker
malts
but
then
the
oak
definitely
brings
through
a
very
light
vanilla
but
more
smoke
presence
on
the
back
end
really
nice
beer
for
what
they
did
in
this
abv
o
nailed
in
for
the
style
unfortunately
i
am
just
not
a
die
hard
fan
for
the
style
its
a
solid
beer
no
doubt
about
it
but
not
my
favorite
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
having
never
had
a
firestone
walker
beer
before
i
had
high
hopes
this
may
not
have
been
the
place
to
start
this
is
an
extremely
pedestrian
offering
that
really
does
not
do
anything
special
i
would
certainly
not
turn
this
down
if
offered
me
but
i
also
would
not
actively
seek
it
out
again
given
that
fw
does
not
distribute
to
wisconsin
this
choice
will
not
even
be
available
to
me
i
will
not
judge
fw
based
on
this
beer
alone
as
it
does
not
have
a
great
pedigree
as
it
is
1420
overall
a
nice
complex
beer
which
drinks
like
it
might
as
well
have
come
from
the
fullers
stable
o
a
great
pale
with
all
the
flavor
and
maltiness
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
bread
like
maltiness
than
i
like
but
very
balanced
fruity
and
pleasant
cheers
o
the
flavors
do
well
together
but
as
a
whole
this
brew
is
somewhat
pedestrian
with
no
real
exceptional
moments
but
overall
double
barrel
remains
a
satisfactory
representation
of
the
english
pale
ale
overall
from
the
nose
to
palate
there
is
a
little
bit
of
minor
disappointment
but
its
still
a
very
solid
beer
o
a
very
good
allaround
brew
thats
spot
on
for
the
style
excellent
balance
makes
for
easy
drinking
vanilla
upfront
it
has
this
kind
of
bourbonesque
approach
to
it
the
vanilla
just
grows
and
grows
until
it
overtakes
the
aftertaste
and
that
is
all
i
can
taste
light
in
body
and
a
smooth
carbonation
make
this
quite
quaffable
but
overall
i
dont
really
care
for
it
o
this
was
a
really
good
easy
drinking
beer
i
have
not
really
tasted
a
beer
like
this
actually
i
dont
think
i
have
had
many
english
pale
ales
very
balanced
crisp
drinking
and
sessionable
another
beer
ordered
online
thats
almost
four
months
old
and
that
tastes
fadedoutbakedout
was
it
too
hot
on
the
long
transit
route
maybe
is
it
the
age
both
i
dont
know
but
this
tasted
like
nothing
a
real
disappointment
giving
placeholder
scores
until
i
can
retry
a
fresher
bottle
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
fizzy
carbonation
a
slick
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
malty
finish
that
goes
down
fast
and
easy
this
is
a
very
basic
beer
but
man
it
went
down
so
quick
and
smooth
that
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
oddly
boring
from
firestone
walker
but
still
extremely
refreshing
and
easy
to
quaff
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
gets
better
as
you
drink
would
make
a
great
session
o
well
brewed
solid
pale
ale
definitely
of
the
english
variety
showing
more
balance
and
malt
forwardness
than
a
typical
american
version
of
the
style
somewhat
light
mild
easy
drinking
good
sessionable
pale
ale
probably
not
going
to
satisfy
the
hopheads
out
there
but
malty
beer
lovers
will
enjoy
and
it
seems
to
be
an
approachable
beer
for
the
newbie
craft
drinkers
as
well
12

with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice

that
lasts
good
foamy

clings
to
the

aromas
of
caramel
toast

nice

is

this
is

nice
flavor

with
a
good
amount
of
fairly
robust
flavor
extremely
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyable
buttery
thats
a
description
for
this
type
of
brew
i
can
see
it
i
can
also
see
the
sometimes
nutty
description
also
no
head
to
speak
of
from
my
bottle
nothing
special
regarding
any
kind
of
lacing
sweet
smell
up
front
sweet
taste
up
front
some
caramelly
towards
the
back
and
voila
a
decent
sessionable
brew
at
5
theyre
playing
it
safe
and
able
to
sell
six
packs
nationwide
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
light
to
mdium
body
i
little
extra
something
thrown
in
there
a
slightly
exotic
hop
maybe
to
give
it
a
slight
foreign
twang
and
this
ones
a
winner
with
some
good
marketing
they
ought
to
be
able
to
stock
shelves
within
a
good
1500
mile
radius
not
a
bad
brew
something
i
could
drink
maybe
3
of
before
looking
for
the
chips
and
dip
o
solid
interesting
and
worth
checking
out
easy
drinking
well
balanced
beer
that
still
offers
a
pleasant
array
of
flavors
22oz
bottle
pours
a
semi
translucent
brownish
orange
color
with
almost
no
head
lots
of
lacing
aromas
of
bread
malts
nuts
and
some
booze
tastes
like
nutty
bread
along
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
some
floral
hop
flavor
tastes
a
bit
boozey
which
is
surprising
considering
the
abv
is
5
but
that
most
likely
comes
from
the
barrel
either
way
it
works
well
juicy
mouthfeel
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
the
more
i
sip
this
one
the
more
im
liking
it
worth
having
again
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
one
and
half
finger
offwhite
head
a
bit
of
lacing
is
evident
as
the
head
slowly
recedes
a
pleasant
aroma
of
subtle
oak
light
notes
of
vanilla
and
hints
of
caramel
very
unique
mouthfeel
slightly
syrupy
on
the
edges
that
lends
to
a
brew
that
is
fairly
medium
bodied
especially
for
a
pale
ale
however
the
carbonation
is
crisp
and
clean
extremely
smooth
coats
the
mouth
caramel
toffee
vanilla
charred
oak
herbs
and
flora
and
bread
crust
can
all
be
found
in
this
brew
subtle
but
extremely
complex
frankly
much
more
complex
than
countless
brews
with
better
ratings
this
brew
is
a
true
triumph
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
frothy
head
bready
aroma
and
flavor
the
oak
barrel
smell
and
taste
is
there
but
could
be
stronger
fairly
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
too
nuts
from
the
brewery
that
gave
us
parabola
pale
31
and
the
jacks
but
no
slouch
either
its
probably
the
best
epa
brewed
in
america
you
might
like
this
if
you
want
a
beer
thats
not
too
hoppy
and
with
relatively
low
alcohol
content
think
session
beer
and
you
might
have
a
winner
a
good
beer
for
any
afternoon
palate
starts
with
a
caramel
or
honey
taste
a
little
citrus
and
a
mild
but
pleasant
finish
solid
pale
ale
i
would
drink
again
o
i
much
preferred
this
to
the
pale
31
it
was
very
drinkable
and
the
amount
of
attention
they
pay
to
the
beer
shows
its
wonderful
4
5
toasted
malts
up
front
light
butterscotch
and
appley
fruit
follow
vague
peppery
herbal
bitterness
seeps
in
fruit
and
caramel
stay
into
the
finish
along
with
the
moderate
bitterness
slight
mineral
quality
overall
as
well
as
a
bit
of
spiciness
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
not
bad
another
fine
product
from
the
boys
and
girls
at
firestone
add
this
to
the
highly
sought
after
beers
they
produce
overall
a
nice
beer
from
firestone
walker
i
can
see
many
non
beer
lovers
enjoying
this
one
not
as
good
as
pale
31
which
is
much
hoppier
hence
it
being
a
west
coast
pale
this
is
one
of
the
most
tame
english
pale
ales
i
have
ever
tasted
while
it
should
get
some
recognition
for
being
remarkably
clean
its
not
remarkably
memorable
it
doesnt
really
have
any
flaws
other
than
its
extreme
mellowness
overall
very
well
designed
beer
where
every
element
but
the
mouthfeel
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
beers
like
this
the
flavor
is
unique
and
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
but
never
overwhelming
in
any
way
overall
insanely
drinkable
its
got
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
would
work
well
as
a
dinner
beer
crazy
levels
of
drinkability
a
very
bready
carbonated
take
on
the
english
bitter
not
exactly
as
good
as
others
ive
had
but
still
worth
your
money
if
youre
into
very
malty
watery
beers
as
for
me
ill
probably
pass
unless
offered
one
sometime
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
its
drinkable
and
the
balance
is
there
if
you
wanted
to
grab
something
to
watch
a
game
without
giving
thought
to
the
beer
youre
drinking
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
o
interesting
not
sure
if
this
is
parforthecourse
for
english
pales
but
its
not
bad
couldnt
drink
a
ton
but
to
my
tastes
this
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
and
pleasant
to
me
than
most
authentic
esbs
recommended
overall
this
is
just
a
good
english
pale
ale
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
though
o
very
flavorful
session
beer
well
balanced
in
all
respects
o
great
take
on
the
style
and
i
was
glad
to
try
this
one
dba
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
brew
its
a
solid
english
pale
ale
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
long
o
this
is
a
very
nice
sessionable
beer
the
oak
is
there
but
subtle
the
maltiness
is
upfront
but
the
beer
seems
pretty
dry
overall
and
seems
nice
and
drinkable
not
a
great
beer
but
i
imagine
this
brew
is
flying
under
the
radar
so
to
speak
its
not
really
jumping
out
but
just
sneaking
by
and
riding
the
fw
name
to
beer
menus
and
store
shelves
dont
seek
out
but
deff
the
most
unenglish
english
pale
ale
i
ever
had
conclusion
this
is
a
good
generic
craft
pale
ale
leaning
heavily
toward
the
english
side
of
the
spectrum
i
love
english
pale
ales
and
have
sampled
some
of
the
best
available
in
the
us
and
this
isnt
world
class
it
is
however
true
to
style
and
really
a
fine
drinking
ale
all
told
i
would
never
turn
this
down
and
would
drink
it
over
other
common
examples
like
bass
will
i
buy
it
again
not
at
the
price
i
paid
o
decent
brew
i
think
i
prefer
firestones
pale
31
ale
to
this
one
but
its
pretty
close
good
balance
and
drinkability
the
body
is
light
to
medium
allowing
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
to
come
through
without
losing
great
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
only
slightly
fizzy
and
does
a
great
job
of
assisting
in
the
drinkability
without
being
overly
noticeable
this
beer
is
smooth
and
refreshing
its
medium
bodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
really
feel
it
when
you
hold
it
in
your
mouth
but
it
doesnt
bite
or
sting
it
isnt
sticky
but
leaves
a
little
coating
just
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
is
mildly
drying
pleasant
beverage
for
my
lazy
afternoon
pours
a
copper
ale
with
a
little
chill
haze
that
dissipates
as
it
warms
some
offwhite
soapy
foam
smells
of
mint
grapefruit
and
resin
some
smells
of
malts
in
there
as
well
malty
flavor
with
some
bitterness
and
easy
sweetness
as
a
mangoesque
flavor
then
some
vanilla
hints
follow
through
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
on

on

lively
carbonation
that
falls
short
of
being
fizzy
crisp
and
clean
dry
finish
an
easy
drinking
english
pale
with
a
somewhat
assertive
bitter

and
decent

character
drinkable
not
particularly
exciting
overall
its
a
crisp
refreshing
brew
thats
strong
but
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
to
it
but
its
otherwise
solid
overall
good
solid
beer
its
got
just
a
little
of
everything
youd
like
to
be
there
o
its
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
nothing
mind
blowing
or
anything
but
id
order
it
again
in
a
bar
to
see
if
getting
it
fresher
does
anything
for
the
hop
nose
and
taste
admittedly
i
may
have
a
bias
towards
the
firestone
dba
because
it
was
the
first
craft
brew
i
ever
drank
and
i
lived
near
the
brewery
for
many
years
so
fresh
firestone
was
always
the
choice
at
restaurants
appears
a
classic
pale
ale
coppery
brown
with
a
soft
creamy
head
smell
is
average
epa
but
the
oak
really
stands
out
the
mouth
feel
is
soft
and
smooth
the
flavor
seems
to
combine
a
traditional
english
ale
with
a
cali
pa
to
make
something
memorable
especially
if
you
like
beers
aged
in
oak
the
guys
at
firestone
really
created
an
outstanding
beer
out
of
a
simple
style
with
this
one
certainly
a
good
beer
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
nicely
balanced
a
good
beer
to
introduce
craft
beer
newbies
to
i
suppose
i
hadnt
had
this
in
awhile
and
decided
to
pick
it
up
again
and
see
what
i
thought
overall
its
pretty
solid
but
i
realize
now
that
i
prefer
a
lot
of
other
stuff
by
firestone
much
more
i
can
see
why
they
call
this
an
english
pale
ale
it
certainly
has
many
characteristics
of
one
the
look
is
spot
on
for
the
style
dark
amber
hue
good
clarity
looks
pretty
in
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
medicine
smell
to
it
mixed
with
perhaps
some
herbal
tea
i
used
to
find
this
smell
nasty
but
i
do
enjoy
it
in
some
beers
now
taste
has
a
very
tea
like
taste
some
bready
malt
and
some
slightly
bitter
hops
that
come
through
on
the
end
i
find
the
taste
to
be
very
english
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
but
perhaps
does
feel
a
bit
full
for
the
5
0
alcohol
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
dont
think
its
a
regular
drinking
beer
and
i
think
it
works
better
as
an
occasional
deviation
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
a
decent
looking
head
on
top
the
retention
and
was
nice
along
with
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
in
there
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
solid
balance
also
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
its
something
that
is
easy
going
and
not
too
extreme
doa
this
ones
all
over
the
map
pours
a
brassy
bronzey
color
with
a
one
inch
head
quickly
fading
but
leaving
nice
lace
each
sip
smells
fairly
straight
forward
a
little
malty
but
nothing
unique
flavor
is
not
too
exciting
either
but
it
is
delicious
just
a
well
rounded
glass
of
ale
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
gorgeous
malt
profile
just
the
smallest
sweetness
at
the
end
doesnt
stand
up
to
pickled
garlic
jalapenos
and
okra
but
thats
alright
will
be
buying
this
one
when
i
plan
to
sit
out
back
and
watch
a
long
slow
sunset
over
the
rockies
o
very
drinkable
but
almost
a
little
cloying
its
interesting
how
much
this
feels
like
a
dessert
beer
unfortunately
this
falls
into
the
category
of
very
average
for
an
english
pale
ale
not
quite
sessionable
enough
to
be
truly
great
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
a
favorite
but
not
bad
i
like
my
sessions
brews
a
little
more
assertive
and
a
little
less
balanced
but
thats
just
me
the
quality
here
is
undeniable
o
im
not
impressed
this
is
a
very
mediocre
epa
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
easy
drinking
it
is
as
i
sit
back
and
reflect
to
break
down
this
old
friend
it
all
makes
perfect
sense
as
to
why
this
is
so
flagship
everything
just
comes
together
to
make
perfect
sense
this
is
a
good
beer
that
just
doesnt
know
what
it
is
its
all
over
the
place
and
therefore
doesnt
really
land
among
the
greats
o
not
every
beer
has
to
be
a
huge
in
your
face
dipa
or
ris
this
is
a
good
goto
drinking
beer
o
certainly
sessionable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewer
i
found
the
flavors
insipid
perhaps
because
of
the
style
but
there
are
many
other
sessionable
beers
id
pick
before
this
my
wife
liked
this
brew
quite
a
bit
more
than
me
been
a
long
while
since
i
have
had
an
english
pale
that
i
have
enjoyed
like
this
one
md
the
feel
was
pretty
dim
not
very
lively
yet
it
is
english
driven
so
it
might
be
adaquate
taking
time
with
this
beer
i
felt
that
the
mouthfeel
fit
whatever
firestone
was
going
for
here
while
this
is
not
all
that
jazzed
up
it
remains
a
simple
beer
that
has
some
taste
drinkable
o
while
not
the
best
tasting
it
was
highly
drinkable
and
it
went
incredibly
well
a
solid
beer
overall
looks
great
smells
great
too
i
get
a
mellow
caramel
roast
on
the
nose
and
full
flavors
from
first
taste
warm
pleasant
mouthfeel
muted
hints
of
oakbarrelagingbut
everso
slightly
which
should
be
expected
since
this
beer
isnt
aged
merely
resting
for
a
brief
nap
very
mild
pleasant
some
wellworn
leather
and
light
malts
overall
just
a
wellrounded
smooth
incredibly
balanced
beer
not
big
hoppy
or
otherwise
extremejust
excellent
pours

smells
of
citrus

slight
yeast
hint
of
alcohol
candy
sugar
and
a

the
style
of
an

is
trending
towards
an
american
pale

very

nice

overall
i
am
confused
by
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
actually
i
found
it
overly
sweet
and
not
all
that
enjoyable
poured
a
clear
tarnished
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
a
somewhat
aggressive
pour
gets
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
that
recedes
quickly
with
chunky
lacing
nose
is
earthy
biscuity
malts
taste
is
also
malt
forward
with
a
faint
but
pleasant
hop
finish
malts
are
bread
and
toffee
notes
rounded
out
by
a
nice
herbal
and
tealike
finish
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
light
on
the
carbonation
feels
more
like
and
amber
than
a
pale
and
english
amber
is
that
even
a
style
what
ever
it
may
be
it
is
a
solid
drinkable
brew
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smells
primarily
of
rich
english
toffee
and
malts
taste
is
up
front
a
toasty
biscuity
malt
followed
by
the
herbal
earthy
and
tart
flavor
of
goldings
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
nice
low
carbonation
overall
quite
good
a
pretty
accurate
example
of
a
english
pale
ale
o
good
english
pale
ale
compared
to
many
the
mouth
feel
was
lacking
compared
to
most
american
craft
beer
but
is
still
head
and
shoulders
above
traditional
english
ales
poured
a
bottle
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
even
though
i
do
have
a
fw
pint
but
oh
well
burnt
amber
in
color
clear
with
an
aggressive
pour
yielding
a
moderate
fingers
breadth
of
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
pretty
quickly
simple
aroma
with
a
good
balance
of
caramel
malts
and
grassy
hops
sweet
malts
in
the
taste
bready
with
a
good
balance
of
crisp
grassy
hops
and
some
citrus
pith
a
little
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
nothing
amazing
but
pretty
solid
all
over
lightmedium
body
and
quite
drinkable
on
my
most
recent
weeklong
los
angeles
visit
i
was
looking
for
a
local
six
pack
so
that
i
can
have
a
bottle
or
two
after
work
back
in
the
hotel
i
then
recalled
reading
about
firestone
walkers
union
system
and
i
was
curious
to
try
it
nice
pick
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
one
bottle
made
it
back
to
nyc
with
me
for
this
review
now
i
am
curious
to
try
100
barrelaged
dba
at
their
tasting
room
as
opposed
to
2080
mix
of
barrel
and
stainlessaged
ales
that
goes
into
the
bottles
maybe
my
next
visit
to
california
overall
its
a
good
epa
nothing
thats
going
to
blow
you
away
but
solid
enough
to
go
back
to
anytime
copper
brown
pour
with
minimal
head
but
nice
staying
power
and
slight
lacing
amber
malts
and
soft
caramel
on
the
nose
nothing
memorable
the
taste
though
is
bready
flavorful
and
malt
dominant
some
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
well
carbonated
and
its
a
fine
beer
just
not
remarkable
this
is
a
pretty
decent
epa
overall
a
little
less
tingle
would
be
welcome
copper
penny
colored
booze
with
one
and
half
fingered
of
that
good
old
dirty
white
head
a
little
lace
smell
of
faint
hop
oils
and
some
pale
english
malts
solid
hop
wall
to
start
leads
to
some
lingering
bitterness
a
little
aspen
bark
yes
i
know
what
it
tastes
like
dirt
and
some
basic
malt
medium
bodied
with
a
fuzzy
carbonation
this
pretty
much
sums
up
what
an
epa
tastes
like
o
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
as
a
choice
on
tap
not
cheap
though
its
may
well
be
pretty
much
to
style
on
the
far
low
end
of
the
hop
spectrum
for
an
english
style
pale
ale
and
its
surely
an
adequate
lawn
mower
beer
but
im
underwhelmed
and
wont
likely
be
buying
this
beer
in
the
future
tastes
and
smells
like
beer
nothing
special
ive
had
this
many
times
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
rated
it
about
what
i
expected
with
my
ratings
out
of
the
three
main
firestone
beers
dba
pale
31
and
union
jack
this
was
no
3
on
my
list
really
impressed
with
this
beer
and
wish
i
could
get
it
back
east
o
not
sure
i
would
call
this
a
pale
ale
english
or
not
more
of
a
amber
ale
imo
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
none
the
less
this
is
a
drinkable
if
unremarkable
beer
i
definitely
dont
agree
with
the
english
pale
ale
label
due
to
its
appearance
flavor
and
aroma
this
is
an
amber
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
english
ambers
which
i
would
classify
this
as
so
im
not
the
most
impartial
reviewer
here
not
my
favorite
and
i
would
reach
for
anything
lighter
thats
on
tap
at
the
bar
before
going
with
firestone
walkers
dba
stick
to
pale
ales
fw
its
your
strength
overall
this
is
a
refreshing
session
beer
with
good
carbonation
and
very
little
bite
the
beer
goes
down
easily
and
it
has
a
much
more
refined
taste
that
big
brewer
regulars
o
good
beer
but
nothing
more
i
dont
tend
to
favor
pale
ales
but
this
was
satisfying
i
do
believe
that
its
over
hyped
i
would
tell
others
to
give
it
a
try
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
very
often
overall
not
too
excited
about
this
beer
it
was
decent
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
as
much
malty
sweetness
as
i
thought
also
hoping
for
some
barrel
notes
its
called
double
barrel
ale
after
all
it
seems
like
the
yeast
is
more
dominating
of
this
beer
than
the
malts
the
flavor
opens
with
a
distinct
maris
otter
malt
flavor
earthy
and
a
bit
grainy
definitely
some
heavily
kilned
malt
flavors
lending
a
slight
bittersweetness
a
touch
of
apple
this
is
almost
a
brown
ale
hops
are
light
in
both
flavor
and
bitterness
very
woody
and
earthy
finishes
a
little
dry
with
a
wooden
bitterness
lingers
long
in
the
aftertaste
very
clean
overall
but
the
woody
flavors
make
me
feel
like
im
chewing
on
a
twig
after
the
second
bottle
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
satisfying
level
of
carbonation
not
too
soft
not
too
spritzy
well
made
and
surprisingly
authentic
for
a
burton
ale
copy
marstons
pedigree
would
be
my
guess
but
nothing
that
stands
out
as
exceptionally
good
overall
a
refreshing
pale
ale
o
very
good
beer
much
more
malt
forward
than
hops
balanced
light
oak
character
very
drinkable
d
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
expected
more
out
of
a
firestone
brew
could
have
been
more
flavorful
but
left
my
palate
looking
for
even
an
ounce
of
flavor
i
would
pass
if
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
again
overall
a
great
tasting
great
balanced
and
well
brewed
beer
solid
english
pale
ale
well
brewed
consistent
and
balanced
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
firestone
walker
and
the
trend
continues
notes
meh
it
has
some
typical
english
flavors
but
it
isnt
great
malty
flavors
are
a
little
on
the
strong
side
not
overly
sweet
but
the
flavors
are
imbalanced
ok
sessionable
beer
but
there
are
others
i
would
pick
first
clear
deep
amber
with
a
dense
inch
of
beige
foam
clumpy
and
streaky
lacing
good
head
retention
malty
and
fruity
aroma
earthy
and
lightly
toasted
slightly
herbal
moderate
bitterness
with
a
biscuity
malt
sweetness
a
little
bready
caramel
earthy
and
slightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
finish
low
to
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
decent
texture
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
presence
making
for
easy
drinking
creamy
medium
carbonation
solid
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
a
decent
goto
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
a
steal
at
7
99
per
six
pack
easy
drinking
house
ale
with
nothing
dominating
and
flavor
staying
crisp
throughout
a
great
beer
to
knock
a
few
back
with
a
great
feel
and
smooth
tasting
overall
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
its
a
pretty
simple
beer
but
with
some
depth
to
that
simplicity
my
session
beer
of
choice
these
days
the
carbonation
is
too
high
but
the
finish
is
nice
and
dry
and
very
clean
a
solid
example
of
the
americanized
english
pale
ale
nice
change
from
the
american
pale
ale
style
very
drinkable
and
interesting
label
says
5
1
abv
overall
a
really
good
american
version
of
this
english
style
served
a
little
warmer
from
the
hand
pump
would
be
awesome
o
a
great
sessionable
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
oak
and
hop
character
at
a
lower
abv
session
beer
here
would
love
to
drink
this
constantly
in
the
summer
o
a
very
drinkable
nay
sessionable
brew
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
plus
its
fairly
unique
to
have
a
wood
aged
brew
thats
mild
and
drinkable
i
loved
this
one
it
was
just
what
i
was
looking
for
at
the
moment
i
drank
it
having
had
a
ton
of
aggresive
west
coast
ipas
this
one
really
presented
me
the
variation
i
was
craving
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
usually
flagship
brands
equal
flagship
bland
but
firestone
dba
although
much
subtler
than
firestones
special
anniversary
offerings
is
still
every
bit
as
complex
and
enjoyable
as
those
fantastic
barrelaged
beers
and
its
far
more
sessionable
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
most
people
would
love
to
drink
all
night
long
and
im
certainly
one
of
them
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
particulates
not
much
head
smells
of
hops
and
toasted
malts
perhaps
some
nuts
and
a
hint
of
some
type
of
fruit
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
heavily
dominated
by
the
hops
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
other
flavors
especially
the
toasted
malts
its
pretty
carbonated
perhaps
overly
so
and
a
bit
thin
overall
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
depth
but
is
easily
forgettable
pours
a
light
amber
with
little
head
carbonation
bubbles
evident
the
only
thing
i
pick
up
in
the
nose
is
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
malt
mostly
with
a
tiny
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
heavily
carbonated
t
a
bit
of
a
letdown
bready
and
malty
upfront
followed
by
some
weak
floral
hops
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
rush
back
for
overall
this
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
i
am
supprized
that
it
took
me
so
long
to
review
it
tastes
like
it
smells
tastes
a
little
bitter
with
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
i
think
this
is
one
solid
english
pale
ale
brew
light
drinkable
could
drink
this
quite
often
i
just
never
see
it
around
philly
overall
i
think
the
overall
charm
of
this
one
is
in
its
subtleness
glad
to
have
tried
it
a
slightly
better
than
average
relatively
boring
and
simple
english
pale
o
if
your
looking
to
experience
the
whole
beer
its
not
all
that
but
if
you
really
dont
care
about
looksmellmouthfeel
then
the
taste
is
worth
it
reminds
me
vaguely
of
esbs
ive
been
drinking
for
years
sessionable
but
never
the
main
event
no
real
need
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
o
this
is
not
your
standard
pale
there
are
layers
of
flavor
here
that
a
normal
beer
does
not
possess
there
is
a
toffee
and
malt
backbone
that
really
just
makes
the
beer
and
the
hops
have
an
almost
chocolate
quality
after
that
i
think
the
yeast
and
malt
and
wood
leave
an
original
aftertaste
its
hard
to
find
a
fault
in
it
im
unsure
what
others
are
tasting
but
this
is
really
what
id
hoped
it
would
be
when
i
purchased
it
not
a
ton
of
wood
in
the
flavor
but
certainly
a
great
beer
worthy
of
me
trying
it
and
bluntly
id
be
surprised
if
i
didnt
purchase
it
again
o
devastatingly
average
beer
with
no
hint
of
wood
i
should
probably
be
harder
on
this
beer
given
the
utter
lack
of
woodiness
but
ill
leave
it
asis
its
completely
forgettable
and
lacking
in
any
uniqueness
overall
a
bit
dissapointed
in
this
very
basic
without
and
stand
out
characteristics
yeah
this
is
fine
for
a
beer
this
style
easy
drinking
and
all
that
i
tend
to
like
a
little
more
heft
and
character
generally
or
just
something
with
a
more
pronounced
personality
but
theres
a
place
for
beers
like
this
of
course
over
all
a
drinkable
pale
ale
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
much
more
malt
flavor
than
the
american
counterpart
a
nice
sessionable
english
pale
with
some
wood
complexity
but
nothing
mind
blowing
could
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
and
less
sweet
has
all
the
aspects
of
a
good
english
pale
but
the
wood
notes
throw
balance
towards
the
malt
side
too
heavily
o
pretty
decent
beer
not
overly
impressive
or
something
i
would
have
on
hand
all
the
time
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
worth
drinking
this
has
a
nice
aroma
and
a
pleasant
flavor
it
is
a
tad
on
the
watery
side
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
o
im
really
happy
with
this
beer
its
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
i
will
grab
this
bad
boy
again
and
again
in
the
future
probably
underrated
given
the
expectation
for
this
beer
to
be
a
hop
driven
american
ale
however
this
is
an
authentic
english
style
offering
from
firestone
walker
nice
malt
tea
like
hops
on
the
nose
and
palate
seems
like
ekg
a
rounded
english
profile
firmly
bitter
maybe
some
esters
in
there
maybe
a
bit
too
dry
either
way
this
wouldnt
be
out
of
place
on
cask
in
england
m
a
little
bitter
since
the
begging
and
becoming
more
every
second
it
spend
in
your
mouth
with
a
good
medium
lasting
a
little
dry
with
relatively
high
bitterness
o
a
good
straightforward
drinkable
balanced
ale
solid
seems
spot
on
for
an
english
pale
ale
cheers
o
i
have
been
drinking
this
for
i
dont
know
how
long
have
had
draft
cask
growler
bottle
this
is
just
a
great
offering
from
fw
its
usually
my
go
to
beer
when
shopping
at
the
market
because
they
always
have
it
fresh
and
in
stock
12oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
offwhite
head
low
carbonation
aroma
has
grass
herbs
a
little
bit
of
bubblegum
and
toasted
bread
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
some
caramel
notes
light
bittering
hops
on
the
end
medium
bodied
with
and
watery
texture
finish
is
bitter
an
ok
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
orangebrown
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
nice
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
malts
and
some
fruity
and
floral
hops
taste
is
of
roasty
malts
up
front
with
some
subdued
fruity
citrus
zest
hops
because
of
this
there
is
really
no
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
with
a
creamy
and
slightly
thick
feel
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
this
brew
pours
a
dark
see
through
copper
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
boiled
candylight
toffee
and
some
fruity
hopsit
has
a
light
bodied
averagely
carbonated
mouthfeel
that
has
tastes
of
sweet
caramel
maltsboiled
candyfairy
floss
and
is
finished
off
with
a
fruit
punch
hopppy
light
bitterness
but
not
bitter
at
all
just
bittersweet
and
overall
this
brew
is
alright
without
being
great
and
probably
wouldnt
revisit
anytime
soon
as
there
is
too
much
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
d
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
bready
and
flavorful
nice
simple
session
beer
firestone
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
enjoyed
though
its
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
o
decent
pale
ale
nothing
to
really
complain
about
but
nothing
special
either
good
drinkability
not
something
i
will
be
buying
in
the
near
future
but
i
would
definitely
drink
one
if
it
is
offered
to
me
overall
a
solid
beer
i
buy
it
often
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
im
sittin
on
my
balcony
watchin
my
beer
brew
overall
it
tastes
like
a
toned
down
version
of
their
pale
31
beer
it
has
a
little
bit
more
of
a
biscuity
taste
and
would
work
well
as
a
session
beer
whenever
i
am
out
for
dinner
and
there
is
no
beer
selection
dba
is
always
my
default
because
for
some
reason
its
always
on
the
menu
for
what
it
is
it
is
much
more
satisfying
flavorful
and
goes
better
with
food
than
your
typical
domestic
piss
beer
bud
or
miller
m
d
decent
good
balance
very
drinkable
nothing
out
of
this
world
less
than
1
80
per
bottle
in
singles
at
khourys
or
lees
a
decent
ale
drinkability
its
a
really
fine
unique
ale
with
a
lot
of
character
if
you
like
malts
and
beers
that
harken
back
to
a
more
english
flavor
profile
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
you
wont
regret
it
its
definitely
a
good
night
cap
double
barrel
ale
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
bit
of
white
head
the
smell
is
lightly
hopped
with
east
kent
goldings
and
has
a
good
amount
of
caramel
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
toffee
a
slight
hop
character
and
some
toasty
base
malt
flavor
like
all
fine
english
beers
there
is
just
enough
carbonation
to
feel
it
prickle
on
your
tongue
and
it
has
a
light
body
to
round
things
out
at
first
taste
i
wasnt
pleased
but
as
i
drank
more
i
really
began
to
like
it
i
could
have
drank
a
lot
more
than
just
the
bomber
i
bought
and
now
that
im
back
on
the
east
coast
i
wish
i
would
have
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
not
over
the
top
with
a
ton
of
complex
flavors
at
5
1
these
could
be
a
good
every
day
few
a
day
drinker
with
the
lack
of
complexity
id
lean
on
something
else
if
adventure
is
what
you
are
seeking
easy
drinker
well
balanced
but
not
as
complex
as
others
for
the
price
lots
of
sweet
black
tea
flavor
i
dig
how
much
this
tastes
like
a
british
bitter
to
me
it
tastes
more
british
than
american
so
its
good
to
see
it
rated
as
a
epa
though
its
made
in
the
u
s
smell
is
super
sweet
candy
malt
pretty
thick
white
head
and
a
sweet
syrupy
mouth
feel
once
it
warms
in
my
glass
a
bit
it
does
feel
a
little
thickerheavier
over
all
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
its
nice
to
pay
a
low
price
for
a
export
tasting
beer
d
a
pleasant
enjoyable
pale
ale
not
overly
exciting
but
it
gets
the
job
done
a
pleasant
combination
of
malt
sweetness
and
spicy
hop
character
provide
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
watery
as
mentioned
earlier
but
decent
overall
drinkability
is
average
for
a
pale
ale
as
there
are
others
that
offer
enticing
finishes
and
aftertastes
this
offers
neither
but
is
good
in
its
own
right
not
bad
at
all
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
more
brazen
than
i
prefer
but
i
was
able
to
swirl
it
to
a
more
enjoyable
level
in
hindsight
it
would
seem
the
carbonation
was
the
cause
for
the
disassociation
of
malt
hops
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
at
times
it
seems
a
bit
watery
the
alcohol
makes
itself
known
in
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
warmth
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
is
completely
forgettable
a
good
hop
profile
for
an
english
pale
yet
still
balanced
a
beer
i
would
come
back
to
for
a
solid
decently
flavored
beer
when
i

i
received
this

inadvertently
in

trade
and
really
had
no

in
trying
it

figured
what
the
hell
it
was
about
as
good
as
i
expected

a
little
offwhite

somewhat
sweet
bready
and
biscuity
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
a
rather
pedestrian
amber
ale
suddenly
i
am
reminded
of
all
the
boring
pale
ales
i
had
while
in
the
united
kingdom
and
why
i
am
still
trying
to
suppress
that
trip
from
my
memory
i
see
firestone
walker
is
trying
to
just
that
and
make
boring
english
pale
ale
congratulations
you
did
just
that
but
a
higher
abv
a
solid
english
ale
expect
for
the
higher
abv
sorry
wont
be
buying
this
again
this
might
be
fun
to
have
on
cask
in
my
opinion
drinking
this
beer
cold
is
an
injustice
and
i
wont
make
that
mistake
again
feels
great
medium
body
is
spot
on
easy
drinking
doesnt
even
cover
it
this
is
fantastic
extremely
wellmade
and
delicious
d
overall
it
had
some
great
qualities
i
think
it
might
just
be
a
bit
old
and
doesnt
quite
stand
the
test
of
time
will
probably
have
to
come
back
and
review
a
freshie
at
some
point
pours
a
brownishorange
almost
clear
color
with
a
medium
white
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
some
light
hops
this
is
one
of
my
goto
session
beers
considering
it
is
readily
available
at
most
bars
in
my
area
very
simple
yet
complex
at
the
same
time
the
taste
is
a
5050
mixture
of
hops
and
malts
neither
one
overpowers
the
other
i
get
a
bit
of
caramel
and
flowers
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
that
a
lot
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
had
a
nice
smooth
texture
for
a
session
beer
amazing
drinkability
carbonation
was
excellent
good
mouthfeel
a
very
pleasant
beer
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
kick
in
the
flavor
department
with
a
good
combination
of
almost
heady
malts
with
crisp
hop
flavors
yet
done
at
a
very
moderate
abv
it
is
easytofind
and
affordable
too
visiting
southern
california
and
had
to
try
something
local
so
i
chose
this
at
a
little
bar

out
with

pretty

surprising
to
see
a
5
pale
with
that
much
flavor
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
drink
a
whole

of
eventually
though
youd
want
something
with
a
little
more
kick
d
very
good
drinkability
very
smooth
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
just
have
to
keep
going
back
for
another
sip
there
wasnt
anything
overly
complex
about
this
beer
a
nicely
crafted
ale
this
is
not
distinctive
enough
to
buy
on
a
regular
basis
there
are
far
more
beers
at
this
price
point
with
far
more
flavor
a
tasty
beer
with
just
enough
going
on
to
keep
me
interested
but
a
silky
smooth
feel
and
flavour
that
would
have
me
happy
to
drink
this
for
a
while
i
like
this
beer
its
not
my
favorite
but
for
the
price
at
my
local
stores
and
what
it
brings
to
the
table
for
it
i
stock
this
regularly
along
with
their
pale
ale
and
union
jack
for
a
pocket
forgiving
good
beer
that
delivers
d
good
a
tasty
and
easy
going
beer
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
if
it
were
local
d
goes
down
easily
mild
kick
not
too
filling
not
an
over

beer
but
a
solid
offering
to
sit
with
for
a
while
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
almost
a
bit
watery
tastes
like
a
strange
tea
this
is
not
is
not
so
great
probably
wont
go
searching
for
it
d
goes

quite
easily
could
and
did
drink
several
pints
per
sitting
drinks
middling
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
the
style
but
even
if
i
was
dba
would
be
a
completely
skippable
english
pale
drinkability
well
parts
of
the
flavor
and
experience
arent
my
favorite
but
other
parts
make
up
that
first
sweet
sip
and
the
delicious
creaminess
split
the
difference
id
have
this
again
side
notes
i
asked
the
guy
during
the
brewery
tour
what
the
significance
of
double
barrel
is
apparently
it
doesnt
mean
anything
specifically
its
probably
just
supposed
to
sound
cool
like
a
double
barrel
shotgun
or
something
they
do
put
it
in
barrels
though
also
firestone
beer
is
supposed
to
be
kept
refrigerated
at
all
times
by
vendors
and
they
only
let
that
rule
slide
for
costco
i
happened
to
get
this
beer
from
a

at

caramel

toast
are
well

by

i
really
enjoyed
it
quite
a
nice
pubcask
feel
to
the
beer
this
is
something
i
dont
always
get
interested
in
but
this
one
is
done
up
right
and
uniquely
just
boring
overall
this
beer
is
now
on
my
list
of
solid
beers
that
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
nothing
that
was
over
the
top
superperb
but
drinkability
is
very
high
a
nice
representation
of
style
and
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
pints
of
with
good
pub
conversation
very
drinkable
especially
at
only
5
00abv
id
more
than
likely
find
myself
reaching
for
something
with
a
more
bold
flavor
profile
though
drinkability
a
very
low
key
beer
but
with
great
drinkability
i
could
definitely
come
back
for
more
of
this
one
nothing
standoutish
but
its
a
good
sessionable
beer
drinkability
relatively
easy
to
drink
though
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
firestone
makes
some
great
beers
so
i
may
have
to
try
this
again
sometime
after
i
forget
this
experience
this
is
still
one
i
like
alot
but
so
far
i
like
it
more
from
the
bottle
d
pretty
good
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
deffinately
something
i
could
see
myself
throwing
back
quite
a
few
of
this
is
a
drinkable
english
pale
althought
its
not
the
most
impressionable
in
terms
of
smell
and
flavor
an
interesting
and
quite
flavorful
amberpale
ale
one
i
pick
up
for
everyday
drinking
anytime
im
in
california
the
double
barrel
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
an
off
white
creamy
head
that
slowly
fades
not
much
retention
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
other
than
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
sugar
no
hops
are
noticed
taste
is
refreshing
with
a
light
bitter
finish
plenty
of
malts
to
the
quaff
along
with
some
fruits
and
grains
some
buttered
bread
is
also
present
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
light
bodied
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
none
of
the
characteristics
are
outstanding
but
overall
a
well
rounded
beer
from
a
new
brewery
to
me
thanks
again
flexabull
the
beer
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
a
smooth
maltiness
with
the
smallest
turn
of
hops
at
the
end
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
but
not
complex
in
the
least
goes
down
smoothly
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
d
if
you
arent
into
bitter
beers
and
instead
look
for
something
pretty
malty
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
damn
good
could
drink
a
bunch
not
an
overly
complex
or
mind
blowing
beer
but
solid
and
good
pours
a
really
nice
copper
color
with
a
pure
white
head
about
a
half
inch
really
rather
pretty
not
a
lot
of
scent
what
there
is
is
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
maybe
a
tinge
of
bread
in
the
flavor
it
gets
more
flavorful
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
id
let
it
sit
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
few
minutes
myself
if
i
were
you
enjoyable
nothing
exceptionally
special
but
a
nice
beer
d
easy
enough
to
finish
but
not
the
most
exciting
thing
in
the
world
had
on
tap
served
very
cold
in
a
chilled
mug
so
it
took
a
awhile
before
i
was
really
able
to
taste
it
a
nice
beer
but
not
a
lot
of
intensity
or
complexity
flavors
blend
well
together
but
i
was
wanting
a
bit
more
the
carbonation
is
was
high
for
my
tastes
wouldnt
mind
tasting
again
a
some
point
but
wont
seek
it
out
i
probably
shouldnt
have
had
this
after
a
dogfish
90
minute
pretty
typical
for
an
english
pale
ale
but
its
not
my
favorite
style
good
golden
color
with
very
good
carbonation
i
liked
it
and
would
probably
like
it
better
on
draft
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
havent
before
pint
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
caramel
colored
ale
with
a
beige
small
foamy
head
malty
bready
aroma
with
some
faints
hints
of
citrus
fruits
a
rather
bitter
taste
with
some
mild
grapefruit
coming
through
after
the
swallow
malt
backbone
smoothes
it
out
to
keep
it
from
being
overly
hoppy
carbonated
feeling
stays
in
the
mouth
well
after
the
sip
is
complete
full
bodied
mouthfeel
which
is
nice
at
only
5
this
is
a
good
session
beer
for
someone
trying
the
pa
style
not
overly
bitter
or
malty
right
in
the
middle
unfortunately
there
was
no
wow
factor
for
me
i
like
the
firestone
beers
but
this
one
just
didnt
have
anything
special
to
set
it
apart
from
most
other
pale
ales
still
a
well
done
pale
ale
from
a
great
brewery
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
astringent
and
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
to
medium
full
this
has
got
a
rich
woody
flavor
thats
a
little
out
of
balance
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
one
that
makes
a
super
session
and
shows
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
a
sour
or
big
stout
to
show
improvement
from
hanging
out
in
oak
for
a
bit
its
a
nice
amber
color
not
to
much
smell
taste
is
crisp
with
a
sweet
maltiness
with
just
a
little
bitterness
at
then
end
not
much
going
on
in
the
mouth
but
definitely
very
drinkable
an
easy
drinker
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
hopped
up
english
pale
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
very
tasty
for
the
style
the
body
is
a
a
bit
lacking
the
feel
was
watery
and
theres
wasnt
much
else
in
the
feel
to
distract
from
that
carbonation
is
low
and
only
a
slight
dryness
keeps
me
wanting
more
tongue
coating
and
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
amplifies
drinkability
and
makes
this
beer
and
very
quaffable
one
taste
wood
and
malt
english
style
fo
sho
minimal
hops
especially
when
comparing
their
pale
w
ipa
remains
consistent
decently
drinkable
but
not
my
thing
a
little
pricey
for
what
tastes
like
a
stronger
sam
adams
style
beer
definitely
not
an
american
or
west
coast
pale
ale
flavor
is
pretty
good
nothing
special
though
very
high
carbonation
with
a
light
crisp
body
a
nice
malty
mouthfeel
with
a
faint
caramel
and
dry
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
though
d
super
drinkable
with
the
abv
being
only
5
and
the
mouthfeel
being
so
clean
drinkability
this
will
be
good
on
a
hot
sfv
100
degree
day
its
definitely
a
lawn
mower
beer
for
those
in
socal
unfortunate
enough
to
have
a
lawn
to
mow
not
memorable
pours
a
clear
light
red
color
body
small
white
head
diminishing
english
malty
aroma
dry
hoppiness
some
sweetness
some
citrus
lost
of
dryness
english
taste
pale
and
dry
nice
light
taste
some
sweetness
some
biscuitiness
light
breadiness
tasty
sessionable
not
really
headacheinducing
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
this
is
a
lighttomedium
bodied
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
or
the
nose
at
all
this
is
a
beer
that
is
designed
to
be
drinkable
and
it
is
just
that
but
its
a
bit
boring
appearance
is
dark
amber
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
good
lace
smell
of
lightly
sweet
apples
malt
and
hop
taste
has
a
light
sweet
and
sour
apple
flavor
with
light
malt
and
hop
leaving
a
light
bitterness
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
thats
viscous
and
good
carbonation
nothing
complex
but
still
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
but
not
much
beyond
that
it
does
not
have
any
of
the
complexity
that
i
look
for
in
a
truly
special
beer
d
usually
my
preference
is
toward
the
hoppier
american
interpretation
of
the
pale
ale
but
this
is
a
nice
english
pale
and
its
generally
one
of
the
better
choice
at
restaurants
so
its
one
of
my
more
oftconsumed
beers
on
tap
in
ventura
ca
clear
copper
color
almost
no
head
pale
ale
or
english
pale
ale
very
unassertive
representation
from
the
style
very
little
hops
balanced
more
malty
sweetness
than
anything
else
but
really
so
balanced
that
no
particular
flavor
jumps
out
toasted
malts
maybe
a
little
bread
thats
it
average
mouthfeel
unremarkable
in
most
ways
d
very
sweet
too
sweet
nothing
in
the
hop
characteristics
or
anything
else
is
able
to
cut
into
this
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
nice
identity
of
its
own
however
i
wouldnt
call
it
anything
special
d
if
i
were
to
go
for
a
firestone
beer
my
first
choice
would
be
union
jack
but
id
reach
for
this
one
again
pours
a
cloudy
amberlike
brown
color
with
minimal
off
white
head
and
lacing
the
very
mellow
smell
is
of
dried
grains
and
hops
with
a
faint
carmel
sweetness
taste
is
light
carmel
light
fresh
grains
and
light
bitter
floral
earthy
hops
body
is
medium
creamy
almost
casklike
an
okay
english
style
pale
ale
feels
like
they
are
going
for
a
caskdraft
ale
but
missing
the
mark
on
freshness
as
a
key
for
that
style
thin
watery
and
boring
while
it
is
not
on
my
buy
again
list
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
if
given
one
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
has
a
soft
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
thick
dark
brown
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pale
malt
and
burnt
toffee
aroma
thats
a
bit
sweet
smelling
with
just
enough
roasted
character
if
you
have
the
cask
next
to
the
keg
you
can
really
taste
the
difference
the
oak
works
well
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
my
first
fw
beer
i
like
the
their
use
of
multiple
specialty
grains
as
well
as
the
barrel
fermenting
it
offers
up
an
interesting
tasting
experience
d
a
refreshing
beer
nothing
complex
or
interesting
but
i
can
and
will
drink
it
again
its
a
basic
ale
not
sure
what
the
double
barrel
is
all
about
a
fine
english
pale
ale
the
lion
beats
the
bear
this
time
give
it
a
try
pretty
straightforward
beer
in
terms
of
flavors
toasted
grainsmalts
with
caramel
and
some
bitter
hops
some
earthiness
and
breadlike
qualities
mouthfeel
is
superb
with
some
creaminess
and
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
sessionable
beer
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
foamy
soapy
fingers
worth
of
offwhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
medium
to
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
strong
malty
quality
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
with
a
mild
sweetness
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
faint
lagerlike
honey
sweetness
the
finish
had
a
slight
mustiness
possibly
yeastdriven
stick
to
the
drakes
pours
a
light
orange
amber
color
with
a
full
finger
foamy
off
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
timid
grassy
lemon
citrus
hop
with
an
equally
timid
yet
balanced
earthy
caramel
malt
while
markedly
understated
the
flavor
is
true
to
style
and
matches
the
nose
nicely
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
altogether
watery
adding
little
to
the
overall
experience
very
light
abv
this
one
is
a
reasonable
drinker
slightly
hop
forward
medium
body
with
some
dry
earthy
pine
needle
bitterness
that
lingers
throughout
over
a
prominent
malt
backbone
into
a
subtle
dry
finish
sweet
caramel
toffe
biscuity
malt
backbone
provides
excellent
balance
to
the
earthy
bitterness
the
oak
presence
from
the
aging
is
very
subtle
yet
there
is
a
prominent
smooth
vanilla
character
slightly
watered
down
but
still
very
complex
it
kind
of
tastes
like
abottled
agressively
hoppy
english
cask
ale
d
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
drink
that
i
could
imagine
complimenting
a
nice
hot
day
nothing
outstanding
but
decent
amber
brew
one
finger
head
medium
slow
dissipation
with
some
lacing
sweet
malts
dominate
the
nose
minimal
hop
presence
very
malty
and
sweet
taste
where
are
the
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
central
california
session
ale
not
the
most
bold
of
firestone
walker
brews
but
a
nice
substitute
for
hoppy
ipas
worth
a
try
d
a
really
good
session
beer
with
an
easygoing
style
and
good
feel
with
distinctive
toasted
malt
character
i
wish
the
value
was
better
as
it
isnt
quite
on
par
with
upper
tier
session
suspects
like
troegs
hopback
amber
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
even
sam
adams
boston
lager
mellow
yet
robust
and
drinking
like
a
glass
of
water
yeah
id
say
that
this
being
served
on
cask
helped
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
if
there
werent
bigger
and
better
things
ahead
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
ale
almost
sessionable
although
the
oak
would
start
to
annoy
me
after
a
bottle
or
two
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
and
would
enjoy
again
it
would
probably
pair
well
with
a
mild
cigar
something
i
may
have
to
remember
this
is
a
very
nice
english
pale
ale
from
firestone
walker
wellbalanced
flavorful
and
so
sessionable
i
wish
i
had
another
bottle
picked
this
up
on
a
roadie
back
from
la
went
out
of
my
way
and
went
up
the
101
instead
of
the
5
and
was
extremely
glad
i
did
even
though
it
took
like
3
more
hours
i
love
the
dba
in
12oz
bottles
the
perfect
balance
but
on
tap
in
a
growler
it
was
awesome
kind
of
finished
it
in
about
an
hour
this
is
my
favorite
fw
beer
becoming
one
of
my
standbys
this
beer
is
everywhere
in
central
cali
a
bold
and
very
drinkable
beer
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
a
little
more
hoppy
than
most
epas
but
its
well
balanced
making
it
a
good
beer
to
drink
worth
checking
out
sometime
a
clean
amber
colored
beer
with
a
very
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
light
tracing
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
starts
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
followed
quickly
be
a
nice
piney
hop
character
the
malt
sweetness
brushes
across
the
front
of
the
tongue
followed
by
a
light
tea
like
hop
not
that
changes
to
the
nice
piney
hop
character
on
the
finish
thanks
john
this
beer
was
just
kind
of
bland
for
me
nothing
really
stood
out
it
didnt
smell
that
great
the
taste
didnt
pop
out
at
me
there
was
too
much
malt
for
my
palate
i
wouldnt
say
it
was
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
nothing
special
im
sure
on
tap
it
tastes
a
lot
better
but
out
of
the
bottle
it
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
this
is
a
beer
ill
skip
buying
next
time
drinkability
quite
high
nice
robust
flavors
and
a
nice
blend
of
them
as
well
very
moderate
abv
makes
this
a
potential
session
beer
very
drinkable
the
oakfermented
cask
version
of
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
d
double
barrel
ale
was
a
well
crafted
very
delicious
beer
i
do
not
know
why
this
beer
does
not
rate
higher
maybe
because
it
is
an
english
pale
ale
and
not
an
american
one
but
this
was
very
good
well
balanced
and
fairly
complex
i
would
definately
enjoy
this
again
if
it
was
sold
in
this
area
beer
poured
amber
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
nose
is
malty
sweet
with
a
slight
hop
flower
in
the
background
taste
is
slightly
sweet
up
front
balanced
by
a
decent
amount
of
hopping
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
drinkability
is
quite
nice
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
that
i
plan
on
enjoying
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
im
always
happy
to
have
this
one
around
reminds
me
of
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
in
that
its
always
solid
and
would
keep
it
around
generally
d
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
summer
session
beer
got
this
as
an
extra
and
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
some
time
so
huge
thanks
to
dgb3
for
this
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
flat
very
drinkable
hits
the
spot
tonight
drinkability
overall
a
decent
pa
and
i
would
recommend
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
was
sweet
with
caramel
toffee
taste
was
nice
sweet
malty
but
it
went
down
like
water
very
good
taste
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
and
just
right
with
a
wine
like
texture
a
really
solid
brew
drinkability
i
was
surprised
how
drinkable
this
was
i
couldve
had
quite
a
bit
more
and
not
flinched
at
the
idea
glass
had
to
be
paced
as
i
wouldve
drank
it
much
faster
had
i
not
made
a
conscious
effor
not
to
simply
plow
through
it
went
excellently
with
my
burnt
ends
tritip
sandwich
which
is
also
highly
recommended
if
youre
in
the
area
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
session
ale
that
goes
great
with
some
steak
or
a
burger
and
can
be
picked
up
by
the
case
dba
is
a
great
little
choice
d
a
wonderful
session
brew
a
pale
ale
with
wonderful
balance
where
the
malt
really
shines
through
i
wish
we
loved
in
a
world
where
malt
was
sacrificed
for
overloading
beers
with
hops
if
we
did
this
would
be
much
more
widely
respected
in
the
ba
universe
a
very
nice
english
pale
ale
the
drinkability
is
perfect
for
me
i
was
worried
and
thought
it
would
be
big
and
sweet
and
oaky
nope
its
wonderful
built
with
purpose
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
all
night
unless
i
had
to
drive
fine
but
not
remarkable
flavor
is
more
malty
just
enough
crispness
from
the
hops
to
keep
it
refreshing
and
enjoyable
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
very
good
session
beer
but
nothing
memorable
flavor
wise
solid
beer
and
enjoyable
a
very
pleasant
pale
ale
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
pretty
good
head
the
aroma
is
sweetly
malty
with
some
mild
floral
hops
theres
a
dry
yeast
note
the
malt
has
a
pleasant
caramel
flavor
the
flavor
is
similar
its
a
sweet
mild
pale
ale
there
isnt
a
ton
of
english
character
to
it
in
my
opinion
but
its
still
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
seems
right
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
good
but
its
not
quite
pulling
me
back
for
a
second
bottle
d
this
is
a
nice
english
pale
ale
it
would
make
a
great
session
ale
d
i
really
liked
this
one
and
could
easily
session
a
few
recommended
d
super
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
about
the
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
but
not
so
much
that
its
distracting
medium
carbonation
typical
on
an
epa
keeps
it
clean
and
helps
it
go
down
pretty
smoothly
drinkabilty

a
quaffable
brew
with
mild
leafy
hop
flavors
a
mild
malt
base
decent
i
got
a
big
scottishale
feeling
from
this
one
due
to
its
smokeymalt
charecter
d
right
on
for
the
style
low
abv
drinks
easy
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
d
a
pretty
tasty
beer
all
in
all
i
would
probably
have
a
few
wout
any
problem
of
boredom
a
tasty
session
ale
an
exceptionally
drinkable
session
ale
it
has
enough
complexity
to
warrant
extended
consideration
but
is
friendly
enough
to
share
with
macrodrinkers
i
never
get
tired
of
this
beer
body
feels
like
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
possibly
a
little
on
the
thin
side
fairly
easy
drinker
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
d
decent
beer
very
sessionable
not
something
ill
be
picking
up
in
the
near
futute
but
far
from
a
drainpour
d
at
first
i
wasnt
too
impressed
but
then
i
attended
a
bbq
and
brought
this
along
in
comparing
this
against
a
couple
of
ambers
i
know
this
isnt
an
amber
but
it
shares
some
similar
flavors
the
quality
of
this
one
was
apparent
id
go
with
this
over
some
standard
bbq
beers
anyday
j
no
complaints
with
this
beer
pours
medium
amber
with
good
clarity
good
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
lace
and
leaves
belgian
lace
on
the
way
down
nose
is
somewhat
citrusy
hoppy
but
also
sweet
malty
caramel
more
of
that
caramel
malt
on
the
palate
with
a
somewhat
clean
taste
and
finishes
somewhat
sweet
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
primarily
because
it
is
too
light
and
taste
and
alcohol
but
still
providing
some
enjoyable
components
drinkability
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
refreshing
beer
but
it
is
flavorful
and
filling
id
recommend
to
friends
d
flavorful
but
the
sweet
and
bready
finish
diminish
its
sessionability
overall
a
great
example
of
a
beer
to
watch
a
game
with
not
something
to
cherish
but
rather
something
to
share
bottle
from
our
long
awaited
acquiring
of
firestone
beers
in
washington
appearance
is
a
hazelnut
brown
with
a
small
head
fading
to
just
beer
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
a
slight
amount
of
ale
yeast
taste
is
good
malty
sweetness
with
a
good
hop
backbone
but
nothing
overpowering
mouth
feel
is
slightly
coating
but
leaves
me
anticipating
the
next
sip
overall
drinkability
is
good
for
a
brown
ale
if
i
had
bought
two
of
these
i
would
have
drank
two
of
these
good
medium
to
medium
light
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
it
finishes
decidedly
sweet
and
bready
i
know
this
is
an
english
pale
ale
so
it
should
be
malt
dominated
but
it
just
isnt
working
for
me
but
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
sports
bar
before
my
dinner
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
the
beer
was
the
subtle
fruity
aroma
coming
from
its
translucent
amber
body
the
flavor
combined
a
complementary
balance
of
fruit
and
malty
breadiness
that
was
well
balanced
by
the
subtle
hop
character
the
only
problem
was
that
these
flavors
werent
strong
enough
to
keep
the
beer
interesting
to
drink
carbonation
was
medium
but
suited
the
character
of
the
beer
the
careful
balance
of
good
flavors
and
the
lack
of
any
offensive
flavors
makes
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
a
session
beer
glad
to
finally
have
firestone
available
here
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
shaker
glass
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
around
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
and
flavor
are
a
tad
sweet
malty
earthy
hops
a
bit
of
citrus
just
about
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
for
an
amber
ale
worth
a
try
if
its
available
in
your
area
updated
because
i
struggled
to
finish
the
22
oz
bottle
by
myself
the
lack
of
character
made
it
less
enjoyable
during
consumption
medium
bodied
leaning
towards
fullness
md
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
easy
drinking
an
excellent
sessionable
beer
nothing
too
extravagant
about
it
huge
gateway
beer
great
color
and
taste
always
a
winner
firestone
knows
their
business
its
not
difficult
to
fault
this
beer
for
being
a
bit
austere
and
undramatic
but
its
also
very
clean
sessionable
and
english
traditional
one
of
my
new
favorite
session
beers
firestone
never
ceases
to
impress
me
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
medium
body
and
carbonation
noting
that
as
it
warms
a
bit
on
this
overcast
but
warming
spring
day
the
hop
presence
continues
to
assert
nothing
suggesting
dryhopped
explosions
at
all
but
nice
for
an
amber
ale
recommended
d
very
good
every
day
drinking
beer
ive
had
one
of
these
each
night
for
the
past
three
nights
and
cant
complain
a
good
cheap
alternative
to
all
the
crazy
expensive
stuff
for
sale
in
california
these
days
nice
example
of
the
style
drinkability
sessionable
but
not
a
beer
i
would
want
multiples
of
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
not
particularly
memorable
d
id
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
id
really
like
to
try
it
on
tap
tasty
beer
im
starting
to
like
and
appreciate
ambers
again
ive
really
neglected
the
style
for
a
while
there
are
some
pretty
tasty
ones
out
there
thanks
john
packs
a
bit
of
flavor
in
here
though
is
this
really
supposed
to
be
an
amber
ale
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
some
mild
hop
kick
backed
up
by
decent
balancing
sweet
malt
aftertaste
is
a
little
like
corn
good
mouthfeel
crisp
yet
smooth
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
lets
correct
the
style
though
shall
we
the

itself
even
says

user
friendly
easy

middle

amber
better
than
lots
examples
of
an

your
friend
that
thinks

is

end
will
like
this
nothing
wrong
with
that
here
is
a
solid
pale
ale
from
the
folks
down
the
road
from
me
at
firestone
walker
ive
had
in
both
bottles
and
on
tap
its
actually
a
little
fizzy
but
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
slight
aroma
of
malt
and
a
woody
smokey
note
the
taste
is
a
straightforward
combination
of
caramel
malt
with
a
oak
note
and
maybe
a
little
smokey
earthiness
in
there
its
more
malty
than
hoppy
with
a
little
grassy
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
some
heft
in
the
mouthfeel
and
while
it
looks
fizzy
the
carbonation
level
is
aok
really
went
well
with
my
burger
and
i
expect
this
to
pair
well
with
a
lot
of
foods
d
i
love
session
beers
and
this
is
definately
one
of
them
to
keep
overall
a
great
session
beer
with
a
belgian
quality
to
it
there
is
a
slight
floral
aroma
and
flavor
to
it
looks
great
with
a
dark
amber
color
and
good
head
retention
smell
is
light
again
with
floral
undertones
and
the
taste
follows
i
could
drink
many
of
these
if
it
were
more
my
style
of
beer
but
seems
a
bit
light
so
pretty
much
one
and
done
for
me
now
the
double
dba
thats
a
whole
different
story
the
hint
of
oak
or
tea
finish
slows
down
the
session
average
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
but
nothing
is
glaringly
wrong
ehhh
md
nicely
balanced
and
carbonated
beer
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
drinkability
is
ok
not
really
my
style
of
amber
the
first
time
i
had
this
on
draught
i
was
supremely
disappointed
as
it
was
my
first
firestone
walker
and
i
knew
it
was
their
flagship
this
bottle
seems
tastier
then
my
draft
experiences
but
still
it
doesnt
really
excite
me
too
much
something
about
it
seems
a
bit
much
for
sessioning

d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
reviewing
from
a
whole
sixer
just
so
i
know
ive
gotten
it
right
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
good
strong
redness
and
a
nice
white
puffy
head
smells
of
sweet
biscuity
malt
and
light
green
hops

is
very
smooth
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
mild
caramel
sweetness
and
hop
flavor
mix
well
together
extremely
smooth
drinker
medium
bodied
for
the
style
drinks
very
easily
and
tasty
to
boot
more
tea
flavors
and
just
malt
driven
some
woodsy
notes
and
a
light
date
character
hops
are
floral
and
nature
and
not
very
driven
rs
is
around
2
id
say
and
could
use
a
little
more
balance
otherwise
very
drinkable
with
light
carbonation
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
something
that
is
ok
in
the
drinkability
category
tastes
very
clean
mainly
tastes
of
toasty
biscuit
malt
hints
on
oakiness
low
carbonation
and
very
subtle
flavors
typical
of
english
inspired
ales
that
said
its
subtle
almost
to
the
point
of
boring
though
id
like
to
see
more
flavor
the
sublety
and
cleanliness
of
this
brew
give
it
high
drinkability
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
2
fingers
of
frothy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
nice
sticky
lacing
for
the
most
part

of

of
caramel
and
bread
with
a
touch
of
vanilla

hops

up
in

along
with
a
fruity
finish
of
grapes
mediummediumlight
in
body
with
average
carbonation
sweet
and
bready
with
a
semidry
crisp
finish
an
all
right
amber
ale
but
could
use
a
little
more
hop
presence
seemed
very
overshadowed
by
the
malt
poured
into
straight
pint
glass
poured
with
minimal
head
that
disappeared
almost
immediately
what
lacing
there
was
was
very
nice
and
sticky
no
big
upfront
aromas
just
a
twinge
of
hop
bite
at
the
finish
good
full

very
drinkable
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer

you
were

inside

would
be
a
wonderful
companion

a
22

a

back
a

going
on
in

i
really
enjoy
it

my
goto

even
though
its
actually
an
english
pale
ale
the
flavor
is
simple

delicious

the

light
enough
to
allow
you
to
drink
as
many
as
youd
like

fw
really
excels
in
this
category
with
all
of
their
beers
bomber
pours
amber
with
a
medium
tan

yeasty
stinky

and
with
little
malt
because
the
hops
and
the
malt
dont
overwhelm
you
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium

drinkability
is
exceptional
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
have
around
the
house
and
sip

flipping

this

the
perfect
beer
solid

all
around
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
a
very
good
everydaysession
beer
rich
and
full
flavored
a
little
short
on
hops
but
everything
seems
that
way
to
me
now
i
will
be
having
more
of
this
and
at
5
abv
that
is
easy
to
do
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
nice
burst
of
tight
carbonation
that
races
down
with
each
sip
i
really
do
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
and
it
lends
itself
to
easy
drinking
overall
a
tasty
solid
amber
ale
that
has
a
nice
spicy
kick
to
it
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
at
that
my
first
firestone
brew
makes
me
want
to
check
out
more
of
their
stuff
a
really
nice
beer
to
have
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
that
does
not
have
craft
beers
a
good
standard
in
any
book
d
it
is
alright
easy
to
drink
nothing
amazing
just
a
good
session
beer
drinkabilityoverall
its
not
bad
i
dont
care
for
the
thinnness
graininess
and
lack
of
hop
character
but
i
wouldnt
steer
people
away
from
this
beer
either
d
a
nice
and
drinkable
brew
goes
down
esily
low
abv
smooth
body
not
too
highly
priced
either
as
i
recall
pretty
good
beer
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
depth
and
flavor
in
it
along
with
the
barrel
smokiness
they
are
famous
for
that
elluded
me
when
i
originally
tried
it
im
finding
it
an
excellent
summer
brew
that
is
very
sessionable
and
feel
fortunate
i
have
a
store
that
sells
all
firestone
6rs
at
5
99
this
and
their
pale
ale
will
probably
be
my
go
to
beers
this
summer
quite
drinkable
but
overall
a
rather
plain
jane
amber
i
had
hoped
to
taste
some
oak
flavor
which
never
really
came
through
even
as
it
approached
room
temperature
poured
to
a
hazy
copper
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
aroma
was
a
faint
hoppy
fruit
smell
but
it
was
difficult
to
get
anything
much
the
flavor
waqs
mnore
of
the
hoppy
applecitrus
fruit
but
i
could
not
pick
up
any
of
the
oak
barrel
taste
or
aroma
not
a
bad
beer
though
and
im
glad
i
tried
one
the
drinkability
is
good
better
if
you
need
something
low
key
mk
d
i
could
see
this
as
a
decent
session
brew
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
crisp
and
citrusy
than
a
rounded
off
bitter
style
still
decent
brew
overall
good
session
beer
ive
had
many
beers
and
ales
that
are
better
than
this
one
but
this
is
a
good
choice
if
there
are
no
others
kinda
liked
the
old
slo
brew
better
but
the
brewery
as
a
whole
is
pretty
good
a
little
more
hops
would
have
been
a
nice
addition
poured
a
slightly
hazy
medium
copper
color
with
modest
white
chunky
head
modest
lacing
smell
is
mainly
of
piney
hops
with
a
light
maltiness
in
the
background
taste
is
a
superb
combination
of
malt
and
hops
in
an
exquistite
balance
with
neither
dominating
the
other
finish
is
good
but
not
up
tho
the
promise
of
the
taste
with
the
hoppiness
falling
a
bit
short
all
things
considered
this
was
a
great
beer
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
drinkability
in
my
opinion
there
is
not
a
better
session
beer
in
the
world
not
an
attention
hog
but
goes
great
with
almost
anything
much
better
than
the
tires
if
there
is
a
more
versatile
beer
in
existence
please
tell
me
about
it
a
great
choice
for
when
youre
hanging
with
friends
whose
company
you
enjoy
but
whose
taste
in
beer
could
use
some
finetuning
notes
i
really
couldnt
figure
this
one
out
not
to
say
that
complex
and
confusing
cant
be
good
because
it
most
definately
can
this
is
just
to
much
all
over
the
map
and
the
profiles
are
rather
odd
and
dont
blend
well
not
for
me
recommended
popped
the
cap
off
the
bomber
and
immediately
smelled
oaked
barreling
a
good
sign
hehe
the
appearance
looks
like
stone
pale
ale
a
little
darker
hue
head
is
tall
at
first
but
doesnt
last
too
long
probably
about
5
minutes
max
the
smell
is
awesome
great
oaked
characteristics
and
caramel
backgrounds
with
awesome
spice
hints
the
taste
is
just
the
same
its
like
a
carbonated
oaked
version
of
stones
pale
ale
very
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
perfectly
carbonated
in
my
opinion
the
drinkability
you
ask
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
very
fine
offering
that
i
hope
gets
to
a
wider
market
soon
one
of
my
new
favorite
american
beers
leads
me
to
wonder
what
an
oaked
arrogant
bastard
might
taste
like
mouthfeel
goes
from
full
and
creamy
to
effervescent
and
dry
pleasant
drinkable
and
always
a
pleasure
to
see
on
the
shelves
in
local
supermarkets
which
mostly
sell
the
usual
macrobrews
mild
nutty
character
dominates
the
mouth
which
transitions
into
a
sweet
finish
which
then
takes
a
surprisingly
hoppy
bitter
turn
at
the
very
last
instant
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
quaff
overall
its
a
nice
drinkable
session
beer
nothing
ground
breaking
but
good
d
drinkability
is
good
i
could
guzzle
a
few
of
these
thanks
zorro
d
very
nice
but
a
little
subtle
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
the
oak
adds
a
nice
dimension
a
solid
take
on
the
american
amberred
a
little
bland
for
multiple
pourings
thanks
to
imstillthegman
and
bif
33
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
pours
light
copper
good
dense
head
it
subsides
for
a
bit
lacing
is
moderate
smell
is
faint
a
slight
grassy
aroma
taste
is
slightly
astringent
more
english
ale
type
than
american
ale
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
good
but
the
astringency
is
there
drinkable
well
yeah
seems
sessionable
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
malty
smell
and
taste
to
this
one
more
so
than
expected
its
kinda
caramelvanilla
like
fairly
full
body
nice
and
smooth
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
good
stand
alone
session
beer
or
i
could
definitely
drink
this
one
with
a
snack
or
even
a
meal
there
was
just
something
about
this
beer
i
enjoyed
this
was
one
of
those
amber
ales
that
are
on
the
more
maltyfull
bodied
side
instead
of
having
a
generous
amount
of
hops
too
but
regardless
it
was
solid
the
pour
is
a
clear
deep
amber
the
white
head
has
great
retention
the
nose
has
sweet
malts
grains
and
some
faint
floral
hops
sweet
malts
are
up
front
followed
by
a
fruity
middle
that
owes
a
lot
to
what
i
think
is
englishstyle
yeast
and
the
beer
finishes
with
floral
hops
the
english
character
in
the
middle
is
definitely
the
highlight
nothing
wows
me
about
this
stuff
so
ill
only
buy
more
if
im
in
a
supermarket
with
no
other
good
choices
or
if
im
really
in
the
mood
for
some
that
tastes
english
but
i
dont
want
to
pay
for
fullers
and
the
like
d
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
easy
to
drink
goes
well
with
most
any
food
in
my
opinion
and
relatively
affordable
not
too
shabby
overall
the
first
of
many
beers
received
from
beerrun13
in
a
huge
trade
big
thanks
to
him
for
some
great
west
coast
brews
i
could
never
get
here
very
nice
amber
colorquite
the
white
head
on
top
low
aromasort
of
a
nutty
sweet
malt
smell
toasted
malt
flavors
somewhat
sweet
slighly
bitter
in
the
finish
decent
enough
mouthfeel
above
average
drinkability
but
i
dont
find
this
as
well
done
as
their
pale
ale
i
have
a
second
bottle
so
will
rethink
my
review
when
i
have
that
pours
a
darker
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
didnt
leave
much
lacing
smells
of
toasted
malts
honey
and
caramel
come
through
strong
malt
flavor
with
very
little
hoppiness
noticed
medium
to
full
body
with
smooth
finish
a
little
heavy
on
the
stomach
so
i
guess
about
two
would
be
all
for
me
well
balanced
with
a
medium
body
low
carbonation
pretty
lowkey
beer
not
really
anything
that
makes
you
stand
up
and
take
notice
as
an
american
amber
it
seems
tame
seems
more
like
a
mild
english
bitter
for
my
money
its
pretty
much
middle
of
the
road
drinkability
a
very
pleasing
amber
ale
one
that
is
not
afraid
to
showcase
both
malt
and
hops
recommended
d
perhaps
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
bad
my
wife
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
did
beer
served
in
a
liter
sized
mug
deep
transparent
redish
amber
color
with
a
very
nice
head
on
the
mug
smell
was
nothing
great
some
hops
and
a
slight
amount
of
sweetness
taste
was
similar
it
reminded
me
of
what
a
apa
is
when
it
misses
the
target
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
to
me
drinkability
isnt
bad
its
a
fairly
non
offensive
brew
so
throwing
a
few
back
wouldnt
be
too
difficult
drinkability
easily
sessionable
a
tasty
albeit
common
brew
i
picked
this
up
at
my
local
vons
in
southbay
san
diego
got
home
and
poured
this
into
a
glass
the
pour
gave
me
about
an
inch
of
head
and
the
color
was
a
reddish
with
a
light
caramel
hue
it
also
had
a
sweet
nutty
aroma
and
went
down
very
well
this
reminds
me
alot
of
new
castle
when
i
first
had
that
more
flavor
than
the
one
and
only
imo
better
overall
a
good
beer
i
recommend
it
to
other
ale
lovers
goes
down
ok
but
after
2
of
these
im
feeling
a
little
bit
full
worth
a
try
very
little
head
the
beer
itself
though
is
a
nice
copper
color
with
orange
overtones
the
aroma
is
full
of
malt
and
is
pleasant
although
i
expected
more
hoppy
character
to
it
there
is
some
toastiness
as
well
as
a
nice
full
maltiness
the
flavor
is
also
dominated
by
maltiness
and
has
some
of
the
same
characte
as
the
regular
pale
ale
but
this
has
more
toastiness
and
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
more
hop
character
both
beers
are
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
knock
the
malt
character
seems
both
toasty
slightly
caramelly
and
also
fullbodied
as
well
that
kind
of
german
solid
malt
character
that
reminds
you
of
sweet
without
actually
being
sweet
this
was
good
overall
and
the
malt
character
is
delicious
very
drinkable
although
not
a
hops
showcase
thats
ok
this
is
drinkable
in
mad
gulps
but
its
just
not
living
up
to
my
standards
i
really
wouldnt
even
want
to
drink
this
with
a
meal
i
had
it
at
a
friends
recommendation
but
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
another
friend
not
much
residual
sweetness
leaning
towards
malt
but
a
nice
finishing
bitterness
an
easy
drinker
if
you
dont
want
to
maul
your
tastebuds
easy
to
have
more
than
one
could
go
as
a
session
beer
or
with
a
good
meal
this
ale

for
this
sample
i
had
this
beer
ontap
at
the
westwood
brewing
company
it
poured
a
lacy
white
head
with
a
deep
amber
color
pretty
typical
it
smelled
like
a
light
ale
with
a
hint
of
floral
noted
i
enjoyed
the
smell
it
had
a
great
body
of
smell
with
the
hint
of
hops
hitting
the
nose
almost
spicy
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
and
the
hops
were
present
i
wished
i
had
a
little
more
of
the
bitter
kick
but
the
goldings
were
def
present
which
is
a
great
sign
for
an
english
ale
it
had
a
bit
of
a
fruity
kick
to
it
the
texture
was
smooth
as
it
lightly
covers
the
palate
i
found
this
beer
highly
drinkable
and
have
already
recommended
it
to
friends
who
can
kind
it
on
tap
i
wish
this
were
cheaper
as
it
would
make
an
excellent
fall
back
sessioner
this
compares
to
bass
but
is
better
this
is
a
british
pale
ale
despite
others
believing
it
is
an
amber
amber
merely
describes
the
color
website
says
all
imported
malt
and
hops
the
result
is
apparent
in
the
taste
it
is
more
of
a
lowkey
session
beer
highly
drinkable
the
oak
fermentation
also
contributes
a
smoothness
and
sweetness
to
the
beer
very
enjoyable
overall
just
an
average
amber
definitely
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
try
red
tail
boont
or
red
nectar
instead
or
if
you
really
want
to
be
blown
away
try
bear
republic
red
rocket
ale
drinkability
is
average
it
was
a
step
above
jwds
amber
but
still
just
another
amber
smell
is
a
very
mild
and
subtle
cedarmaltiness
taste
is
smoothquite
decent
for
an
amber
but
it
is
slightly
thin
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
amber
ales
are
not
really
my
thang
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
too
id
buy
more
of
this
if
it
was
at
my
local
store
if
nothing
more
than
to
get
a
better
grasp
on
whether
or
not
i
like
it
a
lot
id
say
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
once
or
twice
bottle
courtesy
of

clearly
evident
taste
is
a
bit
onedimensional
with
some
bitter
hops
and
caramel
malt
and
a
thin
body
seems
to
be
lacking
character
to
make
it
truly
interesting
in
my
notes
i
call
this
a
perfect
pizza
beer
take
that
with
what
you
will
drinkability
is
actually
that
of
a
nice
strong
session
brew
despite
nothing
spectacular
jumping
out
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
i
cant
say
id
go
looking
for
this
beer
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
middle
of
the
road
and
forgettable
but
still
tasty

a
very
well
executed
american

is
on
the

this
is
one
i
would
certainly
like
to
keep
around
many
thanks
to
mntlover
for
bringing
this
bottle
by
firestone
double
barrel
ale
is
a
good
one
it
has
no
real
faults
and
is
as
wellconstructed
as
any
amber
ale
that
ive
had
in
a
while
i
could
definitely
make
a
session
out
of
a
few
of
these
and
im
sure
they
would
go
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
this
isnt
quite
a
head
turner
but
it
is
a
delicious
satisfying
ale
lighter
bodied
quite
drinkable
a
good
standby
that
is
available
everywhere
a
good
crossover
beer
as
well
small
offwhitetan
filmy
head
dies
fast
over
a
clear
dark
amber
beer
there
are
some
swoops
of
lacing
the
nose
has
chocolate
and
milk
its
slightly
grainsy
nice
milk
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
a
fullflavored
drakly
malty
middle
the
finish
shows
bitter
chocolate
and
some
notquitesweet
fruitiness
bitter
aftertaste
with
crackers
its
good
quite
chocolatey
a
nice
full
session
drinkability
is
ok
not
on
par
with
the
best
amber
ales
but
still
not
bad
if
you
like
malt
with
some
nice
english
like
flavors
could
be
for
you
i
started
drinking
this
beer
once
i
moved
to
santa
barbara
i
usually
buy
this
stuff
at
costco
and
it
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
and
keep
always
stocked
for
dinner
and
company
although
like
most
beers
tastes
much
better
and
fresher
on
tap
it
pours
from
the
bottle
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
little
laced
head
on
this
particular
beer
i
am
picking
up
a
little
skunkiness
but
normally
i
would
smell
some
sweetness
and
hops
the
taste
i
think
is
unique
from
the
smokiness
by
the
oak
barrel
i
love
the
heavy
mouthfeel
good
beer
i
have
drunken
many
but
i
usually
have
maybe
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
drinkability
yeah
its
drinkable
nothing
too
exciting
middle
of
the
road
moderatly
decent
take
on
a
dull
and
bland
style
this
is
a
great
mild
session
beer
interesting
yet
not
intrusive
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
beige
head
above
the
clear
burnished
copper
brew
head
fades
but
never
quite
disappears
and
lacing
is
average
to
good
aroma
is
lightly
of
grain
husks
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
taste
is
hearty
medium
malts
with
a
citrusy
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
with
the
latter
possibly
even
more
so
this
seems
quite
sessionable
and
a
nice
brew
tasted
on
tap
at
a
mexican
restaurant
in
cambria
ca
on
122804
pours
a
typical
amber
brown
with
slight
reddish
hints
with
a
large
creamy
head
much
larger
than
seen
on
many
ambers
aroma
is
roasty
malty
and
the
flavor
follows
through
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
at
the
end
not
strong
but
definetly
present
definitely
drinkable
nothing
outrageously
wonderful
but
pretty
good
i
had
a
chance
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
on
the
way
home
but
passed
not
because
i
didnt
like
it
theres
plenty
of
good
similar
amber
ales
around
pours
with
a
onefingered
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
traces
of
lace
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
cloudy
amber
color
nose
is
slightly
malty
starts
with
some
sweet
undertones
and
finishes
with
a
even
mix
of
hops
and
malt
1
79
for
a
12oz
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
with
an
almost
offwhite
head
which
subsided
quickly
leaving
a
little
lace
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
a
healthy
dose
of
fruity
esters
and
reminded
me
of
aromatic
malt
or
some
other
mildly
roasted
malt
the
initial
taste
was
sweet
with
the
hops
playing
a
minor
role
in
the
flavor
and
bitterness
the
majority
of
the
flavor
was
of
a
clean
blend
of
dry
roasted
malts
and
sweeter
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
a
citrussy
and
flowery
hop
flavor
at
the
end
i
think
this
is
a
little
too
close
to
the
pale
ale
style
for
me
while
the
brewery
calls
it
an
amber
ale
i
like
a
little
more
malt
complexity
in
my
ambers
than
this
one
can
provide
an
average
pale
ale
this
brew
makes
a
mediocre
amber
ale
and
the
folks
at
firestone
should
work
on
the
recipe
a
little
more
drinkability
the
oak
barrel
brewing
system
adds
a
nice
complexity
to
this
amber
not
as
much
as
to
overtake
the
taste
but
merely
to
compliment
it
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
englishstyle
ale
brewed
in
california
drinkability
maybe
good
for
one
or
two
a
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
definitely
not
the
best
amber
ale
on
the
market
but
quite
enjoyable
thanks
to
unclejimbo
for
this
one
boy
i
needed
a
brew
this
evening
after
work
and
lo
and
behold
this
was
sitting
in
the
fridge
nothing
extraordinary
about
its
looks
medium
to
dark
amber
not
cloudy
per
se
but
not
crystal
clear
either
about
12
inch
of
cream
colored
foam
at
the
pour
since
gone
down
aroma
seems
thick
and
syrupy
of
toasty
malts
and
quiet
hops
carbonated
mouthfeel
full
of
small
prickly
bubbles
the
mouthfeel
is
a
plus
i
appreciate
the
level
of
carbonation
tastewise
i
am
picking
up
low
malt
although
its
made
with
5
slightly
biscuity
the
beer
concentrates
on
the
end
tastefinish
which
is
fine
with
me
that
one
is
all
about
some
slight
puckery
citrus
i
cant
believe
the
carbonation
in
this
one
probably
helps
it
not
come
across
as
syrupy
would
drink
again
not
stupendous
but
i
like
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
nice
copperamber
with
an
ample
fluffy
head
that
settles
almost
into
a
creaminess
leaving
a
thin
sheet
of
lacemild
aromas
of
some
toasted
malt
and
caramel
pretty
soft
on
the
nostrils
caramel
taste
up
front
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
with
biscuity
malt
backbone
seems
to
have
a
little
minty
spice
in
the
finish
wich
is
nicea
pretty
sweet
tasting
brew
with
not
much
hop
presence
i
think
a
decent
session
style
ale
but
it
might
get
a
little
to
sweet
after
a
few
the
mouthfeel
smooth
with
a
light
crispness
at
the
start
and
had
a
smooth
short
caramel
finish
i
found
this
to
be
nicely
drinkable
and
quite
an
enjoyable
session
beer
id
drink
it
as
a
light
alternative
to
an
amber
maybe
for
a
hot
afternoon
at
the
beach
or
something
as
such
it
would
be
fine
in
any
other
context
well
bleh
this
ale
poured
a
clear
amberred
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
a
little
while
but
eventually
settled
and
left
some
lace
the
smell
was
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
light
fruity
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
was
lightly
fruity
and
malty
with
a
good
touch
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
oakiness
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
slight
astringency
the
body
was
medium
with
medium
carbonation
there
was
a
lingering
hoppiness
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
decent
amberred
ale
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
it
pours
a
nicelooking
deep
orange
with
a
fairly
thick
head
the
smell
is
mostly
summer
fruit
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
not
really
remarkable
in
any
way
its
just
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
perhaps
another
helping
of
hops
would
improve
it
a
bit
its
quite
drinkable
and
would
probably
be
a
good
choice
when
looking
to
move
friends
out
of
macros
and
into
ales
the
oak
barrel
system
isnt
overpowering
making
this
a
very
decent
and
complex
offering
with
some
interesting
subtleties
thanks
to
unlcejimbo
for
the
sample
sampled
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
golden
brown
and
makes
a
thin
white
head
lots
of
cereal
malt
character
in
the
nose
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
flavor
is
spicy
and
sharp
slightly
bitter
and
has
a
syrupysweet
malt
character
leaves
a
creamy
coating
in
the
mouth
rather
drinkable
overall
above
average
for
the
style
i
really
wish
the
typical
macro
brew
tasted
like
this
from
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
an
off
white
foamy
head
the
head
stayed
for
a
little
while
and
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
nice
roasty
smell
combined
with
a
touch
of
smoke
taste
first
of
caramel
malt
that
has
been
toasted
with
some
slight
hop
bitterness
the
end
was
slightly
smoky
and
earthy
with
a
dry
finish
seemed
a
bit
thin
and
overcarbonated
overall
not
bad
certainly
a
good
idea
i
could
have
gone
for
a
bit
more
of
an
oak
flavor
but
i
would
not
pass
this
one
up
notes
a
tasty
brew
pale
ale
amber
ale
does
it
really
matter
either
way
it
was
enjoyable
i
have
to
admit
given
that
these
arrived
in
the
wave
of
hype
surrounding
the
bachelor
i
expected
nothing
from
this
beer
and
have
avoided
buying
it
for
at
least
a
year
my
mistake
while
perhaps
not
the
advertised
english
ale
lacing
was
o
k
musty
aroma
that
was
malt
dominating
my
favorite
local
brew
the
head
is
portly
in
size
but
the
complexity
is
lost
in
the
rustic
background
overall
not
a

dont

that
you
would
from
an

it

a
true
epa
in
that
regard
on

rather
bland
no
real

modest
malts
very
lightly
hopped
one
of
the
cleanest
tasting
beers
ive
tried
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
very
thin
head
the
smell
is
pine
from
the
hops
and
then
a
bit
of
a
bread
scent
the
taste
was
very
clean
with
focus
on
the
hops
in
the
beginning
leading
to
a
lot
of
great
citrus
notes
the
finish
had
a
nice
bite
with
little
aftertaste
which
was
very
refreshing
this
is
just
a
straight
up
solid
beer
decent
body
and
good
finish
im
not
crazy
about
hops
but
this
could
use
a
tad
more
still
just
a
very
very
decent
beer
poured
a
light
copper
almost
amber
with
a
thin
head
of
light
foam
aroma
was
spicy
with
a
sweet
fruit
note
great
carbonation
helped
bring
out
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
very
well
and
finished
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
very
nice
and
refreshing
overall
as
for
an
epa
more
earthy
and
fruity
notes
would
be
good
overall
looks
better
than
it
tastes
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
cans
for
taking
to
the
golf
course
or
drinking
on
the
riding
mower
while
cutting
my
grass
more
than
good
enough
for
that
better
than
the
typical
yuengling
or
heineken
you
find
in
cans
but
i
think
id
rather
buy
six
point
in
cans
for
that
for
now
on
adam
from
tipped
mixology
o
enjoyable
unique
pale
ale
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
little
pale
ale
if
the
metallic
taste
that
is
running
loose
would
just
go
away
id
rate
it
higher
i
have
several
more
cans
and
i
wont
be
giving
them
away
however
overall
this
is
a
pale
ale
that
is
simple
yet
has
a
wide
array
of
style
appropriate
flavors
and
aromas
the
body
is
medium
but
finishes
lighter
while
the
carbonation
level
is
spot
on
middle
for
the
style
a
slight
warming
well
after
the
swallow
leads
to
a
bready
thistle
flavored
aftertaste
though
the
classic
and
understated
complexity
of
classic
british
versions
it
quite
accurately
portrays
the
shell
of
what
proper
english
pale
ale
does
so
well
just
a
glimpse
but
a
glimpse
will
do
if
you
can
find
this
beer
on
tap
i
highly
recommend
it
if
not
though
the
can
still
keeps
the
elements
in
balance
and
is
a
perfectly
good
session
beer
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
the
price
pours
a
hazy

with
a
foamy
tan

that

taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
fruit
and
some
charcoal
like
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
an
odd
charcoal
quality
that
reminds
me
of
burnt
steak
overall
solid
pale
ale
not
remarkable
but
its
not
trying
to
be
either
this
would
pair
well
with
most
food
and
is
a
perfect
choice
for
a
backyard
party
or
cookout
i
got
this
in
a
mixed
six
and
probably
wouldnt
run
out
to
get
a
whole
six
pack
unless
i
was
having
people
over
and
wanted
a
likelytoplease
craft
ale
but
id
certainly
throw
it
in
a
thematic
american
pale
ales
that
arent
wackyflavored
or
mondo
alcohol
and
are
pretty
decent
mix
nice
pale
ale
with
solid
hop
presence
has
a
real
nice
smooth
and
refreshing
taste
i
would
suggest
it
to
a
friend
i
dont
see
myself
bragging
about
it
though
not
enough
complexity
would
session
very
well
the
aftertaste
is
clean
as
well
and
it
lingers
long
and
nice
overall
a
competent
pale
and
a
refreshing
drink
this
beer
has
a
big
crisp
bite
and
a
certain
brightness
though
it
gets
a
little
too
heavy
in
the
prickle
at
times
and
could
be
somewhat
cleaner
it
certainly
is
bright
and
theres
a
layer
added
with
some
dryness
easing
in
lightly
but
smoothness
is
affected
overall
drinkability
tasty
beer
not
sure
id
want
another
one
right
away
but
i
wouldnt

having
it
again
or
having
a
full

vs
a

love
it
overall
3
5
good
beer
but
nothing
that
extraordinary
what
really
sets
it
apart
for
me
is
its
dryness
this
is
a
pervasive
dryness
that
is
felt
at
every
level
of
the
taste
while
this
beer
is
not
suited
imho
to
a
good
session
it
is
excellent
with
food
i
imagine
it
would
also
be
great
with
seafood
particularly
heavy
fried
foods
o
solid
pale
great
alternative
to
over
citrus
peeled

beers
o
just
a
quality
beer
nothing
that
blows
me
away
but
something
that
i
would
enjoy
drinking
pretty
much
any
time
overall
a
rather
tasty
apa
that
shows
some
balance
and
doesnt
eclipse
the
malt
with
hops
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
this
is
a
passable
epa
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
o
the
malt
is
balanced
by
the
hops
its
a
good
beer
i
found
it
sessionable
good
first
beer
of
evening
or
with
pub
fare
and
comfort
foods
grilled
burger
on
pretzel
roll
heirloom
tomato
grilled
peppers
garlic
asparagus
mushrooms
o
this
pale
ale
lands
toward
the
larger
end
of
todays
spectrum
the
sturdy
malt
backbone
is
balanced
well
by
a
confidently
assertive
hop
profile
its
a
good
beer
but
its
size
and
substance
make
it
more
of
a
oneanddone
type
of
brew
than
a
sessionable
option
perhaps
not
quite
as
approachable
to
the
neophyte
as
youd
want
a
flagship
beer
to
be
but
it
certainly
has
its
place
its
a
good
pairing
option
for
pub
fare
and
comfort
foods
o
just
a
soso
pale
ale
nothing
i
would
grab
again
i
put
the
drinkability
on
this
very
high
a
very
flavorful
pale
ale
that
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
solid

which
i
enjoyed
several
times
during
a
relaxing
weekend
while
on
nantucket
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
golden
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
earth
earth
hop
spicy
hop
and
subtle
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
earth
fruit
earth
hop
and
skunky
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
average
brew
out
of
the
pale
ales
that
i
had
in
this
sampler
flight
this
was
my
least
favorite
of
the
bunch
the
skunky
note
i
picked
up
on
in
this
one
really
wasnt
that
pleasant
at
all
and
really
took
me
back
at
first
as
it
warmed
this
became
a
little
more
sharp
also
the
milk
chocolate
note
on
the
nose
felt
a
little
out
of
place
as
well
i
think
this
brew
might
have
had
an
identity
crisis
if
i
am
honest
and
didnt
know
what
it
wanted
to
be
when
it
grew
up
worth
trying
but
i
doubt
i
will
be
having
it
again
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
could
use
more
hop
character
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
light
head
on
top
more
like
surface
slush
it
also
has
a
murky
and
hazy
clarity
aroma
is
also
malts
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
hops
taste
is
malts
and
sweet
at
that
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
one
made
in
the
english
tradition
ive
try
to
take
that
into
account
but
i
think
it
lacks
depth
of
flavor
and
in
fact
think
it
quite
borish
this
was
ok
this
is
a
decent
but
simple
beer
it
has
decent
balance
and
decent
drinkability
i
think
there
are
probably
better
pale
ales
out
there
so
i
probably
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
but
it
was
good
once
o
a
solid
but
unremarkable
pale
ale
overall
i
actually
rather
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
quite
sippable
and
sessionable
it
isnt
the
most
flavorful
beer
out
there
but
it
is
certainly
a
quality
beer
it
would
make
a
good
crossover
beer
for
a
bmc
drinker
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
in
color
one
of
the
darkest
pale
ales
ive
had
great
fruity
aroma
hits
your
nose
well
before
the
beer
hits
the
mouth
the
taste
is
thick
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
lingering
hop
taste
this
is
an
exceptional
pale
ale
first
sip
is
minerally
sweet
and
lightly
hopped
a
maltystyle
pale
ale
there
is
a
definite
mineralearthy
quality
to
this
brew
overall
pretty
unexciting
but
no
real
flaws
to
speak
of
probably
wouldnt
get
again
but
i
wouldnt
complain
if
it
was
the
only
thing
to
drink
at
a
party
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
here
but
i
think
this
is
quite
a
successful
representation
of
the
style
in
addition
to
that
its
a
pretty
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
in
its
own
right
good
stuff
o
decent
nothing
tremendous
but
decent
overall
an
ok
brew
but
nothing
really
all
that
special
o
not
the
greatest
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
not
bad
does
a
good
job
of
distinguishing
itself
as
a
pale
ale
opposed
to
an
ipa
or
a
cross
between
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
though
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
inchthick
cap
mild
aromas
of
english
toffee
caramel
and
yeasty
bread
very
clean
and
crisp
taste
is
similarly
clean
and
simple
with
more
mild
breadiness
sweet
caramel
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
sharp
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
another
easydrinker
from
cisco
masters
of
understated
and
sessionable
beer
m
full
bodied
as
far
as
palate
coverage
goes
but
very
sort
lived
frontloaded
great
carb
spatially
balanced
but
temporally
overeager
o
a
great
pale
ale
that
i
will
pick
up
more
often
an
easy
drinker
and
light
enough
to
be
quite
sessionable
not
a
first
choice
but
one
that
i
would
still
recommend
as
a
second
choice
to
someone
at
the
bar
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
light
body
moderate
carbonation
but
that
weird
tang
kinda
does
something
to
the
drinkability
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
but
lacking
direction
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
wish
that
it
was
know
when
it
was
bottled
so
that
i
knew
if
i
was
drinking
the
beer
fresh
or
not
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
with
some
fruity
and
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
prickliness
and
fruitiness
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
easydrinking
and
the
drinkability
is
good
its
a
solid
english
style
pale
ale
wont
blow
your
mind
but
its
a
good
drink
o
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
find
it
to
be
extremely
well
balanced
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
for
drinking
at
cookouts
i
could
easily
pair
this
beer
with
lots
of
different
foods
definitely
sessionable
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
was
balanced
all
around
yet
it
may
be
nothing
to
scream
about
its
still
good
i
would
have
this
again
o
pretty
much
ordinary
across
the
board
a
good
session
beer
o
my
experience
with
english
pale
ales
is
very
limited
in
fact
this
might
be
the
only
one
i
have
had
however
even
if
this
beer
does
in
fact
stay
true
to
this
particular
genre
of
beer
i
still
must
say
that
i
disliked
it
based
on
the
taste
alone
but
since
it
is
getting
some
high
reviews
im
going
to
give
it
a
few
points
based
on
the
fact
that
i
must
be
somewhat
ignorant
to
this
style
and
therefore
cannot
completely
accurately
rate
it
o
if
this
tasted
better
it
would
be
an
awesome
beer
didnt
mean
to
state
the
obvious
12oz
bottle
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
foamy
beige
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
aromas
are
bready
malt
caramel
and
herbal
hops
very
earthy
tastes
are
bready
earthy
herbal
caramely
peppery
rye
citric
leathery
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
smooth
creamy
finishes
bitter
and
overly
dry
overall
nice
complexity
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
herbal
characteristics
but
this
was
pretty
good
and
what
id
expect
from
the
style
a
tasty
ale
for
the
long
term
full
disclosure
after
my
first
sip
i
was
ready
to
commit
the
unthinkable
chucking
out
the
12
pack
into
the
trash
but
this
beer
grew
on
me
by
my
fourth
can
in
as
many
days
i
was
a
respectful
admirer
tastes
like
the
sun
dried
leather
tethered
to
a
harpoon
after
a
day
long
nantucket
sleigh
ride
proof
that
change
is
constant
and
that
if
you
open
your
mind
your
palate
will
follow
p
s
the
color
is
amazing
authentic
copper
with
a
bit
of
haze
not
a
bad
beer
overall
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
classic
to
style
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
however
just
a
bit
lackluster
in
this
tasting
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
trying
it
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
golden
copper
body
with
a
2
foamy
head
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
some
malts
the
taste
has
more
malt
than
hop
to
my
taste
buds
nothing
out
standing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
this
is
a
ok
beer
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
rather
small
off
white
head
smells
crisp
and
refreshing
lemony
hops
and
a
healthy
dose
of
english
malts
lends
a
nice
light
doughy
smell
flavor
is
refreshing
too
a
nice
pale
ale
for
springtime
the
english
malts
give
it
just
enough
body
but
the
hop
profile
is
the
star
here
a
little
fruity
without
being
sweet
and
crisp
without
being
at
all
bitter
excellent
with
a
grilled
veggie
burger
full
enough
body
to
stand
up
to
all
kinds
of
food
i
will
buy
this
one
again
drink
its
a
tasteful
little
pale
ale
has
a
nice
rounded
flavor
and
lends
itself
to
the
malty
english
note
which
i
expected
i
would
take
another
bottle
o
very
solid
pretty
tasty
and
not
too
pricey
a
nice
session
ale
that
wont
rip
your
taste
buds
off
but
that
still
has
a
good
crisp
taste
o
i
support
this
brewery
whenever
i
can
because
of
the
great
times
i
have
had
at
the
brewery
while
visiting
on
nantucket
this
is
a
very
respectable
flagship
beer
from
cisco
in
what
i
consider
to
be
an
underrated
style
i
think
it
is
a
bit
thicker
than
i
would
like
from
a
beer
that
claims
perfectly
suited
for
your
next
session
but
i
would
definitely
drink
a
few
the
allblue
can
stands
out
among
the
rest
and
i
appreciate
the
simple
artwork
very
well
done
from
cisco
brewers
while
not
a
session
beer
this
is
definitely
sessionable
but
at
5
6
that
doesnt
mean
go
drink
12
of
them
overall
unique
pale
ale
i
would
called
it
lighter
style
of
a
brown
ale
it
reminds
me
of
olde
burneside
ten
penny
ale
which
certainly
isnt
a
bad
thing
overall
its
a
solid
beer
nothing
groundbreaking
nothing
over
the
top
or
special
about
it
just
a
good
pale
ale
like
it
claims
to
be
dont
know
how
old
this
could
be
date
is
smudged
on
the
bottle
but
its
only
been
in
the
market
for
a
couple
months
overall
a
wellmade
english
pale
ale
nice
balance
d
great
tasting
drink
smooth
around
the
edges
and
very
enjoyable
malt
flavors
touch
of
hops
keeps
this
beer
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
no
matter
what
time
of
day
or
meal
thought
this
beer
would
suck
but
not
bad
whatsoever
my
favorite
english
style
ale
yet
to
date
could
definitely
suck
down
a
few
of
these
subtler
flavored
brews
o
this
is
an
excellent
choice
for
a
refreshing
drink
nice
must
have
soft
resiny
palate
bitterness
upfront
and
throughout
some
minerl
malt
biscuits
and
piney
citric
hops
mix
up
for
a
classic
northeastern
american
pale
ale
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
the
northeast
has
nothing
on
the
midwest
this
is
an
alright
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
id
seek
out
a
little
too
easygoing
and
lacking
in
any
assertive
malty
flavors
and
certainly
not
hoppy
ones
this
has
a
surprising
amount
of
complexity
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
reminds
me
of
bass
just
with
more
depth
its
not
as
good
as
ipswich
ale
but
im
glad
to
know
that
this
beer
is
worth
drinking
this
would
be
great
with
food
o
drinkable
pale
ale
i
like
that
it
is
local
and
in
a
can
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
either
looks
nice
slightly

a

head
with

interesting
smell
blend
of
caramel
malt
and
slight
hop
character
smells
like
an
english
yeast
strain
flavor
is
kind
of
undefined
and
all
jumbled
together
some
citrus
fruits
from
hops
yeast
is
floral
and
quite
flavorful
suitable
bitterness
complimenting
acidity
kind
of
thick
for
a
pale
and
sweet
mouthfeel
has
an
odd
twang
at
the
end
in
general
the
flavor
arrangement
pretty
muddy
im
not
in
love
with
this
beer
but
its
pretty
good
o
overall
its
an
average
ale
with
very
little
to
it
not
too
impressed
but
it
goes
well
with
my
food

if
you
are
looking
to
get
you
or
a
friend
started
with
pale
ales
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
i
do
plan
on
buying
this
again
this
would
be
a
great
boat
beer
in
the
spring
time
o
solid
pale
ale
not
as
hoppy
as
some
of
the
pale
ales
that
ive
had
recently
or
what
ive
been
used
to
but
its
very
crisp
and
quite
refreshing

to
have
a
bit
more

am

though
ill
give
the
other
brews
a
try
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
subtle

that
keeps
it
very
drinkable
could
drink
this
year
round
and
will
definitely
buy
again
maybe
i
had
a
bad
batch
or
maybe
this
just
isnt
my
type
but
i
really
did
not

this

it
does
seem

perhaps
the

tasting
just

an
english

a
very
good
beer
either
way
though
nice
beer
very

flavors
meld

backbone
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
earthy
bitter
hops
in
the
flavor
and
a
good
breadlike
malt
backbone
tue
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
good
carbonation
the
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
day
and
a
great
example
of
an
english
pale
o
this
beer
was
great
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
it
reminds
me
strangely
of
the
kids
dessert
dirt
and
worms
oreos
cool
whip
and
sour
gummy
worms
dont
sound
like
a
match
but
put
them
together
and
you
have
a
surprisingly
tasty
and
fun
dessert
cisco
took
3
taste
spectrums
i
didnt
expect
to
play
too
well
together
but
they
really
did
it
perfectly
this
beer
is
damn
good
huge
thanks
again
to
palphen
for
this
great
throw
in
poured
from
a
can
into
a
4
oz
tasting
glass
drinkability
picked
this
up
for
9
for
the
sixpack
in
portland
and
it
was
definitely
a
good
purchase
a
highly
sessionable
and
tasty
brew
and
pretty
perfect
for
this
point
in
the
summer
o
nice
english
ipa
even
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
would
keep
a
few
cans
around
for
the
change
of
pace
overall
a
decent
ale
but
i
wish
a
few
more
handfuls
of
malt
had
been
added
to
try
and
keep
the
flavors
present
throughout
subsequent
mouthfuls
o
very
drinkable
then
ice
bitterness
with
the
citrus
notes
makes
this
a
great
summertime
pale
ale
ride
the
whale
this
one
is
a
winner
o
its
a
mediocre
pale
ale
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
highlight
of
this
for
me
was
the
drinkability
just
ridiculously
nice
mouthfeel
subtle
refreshing
flavors
at
1
99
per
bottle
its
not
bad
at
all
a
solid
english
pale
ale
and
from
a
can
even
ive
had
this
from
a
22oz
bottle
before
and
i
feel
like
this
is
about
the
same
experience
although
i
remember
it
from
the
bottle
being
a
little
more
yeasty
in
that
english
way
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
a
great
beer
for
drinking
casually
throughout
the
evening
will
be
picking
this
up
again
very
good
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
d
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
great
great
great
summer
beer
this
copper
colored
english
pale
ale
has
subtle
notes
of
citrus
hops
balanced
by
breaded
malt
and
toffee
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
the
buttery
character
of
this
ale
makes
it
an
easy
session
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
o
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
nice
wellrounded
ale
would
go
great
with
seafood
i
will
buy
again
when
i
am
up
in
the
distrobution
area
o
would
absolutely
drink
again
but
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
medium
body
here
with
soft
carbonation
not
a
bad
pale
ale
good
flavors
but
the
aroma
seems
a
little
underwheming
and
deceptive
id
say
a
pretty
good
one
to
enjoy
from
the
can
when
you
want
to
just
have
a
beer
and
not
think
about
it
too
much
overall
extremely
impressed
with
this
beer
without
a
doubt
i
will
look
to
find
more
of
this
beer
and
you
should
too
a
great
little
english
style
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
but
nothing
is
overpowering
or
overwhelming
very
much
in
a
good
way
a
great
all
year
round
beer
and
fresh
smash
fruit
in
the
bottom
would
be
lovely
since
everything
is
blended
so
well
and
is
subdued
i
have
to
say
the
price
is
a
little
daunting
9
99
a
six
i
dont
live
in
nantucket
dammit
the
taste
starts
up
sweet
with
a
slight
sour
perhaps
from
an
aciduated
not
doesnt
seem
like
a
hop
sour
the
carbonation
comes
in
and
dissipates
quickly
the
end
a
hop
bitter
comes
in
and
finishes
overall
a
nice
english
pale
not
amazing
but
if
i
couldnt
get
gearys
this
would
be
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
o
i
think
this
beer
would
be
dramatically
better
if
not
so
watery
overall
a
nice
if
average
pale
ale
im
not
sure
i
had
the
freshest
of
bottles
so
the
aroma
and
taste
may
be
a
little
off
pours
a
hazy
pale
amber
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
malt
forward
with
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
some
buttery
notes
in
the
nose
as
well
bready
toffee
malt
sweetness
and
slightly
citrusy
the
butterscotch
character
is
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
moderate
carbonation
with
a
light
crisp
body
great
summer
sipper
beer
nicely
carbonated
bite
lightly
bready
solid
maltiness
that
is
never
too
sweet
and
kept
in
balance
by
a
bitterness
thats
similar
to
the
nose
light
somewhat
floral
and
earthy
at
the
same
time
its
very
crisp
and
clean
obviously
quite
drinkable
again
really
english
inspired
ales
coming
out
of
new
england
pours
a
deep
slightly
hazed
copper
hue
with
a
bright
thicket
of
light
khaki
foam
arising
with
large
bubbles
aroma
is
floral
and
earthy
more
so
than
aggressive
and
citric
this
is
really
nice
a
fruityearthy
subtle
experience
versus
the
average
american
pale
that
borders
as
an
ipa
nice
breadiness
from
the
yeast
and
malts
utilized
here
definitely
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
in
number
wouldnt
mind
the
12
pack
of
cans
for
tailgating
im
sure
this
one
is
meant
to
be
consumed
fresh
still
has
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
but
its
completely
different
kind
of
hop
flavor
more
earthyfloral
notes
coming
out
rather
than
the
high
alpha
acid
hops
that
our
beers
typically
are
brewed
with
theres
almost
a
layer
of
brine
that
brings
the
sweet
malts
floralfruity
notes
all
together
along
with
the
thick
crusted
artisan
bread
like
notes
that
i
get
with
each
sip
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
what
a
great
drinking
session
ale
it
really
packs
in
the
flavor
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
after
seeing
it
in
ba
mag
ads
for
the
past
few
years
its
about
time
i
scored
a
few
bottles
i
paid
high
end
pricing
on
this
but
it
was
well
worth
it
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
this
beer
decent
flavor
full
but
not
too
challenging
i
usually
like
to
sample
several
different
beers
but
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
move
beyond
the
initial
heavy
focus
on
smell
flavor
mouthfee
etc
from
the
first
one
to
a
realize
it
as
a
pretty
simple
yet
tasty
brew
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
definitely
would
fit
the
bill
as
a
slightlyelevated
abv
sessiontype
beer
pretty
average
pale
but
overall
very
wellbalanced
and
dangerously
drinkable
drinkable
yep
pours
a
nice
creamy
one
and
a
half
finger
head
very
nice
retention
a
big
ring
and
a
few
big
bubbles
with
a
slight
cap
hazy
golden
color
smells
is
quite
different
that
the
usual
pale
ale
very
bready
some
woody
quality
carmel
toffee
tastes
carmel
sweet
some
toffee
carmelized
almost
burnt
sugar
flavor
quite
different
in
the
finish
bready
yeasty
doughy
im
not
sure
if
i
like
this
but
it
not
the
usual
earthy
bitter
pale
medium
bodied
medium
carbing
it
leaves
a
slick
oily
finish
i
could
drink
only
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
night
1
80
a
single
d
very
easy
to
drink
if
the
alternative
is
a
ml
or
the
like
but
definitely
not
preferred
pours
a
nice
clear
orangy
brown
color
big
poof
of
slightly
off
white
head
decent
lacing
scent
is
of
freshly
dried
malt
lightly
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
toast
and
roasted
nuts
grassy
hops
and
a
his
of
citrus
taste
is
aggressively
malt
forward
with
grassy
hops
playing
more
of
abackground
note
more
akin
to
a
bitter
than
english
pale
medium
bodied
good
moderate
carbonation
a
nicely
done
english
style
beer
with
a
good
malt
profile
decent
drinkability
for
a
full
bodied
beer
would
drink
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
good
for
a
session
if
you
like
rogues
dead
guy
ale
youll
like
this
well
balanced
medium
body
next
to
a
descent
hop
combination
i
could
see
having
a
34of
these
over
the
course
of
a
bruins
game
pours
amber
with
a
nice
head
has
a
hoppy
and
fruity
aroma
but
you
can
definitely
notice
the
malty
backbone
on
this
one
almost
bread
like
the
beer
has
a
great
balance
and
is
really
drinkable
probably
also
helped
by
the
fact
that
they
were
in
cans
really
tasty
pick
some
up
whales
tale
is
plenty
easy
to
drink
i
get
the
impression
this
would
shine
on
tap
id
certainly
be
more
inclined
to
so
drink
it
worth
a
shot
overall
what
was
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
interesting
malt
inclusions
and
the
beers
simplicity
the
nice
balance
and
easy
flavor
pairings
make
this
a
nice
selection
for
a
relaxing
sipping
brew
if
anything
it
would
have
been
nice
to
see
a
more
robust
hop
character
at
play
with
the
heavy
malts
cheers
i
find
this
be
to
have
average
drinkability
it
is
tasty
and
goes
down
well
but
it
unexceptional
it
is
above
average
though
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
but
since
it
isnt
distributed
here
in
maine
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
another
bottle
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
its
throwing
off
this
macro
adjunct
vibe
that
i
just
dont
dig
i
have
heard
good
reviews
of
this
beer
on
tap
so
ill
have
to
try
that
sometime
soon
ordered
at
joes
in
boston
on
tap
came
in
a
pint
had
a
nice
orange
with
a
thin
yeasty
head
subtle
hops
on
the
nose
a
bit
watery
in
the
nose
even
very
earthy
on
the
tongue
reminds
me
new
belgium
almost
a
bit
too
grassy
extremely
earthy
mouth
is
somewhat
watery
but
has
a
bift
of
a
kick
good
session
for
the
fans
of
earthy
not
my
style
d
this
beer
could
be
a
good
deal
better
than
it
ended
up
being
some
carbonation
along
with
some
hop
aroma
would
really
improve
this
brew
easy
enough
to
drink
and
one
could
justify
having
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
winding
down
very
nice
fresh
crisp
and
relaxing
great
drinkability
after
a
long
day
of
whaling
its
nice
to
settle
down
with
ishmael
and
have
one
of
these
however
its
still
not
quite
something
that
would
drag
ahab
from
brewery
to
brewery
in
search
of
his
great
white
pale
ale
drinkability
is
good
i
feel
bad
that
i
got
this
in
the
fall
otherwise
this
would
have
easily
been
my
summer
pick
for
a
pale
easy
to
drink
a
few
in
a
row
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
dense
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
this
is
especially
gorgeous
the
nose
has
a
nice
herbal
and
minty
hop
character
specifically
this
almost
has
a
little
peppermint
oil
as
it
warms
a
pleasant
malt
character
appears
the
marris
otter
and
mild
sweetness
the
mo
character
is
actually
really
low
the
palate
opens
herbal
and
light
citrus
along
with
some
light
sugar
and
caramel
sweetness
the
malt
base
isnt
particularly
complex
here
this
doesnt
has
the
depth
id
expect
from
a
moforward
beer
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
providing
a
crisp
finish
theres
a
light
bitterness
along
with
some
light
hop
flavor
with
citrus
and
light
herbal
character
decent
stuff
overall
impression
pretty
decent
english
pale
ale
quite
forgettable
as
an
apa
nothing
outstanding
here
but
a
very
good
session
ale
d
definitely
worth
repeated
visits
domestic
english
pale
that
captures
the
style
hell
yeah
ive
been
looking
for
something
like
this
for
long
time
price
is
right
relatively
cheaper
cheers
delicious
copper
honey
colored
ale
sweet
candy
aroma
and
taste
pours
with
a
half
inch
head
that
quickly
settles
seems
too
sweet
to
be
an
english
pale
ale
but
i
still
think
this
is
a
fantastic
and
thirst
quenching
beer
gets
better
as
it
rests
too
this
was
interesting
this
tasted
english
but
had
a
boldness
to
the
flavors
that
reminded
me
much
more
of
american
take
on
the
pale
ale
style
the
deep
earth
and
tanginess
of
the
profile
hindered
the
drinkibility
a
bit
for
me
but
this
was
still
pretty
solid
overall
bonus
points
for
the
portability
of
the
container
its
good
to
see
cisco
getting
on
board
with
this
a
selection
that
arrived
from
the
botmc
lets
give
it
a
whirl
this
brew
has
a
great
bottle
smell
of
red
licorice
and
malt
pours
to
a
cloudy
bronze
amber
color
with
a
creamy
multisize
bubble
head
that
laces
nicely
on
receding
taste
of
this
brew
continues
the
licorice
flavor
nice
hopping
with
a
bite
expected
for
a
pale
ale
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
with
notes
of
licorice
and
butterscotch
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
for
a
pale
ale
not
really
on
the
mark
but
a
very
tasty
brew
not
really
a
sessioner
with
the
sweetness
but
would
pair
great
with
a
salmon
or
tuna
had
this
in
a
cute
blue
can
didnt
pour
it
because
i
enjoy
drinking
craft
beer
out
of
cans
just
that
much
it
has
a
relatively
weak
but
pleasant
nosetoasty
with
citrus
hopsand
tastes
like
that
too
but
very
bright
and
effervescent
with
really
nice
grapefruit
citrus
tangerine
against
a
sweet
biscuit
malt
all
pale
ales
should
be
this
wellhopped
carbonation
is
also
perfect
and
i
would
love
to
reach
for
this
one
on
a
hot
summers
day
dwouldnt
want
more
than
two
or
three
but
worth
a
try
medium
bodied
brew
well
balanced
between
sweet
malts
and
fresh
hop
flavors
if
this
brew
had
a
malt
to
hop
meter
it
would
be
directly
in
the
middle
easy
going
in
and
easy
going
down
good
sessions
brew
pick
up
a
6er
while
you
can
overall
it
seems
like
the
only
time
i
rave
about
pale
ales
is
when
they
creep
in
to
ipa
territory
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
more
pedestrian
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
because
yeah
i
like
it
but
its
kind
of
like
that
plain
girl
next
door
with
the
great
personality
that
you
would
date
but
who
you
wouldnt
exactly
go
bragging
to
your
friends
about
this
beers
appearance
was
a
copperamber
color
poured
with
no
lace
the
aroma
was
mainly
plums
with
butterscotch
brandy
notes
flavor
began
as
plums
moving
to
vanilla
warm
raisin
pie
whales
tale
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
smooth
over
the
entire
palate
low
drinkability
due
to
being
filling
its
alcohol
warmth
try
it
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
easy
drinking
nice
refreshing
beer
but
its
pretty
fruity
in
the
midpalate
overall
its
decent
id
have
it
again
if
offered
to
me
but
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
d
not
a
bad
little
apa
but
nothing
over
the
top
super
not
a
big
session
beer
just
a
few
will
do
you
just
be
ready
this
one
is
a
little
more
on
the
malty
side
taste
leans
toward
the
malts
and
is
both
sweet
caramel
and
burning
toffee
a
light
to
moderate
bitterness
finishes
it
off
and
is
accentuated
by
some
toast
this
could
easily
be
confused
for
an
amber
ale
as
hopping
overall
is
pretty
light
keeps
is
clean
and
simple
not
a
bad
brew
i
have
had
a
couple
tasty
offerings
from
cisco
now
thanks
to
shawn
for
sharing
d
a
decent
apa
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
would
try
again
sometime
d
a
fresh
flavorful
and
fun
beer
i
was
surprised
and
impressed
with
this
one
this
is
a
short
and
simple
review
for
a
simple
beer
not
a
ton
of
flavor
or
aroma
and
not
a
ton
of
depth
but
overall
its
a
decent
enough
drink
great
for
a
light
nightcap
or
a
refreshing
summer
beer
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
or
trade
for
but
certainly
something
i
would
order
on
a
sunny
day
in
a
beer
garden
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can

a
caramel
color

inch
head
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
taste
is
predominatly
of
hops
some
malts
finishes
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
d
very
good
could
easily
throw
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
feel
aok
about
it
love
the
cans
fruits
shine
through
this
american
pale
ale
hints
of
orange
and
cherry
are
the
main
flavors
mild
sweet
taste
to
the
beer
finishes
with
a
little
hop
and
some
dryness
a
little
watery
as
well
creates
a
light
mouthfeel
not
a
big
flavored
apa
by
any
means
i
like
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
consider
it
a
pale
ale
due
to
the
fact
that
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
lighter
beer
but
still
a
solid
beer
good
for
summer
could
be
easily
paired
with
fish
and
would
taste
excellent
overall
very
nice
session
beer
from
cisco
well
done
i
will
add
this
to
the
lineup
especially
in
cans
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
goes
down
well
it
is
well
carbonated
but
not
too
heavy
and
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
better
than
i
expected
for
a
pale
ale
very
straitforward
and
totally
refreshing
not
a
must
have
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
love
a
d
what
a
wonderful
beer
cisco
made
sure
their
flagship
this
is
their
flaghship
right
is
one
to
talk
about
because
of
this
beers
dryness
it
lacks
a
creamy
texture
i
have
appreciated
in
other
beers
but
is
still
very
smooth
with
a
little
of
that
hops
bite
at
the
finish
my
impression
is
that
many
people
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
beer
but
few
would
be
blown
away
by
it
two
fingers
worth
of
tawny
head
immediately
appeared
on
the
pour
bubbling
and
frothing
like
the
weird
sisters
brew
in
macbeth
the
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
very
orangish
zesty
in
its
scope
and
intensity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
sweettart
combination
on
the
tongue
like
a
fizzy
candy
orange
and
caramel
if
you
can
imagine
such
a
thing
wild
finish
was
still
lingering
with
that
same
sweettart
flavor
causing
a
niggling
feeling
that
i
have
tasted
something
like
this
before
but
i
cannot
dredge
it
up
this
is
definitely
going
into
the
cooler
this
summer
mediumbodied
not
sure
whats
up
with
the
carbonation
here
its
very
aggressive
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
like
pop
rocks
or
something
wasnt
expecting
that
kind
of
thin
this
just
isnt
a
good
beer
not
enjoyable
at
all
and
the
first
drainpour
ive
had
in
a
while
notes
certainly
not
a
bad
pale
ale
cheers
would
i
buy
more
of
it
you
bet
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
in
a
can
and
tremendously
sessionable
so
its
downright
perfect
for
an
afternoon
on
a
boat
or
in
your
own
backyard
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
overall
taste
doesnt
stand
out
as
being
very
interesting
where
i
would
want
to
drink
this
on
its
own
although
it
would
likely
make
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
meal
d
a
wonderful
drinkability
much
appreciated
before
and
throughout
a
pairing
with
raw
oysters
and
broiled

bass
delicious
amber
in
the

with
a
hint
of
hazy

keeps
a
nice
white
head
to
the
bottom
taste
is
malt
with
subtle
hops
and
very
fresh
flavors
this
is
one
i
go
out
of
my
way
for
esp
if
you
can
find
bombers
smaller
bottles
seem
to
be
a
bit
less
flavorful
and
lighter
bodied
weird
but
true
also
not
cheap
at
78
bucks
a
four
pack
d
excellent
crisp
slightly
bitter
pale
ale
that
lends
itself
to
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
the
taste
leaves
me
wanting
another
even
when
another
beer
is
calling
my
name
beloved
this
beer
was
copper
colored
with
a
mediumsized
tan
head
there
was
a
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
fruity
sweet
malt
aroma
a
fruity
taste
mostly
orange
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
the
tiniest
bit
of
hops
that
came
in
late
a
nice
middleofthe
road
apa
definitely
an
easy
drinker
and
it
was
great
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
that
i
1
had
to
wait
for
a
table
and
2
did
not
expect
any
good
beers
to
be
on
tap
d
great
tasting
overall
light
sweeter
taste
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
anything
from
cisco
brewers
and
it
wont
be
my
last

you
might
get
in
over
your

with
this
one
as
no
real
alcohol
flavors
are
noted
pretty
decent
and
certainly
a
wellbalanced
apa
serving
type
bottle
not
as
bold
as
most
apas
ive
had
i
still
think
smuttynose
shoals
pale
is
the
apa
to
beat
but
fantastic
balance
and
an
english
creaminess
to
the
pale
that
allow
it
to
be
both
refreshing
and
subtly
sweet
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
bottled
and
i
like
it
a
lot
but
i
prefer
it
on
tap
its
my
weekly
goto
on
wednesday
nights
at
the
local
in
west
newton
where
inexplicably
and
admirably
this
and
ommegang
hennepin
on
tap
are
each
a
buck
less
than
guinness
drinkability
this
is
an
above
average
pale
ale
i
like
the
balck
tea
taste
i
think
i
could
have
three
but
not
a
six
a
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
pale
ale
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
a
little
too
belgiany
to
be
called
an
american
pale
ale
it
really
tastes
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
an
american
pale
ale
its
very
good
but
a
little
more
intense
than
the
positioning
might
make
you
believe
d
pretty
high
this
is
actually
quite
enjoyable
despite
being
only
lightly
hopped
and
not
very
complex
not
a
bad
session
beer
all
in
all
a
very
nice
representative
of
the
style
good
job
cisco
if
i
can
find
this
locally
i
would
certainly
pick
it
up

was
spot
on
for
a
good

not
too
hoppy
but
with
enough
hops
to
keep
your
palate
awake
mouthfeel
was
a
nice
combo
a
hops
and
some
maltiness
to
act
as
a
counterbalance
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
beer
listed
as
a
6
8
abv
as
i
found
it
very
drinkable
i
love
to
see
that
american
brewers
can
pull
off
a
great
pale
ale
and
cisco
has
done
just
that
got
the
18oz
bottle
since
i
like
pale
ale
and
liked
the
art
work
on
it
a
nice
thick
tan
head
floats
atop
a
hazy
amber
pint
when
i
think
of
pale
ale
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
to
see
in
my
glass
beautiful
the
nose
is
extremely
yeasty
with
some
applelike
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
as
the
smell
suggests
lots
of
yeasty
fresh
bread
notes
and
a
nice
fruitiness
the
finish
is
fairly
long
with
some
dry
woody
flavors
and
a
nice
little
fleeting
dose
of
hop
bitterness
well
crafted
tasty
easy
drinking
and
nicely
balanced
couple
this
beer
pours

a
buttery
hint
with
a
touch
of

a
nice
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
bit
flavor
starts
with
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
accentuated
by
uppity
carbonation
as
the
beer
mellows
a
bit
some
toasted
toffee
malts
pull
through
but
theres
an
offnote
that
reminds
me
of
tart
fruitsnot
exactly
fitting
for
the
style
a
bit
of
spiced
wood
finishes
with
a
dry
bitterness
of
raw
hop
leaves
this
beer
could
use
a
boost
in
the
malts
department
if
only
to
make
the
body
a
bit
fuller
and
not
so
dry
on
the
finish
feels
like
its
sucking
the
moisture
out
of
my
tongue
with
each
sip
the
carbonation
could
also
stand
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
especially
for
a
style
that
should
go
down
easily
and
refresh
the
palate
sweet
and
heavy
predominantly
honey
with
some
bready

it
was

it

good

the

there
is

the

is
excellent
with

rarely
encountered
in

the

is

not

it
was
nice
to
see
this
available
at
the
new
southern
joint
down
the
street
tupelo
i
had
forgotten
nearly
about
these
guys
i
am
a
fan
of
the
artwork
design
so
this
added
to
my
anticipation
as
i
poured
the
bright

a
decent
head
for
a
pale
ale
about
1
finger
of
creamy
white
head
sat
for
a
bit
before
dissolving
down
but
leaving
a
nice
stick
white
lace
throughout
the
aroma
lacked
the
pungent
hop
inyourface
that
many
have
likely
since
this
ale
balances
malt
hop
nicely
floral
hops
meet
grainy
malt
met
the
nose
palate
the
sharp
crisp
mediumbody
nature
makes
this
a
nice
overall
summer
beer
clean
bright
balanced
overall
great
drinkability
the
flavors
all
play
well
together
nothing
is
overpowering
not
many
complex
flavors
but
what
is
there
is
very
enjoyable
i
really
wish
this
was
available
in
my
area
d
i
somewhat
enjoyed
this
brew
but
seeing
as
how
the
only
beer
store
that
i
know
has
it
is
about
25
minutes
from
me
i
dont
think
ill
be
making
any
special
trips
drinkability
probably
not
a
session
beer
i
feel
like
itd
sit
heavy
and
make
me
burp
a
lot
carbonation
was
great
and
despite
not
liking
the
main
taste
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
if
i
had
liked
the
tones
of
this
beer
i
would
have
definitely
been
able
to
put
down
a
few
more
love
this
pale
ale
hops
are
kept
in
check
and
impart
lots
of
great
flavor
leading
to
a
delicious
experience
d
a
well
made
pale
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
has
a
good
balanced
taste
that
makes
it
easy
to
want
multiple
servings
worth
trying
sometime
final
thoughts
complex
interesting
flavor
from
a
pale
ale
makes
this
one
worth
at
least
trying
definitely
a
usual
for
me
at
one
of
the
local
pubs
definitely
one
i
could
drink
multiples
of
because
of
its
light
body
and
fairly
plain
taste

was

with

well

some

a

and
bit
of
astringency
generally
inoffensive
and
well
balanced
but
not
quite
smooth
as
id
like
thanks
donkeyrunner
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
recommended
as
a
session
beer
particularly
if
you
want
to
get
lost
in
other
stuff
and
rather
blissfully
keep
on
sipping
without
exerting
much
sensory
energy
more
going
on
than
the
north
coast
red
seal
but
not
as
much
fun
as
dales
pale
ale
id
drink
it
on
draught
when
i
see
it
though
hv
the
beer
is
a
decent
beer
the
color
is
a
clear
amber
the
smell
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
not
over
powering
either
just
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
malt
little
to
no
carbonation
gives
this
beer
a
mellow
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
but
its
not
very
memorable
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
not
a
lot
right
with
it
either
nice
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
lacing
almost
honey
colored
smells
sweet
but
pretty
well
balanced
it
has
an
interesting
flavor
it
didnt
match
what
i
was
expecting
theres
a
decent
hops
aftertaste
thats
not
overwhelming
like
an
ipa
i
cant
think
of
any
complex
pale
ales
but
this
one
is
more
interesting
than
the
usual
mix
id
prefer
something
with
more
body
but
id
put
this
on
tap
at
home
in
the
spring
or
summer
good
beer
id
recommend
buying
some
d
okay
but
nothing
that
would
stand
out
overall
i
thought
this
was
outstanding
my
first
taste
of
cisco
and
i
was
very
impressed
it
was
light
well
balanced
and
very
nicely
hopped
i
would
have
no
issue
with
making
this
one
a
regular
session
ale
any
day
of
the
week
d
this
is
a
wholly
uninteresting
beer
lacking
character
it
never
grabbed
hold
of
me
and
the
taste
was
simply
too
thin
drinkability
a
bit
weak
i
must
admit
pours
a
slightly
hazed
deep
orange
coppery
highlights
nice
big
fluffy
tan
head
fades
slow
and
hangs
around
for

carbonated
with
a
slight

to
the
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
one
of
my
favorites
poured
into
a
sad
little
cup
at
the
gazebo
on
nantucket
this
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
nice
offwhite
foam
and
good
lace
smells
of
mellow
citrus
hops
and
biscuit
fresh
and
crisp
it
has
an
energetic
carbonation
with
orange
and
banana
highlights
in
a
bready
mix
highly
refreshing
endlessly
drinkable
a
full
feel
without
loosing
the
light
refreshing
quality
the
tart
edges
come
out
more
as
you
go
with
some
peppery
touches
from
a
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
small
quickly
receding
head
smells
of
piney
hops
dominate
first
sip
is
light
but
refreshing
with
a
nice
hop
taste
balanced
with
the
not
too
malty
ale
slighty
under
carbonated
but
still
pretty
tasty
i
would
consider
this
more
in
line
with
an
english
pale
ale
instead
of
an
apa
a
good
beer
none
the
less
nice
amber
a
head
that
sticks
round
and
loves
me
long
time

r
lovely

very
drinkable
and
seemingly

as

it
doesnt

on
either

from

i

very

good
session
beer
pours
a
cloudy
coppery
brew
with
little
offwhite
head
a
very
floral
aroma
from
this
particular
beer
backed
by
the
smell
of
hops
tastes
much
the
same
as
it
smells
too
flowery
and
sweet
and
not
bitter
enough
for
either
an
apa
as
it
is
listed
here
or
an
ipa
as
it
was
listed
at
the
bar
this
taste
vanishes
quickly
and
leaves
you
with
a
slight
malt
and
slightly
lemon
like
taste
i
couldnt
even
drink
one
drinkability
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
drinking
multiple
is
the
price
drinkability
is
very
good
because
of
lack
of
hops
but
not
good
because
this
beer
is
way
too
boring
to
have
more
than
one
overall
a
rather
tasty
apa
that
shows
some
balance
and
doesnt
eclipse
the
malt
with
hops
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
poured
with
minimal
head
but
good
barley
smell
impressed
with
drinkability
and
consistancy
of
flavor
as
temperature
changed
but
it
lacked
the
hop
flavor
of
a
pale
ale
4pack
was
quite
pricey
and
would
not
buy
again
at
that
price11

i

it
is

craved
more

after
this

being
a

in
the

interestingly
brewed

with

an
amazing

lots
of

the

now
a
hazy
copper
color
in
the

with
a
light
offwhite
head
a
biscuity
malt
aroma
with
slight
hoppy
undertones
and
also
some
sweetness
not
much
hops
just
enough
to
balance
fruit
sweetness
from
the
malt
pear
and
caramel
in
the
center
finishing
with
a
quick
bitterness
smooth
and
drinkable
even
a
cantankerous
old
peglegged
tar
would
agree
this
was
on
tap
at
moan
and
dove
the
colors
were
of
a
dark
reddishamber
with
a
thin
head
the
aromas
were
also
thin
with
malty
spices
permeating
from
the
drink
the
taste
was
decently
bitter
but
with
a
subtle
punch
to
it
this
made
it
an
approachable
apa
but
also
a
bit
lacking
in
distinctness
an
almost
frothy
carbonation
was
the
structure
of
this
mediumbody
drink
overall
a
bit
average
american
pale

review
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
and
it
was
really
good
i
remember
a
nice
malty
smell
great
malty
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
british
style
pale
not
a
lot
of
hoppy
taste
or
smell
for
me
though
not
sure
about
the
head
because
the
bartender
poured
off
the
foam
this
is
an
impressive
looking
beer
the
flavor
is
decent
with
a
good
mouthfeel
not
all
that
complex
but
simple
and
very
drinkable
for
apa
fans
although
moreso
when
cold
than
when
it
warms
a
solid
ipa
all
around
hazy
copper
color
with
a
thin

sheets
of

that
fall

up

challenges
any
micro
brewed
amrican
beers
which
have
taken
over

over

i
recomend
this
beer
as
a
compliment
to
the
fineset
meal
at
your
favorite
restaurant
or
a
session
beer
on
sunday
as
you
wade
through
the
nfl
results
to
the
wee
hours
of
the
night
best
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
very
refreshing
with
a
very
unique
taste
difficult
to
compare
because
it
sets
its
own
path
this
is
what
beer
is
all
about
try
it
once
and
you
will
be
hooked
the
boys
on
nantucket
kill
with
this
one
you
wont
be
dissappointed
with
moor
porter
as
my
favorite
they
have
really
shown
they
know
what
brewing
is
all
about
pours
a
hazy

color
with

aromas
of

and

in
the
taste
grapefruity
hops
and
a
mellow

mouthfeel
fo

but
not
too
filling
and
a
clean
aftertaste
a
very
nice
pale

and
a
clean
end
finish
my
wife
and
i
went
to
a
new
restaurant
burtons
bar
grill
in
a
newer
shopping
complex
in
ct
this
beer
was
on
special
for
the
evening
like
the
other
reveiwers
it
took
me
by
surprise
the
color
of
the
beer
for
a
pale
ale
when
i
choose
a
beer
i
try
to
pair
it
with
the
food
i
have
chosen
if
i
can
depending
on
the
beer
selection
which
was
very
good
here
this
was
a
very
refreshinggreat
mouthfeel
and
very
good
after
taste
especially
paired
with
a
panani
type
sandwich
and
a
chilled
cucumber
salad
i
have
had
other
cisco
beers
in
the
past
but
this
one
tops
them
all
i
had
a
12oz
bottle
with
raw
oysters
at
the
grand
central
oyster
bar
in
nyc
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
just
a
standard
pale
ale
i
guess
but
this
surprised
me
by
every
metric
first
off
its
a
lot
darker
than
youd
think
dark
copper
colored
apa
the
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
but
very
rich
with
malt
very
original
in
its
way
kind
of
like
orval
is
original
but
not
with
similar
flavors
to
orval
the
flavor
was
malty
sweet
and
a
little
citrucy
on
the
back
end
with
nice
carbonation
throughout
very
easily
paired
with
raw
seafood
nice
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
enjoyable
and
wellrounded
pale
ale
that
would
go
perfectly
with
a
variety
of
dishes
what
a
surprise
this
beer
was
it
pours
a
nice
thick
frothy
head
with
substantial
lacing
it
is
a
nice
amber
color
and
the
smell
is
hoppy
floral
and
not
overpowering
very
enticing
smell
color
pour
and
head
the
taste
is
very
nice
you
will
find
a
well
balanced
slightly
hoppy
creamy
moderately
carbonated
ale
that
has
a
biscuity
or
bready
taste
to
it
it
is
medium
bodied
and
for
a
beer
with
a
6
8
abv
you
wont
notice
the
alcohol
i
dont
detect
much
in
the
way
of
floral
overtones
but
you
can
taste
some
of
the
hoppy
esters
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
this
is
a
pure
vanilla
cream
on
the
tongue
and
very
satisfying
the
only
negative
is
a
overly
hoppy
aftertaste
that
becomes
a
bit
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
is
a
very
good
offering
and
a
nice
surprise
i
didnt
suspect
buying
it
cold
off
the
shelf
lchaim
this
beer
comes
in
a
kick
ass
26
oz
bottle
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
had
two
with
a
nice
meal
in
brookline
ma
d
somewhat
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
but
has
a
lot
of
epa
influence
as
well
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
its
not
the
first
that
i
would
choose
even
within
the
style
this
one
was
not
bad
overall
and
was
certainly
one
of
the
more
unique
pale
ales
that
ive
sampled
didnt
love
it
but
was
far
from
hating
it
a
decent
brew
that
could
be
tinkered
with
to
up
its
drinkability
but
i
have
to
give
it
credit
for
doing
its
own
thing
overall
8
for
a
4
pack
and
definitely
worth
it
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
good
apa
and
i
particulary
like
how
neither
the
hops
nor
the
malt
dominates
the
flavour
i
recommend
it
there
may
well
be
times
when
taking
apart
a
beer
for
its
elements
loses
sight
of
how
good
it
works
in
the
aggragate
this
is
just
a
solid
beer
ill
leave
it
at
that
thanks
to
cburian
for
including
this
as
part
of
my
secret
bunny
07
package
a
wonderful
brew
categorized
here
as
an
apa
claims
on
label
to
be
an
englishstyle
pale
ale
truth
is
probably
somewhere
in
between
an
american
pale
ale
with
definate
english
influence
easy
to
drink
i
was
very
surprised
to
learn
of
abv
level
alcohol
very
well
covered
with
a
lasting
fruity
flavor
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
ever
had
its
not
a
style
i
would
drink
all
the
time
very
nice
to
have
one
once
and
a
while
i
would
love
to
find
this
on
draft
highly
recommended
d
i
guess
its
decent
pale
ale
just
not
what
i
like
im
sure
if
i
were
at
a
bar
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
its
not
something
id
be
seeking
out
poured
a
hazy
orange
brown
hue
from
a
12
oz
bottle
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
light
lace
left
behind
in
the
pint
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
certainly
has
a
nice
rolling
mix
of
hops
and
caramel
malts
in
the
aroma
mild
hints
of
the
hops
are
present
in
the
back
of
the
nose
nice
flavor
in
the
mouth
smooth
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
balance
of
hop
tones
on
the
tongue
hints
of
fruit
and
caramel
tones
are
present
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
brew
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
good
drinkability
and
a
good
pale
ale
that
i
wish
i
had
tried
sooner
im
going
to
try
and
make
this
a
staple
well
my
huge
bottle
didnt
have
the
cool
painted
label
wish
it
did
anyway
this
poured
with
a
copper
color
and
thin
but
lacing
head
the
citric
aroma
tended
more
to
the
grassy
or
dull
grapefruit
side
than
the
flowery
fruitiness
of
other
american
pale
ales
musty
and
almost
sour
this
beer
draws
from
a
lessglorified
family
tree
than
the
pale
ales
that
have
become
most
prominetn
this
stays
down
the
lane
dominated
more
by
earthen
flavors
than

i
favor
beers
in

vein
but
you
have
to
be
prepared
this
would
be
awesome
with
a
nice
fish
and
chips

d
not
a
great
tasting
american
pale
ale
but
drinkable
a
nice
simple
british
styleamericanized
pale
ale
had
this
on
tap
at
the
rose
and
crown
pub
in
nantucket
last
night
the
first
round
had
a
very
slick
mouthfeel
that
was
accentuated
by
the
low
carbonation
with
a
dominant
malty
character
upon
the
second
round
pour
the
keg
emptied
and
a
fresh
one
was
tapped
the
new
keg
was
much
better
carbonation
was
improved
and
the
hops
came
out
to
better
balance
the
brew
inviting
cloudy
amber
color
and
very
drinkable
i
consumed
4
before
i
had
to
get
back
on
the
boat
paired
nicely
with
a
mussel
appetizer
and
breadsticks
multiple
growlers
purchased
at
the
brewery
on
nantucket
this
beer
has
a
very
soft
and
subtle
malt
flavor
with
more
floral
than
bittering
hops
and
a
hint
of
banana
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
luscious
and
creamy
have
had
this
beer
ontap
at
many
locations
including
the
brewery
and
have
also
enjoyed
it
in
the
12
and
22oz
bottles
my
advice
is
to
seek
this
beer
as
fresh
as
you
can
get
it
and
you
will
never
tire
from
the
delicate
flavor
and
creamy
mouthfeel
older
samples
do
not
compare
really
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
it
later
this
coming
weekend
very
biscuity
due
to
yeast
with
a
sour
taste
of
grapefruits
this
one
underwhelms
mouthfeel
is
way
off
as
there
is
so
much
carbonation
that
the
beer
keeps
expanding
in
your
mouth
leading
to
a
rather
unpleasant
experience
although
the
presentation
is
a
bit
odd
from
the
color
and
haze
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
id
be
pleased
to
have
another
pint
in
a
real
glass
this
time
please
i
had
this
on
tap
at
bayzos
pub
at
ocean
edge
resort
in
brewster
a
swanky
place
that
you
end
up
paying
for
and
at
7
50
a
pint
i
didnt
have
too
many
but
its
dam
good
overall
a
nice
apa
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
understated
example
of
the
style
though
this
is
a
quality
pale
ale
it
does
not
stand
out
as
anything
special
poured
a
slight
hazed
burnt
orange
with
some
chunks
and
floaties
swirling
about
with
a
creamylike
slight
offwhite
head
fruity
estures
in
the
aroma
along
with
some
caramelbiscuit
malt
with
a
lighter
herbal
note
very
english
hop
profile
quite
fruity
and
herbal
in
its
character
with
a
big
caramel
base
with
that
herbal
note
in
the
finish
well
if
you
like
english
style
pales
this
is
your
thingfor
me
its
quaffable
but
not
my
stylesaying
that
its
a
decent
beer
to
be
had
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
but
is
very
characteristic
of
the
genre
nothing
overbearing
smooth
and
clean
i
could
dig
downing
this
at
the
beach
i
guess
brewers
from
nantucket
wouldnt
have
it
any
other
way
i
guess
m
d
mouthfeel
is
very
good
on
this
offering
from
cisco
very
smooth
with
a
fresh
light
taste
but
yet
full
bodied
drinkability
is
good
on
this
beer
very
nice
tasting
offering
from
cicso
provided
you
get
it
on
the
island
on
tap
or
in
a
growler
otherwise
buyer
beware
murky
amber
color
with
a
giant
head
takes
a
while
to
settle
down
nice
thick
swashes
of
lace
remain
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
earthy
and
muddyt
a
bit
too
strong
of
an
aroma
but
the
negativity
associated
with
the
scent
doesnt
seem
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
taste
nice
smooth
well
balanced
british
style
pale
ale
maltiness
and
caramel
upfront
with
a
good
amount
of
hoppiness
to
keep
it
from
being
syruppy
seems
like
it
would
be
good
with
a
lot
of
different
types
of
food
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
cisco
whales
tale
pours
cloudy
at
first
then
clears
to
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
appetizing
head
nice
aroma
lots
of
grain
up
front
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
the
hops
come
out
in
the
taste
and
theyre
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
the
grainy
taste
of
the
malt
mirrors
the
aroma
of
the
beer
but
the
hop
flavors
are
much
more
pronounced
that
in
the
aroma
overall
though
this
beer
sits
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
with
a
slight
malt
sweetness
present
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
for
a
pale
ale
and
very
nice
with
its
great
balance
smooth
mouthfeel
and
balanced
flavor
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
all
day
or
night
makes
a
great
accompaniment
to
lots
of
food
too
this
brew
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
copperorange
color
with
a
respectable
inch
head
nice
aromacaramel
and
toasty
smells
its
got
a
pretty
earthy
smell
with
a
light
floral

quality
the
smell
is
of
moderatelow
intensity
and
the
taste
follows
the
lines
of
the
aroma
its
a
pretty
smooth
maltycaramelly
brew
with
restrained
hop
character
this
is
certainly
an
english
style
pale
ale
medium
body
tilts
to
the
sweet
side
of
things
all
in
all
this
ones
a
solid
drinkingbeer
its
nothing
extraordinary
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
respectable
homebrews
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
few
of
these
d
tasty
and
different
for
a
pale
ale
i
definitely
recommend
a
taste
it
does
improve
as
it
warms
but
so
do
lots
of
other
craft
beers
this
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
pretty
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
an
ipa
hoppiness
with
enough
malt
to
have
a
sweet
nutty
aftertaste
this
is
a
tasty
sweet
brew
that
i
could
have
again
and
again
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
from
cisco
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
there
arent
other
flavors
that
come
forward
to
add
interest
to
this
beer
its
easy
enough
to
quaff
a
pint
of
this
one
but
i
didnt
feel
any
desire
to
have
another
luckily
i
only
bought
one
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
nice
big
bright
white
head
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
floweryherbal
aroma
different
than
what
id
expect
from
a
pale
ale
but
refreshing
very
yeasty
too
full
bodied
flavor
nutty
and
bready
spicy
hops
and
a
pleasant
lingering
light
bitterness
nice
pale
ale
though
not
a
typical
pale
ale
much
more
herbal
and
bready
its
good
though
and
recommended
oh
well
this
pale
has
a
nice
creamy
yet
light
consistant
head
coloring
is
rich
soft
caramel
the
mouth
is
fruity
bitter
with
a
strong
ale
taste
going
down
this
ale
is
refreshing
with
a
noticable
hoppy
kick
but
i
would
classify
it
as
middle
of
the
road
variety
on
the
pricey
side
over
time
ive
grown
fonder
of
the
pales
but
this
was
a
dissapointment
not
bad
just
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
given
the
barmaids
spectacular
recommendation
dark
orange
with
some
reddness
no
discernable
head
but
laces
lightly
regardless
good
hops
and
sourdough
bread
on
the
nose
some
citrus
nice
complexity
and
pleasant
tone
really
bland
blah
bland
bland
some
hoppiness
yes
some
breadiness
yes
not
much
zap
to
it
though
the
feel
was
very
good
if
not
ideal
but
the
moutfeel
has
to
combine
with
the
taste
and
it
doesnt
here
drinkable
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
smooth
and
you
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
it
feels
wet
juicy
overall
quite
drinkable
not
too
heavy
and
light
enough
to
want
another
this
makes
me
want
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
brewerys
other
brewerings
drinkability
is
solid
ive
had
my
personal
issues
with
cisco
brews
but
this
one
was
pretty
solid
good
balance
for
style
and
not
over
the
top
like
some
of
their
other
beers
overall
not
even
close
to
worth
7
for
a
bottle
if
this
is
what
this
beer
always
tastes
like
out
of
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
even
buy
this
if
it
cost
7
for
a
sixer
this
beer
is
hard
to
judge
appears
a
fairly
typical
amber
color
with
an
average
head
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
pale
ale
smell
and
taste
however
are
pretty
subdued
in
my
opinion
not
enough
there
in
terms
of
hops
and
believe
me
i
like
hops
but
im
not
a
fan
of
overhopping
at
all
i
prefer
the
subtle
side
of
things
but
this
is
kind
of
bland
with
a
twinge
of
citrus
and
pine
on
the
other
hand
i
almost
would
rank
the
mouthfeel
a
5
its
almost
casklike
extremely
smooth
and
light
which
makes
for
high
drinkability
if
i
could
combine
the
texture
of
this
beer
with
a
nice
flavorful
brew
id
be
in
heaven
oh
wait
or
is
that
peoples
pint
esb
on
cask
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
taste
is
caramel
toffee
and
bready
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
im
used
to
in
an
apa
nevertheless
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
even
at
6
8
abv
it
is
so
easy
drinking
that
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
light
beige
head
over
the
light
amber
brew
head
is
dense
and
foamy
and
lacing
is
very
nice
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
pale
malts
overrun
by
yeasty
doughy
scent
with
nary
a
hop
in
sightsmell
taste
is
slightly
sweet
light
grain
upfront
quickly
bowing
to
a
tart
middle
and
a
bit
of
a
crisp
hoppy
bite
to
end
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
okay
nothing
particularly
wows
me
here
but
im
not
driven
away
at
all
either
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
well
crafted
quality
brew
nicely
balanced
and
so
enjoyable
i
will
have
this
beer
again
soon
orangeish
color
wellcarbonated
a
thick
foamy
clumping
marshmellow
of
a
head
forms
a
pretty
picture
perfect
beer
some
lemon
peel
cooked
in
sugar
with
a
crispy
crackerlike
malt
nose
highlights
of
more
piney
citrus
and
some
other
fruits
a
very
lively
mouthfeel
combined
with
a
spritzy
flavor
leads
to
a
effervescent
dry
feel
with
a
sour
earthiness
and
a
mildly
tangy
bitterness
all
in
all
quite
enjoyable
very
mild
upfront
with
the
light
crackerlike
malt
flavor
being
the
light
but
primary
impression
just
eversoperfectly
balanced
i
really
enjoyed
this
copper
appearance
almost
clear
slight
haze
is
noted
thin
coating
of
ivory
white
head
lacing
is
adequate
aroma
is
pretty
thick
with
the
caramel
maltiness
and
nougat
like
sweetness
some
hops
are
noted
but
not
enough
good
aroma
anyway
this
pales
got
some
balance
maybe
a
little
too
much
balance
in
favor
of
malt
qualities
but
its
a
pretty
beer
overall
the
midsection
is
heavy
with
caramel
and
nougat
some
piney
hop
tones
prick
the
tongue
every
once
in
a
while
theres
a
lingering
huskiness
and
bitterness
not
really
astringent
but
not
your
typical
apa
bitter
finish
either
decent
enough
beer
and
by
far
the
best
ive
yet
to
encounter
from
cisco
ciscos
whales
tale
offers
a
wonderfully
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
beautiful
appearance
its
full
and
frothy
ivory
head
eventually
settles
to
a
short
cap
of
creamy
foam
that
leaves
rings
and
sheets
of
lace
about
the
glass
and
its
clear
ambercopper
body
reveals
glowing
highlights
of
orange
the
nose
is
clean
and
a
bit
subdued
for
the
style
but
offers
a
nice
combination
of
sweetish
biscuity
and
bready
malt
laced
with
mildly
citrusy
and
floral
hops
a
very
finebubbled
and
moderate
carbonation
leaves
it
smooth
across
the
palate
with
just
a
delicate
zest
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
sweetish
biscuity
malts
return
in
the
flavor
vibrantly
infused
with
the
same
citrusy
tangerine
mild
grapefruit
and
floral
hop
character
found
in
the
nose
and
backed
by
a
brisk
bitterness
that
leads
to
a
dry
and
refreshing
finish
nicely
done
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
and
id
suggest
it
as
a
session
beer
except
for
its
surprising
6
8
alcohol
content
nice
golden
appearance
with
a
small
frothy
head
the
aroma
was
very
dull
not
a
lot
of
hop
presence
for
a
pale
ale
but
the
hops
showed
up
when
it
came
time
for
tasting
it
a
nice
hoppy
taste
that
is
wellrounded
by
the
malts
easy
on
the
palate
and
ohsodrinkable
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
average
but
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
a
good
session
beer
but
if
other
things
are
available
i
might
move
on
comments

i
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
one
at
the
anam
cara
preparty
for
the
2004
belgian
beer
fest
a
pub
full
of
great
beer
and
great
friends
what
more
could
you
ask
for
my
only
regret
was
not
buying
more
of
it
to
hold
in
reserve
as
my
guests
were
somewhat
elated
as
to
where
this
came
from
did
i
have
more
and
could
they
take
a
bottle
home
even
if
it
was
empty
beer
is
good
happy
pale
ale
beering
citrusy
hop
and
flesh
fruit
aroma
is
fresh
and
inviting
hundreds
of
streams
of
carbonation

towards
the

strong
leaving

and
carries
the
flavor
well
a
well
done
tasty
pale
ale
i
still
think
8
for
a
bomber
and
10
a
4pack
is
a
bit
much
a
beautifully
looking
beer
bright
and
clear
orangey
amber
in
color
with
a
soft
carbonation
this
beer
seems
to
glow
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
thin
creamy
peachy
head
tops
the
beer
off
and
leaves
small
crests
of
lace
on
the
glass
a
classic
looking
pale
ale
appealing
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
light
spiced
with
candied
malts
the
taste
is
light
and
grainy
very
flavorful
and
finishes
with
a
light
and
pleasant
fruit
tang
a
musty
earthy
hop
character
is
apparent
along
with
some
nuttiness
very
nice
simple
and
drinkable
big
750ml
bottle
poured
a
peachy
hazy
color
with
typical
carbonation
for
its
style
fantastic
aroma
just
what
a
beer
should
smell
like
anticipated
drink
was
wonderful
clean
mellow
fruity
taste
perfect
blend
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
a
new
favorite
in
this
style
a
great
beer
ok
once
getting
past
the
goofy
name
it
pours
a
rocky
lacy
cream
colored
head
that
settles
out
over
clear
softly
carbonated
deep
goldenbrassy
liquid
nice
breadlike
doughy
nose
with
subtle
hop
tones
the
taste
is
light
fruitiness
with
a
toasty
edge
washed
aside
by
good
bittering
hoppiness
that
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
finishes
nicely
balanced
without
an
overbearing
hop
bite
quite
a
drinkable
ale
here
very
refreshing
and
clean
tasting
i
would
be
happy
drinking
this
all
night
great
version
of
the
style
dead
on
imo
one
of
the
better
apas
out
there
worth
a
try
a
very
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
recedes
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
which
creates
a
nice
lace
very
carbonated
which
is
kind
of
odd
after
most
other
apas
ive
had
recently
but
that
may
have
been
a
result
of
the
tap
it
actually
made
it
quite
refreshing
the
hops
were
very
smooth
and
mild
sweet
too
i
also
noticed
what
tasted
like
banana
hiding
behind
the
hops
and
the
very
subtle
malts
a
very
good
session
beer
found
a
fresh
4
pack
of
this
stuff
at
a
local
store
was
i
was
glad
to
see
it
and
picked
some
up
poured
out
an
amberpeach
color
with
a
nice
head
that
reduced
down
to
lacing
smell
consisted
of
citrus
notes
hops
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
some
spiciness
taste
was
nice
some
citrus
notes
along
with
some
pinelike
hops
hit
the
palate
first
with
some
underlying
malts
and
spiciness
finished
a
little
bit
dry
the
carbonation
was
quite
good
in
this
brew
perhaps
they
fixed
the
problem
this
bottle
seemed
fine
to
me
but
ill
see
what
the
rest
of
them
are
lile
a
good
brew
light
copper
in
color
with
an
orange
tinged
head
hops
suggesting
fruit
appear
in
the
nose
along
with
caramel
and
candyish
malt
in
the
mouth
the
light
body
is
bolstered
by
moderate
bitterness
and
fine
but
plentiful
carbonation
fairly
dry
and
light
in
the
mouth
and
much
restrained
bitterness
with
hints
of
phenols
and
a
metallic
note
very
lackluster
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
mellow
malt
and
light
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
very
nicely
drinkable
and
a
good
session
beer
this
pale
ale
is
a
nice
amber
color
there
is
a
descent
foamy
head
which
lasts
for
some
time
the
smell
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
malty
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
beer
worth
giving
a
try
enjoy
gave
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
while
at
mahars
the
brew
is
labeled
as
a
pale
ale
but
it
did
not
remind
me
of
one
the
brew
poured
to
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
broke
down
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
aromas
where
of
sweet
malt
with
fruity
highlights
think
i
can
sense
some
peach
and
a
bit
of
orange
scents
the
taste
is
very
mellow
starts
somewhat
sweet
with
caramel
highlights
than
breaks
to
some
fruity
flavors
that
seem
to
be
a
somewhat
weird
mix
not
bad
but
a
bit
different
it
also
has
a
slight
bitterness
that
seems
to
complement
the
other
flavors
nicely
over
all
it
is
a
nice
brew
not
one
that
i
am
craving
but
will
give
it
another
chance
in
the
future
the
cap
came
off
like
a
rocket
and
the
head
was
the
biggest
ive
ever
seen
stong
hop
flavor
though
still
seemed
a
little
watered
down
extremely
high
carbonation
i
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
id
like
to
give
this
brew
another
chance
but
because
it
doesnt
have
a
bornon
or
exp
date
im
not
gonna
get
suckered
into
picking
one
of
these
again
ill
try
it
when
cisco
brewers
gets
smart
enough
to
date
their
beers
cought
an
obvious
off
bottle
this
time
cap
came
off
with
a
loud
blast
beer
poured
very
cloudy
super
carbonated
huge
head
that
stayed
and
stayed
off
flavors
of
butterscotch
and
fusilsp
alcohol
sounds
good
huh
to
bad
cuz
i
was
looking
foward
to
try
this
one
oh
well
i
will
give
another
bottle
a
try
someday
hopefully
soon
poured
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
fizzy
and
quite
thick
white
head
that
ended
up
as
a
thick
film
along
the
top
of
the
beer
smell
was
incredibly
interesting
i
am
not
sure
what
to
think
of
it
and
am
unsure
whether
this
was
a
bad
bottle
however
it
didnt
smell
or
taste
bad
just
really
different
the
smell
was
fizzy
and
funky
like
a
lambic
with
the
tart
berry
smell
almost
of
a
framboise
but
it
was
distinctly
different
because
the
berry
was
masked
by
a
hop
presence
not
seen
in
lambics
taste
was
much
more
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
hoppy
lemon
zing
up
front
with
a
good
toasty
malted
middle
and
a
incredibly
refreshing
finish
all
in
all
an
interesting
beer
and
one
i
would
try
again
im
not
so
sure
id
call
this
a
pale
ale
id
say
its
pretty
decent
for
an
amber
ale
the
bottle
is
nice
overall
the
beer
is
a
rather
average
paleamber
ale
if
i
find
myself
on
nantucket
ill
give
it
another
shot
grande
gracias
to
running4beer
for
delivering
this
via
bif
4
lots
of
thick
out
of
control
crazy
head
on
this
one
with
nice
lacing
smells
of
hops
and
malt
and
tastes
of
the
same
lots
of
carbination
starting
trouble
in
the
mouth
before
it
settles
itself
down
and
behaves
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
that
called
to
me
from
the
bottom
shelf
at
gordons
in
waltham
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
get
it
again
if
i
had
something
hoppier
to
choose
according
to
their
website
it
was
intentionally
brewed
to
be
not
so
hoppy
some
people
like
less
hops
some
like
more
im
the
later
so
please
grab
me
a
90
minute
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
it
isnt
a
special
one
judged
strictly
as
a
pale
ale
this
isnt
much
of
one
its
too
fruity
and
way
too
carbonated
it
actually
tastes
a
bit
like
a
lambic
or
a
cross
between
a
light
ale
and
a
really
fruity
belgian
like
the
3
philosophers
the
appearance
is
nice
a
cloudy
apricot
color
with
a
huge
head
that
looks
like
sea
foam
smell
is
extremely
fruity
with
cherry
and
apricots
mixed
with
spice
the
taste
is
very
tart
hinting
at
the
lambic
style
with
the
taste
of
sour
apples
and
limes
the
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
with
tiny
bubbles
hitting
the
tongue
disregarding
style
this
beer
is
intersting
to
drink
and
in
properly
small
quantity
is
good
but
as
a
pale
ale
it
isnt
quite
right
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
at
half
time
in
poughkeepsie
and
discovered
that
it
poured
a
very
foamyappropriately
almost
like
sea
foam
given
that
it
comes
from
nantucketbut
the
liquid
was
clear
and
amber
the
smell
is
very
tart
at
the
outset
with
citrus
overtones
and
not
much
else
and
i
was
interested
to
see
if
the
lemony
tang
would
follow
through
in
the
taste
it
did
to
the
point
that
my
nose
tickled
theres
a
thin
but
sharp
almost
lambic
tint
to
this
pale
ale
im
not
really
sure
what
to
say
because
the
whales
tale
pale
ale
is
a
truely
unusual
experience
it
almost
tastes
like
soy
sauce
i
think
interesting
a
big
thanks
to
noclueaboutbeer
for
hauling
this
one
out
to
kansas
all
the
way
from
connecticut
750ml
bottle
boy
did
this
have
some
carbonation
to
it
it
acted
like
one
of
my
bad
homebrews
it
took
about
10
minutes
to
pour
a
pint
glass
as
all
it
would
do
was
foam
up
it
did
eventually
go
down
and
leave
some
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
it
is
a
very
cloudy
oragngeish
color
aroma
was
a
bit
weak
with
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
and
some
yeast
some
sour
fruits
to
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
not
bad
a
hearty
thanks
to
my
girlfriend
for
getting
this
for
my
birthday
last
week
the
beer
is
copperorange
and
clear
with
a
medium
head
not
foamy
but
bubbly
the
smell
is
hoppy
floral
and
fruity
the
taste
had
hops
but
it
was
not
overly
strong
the
thing
i
seemed
to
notice
most
was
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
real
fruity
smooth
finish
and
very
drinkable
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
their
brews
also
really
cool
bottles
and
caps
the
beer
tastes
slightly
old
with
the
woody
flavor
lending
some
papery
flavor
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
for
my
tastes
although
it
simmers
down
as
the
beer
sits
a
while
if
the
carbonation
was
smoothed
down
a
little
and
the
woodiness
wasnt
so
apparent
this
would
be
a
spectacular
beer
as
it
is
its
a
good
but
not
exceptional
pale
ale
checked
this
one
out
at
redbones
the
other
day
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
didnt
note
any
real
head
i
thought
it
had
a
slightly
sugary
aroma
and
some
mint
family
notes
dont
ask
which
one
i
couldnt
tell
anyway
the
main
thing
i
noticed
was
a
solid
malt
body
with
a
flowery
hop
finish
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
surprising
so
doublechecked
with
sakaroo
in
tha
house
who
assured
me
it
was
supposed
to
taste
this
way
i
think
i
was
looking
for
a
slightly
more
bitter
finish
but
could
not
find
it
in
this
brew
will
want
to
try

the

id
put
my

on

i
certainly
dont
taste

that

lowered

thanks
to
loren
venom
for
sending
this
to
me
i
made
this
my
200
because
i
knew
that
any
beer
that
he
sent
me
would
never
disappoint
and
would
be
worthy
of
a
century
mark
or
2
on
the
last
sip
one
begins
to
wonder
where
it
all
went
wrong
this
ale
seems
to
have
some
real
substance
but
it
just
never
comes
together
harmoniously
im
certainly
hoping
that
the
carbonation
issue
with
my
sample
was
simply
a
fluke
but
its
worth
reviewing
for
just
that
reasonto
help
keep
bas
informed
note
i
have
had
repeated
problems
with
the
carbonation
and
the
size
of
the
head
on
this
beer
multiple
samples
different
purchases
over
a
period
of
three
months
even
with
a
very
delicate
pour
the
head
is
out
of
control
i
e
well
over
three
inches
and
this
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
judge
the
beers
appearance
distorted
mouthfeel
way
too
fizzy
and
drinkability
annoying
i
plan
on
returning
to
this
one
in
a
few
months
with
the
hope
that
these
problems
will
be
corrected
so
that
i
can
adjust
my
review
accordingly
12403
currently
drinking
the
750ml
version
noticeably
more
carbonation
with
a
denser
creamier
head
that
works
very
well
in
smoothing
out
the
beer
also
a
more
prominent
yeast
flavor
dare
i
say
overabundant
which
i
have
noticed
in
other
cisco
beers
while
this
is
still
very
good
i
have
to
recommend
the
smaller
bottle
which
will
seem
perverse
to
many
seasoned
beer
drinkers
however
the
smaller
bottle
has
a
truer
pale
ale
flavor
with
less
yeast
sweeter
malts
and
more
prominent
hops
it
is
also
more
bang
for
your
buck
my
4pack
of
12ozers
was

i
believe
the
750
is
typically

it
some
places
it
may
be
cheaper

taste
is
primarily
hoppy
with
a
citric

a

brew
id
return
to
with
no

pours
a
nice
cloudy
peach
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
slowly
and
leaves
a
monster
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
subtle
earthy
hops
with
a
bit
of
fruitenes
thrown
in
and
some
light
biscuity
malt
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
mild
biscuity
maltiness
before
going
to
a
great
light
fruity
flavor
that
is
accompanied
by
just
enough
hop
bitterness
for
the
rest
of
the
brew
this
is
one
seriously
carbonated
brew
as
all
of
ciscos
beers
seem
to
be
be
but
it
remains
creamy
and
crisp
and
exceedingly
drinkable
i
need
to
try
some
cisco
brews
on
draught
and
that
is
all
their
is
to
it
id
definitely
have
this
again
ontap
and
in
fact
prefer
it
over
the
bottle
cisco
lists
this
one
as
an
ipa
but
its
bitterness
is
closer
to
an
american
pale
the
brew
is
unfiltered
which
is
fine
from
the
tap
but
creates
way
too
much
carbonation
from
the
bottle
whales
tale
has
a
distinct
earthygrassy
character
which
definitely
is
a
plus
this
is
a
unique
beer
in
its
style
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
fine
beer
that
has
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
while
not
being
to
overwhelming
to
preclude
it
from
being
sessionable

sight
this
beer

overall
this
is

this
beer
got
me
into
odell
a
great
example
of
an
englishstyle
pale
ale
no
real
smell
or
taste
too
blah
for
me
too
bland
of
a
taste
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
abundant
fresh
hops
character
of
this
brew
it
is
highly
aromatic
however
the
palate
was
a
bit
dry
for
my
taste
lacking
a
solid
malt
backbone
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
my
reference
for
this
sort
of
style
is
the
anchor
liberty
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
odell
5
barrel
is
still
very

of
my

nuff
said
ok
its
easy
to
drink
while
watching
the

if
a

unbalanced
just
like
the
nfl
this
is
a
hoppy
pale
ale
and
it
goes
great
with
barbecue
5
barrel
is
a
modified
recipe
from
their
older
pale
ale
and
it
seems
to
have
been
a
successful
tweak
its
light
but
not
too
light
thanks
to
the
hops
there
are
just
a
wee
bit
too
much
of
them
for
my
taste
but
i
dont
like
hoppy
ipatype
beers
very
much
so
there
you
go
still
worth
a
shot
in
the
summer
out
on
the
patio
i
prefer
other
odell
beers
more
but
i
like
everything
they
put
out
so
its
not
like
i
wouldnt
drink
this
if
given
the
opportunity
o
a
great
tasting
light
pale
ale
light
brown
to
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
haziness
an
inch
thick
rocky
white
head
is
present
aroma
of
piney
hops
dominates
and
light
malt
is
faint
the
piney
hops
are
also
at
the
front
of
the
palate
i
also
get
some
light
grains
but
they
struggle
to
make
their
presence
known
throughout
even
the
fade
this
beer
is
dry
and
crisp
it
just
seems
more
like
an
ipa
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
love
to
have
it
again
may
have
to
pick
up
a
growler
would
probably
have
again
worth
trying
if
youre
curious
flavor
kind
of
an
odd
combination
the
floral
hops
are
dominate
with
some
citrus
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
malt
flavor
is
mild
and
this
beer
seems
to
need
some
more
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
a
beer
for
all
year
round
i
feel
it
would
go
down
great
with
a
summer
bbq
overall
this
is
just
a
solid
flagship
beer
for
a
pretty
awesome
brewery
nothing
groundbreaking
as
far
as
an
english
pale
goes
but
still
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
a
light
medium
with
a
nice
balance
good
sweetness
with
only
a
touch
of
bitterness
blended
in
with
medium
carbonation
level
butteryoily
feel
that
has
a
spicy
dry
finish
really
nice
drinkable
anytime
brew
safe
beer

o
a
fine
pale
ale
no
doubt
goes
down
with
ease
nothing
about
it
screams
world
class
but
one
that
is
certainly
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
actually
its
great
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
it
but
i
honestly
can
say
that
i
would
probably
opt
for
this
one
over
stones
pale
ale
which
i
had
before
this
the
hop
bitterness
comes
through
just
enough
to
be
enjoyable
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
other
flavors
offered
in
this
brew
where
it
lacks
in
the
smell
department
it
makes
up
for
in
the
taste
and
mouth
department
i
also
quite
like
the
bottle
nicely
designed
and
a
quality
label
go
ahead
and
pick
up
a
couple
of
these
and
you
wont
regret
it
nice
example
of
a
english
pale
ale
i
truely
enjoyed
the
very
full
hop
taste
it
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
citrus
which
add
to
the
experience
avery
good
beer
in
my
opinion
but
i
have
just
recently
started
drinking
ipas
so
this
review
is
my
first
first
of
many
i
hope
i
hope
you
all
dont
rip
me
up
to
much
with
this
not
much
of
a
writer
still
working
on
it
o
a
bitter
somewhat
fruity
beer
with
a
big
hop
nose
this
is
fairly
bland
and
just
not
that
exciting
pretty
nice
nothing
super
exciting
but
a
nice
basic
english
pale
ale
that
id
definitely
reach
for
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
overall
probably
my
least
favorite
brew
from
odell
but
it
is
still
a
wellrounded
pale
ale
overall
a
very
very
nice
everyday
pale
complex
enough
to
make
it
interesting
light
and
clean
enough
to
have
with
pasta
for
dinner
recommended
a
very
good
beer
for
my
first
try
at
odells
good
thing
i
have
a
few
more
in
my
hotel
bathroom
sink

oin
the
past
i
was
never
a
huge
odell
fan
but
recently
their
beers
have
impressed
me
five
barrel
is
no
exception
the
citrusy
spicy
notes
play
well
with
the
biscuity
malts
here
just
like
they
are
supposed
to
is
this
beer
a
worldbeater
no
but
it
is
widely
available
around
here
even
at
crappy
chain
restaurants
and
i
would
happily
drink
this
when
other
options
do
not
exist
overall
a
pretty
good
exploration
of
hops
in
this
a
lot
to
like
about
it
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
pale
ale
nothing
too
exciting
or
unique
but
a
superbly
wellbalanced
and
refreshing
beer
with
a
pleasant
aroma
and
flavor
odell
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
find
me
an
odell
beer
that
isnt
great
and
i
will
drink
it
hopefully
when
we
start
writing
our
book
we
will
be
able
to
visit
odell
and
see
things
from
inside
the
facility
if
nothing
else
we
will
go
tour
the
brewery
and
just
drink
their
beer
moderately
hopped
for
the
style
a
just
a
great
looking
beer
aroma
didnt
really
wow
me
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
drink
again
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
clear
orange
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
leaves
a
great
lacing
on
the
glass
and
a
thin
retention
over
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
mild
hop
and
malt
aroma
that
seems
well
balanced
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
its
got
a
nice
maltiness
as
well
have
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
flavors
are
good
across
the
board
on
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
very
drinkable
overall
its
a
good
brew
very
sessionable
overall
a
real
straight
forward
solid
odell
creation
great
stuff
o
solid
representation
of
the
style
a
nice
balanced
hoppiness
to
it
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
levels
of
carbonation
that
foam
the
beer
slightly
across
the
palate
the
result
is
a
generally
smooth
easydrinking
pale
ale
that
finishes
quite
dry
and
astringent
pours
a
murky
rust
orange
with
low
head
slight
lacing
smells
like
an
ale
bready
yeasty
with
some
low
deep
notes
of
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
competent
bready
with
some
lingering
bitterness
but
mostly
straight
ahead
ale
carbonation
is
moderate
but
tame
and
not
at
all
assertive
this
is
nothing
as
amazing
as
their
signature
ipa
and
while
well
crafted
is
just
good
and
not
repeater
good
if
you
know
what
i
mean
a
nice
beer
and
one
that
was
quite
enjoyable
despite
not
being
as
good
as
i
had
been
hoping
less
hops
and
more
malt
than
i
was
expecting
and
a
little
flat
towards
the
end
but
still
an
acceptable
effort
from
the
brewery
taste
is
pine
hops
with
plenty
of
body
and
a
heavy
malt
presence
to
balance
it
all
out
overall
this
is
a
remarkably
wellbalanced
session
pale
ale
with
a
superlative
taste
and
nice
body
better
than
many
ipas
final
thoughts
odell
brewing
does
it
again
their
5
barrel
pale
ale
rings
true
to
the
style
while
offering
a
taste
and
feel
that
makes
it
unique
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
apas
ive
had
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
i
could
see
this
beer
being
enjoyed
by
curious
macrodrinkers
and
it
even
pleases
a
hop
head
like
myself
m
crisp
and
light
on
the
palate
with
some
balanced
minerality
finishes
very
dry
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
the
more
i
liked
it
the
flavor
profile
has
enough
going
to
on
to
keep
the
drinker
interested
yet
things
never
seem
to
quite
gel
perfectly
i
would
get
this
again
at
a
bar
or
in
a
variety
pack
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
a
six
of
it
overall
its
rich
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
drink
this
all
day
lets
hope
this
is
available
where
im
moving
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
medium
amber
with
good
head
and
acceptable
lacing
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
bready
malt
with
some
sharp
citrus
hops
taste
has
a
decent
hop
profile
but
dominated
by
the
bready
malt
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
limp
but
nice
dry
finish
seems
like
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
on
tap
at
an
english
pub
but
as
a
standalone
taste
test
out
of
the
bottle
its
a
little
blah
overall
pretty
descent
pale
ale
though
i
feel
it
leans
more
towards
an
american
pa
as
opposed
to
a
british
one
the
hops
just
seem
a
bit
to
overpowering
to
be
a
british
pa
imo
wish
i
had
a
few
more
to
put
down
very
nice
malty
pale
ale
here

overall
not
bad
just
nothing
special
this
pours
a
murky
ambergolden
tan
like
a
crusty
bread
thats
been
toasted
theres
a
light
hop
aroma
and
a
malt
sweetness
rounding
out
the
nose
flavor
is
more
malt
than
hop
with
just
a
tiny
hop
bite
at
the
end
and
more
on
the
sweet
side
of
things
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
did
very
much
enjoy
having
it
i
would
share
this
one
with
people
new
to
the
craft
beer
world
of
flavors
it
will
not
overwhelm
them
pours
a
brassy
orange
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
off
white
head
head
recedes
quickly
but
leaves
some
thick
lacing
and
a
nice
cap
nose
is
a
bit
faint
bready
malts
and
faint
hop
aromas
taste
is
nicely
subtle
excellent
balance
between
bready
earthy
malts
and
herbal
hops
nice
and
even
throughout
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
but
slightly
sticky
finish
easy
drinking
too
could
throw
a
few
of
these
back
easily
a
solid
brew
that
scratched
that
lighter
but
tasty
itch
i
had
overall
this
is
well
balanced
and
is
one
i
will
consider
for
when
i
am
craving
something
citrusy

o
overall
a
slightly
less
hoppy
pale
ale
still
very
tasty
and
as
others
have
said
this
would
be
a
great
for
a
session
brew
a
well
done
drink
great
as
a
session
brew
pours
copper
with
a
nice
off
white
head
aroma
is
floral
biscuity
a
touch
of
herbs
and
some
citrus
rind
taste
follows
suit
a
creamy
active
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
and
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
quite
sessionable
not
my
favorote
odell
offering
but
it
grows
on
me
the
more
i
drink
it
o
overally
excellent
session
beer
this
reminds
me
so
much
of
summit
epa
its
a
great
craft
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
will
i
buy
it
again
ill
stick
to
the
local
guy
summit
epa
but
if
i
lived
near
colorado
this
would
be
my
go
to
session
brew
well
done
odell
pours
a
clear
brass
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
is
a
minty
piney
aroma
taste
is
a
bit
of
herbal
minty
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
thin
caramel
middle
and
a
resinous
apricot
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
very
nice
low
carbonation
levels
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
dr
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
id
have
it
on
draught
its
pretty
decent
o
above
average
d
a
fair
introduction
to
craft
but
far
from
anything
special
m
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
fits
the
style
solid
epa
o
this
was
just
a
full
flavored
experience
great
development
from
beginning
to
end
every
now
and
then
i
enjoy
good
malt
forward
english
style
pale
ale
sure
beats
some
of
the
alternatives
coming
out
of
england
o
a
good
pale
ale
a
touch
sweet
but
definitely
not
to
sweet
would
like
just
a
tad
bit
more
bitterness
in
it
o
a
tasty
english
pale
ale
with
a
flavour
profile
suitable
for
the
style
nothing
over
the
top
but
a
very
pleasurable
ale
to
consume
drink
not
too
shabby
this
was
a
lot
more
flavorful
than
i
thought
it
would
be
more
of
a
mellow
balance
and
earthy
a
very
solid
pale
ale
overall
impression
wow
this
brew
is
all
over
the
place
starts
with
an
awesome
pour
but
then
the
aroma
is
too
light
and
offbalanced
the
taste
then
is
amazing
but
then
finishes
strange
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
ontap
and
wouldnt
mind
getting
it
in
a
bottle
again
to
compare
i
like
odell
brewing
co
a
ton
and
will
be
a
huge
advocate
of
their
brews
while
im
in
colorado
and
while
in
st
louis
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
but
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
and
would
easily
down
a
few
of
these
overall
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
very
flavorful
pale
ale
though
i
suspect
this
has
more
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this
is
an
english
pale
ale
as
oppose
to
an
american
pale
ale
a
great
all
purpose
pale
ale
this
one
smells
of
a
cournicopia
of
different
hop
varieties
and
has
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
mouthfeel
is
bright
with
a
medium
body
extremely
refreshing
taste
is
constantly
evolving
hop
essences
and
malt
balance
this
is
a
winner
a
trusty
daily
drink
odell
continues
to
impress
me
their
beers
are
always
visually
appealing
with
great
aroma
and
high
drinkability
and
this
one
is
no
different
very
nice
hop
and
malt
mix
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
solid
tan
head
with
lacing
attractive
amber
body
with
swirling
bubbles
tasty
malt
flavors
including
a
nice
sweetness
and
toastiness
flavorful
drying
and
bittering
finish
the
total
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
and
the
parts
are
pretty
good
overall
a
good
representative
pale
ale
o
i
thought
this
was
a
great
example
of
an
epa
so
i
gave
it
extra
points
its
not
very
strong
in
any
area
it
focuses
more
on
the
overall
package
and
the
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
sure
nothing
too
strong
or
overpowering
about
any
aspect
just
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
brew
o
very
drinkable
decided
to
try
this
one
after
not
having
it
for
awhile
do
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
it
came
down
to
it
low
enough
in
abv
but
very
tasty
for
what
it
is
loved
burping
it
up
perhaps
the
best
tasting
english
pale
ale
ive
had
to
date
props
odell
serving
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
great
pale
ale
overall
and
wish
i
had
access
to
it
oin
a
world
where
there
are
so
many
over
the
top
ipas
and
iipas
this
beer
holds
back
and
provides
a
nice
pale
ale
this
beer
should
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
its
an
english
pale
not
an
ipa
nice
work
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
o
a
nice
relaxing
brew
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
one
to
seek
but
a
must
try
if
youre
able
to
find
we
sampled
this
one
at
the
odell
taproom
with
some
friends
a
few
saturdays
ago
poured
a
nice
copperamber
color
with
some
decent
cloudy
white
foam
on
top
aromas
of
caramel
light
brown
sugar
and
some
floral
hops
on
the
palate
light
bodied
with
caramel
biscuit
and
a
hint
of
hops
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
with
a
fluffy
white
one
finger
head
really
great
retention
this
beer
was
poured
10
or
15
minutes
ago
and
the
head
seems
to
be
in
the
same
place
as
when
it
was
poured
floral
hops
on
the
nose
touch
of
husky
grain
and
a
bit
of
fruit
nectarines
definitely
something
on
the
lighter
side
decent
fruity
body
up
front
on
the
mid
palate
i
had
a
strong
association
with
iced
tea
floral
hoppiness
on
the
end
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
definitely
not
what
i
would
describe
as
a
hoppy
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
pale
ale
that
i
would
definitely
buy
when
i
am
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
quaffable
o
would
like
to
try
again
interesting
beer

for
a
6
pack
picked
up
in
rock
springs
wyoming
not
too
far
from
where
it
was

would
probably
skip
over
this
one
thanks

this

leaving

the

quite
muddled

not
mich
is
picked
up
but
faint

offerings
the
taste
has
some
off
putting
flavors
akin
to
an
aluminium
can
some
hops
show
but
not
as
much
as
a
sweet
caramel
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carb
overall
this
is
a
very
basic
normative
pale
ale
you
could
session
it
but
it
wont
draw
any
new
conclusions
for
you
i
have
just
found
my
fall
back
beer
i
will
have
this
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
great
pale
ale
overyall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
could
easily
session
these
on
a
hot

day

that
will
find
me
coming
back
to
again
and
again
overall
english
style
yes
fairly
thirst
quenching
o
extremely
pleasant
one
overall
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
drink
a
wonderful
brew
full
of
lively
citrus
character
in
aroma
and
taste
this
is
a
beer
to
savour
by
the
bottle
but
equally
drinkable
in
quantity
pretty
much
ticks
all
the
boxes
for
what
im
looking
for
in
a
beer
and
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
pale
ale
a
decent
offering
session
beer
with
enough
body
and
good
flavor
but
next
time
im
not
gonna
sit
on
it
too
long

good
great

for
a
pale
ale
along
with
a
mild

i
have
been
in
an
ipa
cycle
but
decided
to
move
slightly
downstream
and
try
an
odell
five
barrel
pale
ale
the
color
is
deep
for
a
pale
ale
and
the
head
appropriate
the
aroma
is
very
subtle
flavor
is
very
even
balanced
nicely
at
the
midpoint
between
sweet
and
bitter
the
very
tale
end
of
the
aftertaste
turns
toward
bitter
a
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
will
go
well
with
food
drinkability
its
good
would
probably
be
better
from
a
cask
or
on
tap
overall
its
a
satisfying
if
unoriginal
beer
12
oz
bottle
with
somewhat
decipherable
freshness
date
hopped
four
times
in
the
boil
run
through
a
hopback
then
dryhopped
36
ibus
pours
a
light
chestnut
with
medium
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
loose
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
chunks
of
lacing
toasted
and
biscuit
malts
in
the
nose
with
darker
caramel
malts
and
juicy
oily
hops
that
contribute
citrus
and
pine
much
the
same
on
the
palate
if
a
bit
watery
with
medium
bitterness
and
nutty
yeast
that
help
fill
out
the
flavor
it
has
a
medium
weight
with
tonguedrying
crispness
and
a
lingering
finish
this
is
a
pleasant
and
enjoyable
brew
and
makes
for
an
easy
session
ale
i
used
a
gentle
slow
pour
which
did
not
create
more
than
wisps
for
head
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
an
interesting
grassy
hop
character
mmmm
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
hops
were
muted
like
drinking
hop
tea
man
i
was
really
starting
to
feel
mellow
drinking
this
beer
finish
continued
with
the
grassy
hoppiness
and
i
just
slipped
away
into
slumberland
zzzz
very
nice
tasted
of
pine
light
grass
some
minimal
malt
sweetness
very
dry
finish
with
a
good
mouth
feel
and
good
taste
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
on
draught
but
i
dont
find
it
as
a
real
representative
of
an
english
pale
ale
at
all
if
that
was
what
odell
had
intended
this
is
really
a
highly
drinkable
beer
due
to
its
managable
abv
clarity
and
refreshing
trait
a
good
one
to
hand
out
to
your
nonba
friends
to
possibly
get
them
started
this
has
been
a
favorite
of
mine
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
afternoon
d
not
really
a
spectacular
pale
ale
the
aftertaste
is
really
hard
to
ignore
d
id
like
to
have
another
one
of
these
the
lack
of
aftertaste
and
nice
mouthfeel
make
this
super
drinkable
i
did
find
that
listening
to
80s
music
cue
talking
heads
this
must
be
the
place
while
drinking
this
enhances
its
drinkability
though
im
sure
you
could
say
that
about
any
beer
right
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
about
two
fingers
to
start
out
a
bit
of
light
lacing
nose
brings
some
floral
and
citrus
hops
along
with
some
light
malt
slight
hoppy
bitterness
with
some
floral
notes
in
the
taste
some
light
grain
as
well
good
feel
with
some
mild
bitterness
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
drinks
fairly
well
these
guys
make
some
really
lovely
beer
beer
is
light
in
body
and
soapy
its
kind
of
gross
its
thin
and
watery
with
odd
bitterness
and
a
mild
aftertaste
its
difficult
to
drink
but
im
bored
and
drink
the
whole
thing
anyway
time
for
bed
sucks
that
this
is
my
send
off
beer
wont
be
drinking
this
again
drinkability
high
finish
is
pleasant
and
at
5
2
quite
sessionable
i
could
have
a
few
a
unique
and
compulsively
sippable
pale
ale
if
pale
ales
are
your
thing
this
a
keeper
for
me
a
little
more
crispness
and
less
woodpineyness
and
it
would
be
far
better
for
some
delicious
drinking

thick

offwhite
with
good
retention
and
producing
a
small
amount
of
lace
subdued
aroma
some
piney
hops
but
very
little
of
much
else
soft
feel
up
front
despite
the
visible
carbonation
citrus
and
subtly
floral
hops
present
in
the
middle
and
end
with
some
apple
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
with
very
well
balanced
finish
worthy
of
a
second
d
its
ok
its
better
than
average
for
sure
but
nothing
i
would
need
to
seek
out
again
i
would
recommend
everyone
try
it
but
not
before
some
other
beers
as
well
d
a
satisfying
tasty
pale
ale
would
go
with
this
over
snpa
given
the
choice
really
nice
brew
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
and
it
has
a
bitter
finish
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
worthy
of
trying
i
would
not
mind
having
this
again
sometime
drinks
ok
im
not
in
a
huge
rush
to
get
another
sixer
but
i
could
see
purchasing
it
again
in
the
future
overall
a
very
swiggable
pale
ale
and
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
a
very
americanized
version
of
the
style
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
stuck
around
forever
and
left
some
chunky
lacing
down
the
glass
looks
delicious
aroma
is
lightly
hoppy
some
peppery
notes
grassiness
herbal
backed
up
by
some
pale
malt
sweetness
nice
tasting
beer
the
hops
surprised
me
as
they
are
quite
fruity
citrusy
and
refreshing
as
opposed
to
the
largely
herbal
qualities
of
the
aroma
crisp
dry
refreshing
beer
malt
and
hops
are
balanced
very
well
bitterness
is
low
needs
a
little
more
body
but
much
like
the
90
shilling
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
smooth
almost
creamy
lots
of
carbonation
but
its
not
prickly
overall
a
great
sessionable
beer
not
bad
just
does
not
resemble
an
english
pale
ale
at
all
i
could
tell
that
right
away
from
the
nose
they
really
missed
the
style
if
indeed
it
is
intended
to
be
english
along
with
the
palate
burning
bitterness
this
is
not
something
i
will
revisit
often
this
would
be
a
good
pale
for
a
brisk
fall
afternoon
not
bad
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
d
a
very
well
balanced
brew
that
is
not
overpowering
good
for
23
well
worth
a
try
d
good
drinker
medium
bodied
not
a
strong
hop
brew
but
very
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
this
brew
odell
5
barrel
pale
ale
pours
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
aroma
is
very
faint
sort
of
biscuity
with
more
smell
of
malt
than
hops
taste
is
balanced
and
representative
of
this
type
of
beer
hops
taste
more
floral
than
anything
malt
is
significant
but
not
sweet
and
finish
is
relatively
bitter
mouthfeel
is
decent
drinkability
ok
drinkability
could
drink
this
all
night
slightly
interesting
just
what
im
looking
for
in
a
session
beer
powdery
toasted
mlat
that
seems
to
have
that
pilsner
malt
flavor
maybe
just
a
hint
of
biscuits
as
the
palate
loses
some
of
that
pwodery
feel
in
the
middle
the
hops
add
just
a
little
touch
of
lemon
and
crispness
the
palate
finishes
semidry
and
flat
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
in
which
i
could
sit
and
have
a
few
at
a
time
nice
floral
and
malt
aroma
clean
taste
and
goes
down
really
light
hops
are
present
but
but
not
overpowering
subtle
malts
and
just
a
very
good
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
few
without
getting
full
or
giving
up
flavor
in
the
end
it
didnt
stick
out
as
something
id
rush
out
to
buy
again
but
not
disappointed
either
on
sale
for
7
99
and
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
at
anything
higher
than
that
good
drinkablility
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
paired
with
food
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
and
beige
ring
and
some
lacing
smell
is
floral
with
citrus
hops
and
malts
but
faint
tatse
is
some
nice
citrus
hops
some
caramel
malts
toffee
and
a
sweet
smooth
finish
mouth
feel
is
light
medium
a
little
thin
but
fits
the
bill
for
the
taste
buds
not
the
most
flavorful
epa
or
apa
but
drinkable
and
flavorful
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
will
buy
this
one
again
in
singles
2
or
3
at
a
time
drinkability
one
of
the
better
english
pale
ales
i
have
had
with
a
great
balance
slightly
rampedup
hops
and
a
nice
feel
overall
clear
copper
pour
with
nice
head
and
decent
lacing
perfumy
floral
nose
with
hints
of
toffee
malt
the
taste
is
very
subdued
even
for
a
pale
ale
malt
dominates
with
an
odd
squash
aftertaste
that
slowly
fades
reminiscent
of
a
british
ipa
the
aftertaste
hurts
the
drinkability
for
me
an
average
at
best
pale
ale
d
drinkability
is
certainly
high
on
this
one
ive
had
it
a
few
times
now
and
always
have
enjoyed
it
pale
fuzzy
peach
body
thin
bubbly
ivory
white
head
lace
comes
in
sporadic
rings
nice
little
aroma
of
hops
a
little
citrus
a
little
pungent
a
little
resiny
on
the
palate
the
malt
base
could
use
just
a
bit
of
a
boost
as
is
i
get
some
toffeeish
malt
tones
hops
adds
some
lemon
and
citrus
to
the
mix
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
subdued
decent
enough
but
nothing
im
gonna
need
to
seek
again
like
the
st
lupulin
or
the
ipa
poured
from
a
12oz
into
a
pint
it
has
a
nice
natural
orange
hue
as
opposed
to
a
orange
soda
color
very
large
head
with
long
lasting
glass
coating
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
earthy
goodness
and
some
floral
notes
up
front
laid
back
but
nice
the
taste
is
malty
but
crisp
and
not
too
sweet
a
nice
little
hop
kick
in
the
end
it
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
goes
down
smooth
i
would
drink
this
if
i
could
find
it
here
in
sf
thanks
to
my
cousin
for
getting
married
and
giving
me
an
excuse
to
try
this
out
in
colorado
and
to
hang
out
with
family
again
anyway
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
my
first
from
odell
this
is
a
basic
plain
pale
ale
not
much
special
about
the
nose
or
flavor
the
flavor
has
some
nice
malts
and
a
little
bitter
kick
that
makes
it
a
nice
multiple
drinker
the
bitter
lingers
and
cleans
the
palate
so
you
will
come
back
for
more
but
overall
nothing
special
about
this
one
this
a
tasty
complex
ale
one
im
going
to
have
to
give
some
consideration
to
again
and
again
delicious
hoppy
pale
ale
with
tasty
tasty
malt
mmmmm
taste
of
wood
seems
consistent
with
a
lot
of
the
odells
grainy
not
exactly
west
coast
pale
nor
british
really
tastes
closer
to
an
amber
ale
than
the
pales
im
used
to
neat
to
check
out
once
but
wouldnt
see
myself
purchasing
this
at
7
99
anytime
soon
tasting
notes
hoppy
smells
earthy
with
lots
of
grapefruit
and
marijuana
crisp
and
well
carbonated
clean
finish
a
bit
more
bitter
than
your
typical
pale
ale
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
lackluster
beer
but
still
easy
to
drink
and
one
which
would
be
fitting
on
a
hot
day
d
im
not
completely
impressed
with
the
taste
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
a
few
of
these
alcohol
isnt
too
heavy
and
it
is
rather
refreshing
mostly
clear
with
a
slight
haze
amber
with
a
fine
eggshell
cap
and
tons
of
lace
the
aroma
was
mostly
citrus
tangerine
with
slight
malt
moderate
bitterness
with
orange
floral
and
citrus
notes
slight
toastiness
medium
to
light
bodied
lowish
carbonation
and
dry
a
good
pint
of
pale
ale
d
decent
drinkability
the
lingering
bitterness
gets
old
as
you
make
your
way
through
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
too
loose
and
fizzy
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
style
and
i
scored
it
that
way
for
the
first
4
elements
for
personal
drinkability
it
was
good
but
not
something
that
id
want
a
6
pack
of
odells
has
plenty
of
other
great
beers
that
id
rather
stock
up
on
rotation
not
avail
in
tx
so
got
thru
ummagum
not
bad
but
others
that
id
rather
have
again
so
this
is
just
a
one
timer
for
me
1style
overall
a
great
americanized
version
of
the
classic
british
pale
ale
d
good
drinking
pale
ale
that
was
ruined
slightly
by
the
metallic
overtones
to
it
would
love
to
try
it
again
actually
i
could
see
this
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
d
a
nice
english
pale
ale
great
balance
and
subtlety
of
traditional
english
flavors
throughout
definitely
could
put
back
34
of
these
in
an
hour
no
problem
if
it
were
readily
available
it
would
be
a
staple
per
the
label
this
is
produced
on
there
pilot
5
barrel
system
not
the
large
one
with
a
very
aggressive
hoping
schedule
beer
poured
an
amber
orange
with
a
solid
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing
behind
nose
is
caramel
malts
and
fresh
citrusy
hops
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
caramel
malts
and
a
medley
of
citrus
melon
and
piney
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
lot
of
flavor
is
packed
into
this
sessionable
pale
ale
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
even
though
i
didnt
find
it
too
intriguing
ill
give
it
credit
for
being
a
sessionable
option
with
decent
hoppiness
if
you
arent
asking
for
much
this
will
do
just
fine
im
disappointed
on
the
wholeodell
makes
some
fantastic
beers
but
this
just
isnt
up
to
par
theres
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
it
but
it
lacks
anything
to
make
me
want
to
drink
it
again
another
solid
beer
by
odellvery
underated
brewery
i
say
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
very
easily
for
a
snazy
looking
bottle
this
beer
leaves
much
to
be
desired
proclaiming
itself
as
bountiful
in
hop
flavor
due
to
4
different
boiling
hops
this
beer
is
a
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
tasting
mostly
bittering
hops
with
very
few
complexities
andor
floral
notes
lacing
is
poor
and
aroma
is
uninspiring
not
sure
why
i
see
this
all
over
the
place
perhaps
youll
like
it
or
perhaps
youll
wonder
why
someone
would
think
this
one
special
like
me
handcarried
from
my
hometown
greeley
co
thanks
nj
i
got
an
email
from
n
while
they
were
in
greeley
and
he
said
this
one
was
a
keeper
now
i
know
why
an
exceptionally
drinkable
offering
from
one
of
the
best
craft
breweries
this
is
good
stuff
and
im
glad
i
still
have
one
bottle
left
the
beer
poured
gorgeous
gold
into
the
glass
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipated
and
left
very
delicate
lacing
on
the
glass
very
subtle
fruity
piney
hops
were
evident
in
the
nose
and
that
carried
into
initial
taste
nice
balance
of
sweetness
very
light
but
pleasantly
noticeable
and
the
aforementioned
hops
with
a
moderate
malty
body
punctuated
by
delicate
carbonation
those
are
two
words
id
use
a
lot
with
this
beer
delicate
and
subtle
nothing
in
your
face
about
it
no
alcohol
taste
at
all
with
a
very
slight
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
i
never
put
the
glass
downand
it
tasted
great
right
through
to
the
warmer
last
few
swallows
its
an
excellent
session
beer
youd
never
grow
tired
of
clearly
a
winner
all
the
way
around

kudos

mild

floral

herbal

qualities
a
little
ash
is
detected
as
well
did
i
mention
how
weak
the
aroma
was
herbal
and
earthy
hop
flavor
a
touch
of
pine
as
well
mild
biscuit
malt
and
even
some
yeast
esters
giving
some
complex
flavors
low
bitterness
for
some
decent
hoppy
flavors
mild
yet
complex
lighter
body
with
a
soft
effervescent
carbonation
lively
and
dynamic
well
done
pale
ale
nice
lighter
body
and
low
abv
bitterness
will
not
wear
the
palate
out
very
sessionable
pretty
good
a
little
different
the
beer
had
a
light
body
to
it
the
beer
was
smooth
clean
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
definitely
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
that
i
have
had
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
could
possibly
use
a
little
more
on
the
hop
side
of
things
but
still
a
well
done
pale
d
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
between
the
hops
and
malts
they
played
off
each
other
well
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
drinkability
pleasant
and
exceedingly
drinkable
while
providing
ample
flavor
all
the
while
recommended
provided
you
dig
light
pale
ales
this
beer
goes
down
purty
dern
easy
and
its
got
plenty
of
character
to
stay
exciting
sessionable
for
sure
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
tried
odell
rocks
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
really
malty
biscuit
smelly
beer
very
nice
smell
unfortunately
that
was
the
high
point
for
me
with
this
one
it
was
well
crafted
and
the
taste
was
perfectly
fine
it
just
didnt
wow
me
it
all
seemed
a
bit
muddled
fantastic
ingredients
and
tons
of
care
just
nothing
really
remarkable
that
grabbed
you
and
made
you
want
to
have
another
a
perfectly
decent
effort
you
just
kinda
wonder
what
could
have
been
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
no
haze
whatsoever
smells
of
fine
english
malts
with
just
a
tad
of
hops
present
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
tasty
smooth
and
malty
clean
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
d
a
decent
english
pale
ale
with
a
clear
dedication
to
quality
crafting
but
the
hops
influence
is
a
bit
muddled
and
its
abruptness
make
it
not
a
topnotch
session
beer
candidate
which
is
what
this
style
is
meant
to
be
as
it
warms
the
flavors
come
out
this
one
is
very
drinkable
this
one
has
a
pretty
full
malt
body
to
go
along
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
not
an
abundance
of
hop
flavors
there
is
the
mildly
toasty
coppery
tang
again
in
the
taste
not
too
fond
of
that
maybe
it
is
the
fact
this
is
supposed
to
be
english
style
and
they
tried
to
give
it
some
minerality
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
fairly
good
pa
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
great
alone
or
with
a
meal
anytime
of
the
year
the
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
aroma
characteristics
with
a
spicy
dry
finish
and
a
dryness
which
continues
to
parch
the
mouth
into
the
aftertaste
lots
o
hops
in
this
one
so
much
so
that
the
mouth
feel
is
prickly
from
them
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
sessionable
mouth

may
be
best
enjoyed
when
youre
looking
for
a
summertime
refresher
md
there
was
something
about
the
finish
that
bothered
me
kind
of
a
harsh
finish
to
a
overall
bland
tasting
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
search
this
one
out
again
i
had
this
at
a
pub
in
denver
the
locals
were
raving
about
it
i
thought
it
was
good
but
not
enough
to
make
me
rave
a
rather
mediocre
orangish
color
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
rather
mild
nose
for
a
pa
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
maltiness
perhaps
more
than
most
american
pas
have
good
carbonation
makes
this
sparkly
and
refreshing
the
best
part
of
the
taste
is
a
nice
pronounced
bitter
finish
and
aftertaste
thanks
waltonc
you
could
drink
it
but
only
if
you
went
fast
enough
to
never
notice
the
aftertaste
not
a
beer
you
want
to
let
linger

dgood
pale
ale
very
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
in
any
particular
category
odell
continues
to
impress
me
i
need
to
stop
slacking
and
make
the
hour
journey
to
fort
collins
djust
another
great
brew
from
a
brewery
that
just
contiues
to
impress
me
i
would
pick
this
up
anytime
d
smell
not
all
that
impressive
but
tastes
great
drinkable
too
d
very
well
balanced
which
allows
this
to
be
much
more
drinkable
than
many
of
its
cousins
in
the
english
pale
ale
category
extremely
sessionable
this
one
is
growing
on
me
on
tap
at
the
stable
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
nice
head
retention
and
great
lacing
light
hop
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
by
the
malt
a
perfect
session
beer
lightly
carbonated
and
mild
sweetness
malty
aftertaste
that
does
not
linger
very
smooth
overall
this
is
my
first
odell
offering
and
i
will
def
be
going
back
for
more
d
excellent
drinkability
smooth
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
lower
hop
taste
than
most
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
but
not
bad
either
d
glad
i
have
another
drinkability
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
its
very
well
balanced
and
i
can
drink
it
all
night
long
without
it
getting
old
d
smooth
ez
to
drink
just
makes
for
an
enjoyable
time
d
nice
unassuming
session
beer
that
pairs
well
with
food
i
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
an
amber
brown
with
very
little
head
and
leaves
a
very
small
white
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
as
far
as
the
smell
goes
i
dont
really
get
much
except
some
malty
profiles
and
a
very
faint
sweet
hop
characteristic
this
feels
great
on
the
tongue
medium
body
with
a
light
carbonation
feel
to
it
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
standard
pale
ale
and
if
given
the
chance
id
probably
drink
it
again
although
i
probably
wouldnt
search
for
it
this
is
a
fairly
average
pale
ale
nothing
too
special
going
on
here
kind
of
an
amber
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
subtle
malt
profile
under
a
citrus
hop
presence
the
taste
has
hops
up
front
and
settles
to
some
mild
caramel
malts
the
average
body
is
refreshing
and
has
decent
carbonation
a
good
pale
ale
but
not
the
most
interesting
better
session
beer
than
snpa
in
my
opinion
a
mild
beer
that
would
probably
be
good
as
a
crossover
for
some
d
this
is
a
good
balanced
pale
ale
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
can
have
a
few
but
if
i
want
to
session
with
a
pale
there
are
a
few
others
i
would
go
for
first
interesting
and
even
good
but
nothing
great
it
has
key
characteristics
of
an
english
pale
ale
perhaps
with
an
american
flair
though
a
bit
too
leafytannic
i
reaaly
like
this
beer
i
had
it
today
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
it
is
on
the
darker
side
of
the
pale
ale
spectrum
being
a
bright
red
color
that
is
very
appealing
there
is
a
great
hop
bouquet
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
carries
those
hops
with
it
and
balances
them
with
a
rich
malt
flavor
this
is
a
big
beer
masquerading
as
a
pale
ale
mdheavy
body
and
moderate
carbonation
barely
a
sting
on
the
tongue
quite
nice
drinkability
is
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
balanced
between
the
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
balance
of
malt
and
hops
very
pleasant
but
not
exceptional
mouthfeel
is
lighlty
sticky
and
medium
bodied
another
strong
brew
from
this
brewery
for
me
very
tasty
brew
good
balance
thirst
quenching
and
easy
to
drink
heres
to
someone
making
a
fantastic
session
beer
with
flavor
that
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
without
benig
filled
up
and
buzzin
poured
very
nicely
wonderful
head
wanted
a
bit
more
aroma
but
still
good
generally
smooth
with
a
bit
of
acidity
it
had
a
pretty
good
balance
that
obviously
leaned
toward
hop
heavy
in
a
good
way
i
really
liked
the
color
and
clarity
of
this
beer
i
would
buy
it
again

this
is
a

from
a
great

to

other
beers
i
remember
being
impressed
by
this
beer
when
it
first
came
out
its
orange
with
a
nice
head
and
looks
great
in
a
pint
glass
smells
good
but
i
can
see
why
this
is
english
style
this
is
a
nice
balanced
pale
ale
its
very
easy
to
drink
tasty
i
can
drink
several
of
these
i
should
have
bought

it
doesnt

do
anything

gabf
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
went
very
well
with
the
vegetarian
pizza
it
accompanied
this
isnt
as
hoppy
as
apas
which
is
why
i
think
i
was
critical
at
first
this
beer
has
a
nice
hop
aroma
and
taste
in
good
balance
with
the
malts
and
it
was
very
refreshing
a
nice
alternative
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
the
hoppiness
of
an
apa
im
becoming
a
fan
of
odells
not
a
bad
beer
really
just
pretty
mediocre
the
beer
pours
a
medium
caramel
with
a
dense
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
just
about
perfect
for
me
especially
in
a
pale
ale
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
along
with
some
solid
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
good
but
not
quite
the
same
as
the
smell
there
is
the
classic
pale
ale
taste
backed
up
with
a
little
stronger
hop
profile
i
tasted
grass
pine
and
a
little
chocolate
the
carbonation
and
body
of
the
beer
make
it
a
beer
for
all
seasons
with
just
the
right
mix
of
body
and
liveliness
this
is
a
superdrinkable
beer
it
just
goes
down
smooth
i
think
this
would
be
one
of
my
standards
if
i
could
get
it
in
atlanta
unfortunately
we
cant
so
i
will
just
need
to
visit
colorado
more
often
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
medium
copper
color
with
lots
of
big
bubbly
white
head
aromas
are
pretty
hop
forward
fuggle
and
ekgs
give
off
a
nice
floral
citrusy
aroma
fresh
some
faint
lightly
toasty
malts
are
there
but
mostly
hops
on
the
palate
the
hops
continue
to
take
center
stage
with
a
nice
open
of
mango
and
citrus
unfortunately
it
takes
a
weird
turn
from
there
an
increasingly
dry
thin
body
with
biting
carbonation
give
this
one
a
poor
mid
palate
and
finish
overall
drinkability
is
fine
but
id
like
a
better
rounded
pale
ale
this
beer
is
just
short
of
awesome
very
hoppy
and
very
slightly
bitter
i
started
drinking
this
beer
over
the
winter
and
it
works
well
in
all
seasons
it
is
wellbalanced
enough
to
go
well
with
different
foods
especially
fish
give
it
a
try
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
this
could
be
a
session
beer
a
solid
britishstyle
pale
ale
with
perhaps
more
hops
than
the
average
brit
perhaps
not
willing
to
live
on
the
wild
side
of
the
beer
experience
it
certainly
has
better
manners
than
many
of
those
beers
that
do
poured
from

12oz

appears
a
golden

color
with
about
two
fingers

of

of

with

rich

foamy
head
with
many
rifts
in
it
leaves
rings
of
lacing
around
the
glass
with
each
gulp
aroma
could
have
been
a
bit
stronger
smells
like
a
mix
of
american
and
english
pale
ales
it
has
the
diacetyl
but
theres
a
cleanness
to
it
also
the
hops
are
a
mix
of
citrus
and
earthy
herbal
ones

tones
and
a
rather
pronounced

of
mandarin
orange

mouthfeel
almost
leans
toward
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
excellent

this
all
night

medium

subtle

well

drinkability

i
thought

pretty
good
id
have
this
again
flavors
are
solid

is
a

this

has
other

i
find

hops

in
a

zesty
lemon
mild

backbone
and
traces
of
butterscotch

are
found
here
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
session
beverage
d
definately
a
british
style
pale
ale
but
with
quite
a
bit
going
on
this
beer
is
quite
light
and
easy
drinking
i
could
definitely
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
during
a
session
of
course
it
is
light
and
interesting
enough
to
be
used
as
that
beer
that
one
starts
out
the
night
with
before
moving
on
to
more
powerful
beers
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
make
for
a
great
session
it
is
a
lovely
beer
to
look
at
a
really
nice
creamy
thick
head
with
staying
power
it
also
had
a
great
mouthfeel
even
with
the
loads
of
bitterness
d
it
is
a
pretty
good
pa
a
good
blend
of
hops
and
malt
definitely
worth
trying
an
interesting
pale
ale
that
straddles
the
british
and
american
versions
of
the
style
very
drinkable
very
nice
d
this
is
a
really
really
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
a
bit
closer
to
the
british
style
of
pale
ale
than
american
which
is
always
a
plus
for
me
overall
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
like
the
pale
ales
but
cant
drink
a
lot
of
them
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
in
the
head
i
read
that
it
should
be
a
lot
thicker
than
what
i
got
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
sinner
that
i
am
i
could
drink
these
down
like
water
all
day
long
in
the
summer
good
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
the
carbonation
in
check
flavor
lingers
for
a
bit
before
slowly
fading
away
good
drinkabilty
overall
nice
flavor
and
really
easy
to
put
down
a
nice
beer
very
smooth
body
smooth
taste
everything
meshes
well
seamless
slightly
high
carbonation
moderate
malt
moderate
hop
bite
and
a
vanilla
wslight
creaminess
is
there
finishes
with
hop
tartness
and
a
mildly
syrupy
sweetness
overall
very
good
for
an
everyday
beer
you
know
this
would
be
an
absolutely
amazing
esb
if
it
had
different
hops
yeah
its
a
pale
ale
and
whatever
oh
hmm
the
category
here
is
english
pale
ale
well
that
it
aint
there
are
just
too
many
merican
hops
floral
grapfruity
for
this
to
be
english
anything
and
frankly
it
disturbs
me
this
really
would
be
a
great
beer
but
well
bleh
drinkability
sessionable
easydrinking
pale
ale
but
thid
definitely
doesnt
live
up
to
the
we
love
hops
claims
of
the
label
and
i
cant
really
see
how
the
hop
filtering
and
additions
add
to
the
beer
i
think
a
lot
of
drinkers
will
find
this
inoffensive
but
malty
and
lacking
hops
aggression
fruitier
than
other
epas
ive
had
but
not
quite
vibrant
enough
to
be
an
apa
or
an
ipa
as
with
many
odell
beers
this
is
a
linedrive
single
rather
than
a
home
run
a
great
session
beer
this
would
make
very
nicely
crafted
pours
a
copper
colour
with
a
limited
head
citrus
hops
and
malt
on
the
nose
flavors
are
a
hop
winning
battle
with
the
malts
but
i
did
not
find
this
brew
to
be
crazy
hoppy
grapefruit
on
a
apricot
canvas
a
good
pale
ale
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
over
all
i
think
this
is
a
tastey
and
balanced
pale
ale
this
is
the
beer
that
odell
is
replacing
their
bobby
kolsch
with
while
5
barrel
is
good
if
i
had
to
choose
i
think
i
would
prefer
bobby
pours
a
rust
color
with
a
massive
fluffy
ivory
colored
head
that
retains
well
floral
and
biscuity
odors
malts
up
front
with
a
hop
kick
for
the
finish
in
the
mouth
feels
very
good
in
the
mouth
refreshing
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
this
would
be
my
summer
time
session
beer
not
as
hoppy
as
other
pale
ales
but
overall
better
than
most
many
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
sample
with
the
5
2
this
makes
for
a
good
sessional
summer
brew
i
used
to
drink
the
cutthroat
pale
ale
quite
a
bit
this
seems
pretty
comparable
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
ipa
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
the
english
ipas
but
this
beer
is
making
me
think
otherwise
i
could
definitely
go
for
a
few
more
very
nice
pour
with
a
range
of
merigold
hues
good
thick
crown
and
steady
head
retention
a
good
number
of
bubbles
rise
to
the
crown
the
beer
is
somewhat
hazey
and
is
even
moreso
directly
below
the
crown
the
frothy
white
head
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
crown
subsides
good
hoppy
aroma
with
hints
of
citrus
the
beer
has
a
crisp
hoppy
taste
with
some
citrus
and
even
more
bitterness
toward
the
end
however
the
flavor
does
seem
to
fade
or
dull
too
quickly
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
light
and
refreshing
good
drinkability
appears
an
orange
copper
hue
nice
sized
off
white
head
leaves
fine
streaks
of
lacing
down
my
pint
aroma
has
citrus
aromatics
biscuit
toned
pale
malts
very
nice
hop
profile
here
taste
has
a
moderate
bitterness
citrus
fruit
zest
bready
pale
malt
balances
very
well
together
very
nice
depth
to
the
simple
straight
forward
pale
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
pale
even
smooth
carbonation
touch
of
oiliness
in
the
texture
drinkability
is
great
such
a
balanced
pale
with
ample
hop
flavor
good
indeed
a
good
drink
near
5
barrels
of
this
stuff
quality
drinkability
do
i
want
another
yes
can
i
get
another
absolutely
a
near
sessionable
beer
if
your
session
is
held
to
a
6pack
imo
and
affordable
i
can
find
this
on
sale
every
couple
of
weeks
for
5
99
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
a
cuthroat
so
i
can
not
compare
them
side
by
side
but
this
one
is
a
little
different
a
very
solid
pale
ale
brewed
with
some
cool
hops
kinda
like
a
tameddown
stone
ipa
me
likey
cheers
drinkablity
is
very
solid
and
a
really
enjoyable
beer
to
sit
and
drink
and
not
have
to
ponder
any
real
intricacies
to
this
one
a
very
enjoyable
pale
it
is
what
is
advertised
to
be
very
nice
embossed
bottle
also
this
is
the
only
beer
to
rival
dfh
60
minute
for
balance
and
flavor
i
have
had
this
year
cheers
to
odell
and
may
the
grow
and
send
some
of
this
beer
to
md

taste
is
a
surprisingly
somewhat
puckering
citrus
hops
hit
upfront
then
balances
out
as
the
malts
do
their
part
but
the
remanants
of
that
start
still
linger
as
i
smack
my
lips

is

is

very
impressive

beer
tried
for
the
first
time
while
in
co
for
the
great
american
beer
festival
odells
creates
some
good
things
definitely
worth
giving
a
shot
a
little
cloudy
in
appearance
but
very
drinkable
id
love
to
give
this
one
a
shot
on
tap
there
is
a
smoothness
to
the
beer
as
pleasant
kind
of
surprising
for
its
limited
taste
a
good
carbonation
that
isnt
too
much
or
too
little
overall
this
is
a
decent

in

5
barrel
pale

is
a
decent
english
pale

that
needs
to
undergo
a
change
in
the
malt
bill
if
im
ever
to
get
fully
onboard
as
always
your
mileage
may
vary
thanks
to
bditty187
for
the
bottle
sampled
at
the
taproom
in
fort
collins
poured
a
light
amber
color
slight
carbonation
and
head
with
lacing
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
good
earthfloral
smell
of
hops
taste
is
very
well
balanced
slightly
malty
with
a
nice
hop
aftertaste
very
good
pale
ale
i
liked
it
on
draft
more
so
but
failed
to
take
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
and
soft
easy
to
drink
i
could
session
this
poured
very
nicely
wonderful
head
wanted
a
bit
more
aroma
but
still
good
generally
smooth
with
a
bit
of
acidity
it
had
a
pretty
good
balance
that
obviously
leaned
toward
hop
heavy
in
a
good
way
i
really
liked
the
color
and
clarity
of
this
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
this
beer
pours
perfect
with
a
nearly
two
fingers
head
that
stays
with
the
glass
throughout
the
session
i
was
most
impressed
with
the
look
of
this
beer
the
smell
is
slightly
citrus
to
me
with
a
more
overwhelming
hop
and
malt
overtone
this
beer
tasted
as
advertised
for
a
pale
ale
slightly
hopped
with
a
nice
smooth
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
decent
but
the
last
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
amongst
freinds
yesterday
i
toured
the
odell
brewery
with
brewmasterowner
doug
odell
personally
doing
the
honors
if
you
get
to
fort
collins
it
is
worth
your
time
a
beautifully
set
up
organized
and
wellrun
first
class
operation
bins
full
of
imported
english
malts
a
huge
variety
of
hops
and
all
the
bells
and
whistles
they
have
5
barrel
on
tap
in
both
nitro
and
carbonated
forms
so
i
had
a
growler
to
go
i
liked
the
creaminess
of
the
nitro
but
knowing
it
would
go
flat
had
a
mixture
poured
into
my
jug
it
travelled
will
and
still
has
plenty
of
fizz
it
was
worth
the
drive
there
are
a
halfdozen
hops
that
go
into
the
process
of
making
this
beer
willamette
being
the
most
prominent
i
tasted
it
green
right
out
of
the
yeast
tank
even
then
it
was
delicious
but
the
nitro
version
is
so
creamy
smooth
but
it
has
all
the
apricotpeach
aromas
delicate
hops
perfect
fizz
medium
malt
middle
and
dry
elegant
finish
of
the
bottled
tap
nitro
and
growler
versions
were
perfect
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
an
intense
hop
aroma
that
is
floral
and
pleasant
to
the
nose
it
also
has
a
solid
malt
base
that
consists
of
pale
and
carapils
malts
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
well
balanced
flavor
it
has
a
nice
malty
core
that
boasts
of
pale
and
carapils
malts
as
well
as
a
very
bitter
hop
taste
and
finish
thats
floral
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
it
has
awesome
aroma
and
taste
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
overall
impression
great
session
beer
as
i
said
in
my
on
tap
review
this
is
a
bit
like
a
hopped
up
version
of
fat
tire
an
all
around
good
but
average
pale
this
will
be
bottled
in
june
of
this
year2005
im
glad
it
is
replacing
the
current
cutthroat
pale
it
had
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
some
what
small
head
nothing
too
out
there
about
it
one
of
the
better
local
pales
on
tap
i
would
take
it
over
the
new
belgium
products
overall
its
a
good
mild
american
pale
ale
the
american
hops
differentiate
it
quite
a
bit
from
the
english
hops
in
the
cutthroat
pale
i
like
the
dry
hopped
flavor
i
wish
it
was
even
hoppier
medium
auburn
12
with
off
white
foam
a
whisper
of
floral
notes
lite
floral
flavor
and
lite
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
remembered
this
differently
or
my
tastes
have
changed
but
i
think
several
years
ago
this
tasted
more
dynamic
than
the
6
pack
i
just
finished
from
merrimack
nh
havent
had
it
in
so
long
i
thought
id
try
it
out
rather
than
all
the
crafts
ive
been
drinking
i
do
understand
where
the
76
okay
score
stands
with
this
one
as
it
was
just
that
by
the
way
according
to
my
bottle
it
appears
this
beer
has
5
1
alcohol
not
the
5
0
given
on
this
site
not
sure
if
its
a
mistake
or
just
a
modification
to
the
brew
thats
been
made
my
guess
is
the
latter
12
oz
bottle
copper
color
thin
head
with
short
retention
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
flavor
of
bread
caramel
and
vanilla
slightly
sweet
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
light
to
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
it
could
be
a
tad
less
sweet
and
more
complex
but
in
limited
circumstances
it
holds
its
own
an
enjoyable
pale
ale
overall
i
liked
this
i
think
that
it
is
better
than
what
most
people
here
give
it
credit
for
of
course
its
not
the
best
but
it
is
a
pleasant
session
beer
always
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
always
a
classic
i
was
sad
to
see
this
get
such
low
marks
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
for
quite
sometime
and
it
though
i
wont
buy
it
all
that
much
will
never
leave
my
rotation
it
has
a
very
understated
but
refined
taste
that
i
find
very
comforting
the
original
pale
ale
before
the
revolution
sam
shackleton
a
classic
beer
that
doesnt
get
its
due
this
is
my
standard
for
pale
ales
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
i
am
more
of
an
ale
person
so
am
guessing
ale
lovers
enjoy
this
one
more
then
others
based
on
the
other
ratings
i
have
read
good
easy
drinking
middle
of
the
road
beer
not
to
bad
lacking
a
little
on
flavor
for
me
very
bland
not
much
taste
to
it
not
unpleasant
but
not
the
sort
of
beer
i
could
really
enjoy
simple
beer
for
simple
times
a
decent
pale
ale
that
highlights

metallic

is

hidden
with
zero

of

overall
this
is
a
very
solid
english
pale
ale
all
around
good
balance
and
robustness
of
darkbready
malt
earthy
hops
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
reviewing
the
us
version
of
this
beer
not
going
to
waste
much
on
this
any
reference
to
bass
or
the
red
triangle
need
to
be
removed
this
is
not
the
bass
you
remember
or
like
its
just
another
generic
american
beer
dont
bother
bass
pale
ale
i
somehow
always
get
lucky
when
on
travel
for
work
and
try
something
that
always
impresses
me
this
time
it
was
a
bass
pale
ale
by
far
the
smoothest
pale
ale
i
have
had
it
tasted
more
like
a
dark
lager
than
a
pale
ale
surprising
and
refreshing
to
me
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
smell
and
it
had
a
fastdisappearing
head
with
no
lacing
but
the
taste
was
exceptional
i
would
definitely
reach
for
this
guy
if
it
shows
up
in
my
local
liquor
joint
my
grandad
used
to
drink
this
and
said
that
it
was
outstanding

5although

body
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
more
flavorful
lager
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
as
how
drinkable
it
was
very
balanced
this
beer
delivers
what
you
should
expect
from
one
of
those
beers
that
is
a
step
up
from
the
unmentionables
it
is
serviceble
and
nice
to
have
around
less
generic
taste
but
still
satisfying
tickle
to
my
tongue
and
palate
this
ale
is
very
refreshing
and
provides
a
very
good
flavor
decent
price
and
miscellaneous
greens
the
body
is
light
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
too
bitter
about
this
beer
i
feel
as
if
most
imports
are
overpriced
but
the
taste
was
just
not
there
im
sorry
but
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
who
knows
maybe
ill
give
another
chance
in
the

i

assuming
one
didnt
have

the
fact

it

overall
im
really
not

what
the
fuss
is
all
about
it
lacks
flavor
all
around
except
for
the
bitter
taste
of
alcohol
and
tannins
at
the
end
not
a
good
pale
ale
i
can
think
of
dozens
better
the
taste
was
good
slightly
bitter
but
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
sweet
lets
keep
our
fingers
crossed
that
the
beer
were
brewing
comes
out
just
as
good
its
pale
smells
like
beer
tastes
like
beer
with
a
tiny
jibble
of
hops
more
malt
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
epitomy
of
an
ok
beer
back
in
1994
this
was
a
great
beer
why
i
drank
so
many
whiskey
sours
because
beer
was
ok
not
great
thank
goodness
for
the
beer
revolution
d
overall
not
much
flavor
but
balanced
and
easy
to
quaff
d
fairly
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
fallback
for
when
the
selection
isnt
very
promising
however
now
that
ba
has
enlightened
me
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
as
a
premium
beer
any
longer
first
time
from
a
can
pours
amber
with
a
modest
head
and
few
lacings
aroma
is
mild
floral
hops
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
very
well
balanced
carbonation
is
minimal
as
is
typical
of
english
beers
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
medium
dry
bitter
finish
very
sessionable
if
you
like
this
type
of
beer
and
i
do
a
very
nice
alternative
to
an
american
macro
done
imperial
pint
down
i
think
i
might
need
a
breather
before
2
overall
a
decent
beer
its
a
fine
session
beer
but
nothing
over
the
top
d
low
alcohol
and
a
nice
malt
base
make
for
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
wont
be
ordering
another
pint
feels
light
very
slightly
clingy
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
no
longer
a
favorite
given
its
reputation
i
was
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
was
ok
but
there
are
much
better
pales
out
there
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
d
classic
english
pale
ale
i
can
always
drink
a
bass
easy
to
drink
not
complicated
at
all
definitely
a
good
beer
to
have
at
a
pub
after
work
a
quickly
dissipating
when
poured
into
a
glass
no
lacing
at
all
the
taste
was
a
little
metallic
and
had
hints
of
caramel
mouthfeel
was
about
what
i
expected
it
to
be
pretty
average
carbonation
the
thing
i
couldnt
shake
was
the
after
taste
of
alcohol
it
was
quite
strong
and
ruined
the
beer
for
me
color
was
a
light
red
not
an
outstanding
brew
in
my
opinion
probably
wont
try
this
brew
again
except
to
try
their
famous
black
and
tan
not
much
of
a
head
when
poured
and
head
didnt
hang
around
very
long
no
lacing
ale
was
kind
of
reddish
yellow
in
color
had
a
slight
caramel
smell
with
hints
of
alcohol
actually
very
light
smelling
tasted
very
mild
also
i
didnt
think
there
was
much
hops
going
on
here
tasted
a
little
of
alcohol
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
felt
light
in
the
mouth
i
may
of
had
my
hopes
to
high
on
this
one
i
felt
a
little
disapointed
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
pretty
drinkable
because
its
mellow
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
my
first
english
pale
ale
and
im
not
really
impressed
american
pales
ive
had
were
much
better
however
this
bottle
got
hot
in
my
car
for
a
few
hours
and
that
could
have
messed
it
up
i
will
rerate
it
if
i
have
a
better
experience
next
time
this
is
better
then
i
remembered
it
to
be
a
nice
english
pale
ale
very
drinkable
nothing
amazing
just
a
decent
beer
that
is
always
a
crowd
pleaser
from
the
old
geezers
to
the
young
bucks
decent
not
a
bad
little
brew
at
all
i
liked
it
and
will
have
it
again
drinkability
pretty
high
this
reminds
me
of
a
subdued
sam
smiths
old
brewery
pale
ale
and
given
the
price
and
availability
i
think
itll
be
one
i
go
to
now
and
then
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
good
definitely
could
have
a
session
of
these
beer
has
a
decent
heft
to
it
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
nothing
offensive
here
an
easy
drinker
but
with
more
flavor
than
your
typical
macro
but
also
nothing
overly
distinguishing
high
clarity
ambergold
initial
one
finger
head
that
fades
after
the
first
sip
some
lace
and
light
skim
on
the
surface
first
whiff
caught
an
estery
hint
bit
after
that
it
faded
leaving
faint
traces
of
inoffensive
english
malt
very
slight
hop
bite
hard
to
tell
if
its
hops
or
astringency
soft
malt
flavor
a
touch
nutty
light
bodied
ale
the
quaff
factor
is
its
strong
suit
hopefully
this
will
make
a
nice
black
tan
this
is
one
to
try
but
not
from
a
can
on
tap
its
good
definitely
drinkable
definitely
a
good
session
beer
i
must
admit
i
came
into
this
thinking
this
would
be
just
another
average
beer
but
i
actually
enjoyed
it
sure
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
taste
and
its
extremely
simple
but
if
i
wanted
a
bigger
tastier
beer
i
wouldnt
have
reached
for
this
one
i
did
and
it
gave
me
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
a
solid
simple
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
be
buying
again
im
drinking
this
as
i
type
on
my
iphone
in
lax
what
can
you
say
about
this
old
standby
its
mild
good
flavor
nothing
super
memorable
basically
has
anyone
in
the
history
of
beer
drank
this
and
said
man
this
sucks
i
doubt
it
its
what
every
macro
should
aspire
to
its
also
quite
pretty
great
color
and
head
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
nothing
like
having
it
on
cask
but
still
good
from
the
bottle
drinkability
is
very
good
with
low
alcohol
and
a
dry
finish
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
one
more
sip
appearance
is
a
dark
golden
amber
with
a
fair
head
and
no
lace
smell
has
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
dark
fruitiness
taste
has
a
sharp
bite
of
malt
with
a
light
dull
metallic
taste
mouthfeel
has
good
body
and
carbonation
makes
for
an
easy
enough
session
but
not
one
i
would
specifically
look
for
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
a
little
over
priced
d
not
amazing
a
good
example
of
the
style
certainly
deserves
the
respect
it
gets
around
the
world
drinkability
its
one
that
has
good
qualities
but
id
pass
on
to
a
better
product
if
available
d
pretty
good
session
beer
nothing
really
jumps
out
but
a
decent
brew
overall
this
is
a
goto
beer
for
good
flavor
and
exceptional
drinkability
youve
probably
been
living
under
a
rock
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
going
out
and
buying
some
this
beer
pours
a
medium
dark
amber
colour
with
a
small
amount
of
wispy
white
head
the
smell
is
light
and
floral
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
caramel
malt
a
little
muted
british
hops
and
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
leading
to
an
off
dry
finish
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
but
its
still
a
very
drinkable
pub
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
amber
colored
clear
with
a
small
beige
head
of
tight
bubbles
aroma
is
light
of
buttery
toffee
and
earthyfloral
hops
taste
is
smooth
clean
malt
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
hop
flavor
coming
through
light
easy
drinking
balanced
without
being
offensive
to
the
palate
overall
i
have
t
o
say
i
was
not
as
impressed
by
this
one
as
i
thought
i
would
be
as
i
had
heard
some
good
things
about
this
beer
not
something
i
personally
would
be
out
looking
for
again
dont
drink
and
review
comments
not
very
strong
carbonation
especially
since
the
pour
showed
a
lot
of
carbonation
taste
was
a
little
harsh
and
bitter
at
first
but
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
the
taste
was
mellower
and
sweeter
may
have
been
temp
bill
drinkability
is
high
very
refreshing
beer
obviously
a
classic
if
napolean
and
manet
liked
bass
its
gotta
be
good
right
lol
overall
impression
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
wanted
something
light
to
drink
with
pub
food
or
if
i
was
raking
leaves
in
the
fall
its
thirst
quenching
pleasant
and
actually
has
a
bit
more
character
than
some
other
pub
ales
ive
tried
its
not
going
to
wow
you
with
character
complexity
or
strength
but
then
again
i
dont
think
thats
the
goal
of
pub
ales
instead
drink
this
beer
if
you
want
to
toss
quite
a
few
back
and
have
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
only
wish
i
could
get
it
with
a
nitro
widget
to
add
to
the
experience
no
real
head
on
the
pour
but
i
have
a
lingering
foam
over
the
body
soapy
looking
bubbles
around
the
ring
and
a
cloud
over
the
center
of
the
body
where
the
engraved
d
is
working
with
the
carbonation
clear
amber
body
with
carbonation
flowing
through
it
smell
is
slightly
sweet
and
a
ting
of
hoppiness
is
there
carbonation
is
the
first
thing
i
taste
then
a
slight
sweetness
soda
characteristics
first
brew
of
the
night
and
the
hops
arent
coming
out
for
me
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
really
appealingfull
flavor
in
it
i
will
save
the
rest
for
after
i
finish
some
palette
destroying
brews
interesting
to
go
back
and
look
at
something
youve
only
had
when
you
started
drinking
years
ago
lacing
on
the
glass
lingers
for
a
while
before
joining
the
rest
a
decent
starter
epa
for
someone
just
getting
into
beers
not
too
heavy
quite
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
and
it
is
not
incredibly
delicious
d
i
like
epas
a
lot
but
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
the
style
smell
is
primarily
of
orange
and
caramel
malts
clean
and
rather
unvarying
and
with
some
intermingled
hops
evident
upon
agitation
taste
of
caramel
follows
seamlessly
from
the
nose
and
finishes
smoothly
unvarying
as
was
the
nose
the
flavor
is
decent
and
is
followed
by
a
lingering
light
bitterness
less
bitter
than
i
recall
on
tap
and
with
a
touch
less
body
making
for
and
easy
drinking
ale
though
i
think
the
sweetness
would
become
an
issue
in
time
and
the
carbonation
doesnt
keep
a
stronghold
long
enough
for
the
pour
d
medium
drinkability
i
am
still
trying
to
give
this
beer
a
chance
since
i
like
the
style
a
lot
i
will
try
to
understand
its
nature
before
i
condemned
it
i
am
not
sure
that
i
will
buy
a
12
pack
again
overall
a
very
solid
epa
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
this
most
recent
tasting
i
really
didnt
taste
much
honestly
for
a
pale
ale
even
an
english
pale
ale
i
couldnt
detect
much
hop
flavor
sidebyside
it
tasted
uncomfortably
like
my
mothers
mgd
with
the
added
mineraly
flavors
just
not
impressed

i
always
enjoy
hearing
what
people
say
about
bass
ale
its
been
a
long
time
favorite
of
mine
and
every
steak
dinner
i
have
is
always
with
a
bass
ale
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
an
clear
amber
with
an
attractive
head
the
smell
was
sweet
with
some
herbal
notes
the
beer
is
smooth
and
clean
a
slight
bitternes
from
the
hops
is
the
predominant
flavor
and
it
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
imo
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
the
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
goes
well
with
most
foods
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
a
14
inch
head
only
slight
retention
and
very
little
lacing
smells
of
a
sweet
malt
and
hops
a
decent
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
tastes
of
hops
with
an
earthy
flavor
the
malts
are
sweet
and
leave
a
dryness
on
the
tongue
overall
a
sweet
flavor
followed
with
the
bitterness
of
hops
and
a
little
dryness
after
a
couple
you
can
feel
the
warmth
due
t
the
strength
of
these
worth
a
try
if
you
have
one
available
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
pours
clear
amber
with
a
2finger
offwhite
head
caramel
and
bread
aroma
but
kind
of
sour
acidic
bite
to
the
relatively
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
almost
as
if
the
crystal
malt
got
outofwhack
used
to
drink
more
of
this
but
the
hangover
is
a
real
bitch
flavor
is
malty
lightly
toasted
and
a
touch
sweet
with
a
soft
fruitiness
and
a
little
balancing
hop
in
the
finish
nothing
off
or
offensive
nothing
spectacular
just
an
all
around
solid
beer
drinkability
is
high
though
the
sweetness
compounds
slightly
after
3
or
4
which
can
have
you
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
hoppy
great
appearance
and
decent
overall
atmosphere
good
solid
flavor
i
havent
had
a
bass
in
quite
some
time
but
the
taste
is
unique
i
suppose
this
is
an
iconic
beer
or
at
least
solid
drink
its
a
session
beer
not
a
ton
of
character
but
what
there
is
is
very
pleasant
not
bad
at
all
much
to
my
surprise
its
actually
a
pretty
well
made
english
style
pale
ale
an
okay
beer
there
are
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
d
bass
is
one
of
the
beers
that
proved
to
me
that
beer
can
actually
have
taste
even
though
it
seems
lighter
now
than
it
did
a
few
years
ago
this
is
still
a
well
made
mass
produced
easy
to
get
just
about
anywhere
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
drain
the
wallet
o
decent
better
than
most
macro
offerings
comprable
for
me
in
bottle
form
to
michelobs
new
beers
had
this
at
a
work
function
nothing
else
to
choose
from
and
we
all
know
that
drinking
makes
it
easier
to
be
with
people
from
work
away
from
work
not
much
i
can
really
say
that
100s
of
other
people
have
already
siad
poured
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
larger
sized
off
white
head
nondescript
aroams
sweet
malty
tasting
light
in
the
mouth
very
easy
to
drink
and
much
enjoyment
has
been
had
with
this
beer
in
my
hands
d
very
drinkable
not
a
heavy
ale
by
any
means
d
not
much
going
on
very
easy
to
drink
body
pours
an
amber
brown
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
palate
has
a
pale
dryness
to
it
not
much
flavor
but
doesnt
have
an
aftertaste
either
might
be
a
little
flat
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
very
tasty
with
a
flavor
that
is
very
unique
the
taste
is
probably
one
that
you
like
or
dont
like
but
its
different
i
bought
this
to
make
make
black
and
tansmy
quickie
mart
was
out
of
smithwicks
and
harpsso
i
figured
lets
try
it
and
see
how
it
tastes
all
by
itself
i
will
probably
buy
more
of
this
in
the
future
when
i
saw
it
is
a
pale
ale
i
thought
there
would
be
more
hops
coming
through
on
the
finish
but
i
was
disappointed
still
a
good
beer
and
i
will
drink
another
d
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
a
heavy
ale
but
a
lighter
bodied
quality
ale
that
is
easy
to
take
down
in
large
quantities
not
bad
drinkability
nothing
remarkable
or
terrible
about
this
beer
pours
an
amber
with
a
white
head
that
last
a
good
while
it
looks
good
but
the
taste
is
where
it
goes
horribly
wrong
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
with
a
nasty
metallic
aftertaste
its
bitter
but
not
a
hoppy
taste
almost
artificialchemical
taste
i
do
not
recommend
this
beerrun
forrest
run
away
from
this
one
this
beer
is
a
mass
produced
english
pale
ale
that
is
decent
but
lacking
all
complexity
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
decent
head
no
lacing
this
beer
is
plenty
carbonated
the
aroma
is
definitely
earthy
caramel
malt
slightly
musty
this
is
a
dry
beer
quite
light
quite
drinkable
because
of
its
low
abv
the
taste
is
earthy
malts
some
light
caramels
diaceytl
and
buttery
but
not
cloyingly
so
what
you
get
on
the
front
end
is
how
the
beer
finishes
there
isnt
much
complexity
to
the
beer
not
much
to
say
because
it
doesnt
have
loads
of
character
either
but
it
is
drinkable
pours
a
reddish
orange
body
with
a
thick
crisp
white
headclassic
ale
body
nice
misty
lacing
as
glass
drains
toffee
malt
and
some
metallic
pilsner
hints
hops
are
mellow
if
not
subtle
carbonated
mediumbodied
ale
that
settles
the
mouth
more
like
a
lager
quite
drinkable
but
somewhat
slick
malty
caramel
tones
with
toffeesmooth
but
neither
buttery
nutty
or
hoppyhmmmm
as
a
massproduced
ale
bass
holds
its
own
and
is
still
a
pleasant
choice
especially
when
considering
its
availability
at
most
drinking
establishments
and
even
some
house
parties
consistent
and
familiar
there
be
pirates
after
that
beer
it
is
cool
that
this
now
available
in
bc
in
cans
as
i
dig
decent
imports
in
tall
cans
this
has
always
been
a
pretty
beer
to
look
at
with
its
tall
head
and
dark
tan
body
the
nose
is
biscuity
and
kinda
malty
the
taste
is
very
soft
but
tasty
with
flowery
hop
notes
and
a
nice
malty
finish
a
classic
beer
that
is
still
nice
to
drink
especially
in
a
can
where
the
beer
tastes
fresher
d4

i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
but
i
really
dig
bass
epa
and
it
is
always
around
if
you
need
something
familiar
i
can
always
count
on
bass
epa
for
a
drinkable
session
beer
overall
a
very
well
put
together
pale
ale
one
of
the
classics
while
it
isnt
remarkable
or
surprisingly
different
it
is
always
delicious
easy
drinking
and
nonoffensive
which
is
what
i
think
the
brewers
are
going
for
if
the
abv
was
a
little
less
this
would
be
an
even
better
session
ale
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
already
but
its
at
the
highend
another
plus
is
you
can
find
it
in
most
places
for
not
too
bad
a
price
check
it
out
if
you
havent
d
drinks
good
on
tap
at
99
bottles
in
santa
cruz
light
caramel
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
gobs
of
lacing
aroma
is
modest
with
overripe
dark
fruits
and
toasted
malt
flavor
is
very
similar
light
and
tart
dark
fruits
sweetbread
malt
earthy
english
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
luscious
but
this
comes
at
the
expense
of
adequate
carbonation
also
the
flavor
is
not
robust
enough
to
match
the
body
decent
and
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
the
taste
is
bnot
great
but
pretty
good
it
is
mildly
toasty
leafycaramelly
and
leafy
fruity
mostly
plums
and
raisins
with
grain
and
a
faint
vanilla
hint
light
buttery
quality
and
feel
then
a
light
leafy
bitterness
and
some
mineral
the
flavours
are
overall
pleasant
and
its
fairly
well
balanced
however
its
flavours
are
a
bit
on
the
subdued
side
it
has
a
definite
thin
mineralwater
quality
flatness
in
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
is
lightly
acrid
it
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
likes
of
abbot
ale
in
terms
of
basic
character
but
more
muted
less
flavourful
less
interesting
thinner
and
rougher
with
food
it
often
tends
to
degrade
becoming
more
roughly
alcoholic
with
little
flavour
but
thin
acrid
leaves
alone
or
with
certain
foods
though
it
is
pretty
good
pretty
much
a
standard
english
pale
ive
had
plenty
of
times
before
especially
ontap
where
the
options
are
limited
surprised
i
havent
reviewed
much
earlier
there
is
something
staleish
that
i
continually
notice
that
aside
its
not
bad
and
it
almost
has
a
maltiness
and
light
hop
touch
that
make
it
stand
out
but
theres
also
something
an
appley
and
buttery
quality
and
a
general
staleishnessblandishness
that
would
make
me
want
to
pick
other
english
pales
over
this
still
a
decent
brew
if
youre
caught
in
a
limited
option
scenario
considering
how
much
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
versus
the
american
macros
its
a
bit
of
a
letdown
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
an
ok
profile
but
it
doesnt
beg
to
be
consumed
over
and
over
still
better
than
anything
from
the
big
three
drinkability
really
a
pale
ale
better
than
most
cheap
beers
and
thats
about
it
drinkability
the
thumb
points
down
painfully
bland
and
generic
this
poured
a
clear
amber
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
caramel
malt
lemon
hops
cultured
yeast
and
a
bit
of
mulled
spice
it
tasted
like
very
sweet
caramel
and
earthy
brown
sugar
malts
with
slight
grassy
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
good
mass
production
beer
its
reasonably
clean
and
very
drinkable
i
actually
enjoy
the
malty
flavor
quite
a
bit
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
the
best
english
style
pale
ale
for
sure
its
wide
avalability
makes
it
unavoidable
just
had
a
can
of
the
pub
pour
version
and
it
is
noticibly
better
maltier
and
smoother
better
british
hop
style
fairly
good
beer
very
nice
fluffy
full
frothy
head
and
plenty
of
lace
the
bitterness
is
perfectly
balance
with
the
malt
this
is
definitely
better
than
the
orignal
bass
moouthfeel
was
moderate
in
carbonation
with
some
slickness
d
sure
not
often
but
if
its
all
you
got
ill
drink
it
overall
pretty
decent
and
cheap
would
definitely
have
this
again
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
way
too
sweet
and
lacking
the
bitter
flavor
to
impress
against
other
pale
ales
but
a
step
up
from
the
macro
lagers
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
aroma
was
nutty
grainy
from
the
malts
a
bit
of
dough
and
light
pine
from
the
hops
maybe
some
fruit
apple
flavor
was
sweet
initially
but
finished
bitter
decent
session
beer
d
very
high
i
could
drink
many
of
these
the
beer
poured
with
a
crisp
clear
pure
amber
appearance
thick
head
with
some
good
lacing
on
the
sides
aromas
had
a
metallic
mix
of
hops
and
malts
very
florallike
aromas
taste
had
a
bittersweet
doughy
aspect
lots
of
malts
and
hops
but
they
are
a
little
imbalanced
the
mouthfeel
helps
make
the
texture
smooth
and
silky
overall
pretty
darn
good
easy
drinkability
goes
well
with
food
this
was
a
solid
brew
that
was
a
bit
on
the
caramel
side
i
could
drink
these
in
a
session
very
easilly
and
ill
definately
be
getting
more
since
their
widely
available
this
is
a
pretty
nice
easily
obtainable
beer
one
that
has
been
in
the
past
and
easily
could
be
a
session
choice
for
me
pours
an
dark
orange
color
topped
with
a
moderate
head
and
a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
i
prefer
it
out
of
the
bottle
vs
on
draft
but
both
are
good
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
with
some
fruits
an
extremely
clean
finish
smooth
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
i
get
often
when
out
and
not
much
is
on
the
menu
orangeamber
color
with
a
beige
cap
nice
retention
and
good
lacing
unusual
nose
and
slightly
musty
like
old
wood
but
hops
do
emerge
good
mouthfeel
and
quite
smooth
well
balanced
hops
and
malt
without
being
notably
one
or
the
other
though
it
does
slide
as
the
aroma
suggests
towards
hops
some
hazelnut
hints
medium
body
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
clean
finish
d
a
little
better
than
average
im
a
simple
beer
drinker
and
this
is
much
more
complex
than
my
usual
fair
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
wont
come
back
again
a
drinker
by
far
you
can
hit
these
pretty
hard
and
not
get
sick
o
them
on
tap
is
superior
but
the
bottle
stands
up
fine
drinkabilty
for
me
is
good
im
going
to
grab
a
6er
of
this
this
weekend
and
enjoy
it
camping
for
reference
i
had
this
with
a
dinner
of
grilled
chicken
pickles
and
home
made
french
fries
outstanding
overall
decent
yet
uninspiring
drinkability
is
moderate
this
beer
has
decent
flavor
and
is
easily
sessionable
d
drinkiability
would
be
higher
if
it
tasted
better
simply
not
as
good
as
i
remember
mfd
the
creamy
taste
makes
this
thin
to
medium
body
ale
seem
a
bit
fuller
good
session
ale
i
just
wish
the
flavor
was
as
big
as
the
aroma
d
easy
drinking
a
fairly
mindless
affair
but
the
sweetness
deters
after
a
few
d
ive
always
enjoyed
this
beer
in
bars
as
long
as
the
beer
lines
are
clean
otherwise
it
can
lead
to
some
interesting
tastes
the
hard
water
used
in
this
beer
gives
it
an
interesting
taste
this
is
a
very
good
cant
loose
ale
everytime
i
have
one
i
really
enjoy
it
pours
a
nice
copperamber
color
with
a
really
good
soft
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
gentle
going
down
the
hatch
with
a
nice
finish
the
taste
is
very
good
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
some
bittering
hops
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
with
dinner
it
goes
with
most
dishes
and
it
easily
available
pleasant
aroma
of
caramelized
malts
some
earthy
notes
attrcative
appearance
a
reddish
orange
with
a
moderate
white
head
true
to
the
style
falvor
is
not
remarkable
but
is
a
good
balance
between
caramel
malts
and
grassy
hops
the
finish
is
appropraitely
bitter
a
perfectly
acceptable
beer
good
on
the
railroad
home
after
a
long
day
d
sweet
dry
and
malty
with
a
nice
dry
flowery
hopping
thats
just
enough
to
grab
your
attention
makes
this
a
decent
session
pale
respectable
drinkability
d
while
not
necessarily
my
first
choice
for
a
session
beer
bass
is
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
solid
choice
for
sessioning
this
one
pours
an
almost
orange
amber
this
one
reeks
of
malt
and
dosent
disapoint
huge
malty
flavor
followed
by
big
hops
this
one
makes
the
purfict
black
and
tan
it
is
just
a
bit
thiner
than
i
care
for
and
could
use
more
hops
for
my
taste
but
all
and
all
i
love
this
one
very
good
beer
i
remember
a
better
product
and
this
6
pack
was
pulled
out
of
a
case
sitting
on
a
freshly
arrived
pallet
at
the
suppermarket
my
guess
is
it
sat
in
a
warehouse
or
two
before
it
got
to
me
try
and
get
this
product
fresh
it
should
be
better
than
what
i
got
definately
a
solid
ale
id
love
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
had
a
few
of
these
on
tap
this
past
weekend
at
dillons
on
boylston
street
poured
into
imperial
sized
pint
glasses
huge
dark
red
color
no
real
head
only
slight
carbonation
smell
was
of
subdued
hops
i
enjoy
drinking
bass
as
i
think
its
a
quality
beer
with
a
good
flavor
my
only
two
faults
with
it
is
a
weird
almost
thick
aftertaste
i
get
in
my
mouth
afterwards
and
second
its
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
somewhat
hoppy
beer
its
a
good
beer
to
grab
when
the
selection
sucks
but
its
not
one
that
i
go
after
regularly
notes
i
do
not
recall
having
bass
before
this
session
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
bass
is
not
an
advenurous
beer
but
that
is
its
strength
it
is
a
very
good
staple
beer
that
i
think
would
go
very
well
with
a
wide
range
of
food
i
will
certainly
not
hesitate
to
get
this
again
okay
beer
but
i
would
never
have
it
again
nothing
special
d
this
is
my
first
english
pale
ale
is
is
a
lot
less
bitter
than
many
other
pale
ales
this
makes
it
very
drinkable
and
i
love
the
apple
cider
finish
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
im
not
sure
if
i
can
justify
spending
8
00
a
six
on
it
when
there
are
so
many
other
amazing
beers
out
there
in
this
price
range
maybe
when
a
12pack
is
on
sale
overall
not
horrible
but
definitly
not
worth
the
money
serving
type
bottle
d
nice
balanced
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
for
most
a
session
beer
for
certain
i
can
see
why
it
made
its
way
over
here
from
europe
like
mentioned
in
the
heading
of
this
review
if
its
the
restaurants
finest
draught
beer
and
not
guinness
ill
reach
for
it
again
and
again
and
do
whatever
i
can
do
to
avoid
the
usual
suspects
decent
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
definitely
less
hops
than
other
pale
ales
and
more
malt
aroma
was
weak
until
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
when
it
got
stronger
and
very
pleasant
reminded
me
of
caramels
good
smooth
mouthfeel
not
watery
with
a
nice
tingle
definitely
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
beer
with
real
good
flavor
unless
youre
just
drinking
a
pale
ale
for
the
hops
very
mellow
on
flavors
some
light
hops
in
there
a
berry
like
sweetness
it
is
creamy
and
very
fizzy
light
and
drinkable
bass
really
didnt
stand
out
to
me
at
all
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
in
it
this
is
one
of
the
most
beautifully
colored
beers
i
have
ever
seen
a
clear
copperorange
looks
amazing
as
a
black
and
tan
if
i
had
first
tried
this
about
a
month
ago
i
would
have
really
loved
it
and
given
it
a
high
flavor
rating
however
i
have
since
moved
to
the
dark
side
and
am
a
selfproclaimed
hop
head
and
this
brew
is
too
malty
for
me
does
have
a
very
clean
aftertaste
with
hops
to
do
the
cleansing
easy
to
drink
with
a
mellow
sweet
malty
flavor
still
cant
get
over
the
color
md
overall
the
beer
left
me
wanting
a
little
more
from
it
i
was
not
overly
impressed
like
i
had
been
when
i
first
tried
bass
but
it
was
smooth
and
fairly
pleasant
to
drink
this
beer
would
not
be
my
choice
when
at
an
establishment
with
a
better
selection
but
it
is
a
beer
that
i
am
sure
that
i
will
find
myself
ordering
again
what
weve
got
is
a
pretty
fullflavored
ale
that
has
flaws
small
enough
to
overlook
it
seems
bass
ale
is
a
pretty
common
premium
beer
to
be
found
in
a
bar
without
many
craft
beers
so
its
a
good
go
to
beer
when
your
choices
are
limited
to
macrolagers
and
crappy
imports
its
no
chore
to
drink
bass
pale
ale
bottled
beer
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
it
pours
an
amberbrown
color
it
tastes
of
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
slight
fruitedness
in
the
middle
and
finishes
slightly
hop
bitter
with
nice
rough
carbonation
i
usually
like
my
beer
ice
cold
but
i
find
the
flavour
to
borrow
form
the
brits
of
this
one
to
be
better
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
when
it
gets
a
bit
warmer
strange
i
know
a
light
brown
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
nose
is
of
dusty
old
malt
and
straw
the
taste
has
some
very
mild
malts
and
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
the
body
is
medium
and
would
be
nice
if
not
for
the
fizzy
carbonation
nothing
special
just
a
mild
ale
from
jolly
old
england
drinkability
with
an
average
low
abv
and
the
watery
smoothness
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
here
but
the
sweetness
and
diacetyl
is
getting
to
me
d
super
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
poured
a
amber
with
some
orange
to
it
in
color
with
a
thin
head
the
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
leaving
spots
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
slightly
dull
as
some
malt
and
fruitiness
is
detected
the
taste
is
of
malt
and
bitterness
which
is
balanced
some
fruit
tones
are
detectable
the
bitterness
seems
to
arrive
a
little
stronger
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
not
as
flavorful
as
some
other
pales
but
very
drinkable
much
better
on
tap
than
in
bottle
by
far
bass
is
bass
i
actually
like
this
beer
when
i
am
in
certain
moods
or
if
a
pub
or
bar
happens
to
have
the
guinness
on
tap
as
well
as
the
bass
then
i
can
go
for
a
black
and
tan
for
english
beers
there
is
better
but
this
is
just
my
opinion
i
do
think
bass
tastes
better
on
tap
then
in
the
bottle
some
stores
tend
to
keep
bass
on
the
shelves
too
long
and
gets
a
bit
funky
to
my
taste
d
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
i
would
find
myself
bored
with
it
after
a
few
more
not
as
exciting
or
flavorful
as
other
english
brews
d
you
can
do
it
you
can
do
it
all
night
great
session
that
i
need
to
order
more
often
d
for
being
mass
produced
it
tastes
quite
good
a
pale
ale
id
be
happy
to
have
any
time
this
is
a
great
beer
to
come
back
to
after
you
havent
had
one
in
a
while
like
a
relative
who
visits
every
once
in
a
while
its
nice
to
see
them
but
you
dont
want
them
to
overstay
their
welcome
pours
clear
light
reddish
brown
with
14
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
very
mild
smell
of
malt
with
hint
of
sweet
fruity
sugar
nondescript
flavor
that
is
light
bodied
with
crisp
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
that
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
no
bad
flavors
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
either
feels
watery
with
a
sweet
burn
on
the
way
down
milkier
than
expected
soapy
its
disappointing
i
generally
like
bass
on
tap
but
out
of
the
can
it
didnt
hit
the
mark
not
awful
but
subpar
overall
pretty
good
drink
but
not
really
that
great
of
a
pale
ale
if
you
try
it
youll
understand
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
amazing
either
this
one
is
a
good
average
ale
that
should
be
popular
with
snobby
college
kids
that
have
the
money
to
buy
bottled
beer
rather
then
bud
ice
cheers
decent
to
good
brew
but
overpriced
here
in
atlanta
at
14
99
for
a
twelve
pack
nitrotap
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
for
this
beer
the
lack
of
co2
lets
the
subtle
flavors
come
out
and
make
for
a
tasty
almost
casklike
experience
the
aroma
is
a
mellow
mix
of
caramel
and
toffee
grains
the
flavor
expands
on
these
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
and
biscuit
flavors
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
bland
macro
take
on
the
epa
but
this
was
a
tasty
beer
got
it
on
draught
at
carsons
american
bistro
in
ann
arbor
mi
poured
a
dark
hazy
copper
and
had
a
nice
aroma
of
hops
it
felt
mediumbodied
in
the
mouth
and
the
hops
were
pretty
apparent
in
the
taste
but
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pale
its
very
flavorful
without
being
too
strong
to
have
a
few
not
on
my
faves
list
but
not
a
bad
brew
either
my
first
beer
for
st
pattys
day
pours
a
clear
med
gold
color
w
a
decent
white
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
bit
leaving
moderate
lacing
in
my
nonic
not
a
strong
smell
a
sweet
mildly
toasted
malt
aroma
w
some
floral
hop
some
mild
diacetyl
type
yeast
and
alcoholic
undertones
present
a
dry
crisp
malty
flavor
a
bit
nutty
and
crackerlike
but
well
balanced
w
the
hop
bitterness
a
very
faint
dark
fruit
present
as
well
a
good
lightmed
body
yet
drier
than
the
taste
aroma
let
on
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
sweeter
the
co2
was
good
helping
support
that
head
and
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
may
have
to
add
this
one
to
my
sessionable
list
for
sure
d
this
is
the
first
draft
beer
i
have
had
and
its
pretty
decent
i
could
see
this
being
a
draft
staple
d
not
a
particularly
pleasant
brew
and
one
that
i
would
pass
over
for
many
many
others
but
in
a
pinch
it
could
quench
a
thirst
you
can
easily
do
much
much
worse
most
days
im
an
apa
guy
but
every
once
and
a
while
i
like
to
have
an
english
pale
ale
and
usually
this
is
the
one
available
the
beer
arrived
with
a
basic
pale
amber
body
and
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
prominent
buttery
malt
flavor
with
a
good
amount
of
complex
hop
flavor
for
a
mass
produced
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
jumping
off
point
when
youre
exploring
pale
ales
had
this
on
tap
and
it
does
make
a
difference
a
apple
juicelike
color
on
top
of
a
hoppy
applelike
smelling
brew
must
have
had
apples
on
the
brain
in
other
words
a
very
light
alcohol
aroma
gives
a
nice
head
that
leaves
lacing
and
is
complemented
by
a
mediumish
grain
body
that
fills
the
mouth
and
goes
down
very
smooth
not
much
in
the
taste
department
but
one
of
those
beers
where
you
and
a
buddy
split
a
pitcher
and
you
know
youre
drinking
generic
stuff
but
you
dont
care
a
nice
session
beer
that
you
can
relax
with
if
youre
at
a
bar
d
a
great
choice
when
having
a
few
and
nicely
paired
with
most
meals
i
really
enjoy
it
and
will
continue
to
drink
it
if
i
recall
correctly
bass
on
draught
was
much
different
less
carbonated
and
it
was
served
a
bit
warmer
in
this
case
i
prefer
it
chilled
and
out
of
a
bottle
drinkability
good
drinkability
good
with
fish
and
chips
i
found
the
unique
feature
of
this
brew
to
be
in
the
taste
there
is
an
interesting
sweetness
in
the
malt
but
the
finish
tends
to
be
dry
there
also
seems
to
be
something
interesting
in
the
bittering
like
there
is
something
more
or
perhaps
different
than
just
hops
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
session
beer
i
can
think
of
alot
of
things
i
would
rather
have
but
that
cannot
detract
from
the
fact
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
overall
a
very
palatable
beer
d
not
bad
ive
had
this
by
the
sixer
before
it
seems
a
little
bitter
tonight
but
add
a
snack
and
this
beers
drinkablity
is
pretty
nice
d
id
say
pretty
good
maybe
i
should
score
this
higher
its
definitely
sessionable
but
if
you
like
apple
juice
stay
away
from
this
one
youll
be
divorced
and
living
on
the
streets
in
no
time
for
everyone
else
recommended
pours
a
brilliant
amberish
caramel
orange
color
with
creamy
off
white
head
has
a
very
mild
smell
of
maltiness
and
caramel
taste
is
very
smooth
a
bit
malty
with
a
creaminess
great
mouthfeel
somewhat
lightly
flavored
and
is
very
drinkable
quite
good
with
a
subtle
overall
taste
and
aftertaste
a
great
overall
beer
not
bad
for
certain
yet
still
middleoftheroad
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
too
overpowering
to
prevent
consuming
several
of
these
at
one
sitting
notes
nothing
too
special
but
really
sessionable
i
usually
stock
this
as
one
of
my
regular
everyday
fridge
beers
was
served
to
me
in
a
pint
american
pint
not
british
unfortunatly
glass
waaay
too
cold
for
the
style
so
i
slowly
sipped
on
it
until
it
had
a
chance
to
warm
up
a
bit
has
a
clear
amber
color
with
no
head
smells
of
english
malt
taste
is
pretty
good
a
sweet
and
also
biscuity
flavor
with
a
bit
of
butter
too
there
wasnt
much
hop
aroma
or
flavor
but
the
bitterness
levels
were
good
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
levels
were
way
too
high
compared
to
drinking
this
style
of
beer
from
the
cask
however
i
did
stir
the
beer
up
a
bit
and
this
brought
carbonation
down
to
much
better
levels
pretty
drinkable
after
doing
so
my
grandpa
used
to
serve
bass
gravity
dispensed
from
the
cask
in
the
late
1940s
and
while
i
suspect
the
beer
was
much
better
back
then
its
still
worth
a
drink
now
in
its
current
state
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
a
slow
drinking
beer
definatley
smoother
as
it
comes
to
about
5060
degrees
d
pretty
easy
pours
a
nice
amberbrown
color
from
the
bottle
with
a
nice
white
head
with
tints
of
tan
in
it
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
mostly
the
rest
was
a
caramel
fruity
aroma
the
taste
was
good
as
it
delivered
what
it
smelled
like
it
was
really
malty
with
a
kind
of
caramel
taste
at
the
end
it
had
a
good
mouthfeel
and
it
was
very
drinkable
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
its
not
bad
and
its
worth
a
try
d
it
goes
down
quick
and
smooth
probably
one
that
could
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
its
alright
i
bought
this
just
to
rate
it
i
get
it
if
its
on
tap
at
a
subpar
bar
or
the
best
thing
at
the
gas
station
but
ive
certainly
had
better
d
this
is
an
okay
standby
beer
and
i
regularly
drink
it
when
not
many
craft
or
other
interesting
beers
are
available
not
the
one
i
would
choose
if
i
had
several
english
pale
ales
to
choose
from
though
this
is
one
of
my
pub
staples
not
my
favorite
but
a
well
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
that
i
would
recommend
standard
easy
drinking
thats
probably
why
its
had
such
success
here
in
the
states
the
5
0
abv
and
light
taste
make
this
highly
drinkable
if
you
have
not
tried
this
one
please
do
the
price
at
6
99
a
sixpack
is
not
bad
for
an
english
ale
even
though
it
is
mass
produced
overall
despite
the
bitter
flavour
i
sincerely
did
not
like
this
one
there
is
something
there
that
did
not
feel
right
perhaps
i
was
unlucky
with
the
bottle
but
bass
did
not
impress
me
at
all
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
gingerbread
malt
in
the
taste
a
watery
sweet
malt
a
small
bite
in
the
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruitiness
apricot
in
the
aftertaste
a
small
fruit
presence
and
a
small
hop
presence
kind
of
the
standard
pale
very
non
offensive
had
this
on
draft
at
fridays
the
appearance
was
about
average
for
an
ale
like
this
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
decent
not
much
going
on
with
the
aroma
somewhat
bland
and
not
too
appealing
the
taste
was
pretty
good
ive
tried
better
ales
out
there
and
ive
sampled
worse
but
all
in
all
a
good
beer
to
try
and
goes
well
with
appetizers
a
little
bitter
to
my
liking
but
still
drinkable
being
one
of
the
more
popular
imported
english
brews
i
cant
say
i
was
totally
impressed
but
i
wasnt
dissapointed
either
definitely
not
worth
buying
a
sixer
but
a
good
choice
on
tap
during
happy
hour
for
a
2
00
pint
theres
not
enough
depth
to
make
bass
a
true
goto
beer
in
a
pinch
id
say
go
forward
without
hesitation
but
its
nothing
really
special
other
than
being
a
solid
do
everything
beer
with
better
taste
look
elsewhere
for
a
variation
but
this
is
honestly
the
cornerstone
of
english
pale
ales
could
have
drank
several
more
of
these
went
down
way
too
easy
and
the
alcohol
percentage
is
low
almost
a
light
beer
as
far
as
filling
you
up
goes
recommended
if
you
are
at
a
bar
like
i
was
with
nothing
but
bud
or
coors
light
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
of
head
and
high
amount
of
carbonation
has
malty
fruit
and
somewhat
sweet
aromas
taste
is
strong
with
malty
flavors
mouthfeel
is
high
carbonated
but
goes
down
smooth
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
although
not
very
deep
great
head
though
has
a
nice
hoppy
scent
but
not
very
deep
nice
hoppy
taste
and
aftertaste
but
like
its
scent
its
just
not
very
strong
goes
down
fine
above
average
but
not
the
best
still
its
worth
a
try
and
its
easy
to
find
d
a
good
session
beer
available
all
over
the
place
not
a
spectacular
choice
but
it
works
well
in
many
situations
it
could
be
a
poor
batch
that
i
am
rating
this
on
because
i
dont
remember
my
first
bass
tasting
like
this
one
but
it
has
a
rather
skunky
odor
to
it
almost
as
though
it
were
made
with
actual
bass
as
crazy
as
that
sounds
but
the
taste
was
fine
mild
malts
and
hops
very
dark
brown
color
and
a
bitter
finish
i
dont
drink
bass
often
but
i
do
pick
it
up
on
occasion
to
make
some
kickass
black
tans
overall
its
what
youd
expect
of
a
pale
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
disappointing
either
i
dont
know
what
happened
tonight
but
i
feel
like
i
have
rediscovered
this
beer
it
poured
a
nice
brown
amberish
color
and
tasted
pretty
damn
good
i
have
recently
quit
smoking
and
seemed
to
have
gained
a
new
taste
for
beer
i
would
definately
have
to
say
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
a
very
british
treat
pours
a
sparkling
redblonde
lots
of
little
bubbles
and
a
thick
cidery
head
cidery
is
what
really
describes
this
beer
as
you
drink
the
carbonation
sparkles
all
over
your
tongue
as
your
mouth
is
awash
with
appley
and
malty
flavors
theres
a
bit
of
a
woody
finish
to
it
and
then
a
long
lingering
apple
cidery
after
a
very
relaxing
warmer
on
a
chilly
fall
evening

being
one
of
my
first
non
macro
brews
there
will
always
be
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
bass
or
underneath
my
guiness
drinkability
classic
taste
one
of
my
long
time
favorites
very
consistent
it
is
a
very
solid
allaround
beer
nothing
amazing
but
everything
done
well
i
remember
drinking
a
lot
of
this
and
enjoying
it
five
or
six
years
ago
before
i
really
got
into
craft
beer
i
had
a
pint
of
this
at
some
restaurant
dont
remember
which
one
in
new
jersey
and
was
disappointed
with
how
badly
it
fared
compared
to
what
else
is
out
there
nothing
distinctly
wrong
with
it
although
there
was
a
mild
cooked
corn
note
to
the
aroma
and
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
high
for
an
english
pale
but
meh
came
to
me
in
an
american
pint
glass
amber
color
with
little
head
that
eaves
some
lacing
theres
some
smell
of
hops
not
much
the
taste
is
great
a
little
bitter
but
not
in
a
bad
way
mouthfeel
is
very
good
light
carbonation
makes
it
very
smooth
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
other
english
pale
ales
that
i
would
pick
first
but
if
my
choices
were
this
or
a
macro
i
would
take
this
beer
bass
is
normally
one
of
my
favorite
drinks
but
the
metallic
flavoring
was
an
unwelcome
surprise
definitely
allow
it
to
warm
a
bit
before
drinking
or
just
have
it
on
tap
nice
copper
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
poured
into
my
favorite
snifter
so
i
could
get
a
whiff
i
can
tell
bass
any
day
taste
is
medium
strength
for
this
type
of
ale
pleasant
once
again
mouthfeel
is
not
too
thin
but
definitely
not
all
that
heavy
drinkability
is
fine
for
me
had
quite
a
few
of
these
in
college
so
all
i
can
say
is
typical
bass
good
goto
when
everyone
else
is
drinking
bmc
products
most
places
have
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
full
flavored
beer
that
is
actually
quite
enjoyablebest
to
let
it
warm
a
little
than
all
the
flavors
and
aroma
comes
at
you
a
little
strongerquite
tasty
worth
a
try
this
is
drinkable
didnt
care
for
the
smell
that
much
but
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
ale
d
a
classic
version
of
an
epa
something
that
you
can
drink
very
easily
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
beginner
beer
geek
this
beer
just
has
a
good
taste
to
it
its
nothing
particularly
fancy
but
it
just
has
a
good
taste
malt
dominates
with
the
taste
of
alcohol
but
the
aftertaste
turns
sweet
almost
fruity
like
a
hint
of
cherry
maybe
its
the
red
tint
in
the
brew
that
makes
me
think
cherry
not
much
hops
evident
to
my
taste
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
d
average
it
is
a
novel
and
fad
for
those
visiting
british
style
pubs
made
me
miss
my
st
arnolds
brews
though
bass
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
with
thin
head
that
doesnt
linger
its
aroma
is
a
light
fruity
maltiness
i
smell
a
hint
of
berries
maybe
strawberries
the
aroma
finishes
with
hints
of
toffee
and
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
the
flavor
is
crisp
almost
tart
there
is
less
maltiness
in
the
taste
but
some
sweetness
sticks
through
with
light
metallic
bitterness
i
think
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
over
all
but
its
fairly
solid
good
in
a
pinch
when
there
are
few
other
options
if
i
was
going
to
make
a
black
and
tan
i
could
think
of
about
a
dozen
better
tan
portions
than
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
that
comes
to
the
top
and
then
fades
away
slightly
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
along
with
some
grain
smells
the
taste
of
this
one
is
the
grain
and
some
of
the
malt
and
very
little
of
the
hops
come
through
mouth
feeling
is
bubbly
and
not
too
filling
a
nice
beer
da
it
starts
out
o
k
but
very
quickly
goes
down
hill
fast
as
recently
as
two
years
ago
bass
was
one
of
my
goto
brews
my
wife
remains
fond
of
it
so
it
pops
up
in
my
fridge
with
some
frequency
but
ive
moved
this
one
onto
my
stayawayfrom
list
this
used
to
be
an
old
standard
of
mine
in
precraft
days
when
i
felt
like
putting
down
the
cash
for
import
prices
unexceptionality
aside
its
still
reliable
enough
especially
if
a
bar
has
nothing
else
but
american
macro
piss
its
main
feature
is
a
pure
and
simple
drinkability
accentuated
by
that
great
finishaftertaste
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
my
time
it
pours
out
with
a
nice
healthy
head
and
a
rich
glow
the
smell
is
not
perfect
but
definitely
intruiging
and
the
taste
it
goes
down
extremely
easy
begging
you
to
take
another
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
pure
it
tastes
good
and
cant
steer
you
wrong
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
and
always
keep
it
stocked
in
the
fridge
pours
more
of
an
copper
amber
color
with
a
head
thats
thin
aroma
is
of
malt
and
hops
mildly
hoppy
which
i
like
taste
is
more
on
the
malt
side
but
it
seems
to
fall
thin
towards
the
back
of
the
throat
the
hops
dont
show
as
much
somewhat
fruity
nothing
impressive
but
still
somewhat
above
a
typical
macro
had
this
on
tap
and
took
notes
just
getting
to
putting
them
down
this
was
one
of
my
first
imported
pales
pours
a
dark
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
that
goes
down
quicly
leaving
very
little
lacing
the
taste
has
a
little
bite
up
front
and
then
moves
to
some
malts
and
finishes
smooth
mouthfeel
is
balanced
with
the
carbonation
and
works
well
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
choices
at
most
chain
restaraunts
when
i
cant
get
something
more
sophisticated
drinkability
a
good
relaxing
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
meal
or
just
to
sip
off
of
d
drinkable
even
sessionable
but
as
i
said
before
its
nothing
special
it
was
the
best
option
last
night
when
confronted
with
a
bar
full
of
macros
and
i
was
happy
to
find
it
but
next
time
ill
find
a
better
bar
pale
amber
with
head
that
it
didnt
retain
for
long
not
bad
but
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
consistent
taste
on
draft
have
had
it
when
it
seemed
much
better
than
other
times
one
of
the
first
imports
you
could
find
everywhere
the
taste
seems
a
bit
metallic
but
has
a
sweet
character
to
it
decent
session
brew
d
mildly
flavorful
goes
down
easy
when
poured
properly
a
great
pale
ale
for
all
seasons
at
dinner
tonight
at
one
of
the
usual
chain
restaurants
whats
on
tap
nah
nah
nah
maybe
nah
guinness
and
bass
ive
done
the
guinness
a
lot
so
why
not
bass
608
reviews
as
of
this
writing
so
classic
old
faithful
cherished
forgotten
and
overlooked
many
times
yet
still
ready
for
the
next
time
yeah
i
gotta
order
this
on
tap
again
in
the
future
worth
a
visit
taste
also
followed
the
lines
of
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
malt
virtually
no
hops
standing
out
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
but
normal
for
a
beer
of
this
type
drinkability
i
remember
this
beer
from
y
college
days
and
i
have
to
believe
either
the
beer
has
changed
or
my
palate
has
its
a
decent
beer
very
drinkable
but
overall
very
average
its
like
a
macro
english
pale
ale
nothing
more
nothing
less
just
ok
nothing
to
brag
about
drinkability
if
you
can
find
this
stuff
on
tap
drink
it
if
not
the
nitrocan
version
is
also
quite
nice
light
honeycaramel
orangeyellow
color
head
is
very
dense
very
thick
and
keeps
going
until
the
end
of
the
beer
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
hopsharp
with
the
hops
edging
out
by
a
bit
taste
was
a
bit
mildmannered
some
creamy
sweetness
that
moves
more
towards
hop
toward
the
end
malt
flavors
were
mild
and
the
hops
stepped
out
a
bit
more
bordering
on
thin
and
low
carbonation
ill
give
the
drinkability
just
over
average
because
its
not
unpleasant
nor
bad
just
not
awesome
drinkability
is
good
because
this
is
a
lightbodied
beer
without
much
richness
in
any
department
that
being
said
it
would
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
not
the
most
refreshing
beer
sharp
bitterness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
d
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
good
flavor
this
lives
up
to
the
unfortunate
stereotype
of
all
things
english
in
that
its
bland
as
hell
in
every
way
copper
color
head
is
ehhh
smell
is
wait
a
minute
what
smell
what
little
trace
there
is
of
an
aroma
is
similar
to
perrier
flavor
starts
out
ok
sweet
caramel
malt
it
takes
an
unfortunate
turn
about
23
of
the
way
in
and
begins
to
taste
a
bit
like
an
ashtray
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
i
feel
like
i
just
sucked
on
a
penny
a
sticky
penny
i
need
to
find
some
decent
english
beers
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
could
be
an
everyday
beer
and
i
would
dare
say
a
lawnmower
beer
thats
a
good
thing
except
for
one
thing
the
extremely
high
price
that
is
out
of
whack
for
such
an
ordinary
beer
it
is
what
it
is
a
true
to
style
english
pale
ale
thats
a
nice
but
expensive
session
beer
the
taste
stores
a
bit
of
a
bitter
surprise
almost
like
an
esb
with
a
medicinally
hoppy
bite
mixed
with
notes
of
wheat
and
biscuit
its
a
bit
like
drinking
some
orange
juice
too
soon
after
brushing
ones
teeth
mouthfeel
is
juicy
with
a
medium
body
and
belowaverage
carbonation
this
isnt
a
great
pale
ale
by
any
means
but
its
a
decent
attempt
from
the
boys
across
the
pond
i
wont
be
buying
any
anytime
soon
but
id
never
turn
one
down
drinkability
eminently
drinkable
the
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
malt
makes
it
very
pleasant
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
introductory
beer
to
someone
whos
ready
to
move
on
from
the
mass
market
yellow
fizzy
stuff
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
a
fact
that
i
have
tested
vigorously
bass
ale
the
classic
english
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
with
some
lace
the
smell
is
subdued
but
i
do
get
lots
of
buttery
diacetyl
along
with
some
toasted
malt
and
faint
earthy
hops
the
taste
of
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
famous
brewing
water
slightly
salty
very
mineraly
and
even
a
bit
metallic
along
with
a
fair
amount
of
butterscotch
toasted
and
caramel
malts
and
some
earthy
very
british
hop
flavor
and
associated
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
nothing
overly
exciting
ive
got
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
this
beer
in
college
the
only
package
store
within
walking
distance
of
campus
had
a
very
poor
beer
selection
with
a
lot
of
cheep
macro
lagers
to
appeal
to
the
general
college
community
so
i
found
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
bass
and
sam
adams
this
may
not
be
the
best
pale
ale
ever
made
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
one
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
carbonation
is
about
right
for
this
beer
its
drinkability
is
decent
definitely
not
a
regular
for
me
though
overall
its
alright
and
worth
trying
it
pales
in
comparison
to
some
american
pale
ales
though
pardon
the
pun
once
it
warmed
up
a
bit
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
particularly
the
sweet
nose
right
up
to
the
finish
which
left
me
frustrated
that
a
beer
that
easy
soft
pleasant
could
just
finish
so
brashly
it
was
not
by
any
means
bad
but
it
certainly
wasnt
very
good
either
its
a
good
easy
to
drink
example
of
the
genre
that
leaves
rough
bitter
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
trying
something
else
if
giving
a
choice
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
id
recommend
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
an
english
pale
ale
when
i
run
out
of
abbot
and
theres
none
to
buy
this
is
my
ole
standby
this
is
one
beer
that
i
drink
all
evening
and
into
the
night
i
love
drinking
this
while
playing
video
games
the
larger
bottle
i
bought
makes
it
easier
to
play
games
since
youre
not
constantly
getting
up
to
grab
another
bottle
great
beer
d
i
usually
drink
these
whist
hanging
out
with
all
my
mates
at
the
pub
so
i
believe
that
explains
the
amount
a
person
can
drink
of
these
finish
is
semi
short
with
a
mild
lingering
sweetness
d
pretty
drinkable
not
my
first
choice
at
a
bar
my
friend
ordered
it
but
still
not
the
last
time
i
will
have
it
good
and
enjoyable
if
not
outstanding
color
is
a
dark
amber
with
a
hint
of
red
not
much
head
aroma
is
weak
but
inviting
flavor
is
decidedly
malty
very
smooth
without
any
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
than
from
a
bottle
but
i
suspect
most
ales
are
that
way
overall
this
is
pretty
average
maybe
slightly
below
average
the
last
time
i
tried
this
until
today
was
in
london
back
in
2002
and
it
didnt
thrill
me
then
either
i
think
ill
stick
to
st
petes
my
first
taste
impression
was
that
i
didnt
liek
this
particular
ale
however
as
i
finished
the
glass
i
liked
it
alot
more
its
got
a
sweet
tast
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
bittermess
it
almost
seemed
tingly
im
not
sure
if
it
had
to
do
wqith
carbonation
or
something
else
the
mouth
feel
was
average
if
not
just
above
seemed
a
bit
watery
for
my
taste
and
lacking
of
that
it
factor
that
we
all
know
we
want
but
cant
explain
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
smooth
enough
and
low
enough
in
alcohol
to
enjoy
a
few
of
a
good
solid
beer
a
good
choice
and
a
more
common
beer
thats
actually
worth
getting
not
bad
at
all
its
what
i
think
of
when
english
pale
ale
is
mentioned
its
far
from
perfect
and
im
sure
inbevs
presence
in
the
bass
brewhouse
has
done
it
no
favors
but
its
a
fine
session
beer
not
too
challenging
and
no
off
flavors
perfect
for
your
friend
who
doesnt
like
hoppy
or
dark
beers
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
nice
amber
color
no
real
lacing
a
fairly
low
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
looks
like
your
average
beer
nose
is
fairly
mild
mostly
malt
a
little
of
that
standard
sweet
macrolager
smell
to
it
taste
is
overwhelmingly
malty
very
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
just
a
very
mild
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
feel
is
standard
macro
feel
mediumthin
bodied
solid
to
a
little
high
carbonation
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
beer
although
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
hike
over
the
standard
macro
lagers
its
one
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
mostly
because
its
pretty
thin
and
unoffensive
not
bad
but
not
great
either
drinkability
overall
not
much
going
on
here
not
water
but
not
really
impressive
in
the
flavor
department
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
to
drink
at
a
bar
that
doesnt
serve
craft
beer
towards
the
end
it
seemed
more
watery
and
the
aftertaste
became
the
flavour
good
beer
just
not
my
favourite
bass
pale
ale
was
amber
in
color
and
very
clear
it
has
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
that
soon
became
a
thin
layer
with
some
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
english
hops
in
the
backround
the
taste
was
caramel
malt
and
hops
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
a
decent
english
pale
ale
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
was
for
d
very
easy
drinker
and
a
decent
session
beer
all
told
a
fairly
solid
choice
i
would
much
rather
have
a
fullers
esb
or
a
youngs
bitter
than
bass
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
goto
beer
out
here
on
my
personal
beer
desert
island
as
least
its
available
there
were
three
cask
taps
available
two
of
which
were
boddingtons
there
were
also
some
nitro
taps
if
i
had
not
seen
the
bass
poured
i
would
have
sworn
id
got
a
pint
of
some
cream
flow
boddington
like
pint
not
impressive
and
something
that
gives
cask
real
ale
a
bad
name
pours
nice
rich
clear
amber
color
with
a
off
white
two
finger
head
that
held
fairly
well
with
some
good
lacing
smell
fruity
with
some
caramel
aromas
taste
is
sweet
caramel
toasted
malt
and
sweet
fruits
mouthfeel
light
moderate
carbonation
with
a
lightly
slick
feel
on
the
tongue
easy
drinker
good
session
beer
drinkability
nice
beer
on
tap
never
tried
it
in
a
bottle
a
few
times
on
tap
though
i
think
something
has
happened
to
this
brewery
to
be
honest
have
seen
posts
in
the
forums
before
discussing
the
downward
spiral
smells
very
good
hops
first
then
a
more
malty
presencemaybe
even
a
slight
chocolately
maltness
in
it
tastes
great
also
i
let
it
sit
on
my
mouth
and
the
alcohol
warms
the
tongue
has
a
unique
aftertaste
drinkability
is
exceptional
would
love
to
have
these
all
day
long
if
it
werent
for
schoolwork
the
taste
is
not
that
enjoyable
to
me
its
a
bit
sour
a
bit
too
malty
up
front
and
has
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
this
goes
along
with
the
watery
taste
i
just
couldnt
shake
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
its
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
anyway
you
can
find
it
everywhere
but
frankly
there
are
other
beer
just
as
accessible
that
are
better
than
this
one
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
nice
dark
copperamber
color
with
little
head
and
some
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smell
of
slightly
roasted
malts
and
some
hop
bitterness
some
roasted
malt
at
first
followed
by
a
good
slug
of
bitterhop
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
goes
down
easily
enough
but
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
13
25cdn
per
sixer
though
nothing
surprising
in
the
flavor
a
decent
pale
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
nice
full
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
i
could
see
the
practical
element
to
having
it
in
a
can
in
penn
station
and
i
would
happily
buy
this
again
in
a
can
poured
clear
amber
with
a
finegrained
white
head
that
dropped
to
a
halfinch
and
stayed
medium
lacing
smell
is
very
faint
biscuity
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
light
for
a
pale
ale
especialy
compared
to
some
of
the
american
micro
pas
on
the
market
today
not
a
lot
of
hops
but
the
chalky
quality
of
the
burtonontrent
water
is
very
noticable
and
to
my
palate
anyway
round
and
pleasing
this
imo
seems
like
the
bud
light
of
pale
ales
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
forming
a
12
inch
head
that
quickly
faded
leaving
medium
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
weak
but
what
is
detectable
is
a
nice
citrus
aroma
the
taste
is
very
light
having
little
hop
flavor
and
an
equal
amount
of
malts
does
not
have
the
hoppy
flavor
that
i
expect
from
a
pale
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
thin
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
the
one
that
i
would
turn
to
when
i
want
an
english
pale
ale
however
i
do
love
this
with
guinness
in
a
black
tan
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
to
be
blunt
apple
sourness
is
what
dominated
my
palatte
the
whole
time
had
a
hard
time
even
finishing
the
pint
next
time
i
go
to
an
irish
pub
i
wont
be
ordering
this
again
three
down
and
three
to
go
next
up
guinness
draught
thin
watery
and
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
and
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
though
last
night
after
three
pints
i
had
to
switch
to
smithwicks
bass
might
have
a
better
brew
but
the
pale
ale
is
not
one
of
them
d
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
this
one
again
poured
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
huge
fizzy
head
and
laced
quite
a
bit
picked
up
very
little
on
the
nose
of
this
one
maybe
some
malts
taste
was
a
bit
fruitier
then
i
remebered
tasted
fresh
very
carbonated
overall
this
is
decent
not
a
favorite
but
decent
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
more
readily
available
pale
ales
this
one
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
good
light
head
a
bit
of
a
grassy
scent
and
malt
a
distinctly
bready
flavor
that
finishes
a
bit
bitter
clean
finish
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
is
often
followed
by
another
one
pours
amber
with
little
head
retention
for
some
reason
i
dont
smell
a
thing
when
this
beer
is
poured
the
taste
is
slightly
buttery
with
hints
of
caramel
but
the
texture
is
slightly
thin
very
drinkable
though
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
all
in
all
pretty
good
as
an
irish
american
my
praise
can
somewhat
be
light
for
a
british
beer
but
i
have
to
give
them
their
due
good
job
with
the
bass
the
taste
was
dominated
by
buttery
caramel
malt
followed
by
an
abrupt
metallic
twang
it
felt
thin
and
watery
on
the
palate
and
overall
didnt
make
much
of
a
lasting
impression
overall
slightly
above
average
and
worth
the
2pint
special
price
poured
a
clear
golden
rust
color
1
finger
head
that
left
some
lacing
head
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
of
caramel
malts
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
slight
metalic
hop
bitterness
nice
carbonation
with
a
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
but
not
bitter
this
ale
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
drink
many
of
these
i
actually
bought
these
as
an
offset
to
some
heavier
beers
so
far
2
out
of
the
5
in
the
6r
were
dead
flat
lets
hope
the
other
is
not
flat
d
the
flavor
is
decent
enough
to
go
for
more
as
nothing
truly
stands
out
in
this
beer
still
better
than
many
other
widely
available
selections
so
itd
bed
easier
and
tastier
than
others

just
is

not
great
fairly
onedimentional
smell
was
a

stale

yeasty

it

better
could
taste
a
woody
almost
oaklike
flavor
as
well
as
some
fruit
and
sugar
one
that
i
would
have
again
but
certainly
not
a
favorite
bham
uk
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
rocky
yet
frothy
head
and
raised
lacing
patterns
head
peters
out
all
too
soon
there
are
some
aromas
characteristic
of
english
pales
like
the
toasty
malt
noble
hops
and
slight
diacetyl
but
this
is
cut
short
by
a
sharp
metallic
twinge
starts
off
real
nice
in
the
flavor
catagory
with
pleasant
malt
hop
and
diacetyl
flavors
all
rushing
into
my
mouth
but
then
comes
this
awful
yeast
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
mix
of
notyetready
homebrew
and
bakers
yeast
all
other
positive
flavors
seem
to
wash
out
quickly
yet
the
yeast
still
remains
oh
and
there
was
that
metallic
thing
in
the
finish
as
well
starts
out
nice
then
gets
really
gross
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
is
just
fine
by
me
nice
and
mellow
just
how
i
like
my
english
pales
however
the
body
is
too
thin
and
watery
the
weird
astringent
yeast
character
and
watery
body
just
dont
add
up
to
a
good
drinker
with
all
the
pales
out
there
that
are
cheaper
and
taste
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
better
theres
no
reason
for
me
to
ever
buy
this
ever
again
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
average
the
color
was
amber
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
was
almost
nonexistent
with
only
a
faint
smell
of
hops
taste
was
full
bodied
but
there
was
a
slightly
sour
after
taste
that
i
could
hardly
bear
might
have
been
a
bad
keg
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
drinkability
was
pretty
good
with
the
exception
of
the
after
taste
im
going
to
give
this
one
another
try
this
pale
ale
is
an
easy
to
get
down
sessionable
ale
not
very
complex
i
detected
some
caramel
malts
and
brown
sugar
very
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
quaffable
very
crisp
very
refreshing
no
frills
pale
ale
give
it
a
try
if
nothing
else
is
readily
available
i
wonderful
brew
i
just
hope
i
can
get
it
on
draft
next
time
very
nicely
done
bass
brewers
ltd
i
find
this
ale
to
be
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
the
color
is
brilliant
amber
and
flavor
is
mildy
fruity
i
enjoy
the
label
design
with
the
englands
first
trademark
displayed
prominently
it
has
hints
of
hops
and
is
sufficently
carbonated
and
highly
quaffable
this
beer
pours
to
light
amber
with
little
to
no
head
with
a
slightly
hoppy
smell
with
a
hint
of
malt
this
was
a
fairly
average
beer
with
an
almost
watery
taste
with
a
light
hops
character
it
was
very
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
was
light
i
could
drink
this
instead
of
water
its
simply
that
smooth
this
went
well
with
my
steak
dinner
drank
pretty
easy
this
beer
can
be
hit
or
miss
not
sure
if
that
has
to
with
how
fast
it
turns
over
when
its
on
its
great
even
better
on
cask
that
was
a
few
years
ago
sigh
about
what
i
expected
not
a
horrible
beer
but
there
is
no
complexity
to
speak
of
pretty
much
your
average
mass
produced
beer
that
is
produced
for
the
masses
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
massive
white
puffy
head
modest
lacing
light
fruity
smell
but
nothing
overly
impressive
taste
is
moderately
malty
but
nothing
overly
impressive
finish
is
also
very
mild
and
unimpressive
an
eay
to
drink
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
this
is
just
an
average
euro
pale
ale
its
not
bad
but
theres
better
it
has
a
descent
flavor
nothignt
oo
harsh
better
drank
cold
appearence
is
dark
smells
is
bitter
sweet
mouthfeel
is
fair
again
not
weak
i
would
class
this
as
a
mid
grade
pale
ale
have
i
had
better
beer
sure
have
i
had
my
times
when
i
dont
like
this
at
all
sure
but
i
keep
coming
back
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
d
if
you
can
get
this
on
tap
instead
of
bottle
you
are
better
off
both
are
good
and
will
depend
on
what
you
prefer
a
very
fine
brew
not
wild
by
any
means
but
a
standard
bearer
for
the
style
on
the
taste
scale
it
may
seem
muted
compared
to
an
american
pale
ale
but
a
good
sessionable
beer
none
the
less
pours
a
nice
reddishamber
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
some
decent
malt
and
breadyness
in
the
nose
has
a
nice
malt
and
caramel
flavor
together
with
some
hops
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
more
bitterness
but
not
much
has
a
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
finish
with
some
lingering
hops
a
good
beer
with
no
real
faults
goes
down
nicely
when
youre
raced
with
few
choices
at
a
abr
this
is
a
good
friend
to
turn
to
poured
a
hazy
dark
red
amber
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
and
slight
lacing
smell
was
good
sweet
malts
caramel
and
butterscotch
caramel
is
once
again
present
in
the
taste
as
are
spicybitter
hops
and
a
faint
fruit
character
the
aftertaste
lingers
somewhat
but
is
pleasantenough
with
a
balance
between
the
sweet
and
bitter
characteristics
of
the
brew
the
beer
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
up
front
is
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
ends
somewhat
dry
overall
i
think
this
a
fine
session
beer
decent
on
all
counts
not
really
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
golden
amber
body
with
a
dense
light
beige
head
that
leaves
decent
amounts
of
lacing
hint
of
nut
in
the
nose
along
with
some
lightly
roasted
malt
and
sweet
fruit
first
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
followed
by
floral
hop
with
low
bitterness
and
some
nut
that
leaves
my
mouth
feeling
dry
creamy
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
easy
drinker
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
get
my
buzz
on
y
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
bright
with
notes
of
citrus
and
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy
there
is
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
drinkability

hey
its
a
bass
poured
into
a
standard
pint
tumbler
very
nice
sized
head
at
least
two
fingers
it
took
its
time
to
recede
maintained
a
good
lace
smell
wasnt
very
strong
but
i
could
make
out
some
sweetness
taste
is
a
little
on
the
malty
side
but
there
was
a
slight
bit
of
hops
bitterness
the
malt
was
a
bit
smokey
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
i
think
i
overlook
bass
sometimes
it
was
great
with
pizza
i
should
give
it
a
chance
more
often
bass
has
a
malty
sweet
flavor
its
very
easy
to
drink
nice
amber
color
not
much
foam
it
gives
off
a
pleasant
nutty
smell
hop
character
is
very
slight
overall
bass
pale
ale
is
a
decent
beer
sweet
and
refreshing
it
differs
a
lot
from
an
american
pale
ale
in
the
fact
that
theres
hardly
any
hops
its
good
when
youre
craving
something
less
bitter
than
usual
this
is
the
inbev
version
i
have
to
find
my
notes
of
some
years
ago
for
the
original
one
much
sharper
around
the
edges
than
most
pales
superb
balance
of
sweetness
and
kick
while
magically
eliminating
a
strong
aftertaste
love
the
accessability
of
this
beer
and
its
no
more
than
guinnes
or
heineken
at
you
local
grocer
a
beer
with
more
diversity
than
most
of
the
other
mass
produced
imports
when
it
comes
to
food
smell
is
a
bit
roasty
and
smokey
of
malt
not
much
hop
aroma
and
not
too
complex
taste
is
a
bit
nutty
and
sweet
a
little
dry
and
roasty
with
a
clean
sort
of
sweet
aftertaste
not
a
whole
lot
of
interesting
stuff
going
on
here
but
its
tasty
and
drinable
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
and
light
carbonation
helps
it
go
down
easy
not
a
bad
choice
if
youre
limited
to
macros
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
old
standby
on
tap
much
smoother
than
the
bottle
and
more
flavorful
as
well
the
taste
is
interesting
but
unintrusive
enough
to
drink
just
for
fun
for
those
times
when
picking
out
every
little
subtle
flavor
is
not
the
main
idea
overall
this
is
just
a
pretty
average
beer
for
drinking
without
much
thinking
a
solid
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
major
smell
and
taste
is
hop
bitterness
much
less
complex
smell
and
taste
that
hoppy
american
ipas
also
has
a
thinner
mouth
feel
than
american
ipas
overall
a
simple
quaffing
english
pale
ale
eric
taste
is
light
and
crisp
and
pleasant
if
fairly
simple
and
a
little
watery
no
real
hop
attack
as
in
most
pale
ales
but
this
is
basic
tasty
stuff
sessionable
in
a
pinch
but
i
likely
wouldnt
choose
it
unless
confronted
only
by
other
macros
bass
ale
could
easily
pass
for
a
weak
amber
lager
while
this
could
be
a
refreshing
summer
ale
it
lacks
the
basic
qualities
one
should
expect
from
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
staple
at
most
pubs
english
irish
and
american
alike
and
for
good
reason
it
lacks
big
beer
taste
that
is
found
in
many
other
english
ales
but
considering
the
fact
that
it
is
such
a
mass
produced
macrobrewed
beer
its
still
pretty
damn
good
pours
a
copperish
amber
with
med
head
and
light
lacing
smell
is
light
crisp
hops
and
very
mild
graininess
taste
is
lightly
hopped
with
a
miniscule
touch
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
minimal
but
just
shy
of
watery
bass
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
youll
find
yourself
finishing
a
pint
or
pitcher
faster
than
you
thought
every
time
you
drink
it
if
only
american
macros
could
emulate
bass
ive
always
liked
bass
ale
especially
for
a
massproduced
widelydistributred
beer
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
truly
great
ales
but
a
damn
good
one
given
the
price
when
eating
or
drinking
out
where
micro
and
crafts
are
not
available
this
is
one
beer
ill
readily
drink
a
hell
of
a
step
above
most
american
or
import
macros
final
statement
this
beer
is
a
real
classic
if
you
can
get
a
fresh
sample
enjoy
yet
another
english
pale
ale
that
hasnt
impressed
me
i
dont
know
if
its
the
nitrocan
or
what
but
its
just
very
boring
at
least
there
is
a
slight
bit
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
even
if
its
very
mild
quite
popular
but
i
cant
quite
see
why
worth
trying
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
but
not
one
i
really
plan
on
getting
again
notes
overall
this
is
a
thoroughly
decent
if
basic
beer
it
is
a
classic
and
certainly
better
than
any
of
the
big
domestic
macros
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
not
impressed
at
all
pours
a
nice
amber
color
both
the
lacing
and
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
there
were
hints
of
caramel
in
the
nose
but
overall
there
wasnt
too
much
there
as
for
the
taste
it
started
with
hops
and
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
and
finished
very
clean
good
mouthfeel
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
an
easily
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
certainly
have
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
holds
decently
without
any
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
with
aromas
of
caramel
and
amber
malts
the
taste
is
an
echo
of
the
smell
all
malts
not
much
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
thick
with
even
carbonation
overall
its
a
nice
session
beer
and
one
that
wouldnt
be
bad
to
fall
back
on
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
english
ales
and
this
one
is
not
leading
me
down
the
right
path
although
low
in
alcohol
i
really
wouldnt
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
odd
handbell
shaped
bottle
1
pt
3
25
oz
pours
faded
copper
with
a
semisticky
manilla
head
aromas
are
fairly
floral
but
the
hop
presence
is
quite
subdued
some
biscuity
malts
appear
as
well
faint
floral
and
spicy
hop
flavor
with
light
toasted
bread
malts
mouthfeel
is
far
too
thin
indeed
its
rather
watery
i
used
to
really
adore
this
beer
years
ago
in
fact
the
friend
who
gave
me
this
bottle
did
so
because
he
remembered
me
being
such
a
big
fan
knowing
how
many
great
beers
in
general
and
pale
ales
specifically
there
are
out
there
i
cant
ever
see
myself
choosing
this
unless
there
were
no
other
better
options
available
d
good
drinkability
i
like
to
make
this
a
session
beer
everyone
once
in
a
while
for
its
extreme
availability
this
is
one
that
i
think
is
usually
worth
the
price
as
far
as
six
packs
go
at
least
it
may
get
a
bit
expensive
at
pubs
and
on
tap
and
whatnot
not
too
much
alcohol
a
flavorful
brew
and
easy
to
drink
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
a
simple
brew
one
i
would
have
again
if
offered
ive
turned
to
more
of
an
american
ipa
fan
but
this
always
works
for
me
in
a
pinch
at
a
restaurant
or
when
i
need
a
reasonably
priced
12
pk
poured
from
draft
into

glass
detected
a

and

a
little
better
than
before
light
yet
flavorful
ratings
upgraded
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
best
describes
this
beers
mouthfeel
doesnt
finish
dry
and
seems
like
it
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
feels
good
in
the
mouth
almost
creamya
reflection
of
the
head
and
carbonation
isnt
in
the
way
this
is
a
good
beer
would
make
a
great
session
but
i
prefer
apas
as
opposed
to
the
english
version
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
in
the
future
but
not
that
often
perhaps
only
to
make
black
and
tans
goes
down
easy
but
just
doesnt
hit
the
spot
like
a
good
apa
i
know
this
is
a
different
style
but
thats
just
what
i
prefer
good
color
not
cloudy
average
head
smells
like
beer
should
smell
body
is
still
quite
thin
but
the
micro
bubbles
of
nitro
carbonation
give
it
a
slick
creamy
mouthfeel
great
burton
ale
massmarket
but
retaining
its
outstanding
quality
and
great
taste
aroma
is
fruityhoppy
color
is
pale
gold
carbonation
rather
high
helping
to
form
an
accurate
crown
taste
is
gentle
and
complex
with
some
grain
caramelized
malts
and
delightful
hops
this
beer
can
be
your
thirstquencher
or
a
long
drink
everything
you
want
it
to
be
just
dont
serve
it
too
cold
d
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
reliable
to
session
the
sweetness
can
be
a
little
too
much
sometimes
but
good
overall
im
really
glad
this
experience
was
what
i
remember
of
bass
my
last
serving
was
from
the
tap
and
was
not
as
pleasant
this
classic
english
pale
has
really
defined
the
style
worldwide
due
to
the
brewery
longevity
and
its
good
distribution
perhaps
not
the
best
english
pale
but
the
standard
by
which
all
are
measured
cheers
tastes
just
like
the
aromas
with
a
fine
balance
between
hoppy
bitterness
and
malty
sweetness
theres
a
metallic
finish
that
i
dont
like
and
decided
to
dock
a
halfpoint
for
but
theres
also
a
good
bit
of
depth
displayed
via
floral
and
elemental
tones
with
a
bold
but
tame
mouthfeel
and
the
depth
of
flavor
its
a
good
thing
this
beer
is
as
widely
available
as
it
is
proving
once
again
that
nobody
nobody
needs
to
just
settle
and
have
a
bud
or
mgd
or
some
such
thing
an
allaround
yummy
beer
makes
a
great
session
drink
ive
only
had
it
ontap
once
that
i
can
recallpints
and
pints
with
bangers
and
mash
at
epcot
center
in
orlandobut
based
on
my
limited
experience
i
would
say
that
it
is
one
of
those
beers
where
the
bottled
version
doesnt
do
it
justice
i
just
cant
help
but
think
back
on
what
this
beer
was
20
years
ago
its
almost
heartbreaking
to
see
what
it
has
become
this
is
english
ab
or
miller
now
sad
sad
sad
avoid
it
if
youre
looking
for
anything
with
character
d
goes
down
really
easy
easy
to
drink
but
not
too
complex
a
safe
bet
for
a
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
medium
body
good
carbonation
mild
alcohol
content
and
an
average
nondescript
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
yet
far
from
spectacular
sessions
anyone
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
flat
on
the
tongue
uninspiring
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
not
exploding
with
character
but
good
to
have
around
in
a
pinch
bass
pale
ale
pours
an
orange
hue
with
a
thick
off
white
head
from
a
brown
bottle
the
smell
is
underwhelming
not
much
of
anything
does
have
typical
english
pale
ale
character
but
in
a
muted
sort
of
way
kind
of
like
its
been
dumbed
down
im
not
particularly
impressed
not
bad
what
i
usually
opt
for
at
a
crappy
irish
bar
on
the
south
shore
here
in
mass
basic
but
goes
down
nice
you
could
do
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
worse
d
drinkable
i
guess
english
pale
ales
do
not
have
as
much
hops
as
an
apa
i
believe
this
is
my
first
epa
not
a
bad
brew
but
will
most
likely
not
buy
again
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
but
better
than
many
large
labels
readily
available
for
its
price
however
something
better
could
certainly
be
found
this
beer
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
i
am
sure
i
will
buy
it
again
poured
a
golden
brown
with
a
good
head
and
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
ok
but
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
the
taste
is
of
hops
and
malt
has
a
slight
kick
to
it
so
if
youre
a
bud
drinker
you
may
want
to
try
this
if
you
feel
like
something
a
little
different
mouthfeel
is
very
good
bc
of
the
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
good
color
and
head
underwhelming
smell
quite
a
smooth
taste
and
not
too
much
disturbance
on
the
tongue
going
down
smooth
all
around
and
i
dont
think
thats
100
a
good
thing
here
its
just
too
blah
too
boring
im
just
not
excited
by
the
taste
however
i
definitely
like
this
one
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
this
is
your
benchmark
english
pale
ale
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
creamy
mouthfeel
and
oh
so
drinkable
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
quite
sessionable
d
high
i
love
thses
very
easy
to
pound
even
my
girlfriend
like
bass
which
says
alot
for
its
drinkability
flavor
was
malts
brown
sugar
and
a
mild
hop
finish
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
the
tap
version
to
be
im
pretty
sure
id
be
a
full
point
higher
if
this
was
either
fresher
or
from
a
tap
will
have
to
locate
it
somewhere
and
review
again
at
later
date
while
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
same
character
that
other
pale
ales
possess
its
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
id
love
to
try
some
fresh
ontap
as
im
sure
it
would
stand
up
to
some
of
the
good
pale
ales
we
have
on
the
local
scene
much
better
than
this
bottle
does
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
tastes
a
little
sweeter
in
the
can
than
i
remember
from
the
bottle
a
good
solid
english
pale
ale
a
grainy
smell
with
hint
of
caramel
very
similar
to
penn
dark
but
milder
the
mouthfeel
was
great
i
really
enjoyed
how
it
felt
on
my
tongue
tasted
like
grain
with
a
nice
caramel
flavoring
a
real
treat
i
will
enjoy
in
the
future
a
great
beer
you
can
find
anywhere
poured
from
the
pub
pour
can
that
falsely
promised
a
thick
and
long
lasting
head
i
tried
my
best
to
induce
a
head
only
came
up
with
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
that
quickly
disapeared
color
was
light
copper
with
little
to
no
lacing
i
was
unable
to
get
much
aroma
out
of
this
brew
along
with
trying
to
pour
a
large
head
i
was
also
agitating
the
beer
but
was
unable
to
get
any
real
aroma
out
of
it
taste
was
average
smooth
with
hints
of
malt
and
hops
but
nothing
special
when
it
comes
to
ales
clean
in
the
mouth
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
stuff
again
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
really
one
of
my
favorites
either
a
yummy
beer
allinall
id
have
it
again
ideally
next
time
on
an
engine
amber
to
orangered
in
color
with
a
pretty
average
head
the
smell
is
mostly
just
malt
and
hops
not
too
weak
or
too
strong
the
taste
is
basically
malty
with
some
bitter
hops
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
highly
carbonated
i
think
this
beer
lacks
constancy
sometimes
ive
had
really
good
batches
and
some
that
missed
the
mark
recently
i
was
dining
at
a
restaurant
with
a
friend
and
the
waitress
most
likely
accidentally
sold
pitchers
to
us
at
the
domestic
special
price
of
3
a
pitcher
same
as
the
macro
swill
not
only
that
but
for
some
reason
the
beer
seemed
especially
sweet
that
night
maybe
it
was
just
the
price
note
i
had
this
with
the
thai
chicken
pizzathe
combo
makes
me
want
to
weep
openly
because
it
is
so
good
pours
a
very
nice
dark
amber
with
a
nice
head
aroma
has
hints
of
toasted
malt
and
hops
the
hops
have
an
initial
bite
on
the
tongue
but
hten
fade
aftertaste
is
kind
of
sweet
maybe
too
much
so
good
mouthfeel
a
well
balanced
brew
in
terms
of
gravityibu
not
a
bad
standby
if
only
macros
are
available
pours
a
nice
amber
color
frothy
white
head
about
an
inch
thick
with
an
assortment
of
bubble
sizes
head
went
down
after
about
5
minutes
leaving
a
small
bit
a
lacing
the
smell
has
a
small
bit
of
roastiness
to
it
also
has
sweetness
in
the
smell
starts
off
with
a
smooth
malty
taste
then
ends
with
a
slight
butter
taste
and
a
dash
of
bitterness
not
bad
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
this
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
smallish
head
the
smell
is
faint
with
some
malt
to
it
the
taste
has
alot
of
malt
and
not
much
else
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
because
this
is
a
tasty
beer
the
mf
is
light
and
a
little
watery
this
is
a
pretty
good
brewbut
there
are
better
ones
pours
a
medium
copper
with
a
bonecolored
head
that
builds
to
a
finger
high
and
dissipates
reasonably
slowly
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
to
begin
with
although
it
doesnt
hold
up
as
the
beer
gets
drunk
carbonation
is
very
visible
smells
include
malty
sweetness
butter
caramel
and
fruitiness
with
a
medicinal
note
present
as
well
tastes
of
burnt
caramel
and
malt
with
a
buttery
flavour
and
slight
hoppiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fairly
well
carbonated
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
not
exceptional
by
any
measure
but
a
reasonably
priced
and
enjoyable
drink
this
was
probably
my
first
favorite
beer
but
its
been
a
little
while
since
ive
had
it
im
glad
it
holds
up
to
my
memories
its
certainly
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
i
could
still
drink
this
all
day
long
to
me
bass
is
unique
and
identifiable
but
i
think
for
my
tastes
it
is
just
a
tad
too
subdued
for
a
pale
ale
particularly
in
the
hop
department
still
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
to
try
at
least
once
definitely
a
great
beer
should
drink
it
more
often
yet
there
are
too
many
other
pale
ales
out
there
drinkabilityyears
ago
i
really
liked
bass
that
was
until
i
began
to
experiment
with
many
different
beers
i
still
like
it
but
only
on
occasion
like
a
free
one
good
on
a
hot
day
what
else
can
you
say
for
all
know
this
is
the
uk
version
of
bud
but
it
was
very
drinkable
a
little
heavy
and
dark
for
pale
ale
but
good
just
the
same
at
4
a
bottle
imported
or
not
its
a
little
over
priced
the
waitress
commented
that
she
didnt
serve
much
of
this
beer
and
thats
probably
why
wtf
tastes
worse
this
time
i
cant
believe
this
is
bass
because
it
tastes
like
pure
ass
the
taste
is
extremely
sweet
it
is
sugary
and
kind
of
tastes
like
fruit
rollup
there
is
a
slight
citrus
tase
but
almost
no
bitterness
at
all
mothfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
its
all
wrong
for
a
british
pale
this
is
probably
the
most
readily
available
decent
quality
ale
in
america
or
at
least
my
part
of
it
pale
ale
is
really
a
misnomer
by
the
way
at
least
to
us
americans
who
tend
to
consume
a
lot
of
cheap
macro
lagers
but
then
again
relatively
pale
as
ales
go
or
pale
compared
to
brown
ale
sound
really
stupid
anyway
color
is
a
sort
of
goldbrown
so
if
you
compare
it
to
american
lagersit
falls
more
into
the
color
range
of
a
beer
i
might
drink
killians
yuengling
traditional
sam
adams
saranac
smooth
lager
than
a
pale
lager
seems
like
this
gives
more
weight
to
the
arguement
if
youre
drinking
a
bright
yellow
beer
youre
arent
drinking
a
real
beer
anyway
once
a
neophyte
like
me
wraps
his
head
around
the
concept
that
pale
ales
arent
that
pale
the
color
is
pleasant
the
head
tends
to
be
well
formed
though
not
very
high
smell
is
malty
almost
a
bit
buttery
or
nutty
as
well
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
up
front
sometimes
with
little
hits
of
those
nuts
or
that
butter
in
the
background
finish
is
fairly
bitter
but
surprisingly
for
me
not
unpleasant
bass
is
also
cleaner
tasting
than
i
thought
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
but
not
too
thick
it
quenches
thrist
pretty
well
but
i
only
gave
drinkability
an
average
rating
because
i
just
never
seem
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
basses
unless
i
have
no
other
choice
its
so
common
around
here
that
i
actually
use
this
as
a
standby
sometimes
when
even
such
ordinary
choices
as
my
personal
favorite
yuengling
traditional
arent
available
all
in
all
i
think
this
stuff
deserves
its
popularity
as
one
of
the
worlds
top
selling
ales
im
sure
there
are
better
ones
out
there
and
ive
even
tried
at
least
one
superior
ale
myself
but
theres
no
doubt
for
almost
anyone
whos
tried
it
that
bass
is
a
quality
beer
and
a
good
example
of
its
type
and
yes
its
still
a
decent
beer
when
its
warm
though
i
certainly
prefer
it
cold
what
can
i
say
im
american
a
side
note
the
robust
flavor
good
qualityand
slightly
higher
than
average
alcohol
content
make
bass
my
favorite
beer
for
cooking
overall
an
ok
beer
that
i
wouldnt
pass
up
if
someone
handed
me
one
again
much
better
brew
ontap
versus
bottle
or
can
this
is
often
my
brew
of
choice
at
my
local
hangout
which
obviously
does
not
boast
the
best
brews
in
the
world
but
i
like
it
its
easy
to
drink
without
being
too
overwhelming
to
your
taste
buds
and
its
not
too
filling
its
tasty
enough
malts
and
hops
balance
each
other
well
with
some
lovely
caramel
and
grainy
undertones
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
bubbly
quite
drinkable
an
overall
good
beer
would
probably
make
a
good
session
beer
do
not
drink
this
out
of
the
bottle
though
ontap
is
much
better
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
except
that
it
is
an
old
standard
nothing
great
it
is
exactly
what
you
should
expect
out
of
an
epa
this
beer
came
a
reddish
brown
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
left
decent
lacing
around
the
top
of
my
glass
smelled
faintly
of
oranges
pine
and
sweet
oats
with
a
dry
doughy
yeast
tasted
of
a
sour
dryness
with
no
substantial
malt
and
a
slight
pineapple
finished
with
a
heavy
dryness
the
most
flavors
came
if
i
exhaled
through
my
nose
there
was
a
delicious
yeasty
pine
smell
mouth
feel
was
thin
with
mild
carbonation
whats
the
hype
about
bass
again
not
bad
but
a
little
harsh
going
down
with
a
nasty
aftertaste
more
sour
than
bitter
no
thank
you
this
beer
costs
about
the
same
as
yona
yona
but
sucks
in
comparison
bass
served
well
as
one
of
the
intro
beers
to
the
world
of
craft
brewing
since
then
far
better
less
mass
produced
examples
exist
of
the
style
a
okay
beer
to
revisit
from
time
to
time
and
better
in
the
bottle
or
on
draught
in
my
opinion
still
one
of
the
converters
for
me
a
nice
beer
to
drink
w
a
meal
maybe
a
steak
or
something
this
is
one
of
the
more
common
beers
found
on
tap
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
its
a
copper
colored
beer
w
slight
head
smell
is
a
malty
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
nut
flavor
is
similar
it
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
of
harps
the
smell
was
grain
and
mild
floral
hops
not
much
going
on
there
the
taste
follows
up
similarly
grainy
with
a
bit
of
a
mild
bitterness
but
not
hugely
complex
it
was
carbonated
well
enough
at
least
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
i
could
down
a
few
with
food
and
friends
but
otherwise
its
merely
average
drinkable
and
refreshing
certainly
better
than
anything
from
ab
but
otherwise
an
average
beer
drinkability
was
pretty
good
im
glad
i
had
one
of
these
tonight
its
rare
that
you
get
a
beer
included
in
the
cost
of
a
dinner
at
a
nice
restaurant
and
this
was
definitely
the
best
they
had
to
offer
overall
im
rating
the
drinkability
fairly
low
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
for
the
other
five
might
have
been
drainpours
for
me
its
probably
a
good
bottled
beer
to
share
with
bmc
drinkers
but
the
lack
of
flavor
bothers
me
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
overall
a
pretty
interesting
pale
ale
likely
with
a
broad
range
of
appeal
also
the
price
is
right
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
recommended
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
pale
ale
but
a
tad
low
in
hop
aroma
and
flavor
areas
but
well
within
what
a
good
pale
ale
should
be
drinkability
is
spot
on

full

wont
claustrophobisize
you

leaving
just
a
few
spots
of

the
nose
is
nicely
full
of
barley
and

the

is

well
carbonated

by

pretty
well
and

is

is
very
nice
extremely

is
light

citric
the

water
with
some

the
mouthfeel
is
thin

watery
honestly
i
cant

how
this

i

rereviewd
on
08
oct
2005
ive
had
quite
a
few
other
english
pale
ales
since
this
original
review
in
2004
and
bass
while
dependable
is
bested
by
a
number
of
better
examples
of
the
style
its
quite
pleasant
good
looking
but
a
bit
of
a
lightweight
when
it
comes
to
taste
nice
flavor
not
overpowering
and
rather
subtle
with
just
a
hint
of
a
roasted
flavor
in
the
finish
nothing
ugly
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
at
all
i
like
to
lump
this
one
together
with
harp
and
smithwicks
since
i
think
all
of
them
taste
rather
similar
bass
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
but
overall
a
very
good
english
pale
ale
notes

from

about
a
week

and
the
bottled
foamed
over
upon
opening
a
gentle
pour
earned
a
three

that
hung
around
for
quite
a
while

more
in

i
expected
tastes
diacetyl

a
hop
that
comes
across
as
indecisive
the
aftertaste
sees
a
resurgence
of
the
butter
thats
diacteyl
in
case
you
didnt
know
in
a
stale
form
although
the
mouthfeel
in
medium
the
beer
has
a
thickness
on
the
tongue
but
its
almost
slick
and
unsettling
this
beer
is
not
good
im
hoping
this
was
a
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
give
it
another
try
at
some
point
in
the
future
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
acrid
on
the
tongue
detracts
from
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
decent

used
to
think
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
around

back
in
the
day
and
then
actually
found
the
good
stuff
since
then
i
havent
really
drank
any
bass
until
the
other
night
its
actually
pretty
decent
for
a
semimainstream
beer
appears
your
typical
tawny
amber
color
though
not
much

nice
clarity
though
and
the
smell
and
taste
are
fairly

there
is

in

is
a

overall
but
for
the
most
part
the
flavor
is
nothing
to
brag
about
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
it
has
a
surprising
fullness
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
remains
on
the
tongue
carbonation
is
a
bit
higher
than
medium
level
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
at
many
bars
with
limited
selections
of
drafts
there
are
many
places
that
it
ranks
among
the
one
or
two
best
on
the
menu
but
at
quality
beer
joints
you
wouldnt
think
about
ordering
bass
still
pricequality
wise
it
would
be
a
decent
session
beeras
long
as
there
are
no
bas
present
drinkability
i
think
this
has
a
bit
more
actual
flavor
than
the
bottle
but
it
seems
a
little
out
of
balance
or
character
still
not
as
drinkable
as
those
little
bottles
of
bass
when
served
on
tap
cheers
i
sometimes
buy
this
stuff
bottled
but
i
had
it
on
tap
recently
which
i
hadnt
had
the
opportunity
to
do
for
quite
some
time
anyway
the
tap
sample
of
this
amber
liquid
allowed
for
both
the
hop
aroma
and
malt
flavors
to
shine
through
ive
always
found
the
bottle
samples
to
be
a
bit
too
muted
the
aromas
seemed
quite
floral
to
me
and
mixed
well
with
some
medium
crystal
malt
notes
on
the
back
end
the
roles
were
reversed
on
the
tongue
with
the
rounded
malt
notes
taking
center
stage
and
the
hops
bringing
up
the
rear
good
balanced
mouthfeel
too
its
a
classic
session
ale
aroma
is
mild
sweet
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
pours
a
beautiful
copper
color
and
possesses
a
medium
white
frothy
head
with
excellent
lacing
flavor
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
moderate
bitter
finish
moderately
carbonated
and
maybe
just
a
touch
watery
but
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
balanced
pleasant
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
good
commonly
available
beer
opinion
well
this
isnt
too
bad
for
a
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
find
at
your
local
pub
it
is
by
far
not
my
favorite
english
ale
but
i
would
take
this
one
over
a
plethora
of
other
mass
produced
commercial
beers
i
loved
the
colour
of
this
beer
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
i
hoped
that
it
wouldnt
let
me
down
nose
is
typical
ale
smell
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
bitterness
is
near
perfect
not
too
much
very
mild
carbonation
goes
down
very
easily
and
if
i
knew
a
place
in
the
city
with
it
on
tap
id
definitely
want
to
give
this
one
a
try
it
would
be
a
wonderful
session
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
an
english
friend
gave
me
one
to
try
it
was
quite
different
from
what
im
normally
used
to
drinking
but
it
was
very
good
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
if
i
had
the
money
i
would
buy
it
again
not
much
more
to
say
then
whats
already
been
said
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
beer
while
on
tap
i
have
not
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
though
definatlty
reccomended
if
you
find
it
on
tap
the
head
stays
low
and
clings
to
your
pint
glass
and
the
mouth
feel
is
as
refreshing
as
can
be
for
a
pub
ale
i
have
a
new
appreciation
for
the
uniqueness
of
this
classic
had
not
had
this
beer
in
quite
some
time
looks
brightly
golden
copper
pours
a
slightly
tan
head
fairly
thick
lingers
and
laced
well
smells
mildly
malty
and
caramelly
hop
spice
balance
give
the
aroma
complexity
tastes
mallty
and
caramelly
as
well
mild
notes
of
dates
and
nuts
light
toasty
and
buttery
flavors
hide
behind
carbonation
and
hop
flavor
mild
ginger
and
clove
flavors
feels
moderately
creamy
and
peppery
to
the
toung
finishes
quite
light
with
low
lingering
bitterness
and
spiciness
not
as
flavorful
as
i
remembered
tasty
on
tap
would
like
to
try
other
serving
styles
and
compare
appearance
is
copper
color
topped
with
light
foamy
head
that
produced
little
lacing
aroma
consists
of
musty
yeast
and
bruised
apples
yuk
initial
taste
contains
a
minute
amount
of
bitter
hops
and
malt
those
danged
apples
again
followed
by
fruit
and
brown
sugar
this
undercarbonated
beer
leaves
a
nasty
taste
in
your
mouth
and
do
not
drink
it
warm
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
selling
well
a
really
decent
english
pale
ale
it
has
slight
hoppy
flavors
to
it
with
mild
undertones
of
honey
and
malts
as
a
stand
alone
this
is
a
crisp
beer
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
unique
subtle
european
hoppy
finish
over
all
recommened
as
a
beer
that
you
cant
go
wrong
with
really
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
big
foamy
head
excellent
head
retention
and
lacing
smell
of
herbal
hops
first
thing
i
taste
is
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
malt
malt
is
met
by
a
pleasant
mild
herbal
hop
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
tartness
in
the
background
that
adds
to
the
overall
bite
of
the
brew
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
cant
vouch
for
the
bottled
form
but
on
tap
bass
is
a
quintessential
english
pale
ale
that
is
a
bit
underrated
in
my
opinion
drinkability
have
had
this
several
times
before
i
will
go
to
this
one
because
its
usually
the
best
brew
a
bar
will
have
on
tap
at
times
decent
brew
here
big
creamcolored
head
full
of
explosions
leaving
foamy
clumps
of
lacing
the
beer
is
a
clear
redamber
nose
is
dusty
some
nutty
faintish
fruit
enh
front
is
fruity
and
a
little
spoonky
fruity
caramel
in
the
lightbodied
middle
finishes
nutty
and
fruity
not
bad
a
nice
light
pale
my
parents
always
have
a
6
of
these
in
thier
fridge
so
i
enjoyed
one
last
trip
home
very
clean
caramel
orange
color
nice
2
finger
head
that
retains
pretty
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
of
grains
and
a
little
citrus
tastes
pretty
refreshing
not
a
lot
going
on
otherwise
hop
flavor
is
present
but
not
overpowering
like
some
pale
ales
sweetens
up
a
little
toward
the
end
i
quite
enjoy
bass
i
dont
know
how
much
ill
buy
with
so
many
different
beers
out
there
ive
never
had
but
bass
is
a
solid
fall
back
among
my
favorite
beers
that
is
widely
available
even
though
the
style
is
not
among
my
favorites
crystaline
copper
pour
with
the
carbonation
visibly
sticking
at
the
head
of
a
mug
or
glass
frothy
white
head
that
completely
sheetslaces
any
glassware
slight
malt
sweetness
and
tones
of
fresh
sourdough
bread
that
are
best
had
off
of
tap
and
server
moderately
chilled
but
not
iced
bloody
florida
bars
dont
bother
out
of
the
bottle
please
and
goto
a
nice
place
for
fresh
taps
otherwise
youll
get
something
a
bit
wattery
and
dimmed
down
dissapointing
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
floral
hops
and
faint
simple
malts
taste
leans
towards
the
floral
resinous
hops
with
the
butterscotchy
malts
almost
but
not
quite
managing
to
balance
medium
bodied
with
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
quality
pale
ale
even
if
it
is
a
macro
and
ill
never
turn
my
nose
up
at
one
poured
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
purchased
on
sale
99
cents
at
the
north
coast
coop
in
arcata
california
looks
very
fine
in
my
lost
coast
pint
glass
body
is
bright
translucent
amber
the
head
is
frothy
whipped
thickness
offwhite
great
retention
that
leaves
some
thick
lace
patches
on
the
glass
smell
baked
red
delicious
apples
light
on
the
spice
pine
needles
slight
hint
of
fresh
grape
juice
behind
all
of
this
taste
upfront
twang
of
crisp
hops
that
take
their
time
twangin
before
some
buttery
notes
comes
through
toward
the
middle
along
with
a
slice
of
crisp
green
apple
aftertaste
is
an
unsalted
saltine
cracker
yeastiness
as
the
hop
twist
recedes
in
the
background
taking
its
time
mouthfeel
coats
my
palate
perfectly
a
chewy
even
silky
texture
that
provides
a
great
canvas
for
the
hearty
sturdy
flavors
carbonation
is
slight
but
spot
on
hey
this
aint
bad
pours
a
golden
orange
color
slightly
darker
than
the
average
english
pale
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
earthy
piney
hops
with
fruity
english
ale
yeast
not
spectacular
but
not
bad
either
taste
is
light
floral
hops
biscuit
like
malt
and
a
hint
of
fruit
apples
maybe
from
the
ale
yeast
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
and
very
little
bitterness
in
this
day
and
age
bass
is
not
very
unique
but
it
was
one
of
the
original
english
pales
so
you
have
to
give
it
some
respect
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
and
this
is
easily
a
great
session
beer
especially
if
youre
not
trying
to
burn
out
your
taste
buds
with
overly
hoppy
american
renditions
the
color
was
a
redish
amber
the
beer
was
poured
so
that
each
imperial
pint
was
all
beer
and
no
head
decent
lace
sweet
mix
of
malt
and
hops
aroma
smooth
and
crisp
good
malt
and
hops
taste
that
is
well
balanced
slighty
buttery
creamy
mouth
feel
with
a
very
good
aftertaste
i
truely
enjoyed
every
and
every
pint
of
bass
ale
pours
to
a
beautiful
reddish
anber
color
with
nice
big
head
i
smell
light
flower
and
moderate
amount
of
caramel
oily
in
texture
with
taste
being
earthy
and
caramel
but
neither
are
overwhelming
leaves
a
pleasent
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
pale
ale
is
more
subtle
than
other
pal
ales
ive
had
by
far
one
of
the
best
looking
and
clear
all
in
all
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
make
it
a
mainstay
the
bitter
hangs
around
dominantly
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
a
solution
would
be
never
stop
swallowing
i
suppose
im
torn
on
bass
pa
it
looks
great
smells
great
has
a
mouthfeel
of
quality
and
yet
it
is
a
little
out
of
balance
on
taste
it
needs
more
of
a
malt
flavor
to
attain
praise
from
me
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
very
little
scent
good
head
the
most
important
part
flaver
which
is
its
best
part
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
once
and
it
was
better
a
bottle
is
ok
but
pour
it
into
a
glass
it
is
better
not
the
best
with
popcorn
though
always
pours
golden
with
good
head
crisp
refreshing
flavor
with
a
bit
of
hops
a
bit
of
fruit
well
balanced
ale
and
always
consistant
and
always
good
final
conclusion
craft
pale
ales
like
magic
hat
and
sierra
nevada
make
this
one
look
awful
overall
impression
enjoyable
beer
that
makes
for
a
nice
session
great
gateway
beer
everyone
recognizes
the
name
and
logo
as
for
drinkability
very
good
when
its
warmed
up
a
bit
i
could
drink
4
or
5
without
noticing
but
the
sharper
flavor
it
has
when
its
cold
would
prevent
me
from
being
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
at
that
temperature
drinkability
i
was
one
of
my
premium
imported
i
ever
drank
that
time
it
was
still
enjoyable
to
drink
bass
again
but
the
beer
tastes
beer
when
warmer
than
usual
serving
temperature
a
solid
offering
with
excellent
availability
very
balanced
the
appearance
was
very
pale
without
any
head
whatsoever
the
smell
was
a
bouquet
of
flowers
with
slightly
over
ripe
fruit
the
taste
was
not
much
of
note
except
for
the
hops
which
came
through
and
provide
some
balance
for
heavily
laden
malts
however
it
was
slighty
flat
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
can
always
rely
upon
if
there
is
nothing
else
this
is
not
the
bass
i
remember
heck
its
not
even
brewed
in
burtonontrent
anymore
pours
a
orange
amber
color
with
a
pale
tan
head
nothing
to
get
excited
about
with
the
aroma
either
faint
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
caramel
i
used
to
enjoy
the
twang
from
the
hard
water
used
in
the
brewing
but
it
is
almost
nonexsistent
now
i
would
not
refuse
one
just
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
another
casualty
of
interbrew
dark
goldenorange
body
with
a
small
offkhaki
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
fruity
breadry
malt
aromas
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
a
faint
delicate
hop
backing
toasted
grain
and
biscuit
flavors
over
minerally
fruity
esters
gives
it
a
whiskeyish
character
light
hop
bitterness
combines
with
a
fruity
whiskey
burn
into
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
feel
not
bad
one
thing
that
can
be
very
exciting
about
this
beer
is
when
its
on
tap
8
times
out
of
10
its
just
about
the
same
everywhere
but
every
so
often
you
find
a
place
where
the
bass
is
delicious
at
the
round
the
clock
diner
near
3rd
ave
and
st
marks
in
manhattan
the
bass
has
been
delicious
every
time
ive
tried
it
at
that
place
id
rate
the
taste
a
5
had
this
at
the
miners
arms
in
eyan
england
said
to
be
the
home
of
the
black
plague
atmosphere
alone
made
this
beer
better
no
denying
that
the
golden
creamy
looking
brew
had
a
nice
cascading
head
as
it
was
pumped
from
the
cask
perfect
temperature
this
brew
is
a
whole
different
animal
over
here
starts
off
with
a
mild
apple
type
flavor
then
onto
a
full
creamy
body
that
coats
the
mouth
with
subtle
malt
and
a
tasty
butterscotch
diacetyl
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
like
a
cloud
in
the
mouth
and
i
could
no
doubt
doubt
drink
this
all
night
especially
in
a
tiny
village
with
some
locals
by
the
fire
in
a
17th
century
pub
what
a
treat
expected
a
better
tap
selection
but
bass
was
touted
by
a
recent
post
topic
and
i
was
curious
better
that
expected
would
select
it
over
the
other
macros
when
i
eat
there
again
or
maybe
go
across
town
and
have
a
duval
a
clean
golden
amber
beer
has
a
small
off
white
head
that
hangs
around
and
leaves
a
little
lace
the
aroma
has
a
solid
sweet
caramel
character
with
a
toffee
note
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
witha
light
sweet
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
caramel
a
light
dry
hoppiness
with
the
malt
sweetness
on
the
finish
makes
this
a
easy
going
session
beer
from
a
568
ml
bottle
pours
into
the
pint
glass
an
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
head
that
retains
throughout
but
leaves
little
lacing
smell
is
of
diacetyl
and
hop
spiciness
the
taste
delivers
this
plus
caramel
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
feels
decent
pretty
straightforward
but
good
id
still
take
good
ol
bass
over
a
good
many
other
however
so
thats
something
im
certain
bass
was
much
tastier
fifteen
years
ago
when
i
first
tried
it
its
also
a
better
beer
in
the
uk
than
in
the
us
here
its
a
poor
example
of
an
english
bitter
bass
has
been
a
go
to
brew
for
a
while
now
so
i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
review
i
like
the
appearance
a
nice
mix
of
copper
orange
and
gold
pours
with
a
nice
one
and
a
half
inch
head
that
reduces
to
a
beautiful
quater
inch
i
am
getting
a
skunky
nose
not
what
i
am
use
to
when
i
have
this
beer
on
tap
although
through
the
skunk
i
can
pick
up
some
spicy
hops
the
taste
is
kind
of
flat
first
some
sweet
maltiness
followed
by
a
hoppy
bite
just
what
i
would
expect
from
this
type
of
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
nice
and
slippery
with
the
right
amount
of
bubbles
for
some
reason
i
dont
know
what
it
is
i
have
never
been
able
to
drink
very
many
in
a
sitting
i
can
drink
a
couple
but
that
is
about
it
the
bass
pubpour
can
not
a
widgettype
nitrogenated
beer
just
charged
with
a
mix
of
carbon
dioxide
and
nitrogen
gases
pours
the
same
as
bass
but
with
a
soapier
head
im
not
going
to
get
into
nuances
of
the
beer
its
regular
old
bass
pale
ale
in
a
can
that
is
is
charged
during
canning
as
such
and
makes
no
significant
impact
on
heightening
the
beers
enjoyability
in
fact
the
further
metallic
taste
that
shows
up
in
the
can
is
rather
distracting
this
version
of
bass
seems
to
be
just
a
marketing
gimmick
preying
on
the
14
9
oz
widgetcan
phenomenon
it
has
not
impressed
me
whatsoever
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
as
it
quenches
your
thirst
it
also
goes
good
with
a
steak
dinner
label
states
since
1777
interbrew
uk
ltd
luton
england
nice
and
smooth
a
pretty
decent
session
brew
and
good
alternative
to
teh
macros
on
tap
all
over
town
having
consumed
this
beer
countless
times
before
it
is
about
time
that
i
enter
my
review
of
it
it
pours
a
golden
reddish
color
with
a
thin
head
on
top
the
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
but
without
much
to
rave
about
the
flavor
is
rich
with
sweet
malt
and
fruity
diacetyl
notes
it
is
a
bit
watery
at
the
end
with
little
in
the
hop
department
some
sourness
registers
as
well
it
is
clean
and
soft
on
the
palata
but
the
watery
end
of
it
makes
it
a
bit
less
desirable
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
there
is
nothing
better
around
like
in
a
bar
at
the
airport
if
by
some
freak
of
nature
you
havent
tried
bass
assuming
you
arent
religiously
opposed
to
it
give
it
a
try
its
a
damn
fine
drink
bass
is
a
great
session
beer
apparently
its
a
shade
of
what
it
once
was
but
still
a
very
tastey
balanced
beer
around
a
while
below
average
would
prefer
club
soda
this
beer
is
absolute
rubbish
all
in
all
a
good
pale
ale
pours
medium
reddishamber
a
very
nice
color
nice
carbonation
1
finger
of
head
that
has
decent
retention
not
much
coming
in
from
the
nose
a
bit
of
malt
hops
and
hints
of
sweetness
taste
is
very
nice
i
was
expected
a
more
watery
ale
flavor
but
bass
has
got
a
rather
full
body
that
isnt
overly
hoppy
nor
alcoholy
a
nice
balance
of
the
flavors
with
moderate
malt
and
bitterness
along
with
a
creamy
sweet
background
that
makes
the
entire
brew
quite
smooth
a
very
drinkable
popular
beer
the
venerable
bass
pale
ale
it
might
not
be
very
extreme
for
a
pale
ale
but
it
certainly
is
drinkable
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
has
a
nice
white
head
that
it
retains
well
and
it
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
my
glass
there
is
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
nice
crisp
malty
aroma
nothing
exciting
but
good
nonetheless
it
has
a
very
mild
flavor
again
nothing
extreme
but
it
is
very
pleasing
to
drink
it
definitely
is
a
great
session
beer
it
is
an
all
around
decent
british
pale
ale
and
it
is
no
wonder
it
has
remained
so
popular
since
its
creation
taste
was
of
sweet
toffee
with
a
dry
floral
aftertaste
well
blended
flavor
but
its
still
an
average
beer
in
my
book
paid
4
40
for
a
22oz
glass
tried
bass
many
a
times
in
my
day
but
not
in
the
past
six
months
to
recall
its
qualities
a
bit
overrated
in
my
book
nice
mouthfeel
for
a
pale
ale
poured
an
average
head
and
carbonation
no
real
lacing
finished
it
off
fine
a
bit
hoppy
but
not
any
more
than
a
typical
pale
ale
okay
at
best
this
is
a
beer
that
doesnt
give
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
quite
booring
but
very
drinkable
pours
out
a
reddish
sort
of
cross
between
crimson
and
orange
very
small
whitish
head
that
quickly
dissipates
nothing
particularly
wonderful
the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
not
very
strong
something
of
understated
malt
and
a
sweet
fruity
currant
other
berry
scent
dominates
taste
is
soso
it
is
an
acquired
taste
in
my
opinion
strong
hops
right
up
front
with
a
sweet
finish
that
slowly
switches
to
a
dry
tanginess
at
the
end
fairly
complex
but
not
something
i
would
consider
all
that
wonderful
mouthfeel
is
actually
one
of
this
offerings
stronger
suits
perhaps
a
little
overcarbonated
but
still
manages
to
have
enough
substance
for
my
personal
preferences
also
fairly
true
to
the
style
drinkability
is
soso
i
usually
buy
a
sixpack
of
bass
pale
ale
about
every
2
years
good
pale
ale
this
used
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
when
dining
out
its
still
good
but
i
am
finding
more
and
more
better
beers
out
there
with
my
expanding
understanding
of
styles
and
expectations
of
a
style
i
will
have
to
be
mindful
of
the
differences
between
epa
apa
and
ipa
in
the
future
so
although
at
first
it
seemed
it
would
be
a
disappointment
the
result
is
a
beer
that
has
found
its
way
to
high
place
in
my
personal
rankings
very
nice
beer
to
have
a
few
pitchers
of
overalla
superb
ale
doesnt
seem
like
it
gets
enough
recognition
on
here
sometimes
but
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
do
better
a
fantastic
session
beer
to
enjoy
good
moments
with
only
drawback
is
its
slightly
expensive
but
arent
many
good
beers
these
days
highly
recommended
from
me
this
beer
came
off
the
tap
an
golden
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
to
sit
atop
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
sweet
with
hints
of
honey
covered
caramel
the
flavor
is
odd
to
me
it
is
very
sweet
almost
fruity
with
a
really
bad
tang
on
the
finish
there
is
also
a
metallic
flavor
in
there
i
dont
really
like
it
the
feel
is
moderate
somewhat
creamy
but
nothing
special
really
the
drnkability
is
just
okay
the
flavor
takes
away
a
bit
from
the
beer
overall
poured
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
head
aroma
malty
citrus
nutty
flavor
was
on
the
weak
side
lighty
sweet
citrus
brown
sugar
hints
of
hops
and
malts
with
some
bittness
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
the
type
you
can
serve
to
impress
the
people
you
know
who
drink
bud
the
body
is
decent
and
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
bass
pale
ale
is
a
beer
that
lives
fondly
in
memory
but
i
wont
let
that
influence
this
review
when
consumed
with
an
open
and
newly
expanded
mind
and
palate
it
just
isnt
that
good
would
it
do
in
a
pinch
sure
but
when
my
local
stores
carry
dozens
of
beers
that
are
better
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
again
the
aroma
is
bready
and
yeasty
with
a
fruit
undertone
the
taste
is
much
the
same
there
are
traces
of
crackers
and
wheat
bread
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
there
are
hints
of
spiced
apple
in
the
flavor
as
well
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
that
has
a
distinct
flavor
drinkability
is
good
for
bass
and
the
overall
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
quite
acceptable
i
think
the
balance
between
sweetness
and
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
is
well
controlled
a
solid
choice
when
faced
with
limited
options
at
your
typical
restaurant
or
pub
in
the
states
i
cant
believe
that
ive
never
rated
this
classic
this
along
with
snpa
and
boston
lager
were
the
3
beers
that
introduced
me
to
this
world
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
large
head
that
is
full
of
craters
smell
is
of
sweet
carmelish
malt
taste
is
full
of
bready
malt
accented
by
sweet
carmel
it
also
has
a
mild
burnt
toast
flavor
very
little
hop
aroma
or
taste
a
decent
session
beer
and
nice
to
have
once
in
awhile
but
better
can
definately
be
had
kind
of
a
murky
red
colour
with
a
light
tiny
bubbled
head
very
little
lace
stayed
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
malt
bit
of
grass
some
hops
and
mineral
water
taste
is
more
complex
with
minerals
than
any
actual
beer
ingredient
their
is
a
decent
hard
water
taste
too
this
which
detracts
from
any
hop
or
malt
profile
malt
is
quite
dull
weakened
just
a
light
sweetness
hops
are
more
grassy
and
again
dull
and
overpowered
by
minerals
used
overall
a
full
body
mouthfeel
bit
thick
and
nice
quite
refreshing
though
not
incredibly
enjoyable
clear
amber
coloured
beer
topped
with
a
thin
white
lace
fruity
banana
aroma
with
a
light
hoppiness
and
biscuity
bready
maltiness
definite
diacetyl
flavour
and
buttery
texture
nice
bitterness
at
the
base
of
the
flavour
along
with
some
fruity
esters
and
caramel
malt
mediumlight
body
and
lightly
carbonated
with
a
bit
of
co2
bite
at
the
finish
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
that
lingers
a
good
beer
to
drink
while
watching
monty
pythons
flying
circus
normally
i
dont
have
this
beer
unless
it
is
paired
with
guinness
in
a
black
and
tan
or
harp
but
it
is
good
to
have
it
on
its
own
i
nice
mild
smell
with
some
sweetness
goes
along
with
the
nice
brown
color
the
first
swallow
is
smooth
and
malty
going
down
easily
not
too
carbonated
and
the
aftertaste
is
more
mild
maltiness
and
caramel
overall
a
very
good
beer
to
have
around
next
time
i
should
drop
the
black
and
just
have
the
tan
easily
consumable
and
light
on
the
palate
plus
you
can
find
this
virtually
anywhere
plenty
of
other
epas
id
rather
be
drinking
bottled
canadian
import

cleanly
with

after
taste
a
mild

that
is
very
drinkable
completely
different
in

form
in
the
uk
but
thats
another
story
sheep
in

cloth
a
little
suprised
by
this
you
see
it
everywhere
so
you
think
it
will
be
below
par
far
from
it
while
not
great
a
solid
offering
pours
a
dark
orangebrownish
with
a
off
white
2
inch
thick
head
the
head
fizzles
down
but
still
impressive
lacing
is
average
the
taste
is
a
fruity
hint
of
huckleberry
slight
grainy
bread
notes
throughout
the
sweet
sugar
molasses
is
light
and
refreshing
hops
are
slight
but
noticable
and
bring
a
nice
balance
to
the
beer
still
seems
a
little
lackluster
however
the
aroma
is
of
sugared
grain
almost
brown
roasted
sugar
the
toasted
grains
are
pleasant
light
to
medium
bodied
for
a
pale
not
bad
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
beer
with
a
medium
head
carbonation
is
on
the
weak
side
aroma
is
a
nice
enough
mix
of
malt
taste
is
very
classic
english
ale
and
ends
with
some
medium
bitterness
very
well
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
bitterness
i
guess
this
is
a
very
decent
if
unspectacular
drink
one
of
the
classic
regular
available
imports
a
solid
english
pale
ale
overll
it
was
not
bad
but
there
are
better
ways
to
spend
your
time
bass
is
always
a
good
standby
and
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
looking
to
get
away
from
us
macrobrews
theres
nothing
thrilling
here
just
comforting
had
this
ontap
tonight
for
the
first
time
and
really
enjoyed
it
appearance
is
a
nice
light
amber
with
an
average
sized
somewhat
thick
head
smell
is
pretty
standard
mainly
malt
smell
noted
taste
isnt
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
has
somewhat
of
a
honey
finish
very
enjoyable
a
perfect
easytodrink
yet
very
tasty
beer
will
definently
have
this
beer
again
overall
this
is
the
classic
english
pale
ale
and
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
its
nothing
special
and
is
middleoftheroad
all
the
way
and
although
a
little
overpriced
this
beer
is
very
accessible
and
drinkable
and
offers
a
great
alternative
to
the
macrolagers
for
rather
novice
beer
drinkers
ive
been
drinking
bass
for
a
few
years
now
but
it
was
last
year
that
i
really
started
appreciating
it
pours
out
a
light
brown
color
with
half
an
inch
of
head
the
smell
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
but
its
not
bad
either
just
nothing
that
stands
out
about
it
you
can
really
taste
the
hops
they
give
it
a
nice
clean
smooth
taste
great
balance
with
the
malts
too
it
goes
down
great
without
being
too
heavy
or
too
light
an
above
average
wellbalanced
enjoyable
beer
with
a
bit
of
an
oldfashioned
character
to
it
final
thought
pleasent
better
on
tap
than
poured
from
the
bottle
a
fine
pale
ale
in
my
book
thick
deep
head
light
amber
color
floral
hop
scent
very
soft
on
the
palate
with
a
very
mellow
hop
flavor
and
limited
bitterness
very
basic
pale
ale
single
minimamal
hop
aroma
flavor
and
bite
finishes
quickly
leaves
hardly
any
aftertaste
brown
12oz
overall
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
beer
id
expect
a
better
body
to
the
beer
and
a
flavour
packing
more
of
a
punch
a
good
beer
to
have
more
than
one
of
by
itself
with
food
id
get
too
fuuulll
this
might
make
a
good
starting
point
for
those
interested
in
pale
ale
but
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
weaker
examples
character
not
overall
quality
i
prefer
a
serious
i
p
a
but
this
is
by
no
means
bad
ill
be
looking
for
it
on
tap
in
the
near
future
just
an
average
beer
it
was
light
to
intermediate
in
depth
of
the
amber
coloration
there
was
a
nice
head
which
did
last
the
duration
of
the
pint
there
was
nothing
in
the
smell
or
taste
areas
to
be
excited
about
unfortunately
this
beer
is
far
to
prevalent
as
an
alternative
to
american
macros
bass
reach
for
greatness
thats
their
new
radio
ad
thats
played
everyday
so
am
i
reaching
for
greatness
not
really
appearance
is
nice
though
poured
out
a
dark
amber
color
quite
dark
for
a
pale
ale
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
subdued
a
lot
some
malts
in
there
with
some
earth
tones
and
some
hops
but
not
very
much
taste
was
on
the
light
side
too
malts
start
out
and
last
all
the
way
through
then
mixed
with
some
hops
and
buttery
tones
in
the
middle
that
lasts
through
the
end
it
was
balanced
but
too
light
and
thin
have
this
beer
on
tap
tight
off
white
head
clear
light
amber
in
the
glass
nose
is
relatively
tame
with
some
mild
sweet
maltiness
and
very
little
hop
presence
the
taste
is
light
to
medium
maltiness
decent
but
wimpy
hop
bitterness
and
some
fruitiness
with
that
bass
yeast
estery
flavor
finishes
light
and
refreshing
a
very
tame
pale
ale
yet
very
good
for
session
imbibing
i
have
to
laugh
everytime
i
see
the
i
p
a
designation
on
the
label
a
good
beginners
ale
easy
to
get
here
but
very
mediocre
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
date
on
it
a
nice
one
finger
offwhite
head
with
an
ample
amount
of
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
the
beer
is
a
nice
orangish
copper
color
floral
hops
are
first
noticed
upon
initial
whiff
a
medium
bodied
mildly
bittered
pale
that
finishes
somewhat
dry
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
a
very
decent
beer
but
nothing
eye
opening
really
good
color
and
a
good
head
nothing
in
the
way
of
lacing
taste
is
nice
sweet
but
a
little
off
i
dont
know
what
i
dont
like
about
it
but
there
is
surely
something
maybe
the
sweetness
alot
of
sweet
malt
going
on
in
the
taste
and
the
smell
just
a
hint
of
hops
on
the
aftertaste
pours
a
bronze
clear
liquid
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
head
disappears
fairly
quickly
there
is
very
little
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
somewhat
mild
cant
really
pinpoint
anything
taste
slightly
of
toasted
malt
a
little
caramel
with
a
very
dry
hop
finish
hop
finish
seems
somewhat
flowery
not
really
citrusy
a
little
thin
in
body
but
overall
not
too
bad
i
find
this
to
be
an
old
standby
if
there
is
only
macros
to
compete
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
session
beer
and
wonder
what
it
is
like
oversees
or
possibly
from
a
cask
a
decent
pale
ale
certainly
not
the
best
definitely
historical
though
and
why
was
burton
built
on
trent
easy
beer
to
drink
i
used
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
but
the
more
craft
beer
i
drink
the
higher
my
standards
get
definitly
much
better
than
a
bud
or
miller
drinkability
a
great
light
beer
for
those
hot
days
sitting
around
the
lake
ng
the
subdued
characteristics
of
this
beer
make
it
inoffensive
but
not
necessarily
one
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
i
think
my
memories
of
this
beer
are
the
stuff
of
nostalgiathey
just
dont
live
up
to
the
reality
this
is
one
of
the
beers
i
keep
around
all
the
time
pours
a
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
around
the
smell
in
limited
to
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
much
a
english
ale
flavor
with
a
bit
of
a
sensen
and
carmel
light
on
the
mouth
and
easy
to
drink
even
at
the
price
i
enjoy
at
least
one
a
day
i
would
recomend
this
to
my
friends
as
an
intro
to
finer
beers
hmm
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
bass
and
there
seems
to
have
been
a
steep
drop
off
in
quality
since
my
last
taste
it
pours
a
medium
orangeamber
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
but
its
all
downhill
from
there
the
smell
is
scant
with
some
barely
perceptible
light
caramel
theres
some
good
caramel
flavor
with
a
bit
of
tea
like
hops
for
balance
but
its
too
thin
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
just
one
step
above
a
domestic
macro
the
bass
poured
a
nice
rich
amber
with
a
good
finger
of
head
that
held
firm
it
smelled
overwhelmingly
of
alcohol
with
slight
tinges
of
hops
and
spice
the
taste
was
almost
entirely
hops
and
alcohol
the
feel
was
light
bodied
and
slightly
oily
i
could
only
take
one
of
these
while
ive
had
worse
beers
it
was
not
enjoyable
and
i
switched
on
my
next
round
my
dad
liked
it
and
he
is
an
avowed
lager
drinker
so
its
appealing
to
many
different
people
i
think
it
pours
a
head
about
two
fingers
tall
with
a
light
tan
color
it
is
reduced
pretty
quickly
but
the
lacing
follows
the
beer
all
the
way
through
tasty
malty
beer
with
sweet
aromas
and
some
burnt
aromas
as
well
as
roasted
tastes
light
hop
taste
very
smooth
on
your
tongue
and
goes
down
smooth
as
well
leaves
a
nice
caramel
after
taste
ive
had
this
brew
before
both
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
though
i
just
had
a
few
pints
from
the
fox
and
hound
here
in
the
dallasarea
and
decided
to
review
it
the
appearance
is
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
that
ended
up
settling
down
to
a
thin
line
around
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
pleasing
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
the
taste
was
smooth
and
for
a
lack
of
a
better
description
very
balanced

i
usually
find
myself
in

after
all
though
ive
thought
of
it
as
being
red
in
color
i
am
not
one
to
bemoan
the
past
but
this
beer
is
definitely
one
that
is
but
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
circa
78
years
ago
much
better
on
draft
but
it
has
a
long
way
to
go
to
be
great
again
as
englands
first
registered
trademark
it
is
no
wonder
why
this
ale
has
lasted
as
long
as
it
has
it
is
consistant
and
very
drinkable
the
slight
bitterness
is
nothing
but
welcomed
with
the
fruity
undertones
and
ohsoslight
caramel
flavor
pours
a
amber
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
the
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
leaving
spots
on
the
surface
the
aroma
is
slightly
dull
as
some
malt
and
fruitiness
is
detected
the
taste
is
of
malt
and
bitterness
which
is
balanced
some
fruit
tones
are
detectable
the
bitterness
seems
to
arrive
a
little
stronger
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
not
as
flavorful
as
some
other
pales
but
very
drinkable
this
is
the
usual
restaurant
choice
when
beer
menu
is
lacking
nothing
earth
shattering
but
this
pint
exceeded
my
expectations
in
the
world
of
macros
a
good
beer
but
nothing
terribly
special
bass
gets
a
huge
nod
from
me
as
an
excellent
session
beer
goes
well
with
food
and
even
my
wife
likes
it
thin
creamy
colored
head
with
thick
dense
bubbles
clear
brilliant
amberorange
color
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
peated
malt
kinda
has
a
slight
scotch
flavor
to
it
very
good
slightly
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
good
palate
cleansing
carbonation
couldnt
detect
any
hops
very
well
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
character
excellent
session
beer
and
available
in
most
places
beats
all
the
standard
offerings
in
your
typical
restaurant
wow
drunk
on
cask
in
the
uk
bass
is
a
completely
different
ale
firstly
the
alcohol
by
volume
drops
from
5
0
to
4
0
the
amazing
thing
is
you
get
much
more
flavor
from
this
4
0
version
than
you
do
from
the
stateside
one
the
colour
is
a
nice
cascading
yellow
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aromas
are
of
biscuits
bready
malts
and
faint
hops
the
taste
is
biscuity
and
bready
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
and
good
and
the
drinkability
you
may
ask
well
i
was
drinking
one
waiting
for
my
flight
to
be
called
and
it
was
called
right
after
i
ordered
this
so
i
drank
it
all
in
one
go
backdated
tasting
i
first
reviewed
this
beer
on
19jun03
this
post
is
based
on
notes
from
that
review
poured
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
stay
long
nice
initial
hop
wood
malt
bouquet
first
taste
had
a
nice
carmel
tinge
full
and
smooth
but
that
seemed
to
fade
rather
quickly
it
seemed
to
get
dry
and
well
ordinary
as
it
went
along
no
bad
aftertaste
drinkable
but
not
bragable
a
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
when
poured
developed
a
thick
rough
foamy
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
as
it
dissipated
it
left
some
thin
lace
around
the
glass
pale
orange
body
with
decent
carbonation
little
to
nonexistent
hop
aroma
and
no
distinctive
smell
hop
bitteness
was
however
much
stonger
than
the
smell
sugessted
good
taste
but
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
this
style
some
sour
aftertaste
that
was
a
bit
funky
i
bought
a
12
pack
so
it
was
not
spoilage
nicely
drinkable
but
somewhat
unexceptional
ale
could
have
used
a
dose
of
character
other
i
remember
bass
being
quite
hoppy
and
pale
what
no
talent
ass
clown
messed
it
up
they
say
this
beer
has
lost
a
lot
of
charactor
sice
they
adapted
the
new
brewing
system
although
i
never
has
hte
pleasure
of
appreciating
the
original
i
had
my
share
of
this
one
pours
with
a
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
diminishes
into
a
white
lace
aroma
is
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
well
balanced
by
the
subtle
hops
light
in
body
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
and
one
of
the
first
good
beers
that
i
drank
on
a
regular
basis
rubyamber
in
color
with
a
decent
sized
thick
creamy
head
that
tracks
the
sides
of
the
glass
to
the
end
faint
buttery
and
roasted
aromas
with
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
same
as
the
smells
but
more
pronounced
buttery
roasted
nutty
flavor
of
malts
with
a
kiss
of
hops
and
a
mineral
component
as
well
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
as
a
session
beer
probably
the
standard
for
good
euro
pale
ales
a
solid
brew
all
around
i
dont
order
it
as
much
as
i
used
to
but
its
usually
a
safe
bet
to
be
on
tap
in
most
barseateries
theres
a
nice
brownruby
colour
here
mine
was
poured
with
absolutely
no
head
hopefully
this
was
the
bartenders
ignorance
as
everything
else
about
the
beer
was
just
fine
not
too
complex
overall
but
there
are
traces
of
butter
a
nice
maltiness
some
caramel
and
hints
of
hoppiness
her
eand
there
why
this
was
ever
pushed
as
an
i
p
a
is
beyond
me
because
it
certainly
not
one
definitely
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
very
little
difference
in
the
taste
in
the
us
versus
the
uk
which
holds
rue
for
most
pale
ales
i
use
bass
as
a
benchmark
for
the
style
and
it
really
deserves
that
position
despite
being
so
mass
produced
the
presentation
always
in
a
english
pint
glass
is
a
nice
medium
copper
color
with
a
a
head
that
stays
pretty
much
to
the
end
of
the
pint
the
aroma
is
quite
average
for
the
style
and
while
it
says
pale
ale
it
is
not
too
strong
the
mouth
has
fairly
good
body
and
the
finsh
is
clearly
hoppy
with
a
slightly
sour
aftertaste
there
are
hoppier
brew
for
those
who
wantb
but
you
are
pretty
safe
ordering
a
bass
no
matter
where
you
go
this
was
a
decent
beer
the
first
half
of
the
beer
was
the
best
but
as
i
drank
more
it
seemed
as
though
the
taste
got
worse
i
enjoyed
the
fist
half
as
i
said
you
can
taste
hops
but
not
much
of
them
i
was
expecting
more
for
the
pale
ale
lot
of
malt
actually
the
malt
kind
of
tasted
grainy
in
the
second
half
a
decent
brew
by
no
means
a
bad
brew
i
would
definitely
buy
this
when
there
is
nothing
else
i
often
drink
a
lot
of
bass
at
pubs
restaurants
bars
etc
its
tasty
not
overly
expensive
and
usually
readily
available
this
was
the
first
time
i
ever
tried
bass
in
a
bottle
and
i
must
say
its
nowhere
near
as
good
the
bottled
version
seemed
much
lighter
and
cripser
than
the
ontap
version
with
much
less
of
the
flavor
a
bitter
wheaty
taste
much
of
what
i
detected
but
it
too
disappeared
fairly
quickly
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
pours
a
real
nice
amber
colour
with
a
lovely
smell
the
nose
silentsabre
had
this
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
hangs
around
a
little
while
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
malts
i
didnt
notice
much
else
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
nuttyness
about
it
possibly
some
caramel
in
there
too
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
not
too
much
character
but
an
enjoyable
drink
12
oz
bottle
labeled
bottled
and
brewed
by
interbrew
ltd
i
guess
the
budweiser
of
europe
will
eventually
own
all
of
the
major
labels
the
color
of
this
beer
is
the
color
that
comes
to
mind
when
one
mentions
english
pale
ale
a
rich
goldenamber
with
a
fine
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
caramel
touched
with
a
subtle
woody
hop
smell
it
has
a
crisp
fruity
flavor
in
which
is
well
balanced
between
malt
and
a
medium
level
of
hop
bitterness
i
think
it
is
a
bit
underhopped
though
the
mouthfeel
is
average
for
a
beer
of
this
alchohol
level
i
have
to
admit
i
didnt
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
theres
just
a
hint
of
an
odd
aftertaste
to
it
on
the
other
hand
it
has
this
wonderfully
dark
color
and
pours
out
a
fairly
lovely
head
a
nice
strong
smell
adds
to
the
whole
experience
it
looks
good
smells
good
but
i
think
theres
something
lacking
from
the
end
a
bit
of
a
dissapointment
but
maybe
my
hopes
were
set
too
high
for
this
one
while
not
a
world
beater
this
is
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
beer
and
one
that
i
would
not
turn
down
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
hurry
which
is
good
for
me
and
bad
for
my
bank
account
amber
colored
fruity
with
a
malty
nose
this
is
still
a
nice
english
beer
in
the
bottle
drank
it
years
ago
on
cask
in
the
u
k
and
the
modern
version
has
lost
a
bit
of
its
spunk
this
bottled
version
still
retains
some
of
the
qualities
of
old
it
holds
a
nice
head
throughouti
drink
vairly
quickly
and
its
slightly
sweet
taste
is
no
problem
to
my
taste
buds
highly
drinkable
stuff
rich
amber
in
appearance
thin
white
head
a
bass
is
what
i
think
about
when
i
picture
a
glass
of
beer
almost
toffeeish
fruity
smell
to
it
hint
of
something
burnt
maybe
toasted
is
a
better
word
but
i
dont
think
so
fruit
comes
out
mid
taste
with
some
carmel
butteriness
hops
to
finish
a
nice
beer
for
all
occasions
one
of
those
beers
you
can
find
almost
anywhere
that
will
satisfy
notes
not
worth
your
time
many
compare
their
pale
ales
to
this
this
isnt
groundbreaking
anymore
but
it
still
is
a
beer
that
is
welcome
in
my
fridge
anytime
very
easy
to
drink
makes
a
great
session
beer
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
start
a
macroer
conversion
this
is
would
go
great
with
red
meat
of
any
kind
especially
steaks
and
prime
rib
this
brew
pours
a
light
brown
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
white
bubbles
it
has
a
nice
transparent
golden
brown
body
a
mild
malty
aroma
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
it
has
an
initially
bitter
taste
that
quickly
melds
into
a
smooth
slightly
bitter
hoppy
malty
finish
this
brew
has
a
little
more
character
than
some
of
my
recent
ratings
it
is
a
nice
all
around
drinkable
brew
a
classic
epa
that
back
in
the
day
was
a
special
occasion
beer
for
me
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
imo
nice
clean
taste
not
too
much
hoppiness
with
a
buttery
feel
this
is
the
beer
i
bring
to
parties
when
i
dont
want
to
share
my
stash
always
drinkable
i
will
never
turn
one
of
these
down
a
clean
amber
colored
appearance
with
a
light
head
and
body
the
malt
used
in
this
beer
has
a
roasted
quality
caramelly
flavor
and
also
hoppy
just
enough
bitterness
at
the
end
to
keep
this
beer
from
being
overly
malty
mouthfeel
is
good
and
maybe
a
bit
oily
but
smooth
this
is
a
great
session
beer
with
low
abv
and
lots
of
character
the
beer
that
made
me
want
to
know
more
beyond
the
borders
of
american
macros
it
has
a
quality
taste
that
i
still
admire
even
after
i
have
tried
so
many
other
beers
now
bass
comes
forth
with
a
slick
butteryness
that
is
followed
by
some
malty
tones
caramel
buttterscotch
the
finish
is
of
slight
hop
bitterness
that
makes
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
a
true
classic
brown
amber
in
color
not
much
of
a
head
but
foam
never
disappeared
completely
malty
odor
with
a
slight
caramel
scent
nice
full
mouthfeel
taste
starts
off
as
a
duel
between
caramely
malt
flavor
and
a
mineral
water
taste
presumably
the
muchbalyhooed
burtonontrent
water
before
finishing
with
a
mildly
hoppy
aftertaste
i
could
probably
put
away
a
number
of
these
while
not
earthshattering
its
not
bad
at
all
taste
was
somewhat
sweet
and
lacking
the
bitterness
at
the
finish
carbonation
kind
of
got
in
the
way
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
smooth
beer
missing
the
bitter
aftertaste
of
some
other
bitters
ive
had
in
the
past
no
complaints
here
overall
i
will
not
buy
bass
however
if
one
is
offered
i
will
not
turn
it
down
slightly
above
average
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
very
good
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
malty
and
very
sweet
slightly
too
sweet
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warms
the
balance
between
hop
and
malt
becomes
better
there
are
some
mild
fruit
flavors
to
the
beer
but
nothing
overhwhelming
definately
a
good
beer
for
drinking
while
camping
or
during
the
summer
on
the
porch
light
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
nice

taste
good

milder
taste
as
typical
of
english
ales
good
flavor
full
round
mouthfeel
smooth
taste
finish
is
clean
and

is
dry
and

pours
a
medium
white
head
with
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
carbonation
was
observed
rising
to
the
top
its
body
was
amber
it
had
a
somewhat
fruity
aroma
to
it
there
was
no
bitterness
noted
it
had
a
nice
flavor
which
i
was
surprised
at
there
was
no
aftertaste
with
this
brew
not
a
bad
drink
beautiful
amber
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
subsides
quickly
unless
you
pour
it
exactly
right
fine
bubbles
complement
the
hard
water
character
which
allow
the
smooth
malt
to
blend
with
the
noble
hops
if
you
are
used
to
light
beers
this
one
can
be
nicely
hoppy
but
to
most
i
p
a
lovers
the
hops
are
mild
at
best
a
wonderful
brew
in
the
classic
english
pale
ale
style
that
is
best
served
not
too
cold
good
for
summer
days
while
reading
on
the
hammock
in
the
backyard
even
though
i
tried
both
guinness
and
bass
tonight
i
didnt
get
to
try
a
black
and
tan
i
had
this
beer
in
a
22oz
glass
on
tap
it
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
about
1
5
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
a
bit
of
pine
to
the
smell
and
a
little
hops
the
taste
is
also
piney
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
a
good
hops
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
great
starter
pale
ale
i
had
this
last
night
while
the
memory
of
the
cask
conditioned
bass
that
i
had
in
england
ws
fresh
in
my
mind
there
was
a
big
difference
in
the
beers
the
us
version
lacked
a
smoothness
that
was
in
the
cask
version
also
the
us
version
has
somewhat
of
an
indeterminate
aftertaste
that
was
not
evident
in
the
cask
version
all
in
all
still
a
very
good
brew
put
it
is
lacking
compared
to
its
big
brother
an
impressive
copperyamber
colour
it
was
served
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
disappeared
shortly
but
left
a
bit
of
lace
down
the
glass
during
consumption
brief
note
of
malts
on
the
nose
before
the
hops
took
over
and
the
taste
matched
this
a
decent
session
beer
ive
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
it
but
on
tap
if
given
the
choice
id
rather
drink
a
good
local
micro
otherwise
i
use
this
to
fall
back
on
and
it
never
does
me
wrong
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
really
got
me
interested
in
the
different
tastes
and
varieties
of
beer
and
for
that
reason
alone
will
probably
always
be
one
of
my
favorites
it
pours
a
nice
coppery
redamber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
which
slowly
diminishes
this
beer
looks
good
and
inviting
slightly
hoppy
floral
nose
tastes
of
hops
although
fairly
mild
and
slightly
metallic
the
hops
provide
a
nice
tingle
on
the
tongue
smooth
and
fairly
light
bass
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
high
availability
this
is
a
good
backup
beer
pretty
available
and
consistently
decent
but
not
exceptional
it
tastes
better
to
me
out
of
the
bottle
than
on
tap
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
i
wish
would
stick
around
longer
leaves
good
lacing
though
which
sticks
to
the
glass
and
doesnt
move
the
malt
smell
comes
through
immediately
plus
some
hop
and
a
bit
of
pine
and
citrus
the
taste
is
also
malty
and
has
highlights
of
orange
peel
and
pine
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
feels
like
it
foams
up
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
lingering
aftertaste
has
a
metallic
flavor
though
which
detracts
from
the
other
flavors
and
makes
it
hard
to
have
more
of
all
the
light
classic
ales
this
is
the
one
i
like
the
best
now
i
know
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
good
and
it
is
very
refreshing
i
see
bass
as
a
good
beer
to
end
the
night
with
not
heavy
and
lower
alcohol
i
know
bass
has
to
be
better
than
this
but
it
wasnt
ok
so
its
my
favorite
beer
ive
had
some
of
the
worlds
best
but
bass
flavor
is
second
to
none
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
watered
down
if
it
was
a
little
stronger
it
would
be
too
good
to
be
true
perfect
color
perfect
roasted
flavor
even
if
you
have
to
concentrate
on
it
they
say
its
not
the
same
beer
napoleon
cherished
but
so
what
i
love
it
to
death
copper
in
color
fruit
biscuity
grain
and
butterscoth
aromas
that
worked
quite
nicely
together
flavor
was
that
of
diacetyl
with
a
subdued
sweetness
and
moderately
strong
biscuit
moderatelight
bitterness
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
and
a
nice
diversion
very
drinkable
and
a
bar
favorite
i
told
them
to
change
the
temp
on
that
line
was
far
to
cold
kinda
ruined
it
a
bit
compared
to
other
times
ive
had
it
presented
in
a
1
pint
3
25
oz
bottle
bright
amber
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
with
pretty
decent
retension
slight
floral
hop
aroma
but
overall
not
much
smell
at
all
soft
malt
flavors
to
start
balanced
by
the
hops
for
the
most
part
the
malt
rules
and
in
my
opinion
it
could
use
more
hops
as
a
pale
ale
i
am
not
impressed
with
this
brew
as
it
lacks
the
crispness
and
the
hoppy
deliciousness
it
is
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
light
body
and
balanced
flavor
i
would
recommend
it
but
not
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
a
pale
ale
the
taste
first
comes
at
you
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
quicky
finishes
with
a
minor
hoppy
bitterness
no
lingering
after
taste
just
a
smooth
tasting
pale
ale
recomended
off
the
pour
we
got
a
nice
big
head
white
and
fluffy
sticks
all
over
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
nice
looking
amber
color
its
got
a
nice
sweet
flavor
to
it
with
a
nice
dose
of
hops
seems
like
a
pretty
standard
pale
ale
if
it
was
good
enough
for
buffalo
bill
to
take
across
the
wild
west
as
the
bottle
claims
then
its
good
enough
for
me
overall
such
a
completely
boring
of
a
pale
ale
how
can
a
beer
this
old
and
apparently
steeped
in
history
be
so
uninspired
have
they
ever
tasted
fullers
london
pride
served
on
tap
at
a
hotel
bar
this
was
a
pleasant
diversion
from
lagers
mid
amberlight
copper
and
mostly
clear
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
a
pungent
caramel
that
was
just
a
bit
stale
the
taste
was
of
cream
and
caramel
with
a
general
sweetness
little
lacing
without
strong
competition
one
might
drink
this
through
an
evening
and
not
decry
the
lagers
lost
a
sweet
flowery
sense
throughout
acceptable
if
not
impressive
i
had
pretty
much
sworn
off
bass
in
the
u
s
but
was
faced
with
little
choice
at
a
restaurant
color
me
very
surprised
much
better
than
i
recall
and
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
caskcondition
this
and
it
could
be
a
regular
drink
for
me
an
original
burton
beer
but
does
it
have
what
it
once
did
my
draft
pour
into
an
absolutely
clean
roomtemp
pint
glass
resulted
in
a
most
tempting
and
alluring
crystal
clear
copperamber
sheen
with
a
bit
of
foam
the
aroma
for
this
pale
ale
is
not
a
strong
point
its
taste
was
pleasant
with
fine
distinctive
english
ale
attributes
slight
esters
and
diacetyl
light
hops
fruity
not
a
thin
taste
yet
remains
rather
delicate
something
ive
grown
accustomed
to
or
are
memories
of
yesteryears
more
bold
flavors
deceptive
still
a
beer
i
often
enjoy
and
one
of
my
very
first
gateway
beers
served
a
beautiful
clear
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
light
nose
consisting
mainly
of
malt
smooth
and
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
to
it
nice
malty
sweetness
flavors
consist
of
biscuit
caramel
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
had
been
awhile
since
i
ordered
a
bass
and
im
glad
that
i
did
definitely
seems
more
enjoyable
on
tap
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
not
the
best
tasting
but
good
for
friends
this
draught
came
with
a
good
head
that
lingered
fairly
long
it
was
a
good
copper
color
and
very
clear
the
aroma
was
neutral
the
flavor
was
also
i
did
not
notice
either
a
malt
nor
a
hop
predominance
the
mouthfeel
was
fair
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
only
drank
one
and
switched
to
a
stout
nice
clear
amber
color
it
looks
really
pretty
the
head
is
also
nice
white
and
thick
it
smells
quite
sweet
nothing
outstanding
at
all
though
the
taste
is
also
sweetish
with
a
little
carameltaste
i
can
also
sense
a
roasted
sort
of
tone
finished
off
in
a
bitter
way
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
should
be
served
at
1012c
if
this
was
packaged
as
macroswill
at
3
99
a
sixer
that
would
be
one
thing
instead
its
presented
as
a
prestige
beer
7
or
8
bucks
a
sixer
and
almost
always
an
extra
dollar
a
pint
at
the
pub
unacceptable
however
i
should
reserve
complete
condemnation
until
i
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
the
real
deal
from
a
cask
in
the
uk
its
perfectly
suitable
for
pallid
palates
but
get
me
to
a
hopdevil
or
summit
ipa
instead
if
choices
can
be
made
personally
ill
stick
with
offerings
from
great
lakes
sierra

bridgeport
or
the

this
beer
is
intriguing
for
a

seconds
and
looks
pretty
but
is
absolutely
horrible
just
a
few
sips
gave
me
a
nasty
temporal
headache
and
i
poured
12
of
it
down

i
never
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
bass
pale
ale
is
one
of
those
beers
that
while
your
are
first
entering
the
realm
of
beer
tasting
it
is
different
and
somewhat
extraordinary
but
after
coming
back
to
it
i
am
pretty
disappointed
with
the
flavor
it
pours
a
copper
amber
tone
with
a
cream
colored
foam
head
at
first
sniff
it
produced
a
mild
nutty
aroma
along
with
some
maltiness
but
as
the
beer
settled
so
did
the
scent
at
first
taste
it
was
too
cold
to
get
any
flavors
from
the
beer
but
after
it
warms
it
produces
a
sharp
taste
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
not
anything
to
be
crazy
about
but
i
definitely
think
i
would
enjoy
this
one
top
more
m
oelergud
with
ab
crap
taking
such
a
large
share
of
worldwide
production
volume
bud
would
have
to
be
average
and
thus
get
straight
threes
in
this
context
bass
pale
ale
would
be
a
4
this
is
the
beer
ill
usually
grab
if
the
pub
doesnt
have
anything
outstanding
looks
nice
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
average
taste
and
smell
it
really
has
a
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
just
not
enough
of
either
just
slightly
above
average
but
works
in
a
pinch
based
on
what
this
beer
used
to
be
its
now
truely
disappointing
after
two
or
three
years
without
having
a
bass
ale
and
finding
myself
in
the
position
of
choosing
bass
or
bud
i
chose
bass
the
color
was
still
that
nice
pale
orangered
that
i
remembered
from
days
past
the
head
was
a
pleasant
off
white
that
lingered
around
the
glass
for
a
short
time
the
aroma
was
malty
with
hints
of
floral
notes
the
taste
was
well
balanced
with
the
malt
up
front
and
the
hops
coming
in
the
finish
my
taste
have
evolved
toward
ipas
and
esbs
in
later
life
but
it
was
nice
to
return
to
the
beer
that
got
me
hooked
on
beer
in
the
first
place
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
but
a
little
bit
plain
from
the
tap
it
comes
colored
of
a
light
bronzecopper
the
head
is
white
and
very
there
and
it
lasts
a
good
time
its
lace
clings
to
the
sides
of
glass
to
the
last
drop
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
some
floral
appeal
the
taste
is
a
combonation
of
a
sweet
maltcaramel
with
bittering
hops
and
some
faint
floral
good
beer
matches
great
as
a
black
and
tan
two
words
blacktan
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
sweet
maltiness
with
some
floral
notes
as
well
it
has
a
very
buttery
taste
and
texture
in
the
mouth
and
a
bit
of
a
nutty
flavor
its
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
and
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
cant
understand
for
the
life
of
me
why
everyone
wants
to
hate
on
the
bass
ale
if
you
want
a
good
dependable
beer
that
goes
great
with
almost
any
food
bass
is
it
sure
it
doesnt
necessarily
blow
you
away
with
any
complex
flavors
or
anything
really
complex
at
all
for
that
matter
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
the
brewers
intended
a
strong
apple
flavor
is
present
in
this
beer
and
to
me
tastes
like
a
combination
between
apple
cider
and
a
typical
lager
or
pilsner
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
bass
pours
to
a
nice
orangishamber
color
with
a
thich
offwhite
head
that
lasts
forms
a
nice
lacework
while
sipped
down
its
nose
is
one
of
sweet
malt
the
flavors
taste
of
caramel
malt
and
fruity
hops
overall
this
beer
is
well
balaced
and
very
drinkable
got
this
on
draught
at
gameworks
here
in
columbus
the
keg
seemed
a
little
flat
but
otherwise
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
kind
you
can
get
in
the
bottle
an
allaround
good
clean
beer
not
too
light
and
not
too
stout
a
definite
step
up
for
a
beginner
in
the
beer
tasting
game
not
too
exciting
but
a
good
staple
beer
i
am
apt
to
get
if
there
is
nothing
new
and
exciting
available
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
beige
frothy
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
sheer
that
leaves
nice
wispy
lace
heavy
malt
aroma
with
some
carmel
and
earthy
hops
light
to
medium
body
smooth
but
a
little
thin
on
the
tounge
toasted
grain
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
and
butter
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
hop
bite
not
bad
at
all
for
something
easy
to
get
may
they
burn
in
hades
with
their
money
as
the
fuel
that
feeds
satans
furnace
shockingly
ive
had
a
million
of
these
beers
but
have
never
reviewed
it
so
i
got
a
pint
tonight
looks
great
copper
and
a
great
head
taste
not
so
much
hard
to
describe
had
a
little
malt
a
little
hops
not
bad
not
good
right
down
the
middle
for
a
beer
this
nice
amber
beer
pours
with
a
medium
density
head
with
good
head
retention
it
will
leave
a
mild
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aromas
are
subtle
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
fairly
clean
with
not
a
lot
going
on
it
feels
very
good
on
the
palate
and
finshes
fairly
clean
for
an
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
lingering
aftertatse
this
is
much
the
way
i
remembered
it
from
college
a
decent
beer
with
an
above
average
reputation
drink
it
in
a
black
and
tan
amber
in
color
with
a
frothy
rocky
white
head
average
retention
nose
is
pretty
quiet
some
soft
malty
aromas
crisp
mouthfeel
toasted
malt
flavors
are
the
main
feature
balanced
by
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
on
the
way
to
a
very
abrupt
finish
unremarkable
but
would
probably
make
a
decent
steppingstone
brew
for
someone
trying
to
make
the
jump
to
good
beer
decent
head
orangish
body
a
little
bit
of
hops
a
little
bit
of

a
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
yet
a
solid
beer
a
good
session

i
think
it
is
also
good
as
a
standby

you

the

the
flavor
was
malt
with
a
slight

presence
that
was
not
evident
in
the
flavor
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
as
others
have
pointed
out
consistent
and
available
at
most
bars
getting
home
late
last
night
to
frozen
pizza
i
had
to
run
to
store
24
for
beer
there
it
was
bass
bass
never
fails
me
the
taste
is
still
satisifing
not
ovepowering
i
do
not
find
it
bitter
at
all
the
first
glass
always
goes
down
smooth
i
usually
buy
two
large
singles
which
go
great
with
any
meal
the

it
harkens
me
back
to
my
nautical
expierences
i
could
live
on
bass
consistent
indeed
with
nearly
100
reviews
all
the
qualities
of
this
excellent
pale
ale
have
been
pointed
out
already
great
on
tap
great
bottled
forget
that
bass
is
now
owned
by
big
bad
interbrew
and
just
enjoy
it
consistent
this
is
a
widely
produced
pale
ale
that
still
manages
to
satisfy
me
it
isnt
pushing
the
envelope
but
it
is
still
solid
the
color
is
great
reddish
amber
as
well
as
the
smell
sweet
fruity
the
smell
and
taste
but
are
evidence
of
a
good
blend
of
flavors
hops
malt
neither
is
obvious
this
is
surely
drinkable
and
for
a
beer
that
is
found
in
most
bars
it
is
pretty
strong
a
good
fall
back
beer
brewed
by
bass
brewers
limited
burtonontrent
england
bright
even
amber
tones
topped
with
average
head
that
persisted
but
didnt
overwhelm
surprisingly
fragrant
rather
light
and
a
bit
fruity
for
as
even
and
tame
as
it
tastes
taste
is
smooth
and
relatively
uniform
throughout
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
its
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
doesnt
extend
itself
but
what
it
does
it
does
well
a
very
nice
ambergoldtan
hue
a
frothy
but
unimposing
nonlingering
head
drains
away
faster
than
it
should
nice
aroma
light
coffeecocoanut
scent
a
nice
taste
as
far
as
pale
ales
go
not
too
distinctive
one
way
or
the
other
goes
down
well
enough
to
have
a
second
but
make
a
trip
to
the
titanic
to
recover
some
old
bass
no
this
beer
appears
brownish
red
with
gold
highlights
like
an
overworked
hairdo
there
is
a
diverse
head
that
quickly
recedes
leaving
a
few
strands
of
lace
it
smells
like
a
jar
of
pennies
at
this
point
i
consider
moving
on
to
the
next
beer
but
i
stick
with
it
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
suprise
after
the
nose
good
full
dry
beginning
finishes
somewhat
quick
4
seconds
yet
balanced
a
dusty
burned
sugar
flavor
weaves
throughout
offset
by
mild
bittering
hops
simple
good
this
is
one
of
those
dinner
beers
i
really
wasnt
impressed
with
it
enough
to
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
with
that
said
i
did
like
the
beer
it
pours
darkish
amber
with
a
small
head
that
disappeared
no
lace
the
taste
is
hops
up
front
malt
in
the
middle
and
dryness
at
the
end
the
dryness
is
what
makes
this
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
red
meat
the
nose
was
very
mild
with
sweetness
but
mostly
hops
it
does
pack
enough
of
a
taste
punch
for
any
ba
to
like
id
drink
it
again
at
dinner
update
2015
almost
13
years
later
im
reviewing
bass
ale
again
this
time
it
is
from
a
recently
produced
bottle
made
in
the
usawilliam
bass
cos
baldwinsville
ny
to
be
exact
wtf
anywayit
still
has
much
of
the
iconic
mineral
bite
of
the
english
import
you
have
to
appreciate
modern
brewing
methods
good
job
okay
i
have
had
this
beer
on
several
occasions
in
the
past
but
finally
had
it
again
for
a
night
out
to
dinner
it
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
faded
quickly
with
no
lace
it
had
a
slight
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
hops
and
slightly
sweet
but
tough
to
figure
out
what
the
finish
was
dry
and
slightly
bitter
an
alright
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
while
i
like
bass
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
it
is
like
a
dessert
beer
to
me
nice
ale
but
not
my
first
pick
when
at
a
bar
i
like
to
call
this
the
yuppies
ale
nice
brown
color
but
has
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
pours
a
caramel
color
with
a
1
12
finger
with
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
that
of
a
slight
burnt
malty
sweetness
right
off
the
bat
the
creamy
mouthfeel
hits
you
first
the
taste
contains
a
freshly
cut
hay
flavor
with
shellacksp
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
grow
on
me
its
not
terrible
and
in
fact
if
the
flavor
went
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
it
could
be
much
better
cheers
this
bass
was
much
better
than
i
remember
of
my
other
outings
with
it
i
guess
when
draught
it
is
significantly
better
amber
colour
with
a
fairly
creamy
head
the
scent
was
based
in
earthy
tones
and
a
pretty
hoppy
i
suppose
the
nobles
are
at
it
again
the
brew
has
a
meduim
body
with
a
pretty
smooth
feel
about
it
it
drank
pretty
good
nothing
striking
but
good
i
suggest
that
nobody
should
turn
their
nose
at
a
tapped
bass
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
eurostyle
long
neck
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
beer
itself
is
not
terrible
but
there
is
just
a
horrible
aftertaste
it
is
however
much
better
out
of
the
220z
bottle
i
broke
out
some
tasting
notes
from
my
trips
to
london
and
will
post
the
reviews
of
those
beers
spaced
over
the
next
few
days
or
so
bass
from
the
cask
is
where
its
at
the
bottled
version
we
get
here
pales
in
comparison
nice
inviting
copper
color
with
nice
head
my
british
pint
glass
was
sheeted
with
lace
cask
conditioned
smoothess
and
drinkability
are
its
trademarks
man
i
miss
london
bass
itself
while
quite
palatable
on
its
own
is
best
consumed
in
unison
w
guinness
pours
a
brownishorange
color
slight
cirtus
hop
nose
on
the
palate
light
citrus
hop
and
caramel
tones
also
very
refreshing
i
really
like
bass
a
good
fall
back
beer
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
cant
figure
out
why
i
havent
rated
it
anyway
in
the
past
in
the
bottles
its
been
pretty
bland
not
really
malty
enough
to
be
a
good
pale
ale
like
samuel
smiths
and
not
enough
good
hop
character
to
be
a
good
ipa
this
time
i
had
it
on
tap
and
i
could
have
sworn
i
caught
some
mild
but
definite
estery
flavors
going
on
it
was
much
better
this
time
around
when
in
an
establishment
with
only
the
obvious
choices
of
mass
produced
beer
this
is
always
my
old
stand
by
not
one
of
the
best
brews
in
the
world
but
certainly
a
very
good
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
can
be
had
with
any
type
food
my
personal
fav
for
kegs
and
eggs
so
if
you
are
in
a
restaurant
and
dont
have
many
choices
and
they
have
bass
then
by
all
means
go
for
it
cheers
easy
drinking
though
first
time
ive
had
this
on
its
own
for
years
usually
its
part
of
a
bt
still
a
good
taste
hoppy
bitter
but
not
to
the
level
that
ive
come
to
require
in
a
pale
ale
hops
more
hops
picked
up
a
6
pack
on
sale
for
4
99
i
dont
know
that
i
would
be
whatever
the
full
price
is
but
it
was
just
about
right
at
the
price
its
a
pretty
good
easy
drinker
although
not
easy
enough
for
my
neighbor
who
didnt
seem
to
take
to
it
i
found
everything
to
be
sort
of
muted
in
this
brew
compared
to
the
finer
versions
the
hops
were
mellow
the
citrus
notes
were
pretty
easygoing
the
head
topping
the
dark
gold
brew
had
a
lot
of
staying
power
providing
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
finish
was
pretty
dry
but
with
a
bit
of
a
lemony
zing
medium
to
full
body
with
balance
of
medium
bitterness
an
unusual
palate
almost
like
a
blend
of
banana
citrus
toasty
grain
hoppy
flavors
nice
hoppy
finish
nice
appearance
full
thick
head
pleasant
floral
aroma
creamy
taste
with
a
malt
sweetness
somewhat
chewey
but
flat
tasting
goes
good
with
a
guiness
to
make
a
black
and
tan
amber
body
big
fluffy
white
head
tiny
bubbles
rising
good
malty
nose
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
in
taste
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
has
nice
full
rounded
sensation
the
classic
english
pale
ale
retains
far
more
of
its
character
than
its
american
and
german
lager
cousins
even
at
macro
production
levels
often
available
at
pubs
and
restaurants
with
limited
beer
lists
its
a
good
beer
to
have
around
for
both
advocates
and
the
budmillercoors
crowd
top
of
the
line
at
many
chain
restaurants
and
definitely
better
than
most
american
macro
offerings
do
not
allow
them
to
serve
it
in
a
frosted
mug
as
you
will
be
drinking
what
amounts
to
amber
hop
water
bass
ale
will
be
a
much
better
beer
if
the
malt
end
is
allowed
to
show
at
proper
serving
temp
also
benefits
from
a
cap
of
guinness
this
is
a
good
fallback
beer
that
can
be
found
in
many
decent
bars
and
restaurants
we
used
to
order
a
keg
of
bass
at
almost
every
party
we
had
at
asu
and
were
never
disappointed
its
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
head
that
fades
quickly
toffecaramel
flavors
are
noticeable
but
its
not
overly
sweet
first
off
i
have
to
admit
i
had
long
ago
dismissed
this
beer
as
yet
another
macro
with
a
british
accent
when
a
friend
handed
me
a
bottle
this
weekend
though
i
was
reminded
that
this
really
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
typical
paleale
amber
color
with
a
billowy
white
head
slightly
herbal
hop
aroma
a
bit
tangy
with
a
barelyperceptible
malty
sweetness
starts
with
a
tangy
almost
metallic
taste
that
gives
way
to
a
barely
noticeable
sweetness
finish
is
pleasantly
bitter
overall
more
balanced
than
i
recall
and
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
a
staple
and
or
conversion
beer
for
lots
of
people
amber
color
wih
a
rich
head
sweet
nose
hoppy
bitter
taste
with
a
slight
sourness
i
would
like
a
little
more
on
the
malt
side
to
increase
the
body
great
lace
on
the
glass
thick
persistent
billowy
off
white
head
amber
and
very
clear
in
color
theres
no
haze
whatsoever
its
very
appealing
in
appearance
fruity
yeast
esters
in
aroma
but
the
perfumey
and
grassy
perhaps
challenger
hop
nose
provide
for
a
complex
yet
clean
aroma
profile
mild
diacetyl
butterscotch
becomes
noticeable
as
the
hop
oils
dissipate
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
results
in
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
body
is
fairly
light
but
there
are
enough
malt
and
hop
flavors
to
make
this
quite
a
tasty
british
pale
this
brew
is
well
balanced
the
crystal
malt
sweetness
and
residual
sugars
are
well
balanced
by
the
moderate
hop
bitterness
bass
finishes
with
slight
biscuit
malt
flavors
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
pale
ale
is
very
clean
and
enjoyable
all
around
its
more
estery
and
fruity
and
much
less
assertive
hopwise
than
the
typical
american
pale
and
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
highly
quaffable
this
is
the
first
time
that
ive
had
bass
in
several
years
i
seem
to
remember
it
as
being
more
complex
and
enjoyable
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
slightly
bitter
has
virtually
no
sweetness
and
no
real
aftertaste
pours
to
form
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
inoffensive
and
common
ok
i
am
altering
my
entire
review
based
on
this
one
bottle
i
used
to
hate
this
stuff
more
than
anything
and
even
after
i
had
some
more
advanced
taste
buds
i
still
couldnt
handle
the
aftertaste
of
bass
however
this
one
isnt
terrible
its
drinkable
i
am
almost
embarrassed
that
i
am
drinking
this
after
all
the
bassbashing
i
have
done
over
the
years
but
i
do
this
to
myself
every
now
and
then
i
get
a
bottle
of
bass
to
see
if
i
can
handle
it
this
is
the
first
time
i
can
i
dont
really
feel
like
commenting
much
on
the
beer
as
this
is
a
very
awkward
moment
for
me
its
appearance
is
nice
always
has
been
citrusy
hoppy
aroma
somewhat
metallic
aftertaste
still
but
tolerable
this
is
very
awkward
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
able
to
sleep
tonight
85
i
think
a
bottle
of
bass
is
an
old
reliable
beer
i
will
always
order
it
at
retaurant
or
pub
where
the
only
other
choices
are
buds
millers
coors
etc
nice
inviting
brown
color
head
quickly
disappears
but
always
tastes
great
compliments
many
meals
and
i
find
it
always
refreshing
i
try
to
keep
some
always
in
my
supply
at
home
but
last
night
drank
my
last
one
always
will
be
a
winner
to
me
dark
amber
in
color
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
subsides
to
almost
nothing
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
sort
of
candy
like
perhaps
butterscotch
medium
body
with
the
sweet
malts
dominating
the
soft
hops
anybody
that
slams
this
ale
is
stupid
there
is
a
reason
why
bass
is
perfect
in
black
and
tans
with
guiness
or
any
other
dry
stout
i
can
detect
the
uniqueness
of
the
water
used
which
imparts
a
delightful
dance
on
palate
along
with
the
hops
this
is
a
difficult
ale
to
review
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
there
must
be
some
reason
why
bass
is
a
world
renowned
english
ale
a
classic
i
am
a
big
fan
of
bass
ale
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
introduced
me
to
the
world
of
brew
outside
of
u
s
macros
it
was
my
breakout
brew
this
beer
pours
to
a
nice
light
amber
color
has
a
slight
metallic
in
a
good
way
taste
and
has
a
nice
hop
presence
on
the
finish
a
quality
fallback
beer
for
me
many
times
this
is
the
best
beer
available
in
the
bar
amber
in
color
and
a
decent
head
out
of
the
tap
is
the
best
one
of
the
great
session
beers
for
me
its
even
better
with
guinness
medium
amber
color
medium
sized
head
crisp
light
smell
only
of
hops
the
taste
is
mostly
the
same
you
feel
it
on
the
back
of
your
throat
and
sides
of
your
tongue
with
a
little
nuttiness
going
on
could
use
some
more
character
but
very
drinkable
not
good
another
one
of
these
english
ales
which
gets
a
huge
wrap
but
it
is
quite
overrated
dont
like
it
of
the
widely
distributed
world
wide
beers
this
is
one
of
the
best
deep
reddishamber
color
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
fruity
character
but
not
overly
so
which
balances
nicely
with
the
malt
and
hops
i
slight
toasty
flavor
toasted
grainsmalt
is
also
prevalent
but
has
a
small
say
the
hops
are
there
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
which
appeals
to
me
all
flavors
seem
to
be
in
perfect
balance
with
one
another
this
beer
is
complex
not
as
complex
as
many
but
has
more
then
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
taste
buds
interested
a
great
drinking
beer
tough
to
have
just
one
and
one
of
my
standbys
on
occasion
i
will
have
a
bass
if
nothing
else
is
available
or
i
am
just
not
going
to
have
a
sam
adams
lager
i
find
bass
a
very
drinkable
massproduced
beer
always
has
a
nice
color
with
faint
bitterness
and
a
moderate
malty
grain
flavor
it
is
very
average
compared
to
most
good
beers
but
i
find
it
acceptable
espcially
if
it
is
not
my
main
focus
of
the
evening
better
on
tap
but
a
solid
choice
this
beer
isnt
going
to
overwhelm
you
with
any
one
quality
but
you
buy
it
because
you
know
what
you
are
getting
while
this
is
the
standard
for
pale
ale
i
think
it
has
become
more
mainstream
bud
like
over
the
years
i
can
remember
how
wonderful
this
was
15
to
20
years
ago
maybe
my
tastes
have
changed
it
just
doesnt
seem
the
same
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
there
is
so
much
better
and
made
right
here
in
the
good
old
usa
bottom
line
this
is
good
beer
not
great
but
good
are
there
better
beers
out
there
of
course
in
terms
of
mass
produced
beer
so
is
guinness
itll
do
better
than
many
others
in
a
pinch
good
bang
for
your
buck
but
dont
expect
anything
spectacular
an
essential
component
for
a
classic
black
tan
notes
i
must
admit
that
i
never
order
this
beer
however
it
is
truly
a
classic
and
a
prime
example
of
a
traditional
english
pale
ale
nothing
outrageously
outstanding
mind
you
but
all
the
same
enjoyable
youll
see
this
beer
cloned
all
over
the
beer
shelves
and
in
brewpubs
which
says
enough
in
itself
around
4
4abv
o
boring
ive
had
plenty
of
3
abv
beers
with
twice
as
much
flavour
as
this
o
buy
it
to
support
the
small
brewery
and
make
your
own
mind
up
the
bottle
is
cool
i
wont
buy
it
again
not
bad
a
welljudged
ale
that
hits
the
right
notes
looks
good
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
showcase
biscuity
malt
and
delicate
grassy
hops
decent
body
a
good
example
of
a
traditional
ale
goes
down
nicely
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
pours
a
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
settles
back
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
at
first
a
mild
skunky
as
is
common
for
some
reason
with
brews
in
green
bottles
and
is
of
malts
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
with
some
buttery
malts
coming
through
lower
carbonation
which
fit
this
one
to
a
tee
actually
easy
to
drink
as
i
wasnt
sure
o
the
skunkiness
could
be
dealt
with
better
by
putting
it
in
darker
bottles
and
it
could
be
a
more
interesting
beer
but
its
tasty
and
worth
a
try
recommended
not
amazing
not
terrible
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
or
ontap
then
speak
my
opinion
again
rjt
3
25
d
its
decent
but
i
vastly
prefer
the
english
ale
over
this
overall
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
a
great
english
pale
ale
either
a
bit
unbalanced
but
okay
i
guess
its
a
rather
hoppy
english
pale
ale
d
a
clean
and
refreshing
english
pale
overall
this
beer
is
probably
not
objectively
bad
but
its
flavor
profile
jibes
neither
with
what
i
know
of
this
style
nor
my
palate
in
general
the
taste
is
full
of
english
yeast
toffee
malts
and
a
decent
semilingering
hop
bite
on
the
tail
end
500
ml
dicinal
bottle
orange
to
gold
colour
with
normal
head
that
dissappears
sooon
smell
is
earthy
grains
hops
palate
is
maybe
too
light
fizzy
but
smooth
taste
is
rough
in
the
beginning
earthy
caramel
citrus
notes
yes
is
similar
in
character
to
czech
lager
and
its
good
overall
decent
but
not
a
highlight
for
me
dont
usually
like
this
style
but
this
is
really
well
developed
nice
beer
got
this
guy
from
his
new
round
bottle
gotta
say
i
almost
prefer
the
more
flasklike
model
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
orange
peel
and
very
light
banana
the
taste
sticks
to
the
smells
guns
altering
pretty
much
nothing
fair
enough
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
nice
little
epa
nothing
amazing
but
something
easily
taken
down
with
moderate
pleasure
and
yes
i
could
sound
more
like
a
humanizing
robot
i
just
choose
not
to
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
d
a
clean
and
refreshing
english
pale
ale
that
would
be
nothing
short
of
sensual
art
on
a
july
afternoon
besides
the
drinkability
its
flavourful
and
has
complexity
to
make
it
worth
sipping
as
well
as
sessioning
well
worth
a
try
o
this
tastes
more
like
an
emaciated
bitter
than
a
british
substitute
for
a
pilsner
i
dont
mind
a
good
pilsner
when
fresh
but
my
experience
with
their
other
beers
had
me
hoping
i
had
found
my
goto
warm
weather
beer
sadly
it
lacked
comparable
character
and
isnt
worth
the
price
o
the
soft
malt
flavor
is
very
dry
with
the
hops
becoming
mostly
bitey
with
the
carbonic
acid
but
they
do
hold
a
bit
of
their
flavor
the
hops
were
very
nice
in
the
nose
but
the
off
aromas
were
hard
to
get
past
pours
a
murky
light
honey
orange
with
a
12
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
very
small
dots
of
lace
randomly
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
grains
and
some
honey
taste
is
of
malt
grains
bread
and
slight
hop
flavors
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
that
sticks
around
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
wish
the
carbonation
level
was
a
bit
higher
other
than
the
unusual
bottle
shape
i
found
this
beer
underwhelming
poured
a
2
white
head
which
quickly
vanished
clear
straw
yellow
in
color
not
really
even
golden
smell
is
moderately
skunked
it
tastes
like
standard
bmcs
except
for
a
lasting
bitter
finish
and
a
moderate
zing
i
dont
see
whats
the
big
deal
o
on
the
whole
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
well
made
english
pale
ale
its
not
something
that
will
wow
you
but
it
is
a
good
solid
brew
o
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
though
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
i
prefer
much
maltier
english
ales
but
that
being
it
still
has
some
unique
qualities
that
certainly
make
it
worth
a
try
d
not
bad
there
is
nothing
too
complex
going
on
here
but
it
certainly
has
all
of
the
requisite
components
of
beer
the
hops
and
yeast
are
appropriately
disposed
to
misty
and
fruity
notes
respectively
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
offered
a
glass
in
the
future
but
i
cant
really
see
any
reason
to
spend
money
on
it
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
undercarbonated
drinkability
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
of
this
brew
when
i
opened
it
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
very
nice
well
rounded
beer
a
great
brew
for
spring
and
summer
worth
a
try
very
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
it
was
rather
filling
for
a
low
abv
beer
also
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
definitely
consider
having
another
one
of
these
because
it
is
very
flavorful
d
light
session
beer
easily
can
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
nothing
special
the
english
pale
ale
is
a
style
of
beer
with
which
im
sort
of
going
through
a
bit
of
a
rough
spell
this
little
brew
will
certainly
go
far
towards
rekindling
our
once
powerful
romance
an
easydrinking
pub
ale
full
of
flavor
and
brilliantlooking
in
the
accompanying
glass
great
stuff
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
definitely
work
as
a
session
drink
its
definitely
a
passable
drinkable
beer
however
i
find
it
weighs
a
bit
heavy
and
its
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
varieties
produced
at
st
peters
brewery
medium
bodied
with
a
lighter
than
normal
amount
of
carbonation
thats
a
high
point
in
my
review
of
st
peters
golden
that
and
drinkability
i
could
put
a
few
away
for
sure
nice
fair
for
summer
patio
sipping
or
with
bar
b
q
solid
offering
from
this
brewer
all
things
considered
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
but
its
really
not
bad
i
could
even
see
this
growing
on
me
in
time
definitely
worth
a
taste
i
recently
had
a
positive
experience
with
the
st
peters
winter
ale
so
i
went
into
this
tasting
with
enthusiasm
unfortunately
my
enthusiasm
was
short
lived
on
the
pour
a
hazy
honey
gold
colour
with
no
head
and
the
thinnest
of
rings
no
visible
carbonation
almost
perfectly
flat
but
for
a
few
suspended
bubbles
on
top
slightly
grassy
bouquet
with
a
lemonylime
odour
very
earthy
taste
heavy
tasting
unpleasant
not
much
by
way
of
a
hops
could
be
an
abundance
of
malt
but
whatever
it
was
it
didnt
work
with
warming
a
distinctly
sour
finish
i
found
it
hard
to
finish
this
beer
in
fact
i
didnt
not
recommended
drelatively
good
drinkablity
not
my
favorite
beer
but
worth
trying
and
drinking
again
everyonce
and
a
while
the
first
mouthful
was
surprising
as
it
was
very
bitter
tasting
it
got
better
with
every
mouthful
by
the
end
of
it
i
was
wanting
more
overall
not
bad
now
i
can
say
ive
had
one
dont
know
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
another
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
mark
of
the
style
i
only
wish
we
could
get
it
here
all
year
round
drinkability
no
not
really
drinkability
a
nice
pleasant
golden
brew
from
st
peters
im
particularly
digging
the
softer
lighter
carbonation
there
are
some
sweet
and
slightly
tart
elements
to
this
beer
that
balance
quite
nicely
nice
refreshing
qualities
i
can
honestly
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
on
the
other
side
the
beer
is
a
little
unremarkable
it
is
a
solid
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
just
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
a
pint
at
a
time
this
slightly
bolder
ale
poured
a
golden
orange
color
with
slight
head
that
hung
on
to
the
glass
it
left
a
lacy
film
the
smell
was
a
bit
citrusy
and
fruity
not
too
strong
slight
peppery
there
was
a
tartness
at
first
taste
to
the
tongue
definite
hopness
that
immediately
disappeared
and
was
replaced
by
sharp
citrus
flavors
the
taste
lingered
for
a
while
after
and
left
a
filmy
feel
the
overall
taste
was
fairly
smooth
fairly
drinkable
not
one
in
which
i
would
particularly
pick
up
again
but
good
to
try
this
is
a
fairly
smooth
beer
but
lacks
punch
it
went
down
very
easy
and
is
quite
sessionable
extreme
beer
enthusiasts
will
scoff
at
this
one
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
worth
having
from
time
to
time
its
drinkable
and
the
robust
bitterness
gives
it
its
edge
its
just
not
particularly
special
otherwise
its
drinkable
enough
but
only
because
its
bland
ive
had
a
few
others
from
st
peters
and
really
enjoyed
them
not
quite
sure
what
happened
here
ultimately
a
very
good
golden
ale
and
probably
bolder
than
most
on
the
malts
and
hops
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
low
abv
makes
this
a
decent
session
brew
but
im
thinking
the
import
cost
would
prohibit
that
not
a
bad
brew
im
not
mad
at
it

i
wouldnt
turn
down

not

from

from

just
not

not

its

perhaps
sessionable
i
like
this
beer
but
not
my
favorite
and
not
worth
the
import
price
for
a
beer
in
wv
d
slightly
above
average
drinkability
with
the

has
an
earthiness
to
it
and
slightly
silky
lactose
accompanying
the
other
flavors
but
feels
rather
thin
in
general
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
lacking
in
many
aspects
not
enough
malt
or
hop
or
anything
to
overshadow
the
the
thin
yet
hard
water
seriously
its
about
the
same
quality
as
an
imported
macro
lager
and
has
many
similar
qualities
sigh
sorry
i
cant
seem
to
find
anything
exciting
in
this
beer
the
beer
earned
a
passing
grade
for
taste
but
fell
horribly
short
of
the
mark
in
all
other
categories
nearly
every
aspect
of
this
beer
was
bland
lifeless
and
uninteresting
im
not
sure
i
could
envision
any
situation
where
id
find
this
an
acceptable
nevermind
satisfying
pint
ive
found
st
peters
beers
to
be
hit
or
miss
their
golden
ale
was
nowhere
near
target
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
two
or
three
bottle
poured
a
light
copper
color
ale
with
a
dirty
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
dry
english
hops
with
a
dry
malt
base
taste
is
slightly
bitter
from
the
hops
with
a
nondescript
malt
base
no
flaw
could
be
detected
and
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
beer
was
really
refreshing
but
also
lacking
some
characteristics
such
as
some
floral
notes
pours
a
cloudy
rusty
brown
thin
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
collar
some
decent
lacing
colour
is
a
bit
strange
though
very
muddy
smell
is
decent
sweet
and
malty
some
caramel
bread
grassy
soft
floral
bit
of
orange
zest
refreshing
taste
is
not
as
good
kind
of
dull
light
maltiness
very
bready
some
floral
herbal
bitterness
bit
grassy
otherwise
not
much
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavour
it
throwing
me
off
md
slightly
more
fizzy
than
it
appears
to
be
but
overall
the
experience
on
the
palate
is
refreshing
rather
than
sharp
compared
with
the
organic
best
bitter
that
i
tried
yesterday
this
golden
ale
seems
to
lack
a
central
theme
to
adhere
to
hence
slightly
losing
the
plot
after
half
a
bottle
luckily
the
lively
bitterness
and
hoppiness
are
always
the
timely
saviour
that
a
drinker
like
me
cant
do
without
pours
a
nice
golden
colour
with
a
decent
white
head
that
laces
fairly
well
a
lot
of
grain
but
also
a
slight
skunky
note
in
the
aroma
which
i
find
really
disappointing
but
somehow
predictable
luckily
its
not
too
dominant
in
the
flavour
so
im
glad
i
drank
this
on
day
of
purchase
and
not
later
very
grainy
flavour
with
grass
earth
and
lemon
im
guessing
the
last
three
are
from
the
hopping
overall
too
much
grain
for
me
to
enjoy
and
i
even
picked
up
on
a
slightly
unpleasant
corny
undertone
that
reminded
me
of
macro
swill
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
however
suffers
greatly
from
the
inbalance
of
flavours
and
the
nagging
hint
of
skunk
ffs
sort
it
out
im
not
the
first
one
to
have
noticed
this
with
this
brewery
st
peters
lighter
beers
seem
to
be
skunk
magnets
due
to
the
bottle
colour
which
is
a
terrible
shame
because
their
heavier
darker
brews
are
fantastic
i
would
be
interested
to
try
this
fresh
or
on
tap
tasted
on
61708
ill
be
sure
to
get
some
more
bottles
another
great
beer
from
st
peters
d
very
drinkable
solid
epa
nice
balanced
flavours
d
this
was
pretty
good
i
liked
it
better
than
their
english
ale
however
the
5
price
tag
is
about
high
the
taste
is
weak
toasted
bread
with
a
lot
of
bitter
lemon
rind
that
makes
it
sharp
and
bitter
but
leaves
little
real
flavour
it
almost
gave
me
a
sore
throat
first
of
all
great
bottle
i
gave
the
appearance
an
extra
half
point
for
it
the
ale
poured
a
nice
tinted

tiny
bubbles
throughout
and
a
half
inch

flavor
made
me
think
honey
hops
if
that
makes
any
sense

very
soft
very

solid

the
price
keeps
it
from
being
a

beer
around
here
if
i
were
to
get
a
raise
or
win
the

this
would
be

this
is
a
very

earthy
with

very
earthen

a

it

or

would

d
this

very

i
will
be
drinking
it
again
d
a

beer
but
not
my
first
choice
for

d
a
nice
light

would
be
perfect
for
a
summer

a
lawnmower

first
beer
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
very
enjoyable
this
beer
wows
the
drinker
with
an
oldschool
bottle
that
is
very
attractive
itpours
a
hearty
orangered
with
no
head
at
all
it
is
subtle
to
smellyou
kind
of
have
to
get
right
in
there
to
smell
anything
at
all
once
you
get
the
nose
though
its
very
damn
good
its
a
subtle
buttery
burnt
caramel
nose
but
with
a
hint
of
coconut
liqueur
for
such
a
mild
scent
its
surprisingly
bold
though
expectedly
rich
and
buttery
pretty
good
its
very
heavy
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
and
with
a
complete
lack
of
carbonation
letting
only
the
hops
dictate
any
pep
its
a
pretty
tasty
beervery
cozy
but
a
bit
too
dense
and
sweet
for
extended
drinking
pours
with
very
good
clarity
and
a
pretty
jewel
like
golden
amber
hue
no
head
aromas
are
predominantly
grainy
with
some
honeysweet
malt
smells
and
a
touch
of
cookedvegetal
adjunctish
smell
on
the
palate
things
are
much
more
pleasant
with
some
sweetish
caramelized
malts
that
are
rounded
into
shape
by
a
mild
hop
note
at
the
mild
palate
at
the
finish
theres
a
nice
mellow
biscuity
note
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
emphasizes
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
really
sessionable
at
a
lower
abv
good
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
light
bodied
and
goes
down
smooth
a
solid
brew
that
would
suffice
for
any
beer
lover
this
is
an
honest
beer
that
doesnt
have
any
extra
flavors
present
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
core
flavors
of
malts
and
hops
and
a
touch
of
yeasty
goodness
cheers
so
far
all
the
light
colored
st
peters
english
and
ipa
plus
this
one
taste
very
similar
like
variations
on
a
theme
of
brew
while
not
bad
in
their
own
respect
none
of
them
including
this
one
stand
alone
in
their
category
though
all
are
quite
drinkable
d
this
offering
is
very
much
in
the
st
peters
tradition
as
it
has
that
organic
flair
to
it
but
is
still
distinct
from
the
other
products
in
the
line
overall
a
drinkable
brew
that
has
enough
to
keep
the
palate
enticed
without
going
overboard
not
bad
at
all
surprisingly
bouncy
little
brew
i
enjoyed
the
golden
ale
st
peters
brews
some
good
ales
and
this
here
is
another
flavorful
english
pale
nothing
too
outstanding
but
definitely
a
real
ale
a
fine
session
ale
from
england
rather
complex
for
the
stlye
drinkabilitya
nice
drinkable
british
ale
out
of
the
5
that
ive
tried
this
is
the
least
to
my
liking
good
for
what
it
is
simple
pale
ale
but
i
thought
the
presentation
of
thier
ipa
was
a
better
rounded
quaffer
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
ipa
lovers
will
find
it
lacking
in
aroma
and
complexity
of
flavor
despite
the
bitter
attack
even
with
a
hard
pour
i
didnt
get
much
of
a
head
just
a
thin
veil
of
foam
around
the
edges
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
tinge
of
orange
aroma
has
hints
of
coffee
butterscotch
a
tiny
amount
of
skunkiness
that
dissipates
after
a
few
moments
flavor
is
buttery
malt
with
a
perceivable
hops
presence
that
is
more
leafy
in
character
than
citrusy
mouthfeel
is
pretty
nice
a
bit
on
the
creamy
side
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
average
pale
ale
still
nice
to
drink
dont
expect
any
big
flavors
out
of
this
one
though
good
drinkability
the
beer
pours
a
warm
golden
color
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
clean
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
first
whiff
from
the
bottle
is
all
hops
mostly
ekg
but
with
just
a
little
citrus
the
flavor
maintains
the
hops
presence
and
adds
light
malt
and
biscuity
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
notch
heavier
than
a
macro
lager
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
probably
be
far
more
impressive
on
cask
the
only
thing
that
gets
in
the
way
of
this
becoming
a
house
beer
for
me
other
than
that
im
a
homebrewer
is
the
nearly
3
a
bottle
price
this
is
a
nicely
executed
english
ale
its
just
not
a
3
a
bottle
ale
st
peters
golden
ale
definitely
has
the
appearance
and
presentation
of
a
good
pale
ale
it
pours
a
very
nice
orange
gold
color
and
displays
decent
lacing
though
minimal
head
retention
its
got
a
great
nose
too
notes
of
citrus
and
coffee
are
predominant
with
some
hops
showing
through
the
flavor
however
is
underwhelming
its
mostly
coffee
and
musty
yeast
with
a
bit
of
weak
citrus
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
as
well
there
was
also
a
lot
of
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottom
as
well
which
may
have
contributed
to
the
musty
flavor
all
in
all
its
not
a
bad
ale
just
disappointing
everything
leading
up
to
the
flavor
was
quite
good
only
to
be
finished
with
mediocrity
however
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
so
its
worth
having
at
least
once
very
soft
and
smooth
in
the
mouth

quite
casklike
character
and
very
quaffable
a
nice
drinkable
and
very
british
ale
overall
i
was
not
thrilled
with
this
sure
it
was
better
than
typical
large
brewery
beer
but
the
bottle
looked
like
it
would
be
better
than
it
was
definite
pale
ale
components
but
the
taste
was
off
for
me
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
probably
wont
be
buying
more
especially
at
the
price
overall
an
odd
offering
thats
worth
a
try
but
not
much
more
drank
fairly
easy
not
a
bad
bottled
english
pa
at
all
just
lacked
some
astethics
weve
had
better
ales
but
please
dont
you
think
this
is
a
generic
run
of
the
mill
ale
a
respectable
ale
but
at
3
a
bottle
i
dont
know
if
its
worth
picking
up
on
a
regular
basis
why
st
peters
doesnt
sell
this
cheaper
im
not
sure
the
overall
smoothness
of
this
beer
is
what
really
grabbed
me
nice
looking
pale
gold
body
with
a
creamy
little
head
light
wheat
and
citrus
combo
in
the
scent
and
on
the
tongue
just
very
tasty
no
a
huge
mouthfeel
but
consistent
absolutely
an
easy
drinking
ale
it
goes
down
effortlessly
the
first
taste
is
crisp
and
cool
there
is
following
that
imho
a
not
so
pleasant
hop
bitterness
that
carries
through
to
the
finish
spoiling
an
otherwise
good
mouthfeel
and
sturdiness
the
malt
does
not
balance
itsw
still
complex
enough
to
arouse
interest
and
by
all
means
try
this
stuff
just
make
sure
its
accompanied
by
a
nice
big
calzone
stuffed
with
eggplant
and
sausage
then
i
bet
its
tremendous
notes
overall
it
was
below
average
in
my
book
and
nothing
to
keep
on
hand
as
a
staple
beer
i
will
definately
try
their
other
offerings
though
as
this
is
a
pretty
complex
beer
for
the
style
it
just
didnt
come
together
well
ok
drinkability
here
but
i
can
think
of
many
ales
of
this
style
that
i
like
better
an
interesting
beer
that
you
should
try
but
i
can
only
recommend
as
a
novelty
brew
mouth
sour
upon
entering
the
mouth
with
a
delicious
lasting
extremely
bitter
swallow
that
heats
up
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
throat
on
the
way
down
this
beer
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
very
drinkable
it
is
extremely
refreshing
but
manages
to
pack
high
quality
and
quantity
flavor
hints
of
pitted
fruits
peachesapricots
which
linger
from
the
scent
and
a
tinge
of
gooseberry
or
even
if
it
doesnt
i
like
sublteness
in
ales
as
much
as
hop
bombs
but
this
is
so
sublte
as
to
be
nonexistant
kind
of
a
bummer
as
it
was
a
bit
expensive
this
beer
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
small
head
from
a
16
9
ounce
green
bottle
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
grain
taste
has
good
solid
malt
backbone
with
hops
noticeable
toward
the
finish
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
im
really
impressed
with
this
brewery
i
havent
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
yet
recommended
nice
appearance
in
the
glass
it
had
a
golden
color
as
the
name
suggests
but
it
had
a
strange
cloudiness
which
i
did
not
expect
and
is
very
unusual
for
this
style
small
head
that
dissapated
quickly
the
beer
had
a
nice
aroma
filled
with
hoppiness
and
some
citrus
tha
flavor
followed
with
more
hoppiness
and
citrus
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
was
nice
beer
to
drink
and
would
recommend
it
to
british
beer
lovers
not
bad
id
try
again
pours
from
pint
bottle
into
pint
glass
to
a
full
golden
honey
color
very
flat
pour
with
a
one
half
finger
head
that
rises
of
large
bubbles
and
fades
to
near
nothing
no
laceing
except
for
tiny
spots
following
the
beer
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
full
boquet
very
powerful
grain
malts
say
ale
all
the
way
with
a
nice
mix
of
floral
hop
aroma
more
sweet
malt
and
some
sour
grain
taste
is
full
and
more
complex
than
i
expected
from
the
look
and
pour
creamy
sweet
malt
mixes
well
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
kick
at
the
end
the
middle
lacks
a
little
but
the
hop
kick
was
and
pleasant
surprise
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
bit
watery
and
under
carbonated
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
one
that
i
would
choose
on
a
regular
basis
if
your
offered
one
drink
and
you
will
enjoy
paid
4
19
for
a
bottle
damn
thats
steep
i
dont
know
about
it
really
being
golden
in
color
more
of
a
pale
ale
appearance
there
is
a
winey
smell
in
the
nose
taste
is
good
nice
malts
good
alpha
maybe
too
much
alcohol
is
noticeable
bubble
is
sharp
but
small
and
not
foamy
good
session
beer
i
havent
been
overly
thrilled
with
the
two
other
st
peters
beers
that
ive
tried
golden
ale
is
a
head
scratcher
more
than
anything
else
its
far
from
unpalatable
but
if
flavor
is
high
on
your
list
of
priorities
look
elsewhere
a
very
clear
golden
pour
with
a
fluffy
foamy
head
that
faded
slightly
but
laced
throroughly
i
smelled
something
not
unlike
raw
wild
honey
and
some
tart
citrus
grassy
citrussy
a
bit
of
bread
like
being
a
kid
and
soaking
my
bread
in
orange
juice
dont
ask
not
as
sweet
as
oj
somewhere
inbetween
tangerine
and
grapefruit
there
was
a
residue
that
lingered
unpleasantly
but
not
horribly
offensive
served
cold
it
was
quite
refreshing
until
the
residue
was
the
remaining
quality
other
comments
a
very
long
slow
flavor
evolution
on
the
first
sip
just
when
youre
about
to
call
it
too
sweet
a
nice
hop
bitterness
creeps
in
and
hangs
around
long
after
youve
finished
drinking
the
beer
comes
in
a
very
classy
flask
shaped
bottle
very
enjoyable
my
first
sip
almost
erradicated
the
smell
from
my
memory
it
was
light
floral
and
quite
tasty
i
found
myself
liking
this
brew
more
and
more
with
each
sip
the
character
of
this
brew
has
the
confindence
to
know
you
will
grow
to
respect
it
even
after
any
initial
hesitations
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
which
is
perfect
for
english
beers
nice
creamy
texture
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
beer
is
a
murky
almost
muddy
earth
colored
brew
the
head
is
wispy
and
very
thin
english
hop
aroma
with
a
yeasty
undertone
very
earthy
and
rustic
smell
with
just
a
touch
of
sulfur
the
taste
is
light
and
delicate
considering
the
appearance
and
aroma
its
a
touch
grainy
with
a
very
mild
maltiness
caramel
with
a
light
doughyness
yeast
and
hops
mingle
in
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
gentle
and
creamy
low
carbonation
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
outstanding
drinkability

this
was
delightfully
bigger
than
i
expected
but
would
still
make
for
a
wonderful
daytime
sipper
this
brew
is
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
small
white
bubbly
head
topping
it
off
the
scent
is
sweet
malt
buttery
flowery
hops
fairly
buttery
up
front
with
a
pepper
hop
bite
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
wood
smooth
full
mouth
pretty
good
for
such
a
light
beer
its
drinkable
it
chilled
ice
cold
but
even
for
the
nice
price
of
2
99
i
dont
see
me
purchasing
more
to
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
skimpy
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
honey
and
sweet
malts
very
nice
nose
here
taste
is
very
nice
malts
honey
and
a
nice
sweet
smoothness
to
it
feels
very
creamy
smooth
and
is
easy
to
drink
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
drinkable
brew
this
came
over
as
nothing
more
than
a
thirstquencher
nothing
after
the
color
to
make
you
want
it
add
it
to
your
list
of
beers
tried
and
move
on
i
was
quite
disappointed
by
this
brew
not
up
to
the
standards
set
by
the
others
ive
enjoyed
from
st
peters
overall
beautiful
looks
nice
decent
nose
great
tastes
drinks
exceptionally
well
and
is
a
great
all
round
golden
ale
about
as
close
to
a
golden
real
ale
in
a
bottle
as
you
will
ever
get
time
for
the
golden
ale
now
like
the
appearance
of
this
beer
poured
out
a
golden
color
but
it
was
more
like
a
dark
gold
color
with
carbonation
that
was
visible
and
lacing
that
was
happening
all
the
way
until
the
end
smell
was
a
little
left
to
be
desired
i
thought
it
was
malty
hoppy
and
slightly
buttery
but
it
just
seemed
to
be
all
over
around
luckily
the
taste
made
up
for
it
malts
mixed
with
honey
hit
the
palate
first
then
blend
in
with
the
hops
that
last
through
the
aftertaste
finishes
on
the
peppery
side
but
has
that
wet
spot
in
the
aftertaste
tea
like
finish
as
well
creamy
and
smooth
one
of
the
better
golden
ales
on
the
market
excellent
clear
goldenyellow
in
color
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
light
floral
aromas
light
grainy
flavors
with
some
sweet
honey
flavors
in
the
finish
light
bodied
crisp
and
clean
not
much
going
on
with
this
one
may
be
a
decent
session
beer
it
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
it
has
a
woody

the
body
is
malty
with
some
fruit
and
nut
character
as
well
as
a
tinge

it
has

quite
unique
in
appearance
with
its
antique
oval
shape

a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
small
ivory
head
that
quickly
fades
away
with
minimal
patchy
lace
aroma
is
restrained
with
caramel
maltiness
and
english
herbal
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
to
the
point
of
feeling
watery
and
carbonation
is
low

is
biscuity
slight
caramel
and
funky
bitter
english
hops
this
seems
watered
down
and
lacks
any
substantial
character
finish
is
bitter
and
metallic
for
such
an
expensive
looking
bottle
the
contents
are
a
disappointment
a
classic
case
of
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
lacey
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
breadlike
smell
there
is
a
carapils
smell
here
sneaking
through
to
accompany
the
darker
than
average
color
the
taste
is
bitter
and
breadlike
its
watery
and
lacking
complexity
the
mouthfeel
sucks
this
is
a
light
bodied
ale
with
no
carbonation
the
beer
is
flat
the
beer
is
a
horrible
drinker
this
beer
sucks
but
ive
had
worse
pours
from
tha
trademark
st
peters
oval
flask
as
clear
gold
under
a
one
finger
white
head
with
bubbles
that
leave
next
to
no
lace
the
nose
is
mild
but
flowery
with
more
malt
coming
out
as
it
warms
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
mediumbodied
the
taste
experience
opens
with
a
great
hoppy
bite
reminiscent
of
the
best
pale
ales
a
good
malty
backbone
provides
excellent
context
for
the
hops
the
finish
is
bitter
and
flowery
leaving
a
crisp
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
drinkin
brew
st
peters
is
a
must
for
bottle
collectors
their
olive
green
flaskstyle
shape
is
one
of
a
kind
this
one
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
mostly
medium
to
large
sized
bubbles
and
thin
wisps
of
lace
the
mild
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
the
malt
body
is
more
substantial
than
it
appears
providing
a
nice
biscuity
and
lightly
herbal
quality
the
hops
are
somewhat
grapefruity
with
a
mild
lemon
and
faint
metallic
after
bite
hints
of
fruity
flavors
linger
in
the
background
flavor
is
very
golden
alelike
semi
lagery
tasting
with
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
ale
like
esteriness
maybe
a
hint
of
grape
very
smooth
mild
carbonation
id
like
to
say
more
about
this
beer
but
its
just
kind
of
dull
i
really
dont
like
goldings
hops
this
beer
pours
a
light
orangeyellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dies
off
quickly
there
is
not
really
any
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
skunky
and
yeasty
the
flavor
was
not
very
smooth
and
had
a
green
taste
i
do
not
particularly
like
this
flavor
as
it
is
a
little
too
tart
now
with
a
piece
of
breaded
fried
salmon
on
a
plate
in
front
of
me
and
a
dollop
each
of
ketchup
and
mustard
the
fragrance
of
the
beer
dances
up
to
my
nose
with
a
message
of
pale
fruits
and
fresh
cheeses
wonderfully
pure
watery
sweet
fruit
like
melon
bartlett
pears
and
white
plums
it
tastes
like
it
smells
what
luck
to
have
a
plate
of
this
kind
of
food
with
this
kind
of
beer
neither
are
my
usual
but
they
go
together
seemlessly
its
not
that
the
fish
is
very
good
either
careless
powdery
breading
plus
i
burned
one
side
but
it
loves
the
beer
it
seems
like
a
brilliant
compromise
between
the
many
robust
pale
ales
you
get
in
bottle
from
britain
and
the
need
for
lighter
alcohol
more
refreshing
beer
faint
gas
pressure
makes
it
just
creamy
nearly
like
a
nitro
package
but
there
are
alive
unpasteurized
flavors
alight
on
my
tongue
too
a
permanent
delicate
bitterness
from
boiled
hops
forms
the
base
for
moss
lychens
birch
bark
driftwood
romaine
hearts
whipped
cream
and
lemon
leaf
lingering
aftertaste
is
just
a
bit
bitter
but
is
a
great
way
to
end
the
beer
a
goldenorange
color
with
normal
cream
colored
foam
and
a
slightly
hoppy
aroma
mixed
in
with
a
light
skunkyness
the
flavor
is
fruity
malt
and
green
hops
finishing
with
a
light
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hop
dryness
the
body
is
medium
and
has
a
slightly
cookiegrainy
flavor
making
for
an
average
summery
ale
this
is
another
of
the
st
peters
beers
out
of
my
sampler
pack
and
i
must
say
i
have
been
impressed
by
all
of
them
the
golden
ale
poured
a
light
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
a
good
lace
throughout
the
whole
glass
the
smell
was
very
sweet
and
inviting
the
taste
was
more
roasty
and
burnt
than
i
expected
but
very
good
indeed
and
had
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
i
noticed
however
that
the
sweet
tastes
came
out
more
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
out
of
the
3
beers
ive
tried
in
my
pack
which
are
the
cream
stout
old
style
porter
and
the
golden
ale
ive
noticed
that
they
all
have
a
slightly
roasted
or
burnt
flavor
to
them
which
i
think
is
very
tasty
another
great
brew
from
england
at
first
this
beer
tasted
like
charcoal
and
nothing
else
it
was
very
very
strange
as
i
went
through
it
i
got
some
nice
sweet
malts
and
hops
that
were
balanced
very
well
but
i
could
not
shake
that
terrible
charcoal
taste
i
dont
know
if
something
was
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
was
just
not
good
at
all
body
was
smooth
with
very
light
carbonation
which
would
have
made
it
very
drinkable
if
the
taste
was
not
so
horrible
notes
a
very
tasty
little
golden
ale
such
a
complex
brew
for
a
smaller
built
ale
it
also
feigns
as
a
cask
ale
with
the
lighter
carbonation
this
real
real
ale
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
adecent
creamy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
lasting
thick
film
the
smell
is
of
earthy
hops
and
some
slight
toasted
malt
smooth
toasty
malts
are
evident
with
some
very
subtle
earthy
hop
tones
in
the
background
that
dont
really
do
much
to
add
bitterness
to
the
brew
the
brew
is
smooth
and
not
at
all
crisp
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
and
this
detracts
from
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
not
a
good
golden
ale
it
lacks
the
hoppy
bitterness
and
crispness
that
is
typical
for
the
style
if
you
know
that
going
in
though
it
is
a
good
tasting
brew
this
beer
tastes
solid
a
traditional
english
ale
it
is
worth
tasting
if
you
can
find
this
and
you
get
a
flaskshaped
bottle
ta
boot
cheers
a
nice
golden
colored
ale
not
heavy
low
carbonation
the
after
taste
is
only
slightly
hoppy
and
not
bitter
the
abv
is
4
7
this
is
more
of
a
best
bitter
imo
deep
gold
of
course
with
decent
head
retention
malty
grainy
nose
and
a
hint
of
floral
hop
definite
ale
like
fruityester
character
and
a
partially
dry
finish
with
a
lasting
bitterness
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
with
the
exception
of
the
gingerlemon
spiced
ale
st
petes
puts
out
some
good
brews
definitely
worth
a
try
first
off
love
the
bottle
great
idea
to
use
a
flask
style
bottle
i
bought
this
yeasterday
and
had
2
right
away
as
i
poured
the
first
the
color
was
just
great
and
the
aroma
made
my
mouth
water
i
noticed
that
the
beer
had
a
thin
head
that
vanished
quickly
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
you
can
have
several
of
and
not
feel
the
effects
of
gravity
if
you
see
this
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
it
o
nothing
really
stands
out
but
its
a
very
balanced
english
pale
ale
a
distinguished
yet
simple
english
pale
ale
not
as
good
as
a
proper
cask
offering
im
pleased
to
pick
this
up
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
certainly
not
overly
impressed
by
this
offering
and
was
hoping
for
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
traditional
english
ale
with
some
stronger
musty
malts
and
earthy
hops
this
failed
to
deliver
on
both
fronts
and
was
rather
disappointing
o
a
very
nice
real
ale
that
is
wonderfully
balanced
and
highly
sessionable
i
would
get
tired
of
drinking
this
all
night
d
a
largely
forgettable
english
pale
ale
the
combination
of
skunk
and
butter
is
not
a
winner
and
the
puzzlingly
harsh
bitterness
seems
outofplace
for
a
session
ale
i
got
about
half
the
bottle
down
before
i
gave
up
and
moved
on
to
something
better
d
a
good
english
pale
ale
on
the
bitter
side
thanks
to
an
excellent
distinctive
finish
but
still
fairly
balanced
and
exceptionally
sessionable
at
first
blush
id
say
it
tastes
like
earwax
hops
are
very
grassyfloral
pale
malts
chalky
has
an
oddly
skunky
heineken
aspect
to
it
dry
aftertaste
somewhat
astringent
my
will
to
live
fades
with
every
sip
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mild
carbonation
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
i
do
like
the
english
ales
it
should
be
noted
that
my
bottle
read
organic
english
ale
but
no
such
beer
exists
on
ba
this
could
have
had
a
major
effect
on
the
tasting
however
its
easy
to
remember
why
i
became
a
fan
of
the
brewery
after
returning
to
this
beer
more
than
a
year
after
i
first
discovered
it
its
an
easygoing
crisp
and
for
the
most
part
freshtasting
ale
i
could
drink
anytime
pours
a
moderate
brownishcopper
color
with
a
really
thin
initial
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
doesnt
leave
anything
of
note
behind
the
nose
is
an
immediate
travesty
thats
what
you
get
when
you
put
a
pale
ale
in
a
green
bottle
this
is
simply
gross
and
ridiculouslyskunked
thats
all
that
is
there
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
bad
as
the
nose
but
doesnt
offer
anything
other
than
lightstruck
hops
it
just
has
less
of
a
skunky
character
the
feel
is
gross
and
astringent
bad
bad
bad
change
the
bottle
color
please
drinkability
it
is
a
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
but
the
organic
aged
ended
with
woodstock
or
maybe
should
have
stayed
at
woodstock
drinkability
very
enjoyable
id
be
glad
to
have
these
all
night
but
wouldnt
go
on
a
goose
hunt
for
one
drink
a
soso
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
would
not
seek
out
i
can
see
how
this
would
appeal
to
some
but
there
far
better
beers
out
there
it
has
a
pleasant
smell
and
taste
but
lacks
in
the
mouth
feel
department
yes
pours
an
orangishyellow
colour
that
starts
off
with
a
finger
or
2
of
head
but
that
dissipates
without
any
retention
or
lacing
smell
has
some
floral
hops
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
flavour
has
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
with
some
sweetness
nothing
off
about
this
just
a
little
bit
lacking
in
flavour
compared
to
other
pale
ales
carbonation
level
was
a
little
weak
but
still
a
highly
quaffable
beer
i
think
i
appreciate
st
peters
english
ale
more
for
its
uniqueness
than
its
quaffability
although
i
do
enjoy
drinking
it
too
its
definitely
more
charismatic
than
its
generic
title
lets
on
as
i
finish
writing
this
the
fruity
hoppiness
and
chamomile
tastes
grow
more
and
more
assured
triggering
vivid
thoughts
of
spring
and
budding
flowers
its
a
good
beer
that
can
do
that
this
is
my
second
time
having
this
beer
and
the
second
time
is
what
it
took
to
appreciate
it
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
drank
it
directly
from
the
fridge
and
it
seemed
very
minerally
and
skunky
but
now
as
i
let
it
sit
as
i
reviewed
this
beers
nuances
really
started
to
shine
its
not
the
best
epa
ive
had
but
its
sure
worth
a
try
d
almost
a
session
beer
drinkable
but
the
best
part
is
the
package
it
come
in
neat
glass
would
not
buy
again
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
have
to
say
at
first
i
did
not
like
it
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
got
better
and
better
1
was
enough
for
me
but
over
all
a
good
drinking
brew
final
thoughts
this
beer
isnt
for
me
that
is
for
sure
im
not
sure
skunking
or
poor
storage
have
a
factor
here
because
i
just
cant
see
many
characteristics
i
can
appreciate
really
i
feel
that
the
only
reason
this
stuff
sells
is
because
of
the
odd
shaped
green
bottle
i
also
have
the
st
peters
cream
stout
in
my
fridge
and
i
must
say
im
not
looking
forward
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
creamy
and
smooth
with
some
diacetyl
slickness
however
the
carbonation
fades
quickly
for
a
flat
beer
midway
its
deep
golden
orange
in
colour
with
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
what
little
head
there
is
fades
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
and
splotch
in
the
middle
it
smells
of
caramel
ripe
fruit
apple
and
plum
with
a
faint
musty
character
around
the
edges
theres
an
earthy
base
to
the
flavour
profile
caramel
and
fruit
with
lemony
finish
nice
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
i
think
i
opened
this
too
cold
it
took
some
time
to
really
open
up
it
improves
significantly
as
it
warms
very
low
carbonation
and
smoothbodied
but
somewhat
light
as
well
easy
to
drink
and
light
in
the
stomach
its
definately
a
session
ale
not
my
favorite
very
deep
acidic
and
older
fruit
flavors
without
many
other
positive
aspects
in
its
wake
d
drinks
quite
easily
and
relatively
low
abv
st
peters
unique
bottle
design
is
what
first
drew
me
to
try
their
beers
several
years
ago
but
it
is
the
quality
of
their
brews
that
has
kept
me
coming
back
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
yellow
gold
with
just
the
tiniest
of
white
heads
briefly
appearing
up
top
the
aromas
are
very
earthy
with
a
pleasant
honeylike
sweetness
its
flavors
are
also
have
earthy
notes
with
a
very
intriguing
sourdough
breadiness
that
i
like
very
much
the
cost
of
st
peters
is
a
bit
steep
but
its
beers
are
well
worth
revisiting
every
now
and
then
drinkability
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
of
these
because
of
the
same
reason
for
limiting
ipas
i
dont
want
to
only
associate
beer
with
hops
it
does
get
a
little
unidirectional
when
the
malt
isnt
as
present
in
the
mix
what
a
very
interesting
beer
this
one
is
upon
opening
the
bottle
i
get
a
whiff
of
that
skunky
hoppy
smell
but
upon
pouring
i
get
honey
and
very
faint
hops
foam
dissipated
rapidly
even
after
some
of
the
yeast
residue
poured
out
into
the
glass
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
maybe
shades
of
brown
that
is
pleasant
to
look
at
and
tasted
quite
good
you
get
that
honey
at
first
followed
by
a
bit
of
spiciness
and
a
hint
of
hopssour
at
the
end
very
smooth
going
down
and
i
finished
this
beer
off
pretty
fast
over
a
fried
chicken
and
buttermilk
biscuit
dinner
really
very
tasty
ill
have
to
get
this
one
again
i
was
expecting
something
more
in
the
hoppy
pale
ale
department
and
this
is
very
different
than
any
english
ale
ive
had
the
drinkabilty
is
off
the
charts
i
could
and
would
drink
this
all
day
all
night
i
love
this
beer
and
will
seek
it
out
again
poured
a
light
amber
orangish
color
that
was
cloudy
with
very
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
hops
plums
roasted
barley
and
floral
scents
initial
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
some
bitterness
and
flowery
tea
flavors
in
the
end
it
is
a
good
beer
with
decent
drinkability
but
not
great
and
not
horrible
very
average
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
one
that
i
could
put
away
several
pints
of
drinkablity
the
abv
says
it
should
be
good
as
long
as
it
has
a
good
taste
and
i
find
it
does
i
could
easily
session
on
this
one
too
bad
its
not
carried
in
town
pours
a
mirky
golden
orange
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
without
any
lacing
earthy
aroma
of
grass
soil
and
hops
with
a
vegetablelike
quality
crisper
than
their
ipa
but
still
very
earthy
and
dirty
tasting
vegetablelike
and
bitter
but
in
a
rotten
unpleasant
kind
of
way
drinkability
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
great
to
sip
and
enjoy
i
believe
that
at
least
here
in
ontario
that
what
is
labeled
as
st
peters
english
ale
is
indeed
the
same
as
the
organic
ale
that
i
believe
they
serve
in
the
uk
not
my
favourite
st
peters
offering
but
still
a
pleasant
brew
as
was
expected
given
their
range
of
other
fantastic
brews
bought
this
bottle
at
greens
and
it
fits
nicely
into
my
english
pint
glass
pours
with
the
slightest
chill
haze
an
orange
amber
with
a
fairly
slight
head
but
one
that
is
creamy
and
settles
to
athin
cap
and
leaves
some
lacing
i
lie
the
design
of
the
bottle
but
this
one
is
is
still
in
that
light
green
glass
that
i
hate
since
it
skunks
the
beer
this
one
seems
okay
however
nicely
balanced
aromas
of
lightly
sweet
grain
earthy
hops
and
some
floral
top
notes
a
bit
of
clean
hay
is
there
as
well
smells
rustic
and
delicious
pretty
similar
in
the
taste
just
beatifully
balanced
with
some
nice
but
slight
lingering
earthy
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
slightly
metallic
undernote
tastes
fairly
fresh
with
some
light
sweetness
and
some
more
hay
very
nice
medium
bodied
with
just
enough
graininess
and
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
a
pleasure
id
love
to
try
this
on
cask
i
cant
say
that
i
favor
this
beer
its
not
that
its
bad
per
sayits
just
not
what
im
after
smooth
and
refreshing
modestly
complex
but
well
meshed
this
would
be
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
if
not
for
the
skunkiness
whats
with
the
green
bottles
the
first
time
i
tried
this
i
knew
the
bottle
was
old
so
i
didnt
rate
it
but
ive
been
told
that
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
and
the
skunk
is
still
there
some
may
not
agree
but
i
think
packaging
does
say
something
about
the
beer
inside
a
beer
can
certainly
be
delicious
without
being
stored
in
something
pretty
but
an
eyecatching
bottle
makes
a
beer
easier
to
pick
out
on
a
shelf
interesting
design
here
which
i
believe
claims
to
be
a
faithful
reproduction
of
a
late
18thcentury
bottle
a
nice
historical
tidbit
to
accompany
a
nice
historical
beer
good
session
ale
to
sit
down
and
shoot
the
bull
with
nc
beer
monger
i
would
love
to
try
this
again
with
a
fresher
bottle
i
think
the
one
i
got
was
sitting
around
for
a
while
but
with
no
freshness
dates
its
hard
to
tell
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
more
i
loved
everything
about
it
until
that
plasticrubber
aftertaste
it
wouldnt
leave
me
alone
it
teased
me
during
the
drinking
and
haunted
me
when
the
beer
was
finished
left
my
mouth
feeling
like
i
inhaled
burnt
plastic
perhaps
its
the
copper
kettle
showing
its
thing
but
im
not
sure
id
love
to
try
it
again
to
see
if
its
the
same
lightmediumbodied
and
mildly
carbonated
st
peters
is
plenty
drinkable
d
these
are
great
when
you
want
to
have
34
with
dinner
very
cloudy
yellow
brew
thick
white
head
with
good
retention
grassy
hoppy
smell
taste
comes
up
short
though
smooth
buttery
and
slightly
hoppy
but
overall
its
lacking
punch
and
disappointingly
it
has
a
slightly
metallic
flavor
decent
beer
and
would
be
an
okay
session
beer
but
not
for
the
price
overall
if
i
can
find
this
beer
again
im
definitely
buying
some
to
take
home
d
no
doubt
about
it
i
would
buy
cases
of
this
stuff
if
it
were
readily
available
thirst
quenching
refreshing
and
substantial
low
abv
makes
it
all
easier
and
sessionability
is
not
even
a
question
even
assuming
this
bottle
was
less
than
fresh
does
nothing
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
superb
organic
ale
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
not
the
first
that
i
would
choose
within
the
style
pours
into
the
glass
a
clear
pretty
golden
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
but
not
persistent
head
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
rather
like
a
lager
instead
of
an
ale
flavor
is
malty
not
complex
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
texture
is
smooth
and
has
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
not
exciting
but
palatable
definitely
an
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
brew
pours
a
lovely
copper
with
highlights
of
gold
around
the
edges
light
foam
and
light
lacing
with
some
mild
bubbling
the
aroma
is
a
light
sweet
bread
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
citrus
smells
like
a
great
session
beer
the
first
sip
brings
together
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malt
biscuits
with
splashes
of
orange
and
grapefruit
juice
great
mild
bitter
finish
with
hints
of
pine
in
an
acre
of
grapfruit
trees
while
grandma
is
baking
a
batch
of
biscuits
very
smooth
ad
balanced
ale
maybe
even
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
expected
from
an
english
ale
a
great
session
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
d
great
little
session
brew
a
little
dull
on
the
palate
but
its
got
nothing
but
fresh
grown
organics
in
it
so
it
must
be
good
for
you
the
taste
is
similar
with
lightly
toasty
bready
malt
lemon
a
little
other
citrus
in
general
some
grapefruit
and
pine
and
hints
of
caramel
and
smokiness
it
is
a
little
juicy
and
has
a
full
nice
feel
i
kinda
liked
this
then
i
do
like
sweet
beers
if
you
dont
avoid
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
orange
hues
and
a
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
with
light
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
malt
and
tea
with
light
citrus
up
front
flavors
of
caramel
toffee
then
a
tealike
hoppy
flavor
finally
finishing
smooth
and
malty
light
carbonation
easy
drinking
beer
bonus
for
using
certified
organic
hops
and
barley
overall
interesting
but
wouldnt
drink
all
night
likely
hopefully
a
damanged
beer
but
that
seems
to
be
a
recurring
theme
with
st
peters
beers
not
quite
as
bad
as
some
others
ive
tried
but
i
really
dont
feel
like
trying
one
of
these
again
d
drinkability
was
average
at
best
for
one
wouldnt
drink
in
multiples
overall
a
boring
example
per
style
and
one
that
could
get
easily
passed
over
without
missing
much
not
bad
d
if
you
are
buying
im
down
otherwise
i
am
not
seeking
this
one
out
i
will
try
their
others
though
so
many
people
i
know
crow
about
st
peters
very
nice
but
5
cdn
per
pint
an
occassional
treat
and
not
much
more
now
im
willing
to
give
this
another
shot
some
time
maybe
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
be
it
from
age
or
otherwise
after
all
i
was
very
pleased
with
their
stout
when
i
tried
it
so
i
know
they
can
make
some
tasty
brews
but
this
just
a
letdown
maybe
next
time
a
very
easy
beer
to
put
down
no
doubt
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
hop
presence
but
i
cannot
complain
since
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
lower
abv
makes
it
an
ideal
session
beer
summary
a
fantastic
english
bitter
edit
got
yet
another
skunked
bottle
from
a
different
store
in
a
totally
different
location
dammit
st
peter
switch
to
brown
bottles
already
d
drinkable
but
i
may
have
to
pour
some
out
im
not
a
big
fan
alcohol
seems
proportional
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
about
a
halfinch
white
head
which
goes
away
pretty
quickly
it
smells
like
caramel
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
skunk
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
theres
also
an
earthy
and
grainy
taste
too
finishes
nice
and
bitter
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
its
very
smooth
with
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
however
it
would
be
better
if
i
had
a
fresher
bottle
the
noticable
skunk
in
the
aroma
and
taste
not
overpowering
drops
down
the
score
a
bit
but
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
if
i
can
find
a
fresher
bottle
overall
not
too
bad
d
this
is
definitely
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
however
there
are
a
lot
of
other
choices
and
this
is
not
high
on
my
list
decent
beer
if
it
is
available
but
id
say
middle
of
the
road
for
the
category
quite
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
with
an
accentuated
hop
profile
pricy
too
i
can
think
of
better
choices
but
this
is
decent
put
it
in
four
packs
at
a
reasonable
cost
and
youve
got
something
if
they
would
make
beer
in
brown
glasses
it
would
likely
not
have
the
skunk
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
only
drawback
though
is
that
it
is
expensive
considering
it
is
good
not
great
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
if
not
for
the
moderately
hefty
price
3
49
500
ml
bottle
overall
this
beer
had
decent
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
entertained
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
from
time
to
time
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
it
not
my
favorite
epa
but
worth
a
try
pours
glub
glub
due
to
its
medicine
bottle
shape
pours
a
nice
big
head
that
retains
very
very
well
the
color
is
cloudy
and
golden
brown
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
bitter
hops
with
a
slight
caramel
maltiness
not
sharp
hops
or
malt
but
soft
and
nice
the
taste
is
very
good
i
like
the
hops
they
have
the
slightly
malty
background
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
welcoming
overall
this
is
very
nice
and
i
would
like
more
but
will
have
to
wait
until
it
comes
back
in
stock
d
i
love
this
beer
if
it
wasnt
4
a
bottle
itd
make
a
great
session
drink
tastes
like
an
e
s
b
this
is
just
a
good
english
ale
that
seems
to
me
to
be
very
sessionable
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
bronze
colour
with
a
white
head
that
dies
away
pretty
quick
plenty
of
earthy
english
style
hops
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
just
enought
malt
to
balance
thing
out
a
bit
but
plenty
of
hoppy
bitterness
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
old
stand
bys
in
this
style
besides
it
comes
in
an
awesome
bottle
d
this
is
an
okay
beer
however
i
found
it
extremely
overpriced
very
drinkable
subtle
flavors
make
this
one
either
easy
to
quaff
or
easy
to
admire
i
always
had
a
soft
spot
for
st
peters
they
have
some
good
beers
and
i
like
the
style
of
there
bottles
pours
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
disappears
slowly
but
still
clings
to
the
glass
not
much
lacing
a
hazy
amber
colour
smells
of
some
light
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
this
is
the
first
one
i
have
that
does
not
have
a
slight
skunky
note
on
the
nose
and
palate
has
a
nice
bitter
earthy
hop
finish
clean
and
tasty
a
very
nice
ale
and
one
i
am
glad
to
have
in
my
fridge
the
grassy
and
earth
english
hops
are
up
front
and
dominate
the
initial
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
more
of
a
balance
between
the
hops
and
sugary
malt
as
a
fan
of
english
beers
this
one
seems
to
be
spot
on
in
terms
of
flavor
and
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
with
little
noticeable
carbonation
and
at
only
4
5
it
could
certainly
be
a
session
beer
if
you
like
english
ales
youll
love
this
not
a
bad
english
ale
seems
like
they
followed
the
recipe
pretty
close
flavorful
and
organic
now
if
only
i
had
a
real
british
person
to
test
it
on
t
malty
and
pretty
bitter
citrusy
tones
are
a
little
too
sharp
sorta
smooth
but
not
all
that
great
overall
a
cloudy
yellowishorange
color
with
a
decent
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
nearly
long
enough
there
is
some
lacing
the
bottle
is
unique
it
looks
like
an
old
flask
of
something
potent
the
smell
is
hoppy
bitter
english
ale
and
not
overly
enticing
the
taste
is
a
bit
metalic
in
the
middle
balanced
medium
bodied
a
little
sharp
maybe
a
little
bready
the
after
taste
is
very
sharp
and
imbalanced
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
hoppy
esters
you
can
really
feel
the
oils
in
your
mouth
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
but
not
my
favorite
either
lchaim
drinkability
this
is
not
bad
but
its
also
not
good
and
therefore
not
sessionable
golden
in
color
with
a
quickly
disapating
head
smell
is
honey
sweet
with
malts
taste
of
honey
malt
grain
and
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
carbonation
having
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
it
was
actually
better
than
what
was
expected
in
this
english
ale
nothing
special
nothing
terrible
worth
a
try
bottle
pour
cellar
temperature
into
a
pint
glass
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
not
a
real
winner
for
me
either
id
take
a
bass
over
this
anyday
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
english
ale
and
a
great
organic
beer
recommended
for
spicy
cuisine
sessionably
light
but
tasty
pours
a
redish
brown
color
with
a
mild
head
that
laces
quickly
smells
of
mild
hops
and
water
unfortunately
tastes
the
same
only
a
bit
more
hop
presence
is
noticable
but
more
water
is
noticable
than
anything
cant
even
tell
if
there
is
any
alcohol
present
its
drinkabitlity
is
pretty
high
since
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
ive
heard
really
good
things
about
this
beer
and
im
not
impressed
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
drinkability
not
a
great
representative
of
an
english
pale
ale
but
interesting
enough
to
give
it
a
whirl
well
this
one
is
decent
but
i
dont
think
id
get
it
again
im
a
silly
american
with
silly
tastes
for
really
strong
hoppy
beers
or
cheap
swill
try
these
just
to
keep
the
bottles
da
i
found
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyed
the
fact
that
it
is
made
up
of
mostly
organic
ingredients
very
interesting
flaskshaped
bottle
in
the
glass
it
is
a
murky
copper
the
small
head
disappears
quickly
all
citrusy
hops
in
the
nose
this
a
very
good
smelling
beer
the
taste
has
the
same
hop
character
but
the
citrus
turns
downright
lemony
covering
any
hope
of
malt
body
definite
bubblegum
this
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
for
me
big
time
taste
is
a
little
sour
lemonlike
light
spiciness
almost
a
farmyard
funkiness
clover
hay
grapefruit
like
a
sour
fruit
punch
id
say
and
the
carbonation
is
similar
the
body
is
less
thin
than
my
last
sample
as
well
this
is
a
little
lighter
and
less
malty
than
i
usually
prefer
but
its
not
bad
much
better
than
i
remember
last
time
i
had
it
a
nice
wellbalanced
ale
fairly
basic
but
pleasant
and
wellbalanced
would
make
for
a
nice
session
ale
first
beer
of
the
new
year
kicking
back
after
12
hours
in
the
er
pours
a
yellowishbrown
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
mild
some
hops
with
a
touch
of
diacetyl
flavor
is
well
balanced
the
hops
do
not
overpower
the
malt
and
there
is
definitely
a
diacetyl
component
fairly
drinkable
beer
if
a
little
thin
not
my
favorite
beer
from
st
peters
it
doesnt
taste
spoiled
or
anything
just
not
very
good
the
beer
came
in
a
medicine
bottle
and
ended
up
tasting
like
medicine
this
one
was
a
little
hard
to
finish
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
if
my
wallet
wouldnt
protest
great
looking
bottle
of
course
to
hold
a
decent
english
ale
and
organic
too
for
what
thats
worth
nothing
extraordinary
here
a
golden
orange
sorta
butterscotch
color
to
it
a
bright
white
coarse
head
not
a
lot
of
lingering
the
nose
is
standard
mild
grassy
hops
and
caramel
lots
of
pleasing
bitterness
at
the
beginning
of
each
sip
decent
malt
and
caramel
flavors
fairly
smooth
a
pleasant
if
unexciting
brew
d
a
pint
is
a
bit
much
i
am
having
motivation
problems
finishing
this
one
not
due
to
abv
which
is
quite
low
but
the
hops
get
to
be
a
bit
much
the
weird
thing
is
they
are
not
strong
in
the
sense
the
america
pale
ales
tend
to
be
strong
this
is
just
too
fragrant
and
that
carries
over
to
the
flavor
and
the
drinkability
i
doubt
that
i
will
have
this
again
but
it
is
worth
a
try
bought
a
half
case
of
16
9oz
bottles
i
was
impressed
when
i
opened
the
case
to
find
the
medicine
type
bottles
quite
unique
it
pured
an
offgolden
color
to
brown
to
a
quickly
dissipating
head
it
smelled
a
bit
off
is
all
i
can
think
of
not
too
sweet
not
too
hoppy
just
not
so
fresh
of
a
smell
the
taste
was
really
not
more
than
an
average
brew
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
with
it
had
a
creamy
mouthfeel
but
still
the
taste
and
the
off
smell
didnt
relinquish
to
a
satisfying
experience
i
dont
think
you
could
have
more
than
just
a
few
of
these
besides
the
price
39
00
for
12
bottles
you
can
really
find
a
better
english
brew
i
will
savor
the
remaining
case
to
maybe
impress
my
friends
with
the
looks
but
i
will
continue
my
search
for
the
perfect
beer
this
is
one
of
the
superior
english
bitters
ive
had
in
the
us
this
has
the
body
and
flavor
to
stand
up
to
a
typical
ipa
without
becoming
an
ipa
itself
d
not
bad
but
there
are
definatly
better
english
pale
ales
out
there
i
would
get
this
again
but
it
is
way
overpriced
for
something
so
mediocre
pours
clear
golden
copper
with
insignificant
head
and
sparse
lacing
smells
incredibly
sugary
woody
and
full
of
carmel
for
something
that
purports
to
be
a
pale
ale
no
hop
aroma
at
all
sweet
biscuit
malts
dominate
the
flavor
profile
a
touch
of
toasted
grain
in
the
center
before
a
fairly
dry
and
woody
hop
bitterness
sets
in
thin
and
overly
still
in
the
mouth
for
a
pale
ale
the
aroma
is
offputting
for
the
style
though
the
beer
is
ultimately
salvaged
by
its
reasonably
palatable
taste
pours
a
bright
marmalade
hue
with
fluffy
eggshell
head
that
dissipates
to
dusting
sticky
lace
is
left
behind
rather
faint
aroma
with
some
slight
mineral
notes
alongside
honey
and
yeasty
rising
dough
on
the
palate
orangey
yeast
up
front
and
biscuity
malts
at
the
midpalate
mildly
doughy
flavor
throughout
with
a
tingly
sweetandsulphur
finish
minimal
hop
content
just
some
subdued
earthy
balancing
hops
smooth
unassuming
mouthfeel
with
a
dextrine
character
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
flashes
of
a
brown
ale
with
touches
of
sweetness
throughout
the
flavors
nothing
special
going
on
here
unfortunately
as
with
many
of
the
imported
beers
in
the
lcbo
liquor
control
board
of
ontario
the
date
stamp
indicates
that
it
was
bottled
three
months
ago
it
may
seem
a
bit
unfair
to
judge
st
peters
when
the
freshness
is
questionable
but
as
i
have
no
plans
to
visit
rural
england
any
time
soon
it
will
have
to
do
very
smooth
mouthfeel
jetisoned
along
by
sparse
yet
fine
carbornation
quiet
drinkable
although
the
lingering
hop
bitterness
is
a
touch
distracting
overall
a
good
subtle
brew
slightly
lacking
in
character
will
buy
again
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
good
english
pale
ale
stay
away
if
you
want
something
really
complex
or
hardhitting
or
if
youre
afraid
of
fruitier
undertones
very
solid
english
pale
ale
smooth
but
a
little
more
spicy
than
i
expected
foamy
head
not
too
much
carbonation
this
is
the
way
i
prefer
my
pale
ales
id
take
an
english
over
an
american
style
any
day
but
thats
just
me
in
a
side
note
i
had
some
chicken
tacos
from
the
mexican
shop
on
the
corner
while
drinking
this
one
and
i
have
to
say
it
went
quite
well
with
it
even
after
getting
through
the
skunkiness
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
beer
just
the
bottle
st
peters
ales
taste
is
nice
thats
about
it
this
one
was
a
little
underwhelming
to
me
farily
easy
to
drink
as
there
is
little
carbonation
or
overpowering
flavors
to
burn
one
out
would
one
want
to
make
this
a
sessioner
you
could
but
i
think
youd
getr
bored
after
the
second
one
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
odd
in
every
way
but
good
drinkable
pale
ale
gotta
love
english
brewing
good
if
forgettable
worth
the
purchase
to
discover
how
flavors
change
with
temperature
and
for
the
medicine
bottle
taste
is
very
buttery
butter
esters
come
in
and
play
with
your
senses
they
are
very
present
shy
hops
presence
aswell
with
a
mellow
bitterness
folowed
by
a
malty
presence
ends
in
smoothness
with
a
watery
touch
drinkability
find
a
half
barrel
of
this
if
possible
slap
an
iv
on
me
one
could
drink
this
for
days
on
end
great
beer
bottom
line
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
a
vigorous
pour
only
resulted
in
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
at
first
was
malty
then
some
floral
notes
i
can
taste
the
malt
at
first
with
some
hop
in
the
finish
pretty
well
balanced
this
is
an
organic
ale
and
i
would
have
to
say
i
like
it
well
worth
a
try
however
i
still
will
drink
this
one
since
two
out
of
three
aint
bad
and
were
magnificent
a
pretty
good
beer
that
gets
lost
among
the
shuffle
of
other
good
english
pale
ales
solid
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
fair
retention
smells
lightly
hoppy
malty
and
earthy
tastes
similar
with
a
bolder
than
normal
hop
empahsis
lightly
herbal
and
earthy
and
perhapse
a
bit
grainlike
quite
clean
and
crisp
other
that
a
slight
butterscotch
flavor
and
feel
in
the
finish
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
this
overall
isnt
too
bad
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
halfliter
green
glass
bottle
in
the
style
of
the
late
18th
century
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
i
agree
that
the
packaging
is
eyecatching
thats
what
drew
me
to
it
it
poured
well
with
a
nice
amber
almost
copper
color
i
thought
the
smell
of
hops
came
through
very
distinct
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
bitter
for
the
first
couple
of
sips
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
has
a
nice
light
crisp
feeling
i
didnt
rate
this
quite
as
high
on
drinkability
just
because
i
dont
think
i
would
personally
drink
many
of
these
and
for
the
fact
that
neer
the
end
i
was
forcing
it
down
i
dont
mind
having
a
pint
of
it
but
its
not
my
favorite
ale
d
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
not
jawdropping
spectacular
but
certainly
wouldnt
mind
downing
a
few
of
these
on
occasion
m
d
a
lightmediumbodied
brew
that
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
it
could
definately
make
a
fine
session
beer
however
the
lifeless
appearance
and
disagreeable
aroma
of
this
brew
pull
the
score
down
a
bit
ill
have
a
st
peters
golden
instead
a
soft
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fizzled
out
and
left
behind
just
a
bit
of
lacing
aromas
of
apricots
peaches
and
bread
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
very
much
like
a
mild
american
ipa
or
an
american
pale
ale
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
with
a
fruity
finish
that
starts
off
subtle
and
mild
but
quickly
becomes
allconsuming
in
my
mouth
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
fruity
without
the
alcohol
or
malt
to
balance
it
out
and
add
richness
to
the
flavor
instead
this
beer
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
leads
into
a
fruity
finish
moderate
drinkability
due
to
the
flavors
but
the
abv
is
low
and
the
flavors
make
this
beer
somewhat
distinct
even
for
its
style
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
peach
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
earthy
grains
along
with
fruity
and
floral
hops
taste
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
a
light
fruitiness
followed
by
dry
crackerlike
grains
next
up
are
some
herbal
and
earthy
hops
along
with
some
lemon
peel
and
a
hint
of
a
metallic
twang
nothing
special
but
certainly
worth
a
try
a
decent
flavor
smooth
and
light
to
medium
body
good
example
of
english
style
ales
it
is
something
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
at
a
time
and
not
get
sick
of
creamy
white
head
laces
out
milky
sits
atop
a
thick
coalesce
of
amber
and
dark
orange
smell
is
a
little
skunky
from
a
distance
but
ironically
becomes
floral
and
malty
on
a
closer
sniff
instantly
tastes
grassy
with
light
bark
and
the
hops
show
up
a
little
late
creamy
and
bitter
good
but
not
great
i
likes
st
peters
porter
much
better
than
this
d
good
example
of
an
english
ale
i
would
definately
recommend
this
if
youre
sitting
back
on
your
couch
listening
to
some
music
i
was
listening
to
blackalicious
and
just
relaxing
you
could
definately
drink
this
throughout
the
year
but
i
would
recommend
late
summer
spring
and
early
autumn
i
wish
that
i
could
get
this
in
a
sixer
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
a
nice
version
of
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
great
bottled
bitter
with
a
great
hop
profile
its
very
well
balanced
and
an
impeccable
session
ale
moderately
hazed
pale
amber
color
a
little
yellowish
and
kind
of
dull
in
overall
appearance
head
struggles
then
fall
to
a
skim
fairly
quickly
nice
laces
however
complex
rings
and
falling
tendrils
slightly
hoppy
nose
here
a
bit
of
apple
skins
and
a
lesser
amount
of
balsam
mouthfeel
is
lighter
carbonation
falls
below
average
and
works
downward
nice
taste
actually
the
malt
is
subdued
and
lightly
grainy
and
the
hops
shine
in
a
english
manner
bitter
florals
and
black
pepper
characterize
the
impression
clean
finish
with
a
bit
of
verve
and
nice
balance
the
dying
carbonation
is
the
only
bit
of
a
letdown
in
the
finish
a
tiny
layer
of
creamcolored
oily
film
an
eversoslightly
hazy
orangeamber

the
nose
is
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
thats
all
same
up

butterscotch
through
the
middle
to
a

finish
quite
bitter

some

in
the

very
nice
very

with

almost
puckering
but
taming
with
temperature
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
light
foamy
lacing
raw
tangy
hop
aroma
hops
are
more
dominant
here
than
in
most
english
pale
ales
with
a
big
herbal
grassy
twang
to
it
dry
crackerlike
malt
backbone
keeps
the
hops
in
check
this
is
an
organic
ale
and
it
certainly
tastes
it
quite
a
departure
from
what
im
used
to
but
remarkably
tasty
and
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
another
gift
from
the
wife
kind
of
murky
red
pale
ale
color
smell
is
soaking
the
whole
room
with
flowery
hops
very
nice
smell
taste
is
good
a
mild
english
ale
with
a
heavy
dose
of
alphas
lighter
hops
in
the
nose
but
not
much
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
bitey
but
otherwise
good
this
would
be
a
good
session
brew
mouthfeel
is
watery
clean
not
much
to
brag
about
here
though
my
opinion
does
improve
as
i
drain
the
glass
organic
is
as
organic
does
but
it
really
does
nothing
for
me
tastes
like
a
good
solid
english
session
bitter
the
strength
is
a
bit
high
for
a
the
style
but
perhaps
that
helps
it
keep
better
in
the
bottle
very
quaffable
this
goes
down
really
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
best
epas
i
have
had
must
be
the
water
in
england
i
usually
smell
and
taste
some
metallic
notes
this
beer
wasnt
an
exception
but
it
wasnt
overtly
metallic
in
either
category
a
nice
session
beer
for
sure
personally
i
dont
think
this
is
one
of
their
best
a
bit
above
average
compared
to
say
bass
but
not
the
quality
of
others
ive
had
nothing
exceptional
but
easy
to
drink
a
decent
session
ale
but
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
pours
with
the
smallest
amount
of
head
possible
for
it
to
still
be
called
a
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
skunk
with
some
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
hop
spice
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
a
hint
of
metal
possibly
from
the
cap
the
carbonation
is
on
the
mild
side
this
really
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
beer
if
not
skunked
however
with
a
green
bottle
i
dont
forsee
ever
finding
an
unskunked
bottle
around
here
none
of
the
skunky
smell
i
got
with
another
of
the
st
petes
offerings
very
light
taste
aroma
goes
down
nice
and
easylike
its
easy
to
envision
men
sitting
around
in
a
pub
hundreds
of
years
ago
drinking
one
after
another
of
this
brew
alchohol
comes
in
at
a
mere
4
5
making
this
all
the
more
easy
to
sit
back
and
session
can
you
say
average
coppertinged
amber
ale
topped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
theres
a
mild
english
hop
note
wrapped
in
a
bit
of
skunky
aroma
the
flavor
is
fairly
neutral
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
nothing
really
outstanding
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
lack
of
real
enjoyable
flavor
makes
it
technically
drinkable
but
nothing
to
savor
all
around
an
average
inoffensive
beer
pours
a
orangered
color
with
a
hazy
glow
the
head
is
white
and
sticky
smells
of
dry
grains
light
fruity
hops
and
mineral
water
the
mineral
water
is
the
first
thing
i
noticed
along
with
a
lemony
light
hops
followed
by
a
dry
bread

not

is
a
very
worthy
english
pale
ale
pours
a
rather
dull
amberorange
colour
minimal
head
after
a
hard
pour
seems
characteristic
of
st
peters
brews
just
not
too
appetizing
aroma
of
malt
slight
diacetyl
and
some
grain
and
hops
taste
was
average
for
an
english
ale
a
mix
of
the
traditional
malts

twang
in
the

low
carbonation
medium
bodied
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
finish

dry

slightly
bitter
not
one
of
their
best
overall
a
solid
effort
from
st
peters
whilst
some
of
their
offerings
suffer
from
low
carbonation
poor
nose
andor
low
mouthfeel

this
one
excels
all
round
one
of
the
better
st
peters
brews
i
love
the
bottle
but
the
beer
within
that
bottle
while
not
deserving
of
scorn
doesnt
deserve
much
praise
either
st
peters
english
ale
is
a
gardenvariety
pale
that
could
use
more
body
more
flavor
and
fewer
bubbles
most
good
pale
ales
have
nothing
to
fear
drinkability

this
ale
is
nice
easy
and
even
the
finish
especially
is
long
and
drawn
out

meant
to
be
savored

finish
this
is
my
first
organic
ale
and
im
not
really
impressed
its
oknot
great
but
not
horrible
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
it
has
a
good
hop
character
a
sweet
malt
taste
overall
this
is
what
bass
wishes
it
was
pours
a
deep
gold
color
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
faint
theres
some
grassy
and
hoppy
aromas
the
taste
is
fairly
grassy
with
a
decent
hop
and
malt
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
light
and
oily
the
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
at
4
5
abv
just
an
average
pale
500
ml
green
bottle
with
clearly
marked
production
date
on
the
back
label
a
very
good
english
ale
unique
bottle
expensive
price
pours
out
to
an
orange
colour
short
head
not
much
of
a
presentation
but
the
flavor
is
really
quite
good
with
overtones
of
burnt
hops
and
barley
but
goes
down
very
smooth
this
is
a
good
brew
for
those
interested
in
trying
something
new
recommended
nice
light
orange
liquid
very
little
head
less
than
a
finger
worth
that
quickly
disipated
to
nothingness
what
lace
that
is
left
creeps
down
to
the
bottom
at
a
rapid
rate
bit
bitter
smelling
grassy
earthy
hops
coinciding
with
a
dry
malt
taste
is
a
tad
sweeter
than
scent
a
dry
baked
malt
with
a
dominant
bitter
taste
aftertaste
is
grassy
medium
body
crisp
mouthfeel
causes
alot
of
burping
i
must
say
not
a
bad
beer
its
been
a
rough
day
watching
the
red
sox
so
im
hoping
for
a
pick
me
up
i
love
the
flask
shape
bottle
and
the
simple
classic
label
but
other
than
that
the
appearance
is
fairly
average
there
is
almost
no
head
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
though
this
is
not
uncommon
for
english
pas
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
golden
amber
not
an
overly
aromatic
beer
but
does
smell
faintly
earthydustymusty
actually
kind
of
like
an
english
tavern
the
taste
is
subtly
malty
and
not
overly
hoppy
again
fairly
traditional
for
epa
not
overly
complex
but
tasty
and
enhanced
by
the
nice
light
bitter
finish
this
was
fairly
light
bodied
and
not
very
carbonated
i
wonder
how
much
of
that
is
due
to
original
craftsmanship
versus
shipping
to
colorado
with
no
freshness
date
i
have
no
way
to
know
overall
a
good
solid
pale
ale
that
i
enjoyed
but
was
not
great
enough
to
improve
my
mood
very
much
out
of
its
unique
bottle
that
looks
like
it
came
out
of
my
grandmothers
medicine
cabinet
this
ale
pours
a
golden
honey
color
with
just
a
hint
of
cloudiness
and
a
thin
white
head
the
immediate
smell
is
slightly
skunky
like
heinikken
and
on
closer
inspection
i
admit
i
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
either
that
or
this
is
just
not
a
good
brew
metallic
bitter
ill
have
to
update
this
review
later
when
i
try
another
bottle
how
do
i
kill
a
review
soil
association
organic
certification
these
boys
mean
business
with
their
organic
grown
items
poured
out
a
goldencopper
color
with
some
carbonation
that
was
visible
ive
noticed
that
they
dont
have
that
much
carbonation
in
their
beers
that
is
visible
but
it
is
in
the
taste
smell
was
very
raw
like
hops
hit
the
nose
as
well
as
earth
tones
and
caramel
blended
in
together
perhaps
a
few
nuts
in
there
for
good
measure
taste
was
to
the
point
which
i
liked
starts
out
to
be
very
smooth
and
drinkable
hops
grain
and
barley
all
hit
the
palate
with
some
sweet
malts
finishing
the
job
towards
the
end
next
time
ill
know
what
to
pick
for
an
english
ale
bass
or
st
peters
bass
or
st
peters
should
be
an
easy
answer
deep
cloudy
amber
color
nice
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disappears
malty
bready
aroma
sweet
caramel
malty
flavor
the
mild
hop
flavor
stands
out
in
the
end
with
a
nice
clean
finish
light
to
medium
body
with
a
kind
of
watery
mouthfeel
pretty
tasty
and
easy
drinking
drinkability
yes
sir
all
day
any
day
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
smallish
14
white
head
above
the
golden
brew
head
more
or
less
promptly
fades
into
a
thin
layer
of
film
although
lacing
is
good
somehow
the
slight
aroma
is
of
light
malts
but
seems
more
dominated
by
hops
taste
is
dominated
by
bitterness
with
a
slight
amount
of
malt
evident
to
dull
the
edges
a
bit
a
kind
of
metallic
aftertaste
sort
of
detracts
from
the
experience
but
the
brew
remains
drinkable
nonetheless
drinkability
is
pretty
high
first
real
experience
with
organic
and
would
really
like
to
try
on
draught
to
get
full
experience
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
slight
malt
feel
with
a
bitter
breadlike
scent
the
taste
is
decent
but
nothing
special
it
tastes
quite
bitter
and
watered
down
it
has
a
breadlike
finish
that
blends
well
with
the
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
this
is
a
weak
tasting
english
ale
im
not
a
big
fan
its
one
and
done
for
me
i
like
the
flask
like
bottles
that
the
beer
comes
in
it
is
a
light
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
faint
traces
of
hops
there
is
s
light
taste
of
anise
amidst
the
fruityflowery
notes
it
finishes
with
a
nice
bitterness
and
a
linering
taste
of
marmalade
pours
a
pleasant
hazy
light
orange
color
despite
the
minimal
head
topping
this
one
what
remains
forms
a
fine
tight
lace
soft
sweet
malts
characterize
the
smell
a
bit
of
a
scotchy
twang
is
present
as
well
soft
mouthfeel
at
the
onset
with
a
quick
crush
of
hops
that
gives
way
to
a
sweet
somewhat
grassy
malt
base
rather
watery
with
something
of
a
metallic
taste
that
seems
to
fade
as
time
goes
on
this
one
got
noticeably
better
as
the
glass
emptied
nice
brew
to
expensive
to
drink
all
the
time
though
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
small
light
head
nice
and
smooth
hoppy
and
malty
all
in
one
a
well
balanced
pale
ale
the
flavor
is
quite
interesting
and
very
pleasent
im
so
glad
that
good
organic
beers
are
starting
to
become
available
in
the
area
certainly
a
beer
that
i
plan
on
revisiting
id
like
this
for
a
session
beer
but
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
steep
for
that
but
well
worth
it
reccommend
this
beer
and
brewery
up
next
is
the
st
peters
porter
ooohh
oh
boy
here
is
another
case
of
a
really
really
unique
bottle
with
a
moderatly
unique
beer
inside
seriously
given
the
right
environment
this
beer
could
be
fantastic
im
just
not
sure
what
that
environment
is
it
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
brown
coloring
mostly
noticable
in
the
head
the
smell
was
pretty
bold
i
wasnt
sure
what
flavors
were
hitting
my
nose
i
do
know
that
it
tasted
very
good
it
was
pretty
heavy
and
i
appreciated
that
this
beer
had
some
body
all
and
all
a
good
beer
couldnt
drink
it
all
the
time
but
id
drink
it
again
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
wish
there
was
more
to
the
flavor
profile
and
a
bit
more
character
very
distinctive
bottle
sort
of
dark
olive
green
and
reminds
me
of
an
old
medicine
bottle
with
its
rounded
flask
shape
a
sticker
on
the
front
about
the
shape
and
size
of
an
egg
very
little
head
formed
even
less
remained
no
lacing
nice
aroma
fairly
typical
for
the
style
as
is
the
taste
think
bass
ale
with
a
bit
less
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
i
noticed
that
this
increased
slightly
as
it
warmed
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
ill
gladly
try
others
from
this
brewery
if
i
can
find
them
as
well
as
have
this
one
again
at
the
next
opportunity
nice
golden
brew
with
a
medium
head
this
is
another
of
your
average
english
ale
with
nice
hops
and
a
very
refreshing
taste
nothing
too
distincitve
about
this
one
except
that
the
bottle
is
pretty
cool
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wont
necessarly
be
looking
for
it
could
easily
pass
for
a
mild
style
rather
sharp
caramel
malt
aroma
lackluster
toasted
malt
flavors
hopping
not
much
to
speak
of
even
taking
this
a
mild
it
lacks
the
richness
that
the
malt
could
lend
a
bit
thin
and
watery
nothing
unpleasant
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
either
drinkability
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
i
would
not
want
to
this
organic
ale
pours
a
deep
ambercopperish
color
the
head
is
reminiscent
of
a
caskconditioned
ale
in
that
the
bubbles
are
mainly
large
and
airy
the
head
thins
to
a
light
rimmed
coating
the
lace
sticks
in
trails
and
webs
the
malty
aroma
mixes
with
tea
and
citrusy
smells
and
fades
slowly
into
sweet
malt
the
malt
is
lightly
grainy
and
caramel
sweet
the
hops
possess
a
tealike
and
lightly
citrus
bitterness
the
slight
metallic
tang
can
be
detected
toward
the
back
of
the
throat
im
so
glad
st
peters
has
made
its
way
across
the
pond
nice
to
drink
feels
good
on
the
mouth
the
whole
thing
comes
across
as
quite
mild
bitter
dry
finish
you
can
taste
hops
and
malt
both
but
neither
dominates
this
brew
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
fresh
and
slightly
malty
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
malts
are
apparent
and
there
is
a
hint
of
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
good
quality
brews
that
seem
to
be
straight
forward
and
balanced
well
reminds
me
alot
of
capital
brewing
just
across
the
pond
murky
amber
hue
one
fingered
persistent
creamy
off
white
head
leaves
sparse
lace
lightly
buttered
honey
drizzled
biscuit
in
aroma
is
accompanied
by
softly
earthy
hops
and
a
subtle
hint
of
caramelized
almond
mellow
toffeeish
sweetness
in
flavor
lazily
gives
way
to
stately
biscuit
and
bread
base
malt
notes
judicious
hop
bitterness
seemlessly
emerges
after
a
deliberation
along
with
agreeably
mild
butterscotch
which
longers
sufficiently
to
facilitate
a
balanced
buttery
undertone
to
the
lately
surfacing
simple
residual
sweetness
and
nutty
malt
combination
vaguely
woody
hop
flavor
the
low
carbonation
helps
wring
out
the
body
from
the
unfermentables
lending
a
smooth
quasi
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
soft
with
mild
notes
of
whole
grain
biscuit
enused
by
a
light
continuation
of
diacetyl
a
mellow
simple
well
balanced
bitter
with
a
firm
malt
backbone
st
peters
english
is
highly
reminscent
of
belhavens
st
andrews
ale
but
is
comparatively
a
couple
notches
shy
in
overall
character
tasty
and
a
fine
light
session
brew
a
nice
clear
copper
amber
brew
malty
nose
with
a
hint
of
hop
and
spice
definitely
a
balanced
hop
and
malt
flavor
to
this
beer
it
might
be
my
imagination
but
the
beer
is
clean
tasting
due
to
the
organic
hops
a
nice
hop
bread
like
feel
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
nice
beer
from
a
great
looking
bottle
this
is
an
ale
that
is
harbouring
some
serious
juxtapositions
very
unique
it
tends
to
catch
you
off
guard
but
in
a
good
way
worth
trying
a
few
times
at
least
to
pick
up
on
all
those
subtle
characteristics
that
tend
to
come
out
the
closer
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
by
the
way
save
those
bottles
ill
use
them
for
my
own
home
brew
thanks
thanks
to
putnam
for
the
sample
the
taste
is
exellent
begins
slowly
with
a
mild
hoppiness
then
esculates
to
an
explosive
bitter
finish
the
hops
dictate
my
kind
of
brew
recomended
i
thank
uglyradio
for
the
trade
like
everyone
else
i
really
liked
the
bottlei
had
the
saint
peters
bitter
and
liked
that
as
well
i
liked
the
nice
golden
color
to
itno
head
to
it
but
that
was
fine
for
the
style
smelled
very
hoppy
and
fruity
like
i
figured
it
might
be
nice
balanced
ale
slightley
sweet
but
the
hop
is
very
evidentvery
clean
tasting
nice
drinkable
ale
will
look
for
others
from
this
small
brewery
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
see
more
of
these
in
my
future
very
impressed
this
organic
ale
from
eastern
england
pours
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
quickly
it
has
a
deepamber
color
and
its
bouquet
sweetish
with
hits
of
toffee
the
nose
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
notes
of
apricots
but
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
back
of
your
mouth
the
flavors
are
smoky
almost
porterlike
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
showing
that
it
has
been
hopped
just
enough
to
balance
it
out
and
prove
that
it
is
an
english
ale
clean
and
clear
and
under
control
oh
the
horrible
references
we
make
all
in
all
a
reasonable
leftleaning
ale
drinkability
extremely
high
this
beer
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
from
a
handpump
it
would
help
with
its
lack
of
head
and
the
alreadygreat
mouthfeel
would
be
even
better
hazy
light
gold
aroma
consists
of
lightly
toasted
malt
shortbread
biscuits
and
subtle
hop
light
fruits
apricot
pear
and
some
red
plum
flavors
float
about
as
the
delicate
hops
interplay
with
the
toasty
malt
and
yeast
breadiness
a
solid
and
well
done
ale
even
if
somewhat
reserved
this
beer
practically
explodes
when
uncapped
its
almost
an
understatement
to
say
that
its
aggressively
effervescent
it
does
however
produce
a
nice
puffy
largebubbled
white
head
the
color
of
the
beer
itself
is
sort
of
a
hazy
orange
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
floral
hop
aromas
are
everywhere
medium
body
and
the
taste
is
almost
musty
and
earthy
with
a
decent
hop
finish
very
drinkable
and
certainly
enjoyable
id
certainly
be
willing
to
have
more
of
these
i
think
this
would
be
good
with
chicken
shallots
celery
carrots
and
peppercorns
in
a
stewpot
hazy
golden
with
wispy
head
that
dwindles
but
laces
the
glass
some
skunk
aromas
eventually
disappeared
quite
sharp
almost
fizzy
reminiscent
of
an
australian
sparkling
ale
perhaps
grasses
grains
earth
in
the
flavor
it
tastes
noticeably
different
an
organic
flavor
i
suspect
malts
are
bready
but
not
sweet
hops
come
on
strong
and
tickle
the
tongue
almost
puckering
effect
sharpness
with
a
metallic
hint
makes
me
wonder
if
bottle
has
been
damaged
by
light
bottles
are
neat
but
i
am
guessing
they
dont
protect
the
beer
as
well
as
they
should
a
very
earthy
ale
quite
raw
unusual
and
lacking
the
heartiness
that
the
best
british
ales
have
would
pair
nicely
with
some
crispy
fresh
vegetables
bring
down
the
cost
and
ill
become
a
regular
customer
otherwise
no
notes
mmm
organic
real
ale
this
is
the
good
stuff
for
sure
and
a
session
beer
at
that
really
solid
beer
light
copper
in
color
fairly
clear
and
a
nice
thick
head
when
poured
with
reckless
abandon
head
dissolves
to
clinging
lace
aroma
is
very
well
balanced
i
can
smell
the
malt
which
is
a
bit
caramellike
hops
comes
out
in
a
spicy
and
almost
citrusy
smell
some
yeast
aroma
also
present
but
i
might
notice
it
because
im
having
a
cheddar
cheese
sandwich
along
with
the
ale
taste
is
mild
sweet
malt
and
mild
hops
blend
incredibly
well
slight
metallic
tang
mostly
noticable
in
the
finish
beer
is
pretty
lively
on
the
tongue
even
after
a
hard
pour
to
create
that
big
head
i
believe
this
is
going
to
become
a
regular
in
my
refrigerator
fairly
low
alcohol
and
great
taste
combine
to
make
this
a
wonderful
thirst
quencher
for
most
occasions
the
organically
grown
hops
clearly
come
through
the
malts
are
there
but
this
is
an
english
ale
and
what
you
would
expect
low
carbonation
but
good
lace

all
the
swill
drinkers
at

were
impressed
with
the

one

even
took
it

apparently
she
has

overall
very
well
done
and

outlier
detected
justify
a
review
o
underrated
english
pale
ale
and
probably
bbcs
best
regular
offering
i
remember
enjoying
these
many
moons
ago
and
i
am
pleased
to
see
how
well
this
one
has
held
up
over
time
would
love
to
see
this
included
in
variety
packs
over
the
lager
not
as
good
as
the
very
best
english
pales
fullers
etc
but
solid
nonetheless
i
can
see
me
picking
up
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
year
later
edit
i
just
noticed
the
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
it
says
best
if
enjoyed
before
august
2014
oops
well
i
will
review
this
one
again
soon
when
i
can
find
a
fresh
batch
very
good
beer
good
taste
consistent
flavor
in
my
opinion
this
tastes
alot
like
boston
lager
just
in
an
ale
lighter
fare
a
wonderful
beer
for
me
especially
seeing
as
my
favorite
beer
is
the
boston
lager
cheers
medium
body
medium
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
residue
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
completely
over
rated
beer
i
hate
the
flavor
tastes
like
soap
not
bad
taste
like
an
ale
this
isnt
their
original
boston
lager
at
all
as
the
label
is
different
as
well
as
the
brew
this
english
pale
ale
style
brew
pours
a
pretty
clear
copperamber
in
color
with
about
a
12
finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
around
2mm
after
a
while
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
is
of
grains
biscuit
with
a
hint
of
caramel
also
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
a
hint
of
fruit
dark
also
finishes
just
a
tad
dry
but
good
actually
wasnt
sure
how
this
brew
was
going
to
be
overall
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
it
was
good
and
probably
even
better
on
tap
i
have
had
roughly
two
dozen
different
types
of
sam
adams
beer
and
this
is
in
my
opinion
by
far
the
worst
nearly
undrinkable
this
beer
is
a
disgrace
to
the
brewery
a
pretty
nice
ale
that
delivers
a
satisfying
easy
drinking
experience
when
youre
tired
of
hop
bombs
and
deep
dark
thick
ales
wont
cut
it
this
ale
should
fit
the
bill
its
always
refreshing
to
find
a
good
tasting
basic
beer
and
this
beer
is
one
of
them
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
tasty
o
loves
the
bready
caramel
sweetness
my
favor
interpretation
of
an
english
pale
thus
far
o
samuel
adams
boston
ale
is
a
simple
brew
that
despite
faint
fruity
yeast
esters
in
the
nose
borders
on
being
lagerlike
with
its
dry
and
crisp
finish
easy
drinking
and
delicious
malt
breadiness
balanced
by
slightly
spicy
english
hops
makes
for
a
nice
englishstyle
ale
worthy
of
a
pub
session
beautiful

as
we
only
get
this
and
boston

here
in
n
z
a
very
drinkable
yet
big
enough
body
to
not
disappoint
really
anyone
of
us
in
the
craft
beer
community
a
nice
bitterness
with
enough
of
a
sweetness
to
not
let
the
bitterness
overpower
the
overall
flavor
of
this
almost
red
ale
this
type
of
beer
pretty
much
goes
with
just
about
anything
o
good
drinkability
samuel
adams
expected
quality
recommended
o
a
easy
drinker
that
im
sure
i
could
have
all
night
but
definitely
nothing
to
call
home
about
a
solid
offering
for
those
who
want
to
tiptoe
into
the
realm
of
ales
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
ale
from
sam
adams
while
i
prefer
their
boston
lager
to
this
boston
ale
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
beer
ogood
session
beer
if
i
saw
boston
ale
in
stores
i
would
buy
it
here
and
there
pass
it
up
half
the
time
wouldnt
search
it
out
id
let
it
come
to
me
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
in
taste
and
feel
but
tastes
good
beers
of
this
nature
are
great
to
cook
with
a
good
underachieving
beer
that
you
still
root
for
to
get
better
if
only
it
were
timeless
overall
not
a
great
beer
barely
a
good
one
really
it
would
be
a
lot
more
palatable
if
not
for
that
really
prominent
tincopper
flavor
which
is
unfortunate
o
overall
i
was
hoping
that
this
would
equate
to
other
ales
in
the
north
atlantic
on
either
coast
and
i
was
not
disappointed
the
best
aspects
of
this
brew
are
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
i
can
see
buying
a
case
of
this
two
or
three
times
a
year
to
add
variety
to
the
stock
in
my
refrigerator
drink
it
regularily
when
outside
very
good
beer
near
the
top
of
my
choice
goes
nicely
with
a
pot
beef
or
with
a
beef
steak
for
that
reason
nicely
bittered
crisp
a
bit
sweet
refreshing
and
fresh
with
a
right
amount
of
bubbles
would
definitelly
recommend
during
autmns
in
sunshine
state
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
i
love
the
foundations
of
sammy
a
boston
b
the
stock
ale
is
delicious
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
with
12
finger
thick
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
scent
is
simple
hints
of
malt
mixed
with
bittering
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
even
ale
seemingly
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
the
lager
version
overall
this
beer
is
as
sessionable
as
they
come
a
great
standby
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
sam
adams
ever
since
i
had
my
first
pint
at
a
local
pub
they
tend
to
get
a
bad
rep
for
some
subpar
brews
that
take
the
craft
label
and
in
my
opinion
tarnish
what
craft
beer
can
be
for
newcomers
however
this
brew
make
for
a
delicious
sixer
at
a
reasonable
price
my
mind
sees
it
as
a
more
complex
and
sweeter
version
of
a
stock
newcastle
certainly
not
the
best
beer
on
the
planet
but
damn
good
for
the
style
bravo
sam
adams
so
i
dont
know
what
spices
hops
or
malts
are
used
for
this
beer
by
my
brains
seems
to
translate
the
marriage
of
them
into
a
sensory
reminder
of
ragu
it
wasnt
as
cumbersome
or
offputting
as
something
like
mama
mias
pizza
beer
it
was
actually
drinkable
and
not
that
bad
but
its
still
something
ill
be
leaving
on
the
shelf
next
time
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
ales
but
ive
had
a
lot
better
in
fact
ive
had
better
beers
from
samuel
adams
so
im
more
than
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
its
decent
but
forgettable
bright
copper
in
color
quite
clear
with
a
two
finger
head
after
the
pour
that
falls
to
leave
a
thin
layer
of
fine
bubbles
and
laces
a
bit
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
floral
hop
the
caramel
malts
are
the
leader
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
full
range
of
smooth
buttered
biscuit
tastes
the
malt
is
balanced
by
enough
earthy
floral
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
keep
things
under
control
and
from
becoming
overly
cloying
or
too
sweet
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
almost
creamy
in
the
mouth
due
to
the
perfect
level
of
carbonation
and
its
malty
nature
in
the
end
this
is
a
really
great
session
beer
not
challenging
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
that
is
part
of
what
makes
this
so
good
it
is
simply
a
great
ale
that
you
could
literally
drink
all
day
without
tiring
of
it
tastefeel
really
a
sweet
ale
on
the
front
but
then
the
bitterness
comes
in
and
its
an
odd
bitterness
im
not
sure
what
i
mean
by
that
but
its
almost
the
metallic
bitterness
that
i
get
in
canned
beers
that
have
adjuncts
i
dont
get
it
on
every
sip
but
when
it
comes
in
i
dont
care
for
it
that
much
the
feel
on
this
one
is
very
good
makes
this
beer
super
drinkable
medium
carbonation
and
a
mediumlight
body
with
it
after
taste
is
a
lot
like
boston
lager
with
crackery
flavors
to
be
honest
i
prefer
boston
ale
to
boston
lager
im
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
really
really
nice
and
for
a
super
reasonable
price
overall
a
pretty
good
ale
a
bit
more
of
earthy
and
herbal
hop
then
that
standard
ale
but
nothing
totally
out
of
the
ordinary
a
robust
malty
take
on
an
english
pale
ale
its
similar
to
boston
lager
in
its
overall
flavor
profile
malt
forward
but
still
nicely
hopped
while
a
far
cry
from
englands
finest
this
is
a
wellmade
english
style
ale
overall
its
tasty
but
for
a
stock
sam
adams
i
prefer
the
lager
o
not
bad
but
not
memorable
something
i
would
order
at
a
boston
bar
with
terrible
beer
options
o
very
good
straight
up
ale
right
here
like
it
a
lot
wish
sa
would
push
it
a
little
more
they
do
a
lot
of
solid
six
packs
that
often
slip
my
mind
black
lager
cream
stout
and
this
it
might
seem
a
little
boring
but
if
i
was
at
a
party
and
they
were
serving
this
i
would
go
back
again
and
again
cheers
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
good
flavors
and
relatively
low
abv
reminds
me
of
the
local
ales
i
drank
when
in
the
uk
well
balanced
o
definitely
follows
the
english
style
more
than
the
american
style
but
not
bad
overall
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
solid
stock
ale
i
actually
really
like
this
one
o
meh
its
completely
middle
of
the
road
in
every
way
imaginable
not
too
far
off
from
boston
lager
in
terms
of
a
similar
flavor
profile
but
somehow
not
as
enjoyable
just
an
average
beer
in
all
aspects
o
not
bad
however
i
think
i
would
only
have
this
again
on
tap
overall
i
liked
this
one
pretty
well
i
think
my
issue
is
that
there
are
simply
beers
i
like
better
than
this
one
not
saying
it
is
poorly
brewed
but
i
probably
would
choose
another
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
refreshing
but
maybe
a
little
sweet
medium
body
light
prickly
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
from
sam
adams
good
session
beer
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
overall
its
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
its
very
enjoyable
and
i
will
purchase
it
again
i
enjoy
the
caramel
and
herbal
hop
taste
and
aroma
12oz
bottle
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
tall
frothy
ivory
head
that
holds
excellent
retention
and
leaves
lacing
rings
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aromas
are
malty
bready
caramel
herbal
hop
tastes
are
nutty
earthy
caramel
herbal
hop
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sharp
and
crisp
overall
loved
the
appearance
of
this
one
decent
apa
and
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
redcopper
in
color
minimal
lacing
smell
is
mostly
buiscity
malts
molasses
rasins
tastes
is
similar
nice
smooth
breadyness
very
similar
to
boston
lager
but
a
bit
less
roasted
and
more
spicey
with
a
little
more
of
a
citrus
hop
kick
as
opposed
to
grassy
hop
kick
minimal
hops
though
one
of
the
weaker
ones
in
the
lineup
overall
this
one
is
much
more
drinkable
than
boston
lager
the
flavor
and
hop
character
is
better
than
expected
as
i
feel
this
is
the
best
yearround
samuel
adams
beer
overall
drinkability
i
think
overall
its
just
okay
on
the
good
side
very
nice
lacing
but
a
bit
of
a
weak
color
and
a
good
mouthfeel
on
the
weak
side
smell
is
weak
almost
non
existent
and
the
taste
is
balanced
but
not
good
enough
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
aroma
so
just
okay
drinkability
i
cant
see
getting
this
again
oh
well
not
every
beer
can
be
great
this
is
an
easy
drinking
apa
but
it
lacks
the
depth
and
character
of
some
of
the
others
on
the
market
the
caramel
is
overly
sweet
and
a
bit
sticky
and
the
hops
are
more
subtle
and
cant
stand
up
to
the
sweetness
overall
its
not
bad
but
there
are
better
cheers
this
is
truly
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
a
fresh
6
pack
of
boston
ale
the
palate
however
isnt
quite
there
opening
with
a
surprising
level
of
hop
flavor
with
rose
water
green
leaves
and
twigs
it
does
take
me
by
surprise
the
midpalate
follows
with
some
malt
character
not
quite
as
balanced
as
on
the
nose
biscuit
caramel
and
vienna
malt
are
present
though
it
does
feel
a
little
watery
here
drying
and
quite
bitter
on
the
finish
with
dried
herbs
and
a
level
of
hallertauer
bitterness
that
almost
seems
overdone
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
nice
not
an
apa
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
as
a
beer
its
a
success
overall
4
55
seems
to
be
what
buds
american
ale
was
aiming
for
but
of
course
done
to
samuel
adams
level
of
quality
all
i
would
ask
of
this
beer
would
be
a
tiny
bit
more
hops
but
its
quite
wonderful
as
is
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
boston
lager
but
not
quite
as
clean
and
crisp
the
flavor
profiles
are
quite
similar
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
i
would
really
seek
out
again
pours
deep
amber
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
theres
a
strong
aroma
of
malt
the
sweet
malt
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
theres
a
pleasant
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
drinkable
beer
from
start
to
finish
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweet
gingerbread
like
malt
in
the
taste
a
small
sweetness
that
rides
through
the
mellow
maltiness
of
gingerbread
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
spice
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
spicy
but
just
about
average
for
an
ale
o
this
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
a
solid
choice
when
faced
with
the
decision
between
this
and
some
piece
of
crap
bmcwhatever
choose
this
beer
every
time
o
this
style
was
always
my
favorite
of
the
sa
line
when
i
was
just
getting
into
craft
beers
havent
tried
it
in
a
few
years
its
still
a
great
beer
very
sessionable
wonder
why
its
not
as
readily
available
as
all
the
other
sa
flavors
ill
be
having
more
soon
a
pretty
solid
and
simple
straightforward
brew
from
the
sam
adams
gang
overy
disappointing
it
seems
or
am
i
just
hoping
that
the
beer
was
not
fresh
as
it
would
explain
the
lack
of
hops
and
the
malt
presence
o
pretty
damn
good
stuff
this
is
a
good
go
to
beer
if
nothing
else
better
is
available
not
to
say
this
beer
cant
stand
amongst
the
greats
appearance
is
amber
light
and
clear
smell
is
smooth
and
clean
to
the
nose
this
is
a
nicely
hopped
apa
the
mouthfeel
is
great
with
the
right
balance
of
hops
and
is
lingers
well
wow
taste
is
well
blended
and
hit
the
tongue
in
all
the
right
places
overall
this
is
a
well
brewed
american
pale
ale
one
worth
having
in
the
fridge
this
brew
will
leave
you
wanting
more
eat
some
peanuts
overall
an
excellent
brew
and
something
to
grab
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
malty
cheap
and
good
o
pretty
good
overall
good
to
session
and
watch
the
nucks
beat
bruins
with
i
poured
this
carmel
colored
concoction
right
after
i
finished
a
dogfish
60
minute
ipa
it
was
a
terrific
transition
sam
ale
had
a
cherry
malt
sweetness
that
i
dont
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
if
i
didnt
start
with
an
ipa
great
head
and
lacing
sudsy
mouthfeel
an
all
around
great
brew
i
will
keep
it
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
overall
i
was
excited
to
try
the
original
beer
made
by
samuel
adams
its
not
bad
overy
decent
this
is
not
meant
to
be
extravagant
its
their
go
to
beer
and
it
does
a
good
job
as
just
that
i
like
this
beer
simply
because
its
a
very
malty
beer
that
i
enjoy
drinking
it
seems
to
be
a
beer
for
anybody
whether
you
like
extra
hops
or
whatever
i
normally
like
extra
hoppiness
but
this
has
little
of
that
but
i
still
really
like
it
by
the
way
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
not
harsh
so
its
very
smooth
give
this
one
a
try
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
and
a
lightly
sweet
aftertaste
an
underrated
beer
from
sam
adams
which
is
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
detected
taste
is
also
very
mild
some
malts
very
lightly
hopped
not
very
big
on
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
more
just
ok
stuff
from
sa
that
being
said
this
beer
has
no
real
flaws
and
i
feel
like
it
would
be
excellent
on
cask
ill
keep
on
the
lookout
for
that
the
beer
is
transparent
and
orange
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
offering
faint
scents
of
lightly
sweetened
malts
biscuits
bread
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
bready
and
malty
with
only
a
light
hop
presence
evident
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
most
exciting
flavor
i
would
prefer
a
bit
less
sweetness
in
favor
of
some
hop
bitterness
andor
biscuit
flavors
decent
feel
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
try
though
i
prefer
the
samuel
adams
boston
lager
solid
not
must
have
pours
an
amber
color
thats
clear
with
some
head
that
dissipates
relatively
soon
not
instant
but
certainly
not
holding
on
for
too
long
smells
like
a
sam
adams
nothing
too
special
but
better
than
a
generic
lager
the
taste
really
holds
up
on
this
beer
its
very
balanced
and
while
theres
not
all
that
much
going
on
except
for
some
caramel
malts
is
never
fads
during
the
mouthful
nor
does
it
taste
to
watery
i
dont
usually
drink
the
boston
ale
as
i
prefer
to
go
for
something
that
has
more
flavor
but
this
beer
really
holds
up
and
doesnt
fall
apart
which
i
find
to
be
quite
rare
for
a
generic
nonflavored
ale
certainly
something
to
have
around
for
a
refreshing
day
from
a
six
pack
poured
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
bit
of
creamy
white
head
pretty
standard
all
around
both
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
some
earthy
hops
sweet
malt
a
little
caramel
and
an
easy
drinking
medium
body
not
bad
but
not
much
more
i
usually
feel
like
boston
brewing
company
makes
good
drinks
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
its
just
so
far
from
being
special
and
memorable
its
not
completely
horrible
but
i
feel
bad
that
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
this
i
feel
like
i
have
to
give
the
rest
of
these
to
people
who
dont
have
taste
and
i
could
only
hope
that
they
enjoy
it
because
i
wont
orange
with
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
and
a
strong
caramel
smell
earthy
hops
biscuitcaramel
malt
some
bitter
hop
oils
i
found
that
it
became
too
sweet
throughout
the
glass
so
im
marking
it
down
a
bit
for
that
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
nothing
particularly
memorable
but
a
solid
classic
enjoyable
session
ale
o
i
think
that
this
deserves
much
more
praise
and
likely
gets
looked
over
due
to
boston
lager
a
very
balanced
and
sessionable
pale
ale
ive
had
this
on
a
few
occasions
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
go
back
to
it
overall
its
pretty
generic
ale
with
the
classic
sam
adams
hop
twist
the
crispness
and
roasted
malt
help
give
it
a
little
personality
try
it
if
you
see
it
o
a
solid
pale
ale
esp
if
hop
overkill
is
not
your
style
edit
i
didnt
really
like
this
beer
so
i
made
the
mistake
of
letting
it
sit
for
about
an
hour
warmer
this
beer
is
absolutely
foul
drink
as
cold
as
possible
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
balanced
ales
i
have
had
in
awhile
but
being
so
balanced
can
make
you
average
good
beer
all
around
rjt
o
overall
a
perfectly
passable
offering
yet
another
example
of
bbc
making
a
beer
that
is
a
great
introduction
to
a
style
but
with
little
risk
or
excitement
involved
the
appearance
was
good
a
nice
amber
color
a
fluffy
white
head
with
some
light
foamy
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
a
little
hops
but
not
very
prominent
the
body
is
medium
light
with
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
some
malty
sweetness
followed
by
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
way
down
which
was
more
than
expected
from
the
smell
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
prefer
the
boston
lager
but
this
is
one
ill
get
again
an
easy
to
drink
tasty
beer
notes
this
version
of
an
english
bitter
is
a
great
american
beer
full
of
sublety
balance
and
flavor
this
is
two
thirds
the
price
of
fullers
london
pride
but
every
bit
as
flavorful
and
refreshing
widely
available
affordable
and
delicious
this
ranks
up
there
with
glbc
edmund
fitzgerald
as
one
of
the
great
contributions
to
brewcraft
i
love
this
beer
mo
crisp
and
refreshing
session
style
beer
with
great
aromaflavor
and
texture
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
beer
looks
pretty
clean
and
crisp
looking
the
smell
is
a
little
less
hoppy
as
the
boston
lager
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
good
its
a
little
bit
lighter
overall
its
a
good
ale
it
probably
wont
ever
have
the
popularity
of
the
lager
but
is
deserves
a
fair
chance
odnothing
bad
to
be
said
about
this
one
i
find
boston
lager
to
be
superior
to
this
beer
however
i
just
cant
see
myself
going
into
a
liquor
store
and
coming
out
with
a
sixpack
of
this
just
doesnt
wow
me
enough
but
if
anyone
is
looking
for
a
mellow
easy
drinker
give
this
a
shot
md
this
is
where
im
giving
big
points
its
silky
smooth
and
could
drink
this
all
day
very
enjoyable
this
was
decent
maybe
a
touch
too
earthy
and
bitter
in
spots
but
this
seems
mostly
well
balanced
for
the
most
part
and
the
crisp
yet
smooth
body
helped
keep
this
fairly
approachable
ultimately
though
if
i
was
going
to
buy
of
sixer
of
something
from
sam
adams
id
just
settle
for
their
lager
color
certainly
isnt
pale
but
rather
a
light
amber
head
is
fairly
big
and
lacing
is
present
smell
is
of
hops
and
flowers
and
there
is
actually
a
bit
of
a
roasted
smell
there
too
the
taste
threw
me
off
a
little
bit
the
hops
that
are
present
in
the
style
are
there
but
not
as
forward
as
other
types
a
bit
of
spiciness
too
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
i
think
i
would
prefer
its
cousin
the
sa
pale
ale
over
this
the
boston
ale
isnt
bad
but
perhaps
a
little
average
its
been
many
years
since
i
had
this
one
and
i
used
to
think
it
was
fairly
hoppy
no
more
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
more
often
as
it
is
a
tasty
sessionable
beer
something
that
is
getting
hard
to
find
these
days
d
only
gave
it
a
three
because
its
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
it
should
be
considering
the
low
abv
that
said
wouldnt
have
a
problem
doing
at
least
two
not
a
bad
beer
poured
into
a
tumbler
with
that
classic
head
to
be
expected
from
sam
adams
above
the
orange
copper
body
head
leaves
behind
some
lacing
a
little
biscuitymetallic
in
the
nose
with
a
herbal
hop
note
as
well
as
the
brew
warms
of
course
the
metal
fades
the
taste
follows
through
but
all
in
all
these
two
senses
are
mild
decent
body
with
good
carbonation
a
good
sessionable
beer
but
i
want
more
from
it
d
great
drinkable
beer
nothing
else
about
it
has
in
between
a
golden
and
amber
look
to
it
smell
of
some
caramel
taste
of
apricot
and
caramel
the
mouthful
says
it
all
a
sweet
feeling
and
taste
that
begs
you
to
drink
more
and
more
drinkabilty
is
fine
goes
down
easy
and
able
to
drink
a
good
six
pack
drinkabilty
very
heavy
but
drinkable
this
would
be
a
one
or
two
brew
very
hearty
summary
this
is
a
good
beer
i
gave
it
7
910
or
c
i
like
the
color
and
appearance
im
particularly
impressed
in
the
head
it
has
a
nice
smell
to
it
this
beer
works
my
appetite
up
and
makes
me
hungry
which
makes
me
think
it
would
be
great
with
appetizers
for
company
this
being
the
first
ale
ive
tasted
with
no
other
ales
to
compare
it
too
i
would
say
this
is
a
fine
ale
and
i
would
drink
it
again
defintely
a
quality
brew
to
quaff
d
i
had
2
and
that
was
enough
for
me
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
its
good
but
not
great
bought
this
on
a
whim
this
afternoon
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
lots
of
flavor
with
a
normal
abv
which
allows
for
maximum
enjoyment
with
minimum
revenge
later
on
excellent
a
very
drinkable
good
beer
that
isnt
complex
but
also
avoids
being
boring
this
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
but
i
would
certainly
enjoy
it
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
drinkability
certainly
aesthetically
pleasing
but
the
bitterness
ends
up
dominating
the
taste
although
the
caramel
malt
and
fruity
flavor
adds
mild
complexity
though
it
may
be
of
no
surprise
to
some
boston
ale
is
an
entirely
different
beast
in
comparison
to
boston
lager
which
is
a
good
thing
to
bear
in
mind
if
you
consider
drinking
this
beer
this
is
great
reminds
me
of
some
scottish
and
english
ales
more
caramel
malts
carry
the
load
here
hops
in
place
but
not
on
the
assertive
side
i
get
a
more
brit
style
take
on
things
here
minor
citrus
notes
tasty
and
highly
sessionable
ale
respectable
if
unspectacular
offering
would
work
fine
in
a
lack
of
higher
quality
craft
beer
pinch
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
straight
from
the
bottle
a
small
head
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
the
aroma
was
bitter
sweet
there
was
author
bit
of
hop
to
it
but
it
could
have
been
more
it
was
very
smooth
going
down
but
it
could
had
a
little
bit
more
of
something
else
a
sweet
caramelhoney
after
taste
that
lingers
on
the
palate
cheers
drinkability
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
but
not
terribly
complex
in
the
taste
either
not
many
surprises
but
again
nice
taste
i
enjoy
this
over
boston
lager
session
friendly
and
goes
well
with
burgers
and
such
under
a
finger
of
foam
settles
over
a
deep
golden
to
copperhued
beer
aromas
are
actually
more
european
than
i
expected
mildly
cooked
grains
come
to
mind
toasted
biscuit
flavors
are
a
bit
metallic
and
biscuity
caramel
sweetness
is
heavily
present
with
a
bit
of
warmth
this
beer
is
listed
under
apa
but
it
seems
like
more
of
an
english
style
not
sure
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
the
beer
gushes
upon
opening
once
calmed
down
it
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
grassy
and
citrus
hop
notes
the
flavor
is
biscuit
and
bread
malt
with
a
touch
of
grass
and
orange
notes
low
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
a
nice
beer
that
is
enjoyable
the
smell
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
and
it
has
a
very
nice
smell
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
but
would
definitely
drink
it
at
a
bar
or
party
with
limited
selection
verdict
an
enjoyable
selection
when
you
are
financially
limited
or
unable
to
make
the
pilgrimage
to
a
specialty
store
easy
to
drink
in
moderate
amounts
but
lacks
the
character
and
depth
that
i
am
looking
for
in
my
ultimate
choice
ale
regardless
a
decent
ale
for
any
average
runofthemill
beer
drinker
b
3
75
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
amber
with
a
small
but
long
lasting
head
aroma
of
mostly
earthy
hops
with
some
bread
and
caramel
malt
notes
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
flavor
starts
with
moderate
herbal
hops
which
faints
to
a
sweet
caramel
malt
lasting
finish
i
have
drank
this
beer
for
years
and
just
love
it
the
same
as
boston
lager
one
of
sam
adamss
best
beers
in
my
opinion
good
hoppy
flavor
without
being
as
bitter
as
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
that
i
normally
get
only
have
one
at
my
disposal
so
not
sure
about
its
drinkability
but
would
definately
recommend
this
one
to
ba
members
d
tastes
like
a
light
english
ale
to
me
there
are
some
interesting
flavors
though
subdued
easily
a
session
beer
for
these
reasons
but
i
prefer
something
more
vibrant
this
is
an
american
pale
ale
this
is
far
closer
to
a
british
bitter
in
my
opinion
its
a
good
session
beer
nothing
over
the
top
a
crowd
pleaser
would
score
higher
as
a
bitter
than
an
american
pale
ale
notes
interesting
to
finally
taste
and
rate
this
beer
which
i
did
not
see
in
stores
for
a
very
long
time
dthis
actually
has
a
very
thick
body
for
the
abv
itll
take
a
lot
to
get
you
drunk
but
it
doesnt
take
a
lot
to
fill
up
your
stomach
i
had
a
16
ounce
from
the
tap
which
i
enjoyed
but
i
do
not
want
a
second
one
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
but
far
from
a
great
pale
ale
this
one
has
good
flavor
to
start
with
but
then
finishes
just
tasting
like
well
beer
with
little
nuance
still
this
can
make
for
good
sessioning
and
is
a
step
up
from
the
bmc
norm
drinkable
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
drinkability
easy
as
easy
gets
not
too
bitter
not
too
heavy
you
could
drink
the
whole
thing
before
you
know
it
and
you
wouldnt
feel
bad
restocking
this
is
one
i
always
want
to
have
just
sitting
around
pours
a
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
malt
caramel
some
light
fruitiness
taste
is
malt
and
caramel
with
some
light
hops
palate
is
nice
med
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
caramel
malt
nicely
balance
by
some
light
hops
this
a
very
nice
all
around
ale
would
drink
again
cant
really
complain
about
this
beer
pours
a
nice
semidark
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
head
on
the
nose
slight
toasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
grain
the
taste
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
in
the
taste
with
the
mouthfeel
being
moderate
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
but
hoppy
ales
are
more
appreciated
in
my
book
d
the
drinkability
is
decent
it
goes
down
easy
and
its
pretty
refreshing
its
a
decent
beer
but
easily
forgettable
another
solid
bbc
beer
i
wouldnt
go
after
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
typical
apa
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
between
a
brown
ale
and
an
english
pale
ale
this
might
be
for
you
sam
adams
boston
ale
honestly
hits
about
the
average
mark
as
an
apa
and
a
beer
overall
it
is
flavorful
and
full
bodied
but
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
from
the
bottle
to
my
glass
to
my
mouth
yum
lovely
brownish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
color
is
a
12
on
the
srm
chart
head
is
a
light
tan
with
about
two
minute
lasting
power
light
lace
with
little
cling
aroma
of
honey
citrus
lilac
golden
wheat
sweet
malt
and
green
hops
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
refinement
of
wheat
citrus
malt
and
a
crisp
edge
of
hops
smooth
creamy
feeling
in
my
mouth
with
a
great
amount
of
tingle
one
of
the
better
ales
i
have
had
good
drinkability
widely
available
good
price
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
an
apa
albeit
a
little
different
from
others
not
as
hop
forward
as
some
in
the
style
but
very
balanced
and
well
puttogether
on
all
fronts
i
would
probably
buy
this
again
if
the
price
was
right
and
i
couldnt
get
to
a
snpa
i
might
like
this
better
than
boston
lager
too
ill
have
to
experiment
some
more
with
both
in
the
future
d
overall
this
is
an
ok
brew
but
nothing
special
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
whitish
head
that
laced
an
average
amount
smell
is
malty
primarily
caramel
malts
taste
is
similar
with
caramel
the
noticed
flavor
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
in
the
background
feel
is
quite
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
overall
a
good
beer
this
beer
is
a
refresher
and
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
if
for
no
other
reason
that
the
flavors
are
somewhat
restrained
and
how
cleanly
it
finishes
it
wont
blow
anybody
away
im
sure
but
i
approve
this
sam
adams
boston
ale
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
of
foam
it
has
a
surprisingly
light
taste
but
with
a
heavier
mouthfeel
it
does
drink
very
smooth
but
theres
just
something
missing
in
the
taste
its
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
here
and
there
i
would
basically
consider
it
a
high
end
miller
lite
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
i
could
genuinely
enjoy
drinking
this
regularly
a
watery
stock
ale
a
rather
odd
apa
i
have
no
idea
what
this
beer
is
not
much
nose
on
this
one
and
what
there
is
isnt
great
pours
like
most
sam
adams
large
but
thin
bodied
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
this
one
is
a
dark
amber
copper
color
taste
well
its
like
a
watery
stock
ale
with
some
european
style
pale
ale
characteristics
which
begs
why
this
is
called
an
apa
sierra
stone
and
every
other
great
american
brewer
is
doing
a
face
palm
at
this
being
called
an
apa
its
not
as
drinkable
as
youd
think
given
everything
else
and
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
off
for
the
flavors
i
just
feel
this
is
a
failed
beer
thats
got
a
lot
of
potential
boston
ale
poured
a
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
presistet
throught
out
the
beer
it
had
a
unquie
smell
very
hard
to
describe
the
taste
was
slightly
strong
very
unquie
not
too
many
flavors
to
pick
out
but
had
a
nice
initial
bite
to
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
for
the
new
palatee
overall
not
a
bad
beer
different
dwow
this
is
one
of
those
ridiculously
easy
drinking
really
flavorful
beers
thats
a
personal
favorite
when
i
can
find
it
recommended
sort
of
pours
an
almostclear
golden
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
scent
is
roasted
malts
with
a
decent
amount
of
barley
and
light
hops
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
taste
is
light
caramel
with
some
great
malty
flavors
the
hops
are
present
but
very
wellbalanced
i
feel
like
this
beers
flavor
is
extremely
complex
and
wellbalanced
i
get
some
nice
roasted
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
but
full
at
the
same
time
if
that
makes
any
sense
drinkability
is
quite
high
i
could
definitely
put
a
sixer
of
this
away
in
one
setting
d
this
is
a
beer
i
used
to
love
to
quaff
in
the
bottle
it
is
slightly
different
on
tap
while
the
malt
brings
to
mind
a
red
the
hops
are
full
enough
in
the
taste
to
justify
the
pale
categorization
a
tasty
brew
but
average
drinkability
wise
i
would
probably
choose
others
before
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
a
moderate
degree
of
carbonation
cuts
the
medium
heavy
body
and
the
lingering
orangy
sweetness
leaving
a
cleaner
than
expected
palate
and
lending
some
repeat
drinkability
in
this
otherwise
undemanding
and
somewhat
uninteresting
brew
well
i
think
id
say
this
may
be
better
than
boston
lager
or
at
least
on
par
for
what
it
brings
to
the
table
i
cant
say
that
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
or
the
rest
of
the
sam
adams
line
due
to
the
price
tag
but
if
i
had
no
other
option
at
a
bar
this
would
be
it
d
all
in
all
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
overly
complex
or
demanding
a
good
reliable
beer
decent
drinkability
a
little
heavy
but
crisp
would
get
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
prefer
most
beer
at
warmer
serving
but
this
one
shines
at
40f
as
many
beers
from
the
boston
beer
company
a
bit
too
sweet
but
not
bad
another
fantastic
brew
from
the
boston
beer
company
d
good
but
i
prefer
the
bold
grapefruit
rind
like
characteristics
in
other
apas
average
drinkability
id
say
not
bad
but
im
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
one
again
d
only
gave
it
a
three
because
its
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
it
should
be
considering
the
low
abv
that
said
wouldnt
have
a
problem
doing
at
least
two
nice
and
crisp
but
still
complex
for
a
lower
abv
beer
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
nice
copperorange
color
to
it
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
head
that
lay
to
a
nice
lace
around
the
top
the
smell
is
a
nice
roasted
malt
has
a
great
taste
that
is
malty
and
of
biscuit
this
beer
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
great
drink
ability
d
this
goes
down
well
the
flavor
is
very
light
but
still
quite
good
there
is
no
question
that
many
of
these
can
be
put
down
and
enjoyed
at
the
same
time
all
together
it
is
a
good
beer
however
it
does
not
stand
out
from
the
rest
of
the
samuel
adams
line
for
better
or
for
worse
it
has
that
same
signature
taste
that
you
expect
from
sam
adams
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slightly
fruity
undertone
the
hops
are
floral
and
grassy
and
lead
to
a
mildly
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
d
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
it
is
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
surprisingly
rich
for
the
alcohol
content
well
made
and
worth
trying
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
moreys
bottom
line
a
good
ale
nothing
flashy
or
extremely
memorable
but
if
your
looking
for
a
good
session
beer
with
flavor
this
could
be
your
huckleberry
d
pretty
solid
but
not
something
id
buy
extremely
often
would
drink
if
offered
to
me
notes
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
was
looking
for
more
after
the
promising
start
it
definitely
isnt
bad
just
about
average
pours
a
transparent
copper
color
with
a
good
half
inch
of
white
head
light
carbonation
and
light
lacing
has
a
slightly
hoppy
smell
and
taste
that
is
also
a
tad
bit
bitter
average
beer
with
average
taste
not
terrible
but
by
no
means
great
probably
wouldnt
drink
again
unless
it
was
the
best
thing
available
this
was
just
okay
for
me
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
like
for
an
apa
would
not
purchase
again
overall
boston
ale
might
be
the
best
gateway
beer
for
anyone
wanting
to
try
sam
adams
in
other
words
its
a
more
neutral
version
of
boston
lager
a
very
nice
everyday
beer
that
i
always
enjoygood
work
sam
this
was
the
first
craft
brew
i
tried
back
in
1993
on
tap
at
the
bull
and
finch
pub
in
boston
the
front
of
the
pub
was
used
in
the
sitcom
cheers
it
is
not
as
complex
and
heavy
as
i
remembered
it
back
then
but
that
was
hundreds
of
beers
ago
nice
and
malty
with
a
decent
hoppy
backdrop
though
a
bit
more
hopped
up
wouldve
been
nice
mightve
been
bordering
on
an
esb
then
that
does
speak
to
its
incredible
smoothness
and
balance
though
wonderful
medium
mouthfeel
with
an
easydrinking
quality
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
and
would
be
a
great
party
brew
another
good
brew
from
sa
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
fairly
refreshing
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
ive
certainly
had
more
impressive
examples
of
the
style
a
good
stand
by
if
others
i
liked
werent
available
a
solid
ale
from
samuel
adams
will
definitely
be
a
crowd
pleaser
caseworthy
to
say
the
least
light
body
slightly
bitter
but
thin
on
the
finish
a
solid
if
mostly
average
apa
pours
golden
amber
and
produces
a
multiple
inch
head
that
settles
very
gradually
leaving
a
look
of
softpeak
eggwhites
with
a
hint
of
tan
the
nose
suggests
yeast
and
hops
but
is
lacking
in
the
expected
ale
esters
belgian
lace
does
form
the
ody
is
mediumlight
with
a
modest
malt
and
hop
lingering
very
quaffable
but
uninspiring
i
will
not
decline
this
ale
if
offered
but
i
will
neither
seek
it
out
nor
order
it
drinkabiility
to
me
this
is
sas
best
year
round
overall
a
fine
offering
but
a
disappointment
for
me
i
greatly
respect
samuel
adams
as
a
brewery
of
massproduced
products
that
still
retain
the
taste
of
smallbatch
beer
and
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
up
to
the
standard
to
me
another
good
offering
from
sam
bought
the
mix
pack
brewmaster
and
ive
been
happy
with
it
red
colored
ale
nice
pour
the
foam
is
a
bit
obnoxious
or
at
least
on
the
one
i
just
had
good
taste
smooth
going
down
and
smooth
finish
taste
is
good
to
very
good
tasted
like
an
irish
red
to
me
but
a
god
one
seemed
like
a
classic
beer
for
the
city
of
boston
they
should
sell
this
and
12
packs
and
get
it
in
more
bars
here
are
st
pattys
day
drinkability
a
solid
beer
this
one
falls
squarely
into
sas
lineup
ive
found
that
while
most
of
sas
beers
arent
outstanding
they
are
solid
and
faithful
representations
of
the
style
this
beer
isnt
lifechanging
but
its
pretty
solid
pours
orange
copper
with
around
a
finger
of
cream
colored
head
plenty
of
retention
and
fairly
high
carbonation
evident
and
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
toasty
and
somewhat
nutty
with
a
bit
of
a
nondescript
hoppy
bite
in
the
middle
the
flavor
has
a
pretty
strong
balance
between
toasty
malt
character
and
some
bitter
hops
with
a
touch
of
earth
and
citrus
finish
has
bitter
citrus
and
earthy
cookielike
malts
pretty
well
balanced
yet
also
unapologetically
bitter
nice
flavors
moderately
full
in
body
but
the
carbonation
is
too
prickly
and
harsh
quite
a
balanced
ale
however
none
of
the
the
flavors
really
pop
or
tickle
my
palate
decent
brew
but
not
so
thrilling
golden
amber
in
color
and
a
thin
lacy
head
moderate
carbonation
provides
a
pleasant
mouth
feel
nothing
outstanding
in
the
aroma
some
minor
floral
notes
good
malty
sweetness
upfront
gives
way
to
a
nice
hop
floral
taste
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
lasting
combination
of
the
sweet
and
bitter
overall
this
is
a
nice
balanced
brew
worth
of
spot
in
the
fridge
im
not
quite
sure
what
others
will
say
but
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
boston
lager
aside
from
the
obvious
differences
between
yeast
i
found
the
overall
taste
to
be
quite
similar
however
i
think
that
the
ale
is
a
bit
more
smooth
and
a
bit
less
crisp
than
the
lager
im
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
in
the
future
i
would
love
to
do
a
sidebyside
tasting
because
im
not
sure
if
i
experienced
some
sort
of
memory
bias
during
the
tasting
d
in
a
great
range
for
a
sessioner
easy
to
put
back
and
while
not
terribly
interesting
its
a
good
beer
i
poured
this
bottle
into
a
glass
and
the
head
stayed
a
while
didnt
count
as
my
kids
were
driving
me
crazy
i
liked
the
taste
i
am
becoming
more
of
sams
fan
surprosing
since
i
remember
not
caring
for
sams
original
beer
that
much
but
the
last
two
ales
this
one
and
the
scott
have
been
good
i
got
this
one
in
a
12
pack
variety
model
and
am
enjoying
it
immensely
overall
i
believe
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
with
a
samuel
adams
label
once
again
im
perfectly
satisfied
i
plan
on
keeping
a
steady
supply
of
boston
ale
in
my
fridge
this
would
be
a
great
beer
as
part
of
the
transitioning
process
to
more
extreme
beers
for
a
less
experienced
drinker
for
me
its
simply
a
great
satisfying
beer
to
fall
back
on
and
it
always
satisfies
had
this
once
before
from
a
summer
pack
it
was
the
best
one
of
that
bunch
and
so
far
this
is
the
best
of
the
current
bunch
better
than
fat
tire
cheaper
too
d
could
have
a
few
of
these
just
not
sure
if
id
really
care
to
im
more
of
a
fan
of
hoppy
apas
and
this
one
drinks
more
like
a
lighter
amber
ale
not
bad
but
there
are
plenty
of
samuel
adams
beers
i
prefer
drinkability
this
beer
was
middle
of
the
road
for
me
but
sometimes
i
think
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
dont
think
every
beer
should
blow
your
socks
off
with
flavors
i
would
probably
grab
this
at
a
bar
when
not
feeling
adventurous
and
just
in
the
mood
to
pound
beers
with
some
buddies
o
who
labeled
this
an
apa
the
closest
style
this
beer
relates
to
is
more
like
an
american
amber
simple
though
enjoyable
beer
this
was
an
okay
one
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
but
it
was
fine
nonetheless
pours
orangeyellow
with
a
white
head
that
stays
and
stays
the
smell
was
fine
malt
and
bread
taste
is
very
bready
with
a
rather
bitter
aftertaste
carbonation
is
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
though
again
theyre
not
my
favorite
refrigerated
well
and
on
a
hot
day
i
think
it
would
be
the
best
way
for
this
one
in
the
chicago
market
ive
noticed
that
this
one
is
becoming
a
little
more
difficult
to
find
six
packs
seem
to
be
rare
although
i
always
seem
to
get
a
few
boston
ale
bottles
in
a
mix
pack
or
the
like
its
a
shame
since
i
really
like
this
sam
adams
classic
pours
light
amber
in
color
and
leaves
a
light
lacing
on
my
standard
pint
glass
these
are
very
drinkable
and
as
many
others
have
stated
i
wish
this
one
was
easier
to
find
on
tap
everywhere
i
go
seems
to
have
sam
lager
sam
light
or
a
sam
seasonal
white
summer
oktober
would
be
nice
to
see
this
one
make
a
comeback
drinkability
easy
drinking
ale
this
may
be
an
oldfashioned
american
stock
ale
light
and
refreshing
easily
drinkable
but
as
an
american
pale
ale
meh
phelpsfeb
15
its
incredibly
malted
in
my
opinion
and
it
really
shows
in
the
smell
it
has
a
sweet
caramelizedtoffee
smell
followed
by
some
earthy
pine
hops
really
well
balanced
in
the
smell
something
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
of
in
the
summertime
easy
and
mellow
beer
but
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
behind
it
not
a
bad
apa
but
perhaps
the
ingredients
suggest
otherwise

man
m
has
a

finish
with
some

in
the
backend
the
leaves
an
aftertaste
i
bought
this
at
walmart
price
is
nice
too
this
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
note
when
i
ordered
this
beer
our
waiter
told
us
it
was
very
similiar
to
a
sam
adams
this
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
red
harvest
color
the
smells
were
average
taste
was
smokey
woody
flavors
well
rounded
the
mouthfeel
was
a
nice
carbonation
and
great
silky
smoothness
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
pretty
good
definately
not
the
best
but
a
good
everyday
drinker
this
arrived
with
a
big
rocky
offwhite
head
the
color
was
a
beautiful
deepgolden
amber
the
nose
had
a
malty
sweetness
which
seemed
a
bit
odd
for
an
ale
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
nice
hoppy
bite
but
too
little
too
late
it
also
created
decent
lacing
throughout
id
take
the
bos
lager
over
this
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
rather
average
ale
definitely
a
bit
middle
of
the
road
in
most
aspects
not
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
but
not
bad
i
doubt
i
will
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
it
may
just
be
that
it
has
a
flavor
profile
that
isnt
my
favorite
as
it
seems
to
be
well
appreciated
by
most
pours
a
translucent
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smells
earthy
and
malty
taste
is
a
maltoriented
pale
ale
with
a
slight
lemon
twang
and
good
bitterness
the
hop
profile
is
earthy
as
well
full
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
a
good
session
ale
this
is
sam
adams
crowning
achievement
perfect
in
every
way
its
smooth
as
hell
going
down
but
has
a
lot
of
character
i
love
their
lager
but
this
is
a
cut
above
anything
else
theyve
ever
done
this
may
just
be
the
best
mass
produced
beer
around
this
and
guiness
are
my
two
favorites
if
i
were
rich
and
could
afford
to
drink
as

i

balanced
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
favorite
sa
brew
by
far
pours
an
orangeyred
amber
with
a
thick
sticky
creamy
head
hoppy
herbal
aroma
was
prevalent
medium
bodied
slightly
smooth
to
start
out
with
some
nice
fruit
esters
and
some
herbal
hoppy
taste
that
makes
it
a
little
bitter
this
is
a
beer
ill
always
come
back
to
it
is
basically
a
great

beer
definitely
even
better

boston
alestock
ale
is
my
favorite
everyday
ale
when
researching
and
rating
a
vast
array
of
ales
and
lagers
from
delicate
pilsners
to
overwhelming
imperial
stouts
and
barleywines
its
good
to
find
an
ale
with
which
to
refresh
the
palette
or
to
simply
enjoy
without
research
in
mind
yes
at
times
we
need
a
break
from
the
daily
grind
this
ale
has
a
deep
copper
color
with
reddish
hues
nice
malty
body
and
is
amply
hopped
the
separation
between
the
distinct
malt
and
hops
flavors
smooth
out
and
become
more
balanced
after
a
few
gulps
the
fresh
finishing
hop
aroma
lingers
theres
a
clean
fruity
finish
and
nice
long
lasting
head
now
ive
gone
and
made
myself
thirsty
for
one
on
tap
the
the
pic
in
tewksbury
pours
clear
amber
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
long
lasting
but
no
lacing
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
mostly
hinting
of
caramel
flavor
is
intenselt
caramel
maybe
overly
sweet
no
hops
to
speak
of
pretty
thin
mouthfeel
also
aroma
is
fairly
rich
with
a
biscuity
and
nutty
malt
character
the
beer
itself
is
an
orangeish
shade
of
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
and
a
slight
haze
toasted
malt
dominates
the
flavor
also
with
more
nutty
and
biscuity
notes
the
hops
are
fairly
mild
but
lend
a
bit
of
citric
and
earthy
flavor
to
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
lightly
dry
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
to
say
the
least
one
of
the
few
beers
that
has
any
kind
of
real
beer
flavour
at
most
pizzeria
uno
establishments
very
easy

drink

the

of

taste
this
good
pours

medium

comes
through
up

followed
by
a
strong

spicy

despite

the

only
has
a
mild
level
of

finish
is
crisp
with
a
touch
of

very
nice
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
i
went
to
a
friends
wedding
last
summer
and
they
had
this
on
tap
i
drank
it
all
night
then
recently
i
tried
sas
boston
lager
which
i
believe
has
gone
downhill
as
of
late
around
the
time
they
switched
the
labels
and
started
promoting
sa
light
well
i
was
a
bit
worried
for
sam
adams
but
someone
got
this
for
me
at
the
grocery
store
and
this
beer
is
still
doing
just
fine
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
last
summer
a
basic
pale
ale
with
quite
characterful
malts
severely
sweet
at
the
beginning
but
then
a
restrained
amount
of
hops
kicks
in
mellowing
and
unifying
the
beer
great
big
head
perfectly
tempting
aroma
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
fresh
and
on
the
warmer
side
very
yummy
a
fine
beer
that
anyone
could
like
i
would
like
to
see
more
brewers
age
their
pale
ales
to
get
a
mellower
effect
like
they
claim
to
do
here
koch
and
co
should
be
promoting
this
instead
of
the
light
or
boston
lager
nice
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
smells
of
malt
and
hops
are
very
clear
together
with
a
citrustone
mediumbitter
with
a
hoppy
slightly
roasted
taste
long
aftertaste
with
a
bitterness
on
the
palate
a
decent
ale
i
quite
like
very
drinkable
a
bright
white
head
on
top
of
amber
brown
color
with
light
orange
hue
similiar
taste
to
the
boston
lager
but
has
a
stock
maltiness
that
is
sour
i
kept
tasting
this
strong
sour
cream
and
onion
aftertaste
with
every
sip
maybe
this
one
was
a
little
skunk
because
i
have
had
this
before
and
i
dont
remember
it
tasting
like
this
what
a
great
overall
beer
inviting
amber
gold
with
a
hollywood

light
and
foamy
and
a
down

keep
things
in

the
second
sam

product
i
ever
tried

its
certainly
on

sweet
malty

light

slightly
watery

a
sweet
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
session
beers
to
be
found
anywhere
along
with
the
boston
lager
and
a
beer
i
look
for
if
there
is
nothing
else
on
tap
worth
sampling
the
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
color
the

the

is
perky
in
its
acidity
the
hops
quite
pronounced
in
their
bite
and
the
dry
lingering
aftertaste
adds
much
to
the
enjoyment
one
damn
fine
session
beer
and
always
a
treat
to
the
palate
light
amber
with
an
almost
orange
hue
and
a
thick
pillowy
creamcolored

aromas
of
apple
fruitiness
and
biscuity
malts
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
light
carbonation
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
grassy
and
earthy
hop
flavors
are
predominant
with
a
little
toasty
malt
for
balance
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
better
than
i
thought
it
was
tonight
but
its
still
a
dependable
pale
ale
you
can
jump
right
in
to
the
welcoming
smoothness
and
fine
maltiness
of
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
nice
and
rich
it
is
a
great
drinker
not
heavy
or
light
i
just
plain
like
it
sam
has
always
been
able
to
put
together
a
good
beer
and
this
one
did
not
fail
beautiful
looking
ale
reddish
amber
with
a
huge
rocky
head
with
excellent
retention
i
dont
pick
up
much
in
the
aroma
but
an
earthymalty
aroma
mouthfeel
is
quite
slick
and
leaves
a
strange
astringent
flavor
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
lots
of
malty
flavor
and
a
subtle
fruitiness
in
the
background
has
a
very
buttery
flavor
to
it
as
well
i
prefer
my
ales
a
bit
more
hopped
although
this
is
pretty
good
the
tip
of
my
tongue
feels
quite
strange
though
tingly
almost
interesting
feature
i
cant
believe
i
have
neglected
to
review
this
one
this
is
one
of
sammys
best
beers
boston
ale
is
tastier
than
the
lager
and
has
a
very
nice
hop
to
malt
balance
to
be
honest
this
beer
should
be
on
tap
over
the
lager
in
a
bar
pours
out
to
a
nice
amberbrown
with
a
malty
aroma
a
session
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
this
brew
pours
a
clear
brilliant
copper
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
with
staying
power
the
smell
reveals
a
light
twang
with
a
biscuity
background
the
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
earthy
grain
with
some
nice
medium
hopped
bitter
make
for
a
mild
balance
this
light
bodied
brew
finishes
a
semi
dry
bitter
and
drinks
down
pretty
easy
plenty
likeable

boston
ale
is
an
excellent
part
of
the
sam
adams
line
it
has
a
good
taste
it
isnt
bitter
smeels
and
appears
nice
also
not
overwhelming
flavor
but
not
watered
down
tastes
the
way
an
ale
should
has
to
be
one
of
my
all
time
favortie
from
sam
adams
the
boston
ale
poured
a
very
beautiful
copper
color
with
nice
head
retention
throughout
intriguing
lace
left
over
on
the
glass
too
slight
hop
aroma
but
nothing
that
jumped
out
at
me
or
up
my
nose
this
ale
had
a
mild
pleasant
hoppy
taste
with
prickly
carbonation
felt
on
the
tongue
definitely
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
and
a
decent
representative
of
its
style
a
very
nice
humble
ale
this
was
an
above
average
beer
in
my
opinion
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
boston
lager
but
i
am
a
fan
of
this
boston
beer
co
offering
boston
alestock
ale
this
beer
poured
a
wonderful
copper
colour
with
some
orange
highlights
the
head
on
this
beer
was
quite
large
and
remained
so
for
a
while
the
overall
head
retention
and
appearance
of
this
beer
was
magnificent
this
beer
had
a
great
aroma
a
nice
silky
mouthfeel
and
a
great
flavour
this
has
to
be
one
of
sam
adams
most
drinkable
beers
everything
is
done
right
here
this
beer
is
not
exceptional
but
it
is
everything
that
an
ale
should
be
beautiful
clear
copper
color
with
carbonation
evident
a
sticky
medium
sized
pillowy
white
head
sits
on
top
it
has
nice
retention
and
laces
nicely
as
well
theres
really
a
nice
hop
nose
on
this
beer
an
herbal
yet
also
perfumey
blend
which
melds
nicely
with
the
malts
on
the
nose
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
one
smooth
and
mellow
caramel
malt
profile
really
provides
a
nice
backbone
the
hops
are
equally
important
they
add
some
herbal
spiciness
a
nice
blend
body
is
about
mediumfull
very
drinkable

me
of
an
alt
in
some
ways
not
a
bad
looking
brew
amber

with
a
pizza
dough
sweet
wortish
aroma
the
head
on
this
was
impressive
the
flavor
fell
flat
though
imho
i
had
this
pegged
as
a
specialty
ab
product
similar
to
aruba
red
as
it
turns
out
its
being
brewed
by
bbc
so
i
wasnt
too
far
off
strictly
an
inocuous
amber
ale
a
notch
above
the
rest
of
the
macros
at
pizzeria
uno
a
redamber
appearance
colors
the
glass
as
this
one
is
poured
nice
head
although
it
diminishes
a
bit
too
much
as
you
drink
a
definitely
nice
hop
aroma
a
sweet
malty
and
slight
hop
flavor
smooth
and
calm
across
the
palate
but
noticeably
present
brewed
by
boston
beer
co
cincinnati
oh
good
stuff
the
hops
are
a
lot
more
raw
than
in
the
boston
lager
the
extra
dose
of
hops
are
balanced
nicely
with
a
carmeltype
sweetness
the
sweets
and
bitter
are
kept
in
very
good
proportion
its
an
ale
a
very
good
ale
through
and
through
i
like
the
lager
a
bit
better
but
this
is
a
very
good
brew
like
almost
all
bbc
products
its
top
rate
and
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
regardless
of
what
is
said
of
their
management
pours
a
bright
copper

with
a

that
leaves

down

a
great

maltiness
is
present
in
this
brews
nose
as
well
as
some
light
earthy
hoppiness
great
fruity
and
toasty
maltiness
form
th
character
of
this
brew
with
some
very
nice
slightly
bitter
noble
hops
at
the
end
very
smooth
and
fairly
creamy
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
th
bbc
hopefully
they
can
stop
embarassing
themselves
and
concentrate
on
making
more
good
beers
in
the
future

love

the

play
off

slowly
dissipates

a

a
very
good
beer
no
faults
at
all
this
is
very
similar
to
boston
lager
because
they
use
the
same
grains
the
hop
character
is
as
assertive
as
in
the
lager
but
somehow
smoother
and
spicier
due
to
the
english
and
czech
hops
and
ale
yeast
versus
the
german
hops
and
lager
yeast
in
the
other
beer
if
you
want
to
try
a
slightly
stronger
fruitier
more
complex
and
less
grassy
tasting
verson
of
the
boston
lager
this
is
the
one
this
is
good
well
crafted
beer
it
is
not
the
best
beer
of
this
type
that
i
have
tasted
but
it
is
very
respectable
in
my
opinion
mild
sweetflower
nose
golden
with
a
slightly
amber
hue
creambeige
color
to
the
head
big
bubbbles
medium
to
hight
maltiness
clean
finish
but
it
lacks
hop
bitterness
for
my
taste
solid
but
nothing
special
for
me
in
this
beer
for
years
sam
adams
lager
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
has
held
a
special
place
in
my
heart
because
sa
managed
to
combine
wide
distribution
and
still
maintain
a
consistent
level
of
quality
even
in
a
bar
or
restaurant
where
they
sell
bud
lite
by
the
tankerload
you
can
usually
count
on
a
bottle
of
sa
lager
in
the
cooler
for
some
reason
i
just
never
got
around
to
trying
sas
stock
ale
distracted
by
more
exotic
lures
i
guess
now
im
kicking
myself
for
ignoring
this
tasty
ale
for
so
long
solid
malt
and
a
respectable
hops
kick
nothing
over
the
top
but
quality
beer
through
and
through
this
is
by
far
and
away
my
favorite
beer
in
my
favorite
style
and
thus
it
is
my
first
and
only
perfect
5
ive
always
loved
most
of
jim
kochs
beers
but
when
ive
got
to
convince
a
doubter
as
to
the
quality
of
american
beers
i
tell
them
to
have
a
sam
adams
boston
ale
as
it
is
simply
world
class
the
beer
advocate
todd
a
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
when
he
said
this
was
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
this
is
a
mass
produced
almost
beer
you
can
give
to
the
greatest
beer
snobs
of
europe
and
convince
them
that
the
colonies
can
produce
a
unique
yet
world
class
beer
a
great
beer
everything
i
enjoy
in
an
ale
orangecopper
in
color
a
nice
sticky
head
a
combination
englishamerican
hop
aroma
and
a
balanced
malt
flavor
that
leans
towards
the
spicy
hoppy
side
an
quintessentially
american
style
ale
it
balances
everything
we
all
love
in
ales
into
one
brew
sound
impossible
try
this
stuff
good
solid
ale
that
i
have
always
thought
well
of
believe
it
or
not
it
is
not
a
regular
staple
in
my
fridge
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
comes
the
closest
for
me
to
english
ales
i
have
revised
my
opinion
of
this
brew
to
a
slighlty
lower
plane
while
i
still
have
a
high
opinion
of
it
i
just
dont
seek
it
out
all
that
much
in
fact
that
is
kind
of
what
johnny
p
said
about
sam
adams
beers
good
but
they
just
dont
inspire
light
orange
in
color
and
very
clear
the
head
retention
is
sufficient
enough
to
leave
a
lace
the
mildly
grassy
and
floral
hop
nose
is
accompanied
by
a
mellow
and
pleasant
diacetyl
note
as
well
as
crystal
malt
sweetness
yeast
esters
are
minimal
boston
ale
is
very
clean
all
around
in
flavor
profile
the
moderate
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
by
a
firm
maltiness
and
fairly
dextrinous
body
the
hop
flavor
is
quite
earthy
w
a
mellow
floral
note
and
isnt
overbearing
lots
of
biscuit
malt
flavors
in
the
somewhat
dry
finish
although
much
cleaner
and
less
estery
than
a
good
british
pale
this
makes
for
a
good
session
brew
if
youre
into
british
hop
flavor
presentation
packaged
in
a
brown
twelveounce
custom
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
syandard
pint
tap
glass
this
stuff
is
great
i
always
drink
the
lager
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
missing
it
pours
a
very
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
that
dies
pretty
quick
on
the
nose
it
has
pleasant
floral
hops
and
light
caramel
malt
as
well
as
vanilla
aromas
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
and
a
light
medium
body
and
malt
content
round
out
this
brew
grainy
long
smooth
clean
finish
an
average
ale
with
an
easy
drinking
character
not
too
complex
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
metallic
finish
there
are
better
beers
from
samuel
adams
10
boy
i
love
the
aroma
of
this
beer
initially
floral
but
then
a
citrucy
fruity
smell
comes
through
the
hops
arent
as
strong
as
youd
expect
in
the
taste
but
they
are
very
nice
good
maltiness
balances
this
out
perfectly
very
flavorfull
for
a
lighter
ale
an
excellent
beer
toptobottom
stock
ale
is
one
of
the
few
classic
beer
styles
to
have
originated
in
the
united
states
and
the
style
has
a
strong
new
england
heritage
stock
ales
were
brewed
and
fermented
in
the
traditional
ale
manner
and
then
aged
in
cool
rooms
called
stock
cellars
the
special
ales
were
called
stock
ales
because
of
this
extra
aging
which
gave
them
a
characteristic
body
and
smoothness
im
in
the
same
boat
as
gary
i
just
picked
up
a
six
after
a
manyyear
hiatus
and
really
enjoyed
the
beer
ill
be
back
for
more
sooner
next
time
it
has
been
quite
a
while
since
ive
tried
sam
adams
ale
had
to
try
one
on
my
way
through
boston
airport
last
weekend
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
while
not
great
it
has
something
that
will
bring
me
back
this
time
i
wont
go
six
years
without
having
another
a
light
taste
of
caramel
and
spicy
hops
execellent
smooth
ale
not
as
recognized
as
their
other
beers
goes
with
all
types
of
food
a
good
starter
beer
for
someone
trying
to
expand
their
tastes
to
full
bodied
ales
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
good
soapy
froth
aroma
of
buttery
toffee
bread
and
earthy
hops
mild
bitterness
and
very
much
like
an
english
bitter
soft
noble
hops
and
a
toffeebutterscotch
like
note
finishes
with
a
leafy
hoppyness
and
a
slight
tang
light
to
medium
bodied
feel
with
an
oily
hop
and
sweet
yeast
overall
a
mild
session
able
ale
with
a
very
english
character
5
00
overall
its
a
typical
pale
ale
dominated
by
english
malts
so
that
means
its
good
to
drink
but
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
i
got
more
than
expected
ive
definitely
had
better
pale
ales
but
this
is
not
one
i
would
turn
down
if
offered
i
just
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
or
seek
it
out
in
general
with
better
offerings
out
there
o
a
decent
beer
it
tastes
like
the
boston
lager
a
bit
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
but
i
can
drink
this
one
and
usually
if
i
can
drink
it
its
pretty
good
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
quick
finish
a
little
metallicy
served
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
hurricane
solid
not
must
have
i
was
excited
when
this
beer
first
came
out
because
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sammy
a
their
ability
to
brew
micro
beers
in
bulk
is
impressive
the
appearance
poured
with
a
nice
clear
copper
color
little
to
no
head
and
lace
with
this
bottle
the
smell
had
nice
hop
aroma
but
the
other
components
of
beer
are
missing
taste
was
a
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
good
medium
body
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
brew
that
can
be
sessioned
easily
i
think
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
from
sam
adams
could
be
way
better
and
i
did
overhype
it
to
myself
but
im
not
dissappointed
its
a
decent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
to
get
again
even
though
id
prefer
a
doggie
style
or
a
sierra
nevada
o
very
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
on
the
light
side
overall
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
but
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
hop
characteristics
or
complexity
na
zdravje
to
me
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
it
has
amazing
lace
and
head
that
just
stick
around
the
body
is
a
bronze
transparent
color
with
a
lot
of
small
bubbles
it
has
grainy
aroma
with
a
lot
of
hop
esters
the
flavor
is
cereal
like
with
the
hops
really
balancing
out
the
malt
the
only
negative
about
this
beer
at
all
is
that
is
does
have
a
metallic
aftertaste
it
is
a
very
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
overall
and
for
someone
like
me
whos
not
a
huge
hops
fan
this
is
okay
and
relatively
mild
the
look
of
this
beer
is
anice
rich
golden
with
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
isnt
too
overpowering
its
actually
a
lot
milder
than
i
was
expecting
the
taste
was
overall
too
tame
for
me
i
wish
this
pale
had
a
bit
more
bite
that
being
said
it
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
so
there
is
a
silver
lining
o
not
bad
pleasant
enough
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
for
a
basic
pale
ale
very
dissapointing
coming
off
as
more
a
pilsner
or
light
lager
with
its
hop
characteristics
clashing
with
the
graincorn
body
drinkable
but
lacking
for
the
style
o
not
a
pa
i
would
buyrecommend
i
will
stick
to
sa
boston
lager
or
noble
pils
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
bland
lots
of
bready
malts
and
fruity
malts
worth
trying
but
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
again
o
this
is
one
of
the
beers
from
sam
adams
that
ive
been
disappointed
by
each
time
ive
had
it
not
one
i
would
recommend
medium
bodied
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
earthy
with
some
pale
malt
and
a
slight
sweetness
toward
the
middle
a
very
runofthemill
english
pale
ale
flavor
not
at
all
a
bad
thing
it
finishes
earthy
with
a
bit
of
resin
like
hop
oil
that
gives
it
a
dry
aftertaste
you
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
it
probably
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
on
my
mind
as
i
headed
to
the
bar
dont
know
how
a
lot
of
people
give
this
almost
a
below
average
score
this
really
gives
all
the
english
pale
ales
some
big
competition
i
guess
because
with
so
many
extreme
styles
and
more
intricate
tastes
in
beers
i
guess
i
can
see
why
people
think
this
is
a
very
straight
forward
beer
but
its
definitely
not
bad
at
all
this
is
samuel
adams
most
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
even
with
the
very
straight
forward
taste
it
sure
is
solid
one
not
a
bad
pale
ale
its
got
a
good
drinkablity
and
a
mediam
body
to
it
its
got
a
nice
amount
of
hops
and
malts
on
the
nose
with
that
going
into
the
flavor
also
the
ale
has
a
pleasing
yellowish
golden
color
this
is
far
from
sams
best
but
its
still
a
solid
brew
it
is
a
slightly
sub
par
beer
but
i
am
not
entirely
sure
why
it
is
even
labeled
a
pale
ale
as
it
was
more
malt
forward
than
anything
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
any
beer
drinker
besides
someone
new
to
the
sport
o
it
is
from
a
big
time
company
so
the
color
and
mouthfeel
is
right
its
the
taste
that
sucks
wont
revisit
you
i
enjoy
sam
adams
stuff
but
not
this
a
nice
beer
wish
it
was
available
year
round
notes
recommended
an
overall
solid
goodtasting
dependable
brew
will
purchase
again
d
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
have
the
best
flavor
its
an
alright
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
pale
ales
out
there
d
very
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
with
slight
edge
to
hops
over
nice
biscuit
malt
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
can
be
consumed
all
night
of
with
most
foods
i
bet
this
one
is
dynamite
with
pizza
could
easily
drink
a
6
of
these
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
small
white
head
lovely
carbonation
aroma
of
floral
hops
biscuit

with
some
citrus
and
pear
notes
light
to
medium
slightly
crisp
body
flavor
of
biscuit

ripe
fruit
with
earthy
hops
come
through
in
the
long
dry
finish
decent
english
pale
poured
golden
orange
aroma
of
light
hops
some
citrus
notes
taste
is
lightly
hopped
with
some
malted
palate
is
light
to
med
body
with
moderate
carbonation
finish
is
light
hops
with
some
malt
for
balance
overall
an
average
simple
drinkable
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
it
is
very
different
from
what
i
picture
as
a
british
pale
ale
but
still
enjoyable
i
would
enjoy
it
more
with
some
crisper
hops
and
maybe
some
british
yeast
fruitiness
d
drinkability
is
low
what
began
as
a
beautiful
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
the
only
popping
characteristic
of
this
beer
is
the
bitterness
at
the
end
which
is
unacceptable
shame
i
did
finally
realize
there
was
a
pleasant
odor
halfway
through
so
it
saves
some
points
in
the
aroma
department
it
smelled
more
malty
to
me
than
hoppy
overall
its
good
if
they
had
it
on
tap
at
a
bar
id
have
one
of
mild
cereal
grains
faint
smokiness
and
very
mild
hops
citrus
taste
is
very
reserved
some
corn
tastes
upfront
but
moves
to
a
nicely
mellow
hops
and
mushy
banana
spicy
almost
cinnamon
finish
a
little
bland
and
cheap
tasting
but
certainly
a
good
first
decent
beer
experience
feel
is
average
more
body
than
most
mainstream
beers
more
flavor
and
more
to
experience
appearance
is
a
misty
golden
orange
with
a
fair
head
that
dissapates
but
not
totally
leaving
nill
lace
smell
of
light
sweet
caramel
malts
citrus
and
hops
taste
has
the
caramel
sweetness
with
light
body
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
a
big
bodied
complex
pale
ale
but
good
nonetheless
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
not
samuel
adams
best
offering
by
any
means
but
its
a
decent
english
pale
ale
the
aroma
and
flavor
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
more
robust
but
it
isnt
a
deal
breaker
its
worth
a
try
taste
is
very
much
a
light
pale
ale
very
light
more
flavor
than
bmc
but
clearly
the
next
level
a
better
introduction
to
beer
carbonation
seems
high
on
the
palate
compared
with
the
appearance
dry
typical
sam
adams
underhopping
even
for
an
english
style
pale
and
lemon
flavor
another
underwhelming
effort
from
sa
good
crisp
ale
here
carbonation
level
is
good
finishes
clean
this
has
great
flavor
excellent
balance
between
the
bittering
hops
and
a
smooth
sweet
finish
floral
notes
noted
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
apple
notes
this
surprised
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
is
as
accessible
of
a
pale
ale
as
one
can
get
a
spot
in
the
fridge
is
set
aside
for
this
one
from
now
on
sam
adams
pale
ale
is
probably
one
of
their
more
bitter
beers
but
it
still
has
that
delicious
full
body
taste
and
smooth
texture
that
sam
adams
is
know
for
i
should
mention
that
even
though
it
does
have
that
bitter
taste
the
bitterness
still
doesnt
compare
to
that
of
say
stones
ipa
i
would
call
this
a
good
bar
beer
to
have
1
or
2
of
db
nice
malt
and
hop
flavors
and
certainly
refreshing
sam
adams
makes
a
lot
of
solid
beers
with
nice
flavors
maybe
just
a
tad
too
hoppy
and
bitter
for
the
substance
of
this
one
i
was
never
a
fan
of
sam
adams
pale
ale
not
by
a
longshot
it
looks
good
and
all
with
nice
color
and
a
somewhat
lacey
head
but
it
falls
short
in
the
taste
department
its
not
very
flavorful
to
begin
with
and
what
little
flavor
is
present
is
quite
disagreeable
to
my
palate
its
just
bready
with
an
offensive
skunkiness
not
sure
why
they
still
make
this
this
will
probably
be
the
last
chance
i
give
this
beer
nothing
outstanding
here
pretty
average
pale
ale
average
drink
a
sort
of
bland
not
exciting
rendition
i
love
this
beer
it
pours
to
a
nice
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
th
e
smell
is
definetly
of
hops
and
malts
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
one
hell
of
a
drinkablility
i
really
recommend
you
try
this
pale
ale
you
will
truly
be
satisfied
light
coppery
golden
with
a
smooth
lumpy
white
head
sweet
toasty
malt
and
mild
herbal
english
hops
in
the
aroma
lightly
toasted
and
caramel
tasting
malt
with
some
minty
and
citric
hop
bittering
to
balance
light
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
style
pa
but
a
little
more
flavor
concentration
would
help
as
it
is
slightly
underwhelming
pours
a
hazy
tan
with
a
34
inch
head
medium
bodied
and
creamy
but
really
not
much
flavor
to
comment
on
in
fact
id
say
this
is
just
a
tiny
step
up
from
standard
mass
produced
beers
like
the
bud
lights
of
the
world
or
the
sam
adams
lights
for
that
matter
in
fact
id
choose
this
over
a
sa
light
granted
it
is
a
pale
ale
so
it
naturally
would
be
more
subtle
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
d
i
had
a
saranac
pale
ale
the
day
before
which
i
thought
was
better
this
pale
ale
was
decent
but
i
didnt
think
it
quite
measured
up
had
this
one
from
a
sams
summer
variety
case
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
nice
white
head
and
good
carbonation
seems
somewhat
on
the
lighter
side
as
most
craft
pale
ales
are
somewhat
darker
then
whats
offered
here
a
very
clean
smelling
beer
with
the
faintest
of
lemon
citrus
like
hops
you
really
need
to
struggle
to
get
much
of
any
aroma
tastes
sweet
with
a
touch
of
caramel
like
goodness
nothing
that
really
stands
out
mouthfeel
just
okay
this
beer
strikes
me
as
one
where
sam
adams
tried
to
keep
things
neutral
and
safe
its
not
bad
its
just
not
anything
close
to
revel
over
drinkability
pretty
good
could
have
a
few
more
of
these
if
they
were
available
not
too
flowery
for
me
nice
light
n
clean
flavor
enjoyable
on
a
warm
late
summer
night
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
flavor
but
overall
pretty
decent
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
looks
fantastic
and
generally
enjoyable
but
nothing
really
too
special
id
buy
it
again
for
a
good
session
beer
d
this
isnt
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
but
its
on
the
easier
side
to
drink
d
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
think
sam
adams
could
have
spent
a
bit
more
time
or
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
either
way
im
hesitant
to
drink
the
rest
overall
clearly
in
the
english
style
of
pale
ales
nothing
overthetop
here
just
subtle
understated
flavors
an
o
k
english
pale
easily
lost
in
the
crowd
pretty
drinkable
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
i
could
session
all
night
long
but
theres
a
whole
lot
of
better
choices
out
there
not
a
bad
2
bottles
in
the
summer
mix
pack
however
drinkability
an
above
average
pale
that
very
much
tastes
like
a
sam
adams
brew
nothing
i
would
get
excited
over
yet
high
quality
and
one
i
could
have
a
six
of
when
i
poured
it
into
my
pint
glass
it
has
a
1
finger
length
white
foamy
and
fizzy
head
to
it
on
top
of
a
golden
color
body
the
smell
is
of
malts
and
a
little
biscuit
the
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
to
it
it
is
a
very
smooth
ale
which
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
one
it
is
very
refreshing
after
a
long
day
at
work
pours
a
sparkly
clear
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
virtually
zero
retention
or
lacing
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
a
touch
of
toasted
caramel
and
floral
hops
also
some
minty
hops
in
there
taste
is
of
light
sweet
grains
and
grassy
spicy
hops
also
some
lemon
zest
in
the
hop
profile
well
balanced
this
one
has
a
little
butteriness
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
zingy
finish
i
found
it
to
be
a
well
balanced
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
makes
for
a
great
summertime
brew
d
drinkable
would
have
this
one
again
not
bad
on
a
hot
and
sticky
night
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
included
in
the
summer
variety
case
from
the
bbc
poured
into
a
frozen
clear
glass
mug
this
beer
produces
a
thick
white
foamy
head
about
two
inches
high
the
head
had
very
little
staying
power
and
faded
to
a
thin
white
covering
with
lace
of
little
clinging
power
color
is
a
rich
golden
amber
of
an
8
on
the
srm
chart
there
is
nothing
really
noteable
about
the
smell
light
malt
feels
good
on
my
tongue
just
the
right
amount
of
tickle
from
the
carbonation
taste
has
just
a
hint
of
hops
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
but
just
enough
to
add
zing
i
would
spend
my
cash
for
more
of
this
brew
drinkability
went
fine
with
a
meal
vegetarian
chili
and
cornbread
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
alone
its
way
too
carbonated
to
be
a
true
cask
english
pale
ale
but
despite
this
it
hits
a
lot
of
the
flavor
notes
well
and
its
an
enjoyable
beer
d
good
solid
pale
ale
offering
from
mr
koch
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
person
who
really
had
a
problem
with
it
it
might
also
be
hard
to
find
a
person
who
really
loves
it
either
though
d
easy
drinker
could
have
a
few
definitely
not
complex
but
a
good
summer
drink
nonetheless
quenching
t
initial
taste
slightly
bitter
with
hints
of
grass
in
the
flavor
not
sweet
the
spicing
is
on
the
pungent
side
a
touch
of
tinny
aftertaste
overall
the
flavor
is
a
creative
interpretation
of
a
pale
ale
flavor
but
tempered
to
reach
a
wide
clientele
notes
fits
in
well
with
sam
adams
line
up
its
nothing
special
but
its
a
decent
english
pale
ale
all
in
all
this
is
not
that
great
of
an
example
of
the
pale
ale
style
seems
to
me
like
most
of
the
sam
adams
beers
taste
the
same
i
think
their
best
stuff
is
just
the
boston
lager
drinkability
could
have
a
good
session
with
this
alone
not
any
overpowering
flavors
but
a
good
mix
of
them
to
want
more
d
very
drinkable
and
light
very
summer
seasonal
qualities
strong
carbonation
and
a
light
mouthfeel
make
this
one
a
pretty
easy
drinker
for
some
reason
i
think
it
smells
like
a
lager
should
smell
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
from
samuel
adams
cheers
not
a
leader
in
regards
to
the
style
but
a
decent
enjoyable
brew
this
came
as
part
of
a
sampler
pack
but
i
probably
would
only
buy
this
in
a
six
pack
if
my
options
were
limited
not
bad
but
not
great
either
md
super
drinkable
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
better
than
i
remember
d
versatile
refreshing
and
timeless
you
can
drink
this
beer
with
practically
anything
and
at
any
time
of
day
in
any
season
all
in
all
pretty
good
but
not
wowing
me
worth
a
try
in
the
mix
pack
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
final
notes
overall
not
impressed
with
this
beer
its
not
bad
just
a
bit
on
the
lightwatery
side
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
though
and
i
imagine
it
would
make
a
great
beer
to
serve
at
parties
i
seen
the
latitude
48
in
a
summer
sampler
and
just
had
to
buy
the
whole
freekin
thing
along
with
light
blackberry
wit
boston
lager
and
summer
ale
dammit
3
out
of
the
6
is
worth
it
plus
i
never
had
the
pale
ale
before
i
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
the
summer
but
all
in
all
its
just
an
o
k
pale
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
bright
golden
hue
thick
white
head
looks
delicious
taste
has
a
decent
balance
of
hops
and
malt
lite
body
and
no
lingering
aftertaste
at
least
there
was
no
cranberry
lambic
in
this
sampler
i
wanted
the
latitude
48
so
i
had
to
get
the
whole
summer
styles
box
oh
well
i
guess
ill
suck
it
up
and
drink
the
extraneous
bottles
tee
hee
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
with
over
a
finger
of
white
froth
on
top
the
nose
comprises
some
light
wheat
breadyish
yeast
and
hops
just
hops
deal
with
it
the
taste
holds
notes
of
everything
above
along
with
a
weak
hoppy
bitterness
and
some
grass
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
enough
pale
but
im
not
at
all
impressed
at
least
its
not
objectionable
d
this
was
very
unimpressive
only
a
half
step
up
from
a
macro
lager
it
was
more
bready
yeast
than
hops
making
it
seem
like
a
wheat
beer
rather
than
a
pale
ale
it
wasnt
very
clean
either
but
it
was
at
least
bland
enough
to
drink
quickly
and
easily
not
recommended
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
of
fresh
hops
are
a
bit
too
subdued
they
feature
more
prominently
on
the
palate
where
they
do
a
nice
job
of
balancing
the
toffeeish
malts
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
my
friends
and
i
have
discovered
that
it
goes
well
with
snacks
and
world
cup
matches
not
a
whole
lot
to
dislike
here
although
its
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
and
this
one
could
have
used
a
little
more
assertiveness
not
aggressiveness
just
needs
more
character
decent
enough
i
guess
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
a
barbeque
or
day
in
the
pool
appearance
and
smell
are
pretty
average
honestly
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
really
sort
of
unique
its
a
really
tart
beer
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
carbonation
fits
the
flavor
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
more
than
id
normally
like
but
its
really
fitting
for
this
one
you
could
drink
these
one
after
the
other
because
of
the
taste
and
feel
different
d
does
not
quite
make
the
grade
will
be
looking
for
other
brews
dgood

d
this
brew
redeemed
itself
in

end
it

beer
that
is

drinkable

it

this

around

it

poured

bottle

freshness
month
of
august
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
appears
a
very
light
orange
color
that
is
strikingly
clear
with
a
lively
amount
of
carbonation
rising
through
the
liquid
in
support
of
the
white
head
atop
the
brew
initially
the
head
was
more
than
2
fingers
strong
but
it
receeded
to
just
a
thin
coating
atop
and
lacing
sticks
in
plenty
of
patches
about
the
glass
aroma
has
herbal
hops
faint
grainy
malt
and
a
slight
mineral
touch
in
the
backend
the
most
prominent
aspect
of
the
aroma
is
the
herbal
hops
that
have
a
twing
of
citrus
aspect
about
them
as
the
beer
warms
taste
has
a
combination
upfront
of
herbal
and
citrus
hops
the
citrus
aspect
is
a
little
more
evident
than
indicated
in
the
aroma
the
malt
presents
itself
with
a
biscuity
flavor
across
a
thin
body
before
finishing
quite
crisp
with
the
herbal
slightly
citrus
hops
lingering
in
the
mouth
the
alcohol
is
mildly
evident
in
both
flavor
and
warming
factor
overall
it
is
a
decent
pale
quite
light
and
refreshing
it
would
be
easy
to
throw
a
few
of
these

i
wont

sam
has
aimed
for

middle
of
the
pa
spectrum
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
the
smell
has
a
slight
hop
and
malt
aromabut
it
is
pretty
faint
the
taste
has
a
hop
bite
as
well
as
a
nice

flavor
the
carbonation
makes
this
a
very
bubbly
beer
with
some
citrus
flavors
the
mf
is

its
a

watery
going
down

all
in

somewhat
watery
weak
and

im

sammy
their
offerings
are
usually
better
than
this

id
go
for
many
other
p
a
s
before
this
one
pours
a
clear
clean
golden
colour
with
foamy
white
head
and
active
carbonation
smells
of
faint
hoppiness
with
some
grainy
malts
as
well
flavour
is
similar
to
nose
a
little
hoppiness
with
malt
being
the
dominate
feature
overall
just
an
average
brew
nothing
fancy
or
impressive
about
it
at
all
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
their
offerings
but
i
havent
been
impressed
at
all
with
this
brewery
from
boston
i
will
however
try
some
more
of
their
beers
as
it
is
a
respected
brewery
a
very
nice
light
ale
perfect
for
when
you
want
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
good
flavor
but
not
something
huge
very
quaffable
and
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
theres
nothing
really
to
say
about
this
brew
its
drinkable
but
very
simpe
and
average
overall
id
like
to
see
the
hop
flavour
kicked
up
more
to
give
this
one
some
bite
can
i
recommend
this
one
no
can
i
say
avoid
it
no
try
it
if
you
want
but
dont
expect
much
in
return
this
is
an
average
pale
ale
and
much
better
than
the
boston
ale
it
has
a
decent
hppy
aroma
and
a
good
hop
and
malt
balance
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
leaves
a
crisp
bitterness
behind
definitely
not
nearly
as
smooth
as
a
lot
of
the
pale
ales
ive
had
before
but
still
good
smooth
drinkability
very
light
flavor
and
finish
for
those
hot
summer
days
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
light
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
fruity
quality
as
well
as
a
wonderful
english
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
great
this
is
what
i
like
about
the
english
style
pales
its
malty
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
the
hops
add
good
balance
and
it
attains
a
slight
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
beer
these
guys
brew
i
like
everything
about
it
exceedingly
drinkable
this
is
not
another
cookie
cutter
apa
full
of
grapefruit
and
pine
flavor
and
scent
this
is
much
closer
to
a
pilsner
in
bitterness
and
hops
used
this
beer
is
all
about
the
hops
satisfyingly
bitterness
and
very
well
dry
hopped
i
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
so
tasty
this
is
now
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
notes
this
is
a
good
beer
not
intense
but
has
a
bit
of
flavor
also
goes
well
with
bar
foods
chips
and
such
the
sulfer
kills
this
brew
gold
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
earthy
hoppy
smell
with
a
little
malty
sweetness
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
with
a
chewy
caramel
honeylike
sweetnes
to
back
it
up
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
nothing
get
bent
out
of
shape
about
overall
good
drinkability
and
worth
a
try
but
for
the
most
part
nothing
special
at
all
pours
with
a
bubbly
white
head
it
settles
then
reforms
now
and
again
the
body
is
a
beautiful
gold
the
nose
is
fruity
at
first
fresh
rasberries
then
a
honeyish
malt
aroma
good
taste
something
barely
estery
its
a
nice
element
although
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
any
particular
fruit
the
finish
is
only
mildly
bitter
and
that
will
add
a
point
to
the
drinkability
im
not
sharp
enough
to
pick
up
that
east
kent
goldngs
and
fuggles
were
the
hops
used
in
this
one
but
i
do
know
enough
to
taste
a
stab
at
the
classic
british
style
pale
when
i
taste
one
very
well
done
in
the
style
of
bass
way
back
in
the
day
subtle
and
wellcrafted
easy
drinking
but
not
exciting
if
i
want
an
american
pale
ill
reach
for
a
sierra
nevada
or
sweetwater
this
beer
isnt
doing
much
for
me
tonight
something
seems
a
little
off
with
the
flavor
or
maybe
this
beer
is
made
differently
than
the
apas
that
ive
had
anyway
the
color
of
the
beer
is
amber
with
a
large
semicreamy
head
smell
is
fairly
hoppy
but
has
a
generic
quality
to
it
flavor
is
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
less
hoppy
usually
the
apas
ive
had
have
more
bite
in
the
hops
department
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
strong
but
is
only
bothersome
in
the
finish
the
middle
of
the
sip
is
wellrounded
but
not
complex
and
full
enough
for
me
still
this
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
just
something
seems
a
little
off
here
i
wont
be
getting
this
in
the
future
ive
found
apas
i
find
much
more
tasty
this
ale
poured
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
very
modest
lightly
malty
with
a
touch
of
grain
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
a
slight
tanginess
and
medium
hoppiness
though
the
hop
bitterness
did
linger
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
medium
body
and
mediumlow
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
lingering
mild
bitterness
this
was
an
ok
plae
ale
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
overall
this
is
a
nice
pale

in

not

make
a

if
a

fresher
overall
impression
just
not
floating
my
boat
given
all
the
good
pale
ales
out
there
id
have
to
say
give
this
one
a
pass
im
on
the
edge
of
a
drain
pour
with
the
rest
of
my
glass
guess
i
was
in
the
mood
for
an
american
pale
ale
not
an
english
one
overall
a
good
solid
beer
a
nice
rounding
out
of
their
offerings
this
beer
poured
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
small
fizzy
pale
head
lots
of
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
little
lacing
it
was
almost
too
dark
for
a
pale
ale
imo
the
smell
was
very
floral
and
hoppy
i
could
almost
get
a
crispness
from
the
smell
of
this
beer
the
taste
seemed
a
little
too
onesided
to
me
the
hops
were
very
flavorful
but
not
really
bitter
at
all
the
malts
seemed
weak
but
ones
that
were
there
were
toasty
the
finish
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
very
nice
ale
nice
balance
between
full
bodied
and
smooth
intricate
taste
sort
of
unusually
pale
but
its
good
somewhat
reminds
me
of
spring
ale
but
a
little
more
bodied
hard
to
find
this
here
anymore
but
i
woulden
tpass
it
up
when
i
do
never
had
a
chance
to
try
it
but
im
sure
it
would
be
a
great
tap

poured
a
fairly
clear

with
a
lasting
creamy
head
about
one

the

was
very
good
the
aroma
was
not
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
it
was
mellow
floral
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
the
taste
was
also
not
what
i
anticipated
it
was
a
litle
laid
back
with
nice
hop
flavor
some
sweetness
caramel
and
decent
hop
bite
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
bit
sweet
with
some
hop
flavor
overall
i
found
it
to
be
milder
than
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
pale
ale
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
it
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
and
subtle
enough
to
go
with
a
variety
of
foods
this
pale
ale
is
dry
from
start
to
finish
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
sweetness
but
will
still
enjoy
it
overall
a
brew
i
found
to
be
only
marginally
above
the
average
drinkability
is
decent

id
have
liked
it
better

it

many
american

have
quite

more

than

but
not
this

the

was
pretty
strong

i
was

the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
pour
a

and

together
and
youd
probably
come
pretty

this
beer

it

me
at
the
right
time
after
a
hot
late

day
on

course

it
really
hit
the
spot
great
summer
session
brew
another
slightly
better
than
average
brew
from
sam
adams
this
one
poured
a
pale
golden
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
metallic
hops
and
slight
malts
taste
is
nice
not
too
sweet
bready
malts
up
front
witha
pleasant
hop
finish
not
too
hoppy
or
malty
maybe
im
crazy
but
i
swear
there
is
a
lemontart
component
in
here
not
my
type
of
pale
ale
it
feels
very
nice
easy
drinking
and
not
heavy
a
great
ale
when
a
person
wants
to
have
more
than
one
or
just
to
sit
back
on
a
warm
day
and
relax
a
good
summer
drinker
with
burgers
dogs
and
all
the
fixins
drinkability
is
again
about
average
there
are
difinately
worse
beers
out
there
but
there
is
also
many
better
ones
why
waste
the
time
the
smell
is
malty
and
slightly
sweetish
nice
a
caramel
front
gives
way
to
a
full
deep
malty
middle
with
some
caramel
and
a
little
chocolate
at
temperature
the
finish
is
dry
a
little
nutty
and
shows
some
buttery
toffee
overall
this
is
good
an
allaround
good
beer
that
tastes
much
as
it
looks
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
an
ample
2
finger
head
of
creamy
ivory
the
head
is
long
lasting
and
creates
very
good
lace
affect
the
nose
is
a
bit
light
but
gives
off
some
malt
a
trace
of
hops
and
a
small
sense
of
citrus
not
much
the
taste
leans
to
the
malt
side
and
starts
a
bit
sweet
the
hops
do
balance
the
malt
very
well
and
the
finish
is
dry
without
any
sense
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
moderately
full

light
sandpaper
misty

smell
is
faintly
bright
hop
thats
a
touch
on
the
citrusy
side
taste
is
mildly
smooth
has
an
immediate
little
bite
that
fades
quickly
and
lends
itself
mostly
bright
and
clean
with
a
a
dry
bittering
effect
thats
very
subtle
not
bad
at
all
it
trys
to
be
hoppy
but
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
but
very
tolerable
in
the
drinking
department
feel
is
bright
and
dryish
with
a
light
tipping
toward
a
medium
body
very
drinkable
and
mildly
smooth
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
was
better
then
it
looked
not
a
favorite
but
not
a
turndown
by
any
means
a
light
orange
in
color
with
a
faint
head
that
will
stick
in
patches
throughout
the
aroma
is
rather
dull
and
faint
light
hops
some
orange
peel
are
to
be
noted
the
taste
of
hops
and
somewhat
bitterness
up
front
some
light
roasted
malts
noted
with
banana
clove
in
the
background
this
was
more
on
the
bitter
than
pale
ale
side
somewhat
subtle
in
taste
and
flavor
finishes
creamy
and
dry
slightly
above
average
not
one
of
the
best
beers
produced
by
the
bbc
pours
thick
with
a
typical
samuel
adams
head
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
malt
accents
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
i
dont
know
if
this
is
what
a
pale
ale
is
supposed
to
taste
like
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
problem
i
have
with
samuel
adams
is
the
the
beers
all
taste
pretty
much
the
same
i
drank
this
out
of
a
sampler
and
after
a
few
they
all
tasted
the
same
this
brew
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
and
tons
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
the
aroma
was
very
hoppy
with
a
grassy
smell
also
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
not
totally
void
of
malts
after
that
wonderful
complex
aroma
i
was
expecting
a
wonderful
complex
taste
but
i
was
wrong
i
felt
the
taste
was
very
thin
the
little
taste
that
was
there
was
sort
of
flowery
and
grassy
there
just
wasnt
a
lot
going
on
with
this
brew
hard
to
pick
out
any
specific
flavors
maybe
because
there
wasnt
any
the
mouthfeel
was
okay
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
i
doubt
i
will
puchase
this
again
but
i
would
take
one
for
free
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
the
pint
pounder
a
crystal
clear
golden
amber
with
the
head
large
and
white
the
lace
adequate
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
crisp
and
fresh
lightly
floral
but
malt
dominates
start
is
lightly
sweet
the
top
light
in
feel
the
finish
strikingly
acidic
the
hops
pertinent
to
the
style
and
a
darn
good
session
beer
any
old
time
of
the
year
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
nice
lace
floral
hops
come
through
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
taste
up
front
with
oily
hops
dominating
the
finish
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
dark
golden
with
a
bigbubbled
white
head
that
settles
but
stays
slightly
it
looks
english
aroma
of
mild
english
hops
and
grainy
malt
that
sam
adams
aroma
flavors
present
are
grainy
malt
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
from
those
english
hops
very
crisp
and
dry
a
bit
bready
in
the
aftertaste
definitely
englishstyle
great
less
thinking
more
drinking
beer
tasty
but
not
complex
and
a
good
session
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
purchased
on
my
own
back
when
i
was
discovering
good
beer
i
give
it
an
honorable
mention
for
that
and
for
introducing
me
to
the
rest
of
the
sam
adams
line
which
led
me
to
try
other
craft
brews
bringing
me
into
the
world
of
diehard
beer
advocacy
great
memories
in
this
glass
i
like
englishstyle
ales
but
i
thought
this
one
was
only
slightly
better
than
average
a
nice
solid
copper
defined
the
appearance
in
the
glass
but
a
thin
head
with
little
to
no
retention
was
a
disappointment
i
sensed
a
faint
hoppy
floral
scent
after
a
little
swirling
the
beer
had
a
pretty
good
hop
bite
and
a
brief
lingering
bitterness
that
disappeared
a
little
too
early
but
i
did
like
the
mouthfeel
my
tongue
was
left
a
little
numb
between
sips
id
gladly
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
it
feels
good
going
down
but
overall
this
wasnt
too
much
of
a
standout
beer
for
me
a
pretty
safe
pale
ale
overall
but
one
can
find
better
like
i
said
a
good
bass
contender
maybe
whitbread
also
the
first
american
beer
with
more
to
follow
i
hope
ive
had
that
even
approaches
an
english
ale
profile
another
good
brew
from
boston
beer
floral
aroma
with
some
hops
in
there
too
nothing
special
as
far
as
pales
go
but
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
nice
hop
flavor
that
lets
you
know
you
are
still
drinking
an
english
pale
a
very
drinkable
tasty
brew
nothing
earthshattering
but
not
lacking
either
carbonation
is
just
right
aroma
is
a
bit
estery
and
alcoholic
with
soft
hop
character
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
goes
well
with
spicy
food
too
i
am
sick
of
people
bashing
boston
beer
co
come
on
admit
that
they
are
at
least
making
for
the
most
part
quality
beers
with
real
beer
character
i
just
finished
the
glass
i
think
ill
have
another
pours
out
a
clear
light
amber
colour
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
lotsa
lace
too
lightly
malty
and
fruity
in
the
nose
pretty
dry
and
crisp
with
a
definite
english
hop
bite
little
sweetness
to
be
found
a
bit
crackery
in
flavour
would
be
a
fine
pale
ale
to
wash
down
some
food
body
is
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
finishes
crisp
and
dry
as
stated
before
very
drinkable
overall
an
average
pale
ale
nothing
stands
out
to
make
this
version
remarkable
dont
confuse
sam
adams
pale
with
an
american
version
boston
beer
has
brewed
what
is
most
definitely
an
english
version
of
the
pale
for
our
taste
a
cobbled
london
street
in
spring
brought
to
us
by
a
leading
brewer
thanks
again
bbc
for
a
good
distribution
network
fair
prices
and
a
quality
brew
a
little
light
on
flavor
considering
the
great
aroma
and
autumn
color
not
sammys
best
offering
by
any
means
but
i
actually
like
this
more
than
their
flagship
beer
it
is
not
as
good
as
their
summer
or
winter
brews
though
as
i
have
developed
more
of
a
taste
for
pales
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
good
golden
and
smooth
with
a
perfect
amount
of
hops
this
beer
is
a
very
good
drinker
and
it
just
simply
goes
down
great
less
malt
that
in
the
boston
ale
and
more
hops
this
seems
to
make
it
a
pretty
typically
pale
the
hops
bite
first
but
only
a
little
bite
like
a
small
fuzzy
puppy
going
throught
its
teething
stage
hang
around
for
a
bit
and
then
it
finishes
with
a
smooth
malt
flavor
not
unpleasant
but
not
as
good
as
the
boston
ale
this
pale
ale
was
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
it
is
good
i
was
under
the
impression
it
was
an
apa
so
i
expected
a
nice
bitterness
and
a
stronger
aroma
it
has
a
nice
head
and
a
smooth
flavor
but
is
just
an
average
pale
ale
perhaps
ive
been
spoiled
by
my
recent
sierra
nevadas
and
burning
rivers
i
agree
with
some
of
the
previous
posts
an
average
beer
from
a
company
that
could
do
more
perhaps
the
bitterness
is
subdued
to
appeal
to
the
mass
market
orangecopper
body
topped
with
fairly
smooth
white
head
which
soon
settles
into
quarter
inch
cover
fresh
floral
aroma
with
some
fruit
lurking
in
the
background
fairly
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
but
hops
stick
around
much
longer
in
aftertaste
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
from
a
brewer
that
can
do
much
better
on
the
other
hand
my
opinion
of
this
beer
has
improved
since
its
introduction
when
i
thought
it
was
more
of
a
weak
golden
ale
has
it
been
reformulated
the
bottle
says
american
but
the
taste
says
english
this
is
a
good
beer
in
the
style
of
those
that
youd
sit

and
refreshing
if

memorable
again
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
friends
if
you
really
dont
want
to
be
thinking
about
the
beer
youre
drinking
not
great
quite
thin
in
the
end
and
it
had
quite
a
funky
sort
of
flavour
a
bit
oily
aswell
and
a
bit
soggy
tasting
not
their
best
okay
another
confessional
i
am
still
trying
to
sample
other
samuel
adams
but
for
the
pale
ale
my
local
brews
outshine
it
has
a
nice
color
and
smell
but
the
taste
is
nothing
that
really
moves
or
surprises
me
if
is
of
course
better
than
the
macros
but
still
far
removed
from
my
local
pales
i
realize
this
is
at
a
local
so
maybe
if
i
check
out
a
tap
version
to
what
i
am
comparing
it
to
it
may
do
better
the
boston
ale
is
the
bigger
brother
to
this
brew
for
sure
aroma
of
musty
malt
and
hops
light
gold
in
color
interesting
choice
of
east
kent
and
golding
hops
the
style
dictates
cascade
williamette
centennial
etc
slight
cardboard
oxidation
taste
in
the
finish
the
brew
lacks
real
character
next
to
the
other
high
power
pas
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
full
flavoured
pale
ale
leaning
towards
english
style
good
balance
to
make
for
a
beer
that
one
could
sit
down
and
have
a
few
and
not
be
overwhelmed
in
any
aspect
an
all
around
good
pale
ale
and
a
decent
stab
at
the
english
style
golden
in
color
w
a
slight
haze
the
head
is
thin
and
unimpressive
quintessential
floral
kent
goldings
notes
dominate
the
hop
nose
and
the
earthy
fuggles
note
is
secondary
malt
aroma
is
minimal
its
quite
similar
to
their
boston
ale
in
aroma
profile
having
a
slight
butterscotch
note
but
is
more
mild
comparatively
decent
toasty
malt
flavors
are
present
but
this
brew
is
a
bit
lacking
in
malt
character
overall
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
and
clean
with
the
characteristically
earthy
fuggles
flavor
dominating
it
finishes
clean
but
unexciting
i
wasnt
left
longing
for
another
although
a
decent
beer
the
lack
of
malt
complexity
deterred
from
its
potential
a
british
base
malt
such
as
maris

wouldve
been
a
better
malt
foundation
nice
and
wellcarbonated
pour
clear
pale

refreshing
mouth
feel
pretty
full
and
foamy
with
a
more

adequate
carbonation
theres
a
lack
of
hop
bite
nice
sweetness
but
still
enjoyable
very
nice
finish
that
is
slightly
dry
smooth
with
a
nice
crispness
overall
pretty
good
stuff
very
nice
copper
color
very
nice
belgian
lace
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
whole
time
the
taste
is
a
nice
light
ale
dry
finish
would
match
well
with
chicken
and
other
dishes
hops
are
floral
and
spicy
and
a
tad
metallic
not
fruity
average
finish
reminds
me
of
bass
the
boston
lager
tastes
more
like
an
american
pale
than
this
brew
average
mouthfeel
and
not
a
distinct
finish
9
something
of
a
letdown
mild
to
the
point
of
being
too
reserved
flavor
was
nice
and
clean
but
it
was
mellow
to
the
point
of
being
bland
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
pale
ales
but
this
one
ahhhh
pales
in
comparison
to
the
one
i
had
at
the
green
mill
restraunt
in
st
paul
this
is
definitely
on
the
dry
side
almost
spicey
a
bit
on
the
finish
crisp
and
pretty
easy
drinking
tastes
very
clean
and
crisp
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
only
slightly
above
average
in
my
book
this
is
an
average
pale
ale
the
hops
are
there
but
lend
mostly
bitterness
rather
than
flavor
this
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
there
are
other
pales
out
there
i
e
sierra
nevada
that
are
better
very
smooth
pale
ale
probably
one
of
the
most
mellow
ales
i
have
had
in
a
while
not
to
say
this
was
weak
just
smooth
and
tasty
i
could
many
these
at
one
sitting
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
give
to
inexperienced
beer
drinkers
not
intimidating
good
color
decent
head
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
aroma
clean
taste
good
flavor
well
balanced
a
good
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
aftertaste
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
tangerine
flavour
not
a
favourite
of
mine
but
still
enjoyable
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
entry
level
pale
i
didnt
notice
this
could
be
interesting
in
previous
tastings
not
near
a
london
pride
but
still
coming
on
its
own
tia
bit
watery
and
bland
like
other
ales
from
marstons
but
honest
and
surely
true
to
the
style
those
waters
at
burton
on
trent
english
hops
and
malts
are
very
well
balanced
and
i
could
have
this
again
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
english
bitter
better
than
many
bitters
that
come
to
the
usa
and
i
would
absolutely
love
to
have
this
out
of
a
cask

i
get
to

it
has
settled
into
a
warm
golden
colored
ale
with
a
good
half

head
the
first
sip
usually
a
big
sip
doesnt
usually
reveal
too
many
of
the
beers
bitter
or
more
fruity
notes
but
about
half
way
down
wow
suddenly
the
beer
comes
alive
and
reasserts
itself
at
the
top
of
the
drinkability
board
it
has
a
really
smooth
finish
that
makes
for
easy
drinking
and
fast
drinking
if
your
not
careful
or
you
are
careful
i
usually
find
3
or
4
pints
of
this
ale
starts
the
night
off
splendidly
as
i
say
if
this
beer
is
done
right
and
looked
after
and
poured
well
it
is
the
best
but
a
bad
pedigree
that
hasnt
been
stored
right
or
is
poured
badly
or
even
chilled
ruins
the
flavors
of
this
excellent
english
ale
there
is
no
real
smell
as
i
find
slight
and
only
very
slight
fruity
notes
but
mostly
a
light
hoppy
style
of
aroma
this
is
a
truly
remarkable
beer
i
find
this
beer
is
at
its
best
when
served
from
an
old
fashioned
pump
in
an
english
pub
the
canned
variety
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
although
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
4
pack
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
o
an
average
beer
very
drinkable
tasty
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
solid
but
not
exceptional
overall
pretty
good
overall
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
english
bitter
crossed
with
and
english
pale
ale
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
o

drinker
for
the

overall
this
is
not

beer
its
not
a
great
beer
either
but
its
nice
given
a
choice
of
some
other
british
pub
style
beers
and
this
i
would
opt
for
something
else
o
this
aspect
i
gave
a
5
due
to
style
concerns
this
beer
embodies
in
every
way
why
i
love
getting
down
with
a
good
basic
english
ale
every
once
in
a
while
they
are
often
balanced
perfectly
taste
soft
and
subtle
and
go
with
just
about
any
food
you
might
be
eating
at
the
time
its
a
great
style
to
have
when
you
just
want
to
drink
a
good
solid
beer
and
not
shell
out
a
ton
of
money
for
something
thats
hopped
to

a

one
that
i
will
return
to
from
time
to
time
o
my
only
other
offering
from
this
brewery
was
disappointing
and
i
walked
by
this
one
for
some
time
before
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
try
glad
i
did
i
relatively
enjoyed
this
brew
although
i
would
likely
not
seek
it
out
again
given
the
plethora
of
good
brews
available
for
the
style
overall
a
pleasant

there
are
also
some

i
am
picking
up
medium
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
low
carbonation
level
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
pale
ale
that
claims
to
be
the
official
ale
of
england
however
this
is
not
as
good
as
other
english
beers
in
my
opinion
m
the
sensation
is
balanced
but
again
turns
a
little
more
into
the
bitterness
sweetness
is
present
at
the
beginning
turning
fast
into
bittersweetness
and
then
into
bitterness
for
a
bitter
long
ending
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
not
bad
beer
let
the
bottle
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
nice
offwhite
textured
foamy
frothy
fluffy
head
that
slowly
settled
down
and
a
little

color
is
a
clear
honey
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
subdued
and
is
of
malt
yeast
hops
caramel
and
fresh
bread
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
and
has
good
balance
between
bitter
sweet
and
tang
body
is
great
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
tapers
from
sweet
to
bitter
session
beer
overall
in
my
mind
this
beer
is
not
particularly
tostyle
compared
to
other
english
pales
ive
had
but
on
its
own
it
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
id
definitely
have
this
again
clear
and
clean
pour
from
the
can
but
head
dissipated
quickly
aromas
were
golden
syrup
malt
and
bread
which
was
very
nice
my
wife
has
just
been
drinking
this
on
tap
in
the
uk
and
says
its
not
as
robust
as
in
the
pub
still
flavours
are
nice
and
malty
sweet
with
some
late
bitterness
which
should
prevent
cloying
but
found
it
a
bit
out
of
balance
and
weakened
the
drinkability
score
for
me
carbonation
was
almost
nonexistent
and
it
is
a
little
watery
i
prefer
john
smiths
which
is
very
similar
but
more
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
exciting
overall
very
tasteful
pale
ale
but
at
the
same
time
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
while
theres
the
problem
that
theres
no
strong
features
to
it
i
think
its
almost
a
staple
for
english
ales
definitely
worth
a
try
o
nothing
special
run
of
the
mill
english
ale
taste
not
much
going
on
here
at
all
a
bit
of
wood
faint
and
subdued
citrus
and
a
mineral
finish
not
much
malt
character
to
speak
of
very
dry
and
quite
refreshing
overall
this
was
a
good
drink
easy
and
refreshing
one
more
to
my
plus
list
the
mouthfeel
seemed
typical
for
the
style
a
bit
undercarbonated
medium
to
light
bodied
d
a
solid
downright
archetypal
example
of
the
english
pale
ale
but
only
really
distinguished
by
its
exceptional
mouthfeel
it
may
be
the
most
sessionable
epa
ive
had
yet
very
easy
to
go
beer
a
good
start
for
getting
in
this
style
as
well
as
no
offensive
to
revisit
d
a
generally
well
made
and
drinkable
english
pale
ale
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
but
its
still
just
a
standard
english
bitter
its
a
good
beer
to
wet
your
whistle
with
its
light
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
not
overly
watered
down
but
not
thick
either
the
average
drinker
would
probably
enjoy
this
quite
a
bit
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
would
get
bored
drinking
too
many
of
these
though
the
color
is
a
minimal
hazy
yellow
with
not
much
head
would
have
liked
to
try
this
one
on
tap
because
it
sounds
much
better
than
way
must
have
had
this
at
a
pivotal
moment
a
lot
of
things
were
clicking
not
only
did
the
flavor
wow
me
a
good
bit
it
rolled
through
the
palate
velvety
smooth
reminding
me
of
the
first
time
i
had
a
cask
ale
the
carbonation
had
yet
or
failed
to
take
hold
but
it
was
alien
and
lovely
i
see
on
their
website
that
they
distribute
this
to
the
us
where
oh
state
line
of
course
o
a
very
sessionable
drop
that
is
quite
balanced
dr
a
wonderful
example
of
cream
done
right
kind
of
a
kilkenny
meets
belhaven
but
sadly
lacking
in
the
body
id
recommend
it
to
fellow
brewers
just
to
see
how
creamy
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
at
glasgow
prices
lacks
the
usual
bitterness
of
pale
ales
which
is
actually
quite
nice
in
this
case
d
a
classic
of
english
brewing
im
delighted
to
see
it
back
good
now
but
begs
to
be
on
cask
almost
seems
to
drink
bigger
than
4
5
i
need
to
knock
this
category
a
couple
points
as
the
beer
seems
filling
and
burpy
i
have
no
doubt
this
would
be
easierdrinking
off
a
cask
and
would
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
do
so
d
its
okay
not
any
better
than
any
other
widely
available
epa
boddingtons
abbot
etc
d
compared
to
other
similar
beers
this
one
translates
well
in
the
bottle
nothing
amazing
good
for
what
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
so
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
feels
fine
in
the
mouth
not
thick
but
you
know
its
there
an
ok
ale
but
rather
bland
i
wont
be
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
get
a
resinsyrup
type
aftertaste
meaning
id
probably
never
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
it
does
feel
a
bit
heavy
overall
but
ill
definitely
try
it
again
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
definitely
a
session
beer
drinakabilty
is
above
average
i
could
have
some
more
but
possibly
would
levitate
more
to
marstons
ipa
cheers
wow
this
is
certainly
an
excellent
example
of
the
english
pale
ale
style
i
like
it
more
so
than
a
few
other
examples
ive
had
i
would
highly
recommend
it
o
easy
to
drink
but
boring
after
a
while
d
overall
a
decent
epa
not
bad
at
all
d
a
classic
british
session
beer
not
complex
or
bold
but
very
very
drinkable
interestingly
i
found
some
differences
between
this
swedish
can
version
and
the
english
bottle
version
to
the
english
bottles
advantage
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
and
as
per
usual
with
english
bitters
i
could
enjoy
this
all
night
with
or
without
food
to
accompany
it
clean
refreshing
yet
still
does
retain
some
smooth
richness
highly
recommended
fairly
drinkable
if
you
want
an
average
bitter
but
overall
nothing
remarkable
here
no
need
to
search
out
or
pay
the
inflated
export
price
almost
feels
a
bit
undercarbonated
to
be
honest
which
makes
it
feel
slightly
watery
but
its
not
too
bad
a
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
english
pale
ale
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
what
bass
ale
used
to
taste
like
drinkability
is
perfect
this
is
the
ideal
session
beer
imho
drink
a
nice
moderately
flavorful
brew
that
would
be
decent
for
a
session
it
isnt
overpowering
just
a
nice
all
around
beer
thanks
to
sebastian
for
the
bottle
overall
decent
the
fruit
was
a
nice
surprise
and
it
was
easy
to
drink
there
are
much
better
out
there
but
this
isnt
bad
feels
quite
creamy
and
smooth
at
first
but
the
hops
give
it
quite
a
dry
character
towards
the
end
very
nice
very
good
mouthfeel
carbonated
just
enough
so
it
the
end
is
dry
but
not
so
much
that
it
becomes
a
fizzy
soda
very
drinkable
overall
nothing
amazing
but
a
solid
english
ale
overall
will
have
to
try
this
on
cask
since
ive
previously
been
quite
put
off
by
pedigree
m
d
decent
feel
simple
and
straightforward
low
alcohol
beer
a
nice
choice
for
a
rainy
summer
day
id
drink
this
again
especially
on
draft
d
very
dry
and
toasty
with
little
malt
sweetness
and
fairly
weak
yeast
character
the
hops
are
strong
in
terms
of
both
flavor
and
bitterness
with
a
chalky
mineral
twang
not
bad
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
yeast
fruit
to
cut
the
harshness
of
the
hops
from
the
500
ml
bottle
marked
oahk0454
sampled
on
july
16
2010
it
pours
a
handsome
looking
ambercopper
with
about
threequarters
of
an
inch
of
beige
silky
head
that
lasts
for
quite
some
time
the
aroma
has
a
pleasing
balance
of
creamy
caramel
malts
and
english
hops
the
hops
are
steeped
in
bread
and
biscuit
for
afters
the
mouthfeel
falls
in
the
medium
territory
but
is
has
a
smooth
creaminess
to
it
definitly
an
english
style
bitter
in
the
classic
sense
with
a
sharp
but
easy
to
drink
finish
ah
yes
a
nice
brew
according
to
its
bottle
cap
marstons
claims
to
be
the
official
ale
of
england
while
i
think
the
country
may
be
selling
itself
a
bit
short
on
that
i
do
appreciate
that
this
bitter
is
still
brewed
according
to
traditional
methods
with
locally
grown
ingredients
and
that
it
embodies
the
virtues
of
balance
and
sessionability
that
define
the
english
brewing
tradition
d
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
pale
ale
very
unimpressed
with
this
one
and
am
glad
i
only
ordered
a
small
glass
at
churchkey
its
not
a
phenomenal
beer
but
its
solid
enough
theres
nothing
off
or
offensive
about
it
but
nor
is
there
anything
unique
or
exciting
about
it
it
is
like
drinking
water
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
but
the
flavor
is
kind
of
weak
it
has
more
character
than
most
form
this
category
but
it
still
could
have
more
well
the
official
beer
of
the
english
cricket
team
lives
up
to
the
hype
ive
been
hearing
about
for
years
its
nice
to
know
that
a
beer
that
is
still
made
traditionally
can
be
not
only
a
well
loved
beer
but
can
be
a
marketing
success
d
an
excellent
quaffing
beer
which
i
personally
prefer
in
bottle
form
rather
than
cask
a
well
crafted
beer
from
marstons
brewery
an
aboveaverage
epa
certainly
one
to
knock
back
in
a
pub
nose
isnt
fantastic
but
the
taste
is
wonderfully
smooth
500ml
bottle
purchased
at
the
wellington
bradley
lcbo
pours
a
light
amber
with
one
finger
of
white
head
and
speckled
lacing
on
the
shaker
bubbly
carbonation
in
the
body
smell
and
taste
are
sulphur
mineral
water
sweet
fruitiness
a
bit
floral
caramel
malt
triscuit
crackers
and
a
leafy
english
hop
bitterness
somewhat
citric
mouthfeel
is
silky
soft
medium
great
bite
on
the
palate
a
little
spicy
dry
and
fleeting
finish
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
british
institution
awesome
example
of
an
epa
and
surprisingly
good
for
such
a
widely
distributed
beer
worth
my
three
dollars
in
the
end
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
drinkability
uninspiring
quite
a
light
drink
overall
a
decent
brew
and
one
that
i
thought
i
appreciated
more
by
reviewing
it
if
i
was
drinking
this
straight
from
the
bottle
in
another
setting
i
wouldnt
think
this
beer
was
above
average
by
any
means
it
could
definitely
be
more
flavourful
but
whats
there
makes
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
notes
decent
beer
that
is
a
pretty
good
session
beer
the
flavors
are
a
little
light
and
watered
down
good
for
a
everyday
beer
but
not
outstanding
d
highly
drinkable
its
easy
going
down
but
it
just
lacks
character
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
pale
ale
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
sweet
some
malts
and
hops
taste
is
good
hops
malts
maybe
some
fruit
a
bit
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
worth
trying
the
malt
taste
is
mild
but
has
a
good
herbal
hop
balance
the
back
half
has
some
mineral
taste
that
finishes
dry
with
medium
bitterness
the
aftertaste
might
be
the
most
interesting
with
light
citrus
then
slight
diactyl
fading
to
cotten
candy
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
true
to
style
drinkability
a
well
respected
british
bitter
which
provides
well
rounded
flavours
with
a
dangerously
drinkable
quality
drinkable
enough
this
but
leans
too
heavily
on
the
bland
english
hoppiness
suitable
for
downing
but
not
for
downing
street
if
that
makes
sense
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
it
has
sessionable
plastered
all
over
it
a
bit
thin
on
mouthfeel
but
that
probably
helps
drinkability
you
would
struggle
to
fill
up
on
this
beer
which
is
good
because
i
could
pass
hours
drinking
this
maple
bronze
with
a
soft
ivory
head
that
is
small
but
retains
well
and
has
an
even
smooth
texture
mild
slightly
fruity
nose
of
unripe
bananas
oak
honey
and
wheat
bran
with
a
hint
of
white
wine
solid
and
welldeveloped
flavor
fruity
and
light
yet
earthy
and
deep
lighter
notes
of
honey
lavender
lemon
lime
and
champagne
interplay
with
shadows
of
oak
pine
maple
syrup
and
sourdough
and
rye
breads
the
carbonation
is
just
about
spoton
soft
yet
lively
and
buoyant
not
terrifically
dry
but
still
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
very
good
ill
have
to
give
it
ago
on
cask
next
time
i
see
it
not
bad
not
great
overall
corny
aroma
with
a
hint
of
diacetyl
but
caramel
and
malt
dominate
there
are
light
apple
esters
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
lighter
crystal
malts
the
body
is
very
thin
and
the
finish
is
watery
served
with
a
minimal
head
at
cellar
temperatures
this
is
in
the
uk
after
all
and
poured
a
lovely
deep
gold
with
crystal
clarity
drinkability
good
pricequality
ratio
good
representation
of
the
style
i
myself
am
not
an
enthusiast
of
epas
but
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
little
potential
for
aging
easy
to
drink
and
complex
enough
to
make
you
want
to
drink
more
md
in
general
the
overall
profile
is
way
less
sulphurous
less
smooth
and
slightly
more
bitter
than
the
cask
version
as
regards
any
woodiness
endowed
by
the
union
system
consisting
of
lots
of
aligned
oak
barrels
its
very
understated
but
quite
rightly
supposedly
so
i
always
have
problems
with
the
fizz
level
of
marstons
bottled
beers
but
this
slightly
spritzy
bottle
doesnt
show
much
trace
of
bad
pasteurisation
or
skunkiness
hence
a
plus
for
the
drinkability
while
this
new
5
bottle
version
proves
to
be
an
easydrinking
one
without
any
hint
of
alc
at
all
to
me
id
still
choose
the
cask
version
when
i
fancy
a
pint
of
traditional
oakaged
pale
ale
and
when
my
preferred
wadworth
6x
is
unavailable
from
my
local
pubs
served
on
gravity
straight
from
the
wooden
cask
overall
a
decent
ale
just
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
moutfheel
is
medium
oh
it
doesnt
matter
this
wasnt
a
horrible
beer
but
it
wasnt
anything
i
would
recommend
or
try
again
taste
was
quite
bitter
with
nice
combination
of
hops
and
maltiness
it
was
interesting
that
i
had
tasted
macs
gold
all
malt
lager
beforehand
but
there
was
much
more
maltiness
to
this
brew
overall
a
solid
bitter
from
the
bottle
overall
very
pleasent
good
start
definitely
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
dull
orange
colour
big
fluffy
white

very

pretty
average
pale
ale
decent
but
nothing
special
about
it
this
is
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
pretty
drinkable
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
just
a
tad
id
be
more
enthused
to
drink
more
definitely
one
of
marstons
better
beers
quite
a
malty
taste
but
quite
flavoursome
recommended
to
any
ale
fans
out
there
overall
very
good
stuff
much
better
than
i
initially
expected
dont
know
why
i
came
into
it
with
low
expectations
but
it
totally
showed
me
up
in
every
aspect
would
buy
again
overall
i
just
might
not
be
the
best
qualified
to
review
english
bitters
but
this
doesnt
really
compete
with
some
of
the
other
examples
that
ive
had
still
not
too
bad
i
really
have
to
save
up
my
money
to
go
to
england
to
experience
this
oncask
wonderful
sessionability
with
subtle
yet
complex
aroma
and
flavors
you
could
do
worse
than
marstons
pedigree
for
sure
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
remarkable
keep
clicking
there
are
lots
of
epas
out
there
that
can
run
laps
around
this
one
glad
i
tried
one
but
given
the
price
of
beer
these
days
my
money
will
be
spent
elsewhere
there
is
no
knockout
punch
here
but
this
is
a
solid
allrounder
very
much
a
superior
session
beer
im
sure
this
wont
be
my
last
this
one
didnt
impress
too
much
flavour
profile
just
didnt
work
for
me
well
balanced
and
drinkable
tastes
of
pale
malts
good
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
skunk
d
ok
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
on
tap
at
the
village
idiot
arrived
at
the
table
with
a
copper
colour
and
a
small
offwhite
creamy
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
floral
hops
in
the
taste
the
malt
seems
to
come
through
as
lightly
fruity
flavours
with
notes
of
honey
and
lightly
floral
hops
theres
hardly
any
bitterness
and
the
finish
is
a
touch
bland
very
smooth
body
with
minimal
carbonation
the
whole
thing
is
subdued
enough
to
be
suitable
for
sessioning
but
id
really
be
looking
for
something
a
bit
better
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
one
i
wouldnt
mind
quaffing
a
litre
of
every
so
often
cheers
this
is
a
traditional
english
bitter
that
i
have
drunk
for
decades
albeit
normally
on
draft
dark
amber
with
lively
head
malty
caramel
nose
while
on
the
palate
there
is
nuttiness
and
a
touch
of
caramel
reasonable
body
at
this
alcohol
level
restrained
hop
its
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
even
if
it
doesnt
set
the
world
on
fire
d
smooth
enough
to
consume
a
few
before
calling
it
quits
apple
aroma
disappeared
very
quickly
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
and
very
fine
bubbles
coming
up
through
the
glass
some
lace
initial
salty
applefruit
flavor
followed
by
a
mellow
spicy
hop
flavor
and
slight
bitterness
aftertaste
a
nice
blend
of
fruit
spicy
hops
bitterness
mediumlight
carbonation
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
subtle
yet
complex
overall
very
interesting
and
well
balanced
beer
great
bitterness
presence
a
must
have
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
redamber
color
with
little
to
no
head
after
it
has
settled
there
is
a
queer
sentiment
that
settles
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
strong
of
candied
fruits
almost
like
a
good
quadrupel
with
heaps
of
sugar
the
taste
has
a
resemblance
to
apple
juice
with
the
same
carbonation
as
cider
its
very
malty
with
not
a
hint
of
bitterness
there
is
a
good
aftertaste
which
lingers
for
a
while
but
better
than
that
is
the
drinkabilitythis
beer
goes
down
easy
and
begs
for
another
sip
d
a
pretty
decent
tasty
epa
at
4
5
not
the
most
interesting
around
just
nice
well
balanced
i
wonder
if
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
i
bet
that
a
nitrogen
charge
would
really
aerate
this
beer
and
bring
out
the
flavor
the
taste
was
off
watereddown
bagged
tea
distant
smacks
of
honey
and
a
copper
penny
overall
it
was
like
iced
tea
mixed
half
and
half
with
tepid
creek
water
not
at
all
good
locals
told
me
it
can
be
hit
and
miss
on
tap
not
a
good
sign
i
first
had
a
marstons
pedigree
when
i
was
over
in
england
a
few
years
back
i
remember
it
being
sharp
to
the
tongue
this
bottled
version
is
much
smoother
and
sweeter
than
i
recall
it
being
theres
a
rich
maltiness
within
the
brown
body
that
overrides
any
hoppy
flavor
good
head
on
the
pour
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
the
sweetness
d
not
too
flashy
overall
its
ok
i
could
drink
this
again
a
nice
mild
and
sweet
malty
intro
with
notes
of
oak
and
vanilla
that
eventually
fade
to
a
nice
bitter
finish
nicely
balanced
medium
body
with
good
flavor
this
ale
goes
down
effortlessly
give
it
a
go
overall
i
was
very
surprised
with
the
fullness
of
this
beer
ill
definitaley
buy
again
the
beer
i
reviewed
was
purchased
in
a
weatherspoons
pub
in
birmingham
england
on
13th
jan
2007
drinkability
isnt
that
great
the
aroma
is
kind
of
unpleasant
and
the
taste
is
fairly
similar
d
decent
sessionable
epa
fairly
drinkable
if
you
like
bitterness
but
overall
nothing
remarkable
here
a
typical
english
pale
ale
but
seems
to
become
stale
very
quickly
not
one
ill
pick
up
again
not
something
id
pick
up
again
basically
ranks
in
with
most
macros
for
me
50
cl
bottle
it
pours
a
little
almost
inexistent
head
with
a
copper
orange
colour
smell
of
limestone
floral
hops
and
cookies
or
biscuit
mouth
of
fruits
limestone
nuts
and
some
butter
a
bit

too

sweetness
this
beer
pour
a
golden
copper
with
some
reddish
undertones
slight
head
and
lacing
and
some
visible
carbonation
the
nose
has
some
fruity
notes
as
well
as
a
hop
presence
the
taste
has
almost
spicy
elements
with
some
bitter
hops
lingering
around
and
a
slight
woody
finish
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
crisp
and
dry
with
noticable
carbonation
somewhat
light
bodied
but
i
think
that
actually
works
in
the
beers
favour
overall
i
like
this
ale
quite
a
bit
its
flavourful
but
at
the
same
time
not
too
heavy
a
good
option
when
looking
for
something
refreshing
and
tasty
and
pretty
easy
to
down
a
few
extremely
drinkable
a
very
well
done
session
beer
pours
a
hazy
coperred
color
with
suspended
yeat
minimal
head
and
okay
lacing
aroma
of
hops
and
dark
fruits
while
initial
flavor
was
okay
the
finish
seemed
very
metallic
at
first
however
as
beer
warmed
the
flavor
became
more
fruity
and
subtle
and
finish
smoother
actually
left
a
warming
sensation
which
is
uncommon
for
a
beer
with
this
low
abv
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
a
perfectly
ok
average
english
beer
average
thats
what
it
is
and
for
me
thats
not
good
enough
im
sure
i
remember
it
as
memorable
if
that
makes
sense
nice
to
try
this
old
world
classic
on
tap
drop
off
laundry
in
nyc
pours
dark
orangy
amber
semi
cloudy
with
a
long
lasting
light
tan
head
and
leaving
pleanty
of
lacing
mildly
malty
nose
this
is
a
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
pleasant
tasty
and
easy
drinking
brit
all
the
way
ale
low
alcohol
balanced
a
fine
sessioner
if
you
see
it
on
tap
its
well
worth
a
try
the
beer
poured
gold
and
a
bit
amber
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
light
floral
hop
finish
the
feel
was
light
and
dry
this
beer
was
ok
i
didnt
find
anything
that
would
steer
me
away
from
it
but
nothing
that
would
steer
me
back
man
id
like
to
try
this
on
cask
overall
good
stuff
marstons
pedigree
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
from
a
500ml
brown
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
mild
and
i
really
cant
pick
much
out
from
it
tastes
like
a
fairly
light
but
very
well
balanced
english
pale
ale
the
bottle
indicates
that
it
was
brewed
in
oak
casks
i
may
be
picking
up
some
flavor
from
the
oak
but
its
not
particularly
strong
overall
not
bad
worth
a
try
nothing
to
get
to
excited
about
though
the
first
taste
seems
to
confirm
this
roasted
nutty
caramel
malt
character
predominates
but
theres
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
this
one
interesting
soft
on
the
tongue
dry
in
the
throat
i
thought
this
one
might
be
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
but
its
not
too
bad
this
is
a
very
british
beer
and
a
fairly
well
executed
one
the
lower
abv
keeps
it
pretty
quaffable
i
can
see
downing
a
few
pints
of
these
in
a
london
pub
next
time
i
go
being
labelled
exceptional
premium
ale
sounds
a
bit
odd
however
an
expectional
brew
this
definitely
is
a
typical
burton
ale
not
very
rich
not
very
fruity
not
very
sweet
not
very
dry
however
all
nots
in
a
perfect
and
very
soft
harmony
if
bass
is
one
of
the
best
large
quantity
ales
this
one
does
even
better
pours
a
medium
goldencopper
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quite
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
but
maintains
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
smells
of
caramel
and
sweet
maltiness
with
fruits
and
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
are
dominated
by
butter
and
caramels
with
a
hoppy
finish
and
some
spices
in
the
mix
as
well
mouthfeel
is
watery
but
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
but
the
beer
is
unimpressive
overall
quite
average
overall
not
exactly
unpleasant
but
nothing
to
particularly
recommend
it
either
very
refreshing
and
great
for
sipping
with
sausage
and
chips
best
i
can
say
is
that
its
nice
competently
done
but
not
remarkable
a
nice
enough
brew
that
has
the
potential
to
be
great
when
its
fresh
i
wish
i
could
decipher
the
dating
system
on
the
back
label
and
save
my
3
for
a
nonelderly
bottle
ill
have
to
bug
a
friend
for
a
bottle
or
can
next
time
someone
hops
across
the
pond
a
pleasing
brownish
copper
colour
soilid
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
a
very
assertive
hoppy
flavor
as
one
would
expect
not
much
else
going
on
though
aside
from
a
slight
undercurrent
of
bread
without
much
of
an
interesting
flavor
contribution
from
the
malt
or
yeast
solid
but
i
was
expecting
more
notes
not
bad
nothing
really
impressive
here
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
head
there
are
suspended
yeast
floaties
present
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
and
fruity
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
along
with
bitter
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
weak
and
watery
malt
flavor
that
borders
on
an
ice
tea
taste
it
is
light
and
bitter
with
a
slight
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
there
is
no
real
substance
to
this
beer
this
is
a
big
let
down
i
was
expecting
something
much
better
with
a
little
more
malt
flavor
a
pleasure
to
finally
try
this
burton
classicpours
a
rich
golden
with
a
large
two
finger
white
head
settling
into
a
creamy
mass
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
behind
whoo
this
is
brewed
in
oak
casks
and
it
shows
in
the
aroma
very
woody
with
a
touch
of
sulpherflavors
are
very
dry
firm
biscuity
malt
backbone
followed
by
just
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
my
guess
fugglesnow
this
is
a
sessionable
ale
dry
enough
to
make
the
mouth
want
more
not
earth
shattering
but
glad
i
gotta
a
chance
to
try
it
for
sure
clear
amber
offwhite
head
that
reduced
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
malty
aroma
was
a
combination
of
graininess
and
light
caramel
a
bit
of
fruitiness
was
also
present
and
hops
appeared
as
it
warmed
a
bit
the
flavour
was
very
much
like
the
aroma
nicely
balanced
with
a
drying
bitterness
at
the
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
mild
buttery
texture
this
could
definitely
work
as
a
session
beer
this
pale
ale
could
become
one
of
my
regulars
mourhfeel
moderate
a
nice
pint
to
sit
around
with
a
decent
reliable
beer
this
a
slightly
nutty
flavour
the
hops
are
there
but
only
on
the
background
its
a
darkish
colour
the
amount
of
foam
you
get
is
variable
but
it
doesnt
really
last
though
it
will
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
at
4
5
it
really
ought
to
be
a
little
strong
for
a
session
beer
but
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
reccommended
seems
a
bit
thick
for
a
bitter
but
ultimately
easy
to
drink
a
decent
session
beer
of
remaining
foam
balanced
earthy
and
woody
smell
some
sourness
also
but
nothing
unpleasant
taste
is
smooth
and
very
british
pale
ale
type
taste
a
smooth
soft
slightly
malty
taste
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
real
this
thing
is
versatile
with
food
but
it
makes
me
want
cheese
and
breadmustard
and
branstons
pickle
maybe
some
apples
thrown
in
too
quite
smooth
and
quaffable
i
bet
this
one
is
a
lot
better
ontap
or
cask
a
nice
still
brewed
in
wood
cap
for
my
collection
pedigree
is
caramel
coloured
or
rusty
brown
topped
with
a
largebubble
head
that
goes
down
rather
rapidly
but
never
disappears
entirely
on
the
second
pour
the
head
is
much
more
creamy
small
bubbled
and
more
consistent
the
lacing
leaves
moderate
amounts
on
the
glass
but
when
the
beer
is
moving
the
lace
is
actually
quite
good
tapiocacoloured
foam
very
clear
and
it
probably
takes
on
some
colours
from
the
oak
wood
aroma
is
at
first
all
caramel
sweet
malt
and
butter
sourdough
in
close
definite
wood
notes
though
it
does
not
smell
like
oak
to
memore
like
balsam
the
wood
gives
it
a
dryer
aroma
which
mitigates
the
rich
malt
i
smelt
at
first
i
like
it
it
adds
rather
an
unexpected
nuance
grassy
dusty
hops
are
behind
the
wood
and
malt
raisins
and
cream
some
honey
prunes
lightly
toasted
bread
the
wood
is
even
stronger
once
in
the
mouth
felt
up
front
and
in
the
finish
while
at
first
i
thought
it
masked
some
good
potential
malt
the
oakiness
becomes
very
pleasant
after
a
few
sips
the
malt
gives
butterscotch
and
lactose
a
lowtomedium
dryness
in
the
finish
woody
dusty
but
actually
there
is
almost
no
aftertaste
to
this
beer
taste
is
definitely
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
the
feel
is
a
little
watery
not
very
substantial
in
the
mouth
but
it
makes
the
beer
quite
potable
this
beer
reminds
me
of
some
of
granville
islands
beers
from
bc
woody
cardboardlike
i
like
the
wood
in
this
beers
character
but
there
is
not
much
else
happening
in
the
flavour
profile
it
is
too
light
tasting
too
unoffensive
i
thought
id
try
the
cask
version
since
i
remember
being
a
bit
let
down
by
the
bottled
product
poured
a
nice
amber
gold
topped
by
a
thin
white
head
aroma
was
strong
on
the
malt
side
with
a
hint
of
sulphur
could
be
the
burton
water
refreshing
session
bitter
with
nice
hop
tones
lightinsh
mouhfeel
refreshing
and
drinkable
another
example
of
the
superiority
of
cask
ale
not
my
favorite
ale
but
another
drinkable
one
at
that
all
in
all
not
a
half
bad
pint
you
can
probably
do
a
little
more
exciting
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
just
a
nice
pint
or
two
or
three
than
this
is
a
good
beer

at

decent

bitter
but
nothing
extraordinary
is
going
to
happen
here
the
inconvienient
placement
of
a
label
band
around
the
neck
of
the
bottle
made
it
almost
impossible
to
avoid
pouring
in
a
few
bits
of
yeast
there
is
nothing
on
the
label
about
bottle
conditioning
either
which
makes
it
equally
difficult
to
avoid
flakes
of
yeast
sediment
it
poured
an
amber
beer
with
a
thin
white

that
subsided
to
a

aroma
was
of
light
fruity

a
touch
of

the
flavor

a
nice

into

crisp

the

went

belch
after

a
pretty
average
pale

the

while
this

is
a
perfectly
cromulent

for
a

a

seems
to
be
under
flavored
though
i
had
to
push
myself
along
a
bit
in
order
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
i
did
like
the
low
carbonation
and
medlow
body
of
this
beer
these
qualities
made
for
a
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
because
of
this
pedigree
couldve
been
a
contender
for
a
session
beer
however
there
are
oh
so
many
other
excellent
session
beers
out
there
that
in
addition
to
being
delightfully
easy
to
drink
are
also
thoroughly
interesting

yeasty
taste
seemed
to
be
very
light
at
first
but
then
the
flavors
opened
up
the
more
i
drank
it
fruity
flavors
mainly
apple
is
what
i
noticed
these
fruity
flavors
didnt
seem
coming
from
the
malts
but
rather
from
the
yeast
slight
caramel
and
earthy
flavors
seem
to
be
whats
coming
from
the
malts
hops
become
more
apparent
the
more
i
drank
this
beer
but
it
never
really
becomes
too
bitter
maybe
im
too
used
to
those
american
ipas
the
balance
and
drinkability
in
this
beer
is
extroadinary
the
body
is
light
but
i
do
notice
a
slight
roasty
woodsy
element
to
it
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
long
at
an
english
pub
the
drinkability
is
lowered
slightly
for
its
heaviness
but
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
i
could
happily
spend
a
rainy
day
with
a
good
book
next
to
a
fire
and
pop
pint
after
pint
of
this
not
a
huge
beer
in
any
respect
just
a
very
flavorful
session
brew
me
likey
does
the
yeast
live
in
the
casks
premium
beers
i
guess
that
means
something
else
in
the
uk
i
was
just
a
bit
insulted
by
that
label
so
simplistic
and
silly
sounding
beers
good
tho
16
9
ounce
bottle
overall
a
fine
english
bitter
that
im
sure
tastes
much
better
from
cask
or
in
the
motherland
but
this
does
me
just
fine
when
poured
it
was
a
hazy
brownish
reddish
copper
color
with
some
white
foam
the
smell
of
mild
roasted
malts
and
some
hops
were
very
evident
there
is
a
taste
of
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
bittersweetness
in
the
after
taste
was
pleasant
along
with
taste
and
flavor
of
this
ale
a
pleasant
surprise
to
this
ale
this
is
a
refreshment
for
tastebuds
that
that
are
accustomed
to
a
good
cigar
gin
black
coffee
and
claret
highly
extracted
hops
and
dense
layers
of
roasted
grain
flavors
threaten
to
unbalance
this
beer
as
it
is
light
bodied
to
begin
with
still
i
feel
it
manages
to
make
terrific
sense
if
i
were
a
lawyer
id
drink
this
stuff
overall
impression
though
it
is
not
highly
complex
it
is
quite
a
nice
beer
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
the
oak
is
quite
assertive
so
it
really
perks
up
the
tastebuds
i
had
a
pint
of
this
at
the
halfway
house
in
north
camden
town
in
london
this
ale
was
a
light
creamy
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
the
taste
was
a
nice
light
blend
of
honeyed
hops
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
nice
this
is
just
one
well
made
ale
absolutely
yummy
i
could
have
several
of
these
though
my
wallet
would
suffer
the
poms
really
know
how
to
brew
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
a
few
of
without
getting
too
toasted
and
marstons
pedigree
is
heading
the
list
the
bottle
says
better
brewed
in
wood
and
to
me
its
no
idle
boast
its
also
great
to
see
a
brewery
of
their
standing
not
just
maintain
but
develop
the
traditions
of
brewing
the
burton
union
style
with
an
absloute
pearler
of
a
brew
here
drinkability

this
one
is
well
put
together
and
would
make
a
terrific
session
beer
i
still
dont
drink
the
bottled
version
but
now
ive
moved
nearer
to
staffordshire
my
new
local
sells
good
pedigree
and
it
is
a
great
beer
when
kept
well
medium
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
a
medium
bodied

nice
mild
malts
and
slightly
bitter

very
smooth

sweetish
apples
buttery
taste
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is

finish
is
very
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
slightly
on
the
full
side
for
the
style
its
quite
smooth
and
creamy
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
english
pales
ive
come
across
kind
of
dry
and
sweet
at
the
same
timeis
that
possible
still
for
its
shortcomings
i
could
quaff
a
few
on
short
notice
a
huge
step
up
from
boddingtons
pub
ale
and
a
little
better
than
tetleys
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
a
few
pints
of
pedigree
color
is
light
orange
not
quite
amber
closer
to
yellow
nice
offwhite
foamy
head
with
very
tight
bubbles
and
left
a
skinlike
lace
smell
is
very
faint
and
soft
not
much
mostly
light
citrus
but
very
fresh
and
clean
taste
is
good
very
subtle
flavors
of
nutty
maltiness
and
easy
citrus
hoppiness
thats
dry
and
sweetly
bitter
its
a
very
easy
drinker
light
bodied
clean
fresh
and
a
well
balanced
malty
nutty
bitter
dryness
throughout
smooth
and
subtle
pale
thats
made
for
drinkin
not
my
style
but
very
nice
recomended
fruity
apple
and
pear
on
the
palate
and
nice
bitter
finish
which
would
explain
why
its
called
an
english
bitter
quite
tasty
indeed
very
yummy
overall
i
didnt
rate
this
beer
very
high
for
the
sole
reason
that
it
is
billed
as
a
blend
of
english
pale
and
irish
red
it
doesnt
fit
either
style
very
well
however
it
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
ale
that
i
would
buy
again
this
beer
is
a
little
more
complex
than
it
would
appear
it
is
rich
and
smooth
it
is
not
hoppy
per
the
current
american
fashion
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
flavor
though
not
totally
unique
very
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
tastes
more
like
a
standard
lager
to
me
hints
of
ale
flavor
creep
into
the
finish
reminds
me
a
lot
of
miller
corn
based
and
not
a
lot
to
it
i
will
not
drink
again
i
wasnt
keen
on
this
ale
upon
drinking
the
first
bottle
however
i
have
finally
decided
this
is
an
okay
brew
theres
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
head
starts
out
at
about
half
an
inch
and
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
white
peel
this
is
not
an
offensive
drink
nor
is
it
world
class
but
if
you
just
want
to
enjoy
a
nice
ale
blend
then
this
might
work
for
you
ill
buy
it
again
on
occasion
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
weak
some
light
malts
taste
is
well
balanced
hops
and
a
mild
bitterness
up
front
malts
at
the
finish
some
hints
of
caramel
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
finish
clean
with
a
slight
malty
aftertaste
still
no
bitterness
in
the
end
i
poured
this
average
looking
labeled
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
orangey
amber
looking
concoction
tat
looked
a
little
on
the
cloudy
side
the
head
was
tan
and
decent
the
beer
smelled
pretty
good
like
sweet
rolls
however
the
taste
was
ciderish
much
like
the
crap
i
made
with
the
mr
beer
kit
i
will
not
buy
againyuk
serving
type
bottle
o
for
the
style
advertised
this
is
a
nice
choice
maybe
im
biased
living
so
close
to
the
brewer
but
i
think
id
like
this
if
it
came
from
1000
miles
away
like
the
nose
i
get
a
good
caramel
malt
character
in
the
flavor
which
stands
strong
for
a
moment
as
the
earthy
clean
hop
finish
kicks
in
i
found
it
be
drinkable
and
likable
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
described
a
cross
between
and
english
pale
and
an
irish
red
for
me
i
really
taste
the
irish
red
it
is
a
little
too
light
for
me
with
not
a
great
body
there
is
almost
no
after
taste
to
enjoy
a
buddy
of
mine
picked
some
up
at
a
world
market
in
cleveland
tn
if
i
were
in
a
kentucky
city
for
a
stopover
i
might
enjoy
a
few
cold
ones
and
then
move
onto
something
else
o
disappointing
on
counts
of
both
aroma
quality
and
weak
flavor
a
decent
but
not
particularly
attractive
brew
of
opening
a
daily
pour
i
have
the
feeling
that
the
aim
was
to
introduce
the
budweisier
drinker
to
a
micro
brew
thats
the
kiss
of
death
for
me
im
always
on
the
lookout
for
a
beer
with
a
frugal
price
back
to
trader
joe
for
old
standbys
if
im
going
to
drink
ale
fat
weasel
is
much
better
im
surprised
that
ky
ale
gets
better
marks
than
fw
o
it
pairs
well
with
watching
justified
i
liked
it
but
not
sure
i
would
repeat
it
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
ale
for
the
price
but
also
im
a
bit
of
a
homer
wait
theres
no
barrel
here
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
honey
milder
biscuit
light
apple
and
a
vague
smattering
of
flowers
its
light
and
simple
but
fairly
pleasant
regardless
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
that
pesky
apple
character
playing
a
larger
role
its
this
appleness
that
really
detracts
from
the
positives
a
bit
too
much
for
my
tastes
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
englishesque
brew
one
i
could
see
being
a
mildish
staple
if
i
found
myself
in
kentucky
but
that
damn
apple
character
doesnt
endear
the
beer
to
me
all
that
much
overall
a
great
cheap
session
beer
i
live
in
kentucky
might
be
cheaper
for
me
than
most
o
decent
not
great
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
although
the
taste
seems
a
little
bland
12oz
bottle

a

i

but
nothing
ground
shaking
here
well
put
together
for
what
it
is
though
not
sure
that
id
buy
it
again
i
might
like
this
beer
more
if
it
didnt
remind
me
of
magic
hat
9
on
so
many
levels
but
prejudice
aside
its
smooth
flavor
profile
is
consistent
its
smooth
perhaps
i
have
cracked
the
secret
recipe
of
the
9
anyways
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
interesting
mix
of
styles
o
a
good
beer
that
does
lexington
well
bourbon
barrel
ale
is
better
though
and
more
unique
so
if
youre
buying
beer
in
lexington
spend
the
extra
dollar
and
get
the
bourbon
beer
in
conclusion
a
pretty
adequate
beer
with
enough
off
notes
to
keep
you
from
coming
back
so
heres
to
comrades
near
and
far
so
raise
a
glass
raise
your
voices
rjt
overall
a
very
enjoyable
simple
ale
a
nice
casual
goto
beer
for
the
spring
and
summer
overall
an
average
session
ale
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
overall
i
was
somewhat
impressed
by
this
beer
some
good
flavor
but
still
light
enough
to
have
several
of
ill
probably
pick
up
some
more
of
this
o
nothing
really
great
however
it
still
manages
to
be
a
pleasantly
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
choice
for
intoducing
someone
to
craft
beer
either
the
first
was
okay
the
second
made
me
wish
i
had
ordered
something
else
o
decent
english
pale
comparable
to
a
bass
if
you
ask
me
nothing
groundbreaking
but
not
bad
either
especially
since
this
is
a
local
offering
for
me
seems
to
pair
pretty
well
with
most
food
types
since
it
is
pretty
mild
it
does
a
decent
job
supporting
most
food
offerings
without
getting
in
the
way
im
not
quite
as
intricate
as
others
with
my
reviews
but
i
will
say
i
do
recommend
this
beer
it
is
not
the
best
beer
on
earth
but
certainly
makes
for
a
great
regional
brew

it
slowly
faded
before
gently
resting
as
a
tight

the
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
insignificant
still
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
decent
the
nose
doesnt
say
much
all
i
get
is
an
impression
that
this
is
an
ale
because
there
is
very
vague
fruitiness
the
hops
contribute
minimal
aromas
nothing
tries
to
standout
this
is
far
from
a
bad
beer
honestly
it
doesnt
taste
much
of
anything
nothing
is
very
distinct
and
the
muddled
flavors
do
little
for
me

some

without
any

there
was

beer
that
certainly
never
overwhelms
the
palate
with
just
subtle
hints
of
hops
and
a
heavenly
bitter
after
taste
for
company
not
a
beer
for
a
good
night
of
darting
overall
a
big
letdown
not
the
nice
u
k
bitter
i
was
hoping
for
seems
like
a
light
beer
to
begin
wtih
then
just
gets
so
destroyed
by
the
nitro
its
sad
that
this
is
even
a
thing
its
ok
and
i
can
see
why
its
so
popular
with
some
rjt
o
the
nitrogen
helps
to
improve
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
as
smooth
compared
to
other
beers
available
in
nitrocans
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
not
quite
as
smooth
as
some
of
the
other
nitrocan
beers
that
i
have
experienced
easy
to
drink
and
with
such
a
low
abv
definitely
sessionable
please
bring
to
the
us
market
this
will
always
be
a
better
alternative
to
the
mass
produced
yellow
beers
here
in
the
us
so
this
is
definitely
a
nice
summer
type
quaffer
overall
its
a
perfectly
drinkable
english
ale
while
not
being
a
particularly
exciting
one
i
do
love
the
effect
the
nitro
gives
it
and
if
that
just
makes
me
a
sucker
for
a
gimmick
then
i
guess
im
a
sucker
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
final
thoughts
john
smiths
extra
smooth
proves
that
a
low
abv
beer
can
pack
in
some
flavor
and
be
enjoyable
would
like
to
see
more
brewers
pushing
below
the
4
abv
mark
and
making
true
session
beers
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
this
is
one
that
you
can
drink
gallons
of
in
the
pub
the
nitro
helps
a
ton
ok
brew
overall
goes
down
easy
comforting
feel
and
taste
somewhat
heavy
but
it
just
adds
some
character
i
could
see
starting
a
great
britain
beer
tasting
with
this
ale
it
certainly
would
not
alter
your
taste
perception
of
what
ever
bitter
or
pale
ale
that
comes
next
im
afraid
for
even
those
who
dont
drink
beer
the
blatant
nonoffensive
qualities
of
this
may
seem
a
tad
dull
but
boy
does
it
refresh
i
note
that
i
ignore
the
cans
instructions
to
serve
cold
and
serve
at
proper
british
ale
temp
pours
a
clear
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
a
slight
caramel
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
but
is
very
mild
and
lacking
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
is
not
very
tasty
in
my
opinion
around
my
expectations
and
thats
not
bad
a
true
session
ale
to
be
had
in
the
us
overall
an
average
nitro
english
bitter
not
on
the
same
level
as
old
speckled
hen
or
tetleys
but
better
than
boddingtons
at
7
99
a
4
pack
the
price
is
alright
and
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
every
other
nitroed
english
palebittercream
alewhathaveyou
ive
had
has
been
at
least
decent
so
this
guys
gonna
haveta
be
tried
thinketh
i
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
bronze
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
barley
light
greens
and
a
touch
of
biscuit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
touch
more
biscuit
a
drop
of
honey
and
a
twinge
of
spicy
greens
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
little
english
ale
something
i
wouldnt
necessarily
stock
all
the
time
but
something
i
would
never
mind
partaking
in
the
body
was
typically
good
for
the
style
full
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
was
good
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
nice
but
not
notable
take
on
the
style
worth
grabbing
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
almost
pint
of
bitters
overall
very
nice
english
ale
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
malts
fruit
and
light
bitterness
quite
flavoursome
for
an
english
mild
only
way
i
would
have
it
is
if
it
was
on
sale
though
au80
a
case
2012
is
way
too
much
the
color
is
darker
than
expected
the
aroma
is
weak
but
nice
it
keeps
producing
lace
overall
it
is
as
expected
a
nice
english
ale
from
england
go
figure
served
from
nitrocan
into
a
duckrabbit
nonic
poured
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
the
pour
really
reminded
me
of
a
guinness
with
the
head
consuming
the
entire
beer
and
working
its
way
up
slowly
to
form
the
final
head
nice
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cream
grain
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cream
grain
earth
and
subtle
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
almost
velvety
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
brew
i
have
to
say
the
pour
on
this
one
was
pretty
cool
as
it
looked
like
a
guinness
only
it
was
a
pale
ale
however
that
is
where
the
fun
stopped
on
this
one
there
was
really
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
one
which
really
made
it
a
bit
of
a
buzzkill
for
me
very
light
on
all
aspects
so
good
for
the
nonrobust
beer
drinkers
out
there
but
if
you
like
loads
of
flavor
and
complexity
avoid
this
one
trust
me
you
will
thank
me
if
you
have
the
option
a
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
keeping
me
up
to
date

the

oz

can
has
a
brown
color
with
a
12
inch

smell
is
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
malts
a
touch
of
nuts
just
a
bit
of
hops
like
its
advertised
very
smooth
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
session
beer
very
smooth
and
creamy
serve
best
room
temp
or
take
out
of
the
refrigerator
for
10
mins
before
serving
one
of
uk
finest
bitters
hard
to
find
in
usa
but
some
liquor
stores
in
mn
are
now
carrying
my
favorite
bitter
if
you
enjoy
boddingtons
try
john
smiths
extra
smooth
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
feel
like
this
is
a
session
ale
i
could
quaff
all
day
o
this
is
pretty
good
i
had
never
heard
of
it
but
its
pretty
tasty
a
nitrocan
from
pinocchios
on
friday
gets
us
out
of
the
gate
and
the
crack
released
a
buncha
gas
while
the
glug
caused
a
cascading
action
that
resulted
in
a
finger
of
dense
lighttan
head
color
was
a
deep
copperbrownish
hue
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
was
quite
malty
very
biscuitlike
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
as
the
result
of
the
widget
and
the
taste
was
only
moderately
bitter
it
had
a
pleasant
biscuit
maltiness
up
front
followed
by
a
light
bitterness
before
the
swallow
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
pleasant
this
would
be
an
excellent
candidate
for
a
session
beer
especially
at
the
beach
but
as
a
beer
geek
speaking
id
love
to
see
some
more
traditional
english
bitters
in
my
area
that
have
a
lot
stronger
character
than
this
this
definitely
doesnt
seem
like
a
good
representation
of
what
the
style
can
truly
be
o
overall
the
nitrowidget
enchances
the
smooth
creamy
body
has
some
sility
maltiness
and
low
bitterness
levels
nice
beginning
though
the
flavor
tends
to
lean
and
thin
out
deeper
into
the
drink
dont
know
if
i
could
tackle
two
in
one
sitting
great
visual
but
dives
downhill
from
there
o
great
with
a
bath
pasty
from
the
sandwich
shop
round
the
corner
braised
beef
potatoes
and
onions
i
see
why
this
is
so
popular
in
stores
notes
its
sessionable
and
overall
not
too
shaby
of
a
brew
cheers
from
the

stamped

sampled
on
july

2012
the
pour
is
agitated
by
the
widget
explosion
with
a
medium
copper
amber
tone
and
a
soft
silky
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
rather
bland
with
little
to
talk
about
but
bread
and
grains
the
body
is
smooth
and
medium
it
tastes
better
than
i
thought
it
might
given
the
aroma
with
an
upfront
sweet
malt
character
followed
by
a
moderate
bitterness
this
probably
would
be
a
pretty
good
pub
beer
body
is
just
a
shade
below
medium
carbonation
is
smooth
and
reserved
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
glass
the
watery
nature
of
the
beer
became
tiresome
worth
a
try
if
you
like
nitro
english
bitters
but
doesnt
stand
out
from
its
competitors
in
any
particulalry
favorable
way
a
small
step
below
something
like
tetleys
o
how
in
the
hell
did
i
miss
this
one
for
so
long
this
is
an
exceptional
english
bitter
i
love
the
nitrocan
presentation
and
everything
about
this
comes
together
to
create
one
of
the
better
session
beers
ive
had
i
will
most
certainly
be
returning
to
this
a
word
to
my
degenerate
friends
youll
be
seeing
this
at
future
house
parties
o
not
particularly
complex
nothing
amazing
but
i
find
myself
coming
to
this
beer
and
boddingtons
pub
ale
occasionally
simply
for
its
simplicity
more
complexity
than
a
standard
lager
i
recently
read
that
this
the
top
selling
bitter
in
the
u
k
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
try
poured
from
the
nitro
can
a
clear
deep
copper
color
with
that
one
finger
creamy
cascading
head
a
little
toastiness
and
light
metallic
notes
in
the
noseit
will
not
blow
ya
away
but
its
not
designed
to
toasted
bready
malts
are
the
main
component
on
the
palate
with
a
mild
mineral
note
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
big
seller
its
low
in
alcohol
and
has
some
decent
subtle
flavorsgood
for
what
it
is
no
doubt
o
a
completely
forgettable
massproduced
beer
not
very
drinkable
o
its
okay
but
its
pretty
bland
i
could
have
a
couple
if
i
was
after
something
a
little
lower
alcohol
but
i
would
get
over
it
very
quickly
o
an
easytodrink
beer
that
is
not
overly
complex
which
for
me
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
nothing
too
memorable
about
this
but
just
a
hint
above
average
thanks
casey
a
bland
massproduced
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
lovely
but
it
lacks
aroma
flavour
and
character
could
almost
pass
for
lightly
sweetened
water
why
drink
this
when
there
are
so
many
great
beers
out
there
o
this
is
a
satisfactory
beer
it
fails
at
providing
anything
new
or
exciting
to
the
world
of
beer
but
stylistically
it
works
i
probably
wont
actively
seek
this
out
anytime
soon
but
if
i
was
offered
this
by
someone
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
hey
there
are
far
far
worse
offerings
out
there
carlton
cold
is
a
prime
example
one
big
problem
not
much
flavour
and
a
very
watery
body
not
even
any
alcohol
make
the
wateriness
more
enjoyable
because
the
alcohol
content
is
so
low
so
it
was
like
creamy
mildly
beery
water
if
thats
what
you
want
go
for
it
otherwise
dont
expect
anything
more
exciting
than
that
from
this
beer
o
easy
drinker
good
session
beer
very
common
in
most
pubs
i
have
been
to
in
england
nothing
fancy
just
a
good
everyday
beer
cheers
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
a
pleasant
fairly
simple
beer
does
not
get
the
heart
pumping
or
the
taste
buds
dancing
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
easy
going
low
in
alcohol
and
simple
you
could
do
much
worse
question
why
on
earth
do
they
say
serve
cold
on
the
can
m
the
clue
is
in
the
name
very
smooth
on
your
tounge
as
someone
has
previously
reviewed
like
guinness
very
nice
overall
to
be
honest
a
pretty
average
beer
tastewise
but
one
i
have
a
real
soft
spot
for
ill
keep
picking
them
up
on
occasion
at
the
bottlo
as
they
really
take
me
back
more
than
a
few
years
to
hazy
memories
of
friday
night
pub
crawls
in
the
york
winter
with
uncle
steve
and
the
boys
dr
cheap
in
glasgow
but
still
shite
compared
to
other
offerings
a
nice
mild
easy
drinking
ale
with
decent
flavour
a
good
beer
well
it
has
a
widget
certainly
not
as
good
as
boddingtons
color
is
a
nice
orange
to
amber
and
it
pours
an
interesting
head
it
laces
and
sticks
to
the
pint
glass
but
the
taste
is
rather
bland
some
malts
but
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
below
average
at
least
i
only
got
one
pint
of
it
however
when
in
london
i
did
expect
that
though
when
i
heard
that
hiss
and
saw
the
cascading
effect
that
this
beer
would
be
very
watery
but
at
the
same
time
very
drinkable
i
also
think
this
would
be
a
very
good
light
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
guinness
but
have
a
hard
time
dealing
with
its
darker
nature
very
light
accsessible
and
refreshing
copper
color
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
body
that
will
in
the
same
direction
a
taste
of
rye
bread
in
the
mouth
surrounded
by
a
creamy
rich
lather
and
a
rather
discrete
hops
a
quasiimaginary
carbonation
as
extra
smooth
but
not
really
exciting
the
finish
is
bitter
but
without
being
excessive
for
a
beer
style
bitters
a
decent
nitro
beer
much
better
than
most
the
other
similar
nitro
beers
not
something
i
would
recommend
over
anything
else
but
you
could
do
worse
notes
decent
beer
for
something
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
especially
at
places
with
limited
selection
in
the
uk
at
least
d
high
light
taste
and
abv
traditional
british
style
overall
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
pretty
offensive
not
highly
but
decently
so
d
moderate
4
0
abv
makes
it
definitely
drinkable
drinkablity
a
tasty
ale
that
is
extremely
portable
in
the
can
it
produces
a
consistently
good
pour
unlike
some
pubs
great
session
brew
overall
a
sturdy
drink
that
is
very
cheap
and
is
a
good
day
to
day
beer
what
can
i
say
nitro
appearance
is
very
hard
to
beat
a
ruddy
ale
hazed
with
ultrafine
bubbles
which
cascade
upward
into
a
spotless
porcelain
head
great
sticking
and
retention
caramel
corn
toffee
sweet
tea
and
even
some
rose
wine
and
strawberries
crop
up
in
the
nose
with
just
a
light
dusting
of
hops
to
provide
a
veneer
of
leafy
resin
mild
in
flavor
but
wellrounded
and
it
stands
up
to
overchilling
as
it
is
usually
served
with
a
light
woody
base
hollow
caramel
malts
and
a
paperthin
layer
of
leafy
hops
easy
drinking
with
a
mouthfeel
that
actually
does
approximate
proper
real
ale
but
the
flavor
doesnt
exactly
leave
me
wanting
more
nonetheless
it
is
a
nice
thirstslaker
and
id
certainly
be
happy
to
have
it
again
especially
in
situations
like
this
where
all
the
other
beers
are
boring
pale
lagers
mouthfeel
is
guinness
like
creamy
but
a
bit
watery
a
clear
bronze
colour
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
lasted
to
the
last
drop
aroma
was
not
strong
but
slightly
bready
and
malty
taste
was
the
same
with
good
malt
offset
by
a
clean
bitterness
the
very
low
fine
carbonation
was
typical
and
gave
this
a
smooth
mouthfeel
which
contributed
to
a
good
drinkability
score
im
sure
the
brits
have
many
better
and
more
complex
bitters
available
but
this
one
was
pleasant
without
being
outstanding
if
it
were
cheaper
in
oz
id
give
it
a
constant
workout
to
improve
the
aroma
was
pretty
average
the
beer
is
already
gone
it
is
very
smooth
maybe
a
bit
too
smooth
to
the
point
of
being
watery
just
doesnt
have
much
body
to
it
definitely
an
enjoyable
flavour
though
and
this
is
definitely
a
beer
of
which
you
could
throw
a
few
back
with
the
lads
and
thats
what
it
comes
down
to
in
the
end
the
head
is
very
dense
and
creamy
and
the
body
is
pretty
thin
with
a
low
soft
carbonation
pretty
standard
for
an
epa
overall
a
certainly
smooth
ale
that
lacks
any
real
depth
of
flavor
i
was
going
to
give
it
higher
scores
but
it
is
rather
dull
its
just
a
creamy
easy
drinking
pub
ale
john
smiths
does
the
job
one
of
those
beers
you
can
find
in
pubs
where
there
isnt
real
ale
and
this
is
always
good
to
go
nice
and
smooth
and
this
is
the
more
creamy
version
can
be
a
slightly
wooden
taste
at
times
but
that
is
alright
nothing
too
bad
about
this
one
solid
beer
drinkability
its
a
shame
i
cant
get
this
great
english
session
ale
here
in
the
states
actually
its
probably
best
i
cant
get
it
here
because
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
on
a
daily
basis
if
youre
ever
in
england
looking
for
a
creamy
lightly
bitter
nitro
canned
beer
then
you
should
pick
this
one
up
just
make
sure
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
because
you
dont
want
to
miss
the
show
this
is
a
quick
quaffing
beeer
at
best
and
not
recommended
by
me
definitely
well
drinkable
d

if
this
beer
had
a
little
more
taste
to
it
i
would
love
it
as
it
stands
its
like
drinking
water
with
a
beer
appearance
d
would
be
a
good
session
ale
typically
do
english
beers
i
still
do
appreciate
their
smoothness
and
drinkability
d
good
beer
to
have
while
sitting
in
a
pub
and
you
will
definitly
want
a
few
like
all
nitro
beers
this
brew
looks
really
good
a
khakiish
colour
cascading
effects
leaves
a
creamy
off
white
head
and
a
dark
copper
body
the
head
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
and
stays
for
the
entire
time
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
the
smell
its
very
malty
and
leaving
me
not
quite
sure
if
i
like
it
it
remided
very
much
of
the
smell
of
malt
extract
at
first
the
taste
is
almost
nonexistant
i
really
couldnt
pick
out
much
from
it
there
were
some
flavours
there
just
extremely
milld
however
as
the
beer
warmed
there
was
a
slight
malt
sweetness
that
was
failry
enjoyable
but
still
on
the
minimal
side
mouthfeel
was
really
good
though
very
smooth
very
creamy
and
just
really
enjoyable
all
round
honestly
drinkability
could
be
a
5
on
this
if
there
was
just
a
little
more
flavour
the
extra
smooth
is
no
lie
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
flavour
to
go
with
the
smoothness
john
smiths
extra
smooth
bitter
is
the
famous
british
beer
with
the
no
nonsense
attitude
it
was
launched
in
1995
alongside
john
smiths
bitter
and
has
become
the
uks
no
1
ale
brewed
at
the
famous
john
smiths
brewery
in
tadcaster
since
1847
john
smiths
is
supported
by
a
high
profile
marketing
campaign
led
by
no
nonsense
man
tv
poster
and
in
outlet
advertising
have
driven
john
smiths
extra
smooth
to
its
position
as
a
clear
market
leader
and
top
five
beer
brand
md
are
probably
this
beers
selling
point
it
was
slightly
watery
but
very
silky
in
the
mouth
there
was
no
carbonation
however
this
just
added
to
its
blandness
definitely
drinkable
if
only
because
there
is
so
little
taste
or
smell
to
offend
you
unless
you
actually
are
offended
by
a
lack
of
taste
and
smell
a
lacklustre
offering
indeed
dont
bother
dirtying
a
glass
to
drink
this
one
this
is
a
copper
colored
brew
that
poured
a
creamy
white
head
leaving
a
nice
lacing
nose
was
kind
of
malty
and
wheaty
and
really
not
much
more
than
that
taste
had
a
hint
of
apple
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
this
was
a
thin
bodied
beer
flat
with
the
saving
grace
being
the
smooth
finish
this
is
sessionable
at
4
0
abv
but
not
a
very
good
beer
by
no
stretch
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
under
a
very
creamy
12
finger
eggshell
white
head
that
lasts
forever
and
generates
some
nice
sheets
of
lace
the
nose
is
mild
but
appropriate
for
the
style
with
a
note
of
hops
along
with
smooth
malt
the
mouth
is
lightly
carbonated
and
light
in
weight
although
the
bit
of
head
that
comes
with
every
sip
adds
a
cottony
softness
to
the
liquid
the
taste
is
mild
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
metallic
astringency
to
go
with
the
dark
bread
malt
reminds
me
of
my
days
in
oxford
no
complaints
the
smell
on
this
one
is
pretty
appealing
but
the
taste
could
use
some
real
work
its
a
bit
flat
and
lacks
real
flavor
along
those
lines
the
mouthfeel
suffers
from
being
too
thin
737
either
way
this
is
fairly
drinkable
nothing
thats
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
thats
probably
not
what
the
expectation
is
from
this
beer
not
a
bad
ale
but
has
been
mass
produced
now
a
fair
ale
on
tap
in
england
very
good
beer
and
is
also
considered
a
bitter
not
bitter
at
all
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffly
white
head
that
dissapates
fairly
quickly
it
tastes
a
little
bit
watered
down
good
maltiness
smooth
and
crisp
very
drinkable
but
this
bitter
isnt
as
good
as
other
ones
on
draught
at
the
original
hard
rock
cafe
in
london
of
all
places
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
thin
lacing
mellow
malt
aroma
very
smooth
drinking
with
flavors
of
malt
brown
sugar
sweet
fruit
and
hops
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
but
does
not
last
very
long
decent
overall
but
could
be
better
the
taste
is
also
on
the
delicate
side
on
the
other
hand
its
a
smooth
it
should
be
mild
however
there
is
a
burned
tone
with
hints
of
caramel
thick
cream
and
a
passing
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
very
gentle
with
some
hints
of
rye
bread
and
somewhere
in
the
background
mild
hops
considering
the
price
get
a
double
diamond
or
something
dont
bother
with
this
its
a
nasty
peice
of
work
all
over
pours
a
deep
golden
colour
topped
by
a
head
that
starts
of
thick
and
large
and
after
a
minute
settles
to
minimum
aroma
consists
of
citrus
and
honey
hints
citrus
flavour
and
very
moderate
hop
hints
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
this
has
the
result
of
this
beer
being
very
drinkable
great
brew
freshly
tapped
in
an
old
1600s
pub
the
nags
head
in
bristol
england
so
the
setting
may
introduce
some
favorable
bias
the
extra
smooth
bitter
is
dull
tanamber
in
color
the
somewhat
thin
body
gives
way
to
the
plentiful
tealike
hops
which
are
especially
noticed
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
ale
changes
complexion
half
way
through
revealing
a
woody
character
and
some
sweet
and
citrus
flavors
while
mellowing
out
even
further
the
foamy
white
head
doesnt
last
very
long
dark
reddish
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
not
much
of
a
smell
maybe
a
little
bready
though
i
find
it
really
hard
to
define
the
taste
its
a
bit
like
the
smell
bready
and
with
a
slight
roasted
tone
finished
of
in
a
bitter
way
should
be
served
at
1012c
golden
slightly
amber
color
thick

this

beer
i
hate

gotta
say
i
hate
the
nitro

thingy
way
too
creamy
and
no

to
boot
very

pretty
crappy

you
ask

a
session
beer
is
what
scottish
courage
was
shooting
for
and
if
so
i
guess
theyve
met
their
goal
there
just
isnt
enough
substance
here
for
my
taste
imho
this
is
a
subordinary
bitter
beautiful
golden
color
with
thick
foamy
head
that
fades
quickly
with
nice
lacing
light
citrus
taste
with
sweet
breadiness
from
the
two
row
barley
just
enough
hop
finish
to
make
it
interesting
definitely
a
great
beer
when
youre
packing
the
cooler
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
at
the
beach
good
for
a
hot
day
with
friends
nothing
special
light
and
crisp
summery
indeed
perfect
for
the
patio
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
beer
too
hoppy
for
my
likes
in
a
refreshing
summer
type
beer
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
yolk
color
clear
and
laced
foam
like
a
lite
pils
low
malt
profile
definitely
sessionable
but
not
my
favorite
not
bitter
in
the
slightest
light
bodied
light
carbonation
would
consider
this
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
on

sweet
almost
honeylike
and
bready
malt
dominant
with
minerally
notes
a
hint
of
lemon
and
herbal
hops
adding
intrigue
finishes
fairly
clean
with
light
bitterness
seems
a
bit
hollow
at
the
finish
had
a
pitcher
of
this
with
my
bro
in
law
this
past
summer
it
was
really
nice
very
refreshing
lemony
taste
great
carbonation
but
the
lemon
taste
got
to
us
and
we
had
to
switch
it
up
in
the
next
pitcher
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
smell
of
citrus
and
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
the
taste
was
similar
with
hop
citrus
coming
in
first
with
lemon
peel
and
grapefruit
but
them
sweet
spices
such
as
nutmeg
make
an
appearance
to
give
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
body
very
refreshing
for
the
summer
light
enough
for
a
hot
summer
night
but
smooth
creamy
and
tasty
enough
to
be
considered
a
good
tasting
beer
overall
light
fruity
astringent
wellcarbonated
but
not
overly
so
a
wellbalanced
craft
summer
ale
would
buy
again
sam
overall
light

complex
enough
to
be
a

brooklyn
summer
ale
is
just
not
a
very
good
beer
for
me
it
epitomizes
the
problems
with
summer
beer
its
light
body
and
light
flavor
are
simply
not
interesting
inadequate
carbonation
only
makes
things
worse
the
80
on
ba
and
the
style
listing
being
english
pale
ale
is
a
quite
deceptive
this
is
mediocre
to
bad
beer
that
doesnt
even
get
the
simple
task
of
quenching
ones
thirst
right
o
this
is
a
summer
session
ale
it
has
good
mouthfeel
unfortunately
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
wheat
beer
style
and
flavor
i
am
sure
this
would
appeal
to
people
that
like
this
style
and
want
to
have
a
few
beers
on
a
hot
day
crystal
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
bone
white
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
bread
sweet
pilsner
malt
offset
with
some
floral
and
spicy
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
earth
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
sweet
bready
malt
with
enough
spicy
hop
to
balance
but
add
a
bit
of
non
descript
fruit
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
a
watery
mouthfeel
nice
enough
easy
drinking
beer
i
prefer
a
bit
more
flavor
and
body
but
this
would
do
fairly
well
on
a
sweltering
summers
day
like
many
summer
ales
this
offering
is
quite
sessionable
the
problem
is
that
the
flavor
really
isnt
there
o
not
bad
but
there
at
better
too
light
not
enough
flavor
to
distinguish
from
the
run
of
the
mill
m
well
carbonated
just
enough
for
this
style
very
refreshing
great
brew
this
may
have
become
my
favorite
summer
session
beer
as
the
malts
are
diverse
and
full
but
the
easy
drinkability
remains
intact
this
is
a
pale
golden
summery
brew
light
crisp
and
refreshing
the
head
is
bright
white
but
small
and
the
complexion
is
clear
the
aromaisof
grainanssome
american
hops
lightmodestly
fruityand
subtle
malt
it
is
not
an
intense
beer
lightish
in
body
the
beer
is
suitable
for
the
season
nice
o
it
is
what
it
is
a
nice
simple
easy
drinking
epa
when
you
drink
this
you
wont
be
tempted
to
dissect
it
you
will
say
mmm
and
want
to
drink
more
this
is
a
nice
summer
ale
highly
recommended
for
sitting
on
the
porch
fishing
or
just
hanging
out
fairly
disappointing
given
the
reputation
of
brooklyn
brewery
the
taste
was
pretty
much
straight
down
the
middle
and
completely
average
with
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
your
runofthemill
big
brewery
english
pale
ales
that
are
much
easier
and
cheaper
to
get
a
hold
of
in
the
uk
not
one
i
can
recommend
especially
if
you
live
in
the
uk
as
there
is
much
better
out
there
o
nothing
too
impressive
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
and
some
lacing
as
consumed
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
little
bit
of
floral
hop
taste
is
big
on
the
bread
malt
with
some
underlying
citrus
flavor
that
blends
with
the
malt
for
a
very
pleasant
finish
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
great
summer
beer
as
it
consists
of
a
smooth
almost
creamy
feel
that
dissipates
into
a
clean
finish
always
a
goto
summer
beer
for
me
golden
perfectly
clear
and
brilliant
in
the
light
with
a
fluffy
white
head
pale
malts
citrus
and
very
slight
floral
hops
flavors
are
light
but
nicely
balanced
light
bodied
refreshing
and
the
english
yeast
lends
a
little
zing
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
nice
a
miss
for
brooklyn
not
so
good
a
nice
light
sessionable
ale
with
some
nice
flavor
and
body
very
easy
to
like
and
enjoy
especially
on
a
warm
sunny
day
overall
there
arent
many
beers
out
there
that
totally
turn
me
off
so
this
was
a
surprise
and
not
a
pleasant
one
o
a
great
summer
ale
for
any
outdoor
occasion
i
wish
it
was
90
degrees
outside
and
summery
to
fully
enjoy
the
bright
sweetness
this
ale
has
to
offer
but
this
is
chicago
and
its
35
this
is
an
outdoor
4th
of
july
kind
of
beer
and
at

you
can
have
your
fun

maybe
pair
with

mixed
green

grilled

citrus
deserts
like
lemon
bars
or
key
lime
pie
o
i
was
surprised
this
ended
up
being
brooklyn
summer
ale
i
thought
it
would
fare
better
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
next
summer
a
reasonable
brew
but
a
bit
too
adjunct
side
for
me
this
is
a
nice
and
pleasant
brew
the
flavors
are
matched
fairly
well
the
finish
lingers
with
malts
easy
hot
weather
quaffer
overall
this
is
a
great
session
beer
very
light
and
easy
drinking
would
make
a
great
improvement
to
anyone
looking
for
an
quality
beer
on
a
hot
day
overall
its
a
good
offering
from
brooklyn
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
actually
as
summer
beers
go
its
one
of
my
least
favorites
if
im
going
to
drink
a
brooklyn
beer
for
the
summer
season
id
rather
have
a
pennant
ale
55
not
a
very
complex
or
intriguing
ale
offers
a
relatively
straightforward
bland
pale
character
refreshing
and
tasty
when
cold
with
some
bright
citrus
and
dry
florals
that
are
quite
easy
to
drink
without
much
complaint
but
i
wont
be
intrigued
to
pick
up
more
unfortunately
this
only
reinforces
my
distaste
for
beers
labeled
summer
anything
it
clearly
suffers
from
an
identity
crisis
and
falls
short
in
almost
every
category
not
something
i
would
buy
or
recommend
buying
overall
i
pretty
dissappointed
i
thought
brooklyn
was
a
good
brewery
but
i
guess
you
cant
win
them
all
lemony
and
doughy
to
smell
and
to
taste
grassy
and
somewhat
sweet
noticeable
carbonation
gives
it
a
bright
mouth
feel
not
liking
the
doughiness
of
it
however
in
the
end
comes
across
as
simply
a
very
average
beer
one
of
the
great
summer
beers
of
the
northeast
and
now
that
its
canned
its
even
better
a
light
golden
color
clear
with
a
creamy
white
head
it
smells
like
pilsner
malts
english
ale
yeast
and
a
crisp
fruity
juicy
hop
finish
more
than
is
common
in
a
summer
brew
in
taste
i
get
a
nice
combination
of
lighter
malts
as
well
as
some
citrus
fruit
ruby
red
grapefruit
mostly
but
a
little
lemon
too
a
touch
of
spice
from
the
yeast
is
evident
in
the
finish
as
well
effervescent
carbonation
is
this
beers
best
feature
it
keeps
it
light
and
bright
summery
clean
finish
ill
take
another
please
notes
this
is
a
nice
little
summer
sessioner
that
tastes
great
right
out
of
the
can
oa
nice
light
summer
beer
for
those
really
hot
days
tastes
looks
and
smells
like
a
magic
hat
9
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
softer
and
the
apricot
is
less
pronounced
replaced
by
a
little
lemon
but
really
not
much
special
here
which
is
disappointing
considering
how
many
folks
rave
about
this
beer
on
here
overall
beats
out
sam
summer
ale
in
almost
every
way
as
summer
brews
go
this
is
outright
grand
i
enjoyed
and
i
think
fans
of
this
style
would
definitely
appreciate

this

its
a

could

i
like

i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
into
the
fall
season
not
a
typical
summer
brew
for
sure
i
definitely
like
this
more
than
the
average
summer
wheat
beers
i
have
tried
this
would
be
perfect
for
those
hot
summer
evenings
but
not
so
much
during
the
hot
part
of
the
day
dthrough
the
roof
definitely
sessionable
as
it
is
only
5
alcohol
and
very
very
easy
to
drink
its
also
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
this
for
summer
consumption
this
is
a
very
solid
summer
beer
and
english
pale
ale
lots
of
hops
with
just
enough
sweetness
and
dryness
to
be
a
great
summer
beer
loved
it
had
this
one
on
tap
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
citrusy
aroma
with
a
kick
of
floral
hops
theres
a
sweet
caramel
malt
presence
at
first
then
you
get
a
citruslemon
zest
that
coincides
with
the
hoppy
finish
very
crisp
and
clean
with
some
fairly
biting
carbonation
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
didnt
really
expect
much
from
this
one
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
overall
im
a
bit
disappointed
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
notes
still
not
a
bit
disappointed
with
brooklyn
distributing
here
in
nashville
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
their
offerings
d
although
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
theres
nothing
particularly
special
about
this
beer
that
makes
it
stand
out
it
might
be
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
a
food
when
you
are
looking
for
something
light
that
doesnt
have
a
strong
taste
this
is
highly
carbonated
similar
to
an
ipa
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
2
in
a
sitting
once
again
im
not
disappointed
with
a
brooklyn
offering
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
to
say
the
least
no
overpowering
full
flavors
but
still
nice
sipper
would
love
to
drink
this
on
a
warm
summers
day
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
in
here
and
it
goes
down
easy
next
time
i
see
these
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
6
pack
instead
of
a
single
bottle
12oz
bottle
nice
golden
color
with
good
carbonation
aroma
is
very
simple
some
citrus
but
much
faded
since
i
bought
it
fresh
a
month
ago
pretty
full
for
a
summer
ale
but
none
the
less
refreshing
on
a
warmer
day
bit
of
hop
but
then
again
there
was
more
when
i
had
it
last
not
brooklyns
best
offering
but
a
solid
summer
brew
when
fresher
drinkable
and
refreshing
enough
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
jammed
this
in
my
luggage
coming
back
from
texas
made
it
under
the
50lb
limit
which
was
awesome
this
is
a
great
beer
golden
color
lacing
head
mouthfeel
was
light
and
sweetsomewhat
floral
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
light
refreshing
wellmade
solid
brewery
and
would
jam
it
in
my
suitcase
anytime
d
wonderful
light
refreshing
very
drinkable
i
would
be
interested
in
tasting
a
variance
of
temperatures
to
see
where
it
performs
best
stm

overall
refreshing
if
a
bit
dissapointing
offering
from
mr
oliver
everything
is
a
bit
too
understated
for
an
english
pale
ale
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
than
an
english
one
crisper
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
light
crystal
malt
nuttiness
in
an
otherwise
pale
malt
base
good
hop
finish
although
it
is
short
lived
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
di
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
have
to
be
honest
its
no
brooklyn
lager
that
is
still
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
drinkability
a
light
summer
ale
and
nothing
else
lacks
a
lot
of
complexity
i
prefer
the
sierra
nevada
summer
lager
even
though
thats
a
different
style
an
average
ale
over
all
this
would
be
extremely
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
any
other
time
though
average
dman
anyone
could
just
drink
the
mess
out
of
this
all
day
long
and
be
very
happy
a
good
summertime
beer
indeed
d
great
summer
time
ale
one
of
my
favorites
by
brooklyn
brewery
perfect
for
when
its
hot
out
id
prefer
it
over
most
summer
ales
cheers
d
i
really
liked
this
brew
it
was
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
are
pretty
average
but
the
crispness
light
body
and
refreshing
flavors
make
it
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
now
that
ive
got
that
off
my
chest
the
beer
itself
is
quite
good
its
hard
to
find
a
good
example
of
the
cream
ale
style
so
this
is
a
welcome
addition
to
my
fridge
during
hot
weather
poured
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
color
was
a
golden
amber
with
a
white
froathy
head
the
head
left
small
amounts
clinging
to
the
sides
small
amounts
of
carbonation
was
constantly
rising
aroma
was
slighty
fruity
orangesberries
with
yeasty
white
bread
taste
was
sweet
maybe
with
a
small
touch
of
soapy
felt
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
could
be
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
4
brooklyns
summer
ale
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
it
isnt
to
flavorful
to
overwhelm
nor
is
it
too
bland
to
make
it
uninteresting
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summer
brew
ale
pours
a
mellow
gold
with
a
half
inch
head
that
quickly
vanished
clean
grainy
aroma
fresh
mild
malty
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
zing
of
hops
in
the
back
very
much
a
summer
quencher
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
backyard
barbecue
my
macro
loving
son
in
law
loved
it
so
it
could
be
a
good
transitional
beer
d
low
abv
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
interesting
or
too
terribly
tasty
buying
it
drinkability
here
is
high
for
sure
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
put
quite
a
few
of
these
down
its
style
is
listed
as
an
epa
but
has
some
characteristics
of
a
wheat
beer
as
well
the
citrus
overall
very
crisp
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
so
it
fulfills
its
purpose
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
not
one
i
will
likely
be
seeking
out
again
still
was
nice
to
try
there
are
just
better
options
out
there
as
far
as
summer
beers
go
overall
not
a
bad
summer
offering
from
brooklyn
and
very
drinkable
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
as
it
really
does
not
bring
anything
new
to
the
summer
seasonable
table
a
summer
ale
that
isnt
a
pale
wheat
ale
or
fruit
beer
unbelievable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
must
say
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
now
pours
a
nice
pale
golden
color
small
head
to
it
not
much
for
lacing
or
bubbles
can
smell
the
nice
hops
and
malts
as
youre
pouring
it
excellent
this
is
a
very
crisp
refreshing
beer
very
well
balanced
and
nice
solid
mouthfeel
with
a
light
body
perfect
on
a
hot
day
one
of
the
more
thirst
quenching
beers
ive
tried
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
nothing
too
special
but
just
a
solid
beer
the
flavors
are
delightful
breadiness
with
a
buttery
diacytle
sp
if
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
summer
ale
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
one
drinkability
i
personally
just
didnt
love
this
beer
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
definitely
has
times
when
it
would
be
a
great
beer
think
hot
summer
days
and
barbecuing
but
overall
its
just
a
simpler
kinda
beer
also
the
carbonation
was
a
little
high
fo
me
to
give
it
huge
points
in
drinkability
this
is
kind
of
an
american
blonde
ale
and
english
pale
ale
hybrid
so
thats
how
i
reviewed
it
maybe
i
am
drinking
this
at
the
wrong
time
its
a
somewhat
cold
rainy
night
and
i
think
i
would
appreciate
this
one
more
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
heat
wave
i
have
to
say
i
was
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
right
here
maybe
the
english
pale
ale
isnt
my
style
but
there
was
not
much
i
liked
about
this
guy
right
here
this
tastes
like
it
could
be
just
about
any
semilight
beer
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
that
stands
out
it
tastes
like
an
old
bottle
of
acme
pale
ale
i
drank
a
while
back
i
will
finish
the
glass
but
i
will
need
something
to
wash
it
down
with
for
sure
drinkability
very
high
its
super
light
and
refreshing
summer
calls
for
a
summer
ale
brooklyns
version
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
white
foam
with
nice
retention
clean
malt
aromas
with
some
citrus
hops
compose
the
nose
bready
malt
is
complemented
by
some
citruslike
hoppiness
toward
the
finish
clean
crisp
and
definitely
refreshing
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
very
refreshing
d
a
tasty
ale
but
not
my
fave
in
brooklyns
lineup
it
is
a
good
pale
ale
and
appropriate
to
the
style
but
avererage
among
a
pack
of
pales
very
refreshing
summer
beer
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
nice
and
smoooth
prefect
for
a
summer
day
big
fan
of
other
brooklyn
brewery
offerings
brown
ale
lager
double
chocolate
stout
and
while
not
a
huge
fan
of
summer
ales
this
one
is
very
good
color
is
light
straw
w
a
foamy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
with
malt
overtones
taste
is
also
sweet
malty
slightly
fruity
but
not
overbearingly
so
very
enjoyable
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
evening
good
session
beer
looks
and
tastes
like
a
nice
english
pale
ale
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
fullers
esb
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
kinda
has
a
light
wheat
like
flavor
with
a
smattering
of
hops
palt
malts
help
to
round
this
out
into
a
solid
drink
really
doesnt
give
you
much
to
think
about
just
a
very
drinkable
slightly
bitter
ale
that
will
be
quite
enjoyable
for
these
hot
summer
louisiana
days
drinkability
this
is
ok
for
summer
ale
i
could
have
it
again
but
just
as
easily
pass
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
single
not
a
six
pack
very
drinkable
if
the
occasion
is
a
hot
day
with
no
breeze
it
does
say
summer
right
d
fairly
drinkable
simple
flavor
and
light
bodied
but
still
good
a
nice
summer
seasonal
for
sure
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
warm
evening
in
cincinnati
clear
golden
orange
with
a
small
creamy
head
pale
bready
malt
aroma
biscuity
with
citrus
lemon
zest
and
floral
hops
bread
and
flowers
upfront
in
the
flavor
some
dried
fruit
and
citrus
zestiness
mild
sweetness
and
an
almost
spiced
quality
crisp
clean
medium
light
a
good
take
on
a
summer
seaonal
i
can
dig
the
british
angle
light
and
refreshing
yet
packed
full
of
flavor
nice
drinkability
this
is
a
crisp
brew
truly
refreshing
and
with
some
decent
palate
character
as
well
d
very
refreshing
its
probably
good
from
the
bottle
too
on
nice
warm
summer
days
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
take
on
a
summer
ale
grassy
hop
flavors
add
a
nice
crispness
to
the
heavy
bready
maltiness
plenty
of
carbonation
add
to
the
thirst
quenching
quality
of
this
beer
i
think
just
about
anyone
who
drinks
beer
can
appreciate
this
one
me
likey
not
worth
trying
unless
what
you
just
read
sounds
enticing
most
everything
ive
ever
had
from
this
brewery
has
been
crisp
classy
and
enjoyable
this
brew
was
no
letdown
poured
into
brooklyn
brewery
pint
glass
fitting
poured
a
light
amber
almost
golden
color
with
decent
clearity
and
a
white
foamy
head
that
settled
in
about
a
minute
notably
had
decent
lacing
smells
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
subtle
hint
of
the
malts
crisp
citrus
taste
hops
bear
a
small
but
noticable
presence
finishes
with
a
fresh
lemony
bite
and
traces
of
the
hops
persuading
a
moderately
dry
pellet
definately
smooth
and
drinkable
not
too
complex
light
body
and
good
carbonation
definately
a
good
addition
to
the
brooklyn
lineup
in
new
england
most
people
only
know
the
sam
adams
summer
ale
which
is
decent
but
i
think
this
summer
ale
offering
from
brooklyn
is
better
soft
fizzy
carbonation
add
to
the
experience
of
this
easy
drinking
beer
what
can
i
say
i
dig
this
brew
it
has
all
the
right
flavors
in
the
right
places
could
it
be
better
sure
but
i
sure
enjoy
it
the
way
it
is
this
is
another
nice
summer
quaffer
i
will
undoubtedly
be
keeping
this
stocked
in
the
fridge
during
these
upcoming
months
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
brew
that
has
a
unmistakenly
good
malt
profile
it
feels
bigger
then
it
is
yet
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
well
balanced
i
love
how
authentic
the
lemon
is
in
this
one
very
close
to
something
directly
infused
into
the
beer
a
very
good
offering
for
the
summer
by
brooklyn
overall
its
not
an
especially
complex
beer
but
it
fits
the
bill
of
a
summer
ale
very
well
maybe
im
just
biased
but
i
cant
find
a
brooklyn
brewery
beer
i
dont
like
verdict
summer
ale
is
a
solid
enough
mild
beer
that
works
as
a
great
warmweather
alternative
to
all
of
the
lagers
and
wheat
beers
out
there
its
not
the
most
complex
or
interesting
beer
out
there
but
its
not
meant
to
be
certainly
worth
a
try
d
really
refreshing
it
seems
like
this
beer
is
true
to
its
style
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
breadybuttery
epa
character
but
even
as
a
fruit
fly
fell
into
the
beer
i
pulled
it
out
and
finished
it
brooklyn
summer
ale
is
a
very
clear
light
golden
ale
with
a
thin
white
ring
of
a
head
it
has
a
fruity
wooden
hop
aroma
with
a
note
of
lemon
it
is
light
fluffy
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
boozy
taste
its
lightly
bitter
with
notes
of
lemon
and
light
grain
it
seems
a
little
strong
for
a
summer
ale
definate
taste
of
lemon
in
the
ale
goes
down
very
smooth
a
refreshing
ale
definately
worthy
of
the
name

for
us
in
louisiana
perfect
with
some
spicy
boiled
crawfish

is
a
very
sessionable

would
be
great
on

beach
beer
d
now
this
is
what
i
call
refreshing
very
clean
and
crisp
and
doesnt
taste
like
corn
the
kind
of
beer
i
crave
after
a
4
mile
run
d
excellent
really
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
d
not
a
bad
beer
its
a
good
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
worth
trying
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
especially
now
that
the
weather
is
getting
warmer
great
beer
for
sitting
on
the
porch
and
enjoying
the
day
not
a
complex
beer
but
quite
quaffable
a
good
session
beer
and
one
of
the
better
brooklyn
beers
ive
had
had
this
on
tap
at
the
houston
flying
saucer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
looking
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
wonderful
aromas
of
honey
light
citrus
and
malts
very
easy
to
drink
with
more
honey
and
citrus
in
the
taste
with
high
carbonation
a
nice
crispy
sweet
finish
perfect
summer
beer
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
sam
adams
summer
ale
will
definately
try
again
d
drinkable
but
this
is
definitely
not
the
first
beer
that
i
would
look
for
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
a
somewhat
pedestrian
offering
from
brooklyn
although
it
does
earn
high
marks
for
refreshment
and
drinkability
ill
be
taking
a
closer
look
at
some
brooklyn
beers
soon
but
i
cant
say
i
understand
the
hype
currently
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
refreshing
beer
without
the
high
alcohol
level
of
most
craft
beer
d
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ale
but
this
was
a
tasty
easy
to
drink
brew
the
taste
is
quite
mild
there
is
a
nice
balance
some
bready
malts
some
hops
balance
things
out
maybe
a
touch
drying
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
an
ever
so
slight
citrus
taste
a
little
bit
honeyed
as
well
the
beer
is
more
smooth
than
pricklish
but
this
is
not
an
entirely
smooth
beer
either
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
little
tangy
bite
towards
the
finish
that
keeps
this
from
being
too
mild
an
experience
it
is
a
respectable
well
balanced
pale
ale
light
refreshing
plenty
carbonated
slight
mouthfeel
not
much
aftertaste
mouthfeel
very
very
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
pretty
good
allaround
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
poundable
beer
that
seems
to
fit
its
role
as
a
summer
beer
quite
well
even
though
there
are
other
of
its
kind
that
i
would
pick
first

out
of
a
summer
08
bottle
this
beer
was
a
bright
lemon
yellow
color
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
rising
in
it
the
head
was
offwhite
retained
fairly
well
and
left
curtains
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
light
floral
hops
and
wet
wheat
the
flavors
were
similar
but
unimpressive
bready
and
biscuity
malt
the
understated
hops
and
a
wheat
finish
that
was
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
due
to
overcarbonation
and
a
mediumlight
body
not
as
refreshing
as
i
hoped
from
a
summer
offering
had
this
at
mccarren
park
during
an
armin
van
buuren
concert
brooklyn
brewery
was
there
to
provide
beer
light
golden
pour
with
a
thin
head
not
a
strong
aroma
relatively
weak
taste
that
fits
the
lack
of
aroma
not
a
very
flavorful
beer
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
their
vienna
lager
is
far
better
a
good
beer
to
try
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
ill
have
one
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
though
overall
this
is
a
decent
refreshing
summer
ale
something
very
sessionable
to
be
consumed
while
mowing
the
lawn
perhahps
but
nothing
special
beyond
that
i
like
the
grainy
nose
but
this
beer
lacks
any
complexity
beyond
that
the
color
is
a
little
on
the
light
sight
reminds
of
a
cheap
bmc
lager

is
d

not

its

into

light

taste
is

with

well
as

brew
liked
this
brew
and
could
drink
a
few
and
would
drink
again
d
a
good
summer
ale
that
i
found
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
wheat
beers
that
are
out
now
drinkabilty
exactly
as
billed
this
is
a
crisp
and
easy
drinking
summer
beer
more
acidic
than
i
would
have
thought
lightbodied
but
with
a
little
creaminess
a
good
light
summery
beer
rather
weak
but
good
unobtrusive
flavor
color
is
a
very
golden
light
amber
hue
good
two
finger
head
after
the
pour
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
strong
film
of
foam
the
aroma
makes
me
thin
k
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
light
fruit
notes
with
some
adjuncty
corn
goodness
but
there
are
some
flower
hop
aroms
in
this
beer
as
well
the
taste
has
bready
malt
with
a
light
note
of
bananas
and
corn
bitter
yet
sessionable
aftertaste
of
flower
vines
the
palate
is
crisp
and
starchy
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
a
bitter
pale
wheat
ale
than
an
english
pale
ale
pretty
refreshing
beer
although
i
might
not
care
for
the
flavors
and
the
categorization
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
it
makes
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
d
though
this
isnt
the
best
summer
offering
ive
had
or
even
all
that
well
balanced
muted
malt
presence
i
still
cant
help
but
sip
on
this
repeatedly
the
extremely
complex
spice
note
from
mid
to
late
palate
is
addictive
and
engaging
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
this
before
the
season
is
out
12oz

honey
and
wheat
malt
almost
american
hefe
like
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
with
honey
citrus
and
slightly
bready
nice
hop
aftertaste
and
a
odd
although
nice
sweetness
slightly
sprtizy
perhaps
a
bit
too
rich
for
a
great
summer
beer
but
a
good
one
none
the
less
give
one
a
try
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
definately
recommend
this
for
a
session
beer
pours
golden
with
a
tightly
beaded
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
in
relatively
short
order
smells
of
clean
tangy
malt
with
some
fresh
grainy
smells
the
taste
is
similar
the
grain
is
even
more
pronounced
the
tanginess
less
so
clean
but
with
a
decent
body
and
depth
of
flavor
its
fairly
light
of
course
but
there
are
some
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
to
add
a
little
interest
nicely
balanced
light
and
tangy
so
this
drinks
well
in
the
summer
still
i
could
use
some
more
flavor
to
sustain
my
interest
not
my
favorite
style
but
pretty
well
done
this
would
be
a
fine
session
ale
for
any
season
the
bottle
states
5
0

which
is
ideal
for
a
long
evening
a
very
nice
change
from
the
ubiquitous

maybe
a

an

the

not

what

for

it

kind
of
wheat
ale
like
hints

and
a
dry

refreshing
with
a
dry
aftertaste
kind
of
a
standard
summer

not

refreshing
and
non

very
pale

biscuity
and

tastes
a

with

however
slight
finally
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
a
decent
summer
beer
kind
of
lackluster
but
still
a
bit
unique
id
gladly
drink
it
again
next
summer
though
i
might
not
buy
it
over
some
of
the
other
mainstays
d
a
very
drinkable
offering
from
brooklyn
as
i
find
many
of
their
beers
to
be
compared
to
other
summer
ales
this
has
a
unique
hop
profile
and
a
bit
more
interesting
character
than
others
good
drinkability
not
a
standout
but
nothing
radical
enough
to
mar
its
drinkability
bright
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
bubbles
that
quickly
falls
away
to
a
tiny
collar
biscuity
slightly
sweet
malts
make
for
a
pleasant
nose
while
the
hops
that
are
so
prominent
in
the
taste
are
pretty
muted
a
grassy
note
is
present
in
the
smell
too
as
mentioned
hop
bitterness
has
a
strong
presence
especially
in
the
finish
the
malts
arent
particularly
complex
but
theyre
nonetheless
tasty
some
ripe
fruit
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
smoother
and
cleaner
than
i
expect
given
that
level
of
hops
but
doesnt
cross
the
line
into
being
watery
this
isnt
a
standout
but
fares
quite
well
as
a
different
sort
of
summer
ale
this
is
a
very
average
beer
but
i
respect
where
brooklyn
was
headed
the
use
of
all
barley
instead
of
all
kinds
of
adjuncts
yields
a
tasty
brew
thats
just
as
drinkable
as
a
bud
but
much
tastier
which
is
ironic
because
its
a
simpler
list
of
ingredients
i
think
this
could
get
bmc
drinkers
to
give
craft
beer
a
chance
a
light
body
light
effervescence
with
nothing
but
hops
after
the
swalllow
sadly
nothing
to
make
me
want
to
have
this
again
for
a
maltmouth
like
me
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
nice
malty
aromas
fullbodied
taste
and
a
nottoothin
mouthfeel
make
this
a
nice
summer
brew
pours
a
clear
17k
gold
hue
with
a
frothy
three
and
a
half
finger
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
fine
patches
of
lace
toasty
victory
malt
light
crystal
and
buscuit
aromas
are
prevelant
along
with
marris
otter
and
a
touch
of
roasted
barley
a
hint
of
butterscotch
in
the
aroma
accompanied
by
a
fragrant
ekg
herbal
hop
scent
first
sip
if
full
of
sweet
marris
otter
and
delicate
tworow
with
a
strong
toasted
note
and
mild
caramel
backing
it
up
the
aftertaste
starts
out
hoppy
like
soft
fuggles
and
herbal
ekg
then
a
slightly
spicy
tettnanger
or
hallertau
flavor
brings
the
taste
into
perfect
balance
and
level
bitterness
a
suggestion
of
diacetyl
and
fruity
english
ale
character
slowly
becomes
more
apparent
and
pairs
with
the
medium
carbonatiion
and
light
body
to
achive
a
mouthfeel
that
is
both
lively
and
complex
but
also
noncloying
and
lusciously
smooth
the
finish
is
malty
but
not
residual
and
the
hop
tones
fade
away
gradually
with
the
mineral
character
the
drinkability
is
simply
phenomenal
and
this
beer
is
a
testament
to
the
lower
abv
styles
that
are
just
as
satisfying
as
the
modernday
double
and
imperial
ales
of
great
strength
drinkability
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
makes
for
fine
summertime
drinking
d
incredibly
drinkable
i
had
this
as
a
night
cap
but
i
can
see
it
working
wonders
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
i
cant
wait
to
pair
this
with
a
burger
off
the
grill
dthis
is
a
great
session
summer
beer
and
different
than
traditional
summer
offerings
refreshing
would
definitely
be
my
word
for
it
if
you
are
expecting
an
american
pale
you
will
be
dissapointed
but
if
you
arent
expecting
that
you
will
be
pleased
i
will
be
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
overall
this
beer
is
poundable
its
not
a
world
class
beer
by
any
means
but
take
it
for
what
it
is
an
easy
drinking
good
tasting
beer
you
could
line
these
up
down
the
bar
and
keep
them
coming
i
wont
fill
my
refrigerator
with
them
but
its
a
good
tasting
nice
drinking
beer
i
could
see
why
others
would
love
it
the
beer
is
solid
but
would
probably
be
better
with
food
d
certainly
easy
another
pleasant
beer

brooklyn
12

a
golden
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
very
good
it
smells
like
grassy
hops
grain
and

along
with
an
earthy
aroma
it
tastes
like
grain
sweet
malt
grapefruit
and
grassyearthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
good
its
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
as
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
good
and
sessionable
but
even
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
look
at
brooklyns
summer
ale
as
an
englishstyle
summer
ale
its
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
although
most
examples
from
the
uk
offer
a
tad
bit
more
hops
in
at
least
the
flavor
the
maltiness
is
quite
distinct
however
hitting
you
squarely
in
the
nose
aromawise
and
then
following
in
the
flavor
its
strawlike
grassy
and
a
touch
earthy
and
the
hops
that
follow
are
very
much
the
same
to
guess
id
imagine
theres
some
maris
otter
mixed
with
a
nonfloor
malted
base
and
fuggles
with
a
bit
of
goldings
thrown
in
theres
a
mild
bit
of
fruitiness
to
it
but
its
really
just
about
the
rounded
malt
and
hop
profile
its
not
complex
but
its
not
intended
to
be
its
lighter
than
a
pale
ale
well
at
least
less
bitter
and
basically
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
thats
got
some
nice
flavor
to
it
pours
a
crisp
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
earthy
hops
with
some
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
very
decent
balance
of
earthy
citrus
hops
and
sweet
malts
its
just
nothing
all
that
spectacular
or
overpowering
the
beer
is
light
to
slightly
medium
bodied
with
a
very
slight
heaviness
to
it
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
must
admit
im
partial
to
american
style
over
english
styles
any
day
of
the
week
had
a
couple
of
these
on
back
deck
while
grilling
some
food
up
nice
easy
drinking
summer
brew
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
revealed
a
nice
dark
golden
yellow
body
topped
with
a
white
foamy
2
finger
head
after
a
couple
minutes
the
head
settled
down
and
after
several
sips
there
was
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
somewhat
faint
at
first
but
after
digging
in
i
could
detect
wheat
malt
and
some
very
mild
fruitiness
a
nice
aroma
this
ale
tasted
really
good
its
got
little
bite
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
tangy
hops
and
a
tasty
malty
flavor
along
with
a
wheat
backbone
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crispits
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
mild
dry
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
really
good
summer
brew
for
the
summer
months
very
sessionable
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
carbonation
is
very
good
very
very
drinkable
i
could
session
this
overall
its
good
ill
drink
it
again
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
clean
pale
malt
and
wheat
scent
thats
refreshing
there
is
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
present
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
clean
crisp
wheat
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
refreshes
this
is
a
simple
brew
thats
quite
tastey
and
easy
drinking
especially
during
the
summer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
isnt
my
favorite
brooklyn
brew
but
its
very
drinkable
light
body
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
simple
and
easy
to
drink
especially
with
a
low
abv
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
seems
to
fit
well
in
the
summertime
mode
not
much
going
on
here
to
make
it
stand
out
too
bready
without
much
else
a
runofthemill
summer
wheat
beer
at
best
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
a
watery
feel
that
turns
me
off
still
its
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
caramel
malt
profile
and
light
cascadelike
hops
so
for
a
summer
ale
it
has
malt
and
hops
the
problem
is
just
that
there
isnt
quite
enough
of
each
i
feel
like
this
might
be
better
enjoyed
outside
in
the
heat
but
inside
it
comes
off

malty
wheat
there
was
a
subtle
musty
flavor
along
with
some
notes
of
citrus
and
pine
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
overall
its
not
the
best
seasonal
brooklyn
but
its
still
worth
a
try
this
brew
poured
to
a
dark
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
white
head
that
had
good
retention
and
did
leave
a
little
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
while
possessing
some
wheat
like
characteristics
seem
to
have
a
pretty
good
amount
of
hop
scent
the
flavors
have
a
number
of
noticeable
things
wheat
flavor
toasted
flavors
some
citrus
and
a
lasting
but
mellow
hop
flavor
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
i
really
wonder
if
they
are
trying
this
one
to
be
similar
to
hop
sun
from
southern
tier
it
is
a
ok
beer
a
good
one
for
the
summer
months
but
really
does
not
seem
overly
interesting
i
would
get
it
again
but
do
feel
that
it
is
one
of
brooklyns
more
basic
choices
it
seems
more
and
more
that
summer
ales
are
just
too
light
for
a
good
session
beer
i
think
theyre
trying
to
market
these
beers
to
people
who
really
dont
like
flavorful
full
bodied
beers
it
seems
that
brewers
are
adding
citrus
taste
to
mild
tasting
beers
to
sell
these
oh
well
for
a
summer
style
ale
this
is
quite
quenching
without
compromising
any
of
its
flavour
brooklyn
brewery
seems
to
offer
a
good
product
easy
to
drink
summer
time
fun
in
a
bottle
i
prefer
brooklyns
pilsner
when
the
weather
is
hot
but
this
will
do
just
fine
skeptically
picked
up
a
6pack
at
greensmidtown
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
goldenstraw
colored
ale
was
topped
by
a
nice
fizzy
fluffy
white
head
the
head
slowly
dissipates
after
a
few
sips
smell
of
faint
wheat
malt
with
a
slight
whiff
of
cucumber
tastes
like
a
well
balanced
hybrid
of
an
american
pale
ale
and
a
wheat
ale
with
a
zesty
slightly
fruity
finish
an
excellent
summer
beer
in
my
book
and
i
could
easily
have
5
more
pours
a
slightly
hazy
ambercopper
color
with
an
inch
of
white
head
on
top
looks
pretty
solid
nose
is
quite
mild
hints
of
wheat
and
some
citrus
fruit
some
saltiness
maybe
a
little
astringent
up
front
i
could
do
with
a
little
more
malt
presence
or
stronger
lemon
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
its
a
fairly
subtle
flavor
even
to
the
point
of
blandness
feel
is
a
little
thin
bodied
overall
this
ones
alright
although
there
are
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
crisp
and
refreshing
at
the
opening
of
the
sip
and
not
nearly
as
bubbly
as
i
feared
late
breaking
wheat
taste
is
easy
on
the
palate
recovers
nicely
from
a
substandard
outward
measure
definitely
could
be
consumed
in
quantity
in
the
summer
months
particularly
outside
worthy
of
the
brooklyn
moniker
light
golden
body
with
lots
of
bubbly
carbonation
the
smell
is
strong
in
the
grassy
grains
over
a
light
texture
of
wheat
similar
to
a
classic
pilsener
light
in
the
mouth
and
quite
easy
drinking
with
a
sharp
bite
of
carbonation
and
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
very
different
from
your
stereotypical
summer
ale
by
staying
away
from
the
citrusy
fruits
that
we
are
accustomed
to
not
bad
just
not
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
d
definately
a
session
beer
12oz
bottle
from
lous
in
augusta
light
amber
almost
yellow
body
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
citrusy
hops
and
caramel
malt
equally
share
the
aroma
though
its
not
overpowering
biscuit
malt
plays
a
big
role
with
some
citrus
hops
in
the
background
along
with
hints
of
a
mintlike
quality
again
not
overpowering
light
in
body
making
this
very
drinkable
all
around
enjoyable
light
summer
beer
though
having
enough
good
flavor
and
aroma
to
satisfy
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
ive
had
mouthfeeldrinkability
extremely
puffy
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
disappointing
and
unlike
any
other
offering
i
can
recall
from
bb
eeeh
its
beer
a
blond
alte
style
that
is
basically
dull
and
problematic
that
is
modestly
improved
by
a
slight
wheat
addition
curious
as
to
why
a
brewery
the
caliber
such
as
brookly
would
even
bother
the
beer
pours
a
brightly
colored
straw
with
active
carbonation
that
is
held
below
7up
status
by
the
wheat
texture
smells
half
malty
half
grainy
and
with
a
light
lemongass
note
the
flavors
closely
mimic
the
aromas
with
emphasis
on
the
light
malts
the
feel
is
light
and
kept
from
watery
by
the
wheat
additions
fairly
clean
and
crisp
in
the
finish
with
a
light
grainhust
astringecy
and
hoppiness
its
a
fine
hotweather
brew
but
does
not
inspire
any
deep
thoughts
or
contemplation
eric
pours
a
clean
clear
amber
color
with
a
twofinger
head
which
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
floral
but
biscuity
at
the
same
time
no
citrus
but
some
faint
light
fruit
scents
a
subtle
earthy
feel
to
it
all
around
the
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
distinct
wheat
beer
notes
some
yeasty
character
as
well
with
a
decent
hop
balance
im
not
sure
of
the
abv
here
but
theres
a
slight
alcohol
pang
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
could
do
without
but
for
the
most
part
its
a
very
tasty
beer
not
too
complex
but
to
the
point
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
an
entirely
drinkable
beer
and
true
to
its
name
this
is
a
great
summertime
session
beer
just
dont
go
in
with
super
high
expectations
and
youll
be
relatively
pleased
nothing
earth
shattering
about
this
beer
but
for
something
i
can
get
at
the
bodega
at
the
end
of
my
block
its
pretty
awesome
great
for
just
kicking
back
on
a
lazy
hot
night
notes
i
had
it
with
grilled
teriyaki
shrimp
skewers
with
pineapple
over
a
mesclun
greens
salad
and
it
was
a
decent
match
for
such
a
light
meal
not
a
terribly
interesting
brew
as
far
as
taste
or
nose
goes
but
as
a
light
easy
drinking
summer
ale
it
fits
the
bill
on
tap
at
mammosers
in
hamburgny
poured
from
the
tap
a
dull
light
to
medium
golden
a
thin
white
head
sat
atop
not
much
retention
to
itlight
toasted
grain
aromas
with
a
faint
citrus
note
but
its
really
faint
crisp
and
dry
toasted
cereal
grainlike
flavors
with
a
mild
citric
quality
showing
thru
in
the
finish
kinda
boring
to
another
run
of
the
mill
summer
ale
i
suppose
overall
just
a
plain
non
exciting
brew
that
isnt
quite
an
american
wheat
but
doesnt
fit
anywhere
else
a
little
below
average
wont
go
back
brewed
and
bottled
in
utica
first
saw
this
last
year
at
croxleys
ale
house
on
long
island
as
a
draftonly
beer
the
bartender
did
not
know
much
about
the
beer
except
that
it
was
called
a
summer
ale
i
did
not
review
it
then
as
it
was
dark
in
the
bar
and
i
had
been
drinking
other
beers
beforehand
this
is
basically
brooklyns
light
dinner

put

pours
a
clear
bright
gold
with
a
nice

the
english
malt
gives
it
a
faint
bready
smell
and
flavor
at
4
5
abv
it
is
an
easy
drinking
lightbodied
beer
the
flavor
will
not
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
does
finish
with
a
clean
crisp
lemonycitrus
bitterness
that
reminds
you
are
not
drinking
a
macro
lager
not
meant
for
the
beergeek
crowd
by
any
means
but
it
should
make
its
way
into
some
coolers
during
the
warm
summer
months
actually
quite
crisp
and
clean
again
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
pours
transparent
yellow
with
almost
no
head
looks
much
like
a
maco
lager
i
could
barely
pick
up
a
malt
smell
to
it
but
i
guess
it
was
there
the
taste
is
pretty
average
sweet
carmel
malt
and
it
finishes
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
weight
body
somewhat
watery
and
goes
down
smooth
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
i
bet
it
would
be
a
great
transition
beer
for
the
bmc
drinker
since
they
are
so
similar
yes
this
is
a
summer
type
of
beer
yes
it
is
light
and
drinkable
other
than
that
i
cant
say
much
about
it
i
hate
to
say
it
but
its
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
from
brooklyn
usually
they
produce
some
great
brews
this
one
just
doesnt
impress
i
know
the
label
says
ale
and
ba
says
american
pale
wheat
but
i
swear
that
if
i
tasted
this
blind
that
id
guess
it
was
a
continental
lager
and
a
mediocre
one
at
best
the
one
thing
that
this
beer
does
well
is
it
will
appeal
to
many
of
the
uninitiated
and
welcome
them
to
the
world
of
good
beer
and
great
brooklyn
products
other
than
that
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
12
oz

was

most
noticeably

here
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
sessionable
brew
with
the

this
one
lacks
character
and
distinction

is

taste
is

up

a

finish
this
beer
was
disappointing
averagebut
just
barley
i
would
not
drink
it
again
d
good
session
beer
not
much
seperating
it
from
the
other
summers
ive
had
a
lot
less
phenolic
than
the
saranac
the
lower
abv
fits
the
busy
summer
season
on
the
go
this
beer
wont
way
you
down
it
does
the
quenching
thing
after
a
mow
and
even
the
macrofriends
will
handle
and
like
this
brew
yet
another
americal
pale
wheat
that
dares
to
be
unoriginal
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
doesnt
even
begin
to
challenge
the
palate
this
is
one
of
those
wideopen
styles
that
seems
to
invite
if
not
embrace
varied
interpretations
yet
many
still
brew
these
plain
renditions
this
particular
beer
is
well
crafted
but
thoroughly
uninspired
as
are
many
in
the
style
i
was
not
expecting
a
light
style
beer
at
all
the
brooklyn
summer
ale
tasted
a
lot
lighter
than
sam
adams
summer
ale
with
a
little
more
clean
water
and
no
perceptible
hint
of
alcohol
this
beer
would
be
good
for
lounging
around
while
watching
the
dallas
cowboys
trying
to
play
tough
with
the
phili
eagles
like
i
did
today
with
a
roast
beef

first
i
have

had
this

they
were
almost
exactly
the
same
color
a
nice
dark
amber
it
was
decidedly
hoppy
but
still
had
a
good
balance
the
hops
were
of
the
earthy
spicy
variety
not
fruity
or
piney
like
a
typical
american
ipa
the
beer
was
very
smooth
i
kept
liking
it
better
as
the

neared

either

i
was
glad
to
try
it
tastefeel
i
was
expecting
a
rating
of
about
84
for
this
beer
but
was
surprised
at
the
76
this
is
my
first
beer
from
arcadia
and
i
like
it
a
lot
being
a
pale
ale
its
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
but
its
insanely
drinkable
has
a
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
the
finish
is
clean
a
refreshing
english
pale
ale
that
id
love
to
have
again
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
of
the
style
seems
that
im
the
minority
as
a
lot
of
people
dont
care
for
it
that
much
maybe
i
got
a
fresh
keg
i
dig
it
pours
a
murky
gold
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
with
steadily
rising
carbonation
bubbles
there
were
also
some
odd
floaters
in
the
glass
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
definitely
a
clean
looking
beer
smells
a
lot
like
a
wheat
ale
only
leaving
odd
the
additional
lemon
scent
i
also
smell
some
mild
grains
and
very
light
malt
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
tastes
predominantly
of
very
smooth
wheat
along
with
a
very
very
light
malt
definitely
an
easy
drinker
the
mouthfeel
pretty
much
remains
the
same
except
it
allows
some
very
slight
fruityness
to
come
through
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
probably
the
best
palewheat
ale
that
i
have
had
to
date
this
one
looks
nice
on
the
pour
but
its
all
downhill
from
there
flavor
profile
shows
more
nut
tones
than
the
hops
that
id
be
expecting
there
are
some
minor
citrus
characteristics
but
it
all
just
seems
to
be
missing
the
mark
might
be
interesting
on
cask
but
it
certainly
isnt
all
that
interesting
off
the
bottle
very
light
and
crisp
feel
that
tingles
on
the
tongue
with
little
to
no
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
grainy
aftertaste
thats
slightly
bitter
a
hint
of
lemon
lingers
after
each
swallow
as
it
did
in
the
nose
after
each
whiff
a
nice
enjoyable
pale
ale
that
goes
down
smooth
easy
and
was
enjoyable
i
recall
having
this
ale
from
the
bottle
several
years
ago
and
enjoying
it
assuming
the
tap
was
clean
perhaps
my
taste
has
changed
or
the
ales
recipe
changed
either
way
i
was
disappointed
and
did
not
request
another
overall
bland
but
an
extremely
easy
drink
chalky
palate
with
muted
toasted
caramel
and
crystal
malts
yeasty
chalky
fruit
that
is
more
muted
than
the
malt
the
palate
finishes
thin
but
with
good
subtle
earthy
natural
hopping
o
decent
beer
quite
enjoyable
most
english
pale
ales
are
a
bit
more
laid
back
than
this
one
will
have
to
visit
this
fishing
hole
again
sometime
this
beer
pours
a
bright
orange
copper
color
it
has
a
nice
2finger
offwhite
head
on
it
the
head
has
pretty
good

it
leaves
some
scattered
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
nice
bit
of
floral
hops
and
some
caramel
sweetness
there
are
also
some
aromas
of
lemony
citrus
and
a
bit
of
yeastiness
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
it
starts
out
with
some
bready
malts
and
a
decent
hop
presence
there
are
some
other
flavors
of
caramel
and
fruit
some
lemony
citrus
is
on
the
back
end
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
caramel
malt
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
this
has
a
medium
body
and
average
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
it
is
pretty
refreshing
there
is
a
good
amount
of
a
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
the
drinkability
here
is
pretty
good
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
in
an
evening
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
but
it
could
use
more
hop
presence
not
the
best
but
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
o
since
this
is
from
a
brewery
that
has
put
out
some
other
decent
beers
im
inclined
to
give
them
the
botd
and
say
it
might
have
been
past
expiration
or
somesuch
but
i
probably
wont
ever
get
this
one
again
o
very
mild
but
smooth
and
sessionable
could
drink
about
50
of
these
taste
is
sharper
than
the
aroma
suggests
to
me
anyway
caramel
and
toffeeish
in
the
front
and
soft
throughout
somewhat
metallic
twang
introduces
the
hop
characteristics
these
arent
over
the
top
but
a
bit
more
american
in
that
the
florals
move
toward
the
citrus
side
pine
is
a
bit
more
aggressive
with
that
said
the
hops
are
not
dominant
the
malt
is
steady
all
the
way
through
and
keeps
the
beer
well
balanced
i
hope
i
never
tire
of
picking
up
random
singles
at
the
store
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
mostly
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
lemon
zest
lighter
grapefruit
peel
grass
light
caramel
and
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
the
grass
is
stronger
now
and
the
caramel
has
morphed
into
a
mild
lightly
biscuity
toffee
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
nothing
special
but
something
easily
drinkable
if
the
desire
is
there
the
extreme
carbonation
in
the
pour
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
coupled
with
the
restrained
taste
make
this
a
pretty
mediocre
offering
i
think
the
brewery
may
have
tweaked
the
beer
a
bit
the
label
has
been
updated
but
not
on
their
website
a
bit
more
hopforward
than
i
recall
on
first
trying
the
beer
some
time
ago
but
never
got
around
to
reviewing
a
bit
grassy
up
front
with
some
sharpness
quickly
fading
to
a
more
broad
malt
presence
finish
is
lasting
bitternes
struck
me
as
a
bit
hoppier
than
the
english
pale
ale
prototype
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
easy
going
down
there
is
a
nice
smooth
feel
that
makes
this
a
good
drinker
and
not
bad
to
have
paired
with
food
overall
this
is
my
2nd
time
having
this
pale
ale
and
thought
possibly
the
first
time
i
tried
it
was
an
old
batch
certainly
not
the
case
too
light
for
a
pale
ale
and
has
way
too
much
carbonation
of
course
it
could
be
sessional
and
drinkability
is
easy
but
i
will
never
go
back
to
this
one
again
glad
i
tried
again
though
a
serviceable
pale
ale
and
easy
drinking
enough
to
have
another
obtained
as
part
of
arcadia
ales
mixed
12
pack
a
recommendation
i
make
for
anyone
looking
to
have
a
mix
of
good
craft
beer
on
hand
for
friends
average
at
best
this
pours
medium
amber
with
a
nice
two
finger
highly
frothy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lace
on
the
nose
there
are
biscuit
malts
oats
wet
grass
and
dried
fruity
esters
in
the
mouth
the
hops
serve
more
for
the
slightly
bitter
maybe
a
little
tart
medium
finish
before
all
that
is
a
dry
malt
bill
toasted
biscuit
with
the
slightly
bitter
finish
more
tackedon
than
seamlessly
integrated
the
oat
note
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
kind
of
comes
across
like
a
pale
oatmeal
stout
which
is
sort
of
strange
but
it
works
this
is
a
strange
beer
and
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
i
lack
reference
points
for
english
pales
but
i
like
the
subdued
hop
presence
and
if
indeed
those
are
oats
that
i
was
getting
im
a
big
fan
of
that
too
pours
a
clear
copper
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
dry
hops
sweet
malt
slight
spice
floral
hops
slight
citrus
hops
and
a
hint
of
grain
fits
the
style
of
an
english
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
dry
hops
hint
of
honey
slight
sweet
malt
slight
grain
slight
pale
malt
and
slight
floral
hops
overall
better
aroma
than
body
great
appearance
but
still
lacking
as
an
english
pale
ale
on
the
take
home
scale
id
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
strong
yeast
bite
that
i
associate
with
a
homebrew
it
tastes
thin
although
the
body
is
moderate
the
flavor
picks
up
mildly
when
swallowed
where
the
hop
shows
up
its
rather
nondescript
very
light
not
much
going
on
all
of
the
flavors
are
a
little
too
subtle
ill
probably
pass
this
one
over
much
carbonation
this
beer
is
just
weak
the
hops
suck
and
the
only
thing
holding
it
together
is
the
caramel
malt
this
shouldnt
be
a
pale
ale
but
just
a
plain
ale
d
would
be
a
nice
summer
brew
very
nice
but
not
amazing
beer
pours
into
a
nice
orangeyellow
body
with
a
big
white
head
that
has
some
carbonation
good
retention
and
little
lacing
it
has
a
nice
floral
smell
with
some
apple
and
oranges
while
the
taste
is
of
some
apples
oranges
pears
some
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
malts
it
has
a
nice
creamy
buttery
mouth
feel
that
gives
it
have
good
drinkability
not
the
best
pale
ale
ive
tasted
but
not
too
bad
either
extremely
drinkable
took
down
a
sixer
with
ease
not
filling
and
goes
well
with
just
about
any
food
a
sleeper
for
sure
will
put
this
on
my
regular
rotation
d
flavours
dont
seem
to
jive
very
well
in
this
one
its
not
bad
but
not
great
either
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
decent
brew
its
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
maltiness
and
buttery
texture
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
theres
many
more
tastier
pale
ales
out
there
a
lowertier
pale
ale
at
best
the
mouth
is
smooth
with
low
carbonation
i
could
have
this
one
once
in
awhile
but
that
metallic
twang
would
limit
me
to
one
or
two
d
not
what
i
was
expwcting
an
ale
that
tasted
like
the
others
in
the
sampler
with
a
hop
differance
poured
out
a
honey
to
gold
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
and
not
much
lacing
smelled
on
the
weaker
side
typical
of
a
pale
with
a
mild
hop
and
burnt
malt
aroma
taste
was
what
i
expected
from
the
smell
with
malts
the
dominating
factor
and
a
slight
hoppy
bite
at
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
oily
drinkability
is
very
good
with
the
low
alchohol
content
and
i
cant
say
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
not
my
favorite
but
very
respectable
michigan
micro
brews
are
becoming
a
force
in
the
craft
brew
scene
and
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
drink
their
offerings
at
will
a
good
english
pale
ale
hop
character
is
much
more
pronounced
overshadowing
a
lot
of
the
malt
jonathan
passow
the
beer
pours
a
nice
goldenamber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
some
fruity
yeast
esters
its
dry
with
a
light
hop
presence
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
very
drinkable
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
with
a
mild
hop
character
and
a
fruity
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
pale
ale
its
easy
drinking
and
true
to
style
a
good
lighter
ale
which
works
great
with
food
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
to
it
the
smell
was
not
overpowering
but
smells
like
any
other
ale
taste
was
on
the
lighter
side
with
mild
bitterness
once
again
not
overpowering
but
not
tasteless
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
a
crisp
a
good
beer
if
you
want
to
have
several
and
a
great
beer
to
have
with
food
overall
a
pretty
normal
ale
cheers
overall
not
impressed
with
any
of
the
beer
that
came
in
the
mixed
twelve
pack
of
arcadia
that
i
purchased
it
all
kinda
had
the
same
taste
to
me
like
there
was
not
enough
yeast
in
it
to
ferment
all
the
sugars
pours
an
amber
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
some
mild
hops
and
something
i
cant
place
but
seems
off
taste
consists
of
a
slight
hop
flavor
with
a
plastic
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
watery
notes
probably
a
great
beer
for
the
ol
fishing
trip
or
a
weekend
with
the
guys
as
long
as
it
is
very
cold
the
thing
is
there
are
many
other
cheaper
options
that
would
fit
the
purpose
that
this
beer
serves
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
to
be
honest
i
would
try
something
else
out
if
given
the
chance
just
my
opinion
but
there
are
better
beers
to
be
had
in
the
style
i
would
drink
another
though
if
given
to
me
pours
a
golden
color
moving
to
orange
pretty
hazy
i
think
but
it
slowly
clears
up
with
a
nice
2cm
white
head
i
must
say
that
the
head
is
loose
and
it
sort
of
fell
down
and
only
left
a
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
very
raw
and
there
are
sort
of
3
elements
first
i
noticed
a
distinct
graininess
with
something
like
lemon
zest
on
top
of
it
then
theres
a
yeasty
smell
with
a
bit
of
a
fermentation
smell
as
if
it
was
actively
going
on
then
theres
an
airiness
to
it
a
real
lightness
to
the
whole
beer
the
taste
comes
first
with
this
slight
pale
maltiness
almost
like
its
mixed
with
lemonlime
soda
almost
some
artificial
read
unmalty
like
sucrose
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
all
of
the
normal
stuff
in
this
one
the
body
is
somewhere
around
mediumthin
and
the
carbonation
rushes
in
with
every
drink
almost
stinging
and
biting
lively
and
interesting
fairly
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
doubt
if
i
would
come
back
to
it
with
so
much
more
out
there
and
i
have
to
say
honestly
this
beer
fits
just
perfectly
as
an
average
beer
in
the
category
d
this
was
somehow
well
made
yet
it
fell
flat
for
me
i
think
the
flavors
were
so
light
that
the
floral
note
seemed
out
of
place
all
in
all
a
decent
pale
ale
but
not
one
i
would
especially
seek
out
again
this
beer
is
appetizing
light
and
flavorful
a
good
session
beer
this
one
came
out
of
arcadias
mixed
12
pack
this
is
the
first
of
the
four
to
review
pours
a
hazy
orange
copper
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
about
half
the
size
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
orange
and
honey
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
crisp
hoppy
flavor
followed
by
sweet
honey
and
orange
flavors
the
mouthfeel
has
a
mediium
body
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
could
easily
throw
back
two
or
three
of
these
moreys
bottom
line
taste
like
a
homebrewed
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
a
well
done
one
but
not
good
enough
to
be
satisfied
with
for
a
decent
brewery
overall
not
enjoyable
verging
on
slightly
unpleasant
and
not
as
good
as
other
pale
ales
ive
had
poorest
of
the
lot
from
the
brewery
sampler
still
a
fair
beer
though
try
it
a
nice
session
beer
for
sure
d
no
thank
you
hopefully
this
was
a
bad
bottle
but
it
doesnt
really
have
that
noticeable
skunked
aroma
and
flavor
not
good
drinkability
decent
beer
worth
a
shot
not
my
favorite
apa
by
a
long
shot
the
anglers
ale
was
my
least
favorite
of
arcadias
12pack
however
it
is
worth
a
try
d
not
bad
seems
rather
thirst
quenching
it
lacks
complexity
and
the
malt
flavors
are
pretty
bland
the
lemony
citrus
was
interesting
and
enjoyable
pours
dark
goldento
slight
orange
and
is
a
bit
cloudy
i
found
everything
about
this
beer
to
be
very
subtleand
balanced
nice
sweet
earthy
maltyhoppy
tones
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
not
alot
to
say
just
a
damn
good
drinkable
glass
of
ale
an
inauspicious
start
and
the
flavour
profile
was
not
too
promising
either
after
warming
for
a
while
though
it
began
to
come
into
itself
tastewise
i
was
vividly
reminded
of
your
english
bitter
fairly
mild
in
flavor
dry
bitterness
nice
citrus
tartness
notes
from
122505
drinkability
im
certainly
disappointed
as
i
can
taste
a
decent
beer
hiding
in
there
somewhere
per
the
notch
best
purchased
before
february
hmm
its
still
september
i
did
my
part
dthis
just
tasted
way
off
doesnt
really
resemble
an
apa
at
all
this
may
just
simply
be
a
bad
batch
but
i
dont
get
a
sense
that
the
base
is
close
to
the
style
it
says
it
is
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
good
sized
head
it
smells
of
mild
hops
malt
and
caramel
im
really
having
trouble
putting
the
taste
into
words
but
it
reminds
me
alot
of
bass
pale
ale
but
more
tart
im
not
sure
why
this
is
categorized
as
an
american
pale
ale
it
seems
much
more
along
the
lines
on
an
english
pale
ale
it
even
says
it
is
brewed
in
the
english
style
on
the
label
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
again
similar
to
bass
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
pours
a
highly
carbonated
clear
copper
color
with
a
huge
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
malt
light
floral
fruit
and
paper
the
flavor
is
masked
by
paper
although
minimal
amounts
of
fruit
floral
and
malt
manage
to
make
there
way
through
medium
bodied
oily
texture
finishes
very
metallic
a
very
nice
pale
offering
from
arcadia
for
sure
if
not
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
in
general
d
d
pretty
average
beer
here
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
flavor
is
as
the
nose
suggests
with
the
addition
of
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
fruitiness
pears
apples
it
starts
with
floral
and
grassy
hops
warms
to
reveal
its
fruitiness
and
sweet
caramel
malts
and
then
becomes
more
herbal
and
leafy
at
the
swallow
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
and
given
the
amount
of
rich
malt
present
it
can
seem
almost
sweetish
at
times
hops
linger
in
the
mouth
for
quite
some
time
backed
by
traces
of
malt
and
a
moderate
clinging
bitterness
nicely
done
definitely
an
interesting
sample
i
was
greatly
surprised
and
impressed
by
this
one
i
first
heard
about
it
last
fall
and
i
had
looked
it
up
and
their
own
website
made
it
sound
like
a
weak
light
beer
so
i
avoided
it
for
the
longest
time
however
i
gave
it
a
shot
recently
and
was
very
glad
i
did
it
reminded
me
of
a
strong
english
pale
very
similar
to
a
bass
it
had
some
mild
yet
distict
hops
but
also
a
solid
malt
finish
this
may
be
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
arcadia
odd
noncomplementary
tastes
with
a
ridiculously
fizzyovercarbonated
feel
not
good
the
taste
teeters
towards
the
sweeter
side
often
reminding
me
of
citrus
fruit
acidity
and
tingles
the
tongue
a
bit
but
not
enough
to
cause
any
positive
or
negative
reaction
its
not
a
hard
beer
to
drink
and
could
probably
bring
moderate
enjoyment
during
a
session
but
it
never
really
challenges
itself
to
be
anything
but
mediocre
very
cloudy

loaded

the

on

with
faint

and

mild

and

mostly
covered
up

definitely
an
interesting
brew
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into

poured
a

with
a
sizable
off
white
head
that
left
a
slight
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sweet
fruits
like
apples
with
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
almost
like
a
hoppy
dry
cider
interesting
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
but
honestly
thats
they
way
i
like
it
its
a
good
beer
not
great
but
solid
d
overall
just
an
average
table
ale
not
bad
overall
probably
slightly
above
average
could
use
some
work
in
terms
of
boosting
overall
flavour
but
no
real
complaints
anywhere
a
typical
pale
ale
for
the
most
part
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly

peachyorange
color
with
a
huge
frothy

smell
is
primarily
hops
slightly

and
pale

is
very

slightly
sweet
malty
background
complemented
nicely
with
a
slightly
spicy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
frothy
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
not
too
shabby
either
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
drank
good
could
drink
34
without
getting
too
bored
or
excited
hopheads
may
find
it
a
bit
tame
keeping
this
theme
the
finish
seemed
to
alternate
between
a
bitter
and
sweet
and
although
only
5

the
alcohol
seemed
to
work
itself
in
at
the

as

the
taste
is
malty
a
little
bit
hoppy
yeasty
with
some
caramel
this
does
not
remind
me
of
a
apa
at
all
really
medium
body
drinkable
this
brewery
is
disappointing
me
at
this
time
definitely
not
recommended
an
easy
to
drink
decent
apa
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
this
is
the
foamiest
beer
ive
ever
opened
it
didnt
surge
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
opened
it
but
the
gentlest
of
pours
down
the
side
of
a
pint
glass
gave
me
nothing
but
a
glass
of
foam
and
about
3mm
worth
of
beer
at
the
bottom
when
things
finally
settled
down
i
took
a
wiff
and
got
some
very
mild
hoppiness
and
some
nonhopgenerated
citrus
flavor
is
malty
watery
and
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
watery
i
cant
say
i
recommend
this
at
all
tasty
bottle
conditioned
brew
made
in
feb
d
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
limits
this
to
a
23
beer
max
drinkability
very
average
beer
here
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
apa
and
the
unbalanced
flavors
makes
you
want
to
look
for
a
different
beer
d
this
tasted
pretty
good
despite
how
it
was
overly
foamy
arcadia
has
better
offerings
pleasing
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
once
the
head
subsides
toasty
malt
sweetness
followed
by
strong
hop
bitterness
and
throat
warming
alcohol
hops
remain
on
tongue
for
several
minutes
drinkability
is
not
impressive
thanks
go
to

i
dont

how
many

i
have
purchased
that
were

of

this

was
probably
infected

it
was
on

selling
for

10
buckssix

this
is
becoming
a

problem
for
micros
either
they
intentionally
ship
defective

or
they
refuse
to
give
the

a

date
this
poured
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
a

head
that
looked
like
an
ice
cream
soda
the
head
was
fluffy
rocky
and
experienced
good
retention
throughout
it
had
a
light
slightly
malty
nose
and
its
color
was
a

the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
modestly
hoppy

this

to
go
out
and
dunk
some

arcadia

some
good

imperial
stout
is
outstanding
but
this
is
the
worst
of
those
that
ive
tried
so
far
with
no
real
flavor
focus
and
a
glaring
lack

it
isnt
anything
that
i
want
to
drink
again
when
he
should
have
been
back
at
the

working
out
the
kinks
in

this

you
could
get

out
searching
for
them
not
to
bad
of

head
is
absolutely
massive
about
3
atop
about
1
of

the
head
is
a
light

the
body
is
a
hazy
copper
color
with
lots
of
visible

bubbles
taste
is
bitter
like
an

should
be
but
doesnt
have
the
bouquet
floral
pine
or
citrus
of
many
a
pa
is
this
an
infected
bottle
it
seems
like
arcadia
would
be
a
big
enough
brewer
to
have
better
quality
control
but
this
beer
seems
lackluster

around

category

pale

esb
great
session
pint
not
a
big
complex
but
one
that
shows
in
crossing
waves
over
time
not
a
beer
that
takes
its
age
well
in
the
bottle
the
taste
is
excellent
several
different
fruits
are
exhibited
in
both
their
sweet
and
sour
phases
the
hops
are
noticable
as
well
and
very
welcomed
the
label
says
that
there
are
english
goldings
fuggles
and
williamette
hops
used
to
make
this
brew
im
not
familiar
with
any
of
that
lingo
but
damn
this
one
sure
does
taste
good
the
mouthfeel
probably
stretches
to
the
ranks
of
mediumbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
i
want
another
one
before
the
first
one
is
even
gone
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
im
sure
ill
be
picking
it
up
again
very
soon
cheers
while
its
several
shades
shy
of
spectacular
i
also
cant
really
find
fault
with
it
very
nice
easy
drinker
grab
one
for
a
mellow
session

frothy

nicely

mouthfeel
is
heftier
than
light
subdued
carbonation
gives
it
some
added
weight
overall
taste
comes
out
as
malty
caramel
and
some
of
the
butterscotch
that
influences
arcadia
ipa
too
much
better
tolerated
here
in
my
opinion
hops
are
nicely
evident
but
definitely
old
world
uk
style
flowery
and
bubblegum
slick
drinkable
with
some
refreshing
peach
qualities
going
on
here
and
not
so
jarring
as
the
buttery
ipa
from
the
same
brewer
to
my
mind
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
4
12
offwhite
head
over
1
of
cloudy
medium
amber
brew
and
that
was
with
a
gentle
pour
ok
after
much
ado
to
get
the
bottle
in
the
glass
lots
of
meringey
head
still
present
and
loads
of
pretty
foamy
lace
aroma
is
lightly
of
fruity
hops
taste
is
hops
bitterness
over
a
light
pale
maltiness
hmph
after
the
wait
was
expecting
something
more
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
and
even
after
expending
all
that
head
still
overcarbonated
drinkability
suffers
from
same
too
bad
this
ones
flavor
was
overpowered
by
the
presentation
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slight
creamy
aspect
fits
the
style
well
and
is
enjoyable
this
brew
is
definetly
easy
to
drink
however
it
lacks
anything
special
to
bring
me
back
part
of
the
mixed
12
pack
i
split
with
orbitalr0x
the
beer
pours
a
peachy
orange
color
with
a
small
coat
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
orangey
and
honey
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
citrusy
hop
not
all
that
inspiring
there
is
a
little
more
hop
on
the
flavor
than
expeted
its
nice
and
spicey
slightly
citrusy
sweet
a
hint
of
sweet
maly
lurks
below
not
bad
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
nice
active
carbonation
i
enjoy
this
brew
the
flavor
is
very
mild
and
keeps
it
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
all
around
not
bad
just
weird
acts
like
a
trappist
ale
but
has
the
heart
of
a
pale
ale
needs
work
imo
drinkability
probably
more
suited
for
the
warmer
months
but
not
bad
drinking
overall
there
are
better
apas
to
be
had
locally
out
there
12
ouncer

the

in
the
end
with
a
nice
clean
dry

light

medium

with
a
crisp
super
carbonated
mouthfeel
pretty
average
it
is
easy
for
me
to
reach
for
another
one
of
these
so
if
you
like
pale
ales
then
do
give
this
one
a
try
poured
a
deep
golden
color
slightly
hazy
good
2
finger
head
and
good

smells
of
moderate
floral
and
citrus
with
malt
overtones
taste
is
at
first
a
sweet
malt
and
then
the
nice
bitterness
of
the
hops
a
nice
balanced
beer
not
too
hoppy
or
malty
just
enough
of
what
i
like
in
a
good
brew
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
final
thought
very
impressed
with
this
one
the
midwest
taster
is
proving
to
be
an
excellent
mix
from
this
region
a
nice
light
orange
color
body
supports
an
assertive
maybe
a
mispour
white
foam
head
with
some
unusually
large
bubbles
smell
manages
to
be
flowery
and
earthy
at
the
same
time
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
about
the
taste
is
the
malt
profile
it
could
be
because
ive
been
drinking
eisenbahns
pale
ale
in
brasil
for
the
last
3
months
which
is
super
flowery
and
citric
and
i
havent
adjusted
to
our
pale
ales
yet
but
malt
is
definately
what
i
first
notice
a
light
i
emphasize
light
citrus
taste
rounds
out
the
flavor
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
ok
nothing
special
and
nothing
bad
an
ok
pale
ale
by
my
book
im
bumping
up
the
taste
a
half
point
after
a
second
pour
i
left
the
bottom
half
inch
in
the
bottle
and
with
it
all
the
harsh
taste
thanks
trbeer
from
the
cask
pours
a
light
goldentan
cloudy
liquid
with
a
white
thick
head
the
head
stayed
for
a
while
the
lacing
was
minimal
not
much
smell
to
this
beer
perhaps
a
slight
floral
smell
the
taste
was
immediately
astringent
sour
and
grainy
it
did
have
a
good
floral
hoppy
finish
there
was
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
but
not
much
medium
body
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
it
did
grow
on
me
as
time
went
by
i
do
enjoy
almost
anything
on
cask
and
although
this
did
not
blow
me
away
it
was
pleasant
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
there
is
lots
and
lots
of
lace
left
over
the
smell
is
both
a
little
malty
and
a
little
hoppy
but
overall
a
little
weak
the
taste
leans
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
lots
of
bread
and
caramel
flavors
some
yeast
present
in
there
as
well
a
little
bit
of
hops
left
on
the
back
of
thre
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
for
the
style
maybe
a
touch
light
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
decent
pale
ale
this
brew
is
a
light
peach
colour
with
a
lovely
white
cap
of
foam
aromas
are
of
light
bready
malts
and
subtle
british
hops
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
bready
biscuity
and
more
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
a
notch
above
average
i
liked
it
there
are
so
many
pales
ales
on
the
market
it
seems
like
every
brewer
has
to
have
one
in
the
lineup
arcardias
offering
pours
out
to
a
light
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
nose
is
that
of
light
fruit
and
hops
the
taste
is
good
but
doesnt
grab
you
in
the
way
that
many
pales
do
when
the
hop
twang
hits
on
the
swallow
a
good
beer
to
recommend
to
those
who
havent
been
exposed
to
the
style
rich
orange
amber
color
reminiscent
of
a
newly
minted
penny
pours
partly
cloudy
neither
clear
nor
hazy
a
fingers
worth
of
tight
offwhite
head
that
is
fed
by
relatively
active
carbonation
smell
is
neither
distinctive
nor
offensivegenerically
sweet
malts
with
detectable
caramel
surprisingly
hoppy
up
front
but
that
bitterness
gets
even
stronger
shortly
after
in
between
those
surges
of
hops
one
finds
a
baseline
of
caramely
malts
an
interesting
fade
to
a
bubbly
finish
mouthfeel
is
merely
okrather
watery
at
the
start
and
a
bit
clingy
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
overly
strong
hops
and
lack
of
integration
make
this
a
hohum
pale
ale
this
is
the
beer
i
tell
my
friends
to
try
who
want
an
introduction
to
microbrews
there
are
no
real
hugely
noticeable
flavors
but
more
of
a
withdrawn
blend
of
flavors
the
beer
is
more
complex
than
i
thought
it
would
be
with
a
good
blend
of
hops
and
somewhat
of
a
nutty
taste
in
it
anglers
ale
goes
down
easy
and
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
have
esp
in
these
hot
summer
days
yuck
a
clear
amber
body
topped
by
a
billowy
ivory
head
the
head
lasts
and
deposits
great
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
malty
and
gives
off
english
style
hops
aromas
the
flavor
is
of
a
bitter
with
plenty
of
malt
backbone
and
hops
overlay
incomplete
blending
of
the
flavors
creates
a
sense
of
disharmony
in
this
beer
pleasant
yet
disconcerting
this
one
would
need
to
be
an
acquired
taste
long
lingering
aftertaste
this
reminds
me
of
some
irish
cream
ales
ive
tasted
that
give
a
lacquerlike
sense
decent
light
body
and
good
carbonation
make
it
pretty
drinkable
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
again
pours
a
hazy
copper
gold
with
an
amazingly
persistent
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
suspended
particles
aroma
is
very
light
with
some
caramel
and
floral
notes
with
a
touch
of
orange
flavor
begins
with
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
some
herbal
spiciness
and
finishing
bitterness
not
very
sweet
and
very
subtly
flavored
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
an
very
mild
pale
ale
that
would
be
an
ok
session
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
decent
the
perfect
goldenamber
quaffer
when
trolling
for
walleye
or
just
watching
someone
else
do
it
on
tv
a
nose
full
of
dirt
and
a
few
curls
of
lemon
skin
earthy
hops
linger
against
an
artful
toasty
backdrop
a
precise
carbonation
makes
this
beer
a
session
treat
english
indeed
hazy
copper
pour
with
little
chunks
of
yeast
forms
a
thin
white
head
with
large
bubbles
moderately
carbonated
starts
with
a
brisk
pleasant
english
hop
note
which
quickly
dissolves
into
a
somewhat
muddy
subtle
wet
cardboard
mustiness
leaves
the
tongue
with
a
mediocre
glaze
not
being
a
big
fan
of
epas
to
begin
with
i
would
rate
this
as
just
average
could
definitely
benefit
from
harder
water
to
achieve
a
brisker
mouthfeel
arcadia
anglers
ale
hmmm
ive
been
disappointed
with
this
mixed
twelve
pack
the
tastes
are
fairly
faithful
to
their
styles
but
the
flavor
is
very
middle
of
the
road
this
style
has
a
fairly
under
whelming
hop
a
little
malt
and
a
whole
lot
of
nothing
ill
pass
it
by
next
time
part
of
and
arcadia
sampler
not
a
very
good
translation
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
disappeared
quickly
thin
and
quick
lacing
aroma
was
malty
and
slightly
pungent
flavor
is
mostly
malty
with
a
hops
presence
and
kind
of
sour
aftertaste
this
was
too
mild
to
be
a
great
epa
in
my
opinion
pours
a
nice
orangeamber
color
modest
beige
head
the
lace
pleasant
as
well
but
they
vanish
quickly
leaving
lumpy
globs
upon
the
glass
malt
nose
dominates
clean
and
crisp
the
start
slightly
sweet
thin
top
finish
is
charmingly
hopped
enchantingly
acidic
droughty
long
lasting
aftertaste
as
with
the
nut
brown
pretty
much
run
of
the
mill
and
drinkable
which
is
why
we
buy
beer
very
nutty
flavorhad
alcohol
almost
whiskey
type
undertones
to
it
didnt
quite
expect
that
was
quite
hoppy
though
wich
is
a
good
thing
all
around
solid
beer
would
buy
it
again
best
beer
that
brooklyn
makes
grain
light
floral
notes
with
a
fairly
bitter
finish
crackery
malt
and
theres
a
bit
of
a
tangymetallic
character
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
pouring
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
color
was
a
rich
nutty
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
very
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
backed
up
the
aroma
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
was
rich
and
the
carbonation
level
very
good
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
any
fan
of
english
style
pale

that
creates
no
lacework
and

little
retention
nose
is
watery
with
notes
of
corn
tastes
like
it
couldnt
decide
what
it
wanted
to
be
when
it
grew
up
an
english
ale
a
pint
of
yeungling
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
hop
and
malt
characteristics
are
poorly
matched
as
if
someone
had
blended
a
soso
lager
with
an
ale
although
some
of
the
characteristics
might
have
been
likeable
in
a
more
balanced
beer
its
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
and
would
certainly
not
try
it
again
overall
i
love
english
ales
but
something
about
this
is
just
not
my
cup
of
beer
this
has
a
light
tart
quality
that
i
am
not
expecting
from
an
english
ale
but
it
is
maltier
than
i
would
want
a
summertime
backyard
barbecue
beer
oeasy
to
drink
low
abv
smooth
and
refreshing
these
factors
make
this
a
very
drinkable
ale
however
there
is
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
definitely
wont
satisfy
those
looking
for
the
big
hop
flavor
not
a
favorite
but
could
see
myself
putting
another
back
as
im
grilling
after
work
overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
there
are
some
ice
flavors
buried
in
there
but
it
is
a
little
muddy
overall
and
a
bit
too
sticky
bottom
line
brooklyn
is
3
for
3
with
me
pennant
brown
summer
this
brew
is
solid
and
it
might
be
just
enough
different
from
brooklyns
summer
ale
also
an
english
pale
ale
to
offer
some
legitimate
variety
and
as
always
brooklyn
gets
a
little
bonus
bump
from
me
for
brewing
up
an
authentic
english
style
you
gotta
try
the
home
field
pennant
ale
that
is
a
throwback
to
what
ales
in
the
50s
were
all
about
kind
of
like
the
old
ballentine
ale
i
remember
as
a
kid
overall
awfully
drinkable
but
not
especially
distinctive
overall
this
is
not
a
very
bitter
ale
and
is
not
for
a
big
hops
fan
but
i
did
enjoy
it
the
flavor
was
not
as
complex
as
other
pale
ales
but
what
it
had
was
quite
enjoyable
an
extremely
sessionable
ale
as
it
is
refreshing
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
plus
the
relatively
simple
flavor
means
you
wont
miss
too
much
if
you
get
a
little
drunker
not
quite
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
overall
pretty
average
epa
overall
decent
sessional
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
but
one
wont
leave
much
of
an
impression
or
leave
you
wanting

this

is

overall
extremely
similar
to

if
you
like
that
then
you
should
try

i

hoppy
quite
drinkable
not
bad
for
an
english
pale
ale
thats
out
of
date
it
seems
the
biscuity
flavors
are
replaces
with
honey
which
works
out
fine
im
sure
this
would
have
been
much
better
fresh
with
some
extra
hop
action
i
know
i
give
generous
ratings
but
for
brooklyn
pennant
it
is
especially
welldeserved
this
beer
has
all
the
great
characteristics
of
english
ale
but
is
a
really
good
reasonably
priced
domestic
all
aspects
of
it
are
on
point
for
style
look
smell
and
flavor
not
too
sweet
either
the
best
part
is
the
bready
and
yeasty
flavor
that
comes
through
hop
flavor
is
aromatic
slightly
herbal
but
not
so
bitter
it
can
only
be
perceived
as
bland
if
you
drink
it
too
cold
this
is
ale
let
it
warm
a
little
to
let
the
flavors
surface
one
of
my
favorites
decent
brew
definitely
an
english
style
it
pours
caramel
in
color
totally
clear
with
plentiful
rising
bubbles
that
form
an
inch
of
thick
white
head
the
nose
is
bitter
i
expected
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
its
not
really
there
lots
of
malt
though
bready
and
a
little
heavy
with
only
a
gentle
bittering
hop
profile
on
the
back
end
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
smell
a
little
dull
but
a
balanced
brew
still
hardly
a
hint
of
sweetness
smooth
texture
mellow
but
ample
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
thats
right
on
overall
a
decent
beer
not
one
ill
be
reaching
for
with
any
serious
intent
from
the
mix
pack
but
one
i
definitely
dont
mind
oa
decent
pale
ale
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
definition
of
a
highlysessionable
brew
great
balanced
easily
drinkable
demanding
of
another
sip
worth
many
tries
orather
disappointed
with
this
one
very
bland
and
thin
might
be
a
nice
alternative
to
bmc
lagers
but
there
are
many
better
pale
ales
out
there
tartness
is
really
off
putting
in
fairness
the
bottle
was
3
months
past
its
best
buy
date
o
very
drinkable
just
a
good
solid
beer
o
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
that
seems
true
to
its
style
if
a
bit
heavily
carbonated
and
perhaps
a
bit
sweeter
than
average
3
9
medium
body
medium
to
slightly
high
carbonation
drinks
clean
enough
maybe
this
style
isnt
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
little
bland
and
unmemorable
you
could
certainly
do
worse
in
terms
of
an
everyday
sessionstrength
english
style
ale
but
there
was
something
distinctly
unexciting
about
this
for
me
seems
like
i
might
enjoy
it
more
caskconditioned
than
from
a
bottle
o
a
very
nice
english
pale
with
great
drinkability
worthy
of
a
few
pints
overall
quite
nice
and
drinkable
a
fantastically
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
good
flavors
pours
a
mostly
clear
copper
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
scent
is
mild
with
a
blend
of
malts
and
hops
giving
it
that
indication
it
will
have
a
slight
bitter
taste
the
taste
is
better
than
average
with
a
smooth
grainy
taste
that
is
sweet
and
quite
refreshing
the
after
taste
is
where
the
hops
start
to
take
over
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
stands
true
to
its
style
12oz
bottle
purchased
in
a
mixed
12pk
at
market
basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
khakicolored
head
herbal
and
citrussy
hops
are
the
most
obvious
things
in
the
aroma
herbal
and
citrussy
english
hops
dominate
the
flavor
with
bits
of
bread
and
caramel
notes
light
to
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
quite
good
pleasant
quaffable
and
balanced
another
one
of
the
mix
six
beers
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
beer
from
brooklyn
brewery
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
but
no
lacing
a
nice
body
and
flavor
decent
hop
presents
a
nice
beer
which
i
wish
i
would
of
bought
a
second
bottle
of
as
i
drank
through
the
rest
of
the
glass
the
flavors
seem
to
find
eachother
a
bit
more
but
still
seem
to
battle
for
dominance
not
as
bad
as
my
initial
reaction
to
the
beer
but
still
doesnt
seem
right
these
flavors
just
dont
wanna
blend
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
to
keep
in
the
fridge
or
i
would
get
it
on
tap
o
have
had
this
many
times
and
is
always
welcome
at
my
table
and
bar
thanks
garrett
and
all
at
brooklyn
not
a
bad
beer
a
decent
offering
from
brooklyn
o
if
its
been
in
the
fridge
try
drinking
this
beer
after
its
been
warmed
for
a
halfhour
to
an
hour
the
mild
fruitiness
is
interesting
pretty
solid
offering
from
brooklyn
brewery
i
like
to
alternate
between
this
one
and
the
lager
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
really
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
it
is
nice
and
mild
but
it
just
doesnt
hold
my
interest
very
well
moreover
the
malt
is
balanced
more
by
tartness
than
bitterness
still
its
tasty
and
refreshing
overall
its
a
good
beer
an
honestly
for
the
price
it
doesnt
disapoint
right
now
having
at
my
cousins
bbq
to
follow
with
a
great
cigar
salud
this
is
a
solid
balanced
beer
but
its
not
incredibly
flavorful
its
refreshing
and
drinks
well
on
a
hot
day
o
fantastic
english
pale
ale
fits
the
style
to
a
tee
and
does
not
disappoint
in
any
category
highly
recommended
as
well
as
a
great
example
of
a
style
thats
starting
to
become
neglected
by
the
craft
breweries
i
can
feel
the
english
malt
here
but
its
definitely
more
caramelly
than
im
used
to
i
didnt
know
the
style
but
i
thought
it
was
a
marzen
i
wasnt
sold
on
the
taste
it
was
a
bit
too
caramelly
too
sweet
and
had
an
off
flavor
i
couldnt
pin
down
malt
forward
with
no
hop
flavors
at
all
smooth
to
the
point
of
being
dry
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
light
bright
copperorange
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
film
coating
the
surface
and
a
fast
steady
flow
of
carbonation
bubbling
aromas
are
light
with
a
roasted
toffee
balancing
out
a
floral
and
effervescent
hops
profile
flavors
are
light
and
a
little
sharp
from
the
carbonation
with
a
roasty
toasty
toffee
backbone
and
some
floral
and
peppery
hops
lightly
cleaning
up
the
end
of
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
a
tangy
sweet
toffee
flavor
with
a
clean
crisp
and
someone
astringent
finish
good
flavors
but
the
body
doesnt
do
the
beer
any
favors
pours
a
thick
dark
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
that
dissolves
relatively
quickly
smell
is
sugary
and
malty
very
nice
not
an
overly
sweet
beer
more
just
malty
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
amount
of
carbonation
is
pretty
perfect
a
great
session
beer
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
more
bars
and
restaurants
to
have
on
tap
as
an
alternative
to
not
only
the
budweiser
and
millter
lites
but
also
to
the
sam
adams
and
blue
moons
overall
certainly
drinkable
my
understanding
of
the
style
is
limited
but
this
one
seems
to
be
relatively
on
par
overall
i
like
it
it
goes
down
quick
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
really
lives
up
to
the
name
as
its
light
enough
for
summer
malty
enough
for
fall
and
hoppy
enough
for
spring
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
drink
just
an
eh
beer
for
me
didnt
leave
me
feeling
overly
joyed
in
comparison
to
some
brooklyn
beers
i
have
had
odnot
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
drank
it
quick
enough
but
was
never
truly
satisfied
would
not
try
this
again
too
mediocre
o
the
malt
flavor
is
the
standout
here
while
the
hops
and
other
spices
lend
a
nice
complement
easy
drinking
and
very
sessionable
definitely
a
good
beer
ok
but
not
amazing
not
sure
why
this
is
classified
as
a
pale
ale
its
more
like
a
bitterbrown
ale
decent
malt
and
yeast
presence
but
too
much
stewed
hop
character
and
not
enough
aroma
drinkable
enough
but
nothing
special
o
ok
watching
a
game
beer
sort
of
a
more
flavorful
yuengling
i
say
this
as
a
compliment
nothing
special
though
could
use
less
carbonation
and
something
to
make
it
more
unique
gets
a
3
5
because
its
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
but
doesnt
fit
the
style
and
doesnt
wow
its
still
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
considering
so
many
of
the
larger
company
brews
this
one
is
still
better
lots
of
the
maris
otter
taste
which
is
to
say
there
isnt
much
going
on
just
a
general
beer
blandness
like
a
little
bit
of
tea
with
it
i
think
this
is
just
kind
of
like
their
bmc
baseball
crowd
type
of
niche
beer
there
are
no
off
flavors
its
a
very
mild
breadiness
and
smooth
flavor
profile
its
pretty
soft
all
the
way
around
aside
from
the
carbonation
its
up
there
to
keep
the
mild
bready
current
from
weighing
down
on
the
aftertaste
really
you
could
make
a
lot
of
those
silly
bmc
slogans
they
put
on
their
commercials
off
this
beer
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
a
high
sweet
malt
not
that
much
hops
but
is
fine
for
the
style
the
malty
tastes
dominate
with
a
nice
hop
finish
that
balances
the
whole
beer
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
with
proper
carbonation
and
one
that
can
definitely
be
drank
all
night
overall
a
very
fine
english
pale
ale
that
will
probably
become
a
fallback
for
me
overall
good
easily
drinkable
but
semi
bland
flavor
kind
of
lacking
in
the
hops
department
for
a
pale
ale
but
decent
brew
o
interesting
ale
that
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
reminds
me
of
some
of
fullers
offerings
poured
a
12
beige
head
of
both
fine
velvet
and
soap
suds
the
body
is
burnt
orange
in
mass
tone
but
held
to
the
light
its
more
of
an
apricot
theres
a
pretty
nice
smell
of
malt
and
mild
hops
taste
although
in
the
spirit
of
mainstream
bmc
ballpark
brews
also
happens
to
be
richer
creamier
and
sweeter
in
the
process
body
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
and
theres
a
soapy
aftertaste
but
overall
this
is
a
nicely
put
together
beer
easy
to
enjoy
many
of
at
the
park
or
at
home
i
have
had
friends
tell
me
they
detect
a
vinegary
taste
to
the
beer
but
i
cant
seem
to
replicate
it
overall
its
actually
a
nice
basic
ale
in
my
opinion
its
got
that
vibe
of
a
lounge
playing
pool
this
beer
in
its
flavors
seem
to
bring
me
some
nostalgia
and
i
like
it
as
far
as
the
beer
goes
its
basic
but
refreshing
and
crisp
big
malt
flavors
with
a
decent
amount
of
hoppyness
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
good
people
down
at
brooklyn
just
quality
and
solid
all
around
o
good
not
great
i
was
underwhelmed
with
how
little
hop
flavor
was
in
this
given
its
english
in
origin
ekg
or
fuggles
are
at
play
here
o
this
was
just
and
ok
pale
ale
for
me
it
was
easily
drinkable
but
pretty
forgettable
o
really
nice
beer
good
nose
and
flavor
may
have
benefitted
from
a
bit
of
a
bigger
abv
and
body
but
nonetheless
a
great
session
choice
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
bubble
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
was
of
some
light
hops
and
some
decent
malt
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
airy
nothing
too
extreme
at
all
here
overall
this
beer
is
a
good
drinking
brew
for
a
social
setting
or
as
a
quick
thirst
quencher
not
too
bad
an
ok
lager
ideal
for
when
you
dont
want
to
think
much
about
your
beer
overall
a
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
had
a
nice
mild
hop
finish
which
just
enhanced
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
overall
a
nice
ale
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
even
the
very
novice
drinkers
light
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
an
excellent
beer
overall
decent
beer
overall
while
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
it
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
either
typical
english
style
pale
maris
otter
malts
come
through
strong
crackerbiscuit
taste
is
the
backbone
of
this
beer
not
much
hops
o
big
smell
big
flavor
just
not
the
best
of
either
a
solid
enough
offering
though
o
enjoyable
brew
that
even
a
yankee
fan
like
myself
would
drink
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
hops
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
copper
color
i
really
have
to
stick
my
nose
in
there
to
smell
anything
at
all
if
i
could
describe
the
smell
in
one
word
it
would
be
toasty
as
for
taste
a
good
light
malt
flavor
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
and
i
see
myself
having
it
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
something
too
heavy
moderate
one
finger
head
of
darker
cream
white
with
less
than
average
retention
the
lacing
forms
a
thin
sheet
down
the
glass
sides
that
slowly
slides
into
oblivion
the
liquid
is
a
slightly
murky
muddy
orange
hue
as
close
to
brown
as
to
red
some
loose
bubbles
trying
to
form
beads
here
and
there
theres
some
roast
in
the
nose
alongside
the
caramel
honeyed
nuts
and
hard
butterscotch
candy
scents
does
have
a
greener
more
herbal
side
as
well
with
some
mixed
white
citrus
spritz
apricot
and
apple
fruit
muscular
and
lasts
for
some
time
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
wants
to
make
it
fluffy
but
it
is
pretty
damn
dense
not
a
beer
which
just
glides
down
the
chute
on
the
sweet
side
the
caramel
scone
soda
bread
pairs
well
with
the
peach
apricot
yellow
apple
fruit
some
lemon
peel
but
nothing
sour
nor
biting
again
presents
a
grassy
undercurrent
but
by
no
means
a
focal
point
brings
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
suggestive
of
complexity
while
remaining
safely
accessible
i
can
see
this
as
an
adventuresome
beer
to
some
otherwise
would
drink
it
if
handed
one
but
unlikely
to
seek
out
for
further
purchase
pours
amber
in
color
brilliantly
clear
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
aroma
is
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
a
bit
heavier
on
the
side
of
malt
a
bit
fruity
maybe
some
caramel
as
well
pleasant
taste
builds
up
on
aroma
initial
low
bitterness
is
followed
by
smoothness
of
malt
medium
to
light
body
low
carbonation
very
clean
and
drinkable
overall
in
general
terms
a
good
beer
judged
to
style
its
an
excellent
beer
overall
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
one
to
write
home
about
the
nose
is
nice
and
would
be
sessionable
overall
a
very
drinkable
malt
forward
pale
ale
a
good
example
of
the
style
notes
inoffensive
easy
drinking
but
it
lacks
any
kind
of
sharpness
or
bitterness
the
beer
is
like
an
alcoholic
iced
tea
i
dont
know
why
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
review
this
pours
a
deep
amber
very
little
head
scent
is
sweet
hoppy
almost
rumlike
a
bit
taste
is
a
bit
malty
caramel
flavors
come
through
nice
even
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
neutral
crisp
and
a
touch
sweet
really
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
a
repeat
purchase
and
a
drinkable
pale
ale
i
had
this
on
cask
at
bierkraft
it
was
reasonably
tasty
but
nothing
overspecial
copper
color
clear
with
a
thin
foam
bready
aroma
more
malty
than
hoppy
english
smelling
i
think
the
cask
presentation
suits
it
well
probably
this
is
the
only
way
id
really
like
this
beer
easy
drinking
but
kind
of
bland
o
not
bad
easy
drinking
for
sure
its
well
made
just
wasnt
feeling
it
that
much
still
good
though
overall
not
too
bad
i
would
have
this
again
depending
on
what
else
is
available
overall
yeah
beer
screams
english
pale
ale
not
the
biggest
fan
of
buttery
ales
but
it
works
here
and
brooklyn
hits
the
mark
for
style
pretty
good
beer
not
great
recommended
worth
drinking
but
not
a
beer
you
go
out
of
your
way
for
not
bad
but
not
great
either
for
a
session
beer
it
would
compliment
the
late
summer
and
fall
months
of
baseball
watching
well
o
the
sum
is
greater
than
its
parts
really
quite
a
good
beer
understated
and
winning
for
it
this
is
a
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
o
my
fav
beer
from
brooklyn
a
great
traditionl
style
done
well
definitely
having
again
brooklyn
pennant
ale
makes
a
nice
session
english
pale
ale
it
was
a
nice
beer
overall
with
some
great
flavors
to
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
search
it
out
next
time
around
brooklyn
pennant
ale
pours
a
clear
burnt
orange
head
formation
is
minimal
to
say
the
least
leaving
no
opportunity
for
the
pleasant
affectations
that
come
along
with
a
foam
crown
namely
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
muted
but
a
little
bit
manages
to
make
its
way
out
of
the
glass
biscuity
malts
and
a
buttery
note
are
what
command
attention
with
some
light
herbal
hoppiness
present
as
well
the
malt
is
more
cracker
than
biscuit
and
surprisingly
crisp
with
just
a
hint
of
diacetyl
bleeding
through
into
the
back
end
of
each
sip
the
same
herbal
hoppiness
from
the
nose
is
back
this
time
with
a
little
bit
of
a
spicy
pepper
presence
added
into
the
mix
the
body
is
nice
and
light
while
still
being
solid
enough
to
support
the
not
insignificant
malt
base
the
carbonation
though
could
probably
stand
to
be
just
a
tad
more
active
brooklyn
pennant
ale
was
an
alright
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
an
american
ipa
style
palate
shredder
as
far
as
hops
go
but
i
do
think
the
beers
a
bit
too
restrained
in
that
regard
o
a
tasty
english
pale
ale
but
the
flavours
could
be
a
bit
more
bold
might
be
good
for
someone
just
trying
to
enter
into
the
world
of
english
pale
ales
and
esbs
but
the
flavours
are
a
little
too
mild
for
my
liking
o
solid
beer
that
isnt
too
daring
but
is
a
pretty
good
staple
it
must
have
been
the
baseball
theme
that
made
me
think
it
wasnt
going
to
be
that
great
probably
because
the
best
beer
you
can
usually
get
at
a
baseball
game
is
coors
lite
o
not
a
groundbreaking
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
from
my
first
sip
i
thought
this
would
be
a
fine
session
beer
not
too
heavy
on
the
senses
yet
still
retains
a
comfortable
distinctiveness
o
i
wish
the
hops
came
through
a
bit
more
on
the
taste
but
this
is
still
a
very
flavorful
wellmade
beer
o
prefer
their
brown
ale
to
this
not
blown
away
by
this
one
very
great
summertime
ale
not
a
bad
english
pale
ale
though
there
is
a
bit
of
salty
umami
character
that
throws
me
off
a
bit
on
the
whole
though
the
marris
otter
malt
shines
through
in
the
nutty
biscuity
character
and
gives
it
a
nice
flavor
not
too
shabby
though
not
my
first
choice
poured
a
nice
light
amber
maybe
even
a
deep
golden
slight
haze
thin
white
head
aroma
is
simply
pouring
out
of
my
glass
nice
citrusy
and
earthy
notes
all
over
followed
by
a
subtle
sweet
cereal
graininess
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
wish
they
made
more
casks
of
this
well
made
and
delicious
ever
so
smooth
and
velvety
thanks
to
the
cask
excuse
my
mickey
ds
reference
but
im
lovin
it
thusly
ive
had
their
ipa
and
pa
and
both
were
englishstyle
and
pretty
good
representations
i
shall
continue
my
research
into
their
product
line
i
have
not
had
this
ale
in
years
it
seemed
everytime
i
looked
for
it
the
ale
was
beyond
its
freshness
date
the
mild
but
interesting
flavors
and
low
abv
make
this
one
quite
sessionable
the
beer
is
alright
but
fell
a
little
short
i
drank
this
beer
and
i
took
notes
on
it
but
its
almost
like
i
didnt
drink
it
theres
that
little
to
it
nothing
to
latch
onto
no
notable
subtlety
or
complexity
to
the
smell
or
the
flavor
nothing
specifically
bad
about
it
but
not
much
good
about
it
either
o
just
average
imo
in
its
style
mostly
malts
and
bread
hops
missing
in
this
one
a
decent
ale
nothing
spectacular
not
bad
very
drinkable
nay
sessionable
even
but
something
id
be
hard
pressed
to
bother
paying
for
again
amidst
a
sea
of
better
more
compelling
beers
hey
its
brooklyn
who
wants
an
english
pale
ale
at
the
ballpark
youse
nose
wadda
im
sayin
d
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
im
sure
it
would
have
more
body
and
the
hops
would
most
likely
be
a
little
more
present
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
one
very
impressive
epa
i
wish
more
brewers
could
nail
this
style
so
well
as
i
often
get
bored
by
them
great
everyday
beer
overall
a
pretty
decent
version
of
an
english
pale
ale
i
really
like
the
initial
malt
impression
of
this
beer
but
it
fades
very
quick
too
watery
for
my
liking
maybe
if
the
abv
was
dialed
down
a
little
more
id
write
it
off
as
a
hell
of
a
mild
i
like
this
but
it
could
be
improved
with
a
bit
more
body
onot
the
most
flavorful
pale
ale
out
there
however
it
is
one
of
the
most
sessionable
a
great
lawn
mowing
beer
to
crack
open
after
a
day
of
work
light
but
at
the
same
time
has
enough
bitterness
to
discern
itself
from
witbiers
hefes
and
similar
styles
grade
bpurchased
at
stoneys
9
99
per
6pack
a
little
dissapointing
from
a
brewery
that
i
really
like
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
definitely
drink
this
over
any
bmc
offering
the
beer
pours
a
clear
bronze
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
floral
and
herbal
hops
with
a
hint
of
caramel
it
is
pleasant
but
on
the
weak
side
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
floral
hops
but
it
vanishes
quickly
into
nothing
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
that
i
will
not
be
drinking
again
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
off
for
me
but
otherwise
a
good
pale
ale
this
was
offered
to
me
as
my
local
water
hole
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
this
beer
to
make
room
for
a
different
beer
to
my
surprise
this
beer
really
wasnt
that
bad
it
was
a
little
dark
in
its
appearance
the
taste
a
slightly
little
bitter
but
refreshing
none
the
less
i
have
never
seen
this
beer
before
more
less
heard
of
it
it
is
not
a
bad
recommendation
overall
pretty
decent
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
within
the
best
by
date
to
see
if
its
any
better
overall
maybe
its
the
logo
on
the
front
but
this
beer
leaves
me
pining
for
the
bleachers
at
fenway
just
a
week
or
two
away
great
early
summer
beer
i
wish
they
served
this
out
there

this
isnt
a

but
a
nice
easy

nonetheless
into
a
duvel

with
a
clear
copper

with
very
little
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
upfront
is
metallic
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
becomes
sweeter
with
a
floral
hop
quality
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
but
has
more
of
a
bitter
hop
profile
to
it
its
got
a
slight
dry
biscuity
taste
to
it
prickly
when
it
hits
the
tongue
but
not
i
was
hard
pressed
to
pull
a
good
experience
from
this
pours
a
light
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
thick
off

head
and
little
to
no
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts

and
a
little
fruitiness
and
grain
tastes
of
a
little
grain
sweet
malts
hops
and
a
little
citrus
fruit
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
mild
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
d
a
wellcrafted
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
i
would
probably
order
it
again
if
i
saw
it
was
on
tap
price
d
the
balance
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
which
might
be
its
greatest
quality
because
it
seems
like
when
i
head
to
the
fridge
im
frequently
reaching
for
this
beer
i
think
that
this
brew
is
fantastic
i
have
tried
a
lot
of
arcadias
englishstyle
ales
and
this
one
blows
them
out
of
the
park
so
much
flavor
and
so
refreshing
for
the
style
two
big
thumbs
up
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
if
this
is
your
sort
of
thing
those
who
like
english
ales
will
love
this
from
a
bottle
thats
best
before
2
2011
into
a
brooklyn
tulip
on

this
pours
a
clear
and
carbonated
looking
bright
medium
amber
color
under
a
nicely
sustained
thin
head
aroma
carries
a
moderate
flowery
hop
nose
thats
also
mildly
metallic
sweet
and
possibly
caramel
noted
opening
has
a
big
carbonated
sour
and
tart
citrus
feel
that
quickly
empties
out
into
a
refreshing
malt
scrub
over
the
palate
toward
a
pleasant
toasted
malt
and
earthy
orange
citrus
finish
not
bad
at
all
for
a
bottle
on
its
last
good
month
pours
a
huge
three
finger
head
off
white
in
color
clear
amber
body
smells
of
crystal
malts
noble
hops
some
grassy
notes
tastes
of
crystal
malts
noble
hops
earthy
mineraly
medium
bodied
medium
carbing
this
one
is
especially
plesant
for
its
mouthfeel
very
balanced
and
neutral
nothing
harsh
or
offensive
i
could
easily
finsh
a
sixer
of
this
1
75
a
single
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
brooklyn
is
a
great
brewery
and
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
again
d
easy
drinking
sessionable
ale
nice
to
look
at
at
but
lacks
any
real
flavour
profile
to
keep
me
interested
lack
of
hop
bite
in
the
finish
is
disappointing
but
i
cant
call
the
beer
imbalanced
since
any
apparent
malt
note
is
very
subdued
overall
boring
really
nice
very
sessionable
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
enjoy
it
all
year
enough
malts
to
invite
me
during
the
winter
and
a
good
clean
dry
finish
that
makes
it
not
too
heavy
definitely
sessionable
pours
an
impressive
looking
clear
orangeishamber
with
a
large
fluffy
light
beige
head
that
leaves
a
nice
slick
on
top
of
my
beer
for
the
duration
aroma
was
malt
dominant
with
amber
malts
honey
on
brown
toast
and
some
grassy
hops
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
end
flavor
isnt
quite
as
pronounced
as
the
aroma
but
was
basically
some
cereal
grains
toast
caramel
and
a
slight
touch
of
sourness
very
sessionable
but
average
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
even
if
it
is
lacking
a
little
something
in
the
flavor
drink
this
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
fullers
esb
or
along
the
same
lines
anyways
it
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
anytime
its
highly
sessionable
d
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
is
decently
refreshing
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
ultimately
forgettable
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
md
moderate
carbonation
and
body
easy
to
drink
but
forgetable
drinkabilityoverall
wonderful
drinkable
ale
that
is
a
total
treat
to
have
on
cask
balanced
and
flavorful
yet
simple
and
perfect
i
have
no
idea
how
to
get
my
homebrew
on
cask
but
im
going
to
have
to
look
into
it
i
know
that
some
people
have
done
it
drinkability
this
beer
is
alright
nothing
fancy
nothing
special
and
nothing
really
bad
could
be
an
excellent
spring
or
summer
brew
went
down
pretty
easy
d
its
a
decent
average

is

dgood
this
is
a

dodgers
but
its
not
anything
remarkable
a
pleasant
beer
d
while
not
top
of
the
line
english
pale
i
find
this
highly
drinkable
and
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
i
can
see
if
youre
turned
off
by
the
sourness
in
the
flavor
profile
that
you
wouldnt
care
but
i
kind
of
like
it
overall
this
is
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
another
im
a
fan
of
the
brooklyn
brewery
but
the
pennant
ale
isnt
anything
to
get
too
excited
over
suggestion
drink
pennant
ale
while
reading
delillos
underworlda
book
following
bobby
thomsons
home
run
ball
from
the
hit
to
the
early
90s
it
the
beer
and
the
book
has
the
rustic
ruggedness
of
the
old
times
when
baseball
was
really
great
the
final
verdict
is
that
its
very
drinkable
and
not
offensive
in
any
way
but
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
d
the
taste
is
off
putting
and
makes
this
a
difficult
beer
to
put
back
drinkability
a
decent
interpretation
of
an
english
pale
ale
very
sessionable
and
easydrinking
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
one
or
a
few
of
these
again
this
is
an
above
average
pale
ale
nothing
outstanding
but
the
fruit
and
caramel
presence
make
it
worth
a
try
drink
well
my
friends
overall
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
incredibly
exceptional
i
would
definitely
give
it
a
shot
this
beer
would
be
very
sessionable
thanks
to
the
balance
would
be
good
with
food
too
not
too
bad
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
if
its
one
of
a
limited
number
of
decent
craft
selections
and
you
arent
in
the
mood
for
something
too
hoppy
a
nice
balanced
pale
ale
the
fruitiness
and
floral
nature
paying
clear
homage
to
the
old
world
definitely
good
for
at
least
a
few
rounds
ho
hum
beer
it
pours
mildly
hazy
and
medium
to
light
amber
the
head
is
offwhite
and
looks
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
mild
floralish
hops
and
generic
biscuity
malt
its
english
enough
i
guess
and
might
be
a
nice
beer
fresh
served
from
a
cask
at
the
brewery
but
from
a
bottle
thats
not
too
far
from
the
best
by
date
its
nothing
special
or
even
notable
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
gently
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
normal
carbonation
a
bit
slick
d
decent
enough
would
make
a
good
conversion
beer
imo
i
may
have
been
more
impressed
if
the
bottle
said
wheat
beer
mfd
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
smooth
crisp
swallow
a
decent
brew
for
a
hot
day
d
good
brew
not
overwhelming
d
as
mentioned
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
definitely
could
have
had
more
than
one
for
this
review
but
really
didnt
want
to
good
but
not
great
brooklyn
has
made
better
see
local
1
or
2
dvery
drinkable
i
had
two
doing
this
review
and
it
was
less
wordy
than
my
normal
reviews
notes
its
a
nicely
balanced
ale
and
even
that
acidic
finish
doesnt
ruin
it
im
not
at
all
sure
what
style
it
is
i
guess
somewhere
between
an
epa
and
a
blonde
ale
given
the
sporty
theme
im
guessing
its
indended
to
be
refreshing
and
tasty
but
not
distractingly
complex
and
it
succeeds
at
this
goal
another
great
beer
from
brooklyn
brewery
that
i
hope
to
enjoy
more
of
in
the
future
reviewed
from
my
notes
poured
from
a
bottle
marked
best
before
nov
2010
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
copper
liquid
with
a
big
offwhite
head
made
of
small
bubbles
lots
of
additional
small
bubbles
are
rising
within
the
glass
it
has
a
grassy
fruit
aroma
are
those
green
apples
i
smell
some
medium
colored
not
pale
or
dark
malt
sweetness
is
noticeable
there
is
a
lot
of
pale
malt
flavor
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
a
kiss
of
toffee
is
also
in
the
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
it
leaves
a
slick
film
on
my
tongue
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
a
six
pack
of
this
style
but
any
that
came
in
a
variety
pack
would
be
welcome
d
drinkable
yes
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
another
im
a
fan
of
the
brooklyn
brewery
but
the
pennant
ale
comes
across
as
more
of
a
placeholder
in
their
portfolio
than
anything
else
d
very
quaffable
enough
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
drinkability
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
i
would
definitely
sit
down
with
a
couple
of
these
down
the
pub
especially
if
youre
a
met
fan
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
and
had
a
1inch
tight
white
head
that
faded
down
into
lacing
that
stayed
with
the
beer
the
beer
was
well
carbonated
and
had
a
wonderful
copper
brown
color
the
smell
is
a
very
heavy
maltbiscuit
with
slight
floral
hop
smell
tast
very
malty
at
the
front
with
hints
of
fruit
and
biscuit
slight
floral
hop
taste
but
this
beer
is
all
malt
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
not
overly
carbonated
but
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
drinkablitity
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
definately
have
more
than
just
one
great
with
pizza
and
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
sessionable
drinkability
the
carbonation
keeps
throwing
me
im
expecting
a
flatter
english
ale
and
instead
i
get
the
higher
carbonation
one
would
get
with
a
us
beer
its
not
bad
but
the
grassy
hop
flavor
isnt
quite
doing
it
for
me
its
satisfying
but
i
think
it
was
better
when
first
poured
and
cold
poured
ambercopper
into
a
pint
glass
with
two
fingers
of
slightly
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
good
lacing
great
hints
of
toffee
walnut
caramel
apple
pear
and
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
was
simply
a
very
good
balance
of
fruitnuttoffeemalt
that
progressed
to
a
dry
modestly
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fullbodied
with
modest
carbonation
highly
sessionable
ale
that
i
would
love
to
try
a
caskfermented
version
of
d
very
tasty
and
balanced
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
d
i
like
this
beer
a
nice
version
of
the
english
style
easy
to
drink
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
necessarily
special
but
still
pretty
good
highly
sessionable
i
could
have
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
pleasant
brew
but
not
necessarily
the
first
one
id
go
for
d
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
brooklyn
i
just
think
there
isnt
much
going
on
except
some
light
bready
malts
i
would
much
rather
just
buy
their
lager
amber
red
to
copper
with
good
clarity
offwhite
thin
head
that
left
no
cap
to
speak
of
a
swirl
of
the
glass
kicks
up
the
lazy
carbonation
sweet
caramel
aromas
with
very
light
floral
undertones
flavor
is
a
lot
of
the
same
sweet
malty
taste
with
faint
hop
character
very
easy
to
drink
but
relatively
uneventful
ale
nice
body
to
this
ale
yet
easy
to
drink
even
on
a
hot
day
i
would
not
identify
it
as
an
english
pale
ale
but
thats
just
me
pours
a
copperish
color
with
a
half
finger
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
sugar
with
hints
of
floral
hops
at
the
back
end
the
taste
has
a
sweet
backbone
caramel
malt
and
some
breadiness
come
through
there
is
a
very
small
fruitiness
in
the
middle
with
the
end
having
a
slight
floral
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
it
isnt
the
best
english
pale
ale
but
every
solid
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
it
but
not
enough
to
make
you
crave
more
and
more
like
some
others
for
the
style
this
is
hardly
undrinkable
however
i
feel
superhydrated
but
not
bloated
a
refreshing
hot
weather
drink
or
mixer
had
a
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
this
is
decent
session
ale
but
compared
to
most
brooklyn
beers
which
i
love
this
beer
just
isnt
that
complex
or
flavorful
theres
a
little
bit
of
citrus
hops
and
theres
a
couple
caramel
and
toffee
notes
but
i
want
more
this
certainly
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
cant
stand
up
to
brooklyns
other
fine
offerings
d
very
drinkable
and
crisp
it
had
a
somewhat
dark
amber
color
mostly
opaque
head
was
about
a
half
inch
thick
beige
and
bubbly
aroma
was
a
mix
sweet
malts
and
floral
hops
there
were
some
additional
earthy
sweetness
to
the
taste
which
was
similar
to
the
aroma
great
body
could
be
a
little
more
carbonated
but
not
that
noteworthy
great
anytime
beer
that
you
can
find
locally
assuming
you
live
in
the
nyc
area
pours
a
clear
amber
nice
dense
head
leaves
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
fresh
and
bready
with
some
raw
sugar
sweetness
coming
through
some
yeasty
fruitiness
biscuity
as
the
label
says
with
nice
caramel
overtones
clean
and
bitter
overall
with
good
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
decent
body
a
good
crisp
offering
d
a
nice
pale
ale
no
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
beer
the
drinkability
is
reduced
due
to
the
high
carbonation
best
before
october
2010
from
a
brooklyn
variety
pack
pours
a
dark
golden
color
34
of
head
which
dissipated
quickly
minor
lacing
but
its
there
very
low
carbonation
almost
a
sweet
flavor
and
a
bit
of
a
toasty
taste
a
decent
offering
from
brooklyn
but
not
my
favorite
i
poured
the
last
glass
from
the
growler
out
pretty
disappointed
but
not
a
terrible
brew
moreys
bottom
line
for
me
the
carbonation
is
what
keeps
this
ale
from
ranking
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorite
pales
that
being
said
it
is
nice
and
crisp
and
if
you
prefer
a
bitey
carbonation
this
might
be
a
could
choice
for
summer
bbqs
d
this
beer
is
so
dry
clean
tasty
and
delicate
that
it
begs
to
be
drank
im
really
liking
this
stuff
such
a
great
sessioner
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
noticeably
thick
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
less
fizzy
especially
for
the
style
i
wonder
about
the
freshness
on
this
beer
because
its
nothing
like
i
remember
having
it
out
of
the
bottle
last
summer
ill
try
it
again
but
for
this
pint
i
wasnt
a
fan
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
should
really
stand
out
with
food
maybe
a
steak
and
ale
pie
d
very
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
good
english
pale
personally
i
was
hoping
for
a
tiny
bit
more
of
hoppy
bitterness
o
its
drinkable
its
balanced
and
intriguing
with
its
earthy
aromas
definitely
something
id
like
to
drink
at
the
ballpark
or
the
backyard
drinkability
very
sessionable
as
all
english
pales
should
be
off
the
pour
a
2
finger
had
quickly
rises
and
fades
into
a
small
head
just
more
than
a
crown
but
laces
pretty
well
deep
transparent
brown
with
no
visible
carbonation
or
sediment
smell
is
a
strong
roasty
nutty
fruity
something
not
your
typical
smell
almost
reminds
me
of
marinara
sauce
honestly
taste
is
a
strong
earthy
and
slightly
hoppy
mix
that
goes
well
with
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
very
balanced
and
drinkable
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
amber
color
the
beer
poured
a
big
tan
fluffy
head
but
it
went
away
really
fast
the
lacing
though
was
good
the
beer
had
a
hoppy
smell
but
was
not
too
much
hopped
there
was
a
nice
malty
finish
to
the
beer
i
liked
the
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
the
grain
and
malt
flavors
overpower
the
hops
and
this
is
just
an
average
beer
which
goes
down
almost
watery
high
drinkability
but
just
not
a
taste
that
stands
out
this
is
an
average
beer
in
every
way
and
just
ok
pours
a
rich
brownish
copper
with
nice
white
head
fine
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
hints
of
biscuity
malt
and
is
slightly
fruity
and
herbal
very
subdued
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
plenty
of
biscuity
malt
some
lemon
slight
nuttiness
and
a
sweet
grassiness
all
pleasant
flavors
but
all
pretty
boring
it
carries
a
pretty
fair
amount
of
bitterness
that
leaves
me
feeling
like
this
beer
has
an
identity
crisis
i
find
that
this
taste
is
not
really
bold
enough
nor
clean
enough
for
me
to
considerate
it
anything
special
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
wonderfully
smooth
with
a
nice
balanced
finish
it
is
probably
this
beers
best
attribute
very
drinkable
but
i
think
i
would
much
prefer
a
well
made
lager
over
this
beer
in
almost
any
situation
not
bad
but
not
one
to
seek
out
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
each
sip
leaves
me
ready
for
another
this
would
make
a
good
goto
for
the
next
time
im
jonesing
for
an
english
ale
session
drinkability
good
and
very
drinkable
definitely
a
session
beer
still
a
decent
sessionable
brew
perhaps
for
another
season
ive
had
better
beers
from
this
brewer
without
doubt
and
in
my
part
of
the
world
its
a
little
pricey
i
bought
this
when
my
folks
came
over
bc
my
father
grew
up
in
brooklyn
during
the
1950s
and
was
a
dodgers
fan
not
one
of
the
best
beers
that
brooklyn
brewery
has
produced
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
so
it
is
worth
a
try
cheers
md
the
thinness
is
the
biggest
issue
alcohol
is
noticeable
and
dry
its
easy
to
drink
but
why
bother
a
little
light
on
the
mouthfeel
exceptionally
drinkable
i
could
see
kicking
these
back
one
after
another
watching
some
baseball
for
sure
aroma
is
smooth
and
nutty
with
toasted
malts
but
faint
flavor
is
clean
and
malty
as
expected
flavor
is
as
expected
malty
with
a
dry
and
grassy
hop
finish
some
buttery
and
sulfur
notes
exist
in
the
background
carbonation
is
high
but
pleasant
pretty
easy
drinking
but
overall
nothing
too
special
making
me
want
more
and
what
a
fantastic
label
love
the
baseball
sorry
i
know
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
beer
but
very
cool
d
oh
yeah
worthy
of
seving
at
ebbets
field
jackie
robinson
roy
campanella
carl
furillo
and
sandy
amoros
wouldve
crushed
a
round
overall
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
that
much
aroma
and
taste
were
off
to
me
and
the
metallic
aftertaste
finished
it
the
first
brooklyn
that
i
didnt
really
like
and
wouldnt
have
again
dont
recommend
rotation
avail
here
in
tx
but
one
is
enough
for
me
just
not
my
style
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
but
otherwise
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
anything
special
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
dreally
a
great
all
around
beer
maybe
the
fat
tire
of
the
the
east
as
my
wife
would
say
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
another
point
for
brooklyn
these
guys
continue
to
impress
me
i
tasted
this
one
side
by
side
with
brooklyns
east
india
and
i
think
i
prefer
this
one
actually
i
think
its
a
better
example
of
the
style
than
the
ipa
is
with
more
complexity
tasty
the
bottle
needs
to
be
updated
here
it
actually
says
pennant
55
on
it
now
pours
to
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
flavor
is
much
the
same
the
beer
is
rather
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
overall
it
is
rather
pleasant
i
would
not
say
no
to
this
one
if
offered
it
very
drinkable
an
excellent
session
beer
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
rich
amber
color
with
a
big
bubbly
head
ok
lacing
to
me
i
really
like
this
american
version
of
an
english
pale
ale
this
is
a
great
session
brew
to
me
goes
down
nice
an
easy
and
love
the
baseball
connection
too
drinkability
another
very
sessionable
biscuity
beer
i
could
have
three
a
lot
of
the
flavor
here
is
reminiscent
of
the
flavors
i
associate
with
abitas
beers
this
is
an
above
average
not
great
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
it
tastes
very
generic
and
bland
with
its
only
characters
being
generall
unpleasant
its
not
undrinkable
but
its
not
particularly
likeable
brooklyn
brews
some
far
better
beers
overall
not
bad
but
really
lacks
depth
easy
drinking
but
not
one
you
will
hunt
down
could
be
good
for
drinking
around
the
grill
while
you
wait
to
eat
but
thats
it
d
drinkable
through
and
through
drinks
like
a
pilsner
actually
with
light
malts
and
a
good
hop
character
received
as
a
gift
and
enjoyed
it
not
over
the
top
but
solid
in
its
style
not
very
exciting
but
not
bad
classic
english
maltiness
that
improves
with
warmth
nearblistering
tartness
on
the
edge
of
the
tongue
well
carbonated
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
enjoy
a
good
beer
for
a
session
or
even
to
pair
with
food
pork
with
applesauce
or
pizza
would
be
a
good
pair
pours
deep
amber
is
that
a
mosquito
in
there
with
a
finger
height
white
head
appears
to
be
a
rather
carbonated
head
leaves
some
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
more
like
chalk
marks
than
lace
though
smells
sweet
with
an
emphasis
on
caramel
slight
tang
in
the
nose
from
some
type
of
hop
taste
follows
the
nose
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
strange
aftertaste
must
be
from
the
malt
used
i
cant
place
the
exact
offness
of
it
this
has
a
nice
weighted
mouthfeel
to
it
not
too
heavy
and
certainly
not
too
light
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
sweet
malts
with
a
little
caramel
no
bitterness
in
the
smell
taste
is
biscuit
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
but
they
are
fairly
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
can
see
myself
having
several
of
these
overall
there
was
nothing
particulary
unappealing
about
this
beer
however
theres
a
way
to
go
before
it
should
be
called
above
average
d
this
is
a
average
english
pale
at
best
there
are
other
better
english
pales
that
i
would
rather
have
would
drink
again
though
if
given
to
me
dont
get
me
wrong
drinkability
i
would
go
back
to
this
again
and
again
i
wish
it
was
on
cask
in
my
neighborhood
more
often
ok
drinkability
i
didnt
find
this
one
to
be
very
good
to
be
honest
d
the
most
resounding
characteristic
of
brooklyn
pennant
ale
55
is
its
dry
fruity
tartness
it
is
tart
in
a
different
way
however
than
an
ipa
or
some
other
hopheavy
beer
is
tart
it
is
also
well
balanced
by
a
sweet
malt
presence
all
around
very
tasty
and
plenty
drinkable
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
theres
really
nothing
about
it
that
make
me
want
to
go
out
and
pay
for
this
beer
again
its
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
boring

very
simple

has
enough
to
keep
you
interested

the
brew
has
medium
body
and
avaerage
carbonation
a
solid
epa
but
nothing
to
knock
you
socks
off
tastes
much
as
it
smells
well
balanced
crisp
and
light
malt
starts
bready
with
light
fruit
nodes
moves
into
a
sweeter
middle
of
mild
caramel
and
toasted
whitebread
ends
with
a
combination
of
sweet
malt
and
light
bitterdry
hops
personally
brooklyn
pennatt
pale
ale
is
my
kind
of
beer
malty
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
beer
but
very
ordinary
the
light
mouthfeel
is
complimented
greatly
by
the
superior
carbonation
overall
a
refreshing
beer
relaxing
a
good
drinkable
serviceable
beer
one
i
would
gladly
sip
at
a
baseball
game
but
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
otherwise
d
quite
drinkable
dfw
seems
to
get
getting
more
and
more
brooklyn
brews
and
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
brooklyn
lager
in
my
opinion
great
brooklyn
offering
and
very
drinkable
in
the
tap
version
highly
recommend
d
a
very
nice
pale
ale
in
the
english
tradition
very
nicely
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
easy
to
drink
and
a
reasonable
level
of
alcohol
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
worth
trying
a
worthy
offering
from
brooklyn
i
would
enjoy
drinking
this
often
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
doesnt
do
anything
really
special
other
than
being
well
balanced
but
it
works
drinkability
a
darker
beer
thats
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
rival
to
beers
that
are
lighter
in
color
and
grainer
in
taste
not
complex
enough
to
be
a
sipping
beer
but
tasty
and
easy
enough
to
drink
to
be
a
good
session
drinks
alright
in
style
but
nothing
special
imo
poured
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
was
nice
with
subtle
hops
citrus
and
malts
taste
is
malty
hops
with
citrus
notes
bready
and
chewy
medium
bodied
and
tasty
could
be
a
good
session
beer
low
abv
was
nice
and
it
was
well
done
overall
go
pens
go
phish
perhaps
classifying
it
elsewhere
might
make
sense
drinkability
good
drinkability
and
representative
of
the
apa
style
a
nice
summer
beer
in
a
bottle
best
by
july
2009
it
had
a
dark
amber
color
in
my
pint
glass
with
a
mediumsized
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
with
some
sweetness
bscuittoast
taste
still
sweet
like
fruit
rather
dry
in
the
mouth
this
was
a
great
beer
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
d
very
drinkable
beer
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
great
for
a
session
thanks
sarah
decent
session
beer
but
not
one
to
go
out
of
ones
way
for
good
carbonation
and
very
sessionable
beer
i
would
drink
this
in
the
future
but
it
would
be
when
i
was
looking
for
an
amber
delicious
and
with
the
dry
finish
easy
to
quaff
the
hops
were
well
balanced
by
the
malts
refreshing
and
satisfying
on
a
hot
day
ill
be
having
this
again
overall
a
passable
beer
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
but
nice
to
put
back
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
would
drink
it
again
drinkability
high
but
taste
isnt
mindblowing
enough
to
drink
tons
the
fruitiness
is
a
little
jawtweaking
but
overall
a
solid
ale
a
pretty
solid
brew
d
i
couldnt
really
find
anything
bad
to
say
about
this
i
really
enjoyed
the
drinkability
and
the
way
the
ingredients
have
a
nice
cohesion
for
an
above
average
drinkability
could
be
a
bit
smoother
but
overall
not
a
bad
brew
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
in
common
brooklyn
lager
its
style
is
said
to
be
an
apa
it
seems
to
be
a
mild
ale
to
me
seems
much
more
like
an
epa
but
a
great
full
flavor
session
beer
not
for
me
though
one
is
enough
for
this
session
but
who
knows
how
ill
feel
in
the
future
this
a
good
summer
afternoon
drinker
if
icecold
however
it
isnt
one
that
i
would
search
out
again
d
this
is
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
lunch
or
enjoy
on
a
sunday
afternoon
there
is
nothing
here
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
very
solid
pale
ale
that
is
smooth
and
refreshing
d
a
very
nice
apa
quite
drinkable
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
a
pretty
onesided
sweet
malt
profile
still
a
nice
offering
from
brooklyn
this
would
be
a
highly
versatile
beer
for
a
lot
of
different
scenarios
if
you
can
find
it
it
goes
great
after
a
hot
summer
event
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
amber
with
little
head
white
that
dissipated
quickly
smell
malty
and
hoppy
fairly
floral
and
some
sweet
caramel
notes
as
well
taste
is
of
medium
body
fairly
malty
taste
and
medium
carbonation
fading
to
the
floral
and
hoppy
notes
at
the
end
well
balanced
hoppy
finish
not
teribly
complex
good
ale
to
have
around
good
bbq
beer
drinkable
because
it
was
light
and
did
taste
somewhat
better
as
it
warmed
might
have
been
served
overly
cold
ill
have
to
try
this
in
a
bottle
some
time
to
truly
make
up
my
mind
mt
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
i
would
call
it
medium
body
the
flavor
is
also
sweet
and
malty
a
little
bready
and
has
a
light
hop
finish
this
was
a
nice
little
brew
to
begin
the
2009
major
league
baseball
season
notes
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
and
it
is
far
superior
to
the
east
india
pale
ale
from
brooklyn
d
a
decent
apa
not
the
greatest
definately
not
the
worst
could
have
used
some
more
hops
and
flavor
i
dont
watch
baseball
but
if
i
did
i
can
imagine
id
want
to
drink
this
beer
d
ive
put
back
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
on
several
occasions
best
of
all
it
celebrates
the
dem
bums
finally
breaking
through
and
beating
them
yanks
reminds
me
more
of
an
english
style
pale
ale
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
the
name
is
fitting
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
brew
to
enjoy
at
a
game
with
a
couple
of
hot
dogs
damn
im
ready
for
baseball
season
it
tastes
zesty
as
well
wow
the
flavor
is
great
alot
of
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
crisp
with
little
to
no
sweetness
to
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
english
bitter
in
the
flavor
tasty
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
dry
finish
d
ive
said
in
the
past
im
not
a
bid
ipa
or
pale
ale
guy
so
this
is
not
the
most
exciting
and
not
the
most
boring
brew
ive
every
had
a
pretty
average
session
brew
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
poured
from
a
pale
color
as
expected
smelled
biscuity
with
moderate
hop
aroma
mildy
piney
and
grassy
taste
was
odd
to
me
very
sour
medium
to
light
in
body
with
very
little
carbonation
as
i
would
expect
on
cask
bitter
and
sour
on
the
finish
id
try
again
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
but
not
on
cask
average
beer
d
very
drinkable
would
go
nicely
with
meals
casual
consumption
or
session
this
would
be
a
great
ontap
keg
for
a
party
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
very
fizzy
with
a
mediumlight
body
tone
down
the
fizz
and
you
have
a
nicely
drinkable
quite
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
which
i
like
im
not
sure
where
the
flavor
went
on
this
one
the
taste
and
aftertaste
is
like
i
just
ate
some
beef
stew
ick
i
love
me
some
stew
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
it
the
honey
that
i
smelled
is
absent
as
there
isnt
an
ounce
of
sweetness
that
i
can
find
just
a
weird
bitter
meaty
flavor
this
is
weird
avoid
overall
a
decent
beer
with
some
nice
notes
but
nothing
memorable
to
make
me
want
to
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
seems
like
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
to
me
given
both
the
hop
and
the
malt
profile
that
being
said
its
good
for
what
it
is
a
dry
quenching
balanced
but
straightforward
brew
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
that
this
one
will
likely
hit
the
spot
high
drinkability
because
of
weak
flavor
but
i
could
have
sworn
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
the
other
times
ive
had
it
maybe
a
bad
batch
or
it
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
too
long
ill
rereview
it
sometime

above

great

not
a
stellar
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
but
consistent
head
no
apparent
lacing
and
the
beer
had
a
somewhat
flat
appearance
the
smell
was
impressive
with
subtle
fruity
elements
mixed
with
a
strong
malty
odor
the
hops
become
a
little
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
the
maltiness
remains
dominant
a
breadlike
taste
was
also
present
the
medium
body
was
appropriate
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
fizz
on
the
tongue
maybe
a
little
flat
but
not
terribly
so
overall
this
brooklyn
product
was
a
pretty
good
ale
notes
from

this
beer
pours
an
orangish
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
presents
a
bit
of
malt
and
an
even
lesser
amount
of
floral
hops
the
taste
brings
the
malt
to
the
forefront
with
a
nice
sweet
bready
taste
with
a
not
much
of
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
late
but
it
is
a
pale
ale
and
with
the
effervescence
steaming
through
the

ill
forgive
it
a
beer
worth
buying

may

ill
have
to
try
this
again
down
the
road
and
rereview
as
it
stands
overall
a
decent
beer
i
actually
enjoyed
it
better
out
of
the
bottle
than
the
glass
md
a
little
too
highly
carbonated
if
it
was
toned
down
a
little
it
would
be
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
despite
the
carbonation
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
to
it
good
beer
the
taste
is
sweetsour
fruit
fruit
that
has
gone
beyond
being
overripe
toasty
bread
a
hint
of
leaf
with
sour
fruit
in
the
finish
followed
by
toast
aftertaste
its
ightly
sweet
with
very
light
bitterness
it
seems
rather
english
and
particularly
like
whitbread
pale
ale
but
is
a
bit
bland
and
onedimensional
with
the
yeasty
sweetsour
fruit
quality
really
taking
over
after
a
few
sips
it
is
not
at
all
bad
though
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
its
got
just
the
right
flavor
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
you
can
think
about
it
if
you
want
to
and
you
wont
be
dissapointed
you
can
also
watch
the
sporting
event
of
your
choice
and
completely
forget
about
analyzing
this
beer
n
shit
meaning
that
this
beer
is
about
perfect
despite
what
folks
might
think
a
pale
ale
is
supposed
to
be
overall
this
beer
is
a
slight
letdown
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
beer
seems
quite
versatile
more
malt
based
beer
and
then
hop
based
but
im
a
little
unsure
about
the
sourness
toasty
malts
and
subtle
balancing
hops
makes
this
a
pretty
good
english
pale
ale
id
say
the
type
of
hop
used
or
something
doesnt
give
it
the
most
ideal
flavor
but
thats
just
a
personal
preference
its
well
crafted
without
any
off
flavors
try
it
for
yourself
recommended
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
at
5
20
abv
beyond
that
theres
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
its
weaker
than
i
remember
it
being
and
how
this
is
categorized
with
snpa
and
the
three
floyds
alpha
king
is
beyond
me
this
seems
more
like
an
enlgish
or
an
aforementioned
scotch
ale
and
probably
my
least
favorite
of
all
of
brooklyns
offerings
at
least
they
raised
enough
money
for
the
pee
wee
reese
and
jackie
robinson
statue
down
at
keyspan
park
very
run
of
the
mill
beer
hazy
amber
color
not
a
great
deal
of
hops
in
the
scent
or
taste
mostly
light
bodied
malts
i
agree
with
some
of
the
reviewers
who
have
described
a
metallic
flavor
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
low
abv
renders
this
drinkable
but
the
other
factors
limit
this
overall
i
enjoy
this
from
time
to
time
i
think
brooklyn
lager
is
better
and
their
specialties
like
the
monster
ale
are
amazing
i
would
get
it
again
though
not
in
any
rush
this
is
brooklyns
weakest
beer
i
mean
its
just
kinda
there
it
tastes
averagegood
it
smells
averagegood
its
just
kinda
there
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
in
purgatory
its
ok
but
then
again
so
is
alot
of
macro
brew
if
you
are
gonna
get
a
crooklyn
get
the
lager
or
octoberfest
or
brown
this
one
is
just
alright
drinkability
just
an
average
pale
ale
that
is
more
in
the
english
than
american
style
forgettable
a
very
safe
pale
ale
here
from
brooklyn
brewery
an
easy
drinker
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
but
nothing
that
makes
you
shout
out
that
this
is
a
great
beer
it
does
nothing
wrong
but
isnt
special
either
i
figured
with
the
reputation
this
brewery
has
it
would
be
a
tad
more
flavorful
out
of
my
bottle
this
one
was
a
classic
amber
color
a
feisty
pour
produced
a
billowing
khaki
head
an
inch
thick
that
settled
back
to
a
one
finger
cap
good
retention
of
this
cap
and
lacing
too
the
aroma
was
distinctly
caramel
malt
with
some
metallic
elements
as
well
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
at
first
just
enough
malt
and
hops
with
hints
of
citrus
quite
middle
of
the
road
and
uninspired
in
my
opinion
not
unpleasant
by
any
means
but
it
posses
little
distinguishing
elements
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
resiny
and
does
detract
from
my
opinion
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
the
body
medium
d
a
slightly
above
average
session
brew
not
much
to
it
and
this
brew
could
easily
be
better
the
feel
is
very
thick
and
creamy
dry
and
chewy
quite
formidable
its
a
terrific
allaround
drinking
experience
presentation
taste
aroma
the
taste
isnt
a
mindblower
but
a
very
solid
ale
bottle
is
labeled
brooklyn
pennant
ale
55
which
as
a
baseball
fan
i
think
is
a
pretty
cool
name
the
beer
is
alright
pours
an
amber
body
and
after
less
than
a
minute
is
topped
with
almost
no
head
halfway
through
i
looked
at
it
and
it
appeared
more
ruby
colored
caramel
malty
aroma
with
a
well
defined
malt
flavor
subtle
hops
in
the
finish
mediumbodied
for
whatever
reason
i
was
expecting
something
lighter
i
guess
the
label
had
me
thinking
summertime
sitting
in
the
sun
watching
baseball
etc
this
would
be
nice
during
the
fall
ok
so
they
won
the
pennant
in
the
fall
i
get
it
anyways
as
i
said
earlier
its
alright
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
great
ether
appearance
copper
in
color
one
finger
off
white
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
smell
nice
fruity
and
some
floral
hop
taste
a
bit
dry
a
nice
fruitiness
and
a
mediem
hop
presence
mouthfeel
lite
in
body
and
mediem
in
carbonation
drinkability
it
was
ok
in
a
varity
pack
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
its
own
solid
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
stood
out
either
also
like
the
fact
its
named
after
the
last
world
series
winner
in
brooklyn
back
in
1955
pours
an
alrady
sticky
two
finger
bone
white
head
the
cherry
wood
amber
color
almost
conceals
the
small
sluggish
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
aroma
has
a
strong
biscuity
malt
wheat
toast
with
a
splash
of
pine
jelly
the
tase
is
equally
inpressive
with
lots
of
crystal
toasted
malts
the
splash
of
minty
hops
with
the
englishy
malts
are
a
great
combo
that
add
to
the
refreshing
quality
of
this
beer
d
very
nice
beer
with
no
overpowering
tones
of
any
one
flavor
definately
worth
a
try
this
is
a
smooth
not
overly
crisp
slightly
toasted
beer
which
is
a
product
of
the
maris
otter
malts
there
are
some
grape
flavors
some
dry
florals
perhaps
a
bit
grainy
and
a
bit
chewy
the
grape
flavors
really
present
themselves
as
the
efforvesence
gives
way
to
a
flatter
more
settled
beer
the
dry
florals
are
right
up
there
with
the
grapes
the
beer
is
light
bodied
refreshing
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
slightly
nutty
aftertaste
and
maybe
some
dryish
nuttiness
in
the
finish
from
the
initial
pour
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
pretty
standard
fare
nothing
brilliant
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
grainy
with
a
very
light
whiff
of
floral
hops
there
is
a
surprising
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
for
summer
not
bad
but
not
outstanding
drinkability
like
pretty
much
all
of
brooklyns
beers
this
is
a
brew
that
takes
a
very
simple
style
and
simply
does
it
to
perfection
i
dont
like
it
quite
as
much
as
their
lager
but
for
a
nice
nottoocomplex
apa
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
ok
so
i
liked
this
beer
much
more
than
some
gorgeous
rich
brownamber
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
frothy
head
and
lacing
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
in
the
nose
for
me
the
taste
is
as
near
perfect
as
a
beer
can
bea
delicate
balance
of
rich
caramel
malt
balanced
with
a
subtle
crispness
from
multiple
hops
varieties
i
tend
to
judge
beers
first
by
how
much
i
enjoy
them
this
one
was
fantastic
top
to
bottom
the
last
little
bit
in
the
glass
even
warm
was
as
flavorful
as
the
first
truly
a
sessionstyle
beer
if
ever
there
was
one
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
this
has
become
my
goto
beer
for
a
barbeque
or
for
tailgating
at
yankee
stadium
another
solid
offering
fom
brooklyn
brewery
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
pale
ale
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
good
option
for
a
session
beer
recommended
a
decent
beer
great
for
pairing
with
outdoor
summer
grilling
a
solid
offering
from
brooklyn
great
beer
to
satisfy
on
a
hot
day
without
sacrificing
taste
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
one
finger

that
dissipates
quickly
with
light

behind

carmelized

fruit
malty
up
front
flavor
with
tea
lemon
caramel
fruity
yeast
mixed
in
with
a
dry
finish
high
carbonation
medium
body
this
is
a
mouth
cleansing
beer
with
a
smooth
finish
like
most
brooklyn
offerings
that
i
have
enjoyed
in
the
past
the
word
that
continually
comes
to
mind
is
balance
i
like
the
ode
to
their
brooklyn
dodgers
and
appreciation
for
their
fine
city
this
is
a
nice
springearly
summer
beer
and
i
would
certainly
pick
up
again
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aromas
seemed
a
bit
off

none
the
less
d
a
good
solid
ale
less
hoppy
than
most
apas
but
still
a
nice
drinkable
beer
notes
my
opinion
is
that
this
is
a
solid
beer
staple
for
the
summer
time
and
surprisingly
i
liked
it
quite
a
lot
good
balance
fine
taste
standard

flavor
wise
the
bitterness
stands
out
though
not
overwhelmingly
so
a
touch
of
malty

caramel
like
decent
bodythe
malt
profile
seems
to
hold
it
all
together
while
i
am
not
a
huge
plain
ole
pale
ale
fan
i
could
do
this
on
a
regualr
basis
good
beer
all
around
d
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
a
good
warm
weather
beer
i
think
more
carbonation
would
help
this
one
out
alot
and
make
it
much
easier
to
drink
although
i
had
no
problems
downing
this
bottle
quickly
and
could
have
easily
drank
more
my
second
beer
while
at
the
milky
way
in
jp
wanted
to
grab
a
nice
beer
to
accompany
my
bacon
cheeseburger
and
this
was
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
small
white
head
and
sort
of
looked
like
a
pilsner
had
the
same
yellow
color
but
looked
a
bit
thicker
and
had
much
less
carbonation
nothing
noticeable
with
the
smell
taste
was
good
though
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
expected
so
it
didnt
quite
fit
my
definition
of
a
pale
ale
smooth
drinking
this
a
beer
that
i
would
have
like
to
have
a
few
more
of
that
night
d
pennant
ale
is
a
wellbalanced
beer
but
not
sure
that
i
would
call
it
an
apa
its
more
in
line
with
an
english
pale
ale
but
its
still
not
the
best
still
this
beer
is
decently
drinkable
more
flavor
would
help
things
out
a
bit
though
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
with
an
oily
stickylipped
finish
excellent
drinkability
okay
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
not
a
bad
pale
ale
good
amount
of
flavor
and
well
rounded
balance
there
are
better
examples
out
there
that
are
more
readily
available
but
i
would
never
turn
one
of
these
down
notes
pretty
simple
and
very
sessionable
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
and
very
different
from
the
hoppy
american
style
im
used
to
the
malt
sweetness
gives
the
beer
a
richness
that
is
somewhat
lacking
in
many
session
ales
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
good
tasting
beer
and
i
could
have
a
couple
per
sitting
brooklyns
apa
aint
bad
but
its
far
from
outstanding
a
decent
sessionable
beer
with
some
flavors
d
definitely
one
of
the
dryest
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
crisp
and
enjoyable
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
d
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
it
isnt
a
standout
either
i
expect
a
bit
more
vibrancy
from
an
apa
in
my
opinion
the
best
drink
the
brooklyn
brewery
has
to
offer
is
the
black
chocolate
stout
stu
overall
this
was
this
weekends
beer
to
sip
while
getting
crap
done
around
the
house
brew
i
like
the
subdued
hops
and
the
butterscotch
flavors
just
malty
and
hoppy
enough
to
be
flavorful
yet
stay
mellow
at
the
same
time
overall
a
great
summer
ale
classic
no
gimmicks
wellrounded
avoid
food
thats
too
spicy
but
this
is
great
with
summer
fare
as
well
as
a
good
concoction
of
red
beans
rice
med
effervescence
light
to
medium
body
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
and
a
slightly
crisp
finish
overall
good
stuff
but
would
really
have
liked
this
if
it
werent
quite
so
hoppy
and
more
of
the
notes
that
i
smelled
had
actually
gotten
to
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
relatively
tasty
brew
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
bit
more
flavorful
and
robust
than
some
other
apas
but
i
say
that
as
a
good
thing
another
nice
brew
from
brooklyn
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
feels
like
i
imagineive
never
had
onea
cask
ale
would
feel
moderate
to
low
in
carbonation
with
a
light
medium
body
leaves
a
somewhat
slick
feeling
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
beer
that
again
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
sure
its
okay
but
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
type
of
beer
this
isnt
one
that
i
can
sit
back
and
drink
all
night
too
much
sweetness
not
enough
to
balance
it
out
not
bad
though
i
think
id
like
to
do
this
one
over
bass
d
not
bad
i
would
drink
more
if
i
had
them
though
i
might
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
buy
more
a
solid
beer
but
not
very
exciting
dont
get
me
wrong
many
people
are
not
out
for
excitement
this
hits
the
middle
of
the
road
nicely
a
respectable
beer
pours
a
slighly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
fluffy
head
after
a
hard
pour

on
the
glass
the
smell
is

biscuitybready
malt
dry
grapes
leafy
hops
and
a
buttery
grainy
aroma
the
taste
is
bready
malt
with
a
metallic
twang
has
a
slight
sweet
fruitiness
followed
by
a
bitteringdrying
hop
presence
the
feel
is
thin
and
not
very
crisp
finishes
slighly
bitter
a
decent
brew
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
dont
see
myself
seeking
out
again
not
a
runofthemill
pale
ale
by
any
means
but
im
finding
it
a
little
thin
though
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
one
i
probably
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
either

colored

ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
fairly
mild
mostly
malt
comes
through
the
flavor
is
kind
of
a
mess
some
metallic
hops
some
caramel
malt
and
some
diacetyl
stand
out
is
it
bad
no
but
i
dont
care
much
for
it
its
more
of
an
english
pale
ale
than
american
a
bit
better
than
average
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
light
head
that
went
away
quickly
it
smells
of
clean
hops
with
a
hint
of
a
malty
background
the
beer
has
an
initial
pleasing
hop
bitterness
that
is
followed
quickly
by
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
it
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
and
goes
down
quickly
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
taste
is
a
little
lighter
than
what
i
expected
but
theres
good
notes
of
caramel
malt
bread
a
little
roastiness
and
some
bitterish
hop
flavour
that
does
some
balancing
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
is
medium
and
it
finishes
slightly
bready
slightly
bitter
and
at
the
end
a
bit
watery
pretty
good
stuff
and
would
be
better
if
it
hadnt
lost
all
its
flavour
at
the
end
still
id
drink
it
aagin
no
problem

although
with
a
bit
of
egg
aroma
nice
taste
not
strong
and
hoppy
more
like
an
english
pub
ale
as
opposed
to

of

overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
when
i
poured
this
one
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
i
was
in
for
since
i
had
no
idea
of
the
style
im
still
not
sure
its
thin
and
watery
not
bad
just
kind
of
insubstantial
grainy
and
toasted
malts
and
undetermined
hop
bitterness
are
about
all
there
seems
to
be
in
the
flavor
department
fairly
well
carbonated
but
lacking
the
backbone
to
maintain
a
cap
of
foam
or
lace
almost
like
keg
beer
poured
into
a
red
solo
cup

a
bad

but
nothing

taste

biscuity
ending
slightly

light
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
good
second
beer
from
the
variety
12
pack
and
both
very
good
is
some
zesty
hop
in
the
aftertaste
i
already
just
have
one
more
sip
left
and
im
hesitant
to
take
it
for
then
it
will
be
all
gone
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
if
anyone
can
help
orient
me
to
the
flavors
here
i
would
appreciate
it
the
overall
taste
is
great
with
excellent
mouth
feel
the
after
taste
had
a
strange
hint
of
something
that
i
cant
describe
it
wasnt
bad
just
different
i
like
this
brew
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
think
you
could
drink
several
of
these
brews
in
an
afternoon
and
really
enjoy
them
first
i
have
to
qualify
my
review
by
saying
i
had
a
few
of
these
at
a
local
bar
on
tap
but
only
available
in
plastic
pint
cups
so
judging
color
and
lacing
among
other
things
is
kind
of
tough
but
who
knows
when
i
will
see
this
again
on
tap
around
here
even
in
the
cup
this
stuff
exhibited
a
fair
offwhite
head
over
what
appeared
to
be
a
fairly
clear
medium
copper
color
brew
the
aroma
was
mild
but
gave
off
some
malt
almost
a
brown
bread
scent
the
flavor
was
instantly
gratifying
a
bit
creamy
with
a
peppery
crisp
carbonation
and
sweet
biscuit
malt
surprisingly
i
dont
find
much
in
the
way
of
hops
going
on
here
but
what
there
is
would
be
on
the
herbal
side
fairly
dry
all
in
all
a
decent
blend
and
a
welcomed
sight
compared
to
all
the
other
macros
on
tap
at
the
bar
that
night
it
certainly
is
drinkable
but
the
dry
quality
probably
wouldnt
suit
that
purpose
as
much
as
others
by
my
tastes
definitely
deserves
a
try
and
should
be
much
more
than
serviceable
to
all
another
brooklyn
success
m
d
a
bit
watery
overall
not
bad
but
lacking
a
bit
in
body
certainly
not
a
bad
ale
but
not
really
calling
out
for
more
brooklyn

herbal
hop
presence
and
a
nice
freshly
baked
bread
feel
flavor
is
solid
overall
a
malt
leaning
apa
the
finish
is
a
little
harsh
with
a
dry
thinness
it
leaves
a
good
everday
drinker
a
little
heavy
for
an
apa
but
pretty
good
overall
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
a
very
earthy
malty
pale
ale
and
is
easily
on
the
fence
from
becoming
a
dry
brown
ale
a
decent
package
overall
the
quality
is
there
but
personally
it
doesnt
really
blow
my
skirt
up
pours
a
clear
amber
with
almost
no
head
nose
is
a
little
nutty
a
little
sugary
sweet
flavor
is
slightly
meaty
medium
body
long
staying
power
of
hops
in
the
mouth
though
mild
feel
is
thin
with
bubble
very
drinkable
yes
a
stable
pale
ale
but
nothing
really
that
fantastic
might
work
good
as
a
session
beer
but
still
there
are
greater
out
there
maybe
this
one
is
old
not
impressed
this
was
the
first
brooklyn
offering
that
i
had
its
started
a
relationship
that
has
raised
brooklyn
to
one
of
my
favorites
lots
of
great
options
final
thoughts

its
an
ok
beer
one
is
about
it
for
me
brewed
with
scottish
maris
otter
malts
12
oz
bottle
with
707
notched
sampled
on
8107
the
beer
is
lightlyhazed
dark
amber
with
low
carbonation
and
has
a
finger
of
yellowed
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
rich
dark
and
vinous
in
the
nose
with
a
backing
of
earthyfloral
hops
good
but
not
very
strong
on
the
palate
it
is
vinous
and
bready
with
toasted
malts
chocolate
some
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
hop
side
of
the
equation
there
are
greenfloral
and
pineyearthy
flavors
and
a
mild
bitterness
that
brings
the
beer
together
the
body
is
medium
and
wellcarbonated
smooth
drying
and
a
bit
numbing
and
both
the
malts
and
hops
contribute
to
the
medium
finish
overall
its
tasty
not
too
complex
and
comes
across
as
a
light
us
strong
ale
a
nice
easydrinking
beer
that
goes
great
with
food
in
my
opinion
a
must
try
for
british
ale
lovers
brooklyn
brew
fans
and
even
belgian
lovers
who
crave
complexity
brooklyn
pennant
ale
55
is
disappointing
on
the
pour
and
doesnt
improve
much
throughout
consumption
the
brew
is
a
bronze
color
with
little
head
at
most
one
finger
despite
an
aggressive
pour
there
is
a
sweet
maltiness
in
the
nose
this
continues
to
the
taste
which
exhibits
a
toasted
fruity
flavor
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
there
is
an
unfortunate
sourness
at
the
finish
that
further
detracts
from
the
taste
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
want
to
drink
again
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
burnt
orange
with
a
thin
1
finger
head
the
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
and
left
only
a
very
thin
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
wheat
bread
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
was
malty
and
very
slightly
sweet
felt
good
in
the
mouth
no
extreme
flavors
or
feelings
coated
nicely
very
good
going
down
honestly
not
fan
of
brooklyn
brews
so
went
in
not
expecting
to
like
all
that
much
and
not
blown
away
asked
bartender
what
this
one
was
all
about
and
described
as
hoppy
just
didnt
see
it
d
the
greatest
thing
that
stands
out
is
this
beers
ability
to
balance
malt
and
hop
while
keeping
both
sides
from
being
too
overpowering
a
quality
american
pale
ale
id
say
and
very
drinkable
but
doesnt
overly
impress
me
either
still
an
easy
sipper
that
id
take
over
a
lot
of
others
im
not
that
experienced
with
pale
ales
so
i
was
surprised
to
smell
and
taste
tropical
fruit
on
the
first
sip
it
doesnt
last
long
and
quickly
turns
to
malt
but
it
was
an
interesting
twist
on
well
beer
in
general
the
novelty
of
fruity
estery
beer
kept
me
sipping
away
appearance
was
also
good
opaque
tan
with
a
persistent
creamy
head
good
drinking
sampled
as
pennant
ale
the
beer
is
a
bright
orangeamber
color
with
a
medium
thick
fizzy
head
that
burns
off
pretty
quickly
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bready
malt
with
some
hops
thrown
in
mediumbodied
with
a
sweet
malt
character
at
first
followed
quickly
by
a
moderate
bitterness
some
sweet
toffee
is
present
as
well
but
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
vanilla
the
finish
is
piney
hops
with
a
shortlived
sweetness
on
the
back
end
average
pours
a
fourfinger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear

flavor

brooklyn
pennant

pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
mocha
colored
head
leaving
generous
lacing
around
the
glass
very
malty
nose
with
some
roasting
evident
there
is
the
essences
of
marshmallow
and
fresh
yeast
wafting
from
the
glass
welcoming
taste
of
warm
and
moderately
roasted
malts
unctuous
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
this
brew
is
an
enjoyable
and
rewarding
libation
crisp
somewhat
lean
and
refreshingly
effervescent
may
i
say
batter
up
pours
a
light
orange
with
half
a
finger
of
head
the
scent
is
laced
with
hard
biscuit
and
buttery
malts
with
some
interesting
woody
hops
the
taste
gives
more
of
the
same
im
enjoying
buttery
scones
really
not
a
bready
taste
but
a
harder
biscuit
and
the
hops
are
woody
slightly
earthy
and
lightly
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
carbonation
is
perfect
in
this
beer
it
dances
through
my
mouth
and
goes
down
cleanly
leaving
a
great
aftertaste
all
said
i
enjoyed
it
fully
though
perhaps
the
hops
were
not
as
assertive
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
an
apa
picked
up
the
pennant
ale
55
in
brooklyns
party
pack
but
ive
seen
the
pennant
ale
in
stores
all
around
new
york
poured
out
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
thin
head
and
not
too
impressive
on
the
smell
already
smells
heavily
of
malts
taste
was
a
little
powerful
on
malts
there
were
hints
of
some
fruits
but
lacking
a
hops
balance
to
mellow
out
the
malts
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
though
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
but
the
malty
sweetness
would
eventually
slow
me
down
overall
i
would
say
this
brew
is
a
bit
out
of
place
as
an
american
pale
ale
the
word
unbalanced
comes
to
mind
picked
up
in
ohio
recently
in
the
brooklyn
party
pack
served
in
a
pint
from
brown
bottle
pours
a
nice
amber
brown
with
a
cream
like
finger
thick
head
very
nice
malty
fruity
smell
with
inviting
hop
arouma
taste
of
sweet
biscuity
malt
then
breaking
down
to
a
citrusy
hop
flavor
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hop
this
a
good
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
available
further
west
drinkability
definatly
a
very
drinkable
apa
with
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
good
flavor
profile
malts
mix
nicely
with
the
hops
to
make
a
juicy
session
ale
with
complexity
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
copper
amber
a
half
inch
head
down
to
a
thin
foam
with
scant
lacing
the
aroma
is
similarly
scant
not
much
but
a
faint
biscuit
malt
and
some
fruitiness
and
a
buttery
diacetyl
the
taste
is
much
the
same
but
much
more
assertive
with
a
british
character
to
it
almost
and
so
while
the
mouth
is
quite
nice
good
body
and
a
fine
carbonation
it
almost
screams
for
cask
conditioning
now
that
would
be
a
tasty
beer
as
it
is
its
pretty
stock
but
still
tasty
and
a
decent
session
beer
for
watchin
the
game
decent
mouthfeel
not
an
overall
bad
experience
but
ive
had
better
d
despite
some
shortcomings
this
was
still
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
a
tad
bit
less
carbonation
and
it
would
go
down
even
easier
overall
a
fairly
disappointing
beer
from
a
great
brewery
a
shame
to
call
this
one
a
pale
ale
we
all
know
that
brooklyn
can
produce
some
phenomenal
beers
its
just
a
shame
that
most
of
their
standard
line
up
is
this
bland
and
boring
i
guess
you
have
to
appease
the
masses
not
just
the
beer
geeks
here
to
pay
the
bills
d
goes
down
very
easily
but
the
taste
just
isnt
there
i
cant
see
myself
getting
another
one
of
these
i
may
not
finish
this
one
d
the
sweetness
and
crispness
make
this
a
nice
option
im
going
for
another
right
now
not
a
bad
pale
ale
and
not
a
bad
beer
overall
however
it
doesnt
fit
my
image
of
the
style
which
i
usually
like
to
be
a
bit
more
hopfilled
than
this
presented
itself
to
be
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
having
some
of
their
other
great
beers
better
than
some
but
not
up
near
the
top
this
is
a
fairly
wellbalanced
apa
that
doesnt
try
to
be
too
hop
happy
or
complex
its
just
an
easy
drinker
a
nice
balance
between
the
breadlike
malts
and
floral
somewhat
herbal
hops
finish
is
not
too
dry
either
this
is
a
consummate
session
beer
and
great
for
a
warm
summer
evening
confusing
beer
but
maybe
the
sour
twinge
on
the
after
taste
throws
the
whole
thing
off
i
dont
think
its
going
south
and
may
have
been
intentional
but
didnt
sit
well
with
me
one
and
done
pleasant
beer
nice
full
smooth
flavor
but
too
much
of
a
bitter
linger
aftertaste
for
me
pours
a
nice
amberred
color
made
with
maris
otter
malts
nice
thick
head
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
and
beckons
within
taste
is
somewhat
thin
at
first
but
then
explodes
into
a
nice
malty
finish
almost
toasted
its
somewhat
slightly
smoky
as
well
not
too
bad
for
a
pale
ale
its
more
malty
than
hoppy
sessionable
i
believe
it
deserves
a
decent
rating
for
that
alone
drinkability
oh
oh
i
say
this
reminds
me
of
the
acme
pale
ale
i
had
earlier
today
i
cant
help
but
imagine
this
would
be
a
real
treat
on
cask
once
again
i
am
impressed
with
brooklyn
brewing
they
make
a
very
nice
quality
product
light
to
medium
body
some
grainyness
and
a
bit
of
cloyingness
easy
to
drinkjust
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
d
ive
had
better
apas
but
this
one
is
doable
id
really
like
to
see
the
carbonation
kicked
up
a
bit
and
a
touch
more
diversity
in
the
malt
character
fair
has
the
typical
golden
yellow
ale
color
not
much
of
a
head
aroma
is
pleasant
and
inviting
with
a
strong
fruity
hint
flavor
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
just
a
whisper
of
hop
bitterness
this
ale
is
very
smooth
but
just
a
little
bit
on
the
watery
side
a
good
summer
beer
little
wonder
its
name
is
a
celebration
of
baseball
this
is
a
pale
ale
for
octoberfest
fans
the
malt
flavors
had
a
real
munich
connection
for
me
but
the
bitterness
and
grapefruit
grounds
this
in
the
new
world
dthis
is
a
decent
apa
nothing
earthshaking
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
generous
head
the
smell
is
deliciously
malty
with
a
hint
of
lighter
nutlike
almond
or
peanut
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
seems
to
encompass
the
whole
palate
darker
malts
are
most
apparent
and
their
taste
lingers
for
minutes
after
the
beer
has
been
swallowed
a
bit
of
a
roastyness
as
well
going
down
there
is
a
terrific
amount
of
carbonationnot
too
over
bearing
but
still
keeping
it
lively
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
ale
and
true
to
name
it
hearkens
back
to
older
more
traditional
ales
d
its
just
good
enough
to
rate
good
i
think
this
one
is
meant
to
be
drank
right
out
of
the
bottle
which
would
kick
the
drinkability
up
a
notch
smooth
and
medium
bodied
this
ale
goes
down
easily
could
be
a
session
brew
for
certain
pretty
copper
color
nice
clarity
but
the
tannish
head
dissipates
rapidly
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
a
solid
maltiness
and
caramel
balanced
by
a
light
citrusy
hop
the
flavor
is
good
but
has
some
tealike
notes
and
there
is
some
tannin
mouthpuckeriness
evident
mostly
the
flavor
seems
to
start
with
a
solid
maltiness
that
rapidly
dries
up
and
blends
with
hop
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
tea
again
lemon
and
a
little
medicinal
notes
not
bad
but
not
great
either
the
neck
collar
says
it
allits
all
in
the
malts
extremely
drinkable
but
would
i
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
pours
ruby
amber
little
to
no
head
smells
like
a
cross
between
warm
pabst
and
maybe
sierra
nevada
the
first
sip
was
hard
the
soapy
aftertaste
kind
of
put
me
off
but
after
a
few
sips
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
not
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
something
i
would
seek
out
but
alright
theres
nothing
remarkable
about
this
its
average
across
the
board
cheers2beers
drinkability
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easily
i
really
like
this
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
inspired
by
far
my
corniest
review
yet
that
aside
this
was
an
excellent
mixbalance
of
caramelized
malts
and
subtle
hops
just
right
could
easily
see
this
being
mistaken
for
an
esb
would
go
great
with
a
big
greasy
super
thin
pie
slice
just
cheese
kudos
to
brooklyn
for
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
very
enjoyable
recommended
this
brew
pours
to
a
copper
color
with
a
fair
sized
light
tan
head
that
has
some
retention
that
left
some
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
odd
not
in
a
bad
way
as
i
am
picking
up
some
different
fruit
like
flavors
a
little
too
sweet
malt
scent
and
maybe
a
little
to
much
butter
let
me
say
this
it
is
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
just
not
real
good
imo
the
taste
also
while
being
good
seems
lackluster
as
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
buttery
flavor
that
seems
to
dominate
and
really
seems
to
stick
around
the
finish
that
surprisingly
seems
to
be
very
unbitter
is
more
metallic
in
nature
overall
i
would
classify
this
brew
as
a
slight
disappointment
for
me
i
think
that
it
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
but
i
would
grab
others
first
for
a
session
one
of
the
weaker
beers
in
brooklyns
line
up
d
not
badbut
not
great
not
a
beer
you
have
to
choke
down
decent
epa
i
mean
apa
i
would
have
to
say
the
taste
consists
of
basic
beer
flavors
no
complexity
or
anything
really
interesting
again
not
bad
but
nothing
to
cheer
about
kind
of
a
blah
lingering
aftertaste
quite
watery
in
the
mouth
with
very
inoffensive
carbonation
not
enough
really
easy
to
put
down
but
thats
about
it
im
not
yearning
for
more
the
mouthfeel
watery
one
of
these
is
my
limit
a
flat
pour
possibly
due
to
the
107
bb
date
still
that
heavy
flushed
amber
that
i
remember
clean
crisp
on
my
nose
quite
doughy
sweet
initially
the
backwash
keeps
me
constantly
gulping
nice
mildquite
mild
actually
easy
satisfying
a
staple
in
every
sense
its
a
decent
basic
englishstyle
pale
ale
not
really
what
i
would
expect
from
this
brewery
ive
had
several
others
from
it
and
have
been
impressed
it
does
have
a
nice
balance
and
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
nothing
really
makes
this
one
stand
out
as
anything
special
poured
a
decent
amber
with
a
big
fizzy
head
smell
was
more
malt
then
hops
but
still
not
at
all
bad
had
a
bit
of
a
grassy
tinge
to
it
the
taste
was
about
the
same
decent
for
a
apa
but
not
really
my
cup
of
beer
too
much
malts
which
through
off
the
balance
for
me
but
not
a
bad
brew
drinkabilitynice
and
agreeable
id
certainly
drink
this
in
the
future
i
got
this
pint
at
malones
in
lexington
va
it
poured
a
deep
brown
there
was
about
two
fingers
of
head
that
was
very
fluffy
there
was
a
lot
of
lace
that
was
also
very
fluffy
the
retention
was
also
solid
the
smell
was
very
malty
with
not
much
else
to
it
the
taste
had
a
coffee
flavor
this
all
combined
for
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
good
brew
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
a
ring
is
maintianed
but
otherwise
the
frostoness
of
the
beer
is
gone
after
the
first
minute
a
mlaty
smell
with
a
nutty
malty
taste
no
hops
really
present
at
all
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
definitely
saving
a
few
for
my
friends
12
oz
bottle
the
brew
is
a
brilliantly
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
ivory
head
over
top
the
head
falls
to
a
solid
coating
over
top
and
a
decent
carbonation
is
seen
in
the
brew
the
brew
looks
like
it
is
glowing
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
inhaling
over
the
glass
i
find
lots
of
toasted
and
bready
malt
with
a
mild
caramel
underneath
the
hops
come
across
as
more
earthy
in
nature
they
blend
nicely
with
the
toasted
character
of
the
malt
a
sip
brings
me
a
good
toastyness
with
a
raisin
fruityness
as
well
as
some
bready
sweetness
it
is
a
nice
combination
a
mild
earthy
hop
hits
more
on
the
finish
along
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
very
mild
carbonation
it
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
in
there
to
balance
it
out
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
even
though
it
is
not
traditional
for
a
pale
ale
of
any
flavor
that
i
know
i
think
they
work
well
together
its
like
a
pale
ale
with
some
special
b
or
aromatic
in
there
while
some
brooklyn
beer
is
little
better
than
average
most
of
what
ive
had
lately
has
been
very
good
unfortunately
pennant
ale
55
falls
into
the
former
camp
this
bottle
is
still
a
few
months
away
from
its
best
by
date
so
age
cant
be
a
factor
my
suggestion
for
what
its
worth
is
to
start
over
and
come
up
with
a
beer
that
is
worthy
of
such
a
great
name
and
a
great
label
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
taste
d
a
good
apa
less
hoppy
than
i
expected
good
use
of
malt
very
drinkable
ill
pick
up
another
when
i
get
the
opportunity
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
medium
carbonation
with
a
fairly
smooth
finish
i
doubt
i
would
ever
seek
this
one
out
again
cheers
had
a
12oz
bottle
of
the
new
pennant
ale
was
just
about
ready
to
hit
the
freshness
date
should
have
looked
before
i
bought
it
had
a
decent
complex
hop
aroma
but
really
didnt
translate
well
into
the
overall
taste
was
an
overall
good
pale
ale
however
i
think
i
am
growing
out
of
them
need
a
little
bit
more
hop
punch
worth
a
shot
and
i
am
definelty
going
to
try
a
fresher
one
in
the
near
future
the
drinkability
id
good
to
better
goes
down
quite
easy
mk
d
i
can
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
a
good
malty
session
choice
even
if
i
will
probably
confuse
it
with
their
lager
in
the
dusty
storage
bins
in
my
brain
d
not
a
great
pa
but
definitely
drinkable
fittingly
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
baseball
games
or
session
drinking
this
beer
pours
clear
orange
with
a
fluffy
lasting
white
head
minimal
hop
aroma
some
light
grains
this
doesnt
get
ones
hopes
up
but
this
beer
turns
out
to
be
well
puttogether
its
very
different
from
what
youd
expect
from
an
american
style
pale
ale
but
its
quite
good
nonetheless
fairly
light
dry
and
clean
with
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
just
balanced
by
brisk
carbonation
and
mild
hops
doesnt
compare
to
other
apas
but
on
its
own
merit
this
is
a
fine
beer
pours
a
bright
copper
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
hops
and
generalized
sweetness
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
good
balance
of
the
malts
clean
finish
with
a
slight
aftertaste
of
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
well
balanced
very
drinkable
a
great
session
brew
for
watching
a
ballgame
etc
light
body
easy
session
drinking
brew
but
carbonation
is
a
bit
heavy
also
a
bit
clean
perhaps
not
malty
enough
this
one
is
not
bad
but
like
many
others
have
said
before
me
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
particular
way
worth
a
try
but
only
slightly
above
average
pretty
decent
stuff
not
writing
home
to
tell
mom
about
it
but
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
typical
golden
copper
hue
with
waining
retentiona
nd
lacing
a
typical
maltiness
and
citrus
hops
aroma
and
flavor
moderately
estery
and
fruity
bready
and
yeasty
the
body
just
doesnt
really
pull
the
flavors
and
textures
together
lightly
undermalted
doesnt
allow
the
fullness
or
breadiness
to
bond
the
flavors
and
unify
the
beer
but
quality
and
nice
nevertheless
safe
and
a
bit
banal
over
all
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
pale
ale
but
is
a
good
session
ale
none
the
less
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
brooklyn
pennant
ale
55
at
sparrow
wine
liquor
co
in
hoboken
a
very
very
beerfriendly
place
with
good
prices
came
home
cracked
open
a
bottle
poured
into
an
oldstyle
mug
that
showed
off
a
nice
coppery
color
head
was
light
and
thin
but
the
carbonation
reminded
me
of
a
lager
or
pilsner
i
wondered
if
this
was
a
lagered
ale
or
some
such
smells
great
a
lot
of
malt
and
earth
to
go
with
the
hops
first
mouthful
reminded
me
of
a
scotch
ale
with
some
good
malty
flavors
the
hops
balance
it
out
nicely
especially
after
the
beer
settles
down
a
bit
good
overall
mouthfeel
you
definitely
know
somethings
hitting
all
your
tastebuds
not
a
very
heavy
beer
however
which
makes
it
quite
drinkable
id
be
very
selective
pairing
this
one
with
food
because
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
great
with
simple
fare
but
could
clash
with
more
complex
dishes
i
dont
know
if
pennant
ale
55
is
a
home
run
per
se
because
it
wouldve
been
a
five
across
the
board
but
its
very
much
a
tworbi
double
a
middark
gold
with
the
big
head
this
beer
takes
a
second
to
warm
up
get
its
balance
i
first
tasted
more
malt
than
hops
but
after
a
bit
the
hops
came
to
the
fore
very
sessionable
with
a
real
full
mouthfeel
i
would
bring
this
beer
to
a
bbq
where
i
wanted
a
food
friendly
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
d
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sittin
and
sippin
a
few
pint
at
barleys
in
greenville
sc
d
it
is
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
but
is
lacking
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
before
logging
on
to
the
site
and
seeing
the
description
i
really
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
was
trying
to
be
a
decent
brew
over
all
but
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
like
brooklyn
beers
a
lot
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
great
apas
out
there
snpa
anchor
smutty
3f
in
the
same
price
range
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
tot
his
one
but
its
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
not
on
par
with
brooklyns
lager
or
bigger
beers
comments
i
enjoyed
this
but
am
curious
whether
the
sour
taste
was
intentional
or
the
result
of
improper
storage
at
the
distributorretailer
as
i
drank
the
bottle
the
sour
taste
became
less
evident
seems
almost
more
an
esb
to
me
but
it
pours
a
medium
amber
color
moderate
to
slight
head
retention
aroma
is
very
light
i
dont
get
much
out
of
it
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
earthy
hops
mouthfeel
is
okay
drinkablity
is
okay
too
not
outstanding
but
not
bad
at
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
due
to
its
good
balance
pours
with
a
teacopper
color
with
little
carbonation
has
a
thin
lace
of
head
with
a
little
more
clinging
to
the
sides
smells
similar
to
a
macro
lager
with
a
slight
roasted
and
malty
smell
feels
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
a
little
fizziness
it
tastes
malty
and
goes
down
smooth
it
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
the
aftertaste
its
is
quite
mild
this
is
a
smooth
beer
the
has
an
awesome
smooth
and
malty
feel
to
it
ill
most
likely
have
this
again
md
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
to
medium
side
well
carbonated
and
clean
defintelty
drinkable
in
my
opinoin
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
before
and
will
continue
to
especialy
in
the
summer
months
overall
an
average
apa
i
would
have
prefered
a
bit
more
hop
rusted
amber
color
with
a
medium
foamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
after
a
minute
not
too
much
remains
of
the
head
and
the
lacing
is
weak
the
aroma
is
floral
and
bright
with
a
grainy
edge
to
it
taste
is
a
bit
thick
with
tons
of
a
biscuit
flavor
in
there
a
bit
of
diacetyl
comes
along
with
the
huge
biscuity
taste
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
as
well
as
a
bit
grassy
and
also
a
bit
metallic
the
body
is
super
rich
which
could
be
good
for
some
beers
but
its
way
too
much
for
this
simplistic
offering
esp
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
gets
cloying
fairly
early
not
really
too
drinkable
disappointing

update
had
again
on
tap
very
malty
and
sweet
remains
very
good
notched
as
best
by
april
2006
pours
quite
a
pretty
rusty
red
with
a
bit
of
head
and
not
much
lacing
quite
clear
smells
hoppy
and
a
bit
fruity
a
bit
of
citrus
hits
the
nose
pretty
quickly
tastes
malty
very
malty
theres
some
fruityness
in
there
banana
perhaps
and
i
get
some
faint
hints
of
lime
some
nice
toastynessbreadynessbiscuityness
near
the
end
that
really
brings
the
flavors
together
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
quite
drinkable
light
crisp
good
thirstquencher
drinkability
quite
drinkability
a
nice
affordable
decent
beer
that
could
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
its
not
the
best
beer
made
by
brooklyn
but
it
was
ok
overall
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
liked
it
but
really
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
about
it
id
recommend
it
if
you
are
looking
for
just
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
this
would
probably
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
to
your
bmc
friends
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
is
actively
carbonated
overall
impression
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
nice
example
of
an
apa
that
hasnt
been
overhopped
okay
no
a
bad
apa
offered
up
by
the
folks
at
brooklyn
well
balanced
and
easily
quaffed
at
just
over
5
2
worth
a
shot
i
could
easily
picture
myself
sitting
at
a
ball
game
with
one
of
these
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
especially
with
the
nice
carbonation
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
id
happily
drink
it
if
someone
else
was
paying
i
cant
think
of
a
easier
drinking
beer
off
the
top
of
my
head
low
abv
but
high
in
satisfaction
methinks
a
really
drinkable
beer
and
given
its
fairly
low
abv
you
could
easly
enjoy
these
bad
boys
all
day
long
m
d
mouthfeel
is
odd
slick
and
oily
makes
it
go
down
smooth
leaving
a
slight
sweet
malt
flavor
in
your
mouth
not
a
very
simple
alecomplex
malthop
notes
leave
you
scratching
your
head
drinkability
is
rather
high
as
its
not
a
heavy
ale
i
would
have
another
one
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
brooklyn
i
think
this
beers
biggest
attraction
is
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
buttery
attributes
translucent
bright
copper
lacking
in
carbonation
in
both
appearance
and
mouthfeel
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
like
fresh
doughy
baked
bread
flavor
is
earthy
and
metallic
and
has
a
chewy
rye
bread
notes
i
could
ask
for
more
just
a
bit
more
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
so
i
will
can
i
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
on
the
palate
this
may
be
brewed
in
america
but
the
flavor
is
downright
english
a
nice
flavorful
beer
that
would
be
a
delight
on
cask
in
an
english
pub
though
the
amount
of
carbonation
here
is
reminiscent
of
cask
ale
certainly
one
for
a
session
overall
id
say
that
this
beer
is
miscategorized
id
call
this
an
englishstyle
pale
ale
not
an
american
for
what
it
is
it
accomplishes
its
goals
decently
enough
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
is
a
good
transition
for
people
trying
to
get
away
from
macro
brews
overall
this
isnt
a
spectacular
brew
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
one
of
its
strengths
is
its
simplicity
its
a
nice
refreshing
beer
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
foam
th
whole
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
mainly
malty
exhibiting
characteristics
of
berry
fruits
along
with
underlying
hops
the
taste
also
is
very
malty
up
front
again
these
flavors
seem
to
berry
fruits
the
hops
in
this
beer
are
rather
faint
and
tough
to
distinguish
the
beer
feels
nicely
thick
with
a
good
leve
of
carbonation
overall
i
do
not
overly
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
and
i
would
much
prefer
a
pale
ale
with
a
higher
level
of
hoppiness
taste
is
slightly
bare
but
the
smoky
character
is
there
this
is
a
malty
beer
tasting
like
a
good
english
pale
ale
smooth
and
crisp
the
carbonation
is
light
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
superbly
drinkable
the
mouth
feel
was
wonderfully
creamy
and
the
body
is
just
right
for
a
pale
ale
very
refreshing
and
i
drank
quite
a
bit
of
this
on
the
boat
during
the
summer
it
works
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
but
i
am
always
left
wishing
for
a
different
pale
ale
if
the
flavor
lived
up
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
id
get
this
way
more
often
this
pours
a
reddish
golden
color
amost
honey
like
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
the
smell
has
a
real
roasty
maltness
to
it
its
really
a
nice
aroma
the
taste
is
a
smooth
malty
carmel
flavor
its
not
too
hoppybut
it
has
a
nice
roasty
flavor
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
and
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
have
againnot
perfectbut
damn
good
smelled
of
hops
and
mild
roasted
malt
somewhat
sweet
the
taste
was
the
same
not
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
but
had
that
hop
bitterness
which
faded
into
a
pleasant
sweetness
nothing
overpowering
and
nothing
incredible
but
definitely
balanced
and
refreshing
mild
carbonation
i
use
the
word
mild
a
fair
amount
in
this
review
and
thats
exactly
what
this
beer
is
decent
but
not
outstanding
it
was
quite
drinkable
because
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
relatively
low
alcohol
content
it
pours
a
light
cooper
color
with
minimal
head
and
only
a
small
amount
of
lacing
i
smell
grains
and
hops
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
rather
mild
and
unengaging
with
somewhat
balanced
hopmalt
profiles
a
bit
breadlike
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
much
more
going
on
there
the
drinkability
is
good
because
its
a
mild
beer
and
can
be
enjoyed
repeatedly
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
two
finger
head
and
good
lace
smells
of
a
good
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
citrus
hop
presence
not
the
amout
of
what
i
expect
from
a
pale
ale
a
damn
tasty
beer
but
not
enough
hops
for
the
style
a
nice
caramel
malt
with
a
moderate
hop
presence
but
not
enough
imho
crisp
and
very
easy
drinking
again
very
tasty
but
scored
low
due
to
the
lack
of
hop
presence
i
think
anapa
should
have
the
brooklyn
lager
has
much
more
than
it
should
and
maybe
the
two
should
be
reversed
a
nice
pale
ale
i
was
hoping
to
drink
some
brooklyn
ale
in
brooklyn
amber
in
color
with
a
white
headskie
quite
light
with
some
toasty
notes
hoppy
in
balanced
goodness
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
quite
the
drinkable
ill
have
another
please
pours
light
copper
with
a
short
slightly
foamy
head
a
little
retention
a
little
lacing
good
carbonation
smells
of
light
malts
hops
and
sweet
caramel
and
fruit
notes
reminds
me
of
9
without
the
apricot
taste
follows
well
slight
hops
with
a
good
mild
sweetness
very
nice
crisp
and
clean
good
balance
id
definitely
want
to
get
more
of
this
packaged
as
the
penant
55
best
before
not
properly
notched
on
the
label
citrusy
aroma
comes
through
very
slightly
in
the
flavor
which
is
mostly
dominated
by
caramelly
malts
enjoyed
several
while
in
brooklyn
light
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
reminded
me
of
a
fresh
sam
adams
worth
having
a
few
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
estery
with
some
toasted
bread
and
caramel
malt
notes
and
some
citrusy
hops
flavor
is
subtle
but
complex
some
light
citrus
hop
flavors
followed
by
some
fruity
ale
esters
caramel
and
toasted
bread
light
and
refreshing
yet
flavorful
this
is
an
impressive
session
beer
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
brooklyn
they
might
not
all
be
spectacular
but
they
are
at
least
descent
this
is
not
a
particularly
exciting
apa
but
a
drinkable
and
tasty
session
beer
with
brooklyns
good
rep
i
thought
this
might
be
a
fluke
but
on
my
way
to
the
write
a
review
button
i
browsed
a
couple
others
and
it
turns
out
its
just
an
offbrew
for
them
i
guess
i
guess
if
you
want
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
and
ignore
this
is
your
beer
unintrusive
mild
forgettable
with
so
many
pale
ales
in
the
world
of
beer
there
are
undoubtedly
better
ones
you
can
pick
up
easy
drinking
session
beer
kind
of
like
a
pale
ale
light
its
been
a
few
days
since
i
ordered
this
on
draft
but
i
could
have
swore
this
one
did
not
seem
like
a
pale
ale
its
labeled
under
pennet
55
ale
which
is
a
great
name
imo
nice
head
lighter
in
color
in
comparsion
and
not
too
hoppy
great
carbonation
and
easy
enough
to
drink
to
be
a
session
beer
this
brew
is
a
dark
hazy
copper
color
with
a
thick
soapy
white
head
its
certainly
an
invitinglooking
beer
the
aroma
is
muted
malt
and
grain
along
with
a
peppery
herbal
hoppiness
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
malt
characteristics
its
a
smooth
maltsided
brew
with
just
enough
hop
to
balance
things
out
i
found
it
very
highly
carbonatedalmost
too
carbonated
prickly
carbonic
qualities
are
a
bit
distracting
very
nice
brewwould
make
a
fine
session
beer
d
this
is
a
very
clean
beer
and
it
might
be
a
good
beer
to
quaft
at
a
95
degree
day
in
dodger
stadium
but
it
lacks
interest
otherwise
the
hops
are
almost
absent
and
the
malt
is
very
soft
a
light
beer
can
have
complexity
or
at
least
some
characteristics
but
i
cant
find
them
in
here
id
have
this
again
just
wish
it
was
more
true
to
the
style
mouthfeel
is
crsip
and
light
and
it
is
ever
so
drinkable
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
from
brooklyn
pours
with
a
nice
light
brown
body
and
a
fairly
frothy
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
lace
the
smell
has
more
of
a
malt
character
than
a
hops
characteri
expect
a
bit
more
hops
from
a
pale
but
the
maltiness
seems
to
work
well
here
taste
was
very
pleasantly
smooth
and
had
the
same
maltiness
as
the
aroma
despite
the
heavy
malt
notes
this
is
still
a
nice
crisp
and
light
ale
very
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
ale
along
the
lines
of
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
brooklyn
d
a
great
session
beer
light
and
delicious
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
ale
would
make
a
great
session
beer
and
a
six
pack
could
easily
and
enjoyably
be
consumed
during
the
course
of
a
ball
game
very
nicely
done
there
is
some
taste
here
it
is
clearly
a
british
style
pale
with
some
hops
and
well
malted
medium
mouthfeel
from
nuttiness
good
carbonation
tad
of
metallic
aftertaste
tad
of
bitterness
decent
attractive
darker
colour
and
head
beer
was
ok
but
not
that
drinkable
damn
this
beer
is
drinkable
maybe
thats
why
i
had
another
overallalthough
solid
i
found
this
apa
to
be
a
dissapontment
too
much
alcohol
to
be
called
balanced
not
enough
in
terms
of
head
retention
or
aroma
i
tend
to
prefer
my
beers
hoppy
rather
than
malty
so
im
trying
to
be
fair
but
still
i
expect
more
from
such
a
good
brewery
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
a
little
floral
there
is
a
slight
buttery
character
a
light
tea
aroma
too
sweet
caramel
malts
dominate
up
front
and
then
an
herbal
hop
bitterness
dominates
the
back
there
is
a
light
citrusy
fruitiness
that
makes
an
appearance
towards
the
middle
medium
bodied
with
fairly
strong
carbonation
good
drinkability
a
good
beer
to
chill
in
the
context
of
a
warm
day
with
but
appropriate
anytime
tase
is
light
malty
and
raher
drinkable
solid
malt
base
accentuated
wiht
citrus
and
hoppy
goodness
not
an
overly
amazing
brew
but
solid
drinkable
and
enjoyable
could
end
up
being
a
nice
lawn
mower
brew
enjoyed
on
tap
last
night
at
a
bob
dylan
concert
presented
as
a
moderate
amber
color
with
moderate
white
head
smell
is
lightly
of
hops
with
a
malt
background
taste
is
very
mild
with
a
light
hop
texture
and
slightly
dry
mouth
feel
easy
drinking
went
well
with
bob
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
caramel
in
nature
it
leaves
a
white
laced
head
that
disappates
quickly
as
you
drink
the
beer
is
clear
and
bright
looks
inviting
as
you
smell
it
malt
grass
and
grapefruit
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
lemon
honey
caramel
this
is
great
session
beer
one
that
would
go
well
with
blue
cheese
burger
or
fish
and
chips
a
dish
that
has
a
salty
finish
as
a
lover
of
brooklyn
beers
i
can
safely
say
that
other
offerings
from
garrett
oliver
are
more
impressive
still
this
brew
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
surprisingly
malty
given
the
hoppy
aroma
pretty
good
balance
for
a
pale
ale
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
but
nondescript
pale
ale
offering
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
im
really
into
this
hop
flavor
and
im
usually
a
hop
flavored
kind
of
guy
but
definitely
drinkable
ive
got
more
in
the
fridge
from
a
sample
case
so
i
guess
ill
find
out
mouthfeel
is
lightly
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
short
with
caramel
and
bread
tones
lasting
briefly
after
swallowing
very
nice
drinkability
and
a
good
session
beer
simple
but
enjoyable
a
decent
session
beer
but
honestly
it
just
tasted
like
every
other
middle
of
the
road
microbrew
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
first
sampled
this
at
a
beer
festival
from
the
tap
and
that
was
purely
delicious
hopefully
i
get
to
have
a
whole
such
beer
to
try
again
a
pretty
good
version
of
an
english
pale
in
terms
of
flavor
and
overall
presentation
nothing
too
exciting
but
no
complaints
either
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
but
not
overexciting
and
drinkability
comes
down
a
bit
as
well
since
i
dont
find
this
one
overly
appetizing
but
on
the
right
day
i
could
have
a
couple
if
i
was
craving
this
particular
flavor
persistent
herbal
hops
permeate
the
fruity
malt
light
hints
of
caramel
rinse
repeat
this
beer
is
a
onetrick
pony
but
it
has
a
good
trick
sweet
in
the
mouth
with
a
light
crisp
finish
nothin
fancy
but
a
wellbalanced
and
tasty
session
ale
nice
pours
a
deep
amber
color
wiht
a
big
sticky
white
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
meduim
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
taste
like
roasted
malts
a
littel
bit
of
carmel
and
citrus
hops
dry
hoppy
finish
no
doubt
a
classic
pale
ale
drinkability
sure
this
is
drinkable
but
i
just
found
it
to
be
kind
of
lacking
in
character
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
good
as
far
as
brooklyn
beers
go
brownish
amber
pour
with
a
nice
head
great
nuttymalty
scent
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
very
malty
with
some
breadbiscuit
flavors
with
adequate
hopping
and
similar
nuttyearthy
flavors
finish
is
extremely
dry
and
toasty
of
all
the
beers
ive
had
the
past
couple
of
weeks
this
one
might
be
my
favorite
its
simple
enough
that
you
can
drink
a
few
but
the
dry
complexity
is
pretty
interesting
nice
effort
woww
these
guys
are
amazing
this
beer
pours
a
really
nice
dark
amber
with
moderate
head
the
beer
smells
liek
it
is
going
to
taste
really
distinctive
but
really
really
easy
to
down
a
whole
6er
of
these
hard
to
describe
but
so
damn
pleasant
the
hops
are
orgasmic
like
other
brooklyn
beers
this
one
has
an
awesome
mouthfeel
a
little
stickey
a
tad
pricey
but
worth
it
one
of
my
favorites
and
im
not
sure
why
i
guess
it
just
aligns
up
with
my
tastebuds
prefectly
d
high
marks
here
cuz
this
is
a
fine
tasty
brew
makes
you
want
to
drink
a
second
the
smell
was
a
balanced
mix
of
grainy
malt
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
yeast
taste
was
dry
and
salty
with
caramel
and
toasted
malts
herbal
hops
and
buttery
diacetyl
coming
in
moderate
doses
medium
mouthfeel
was
just
right
for
the
summer
refresher
this
aims
to
be
aftertaste
was
delicate
but
long
drawn
out
floral
hops
dry
and
refreshing
i
can
see
me
having
several
sessions
with
this
while
the
red
sox
on
play
on
tv
a
clean
dark
copper
colored
beer
has
a
nice
small
bubbled
beige
head
there
is
a
heady
malt
aroma
with
strong
overtones
of
caramel
the
taste
is
at
first
a
light
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
just
before
the
clean
dry
finish
a
tastey
session
beer
definitely
overall
a
nice
light
ale
that
is
a
perfect
beer
to
give
to
your
budcoors
friends
it
just
might
open
their
eyes
medium
bodied
on
draft
at
the
brewery
during
a
31905
pubhop
clear
and
golden
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
eggshell
colored
head
bits
of
small
bubbles
in
the
center
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
seen
rising
excellent
head
retention
malty
carmamel
sweet
and
clean
not
too
much
jumping
out
at
you
slightly
frothy
feel
to
it
very
crisp
nicely
malty
bit
of
hops
in
there
but
not
much
slight
darkened
toast
flavors
left
on
your
tongue
but
very
balanced
i
will
have
no
problem
polishing
this
log
off
friends
have
been
coming
over
to
try
and
not
an
unsatisfied
one
yet
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
smooth
and
slick
but
pale
ale
uhuh
this
is
not
near
hoppy
enough
for
the
style
this
makes
a
very
fine
scottish
ale
i
might
even
grudgingly
call
it
an
english
pale
ale
but
it
is
a
very
poor
example
of
an
apa
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
sharing
poored
much
darker
than
what
i
expected
from
a
generic
ale
for
a
second
i
thought
i
bought
their
famous
brown
instead
until
i
got
a
wiff
of
the
hops
this
brew
has
a
good
mix
of
grassy
hops
and
crisp
carbonation
but
what
makes
it
stand
out
is
its
hardiness
compared
to
others
of
its
ilk
very
well
done
craft
brew
cream
filled
18
inch
of
head
with
some
picassolike
lacing
throughout
amber
hue
with
100
clarity
but
no
action
in
the
least
buttery
aspect
to
nose
and
a
hit
of
smokiness
pulls
through
as
the
ale
warms
butterscotch
sweetness
on
mouth
and
a
roasted
character
that
pervades
the
offering
a
tiny
hop
hit
during
the
closing
remarks
a
pleasant
ale
that
could
be
used
on
a
session
encounter
brooklyn
ale
pours
a
light
chestnut
clear
body
with
some
active
carbonation
going
on
skimpy
beige
head
is
shortlived
and
leaves
minimal
lace
nose
is
mostly
caramel
malt
with
an
even
balance
of
british
smelling
hops
that
add
floral
and
herbal
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
crisp
carbonation
taste
is
soft
in
that
english
ale
sort
of
way
with
a
delicately
balanced
hop
and
malt
profile
nothing
overwhelms
but
the
caramel
malt
seems
to
fold
perfectly
into
the
floral
and
herbal
hops
very
smooth
and
balanced
slightly
bitter
finish
with
a
clean
aftertaste
session
ales
dont
get
much
better
than
this
one
of
the
better
domestic
north
eastern
session
beers
out
there
very
well
balanced
with
a
great
drinkability
level
thick
creamy
khaki
colored
head
leaves
some
thick
lace
hazy
dark
copper
colored
beer
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
caramel
and
some
floral
hops
underneath
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
in
the
flavor
as
well
with
a
hop
tea
undertone
body
is
light
and
airy
almost
floating
across
your
tongue
without
leaving
much
flavor
just
ok
decided
to
check
the
label
and
its
about
2
months
past
the
best
before
date
looks
like
im
going
to
have
to
get
back
to
this
one
tarnished
reddened
copper
tones
with
a
decentsized
head
that
slowly
fades
back
to
a
nice
layer
of
pockmarked
fizz
lots
of
malty
aroma
pale
malt
nutty
bread
dough
and
a
bit
of
an
herbal
hop
quality
very
solid
flavor
almost
altbier
like
in
its
smoothness
slick
caramel
flavors
and
a
nice
light
to
medium
body
with
a
grassy
hop
balance
very
classic
englishstyle
pale
ale
and
extremely
quaffable
one
of
those
beers
that
isnt
over
the
top
but
in
this
case
thats
a
good
thing
just
a
very
enjoyable
flawless
ale
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
overall
a
really
nice
beer
wish
we
could
get
this
out
in
the
west
the
pour
is
a
light
clear
crystal
brown
a
dark
gold
with
overtones
of
darkness
in
it
the
smell
is
nice
clean
hops
and
a
nice
malty
backbone
the
first
and
subsequent
sips
are
nice
the
hops
come
to
the
forefront
but
not
so
agressively
the
only
problem
with
the
taste
is
the
aftertaste
theres
this
biscuity
taste
that
is
just
i
dont
know
its
like
an
overwhelming
malt
that
is
just
too
light
and
too
metallic
in
a
way
i
think
they
try
to
copy
the
water
of
bass
or
sam
smith
for
this
one
and
almost
hit
the
mark
but
nope
no
cigar
carbonation
is
good
normal
not
too
overwhelming
but
the
aftertaste
here
affects
the
drinkability
its
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
in
your
mouth
for
an
evening
call
me
crazy
but
i
dont
like
this
one
and
am
so
glad
this
bottle
is
the
last
one
in
the
sixer
this
is
the
first
beer
of
four
in
brooklyn
brewerys
variety
case
that
i
am
trying
the
beer
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
1
head
with
thin
lacing
the
smell
was
fruity
and
pleasant
first
taste
and
i
was
hooked
nice
maltiness
with
a
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
as
well
i
can
see
this
ale
as
a
nice
session
beer
the
aroma
is
at
first
hoppy
like
an
ipa
it
has
a
mild
malty
flavor
that
is
kind
of
sweet
and
caramel
tasting
the
taste
is
also
quite
hoppy
for
a
pale
ale
and
i
think
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
ale
chalk
another
one
up
for
brooklyn
in
some
ways
this
brew
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
bass
ale
and
sam
adams
boston
ale
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
brew
and
those
who
enjoy
pale
ales
in
the
english
vein
will
probably
like
this
one
drinkability
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
a
quality
session
beer
the
beer
poured
copper
in
color
but
with
a
thicker
and
foamier
head
than
i
usually
like
it
was
not
so
much
the
thickness
as
much
as
the
foam
like
quality
the
hops
are
quite
pleasant
the
type
i
like
on
a
hot
summer
day
they
are
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
biting
there
are
also
fruit
undertones
that
make
their
way
into
the
flavor
with
the
finish
poured
out
a
nice
amberreddish
color
with
almost
no
head
to
be
seen
smell
consisted
of
malts
mostly
with
some
hops
in
the
backround
for
good
measure
taste
was
huge
malts
upfront
it
was
quite
rich
and
creamy
when
some
hop
bitterness
blended
in
towards
the
end
but
the
malts
took
over
the
entire
way
even
through
the
aftertaste
i
would
like
to
see
the
malts
controlled
a
little
bit
and
give
the
hops
a
little
more
of
a
fighting
chance
in
this
brew
other
than
that
its
o
k
i
guess
pours
out
light
brown
slightly
cloudy
with
a
average
light
tan
head
great
aroma
with
plenty
of
orange
and
citrus
scents
the
taste
is
great
too
stays
true
to
the
scent
citrusy
without
being
too
overpoweringly
fruity
excellent
balance
of
malt
and
hops
you
can
really
feel
it
when
it
hits
the
back
of
your
tongue
i
am
thoroughly
pleased
with
this
brew
and
will
definitely
purchase
it
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
feel
that
it
is
a
good
representation
of
an
english
ale
this
is
perhaps
my
least
favorite
brooklyn
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
it
but
i
honestly
think
is
is
repackaged
saranac
it
just
isnt
challenging
this
is
not
to
say
it
is
a
bad
beer
hell
your
friends
would
probably
like
it
but
id
rather
drink
a
real
english
pale
ale
i
would
give
it
shot
on
cask
though
drinkability
another
nice
offering
from
this
brewery
i
picked
up
a
sixer
to
have
for
tomorrow
id
recommend
it
amber
coppery
colored
with
moderate
carbonation
fluffy
beige
head
hops
and
malty
sweetness
abound
rather
thin
and
sweet
in
the
malt
department
yet
quaffable
because
if
its
subdued
floral
hoppiness
good
sessioner
nice
fruitiness
in
the
finish
quality
ale
from
the
u
s
great
malt
taste
nicely
hopped
a
character
i
have
come
to
expect
from
brooklyn
beers
subtle
nutty
flavor
comes
through
a
full
bodied
beer
very
satisfying
above
average
in
the
mouthfeel
category
mediumlow
carbonation
nice
thickness
for
an
ale
easy
drinking
some
warming
alcohol
in
the
end
on
the
whole
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
is
malty
with
a
fruity
yeast
finish
it
also
has
a
decent
amount
of
aroma
hops
that
compliment
the
scent
the
taste
is
good
it
is
smooth
with
a
malty
taste
again
the
yeast
and
crystal
malts
add
a
sweet
and
fruity
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
an
excellent
drinking
ale
it
pours
a
clear
chestnut
amber
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
into
my
16
oz
brooklyn
brewery
pint
glass
head
dissapears
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
sweet
caramal
maltiness
with
a
biscuity
flavor
minimal
hop
bitterness
dry
finish
the
famous
maris
otter
pale
malt
is
used
for
this
english
style
pale
ale
mediumbody
and
a
great
session
ale
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
that
when
held
to
the
light
it
had
an
orange
hue
on
the
edges
the
head
that
was
created
was
an
off
whitelight
tan
color
the
consistency
was
thick
creamy
and
very
full
it
lasted
a
decent
amount
of
time
after
the
pour
lightly
carbonated
there
was
some
lace
left
behind
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
fresh
grass
flowers
with
wisps
of
fruit
citrus
and
caramels
the
tastes
were
crisp
clean
and
smooth
on
the
pallet
flavors
of
sweet
malts
and
fresh
grass
and
floral
hops
seemed
to
balance
each
other
all
through
the
sip
some
citrus
and
biscuit
flavors
were
also
noticeable
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
but
had
a
sweet
feel
to
it
as
well
the
body
is
light
to
medium
decent
beer
refreshing
and
well
balanced
in
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
would
love
to
sample
a
brooklyn
brewed
draft
someday
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
what
a
great
ale
garrett
oliver
never
disappoints
this
ale
poured
a
clear
hint
of
haze
chestnut
redbrown
color
with
light
tan
foam
that
settled
relatively
quickly
the
smell
was
sweetly
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
some
floral
notes
the
taste
was
malty
with
floral
hop
flavors
but
not
much
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
was
rather
subdued
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
very
dry
the
body
was
medium
with
a
lingering
tangy
and
mildly
floral
aftertaste
this
ale
was
easy
to
drink
this
bottle
had
been
in
my
refridgerator
a
long
time
best
by
nov
02
but
the
only
effect
on
the
flavor
seems
to
have
been
a
mellowing
of
the
hop
bitterness
otherwise
it
tasted
fine
this
is
brooklyns
great
session
beer
not
the
lager
reddishamber
body
with
seemingly
restrained
carbonation
topped
by
a
crown
of
creamy
white
mousse
once
sip
reveals
that
they
were
shooting
for
a
britishstyle
pale
which
they
nailed
with
ease
this
oozes
maris
otter
with
a
little
floral
hopping
to
balance
long
caramel
toast
n
tea
finish
the
bitterness
and
carbonation
are
clean
creamy
and
cleansing
prepping
the
mouth
for
another
nutty
sip
not
a
showy
westcoastpa
but
a
refined
traditional
example
pours
a
great
amber
hue
thick
tan
head
retains
well
great
lacing

malty

up

pleasant
sourness
going
on
throughout
this

fuggle
hops
can
be
detected
bitter
palate
malty
throughout
borderline
chewy
on
the
malt
side
leans
heavy
towards
the
english
side
the
balance
is
near
perfection
via
the
hops
malts
and
bitterness
outstanding
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
odd
and
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
tastes
first
of
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
hint
at
fruit
in
the
middle
then
a
bitter
hop
finish
that
gives
good
balance
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
medium
body
and
a
slight
bite
very
drinkable
another
great
brooklyn
beer
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
creamy
thick
foam
hops
lead
the
aroma
profile
earthy
and
floral
malt
profile
starts
with
butterscotch
very
esblike
the
body
is
refreshingly
light
with
a
lingering
grainy
malt
in
the
dry
finish
the
malt
is
balanced
with
an
earthy
hop
flavor
overall
an
ok
pint
but
no
outstanding
feature
thanks
stegmakk
for
the
sample
the
name
may
have
changed
from
pennant
pale
ale
to
just
plain
brooklyn
ale
but
the
product
remains
the
same
bottle
was
freshness
dated
and
the
product
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
creamy
head
no
overpowering
aroma
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
with
the
hop
presence
being
less
pronounced
than
in
many
pale
ales
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
to
me
its
a
nice
solid
pale
ale
with
no
unusual
atttributes
very
drinkable
throughout
an
evening
or
if
youre
having
only
one
what
an
enjoyable
beer
golden
amber
color
with
a
light
beige
foamy
head
that
sticks
around
and
laces
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
bitter
hops
with
some
citrus
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
just
feels
really
good
overall
the
flavor
is
round
and
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
bit
yeasty
very
pleasing
malt
a
bit
tannic
and
hop
bitterness
that
tingles
the
throat
also
some
citrus
pine
and
a
bit
of
fruit
very
drinkable
especially
if
youre
fortunate
to
have
it
very
fresh
at
the
brewery
this
beer
pours
a
very
choppy
head
it
settles
to
a
thin
layer
that
lasts
throughout
the
length
of
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
light
reddish
amber
aroma
is
primarily
of
oak
tastes
creamy
and
thick
this
is
a
very
good
brew
its
complex
and
very
drinkable
poured
a
beautiful
coppery
chestnut
but
failed
to
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
appearance
sourish
aroma
hinting
of
grape
not
quite
there
with
the
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
malt
is
not
nearly
hefty
enough
and
comes
across
as
timid
rather
sour
and
astringent
hopping
is
mild
and
nondescript
not
up
to
par
with
the
other
brews
ive
been
fortunate
to
sample
from
brooklyn
again
bought
a
sampler
without
checking
the
best
by
date
so
it
was
supposed
be
drank
before
june
2002
appearance
is
a
medium
amber
brown
with
a
cream
toned
decent
sized
foam
head
minimal
lacing
going
on
but
an
overall
decent
appearance
aroma
well
even
after
being
well
past
the
best
by
date
this
beer
stilll
retains
many
adimrable
qualities
a
nice
smooth
floral
hop
aroma
balanced
by
a
nutty
caramel
malt
tones
you
can
tell
this
beer
is
overly
ripe
but
i
think
the
hops
preserved
enough
to
make
it
a
pleasant
session
brew
the
flavor
has
a
sweet
forefront
of
malt
followed
by
a
trickling
of
mild
bittering
hops
with
a
nutty
finish
to
it
lighter
in
body
with
little
or
no
complexities
to
make
this
beer
that
interesting
to
me
drinkability
as
of
now
this
is
a
mediocre
session
beer
that
i
still
will
drink
only
to
try
it
fresher
as
the
beer
sets
in
my
glass
a
deep
burnished
copper
color
the
head
mountainous
in
size
the
color
a
winsome
light
tan
and
the
consistency
creamy
nose
is
malt
sweet
crisp
and
fresh
the
start
is
richly
malt
the
top
middling
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
spiteful
acidity
the
hops
present
and
spicy
in
their
bite
a
dry
aftertaste
and
another
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
the
brooklyn
ale
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
but
consistent
head
no
apparent
lacing
and
the
beer
had
a
somewhat
flat
appearance
the
smell
was
impressive
with
subtle
fruity
elements
mixed
with
a
strong
malty
odor
the
hops
become
a
little
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
the
maltiness
remains
dominant
a
breadlike
taste
was
also
present
maybe
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
the
medium
body
was
appropriate
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
fizz
on
the
tongue
maybe
a
little
flat
but
not
terribly
so
overall
this
brooklyn
product
was
a
pretty
good
ale
and
it
went
surprisingly
well
with
my
fish
dinner
bottom
line
for
those
of
you
who
think
that
this
is
very
english
in
style
ought
to
try
fullers
london
pride
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
i
have
hadpoured
a
real
nice
copper
color
with
medium
well
retained
head
very
hoppy
aroma
but
great
malty
balance
to
this
brewhop
was
present
but
not
overpowering
i
like
a
good
balanced
pale
ale
alot
more
than
one
with
too
much
bitternessif
i
want
that
i
will
order
a
ipa
this
brewery
makes
some
real
nice
beers
at
least
all
the
ones
i
have
had
mucho
gracias
unclejimbo
f
this
is
one
excellent
beer
very
rich
and
smooth
with
a
mass
of
malts
it
is
very
similar
to
sam
adams
boston
ale
very
robust
and
full
of
flavor
with
a
medium
full
body
carbonation
is
light
there
is
a
mild
hop
presence
that
adds
a
little
complexity
to
the
brew
a
wonderful
drinking
beer
i
had
to
fight
over
these
tasty
treats
as
the
card
games
rolled
on
a
friend
of
mine
a
die
hard
lager
man
just
wanted
more
and
more
a
fine
job
done
on
this
beer
had
a
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
was
a
malty
caramel
and
som
fruit
notes
the
taste
is
malty
and
somewhat
sweet
with
nice
smooth
and
rich
mouthfeel
the
hops
are
there
and
not
a
large
part
of
the
overall
taste
but
do
a
nice
job
with
balancing
the
beer
and
giving
small
citrus
twang
overall
a
good
beer
and
would
really
like
to
try
on
tap
in
brooklyn
according
to
other
reviews
this
brooklyn
ale
is
the
same
thing
as
pennant
pale
ale
they
just
changed
the
name
so
here
i
go
orangish
brew
with
a
very
nice
white
head
on
top
nice
and
thick
stays
pretty
well
for
a
while
but
loses
its
edge
about
halfway
through
english
hop
aroma
for
the
most
part
maltiness
is
bready
a
bit
of
sourness
is
in
there
too
on
the
palate
hoppiness
dances
on
the
tongue
creating
a
tingle
while
malt
stays
at
the
edges
for
the
maltiness
think
sourdough
bread
with
a
little
sugar
added
english
with
an
american
touch
smooth
medium
bodied
nice
mouthfeel
overall
clean
crisp
finish
pretty
good
pale
ale
nice
take
on
the
style
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
this
one
this
was
a
little
darker
than
most
pale
ales
witha
very
deep
copperchestnut
color
the
head
receded
immediatly
into
some
bubbles
that
lined
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
lacked
the
hop
that
usually
accompanies
pales
there
were
aromas
of
yeast
and
pears
with
a
definite
emphasis
on
malt
characteristics
the
taste
was
sweet
with
subtle
notes
of
wheat
bread
pear
and
apple
upfront
i
ddi
not
experience
a
very
strong
hop
finish
until
the
last
third
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
howver
very
mellow
without
too
much
carbonation
definitely
thick
and
malted
without
a
real
crispness
of
some
pales
this
beer
is
not
what
i
am
used
to
in
a
pale
ale
but
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
an
easily
drinkable
ale
base
and
when
you
can
get
it
fresh
which
can
be
a
problem
because
it
is
so
widely
shipped
and
thus
widely
sits
around
and
waits
it
gives
off
a
potpourri
blend
of
nose
and
tongue
for
myself
a
great
daytoday
ale
but
with
more
character
mainly
in
the
nose
and
complexity
mainly
on
the
taongue
than
a
typical
daytoday
ale
i
grab
it
when
i
want
a
cheaper
six
pack
that
wont
drink
like
a
cheaper
sixpack
a
good
session
beer
though
would
be
better
with
slightly
more
carbonation
a
golden
copper
color
with
beige
head
and
both
moderate
head
retention
and
lacing
problems
begin
in
the
nose
immediately
a
heavy
alcoholic
element
similar
to
scotch
seeming
inappropriate
to
the
style
and
just
plain
unappealing
to
me
also
in
the
nose
caramel
malt
and
citrus
on
palate
the
promise
of
the
nose
is
delivered
with
again
that
alcohol
offnote
that
is
just
too
direct
and
out
of
place
additionally
a
heavy
sweetness
with
roasty
caramel
malt
notes
there
is
a
slight
dryness
in
the
finish
but
nowhere
near
balancing
the
heavy
sweetness
and
despite
this
potent
combination
of
heavy
alchohol
and
sweet
elements
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
the
finish
is
somewhat
cloying
and
just
sort
of
drops
off
haphazardly
boy
this
is
coming
off
negative
im
just
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
though
its
still
brooklyn
its
still
craftbrewed
and
its
still
better
than
lots
of
beers
out
there
despite
the
hops
snap
its
a
thin
beer
to
me
and
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
i
cannot
define
it
comes
after
that
ginger
i
dont
like
it
but
i
am
hardpressed
to
describe
it
its
fruity
but
i
cant
get
much
closer
than
that
oelergud
the
bottle
indicates
that
the
color
of
this
beer
is
chestnut
i
would
call
it
amber
head
retention
is
mediumlow
but
the
beer
does
leave
behind
some
nice
rings
of
lace
the
nose
is
fruity
suggesting
grape
and
yeasty
with
some
additional
more
aggressive
spicy
notes
that
ive
had
trouble
identifying
even
after
multiple
samples
on
the
palate
a
rich
malt
flavor
stands
out
with
slight
citrusy
undertones
the
finish
displays
contrasting
elements
of
sweet
and
sour
which
are
unbalanced
and
could
be
brought
together
more
effectively
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
also
somewhat
odd
its
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
lacks
the
appropriate
bitterness
that
i
expect
in
a
pale
ale
clear
deeply
tawny
reddish
mahogany
in
color
the
ivory
colored
head
is
a
creamy
holds
well
and
leaves
some
minimal
lace
the
aroma
offers
a
lightly
fruity
caramel
maltiness
with
some
earthy
spicy
hops
very
nice
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
and
restrained
carbonation
giving
a
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
somewhat
fruity
with
a
distinctive
caramel
maltiness
thats
gently
supported
by
hop
bitterness
the
maltiness
has
a
certain
richness
to
it
but
i
question
how
much
of
that
comes
from
using
maris
otter
and
how
much
comes
from
mash
temperature
and
dextrinous
crystal
malts
some
grassy
earthy
and
lightly
spicy
hop
flavors
appear
in
the
finish
an
excellent
englishstyle
pale
that
would
make
a
good
session
ale
with
a
slightly
lower
alcohol
content
id
love
to
try
this
out
of
the
brewery
in
brooklyn
and
a
cask
would
surely
be
stellar
however
the
bottled
version
offers
some
of
the
f
x
matt
house
character
that
is
sometimes
described
as
soapy
still
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
if
brooklyn
can
get
some
buttery
diacetyl
notes
into
the
fermentation
like
ive
come
to
savor
from
the
english
varieties
this
would
be
a
killer
brew
pours
a
rich
bright
copper
mixed
with
red
highlights
the
head
was
small
creamysticky
and
offwhite
in
color
on
the
nose
there
is
a
nice
fruity
armoa
malty
light
but
complex
hop
aroma
also
on
the
palate
it
starts
with
sweet
malt
flavor
fruity
little
biscuity
slight
citrus
from
the
hops
crisp
smooth
mouth
feel
emmm
this
pale
ale
is
very
enjoyableoverall
a
very
good
english
styled
pale
full
flavor
and
very
drinkable
just
great
drink
them
over
and
over
you
will
dig
it
cheers
medium
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dwindled
to
a
sticky
lace
hoppy
slightly
citrusy
smell
malty
at
first
followed
by
a
pleasing
hop
influx
that
keeps
things
honest
a
terrific
beer
this
brew
is
on
the
darker
side
of
the
spectrum
for
pale
ales
it
is
a
deep
copper
decent
head
the
aroma
is
nice
it
showcases
a
nice
herbal
hop
aroma
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
taste
is
nice
as
well
it
definitely
has
the
english
slant
to
it
but
i
like
it
normally
i
prefer
the
american
version
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
englishstyle
pale
ales
ive
had
very
solid
malt
backbone
and
enough
hopping
to
give
a
nice
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
which
is
nice
very
nice
nice
copper
color
with
a
head
that
is
quick
to
leave
the
smell
is
of
earthy
hops
and
some
slight
malt
interesting
taste
malt
hops
malt
on
the
tongue
the
malt
is
not
too
sweet
and
slightly
caramel
with
the
hops
being
mild
in
the
english
style
almost
tastes
like
a
hoppy
and
lighter
bodied
brown
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
a
nice
brew
slightly
different
than
some
of
the
other
epas
but
very
nice
regardless
96
my
first
exposure
to
the
brooklyn
brewery
and
it
was
a
pleasant
one
this
brew
is
a
beautiful
dark
copper
color
and
it
has
the
taste
to
match
with
an
absolutely
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
very
fresh
in
the
metro
area
and
as
another
said
pleasantly
inexpensive
highly
recommended
this
beer
measures
up
quite
well
against
its
english
counterparts
classic
malt
flavor
with
fuggles
and
ek
goldings
to
round
out
the
brew
and
its
one
of
the
wed
specials
at
the
local
imperial

giddyup
very
nice
brew
from
a
great
brewery
more
mild
than
their
ipa
due
to
a
lesser
hop
character
and
with
the
malt
flavor
more
pronounced
as
the
name
suggests
good
beer
for
watching
baseball
notes
a
classic
example
of
an
american
made
english
pale
ale
very
true
to
the
style
brooklyns
tribute
to
the
world
champion
brooklyn
baseball
team
below
average
beer
for
me
has
a
real
cheap
beer
taste
to
it
just
a
good
all
around
pale
ale
nothing
really
stands
out
but
its
still
a
great
beer
it
is
good
drinking
not
the
best
ive
had
but
still
a
good
brew
great
hoppy
taste
a
favorite
had
this
on
tap
at
matts
bar
in
minneapolis
good
beer
overall
this
was
our
first
rating
undertaken
at
a
sports
event
it
was
a
rather
impromptu
decision
to
attend
the
game
in
the
first
play
but
once
we
got
there
we
searched
high
and
low
for
something
on
the
crafty
side
this
was
clearly
our
best
option
but
for
the
13
each
we
paid
it
was
made
that
much
more
bittersweet
the
aroma
and
flavoring
were
pretty
generic
and
the
hearty
toast
of
those
adjuncts
effectively
blocked
out
any
balancing
hoppiness
lingering
in
the
background
we
were
glad
to
get
to
sip
on
something
more
our
style
and
something
local
during
the
game
but
with
that
markup
it
clearly
wasnt
worth
it
an
adequate
beer
worth
buying
at
25case
a
bit
fizzy
at
first
gulp
but
a
full
fresh
taste
not
exceptional
but
good
barley

this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
nothing
stands
out
as
amazing
but
its
damn
good
overall
brown
smooth
and
malty
which
fades
to
bitter
and
dryness
a
decent
pale
ale
decent
seems
to
describe
most
of
this

for
a
pale
this
is
entirely
drinkable
not
as
drinkable
as
say
an
every
night
lager
but
i
can
choke
it
down
without
much
hassle
for
those
that
know
me
and
follow
me
im
not
really
a
fan
of
ipas
apas
or
any
other
pale
alelager
a
drinkable
pale
with
enough
malt
to
balance
the
hops
is
what
i
look
for
and
this
is
one
of
those
brews
o
not
very
impressed
if
you
give
it
a
try
dont
expect
much
if
anheuserbusch
made
a
pale
ale
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
very
little

for
5

great
everyday
beer
great
color
and

the
color
of
the
beer
alone
has
it
known
presumably
that
itll
be
a
malty
beer
and
it
is
the
color
is
basically
beer
bottle
brown
with
maybe
a
slight
haze
theres
a
pretty
awesome
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
and
taste
is
pretty
unique
not
sure
of
the
hops
or
malts
they
use
in
this
one
but
seeing
it
labelled
an
english
pale
ale
makes
sense
to
me
caramel
and
maybe
some
munich
malts
with
herbal
hops
and
a
kind
of
citrus
rind
bitterness
thats
not
too
heavy
makes
for
a
solid
flavorful
easydrinking
beer
i
was
disappointed
at
first
thinking
it
was
an
ipa
since
i
was
told
it
was
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
for
the
style
quite
nicely
done
decent
enough
i

straight
from
the

had

that
lingered

the
beer
was
light

easy
to

im
not
a
big
fan
of
pale

but
would
definitely
consider
this
again
overall
a
very

easy

and
well

well
done
too

too

not

had
so
much
summit
epa
overall
impression
a
fine
beer
but
a
little
short
of
an
xpa
in
my
opinion
id
up
the
hops
maybe
dry
hop
with
some
c
hops
something
still
a
fine
summer
beer
poured
out
to
a
pumpkin

color
with
a

dense
foamy

low
carbonation
not
much
of

hops

mild
with
an
average

some
grain
and
malt
notes
mixed
in
for
good
measure
decent
mouthfeel
couldve
benefited
from
better
carbonation
to
present
the

a
bit
more
good
drinkability
not
as
good
as
a
washington
or
so
cal
ipa
for
sure
decent
summits
workhorse
a
balanced
pale
ale
that
is
a
decent
first
step
into
the
craft
beer
world
for
many
a
twin
cities
drinker
just
about
every
place
has
it
and
its
a
good
step
up
from
the
macros
da
good
quality
apa
but
this
one
is
not
particularly
suited
to
my
tastes
i
like
slightly
more
hops
and
a
bit
more
carbonation
body
is
great
and
although
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
id
be
willing
to
split
the
rest
overall
this
was
pretty
much
a
standard
pale
ale
a
little
nice
kick
to
it
but
pretty
standard
nothing
i
could
call
out
for
being
bad
in
anyway
just
seemed
to
not
have
enough
to
put
it
over
the
top
i
dont
know
that
i
would
seek
this
out
but
it
would
certainly
not
be
a
bad
one
for
gameday
six
packs
or
barbecues
a
good
call
would
be
how
i
would
rate
this
drinkability
very
enjoyable
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
dinner
drinkability
well
this
is
by
far
my
session
beer
of
choice
ultimately
drinkable
and
ultimately
enjoyable
well
done
summit
i
see
this
beer
around
minnesota
so
much
its
easy
to
forget
that
its
a
quality
brew
its
got
a
fairly
unique
and
its
hard
to
find
something
unique
these
days
blend
of
malt
sweetness
with
rich
roasted
caramel
thats
complimented
by
a
balanced
bitterness
of
grassy
hops
its
a
great
session
beer
and
readily
available
around
the
area
thank
you
summit
d
excellent
ale
from
summit
that
combines
great
features
of
an
ipa
and
cleaner
styles
to
create
a
really
unique
beer
d
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
one
but
is
a
nice
choice
at
restaurants
that
serve
nothing
but
bmc
drinkability
excellent
affordable
local
brew
for
those
in
minnesota
wouldnt
be
a
terrible
choice
for
a
sessionable
beer
drinkability
highly
drinkable
pale
ale
would
be
proud
to
serve
this
at
my
monthly
poker
game
d
very
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
throw
back
quite
a
few
of
these
with
no
problems
sampled
at
hills
market
beer
tasting
this
brew
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
and
fizzy
white
head
that
burns
off
fairly
fast
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
mildly
piney
hops
with
touches
of
citrus
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
with
hops
over
sweet
toffee
and
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
dry
and
short
with
a
slight
grapefruit
aftertaste
slightly
above
average
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
perfectly
balanced
pale
ale
as
another
fellow
beer
advocate
wrote
no
two
flavors
overide
each
other
the
hops
and
malts
are
in
perfect
harmony
it
is
also
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
the
5
10
abv
is
not
that
noticeable
and
this
was
a
better
summer
brew
than
a
hoppier
or
darker
offering
its
refreshing
to
find
a
beer
of
this
style
from
a
part
of
the
country
that
doesnt
sell
a
lot
of
microbrew
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
and
im
glad
i
sampled
it
once
if
only
summer
was
still
here
overallquite
nice
like
snpa
in
drinkability
this
beer
poured
clear
with
a
slightly
red
brown
color
it
had
a
light
head
that
poured
think
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
there
was
also
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
woody
hops
smell
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
the
nose
it
tasted
a
lot
like
it
smelled
very
hopped
with
a
strong
bite
the
beer
doesnt
kill
your
senses
but
it
takes
a
good
swing
at
them
it
has
a
light
crisp
body
with
a
strong
aftertaste
this
is
a
fine
pale
ale
if
you
like
a
hops
bite
it
is
heavy
in
the
hops
area
for
a
normal
pale
ale
but
just
about
right
for
an
extra
pale
ale
id
drink
it
again
balance
and
drinkability
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
theres
enough
going
on
for
those
with
experience
and
a
great
place
for
a
beginner
to
start
its
the
quintessential
minnesotan
beer
finish
is
okay
but
short
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
that
one
probably
be
good
as
a
session
beer
on
a
warm
day
pours
a
nice
copper
body
with
a
taupe
head
smells
of
a
significant
hop
presence
maybe
some
light
fruity
esters
overall
the
taste
was
reather
pleasing
certainly
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
was
good
nonetheless
citrusy
hoppy
spiciness
with
a
good
dose
of
malt
really
cold
and
clean
finish
just
a
good
session
beer
all
around
if
you
ask
me
another
good
example
of
the
diversity
and
variety
in
the
twin
cities
it
is
a
solid
american
brew
that
doesnt
try
too
hard
overall
a
good
pale
ale
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
beer
to
offer
guests
new
to
craft
beer
though
i
always
enjoy
the
modest
bottle
presentation
of
the
summit
beers
on
tap
in
bloomington
mn

nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
with
decent
lacing
apparent
hoppiness
and
citrus
was
present
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
slightly
bitter
feel
with
an
honest
finish
that
held
on
to
the
tongue
it
is
a
good
apa

good
enough
that
i
had
it
a
few
more
times
during
my
three
day
business
trip
to
bloomington
d
not
a
lot
of
appealing
characteristics
pass
the
appearance
is
dark
orange
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
head
captures
some
citrus
notes
and
dissipates
after
a
few
minutes
the
hop
aroma
is
very
sharp
which
follows
in
the
taste
delightfully
bitter
with
citrus
undertones
which
linger
a
wonderful
apa
with
good
balance
and
character
i
gave
higher
marks
on
drinkability
bc
it
went
down
nicely
and
i
drank
the
glass
quickly
as
for
the
style
it
misses
a
bit
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
is
an
alright
apa
not
something
that
id
buy
again
though
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
much
better
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
its
a
standard
solid
apa
however
there
is
nothing
all
that
great
about
it
sure
it
fits
the
category
and
meets
expectations
but
it
is
more
or
less
average
nothing
to
really
make
me
want
to
come
back
to
it
not
a
great
beer
overall
i
didnt
dislike
it
per
se
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
because
there
are
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
this
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
deep
goldenlight
copper
color
in
to
my
pint
glass
a
very
nice
color
there
is
a
medium
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
to
a
skim
the
aroma
is
moderately
hoppy
citrus
character
there
is
also
mediumlow
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
tones
the
taste
has
moderatelow
sweetness
likely
from
caramel
malts
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
a
solid
moderate
bitterness
and
a
moderatehigh
citrus
hop
flavor
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
enjoy
this
brew
quite
a
bit
a
very
good
house
ale
something
i
enjoy
having
my
fridge
at

an

a
decent
execution
of

style
but
i
wish
their
was
more
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
this
is
a
standard
drinker
about
average
as
they
come
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
not
bad
in
a
sampler
pack
ive
always
thought
summits
epa
or
just
epa
to
its
loyalists
to
be
a
bit
more
challenging
than
a
true
gateway
or
training
wheels
craftmicro
brew
and
i
still
feel
this
way
many
firsttimers
feel
epa
to
be
a
bit
too
chewy
and
that
first
impression
remains
with
a
few
of
them
ever
after
as
for
myself
ive
enjoyed
so
much
of
this
fine
brew
over
the
past
twenty
years
that
it
hardly
impinges
upon
my
sessioning
as
such
but
i
will
acknowledge
its
heft
and
complexity
to
the
palate
of
the
many
many
neophytes
its
a
great
beer
to
cut
your
aleteeth
on
there
has
also
always
been
an
excellent
hop
profile
to
epa
something
that
initially
snares
the
pilsenerlovers
for
one
and
reels
them
in
only
to
later
confounded
them
with
the
mildlyfruity
characteristics
of
ale
not
a
light
or
thin
brew
at
all
but
a
long
ways
from
a
strong
ale
and
lacking
in
the
richer
malt
complexity
of
certain
of
the
british
renditions
id
call
this
the
hall
monitor
of
ales
to
whit
once
youve
passed
the
gateway
once
youve
left
the
training
wheels
at
home
summit
epa
will
be
the
beer
to
keep
you
on
track
through
the
sometimes
weedy
sometimes
downright
rough
halls
of
aledom
wheres
perry
king
also
from
its
looks
alone
epa
could
pass
for
an
allmalt
amber
lager
ala
boston
lager
and
ive
often
seen
folks
mistake
two
freshlypoured
taps
of
these
in
a
dimlylit
bar
with
a
hilarious
result
am
i
waxing
nostalgic
already
yes
apologies
allaround
and
my
sincere
apologies
to
mr
grossman
and
his
fine
flagship
ale
but
my
sense
of
hometown
pride
would
be
sorely
abused
if
i
didnt
admit
that
i
prefer
our
local
300
lb
gorilla
to
his
900
lb
offering
fact
is
summit
was
the
first
american
pale
ale
id
tried
and
remains
my
personal
benchmark
for
the
style
the
fact
that
i
can
get
this
in
50
of
the
bars
in
minnesota
in
one
form
or
another
and
usually
quite
fresh
and
with
clean
lines
only
makes
me
prouder
of
the
work
that
the
folks
at
summit
have
done
over
the
years
all
of
this
being
said
isnt
it
about
time
they
released
that
barleywine
squirreledaway
in
horace
and
damiens
collective
noggin
the
beer
could
be
a
little
old
but
its
still
showing
a
good
amount
of
its
character
and
its
alright
plug
in
a
few
extra
points
for
a
more
fresh
bottles
and
give
it
a
whirl
sometime
in
terms
of
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
enough
to
drink
several
of
but
i
didnt
really
want
another
overall
impression
this
one
is
lost
on
me
i
dont
see
anything
extra
about
it
i
think
id
look
for
other
apas
there
are
too
many
good
ones
out
there
to
revisit
this
one
whats
the
difference
between
extra
pale
ale
and
a
standard
apa
not
sure
but
this
offering
from
summit
is
a
nice
addition
to
a
summer
repertoire
in
any
event
sharp
dry
toasty
bitterness
but
almost
a
little
thick
rather
than
clean
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
tancopper
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
lacing
that
loves
to
hang
around
the
smell
is
subtle
but
is
of
pale
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
good
almost
citrusy
like
grapefruit
with
a
definite
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
enjoyable
light
on
the
palate
but
creamy
with
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
the
mouth
is
sturdy
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
for
this
style
very
easy
drinker
and
my
favorite
from
this
brewer
sessionable
to
the
max
i
will
seek
this
easy
drinker
out
again
overall
impression
very
drinkable
glad
to
see
this
available
in
the
colorado
market
on
tap
at
the
summit
brewing
company
poured
copper
colored
with
a
medium
white
head
that
didnt
last
the
smell
was
your
basic
malthops
onetwo
punch
combo
taste
you
guessed
it
bready
malt
and
herbal
hops
no
hidden
prizes
or
second
chance
drawings
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
with
average
cabonation
drinkability
was
also
average
this
beer
is
pretty
much
your
average
craft
pale
ale
calling
it
extra
is
somewhat
ironic
because
if
found
it
to
be
average
in
every
way
poured
out
the
bottle
this
beer
displays
an
attractive
head
of
foam
that
takes
awhile
to
settle
out
the
aroma
herbal
with
a
very
grassy
almost
sour
note
to
it
this
beer
has
some
pleasant
toasted
malt
flavors
towards
the
middle
and
a
fairly
assertive
bitter
finish
that
lingers
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
this
beer
something
about
this
bottle
tastes
just
slightly
odd
though
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
i
think
this
bottle
might
be
a
bit
old
the
hops
are
there
they
just
seem
a
bit
faded
overall
a
decent
but
rather
pedestrian
pale
ale
i
did
like
this
better
than
their
ipa
it
was
much
better
balanced
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
massive
shite
puffy
head
very
good
retention
smell
is
mainly
malt
with
a
slight
hoppy
presence
also
to
be
found
taste
follows
through
on
the
smell
with
a
strong
maltiness
and
only
some
mild
hops
present
nice
full
mouuthfeel
very
drinkable
an
enjoyable
beer
extra
pale
ale
is
this
the
new
word
for
weak
pale
ale
if
so
then
this
review
will
be
easy
this
beer
is
a
watery
sierra
nevada
pale
aleend
of
review
i
guess
they
brewed
a
regular
old
pale
ale
and
threw
in
twice
as
much
water
then
market
it
as
something
special
genius
actually
the
beer
tastes
fine
from
the
tap
but
the
undermalted
underhoped
blandness
lets
metalic
grain
grassy
fizzy
character
show
from
the
aroma
to
the
finish
i
can
drink
it
but
really
prefer
better
anyway
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
nice
mouthfull
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
smells
of
pine
and
has
that
same
taste
with
fruity
overtones
nicely
hopped
without
being
overpowered
not
as
dangerous
as
an
ipa
hops
begin
to
mellow
as
it
warms
reveiling
more
of
a
malty
smoothness
great
out
of
a
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
or
on
tap
this
is
my
go
to
beer
for
all
occasions
because
it
makes
a
good
session
beer
and
works
with
all
kinds
of
food
take
a
tour
and
try
it
at
its
best
for
free
the
nose
was
that
of
an
evergreen
that
grows
citrus
fruits
the
colour
was
a
reddish
tinge
more
of
an
amber
really
all
similarities
in
my
mind
to
a
pale
ale
ended
there
when
i
first
sipped
this
ale
very
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
or
light
the
oily
piney
bitter
taste
i
expected
never
appeared
sure
its
more
bitter
than
a
brown
ale
or
a
porter
but
for
an
american
pale
ale
this
was
quite
mild
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
frothy
head
about
a
half
inch
clears
out
to
a
small
covering
aromas
are
fairly
clean
sweet
bready
malts
floral
hops
flavors
of
stinging
hops
ekgs
followed
by
its
clean
malt
background
this
is
a
basic
apa
if
there
ever
was
one
possibly
almost
too
similiar
to
sn
exceptionally
easy
drinking
would
pair
nicely
with
a
variety
of
summer
foods
bbq
sandwiches
burgers
etc
hop
bitterness
has
a
bit
of
sustain
in
the
mouth
but
only
enough
to
balance
it
out
good
beer
beer
good
drinkability
is
good
as
well
especially
when
it
starts
to
warm
up
cheers
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
pale
ale
thats
not
quite
a
classic
like
snpa
but
it
goes
well
with
a
variety
of
food
and
is
great
on
its
own
i
think
this
was
a
good
choice
for
coming
back
to
beer
its
not
the
endallbeall
of
ales
or
even
of
pale
ales
but
it
reminds
one
why
beer
is
such
a
great
thing
its
got
bold
flavor
but
its
not
so
overpowering
you
couldnt
kick
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
which
i
did
a
great
beer
for
people
who
want
to
work
their
way
into
ipas
d
the
big
hops
had
a
nice
complexity
and
a
smooth
malt
flavor
in
the
background
this
is
my
drinking
beer
always
a
case
on
hand
so
good
on
hot
days
i
love
the
hoppy
aftertaste
i
like
other
pale
ales
but
this
is
just
so
good
all
the
time
wether
from
tap
or
bottle
mmm
you
can
drink
it
at
any
temp
but
best
real
cold
i
need
to
get
some
more
really
sessionable
ale
imho
pretty
impressed
i
must
say
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
pint
pours
a
deep
rich
bronze
color
decent
foam
head
smells
sweet
definitive
hop
aromas
slight
nut
malt
flavor
citrusfruit
and
of
course
the
hops
great
body
and
sweet
caramely
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
pale
ale
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
looks
to
be
a
deep
transparent
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
smells
well
there
isnt
much
there
a
few
hops
but
pretty
week
in
the
nose
taste
is
pretty
good
a
floral
hoppiness
combined
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
overall
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
12
oz
stubby
pours
a
solid
deep
copper
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
light
film
over
top
clarity
is
as
good
as
it
gets
and
no
apparent
carbonation
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
very
good
looking
beer
here
nose
is
pretty
nice
good
interplay
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
moderately
dominant
citrusy
hops
with
light
peppery
hop
character
as
well
flavor
is
nice
as
well
caramel
malts
are
dominant
with
a
touch
of
fruityness
in
there
a
citrusy
hop
comes
through
moderately
with
very
nice
flavor
finishing
with
just
a
moderate
bitterness
but
very
clean
there
is
a
light
metallic
tinge
to
the
beer
its
not
bad
but
doesnt
meld
well
with
the
other
flavors
feel
is
a
solid
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
the
feel
is
really
nice
and
i
like
how
the
carbonation
breaks
it
up
its
substantial
but
not
overbearing
this
one
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
would
be
an
easy
session
beer
for
me
as
its
just
not
strong
any
way
around
and
it
doesnt
make
me
feel
full
this
one
is
nice
at
the
age
of
24
i
have
already
had
so
much
of
this
stuff
to
drink
it
is
local
around
here
so
whenever
i
go
to
a
new
bar
before
i
see
their
beer
list
i
ask
for
either
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
or
a
summit
epa
this
isnt
going
to
knock
anyones
socks
off
but
it
is
really
good
for
what
i
just
described
a
good
beer
to
sit
and
relax
with
after
work
it
has
got
a
pretty
good
lighter
brown
color
it
goes
down
easy
just
enough
hops
for
a
epa
refreshing
and
smooth
its
nice
to
have
a
local
beer
that
can
be
this
good
of
a
standard
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
that
we
are
lucky
to
have
up
here
in
the
twin
cities
very
well
balanced
in
taste
and
drinkability
very
affordable
and
very
available
locally
support
your
local
brew
economy
this
beer
poured
a
light
toned
copper
color
with
a
moderate
sized
head
it
smelled
of
roasted
malts
and
maybe
some
english
caramel
the
taste
was
bitter
at
first
then
smoothed
out
and
rather
light
i
found
it
to
be
a
slighty
unenjoyable
beer
and
its
bitteness
kept
it
from
getting
good
points
on
the
drinkablility
stubby

lots
of

bubbles
and
thin
line
of
lacing
along
the

aroma
is

the

was
the
perfect
match
to
my
meal
a

sandwich
covered
in
caramelized

and

blue
cheese
the
pale
ale
cut
through
the
strong
flavors
and
cleansed
the
palate
very
drinkable
sessional
or
accompaniment
to
spicy
full
flavored
food
im
glad
i
found
this
one
summit
truly
is
a
hitormiss
brewery
for
me
luckily
this
one
is
a
keeper
drinkability
this
can
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
even
though
it
claims
to
be
5
10abv
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
so
be
careful
again
the
perfect
balance
and
smoothness
will
not
tire
any
one
sense
so
it
is
easy
to
drink
multiple
bottles
this
is
a
drinkable
apa
the
abv
seemed
just
right
and
the
flavors
left
me
interested
to
grab
another
which
i
did
i
think
ill
probably
drink
about
3
or
4
tonight
good
drinkability
and
another
solid
offering
from
summit
da
wonderful
beer
and
it
is
what
i
choose
for
long
drinking
sessions
it
has
been
my
favorite
session
beer
since
moving
to
minnesota
from
atlanta
in
the
early
90s
it

a

the
palate
to

if
its
available
you
need
to
try
it
this
beer
came
a
light
amber
with
a
thin
slightly
tan
head
smelled
of
grapefruit
pine
and
popcorn
tasted
of
sweet
grapefruit
wheat
grains
green
grapes
and
had
a
very
nice
smooth
yet
dry
hop
flavor
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
full
mouth
of
small
bubbles
this
came
with
a
good
white
head
that
produced
decent
retention
throughout
it
was
a
deep
yellowlight
gold
in
color
the
nose
had
a
lightly
grassy
hop
smell
i
noted
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
slightly
bitter
but
still
pleasant
definitely
a
good
drinking
beer
and
with
the
relatively
low
abv
a
candidate
for
a
session
beer
pours
an
orangecopper
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
frothy
layer
of
head
smells
of
hops
floral
hops
the
taste
is
good
a
really
fine
tasting
ale
here
a
nice

flavor
with
slight
malt
characteristics
and
a
tiny
bit
of
sourness
near
the
end
finishes
dry
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
average
and
the
drinkability
is
great
this
one
goes
down
quick
and
easy
id
be
happy
drinking
several
of
these
nice
offering
here
probably
my
favorite
from
summit
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
very
pleasant
and
clean
apa
to
me
it
is
on
the
same
level
as
snpa
a
great
everyday
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
at
least
it
was
when
i
lived
in
wisconsin
ill
look
for
this
in

to
try
it

a

more
good

this
brew
is
more
flavorful
than
the
india
pale
ale
i
had
the
other
day
recommended
the
beer
has
a
very
light
body
with
a
crisp
carbonated
feel
but
still
packs
a
good
dose
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
makes
a
great
summer
drinker
on
first
sip
is
light
caramel
over
a
soft
malty
body
then
countered
by
a
snappy
highly
floral
hop
burst
with
earthy
pungent
and
quite
drying
but
slakingly
so
sometimes
a
subtle
tea
flavor
comes
out
light

mouthfeel
accentuates
the
dryness
unfortunately
too
floral
and
biting
for
my
tastes
pours
orangecopper
with
a
thick
foamy
head
aroma
of
spicy
hops
was
kind
of
weak
flavor
is
focused
squarely
on
the
herbal
peppery
hop
character
a
bit
of
breadlike
malt
sweetness
shows
up
before
the
bitter
hop
finish
a
decent
pale
ale
and
quite
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
exciting
worth
a
try
a
clean

beer
has
a
small
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
light
bready
character
with
a
peppery

background
the
taste
starts
with
a
quick
sharp
bite
of
peppery
hops
followed
by
s
light
nut
sweet
malt
note
and
a
dry
hop
finish
a
little
different
but
quite
pleasing
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
but
not
very
strong
the
taste
thankfully
is
fuller
than
the
smell
big
and
fruity
with
a
mildly
hoppy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
always
a
top
notch
standby
as
it
is
carried
by
most
drinking
establishments
in
the
minnesota
area
a
nice
amber
colored
beer
with
a
decent
head
smells
of
fragarnt
fruity
hops
and
a
twinge
of
citrus
fruit
it
has
a
metallic
taste
to
it
that
i
wish
wasnt
there
but
it
is
still
a
nice
light
malty
brew
with
a
refreshing
splash
of
hops
that
livens
up
the
palate
a
good
session
brew
if
only
i
didnt
taste
the
metal
as
much
i
really
liked
the
way
this
beer
was
put
together
the
overall
effect
was
very
satisfying
i
sampled
this
backtoback
with
summits
ipa
the
the
hopping
difference
was
striking
the
ipa
hopping
was
rather
blunt
whereas
this
extra
pale
ale
had
a
very
nice
dimension
of
fruityness
in
the
hops
a
very
long
flavor
profile
the
hops
hit
early
and
carried
through
to
the
end
of
the
taste
a
bit
flowery
up
front
but
then
thinning
and
going
a
bit
lemony
citric
toward
the
end
with
some
sourness
developing
that
was
very
engaging
very
good
not
in
a
knockyoursocksoff
sort
of
way
but
in
an
easydrinking
session
ale
way
summit
never
blows
me
away
but
never
fails
to
please
considering
the
low
price
this
is
always
worth
it
and
makes
a
good
stock
beer
cheers
summit
extra
pale
is
a
great
local
pour
copper
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
hops
give
it
a
grapefruitcitric
aroma
and
its
balanced
out
quite
well
by
the
malt
since
its
local
and
available
in
the
twin
cities
its
a
great
reliable
session
beer
perhaps
im
a
bit
biased
but
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
apas
around
seems
like
everyone
got
the
summit
variety
pack
while
i
liked
them
all
the
extra
pale
impressed
me
the
most
compared
to
what
i
was
expecting
i
anticipated
an
easy
drinking
lighter
beer
with
little
flavor
however
this
is
one
of
the
more
flavorable
pales
ive
had
recently
nicely
balanced
with
a
touch
of
hops
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
drinkability
very
good
a
decent
enrty
level
apa
for
someone
just
entering
the
world
of
better
beer
i
think
i
said
about
the
same
for
the
ipa
not
overthetop
hoppy
or
too
malty
well
balance
beer
imo
this
is
one
of
my
regular
brews
in
the
fridge
and
the
beer
i
use
in
recipes
calling
for
beer
i
like
this
beer
and
although
it
is
not
perfect
it
is
darn
tasty
and
satisfying
to
most
of
the
craft
brew
drinkers
i
know
the
numbers
say
it
well
i
like
this
summit
the
extra
pale
pours
a
good
looking
ambercopper
a
rich
thick
chewy
look
as
a
slight
haze
appears
with
it
the
head
is
pillow
like
solid
and
retains
well
lace
is
great
all
glass
long
as
a
white
web
follows
the
brew
of
liquid
the
aroma
is
citric
sweet
and
of
a
slight
hop
the
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
of
sweet
malt
and
citric
hop
the
mouth
is
left
crisp
as
a
slight
hop
lingers
on
awhile
the
drinkability
oh
ya
a
good
mix
that
goes
well
with
itself
and
a
meal
its
malts
are
sweet
enough
and
its
hops
are
crisp
clean
and
provide
a
good
blend
of
tastes
slightly
hazy

very
good

not
much
else
slightly
toasted

combined
with

flavor
not
a
great
amount
of
either
why
is
this
xtra
pale
seemed
a
bit
thin
althoug
carbonation
was
ok
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
not
xtra
pale
more
like
english
pale
still
decent
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
fact
i
had
about
6
pints
of
it
over
the
course
of
2
days
in
the
minneapolis
area
a
very
solid
selection
if
youre
in
the
area
pours
out
a
deep
amber
with
a
distinctly
orangish
hue
very
small
offwhite
head
that
nearly
instantly
disappeared
though
i
believe
i
may
have
underaggressively
poured
this
one
some
small
amounts
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
but
limited
due
to
the
low
head
generation
smell
is
yeasty
with
some
clear
citrus
notes
also
a
very
small
amount
of
hop
floral
character
as
an
understated
backdrop
pleasant
but
not
overwhelming
taste
is
of
well
balanced
maltiness
up
front
followed
by
distinctly
bitter
hop
tones
the
bitterness
seems
to
also
have
notes
of
orange
peel
or
other
citrusgenerated
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
somewhat
sour
overall
a
very
good
very
complex
balance
of
flavors
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
and
carbonation
is
quite
high
not
quite
beyond
the
line
into
overcarbonation
but
definitely
on
the
high
side
this
offering
seems
to
be
fairly
drinkable
and
would
welcome
the
opportunity
to
have
more
a
worthy
choice
taste
has
a
lean
malt
backingcrisp
clean
hops
are
citrusy
grapefruit
and
refreshing
not
bad
but
could
benefit
from
some
added
malt
character
lightmedium
bodied
snappy
and
drinkable
ive
had
summit
epa
ontap
countless
times
as
its
often
the
best
choice
at
many
twin
citiessuburban
restaurants
and
i
must
say
its
definitely
better
that
way
the
hops
seem
fresher
and
the
malt
more
substantial
i
guess
ill
have
to
do
a
separate
review
summits
version
of
a
pale
ale
isnt
bad
but
neither
does
it
stand
out
in
any
way
even
the
label
is
unexciting
i
hate
to
be
too
hard
on
this
beer
but
it
screams
average
yeah
my
average
is
greater
than
3
0
so
sue
me
yours
is
too
picked
it
up
via
the
midwest
taster
it
was
probably
my
favorite
out
of
the
six
samples
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
honeyamber
with
a
small
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
head
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
layer
the
nose
displays
light
hops
and
some
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
good
but
finishes
with
a
good
deal
of
harsh
bitterness
and
leaves
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
body
is
light
and
a
bit
thin
overall
its
a
decently
drinkable
brew
final
thought
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
apa
from
the
midwest
not
a
burning
river
or
alpha
king
but
it
is
a
solid
contender
in
any
case
if
you
want
a
beer
that
is
fairly
available
that
is
really
good
and
if
you
like
this
more
bitter
hoppy
style
then
this
is
definitely
worth
buying
this
is
my
hands
down
favorite
beer
i
buy
more
of
this
amber
ambrosia
than
any
other
beer
the
aroma
and
familiar
taste
keeps
me
warm
during
the
winter
and
cool
during
the
summer
it
is
like
my
security
blanket
i
love
the
hop
and
malt
balance
it
makes
my
head
spin
or
is
that
the
alcohol
if
you
like
a
pale
ale
that
is
drinkable
and
not
trying
to
outhop
the
next
brew
then
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
great
minnesotan
ale
smell
is
very
malty
with
just
a
faint
note
of
citrusy
hops
taste
is
very
indistinct
its
not
very
hoppy
or
malty
sort
of
bland
mouthfeel
is
decent
however
drinkability
suffers
a
little
because
theres
nothing
that
leaves
me
wanting
to
try
or
buy
one
again
this
might
be
a
good
crossover
beer
to
convert
some
macroloving
friends
and
its
good
in
a
pinch
but
with
so
many
other
options
available
ill
seek
out
something
else
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
and
ok
lace
smells
were
very
faint
but
i
did
pick
up
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
taste
is
much
hoppier
than
its
smell
leads
you
to
believe
its
not
too
hoppy
but
enough
to
make
a
nice
apa
fairly
well
balanced
for
the
style
with
some
nice
swwet
malt
and
caramel
flavors
slightly
spicy
clean
and
crisp
finishes

i
could
drink
several
of

i
was

it
did

was
domiknated
by
a

with
a

certainly

12oz

poured
into

it

a

with

there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
malty
and
grassy
with
a
touch
of
hops
a
fairly
well
balanced
nose
the
taste
starts
with
a
good
caramel
maltiness
nice
and
smooth
a
little
bit
of
a
yeast
taste
too
the
finish
has
a
good
dose
of
piney
hops
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
fairs
good
as
well
a
nice
apa
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
the
bitterness
is
a
little
too
strong
medicinal
for
my
taste
today
but
is
appropriate
to
the
style
this
is
a
nice
compromise
between
the
english
style
hops
and
oakiness
balanced
by
the
cleaner

wow
i
went
to
a
house
party
at
the
u
of
m
and
to
my
suprise
summit
pale
ale
was
on
tap
i
was
shocked
normally
this
place
only
has
busch
light
what
a
score
after
drinking
bld
all
night
summit
pale
ale
was
amazing
i
went
up
to
their
tap
expecting
to
see
piss
colored
beer
come
out
but
to
my
suprise
it
was
a
copper
colored
wonder
i
really
hope
the
guys
who
threw
the
party
made
alot
of
money
for
taking
a
risk
and
spending
the
extra
money
a
bit
of
spicy
citrus
hops
fairly
routine
aromatically
speaking
snappy
little
flavor
though
starts
with
a
mushy
sort
of
malt
flavor
finishes
with
a
clear
focus
on
the
hops
another
standard
goodbutnotspectacular
take
on
the
style
but
thats
hardly
a
criticism
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
suspect
that
if
it
were
readily
available
id
be
slamming
this
as
a
session
brew
all
the
time
poured
a
copperyamber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
lightly
carbonated
with
a
sweet
floral
aroma
the
initial
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
even
a
bit
syrupy
but
then
it
sort
of
fizzles
out
altogether
leaving
an
acidy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
nothing
about
it
is
overpowering
which
is
probably
why
it
remains
drinkable
despite
the
average
and
wanting
flavor
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
but
its
not
on
my
must
have
list
like
a
couple
other
twin
cities
bas
this
is
my
trusty
session
beer
summit
is
a
well
made
interesting
and
easy
drinking
ale
it
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
think
head
which
dissapates
into
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
isnt
overpowering
but
pleasant
with
citrusy
hops
and
bit
of
malt
the
taste
isnt
overly
complex
but
very
well
balanced
the
hops
have
a
bit
of
grapefuit
flavor
to
start
and
linger
with
a
hint
of
flowery
finish
that
seems
to
rest
on
the
ample
malt
base
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
i
enjoy
the
flavor
throughout
this
beer
or
two
or
three
this
may
not
impress
hopheads
who
expect
an
ale
to
smack
them
in
the
mouth
but
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
well
crafted
balanced
quaffable
brew
should
check
this
one
out
in
my
experience
better
from
a
bottle
than
on
tap
a
decent
beer
not
bad
but
not
good
very
forgetable
much
finer
offerings
out
there
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
soon
gives
way
to
a
sticky
and
bubbly
lace
nose
is
fresh
citrus
fruit
with
some
strong
notes
of
buttery
malts
medium
in
body
with
a
rather
fine
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
crisp
mouthfeel
taste
begins
with
flavors
of
fresh
grapefruit
followed
by
spicy
and
bitter
hop
oils
all
the
while
balanced
by
a
nice
malt
backbone
finish
is
dry
with
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
a
pretty
nice
pale
ale
to
be
had

i
was
vastly
mistaken
in
my
first
review
of
the
epa
since
i
developed
a
love
of
hops
i
must
include
this
on
the
short
list
of
my
favorite
pas
very
tasty
i
feel
guitly
for
the
weak
review
i
initially
gave
it
nice
to
see
a
larger
craft
brewer
whose
flagship
brand
is
not
the
usual
pale
pilsner
and
nice
to
see
that
its
readily
available
on
tap
in
the
twin
cities
where
i
tasted
this
its
even
on
a
few
taps
here
in
chicago
a
pleasing
ambercopper
color
toasty
malty
sweetness
and
a
refined
hop
spiciness
definitely
not
ipa
level
but
enough
to
tell
the
novice
beer
drinker
theres
another
world
out
there
great
with
those
matts
hamburgers
with
the
cheese
fried
inside
the
patty
a
minneapolis
tradition
my
brother
introduced
me
to
summit
pale
ale
is
a
wonderful
every
day
ale
it
is
extremely
drinkable
with
low
carbonation
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
a
fine
hoppy
ale
but
i
keep
returning
to
it
it
runs
1112
per
twelve
pack
less
on
sale
and
you
can
not
drink
just
one
it
is
on
tap
in
many
decent
bars
in
the
minneapolis
st
paul
area
and
is
a
better
choice

this
is

out
with
a

of
gree
grassy
hop
bitterness
just
enough
of
a
hop
finish
to
make
you
want
to
drink
more
a
solid
pale
ale
with
good
drinkability
an
amber
color
not
very
pale
with
a
nice
starting
head
that
diminishes
quickly
and
a
good
presence
of
lace
a
hoppy
aroma
initially
and
then
of
bread
and
some
caramel
smooth
mouth
feel
a
light
slightly
sweet
taste
with
a
dry
finish
not
a
very
distinctive
or
memorable
taste
but
a
good
mouth
feel
and
fairly
drinkable
thanks
to
bighuge
for
this
one
this
bottle
was
definitely
bonedry
before
it
got
recycled
cant
complain
about
the
drinkability
of
this
though
a
very
smooth
ale
indeed
and
it
would
make
a
very
passable
session
ale
for
a
session
when
no
one
involved
intends
to
drive
any
time
soon
warms
to
a
taste
just
like
the
pour
or
possibly
even
more
watery
and
muddled
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
indeed
with
an
excellent
amount
of
carbonation
balancing
the
liquid
overall
an
alright
beer
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
no
to
one
but
not
a
clear
winner
a
small
offwhite
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
body
was
carbonated
and
slightly
cloudy
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
copper
and
the
lacing
was
fair
the
nose
was
hoppy
fruity
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
was
very
bitter
and
it
had
a
fore
and
an
aftertaste
that
lingered

cheers
ive
had
this
one
a
million
times
just
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
i
found
it
to
be
a
decent
apa
it
pours
to
a

color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
citric
hops
the
flavor
is
fruity
that
of
citrus
and

zest
it
also
has
a
bit
of
bready
malt
flavor
it
finishes
dry
and
bitter
i
very
drinkable
apa
very
crisp
this
is
a
brew
i
go
to
because
of
its
availability
i
can
find
it
at
any
liquor
store
around
the
area
this
is
the
second
beer
from
summit
that
ive
tried
thanks
again
mr

as
with
the
ipa
this
is
a
good
tasty
ale
nice
appearance
with
some
foamy
head
and
lacing
nice
citrus
hop
smell
and
taste
finishes
a
bit
thin
and
decidedly
bitter
but
i
would
imagine
that
is
just
what
they
intended
as
american
micro
ales
go
i
like
summit
hoppy
yes
but
the
citrus
flavors
still
find
their
way
through
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
styles

it

even
though
the

was
frosted
sniff
was
hoppy
but
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
i
like
the
taste
was
nice
overall
i
still
think
that
this
beer
has
been
reworked
over
the
past
couple
of
years
i
remember
more
of
a
citric
hop
presence
and
bitter
aspect
a
few
years
ago
that
said
it
was
an
enjoyable
brew
drinkability
was
high
as
my
4
in
an
hour
can
attest
to
very
enjoyable
disappointed
with
this
beer
looks
great
smells
good
and
tastes
lame
i
was
expecting
a
hopped
up
american
style
ipa
what
i
got
was
a
hopped
coors
red
very
under
whelming
flavor
from
this
beer
the
only
remarkable
thing
there
was
a
slight
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
i
did
not
feel
like
hunting
for
taste
and
therefore
i
cant
give
this
a
thumbs
up
funny
i
actually
remember
thinking
fairly
highly
of
this
but
it
has
been
awhile
something
must
have
changed
either
in
my
palette
or
this
beer
or
both
i
tried
this
one
a
couple
of
times
on
tap
on
a
recent
trip
it
is
an
attractive
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
the
head
has
a
decent
retention
and
produces
small
bits
of
lace
theres
an
appealing
floral
westcoast
hop
aroma
nice
balance
between
a
sweet
start
and
lingering
bitter
finish
not
great
but
potential
to
be
a
good
regional
session
beer
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lingers
slightly
with
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
crisp
citrus
hop
aroma
with
some
malty
freshness
taste
is
tipped
in
favor
of
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
long
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
in
this
bottle
has
slight
soapiness
to
it
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
gently
yeasty
and
fruity
aroma
is
an
attractive
greeting
followed
immediately
by
a
fullbodied
tangy
taste
that
lingers
and
satisfies
it
becomes
increasingly
integrated
with
the
hops
continuing
to
predominate
as
they
should
the
hop
bitterness
complements
the
grain
undertow
of
this
pale
ale
that
finishes

fluffy

support

as

but
not

an
excellent
pale
ale
definitely
in
a
class
with
sierra
nevada
if
this
beer
is
as
popular
in
minnesota
as
ive
heard
it
speaks
well
for
the
taste
of
the
state
i
like
this
one
a
bit
better
than
the
ipa
a
bit
hoppier
nicer
color
stronger
smell
still
very
drinkable
this
is
the
beer
that
started
my
expedition
into
the
unexplored
pours
out
a
beautiful
dark
amber
and
a
dense
head
which
sticks
as
rings
as
you
gulp
it
down
nice
cascade
hop
aroma
moderate
body
and
the
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of

hops
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
to
provide
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
absolutely
delicious
ive
had
sierra

pale
ale
and
this
is
better
more

and

depth
i
may
be

im
not

im
currently
living
in
minnesota
but
i
wasnt
looking
for
a
beer
this
good
when
i
moved
here
a
really
distinct
example
of
an
american
pale
hoppy
to
be
sure
but
with
a
good
deal
of
nutty
malts
superior
fruitiness
and
a
complexity
all
the
way
to
the
aftertaste
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
tap
but
with
enough
guts
to
last
through
fall
poured
from
12
7

into

lots

toffee

with

very
well

enjoyed
this
brew
an
underrated
and
priceworthy
ale
which
has
a
good
mix
between
hops
and
malt
overall
not
impressed
with
the
flavor
much
more
sparkling
in
flavor
than
obviously
in
appearence
nice
fruitiness
doesnt
overwhelm
the
relatively
light
hops
and
decent
malts
a
good
interpretation
of
an
english
ale
i
would
recommend
to
my
friends
more
bread
malts
with
a
sharp
honey
and
those
coopers
yeasts
overall
a
decent
beer
if
not
my
favourite
australian
beer
ever
there
is
a
reason
that
this
is
one
of
coopers
main
two
brews
for
sale
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
even
though
it
is
fairly
bland
in
flavor
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
would
pair
easily
with
lots
of
different
foods
easy
drinking
but
lots
of
flavour
a
strong
flavoured
beer
and
one
of
our
flagship
mainstream
choices
for
good
reason
an
old
favourite
usually
have
plenty
in
my
fridge
and
its
quite
affordable
too
the
standout
here
is
the
strong
unique
and
wellbalanced
flavour
damn
girl
mmmmm

srsly
work
on

design
dood
asap
xdd
i
had
this
nice
australian
beer
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
illinois
it
pours
cloudy
golden
super
fizzy
because
of
the
high
carbonation
white
head
and
plenty
of
lacings
it
has
a
murky
sediment
body
because
of
the
yeast
content
which
adds
more
flavor
to
this
quality
beer
it
has
the
taste
of
fruit
and
malt
with
pointed
hints
of
floral
and
hops
it
is
light
bodied
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
filling
really
delicate
and
no
edge
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
tiny
particles
of
sediment
are
seen
suspended
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
slight
citruslike
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
floral
and
citrus
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
decent
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
on
this
one
seem
fairly
muted
one
of
the
great
australian
brews
unique
and
bright
like
australia
itself
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
sunny
with
some
yeast
floaters
and
a
large
but
relatively
short
lived
white
head
the
nose
is
clean
and
crisp
like
a
lager
but
with
quite
a
bit
of
hops
pale
and
maybe
even
wheat
malts
a
summer
beer
of
sorts
with
a
good
kick
the
flavor
profile
is
pure
refreshment
the
yeast
and
hops
make
it
much
more
flavorful
than
other
beers
at
this
price
point
and
the
excessive
carbonation
really
wakes
you
up
keeps
you
chipper
and
cleanses
the
palate
great
in
hot
or
cool
weather
on
tap
or
from
the
bottle
this
is
a
versatile
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
australian
brewing
culture
i
really
really
enjoy
this
probably
my
favorite
from
coopers
i
spent
many
an
evening
sucking
these
back
the
floral
hop
profile
is
just
lovely
decent
beer
very
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
more
flavorful
than
a
lager
done
for
the
same
purpose
o
tasty
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
the
initial
amount
of
sediment
as
i
wasnt
expecting
any
but
the
sediment
does
not
detract
at
all
from
the
quality
of
the
beer
id
definitely
give
this
a
try
again
overall
the
body
behind
this
beer
and
weak
palate
sort
of
leaves
me
a
bit
disappointed
but
its
drinkable
and
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
to
have
out
there
for
sure
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
at
first
it
comes
across
like
a
light
lager
but
it
has
a
bit
more
to
it
the
texture
is
awesome
but
the
taste
comes
up
a
little
short
really
nice
refreshing
sparkling
ale
the
sparkling
element
seems
to
be
the
higher
level
of
carbonation
which
isnt
really
what
makes
or
breaks
the
beer
overall
its
got
a
good
taste
some
citrus
notes
and
is
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
enjoyable
beer
with
a
bit
of
attitude
worth
a
try
overall
it
was
quite
refreshing
and
would
go
great
with
a
hot
sunny
day
this
ale
is
very
light
refreshing
lemony
with
a
spritzy
carbonation
that
makes
it
quite
suitable
for
summer
weather
its
a
little
lagery
for
my
tastes
but
still
an
excellent
choice
overall
o
sparkling
ale
is
a
very
apt
description
this
is
a
tasty
beer
made
for
quality
sessioning
coopers
australian
for
prosecco
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
amberbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
grapefruit
peel
mild
toffee
buttery
biscuit
and
a
vague
whiff
of
pine
needle
the
taste
continues
the
grapefruitpine
alliance
but
its
old
due
to
negligence
and
when
it
gets
called
to
action
things
look
their
age
on
the
battlefield
everything
is
old
musty
and
graham
crackery
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
weak
little
pale
ale
with
nothing
memorable
about
it
pours
an
orange
yellow
in
color
with
a
decent
head
at
pour
that
disappates
somewhat
quickly
carbonation
a
bit
more
like
soda
but
some
remnants
do
remain
on
the
top
and
the
rim
of
the
glass
yeast
andor
other
sediment
present
smells
typical
pale
ale
maybe
some
citrus
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
subtle
witbier
qualities
o
a
good
beer
for
summertime
drinking
easy
to
drink
goes
down
very
smooth
light
coopers
sparkling
ale
the
bottle
says
coopers
ales
and
stouts
are
brewed
using
the
centuries
old
top
fermentation
method
and
natural
bottle
conditioning
resulting
in
a
characteristic
fine
sediment
forming
on
the
base
of
the
bottle
this
sediment
is
completely
natural
and
can
be
gently
mixed
before
drinking
or
poured
carefully
leaving
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
lacking
strength
in
both
the
nose
and
the
taste
and
was
a
little
to
sparkling
although
the
name
was
a
giveaway
i
guess
it
was
almost
like
a
cider
in
parts
and
there
was
nothing
particularly
great
about
it
total
3450
o
refreshing
if
anything
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
tasting
sparkling
ale
its
bottle
fermented
like
all
coopers
so
that
you
get
yeast
floating
around
in
your
beer
i
have
to
admit
to
being
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
cant
recommend
it
enough
good
stuff
ok
but
not
too
special
balanced
but
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
quite
dull
and
dominated
by
yeast
esters
perhaps
this
bottle
is
a
bit
too
old
ill
try
and
review
it
again
sometime
no
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
overall
an
interesting
take
on
the
english
pale
ale

i
was
initially
surprised
by
the
amount
of
sediment
as
well
as
the
amount
that
remained
floating
on
top
of
the
head
great
grassy
and
bitter
flavours
a
nice
brew
for
a
summer
day
a
most
welcome
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionableits
not
particularly
flavorful
but
it
sure
goes
down
very
easily
o
as
an
overall
honest
and
unbiased
opinion
the
best
way
i
could
describe
this
beer
would
be
as
an
inoffensive
allrounder
pleasurable
but
by
no
means
outstanding
australian
ale
i
wouldnt
place
this
beer
on
an
elitist
pedestal
nor
would
i
be
apprehensive
to
advocate
this
beer
as
a
good
australian
ale
ive
never
had
the
option
of
purchasing
this
beer
from
a
keg
at
a
pub
but
have
purchased
many
times
at
the
local
liquor
store
in
the
750ml
bottles
the
longnecks
are
great
for
homebrew
and
generally
its
a
good
default
beer
to
serve
to
visiting
friends
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
meals
i
believe
its
a
very
good
beer
for
the
price
and
i
will
continue
to
purchase
this
product
overall
a
good
pale
ale
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
quite
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
drop
which
is
stereotypical
of
many
aussie
brews
o
overall
a
better
than
decent
session
beer
for
the
australian
summers
day
o
this
beer
really
fits
the
territory
i
cant
imagine
enjoying
this
on
a
cold
new
england
night
but
it
really
fits
the
bill
in
oz
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
rjt
o
easy
drinking
pale
not
much
more
not
much
less
o
definitely
a
very
good
choice
from
australia
but
overall
an
average
pale
ale
from
land
down
under
i
would
recommend
it
only
if
youre
in
a
mood
for
something
australian
pours
a
light
gold
color
w
a
one
finger
off
white
head
lots
of
floaties
falling
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
average
lacing
on
the
snifter
glass
very
cloudy
in
appearance
nose
is
pretty
weak
maybe
some
malt
apple
and
banana
thats
about
it
really
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
not
good
either
big
malt
with
even
more
apple
and
banana
in
the
taste
theres
so
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
that
it
feels
like
im
drinking
a
soda
millions
of
little
bubbles
cover
up
just
about
everything
else
thats
going
on
very
light
and
carbonated
feel
w
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
is
not
something
ill
look
for
again
cheers
overall
a
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
beer
slightly
heavy
if
drank
too
fast
but
a
very
pleasing
drink
poured
a
2
white
head
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
colored
body
smells
lightly
of
malt
taste
when
cold
is
mild
malt
and
a
wee
zing
of
an
aftertaste
kind
of
a
bmc
beer
with
a
little
extra
where
this
really
shines
is
as
it
warms
though
it
becomes
creamier
and
velvety
and
has
a
lingering
bitter
finish
quite
enjoyable
other
than
the
fact
it
isnt
really
sparkling
id
say
they
have
a
nice
quality
sparkling
ale
here
one
of
the
best
session
beers
out
there
if
theres
one
thing
the
aussies
know
its
good
beer
thats
easy
to
crush
and
once
again
they
have
proven
their
great
ability
with
this
tasty
session
ale
overall
i
wasnt
too
disappointed
by
this
one
it
was
a
sample
from
my
local
bottle
shop
thanks
bill
and
gwen
not
something
you
should
seek
out
but
not
a
bad
try
cloudy
light
brown
caramel
in
the
glass
looks
inviting
nose
is
a
little
sudued
but
has
some
fruity
slightly
sweet
notes
good
mouthfeel
a
little
plain
in
the
flaour
stakes
but
finishes
ok
with
some
mild
hoppiness
and
bitterness
needs
a
bit
more
omph
to
be
really
interesting
had
the
pale
ale
last
night
and
for
once
probably
showed
better
than
the
red
label
bottom
line
decide
which
you
prefer
before
pouring
or
slowly
decant
half
of
the
bottles
contents
and
then
decide
if
you
want
a
totally
different
taste
sensation
o
solid
beer
would
definitely
have
again
at
or
in
the
outback
not
a
bad
beer
well
what
can
i
say
ive
come
across
this
beer
by
accident
and
i
must
say
im
already
big
fan
of
it
i
am
usually
not
big
fan
of
those
weed
yellowish
looking
ales
i
rather
drink
old
plain
lager
but
this
one
was
a
nice
suprise
the
beer
has
very
rich
in
flavor
and
you
can
feel
the
fullines
in
your
mouth
it
is
sparkling
as
it
claims
and
of
course
you
want
to
drink
freshest
as
possible
and
here
is
my
only
problem
with
it
its
hard
to
get
even
in
those
big
liquor
stores
which
sell
beers
from
around
the
world
however
when
you
look
in
right
direction
you
can
get
yourself
a
nice
setady
suplly
overall
very
good
beer
and
great
escape
from
regularity
you
going
to
like
this
beer
i
certainly
recomend
this
to
anyone
this
is
just
a
great
refreshing
uncomplicated
sparkling
ale
when
i
first
tasted
it
years
ago
i
was
told
that
it
was
the
perfect
lawnmowing
beer
and
thats
quite
accurate
notes
of
grass
and
hard
physical
labor
really
stand
out
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
and
was
done
before
i
realized
a
good
call
especially
if
actual
lawnmowing
is
to
occur
at
some
point
in
the
hopefully
near
future
food
match
the
above
mentioned
barbie
conjures
images
of
steak
sandwichs
sausages
and
potato
salad
if
you
need
something
else
a
tub
of
coleslaw
from
woolies
will
do
the
trick
really
enjoy
this
beer
when
ever
im
at
outback
this
is
my
goto
beer
when
eating
there
the
sparkling
ale
is
rolled
in
the
bartenders
hands
before
pouring
to
shake
up
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
as
the
beer
is
poured
it
had
a
really
nice
golden
color
to
it
with
a
strong
looking
white
head
the
yeast
is
visible
has
the
carbonation
tosses
it
around
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
mostly
grainy
nothing
overly
special
there
but
it
is
pleasant
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
nice
malt
character
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
it
can
fill
you
up
with
a
good
meal
for
sure
overall
i
love
the
preperation
of
the
beer
and
the
the
look
of
it
its
one
of
my
favorites
from
australia
for
sure
overall
i
quite
liked
this
beer
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
o
an
interesting
beer
that
id
like
to
try
again
but
a
bit
fresher
next
time
to
see
if
there
is
much
difference
faint
grittiness
to
the
mouthfeel
from
the
sediment
which
also
creates
a
decent
body
in
spite
of
the
relatively
low
carbonation
its
also
very
easygoing
given
its
abv
very
crisp
and
dry
finish
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
in
aus
not
really
an
english
pale
ale
tho
is
it
d
very
easy
drinking
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
taste
is
good
but
i
almost
like
the
aroma
even
better
on
this
one
there
is
lots
of
fruitiness
zest
in
here
pretty
much
enjoyable
and
worthy
to
give
it
a
try
this
came
across
as
a
pale
ale
and
a
champagne
mixed
together
not
enough
hops
for
me
to
call
it
a
pale
ale
but
it
had
enough
balance
to
be
enjoyable
its
coopers
sparkling
what
more
can
you
say
a
beacon
of
tasty
malty
yeasty
goodness
that
has
stood
out
amongst
so
many
barren
cub
dominated
pubs
a
quintessentially
australian
beer
i
have
a
real
soft
spot
for
this
beer
one
of
the
first
beers
i
really
enjoyed
dr
a
bit
pricey
but
i
assume
this
is
only
in
ireland
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
and
its
style
had
this
at
outback
so
the
glass
is
so
fucking
frozen
i
cant
a
good
look
at
the
body
it
seems
to
be
orange
with
a
super
foamy
head
that
shrunk
quickly
aroma
is
sweet
and
carmelly
with
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
like
a
weird
amber
ale
sweetness
is
caramelly
but
annoying
weird
but
not
awful
not
really
for
me
in
a
hot
climate
this
would
be
okay
to
drink
for
refreshment
but
i
found
it
lacking
in
taste
not
sure
if
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
with
how
effervescent
it
is
but
it
is
quite
enjoyable
and
im
pleased
to
recommend
it
pours
a
pale
gold
medium
sticky
white
head
decent
lace
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
fair
bit
of
sediment
in
the
glass
aromas
of
malt
biscuit
slight
citrus
hop
and
something
that
resembles
but
isnt
roasted
corn
are
present
here
tastes
malty
with
mild
floral
hop
slight
alcohol
apple
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
decent
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
slightly
creamy
aggressive
carbonation
that
was
a
bit
much
for
me
but
i
think
thats
what
they
were
going
for
drinks
well
approachable
and
something
i
would
revisit
one
day
drinkability
is
high
with
a
low
price
and
fair
quality
beer
one
of
my
staple
beers
d
very
drinkable
in
just
about
any
occasion
drainpour
ill
give
it
a
1
5
instead
of
a
1
because
though
i
did
drainpour
it
i
made
it
through
most
of
the
bottle
first
drinkability
good
beer
very
drinkable
with
no
over
powering
flavors
very
light
a
good
summer
or
session
beer
finally
i
could
drink
copious
quantities
of
this
sparkling
ale
lots
of
good
flavours
and
not
a
high
price
tag
when
it
comes
to
the
abv
just
generally
very
enjoyable
overall
a
great
epa
and
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
with
a
twistoff
cap
it
might
be
something
id
give
my
typical
lager
drinking
friends
to
try
if
wanting
to
introduce
them
to
the
world
of
ales
yet
at
the
same
time
its
delicious
for
me
and
possesses
some
subtle
complexities
to
keep
me
interested
and
drinking
more
d
overall
a
wonderfully
enjoyable
beer
and
an
extremely
drinkable
epa
well
balanced
but
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
i
will
certainly
pick
some
of
this
up
again
drinkability
i
could
put
this
one
in
my
lineup
a
good
middleofthenight
beer
for
sure
ill
start
off
by
saying
that
this
is
tied
for
the
best
epa
ive
ever
had
the
bottle
conditioning
of
this
beer
does
wonders
for
it
from
appearance
to
mouthfeel
but
especially
drinkability
thumbs
way
up
on
this
one
drinkability
this
was
an
easily
drinkable
beer
with
one
sip
following
another
easily
and
it
was
gone
much
sooner
than
i
had
planned
i
would
be
quite
happy
to
have
had
another
and
if
i
return
to
australia
ill
be
happy
to
sample
this
one
again
coopers
sparkling
ale
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
no
foam
and
tons
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
lemon
and
wheat
followed
by
a
bitter
lemon
and
vanilla
flavor
its
got
a
thin
mouthfeel
very
dry
and
leaves
a
bit
of
a
burn
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
way
too
bitter
to
drink
more
than
one
not
recommended
light
head
of
one
finger
that
evaporated
to
clinging
lace
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm

apple
cider
is
the
first
thing
i
smell
there
is
also
some
pear
and
plum
some
malt
and
roasted

taste
has
overtones
of
citrus
apple
plum
lemon
peel
malt
and
wheat
full
body
feeling
around
my
mouth
and
down
my
throat
crisp
light
and
good
flavor
this
is
a
brew
i
would
like
to
drink
again
i
bet
this
is
delicious
if
you
get
it
in
australia
travels
better
than
most
beers
though
its
an
exceptional
beer
pours
a
murky
pale
orange
colour
with
very
bubbly
white
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
and
ok
head
retention
smells
of
bready
malt
hops
metal
and
cooked
vegetables
mild
bitterness
in
the
flavour
but
some
off
flavours
as
well
more
carbonation
than
id
like
in
an
pale
ale
i
dont
know
if
freshness
is
the
issue
here
but
it
says
best
before
may
2012
on
the
bottle
and
it
was
kept
in
the
fridge
section
at
the
control
board
in
ontario
so
i
have
to
imagine
it
was
fresh
value
at
9
99
per
sixer
this
is
a
good
buy
plus
you
get
that
extra
0
7
fl
oz
per
bottle
yes
m
refreshing
tasting
for
an
ale
good
ending
a
little
too
bitter
but
long
enough
d
you
will
want
more
than
one
nevertheless
its
still
made
clear
that
the
australians
learned
a
thing
or
two
from
their
british
ancestors
when
it
comes
to
crafting
mild
and
sessionable
beers
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
offering
youd
want
to
find
fresh
on
cask
at
your
local
pub
having
it
stale
and
battered
in
bottle
shipped
from
the
other
side
of
the
planet
is
less
ideal
but
still
alright
mouthfeel
was
a
disappointment
after
the
name
sparkling
and
the
big
head
i
was
expecting
some
ongoing
carbonation
to
tickle
the
tongue
the
beer
was
not
watery
but
there
is
little
crispness
and
no
extra
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
average
this
is
not
an
exceptional
beer
in
any
sense
although
its
not
mindblowingly
amazing
coopers
sparkling
is
a
pretty
damn
good
standard
ive
drunk
it
many
a
time
and
im
sure
i
will
continue
to
note
i
am
australian
and
the
standard
coopers
pale
ale
in
aus
is
in
a
green
bottle
and
slightly
different
i
guess
this
stuff
is
for
export
only
pours
to
hazy
orangegold
color
and
sudsy
white
head
that
lasts
aroma
is
fruity
hoppy
and
slightly
malty
flavor
is
fruity
estery
somewhat
citrusy
and
balanced
with
a
dose
of
bittering
hops
and
some
lingering
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
but
rough
has
a
very
homebrewy
vibe
to
it
overall
a
solid
beer
that
has
no
frills
or
pretensions
it
is
what
i
would
call
a
good
ale
drink
im
happy
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
a
nice
refreshing
beer
due
to
the
carbonation
and
lemon
flavours
id
purchase
it
again
its
a
nice
brew
this
one
certainly
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
not
something
thats
going
to
wow
you
but
its
something
that
you
could
keep
going
with
all
night
d
average
beer
goes
good
with
hamburgers
this
an
imminently
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
far
too
many
over
the
years
but
maybe
that
is
because
there
is
not
a
lot
going
on
with
it
t
malty
clean
taste
but
limited
flavor
some
carbonation
i
was
expecting
almost
a
wine
taste
but
this
is
quite
tame
in
the
taste
department
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
great
discovering
the
lees
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
lends
credence
to
the
bottleconditioning
claim
however
this
is
still
just
a
barely
better
than
average
ale
the
flavours
never
really
rising
above
the
gimmick
of
the
sparkling
ale
arent
all
beers
sparkling
or
ya
know
carbonated
to
some
extent
do
a
pretty
unobtrusive
english
pale
ale
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
this
beer
but
there
are
better
epas
out
there
yes
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
but
after
two
id
get
tired
of
the
flavors
cheers
drinkability
distinctly
drinkable
it
might
be
a
hair
too
sweet
however
to
quaff
a
lot
of
em
id
definitely
have
this
again
though
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
d
this
wasnt
bad
but
it
was
kind
of
boring
and
not
very
clean
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
was
ultimately
unremarkable
and
forgettable
seemed
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
than
english
from
the
bottle
dated
10
jun
091426
sampled
on
may
20
2010
there
is
something
incedibly
refreshing
about
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
i
drank
it
cold
when
the
temperature
was
84
degrees
outside
the
pour
was
a
pale
yellow
but
also
quite
cloudy
with
a
long
lasting
good
sized
head
there
is
a
vague
sensation
of
malts
in
the
aroma
but
otherwise
it
tends
to
speak
to
me
in
fruity
tones
the
taste
has
a
biting
sharpness
to
it
but
speckled
with
citrus
and
muted
hopped
notes
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
deep
but
instead
the
ideal
balanced
summer
drinker
drinkability
would
be
even
higher
only
its
a
bit
too
lively
and
strong
notes
this
is
a
refreshing
and
tasty
beer
that
is
just
fun
to
drink
they
would
be
much
more
drinkable
however
if
they
were
not
five
bucks
a
pop
at
the
outback
steakhouse
i
could
easily
take
down
quite
a
few
of
these
if
i
had
more

the

poured
a
cloudy

with

a

retains
well
with

what

was

was

smells
lightly
of
citrus
and
some
malt
that
is
almost
like
a
malt
liquor
the
beer
has
a
nice
light
bitterness
with
a
clean
finish
at
times
noted
a
mild
sweetness
other
times
the
malty
backbone
is
most
evident
feels
good
in
the
mouth
with
average
carbonation
and
the
beer
coating
the
mouth
without
sticking
an
easy
drinking
beer
from
the
land
down
under
verdict
im
certainly
glad
i
tried
this
one
i
was
a
little
sceptical
of
it
but
in
the
end
it
impressed
me
its
definitely
a
recommendation
overall
an
ok
beer
that
barely
beats
out
a
bmc
in
aroma
and
taste
dont
recommend
rotation
avail
here
in
tx
but
one
is
enough
1xbot
i
prefer
this
greatly
to
their
pale
ale
which
tastes
of
nothing
to
me
this
one
has
more
bitters
not
necessarily
bitterness
and
maltiness
and
altogether
has
more
to
give
good
stuff
i
like
the
raw
flavour
of
this
beer
and
think
it
would
be
worth
tracking
down
for
overseas
beer
aficionados
at
least
for
a
try
it
has
a
bit
of
a
macho
quality
to
it
i
think
its
fairly
cloudy
but
light
and
the
taste
matches
i
remember
sampling
other
coopers
stout
and
liking
them
i
could
drink
more
of
this
i
look
forward
to
getting
to
australia
some
day
although
its
unlikely
the
brewers
from
down
under
who
put
this
up
are
doing
a
good
job
i
guess
i
can
visit
vicariously
through
them
d
not
really
a
session
beer
one
or
2
are
fine
and
it
gets
dull
a
good
beer
and
i
think
deserves
more
credit
than
what
it
gets
good
for
summer
no
real
alcohol
taste
or
smell
and
that
is
good
honestly
i
do
not
think
it
ships
well
to
the
usa
gets
flat
and
stale
sitting
around
coopers
should
focus
on
their
vintage
and
stout
to
the
usa
not
pale
and
sparkling
if
in
australia
i
seriously
suggest
it
good
for
2
beers
in
a
pub
poured
from
a
brown
12
7
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
hops
taste
like
it
smells
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
some
hints
of
fruit
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
final
thoughts
very
few
complaints
on
this
one
pale
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
certainly
is
a
good
ambassador
for
australia
certainly
a
lot
better
then
fosters
lager
thats
for
sure
if
my
brother
ends
up
reading
this
thumbs
up
hopefully
the
next
time
i
have
it
ill
manage
to
pour
it
right
if
you
find
this
down
under
buy
yourself
some
bring
home
solid
atmosphere
really
nice
appearance
great
full
nose
flavor
is
not
complex
but
has
a
really
solid
combination
of
tones
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
poured
from
a
12
7
ounce
short
stubby
bottle
with
best
after
date
on
the
label
lots
of
carbonated
bubbles
with
little
head
nice
golden
color
crisp
clean
flavor
a
presence
of
hops
balanced
with
notes
of
corn
and
wheat
fresh
almost
grassy
flavor
pretty
well
balanced
flavor
a
great
standby
ale
very
drinkable
cheers
body
is
mediumlight
and
palate
is
pretty
crisp
this
is
not
terrible
for
the
style
i
guess
but
overall
i
think
it
falls
on
the
crappier
side
of
average
its
been
about
a
year
since
ive
had
this
and
i
was
a
bit
unsure
what
to
make
of
it
at
that
time
lots
of
stuff
at
the
bottom
of
my
over
12
ouncer
a
touch
hazy
light
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
its
a
lightly
hopped
apa
combined
with
a
hefe
for
me
some
banana
and
clove
and
then
tart
citrus
the
citrus
and
yeast
are
pretty
dominant
it
took
me
a
couple
to
even
try
to
disseminate
the
tastes
not
bad
yeah
turns
out
two
or
so
years
later
i
still
dont
like
this
i
dont
think
ill
ever
come
back
to
it
for
any
reason
bottle
poured
a
bright
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
dry
cereal
with
light
lingering
sweetness
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
unrefined
malt
notes
and
light
sweetness
with
a
dry
finish
with
no
discernible
hops
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
at
the
end
of
the
day
with
a
substandard
malt
bill
drinkability
i
just
cannot
warm
up
to
the
flavors
in
this
beer
though
unusual
and
a
styledefier
i
would
prefer
a
more
traditional
english
pale
ale
hop
bill
to
balance
out
the
other
flavors
despite
the
name
im
fairly
impressed
with
this
brew
its
unique
enough
to
not
be
pencilled
in
as
an
epa
but
something
else
entirely
worth
a
try
probably
will
pick
up
a
few
more
myself
c
so
far
im
impressed
with
coopers
not
a
world
beater
a
nice
change
of
pace
brewery
d
a
very
quaffable
brew
that
is
quite
refreshing
i
could
enjoy
this
yearround
while
this
is
classified
as
an
english
pale
ale
here
i
am
hardpressed
to
judge
it
against
pale
ales
made
in
the
uk
as
this
classic
has
almost
established
itself
as
a
onebeerstyle
and
it
is
absolutley
delightful
expensive
18
99
cdn6
but
still
a
refreshing
pale
ale
to
me
this
is
one
of
those
genius
brews
whether
the
brewery
knows
people
receive
this
stuff
as
such
might
be
a
surprise
to
them
but
i
love
this
kind
of
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
simultaneously
elegant
i
could
give
this
to
my
father
and
he
wouldnt
be
like
tastes
like
vomit
and
i
could
give
this
to
a
beer
geek
friend
and
they
could
still
pick
it
apart
a
beer
for
all
seasons
id
say
and
one
i
hope
to
run
into
again
in
the
near
future
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
tons
of
small
sediment
specks
sunk
to
the
bottom
and
a
thin
white
head
up
top
smells
like
warm
sourdough
bread
fresh
out
of
the
oven
very
yeasty
sourdough
bread
on
the
palate
as
well
with
a
curious
green
apple
and
herbaceous
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
interesting
it
is
definitely
refreshing
im
not
saying
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
world
of
course
but
from
what
ive
tried
this
is
my
personal
favourite
id
also
recommend
little
creatures
pale
ale
and
of
course
coopers
pale
ale
to
people
looking
for
a
decent
australian
beer
overall
a
very
pleasant
enjoyable
brewwould
be
a
great
starter
beer
for
craft
beer
newbies
tasty
refreshing
and
crisp
this
is
an
easy
quaffer
with
great
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
fits
only
because
its
australian
and
im
at
an
australian
themed
restaurant
think
peroni
at
an
italian
place
ill
say
that
if
you
arent
expecting
much
and
you
appreciate
trying
to
match
your
beers
that
way
this
isnt
an
awful
beer
as
far
as
reviewing
it
as
an
english
pale
i
cant
recommend
it
i
think
i
might
have
waited
too
long
on
this
one
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
at
all
kind
of
a
refreshing
brew
and
makes
a
decent
impression
nothing
offensive
here
at
all
just
a
good
quaffer
amber
in
color
with
very
little
head
just
a
collar
at
the
end
not
a
lot
of
smell
for
me
i
had
tried
coopers
sparkling
ale
about
a
month
ago
and
didnt
care
for
it
so
im
drinking
one
now
with
the
intention
of
reviewing
it
guess
what
apparently
it
grew
on
me
and
i
like
it
it
has
a
carbonation
bite
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
the
sparkling
implies
it
reminds
me
of
a
lager
in
both
feel
and
drinkability
light
gold
color
with
tons
or
prickle
this
development
is
not
surprising
since
it
is
named
sparkling
ale
mildly
fruity
nose
and
smoe
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
plenty
of
grain
and
hops
presence
in
the
flavor
and
in
the
mouthfeel
some
sharpness
to
the
flavor
and
a
lingering
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
i
just
cant
place
and
is
a
little
bit
off
i
cant
identify
right
now
there
is
an
alcohol
like
burn
to
the
finish
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
it
is
is
unique
or
at
least
uncommon
for
me
if
that
hidden
flavor
wasnt
nagging
at
me
so
much
andor
was
absent
from
the
beer
i
would
say
it
was
a
very
good
light
beer
the
strange
flavor
really
is
dragging
it
down
for
me
i
would
drink
it
again
however
and
would
like
to
share
it
with
some
friends
d
high
very
high
overall
it
does
suffer
from
the
hop
usage
but
it
tastes
very
natural
with
an
organic
bitterness
and
a
distinct
lack
of
adjunct
sweetness
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
if
not
delectable
drinkability
this
beer
is
quite
exceptional
that
being
said
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
even
with
a
questionable
date
it
has
been
kept
fresher
from
the
cold
storage
at
the
store
and
the
nature
of
bottle
conditioning
it
was
a
treat
and
really
hit
the
spot
although
its
not
a
typical
bottle
conditioned
english
pale
ale
it
is
a
refreshing
change
for
those
fans
of
the
style
quite
wellbalanced
and
very
easily
drinkable
with
each
sip
calling
for
the
next
the
bottle
conditioning
adds
just
enough
carbonation
and
a
nice
overall
character
to
the
beer
only
helping
this
otherwise
simple
sessionesque
ale
remain
interesting
m
the
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
the
best
element
of
this
beer
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
very
assertive
and
crisp
feeling
it
makes
it
incredibly
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
and
the
somewhat
mellow
flavours
help
keep
it
that
way
the
taste
is
light
but
characterful
and
complex
with
plenty
of
grain
citrus
hints
of
bubblegum
and
fruit
apple
and
pear
the
latter
being
stronger
in
the
finish
which
is
mostly
strong
toasted
grain
with
some
pine
there
is
a
noticeable
hints
of
alcohol
light
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
with
light
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
leafyspicey
bite
the
body
is
light
crisp
and
somewhat
fizzy
yet
full
good
body
and
the
high
carbonation
works
well
with
the
sharp
bitterness
to
create
a
refreshing
dry
finish
this
is
my
every
day
beer
of
choice
keeping
in
mind
it
is
relatively
well
priced
and
easy
to
find
where
i
am
notes
focused
and
crisp
highly
sessionable
beer
not
a
bad
brew
but
doesnt
advertise
itself
well
it
had
a
fairly
dull
look
and
smell
wish
i
knew
about
the
bottle
conditioning
beforehand
so
i
wouldnt
be
eating
hop
junk
but
oh
well
definitely
a
nice
mix
up
to
my
usual
lineup
375ml
bottle
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
large
sticky
white
head
some
sediment
grainy
slightly
floral
aromas
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
somewhat
faint
all
around
taste
is
a
bit
of
lemon
with
sweet
malts
and
a
drier
hoppy
finish
good
carbonation
with
a
lightmedium
body
bunch
of
carbonation
in
this
one
keeps
with
the
crisp
tone
of
flavor
and
the
overall
drinkability
this
will
be
great
summer
grilling
beer
i
got
the
6
instead
of
the
single
and
need
another
round
tonight
to
see
how
i
like
it
so
far
first
impressions
make
this
worth
trying
and
buying
again
if
you
are
into
deep
flavored
sweetsided
fruity
ales
dont
go
here
medium
to
thick
bodied
with
a
moderate
soft
carbonation
easy
drinking
one
of
the
best
session
beers
around
all
the
attributes
of
a
great
beer
cloudy
solid
orangecopper
with
a
tight
head
not
an
overly
generous
nose
but
enough
there
hopwise
to
keep
it
interesting
a
bit
of
lemon
and
yeastiness
smooth
and
unobtrusive
not
a
showstopper
but
just
a
great
beer
for
any
situation
even
better
on
tap
of
course
drinkability
after
the
deficient
appearance
i
really
took
my
time
with
this
brew
to
see
if
it
could
redeem
itself
it
never
did
sour
and
a
bit
watery
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
d
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
not
anything
i
would
get
regularly
there
is
almost
a
little
spice
in
the
finish
and
i
am
not
sure
if
its
a
good
thing
pours
a
cloudy
orangish
colored
body
with
some
nonmoving
bubbles
frozen
in
place
it
seems
has
some
head
diminshing
has
a
very
malty
aroma
not
hoppy
or
very
aleish
malty
lagerish
clean
taste
not
very
much
taste
plain
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
much
of
a
beer
lovers
delight
overly
carbonated
not
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
soapy
head
musky
scent
but
nothing
as
horrifying
as
heineken
tastes
decent
cannot
describe
the
flavors
just
quite
ordinary
not
bad
but
not
something
i
will
reach
for
in
the
future
beer
pours
well
with
small
head
smells
good
good
end
of
week
beer
first
beer
goes
down
well
but
subsequent
beers
go
down
smooth
great
start
to
a
good
night
my
favorite
beer
at
outback
steakhouse
good
compliment
to
steak
sediment
at
bottom
of
bottle
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
orange
highlights
fair
amount
of
sediment
in
bottle
develops
a
thin
white
head
with
no
retention
into
a
light
collar
smell
is
of
belgium
sugars
and
malt
taste
has
a
slight
metallic
hint
and
is
watery
a
sour
skunky
aftertaste
is
present
thin
and
simple
texture
not
much
flavor
to
this
beer
so
would
pass
on
the
oppurtunity
to
try
again
d
very
drinkable
this
was
an
unexpected
surprise
i
really
enjoyed
the
yeast
character
of
this
ale
and
the
crispness
made
it
a
perfect
palate
cleanser
bronze
pour
with
a
small
white

dirt
straw
and
malt
make
up
the
nose
not
a
good
start
to
say
the
least
taste
is
sharp
and
tangy
with
some
earthiness
that
seems
to
be
the
hallmark
of
every
coopers
beer
golding
hops
give
it
a
bite
overall
a
decent
beer
recommended
to
all
if
you
enjoy
beers
with
citrus
overtones
d
okay
but
nothing
special
seems
to
be
a
mix
of
styles
too
bitter
for
a
hefe
yet
too
cloudy
and
estery
to
be
a
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
it
seemed
more
american
than
english
but
it
was
still
good
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
with
a
lot
of
visible
floaties
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
nuts
with
a
nice
floral
hops
presence
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hop
caramel
toffee
nuts
and
a
lengthy
floral
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
texture
from
the
suspended
yeast
and
nice
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
english
pale
ale
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
d
this
beer
didnt
bring
to
much
to
the
table
for
me
it
very
much
resembled
a
miller
lite
in
taste
but
with
more
character
the
abv
and
carbonation
are
both
to
high
to
session
this
it
was
neat
to
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
again
the
mouthfeel
is
really
poor
its
sort
of
watery
theres
very
little
body
i
guess
its
somewhat
drinkable
because
its
watery
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
if
it
was
the
only
thing
available
its
not
sour
it
beats
a
lot
of
american
macros
by
a
tad
but
id
probably
switch
over
at
some
point
if
somehow
that
was
the
night
one
of
several
import
beers
from
the
carrefour
supermarket
in
chiang
mai
thailand
that
kept
me
from
bitching
daily
about
crap
thai
beer
this
review
was
with
a
bottle
whose
cap
lost
pressure
on
the
airplane
trip
back
to
the
states
beer
abuse
yes
but
other
than
a
loss
of
carbonation
it
still
tastes
as
good
as
it
did
back
in
thailand
wow
wow
wee
wow
wow
i
loved
this
beer
from
down
unda
makes
sense
i
suppose
every
aussie
ive
met
brags
of
their
drinking
ability
their
brewers
ought
to
know
what
theyre
doing
alright
back
to
the
beer
not
only
is
it
kosher
even
has
hebrew
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
but
i
found
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
some
may
knock
a
brewery
for
allowing
a
little
sediment
to
creep
into
their
production
line
to
me
i
see
that
as
a
little
extra
flavor
and
that
small
batch
touch
all
of
my
home
brew
has
a
little
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
i
know
that
packs
a
flavorful
punch
as
did
this
beer
i
give
this
beer
an
a
all
the
way
enjoy
it
with
a
light
meal
or
simply
by
itself
very
carbonated
and
dry
i
could
see
this
being
something
i
might
want
to
drink
a
couple
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
there
really
isnt
much
flavor
going
on
at
all
and
id
probably
buy
something
else
instead
d
it
certainly
wouldnt
be
difficult
to
put
this
back
all
night
because
it
is
damn
close
to
drinking
club
soda
while
this
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
or
have
any
off
flavors
its
complete
lack
of
character
keeps
it
below
average
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
lot
of
what
i
assume
to
be
yeast
floating
around
in
it
and
very
little
head
the
smell
is
pretty
tight
with
perhaps
just
a
bit
of
bit
of
malts
the
starts
off
with
some
malts
and
almost
applelike
sugars
that
are
quickly
cut
by
some
citrusy
hops
that
give
way
to
a
fairly
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
crisp
thanks
to
its
medium
body
and
carbonation
id
consider
this
beer
to
be
fairly
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
a
try
d
average
drinkability
not
one
i
would
enjoy
in
multiples
but
worthy
of
a
try
drinkability
es
okay
the
taste
is
quite
good
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
lots
of
character
there
is
a
puckerishness
in
the
finish
and
lots
of
citrusy
hops
and
bready
malts
in
the
mid
section
you
can
definitely
taste
the
abv
which
is
surprising
with
a
5
8
abv
beer
as
things
settle
down
a
bit
there
is
a
sweetish
slightly
acerbic
lemony
flavor
that
comes
out
with
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
there
is
also
a
drying
hop
taste
that
youll
experience
as
well
this
is
a
surprisingly
robust
ale
well
worth
trying
d
a
surprise
this
was
a
very
credible
worthy
drinker
pours
a
hazed
gold
no
head
off
a
gentle
pour
nose
is
grainy
and
earthy
almost
dirty
flavor
is
fruity
and
smooth
biting
bitter
tone
feel
has
a
biting
carbonation
liquid
is
typical
this
is
an
okay
at
best
beer
theres
nothing
that
stands
out
about
it
best
served
damn
cold
d
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lightweight
ale
in
short
the
cost
and
hype
definately
did
not
fit
this
beer
there
wasnt
enough
to
back
up
the
rave
reviews
from
michael
jackson
the
beer
geek
not
pop
singer
robert
protz
or
ba
i
just
did
not
understand
why
this
average
beer
is
so
well
liked
i
will
not
buy
it
again
md
sparkling
well
the
texture
is
in
fact
spritzy
but
with
very
fine
light
and
refreshing
fizziness
mediumbodied
as
it
is
this
ale
has
retained
a
rough
balance
bw
yeasts
and
malts
while
hops
sortof
retreat
to
the
second
tier
to
provide
a
key
bitter
element
overall
this
ale
is
best
enjoyed
when
served
cloudy
imo
and
what
a
thirstquenching
ale
this
could
be
tastes
like
a
heavy
lager
with
some
citrus
alcoholic
notes
and
nice
and
bitter
finish
was
looking
for
sierra
nevada
at
outback
steak
house
they
didnt
have
it
tried
a
nut
brown
ale
newcastle
tried
before
not
my
kind
of
beer
saw
coopers
sparkling
ale
and
thought
what
the
heck
never
tried
a
autralian
ale
made
a
good
decision
i
like
the
extra
carbonation
on
my
tongue
d
its
great
that
coopers
is
keeping
the
sparkling
ale
style
alive
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
session
beer
bmc
buddies
wont
mind
it
either
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
blonde
ale
or
as
coopers
calls
it
a
sparkling
ale
semantics
aside
it
can
sparkle
in
my
glass
any
day
honey
colored
golden
amber
with
a
strong
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
cap
the
aroma
is
of
breadyeast
and
some
apple
the
opaque
body
is
moderate
in
viscosity
with
a
sharp
cider
twinge
there
is
a
cleansing
amount
of
carbonation
that
finishes
dry
and
slightly
hoped
cooper
sparkling
ale
is
refreshing
and
enjoyable
try
with
a
red
pepper
hummus
or
a
mild

the
aromas
are
sweet
with
bready

and
some

but
it
is
by
no

heavy
the
taste
is
similar
with
nicely

fruit
and
bready

with
a
fruity
and
crisp
bitterness
on
the
finish
smooth
and
easy

no

the
nose
is

is

bananafaint
bready

with

the

thought
i
would
actually
feel
the
yeastit
looked
so
plentiful
on
the
pour
pretty
drinkable
stuff
overalli
could
see
how
it
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
humid
day
in
the
outbackbuti
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
for
a
while
d
i
would
defiantly
get
this
again
i
tried
it
when
i
was
out
to
dinner
at
the
outback
but
i
will
pick
it
up
next
time
at
my
local
bevmo
this
one
appears
to
have
a
hazy
gold
color
with
no
head
on
it
the
first
whiff
gave
me
some
fruity
undertones
with
a
decent
floral
hop
presence
taste
was
a
little
more
on
the
hop
side
than
i
was
expecting
with
some
malt
coming
through
to
kinda
even
it
out
mouthfeel
was
good
balance
and
kinda
crisp
on
the
lighter
side
d
i
would
say
its
good
but
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
it
seems
as
far
as
going
for
the
sparkling
aspect
it
is
very
good
i
would
prefer
a
standard
pale
ale
over
this
usually
d
very
drinkable
but
i
cant
afford
it
because
outback
is
the
only
place
i
can
pick
it
up
no
local
retailers
of
this
brew
very
good
though
lively
crisp
feel
despite
the
name
the
carbonation
could
be
more
aggressive
but
still
pretty
strong
not
bad
at
all
for
an
english
pale
ale
excellent
aussie
brew
now
this
is
what
one
should
be
drinking
if
one
wants
to
truly
experience
australian
beer
fosters
here
isnt
even
made
there
this
ale
is
sparkling
indeed
smooth
yet
effervescent
mouthfeel
yeasty
and
citrusylike
hops
followed
off
by
just
an
eversobitter
tinge
at
the
end
quite
quaffable
not
a
bad
abv
either
i
can
get
a
24

of
this

surprisingly
i
tried
this
one
at

i
was
a
little
wary
after
trying
the

bombs
james

premium
lager
and
tooheys
new

i
was
pleasently
surprised
poured
a
fine
bubbley
gold
reminiscent
of
champagne
smelled
of
nice
sweet
fruity
malts
tasted
a
hint
of
apple
and
other
fruits
very
quaffable
a
classic
brew
that
im
glad
to
have
a
chance
to
have
thanks
again
john
d
sessionable
this
one
has
everything
you
need
with
nothing
over
the
top
interesting
recommended
oelergud
overall
this
is
not
my
sort
of
beer
its
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
its
just
not
that
great
either
my
favorite
of
the
two
coopers
the
other
being
the
pale
ale
pours
a
very
hazy
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
lasts
for
perhaps
half
the
drink
holding
this
up
to
the
light
reveals
a
lot
of
yeast
in
suspension
more
than
ive
ever
seen
before
in
fact
a
thick
layer
of
yeast
settles
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
about
2
mm
thick
strong
malty
aroma
with
some
apple
lurking
at
the
edge
the
taste
is
fairly
light
with
the
fruit
and
malt
characters
coming
through
again
but
all
in
all
its
a
little
nondescript
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
very
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
its
a
sparkling
ale
so
thats
a
good
thing
in
my
book
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
maybe
too
gassy
to
drink
quickly
or
session
although
id
almost
certainly
go
for
something
else
first
i
did
have
one
more
before
the
night
was
over
as
it
was
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
ale
and
will
likely
purchase
this
and
only
this
the
next
time
my
wife
drags
me
to
outback
steakhouse
by
the
way
the
first
one
the
bartender
opened
was
rolled
a
bit
roughly
as
she
tried
to
distribute
the
sediment
around
and
she
ended
up
giving
me
a
second
one
for
free
as
an
aology
best
mistake
ever
oh
and
why
call
it
sparkling
if
the
yeast
will
make
it
cloudy
despite
my
best
efforts
to
decant
lol
pours
a
cloudy
peach
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
smells
hoppy
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
taste
strikes
me
as
quite
light
and
crisp
yet
with
substance
overall
a
sense
of
fruit
and
hops
some
vague
citrus
in
the
background
with
a
mild
hoppy
finish
not
very
bitter
mouthfeel
nice
and
substantial
yet
bubbly
quite
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
rugged
ale
very
rustic
yet
very
drinkable
pours
a
golden
blond
color
with
sediment
from
bottle
conditioning
and
a
thick
onefinger
head
aroma
is
breadybiscuity
and
only
mildly
fruity
taste
is
fruity
upfront
with
a
nice
breadiness
in
the
aftertaste
i
think
i
can
detect
esters
which
also
give
it
a
bit
of
a
banana
flavor
smooth
inoffensive
seems
to
go
down
ok
nothing
impressive
though
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
regularly
but
might
want
to
pull
it
out
once
a
year
or
so
just
for
the
novelty
value
ive
never
thought
of
sparkling
as
a
good
item
in
a
beers
name
or
description
pours
a
cloudy
golden
colour
with
a
finger
width
head
that
sits
around
for
a
while
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
though
it
does
disappear
has
a
malty
aroma
mixed
with
a
fruity
smell
the
flavour
is
rich
and
smooth
and
rather
citrusy
quite
low
on
the
fizz
too
no
bitter
aftertaste
which
allows
it
to
go
down
well
very
drinkable
a
beautiful
golden
somewhat
cloudy
semitransparent
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
aroma
is
strong
and
pleasantly
malty
not
complex
but
appealing
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
an
undertone
of
citrus
and
hints
of
hops
almost
no
bitterness
a
very
smooth
and
refreshing
ale
the
particulate
is
sticking
to
my
throat
it
may
be
psychosomatic
but
it
is
unexpectedly
unpleasant
guess
im
babied
by
filtration
ill
try
not
to
hold
a
grudge
since
coopers
is
all
about
sediment
review
added

translated
from
french
2262008
ive
had
this
before
and
i
remembered
it
as
being
something
a
bit
more
than
what
im
now
tasting
its
bottle
conditioned
so
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
flavour
this
comes
across
pretty
ordinary
its
good
but
nothing
special
nothing
unsatisfactory
though
just
straight
down
the
middle
poured
a
cloudy
pale
orangegolden
color
with
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
aroma
was
not
real
strong
but
smelled
faintly
of
hops
flavor
was
malty
and
simple
not
a
complex
beer
and
not
offensive
mouthfeel
was
good
okay
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
as
you
can
see
i
thought
this
was
a
golden
ale
overall
not
a
bad
beer
while
it
grew
on
me
the
more
i
drank
and
as
it
warmed
there
wasnt
enough
to
make
me
seek
it
out
tried
this
a
couple
of
nights
ago
at
a
restaurant
and
got
to
pour
it
out
myself
i
decided
to
go
the
whole
way
and
poured
the
entire
beer
slowly
into
the
glass
so
i
could
keep
the
sediments
extra
flavor
came
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
all
right
smell
not
overpowering
but
no
distinct
aromas
either
has
a
nice
taste
nice
hops
and
malt
balance
good
tingle
it
has
a
nice
bottle
conditioned
additional
bitterness
goes
down
great
and
was
excellent
with
lobster
had
it
again
on
april
808
better
with
the
sediment
in
d
drinkable
in
the
16
range
this
sparkling
ale
is
decent
to
style
and
not
awful
its
just
not
fantastic
either
would
likely
be
good
as
one
in
a
crowd
for
a
session
d
nothing
special
but
its
a
tasty
fall
back
beer
as
its
available
at
pretty
much
every
bottle
shop
at
a
reasonable
price
this
is
definitely
a
better
than
average
beer
and
has
more
personality
than
coopers
pale
ale
like
all
coopers
beers
i
believe
this
is
good
value
as
it
is
far
tastier
than
the
mainstream
options
however
the
bitter
residue
and
tart
flavours
mean
drinkability
is
average
at
best
interesting
poured
an
cloudy
light
amber
lots
of
sediment
floating
about
the
fizzy
bubbles
not
much
retention
on
the
thin
head
smells
of
all
sorts
of
ale
characteristics
bready
malts
fruity
yeast
earthy
hops
very
nice
taste
is
very
unique
a
bit
sour
like
a
green
apple
but
also
earthybready
too
fizzy
but
i
guess
it
is
the
sparkling
ale
but
its
very
sessionable
for
the
5
8
a
nice
creation
nothing
id
actively
seek
out
but
id
buy
another
sixer
of
this
from
the
bottle
it
poured
a
dirty
gold
color
with
about
a
1
head
looked
highly
carbonated
with
a
fair
amount
of
bubbling
almost
like
a
soda
there
were
also
some
sedimentfloaties
but
that
is
supposed
to
be
normal
for
this
brew
smelled
kind
of
fruity
and
sweet
the
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
and
a
little
sweet
high
in
yeast
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
and
leaves
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
its
not
very
sparkling
as
this
brew
pours
a
very
cloudy
old
gold
with
a
lot
of
sediment
if
you
choose
to
decant
with
the
sediment
a
slight
head
forms
but
quickly
disappears
aroma
is
apples
pears
and
prunes
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
pears
and
plums
shine
through
not
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
in
the
taste
of
the
finish
a
solid
brew
very
drinkable
but
not
very
inspiring
d
very
refreshing
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
exactly
an
english
pale
ale
but
a
good
tasty
ale
to
drink
would
be
a
good
palate
cleanser
pours
a
muddy
golden
color
with
plenty
of
floaters
as
i
decided
to
swirl
the
bottle
before
i
poured
the
last
2
ozs
the
head
is
white
and
kind
of
flat
no
lacing
detected
the
smell
is
very
faint
a
pick
up
a
hint
of
granny
apple
the
taste
is
a
little
grainy
a
slight
grassy
hop
taste
in
the
backend
to
add
some
bitterness
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
perhaps
a
bit
too
carbonated
as
it
seems
to
kills
some
of
the
taste
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
for
whatever
reason
i
like
it
more
than
my
review
would
tell
not
sure
about
the
epa
classification
but
whatever
when
at
outback
this
is
the
beer
to
get
drinkability
easy
street
never
tried
it
so
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
6
packs
from
the
local
beer
store
i
didnt
realize
it
had
all
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
which
kinda
put
me
off
it
at
first
well
ive
tried
other
beers
with
a
little
sediment
and
they
were
great
this
one
well
not
so
much
poured
into
a
glass
with
decent
head
and
an
orange
amber
color
on
looking
closer
you
can
see
all
the
gritty
mudcolored
sediment
the
smell
isnt
that
great
and
neither
is
the
taste
it
had
a
malty
metallic
slightly
musty
taste
which
i
didnt
find
appealling
at
all
needless
to
say
after
a
drain
pour
this
one
will
never
be
bought
again
da
this
seems
like
really
good
quality
stuff
coming
all
the
way
from
australia
it
came
along
way
and
is
rather
unique
i
actually
had
no
problem
finishing
off
a
6pack
with
my
girlfriend
mouthfeel
is
midwieght
spritzy
fuzzy
eric
the
sticky
sweetness
lingers
in
the
finish
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
anymore
of
these
sweettart
bombs
this
beer
starts
off
in
a
hole
based
on
the
appearance
scent
and
taste
improve
things
but
not
hugely
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
drinkability
considering
its
not
to
styly
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
pleasant
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
day
i
probably
could
session
this
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
overall
its
pretty
good
definitely
worth
a
shot
great
head
on
top
of
a
speckled
gold
body
lots
of
floaters
throughout
aromas
of
citrus
and
yeast
not
bad
flavor
just
not
impressive
i
can
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
i
tried
with
and
without
the
sediment
mixed
and
i
preferred
mixed
but
still
not
impressed
d
a
bit
sweet
and
overly
carbonated
but
it
fits
the
name
a
light
bitterness
and
feel
makes
it
easy
to
drink
several
it
has
a
slightly
lingering
sour
flavor
but
overall
may
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
this
is
just
a
really
plain
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
refreshing
theres
no
real
malt
to
it
but
some
sweetness
and
fruit
its
a
bit
like
apple
but
bland
the
guy
at
the
party
source
apparently
really
likes
this
beer
i
found
it
to
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
save
this
for
a
hot
day
in
australia
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
in
a
good
way
this
is
my
first
sparkling
ale
and
it
will
not
be
my
last
this
beer
is
bottle
fermented
and
has
a
mild
yeast
flavor
that
i
really
enjoy
this
style
has
a
very
interesting
mouth
feel
similar
to
champagne
the
carbonation
doesnt
last
quite
as
long
and
there
isnt
any
dryness
very
good
beer
that
everyone
should
try
at
some
point
it
pours
like
a
golden
pale
ale
with
the
addition
of
sediment
floating
in
the
body
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
of
the
sediment
at
first
but
the
back
of
the
bottle
said
not
to
worry
as
its
totally
natural
the
smells
a
little
fruity
and
the
taste
is
extrememly
well
balanced
with
a
yeasty
apricot
tang
to
it
a
very
interesting
beer
sort
of
like
a
belgian
extremely
light
pale
ale
medium
body
with
slow
developing
flavors
a
clean
sterile
tasting
start
fades
into
what
seems
somewhat
like
sour
cherries
possibly
a
result
of
yeast
sediment
making
it
into
the
glass
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
although
i
would
buy
again
this
will
not
be
a
regular
buy
for
me
pours
a
very
cloudy
hazy
yellow
color
with
tons
of
sediment
has
a
slight
head
that
disappears
quickly
not
much
of
smell
just
of
malt
yeast
and
water
tastes
just
the
same
but
unfortunately
the
water
is
the
most
prevalent
taste
this
is
my
first
bottle
fermented
beer
and
im
not
a
big
fan
its
refreshing
and
one
of
the
better
south
australian
brews
which
competes
with
australias
best
offerings
reminds
me
of
a
hopped
up
english
style
bitter
or
pale
ale
with
a
unique
carbonation
different
there
is
something
i
like
about
this
beer
the
5
8
is
very
well
hidden
this
could
be
an
alternative
to
common
quality
session
beers
very
unappetizing
beer
with
a
flavour
similar
to
your
average
macro
pours
out
carefully
a
chillhazed
golden
color
with
a
thin
head
that
fizzles
into
absolutely
nothing
smells
awfully
watery
with
a
faint
scent
of
nutty
malt
if
the
smell
of
malt
was
faint
the
smell
of
hops
is
nearly
nonexistent
flavor
is
watery
with
some
pale
malts
in
there
somewhere
and
a
kick
of
yeast
and
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
too
bubbly
im
not
into
this
pours
a
cloudy
whitishyellow
with
the
tiniest
of
pure
white
heads
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
scanty
lacing
hugely
effervescent
one
can
see
the
giant
bubbles
surfacing
and
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
yeasty
with
some
lemon
and
breadiness
at
the
forefront
some
apple
and
pear
hanging
back
and
a
faintly
grassy
tone
in
the
mix
as
well
taste
is
full
of
grains
and
breads
with
a
mild
citrus
note
from
the
hops
and
a
definite
alcohol
note
as
well
apple
and
orange
and
both
apparent
and
the
yeast
makes
itself
known
in
the
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
well
carbonated
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
and
drinkability
is
good
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
from
australia
was
a
surprising
find
but
its
a
reasonably
worthwhile
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beers
from
coopers
regardless
of
the
style
seem
to
have
alot
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
beer
creating
a
very
hazy
appearance
poured
a
deep
yellow
with
a
14
inch
head
that
faded
to
a
slight
head
but
resulting
in
some
decent
lacing
alot
of
sediment
floating
around
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
citrusy
the
flavor
is
slightly
citrus
not
as
much
as
a
pale
ale
normally
tastes
but
more
like
a
cross
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
lager
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
care
to
have
more
of
coopers
stout
seems
to
be
there
best
offering
so
far
this
beer
has
a
dcent
appearance
and
a
faint
pheol
smell
it
is
light
yet
crisp
and
very
refreshing
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
it
is
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
it
i
did
not
realize
it
was
a
5
8
alcohol
beer
i
will
try
more
offerings
from
ths
brewery
final
statement
much
better
than
fosters
its
redeems
aussie
beers
in
my
mind
very
refreshing
very
quaffable
decently
priced
here
so
i
will
likely
continue
to
buy
next
time
anyone
one
here
who
likes
belgian
style
ales
is
in
an
outback
please
order
this
so
that
they
keep
carrying
it
its
a
good
beer
and
really
stood
out
on
a
list
that
otherwise
has
newcastle
as
its
most
interesting
member
d
this
is
an
interesting
amber
ale
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
pours
like
an
alesmith
and
tastes
like
an
amber
ale
not
the
best
but
enjoyable
i
have
3
more
of
these
in
my
garage
i
think
my
son
is
getting
them
for
christmas
he
drinks
anything
as
long
as
it
is
crap
very
drinkable
was
slightlty
better
when
i
had
it
downunder
but
still
pretty
tasty
quaffable
epsecially
for
the
abv
reminds
me
a
lot
of
worthington
whiteshield
from
back
in
the
day
8893
uk
pour
this
very
carefully
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
australia
finally
managed
to
pour
this
one
and
forego
most
of
the
yeast
so
i
figured
id
review
this
one
again
i
will
say
this
came
from
the
same
six
pack
murky
yellow
body
with
almost
no
head
to
it
smells
kind
of
malty
with
some
skunk
maybe
but
i
wont
jump
to
conclusions
somewhat
sweet
with
citrus
hints
but
skunky
better
than
it
was
with
the
yeast
but
would
be
even
better
if
the
skunk
quality
wasnt
there
its
a
shame
since
i
couldnt
buy
this
by
the
bottle
and
the
stout
these
guys
make
is
exquisite
i
hate
to
give
such
a
mediocre
rating
but
this
was
the
beer
i
had
in
front
of
me
im
affraid
wasnt
really
all
that
sparkling
it
had
a
dull
pale
copper
straw
color
it
wasnt
all
that
clear
or
clean
looking
and
it
didnt
have
the
efforvescent
quality
that
sparkling
suggest
its
decent
beer
anyhow
murky
copper
amber
because
of
bottle
conditioning
english
malts
become
quite
sweet
and
heavy
earthy
hops
give
a
musty
grassy
flavor
and
bittering
fruity
ripe
and
overripe
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
flavors
and
malts
overpower
the
hops
for
a
sweet
balance
and
a
lessthanclean
finish
same
rating
as
the
bottle
some
subtle
differences
pours
a
effervescent
cloudy
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
aside
from
the
head
being
smaller
looks
almost
like
your
average
weissbier
the
thin
head
laces
well
though
smell
was
a
bit
of
phenollic
smoke
and
some
flowery
citrus
crikey
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
tangy
saison
with
a
fruity
start
tanging
up
on
the
tongue
and
finished
with
a
shrimp
on
the
bar
i
mean
grapefruity
hoppy
finish
this
is
nicely
naturally
carbonated
but
not
aggressively
so
this
is
a
refresher
and
the
highish
abv
is
well
hidden
plesantly
surprised

today
pours
hazy

lots
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
a
bit

a
sweet
malty
smell
tastes
like
a
summer
ale
not
too
complex
but
good
mouthfeel
is
fuzzy
a
bit
thin
overall
just
average
glad
i
actually
found
this
and
hopefully
it
will
be
sold
for
a
while
its
better
than
a
macro
but
nothing
to
wet
your
panties
over
it
has
already
been
through
at
least
one
goat
d
too
dry
for
me
and
not
close
enough
to
style
the
bottle
conditioning
throws
a
big
wrench
in
there
as
the
yeast
hides
the
sparkiling
qualities
it
is
also
lighter
than
your
typical
english
pale
it
was
ok
and
was
an
interesting
change

in

category
smell
of
lemon
and
a
grassyness
that
is
somewhat
musty
taste
is
very
underwhelming
again
i
get
a
musty
wet
grass
taste
some
very
light
maltyness
but
really
very
thin
in
taste
and
body
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
but
not
that
nice
hops
bitterness
that
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
its
more
of

me
want

quite
a
nice
looking
beer
at

honestly
if
you
didnt
have
to
look
at
it
and
you
couldnt

it
this
wouldnt
be
bad
at

good
one
to

perhaps
good
beer
for

while
barbecueing
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
unairconditioned
in
my
apartment
and
this
stuff
is
incredibly
thirst
quenching
on
a
warm
day
a
very
sessionable
beer
the
only
drawback
is
that
its
9
bucks
for
a
six
pack
here
in
town
i
just
may
go

expected
a
weak

type
beer
i
was
very
surprised
and
pleased
it
has
a
slightly
fruity
aroma
and
just
the
right
amount
of
fruit
flavor
to
be
very
tasty
yet
not
sweet
i
liked
the
goldenred
appearance
and
the
floaters
made
it
more
authentic
very
good

i
do
see
some
positives
here
i
like

oh

i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
so
good
im
pleasantly
surprised
this

this

still
harmonic

notes
not
for
me
fellas
i
really
enjoyed
the
stout
from
this
brewery
and
the
vintage
was
ok
but
this
is
giveaway
material
haaazy
and
thick
with
yeasties
floatin
around
golden
honey
colored
super
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
for
ages
and
leaves
pretty
lacing
nose
is
very
reminiscent
of
champagne
lightly
fruity
tangy
smelling
flavor
doesnt
run
as
deep
as
id
like
it
to
but
more
champagne
characteristics
bready
dry
champagne
not
much
in
the
way
of
sweetness
or
fruityness
if
you
like
dry
bubbley
this
is
for
you
mouthfeel
is
sooo
creamy
and
smooth
a
bit
oily
and
wet
definitely
wet
a
really
lovely
feel
drinkable
to
be
sure
not
overwhelming
on
the
palate
at
all
but
not
boring
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
solid
concoction
now
that
i
think
on
it
this
is
what
fosters
might
taste
like
if
it
was
actually
tasty
some
similar
notes
here
and
there
but
those
notes
are
well
played
in
this
brew
pale
ale
fans
should
pay
attention
taste
is
okay
sort
of
like
white
bread
with
lemon
hints
not
what
i
usually
expect
from
an
english
pale
ale
okay
mouthfeel
but
i
find
this
not
too
drinkable
something
about
it
just
puts
me
off
possibly
a
combination
of
the
unique
taste
and
the
high
carbonation
d
disappointing
better
than
most
macros
but
certainly
not
something
i
would
buy
again
this
would
be
a
superb
lawnmower
beer
its
refreshing
and
has
an
original
flavor
that
while
subdued
and
delicate
is
certainly
there
to
be
enjoyed
ill
remember
this
come
summertime
a
clean
and
fruity
beer
with
a
nice
zip
at
the
end
with
some
really
well
balanced
hops
a
great
aussie
beer
one
of
the
best
hazy
apricot
colour
with
a
thin
wisp
of
white
head
musty
peach
aroma
slightly
vegetal
but
fairly
mild
light
sweetness
backed
by
some
herbal
hoppiness
lightish
body
moderate
carbonation
seemed
quite
average
nothing
really
wrong
but
nothing
really
great
well
i
am
impressed
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
brew
but
i
am
surely
glad
i
tried
it
out
a
for
sure
reccomendation
golden
cloudy
yellow
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
no
lacing
and
plenty
of
sediment
aroma
is
of
faint
malts
lemon
and
hops
taste
is
clean
with
smooth
malts
and
the
hops
provide
some
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
at
the
end
each
swallow
mouthfeel
is
sparking
clean
simply
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
but
far
from
amazing
poured
out
to
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
14
inch
head
and
some
notes
of
lacing
in
the
glass
medium
high
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
malt
hops
and
barley
kind
of
weak
but
what
could
be
detected
revealed
a
nice
smell
taste
was
quite
good
yet
not
as
strong
as
i
had
anticipated
flavors
of
malt
hops
sugar
cane
and
citrus
were
light
and
airey
but
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
zesty
and
crisp
this
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
higher
level
of
drinkability
than
one
would
expect
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
with
ease
and
enjoyment
a
nice
beer
recommended
the
sparkeling
ale
is
a
feels
a
little
bit
sticky
but
is
very
drinkable
the
stickyness
does
not
linger
and
is
replaced
with
a
refreshed
quenching
impression
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
gold
nice
carbonation
with
a
small
head
lots
of
lacing
afterwards
could
smell
some
hops
malt
and
some
sweetness
very
nice
tasting
beer
with
a
medium
body
this
brew
would
make
a
very
nice
session
drink
would
recommend
overall
australian
made

australian
owned
so
says
the
label
i
really
hope
it
stays
that
way
despite
recent
rumors
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
dont
let
the
sparkling
moniker
put
you
off
this
is
a
bottleconditioned
brew
the
perfect
brew
to
help
me
start
a
very
late
night
and
early
morning
listening
to
the
1st
day
of
the
5th
and
final
test
from
the
oval
on
the
bbc
world
service
raising
this
brew
to
richie
benaud
oh
and
go
poms
hazy
light
gold
with
lots
of
dark
chunky
yeast
sediment
decent
head
i
actually
expected
more
considering
all
the
yeast
smell
suggests
a
light
and
sharp
hoppiness
malt
flavor
is
semisweet
with
a
nice
apple
cider
fruitiness
to
it
the
hops
come
in
herbal
and
mildly
bitter
in
the
english
style
with
a
lasting
finish
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
but
doesnt
make
this
any
less
drinkable
or
refreshing
a
pleasant
surprise
smell
is
very
sweet
reminds
me
of
summer
fruits
apricots
and
peaches
mild
citrus
orange
maybe
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
a
lot
of
english
pales
ive
had
it
relates
to
a
belgian
a
bit
more
sans
the
awesome
complexity
mellow
spices
vanilla
soft
mouthfeel
despite
initial
tongue
bite
finished
quite
bitter
hid
its
extra
alcohol
exceptionally
very
very
drinkable
id
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
next
time
a
recommended
ale
forsure
overall
an
excellent
beer
extremely
drinkable
highly
recommended
it
has
the
building

but
seems
to
have
none
of
the
refinments
to
make
it
a

dont
be
put
off
by
other
reviews
if
youre
travelling
to
australia
stay
away
from
carlton
vb
tooheys
etc
this
beer
is
what
australia
is
all
about
class
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
ton
of
floaties
and
a
half
inch
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
weak
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
it
has
a
light
hop
and
slightly
fruity
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
dry
yet
mildly
sweet
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
was
a
let
down
i
really
was
expecting
something
better
overall
fairly
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
especially
as
a
hot
weather
refresher
drinkability
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
rather
unremarkable
other
than
the
carbonation
cant
say
i
would
pick
it
out
of
a
crowd
the
last
drink
is
definitely
the
best
i
e
with
the
sediments
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
brew
the
large
amount
of
sediment
may
turn
some
off
but
it
really
is
a
fine
beer
this
may
become
one
of
my
favorite
hotweather
brews
try
some
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
real
thin
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
i
suppose
the
cloudiness
could
have
something
to
do
with
my
pouring
but
i
cant
figure
out
how
to
pour
this
stuff
clear
without
leaving
4
fingers
of
beer
in
the
bottle
and
im
unwilling
to
waste
that
much
beer
anyway
it
has
a
pleasant
sweet
yeasty
aroma
has
a
pretty
sweet
taste
not
too
bitter
just
enough
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
sweet
and
creamy
all
in
all
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
gotta
watch
it
though
doesnt
take
many
of
these
to
get
you
slurring
at
5
8
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
found
the
sediment
to
be
unappetizing
and
id
prefer
something
with
just
a
little
more
flavor
complexity
overall
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
not
worth
a
second
try
a
refreshing
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
bet
very
hoppy
when
tasted
again
the
malts
are
in
the
background
but
despite
the
strong
hop
bite
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
that
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
tastes
very
much
like
it
smellsbig
on
the
organic
flavor
nothing
artifiical
here
bitter
upfront
lots
and
lots
of
bread
sweeter
yeast
in
the
middle
ending
crisp
pretty
good
i
wasnt
exactly
sure
what
a
sparkling
ale
was
so
i
decided
to
buy
this
and
try
it
out
poured
pale
yellow
with
a
substantial
amount
of
yeast
beautiful
white
head
lasted
for
the
entire
beer
and
left
trails
down
the
empty
glass
taste
was
pretty
mellow
a
bit
weaker
than
a
standard
ipa
id
try
it
again
a
pretty
average
ale
lacking
in
flavour
overall
very
nice
its
a
little
like
someone
wanted
to
make
something
reminiscent
of
duvel
but
needs
a
lot
of
work
to
get
there
it
was
my
favorite
aussie
beer
of
the
round
table
beer
night
in
brisbane
but
be
aware
it
only
is
reviewed
so
positively
in
comparison
to
other
australian
beers
which
were
mostly
unremarkable
so
therefore
i
have
to
give
this
beer
an
average
score
it
aint
bad
but
the
alcohol
taste
made
it
not
good
maybe
ill
try
again
next
time
and
see
if
my
thoughts
change
a
very
unique
beer
almost
always
solid
a
great
summer
session
beer
cloudy
dirty
overripe
peach
orange
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aromas
of
watermelon
fruit
yeast
and
suggestions
of
bready
malt
and
a
citrusy
hop
bouquet
grainy
yeasty
toffeeish
bread
malt
flavors
up
front
mixed
with
some
fruity
esters
hops
are
modest
but
do
the
job
perfumey
and
citrusy
finish
is
yeasty
and
bitter
with
light
candiedfruit
overtones
medium
bodied
pale
ale
with
a
nice
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
better
than
expected
notes
quite
delicious
very
balanced
and
very
very
drinkable
yet
light
enough
to
be
approachable
to
most
beer
drinkers
it
was
tucked
into
those
one
of
those
great
beers
of
the
world
that
many
of
us
beerlovers
where
given
for
christmas
sadly
most
of
the
beers
fall
remarkably
short
of
said
accolades
coopers
sparkling
ale
is
drinkable
but
ultimately
forgettable
im
pretty
sure
i
didnt
notice
it
at
the
time
of
purchase
but
the
cap
has
a
price
sticker
of
2
99
on
it
i
wouldnt
pay
99
cents
for
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
i
was
going
to
say
that
ive
now
had
an
australian
beer
that
beats
fosters
no
mean
feat
i
know
but
now
im
not
so
sure
this
beer
from
down
under
will
now
go
down
under
my
kitchen
sink
as
it
splashes
down
the
drain
coopers
is
arguably
drunk
by
the
most
loyal
drinkers
in
australia
possibly
followed
by
matilda
bay
drinkers
this
may
be
due
to
the
aussie
battler
spirit
sticking
up
for
the
familyowned
breweries
which
the
big
brewers
are
always
trying
to
extinguish
but
it
is
even
more
due
to
the
fact
that
their
beers
are
reliably
great
and
the
fact
that
every
beer
is
subtly
different
in
flavour
and
texture
anyone
that
knows
anything
about
beer
in
australia
drinks
coopers
the
remainder
drink
vb
or
carlton
draught
because
theyre
cheaper
coopers
sparkling
is
an
excellent
beer
by
an
excellent
brewery
overall
this
was
an
all
right
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
doesnt
taste
like
a
hefe
however
in
fact
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
of
anything
its
light
theres
some
malt
but
otherwise
bleh
finishes
clean
enough
but
there
was
nothing
there
to
begin
with
cost
is
just
too
prohibitive
to
employ
this
as
a
quaffer
i
took
a
big
chance
buying
this
one
the
last
time
i
sampled
it
was
in
the
bleak
days
of
the
1980s
when
few
imports
were
coming
ashore
remember
when
guinness
came
in
the
nip
sized
bottles
6
34
oz
it
is
about
6
months
past
its
best
by
date
as
printed
on
the
carrier
still
and
all
it
was
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
truly
sparkling
alas
it
was
unremarkable
otherwise
very
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
a
faint
floral
aroma
and
a
clear
chill
hazed
pour
with
short
lived
minimal
lace
taste
was
crisp
and
sparkiling
no
real
malt
or
hops
on
the
nose
or
the
tounge
good
enough
to
consider
thier
other
products
but
not
much
else
12
7
ounce

quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
but
devoid
of
character
pours
a
hazy
deep
gold
color
with
a
big
off
white
head
and
decent
lacing
a
mass
of
tiny
bubbles
compete
with
little
chunks
of
yeast
for
my
attention
the
bubble
are
more
like
dots
than
anything
really
interesting
looking
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
pear
and
orange
also
a
little
bit
of
crackerlike
malt
the
taste
is
very
fruity
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
theres
a
minute
wet
cardboard
flavor
in
the
finish
that
doesnt
take
away
from
this
beer
but
is
definitely
noticeable
with
every
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
somewhat
thick
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
would
be
great
with
some
kind
of
red
meat
back
in
bc
after
a
six
year
hiatus
this
beer
is
a
welcome
summer
refresher
hazy
orange
gold
this
brew
has
a
fruity
smooth
flavour
which
though
not
huge
is
very
drinkable
the
bottle
sedimentation
adds
to
the
feel
that
this
is
not
a
mass
produced
fizzy
lager
but
rather
a
classic
aussie
beer
brewed
to
higher
standards
i
can
drink
a
few
bottles
easily
and
find
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
a
lager
on
a
hot
day
a

this

pours
a

with

taste
is
a
little
lemony
and
refreshing
a
unique
beer
very

in
flavor
and
everything
else
it
comes
a
cross
between
a
wheat
ale
and
pale
ale
all
together
a
decent
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
be
searching
it
out
in
the

builds
with

so
for
the
hot
days
thius
is
a
very
satisfying
and
refreshing
oldstyle
bottle
conditrioned
ale
a
wonderful
treat
at
the
price
s
d
this
is
actually
a
pretty
tasty
light
ale
light
and
a
little
on
the
spritzy
side
pours
a
bit
cloudy
since
this
apparently
isnt
a
filtered
beer
nice
soft
springlike
fruitiness
reminding
me
mostly
of
melons
an
pears
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
id
consider
this
a
great
summer
beer
as
its
got
a
little
taste
but
is
nice
and
crisp
overall
a
highly
quaffable
brew
which
ill
be
undoubtablly
be
sessioning
over
the
warm
summer
months
maybe
just
with
a
more
careful
pour
next
time
overall
an
average
to
bland
wheaty
beer
though
it
came
off
very
flat
tasting
to
think
about
it
this
is
as
far
from
anything
i
would
consider
to
be
sparkling
as
i
was
sipping
i
could
not
get
over
the
appearance
of
this
one
so
i
have
no
option
but
to
say
that
this
was
on
my
worst
list
drinkability

its
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
but
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
i
find
this
highly
drinkable
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
see
how
many
flavors
i
can
identify
a
little
bit
of
everything
in
this
beer
just
watch
your
yeast
intake
as
it
has
its
own
exhaustive
effect
um
down
the
road
good
aussie
drop
and
for
the
price
is
basically
unbeatable
here
in
oz
a
good
pale
ale
over
all
coming
in
just
a
bit
behind
little
creatures
interesting
ale
from
down
under
this
little
brew
came
from
the
bottle
with
big
flakes
of
sediment
and
a
cloudy
apricotcolored
body
with
a
good
offwhite
head
that
held
well
and
laced
with
gusto
the
nose
is
very
fruity
and
that
sense
follows
in
the
flavor
as
well
nice
taste
but
a
bit
too
acidic
the
feel
is
better
with
a
nice
snap
in
the
finish
that
is
quite
nice
very
drinkable
ale
appearance

about
it

crisp

bready

with
a
decent

to
it
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
anything
that
really
sets
it
apart
from
anything
else

just
couldnt
picture
craving
for
another
one
of
these
brews
glad
i
sampled
thats
about
it
if
youre
not
from
australia
i
can
say
this
is
a
beer
best
consumed
fresh
and
is
even
better
on
tap
than
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
in
a
sea
of
dismal
lagers
and
light
color
wise
beers
in
this
country
and
even
worldwide
this
is
truly
a
giant
of
a
beer
very
easy
drinking
simultaneously
full
flavored
aroma
is
a
little
anemic
but
dominated
with
some
esters
flavor
begins
fruity
is
that
banana
and
closes
with
a
nice
almostcitrus
hop
bitterness
that
is
far
from
overpowering
truly
balanced
not
a
bad
beer
though
the
taste
hints
are
slight
and
im
unsure
whether
the
beer
should
have
this
much
sediment
this
is
still
enjoyable
nonetheless
the
real
australian
for
beer
i
enjoyed
this
well
enough
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
i
think
ill
be
giving
it
another

has
one
of
the
most
curious
appearances
ive
ever
encountered
a
cloudy
light
amber
with
enough
suspended
particles
in
it
to
make
it
look
like
there
is
sand
floating
in
my
beer
when
held
up
to
the
light
how
australian
although
it
reminds
me
of
that
motocross
scene
in
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
aroma
is
of
sweet
boozy
cirtusy
malt
flavour
has
a
sweet
yeasty
tang
to
it
a
bit
boozy
not
much
body
to
carry
it
all
perhaps
i
picked
up
an
old
case
of
this
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
at
all
notes
sparklingits
downright
glittering
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
treat
it
possesses
an
almost
ginger
alelike
carbonation
yet
it
is
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
the
yeast
fruit
grains
all
work
together
quite
well
worth
checking
out
on
a
hot
summer
day

mouthfeel
fairly

made
moreso
by
the
everlasting

prickly

carbonation
quite
a
refreshing
beer
this
bottle
conditioned
ale
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
that
has
a
thin
and
light
head
the
nose
was
a
bit
weak
and
fruity
but
nice
pleasant
the
flavor
is
a
fruity
malt
flavorored
by
the
hops
in
a
nice
and
balanced
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
effervescent
the
finish
is
hoppy
with
a
moderate
lemonycitrus
taste
quite
an
unusual
and
unique
beer
a
sparkling
ale
with
yeast
and
cloudiness
initially
there
is
a
sour
almost
skunky
smell
and
taste
once
you
get
past
that
a
nice
spritzy
fruitiness
appears
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
goes
nice
abv
lets
you
feel
it
not
an
elite
beer
by
any
means
but
give
them
credit
for
doing
something
different
looks
kind
of
like
a
wheat
beer
minus
the
head
very
little
retention
or
lace
the
appeal
is
the
fruitiness
and
it
is
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
refreshing
creamy
ale
bottle
conditioned
pours
like
ginger
ale
bubbles
cling
to
sides
no
head
at
all
i
poured
half
a
glass
and
it
was
clear
and
had
a
crips
taste
of
earthy
pride
of
ringwood
hop
i
poured
the
rest
and
the
yeast
sediment
clouded
it
all
up
ive
not
seen
yeast
sediment
in
this
type
of
beer
be
so
loose
and
pour
so
easily
the
sediment
made
it
slightly
sour
not
too
impressed
hazy
straw
colored
if
poured
without
yeast
and
murky
like
an
ugly
homebrew
if
poured
with
the
yeast
fizzy
white
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
smells
kinda
fruity
definitely
from
the
yeast
same
fruitiness
is
there
on
a
larger
scale
in
the
taste
nice
solid
pale
malt
backbonehop
bitterness
combines
very
nicely
with
alcohol
and
yeast
for
a
fairly
dry
finish

with
lots
of
fine
grained
floaties
and
plenty
of
upcharging
bubbles
to
replenish
a
nice
smallbubbled

laces
quite
simply
fruity
apple
and
citrus
aromas
a
little
yeast
the
malts
dominate
the
flavor
in
a
light
and
clean
manner
senses
of
apple
and
peach
with
a
simple
finish
a
little
overcarbonated
to
me
but
helps
stand
in
place
for
the
reserved
hopping
there
is
a
creaminess
here
as
well
not
bad
as
a
somewhat
unique
beer
not
a
personal
favorite
for
me
either
after
getting
over
how
much
sediment
was
floating
around
i
began
a
very
smooth
pale
ale
it
was
pleasantly
hopped
and
had
a
great
balance
of
malts
that
made
it
an
overall
winner
extremely
drinkable
you
could
definitely
sit
back
with
more
than
a
few
murky
offering
due
to
extreme
sediment
concentration
the
body
is
full
with
a
fruity
aroma
of
apples
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
changing
to
a
malty
finish
nippy
on
the
tongue
at
first
then
passes
seems
very
dry
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
gold
with
little
head
carbonation
is
very
visible
in
the
form
of
loads
of
tiny
bubbles
that
constantly
make
their
way
up
the
glass
nose
holds
a
variety
of
fruit
smells
notably
apples
and
a
slight
yeast
aroma
fairly
clean
flavor
profile
with
hints
of
fruit
and
sugary
sweetness
hops
are
not
present
at
all
in
flavor
but
due
give
a
little
body
and
bitterness
to
the
finish
finish
is
clean
crisp
and
dry
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
but
definitely
not
my
style
michael
jackson
actually
gives
this
beer
its
own
category
in
his
beer
companion
and
describes
it
as
an
early
breed
of
british
pale
ale
adapted
to
colonial
conditions
with
that
thought
in
mind
it
does
seem
perfectly
suited
for
the
australian
climate
crisp
and
light
but
also
full
of
flavor
great
for
winter
or
summer
im
also
amazed
at
the
way
this
beer
can
be
poured
crystal
clear
or
entirely
cloudy
two
possible
beers
from
one
bottle
poured
carefully
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
with
a
golden
appearance
and
the
clearly
visible
carbonation
of
tiny
rising
bubbles
with
the
yeast
its
a
murky
orangeish
but
tends
to
give
a
better
head
and
has
much
more
character
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
notes
of
apple
and
banana
the
flavor
follows
in
much
the
same
manner
but
with
much
more
intensity
although
theres
not
much
malt
in
the
aroma
there
is
some
in
the
flavor
the
hops
seem
to
be
used
only
for
bitterness
and
give
a
dryness
to
the
flavor
and
finish
at
25
bitterness

im
glad

got
a

so
i
can

is

this
was

my
favorite
aussie
ale
of
the
few
ive
drunk
i
dunno
if
im
corrrect
on
this
but
some
years
back
this
was
availiable
in
the
oilcan
bottleor
should
i
say
can
conditioned
with
a
massive
creamy
head
a
subtle
belgian
ale
fruitiness
to
it
a
good
beer
but
i
just
feel
that
its
lost
a
lot
lately
nice
fruity
notes
of
apricot
and
pear
and
good
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
belgian
character
but
is
a
bit
subdued
this
is
an
interesting
one
strong
initial
fruit
notes
and
a
ciderlike
fragrence
followed
by
a
bit
of
hoppiness
at
the
finish
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
though
nothing
spectacular
appearance
is

such
as
one
would
expect
for
a
bottlefermented
ale
its
been
a
few
years
since
i
have
had
this
beer
it
is
a
pretty
darn
good
english
pale
ale
giving
this
a
5
because
its
a
great
beer
from
a
great
country
i
like
to
call
home
only
aussie
beer
i
can
get
here
in
chicago
pretty
much
which
totally
sux
so
here
i
am
eating
some

and
watching
some
cricket
and
decide
to
try
this
bad
boy
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
still
a
very
tasty
beer
definitely
will
drink
again
im
sorry
but
this
is
something
like
a
a
plain
light
beer
nothing
of
a

the
flavor
is

has
a
background
of

overall
well
balanced
in

but
off
style
in
some
of
the
categories
having
said
that
it
is
still
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
upfront
there
is
a
light
to
moderate
flavor
of
pale
and
grainy
malts
with
minimal
amounts
of
sweetness
that
is
followed
by
light
flavors
of
light
fruitspicy
yeast
and
just
a
light
amount
of
floral
hops
a
light
amount
of
bitterness
is
present
in
the
finish
and
fades
away
fairly
quickly
o
light
and
refreshing
somewhat
thirst
quenching
this
would
be
a
good
sessionable
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
definitely
coopers
most
popular
beer
and
their
best
seller
although
they
have
better
beers
such
as
best
extra
stout
and
extra
strong
vintage
ale
this
is
the
one
that
they
are
best
known
for
decent
flavours
across
the
palate
and
now
for
a
good
price
at
au44
a
case
though
i
think
they
usually
retail
closer
to
50

pale

from
australia

i
like
this
one
even
though
im
not
a

fan
of
the
citrus
if
i
ever
move
to
australia
i
think
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
coopers
awesome
beer
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
flavour
albeit
on
the
weak
end
of
the
flavour
scale
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
soda
with
lime
a
tad
on
the
bland
side
but
crisp
and
refreshing
not
the
best
coopers
brew
but
its
usually
cheap
on
tap
and
there
is
no
better
beer
in
its
price
range
get
a
cheap
jug
of
this
next
time
youre
at
a
bar
in
an
aussie
uni
made
for
many
good
nights
poured
from
a
brown
12
7
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
actually
a
bit
skunky
taste
is
grains
mild
hops
a
bit
of
malts
refreshing
but
not
exactly
flavorful
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
ok
but
nothing
special
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
too
exciting
either
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
it
again
either
o
what
the
was
that
just
awful
or
did
i
get
a
bad
bottling
pours
a
murky
light
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
tiny
particles
of
sediment
are
seen
suspended
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
yeast
and
some
floral
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
slight
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
pretty
boring
all
around
in
my
opinion
beer
with
yellow
liquid
and
with
good
foaming
with
good
duration
the
foam
is
white
and
the
last
drops
beer
made
from
this
slightly
brown
foam
malt
aroma
in
taste
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
leaving
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
fast
light
beer
good
drinkability
good
for
summer
pretty
decent
quaff
great
as
a
session
beer
but
still
reasonably
flavorful
you
can
really
tell
the
english
influence
which
i
liked
i
wish
i
had
in
my
country
a
major
brewery
with
such
decent
quality
good
beer
for
the
masses
coopers
pale
ale
looks
great
on
account
of
the
bottle
fermentation
and
subsequent
sediment
the
smell
is
ok
as
is
the
taste
its
a
little
too
high
on
the
carbonation
for
my
liking
but
it
will
have
its
adherents
due
to
the
marketing
of
their
unique
approach
to
brewing
decent
and
ok
for
the
summer
i
kinda
liked
this
one
and
could
drink
it
again
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
unusual
hue
fair
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
of
pungent
citrus
notes
accentuate
a
light
bread
malt
and
a
soapy
hop
a
little
grainy
with
a
light
citrusy
hop
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
pretty
bland
and
unexciting
with
not
a
whoe
lot
going
for
it
really
it
didnt
seem
much
like
an
english
pale
ale
or
even
a
golden
ale
to
me
either
it
was
just
so
ordinary
and
bland
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
strong
and
the
body
a
bit
light
with
almost
no
taste
or
smell
to
speak
of
i
would
definitely
never
choose
this
over
coopers
sparkling
ale
and
there
are
a
bunch
of
other
pale
ales
that
are
better
i
tried
coopers
pale
ale
after
a
friend
spoke
highly
of
it
while
in
australia
a
few
years
ago
years
later
trying
it
while
listening
to
a
band
from
australia
maybe
a
faint
grain
malt
smell
the
malt
character
is
bread
yeast
most
of
the
sediment
was
mixed
would
leave
that
out
next
time
not
enough
hops
for
my
liking
ill
stick
with
the
band
before
the
brew
o
classic
pale
ale
a
session
ale
for
hot
wheater
simple
but
pleasant
quite
average
really
not
that
good
of
a
beer
certainly
wont
buy
again
their
sparkling
ale
is
better
wasnt
impressed
with
this
at
all
didnt
make
me
think
of
an
english
pale
at
all
tasted
like
macroswill
quite
like
this
as
an
everyday
type
beer
its
nothing
special
but
id
rather
drink
this
over
a
macro
any
day
of
the
week
would
really
like
to
try
this
one
again
as
i
only
had
it
once
has
a
lovely
appearance
with
the
top
fermenting
and
secondary
fermenting
process
giving
this
one
that
distinctive
coopers
cloudy
appearance
nice
aromas
with
noticeable
hops
and
malts
but
really
nice
how
this
one
does
not
go
overboard
with
the
bitter
taste
it
really
finds
a
nice
balance
and
this
is
one
of
coopers
most
easydrinking
beers
and
should
be
suitable
for
most
palates
this
is
more
of
an
entrylevel
beer
for
a
brewer
that
does
some
interesting
things
and
should
be
recommended
to
anyone
that
wants
to
try
something
other
than
the
multitude
of
lagers
and
carbonated
lagers
that
are
available
having
a
really
pale
ale
like
this
one
is
a
nice
change
with
a
nice
head
nice
taste
and
strikes
a
beautiful
balance
this
is
highly
recommended
for
those
wanting
a
step
up
from
the
ordinary
lager
but
someone
who
doesnt
have
as
much
experience
as
other
drinkers
its
a
solid
beer
overall
much
nicer
than
i
remember
but
then
its
the
first
time
ive
had
it
without
condensation
around
the
glass
i
think
its
citrusy
wateriness
suits
the
scorching
aussie
heat
o
fairly
low
profile
pale
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
drinkable
when
faced
with
lesser
alternatives
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
semi
darkdirty
blonde
with
a
gritty
body
and
is
topped
off
with
a
tan
thick
head
thats
very
frothy
and
has
hints
fermentation
it
has
some
faint
smells
of
lemons
apple
and
orange
its
crisp
and
harsh
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
the
hops
are
pretty
present
but
not
overpoweringit
is
slightly
bitter
overall
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
bitterness
becomes
more
tames
in
its
aftertaste
it
does
has
a
light
to
medium
mouth
feel
i
love
coopers
sparkling
ale
their
stout
their
vintage
but
this
really
is
a
blemish
on
their
reputation
and
thats
always
been
the
case
im
afraid
pours
a
clear
typical
sunny
yellow
with
a
decent
if
not
persistent
white
head
aroma
is
hello
ok
not
strong
just
malty
a
teeny
fruity
nothing
special
but
still
acceptable
malty
flavor
has
hints
of
fruit
and
hops
and
is
on
the
wan
side
smooth
texture
has
average
body
and
little
fizz
this
is
best
as
a
party
beer
or
along
with
a
meal
o
could
have
been
better
than
it
was
not
a
terrible
beer
but
pretty
forgettable
od
quite
lemony
and
not
too
interesting
of
a
pale
ale
doesnt
really
fit
the
style
but
its
decently
enjoyable
quite
cheap
as
well
another
worthy
brew
from
coopers
no
regret
for
picking
it
up
o
with
lager
being
nearly
the
only
option
at
most
pubs
of
the
area
its
nice
to
find
something
to
revive
a
guy
from
a
boredom
induced
coma
there
are
better
examples
of
oz
pale
ale
but
there
are
worse
too
this
is
worth
a
try
pours
an
opaque
amber
with
foamy
energetic
head
that
dissipates
quickly
little
on
the
nose
except
some
bread
notes
flavour
is
crisp
and
bready
but
no
midpalate
which
makes
it
a
little
unsatisfying
pride
of
ringwood
hops
are
very
bland
and
are
a
common
oz
hop
which
explains
a
lot
i
suppose
drinkability
is
good
with
a
nice
sparkly
mouthfeel
so
it
is
good
at
a
bbq
not
a
great
beer
for
arts
sake
o
boring
and
lacking
im
not
sure
what
the
goal
of
this
beer
was
but
it
misses
it
on
all
fronts
overall
not
remarkable
though
still
better
than
the
average
joe
beers
around
o
this
is
a
very
basic
boring
beer
i
know
that
the
beer
is
suppose
to
be
like
this
but
man
i
want
more
hops
just
not
very
good
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
golden
color
and
a
ton
of
flakey
sediment
in
the
bottle
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
and
then
there
were
some
malt
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
crisp
i
thought
leaving
a
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
isnt
too
bad
its
light
and
drinkable
overall
not
my
favorite
pale
ale
they
could
have
filtered
it
a
little
better
i
think
but
too
each
hisher
own
overall
its
not
too
bad
better
than
other
nonbelgian
pales
ales
ive
tried
but
nothing
id
seek
out
in
the
future
o
easy
drinker
not
a
unique
pale
ale
but
still
an
enjuoyable
beer
goes
good
with
food
sorry
coopers
i
wanted
to
like
this
ill
give
you
a
try
on
tap
if
i
ever
make
my
way
down
under
but
until
then
its
adieu
to
coopers
pale
ale
probably
my
favourite
bottled
pale
ale
right
now
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
pale
ale
with
some
saisonlike
hops
a
great
pale
ale
for
people
who
appreciate
hops
but
dont
seek
their
overwhelming
dominance
in
a
beer
you
know
what
in
australia
where
by
and
large
beer
is
awful
and
over
priced
this
coopers
product
really
gets
the
job
done
its
much
more
of
a
beer
than
tooheys
or
carlton
or
any
of
the
other
domestic
offerings
and
its
available
everywhere
pours
a
cloudy
bottleconditioned
golden
color
with
a
good
head
on
it
its
a
crisp
beer
with
a
body
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
i
cant
count
the
nights
i
split
a
slab
of
these
with
the
boys
on
the
beach
always
refreshing
and
even
better
on
tap
if
you
live
in
australia
this
makes
a
great
daily
brew
o
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
extradionary
but
pretty
well
rounded
and
balanced
o
what
a
shame
i
find
this
brewery
can
definitely
make
some
good
beer
its
just
their
pale
ale
recipe
is
quite
mediocre
i
was
expecting
a
fair
bit
more
than
this
overall
a
decent
beer
that
suffers
a
bit
from
comparisons
to
style
guidelines
note
not
reviewed
to
style
pours
a
see
through
pale
straw
hue
with
floaties
and
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
only
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
grainsherbal
hops
and
pale
maltsthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
white
grapesgrains
and
herbal
hops
and
overall
another
average
big
aussie
brewery
beer
thats
better
than
a
couple
but
not
alot
bland
and
at
times
unenjoyable
this
is
a
very
meh
drop
of
ale
o
theres
nothing
particularly
unique
about
the
taste
but
it
is
very
light
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
this
would
make
for
a
very
sessionable
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
pour
good
and
all
the
yeast
settles
at
bottom
of
bottle
so
my
glass
was
pretty
with
this
beer
if
you
see
it
buy
it
may
not
be
you
but
buy
it
i
could
drink
a
few
and
be
ok
for
a
while
not
a
typical
pale
ale
in
my
sense
but
a
good
beer
b
o
fairly
solid
beer
i
reckon
id
pick
this
one
up
on
occasion
in
the
future
its
got
pretty
solid
drinkablility
given
its
basic
flavor
profile
not
the
best
aussie
beer
ive
had
but
solid
prefer
out
of
bottle
actually
more
complex
o
tasty
but
not
the
pale
ale
i
was
expecting
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
with
a
bit
more
hops
and
this
one
was
certainly
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
im
wondering
if
its
an
age
thing
and
they
mellowed
or
if
its
meant
to
be
rather
light
on
the
hops
dr
its
unfairly
priced
and
not
particularly
good
even
for
the
style
d
good
to
kick
back
a
few
and
enjoy
light
on
the
flavor
but
very
refreshing
perfect
lawnmower
beer
d
given
the
abv
i
can
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
away
food
match
grilled
chicken
or
fish
with
a
light
salad
drizzled
with
balsamic
vinegar
maybe
calamari
or
other
seafood
crab
lobster
a
classic
aussie
pale
ale
with
plenty
to
like
d
all
in
all
this
is
an
extremely
sessionable
brew
it
may
npt
be
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
something
that
you
could
drink
all
day
long
on
a
hot
summer
day
liam
its
an
odd
tasting
take
on
the
style
but
it
sure
is
easy
enough
to
drink
despite
the
overload
of
carbo
fruity
aromas
greet
the
nose
with
a
yeasty
background
this
is
carried
through
in
the
taste
which
has
some
light
grapefruit
notes
and
good
grain
characteristics
that
are
hard
to
isolate
due
to
the
exuberant
carbonation
enough
hops
to
brighten
the
flavor
but
not
too
bitter
or
overpowering
altogether
a
mellow
mouthful
drinkability
while
in
sydney
ive
had
this
several
times
both
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
im
only
reviewing
this
on
tap
since
that
is
where
it
shows
best
also
based
on
the
bottles
ive
had
in
sydney
im
suspecting
that
the
subtle
flavors
involved
here
simply
dont
stand
up
well
to
being
bottled
and
shipped
great
distances
the
beer
when
fresh
is
lightly
crisp
quite
refreshing
to
drink
and
a
great
option
when
out
for
an
evening
with
friends
once
upon
a
time
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
beer
mainly
directly
from
the
stubby
my
palate
has
changed
a
lot
since
then
know
i
find
it
nowhere
as
drinkable
still
a
good
starting
point
for
lager
drinkers
to
get
into
ales
im
a
little
surprised
this
one
doesnt
get
more
love
i
liked
it
but
its
a
pricey
here
in
alberta
im
a
fan
of
coopers
beers
they
are
easy
to
get
hold
of
here
and
are
good
value
taste
was
just
carbonation
and
corn
very
light
mouthfeel
no
hops
might
as
well
call
this
coors
light
or
fosters
and
its
expensive
forget
you
there
just
wasnt
any
redeeming
quality
in
this
beer
drinkability
flavor
and
feel
are
pretty
darn
good
though
this
beer
basically
smells
like
nothing
it
is
refreshing
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
indeed
a
lemony
pale
with
a
light
color
of
yelloworange
has
a
hop
quality
more
so
than
anything
else
not
too
good
for
a
malt
character
giving
it
a
lack
luster
body
nose
of
lemon
and
lemon
grass
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
grassy
beer
not
particularly
sweet
in
palate
with
a
citrus
quality
hop
no
really
finish
of
bitter
some
protein
after
a
bit
had
much
better
from
this
brewery
overall
a
very
nicely
sweet
beer
with
lots
of
indulgent
flavours
of
chocolates
and
sweets
d
low
abv
and
nothing
seriously
wrong
make
it
drinkable
just
nothing
special
d
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
it
its
not
really
a
pale
ale
though
what
is
it
really
above
average
sierra
is
probably
a
more
flavorful
and
cheaper
option
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
too
i
bet
most
of
the
really
bad
reviews
here
had
some
pretty
old
bottles
newfresh
this
one
is
pretty
hard
to
dislike
very
subtle
malt
taste
no
roasted
grains
very
little
hop
bitterness
and
a
semitart
flavor
very
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
below
average
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
bad
or
what
but
something
is
just
off
about
it
had
this
cold
from
the
bottle
showing
a
slightly
orangeish
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
fair
white
head
and
minor
lacing
noted
a
good
deal
of
brownish
sediment
at
the
bottom
like
cinnamon
the
nose
picks
up
a
decided
sour
mash
and
bayberry
sort
of
a
dry
grass
hop
perhaps
the
flavor
gives
a
pretty
good
grassy
kick
again
a
dry
hop
effect
fairly
sharp
and
no
sweetness
its
hard
to
pick
up
much
else
a
little
malt
maybe
way
in
the
background
and
a
cloveorange
hint
if
you
stretch
your
imagination
it
has
a
spicy
overtone
fair
carbonation
in
a
mid
to
light
body
the
feel
is
generally
crisp
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
aqueous
i
cant
say
this
floats
my
boat
but
i
can
drink
it
would
be
fine
with
pizza
but
otherwise
not
one
to
search
out
drinkable
but
not
highly
desirable
d
low
alcohol
and
low
flavor
so
yeah
drinkable
although
i
wouldnt
be
bothered
having
more
than
one
because
i
dont
enjoy
it
enough
d
goes
down
ok
but
i
would
only
drink
it
with
a
meal
on
its
own
its
a
little
mundane
d
can
drink
several
of
these
easily
solid
beer
but
if
you
are
a
hophead
avoid
this
beer
you
will
be
disappointed
much
smoother
and
balanced
than
the
apa
style
this
is
no
longer
one
of
my
first
choices
in
australia
for
accessible
beer
little
creatures
is
far
more
aggressive
and
bolder
than
this
still
think
coopers
stout
sparkling
and
vintage
ale
are
far
superior
to
this
if
i
grade
this
against
au
apas
this
is
a
d
as
an
epa
it
is
a
good
beer
and
a
good
choice
for
a
sunday
session
i
think
holds
up
well
against
the
uk
style
not
heavy
but
very
flavorful
for
a
refreshing
type
beer
miss
it
greatly
some
imported
bottles
in
the
us
draught
is
the
way
to
go
and
yes
it
was
rolled
d
somewhat
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
a
bad
macro
alternative
in
a
place
that
doesnt
offer
craft
beers
poured
from
a
12
7
ounce
stubby
bottle
with
best
after
date
on
label
light
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
scents
of
sweetness
other
than
that
no
outstanding
smell
crisp
flavor
with
citrus
notes
little
bit
of
spice
notes
more
hoppy
than
malts
pretty
mild
flavor
very
subtle
very
drinkable
drinkability
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
not
too
bad
overall
i
remember
it
being
more
flavorful
when
i
was
halfway
around
the
world
and
im
sure
it
loses
at
least
a
little
bit
of
flavor
when
its
not
fresh
not
one
to
seek
out
but
not
a
terrible
option
bought
this
at
a
foreign
grocery
store
in
beijing
craving
a
taste
of
real
beer
i
was
not
particularly
impressed
by
this
offer
from
coopers
it
poured
cloudy
opaque
and
strawgold
into
the
cup
about
one
finger
of
head
from
the
smell
i
got
mostly
the
bitterness
of
hops
perhaps
a
slight
hint
of
butter
if
you
are
looking
for
it
the
taste
really
accented
the
bitterness
of
hops
also
leaving
almost
no
trace
of
malt
or
pine
or
citrus
or
anything
else
its
crisp
if
not
a
little
bit
fizzy
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
to
me
neither
interesting
nor
really
enjoyably
wellbalanced
d
there
is
no
depth
just
a
pungent
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
no
real
malt
flavors
overall
it
is
one
of
the
better
mass
produced
australian
beers
if
you
do
plan
to
come
to
australia
this
should
be
a
good
place
to
start
your
tour
of
what
is
on
offer
right
up
there
with
little
creatures
pale
ale
as
the
best
pale
ale
in
australia
to
my
knowledge
anyway
one
of
the
more
common
ales
to
be
found
at
your
average
pub
used
to
be
my
mainstay
but
recently
james
squire
golden
ale
has
taken
over
as
the
beer
i
drink
when
i
cant
see
anything
better
on
offer
its
drinkable
this
is
true
but
it
isnt
really
what
id
expect
for
a
beer
of
this
style
or
any
beer
really
drinkability
not
bad
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
half
a
finger
of
head
with
not
much
retention
on
the
pour
taste
is
like
a
mildly
sweeter
fruity
corona
or
something
very
very
grainy
not
a
flavor
i
would
like
to
enjoy
often
very
fizzy
mouthfeel
harsh
d
the
sparkling
ale
was
decent
but
this
beer
is
a
mess
with
a
puckering
astringency
that
puts
this
one
in
the
skip
it
category
for
me
drinkability
just
not
much
happening
here
perhaps
good
for
a
hot
day
a
very
interesting
pale
ale
not
a
gold
winning
but
still
good
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
light
some
lemon
tea
like
characteristics
the
taste
is
lemony
perhaps
some
green
apple
skins
light
grassy
notes
and
an
earthy
bitterness
in
the
end
the
feel
is
light
and
very
fizzy
a
bit
tart
on
the
palate
finishes
quite
dry
an
ok
epa
probably
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
too
dry
could
use
more
malt
flavor
not
bad
but
not
really
a
pale
ale
in
bearing
theres
just
no
sweetness
to
the
malt
and
that
becomes
a
drag
after
a
short
while
dryness
usually
has
lots
to
recommend
it
but
it
must
be
used
much
more
deftly
than
it
is
here
one
and
done
im
afraid
the
taste
is
light
very
subdued
and
a
bit
thin
but
its
persistent
and
it
at
least
hold
up
well
it
has
light
grain
that
lasts
from
start
to
finish
with
a
faint
bubblegum
quality
near
the
finish
along
with
toasted
grain
initially
there
is
brief
sweetness
with
definite
grassy
bitterness
and
flavour
coming
up
before
the
finish
the
start
seems
a
buit
creamy
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
bit
watery
p
s
its
better
than
fosters
wow
i
had
quite
a
different
experience
than
the
rest
of
you
bottle
drinkers
i
am
sorry
but
its
a
nice
sessionable
pa
great
with
a
fish
nchips
or
back
deck
beer
very
watery
too
much
carbonation
375ml
bottle
pours
nearly
opaque
ruddy
gold
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
some
sediment
present
smells
of
honeylike
malt
with
some
faint
floral
character
tastes
of
sweet
grainy
malt
and
a
bit
of
pepper
with
only
the
slightest
bitterness
at
the
end
fairly
weak
and
boring
pale
and
a
cloudy
orange
color
without
the
cloudiness
get
it
no
head
smells
faintly
of
budweiser
sigh
very
light
flavor
macrolager
bitterness
surely
its
being
served
too
cold
here
would
being
warmer
help
it
well
it
would
probably
take
some
of
the
bite
off
and
it
might
not
seem
quite
so
overcarbonated
but
would
it
help
i
dont
really
think
so
ive
tried
coopers
pale
ale
a
few
times
now
and
im
always
left
a
little
unsatisfied
its
bottle
conditioned
and
it
looks
and
smells
very
interesting
it
pours
a
murky
wheatbeer
sort
of
texture
with
a
decent
head
and
has
a
nice
bit
of
bacteria
floating
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
its
smells
fresh
and
hoppy
too
yet
while
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
the
taste
is
disappointing
its
refreshing
alright
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
hoppy
bite
of
a
good
pale
ale
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
it
certainly
beats
the
hell
out
of
any
of
the
more
commercial
australian
beers
but
i
just
feel
it
promises
a
bit
more
than
it
delivers
interesting
brew
but
not
a
love
at
first
sight
this
brew
is
crisp
and
light
as
i
drink
it
it
is
definitel
refreshing
good
for
drinking
while
out
in
the
sun
an
improvement
over
say
fosters
or
heineken
for
sure
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
whole
σ
parts
not
a
bad
beer
not
world
shattering
but
not
a
disappointment
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
clear
with
some
sediment
head
dissipates
quickly
no
collar
or
laciness
faint
citruis
hoppy
scent
with
some
malt
taste
is
also
faint
with
hops
and
malt
slight
bitterness
and
decent
balance
not
robust
with
flavor
on
the
watered
down
side
decent
body
and
thin
texture
not
a
bad
beer
on
the
light
side
could
handle
a
couple
of
these
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
day
this
poured
a
golder
amber
the
smell
was
weak
but
hinted
at
a
flowery
aroma
the
taste
was
like
the
aroma
was
weak
not
bad
overall
but
weak
it
presented
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
rather
drink
pabst
blue
ribbon
my
favorite
cheap
beer
than
this
stuff

my
first
foray
into
good
beer
started
with
unfiltered
wheat
beers
this
reminds
me
of
a
very
average
wheat
beer
it
is
drinkable
mild
smooth
crisp
and
sweet
i
could
drink
this
on
a
summer
afternoon
while
enjoying
some
bbq
or
i
could
drink
this
with
a
few
friends
over
this
is
a
definite
session
beer
for
me
but
nothing
spectacular
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
lighter
bodied
and
nice
mouthfeel
all
in
all
this
is
an
easydrinking
pale
ale
that
would
do
well
in
the
summer
or
springtime
months
nothing
too
complex
or
bold
but
still
nuanced
enough
to
get
the
job
done
yuck
i
like
pale
ales
i
like
blond
ales
and
i
even
like
unfilteredbottle
conditioned
ales
i
e
alesmith
extra
pale
this
beer
tastes
like
none
of
the
above
its
almost
as
if
it
was
preskunked
pours
cloudy
copper
with
plenty
of
floaties
stinky
nose
of
sour
fruit
and
malt
dry
harsh
grainy
taste
with
fruity
hops
that
i
cant
quite
place
sour
not
bitter
aftertaste
keep
this
downunder
mate
d
moderate
flavor
and
moderate
drinkability
would
get
boring
quickly
highly
carbonated
beer
that
does
go
down
smooth
i
wont
be
running
out
to
get
this
one
again
d
nothing
great
but
still
enjoyable
overall
a
dull
brew
an
averagely
ok
beer
nothing
special
nothing
stand
out
something
you
drink
with
pizza
or
other
strong
flavored
foods
the
taste
has
a
hint
of
lemony
tartness
once
things
settle
a
bit
but
overall
the
beer
is
quite
crisp
but
also
very
smooth
there
is
a
combination
of
bittering
hops
and
peppery
spice
in
the
finish
the
beer
isnt
particularly
dry
and
it
might
have
some
florals
hidden
underneath
but
the
peppery
bite
in
the
finish
is
what
is
most
pronounced
and
is
the
signature
element
to
this
beer
the
beer
is
decent
but
it
lacks
the
creaminess
the
hop
esters
and
the
old
world
taste
to
make
this
an
interesting
epa
if
you
have
the
itch
to
try
coopers
go
for
their
sparkling
beer
which
is
much
better
drinkability
however
is
pretty
damn
good
a
bottle
of
this
is
great
to
commence
with
friends
over
and
a
great
looking
beer
coopers
is
certainly
a
great
summer
brew
to
indulge
into
poured
a
nice
translucent
orange
color
with
carbonation
bubbles
floating
around
the
center
of
the
beer
little
head
that
fizzled
to
just
about
nothing
smell
was
a
nice
mix
of
grainy
malts
and
some
floral
hops
plus
a
touch
of
sweetness
orange
taste
overall
was
fairly
bland
generically
malty
flavor
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
at
the
end
but
not
much
became
more
watered
down
as
it
warmed
up
and
the
taste
evaporated
from
my
mouth
within
seconds
of
swallowing
it
it
was
better
than
a
macro
light
beer
it
was
a
more
full
body
and
nice
carbonation
but
it
was
a
farily
forgetable
beer
and
i
had
no
intention
of
drinking
another
d
taste
is
ok
smell
blows
it
is
so
light
you
can
drink
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
its
not
bad
but
i
wanted
more
because
i
am
such
a
fan
of
the
coopers
sparkling
ale
ah
well
not
every
girl
at
the
party
is
going
to
be
pretty
poured
a
very
hazy
golden
golder
with
a
lot
of
little
floaties
hanging
about
not
much
in
the
way
of
foam
or
lacing
but
otherwise
looks
pretty
good
smell
is
right
up
there
as
well
good
hop
aroma
backed
up
by
some
sweet
malts
taste
is
about
average
definite
malt
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
crisp
fruity
hop
middle
and
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
average
carbonation
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
an
average
pale
and
i
like
them
unfiltered
like
this
one
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
phoenix
landing
in
cambridge
last
saturday
night
this
is
not
a
bottle
you
see
often
at
an
irish
bar
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
poured
into
a
hoegaarden
style
short
pint
glass
orange
color
bit
cloudy
lots
of
carbonation
smell
was
a
bit
hoppy
taste
was
above
average
if
i
had
to
choose
between
a
bass
and
this
id
go
with
this
beer
a
bit
lighter
and
smoother
a
nice
surprise
drinkability
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
really
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
sort
of
sour
and
skunky
not
very
good
taste
is
better
the
beer
is
sort
of
cidery
with
a
hint
of
malt
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
balance
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
slightly
high
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
tastes
ok
but
i
would
not
consider
this
an
english
pale
ale
it
tastes
much
more
like
an
americanized
kolsch
im
not
going
to
be
purchasing
anymore
of
this
pale
ale
however
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
this
brew
i
will
likely
buy
other
coopers
brewery
beers
in
order
to
round
my
australian
tastes
drinkability
is
bad
this
brew
is
very
weak
in
flavor
not
to
mention
the
watery
texture
not
impressive
feels
overly
carbonated
but
not
a
bad
beer
much
better
ice
cold
tends
to
get
too
sweet
as
it
warms
very
unremarkable
beer
itll
sit
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
for
a
good
long
wile
maybe
ill
use
it
to
steep
some
brats
in
that
might
be
something
honestly
this
reminded
me
very
much
of
molson
canadian
a
lager
in
both
smell
and
taste
next
time
ill
grab
molsonill
know
what
im
getting
and
its
much
cheaper
ordinary
d
its
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
the
flavour
dies
off
far
too
quickly
and
it
leaves
somewhat
of
an
unpleasant
minerally
metallic
aftertaste
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
d
good
quite
easy
to
drink
and
completely
sessionable
at
4
5
has
its
weaknesses
appearance
being
the
most
glaring
but
its
one
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
i
liked
it
and
would
certainly
enjoy
trying
this
brewerys
other
offerings
however
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
i
would
agree
with
others
on
this
site
that
its
worth
a
try
the
skunk
left
after
a
bit
of
breathing
in
my
glass
its
unfiltered
and
bottle
conditioned
qualities
saved
this
one
from
being
a
cc
d
very
drinkable
but
i
would
prefer
something
a
little
stronger
in
the
taste
d
a
very
good
session
or
social
beer
the
light
body
makes
is
go
down
easy
very
unassuming
perhaps
a
good
beer
for
a
macro
drinker
who
wants
to
get
their
feet
wet
with
better
beers
i
would
buy
this
again
meh
ive
enjoyed
better
versions
of
the
english
pale
ale
mostly
from
england
the
coopers
is
okay
but
not
great
id
call
it
a
lawnmower
beer
certainly
better
than
a
macro
alternative
but
not
my
first
or
second
choice
off
the
shelf
pours
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
floaties
in
it
almost
like
a
wheat
ale
with
a
very
fizzy
head
from
a
massive
amount
of
carbonation
it
does
have
a
hoppy
scent
but
its
very
faint
and
weak
not
very
crisp
clean
or
fresh
it
has
a
decent
taste
nothing
great
the
flavor
and
feel
is
almost
like
a
wheat
ale
too
clean
and
crisp
very
refreshing
but
it
has
a
very
low
hoppybitter
aspect
to
it
it
does
go
down
very
smoothly
though
its
worth
a
try
but
there
are
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
unless
youre
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
thirst
quenching
than
hoppy
very
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
much
a
dead
one
lawnmower
beer
light
beer
for
a
hot
climate
not
horrible
and
certainly
cheaper
than
other
import
ales
here
in
bejing
d
i
expected
more
out
of
it
nothing
really
special
just
ok
but
its
better
than
a
macro
drinkability
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
its
winter
here
and
lots
of
winter
ales
are
available
but
its
summer
in
australia
and
thats
what
i
think
this
beer
is
for
its
sort
of
like
a
fosters
pale
ale
a
pseudomicro
suitable
as
a
paleale
lawnmower
beer
not
bad
to
drink
but
nothing
really
special
just
mighty
thin
for
this
time
of
year
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
onefinger
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
maltybready
and
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
thin
and
biscuitybready
also
somewhat
fruity
fades
very
thin
in
the
aftertaste
little
or
no
hop
bitterness
just
not
too
impressive
here
barely
drinkable
seeing
as
they
are
from
australia
the
tag
makes
sense
pours
a
hazy
hay
yellow
with
a
some
head
retension
and
attempts
at
lacing
before
settling
down
to
a
fairy
robust
white
ring
no
overly
complex
aromas
some
floral
hop
and
slight
husky
grainy
malt
hop
and
carbonation
tend
to
bite
the
hop
really
takes
hold
with
a
dry
almost
puckering
feel
some
smooth
grainy
maltiness
makes
the
ride
more
than
one
dimensional
found
it
a
bit
overcarbonated
initially
but
otherwise
a
decent
ale
that
could
serve
as
a
decent
thirst
quencer
due
to
the
dryness
of
the
aftertaste
had
this
at
a
poker
party
not
to
long
ago
not
that
it
is
that
rare
of
a
beer
but
a
guy
from
australia
brought
this
and
the
sparkling
ale
did
not
get
a
chance
to
try
that
one
though
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
i
find
it
about
the
same
as
macro
lager
crap
next
time
i
go
for
the
sparkling
ale
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
nice
golden
hue
with
specks
of
sediment
floating
about
a
little
hazy
but
not
completely
as
i
didnt
pour
all
of
the
yeast
into
the
glass
nice
bready
yeast
smell
with
a
small
hidden
citrus
hint
nice
hops
taste
but
surprisingly
not
too
bitter
smooth
feel
with
a
sweet
but
disappointing
finish
worth
a
try
but
nothing
spectacular
not
bad
for
my
first
coopers
this
would
be
a
decent
summer
beer
recommended
if
you
are
interested
in
trying
something
else
other
than
fosters
from
the
land
down
under
the
mouth
is
slick
with
lots
of
carbonation
may
be
a
good
hot
weather
beer
but
it
really
is
one
and
done
for
me
golden
ale
in
colour
with
a
large
thick
off
white
head
aroma
is
pretty
weak
just
malty
slightly
caramel
pretty
basic
malty
flavoured
ale
a
touch
of
grassy
hop
and
la
touch
of
citric
palte
is
quite
nice
but
nothing
stunning
average
beer
all
round
pours
out
a
hazy
gold
brew
with
one
finger
head
that
dissipates

a
bit

one
i
would
crave
either
mouthfeel
is
okdrinkability
is
ok
also
i
dont
know
if
i
could
totally
session
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
case

7oz

clearly

pours
a
slightly
golden
yellow
color
with
one
finger
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
extremely
faint
with
just
a
touch
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
much
like
the
aroma
is
pretty
underwhelming
in
flavor
with
some
malt
and
ops
in
a
dry
and
watery
finish
overall
this
was
simply
not
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
aroma
and
tastes
were
watered
down
and
the
mouthfeel
was
overly
fizzy
not
recommended
drinkable
d
not
a
bad
call
when
it
comes
to
value
for
money
it
was
priced
the
same
as
xxxx
vb
and
fosters
this
one
is
easier
to
drink
then
victoria
bitter
since
less
polluted
by
aussie
favorite
pride
of
ringwood
taste
was
also
very
poor
deasy
drinking
yet
there
are
some
complexities
to
it
the
complexities
arent
neccessarily
what
the
type
i
love
but
it
does
make
it
interesting
straw
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
but
little
head
strange
bit
of
dark
colored
sediment
at
the
end
i
say
hooray
for
bottleconditioning
smells
a
bit
of
apple
candy
definitely
heavy
on
the
pale
malts
as
befits
the
english
style
a
bit
of
leafy
hops
came
out
on
the
finish
its
thin
and
fizzy
but
i
think
it
tastes
decent
enough
and
it
certainly
would
work
well
as
a
session
pale
ale
im
thinking
summer
barbecues
for
this
one
btw
regarding
what
other
reviewers
have
written
i
found
this
has
much
more
of
the
subtle
characteristics
of
an
english
pale
or
mild
ale
than
of
macro
lager
would
definitely
drink
this
over
heineken
any
day
the
carbonation
is
very
good
lots
of
small
bubbles
very
drinkable
light
easy
beer
not
good
for
solo
consumption
needs
to
be
a
food
accompaniment
also
ita
be
better
really
cold
da
not
to
shabby
concidering
this
stuff
travels
a
long
way
the
pizza
restaurant
next
door
to
my
work
has
this
alongside
the
typical
euro
lagers
shitty
mainstream
aussie
beers
so
it
comes
in
handy
from
time
to
time
if
im
eating
there
this
gem
pours
out
looking
like
cloudy
and
dirty
white
grapefruit
juice
has
a
thin
ring
of
head
this
really
smells
akin
to
a
macro
lager
just
clean
and
with
nothing
standing
out
flavor
is
grainy
and
nearly
tasteless
like
drinking
a
cocktail
of
90
club
soda
and
10
beer
light
and
fizzy
doesnt
begin
to
describe
the
mouthfeel
here
id
take
a
budweiser
or
coors
banquet
over
this
any
day
i
taste
expecting
maybe
this
sampole
is
spoiled
but
it
doesnt
really
seem
so
i
just
get
slightly
skunky
old
noble
hops
booze
soapiness
and
a
cracked
grain
finish
its
not
doin
much
for
me
really
and
that
smell
is
just
horrendous
drainpour
md
its
ok
its
solid
but
too
weak
and
waery
too
macro
in
nature
though
that
may
not
be
fair
or
descriptive
enough
sweet
bubblegum
and
sugarcane
in
the
aroma
progressing
into
a
lite
and
tasty
quaff
sweetish
molasses
lemon
and
toffee
also
sneak
in
there
fairly
reminiscent
of
a
summer
wit
brew
finishes
crisp
and
clean

i
could
go
for
a
sixer
of
these
critters
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
stuff
is
pure
magic
as
it
is
really
refreshing
even
when
it
is
not
ice
cold
the
yeast
residue
may
put
off
some
but
when
drinking
it
is
hardly
detectable
this
is
a
little
more
expensive
than
the
mainstream
aussie
beers
but
then
it
is
better
quality
so
actually
pretty
good
value
not
the
most
interesting
pale
ale
but
its
easydrinking
affordable
and
above
all
tastes
pretty
damn
good
you
could
drink
this
a
long
time
but
it
might
sour
after
a
few
still
drinkable
and
not
too
bad
probably
willnt
buy
again
though
hohum
this
beer
comes
off
like
a
pale
euro
lager
even
though
its
an
ale
this
is
probably
because
its
fairly
light
but
has
a
mellow
creamy
fruit
without
any
specific
fruit
discernible
flavor
basically
its
light
and
sweet
beer
you
know
its
like
heineken
and
its
ilk
with
a
little
heavier
mouthfeel
and
a
bready
aroma
slightly
let
down
by
this
beer
as
expected
something
more
perhaps
its
a
grower
felt
there
was
a
blandness
maybe
needs
to
be
tried
again
overall
a
pretty
much
average
beer
good
for
starters
on
the
style
due
to
its
low
bitterness
it
felt
this
one
was
a
little
bland
and
missing
some
of
the
good
characteristics
i
look
for
in
a
good
english
pale
ale
hop
at
all
no
aftertaste
this
is
a
premium
beer
due
to
its
wellpriced
nature
its
extremely
popular
and
something
ill
continue
to
buy
despite
far
superior
imports
the
body
is
remarkably
light
there
is
little
to
no
mouth
coat
carbonation
is
low
to
moderate
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
very
hazy
dark
yellow
with
a
14
inch
head
that
quickly
faded
but
left
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
slightly
sweet
aroma
but
not
as
strong
as
most
pale
ales
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
the
style
taste
is
very
weak
for
a
pale
ale
resembling
more
of
a
light
lager
than
the
style
it
is
being
passed
as
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
but
if
youre
looking
for
the
characters
of
a
pale
ale
i
would
recommend
looking
elsewhere
this
one
fills
the
glass
with
a
hazy
yellow
liquid
bottle
conditioned
with
tiny
yeast
particles
floating
head
is
short
lived
and
bleached
white
aromas
are
mildly
yeasty
and
bready
and
mild
mannered
hops
that
are
well
behaved
flavours
are
funky
yeast
with
some
semisweet
bready
maltscookie
and
subtle
soft
hops
like
fuggels
finishes
quick
and
fairly
spritzy
session
style
kind
of
a
weird
pale
ale
as
it
has
low
hops
but
a
nice
citrus
finish
that
almost
suggest
belgian
in
its
softness
i
like
this
beer
though
it
doesnt
fit
the
type
like
the
other
coopers
i
have
tried
the
sublte
nuances
are
the
best
part
of
the
beer
you
have
to
slow
down
to
really
enjoy
the
light
mix
of
flavours
d
i
am
only
drinking
it
to
review
it
sad
really
i
will
never
buy
it
again
and
i
was
so
excited
when
i
did
buy
it
because
i
have
worked
at
outback
as
a
side
job
through
college
all
my
life
australian
beer
you
know
what
a
let
down
cheers
other
comments
all
in
all
a
bit
disappointing
i
like
thier
sparkling
ale
but
this
is
like
a
club
soda
with
a
dash
of
pale
ale
had
to
dump
in
the
yeast
dregs
to
get
a
bit
of
flavor
md
if
one
was
to
taste
coopers
for
the
first
time
the
texture
of
this
beer
could
be
overly
spritzy
but
since
ive
luckily
tried
some
of
their
beers
i
guess
i
could
try
to
appreciate
it
from
a
slightly
objective
perspective
this
bottle
shows
a
more
lively
yet
still
thin
body
throughout
than
my
last
bottle
maybe
due
to
younger
bottling
yeasts
i
wouldnt
say
id
love
this
beer
as
of
its
own
category
but
for
what
it
is
and
the
brewerys
consistent
efforts
to
make
good
ales
one
has
to
try
this
beer
to
form
hisher
own
fair
judgement
a
different
yeasty
and
dryish
pale
ale
this
is
this
on
is
intersting
for
sure
but
not
very
good
i
dont
really
think
ill
ever
drink
another
one
the
carbonation
is
the
only
thing
making
this
even
slighty
drinkable
im
gonna
hurry
and
get
this
one
down
before
it
gets
warm
and
goes
flat
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
will
be
pretty
disgusting
if
i
let
that
happen
pale
yellow
cloudy
color
thin
bone
white
head
smell
nothing
maybe
a
little
bit
of
malt
taste
very
thin
mouthfeel
watery
drinkability
i
guess
its
a
little
better
than
water
there
is
nothing
really
bad
about
this
brew
its
just
very
bland
which
is
the
only
reason
it
scored
as
high
as
it
did
to
get
1s
there
has
to
be
something
really
wrong
and
i
cant
say
i
noticed
anything
wrong
with
this
one
cant
really
say
i
noticed
anything
at
all
drinkable
but
not
exceptional
really
it
resembles
more
of
a
continental
pilsor
maybe
a
slightly
bitter
hellesthan
a
pale
ale
on
drinking
it
i
noted
that
it
had
an
almost
cordial
quality
to
it
not
really
nasty
but
unimpressive
a
watery
brew
it
be
with
a
seltzer
like
feel
to
it
at
first
before
it
goes
flat
due
to
lack
of
attention
maybe
the
bottle
suffered
in
transit
so
to
be
fair
ill
review
another
bottle
some
day
but
not
in
the
near
future
this
beer
is
a
lighter
shade
of
yellow
with
a
very
thin
head
there
is
a
ton
of
suspended
matter
the
smell
is
strong
the
taste
is
of
a
lighter
beer
with
some
hops
thrown
in
i
guess
this
beer
could
be
sessioned
but
there
are
better
choices
for
that
average
for
a
session
beer
nothing
outstanding
this
beer
is
better
cold
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
will
revisit
again
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
the
residue
of
fermentation
suspended
in
the
bottle
very
little
head
or
lacing
which
kept
this
score
from
going
higher
started
out
slightly
bitter
but
settled
in
around
midbottle
to
a
nice
smooth
tasty
beer
with
a
good
finish
not
quite
qwhat
i
expected
from
a
pale
ale
almost
more
like
a
weiss
at
the
end
but
at
on
4
5
abv
i
could
and
probably
will
drink
several
on
a
hot
day
this
summer
drinks
easy
just
not
much
character
there
for
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
i
remember
this
being
slighlty
better
in
oz
worth
a
shot
especially
as
a
summer
time
change
of
pace
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
yellow
color
aroma
is
quite
piney
topped
off
with
a
citrus
zest
the
taste
is
wonderfully
hopped
and
flavorful
all
citrus
hops
up
front
with
some
kind
of
yeasty
malty
something
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
great
and
drinkability
is
nice
too
this
beer
is
fluent
in
the
citrusy
piney
hop
bigness
that
i
feel
is
too
minimally
done
in
the
other
english
pale
ales
ive
tried
this
is
a
good
beer
here
ill
empty
my
glass
with
satisfaction
upon
opening
of
the
12
7ounce
brown
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
lemon
yellow
with
a
smallish
white
frothy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
rather
thin
coating
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
has
the
rich
aroma
of
malt
citrus
like
in
its
crispness
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
fair
to
middling
grain
presence
and
the
top
feels
moderate
to
my
palate
finish
is
stingingly
acidic
the
hops
pleasantly
spicy
and
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
brew
along
with
a
sixer
of
the
sparkling
ale
supposed
to
hit
109
by
the
end
of
the
week
need
a
clean
refreshing
beer
to
fend
of
the
heat
lol
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
not
unlike
cloudy
apple
juice
probably
would
have
poured
clearer
but
i
rolled
the
bottle
like
the
website
tells
me
to
do
wouldnt
want
to
review
it
under
unfavorable
circumstances
smells
faintly
of
yeast
and
a
little
citrus
taste
is
fairly
yeasty
and
a
little
sweet
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
flavor
not
unpleasant
but
not
great
either
finishes
a
little
sour
mouthfeel
isnt
too
bad
not
creamy
but
no
carbonation
burn
either
all
in
all
its
a
fairly
average
beer
wish
i
could
say
it
was
better
because
i
really
like
coopers
other
beers
no
how
no
way
is
coopers
original
pale
ale
an
english
pale
ale
i
think
these
guys
should
release
coopers
newandimproved
pale
ale
because
this
one
doesnt
cut
it
not
by
a
long
shot
ive
now
had
two
good
to
excellent
beers
from
this
down
under
brewery
best
extra
stout
and
extra
strong
vintage
ale
and
two
lousy
ones
sparkling
ale
and
this
one
maybe
its
time
to
rename
coopers
brewery
limited
the
jekyl
and
hyde
brewing
company
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
there
really
isnt
anything
to
set
it
apart
from
a
bunch
of
other
beers
like
it
there
is
a
bit
of
graininess
to
this
brew
that
you
dont
get
with
others
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
is
a
good
thing
in
this
case
it
is
not
bad
and
is
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
but
with
the
amount
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
it
is
a
shame
to
loose
an
ounce
or
two
on
every
beer
for
one
that
is
just
ok
if
it
was
fresh
and
cheap
i
may
feel
a
little
differently
about
this
beer
perhaps
i
need
to
take
a
trip
to
australia
honestly
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
very
flavorful
either
im
not
going
to
spend
extra
cash
on
an
import
beer
that
is
so
lame
i
am
very
happy
to
see
unfiltered
and
bottle
conditioned
beers
like
this
maybe
my
sample
is
off
but
the
best
by
date
is

its

i
purchased
my
bottle
in

i
can

it

ia
if
i
was
so
inclined
im
not

it
cloudy

a
bottle
conditioned
pale
ale
with
a
neat
bottle
a
stubby
little
bottom
poured
some
sediment
in
left
some
in
the
bottle
a
nice
hazy
but
pale
golden
color
with
fizzy
bubbly
head
with
lacing
at
a
minimum
nose
has
a
little
straw
a
twinge
of
lemon
and
i
think
im
starting
to
get
this
whole
bready
thing
as
im
picking
some
up
here
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
all
things
going
into
a
beer
the
mouth
made
a
good
first
impression
good
carbonation
and
body
lemon
citris
hops
slightly
herbal
i
suppose
balanced
out
by
nutty
somewhat
grainy
malts
and
i
cant
pick
up
much
of
that
yeastiness
i
poured
finishes
smooth
and
crisp
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
too
extraordinary
but
a
very
good
session
beer
something
appropriate
for
pretty
much
any
time
any
where
the
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
a
bit
over
carbonated
i
liked
this
beer
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
for
me
not
a
lot
to
it
but
very
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dissipated
quickly
from
a
1
pint
9
4
ounce
brown
bottle
the
aroma
seems
very
faint
i
can
barely
smell
anything
at
all
i
have
to
say
the
same
thing
about
the
taste
its
quite
light
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
im
sure
i
could
pound
back
quite
a
few
of
these
but
im
not
sure
why
i
would
want
to
better
than
a
macro
lager
i
know
this
is
an
ale
but
not
anything
to
get
excited
about
note
the
beer
is
marked
best
before
210907
which
leads
me
to
believe
two
tings
one
that
it
is
not
very
old
since
there
is
a
lot
of
shelf
life
ahead
so
unless
the
shipping
was
traumatic
my
bottle
should
be
pretty
much
what
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
two
coopers
thinks
their
beers
even
bottled
conditioned
ones
keep
longer
than
they
probably
do
for
years
ive
always
walked
past
coopers
maybe
its
because
every
other
sample
of
brew
ive
tried
from
australia
ive
been
dissapointed
lets
just
say
i
learned
my
lesson
on
being
biased
against
all
offerings
as
this
one
breaks
the
mold
and
breaks
my
bias
solid
offering
and
im
looking
forward
to
sampling
all
of
their
products
the
taste
is
also
mild
biscuity
yeasty
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
finishes
somewhat
dry
and
carbonic
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
slightly
thin
and
flat
but
still
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
some
rusty
looking
sediment
in
the
bottom
12
7
ounce
bottle
coopers
pale
ale
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
color
with
lots
of
white
floaties
the
small
head
quickly
fades
to
nothing
weak
grain
aroma
theres
not
that
much
going
on
in
the
nose
smooth
buttery
malt
flavor
hops
are
more
bitter
than
flavorful
nice
balance
a
little
bit
fruity
bottle
conditioning
gives
this
beer
some
character
but
other
than
that
this
is
just
an
average
pale
ale
pretty
good
drinkability
too
drinkabilityoverall
i
could
knock
these
back
all
day
refreshing
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
smooth
ive
had
this
beer
for
ever
since
i
started
drinking
and
it
has
always
been
a
fave
this
one
was
particularly
nice
not
much
of
a
head
or
lacing
on
this
one
bright
yellow
in
color
but
cloudy
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
a
little
bit
of
sediment
in
the
glass
but
i
tried
to
keep
most
of
it
in
the
bottle
smells
like
a
lager
to
me
mostly
sweet
malts
tastes
like
a
lager
too
but
not
bad
with
pale
malts
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
light
dry
and
smooth
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
real
big
in
the
flavor
department
its
not
such
a
bad
beer
charlie
brown
for
the
distance
this
beer
must
travel
and
the
low
abv
i
thought
this
beer
fared
surprisingly
well
poured
an
ambertinged
gold
lively
carbonation
some
tiny
brown
flecks
of
sediment
that
can
be
avoided
with
careful
decant
overall
the
character
was
quite
bright
with
some
bavarian
lagerlike
influences
a
bit
fizzy
and
light
not
a
bad
session
beer
overall
i
preferred
the
sparkling
ale
that
i
tried
last
night
but
this
is
another
very
nice
flavorful
brew
from
the
coopers
brewery
real
aussie
ale

brewed
in
australia
so
says
the
neck
label
heres
to
listening
the
2nd
day
of
the
5th
and
final
test
of
the
2005
ashes
from
the
oval
on
the
bbc
world
service
in
a
few
hours
time
gud
on
ya
mate
a
cloudy
ale
similar
in
looks
to
a
wheat
beer
with
a
bright
white
head
that
likes
to
stick
to
the
side
of
the
glass
not
a
whole
lot
of
smell
faint
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
smell
not
nearly
the
citrus
smell
as
its
sparkling
ale
brother
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
nothing
at
all
offensive
about
this
beer
but
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
either
a
good
summer
session
brew
overall
i
hope
that
this
beer
was
not
a
true
representative
for
this
brew
maybe
it
was
spoiled
but
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
try
another
one
label
710
not
that
much
of
an
head
and
golden
beercolor
big
particles
floating
in
it
nose
is
making
shure
this
one
is
filled
with
lots
of
oxigen
sweet
hint
of
orange
with
it
some
malts
detectable
taste
is
almost
horrible
completely
oxidated
taste
and
no
bitterness
anymore
watery
creamy
sauce
to
me
that
was
a
poorout
after
just
some
tiny
sips
hopefully
its
not
always
as
bad
as
this
bottle
i
tried
but
off
course
it
came
a
long
way
a
little
too
pale
for
a
pale
ale
looks
murky
yellow
much
like
a
wheat
beer
moderate
carbonation
white
dense
head
with
nice
retention
smells
a
little
malty
and
a
little
fruity
like
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
quite
sour
smelling
for
a
pale
ale
faint
hop
aroma
tastes
fruity
like
citrus
lemons
and
oranges
faint
hop
flavor
and
souring
low
hop
bittering
beer
gets
weak
through
the
body
and
finish
bitter
grainy
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
acidic
and
metalic
thin
and
remains
a
bit
sour
some
vegetable
like
and
earthy
not
a
particularly
good
pale
ale
but
glad
i
tried
it
tastes
like
a
failed
attempt
of
an
american
blonde
note
if
you
empty
the
entire
bottle
int
a
glass
you
will
get
a
cloudy
beer
this
beer
sits
right
around
average
i
like
the
bottle
conditioned
character
but
question
the
hops
in
this
brew
there
seems
to
be
no
aromatic
hops
whatsoever
leaving
the
smell
very
dull
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
but
the
yeasty
character
is
overwhelming
with
this
absence
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
bad
but
some
floaties
seem
to
tingle
in
my
mouth
drinkability
is
average
i
would
choose
this
beer
over
some
but
not
many
good
one
drink
the
sparkling
ale
instead
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
something
good
either
a
definite
out
of
the
aussie
macros
and
if
i
can
find
it
cheap
enough
an
excellent
chugging
or
beirut
beer
it
is
not
a
good
beer
to
follow
on
from
big
beers
unless
you
are
suffering
from
palate
fatigue
and
need
a
refresher
it
is
however
a
good
beer
to
choose
from
the
tap
when
you
are
limited
in
your
other
choices
hold
it
up
to
other
mainstream
australian
tap
beers
and
it
an
excellent
session
beer
a
pretty
crappy
and
bland
ale
similar
to
the
sparkling
ale
but
this
is
actually
worse
time
to
crack
the
goudenband
and
get
some
flavour
on
these
taste
buds
pours
golden
with
a
rapidly
dissipating
white
head
a
little
cloudy
from
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
has
a
light
aroma
of
grass
and
citrus
a
little
more
on
the
taste
with
the
slightest
bannna
as
well
nice
crisp
taste
with
a
mild
bitterness
thats
just
a
little
more
than
other
aussie
beers
ive
had
full
slick
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
but
i
did
have
a
slight
headache
the
next
day
likely
more
quantity
related
drinkability
notes
a
decent
pale
thankfully
this
is
unfiltered
and
bottle
conditioned
and
was
able
to
retain
a
good
amount
of
character
not
as
good
as
the
sparkling
ale
but
something
id
definitely
have
again
while
this
is
not
one
of
my
particular
favourites
and
i
do
consider
the
coopers
like
a
little
overrated
here
in
oz
its
a
drinkable
hell
even
enjoyable
beer
taste
was
slightly
hoppy
little
citrus
in
there
and
it
was
quitye
thin
actually
reminded
alot
of
fosters
only
with
a
slightly
hoppy
bite
to
it
pours
a
twofinger
white
head
that
goes
quickly
leaving
nothing
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
lot
of
chunky
bits
medium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
nose
is
faintly
hoppy
starts
with
a
light
mix
of
hops
and
malts
with
the
hops
dominating
hoppy
finish
but
not
a
lot

i

the

into

easy
drinking
yet
boring
beer
yawn
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
fruity
english
yeast
finish
t
seems
a
bit
bitter
and
bisquity
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
zing
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
light
and
a
bit
watery
i
dont
detect
much
in
the
hop
department
it
is
dry
and
musty
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
pale
ale
at
best
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
and
what
little
it
has
sucks
its
one
and
done
for
me
the
taste
is
that
of
a
light
bitter
with
the
late
introduction
of
a
sweet
biscuit
that
tones
down
the
bitterness
but
ever
so
lightly
would
have
been
much
better
with
more
carbonation
very
smooth
drinking
unfortunately
the
bar
would
not
give
me
a
glass
they
did
not
have
any
the
carbonation
was
very
weak
sweet
hops
with
a
backnote
of
what
made
me
think
of
vanilla
the
sweet
hops
came
with
the
finish
they
were
eversoslightly
bitter
at
first
but
quickly
became
sweet
good
drinkability
would
be
a
good
beer
for
potential
crossovers
poured
from
a
12
7
oz
whoohoo
an
extra
7
oz
bottle
its
vibrant
gold
with
lots
of
floating
yeasty
bits
the
yeast
settles
at
the
bottom
with
a
reddish
tint
that
makes
it
look
a
bit
like
a
pile
of
rust
the
smell
and
taste
are
lightly
fruity
with
hops
that
are
just
detectable
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
flavor
it
went
down
well
over
a
hot
barbecue
on
a
scorching
midsummer
afternoon
this
beer
is
a
clear
rich
gold
with
hallucinations
of
amber
a
cloudy

pour
turns
it
an
opaque

and
adds

some

and

in
the

a
little
nutty
and
quite
bitter
the
middle
turns

quenching

this
is
a

with
a

pleasant
drinkability
was
not

bad
this
reminded
me
of
a
wheat
beer
rather
than
a
pale
ale
wouldnt
be
too
bad
on
a
hot
day
although
under
other
circumstances
i
would
not
rush
out
to
buy
it
altogether
a
decent
looking
beer
with
a
nice
smell
to
it
but
the
appearance
is
below
average
head
dissipated
very
quickly

seemed
citrusy
sweet

kind
of
thick
yeasty
taste
at
first
leaves
a
funky
gym
sock
aftertaste
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
overall
ive
had
worse
but
thought
this
would
be
better
pretty
basic
easy
drinking
pale
still
a
much
better
alternative
to
the
usuall
draught
offerings
around
drinkability

i
was
able
to
finish
this
one
but
it
was
very
unpleasant
and
i
will
definitely
not
buy
again
onto
the
2nd
beer
of
the
world
this
immediately
reminded
me
of
apple
cider
in
appearance
cloudy
with
a
lot
of
sediment
no
head
to
speak
of
nice
citrusy
smell
and
citrusy
hop
finish
but
the
taste
is
definitely
lacking
a
lot
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
nothing
that
holds
my
interest
i
would
drink
this
beer
if
offered
to
me
but
would
definitely
not
buy
it
a
lightly
hazy
gold
color
it
forms
a
white
head
when
roused
in
my
glass
a
weak
beery
aroma
emanates
from
my
glass
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
notes
as
well
fairly
mild
tasting
it
ends
with
a
bit
of
carbonic
acid
bite
slightly
bready
and
a
tad
too
thin
really
not
much
here
not
offensive
but
nothing
worth
drinking
either

il
go
for
the
sparkling
ale
any
day
of
the
week
but
occasionally
if
im
looking
at
a
long
night
and
i
want
a
nice
intro
to
a
big
night
of
drinking
this
is
a
fair
place
to
start
its
not
hard
to
drink
a
worse
beer
in
australia
than
this
one
while
its
not
a
huse
beer
its
quite
tasty
and
stacks
up
well
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
beers
i
could
be
drinking
locally
this
poured
strangely
a
hazy
yellow
color
thin
head
and
large
chunks
of
sediment
i
did
not
expect
this
the
small
head
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
weak
barely
a
hint
of
hops
was
present
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
medium
bodied
the
malt
flavor
was
most
prevelent
with
some
hints
of
fruit
slight
bitterness
came
through
on
the
aftertaste
drinkable
but
not
overly
exciting
coopers
original
pale
ale
from
australia
i
am
immediately
struck
by
how
cloudy
this
beer
is
does
not
spill
out
a
lot
of
head
the
color
is
yellow
with
a
deep
orange
tint
the
aroma
is
somewhat
cidery
hmm
this
beer
does
not
quite
want
to
leave
an
impression
on
me
a
bare
wisp
of
malt
sweetness
and
it
quickly
disappears
there
are
some
fruitcitrus
flavors
here
but
little
aftertaste
of
hops
in
fact
not
much
taste
at
all
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
which
just
helps
it
leave
the
palate
that
much
more
quickly
i
guess
youd
call
this
a
session
beer
because
there
isnt
much
to
it
appearance
cloudy
golden
orange
tint
with
a
nice
creamy
textured
white
head
no
lacing
forms
on
this
one
aroma
a
slight
citrus
note
here
a
bit
zesty
with
deep
bready
malt
tones
heavy
sediment
as
well
adds
to
the
breadiness
i
speak
of
taste
a
mild
biscuit
sweetness
with
some
balancing
light
hops
main
component
here
is
the
yeast
and
malt
tones
providing
for
a
bready
finish
and
overall
profile
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
somewhat
of
a
residual
texture
that
coats
the
tongue
not
bad
at
all
very
nice
crisp
tone
brought
on
by
the
medium
body
and
mild
carbonation
drinkability
not
crazy
but
solid
ale
from
austrailia
just
glad
to
see
another
brand
other
than
fosters
on
american
shores
another
good
coopers
beer
probably
a
bit
less
than
the
sparkling
ale
but
i
dont
think
the
gap
is
that
great
ill
probably
definitely
have
this
one
again
overall
a
good
simple
ale
had
a
friend
who
drank
this
alot
on
tap
in
australia
during
a
recent
trip
we
finally
located
the
beer
here
in
chicago
and
he
claims
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
in
aust
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
bit
of
sediment
if
you
look
close
this
is
what
i
call
a
slammer
beer
not
overly
memorable
but
real
easy
to
drink
id
be
happy
to
shoot
some
pool
and
suck
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
dark
aussie
pub
the
nose
is
rather
malty
and
hints
of
sweet
corn
the
taste
also
is
a
bit
maltycorny
with
just
a
faint
bit
of
cloying
fruitiness
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
my
only
fear
is
that
in
a
lot
of
brews
that
i
encounter
this
maltycorny
character
i
find
that
it
means
adjunctfiller
and
henceheadache
i
call
it
the
pbr
syndrome
never
drink
more
than
three
in
a
sitting
i
dont
think
ill
drink
more
that
two
or
three
of
these
at
time
to
play
it
safe
not
a
bad
little
slammer
though
all
in
all
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
little
citrusy
and
a
little
hoppy
but
neither
is
very
assertive
thin
to
mediumbodied
with
flavors
of
hops
wheat
and
fruit
finish
is
a
little
flat
and
fruity
i
enjoyed
their
stout
but
this
beer
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
pours
a
murky
light
golden
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
flakes
of
sediment
rise
and
fall
in
the
streams
of
carbonation
rendering
the
appearance
of
a
snow
globe
the
lacing
is
quite
good
aroma
consists
of
bready
yeast
and
citrus
hops
taste
begins
with
lively
carbonation
light
malts
and
lemony
hops
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
towards
the
dry
finish
leaving
in
their
wake
a
crisp
citrus
oil
bitterness
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
pleasant
a
refreshing
warm
weather
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
tiny
yet
noticeable
flakes
of
sediment
floating
in
the
beer
the
head
is
creamy
white
and
fades
into
a
good
amount
of
lace
nose
is
sourdough
bread
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
malts
and
a
mild
fruitiness
followed
by
some
nutty
yeast
flavors
some
bitter
hops
and
acidic
lemon
notes
come
through
in
the
end
leaving
a
crisp
finish
a
pretty
nice
pale
ale
but
nothing
special
overall
a
fairly
average
aussie
pale
ale
great
potential
that
never
seems
to
go
anywhere
nice
visually
with
good
aroma
but
no
balance
in
the
taste
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
imo
kinda
liked
this
onethe
guy
at
the
beer
store
said
the
bottle
was
sitting
there
for
awhile
but
it
held
up
great
real
hazyorange
color
with
a
good
headsmelled
fresh
and
citriusybody
was
a
little
thin
to
me
for
the
style
refreshing
taste
with
some
citriusyeast
note
very
easy
to
drink
i
also
think
this
would
be
a
good
warm
weather
ale
i
dont
know
that
this
beer
is
a
pale
ale
or
a
lager
o
k
the
label
says
pale
ale
but
a
very
cloudy
pale
gold
topped
by
a
nice
sugar
white
head
lacing
was
solid
and
offset
the
rather
strange
color
and
appearance
fresh
lager
like
aroma
was
standard
taste
was
pretty
standard
too
but
had
a
bit
of
lemony
zest
to
it
and
actually
was
quite
refreshing
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
warm
weather
quaffer
this
sample
came
out
of
a
beers
of
the
world
gift
box
i
have
never
seen
this
brew
anywhere
before
now
hazy
orange
color
under
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
fresh
and
fruity
notes
of
peach
apricot
some
citrus
mellow
mouthfeel
decent
showing
of
hops
but
very
minimal
bitterness
and
a
lackluster
finish
pleasant
and
sweet
but
nothing
really
sticks
out
a
fine
session
ale
if
you
dont
mind
unassuming
easygoing
flavor
in
your
mug
extremely
light
hazy
straw
color
fine
suspended
yeast
particles
are
visible
from
bottle
conditioning
nose
is
fruity
with
granny
smith
apples
bosc
pear
notes
odd
very
nontraditional
english
pale
actually
reminds
me
more
of
a
wheat
beer
with
similarities
to
a
belgian
wit
interesting
brew
and
very
drinkable
too
the
cloudiness
is
part
of
the
character
and
charm
of
this
bottle
conditioned
beer
its
goldenpeach
in
color
with
a
bold
rocky
brightwhite
head
that
holds
extremely
well
as
its
constantly
buoyed
by
an
intense
effervescence
and
leaves
some
excellent
lace
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
lightly
malty
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
when
combined
with
the
very
fine
effervescent
carbonation
as
well
as
its
light
acidity
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
crisp
the
flavor
offers
the
standard
coopers
yeast
character
with
lots
of
fruitiness
apples
pears
apricot
mild
banana
and
a
good
deal
of
hop
bitterness
theres
a
light
acidity
and
a
minor
hop
flavor
from
pride
of
ringwood
it
finishes
dry
with
just
a
minimal
lingering
yeastiness
very
nice
quite
similar
to
their
sparkling
ale
but
with
far
less
character
cloudy
gold
with
a
large
foamy
head
head
had
very
good
retention
and
eventually
became
a
fine
lace
which
left
rings
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
appearance
aside
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
smell
had
very
faint
malt
and
hop
presence
with
nothing
else
really
going
on
slightly
malty
taste
with
a
slightly
acidic
bite
not
at
all
complex
and
not
what
i
would
call
an
english
pale
ale
coopers
pale
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
substantial
head
which
left
some
decent
lace
in
the
glass
not
to
mention
some
yeast
there
werent
any
particular
smells
that
popped
out
at
me
tastewise
this
beer
was
relatively
dull
there
was
a
hint
of
hops
and
some
malt
profile
but
not
enough
of
either
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
grainy
and
dry
for
this
style
this
is
average
beer
hazy
dark
straw
in
hue
topped
by
a
quickly
dissapating
head
flecks
of
yeast
ride
the
released
carbonation
similar
in
appearance
to
the
sparkling
ale
but
a
touch
more
hazy
and
lighter
in
color
the
aroma
consists
of
tart
fruity
esters
and
mild
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
theres
not
much
else
there
the
hop
nose
is
a
touch
citric
and
a
woody
and
earthy
pride
of
ringwood
hop
flavor
is
discernable
the
malt
profile
of
this
brew
is
subdued
and
light
and
much
of
its
character
is
provided
by
the
signature
fruity
yeast
esters
only
a
light
sweetness
and
bready
note
is
perceptible
in
the
finish
the
high
carbonation
lends
an
almost
prickly
mouthfeel
but
the
overall
crisp
and
light
nature
of
this
brew
lends
it
good
drinkability
coopers
pale
exhibits
no
outstanding
qualities
but
is
flavorful
enough
to
make
it
a
very
drinkable
session

balance
mostly
a
mild
flowery

impression
in
mid
mouth
but
far
from
overpowering
ok
beer
in
most
aspects
not
complex
but
with
subdued
impressions
of
both
malts
and
hops
in
the
british
style
a
little
chalkiness
in
the
mouth
though
a
good
beer
but
i
guess
its
not
my
style
kind
of
reminded
me
of
bass
but
a
mile
better
very
drinkable
in
summer
refreshing
and
slightly
fruity
flavor
reveals
a
diacetyl
note
initially
fruity
specialty
malt
and
toasted
bread
dominate
finishing
floral
and
lightly
dry
carbonation
is
almost
effervescent
so
far
the
best
schlaflys
beer
ive
had
from
their
regular
line
simple
and
easy
drinking
side
note
these
are
now
available
in
cans
which
may
make
this
my
new
go

third
schlafly
beer
ive
tried
never
disappointed
with
them
this
was
a
very
good
ipa
this
brew
is
amber
in
color
with
a
white
head
of
medium
thickness
clear
the
aroma
is
ready
moderately
malty
and
is
backed
with
a
faint
hop
scent
it
isnt
as
intense
as
i
would
have
liked
but
it
is
a
solid
and
drinkable
brew
balanced
delicious
pale
ale
folks
went
to
st
louis
over
the
weekend
and
brought
me
some
great
copper
color
spicy
front
with
a
malty
after
taste
not
a
session
for
sure
a
great
dinner
beer
i
dont
taste
a
lot
of
hops
palate
4
about
what
youd
expect
overall
british
style
pale
ale
with
some
earthy
hop
flavor
i
think
the
high
carbonation
detracted
a
bit
from
the
beer
well
brewed
but
i
prefer
hop
forward
pale
ales
this
is
definitely
outside
my
definition
of
a
pale
ale
so
rating
it
against
the
style
is
tricky
for
me
however
i
love
it
its
a
fantastic
beer
that
hits
the
spot
regardless
of
the
time
of
year
see
it
grab
it
poured
from
a

12

very

filled
with
pale

along
the
lines

the

get

o
this

encapsulates
averageness
in
the
craft
beer
realm
rarely
have
i
had
a
crappy
example
of
the
style
but
i
dont
think
ive
ever
fallen
in
love
with
an
example
and
this
fits
into
that
zeitgeist
perfectly
not
bad
not
great
worth
drinking
again
but
not
really
worth
buying

less
what

from

smooth

with
not

feel
is
a

generally
ok
i
could

plenty
at
a
party
if
i
had
to
i
would
be
skeptical
to
by
another
with
no
dates
on
the
bottle
o
this
is
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
a
very
faint
smell
but
a
surprisingly
wellbalanced
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
it
simple
quality
is
sometimes
the
best
this
american
pale
is
very
good
no
lingering
mineral
finish
here
as
with
some
british
cousins
must
be
that
missouri
water
a
beautiful
copper
and
butterscotch
color
in
the
midday
sun
it
reminds
me
of
a
mild
troegs
hop
back
amber
with
more
session
ability
i
would
recommend
this
pale
ale
if
you
previously
thought
you
did
not
care
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
contrast
from
the
hoppedup
american
pale
ales
and
if
youre
into
a
more
easydrinking
style
of
pale
ales
this
is
good
with
a
wide
availability
and
pretty
good
price
point
its
hard
to
find
an
english
pale
ale
stateside
that
is
this
good
recommended
oa
dud
from
schlafly
no
reason
to
try
this
other
than
the
tick
fruit
is
not
the
star
in
this
beer
the
hops
have
a
bright
and
vivid
quality
to
impart
to
the
caramel
malt
the
yeast
leans
into
the
brew
a
bit
sour
to
compliment
the
spice
and
the
bread
carries
it
away
this
is
a
hearty
and
rich
pale
ale
with
a
full
mouthfeel
thats
crisp
this
was
a
real
treat
as
compared
to
the
cookie
cutter
pale
ales
you
normally
see
that
try
to
imitate
an
ipa
original
and
civilized
overall
quite
a
good
english
pale
ale
possibly
the
best
english
pale
ale
i
have
had
lately
and
just
enough
flavor
and
low
abv
to
make
even
a
light
beer
drinker
happy
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
has
a

perhaps
a

highly
drinkable
light

crisp
abundant

a
very
tasty
english
pale
ale
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
guess
this
was
an
import
from
across
the
pond
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
pale
ale
that
is
less
hoppy
and
more
restrained
than
some
of
the
big
hoppy
pale
ale
that
are
so
commonplace
nowadays
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
liked
it
at
first
but
i
notice
that
the
flavor
has
grown
on
me
after
a
second
bottle
and
i
like
it
more
still
not
an
amazing
pale
ale
and
i
can
think
of
several
i
like
better
but
it
is
a
good
product
nonetheless
pours
to
a
generous
and
lasting
buff
head
with
moderate
lacing
and
iconic
copper
color
aroma
is
caramel
biscuit
yeast
esters
and
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
flavor
is
a
sessionable
and
easygoing
amalgamation
of
the
aforementioned
aromas
with
a
balancing
resiny
hop
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
flavorful
low
alcohol
by
us
craft
standards
session
brew
that
has
balance
and
flavor
on
a
par
with
its
english
counterparts
overall
a
really
sessionfriendly
beer
with
decent
balance
o
this
is
a
smooth
refreshing
drink
notable
for
its
simplicity
and
easy
to
drink
in
quantity
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
specially
but
a
good
standby
that
would
go
well
with
any
kind
of
spicy
or
savory
foo
as
it
did
when
i
had
a
barbeque
the
other
night
o
this
beer
fulfills
what
is
says
it
is
which
is
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
flavorful
enough
to
be
enjoyable
it
isnt
a
beer
id
make
a
point
of
buying
specifically
but
it
works
well
enough
for
what
it
is
nice
englishstyle
pale
with
some
decent
hops
in
the
flavor
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
overall
this
was
a
decent
pa
suffered
from
too
much
carbonation
and
lack
of
complexity
however
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
quite
good
not
bad
just
a
bit
bland
overall
i
am
still
not
sure
about
this
beer
i
had
a
bottle
yesterday
and
enjoyed
it
more
will
have
to
reevalulate
overall
a
nice
take
on
an
epa
and
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
depth
to
the
flavor
o
solid
session
beer
enjoyed
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
schlafly
pale
ale
is
my
go
to
beer
when
i
am
at
a
bar
and
the
choices
on
craft
beer
is
limited
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
at
the
same
time
is
very
refreshing
he
color
is
a
medium
dark
amber
with
a
pale
head
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
is
definitely
a
great
place
for
someone
to
start
who
hasnt
dabbled
in
ales
much
very
nice
beer
easy
drinking
and
the
low
alcohol
makes
it
an
all
night
drinker
overall
i
am
noticing
a
trend
of
malt
forward
brews
even
in
the
styles
which
are
usually
not
as
malt
forward
its
ok
for
this
brew
but
walking
through
the
flight
there
is
little
variability
in
malt
content
d
i
remember
not
being
as
fond
and
finding
this
beer
too
hoppy
years
ago
i
find
this
beer
enjoyable
but
perhaps
a
bit
boring
id
recommend
drinking
it
though
nothing
special
about
this
beer
it
seems
to
have
a
slight
cracker
taste
that
is
off
putting
much
better
pale
ales
on
the
market
it
is
better
than
most
of
the
american
lagers
but
i
am
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
premium
price
that
most
bars
sell
it
at
overall
remarkably
forgettable
if
i
had
not
drank
this
an
hour
ago
i
would
have
forgot
about
it
completely
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
would
drink
it
again
this
style
as
a
whole
just
isnt
very
aggressive
and
this
brew
is
no
different
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
was
an
ale
if
i
was
doing
a
blind
taste
test
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
your
american
lager
drinking
friends
to
transition
over
to
crafts
with
overall
is
makes
a
decent
session
beer
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
overall
4
55
nice
easy
drinking
refreshing
brew
overall
a
nice
product
can
come
from
a
city
with
a
huge
history
in
the
beer
insudtry
and
without
the
ab
on
the
label
had
this
on
tap
at
a
pizza
joint
looked
really
good
outta
the
tap
with
a
two
finger
head
on
top
of
a
hazy
copper
body
unfortunatly
the
smell
and
taste
were
underwelming
it
didnt
smell
bad
it
just
didnt
have
any
aromas
or
flavors
that
made
it
stick
out
from
any
other
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
very
small
bitter
finish
unfortunatly
with
all
the
other
pale
ales
out
there
this
one
is
just
average
it
will
be
good
for
fishing
or
yard
work
but
dont
expect
it
to
blow
your
socks
off
drinkability
this
is
as
fickle
little
creature
i
like
it
it
is
smooth
drinking
and
offers
an
adequate
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
to
satisfy
taste
is
malty
with
hops
and
a
citrus
twist
it
does
not
come
across
as
overly
dry
finish
is
pleasant
with
malt
i
havent
had
that
many
english
beers
since
i
am
not
that
fond
of
them
but
this
one
seems
to
be
well
done
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
do
this
approachable
americanbrewed
ale
packs
a
fair
amount
of
traditional
english
character
without
being
obnoxiously
so
to
the
unaccustomed
palate
it
finds
a
pleasant
versatility
that
is
enhanced
by
its
low
abv
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copperamber
color
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
aromas
of
ripe
fruit
and
fresh
cracked
grain
abound
taste
is
biscuity
toffee
flavors
up
front
followed
by
a
minerally
earthy
hop
middle
and
a
tart
fruit
like
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
for
the
gravity
low
carbonation
overall
an
exceptional
beer
lower
in
alcohol
than
many
pale
ales
but
with
just
as
much
or
more
flavor
tastes
like
a
true
english
pale
ale
which
many
american
interpretations
fall
flat
trying
to
do
smells
of
honey
malt
slight
graininess
and
caramel
taste
is
sweet
caramellike
and
finishes
with
a
peppery
and
slightly
vegetal
hop
zing
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
special
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
m
thin
body
with
decent
carbonation
sticky
in
the
finish
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
way
too
sweet
candy
sweet
sweet
finish
sweet
beginning
minimal
hops
it
is
ok
i
guess
but
not
a
repeat
for
m
pours
a
curious
orangeish
color
not
dissimilar
to
its
label
this
beer
has
a
fairly
complex
aromatic
profile
for
the
style
with
notes
of
candied
sugars
and
a
german
sort
of
maltiness
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
and
lots
of
resonant
aftertastes
the
body
is
quite
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
but
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
medium
carbonation
which
dies
down
soon
after
the
pour
all
up
a
pretty
good
pale
ale
if
you
are
in
the
st
louis
area
but
certainly
not
world
class
could
stand
a
better
balance
between
the
nose
and
the
palate
ones
says
malty
the
other
says
hoppy
and
there
is
some
sort
of
disconnect
there
feels
well
carbonated
and
light
to
medium
in
body
pretty
refreshing
altogether
served
in
a
12
oz
bottle
and
poured
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
initially
produced
a
good
two
finger
head
and
left
plenty
of
lacing
the
appearance
is
a
golden
amber
color
with
moderate
carbonation
that
lasted
until
the
end
this
was
actually
pretty
good
for
a
bottled
pale
ale
it
had
a
slightly
bitter
taste
but
went
down
smooth
and
crisp
12

minimal

not
a
bad

beer
but
nothing
really
great
i
think
the
other
schlafly
beers
are
much
better
very
grainy
almost
musty
in
smell
lots
of
malt
bread
and
a
lot
of
caramel
as
well
had
a
definite
roasted
nuts
kind
of
back
to
it
lots
of
caramel
and
malt
tones
that
were
littered
in
the
back
with
a
tiny
bit
of
english
bittering
hops
nice
sweetness
balancing
it
all
out
very
very
well
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
it
was
a
very
full
bodied
flavor
with
lots
of
earthen
grain
and
malt
tones
this
is
much
less
of
the
ipalight
style
of
apa
than
many
on
the
market
now
much
more
of
a
traditional
english
pale
unfortunately
it
doesnt
rise
to
the
level
of
the
best
of
those
examples
either
meh
given
3
5
scores
across
the
board
the
best
things
about
this
schlafly
offering
are
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
an
overpowering
apa
with
overbearing
hops
but
rather
an
easy
going
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
any
dish
a
mildly
dry
aftertaste
is
all
that
remains
within
minutes
of
pouring
this
beer
into
my
glass
a
worthy
few
minutes
of
my
life
overall
pretty
good
beer
schlafly
always
brings
good
stuff
to
the
bar
while
its
not
a
category
and
its
probably
got
a
little
ways
to
go
for
a
high
b
its
a
solid
effort
that
is
great
for
session
drinking
ill
drink
this
again
on
tap
its
a
big
seller
here
in
stl
the
slick
feel
fluffy
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
and
low
abv
make
it
easy
to
session
but
im
not
doing
that
one
is
enough
if
the
label
said
oktoberfest
i
would
understand
and
accept
it
doesnt
o
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
nice
sessionable
maltforward
pale
no
real
wow
factor
here
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
unless
you
wanted
a
hop
bomb
i
could
get
down
on
a
sixer
of
this
especially
at
schlaflys
good
price
point
schlafly
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
brew
might
not
be
world
class
but
its
damn
fine
extremely
sessionable
and
a
great
example
of
how
a
small
brewery
can
produce
very
solid
and
consistently
delicious
brews
and
do
so
with
style
great
job
again
schlafly
i
will
be
back
again
and
again
o
not
bad
but
nothing
special
reminds
me
of
adjunct
lagers
especially
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
easily
drinkable
it
really
hit
the
spot
after
seven
hours
on
the
road
this
is
the
flagship
brew
from
what
i
hear
and
i
am
not
impressed
worst
of
the
five
schlafly
brews
my
friend
brought
back
from
st
louis
on
tap
throughout
st
louis
during
my
visit
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
light
lacing
throughout
nose
of
caramel
malts
and
citrus
as
well
as
some
floral
hops
smooth
and
clean
mouthfeel
flavor
is
strong
on
malts
and
some
hops
are
there
slightly
bitter
finish
decent
pale
ale
for
a
mainstream
environment
this
pours
a
really
nice
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
medium
white
head
i
already
see
a
lot
of
lacing
and
retention
so
i
am
enjoying
the
appearance
a
lot
the
smell
is
pretty
mild
but
it
smells
like
a
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
crisp
and
bitter
i
have
been
on
a
long
stretch
of
strong
ales
and
ipas
so
the
lack
of
sweetness
is
shocking
yet
refreshing
i
could
almost
say
that
there
is
no
sweetness
at
all
im
not
getting
any
sour
backtalk
from
the
malt
either
this
is
just
a
very
nonoffensive
well
rounded
refreshing
beer
i
particularly
enjoy
the
clean
malt
aftertaste
that
is
balanced
perfectly
with
a
fair
amount
of
hopsexceeding
expectations
this
is
fairly
light
bodied
and
something
that
you
would
want
to
cookout
with
take
to
the
beach
etc
very
good
but
not
quite
there
in
flavor
with
diamond
bear
to
be
an
a
or
as
aromatic
as
their
dry
hopped
pale
ale
id
definitely
buy
if
priced
right
golden
amber
body
with
sticky
puffy
lacing
pale
malt
aromas
light
toasted
grain
with
a
very
mild
hop
element
could
use
more
but
maybe
im
too
conditioned
to
the
uberhoppy
pale
ales
taste
is
pleasant
some
honeyish
malt
with
mild
hops
again
light
feeling
but
with
plenty
of
carbonation
good
for
a
session
get
a
sixpack
for
yourself
overall
an
unusual
apa
i
would
drink
this
again
but
im
not
sure
that
ive
evolved
enough
to
enjoy
this
on
a
regular
basis
also
as
the
bottle
goes
down
the
sweetness
builds
and
it
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
o
easy
drinking
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
taste
is
sweet
initially
then
changing
to
a
smooth
bitterness
at
the
finish
solid
and
mild
this
englishstyle
ale
is
a
quality
session
beer
good
pale
copper
colored
beer
with
frothy
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
ok
lace
the
smell
is
herbal
malty
and
floral
hops
cuts
through
with
herbal
grassy
notes
a
bit
boring
and
watery
with
a
malty
front
and
herbal
background
metallic
notes
but
overall
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
english
style
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
it
produces
a
nice
frothy
head
and
head
retention
is
average
above
average
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
biscuity
this
beer
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
a
perfect
amount
of
malt
there
is
a
slight
finish
of
hops
this
is
an
awesome
english
pale
ale
i
would
put
this
up
against
any
traditional
pale
ale
d
while
not
particularly
memorable
its
a
good
enough
beer
and
at
4
4
its
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
nice
low
abv
helps
make
this
quite
drinkable
well
its
a
true
english
style
pale
ale
boring
seems
to
be
very
bland
not
real
hops
almost
along
the
lines
as
bass
but
not
nearly
as
tasty
at
least
i
dont
think
easy
enough
on
the
palate
that
it
is
a
session
for
sure
good
in
a
pinch
but
not
when
there
are
other
beers
available
i
had
the
pleasure
of
volunteering
at
the
schlafly
tent
at
this
past
years
music
city
brewers
fest
and
i
loved
every
minute
of
it
including
getting
to
sample
this
beer
i
really
hope
their
distribution
in
nashville
continues
to
grow
because
it
took
me
forever
to
find
some
of
this
beer
for
sale
a
really
nice
well
balanced
english
style
pale
my
kind
of
goto
beer
d
surprise
surprise
nice
session
beer
has
enough
flavor
to
tease
your
tastebuds
but
not
overpowering
this
is
not
a
must
try
but
a
fine
english
pale
ale
this
an
fantastic
ale
gateway
beer
solid
flavors
but
low
ibus
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
schlaflys
offerings
in
the
future
drink
the
drink
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
english
style
pale
ale
its
my
favorite
session
beer
and
i
always
keep
some
in
the
house
schlaflys
flagship
got
that
title
for
a
reason

a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
too
complex
a
nice
pale
ale
overallnotes
one
of
those
beers
that
wouldnt
go
on
my
oh
my
list
but
rather
on
my
keep
this
in
mind
one
easy
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
i
think
my
effort
to
review
more
schlafly
brews
has
brought
me
to
appreciate
the
company
a
bit
more
this
is
their
straightforward
beer
and
i
have
no
major
complaints
about
it
well
done
drinkability
started
off
not
really
liking
this
one
but
by
the
middle
of
my
glass
my
opinion
turned
around
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
once
in
a
while
if
it
were
available
to
me
drinkability
while
i
enjoy
a
schlafly
every
now
and
then
this
beer
doesnt
hit
my
taste
buds
with
any
kind
of
pleasure
but
have
many
friends
who
go
to
this
beer
from
the
getgo
forgetting
my
dislike
for
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
pale
ale
as
easily
as
a
budweiser
overall
i
think
this
brew
will
be
a
definite
mainstay
in
my
beer
rotation
it
would
also
be
a
great
transitional
beer
for
those
looking
to
break
away
from
the
typical
american
macro
swill
well
executed
balance
that
makes
for
an
approachable
and
refreshing
craft
beer
i
once
had
this
in
bottles
that
were
too
old
and
it
was
a
shell
of
itself
just
always
follow
the
fresh
beer
rule
for
which
schlafly
provides
bottled
with
love
on
dates
and
youll
be
fine
my
friend
drinkability
this
is
a
smooth
fresh
beer
that
satisfies
thirst
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
sessionable
solid
offering
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
the
nose
is
really
light
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
floral
aspects
but
really
just
some
light
bread
and
grain
the
taste
is
the
same
with
generic
malt
revealing
only
a
tad
bit
of
hoppy
character
in
the
background
mild
feel
with
eversoslight
bitterness
drinks
nice
and
easy
but
is
nowhere
near
the
level
of
their
dryhopped
apa
amber
semi
clouded
one
finger
of
rocky
head
nose
of
fruity
hops
and
malt
sweet
caramelized
malt
up
front
bready
finish
carbonation
just
about
perfect
warming
brings
out
a
faint
grapefruit
and
piney
essence
very
faint
medium
body
quite
good
and
one
could
enjoy
one
or
more
other
than
the
fresh
taste
it
would
be
hard
to
pin
this
as
an
american
brewed
ale
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
session
ales
weve
had
this
year
cheers
to
schlafly
for
this
ale
for
a
proper
food
pairing
go
with
a
heaping
plate
of
bangers
and
mash
orange
amber
with
a
finger
of
cream
colored
foam
that
leaves
some
decent
looking
lace
on
the
glass
faint
toasted
grain
and
just
a
whiff
of
herbal
hops
while
no
off
or
unpleasant
flavors
are
present
there
is
a
gereral
lack
of
flavor
under
hopped
even
for
an
english
pale
ale
and
also
lacking
in
malty
flavor
medium
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
and
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
a
little
more
flavor
concentration
would
help
d
could
drink
these
for
a
couple
at
a
time
nice
with
some
sharp
chedder
and
crackers
still
a
nice
beer
a
bit
too
malty
and
nutty
for
me
taste
borderline
run
of
the
mill
not
offensive
but
lacked
hopping
some
substance
it
isnt
made
with
corn
or
anything
it
seems
but
really
this
is
right
up
there
with
anything
from
sa
pale
or
whatnot
just
isnt
enough
for
an
extreme
beer
drinker
and
theres
so
many
superior
5
pales
out
there
this
one
is
hard
to
justify
at
the
price
use
this
beer
to
bring
people
under
the
craft
tent
if
you
will
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
damn
close
to
a
session
beer
d
very
high
i
have
to
exercise
selfcontrol
whenever
i
have
these
in
my
fridge
because
ill
drink
two
in
one
sitting
without
thinking
twice
id
like
to
find
more
beers
like
this
because
its
one
of
my
favorite
ales
o
nice
pale
ale
definitely
recommend
transparent
amber
color
with
a
whispy
noggin
obviously
english
inspired
woody
and
earthy
tones
in
the
nose
malty
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
transpire
little
to
no
hop
bitterness
for
me
pretty
basic
beer
move
along
not
much
to
see
here
folks
not
a
bad
brew
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
balanced
with
that
distictive
schlafly
yeast
nice
amber
copper
color
and
completely
transparent
forms
a
nice
thick
foam
which
sticks
around
leaving
an
awesome
coat
of
lacing
this
one
really
entices
you
to
take
a
sip
flavor
is
mostly
grainy
malt
with
faint
piney
hops
medium
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
a
solid
english
pale
and
a
nice
offering
from
schlafly
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
still
despite
it
having
some
lots
of
blandness
the
low
alcohol
let
me
have
mutiple
pints
of
this
beer
before
i
called
it
quits
i
have
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
again
nice
session
beer
no
more
no
less
beer
has
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
head
the
aroma
is
fresh
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
light
fresh
it
seems
to
have
a
meduim
body
with
a
crispdry
finish
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
a
great
session
beer
as
it
goes
down
so
easy
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thicker
than
most
pale
ales
not
bad
though
drinkability
was
high
d
i
often
have
several
of
these
without
feeling
it
too
much
i
didnt
realize
until
doing
this
review
that
this
was
a
fairly
low
alcohol
beer
d
i
could
make
this
one
a
staple
brew
i
really
liked
the
balance
and
the
flavor
i
think
the
appearance
is
one
of
the
best
ive
seen
in
a
while
drinkability
4
4abv
this
is
good
session
beer
i
could
see
putting
a
few
of
these
away
during
a
summer
bbq
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
my
first
schlafly
beer
doesnt
exactly
whet
my
appetite
for
more
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
free
sixer
either
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
though
the
brewers
didnt
take
any
risks
here
easy
to
drink
what
i
expected
from
these
brewers
a
good
beer
all
around
this
is
a
great
apa
citrus
hop
aromas
good
head
with
consistent
layering
pale
amber
color
malt
flavor
up
front
with
mellow
hop
bitterness
to
follow
medium
bodied
with
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
clean
finish
with
hops
becoming
more
apparent
i
thought
this
was
more
malty
up
front
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
a
nice
malt
centric
pale
ale
a
nice
break
from
american
hops
overall
this
isnt
a
solid
pale
ale
even
english
it
just
has
too
much
roasted
flavor
especially
in
the
nose
falls
short
in
most
areas
mouthfeel
and
appearance
may
be
its
strongest
suits
for
beer
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
i
wont
trade
for
it
again
or
seek
it
out
with
all
the
other
delicious
brews
out
there
just
average
for
me
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
some
time
now
glad
i
did
i
read
that
one
of
the
alstrom
bros
thinks
this
is
the
perfect
pa
so
thats
why
i
wanted
to
try
it
its
a
solid
beer
for
sure
but
it
lacked
for
me
maybe
its
my
american
palate
but
something
was
just
not
there
to
make
it
a
classic
pa
still
a
solid
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
its
one
that
i
wont
seek
out
again
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
dark
orange
nice
copper
color
with
a
good
one
finger
head
with
ok
retention
leaving
ok
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
hops
they
dont
stand
out
to
much
and
almost
a
sweet
aroma
nothing
sticks
out
to
much
or
anything
the
taste
isnt
bad
not
too
hoppy
but
kind
of
malty
its
not
to
bitter
making
it
almost
kind
of
sweet
i
can
easily
drink
this
one
another
decent
beer
from
schlafly
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
an
easily
sessionable
beer
and
the
flavor
profile
is
fine
which
makes
for
a
decent
little
beer
d
minimal
alcohol
appearance
and
good
tasting
makes
it
very
drinkable
d
my
overall
impression
of
this
is
decent
the
flavors
are
nice
but
certainly
on
the
tame
side
this
strikes
me
as
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
just
getting
their
feet
or
palates
wet
with
fuller
flavored
brews
i
found
the
appearance
inviting
the
flavor
about
average
and
the
mouthfeel
a
tad
watery
the
mildness
of
the
abv
and
overall
flavor
would
make
it
easy
for
some
to
throw
back
a
few
i
would
have
like
it
more
if
it
would
have
had
a
bit
more
bitterness
just
an
o
k
beer
for
me
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
started
on
craft
beer
oh
those
many
years
ago
back
in
college
i
was
totally
against
the
man
so
i
refused
to
drink
beer
from
giant
corporations
schlafly
was
the
only
game
in
town
other
than
sam
adams
in
1992
while
i
have
come
to
learn
that
this
is
a
pretty
typical
pale
ale
it
will
always
ranks
as
one
of
my
favorites
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
i
got
too
terribly
excited
about
its
a
decent
alternative
to
run
of
the
mill
restaurant
menu
beers
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
color
to
it
at
first
pour
there
is
a
decent
white
one
finger
foamy
head
but
it
very
quickly
fades
and
there
is
very
little
lacing
nose
is
of
strong
malts
and
then
floral
hops
not
overpowering
on
either
and
the
nose
was
slightly
muted
taste
is
slightly
bready
but
decently
balanced
between
the
malts
and
floral
hops
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
mouthfeel
is
more
of
a
medium
body
and
a
decent
crisp
finish
to
it
this
is
a
decent
beer
where
nothing
stood
out
i
may
not
pick
it
up
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away

its

and
would
be
a
good
choice
as
a
session

i
think
its
another
solid
offering
from
schlafly
id
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future

leaves
except
around
the
edges

it

nicely
the
smell

of

a

i
was
suprised
in
how
sweet
the
aftertaste
was
with
this

nice
caramel
aftertaste
during
the
drink
there
is
some
well
balanced
bitterness
from
the
hops
while
some
malt
flavor
this
beer
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
carbonation
a
nice
ale
that
i
will
buy
again
a
fairly
decent
session
beer
but
not
incredibly
flavorful
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
mainly
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
english
pale
ale
has
a
slightly
crisp
mouth
feel
along
with
low
carbonation
it
has
a
noticeably
smooth
mouth
feel
tastes
of
sweet
malts
some
earthy
characteristic
and
a
slight
malt
background
overall
one
of
the
smoothest
english
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
a
little
light
on
the
hops
for
my
taste
but
still
worth
a
try
not
too
lively
on
the
palate
as
far
as
carbonation
goes
but
its
pretty
traditional
in
that
way
maybe
smooth
and
caramely
would
probably
make
for
a
nice
pairing
with
well
made
fish
n
chips
tastes
more
sweet
than
hoppy
in
my
mind
i
have
come
up
with
an
american
pale
ale
taste
spectrum
on
one
end
you
have
budweiser
american
ale
malty
with
some
light
hop
flavor
and
on
the
other
end
you
have
sierra
nevada
puckering
oily
hoppiness
this
one
is
situated
firmly
on
the
bud
american
side
nice
pleasant
sweet
taste
very
little
bitterness
pedestrian
but
drinkable
not
bad
but
nothing
mind
blowingly
complex
either
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
english
pale
while
i
cant
say
i
normally
seek
out
this
style
i
do
appreciate
it
on
its
own
merits
i
think
schlaflys
has
done
a
very
respectable
job
with
this
one
nice
session
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
brown
color
body
with
a
foamy
white
cloudy
head
somewhat
lasting
has
a
malty
aroma
some
nuttiness
some
graininess
too
has
a
malty
nutty
taste
somewhat
creamy
dusty
a
taste
of
light
fruit
an
english
malty
taste
better
on
tap
fresher
tasting
soft
mouthfeel
more
hoppy
overall
thanks
to
vancer
for
this
kind
hook
up
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
it
isnt
extreme
or
aggressive
some
times
that
is
good
i
have
liked
everything
i
have
ever
had
from
schlafly
and
this
is
no
exception
dokay
session
beer
very
good
rep
of
an
english
bitter
more
of
a
blonde
than
a
pale
hopefully
i
can
see
what
else
schlalfly
has
to
offer
d
this
is
has
been
a
goto
beer
for
me
for
a
while
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
i
havent
reviewed
it
yet
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
has
accompanied
me
on
many
of
my
nights
on
the
town
in
st
louis
d
seems
pretty
quaffable
to
me
not
much
wrong
with
this
one
nothing
outstanding
either
would
go
for
it
in
a
pinch
serving
type
bottle
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
goldenamber
color
with
a
dense
twofinger
head
that
crackles
like
rice
crispies
and
a
torrent
of
bubbles
rising
constantly
from
the
depths
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
slightly
sweet
grainy
malt
and
a
light
kiss
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
grainy
malt
flavor
dominating
the
hops
are
there
to
balance
and
add
a
little
flavor
but
are
not
the
centerpiece
of
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
pillowy
carbonation
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
definitely
beats
any
bmc
beer
but
isnt
anything
outstanding
either
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pale
ale
with
good
character
and
a
hop
quality
that
is
deceptively
subtle
in
aroma
and
nicely
proportioned
in
taste
cheers
dnotes
overall
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
an
english
pale
ale
i
had
to
remind
myself
while
reviewing
it
that
it
is
an
english
pale
as
opposed
to
american
pale
with
the
former
typically
having
more
balance
and
less
assertive
hop
bitterness
that
said
this
beer
is
still
just
too
weak
to
get
a
thumbs
up
from
me
as
all
flavors
seem
too
mild
and
the
finish
too
weak
a
bit
more
just
all
around
body
malt
and
hops
would
do
wonders
for
this
decent
brew
pretty
much
a
why
even
bother
pale
ale
not
a
bad
brew
good
session
beer
or
good
for
anytime
drinkin
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
shines
super
user
friendly
taste
not
one
thing
harsh
about
this
highly
recommended
sampled
at
the
tap
room
in
july
of
08
weak
head
of
white
bubbles
did
not
last
long
and
the
beer
itself
was
a
light
amber
color
leaning
towards
the
gold
side
some
good
lacing
but
overall
not
a
great
looking
beer
aromas
are
soft
bready
malt
maple
syrup
and
some
hops
the
flavors
were
much
better
defined
however
clear
hoppiness
roasted
malt
and
yeast
ends
on
a
bitter
finish
with
the
dry
hops
again
making
their
presence
known
nothing
thrilling
medium
body
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
especially
as
it
warms
up
ok
but
not
much
better
than
that
d
great
for
a
session
beer
or
sipping
on
a
few
i
wouldnt
drink
this
if
there
were
other
decent
options
d
it
was
a
pleasant
enough
experience
if
not
terribly
inspiring
d
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
however
if
it
were
the
only
option
available
i
could
down
quite
a
few
of
these
in
all
its
a
mild
improvement
over
readily
available
american
massbrews
i
wont
drink
this
regularly
d
a
nice
ale
pretty
highly
drinkable
not
as
bitter
as
some
pale
ales
d
i
could
drink
more
than
one
but
i
would
probably
pick
something
else
instead

the
aroma

a
a
dry
selling

with
some
notes

stale
bread
and
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
mild
bready

a
well
balanced
and
muted

perfect
for
a

rounds
at

for

and
i
hope
you
enjoy
the
tasty
pnw
treats
a
decent
offering
from
the
only
good
brewery
in

nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
if
you
are
in
the
area
try
some
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
brew
but
not
tons
going
on
here
its
pleasant
but
not
memorable
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
share
with
a

who
is
hooked
on

but
wants
to
try
something
new
baby
steps
d
very
easy
drinking
and
very

complex
if
just
a

nothing
complex
here
just
an

quaffable
ale
and
at

abv
per
the
website
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
several
during

very
clean
this
is

nice

beer
for
the

at

deliciously
balanced
pale
ale
with
medium
proportions

board

with
a
richly
malty
sweet
character
reminescent
of
oktoberfest
maltiness
countered
with
a
moderate
hop
orange
rinds
and
pine
but
does
not
dominate
the
beer
like
many
pale
ales
can
the
appearance
is
a
bright
hue
stuck
between
copper
and
amber
a
froathy

rose
above
the
beverage
and
settled
nicely
at

then
steadied
for
the
duration
with
some

very
malty
maybe
too
much
so
giving
up
a
lot
of
toasted
breads
and
raw
dough
with
an
underlying
caramel
sweetness
the
hops
shows
much
pine
character
but
with
spicy
undertones
of
lemongrass
oranges
and
herbal
tealike
flavors
moderate
body
prevails
at
times
giving
too
much
thickness
and
others
thinning
just
enough
to
increase
the
drinkability
finishes
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
the
herbal
notes
linger
as
well
a
solid
beer
with
less
agressiveness
than
normally
expected
basically
an
average
beer
but
it
does
go
down
easily
clear
copper
body
with
golden
edges
and
a
cm
of
lacy
thick
dirty
white
head
toasted
malts
caramely
fruits
and
floral
herbal
hops
on
the
nose
grainy
slightly
astringent
taste
up
front
shallow
toffee
and
apple
malt
herbal
slightly
minty
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
moderate
body
with
gentle
rolling
carbonation
not
bad
schlafly
pale
ale
is
probably
a
decent
seller
but
i
dont
taste
a
whole
lot
to
get
excited
about
i
hope
dryhopped
american
apa
is
brewed
yearround
because
id
choose
that
one
over
this
one
ten
times
out
of
ten
it
doesnt
matter
though
until
these
guys
finally
get
around
to
distributing
their
beer
up
this
way
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
united
we
stand
pint
glass
that
i
stole
from
a
bar
poured
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
nice
inch
head
that
stayed
with
the
beer
all
the
beer
left
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
mild
citrusy
hops
with
almost
a
wet
cardboard
after
nose
taste
is
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
profile
in
the
finish
very
mild
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
very
a
drinkable
pale
ale
d
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
really
only
probably
an
average
brew
given
the
many
other
choices
available
again
not
awful
but
not
worth
going
out
of
ones
way
to
grab
draught
at
the
lambert
st
louis
airport
location
pours
a
lightly
hazed
goldenorange
color
with
a
thin
and
dense
ivory
colored
head
that
stays
for
a
bit
stringy
lacing
the
aroma
has
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
medium
smooth
body
with
a
straightforward
combination
of
nutty
malt
hops
and
citrus
flavors
the
finish
is
on
the
sweet
malty
side
with
a
slightly
bitter
hops
aftertaste
fairly
nondescript
epa
all
around
but
very
welcome
in
an
airport
purchased
from
beergeek
biz
the
ale
pours
with
a
1
head
that
slowly
dissipates
but
laces
to
the
pint
glass
mild
toasty
nose
palate
has
a
complex
malty
flavor
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
brief
sweetish
aftertaste
overall
impression
was
very
favorable
schlafly
advertised
a
britishstyle
ale
and
they
delivered
this
may
be
too
mild
for
some
but
it
is
a
nice
change
up
from
the
west
coast
ales
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
use
as
an
introduction
into
craft
brews
drinkability
good
marks
for
this
st
louismade
beer
the
label
indicates
that
this
beer
is
made
as
a
traditional
british
pale
ale
i
think
theyre
about
right
on
this
one
and
i
throroughly
enjoyed
the
sample
i
picked
a
sixer
of
this
up
site
unseen
on
a
recent
travel
out
of
state
i
seemed
to
have
made
a
good
selection
a
nice
english
style
pale
ale
no
major
flaws
a
bit
lacking
in
mouthfeel
but
certainly
forgiven
as
it
can
be
a
real
session
beer
i
continue
to
be
impressed
by
the
improving
quality
of
this
brewerys
bottled
product
drinks
alright
nothing
really
stands
out
here
but
i
could
drink
a
few
in
a
pinch
even
considering
that
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
a
lighter
english
pale
ale
compared
to
the
overhopped
american
version
this
beer
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
which
is
forecasted
in
the
barely
darker
than
straw
gold
little
head
that
disappeared
quickly
for
me
the
least
appealing
part
is
the
smell
is
a
non
appealing
cream
corn
smell
with
little
malt
and
no
noticable
hops
character
drinks
like
a
slight
beefed
up
macro
thats
for
an
audience
that
i
dont
believe
im
a
part
of
from
the
real
brewery
in
stl
their
most
popular
and
best
selling
beer
the
schlafly
pale
ale
pours
a
red
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
disappears
quick
smells
good
with
slightly
of
citrus
and
more
of
a
malty
yummy
deliciousness
tastes
nice
and
malty
with
some
hopness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
but
still
full
and
good
drinkability
is
great
it
is
an
awesome
beer
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
if
youre
in
the
midwest
you
gotta
get
some
a
medium
copper
color
with
an
off
white
colored
head
that
laces
slowly
down
the
glass
a
slight
aroma
of
roasted
barley
followed
by
bready
fragrance
and
ending
with
citrus
scents
a
mild
malt
flavor
that
gradually
blends
with
a
hop
bitterness
that
is
not
to
overbearing
a
medium
bodied
feel
that
thins
to
an
almost
watery
texture
at
the
back
of
the
palate
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
the
blend
of
malt
and
hops
is
well
done
the
only
let
down
is
the
feel
but
overall
a
good
beer
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
at
all
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
light
amber
color
with
medium
offwhite
head
that
lingered
well
and
left
okay
lacing
aroma
was
a
pleasant
hoppyctirus
with
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
bland
but
the
flavor
followed
along
the
citrusy
sweet
path
all
leading
to
a
short
but
pleasant
finish
drinkability
could
do
two
in
a
night
drinkability
a
good
session
beer
or
good
crossover
beer
but
kind
of
middling
d
this
is
a
pretty
descent
pale
ale
nothing
special
but
still
very
drinkable
soft
carbonation
and
ample
body
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drinbk
i
enjoyed
this
one
because
of
the
simplicity
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yelloworange
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
foamy
white
head
nice
littles
islands
and
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
hops
citrus
and
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
touch
of
citrus
medium
body
very
drinkable
another
nice
brew
from
schlafly
kind
of
thin
mouthfeel
but
definitely
sessionable
this
beer
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
an
easy
drinker
and
very
clean
mouthfeel
was
mildly
zesty
with
a
thin
to
medium
body
overall
a
nice
beer
12
oz
bottle
a
solid
oranged
copper
colored
beerdepartsthe
bottle
a
finger
of
stark
white
head
sits
atop
the
beer
falling
quickly
to
a
patchy
island
a
few
stray
bubbles
are
seen
boiling
up
to
the
top
and
clarity
is
moderate
the
aroma
is
lightly
earthy
with
a
strong
toasty
english
malt
character
that
is
really
the
dominant
character
of
the
smell
the
flavor
is
big
in
toasted
maltyness
with
a
more
mild
earthy
and
lighly
peppery
and
spicey
hop
character
that
adds
a
nice
balance
a
distant
caramel
sweetness
is
present
as
well
that
really
rounds
the
flavor
out
it
is
mild
but
still
flavorful
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
in
there
that
breaks
things
up
nicely
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
from
both
malt
and
hop
but
does
not
hit
me
too
strong
either
way
this
is
one
that
i
would
definately
keep
around
if
i
could
find
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
smell
of
carmel
and
floral
hops
taste
is
initially
malty
followed
by
some
nice
hops
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
would
like
a
little
more
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
from
schlafly
it
was
always
a
go
to
beer
before
the
apa
came
easlily
available
good
effort
though
a
nice
solid
pale
ale
with
some
english
leanings
but
nothing
stodgy
poured
an
attractive
amber
some
moderate
sweetness
up
front
with
a
bit
of
carmel
malt
hops
bittering
didnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
but
was
nicely
flavorful
nonetheless
this
is
a
pale
ale
at
home
at
the
table
with
dinner
upon
reading
other
reviews
i
fear
that
i
may
have
gotten
a
stinker
it
states
on
the
bottle
that
it
was
brewed
with
love
on
sept
6
2006
and
it
is
now
october
20th
so
age
isnt
an
issue
i
got
his
off
of
a
mixasix
rack
maybe
a
bad
batch
taste
was
good
reminded
me
a
lot
of
an
excellent
british
pale
this
beer
is
pretty
mellow
yet
quite
drinkable
has
a
great
malty
backbone
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
to
make
it
interesting
looking
forward
to
trying
the
remainder
of
my
sixer
pours
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
doesnt
persist
long
spotty
lacing
in
the
pint
nose
is
caramel
malts
and
flowery
hops
smells
wellbalanced
palate
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
the
hops
assert
themselves
and
save
this
from
being
overly
malty
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
medium
and
there
seems
to
be
barely
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
a
decent
english
style
pale
ale
d
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
i
would
not
have
described
this
as
a
pale
ale
if
i
didnt
say
it
on
the
menu
smooth
and
interesting
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
bit
more
flavor
12

smell
seems
off
for

almost

its

yeasty
taste
is
a
very
very
mild
hops
more
sour

there
is

a
bready

almost
to
the
point

being

despite
this
not
working
very
well
as

i
can
see
this
as

for
working
in

i
may
grab
some
after
mowing
6
69
6pack
one
of
my
favorites
yes
it
is
a
bit
inconsistent
but
when
they
nail
it
schlafly
really
nails
it
this
is
hoppy
yet
balanced
and
i
could
drink
every
day
if
i
could
afford
it
absolutely
delicious
especially
when
on
tap
it
is
a
wonder
to
enjoy
rerate
after
having
this
many
times
and
many
many
other
beers
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
good
training
wheels
beer
and
still
a
solid
session
ale
but
not
as
great
as
id
remembered
it
they
say
every
brewer
makes
a
pale
ale
this
example
goes
to
show
that
even
good
brewers
can
and
do
make
mediocre
pale
ales
from
time
to
time
this
is
drinkable
but
not
distinctive
continuing
my
love
and
confusion
relationship
with
schlafly
that
might
only
be
resolved
when
i
travel
cross
state
to
visit
her
family
pours
clear
copper
under
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
but
surely
to
thick
film
and
collar
leaving
a
few
decent
strands
of
lace
nice
grain
and
spice
nose
with
a
rye
bread
note
to
it
the
mouth
is
reasonably
heavy
but
very
well
carbonated
mild
flavors
here
nothing
jumps
out
with
a
good
smooth
mix
of
semisweet
malt
and
espresso
bitter
hops
the
hops
particularly
emerge
as
it
warms
theres
a
bite
in
the
finish
but
it
is
very
quick
fading
immediately
to
a
shadow
of
coffee
dryness
i
didnt
like
the
first
couple
of
sips
but
grew
to
enjoy
it
immensely
on
a
side
not
i
have
converted
a
budmilcoors
drinker
with
this
beer
he
used
to
be
a
nonbeliever
until
i
gave
him
one
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
and
has
a
sudsy
head
it
has
more
hops
presence
than
a
lager
but
less
than
a
regular
ale
aletype
ale
in
fact
its
a
good
midstep
to
the
austere
british
ales
that
nonbeerdrinkers
usually
shy
away
from
my
theory
is
that
a
person
needs
to
learn
to
enjoy
a
brew
such
as
this
and
then
the
leap
to
strong
ale
wont
be
so
great
i
didnt
have
a
problem
with
that
type
of
jump
but
im
an
an
oddball
the
drinkability
is
superb
for
a
brew
that
has
a
relatively
heavy
mouthfeel
aparently
schlafly
is
the
only
brew
to
be
served
in
busch
stadium
aside
from
anheiserbusch
beers
st
louis
mo
this
brew
really
made
me
a
believer
in
the
midwest
brew
selection
hopefully
i
can
get
this
stuff
in
jersey
its
about
this
same
price
as
yuengling
but
at
many
times
the
quality
nothing
to
rave
about
here
just
a
decent
drinkable
pale
ale
ill
be
looking
for
this
on
the
shelf
of
my
home
town
beer
store
this
beer
came
to
me
a
bronze
color
with
orange
around
the
sides
medium
head
held
for
a
bit
aroma
was
citrusy
with
slight
honey
characteristics
the
flavors
on
the
tongue
were
sweeter
in
the
honey
dept
citrus
was
low
but
a
new
toasted
malt
character
came
in
finish
was
sweet
too
sweet
and
held
this
beer
was
simply
too
sweet
for
my
liking
with
nothing
to
balance
i
liked
it
a
lot
more
at
first
sip
than
when
i
finished
my
pint
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
pours
clear
orange
into
the
glass
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
dissipates
but
leaves
a
lacing
that
hangs
on
for
dear
life
some
coarse
smell
of
hops
a
little
citrus
a
little
toasty
smell
taste
is
nice
and
mildly
hoppy
again
a
little
citrus
with
a
touch
of
coarseness
and
a
tiny
bit
of
breadiness
underneath
feels
medium
full
in
the
mouth
with
typical
carbonation
drinks
easily
although
not
the
highest
on
my
list
for
pale
ales
it
is
easy
to
have
quite
a
few
in
a
session
not
a
fan
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
good
overall
brew
note
i
tried
this
ontap
around
st
louis
the
nose
was
no
better
the
palate
was
improved
but
the
mouthfeel
was
too
carbonated
i
didnt
take
proper
notes
on
these
versions
so
this
is
the
best
i
can
do
finally
got
to
sample
a
cask
beer
at
the
taproom
much
different
that
from
the
bottle
still
poured
an
amberruby
with
lite
head
the
taste
compared
to
the
bottle
version
was
much
more
citus
milder
on
the
hops
carbonation
next
to
nothing

almost
to
the
point
that
it
was
flat
cellar
temperature
lead
to
a
smooth
pull
through
the
pint
will
need
a
few
more
the
next
time
at
taproom
for
further
review
this
pale
ale
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
very
white
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
mildly
malt
with
a
good
dose
of
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
hoppiness
overall
a
mild
but
balanced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
and
relatively
clean
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
this
was
a
very
nice
english
pale
ale
from
cask
this
beer
was
much
better
from
a
cask
than
i
recall
it
ontap
their
flagship
and
widely
marketed
pale
ale
pours
a
dark
bronze
hue
with
a
thin
purewhite
head
sheets
of
lacing
to
race
an
eyebrow
over
a
very
faint
citrushops
combined
aroma
smooth
somewhat
creamy
a
delicate
amount
of
hops
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
some
breadymalt
flavorings
in
the
body
bordering
on
a
medium
bodied
beverage
this
is
a
decent
to
above
average
pale
ale
yet
it
is
incredibly
smooth
session
with
a
big
s
and
on
the
top
shelf
of
my
fridge
year
round
12oz
bottle
this
pours
a
very
clear
amber
color
it
has
a
bit
of
an
offwhite
head
that
does
not
linger
long
some
lacing
a
bit
of
hops
to
the
nose
pleasant
but
not
strong
a
bit
of
a
subtle
hop

with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness

i

up
passing
through
st

and
im
glad
i
did
its
a
good
looking
brew
poured
from
its
rusty
orange

its
clear

presents
a

mostly
capped
off
the
sweet
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
also
the
carmel
malt
but
balanced
nice
with
a
drying
hop
finish
a
good
mouthfeel
from
a
good
balanced
brew
making
drinkability
easy
id
buy
again
while
looking
at
other
offerings
from
this
brewer
beer
had
a
light
feel
and
mouthfeel
while
not
a
world
class
pale
ale
it
is
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
quite
attractive
on
the
pour
the
midamber
color
is
clear
and
joined
by
a
voluminous
offwhite
to
light
tan
head
the
head
is
thick
and
frothy
and
hangs
about
for
too
short
a
bit
of
time
otherwise
the
marks
would
be
even
higher
decent
lacing
initially
fading
near
the
end
very
caramel
malt
aroma
is
joined
by
bready
sweetness
on
the
palate
nice
hop
finish
cuts
the
sweetness
in
the
back
and
imparts
a
nice
dryness
good
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
brew
good
presentation
id
buy
again
when
in
st
louis
on
the
palate
this
ale
offers
a
sweet
bready
taste
that
mingles
well
with
the
hop
fruitiness
serve
this
one
at
room
temp
or
slightly
chilled
colder
temps
suppress
the
fresh
bready
notes
an
focus
the
hops
definitely
an
english
style
pale
ale
yellowish
gold
in
colo
rleans
on
the

more
than
the
hops
very
drinkable
a
tich
thin
a
bready
maltiness
with
more
or
a
very
soft
herbal
hop
flavor
a
good
session
beer
but
not
a
remarkable
beer
solid
not
great
drinkability
while
its
an
easy
drinking
brew
the
balance
problems
really
throw
the
flavor
profile
off
this
beer
is
far
better
on
draft
and
is
fantastic
from
the
handpump
pours
out
a
deep
copper
color
the
slight
head
stays
and
even
leaves
a
bit
of
festive
lace
nice
light
malty
aromas
of
caramel
paired
with
some
spicy
aromatic
hops
very
inviting
medium
body
a
bit
buttery
with
the
light
biscuity
malts
dominating
the
flavor
profile
with
a
bit
of
light
gentle
hop
bitterness
an
easy
drinking
nice
tasting
english
pale
ale
a
bit
thin
and
unassuming
for
my
tastes
but
quite
drinkable
this
is
an
interesting
pale
orange
gold
color
with
a
persisting
thin
head
and
light
hop
spice
aroma
an
admirable
malt
base
is
balanced
by
an
aggressive
spicy

the

in
increasingly
spicy

nose
is
caramel
malt
perhaps
a
hint
of
diacetyl
butter
aroma
with
some
english
hop
aroma
again
it
seems
like
fuggle
to
me
palate
is
too
carbonated
which
strips
some
of
the
flavor
there
is
a
good
maltiness
but
it
lists
a
bit
too
much
to
the
caramel
side
of
the
spectrum
for
my
the
hop
bitterness
is
present
but
not
overt
decent
length
and
fine
with
food
my
least
favorite
expression
of
this
beer
caskconditioned
wins
for
me
followed
by
keg
but
a
very
welcome
sight
at
a
wedding
this
weekend
looks
good
but
tastes
like
cardboard
and
old
malt
i
like
it
except
the
aftertaste
could
be
slightly
better
i
was
not
overly
impressed
in
fact
it
seemed
to
personify
mediocrity
in
every
way
i
have
a
feeling
this
bottle
might
be
quite
old
but
no
way
to
know
o
pretty
good
english
style
cheers
overall
this
is
a
a
great
english
style
pale
ale
very
crisp
great
aroma
and
flavor
and
mouth
presence
o
i
never
by
this
only
because
i
assumed
it
would
be
blah
its
actually
very
good
strikes
a
balance
between
esb
and
something
more
refreshing
and
crisp
not
a
bad
shelf
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
overall
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
traditional
pale
ale
and
this
is
one
would
recommend
to
anyone
good
interesting
take
on
an
english
ale
with
hops
tuned
up
to
the
american
way
almost
an
english
ipa
if
you
dig
the
style
definitely
it
is
worth
trying
great
option
for
american
exexpats
of
the
old
world
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoy
it
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
pale
ales
pretty
good
at
of
a
bottle
but
far
better
out
of
a
snifter
glass
in
fact
remarkably
better
all
qualities
out
of
the
bottle
slightly
chilled
are
too
sweet
and
too
powerful
the
glass
seems
to
free
the
ale
of
its
hyper
sweet
aroma
and
taste
and
makes
the
beer
rather
enjoyable
i
suggest
serving
it
in
the
mid
40s
f
and
eating
peanuts
or
pretzels
with
the
drink
o
biases
against
crystal
malt
and
englishstyle
pale
ales
aside
this
one
does
the
job
well
its
richer
than
its
low
abv
would
suggest
too
the
old
adage
its
not
you
its
me
is
appropriate
for
this
one
still
i
can
imagine
this
one
being
rocksolid
on
cask
pours
a
malty
amberlight
caramel
in
color
theres
a
subdued
hop
almost
like
a
stronger
stalebeer
aroma
mixed
with
an
offputting
dankskunky
note
lingering
around
the
flavor
has
a
light
bitterness
that
tapers
into
a
harsh
flat
taste
it
leaves
an
aftertaste
that
is
not
welcome
i
liken
this
flavor
to
what
happens
when
you
overcook
and
slightly
burn
something
but
end
up
making
a
dish
with
it
all
the
sameits
not
quite
enough
to
make
you
not
want
it
but
its
not
something
youre
going
to
want
to
have
again
either
oh
well
update

hadnt
gotten
around
to
rereviewing
this
before
now
so
much
good
beer
so
little
digestive
capacity
bought
another
single
though
and
had
it
tonight
with
dinner
not
nearly
as
crazy
about
it
as
i
was
its
good
and
still
fruitier
than
most
pales
and
still
far
less
hoppy
than
many
american
ones
but
i
did
not
find
it
especially
distinguished
as
tasty
and
wonderful
or
as
rich
as
before
thus
downgrading
my
very
high
previous
rating
from
4
55
overall
to
3
75
my
reviewing
software
here
changed
a
few
weeks
ago
i
am
no
longer
able
to
rate
the
five
appearancesmell
tastemouthfeeloverall
separately
so
i
have
to
go
with
this
ill
probably
buy
more
and
rereview
again
since
the
difference
between
first
and
second
tastings
was
so
inexplicably
enormous
overall
pretty
good
good
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
particularly
noteworthy
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
honeycopper
coloring
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
head
on
the
surface
aromas
of
rich
tangy
sweetness
with
toffee
honey
and
nut
making
up
the
bulk
of
the
nose
hints
of
roast
in
there
as
well
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
with
a
roasted
overtone
biscuit
backbone
with
toffee
overlays
and
a
hops
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
palate
light
and
smooth
in
mouth
with
a
semisweet
and
bitter
aftertaste
clean
finish
with
a
subtle
tangy
sweet
linger
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
overpowering
despite
some
heavier
flavor
profiles
o
its
a
very
wellmade
english
style
pale
ale
put
it
on
your
short
list
if
youre
into
the
style
it
tends
to
get
overlooked
in
these
parts
and
im
not
sure
why
given
the
success
of
similar
beers
like
whales
tale
maybe
the
brand
just
needs
a
little
more
visibility
then
again
gearys
does
seem
to
be
a
pretty
polarizing
brewery
as
a
whole
amber
color
with
ample
head
gorgeous
lacing
and
good
carbonation
the
smell
is
nothing
short
of
the
glorious
ale
fruitiness
they
promise
in
the
notes
the
yeast
and
hops
combine
to
give
character
to
classic
malty
ale
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
medicinal
and
bitter
due
to
some
of
those
west
coast
hops
added
in
but
overall
this
is
much
closer
kindred
to
a
true
traditional
english
style
than
any
west
coast
apa
ive
had
gearys
wins
exceptionally
high
points
for
knowing
exactly
what
theyre
doing
then
doing
it
this
is
how
solid
craftsmanship
tastes
d
a
pretty
average
style
english
pale
all
the
right
notes
here
nothing
to
stand
outish
overall
some
of
the
flavor
choices
in
this
beer
just
dont
suit
my
palate
however
i
think
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
very
balanced
flavor
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
that
i
have
enjoyed
over
the
years
especially
up
in
maine
will
be
drinking
more
in
the
future
too
gearys
pale
ale
is
a
very
clear
very
sparkling
amber
ale
with
a
smooth
dense
yellowish
cream
that
leaves
outstanding
lacing
the
aroma
is
grainy
papery
medicinal
and
herbal
kind
of
like
an
irish
ale
its
pretty
light
bodied
smooth
and
lively
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
i
taste
light
toasty
malt
the
herbal
hops
are
lightly
bitter
it
tastes
like
it
smells
with
some
added
fruitiness
its
similar
to
an
irish
red
and
makes
for
an
acceptable
session
ale
o
this
was
a
good
beer
simple
and
tasty
o
not
my
style
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
happily
purchased
while
vacationing
in
maine
drinks
around
5

abv
great
dry
hops
flavor
and
pale
ale
personality
esp
if
youre
looking
for
one
in
the
lowerabv
range
which
i
sometimes
am
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
which
is
an
apa
not
english
and
the
aroma
is
not
as
rich
but
a
great
american
beer
nonetheless
great
pic
of
a
lobster
on
the
label
and
a
great
regional
beer
the
likes
of
which
seem
to
be
dwindling
every
year
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
especially
given
its
low
alcohol
content
overall
a
nice
beer
good
taste
and
pretty
well
balanced
o
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
overall
i
like
this
one
but
not
enough
to
snag
it
off
a
shelf
if
i
ever
saw
it
english
pale
ales
arent
necessarily
my
favorite
though
this
one
stays
true
to
the
style
o
this
is
a
very
solid
english
pale
ale
that
is
extremely
enjoyable
any
time
of
the
year
easy
to
drink
too
which
makes
this
a
solid
brew
all
around
good
beer
simple
and
tasty
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
tan
head
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
hints
of
caramel
the
flavor
if
of
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
bold
hop
bitterness
that
lasts
through
the
bitter
aftertaste
its
got
a
medium
mouthfeel
gearys
pale
ale
is
barely
drinkable
the
hops
just
overpower
it
not
recommended
d
overall
very
easy
to
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
with
friends
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
pales
but
dont
expect
an
american
pale
cheers
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
lighter
then
expected
and
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
it
goes
down
well
and
have
a
good
aftertaste
that
does
not
linger
it

i
really
liked
the
flavours
in
this
more
bitterness
than
an
english
pale
ale
but
with
a
lot
of
the
character
hmm
i
wonder
if
this
beer
would
go
well
with
lobster
oh
well
i
only
have
a
burger
itll
haveta
do
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
the
starkly
simple
dichotomy
of
sweet
caramel
and
flowery
hops
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
flowers
and
caramel
are
now
joined
by
a
light
orange
complete
with
bitterness
from
the
peel
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
dry
almost
grainy
feel
overall
a
nice
pale
nothing
overtly
exciting
but
a
very
drinkable
lil
brew
db
the
flavors
come
together
pretty
well
and
make
this
one
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
darker
fruit
malt
than
i
expected
refreshing
and
goes
down
smooth
i
found
this
at
small
rural
store
in
washington
county
maine
i
paired
it
with
a
spicy
chili
it
is
now
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
with
spicy
food
it
had
a
great
smooth
head
that
stayed
for
a
while
the
color
was
medium
amber
good
for
this
type
excellent
hop
character
it
was
really
good
i
will
keep
some
on
hand
from
now
on
d
could
easily
throw
a
few
of
these
back
but
there
is
nothing
distinct
enough
about
this
beer
to
separate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
run
of
the
mills
apas
it
is
definitely
better
than
the
crap
that
the
major
brewing
companies
produce
but
nothing
to
brag
home
about
drink
once
again
i
may
be
drinking
and
old
batch
but
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
and
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
i
would
probably
buy
one
or
two
if
i
visited
maine
dont
really
like
the
taste
but
the
great
mouthfeel
makes
it
all
good
drinkability
since
this
is
so
english
in
character
it
is
hard
to
think
of
this
as
an
apa
though
it
may
be
slightly
hoppier
in
style
decent
if
you
are
a
ringwood
fan
which
i
am
not
poured
with
a
massive
head
almost
more
of
the
laundry
soap
variety
hazy
brown
color
fairly
average
across
the
spectrum
of
smell
taste
mouthfeel
it
had
a
bitter
after
taste
which
to
me
tasted
more
like
cheap
hops
than
by
deliberate
design
drinkable
but
to
me
this
is
still
just
cheap
beer
a
damn
good
apa
its
nothing
ground
breaking
but
whats
wrong
with
that
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
copperamber
with
three
fingers
of
white
great
head
retention
and
great
lacing
decent
visible
carbonation
smelled
of
pear
apple
and
biscuit
the
taste
was
very
macintosh
apple
trace
amounts
of
pear
and
not
very
dry
on
the
finish
less
carbonation
than
expected
yet
mediumbodied
decent
pale
ale
but
my
expectations
were
pretty
high
going
into
this
easy
drinker
and
a
good
unique
take
on
the
style
shockingly
astringent
as
it
hits
the
tongue
plenty
of
bitterness
but
without
any
real
hop
flavor
other
than
a
touch
of
leafiness
a
hint
of
nuttiness
in
the
finish
dry
as
hell
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
sweetness
some
noticeable
oxidation
really
an
odd
beer
not
a
lot
to
recommend
here
ordered
a
bottle
at
the
rattlesnake
on
boylston
st
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
rust
colored
body
perfect
sized
white
head
smell
was
hoppy
and
spicy
taste
was
quite
agreeable
there
was
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
also
a
nice
malt
backbone
an
excellent
counterbalance
to
each
other
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
not
watery
and
very
mild
aftertaste
there
was
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
on
the
palate
afterward
which
is
what
i
prefer
drinkability
was
good
as
the
flavor
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
were
all
what
i
was
looking
for
at
the
time
paired
well
with
an
order
of
tacos
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
people
that
like
local
apas
d
i
have
had
this
when
it
was
fresher
and
it
is
a
good
pale
ale
however
i
let
this
sit
too
long
and
it
was
past
its
prime
right
now
drinkability
takes
a
hit
because
of
that
fairly
strong
chemical
smell
coming
from
the
beer
i
like
the
way
this
beer
tastes
as
it
is
now
its
just
a
little
off
ill
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
because
i
think
this
has
some
pretty
nice
potential
i
took
a
risk
on
a
dusty
bottle
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
paid
off
this
time
but
ill
definitely
give
this
another
try
in
the
future
because
its
got
promise
clear
copper
color
medium
sized
beige
head
that
leaves
rings
and
spots
of
lace
aroma
is
nice
and
subdued
a
little
toffeish
a
little
buttery
a
little
citrusy
toffeeish
malt
base
lays
down
the
foundation
pretty
sturdy
malt
base
hop
attributes
could
use
a
boost
i
get
a
little
lemon
citrus
and
some
lingering
bitterness
but
not
as
much
as
an
apa
should
have
good
enough
beer
but
not
a
top
notch
apa
shiny
amber
in
color
with
a
big
happy
head
that
roared
to
the
top
of
the
glass
and
narrowly
missed
spilling
over
all
that
i
like
in
an
apa
was
evident
in
the
aroma
emphasis
on
malt
with
a
yeasty
background
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
nice
taste
of
crackers
and
malt
up
front
in
the
taste
followed
by
caramel
toffee
and
some
lemons
at
the
finish
more
complex
than
some
other
apas
in
part
because
the
hops
were
quietly
subdued
without
being
suffocated
decent
body
but
as
with
their
london
porter
i
wanted
just
a
tad
more
density
still
id
have
another
of
these
any
time
good
score
the
beer
is
quite
dry
a
bit
prickly
on
the
mouth
some
dry
caramel
flavors
english
malts
abound
there
are
some
leafy
hops
to
balance
things
out
some
cracked
graininess
and
some
toffee
flavors
as
well
the
dry
slightly
bittering
cream
soda
flavors
the
saltene
feel
in
the
finish
the
toffee
flavors
and
the
rather
traditional
english
pale
malts
pretty
much
define
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
fairly
mild
there
isnt
tons
of
carbonation
to
this
beer
either
the
beer
does
clean
the
palate
quite
nicely
this
is
an
all
around
decent
pale
ale
dan
okay
and
drinkable
brew
but
not
fantastic
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
back
in
the
early
90s
have
not
seen
it
in
years
so
i
was
very
happy
to
see
it
back
in
pa
a
12
ounce
bottle
picked
up
at
the
beer
stop
for
around
1
75
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
rich
copper
color
with
at
least
an
inch
of
dense
bone
white
head
flavors
and
aromas
are
of
grassy
citrus
tinged
hops
lemon
toasted
grain
a
decent
amount
of
caramelized
malt
bready
and
earthy
above
aerge
body
with
ample
carbonation
for
a
pale
ale
still
quite
drinkable
as
well
d
an
easytodrink
apa
with
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
nothing
overly
special
but
still
a
very
decent
entry
and
probably
my
favorite
gearys
beer
to
date
nice
session
beer
drinkability
slightly
above

could

d
how
can
you
not
try
a
beer
in
the
northeast
that
has
a
lobster
on
the
label
and
its
a
good
pale
ale
too
flavor
is
somewhat
lacking
just
not
a
whole
lot
there
there
is
some
dry
bitterness
from
the
hops
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
hop
flavor
a
bit
watereddown
tasting
malts
are
biscuit
and
caramellike
definitely
some
yeast
presence
thanks
to
the
ringwood
element
carbonation
was
good
and
mouthfeel
was

very

one

and
is
still
quite
popular
today
while
now
and
days
itll
probably
be
considered
unoffensive

it
is
not
necessarily
a

because

with

if

i
could
drink
this
beer
for

i

for

this
is

finally
a
true
pale
ale
with
some
real
character
other
than
hops
and
so
far
gearys
has
helped
me
reconsider
my
previous
aversion
for
both
pale
and
strong
ales
mouthfeeldrinkability
active
and
pleasing
in
the
mouth
without
being
overly
carbonated
i
would
have
liked
more
of
hop
bite
however
this
beer
certainly
has
its
place
glad
to
have
tried
it
gearys
pale
ale
is
anything
but
a
typical
version
for
brewers
who
ply
their
trade
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
its
a
good
one
though
and
would
make
a
wonderful
session
ale
as
long
as
one
has
a
high
tolerance
for
bubbles
thanks
to
maines
own
jrdegriselles
for
the
bottle
i
like
a
a
hoppy
beer
but
this
one
just
didnt
cut
it
for
me
taste
is
kind
of
blah
fairly
strong
bitterness
and
some
sour
hop
flavor
but
almost
no
malts
evident
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
and
watery
its
drinkable
but
without
much
enthusiasm
there
are
lots
of
better
pale
ales
available
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
a
big
winner
i
like
some
thing
different
mk
peace
bc
d
nothing
offensive
but
theres
nothing
here
that
suggests
that
this
is
a
beer
that
i
should
drink
again
im
generally
a
fan
of
ringwood
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
i
was
a
little
worried
as
the
bottle
was
a
touch
dusty
but
i
think
the
beer
pulled
through
looked
good
and
smelled
of
hops
with
a
touch
of
ringwood
tastes
of
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
the
ringwood
is
there
and
nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
weak
especially
for
an
apa
id
call
it
an
english
pale
ale
not
an
amazing
beer
but
definately
session
worthy
this
is
not
an
apa
their
website
even
says
so
but
its
good
no
4
5s
but
good
session
brew
profound
malt
character
in
the
taste
a
little
bit
nutty
a
bit
of
caramel
and
biscuit
actually
strikes
me
as
similar
to
anchor
steam
in
malt
character
sweetness
is
briskly
washed
away
by
a
hop
tingle
and
carbonation
balanced
refreshing
tasty
seems
much
more
english
to
me
than
american
solid
medium
body
mellow
carbonation
really
drinkable
and
quenching
for
how
competent
it
is
recommended
poured
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
fairly
quickly
dissipated
with
no
lacing
mostly
malt
on
the
nose
with
just
a
whiff
of
hops
a
little
weak
tasting
at
first
but
with
a
nice
but
restrained
hop
aftertaste
fairly
nice
flavor
profile
dry
nicely
balanced
hops
and
malt
tastes
more
like
an
esb
than
an
american
pale
ale
the
beer
is
not
quite
as
crisp
as
i
would
like
and
it
does
have
a
little
bit
of
a
soapy
mouthfeel
midpalate
and
then
finishes
dryer
and
slightly
astringent
overall
not
bad
could
be
a
session
beer
with
some
english
cheese
and
crackers
overall
a
nice
and
maltier
than
most
apa
very
quaffable
pours
a
pale
coppers
with
a
light
head
i
smell
hops
and
a
bit
of
estery
ringwood
taste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
not
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
but
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
its
backed
up
by
a
light
buttery
ringwood
flavor
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
the
beer
is
surprisingly
thin
not
bad
just
not
as
full
as
i
would
expect
this
was
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
head
but
some
nice
lacing
it
had
a
fresh
grain
sweet
aroma
the
taste
was
malty
with
some
caramel
hops
showed
up
later
a
nice
respectable
beer
i
drink
this
or
the
hsa
as
my
everyday
beers
try
it
youll
like
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
is
ok
nice
malty
pale
ale
overall
quite
impressive
for
my
first
gearys
id
consider
a
six
pack
of
this
time
well
spent
moderate
to
full
mouth
with
no
residuals
a
solid
session
beer
for
sure
eh
its
a
pale
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
there
are
much
better
ones
to
spend
your
money
on
if
the
brewery
was
closer
to
where
i
live
i
might
be
more
interested
in
trying
it
again
really
fresh
not
saying
freshness
was
an
issue
here
gearys
flagship
product
lets
see
how
it
turns
out
pours
a
perfect
amber
color
and
an
impressive
half
inch
white
head
a
very
good
looking
beer
nose
was
of
doughy
biscuits
light
fruit
and
a
marvelous
floral
bouquet
to
top
it
off
the
taste
was
rather
dry
with
the
biscuit
flavors
accompanied
by
a
nice
hoppiness
and
some
slight
juice
tastes
pulling
through
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
damn
near
perfect
in
its
medium
body
this
is
also
a
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
seems
like
an
ideal
candidate
for
even
some
beer
drinkers
not
accustomed
to
heavier
hop
loads
and
new
tastes
i
really
enjoyed
this
pale
ale
with
the
alcohol
being
relatively
low
and
the
quality
of
the
taste
being
so
high
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
if
not
best
pale
ales
that
i
have
sampled
in
months
past
the
aroma
is
similar
to
wet
straw
and
grassy
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
hoppiness
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
and
has
a
very
carbonated
taste
there
is
a
dry
flavor
with
slight
bitterness
and
some
citrus
this
one
is
a
weak
attempt
at
a
pale
ale
imo
overall
i
am
hoping
that
this
is
a
skunked
bottle
it
is
undrinkable
down
the
drain
you
go
tastes
like
a
meister
brau
in
a
can
pours
a
goldenamber
im
tempted
to
say
orangeish
color
the
head
is
white
an
brilliant
but
of
average
quality
and
duration
the
aroma
is
a
extremely
citrusylike
sticking
grapefruit
slices
up
your
nostrils
theres
a
little
malt
and
ester
play
going
on
behind
the
scenes
but
the
smell
is
all
about
the
hops
the
taste
has
a
slight
caramel
bent
to
it
and
is
notably
dry
and
abrupt
medium
fullness
of
body
but
the
dryness
and
citric
quality
dont
seem
to
match
the
hops
it
just
doesnt
come
together
very
well
finish
is
hoppy
and
dry
certainly
this
is
an
american
style
pale
ale
but
unfortunately
its
an
average
one
a
very
clear
dark
amber
colorbut
the
head
is
smallishone
finger
this
has
a
slight
spice
aromabut
not
much
this
tastes
a
little
light
for
a
pale
ale
this
isnt
very
hoppy
gearys
has
made
a
pale
ale
thats
drybut
with
not
much
flavor
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
againits
okbut
there
are
so
many
betterpale
ales
on
the
market
certainly
a
good
pale
ale
one
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
i
think
its
more
english
than
american
in
overall
character
i
think
i
prefer
the
other
3
gearys
beers
that
ive
had
hsa
london
porter
autumn
over
this
one
though
reviewed
this
earlier
this
summer
and
was
wondering
if
it
was
just
a
fluke
that
i
liked
it
so
much
on
that
particular
night
but
upon
picking
up
a
sixer
and
trying
it
from
the
bottle
this
is
just
a
world
class
beer
and
im
baffled
once
again
that
it
gets
average
reviews
it
may
be
slightly
better
on
tap
but
its
no
slouch
from
the
bottle
either
i
just
love
the
hopping
of
this
brew
its
perfect
nice
dusty
spicy
herbal
boquet
of
hops
on
top
of
a
nice
pale
malt
profile
excellent
dry
mouthfeel
and
this
beer
is
so
nice
to
drink
ive
sort
of
become
addicted
to
it
everytime
i
got
into
the
store
i
end
up
debating
whether
to
get
the
gearys
or
something
i
havent
had
recently
and
this
beer
usually
wins
it
out
and
thats
strange
because
i
never
usually
drink
a
lot
of
the
same
beer
over
and
over
i
definately
urge
people
to
go
out
and
try
this
again
with
an
open
mind
because
i
think
its
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
well
made
beer
that
ive
come
across
a
pretty
average
apa
with
slightly
above
average
taste
and
drinkability
other
than
that
its
typical
nothing
special
to
go
back
to
pretty
standard
for
an
american
micro
brewery
similar
to
sarnac
not
a
very
popular
brand
in
ma
but
nonetheless
quite
good
light
pale
in
apperence
with
a
pretty
healthy
head
that
maintained
its
retention
and
lacing
to
the
bottle
of
the
glass
this
beer
was
heavily
spiced
with
a
mild
hop
aftertaste
a
good
dinner
beer
this
is
a
pretty
light
apa
it
could
almost
be
and
epa
out
of
all
the
beers
i
have
discovered
this
summer
this
is
by
far
the
most
consumable
good
to
go
drinkability
is
that
this
is
drinkable
pretty
mediocre
beer
but
as
mentioned
above
you
go
with
what
you
got
and
in
the
wilderness
local
micros
will
always
prevail
in
my
selection
versus
the
mass
alternative
nicely
done
beer
i
am
not
a
big
pa
fan
not
hoppy
enough
but
this
a
quality
interpretation
that
i
find
very
enjoyable
nice
sweet
taste
the
caramel
malts
come
through
with
the
hops
lingering
very
smoothe
and
easy
to
drink
has
a
small
bite
to
it
but
not
harsh
at
all
overall
a
very
good
yet
different
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
light
coating
of
head
over
top
the
nose
is
big
on
spicey
and
peppery
hop
not
a
lot
of
sweet
caramel
but
its
there
in
the
back
the
flavor
is
rather
dull
as
well
just
a
light
caramel
malt
with
a
slight
orangey
and
pepperyness
hanging
over
it
id
like
a
little
more
hop
in
there
the
feel
is
a
light
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
just
an
okay
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
visit
it
again
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
comprised
of
caramel
with
hints
of
diacetyl
but
i
dont
get
much
in
the
hop
category
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
caramel
and
diacetyl
no
hops
there
nothing
noticeable
at
least
body
is
light
to
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
perhaps
this
is
an
old
bottle
but
its
definately
missing
something
very
thick
creamy
foam

with

from

i
definitely
wouldnt

having
another
one
hazy
honey
colored
with
a
firm
orangeybeige
head
that
rises
up
a
half
inch
high
and
then
settles
down
low
but
leaves
a
racing
stripe
all
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
just
above
the
beer
aroma
is
malty
and
biscuity
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
flavor
is
also
malty
light
and
on
the
sweet
side
with
pear
and

understated

barely

but
an

bitter
lingers
decent
selection
but
fairly
average
a
standard
but
very
well
made
and
solid
pale
ale
pours
a
light
golden
hue
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
citrusy
hoppy
nature
the
taste
is
of
light
hops
balanced
nicely
by
a
malt
background
i
taste
some
sort
of
fruity
presence
at
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
mildly
bitter
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
but
lacks
depth
and
complexity
this
is
probably
more
a
style
trait
than
a
specific
trait
of
this
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
level
seems
a
bit
on
the
high
side
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
out
to
be
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
head
tastes
of
both
malts
and
hops
but
not
good
malts
or
good
hops
the
flavor
profile
has
good
balance
but
it
isnt
balancing
anything
good
so
that
point
is
moot
i
can
not
quite
pinpoint
why
im
not
into
this
brew
but
i
am
certainly
not
into
this
brew
and
i
will
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
maine
beer
is
overrated
as
a
rule
anyway
not
worth
your
time
after
a
thin
pour
a
negligible
head
vaporizes
to
become
a
little
ring
around
edge
of
beer
despite
a
few
streaming
bubbles
beer
is
translucent
bronze
in
color
and
very
clear
with
highlights
that
are
somewhat
metallic
in
reflectivity
detecting
an
aroma
is
quite
a
struggle
but
eventually
i
find
an
intitial
biscuitsandtoothpaste
combination
thats
not
all
that
pleasant
and
some
bitter
orange
rind
with
warmth
no
real
nosefeel
to
speak
of
flavor
is
mostly
a
mellow
bitterness
with
a
rugged
acridity
in
the
aftertaste
with
suggestions
of
sourdough
bread
and
an
indistinct
somewhat
citric
fruitiness
on
the
plus
side
the
bitterness
is
fullbodied
rather
than
piquant
which
aids
the
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
sufficiently
slick
for
a
session
beer
but
is
also
frankly
boring
above
average
but
not
memorable
a
clean
amber
ale
with
not
much
of
an
off
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
had
a
light
malty
sweetness
about
it
but
not
much
else
the
taste
started
out
with
a
easy
sweet
maltyness
and
finished
with
a
smooth
hop
finish
not
a
bad
ale
for
having
more
than
one
poured
a
faint
copper
color
with
a
compact
think
sticky
head
a
nice
pale
ale
sittin
out
by
the
fire
abit
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
malt
blending
well
together
a
bit
of
a
butery
taste
was
present
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
or
from
them
drinkability

this
was
a
nice
refreshing
pale
ale
that
one
would
welcome
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
a
pale
that
should
appeal
to
a
lot
of
palates
really
this
is
just
a
classic
new
england
pale
ale
if
such
a
thing
exists
a
mix
of
english
ale
american
hoppyness
and
just
that
classic
new
england
water
taste
a
great
session
beer
good
drinkability
for
a
fairly
nonexciting
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
body
was
medium
nice
carbonation
levels
relatively
clean
finish
and
little
aftertaste
very
drinkable
and
can
be
a
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
reddish
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
good
scent
of
pale
malts
and
aroma
hops
it
has
a
bit
of
sweet
maltiness
to
it
probably
some
light
crystal
malts
added
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
good
balance
between
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
along
with
some
mild
flavoring
hops
it
is
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
a
fine
pale
ale
and
a
rarity
around
here
that
i
was
genuinely
pleased
to
try
certainly
if
i
can
find
other
gearys
products
ill
be
glad
to
try
those
as
well
had
heard
alot
about
this
beer
and
gave
it
a
try
while
in
portlandmildlydissapointed
pours
a
nice
medium
golden
color
with
a
lighter
head
that
does
leave
some
decent
lacingaroma
is
malty
and
slightly
metallic
taste
seema
little
dry
for
me
not
quite
enough
maltysweetness
there
is
a
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
not
enough
sweetness
for
my
liking
while
in
my
opinion
not
a
complex
flavored
pale
ale
gearys
holds
its
own
as
a
quality
craft
brew
an
excellent
pale
ale
brewed
to
the
english
style
wonderfully
balanced
and
flavorful
definitely
a
session
ale
for
any
occasion
taste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
hints
of
sour
apple
lightly
malty
with
hints
of
lemon
as
well
medium
bodied
with
light
hoppy
aftertaste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
flavorful
as
well
very
well
balanced
the
best
pale
ale
brewed
in
maine
and
my
local
goto
brew
goes
anywhere
with
anything
light
bronze
hue
with
a
slight
murk
thin
frothy
pitted
head
manages
sparse
foam
trails
the
aroma
is
a
soft
melange
of
floral
hops
with
a
citrusy
tinge
along
with
mild
bready
pale
malt
and
light
lovibond
caramel
sweetness
faint
ripe
pear
esters
add
a
green
fruity
presence
balanced
understated
aroma
ashen
caramel
malt
initially
in
flavor
is
offset
by
a
crisp
cleansing
hop
bitterness
which
develops
into
a
woody
lightly
earthy
hop
flavor
subdued
diacetyl
emerges
mid
palate
and
complements
the
balmy
toffeeish
malt
backbone
light
in
overall
body
but
pleasantly
dextrinous
and
lightly
viscous
in
mouthfeel
finishes
with
an
agreeable
surge
of
savory
cracked
grain
laden
salted
biscuit
which
leaves
the
palate
parched
and
ready
for
more
a
no
frills
well
rounded
superbly
drinkable
brew
that
treads
the
wide
boundary
between
american
and
english
pales
gearys
pale
would
be
a
staple
brew
in
the
fridge
for
easy
quaffing
if
i
lived
in
maine
thanks
to
bennybrew
for
reuniting
me
with
the
first
maine
brew
i
ever
had
that
was
5
years
ago
in
limestone
me
nice
cloudy
coppery
look
very
little
head
with
some
slight
lacing
decent
hoppy
aroma
that
held
up
in
the
taste
which
had
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
it
mouthfeel
wasnt
that
balanced
though
and
aftertaste
was
not
that
great
average
drinkability
not
as
good
as
their
hampshire
ale
this
beer
had
a
nice
copper
color
to
it
with
no
head
and
little
lace
it
was
pretty
balanced
but
leaning
a
bit
to
the
bitter
side
hops
were
evident
in
the
smell
and
in
the
taste
it
went
down
pretty
well
but
to
me
was
an
average
pale
ale
not
a
bad
thing
though
i
liked
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
bright
amber
hue
a
thin
head
no

noted
some
malty
and
a
touch
of
orange
peel
on
the

some

flavors
delicate
citrus
noted
throughout
the
body
hops
tough
to
detect
medium

creamy
and
light
toasty
finish
minimal
ibus
leave
me
wondering
where
are
the
hops
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
more
however
i
dont
feel
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
per
night
hence
my
relatively
low
drinkability
rating
less
than
average
appearance
when
poured
a
clear
amber
in
color
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
thick
malt
texture
crisp
mouthfeel
that
wasnt
overly
carbonated
lingering
bitterness
and
more
body
than
the
pale
ale
im
used
too
it
might
be
just
a
maine
thing
with
the
malty
beers
overall
averagebut
well
balanced
with
a
fairly
good
drinkability
rate

bright

topped
by
a
hearty
foamy
slighty
offwhite

is
biscuits

floral

herbal
hops
and
a
little

body
with
an
accompaniment
of
eurohops
across
the
top
finishes
dry
with
a
little
lingering
hop
tang
smooth
drinking
with
enough
carbonation
to
be
refreshing
a
very
easy
drinking
very
enjoyable
pale
ale
bridging
both
american
and
british
styles
an
old
timer
that
should
not
be
neglected
this
is
a
beer
i
would
have
probably
never
tried
if
not
for
ba
its
pretty
hard
to
find
in
my
area
pours
a
very
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
bubbly
head
its
got
a
very
american
like
hoppy
scent
on
the
citrousy
side
the
taste
is
very
grainy
with
a
slight
citrousy
aftertaste
very
smooth
mouthfeel
not
as
crisp
hoppy
in
taste
as
the
aroma
suggests
but
a
good
pale
ale
this
seems
to
be
what
a
pale
ale
should
taste
like
with
sierra
nevada
being
more
on
the
ipa
side
of
things
glad
i
tried
this
one
i
imagine
on
tap
it
would
be
great
definitive
amber
color
with
fairly
longlasting
big
bubbled
head
on
draft
high
marks
for
drinkability
the
result
of
wonderful
hopsmalt
balance
neither
overtake
each
other
nothing
is
out
of
place
very
late
hoppy
dryness
with
momentary
acidity
results
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
finish
that
dont
laugh
i
think
this
is
a
good
thing
holds
me
off
on
brushing
my
teeth
the
aftertaste
is
that
good
the
pour
a
unclouded
amber
color
the
head
is
modest
in
size
bubbly
in
structure
and
a
very
light
tan
in
color
with
the
lace
a
thin
sheet
upon
the
glass
malt
dominated
is
the
nose
citrus
crisp
and
fresh
the
start
is
malt
laden
slightly
sweet
the
top
slender
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
persistent
acidic
bite
the
hops
moderate
in
their
presence
and
spiciness
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
the
hot
summer
days
just
around
the
corner
this
pale
ale
poured
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
creamy
white
foam
and
some
nice
small
bubbling
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
modest
but
good
citrus
malt
bisuity
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
taste
was
first
hops
floral
and
bitter
and
then
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
the
flavors
were
nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
crisp
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
lingering
hop
flavors
the
body
was
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
modest
the
was
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
ale
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
and
would
drink
this
any
ol
time
f
i
am
very
happy
i
have
finally
tried
gearys
pale
ale
pours
out
to
a
nice
amberbrown
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
that
of
biscuit
and
a
light
floral
smell
taste
is
that
of
a
very
light
grapefruit
mixed
with
malt
and
caramel
not
as
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
although
my
companions
at
the
bar
thought
it
was
but
they
are
new
to
hops
but
it
is
extremely
forgive
me
smooth
a
session
pale
if
there
ever
was
one
for
me
an
aroma
adds
so
much
to
a
brew
and
gearys
pale
ale
is
a
perfect
example
of
that
a
big
citrus
cascade
nose
upfront
with
a
sweet
nutty
malt
aroma
backing
it
up
delivers
enjoyment
before
you
even
taste
it
the
enjoyment
continues
with
this
clear
bronze
brew
when
the
flavors
of
sweet
bread
and
date
fade
to
a
light
bitterness
maine
proves
again
they
can
brew
great
beer
with
this
fantastic
pale
ale
well
its
been
great
getting
into
this
community
of
beer
fanatics
and
since
i
have
been
here
there
is
one
beer
that
has
been
suggested
by
one
man
over
and
over
again
yep
its
gearys
pale
ale
and
right
now
everything
else
can
wait
because
this
beer
is
my
100th
review
this
will
be
my
first
maine
beer
and
this
review
is
for
johnnyp
and
the
rest
of
bas
from
throughout
new
england
appearance
well
hey
theres
a
lobster
on
the
bottle
it
has
to
be
from
maine
pours
a
copper
amber
tone
with
an
off
white
cream
colored
head
is
leaving
a
nice
thin
lace
down
the
sides
of
my
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
filled
with
sweet
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
hop
aroma
very
pleasant
aroma
here
there
is
a
nut
flavor
in
the
first
sip
thats
complemented
with
a
balanced
blend
of
malts
and
hops
pretty
good
all
around
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
body
but
this
beer
has
such
a
great
taste
there
doesnt
need
to
be
any
fireworks
in
the
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
could
be
a
go
to
session
brew
if
it
was
widely
available
down
my
way
but
i
now
see
why
johnnyp
holds
this
beer
in
a
special
place
in
his
heart
gets
this
west
virginians
seal
of
approval
if
you
havent
tried
a
beer
from
maine
heres
a
place
to
start
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
poured
copper
with
a
minimal
head
there
was
some
sediment
in
mine
which
im
not
sure
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
there
no
date
on
the
bottle
so
im
not
sure
if
its
past
date
floral
hoppy
aroma
with
a
touch
of
peach
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
hoppy
but
not
too
hoppy
with
peach
notes
seems
to
be
a
dry
malt
base
light
bodied
id
definitely
drink
this
one
again
but
i
dont
know
that
id
seek
it
out
as
a
permanent
fixture
in
my
fridge
pours
a
nice
orange
colour
with
a
strong
head
that
dissolves
fairly
quickly
yet
never
completely
dissapears
caramel
is
apparent
in
smell
and
taste
and
is
underscored
by
fruit
flavouring
and
hints
of
saltiness
a
bit
different
for
a
pale
ale
but
its
one
of
my
favourite
new
england
brews
and
i
make
sure
i
always
grab
some
when
i
can
this
beer
can
be
summed
up
in
one
word
uneventful
even
on
tap
it
had
no
real
hops
or
malts
that
jumped
out
it
did
not
even
have
that
pale
taste
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
it
was
just
there
bland
it
went
down
easy
due
to
the
fact
it
had
no
taste
this
should
be
called
gearys
ultra
sudsy
bite
on
the
tongue
suds
bite
the
whole
way
through
actually
peach
notes
return
in
the
midtaste
with
peachpit
bitterness
in
tow
finish
is
fairly
nondescript
save
for
theyou
guessed
itpeaches
expected
citrus
hop
aroma
from
this
amber
beer
caramel
malt
flavor
that
is
almost
a
bit
nutty
medium
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
slight
metallic
and
mineral
flavors
compliment
bitterness
instead
of
distract
you
easy
enjoyable
drinking
but
nothing
spectacular
here
in
portland
maine
where
gearys
is
made
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
better
beer
for
the
price
now
10
99
a
twelve
unless
its
the
gearys
hampshire
special
ale
when
available
deep
dark
copper
color
much
darker
than
i
expected
head
was
tanbeige
full
of
rich
hop
bubbles
nice
floralhoppy
aromas
no
sourness
noticed
taste
was
balanced
and
better
than
i
expected
nice
sweet
malty
presence
lots
of
florals
citrus
and
hop
goodness
thirst
quenching
goodness
crisp
dry
finish
a
very
good
pale
ale
better
than
bass
and
lots
of
others
cool
label
too
i
had
this
with
a
lobster
dinner
in
maine
and
it
was
perfect
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
decent
head
that
dies
pretty
quick
on
the
nose
there
is
a
slight
fruitiness
herbs
and
herb
aromas
the
same
is
found
on
the
palate
slight
fruitiness
herbs
slightly
sweet
light
malt
and
a
nice
bitterness
finish
is
bitter
and
slightly
sour
overall
a
good
pale
ale
note
thanks
to
my
dad
for
bringing
back
this
brew
from
a
trip
to
maine
nectar
of
the
gods
as
far
as
im
concerned
perfect
off
white
head
clear
light
amber
color
sweet
malty
caramel
aroma
with
hint
of
fruit
this
is
all
a
pale
ale
can
be
crisp
refreshing
attack
almost
lemony
followed
by
bittersweet
malt
middle
closing
to
a
hoppy
but
well
balanced
finish
eat
your
heart
out
bass
a
lower
score
on
drinkability
because
the
first
sip
usually
tastes
the
best
nicely
salty
very
new
england
a
true
seaside
beer
goes
great
with
seafood
hint
take
a
look
at
the
label
i
love
malts
and
this
has
plenty
plus
an
incredible
hop
element
to
twist
it
to
just
the
right
dynamic
bliss
you
either
like
gearys
or
you
dont
i
happen
to
like
this
brew
overall
its
fairly
traditional
a
slice
of
ringwood
brewing
history
in
new
england
and
a
good
drink
pours
a
nice
pale
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
that
never
sinks
completely
smell
is
earthyfruity
hops
and
slight
malt
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
subtle
hopping
that
grows
into
a
nice
full
flavored
hop
profile
you
can
just
slightly
taste
the
cascades
behind
the
lighter
english
style
hopping
there
is
a
nice
malt
balance
to
this
beer
but
not
so
much
that
it
takes
away
from
the
hops
clean
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
nicely
drinkable
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
english
tyle
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
american
influence
great
session
brew
or
for
a
few
while
working
the
grill
notes
a
wonderful
english
style
pale
ale
with
a
new
england
twist
gets
even
better
when
at
cellar
temperature
a
good
everyday
brew
nothing
extrodinary
an
average
session
brew
or
introductory
pale
ale
theres
a
lot
of
other
beers
id
choose
first
like
jonnyp
this
was
one
of
my
first
micros
back
in
the
summer
of
87
on
a
trip
to
portland
a
sentimental
favorite
that
got
me
hooked
on
the
dry
ringwood
style
beers
i
got
this
out
of
pure
curiosity
and
now
im
not
sure
why
i
doubt
i
will
get
again
unless
im
in
an
actual
pub
in
england
very
good
ale
would
choose
this
over
most
pilsners
at
a
bar
semi
brownish
color
with
hints
of
nuts
cream
very
smooth
finish
on
draft
easy
drinkin
beer
very
bland
its
like
drinking
poor
tasting
water
with
a
slight
bit
of
creaminess
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
it
smells
so
much
better
than
it
tastes
which
is
weird
i
remember
liking
this
beer
a
whole
lot
more
before
i
got
into
craft
but
honestly
i
think
it
was
brewed
better
back
then
too
o
appearance
and
smell
were
great
the
taste
and
feel
awful
i
was
tricked
not
sure
why
people
drink
this
pretty
and
creamy
but
has
a
distinct
taste
that
i
associate
with
cheap
beer
and
got
worse
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
bit
couldnt
finish
it
creaminess
caused
it
to
be
heavier
than
rice
lager
alternatives
so
its
not
even
much
good
as
an
ice
cold
binge
drinking
beer
overall
id
take
this
over
a
bud
miller
or
coors
but
thats
about
it
its
not
bad
it
just
isnt
good
at
all
by
far
a
disgusting
beer
enjoy
on
nitro
which
i
dont
think
helped
it
unpleasant
smell
taste
is
ok
but
rough
aroma
is
buttery
and
toffeelike
with
soft
floral
notes
flavor
reveals
fruity
undertones
that
i
dont
recall
being
there
in
the
past
seems
oxidized
theres
a
bit
of
cardboard
body
is
thin
moderately
bitter
finish
metallic
notes
surface
late
and
this
is
draft
smooth
slightly
creamy
but
too
lite
creamy
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
like
the
nitro
but
the
taste
isnt
there
this
beer
is
the
smoothest
creamiest
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
love
it
not
bad
just
not
good
either
this
was
just
really
weird
great
feel
very
smooth
the
smoothest
easiest
drinking
beer
that
i
ever
had
sometimes
its
worth
cause
it
costs
1
79
for
a
16oz
but
still
overall
pass
on
this
it
looks
great
smells
good
and
is
very
drinkable
but
it
just
doesnt
have
any
flavor
at
all
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
i
really
like
the
way
this
one
looks
as
its
poured
fron
the
nitro
can
big
head
that
dissipates
slowly
to
finally
settle
to
a
half
inch
head
that
stays
to
the
end
you
do
get
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
this
one
that
is
nice
bet
there
is
no
visible
carbonation
there
was
for
me
no
detectable
hop
bitterness
there
is
a
different
taste
to
this
that
some
seem
to
not
enjoy
but
that
i
just
found
to
be
unusual
a
mild
low
abv
choice
that
pairs
well
with
a
lot
of
food
styles
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
think
i
just
drank
watered
down
iced
tea
nice
color
to
it
no
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
texture
lacking
in
taste
tasted
watery
wow
pretty
awful
beer
from
across
the
pond
creamy
smooth
with
an
average
pale
lager
type
aroma
taste
overall
an
okay
english
bitter
but
certainly
too
flat
in
feel
for
my
liking
id
really
enjoy
trying
this
one
on
tap
instead
of
from
the
bottle
nonetheless
decent
for
au83
for
a
24
x
440ml
case
i
seem
to
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
definitely
better
draft
than
in
the
can
smooth
taste
and
very
creamy
head
easy
to
knock
lots
of
these
back
at
the
pub
pours
and
sits
in
glass
like
a
quintessential
beer
smooth
style
and
very
light
easy
on
the
taste
and
easy
to
drink
cool
and
refreshing
for
a
quick
light
and
easy
party
beer
or
summer
refresher
on
the
pond
better
than
hens
tooth
still
not
as
good
as
new
castle
this
is
a
horrible
beer
creamy
and
good
as
any
once
youre
a
handful
of
beers
in
to
the
night
i
do
not
write
reviews
i
love
this
beer
not
sure
why
its
reviews
are
so
low
good
beer
fairly
easy
to
find
and
satisfying
has
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
a
mellow
flavor
not
very
hoppy
however
it
has
strong
citrus
tones
to
it
nice
pale
yellow
head
with
a
moderate
alcohol
content
pairs
well
with
light
fish
tilapia
trout
catfish
halibut
etc
and
cold
sandwiches
this
is
a
great
beer
anyone
who
has
a
chance
to
enjoy
one
should
boddingtons
is
unique
because
of
its
mouthfeel
especially
out
of
the
pub
can
with
widget
think
guinness
the
best
way
i
can
describe
the
feel
is
velvety
definitely
nitroish
the
taste
is
very
much
like
what
youd
expect
not
too
impressive
standard
pub
fare
easy
to
drink
i
would
recommend
trying
it
based
purely
on
the
unique
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
cheers
pours
a
nice
burnt
orange
and
gold
color
with
a
little
cloudiness
and
a
nice
offwhite
head
smell
is
exactly
as
noted
above
very
intense
citrus
and
pine
hops
tastes
of
citrus
and
fairly
hoppy
but
not
overbearing
perfect
for
all
night
drinking
light
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
smooth
and
almost
creamy
a
very
yummy
brew

this
is
my
goto
at
the
local
pub
delicious
and
creamy
o
while
i
wouldnt
drive
to
the
bar
to
get
this
one
i
was
surprised
by
the
nice
finish
on
the
beer
other
than
that
the
beer
is
fairly
forgettable
not
sure
i
would
call
it
the
fair
guinness
it
is
a
bit
overly
sweet
and
lacks
complexity
enjoyable
for
buying
in
a
can
i
prefer
draft
relatively
smooth
and
creamy
pour
not
exceptional
but
pleasant
and
drinkable
without
much
that
stands
out
creamy
almost
looks
like
a
light
guinness
when
poured
nitro
can
poured
into
glass
thick
cascading
carbonation
settled
to
an
almost
2
finger
head
smelled
dry
and
malty
malty
dry
not
much
hop
if
any
noticeable
creamy
but
medium
feel
not
heavy
but
not
watery
no
carbonation
i
really
liked
this
beer
appropriately
poured
into
a
pint
glass
beautiful
cascading
super
thick
and
creamy
head
beer
is
between
golden
and
amber
very
subtle
malt
characters
and
sweet
caramel
aromas
very
smooth
and
creamy
not
too
much
taste
but
i
actually
really
like
this
its
extremely
drinkable
the
start
with
the
creamy
head
is
nicely
complimented
with
a
waterysmooth
finish
overall
other
than
the
nitro
which
is
a
nice
gimmick
this
is
a
very
bland
ale
with
not
much
going
on
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
nashville
outstanding
one
of
my
favorites
amber
foamy
creamy
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
i
love
this
one
would
i
recommend
it
no
for
my
part
i
wont
buy
again
its
really
special
but
if
you
are
in
england
you
can
still
give
it
a
try
and
see
pours
from
nitro
can
a
golden
brew
creamy
head
lots
of
lacing
hints
of
banana
a
very
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
i
almost
always
have
one
in
my
fridge
i
sometimes
use
it
to
cleanse
the
mouth
after
a
more
complex
beer
the
blonde
guiness
not
big
on
flavor
or
aroma
but
a
highly
drinkable
smooth
character
possibly
a
hint
of
honey
hiding
in
there
multiple
beers
easily
shared
among
friends
i
really
like
this
great
flavor
very
well
rounded
its
not
your
everyday
beer
and
you
need
to
pour
it
and
let
it
settle
or
you
arent
giving
it
a
fair
shake
but
i
highly
recommend
it
yikes
is
this
really
considered
good
beer
in
england
if
so
than
i
am
really
proud
to
be
an
american
smells
like
astringent
mixed
with
rubbing
alcohol
the
taste
is
awful
not
sure
what
piss
tastes
like
but
i
imagine
this
is
pretty
close
if
i
was
in
a
desert
and
this
was
the
only
liquid
i
had
to
drink
i
would
rather
die
of
dehydration
awful
just
plain
awful
not
horrible
just
onedimensional
with
a
somewhat
unpleasant
aftertaste
thin
as
if
a
more
flavorful
ale
was
watereddown
some
that
said
boddy
was
one
of
the
beers
that
helped
move
me
away
from
american
macros
many
years
ago
so
some
credit
for
that
unfortunately
there
are
so
many
other
more
flavorful
products
on
the
market
today
what
was
interesting
20
years
ago
is
unremarkable
today
i
read
the
review
by
kerouac
from
california
and
i
think
he
nailed
it
an
easy
beer
to
session
boddingtons
is
a
refreshing
smooth
beer
renowned
for
its
golden
colour
fullbodied
flavour
and
malty
moreish
taste
with
smooth
tight
creamy
head
this
is
one
beer
that
while
not
up
to
certain
peoples
hoppy
standards
i
keep
coming
back
to
again
and
again
its
like
an
affair
with
that
plain
looking
mistress
who
satisfies
at
a
certain
price
point
like
nobody
else
can
ive
been
helplessly
in
love
with
this
brew
since
working
in
warrington
for
a
summer
back
in
the
early
90s
always
my
first
choice
if
an
establishment
carries
it
the
golden
color
is
amazing
and
the
low
carbonation
sweet
taste
is
just
wonderful
to
me
man
i
wish
i
had
a
pint
or
10
right
now
enjoy
i
know
this
beer
tends
to
get
really
negative
reviews
and
out
of
the
can
i
agree
its
not
great
however
there
is
something
about
this
beer
on
tap
that
i
just
absolutely
love
there
is
almost
a
honey
like
quality
to
the
taste
and
it
is
very
drinkable
when
i
go
somewhere
and
they
have
this
on
tap
i
will
almost
always
have
a
couple
of
pints
i
just
cant
help
myself
overall
i
liked
this
brew
would
have
scored
a
little
higher
if
the
bitterness
was
toned
down
pours
darker
goldenamber
in
color
with
a
large
head
that
cascades
down
to
a
1finger
white
creamy
head
due
from
the
widget
inside
the
can
spotty
lacing
is
seen
which
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
grains
but
not
much
else
really
the
taste
starts
out
very
smooth
with
the
mild
creamy
head
from
the
widget
followed
by
grains
and
yeast
actually
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
perfect
carbonation
of
this
one
overall
its
a
good
brew
overall
pretty
average
and
simple
epa
nitro
can
is
cool
though
o
if
its
on
draft
and
its
happy
hour
have
one
this
is
certainly
not
an
awful
tasting
brew
all
the
components
come
across
so
lightly
that
the
end
result
feels
just
slightly
thicker
and
more
flavorful
than
water
this
is
a
meh
beer
basically
i
dont
hate
it
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
if
i
went
to
a
friends
house
and
he
was
like
sorry
bruh
all
i
got
is
boddingtons
i
would
drink
it
still
lol
a
nice
cream
ale
some
off
notes
in
its
taste
i
wouldnt
be
against
having
this
again
but
since
then
ive
had
better
cream
ales
i
like
this
beer
it
isnt
complicated
and
does
what
it
was
intended
to
do
be
a
cream
ale
which
is
light
and
smooth
and
simply
refreshing
it
has
good
color
and
smell
and
its
great
in
the
summer
when
you
dont
want
a
lager
and
on
top
of
all
that
i
like
their
little
do
dad
in
the
can
because
it
works
done
nitrocan
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
at
neighborhood
pub
a
light
bronze
tealike
color
with
a
pinkish
cast
with
the
tobeexpected
creamy
rich
head
from
the
nitropour
mechanism
this
brew
gets
mentioned
frequently
as
a
classic
example
of
an
easydrinking
but
now
thoroughly
commercialized
english
pale
ale
and
that
does
about
sum
it
up
aroma
is
subtle
and
initially
difficult
to
discern
although
one
does
get
some
tinny
caramel
malt
and
musty
floral
hops
after
a
few
good
sniffs
palate
starts
with
chalky
sweet
grains
and
sharper
than
expected
goldings
hop
eventually
progressing
to
a
more
tannic
grain
and
metallic
flavor
that
becomes
quite
pervasive
some
peach
and
perfumed
tea
flavor
notes
remain
somewhere
in
the
stew
but
the
overall
metal
and
grain
impression
is
difficult
to
shake
thin
bodied
and
very
light
maybe
a
wee
bit
thicker
than
a
canned
bitter
like
tetleys
with
the
expected
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
bubbles
finishes
faintly
earthy
and
floral
but
again
the
main
taste
is
astringent
and
somewhat
sour
because
of
this
i
cannot
really
see
myself
sessioning
this
in
true
english
pub
fashion
overall
this
beer
is
slightly
better
than
average
but
not
much
its
very
light
in
character
and
body
but
the
grains
and
caramel
malts
play
well
together
cb
is
where
im
at
on
boddingtons
pub
ale
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
special
a
league
above
many
american
macro
brews
but
still
a
good
refreshing
session
beer
on
a
warm
day
with
friends
overall
certainly
a
respectable
beer
and
one
id
choose
over
most
domestic
macros
in
the
states
but
not
at
the
level
of
an
artisan
beer
taste
follows
the
nose
husky
herbal
earthy
and
with
a
bit
of
bitter
in
the
finish
i
looked
hard
for
any
metallic
quality
and
could
not
find
any
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
from
the
nitro
and
it
is
a
surprise
if
you
are
not
expecting
it
i
did
feel
that
the
beer
was
a
bit
thin
but
not
really
bland
and
the
grass
and
herbal
although
not
fruity
offered
plenty
of
flavor
and
texture
just
a
touch
of
diacetyl
in
this
to
remind
you
of
popcorn
goes
to
the
finish
dry
and
with
more
grass
and
a
moderate
bitter
husky
earthy
grainy
grassy
pungent
and
herbal
in
short
on
a
cool
autumn
afternoon
i
doubt
very
much
that
one
could
find
a
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
cream
ale
available
in
any
store
in
america
for
such
a
low
price
put
aside
your
prejudices
that
every
good
beer
must
have
the
exact
characteristics
of
pliny
the
elder
and
try
to
enjoy
a
distinctly
british
style
of
traditional
workingmans
ale
on
its
own
merits
i
think
youll
be
pleasantly
surprised
easy
to
knock
back
smooth
and
refreshing
i
tried
this
beer
from
a
nitrocan
poured
into
a
mug
it
had
a
good
head
about
a
12
inch
thick
looked
great
but
was
all
smoke
and
mirrors
its
like
someone
got
a
can
and
scooped
some
lake
water
into
a
can
this
was
an
awful
beer
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
innocuous
in
the
way
that
we
thought
newcastle
was
definitely
nothing
at
all
of
the
extra
bitekick
of
something
like
hobgoblin
d
very
very
bad
dont
waste
your
time
so
many
better
beers
to
enjoy
yep
overall
enjoyable
just
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
and
definitely
not
as
good
as
it
looks
still
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
the
most
unique
aspects
of
this
brew
are
its
aroma
and
flavor
the
nose
is
extremely
minerally
lots
of
metallic
overtones
that
look
over
the
biscuity
malt
aromas
slightly
perfumey
floral
with
a
strong
herbal
scent
near
the
end
taste
is
very
sharp
musty
maybe
some
corn
adjuncts
biscuity
minerally
and
very
chewy
almost
lightly
skunky
like
a
bottle
thats
been
light
struck
except
that
this
was
poured
from
a
can
extremely
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
feels
like
a
nitro
poured
draft
beer
very
different
from
the
american
ales
i
am
used
to
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
boddingtons
is
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
in
its
class
but
its
a
classic
pub
ale
nonetheless
i
would
buy
it
again
not
my
favorite
but
given
a
limited
selection
and
being
in
the
mood
i
would
drink
it
its
strange
it
is
hoppy
but
it
does
by
linger
at
all
not
bitter
but
not
sweet
darker
gold
color
for
such
a
light
flavor
really
nice
packaging
and
advertising
the
can
likes
to
say
import
on
it
this
one
is
fairly
easy
locate
and
it
is
too
bad
it
isnt
better
nice
appearance
with
a
large
foamy
head
and
a
pleasant
yellow
hue
taste
is
simply
mediocre
to
poor
tastes
like
some
macro
concoction
with
offputting
flavours
nothing
really
in
common
with
a
real
english
bitter
nice
marketing
though
thank
you
drinkability
though
nothing
spectacular
i
like
it
it
is
unpretentious
the
packaging
is
attractive
its
appearance
is
inviting
and
it
makes
for
light
and
easy
drinking
on
a
beautiful
and
cool
july
evening
i
was
unpleasantly
surprised
by
how
much
this
tasted
like
a
lesscarbonated
bud
light
the
darughtology
is
a
definite
gimmick
and
although
the
beer
pours
with
a
medium
head
and
has
a
gold
look
and
creamy
feel
it
definitely
lacks
real
substance
and
is
a
forgettable
experience
i
suppose
you
could
cut
open
the
can
and
you
would
have
a
pretty
decent
dreidel
to
play
with
but
thats
where
the
interesting
characteristics
of
this
beer
end
over
all
i
would
say
it
is
smooth
a
little
light
on
taste
for
a
dark
beer
but
very
drinkable
leaves
you
wanting
a
little
more
bite
pours
easy
with
a
classic
head
that
remains
there
until
the
last
sip
my
friend
from
the
cz
really
liked
that
something
the
europeans
like
i
guess
without
going
into
a
lot
of
colorful
words
it
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
sit
around
at
a
pub
with
friends
and
drink
all
night
goes
good
with
pizza
fish
chips
and
nachos
enjoy
this
was
an
import
that
sung
out
to
me
from
the
racks
of
wegmans
sadly
my
instinct
failed
me
this
isnt
bad
and
i
like
it
more
than
standard
american
adjunct
lager
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
in
most
instances
2
55
overall
its
drinkable
but
really
not
that
enjoyable
and
it
tastes
cheap
much
better
ones
out
there
than
this
overall
i
am
not
to
crazy
about
english
pale
ales
its
pretty
sweet
i
prefer
the
american
counterpart
overall
aive
lived
in
england
and
i
guess
i
just
dont
like
english
beer
this
however
isnt
even
available
in
the
uk
as
its
their
export
version
very
watered
down
and
the
mouthfeel
is
horrendously
absent
but
the
subtle
banana
and
cream
flavors
creep
through
to
make
something
about
this
beer
enjoyable
this
beer
is
a
really
creamy
beer
the
appearance
is
perfect
i
ve
never
see
a
beer
from
can
appear
like
just
poured
from
a
pub
tap
taste
is
a
bit
weak
for
the
tipe
of
beer
but
terrific
if
consedered
that
is
in
can
really
good
i
will
fdefinetly
buy
again
o
if
youre
looking
for
a
sessionable
ale
with
decent
presentation
and
a
nonoffensive
taste
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
oi
havent
had
a
ton
of
english
pale
ales
but
i
can
tell
this
falls
a
bit
short
from
there
it
becomes
an
extremely
one
dimensional
beer
not
much
aroma
pale
malts
and
a
little
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
virtually
nonexistent
and
leaves
a
metallic
aftertaste
other
than
the
thick
creamy
head
this
feels
flat
and
watery
wouldnt
get
again
o
this
beer
would
problay
fall
flat
if
not
for
the
nirto
can
its
pretty
basic
with
a
strange
metal
malt
flavor
most
of
ur
bmcers
would
problay
get
turned
off
by
but
i
see
what
flavor
this
is
here
and
for
the
style
is
pretty
good
all
in
all
i
enjoy
boddingtons
as
it
is
one
of
the
few
decent
english
beers
i
can
get
on
tap
in
southern
california
this
is
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
ale
that
will
stay
on
my
list
of
great
beers
four
times
out
of
five
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
when
there
arent
any
specialty
beers
available
while
were
on
the
subject
they
need
to
bring
caffreys
back
to
the
us
boddingtons
is
a
terrifically
easy
and
refreshing
beer
to
drink
for
almost
any
occasionthough
it
is
particularly
wellsuited
for
colder
weather
o
goes
down
extremely
easy
though
it
could
serve
as
one
i
dont
see
it
as
a
session
beer
for
me
not
quite
enough
to
hold
my
interest
probably
best
paired
with
a
meal
rather
than
drank
on
its
own
however
i
did
not
have
the
same
impression
when
i
have
had
boddies
from
the
nitro
can
i
thought
it
hat
a
somewhat
bitter
and
chemical
after
taste
not
pleasant
at
all
in
fact
i
think
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
are
both
flat
there
really
arent
many
redeeming
qualities
that
i
like
about
this
beer
i
can
session
it
and
its
not
horrible
but
i
most
likely
given
a
choice
would
drink
something
else
if
someone
gave
them
to
me
for
free
id
do
a
handstand
and
sing
gilligans
island
like
i
would
for
any
free
beer
o
if
the
taste
wasnt
watered
down
and
subdued
this
would
be
fantastic
as
it
stands
its
a
good
session
ale
that
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
looks
nearly
perfect
sometimes
thats
all
i
need
o
the
taste
is
lighter
than
the
color
its
ok
but
not
a
standout
im
trying
different
styles
to
decide
what
to
brew
for
the
summer
and
this
is
the
first
bitter
ive
tasted
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
favorite
style
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy
white
smooth
nitro
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
fruit
and
very
mild
toffee
the
flavor
is
malty
and
quite
fruity
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
the
bosy
could
be
a
bit
thocker
nothing
super
special

i
dont
think
the
nitro
aspect
of
this
beer
enhances
it
in
any
way
it
just
feels
watery
to
me
and
that
doesnt
help
the
buttery
popcorn
kernel
flavor
going
on
potential
is
there
but
it
just
doesnt
work
out
for
me
boddingtons
is
part
of
my
effort
to
review
the
least
interesting
beer
ever
and
i
may
have
succeeded
its
something
that
even
a
turn
of
the
century
librarian
would
find
too
bland
i
cant
imagine
a
situation
in
which
id
willingly
want
to
drink
this
beer
unless
youre
the
type
to
be
distracted
by
cat
toys
youll
likely
feel
the
same
overall
unfortunately
this
beers
high
point
was
the
pour
for
such
an
impressive
looking
beverage
it
came
up
short
in
a
big
way
like
the
2012
usc
trojans
good
looking
no
substance
absolutely
awful
beer
not
recommended
for
anyone
i
ended
up
having
to
drain
pour
it
and
that
doesnt
happen
often
o
not
special
i
like
nitrocans
though
love
the
mouthfeel
and
the
head
flavor
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
like
to
drink
it
when
i
want
something
a
bit
lighter
even
my
best
friend
likes
it
and
she
does
not
typically
like
beer
she
said
it
is
a
better
alternative
to
budbud
light
basically
its
my
goto
for
something
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
different
take
on
the
english
ordinary
bitter
and
one
that
i
really
like
the
hop
notes
are
pleasant
but
offset
wonderfully
by
the
cream
sweet
maltiness
im
sure
my
rating
is
going
to
be
significantly
higher
than
the
average
but
i
really
believe
this
is
an
underappreciated
beer
i
like
boddingtons
and
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
about
it
pours
a
nice
nitro
powered
cream
color
from
the
can
but
it
does
its
thing
much
faster
than
a
guinness
with
the
whole
cascade
process
lasting
just
a
few
seconds
it
settles
into
a
nice
honey
colored
liquid
with
an
inch
or
so
of
foamy
white
head
the
nose
is
pretty
basic
and
frankly
quite
bland
some
english
pale
malts
and
thats
about
it
flavor
is
light
and
balanced
low
alcohol
and
perfect
for
sessioning
kind
of
tastes
like
a
pancake
love
the
mouthfeel
on
this
the
most
it
foesnt
have
much
carbonation
almost
like
a
cask
pour
except
that
its
cold
its
real
smooth
and
milky
in
texture
i
could
drink
these
all
day
i
know
its
nothing
too
exciting
in
terms
of
flavor
but
its
a
classic
beer
in
my
world
bought
this
beer
about
a
week
ago
pours
nicely
from
the
can
into
the
pint
glass
and
produces
a
great
head
that
last
the
entire
time
in
the
glass
goes
down
really
well
and
i
can
taste
a
little
honeybutterscotch
in
the
aftertaste
all
in
all
i
think
its
a
good
brew
other
than
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
beer
nothing
great
going
on
just
a
simple
session
ale
it
feels
light
and
slick
with
diacetyl
coming
through
o
if
you
love
malt
then
this
beer
is
for
you
creamy
caramel
toffee
no
bitterness
at
all
drinkability
is
high
from
a
sessionability
perspective
there
is
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
yet
light
enough
to
not
fatigue
the
palate
better
than
i
ever
remebering
those
cans
tasting
at
home
pours
a
medium
amber
big
creamy
nitro
head
settles
in
too
quickly
scent
is
very
pale
caramel
malts
light
nuttyness
and
some
stale
earthy
and
grassy
hop
notes
taste
has
notable
slightly
stale
earthy
hop
presence
with
mildly
sweet
and
nutty
caramel
malts
faint
fruityness
medium
bodied
nitro
seems
to
settle
out
quickly
solid
highly
drinkable
ale
its
very
mild
drinks
more
like
milk
than
beer
i
can
see
how
someone
who
prefers
a
more
flavorful
beverage
would
dislike
like
beer
still
its
not
anything
to
scoff
at
its
drinkable
and
mildly
enjoyable
i
doubt
ill
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
but
i
wont
cringe
if
offered
a
glass
of
boddingtons
pub
ale
you
could
probably
pass
on
this
one
but
i
dont
think
it
deserves
the
scathing
reviews
it
has
gotten
final
thoughts
i
can
understand
why
this
beer
isnt
highly
rated
but
i
think
it
deserves
credit
for
being
very
unique
at
least
for
those
of
us
who
live
in
the
us
it
would
be
the
perfect
session
beer
for
an
evening
in
a
british
pub
although
it
doesnt
have
much
flavor
to
offer
there
is
nothing
off
about
the
taste
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
color
with
the
perfect
long
lasting
head
scent
is
sweet
with
malts
with
some
hints
of
grain
taste
is
light
almost
like
it
lighter
than
water
has
this
cheap
grain
taste
while
having
a
bitter
crispness
to
it
it
finishes
with
a
chalky
malt
after
taste
not
my
kind
of
beer
by
any
means
overall
i
know
many
like
to
blast
this
beer
for
being
bland
but
i
find
it
to
be
very
refreshing
and
balanced
despite
being
quite
mild
from
what
i
remember
the
nitro
cans
are
also
good
but
not
as
good
as
having
it
on
nitrotap
happy
to
finally
review
this
as
i
used
to
have
it
often
in
my
prereview
days
had
on
tap
poured
into
a
shaker
glass
decent
creamy
offwhite
head
with
ok
lacing
slight
floral
citrus
aroma
mostly
malty
though
creamy
texture
with
a
malty
taste
some
hops
were
present
but
i
didnt
think
that
they
balanced
the
sweetness
the
way
i
like
it
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
the
beer
and
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
sure
that
it
measured
up
to
the
hype
maybe
its
me
o
inoffensive
and
bland
slightly
better
on
tap
but
thats
not
saying
much
overall
an
ok
english
session
ale
decent
flavor
good
for
what
it
is
500ml
can
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
amber
with
a
small
white
lasting
head
aroma
and
taste
is
of
light
grains
fruity
with
some
light
biscuit
malt
palate
is
a
light
body
with
very
light
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
light
biscuit
malt
grainy
light
fruity
notes
flavor
and
aroma
is
a
bit
flat
as
well
as
the
carbonation
overall
an
ok
brew
not
much
else
pours
golden
brown
with
an
abundance
of
creamy
head
plenty
of
retention
on
the
head
and
the
clinging
frothy
lace
lasted
and
lasted
a
distinctly
malty
nose
with
a
touch
of
roast
to
compliment
mild
and
malty
with
a
semidry
finish
definitely
a
beer
meant
for
sessioning
but
not
too
bad
for
what
it
is
my
friend
brought
a
4
pack
over
to
a
very
drunken
game
of
pool
and
really
talked
this
stuff
up
the
can
looked
so
inviting
with
its
bright
yellow
color
and
the
name
made
me
think
it
was
going
to
taste
something
like
that
beer
stuff
in
harry
potter
it
poured
with
a
beautiful
bubbly
head
and
from
across
the
room
looked
very
appetizing
as
i
went
over
to
claim
my
pint
i
thought
someone
might
have
shit
themselves
when
suddenly
i
realized
the
beer
smelled
like
fking
puke
poured
it
down
the
drain
and
then
poured
wet
cement
down
the
drain
to
make
sure
it
wouldnt
come
back
up
not
sure
if
maybe
they
were
just
ancient
stock
from
publix
or
what
but
oh
god
it
was
terrible
o
that
lingering
soapy
bitterness
is
a
little
distracting
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
especially
given
its
popularly
too
light
almost
watery
with
some
offflavours
naah
i
love
this
beer
as
a
light
drinking
with
friends
beer
not
too
sophisticated
just
pleasant
drinking
it
has
a
creamy
feel
with
a
great
flavour
one
cannot
expect
a
stout
or
a
belgian
style
flavour
from
this
ale
rather
expect
simple
and
clean
beer
taste
everything
about
this
beer
is
pretty
solid
except
how
it
tastes
and
smells
its
metallic
and
off
putting
sweet
and
grainy
thin
and
watery
this
a
very
poor
example
of
the
style
ignore
this
is
a
fullbodied
ale
but
very
smooth
and
refreshing
the
can
produces
a
lot
of
head
but
its
part
of
the
experience
serve
very
cold
either
alone
or
with
hearty
foods
such
as
steaks
or
other
meats
on
the
grill
this
beer
has
the
ultimate
draught
can
it
only
pales
in
comparison
to
the
real
thing
on
tap
this
is
my
absolute
favorite
beer
its
as
smooth
and
refreshing
as
a
cool
glass
of
water
on
a
hot
day
but
full
and
rich
as
any
quality
brewed
pale
ale
this
beer
is
my
standard
a
light
bodied
ale
that
has
a
little
stale
feel
to
it
not
my
taste
not
as
good
as
bass
and
no
way
near
as
good
as
sam
smiths
o
my
only
disappointment
is
the
smell
everything
else
is
well
done
i
would
have
this
again
as
long
as
im
not
forced
to
smell
it
not
like
that
would
do
anything
because
theres
nothing
there
o
nothing
crazy
a
simple
pale
ale
let
me
begin
by
saying
i
am
not
a
super
fan
of
british
ales
with
the
exception
of
bitters
take
that
in
mind
when
reading
this
review
this
is
one
of
the
sexiest
pours
i
have
ever
seen
from
a
lighter
brew
even
with
an
experienced
pour
the
head
will
consume
nearly
34
of
the
glass
and
quickly
roll
up
the
glass
into
a
uber
creamy
2
finger
head
this
creamy
head
sticks
around
the
nose
is
slight
but
includes
bananas
and
some
malt
the
taste
is
a
disappointment
from
such
an
attractive
pour
its
a
little
watery
with
notes
of
bananas
and
very
mild
floral
hops
i
enjoy
the
creamy
mouth
feel
and
the
brew
isnt
bad
its
actually
very
drinkable
but
its
lacking
in
complexity
and
i
wish
it
were
more
robust
all
that
said
i
honestly
have
a
similar
view
when
drinking
most
standard
british
pub
ales
at
least
this
one
pours
sexy
and
has
a
cool
mouth
feel
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
overall
really
the
only
thing
this
brew
has
is
a
decent
smell
and
look
the
breadiness
was
nice
but
the
herbal
and
astringent
flavors
really
took
away
from
it
and
as
for
its
mouthfeel
a
nonnitrogen
driven
nature
may
have
suited
the
flavors
better
overall
not
the
best
beer
but
not
the
worsed
the
letdown
of
flavors
really
isnt
cool
but
had
you
never
seen
the
pour
and
had
a
closepin
over
your
nose
when
drank
the
beers
flavor
isnt
suffering
just
nothing
too
standout
about
that
this
beer
tastes
watery
build
the
feel
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
creaminess
its
slightly
drying
on
the
back
end
and
slightly
bitter
good
going
down
if
not
great
tasting
gross
flat
and
bizarre
im
not
a
fan
not
much
in
the
aroma
but
faintly
sweet
beer
itself
is
creamy
and
mild
super
high
drinkability
no
off
flavors
and
the
nitrocream
texture
goes
well
with
the
mild
flavor
and
while
the
balance
is
good
theres
hardly
any
flavor
there
still
could
be
worse
its
not
getting
any
better
as
it
warms
unfortunately
im
glad
this
was
a
gift
to
put
it
plainly
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
seems
like
any
basic
american
pilsner
or
lager
just
not
a
whole
lot
too
it
other
than
appearance
this
is
a
great
aesthetic
beer
but
a
poor
drinking
beer
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
great
product
to
get
a
person
in
to
better
beer
but
it
still
leaves
much
to
be
desired
i
do
remember
it
being
more
palatable
on
nitrotap
until
then
2
5
smells
and
tastes
like
an
american
lager
with
just
a
touch
of
fruitiness
uninspired
and
piss
poor
for
an
english
pale
aletotally
lacking
in
any
malt
hop
or
yeast
based
points
of
complexity
o
i
think
boddingtons
has
its
place
as
a
beer
to
drink
at
the
pub
on
a
warm
summer
day
its
cheap
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
good
enough
but
i
think
compared
to
other
cheaper
brews
it
falls
far
short
on
flavor
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
its
been
imported
and
didnt
survive
the
trip
though
i
wont
be
able
to
say
until
i
make
another
trip
over
to
the
uk
and
try
it
ontap
2
0
o
over
all
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
prefer
a
unique
feel
and
taste
in
my
beer
however
after
drinking
the
four
pack
of
draught
cans
i
had
no
strong
desire
to
drink
anymore
as
the
creamy
flavor
really
became
over
whelming
the
beer
is
not
great
not
terrible
just
good
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
overall
45
not
my
favorite
tasting
beer
but
i
respect
it
in
its
style
and
what
it
lacks
in
taste
is
well
made
up
for
with
all
other
categories
overall
a
simple
drinkable
beer
not
very
memorable
or
something
id
look
forward
to
drinking
again
o
a
nice
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
thats
about
the
only
redeeming
qualities
here
this
beer
adjuncts
abound
a
struggle
to
finish
i
have
craft
beer
drinking
friends
that
enjoy
this
one
maybe
i
am
missing
something
d
i
could
pound
this
it
doesnt
carry
the
profile
for
appreciating
at
a
sit
down
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
is
something
that
i
could
see
me
picking
up
on
gameday
to
pound
i
just
love
boddingtons
on
nitro
tap
clear
straw
with
a
creamy
white
head
and
mild
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
soft
silken
mouthfeel
soft
hay
notes
apricots
mild
bitterness
and
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
its
not
a
flavor
bomb
nor
is
it
supposed
to
be
its
a
very
sessionable
english
pale
and
in
that
it
succeeds
in
droves
iv
only
had
this
beer
on
tap
its
pale
yellow
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
to
it
pours
similar
to
guiness
and
it
seems
to
taste
better
if
you
let
it
settle
after
they
give
you
the
pint
a
little
oily
and
just
a
bit
bitter
it
doesnt
finish
as
crisp
as
id
like
but
it
has
that
classic
english
feel
and
taste
just
grab
the
darts
and
a
pint
of
this
and
your
golden
i
purchase
this
beer
after
the
holidays
in
january
and
consume
it
through
early
spring
i
will
report
back
later
with
a
more
detailed
definitive
review
of
this
beer
i
wasnt
that
big
of
a
fan
of
this
beer
especially
as
the
beer
went
on
o
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
i
have
had
bodddingtons
in
a
can
and
had
thought
not
that
much
of
it
when
i
had
it
off
tap
i
was
very
impressed
it
pours
very
nice
and
has
a
great
pale
yellow
color
it
has
a
very
nice
head
to
it
very
creamy
it
taste
bitter
like
you
would
expect
but
has
a
very
nice
creamyness
to
it
the
only
down
side
i
found
is
how
low
its
abv
is
it
could
have
a
bit
more
bitterness
too
i
think
this
beer
is
a
very
good
intro
bitter
beer
if
you
have
not
had
a
lot
of
bitter
beers
o
the
beer
was
not
hard
to
drink
that
being
said
i
did
not
find
much
to
praise
in
it
o
not
impressive
but
would
be
a
pretty
fun
session
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
english
pale
the
taste
is
good
but
pretty
simple
overall
pretty
good
a
little
strong
for
drinking
all
day
one
or
two
at
a
time
is
ok
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
a
surprisingly
easy
drinker
for
the
full
bodied
mouthfeel
definitely
recommended
it
gets
extra
points
because
it
is
best
you
can
get
in
a
can
at
the
711
near
my
apartment
if
you
havent
planned
and
need
a
reasonable
beer
last
minute
boddingtons
will
make
you
happy
overall
understandably
a
classic
pub
ale
for
its
texture
and
smoothness
not
much
depth
but
that
is
not
what
you
look
for
in
a
boddingtons
overall
a
very
interesting
ale
undeniably
smooth
yet
also
undeniably
lacking
full
flavor
i
can
certainly
see
why
some
people
like
it
so
much
but
i
think
i
will
stick
with
my
heavier
ales
overall
a
very
average
brew
with
some
odd
nuances
food
pairing
i
would
say
butter
bc
it
just
taste
so
bready
but
in
all
seriousness
maybe
something
spicy
since
the
beer
is
malty
and
bready
so
maybe
like
a
crawfish
etouffee
i
was
hoping
for
more
hear
and
it
seemed
like
a
better
idea
than
it
actually
was
oh
well
i
tried
body
is
brownish
amberorange
in
color
topped
by
a
creamy
head
from
the
nitro
widget
no
lacing
earthy
light
esters
and
a
slight
metallic
note
characterize
the
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
though
some
biscuity
malts
do
come
through
in
the
flavor
creamy
on
the
palate
as
one
would
expect
from
nitro
my
main
beef
is
that
this
beer
is
very
onedimensional
in
that
the
metallic
yeast
notes
really
overwhelm
anything
else
that
i
can
discern
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
is
far
from
being
a
good
example
of
an
english
ale
make
sure
this
beer
isnt
drank
ice
cold
as
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
at
a
warmer
temperature
o
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
pretty
darn
good
if
you
like
english
pale
ales
this
one
is
readily
available
and
a
solid
option
nitro
beers
suck
solid
not
must
have
t
a
light
flavor
hops
are
dominatei
get
a
tiny
but
of
malt
in
the
background
o
not
outstanding
by
any
means
but
a
comfortable
choice
for
a
casual
social
drink
which
is
most
likely
exactly
what
it
was
intended
for
overall
once
upon
a
time
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
i
must
have
fallen
for
the
nitro
mouthfeel
as
a
substitute
for
taste
because
this
beer
is
really
not
that
good
one
problem
with
nitro
is
that
it
seems
to
leave
a
gaping
whole
in
the
flavor
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
pours
a
clear
light
brown
with
a
1
inch
solid
creamy
offwhite
head
that
lasts
foamy
patches
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
subdued
with
some
maltgrain
and
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
with
nutty
and
fruity
flavors
and
some
citrus
zest
on
the
finish
a
mild
bitterness
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
from
the
nitro
tap
but
has
a
nice
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
on
nitro
tap
but
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
from
the
nitrocan
when
i
have
tried
it
in
the
past
on
a
second
tasting
i
tried
it
warm
never
in
fridge
and
it
was
an
improvement
barely
so
if
you
like
warm
flat
beer
this
is
for
you
overall
for
me
there
is
no
other
beer
quite
like
it
this
can
comes
with
a
widget
which
results
in
that
excellent
creamy
silky
head
its
refreshing
crisp
and
satisfying
the
spice
really
shows
in
this
beer
average
on
the
alcohol
side
these
go
down
easy
and
smooth
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
do
yourself
the
favor
and
go
ahead
o
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
its
decent
and
very
close
to
sub
par
it
doesnt
benefit
from
being
poured
into
a
glass
i
actually
prefer
it
from
the
can
to
be
honest
i
havent
seen
a
beer
truly
benefit
from
the
whole
nitrocan
widget
hype
my
rating
may
be
too
generous
i
defiantly
wouldnt
recommend
this
is
close
to
being
called
beer
pong
beer
o
overall
a
terrible
beer
in
my
opinion
a
few
of
my
buddies
liked
it
claiming
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
as
the
label
described
planning
to
give
it
another
shot
stay
thirsty
my
friends
this
is
always
a
go
to
session
beer
for
me
pretty
straightforward
with
a
good
creamy
style
to
it
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
it
does
provide
some
good
flavor
at
a
low
abv
dr
easy
to
drink
but
pricey
that
said
id
have
it
again
theres
a
pleasant
body
to
this
as
well
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
it
retains
its
head
as
it
warms
and
each
sip
gives
you
a
foam
mustache
starts
out
sweet
but
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
dry
with
something
that
reminds
me
in
my
limited
knowledge
of
vino
of
a
white
wine
light
flavorful
and
highly
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
that
has
enough
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
the
glass
and
also
make
it
very
sessionable
also
the
appearance
once
poured
is
really
something
to
see
id
drink
this
again
anytime
not
the
least
complex
nitro
ale
ive
ever
had
its
plenty
drinkable
and
moderately
tasty
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
dont
regret
trying
it
and
i
might
get
it
again
but
it
definitely
wont
be
a
priority
worth
a
try
if
you
love
nitro
beer
but
otherwise
its
probably
something
to
pass
on
imagine
a
golden
light
copper
colored
beer
that
is
creamy
like
guinness
but
no
black
coffee
tastesmellappearance
o
i
do
like
the
looks
and
the
color
of
the
beer
is
very
nice
for
the
price
its
decent
but
there
are
better
offers
for
around
the
same
price
point
i
wouldnt
refuse
but
also
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
one
either
overall
its
not
awful
and
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
i
would
take
it
over
a
lot
of
other
beers
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
i
do
think
the
can
looks
pretty
cool
though
and
has
a
classic
look
to
it
overall
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
the
only
reason
why
i
woudl
buy
it
again
is
the
cheap
price
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
definitely
good
pub
beer
i
believe
that
if
i
had
this
beer
on
cask
i
might
be
in
love
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
appealing
english
pale
ale
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
know
that
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
and
if
the
cask
could
deliver
that
i
think
this
would
be
the
benchmark
for
these
socalled
cream
ales
od
it
was
ok
didnt
taste
much
like
anything
but
it
kept
me
entertained
while
russian
football
was
on
the
creaminess
is
a
little
over
the
top
and
it
lacks
flavour
a
dirty
yellowgolden
color
but
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
that
is
extremely
creamy
light
grainy
aroma
along
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
a
faint
sourness
thick
creamy
body
but
a
light
flavor
honey
and
caramel
malt
flavors
come
through
but
finishes
dry
and
with
some
earthy
sourness
the
most
impressive
thing
about
the
beer
is
the
creamy
body
made
from
the
nitro
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
the
8
for
a
four
pack
the
taste
was
extremely
light
not
impressive
and
not
really
packing
much
of
anything
just
light
little
bits
of
floral
and
fruit
it
was
refreshing
given
the
heat
flavor
is
mild
all
the
way
and
even
watery
ill
give
it
points
for
being
creamy
and
smooth
this
beer
goes
down
like
heavy
water
it
is
slick
and
watery
a
little
more
carbonation
would
go
a
long
way
here

this
is
one
of
those
fun
beers
to
get
again
every
so
often
simply
for
me
because
of
the
nitro
characteristics
you
told
yourself
when
you
fill
up
your
handbag
but
not
strong
or
intense
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
start
the
night
with
dark
orangey
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
i
mean
a
part
of
me
wants
to
say
that
this
smells
good
because
it
does
smell
creamy
and
honeyy
which
i
know
is
common
in
nitro
beers
as
well
no
flaws

im
just
not
a
fan
of
nitrocan
beers
i
find
them
way
too
watery
and
hate
the
feel
to
them
about
the
only
good
thing
about
them
is
the
appearance
of
the
beer
which
is
perfect

this

this

that
looks

is

many
update
toward
the
end
of
this
beer
the
flavors
started
to
meld
together
much
better
the
metallic
aftertaste
turned
into
a
somewhat
more
agressive
bitterness
throughout
the
whole
sip
and
was
less
heavy
on
the
laterend
not
sure
if
it
was
warming
up
a
little
or
breathing
a
bit
but
i
think
my
next
pint
ought
to
sit
for
a
few
minutes
before
i
approach
it
drain
pour
never
again
d
the
finish
brought
out
a
wheaty
flavour
with
time
but
never
really
improved
the
taste
this
beer
is
decently
drinkable
if
you
arent
looking
to
have
a
ton
of
flavour
just
something
cold
overall
not
very
impressed
from
the
nitrocan
started
as
a
full
glass
of
thick
creamy
foam
slowly
the
foam
turned
over
from
bottom
to
top
revealing
a
deep
yellow
beer
with
a
steady
halfinch
foamy
white
cap
after
that
everything
went
down
hill
grassy
aromas
with
stale
biscuit
despite
the
dramatic
pour
there
was
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
light
stale
malty
flavors
with
a
very
light
hint
of
pear
and
a
stale
bread
aftertaste
you
could
sit
and
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
put
it
up
against
a
fine
craft
brew
and
it
falls
a
bit
short
on
character
drinkability
its
water
itll
get
down
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
colour
with
thick
white
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
smells
of
mild
floral
hops
with
some
fruity
malt
very
dry
flavour
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
i
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
a
few
years
ago
as
i
started
to
move
to
more
flavourful
beer
still
good
enough
to
drink
now
but
its
just
ok
d
i
think
its
very
drinkable
it
is
the
definition
of
a
beer
that
would
be
nice
to
drink
at
a
party
and
goes
well
with
food
and
snacks
low
abv
means
it
will
fill
you
up
long
before
you
feel
the
effects
its
not
really
a
beer
that
i
would
have
a
craving
for
but
i
could
probably
drink
ten
of
them
d
i
could
tolerate
a
few
of
these
but
not
my
session
pick
d
bitter
without
much
flavor
means
i
only
finished
this
beer
because
i
paid
for
it
this
is
a
highly
drinkablesessionable
brew
that
will
go
down
very
easily
i
wish
the
flavors
were
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
english
pale
ale
drinkability
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
may
be
bitter
enough
to
deter
some
expecting
a
more
hearty
or
hoppy
ale
never
heard
of
this
so
i
picked
one
up
off
the
shelf
at
a
local
shop
a
quick
look
at
my
reviews
will
show
the
reader
that
im
typically
a
pretty
generous
scorer
on
this
site
this
beer
gets
my
first
f
simply
disgusting
i
took
at
small
sip
of
this
and
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
the
can
in
which
this
beer
was
shipped
looks
a
bit
like
motor
oil
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
billing
or
at
least
a
highly
watereddown
version
of
the
same
its
astonishing
to
me
that
this
beer
was
shipped
6
thousand
miles
when
i
would
have
had
a
much
more
satisfying
experience
drinking
the
local
tap
water
drinkability
this
beer
is
highly
drinkablesessionable
but
lacks
much
flavor
not
a
bad
english
pale
ale
but
very
very
average
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
day
but
i
would
definitely
want
something
more
flavorful
and
with
more
character
this
does
taste
like
it
would
be
perfect
with
fish
and
chips
though
drinkability
is
good
though
really
a
decent
beer
though
not
exactly
one
that
id
call
wellcrafted
still
perfectly
drinkable
poured
a
goldenamber
with
very
little
head
or
visible
carbonation
and
poor
lacing
some
pear
and
apple
in
the
nose
but
exceedingly
caramelly
and
malty
the
taste
confirmed
this
very
little
balance
in
the
flavor
with
a
thin
finish
the
feel
overall
was
thin
and
watery
which
im
sure
makes
it
good
for
sessioning
but
the
lack
of
flavor
contradicts
that
maybe
this
beer
has
a
story
or
a
place
in
a
culture
or
scene
that
im
unfamiliar
with
but
in
my
scene
it
has
no
place
dont
really
see
the
point
of
it
and
it
wasnt
worth
my
time
wow
i
was
recently
in
london
and
this
really
reminds
me
of
the
real
ale
i
had
there
different
obviously
but
the
closest
thing
ive
had
that
wasnt
on
cask
bitterness
is
very
low
and
its
super
well
balanced
light
carbonations
and
its
so
hot
that
its
about
cask
temp
malty
adn
slightly
sweet
overall
pretty
decent
i
remember
this
being
a
lot
nicer
remember
there
being
a
nice
honey
quality
to
it
seems
to
be
missing
in
this
batch
pour
is
nitrocan
eye
candy
but
nothing
along
the
lines
of
appealing
after
the
fun
is
over
nose
of
hay
and
a
bit
of
lemon
color
of
hay
the
palate
was
not
as
enjoyable
not
sweet
but
with
a
strange
bitter
quality
that
wasnt
malt
backed
very
one
dimensional
will
have
to
have
maybe
one
more
time
in
the
future
it
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
goes
down
like
water
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
as
long
as
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
taste
is
much
the
same
drinkable
but
slightly
unpleasant
in
all
the
beer
went
down
ok
with
creamy
mouthfeel
and
served
at
refreshing
temperature
but
wont
go
there
again
drinkability
decent
beer
but
probably
will
look
elsewhere
in
the
future
i
was
at
a
irish
bar
will
little
to
choose
from
boddingtons
pours
a
deep
gold
color
the
beer
has
a
very
clean
feel
in
your
mouth
that
is
refreshing
but
this
ale
promises
a
taste
that
it
cannot
deliver
there
is
a
very
good
taste
hiding
in
the
beer
but
it
is
very
subtle
honestly
it
tastes
like
a
light
beer
in
that
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
version
of
a
beer
which
is
disappointing
because
there
is
a
good
refreshing
taste
hiding
there
i
tried
this
beer
on
on
tap
on
may
14
2009
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
goldenbrown
with
a
thick
foamy
longlasting
white
head
out
of
a
can
with
a
widget
the
aroma
was
grainy
malt
some
hops
and
citrusy
notes
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
grainy
malt
and
some
hops
refreshingly
good
but
not
outstanding
o
an
unremarkable
beer
certainly
drinkable
but
there
is
almost
no
character
i
originally
had
this
during
my
boilermaker
days
for
the
beer
passport
deal
over
at
chumleys
i
figured
id
give
it
another
go
now
that
ive
gotten
further
into
the
world
of
beer
it
pours
a
clear
light
orangecopper
bronze
maybe
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
froth
that
stoically
hangs
around
for
quite
some
time
the
nose
is
nearly
objectionable
with
notes
of
funky
wheat
and
corn
coupled
with
bland
puffed
rice
hmm
the
taste
comprises
a
very
blunt
bitterness
kinda
like
hard
water
some
very
light
wheat
and
flowers
i
think
theyre
daisies
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
thickish
milky
feel
man
i
think
i
remember
something
quite
different
definitely
less
objectionable
d
i
was
able
to
keep
drinking
it
but
i
think
only
because
i
didnt
want
to
waste
the
money
i
spent
on
it
eventually
i
kind
of
got
used
to
it
so
ill
just
say
it
was
an
average
drinkability
overall
i
only
bought
this
beer
because
it
was
next
to
the
guinness
at
the
liquor
store
i
was
not
expecting
much
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
boddingtons
pub
ale
was
average
in
appearance
and
smell
but
exceeded
your
average
ales
in
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
try
it
youll
enjoy
it
d
very
drinkable
i
can
drink
this
much
easier
than
i
can
bud
lite
which
apparently
has
superior
drinkability
if
you
believe
everything
that
you
are
told
d
i
have
no
problem
doing
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
notes
i
like
it
for
mixing
with
stouts
when
they
go
flat
it
can
help
resurrect
them
allinall
its
better
than
a
macrolager
but
i
dont
think
its
worth
the
price
d
eh
a
lady
at
work
keeps
giving
these
to
me
as
thankyous
so
i
usually
pass
them
off
to
guests
not
awful
i
think
i
might
prefer
it
non
nitroed
though
poured
from
the
nitro
can
into
my
samuel
smith
pint
glass
after
popping
the
top
on
the
can
in
exploded
all
over
the
coffee
table
so
i
rushed
to
pour
it
slowly
into
the
glass
beautiful
action
moved
quicker
than
off
the
tap
but
still
looked
nice
not
much
on
the
nose
taste
is
much
more
subtle
watery
than
on
tap
hard
to
describe
the
flavor
so
i
wont
this
one
is
all
looks
and
no
substance
for
me
it
has
a
cool
looking
can
and
pours
a
creamy
cascading
head
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
very
thin
though
after
the
initial
creamy
feel
there
is
something
i
like
about
it
it
goes
down
very
easy
i
drank
this
thing
in
about
5
minutes
and
i
was
telling
myself
to
slow
down
and
enjoy
i
will
probably
stick
to
the
draft
version
dont
recommend
in
the
can
especially
if
you
have
white
carpet
boddingtons
in
a
can
would
be
enjoyed
by
those
who
are
sessioning
or
who
want
something
a
little
more
exotic
than
an
american
pale
lager
the
draft
version
like
most
beers
is
preferable
this
beer
is
a
good
session
beer
d
it
is
very
drinkable
although
it
does
fill
you
up
quicker
then
your
average
beer
but
i
can
definitely
say
i
could
drink
this
beer
trough
out
the
evening
so
the
next
time
your
in
the
mood
for
a
real
eye
opener
ask
your
bartender
for
a
boddingtons
pub
ale
and
never
look
back
drinkibility
low
ive
had
this
in
cans
and
now
on
tap
and
there
are
few
differences
i
wont
drink
this
again
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
onefinger
head
that
holds
for
the
count
bright
clarity
with
evident
carbonation
and
phenomenal
lacing
aromas
of
freshly
cut
grass
green
apple
and
biscuit
creamy
velvet
smoothness
in
a
big
way
like
an
elvis
painting
shout
out
to
jeff
opens
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
slight
tang
of
apricot
moves
into
flavors
of
light
biscuit
and
grain
unpleasant
metallic
note
surfaces
subtle
play
of
hops
on
the
back
end
delivers
much
needed
bitterness
as
it
warms
apple
begins
to
reign
finishes
powderdry
with
a
borderline
astringent
quality
as
for
its
session
worthiness
the
cream
of
manchester
offers
unparalleled
poundability
quite
possibly
the
most
highly
evolved
form
of
the
lawnmower
brew
cheers
because
of
the
passivity
this
is
one
to
drink
mugs
of
water
might
be
a
better
choice
its
better
for
you
choose
a
beer
with
some
flavor
o
everything
from
the
pour
to
the
last
sip
is
engaging
about
this
beer
which
which
makes
appealing
to
drink
i
had
the
beer
on
tap
about
a
month
ago
and
really
liked
it
i
picked
up
a
case
of
the
nitro
cans
when
i
opened
the
first
can
it
shot
out
and
overflowed
some
the
second
can
didnt
have
this
problem
as
much
i
poured
it
into
a
guinness
glass
to
drink
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
has
a
good
taste
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
but
in
a
good
way
it
is
a
great
looking
beer
i
will
be
enjoying
this
case
beautiful
pour
from
the
nitro
can
with
the
cool
cascading
effect
nice
silky
white
head
and
deep
golden
color
nose
is
very
very
weak
with
some
cereal
grain
palate
is
almost
flavorless
with
a
faint
malt
flavor
light
watery
body
and
little
to
no
finish
its
like
this
is
just
a
nitro
bmc
or
something
fail
this
is
a
simple
ale
but
a
good
one
for
everyday
a
true
session
beer
imo
a
good
solid
pale
ale
to
drink
when
all
you
want
is
to
quench
your
thirst
not
a
sipper
does
do
her
well
to
sit
there
and
warm
up
better
drink
this
one
fast
and
cold
golden
colored
beer
with
a
slowly
fading
rich
head
aroma
is
grainy
taste
is
creamy
and
also
grainy
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
and
goes
down
very
easy
probably
a
summer
time
beer
since
it
is
very
lager
like
i
would
recommend
and
would
purchase
this
again
the
aroma
is
malty
and
yeast
with
a
bit
of
plastic
and
grass
the
appearance
is
light
amber
with
a
creamy
head
but
not
a
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
bitter
finish
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
overall
this
one
is
not
as
good
the
second
time
as
the
first
i
feel
like
its
got
adjuncts
in
it
of
the
limited
canon
of
my
locallyavailable
ukstyle
pub
sessioners
boddys
sits
somewhere
in
the
middle
not
all
that
huge
on
flavour
but
nothing
off
about
it
either
and
it
slides
down
nice
and
easy
its
also
pretty
well
pretty
in
its
disposition
i
gotta
say
which
doesnt
detract
in
the
least
1
pint
nitro
can
served
at
50
degrees
in
my
sam
smith
tulip
poured
a
translucent
brownishreddish
copper
with
a
creamy
two
inch
bright
white
head
with
excellent
retention
not
much
happening
in
the
nose
cereal
grains
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
is
somewhat
bland
and
watery
and
comes
off
a
little
bit
skunky
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
coming
out
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
and
a
somewhat
flat
character
easy
drinking
session
beer
but
there
are
much
better
session
beers
out
there
any
port
in
a
storm
though
d
good
beer
to
watch
with
a
sports
game
dont
have
to
think
about
what
you
are
tasting
straightforward
everyday
beer
theres
really
not
much
flavor
and
yet
there
is
a
measure
of
drinkability
i
dont
mind
itits
good
even
but
its
pretty
unimpressive
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
to
offer
i
do
think
for
a
nice
hot
day
it
might
be
a
real
nice
departure
from
the
usual
crisp
and
hoppy
beers
goodishnot
great
d
like
glasses
of
water
why
bother
this
is
easily
drinkable
but
not
worth
paying
for
drinkability
i
guess
its
ok
if
youre
willing
to
put
up
with
blandness
all
night
d
pretty
good
from
the
lack
of
carbonation
low
abv
easy
drinking
d
quite
drinkable
because
of
the
balance
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
if
not
creamy
and
definitely
suited
to
a
long
session
just
not
something
i
would
necessarily
choose
unless
it
was
the
least
of
many
evils
pours
clear
autumn
orange
with
a
pillowy
white
head
cream
soda
like
in
the
aroma
maybe
a
lightly
hopped
cream
soda
really
mellow
flavor
a
little
bland
but
the
hops
do
come
in
late
and
offer
a
shot
of
bitterness
if
youre
looking
typical
mouthfeel
for
a
nitrocan
chuggable
though
not
really
desirable
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
sense
that
theres
nothing
to
write
home
about
easy
enough
to
get
down
pours
a
golden
a
colour
with
a
decent
cream
head
smells
of
nothing
in
particularsmells
very
weak
to
be
honest
and
unfortunately
thats
how
it
tastes
too
way
too
watery
for
my
liking
but
its
not
all
bad
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
lots
of
it
i
would
class
this
as
a
beginners
ale
so
if
you
have
started
drinking
ale
and
want
to
build
your
way
up
start
with
this
ale
overall
its
a
mediocre
ale
that
i
would
recommend
to
people
who
dont
like
very
strong
tasting
and
smelling
beers
pours
foamy
like
a
guinness
and
comes
in
the
same
nitro
can
after
the
foam
settles
theres
not
much
carbonation
left
the
first
sip
is
kind
of
a
disappointment
and
it
doesnt
improve
too
much
as
the
glass
empties
bitter
is
definitely
here
but
its
really
a
bit
tart
or
sour
the
foamyflat
thickcreamy
quality
stays
on
your
mind
while
youre
downing
this
one
if
you
like
that
great
but
it
didnt
score
any
major
points
with
me
overall
an
average
tasting
english
bitter
beer
with
a
mediocre
flavor
feel
is
good
coming
from
the
nitro
can
ill
have
to
try
this
on
tap
one
day
and
see
any
differences
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
build
and
lightsubtle
carb
while
i
liked
this
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
ill
hit
it
up
at
my
local
pubdive
good
beer
in
all
a
really
good
english
pale
ale
d
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
if
there
wasnt
any
better
choices
not
as
good
as
i
remember
though
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
the
smell
is
of
light
malty
banana
bread
with
wisps
of
nutmeg
no
one
else
i
know
smells
nutmeg
though
the
taste
is
oh
so
very
mild
and
unchallenging
that
some
may
find
it
boring
i
find
it
comforting
and
lovely
like
a
slightly
slow
old
friend
who
lacks
depth
yet
is
agreeable
with
good
aesthetics
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
certainly
no
challenge
whatsoever
i
love
this
beer
this
is
a
real
disappointment
not
sure
what
went
wrong
here
but
it
seemingly
all
did
really
surprised
how
disappointed
i
was
in
this
one
very
flat
tasting
not
pleasant
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
great
as
well
i
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
after
dinner
to
cap
off
a
meal
nothing
to
heavy
and
very
complementary
due
to
its
nonobective
flavor
nitro
can
pours
amber
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
lasts
the
duration
having
a
hard
time
thinking
of
what
to
say
about
this
one
a
very
average
beer
sweet
with
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
fairly
refreshing
but
i
wouldnt
pay
too
much
for
it
this
can
was
a
freebie
d
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
theres
not
much
to
really
like
about
this
one
cheers
i
guess
leaves
nothing
for
mouthfeel
but
is
drinkable
in
an
unintentional
way
as
a
good
tea
substitute
if
you
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
beer
is
smooth
medium
to
full
bodied
odd
back
of
the
mouth
bitterness
and
a
strong
aftertaste
abbreviates
my
pleasure
with
this
beer
hopefully
my
bad
christmas
weekend
of
terrible
beers
is
nearly
over
d
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
special
but
worth
having
as
a
standby
the
beer
starts
out
as
all
foam
the
foam
slowly
rolls
upward
into
a
thick
white
pancake
a
leaves
a
deep
golden
beer
body
the
smell
is
big
on
the
familiar
floral
yeasty
scents
of
a
pale
ale
the
taste
is
unique
to
my
american
tastebuds
a
short
taste
of
spicy
floral
malts
hit
the
tongue
and
ends
in
an
oily
metallic
taste
im
not
too
big
on
id
like
to
think
that
the
metallic
taste
might
have
more
to
do
with
the
can
the
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
and
is
missing
that
carbonation
bite
ive
learn
to
associate
with
beer
its
also
not
too
thin
and
not
too
thick
the
drinkability
is
manageable
if
you
can
get
over
the
metallic
aftertaste
i
think
this
must
be
a
mainstream
beer
for
our
former
colonial
oppressors
probably
dynamite
on
tap
d
very
mild
and
easy
to
drink
though
the
aftertaste
can
be
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
nothing
special
really
but
not
bad
by
any
means
kind
of
like
a
dumbed
down
english
pale
i
suspect
it
has
gone
this
direction
intentionally
over
the
last
couple
of
decades
d
its
easy
to
drink
bc
its
so
bland
but
i
would
not
seek
this
out
an
buy
it
again
all
around
it
is
a
weak
beer
d
it
is
a
very
easy
drink
drinkability
terrible
i
can
finish
almost
any
beer
but
not
this
one
even
tried
a
second
to
see
if
i
had
a
bad
can
no
carbonation
although
this
beer
isnt
the
best
english
pale
by
a
long
shot
its
very
drinkable
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
imported
options
available
in
the
standard
irish
pub
chain
establishment
an
old
friend
and
a
good
goto
in
a
pinch
not
terrible
in
a
can
either
but
certainly
preferable
on
draught
d
easy
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
really
do
the
little
things
aroma
feel
to
make
this
more
than
an
average
brew
this
beer
is
only
drinkable
considering
i
havent
seen
this
beer
on
tap
anywhere
within
a
9
hour
drive
i
havent
done
an
exhaustive
search
of
the
area
but
im
sure
one
is
forthcoming
notes
this
beer
isnt
great
and
positive
characteristics
it
does
have
seem
to
come
from
the
nitrocan
pity
the
few
beers
in
nitro
cans
that
are
easily
accessible
to
me
arent
that
great
of
beers
its
interesting
to
go
back
every
once
in
a
while
and
redrink
the
old
beers
that
your
palate
stopped
by
at
some
point
in
its
development
i
hate
to
say
that
boddingtons
is
kind
of
like
that
old
friend
that
you
rarely
see
and
you
realize
its
because
you
outgrew
ithim
drinkability
its
not
horrible
but
this
is
not
something
i
think
i
would
get
again
just
an
easy
drinking
ale
creamy
sweet
well
balanced
yes
its
a
touch
watery
and
not
terribly
complex
but
nonetheless
it
is
worth
a
drink
every
once
in
a
while
the
nitro
can
gives
the
perfect
amount
of
head
if
poured
properly
would
be
an
ideal
session
brew
i
only
drink
it
once
in
a
while
though
recommended
d
very
high
this
is
one
of
the
few
reasons
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
every
once
in
a
while
you
can
drink
this
loads
and
it
will
still
taste
about
the
same
definitely
a
session
ale
also
a
good
introduction
for
people
who
have
never
tried
an
ale
d
it
ended
up
being
a
bit
nondescript
leaving
me
with
a
thin
review
i
could
drink
a
bunch
in
a
sitting
but
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
it
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
especially
to
introduce
a
nitropour
pours
a
clear
golden
tan
color
with
a
huge
head
that
settles
to
an
almost
blanket
112
inch
crusty
head
the
smell
was
thin
hops
and
malt
and
spice
its
ok
the
taste
was
to
bitter
for
me
it
was
on
the
metallic
side
with
subdued
malts
spices
and
hop
just
not
alot
going
on
in
this
ale
to
keep
my
interest
in
drinking
very
oftenmaybe
with
some
fish
and
chips
on
a
summer
afternoon
would
be
better
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
clone
this
i
think
id
go
100
maris
otter
mashed
medium
maybe
152
to
154
bittered
to
about
25
or
30
ibus
and
no
flavour
aroma
or
dry
hops
id
use
irish
ale
yeast
fermented
warm
to
produce
a
similar
ester
profile
d
some
good
basic
flavors
and
a
great
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
you
could
definitely
throw
back
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
some
may
be
thrown
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
this
a
great
beer
that
you
sit
and
admire
it
no
it
is
not
but
this
is
one
drinkable
brew
with
a
good
creamy
taste
and
poundable
drinkability
for
the
price
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
that
i
have
no
problem
picking
up
for
a
night
of
beer
drinking
it
is
my
favorite
english
pale
ale
although
i
admit
the
nitro
can
has
a
different
taste
then
off
the
tap
still
worth
a
go
though
d
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
english
pale
ale
with
a
creamier
head
from
the
nitrocan
it
was
fine
with
a
meal
but
i
would
probably
not
just
drink
it
by
itself
this
beer
reminds
me
of
8th
street
ale
from
four
peaks
brewing
company
but
i
enjoy
the
latter
more
d
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
session
beer
i
could
personally
drink
this
for
a
while
i
enjoy
the
creamy
taste
in
addition
i
dont
like
pale
ales
in
general
so
the
fact
that
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
pale
ale
makes
it
enjoyable
this
was
difficult
to
finish
there
was
almost
no
taste
aside
from
the
appearance
this
was
pretty
awful
overall
not
impressed
but
then
again
im
a
spoiled
american
craft
beer
drinker
drinkablilty
is
rather
good
i
could
definitely
see
these
as
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
taste
is
pretty
good
and
the
overall
experience
is
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
very
easy
to
put
down
very
light
can
consume
a
number
of
these
in
one
session
my
overwhelming
impression
is
that
this
is
one
weakass
beer
water
has
considerably
more
flavor
wait
there
is
a
taste
but
it
is
like
dissolving
a
gram
of
sugar
into
a
five
gallon
jug
of
water
it
pours
a
cascade
of
foam
out
of
the
nitro
can
and
quickly
resolves
itself
into
a
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
very
respectable
head
there
is
no
appreciable
aroma
to
the
common
man
mouthfeel
falls
right
into
line
with
taste
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
i
could
detect
no
alcohol
and
could
drink
this
all
day
but
why
would
i
want
to
boddingtons
pub
ale
is
not
so
much
a
drain
pour
as
a
why
bother
it
is
not
however
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
drinkability
i
guess
it
is
the
sweeetness
that
makes
this
popular
but
the
beer
has
so
many
drawbacks
to
my
palate
that
i
dont
know
where
to
begin
d
well
i
like
it
enough
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
its
a
fairly
mediocre
brew
so
i
dont
see
myself
ever
actually
doing
that
when
i
could
get
things
i
like
more
for
less
money
i
will
have
boddingtons
again
suspecting
something
simply
went
terribly
wrong
this
time
but
i
wont
be
expecting
too
much
very
drinkable
i
have
a
feeling
i
could
kick
these
guys
back
all
day
long
taken
in
part
from
my
beer
blog
at
first
the
whole
glass
was
frothy
and
offwhite
after
the
nitro
bubbles
had
a
chance
to
seperate
from
the
beer
i
could
see
the
clear
light
amber
body
and
the
thick
cool
looking
nitro
head
not
much
to
the
smell
or
taste
to
speak
of
pretty
dry
kind
of
has
a
light
medicinalherbal
hoppiness
d
this
was
a
strange
experience
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
i
had
in
a
long
time
the
best
looking
english
pale
ale
ive
ever
had
with
nice
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
falls
flat
when
it
comes
to
smell
and
taste
far
to
week
i
had
no
expectations
when
i
popped
the
can
open
but
i
got
dissapointed
when
i
first
smelled
it
and
then
tasted
it
after
looking
at
something
that
looked
really
great
at
the
pub
watching
a
game
it
would
go
down
but
then
again
what
wouldnt
go
down
in
that
condition
dr
yes
buy
why
i
had
remembered
boddintons
a
pretty
good
perhaps
my
palate
has
improved
over
the
last
couple
of
years
ok
so
it
hasnt
astonished
me
hell
it
hasnt
even
particularly
impressed
me
but
it
has
just
enough
character
to
be
pleasant
and
a
subtle
insinuating
drinkability
thats
hard
to
ignore
this
is
not
great
beer
i
like
english
ales
particularly
nitropressurised
ones
because
theyre
smooth
and
clean
and
a
good
way
to
finish
the
night
but
this
one
has
a
real
mean
streak
to
it
quite
aseptic
and
unpleasant
dquite
drinkable
attributable
mostly
to
its
easy
body
and
the
smoothness
of
the
nitro
can
at
the
same
time
if
youre
looking
for
that
pub
can
feel
why
not
go
to
a
local
brewpub
and
get
some
real
cask
ale
d
goes
down
real
easy
d
pretty
darn
good
i
enjoyed
it
alot
but
its
not
an
everyday
ale
d
a
super
easy
drinker
creamy
dry
and
slightly
sweet
these
go
down
almost
as
easy
as
drinking
water
ridiculously
simple
and
straightforward
but
it
works
d
probably
couldve
had
a
few
more
low
abv
and
relatively
light
body
while
still
having
the
taste
nice
taste
mouthfeel
these
are
so
smooth
and
tasty
the
creamy
head
adds
to
the
smoothness
having
you
crave
more
leading
me
into
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
perfect
for
sitting
at
a
barstool
and
yelling
at
a
west
ham
game
on
tv
its
sad
that
this
brand
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
by
its
parent
company
creamy
like
a
guinness
due
to
the
nitrous
widget
in
the
can
the
ale
itself
is
rather
thin
and
not
very
carbonated
but
get
a
sip
of
that
creamy
nitrous
head
with
every
gulp
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
easily
like
a
better
less
watery
version
of
guinness
first
time
i
had
this
out
of
a
1
pint
can
bought
in
a
4
pack
cracked
this
bad
boy
open
and
it
foamed
on
me
after
a
qick
clean
up
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
mug
it
is
a
nice
amber
color
pour
i
drank
it
a
little
warmer
than
its
suggested
41
degrees
smells
sweet
and
slightly
hoppy
its
a
very
thick
but
not
filling
beer
creamy
for
sure
but
still
drinkable
starts
off
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bite
if
youve
ever
had
honeymoon
imagine
it
much
thicker
but
slightly
sweet
not
bad
but
not
mind
blowing
not
bad
too
try
but
not
worth
coming
back
to
again
and
again
all
in
all
a
good
representation
of
an
english
pale
i
really
liked
the
novelty
of
the
creamy
head
that
it
has
and
the
thicker
body
i
enjoyed
it
wouldnt
mind
making
a
session
of
these
this
brew
may
be
the
easiest
brew
to
drink
i
have
ever
had
that
tastes
very
good
an
absolute
delight
to
drink
the
brew
it
is
a
very
very
sessionable
brew
could
drink
by
the
truck
loads
wow
think
guinness
but
lighter
and
more
appealing
to
the
masses
overall
i
honestly
think
i
would
rather
drink
a
pbr
or
high
life
and
for
me
thats
saying
something
just
not
something
enjoyable
in
this
can
i
would
be
willing
to
give
it
a
try
on
tap
though
when
poured
a
strawish
yellow
with
a
nice
foam
top
a
distinct
aroma
of
malt
nothing
special
same
can
be
said
with
the
taste
nothing
real
complex
thick
enough
to
go
down
well
however
there
is
a
lingering
metallic
aftertaste
that
kind
of
kills
it
tastes
like
really
smooth
nothing
no
really
this
beer
doesnt
tastes
like
anything
i
was
thinking
honey
for
a
second
but
i
think
thats
just
because
the
can
has
a
couple
bees
on
it
its
tasteless
but
damn
its
a
creamy
tastelessness
drinkability
is
average
this
isnt
much
better
than
your
average
grocery
store
beer
selection
id
drink
it
again
but
it
depends
d
very
very
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
a
bad
way
to
spend
the
evening
the
pint
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
was
a
cloudy
blond
creme
until
the
bubbles
settled
to
the
top
overall
a
great
presentation
like
all
other
nitro
taps
smell
of
faint
hop
wisps
leapt
out
of
the
pure
foam
head
and
greeted
my
nose
the
beer
has
a
crispness
that
isnt
present
in
other
pale
ales
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
keeps
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
suppose
the
best
advice
i
could
give
to
a
person
is
to
have
it
on
tap
where
it
performs
as
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
warmer
months
i
have
not
had
the
occasion
to
try
the
canned
version
but
judging
from
the
reviews
i
am
in
no
rush
to
try
i
wish
there
was
more
to
say
about
it
but
this
beer
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
its
possibly
better
off
of
tap
and
i
will
review
it
again
when
i
get
a
chance
to
overall
a
tasty
ale
not
great
but
easily
drinkable
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
large
frothy
head
it
pours
like
guinness
but
is
a
light
amber
color
i
think
it
looks
a
lot
better
than
guinness
i
think
it
is
the
best
looking
beer
out
there
it
got
my
first
5
the
smell
and
taste
are
nothing
spectacular
its
just
a
good
solid
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
u
k
beers
along
with
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
creamy
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
not
bad
at
all
but
also
not
great
i
guess
its
drinkable
in
that
its
not
off
putting
at
all
but
i
wouldnt
have
another
just
because
id
rather
seek
out
a
more
flavorful
option
d
while
the
taste
was
nothing
overwhelming
it
was
still
a
nice
beer
that
could
be
worth
drinking
all
day
hopefully
i
can
get
across
the
pond
one
day
to
try
it
there
i
used
about
6oz
of
my
pint
for
a
cod
batter
and
it
turned
out
remarkable
md
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
water
on
the
tongue
rich
milklike
feel
is
then
off
set
with
an
easy
light
cabonation
to
finish
pub
like
beer
with
heavy
drinking
qualities
definitly
a
dinner
beer
light
and
great
tasting
d
while
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
not
that
great
i
could
for
some
reason
drink
it
all
day
its
not
horrible
and
i
do
prefer
it
to
bmcs
the
only
big
problem
with
drinking
this
all
day
is
the
price
tag
4
cans
for
8
99
nevertheless
the
bee
is
a
british
classic
unique
and
enjoyable
mfd
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
chewy
thick
oily
nice
finish
as
well
not
exactly
my
cup
but
i
can
see
why
people
would
like
this
one
dpretty
drinkable
i
could
probably
drink
of
2
or
3
of
these
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
but
i
think
the
flavor
of
this
beer
would
get
boring
to
me
after
a
while
for
myself
this
is
a
good
session
beer
at
4
7
and
very
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
summers
day
before
i
started
drinking
these
types
of
beer
i
absolutely
despised
this
now
i
really
appreciate
it
it
goes
down
easy
has
a
good
balance
between
thick
malt
and
lingering
bitterness
and
is
a
mainstay
for
me
drinkability
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
easily
but
probably
wouldnt
do
a
session
with
this
one
m
exceptionally
creamy
its
almost
like
drinking
liquid
silk
or
butter
thank
the
nitro
for
that
one
the
thickness
of
this
beer
makes
me
drink
it
exceptionally
slowly
and
lasts
a
long
time
fortunately
the
long
drinking
time
and
warming
up
doesnt
effect
the
flavor
badly
this
is
sort
of
a
study
in
contrasts
the
appearance
is
really
great
poured
from
a
nitro
can
pour
quickly
the
head
is
great
and
stays
with
it
the
entire
class
the
color
is
a
really
pretty
amber
with
a
pure
white
head
a
very
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
if
anything
it
has
a
rather
floral
smell
to
it
the
flavor
starts
out
very
bitter
from
the
head
then
malt
and
hops
from
the
beer
itself
and
then
comes
my
problem
with
this
beer
it
has
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
im
not
really
fond
of
sometimes
i
get
it
sometimes
i
dont
mostly
i
get
the
metallic
flavor
if
i
sip
the
beer
if
i
take
a
larger
drink
i
dont
seem
to
get
it
go
figure
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
sessionable
all
in
all
its
a
good
brew
dont
overchill
it
as
it
will
be
more
metallic
its
worth
a
try
and
you
may
find
you
really
like
it
i
like
it
but
there
are
other
styles
i
like
better
once
in
a
while
i
really
want
one
of
these
though
d
very
drinkable
session
beer
not
something
i
crave
probably
wouldnt
by
a
nitrocan
but
could
definately
see
buying
at
the
pub
again
poured
from
a
nitro
can
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
pleasent
mild
malty
aroma
good
smooth
flavor
with
a
slight
aftertaste
feels
a
little
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
little
dry
but
overall
drinkable
this
is
a
quality
beer
worth
checking
out
this
goes
down
pretty
doggone
easy
i
can
see
talking
my
macro
loving
buddies
into
trying
this
and
liking
it
this
is
pretty
creamy
mild
and
inoffensive
good
for
a
warm
summer
day
the
color
is
a
nice
clear
bright
amber
i
dont
get
the
nice
head
and
lacing
i
got
from
the
nitro
can
an
uncomplicated
blend
of
mild
bitter
hops
and
light
malt
are
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
light
herbal
citrus
hops
with
a
light
bitterness
and
grains
malt
is
somewhat
shy
but
does
make
an
appearance
theres
a
slight
metallic
astringent
tint
to
this
as
well
these
end
up
marring
an
otherwise
pleasant
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
lightbodied
and
this
one
loses
the
extreme
smoothness
and
creaminess
the
nitro
can
gave
it
this
is
one
to
try
but
its
nothing
spectacular
this
beer
looks
pretty
neat
as
all
of
the
micro
bubbles
cascade
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
it
acts
much
like
a
nitro
can
of
guinness
but
the
show
doesnt
last
as
long
when
its
over
im
left
with
a
clear
coppercolored
beer
with
a
dense
creamy
head
almost
looks
like
offwhite
cool
whip
sitting
atop
the
beer
not
much
to
boast
about
in
the
smell
category
the
most
abundant
smell
i
detect
is
metal
followed
by
light
sweet
malt
and
an
extremely
faint
bit
of
hops
while
the
metal
taste
is
present
in
the
flavor
the
carmel
malt
is
more
evident
and
theres
a
very
slight
bitter
hop
note
and
i
dont
necessarily
hate
the
metal
characteristic
it
tastes
like
clean
metal
at
least
like
a
dental
pick
during
a
cleaning
i
like
the
creamy
texture
light
low
carbonation
and
creamy
body
make
the
mouthfeel
by
far
the
best
characteristic
of
this
beer
low
alcohol
nice
body
and
mild
taste
make
this
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
wow
i
could
go
through
a
4
pack
of
these
so
quickly
so
drinkable
with
a
fantastic
mouthfeel
and
good
taste
damn
nice
nitro
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
thin
though
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
poured
nitrocan
into
pint
glass
creamy
decently
persistent
head
amber
color
after
it
settles
down
not
a
very
distinctive
smell
but
had
a
more
going
on
in
the
taste
category
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
light
on
the
carbonation
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
d
quite
drinkable
i
didnt
sense
anything
particularly
special
in
this
but
it
was
still
nice
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
thick
smooth
beer
but
when
you
get
a
good
batch
its
quite
good

the
nitro
can
fizzes
open
with
an
engulfing
widgetdriven
creamy
foamy
head
the
color
is
a
clear
ambercopper
the
aroma
smacks
of
sweet
malts
and
light
hops
mild
and
not
overwhelming
the
mouthfeel
gets
skewed
to
the
foamy
side
with
the
fluffy
nitro
head
skittering
across
my
tongue
but
overall
i
would
call
it
a
medium
body
the
taste
is
mildly
bitter
and
vaguely
hopped
i
like
this
one
and
drink
it
often
this
beer
was
light
bodies
but
crisp
and
a
creamy
smooth
a
pretty
easy
drinking
english
bitter
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
this
is
a
nitro
can
what
else
did
you
expect
i
just
dont
like
it
though
drinkability
taste
is
ok
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
its
nothing
to
rave
about
1
pint
can
pours
a
perfectly
clear
gold
with
the
typical
cascading
white
nitrogenous
head
smells
very
faintly
of
sweet
slightly
grassy
malt
kind
of
reminiscent
of
an
adjunct
lager
in
its
nondescription
the
taste
is
quite
muted
as
well
coming
across
as
lightly
malty
a
bit
peppery
and
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
body
is
light
and
smooth
as
bland
and
uninspiring
as
this
is
its
unoffensive
and
drinkable
drinkabilitythis
is
a
desent
pub
ale
very
fitting
to
the
style
its
going
for
although
a
find
this
to
be
almost
average
decent
beer
would
have
it
again
i
was
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
if
this
is
a
good
pub
ale
then
ill
stick
to
lagers
and
stouts
drinkability
3
5
the
positive
to
the
thin
body
is
that
estery
english
ales
tend
to
be
heavy
and
this
one
gives
the
lightbodied
beer
drinker
a
chance
to
appreciate
their
deliciousness
still
even
at
4

abv
one
does
not
find
oneself
going
back
for
more
with
the
enthusiasm
that
should
be
present
with
a
session
beer
this
is
drinkable
because
of
the
nonoffensive
tastes
but
im
not
going
to
buy
this
brew
in
the
future
drinkability
nope
not
this
one
id
really
like
to
drink
this
on
tap
though
im
sure
itd
be
a
much
better
way
to
taste
it
edit
2
out
of
4
of
the
cans
did
not
have
the
acrid
metallic
taste
adding

5
point
to

and
0

pours
a
yellowish
pale
golden
color
with
a
12
head
that
lasted
smelled
of
some
spice
and
fruitiness
but
overall
not
too
much
aroma
at
all
taste
was
very
smooth
a
light
fruitiness
with
a
slight
floral
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
definitely
lightbodied
subtle
creaminess
for
mouthfeel
but
wish
there
was
more
its
just
kind
of
uneventful
and
kind
of
watery
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
certainly
drinkable
though
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
too
memorable
either
d
not
doin
it
for
me
anymore
the
metallic
taste
is
just
a
tad
too
much
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
beer
has
fallen
out
of
good
graces
with
me
something
is
just
not
quite
how
i
remember
it
sad
day
a
lot
of
production
value
but
a
plot
that
is
very
ordinary
still
drinkable
d
though
this
was
not
a
challenging
beer
in
the
flavor
department
it
sure
is
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
at
the
end
of
the
day
id
say
its
at
about
the
same
level
as
guinness
all
things
considered
id
probably
prefer
guinny
if
given
the
choice
but
i
could
certainly
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
in
the
future
if
only
for
a
wiff
of
the
good
ol
days
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
ate
tortilla
chips
with
is
the
saltiness
went
well
with
the
beer
youll
find
it
easy
to
have
more
than
2
or
3
with
the
little
nitro
pellet
this
offers
a
full
sized
thick
white
head
that
holds
forever
over
a
clear
golden
orangebrown
color
brew
with
hints
of
splotchy
lacing
the
aroma
is
grassy
wheat
malt
skunky
but
fairly
polite
the
flavor
is
smooth
creamy
malt
with
a
somewhat
tart
edge
of
melon
very
nice
body
lots
of
gentle
carbonation
easy
drinking
a
very
decent
choice
with
medium
flavor
appeal
drinkability
is
good
i
think
this
is
probably
the
millerbud
for
englanders
although
this
definetly
has
more
character
then
those
two
it
goes
down
super
easy
not
much
to
contemplate
as
you
drink
something
to
slam
as
you
watch
futbol
d
ok
this
stuff
is
like
english
pale
ale
light
it
does
go
down
very
easy
though
pretty
decent
atmosphere
appearance
typical
with
a
nitrocan
and
a
pleasant
albeit
subdued
nose
decent
flavor
and
light
body
pretty
decent
quaff
drinkability
not
poor
but
id
spend
my
time
and
money
on
something
else
on
most
occasions
tastes
like
a
guinness
though
i
think
this
is
a
notch
above
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
pub
ales
this
is
a
very
one
dimensional
beer
but
it
is
one
i
can
drink
6
pack
of
no
problem
boddingtons
pours
super
smooth
and
creamy
with
2
fingers
of
head
no
complexity
but
oh
so
smooth
a
great
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
thirst
quencher
thats
incredibly
smooth
consistent
in
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
then
boddingtons
is
for
you
dont
drink
and
review
the
drinkability
is
middle
of
the
road
its
good
because
of
the
creaminess
and
simplicity
of
the
brew
but
the
weird
metallic
notes
in
the
taste
deter
it
from
being
a
good
sessioner
in
closing
this
beer
is
not
incredible
and
it
wasnt
brewed
to
be
i
still
buy
it
often
over
all
worth
the
try
but
not
my
cup
o
tea
truth
be
told
i
like
both
boddingtons
was
a
sort
of
crossover
beer
for
me
and
it
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
haha
but
i
do
enjoy
and
would
definitely
get
it
again
d
a
nice
beer
to
have
as
a
change
up
but
nothing
purchase
worthy
overall
impression
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
at
a
pub
or
to
have
around
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
a
good
quaffer
if
youre
not
looking
for
something
that
will
blow
your
pallet
or
be
hard
on
your
taste
buds
its
not
a
complex
beer
but
satisfying
and
does
the
job
a
light
pub
ale
should
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
cascading
carbonation
that
seems
to
fall
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
similar
to
guiness
creamy
frothy
white
head
leaves
a
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
corn
and
a
slight
malt
presence
no
hops
detected
d
very
drinkable
as
mentioned
above
but
again
too
drinkable
it
is
very
much
chugable
like
a
similar
nitrocan
stout
i
know
and
disdain
drinkability
not
too
far
from
a
drainpour
it
was
in
front
of
me
so
i
drank
it
mouthfeel
very
thin
and
i
couldnt
order
another
pint
im
contemplating
if
this
is
a
slow
mover
at
this
restaurant
will
have
to
seek
out
the
draught
cans
and
reevaluate
oh
boddingtons
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
have
when
served
on
tap
the
can
is
soso
but
on
tap
theres
something
about
a
lighter
nitrogen
beer
that
i
cant
quite
resist
the
thick
white
head
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
beverage
unlike
most
other
beers
this
perhaps
traps
some
of
the
aroma
in
though
which
is
for
the
most
part
not
really
there
at
all
other
than
the
lack
of
aroma
there
are
no
complaints
on
my
end
about
it
id
like
to
try
another
because
i
generally
dont
disagree
this
badly
with
my
fellow
bas
im
gonna
need
some
time
though
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
of
the
style
but
its
pretty
damn
good
and
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
makes
up
in
drinkability
very
nice
session
ale
overallreally
enjoyed
this
on
tap
flavorful
compared
to
most
english
pales
but
very
drinkable
bright
yellowgold
pour
hazy
with
a
huge
pillow
of
tiny
white
bubble
for
a
head
these
nitrocans
seem
to
always
give
beautiful
pours
bready
aroma
butterscotch
malt
creamy
and
has
a
light
flavor
more
butterscotch
caramel
and
a
tiny
bite
of
golding
hops
very
smooth
drinking
although
i
cant
imagine
what
the
other
version
tastes
like
if
this
is
the
stronger
version
decent
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
while
hanging
out
with
friends
at
the
bar
nothing
mind
blowing
just
a
good
session
beer
from
the
nitro
can
we
get
an
ambergold
pour
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
that
help
this
totally
flat
brew
produce
a
nice
creamy
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
quarter
of
an
inch
but
to
its
credit
lasts
to
the
end
as
does
the
fairly
nice
lace
the
ale
itself
has
a
pleasant
malty
not
too
hopped
taste
and
an
aroma
largely
of
malt
a
little
of
banana
and
a
touch
of
floral
but
this
brew
lacks
body
and
bubble
the
big
disappointment
here
is
that
despite
the
nitro
device
there
is
a
total
lack
of
carbonation
this
stuff
is
like
drinking
flat
beer
or
ale
flavored
water
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
boddingtons
ive
had
on
tap
while
in
london
at
8
for
4
pint
cans
id
opt
for
3
big
bass
bottles
i
highly
recommend
love
this
beer
a
bit
of
a
more
massproduced
beer
but
nonetheless
a
great
drink
a
great
taste
and
a
great
drink
and
not
too
heavy
so
there
is
no
issue
in
not
be
able
to
drink
plenty
best
out
of
the
tap
but
the
nitrocan
is
not
a
bad
second
option
ahhh
an
old
favorite
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
that
really
showed
me
what
beer
could
be
has
it
lived
up
to
my
memories
as
my
tastes
have
matured
not
quite
but
i
still
feel
like
this
is
a
quality
massproduced
brew
a
decent
looking
pour
with
an
attractive
head
a
nice
creamy
frothy
taste
i
sense
banana
am
i
crazy
or
is
it
there
a
beer
milkshake
type
of
feel
to
it
really
the
taste
is
a
bit
empty
compared
to
what
im
used
to
it
comes
and
goes
so
quickly
not
offensive
just
a
bit
weak
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
better
brews
i
have
graduated
too
but
it
does
live
up
to
the
memories
drinkability
while
bitter
the
alcohol
content
is
relativity
low
so
if
it
suits
your
taste
you
can
drink
this
all
night
much
like
guinness
it
excited
me
at
first
with
the
creamy
thick
white
head
the
head
tasted
great
reminded
me
of
a
foamy
marshmallow
type
taste
the
aroma
however
left
something
to
be
desired
as
nice
as
the
thick
creamy
head
was
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
beer
all
that
much
it
was
extremely
watery
in
contrast
with
the
head
and
just
felt
weak
overall
to
me
the
nitro
in
the
can
made
a
very
foamy
thick
head
that
lasted
through
most
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bit
too
creamy
for
me
which
seemed
to
hid
some
the
beers
attributes
it
had
mild
grain
flavor
couldnt
tell
to
much
more
could
drink
again
overall
definitely
not
worth
the
5pint
if
it
was
3
then
yes
a
good
session
beer
but
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
rather
pay
a
few
bucks
more
for
guinness
but
then
again
its
only
guinness
draught
no
extra
stout
here
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
i
cant
say
that
im
terribly
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
feel
like
it
should
have
more
flavor
despite
other
reviews
i
found
this
beer
to
be
an
exceptional
antithesis
of
the
flavorexploding
beers
in
large
production
these
days
ive
had
boddingtons
a
number
of
times
over
the
past
two
months
in
cans
and
from
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
in
austin
texas
and
im
always
excited
to
rely
on
it
as
an
incredibly
drinkable
lowgravity
beer
with
delicate
hints
of
sweet
corn
and
even
light
banana
on
the
after
taste
its
nose
isnt
incredibly
pronounced
but
is
reflective
of
the
subtle
flavors
within
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
frothy
and
melts
away
quickly
like
the
much
wider
known
guinness
brews
leaving
a
creamy
smoothness
on
the
palate
after
a
sip
for
those
who
want
a
great
beer
to
drink
during
events
that
you
wouldnt
normally
want
highgravity
movies
football
games
socials
with
important
guests
that
you
cant
turn
into
a
drunken
ass
in
front
of
then
boddingtons
pub
ale
is
for
you
cheers
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
domesticy
looking
big
white
creamy
head
lasting
very
malty
aroma
not
much
else
creamy
malty
but
balanced
taste
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
fruity
aftertaste
very
light
not
too
flavorful
this
nitro
can
produced
an
amusing
explosion
and
only
a
quick
grab
of
my
glass
prevented
a
mess
i
learned
my
lesson
about
these
things
a
while
ago
but
the
boddingtons
widget
seemed
particularly
aggressive
initially
the
beer
appears
to
be
a
nearly
solid
offwhite
head
a
roiling
mass
of
tiny
bubbles
jostling
their
way
to
the
top
the
head
settles
into
a
stiff
foam
like
an
overfrothed
cappuccino
it
looks
like
you
could
rest
change
on
top
of
that
head
the
beer
itself
is
a
paleyellow
gold
a
bit
disappointing
after
the
big
special
effects
display
of
the
nitrogen
the
smell
is
quite
weak
which
seems
counterintuitive
to
me
with
such
a
big
head
if
that
many
swirling
bubbles
cant
coax
more
than
a
weak
pale
malt
nose
out
of
this
beer
then
there
isnt
much
there
the
taste
would
almost
certainly
improve
if
the
beer
was
poured
from
a
tap
right
now
its
malty
but
thin
and
generic
the
feel
is
a
bit
watery
which
is
particularly
disappointing
when
compared
to
the
tap
version
i
remember
boddingtons
having
a
much
creamier
richer
feel
from
my
trip
to
the
uk
i
had
a
particularly
enjoyable
night
of
drinking
boddingtons
once
on
a
ferry
from
france
to
ireland
that
was
a
weird
twenty
or
so
hours
once
the
head
settles
and
all
the
commotion
comes
to
a
halt
this
beer
looks
like
its
made
of
styrofoam
or
wax
if
i
turn
it
upsidedown
will
it
spill
i
just
dont
know
a
pale
malt
aroma
without
much
else
a
bland
nose
i
cant
complain
about
the
taste
but
i
cant
rave
about
it
either
starts
out
clean
and
creamy
and
finishes
watery
and
slightly
bitter
very
drinkable
and
more
enjoyable
if
your
not
reviewing
or
thinking
too
much
about
the
flavor
a
foamy
gold
beer
the
smell
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
taste
is
bland
with
hint
of
something
in
the
spice
cabinet
im
glad
i
tasted
it
but
i
dont
think
id
want
a
bunch
of
them
they
arent
bad
or
offensive
though
and
go
down
easy
all
and
all
a
nice
uncomplicated
casual
ale
i
had
this
ale
for
the
first
time
a
couple
years
back
in
a
little
pub
in
brighton
england
i
immediately
fell
in
love
with
it
its
extremely
smooth
thick
creamy
head
and
the
bitter
notes
hit
the
back
of
the
tounge
just
right
luckily
its
really
easy
to
find
here
in
phoenix
and
churchills
pub
and
grill
always
have
it
on
tap
verdict
a
very
different
beer
boddingtons
in
a
can
is
an
experience
all
beer
lovers
should
try
at
least
once
perhaps
the
taste
is
not
the
most
remarkable
in
the
english
pale
ale
category
but
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
so
unique
that
the
beer
will
always
stand
out
to
me
a
worthy
survivor
of
more
than
two
centuries
d
not
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
but
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
smooth
but
needs
more
to
it
mild
caramel
maly
aroma
some
cooked
hops
fresh
flavor
has
some
fresh
hoppy
bitterness
up
front
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
but
unfortuantely
there
is
a
sour
edge
to
the
beer
that
leaves
a
somewhat
unpleasant
finish
drinkable
only
with
food
having
rough
time
finishing
this
alone
drinkability
was
an
ok
beer
i
dont
think
it
was
easy
drinking
beer
i
tried
this
at
disneys
epcot
the
key
feature
of
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
since
there
isnt
too
much
present
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
or
flavor
i
could
easily
picture
myself
throwing
down
a
bunch
of
these
at
a
bar
or
otherwise
in
the
company
of
friends
i
wasnt
too
impressed
in
terms
of
flavor
but
i
suppose
that
i
cant
knock
the
biscuit
character
too
much
its
not
bad
i
just
dont
think
its
anything
other
than
average
the
beer
pours
a
clear
darker
gold
roughly
a
38
inch
head
after
settling
in
glass
head
is
white
but
not
impressive
in
size
or
stature
there
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
to
speak
of
literally
no
flavor
other
than
a
sense
of
malt
denseness
and
a
tad
of
hops
at
the
close
mouthfeel
is
average
other
and
there
is
very
little
carbonation
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
but
wont
purchase
it
on
my
own
again
the
main
goal
of
the
nitro
widget
contained
in
this
can
of
boddingtons
is
to
reproduce
the
beer
as
you
would
get
it
on
nitrotap
it
should
have
a
dense
creamy
head
that
remains
atop
the
liquid
and
also
provide
a
creamy
mouthfeel
making
sure
the
can
was
not
too
cold
and
my
glass
was
big
enough
to
pour
the
entire
contents
i
poured
steadily
at
a
medium
pace
to
let
the
nitrogen
exit
the
widget
and
into
the
liquid
if
the
beer
is
too
cold
on
pouring
ive
noticed
a
complete
lack
of
aroma
this
is
a
very
light
beer
so
youve
really
got
to
coax
out
the
flavors
and
aromas
when
warm
enough
you
can
smell
the
banana
yeast
character
the
light
flavor
mimics
this
banana
note
this
canned
version
of
boddingtons
is
a
pale
imitation
of
the
tap
version
because
the
taste
and
smell
of
the
head
is
a
slight
bit
canny
or
metallic
and
also
a
bit
thin
in
flavor
and
aroma
the
mouthfeel
ends
more
watery
than
creamy
still
overall
the
boddingtons
flavor
although
one
dimensional
is
pleasant
heard
some
decent
things
about
this
beer
thought
id
give
it
a
whirl
like
guinness
or
murphys
its
a
nitro
can
so
its
neat
to
hear
the
nitro
widget
go
crazy
after
you
open
it
and
pour
it
in
the
glass
and
see
the
big
white
head
develop
thats
where
all
the
good
ends
and
the
bad
begins
smell
reaks
of
corn
more
than
budlight
its
crazy
how
unappealing
it
smells
taste
is
even
less
appealing
just
a
bitter
and
skunky
watery
mess
mouthfeel
is
like
distilled
water
i
woud
say
avoid
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
d
very
heavy
i
couldnt
do
more
than
a
few
of
these
per
session
great
as
a
final
drink
of
the
evening
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
d
boddingtons
the
embodiment
of
drinkability
i
still
really
like
this
beer
i
cant
help
it
went
down
smooth
and
mediumbodied
but
there
wasnt
much
of
a
discernable
taste
some
bread
and
sweet
malts
and
a
little
rough
backbite
from
either
roastedcoffee
malt
and
some
hop
prickness
but
still
a
tad
bland
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
id
much
rather
have
it
on
draft
than
out
of
the
can
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
did
not
dissipated
entirely
very
little
aroma
some
cereal
grains
and
a
slight
hint
of
malt
taste
was
honey
and
malty
slight
hops
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
hint
of
ripe
fruit
taste
was
very
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
was
excellent
sorta
of
like
cream
with
a
smooth
finish
drinkability
is
excellent
might
need
a
little
more
flavor
but
very
smooth
and
tasty
a
pretty
easydrinking
brew
but
drinkability
suffers
from
the
beers
flavor
which
while
not
bad
isnt
the
most
desirable
and
the
rather
flat
nature
due
to
lack
of
carbonation
keeps
it
from
really
refreshing
at
all
overall
rather
inoffensive
but
doesnt
leave
me
screaming
or
whispering
for
that
matter
for
another
round
decent
nothing
really
overly
stood
out
here
except
for
the
look
easy
body
and
mellow
drinkibility
not
offensive
by
any
means
but
unfortunately
not
that
memorable
either
so
to
summarize
great
head
great
mouthfeel
highly
sessionable
gargantuan
burps
that
may
or
may
not
annoy
others
depending
on
the
company
you
keep
otherwise
average
taste
drinkability
sometimes
im
in
a
mood
where
i
feel
like
guinness
but
want
something
that
is
more
refreshing
read
less
tasty
and
ill
order
it
at
the
pub
its
a
safe
bet
generally
and
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
better
on
tap
than
in
a
can
this
is
a
very
exceptional
beer
in
my
opinion
the
widget
gives
one
perhaps
a
better
than
tap
experience
i
highly
recommend
especially
while
watching
soccer
err
football
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
creamy
head
almost
out
of
control
fairly
smooth
and
creamy
with
sweet
malts
and
leaves
somewhat
of
a
bitter
taste
good
beer
for
a
while
it
was
a
regular
of
mine
at
5
for
4
pint
size
cans
it
comes
at
a
decent
price
too
d
the
nitro
foam
and
buttery
taste
slightly
put
me
off
however
its
such
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
i
am
tempted
to
pickup
a
few
more
d
not
bad
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
23
i
have
before
at
parties
ha
without
already
being
a
state
of
liquid
bliss
but
it
is
certainly
a
change
of
pace
from
all
the
terrapin
rye
and
other
ipas
i
drank
last
night
worth
trying
at
least
once
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
rather
dissapointing
brew
it
also
seemed
to
loose
its
carbonation
a
little
too
quickly
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
an
alright
beer
aftertaste
is
definately
its
downfall
but
the
mouthfeel
makes
it
better
i
am
not
impressed
at
all
i
dont
think
i
will
get
this
again
and
there
is
no
reason
to
recommend
this
wouldnt
recommend
it
poured
from
the
can
with
the
widget
into
a
tall
glass
beautiful
cascade
effect
that
soon
settled
to
a
crisp
golden
light
amber
ale
with
a
full
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
a
faint
mixture
of
light
malt
with
some
sweetness
perhaps
from
honey
there
is
a
bread
like
quality
with
the
aroma
pleasant
just
needs
to
be
stronger
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
slightly
thin
although
the
finish
is
decent
which
keeps
this
category
from
tanking
flavor
is
ok
but
really
lacks
especially
in
the
malt
department
slightly
bitter
to
the
tongue
there
is
that
watery
aspect
again
that
really
makes
this
ale
fall
way
short
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
can
md
feels
and
drinks
excellent
silky
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
through
a
pint
in
no
time
the
nitrocan
on
this
classic
pale
ale
does
a
good
job
of
simulating
what
you
get
in
handdrawn
pint
served
in
an
english
pub
but
theres
still
something
lacking
the
nitrogen
does
a
good
job
of
creating
a
nice
white
foamy
head
that
lingers
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
even
if
you
take
a
while
to
nurse
the
pint
when
first
poured
the
ale
has
a
nice
convectionlike
action
as
the
nitrogen
stabilizes
but
afterward
you
have
just
the
thick
white
head
atop
a
clear
amber
body
theres
little
nose
on
this
one
but
a
very
nice
and
full
mouthfeel
with
a
matching
full
hoppiness
on
both
the
palate
and
the
finish
a
pleasant
bitter
aftertaste
polishes
it
off
as
a
pub
ale
with
nitrogen
rather
than
carbonation
it
naturally
is
a
little
flat
and
thus
not
as
refreshing
as
some
other
brews
of
similar
consistency
for
me
this
makes
it
less
enticing
for
drinking
more
than
one
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
but
i
wouldnt
buy
one
again
a
summer
quencher
at
best
shame
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
to
my
surprise
the
first
can
i
opened
burst
over
onto
my
hand
and
the
carpet
so
i
handed
that
one
to
my
friend
the
next
one
i
cracked
open
i
poured
directly
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
poured
a
golden
yellow
and
created
a
beautiful
head
not
much
smell
to
the
beer
and
compared
to
many
other
beers
not
much
carbonation
its
a
very
hard
beer
to
describe
in
taste
and
the
best
i
can
come
up
with
is
a
creamy
budweiser
with
a
lot
less
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
would
recommend
it
if
your
looking
to
switch
things
up
golden
yellow
body
with
lots
of
bubbles
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
healthy
head
with
very
small
bubbles
giving
it
a
creamy
appearance
sweet
almost
citrusy
aroma
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
heavy
and
low
in
carbonation
taste
is
good
but
very
hard
for
me
to
describe
light
hoppy
slightly
floral
good
allaround
beer
typical
of
the
style
maybe
a
bit
bland
but
very
refreshing
with
just
enough
flavor
and
low
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
a
nice
session
beer
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
thick
foamy
head
on
a
medium
amber
body
smelled
of
cheap
flat
wine
with
the
taste
being
about
the
same
just
not
pleasant
in
any
fashion
this
was
my
first
nitro
can
and
if
this
is
what
i
can
expect
from
them
all
ill
pass
a
truly
golden
amber
forms
a
thick
white
head
that
stays
clinging
to
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
the
sweet
airy
with
a
hint
of
honey
scent
made
the
pour
of
this
brew
quite
enjoyable
the
sweet
malty
taste
is
nice
and
creamy
after
a
couple
of
gulps
the
creamy
thickness
with
a
slight
bitter
taste
at
the
end
makes
this
for
an
enjoyable
drink
in
the
end
my
only
thought
was
give
me
more
poured
thick
and
goldan
and
settled
slowley
it
smells
sweet
my
first
sip
and
i
was
in
love
this
is
sweet
and
malty
and
goes
down
smooth
this
one
is
the
smothist
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
one
goes
down
like
drinking
creem
the
taste
is
light
but
hardy
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
closest
to
cream
and
honey
in
a
beer
i
have
ever
had
1069
boddingtons
is
a
pleasant
english
ale
clearly
not
the
best
but
its
one
of
those
beers
i
can
always
turn
to
and
be
pleased
with
d
ok
i
suppose
the
nitrowidget
seems
a
bit
gimmicky
to
cover
up
an
otherwise
average
beer
d
i
pretty
much
drink
this
whenever
they
bust
out
the
beers
for
company
happy
hours
as
it
is
easily
the
best
beer
that
we
regularly
get
very
enjoyable
anytime
of
the
year
works
great
for
sessions
drinkabillity
im
not
sure
if
ill
finish
this
4pack
what
does
that
tell
you
drinkability
is
very
good
here
straight
from
the
can
this
stuff
goes
down
easy
and
quickly
theres
no
doubt
many
of
these
can
be
consumed
in
one
sitting
cheers
mate
the
taste
is
malty
and
pleasing
with
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
worthwhile
nutty
and
roasted
tones
combine
well
with
the
obvious
creamy
texture
to
create
a
satisfying
mellow
drinking
experience
there
is
some
metal
briefly
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
rounds
into
shape
quickly
definitely
a
great
pub
watching
the
match
type
ale
stupid
and
immature
collect
your
winnings
overall
a
very
clean
and
nonoffensive
pale
alebitter
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
and
it
doesnt
go
out
of
its
way
to
be
unique
or
different
but
it
still
fits
in
nicely
much
improvement
as
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
very
drinkable
as
always
will
get
some
more
d
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
ill
be
having
again
after
i
finish
off
this
four
pack
nice
look
to
it
deep
copperamber
color
with
a
smallish
head
and
a
touch
of

is
extremely
mild
just
a
subtle
hint
of
malt
flavor
is
similar
light
caramel
malt
comes
through
slightly
metallic
as
well
no
real
hop
presence
feel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
good
body
overall
its
mild
as
hell
but
not
really
objectionable
not
a
lot
going
on
head
is
so
thick
and
foamy
almost
like
a
meringue
body
is
thin
with
low
carbonation
bitter
notes
are
too
overpowering
to
make
this
very
drinkable
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
this
was
part
of
a
5
beer
flight
of
pale
ales
and
was
easily
the
worst
of
them
palate
is
inoffensive
hint
of
bitterness
but
quite
a
bit
pungent
maltiness
to
it
could
use
lower
abv
pretty
easy
drinking
in
nitro
format
at
least
i
remember
it
being
better
than
this
in
england
but
i
was
an
18
year
old
novice
at
the
time
this
pours
a
golden
amber
color
and
has
an
average
beige
head
not
really
much
smell
or
taste
there
are
some
really
mild
malts
and
faint
hops
the
body
is
nice
initially
but
turns
too
watery
as
the
beers
warms
nothing
bad
here
just
a
light
mild
ale
that
drinks
easy
i
was
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
review
this
on
tap
and
my
review
is
mainly
a
comparison
to
the
nitrocan
version
boddingtons
on
tap
definitely
expresses
more
of
a
pale
ale
character
as
opposed
to
its
nearly
flavorless
nitrocan
counterpart
but
its
still
a
bit
of
an
inferior
beer
the
absence
of
the
creaminess
takes
away
from
the
charm
of
the
nitrocan
but
the
true
flavor
of
boddingtons
becomes
more
apparent
slight
carbonation
really
helps
this
brew
and
for
some
reason
i
found
the
tap
version
to
be
largely
devoid
of
the
horrid
metallic
aftertaste
mfd
the
little
amount
of
carbonation
help
this
ale
maintain
its
creamy
smoothness
although
not
packed
with
too
much
flavor
this
ale
is
enjoyable
and
easily
sessioned
d
while
it
is
easy
to
consume
it
comes
off
rather
to
basic
and
i
would
probably
tire
easily
of
this
one
in
session
good
i
guess
for
slugging
them
back
at
the
local
pub
and
turning
your
brain
off
while
you
drink
like
i
said
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
nitrobased
serving
devices
a
little
extra
co2
could
make
this
beer
significantly
more
enjoyable
d
easy
to
drink
many
at
a
time
but
for
the
price
i
would
not
drink
many
drinkability
is
decent
the
flavors
and
aromas
here
create
nice
profiles
but
the
mouthfeel
just
kills
the
enjoyment
a
bit
of
co2
and
a
thicker
body
would
really
make
this
brew
come
alive
in
the
mouth
d
if
you
are
at
a
pub
that
has
no
micros
its
a
good
choice
to
break
the
monotony
of
guinness
and
newcastle
look
out
for
the
big
rush
of
air
and
bubbles
from
the
nitro
can
and
have
your
pint
glass
ready
this
beer
pours
with
a
thick
and
foamy
head
wonderful
active
bubbles
slowly
float
to
the
top
to
form
a
thick
white
head
this
creamy
white
head
sits
on
top
of
a
golden
amber
body
with
tons
of
tiny
slow
rising
bubbles
the
aroma
is
floral
with
some
malty
notes
the
flavor
is
creamy
sweet
and
smooth
it
has
a
very
light
malt
character
with
a
watery
middle
and
some
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
overall
its
a
very
interesting
beer
with
smooth
light
flavors
overall
an
excellent
english
beer
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
come
back
to
from
time
to
time
overflowed
slightly
from
the
can
after
opening
poured
a
huge
creamy
white
which
formed
a
great
big
4
inch
creamy
white
head
taking
about
5
minutes
to
settle
completely
left
tons
of
white
lace
all
over
the
pint
very
mild
scent
of
malt
with
not
much
else
nice
creamy
flavor
very
mild
but
not
bland
light
malt
with
very
mild
hint
of
hops
and
slightly
sweet
5
0
on
the
mouthfeel
with
a
huge
creamy
fullbodied
mouthcoating
that
covers
every
bit
without
a
doubt
one
of
those
beers
you
can
pound
all
day
not
huge
flavor
but
tasty
nonetheless
perfect
warmweather
summertime
brew
drinkability
one
and
thats
enough
for
me
i
just
cant
enjoy
more
than
a
pint
of
it
i
think
that
being
out
of
a
can
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
the
taste
is
similar
being
very
mild
toasted
grain
with
faint
hint
of
caramel
light
hint
of
leaves
and
grass
with
a
lightly
bitter
finish
its
feel
is
conflicted
both
creamy
from
the
head
yet
a
little
thin
watery
and
flat
overall
the
flavours
are
good
and
they
do
hold
up
quite
well
to
food
etc
but
it
needs
more
it
is
however
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
at
least
some
character
even
if
a
bit
onedimensional
probably
would
not
drink
this
again
dthis
is
a
beer
i
can
drink
better
out
of
the
tap
then
in
the
can
being
very
crisp
and
light
makes
it
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
nitro
can
which
provided
a
very
nice
milky
cascade
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
upon
finishing
the
pour
it
had
a
very
nice
white
head
that
seemed
to
linger
but
not
for
too
long
it
had
a
nice
golden
yellow
haze
to
it
that
i
could
not
see
through
not
much
nose
to
it
at
all
the
mouthful
was
very
creamy
a
bit
watery
but
yet
full
and
heavy
i
find
the
beer
very
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
very
smooth
great
beer
with
any
type
of
pub
grub
and
one
that
i
try
to
enjoy
often
boddingtons
is
one
of
the
few
beers
than
i
prefer
out
of
a
can
instead
of
on
tap
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
boddingtons
reveals
its
beautiful
golden
color
and
surprisingly
creamy
head
not
much
of
a
scent
to
it
but
a
very
clean
tasting
bear
with
very
subtle
citrus
notes
the
mouth
feel
is
full
and
smooth
and
the
second
pint
goes
down
as
easy
as
the
first
id
definitely
recommend
boddingtons
to
any
beer
connoisseur
regardless
of
taste
drinkability
was
lower
due
to
me
not
enjoying
watery
beers
d
poor
i
will
not
seek
this
one
out
again
mfd
watery
goes
down
rather
quickly
its
easy
to
drink
thats
for
sure
but
i
have
a
hard
time
getting
past
its
flavour
what
little
of
it
there
is
just
isnt
pleasant
to
me
and
it
really
makes
me
feel
like
im
drinking
something
thats
literally
been
diluted
oh
those
silly
english
they
should
know
better
and
leave
the
creamy
beers
to
us
irish
truly
a
session
beer
it
is
increasingly
easy
to
amuse
my
small
mind
watching
the
pour
cascade
from
a
milky
liquid
into
a
nice
ambercolored
beer
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
the
fingers
worth
of
thick
creamy
ecru
head
sat
like
a
blanket
of
fresh
snow
atop
the
beer
the
nose
was
faint
and
slightly
sweet
almost
in
a
lagerlike
way
the
color
was
a
medium
amber
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
even
kind
of
silky
on
the
swallow
this
was
a
very
mild
beer
both
on
the
tongue
and
on
the
finish
these
factors
coupled
with
its
low
abv
make
it
a
session
candidate
especially
when
you
include
its
fairly
common
availability
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
a
lot
like
a
guiness
but
the
flavor
doesnt
have
any
of
the
coffee
flavor
its
a
pretty
mild
beer
without
much
bitterness
at
all
but
the
flavor
that
is
there
tastes
really
good
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
if
you
like
the
heavier
drinks
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
to
me
d
this
is
okay
i
think
that
it
is
far
better
on
tap
than
from
a
nitro
can
d
a
refreshing
beer
good
with
the
salmon
mashed
potatoes
that
i
had
at
finnegans
wake
in
key
west
fla
i
touristy
macro
place
but
still
you
have
a
descent
selection
and
they
do
have
really
good
food
go
there
if
you
need
a
descent
beer
d
this
is
a
great
pub
ale
in
my
opinion
much
better
than
tetleys
it
has
more
flavour
and
provides
a
more
pleasing
drinking
experience
i
love
the
touch
of
honey
in
this
one
this
stuff
is
sooo
easy
to
drink
i
think
i
could
have
ten
hey
its
st
patricks
day
after
all
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
this
beer
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
goto
beers
i
especially
like
the
4
7
abv
which
really
helps
the
sessionability
of
this
tasty
english
beer
imo
this
beer
is
closer
to
an
english
bitter
than
a
pale
ale
whatever
it
is
a
delicious
pour
this
can
was
pretty
weird
when
i
opened
it
the
beer
began
to
gush
out
uncontrollably
i
then
poured
it
into
a
glass
it
was
a
very
light
yellow
color
that
had
a
huge
head
and
a
some
what
musty
smell
it
was
very
watery
and
extremley
flat
not
a
good
brew
t
its
very
watery
you
get
a
little
creamy
malt
taste
but
there
is
very
little
back
bone
and
the
beer
could
be
better
its
very
easy
to
session
and
not
notice
but
its
not
the
kinda
beer
that
will
smack
you
in
the
face
and
make
you
take
notice
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
straw
just
slight
amber
color
with
the
classic
nitro
thick
white
head
aroma
is
very
mild
with
the
a
watery
thin
malt
note
a
bit
of
grassy
floral
hop
character
on
the
palate
a
caramel
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
comes
through
very
clean
it
finishes
with
a
firm
and
floral
bitterness
medium
dry
the
low
carbonation
from
the
nitro
makes
it
very
easy
drinking
overall
i
could
certainly
see
myself
drinking
several
but
theres
a
strange
stale
hop
flavor
that
limits
over
consumption
this
can
exploded
when
i
opened
it
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
gold
in
color
nice
white
head
though
smell
has
very
faint
hops
taste
is
ugly
bitter
too
watery
for
me
all
in
all
i
would
rather
hump
the
hell
out
of
a
yaks
sweet
ass
and
then
lap
up
the
hot
sweat
dripping
off
of
its
scrodum
behold
boddingtons
ale
the
finest
drink
our
band
the
ill
mayhem
loves
this
beer
for
post
session
sessions
this
beer
is
a
great
pub
ale
you
can
pour
it
as
fast
and
hard
as
you
like
and
the
beer
cascades
out
to
a
foamy
half
inch
head
which
maintains
for
the
duration
the
frothy
head
also
has
a
creamy
or
marshmellowy
swseetness
if
you
decided
to
down
it
as
well
the
ill
mayhem
loves
this
beer
we
endorse
it
and
would
like
to
be
sponsored
by
it
our
bass
player
rootin
tootin
rasputin
has
been
quoted
as
saying
boddingtons
pub
ale
is
proof
that
god
loves
us
and
wants
us
to
be
happy
from
his
treetop
perch
the
first
time
i
bought
boddingtons
the
old
man
at
the
liquor
store
declared
that
is
the
smoothest
beer
ive
ever
had
cheers
bro
golden
to
copper
in
color
after
it
has
settled
with
a
dense
creamy
eggshell
head
and
sticky
powdered
coffee
creamer
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruit
in
the
back
very
general
the
taste
begins
with
sweet
grains
slightly
fruity
and
dms
mild
bittering
hops
grow
into
the
finish
with
floral
notes
and
a
slightly
soapy
astringent
aftertaste
is
herbal
dry
straw
and
tea
notes
thin
body
low
carbonation
and
nearly
watery
mouthfeel
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
throw
back
this
is
a
really
pretty
good
ale
that
is
mellow
in
flavor
smooth
and
well
balanced
ive
only
seen
it
in
nitrocans
or
on
tap
at
a
couple
places
worth
a
taste
for
yourself
d
the
look
was
great
but
got
steadily
worse
from
there
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
probably
wont
be
drinking
again
anytime
soon
fun
to
give
someone
and
not
mention
the
gusher
part
when
poured
it
created
a
cream
coloured
moussy
head
mouthfeel
was
full
and
round
quite
plesant
in
the
glass
the
beer
was
dark
amber
colour
with
a
lot
of
effervecense
the
nose
was
soft
and
sweet
with
hints
of
toast
a
very
good
malt
flavour
finished
with
a
slight
hint
of
bitters
da
very
light
beer
to
wrap
up
my
evening
of
drinking
but
not
a
normal
choice
for
me
was
at
an
irish
bar
and
wanted
something
other
then
my
usual
guinness
waitress
suggested
this
wonderful
beer
it
is
like
a
creamy
bass
ale
only
better
just
a
great
drinking
experience
not
too
hoppy
but
right
almost
as
wonderul
as
guinness
but
nothing
comes
close
to
the
original
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
alcohol
isnt
very
high
so
its
easy
to
drink
plenty
this
isnt
really
a
drink
thats
going
to
make
you
think
and
contemplate
its
nature
but
you
dont
have
to
prepare
yourself
for
each
sip
d
great
session
beer
tasty
d
ill
probably
revisit
this
one
actually
it
has
some
excellent
session
qualities
and
isnt
a
shabby
brew
by
any
means
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
16
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
crisp
golden
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
in
full
force
for
the
entirety
of
the
beer
leaves
really
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
a
nondescript
sweetness
almost
like
banana
but
lacking
that
hefe
quality
taste
is
nothing
i
remember
loving
this
beer
before
becoming
a
full
out
beer
geek
wow
how
palates
change
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
you
would
expect
with
an
aerator
all
in
all
you
can
drink
it
for
the
mouthfeel
but
dont
drink
it
for
the
taste
definitely
not
worth
the
cost
of
this
beer
rerate
on
tap
looks
the
part
but
the
flavour
is
odd
i
prefer
the
can
i
think
but
who
knows
if
i
feel
like
a
widget
beer
go
with
guinness
or
youngs
double
choc
d
the
low
abv
and
traditional
english
label
make
this
a
great
one
to
session
at
the
pub
judging
from
other
reviews
i
wouldnt
buy
this
unless
its
on
tap
i
found
this
beer
to
be
ok
for
drinkability
boddingtons
is
a
mixed
bag
of
a
beer
while
the
technical
aspects
appearance
mouthfeel
were
solid
the
taste
was
a
little
to
harsh
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
it
a
regular
thing
also
buying
it
in
a
bar
around
here
is
pretty
expensive
d
the
fruit
finish
is
a
little
difficult
to
overcome
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
an
average
beer
it
poured
nicely
into
the
mug
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
thick
white
head
that
persisted
through
the
drinking
unfortunately
it
was
downhill
form
there
there
wasnt
much
smell
to
speak
of
and
the
taste
was
bland
and
watery
with
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
felt
that
the
beer
was
undercarbonated
and
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
drinkability
if
youre
looking
for
an
extreme
taste
sensation
then
youll
be
sorely
disappointed
if
youre
looking
for
a
relatively
lowalcohol
smooth
easydrinking
beer
then
thisll
do
in
a
pinch
unfortunately
i
prefer
the
former
got
this
beer
ontap
at
a
new
irish
pub
in
frisco
it
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
2finger
head
the
smell
wasnt
very
stong
could
smell
a
touch
of
malt
but
nothing
that
jumped
out
at
me
the
taste
was
kinda
bland
and
watery
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
going
to
be
a
1st
choice
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
watery
overall
i
could
see
this
beer
being
a
decent
beer
to
drink
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
no
real
effect
considering
the
4abv
feels
creamy
but
kind
of
thin
not
very
appealing
but
not
too
bad
either
d
its
a
good
session
beer
and
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
and
if
it
were
available
on
a
limited
beer
menu
id
surely
pick
it
out
again
not
offensive
just
not
very
adventerous
either
but
then
again
not
every
beer
should
be
i
guess
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
does
what
the
brewer
intended
overall
not
bad
d
mild
and
easily
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
fault
this
beer
for
being
bland
and
make
no
mistake
it
is
bland
but
one
must
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
as
it
says
on
the
can
a
pub
ale
this
is
not
meant
to
be
pondered
but
consumed
casually
in
good
company
and
for
that
it
is
adequate
i
have
certainly
had
better
british
ales
but
this
does
its
job
on
tap
at
the
draught
house
white
rich
creamy
lasting
head
like
a
squirt
of
shaving
cream
lightly
sweet
floral
honey
and
alcohol
aroma
extremely
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
very
lightly
carbonated
slighty
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
twinge
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
decent
but
it
could
use
just
a
tad
more
carbonation
but
i
understand
this
is
the
style
of
the
beer
not
bad
but
not
something
i
crave
very
very
drinkable
but
not
flavorful
enough
to
really
entice
me
ive
had
it
out
of
the
nitrocan
and
thought
it
wasnt
as
good
probably
just
didnt
get
the
right
head
out
of
it
its
nice
mellow
and
great
for
just
hanging
out
and
having
a
few
latenight
d
besides
the
strange
aftertaste
these
are
pretty
decent
i
wouldnt
run
out
and
buy
a
bunch
but
it
is
worth
a
try
d
i
can
drink
several
of
these
no
problem
its
definitely
worth
a
try
quite
forgettable
ale
very
light
copper
color
with
a
dense
white
head
faint
aroma
of
fuggles
in
the
background
very
thin
body
and
mouthfeel
the
front
end
and
middle
was
oily
with
little
to
no
malt
character
weak
bitterness
can
be
detected
in
the
finish
not
worth
the
7
bucks
a
4pack
they
ask
for
on
tap
down
in
new
haven
at
bar
i
liked
it
out
of
the
tap
at
first
it
poured
an
all
white
beer
that
stayed
for
about
10
minutes
until
it
settled
into
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
very
thick
and
creamy
white
head
the
head
stuck
around
the
length
of
the
beer
but
since
it
was
so
thick
and
creamy
it
was
a
nice
touch
it
had
a
light
malty
aroma
with
a
sweet
smell
at
the
end
the
taste
was
pretty
good
it
was
really
smooth
with
light
maltyhoppiness
and
then
a
sweet
almost
creamy
taste
afterwards
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
draft
pours
beautifully
has
that
middle
section
that
forms
into
foam
on
top
and
beer
on
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
weak
and
the
taste
begins
the
same
but
finishes
with
a
very
pleasant
bitter
bite
not
an
outstanding
beer
it
wont
impress
your
beergeek
buddies
but
it
is
a
nice
little
brew
to
drink
in
a
pub
with
some
food
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
16oz
nitro
can
from
a
local
grocery
store
pours
a
translucent
goldenamber
with
a
respectivle
inch
or
more
of
offwhite
head
biscuit
malts
show
through
in
the
aroma
with
very
little
else
i
can
notice
biscuity
and
somewhat
roasty
malts
along
with
a
good
dose
of
english
hops
characterize
the
flavor
initially
but
give
way
to
a
fairly
clean
finish
thick
no
doubt
due
to
the
nitro
yet
oddly
aqueous
in
the
mouthfeel
with
few
to
no
bubbles
almost
flat
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
but
by
no
means
as
complex
or
flavorful
as
its
counterparts
in
the
style
not
much
going
on
here
not
that
impressed
with
this
one
overall
though
at
5
99
per
4pack
its
at
least
cheaper
than
a
lot
of
its
competition
d
a
very
sessionable
brew
indeed
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
or
assertiveness
it
makes
up
for
with
a
pleasantly
mild
and
tasty
drinkability
my
old
roommate
at
ft
stweart
introduced
me
to
this
beauty
thanks
mcelroy
i
love
the
way
this
beer
pours
downward
flowing
bubbles
like
guinness
super
creamy
head
amazing
clarity
and
decent
carbonation
nose
is
a
bit
weak
very
malt
forward
with
a
sweetcreamy
feel
to
it
taste
is
a
tame
creamy
and
approachable
this
beer
and
the
style
it
represent
is
meant
to
be
consumed
pint
after
pint
and
not
destroy
you
even
though
the
score
is
low
on
this
beer
it
is
enjoyable
and
has
its
time
and
place
overall
a
runofthe
mill
pale
ale
that
doesnt
seem
to
gain
much
from
a
nitrohead
i
feel
that
stouts
work
better
for
nitrocans
than
pale
ales
its
still
a
decent
beer
and
that
isnt
enough
to
take
away
from
it
the
taste
matches
the
smell
good
hop
bitternessno
citrus
really
just
bitter
with
some
honey
sweetness
and
some
metallic
taste
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
here
and
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
finish
is
actually
the
only
part
that
i
dont
fancy
too
much
but
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
taster
and
so
darn
easy
to
drink
i
dont
know
why
i
like
boddingtons
i
just
do
and
i
buy
it
every
so
often
a
no
frills
beer
really
the
mouth
feel
and
taste
are
very
thin
almost
like
the
beer
was
watered
down
i
just
cant
get
past
that
sure
there
are
other
things
to
say
but
they
are
minor
compared
to
the
wateriness
this
beer
is
a
light
british
ale
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
due
to
the
nitro
head
produced
from
the
widget
hops
bitterness
was
very
present
in
this
beer
with
a
light
thin
mouthfeel
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
thirst
quencher
the
last
can
i
had
had
a
slight
metallic
twinge
to
it
that
didnt
play
well
with
the
hops
i
feel
they
could
have
gone
a
little
lighter
on
the
hops
to
balance
out
the
beer
d
with
a
relatively
low
abv
it
is
easy
to
kill
the
4
pack
at
a
hurried
pace
d
not
quick
sure
why
i
like
this
so
much
it
is
almost
like
drinking
air
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
i
find
myself
always
ready
for
another
the
4
pack
just
seems
to
disappear
over
the
course
of
the
night
the
price
is
right
for
it
when
it
is
on
sale
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
around
and
goes
with
everything
drinkability
a
treat
to
drink
this
beer
makes
a
nice
addition
to
a
drinking
session
featuring
beers
that
are
more
aggressive
it
soothes
the
senses
and
prepares
them
for
the
next
round
pours
clear
gold
nice
dense
long
lasting
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
fruit
notes
mild
with
a
malty
flavor
biscuity
very
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
otherwise
no
real
noticable
hop
flavor
balanced
and
mild
overall
low
carbonation
and
creamy
texture
very
drinkable
definitely
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
one
that
everyone
should
have
you
can
quaff
this
one
all
night
as
its
flavor
is
not
going
to
be
overpowering
nor
will
the
alcohol
content
kick
you
in
the
ass
this
is
one
for
drinking
with
a
ton
of
friends
at
the
local
dive
bar
when
all
you
want
to
do
is
have
hearty
fun
and
conversation
better
on
tap
so
if
you
can
find
a
place
that
serves
it
go
there
and
knock
on
the
gates
to
heaven
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
very
creamy
head
looks
like
a
yellow
guinness
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
little
grainy
a
bit
nondescript
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
and
dry
which
makes
for
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
easy
to
see
why
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
as
it
is
incredibyl
easy
to
drink
you
can
expect
to
get
a
thick
creamy
head
the
cascading
effect
and
darker
yellowish
body
smell
is
a
little
weird
metallic
grainy
and
a
light
esters
to
my
surprise
this
was
not
very
tasty
it
fact
it
reminded
me
of
a
creamy
nitroinfused
budweiser
i
think
the
creamy
head
had
more
taste
than
the
beer
itself
the
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
forgiving
and
keeps
my
interest
although
the
beer
is
a
bit
boring
i
could
actually
see
myself
having
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
its
quite
sessionable
ill
admit
that
i
really
wanted
to
get
this
beer
to
check
out
the
nitrocan
it
poured
a
light
brown
with
golden
highlights
and
a
nice
creamy
foamy
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
with
a
little
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
the
taste
is
a
little
more
watery
than
i
expected
with
a
nice
little
bit
of
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
and
a
slight
touch
of
hops
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
really
nice
and
creamy
while
the
head
was
in
full
effect
and
a
little
bit
thin
after
the
head
dissipates
id
consider
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
and
i
could
imagine
sitting
a
pub
and
knocking
back
quite
a
few
of
these
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
just
for
the
taste
since
nitrotap

i
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
beer
it
was
purchased
in
a
can
and
it
contained
one
of
those
nitrogen
balls
that
when
busted
is
supposed
to
release
nitrogen
into
the
drink
and
cause
a
nice
head
to
form
i
found
it
to
work
rather
nicely
and
the
head
was
beautiful
overall
the
appearance
smell
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
was
exceptional
this
is
something
i
could
drink
regularly
drinkability
not
the
most
exciting
beer
ive
had
but
i
really
enjoy
this
one
as
a
session
beer
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
and
w
a
low
abv
overall
it
doesnt
hurt
too
much
in
the
morning
this
beer
is
an
all
around
great
draught
that
can
be
quaffed
by
the
pint
in
a
good
pub
or
at
home
in
many
other
beers
i
would
consider
the
nitro
aspect
to
be
a
negative
factor
but
the
easy
drinkability
of
boddingtons
captures
the
essence
of
a
lighter
pub
draught
in
my
mind
if
i
want
a
good
bitter
or
pale
ale
ill
get
one
if
i
want
an
easy
drink
that
quenches
the
thirst
and
palate
ill
order
a
boddingtons
this
beer
had
a
nice
look
to
it
a
nice
dark
golden
hue
that
allowed
the
light
to
shine
through
it
very
nice
scent
very
unique
i
could
not
place
many
of
the
scents
and
each
time
i
took
a
sniff
there
was
a
nice
swirl
of
new
scents
very
unique
taste
too
a
nice
balance
seemed
slightly
more
malty
to
me
than
bitter
again
like
the
smell
each
taste
had
subtle
changes
from
the
previous
one
goes
down
very
smooth
this
is
going
to
be
a
nice
addition
to
my
list
of
usuals
to
have
on
hand
this
was
one
of
my
transition
beers
that
opened
me
up
to
the
nonmainstream
world
for
that
i
am
grateful
to
it
however
because
it
opened
me
up
to
this
world
i
now
know
that
there
are
far
superior
beers
to
be
had
this
beer
is
a
step
up
from
drinking
miller
bud
ect
not
a
great
beer
but
the
can
always
looks
cool
an
old
classic
of
mine
for
many
many
years
1
pt
can
from
albertsons
poured
coppergold
color
with
a
foamycreamy
head
there
was
virtually
no
aroma
just
an
odd
sort
of
metallic
scent
flavor
was
mild
with
malts
nuts
pears
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
light
but
creamy
clearly
the
palate
is
this
beers
appeal
the
finish
was
short
clean
and
just
a
bit
biter
overall
this
is
a
quite
sessionable
biter
but
it
lacks
pizazz
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
cascading
carbonationnitrogenation
that
seems
to
fall
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
similar
to
guiness
creamy
frothy
white
head
leaves
a
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
corn
and
a
slight
malt
presence
no
hops
detected
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
similar
to
guiness
but
unlike
guiness
the
taste
is
rather
lacking
overall
this
is
simply
an
average
beer
i
will
not
be
wasting
my
money
on
this
beer
again
super
heavy
beer
a
meal
in
a
can
but
the
abv
is
not
that
high
pours
90
frothy
creamy
head
appears
in
three
layers
briefly
then
settles
into
a
clear
transluscent
auburn
ale
with
a
two
finger
creamywhite
head
no
observable
carbonation
which
makes
me
wonder
whats
holding
up
that
generous
head
that
hangs
on
with
foamy
lacing
no
discernable
smell
creamy
appearance
continues
there
is
a
nectarlike
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
feint
sweet
taste
a
hint
of
hops
but
not
a
lot
by
any
stretch
there
is
just
enough
bitter
to
carry
it
and
youre
left
with
a
mild
nonoffensive
aftertaste
this
is
a
good
one
to
spring
on
your
macrobeer
friends
but
doesnt
offer
much
for
anyone
who
really
likes
english
ales
overall
id
say
its
an
average
beer
with
all
the
outstanding
british
ales
available
theres
not
much
to
particularly
recommend
this
one
comment
another
unremarkable
product
from
our
friends
across
the
pond
despite
my
love
of
ales
i
guess
when
consuming
products
from
the
empire
the
sun
never
set
on
i
will
stick
with
fish
and
chips
this
beer
pours
a
clear
spun
gold
color
the
head
is
small
but
creamy
and
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
but
is
covered
up
by
so
much
by
the
nitro
that
it
is
almost
none
decectable
the
taste
is
only
slightly
more
pronounced
than
the
aroma
it
is
of
citrus
with
a
hint
of
pine
and
a
mild
finishing
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
even
though
the
nitro
tries
to
cover
it
up
overall
this
is
a
disappointment
i
will
not
drink
this
again
this
brew
is
golden
orange
and
has
a
nice
creamy
white
head
i
couldnt
smell
much
of
anything
but
it
has
a
nice
taste
to
it
malty
with
a
hint
of
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
but
also
a
bit
watery
i
need
something
more
it
goes
down
very
smooth
it
would
be
very
easy
to
have
more
than
one
still
a
very
nice
light
bodied
refreshing
simple
beer
it
really
takes
talent
to
make
something
like
this
but
it
could
be
better
i
still
like
it
simple
beer
that
goes
down
easy
could
have
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
this
is
the
easiest
drinking
brew
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
a
great
session
beer
no
doubt
do
not
hesitate
to
try
this
beer
pours
dark
yellow
from
the
can
into
a
glass
a
nice
head
which
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
pleasant
aroma
some
hop
scents
and
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
some
sweet
malt
in
the
flavor
with
some
very
mild
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
again
nothing
to
write
home
about
creamy
mouthfeel
thanks
to
the
nitro
cartridge
in
the
can
nothing
really
objectionable
about
this
beer
just
nothing
too
exciting
either
this
could
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
there
are
lots
of
ales
out
there
with
more
interesting
flavors
sorry
for
the
shameless
plug
d
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
all
that
special
but
would
make
a
good
sessionable
beverage
eh
there
are
worse
things
out
there
d
overall
this
was
pretty
nice
on
a
thursday
night
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
had
i
been
outside
not
at
all
complex
but
whats
there
is
good
appearance
is
a
clear
copper
with
a
thin
but
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
aroma
a
light
hint
of
honey
and
malt
taste
has
light
malt
and
hops
that
seems
watered
down
flat
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
and
creamy
with
light
carbonation
that
makes
for
an
easy
drinker
though
mouthfeel
full
bodied
and
thick
the
nitro
in
this
makes
for
a
beautiful
thick
creamy
longlasting
pure
white
head
and
lacing
in
this
clear
light
copper
ale
not
much
of
a
nose
on
this
maybe
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
some
grassy
floral
notes
very
thin
taste
a
bit
grainy
with
a
lack
of
malt
and
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
helped
by
the
creamy
nitro
but
still
kinda
watery
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
but
kind
of
a
onetrick
pony
the
nitro
drinkability
about
as
close
to
perfect
as
you
can
come
without
quite
being
there
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
remarkable
2
finger
head
the
head
can
definately
hold
its
own
very
sweet
smelling
with
little
to
no
hop
nose
taste
is
almost
honey
sweet
with
a
pleasant
but
not
exceptional
aftertaste
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
cream
ale
drinkablilty
is
very
good
since
this
is
a
very
mild
brew
not
a
regular
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
a
passive
cream
ale
for
occasional
consumption
i
had
a
couple
of
these
yesterday
with
lunch
pours
into
a
creamy
head
very
similar
to
a
goldencolored
guinness
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
flavor
was
slightly
bland
might
have
been
too
cold
to
bring
out
all
the
flavors
as
most
americans
dont
know
that
all
beers
are
not
best
served
icecold
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
give
another
try
at
a
slightly
less
cold
temperature
i
definatly
love
this
beer
many
people
shy
away
from
nitro
beers
but
i
feel
that
it
only
makes
them
easier
to
drink
it
gives
this
beer
a
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
taste
must
try
beautiful
cascading
looks
with
a
tightly
packed
head
golden
color
slight
sweetness
in
the
smell
smooth
creamy
texture
with
hints
of
sweetness
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
that
blend
nicely
with
a
mild
hops
in
the
aftertaste
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
smells
ok
grassy
a
little
skunky
not
sold
on
the
taste
slightly
bitter
id
say
it
actually
leans
towards
malts
rather
than
hops
which
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
not
awful
but
nothing
im
gonna
enjoy
the
nice
thick
creamy
head
keeps
this
from
being
a
disastrous
choice
the
beer
itself
is
quite
watery
and
light
probably
an
ok
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
all
about
the
creaminess
if
this
wasnt
from
england
i
would
call
it
a
cream
ale
i
had
this
with
a
plate
of
hot
wings
and
it
was
pefect
to
tame
the
heat
d
the
complex
yet
mild
taste
and
delicate
carbonation
makes
it
hard
to
resist
chuggin
the
entire
thing
down
i
can
and
have
drank
the
whole
4
pint
can
pack
in
one
sitting
thumbs
up
to
boddingtons
i
hope
they
stick
around
for
another
couple
hundred
years
overall
a
somewhat
generic
beer
i
know
that
pales
generally
are
more
straightforward
in
their
profile
but
i
would
like
to
have
something
try
to
take
centre
stage
and
it
didnt
feel
like
that
was
happening
here
d
its
mildness
makes
for
easy
sipping
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
characteristics
i
look
for
in
a
beer
worth
trying
again
oddly
enough
the
cream
of
manchester
was
one
of
the
earliest
beers
that
brought
me
into
the
specialty
importcraft
beer
fold
now
it
doesnt
seem
to
stack
up
against
other
similar
beers
or
even
the
way
i
used
to
remember
it
1
pint
of
this
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
d
average
in
the
can
but
much
better
on
draft
this
beer
has
sentimental
value
for
me
as
it
reminds
me
of
my
time
living
in
england
it
is
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
still
one
that
i
would
have
no
worries
about
ordering
in
a
pub
or
even
a
can
thx
d
this
beer
wasnt
terrible
but
its
not
bitter
enough
for
me
drinkability
if
i
must
but
i
hope
i
can
get
some
others
to
help
me
finish
this
f
pack
of
cans
d
simply
put
this
is
a
good
decent
beer
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
carbonation
and
balanced
flavor
i
think
that
i
could
handle
at
least
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
its
not
overly
heavy
but
heavy
enough
i
was
definately
satisfied
and
have
come
back
to
it
on
a
few
occasions
already
in
my
short
beer
drinking
career
and
enjoy
it
a
little
more
each
time
an
easy
to
drink
english
pale
but
lacking
in
the
depth
and
complexity
compartment
probably
a
good
session
beer
i
bet
its
better
in
the
pub
the
mouthfeel
is
this
beers
only
saving
grace
if
i
had
to
come
up
with
one
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
certainly
does
not
merit
another
can
in
the
near
future
drinkabity
not
great
but
not
bad
well
worth
a
try
overall
a
personal
favorite
especially
on
draft
the
can
has
a
more
disappointing
feel
you
just
dont
get
the
same
full
head
its
really
hard
to
pour
into
a
pint
glass
immediately
after
opening
minus
points
for
that
on
tap
its
a
different
story
though
flavor
is
satisfyingly
crisp
and
green
and
mouthfeel
is
caresssing
not
a
beer
i
enjoy
would
try
again
in
a
different
serving
type
but
i
wouldnt
be
hoping
for
much
d
this
was
good
i
will
probably
pick
this
up
again
if
i
can
find
it
again
makes
a
fantastic
black
and
tan
when
used
with
a
guinness
nitro
can
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
but
about
right
for
the
style
low
abv
and
smooth
taste
equal
good
drinkability
after
watching
the
ferocious
air
bubbles
from
the
nitro
can
subside
i
observed
a
rich
golden
color
that
is
not
quite
copper
but
looked
similar
to
some
lagers
i
have
seen
the
head
is
creamy
and
tan
the
smell
is
a
hardly
noticible
sweet
englishtype
scent
though
the
flavor
is
quite
watered
down
i
really
liked
it
and
it
tastes
like
pure
malt
very
mild
sweet
and
flat
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
probably
chug
these
all
night
it
would
be
best
to
balance
this
one
out
with
something
more
bitter
because
it
really
does
drink
like
water
this
is
highclass
session
beer
the
only
thing
that
would
limit
drinkability
is
that
honestly
i
might
start
to
want
something
with
a
little
more
chutzpah
as
the
night
progresses
but
thats
just
me
mouthfeel
is
watery
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
though
i
would
prefer
something
with
flavor
if
you
really
have
the
craving
for
a
nitrogenated
bitterpale
ale
go
for
old
speckled
hen
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
1st
time
on
tap
and
find
myself
purchasing
a
4
pack
every
now
and
then
it
has
a
very
weak
aroma
but
it
surprisingly
sweet
its
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
ive
ever
tasted
the
head
filters
smoothly
and
quickly
and
disappears
rather
rapidly
despite
the
sweetness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
it
goes
well
with
spicy
foods
like
a
nice
set
of
boneless
wings
i
have
yet
to
homebrew
this
for
various
reasons
but
highly
recommend
it
most
women
love
this
beer
i
think
because
of
its
sweetness
eric
id
call
it
the
dessert
beer
because
it
was
the
sweetest
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
didnt
find
a
hint
of
bitterness
with
this
beer
imo
its
like
no
other
ale
i
tried
not
to
say
its
the
best
ale
but
in
my
experience
its
the
most
original
so
far
despite
the
overpowering
malt
sweetness
i
think
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
all
in
all
this
it
the
best
hisspop
nitrothingy
beer
ive
tasted
so
far
this
beer
was
very
interesting
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
very
thick
at
first
it
poured
an
opaque
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
after
the
few
minutes
the
body
became
clearer
as
the
beer
began
to
settle
once
the
body
of
the
beer
settles
the
head
has
good
retention
and
the
body
becomes
a
nice
dark
amber
color
the
smell
was
farily
malty
although
not
overbearing
the
taste
was
nice
and
smooth
going
down
with
malts
very
prevalent
almost
as
abrasively
malty
as
a
malt
liquor
beer
but
not
as
pungent
or
acidic
a
nice
thikc
mouthfeel
that
was
reminiscent
of
a
guinness
not
the
one
straight
from
the
tap
in
dublin
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
type
of
a
beer
you
can
drink
all
night
and
not
even
worry
about
it
despite
the
thickness
and
malty
characteristics
not
too
filling
this
is
my
bmc
killer
when
i
want
a
smooth
cold
somewhat
watery
beer
that
i
can
chug
mercilessly
this
is
it
right
here
i
know
that
doesnt
sound
like
a
ringing
endorsement
but
to
me
there
are
different
beers
that
serve
different
roles
and
this
beer
fills
its
role
with
aplomb
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
very
much
a
session
pint
and
a
good
drink
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
tried
this
in
a
nitrocan
i
still
dont
have
the
guinness
perfect
pour
down
but
these
boddingtons
cans
makes
it
a
cinch
pours
completely
head
settles
over
the
course
of
23
minutes
to
a
14
inch
very
creamy
very
sturdy
head
almost
pure
white
in
color
the
beer
itself
is
a
golden
coppery
color
mostly
clear
just
the
slightest
hint
of
opacity
smell
is
malty
hoppy
smells
very
much
like
an
ale
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
scent
though
the
unbelievably
creamy
mouthfeel
tricks
the
mind
into
sensing
more
maltiness
than
is
probably
there
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
rich
like
cream
and
amazingly
thick
for
an
ale
the
drinkability
is
good
im
personally
not
a
huge
fan
of
ales
in
general
so
its
not
quite
my
favorite
but
the
mouthfeel
really
brings
it
together
quite
a
bit
im
sure
for
an
ale
lover
this
would
be
a
musthave
pours
a
very
clear
slightly
copper
color
with
a
thick
soapy
white
head
and
the
classic
nitro
cascading
bubbles
lots
of
little
bubbles
clinging
to
the
glass
nice
head
retention
relatively
fresh
smelling
smells
a
bit
of
yeast
and
malt
not
alot
of
hop
presence
nice
maltiness
to
the
taste
i
wish
it
had
more
hops
to
balance
it
out
very
creamy
mouthfeel
an
interesting
beer
for
me
to
try
but
i
wish
it
had
more
flavor
i
hadnt
ever
tried
this
beer
but
we
were
at
a
highpriced
restaurant
for
dinner
and
this
seemed
like
the
best
offering
from
their
beer
list
it
is
rather
pretty
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
very
thick
white
head
mostly
nondescript
thereafter
a
mild
grain
aroma
somewhat
sweet
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
but
it
was
refreshing
and
i
would
imagine
it
to
be
sessionable
this
is
actually
the
first
time
ive
ever
tried
this
beer
i
think
i
am
really
suprised
the
beer
practically
bursts
out
of
the
can
upon
opening
and
when
poured
produces
a
super
creamy
white
head
tiny
bubbles
float
to
the
top
giving
it
nice
eye
appeal
the
smell
has
something
to
be
desired
a
cross
between
beer
and
cat
urine
definitly
not
a
great
smell
but
100
times
better
than
some
american
macros
ive
tried
the
taste
is
very
creamy
very
smooth
i
can
definitly
feel
the
pub
style
thing
going
on
if
you
close
your
eyes
youre
almost
there
very
mellow
flavors
very
sessionable
i
definitly
dig
the
nitro
version
of
this
more
than
the
guinness
nitro
if
the
two
can
be
compared
i
like
this
stuff
it
was
what
i
expected
it
to
be
for
a
pubstyle
ale
i
drank
it
from
the
can
so
i
cant
say
much
about
appearance
the
head
was
very
creamy
though
it
smells
a
little
bitter
but
in
a
good
way
i
could
definitely
buy
a
4pack
and
enjoy
them
through
the
night
when
drinking
it
it
makes
you
feel
like
youre
in
an
english
pub
its
a
smooth
very
drinkable
pale
ale
and
has
just
the
right
bitterness
authentic
and
enjoyable
pick
it
up
d
certainly
could
be
worse
but
for
someone
looking
for
a
lot
of
varying
aromas
or
flavors
it
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
to
offer
yet
nonetheless
i
certainly
found
it
drinkable
and
would
have
no
problem
drinking
another
this
beer
looks
much
better
than
it
tastes
or
smells
it
produces
a
rich
creamy
looking
head
from
the
nitro
wigit
and
the
body
is
golden
with
a
slight
amount
of
haze
this
pub
ale
smells
very
metallic
and
thats
pretty
much
it
it
seems
to
have
a
slight
ginger
taste
something
i
find
unique
lastly
for
an
ale
this
tastes
a
bit
lagery
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
will
order
this
one
again
and
not
just
to
amuse
the
local
bar
flys
overall
an
eh
beer
cause
theres
not
much
there
there
realiable
and
dependably
boring
drinkability
as
its
called

pub
ale
means
a
nice
session
beer
to
have
while
talking
it
up
at
the
pub
just
wish
there
was
some
aroma
here
virtually
no
aroma
here
slight
maltiness
no
hop
scent
the
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
crispness
at
the
end
not
really
a
hop
character
to
me
but
a
definite
finish
to
the
taste
is
present
as
much
as
i
love
the
nitro
can
widget
i
have
to
say
that
on
tap
there
is
absolutely
no
offflavor
present
that
the
widget
can
sometimes
provide
d
to
much
cane
sugar
in
the
grist
most
likely
caused
the
cider
aroma
and
thinned
out
the
body
the
metallic
taste
could
only
come
from
the
can
so
im
not
sure
if
the
aluminum
was
exposed
or
just
a
poorly
crafted
can
honestly
it
was
just
awful
d
bland
mouthfeel
detracts
the
mild
flavour
and
light
feel
make
it
easy
enough
to
down
would
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
intend
to
ever
buy
again
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
always
nice
to
watch
the
nitros
settle
in
my
opinion
although
this
isnt
as
nice
as
the
stouts
aroma
is
faint
with
a
little
fruit
in
there
taste
is
a
little
malty
and
more
of
the
fruit
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
little
carbonation
as
typical
of
the
nitro
this
is
an
easy
drinker
decent
towards
the
end
of
a
session
nothing
spectacular
here
just
an
easy
drinking
low
flavor
pale
ale
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
well
balanced
and
deadon
for
the
style
not
sure
if
the
nitro
can
affected
the
clarity
or
what
im
assuming
they
filter
this
beer
but
the
clarity
was
pretty
dull
on
this
one
nothing
outstanding
but
its
beer
i
guess
thats
why
its
an
ordinary
bitter
lives
up
to
its
classification
and
then
my
opinion
began
to
fade
a
bit
this
beer
smelled
like
nothing
taste
was
also
very
mild
and
dare
i
say
it
boring
mouthfeel
was
extremely
flat
particularly
given
how
much
head
this
beer
initially
had
i
feel
like
theres
an
appeal
that
im
not
detecting
but
as
it
was
i
thought
it
was
pretty
marginal
a
very
bland
beer
and
not
nearly
what
i
expected
have
had
this
several
times
initially
when
i
didnt
know
any
better
i
was
a
bit
taken
by
it
the
color
is
a
pale
pale
translucent
yellow
this
has
a
massive
head
due
to
the
nitro
it
just
comes
pouring
out
while
this
is
pleasing
to
watch
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
using
the
nitro
is
cheating
this
had
a
weak
smell
faint
hops
and
esters
the
taste
was
fairly
bland
creamy
and
buttery
not
very
complex
at
all
the
nitro
again
helped
out
with
the
mouthfeel
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
something
with
this
much
carbonation
however
there
are
better
beers
to
go
to
then
this
16
oz
tall
nitrowidget
can
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
is
exceptional
it
has
that
creamy
feel
to
it
that
helps
it
go
down
better
the
flavor
is
of
honey
and
light
fruit
its
very
hard
to
find
a
flavorful
thick
beer
around
here
and
this
is
definitely
that
i
dont
understand
why
the
rating
on
this
site
isnt
a
little
bit
higher
pintsized
nitrocan
served
in
a
nonic
after
pouring
it
cascades
for
awhile
and
settles
to
an
unfiltered
almost
lifeless
light
amber
that
is
topped
with
a
thick
inch
of
dense
cream
head
that
leaves
heavy
sheets
of
lacing
and
retains
a
halfinch
throughout
the
aroma
is
light
sweet
and
doughy
with
hints
of
caramelbubblegum
and
maybe
some
fruits
pear
the
flavor
adds
to
this
only
hints
of
leafygreen
hops
and
the
beer
is
light
in
body
carbonation
and
finish
but
it
is
fairly
smooth
seem
to
remember
it
being
a
little
better
than
this
definitely
not
seeking
it
out
again
i
generally
will
not
buy
beer
in
a
can
because
of
that
tinny
taste
that
it
lends
the
beer
this
one
is
quite
bitter
and
void
of
malty
sweetness
so
perhaps
that
masks
that
quality
one
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
the
nitrous
which
makes
it
truly
creamy
its
not
the
most
amazing
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
very
pleasant
its
comforting
like
a
mashed
potatoes
d
id
have
a
few
as
the
lower
abv
and
the
decent
taste
make
it
a
good
one
to
have
when
you
are
having
a
few
cheers
excellent
readily
available
pale
ale
pop
the
top
and
pour
quickly
for
a
good

with
an
fullbodied
hearty
taste
pours

and
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
pleasant
crisp
smell
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
with
the
4
7
abv
and
its
a
pleasant
everyday
ale
great
with
a
meal
pours

it

with
noticeable
but
not
prominant

in
the
finish
medium
light
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
clearly
well
made
but
its
not
very
interesting
drinkability
is
decent
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
highly
sessionable
and
drinkable
beer
an
honest
working
class
british
brew
i
will
buy
it
again
pours
a
creamy
yellow
white
color
before
the
nitrogen
head
separates
after
that
its
got
that
thick
tenacious
nitro
head
bone
white
atop
a
very
clear
light
orange
amber
body
the
nose
features
some
banana
notes
cooked
grains
and
mild
caramel
malts
on
the
palate
theres
a
touch
of
carbonation
first
off
then
mild
slightly
sour
pale
malts
and
a
dry
biscuity
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
light
but
not
to
my
mind
in
a
bad
way
it
just
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
good
out
of
the
can
as
it
is
on
draft
but
its
still
a
decent
session
beer
it
was
happy
hour
and
i
figured
this
would
be
a
better
way
to
try
this
beer
than
buying
a
4
pack
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
retention
almost
no
smell
and
what
there
was
just
reminded
me
of
stale
bread
taste
was
very
light
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
couldnt
make
out
any
grain
but
at
least
it
was
inoffensive
and
washed
down
my
food
the
taste
is
not
overwhelming
either
it
is
more
bitter
than
anything
with
a
pretty
strong
aftertaste
there
is
a
malt
balance
but
its
muted
its
not
offensive
but
its
not
anything
special
either
pretty
average
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
overall
this
beer
is
nicer
to
look
at
than
to
drink
i
dont
know
how
many
i
would
have
of
these
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
worth
at
least
that
beer
pours
cloudy
thanks
to
the
nitro
its
a
very
light
goldyellow
and
a
head
which
sticks
around
again
thanks
to
the
nitro
smell
is
slightly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
light
i
would
compare
this
to
a
vanilla
guinness
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
british
beer
ill
be
returning
to
d
this
is
pretty
much
as
quaffable
as
a
beer
can
be
unfortunately
it
isnt
a
bit
more
refreshing
and
it
has
virtually
no
flavor
it
is
easy
for
something
to
be
drinkable
with
no
flavor
drinkability
im
sure
its
easy
to
chug
a
pint
of
boddies
but
its
not
particularly
exciting
to
sip
and
i
have
no
desire
to
pick
up
another
fourpack
d
quite
good
overall
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
session
there
is
not
anything
offensive
but
also
not
much
to
impress
it
is
much
like
most
other
nitro
beersit
looks
great
but
things
are
downhill
after
that
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
head
that
formed
after
the
cascading
effect
of
the
nitrocan
the
smell
is
a
bit
floral
and
malty
the
taste
is
bitter
but
not
overpowering
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
but
not
chewy
i
find
this
to
be
a
delightful
beer
which
i
have
enjoyed
on
many
occasions
and
hope
to
do
so
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
session
the
beer
pours
into
a
gorgeous
cascading
whirlpool
of
goodness
it
really
is
a
sight
the
head
is
snow
white
and
thick
it
never
lets
up
throughout
the
whole
journey
unfortunately
its
the
best
thing
about
the
ale
the
smell
is
kind
of
wheaty
like
budweiser
or
miller
not
that
bad
but
not
much
better
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
in
my
opinion
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
it
has
a
slight
hoppy
taste
and
a
pretty
strong
apple
taste
its
fruity
but
not
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
guiness
but
i
prefer
guiness
its
a
refreshing
beer
easy
to
drink
and
above
average
not
all
that
special
though
da
good
feel
not
so
great
flavor
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
go
through
a
few
of
them
tastes
much
much
better
off
tap
this
beers
cascade
effect
rivals
that
of
guinnesss
which
as
you
may
know
is
quite
a
feat
it
pours
a
creamy
white
liquid
that
slowly
and
wavily
transforms
into
a
golden
translucent
lager
the
smell
is
non
existant
the
taste
is
big
and
much
like
what
youd
think
a
cream
ale
would
be
lots
of
body
to
it
which
is
thick
to
move
your
tongue
through
a
foamy
head
stays
on
for
the
duration
of
this
beer
even
when
the
liquid
itself
has
been
finished
a
great
example
of
a
cream
ale
utterly
still
golden
amber
with
a
thick
and
dense
milkwhite
nitroinduced
head
the
head
is
going
nowhere
fast
and
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
splotchy
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
melon
green
apple
floral
hops
and
a
light
presence
of
caramel
malts
pleasant
flavors
of
fresh
plum
juice
honeydew
and
a
hint
of
banana
mix
with
barelythere
biscuity
malt
and
a
nicely
contrasting
bitter
bergamotinfused
hop
finish
a
little
bit
of
mineral
character
comes
through
in
the
finish
as
well
hop
bitterness
lingers
as
it
warms
this
hop
flavor
begins
to
resemble
the
spiciness
of
saaz
its
surprising
how
much
this
tastes
like
an
english
attempt
at
a
belgian
pale
thin
mouthfeel
really
makes
this
a
closebutnocigar
semblance
of
a
cask
ale
actually
its
nowhere
near
the
flavor
or
consistency
of
a
cask
ale
but
the
nitro
widget
is
put
to
what
is
likely
its
maximum
performance
here
a
quality
beer
in
my
book
i
really
enjoy
boddingtons
i
have
had
it
in
a
pint
sized
nitro
can
that
one
must
take
care
when
opening
i
learned
the
hard
way
beer
on
the
poker
table
anyhow
a
fine
gold
in
color
with
a
one
to
two
fingered
head
very
creamy
in
both
taste
and
smell
very
easy
drinking
it
goes
down
easy
cheers
what
a
great
over
all
drinking
beer
the
nitrogen
makes
it
taste
like
a
milk
shake
honey
flavor
was
detected
as
well
as
coffee
i
could
just
see
going
to
a
pub
in
england
and
sharing
this
brew
in
a
tall
mug
with
my
good
buddys
the
big
yellow
can
stands
out
in
the
crowd
of
boring
drab
colored
beers
pour
a
cold
one
and
watch
the
giant
head
vanish
before
your
eyes
drinkability
i
could
drink
about
eight
with
out
trouble
but
any
more
i
may
fall
a
few
times
pours
a
nice
nitro
style
orange
nose
is
fruity
apples
and
pears
slight
biscuit
medium
bodied
but
the
nitro
gives
it
a
watery
creamy
feel
decent
enough
taste
for
the
style
fruity
apples
and
pears
with
a
subtle
biscuity
maltiness
finishes
dry
low
hops
more
of
a
mild
in
my
opinion
decent
enough
but
nothing
ill
buy
again
pours
honey
golden
yellow
with
typical
nitrostyle
can
head
the
head
is
very
dense
creamy
and
leaves
belgian
lacing
all
the
way
down
to
the
end
smells
mild
overall
but
has
an
weak
clove
and
honey
aroma
tastes
very
watery
low
ratings
on
taste
and
mouth
feel
reflect
the
lack
of
flavor
rather
than
bad
flavor
when
i
opened
this
beer
it
gushed
out
all
over
the
counter
i
guess
thats
why
it
says
carefully
open
on
the
back
of
the
can
get
my
buzz
on
n
on
tap
at
fionn
maccools
in
jacksonville
beach
straw
yellow
hazed
from
streaming
bubbles
huge
head
aroma
was
very
mild
and
almost
all
malt
taste
was
similar
mild
malt
with
a
soft
hop
balance
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
medium
body
although
this
probably
was
due
to
the
high
carbonation
overall
quite
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
nothing
to
excite
you
from
a
taste
standpoint
the
flavor
is
interesting
there
is
no
complexity
whatsoever
to
this
beer
there
is
no
chemistry
on
the
tongue
or
the
palletjust
a
consistant
creamy
taste
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
for
some
reason
maybe
its
the
presentation
i
have
also
had
it
at
the
bar
and
i
can
say
it
tastes
better
when
being
pumped
from
a
hand
pump
cask
style
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
wellbalanced
brew
it
is
sweet
creamy
and
unoffensive
especially
when
consumed
around
the
lower
temp
range
i
found
it
best
around
40f
sessionable
if
you
like
english
ales
if
you
can
find
it
and
lets
be
honest
if
this
is
available
in
nz
its
available
everywhere
give
it
a
go
drinkability
this
goes
with
about
anything
its
not
a
strong
dark
beer
its
not
overly
dark
and
was
liked
even
by
the
partygoers
who
are
more
lightale
or
even
usfodder
fans
boddingtons
has
been
enjoyed
by
beer
drinkers
in
england
for
more
than
200
years
and
is
well
known
for
its
creamy
head
and
smooth
body
it
is
now
sold
in
over
30
countries
worldwide
and
can
be
drunk
on
tap
in
places
as
far
afield
as
new
zealand
and
hong
kong
boddingtons
is
positioned
as
a
premium
import
in
its
overseas
markets
and
this
sector
has
seen
rapid
growth
in
the
last
ten
years
as
drinkers
are
keen
to
experiment
with
different
beer
styles
and
tastes
and
often
drink
beers
they
remember
from
places
they
have
traveled
to
personally
i
find
it
slightly
sweet
and
mild
not
a
beer
of
choice
but
worth
a
shot
drinkability
with
no
overpowering
flavors
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
it
certainly
is
much
better
on
tap
i
have
had
these
out
at
bars
and
remembered
enjoying
them
much
more
overall
the
can
is
a
disappointment
drinkability
this
is
not
very
good
so
its
not
sessionable
d
this
is
good
session
beer
if
youre
into
the
taste
it
goes
down
easy
and
isnt
too
filling
but
i
found
the
taste
and
kick
lacking
pretty
significantly
boddingtons
when
you
get
down
to
it
is
just
downright
nasty
it
looks
good
pours
an
awesome
crème
head
with
a
sort
of
horse
piss
looking
body
the
smell
is
interesting
a
little
buttery
but
not
much
else
taste
is
just
t
awkward
its
creamy
offensive
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
i
keep
giving
it
chances
to
win
me
over
but
every
time
i
try
before
i
finish
a
pint
it
hits
my
yacking
mechanism
its
much
better
to
start
out
drinking
this
because
if
you
have
any
other
beer
before
this
it
reminds
you
of
milk
the
mouthfeel
is
typical
nitro
flat
fluff
the
drinkability
is
just
gross
i
still
cant
get
used
to
it
dont
know
how
the
brits
drink
it
but
i
gotta
hand
it
to
them
blokes
for
staying
with
it
a
good
session
beer
and
one
thats
readily
available
poured
from
a
yellow
nitro
can
complete
with
serving
instructions
on
the
label
appearance
is
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
full
thick
bright
white
head
that
slowly
fell
to
about
a
half
finger
that
lingered
the
duration
of
the
pint
glass
smells
light
and
mild
very
light
nose
mostly
sweet
and
light
aromas
of
grain
and
malt
taste
is
also
mild
and
has
a
light
bready
sweetness
similar
to
light
honey
and
wheat
has
a
light
bitterness
about
it
in
the
start
and
finish
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
slippery
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
low
levels
of
carbonation
pairs
well
with
this
beers
lighter
body
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
excellent
smoothness
and
refreshing
characteristics
that
make
this
an
ideal
easy
drinker
although
practically
every
characteristic
of
this
beer
could
be
considered
light
and
far
from
outstanding
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
to
find
anywhere
beer
is
sold
drinkability
i
would
recommend
this
to
others
but
in
mild
doses
relatively
bland
compared
to
other
flavorful
beers
that
ive
tried
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
nitrocan
so
i
jumped
on
the
opportunity
to
try
it
on
draft
at
cobblestones
in
york
pa
set
in
front
of
me
with
all
but
an
inch
being
creamy
upside
down
waterfall
head
beautiful
the
smell
is
slightly
bitter
nothing
extraordinary
when
the
head
finally
settled
to
an
inch
or
two
the
first
sip
is
deep
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
more
berrylike
finish
than
the
canned
version
i
love
the
mustache
people
get
when
drinking
this
beer
as
drinkable
as
water
you
can
really
throw
these
down
if
you
want
to
you
dont
much
feel
the
alchohol
until
the
second
or
third
boddingtons
as
it
comes
on
rather
smooth
if
you
like
the
can
youll
love
the
draft

down

great
example
of
english
ale
cool
yellow
nitrocan
pours
a
crisp
and
lively
amber
color
starting
as
all

the
head
is
epic
in

modest

a

bready
and
a

and

carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
beeers
ive
had
in
a
can
anyway
very
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
worth
a
try
for
sure
for
such
a
popular
ale
this
is
quite
a
disappointment
granted
its
not
bad
but
its
fairly
dull
give
it
a
try
if
youre
curious
if
you
prefer
a
beer
with
lighter
flavor
this
might
be
for
you
otherwise
its
hardly
a
beer
youll
come
back
to
boddingtons
pub
ale
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
white
head
after
a
typical
nitro
pour
from
a
one
pint
can
i
really
just
cant
smell
anything
might
as
well
not
have
anything
in
my
glass
from
the
aroma
some
caramel
flavors
but
also
tannicwoody
like
flavors
to
finish
it
off
hops
are
slightly
noticeable
but
not
a
major
component
creamy
head
and
silky
texture
from
the
nitro
worth
a
try
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
consider
it
a
guilty
pleasure
i
takes
the
place
of
guinness
in
the
summer
i
suggest
this
as
the
first
step
to
get
some
one
off
bud
miller
etc
onto
real
beer
boddingtons
advertises
itself
as
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
definitely
true
and
the
one
redeeming
characteristic
of
this
beer
this
stuff
actually
seems
like
the
british
equivalent
of
our
bmc
though
they
do
a
much
much
better
job
than
ab
coors
and
the
like
though
thats
not
saying
much
good
session
beer
but
for
the
same
price
id
much
rather
grab
a
tetleys
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
id
prefer
it
on
tap
but
boddingtons
pub
ale
is
a
respectable
little
brew
mild
creamy
and
smooth
its
perhaps
the
antithesis
of
what
most
beeradvocates
are
looking
for
but
a
good
occasional
treat
nonetheless
16
ounce
nitro
can
pours
a
beautiful
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
lingers
gracefully
in
the
glass
some
sticky
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
after
every
sip
aroma
is
of
mild
sweet
malt
taste
is
mild
and
slightly
sweet
with
just
touch
of
hop
bitterness
i
think
i
will
have
another
drinkability
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
its
balanced
body
not
too
thick
not
too
light
sizeable
head
excellent
lacing
smooth
taste
and
moderate
alcohol
content
make
it
a
respectable
pale
ale
its
amazing
what
nitro
can
do
to
an
otherwise
boring
beer
as
with
all
nitros
this
has
incredible
thickness
and
creaminess
in
the
head
ive
never
had
a
beer
to
lace
better
as
for
a
pub
ale
its
lightly
hazy
and
medium
straw
coloredi
expected
more
copper
color
aromas
are
extremely
faint
but
i
can
pick
up
some
light
malt
corn
and
a
little
sourness
tastes
are
fairly
muted
as
well
but
do
pick
up
on
some
subtle
sweetness
corn
sugar
and
maybe
some
other
cereal
grains
light
souring
from
fermentation
provides
a
bit
of
granny
smith
apple
flavor
thats
basically
it
not
much
more
exciting
than
budweiser
but
the
mouthfeel
is
where
it
is
at
creamy
and
full
feeling
almost
chewey
finishes
wet
and
fleeting
dangerously
close
to
watering
down
my
advice
drink
it
quickly
because
after
the
nitro
disipates
this
beer
gets
boring
in
a
hurry
d
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
too
easy
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
the
pour
was
the
best
part
but
there
isnt
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
good
to
have
when
youre
having
more
than
one
i
guess
cheers
drinkable
while
it
doesnt
win
many
points
for
taste
i
have
to
admit
that
boddingtons
really
just
slides
down
my
gullet
its
a
light
weak
watery
beer
that
looks
real
pretty
if
quantity
is
your
thing
then
boddingtons
may
be
also
a
curious
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
but
mostly
just
watery
and
thin
little
to
no
bite
on
the
tongue
you
could
almost
drink
this
like
water
but
it
would
be
about
as
exciting
there
are
great
qualities
about
this
brew
but
its
inconsistencies
are
unpleasant
theres
a
lot
better
epas
out
there
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
there
is
a
lack
of
any
flavors
that
make
me
want
to
continue
drinking
this
there
is
also
a
vague
graininess
that
doesnt
seem
like
it
should
be
there
it
should
be
a
bit
more
clean
tiny
bitter
finish
is
barely
enough
for
an
enjoyment
this
is
a
palate
cleanser
for
me
goes
down
easy
doesnt
necessarily
taste
bad
but
theres
nothing
to
make
me
want
another
either
i
really
did
not
like
this
it
just
seemed
extremely
watery
i
dont
think
this
had
any
carbonation
whatsoever
maybe
it
was
flat
who
knows
but
even
if
i
got
a
bad
brew
i
dont
see
how
this
would
possibly
be
something
id
get
time
and
time
again
i
could
taste
the
hops
towards
the
middle
but
the
beer
got
pretty
nasty
towards
the
bottom
i
would
never
drink
this
again
unless
it
was
free
im
kind
of
upset
i
bought
this
drinkability
a
little
to
bitter
without
the
sweetness
or
taste
to
balance
it
out
drinkability
drinkable
yes
sessionable
yes
memorable
no
i
purchased
one
can
to
try
for
2
im
not
disappointed
i
gave
this
a
shot
but
i
probably
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
boddingtons
pub
ale
has
a
time
and
a
place
unfortunatly
that
place
in
not
at
the
top
of
a
bas
list
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
pretty
cool
the
nice
cascading
pour
and
the
crisp
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
is
when
the
novelty
wears
off
taste
is
of
an
ale
thats
pale
but
not
the
other
way
around
slight
hoppy
aroma
and
flavor
but
nothing
that
jumps
out
at
you
a
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
more
grainy
and
anything
it
tastes
sort
of
watered
down
they
have
this
at
one
of
my
favourite
downtown
bars
on
tap
brits
pub
and
i
can
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
down
there
when
i
am
out
for
a
night
but
for
someone
trying
to
enjoy
a
beer
at
home
well
next
notes
ill
pass
on
this
one
and
ill
pass
on
almost
every
english
pale
drinkability
this
was
frankly
almost
unbearable
to
drink
as
i
had
better
choices
in
the
fridge
hopefully
you
have
better
choices
than
this
beer
i
will
not
purchase
this
again
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
maybe
a
bit
low
in
the
flavour
profile
despite
its
lack
of
substantial
taste
it
is
really
quite
drinkable
nothing
offensive
in
either
just
a
creamy
taste
and
feeling
dthis
beer
is
really
smooth
with
low
carbonation
i
guess
that
is
due
to
the
nitro
canits
style
i
could
not
drink
alot
of
it
but
i
know
many
people
who
can
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
ale
one
of
the
best
smooth
pale
ales
ive
ever
had
i
ordered
a
pint
at
the
pub
and
i
was
really
glad
to
see
the
thick
head
that
would
last
till
the
very
last
sip
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
its
really
easy
to
drink
there
wasnt
much
hop
presence
or
bitterness
at
all
although
i
could
sense
a
slight
bitterness
after
a
few
sec
the
sweet
malt
was
very
inviting
but
probably
not
strong
enough
for
experienced
drinkers
a
very
good
pub
ale
though
this
is
a
good
drinkable
ale
its
so
creamy
and
smooth
and
perhaps
watery
you
almost
dont
notice
it
going
down
great
foamy
head
good
golden
look
smell
and
taste
well
not
very
strong
its
a
great
beer
to
start
or
finish
with
cuz
itll
either
get
you
into
the
flow
of
things
or
cleanse
your
palate
its
kind
of
like
a
mouthwash
if
you
will
which
probably
isnt
the
kindest
description
but
apt
none
the
less
overall
an
average
ale
saved
by
mediocrity
by
virtue
of
its
nitro
head
definitely
a
good
session
beer
its
not
very
exciting
but
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
drinkability
since
there
was
little
flavor
in
this
you
can
probably
chug
a
couple
down
if
you
wanted
to
everything
except
for
the
appearance
was
just
bad
i
wont
spend
another
2
for
this
beer
again
d
easily
downed
and
very
light
now
if
someone
would
please
show
me
how
to
play
poker
overall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
the
best
beer
ever
but
it
seems
to
be
a
good
sessioner
and
would
probably
make
for
an
inoffensive
beer
to
serve
to
someone
only
used
to
bud
and
miller
the
nitro
might
be
taking
a
lot
of
the
flavor
from
the
beer
id
be
interested
in
trying
it
ontap
at
some
point
d
not
much
to
make
me
want
more
of
this
but
for
a
person
who
wants
to
sit
for
a
long
session
and
not
wear
out
their
palate
this
c
ould
be
ok
overall
this
is
a
nice
kick
back
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
would
be
nice
to
have
while
doing
yard
work
best
widget
beer
ive
tried
recommended
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
it
is
very
clean
tating
especially
from
a
can
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
nitro
tap
poured
from
the
nitro
can
with
a
thin
body
and
very
thick
creamy
head
the
head
was
white
and
creamy
as
hell
and
the
body
was
a
shade
lighter
than
the
average
pale
ale
but
still
ambery
and
stuff
smells
like
alkaline
water
grain
and
light
floral
hops
with
an
equal
mix
of
bittering
hops
the
mouth
is
smooth
very
light
hops
light
malt
just
an
all
around
good
drinking
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
im
going
to
be
looking
out
for
in
the
future
nitro
can
poured
a
beautiful
white
head
that
is
sustaining
very
well
nose
is
of
very
faint
graininess
and
not
much
else
taste
is
of
british
water
grains
and
finishes
with
a
decent
bittering
hop
mouthfeel
is
extremely
creamy
topnotch
but
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
definitely
a
session
beer
that
is
creamy
smooth
worth
a
try
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
body
is
below
medium
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
pour
and
a
somewhat
thin
texture
with
medium
drinkability
final
verdict
meh
if
its
around
ill
drink
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
these
nitrocapsules
arent
really
a
good
idea
when
youre
talking
about
taste
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
cream
color
that
quicly
clears
up
into
a
golden
color
with
a
creamy
head
there
is
a
slight
smell
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
like
a
watered
down
ipa
it
has
a
certain
degree
of
bite
with
it
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
bitter
a
lasting
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
less
than
desireable
the
drinkability
is
average
but
this
is
not
a
beer
i
will
likely
purchase
again
the
overall
flavor
is
good
but
with
a
metallic
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
really
the
only
real
fault
this
beer
has
in
my
opinion
great
color
and
appearance
add
to
the
overall
rating
fairly
drinkable
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
if
not
for
the
aftertaste
pours
deep
gold
with
a
slightly
imperfect
clarity
an
eggshell
colored
head
of
whipped
cream
consistency
shows
the
typical
nitrocan
retention
abundant
lacing
creates
a
jigsaw
pattern
of
lace
a
winey
aroma
can
be
detected
in
the
background
accompanied
by
pale
malt
and
fuggles
hops
a
very
even
balance
of
sweet
pale
malt
and
fuggles
is
the
foundation
of
the
taste
but
an
annoying
vinous
flavor
is
apparent
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
swig
simple
but
pleasent
taste
and
appropriate
to
style
a
fruity
ester
appears
in
the
aftertaste
only
as
it
warms
the
nitro
creates
a
flat
carbonation
but
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
in
the
medium
body
and
boosts
the
drinkability
however
the
finish
is
slick
and
the
acidic
vinous
character
ruin
the
overall
presentation
and
knock
this
out
of
contention
for
a
good
session
ale
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
smell
department
but
nothing
bad
either
thats
probably
this
beers
weakest
point
tastes
of
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
is
where
boddingtons
really
shines
creamy
i
often
find
myself
drinking
these
faster
than
i
should
to
get
the
creaminess
out
of
that
middle
layer
before
it
settles
out
this
time
i
took
my
time
and
it
does
lose
something
if
you
wait
too
long
and
miss
that
creamyness
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
its
a
consistent
tasty
and
reliable
beer
pours
a
very
clear
golden
yellow
witha
big
foamy
white
head
that
settles
and
laces
the
glass
nicely
very
faint
aromas
traces
of
some
sweetness
honey
and
some
hoppyfloral
aromas
as
well
mild
in
taste
more
of
the
same
a
little
sweetness
a
little
bitterness
but
overall
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
definately
the
highlight
of
the
beer
and
why
i
regularly
return
to
it
very
drinkable
the
mild
taste
and
nice
mouthfeel
make
this
this
beer
nothing
too
special
but
it
is
nice
too
drink
not
one
of
my
alltime
favourites
or
the
best
in
the
world
but
i
would
recommend
it
benjamin
franklin
to
me
boddingtons
is
the
caramel
version
of
the
chocolate
guinness
if
that
makes
sense
from
the
cascade
to
the
head
consistency
the
feel
in
the
mouth
to
the
fairly
intense
lacing
theyre
very
similar
its
a
smooth
and
very
drinkable
beer
that
you
can
just
put
down
without
even
realizing
the
appearance
is
simple
but
pleasant
with
a
light
honey
color
the
head
is
thick
and
marshmallow
like
and
it
just
wont
go
away
not
much
of
a
nose
which
would
probably
be
its
biggest
problem
this
is
a
classic
though
and
because
of
that
its
not
the
most
complex
its
a
staple
not
something
that
pushes
the
boundaries
and
it
should
be
appreciated
as
such
its
best
on
draught
and
pairs
well
with
many
deserts
picked
up
a
nicely
chilled
4
pack
popped
the
top
and
got
a
great
surge
that
i
poured
into
a
goblet
what
a
cool
2
stage
head
creamy
white
top
off
white
center
and
cloudy
golden
ale
on
the
bottom
very
creamy
head
ale
smells
hoppy
the
head
sticks
strongly
to
the
side
of
the
goblet
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
great
carbonation
the
sweet
flavor
shoots
right
down
the
center
of
the
mouth
and
the
finish
is
strong
but
reserved
this
is
a
very
creamy
and
tasty
ale
i
have
tanked
down
quite
a
few
of
these
ales
in
the
past
but
now
i
am
finally
reviewing
i
recommend
need
to
try
it
topping
a
nice
thick
stout
drinkability
well
i
must
say
i
have
found
a
new
session
beer
this
could
be
drank
by
the
case
pours
out
a
foamed
up
nitro
concotion
that
loses
its
carbonated
look
quickly
turns
to
a
goldamber
clear
brew
with
a
1
finger
head
has
a
yeast
type
smell
to
it
not
much
else
very
neutral
tastingslightly
sweetkinda
watery
but
in
reality
not
too
bada
summery
beer
mouthfeel
there
is
none
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
da
nice
light
ale
that
i
could
drink
several
of
very
smooth
creamy
and
light
it
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
very
low
carbonation
with
a
light
body
quite
creamy
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
go
down
smooth
while
it
is
not
a
particularly
interesting
or
complex
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
if
stuck
in
a
bar
with
a
limited
selection
and
hanging
around
with
friends
thats
how
i
ended
up
with
it
it
does
pour
nice
into
a
pint
glass
and
settles
also
very
nicely
taste
seems
to
be
greatly
affected
by
temp
more
so
than
other
beers
and
ales
if
this
is
chilled
just
to
much
it
seems
to
lose
all
its
flavor
when
at
the
correct
serving
temp
it
does
have
a
nice
taste
to
it
this
is
my
oh
why
did
i
drink
so
much
of
insert
beer
name
here
last
night
beer
it
is
a
very
silky
drink
and
much
easier
going
down
if
you
had
a
few
to
many
of
a
mass
produced
beer
the
night
before
nothing
amazing
here
but
nothing
offending
either
at
7
99us
for
a
4pack
you
can
probably
do
a
lot
better
pours
a
medium
golden
yellow
with
the
classic
nitro
precipitation
that
settles
into
a
tight
uniform
white
head
that
doesnt
dissipate
the
whole
way
down
and
leaves
substantial
lacing
smell
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
the
downside
of
the
nitro
injection
looks
fabulous
but
tends
to
impact
the
smell
and
taste
anyway
what
there
is
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
grains
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
malty
with
a
burnt
overtone
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
but
kind
of
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nice
looking
english
pale
although
a
little
light
and
not
at
all
hoppy
sort
of
an
americanized
english
beer
with
a
great
deal
of
the
traditional
british
character
taken
out
in
favour
of
north
american
aesthetics
good
not
stellar
its
a
slightly
above
average
brew
and
certainly
better
on
draught
i
wish
there
were
some
more
complexity
for
this
style
mainstream
in
its
own
way
but
also
an
enjoyable
beer
in
the
big
picture
of
beers
available
worth
a
try
this
pale
ale
pours
a
thick
yellow
sort
of
semiclear
with
thick
big
creamy
white
head
of
nitrofoam
has
all
the
characteristic
lacing
of
a
nitrobeer
smell
is
citrus
and
is
it
my
imagination
stoked
by
the
bees
on
the
can
or
is
it
honey
nope
the
taste
is
honey
with
citrus
flowers
and
a
hint
of
butter
its
smooth
very
smooth
with
a
quick
bite
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
but
full
with
the
nitro
a
lot
of
folk
dont
like
the
use
of
nitrogen
in
beer
and
it
does
even
the
flavor
out
a
bit
but
i
do
like
the
creaminess
it
imparts
to
the
brew
i
tried
this
out
of
the
can
light
colored
very
thick
head
but
it
disapates
well
nice
creamy
malty
roasted
flavor
like
the
aftertaste
maybe
even
a
dry
flavor
very
smooth
on
the
carbonation
not
my
favorite
but
a
good
casual
beer
that
would
go
well
with
food
or
without
this
is
one
of
my
old
favorites
apparently
its
a
very
weak
version
if
the
original
but
its
still
tastey
among
the
best
of
nitro
can
beers
fantastically
smooth
creamy
pub
ale
pours
thick
with
a
nice
big
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
this
a
lickfoamoffyourlipandgrin
type
of
beer
smell
has
a
hint
of
honey
and
steel
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
like
melted
ice
cream
tastes
fine
with
hints
of
malt
milk
nuts
the
hops
in
here
are
evident
and
maybe
a
bit
overdone
i
want
my
pub
ales
to
be
creamy
and
smooth
not
really
hoppy
at
all
i
can
take
this
or
leave
it
from
the
can
but
i
hear
its
better
on
draft
pours
a
clear
yellow
thick
big
creamy
white
head
forms
laces
well
and
sticks
around
smell
is
honey
vanilla
citrus
and
dirty
socks
taste
is
honey
and
vanilla
little
bit
of
citrus
and
floral
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
not
too
bad
better
fresh
poured
ontap
at
brits
pub
in
pasadena
ca
a
pub
owned
by
a
liverpudlian
expat
this
beer
poured
beautifully
with
a
nice
thick
head
and
decent
lacing
the
color
was
mainly
yellow
and
there
was
mild
carbonation
the
smell
was
much
like
an
american
macrolager
with
a
bit
more
malt
somewhat
of
chemicals
the
taste
was
not
as
good
as
some
other
bitters
ive
had
but
it
wasnt
awful
either
not
too
complex
it
had
a
very
clean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
but
the
aftertaste
ruined
it
for
me
i
used
to
enjoy
this
beer
greatly
now
i
find
it
a
nice
beer
once
in
a
while
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
but
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
nitrobeer
i
think
this
may
be
the
first
one
ive
ever
reviewed
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
bodacious
foamy
head
the
white
foam
across
the
top
almost
has
the
consistency
of
pudding
the
smell
is
pretty
faint
and
boring
the
taste
is
decent
sweet
malts
and
a
fruity
hop
taste
here
and
there
i
just
dislike
the
mouthfeel
on
these
nitros
too
thin
and
watery
always
seems
to
remind
me
of
an
old
beer
that
was
opened
put
back
in
the
fridge
and
then
resorted
to
several
days
later
not
a
bad
beer
otherwise
id
like
to
try
it
ontap
or
atleast
in
a
different
serving
type
the
taste
is
not
much
to
write
home
about
however
the
taste
was
ok
and
very
buttery
with
smooth
malts
and
hints
of
sweetness
but
nothing
really
notable
it
was
quite
a
bland
mix
but
something
you
must
buy
if
only
to
admire
the
beauty
of
these
nitro
heads
not
something
that
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
or
ever
again
just
not
my
glass
of
beer
i
guess
i
have
known
bodingtons
for
over
a
year
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
am
reviewing
it
i
love
the
initial
pour
of
the
beer
as
it
settles
the
color
and
the
sight
of
the
beer
setteling
is
a
sight
to
behold
as
well
as
the
creamy
head
it
leaves
behind
i
really
enjoy
the
fact
that
the
head
stays
throughout
the
entire
beer
even
at
the
very
end
there
is
still
a
head
in
which
to
enjoy
the
beer
although
the
smell
is
a
bit
wheaty
and
i
find
that
there
is
not
too
much
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
very
good
coupled
with
the
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
pure
pleasure
to
the
tastebuds
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
usually
like
to
eat
something
along
with
it
eg
a
meal
chips
or
penuts
otherwise
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
a
bad
aftertaste
develops
and
needs
to
be
neutralized
with
a
different
taste
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
to
try
something
new
the
flavor
was
as
the
can
proclaims
smooth
and
creamy
it
could
have
been
fuller
however
it
was
quite
complex
started
bitter
became
a
bit
sweet
and
then
finished
bitter
luckily
i
got
a
single
of
this
at
a
dollar
rack
somewhere
very
glad
i
never
shelled
out
the
89
for
a
4
pack
of
pints
this
is
one
that
i
have
been
drinking
for
years
and
continually
pick
up
when
i
find
a
place
that
sells
the
four
pack
of
pint
cans
even
better
when
you
can
find
it
on
tap
fortunately
this
one
is
available
all
over
the
place
on
tap
the
appearance
of
this
one
is
so
unique
and
awesome
it
fizzes
off
3
shaded
with
dark
yellow
pale
yellow
and
the
most
enduring
white
head
youve
ever
seen
cant
be
beat
banana
in
the
nose
and
the
flavor
with
english
bitterness
i
get
a
glass
of
this
one
90
of
the
time
i
find
it
overall
impression
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
just
screams
session
im
going
to
have
to
pick
some
up
just
for
football
games
flavor
is
unique
and
mild
looks
just
outstanding
about
the
only
dings
are
aroma
and
the
mouthfeel
gets
a
bit
flat
toward
end
but
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
obvious
why
its
lasted
since
1778
theyll
be
drinking
this
in
2078
and
beyond
classic
beer
the
appearance
is
a
caramelhoney
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
very
slight
with
an
almost
sweet
odor
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
nasty
almost
chemicallike
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
this
beer
is
not
all
that
great
of
a
drinker
imo
this
is
quite
possibly
the
only
beer
that
ill
give
rave
reviews
about
because
of
mouthfeel
and
apperance
instead
of
taste
smell
everyone
should
try
boddingtons
at
least
a
few
times
in
their
life
its
a
treat
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
something
less
i
think
ill
go
grab
another
d
this
is
my
kind
of
light
beer
this
one
deserves
respect
the
caramel
sweetness
and
bitterness
balance
nicely
and
invite

this
is
a
very
nice
and
smooth
pub
ale
that
goes
down
wonderfuly
after
a
long
day
at
work
it
pours
into
a
glass
somewhat
resembling
a
pint
of
caffereys
or
kilkenny
but
slightly
lighter
in
color
certainly
nice
to
look
at
smell
is
nothing
special
but
it
does
taste
quite
good
slightly
bitter
with
a
delicate
caramelesque
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
interesting
the
foam
is
very
thick
and
creamy
and
that
makes
for
an
interesting
feeling
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
very
very
drinkable
nothing
offensive
in
this
beer
at
all
and
i
would
definitely
reccomend
this
one
if
im
at
bar
with
only
macro
stuff
or
lame
micro
options
sometimes
ill
get
this
on
nitro
tap
which
is
better
than
the
can
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
do
not
mind
drinking
on
nitro
tap
cold
ive
always
wanted
to
try
this
beer
since
i
see
it
at
my
local
meijer
grocery
store
as
well
as
the
high
class
liqour
store
i
got
to
the
head
was
awesome
to
put
it
in
very
uneloquent
terms
but
the
flavor
did
not
back
up
the
apperance
of
the
beer
the
smell
reminded
me
of
cream
soda
but
the
flavor
of
the
beer
didnt
back
up
the
smell
the
beer
tasted
as
if
it
were
flat
but
the
head
proved
otherwise
my
rocomendation
do
not
try
this
beer
unless
you
like
flat
tasting
beer
what
a
bizarre
beer
pours
a
ridiculously
thick
head
which
when
viewed
from
directly
above
looks
like
milk
a
thick
orange
beer
with
loads
of
carbonation
evident
its
pretty
frightening
to
look
at
to
tell
the
truth
smell
isnt
half
badjust
relatively
simple
there
is
a
perfumey
apple
juice
smell
laden
with
pungent
notes
of
other
fruits
banana
and
pear
i
think
the
taste
is
bland
and
safe
but
not
badthe
same
fruity
smells
surface
on
the
palate
but
there
is
an
awful
pang
of
plastic
midway
through
that
is
really
pretty
disgusting
fortunately
the
plastic
pang
is
shortlived
tis
very
thick
to
drink
and
the
carbonation
that
i
was
expecting
given
the
head
and
bubbles
somehow
hardly
exists
at
all
while
this
is
no
favorite
of
mine
i
can
see
myself
pulling
one
out
of
the
fridge
once
in
a
blue
moon
just
for
the
campfactor
compared
to
normal
bottled
pale
ales
this
is
very
drinkable
theres
not
a
lot
of
new
flavors
to
consider
but
its
a
pleasure
to
pour
admire
and
consume
this
couldnt
be
the
focus
of
a
beer
drinking
session
but
as
something
to
drink
casually
while
chatting
with
friends
in
the
pub
its
ideal
one
can
criticism
the
nitro
system
but
it
sure
produces
a
good
looking
beer
clear
copper
under
a
one
finger
white
head
of
very
thick
cream
that
lasts
forever
oddly
the
lacing
is
a
bit
thin
there
is
remarkably
little
nose
basically
none
the
mouth
is
heavy
and
sticky
with
mild
carbonation
the
taste
is
neither
grainy
nor
sweet
with
tinny
hops
emerging
quite
early
accompanied
by
a
touch
of
grassiness
the
finish
is
more
metallic
than
bitter
whith
shisps
of
sweetness
grape
mixed
in
nice
lipsmacking
aftertaste
invites
another
swig
it
will
do
very
drinkable
smooth
refreshing
should
go
well
with
just
about
any
kind
of
food
or
just
by
itself
the
taste
is
very
mild
and
well
balanced
nothing
jumps
out
from
this
beer
as
a
dominating
flavor
a
standard
amber
ale
the
creamy
head
and
malty
body
give
this
beer
a
good
mouth
feel
for
those
who
enjoy
a
beer
with
body
the
thickness
of
the
beer
does
limit
its
drinkability
to
one
or
two
in
a
night
cheers
appearance
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
great
foam
and
lacing
aroma
is
crisp
with
sweet
flowers
and
banana
initial
taste
is
a
smoot
experience
that
is
like
a
good
latte
medium
body
and
a
sweet
roasted
coffee
malt
flavor
predominates
and
overcome
the
flowery
yet
bitter
hops
adry
finish
that
ends
in
astringent
tannins
and
barley
so
so
unfortunately
like
newcastle
brown
ale
it
suffers
from
a
watery
sodalike
flavor
and
body
lightened
presumably
for
massmarket
consumption
the
creamy
character
is
somewhat
special
but
it
needs
more
of
everything
to
become
a
real
ale
like
the
look
of
this
can
it
is
black
and
yellow
with
a
simple
brewing
barrel
as
the
label
i
just
love
the
name
as
well
it
it
oozes
english
beer
tradition
this
one
pours
from
a
can
at
44ml

overall
taste
quality
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
taste
is
well
rounded
on
the
palate
and
the
taste
is
well
balanced
there
is
a
subtle
hint
of
honey
which
works
exceedingly
well
if
i
could
afford
to
drink
this
beer
in
vast
quantities
i
would
i
suspect
the
more
of
this
beer
i
drink
the
more
i
would
love
it
edit
1121
only
six
months
later
and
this
one
is
not
nearly
what
i
once
thought
it
was
the
nitro
leaves
a
nice
impression
but
the
beer
is
at
best
unimpressive
very
watery
body
and
no
outstanding
flavors
not
poor
but
not
good
update
ever
since
the
closing
of
strangeways
this
beer
has
lost
what
made
it
great
still
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
special
among
similars
now
that
ive
had
this
ale
a
few
times
from
the
can
not
much
of
a
rating
difference
ive
had
a
chance
to
whiff
the
aroma
and
upped
the
rating
a
half
point
but
everything
else
is
still
the
same
compared
to
the
ontap
review
i
did
this
ale
is
very
good
beyond
drinkable
in
my
opinion
at
this
time
i
would
not
reccomend
it
from
the
nitro
can
unless
you
just
like
watching
reverse
cascades
a
really
nice
brew
poured
out
to
a
clear
medium
dark
golden
color
with
a
respectable
head
medium
carbonation
traces
of
lace
were
slightly
present
aroma
of
hops
and
sweetness
taste
was
suprisingly
smooth
and
inviting
flavors
of
hops
and
grain
were
present
as
was
a
buttery
smooth
mouthfeel
that
really
got
my
attention
finished
crisp
and
quite
refreshing
this
could
be
a
session
beer
in
fact
on
more
than
one
occasion
for
me
and
my
buddies
it
has
been
recommended
goes
down
smooth
as
silk
making
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
a
very
drinkable
lighter
beer
to
give
yourself
a
break
in
a
long
session
the
beer
looked
great
the
formation
and
retention
of
the
head
was
nice
to
look
at
unfortunately
the
liquid
was
seriously
devoid
of
any
recognizable
flavor
no
hops
no
malt
not
even
a
bad
flavor
just
veryvery
bland
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
nitro
cans
these
were
a
freebie
from
a
friend
so
i
am
not
out
anything
i
am
going
to
try
the
other
two
16oz
cans
later
if
the
taste
changes
i
will
revise
my
review
if
not
i
will
just
look
forward
to
trying
something
new
pours
a
bright
deep
golden
hue
with
a
creamy
stark
white
halfinch
head
that
has
some
staying
power
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
honey
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
whiff
of
something
slightly
sour
that
suggests
the
use
of
a
bit
of
adjunct
malt
palate
is
well
balanced
between
sweet
malt
and
mild
english
hops
with
a
subtle
honey
background
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
beautifully
creamy
mouthfeel
as
a
result
of
the
nitro
cartridge
in
the
can
a
great
session
beer
whether
in
the
can
or
on
draught
well
its
not
fantastically
remarkable
but
it
does
have
two
worthwhile
qualities
for
one
it
doesnt
really
have
too
much
of
that
nitrofunk
that
you
get
with
most
beers
that
come
in
nitrocans
but
you
still
get
that
great
creamy
headretention
thanks
to
the
nitrocan
secondly
its
really
drinkable
would
make
a
great
session
beer
so
its
worth
a
try
this
is
like
a
can
full
of
nitrogen
and
chemcials
barely
even
resembles
a
beer
i
hear
this
stuff
used
to
be
really
good
too
what
a
shame
i
dont
think
i
like
the
mouthfeel
too
much
but
i
does
go
good
with
the
beer
on
draft
i
say
its
good
when
i
get
in
in
cans
ill
rerate
it
pours
a
light
clear
amber
color
with
a
beautiful
head
the
head
is
creamy
and
looks
like
whipped
egg
whites
nice
and
fluffy
id
comment
on
the
aroma
but
it
is
practically
nonexistant
maybe
a
faint
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
very
light
and
smooth
mild
maltiness
with
hardly
any
hop
bitterness
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
creamy
but
the
carbonation
seems
light
i
think
it
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
although
it
really
isnt
very
complex
and
is
kind
of
bland
it
isnt
a
beer
you
would
want
to
drink
if
youve
just
had
a
beer
with
explosive
flavor
pouring
from
the
nitro
can
causes
a
beautiful
creamy
head
on
top
this
clear
amber
liquid
foam
lasts
the
whole
glass
and
with
a
deep
swallow
leaves
a
mustache
of
creamy
bubbles
not
a
lot
of
aroma
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
but
any
smell
tends
to
get
killed
by
the
nitro
no
strong
flavors
good
or
bad
pretty
average
taste
all
around
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
goes
down
smooth
taste
its
there
lightly
fruity
touch
of
hops
a
touch
sour
but
altogether
smooth
slim
body
neglible
finish
this
ale
quits
the
mouth
with
a
quickness
i
understand
the
appeal
of
pub
ales
but
it
just
doesnt
apply
in
my
case
generally
i
like
ales
with
bigger
flavor
than
this
but
you
cant
knock
its
popularity
and
it
delivers
to
those
who
subscribe
not
for
me
though
ontap
at
fiddlers
green
in
orlando
awesome
perfect
cascading
in
a
clear
amber
yellow
with
a
tan
head
that
laced
the
pint
glass
all
the
way
down
lite
aromas
of
malt
and
citrus
that
matched
the
creamy
smooth
taste
a
lemon
was
in
the
background
thin
of
course
cream
ale
that
you
could
drink
all
night
easily
nice
lite
hoppy
finish
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
its
good
for
when
you
want
something
light
to
quench
your
thirst
the
best
thing
about
it
by
far
is
its
appearance
while
i
wouldnt
say
its
wellrounded
its
certainly
pleasant
enough
for
me
it
just
doesnt
declare
itself
enough
looks
great
but
has
really
no
taste
to
it
overall
a
decent
brew
i
would
recommend
this
possibly
as
a
crossover
beer
pours
with
that
wonderful
waterfall
effect
a
la
guinness
a
2
tall
creamyfluffy
almost
edible
offwhite
head
forms
the
brew
is
a
nice
golden
color
smell
is
light
with
hops
amlt
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
spice
taste
is
hops
a
little
spice
and
some
malt
not
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
here
a
smooth
drinking
beer
with
light
effervescence
and
not
much
aftertaste
overall
considering
it
came
from
a
can
a
pretty
good
beer
but
doesnt
hold
up
like
say
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
get
this
on
tap
it
is
much
better
there
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
session
with
the
low
carbonation
and
mild
flavour
overall
the
flavour
and
aroma
feel
a
little
muted
440
ml
can
more
beers
should
be
carbonated
with
nitrogen
it
gives
the
beer
such
a
fullbodied
satisfying
feel
it
poured
with
a
thick
thick
creamy
head
and
on
top
there
is
a
darker
thicker
head
on
top
of
an
offhead
that
disappears
as
the
beer
settles
the
aroma
does
not
stand
out
as
anything
original
or
complicated
just
simple
hops
and
sweet
maltsbut
strangely
pleasing
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
for
an
ale
but
if
served
cold
enough
is
nicely
crisp
and
satisfying
this
is
a
favorite
beer
of
mine
and
i
find
it
incredibly
drinkable
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
consistent
offwhite
creamy
nitrogenated
head
white
bready
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
clover
honey
and
faint
hopping
predominant
taste
is
ironladen
manchester
water
with
a
light
toasty
malt
profile
diacetyl
and
a
faint
hop
bitterness
im
not
really
sure
why
people
swear
by
this
beer
it
must
be
a
process
of
socialization
just
as
bland
and
unsatisfying
as
it
is
on
nitrodraught
except
with
a
further
metallic
minerally
taste
creamy
mouthfeel
but
thats
nothing
new
with
a
nitro
can
thats
about
all
it
has
going
for
it
ive
been
told
from
one
englishman
its
the
best
thing
to
come
from
manchester
obviously
that
bloke
doesnt
care
for
football
the
stone
roses
oasis
happy
mondays
new
order
the
smiths
or
the
charlatans
uk
im
wondering
whether
he
was
faking
an
accent
nah
just
pride
gotta
defend
the
hometown
the
draught
can
leaves
you
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
is
an
amber
color
with
a
good
amount
of
bubbles
visible
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
sweet
with
strong
suggestions
of
caramel
hops
are
not
very
aromatic
and
seem
to
be
hard
to
detect
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
caramel
coming
through
here
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
drinkablility
is
great
would
make
a
nice
session
since
production
was
taken
over
by
inbevinterbrewwhatever
they
call
themselves
now
and
has
been
moved
to
luton
i
no
longer
find
boddingtons
as
enjoyable
the
cream
has
been
robbed
from
manchester
and
has
suffered
greatly
luton
brewed
boddingtons
has
lost
its
creaminess
and
now
has
a
harsh
aluminum
can
edge
to
it
formerly
drinkable
this
is
now
just
unbearable
my
review
however
is
based
upon
manchester
brewed
boddingtons
and
shall
thus
not
be
altered
comments
although
not
particularly
exciting
this
beer
would
probably
be
a
good
session
beer
call
me
crazy
but
there
is
something
refreshing
about
occasionally
drinking
a
beer
that
is
simple
and
smooth
without
an
american
adjunct
flavor
to
it
a
good
clean
bright
yellow
beer
has
a
big
spoonable
creamy
white
head
and
leaves
lace
effect
there
was
a
light
sweet
grassy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
lemon
to
it
the
flavor
was
light
and
had
a
little
sweetness
with
that
same
hint
of
lemon
just
before
the
quick
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
boddingtons
i
just
dont
get
it
pours
a
nice
light
amber
with
a
frothy
white
nitro
head
it
smells
really
sweet
like
caramel
the
flavor
is
equally
sweet
with
a
very
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
that
is
not
too
pleasant
but
is
by
no
means
repulsive
the
body
is
very
thin
and
watery
overall
not
the
best
epa
but
definitely
not
the
worst
drinkability
is
ok
not
something
i
would
buy
normally
but
the
boss
at
work
mentioned
he
enjoyed
it
and
i
hadnt
tried
it
so
here
we
are
would
by
in
a
restaurant
or
pub
with
limited
options
but
not
something
to
keep
around
i
cant
believe
that
i
have
not
reviewed
this
beer
yet
it
poured
from
the
can
a
slightly
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
thick
creamy
head
the
nose
was
slightly
creamy
caramely
with
some
fruity
esters
as
well
the
flavor
had
good
caramel
sweetness
and
a
creamy
flavor
with
some
strawberrylike
fruity
esters
finishing
slightly
hoppy
the
feel
was
velvety
smooth
creamy
and
thick
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
i
find
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
its
a
nice
beer
to
fall
back
on
this
is
my
first
nitrocan
expirience
boddingtons
pub
ale
is
light
copper
in
color
with
a
supercreamy
nitro
induced
head
the
head
never
disappates
and
leaves
thick
lacings
around
the
inside
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
very
light
smell
is
fairly
similar
to
american
macros
just
a
little
more
clean
the
taste
is
very
bland
no
real
malt
or
hop
character
also
this
is
a
little
too
dry
especially
since
there
isnt
enough
flavor
to
go
around
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
which
adds
some
drinkability
this
isnt
something
ill
pick
up
again
and
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
nitro
can
great
head
perfectly
milky
and
dense
like
snow
lasting
on
a
pale
yellow
color
body
the
smell
is
quite
pleasing
although
i
have
a
bit
of
a
cold
and
cant
really
describe
it
adequately
still
not
bad
quite
fruity
and
sweet
the
taste
is
nothing
amazing
but
its
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
the
hoppiness
gets
a
bit
oily
but
it
isnt
annoying
a
bit
dry
in
the
end
the
maltiness
is
round
but
not
very
expressive
maybe
some
wooden
notes
mouthfeel
is
soft
smooth
and
creamy
decent
overall
not
a
bad
beer
no
aroma
yellow
appearance
with
such
foam
not
much
taste
just
a
slight
bitterness
some
creaminess
probably
owing
to
gas
tap
passable
drink
at
seasonal
party
bit
of
sweetness
and
grassiness
moderately
dry
aftertaste
medium
but
still
watery
mouthfeel
bottom
line
dont
give
up
on
this
beer
if
you
only
try
it
in
the
nitro
cans
the
tap
version
is
like
a
whole
different
beer
and
you
are
likely
to
enjoy
it
much
more
if
you
like
this
style
of
beer
beerookie
below
does
amuch
better
job
of
describing
the
appearnce
of
a
boddingtons
pub
ale
poured
out
of
a
nitro
can
especially
the
effects
of
the
widget
for
the
twofold
foaming
good
carbonation
and
lacing
as
well
no
bitterness
at
all
almost
too
creamy
and
mild
this
makes
it
an
exceptionally
easy
pint
to
drink
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
hoppiness
but
no
problems
overall
here
from
the
can
this
beer
poured
a
golden
honey
color
it
produced
a
about
a
finger
thick
lasting
head
there
was
no
other
evidence
of
carbonation
the
smell
was
good
and
malty
the
taste
had
a
honey
character
it
was
slightly
bitter
from
the
hops
but
not
too
strong
this
ale
was
nice
and
smooth
and
light
in
the
mouth
maybe
a
bit
too
light
a
good
ale
not
the
best
ive
had
but
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
downing
a
few
of
these
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
ourstanding
either
guess
i
should
resample
to
get
the
true
measure
of
it
beautiful
appearance
pale
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
left
my
glass
sheathed
in
a
thick
coating
of
creamy
lace
head
lasted
till
the
last
sip
the
smell
was
very
faint
floral
hops
but
mostly
a
doughy
yeasty
smell
not
bad
at
all
very
mild
taste
no
high
or
low
points
just
no
real
substance
in
any
category
it
was
good
to
try
again
will
keep
some
around
next
summer
as
a
good
quencher
a
champion
beer
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
am
surprised
at
the
low
ratings
for
this
it
has
a
wonderful
appearance
and
i
am
not
a
big
amber
guy
and
a
perfect
head
the
taste
is
toasty
and
comforting
probably
the
best
of
the
more
popular
beers
poured
a
orange
copper
color
with
a
nice
size
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
aroma
malts
caramel
some
fruits
flavor
not
much
of
anything
did
get
hints
of
toffee
and
some
bitterness
a
little
to
light
on
the
mouth
feel
for
me
i
am
just
glad
i
didnt
buy
this
somebody
gave
a
can
of
this
to
try
drinkability
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
categorize
here
people
have
mixed
reviews
on
this
some
love
it
some
hate
it
and
some
are
like
me
i
think
its
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
but
i
really
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
very
often
maybe
above
average
drinkability
due
to
the
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
light
body
i
recommend
people
to
at
least
try
it
and
id
love
to
try
it
ontap
if
i
ever
got
the
opportunity
consumed
in
october
2004
at
the
prince
of
wales
pub
in
san
mateo
ca
spilled
about
an
ounce
of
it
all
over
the
counter
after
i
thought
i
opened
it
slow
enough
pour
was
beautiful
as
most
nitro
cans
do
a
huge
creamy
head
the
slowly
faded
but
still
had
a
bit
left
at
the
end
of
the
glass
didnt
smell
much
maybe
a
bit
like
guinness
some
roasted
malts
not
a
real
strong
scent
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
expected
tastes
of
malt
maybe
a
hop
or
two
and
maybe
a
very
very
slight
fruit
taste
lemon
still
went
down
very
nicely
kind
of
an
odd
taste
a
hard
to
describe
taste
not
bad
but
just
strange
decent
enough
brew
though
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
pours
out
golden
colored
with
a
nice
creamy
head
great
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
goes
down
not
a
huge
aroma
here
at
all
could
barely
detect
anything
very
creamy
mouthfeel
that
coats
the
palate
nicely
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
many
exciting
or
interesting
characteristics
about
it
ng
pours
hazy
amber
with
nice
frothy
head
smells
skunky
with
alcohol
and
malt
tastes
rather
bitter
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
was
smooth
surprisingly
compared
to
the
taste
although
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
much
at
all
i
do
suppose
it
was
a
decent
example
of
the
type
this
seems
to
be
a
very
unique
beer
i
liked
it
but
i
wouldnt
search
it
out
this
beer
has
a
kick
nice
flavor
and
for
what
it
is
it
is
smooth
the
plastic
thingy
inside
is
interesting
similar
to
the
guiness
tap
in
bottle
i
dont
know
if
it
reallt
enhances
the
flavor
a
lot
or
if
it
has
a
psycological
affect
more
than
a
real
effect
but
in
any
event
it
doesent
taste
bad
at
all
the
last
4
times
ive
had
boddingtons
it
was
terrible
ive
lowered
my
scores
accordingly
it
will
be
a
while
before
i
try
again
an
interesting
experience
but
when
i
finished
i
did
not
want
another
try
it
once
for
the
show
ive
had
good
nitro
pub
ales
and
ive
had
bad
nitro
pub
ales
count
boddingtons
pub
ale
as
one
of
the
latter
thumbs
down
smooth
mouthfeel
average
drinkabilty
i
could
have
it
again
but
id
rather
a
beamish
please
it
poured
with
lots
of
bubbles
forming
a
light
gold
cascade
the
finished
in
a
fairly
clear
light
gold
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
was
pretty
well
straight
up
malt
the
taste
was
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
bitter
it
started
out
with
a
blast
of
sweet
creamy
beer
and
finished
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
edge
it
was
medium
and
creamy
a
real
pleasure
in
the
mouth
definately
a
possible
decision
but
not
a
primary
i
tried
this
beer
yesterday
82104
in
some
taste
tournaments
of
the
various
beers
that
were
available
on
tap
at
a
downtown
boston
pub
the
others
we
compared
and
tested
there
were
3
of
us
were
pilsner
urquel
harpoon
ipa
smithwicks
sam
adams
blue
label
sam
adams
summer
ale
and
bass
i
really
thought
this
was
the
worst
beer
of
all
each
other
beer
had
something
going
for
it
except
this
one
my
friends
felt
the
same
way
bitter
and
a
woody
finish
but
woody
in
a
dirty
piece
of
wood
way
nothing
to
like
about
the
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
either
overall
a
very
subpar
english
pale
ale
little
body
and
flavor
make
for
a
flat
boring
uninspiring
beer
skip
this
one
at
all
costs
a
nice
mild
bitter
or
is
this
a
hoppy
mild
either
way
it
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
have
sampled
this
common
brew
on
tap
nitro
as
expected
it
arrived
with
a
huge
super
creamy
head
which
dissolved
into
a
smaller
creamy
head
this
brew
is
all
about
the
mouthfeel
velvet
in
a
glass
malty
nose
sweet
malt
center
notes
of
honey
vanilla
flowers
tasty
stuff
mildly
hoppped
super
pleasant
summer
quaffer
overall
not
bad
but
just
lacking
a
bit
on
flavor
there
are
oodles
of
bitters
that
i
prefer
i
like
it
to
a
small
degree
for
its
visuals
and
availability
at
those
same
places
where
guinness
is
considered
exotic
this
was
a
very
clean
and
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
steak
or
just
with
friends
this
is
one
beautiful
beer
while
yellow
in
color
the
head
is
very
impressive
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistant
however
as
this
beer
proves
to
be
very
mellow
what
the
beer
lacks
malty
and
hoppy
goodness
it
makes
up
in
creaminess
there
is
not
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
beer
goes
down
quickly
and
seems
light
this
is
a
beer
that
is
nice
for
very
occasional
drinking
but
it
certainly
does
have
its
place
in
the
world
of
beer
just
as
everyone
else
had
said
the
nitro
can
is
a
hassle
the
beer
tends
to
go
everywhere
poured
a
goldishreddish
color
with
a
wonderful
cascading
effect
a
white
frothy
head
that
stays
the
same
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
of
a
smell
to
speak
of
honestly
had
a
rather
sweet
taste
to
it
that
becomes
more
prevalent
as
the
glass
warmed
up
not
a
very
strong
taste
a
very
mellow
beer
that
never
had
a
bite
to
it
mouthfeel
was
well
creamy
a
smooth
beer
that
went
down
nicely
however
the
after
taste
was
like
i
was
eating
the
can
every
time
i
finished
a
swallow
thats
all
i
got
could
be
a
very
nice
beer
if
it
werent
for
that
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
a
good
beer
but
probably
not
something
id
keep
my
fridge
stocked
with
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
like
guiness
this
can
easily
be
consumed
in
more
than
mass
quantities
unfortunately
for
5
a
pop
my
pocketbook
tells
me
otherwise
my
local
store
had
4
pint
packs
for
7
dollers
so
i
figured
id
give
this
a
whirl
and
first
off
i
had
to
change
my
shirt
after
opening
it
thank
you
nitro
can
now
pouring
it
into
a
pint
glass
wow
perfect
ale
color
nice
creamy
head
took
a
long
bit
to
settle
and
a
pleasant
yet
slightly
skunky
smell
to
it
however
the
taste
was
anything
but
it
tasted
sort
of
like
an
average
run
of
the
mill
ale
but
the
mouthfeel
was
what
set
this
beer
apart
it
was
quite
creamy
and
in
fact
reminded
me
of
a
ale
form
of
murphys
stout
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
now
excuse
me
i
still
have
half
a
pint
to
finish
with
lunch
the
pour
was
a
clean
headless
bright
straw
with
just
some
bubbles
floating
up
irregularly
served
cold
as
well
the
smell
quite
bitter
as
ive
seen
in
the
english
is
also
a
bit
sour
at
the
nose
the
taste
isnt
all
that
good
but
passes
my
test
it
is
not
abundant
in
its
bitterness
which
i
liked
but
really
is
moderate
in
every
sense
its
an
alright
company
for
the
euro2004
at
the
pub
seriously
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
im
on
the
fence
about
this
one
generally
not
my
ideal
of
something
id
enjoy
but
i
could
see
myself
having
a
craving
for
this
if
i
wanted
something
soft
light
and
insanely
quaffable
golden
with
very
light
carbination
pours
with
that
lovely
guinness
like
nitro
pour
that
you
just
have
to
admire
the
glass
thick
ring
of
head
that
was
about
18
inch
when
it
sat
there
nitro
tap
so
it
comes
out
sooo
nice
and
creamy
and
smooth
tasting
yum
very
balanced
in
flavor
great
bitterness
but
not
overly
done
hoppy
yet
not
too
much
it
is
just
such
a
great
drinking
beer
one
you
know
you
are
safe
with
anywhere
and
anytime
of
the
year
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
are
many
better
ones
out
there
i
just
hate
these
nitro
cans
the
only
beer
that
i
have
tasted
that
is
bettergood
in
the
nitro
can
is
youngs
dc
stout
enough
of
my
rant
i
just
had
to
get
that
off
my
chest
the
pour
is
nice
with
a
golden
hue
and
a
creamy
head
that
settles
about
an
inch
thick
i
seriously
cant
smell
anything
the
creamy
head
is
blocking
my
sniffing
abilities
the
taste
is
also
nothing
the
nitro
can
has
a
way
of
blocking
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
the
creamy
head
is
sticking
to
my
mouth
blocking
all
other
tastes
maybe
a
slight
dextrin
sweet
taste
at
the
back
of
my
mouth
this
beer
also
seems
flat
in
my
mouth
i
dont
get
any
carbonation
when
tasting
it
i
have
no
idea
why
this
is
this
is
essentially
brown
water
everything
about
this
beer
is
soft
no
not
soft
whimpy
utterly
limp
this
is
a
beer
that
cant
be
bothered

so
neither
can
i
i
pass
poured
out
thick
and
hearty
with
that
fat
nitro
head
loods
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
faint
very
light
hops
and
a
somewhat
boring
beer
smell
in
the
mouth
it
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
head
is
frothy
and
it
goes
down
easily
flavor
wise
it
is
weak
not
terribly
so
but
pretty
blah
faint
malt
here
very
light
hops
there
and
all
with
an
oddoff
metallic
taste
not
bad
but
not
good
either
it
is
drinkable
though
if
there
isnt
anything
better
around
nice
deep
darker
yellow
with
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
mildly
sweetmalty
aroma
curbed
by
some
neutral
hops
malty
and
creamy
and
rounded
with
some
noble
hops
starts
with
medium
body
and
finishes
a
bit
fuller
i
enjoy
these
as
an
easy
drinking
beer
primarily
when
there
is
nothing
else
hoppy
available
the
nitro
can
results
in
an
attractive
active
pour
as
there
is
a
nice
cascade
of
bubbles
once
all
the
action
has
died
down
a
very
light
golden
beer
is
left
with
the
standard
sharp
white
collar
of
a
nitro
beer
a
very
mild
grassy
aroma
comes
forth
creamy
mild
taste
with
a
virtually
nonexistent
finish
and
an
almost
absence
of
hops
not
terrible
tasting
but
it
certainly
lacks
most
of
the
flavors
present
in
the
beers
i
really
like
very
smooth
and
creamy
mostly
from
the
nitro
can
and
as
a
result
its
easy
to
drink
one
of
these
overall
rather
unimpressive
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
far
from
spectacular
and
one
im
unlikely
to
try
again
thick
just
like
guinness
it
also
had
just
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonation
just
like
guinness
i
think
of
it
as
a
light
guinness
its
not
quite
as
thick
and
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
it
definitely
had
some
bitterness
to
it
just
so
similar
to
guinness
i
have
nothing
else
to
compare
it
too
hey
its
a
gorgeous
beer
i
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looks
very
drinkable
nevertheless
wow
this
beer
really
looks
like
it
was
poured
from
a
bar
tap
great
body
boddingtons
is
so
unique
for
being
a
lightlooking
golden
beer
that
pours
like
an
irish
stout
those
widget
things
work
well
moving
past
the
appearence
this
is
a
very
mild
tasting
brew
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
but
while
swallowing
it
feels
like
a
beamish
or
murphys
thanks
once
again
to
the
nitrogen
blast
slightly
sweet
this
a
good
smooth
drinking
session
brew
that
pairs
great
with
spicey
food
sampled
123003
what
a
beautiful
pour
golden
orange
on
the
bottom
carbination
bubbling
up
to
the
5
milk
shake
head
i
dont
know
if
it
was
worth
5
but
it
was
fing
good
head
kept
its
thickness
and
presence
for
a
week
and
a
half
thick
rich
full
taste
that
doesnt
overstay
its
welcome
weak
smell
of
hops
and
smooth
creamy
flow
over
the
lips
and
past
the
gums
an
old
favorite
ive
often
heard
of
it
as
guinness
lite
and
white
guinness
this
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
suitable
for
marathon
nights
of
putting
back
the
wet
stuff
or
just
enjoying
with
dinner
not
a
bad
run
of
the
mill
brew
nitro
can

poured
a
golden
brew
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
malts
coming
through
taste
is
very
light
but
similar
to
kilkenney
or
guiness
in
a
nitro
can
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
good
session
beer
probably
wont
try
that
again
since
there
is
a
lot
more
interesting
session
beer
out
there
if
only
it
tasted
and
smelled
as
good
as
it
looks
or
even
as
good
as
it
feels
in
the
mouth
it
would
be
more
wellrounded
as
it
is
its
all
over
the
board
with
the
assets
lessened
by
the
almostliabilities
i
enjoyed
it
overall
but
its
just
so
inconsistent
in
its
various
components
one
has
to
love
that
creamy
mouthfeel
but
it
doesnt
overcome
the
thin
aroma
and
flavor
it
is
indeed
drinkable
because
the
basic
consituents
and
mild
abv
lend
themselves
to
easy
consumption
but
i
just
cant
get
past
the
ups
and
downs
to
justify
drinking
this
over
something
i
know
id
enjoy
more
or
at
least
something
new
i
want
to
try
oh
well
so
it
goes
they
have
some
canoes
in
britain
too
apparently
not
a
particularly
flavorful
brew
but
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
worth
a
try
light
bodied
and
smooth
a
mild
session
beer
seemed
even
lower
in
abv
than
4
7
nothing
too
special
but
a
quality
beer
taste
is
a
bit
thin
but
creamy
a
nice
hoppy
finish
as
it
warms
but
overall
pretty
plain
very
drinkable
and
smooth
but
nothing
special
a
decent
beer
overall
but
that
look
was
just
too
much
to
live
up
to

though
this

is

this
pairing
of
a

adds
to
the

and
makes
it
very
enjoyable
also
surprisingly

you
can
really
pound
these
either
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
during
a
cold
night
at
the
pub
a
great
session
beer
anytime
the
king
recommends
drinking
this
beer
with
a
double
chocolate
fudge
brownie
very
drinkable
if
you
want
some
thing
light
when
i
first
asked
about
this
drink
a
lady
patron
said
its
like
a
beer
milkshake
i
was
highly
confused
with
this
remark
until
i
drank
it
it
really
is
like
a
beer
flavored
milkshake
hard
to
explain
but
definetly
worth
a
shot
after
having
this
on
tap
and
enjoying
it
i
picked
up
a
4pack
of
the
nitro
cans
not
the
same
at
all
tasted
like
a
runofthe
mill
pale
ale
that
was
creamier
stick
to
this
on
tap
this
ale
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
reminds
me
of
a
cafe
frappe
with
milk
that
ive
had
in
greece
there
isnt
too
much
presence
of
anything
in
the
aroma
slight
floral
hop
but
no
malt
the
taste
however
is
an
interesting
mix
of
fruitiness
and
vanilla
with
a
good
balance
of
slight
sweetness
and
bitterness
im
partial
to
the
nitrogenated
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
as
it
makes
the
beer
velvetysmooth
its
a
fairly
average
alcohol
content
that
you
cant
taste
or
feel
yielding
a
very
high
drinkability
drinkability

i
enjoyed
this
one
although
ive
never
had
the
opportunity
to
knock
back
a
few
pale
ales
in
england
proper
maybe
it
doesnt
compare

but
for
the
time
being
and
keeping
this
one
on
my
list
of
buy
again

tastes
weakly
maltyhoppy
with
no
real
character
thin
in
body
and
mouthfeel
low
in
alcohol
guess
it
makes
for
something
you
can
drink
all
night
with
your
friends
drinkability
is
very
good
but
why
would
you
want
to
i
found
no
qualities
in
this
beer
that
arent
better
executed
elsewhere
my
favorite
ale
served
from
a
can
this
beer
poured
an
extremely
thick
creamy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
color
was
a
lightish
yellow
smelled
rich
and
creamy
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
experienced
such
a
sweet
dairylike
smell
could
have
sworn
there
was
milk
in
it
tasted
incredibly
sweet
and
creamy
but
felt
a
little
harsh
in
the
mouth
for
some
reason
however
this
harshness
was
countered
by
the
incredible
taste
easy
to
drink
since
the
flavor
was
so
incredible
i
didnt
take
points
off
for
appearance
even
though
i
was
tempted
to
when
the
contents
of
my
can
proceded
to
explode
all
over
me
upon
opening
it
and
the
same
thing
happened
to
my
brother
as
well
seeing
as
how
these
werent
even
shook
up
i
would
advise
opening
these
in
the
sink
as
for
the
beer
it
is
quite
average
in
all
respects
and
it
doesnt
pull
any
punches
tetleys
is
in
a
similar
vein
to
this
beer
but
i
found
that
one
to
be
a
bit
more
enjoyable
than
this
can
opens
extremely
violently
every
one
opens
with
beer
spraying
pours
with
a
huge
thick
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
and
leaves
residue
on
your
upper
lip
i
have
heard
that
the
us
version
cant
compare
to
the
uk
version
which
i
hope
is
right
the
head
is
delcious
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
very
interesting
malt
and
cereal
grains
with
nothing
that
special
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
light
and
the
carbonation
is
nonexistant
its
not
so
great
however
its
light
and
inoffensive
so
its
fairly
drinkable
a
fairly
boring
brew
here
it
has
the
standard
nitro
tap
look
awesome
cascading
effect
which
leaves
a
nice
creamy
head
on
top
of
a
creamy
golden
body
the
head
of
course
lasts
and
lasts
throughout
the
brew
in
terms
of
smell
an
taste
i
was
hard
pressed
to
come
up
with
something
definitive
there
was
a
bit
of
floral
sweetness
in
the
smell
less
so
in
the
taste
which
was
watery
overall
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
certainly
not
as
watery
as
a
macro
this
is
a
very
smooth
very
creamy
brew
thats
easy
to
drink
and
even
though
its
a
different
choice
while
being
fairly
easy
to
find
on
tap
id
prefer
another
commonly
tapped
brew
such
as
a
sam
adams
or
snpa
just
about
any
time
over
this
one
nice
to
look
at
i
guess
pours
a
very
seethrough
gold
color
with
the
nitrohead
smooth
mouthfeel
due
to
the
nitro
and
no
real
carbonation
which
works
for
guiness
because
of
the
richness
of
the
brew
but
here
just
points
out
the
places
where
this
one
truly
lacks
slightly
sweet
flavor
very
little
hops
in
the
nose
or
on
the
palate
the
afterfeel
in
the
mouth
is
slightly
chalky
like
drinking
dust
tastes
like
a
flat
bad
nearmacro
not
impressed
i
had
a
bad
pint
of
this
at
the
goose
in
brixton
the
lines
were
obviously
not
cared
for
at
that
establishment
and
you
can
tell
as
this
murky
beer
with
no
head
arrived
the
aroma
was
sour
and
bad
as
was
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
still
creamy
but
that
did
not
save
the
drinkability
at
all
on
this
one
its
a
shame
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
readily
available
english
ales
available
over
here
because
there
are
just
so
many
better
but
then
a
suppose
for
the
beer
drinking
appreciation
levels
of
most
aussies
im
almost
certain
theyd
think
this
was
one
of
the
most
tasty
and
complex
beers
theyd
ever
tried
i
suppose
in
the
end
it
shows
how
good
english
brewers
are
even
their
dud
beers
are
drinkable
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
its
traditional
very
dense
and
creamy
white
head
a
lot
of
lace
solid
in
places
not
much
of
a
nose
a
mild
malt
at
best
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
really
not
much
aftertaste
which
i
seek
in
my
beer
some
hops
but
not
flavourful
enough
for
me
its
ok
if
you
bought
it
as
your
round
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
interbrew
calls
this
a
session
beer
which
should
explain
it
in
a

well
this

replacement
for

curse
you
to

still
this
swill
can
be
slammed
home
with
ease
stick
with
guinness
you
at
least
give
off
the
appearance
of
looking
manly
i
guess
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
example
of
an
english
session
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
rock
my
american
palate
the
widgettype
bubbler
gave
a
good
tall
cascading
head
and
this
from
a
can
that
sat
in
my
fridge
for
two
years
that
stayed
with
the
beer
and
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
sides
could
not
detect
much
aroma
which
is
better
than
smelling
skunky
i
guess
english
pub
style
watery
mouthfeel
was
uninspiring
and
i
couldnt
pick
up
much
taste
just
a
little
residual
sweetness
nothing
lingers
much
after
the
swallow
nothing
terrible
just
not
great
call
me
silly
but
ive
always
liked
this
beer
especially
from
the
tap
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
color
the
head
large
creamy
bright
white
and
the
lace
a
fine
sealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
fresh
and
clean
mostly
malt
and
somewhat
sweet
just
like
the
start
top
skinny
in
feel
finish
is
lightly
hopped
dry
and
a
fine
session
beer
in
my
humble
opinion
in
my
effort
to
learn
about
english
beer
i
decided
to
try
boddingtons
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
cascading
and
ending
in
a
thick
white
head
that
has
staying
power
the
hop
and
malt
smells
are
present
but
they
are
very
slight
this
beer
is
classic
to
the
style
being
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
light
and
having
a
creamy
mouthfeel
it
could
be
considered
mellow
and
maybe
even
a
little
watery
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
a
beer
that
you
would
have
to
start
with
it
would
not
be
good
to
have
after
a
in
your
face
beer
because
it
would
be
hard
to
appreciate
its
subtle
tastes
still
if
you
offer
me
one
i
will
not
turn
it
down
after
the
initial
excitement
its
a
mellow
ale
best
suited
for
a
mellow
drinking
session
this
poured
a
rich
golden
color
with
spiraling
lines
of
carbonation
bubbles
going
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
head
retains
at
about
14
inch
for
the
entire
length
and
displayed
a
cascading
effect
while
it
was
settling
the
smell
had
some
hoppiness
but
mostly
a
light
meadlike
crispness
to
it
with
lemony
citrus
and
grass
taste
was
nice
and
smooth
very
light
with
a
hoppy
crispness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
also
smooth
very
creamy
from
the
nitro
i
was
satisfied
at
the
end
definitely
a
smooth
drinkin
ale
that
you
can
down
two
at
a
time
simple
yet
effective
i
wish
this
was
available
without
the
nitro
i
think
it
hurts
the
flavor
with
that
deadening
nitro
pour
bought
this
can
for
a
buck
not
bad
a
deal
for
a
not
bad
a
brew
poured
a
frothy
head
upon
an
amber
pond
surely
the
nitro
widget
now
banging
around
in
the
empty
can
effected
the
appearance
immensely
too
bad
it
doesnt
improve
taste
and
smell
this
was
a
very
metallic
brew
is
their
no
protective
lining
in
the
can
or
is
this
intentional
some
floral
hops
and
odd
smelling
malt
comes
through
the
steel
factory
aroma
taste
hmm
not
bad
if
i
was
the
tinman
again
very
metallic
taste
but
its
cold
after
a
while
to
warm
some
bitterness
comes
through
so
as
not
too
disappoint
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
like
an
irish
creme
though
the
taste
is
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
good
allowing
for
a
drinkable
brew
had
this
at
the
local
pub
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
surprisingly
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
loved
the
head
on
this
one
the
aroma
is
a
little
breadlike
but
theres
really
not
much
aroma
here
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
a
little
malty
there
is
a
little
sweetness
and
a
little
hops
to
keep
things
fun
but
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
amazing
it
is
a
little
bitter
but
just
a
little
great
beer
while
not
overwhelming
in
the
taste
department
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
a
weird
looking
beer
and
nitro
cans
should
be
reserved
for
stouts
was
my
opinion
after
drinking
it
first
off
the
beer
shot
out
of
the
can
apon
breaking
the
cans
seal
so
make
sure
you
have
a
glass
within
a
seconds
reaching
after
cracking
the
seal
back
to
why
pale
beers
shouldnt
be
nitrogen
induced
was
the
appearance
it
looked
like
really
weird
whipped
egg
whites
on
top
of
a
flat
looking
yellowish
beer
smells
like
bread
dough
not
bad
but
not
good
either
tasted
decent
but
would
do
much
better
if
it
actually
had
some
body
to
it
with
no
carbonation
it
just
tasted
like
flat
beer
with
almost
no
flavor
and
became
a
task
to
finish
this
beer
would
be
much
better
having
been
bottle
conditioned
force
carbonated
in
the
bottle
or
have
been
served
from
a
tap
that
is
nonnitrogen

of
my
favourite

can
brews
from
the
u
k
the
appearance
is
a
bit
weak
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
is
thin
the
quality
of
the
brew
however
is
quite
different
i
really
enjoy
the
head
off
of
a
fresh
poured
boddingtons
i
small
glass
of
boddingtons
foam
would
be
great
the
smell
is
quite
mild
mannered
but
pleasant
a
wee
bit
yeasty
or
bready
the
taste
itself
is
quite
mild
too
it
isnt
near
thirst
quenching
like
some
brews
ive
had
but
it
is
still
quite
good
indeed
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel

surprised
that
this
was
a
disappointment
just
a
lousy
finish
very
good
english
beer
shits
great
smell
is
just
slight
toffee
very
clean
mild
malt
profile
that
turns
slightl
fruity
as
the
beer
warms
low
carb
is
good
for
this
beer
aroma
of
caramel
floral
malts
faint
honey
citrus
taste
sweet

caramel
biscuits
subtle
spice
leather
earthy
really
not
bad
for
beer
on
a
plane
decent
malt
bill
very
minimal
hop
presence
aroma
of
sweet
adjuncts
really
enjoyable
with
my
airline
food
good
beer
not
great
tasted
good
after
a
10
km
run
enjoy
o
this
doesnt
try
to
do
anything
spectacular
and
that
is
its
strength
a
fine
malty
brew
that
you
can
drink
down
without
thinking
too
hard
o
great
aroma
god
flavor
profile
but
not
the
most
satisfying
drinker
again
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
in
the
pub
for
the
real
experience
this
expired
a
long
time
ago
this
beer
has
an
o
k
malty
flavor
and
a
hint
that
hops
were
involved
in
its
making
but
overall
seems
just
a
small
step
up
from
a
mass
market
us
beer
i
made
a
few
trips
to
the
uk
many
years
ago
and
had
some
great
local
beers
in
and
around
london
this
is
not
those
overall
london
pride
is
a
solid
pale
ale
with
lots
of
flavour
and
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
good
session
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
good
introduction
to
english
cough
london
beers
overall
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
again
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
good
ambassador
for
the
british
style
which
tends
to
be
more
rounded
and
balanced
than
the
new
wave
of
hop
forward
beers
not
that
im
claiming
one
is
better
than
the
other
just
pointing
out
the
difference
in
the
regional
styling
i
had
a
high
expectation
about
this
beer
at
the
start
i
found
a
bit
of
disappointment
as
with
this
i
realized
that
i
am
more
into
darker
beers
but
after
a
couple
of
drinks
and
a
little
better
temperature
i
started
to
juge
this
as
a
more
neutral
point
and
i
really
found
it
amazing
maybe
not
my
favourite
beer
but
absolutely
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
so
far
a
smooth
flavor
not
so
bitter
to
be
heavy
but
bitter
enough
to
taste
marvelous
magic
this
beer
is
consistently
satisfying
i
grab
a
bottle
or
two
every
few
months
to
remind
myself
of
the
standard
for
quality
beer
smooth
balanced
and
everything
an
english
ale
should
be
a
very
good
english
ale
overall
a
classic
that
never
disappoints
i
could
drink
this
everyday
if
my
budget
allowed
it
very
good
beer
m
light
and
thin
and
fairly
well
carbonated
the
finish
is
fairly
lively
considering
the
fullers
london
pride
is
a
light
orangeamber
pale
ale
it
has
a
small
but
firm
head
and
leaves
a
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
is
a
fruity
citrus
malt
some
bitter
aftertaste
but
overall
very
smooth
close
to
excellent
this
was
the
best
bear
i
had
in
england
this
trip
would
have
again
good
beer
to
try
great
inoffensive
beer
for
people
trying
to
get
into
better
beer
4
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
can
easily
toss
back
yet
still
find
some
good
flavor
in
pours
a
deep
golden
color
very
nice
lacing
much
more
pronounced
than
the
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
malty
and
some
bread
tatse
is
sweet
malts
balanced
well
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
might
be
a
liitle
too
complex
for
me
as
a
new
rater
to
give
a
more
detailed
opinion
overall
well
balanced
beer
o
a
good
beer
with
some
drawbacks
not
as
good
as
fullers
esb
more
malt
would
improve
the
beer
substantially
overall
a
flavorful
balanced
and
refreshing
ale
with
a
pleasant
taste
mouthfeel
medium
light
to
medium
in
body
medium
high
in
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
of
note
because
its
helping
to
keep
many
of
the
hop
flavors
on
my
tongue
for
an
extended
period
of
time
its
really
quite
refreshing
the
malts
add
a
hint
of
coarseness
at
the
back
of
my
throat
but
they
are
working
well
within
the
beer
well
that
was
tasty
you
guys
know
the
drill
with
fullers
but
if
a
selection
of
british
ales
was
put
in
front
of
me
the
only
hesitation
i
would
have
in
going
for
london
pride
first
would
be
its
cousin
esb
surprised
by
this
one
really
nice
balance
a
can
doesnt
do
it
justice
very
creamy
but
lacks
character
glimpses
of
grainy
bitterness
and
nuts
well
balanced
but
just
a
bit
sweet
probably
not
the
freshest
but
such
is
the
case
with
imports
that
likely
sit
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
o
a
nicely
malty
ale
that
is
better
drunk
at
a
bit
above
cellar
temps
very
well
balanced
a
great
ale
for
spring
through
summer
the
hoppiness
of
this
ale
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
still
there
is
a
reason
this
was
once
the
exclusive
beer
for
british
airways
indeed
london
pride
is
a
name
fully
warranted
for
use
by
fuller
this
is
a
brewery
that
should
rightfully
derive
satisfaction
in
its
own
achievements
and
whose
beers
are
widely
admired
for
the
qualities
they
possess
and
good
as
this
is
i
think
they
make
even
better
its
a
malty
ale
with
good
flavor
o
drinkable
but
nothing
wowing
im
not
one
to
knock
tradition
but
im
not
sure
this
brew
has
much
to
offer
the
current
state
of
beer
other
than
a
history
lesson
pours
an
orangey
amber
in
color
with
some
off
white
head
that
faded
quickly
into
a
medium
collar
and
some
thin
wisps
fair
legs
and
lacing
aroma
is
toasty
and
bready
with
some
faint
earthy
hops
taste
is
light
caramel
some
earthy
and
floral
hops
and
a
bit
bready
as
well
appreciable
hop
bitterness
lightmedium
body
and
mediumlow

overall
i
enjoyed
this
for
its
balance
and
earthiness
pours
a
pretty
medium
copperamber
in
color
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
some
very
light
lacing
is
seen
but
not
much
at
all
the
aroma
is
of
some
biscuit
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggests
as
it
has
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
the
taste
is
of
a
lightly
buttered
biscuit
with
hints
of
caramel
honey
and
pine
perfect
carbonation
overall
it
was
different
and
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
nice
complexity
of
flavor
and
definitely
one
to
enjoy
again
pours
an
ohsoslightly
clouded
amber
it
initially
has
a
pretty
creamy
light
tan
head
minor
retention
but
some
very
nice
lacing
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
rich
with
notes
of
fruit
and
burnt
sugar
the
taste
is
superb
with
incredible
malt
depth
for
the
light
abv
the
bottle
version
doesnt
do
the
uk
cask
version
justice
but
it
is
still
delicious
it
has
a
nice
weight
to
it
not
too
heavy
but
not
thin
or
watery
either
in
total
an
excellent
pint
of
ale
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
but
still
decent
i
cut
my
teeth
on
this
beer
in
my
early
days
of
exploring
the
world
of
beer
back
in
the
1980s
despite
the
fact
that
i
was
drinking
it
9
months
after
its
expiration
date
it
held
up
beautifully
and
reminds
me
of
how
i
always
remembered
it
to
be
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
overall
it
balances
nicely
this
beer
will
appeal
to
english
ipa
and
brown
ale
lovers
as
it
has
some
components
of
both
but
balances
well
enough
to
pick
out
these
differences
as
a
fan
of
english

be

and
still
produce
a

quality
product
o
decent
but
not
memorable
overall
a
fine
example
of
its
type
london
pride
is
a
long
time
favourite
of
mine
i
like
it
from
the
tap
cask
from
the
can
and
from
the
bottle
and
its
a
beer
that
doesnt
seem
to
suffer
much
from
any
of
these
storage
methods
this
one
really
is
what
it
says
on
the
tin
rich
malty
satisfying
had
on
tap
at
an
alehouse
in
calgary
1600
in
the
south
arrived
in
a
signature
london
pride
pint
glass
always
a
nice
touch
a
nice
honey
golden
to
orange
amber
color
with
around
three
fingers
of
white
head
aroma
a
classic
british
ale
waft
of
pale
malts
woody
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
fresh
orange
and
coriander
spice
the
latter
a
bit
unusual
in
a
british
pale
but
i
swear
thats
what
i
smell
here
must
be
the
integration
of
citrus
and
peppery
esters
body
is
classic
for
the
style
on
the
thin
side
but
not
watery
palate
is
a
subtle
but
rich
complexity
of
soft
bready
malts
savory
spice
floral
citrus
that
mirrors
the
orange
and
lemon
aroma
medicinal
herb
notes
maybe
a
little
diacetyl
butter
and
a
clean
ultrasmooth
bitter
finish
even
the
nonbeer
geek
i
was
with
was
amazed
by
the
smoothness
overall
effect
is
malty
and
bright
vibrant
citrus
notes
rather
than
supersweet
but
make
no
mistake
i
am
not
talking
citrus
as
in
pungent
west
coast
hops
this
is
earthy
woody
fruity
from
ale
yeast
but
smooth
and
bitter
with
only
a
touch
of
caramel
a
sublime
integration
of
classic
english
flavors
that
taste
quite
bright
and
fresh
on
tap
and
with
an
aggressive
yet
english
hopping
regime
that
leads
the
way
but
does
not
overpower
the
malts
rivals
samuel
smith
old
brewery
but
tastes
a
bit
less
rustic
and
dark
and
one
that
could
most
certainly
be
the
benchmark
for
the
style
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
a
coy
complexity
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
into
english

which

i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
amber
with
white
head
that
laced
the
smell
was
primarily
buttering
hops
the
taste
was
a
well
balanced
beer
between
the
hops
and
malt
there
was
a
subtle
sweetness
that
worked
well
with
the
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
a

light

with

usually
find

i
guess
im
not
as
impressed
with
this
ale
as
many
reviewers
before
me
it
poured
with
a
finger
of
foam
and
in
a
great
redbrown
color
and
with
a
sweet
malty
smell
the
taste
was
sweet
perhaps
too
sweet
with
lots
of
bitter
and
fruity
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
too
i
think
the
carbonation
was
decent
but
it
lacked
in
character
compared
to
for
instance
timothy
taylors
landlord
still
its
a
fine
ale
drinkability
if
i
could
find
it
as
fresh
as
the
sixer
i
picked
up
yesterday
id
drink
this
beer
more
often
it
is
often
out

here
in

i
usually
keep
seven
or
eight
types
of
beer
in

but
this

wont
last
until

this
is
definitely
a

theres
a

with
just
enough
carbonation

give
it
at
the
same
time
a
crisp

feeling

is
toasty
and
bready
for
the

sips
but
towards

musty

notes
are
showing
up
oh
well
guess
ill
have
to
have
a
few
more
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
it
was
out
of
a
can
on
a
british
airways
flight
i
remember
liking
it
but
it
wasnt
until
i
had
it
on
tap
again
recently
that
i
really
got
hooked
it
poured
beautifully
with
a
small
fine
head
that
stayed
with
the
beer
and
had
good
lacing
with
a
light
amber
body
the
nose
was
mildy
hoppy
and
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
incredible
mouthfeel
this
is
just
as
good
as
their
esb
dont
miss
out
on
this
especially
if
you
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
taste
is
flavorful
and
well
balanced
good
mix
of
malty
sweetness
and
some
citrus
hoppiness
solid
mouthfeel
without
being
sticky
easy
to
drink
no
one
overpowering
element
a
nice
imported
example
as
are
most
fullers
brews
nice
mouth
feel
some
substance
without
extra
heaviness
very
drinkable
for
the
complexity
of
the
body
this
beer
went
incredibly
well
with
baked
chicken
and
mashed
potatoes
avoiding
heavy
spices
like
excessive
rosemary
that
could
clash
with
this
particular
style
enjoy

beer
pours

with
minimal
head
it
has
a
very

there
are
a

hints
there
is
a
unique
quality
to
the
flavor
that
i
cant
pinpoint
its
bitter
with
some
grassy
flavor
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
overall
its
a
great
beer
very
nice
but
not
all
that
interesting
especially
compared
to
cheaper
domestic

heard
lots

waited
to
try
it
for
the

i
could

and

certainly

pretty
much
a
classic
epa
hard
to
beat
and
easy
to

the
only
real
drawback
to
this
beer
is
it
doesnt
smell
very
good
smells
like
most
of
the
rest
of
the
english
ales
ive
had
a
bit
skunky
it
pours
a
decent
head
and
the
beer
is
an
almost
off
copper
color
not
much
lacing
down

glass
the
taste
is
quite
good
of

and
some

background
followed
by
a

and
some
nice

pretty
decent
session
brew
drinkability
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
example
of
an
english
ale
in
fact
its
one
of
my
personal
favourites
the
caramel
maltiness
balances
wonderfully
with
the
hoppy
bitterness
by
the
time
you
finish
your
first
glass
youll
be
looking
for
seconds
a
good
and
easy
drinking
yet
intriguing
offering
overall
wow
poured
an
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
that
did
not
sustain
very
long
nose
is
maltier
than
most
pales
nothing
much
else
taste
is
maltier
as
well
finishing

apple
hop
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
the

and

bodied

very
good
with

7abv
this
is
another
nice
beer
from
a
brewery
that
it
definitely
worth
a
shot
the
carbonation
is
low
but
theres
a
nice
mediumbodied
feel
that
gives
this
beer
a
bit
of
chewiness
i
can
imagine
drinking
several
of
these
on
tap
at
a
british
pub
taste
is
bitter
and
fruity
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
other
english
beers
i
have
tried
that
typical
english
yeast
the
right
amount
of
caramalt
is
in
here
which
perfectly
balances
the
beer
and
produce
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
copper
colored
with
some
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
bready
with
faint
hops
and
caramel
evenkeeled
earthy
bitterness
up

coupled
with
some
fruit

then
melds
into
bready
malts
with
a
touch
of
toffee
and
hints
of
diacetyl
ends
very
dry
and
well
bittered
through
the
finish
with
a
lasting
impression
of
bread
medium
bodied
with
mid
to
low
carbonation
and
excellent
drinkability
very
well
balanced
and
a
terrific
ale
i
thank
the
guy
with
the
british
accent
who
suggested
it
to
me
in
the
store
i
think
ill
try
their
esb
next
time
notes
simply
a
nice
english
bitter
and
real
tasty
on
cask
id
definitely
recommend
seeking
it
out
in
that
form
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
very
little
substance
here
im
a
big
fan
of
fullers
but
this
is
one
of
their
poorer
brews
in
my
opinion
very
average
british
pale
ale
i
can
sum
up
this
beer
in
one
word
delicious
i
enjoyed
everything
about
drinking
this
beer
the
nose
was
milder
than
the
taste
in
my
opinion
but
everything
was
outstanding
the
finish
was
uncommonly
clean
for
an
ale
with
such
strong
flavors
this
balance
is
quite
impressive
and
i
will
without
a
doubt
seek
this
beer
out
again
whenever
possible
traditionally
pale
ales
arent
always
my
favorites
but
this
stuff
rocks
im
quite
impressed
with
the
clean
hop
notes
in
this
beer
and
i
can
only
imagine
i
managed
to
snag
a
relatively
fresh
beer
the
label
reads
best
before
4172007
which
is
quite
a
ways
off
a
nearperfect
example
of
the
style
and
an
ale
ill
certainly
drink
again
d
it
is
a
very
good
pale
ale
it
wont
overpower
you
with
hops
which
is
why
i
think
it
would
be
great
with
a
meal
overall
an
excellent
and
very
drinkable
pale
ale
recommended
inviting
bronze
color
nice
little

smells
of
biscuit
malty
maybe
a
little
apple
grass
like
a

with
a
little

hop
presence
taste
is
everything
id
want
from
an
english
pale
ale
caramel
malt
biscuit
light
dangerously
drinkable
and
yet
interesting
enough
to
keep
coming
back
to
great
mouthfeel
substantial
but
not
too
thick
nice
mild
hops
on
the
finish
to
encourage
drinkability
pours
a
clear
bright
amber
color
with
a
medium
size
almost
white
head
the
head
fades
down
to
a
small
head
fairly
fast
but
then
hangs
in
there
this
beer
leaves
a
good
lacing
on
the
glass
definite
aroma
mostly
malt
the
taste
is
predominantly
malt
as
well
incredibly
smooth
with
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
this
style
of
beer
not
watery
but
couldnt
be
called
rich
either
drinkability
is
good
average
abv
pleasant
taste
and
smoothness
would
make
this
a
good
session
beer
overall
very
nice
fullers
london
pride
a
heavily
marketed
reasonable
ale
aimed
at
the
masses
probably
a
beer
that
was
in
its
day
memorable
but
now
a
beer
that
is
close
to
bland
certainly
better
than
keg
bitters
but
equally
not
worth
a
special
trip
for
its
a
beer
that
i
will
happily
drink
unless
there
is
something
better
on
the
next
pump
and
sadly
for
fullers
there
often
is
this
is
great
stuff
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
rich
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
no
remarkable
appearance
a
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
fullers
considering
how
much
i
enjoyed
1845
all
and
all
okay
and
i
will
drink
again
depending
on
other
choices
available
but
will
not
seek
this
one
out
poured
a
medium
dark
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
did
i
get
that
right
has
an
above
average
pale
ale
taste
to
it
with
a
distinct
woodyflowery
aftertaste
that
aint
bad
more
complex
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
but
probably
not
worth
twice
or
three
times
as
much
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
good
brew
not
my
favorite
of
fullers
but
one
of
the
better
english
pale
ales
around
though
i
like
it
much
better
on
tap
i
dont
normally
buy
british
beers
outside
of
the
barleywines
porters
stouts
impy
stouts
because
i
think
the
nonroastylowly
hopped
british
beers
just
get
brutalized
in
transit
between
the
brewery
and
the
shelves
of
california
this
beer
though
not
bad
only
reinforced
that
notion
i
suppose
i
shall
just
have
to
travel
to
britain
to
taste
their
beers
when
young
so
fresh
and
so
clean
fullers
has
been
a
brand
i
feel
like
ive
heard
of
but
never
find
so
now
that
ive
found
a
place
that
carries
a
couple
varieties
im
looking
forward
to
getting
better
acquainted
with
it
at
least
until
such
a
time
when
i
can
go
to
england
and
enjoy
it
overall
a
darn
good
and
wellbalanced
pale
ale
recommended
d
very
smooth
easy
refreshing
beer
of
its
style
yes
i
would
have
another
and
another
d
this
is
a
great
english
pale
ale
with
lots
of
great
malt
flavors
that
are
very
subtle
and
a
nice
soft
hop
finish
this
was
meant
to
be
a
session
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
cask
some
day
looks
superficially
like
lager
especially
in
a
500cl
stein
but
this
brew
is
a
genuine
english
ale
with
delightful
complex
aroma
malts
hops
fruit
and
citric
tones
great
fruity
taste
dry
and
firm
body
and
soothing
sweet
finish
coming
out
of
huge
london
brewery
it
feels
an
artisanal
countryside
ale
very
good
pale
ale
one
of
the
best
i
ever
tried
another
winner
from
fullers
i
really
enjoy
the
subtle
complexity
of
this
epa
overall
another
easy
to
drink
offering
from
fullers
d

solid
beer
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
an
overal
dry
but
grainy
almost
oatmeal
like
mix
of
flavors
coating
all
the
tongue
but
especially
the
back
of
the
tongue
eric
d
very
drinkable
i
believe
this
is
my
first
english
pale
ale
simply
an
awesome
brew
totally
different
than
a
apa
maltier
and
less
hoppy
highly
recommended
an
ok
beer
that
id
try
again
in
the
uk
but
not
as
good
as
fullers
esb
my
favorite
english
soccer
teamwest
ham
united
of
londons
east
endcame
up
painfully
short
in
the
fa
cup
final
saturday
it
was
a
bitter
loss
but
also
a
day
that
left
all
ironshammers
supporters
full
of
immense
pride
at
their
underdog
sides
brave
performance
hence
it
was
a
perfect
day
for
fullers
london
pride
this
is
such
a
classic
example
of
its
style
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
its
caramelmalty
aroma
and
golden
copperbrown
appearance
are
extremely
inviting
again
true
to
style
its
flavor
and
body
are
perhaps
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
extremely
drinkable
and
balanced
with
a
straightforward
hop
bitterness
slightly
more
assertive
than
the
caramel
malt
backgroundalthough
the
maltiness
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
the
only
thing
really
limiting
this
styledefining
beer
is
being
served
in
a
bottle
this
refreshing
lightly
carbonated
but
deceptively
flavorful
session
brew
absolutely
demands
being
served
traditionally
caskconditioned
i
am
not
sure
why
this
is
rated
the
way
it
is
i
find
this
absolutely
boring
and
plain
it
is
too
watered
down
and
the
flavors
are
very
average
there
is
no
reason
for
me
to
try
this
one
again
and
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
fullers
beers
i
bought
arent
this
bad
id
avoid
cheers
very
clear
in
appearance
and
copper
in
color
with
a
beige
head
smells
of
hops
and
malt
mild
in
taste
with
a
slight
hops
finish
what
comes
to
mind
is
a
balanced
beer
with
a
decent
taste
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
but
overall
a
drinkable
pale
ale
i
would
add
this
beer
to
the
list
of
beers
i
would
probably
enjoy
more
if
i
had
it
on
draught
on
my
top
five
d
easy
drinking
but
tasty
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
creamy
light
tan
foam
that
clinged
to
the
glass
and
slowly
settled
there
was
a
good
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
nice
and
malty
with
a
good
aroma
of
english
hops
the
taste
was
dryly
malty
with
chalky
hops
and
a
light
fruitiness
the
beer
was
wellbalanced
with
mild
bitterness
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
hoppiness
and
light
fruitiness
lingered
in
the
finish
this
was
a
great
session
beer
and
even
tasted
great
straight
from
the
bottle
drinkability
painfully
sessionable
this
is
a
good
one
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
overcarbonated
drinkability
is
decent
at
best
i
find
myself
almost
choking
this
down
d
great
appearance
and
mouthfeel
but
the
smell
and
taste
leave
something
to
be
desired
overall
this
gets
a
meh
rating
from
me
taste
slightly
bitter
and
floral
hops
bread
dough
and
caramel
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
fruitiness
in
the
finish
theres
a
bit
of
a
buttery
quality
that
makes
me
knock
this
down
a
notch
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
d
high
with
a
refreshing
bitter
twang
at
the
end
a
nice
copperredish
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
disappates
very
quickly
alot
of
aromas
some
citrus
and
others
related
to
hops
but
the
prominant
scent
was
one
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
rather
surprising
very
malty
with
a
smack
of
bitterness
at
the
end
that
bitterness
lingers
in
the
mouth
long
after
each
sip
in
the
mouth
it
is
medium
bodied
and
leaves
a
nice
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
overall
i
was
expecting
more
hop
flavor
like
american
pale
ales
but
this
beer
is
smooth
and
mellow
a
nice
after
work
beer
to
sit
down
and
just
relax
it
could
make
a
good
session
or
starter
beer
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
comes
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
much
to
the
glass
but
hung
around
for
most
of
the
tasting
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
fruity
toasted
malts
come
out
the
most
with
a
faint
hop
aroma
taste
fantastic
starts
off
a
little
malty
faintly
sweet
with
hops
coming
through
a
bit
at
the
finish
goes
down
very
easy
dangerously
drinkable
a
musttry
for
those
who
prefer
this
style
a
very
well
balanced
earthy
and
highly
drinkable
ale
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
with
little
effort
london
pride
is
an
outstanding
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
the
aroma
is
delicate
with
nice
balance
of
light
floral
hop
and
toasty
malt
notes
the
flavor
is
extremely
well
balanced
starting
with
rich
yet
not
overpowering
toastytoffee
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
long
and
dry
but
not
intense
hop
profile
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
round
extremely
drinkablevery
refreshing
an
excellent
session
beer
the
drinkability
in
this
beer
is
quite
high
like
most
fullers
products
ive
sampled
an
old
favorite
overall
this
beer
is
aptly
named
london
should
be
very
proud
of
this
one
a
great
ale
typical
english
ale
appearance
light
copper
body
holds
a
thin
white
head
which
recedes
quickly
smelled
of
old
growth
fruit
orchard
and
loam
malty
and
slightly
sweet
tatse
in
the
front
fading
to
bitter
with
a
suprising
amount
of
hops
but
not
nearly
as
bitter
as
many
american
pales
as
it
should
be
highly
drinkable
a
solid
beer
but
not
in
the
ranks
of
the
great
i
would
drink
it
again
but
will
not
purchase
this
frequently
all
in
all
a
nice
ale
that
is
almost
too
easy
to
drink
the
malt
and
hop
balance
are
spot
on
and
there
was
not
much
carbonation
which
added
nicely
to
the
drinkability
it
was
at
this
point
that
i
also
adopted
my
try
only
ales
that
you
had
not
heard
of
mission
i
crossed
this
venerable
star
off
my
list
and
started
focussing
on
smaller
regional
breweries
but
this
is
still
a
good
one
if
you
cant
find
a
local
on
handpump
at
an
elephant
and
castle
the
beer
poured
a
clear
copperish
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
the
aroma
is
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
maltiness
that
is
pleasing
to
the
nose
the
taste
gives
you
a
balance
between
the
malty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
a
foral
hop
bite
overall
the
beer
is
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
especially
on
the
handpump
d
my
first
impression
didnt
last
long
this
is
definitely
an
above
average
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again

a
shadow
of

poured

mainly
of

and
has
a
slight

nice
crisp

finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
with
fair
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
english
pale
ale
i
tried
it
after
an
apa
anchor
liberty
ale
and
it
was
nice
to
notice
the
differences
in
the
styles
of
the
two
countries
i
thought
this
was
quite
good
and
would
buy
it
again
fullers
knows
what
theyre
doing
regardless
of
score
i
seem
to
end
up
being
uninspired
by
whatever

is

3

and
so
on
good
for
the
category
or
bad
for
the
beer
this
beer
is
basic
if
its
the
genesis
of
the
pale
ale
category
then
it
deserves
much
props

the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
has
an
awesome
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
carapils
and
bisquit
malts
along
with
a
wonderful
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
earthy
and
mildly
bitter
it
is
a
bit
weak
in
the
malt
department
but
it
has
a
nice
complex
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
pale
ales
ive
ever
tried
it
has
tremendous
aroma
and
flavor
a
fine
sessions
ale
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
that
is
light
in
the
mouth
and
easy
to
drink
if
you
go
to
a
pub
and
they
have
this
on
tap
you
may
have
just
died
and
gone
to
heaven
or
you
may
be
in
england
but
either
way
have
two
or
three
for
me
d
pretty
good
wonder
if
this
stuff
can
be
found
on
tap
ambercaramel
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
strong
toffee
aromas
with
some
fruit
in
the
background
i
can
recognize
the
challenger
hops
in
this
one
as
i
often
use
them
in
my
homebrewed
bitters
caramel
malts
dominate
the
palate
with
a
clean
bittering
quality
providing
some
balance
not
really
enough
hop
contribution
in
the
flavor
department
for
my
taste
but
a
a
solid
bitter
nonetheless
id
probably
find
this
beer
cloying
after
more
than
one
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
will
be
buying
it
again
and
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
next
time
pours
a
deep
copperyamber
with
a
creamy
light
beige
head
that
built
to
about
2
fingers
before
dissipating
slowly
and
leaving
a
nice
ring
around
the
glass
good
lacing
smells
malty
butter
and
caramel
coming
through
with
a
strong
herbal
hoppy
overtone
light
coffee
as
well
malty
at
first
with
strong
toffee
flavours
and
a
bit
of
butter
hops
come
through
well
in
the
finish
light
citrus
and
peppery
bitterness
feels
creamy
and
substantial
with
a
crisp
finish
and
is
supremely
drinkable
an
absolutely
classic
example
of
a
style
that
is
one
of
my
favourites
very
faint
malty
sweetness
was
overpowered
by
a
light
sulfur
and
hops
aroma
great
tasting
session
brew
that
was
lightly
biting
with
the
hops
on
the
front
end
but
finished
smooth
and
creamy
appeared
widely
available
became
my
best
drinkable
option
while
in
the
bars
of
the
uk
overall
a
nice
beer
very
good
example
of
the
style
bham
uk
mouthfeeldrinkability
crisp
and
active
in
the
mouth
without
being
harsh
and
certainly
food
friendly
sessionable
all
day
long
with
its
low
abv
a
nice
but
rather
expensive
british
alternative
to
my
easydrinking
local
favorites
drinkability
is
sky
high
every
time
i
have
an
english
bitterpale
aleesb
i
want
to
move
to
the
uk
and
spend
all
my
days
in
the
pub
drinking
them
from
cask
but
maybe
thats
just
me
overall
respectable
brew
although
id
seek
out
other
fullers
before
this
oen
inoffensive
but
not
exciting
suitable
for
weaning
someone
off
of
macros
her
taste
was
very
flat
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
dont
know
but
the
beer
was
flat
the
experience
was
quite
flat
very
malty
beer
with
some
notes
of
butter
that
came
a
floral
flavours
came
from
the
hops
but
in
a
very
very
shy
manner
ok
to
drink
not
nearly
as
good
as
my
memories
of
drinking
it
on
tap
kind
of
plain
pours
a
nice
orangey
amber
with
a
moderate
head
of
dense
white
bubbles
a
few
strings
of
carbonation
laze
their
way
to
the
top
the
smell
is
of
mild
malt
sweetness
with
some
spicy
hops
initial
hop
crispness
followed
by
the
toasty
malt
and
some
caramelbutter
as
well
moderate
carbonation
peppers
the
tongue
well
rounded
and
quite
drinkable
a
wonderful
session
beer
and
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
a
vibrant
orangecopper
color
with
eggshell
colored
head
moderate
retention
and
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
fruit
but
the
hops
dominate
the
taste
is
interesting
in
that
the
bitterness
melts
into
a
sweetness
that
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sour
as
the
beer
warms
the
bitterness
gives
way
to
greater
sweetness
and
dryness
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
dry
with
a
touch
of
sour
the
drinkability
is
less
than
would
be
expected
because
the
dry
character
of
the
beer
makes
it
less
appealing
subsequent
times
at
least
for
me
pours
a
beautiful
goldencopper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
considerably
malty
more
so
than
expected
theres
a
little
hops
a
bit
of
fruit
and
a
slight
diacetyl
smell
as
well
altogether
the
aroma
is
pretty
enticing
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
and
a
little
drier
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
relatively
low
carbonation
very
good
head
retention
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
satisfied
the
beer
doesnt
present
much
of
a
wow
factor
but
it
does
stand
up
very
nicely
as
a
solidly
drinkable
pale
ale
followed
this
up
with
a
up
with
a
big
beer
turns
out
london
pride
set
the
stage
nicely
i
have
had
a
few
pints
of
this
on
tap
in
london
in
dec
2004
and
quite
enjoyed
them
d
this
is
just
really
strange
tasting
i
have
to
try
this
again
some
time
8

6pack
poured
a
perfectly
clear
medium
copper
color
with
respectable
white
head
that
quickly
fell
to
a
moderate
ring
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
malty
toastly
caramelly
buttery
and
very
nice
taste
is
a
sweet
maltiness
toasty
with
a
hop
dryness
slowing
coming
through
finished
more
dry
than
malty
and
very
pleasant
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
was
finished
before
i
knew
it
good
job
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
id
have
no
problem
ordering
it
at
a
bar
if
this
were
their
only
english
pa
and
i
were
in
the
mood
but
for
drinking
at
home
i
prefer
sam
smiths
organic
ale
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
though
and
the
two
would
make
for
a
good
headtohead
tasting
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
pricey
english
pale
ales
out
here
but
since
im
trying
to
finish
out
my
list
in
a
local
beer
club
it
was
worth
the
shot
just
as
good
as
many
pale
ales
but
nothing
so
exciting
to
make
me
want
this
one
over
others
nice
hops
and
great
mouthfeel
quite
easy
to
drink
nothing
else
too
great
but
nothing
disappointing
either
teaser
actually
said
if
this
is
what
english
beer
is
like
then
im
happy
to
visit
anytime
ill
hold
her
to
that
drinkability
i
cant
imagine
it
getting
anymore
drinkable
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
just
really
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
this
being
really
great
on
cask
another
brew
i
would
have
no
problem
sessioning
as
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
easy
well
worth
your
time
and
probably
worth
a
trip
to
the
uk
as
well
review
made
from
notes
on
tap
at
barleys
notes
of
baked
goods
oatmeal
cookies
and
light
hops
copper

poured
with
no
head
little
evidence
of
carbonation
breadybiscuity
caramel
malts
floralperfumy
hop
flavor
at
bit
on
the
thin
side
watery
with
little
carbonation
all
said
this
was
a
very
ordinary
beer
the
grainy
maltiness
is
balanced
with
the
mild
hops
the
hops
are
green
and
impart
a
very
slight
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
short
while
not
very
complex
by
any
means
but
a
pleasant
brew
semi
copper
color
with
a
nice
medium
tan
head
aroma
is
of
a
toasted
grain
quality
followed
by
a
caramel
sweetness
and
then
a
slightly
spicy
quality
taste
has
more
caramel
sweetness
and
toasted
bread
upfront
in
that
traditional
english
ale
quality
body
is
a
bit
buttery
and
really
smooth
on
the
light
side
but
it
works
well
for
this
beer
hops
seem
a
little
fruity
at
first
but
finish
with
a
little
of
that
spicy
flavor
i
got
from
the
aroma
good
beer
in
all
fullers
can
do
no
wrong
imo
tried
it
on
cask
before
from
the
bottle
this
time
pours
a
solid
to
dark
copper
with
golden
and
ruby
highlights
a
full
off
white
head
diminishes
to
a
trace
and
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
decidedly
malty
and
caramelly
with
sligh
hop
spiciness
in
the
background
maybe
a
bit
buttery
tastes
also
malty
and
caramelly
sweetness
is
full
and
rich
up
front
tapers
a
bit
over
the
toung
leaving
hop
resins
to
dominate
english
hop
flavor
adds
spiciness
and
a
bit
metalic
not
from
oxidation
but
from
hop
flavor
body
weakens
into
the
finish
leaving
the
beer
a
suprisingly
thin
slight
buttery
flavors
and
slickness
are
present
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
despite
a
few
flaws
this
is
a
plesant
tasting
beer
pours
an
orangishgolden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
background
of
floral
hops
taste
begins
with
a
bready
flavor
followed
by
a
light
caramel
sweetness
and
a
lingering
floral
hops
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
cream
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
english
pale
a
bit
hoppier
than
expected
but
still
an
excellent
choice
this
beer
came
from
the
tap
a
deep
copper
color
very
clear
there
was
little
to
no
head
on
the
beer
but
i
blame
that
on
the
pour
ive
had
this
beer
before
although
not
reviewed
and
there
was
no
issue
i
think
it
was
just
the
1st
pour
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
nose
is
all
malt
with
caramel
and
toffee
it
really
smells
like
candy
the
taste
is
fruity
apple
pear
with
lots
of
caramel
there
is
ieven
more
toffee
in
the
flavor
than
i
detected
in
the
nose
slick
light
mouth
feel
decent
drinkability
appearance
is
translucent
amber
with
beige
foam
and
long
lived
lace
aroma
has
notes
of
toast
crackers
toffee
brown
sugar

and
lots
of
hops
initial
taste
is
of
justright
carbonation
malt
sourdough
bread
sweet
butter
and
bitter
hops
finish
leaves
apricot
hops
on
your
tongue
masterfully
crafted
overall
this
beer
was
a
let
down
i
have
had
great
experiences
with
the
other
fullers
products
but
this
one
seemed
to
be
more
of
an
average
brew
it
is
probably
better
on
draft
in
the
uk
i
will
have
to
try
it
there
someday
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
red
color
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
starts
out
a
respectable
two
fingers
thick
the
aroma
is
nice
it
is
a
good
mix
of
hoppy
malty
and
fruity
notes
i
get
aromatic
notes
of
herbs
lemons
cherries
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
quite
light
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
herbal
hoppiness
to
this
beer
up
front
and
it
carries
through
to
the
finish
the
finish
has
a
pleasing
bitterness
to
it
but
also
has
a
bit
of
citrusy
lemon
character
to
it
the
taste
has
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
this
has
a
really
nice
maltiness
to
it
that
really
compliments
the
hop
notes
quite
well
this
is
an
eminently
quaffable
beer
that
is
really
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
though
it
is
balanced
towards
the
hoppy
side
of
the
spectrum
drinkability
is
as
it
does
i
love
this
stuff
but
because
its
not
available
all
over
the
place
i
consider
this
a
once
in
awhile
treat
otherwise
ill
be
deprived
overall
got
this
on
sale
for
3
99
a
6pack
the
store
was
overstocked
and
it
was
getting
close
to
the
best
by
date
glad
i
picked
this
up
because
its
a
nice
change
from
what
i
have
been
drinking
big
12
oz
bottle
best
by
91605
served
chilled
in
a
nonic
pours
a
honeyamber
with
a
beautiful
2
finger
offwhite
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
lots
of
diacetyl
in
the
aroma
butterybutterscotch
with
caramel
some
hops
and
a
hint
of
metal
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
some
citric
character
in
the
hops
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
malts
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
that
isnt
too
tingly
and
is
overall
very
smooth
the
only
thing
that
detracts
from
this
being
a
session
beer
is
the
price
fairly
drinkable
beer
although
maybe
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
well
started
out
with
a
nice
clear
amber
body
with
a
tan
head
great
lacing
throughout
the
glass
aroma
of
malts
and
citrus
taste
included
these
and
some
lemon
very
low
hop
kick
but
low
carbonation
made
for
one
you
could
drink
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
not
very
exciting
and
somewhat
thin
but
still
tasty
enough
to
go
back
for
another
full
coppertoned
body
with
golden
highlights
thick
dense
cap
of
creamy
offkhaki
head
nose
is
light
sugary
biscuit
malt
a
whiff
of
toffee
but
predominantly
slightly
resinous
herbally
bitter
hops
toasted
caramel
biscuit
malt
flavors
up
front
nice
even
bitterness
intrudes
with
good
floral
herbal
hop
flavor
nice
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
minerally
finish
medium
bodied
probably
better
on
cask
but
not
bad
on
nitro
oelergud
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
very
plain
and
simple
this
beer
is
smooth
and
extremely
mild
and
drinkable
the
only
negative
is
that
due
to
the
flatness
lack
of
carbonation
i
could
see
growing
tired
of
it
after
a
couplefew
clear
copper
color
13
of
offwhite
head
pretty
standard
stuff
for
an
epa
smell
is
carmely
and
light
floral
hops
some
diacetyl
taste
is
well
hopped
grapefruit
in
nature
starts
sweet
and
ends
could
be
more
carbonated
but
ok
seems
underpowered
compared
to
the
hoppier
and
more
flavorful
apas
but
for
an
epa
not
bad
medium
light
mouth
feel
and
warm
bitter
finish
makes
this
an
outstanding
beer
to
drink
all
night
and
or
offer
to
a
sam
adams
or
bass
drinker
for
a
step
up
overall
a
nice
ale
and
well
recommended
pleasing
and
drinkable
one
of
the
standardbearers
of
english
pale
ale
a
nice
upgrade
over
the
last
beer
i
reviewed
poured
a
very
nice
amber
color
very
clear
only
a
slight
head
and
stringy
lace
nose
is
bready
malty
and
fruity
apples
and
apricots
taste
is
very
simple
but
very
full
lots
of
sweet
malts
but
balanced
with
nice
subtle
hops
a
nice
slight
bready
feel
was
on
the
tongue
other
than
the
perfect
balance
there
is
not
much
more
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
the
malts
just
coat
the
inside
of
tghe
cheeks
ver
smooth
drinking
and
quite
pleasant
finish
incredibly
drinkable
incredibly
balanced
i
will
be
having
this
again
sometime
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
is
ample
and
it
is
very
thirst
quenching
and
suitable
for
a
session
brew
very
drinkable
even
for
hot
weather
copper
color
with
reddish
tints
pours
with
a
thin
head
the
head
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
very
low
carbonation
once
the
head
is
gone
theres
little
sign
of
activity
in
this
beer
smell
is
malty
bready
fairly
light
taste
is
mostly
the
malt
backbone
with
some
very
subtle
hoppiness
i
expected
more
out
of
this
brew
it
just
seemed
rather
bland
and
unexciting
to
me
the
minimal
carbonation
almost
makes
it
seem
as
though
its
flat
but
despite
those
concerns
its
a
decent
brew
and
obviously
well
crafted
bright
very
bright
orange
decent
capsized
head
buttery
sweet
malts
and
some
chestnuts
roasted
on
the
nose
sharp
and
bitter
hops
coupled
with
a
decent
blast
of
fresh
bread
tastiness
medium
bodied
all
the
way
becomes
increasingly
dry
ultrasmooth
and
clean
palate
diacetyl
noticeable
along
with
some
tender
caramel
malts
just
a
tinge
of
carbonation
lush
and
enjoyable
the
true
standardclassic
english
pale
ale
cheers
this
was
a
very
drinkable
ale
even
in
the
cans
wpould
love
to
taste
this
on
draught
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
the
low
carbonation
makes
this
a
wonderful
and
flavorful
session
ale
i
thought
this
was
just
fantastic
it
poured
a
copperlike
colour
with
a
snow
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
sticky
lace
ring
in
just
few
seconds
the
lace
clings
nicely
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
just
delicious
it
takes
something
special
for
me
to
hand
out
a
5
0
the
smell
is
full
of
malt
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
hops
there
is
quite
a
noticeable
caramel
smell
as
well
its
just
so
well
balanced
not
too
much
or
too
little
of
anything
a
masterpiece
the
taste
is
quite
lovely
as
well
with
a
robust
maltiness
in
the
beginning
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
hoppy
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
so
smooth
and
almost
buttery
this
is
also
very
drinkable
a
great
session
brew
or
one
to
simply
sip
on
and
savour
absolutely
smashing
clear
deep
orange
and
perhaps
tobacco
tinged
brew
a
quick
white
head
but
plenty
of
carbonation
a
malty
nose
a
bit
grassy
lots
of
hops
and
then
a
crisp
taste
of
malt
fruity
and
buttery
nicely
balanced
bitter
hops
finish
love
this
beer
delicious
nice
body
very
drinkable
a
favorite
pale
ale

dated

before

im
a
little
late
pours
a
light

with
a

light

poor
retention
and
scant

low

consistent
with
an
english

with
a

of
the

buttery
diacetyl
taste
with
a
slightly
hoppy
drier
finish
trace
vegetal
notes
lighter

very
drinkable
and
carbonation
level
is
just
right
a
very
nice
english
pale
ale
that
is
a
benchmark
of
the
style
this
would
have
to
be
great
on
cask
beautiful
copper
color
with
an
ample
white
head
herbal
aroma
malt
dominates
with
butterscotchtoffee
flavors
hops
stay
quiet
in
in
the
back
but
still
provide
decent
balance
very
drinkable
smooth
ale
nothing
terribly
complex
rather
straight
forward
but
the
overall
effect
is
very
good
the
taste
was
one
of
the
best
parts
of
the
beer
as
it
should
be
it
starts
off
with
sweet
malts
and
finishes
dry
with
a
generous
aftertaste
of
british
hops
the
body
is
light
to
medium
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
i
cant
wait
to
have
it
on
tap
soon
at
my
local
watering
hole
reflection
this
is
a
very
good
ale
but
i
can
think
of
quite
a
few
local
breweries
that
i
would
rather
buy
from
that
make
ales
of
this
caliber
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
sessiontype
english
paler
ale
to
be
honest
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
the
english
varieties
a
few
but
to
me
this
one
is
very
good
the
taste
is
very
nice
bringing
loads
of
smooth
and
rich
malts
through
without
being
overpowering
something
about
the
smell
seemed
funny
but
that
wasnt
bad
either
the
mouthfeel
holds
the
richness
and
smoothness
of
the
taste
pours
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
making
for
a
big
fluffy
white
head
not
much
in
in
the
way
of
aroma
a
hoppy
spicy
beer
and
surprisingly
clean
tasting
for
an
english
ale
pours
as
clear
as
most
pilsners
wheres
the
yeast
this
is
obviously
not
a
bottleconditioned
ale
almost
reminds
of
a
little
bit
of
the
last
pilsner
urquell
i
had
but
his
is
supposed
to
be
an
ale
right
a
good
beer
but
lacking
some
of
the
traits
of
other
english
beers
from
other
breweries
i
iike
youngs
or
adnams
for
example
the
mouthfeel
body
and
fruitiness
contributed
by
the
yeast
a
bit
of
a
dispointment
in
terms
of
the
style
but
is
good
for
impersonating
a
nice
spicy
pilsner
simply
a
classic
english
pale
ale
i
love
the
big
muted
hop
notes
it
reminds
me
of
sitting
in
an
english
pub
even
better
if
you
can
find
it
on
cask
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
long
great
beer
in
the
cask
far
better
than
the
bottled
version
as
the
bitterness
is
much
more
rounded
out
the
beer
poured
off
with
little
head
maybe
14
but
it
lasted
most
the
way
to
the
bottom
nice
copperorangey
color
a
bit
hazy
smell
was
great
creamy
malt
aromas
and
nice
floral
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
though
was
awesome
again
creamy
malt
texture
biscuitcookielike
flavors
finishing
with
delicate
hops
nice
malt
finish
too
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
and
i
did
that
one
night
hot
damn
we
have
cask
ale
in
lexington
this
beer
came
off
the
firkin
a
golden
amber
color
with
just
a
coat
of
head
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
was
sweet
caramel
with
deep
grainey
tones
but
not
bad
i
like
it
the
flavor
was
good
caramel
sweetness
with
a
nice
background
of
sweet
grain
that
finished
with
a
really
nice
hop
bitter
the
feel
was
silkey
smooth
and
creamy
and
just
a
nice
drink
my
only
problem
is
that
the
beer
was
served
way
too
cold
for
a
cask
ale
but
letting
it
sit
took
care
of
that
still
highly
drinkable
and
awesome
a
very
nice
and
easilydrunk
beer
very
well
balanced
a
good
beer
my
first
from
fullers
im
not
this
styles
biggest
fan
but
this
beer
would
not
be
avoided
a
very
good
session
ale
fullers
have
again
impressed
me
on
cask
its
even
more
drinkable
as
the
carbonation
isnt
as
aggressive
drinkability
the
easiest
drinking
ale
ive
tried
if
youre
drinking
apas
you
need
to
try
this
to
see
how
the
mellower
half
lives
had
this
on
cask
at
the
local
pub
cool
hand
pump
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
very
small
head
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
didnt
expect
the
cask
version
to
have
much
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
the
flavor
was
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
has
a
caramel
flavor
with
nice
hop
presence
very
nice
on
cask
i
recommend
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
has
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lace
there
is
very
little
hops
in
the
nose
but
the
bready
malty
aroma
is
inviting
i
have
never
had
a
english
pale
ale
before
so
this
was
a
total
surprise
to
me
the
subdued
hoppiness
and
strong
malty
character
is
vastly
different
from
the
american
interpretation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
is
surely
going
to
grow
on
me
the
more

color
with
large
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
head
head
is
made
up
of
those
same
large
bubbles
in
an
offwhite
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
fruity
apple
cider
like
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
sour
and
sweet
with
bready
malt
flavors
and
some
weak
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
its
a
reasonable
beer
to
drink
but
nothing
particularly
special
excellent
drinkability
ideal
as
a
session
ale
and
the
prototypical
english
pale
ale
drinkability
a
dependable
english
pa
best
paired
with
an
order
of
fishnchips
500ml
bottle
poured
a
decent
coppergold
with
a
smallish
tight
cap
moderate
carbonation
aromas
of
spice
apples
some
pine
prickly
mouth
feel
from
over
carbonation
for
the
style
imho
hop
pronounced
malts
take
a
back
seat
but
deliver
a
distinct
sweet
biscuit
taste
that
is
not
overpowered
by
the
well
balanced
pine
woody
hops
a
smooth
and
mildish
character
in
a
standard
for
the
style
mid
gold
with
a
thick
head
this
beer
belies
a
malty
nose
that
suggests
old
breweries
and
tradition
the
taste
is
flowery
malty
with
subtle
hops
with
the
clincher
coming
with
a
great
finish
the
great
english
ales
are
very
complex
in
ways
that
only
contemplation
can
produce
a
true
classic
pride
poured
a
light
amber
colour
with
an
offwhite
thick
head
that
is
quite
long
lasting
very
tiny
bubbles
slowly
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
and
hard
to
detect
the
beer
could
be
more
aromatic
a
malty
smell
is
all
i
can
get
a
very
nice
rich
taste
a
smooth
malty
caramel
or
some
kind
of
sweets
a
taste
of
toffee
or
nuts
lingers
at
the
end
this
is
a
great
ale
smooth
not
really
bitter
and
quite
drinkable
too
this
beer
is
made
for
sucking
back
pints
at
a
pub
overall
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
english
ale
this
is
your
beer
good
character
and
great
english
toffee
taste
granting
myself
the
last
word
fullers
seems
like
a
topnotch
outfit
i
can
think
of
no
reason
not
to
consider
them
for
best
british
brewery
and
an
automatic
contender
for
best
world
brewery
sticky
doughy
creamcolored
almost
white

yes
this
is
just
a
fabulous
english
ale
picked
up
on
my
latest
beer
run
12
oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
12apr04
about
5
months
past
its
prime
appearance
is
copper
with
a
small
white
head
which
initially
consisted
of
large
bubbles
aroma
has
very
pronounced
breadlike
qualities
a
lot
of
malt
in
this
pale
i
guess
a
little
bit
of
nut
aroma
slips
through
as
well
taste
backs
up
the
aroma
well
a
very
strong
malt
body
is
the
dominating
force
in
this
beer
the
nut
flavor
is
present
as
well
pretty
well
balanced
if
you
are
a
malt
lover
mouthfeel
is
nice
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
but
i
seem
to
prefer
my
pale
ales
to
have
more
floral
qualities
i
guess
english
pale
ale
is
not
my
style
but
im
definately
glad
i
sampled
at
least
1
old
fashioned
candy
flavor
at
first
and
then
a
sweet
malty
finish
very
drinkable
english
pale
ale
excellent
balance
with
just
enough
of
a
hop
presence
tasty
session
beer
736
overall
a
perfect
beer
a
great
session
beer
one
of
my
favourite
english
pale
ales
a
very
strong
example
of
the
traditional
english
ale
albeit
close
to
an
esb
in
flavor
with
the
extra
touch
of
hops
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
colored
beer
with
a
medium
head
and
standard
retention
aroma
is
quite
malty
and
the
same
applies
to
the
taste
well
balance
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
another
standard
english
ale
in
bottle
which
im
starting
to
think
taste
all
the
same
im
wondering
if
those
beers
should
only
be
drink
form
a
cask
to
truly
appreciate
them
overall
this
is
not
bad
nor
good
just
standard
crystal
clear
coppery
colour
longlasting
white
head
fresh
hop
aroma
with
light
grain
and
some
toasted
crisp
carbonation
to
start
with
a
very
smooth
texture
that
follows
hop
bitterness
is
more
dominant
in
the
bottle
than
when
ontap
and
maltfruit
flavours
are
more
mild
a
mild
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
ps
its
great
that
the
fullers
stock
at
shangys
is
always
super
fresh
its
not
as
good
as
cask
but
its
the
next
best
thing
on
cask
its
light
and
understaed
but
flavorful
and
my
review
score
is
based
on
that
sessionable
and
melts
in
the
mouth
bottle
more
bitter
hops
but
also
more
caramel
toffee
biscuit
malt
sweetness
noticeable
in
the
bottle
than
the
tap
i
have
previously
tried
very
drinkable
and
on
lightmedium
fulness
side
pours
out
a
perfect
amber
colour
with
a
thick
luscious
off
white
head
bready
toasty
aroma
with
just
enough
floral
english
hopping
to
balance
plentiful
lacing
flavours
of
fresh
bread
dough
and
toasted
crackers
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
notes
come
through
hopping
for
flavour
with
little
bitterness
balanced
all
around
the
body
is
relatively
light
with
a
mouthfeel
thats
rounded
and
crisp
finishes
dry
and
wanting
another
sip
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
high
drinkability
because
of
the
lower
abv
and
lessened
flavour
profile
a
perfect
session
ale
would
be
a
perfect
compliment
to
some
pub
grub
as
a
gold
standard
for
across
the
pond
pale
ales
fullers
london
pride
is
solid
in
all
respects
though
again
i
prefer
the
american
version
of
the
style
this
beers
relatively
restrained
use
of
hops
allows
it
to
be
consumed
in
quantity
without
risking
palate
fatigue
im
glad
that
its
available
less
than
5
minutes
from
my
house
for
those
admittedly
rare
cases
when
i
dont
have
a
u
s
hop
crave
goin
on
ooooh
am
i
ever
glad
craig
brought
me
this
ive
been
searching
at
home
for
this
and
he
found
it
while
working
in
ottawa
i
gotta
give
him
a
reward
for
this
nice
amber
red
with
subtle
hues
of
orange
big
fluffy
head
that
disipates
slowly
to
nothing
but
by
then
the
glass
is
almost
empty
lace
coats
the
glass
like
a
curtain
beautiful
extremely
well
balanced
smell
of
malt
and
hops
even
a
bit
of
a
yeast
strain
smell
i
like
it
alot
taste
starts
out
crisp
and
mellow
then
this
full
flavoured
malt
profile
kicks
in
like
kung
fu
nice
i
like
it
leaves
pleasantly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
definitely
a
full
bodied
beer
not
a
heavy
body
but
full
sinfully
drinkable
id
drive
all
the
way
to
ottawa
to
get
a
couple
bottles
of
this
bliss
a
very
nice
looking
amber
pour
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
with
subtle
fruity
hints
taste
wise
its
light
fruitiness
up
front
that
quickly
turns
to
a
malty
body
down
the
middle
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
fizzy
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
dryish
with
a
metallic
sorta
zip
to
it
nice
light
hoppiness
an
average
beer
in
my
books
beer
is
good
happy
beering
just
had
this
one
again
on
draught
at
st
andrews
in
nyc
last
week
while
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
bottle
you
must
have
it
on
draught
to
truly
enjoy
it
st
andrews
also
keeps
it
at
the
proper
temperature
so
that
the
true
flavour
abounds
the
mouthfeel
was
particularly
wonderful
and
taste
is
always
good
well
ill
be
going
back
to
the
bottle
version
as
i
dont
get
the
draught
up
here
in
nw
connecticut
one
of
my
favourite
session
beersfull
stop
this
hit
the
spot
i
would
have
had
a
few
more
if
they
werent
five
bucks
per
can
poured
out
a
rusty
copper
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
in
there
that
leaves
a
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
was
a
little
light
it
was
mostly
malts
blended
in
with
some
hops
very
light
though
some
caramel
and
a
light
floral
aroma
taste
is
quite
good
malts
hit
the
palate
big
time
and
lasts
through
the
aftertaste
in
between
some
caramel
and
sweetness
flavors
blend
in
to
balance
this
brew
out
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
was
almost
perfect
i
thought
it
let
the
flavors
show
their
punch
perhaps
on
the
best
session
beers
out
there
a
tawny
gold
with
white
foam
scudding
over
the
top
faint
toffee
scent
a
touch
of
bitterness
bites
into
the
appley
malt
which
seems
covered
with
butterscotch
with
more
butterscotch
in
the
finish
served
too
cold
again
as
well
sigh
found
this
one
in
the
singles
cooler
at
whole
foods
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
light
foamy
head
nice
aroma
of
roasted
malt
biscuit
and
a
light
fruitiness
beautiful
palate
of
sweet
malt
very
light
hops
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
wonderful
creamy
mouthfeel
allows
the
maltiness
to
linger
on
the
palate
a
great
beer
to
say
the
least
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
this
one
poured
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
very
big
frothy
white
head
that
coated
the
whole
glass
with
lace
the
smell
was
pretty
light
with
a
slight
hoppiness
and
a
very
bready
scent
as
well
the
taste
was
super
balanced
with
a
very
light
hoppiness
medum
malt
presence
and
a
great
earthy
taste
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
the
mouthfeel
was
so
light
and
airy
off
the
cask
it
was
great
a
true
session
beer
indeed
a
benchmark
bitter
it
pours
a
bright
orange
color
with
a
generous
and
long
lasting
rocky
head
half
the
head
must
stay
behind
on
the
glass
the
lacing
is
copious
the
smell
is
citrusy
perhaps
grapefruit
piney
and
possibly
ginger
the
taste
is
refreshing
with
cedary
hop
notes
and
a
solid
malt
background
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
is
very
balanced
the
carbonation
is
generous
with
medium
sized
bubbles
that
make
for
an
active
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
an
excellent
session
beer
fullers
is
one
the
best
english
breweries
for
sure
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
quite
easily
and
you
can
have
quite
a
few
before
you
start
feeling
the
alcohol
a
good
session
beer
or
a
dinner
quaff
now
if
only
the
barmaid
had
brought
a
proper
pour
from
the
keg
a
great
brew
and
one
that
i
will
return
to
often
all
considered
this
is
a
very
well
made
effort
it
is
restrained
yet
complex
and
interesting
i
will
definitely
have
another
very
good
colour
a
nice
copper
head
is
a
dense
off
white
but
only
about
34
thick
smell
is
clean
with
a
very
good
smelling
mild
hops
at
first
taste
i
was
a
bit
surprised
the
the
hops
did
not
stand
out
as
much
a
nice
smooth
malt
flavour
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
very
drinkable
a
very
good
beer
that
lots
of
different
people
could
enjoy
this
beer
should
be
a
world
standard
for
good
drinkable
beer
light
to
medium
feel
light
bitterness
great
session
beer
drinkability
just
a
great
pale
ale
may
be
underrated
due
to
expectations
based
on
american
pales
what
doesnt
this
brewery
do
right
you
need
to
try
this
one
id
like
to
make
this
my
every
day
beer
pours
a
copper
color
clear
liquid
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
disappeared
fairly
quickly
smells
slightly
skunky
woodsy
and
earthy
not
really
a
great
smell
taste
is
much
more
pleasant
not
much
malt
sweetness
but
more
of
a
toasted
flavor
with
a
very
dry
hop
bitterness
not
much
hop
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
not
too
thin
at
all
this
seems
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
the
nose
is
a
bit
malty
hints
of
white
toast
with
honey
hoppiness
alludes
to
grapefruit
but
its
thin
but
man
what
an
incredibly
balanced
beautiful
simple
flavor
simple
pale
malts
melba
snacks
and
homemade
biscuits
with
a
crunch
mingle
with
the
most
pleasant
estery
middle
and
a
great
leafy
herbal
hop
finish
simple
but
excellent
and
ohsolight
beer
bliss
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
well
balanced
session
brew
not
a
huge
fan
of
british
ales
but
this
one
really
did
it
for
me
this
is
a
good
brew
but
my
tastebuds
have
been
indoctrinated
by
hopsladen
american
pas
and
this
one
just
seems
weak
in
comparison
it
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
scant
white
head
lots
of
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
with
some
spicy
hops
in
the
background
fullers
signature
buttery
burnt
caramel
flavor
dominates
the
flavor
though
it
is
more
subdued
than
in
the
esb
spicy
and
slightly
herbal
hops
provide
nice
balance
but
never
dominate
the
flavor
a
malty
pa
by
american
standards
a
malt
lovers
beginner
pale
ale
the
taste
is
very
nice
highly
malted
sweet
and
mild
there
are
nice
floral
hops
that
help
to
clean
the
taste
up
toward
the
end
some
caramel
tastes
add
a
pleasant
taste
as
well
very
nice
beer
one
that
youd
not
have
a
hard
time
drinking
all
evening
awesome
beer
all
around
i
love
this
beer
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
need
to
taste
a
few
more
times
to
discern
the
difference
ill
definitely
pick
up
more
of
these
the
next
time
i
go
to
the
beer
store
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
wispy
lace
is
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
of
bread
and
grain
with
some
caramel
and
hops
in
the
backround
not
overpowering
but
very
inviting
very
smooth
with
flavors
of
toasted
bread
and
caarmel
upfront
hops
play
in
the
back
to
make
sure
this
stays
balanced
and
it
does
medium
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
wyll
you
know
when
something
just
feels
so
right
this
is
definitely
it
i
could
go
on
and
on
lets
just
say
world
classic
very
drinkable
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
date
on
back

very
drinkable
a
perfect
session
beer
wish
i
could
find
this
on
tap
this
review
will
be
updated
when
i
get
back
to
a
fresher
bottle
remember
what
ever
you
do

take
pride
thx
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
and
its
easy
drinking
this
is
a
nice
decent
drinkable
pale
ale
2
99
for
the
pint
bottle
on
buying
this
i
was
expecting
something
along
the
lines
of
the
easy
quaffing
and
similarly
priced
bombardier
bitter
but
it
is
something
else
entirely
pours
a
glorious
reddish
gold
colour
with
a
very
slight
head
the
taste
is
complex
but
likeable
and
builds
up
to
a
sharp
finish
with
a
really
nice
aftertaste
overall
am
very
impressed
is
a
beer
which
is
tasty
as
well
as
interesting
and
would
reward
further
exploration
if
it
didnt
cost
so
much
one
of
my
favourite
uk
pale
ales
im
not
sure
if
there
are
better
pale
ales
but
if
you
like
the
pale
alebitter
style
you
need
to
try
this
notes
im
still
an
american
ipa
lover
but
this
is
one
great
beer
a
very
presentable
interesting
yeasty

ale
awesome
english
pale
ale
could
definitely
handle
a
six
pack
happily
another
fantastic
beer
from
fullers
the
definition
of
session
this
is
choice
stuff
and
lots
more
sweet
malt
character
in
the
flavor
is
there
such
thing
as
a
malt
monster
this
is
so
far
from
gearys
pale
that
its
akin
to
being
another
planets
pale
ale
a
gordon
bierschlike
sweetness
tempered
by
pert
smallbubbled
carbonation
and
only
a
swipe
of
hops
bitterness
is
mostly
in
finish
and
aftertaste
mouth
is
very
round
and
full
i
love
the
smell
more
than
the
taste
london
pride
is
a
great
example
of
why
nose
should
be
part
of
every
beers
enjoyment
now
i
know
why
this
brewery
has
been
around
for
so
long
i
have
to
agree
with
vitesse
and
say
that
this
is
probably
the
most
balanced
beer
i
have
ever
had
a
crystal
clear
amber
tawny
color
the
only
bad
part
was
the
head
disappeared
too
quickly
for
me
but
certainly
the
taste
aroma
made
up
for
that
if
you
find
this
do
yourself
a
favor
and
buy
a
case
and
keep
it
soley
for
yourself
a
true
english
ale
that
wont
disappoint
very
drinkable
moderate
abv
and
a
great
beer
that
suits
any
season
highly
recommended
the
beer
poured
an
amberish
color
topped
by
a
1
inch
head
which
disappeared
quickly
a
very
soft
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
was
also
softwith
just
a
hint
of
malt
tried
and
triend
but
couldnt
detect
the
carmelly
sugar
daddy
taste
this
was
supposed
to
have
its
ok
but
couldnt
find
a
reason
to
recommend
it
the
beer
pours
a
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
head
disappated
quickly
and
there
was
no
lacing
there
was
a
medium
nose
of
hops
and
malts
taste
had
some
hints
of
caramel
to
it
fairly
good
presence
of
hops
and
malts
to
the
taste
definite
malt
finish
a
little
hoppier
in
the
finish
very
close
to
the
cask
version
but
just
a
hair
less
smooth
overall
pretty
good
rocky
white
head
takes
its
time
before
leaving
the
party
with
a
nice
sticky
lace
following
behind
beautiful
clear
copper
color
and
a
nice
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
a
little
sweet
grainy
malt
with
a
good
english
hop
aroma
and
a
little
yeast
taste
is
excellent
with
a
slight
roasty
character
in
the
front
followed
by
a
strong
malt
background
that
is
matched
perfectly
with
a
flavor
of
english
hops
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
body
is
in
the
medium
range
and
is
perfect
for
this
beer
this
beer
relaxes
me
just
by
taste
alone
after
a
long
day
a
london
pride
is
a
welcome
sight
excellent
english
pale
ale
though
it
is
hardly
pale
pours
a
nice
head
that
is
resilient
but
diminishes
quickly
and
has
a
sticky
lace
a
copper
color
and
a
lively
amount
of
co2
smell
is
like
cider
with
some
yeast
and
hops
thrown
in
taste
is
smooth
with
a
slight
bite
and
some
sweetness
in
the
background
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
yet
also
crisp
this
beer
has
an
exceptional
balance
of
flavors
for
a
pale
ale
quite
drinkable
another
proper
pint
and
another
textbook
beer
with
the
bar
set
way
up
a
little
subdued
but
relatively
solid
english
pale
clear
amber
in
color
with
a
decent
head
bouquet
is
yeasty
and
grainy
with
a
touch
of
hops
i
also
picked
up
some
fruit
mediumbodied
and
quite
smooth
fairly
malty
in
taste
with
the
tiniest
bit
of
fruit
ends
slightly
hoppy
all
around
a
pretty
good
brew
probably
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
ive
had
but
by
no
means
the
top
of
the
fullers
line
golden
brown
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
nice
malts
somewhat
hoppy
full
flavor
nice
body
mouthfeel
is
malty
and
round
good
hopmalt
balance
smooth
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
malty
and
bitter
nice
example
of
an
english
style
pale
ale
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
but
nothing
exciting
imho
if
i
never
had
esb
maybe
i
would
be
more
impressed
with
this
beer
certainly
a
good
all
around
pale
ale
and
i
know
its
not
really
fair
to
compare
it
to
a
beer
of
a
different
style
even
in
the
category
of
pale
ales
ive
had
better
its
just
too
thin
and
bland
for
the
style
i
admire
subtlety
but
this
may
be
a
bit
too
subtle
looks
and
smells
nice
tastes
good
goes
down
easy
i
followed
it
with
an
esb
and
the
difference
is
huge
for
the
same
money
ill
take
the
esb
every
time
overall
impression
i
like
this
one
i
passed
it
over
in
the
coolers
many
times
opting
for
an
old
friend
in
bass
ale
but
i
havent
neglected
the
pride
of
london
ever
since
trying
it
a
good
try
for
the
hopheads
its
not
as
bitter
as
an
ipa
but
the
hoppy
fragrance
instigates
the
ol
taste
buds
to
get
ready
the
beer
is
an
enchanting
golden
yellow
not
very
much
head
i
think
it
disappeared
before
i
could
see
it
bitter
and
buttery
aroma
rather
nice
buttery
and
bitter
taste
as
well
feels
nice
too
its
a
good
beer
ill
enjoy
this
and
would
like
another
sometime
but
theres
not
enough
complexitydifference
to
set
this
one
apart
when
this
beer
was
poured
it
had
a
tan
head
with
smallmedium
bubbles
this
beer
has
a
sweet
and
fruity
aroma
reminding
me
of
apples
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
to
it
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
smooth
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
truly
enjoyed
drinking
and
rating
now
this
is
how
its
done
the
outstanding
on
the
label
is
well
earned
came
in
a
sturdy
brown
500ml
bottle
with
the
freshness
date
stamped
on
the
back
label
pours
out
a
beautiful
coppery
tone
it
damn
near
made
me
weep
not
much
head
but
it
rings
the
glass
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
rich
buttery
bread
sweet
malt
and
caramel
a
bit
of
toffee
and
a
faint
hint
of
mild
hops
flavour
is
smooth
and
well
blended
buttery
toffee
taste
toasted
malt
and
nice
compliment
of
hops
towards
the
end
it
goes
down
like
liquid
heaven
this
would
make
an
amazing
sessional
a
pity
i
only
have
the
one
bottle
this
is
an
ale
to
be
proud
of
indeed
this
brew
has
a
mild
malty
aroma
when
poured
yields
a
light
brown
lively
head
full
of
medium
to
small
bubbles
its
body
is
a
nice
clear
dark
transparent
copper
color
it
had
a
very
nice
light
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
very
smooth
and
well
rounded
flavor
after
finishing
a
bottle
of
fullers
esb
i
decided
to
try
the
pale
the
characteristics
of
this
ale
are
similar
to
the
esb
but
not
as
intense
appearnce
is
similar
clear
amber
with
a
head
slightly
less
than
the
esb
but
yielding
better
retention
aroma
is
hoppy
and
sweet
but
not
overpowering
palate
is
lighter
and
flavor
also
lighter
this
is
an
esb
light
in
my
opinion
and
not
outstanding
as
its
label
states
session
beer
hmmm
i
think
the
esb
would
make
a
better
session
beer
and
i
know
this
from
spending
hours
throwing
darts
and
throwing
down
hand
pulled
pints
at
churchills
olde
english
tavern
also
had
an
unassumingly
long
finish
as
it
quietly
came
back
to
remind
me
with
soft
dryness
and
lemon
flavor
great
mouthfeel
watery
with
a
just
right
amount
of
body
and
texture
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
totally
a
session
styled
pale
as
brits
would
do
in
contrast
with
american
strong
bittered
versions
pat
a
nice
dark
amber
color
ale
with
a
lacy
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
is
quite
malty
which
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
it
would
taste
that
way
as
well
lots
of
nice
malt
flavors
backed
by
a
slight
bite
of
hops
some
buttery
flavors
in
there
as
well
if
this
is
only
4
7
its
a
shame
that
its
not
cheap
enough
to
be
sold
in
cases
cause
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
great
english
pale
ale
this
could
be
calling
your
name
had
this
beer
in
a
tall
thin
bottle
poured
into
a
fullers
nonick
pint
glass
the
pour
left
a
very
large
head
for
an
average
english
pale
about
2
53
fingers
worth
the
color
was
dark
gold
there
was
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
down
the
side
of
the
glass
taste
is
only
slightly
hoppy
and
very
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
soft
but
not
bad
this
is
a
very
light
pale
with
a
fantastic
long
finish
which
i
love
also
very
drinkable
so
have
a
few
this
exists
solidly
between
their
esb
and
ipa
and
thats
ok
quite
carbonated
with
the
bottle
erupting
when
the
top
came
off
poured
a
nice
copperorange
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
fruity
hops
and
biscuits
came
across
in
the
aroma
profile
grainy
biscuity
flavors
were
percieved
along
with
a
noticeable
diacetyl
flavor
hints
of
caramel
came
and
went
moderate
hop
bitterness
lingered
on
the
tongue
but
did
not
overpower
the
malt
profile
quite
nice
indeed
an
exceptional
ale
in
every
respect
the
glass
revealed
a
crystal
clear
amber
brew
with
a
rather
thin
ivory
head
relatively
light
lacing
from
the
too
brief
head
nose
of
malt
and
hops
delicate
flavor
of
malts
and
decent
hopping
to
create
a
very
straightfoward
and
enjoyable
beer
hints
of
caramel
and
bread
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
a
nice
body
sense
with
a
buttery
mouthfeel
complete
the
presentation
highly
recommended
bottom
line
a
quintessential
british
mild
ale
perfect
for
quaffing
poured
a
clear
amber
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
retreated
to
the
side
of
the
glass
floral
hops
and
malt
nose
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
flavors
consists
of
caramel
sweet
malt
and
hops
the
hop
bitterness
provides
a
good
balance
to
the
malt
sweetness
and
takes
over
in
the
finish
definitely
a
solid
pale
ale
color
is
a
glowing
amber
with
a
small
tannish
head
about
a
finger
high
and
has
good
frothyness
smell
is
floral
hops
with
a
honeynut
malt
background
taste
is
very
crisp
sharp
and
clean
with
big
time
freshbittering
floral
hops
and
has
a
caramelnutty
malt
balanced
in
the
feel
is
very
light
and
somewhat
lightly
silkyoily
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
fits
the
style
this
beer
is
made
for
drinkin
and
drinkin
alot
goes
down
easy
with
a
well
balanced
bitter
bite
and
smooth
malt
backing
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
this
one
it
was
a
good
pale
ale
but
it
didnt
knock
me
over
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
light
bubbly
head
minimal
lacing
was
left
aromas
were
of
floral
hops
and
mild
citrus
peel
the
taste
packed
a
big
punch
of
floral
hops
and
malted
barley
there
was
a
slightly
bitter
and
astringent
taste
left
in
my
mouth
allinall
is
was
a
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
given
the
opportunity
i
would
drink
this
one
again
its
a
light
copper
color
very
clear
also
a
medium
head
forms
and
has
a
short
duration
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
all
5s
a
slight
film
is
all
i
had
for
most
of
the
glass
and
no
lacing
mellow
and
calming
effects
please
the
nasal
passages
with
sweet
malts
and
just
a
smidgeon
of
happy
hops
i
am
stunned
at
how
smooth
and
drinkable
this
beer
is
every
sip
becomes
larger
and
larger
as
i
try
to
have
as
much
of
this
luscious
fluid
touch
my
tastebuds
there
is
no
biting
hops
bitterness
a
more
mellow
hop
character
is
preceded
by
a
lightly
carbonated
and
very
wonderful
maltiness
i
am
most
definitely
a
big
fan
of
fullers
now
after
loving
the
london
porter
and
1845
and
now
this
pale
ale
that
is
well
worthy
the
london
pride
moniker
my
favorite
beer
out
of
england
so
far
was
not
impressed
ar
first
but
it
quicky
improved
overall
impression
great
beer
theres
a
reason
this
is
a
hallmark
of
the
style
ive
had
too
many
english
style
pale
ales
that
have
rancid
or
harsh
buttery
notes
but
this
is
smooth
and
has
more
of
a
meadbutterscotch
flavor
which
is
very
enjoyable
a
wonderful
session
beer
a
sublime
textbook
balancing
act
this
beer
doesnt
rely
on
brawn
and
gusto
to
impress
the
best
english
pale
ale
ive
had
well
done
ill
be
buying
this
again
this
was
a
nicely
balanced
pale
ale
however
it
was
just
too
mild
overall
it
wasnt
bland
but
it
wasnt
exciting
either
pours
a
moderately
hazy
dark
golden
amber
color
that
resembles
a
browning
peach
topped
off
with
a
nice
cake
of
beige
foam
that
reduces
quickly
to
a
thin
film
complex
nose
is
characterized
by
caramely
malts
with
a
whiff
of
hops
taste
reminds
me
of
a
scotch
ale
with
a
sweet
syrupy
finish
that
fades
into
a
more
bitter
dry
aftertaste
relatively
crisp
and
even
a
bit
watery
at
the
front
more
clingy
than
crisp
and
clean
this
nonetheless
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
more
than
adequately
drinkable
handpulled
and
boy
what
a
difference
it
makes
this
blows
any
other
fullers
beer
ive
tried
out
of
the
water
tons
of
flavor
creamy
nutty
a
huge
beer
flavorwise
but
remains
incredibly
easy
to
drink
head
leaves
perfect
rings
down
the
glass
and
the
beer
massages
the
inside
of
my
throat
on
the
way
down
generous
malt
presence
initially
sweet
up
front
but
said
sweetness
makes
ample
room
for
assertive
hops
and
a
perfectly
dry
finish
the
aftertaste
toys
with
me
teasing
beckoning
me
to
partake
in
more
i
happily
obey
its
an
experience
like
this
that
makes
beers
like
bass
and
boddingtons
seem
especially
dull
the
bartender
told
me
that
most
customers
dont
like
the
caskconditioned
beers
and
instead
opt
for
heineken
corona
amstel
light
idiots
more
for
me
i
guess
pours
a
nice
copper
with
nearly
white
head
aroma
hints
at
a
bit
more
hop
with
a
slightly
floral
character
little
hop
flavor
this
beer
relies
on
malts
to
get
the
job
done
slightly
sweet
the
predominant
flavor
is
biscuity
malt
with
a
healthy
dose
of
buttery
diacytel
low
abv
means
you
can
put
away
quite
a
few
of
these
which
is
a
good
thing
the
put
away
a
few
not
the
low
abv
i
prefer
a
bit
more
bite
flavor
picked
up
quite
a
bit
as
it
warmed
a
bright
clear
copperamber
body
is
topped
by
a
large
frothy
foamy
white
head
which
leaves
behind
an
outstanding
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
herbal
and
floral
hops
with
a
whiff
of
fine
british
sulfur
taste
is
caramel
and
butterscotch
with
a
subtle
but
definite
hop
presence
balancing
the
sweetness
in
fine
fashion
mouthfeel
is
round
and
full
a
fine
ale
to
while
away
the
hours
in
the
pub
calling
your
beer
outstanding
on
the
label
might
be
immodest
but
all
of
london
should
have
pride
in
this
brew
pale
orangeamber
color
crystal
clear
with
a
sudsy
white
head
that
stays
well
floral
slightly
spicy
and
oily
english
hops
in
the
nose
along
with
toastedgrainy
malt
very
pleasing
taste
not
too
overwhelming
but
definitely
not
lacking
in
flavor
or
body
english
hop
bitterness
and
toastedbreadygrainy
malt
are
matched
perfectly
to
create
what
is
probably
the
finest
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
you
can
find
at
the
very
front
sweet
malt
makes
up
most
of
the
flavor
profile
but
in
the
middle
the
hops
really
take
hold
the
finish
is
more
of
a
balance
between
the
two
leafy
hop
character
in
the
aftertaste
a
musttry
as
i
was
saying
the
best
english
pale
ale
ive
ever
tasted
quite
a
high
level
of
carbination
which
keeps
the
head
perky
throughout
the
tasting
pours
with
a
big
rocky
head
before
dispating
with
considerable
lacing
something
that
is
consistent
around
the

this

of

it

i
could

see

this
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
i
have
ever
had
the
pale
malt
with
hop
bitterness
is
the
perfect
combination
a
very
nice
clean
finish
is
the
perfect
ending
to
a
perfect
pale

very
competent
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
distinctly
bitter
hops
aroma
biting
hops
flavor
with
little
malt
to
counteract
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
it
did
seem
slightly
unbalanced
though
id
like
to
try
this
on
draught
some
day
overall
though
this
is
another
winner
from
fullers
read
all
the
hype
had
to
try
the
beer
i
liked
the
bottle
both
the
shape
and
the
label
poured
a
nice
amber
color
the
taste
to
me
was
rather
flat
it
tasted
like
a
good
ale
but
not
spectacular
perhaps
on
tap
it
would
be
better
would
drink
it
again
but
it
is
a
little
too
pricey
pours
a
nice
bright
copper
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
slowly
sinks
nicely
bitter
hop
aroma
with
enough
malty
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
smooth
with
a
nice
malty
start
to
it
light
diacetyl
from
start
to
middle
and
then
in
the
finish
lightly
quite
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
especially
for
the
style
much
more
bitter
that
i
expected
nice
lingering
bitter
finish
makes
this
brew
much
crisper
than
i
was
expecting
and
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
with
its
medium
body
this
would
make
a
rather
nice
drink
in
the
summer
time
and
i
wish
that
i
had
discovered
it
then
nice
clear
golden
amber
color
was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
everything
after
that
was
down
hill
the
smell
was
not
much
to
brag
about
and
the
taste
was
just
of
another
average
pale
ale
nothing
exceptional
with
this
beer
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
and
smooth
no
nothing
flavor
a
clear
deep
amber
delight
the
head
is
creamy
light
beige
the
lace
in
clinging
sheets
nose
is
malt
the
top
is
light
and
the
finish
is
corporeally
hopped
pleasantly
dry
leniently
carbonated
fullers
is
one
of
my
top
ten
all
time
favorite
breweries
an
excellent
pale
ale
each
pull
urges
you
to
take
another
at
the
end
of
one
glass
youll
start
looking
around
for
the
next
an
excellent
session
beer
ive
had
it
on
cask
at
the
brewery
and
at
a
couple
of
other
pubs
in
london
from
what
i
can
judge
it
has
to
be
well
kept
otherwise
you
can
forget
it
as
with
most
cask
ales
well
kept
it
is
wonderfully
aromatic
resiny
hoppy
bitter
citrusy
there
was
a
pub
in
richmond
in
london
that
totally
kicked
arse
and
served
it
better
than
the
brewery
did
i
cant
remember
the
name
of
the
pub
but
i
often
dream
about
that
pint
my
rating
is
based
on
that
pint
brilliant
amber
color
full
head
fell
to
a
thin
ring
of
white
foam
flavor
is
malty
with
soft
hop
notes
throughout
slight
esters
contribute
delicious
buttery
and
sweet
ale
flavors
that
mix
well
with
the
malt
and
hops
creating
a
slightly
sweet
and
aromatic
finish
i
can
discern
the
character
that
some
brewers
in
the
us
are
trying
to
capture
i
like
this
beer
i
will
buy
this
if
i
cant
get
my
favorite
domestic
english
pale
ale
see
my
reviews
i
dont
want
to
sound
like
a
paid
shill
anymore
amber
in
color
with
decent
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
on
the
malt
with
faint
hop
undertones
the
taste
was
excellent
when
the
hops
shone
through
the
full
longlasting
flavor
was
big
in
the
mouthfeel
department
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
excellent
english
style
pale
ale
this
pale
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
from
the
bottle
with
a
sizeable
offwhite
head
which
looks
great
there
is
a
faint
hops
smell
the
taste
is
somewhat
biscuitlike
with
heavy
malt
notes
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
creamy
and
malty
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
great
example
of
an
epa
this
is
a
real
winner
on
draught
it
has
a
healthy
white
head
and
a
pleasant
smell
that
is
subtle
hops
and
malt
the
taste
is
also
a
nice
balance
of
slightly
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
hops
it
goes
down
like
silk
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
goes
well
with
many
meals
not
the
least
of
which
is
a
genuine
plate
of
fish
and
chips
notes
indeed
this
brew
goes
down
as
one
of
the
greatest
bliss
in
a
bottle
btw
this
is
fullers
flagship
brew
a
true
aledrinkers
ale
up
there
in
greatness
with
the
esb
also
an
interesting
pale
reminded
me
alot
of
bass
but
without
that
metallic
taste
bass
is
known
for
fullers
puts
out
some
fine
beers
and
this
is
quite
good
as
well
pours
out
to
a
goldenamber
color
with
a
light
aroma
slight
hop
taste
that
is
in
no
way
overwhelming
with
a
slight
taste
of
caramel

easy

drink

you
to

very
easy
to
drink
to
the
point
you
feel
guilty
putting
your
glass
down
a
real
treat
on
tap
a
great
beer
and
perfect
example
of
the
style
magic
in
a
glass
a
fine
example
of
what
english
pales
should
aspire
to
be
it
drinks
hearty
and
tastey
and
is
a
good
looker
dig
it
dig
again
cheers
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
any
of
fulers
beers
i
have
tried
they
are
all
very
good
this
pale
ale
is
a
little
on
the
dark
side
imo
for
the
style
not
much
aroma
here
and
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
to
it
taste
more
on
the
malty
side
than
the
hoppy
i
think
a
little
more
hops
would
enhance
this
beer
overall
i
will
gladly
drink
this
brew
again
cheers

pretty
good
taste
nice

good
earthy

from

and
a
nice

this
beer
gets
better
as
you
work
your
way
through
it
i
tend
to
prefer
american
style
pale
ales
more
than
the
english
counterpart
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
english
versions
ive
come
across
fullers
is
really
good
with
malts
im
not
sure
if
they
malt
their
own
but
if
they
dont
they
sure
know
how
to
buy
them
the
malt
flavors
are
complex
in
and
of
themselves
thats
good
because
its
really
light
on
hops
on
tap
anyway
and
the
malt
has
to
carry
it
its
not
an
ipa
or
a
bitter
so
its
not
supposed
to
be
really
hoppy
this
is
a
really
good
meal
to
go
with
a
meal
it
really
went
well
with
the
shepherds
pie
i
had
fine
clear
deeper
amber

approaching
copper
nice
34

on

like
candied
lemon
great
lowcarbonation
body
malty
sweet
with
a
touch
of

very
much
of
the
english
style
but
far
more
flavorful
than
a
bass
mediumbodied
and
satisfying
and
highly
drinkable
i
prefer
the
hoppier
american
pales

this
is

again
copper

mild

malt
notes

the
carbonation
at
least
in
this
bottle
is
too
high
and
results
in
a
soda
like
prickly
mouthfeel
hop
flavor
is
grassy
and
distinctively
british
hop
bitterness
is
crisp
and
assertive
considering
the
lack
of

the
subdued

flavors
are
comprised
of
bready
and
generic
caramal
malt
notes
london
pride
finishes
dry
and
a

toasty
its
a
good
pale
but
malt
flavors
were
lacking
imo
i
could
still
drink
a
lot
of
these
fat
lace
clings
to
glass
above
a
copper
liquid
nirvana
rich
bready
fruity
nose
drink
in
a
deep
malt
start
that
turns
instantly
bitter
and
lingers
enough
to
beckon
you
to
taste
again
smooth
and
appropriate
for
a
session
or
a
treat
a
standard
that
any
brewer
going
for
the
english
pale
should
reckon
worth
the
outlay
an
excellent
all
around
drinking
beer
a
totally
soothing
smooth
malty
ale
the
bottled
version
we
get
here
is
just
a
tease
having
this
cask
conditioned
in
the
u
k
is
really
where
its
at
maltier
almost
caramel
taste
is
the
base
smooth
mellow
hops
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
rounds
out
this
top
ale
one
of
the
keepers
a
good
solid
choice
and
a
nice
benchmark
for
the
classic
pale
ale
style
malty
firm
crisp
with
a
nice
soft
character
you
cant
got
wrong
with
this
beer
this
is
a
classic
english
pale
rather
mild
malt
with
a
gentle
hop
flavor
and
aroma
firm
body
and
a
steady
finish
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
associate
with
the
name
english
ale
perhaps
the
best
real
ale
around
anything
less
is
a
disappointment
very
nicetasty
and
super
drinkable
almost
to
a
fault
sweet
but
not
too
much
fullbody
taste
for
a
light
beer
overall
enjoying
the
tender
taste
and
unique
feel
ok
could
be
a
lot
better
sweet
but
thin
relatively
mild
and
plain
tasting
never
minda
well
made
epa
with
the
honey
adder
overall
refreshing
different
and
easy
to
drink
was
expecting
more
of
a
honey
taste
but
the
sweetnessbitterness
combination
is
good
i
could
chug
this
all
night
nice
moderate
carbonation
overalli
like
sweet
beer
so
i
was
a
fan
the
honey
flavor
was
stronger
than
other
beers
with
honey
i
have
had
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
an
english
pub
glass

dark
lemon
drop

with
quickbreaking

and
a
rather
sweet
buttered

spread

aroma

of
the
same
on
the
palate
buttered
biscuit
and
lightly
honeyed
breakfast
cereal
subtle
citrus
lemon
and
orange
and
gooseberryvinous
fruit
notes
nothing
overly
bold
or
assertive
yet
not
bland
either
carbonation
is
lowkey
although
the
beer
is
not
flat
with
more
mouthfeel
than
expected
and
a
lingering
doughy
sweetness
that
carries
through
into
the
slightly
chalky
finish
where
some
lightly
floral
hops
again
make
their
presence
known
although
there
are
no
obvious
flaws
and
the
expected
taste
elements
are
there
i
am
struggling
a
little
with
the
pedestrian
and
unassuming
demeanor
of
this
brew
whats
there
holds
promise
but
one
is
left
wanting
more
o
sweet
beer
no
pun
intended
i
thought
id
had
this
one
but
i
am
enjoying
it
more
than
i
remember
clear
honey
qualities
and
a
light
sweetness
makes
it
pleasant
bought
in
bangkok
at

in

march

2015
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
honey
makes
things
a
bit
more
interesting
and
prevents
this
from
being
a
band
pale
ale
totally
recommended
nice
honey
flavour
sweet
mild
slightly
bitter
and
tart
aftertaste
easy
drinking
and
even
flavours
but
overly
carbonated
overall
basically
a
floral
pilsner
with
a
bit
more
body
missing
some
taste
at
start
the
honey
incorporation
is
very
light
and
subtle
kinda
works
but
could

be
a

more

euch
i
really
dont
understand
honey
beers
most
of
them
just
taste
like
this
one
a
pretty
ordinary
beer
that
tastes
like
it
has
had
warmed
honey
poured
into
it
pretty
awful
stuff
at
least
this
ordinary
stuff
would
only
be

x
330ml
bottles
seriously
fullers
i
really
like
it
not
as
machoproof
but
as
everyday
feel
good
beer
o
i
expected
more
from
this
one
it
looked
really
good
but
let
down
on
the
smell
and
i
found
the
flavor
not
really
that
interesting
it
was
a
light
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
really
no
major
flaws
but
overall
this
was
just
okay
and
nothing
special
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
really
seek
it
out
pours
to
a
nice
white
thin
head
that
stays
around
with
no
lacing
color
is
a
rich
gold
with
some
floaties
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
with
apple
pear
and
white
grapes
and
some
grainy
malt
flavor
is
grainy
fruity
and
crisp
not
as
sweet
as
nose
would
suggest
but
actually
quite
sharp
and
balanced
yet
no
distinct
hop
character
of
any
kind
weird
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
ciderlike
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
although
it
is
more
like
some
of
my
nicer
homebrewed
blonde
honey
ales
than
any
sort
of
epa
as
a
beer
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
this
to
be
sunny
yellowgolden
in
color
clear
with
a
bit
of
a
glow
and
wispy
foam
the
essence
of
honey
more
or
less
defines
the
aromas
and
flavors
some
toasty
pale
malt
certainly
factors
in
there
as
well
mostly
in
the
aftertaste
a
touch
of
light
sweetness
up
front
though
this
all
but
disappears
into
a
delicately
bitterfloral
dry
finish
damn
soft
on
the
palate
quiet
all
in
all
not
terribly
complex
but
delectable
and
drinkable
for
what
it
is
probably
would
go
well
with
a
creamy
flan
or
pudding
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
honey
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
love
the
taste
love
the
look
summertime
in
a
glass
as
one
hammersmith
bartender
memorably
told
me
luckily
this
ale
is
being
widely
promoted
in
hong
kong
so
there
are
many
more
places
it
can
be
found
and
its
the
least
expensive
fullers
bottle
available
here
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
well
balanced
and
packed
with
refreshing
hops
excellent
drinkability
i
could
be
drinking
this
all
day
long
an
english
drinking
ale
for
certain
has
an
easy
drinking
quality
i
surprised
its
5
as
it
drinks
and
feels
smaller
than
that
richness
and
fullness
of
flavors
start
to
open
up
as
it
warms
not
a
knockout
but
ill
never
pass
something
from
this
brewery
an
ok
honey
beer
though
nothing
special
quite
light
in
aroma
and
flavour
though
the
honey
comes
through
would
probably
be
alright
on
a
hot
day
but
frankly
theres
not
enough
going
on
to
hold
my
attention
worth
trying
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
overall
another
success
from
fullers
flavour
is
spot
on
great
mouthfeel
fantastic
summer
brew
pours
a
clear
amber
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
clearly
of
fresh
honey
slight
pale
malt
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
english
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
honey
pale
malt
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
discerned
the
distinct
flavor
of
honey
in
a
beer
brewed
with
honey
that
alone
would
be
enough
for
me
to
give
this
a
high
rating
also
good
appearance
and
feel
o
the
honey
aspect
is
definitely
raw
and
natural
and
although
the
result
tastes
a
little
odd
it
is
easy
drinking
and
worth
a
try
overall
i
must
say
i
wasnt
that
impressed
with
the
first
one
nor
the
second
but
somehow
this
one
grows
on
me
especially
when
hot
and
very
thirsty
this
is
an
insanely
satisfying
drink
if
you
want
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
good
complex
beer
this
is
definitely
not
the
one
but
if
youre
thirsty
and
just
want
something
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
o
id
buy
more
of
this
if
it
was
made
locally
but
for
the
price
there
are
other
honey
browns
and
similar
that
i
prefer
final
grade
3
7
an
acceptable
b
grade
fullers
organic
honeydew
is
probably
the
best
organic
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
thats
really
not
saying
much
in
fact
to
be
a
bit
blunt
i
could
just
as
easily
have
said
that
its
the
weakest
brew
from
fullers
i
have
yet
tried
that
being
said
its
still
well
above
average
and
it
makes
for
an
enjoyable
pint
worth
a
try
i
suppose
but
in
the
future
ill
probably
just
stick
to
london
pride
this
is
quite
a
good
representation
and
is
both
drinkable
and
flavourful
could
be
better
on
the
finish
and
maybe
a
couple
off
notes
probably
due
to
staleness
but
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
a
decent
brew
from
fullers
that
is
perfect
for
summer
honey
dew
the
bottle
says
this
award
winning
beer
delightfully
tasty
golden
and
refreshing
is
the
u
k
s
leading
organically
produced
ale
brewed
using
carefully
chosen
ingredients
organic
english
malt
organic
hops
and
the
finest
organic
honey
together
with
our
unique
yeast
and
water
honey
dew
has
a
mellow
rounded
character
deliciously
balanced
with
a
zesty
citrus
finish
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
have
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
so
it
rather
appeals
to
me
i
could
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
this
brew
pours
out
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
drops
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
a
very
realistic
honey
note
dominating
the
proceedings
along
with
some
lightly
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
excellent
its
got
the
sweet
honey
tastes
at
first
but
it
fades
to
an
absolutely
sublime
lightly
toasted
malt
helped
out
by
just
a
touch
of
honey
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
quaffable
overall
its
a
great
summer
ale
that
i
wish
came
in
six
packs
o
i
am
hooked
on
this
ale
highly
recommend
it
to
be
tried
at
least
once
preferably
cold
on
a
warmer
day
relatively
pricey
compared
to
u
s
domestic
beers
but
as
the
old
saying
goes
you
get
what
you
pay
for
in
this
case
it
is
an
amazing
ale
a
good
average
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
golden
ale
with
a
foamy
head
that
has
lots
of
retention
the
color
reminds
me
of
mead
or
maybe
i
just
think
that
because
i
know
theres
honey
in
it
aromas
of
sweet
cereal
and
fruits
honey
is
present
and
isnt
overpowering
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
bit
of
mead
as
well
tart
fruity
candy
with
a
touch
of
honey
grains
are
present
as
well
its
crisp
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
this
is
a
really
lovely
ale
pretty
far
from
some
of
the
better
fullers
products
ive
tried
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
honey
d
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
and
a
good
alternative
to
a
boring
lager
not
an
exceptional
beer
overall
but
a
tasty
one
regardless
nothing
ill
go
looking
for
again
in
the
future
though
o
crisp
fun
and
refreshing
id
love
to
try
this
again
on
a
nice
summer
day
od
meh
not
special
but
certainly
not
offensive
sessionable
for
sure
if
it
had
more
flavour
aside
from
the
honey
note
no
hops
and
little
malty
goodness
to
speak
of
but
the
honey
note
is
alright
weak
for
fullers
but
i
can
see
their
target
market
here
o
this
is
a
very
nice
english
pale
ale
a
nice
sessionable
brew
from
fullers
overall
an
english
pale
ale
that
would
certainly
lend
itself
to
summer
drinking
served
at
a
slightly
lower
temperature
than
normal
for
english
ales
as
per
the
back
of
the
bottle
this
would
be
quite
refreshing
as
a
warm
wealther
quaffing
beer
yet
theres
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
not
a
ton
of
depth
but
its
a
solid
english
pale
ale
and
its
certainly
the
best
honey
beer
ive
ever
had
the
presence
of
honey
is
easily
discernable
both
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
but
its
not
overly
sweet
or
artificial
tasting
this
would
likely
be
a
solid
b
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
its
4
00
a
bottle
for
what
it
is
thats
just
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
pours
a
very
vibrant
blonde
with
an
intense
white
foam
head
which
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
atop
the
brew
decent
lacing
smells
very
pleasant
earthy
hops
malt
honey
sweetness
taste
is
also
very
nice
honey
sweet
with
a
present
malt
backbone
slight
floralhoney
aftertaste
which
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
without
a
problem
overall
needs
more
flavor
just
comes
off
as
lacking
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
i
usually
like
what
fullers
does
and
ended
up
being
happily
surprised
its
a
nicely
sweet
beer
with
just
enough
citrus
hops
to
keep
it
away
from
being
too
sweet
the
honey
comes
through
in
the
taste
and
also
lightens
the
body
it
would
be
cool
to
see
this
on
draft
somewhere
in
the
twin
cities
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
very
refreshing
lagerlike
qualities
as
an
alternative
to
a
pale
lager
this
would
be
high
on
my
list
its
smooth
and
malty
without
having
any
overbearing
features
and
having
any
off
flavours
organic
honeydew
is
yet
another
in
a
long
line
of
easily
enjoyed
fullers
beers
while
its
undoubtedly
an
average
sort
of
offering
its
a
proper
example
of
what
an
average
sort
of
offering
aught
to
taste
and
drink
like
few
breweries
as
large
as
fullers
can
keep
up
this
level
of
quality
especially
with
regards
to
their
more
mainstreamminded
offerings
o
an
ok
beer
it
beats
wells
honey
beer
but
isnt
spectacular
i
honestly
expect
much
more
from
fullers
whose
brews
are
normally
fantastic
o
ok
overall
this
was
a
tasty
beer
it
got
a
little
sweet
but
i
could
go
for
it
again
very
average
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
transient
white
head
some
bigger
bubbles
fall
to
a
thin
film
and
a
collar
remains
nose
has
some
sweet
honey
grainy
bread
and
only
a
hint
of
the
honey
dew
taste
reflects
the
nose
substantially
honey
sweetness
and
some
grain
the
honey
dew
melon
only
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
lingers
on
the
palate
after
the
fact
some
alcohol
is
detectable
which
isnt
too
desirable
for
this
abv
medium
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
good
for
what
it
is
but
far
from
spectacular
up
to
the
fullers
standard
and
a
good
organic
in
general
nice
summer
beer
and
a
great
meal
compliment
but
too
sweet
as
a
session
ale
for
my
taste
very
tasty
stuff
a
definite
cut

of

up

with

in
the
finish
bitter
as
well
but
remains
throughout
light
to
medium
carbonation
creamy
medium
to
full

good
weight
and
very
nice
on
the
palate
not
bad
approachable

solid
and
would
revisit
from
time
to
time
taste
buttered
toast
and
honey
predominate
with
bit
of
spicy

for
balance
finishes
very
clean
o
lovely
beer
to
try
but
not
again
maybe
not
in
the
near
future
missable
beer
the
honey
would
make
it
a
bit
too
much
to
have
a
few
of
these
but
a
single
feels
about
right
deep
shiny
gold
in
colour
tight
white
head
settles
to
a
thin
cap
leaving
little

balanced
and
quite
crisp

very
little

while
the

is
quite

it
delivers
on
the

its

fairly

from
the

im
not
getting
a

of

nice
bitterness
in
the

very
smooth

quite
a
nice
english
ale
overall
tastes
like
a

of
that
bitohoney
candy
honey
dew
is
amply
honeytasting
without
being
overly
sweet
simple
but
satisfying
and
refreshing
if
the
price
were
just
a
skosh
less
id
consider
stocking
up
on
it
had
a
pint
at
the
anchor
and
crown
in
monterey
ca
i
will
say
for
a
honey
beer
this
has
a
nice
distinct
clover
honey
aroma
and
flavor
that
doesnt
overpower
or
oversweeten
the
beer
theres
still
a
mild
pale
ale
in
the
background
with
a
little
grassy
lemon
hops
and
bready
malt
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
summer
from
the

the
pour
is
a
cloudy
pale
yelloworange
honey
is
easily
noted
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
grainy
and
malty
sweetness
the
body
is
light
but
also
rather
smooth
and
creamy
fresh
honey
comes
up
in
the
taste
in
a
likeable
way
with
a
thin
hoppy
ending
the
sweet
overtakes
the
hops
all
told
bbd
20110301
i
had
it
on
20110319
19
days
after
bb
date
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
again
but
the
smell
was
spot
on
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
overall
i
like
that
it
doesnt
try
to
put
a
bunch
of
hops
in
there
to
compete
and
muddle
up
the
honey
it
showcases
the
honey
pretty
well
so
for
what
it
is
it
really
isnt
that
bad
of
a
beer
that
said
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
more
boozy
or
something
like
it
had
mead
mixed
with
it
as
it
is
it
is
kinda
a
sweet
girlie
beer
which
is
ok
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
coming
back
to
d
no
dm
good
weight
and
slight
carbonation
full
balanced
flavor
that
pairs
very
well
with
dessert
d
tasty
but
a
little
bit
too
sweet
not
the
most
drinkable
english
pale
ale
around
overall
this
beer
is
alright
is
has
a
few
good
features
in
the
taste
but
it
lacks
a
kick
still
its
light
and
refreshing
worth
a
try
if
your
into
honey
beers
medium
body
good
carbonation
but
not
very
helpful
in
drinkabliity
run
of
the
mill
sweeter
pale
ale
nothing
worth
going
back
to
ok
with
food
but
not
a
sipper
on
its
own
pretty
clean
slightly
sweet
taste
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
and
what
it
is
aiming
for
one
of
the
nicer
honey
beers
ive
had
not
cloying
at
all
nothing
complex
but
i
would
strongly
suspect
thats
what
they
were
going
for
d
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
honey
in
the
taste
but
overall
it
was
pretty
good
the
label
says
refreshing
golden
beer
and
the
refreshing
part
is
very
true
the
light
watery
feeling
body
would
really
cool
you
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
this
brew
is
ok
a
nice
change
and
a
nice
summer
refresher
the
honey
gets
a
bit
sweet
as
you
drink
and
gets
a
bit
overwhelming
but
this
could
still
be
alright
for
a
pint
or
two
its
different
and
worth
a
try
just
for
the
experience
verdict
im
really
torn
on
whether
this
beer
has
gone
out
like
a
dud
or
whether
my
palate
just
needs
some
refining
obviously
the
honey
content
is
easily
distinguishable
in
this
beer
and
no
flavors
are
too
bold
to
repel
and
lighthearted
beer
drinkers
out
there
get
it
as
far
away
from
the
bbd
as
you
can
and
just
consider
the
style
of
the
beer
as
you
drink
it
nice

drink
not
a
spectacular
beer
by
any
means
but
one
that
warrants
trying
the
honey
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
and
i
can
see
how
this
beer
would
work
well
in
the
summer
months
this

its
about
a
year
and
2
months
off
to
be
precise
storage
conditions
were
not
fantastic
also
admittedly
so
i
will
have
to
cut
this
one
some
slack
here
d
very
drinkable
balanced
and
light
taste
very
sessionable
beer
pint

looks
like
a

ie

pale
clear
with
bubbles
no
head
cant
escape
the
honey
taste
quite
sweet
wheaty
aftertaste
has
a
bit
off
fiz
it
reminds
me
of
a
kristalweizen
of
all
the
fullers
ive
had
until
now
i
think
this
is
the
best
to
session
especially
as
its
organic
drinkability
the
honey
really
jumps
out
in
this
one
it
almost
tastes
like
a
sweet
pilsner
not
an
overly
complex
brew
but
very
sessionable
great
for
a
warm
day
a
typical
golden
brown
look
for
a
honey
lager
doesnt
try
to
put
anything
past
you
with
a
nice
light
refreshing
honeysweet
aftertaste
this
delicious
import
isnt
necessarily
anything
to
write
home
about
but
is
a
perfect
accompaniment
for
a
slice
of
pizza
while
playing
poker
a
full
flavoured
beer
with
a
good
body
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
fullers
organic
honeydew
has
its
merits
although
a
halfliter
of
it
is
plenty
now
lets
see
if
golden
pride
ever
hits
the
us
shore
the
sweetness
from
the
nose
dries
out
on
the
tastebuds
and
most
of
the
flavor
comes
from
a
nice
grainy
malt
presence
and
the
signature
yeast
a
notable
grassy
hop
presence
makes
this
beer
quite
refreshing
mild
honey
notes
float
in
on
the
aftertaste
feels
good
on
the
palate
nicely
carbonated
and
does
not
come
across
as
thin
despite
being
on
the
lighter
side
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
this
brew
as
an
impulse
buy
hell
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
another
one
sometime
soon
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
yes
i
know
thats
too
cold
the
beer
had
no
head
and
what
little
there
was
dissipated
fast
the
beer
really
did
not
have
a
heavy
honey
taste
but
was
more
rich
tasting
than
most
beers
i
liked
it
and
will
buy
it
again

fruitiness
is

much
hop
presence
to
be
had
standard
and
no
frills
here
but
its
quaffable
and
food
friendly
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
is
just
kind
of
standard
i
would
love
to
try
this
from
a
fresh
cask
in
the
uk
but
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
just
kind
of
generic
it
is
enjoyable
however
a
very
nice
honey
ale
that
takes
on
pilsneresque
flavors
from
time
to
time
honey
gives
more
of
a
honey
suckle
aroma
but
with
true
honey
flavor
and
smooth
feel
a
pleasure
to
drink
interesting
to
try
but
ultimately
not
that
great
kinda
neat
flavor
but
even
though
it
isnt
obviously
sweet
it
creeps
up
and
the
flavor
gets
a
bit
much
after
a
while
the
beer
is
light
but
the
taste
is
fairly
assertive
very
firm
and
wellrounded
with
some
nice
complexity
it
has
a
lot
of
bread
and
leafyherbal
hops
up
front
with
strong
honey
and
grain
and
bread
dough
taking
over
right
at
the
finish
all
the
elements
linger
nicely
but
the
honeybread
dough
character
lingers
longest
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
clear
light
sweetness
and
tinglyzesty
leafy
herbal
hop
bitterness
balancing
nicely
neither
oily
nor
watery
it
has
a
good
firm
feel
and
it
is
highly
drinkable
it
does
lack
some
complexity
though
and
it
is
not
a
beer
id
want
to
go
for
regularly
d
despite
the
sweetness
this
was
actually
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
light
body
probably
helps
that
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
light
amber
color
good
carbonation
and

bodied

d
another
quality
effort
from
fullers
i
liked
that
they
advertised
honey
and
it
was
there
a
no
brainer
to
pick
up
its
fullers
this
is
certainly
drinkable
too
bad
it
doesnt
taste
like
ale
they
should
reclassify
this
as
a
lager
ontap
at
chancey
smiths
in
london
ontario
clear
golden
yellow
in
colour
with
soft
amber
hues
and
a
thin
ring
of
bubbly
white
froth
that
persists
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
some

the

and
agreeable
english
pale
ale
not
much
to
dislike
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
a
little
bit
dissapointing
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
nothing
too
outlandish
but
its
simple
not
bad
and
just
a
little
different
d
if
this
beer
werent
so
hard
to
find
i
would
be
drinking
it
far
more
often
absolutely
great
session
style
beer
with
a
great
honey
sweetness
that
strays
from
the
typical
mild
english
session
ale
after
spending
a
week
in
england
drinking
cask
milds
and
the
like
this
was
a
surprising
beer
for
me
very
unique
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
some
an
easydrinking
palate
offering
honey
to
taste
but
without
being
really
convincing
honey
is
also
present
in
the
nose
in
a
style
more
grilled
the
body
is
a
little
too
soft
and
watery
to
really
satisfy
moreover
the
lack
of
bitterness
often
characteristic
of
fullers
brewery
is
also
disadvantageous
a
model
of
honey
ale
which
gives
an
impression
of
poorly
controlled
perhaps
due
to
the
absence
of
a
higher
abv
to
compensate
for
the
missing
body
which
remains
light
years
ahead
of
belgian
models
lacking
in
complexity
but
fairly
enjoyable
certainly
worth
a
go
on
draught
d
really
a
nicely
crafted
ale
balanced
comes
to
mind
not
outstandingly
perfect
there
are
a
few
nits
to
be
picked
i
suppose
but
this
is
something
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
and
i
like
that
pours
a
clear
straw
yellowish
it
was
a
dark
room
so
i
cant
be
100
sure
with
a
short
lived
head
atop
it
left
light
to
no
lacing
the
nose
of
the
beer
had
a
sweetness
to
it
and
a
bit
of
straw
and
apple
the
beer
itself
was
thin
and
had
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
didnt
have
any
substantive
flavours
or
character
that
left
me
thinking
it
was
much
other
than
a
macro
once
again
the
apple
flavour
was
there
making
me
wonder
if
something
was
wrong
with
this
beer
bubbly
in
the
mouth
and
not
a
beer
i
would
be
reaching
for
again
when
given
a
decent
second
option
this
started
off
like
an
unassuming
if
tame
english
honey
pale
but
ended
falling
on
the
poor
side
of
drinkable
i
find
honey
beers
very
often
lack
something
and
this
is
no
exception
spice
them
like
mead
give
them
some
character
or
do
something
guys
this
is
at
best
bland
at
worst
undrinkable
d
its
not
bad
and
easy
to
drink
but
it
could
use
some
stronger
flavours
and
aromas
d
honey
and
hops
in
the
very
end
fair
enough
as
a
fullers
should
be
its
ok
but
nothing
exciting
a
beer
you
could
have
with
ribs
and
fries
while
watching
the
game
at
the
local
sports
bar
much
better
than
most
ales
served
at
these
places
the
weakest
in
flavour
not
abv
beer
in
the
fullers
range
that
i
have
tried
to
date
clearly
made
for
the
stella
crowd
decent
but
not
for
beer
enthusiasts
or
lovers
of
real
ale
not
a
very
rewarding
beer
unlike
the
rest
of
the
fullers
commercial
export
line
vintage
london
pride
london
porter
esb
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
honeybrewed
ales
about
12
of
them
ive
tried
i
liked
and
the
other
half
i
dont
care
about
but
this
one
is
nice
a
joy
to
drink
mellow
and
well
rounded
just
like
the
rear
label
claims
d
in
my
opinion
this
beer
would
be
enjoyable
all
year
round
as
a
session
beer
or
while
enjoying
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
patio
i
think
this
would
go
well
with
barbecued
chicken
and
would
even
suggest
that
this
could
be
enjoyed
as
a
dessert
beer
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
since
i
discovered
it
and
am
surprised
at
myself
for
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
only
now
i
highly
recommend
this
one
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
offering
the
honey
employed
deftly
i
suppose
and
agreeable
in
a
drink
the
whole
bottle
sense
and
never
approaching
cloying
always
an
asset
when
considering
any
sort
of
honey
beer
sweet
but
balanced
enough
though
honey
is
certainly
the
outstanding
character
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
pours
out
into
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
thing
frothy
head
that
quickly
evaporates
slight
aroma
of
honey
and
hops
you
can
definitely
taste
the
honey
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
the
flavor
is
over
very
quickly
goes
down
smooth
and
is
fairly
refreshing
something
for
a
sunny
day
while
mowing
the
lawn
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
something
to
have
every
now
and
then
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
because
of
the
taste
but
if
you
were
to
dig
it
you
could
easily
pound
these
back
for
a
while
just
not
much
there
note
abv
is
5
according
to
the
bottle
drinkability
this
is
yummy
it
can
be
two
kinds
of
beer
a
refreshing
lagery

type
quaffer
when
chilled
or
a
more
subtle

real

at

temperature
pours
golden

with
decent
white
head
which
dissapeared
quickly
smell
slight
honey
smell
with
touch
of
malts
aroma
is
not
very
strong
though
taste
malts
mostly
with
a
slight
honey
sweetness
very
pleasant
actually
crisp
balanced
beer
with
very
refreshing
taste
quite
drinkable
nice
brew
goes
down
very
smoothly
smooth
although
slightly
thin
gentle
to
moderate
carbonation
light
and
fairly
sweet
this
is
a
decently
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
fullers
honey
dew
is
a
good
summer
brew
and
ice
cold
is
a
great
refresher
the
taste
is
biscuity
and
there
is
a
slight
honey
sweetness
not
to
strong
but
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
a
few
of
and
is
perfect
for
the
summer
witha
bbq
and
also
beats
a
lot
of
honey
beers
on
the
market
d
could
definitely
be
a
refreshing
summer
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
honey
but
a
little
on
the
boring
side
overall
this
was
a
fairly
solid
brew
as
i
would
expect
from
fullers
but
maybe
i
dont
really
get
the
honey
beer
thing
though
i
recall
a
t
smisje
honey
beer
a
few
years
ago
that
appealed
to
me

nice

no

aroma
of

was
not

and
i
liked
the

it

flavour
was

but
too
me
it
was
a
generic
sweetness
and
didnt
identify
with
the
honey
aroma
there
is
also
a
malty
kick
in
there
refreshing
but
boring
ive
had
this
one
a
few
times
before
and
every
time
it
is
a
treat
straightforward
and
tasty
perfect
in
summer
i
really
like
this
one
d
a
nice
beer
that
id
drink
more
often
if
it
was
a
bit
cheaper
i
have
yet
to
try
a
honey
beer
that
has
blown
me
away
oh
well
this
is
still
a
very
well
made
beer
nice
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
but
disappears
half
way
through
smells
a
bit
off
but
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
honey
and
malt
are
evident
on
the
nose
with
some
floral
hop
just
sneaking
in
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
fruit
notes
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
and
of
course
some
honey
clean
and
refreshing
had
on
tap
at
twisted
kilt
2
4
years
later
and
it
was
honeyish
decent
mouthfeel
overall
i
like
it
and
i
plan
on
getting
more
soon
it
will
be
great
for
a
summer
day
especially
good
for
bbqs
very
nice
product
has
me
wishing
it
was
easier
to
find
and
a
bit
cheaper
because
it
could
easily
become
my
brew
of
choice
in
the
summer
a
taste
of
summer
with
a
london
accent
light
well
balanced
and
flavorfull
with
that
distinctive
fullers
brewery
taste
i
liked
the
subtle
honey
taste
on
the
finish
that
arose
when
the
beer
warmed
well
done
for
a
sessionable
summer
beer
that
has
a
certain
english
flair
overall
a
nice
summer
ale
very
refreshing
the
sour
edge
makes
this
beer
very
moreish

pity
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
have
would
make
a
great
session
ale
but
the
spicy
herbal
clover
from
the
honey
eventually
starts
to
overwhelm
the
malt
and
get
to
me
would
make
a
nice
glass
of
ale
to
relax
with
on
a
late
summerautumn
evening
doesnt
rate
too
high
for
me
nothing
bad
about
it
but
nothing
that
gets
me
going
i
take
this
brew
as
a
second
fullers
favorite
next
to
their
porter
its
so
drinkable
and
enjoyable
id
be
tempted
to
make
this
a
favored
session
ale
and
daily
drinker
but
the
price
prohibits
that
very
drinkable
summer
fare
would
make
great
session
or
crossover
fare
nothing
challenging
here
but
i
may
be
looking
for
this
one
when
the
next
heatwave
strikes
crystal
clear
pale
gold
with
a
shortlived
rocky
bright
white
head
there
was
a

then

im
getting
used
to
those
american
honey
brown
beer
where
honey
is
quite
subdued
definitely
too
sweet
for
my
own
personal
liking
and
one
of
the
worst
from
this
brewery
this
is
a
honey
beer
that
tastes
like
honey
without
it
being
overwhelming
its
smooth
and
very
refreshing
not
a
session
beer
but
a
nice
one
off
not
much
head
at
all
but
a
nice
honey
colour
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
that
claim
to
be
honey
lagers
that
have
none
of
the
qualities
of
honey
this
one
does
its
a
very
well
crafted
quality
product
overall
an
ok
beer
nothing
ground
breaking
but
quite
drinkable
although
it
gets
a
little
sweet
towards
the
end
worth
a
try
its
a
shame
that
this
beer
seems
like
an
underachiever
compared
to
the
london
porter
d
easily
approachable
quite
quaffable
this
is
quite
a
nice
honey
ale
i
will
likely
get
this
one
again
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
its
got
plenty
of
honey
flavor
and
a
good
deal
of
complexity
my
only
criticism
is
it
could
use
more
hop
and
malt
flavors
d
its
alright
but
nothing
special
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
and
needs
some
balance
pours
yellow
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
colour
tinge
small
head
about
a
half
finger
thick
which
disipated
slowly
sharp
grass
scent
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
malt
sweetness
very
refreshing
taste
sharp
hop
bite
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
of
honey
and
flowers
smooth
mouthfeel
though
not
creamy
has
enough
carbonation
to
have
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
overall
a
decent
beer
this
actually
reminds
me
more
of
a
lager
than
a
pale
ale
reasonably
refreshing
and
smooth
but
no
real
wow
factor
very
nice
on
a
hot
day
like
today
fullers
is
capable
of
far
better
not
to
my
taste
at
all
nice
bite
on
the
tongue
and
invites
you
to
hold
it
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
before
swallowing
smooth
going
down
but
still
i
cant
say
id
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
due
to
the
fact
that
im
not
a
sweettooth
md
very
smooth
and
only
softlycarbonated
on
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
very
lightbodied
for
its
alc
strength
easy
drinking
but
slightly
boring
if
compared
with
other
british
honey
beers
on
offer
even
the
same
beers
tapversion
is
slightly
more
complex
than
this
bottle
pours
absolutely
golden
as
if
it
were
a
pils
smells
mildly
of
fruity
hops
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
fruity
followed
by
massive
grain
that
wont
be
ignored
i
like
the
grain
at
first
but
it
becomes
tiresome
halfway
through
the
glass
nice
full
mouth
id
drink
one
again
if
offered
but
there
are
many
beers
out
there
id
rather
have
d
average
because
its
an
ok
beer
but
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
500

golden

moderate

good

moderate
carbonation
aroma
of
malts
and
honey
some
flowery
notes
too
flavour
is
honey
sweet
and
mellow
but
not
cloying
fairly
well
balanced
with
the
target
hops
nice
enough
i
dont
really
get
this
one
i
reviewed
it
chilled
maybe
i
should
try
it
really
cold
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
little
or
no
head
the
taste
is
very
fragrant
and
sweet
like
a
pinch
of
fruits
mixed
with
honey
the
synthesis
of
the
two
create
an
almost
chocolaty
sense
the
taste
is
all
encompassing
yet
not
overbearing
you
can
taste
the
wheat
in
it
and
the
hops
come
in
at
the
end
there
is
little
after
taste
and
if
anything
it
is
just
the
bubbling
of
the
carbonation
in
your
throat
other
comments
not
a
bad
beer
as
it
definitely
reflects
the
quality
that
is
common
with
fullers
and
i
swear
im
not
imagining
the
honeydew
thing
just
because
of
the
name
a
fairly
good
ale
better
than
waggledance
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
almost
no
head
and
the
bubbles
dissapated
quickly
at
first
taste
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
beer
because
it
has
some
sweetness
to
it
you
can
detect
some
of
the
honeydew
flavor
it
sort
of
has
a
mead
flavor
it
was
pretty
malty
after
the
first
taste
and
finished
off
kind
of
odd
just
too
sweet
i
guess
it
was
definitely
good
and
could
try
some
more
pretty
good
one
of
the
best
of
the
honey
beers
better
than
youngs
waggledance
slightly
sweet
honeylike
start
decent
malty
middle
a
few
bready
sort
of
notes
and
a
decently
hoppy
finish
slight
citrus
my
only
problems
were
the
slight
sweetness
and
general
lightness
of
the
beer
but
besides
that
i
have
no
problems
similar
flavours
some
bready
note
though
reasonable
hop
bitterness
optional
review
minimum
of
five
words
i
always
admire
when
simple
ingredients
and
processes
yield
spectacular
beers
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
that
an
english
pale
ale
thats
real
hoppy
and
not
with
tropical
new
world
varietals
but
with
the
classics
these
beers
are
traditional
for
a
reason
and
i
think
the
aggressive
use
of
these
hops
make
this
beer
awesome
the
english
ale
yeast
profile
is
minimal
and
the
grain
base
while
sturdy
and
appropriate
is
not
overly
flavorful
it
lets
the
hops
do
the
majority
of
the
work
in
the
flavor
which
i
think
is
right
on
for
the
style
but
also
lets
me
taste
these
hops
in
higher
doses
than
we
usually
get
them
its
bitter
sure
but
there
is
also
a
pearlike
fruitiness
to
it
in
the
finish
and
a
really
clean
aspect
where
they
go
away
really
quick
for
how
flavorful
they
are
just
a
touch
more
honey
sweetness
from
the
grain
than
i
need
and
maybe
a
little
more
body
too
than
i
need
for
a
beer
i
want
to
consume
by
the
six
pack
but
the
high
carbonation
and
clean
finish
both
help
with
drinkability
simple
beer
made
right
i
always
appreciate
that
and
this
is
a
good
take
on
the
style
with
that
mentality
drink
it
close
to
freezing
though
it
loses
some
of
its
pop
as
it
warms
up
definitely
reminds
me
a
bit
of
snpa
but
not
quite
as
cascade
citrus
driven
a
nice
balance
is
struck
with
hops
taking
a
slight
edge
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
pale
ale
a
good
one
to
sip
leisurely
o
ok
this
longneck
was
from
a
friends
variety
pack
and
im
not
sure
how
long
those
packs
sit
around
tastes
not
so
fresh
this
is
in
the
english
vein
but
you
expect
more
fruity
yeast
characters
a
stronger
malt
base
and
more
appropriate
hop
levels
meh
o
this
is
a
deliciously
hoppy
pale
ale
with
nice
orangey
aromas
and
flavors
definitely
recommended
oa
malty
boring
english
pale
ale
the
hops
were
hardly
there
if
at
all
i
know
epa
arent
hopforward
but
it
needed
something
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
obtainable
in
cans
which
are
much
easier
to
recycle
if
the
can
lends
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
that
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
foam
some
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drink
it
down
standard
pint
glass
a
nice
balance
between
hops
and
malt
good
hop
bit
up
front
and
nice
mild
citrus
flavor
smells
malty
with
a
slight
tinge
of
piney
hops
all
in
all
a
nice
pale
ale
its
billed
as
an
english
style
pale
ale
and
its
closer
to
that
than
an
apa
but
its
definitely
an
american
made
english
style
pale
ale
but
in
a
good
way
a
very
sessionable
ale
at
only
5
abv
this
might
be
my
new
go
to
canned
pale
ale
much
more
to
my
taste
than
sierra
nevada
canned
pale
ale
one
snowy
coldass
day
in
missoula
the
big
sky
brewing
team
met
to
discuss
their
next
brew
the
decision
had
been
made
and
the
scape
goat
pale
ale
was
brought
into
this
world
this
beer
is
really
not
a
scape
goat
but
truly
below
average
i
usually
love
pale
ales
but
this
one
was
overly
bitter
and
hard
to
put
down
let
alone
enjoy
ill
pass
on
the
scape
goat
next
time
beer
is
mildly
bitter
nice
finish
no
aftertaste
interesting
malt
make
up
marris
otter
maybe
hard
to
discern
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
a
repeat
d
overall
its
a
very
good
english
pale
ale
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
nice
floral
and
pine
notes
grapefruit
tart
feel
and
sour
taste
is
fantastic
the
body
was
a
bit
fuller
than
is
typical
for
the
style
and
the
finish
was
just
a
wee
bit
sticky
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
disappeared
quickly
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
a
refreshing
change
from
the
ipalite
that
a
lot
of
apas
suffer
from
certainly
worth
grabbing
a
sixer
to
take
on
the
trails
or
out
on
river
with
viva
el
cans
notes
pale
ales
are
difficult
to
review
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
ale
it
is
just
not
to
my
taste
a
pretty
good
goat
this
is
decent
enough
ale
malty
and
hop
tones
combine
to
make
a
hearty
drink
it
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
unique
character
or
something
that
would
make
an
impression
always
nice
to
try
a
new
beer
but
i
doubt
i
would
ever
go
back
to
this
one
o
meh
take
a
walk
on
this
one
if
youve
got
a
better
choice
totally
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
bought
this
as
a
single
12
oz
at
philnor
liquor
in
lakewood
colorado
o
overall
the
beer
is
just
meh
light
body
ale
that
goes
down
easy
and
was
a
good
choice
for
an
easydrinking
summer
afternoon
will
turn
to
this
one
again
atmosphere

good
really
nice
dark

a

biting
with
a

and

overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff

with
a

there
is
a
mild

on

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
refreshing
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
probably
not
one
id
buy
again
and
certainly
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
but
id
have
no
problems
drinking
it
if
offered
not
great
indifferent
malt
bill
which
for
an
english
pale
ale
seems
odd
and
unappetising
hop
character
love
the
can
style
and
thanks
to
beermasons
for
this
offering
and
it
pours

with

overall
its

down
i
mean
i
love
the

but
i
definately
would
not
revisit
this
one
anytime
soon
cheers
overall
another
wellrounded
beer
from

i
really
havent
had
a
bad

yet

this
is
just
another

brew
to
add
to
the
list
d
insanely
drinkable
and
tasty
if
i
could
get
this
here
in
ohio
it
would
definitely
be
a
goto
brew
thanks
drew
and
charlie
from
montana
do
the
hook
up
overall
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
pretty
smooth
but
the
flavor
wasnt
very
pleasing
at
it
left
a
bitter
off
putting
taste
other
beers
from
big
sky
show
more
promise
than
this
one
overall
just
not
impressed
especially
for
what
you
have
to
pay
for
it
around
here
too
bad
i
had
higher

o
a
solid
crisp
clean
tasting
pale
ale
im
glad
to
have
this
changeup
from
all
of
the
heavy
brews
ive
been
drinking
lately
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
really
nice
pale
ale
it
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
and
savory
o
this
beer
is
kinda
what
i
expected
it
to
be
i
think
its
good
the
hops
are
very
refreshing
along
with
the
high
carbonation
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
balancing
to
it
though
a
touch
of
toast
along
those
lines
the
punch
of
citrus
like
hops
could
have
been
toned
down
as
well
all
in
all
id
drink
it
again
but
i
would
prefer
something
else
clean
simple
crisp
refreshing
an
average
pale
ale
that
wont
win
any
awards
but
will
satisfy
the
beer
enthusiast
on
a
budget
prickly
and
lively
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
wellcarbonated
pale
ale
but
not
overdone
the
palate
is
somewhat
resinous
with
a
smooth
and
easy
finish
light
copper
bronze
with
an
orange
tinge
small
amounts
of
white
foam
stick
malty
smell
light

but
unimpressive
lightly
hopped

taste
even
keeled
with

flavor
nondescript
pale
which
isnt
to
say
it
isnt
good
easy
drinker
with
enough
pop
to
stay
interested
its
alright
definitely
wouldnt
be
purchasing
this
one
anything
soon
great
for
a
float
trip
though
a
beautiful
light
whisps
of
club
cracker
malts
and
some
lemon
and
spice
come
to
form
the
nose
a
good
malty
backbone
bathes
the
tongue
and
lets
hints
of
lemon
and
mint
hop
flavors
shine
a
really
pleasant
flavor
creamy
medium
body
a
little
ability
to
stay
for

aftertaste
this
really
surprised
me
as
a
pleasantly
palatable
ale
thanx
bsbc
big
thanks
goes
out
to
cassino
for
just
giving

a

with

head
that
subsided
to
a

maintained

throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet

and
a
floral
note
the
flavor
was
of
sweet

caramel
tobacco
citrus
citrus
hop
earth
and
subtle

notes
it
had
a

feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
flavors
on
this
one
were
quite
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
tobacco
aspect
was
really
quite
surprising
on
this
one
somehow
it
managed
to
blend
in
with
the
rest
decently
the
citrus
was
the
saving
grace
for
this
one
in
my
opinion
worth
your
time
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
o
overall
a
very
nice
pale
ale
as
i
said
above
its
very
crisp
and
clean
not
overly
complex
but
very
delicious
poured
with
a
small
to
medium
sized
cream
colored
head
that
quickly
subsided
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
more
caramel
malt
than
hop
along
with
some
toffee
and
raisins
flavor
is
like
nose
but
hops
take
a
very
slight
edge
over
caramel
and
some
carbonic
tang
with
hints
of
dark
ripe
fruit
body
is
decent
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
to
long
in
duration
ok
beer
nothing
special
the
can
in
this
case
is
shaped
like
a
bottle
overall
its
a
damn
fine
beer
and
has
the
added
bonus
of
coming
in
a
can
i
would
happily
fish
all
day
long
drinking
this
stuff
overall
i
rather
like
this
beer
i
think
it
could
be
a
goto
brew
for
tailgating
and
barbecuing
its
not
perfect
but
it
is
refreshing
and
tasty
for
what
it
is

this
is
a
lightly
hopped
version
of
an
american
style
pale
ale
or
the
ale
has
become
malt
heavy
from
age
as
other
reviews
discussed
the
grapefruty
bitterness
all
in
all
quite
pleasing
and
a
change
of
pace
for
an
american
pale
tasty
a
wellbalanced
ipa
for
the
summer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
dark
golden
look
head
was
about
an
inch
and
a
half
that
left
a
quarterinch
or
more
film
lots
of
flavors
in
the
smell
and
seemed
heavy
mild
to
heavy
on
the
carbonation
flavor
was
a
dark
red
left
plenty
of
film
on
the
glass
each
sip
could
feel
the
film
sitting
in
my
mouth
havent
experienced
that
since
i
started
rating
only
a
week
and
about
13
beers
reminded
me
of
that
candy
that
fizzes
in
your
mouth
taste
never
got
better
as
it
went
on
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
some
lacing
bready
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
lemony
peppery
hop
nose
buiscuty
malt
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
nice
backbone
of
bittering
hops
really
nicely
integrated
tight
carbonation
gives
it
a
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
might
start
buying
for
an
easy
drinking
quaffable
pale
ale
o
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
enough
of
a
hop
and
malt
taste
to
satisfy
but
it
remains
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
it
is
well
constructed
and
favors
the
hop
taste
slightly
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
of
the
apa
is
a
nice
clear
amber
it
produced
a
nice
white
head
and
left
behind
a
good
amount
of
lacing
good
head
retention
the
aroma
of
the
apa
was
very
nice
it
was
full
of
malt
hops
and
citrus
notes
this
apa
was
a
medium
bodied
ale
it
has
a
nice
malt
base
that
was
complimented
with
citrus
and
hops
very
well
balanced
apa
not
outstanding
but
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
o
nothing
offensive
just
not
much
there
pretty
average
scape
goat
me
likie
this
is
a
very
good
and
sublte
pale
ale
reminds
me
alot
of
new
belgiums
skinny
dip
the
appearance
is
a
nice
golden
slightly
amber
clear
color
modest
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
as
sublte
hops
and
citrus
which
feed
beautifully
into
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
for
me
i
like
the
sublte
pale
characteristics
of
the
beer
which
doesnt
hang
on
the
pallete
very
long
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
pale
ale
was
average
at
best
in
the
end
it
was
just
too
unbalanced
for
me
to
enjoy
there
were
tons
of
sweet
pale
malts
in
this
brew
and
they
needed
some
nice
floral
hops
to
balance
everything
out
some
pale
ales
tend
to
have
too
much
hops
but
this
one
didnt
have
enough
and
that
hurt
it
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
spot
on
but
the
aroma
and
taste
need
some
work
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
too

overall
it
is
a

nothing
that
rocks
my
world
but
nothing
offensive
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
drinks
really
easy
a
nice
quencher
that
works
for
the
style
but
id
rather
have
their
big

ipa
or

or
oks
own

native
amber
for
the
same
price
i
wish
theyd
canned
the
ipa
instead
still
a
nice

option
this
pours
a
pale
amber
or
so
with
a
nice
frothy
one
finger
head
with
great
retention
and
good
lacing
on
the
nose
there
is
wet
straw
biscuit
maybe
a
little
bit
of
piney
hop
aroma
in
the
mouth
the
biscuit
is
up
front
maybe
some
floral
notes
and
a
little
bitterness
but
mostly
the
biscuity
malts
and
some
yeast
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
too
much
staying
power
as
far
as
finish
is
concerned
i
drank
three
of
these
tonight
and
it
hit
the
spot
pretty
good
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
other
apas
ive
had
the
feel
is
razor
sharp
initially
from
the
carbonation
the
body
itself
does
have
quite
a
bit
of
viscosity
to
it
the
finish
is
a
bit
slimy
with
a
little
dryness
not
a
bad
beer
didnt
care
for
the
odor
though
perhaps
a
bottle
next
time
but
not
my
favorite
big
sky
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
exceptionally
light
for
an
apa
it
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
as
well
not
a
part
of
this
beer
that
i
enjoy
overall
this
is
an
apa
that
could
use
more
malt
flavor
to
balance
it
out
and
a
bit
heavier
mouthfeel
i
usually
bitch
about
apas
that
dont
have
enough
hops
but
id
say
the
opposite
for
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
hoppy
character
but
nothing
else
to
add
i
wish
big
sky
would
put
a
bit
more
work
into
this
beer
as
it
has
the
potential
to
be
an
elite
apa
with
the
hops
factor
as
it
is
now
it
doesnt
come
close
if
you
like
your
pale
ale
on
the
hoppy
side

is
very
drinkable

with

a

overlays
doughy

contribution
to
to
the
nose
medium
bodied
typical
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
malt
and
hops
mixing
in
a
biscuity
citrus
concoction
the
melding
of
the
two
isnt
perfect
leaving
the
beer
a
few
rough
edges
overall
a
drinkable
beer
cant
complain
do
my
dirty
work
clearly
metallica
had
big
sky
on
the
brain
this
particular
brew
therefrom
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
grapefruit
flowers
and
some
mild
caramel
the
taste
runs
along
a
similar
road
though
the
grapefruit
is
replaced
by
some
mandarin
oranges
sans
the
syrup
honestly
this
seems
to
help
matters
a
decent
deal
the
body
is
a
heavyish
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
apa
nothing
really
special
but
the
lean
toward
orange
instead
of
grapefruit
makes
things
all
the
better
to
me
this
baby
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
orange
with
a
quick
fading
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
of
nice
citrusy
hops
mostly
like
imitation
orange
that
youd
get
from
a
glade
plugin
which
is
the
predominant
aroma
with
a
bit
of
nostril
detective
work
some
caramel
might
be
able
to
be
pulled
from
the
woodwork
of
this
beer
the
flavor
consists
mainly
of
a
citrus
explosion
up
front
that
degrades
quicker
than
a
snowman
in
a
heatwave
the
flavor
quickly
turns
from
sweetness
into
bitterness
as
is
moves
its
way
back
on
the
tongue
then
fades
into
obscurity
on
the
back
end
aside
from
the
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
and
it
would
serve
as
an
enjoyable
beer
for
the
price
its
a
good
beer
that
is
by
no
means
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
but
it
has
its
place
in
the
world
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
and
formed
a
snow
white
head
that
left
layered
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
pine
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
and
toffee
medium
light
body
and
a
fairly
sweet

a
pale

to
not
like
mine
that

a
nice
light

a

the
nose
brings
a
decent
amount
of

zest
along
with
some
doughy
bread
taste
brings
a
bit
of
orange
and
lemon
along
with
a
slightly
sweet
malt
backbone
the
citrus
character
is
well
balanced
and
nicely
done
but
is
quite
faint
and
hard
to
pull
out

light

thats

really

my
local

store
knows
how
to
hook
it
up
thank
god
definitely
a
solid
beginner
beer
in
the
apa
style
not
the
worst
not
the
best
but
an
excellent
representation
of
everything
that
i
want
from
an
apa
and
the
hop
character
is
not
overwhelmed
with
a
pine
flavor
so
it
definitely
will
be
a
good
recruit
beer
enjoy
if
you
can
find
it
d
this
is
damn
good
pretty
surprised
not
my
usual
style
definitely
recommend
this
will
be
buying
again
d
a
decent
pale
ale
drinks
alright
made
it
to
michigan
just
in
time
for
summer
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
apa
id
order
another
at
a
bar
perhaps
although
i
dont
know
if
id
want
a
whole
6er
in
the
fridge
it
could
use
a
bit
more
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
perhaps
a
little
stronger
backing
malt
d
decent
all
around
pale
ale
from
big
sky
hop
flavor
could
be
brought
up
a
bit
more
but
its
nicely
drinkable
the
way
it
is
pretty
wellbalanced
big

scape
goat
pale
ale
was
a
gold
color
with
a
tiny
offwhite
head
that
promptly
dissipated
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
missing
in
action
other
than
a
faint
barley
water
scent
the
taste
was
a
bland
small
citrus
flavor
that
didnt
offend
but
didnt
impress
either
the
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
was
not
good
while
the
abv
cooperated
the
taste
just
didnt
do
anything
im
not
trying
to
be
funny
or
anything
this
was
just
very
weak
in
all
respects
the
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
appeared
to
be
060310
so
i
dont
think
that
was
the
problem
i
still
have
a
couple
of
bottle
so
ill
try
another
later
and
edit
if
i
was
just
having
a
bad
day
or
something
disappointed
with
this
one
and
wish
i
did
not
buy
a
six
pack
this
beer
needs
more
flavor
a
fine
apa
after
having
brews
like
gumball
head
from
3f
and
two
hearted
from
bells
this
brew
falls
short
however
if
im
in
a
bar
with
nothing
but
this
or
macros
then
i
would
be
far
from
disappointed
pours
golden
orange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
citrus
hops
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
very
nice
aroma
the
flavor
is
citrus
hops
with
quite
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
as
well
there
is
also
a
nice
malt
backbone
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
overly
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
a
solid
example
of
an
american
pale
ale
d
great
session
beer
at
4
7
something
i
will
keep
in
my
fridge
for
sure
overall
this
wasnt
the
pale
ale
for
me
it
just
tasted
weedy
all
around
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
and
if
that
is
the
case
i
will
reevaluate
on
my
next
bottle
i
would
rather
choose
another
pale
ale
though
well
i
wasnt
really
sure
about
big
sky
until
this
i
couldnt
really
ask
for
more
from
this
beer
its
good
quality
no
doubt
about
it
the
taste
is
superior
as
with
the
other
big
sky
brews
its
very
distinctive
this
is
a
great
beer
ill
drink
it
again
a
standup
english
pale
ale
as
it
hits
its
target
a
quaffer
session
beer
as
well
another
fine
brewery
and
beer
now
available
in
the
midwest
stl
mo
market
not
a
bad
pale
ale
and
one
which
is
probably
overlooked
id
have
this
one
again
especially
considering
its
a
very
reasonably
priced
brew
d
pretty
good
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
from
time
to
time
good
mouthfeel
fullbodied
yet
well
balanced
drinkable
d
i
liked
it
may
not
be
the
beallendall
apa
but
it
seemed
very
consistent
and
quite
enjoyable
maybe
a
little
too
dry
and
bitter
to
drink
them
all
night
but
definitely
worth
having
one
or
two
d
pretty
good
nicely
done
example
of
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
transparent
amber
color
ale
with
thin
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
pine
and
grapefruit
arguably
the
best
characteristic
the
brew
administers
a
moderate
hop
flavor
to
the
palate
with
citrus
and
pine
qualities
while
bitterness
fades
and
dries
quickly
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
seltzer
like
feel
pretty
average
example
of
an
apa
i
would
prefer
more
hops
and
a
more
substantial
body
a
middleoftheroad
apafar
from
bad
but
certainly
not
stellar
it
is
well
crafted
and
drinkable
just
a
bit
forgettable
mouthfeel
was
medium

adequate
but
understated

a
bitter
appearance
as
well
taste
most
consists
of
subtle
sweet
citrus
similar
to
the
nose
nothing
really
special
about
the
quaff
in
any
way
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
drinkability
is
just
okay
not
really
that
great
of
a
tasting
brew
but
i
could
probably
handle
several
of
them
d
refreshing
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
nice
clarity
moving
towards
copper
but
not
quite
that
deep
the
head
is
thin
offwhite
but
leaves
pretty
decent
lacing
i
actually
kind
of
like
the
look
of
it
but
its
not
impressive
the
smell
has
a
nice
leafy
kind
of
grassy
hop
presence
with
a
deep
but
fairly
light
american
hop
aroma
which
is
good
an
apa
especially
a
5
abv
one
does
not
need
to
smell
like
a
hop
bomb
the
malt
presence
is
caramelly
and
sweet
a
little
powdery
also
a
slight
toasty
smell
almsot
like
pretzels
the
taste
is
just
as
enjoyable
as
the
smell
starts
off
lightly
bready
a
bit
cakey
but
nice
and
dry
and
crisp
a
good
toastiness
is
present
too
a
feature
i
really
like
in
an
apa
the
hop
profile
is
upfront
leafy
and
herbal
not
very
citrusy
which
can
be
good
in
a
beer
like
this
but
theres
a
nice
bite
of
orange
in
the
middle
maybe
some
light
grapefruit
but
not
much
bitterness
or
resinous
feeling
finishes
a
little
grassy
but
a
nice
malty
sweetness
comes
in
too
though
you
do
notice
that
its
a
bit
thin
in
the
finish
thats
really
my
only
complaint
theres
so
much
interesting
going
on
but
the
body
is
actually
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
the
carbonation
isnt
sharp
but
you
feel
it
in
unexpected
places
and
ways
still
interesting
and
at
this
abv
this
one
is
easy
drinking
but
youd
never
expect
it
to
be
so
low
based
on
the
flavor
really
a
very
good
beer
if
it
was
around
i
could
possibly
make
it
a
stapletype
beer
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
dancingcaddis
thanks
nice
pale
orangeyellow
color
decent
head
looks
about
as
good
as
any
other
pale
ale
the
smell
is
nondescript
and
boring
there
is
really
nothing
that
stands
out
the
flavor
seems
to
follow
suit
a
little
bit
of
biscuit
flavor
but
other
than
that
it
is
completely
boring
i
am
not
saying
this
beer
is
bad
at
all
because
it
is
very
easy
to
put
down
but
it
is
just
bland
overall
orange
in
color
with
a
frothy
head
and
lots
of
prickle
that
doesnt
rise
at
all
in
the
glass
the
nose
is
malty
and
slides
smoothly
in
the
nostrils
the
attack
is
refreshing
and
displays
a
creamy
mouthfeel
for
the
beer
the
hops
presents
itself
late
the
finish
has
some
residual
hoppiness
in
the
mouth
that
carries
through
to
provide
a
hoppy
aftertaste
drinking
this
beer
is
like
a
journey
from
the
malty
to
the
hops
it
is
certainly
my
favorite
of
the
big
sky
beers
i
have
tried
notes
this
is
one
of
the
first
pale
ales
i
really
enjoyed
it
is
a
bit
stronger
than
most
though
not
quite
up
there
with
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
i
would
recommend
this
for
anyone
looking
for
an
easy
to
drink
refreshing
beer
a
bit
stronger
than
i
like
pale
ales
to
be
but
is
drinkable
drinkability
by
american
standards
this
is
clearly
a
sessionable
beer
4
7abv
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
immensely
in
the
context
of
winding
down
after
a
hot
and
humid
summer
day
i
realize
a
basic
pale
ale
doesnt
get
much
dazzling
press
in
the
circles
of
beer
geekdom
which
im
a
proud
member
of
these
days
but
if
youre
searching
for
a
reasonably
priced
wellmade
sessionable
apa
this
is
your
beer
nice
job
big
sky
folks
scape
goat
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
stickiness
that
enhances
the
bitter
finish
without
allowing
the
bitterness
to
be
too
much
well
balanced
on
the
whole
and
that
lingering
bitterness
sucks
me
in
for
another
sip
im
pleasantly
surprised
and
id
gladly
session
with
this
beer
conclusion
a
bit
above
average
better
than
your
typical
pale
like
say
bass
but
nothing
special
i
like
this
beer
nothing
special
but
very
good
non
the
less
pick
some
up
if
you
want
an
easy
drinking
and
well
balances
pale
ale
big
sky
continues
to
impress
me
they
might
not
make
the
extreme
high
abv
beers
but
every
offering
i
have
had
from
them
is
very
flavor
full
and
could
be
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
non
craft
drinkers
d
very
sessionable
aroma
and
taste
is
inviting
maybe
a
little
light
in
the
mouithfeel
but
finish
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
mouthfeel
is
firm
and
crisp
flavor
is
muted
and
tame
does
not
follow
the
nose
no
citrus
or
piney
hop
presence
rather
there
is
a
dry
husky
grainy
flavor
its
pleasant
but
nothing
special
not
too
bad

beer

i
have
had
better
examples
of
either

d
not

not

this
is
a
little
underpowered
and
simple
but
the
soft

relatively
gentle

are
pleasant
enough
this
might
be
a
good
pale
ale
for
a

isnt

buy
this
again
it

dthis
is
an
inoffensive
brew
that
goes
down

and
is
sessionable
but
the
lack
of
a
real
flavor
profile
makes
me
not
want
to
reach
for
it
it
is
an
alcohol
delivery
system
nothing
more
thanks
deliriumfest
for
the
opportunity
got
this
bottle
at
joes
place
up
in

smells
bready

taste
was
good
i
really
liked
the
taste
of
this
pale
not
overly
hoppy
had
a
nice
hoppy
taste
up
front
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thin
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
hate
the
two

limit
i
now
remember
why
i
started
reviewing
on
rateberr
com
mid
body
good

i
would
buy
this
mixed
up
twelve

appearance
light
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
floral
and
citrus
the
taste
is
citrus
malt
kinda
chalky
hints
of
corn
and
floral
the
finish
is
clean
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
not
as
hoppy
as
some
american
pale
ales
id
like
to
get
this
beer
to
share
with
those
not
necessarily
into
the
crafts
especially
for
a
long
days
drinking
recommended
it
you
are
looking
for
something
a
bit
lighter
on
the
palate
great
cask
mouthfeel
smooth
and
full
with
a
little
hop
oil
slickness
this
is
great
a
little
hard
to
finish
the
end
of
the
glass
and
i
didnt
care
for
another
but
a
tasty
little
treat
all
around
scape
goat
is
a
good
beer
while
not
overly
complex
it
could
make
a
great
sessioner
i
for
one
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
clear
yet
strong
copper
color
uderneath
quick
spongey
head
and
a
few
small
spots
of
bubbling
upfront
braed
with
some
funky
hops
and
a
faint
smell
of
ginger
ale
heavily
toasted
malts
mix
with
some
minty
grapefruit
hops
for
the
bitter
finish
the
palate
has
quick
hop
and
even
quicker
malt
flavors
leaving
th
palate
feeling
pretty
moist
though
but
withno
lingering
flavors
good
session
beer
need
to
try
on
tap
very
nice
apa
id
like
to
drink
more
of
these
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
a
crisp
carbonation
this
is
an
ok
pale
ale
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
here
worth
giving
this
one
a
try
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
good
but
not
over
the
top
pale
ale
i
had
to
check
to
see
if
i
poured
big
sky
ipa
in
the
glass
instead
of
the
apa
but
it
is
the
apa
and
a
bitter
one
at
that
very
refreshing
and
a
lighter
body
and
low
abv
makes
these
go
down
fast
and
easy
drinkability
it
is
a
nice
all
around
beer
well
balanced
drinkable
apa
a
nice
enough
standard
apa
very
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
a
good
mild
balanced
pale
ale
this
is
my
first
beer
from
both
the
big
sky
brewing
co
and
the
state
of
montana
im
quite
pleased
with
what
this
beer
has
to
offer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
montanabrewed
beer
but
i
suppose
that
the
earthy
label
that
i
used
for
the
smell
would
adequately
describe
what
to
expect
in
the
future
once
the
scape
goat
warms
up
just
a
bit
its
easier
to
experience
and
appreciate
the
flavors
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
d
easy
drinking
brew
d
good
session
brew
nothing
particularly
special
here
but
a
nice
beer
overall
poured
a
light
copper
with
a
small
white
head
nose
was
average
notes
of
light
citrus
hops
and
some
malts
and
taste
was
a
below
average
from
the
pales
i
am
used
to
drinking
here
in
california
i
did
not
like
the
malts
and
found
it
rather
weak
on
the
hops
the
bottle
was
not
that
good
in
my
opinion
but
i
would
attempt
the
tap
version
pours
a
nice
cleanclean
dark
golden

foamy

nice
sticky

the
nose
is
malty
with
some
slight

some

thrown
in
and
some

the
taste
is
pretty
nice
sweet
malty
with
some
hoppiness
citrus
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
would
buy
again
recommended
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
as
how
the
liquor
store
owner
pointed
it
out
to
me
as
a
great
beer
i
was
thoughouly
dissapointed
with
this
one
i
think
i
had
my
hopes
up
to
high
for
this
one
not
bad
in
general
but
one
i
will
try
to
avoid
in
the
future
nothing
special
but
still
a
good
brew
d
a
very
good
pale
ale
out
of
big
sky
definitely
the
winner
in
the
mixed
12er
definitely
pick
this
up
if
you
live
out
west
appearance
is
hazy
orangegold
with
decent
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malts
and
light
fruitiness
with
very
appealing
musty
yeast
odor
the
beer
goes
down
effortlessly
with
bright
sweet
flavors
followed
by
just
a
short
sharp
kick
of
hops
which
are
neither
especially
bitter
nor
lasting
mouthfeel
really
good
smooth
and
substantial
without
being
thick
id
recommend
this
one
to
friends
the
beer
will
make
a
decent
session
brew
just
based
on
the
texture
and
flavor
being
relatively
mild
for
a
pale
ale
color
is
a
dark
orange
with
a
very
light
head
smells
lightly
of
malt
and
spice
and
slightly
of
citrus
not
a
lot
of
aroma
but
what
there
is
is
nice
tastes
of
malt
spice
a
wee
bit
of
citrus
and
finishes
with
a
surprisingly
strong
bitter
aftertaste
the
bitterness
adds
an
intriguing
note
and
makes
this
beer
pretty
darned
drinkable
this
brew
has
a
bright
orange
color
with
a
12
in
head
that
left
decent
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
distinctively
of
wonderful
hops
a
minimal
spice
note
was
also
noticed
my
first
taste
noticed
that
there
was
a
multitude
of
hops
with
some
more
bitter
and
some
a
little
milder
the
balance
was
very
good
with
this
beer
this
was
a
lighter
body
brew
with
light
carbonation
but
the
after
taste
was
just
right
for
a
pale
ale
this
was
better
than
the
other
big
sky
brew
i
tried
drinkablity
great
refreshing
brew
a
bit
light
for
a
pale
ale
but
very
drinkable
drinkability
its
okay
a
fine
refreshing
englishminded
pale
ale
nice
session
brew
not
too
hoppy
for
frequent
consumption
recommended
id
have
this
again
and
a
few
at
a
time
before
the
aftertaste
got
the
better
of
me
not
bad
at
all
not
the
best
ive
had
in
this
category
but
would
have
again
an
ok
beer
i
guess
but
i
really
have
no
reason
to
want
to
try
another
not
as
good
as
most
pale
ales
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
a
very
nice
apa
hoppier
than
i
expected
ive
had
this
beer
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
really
remember
trying
to
taste
it
i
am
glad
i
finally
started
reviewing
beers
not
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
but
a
very
drinkable
and
non
hophead
friendly
offering
a
good
starter
a
clear
pale
amber
colored
brew
with
a
thin
but
full
cover
of
offwhite
head
and
nice
thick
lace
the
aroma
to
me
was
an
odd
blend
of
grapefruit
hops
and
a
bit
of
old
fashioned
urinal
essence
the
grapefruit
part
was
good
sharp
and
pretty
strong
the
taste
is
very
sharp
thin
grapefruit
and
orange
with
little
or
no
malt
presence
to
me
this
is
quite
bitter
and
a
little
peppery
it
has
a
nice
fine
carbonation
pretty
refreshing
and
drinkable
enough
but
to
me
its
more
astringent
than
i
normally
would
enjoy
so
i
wouldnt
call
this
highly
drinkable
pretty
unique
and
tasted
a
little
more
palatable
to
me
as
it
warmed
a
little
more
of
a
malt
hint
came
out
to
take
the
edge
off
the
bitter
hops
i
just
may
not
be
so
familiar
with
this
style
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
too
high
on
my
list
if
you
like
the
style
you
could
drink
this
one
all
night
quite
a
winner
from
big
sky
drinkability
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
i
purchased
i
enjoyed
the
three
that
i
had
and
would
gladly
trade
the
summer
honey
ale
for
three
more
of
these
a
good
apa
that
i
would
purchase
again
easy
drinking
not
particularly
distinctive
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
tawny
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
after
settling
the
head
stays
around
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
leaving
behind
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
not
an
overly
fragrant
apa
but
there
is
a
noticable
hop
presence
followed
by
a
yeasty
malty
smell
the
taste
has
a
nice
maltiness
with
a
sweet
swallow
its
moderately
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
the
abv
for
this
beer
seems
low
compared
to
others
in
the
style
and
doesnt
leave
the
warmth
in
the
throat
that
ive
come
to
associate
with
pale
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
certainly
nothing
you
can
chew
on
not
the
most
aggressive
apa
but
very
thirstquenching
and
easy
to
drink
d
overall
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
drinkability
wonderful
wonderful
wonderful
wonderful
on
this
hot
humid
late
summer
atlanta
eve
i
could
drink
five
or
more
of
these
with
ease
if
only
i
had
more
than
the
one
i
just
consumed
overall
this
was
really
a
good
quality
light
session
beer
still
tasted
fresh
and
had
a
good
feel
i
will
definatly
have
to
try
this
again
if
i
get
the
opportunity
to
me
the
quality
that
stood
out
for
this
beer
was
the
floral
hoppy
aroma
the
scent
may
lead
one
to
think
that
this
beer
has
very
little
malt
quality
but
the
taste
was
very
balanced
the
taste
right
out
of
the
bottle
was
okay
but
was
much
better
as
it
warmed
a
tad
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
drank
it
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
was
only
marginally
impressed
but
my
opinion
changed
when
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
which
is
necessary
to
get
the
full
aroma
and
taste
id
recommend
this
one
and
hope
that
i
come
across
it
in
the
future
all
around
good
pale
ale
personally
liked
the
muted
hops
present
but
part
of
an
overall
picture
poured
an
orangecopper
color
with
medium
foam
minor
lacing
the
smell
was
of
orange
citrus
nice
balance
of
hops
and
caramel
on
the
tongue
a
little
chewy
in
the
mouth
nice
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
which
is
what
i
like
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
ale
very
well
balanced
with
a
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
and
easily
quaffable
not
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
again
a
sweet
caramel
toffee
malt
layers
the
mid
palate
with
floral
slightly
bitter
hop
balancing
the
finish
with
bready
cereal
grain
flavors
citrus
of
the
nose
is
gone
but
the
pear
is
still
traceable
finish
is
medium
length
bittersweet
drinkability
good
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
pale
ale
pairs
nicely
with
shrimp
scampi
turn
one
of
these
down
either
drinklability
quite
drinkable
and
even
sessionable
but
lacks
the
depth
of
character
to
really
keep
my
interest
just
a
couple
more
og
points
andor
a
little
less
attenuation
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
for
this
beer
d
the

is

the
thinness
of

is
not

somehow
the

is

the
big

yeast
and
thin

never
really
excites
me
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
more
so
for
the
fact
that
i
cant
really
get
montana
beer
here
in

nothing
over
the
top
but
good
for
the
style

that
never
fully
disappears
nose
has
some
floral
and

is
also
filled
with
sweetness
taste
seems
off
balance
hops
play
by
themselves
while
light
malty
sweetness
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
mouth
light
body
goes
down
quick
so
i
find
it
very
drinkable
overall
not
bad
a
nice
pale
ale
from
montana
but
suffers
from
a
little
too
much
of
a
buttery
feel
dare
i
say
too
much
d
even
notes
it
was
just
ok
i
dont
mind
a
pale
that
is
balanced
and
mellow
but
it
has
to
be
flavorful
and
interesting
and
this
falls
short
i
was
amazed
at
how
watered
and
light
the
body
is
this
brew
has
potential
but
for
now
its
barely
ok
the
smell
is
full
of
hops
that
are
soft
in
character
the
taste
starts
with
a
strong
base
of
pale
malt
which
is
overtaken
by
lasting
hop
flavor
the
balance
and
drinkability
are
both
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
pleasing
thanks
loren01
for
the
beer
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
to
a
golden
orange
color
with
offwhite
head
i
enjoyed
the
initial
aroma
of
this
a
hoppy
smell
of
grass
and
floral
scents
flavor
continued
the
floral
and
grass
along
with
pine
unfortunately
the
finish
was
extremely
unpleasant
completely
dominated
by
these
flavors
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
chewing
on
grass
and
sucking
on
flowers
the
very
dry
floralgrass
palate
completely
ruined
this
beer
that
started
out
promising
overall
a
mildly
hoppy
beer
with
decent
malt
backbone
and
lingering
hop
flavor
on
the
tongue
a
nice
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
probably
typical
of
a
craft
apa
but
very
drinkable
and
pleasing
especially
on
a
hot
july
afternoon
ill
have
scape

again

if
its

d
pretty
good
pale
ale
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
of
my
favorites
from
big
sky
d
this
beer
has
some
light
caramel
malt
notes
that
are
a
bit
off
and
the
hops
are
mostly
bittering
hops
with
not
much
depth
american
pas
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
so
i
get
very
picky
when
sampling
them
scapegoat
is
average
across
the
board
for
me
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
pretty
refreshing
and
has
a
decent
dry
flavor
i
feel
like
it
lack
pizzazz
though
it
could
use
some
diversity
in
malt
in
hops
shining
bronze
color
with
a
fully

hops
earth

with
the
hops
being
the
most
accented
of
the
two
i
generally
dont
enjoy
english
pales
ales
unless
its
a
spectacular
recipe
and
this
is
no
different
i
dislike
how
the
hops
give
off
such
an
herbal
sometimes
medicinal
flavor
the
hops
here
taste
like
antibiotics
to
me
totally
unpleasant
maybe
its
the
crystal
i
dont
know
yet
not
much
malt
and
hop
balance
to
begin
with
and
the
hop

over
a
mildly
cloudy

highligher
colored
liquid
smells
of
oranges
with
mild
grapefruit
and
honey
not
much
in
the
nose
actually
and
any
malt
sweet
or
fruity
esters
are
too
subtle
for
me
to
pick
up
not
a
promising
start
tastes
of
an
interesting
hoppy
jumble
but
again
the
malt
and
esters
are
nearly
absent
more
hop
flavored
than
hop
bittered
which
is
appropriate
for
an
apa
hops
are
pithy
grapefruit
oranges
and
some
tangerine
none
are
distinctly
dominant
as
they
mix
aroudn
one
appearing
and
then
slipping
beneath
the
other
before
rising
again
the
gpith
is
likely
the
most
noticable
caramel
in
the
malt
which
is
actually
a
bit
dry
a
little
bit
of
tang
and
sour
not
green
apple
flavored
but
catches
your
attention
like
a
good
sour
apple
some
sweet
esters
do
temper
the
caramel
dry
a
little
bit
of
butter
in
the
aftertaste
pulls
the
beer
downward
mdlight
body
and
moderately
carbonated
some
dextrinous
quality
about
the
mouthfeel
thats
pleasing
and
imo
really
helps
the
simple
flavors
of
this
beer
work
positively
nice
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
body
is
light
and
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
some
slickness
in
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
light
but
ok
overall
a
limited
beer
but
easy
drinking
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
grapefruity
note
a
lot
of
flavour
for
an
apa
and
thats
a
good
thing
because
i
know
ill
buy
this
one
again
thanks

for
bringing
this
beaut
back

drink
this
one
cold
as
it
does
not
improve
as
gets
warm
i
tried
one
at
55
and
it
didnt
taste
so
great
right
out
of
the
fridge
hit
the
spot
great
for
times
when
you
want
a
really
light
beer
with
full
flavor
i
dig
this
the
only
pale
ale
that
trumps
this
is
poleeko
gold
but
that
one
usually
costs
more
and
is
stronger
this
will
become
a
staple
for
me
if
i
can
keep
getting
it
for
6
bucks
a
sixer
i
do
not
really
have
that
much
different
to
say
from
my
initial
review
except
that
this
serving
style
struck
me
as
being
hoppier
plus
there
was
greater
clarity
hopefully
brevity
is
all

of

i
will
tell
you
one
thing
about
this
bottle
style
albeit
simplistic
the
palate
is
dry
upfront
it
seems
deadon
for
this
beer
as
a
whole
this
is
a
very
good

brew
and
it

be
something
id
quaff
often
if
it
were


the
funny
flavors
that
i
found
will
probably
keep
me
from
buying
again
could
pack
a
bit
more
flavor
light
on
the
malt
with
an
obvious
citric
hop
one
thing
going
for
this
beer
is
that
the
brewers
did
a
good
job
at
keeping
it
balanced
and
making
it
quite
drinkable

after

dry
theres
a
good
enough
malt
backbone
i
remember
this
being
a
tasty
not
very
hopped
but
easy
drinking
pale
ale
on
tap
at
my
local
pub
the
best
option
in
a
sea
of
macro
water
disguised
as
beer
i
had
a
few
pints
so
one
would
think
i
could
give
a
detailed
account
but
this
is
not
a
particularly
memorable
beer
that
means
it
has
little
bit
weak
smell
well
nice
beer
to
me
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
for
sure
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
just
too
watery
for
my
criticism
but
really
refreshing
get
you
hands
on
this
beer
definitely
worth
it
enjoy
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
what
i
would
call
a
pale
ale
more
like
a
esb
with
hops
and
balance
removed
could
be
a
good
intro
beer
got
this
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
the
aroma
has
very
over
powering
caramel
smell
i
could
not
detect
any
malt
or
hops
through
the
caramel
the
taste
has
the
same
overpowering
taste
of
caramel
aftertaste
lingered
forever
and
i
found
it
very
unpleasant
this
is
not
a
pale
ale
after
a
couple
a
sips
i
could
not
drink
anymore
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
every
tried
would
work
better
as
a
brown
ale
overall
not
sure
what
an
english
bay
pale
ale
is
supposed
to
be
but
this
is
a
nice
very
toasty
slightly
sweet
pale
ale
overall
pretty
standard
and
enjoyable
pale
ale
very
impressed
with
this
beer
based
on
how
average
it
is
had
a
pint
on
tap
at
a
calgary
pub
in
the
ne
arrived
a
nice
reddish
bronze
color
with
around
an
inch
and
a
half
of
offwhite
head
subtle
aroma
was
decidedly
fruity
with
a
little
malt
macintosh
apple
and
pear
along
with
a
little
caramel
aroma
intensity
did
improve
as
the
beer
warmed
up
palate
was
also
on
the
subdued
and
mellow
side
with
some
brown
bread
brown
sugar
and
again
a
lot
of
apple
and
pear
fruit
nil
citrus
that
i
could
discern
and
the
malts
were
there
but
decidedly
downplayed
the
english
malt
complexity
crucial
to
this
style
is
present
but
you
have
to
go
looking
for
it
finish
quite
crisp
and
dry
with
appropriate
earthy
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
little
lingering
treacle
sweetness
insufficient
body
a
workmanlike
effort
that
comes
off
as
unfinished
or
insufficiently
conditioned
due
to
all
the
applepear
esters
trumping
the
malts
on
the
palate
decided
devoid
of
all
the
west
coast
character
promised
on
the
label
and
instead
tastes
like
a
small
beer
from
across
the
atlantic
granville
island
is
a
lot
like
big
rock
here
in
alberta
they
rarely
produce
terrible
offerings
but
they
do
not
typically
blow
anyones
mind
either
theres
probably
a
certain
comfort
in
just
barely
clearing
the
mediocrity
bar
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
however
for
the
price
better
beers
in
the
style
are
usually
available
overall
a
little
better
than
expected
and
good
drinkability
o
overall
english
bay
is
straightforward
in
a
way
that
goes
beyond
just
being
liniear
its
basic
and
doesnt
really
have
a
lot
to
offer
overall
this
is
probably
the
worst
english
style
pale
ale
i
have
ever
had
west
coast
inspired
ummmm
not
in
the
least
served
out
of
a
bottle
at
niagara
food
fest
as
mentioned
by
other
users
an
unremarkable
pale
ale
too
sweet
and
nothing
that
would
generally
bring
me
back
however
this
is
one
of
the
very
few
beers
that
you
can
find
in
ontario
bars
and
restaurants
thats
not
a
molson
or
labatt
product
im
continually
frustrated
by
ontario
establishments
who
dont
see
the
value
in
offering
quality
crafts
so
whenever
i
see
this
beer
i
buy
it
for
myself
and
for
anyone
around
me
i
guess
its
my
attempt
at
spreading
the
craft
word
and
trying
to
open
ontarians
minds
a
bit
its
a
long
haul
but
maybe
eventually
well
see
more
selection
so
dont
over
think
this
brew
when
you
see
it
as
the
only
craft
available
in
an
ontario
establishment
see
it
as
a
marginal
step
in
the
right
direction
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
clear
amber
with
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
maple
and
ripe
fruit
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
ripe
fruit
and
earthy
hops
finish
is
medium
lasting
and
semidry
average
pale
ale
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
far
too
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
and
is
lacking
in
hops
its
a
little
interesting
but
its
all
over
the
place
so
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
regularly
its
ok
but
there
are
better
offerings
from
granville
o
the
mouthfeel
really
helps
carry
this
beer
the
flavour
is
light
but
i
found
nothing
offensive
about
this
one
o
overall
im
not
impressed
by
the
beer
options
here
in
ontario
drinkable
compared
to
the
fizzy
yellow
stuff
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
overal
35
o
a
real
disappointing
watery
beer
sort
of
like
it
love
the
can
and
the
fact
its
from
canada
but
it
is
watery
tea
like
and
not
flavourful
overall
a
fairly
tasty
pale
ale
by
granville
with
a
good
caramalt
backbone
this
brew
has
some
characteristics
that
lean
towards
the
epa
classification
rather
than
an
apa
not
something
id
buy
frequently
but
i
can
see
a
specific
type
of
beer
fan
loving
it
probably
the
weakest
beer
in
their
mix
pack
this
pale
ale
has
no
hops
whatsoever
pours
a
clear
caramel
colour
with
one
fingers
worth
of
head
that
barely
lasts
smells
of
sweet
malts
biscuits
and
cinnamon
tastes
more
biscuit
than
the
smell
medium
body
mouthfeel
and
kind
of
dry
in
the
finish
a
beer
i
will
not
be
seeking
a
sixer
of
but
if
they
served
it
at
the
bar
id
drink
it
had
this
for
the
first
time
a
few
weeks
ago
first
of
any
granville
beer
i
found
it
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
poured
nice
with
a
copper
color
with
a
sweet
cirtusy
taste
well
balanced
the
bartender
said
they
were
trying
hard
to
get
some
other
granville
products
in
as
this
one
was
being
well
recieved
by
those
who
tried
it
overall
a
rather
simple
and
decent
brew
but
not
much
going
on
either
overall
dont
seek
out
this
beer
have
rickyards
blonde
overall
american
pa
it
is
not
its
more
along
the
lines
of
a
esb
and
not
a
very
good
one
at
that
the
taste
is
boring
and
its
a
little
too
thinwatery
i
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
pale
amber
colour
with
a
little
bit
of
head
but
very
little
lacing
smell
is
average
and
taste
is
good
nothing
really
sticks
out
just
a
good
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
after
taste
is
smooth
decent
beer
but
not
great
as
it
could
use
a
little
more
flavour
not
much
pale
ale
about
this
at
all
a
poor
effort
macrostyle

mild

clean
medium

medium

ok
mouthfeel
quite
the
average
beer
while
its
not
bad
i
find
myself
very
indifferent
to
this
i
could
drink
this
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
though
this
has
a
flavour
of
light
caramelized
malts
quite
light
on
the
palate
slightly
watery
refreshing
flavour
but
could
be
more
interesting
bit
of
fruitiness
as
well
mouthfeel
felt
a
bit
lacking
flavour
was
alright
and
drinkable
but
didnt
really
showcase
itself
as
anything
special
overall
a
decent
brew
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
but
very
sessionable
update
retried
this
on
8192012
via
molsons
handpicked
6
sampler
pack
and
was
a
bit
less
impressed
than
last
time
so
i
lowered
the
score
a
bit
the
aroma
is
a
bit
bland
and
the
mouthfeel
is
less
creamymore
watery
than
i
remember
not
planning
to
revisit
this
one
unless
i
happen
upon
a
tap
somewhere
english
or
american
its
a
pretty
mediocre
pale
ale
either
way
od
average
interesting
and
ok
for
the
style
easty
drinking
but
not
exciting
better
than
i
expected
looks
pretty
good
amberbrown
with
a
nice
ivory
head
smell
reveals
some
sweet
crapiness
sorry
but
not
a
fan
like
light
molasses
and
corn
sugar
thats
what
comes
to
mind
anyways
taste
isnt
much
better
thanks
again
uncle
pat
tasted
perfect
along
side
my
burger
and
overall
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
ooverall
this
beer
was
decent
i
would
grab
it
again
a
thoroughly
unimpressive
beer
that
meanders
somewhere
between
a
brown
ale
an
amber
and
an
american
pale
ale
the
metallicsour
finish
and
aftertaste
are
enough
to
keep
me
from
buying
it
again
d
i
really
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
still
although
it
seems
to
possess
a
really
inconsistent
quality
from
bottletobottle
i
still
enjoy
it
every
time
it
really
tastes
incredibly
simple
without
much
complexities
at
all
but
something
about
the
malty
flavor
just
appeals
to
me
so
much
more
like
a
nut
brown
ale
than
a
pale
ale
needs
more
hops
nonetheless
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
decent
pale
ale
probably
tastes
better
on
site
but
then
again
what
wouldnt
this
is
a
beer
that
just
is
there
isnt
a
single
way
in
which
it
stands
out
d
very
drinkable
but
you
dont
sit
and
ponder
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
has
decent
drinkability
but
no
outstanding
characteristics
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
while
in
vancouver
now
back
to
more
red
racer
ipa
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
the
body
is
to
light
kind
of
waters
down
the
rest
of
the
taste
still
worth
a
try
easy
to
drink
when
reading
beer
reviews
a
book
playing
xbox
ect
there
is
no
need
to
sit
down
and
search
for
complexitys
great
easy
to
drink
beer
d
a
very
average
drink
seems
to
be
a
more
all
purpose
offering
in
terms
of
light
flavour
and
carbonation
goes
down
easy
but
not
sure
i
would
invest
more
time
that
one
d
the
flavours
on
this
one
were
quite
nice
perfectly
balanced
creating
a
tasty
experience
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
on
any
granville
islands
offerings
and
apart
from
the
slight
turnoff
on
carbonation
this
one
was
very
delicious
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
caramel
maybe
a
hint
of
toffee
taste
is
good
caramel
and
hops
very
flavorful
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
brew
had
this
at
joe
fortes
restaurant
on
a
recent
trip
to
vancouver
poured
copper
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
and
great
lacing
decent
amount
of
biscuit
and
malt
in
the
nose
but
not
much
else
the
taste
revealed
biscuit
toast
and
walnut
but
not
much
fruitiness
or
hoppiness
not
much
of
a
finish
either
not
much
carbonation
in
the
feel
but
it
was
smooth
and
the
nice
head
retention
added
a
subtle
creaminess
to
it
decent
session
beer
but
definitely
needs
a
more
robust
flavor
profile
my
day
leaving
vancouver
was
not
a
good
beer
tasting
day
but
it
seems
all
english
to
me
with
the
woody
and
caramel
notes
dominating
the
scene

not
what
i
usually
expect
from
a
pale

this
isnt

was
expecting
more
taste
is
similar
with
light

some

coppery

a
bit
more

and
less
hoppy
than
id
expect
from
a
pale
ale
im
noticing
that
granville
island
does
that
with
quite
a
few
of
its
ales
i
think
that
might
be
one
reason
i
really
like

not
quite
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
pale
yet
going
back
shortly
after
i
couldnt
pick
up
anything
at
all
flavour
is
quite
bland
looks
good
but
not
tasty
a
fun
brew
and
certainly
one
to
keep
in
mind
every
year
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
that
aftertaste
that
throws

overall
the

but
other
than
that
this
was
a
fairly
unbalanced
and
slightly
off
putting
brew
not
one
i
will
go
to
again
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
spice
such
as
pepper
to
it
as
well
as
pear
and
apple
scents
the
taste
starts
off
strong
with
dark
fruits
like
plum
and
apple
with
pepper
and
vanilla
flavors
coming
in
at
the
end
the
alcohol
flavor
was
definitely
there
but
was
not
overpowering
to
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
little
forgettable
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
010213
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
definitely
like
aventinus
little
sibling
less
sweet
a
tad
more
toasty
but
having
seen
the
light
it
reflects
a
bit
dim
a
decent
english
pale
its
big
on
the
herbal
hops
and
buttery
malts
which
is
always
kind
of
an
eh
flavor
combo
for
me
but
really
not
a
bad
beer
overall
it
is
a
pretty
decent
english
pale
ale
the
body
was
full
and
even
and
not
quite
full
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
easily
drain
a
couple
bottles
of
this
overall
a
very
good
beer
certainly
worth
grabbingif
you
see
it
perhaps
even
a
bit
of
effort
to
find
very
bad
elf
is
actually
very
easy
to
drink
subtle
layers
of
citrus
and
toffee
sweetness
without
the
chalkiness
you
might
expect
from
an
english
pale
quite
balanced
and
smooth
but
i
noticed
the
tightly
wrapped
layers
loosen
up
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
drink
cold
overall
classic
english
pale
solid
allaround
its
not
worth
the
high
asking
price
78
for
approx
17
ounces
considering
it
is
at
best
a
very
good
but
not
remarkable
epa
i
got
it
at
closeout
for
2
99
though
so
i
cant
be
too
miffed
it
had
a
fresh
taste
and
was
very
drinkable
we
will
be
sampling
several
other
elves
soon
including
a
well
aged
barleywine
based
on
this
i
really
look
forward
to
that
treat
honey
amber
color
some
bready
yeasty
aromas
the
initial
taste
was
sweetened
grapefruit
then
a
bit
of
fruity
anise
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
an
english
ipa
as
it
approached
a
dubbellike
quality
it
didnt
warm
well
the
flavors
became
muddled
still
a
good
tasting
beer
at
a
decent
price
a
pretty
decent
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
i
have
no
problems
with
it
glad
to
have
it
wouldnt
turn
it
down
in
the
future
drinks
pretty
easy
given
its
slightly
aboveaverage
abv
d
not
my
favorite
but
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
wouldnt
you
know
it
very
bad
elf
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
youd
think
a
higher
gravity
version
of
bad
elf
would
be
it
has
aromas
of
pithy
citric
and
spicy
hopping
over
a
medium
leveled
booze
and
caramel
toffee
malt
component
which
also
shows
up
in
the
flavor
teamed
up
with
some
stone
fruits
reds
and
purples
and
the
same
noble
hopping
finish
teamed
up
with
some
mildly
rising
boozey
warmth
for
a
nice
level
of
dryness
o
the
look
and
buzz
are
about
the
only
highlights
of
this
brew
the
7
5
abv
is
bracing
and
warms
the
soul
on
a
wintery
night
but
it
lacks
true
complexity
or
balance
expected
in
an
english
pale
not
terrible
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
on
its
own
not
a
good
beer
definitely
expected
a
lot
more
pours
a
lucozade
colour
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
just
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
boozy
alcoholtoffee
and
dried
apricotsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
brandyxmas
cakefruity
hopscaramel
and
toffeewith
the
finish
being
quite
sweet
like
port
and
overall
its
not
bad
and
would
be
great
for
xmas
but
since
thats
over
id
say
its
a
nice
nightcap
oi
liked
the
smell
i
wish
more
of
that
carried
over
into
the
flavors
but
a
pretty
good
beer
anyway
pours
crystal
clear
coppercolored
with
minimal
carbonation
and
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malts
with
an
ample
amount
of
floral
hops
and
a
touch
of
cherry
and
raisin
fruit
the
flavor
comes
on
malty
with
grainy
bread
and
caramel
notes
just
a
hint
of
floral
fruity
hops
comes
through
the
aftertaste
is
smoky
at
the
end
overshadowed
by
a
rather
intense
bitterness
smooth
but
thin
mouthfeel
becoming
entirely
too
bitter
and
rough
with
a
strong
ethanol
burn
as
it
warms
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
copper
coloring
slightly
hazed
with
no
head
the
nose
is
a
syrupy
caramel
malt
with
toffee
highlights
very
sweet
aromas
the
beers
flavors
are
roasted
and
toasty
with
a
solid
hops
presence
in
the
backbone
that
is
peppery
and
resiny
very
well
balanced
flavors
some
highlights
of
juniper
and
berry
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
toffee
with
a
slight
hopping
and
the
finish
is
slick
and
smooth
tasty
beer
and
the
booze
presence
is
minimal
serving
more
as
a
highlight
throughout
good
brew
o
a
nice
ale
with
overall
great
drinkabilty
and
decent
complexity
a
bit
too
boozy
for
the
style
looked
very
interesting
at
first
but
somehow
i
kinda
felt
like
it
was
progressively
losing
flavour
a
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
english
ale
above
average
for
the
style
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
cask
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
so
far
poured
a
34
linen
colored
head
pretty
body
in
clear
amber
but
it
appears
to
exhaust
all
the
carbonation
into
the
head
during
pour
smells
of
malt
taste
is
malt
a
little
sweet
and
theres
a
crispness
usually
in
lagers
instead
of
ale
body
is
rich
and
creamy
quite
nice
an
unusual
but
very
british
bitter
hoppy
finish
shines
through
all
in
all
a
good
beer
im
just
not
sure
what
is
supposed
to
make
this
elf
a
bad
boy
drinkability
i
like
this
i
like
this
a
lot
the
cashier
at
the
store
said
she
liked
it
too
so
it
is
not
very
bad
after
all
o
this
was
really
boozy
and
a
little
unbalanced
o
yes
id
definitely
call
this
an
esb
the
maltiness
up
front
caramel
and
biscuit
flavors
along
with
a
good
balance
of
earthy
english
hops
speak
esb
to
me
and
this
is
a
great
example
o
this
was
ok
but
really
felt
like
it
left
me
wanting
much
more
jh
i
see
this
lineup
every
year
and
finally
decided
it
was
time
to
pick
one
up
pours
a
light
clear
mahogany
with
an
off
white
head
head
is
fizzy
disappears
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
nose
is
spicy
and
bready
very
seasonal
taste
is
very
malt
dominated
lots
of
bready
malts
with
a
nice
roasted
touch
and
a
definite
alcohol
bite
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
to
sum
it
up
its
a
good
but
not
great
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
and
i
might
again
next
year
or
even
try
some
of
the
other
variations
if
the
mood
strikes
me
one
thing
i
will
give
it
is
7
5
will
certainly
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
a
very
nice
warming
drink
for
the
winter
months
and
at
7
5
im
having
a
hard
time
writing
this
so
good
night
overall
an
average
ale
nothing
really
stands
out
d
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
bitterness
is
subdued
just
kinda
bland
i
wouldnt
pick
up
again
d
this
beer
didnt
have
much
flavor
at
all
and
the
dish
soap
flavor
was
very
offputting
and
made
it
hard
to
sip
the
other
flavors
were
very
watery
and
just
didnt
see
the
point
in
finishing
this
beer
rather
drinkable
im
finding
that
im
liking
the
ridgeway
offerings
drinkability
complex
and
good
enough
in
taste
not
too
filling
and
the
aftertaste
isnt
too
much
to
take
tastes
of
toasty
grains
sour
citrus
and
almost
raisin
like
finishes
with
a
light
alcohol
burn
fairly
plane
ale
overall
but
still
not
terrible
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
that
impressive
the
abv
is
okay
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
jump
out
at
you
a
pretty
good
english
pale
ale
more
on
the
bitter
side
than
the
typical
pale
ale
overall
not
a
bad
purchase
i
think
our
english
brothers
do
quite
well
at
brewing
i
think
it
is
enjoyable
but
perhaps
not
quite
my
style
first
of
this
kind
i
have
had
d
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
alcohol
is
a
bit
hidden
so
this
can
work
for
a
few
in
a
row
certainly
drinkable
not
overhwlemning
but
an
enjoyable
start
to
the
gift
pack
taste
is
caramelised
raisin
toast
toasty
and
raisiny
with
spiciness
and
a
rather
english
leafyfruity
quality
with
spiceytoastyraisiny
quality
up
front
followed
by
leafy
sweetsour
fruit
and
a
bittersweet
raisiny
finish
its
a
bit
interesting
and
different
and
overall
pretty
good
i
came
back
to
the
glass
after
about
15
minutes
and
when
it
was
room
temperature
and
had
been
in
the
glass
a
while
better
all
around
after
some
air
and
warmer
prior
comments
still
valid
drinkability
go
on
friends
cram
some
very
bad
elf
into
your
mouth
this
holiday
season
its
very
okay
and
a
notable
notch
above
the
lesser
bad
elf
each
year
i
avoid
working
through
the
ridgeway
christmastime
beers
like
i
avoid
mopping
the
linoleum
kitchen
floor
but
maybe
just
maybe
ill
givem
a
go
this
winter
my
first
epa
i
guess
they
arent
for
me
if
this
is
indicative
of
the
style
smooth
round
mouthfeel
caramel
flavor
with
a
pleasant
hop
finish
this
is
a
malty
beer
but
the
hop
finishes
the
beer
for
some
balance
if
i
were
blindfolded
id
guess
that
this
is
a
american
amber
overall
perception
was
that
this
basically
tasted
like
a
malty
roasted
apple
cider
with
alcohol
has
similar
balance
and
taste
to
a
cider
beer
however
this
beer
possesses
a
malty
molasseslike
backbone
that
renders
the
consistency
a
bit
more
syrupy
and
complex
in
the
mouth
d
i
enjoyed
this
epa
i
sort
of
expected
a
little
more
from
a
special
reserve
ale
but
i
was
nonetheless
pleased
with
how
drinkable
and
light
this
was
pours
an
auburn
yet
clearish
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
1
5
finger
white
head
that
slowly
receeded
w
minimal
lace
a
mix
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
along
with
light
bitterness
of
hops
citric
mostly
comprises
the
aroma
thin
to
mediumbodied
with
a
good
citricsharp
fruit
flavor
and
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
balances
with
a
good
sturdy
malt
backbone
of
bready
and
roasted
malts
for
a
slight
chewiness
and
dryness
yet
finishes
with
a
smooth
backbite
a
sessionable
epa
that
is
easygoing
but
refreshing
has
a
britishly
fruit
and
malt
feel
to
it
very
clean
and
fresh
tasting
seems
to
be
a
well
crafted
beer
i
like
it
well
balanced
and
tasty
as
it
combines
mild
hops
fruit
and
malt
flavors
into
a
easy
drinker
with
a
good
amount
of
complexity
and
hides
the
abv
well
just
give
me
a
reason
why
nikki
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
12
inch
foam
head
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
pale
malts
and
buttery
the
taste
was
malt
dominated
with
a
bitterness
that
stayed
with
you
most
of
the
drink
in
the
mouth
it
was
semi
dry
overall
not
a
bad
effort
for
a
epa
going
through
the
christmas
gift
beer
pours
bright
copper
clear
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smell
is
piney
hops
oranges
and
a
whiff
of
something
minty
the
taste
is
malty
with
nary
a
hint
of
the
hops
in
the
smell
warm
caramel
wood
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
hops
in
the
aftertaste
good
subtle
at
first
then
a
bit
more
assertive
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
substantial
drinkability
is
good
a
decent
brew
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
offwhite
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
yeast
and
caramel
malt
with
earthy
barley
and
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
light
caramel
and
barley
malts
with
sweet
yeast
and
mild
copper
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
had
a
pretty
good
and
clean
flavor
with
a
bit
more
character
than
other
ridgeway
beers
but
it
was
still
pretty
basic
it
at
least
had
a
good
body
and
was
easy
to
drink
moderately
enjoyable
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
rich
creamy
head
i
detected
a
sweet
vanilla
and
honey
aroma
which
was
really
pleasant
it
has
a
caramelhoney
flavor
and
is
slightly
malty
i
really
thought
it
had
a
great
mouthfeel
and
drank
very
easily
leaving
me
wanting
for
more
this
is
a
solid
beer
out
of
ridgeway
brewing
one
of
my
favorite
of
their
line
of
beers
notes
not
enough
dry
malt
for
my
taste
none
of
the
buttery
flavor
characteristic
of
the
style
on
the
other
hand
these
guys
make
the
alcohol
taste
good
which
takes
skill
but
its
just
not
by
kind
of
beer
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
lot
better
than
the
bad
elf
well
this
elf
isnt
very
bad
but
its
not
very
good
either
something
of
a
bland
though
not
very
might
fit
other
than
appearance
pretty
mediocreish
with
a
boozy
touch
in
my
opinion
a
gimmick
that
is
worth
trying
but
hardly
worth
repeating
nice
body
smooth
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
wont
have
a
problem
with
this
big
bottle
at
all
finish
is
warm
moderately
alcoholic
but
nonetheless
i
find
it
very
drinkable
it
had
been
given
to
me
in
a
gift
pack
and
i
was
a
bit
concerned
by
the
source
but
this
is
very
pleasant
surprise
d
nicley
balanced
malt
and
bitter
pretty
much
a
classic
english
bitter
i
consider
very
bad
elf
to
be
dangerously
close
to
very
bad
beer
ive
always
felt
christmas
to
be
a
time
to
celebrate
the
good
and
this
just
gives
me
more
reason
to
feel
that
the
bad
has
no
place
in
this
holiday
one
thing
for
sure
i
dont
think
there
will
be
any
place
in
my
fridge
for
ridgeway
brewing
next
season
baring
of
course
they
come
out
with
a
better
elf
d
decent
all
around
but
wouldnt
drink
this
in
multiples
there
is
some
presence
of
its
7
5abv
with
a
sour
tang
on
the
finish
but
overall
didnt
find
this
particularly
impressive
nothing
special
but
enjoyable
there
are
better
and
worse
beers
to
be
had
try
it
for
yourself
this
is
an
ok
beer
it
was
ok
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
the
drinkability
is
not
so
great
just
average
theis
is
not
a
brew
i
would
suggest
to
others
mk
thanks
ha
smell
needs
major
improvement
heads
abit
low
for
my
liking
golden
copper
in
colour
hides
the
abv
quite
well
lacing
is
very
nice
smooth
and
drinkable
but
lacks
that
special
something
to
make
it
stand
out
jiminy
jilikers
overall
it
was
ok
a
better
then
average
english
ale
though
i
am
just
not
that
fond
of
english
ales
i
am
sure
there
are
better
ones
out
there
though
this
was
by
no
means
terrible
i
would
be
interested
to
see
what
the
regular
bad
elf
is
like
but
the
taste
just
turns
me
off
poured
a
orange
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
some
standard
lacing
smelled
of
malts
and
some
hops
with
a
slight
sweet
fruit
coming
through
tasted
a
little
honey
but
mostly
malt
and
some
hops
this
is
the
best
out
of
all
the
ridgeway
christmas
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
sweet
creamy
feel
and
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
for
being
7
5
overall
i
liked
this
one
and
even
though
christmas
was
three
months
ago
i
still
like
this
one
for
a
cold
winter
night
a
british
pale
ale
at
7
5
alcohol
a
very
gorgeous
medium
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
of
sulfur
with
a
hint
of
orchard
fruit
and
stale
white
bread
ok
not
quite
stale
maybe
a
dry
biscuit
baked
in
the
early
morning
and
still
sitting
on
the
table
around
11am
the
flavor
and
body
is
amazingly
light
for
its
strength
more
fruit
and
dry
crumbly
biscuits
i
think
im
drinking
a
regular
british
pale
ale
here
regular
in
my
case
being
the
stronger
5
versions
they
send
over
here
a
little
alcohol
starts
showing
through
on
the
finish
ill
bet
this
would
be
a
good
joke
to
play
on
an
english
geezer
he
thinks
he
is
quaffing
his
3
8
session
bitter
but
in
reality
is
getting
tanked
off
the
very
bad
elf
now
i
know
why
this
elf
is
so
very
bad
like
getting
fooled
by
belgians
when
they
have
you
drink
a
bunch
of
duvel
and
you
think
its
pilsner
very
tasty
brew
glad
i
caught
a
break
with
a
3
cost
for
the
500ml
the
right
color
just
no
head
at
all
nothing
special
looking
abou
this
plae
ale
at
all
the
aroma
is
a
straigt
forward
biscuit
malt
with
some
mild
hopping
good
old
fashioned
english
pale
ale
smell
smells
a
little
bit
more
sweet
than
others
the
taste
is
a
dry
malt
bill
mayb
like
a
scone
ith
a
little
drop
of
honey
and
small
sprinkle
of
lemon
witha
room
temp
cup
of
tea
pretty
good
for
just
a
pale
ale
pretty
warm
for
just
a
pale
ale
too
overall
a
very
solid
beer
for
someone
who
likes
balanced
complex
flavors
not
as
impressed
as
i
was
hoping
but
at
least
i
can
say
i
tried
it
there
are
other
beverages
i
would
much
rather
pay
5
31
for
i
got
just
a
glimpse
of
the
color
it
is
orangy
or
coppery
aroma
is
not
strong
but
malty
and
spicy
rather
inviting
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
some
spice
undertones
not
strong
or
rich
but
still
pleasing
this
is
a
good
party
beer
to
sip
while
talking
with
friends
or
playing
a
game
pours
brilliantly
clear
orangeamber
with
a
small
white
head
that
lingers
as
a
small
collar
of
foam
aroma
is
earthy
english
hops
fuggles
backed
by
butterscotch
hints
of
malt
and
indications
of
higher
alcohols
possibly
fusels
warming
all
the
way
down
the
flavor
is
earthy
english
hops
up
front
quickly
matched
by
some
big
alcohol
that
is
not
offensive
but
not
quite
smooth
tail
is
all
crystal
malt
and
butterscotch
with
a
faint
hop
note
hmmmm
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
something
oh
yeah
every
ridgeway
brew
very
bad
elf
bad
elf
with
more
alcohol
in
it
pours
an
identical
color
the
nose
has
the
standard
ridgeway
funk
to
it
taste
is
of
maltiness
and
runky
almost
rotten
hops
the
alcohol
is
the
dominant
flavor
mouthfeel
is
really
thick
and
warming
the
drinkability
is
not
what
i
would
prefer
i
had
trouble
finishing
the
glass
when
it
warmed
up
not
really
impressed
with
this
line
of
elves
i
prefer
the
gnomes
of
the
ardennes
i
would
love
sitting
in
a
uk
pub
enjoying
this
beerits
definitely
good
but
the
hops
really
arent
my
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
slight
coppergolden
hue
in
the
body
and
a
nice
foamy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
for
the
rest
of
the
session
the
fuggles
come
through
in
the
aroma
the
malt
blend
is
strange
to
place
and
the
rye
make
sense
to
be
that
unfimilar
scent
the
flavor
is
unsweet
tea
bitter
a
great
mix
of
clean
and
bitter
the
body
of
the
barley
and
rye
gives
a
twang
to
the
overall
taste
that
does
linger
well
after
the
sip
the
body
is
a
good
medium
i
would
say
that
i
will
have
this
beer
least
once
a
winter
season
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
reddish
gold
color
and
the
beer
also
had
a
very
nice
head
with
very
nice
lacing
qualities
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
a
little
nutty
i
thought
the
beer
tasted
a
little
sweet
to
me
and
the
alcohol
burn
was
a
little
to
much
for
my
taste
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
will
not
buy
again
drinkability
this
is
a
fun
drinking
beer
both
tasty
and
warming
one
or
two
to
close
the
night
down
on
a
chilly
evening
i
actually
like
the
series
labels
too
nothing
spectacular
but
this
brew
is
nice
and
well
crafted
a
nice
english
ale
that
i
could
drink
for
a
session
pours
a
clean
orangeish
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
malty
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
a
sticky
malt
and
alcohol
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
gingerbread
a
malty
alcohol
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
alcohol
aftertaste
big
in
alcohol
and
a
sticky
sweet
malt
ok
but
the
name
does
more
drinkability
very
nice
beer
in
the
english
style
im
quite
impressed
d
this
is
a
perfectly
pleasant
beer
i
could
imagine
sitting
back
drinking
this
with
friends
that
said
if
i
decided
i
really
wanted
to
drink
an
english
ale
this
is
probably
not
the
one
i
would
single
out
pours

cleanclear
golden

some
carbonation
tiny

some
little
slicks
and
sticky

caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sourtangy
malty
and
lots
of

drinkable
not
a
bad

but
would
not
buy
again
the

evacuates

ive
enjoyed
all
the
beers
from
this
series
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
egg
shell
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
light
cap
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
and
some
light
leafy
hops
the
taste
is
of
strong
caramel
hops
with
woody
characteristics
some
light
leafy
hops
to
balance
out
the
brew
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
finishes
crisp
and
balanced
an
excellent
epa
good
malt
and
hop
balance
makes
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
im
surprised
that
this
ale
is
7
5
abv
i
dont
know
why
this
hasnt
been
getting
better
reviews
it
hasnt
been
rated
bad
but
this
is
one
good
ale
there
isnt
much
hop
flavor
but
that
isnt
really
expected
in
this
style
the
abv
is
maybe
a
little
high
but
its
still
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
recommended
drinkability
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
while
trying
to
decipher
tastes
could
have
used
another
one
drinkabilitynotes
pleasant
and
drinkable
example
not
bad
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head

not
very
retentive
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
floral
the
taste
is
quite
spicy
and
reminds
me
of
evergreen
the
malt
is
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
off
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
reminds
me
of
the
holiday
season
the
very
bad
elf
came
in
a
half
liter
brown
bottle
and
looked
quite
good
when
poured
with
a
clear
orange
amber
body
soft
but
steady
carbonation
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
very
subdued
and
was
a
little
bit
like
soaked
wood
chips
the
taste
was
sweetsour
and
somewhat
metallic
the
hops
were
perfumey
and
earthy
the
flavors
were
not
quite
well
melded
and
seemed
to
present
a
discordant
note
from
time
to
time
the
mouthfeel
however
was
quite
good
with
a
creamy
soft
silky
quality
this
was
obtained
at
a
clearance
sale
from
my
local
package
store
and
at
that
price
it
was
a
good
deal
i
am
not
sure
i
would
ever
pick
it
up
for
its
own
sake
again
was
fun
to
try
and
want
to
try
the
other

consider
my
taste
and
palate
to
be
pretty
sophistacted
and
wellrounded
since
i
started
thinking
about
and
reviewing
the
beer
i
drank
even
though
this
ale
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
im
glad
that
i
got
a
shot
to
rate
this
its
neither
brash
nor
understated
and
for
the
abovenovice
drinker
its
certainly
worth
a
try
once
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
laugh
at
the
name
and
enjoy
the
introspection
within
d
drinkable
but
nothing
jaw
dropping
fun
and
enjoyable
for
the
season
thats
bout
it
cheers
poured

500ml
bottle
with
no

into
a
pint
glass
had
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
hard
pour
there
was
about
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipated
with
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
alright
just
not
very
exciting
this
is
4th
beer
from
the
holiday
sampler
and
all
four
had
been
average
at
best
great
marketing
average
beer
skip
this
one
and
buy
something
better

i
really
dig
this
good
drinkabilitywould
be
more
drinkable
if
not
for
the
tartsour
tastewhich
wasnt
real
appealing
to
me
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
special
pours
a
clear
copper
amber
color
with
a
short
offwhite
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
quite
fruity
with
additional
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
alcohol
which
becomes
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
taste
begins
with
a
sugary
sweetness
along
with
some
maple
syrup
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
apple
cherry
and
fig
some
mineral
notes
are
also
apparent
bittering
hops
are
present
in
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
everything
is
good
about
this
beer
except
the
taste
and
the
elf
i
guess
its
just
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
in
the
end
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
seems
off
and
i
feel
like
the
aftertaste
overly
dominates
the
taste
experience
seems
to
have
some
of
the
same
smell
and
tastes
that
a
christmas
ale
might
alcohol
does
produce
some
warming
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
its
ok
just
doesnt
have
anything
that
makes
me
want
to
try
it
again
definitely
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
although
i
did
gain
another
bottle
with
a
label
of
an
xmas
elf
acting
impish
cute
drinkability
is
hindered
by
alcohol
notes
if
you
like
the
lighter
english
ales
like
boddingtons
you
may
like
this
but
for
me
it
kind
of
leaves
a
lessthanideal
taste
in
the
mouth
and
for
that
reason
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
for
the
taste
there
are
plenty
of
better
english
ales
out
there
however
the
label
and
the
whole
series
of
bad
elf
ales
makes
it
a
decent
novelty
gift
to
bring
to
a
holiday
party
and
its
really
not
all
that
bad
a
beer
drinkability
very
average
at
best
bought
it
for
a
holiday
party
and
friends
were
not
overly
impressed
either
not
a
bad
beverage
certainly
is
enjoyable
sad
to
say
the
bottle
is
the
best
part
about
this
beer
quite
festive
i
do
say
worth
a
try
but
i
will
not
purchase
another
one
overall
definitely
an
english
ale
hits
the
spot
nicely
but
certainly
not
an
alltime
great
volume
7

very
good
lastly
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
gearys
hampshire
special
ale
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
copper
very
thin
white
head
pretty
average
nose
is
alocohol
and
grain
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
more
grainy
corn
and
alochol
mouth
is
actually
pretty
good
a
bit
foamy
drinkability
is
just
average
cheers
after
just
having
the
bad
elf
this
brew
seems
to
have
a
very
similar
hop
profile
showing
big
earthy
and
pine
flavors
and
aromas
however
the
malt
character
shows
much
more
caramel
amber
toasty
and
malty
characters
this
seems
to
balance
the
brew
much
more
than
exhibited
in
the
bad
elf
there
seems
to
be
an
added
christmas
spice
character
that
shows
some
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
allspice
the
body
seems
more
firm
with
the
bolder
grains
but
may
be
similar
the
finish
is
a
much
more
balanced
blend
of
malts
to
hops
even
the
extra
alcohols
seem
equally
well
hidden
as
in
the
bad
elf
good
brew
and
i
do
prefer
this
one
over
the
lesser
bad
elf
very
bad
elf
indeed
im
tempted
to
upend
this
one
into
the
sink
overall
a
solid
good
beer
a
great
break
from
the
double
ipas
ive
been
drinking
lately
the
best
english
pale
ale
i
have
tasted
ok
so
i
havent
tried
very
many
now
i
understand
what
harp
is
trying
to
do
very
happy
with
it
drinkability
nothing
to
complain
about
a
very
drinkable
yet
strong
beer
i
recommend
it

9
ounce

this
beast
was
very
ellusive
i
searched
for
months
to
find
it
and
got
it
yesterday
so
i
could
try
the
trilogy

but
not
noticably
sweet

nondescript

mdlight

and
md
carbonation
sorry
this
review
is
so
short
but
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
overall
i
give
this
beer
respect
but
i
dont
think
i
will
get
it
again
had
this
one
very
recently
while
visiting
a
few
good
friends
it
pours
a
clear
amberorange
color
with
a
disappointingly
slight
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
and
herbal
theres
notable
apple
and
pear
with
an
slightly
yeasty
ale
smell
a
bit
estery
theres
also
a
bit
of
woody
earthiness
and
subtle
malt
in
the
aroma
this
is
a
moderately
sweet
beer
with
a
medium
body
and
just
a
little
carbonation
it
works
together
pretty
well
a
nice
hoppiness
creeps
in
at
the
end
with
a
little
spicy
touch
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
and
quite
drinkable
brew
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
pretty
light
almost
watery
on
the
palate
the
beer
has
a
week
finish
that
is
a
bit
astringent
and
perhaps
even
a
bit
vegetal
there
is
a
definite
fruitiness
here
that
reminds
me
of
currants
berries
and
a
bit
of
raisins
i
really
cant
get
over
the
finish
of
this
beer
though
it
is
just
bad
and
downright
unenjoyable
i
am
definitely
disappointed
by
this
beer

alcohol
very
well

and
pretty

drinkable
notes
the
name
implies
it
should
be
bad
as
in
good
but
this
just
barely
kicks
up
a
mellow
style
and
in
the
end
the
name
very
average
elf
comes
to
mind
weak
all
around
way
too
light
and
delicate
of
a
beer
to
have
an

overpowered
everything
else
i
paid

about

a
clear

catch
up
to
you
by
the

enjoyable
and
rather
drinkable
christmas
offering
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
to
spend
the
night
with
but
nothing

than
very
bad
clear
darker

color
pale
head
of
about

of
an
inch

and
with
a
white
hue
to
it

aroma
seems
fairly
hopped
with
some
apple
skin
qualities
mouthfeel
is
in
the
medium
range
carbonation
on
the
understated
side
but
still
with
some
life
the
taste
doesnt
match
the
aroma
it
exhibits
sweet
pumpkin
and
squash
with
maple
rather
broad
from
front
to
back
flattens
at
the
back
with
some
chalky
bitterness
and
a
light
pine
sense
alcohol
is
decently
hidden
but
asserts
by
the
end
of
the
imperial
pint
glass
for
all
the
fuss
about
bad
elf
labels
for
these
beers
they
really
arent
particularly
notable
in
defining
characters
for
me
copper
in
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
a
nutty
buttery
spicy
aroma
takes
over
some
caramel
is
in
there
underneath
taste
is
really
strong
on
the
nutty
flavors
some
roasted
nuts
but
really
more
of
a
salty
nut
flavor
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
really
lets
this
beer
down
from
its
potential
light
fruits
and
spices
around
but
they
never
really
come
forth
a
light
buttery
taste
is
in
there
as
well
mineral
finish
is
not
good
at
first
but
i
got
used
to
it
and
started
to
enjoy
it
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
cool
label
and
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
great
this
is
an
odd
but
interesting
beer
very
fruity
slightly
sweet
with
strong
notes
of
apples
and
raisins
a
pretty
good
alcohol
kick
finishes
off
this
good
holiday
beer
recommended
this
went
straight
from
the
importer
to
wholesaler
to

to
me
within
a
fortnight
old

beer
with
a
short

topping

lemon
peel
hashish
brandied

rather
than

threedimensional
space
clean
and
clear
satisfying
roasted
bitter
nut
tannins
embrace
the
sweet
finish
sample
from
wfm
these
holidaygimmick
beers
always
seem
to
be
below
average
and
this
is
no
exception
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
vaguely
sweet
malt
and
caramel
medium
bodied
and
a
little
watery
with
malt
and
fruit
flavors
some
bitterness
as
well
but
it
is
distracting
more
than
anything
the
finish
is
metallic
and
lightly
bitter
not
worth
going
back
to
its
not
very
bad
but
its
not
very
good
either
pours
a
very
light
amber
color
with
copper
hues
and
just
a
tiny
white
head
a
firm
dosage
of
bready
like
aromas
and
spicy
limey
hops
make
up
the
nose
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
initially
fairly
sweet
up
front
and
then
hits
with
a
decent
dosage
of
biscuity
pilsner
and
bready
like
malts
the
finish
is
fairly
spicy
with
a
sweet
citrusy
lime
hop
flavor
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
classic
pilsner
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
light
body
to
it
overall
this
brew
in
no
way
reminds
me
of
a
pale
ale
and
just
doesnt
hit
the
spot
for
me
has
a
hefetripple
sort
of
nose
with
banana
and
cloves
in
the
background
but
a
sulfery
ester
comes
out
up
front
the
sulfer
seems
to
mellow
over
time
but
it
is
still
unpleasant
its
a
solid
copper
color
and
theres
very
little
head
very
thin
bodied
pronounced
alcohol
flavor
with
some
sweetness
caramel
light
citrus
very
unbalanced
flavors
i
could
not
finish
this
one
down
the
drain
it
goes
mouthfeel
is
not
too
shabby
i
get
a
feel
for
the
7
alcohol
it
is
offering
right
away
and
much
of
teh
carbonation
is
burned
away
by
it
carbonation
is
a
bit
stingy
when
i
first
sip
it
but
then
the
alcohol
takes
over
and
in
a
way
smooths
it
out
a
little
leaving
a
slight
alcohol
tingle
during
the
swallow
however
another
example
of
a
middleoftheroad
hoppy
beer
that
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
very
bad
elf
isnt
very
good
beer
but
calling
it
good
doesnt
do
it
justice
even
though
i
cant
quite
recall
my
bottle
of
bad
elf
from
last
year
it
seems
as
though
this
more
illbehaved
brother
has
upped
the
ante
and
is
a
better
beer
for
it
if
the
pattern
holds
we
can
only
hope
that
ridgeway
continues
to
locate
increasingly
evil
elves
who
brew
increasingly
beatific
beer
this
is
pretty
good
even
is
the
nonvery
version
was
superior
drinkability
tasty
enough
to
have
another
even
at
7
5
abv
but
the
bad
elf
has
more
depth
and
flavor
this
showed
up
as
a
rather
gimmicky
trilogy
at
my
local
store
along
with
santas
butt
and
lump
of
coal
and
of
the
three
i
liked
this
the
best
the
flavor
profile
was
somewhere
between
an
english
pale
ale
and
an
esb
sturdy
caramel
malt
with
a
touch
of
vinious
alcohol
in
the
background
finish
was
a
bit
sweet
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
bit
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
smell
was
of
some
hoppy
spicyness
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
excellent
with
sweet
malts
the
beginning
fading
into
a
nice
bananna
flavor
then
finishing
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
mothfeel
is
very
smooth
slightly
carbonated
and
crisp
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
some
more
next
time
i
see
it
a
deceptive
beer
with
a
higher
abv
nose
was
spicy
cinnamon
malty
and
a
tad
fruity
appearance
was
a
medium
copper
with
an
initially
nice
head
that
remained
as
a
coating
of
froth
taste
is
differentlightly
sweet
on
the
front
alcohol
in
the
middleand
and
a
nice
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
overall
is
smooth
and
light
to
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
very
nice
for
7
5
abv
has
some
winter
warmer
qualities
this
one
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
that
actually
sticks
around
very
well
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
a
very
suble
hop
fuggles
that
has
a
grapefruit
character
the
flavor
is
very
nice
and
well
balanced
it
has
a
nice
malt
backbone
but
this
is
a
malt
that
im
not
familiar
with
i
like
it
finish
is
slightly
dry
oddly
enough
this
beer
seems
weaker
than
the
bad
elf
perhaps
they
should
swap
the
two
labels
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
wtih
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
quarter
inch
over
the
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
fruity
esters
in
it
along
with
some
light
caramel
the
flavor
is
really
different
from
other
beers
ive
had
its
similar
to
the
nose
slightly
caramel
and
a
touch
of
artificial
strawberry
the
hop
comes
through
on
the
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
the
feel
is
moderate
just
where
it
should
be
drinkability
is
just
okay
as
well
the
fruity
flavors
are
not
really
what
i
look
for
overall
an
okay
beer
but
i
liked
the
bad
elf
better

i

im
a

the

theres
lots

and
finally
a
smack
of

bitterness
the
finish
is
fairly
long
and
bitter
this
is
a
very
hearty
ale
thats
a
bit
strong
its
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
would
like
it
be
but
its
not
bad
id
like
a
touch
more
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
a
clean
dark
orangeamber
ale
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
a
citrusy
hop
aroma
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
background
the
flavor
starts
out
sweet
malty
then
slides
into
a
hop
citrus
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
nice
smooth
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
tho
not
agressive
get
and
keep
your
attention

a

drinkability

completely
after

minutes
with
some
chunky
lace
left
on
the

taste
fades
into
banana
and
the
alcohol
stays
hidden
on
further
sips
overall
a
worthwhile
beer
for
any
time
of
the
year
drinkability
is
solid
if
not
spectacular
decent
example
of
a
winter
warmer
although
could
have
used
a
bit
more
oomph
andor
complexity
pretty
onedimensional
last
christmas
i
got
to
try
the
bad
elf
so
i
figured
id
give
the
big
brother
a
try
this
christmas
beer
season
appearance
pours
amber
orange
hue
forms
a
decent
sized
head
not
very
resilient
leaves
specks
of
lacing
down
my
pint
aroma
caramel
malt
base
with
some
warm
biscuit
notes
as
well
herbal
flowery
hops
thrown
in
the
mix
doesnt
strike
me
as
really
hoppy
taste
good
mix
definitely
one
of
the
hoppier
english
pales
ive
tried
pine
and
flower
flavors
come
of
through
the
english
hop
dose
nice
malt
presence
pretty
balanced
for
being
very
bad
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
medium
to
light
bodied
drinkability
this
one
was
worth
a
try
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
imbibe
not
a
beer
that
blew
me
away
but
solid
hoppy
english
pale
its
a
new
xmas
tradition
this
beer
pours
a
mild
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
the
aroma
is
piney
and
slightly
alcolic
the
taste
is
full
malt
with
some
alcohol
notes
in
the
back
with
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
would
have
liked
some
spice
or
deep
malt
flavor
for
a
christmas
ale
overall
like
a
bass
beer
plus
malt
profile
and
alcohol
this
beer
pours
orangeamber
with
a
one
finger
head
on
the
pour
it
has
no
retention
or
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
citruspine
with
hints
of
sweet
malt
coming
through
there
is
a
good
malt
base
in
this
beer
and
you
can
tell
from
the
first
sip
but
its
the
spicypiney
bitterness
in
the
finish
thats
most
memorable
this
is
a
hearty
ale
thats
well
balanced
and
i
plan
on
picking
up
more
of
them
overall
a
great
session
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
ive
had
a
lot
of
hop
and
malt
monsters
lately
so
i
enjoyed
something
that
was
more
easy
going
but
still
tasty
and
definitely
balanced
o
a
decent
session
beer
worth
drinking
not
amazing
by
any
means
but
if
you
like
the
one
and
only
then
its
a
good
beer
to
get
into
i
wasnt
begging
for
another
but
i
will
definitely
finish
off
the
case
i
bought
o
sub
5
puts
this
in
the
sessionable
category
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
flavor
not
what
i
expected
from
a
this
but
interesting
nonetheless
o
it
comes
as
advertised
so
my
review
really
is
subjective
i
like
to
feel
the
hops
thats
lacking
here
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
hops
tasted
pretty
much
like
the
smell
suggests
with
toasted
malt
as
well
overall
surprised
that
it
was
pretty
good
as
i
do
like
their
brown
ale
also
and
fairly
smooth
to
drink
o
its
alright
i
guess
come
to
think
of
it
this
lived
up
to
my
expectations
perfectly
by
being
completely
average
in
almost
all
aspects
among
macros
ive
had
far
worse
o
good
thing
it
was
free
id
leave
this
alone
overall
rather
crisp
and
refreshing
quite
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
too
exceptional
overall
this
beer
just
rubs
me
the
right
way
its
light
but
balanced
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
really
quite
satisfying
i
would
be
glad
to
quaff
gobs
of
it
o
may
be
a
bit
easier
on
the
american
drinker
than
the
brown
offering
i
read
that
the
original
newcastle
brown
was
considered
a
failure
by
the
formulator
because
he
hed
been
attempting
to
recreate
bass
pale
ale
this
is
much
closer
to
bass
but
id
say
a
smidge
mellower
if
you
want
simple
fairly
clean
light
on
the
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
personally
it
is
not
that
bad
tasting
o
while
not
the
worst
this
is
decently
sessionable
with
some
moderate
flavors
that
make
for
a
good
hoppy
lager
but
its
far
off
from
a
pale
ale
at
4
8
and
no
real
flavor
you
could
go
to
town
on
these
and
not
be
offended
newcastle
is
not
where
to
turn
for
an
authentic
and
delicious
session
pale
look
elsewhere
this
one
misses
the
mark
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
one
that
could
be
a
session
beer
reminds
me
of
afternoons
in
pubs
when
visiting
london
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
but
certainly
one
i
would
enjoy
if
i
came
across
it
in
a
bar
again
overall
not
great
but
decent
a
good
addition
to
their
excellent
and
world
famous
brown
ale
an
average
example
of
the
style
muted
hop
profile
alright
drinkability
got
better
as
it
warmed
past
cellar
temp
but
not
enough
to
redeem
it
this
ale
is
not
exciting
ok
average
no
real
subtlety
or
hop
flavor
no
big
flavor
arc
as
with
a
real
pale
ale
like
oskar
blues
dales
pale
ale
would
drink
only
if
everything
else
was
bud
overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
its
just
nothing
exciting
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
for
the
style
with
too
much
sweetness
and
not
enough
hops
to
counteract
the
malts
i
will
be
able
to
finish
the
six
pack
but
wont
seek
this
one
out
in
the
future
i
thought
this
had
a
malt
bias
throughout
something
i
like
the
nose
had
a
mild
caramel
hint
within
the
aroma
and
that
followed
along
within
the
mouth
flavours
hops
are
around
giving
the
beer
a
balanced
feel
but
this
is
a
semisweet
brew
which
fits
my
taste
profile
very
nicely
o
overall
it
was
a
slightly
glorified
aal
id
have
again
at
a
party
but
thats
about
it
overall
this
beer
seemed
odd
to
me
i
think
its
the
cider
smell
and
taste
that
is
throwing
me
off
5
more
bottles
to
go
well
see
how
it
drinks
out
definately
a
good
pale
ale
meh
dull
and
unimaginitive
average
flavour
and
aroma
with
some
offnotes
lurking
behind
the
scenes
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
just
another
lacklustre
alsoran
give
it
a
miss
and
buy
something
decent
instead
o
drinkable
but
not
really
noteworthy
nice
toast
flavor
it
pours
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
lofty
off
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
not
much
on
the
nose
its
kind
of
macro
tasting
with
scents
of
metal
sweet
malt
and
grain
it
tastes
like
it
smells
but
with
a
little
more
to
it
i
detected
some
grass
bread
and
more
metal
it
has
a
light
body
with
very
little
carbonation
i
probably
wont
drink
this
again
i
dont
really
know
where
they
were
going
with
this
one
o
no
thanks
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
with
a
light
bodyflavor
profile
that
is
not
too
filling
and
you
are
sick
with
bmc
then
you
may
be
pleased
with
this
one
about
as
average
as
can
be
probably
wont
have
again
pours

hint
of

and
a
hint

tastes

pale

hint

wheat
and

metallic
flavors
overall
decent
appearance
and
blend
but
aroma
and
body
were
both
hurt
by
the
adjunct
presence
it
is
very
quaffable
and
lively
if
a
little
boring
this
ale
is
clean
and
sessionable
but
hardly
memorable
a
real
bleedin
corcker
well
done
poured
this
traditional
english
pale
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
clear
copper
color
produced
a
think
white
head
poor
retention
and
left
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
herbal
hops
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
some
slight
hop
bitterness
it
starts
off
with
a
decent
dose
of
malted
grain
but
fades
quickly
and
has
some
what
of
a
watery
character
much
to
thin
for
my
liking
decent
beer
nothing
to
great
nothing
too
bad
o
this
was
fruit
and
odd
without
enough
balance
and
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
ive
always
thought
that
their
standard
brown
ale
was
sort
of
thin
and
flavorless
and
this
doesnt
really
change
my
opinion
of
the
brewery
like
their
ubiquitous
brown
brew
this
is
far
from
bad
its
just
sort
of
plain
this
also
has
a
slightly
sour
finish
and
butteryfruity
combo
that
i
didnt
really
care
for
3
285

overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
as
well
i
was
let
down
by
this
beer
the
beer
taste
skunky
i
really
do
not
know
why
or
how
come
the
aroma
is
so
much
better
than
the
taste
it
is
just
an
okay
beer
another
pretty
basic
and
fairly
standard
pale
ale
here
it
wasnt
particularly
enjoyable
and
the
smell
was
almost
undistinguishable
but
nothing
in
the
beer
was
offensive
or
harsh
just
a
little
plain
this
wasnt
a
very
good
beer
i
cant
recommend
this
one
for
any
occasion
or
pairing
taste
is
bread
dough
metal
hint
pepperyleafy
bitterness
dominating
finish
gently
with
faint
hint
of
caramelised
grain
it
is
fairly
simple
but
wellrounded
solid
balanced
and
enjoyable
my
pour
produced
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
soft
slightly
hoppy
but
with
a
good
deal
of
biscuit
malt
up
front
mouthfeel
was
likewise
rather
soft
with
flavors
of
grass
crackers
and
even
a
metallic
tang
on
the
tongue
finish
was
dry
no
question
but
i
felt
like
something
was
missing
i
had
this
on
draft
at
one
point
and
really
enjoyed
it
but
this
presentation
seemed
somehow
lacking
just
not
enough
ooomph
i
guess
amber
in
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
like
a
lot
of
these
seasonal
newcastle
releases
really
quite
buttery
a
bit
of
melon
in
there
too
bread
and
toast
with
a
touch
of
toffee
toffee
and
toasted
malt
flavors
to
this
one
which
arent
bad
but
still
a
hint
of
butter
slight
melon
notes
and
a
light
floral
hop
character
this
was
nicely
balanced
if
not
particularly
unique
id
have
another
o
a
blighty
good
brew
tastes
like
a
lighter
slightly
hoppier
newcastle
brown
refreshing
but
average
beer
that
if
youre
a
nc
brown
fan
youll
like
this
but
i
found
it
boring
drink
just
average
lacking
carbonation
and
flavor
founders
is
an
alright
ale
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
ales
but
i
am
a
big
fan
of
newcastle
so
i
had
to
try
first
and
formost
the
best
thing
i
enjoyed
about
this
was
the
mouth
feel
its
very
malty
like
in
the
mouth
worst
thing
i
hated
is
the
after
taste
too
bitter
for
me
the
overall
finish
is
okay
in
my
opinion
this
beer
taste
quite
a
bit
like
fat
tire
the
caramel
biscut
taste
is
all
up
there
front
and
center
its
worth
trying
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
ales
give
it
a
try
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
others
that
are
better
in
the
style
the
aftertaste
on
the
medium
bodied
beer
is
a
very
light
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
the
malt
remaining
in
one
word
lacklustre
taste
fits
the
bill
sweet
instead
of
bitter
mild
instead
of
robust
much
more
on
point
when
calling
oneself
a
british
pale
ale
mild
body
good
amount
of
mild
sweetness
not
diabetic
coma
inducing
but
definitely
leans
sweet
over
bitter

who
dont

hoppy

pours
bright

nice
foamy

colored
head
that
holds
some

aromas
are
earthy
musty
and
metallic
some
toasted
grain
and
herbal
hop
tastes
are
earthy
as
well
with
notes
of
toasted
grain
herbal
hops
grassy
nutty
rather
bland
with
a
metallic
finish
as
is
warms
the
sweetness
they
speak
of
comes
out
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
caramel
albeit
faint
body
is
thin
and
watery
ample
carbonation
goes
down
crisp
and
clean
overall
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
herbal
hops
so
add
that
to
the
metallic
finish
and
the
muted
flavor
this
was
not
a
hit
for
me
it
wasnt
awful
but
wasnt
good

down
but
i
suppose
you
could
drink
worse
im
sure
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
o
nothing

about
this

it
looks
good

thats
about
it

nice

beer
let
it
get
a
bit
warmer
for
it
to
open
up
like
i
mentioned
in
the
taste
profile
it
just
feels
like
a
beer
that
is
missing
a
major
flavor
there
are
decent
hints
here
and
there
but
it
is
somewhere
between
macro
and
decent
pale
ale
does
improve
with
warmth
somewhat
but
there
is
still
some
fruityraisin
flavor
that
is
a
astringent
one
of
newcastles
better
offerings
good
balance
not
over
sweet
i
had
this
with
lunch
and
it
was
great
with
food
worth
a
shot
o
this
is
nothing
special
i
was
hoping
for
a
really
great
spring
brew
but
am
slightly
disappointed
id
only
have
this
on
tap
depending
upon
what
else
was
served
overall
a
good
offering
from
newcastle
the
flavors
are
somewhat
tame
but
theres
a
nice
allaround
balance
certainly
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
option
for
session
drinking
an
okay
ale
seems
mass
produced
and
lacking
passion
gives
some
slight
promising
character
but
doesnt
deliver
a
real
firm
punch
could
have
been
a
whole
lot
more
but
its
clear
these
guys
are
catering
to
the
mass
market
decent
but
not
anything
spectacular
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
the
taste
but
this
beer
goes
down
like
a
breeze
and
is
quite
quaffable
o
an
easy
drinking
english
pale
ale
nothing
incredibly
crazy
herejust
a
drinkable
simple
brew
but
i
like
it
nonetheless
o
an
easytodrink
pale
ale
that
is
a
great
value
8
or
9
for
a
sixer
a
great
way
to
introduce
your
friends
to
the
joys
of
pale
ales
it
has
the
sharp
edge
you
expect
but
not
as
hard
as
the
ranger
or
sam
adams

not
a
bad
brew
but
kind
of
ho
hum
overall
i
could
care
less
whether
i
drank
it
again
or
not
this
beer
borders
on
the
european
lager
taste
profile
even
though
it
is
an
ale
it
does
have
a
slight
hop
presence
not
much
going
on
in
the
ways
of
the
malt
overall
not
as
good
as
newcastle
which
in
my
opinion
is
already
pretty
mediocreaverage
i
can
definitely
drink
a
pack
of
these
without
complaining
and
if
someone
had
a
keg
of
it
somewhere
i
would
be
pretty
psyched
compared
to
a
keg
of
bud
light
but
all
in
all
there
are
definite
better
brews
to
spend
your
8
99orso
on
c
rated
average
notes
well
its
not
too
bad
and
its
drinkable
very
good
for
a
warm
day
cheers
this
was
an
average
beer
from
what
i
understand
some
of
the
newcastle
offerings
are
actually
brewed
by
one
of
the
heineken
breweries
i
believe
some
of
the
seasonals
may
still
brewed
by
caledonian
overall
i
would
probably
consider
keeping
this
one
on
hand
as
a
sessionable
ale
when
having
macrolovers
over
to
the
house
o
a
solid
quaffer
nothing
more
worth
a
single
pickup
for
fans
of
this
style
two
12oz
bottles
dumped
into
an
imperial
pint
clear
copper
thin
head
of
white
forms
over
the
mild
carbonation
barley
husk
bread
crust
some
minty
hop
flavor
at
the
end
a
touch
of
fruit
on
the
nose
rounds
it
out
decent
for
a
midday
quaff
but
its
not
impressive
enough
to
go
back
to
the
store
for
a
six
pack
a
very
big
fan
of
newcastle
was
happy
to
see
this
in
the
store
recently
and
picked
up
a
6
pack
with
the
winter
ipa
and
werewolf
looks
like
newcastle
is
branching
out
this
is
hardly
an
impressive
looking
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
very
slight
bubbly
head
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
the
smell
is
pretty
underwhelming
as
well
sweet
slightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
raisinprune
but
very
plain
therefore
before
i
took
my
first
sip
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
however
this
might
be
one
of
the
smoothest
easiest
to
drink
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
but
is
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
its
malty
slightly
grainy
doesnt
pack
the
best
punch
but
it
is
solid
and
just
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
like
thumbs
up
o
not
that
impressed
a
good
springtime
beer
would
definitely
stick
with
the
brown
ale
newcastle
needs
to
found
a
better
taste
overall
id
imagine
this
is
better
on
draft
and
on
a
warm
day
wouldnt
turn
this
down
in
the
future
not
a
bad
beer
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
translucent
amber
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
lacing
looks
great
the
nose
is
extremely
sweet
overly
so
with
a
strong
caramel
tone
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
sweetness
is
too
much
and
districts
the
flavor
starts
with
a
nice
light
bready
malt
flavor
from
which
the
caramel
builds
again
the
sweetness
appears
and
begins
to
overwhelm
the
flavor
mildly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
but
the
sweetness
is
too
much
lighter
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
lingering
sugar
flavor
overall
too
sweet
for
me
not
balanced
at
all
glad
to
have
tried
this
as
i
had
not
heard
of
it
but
i
wont
be
back
decent
head
and
lacing
bronze
color
beer
lots
of
carbonation
a
sweet
malty
corn
smell
taste
is
smooth
sweet
uncomplicated
a
little
bready
flavor
on
the
back
end
and
a
touch
of
sourness
like
the
kind
youd
find
with
jack
daniels
again
reminding
me
of
corn
could
probably
have
several
because
it
goes
down
easily
but
there
are
better
session
beers
out
there
taste
is
mild
with
malts
in
the
classic
english
pale
ale
tradition
but
more
balanced
than
others
ive
had
of
late
i
get
a
gentle
hint
of
citrus
hops
in
the
mix
which
makes
for
a
solid
and
enjoyable
brew
solid
enough
of
a
sessioner
not
bad
more
drinkable
than
their
flagship
which
speaks
volumes
i
cant
get
too
firedup
on
this
pale
ale
drinkable
but
not
memorable
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
would
this
be
one
of
the
first
beers
id
go
for
if
given
a
choice
nope
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
not
much
head
but
the
latter
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
pour
malty
aroma
has
a
fruity
undertone
and
is
not
strong
but
still
invites
a
taste
flavor
whoa
now
that
is
good
flavor
malty
core
apple
plus
more
than
a
hint
of
pear
hint
of
horehound
smooth
and
somewhat
fizzy
texture
has
more
than
average
body
if
this
is
not
outstanding
it
is
still
worthy
of
a
try
overall

this
is
a
pretty
standardtasting
english
pale
in
my
mind
not
bad
not
spectacular
and
more
or
less
what
you
could
expect
if
you
blindly
chose
a
pale
in
a
random
english
pub
its
decent
it
looks
fantastic
though
beyond
that
its
pretty
typical
for
an
english
pale
itd
probably
be
a
decent
caskconditioning
candidate
and
could
easily
see
this
on
gravity
at
a
better
english
pub
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
very
intriguing
im
not
trying
to
knock
this

there
are

cheers
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
mellow
gingerbread
maltiness
in
the
taste
not
much
but
a
standard
gingerbread
like
maltiness
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
gingerbread
like
maltiness
kind
of
a
standard
english
ale
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
i
cant
really
say
too
much
about
this
english
pale
ale
but
go
and
get
some
just
clean
tasty
pale
ale
with
a
wonderful
balance
ya
know
sometimes
i
get
bored
of
over
the
top
beers
if
you
just
want
a
great
ale
to
sip
on
or
even
pound
down
this
is
it
the
drinkability
is
perfect
pours
a
clear
copper
with
an
off
white
creamy
head
that
fades
quickly
a
distinctly
dried
apricot
bouquet
that
acts
as
a
spoiler
for
what
will
ultimately
stimulate
the
palate
lovely
tangerine
and
dried
apricot
that
drops
abruptly
to
expose
a
mild
tartness
at
the
beers
finish
extremely
drinkable
beer
this
is
what
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
british
style
pale
ale
considering
its
price
if
i
wanted
a
real
easy
drinker
on
the
cheap
i
would
pick
this
up
again
overall
for
the
style
yeah
this
is
different
good
for
them
for
trying
something
new
but
i
am
not
drawn
to
this
at
all
the
body
is
light
as
expected
though
the
crispness
comes
from
a
carbonation
that
fades
off
toward
the
middle
its
pretty
dry
until
that
point
at
which
it
becomes
even
drier
and
pushes
out
an
astringent
element
though
its
not
extreme
a
very
sessionable
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
but
its
an
english
pale
ale
an
ok
pale
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
maltgrain
butter
and
some
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
of
maltgrain
and
some
off
buttery
and
vegetal
flavors
there
is
a
weird
herbal
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
just
not
a
very
good
beer
all
around
some
of
the
other
newcastle
seasonal
beers
have
been
tolerable
but
this
one
is
definitely
at
the
bottom
of
the
pack
will
make
for
an
upscale
round
of
beer
pong
an
average
middle
of
the
road
unoffensive
example
of
the
style
rather
weak
but
at
least
it
isnt
overly
suffused
with
corn
sugar
and
other
adjuncts
in
the
flavor
profile
o
not
the
most
enjoyable
beer
im
no
expert
on
the
style
and
ive
never
consumed
an
english
beer
from
the
source
where
im
sure
they
are
a
lot
better
but
lets
just
say
im
glad
i
got
a
single
bottle
instead
of
the
six
or
twelve
pack
overall
not
really
worth
it
much
better
pale
ales
out
there
and
newcastles
one
and
only
brown
is
one
of
my
favorites
if
i
had
to
rank
them
some
companies
excel
in
their
main
brew
some
extend
that
to
their
expansions
this
would
be
an
example
of
one
that
just
pure
and
simple
failed
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
beer
that
fails
to
distinguish
itself
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
beer
either
to
be
honest
if
i
had
not
reviewed
it
i
would
have
forgotten
that
i
even
tried
pours
to
a
generous
but
coarse
head
with
lots
of
large
fish
eye
bubbles
and
generous
sticky
lace
with
a
golden
amberbrown
color
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
pastries
with
a
floral
and
fruity
aroma
possibly
attributed
to
esters
and
hops
flavor
is
a
complex
blend
of
sweet
malt
biscuits
in
the
british
sense
and
spicy
hop
flavor
and
resiny
hop
bittnerness
to
balance
it
out
this
tastes
fresher
than
what
usually
comes
across
the
pond
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
co2
is
refreshingly
restrained
this
would
be
an
entirely
different
experience
on
the
palate
if
it
had
been
pumped
up
to
an
american
co2
level
overall
this
is
tasty
complex
and
well
composed
epa
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
beer
very
good
tastes
going
on
but
a
very
nice
balance
i
could
and
have
drank
these
beers
all
day
long
great
beer
for
the
spring
time
i
nice
new
offering
from
newcastle
medium
amber
and
clear
with
a
thin
fine
head
on
top
the
aroma
has
husky
grains
and
fruit
with
a
hint
of
toffee
a
taste
reveals
a
full
fruity
english
yeast
profile
with
a
smooth
caramel
backbone
throughout
is
a
mild
bitterness
that
surrounds
it
all
this
is
a
medium
bodied
clean
and
crisp
english
pale
ale
very
well
done
and
drinkable
though
not
bold
really
its
an
easydrinking
and
tasty
beer
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
at
cellar
temperature
a
fairly
small
white
head
forms
on
the
pour
maintaining
a
foamy
cap
all
the
way
down
carbonation
appears
light
as
is
appropriate
for
the
style
and
unfortunately
increasingly
uncommon
in
bottled
pale
ales
the
beer
is
a
very
clear
dark
orange
the
nose
is
of
hay
light
toffee
and
pear
skin
the
flavor
reveals
a
nutty
toffeecaramel
balanced
by
a
light
bitterness
with
some
english
hop
character
the
finish
is
a
tad
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
really
a
very
decent
english
pale
ale
nicely
balanced
tending
toward
the
malty
side
overall
a
very
passable
beer
by
the
people
who
brought
you
newcastle
brown
ale
the
lighter
body
and
sweeter
flavor
may
make
this
a
replacement
for
my
usual
mass
consumption
brew
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
maybe
o
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
i
enjoyed
this
new
newcastle
rjt
pretty
average
brew
when
it
comes
to
pale
ales
its
appearance
was
the
color
i
expected
but
the
lace
was
not
there
the
smell
was
very
light
i
smelled
more
yeast
smells
than
hops
the
taste
is
fine
it
is
a
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
overall
i
would
not
buy
it
in
a
6
pack
but
that
is
my
opinion
poured
into
a
nonic
a
nice
clear
copper
with
a
thinner
white
head
atoplike
many
uk
pale
ales
it
has
a
nice
richness
and
definition
in
color
muted
aromas
with
mainly
caramelbiscuit
malt
coming
into

it
warms
a

wich
i
donl
like
so
much
eh
its
average
and
to
be
honest
boringtoday
iam
drinking
alot
of
session
style
ales
and
i
would
pick
many
of
them
over
this
overall
this
beer
seems
like
it
is
halfway
to
being
pretty
good
the
initial
flavors
just
drop
off
too
rapidly
and
everything
becomes
muddled
after
that
a
nice
try
though
this
is
a
rather
lackluster
ale
the
flavor
profile
is
so
mild
as
to
be
almost
nonexistent
in
my
opinion
its
rather
boring
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
3112wl3575901
sampled
on
february
7
2012
it
pours
a
medium
amber
tone
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
decent
foamy
lingering
head
that
leaves
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
not
very
astonishing
it
smells
like
an
english
pale
ale
with
its
subtle
sweet
malts
and
a
cool
clean
hop
note
the
body
is
about
medium
but
it
also
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
the
taste
is
about
as
subtle
with
malts
bread
notes
and
an
above
average
hop
bite
with
a
crisp
ending
overall
well
crafted
just
enough
to
be
a
regular
back
to
back
at
the
bar
unfortunately
this
is
a
limited
release
and
get
it
while
you
can
salud
overall
id
have
to
pass
and
i
guess
thats
been
the
consensus
there
are
just
too
many
better
english
ales
out
there
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
a
good
pale
ale
i
doubt
the
brits
were
thinking
of
competing
with
sierra
nevada
for
an
inexpensive
but
damn
good
pale
ale
but
if
they
had
they
failed
overall
a
nice
pale
ale
that
is
easy
to
drink
provides
pleanty
of
flavor
and
well
balanced
another
good
beer
from
the
uk
overall
while
not
a
beer
to
be
celebrated
it
is
okay
it
is
drinkable
and
a
far
sight
better
than
some
of
their
other
seasonal
offerings
this
is
by
no
means
a
stellar
beer
but
it
is
a
timid
approach
to
how
i
imagine
early
english
mild
ales
might
have
tasted
certainly
not
offensive
but
a
very
light
ale
all
arround
eh
didnt
think
id
say
it
but
the
original
newcastle
probably
has
a
better
flavor
profile
im
a
rookie
to
their
seasonal
lineup
except
fro
the
summer
which
wasnt
too
bad
this
was
a
super
fresh
english
pale
less
than
5
abv
sure
no
problem
pours
a
copper
amber
hue
with
a
bright
slightly
off
whtie
head
forms
thick
and
dwindles
slow
leaves
behind
speckled
lacing
aroma
earthy
citrus
hops
intertwined
with
fruit
malts
and
hints
of
caramel
a
really
good
finesse
beer
its
not
in
your
face
but
each
sniff
and
sip
draws
you
in
further
basically
compare
full
blown
hardcore
porn
american
pale
ale
to
a
burlesque
show
where
you
may
get
a
peek
at
some
leg
with
a

thus
far
a

a

of
toasted

something
i
really
dont
get
from
newcastle
at
all
the
body
is
a
light
medium
and
again
wondering
about
its
age
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz

has
a

with
a
12

taste
is

some
sweetness
a
bit
of
fruit
light
hops
are
present
feels
light
in

and
overall
is
a
smooth
and
refreshing
beer
i
liked
this
beer
not
a
bad
offering
new
castle
rivals
there
brown
ale
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
and
got
exactly
that
overall
i
gave
this
an
average
rating
it
did
nothing
for
me
i
would
drink
this
again
if
handed
one
overall
3
42
glad
i
didnt
purchase
a
six
pack
of
this
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
at
2
a
shot
well
whatever
their
flagship
beer
is
better
on
to
the
next
one
getting
crunked
tonight
a
nice
golden
colored
ale
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
grass
notes
and
grains
taste
is
sweet
toasted
grains
grass
with
a
bitter
ending
palate
is
medium
body
crisp
with
good
carbonation
finishes
with
a
toasted

flavor
grass
notes
fruity
with
a
moderate
hops
bitterness
bite
and
a
bit
of
a
nutty
aftertaste
as
well
overall
nothing
really
stand
out
but
still
an
ok
summer
brew
overall
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
another
one
i
highly
recommend
its
a
good
beer
overall
not
good
at
all
worth
a
try
flavor
pleasant
combination
with
the
sweet
white
bread
malts
along
with
a
tangy
earthy
hops
overall
since
this
is
a
summer
beer
i
actually
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
hop
characteristics
by
no
means
is
this
a
hopbomb
but
it
has
a
nice
bitterness
that
sets
it
apart
from
so
many
of
the
super
sweet
summer
ales
that
are
so
popular
at
present
a
perfectly
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
nothing
really
wow
or
amazing
or
different
for
that
matter
mainly
bought
it
because
of
the
name
and
label
on
it
i
definitely
prefer
the
darker
newcastle
brews
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
little
citrus
flair
in
there
personally
notes
overall
this
one
just
didnt
impress
me
o
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
with
this
beer
if
one
could
return
alcohol
i
would
have
however
this
is
a
summer
beer
and
i
am
trying
it
in
october
i
was
unable
to
find
a
date
on
it
but
if
i
assume
it
was
bottled
in
april
may
or
june
then
that
would
put
the
age
at
around
6
months
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
style
is
also
not
my
first
choice
alas
i
may
pick
this
up
again
next
late
springearly
summer
and
give
it
another
shot
after
all
everyone
deserves
a
second
chance
a
decent
pale
that
drinks
easily
a
little
thin
and
watery
feel
overall
but
then
its
pretty
light
in
the
abv
department
too
so
this
is
a
really
good
candidate
for
a
session
ale
what
it
lacks
in
body
in
does
a
fair
enough
job

chalice

and
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
the
color
and
the
aroma
was
ok
i
really
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
and
the
amount
of
bitterness
this
beer
had
but
i
did
not
care
for
the
flavor
at
all
there
seemed
to
be
some
notes
of
toasted

as
well
light

with
a

the
taste
is
close
to
the

with
a

and
a
slight

bitter

overall
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
i
do
like
their
regular
brown
ale
and
their

ale
was
better
than
this
overall
it
was

overall
bad

aroma
good

and
better
body
than
aroma
but
still
very
poor
from
a
brown
bottle
in
to
a
newcastle
geordie
schooner
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
thins
out
in
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
light
fruit
white
grape
and
pear
come
to
mind
with
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
background
toffee
flavor
starts
things
out
with
the
fruit
flavors
passing
by
finishing
with
a
quick
tart
bitterness
before
being
sticky
sweet
on
the
lips
the
beer
is
crisp
light
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
mildly
malty
with
some
light
toasted
grain
in
the
taste
with
some
light
hop
notes
adding
to
the
flavor
with
subtle
sweet
elements
from
the
malt
and
mild
yeast
fruitiness
but
in
general
it
has
a
somewhat
gentle
flavor
profile
befitting
the
style
i
like
this
and
would
enjoy
it
again
but
it
would
not
be
the
first
choice
unless
i
was
having
for
a
lawnmower
ale
it
is
pretty
well
suited
for
a
quenching
thirst
slaking
ale
of
that
type
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
ive
had
some
of
the
other
newcastle
offerings
and
havent
really
cared
for
them
i
found
this
ale
to
be
different
from
the
standard
brit
ale
and
american
ale
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
pleasant
and
refreshing
and
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
not
a
bad
effort
from
newcastle
on
a
light
and
summery
brew
a
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
i
would
consider
picking
up
some
more
of
this
o
i
think
this
is
an
ok
thirst
quencher
but
it
has
some
flaws
that
will
keep
me
from
buying
it
again
overall
the
lightly
bitter
grass
lemon
and
earth
flavors
at
the
end
of
the
taste
was
actually
rather
nice
for
the
brew
and
made
for
a
nice
drinking
summer
beer
with
a
bit
more
earthiness
then
most
o
sorry
i
prefer
brunettes
and
redheads
while
not
very
distinctive
it
is
refreshing
and
quaffable
for
another
humid
summer
day
in
the
nineties
i
am
pleased
to
see
newcastle
expanding
their
product
line
verdict
extremely
poundable
summer
beer
if
your
looking
for
a
lighter
slightly
hoppier
summer
ale
not
bad
at
all
d
light
refreshing
while
providing
a
decent
amount
of
malt
complexity
wouldnt
have
minded
a
greater
hop
presence
but
im
not
exactly
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
overall
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
not
memorable
in
any
way
grassy
musty
horse
blanket
taste
very
little
malt
taste
a
little
breadiness
but
really
i
expected
more
from
a
caledonian
beer
somewhat
thin
could
had
a
little
more
to
the
mouthfeel
but
overall
quite
disappointing
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
grassy
or
hay
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
earthy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
fairly
flavorful
but
has
a
slightly
better
smell
in
my
opinion
o
not
as
good
as
i
remember
from
a
year
ago
but
an
ok
summer
refresher
with
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
o
worth
trying
since
im
a
blonde
ale
fan
but
this
doesnt
match
up
to
newcastle
brown
or
its
blonde
ale
brethren
pours
a
bright
gold
perfectly
clear
white
head
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
aroma
of
noble
hops
and

in
the
flavor
hoppy
some
mineral
bready
malts
honey
lemon
tea
comes
to
mind
faint
mint
notes
refreshing
light
bodied
with
a
low
carbonation
level
this
drinks
like
water
a
good
session
ale
that
hits
the
spot
in
the
summer
to
the
point
while
not
a
lot
of
fun
to
review
not
reviewogenic
it
is
easy
and
refreshing
tasty
for
a
toasted
lager
or
pale
blonde
i
would
buy
this
again
when
i
want
a
plain
beer
with
a
little
flavor
had
on
tap
at
the
corner
slice
in
greensboro
last
night
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
looking
sticky
one
finger
bone
white
head
atop
toasted
malts
mainly
in
the
nosea
hint
of
sweetness
but
not
much
crisp
feel
and
toasted
crisp
flavors
with
a
bit
of
iron
as
well
on
the
palate
its
light
and
i
didnt
expect
much
but
it
went
down
real
easy
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
sessionable
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
overall
not
going
to
get
this
one
again
but
it
was
easy
enough
to
knock
back
even
from
the
bottle
rjt
pours
out
to
a
thin
white
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
bits
of
foam
on
the
side
of
the
glass
color
is
a
deep
gold
a
brassy
blond
aroma
is
sweet
buttery
and
slightly
hoppy
and
estery
flavor
is
a
balanced
mix
of
sweet
grains
cascade
hop
flavors
and
a
pleasant
bracing
finish
mouthfeel
is
correct
for
style
nothing
special
there
this
is
a
good
beer
a
solid
choice
it
gets
tastier
and
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
o
this
beer
tasted
better
after
i
had
left
it
in
the
glass
for
about
half
an
hour
the
baby
needed
to
be
bathed
and
put
to
bed
so
i
had
to
take
a
break
i
would
definitely
allow
this
one
to
sit
before
drinking
more
of
it
but
on
the
other
hand
i
wouldnt
really
seek
it
out
not
bad
but
didnt
have
any
memorable
positive
aspects
for
me
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
with
a
reasonable
supply
of
grainy
pale
malts
and
clean
hop
ending
it
is
lot
like
a
pilsener
in
that
regard
newcastle
should
be
commended
for
trying
new
things
but
they
would
be
better
off
sticking
with
what
they
do
best
their
classic
brown
ale
overall
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
citrus
comes
out
its
a
fairly
easy
drinker
atmosphere
is
okay
nice
hue
solid
head
not
much
lacing
nose
is
really
pungent
and
almost
rancid
hop
tone
with
some
sweet
tea
leaf
and
dish
soap
the
pungency
really
overwhelms
the
flavor
profile
soapy
and
leafy
overall
this
is
not
so
good
a
quaff
as
i
mentioned
earlier
inoffensive
but
rather
bland
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
hot
day
its
a
pedestrian
light
pale
ale
i
see
from
the
label
that
they
uss
e
kinds
of
hops
cascade
hallertau
and
northdown
ive
never
heard
of
that
last
one
not
many
really
good
blonde
ales
out
there
but
this
one
is
very
respectable
but
this
is
in
fact
an
english
pale
not
as
promising
styleconsidering
apologies
for
the
lack
of
style
this
is
my
first
review
hope
to
get
better
overall
a
good
summer
beer
and
and
decently
refreshing
it
is
in
no
way
best
of
its
kind
but
it
isnt
with
out
its
charm
i
can
see
consuming
this
to
beat
the
heat
of
summer
while
not
getting
drunk
single

head
with
some

a
recently
released
seasonal
and
what
they
say
us
limited
beer
standard
newcastle
brew
not
terrible
and
decently
drinkable
watery
tasteless
very
foamy
after
opening
the
can
only
redeeming
factor
is
that
its
easy
to
drink
since
it
tastes
like
nothing
love
it
very
creamy
smooth
all
the
way
through
had
this
for
the
first
time
recently
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
not
the
best
beer
i
have
had
but
was
easy
to
drink
bland
soft
tasteless
dark
mediocre
i
like
this
for
being
out
with
my
buddies
and
drinking
session
that
leaves
me
good
the
next
morning
the
nitro
offers
lots
of
creaminess
and
a
nice
flow
in
the
light
body
with
its
gentle
crispness
what
i
notice
in
this
beer
though
is
that
it
falls
off
at
the
end
of
every
sip
and
thins
out
still
it
doesnt
fall
too
far
and
keeps
up
a
pretty
good
smoothness
very
happy
i
recently
ran
into
this
really
did
not
enjoy
this
one
maybe
i
got
an
old
can
but
it
was
pretty
bad
all
in
all
tetleys
is
good
stuff
recommended
overall
quite
a
good
beer
and
one
that
you
wouldnt
worry
too
much
if
you
threw
a
couple
back
with
remarkable
complexity
in
the
feel
of
it
light
yet
perceptible
complex
but
not
bewildering
cheers
overall
a
nice
mild
fairly
wellbalanced
ale
id
prefer
more
maltiness
and
body
probably
wont
buy
this
again
as
im
sure
there
are
others
out
there
worth
trying
that
are
easy
to
obtain
pours
a
clear
dark
orange

down
smell
is
of

fruits
and
a

taste
is
much
the

and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
but
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
looks
great
in
the
glass
but
is
quite
mild
aroma
and
flavor
wise
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
i
sit
down
for
a
review
i
find
it
quite
flavorful
id
make
it
my
session
beer
if
it
werent
still
near
10
for
the
four
tall
cans
why
cant
somebody
make
a
sub4
beer
at
a
discounted
price
poured

into

appearance
with
a
foamy

that
remains

watery
but
holds
onto
a
distinctly
creamy
taste
hints
of
lemon
citrus
malt
and
a
slight
grassiness
upfront
with
a
clean
finish
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
but
very
smooth
and
the
creaminess
of
the
ale
keeps
it
interesting
poured
into
standard

first
impression
i
like
the
color
copper
with
slight
orange
hue
not
much
aroma
hint
of
bread
after
carbonation
settled
14
head
nice
lacing
as
the
glass
emptied
good
flavor
the
smallest
bit
of
bitterness
very
low
alcohol
content
not
an
issue
for
me
as
i
dont
drink
for
the
purpose
of
getting
drunk
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
foods
although
i
prefer
stronger
tasting
beers
with
spicey
foods
overall
i
am
quite
happy
with
tettleys
i
would
buy
again
this
beer
has
a
nice
coppery
colour
and
a
creamy
look
and
texture
surprisingly
so
for
such
a
light
beer
it
has
some
hints
of
bready
malts
and
also
tea
leaves
if
im
not
mistaken
just
a
slight
bitterness
is
present
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
this
definitely
falls
into
the
session
beer
category
at
3
7
abv
probably
the
lowest
alcohol
beer
ive
had
discounting
the
dietlowcarb
beers
definitely
gets
a
thumbsup
from
me
random
can
from
my
fridge
poured
into
an
uk
imperial
pint
glass
nice
rush
of
carbonation
forms
a
thick
but
thin
white
head
sunset
orange
colored
body
smell
was
faintly
of
marmalade
taste
was
mild
with
a
smooth
malt
flavor
and
just
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
creamy
which
is
one
reason
i
always
enjoy
nitro
beers
real
low
abv
could
lead
to
numerous
cans
being
consumed
a
light
but
satisfyingly
rich
beer
to
drink
o
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
due
to
its
light
body
and
low
alcohol
content
if
i
was
choosing
a
session
beer
this
wouldnt
be
first
on
the
list
but
not
last
either
o
very
refreshing
very
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
extremely
sessionable
and
definitely
one
that
i
could
have
many
of
in
a
single
session
i
really
enjoy
the
creaminess
and
it
is
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
nitrotap
when
i
was
in
the
uk
a
lot
of
flavor
considering
its
3
6
but
compared
to
most
beer
its
just
average
nitro
pour
is
always
cool
looking
creamy
cream
colored
head
clear
amber
body
smells
faintly
of
english
yeast
not
the
most
aromatic
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
nothing
offensive
or
off
balanced
caramel
cereal
malt
flavors
hardly
any
bitterness
fun
to
drink
highlight
is
the
mouthfeel
could
be
that
im
drinking
a
3
6
english
beer
in
america
but
really
no
hop
presence
im
here
in
the
usa
i
had
this
beer
once
many
years
ago
when
i
was
in
england
with
the
us
marines
a
few
years
ago
while
living
in
south
florida
i
was
able
to
buy
this
again
however
i
moved
to
pennsylvania
and
i
can
not
find
it
anywhere
i
was
searching
and
found
this
site
tonight
can
someone
please
send
me
some
info
on
where
i
can
order
this
and
have
it
shipped
to
me
thank
you
very
much
if
you
can
jim
at
o
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
brew
i
will
have
to
look
for
this
stylecontainer
more
often
overall
good
to
have
only
one
will
never
have
again
i
hate
to
bash
a
beer
but
looks
can
be
recovering
can
be
compared
to
other
like
beers
but
doesnt
step
to
that
level
salud
o
i
admittedly
enjoy
these
nitro
can
english
ales
more
than
most
this
one
is
pretty
good
hell
at
3
6
abv
i
might
plan
to
put
back
a
bunch
of
these
while
i
watch
the
euro
2012
football
championship
if
you
like
boddingtons
and
speckled
hen
out
of
the
nitro
can
youll
likely
enjoy
this
as
well
3
0
d
straightforward
average
beer
itd
probably
be
tastier
without
the
nitro
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
the
style
definitely
could
session
a
few
of
these
great
tasting
nice
looking
real
filling
and
light
bodied
super
sessionable
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
english
beer
but
not
the
best
that
is
out
there
pretty
run
of
the
mill
would
like
to
have
it
on
tap
sometime
overall
interesting
in
general
but
might
be
appreciated
more
from
a
tap
simple
absolutely
quaffable
so
soft
and
creamy
only
knocks
might
be
a
very
faint
metallic
aroma
and
aftertaste
and
a
slight
overall
wateriness
still
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
dont
be
an
antinitro
bigot
this
appears
a
ruddy
brown
with
a
lot
of
foam
one
of
those
widget
cans
is
there
any
aroma
im
not
picking
up
on
it
doesnt
bode
well
for
the
flavor
eithertastes
very
thin
watery
like
its
mocking
better
british
beers
theres
a
somewhat
unwelcome
tartness
that
i
didnt
expect
nor
desire
not
a
lot
else
going
on
here
and
not
any
reason
to
try
it
again
the
appearance
good
very
nice
foamy
headrobust
nutty
colorwith
an
aroma
that
compliments
nice
maltybreadyodorwith
some
sweetness
too
but
all
this
down
the
hatch
well
not
as
rewarding
tasted
almost
like
dirty
water
suprisingly
i
tasted
water
over
everything
will
give
it
another
try
maybe
this
winter
theres
something
that
really
does
it
for
me
with
this
beer
i
like
the
nuance
of
the
aroma
and
bitterness
along
with
very
high
drinkability
might
be
a
bit
dull
for
some
but
one
of
my
favorites
o
tetleys
is
a
true
disappointment
i
have
to
wonder
if
its
appeal
is
due
to
a
degree
of
sentimentality
or
whether
it
all
boils
down
to
availability
in
any
regard
i
will
not
likely
be
drinking
a
can
of
this
stuff
again
o
if
it
had
more
flavor
i
would
love
it
but
they
just
didnt
pack
quite
enough
in
there
delightful
enjoy
yourself
from
a
widget
can
a
large
crack
and
hiss
then
in
one
fluid
motion
i
pour
into
an
awaiting
glass
foam
filled
glass
slowly
turns
brilliant
copper
with
a
good
two
finger
white
head
that
has
great
retention
and
lace
faint
lack
luster
aroma
is
malty
earthy
with
a
bit
of
wet
dog
taste
is
subtle
with
light
fruit
and
dark
sugars
malty
and
earthy
taste
medium
to
thin
body
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
creamy
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
especially
complex
or
overly
flavorful
at
3
6
abv
i
could
probably
pound
these
all
night
but
the
real
question
is
would
i
want
to
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
verything
white
head
on
top
that
vanishes
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
lager
like
aromas
mixedwith
some
sweet
malts
and
grains
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
light
but
had
some
bread
like
flavors
and
a
dry
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
some
light
carobation
and
has
an
easy
going
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
in
my
opinion
not
too
much
else
to
say
really
o
nothing
fancy
easy
drinker
another
decent
session
beer
this
is
a
good
everyday
session
brew
if
thats
what
your
looking
for
beats
hell
out
of
lite
lager
overall
a
o
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
brit
who
just
happened
to
be
perusing
the
beer
aisle
when
i
was
i
took
his
interest
in
samuel
smiths
as
a
sign
of
good
taste
in
the
end
its
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
outstanding
youd
have
to
drink
the
whole
four
pack
to
get
buzzed
off
this
stuff
and
thats
a
bit
upsetting
oh
well
itll
be
good
for
those
who
are
just
getting
into
beer
o
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
given
the
appearance
and
smell
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
commonly
look
for
not
sure
why
i
had
to
have
this
one
at
armanettis
i
just
did
good
for
me
right
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
stoic
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
light
lemon
zest
lightish
biscuit
and
balsa
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
very
light
orange
peel
white
bread
and
a
moderate
touch
of
dark
greens
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
decidedly
smooth
feel
overall
an
enjoyable
easytodrink
brew
not
bad
at
all
overall
i
truly
believe
this
to
be
a
great
beer
in
a
can
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
on
draft
i
paid
8
99
for
4
pint
cans
and
i
believe
it
was
more
than
worth
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
an
ol
english
chap
teacolored
ale
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
retains
for
a
long
time
very
subtle
aroma
lightly
sweet
toasted
bready
flavors
of
bread
and
honey
some
mild
smoky
biscuit
and
fruits
as
well
not
a
very
creamy
ale
despite
having
a
head
that
resembles
vanilla
milkshake
overall
drinkability
well
for
something
that
may
be
over
a
year
old
its
held
up
pretty
well
although
i
wonder
what
im
missing
due
to
its
age
very
sessionable
beer
and
as
much
as
some
of
the
parts
are
not
really
amazing
i
actually
could
have
another
one
i
think
id
have
to
have
it
with
a
meal
though
for
more
than
one
by
itself
its
just
okay
but
again
i
do
wonder
how
much
age
is
affecting
the
flavor
and
aroma
here
o
this
is
a
fine
lowmedium
alcohol
nitro
ale
low
hop
presence
overall
and
that
might
be
its
weakest
point
besides
being
a
bit
low
on
the
gravity
side
tasty
ale
overall
just
an
average
pub
ale
o
pretty
average
nice
to
try
not
up
to
par
for
regular
use
pours
a
2
head
of
tiny
velvet
bubbles
which
dissipates
to
14
head
looks
like
clear
lipton
tea
smells
and
tastes
like
corn
water
like
most
any
other
mass
produced
new
world
watered
down
beer
the
only
saving
grace
to
this
thing
is
the
froth
caused
by
the
widget
in
the
can
pick
most
any
other
generic
beer
can
it
with
a
widget
and
youd
have
tetleys
plus
the
froth
wasnt
even
as
long
lasting
or
effective
as
other
products
with
that
same
feature
like
boddingtons
slainte
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
i
could
see
drinking
several
of
these
no
problem
the
taste
was
initially
metallic
but
after
the
next
few
sips
that
subsided
into
a
very
basic
and
very
good
light
malt
and
light
hop
profile
definitely
recommend
this
for
some
long
term
sessioning
solid
brew
nothing
special
in
the
taste
but
definitely
a
super
drinkable
session
beer
overall
great
beer
totally
drinkable
but
still
plenty
of
complexity
in
this
guy
i
always
find
myself
wishing
that
this
were
the
style
of
beer
that
one
could
find
on
tap
in
every
american
bar
instead
of
bud
light
at
3
6
abv
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
that
i
could
just
drink
all
night
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
at
3
6
percent
you
could
drink
these
all
day
and
has
a
flavor
that
was
enjoyable
enough
to
me
to
want
to
have
quite
a
few
this
beer
will
probably
be
one
i
would
enjoy
to
visit
from
time
to
time
m
creamy
smooth
slightly
dry
an
easy
drinker
at
this
low
abv
you
could
drink
these
seemingly
all
day
its
tasty
and
just
something
you
dont
have
to
think
much
about
when
drinking
the
best
example
of
an
english
ale
i
have
encountered
every
now
and
then
i
get
on
a
kick
for
a
certain
type
country
of
origin
etc
type
of
beer
since
i
had
dinner
last
night
at
an
english
pubresteraunt
and
had
a
few
old
speckled
hens
i
wanted
to
try
some
more
british
brews
i
got
a
four
pack
of
this
one
at
the
local
bevmo
today
golden
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
nitro
head
smooth
and
creamy
with
gentle
fruitiness
and
some
faint
roasty
malts
i
like
it
but
like
others
have
reviewed
there
just
isnt
much
there
its
very
subdued
to
say
the
least
yet
enjoyably
drinkable
drinkability
is
fine
aside
from
the
old
tool
shed
thing
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
i
may
make
a
point
to
keep
this
on
hand
in
the
fridge
drinkability
looks
great
feels
great
just
wished
it
tasted
great
doesnt
taste
bad
it
just
lacks
any
real
flavor
at
all
d
i
love
the
look
and
feel
of
nitrobeers
in
general
although
i
dont
really
like
what
it
does
for
the
flavor
this
beer
is
no
exception
the
nitrogen
flattens
out
what
is
already
a
very
basic
flavor
profile
to
me
as
unthinkingly
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
it
doesnt
quite
offer
enough
to
peak
the
interest
for
multiple
takes
is
this
manufactured
by
the
tea
company
its
darn
good
anyway
pours
spectacularly
with
the
widget
super
creamy
with
a
pretty
bright
white
head
much
less
metallic
taste
than
any
other
nitrocan
ive
ever
had
amazing
how
complex
such
a
seemingly
simplelooking
beer
can
be
very
good
sure
looks
pretty
though
drinkability
definitely
a
session
beer
does
great
as
a
refreshing
postexertion
beer
might
go
well
with
a
garnish
of
citrus
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
atmosphere
is
really
solid
the
appearance
is
quite
majestic
really
the
nose
not
so
impressive
but
its
what
the
style
dictates
does
well
for
what
it
is
the
flavor
is
nice
and
full
nothing
all
that
impressive
but
full
great
texture
and
feel
with
this
one
too
id
say
presentation
appearance
and
feel
is
its
strong
suit
with
the
tangibles
nose
and
palette
not
as
outstanding
but
not
bad
either
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
the
aroma
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
creamy
foamy
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
cream
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
the
palate
is
average
for
the
style
but
the
nitro
head
give
it
a
creamy
oily
feel
overall
this
beer
has
high
drink
ability
pours
golden
tan
with
a
really
pretty
1
head
smells
lightly
of
malts
the
flavor
is
also
light
malts
the
first
can
i
had
was
nice
malts
and
thats
about
it
the
second
can
has
just
a
hint
of
metallic
which
is
why
i
only
gave
it
a
3
on
taste
i
love
the
mouthfeel
on
these
nitro
cans
feels
like
cream
very
nice
you
could
probably
put
several
away
at
only
3
8
mediumbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
easily
drinkable
and
an
excellent
candidate
for
a
session
beer
poured
into
a
tall
pint
glass
the
whole
thing
appeared
to
foam
but
slowly
gave
way
to
dark
yellow
there
was
a
nice
three
finger
head
there
wasnt
anything
notable
when
taking
a
whiff
the
first
sip
was
great
this
beer
had
been
in
the
fridge
for
a
bit
bit
it
fortunately
wasnt
all
that
cold
the
thing
i
love
about
these
specific
english
ales
is
the
mouth
feel
its
so
thick
and
creamy
if
anything
its
the
only
why
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
light
enough
that
i
could
go
for
another
one
but
nothing
drastically
grabbed
my
attention
it
has
a
very
light
taste
that
borded
some
cheaper
american
beers
but
the
thickness
of
it
makes
this
beer
better
than
pabts
or
something
this
is
one
of
those
good
beers
you
have
in
the
fridge
when
you
want
something
good
n
light
not
heavy
first
time
having
this
classic
pub
ale
nice
looking
beer
with
an
inch
of
creamy
head
that
stays
till
the
jobs
done
smell
is
of
english
malt
and
bread
from
the
yorkshire
yeast
not
a
big
nose
though
taste
is
not
as
flavorable
as
i
expected
but
still
enjoyable
the
hops
werent
very
pronounced
which
made
for
a
malt
forward
experience
with
very
low
bitterness
super
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
nitrogen
very
mild
beer
that
makes
for
a
great
meal
companion
in
this
case
english
onion
soup
and
fish
and
chips
d
this
beer
drinks
smooth
and
goes
down
well
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
beer
that
id
only
like
to
drink
every
so
often
so
as
not
to
get
tired
of
it
drinkability
a
pretty
good
pub
session
ale
i
bet
this
would
go
very
well
with
deep
fried
bits
the
can
almost
exploded
when
i
opened
it
up
never
had
a
widget
beer
that
did
that
before
pours
slightly
orange
with
about
three
fingers
of
eggshell
colored
head
the
aroma
initially
comes
off
as
somewhat
skunky
but
gets
better
as
i
grow
used
to
the
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
not
due
to
any
appreciable
hop
taste
very
creamy
although
the
nitro
can
produces
plenty
of
perfect
head
the
flat
character
of
the
beer
takes
some
getting
used
to
i
feel
that
the
slightly
skunky
flavor
makes
this
beer
harder
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
being
in
the
mood
and
craving
this
beer
d
this
one
is
an
outrageously
easy
chugger
very
drinkable
id
session
this
with
fish
and
chips
of
course
d
just
as
intended
for
the
style
this
beer
in
infinitely
drinkable
flavorful
but
mild
on
the
palate
not
heavily
carbonated
so
doesnt
bloat
you
very
easily
alcohol
is
low
so
you
can
have
one
after
another
and
still
find
your
way
to
bed
without
any
help
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
the
obvious
knock
is
the
nitro
gimmick
but
some
like
this
so
to
each
his
own
i
dont
know
that
i
would
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
worth
the
try
d
it
was
worth
a
try
on
tap
at
a
british
themed
pub
it
is
a
classic
english
ale
poured
a
hazy
orange
amber
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
very
little
carbonation
if
any
and
very
good
lacing
the
smell
consisted
of
caramel
toffee
biscuit
pear
and
apple
and
the
taste
revealed
a
beautiful
blend
of
all
of
these
individual
flavors
very
smooth
lightbodied
mouthfeel
more
than
likely
the
result
of
the
nitro
excellent
sessionability
d
it
is
a
little
sweet
but
it
does
drink
decently
well
a
good
english
beer
d
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
very
drinkable
would
make
for
a
good
session
brew
but
is
not
overly
palatable
about
on
par
with
a
guinness
poured
from
nitrocan
great
agitation
and
firm
head
fruity
smell
taste
subtle
sweetness
with
smooth
finish
very
drinkable
session
beer
extraordinaire
only
bought
one
but
need
about
four
i
will
buy
some
more
i
see
why
this
is
pub
popular
now
all
i
need
is
a
fireplace
a
beautiful
redheaded
girl
and
some
celtic
music
drinkability
is
good
for
an
pale
on
nitro
this
is
fresh
well
composed
and
just
flavorful
enough
to
warrent
a
second
nicely
crafted
and
drinkable
while
staying
extremely
smooth
overall
a
solid
beer
for
drinking
all
night
i
will
look
for
this
next
time
im
at
an
authentic
english
or
irish
pub
d
this
is
a
beer
you
can
pound
with
its
low
alcohol
and
drink
all
night
but
the
flavour
is
not
really
there
the
pastuerization
and
nitrocanning
probably
took
out
the
qualities
of
what
could
be
a
good
cask
beer
unfortunately
this
is
the
only
way
we
can
try
it
here
in
the
states
d
its
light
in
body
and
alcohol
but
also
on
flavor
however
its
still
a
solid
option
for
a
session
and
was
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
i
followed
up
a
few
cans
of
this
with
a
samuel
smiths
english
ipa
and
it
tasted
like
a
bold
american
ipa
though
d
a
good
example
of
the
style
which
i
would
compare
to
boddingtons
pub
ale
decent
enough
to
want
to
session
with
an
abv
that
would
allow
it
d
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
beer
again
in
the
future
its
too
bad
that
the
pubs
where
i
live
dont
have
this
on
tap
bc
id
be
ordering
this
a
whole
lot
its
very
easy
to
drink
the
low
alcohol
just
provides
a
nice
little
kick
and
its
not
a
heavy
drink
to
be
enjoying
as
a
session
beer
great
stuff
and
hopefully
my
next
one
tastes
a
little
fresher
d
very
light
tasting
beer
the
nitro
and
creamyness
hide
any
particular
full
flavor
notes
pours
out
as
all
foam
and
ends
up
light
brown
with
a
light
creamy
head
as
it
quickly
settles
not
much
of
an
aroma
very
little
taste
too
although
nothing
offensive
either
typical
of
some
of
the
other
english
pale
ales
ive
had
no
body
despite
all
the
foam
no
carbonation
left
either
very
light
you
could
pound
these
if
you
wanted
to
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
barley
notes
taste
is
light
and
very
refreshing
creamy
with
no
bitterness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
very
light
feel
the
nitro
creaminess
makes
this
stupidly
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
not
memorable
either
i
can
see
this
at
3
6
being
the
beer
to
gulp
down
at
your
local
with
the
lads
before
you
head
to
elland
road
to
watch
leeds
kick
some
carlisle
backsides
but
its
pretty
pitiful
in
any
other
context
its
not
even
very
sessionable
because
it
just
isnt
enjoyable
mild
and
inoffensive
but
at
the
expense
of
the
heart
from
the

the
pour
is
a
foamy
nitroexploded
reddishamber
with
about
a
half
a
pint
glass
of
frothy
head
that
simmers
donw
after
several
minutes
the
aroma
is
clean
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
foamy
but
that
is
because
all
you
get
is
the
nitro
foam
for
the
first
3
minutes
once
that
dies
down
the
taste
is
mildly
hopped
sweet
like
caramel
and
pleasant
i
enjoy
these
english
nitro
cans
d
incredibly
drinkable
at
3
6
abv
the
version
i
tried
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
better
session
beer
especially
out
of
other
beer
styles
wow
great
beer
the
other
reviews
are
pretty
good
so
maybe
i
had
a
rotten
can
the
taste
is
likewise
not
overly
powerful
but
is
mellow
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
grainy
yeasty
base
has
a
tiny
late
hop
deposit
that
balances
the
aftertaste
very
well
overall
the
thin
texture
lets
all
the
complexities
come
out
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
style
conclusion
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
to
really
make
me
remember
this
either
if
you
want
something
for
comparison
black
sheep
makes
an
a
yorkshire
pale
ale
at
4
4
that
is
absolutely
outstanding
and
more
complex
than
many
beers
twice
its
strength
d
its
taken
me
a
while
to
get
this
style
what
once
was
a
mundane
pour
of
lowhopped
ale
is
now
a
symphony
of
subtleties
extremely
easy
to
drink
like
water
marry
this
with
a
plate
of
fish
chips
and
youve
got
a
match
made
in
heaven
naysayers
will
find
this
boring
i
find
it
exceptionally
quaffable
and
perfectly
english
a
must
try
d
this
is
truly
a
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
enjoy
the
occasional
nitro
brew
and
this
is
a
good
one
obviously
its
not
a
good
choice
if
youre
looking
for
bold
flavor
but
if
you
want
a
mild
clean
tasting
ale
give
tetleys
a
try
amber
colored
beer
with
a
rich
creamy
head
aroma
is
spices
taste
is
the
same
mixture
of
spiciness
this
feels
good
in
the
mouth
but
that
where
it
stops
imagine
a
teaspoon
of
spiceswater
and
cream
thats
what
youre
pretty
much
getting
here
will
i
buy
again
no
thanks
one
has
nauseated
me
enough
thank
you
appearance
has
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
creamy
head
with
good
retention
smell
is
faint
with
molassas
and
light
malts
taste
is
light
with
malt
and
hops
having
an
earthy
bitterness
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
ale
indeed
thats
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
but
good
smooth
body
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
its
good
for
when
you
want
to
have
a
couple
of
tasty
beers
but
dont
want
to
feel
the
effects
cheers
mfd
another
watery
beer
dammit
this
could
have
had
some
more
thickness
to
it
to
make
it
a
bit
more
substantial
but
perhaps
that
is
something
one
give
up
when
going
nitro
not
always
the
case
i
have
noticed
d
excellent
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
this
was
one
of
the
few
nitro
based
beers
that
i
have
had
and
this
was
a
bit
more
livelier
than
expected
final
thought
the
beer
has
great
elements
just
not
enough
of
them
the
nitrogen
is
unnecessary
and
it
makes
me
crave
a
real
casked
ale
from
england
but
thats
better
than
a
lot
of
these
nitro
cans
the
nitro
widgets
makes
the
beer
look
great
im
a
sucker
for
that
bizarre
head
on
the
down
side
it
seems
to
pull
some
fullness
out
of
the
feel
as
the
nitrogen
subsides
the
nose
is
all
caramel
maybe
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
the
flavors
are
buttery
caramel
biscuit
some
slight
bitter
tartness
and
some
subtle
hops
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
i
can
imagine
how
much
better
a
traditional
english
ale
could
be
and
thats
a
rough
comparison
good
beer
for
the
style
but
theres
not
a
huge
amount
of
high
quality
competition
with
wide
distribution
i
imagine
that
this
beer
could
be
combined
interestingly
with
other
beers
d
not
bad
just
bland
better
than
boddingtons
though
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
i
enjoy
this
and
would
drink
it
again
when
in
the
mood
for
something
simple
the
pour
is
beautiful
thing
to
behold
comes
of
the
can
a
clear
amber
but
with
a
swirling
tan
cloud
of
carbonation
that
verrry
slowly
works
its
way
up
to
a
pitted
cream
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
aromas
are
extremely
subtle
but
enticing
sweet
molasses
and
buttermilk
pancakes
taste
is
okay
biscuity
malts
with
a
dull
earthy
bitterness
that
is
sadly
mediocre
for
such
an
initially
attractive
beer
its
body
unfortunately
is
fatally
flawed
this
beer
feels
more
watery
than
water
an
interesting
beer
that
starts
off
at
a
sprinters
pace
for
excellence
and
quickly
slides
downhill
a
great
beer
to
revisit
easy
drinking
but
it
gets
old
about
14
of
the
way
through
the
pint
mouthfeel
is
smooth
silky
and
very
flat
carbonationwise
compared
to
what
americans
are
used
to
i
like
it
though
makes
for
a
very
sessionable
ale
drinkability
is
fairly
high
its
an
inoffensive
beer
fairly
enjoyable
and
certainly
sessionable
my
can
says
3
6
abv
some
weird
thing
i
noticed
is
the
ba
website
lists
it
as
5
alcohol
the
can
in
the
picture
says
4
4
and
the
can
i
have
says
3
6
so
i
am
unsure
which
one
is
correct
or
if
they
dropped
the
alcohol
content
in
it
either
way
it
is
still
very
good
wonderful
creamy
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
it
finishes
slightly
sweet
slightly
bitter
pretty
good
stuff
and
worthy
of
revisits
this
is
a
fun
beer
that
just
looks
great
i
could
drink
an
average
tasting
and
smelling
beer
if
it
looked
like
this
good
thing
tetleys
other
qualities
arent
that
bad
either

didnt
check
but
im
sure
the

alcohol
detected
in
taste
d
super
easy
drinking
as
all
nitros
are
dont
know
how
much
credit
to
give
the
beer
seems
like
nitrogen
does
most
of
the
work
in
these
things
still
it
is
tasty
and
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
gains
more
flavor
as
it
warms
more
hops
than
most
nitros
good
stuff
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
session
beer
with
some
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
id
like
to
try
this
in
a
nonnitro
version
preferably
in
a
can
so
it
can
survive
the
journey
from
britain
not
likely
to
happen
though
id
say
this
is
like
a
mild
more
than
a
pale
ale
recommended
extremely
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
abv
of
3
6
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
night
and
not
get
too
stupid
not
the
boldest
of
beers
so
it
might
get
boring
after
a
few
i
was
really
pleased
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
on
tap
but
it
was
a
bit
weak
in
my
opinion
if
the
flavors
were
stronger
and
more
pronounced
this
beer
would
have
been
much
more
enjoyable
overall
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
quite
easy
drinking
smooth
and
only
5
abv
a
good
solid
cream
ale
very
easy
to
drink
inexpensive
to
buy
and
not
too
hard
to
find
dont
expect
explosions
of
flavour
though
d
with
such
a
lucious
mouthfeel
low
alcohol
and
mild
flavor
this
is
some
of
the
easiest
drinking
stuff
there
is
a
good
solid
cream
ale
very
easy
to
drink
inexpensive
to
buy
and
not
too
hard
to
find
dont
expect
explosions
of
flavour
and
there
is
very
little
to
dislike
in
this
one
this
guy
suprised
me
a
bit
it
posesses
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
interested
while
that
nitro
blast
gives
this
a
wonderufl
look
and
feel
in
the
mouth
oh
and
did
i
mention
that
this
is
sub
4
im
ready
to
pop
another
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
with
a
wonderful
creaminess
and
is
extremely
mild
and
drinkable
despite
a
dearth
of
real
flavor
very
drinkable
session
beer
that
has
minimal
flavor
for
a
somewhat
quality
beer
nice
to
have
around
ppurchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
an
amber
colored
brew
with
a
big
light
tan
head
the
nose
has
mostly
light
malt
but
some
dry
hops
can
be
found
the
flavor
has
toasted
sweet
malts
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
the
body
is
light
but
clean
and
smooth
this
is
a
good
english
ale
but
not
worth
the
price
they
charge
for
a
four
pack
packaging
i
love
a
can
with
a
widget
but
thats
just
me
it
is
nice
to
note
that
they
tell
you
about
said
widget
right
on
the
cans
nice
bright
colors
it
just
about
shouts
hey
im
a
british
beer
id
say
they
marketers
are
also
trying
to
give
it
the
look
our
label
is
in
an
old
style
weve
been
around
a
long
time
type
of
treatment
d
with
only
3
6
abv
and
a
nitro
widget
how
can
this
be
anything
short
of
easy
and
smooth
to
consume
i
never
do
but
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
gets
its
own
paragraph
while
the
flavor
might
make
me
want
to
switch
to
something
else
after
many
pints
the
smoothness
and
initial
drinkability
in
this
beer
is
not
fair
i
really
mean
it
when
i
say
its
too
easy
to
drink
is
this
what
the
english
drink
at
soccer
matches
great
choice
for
a
session
brew
this
one
opened
with
a
big
rush
of
air
and
bubbles
it
poured
very
foamy
with
loads
of
tiny
little
bubbles
that
slowly
formed
a
thick
white
and
creamy
head
very
cool
looking
the
body
was
a
nice
golden
honey
color
with
good
clarity
after
it
settled
down
the
aroma
is
light
carmel
malts
and
peach
the
favor
is
buttery
smooth
and
malty
sweet
up
front
this
fades
to
an
odd
watery
and
metallic
middle
that
finishes
with
some
herbal
tea
like
hops
the
palate
is
velvety
smooth
and
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
grate
looking
beer
not
much
flavor
tetleys
is
interesting
however
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
i
tried
this
beer
by
itself
and
with
food
and
i
suggest
it
be
tasted
with
food
as
well
that
compensates
for
the
total
lack
of
flavor
and
takes
advantage
of
the
watery
nature
mfd
smooth
creamy
just
as
the
can
reads
a
little
watery
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
carbonation
great
session
ale
i
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
flavor
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
top
it
began
making
hissing
noises
as
though
something
were
angry
inside
and
looking
to
escape
i
was
happy
to
help
and
as
i
poured
i
got
a
lovely
cascading
action
as
the
pour
eventually
settled
into
a
fingers
worth
of
solid
eggshellwhite
head
the
beer
was
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
slightly
caramellike
perhaps
buttery
but
not
in
a
diacetyl
way
lets
stick
with
caramel
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
mild
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
very
smooth
with
a
faint
lingering
hoppiness
after
the
swallow
its
low
abv
makes
it
a
session
candidate
plus
given
its
inexpensive
cost
and
portability
in
a
nitrocan
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
winner
d
very
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
beers
well
balanced
all
around
with
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
wish
i
had
stumbled
onto
it
sooner
reminded
me
of
boddingtons
only
a
bit
smoother
da
good
beer
to
sit
down
with
and
have
a
few
d
a
nice
light
flavorful
beer
i
could
happily
drink
this
on
many
occasions
the
can
i
have
is
marked
3
6
abv
and
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
poured
from
a
widget
can
always
fun
to
watch
the
cascade
turns
out
a
nice
light
brown
with
a
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
initially
banana
like
with
some
sweet
malty
notes
the
taste
is
light
and
malty
not
very
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
this
is
a
nonoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
brew
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
d
quite
drinkable
almost
too
the
light
body
and
low
abv
makes
this
go
down
easy
its
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
keep
around
the
house
this
was
from
a
widgetcan
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
cascading
head
that
was
reminiscent
of
a
goldencolored
guinness
after
that
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
with
the
blandness
of
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
very
easy
drinking
but
definitely
lacking
in
character
pours
a
wonderful
amber
with
great
head
and
nice
lacing
it
almost
seemed
tritoned
for
a
brief
moment
excellent
scent
a
headyearthy
aroma
good
taste
a
nice
spicy
maltiness
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
its
not
the
strongest
tasting
ale
but
very
light
and
pleasing
goes
down
very
smoothly
its
a
very
creamy
ale
d
this
is
a
decent
representation
of
a
classic
english
pub
ale
its
low
abv
decently
light
body
and
smooth
texture
makes
it
easy
to
throw
back
it
would
certainly
make
an
excellent
session
beer
as
you
could
probably
have
6
of
them
before
you
even
feel
anything
however
its
not
my
favourite
style
so
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
buying
it
again
in
the
near
future
i
would
like
to
try
boddingtons
version
of
this
style
however
overall
i
was
hoping
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
but
i
just
dont
get
anything
in
it
its
not
bad
but
not
for
me
if
in
the
mood
for
something
similar
i
would
rather
grab
a
boddingtons
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
nitros
but
this
one
was
so
smooth
that
i
found
myself
quaffing
it
down
quite
easilly
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
and
i
was
very
happy
with
it
i
didnt
get
the
watered
down
taste
that
i
have
had
with
others
like
it
its
low
abc
of
3
6
makes
this
beer
ideal
for
sessions
and
its
going
to
become
one
of
my
new
favorites
highly
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
even
though
this
style
should
be
cooperative
and
well
behaved
in
the
mouth
this
is
extremely
thin
and
uneventful
if
it
werent
for
the
wad
of
foam
slamming
into
my
teeth
on
that
last
gulp
i
would
have
had
to
call
the
texture
police
the
drinkability
factor
is
terrific
i
could
easily
quaff
six
of
these
godzilla
cans
in
a
single
bound
lovely
for
what
it
is
i
would
gladly
enjoy
this
again
mouthfeel
was
average
a
little
sharper
towards
the
end
but
not
over
powering
or
unpleasant
in
any
way
ruby
colored
but
to
me
was
comparable
to
boddingtons
definitely
worth
a
try
would
buy
again
good
change
of
pace
very
creamy
and
thick
on
the
palate
especially
the
head
the
body
is
creamy
but
not
particularly
viscous
the
carbonation
is
mellow
due
to
the
tiny
nitrobubbles
the
finish
is
clean
and
semidry
not
to
terribly
exciting
but
better
in
my
opinion
than
others
advised
pours
a
sudsy
light
amber
with
a
dense
thick
white
head
aroma
is
malty
with
some
dust
and
a
dab
of
pine
taste
is
pretty
simple
malty
and
a
faint
touch
of
citrus
with
a
soapy
bitter
finish
creamy
heavy
body
with
dense
bubbles
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
pretty
straightforeward
this
beer
took
a
little
time
to
grow
on
me
so
its
probably
a
good
thing
the
can
is
nearly
15
oz
one
friend
has
likened
this
beer
to
bath
water
and
with
the
soft
nitro
feel
and
light
flavor
i
can
understand
that
but
disagree
it
had
a
pleasant
mellow
caramel
malt
matched
by
a
longlasting
grassy
hop
bitter
super
smooth
and
i
can
imagine
this
being
quite
nice
from
a
cask
and
fresh
the
beer
poured
a
pleasant
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
nice
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
little
sweetness
and
just
the
tiniest
hops
touch
towards
the
end
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
rather
muted
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
and
very
enjoyable
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
could
imagine
putting
back
quite
a
few
d
you
could
drink
this
forever
but
you
might
eventually
get
a
little
bored
and
switch
to
something
more
exciting
if
available
dark
gold
color
with
the
smooth
creamy
nitro
head
faint
nose
of
hay
and
fruit
tastes
like
plain
biscotti
with
a
mild
fruitiness
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
real
rich
and
creamy
nitro
character
aids
in
the
slipdownthethroat
factor
mine
is
one
of
those
3
6
versions
so
this
is
the
real
deal
session
beer
all
night
long
baby
yeah
drinkability
definitely
a
pleasantly
drinkable
session
beer
unless
youve
experienced
real
british
pub
ale
then
this
may
come
as
somewhat
of
an
unpleasant
beer
the
nitro
can
creates
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
head
similar
to
what
youd
experience
with
a
guinness
or
beamish
nitrocan
the
smell
is
malt
bready
some
sweet
notes
as
well
the
lacing
and
retention
are
first
rate
the
carbonation
is
nil
and
im
not
sure
if
i
had
this
on
tap
whether
it
would
come
off
quite
this
flat
or
whether
this
is
the
physics
of
the
nitrocan
the
taste
is
very
smooth
very
flat
somewhat
dry
and
overall
quite
a
light
body
there
is
no
real
hop
characteristic
until
the
very
end
where
it
does
come
through
to
an
extent
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
light
and
somewhat
creamy
on
the
tongue
not
a
bad
beer
but
unless
you
have
an
appreciation
for
the
style
it
could
be
a
real
turnoff
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
it
sure
does
smell
nice
but
its
weakest
area
is
unfortunately
in
the
taste
department
d
with
the
low
abv
its
easy
to
put
back
a
few
of
these
very
similar
overall
to
boddingtons
but
with
a
more
pronounced
hoppiness
in
the
finish
pours
a
orangey
bronze
color
with
a
good
size
off
white
head
that
stays
at
a
14
inch
collar
all
the
way
through
and
leaves
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
fruity
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
rather
watery
thinvery
easy
to
consumemalt
flavoring
with
the
caramel
coming
through
leaving
a
hint
of
bitterness
behind
very
light
body

and
low
carbs

too

polish
these

like
nothinglow

a

you

hard

get
a
buzz
off
of
it
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
enjoyed
it
alot
d
too
drinkable
will
not
be
buying
again
this
is
a
fairly
average
ale
almost
like
a
fairhaired
guinness
but
not
as
much
flavor
it
sure
was
smooth
with
little
carbonation
and
very
low
bitterness
theres
just
not
too
much
to
this
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
slight
hints
of
fruits
i
suppose
and
despite
the
low
abv
3
8
on
the
can
i
had
it
felt
a
bit
filling
give
it
to
your
friends
who
only
like
guinness
and
theyll
probably
enjoy
it
smooth
creamy
i
can
detect
this
has
unfortunately
lost
some
its
strength
as
far
as
the
flavor
profile
is
concerned
tasty
but
thin
it
drops
off
way
too
quick
easy
to
drink
but
i
wont
remember
to
ask
for
this
tomorrow
but
if
you
put
six
in
front
of
me
i
wouldnt
argue
recommended
this
was
presented
in
a
20
oz
imperial
pint
glass
with
a
perfect
pour
and
still
cascading
as
it
was
set
down
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
an
amber
hued
beer
there
isnt
much
smell
going
on
here
just
a
touch
of
malt
is
all
i
can
really
pick
up
the
first
sip
is
very
light
and
very
creamy
and
light
textured
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
slight
maltiness
good
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
d
its
so
mild
that
you
could
drink
many
in
one
sitting
not
too
bad
served
a
nice
pale
orange
with
the
normal
thick
lasting
nitro
head
the
aroma
is
some
mild
earthy
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
but
a
little
week
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
the
nitrogen
makes
for
a
good
smoothness
this
one
was
mildly
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
on
3
pint
night
but
not
something
id
likely
seek
out
again
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
neat
nitro
pour
effect
precipitating
up
the
height
of
the
glass
like
a
curtain
being
raised
settles
to
a
thick
and
dense
creamy
off
white
head
the
beer
is
golden
colored
with
just
a
hint
of
red
at
the
thickest
part
of
the
glass
no
carbonation
really
the
smell
not
so
awesome
hints
of
dirty
corn
and
cardboard
get
in
the
way
of
a
relatively
nice
malty
aroma
the
malty
smell
reminds
me
of
that
in
a
czech
pils
or
a
german
kölsch
the
taste
is
surprisingly
good
despite
the
unfortunate
smell
the
best
parts
of
that
smooth
malt
come
out
and
are
complemented
well
with
a
light
hop
affect
at
the
end
light
and
dry
yet
the
nitro
provides
a
silkysmooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
gets
an
average
because
of
the
dank
aroma
d
low
alcohol
content
so
have
three
or
four
they
just
keep
getting
better
i
give
her
an
a
nothing
remarkable
about
smell
i
have
had
this
beer
a
few
times
now
and
almost
always
wish
it
was
a
tad
hoppier
otherwise
tetleys
has
a
good
taste
a
little
bit
malty
at
times
but
none
the
less
pleasant
good
clean
ending
somehwat
creamy
i
could
sit
here
all
evening
and
drink
these
without
feeling
over
loaded
but
im
sure
that
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
lower
in
alcohol
this
site
says
it
is
5
0
alcohol
by
volume
but
the
can
says
3
8
alcohol
by
volume
not
sure
which
is
right
but
either
way
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
at
3
8
alc
by
volume
this
is
easily
a
sessionable
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
taste
is
pleasant
enough
at
just
5
highly
drinkable
d
a
light
and
tasty
brew
i
could
easily
drink
all
4
pints
i
would
just
like
a
lil
more
carbonation
and
a
some
stronger
flavor
overall
an
excellent
session
brew
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
also
got
to
sample
this
one
on
tap
at
brits
pub
in
minneapolis
the
imperial
british
pint
glass
just
adds
to
the
aura
of
this
delightful
english
ale
this
was
a
good
looking
ale
deep
amber
in
color
with
just
a
hint
of
a
fluffy
head
riding
regally
on
top
smell
reminded
me
of
pub
crawling
around
england
a
definite
malt
presence
with
fruity
notes
taste
was
of
a
traditiontied
english
ale
not
overpowering
but
good
and
refreshing
malty
throughout
with
just
a
note
of
hops
thrown
in
for
good
measure
overall
this
was
just
a
good
beer
if
you
want
a
real
english
ale
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
tetleys
english
ale
was
amber
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
nice
large
creamy
offwhite
head
with
excellent
retention
and
left
lots
of
lacing
stuck
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
malty
and
a
little
fruity
with
some
floral
hops
the
taste
was
light
malt
with
floral
hops
in
the
background
the
finish
was
fairly
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
drinkablity
was
good
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
without
the
nitrogen
can
sez
this
is
only
3
8
abv
and
considering
that
it
has
an
awful
lot
of
character
and
flavor
i
could
drink
it
all
night
d
very
drinkable
sadly
its
mostly
because
of
the
lack
of
complexity
poured
into
a
20
ounce
pint
a
hazy
orange
ish
color
with
a
thick
white
head
has
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
light
fruit
thicker
body
and
a
sweet
taste
this
is
a
very
english
style
ale
light
and
rich
easy
to
drink
and
really
nonoffending
a
good
session
style
ale
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
silky
smooth
onefinger
head
that
just
sits
there
no
matter
what
you
do
you
cannot
disrupt
this
head
i
love
the
way
the
foam
just
sits
there
waiting
waiting
not
moving
awesome
the
aroma
is
lightly
fruity
and
malty
sweet
very
subtle
and
nice
i
get
some
pear
and
banana
scents
here
but
nothing
too
strong
the
taste
is
pleasantly
subdued
as
well
very
british
this
tetleys
nothing
too
wild
on
any
front
but
consistently
pleasing
for
sure
tastes
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
very
yeastybready
in
flavor
with
some
mellowing
hops
hard
at
work
finishes
bitter
and
chalky
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
at
first
but
that
chalkiness
is
hard
to
ignore
at
the
end
on
the
whole
however
id
call
this
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
reminds
me
very
much
of
my
college
semester
abroad
in
england
i
do
love
a
good
english
pale
ale
and
tetleys
nitro
can
doesnt
disappoint
a
good
lighter
english
mild
d
an
extremely
easy
drinking
brew
mild
mannered
but
refined
and
intriguing
very
british
would
go
well
with
a
burger
for
sure
dangerously
easy
to
drink
a
pleasant
english
ale
flavor
is
unified
and
so
smooth
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
are
in
mood
for
something
mild
the
body
on
this
is
getting
mighty
thin
but
it
really
stands
out
as
a
session
drink
one
i
would
enjoy
drinking
throughout
an
evening

or
the
day
for
that
matter
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
this
beer
pours
an
attractive
honey
amber
in
color
and
is
capped
with
the
creamy
and
dense
nitro
head
it
is
a
good
looking
beer
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
beer
even
though
i
felt
that
it
was
stifled
by
the
nitro
head
sweet
biscuity
and
caramel
aromas
are
evident
with
just
a
suggestion
of
the
hops
this
beer
is
just
a
bit
leaning
to
the
bitter
side
but
nicely
balanced
despite
the
smallish
nature
of
this
beer
it
does
not
lack
in
flavor
the
flavors
evident
mimic
the
aromas
and
this
produces
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
i
would
like
to
have
this
beer
on
cask
rather
than
in
the
nitro
bottle
it
is
my
impression
that
it
only
detracts
from
the
overall
sensory
experience
of
this
beer
with
the
exception
of
appearance
seems
to
be
a
good
example
of
style
final
statement
had
previously
in
a
can
and
it
was
terrible
this
draught
version
was
so
highly
drinkable
it
makes
for
a
dangerous
session
beer
ultimately
im
a
bigger
fan
of
north
american
craft
ales
but
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
a
quaffable
mild
english
ale
such
as
this
a
generally
average
english
ale
nothing
impressive
its
quite
lacking
in
some
areas
but
aside
from
the
somewhat
watery
taste
theres
nothing
outrightly
objectionable
ill
pass
in
the
future
most
likely
easy
to
drink
but
then
so
is
water
wont
be
searching
for
this
one
any
time
soon
easy
to
drink
but
i
will
pass
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
in
a
store
the
taste
reminds
me
of
lightly
salted
saltine
crackers
it
feels
a
little
too
flat
for
me
though
not
enough
carbonation
slightly
sweet
a
bit
thin
and
watery
but
creamy
and
easy
enough
to
drink
if
you
like
mild
english
ales
this
could
be
worth
a
try
you
could
probably
drink
these
one
after
another
but
wouldnt
be
too
motivated
to
do
so
okay
but
not
real
interesting
very
light
and
thin
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
bitter
flavor
at
the
start
but
with
a
chemical
aftertaste
that
grows
as
the
beer
warms
flavor
is
very
disappointing
d
medium
drink
so
you
could
drink
a
fair
bit
not
anything
objectionable
but
such
a
mild
flavor
that
its
not
something
i
would
pursue
this
is
a
good
all
around
pale
ale
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
bit
of
amber
and
has
a
nice
head
that
melts
into
some
lovely
lace
the
smell
is
light
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
hops
and
a
hint
of
earthy
fruit
the
taste
is
mild
and
pleasant
with
a
lot
of
creaminess
and
grain
roasted
malts
and
some
alcohol
is
also
noted
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
silky
with
mild
carbonation
an
excellent
ale
for
any
occasion
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
quite
satisfying
goes
down
easy
i
like
to
grab
one
for
a
change
of
pace
d
good
id
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
creamy
and
enjoyable
d
i
dont
love
the
flavour
but
given
its
strength
itd
certainly
be
sessionable
drinkability
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
could
do
without
the
floaties
for
this
style
i
will
try
this
one
again
maybe
this

which
is
typical
of

cans
smells
nice
with
a
mix
of
butterscotch
and
an
old
stock
ale
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
weak
mild
watery
and
like
butterscotch
no
hop
bitterness
at
all
by
the
end
of
the
glass
theres
not
much
left
to
desire
i
could
see
this
beer
going
down
in
a
hurry
in
fact
im
seeing
it
right
now
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
glad
i
picked
it
up
of
course
once
the
bubbles
settle
things
normalize
the
settled
beer
is
a
deep
straw
and
the
thick
head
sticks
around
throughout
the
drink
because
of
the
slight
carbonation
you
can
easily
drink
several
of
these
beers
making
the
beer
a
fine
session
choice
the
smell
is
interesting
but
forgettable
the
taste
is
serious
hops
but
not
flowery
i
had
my
first
tetleys
at
bar
i
frequent
with
a
bunch
of
friends
of
mine
called
mcgregor
food
and
spirits
this
turned
out
to
be
an
decent
brew
not
as
flavorful
as
i
hoped
but
smooth
as
silk
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
and
watched
the
huge
head
quickly
disappear
nitrogen
bubbles
were
tiny
and
a
buddy
of
mine
explained
that
this
quick
deheading
is
called
cascading
as
the
bubble
force
the
beer
to
the
surface
it
has
a
mildly
sweet
taste
but
id
use
this
beer
in
some
sort
of
drinking
game
so
it
can
be
imbibed
swiftly
this
is
a
strong
flavor
english
ale
it
pours
with
a
thick
head
and
the
nitro
can
makes
the
entire
beer
look
white
for
a
few
minites
its
quite
interesting
it
has
a
strong
almost
coffee
like
taste
reminds
me
in
a
way
of
newcastle
brown
ale
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
pub
ale
i
perfer
ti
to
boodingtons
pours
a
slightly
lighter
copper
than
id
anticipated
very
clear
and
with
a
bright
white
head
that
builds
to
nearly
three
fingers
before
dissipating
leaving
some
lacing
smell
is
underwhelming
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
caramel
present
taste
is
fuller
english
hops
providing
a
substantial
bite
and
the
malts
are
caramel
a
bit
fruity
with
some
berries
and
apple
present
a
grainy
note
and
some
diacetyl
impair
the
flavour
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
crisp
and
full
and
drinkability
is
good
not
a
great
bitter
but
entirely
acceptable
i
might
have
it
again
if
i
found
it
somewhere
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
poured
a
reddish
golden
colour
with
a
slight
off
white
head
which
dissipated
rather
quickly
and
left
a
little
lacing
the
smell
was
slight
but
i
picked
up
on
a
fruity
character
and
a
very
sweet
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
enjoyable
sweet
honeycaramel
malt
character
mixed
with
some
spicy
nut
flavors
and
some
mild
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
overall
i
found
the
taste
to
be
well
balanced
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
bitterness
due
to
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
and
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
little
more
body
on
this
as
it
comes
across
a
little
thin
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
enough
to
drink
it
again
but
not
the
best
bitter
ive
had
terribly
downable
and
awfully
likable
a
pub
ale
to
keep
a
smile
on
your
face
even
when
youre
losing
at
darts
all
in
all
tetleys
english
ale
isnt
a
bad
little
beer
like
boddingtons
its
mild
creamy
and
smooth
but
with
a
touch
more
flavour
that
bas
might
be
looking
for
im
not
sure
if
ill
ever
buy
more
but
its
still
certainly
worth
a
try
this
is
a
brew
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
before
my
ba
days
and
it
is
as
wonderful
as
i
remember
it
being
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
tetleys
is
dark
copper
in
color
with
the
typical
slick
creamy
head
produced
by
a
nitro
can
as
expected
retention
is
very
high
aroma
is
a
combination
of
sweet
grainy
malts
mild
herbal
english
hop
and
nitro
can
smell
taste
is
smooth
yet
very
flavorful
this
is
easily
the
best
nitro
can
expirience
i
can
remember
having
sweet
english
malts
are
paired
with
a
very
full
leafy
hop
drinkability
is
very
good
i
wish
we
had
this
in
texas
this
would
probably
be
my
epa
of
choice
i
could
see
this
one
as
a
great
session
beer
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
quite
refreshing
my
review
may
be
a
bit
low
but
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
though
it
is
not
a
great
one
either
its
just
a
bit
too
bland
mouth
not
much
mouthfeel
at
all
in
fact
its
pretty
horrible
like
its
completely
flat
theres
a
nice
light
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
the
front
but
the
terrible
mouthfeel
and
the
addition
of
a
metallic
flavor
make
this
beer
a
real
loser
typical
nitro
pour
after
settling
a
flat
creamy
12
inch
head
stays
on
top
of
a
chillhazed
amber
beer
thick
sheets
of
lace
on
the
glass
some
hops
to
the
aroma
slightly
tart
and
sulfurous
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
with
wellspaced
fine
carbonation
musky
caramel
malt
backdrop
a
little
bit
of
cocoanut
not
a
bad
leafy
hop
balance
to
start
nothing
distinctive
however
slides
into
a
somewhat
watery
finish
while
hanging
on
to
some
residual
sweetness
this
one
has
more
flavor
than
boddingtons
pub
ale
at
least
overall
not
a
bad
session
beer
to
sit
around
and
watch
football
nothing
too
exciting
dear
lord
i
thought
this
was
a
good
tasting
brew
the
appearance
is
medium
brown
with
a
one
inch
white
head
leaves
a
consistent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
is
excellent
smooth
a
little
bitter
and
you
can
really
taste
the
malts
high
drinkability
i
could
have
drank
this
all
night
if
you
havent
tried
it
give
it
a
shot
djust
ok
would
i
have
another
sure
but
would
pick
something
else
if
i
had
a
choice
drinkability
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
low
in
standout
taste
and
very
low
in
alcohol
this
a
very
sessionable
beer
however
i
would
not
likely
seek
out
more
of
this
anytime
soon
because
of
its
simple
taste
refreshing
qualities
and
low
abv
makes
this
quite
drinkable
the
frothy
head
acts
as
a
layer
of
insulation
between
my
nose
and
the
aroma
of
the
beer
but
after
taking
a
sip
i
am
able
to
distinguish
a
malty
grainy
smell
the
taste
is
ever
so
slightly
hoppy
with
a
warm
loaf
of
bread
taste
to
it
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
cozy
taste
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
loud
opening
smooth
pour
resulted
in
a
yellowish
creamy
looking
brew
that
settles
in
moments
to
a
gorgeous
tarnished
bronze
with
a
stubborn
tightly
tinybubbled
head
smell
is
mildly
ashy
almost
the
scent
of
peanut
skins
or
shells
sans
nuts
taste
is
mild
malt
with
a
dash
of
english
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
undermines
the
experience
this
beer
looks
so
delicious
easy
to
quaff
an
alternative
at
parties
and
not
unreasonably
priced
at
1
59
for
the
single
500ml
can
drinkability
one
i
think
is
enough
i
want
something
a
bit
more
substantial
in
taste
and
in
mouthfeel
comments
i
think
this
is
a
good
occasional
english
pale
ale
but
would
not
choose
it
when
given
a
range
of
choices
the
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
i
personally
prefer
more
carbonated
ales
again
good
for
when
looking
for
something
mild
but
dont
anticipate
a
flavor
burst
when
ordering
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
light
on
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
just
as
creamy
as
the
appearance
would
suggest
soooo
creamy
and
smooth
very
nice
quite
drinkable
id
enjoy
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
a
wonderful
find
that
ill
be
sure
to
keep
a
few
spare
of
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
tasty
enough
and
very
very
smooth
drank
this
beer
straight
from
the
nitro
can
at
a
party
taste
is
fairly
bland
but
inoffensive
bit
of
caramel
in
the
taste
mild
hop
flavor
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
unexciting
beer
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
d
this
might
be
an
excellent
beer
to
wash
down
bangers
and
mash
in
some
quaint
village
in
england
but
anywhere
in
the
world
this
is
just
forgettable
swill
this
is
a
pretty
good
english
ale
it
pours
just
a
beautiful
creamy
head
with
even
for
a
nitrocan
the
neargolden
color
of
the
beer
is
also
very
inviting
the
beer
smells
a
lot
more
rich
than
it
tastes
it
smells
of
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
this
is
also
how
it
tastes
also
with
some
buttery
diacetyl
i
find
it
to
be
very
thirstquenching
but
not
really
all
that
satisfying
served
on
a
nitro
tap
after
it
settles
this
is
a
nice
bright
clear
copper
with
a
finger
of
creamy
smooth
offwhite
head
curtains
of
lace
left
behind
nose
is
mutedslight
haylike
grassiness
slight
hint
of
a
malt
not
much
to
smell
taste
is
that
of
a
simple
pale
ale
nice
pale
malts
slightly
caramel
gentle
touch
of
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
somewhat
flat
tasting
just
like
any
nitro
but
with
this
simple
ale
it
works
well
i
love
nitro
beersthey
dont
give
me
gas
like
regular
onesand
i
could
literally
drink
this
nice
little
pale
ale
all
day
long
well
i
dont
like
this
at
all
on
the
nitro
and
i
think
it
would
be
worse
just
in
a
bottle
tall
tan
and
a
thick
white
nitro
head
that
laces
the
whole
fucking
glass
i
dont
really
smell
anything
except
the
memory
of
a
beer
taste
is
a
pale
ale
of
bmc
quality
so
bland
and
at
the
bottom
edge
of
style
that
i
might
as
well
have
got
a
water
this
is
too
thick
for
its
own
good
and
not
something
i
really
care
for
and
i
wont
drink
again
anytime
soon
i
think
possibly
the
only
reason
i
enjoyed
this
beer
was
because
i
just
got
off
work
and
i
was
tired
and
thirsty
and
a
beer
any
beer
really
hit
the
spot
its
basically
like
a
lighter
colored
guinness
if
that
is
your
thing
by
all
means
give
tetleys
a
try
its
not
my
thing
and
i
wont
be
having
this
beer
again
to
me
average
straight
down
the
line
d
im
going
to
go
ahead
and
assume
that
tetleys
is
probably
better
from
the
cask
cause
this
nitro
can
is
really
bland
at
3
8
this
is
definitely
intended
for
a
session
but
theres
way
better
stuff
out
there
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
any
more
of
this
a
cheap
and
simple
bitter
from
the
carlsberg
group
i
enjoyed
tetleys
english
ale
because
it
has
a
creamy
taste
without
feeling
like
you
drank
a
glass
of
milk
the
ale
lacks
complexity
and
any
fruit
character
so
it
is
not
a
beer
to
excite
me
i
suppose
its
boring
without
being
offensive
at
first
i
liked
this
but
the
more
i
tried
it
the
less
i
was
a
fan
typically
i
dont
mind
nitrogen
widget
canned
beers
but
this
just
seemed
to
take
away
from
the
ale
itself
i
think
it
works
for
stouts
but
here
it
just
seemed
to
come
up
short
review
done
from
notes
very
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
sugary
sweet
with
a
touch
of
butter
and
caramel
toasted
grains
with
a
mini
hop
snap
on
the
finish
as
with
any
nitro
can
ive
ever
had
this
has
a
good
drinkability
level
that
deserves
to
be
noted
overall
a
solid
offering
for
this
style
its
very
drinkable
but
go
for
a
boddingtons
for
a
richer
more
satisfying
epa
a
very
drinkable
product
unbalanced
acidic
and
burnt
taste
and
the
almost
chalky
finish
lingers
a
slightly
burnt
grapefruit
flavor
maybe
i
got
a
crap
can
but
this
stuff
was
crap
no
carbonation
what
so
ever
tasted
like
lightly
hopped
tea
with
a
sickenly
sweet
aftertaste
terrible
avoid
poured
an
explosive
medium
copper
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
blustery
head
that
lasted
throughout
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
caramel
taste
is
nice
with
toasted
grains
and
a
nice
finishing
dryness
nice
and
easy
to
drink
but
one
is
enough
nothing
special
i
am
convinced
if
you
put
coors
light
on
nitro
id
probably
like
it
this
one
pours
a
standard
yellow
with
a
white
haze
from
the
nitro
smells
slight
on
all
categories
malt
hop
yeast
vegetable
tastes
creamy
malty
sweet
albeit
very
light
mild
hops
give
a
plesant
souring
effect
body
is
creamy
and
a
wee
bit
grainy
finishes
clean
crisp
and
a
little
watery
after
the
nitro
disipates
slight
tones
of
diacety
are
present
in
the
finish
again
a
good
session
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable

appearance
is
amber
with
a
nice
foam
that
has
some
lace
hops
give
a
flowery
and
light
aroma
initial
taste
has
both
malt
and
hops
the
hops
predominate
to
the
finish
which
is
a
little
bitter
there
is
some
diacetyl
that
coats
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
lingering
impression
of
margarine
interesting
sensation
all
in
all
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
english
pale
ale
id
like
to
think
the
nitrogen
would
have
made
this
a
more
interesting
brew
but
thats
not
to
be
the
case
this
time
good
amount
of
malt
for
the
style
pairs
well
with
the
english
hop
bitterness
clean
hops
in
the
finish
nice
light
mouthfeel
good
session
beer
thoroughly
unimpressive
truly
a
smooth
ride
that
sticks
just
a
bit
could
session
this
all
day
long
with
no
problem
after
working
your
way
through
the
cream
on
top
you
have
a
smooth
feeling
liquid
and
light
malty
flavor
in
your
mouth
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
but
it
doesnt
give
you
much
flair
very
filling
and
great
over
conversation
at
the
bar
but
if
you
want
more
than
one
it
seems
like
you
want
a
lot
of
time
to
work
on
them
the
taste
was
ok
i
think
here
they
undermine
carbonation
a
bit
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
although
watery
and
seems
to
lack
something
despite
it
all
bitter
well
just
at
the
end
but
ill
take
plenty
ipas
or
apas
if
i
actually
want
the
bitter
this
is
just
a
decent
mild
beer
you
could
just
find
in
any
pub
here
this
is
a
nice
easy
to
drink
mild
english
ale
which
is
wellbalanced
and
without
imposing
offflavors
that
i
tend
to
dislike
in
most
english
ales
thank
god
an
english
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
wet
cardboard
or
butter
i
like
this
one
pleasantly
surprised
i
would
drink
this
again
would
be
great
ice
cold
on
a

day
in

watch

eventually
clears

if
it
is

not

and
full

is

easy
enough
to

but
not
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
pop
the
nitro
can
and
hear
the
rush
of
the
widget
breaking
pours
a
nice
golden
hue
topped
by
a
oneinch
creamy
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
nice
cascading
slightly
sweet
aroma
at
first
but
upon
closer
inspection
theres
a
hint
of
sour
cheap
adjunct
malt
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
but
whats
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
mild
hops
and
light
malt
body
is
a
bit
thin
with
almost
no
carbonation
decent
especially
for
the
price
pours
into
the
glass
as
a
opaque
milky
colored
liquid
which
transforms
into
clear
russetamber
liquid
topped
with
a
compact
creamy
ivory
head
the
nose
is
lighty
fruitycandylike
sweet
the
taste
is
bittersweet
and
somewhat
fruity
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
good
hop
bitterness
with
a
somewhat
tealike
astringency
which
complements
the
fruitiness
quite
nicely
finishes
bittersweet
and
very
easy
to
drink
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
some
time
this
sample
is
from
a
nitrocan
color
is
a
gold
and
copper
a
nice
creamy
head
smell
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
taste
like
so
many
other
english
pale
ales
is
very
well
balanced
but
the
smooth
malt
flavor
does
linger
over
the
hops
drinkability
is
awsome
when
i
first
started
digging
into
this
4pack
i
was
wondering
if
the
abv
was
around
4
because
it
was
so
easy
to
drink
but
they
say
its
5
and
that
makes
me
happy
taste
isnt
offensive
just
bland
hard
to
detect
anything
but
the
malt
a
pretty
boring
taste
but
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
nice
a
good
quaffing
beer
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
not
much
on
the
nose
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
very
easily
some
buttery
lip
smacking
aftertaste
a
nice
sessionable
brew
but
not
one
id
likely
buy
again
well
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
pardon
the
pun
mouthfeel
is
thin
surprisingly
thin
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
special
from
a
nitro
can
from
the
corner
store
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
good
for
a
cheap
beer
the
beer
poured
wigolden
with
a
rich
creamy
head
which
made
the
mouthfeel
wonderful
very
creamy
in
character
the
aroma
was
only
slightly
malty
with
some
hops
barely
showing
up
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
makes
up
for
it
one
complaint
is
the
chemical
taste
in
the
aftertaste
just
not
quite
right
there
still
for
a
cheap
session
beer
i
would
take
this
any
day
all
day

a
small

that
is
more

due

this
is
a
very

bitter
if
a
little

lacking
in

id
recommend
it
quite

to
find
this
at

one
of
the
weaker
aspects
of
this

everything
was
really

a

linger
taste
had
nice
notes
of
pine

hay
followed
by
a

and
drinkability
are
both
obviously
high
i
actually
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
more
than
i
do
boddingtons
unquestionably
this
was
a
great
find
in
a
pretty
beer
deprived
city
this
beer
isnt
particularly
stunning
in
any
category
but
decently
balanced
overall
making
it
easy
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
a
bright
clean
dark
golden
beer
has
a
rich
spoonable
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
anice
lace
i
always
have
a
hard
time
getting
any
aroma
out
of
any
nitro
beer
the
head
is
so
thick
it
hard
to
pick
up
much
through
it
i
did
manage
to
get
a
light
sweetness
in
the
aroma
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
good
bitterness
followed
by
a
light
applely
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
nicely
balanced
hop
finish
that
has
an
almost
tea

character
taste
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
watery
a
the

slightly
bitter
with

bitterness
stays

sticks
around

for

it
was
a
gift

light
bitter
with
some
malt
in
the
back
taste
is
quite
weak
with
some
bitterness
but
also
a
watery
feeling
that
was
quite
a
letdown
probably
below
your
average
english
bitter
consumed
from
the
16oz

poured
just
as
i
expected

with

beautiful

didnt
have
much
nose
to
it
a
bit
of
a
bitter
smell
tasted
a
bit
bland
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
went
down
very
smooth
a
decent
beer
but
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
the
colours
kind
of
a
light
gold
and
brown
sort
of
looks
like
it
could
be

lasted

is
where
the
positive

nothing
about

overall
a
really

english
pale
ale
not
much
love
on

sites
but
i
quite
enjoyed
it
it
was
a
fairly
good
beer
o
i
like
the
restrained
flavor
its
ok
if
you
want
a
light
beer
earthy
i
thought
woody
really
good
after
i
tasted
it
didnt
think
much
of
the
smell
kind
of
overripe
allinall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
representative
of
an
ale
pleasant
easily
drinkable
epa
with
fine
balance
of
malty
notes
with
the
barest
hint
of
hops
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
overall
a
good
representative
of
the
style
quite
citrusy
on
top
well
bodied
refreshing
probably
not
a
bad
summer
beer
actually
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
a
little
subdued
but
i
got
some
citrus
from
the
hops
and
then
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
the
taste
was
rather
refreshing
but
a
bit
forgettable
some
mellow
hops
in
the
beginning
with
a
malt
finish
for
a
clean
aftertaste

o

this
brewer
is
underrated
cask
dry
hopped
with

i
think
much
more
flavorful
and
better
mouthfeel
than
the
bottled
version
they
should
stick
to
serving
this
on
cask
overall
decent
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
to
get
all
excited
about
if
in
the
mood
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
id
have
it
again
just
wouldnt
go
seeking
it
out
o
i
think
that
this
would
be
easily
accepted
by
someone
that
is
used
to
american
adjunct
lagers
the
taste
profile
is
similar
enough
to
be
approachable
that
is
kind
of
he
nicest
thing
i
can
say
it
felt
overly
carbonated

was

mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
milder
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
a
pale
golden
body
with
decent
head
and
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
more
akin
to
butterscotch
than
caramel
and
there
are
some
oily
hops
in
this
beer
beer
is
light
bodied
and
doesnt
have
much
going
on
to
be
kind
as
the
hops
are
oily
and
bitter
with
not
too
much
of
a
flavor
profile
and
the
malts
are
sweet
and
noticeable
but
overpowered
not
too
much
to
add
other
than
this
is
just
a
bland
basic
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
dingy
cloudy
amber
color
the
beer
had
a
pretty
small
head
the
beer
smelled
like
it
was
going
to
be
really
hoppy
and
i
caught
a
hint
of
honey
the
beer
was
slightly
hoppy
but
not
too
much
it
was
bout
like
a
sam
adams
i
liked
the
beer
even
though
it
was
ipa
ish
i
would
buy
again
like
the
label
says
it
pours
brass
in
color
but
with
a
minimal
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flashsomewhat
dull
in
appearance
aromas
of
caramel
malts
and
leafy
green
english
hopsi
dont
get
much
of
the
cascades
but
do
get
a
whiff
of
the
goldings
and
fuggles
the
feel
is
lighter
with
not
much
carbonationon
the
flatter
side
caramelbiscuit
flavors
with
underlying
herbal
notes
on
the
palatepretty
unassuming
really
i
guess
it
isnt
bad
for
the
style
but
ill
just
go
and
by
a
landlord
if
i
want
a
true
epa
overall
clean
and
well
made
as
would
expect
from
heavy
seas
but
didnt
love
it
i
think
a
little
more
maltiness
would
balance
the
flavors
and
slightly
less
carbonation
would
enhance
its
drinkability
o
mediocre
pale
ale
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
translucent
light
amber
red
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
floral
and
piney
hops
slight
citrus
tastes
of
watery
malt
profile
with
slight
floral
hop
taste
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
but
still
goes
down
alright
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
a
clear
but
dark
copper
color
with
a
substantial
white
head
that
doesnt
quit
leaving
decent
lace
trails
the
aroma
is
a
bit
um
english
with
a
somewhat
funky
herbal
hop
idea
mellow
and
not
greatly
attractive
to
me
but
not
bad
the
taste
brings
pleasant
herbal
hops
with
a
hint
of
muted
citrus
a
little
pineapple
perhaps
and
bready
toffee
ideas
kind
of
slinky
as
english
hops
seem
to
accomplish
the
body
is
medium
plus
with
a
delicate
carbonation
and
a
creamy
feel
o
not
bad
wellmade
but
lacking
in
any
distinct
flavors
on
draft
the
beer
is
orange
and
mostly
clear
with
a
thin
off
white
collar
the
aroma
offers
dank
hops
biscuits
grain
a
touch
of
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
toffee
relatively
light
in
body
with
lingering
pine
bitterness
this
pour
was
nice
and
fresh
nothing
outstanding
here
but
this
was
by
far
the
best
option
at
the
time
overall
not
really
worth
purchasing
again
in
fact
i
dont
care
for
the
style
much
but
i
tend
to
try
everything
heavy
seas
puts
out
the
feel
is
bright
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
leafy
tealike
dryness
in
a
lightmedium
body
leaning
lighter
o
decent
pale
ale
nothing
really
special
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
perhaps
but
pretty
boring
and
low
key
i
much
prefer
american
pale
ales
to
english
ones
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
the
taste
is
not
special
it
is
not
as
dark
tasting
or
as
bitter
as
many
of
this
style
but
it
has
a
great
balance
the
aftertaste
is
very
nice
it
lingers
on
the
tongue
with
a
nice
little
bit
of
bitter
i
would
buy
this
again
or
be
happy
with
it
from
a
sampler
such
as
this
was
pours
a
beautiful
copper
amber
with
perfect
clarity
and
an
excellent
head
of
foam
that
fell
sweetly
to
a
layer
of
bubbles

a

a
touch

and
as
it
warms
some
lemon
and
floral
taste
is
subtle
and

malt
is
forward
and
the
hops
are
bitter
very
simple
nothing
fancy
here
and
no
complexity
a
moment
of
yeast
on
the
tongue
gives
way
quickly
hops
are
earthy
and
the
malt
stays
sweet
and

the
bitter
is
sharp

not
explosive

nothing

a
nice
english

pale
ale
overall
can
be
a
real
good
beer
on
cask
as
they
often
add
fresh
hops
not
as
impressive
on
its
own
but
perhaps
a
good
intro
for
someone
not
hop
crazy
o
highly
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
at
under
5
nothing
more
nothing
less
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
balanced
beer
with
a
satisfying
hops
presence
balance
against
some
malt
character
this
is
a
rather
simple
pale
ale
its
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
but
the
flavor
lacks
and
depth
i
was
bored
with
this
beer
but
it
would
make
for
a
great
bmc
replacement
beer
for
the
newly
craftinitiated
yeah
its
just
ok
out
of
the
bottle
cold
cellar
temp
knocks
it
up
a
point
in
flavor
and
aroma
on
tap
it
is
another
ball
game
this
has
been
far
and
away
the
most
popular
draft
beer
i
have
sold
in
my
40
year
restaurant
career
so
far
it
just
fit
the
old
colonial
early
american
atmosphere
of
my
tavern
so
well
it
was
a
natural
o
a
truly
great
beer
can
stand
the
test
of
time
unless
theyre
hoppy
natch
and
this
hasnt
if
you
still
see
this
at
your
neighborhood
liquor
store
and
youre
considering
picking
this
up
dont
do
it
get
something
else
instead
o
i
dont
want
to
completely
trash
this
beer
but
i
simply
do
not
understand
its
appeal
in
my
opinion
whitbread
is
onedimensional
and
lacking
in
balance
a
blast
from
the
past
and
a
timely
reminder
of
how
much
bottled
beer
in
britain
has
improved
in
recent
years
the
beer
is
a
light
brown
in
color
with
some
orange
in
there
too
the
head
is
pretty
good
too
its
got
a
nice
tan
color
to
it
the
aroma
that
this
beer
has
is
something
really
good
to
me
something
that
im
unsure
of
how
to
describe
it
smells
sweet
and
really
enjoyable
its
gotta
be
what
ever
malts
theyve
used
in
this
beer
the
taste
also
carries
over
that
sweetness
and
coats
your
mouth
with
some
really
nice
sweet
malts
i
wish
i
knew
what
they
put
in
this
because
it
reminded
me
of
my
childhood
somehow
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
a
little
watery
but
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
without
a
doubt
whitbread
pale
ale
is
a
solid
session
beer
give
this
one
a
try
got
this
from
a
friend
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
one
finger
white
lace
that
leaves
quickly
alot
of
carbonation
after
the
pour
nothing
disernable
in
either
the
smell
or
taste
very
bland
in
my
opinion
i
am
glad
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
however
it
will
be
the
only
time
not
much
complexity
to
this
brew
but
makes
for
a
strong
sessionable
beer
all
in
all
i
love
this
beer
malts
malts
and
more
malts
very
drinkable
a
muddy
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
fair
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
brown
sugar
sour
mash
combo
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
a
mild
jack
daniels
sweetness
and
subtle
maple
butterscotch
theme
a
nice
midland
body
brew
with
decent
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
the
english
pale
is
a
little
different
than
most
american
pale
ales
not
the
same
hop
bitterness
but
quite
decent
in
this
example
poured
a
very
dark
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
nose
is
deep
malt
nose
little
hops
taste
is
fruity
a
bit
chewy
and
malty
but
lacks
any
real
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
coating
chewy
and
tasty
very
drinkable
and
easy
drinking
this
is
an
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
different
smell
different
taste
if
they
could
fix
the
mouth
on
this
this
may
be
more
drinkable
for
me
drinkability
not
bad
but
really
worth
mentioning
conclusion
not
a
home
run
by
any
means
a
bit
drier
and
it
would
have
been
much
better
this
would
be
a
pretty
solid
englishstyle
pale
with
an
interesting
character
if
not
for
the
somewhat
odd
tart
fruit
on
the
finish
definitely
more
character
than
bass
though
d
this
to
me
is
just
an
average
beer
perhaps
ive
grown
accustomed
to
the
hopped
american
styles
as
opposed
to
the
english
styles
either
way
its
not
bad
i
dont
think
its
great
overall
full
flavored
and
tasty
tasted
very
fresh
a
good
session
ale
d
yet
another
beer
im
torn
over
its
quite
drinkable
as
is
the
problem
is
that
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
well
at
all
i
guess
i
best
split
the
difference
with
the
scoring
on
this
one
d
easily
drinkable
abv
right
in
line
and
the
flavors
are
muted
carbonation
on
the
low
side
limits
stomach
filling
unimpressive
the
first
sip
tasted
quite
good
but
it
subsequently
became
more
boring
not
a
bad
beer
by
all
means
i
could
probably
drink
this
stuff
all
night
if
given
the
opportunity
im
a
sucker
for
english
ales
but
there
are
definitely
better
bitters
out
there
overall
this
beer
was
ok
nothing
i
would
seak
out
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
just
boring
even
for
a
pale
d
not
bad
session
beer
to
enjoy
but
it
is
filling
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
a
game
pretty
good
frothy
head
continuous
ringer
left
behind
with
froth
around
the
glass
amber
color
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
be
for
a
pale
sweet
malty
caramel
with
a
bit
of
the
hops
coming
through
at
the
front
not
much
left
in
the
after
scent
of
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
was
not
impressive
but
not
bad
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
drinks
pretty
well
but
its
quite
atypical
for
a
pale
ale
quite
malty
and
sweet
interesting
but
it
just
seems
a
little
unfocused
medium
body
semisweet
finish
that
lingered
a
bit
i
gave
higher
points
for
drinkability
as
i
could
knock
a
bunch
back
but
only
because
it
lacks
punch
and
tons
of
deep
flavor
making
it
a
bit
easier
drinking
considering
the
style
not
a
favorite
but
not
the
worst
ive
had
with
all
that
said
its
no
surprise
that
drinkability
also
sits
as
decidedly
decent
i
wouldnt
pick
up
a
sixpack
but
you
could
do
much
much
worse
than
whitbreads
pale
ale
bottom
line
try
it
you
will
like
it
if
you
can
find
it
d
a
unique
yeast
profile
is
what
distinguishes
it
from
several
of
its
peers
and
also
produces
a
classic
session
beer
overall
a
good
pale
alcohol
taste
is
a
bit
strong
in
my
opinion
for
this
style
but
good
flavor
decent
atmosphere
good
quaff
d
i
am
surprised
at
how
much
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
and
will
try
this
one
again
the
taste
is
a
tad
bit
less
than
what
the
aroma
reveals
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
a
bit
chewy
with
loads
of
sweet
caramel
malts
there
is
definitely
a
full
palate
of
fruity
maltiness
a
very
bready
backbone
to
the
beer
balanced
out
pretty
nicely
by
traditional
noble
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
a
butterscotch
diacetyl
characteristic
that
diminishes
the
taste
to
a
degree
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
higher
abv
than
its
5
7
given
it
slightly
thick
and
slightly
cloyingly
sweet
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
texture
there
is
perhaps
a
raisiny
note
or
two
towards
the
finish
the
beer
is
defined
by
its
sweet
caramel
malts
its
malty
fruitiness
the
noble
hops
and
the
diacetyl
lurking
throughout
this
is
a
nice
pale
ale
a
bit
stonger
than
one
might
expect
but
full
of
character
and
worth
seeking
out
i
got
this
beer
in
a
variety
pack
from
world
market
this
wasnt
a
bad
ale
but
it
was
not
great
either
i
was
expecting
more
from
it
i
would
try
this
again
to
see
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
in
the
pack
but
i
would
not
rush
to
specifically
look
for
it
the
aroma
is
malty
with
diacytle
yeast
effects
there
is
also
plenty
of
hops
toffee
and
leaves
the
appearance
is
amber
with
an
average
sized
foamy
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sour
dough
the
palate
is
thick
and
smooth
overall
i
like
this
one
and
its
one
of
the
better
easy
to
find
beers
after
reading
the
label
and
looking
here
i
confirmed
my
initial
suspician
that
this
english
pale
ale
had
not
been
brewed
in
the
mother
country
what
tipped
me
off
initially
was
the
fancy
screw
off
cap
which
screamed
domestic
considering
the
value
of
this
beer
i
was
not
upset
that
its
contract
brewed
here
in
the
states
but
after
sampling
i
got
upset
that
apparantly
this
beer
is
rushed
through
production
this
is
indicitive
of
the
extremely
noticeable
diacetyl
aroma
and
flavor
now
the
buttery
affect
from
the
diacetyl
isnt
completely
offsetting
to
me
in
fact
i
sort
of
enjoyed
this
taste
in
the
brews
ive
sampled
from
shipyard
brewing
its
very
prominant
and
almost
overpowering
in
this
beer
though
this
one
looks
decent
in
the
pint
glass
nice
copper
color
small
fizzy
white
head
with
decent
lacing
creamy
and
nicely
satisfying
mouthfeel
lightly
hopped
even
for
an
english
pale
ale
perhaps
more
hops
would
help
offset
the
boring
buttery
flavor
one
sixer
and
done
for
me
medium
watery
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
aroma
has
some
diacetyl
and
apple
juice
along
with
caramel
maltiness
flavor
is
english
toffee
malt
with
a
touch
of
darker
fruits
and
a
nice
appreciable
earthy
hop
finish
not
a
lot
of
bitterness
but
nice
and
dry
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
heft
to
it
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
little
wateriness
not
bad
at
all
its
very
enjoyable
quite
tasty
and
overall
the
character
is
amostly
winey
raisiny
spicy
sweetsourtart
fruit
quality
throughout
with
a
very
lkight
leafy
bitterness
its
highly
drinkable
and
light
but
with
a
creamy
feel
md
feels
and
drinks
like
high
quality
mineral
water
d
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
from
time
to
time
drinkability
is
good
on
this
beer
more
than
one
would
make
for
a
nice
afternoon
wow
this
was
blended
well
and
very
easilly
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
session
of
these
easilly
despite
the
abv
ill
be
getting
more
d
i
could
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
at
all
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
easy
easy
easy
to
drinkbut
the
same
way
chocolate
milk
is
not
enough
bite
or
distinctive
flavor
for
me
however
harmless
and
quite
filling
i
personally
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
d
average
drinkability
being
fruity
dry
but
overall
worth
a
try
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
darker
tan
than
what
i
usually
expected
of
a
pale
ale
with
a
slim
frothy
head
smell
revealed
a
very
buttery
aroma
with
a
strong
malt
overtone
the
best
description
of
the
taste
i
can
give
is
that
of
a
caramel
richnonsweet
butterscotch
flavor
overall
i
find
this
to
be
an
excellent
pale
ale
but
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
could
indulge
in
a
great
beer
to
experience
in
single
offerings
smooth
and
crisp
this
is
a
very
simple
and
drinkable
beer
serving
type
bottle
with
a
lot
of
the
english
elements
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
wish
it
had
a
stronger
hop
presence
finish
brings
in
some
hop
bitterness
that
takes
over
once
the
biscuitbread
goes
into
the
background
medium
to
light
bodied
md
the
feel
is
sticky
and
smooth
the
carbonation
is
there
but
its
light
and
doesnt
add
much
tingle
i
would
gladly
down
a
full
6
pack
of
this
the
sweetness
could
get
to
you
ventually
though
a
clean
and
refreshing
brew
that
doesnt
skimp
out
on
flavor
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
amber
brew
with
thin
white
head
smells
slightly
caramelly
malty
taste
very
malty
slightly
tart
in
the
end
really
low
in
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
drinkablility
is
pretty
good
not
really
too
high
in
alcohol
an
ok
beer
ive
had
better
english
pale
ales
a
little
too
tart
for
me
head
dissapates
rather
quickly
and
gives
way
to
an
amber
orangish
color
smells
of
white
breads
slight
yeast
and
some
hops
in
the
background
hops
bitterness
with
a
slight
breadsy
taste
and
almost
muted
citrus
pretty
much
a
lightermedium
mouthfeel
pretty
good
drinkability
malt
comes
a
little
more
as
it
warms
a
decent
english
style
beer
for
the
states
though
certainly
not
the
best
example
you
could
find
worldwide
also
the
alcohol
is
way
to
high
and
apparent
here
to
make
it
a
session
beer
dat
first
sip
this
beer
seemed
okbut
it
really
missed
the
markbig
time
from
the
middle
to
the
finishi
will
try
other
styles
by
samuel
whitbreadbut
you
would
have
to
be
pretty
sneaky
to
get
me
to
drink
this
pale
ale
again
d
reasonably
drinkable
but
it
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
the
bitterness
is
harsh
and
unpleasant
drinkability
if
it
wasnt
for
the
corny
flavor
this
might
be
good
a
robust
bready
taste
that
is
a
mix
of
some
hops
and
dry
malts
and
even
a
sharp
acidicness
a
fullbodied
beer
that
went
down
easily
but
still
left
a
dry
and
smokey
finish
the
hops
are
used
pretty
good
here
and
overall
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
drinking
again
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
a
nice
example
of
a
pale
ale
d
a
decent
beer
i
would
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
pale
ales
ive
had
but
i
admit
i
havent
had
the
privilege
of
trying
a
lot
of
what
the
world
has
to
offer
just
yet
i
could
easily
see
this
replacing
bass
as
my
goto
english
pale
ale
on
account
of
the
price
tag
if
for
no
other
reason
d
have
it
all
the
time
its
good
a
fine
example
of
an
english
pale
ale
its
clean
and
refreshing
goes
well
on
its
own
in
warm
or
cold
weather
as
a
social
beer
and
with
food
pretty
versatile
and
always
refreshingly
tasty
just
dont
drink
it
expecting
to
be
blown
away
just
relax
and
enjoy
the
bottle
was
drinkable
but
this
was
nothing
too
special
for
me
d
all
night
long
this
is
a
pale
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
yet
not
boring
like
other
session
beers
an
uninteresting
beer
kind
of
weak
in
the
flavor
department
i
dont
think
there
is
anything
here
that
makes
the
beer
have
any
true
character
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
style
but
overall
i
consider
it
just
an
ordinary
beer
amber
pour
with
little
offwhite
head
light
smell
or
sourness
caramel
and
a
metallicness
to
it
as
well
same
tastes
sour
caramel
and
metal
but
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
hops
as
the
description
states
boring
bland
and
possibly
a
bit
past
its
prime
for
this
particular
bottle
world
market
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
best
place
to
get
fresh
beer
thanks
to
ratebeer
com
however
for
the
midi
version
of
the
song
another
one
bites
the
dust
in
celebration
of
my
200th
rating
on
my
last
beer
drinkability
is
very
high
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
good
session
beer
the
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
was
good
and
strong
of
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
if
very
biscuity
with
a
dry
hop
finish
that
has
a
floral
edge
to
it
the
feel
is
nice
and
wet
with
a
good
dry
finish
quite
nice
a
very
nice
beer
i
can
see
setting
up
a
session
or
two
with
this
one
pours
a
translucent
amber
brown
the
head
is
medium
and
offwhite
it
fades
away
pretty
quickly
smells
of
english
malt
with
a
yeasty
character
taste
is
malty
buttery
with
a
hint
of
tea
there
is
a
good
amount
of
bittering
hops
to
round
things
out
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
carbonation
levels
are
slightly
high
for
the
style
but
otherwise
good
pretty
drinkable
not
really
a
session
ale
in
the
british
sense
due
to
its
relatively
high
alcohol
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
not
watery
and
not
overly
carbonated
it
isnt
a
tough
beer
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
have
that
sessionable
feel
that
the
style
should
decent
ale
would
have
another
for
certain
but
the
sweetness
would
get
tired
after
more
than
2
pourd
a
very
nice
dark
auburncopper
color
with
great
head
and
decent
lacing
has
a
very
low
scent
which
seemed
much
too
malty
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
low
taste
hardly
anything
there
not
really
a
hoppiness
maltiness
or
anything
beyond
a
very
weak
almost
water
flavor
went
down
fine
but
not
great
i
doubt
ill
get
any
more
overall
pretty
typical
for
a
british
beer
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
for
me
not
as
good
as
fullers
london
pride
but
i
can
see
bringing
this
into
the
rotation
if
fullers
isnt
availabe
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
light
body
and
is
appropriately
carbonated
nothing
gets
in
the
way
of
this
brews
flavor
profile
the
finish
is
slick
and
leaves
a
slight
warmth
with
the
diacetyl
that
i
am
picking
up
after
a
few
seconds
the
finish
becomes
much
drier
leaving
the
tongue
looking
for
something
to
rehydrate
it
this
is
a
beer
id
not
be
opposed
to
buying
again
however
i
dont
see
anything
that
is
all
that
great
about
it
it
didnt
wow
me
i
find
it
to
be
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
an
overall
good
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
drinkability
une
bonne
bière
pale
ale
même
en
bouteille
the
finish
was
medium
duration
and
pleasant
though
i
never
did
detect
the
bitterness
expected
of
this
style
actually
this
resembled
more
an
english
aleamber
mix
than
an
esb
but
not
a
bad
offering
d
drinkable
i
suppose
but
nothing
about
it
makes
me
want
many
more
it
may
be
a
shade
better
than
bass
though
i
guess
i
just
prefer
a
nice
hoppy
apa
to
this
english
stuff
a
rich
and
malty
epa
but
the
surprisingly
high
abv
may
cut
into
its
drinkability
5
7
is
whopping
for
a
british
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
disolves
almost
immediately
has
a
great
malty
smell
to
it
the
malt
smell
overpowers
everything
almost
like
a
molasses
or
mild
caramel
scent
its
great
as
i
taste
it
its
pretty
darn
good
unlike
most
pale
ales
there
is
no
taste
of
hops
its
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
anything
but
whitbread
has
been
making
it
for
over
260
years
so
i
think
they
know
more
than
me
pretty
good
beer
i
love
me
some
newcastle
and
this
is
somewhat
similar
has
a
nice
smooth
taste
to
it
very
easy
to
drink
im
a
fan
d
highly
quaffable
fruity
and
mild
very
thirst
quenching
and
a
great
example
of
the
english
bitter
style
drinkability
its
certainly
an
atypical
pale
ale
im
all
for
brewers
playing
around
with
styles
but
this
beers
differences
are
not
in
line
with
my
preferences
definitely
in
the
english
style
in
appearance
and
taste
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
off
white
one
finger
head
and
moderate
lacing
mostly
caramel
with
a
slightly
fruity
nose
taste
is
a
little
to
sweet
mostly
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruit
maybe
grapes
come
to
mind
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
my
favorite
beer
to
review
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
the
whitbread
pale
ale
is
a
decent
english
bitter
although
hardly
bitter
tasting
at
all
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
fruity
pears
the
taste
is
dominated
by
pale
malt
that
masks
most
of
the
underlying
styrian
golden
hop
flavors
although
their
presence
does
provide
some
balance
the
wpa
has
a
medium
light
body
and
moderately
low
carbonation
that
is
perfect
for
a
session
beer
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
abv
was
as
high
as
5
7
the
beer
finishes
semidry
and
very
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
decent
english
pale
ale
on
the
upside
the
lack
of
extremes
in
the
brew
make
it
highly
drinkable
especially
in
a
social
setting
where
your
mind
might
be
elsewhere
this
is
not
a
english
pale
ale
but
a
belgian
pale
ale
in
all
but
name
and
a
pretty
average
one
too
beer
only
gets
a
average
from
menot
one
id
buy
or
encourage
my
freinds
to
try
if
i
could
settle
on
a
single
beer
for
a
daily
drinker
this
one
would
be
in
the
running
d
what
do
you
know
i
like
it
can
i
have
another
this
is
a
nice
average
english
beer
brewed
in
the
us
i
like
how
the
label
says
they
use
styrian
golding
hops
probably
because
i
homebrew
and
need
to
know
these
things
it
smells
malty
tastes
malty
and
is
typical
of
an
english
pale
alewow
we
americans
like
hops
in
our
pale
alesand
this
shows
that
they
dont
in
england
i
dont
detect
much
hop
flavor
at
allim
guessing
they
use
styrian
goldings
as
bittering
and
leave
out
flavor
aroma
hops
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
produces
a
medium
head
with
decent
lacing
it
is
unbalanced
since
it
favors
the
maltiness
of
beer
however
the
specialty
malts
used
are
good
and
makes
it
a
better
than
average
beer
not
bad
overall
very
clean
beer
this
beer
is
appropriately
named
as
a
very
unexciting
beer
its
not
bad
but
not
good
its
not
a
beer
youll
remember
very
light
aftertaste
of
fruit
but
not
much
of
one
very
light
aroma
that
isnt
bad
but
not
strong
enough
to
be
exciting
i
cant
really
stress
how
average
this
beer
is
if
a
bar
has
whitbread
on
tap
im
sure
they
have
something
better
on
tap
a
middleoftheroad
brew
sweet
easy
enough
to
drink
but
rather
boring
i
would
like
to
compare
this
to
the
original
english
brew
this
one
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
though
not
bad
cheers
d
being
as
its
pretty
much
just
an
average
beer
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
out
but
if
offered
one
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either

edit
after
reading
a
few
pages
of
reviews
im
puzzled
by
the
mixed
reception
this
beer
has
gotten
to
put
it
kindly
perhaps
there
are
quality
control
issues
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
pleasing
aroma
of
malt
and
grain
with
bittering
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
straighforward
and
pleasing
if
like
me
youre
a
fan
of
traditional
british
ale
not
overly
complex
and
the
finish
is
a
little
flat
but
all
in
all
a
good
english
pale
ale
the
finish
is
so
astringent
and
gummy
that
it
almost
completely
takes
away
from
any
positives
achieved
by
the
consistency
and
carbonation
of
the
drink
i
really
dislike
this
beer
and
am
thankful
trader
joes
has
a
100
satisfaction
policy
on
their
products
because
this
is
going
back
poured
a
light
amber
almost
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
that
fell
and
left
a
thick
lacing
aroma
of
sourdough
bread
and
a
hint
of
rye
but
very
light
overall
somewhat
watery
and
highly
carbonated
left
an
odd
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
have
another
definite
drain
pour
ugh
this
brew
isnt
bad
but
isnt
great
either
mild
hop
bitterness
a
tad
of
fruitiness
but
a
watery
mouthfeel
i
wonder
what
kind
of
water
they
have
in
cincinnati
not
what
id
expect
from
a
pale
ale
very
chewy
in
the
mouth
no
hop
flavor
whatsoever
tastes
alot
like
malt
extract
at
first
and
like
wheat
bread
but
also
tastes
almost
like
gelatin
very
strongly
very
offputting
and
sticks
in
my
mouth
im
definitely
not
enjoying
this
one
i
think
ill
stop
34
of
the
way
down
smell
is
of
yeast
with
faint
hops
not
particularly
complex
taste
is
average
at
best
i
find
that
its
a
bit
more
rounded
at
55f
rather
than
straight
out
of
the
fridge
fairly
drinkable
goes
well
with
glouster
cheddar
and
a
couple
rounds
of
darts
this
pale
ale
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
good
head
head
that
trails
off
to
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
light
and
sweet
more
caramel
and
a
bit
less
fruit
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
i
would
expect
for
a
pale
ale
but
pleasant
and
caramel
maltiness
kind
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
a
bit
of
a
sharp
finish
quite
drinkable
too
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
orange
with
a
good
1
inch
head
that
left
nice
lacing
along
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
citrus
but
mostly
caramel
the
taste
is
nothing
like
a
pale
ale
the
flavor
is
heavily
caramel
not
at
all
like
a
pale
ale
should
be
this
reminds
me
alot
of
sam
adams
boston
ale
not
whats
expected
from
a
pale
ale
but
nonetheless
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
very
sessionable
beer
clear
golden
amber
full
billowy
pale
tan
head
of
moderate
duration
which
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
as
it
drops
a
bit
of
chill
haze
musty
sour
bready
malts
on
the
nose
like
pale
malts
blended
with
sourdough
bread
starter
smell
seems
a
bit
off
but
then
again
the
last
time
i
had
this
on
a
regular
basis
is
1992
and
we
all
know
what
happened
meanwhile
dont
we
wow
this
is
much
sweeter
than
i
remember
it
and
the
sweetness
is
complete
with
a
fuller
albeit
duller
mouthfeel
what
happened
to
the
pale
light
crisp
ale
i
remember
i
know
im
getting
older
but
i
remember
a
much
different
brew
tangy
and
bittersweet
as
i
recall
but
loaded
with
the
more
of
that
buttery
butterscotch
offflavor
that
i
picked
up
in
the
stone
mil
yesterday
carobonation
is
mild
to
mediumand
body
is
again
fuller
than
i
recall
from
many
years
past
being
mediumfull
moderate
here
chewy
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
fruity
and
vegetal
with
notes
of
anise
cherry
gingergingerbread
and
marshmallow
if
this
wasnt
already
an
alcohol
delivery
vehicle
id
call
it
a
good
candidate
for
a
drain
pour
maybe
its
just
me
but
this
just
aint
cutting
it
theres
a
creamylactic
quality
here
which
makes
me
wonder
if
theres
not
some
runoff
from
the
mackesons
used
in
the
making
of
this
ill
retry
this
some
time
after
scoring
a
fresher
bottle
but
im
surprised
that
a
brew
and
my
palate
too
has
changed
so
much
in
the
past
14
years
one
thing
i
think
this
beer
has
a
superior
drinkability
in
part
that
the
abv
isnt
as
high
as
most
and
that
the
flavor
is
mild
best
thing
is
one
glass
gave
me
a
nice
mellow
buzz
at
7
for
six
pack
ill
buy
this
one
again
imo
the
english
brew
their
pale
ales
a
bit
too
weak
for
my
tastes
i
love
beers
that
are
up
in
your
face
screaming
bloody
murder
this
one
whispers
also
i
didnt
realize
until
i
looked
this
beer
up
on
this
website
that
it
is
brewed
by
the
folks
that
make
mackesons
xxx
stout
which
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
d
a
lot
of
character
and
depth
for
an
english
pale
ale
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
light
carbonated
brew
it
has
some
fruity
light
hop
scents
taste
is
nice
i
pick
up
a
lot
of
apple
in
it
almost
like
an
apple
juice
theres
some
sweet
apple
taste
to
it
not
like
a
cider
though
and
not
offensive
or
too
sweet
this
is
a
pretty
decent
ale
i
have
a
6
pack
but
id
probably
purchase
another
in
the
future
some
time

no

whitbread
pale
ale
was
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
a
while
leaving
a
little
lace
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
plenty
of
crystal
malt
the
taste
was
mostly
malty
as
well
it
was
a
little
sweet
upfront
with
a
little
more
balance
towards
the
finish
it
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
one
is
enough
notes
pretty
smooth
but
this
beer
just
doesnt
jive
right
the
mix
is
not
that
appealing
forgettable
other
than
the
appearance
easy
to
drink
light
with
some
nice
flavors
a
nice
session
brew
unpleasant
its
been
quite
a
few
years
since
i
had
this
in
the
uk
but
surely
that
was
vastly
better
than
this
swill
does
look
nice
though
i
wasnt
too
excited
about
this
beer
at
first
but
it
has
really
grown
on
me
a
inoffensive
malty
session
beer
that
i
seem
the
be
returning
to
in
between
my
big
beers
for
a
change
of
pace
a
nice
interpretation
of
an
english
pale
you
cant
beat
the
price
clear
deep
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
the
foam
was
fairly
dense
and
left
behind
a
solid
sheet
of
lace
as
it
receded
malty
brown
sugar
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
light
floral
hops
mild
bitterness
that
grows
into
the
finish
caramel
to
start
but
malt
flavour
dropped
away
quickly
lingering
grassy
hop
flavour
overall
not
that
appealing
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
buttery
texture
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
one
not
entirely
bad
but
not
very
good
and
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
english
style
overall
not
a
bad
pale
ale
worth
a
try
12
oz
bottle
poured
out
an
amber
hue
with
a
minimal
head
the
rich
amber
color
doesnt
look
like
a
typical
pale
ale
it
smelled
very
hoppy
and
of
a
sweet
fruit
flavor
upon
tasting
it
there
seemed
to
be
a
cherrylike
flavor
the
hop
flavor
was
subtle
compared
to
the
aroma
it
was
crisp
and
smooth
id
call
it
very
drinkable
the
price
grabbed
me
and
will
continue
to
lead
me
back
8
99
for
a
12
pk
in
se
wisconsin
a
great
value
drinkability
not
something
i
enjoyed
very
much
way
too
sweet
and
unbalanced
bottle
pours
a
light
cola
brown
bubbly
ale
a
frothy
foam
is
well
sustained
nice
looking
crystal
clear
body
aromas
are
deep
and
caramel
like
lots
of
malt
in
this
one
i
pick
up
a
bit
of
cherry
and
roasted
coffee
like
aromas
a
medium
bodied
brew
very
sweet
and
malty
to
me
its
almost
like
a
brown
ale
but
im
not
altogether
familiar
with
the
british
pale
ale
style
hops
make
a
minor
backup
in
the
end
nothing
citrusy
or
pinelike
in
an
american
brew
like
others
have
said
this
one
has
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
and
detracts
from
the
hops
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overpriced
at
the
local
liquor
store
but
worth
the
single
purchase
this
beer
is
the
color
of
rich
strong
ice
tea
with
a
nice
thick
and
creamy
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
it
isnt
too
pale
for
a
pale
ale
aromas
are
faint
but
of
sweet
malt
and
musty
grain
the
flavor
is
mostly
dominated
by
this
same
malted
grain
sweetness
tempered
by
some
wet
cardboard
and
bready
tastes
the
hops
definately
play
second
fiddle
here
but
are
fresh
and
fruity
tasting
if
very
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
lovely
creamy
and
midbodied
as
a
pale
ale
this
is
definately
an
oddball
in
my
book
but
very
good
and
drinkable
none
the
less
poured
into
a
standard
pint
from
a
12ozer
typical
amber
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
retained
well
intricate
lacing
in
the
pint
nose
is
malty
and
not
a
lot
else
smells
home
brewesque
bready
and
ever
so
slightly
sweet
smell
taste
is
definitely
of
malt
and
on
the
sweeter
side
where
are
the
hops
no
hop
balance
especially
for
a
pale
ale
style
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightmedium
finishes
sweet
more
like
a
nut
brown
ale
or
something
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
doesnt
impress
in
any
particular
way
its
okay
but
not
outstanding
maybe
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
anything
too
exciting
from
this
one
especially
if
you
expect
to
encounter
a
beer
with
decent
hop
character
overall
fruity
but
balanced
a
nice
english
pale
i
especially
like
the
mouthfeel
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
well
but
the
odd
sweetness
ruins
this
one
for
me
overall
its
decent
i
enjoy
it
but
i
dont
ever
seeing
myself
going
out
and
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
it
just
one
or
two
every
once
and
a
while
about
average
drinkability
couldve
been
a
contender
usually
a
beer
of
this
abv
hides
these
kind
of
faults
make
up
your
own
mind
maybe
this
kicks
ass
in
the
heartland
would
i
buy
this
again
the
ultimate
question
first
time
in
years
ive
seen
it
here
in
new
england
but
i
would
clear
copper
color
with
an
orangeybeige
foamy
head
of
meringue
that
fills
a
good
inch
of
the
glass
and
sits
back
down
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
with
lace
rising
up
the
sides
faint
aroma
of
biscuity
malt
and
sweet
fruit
flavor
is
even
and
balanced
doughey
malts
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
some
ripe
apple
grassy
hops
ride
beneath
adding
a
fine
tingle
that
complements
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
adding
a
bubbly
flourish
in
the
finish
good
session
beer
pretty
balanced
and
inoffensive
without
being
over
the
top
in
any
aspect
a
simple
beer
looks
like
a
pale
ale
smells
slightly
like
one
it
has
a
syrupy
malt
smell
to
it
the
taste
isnt
spectacular
or
exciting
a
plain
taste
with
some
sweetness
to
it
a
bit
of
carbonation
i
wouldnt
buy
this
but
its
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
drinkability
not
to
say
the
beer
didnt
taste
good
but
any
kind
of
fruity
beer
doesnt
register
as
something
i
can
drink
copious
quantities
of
d
i
hate
to
slam
a
beer
but
this
one
is
outrageously
bland
maybe
my
anger
during
tasting
has
prevented
me
from
discerning
more
subtle
flavours
but
i
still
think
its
not
worth
the
money
nor
the
expectation
of
a
longestablished
beer
like
this
definitely
the
worstever
bottled
british
beer
ive
tasted
provided
it
was
not
wronglyhandled
at
certain
points
during
the
whole
brewing
and
packaging
process
its
drinkable
but
its
not
desired
this
is
not
horrible
but
its
a
oneanddone
for
me
overall
drinkability
is
moderate
here
i
like
this
just
fine
but
dont
love
it
those
who
are
looking
for
a
completely
nonhopped
pale
ale
to
whet
the
appetite
might
do
well
to
start
here
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
great
one
either
ill
stop
at
one
neither
bad
nor
good
interesting
describes
it
best
for
me
notes
my
sample
was
brewed
and
bottled
for
whitbread
plc
by
chiswells
london
eci
england
over
all
i
find
it
to
be
a
drinkable
english
pale
ale
and
if
it
were
available
locally
id
buy
it
from
time
to
time
i
would
have
love
trying
one
of
these
from
the
50s
from
a
pub
in
sheffield
yorkshire
or
even
later
as
the
national
group
whitbread
began
brewing
near
blackburn
lancashire
but
brewed
and
bottled
under
the
strict
supervision
of
brewmasters
of
interbrew
uk
ltd
by
contract
in
cincinnati
oh
usa
ill
take
a
pass
opinion
well
here
i
sit
at
the
point
of
indecision
that
we
all
get
ourselves
into
i
dont
really
care
for
british
ales
but
i
keep
trying
them
to
make
sure
i
suppose
according
to
style
this
beer
probably
fits
the
mold
pretty
well
i
dont
care
for
the
blend
of
flavors
myself
poured
to
an
amber
color
with
a
good
head
that
lasted
very
malty
with
little
hop
odor
or
flavor
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
with
an
average
finish
drinkable
but
not
something
you
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
add
enough
hops
for
it
to
make
a
difference
and
call
me
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
aroma
slightly
hoppy
with
a
dry
toast
body
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
either
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
this
ambercolored
pale
ale
displayed
a
thick
white
head
that
sustained
itself
for
several
minutes
the
brilliant
clarity
and
lace
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
enhance
the
appearance
of
this
ale
the
aroma
is
was
fruity
and
ful
of
apple
skins
and
apricots
the
flavor
is
malty
quite
fruity
and
tart
espcially
towards
the
finish
an
ale
of
fairly
full
body
with
a
rather
smooth
mouthfeel
whitbread
comes
across
as
a
fairly
drinkable
ale
thats
just
shy
of
being
too
sweet
this
beer
would
be
much
too
sweet
for
hopheads
i
would
prefer
some
more
bittering
hops
in
this
beer
but
its
still
rather
drinkable
unfortunately
for
whitbread
if
i
want
an
americanbrewed
english
ale
i
prefer
to
brew
it
myself
drinkability
i
could
see
getting
this
again
as
a
trade
when
jwds
isnt
available
compared
with
goose
or
sn
for
the
same
price
id
prefer
this
taste
not
bad
unremarkable
but
not
bad
at
all
deep
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
head
retention
is
nice
sticks
to
the
glass
a
little
smells
malty
with
a
touch
of
butterscotch
meduim
body
with
a
little
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
much
your
standard
english
pale
ale
malty
body
a
little
butterscotch
flavor
and
a
decent
spicy
hop
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
no
flavor
was
over
the
top
just
what
i
would
look
for
in
a
english
pale
drinkability
is
just
average
as
the
brew
is
slightly
astringent
yet
not
offensive
not
bad
for
a
buck
but
there
are
much
better
brewed
in
cincy
the
color
is
reddish
amber
head
is
average
in
size
with
moderate
retention
aroma
is
a
combination
of
maltiness
fruitiness
and
some
butteriness
the
taste
is
malty
with
noticible
fruity
and
buttery
elements
tasty
enough
but
nothing
spectacular
this
is
easy
enough
to
get
down
and
nicely
priced
however
nothing
here
stands
out
to
make
this
beer
a
great
one
you
ever
touch
an
electric
fence
or
been
shocked
by
something
its
not
the
pain
of
electric
heatits
what
it
does
to
your
pulse
thats
what
this
beer
is
like
its
all
very
strange
and
uncomfortable
but
not
in
any
traditional
ways
its
a
whole
new
kind
of
badthe
first
beer
that
ive
dumped
out
in
a
long
long
time
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
just
quite
not
what
i
expected
however
its
worth
checking
out
on
the
basis
of
smell
alone
this
was
a
12
oz
bottle
left
over
from
bjcp
class
where
i
hated
this
beer
seemed
to
suffer
from
mineral
harshness
must
have
been
whatever
we
were
tasting
before
or
a
bottle
in
rough
shape
now
at
proper
cellar
temperature
this
is
pretty
decent
its
not
favorite
style
and
i
wouldnt
drive
twenty
miles
for
it
but
i
could
put
a
couple
of
these
back
without
complaint
palate
is
a
citrus
sour
with
hints
of
diacetyl
and
gypsum
in
the
background
drinkabilty
extreme
bitterness
by
itself
is
not
enough
next
about
the
only
this
beer
had
going
for
it
was
its
look
the
color
was
nice
and
dark
armberish
and
it
poured
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stuck
to
my
glass
nicely
other
than
that
the
beer
reeked
of
too
much
sweetness
no
balance
and
a
really
thick
mouthfeel
that
made
it
hard
to
finnish
the
bottle
not
recommended
at
all
this
is
a
clean
dark
amber
ale
has
a
big
creamy
beige
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
has
a
nice
sweet
malty
character
with
a
hint
of
caramel
there
is
a
sweet
molasses
character
at
the
start
of
the
taste
the
finish
has
a
light
hop
spiciness
that
gains
strength
as
the
brew
warms
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
really
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
metallic
but
has
a
floral
and
apple
smell
not
bad
has
a
bready
flavor
with
some
slight
fruitiness
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
just
ok
something
about
this
beer
doesnt
sit
right
with
me
its
not
bad
just
nothing
special
poured

nice
copper
with
a
big
light
tan
meduim

caramels
malts
honey
molasses
raisins

honey
dark
fruits
maltsnutty
molasses
has
a
slight

with

not
a
bad
beer
nice
amber
color
crystal
clear
rich
tan
head
aroma
punctuated
by
a
heavy
ester
note
blended
with
floral
hops
and
some
malt
ester
note
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
little
juicy
fruit
gum
and
perhaps
lemons
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
malt
and
hops
with
neither
dominating
some
tealike
notes
come
out
at
the
end
of
the
tasting
maybe
a
touch
of
unpleasant
astringency
the
beer
is
nice
overall
although
i
remember
when
i
thought
it
was
a
real
heavy
hitter
that
was
before
i
got
really
immersed
in
micros
though
overall
a
nice
beer
wtf
mate
there
are
definately
hops
here
but
theyre
overpowered
by
a
molassesey
sweetness
this
stuff
is
brewed
in
cincinatti
the
last
porter
i
had
was
hoppier
than
this
i
think
ill
go
drink
some
cough
syrup
now
taste
is
fruity
like
granny
smith
apples
lightly
spicy
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
metallic
which
is
a
bit
unpleasant
a
dry
hoppiness
in
the
finish
nothing
great
but
a
tasty
and
decent
session
beer
it
was
darker
than
i
was
expecting
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
something
much
paler
like
a
dark
gold
or
something
but
this
is
pretty
dark
mahogany
with
a
slightly
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
slight
mostly
a
bit
of
cherry
fruitiness
and
caramel
malt
the
cherries
and
caramel
carry
into
the
flavor
with
the
addition
of
egg
custard
spiced
with
nutmeg
12
oz
twistoff
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
light

bready

aroma
with
a
faint
yeastiness
and
further
caramel
stickysweet
maltiness
mineral
watery
background
light
bready
malt
and
not
a
lot
of
hops
to
speak
of
other
than
some
subdued
floweriness
quite
dissapointing
to
say
the
least
ive
had
this
before
and
i
seem
to
recall
at
least
a
smidgin
of
character
but
im
not
gettin
any
love
with
this
bottle
quite
synthetic
tasting
a
faint
fruitiness
is
evident
but
not
helping
any
maybe
all
contractbrewed
traditional
english
ales
brewed
in
cincinnati
are
this
way
dont
bother
very
mild
and
drinkable
brew
every
sip
brings
you
a
hit
of
that
wonderful
fruitiness
better
than
bass
i
think
great
session
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
the
original
version
from
england
i
got
a
6pack
on
sale
at
trader
joes
might
have
to
go
clear
them
out
could
use
some
more
hop
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
not
a
bad
beer
an
english
pale
to
be
sure
but
its
not
as
good
as
the
original
not
the
best
pale
ive
had
taste
is
primarily
caramel
malt
slight
hints
of
nuts
a
mild
metallic
note
and
just
a
rumor
of
floral
hops
in
the
finish
buttery
aftertaste
a
rough
alcoholic
aspect
is
present
as
well
which
makes
this
unfavorable
for
sessioning
reminds
me
of
cheap
vodka
which
is
fairly
unsettling
for
a
just
moderate
abv
stylistically
a
frankenstein
brew
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
nut
brown
ale
and
an
oktoberfest
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
pretty
dark
for
a
pale
ale
anyway
the
smell
of
hops
and
malts
filled
my
nose
with
a
hint
of
a
spicy
yeast
the
flavor
was
mild
and
pleasant
nice
finish
and
a
pleasant
suprise
for
me
i
wish
the
finish
would
have
last
longer
on
the
palate
i
would
purchase
this
beer
again
a
great
sipper
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
deep
reddishcopper
colour
with
an
absolutely
exceptional
smell
very
grainy
and
very
sweet
smelling
very
faint
sweetness
to
the
taste
but
mostly
bitter
but
pleasantly
so
there
also
seems
to
be
a
tiny
bit
of
caramel
present
in
the
smell
and
taste
as
well
a
lack
of
carbonation
makes
this
stuff
real
easy
to
drink
its
a
wee
bit
heavy
but
i
still
think
one
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
with
little
or
no
problem
a
great
brew
will
buy
again
looked
good
but
ultimately
to
light
and
acidic
to
hold
my
interest
sampled
2104
overall
a
runofthemill
pale
ale
that
while
not
bland
per
se
certainly
isnt
very
lively
a
mildmannered
innocuous
brew
that
could
make
for
a
decent
gateway
beer
to
give
to
a
macrodrinker
youre
trying
to
convert
overall
a
slightlyabove
average
britishstyle
pale
ale
none
of
the
dominant
hops
id
expect
from
an
american
ale
in
fact
less
than
id
expect
from
most
british
varities
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
can
see
ordering
at
a
bar
over
the
usual
euro
lagers
but
not
something
id
otherwise
buy
again
redtinged
brown
color
with
a
bulbous
rocky
creamywhite
head
this
is
a
very
attractive
head
the
aroma
is
something
of
a
disappointment
faint
graininess
with
a
musty
earthy
character
very
faint
hop
aroma
taste
is
grainy
with
an
underpinning
of
toasted
malt
its
moderately
sweet
with
a
creamy
soft
texture
and
a
moderately
bitter
hop
finish
low
carbonation
its
what
id
call
very
polite
pale
alemildly
hopped
easy
to
drink
quiet
and
very
restrained
a
little
more
hops
and
a
more
intense
aroma
would
greatly
help
this
brew
although
whitbread
pale
ale
is
drinkable
its
a
letdown
in
more
ways
than
one
it
doesnt
seem
like
an
english
pale
ale
at
all
more
importantly
it
isnt
very
good
beer
regardless
of
style
appearance
caramel
amber

with
a

is
very
high
good
definitely
get
through
a
night
of
this
in
the
pub
like
to
taste
this
caskconditioned
solid
not
spectacular
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
great
it
is
sweet
and
creamy
with
the
scent
of
crystal
and
pale
malts
very
malty
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
malty
and
bitter
but
really
smooth
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
quite
well
it
has
a
unique
taste
but
i
like
it
a
real
sessions
ale
dry
toast
crackling
biscuity
dries
out
to
a
light
crisp
finish
nutty
a
bit
lively
this
strikes
me
as
infinitely
more
drinkable
than
most
american
pale
ales
and
this
isnt
even
the
true
version
of
this
beer
very
well
balanced
and
supremely
easy
to
drink
the
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
edge
to
the
finish
too
unbalanced
for
great
drinkability
whitbread
pale
pours
a
deep
copper
color
perhaps
a
shade
darker
than
most
pale
ales
but
quite
attractive
with
a
wellretaining
offwhite
head
nose
is
full
of
fruity
esters
and
caramel
and
not
much
else
where
are
the
hops
taste
brings
some
of
the
anticipated
hops
but
only
in
a
subdued
fashion
the
fruity
caramel
malt
is
the
dominant
factor
here
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
for
this
mediumbodied
brew
fairly
drinkable
for
fans
of
fruit
and
sweet
malt
though
a
bit
lacking
on
crispness
and
hoppiness
to
make
this
a
truly
quaffable
ale
certainly
wellcrafted
but
not
among
my
favorites
for
the
style
a
malt
aroma
was
evident
with
only
a
faint
presence
of
hops
for
a
pale
ale
the
flavor
profile
has
a
noticable
malty
caramel
taste
but
not
cloying
and
not
overwhelmed
by
the
hop
bitterness
it
had
a
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
the
beer
finished
with
a
slight
dry
taste
but
it
was
generally
well
balanced
and
drinkable
it
might
be
better
characterized
as
a
mild
ale
than
pale
ale
poured
a
beautiful
bronze
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
lasted
for
the
drink
thick
lacing
also
developed
tha
aroma
is
average
noticing
only
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
of
malts
and
fruit
with
little
noticable
hops
some
bitterness
was
detected
late
after
swallowing
this
has
a
good
body
and
is
slightly
dry
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
but
i
wish
there
was
some
more
hoppiness
to
this
it
could
be
outstanding
head
is
big
offwhite
crusty
color
is
dark
redbrown
lacing
is
thick
the
smell
is
very
fruity
but
also
a
little
sour
with
some
veggies
lots
of
nuts
in
the
front
complement
the
sweet
malt
toffee
dark
dark
malt
in
the
middle
with
a
nutty
fresh
long
long
finish
this
beer
is
quite
malty
and
quite
nutty
it
picks
up
some
chocolate
at
temperature
but
the
sour
undertones
dont
seem
to
fade
strange
decent
beer
though
medium
brown
color
small
head
aroma
is
malty
and
fruity
a
medium
bodied
english
pale
ale
malts
are
fruity
and
way
too
sweet
caramel
toffee
and
fruit
plums
and
cherries
hops
are
mild
and
slightly
citrusy
way
too
sweet
and
overbalanced
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
dry
aftertaste
is
very
sweet
overall
a
solid
pale
ale
but
nothing
exciting
first
off
i
was
disappointed
that
they
have
been
americanized
and
have
a
screwoff
cap
the
beer
is
a
copper
color
there
is
a
small
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
went
away
almost
instantly
some
sweetmess
to
the
nose
honey
i
get
a
bit
of
caramel
to
the
taste
very
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
ok
but
i
like
my
pale
ales
a
bit
hoppier
this
looaks
and
tastes
like
a
bass
clone
it
has
an
amber
color
and
an
uninspired
slightly
bitter
taste
however
it
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
overall
its
a
mediocre
import
with
only
its
relative
rarity
to
set
it
apart
from
other
beers
of
the
same
style
drinkable
but
not
worth
seeking
out
nicely
carbonated
and
this
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
would
be
a
good
session
beer
as
it
is
not
too
anything
a
decent
beer
at
a
price
a
little
cheaper
than
bass
i
would
not
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
would
be
good
at
a
cook
out
or
such
as
i
think
many
people
might
like
it
also
similar
malty
but
the
hop
bitterness
provided
is
in
a
bad
way
imo
just
a
bitter
finish
and
not
a
good
bitter
its
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
but
then
its
my
favorite
style
and
it
falls
short
of
most
other
pale
ales
well
short
ill
drink
it
again
if
given
to
me
but
probably
wont
ever
buy
it
again
per
label
styrian
golding
hops
looked
really
nice
with
a
dark
amber
color
and
a
thick
head
that
was
quite
large
but
this
beer
fell
from
there
aroma
had
an
unpleasant
astringency
to
it
the
taste
was
of
a
bland
non
descript
sweetness
slight
hops
were
there
but
not
even
strong
enough
to
provide
any
backbone
in
the
beer
finished
with
an
astringency
where
it
seems
the
yeast
should
have
been
this
still
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
not
that
good
either
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
light
but
creamy
headthe
aroma
was
really
sweet
almost
to
sweet
with
some
cider
notes
the
taste
has
some
decent
fruitiness
but
is
lacking
a
nice
balance
for
a
pale
ale
average
at
best
beer
probably
wont
go
outta
my
way
to
buy
again
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
american
pale
ale
and
european
pale
ale
i
think
this
one
is
half
way
in
between
pale
orange
in
color
medium
sized
head
that
doesnt
linger
light
in
body
not
much
malt
or
hoppiness
in
there
unobtrusive
in
the
extreme
but
certainly
a
cut
above
the
macros
a
perfectly
acceptable
session
beer
when
you
want
to
give
you
taste
buds
the
night
off
poured
out
a
clear
amber
orange
color
the
head
was
huge
and
creamy
which
gave
off
some
strange
aromas
something
like
peanuts
and
sour
yeast
the
taste
didnt
fare
that
much
better
the
body
was
weak
and
the
hops
didnt
seem
to
ever
kick
in
a
bland
and
ordinary
beer
that
didnt
impress
me
pleasant
carbonation
and
smoothness
soft
sweet
and
slightly
bready
aftertaste
not
the
best
choice
for
a
hot
summer
drink
but
nice
for
relaxing
with
in
the
ac
or
cooler
outside

at
least

did
but
not
sure
how
appealing
it
would
be

didnt

poured
a
dark
golden
color

off
by
a

thin

head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
leaving
no

the
aroma
had
some
hops
intermixed
with
a
hint
of
skunkiness
the
taste
was
just
as
bad
as
the
aroma
it
had
some

bitterness
but
mostly
funky
sweat

there
was
a
bit
of
an

aftertaste
i
guess
that
was
there
to
try
to
cleanse
the
taste
buds
of
the
sour
taste
of
the
beer
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
ever
again

i
do
not
recommend
it
to
anyone

theres
a

i
dont
dig
the

with
a
buttery
flavor
with
alcohol
on
the
tail
very
lightly
hopped
could
stand
more
imho
has
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
sticky
too
bad
it
doesnt
taste
even
near
as
good
as
it
smells
again
i
say
mo
hops
please
the
lack
of
just
lends
it
to
taste
mighty
flat
weird
at
best
looks
great
smells
good
tastes
weird
cheers
anyways
pours
a
clear
orangish
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
very
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
light
biscuity
malt
aroma
that
is
a
bit
too
sweet
smelling
and
far
too
weak
biscuity
malt
from
beginning
to
end
with
some
very
boring
and
very
subtle
hoppiness
in
the
middle
that
fades
towards
the
finish
as
the
brew
turns
vaguely
fruity
thin
and
watery
on
the
tongue
but
fairly
drinkable
due
to
its
lack
of
character
not
something
that
i
will
be
buying
again
this
was
a
big
dissappointment
i
had
this
at
a
beer
tasting
at
my
local
store
and
really
liked
it
and
this
isnt
at
all
how
i
remember
it
nothing
earthshattering
going
on
here
very
nice
amber
color
and
medium
head
but
the
flavor
was
a
little
on
the
bland
side
there
was
very
little
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
nice
but
could
do
with
some
more
character
it
barely
has
enough
oomph
to
accompany
and
stand
up
to
a
mild
creamy
cheese
such
as
havarti
drink
by
itself
as
a
sociable
beer
not
with
food
clear
russett
in
color
with
a
reddish
cast
the
head
is
light
tan
very
creamy
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
a
pretty
solid
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
bold
with
fruitiness
some
caramelmalt
and
rich
earthymineral
hops
the
body
is
medium
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
gives
a
very
nice
creaminess
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
with
a
light
fruitiness
above
a
rich
smooth
mediumcrystal
maltiness
and
earthy
hop
flavor
theres
a
bit
of
oxidation
as
well
a
balanced
bitterness
plays
a
supporting
role
to
the
maltiness
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
but
not
really
bitter
with
a
lingering
maltiness
this
contract
brew
lacks
the
character
of
the
true
whitbread
version
especially
the
fruitiness
of
their
dualstrain
yeast
and
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
a
flabby
maltiness
thats
not
present
in
the
authentic
version
this
sample
was
brewed
in
cinncinnati
oh
it
looked
great
had
a
frothy
clingy
head
but
a
little
too
gassy
for
the
style
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
rough
overattenuated
homebrew
i
mademy
first
all
grain
mash
brew
for
a
home
brewed
ale
this
would
be
acceptable
for
a
commercal
product
it
needs
work
and
the
elite
homebrewers
would
work
on
it
if
it
was
theirs
estery
fruity
flavor
lacking
in
mouthfeel
rough
dry
finish
decently
drinkable
but
id
rather
drink
a
sam
adams
brew
ditto
on
the
price
jeeesh
sharp
bracing
taste
somwhat
biting
and
yeasty
full
flavored
but
a
little
too
complex
for
my
personal
preferance
better
on
draught
than
in
a
bottle
the
sample
i
had
was
brewed
in
cincinnati
they
are
not
doing
this
brew
any
justice
decent
at
best
not
even
close
to
the
real
stuff
very
dark
in
color
in
comparison
to
an
american
pale
ale
deep
malt
nose
with
little
detectable
hops
deep
amber
color
taste
is
fruityestery
but
lacks
any
real
hop
bitterness
tis
good
but
laks
on
the
hop
side
of
my
brain
deep
amber
sporting
a
quality
lace
raisin
bread
nose
huge
malt
start
ends
mild
hop
complete
with
a
fruity
ester
tang
a
hint
of
currant
in
the
mix
a
complex
english
pale
which
seems
to
want
to
lean
towards
an
old
ale
in
character
a
unique
beer
worth
a
try
this
ale
was
very
full
flavored
but
perhaps
too
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
the
banana
character
got
to
me
after
a
while
almost
too
rich
but
good
non
the
less
good
character
smooth
some
ciderness
on
the
nose
and
on
the
finish
which
i
dont
care
for
some
chewiness
pretty
good
pale
ale
better
than
most
ive
tried
take
away
that
ciderness
on
the
nose
and
finish
and
i
would
rate
higher
very
smooth
and
pretty
tasty
overall
true
to
form
english
pale
now
contract
brewed
in
the
us
under
supervision
of
whitbread

but
still
good

more

lively
and

pretty
normal
for
magic

im
into
it
when
the
bite
calms
from
a
heavy
start
a
good
crispness
remains
consistent
and
it
really
smooths
out
soft

makes
it

this

pours
out
a
nice

color
with
a
nice
thick
white

the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
and
malts
there
is
also
a
hit
of
sweetness
in
the
smell
of
this

the

you
pick
up
on
the
sweetness
at

the

like
how
this

goes

out

i
would
buy
this
brew
again
very
disappointing
i
feel
that
this
beer
has
potential
but
it
needs
a
lot
of
work
for
starters
its
very
watered
down
and
lacks
flavor
tastepale
malt
a
bit
flat
and
lifeless
to
be
honest
kind
of
a
bummer
ordered
this
at
the
casino
very
watery
with
no
perceptible
taste
until
a
sharp
bite
finish
not
very
interesting
but
drinkable
terrible
very
first
time
ive
completely
disliked
a
magic
hat
beer
of
any
variety
its
bland
and
light
and
honestly
id
prefer
a
budweiser
or
pbr
if
this
was
the
kind
of
taste
i
wanted
to
drink
because
honestly
those
are
better
than
this
beer
its
a
good
beer
but
over
carbonated
magic
hat
has
charmed
me
in
many
ways
and
if
they
make
a
plain
beer
well
thats
fine
i
enjoy
plain
beer
too
cheers
tasted
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
on
february
15
2015
the
taste
is
decent
with
gentle
malt
flavor
with
a
somewhat
yeast
oriented
flavor
with
a
mild
tanginess
and
bready
quality
combined
with
the
light
grain
flavor
there
is
not
much
else
going
on
i
am
surprised
it
is
5
it
is
pretty
drinkable
in
general
but
as
far
as
flavor
it
is
not
much
better
than
average
i
might
try
pairing
this
with
some
spicy
chili
or
wings
but
it
misses
the
mark
unless
you
want
a
palate
cleanser
quality
golden
ale
but
definitely
nothing
too
special
in
terms
of
taste
preferably
drank
under
40
degrees
very
drinkable
and
smooth
i
am
glad
that
magic
hat
continues
to
mix
it
up
very
mildly
flavored
almost
boring
highly
carbonatedrefreshing
and
very
sessionable
at
5
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
taken
over
by
this
butter
vegetable
oil
greasiness
that
buries
the
toasted
biscuit
and
bread
character
one
might
expect
it
ends
reasonably
clean
and
crisp
laps
pals
laps
laps
laps
laps
rjt
a
very
bland
ale
with
a
muted
skunky
taste
why
does
everything
from
magic
hat
have
a
skunkiness
to
them
are
they
trying
to
be
like
the
massproduced
beers
of
canada
its
a
brown
bottle
there
should
be
no
skunkiness
overall
the
more
i
drink
this
the
less
i
like
it
it
starts
out
very
bread
and
doesnt
hold
up
leaving
it
tasting
more
like
a
thin
adjunct
lager
in
the
finish
this
beer
reminds
me
of
our
typical
american
lager
from
the
big
3
it
isnt
horrible
but
for
those
looking
to
expand
their
palate
this
may
not
be
the
one
for
you
dont
get
me
wrong
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
i
think
i
am
past
these
types
of
beers
it
has
a
slight
fruity
tone
no
particular
after
taste
but
for
sure
it
lands
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
place
its
flavor
profile
close
to
moosehead
only
better
ogot
this
beer
as
a
gift
from
my
friend
in
a
growler
frim
a
festival
in
vermin
and
the
magic
hat
brewery
was
sure
what
to
expect
but
turned
out
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
ale
that
i
could
drink
anyday
goes
down
smoothly
but
at
the
same
time
has
great
flavor
overall
at
first
i
did
not
like
to
sweet
flavor
but
it
grew
on
me
a
lot
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
tyey
the
aroma
has
a
grain
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
kinda
dry
and
has
a
little
malt
and
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
and
overall
it
is
ok
nothing
special
overall
i
see
no
reason
to
pick
it
up
again
in
a
way
it
was
just
a
tick
and
a
way
to
get
the
pretty
decent
label
art
a
very
low
standard
for
an
english
pale
ale
a
beer
like
this
i
turn
into
a
black
and
tan
magic
hat
single
chair
35
o
a
solid
version
of
this
pedestrian
style
somewhat
less
than
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
pours
almost
clear
beach
sand
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
dies
out
after
a
couple
minutes
the
small
is
qute
malty
but
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
no
hops
to
really
speak
of
aromatically
flavor
is
a
bit
more
balanced
than
the
nose
this
is
just
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
with
nothing
to
really
set
it
apart
the
hops
only
present
themselves
in
the
finish
which
is
mildly
bitter
feel
is
fine
lighter
in
body
and
well
carbonated
i
tend
to
like
my
pale
ales
with
a
little
more
going
on
fuller
body
more
hops
etc
but
if
you
want
a
nice
cruisy
drinking
pale
ale
this
could
be
your
beer
just
noticed
i
really
had
to
dig
for
those
flavors
a
certain
grainy
macro
beer
flavor
is
present
as
well
and
takes
away
from
the
subtle
notes
that
are
difficult
to
find
anyway
not
a
huge
fan
o
goes
down
ok
somewhat
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
not
a
great
representation
of
style
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
to
bmc
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
skål
doesnt
really
impress
greatly
but
its
a
fine
ale
for
a
simple
style
overall
not
overthetop
outofthis
world
awesome
but
hey
its
a
good
beer
magic
hat
just
isnt
that
good
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
light
carbonation
a
light
body
and
a
dry
grainy
finish
thats
almost
tart
not
sure
i
really
like
this
as
it
seems
like
it
was
too
healthy
or
earthy
for
me
another
strange
magic
hat
beer
overall
while
this
is
still
far
better
fare
than
say
a
bud
the
beer
lacks
any
distinctive
characteristics
and
also
lacks
diversity
in
its
flavor
profile
a
few
more
sugars
and
fruit
esters
would
have
helped
here
or
at
least
another
handful
of
hops
overall
i
like
this
golden
beer
its
not
super
memorable
but
is
an
easy
drinker
with
enough
flavors
to
keep
you
satisfied
excellent
summer
beer
refreshing
without
sacrificing
taste
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
of
these
well
done
mh
taste
is
quite
tart
was
not
expecting
that
at
all
lemony
and
grainy
with
a
mild
floral
hoppiness
lots
of
carbonation
little
bit
of
zest
here
and
there
all
in
all
this
beer
is
unremarkable
glad
i
only
got
a
single
of
this
and
as
an
apa
as
classified
here
a
pretty
big
disappointment
picked
up
a
single
at
trader
joes
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
golden
yellow
color
small
white
head
but
it
fades
away
quickly
decent
carbonation
smell
was
grassy
and
musty
taste
was
adequate
with
enough
hops
at
the
very
end
to
give
this
beer
a
slight
kick
of
flavor
decent
amount
of
malt
lends
the
beer
a
fairly
good
base
the
beer
really
doesnt
stand
out
either
way
not
bad
nothing
great
not
worth
putting
down
money
for
a
six
pack
there
are
better
tasting
apas
out
there
a
good
pale
ale
with
nice
fruit
flavors
kind
of
reminds
me
of
9
doubt
they
meant
that
though
its
not
wowing
me
but
i
am
enjoying
it
on
this
hot
july
day
an
easy
drinking
pleasant
beer
12
oz
bottle
in
turner
me
a
is
a
cloudy
with
a
skinny
half
finger
head
s
is
extremely
light
and
bitter
t
is
biscuity
and
thin
lacking
teeth
or
any
memorable
flavor
m
is
ok
but
very
watery
feeling
o
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
decent
for
hot
summer
days
and
has
a
nice
label
missed
me
on
this
one
overall
easy
to
drink
with
a
little
bit
more
character
than
a
typical
summer
beer
and
definitely
a
step
or
two
above
a
typical
adjunct
beer
o
not
a
bad
pale
plenty
refreshing
put
a
bottle
in
my
hand
and
ill
drink
it
but
i
cant
see
myself
buying
one
not
too
bad
easy
to
drink
with
a
no
frills
attitude
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
a
bit
more
oomph
then
this
might
not
be
your
beer
o
an
alright
beer
not
necessarily
a
stand
out
id
consider
have
another
one
pours
light
golden
with
some
haze
minimal
foam
settles
out
empty
smell
getting
nothing
light
malt
taste
with
mild
hop
throughout
orange
in
there
pepper
kind
of
a
rind
taste
in
there
citrussy
bittering
if
nothing
else
magic
hat
delivers
another
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
profile
and
finish
o
this
is
a
very
nice
summer
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
refreshing
as
well
dont
expect
an
explosion
of
aroma
or
flavor
but
definitely
dont
expect
a
shitty
watereddown
apa
either
very
unimpressed
with
this
one
never
been
a
big
mh
fan
and
i
never
have
any
sort
of
expectations
for
their
beers
but
this
is
truly
a
new
low
drinkability
flavorless
beer
with
an
annoying
after
taste
would
not
try
another
one
overall
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
seems
like
it
wasnt
ready
for
bottling
or
consumption
brought
a
growler
home
from
vermont
after
visiting
the
brewery
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
good
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
almost
a
splitting
images
of
9
without
the
apricot
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
remove
the
apricot
flavor
and
you
have
single
chair
i
found
it
to
be
interesting
that
they
were
nearly
the
same
brew
in
my
opinion
i
like
9
and
i
found
single
chair
to
be
good
also
this
was
nice
to
have
back
at
home
because
its
one
of
their
brews
that
isnt
distributed
overall
enjoyable
refreshing
brew
d
this
was
more
like
a
witbier
or
blonde
ale
than
an
apa
the
bottle
claims
its
a
golden
ale
either
way
it
wasnt
very
good
not
very
clean
or
crisp
lacking
refinement
and
body
easy
to
drink
or
chug
but
not
worth
trying
otherwise
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
a
bit
rough
not
bad
not
great
but
pretty
drinkable
during
the
summer
weather
a
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
still
a
disappointment
i
remember
hearing
about
this
beer
many
years
ago
when
it
was
a
very
limited
release
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
overall
just
not
much
taste
good
for
a
hot
day
but
thats
about
it
o
this
brew
really
misses
the
mark
for
an
apa
it
really
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
mislabeled
in
my
opinion
o
decent
enough
beer
lagery
not
my
thing
wouldnt
have
again
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
pale
ales
i
have
had
that
sour
flavor
just
ruined
it
for
me
i
like
how
the
dryness
from
the
hops
the
sweet
grainy
malt
taste
and
yeast
taste
perfectly
combine
together
for
a
really
good
tasting
lighter
beer
this
is
a
fantastic
lawnmower
beer
and
has
all
the
right
qualities
of
a
session
beer
actually
one
of
the
tastiest
well
rounded
lighter
beers
ive
had
this
is
like
magic
hats
twist
on
an
american
adjunct
yet
it
has
no
adjuncts
and
has
a
better
yeast
hop
and
malt
taste
over
one
any
day
grabbed
this
out
of
a
friends
mix
pack
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
no
head
only
some
puddles
of
bubbles
the
nose
is
faintly
grassy
and
wheat
smells
close
to
an
adjunct
beer
flavor
is
crisp
and
tart
upfront
with
some
light
malt
notes
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
unpleasant
i
enjoy
this
brew
for
being
exceptionally
easydrinking
it
is
damnnear
a
standin
for
water
overall
not
really
sure
what
to
take
from
this
beer
definatly
wasnt
brewed
to
be
a
pale
ale
so
im
not
really
rating
it
as
one
more
of
a
blond
golden
ale
not
something
i
would
really
buy
again
but
an
easy
drinker
that
any
beer
drinker
could
enjoy
overall
certainly
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
and
a
great
summer
seasonal
once
again
im
confused
by
the
apa
label
but
what
do
i
know
regardless
this
is
definitely
one
of
magic
hats
better
offerings
and
certainly
worth
a
shot
o
this
is
a
big
departure
from
magic
hats
other
beers
in
every
way
i
would
definately
not
buy
this
beer
again
since
it
tastes
way
too
much
like
bud
which
i
do
not
like
under
any
circumstances
luckily
most
other
magic
hat
brewing
companys
offerings
are
very
good
this
one
just
is
not
one
of
them
o
i
would
call
this
an
average
brew
nothing
that
would
make
me
really
search
it
out
or
drink
it
again
for
less
money
i
would
just
buy
some
bud
nothing
particularly
craft
worthy
about
this
one
tastes
like
it
smells
simple
grains
but
full
flavor
and
crisp
clean
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
not
my
favorite
beer
from
magic
hat
but
it
has
a
good
clean
taste
i
am
used
to
a
more
unusal
flavors
in
a
magic
hat
and
this
has
a
very
standard
flavor
for
a
brew
from
them
it
is
a
well
rounded
brew
and
has
good
flavors
i
just
usualy
get
magic
hat
to
have
some
intersting
flavor
combinations
and
i
feel
this
beer
lets
me
down
on
that
front
pretty
good
could
do
worse
look
smell
and
feel
bares
resemblance
to
some
mass
produced
american
beers
but
the
taste
character
is
more
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
normal
for
the
style
and
highly
carbonated
its
still
nice
though
the
drinkability
is
great
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
9
minus
the
apricots
id
take
9
over
this
any
day
but
it
still
a
pretty
good
brew
o
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
macro
lager
than
a
pale
ale
i
didnt
know
what
it
was
going
into
it
and
im
shocked
about
the
classification
avoid
just
got
done
gutting
the
grass
and
twisted
a
couple
of
single
chairs
into
my
500ml
glass
the
color
is
golden
clear
with
nice
head
which
laces
well
the
lemony
aroma
is
pleasent
the
taste
favors
lemon
citrus
could
be
considered
closer
to
a
golden
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
was
a
good
drink
for
after
laboreous
effort
definitely
worth
a
try
it
is
refreshing
though
nicely
carbonated
pours
a
bright
clear
straw
decent
foam
forms
and
recedes
to
nothing
and
no
lace
aroma
of
grain
wheat
cat
pee
hop
pellets
and
alittle
citrus
in
the
flavor
biscuity
malt
herbal
tea
like
hops
and
a
more
or
less
clean
finish
alittle
lemony
alittle
tart
kind
of
an
odd
ball
beer
and
average
at
best
for
an
american
pale
ale
closer
to
an
american
blonde
in
style
i
dont
know
anything
about
mad
river
glen
which
the
label
says
single
chair
celebrates
a
ski
resort
i
presume
but
i
cant
help
but
imagine
it
deserves
better
celebration
than
this
beer
its
not
bad
really
just
one
of
those
magic
hat
beers
i
feel
very
ho
hum
about
it
happens
next
decent
tasting
though
not
terribly
complex
id
have
it
again
but
i
dont
find
it
memorable
enough
to
want
to
search
it
out
overall
id
happily
drink
this
all
summer
long
this
apa
is
typical
but
has
an
exceptional
filtering
to
it
not
so
great
for
the
beer
snobs
but
very
good
for
the
local
pub
and
colege
students
the
only
reason
i
rated
the
3
5
was
for
its
ability
to
sell
this
could
be
a
popular
beer
with
the
right
publicity
the
smell
however
is
almost
as
standard
as
a
chevy
my
first
mouthful
was
quite
pleasing
and
would
pair
well
with
sourdough
pretzels
no
joke
i
hope
that
no
one
was
offended
its
just
my
opinion
pale
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
egg
shell
white
head
forms
nicely
leaves
fine
speckled
lacing
behind
aroma
has
a
bit
herbal
hops
biscuit
malts
with
a
hint
of
rustmetallic
edge
something
earthy
similar
to
the
wacko
beet
infused
beers
aroma
flavor
wise
its
a
clean
biscuit
malt
profile
hints
of
herbalearthy
hops
with
a
fruit
malt
driven
light
golden
ale
pretty
unoffensive
at
its
core
a
beer
ive
never
tried
from
magic
hat
and
ive
been
trying
their
offerings
since
the
early
2000s
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
sturdy
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
texture
to
it
especially
for
a
straight
forward
golden
ale
overall
a
decent
easy
going
drinking
beer
that
should
be
looked
at
for
pure
simplicity
of
the
flavor
when
you
have
had
too
many
double
imperial
offerings
and
youre
ready
for
something
you
can
have
a
couple
of
then
grab
something
like
this
come
summer
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
from
magic
hat
a
slightlyhazy
gold
in
color
stark
white
head
is
decent
in
size
but
caps
to
a
film
lace
is
ok
the
aroma
is
a
bit
wheaty
up
front
nothing
strong
taste
starts
semi
sweet
with
a
touch
of
honey
finishes
earthier
with
notes
of
hay
and
basic
malt
citrus
maybe
but
not
noticeable
enough
to
me
mouthfeel
feels
crisp
at
first
but
finishes
smooth
drinkability
is
fine
but
i
didnt
want
another
only
due
to
the
hohum
flavor
i
could
see
others
liking
this
as
goto
session
brew
but
ill
probably
look
elsewhere
in
the
future
for
my
pale
ales
d
extremely
drinkable
also
a
bit
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
overall
it
is
still
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
there
was
enough
flavor
there
really
refreshing
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
the
best
beer
overall
but
its
very
poundable
and
beats
the
typical
swill
beers
this
beer
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
lingers
on
the
glass
its
taste
is
smooth
and
not
too
hoppy
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
be
excellent
to
drink
on
a
nice
summer
evening
at
a
barbecue
much
lighter
than
other
apas
it
forgoes
hop
dominance
in
favor
of
a
much
more
drinkable
beer
that
doesnt
line
up
with
this
style
magic
hat
calls
it
a
golden
ale
im
not
joking
no
really
this
tastes
like
all
of
mhs
other
light
offerings
subtle
and
drinkable
has
characteristics
of
a
typical
macro
lager
though
i
know
it
is
not
with
a
gingery
spiciness
interesting
and
certainly
an
easy
session
brew

i

lives

in
the

weird

says
it

reminded
me
of
a
lager
medium
yellow
with
a
good
head
and
excellent

is
mainly
malt
with
some
buttery
notes
flavor
is
a
light
round
malt
with
an
equally
light

finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
and
drinkability
therefore
is
quite
good
a
good
brew
to
drink
cold
quite
refreshing

copper

pretty
thin

that
laced
ok
light
aromas
of
orange
and
biscuit
the
taste
was
pretty
thin
as
well
with
some
subdued
citrus
flavors
not
much
punch
in
the
background
like
an
unhoppy
session
ipa
mouthfeel
was
fairly
light
bodied
overall
it
was
not
too
good
probably
would
only
drink
it
if
it
was
the
only
beer
available
bottle
out
of
sampler
pack
was
very
good
nice
aroma
and
good
balance
of
malthop
was
good
beer
o
not
sure
where
the
flavor
and
aroma
came
from
no
recognizable
malt
profile
only
thing
that
reminded
me
of
hops
was
the
hint
of
bitterness
really
not
bad
for
the
price
i
find
the
flavor
mirrors
the
style
of
a
true
english
pale
ale
that
is
the
malt
and
hops
are
in
harmony
the
cascades
shine
through
more
than
the
ekgs
making
this
a
truly
american
english
pale
ale
i
am
quite
pleased
with
its
simplicity
not
much
flavor
to
this
beer
what
so
ever
and
what
flavor
it
does
have
just
isnt
that
great
fairly
standard
and
average
pale
ale
mild
taste
but
drinkable
ok
in
the
mixed
pack
enjoyable
ale
in
fact
i
just
enjoyed
six
great
taste
and
quality
pours
a
light
amber
color
very
slight
head
with
little
lacing
along
the
glass
as
you
finish
the
smell
is
mostly
of
hops
and
a
surprisingly
pleasant
yet
very
subtle
nutty
aroma
the
taste
is
very
solid
hoppy
a
little
bit
of
fruit
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sligtly
malty
nice
dry
finish
recommended
pours
clear
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
mild
lacing
an
earthy
aroma
and
flavor
quite
bitter
an
excellent
brew
poured
out
a
beautiful
almost
clear
amber
a
thick
creamy
white
head
settles
down
and
retains
well
there
is
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
mild
and
has
just
hints
of
the
crystal
malt
sweetness
and
a
little
pine
hops
the
taste
is
more
malt
forward
with
befitting
its
englishstyle
and
the
hops
play
a
complimentary
role
it
grew
on
me
as
it
warmed
the
body
has
a
nice
thickness
but
just
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
good
and
with
a
little
tweaking
could
be
a
great
english
pale
ale
overall
a
simple
pale
ale
very
traditional
to
the
epa
a
solid
example
of
a
pale
ale
not
the
best
but
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
flavor
is
very
smooth
with
a
decent
balance
between
the
hops
and
sweetness
which
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
the
flavor
doesnt
last
long
however
and
lacks
a
certain
depth
found
in
higher
quality
brews
certainly
a
beer
to
keep
on
hand
for
an
anytime
beer
saranac
pale
ale
brewed
by

with
an
abv
of
5
5
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
saranac
pale
ale
is
a
filtered
brew
you
can
see
right
thought
it
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
grains
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
so
far
now
for
the
taste
it
is
smooth
at
first
with
some
bitterness
at
this
end
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
nothing
overpowering
in
it
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
but
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
a
3
25
for
saranac
pale
ale
from
matt
brewing
company
it
was
meh
probably
wont
get
this
on
its
own
i
like
this
beer
although
i
admit
theres
nothing
that
special
about
it
flavors
are
fruity
and
ever
so
slightly
grainy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
maybe
a
little
on
the
oily
side
but
not
at
all
unpleasant
easy
to
drink
with
a
slight
taste
of
sweetness
very
little
hops
and
hard
to
pick
up
any
malts
at
all
decent
easy
drinking
beer
o
very
malty
and
sweet
not
enough
hop
balance
this
is
pretty
bad
o
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewer
peppery
and
not
run
of
the
mill
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
alright
for
an
english
pale
ale
it
is
not
the
most
amazing
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
of
a
body
would
be
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
after
a
good
italian
dish
or
a
pizza
maybe
i
like
that
it
has
a
good
toasty
taste
too
it
and
maybe
a
tad
spicy
hop
taste
on
the
way
down
but
nothing
overpowering
finishes
wonderfully
and
balanced
well
although
slanted
a
bit
toward
hops
no
presumption
in
this
one
just
a
slightly
bitter
tonic
that
growls
a
bit
on
the
light
end
of
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
this
is
a
well
brewed
beer
i
like
overall
good
bar
drink
wont
get
in
the
way
of
a
good
conversation
but
tasty
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
id
pick
this
up
again
or
2
or
3
for
sure
overall
this
is
very
average
its
the
kind
of
thing
id
get
at
a
restaurant
that
otherwise
only
had
bmc
stuff
its
a
decent
pale
ale
but
its
not
distinguishable
from
the
pack
overall
pretty
weak
and
boring
the
caramel
malts
make
up
most
of
the
flavor
where
the
hops
are
not
very
fruity
just
provide
a
bitter
note
nothing
worth
drinking
since
there
are
lots
of
better
pale
ales
out
there
alot
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
a
little
light
citrus
not
too
strong
taste
is
bitter
good
spice
notes
in
the
back
end
with
a
clean
dry
finish
a
little
alcohol
burn
a
little
too
harsh
for
my
liking
on
a
pale
ale
a
little
more
burn
than
i
expected
a
tiny
bit
off
balance
but
clean
2nd
one
i
drank
out
of
the
spring
sampler
definitely
a
good
ipa
good
look
good
smell
good
taste
better
than
the
forbidden
ipa
in
my
opinion
i
enjoyed
this
from
the
first
tilt
into
my
mouth
to
the
last
swallow
good
after
taste
a
very
decent
ipa
id
recommend
it
this
beer
was
one
of
my
topthree
favorites
about
seven
years
ago
not
so
anymore
but
i
will
always
like
this
beer
o
its
honestly
mildly
successful
as
an
englishstyle
pale
ale
but
a
failure
as
a
murican
pale
ale
i
dont
even
like
most
epas
so
this
one
is
a
misfire
to
me
a
tick
is
a
tick
though
the
verdict
drinkable
everything
an
english
pale
ale
should
be
but
not
one
bit
more
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
a
six
pack
once
in
a
while
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
or
second
or
third
o
not
too
memorable
but
one
that
i
will
probably
visit
again
as
part
of
a
sampler
pack
overall
first
words
that
come
to
mind
are
safe
and
uninspiring
that
said
its
drinkable
no
real
flaws
just
very
very
basic
o
its
no
snpa
but
it
is
a
decent
pale
ale
at
a
decent
price
try
it
if
you
like
the
style
o
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
bordering
on
sessionable
but
not
overly
interesting
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
would
be
unlikely
to
want
to
finish
a
whole
six
pack
on
my
own
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
finger
of
head
that
hangs
on
for
a
bit
before
disappearing
and
leaving
hardly
a
trace
of
lace
behind
the
nose
is
mildly
malty
the
taste
is
fairly
light
with
little
distinction
from
any
other
mild
english
pale
ale
there
is
a
dryness
on
the
finish
that
provides
a
minor
tingle
on
the
tongue
that
said
nothing
exciting
here
pours
a
copper
amber
not
so
much
of
a
pale
fluffy
white
head
with
mild
lace
the
smell
is
toasted
malt
slight
caramal
piney
hop
taste
is
toasted
malt
grain
with
a
nice
pine
flower
hop
in
the
back
but
more
malt
forward
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
pretty
nice
pale
i
will
pick
up
again
overall
i
am
not
sure
why
the
hate
its
a
very
approachable
english
pale
ale
for
a
very
affordable
cost
got
my
case
for
14
bucks
overall
much
better
tasting
the
ipa
o
this
is
okay
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
among
other
pale
ales
id
drink
it
again
but
only
if
there
was
slim
pickings
o
a
really
nice
pale
ale
very
easy
drinking
not
my
thing
that
caramel
aspect
just
ruins
it
for
me
i
am
not
a
fan
of
it
in
a
pale
ale
i
tend
to
avoid
english
pale
ales
as
a
rule
o
decent
enough
basically
inoffensive
drink
it
if
it
comes
your
way
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
seek
it
out

out

very
good
food
match
heres
an
ale
that
is
quite
versatile
when
it
comes
to
food
matching
one
could
quite
easily
have
this
with
an
indian
korma
as
much
as
a
fillet
steak
or
a
light
chicken
salad
o
an
outstanding
beer
could
be
one
of
the
few
beers
i
will
session
with
so
much
better
than
i
remembered
an
outstanding
blend
of
quality
taste
and
mouthfeel
yet
still
its
so
crisp
and
refreshing
lots
of
great
taste
combined
with
refreshing
qualities
makes
for
about
a
perfect
summer
beer
overall
not
a
bad
beer
wouldnt
not
call
it
great
but
enough
to
keep
in
the
fridge
for
when
the
fellas
or
ladies
come
over
have
one
on
me
salud
i
have
never
had
this
beer
on
cask
but
im
sure
it
would
be
excellent
if
a
bar
ever
put
it
on
this
way
however
this
beer
is
available
in
almost
any
saranac
mixed
12
packs
and
with
their
wide
range
of
beers
this
still
remains
one
of
the
better
beers
they
make
great
around
a
campfire
in
the
adirondacks
or
elsewhere
this
is
an
enjoyable
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
its
just
not
exciting
theres
really
nothing
to
dislike
the
smell
is
a
faint
hint
of
the
taste
which
consists
primarily
of
floral
and
citrus
tones
perhaps
a
slight
bit
of
honey
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
only
get
it
if
it
was
in
a
sampler
box
with
others
i
wanted
to
try
taste
is
very
bitter
throughout
starting
with
stale
bread
and
caramel
malt
then
just
a
hint
of
floral
has
a
stale
bread
bitter
crisp
clean
finish
body
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
english
style
pas
are
not
my
favorite
but
i
have
had
ones
ive
liked
much
more
than
this
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
either
this
is
one
of
if
not
our
favorite
pale
ales
o
not
my
favorite
saranac
offering
but
far
from
the
worst
ill
be
getting
it
again
because
im
curious
to
see
which
foods
pair
well
from
memory
again
first
pale
back
in
the
day
even
before
i
tried
snpa
this
pours
a
golden
color
with
an
effervescent
white
fluffy
head
aroma
is
strong
pine
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
very
little
citrus
or
florals
and
mostly
goes
on
the
pine
flavor
doesnt
have
much
sweetness
mostly
pine
but
balanced
enough
that
makes
this
pretty
easy
to
drink
slightly
watered
down
mediocre
and
not
exciting
but
certainly
not
bad
last
words
it
is
what
it
is
this
pale
ale
is
what
i
compare
all
other
pale
ales
too
the
east
kent
golden
hops
makes
it
unique
hopped
enough
but
not
too
much
like
most
other
brewers
do
great
smell
and
taste
what
a
pale
ale
should
be
great
beer
to
have
with
a
nice
steak
havent
found
a
pale
ale
to
match
this
one
but
ill
keep
looking
overall
rather
light
in
body
with
a
subtle
roast
character
a
bit
light
in
sweetness
for
the
style
but
fairly
well
done
as
such
a
supportive
hop
character
is
more
evident
with
a
little
exposure
an
easy
drinking
english
pale
poured
a
quarter
inch
offwhite
head
with
a
short
lifespan
clear
amber
verging
on
sienna
color
and
almost
devoid
of
effervescence
after
the
little
head
smells
mildly
of
malt
taste
is
utterly
mainstream
and
in
fact
i
find
little
difference
between
this
ale
and
their
lager
which
i
had
immediately
before
it
thoroughly
average
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
there
are
much
better
pas
to
be
had
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
becker
light
golden
orange
crystal
clear
with
a
small
fizzy
head
with
god
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
nicely
balanced
hops
and
malt
taste
is
hopforward
very
crisp
and
clean
easydrinking
and
tasty
a
nice
pale
ale
not
too
shabby
o
i
enjoyed
this
pale
ale
better
than
the
ipa
from
the
mixed
pack
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
english
style
but
this
one
worked
i
went
to
school
in
up
state
ny
so
i
have
had
this
countless
times
both
on
tap
and
bottle
i
may
prefer
this
in
the
bottle
but
i
think
because
i
like
this
one
really
cold
i
think
the
cold
reall
masks
some
malts
and
allows
the
crispness
to
come
through
overall
an
average
brew
its
a
goto
if
nothing
else
seems
good
but
i
would
rarely
just
buy
a
6er
of
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
amberish
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
earthy
hops
and
malt
with
the
malt
being
heavier
than
the
hops
tastes
of
malt
and
slight
hop
taste
but
very
tasty
for
an
english
style
carbonation
is
great
for
this
light
bodied
beer
and
goes
down
great
overall
an
above
average
beer
o
well
its
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
if
i
wanted
this
again
id
search
it
out
only
on
tap
maybe
o
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
i
have
had
better
middle
of
the
road
ohaving
this
blind
i
would
not
have
guessed
that
this
was
a
pale
ale
too
much
malt
and
not
enough
hops
even
for
a
pale
ale
crisp
tasty
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
true
to
its
style
and
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
could
be
replaced
in
their
mix
packs
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
english
pale
ale
that
fits
right
in
with
the
style
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
have
any
characteristics
that
stand
out
for
me
i
would
have
this
beer
again
but
its
not
one
that
really
separates
itself
from
the
pack
quite
malty
definitely
more
english
than
american
this
reminded
me
of
a
hoppier
bells
amber
ale
with
much
less
soapiness
an
excellent
all
occasions
beer
that
wont
break
the
bank
definitely
something
i
would
keep
around
as
a
fridge
stocker
if
the
off
soapiness
disappeared
evident
in
smell
and
mouthfeel
and
the
flavor
popped
a
bit
more
this
would
be
a
great
beer
overall
its
a
good
session
beer
saranac
always
does
a
great
job
of
offering
quality
beers
at
a
good
price
in
fact
i
would
say
they
are
one
of
the
tops
in
taste
to
price
ratio
well
worth
a
try
this
is
an
excellent
pale
ale
but
not
quite
as
good
as
their
big
moose
overall
not
a
very
impressive
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
metallic
taste
is
a
turn
off
overall
for
an
apa
that
is
as
mass
produced
as
saranac
it
is
pretty
well
done
definitely
a
go
to
brew
when
picking
up
beer
from
a
gas
station
or
super
market
with
bad
selection
flagship
saranac
brew
pours
a
clear
copper
colow
with
a
beautiful
white
head
smells
english
in
its
malt
profile
and
quite
hoppy
smells
like
the
woods
to
me
taste
is
balanced
but
more
on
the
hoppy
end
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
its
too
heavy
for
the
style
i
always
find
this
beer
to
be
a
little
bigger
in
body
than
i
want
it
also
has
an
aftertaste
i
am
not
wild
about
a
little
mineraly
and
dry
just
a
weird
combination
that
said
however
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
in
the
summer
it
signifies
the
adirondak
mountains
to
me
and
will
almost
always
be
in
my
fridge
in
the
summers
sets
the
standard
for
american
pale
ales
poured
a
ruddy
brown
bodywith
no
head
to
speak
ofand
no
lacing
smelled
acrid
oily
an
almost
rancid
aroma
to
it
very
biting
and
sharp
acidic
grassycitrus
tasting
flavors
not
the
worst
offering
from
saranac
but
far
from
the
bestthis
may
just
be
too
hoppy
for
what
i
expected
more
like
an
ipa
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
amber
with
a
decent
yellowwhite
head
the
aroma
is
nicely
malty
lightly
oily
with
kent
goldings
and
fuggles
hops
backing
it
up
the
flavor
is
initally
yeasty
with
hop
flower
mild
bitterness
mouthfeel
has
a
thin
entry
and
is
drying
not
too
bad
a
rendition
of
a
pedestrian
bitter
that
youd
get
in
an
english
pub
nothing
really
to
recommend
it
but
a
pleasant
enough
quaff
light
slightly
watery
body
medium
carbonation
and
a
modest
finish
with
a
touch
of
lingering
bitterness
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
but
ultimately
a
little
boring
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
pale
ale
that
straddles
the
line
between
the
english
and
american
variants
of
the
style
the
problem
is
that
there
really
is
nothing
noteworthy
about
it
kindo
of
boring
o
this
beer
isnt
overwhelming
or
notable
in
any
one
area
except
its
ability
to
please
as
a
flagship
brand
ale
its
very
approachable
and
very
drinkable
i
can
see
why
its
popular
good
entry
level
craft
beer
for
those
who
should
be
broken
into
the
scene
slowly
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
keep
around
just
to
have
its
unassuming
and
unpretentious
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
my
review
would
make
it
seem
12oz
bottle
pours
a
translucent
brownish
dark
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
almost
no
lacing
aroma
is
bready
with
a
good
amount
of
sweet
malts
some
spicy
earthy

well
taste
is
bready
a
bit
fruity
with
hints
of
apple
floral
hop
finish
lots
of
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
light
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
its
decent
but
nothing
special
these
saranacs
all
seem
to
have
cleanpalate
finish
overall
a
good
bang
for
the
buck
pale
ale
that
is
easily
sessionable
but
very
forgettable
as
well
its
definitely
not
the
best
english
ale
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
would
gladly
pick
this
one
of
the
cooler
versus
your
typical
nascar
beer
it
was
a
little
heavier
singular
in
taste
and
much
less
hoppy
than
i
thought
a
pale
ale
would
be
i
would
not
recommend
it
to
a
beginner
learning
the
pale
ale
style
but
a
decent
dpearture
from
the
middle
of
the
road
i
am
going
to
use
this
one
in
horizontal
tasting
with
other
pale
ales
o
pleasant
enough
but
ultimately
forgettable
d
pretty
good
blended
pale
style
sort
of
english
type
malts
with
citrus
hops
decent
but
not
special
i
think
a
tad
less
attenuation
more
malt
character
would
help
this
one
overall
not
really
feeling
this
one
and
the
taste
is
just
a
burnt
bbq
mess
86
slightly
red
but
mostly
golden
about
a
finger
of
head
but
it
drops
down
to
just
a
thin
blanket
after
a
minute
or
two
light
caramel
nose
with
faint
amount
of
earthy
hops
slight
amounts
of
pine
flavor
is
all
the
caramel
malts
but
thin
on
body
hop
aroma
was
more
powerful
than
the
actual
hop
character
it
finished
with
more
of
a
carbonation
tingle
than
a
hop
bite
it
was
decent
all
around
but
i
would
overpass
this
compared
to
most
pale
ales
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
its
a
little
thin
and
piny
for
me
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
deep

color
with
a
slight
haze

spectrum
with
pepper
and
all

coming
through
also
a
good
healthy
dose
of

the

is
spicy

all
the
while
remaining
light
with
a
quick
crisp
slightly
dry

very
light
and
tasty
beer
great
for
warm
weather
and
just
about
any
type
of
food
a
very
pedestrian
offering
overall
but
it
does
its
job
well
as
a
nice
thirst
quencher

highly
sessionable

the
beer
is

copper
in
color
the
head
is
14
thick
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
pint

the
aroma
is
malt
forward
with
fruit
and
nut
scents
the
flavor
brings
an
earthy

taste
with
the

quite
subdued
bread

sneaks

stand
alone
or
next
to
others
of
any
calibre
drink
it
with
pizza
not
particularly
recommended
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
though
d
overall
a
pleasant
pale
ale
its
a
bit
plain
a
bit
generic
but
could
easily
hold
its
own
against
some
of
the
more
established
ales
like
bass
clean
flavors
and
well
balanced
though
skewed
to
the
hops
as
expected
but
not
a
style
i
care
much
for
and
this
doesnt
provide
much
interest
to
convince
me
saranac
is
brewed
in
nearby
utica
ny
and
a
12
pack
goes
for
about
12
at
wegmans
while
saranacs
varieties
are
inconsistent
i
am
glad
that
there
is
a
decent
affordable
micro
that
is
widely
available
in
the
area
i
hope
they
keep
making
this
one
for
years
to
come
glad
they
started
canning
this
beer
its
great
for
camping
its
a
good
staple
for
its
prices
around
here
like
all
of
saranacs
beers
its
nothing
outstanding
but
its
one
of
their
better
and
more
reliably
enjoyable
ones
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
saranac
brews
that
i
have
tried
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
fruity
floral
flavor
it
is
so
bright
and
pleasant
16

with
english
pale
and
crystal
malts
and
hopped
with
cascade
and
kent
goldings
pours
reddish
amber
clear
with
medium
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
crisp
aroma
consists
of
pine
citrus
fruit
and
flowers
with
sweet
caramel
malt
and
flavorful
yeast
that
gives
just
a
dash
of
wellintegrated
diacetyl
very
englishtasting
with
notes
of
floral
hops
breadybiscuity
malts
and
fruityearthynutty
yeast
also
hints
of
burnt
sugar
citrus
resinous
pine
sap
and
a
moderate
lingering
bitterness
the
finish
lands
a
bit
watery
and
i
was
expecting
more
caramel
malt
based
on
the
color
adjusted
with
black
malt
perhaps
and
the
body
is
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
almost
tannic
edge
to
it
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
here
its
approachable
easy
to
drink
wellhopped
and
fairly
priced
to
boot
definitely
recommended
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
there
just
isnt
enough
there
to
keep
me
interested
drinkability
purchased
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
while
on
a
trip
a
decent
enough
beer
average
for
the
style
not
available
where
i
live
however
there
are
better
more
available
beers
to
consume
this
reminded
me
of
a
fullers
esb
or
a
belhaven
in
some
ways
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
deep
golden
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
it
that
doesnt
really
stick
around
too
much
the
taste
is
like
an
english
bitter
its
not
overly
hoppy
like
most
american
pale
ales
this
has
more
of
a
malt
flavor
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
dry
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
its
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
this
pale
ale
has
a
great
dark
brown
color
and
a
very
nice
caramel
smell
the
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
bitter
with
sweet
spices
this
is
the
first
beer
from
saranac
that
i
have
had
ill
keep
my
eyes
pealed
for
more
from
them
i
was
impressed
by
their
pale
ale
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
them
not
a
bad
rendition
of
the
english
style
tastes
a
lot
like
a
toned
town
version
of
their
ipa
or
more
likely
vice
versa
which
is
a
good
thing
the
mild
use
of
cascade
hops
actually
pairs
rather
well
with
the
english
pale
malts
decent
brew
indeed
oa
solid
wellmade
example
of
an
everyday
englishstyle
pale
not
many
bells
or
whistles
just
a
nicely
layered
and
easytodrink
ale
that
i
could
see
as
a
sessionable
pub
favorite
on
draught
although
its
5
5
abv
stretches
the
bounds
a
little
d
very
drinkable
overall
decently
balanced
and
refreshing
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
flavor
just
feels
a
bit
lacking
in
a
few
areas
this
pours
into
my
perfect
pint
glass
as
a
pale
amber
with
a
light
haze
a
slightly
soapy
eggshell
head
falls
to
a
patchy
film
and
leaves
behind
a
fair
amount
of
lace
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
light
a
bit
dry
and
too
fizzy
for
my
tastes
speaking
of
taste
this
is
a
fairly
straightforward
take
on
the
style
toasted
sweetbread
malts
are
followed
by
an
herbal
black
tea
bitterness
the
bitterness
lingers
into
the
finish
along
with
a
slight
astringency
overall
its
a
nice
unassuming
and
easily
drinkable
beer
d
ok
drinkability
would
drink
it
over
a
couple
of
other
beers
maybe
the
beer
snob
in
me
but
would
certainly
give
matt
brewing
money
over
some
other
brands
on
this
one
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
a
bit
bitter
this
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
and
goes
down
quite
easy
overall
a
well
rounded
pale
ale
with
a
very
enjoyable
bitter
sweet
aftertaste

that
it

a

to
be

and
my

is
empty
in

order
an
english
pale
with
a
nod
to
the
west
coast
nothing
to
shake
the
world
but
a
good
solid
ale
that
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
saranac
pale
ale
is
a
decent
beer
like
most
saranac
products
the
flavor
is
acceptable
when
compared
to
the
price
tag
taste
is
extremely
well
balanced
there
is
a
nice
hop
bite
to
it
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
for
an
english
pale
but
right
on
spot
for
an
american
with
a
creamy
caramel
backbone
carbonation
is
just
about
right
if
a
bit
high
with
a
slightly
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
tasty
with
a
bitter
finish
dfair
this
is
drinkable
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
poured
from
a
12
oz
can

a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch

primairily
of

taste
is
good
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
a
touch
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
quality
beer
decent
ale
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
pours
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
with
faint
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
quite
malty
and
there
is
not
much
more
to
it
than
that
hops
are
barley
detectable
but
do
show
themselves
taste
is
quite
malty
as
well
a
lingering
bitterness
is
there
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
good
solid
mouthfeel
a
little
syrupy
moderate
carbonation
one
of
these
is
enough
ill
probably
be
passing
on
this
one
however
dm
smooth
on
the
palate
medium
carbonation
tingle
a
bit
too
much
depth
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
nice
overall
d
above
average
ale
i
enjoyed
it
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
type
readily
available
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
but
it
wasnt
an
unpleasant
experience
i
dont
think
i
would
want
another
after
this
one
i
would
have
one
at
another
time
but
i
know
i
would
get
bored
of
it
very
easily
d
english
pale
ales
are
a
tricky
animal
for
americans
if
you
enjoy
more
mild
p
a

then
you
might
enjoy
this
in

12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
lacy
head
aroma
is
of
pine
hops
quite
pleasant
the
body
is
light
flavor
is
dominated
by
floral
hops
quite
smooth
and
dry
not
too
much
complexity
on
the
whole
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
from
a
promising
beginning
to
a
less
than
satisfying
end
this
beer
seemed
to
only
get
worse
with
each
category
a
good
alternative
to
macros
but
i
sure
have
had
much
better
epas
than
this
id
give
a
couple
more
saranac
offerings
a
try
but
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
any
time
in
the
near
future
d
the
dry
mouthfeel
and
boring
flavor
make
this
almost
a
chore
to
drink
try
the
big
moose
pale
ale
it
is
much
better
i
first
noticed
that
this
beer
was
more
grainymeaty
than
i
expected
there
was
a
sour
muck
taste
that
lingered
in
my
mouth
a
little
too
long
the
appearance
was
average
as
was
the
drinkability
i
have
not
been
impressed
with
saranac
as
a
whole
but
im
not
pouring
it
down
the
drain
either
pretty
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
very
dry
character
not
terrible
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
well
balanced
taste
but
rather
average
d
i
think
this
is
very
drinkable
very
smooth
not
bad
rather
drinkable
drinkability
this
should
be
very
drinkable
this
just
goes
right
down
however
theres
a
bit
of
a
lingering
metallic
aftertaste
that
kind
of
kills
the
drinkability
for
me
i
can
easily
knock
this
back
all
night
long
its
cheap
price
and
wide
availability
in
my
area
makes
this
even
easier
ive
drank
plenty
of
this
beer
before
and
im
sure
to
revisist
again
this
is
also
newly
available
in
16oz
cans
dpretty
drinkable
i
could
def
have
more
of
these
d
i
think
id
describe
this
as
an
angloamerican
pale
ale
it
incorporates
elements
of
both
english
and
american
pale
ales
but
the
blend
doesnt
really
work
for
me
not
a
preferred
pale
ale
easy
going
quenches
the
thirst
okay
could
session
this
but
the
taste
isnt
that
special
wish
it
had
more
character
or
variety
to
it
its
a
very
drinkable
if
not
forgettable
epa
hops
are
perhaps
a
bit
pronounced
here
than
in
most
epas
and
the
caramel
is
toned
down
a
bit
for
that
reason
i
wouldnt
say
its
among
my
favorite
beers
of
this
style
but
its
not
bad
drink
an
above
average
beer
that
is
highly
sessionable
id
gladly
buy
this
again
this
ale
is
not
pale
its
actually
an
fairly
dark
amber
colour
it
has
a
nice
sweet
honey
smell
the
beer
has
a
malty
sweetness
with
a
eucalyptus
tang
that
fades
into
an
aftertaste
chemical
bitterness
it
is
reasonably
thick
and
carbonated
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
let
down
by
the
aftertaste
theres
better
out
there
but
this
is
a
good
offering
and
quite
drinkable
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
final
thoughts
very
solid
beer
one
i
would
recommend
and
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
no
problem
this
beer
was
part
of
a
six
pack
sampler
d
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
second
ill
be
buying
quantity
to
lay
in
for
the
fall
winter
season
d
easily
pounded
if
in
the
mood
with
the
other
pale
ales
that
i
have
learned
to
love
browns
sierra
nevada
being
a
lot
tastier
this
seems
like
the
likely
candidate
for
a
college
student
to
graduate
from
keystone
saranac
pale
ale
is
a
serviceable
if
ordinary
beer
and
that
is
likely
just
as
the
matt
brewing
company
intended
it
to
be
while
i
generally
dont
see
the
appeal
of
drinking
middling
and
mediocre
beers
every
so
often
a
standard
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
will
be
called
on
to
do
the
trick
and
for
this
occasion
thats
just
what
this
did
i
doubt
however
even
another
such
occasion
will
warrant
a
repeat
purchase
d
easy
drinker
goes
good
with
food
or
by
itself
worth
a
try
pours
a
goldenamber
colour
with
white
head
the
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
not
much
lacing
smells
of
earthy
and
floral
hops
with
some
mild
caramel
malt
taste
is
quite
sweet
from
the
malt
but
a
bit
less
hop
presence
than
i
expected
body
is
a
little
bit
thin
the
lcbo
in
ontario
just
started
carrying
this
and
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
this
is
okay
inoffensive
but
it
isnt
anything
special
and
once
my
six
pack
is
gone
i
wont
miss
it
drinkability
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
noteworthy
for
an
apa
was
dissapointed
in
the
character
in
the
hops
but
not
a
undrinkable
beer
bottle
was
part
of
the
variety
twelve
pack
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
hazy
orange
colored
body
pillowy
head
decent
carbonation
smell
was
piney
and
fresh
taste
was
pretty
good
had
some
definite
hops
in
there
but
not
overwhelming
nice
bit
of
malt
to
aid
the
mouthfeel
an
easy
to
drink
beer
as
its
taste
and
drinkability
are
both
very
satisfying
a
nice
everyday
beer
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
and
decently
carbonated
drinkability
is
fine
pretty
solid
epa
but
not
one
of
the
best
notes
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
and
i
have
enjoyed
many
saranac
pale
ales
over
the
years
because
its
so
light
bodied
you
can
really
put
these
away
if
you
like
the
taste
decent
alcohol
despite
the
watery
taste
comments
a
welldone
beer
but
something
keeps
it
from
being
truly
outstanding
overall
nice
and
interesting
ale
well
balanced
between
the
malts
and
hops
definitely
worth
a
try
while
i
would
have
liked
to
have
felt
a
little
more
malt
activity
going
on
here
overall
the
hop
profile
and
body
just
gave
a
topnotch
refreshing
drinkibility
to
this
that
cant
be
overlooked
this
was
a
nobrainer
to
put
into
cans
i
think
that
summer
in
the
adirondacks
just
got
a
little
better
poured
into
a
pint
glass
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
14
inch
head
that
quickly
disappears
into
a
small
lacey
ring
smells
of
citrus
fruit
and
spring
flowers
tastes
of
sweet
malts
with
a
nice
offset
of
bitter
hops
to
form
a
good
neutralization
a
bit
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
but
thats
a
good
thing
decent
carbonation
and
quite
refreshing
might
be
a
little
strong
to
be
considered
a
session
beer
at
5
5
abv
but
it
sure
is
nice
to
have
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
well
done
fx
matt
d
compared
to
the
ipa
this
is
correct
representaion
of
this
style
yes
sir
may
i
have
another
this
will
go
great
with
cheese
salty
snacks
and
seafood
dishes
t
pretty
hoppy
and
bitter
for
the
style
its
pretty
nice
you
still
get
the
toasty
malts
but
the
english
style
hops
are
much
stronger
than
they
normally
are
they
lend
much
bitterness
in
the
form
of
pine
grass
and
flowers
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
the
color
is
a
nice
copper
it
smells
of
hops
with
a
nice
malt
undertone
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
have
drank
a
bunch
over
the
years
of
my
life
if
there
is
one
draw
back
i
would
say
it
is
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
make
a
grand
entrance
in
your
mouth
instead
it
comes
in
quietly
and
leaves
that
way
no
real
punch
to
each
sip
but
some
times
you
need
that
in
a
beer
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavors
arent
that
interesting
so
im
not
sure
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
whoa
when
did
they
can
this
beer
has
someone
informed
woody
regardless
it
pours
a
clear
amber
copper
topped
by
a
thick
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
light
florals
and
a
tiny
bit
o
toffee
the
taste
holds
notes
of
some
weak
hoppy
bitterness
watereddown
citrus
and
a
depressed
vein
of
toffee
you
dont
get
much
more
pale
than
this
i
guess
whatever
that
means
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
decent
but
thoroughly
average
pale
ale
that
isnt
to
say
that
its
bad
its
just
not
something
i
would
really
ever
seek
out
with
any
perceptible
vim
definitely
drinkable
overall
i
wish
this
had
a
little
more
hop
taste
being
a
pale
ale
but
it
was
decent
enough
to
try
at
least
once
really
enjoyed
this
all
around
if
you
are
a
subscriber
to
the
theory
that
beer
drinkers
get
more
head
then
this
is
your
beer
my
initial
pour
created
better
than
two
fingers
of
thick
tawny
head
that
looked
like
the
result
of
an
n2
pour
i
could
have
made
designs
in
the
head
if
i
had
been
so
inclined
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
at
once
slightly
malty
sweet
but
also
grassy
and
even
with
hints
of
tobacco
a
very
earthy
beer
to
be
sure
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
but
the
commingling
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
tongue
was
extremely
pleasant
finish
tended
more
towards
sweet
than
bitter
but
that
is
part
of
the
distinction
of
an
english
pale
ale
as
sliverx
mentioned
this
was
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
rates
inclusion
in
anyones
cooler
if
you
can
find
it
overall
impression
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
but
serviceable
taste
minimal
bitterness
and
hops
rather
light
for
my
pale
ale
desires
again
tastes
macroish
below
desired
levels
of
just
about
everything
in
the
beer
little
prickly
feeling
in
the
mouthfeel
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
to
give
it
a
better
drinkability
rating
better
than
i
remember
from
way
back
when
the
last
time
i
had
a
bottle
was
at
least
10
yrs
ago
id
love
to
try
some
of
their
other
specialty
brews
after
this
one
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
am
always
unsure
of
what
others
are
looking
for
in
this
category
but
i
think
of
it
in
terms
of
would
i
drink
this
again
how
often
and
under
what
circumstances
as
i
drink
this
one
im
trapped
in
an
airport
for
another
hour
i
think
ill
try
it
again
right
now
so
that
merits
a
decent
score
i
suppose
d
drinkability
no
complaints
on
this
pale
ale
fits
right
in
there
with
the
rest
smooth
easy
drinking
and
now
that
its
in
cans
its
on
the
loose
this
will
now
be
the
staple
beer
in
my
fridge
for
the
backyard
horseshoe
pit
this
beer
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
years
it
has
never
let
me
down
d
hmm
a
little
weak
of
a
showing
from
saranac
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
a
freshness
date
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
appears
a
clear
orange
color
with
some
small
particles
stuck
in
suspension
keeping
it
from
being
totally
clear
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
slightly
stained
yellow
with
fair
retension
supported
by
rising
bubbles
of
carbonation
decent
amount
of
lace
clings
to
the
glassware
somewhat
fruity
aroma
has
other
scents
of
hoppy
citrus
and
the
malt
is
pretty
distinct
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
a
biscuitgrainy
smell
taste
has
a
mild
bitterness
upfront
with
some
citrus
hops
reminding
me
of
mildly
bitter
orange
rind
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
light
feel
with
this
pale
as
it
warms
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
that
helps
to
accent
the
hop
bitterness
the
slight
bitter
aftertaste
is
yet
again
reminescent
of
orange
peel
or
rind
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
it
would
be
a
pretty
decent
beer
as
a
substitute
for
the
typical
lawn
mower
beer
but
outside
of
that
nothing
really
exciting
amazing
this
has
held
up
so
well
travelling
to
hobart
who
knows
where
it
has
been
on
the
way
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
very
underwhelmed
by
this
pale
ale
i
suppose
it
fits
the
epa
style
ok
but
the
hops
are
very
little
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
was
no
hops
present
but
too
minimal
in
my
opinion
i
had
the
beer
a
little
a
warm
but
doubt
it
would
cause
this
effect
seems
odd
that
i
would
have
such
a
different
experience
than
most
people
seemed
to
note
more
hops
than
i
did
still
this
was
what
i
tasted
and
i
just
bought
it
from
the
store
so
shouldnt
be
any
problems
with
age
drinkability
not
too
risky
not
too
weak
middle
of
the
road
but
i
really
just
cannot
get
over
that
afterwards
maybe
i
bought
a
bad
batch
d
notes
sits
nice
wouldnt
protest
having
another
this
seems
to
be
the
staple
of
saranacs
beers
and
its
nothing
to
sneeze
at
a
great
drink
worthy
for
any
pale
ale
fan
d
great
drinkability
and
a
good
choice
ontap
dont
know
about
the
bottle
far
from
the
greatest
pale
ale
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
of
the
sampler
pack
i
purchased
i
might
drink
this
again
on
occasion
d
not
bad
but
not
much
going
on
here
an
ok
drink
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
one
weird
thing
about
this
brew
for
me
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
beer
or
something
but
despite
the
abv
i
was
getting
very
strong
tastes
and
odors
of
alcohol
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
say
i
never
met
a
beer
i
didnt
like
but
this
one
just
assaulted
me
with
a
bitter
metallic
dirty
penny
tartness
from
beginning
to
end
that
must
be
an
aquired
taste
because
i
just
didnt
get
it
i
enjoyed
most
of
the
other
beers
in
this
12
pack
assortment
but
i
can
honestly
say
i
would
drink
from
a
can
before
i
went
down
this
road
again
saranac
missed
the
boat
on
this
one
d
not
bad
the
malt
character
is
nice
if
a
bit
too
big
and
dark
for
the
style
and
the
yeast
flavor
is
mild
but
significant
enough
to
provide
some
pleasant
fruity
notes
the
hops
dont
stick
out
too
much
and
only
provide
modest
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
slightly
more
robust
hop
profile
would
make
for
a
more
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
by
balancing
out
the
heavy
malt
not
the
most
spot
on
example
of
the
style
but
drinkable
and
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
d
a
merely
ok
beer
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
beer
cheers
got
this
in
an
adirondack
trail
mix
sixer
theres
a
lot
better
pale
ales
out
there
than
this
poured
a
copper
color
body
with
some
decent
but
fast
dissipating
head
i
smell
and
taste
mostly
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
however
is
kinda
crisp
which
is
something
i
enjoy
out
of
pale
ales
overall
its
drinkable
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
i
really
like
this
beer
although
i
have
to
agree
with
many
other
reviewers
about
its
being
good
but
not
spectacular
there
is
something
missing
from
this
beer
its
like
they
stopped
a
few
feet
from
the
finish
line
so
that
you
taste
the
hops
but
its
not
quite
hoppy
enough
its
flavorful
but
fades
kind
of
fast
has
some
body
but
still
a
little
thin
on
the
tongue
you
get
the
idea
everything
thats
here
is
good
theres
just
not
enough
of
any
of
it
all
that
acknowledged
its
still
a
fine
goto
beer
thats
somewhat
local
for
me
if
you
care
about
that
stuff
at
a
fair
if
not
bargain
price
these
days
anyway
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
it
doesnt
work
for
me
and
is
yet
another
middling
beer
from
saranac
not
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
certainly
is
far
from
the
worst
d
not
a
thrilling
taste
but
not
offensive
either
and
more
drinkable
than
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
average
smooth
and
clean
not
much
of
a
carbonated
feel
is
also
notable
drinkability
is
fair
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
viable
choice
for
one
to
have
if
selection
is
lacking
but
overall
i
felt
that
this
beer
was
poorly
crafted
and
below
average
i
dont
see
myself
revisiting
this
again
drinkability
an
aboveaverage
pale
ale
this
one
really
is
quite
tasty
and
something
ill
definitely
look
for
in
the
future
clear
amber
with
a
finger
of
fine
pockmarked
foam
that
leaves
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose

lightly
toasted
biscuity
malt
and
citrusy
hops
sweet
and
bready
with
just
enough
lemon
oily
hops
to
balance
medium
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
good
beer
but
a
little
underwhelming
flavor
wise
even
for
an
english
pale
ale
this
brew
pours
a
nice
bright
orangecopper
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
with
nice
solid
lacingon
the
nose
the
aromas
are
fruity
hops
and
also
a
very
noticeable
toffeeishmalty
aroma
in
the
backgroundit
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
with
a
nice
mix
of
fruity
hops
and
carameltoffee
flavoured
malts
and
the
beer
definately
has
a
nice
crisp
finish
to
make
you
wanna
go
back
for
another
sipvery
sessionable
i
would
definitely
never
try
this
beer
again
this
is
a
really
good
goto
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
an
american
pale
ale
cheaper
than
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
2
9932
oz
growler
and
a
good
substitute
you
can
taste
and
smell
the
hops
but
they
arent
overbearing
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
someone
into
the
craft
beer
world
not
a
bad
english
pale
but
if
you
asked
me
if
i
wanted
another
id
probably
say
no
a
solid
epa
balanced
but
with
a
nod
toward
the
malt
rather
than
the
hop
drinks
very
well
and
a
steal
for
the
price

glad
to
have
had

out
d
nice

beer
from

wouldnt
mind
another
again
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
decent
and
it
is
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
few
if
i
had
no
other
choices
but
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
anytime
real
soon

listed

smells
of

earthy

maybe
a
bit
of

too
the
overall
smell
is
kind
of
weak
however
and
no
real
good
aspects
dominate
taste
is
decent
at
first
it
was
a
good
balance
of
malts
and
hops
but
then
it
turned
into
cheap
fruity
flavor
with
a
weird
hop
bitterness
after
taste
the
fruit
flavor
takes
away
from
the
beer
for
me
it
tastes
like
a
cheap
fruit
themed
beer
after
a
while
but
started
out
good
mouthfeel
i
actually
enjoy
on
this
one
not
too
heavy
for
a
pale
ale
but
a
good
creamyness
and
coating
on
the
mouth
leaves
you
with
the
hop
bitterness
good
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
presence
drinkability
is
not
the
best
here
the
fruity
flavor
will
ruin
the
beer
after
a
while
it
does
however
get
points
for
the
cheap
price
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
its
really
not
too
shabby
im
not
a
big
fan
of
saranac
but
this
stuff
puts
up
a
decent
fight
against
other
pale
ales
its
pretty
drinkable
good
with
sweet
food
i
would
guess
overall
one
of
my
favorite
from
the
saranac
lineup
in
that
it
balances
out
the
hop
oil
and
malty
sweetness
pour
is
a
standad
pale
amber
color
with
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
large
bubbles
in
the
head
more
like
soda
than
a
foamy
beer
notmuch
to
note
inthe
aroma
some
slight
light
hop
but
not
much
flavor
is
also
very
light
pale
malt
and
light
hop
flavor
i
wouldnt
say
bitterness
not
bad
but
nohing
great
either
mouthfeel
is
ligh
but
not
watery
fairly
crisp
carbonation
takes
away
a
bit
from
smoothness
overall
its
jus
not
much
to
notice
not
bad
in
any
way
but
theres
nothing
impressive
really
either
easy
to
drink
though
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
it
is
dark
amber
in
color
it
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
weak
hops
it
tastes
about
the
same
i
guess
when
burning
river
is
your
gold
standard
this
isnt
going
to
stand
up
it
is
better
than
bells
but
its
just
an
average
pale
ale
this
is
a
decent
pale
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
saranac
is
very
affordable
since
i
live
near
the
brewery
certainly
a
solid
pale
ale
to
be
when
i
first
drinking
beer
i
was
never
really
a
fan
of
pale
ales
i
view
this
beer
as
a
nice
intro
to
the
style
d
not
the
kind
of
beer
you
have
a
lot
of
but
still
good

very
drinkable

this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
pushing
it
into
a
better
drinkability
area
sure
the
flavors
are
muted
and
the
aroma
is
so
so
but
not
all
beers
need
to
blow
you
away
to
make
them
a
drinker
this
beer
average
for
the
style
and
gives
you
a
bit
of
flavor
but
its
just
an
easy
drinker
to
cool
you
off
still
works
in
the
category
and
i
cant
bitch
too
much
overall
a
decent
pale
ale
that
goes
down
easy
a
12
ounce
bottle
from
a
mixed
12
pack
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
and
appears
a
clear
amber
color
with
two
full
fingers
of
fluffy
bone
white
head
smells
and
tastes
of
caramel
malts
lightly
toasted
grains
grassy
citursy
hops
mostly
lemon
more
caramel
and
yeasty
bread
a
bit
thin
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
certainly
not
bad
for
the
price
worth
a
try
taste
light
to
medium
body
with
some
fruityness
along
with
some
biscuity
breads
finishes
dry
and
smooth
cheers
overall
a
fairly
basic
beer
done
well
granted
i
love
complex
beers
but
sometimes
you
just
want
to
have
something
simple
and
tasty
id
say
this
fits
the
bill
will
definitely
have
again
sometime
d
the
hop
flavor
with
the
smooth
bitterness
and
malt
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
pale
wonderful
beer
overall
a
good
beer
though
d
a
decent
pale
ale
adhering
to
the
english
versions
d
easily
drinkable
and
very
manageable
palette
weight
is
light
flavors
are
generally
muted
no
fatigue
it
is
a
goto
for
me
when
i
get
some
heady
singles
on
a
beer
run
and
need
something
for
the
times
in
between
i
find
this
quite
drinkable
i
used
to
just
plow
through
these
when
i
bought
the
saranac
variety
packs
i
used
to
think
it
was
bitter
but
after
having
shifted
to
neohopism
its
simply
a
pleasant
pale
ale
still
cant
figure
out
what
the
dry
woody
sense
i
am
getting
a
more
than
decent
bottling
nothing
to
shout
out
about
but
unique
enough
and
certainly
nothing
to
ever
turn
down
i
could
drink
this
for
breakfast
of
course
with
a
bacon
and
egg
sandwich
on
toasted
sourdough
clean
subtle
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
some
woody
hops
but
no
real
interesting
flavors
touch
of
biscuits
and
a
suggestion
of
malts
needs
a
little
more
umph
but
its
a
nice
nonoffensive
beer
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
but
carbonation
was
low
which
i
like
overall
a
solid
and
easy
highly
drinkable
brew
d
good
nothing
special
but
a
decent
pale
ale
this
brew
would
hold
its
own
against
imported
english
pale
ales
that
sell
for
twice
the
price
md
pretty
full
body
for
a
pale
ale
but
really
nothing
special
overall
about
this
beer
ive
had
better
ive
had
worse
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
the
brew
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
slight
white
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
floral
citrus
and
pine
but
a
bit
light
the
flavor
follows
there
is
a
nice
malt
to
hop
balance
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
drinking
even
though
i
liked
the
beer
it
has
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
it
is
labeled
an
english
pale
ale
but
it
taste
more
like
and
apa
it
kinda
gets
caught
inbetween
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
to
avoid
but
its
definitely
not
one
to
seek
out
soapy
bubbly
head
which
is
indicative
of
saranac
beers
cloudy
golden
beer
with
suspending
sediment
smells
of
english
malt
hops
is
the
first
thing
you
taste
tastes
like
an
average
english
tavern
beer
with
a
load
of
hops
differs
from
the
india
pale
ales
and
can
tell
it
is
from
english
roots
this
was
a
decent
saranac
brew
and
one
that
i
was
duly
impressed
with
it
had
a
great
english
feel
to
it
but
a
bit
bolder
excellent
drinkability
would
maybe
appreciate
a
more
robustcomplex
flavor
nonetheless
an
excellent
brew
id
recommend
this
to
many
and
ill
be
sure
to
have
another
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
pretty
subdued
been
lean
towards
sweet
malts
smell
is
reminiscent
of
ripe
peaches
taste
is
simple
lightly
toasty
malts
backed
by
citrusy
hops
that
i
wish
were
more
pronounced
this
is
not
a
bad
pale
ale
by
any
means
but
it
lacks
character
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
just
need
something
i
know
the
english
pale
ale
shouldnt
have
as
much
hops
flavor
as
the
american
or
ipa
but
i
would
like
more
flavor
than
what
is
here
kind
of
watered
down
flavor
longneck
from
the

with

dimension
and
finish
mediumlight
in
the
mouth
with
a
smooth
carbonation
and
dry
finish
drinkability
is
great
with
this
ale
it
is
very
nicely
balanced
delicious
fresh
on
draft
and
a
very
dependable
pale
ale
in
general
smells
of
earthy
yeast
pine
citrus
poured
golden
amber
dark
orange
with
an
off
white
head
and
decent
lacing
a
bitterness
on
the
aggressive
side
for
a
pale
ale
approaching
ipa
territory
good
body
dry
and
fairly
sweet
as
well
smooth
lingering
and
nothing
overpowering
on
the
palate
easily
drinkable
and
affordable
will
likely
buy
again
well
worth
the
3
to
sample
a
growler
d
i
must
say
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
bitter
ale
and
it
is
actually
quite
mellow
rather
enjoyable
cheers
the
pale
ale
pours
a
copper
color
with
little
head
or
retention
but
does
have
a
decent
trace
of
lacing
with
the
little
ring
a
fruity
hop
aroma
good
solid
balanced
flavor
a
little
bitter
after
taste
and
fruit
scent
does
appear
in
the
taste
this
is
a
smooth
pale
ale
and
probably
a
good
starting
point
for
those
unsure
about
the
hop
bite
saranac
seems
to
back
off
the
hops
a
bit
on
this
one
probably
because
they
also
have
an
india
pale
ale
next
review
lightmedium
body
makes
this
a
drinkable
session
beer
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
delicious
pale
ale
that
features
more
west
coast
ale
characteristics
to
be
considered
a
english
pale
simply
pale
ale
that
doesnt
have
the
character
or
charm
to
really

poured
several
but
solid
the

was
almost

of

saranacs
famous
burnt
malts
when
its
slightly

at

i
was

that
the
taste
would
be
predominantly
piney
there
was
some
honey
underlying
the

it
tasted
similar
to

with

with

for

of

if
a

more
malty
than
the

very
nice
pale
ale
wish
we
had
these
saranac
brews
in
metro
detroit
i
dont
like
to
slam
beers
and
it
isnt
in
my
nature
to
just
dismiss
a
line
of
beers
but
this
is
just
bad
unless
you
are
picking
up
the
black
and
tan
please
stay
away
from
this
line
of
beers
d
after
being
disapointed
with
a
few
other
saranac
brews
that
ive
had
previously
im
actually
slightly
impressed
with
this
one
with
that
said
however
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
good
pale
ale
by
itself
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
but
it
would
perhaps
make
a
good
barbeque
or
picnic

is
mostly
mildly
citric
hops

teaamber
in

with
a
frothy

a
bit
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malts
in
the
fore
then
lightly
hopped
very
low
key
flavors
but
quite
refreshing
and
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
food
as
it
is
fairly
wet
and
not
at
all
dry
cheers
pours
copper
tan
head
quickly
goes
into

with
a

has
a
rather
sharp
edge
to
the
finish
not
badbut
i
think
sierra
nevada
has
it
beat
the
alcohol
is
hardly
felt
here
and
along
with
the
black
forest
this
is
the
only
beer
in
the
pack
that
id
buy
and
try
again
on
its
own
enjoyable
only
to
a
certain
extent
but
this
been
has
a
lot
of
unrealized
potential
worth
a
try
if
youre
seriously
into
this
style
like
i
am
i
am
sold
this
is
a
tasty
pale
ale
and
it
is
damn
drinkable
i
need
to
find
sixpacks
of
this
it
is
a
session
beer
i
could
quaff
this
with
ease
at
a
bbq
or
picnic
or
a
poker
game
this
is
my
favorite
saranac
beer
i
think
this
beer
was
part
of
a
12beer
sampler
that
i
purchased
in
lawrence
ks
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
stingy
couldnt
finish
this
one
very
pale
amber
heck
what
beer
isnt
yeah
yeah
dont
answer
that
question
tight
white
head
of
medium
height
with
short
lasting
power
smells
ok
i
guess
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
ok
astringent
bitterness
pervades
bleh
i
mean
sure
you
get
some
of
the
malt
flavors
and
all
but
whoa
completely
overwhelmed
by
just
a
bad
flavor
bleh
and
bleh
again
way
too
fizzy
in
the
mouth
wa
and
acrid
to
make
me
want
to
drink
any
more
of
it
d
this
is
the
second
worse
beer
from
the
winter
variety
pack
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
prove
revolting
this
is
a
good
pale
ale
amber
dark
copper
color
smell
of
hops
not
too
strong
though
taste
is
hoppy
but
not
overboard
on
it
the
most
impressive
feature
of
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
you
could
drink
it
all
night
it
feels
ok
in
your
stomach
good
flavor
too
this
is
my
second
favorite
of
the
saranac
beers
plan
to
have
anothe
one
of
these
in
the
future
drinkability
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
about
half
of
it
went
down
the
sink
no
amount
of
temperature
change
would
help
this
one
drinkability
eh
so
much
other
good
stuff
out
there
move
along
move
along
all
in
all
a
respectable
pale
that
is
better
than
many
of
saranacs
offerings
taste
isnt
as
great
but
nowhere
near
offensive
lots
of
breadyness
and
malts
going
on
again
more
hops
than
expected
a
nice
change
i
guess
some
floraltype
things
too
definitely
deeper
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
soapy
oily
not
unpleasant
very
drinkable
on
the
whole
id
say
tasty
simple
goes
down
easy
a
good
apa
if
ever
there
was
one
an
easy
choice
not
a
terribly
complex
pale
ale
but
still
interesting
and
very
drinkable
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
disappears
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
fruity
and
piney
but
not
as
bold
as
i
would
like
taste
is
well
balanced
fruity
to
earthy
and
piney
feels
very
crisp
and
fresh
in
the
mouth
overall
a
good
drinkable
session
beer
a
buddy
raved
about
this
beer
and
i
admit
my
expectations
were
low
but
it
has
far
exceded
them
i
recommend
you
go
get
a
sixer
and
drink
it
tonight
the
beer
poured
out
a
nice
reddish
hue
it
had
a
pretty
decent
head
that
has
lingered
around
the
taste
is
great
too
you
can
taste
the
hops
without
being
overrun
by
them
a
nice
well
balanced
pale
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionlly
smooth
not
a
bit
of
harshness
there
is
a
bit
of
lingering
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
the
drinkability
on
this
one
is
almost
second
to
none
i
could
drink
these
long
after
the
sun
goes
down
this
was
the
final
beer
in
my
saranac
sampler
you
can
bet
i
will
look
for
more
by
this
brewer
every
beer
i
tried
by
them
was
exceptional
watery
flavor
nice
hops
up
front
very
dry
and
slightly
sweet
giving
way
in
the
middle
to
watery
emptiness
and
a
bland
macro
lager
taste
and
ending
dry
and
flat
not
good
this
is
almost
not
a
pale
ale
but
the
fact
that
its
so
radical
makes
it
well
worth
a
try
pulled
from
the
12
beers
of
winter
mix
pack
this
beer
provided
a
very
pleasant
surprise
its
one
of
the
tastiest
apas
ive
tried
in
a
while
its
color
is
a
fairly
dark
golden
copper
and
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
forms
as
it
fades
a
nice
lacing
is
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
the
weak
point
there
is
a
malty
sweetness
and
if
you
swirl
it
a
nice
hoppiness
comes
out
the
taste
is
delivered
on
the
broad
shoulders
of
a
very
nice
malt
base
slightly
sweet
with
a
background
fruitiness
a
nice
grassiness
and
florally
hop
element
comes
quickly
and
stays
the
whole
time
it
finishes
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
superb
as
a
pale
ale
should
be
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
regional
pale
ale
flavor
is
a
crisp
hop
body
with
hints
of
fruit
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
peeks
through
here
and
there
clear
bronze
color
decent
offwhite
head
but
lacing
is
smeary
and
spotty
at
best
smell
taste
are
dominantly
diacetyl
toffeebuttery
flavors
if
you
like
caramel
and
pale
malts
this
might
just
be
your
new
favorite
pale
ale
otherwise
its
skippable
decent
hop
profile
for
a
pa
but
still
nothing
too
impressive
started
out
really
hoppy
but
the
more
the
beer
warmed
the
less
bitter
it
was
appearance
was
the
best
characteristic
of
this
one
super
fluffy
head
that
lasted
a
short
while
but
then
died
to
a
thick
laceing
smell
was
fruity
up
front
with
strong
hops
and
slight
malt
overall
an
ok
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
drinkability
is
pretty
high
its
a
little
light
going
but
i
could
definitely
session
this
and
enjoy
it
probably
wont
though
plenty
of
other
pale
ales
out
there
to
sample
and
enjoy
this
is
nothing
amazing
but
a
fine
brew
indeed
d
good
nice
session
beer
or
good
for
friends
who
cant
handledont
like
more
flavorful
craft
brews
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
up
to
the
standards
of
discriminating
bas
in
my
opinion
in
other
words
theres
better
beer
for
your
money
oily
hop
is
the
only
savior
of
this
brew
other
than
that
there
is
nothing
much
to
it
not
something
id
never
drink
just
not
a
choice
pale
ale
for
me
not
too
shabby
when
shaken
hop
notes
much
more
evident
in
the
nose
needs
a
more
sizable
and
durable
head
but
i
cant
elicit
one
on
the
whole
its
a
simple
brew
with
some
significant
but
not
overwhelming
pitfalls
the
hops
and
foam
need
more
umph
the
mouthfeel
needs
tinkering
side
notei
just
burped
and
the
burptaste
is
phenomenally
good
lots
of
intricate
hop
flavor
and
my
opinion
calls
for
less
smoothness
in
the
quest
for
more
robust
body
more
carbonation
certainly
this
is
a
nice
coppery
color
with
a
two
finger
head
pretty
nice
looking
considering
their
other
beers
have
smallish
heads
the
smell
is
a
little
lightsome
hops
and
a
little
floralbut
not
much
the
taste
isnt
as
hoppy
as
other
pale
ales
its
a
little
weaksome
hops
and
spicesbut
a
little
watery
the
mf
is
too
watery
and
light
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
all
daybut
its
just
too
weak
and
watery
for
my
taste
i
could
drink
pkenty
of
these
its
a
nice
dark
color
and
infact
it
is
pretty
bitter
compared
to
other
pale
ales
ive
had
i
also
tried
it
fromt
he
sample
pack
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
the
balc
and
tan
the
best
out
of
this
brewery
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
the
aftertaste
is
plesant
but
stays
for
a
while
after
sips
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
not
a
work
of
art
but
still
a
tasty
flexible
beer
great
for
sessions
ballgames
or
whatever
drinkability
decent
and
drinkable
but
not
entirely
memorable
very
representative
of
its
style
overall
good
beer
good
friends
good
times
enjoy
nothing
exciting
except
that
this
is
really
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
fresh
on
tap
at
the
bar
when
youre
thirsty
boy
its
just
good
this
is
good
the
sort
of
beer
i
could
have
a
half
dozen
of
during
a
party
and
not
think
about
a
good
workhorse
beer
and
drinking
it
today
reminds
me
i
dont
drink
it
often
enough

even
for
an

with

fruit
esters
and

in

the

54this
isnt
bad
its
a
little
light
on
the
malts
for
a
classic
english
ale
i
think
though
the
malts
do
come
out
more
at
temperature
nice
this
ale
has
a
beautiful
reddish
golden
color
and
a
wonderfully
foamy
head
the
head
recedes
slowly
into
a
single
layer
leaving
a
very
thick
lace
around
the
glass
i
was
hit
with
the
aroma
of
hops
on
first
smell
along
with
a
crisp
citrus
rind
smell
and
a
touch
of
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
carbonated
and
quite
pleasant
to
have
in
ones
mouth
the
flavor
is
at
first
a
smooth
malt
but
it
quickly
builds
to
a
mild
bitter
marked
by
hops
and
the
citrus
rind
lingers
through
there
is
also
a
very
slight
hint
of
burnt
earthiness
the
sip
leaves
a
interestingly
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
as
i
usually
like
left
a
desire
to
drink
more
quite
a
good
ale
slightly
above
average
mouthfeel
enjoyable
and
smooth
very
mild
hop
bite
finish
despite
its
relatively
full
hop
flavor
much
less
bite
than
say
sierra
nevada
p
a
this
is
a
perfect
lawn
mowing
session
beer
which
could
be
consumed
over
many
hours
in
the
summer
months
excellent
poured
a
somewhat
hazy
copper
color
with
light
to

aroma

with

was

and
a
nice
zesty
hop
finish
i
think
a
well
made
palevery
nicely
balanced
drinkability
is
good
no
doubt
but
i
need
a
little
more
pizzazz
in
my
ales
to
make
them
worth
my
while
the
beer
pours
a
dark

color

sweetness

6
specialty
malts
make
up
its
grist
giving
it
malt
character
that
is
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
low
to
med
and
very
drinkable
its
not
the
best
pale
ale
ive
had
but
its
not
the
worst
either

second
look
light
copper
color
with
a
beige
frothy
head
light
aroma
of
malt
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
smooth
even
and
crisp
but
i
find
the
flavor
severely
lacking
this
is
more
pale
than
ale
its
a
bit
flowery
and
a
bit
citrusy
but
the
malt
doesnt
come
through
very
stong
and
there
is
no
detectable
hops
in
the
upfront
the
finish
or
the
aftertaste
this
beer
looked
good
and
smelled
good
but
the
taste
just
didnt
measure
up
good
value
for
the
price
but
not
enough
to
recommend
it
so
far
im
finding
saranacs
to
look
better
than
they
taste
this
pale
poured
a
nice
lusty
amber
with
a
full
light
tan
head
lots
of
hops
in
the
initial
smell
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
otherwise
the
taste
though
was
a
little
more
intricate
it
was
tart
and
had
light
citrus
tweaksnothing
overwhelming
but
it
also
faded
quickly
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
enough
not
a
great
one
but
good
for
a
warm
spring
afternoon
i
got
this
pretty
cheap
at
my

a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
the
nose
is
perfumey
but
without
any
distinct
hops
with
some
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
sweet
tobbacco
the
body
is
medium
and
a
very
finemoderate
carbonation
leaves
it
just
slightly
crisp
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
displays
a
solid
caramellaced
malt
thats
well
infused
with
floral
and
gently
spicy
hops
the
signature
matts
yeast
plays
a
big
role
here
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
but
also
somewhat
soapy
firm
bitterness
decent
balance
nicely
rounded
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
offering
especially
considering
its
full
maltiness
although
the
hops
may
let
you
down
a
solid
worthy
pale
ale
hazy
copperishgold
with
as
good
a
head
on
a
beer
as
ive
ever
seen
lots
of
lace
a
dry
malty
beer
that
is
just
a
tad
more
aggressively
hopped
than
most
british
beers
but
otherwise
is
a
dead
ringer
some
butter
flavors
bread
crust
lots
of
caramel
trademark
saranac
flavor
if
you
ask
me
with
some
spiciness
derived
from
the
yeast
a
dry
finish
with
some
puckering
on
the
tongue
is
chief
evidence
of
hops
a
bit
of
citric
flavor
in
taste
and
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
this
is
a
solid
underappreciated
beer
and
if
youre
stuck
on
what
to
buy
for
yourself
or
your
friends
this
will
not
disappoint
the
taste
was
bittersweet
and
slightly
cidery
the
beer
was
light
to
medium
bodied
not
too
much
here
that
stands
out
but
a
good
drinkable
beer
regardless
clear
copper
body
with
under
a
huge
breathing
rocky
head
of
bubbles
of
all
sizes
which
rise
above
the
glass
very
sticky
aroma
is
citrus
and
pine
akin
to
a
lowkey
version
of
sierra
nevada
its
good
but
not
too
strong
taste
starts
with
some
caramel
then
the
citricy
hops
sneak
in
but
neither
overwhelms
you
could
say
it
needs
more
malt
or
more
hops
but
as
it
is
it
is
finely
balanced
this
is
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
walking
the
line
between
american
and
english
relativily
inexpensive
also
f
another
beer
from
the
12
beers
of
christmas
12
pack
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
small
head
and
doesnt
last
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
matt
lineup
that
i
have
had
this
one
is
okay
nice
malty
smell
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
similar
only
more
hops
coming
through
in
the
end
smooth
but
not
very
complex
aftertaste
has
hints
of
citrus
from
the
hops
i
am
happily
suprised
i
would
try
this
one
again
this
one
deserves
about
a
sentence
for
each
category
because
its
trying
to
be
a
good
beer
but
it
ends
up
getting
lost
in
mediocrity
the
amber
copper
tone
it
pours
with
a
decent
off
white
head
leaving
haphazard
tracks
off
lace
down
the
glass
nothing
uniform
in
the
appearance
the
bottle
says
a
bouquet
of
hop
aroma
but
i
am
going
to
guess
and
say
my
flowers
have
wilted
no
but
seriously
the
hop
aroma
is
there
and
semipleasan
only
it
is
so
faint
the
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
but
the
bitterness
is
not
really
that
bitter
for
a
pale
ale
this
beer
is
also
lacking
any
kind
of
a
balance
in
the
wannabe
hop
flavor
nothing
is
here
to
offset
it
i
better
quit
drinking
saranac
losing
respect
fast
i
like
the
way
it
feels
like
it
expands
to
feel
fluffy
in
the
mouth
and
the
hops
spread
across
the
tongue
reaching
the
back
of
it
as
i
swallow
allowing
the
optimal
bitterness
to
reach
my
palate
th
overall
drinkability
is
so
so
but
nothing
here
is
realing
me
in
i
am
just
not
sold
on
this
one
and
thats
about
it
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
genre
of
pale
ale
and
this
is
a
more
than
decent
effort
its
pour
was
very
nice
witha
rich
deep
amber
color
and
a
substantial
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
deep
and
rich
with
heavy
notes
of
coffee
smoked
wood
malts
and
some
quality
hops
the
taste
was
rich
and
creamy
with
toasted
malts
and
burnt
flavors
and
just
a
little
fresh
goldings
hops
taste
this
taste
coupled
with
the
fact
that
a
12
pack
costs
under
10
dollars
makes
the
saranac
pale
a
great
choice
i
would
also
recomend
that
the
saranac
pale
and
the
sierra
nevada
be
one
that
you
slowly
ween
your
more
ignorant
friends
away
from
the
macro
swill
before
they
get
the
full
blown
beer
revolution
from
some
of
the
victories
and
rogues
i
dont
consider
myself
a
pale
ale
lover
but
since
it
came
in
a
sampler
pack
i
felt
obliged
to
try
it
once
poured
the
color
was
clear
reddish
amber
a
thick
foamy
head
was
present
but
dissipated
pretty
quickly
once
a
couple
of
drinks
were
taken
during
consumption
head
residue
remained
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
adding
to
taste
of
each
drink
the
taste
was
fairly
balanced
no
overpowering
bitter
or
sweet
taste
and
went
down
very
well
i
didnt
experience
any
overpowering
aftertaste
and
i
found
myself
looking
forward
to
the
next
drink
two
other
individuals
enjoyed
one
with
me
and
they
agree
that
they
enjoy
another
even
at
their
expense
goes
down
very
easy
nothing
special
or
outstanding
but
still
a
good
beer
i
will
drink
it
again
pours
a
dark
ambergold
hue
with
the
biggest
head
i
have
seen
on
any
of
the
saranac
beers
i
have
sampled
nice
hop
aroma
and
taste
enough
maltiness
to
hold
it
toghether
and
enough
hopiness
to
finish
it
up
a
good
gateway
for
the
style
7
of
the
12
beer
sampler
is
a
keeper
not
a
legendary
ipa
but
not
a
bad
one
either
1
more
reason
to
buy
the
sampler
copper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
leaves
a
good
deal
of
lacework
down
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
hoppiness
with
a
slight
malt
background
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
and
also
the
fruity
citric
hop
flavors
the
bitterness
is
at
a
medium
level
in
the
finish
it
is
overall
a
relatively
smooth
drinking
pale
ale
nothing
really
sticks
out
in
this
one
it
is
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
but
seems
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
than
an
english
pale
ale
i
tend
to
think
of
this
as
a
poor
mans
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
from
a
brewery
that
deserves
credit
for
putting
out
some
fine
beers
if
not
on
the
same
level
as
people
like
sierra
victory
anchor
etc
this
englishstyle
pale
ale
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
rather
surprising
small
particles
of
brown
sediment
it
had
a
small
head
with
good
retention
and
little
if
any
lacing
there
was
a
nice
floral
scent
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
aroma
also
the
hops
really
assert
themsleves
in
the
taste
and
the
malt
makes
a
late
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
a
pretty
good
taste
overall
im
usually
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
but
for
this
review
the
hops
were
perhaps
just
a
little
too
assertive
for
me
the
medium
body
and
smooth
tingle
gave
this
beer
a
rather
pleasant
mouthfeel
this
pale
ale
remains
very
drinkable
while
i
would
perhaps
reach
for
another
english
pa
or
another
style
of
beer
if
given
the
choice
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
with
a
saranac
pale
ale
at
any
given
time
pretty
good
pale
ale
would
go
back
for
another
this
beer
has
an
orangecopper
color
with
an
offwhite
foamy
head
which
dissipates
a
bit
too
quickly
the
nose
is
hoppy
but
not
especially
distinctive
an
initial
mildly
bitter
taste
leads
to
tangy
notes
of
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
with
a
dry
bitterness
remaining
at
the
finish
although
quite
clean
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
this
is
not
perhaps
the
best
example
of
its
style
but
saranac
is
still
to
be
commended
for
this
inexpensive
pleasant
and
reliable
brew
this
pale
ale
is
a
pale
copper
color
it
pours
with
a
decent
head
that
never
fully
subsided
and
left
a
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
floral
hops
but
is
has
a
stale
note
to
the
scent
a
hint
of
malt
is
also
present
the
taste
has
nice
bitterness
on
a
malt
background
but
the
hops
dominate
the
flavor
the
finish
is
a
little
fruity
with
a
hint
of
pears
followed
by
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
hops
are
not
assertive
in
this
brew
but
they
are
present
in
every
aspect
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
adequate
but
not
a
full
as
a
true
english
pale
the
carbonation
is
not
as
heavy
as
many
of
the
saranac
brews
either
which
is
a
good
thing
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
better
selling
saranac
beers
in
my
area
but
there
are
several
others
that
are
better
but
as
far
as
bang
for
the
buck
this
one
may
be
hard
to
beat
rocky
slightly
offwhite
head
that
melts
into
thick
lace
on
top
of
this
deep
amber
brew
it
smelled
slightly
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
hoppy
fruit
and
an
earthy
mustiness
luckily
the
folks
at
matts
decided
to
make
this
an
english
style
pa
so
it
was
a
nice
break
from
cascade
overloaded
apas
tastes
of
sweet
bready
malt
and
a
nice
dirty
for
the
lack
of
a
better
word
hoppiness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
this
was
a
better
beer
than
i
remember
this
pours
a
white
healthy
head
over
clear
deep
gold
with
decent
carbonation
nose
is
fresh
hops
cascades
i
believe
my
nose
tells
me
with
some
nice
malty
tones
under
the
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
a
little
lightbodied
but
with
very
adequate
hop
bitterness
followed
by
light
sweet
maltiness
finishes
a
bit
dry
a
very
well
made
pale
ale
quite
drinkable
a
pleasent
surprise
it
was
not
what
i
had
anticipated
a
slight
lingering
after
taste
of
hops
plus
something
more
well
balanced
and
full
bodied
with
a
pleasing
aroma
my
compliments
to
the
brewers
golden
color
with
a
hoppy
taste
slight
head
that
streams
down
the
glass
as
you
drink
not
overwhelming
there
are
a
lot
of
good
local
ales
but
i
had
to
try
this
it
is
light
enough
to
enjoy
in
the
heat
clear
copper
brown
with
a
smallish
head
of
off
white
foam
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
flowery
hop
aroma
and
a
nice
malty
sweet
flavor
balanced
with
a
citrusy
hop
bitterness
tasty
and
very
drinkable

more
of
a

apa
smell
and

the
taste
is
pretty
hopped
up
for
an
english
pale
ale
there
is
some

there
but
a
pretty
bitter
finish
a
decent
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
i
think
they
are
run
of
the
mill
in
many
regards
and
this
hasnt
changed
my
opinion
slightly
above
averagetoaverage
great
color
and
nice
head
which
left
lace
all
down
the

terrific

was
crisp
and
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
but
went
down
easy
finishes
dry
with
some

on
the
tounge
one
of
those
beers
that
belongs
in
everyones
refrigerator
at
all
times
one
of
saranacs
best
i
suppose
the
malts
ground
this
brew
as
english
but
the
hops
are
strong
and
biting
nice
solid
earthy
pale
ale
drinks
good
and
flavourful
cheers
while
more
senior
reviewers
have
claimed
this
is
not
a
true
english
pale
ale
as
the
label
states
i
find
no
fault
with
it
in
regard
to
drinkability
but
then
im
becoming
partial
to
ale
and
decentlyhopped
ones
at
that
this
beer
poured
an
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
white
head
that
left
a
little
lace
an
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
a
flavor
of
hops
malt
and
slight
bit
of
chocolate
not
a
bad
pale
ale
but
i
will
probably
stick
with
buying
columbus
brewings
slightly
below
average
the
one
i
had
was
not
overly
bitter
and
had
a
decent
head
and
aroma
soso
color
and
rather
bland
flavor
made
this
pale
ale
somewhat
unremarkable
overall
dry
and
hoppy
a
bit
mild
in
body
but
you
can
certainly
taste
the
hops
a
bit
darker
in
appearance
than
some
other
pales
it
has
a
sexy
sexy
look
to
it
golden
not
a
sierra
nevada
but
much
better
than
bass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
slight
head
that
retains
nicely
good
lacing
effect
also
pretty
nice
flowery
hop
boquet
on
the
nose
some
pungency
shines
through
also
the
taste
is
not
as
impressive
as
the
nose
however
nothing
really
stands
out
some
caramel
malt
slight
bitterness
nothing
really
grabs
my
attention
pretty
average
pa
decent
enough
pale
ale
but
does
not
present
the
excitement
and
flavor
of
a
true
english
pale
ale
it
is
however
better
than
most
us
domestic
brewer
pale
ale
attempts
very
easy
brew
to
find
in
my
area
thank
goodness
sc
liquor
laws
suck
so
this
beer
is
a
stand
by
for
me
when
going
out
great
copper
color
and
enough
hops
to
know
they
are
there
but
not

goes
down
very
smooth
would
recommend
this
beer
to
all

this
beer
seemed
to
be
more
aggressively
hopped
than
i
recall
from
previous
tastings
it
has
a
lowkey
aroma
of
floral
hops
an
abundant
white
head
lasts
and
produces
nice
latticework
taste
is
subtle
malt
sweetness
with
assertive
hop
bitterness
this
is
a
good
clean
pale
ale
this
beer
looks
good
nice
copper
color
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
smell
is
ok
with
faint
floral
hoppiness
but
otherwise
nothing
overly
distinguishable
the
taste
imo
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
falling
somewhere
in
the
bland
area
between
an
english
and
an
american
pale
ale
without
retaining
any
of
the
better
qualities
of
either
this
beer
is
drinkable
enough
but
in
the
end
it
is
merely
average
orange
in
color
with
a
pale
yellow
head
big
bubbles
in
the
glass
not
alot
of
nose
smooth
mouth
with
a
malt
base
taste
not
enough
hops
bitterness
for
my
liking
pretty
decent
american
pale
good
color
and
clean
finish
this
is
one
of
the
few
easily
available
saranac
brews
in
the
local
area
a
good
pale
ale
but
i
have
had
better
floral
and
hoppy
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
mostly
consistent
of
hops
and
some
grassy
citrusy
hints
still
beats
the
ol
dirty
bass
pours
a
nice
pale
copper
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
shows
good
retention
smell
is
of
strong
malt
and
some
subtle
hops
the
malt
presence
is
the
first
to
arrive
on
the
tongue
and
is
soon
followed
up
by
some
nice
citrusy
hops
very
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
almost
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
a
little
bit
off
for
the
style
but
i
still
thought
it
was
very
good
it
is
a
little
to
hoppy
for
an
english
pale
ale
but
it
is
a
little
to
malty
for
an
american
pale
ale
like
i
said
i
really
liked
this
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
any
pale
ale
fan
copper
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
sweet

and
a
hint
of

and
fruity
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
and
hops
creamy

i
drink
a
lot
of
this
since

has
been
selling
it
for
the
past
couple
of
years
for
4
99
a
six
its
got
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it

is
definitely

to
a
sweet
candy
aroma
malt
was
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overly
so
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
slight
spicyness
of
alcohol
slides
in
at
the
back
very
easygoing
without
being
boring
pours
a
nice
pale
copper
color
with
a
somewhat
creamy
offwhite
colored
head
with
decent
retention
the
body
is
slightly
thin
on
the
nose
the
aroma
was
hoppy
floral
fruity
and
citrusy
notes
on
the
palate
more
hoppy
citrus
flavor
some
fruit
flavors
and
a
nice
bitterness
i
good
pale
ale
for
the
price
exceptional
pale
ale
from
a
mainstream
brewer
this
ale
stands
up
to
many
craft
brewed
examples
rich
fruity
body
with
a
cascade
like
hop
finish
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
hoppier
but
it
wasnt
bad
not
my
favourite
pale
ale
but
it
was
ok
its
a
good
pizza
beer
very
nice
hop
kick
this
beer
has
improved
within
the
past
few
years
and
now
is
extremely
drinkable
no
more
lacking
in
body
or
flavor
nice
hop
characteristics
balance
to
this
beer
great
when
fresh
but
quality
diminishes
relatively
quickly
and
you
dont
know
when
its
fresh
because
there
are
no
dates
a
good
pale
and
pretty
cheap
4
99
a
six
and
5
buck
pitcher
specials
are
easily
had
full
flavored
and
nicely
hopped
wgoldings
notes
a
very
worthy
englishstyle
pale
ale
but
in
some
respects
it
tastes
a
bit
like
a
west
coast
pale
ale
no
matter
its
still
a
very
tasty
brew
