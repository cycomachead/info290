ja
polecam
z
całego
serca
taste
very
similar
i
guess
i
should
try
belgian
candi
sugar
to
understand
what
it
is
that
flavours
this
beer
slightly
sour
but
mostly
sweet
with
the
very
odd
flavour
of
black
walnut
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
this
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
can
see
why
faros
are
rated
lower
than
other
lambics
its
extremely
sweet
and
theres
less
of
a
wild
yeast
presence
still
i
could
easily
see
this
replacing
mimosas
as
a
breakfast
drink
light
sweet
low
abv
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
to
say
they
overdid
the
sweetness
is
an
exaggeration
sour
does
nothing
to
overcome
its
syruplike
feel
and
taste
but
in
the
farthest
reaches
of
aftertaste
the
fruitiness
is
a
strength
and
this
brew
has
some
nice
sour
character
if
ones
goes
looking
wellcrafted
if
ultimately
leaving
one
yearning
for
a
legit
gueze
smells
like
a
lambic
or
gueze
and
looks
the
same
however
the
addition
of
too
much
candy
sugar
makes
it
too
sweet
for
my
taste
little
disappointed
o
this
is
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
because
of
the
unbalanced
level
of
sweetness
in
spite
of
the
wonderful
aromas
seems
like
it
mind
blend
well
with
a
darker
beer
for
some
interesting
concoctions
but
alone
it
is
not
great
overall
i
would
try
again
on
tap
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
in
the
bottle
as
i
said
wanted
to
try
this
style
and
it
is
harder
to
find
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber

a
slight

with
some
effervescence
in

middle
and
finish
the
world
class
flavor
profile
hits
the
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
excellent
intensity
and
reasonable
complexity
it
begins
with
a
blend
of
tart
sweet
fruit
as
the
tartness
fades
brown
candi
sugar
becomes
evident
the
middle
produces
a
light
sourness
that
is
sour
fruit
in
nature
rather
than
vinegar
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
of
sweetsour
tartness
this
one
is
an
excellent
choice
for
lambic
introduction
this
was
a
seasonal
treat
at
cafe
bruges
in
carlisle
pa
delivered
to
me
on
tap
it
had
a
lustrous
dark
red
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
yellowish
head
at
least
in
the
light
i
had
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
berries
and
apple
almost
like
a
root
cellar
smell
after
harvest
the
taste
is
decidedly
tart
with
a
mix
of
apple
and
berry
that
stings
the
tongue
at
the
back
i
detect
an
almost
medicinal
taste
to
it
but
not
syrupy
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
carbonated
but
not
fizzy
i
like
the
tartness
on
the
tongue
that
lingers
afterward
i
am
liking
this
faro
lambic
very
much
and
will
try
to
get
my
hands
on
more
in
the
near
future

it

almost
a

on

a

complemented
by
just
the
right
crispness
from
a
very
consistent
carbonation
the
medium
body
offers
the
right
level
of
support
and
just
a
little
tartness
can
be
felt
on
the
tongue
so
the
sweetness
isnt
cloying
though
it
naturally
keeps
from

all

good

a
very

offering
a
very
nice

particularly
if
you
like
strawberries
this
stuff
is
great
forget
the
ratings
a
much
much
darker
wild
ale
with
a
deep
deep
copper
color
to
it
great
clarity
and
a
lazy
off
white
head
the
nose
here
is
nice
too
sour
but
sweet
from
the
addition
of
candy
sugar
its
sourness
would
be
intense
without
it
there
is
some
oak
on
it
too
moderate
woody
properties
blend
in
with
the
finishing
sweetness
carbonation
is
lively
which
is
nice
and
not
always
the
norm
with
these
belgian
lambic
type
the
darker
grain
and
sugar
give
this
way
more
body
than
others
and
the
wheat
malt
is
lost
a
little
on
it
less
delicate
than
their
cuvee
rene
but
i
like
that
its
low
abv
makes
it
drinkable
even
though
it
is
a
little
thicker
its
almost
flemish
red
like
for
a
second
that
pucker
but
sweet
at
the
same
time
thing
i
like
this
a
lot
this
and
the
cuvee
for
me
are
the
higher
end
of
lindemans
distinct
and
high
quality
their
fruit
stuff
is
maybe
less
compelling
much
of
the
time
but
this
beer
is
really
great
appreciably
unique
o
oh
so
good
as
a
companion
to
after
meal
desserts
extremely
easy
drinking

how

apples

very
pleasant
though
i
like
best
the
usual
gueuze
with
no

notes
capped
and
corked
overall
this
was
a
nice
experience
although
faros
as
a
style
are
sweet
with
cloying
amounts
of
added
sugars
lindemans
sure
knows
how
to
make
a
crazy
sweet
beer
this
beer
for
us
functions
more
as
an
afterdinner
aperitif
much
like
a
port
or
sticky
brandy
we
didnt
find
any
aspect
of
it
to
be
offensive
but
it
is
about
as
refreshing
as
a
tall
warm
glass
of
merlot
there
is
enough
tartness
from
the
yeast
to
help
curb
the
large
base
of
cloy
but
again
the
ultimate
picture
shows
that
stylistically
they
did
things
right
without
too
much
in
one
direction
or
the
other
worth
trying
again
but
let
it
stand
for
a
bit
so
you
dont
have
to
deal
with
the
poor
aroma
o
if
youve
a
sweet
tooth
this
is
a
fine
lil
treat
thankfully
not
quite
the
intensity
of
sugars
as
in
their
fruited
lambics
suppose
it
held
up
fine
after
4
years
interesting
that
given
the
big
sour
aroma
i
was
expecting
some
heavy
tartness
but
it
is
reasonably
friendly
with
sugar
superseding
its
sourness
actually
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
with
a
relatively
lower
complexity
but
it
was
worth
it
to
try
this
over
all
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
seek
out
i
am
sure
than
any
place
selling
this
would
always
carry
a
different
better
beer
to
buy
not
great
but
certainly
not
bad
or
offputting
in
any
way
this
is
my
first
time
trying
lindemans
faro
but
i
had
sampled
several
of
their
other
beers
and
have
found
them
to
be
wellmade
and
enjoyable
without
blowing
my
socks
off
in
any
way
they
pair
well
with
dessert
or
spicy
food
overall
sweet
and
sugary
with
a
lighter
level
of
funk
and
sour
if
looking
for
a
sweeter
and
more
sourbrew
then
this
is
a
good
go
to
but
for
me
it
was
a
little
too
sugary
to
likely
want
on
much
occasion
overall
i
have
never
had
such
an
interesting
lambic
before
so
sweet
so
balanced
mild
sour
and
some
wood
well
worth
the
price
the
taste
is
also
quite
fruity
almost
like
fruit
juice
character
with
a
sour
tart
bite
at
the
end
i
could
take
this
in
small
quantities
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
go
to
regularly
nice
sweet
champagne
like
beer
ive
tried
the
peach
version
and
did
not
like
it
but
this
version
is
really
good
nice
and
sweet
with
a
sweet
smoky
and
slightly
barnyard
aroma
goes
down
great
and
tastes
fresh
slightly
tart
definitely
not
as
sour
as
the
peach
version
i
really
like
this
one
and
would
recommend
highly
it
has
a
slightly
hazy
red
color
and
a
semilarge
but
quickly
disappearing
head
there
is
also
high
carbonation
present
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
citrusy
with
some
hops
noticeable
nothing
bad
yet
so
now
the
taste
i
didnt
know
whether
its
a
cider
freshly
made
wine
or
a
homemade
bear
gone
bad
its
sweet
and
really
sour
at
the
same
time
plus
there
is
too
much
carbonation
here
not
the
best
combo
really
o
good
dessert
beer
like
a
melted
cherry
candy
basically
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
my
first
faro
pours
dark
ambercopper
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
sour
apple
vinegar
and
definite
mint
presence
flavor
is
a
sweet
and
sour
apple
vinegar
nice
lingering
green
apple
presence
this
is
really
neat
and
the
minty
smell
is
strange
but
somehow
good
easy
drinking
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
good
stuff
o
my
first
faro
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
new
glarus
wisconsin
belgian
red
not
sure
if
this
is
representative
of
an
uncommon
style
but
i
will
admit
im
not
likely
to
run
out
and
see
sweet
mediocre
but
only
because
i
love
sweet
all
day
every
day
love
it
score
another
hit
for
the
lambic
crew
for
those
of
us
just
not
into
hops
the
flavor
is
sweet
yet
tart
a
combination
of
nectarine
and
pink
grapefruit
with
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
lingering
on
the
palate
its
crisp
wellcarbonated
a
beautiful
dark
golden
color
with
an
initial
flourish
of
foam
that
rapidly
subsides
mouthfeel
is
substantial
but
not
syrupyyou
know
its
there
and
you
know
it
has
been
there
but
it
doesnt
coat
ones
tongue
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
piper
champagne
with
a
sugar
cube
and
more
fruitiness
wasnt
expecting
quite
this
much
flavor
really
enjoyed
this
one
drinks
like
a
much
bigger

mood
my
state
of
mind
may
have
something
to
do
with
enjoying
this
beer
and
its
style
which
i
havent
sprung
for
in
a
while
at
6
a
bottle
pricey
but
provides
a
worthwhile
experience
overall
a
cheap
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
overall
nice
drop
balanced
flavours
yes
i
know
it
is
not
a
sour
bomb
but
it
goes
down
well
o
ive
never
had
this
style
before
its
quite
sweet
which
im
alright
with
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
little
to
no
lacing
smell
very
sour
almost
pungent
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
the
aroma
which
is
surprising
like
a
sweet
tart
pleasant
actually
mildly
carbonated
dry
and
a
little
bitter
overall
a
very
good
refreshing
lambic
definitely
worth
a
try
this
amberlooking
beer
brings
a
slight
yes
slight
acidity
in
the
aroma
together
with
apples
pears
barnyard
ideas
cinnamon
and
sugarhoney
the
light
body
has
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
the
aftertaste
is
short
malty
wheaty
and
sweet
perhaps
too
sweet
didnt
impress
me
doesnt
have
the
complexity
of
the
gueuzes
or
the
expressiveness
of
the
flanders
sour
ales
first
faro
ive
tried
with
the
promise
that
a
faro
makes
someone
who
has
yet
to
embrace
the
sourness
of
most
lambics
like
the
flavor
profile
of
these
spontaneously
fermented
beers
definitely
has
the
characteristic
sour
slightly
funky
wild
microbe
flavor
of
lambics
but
indeed
finishes
with
a
sugary
sweetness
finishes
a
bit
like
a
sweet
white
wine
definitely
an
approachable
easy
to
drink
sessionable
brew
that
although
not
overly
complex
has
enough
character
to
keep
you
interested
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
amber
with
little
head
formation
or
retention
however
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
drifts
around
the
bottom
and
contributes
to
the
slight
haze
present
the
nose
is
relatively
sweet
with
slight
depth
in
the
form
of
a
subtle
funky
tartness
it
drinks
like
a
very
very
mild
kriek
with
huge
brown
sugar
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
slightly
fruity
tartness
its
medium
bodied
drinkable
and
frankly
a
bit
too
sweet
considering
the
lack
of
fruitcarbonationacidity
im
glad
to
try
a
beer
with
so
much
history
and
im
a
huge
lambic
fan
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
lambics
should
be
blended
with
other
lambics
faro
is
a
unique
lambic
i
always
enjoy
learning
and
trying
lambics
as
they
are
usually
naturally
firmented
faro
is
much
sweeter
than
gueuze
if
you
like
sweet
i
would
stick
with
a
kriek
or
framboise
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
then
go
with
the
gueuze
the
beer
pours
a
ruddy
and
candied
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
that
sits
at
a
fingers
width
the
beers
body
is
clear
but
full
of
floating
particles
the
beer
leaves
a
lacing
of
fat
medium
sized
bubbles
that
leave
a
curtain
along
my
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
largely
funky
sweet
with
cherry
fruit
leather
mixing
with
barnyard
funk
and
sweet
sugars
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
of
salty
funk
with
a
nice
underlying
acidity
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
cherry
leather
moving
into
almost
cidery
juice
with
prickling
malic
acidity
the
flavor
then
moves
quickly
into
a
drier
haylike
bitter
flavor
that
does
not
taste
like
hops
and
really
doesnt
work
with
the
sweet
flavor
that
came
before
it
these
flavors
mix
in
the
finish
creating
a
weird
mix
of
flavors
that
is
sweet
but
not
too
appealing
the
after
taste
is
rather
clean
with
just
a
slight
acidic
pucker
ringing
in
the
mouth
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
thick
in
body
with
a
smooth
velvety
carbonation
on
the
tongue
that
could
stand
a
little
more
prickliness
to
wrangle
in
the
sweet
flavors
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
with
sticky
saliva
on
the
sides
overall
im
a
little
impartial
to
this
beer
it
starts
interesting
and
complex
but
falls
apart
with
the
added
bitter
flavors
and
the
weird
combination
of
the
two
flavors
the
beer
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
that
isnt
what
undoes
the
beer
for
me
this
beer
is
weird
and
i
would
probably
advise
trying
one
of
lindmans
other
offerings
before
i
picked
this
one
up
this
beer
was
not
good
maybe
it
is
good
for
the
style
but
it
was
not
enjoyable
to
drink
o
this
is
a
very
nice
lambicfaro
very
sour
yes
light
uh
huh
but
thats
ok
for
me
o
my
first
faro
style
lambic
so
i
cant
compare
it
to
others
of
the
style
a
very
easy
going
beer
if
you
are
just
coming
off
of
lindemans
sweet
fruit
lambics
this
will
make
a
good
gently
transition
maybe
dial
back
the
sweetness
a
touch
but
other
than
that
a
great
beer
you
shouldnt
hesitate
to
grab
off
the
shelf
o
pretty
sweet
but
that
is
to
be
expected
of
this
style
after
all
i
felt
there
was
enough
sour
pull
to
go
along
with
the
sugars
to
keep
it
pretty
pleasant
and
sessionable
good
partner
with
certain
fruity
tart
like
desserts
im
sure
id
have
again
purchased
a
bottle
at
tacoma
boys
pours
a
clear
ruby
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
leaving
light
splotching
on
top
aromas
of
sourdough
and
yeast
taste
is
sweet
tart
the
sweetness
and
tartness
balance
nicely
granny
smith
apple
like
flavor
light
bitterness
comes
through
at
the
very
end
comparable
to
citrus
peel
has
a
nice
light
feel
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
this
is
good
and
light
bodied
it
has
a
wine
cooler
like
sweetness
but
isnt
over
powering
quick
abrupt
finish
as
well
would
be
nice
to
have
on
occasion
just
to
break
things
up
time
to
time
o
again
a
lindemans
beer
that
isnt
getting
much
love
here
i
think
this
beer
is
tasty
drinkable
and
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
thats
pretty
much
all
you
can
ask
for
if
you
ask
me
this
pours
a
beautiful
semiclear
copper
color
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
yeasty
combined
with
aged
sweet
fruits
there
is
a
sweetness
of
candied
sugar
that
is
like
no
other
very
smooth
tasty
and
unique
style
points
aside
this
is
quite
a
delicious
desert
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
by
itself
after
dinner
in
my
opinion
by
far
the
easiest
lambicfaro
to
find
on
the
market
o
maybe
just
not
my
thing
way
too
sweet
will
try
the
second
half
cold
maybe
ill
put
it
on
pancakes
or
over
ice
cream
or
something
jeez
o
honestly
this
just
tastes
like
grape
juice
i
realize
that
faro
is
sweetened
but
this
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
taste
is
zesty
funky
yeastiness
tart
citric
quality
iron
light
burntsugar
sweetness
o
really
nice
sessionable
beer
great
really
i
thought
this
beer
was
really
good
poured
from
tap
at
tap42
in
ft
lauderdale
pours
a
nice
orange
with
no
head
crazy
wet
horse
blanket
aroma
taste
is
super
sweet
horse
blanket
a
bit
of
funk
and
some
kind
of
fruit
strawberry
maybe
its
so
over
sweet
but
it
mellows
quick
to
reveal
some
actual
flavor
its
ok
but
not
the
best
lambic
i
expect
my
rating
to
be
a
little
over
the
top
poured
from
a
330
ml
bottle
into
a
fluted
glass
coded
bottle
date
this
pours
a
massive
head
filling
34
of
the
fluted
glass
at
one
point
this
initially
quickly
disappates
to
a
3
finger
head
which
then
has
good
retention
ans
leave
a
slight
lacing
the
body
is
a
nice
golden
or
light
amber
color
more
clear
than
i
was
expecting
the
smells
are
of
a
little
funk
some
barnyard
hints
brett
a
little
vinegar
some
ripe
cherries
the
feel
is
medium
light
a
little
tangy
the
taste
is
pretty
good
you
get
the
funky
ripe
sour
vinegar
taste
of
the
gueze
but
then
you
get
a
nice
sweet
balance
i
prefer
the
straight
sour
but
this
is
nice
o
i
would
like
to
try
a
version
of
this
style
that
isnt
sweetened
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
could
see
pushing
it
as
a
beginning
sour
maybe
for
a
wine
drinker
o
a
sweet
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
a
green
finish
faro
is
meant
as
a
desert
and
it
should
be
enjoyable
for
its
purpose
faro
is
worth
a
buy
i
cant
say
ive
had
anything
quite
like
this
faro
before
its
a
highly
enjoyable
curious
mixture
of
smells
and
tastes
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
love
to
have
more
o
a
good
beer
which
i
could
see
myself
drinking
again
but
not
as
good
as
lindemans
cuvee
rene
in
my
opinion
enjoyed
from
my
lindemans
flute
for
this
review
o
tasty
though
a
bit
uninteresting
id
order
another
and
recommend
to
others
i
wont
buy
regularly
better
than
the
other
lindemans
lambics
o
if
you
are
fan
of
duchesse
de
bourgogne
youll
probably
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
the
same
very
sweet
some
what
tart
character
all
be
it
with
a
much
simple
flavor
profile
id
enjoy
this
without
the
sweetness
as
that
would
be
a
pretty
good
lambic
with
a
moderate
sourtartness
to
it
i
probably
wouldt
buy
this
again
its
a
sweet
light
high
carbonated
beer
the
sparkling
wine
of
beer
worth
trying
at
least
once
im
just
getting
in
to
sour
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
my
first
time
trying
a
faro
i
like
it
drinkability
highly
drinkable
as
it
leaves
no
sour
aftertaste
much
more
drinkable
than
a
typical
gueuze
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
yelloworange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
funk
fruit
and
subtle
cherry
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherry
earth
tart
and
sugar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
this
was
my
first
faro
that
i
have
had
so
i
really
went
into
this
one
blind
but
was
hoping
i
would
like
what
i
would
find
in
typical
lindeman
fashion
this
one
was
quite
sweet
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
sickening
there
was
a
really
nice
balance
of
flavors
without
being
overwhelming
which
made
it
quite
easy
to
drink
i
was
hoping
that
my
first
from
the
style
would
be
a
little
more
of
a
harder
to
get
brewery
that
is
known
for
a
little
more
tradition
of
their
styles
but
this
one
wasnt
too
bad
light
body
and
firmer
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
quite
sweet
up
front
as
the
candied
sugar
offsets
the
strong
acidity
get
flavors
of
pepper
apples
white
grapes
and
a
touch
of
ginger
im
new
to
faros
and
im
not
sure
what
the
great
ones
taste
like
but
this
one
fits
the
description
nicely
and
tastes
good
not
much
of
a
finish
but
that
may
be
indicative
of
the
style
i
like
the
sweetness
but
it
may
be
just
a
bit
overdone
if
they
pulled
it
back
just
a
touch
the
beer
might
be
better
o
this
was
my
first
faro
and
my
first
lindemanns
beer
it
was
absolutely
excellent
oone
of
the
sweeter
lambics
ive
had
especially
considering
theres
a
lack
of
fruitiness
to
it
its
okay
but
not
entirely
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
its
the
beer
or
style
that
im
not
fond
of
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
i
can
taste
the
flavors
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
extremely
light
fruity
flavor
tart
and
acidic
with
a
clean
finish
very
similar
to
other
flemish
beers
but
w
an
added
sweetness
no
doubt
from
the
belgian
candi
sugar
that
almost
completely
masks
the
alcohol
bite
review
from
82010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
orange
amber
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
moderate
head
that
dissipated
quickly
no
lacing
sweet
and
sour
apple
and
cherry
flavors
little
malt
or
hops
finishes
with
slightly
sour
fruit
light
and
refreshing
worth
picking
up
when
available
overall
this
one
was
a
challenge
different
from
any
beer
ive
ever
had
aroma
was
offputting
taste
was
simply
unique
not
sure
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
o
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
good
variance
between
sweet
and
sour
reminds
me
of
a
hard
cider
overall
a
good
standard
lambic
ale
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wanted
to
taste
a
baseline
o
a
nice
sweet
style
push
it
up
to
belgian
tripel
levels
of
alcohol
and
youd
have
a
great
dessert
beer
on
your
hands
oreally
interesting
lambic
i
like
this
alot
better
than
the
other
lindemans
lambics
still
has
alot
of
sweetness
but
is
much
more
balanced
on
the
finish
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
reddish
golden
hue
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
a
light
head
and
no
real
lacing
nose
is
fruity
goodness
flavor
follows
suit
as
a
fruity
but
not
cloying
sweet
concoction
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
good
stuff
medium
full
body
extremely
light
effervescence
a
little
cloying
with
a
bit
more
effervescence
this
would
be
5s
in
several
areas
i
actually
prefer
this
to
the
framboise
its
more
like
a
sweeter
version
of
a
flanders
red
a
style
i
really
enjoy
a
lot
puckering
yet
sticky
sweet
light
syrup
to
the
body
prickly
carbonation
that
doesnt
let
go
nice
feel
and
i
can
see
why
a
flute
is
the
appropriate
glassware
3
5
o
this
is
one
of
the
stranger
beers
ive
had
lindemans
lambics
are
usually
like
fruit
juice
and
overly
sweetened
but
still
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
actually
a
little
sour
which
i
dont
get
from
their
beers
except
the
gueze
the
sweetness
is
overdone
here
it
has
a
straight
sugar
taste
unfermented
raw
sugar
i
dunno
if
its
to
faro
style
but
this
sweetness
is
almost
undrinkable
overall
another
great
beer
my
lindemans
when
i
saw
the
initial
low
rating
i
was
skeptical
but
i
think
this
beer
is
better
than
any
of
the
fruit
styles
i
quite
liked
the
cuvée
rené
better
but
this
is
another
great
showing
certainly
for
people
with
a
sweet
tooth
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
great
showing
o
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
to
candy
super
sweet
i
could
definitely
drink
this
beer
for
dessert
after
a
hearty
meal
very
good
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
beers
of
this
style
overall
and
pleasant
blend
of
sweet
tart
and
funk
definitely
worth
a
try
body
is
mediumlight
and
carbonation
is
medium
could
even
be
higher
to
give
this
more
crispness
and
snap
not
nearly
dry
enough
a
boring
onenote
beer
and
a
discouraging
introduction
to
the
faro
style
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
at
an
overly
sweet
beer
from
lindemans
not
much
to
see
here
overall
seems
overly
sweet
but
tastes
okay
good
for
desert
as
mentioned
overall
decent
but
ifor
once
would
prefer
a
more
balancing
sourness
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
that
despite
its
high
carbonation
it
is
still
a
very
sweet
it
is
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
people
that
are
geting
started
on
sours
and
lambics
o
just
too
funky
and
weird
with
the
sugary
sweetness
ugh
d
overall
an
excellent
combination
of
flavors
while
i
certainly
wouldnt
consider
this
a
sour
it
has
enough
tart
and
funky
flavors
to
feed
that
craving
as
well
as
a
host
of
sweetened
fruity
and
rather
interesting
flavors
to
give
it
a
more
unique
feel
another
great

id
always
been
reticent
about
the
so
call
sugar
lambic
now
ive
changed
my
mind
then
i
will
have
many
more
like
this
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
that
gently
foams
this
up
on
the
palate
resulting
mouthfeel
is
pillowy
and
smooth
with
a
very
tart
dry

that
makes
not

i
could
see
this
as
a
beerstyle
that
might
not
appeal
to
everyone
but
it
certainly
is
delicious
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
though
a
little
sweet
to
really
be
sessionable
i
also
found
this
appealed
to
a
few
friends
that
are
more

than

with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
of
the
style
the
sweet
candi
sugar
and
fruitiness
dominated
a
little
too
much
for
me
even
for
the
style
and
overshadowed
the
sourness
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
faros
but
i
thought
drie
fonteinen
straffe
winter
was
significantly
better
o
a
pretty
decent
and
interesting
beer
that
is
both
sweet
and
sour
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
still
not
bad
as
it
is
my
first
example
of
the
style
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
o
meh
had
to
try
it
because
i
never
had
the
style
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
it
out
again
o
its
difficult
because
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
its
far
too
sweet
for
me
maybe
if
this
16
oz
bottle
was
half
or
maybe
just
having
4
oz
with
dessert
but
a
traditional
lambic
would
still
be
far
superior
so
from
what
i
read
this
is
all
approximately
true
to
style
ill
give
it
a
slightly
above
average
3
5
o
this
is
interesting
stuff
though
i
find
it
pretty
one
dimensional
i
admittedly
have
not
tried
any
faros
and
will
try
to
do
so
soon
o
this
is
first
faro
ive
tried
so
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
compare
it
to
pretty
good
but
it
has
its
flaws
d
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
an
example
of
this
style
for
a
while
now
not
super
easy
to
find
very
sweet
very
nice
sipping
beer
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
of
these
side
by
side
and
see
where
else
this
style
can
go
overall
my
first
experience
with
the
style
it
seems
more
balanced
than
other
lambic
styles
i
know
lindemans
adds
sweeteners
to
their
beers
but
correct
me
if
im
wrong
that
faros
are
supposed
to
be
sweetened
a
bit
i
thought
i
read
that
somewhere
anyway
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
id
drink
a
bottle
of
to
myself
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
bit
of
a
weird
finish
as
it
warms
so
try
to
drink
it
more
chilled
definitely
a
dessert
beer
perhaps
suitable
to
a
brunch
the
day
after
a
summer
celebration
from
the
little
faro
i
had
this
was
not
my
best
a
lot
of
sugar
and
barley
looked
nice
brown
colour
with
no
head
smelled
like
barley
cereal
tasted
barley
cereal
and
sugar
average
mouthfeel
though
it
was
a
little
tart
backup
up
by
much
sweetness
drinkable
with
a
good
lunch
its
ok
i
think
the
sweetness
if
heavy
handed
and
too
much
its
my
first
faro
so
i
have
no
perspective
on
the
aggressiveness
within
this
example
overall
the
wife
says
buy
this
if
you
enjoy
the
experience
of
walking
down
a
cheese
aisle
in
europe
it
has
many
of
the
same
notes
pair
it
with
a
dark
crusty
bread
not
recommended
with
a
meal
the
husband
says
buy
this
for
a
unique
taste
experience
and
lambic
flavor
profile
othis
really
reminds
me
of
a
candied
apple
as
this
is
not
a
style
i
am
familiar
with
i
cant
really
speak
to
style
but
this
is
probably
not
something
i
would
go
running
back
to
still
interesting
to
try
nonetheless
this
one
was
interesting
gave
it
a
good
poure
into
a
tuplip
glass
and
looked
it
over
the
color
was
a
a
shade
of
brown
with
a
very
thin
white
head
on
top
that
faded
almost
right
away
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
actually
quite
funky
i
expected
this
to
be
on
the
tart
side
once
i
took
a
sip
the
taste
however
was
not
tart
at
all
really
i
know
that
its
a
lindemans
product
but
even
they
have
some
sourness
in
them
this
was
surprisingly
sweeter
than
all
the
others
ive
had
from
them
the
taste
of
brown
sugar
was
throughout
the
beer
there
was
just
a
touch
of
funk
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
nothing
too
impressive
really
overall
this
was
something
that
i
found
to
be
quite
interesting
and
id
like
to
have
more
of
this
style
one
day
just
to
compare
o
this
was
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
faro
lambics
and
to
be
honest
they
are
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
overall
its
a
pretty
good
brew
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
them
another
happy
choice
from
lindemans
dr
very
drinkable
for
the
style
of
good
quality
and
priced
perchance
a
bit
high
at
least
stateside
id
have
it
again
preferably
on
cask
its
simplicity
holds
it
back
overall
i
will
buy
again
this
marks
my
first
faro
and
its
left
me
satisfied
simple
well
balanced
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
seems
like
something
id
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
and
tonight
i
was
hopefully
more
beers
of
this
style
will
hold
back
on
the
sugar
a
lot
probably
a
good
faro
however
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
i
like
em
high
and
dry
overall
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
it
its
a
unique
twist
to
the
sourness
taste
is
very
odd
it
is
slightly
sourtart
with
a
very
sweet
almost
syrupy
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
no
frutiness
like
with
most
fruited
lambics
its
an
interesting
style
o
i
wouldnt
so
much
call
this
a
sour
it
does
taste
like
candy
it
is
good
definitely
something
worth
trying
if
your
into
something
sweeter
o
ive
never
had
a
faro
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
its
very
interesting
probably
the
sweetest
beer
ive
tried
but
it
was
palatable
with
some
good
sour
notes
o
ok
looks
like
i
knocked
off
the
faro
style
is
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
after
a
bit
of
research
it
seems
to
be
the
difference
between
a
sip
and
a
swig
if
youre
doing
small
sips
this
seems
really
sweet
if
you
take
a
few
big
swigs
the
sourness
just
sticks
in
your
throat
and
dominates
interesting
implication
for
tasting
styles
o
its
a
decent
beer
and
can
see
why
its
popular
would
probably
be
more
into
this
on
a
hot
day
but
again
i
know
the
point
is
the
candied
sugar
but
its
just
too
much
for
my
tastes
overall
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
in
to
not
being
a
great
fan
of
sweet
beers
so
i
rated
it
on
the
generous
side
its
brewed
to
taste
the
way
it
does
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
affects
the
smell
and
i
found
it
rather
offputting
md
a
contradictory
beer
both
dry
and
juicy
on
the
tongue
sweetness
in
spades
light
and
effervescent
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
introduction
to
a
new
belgian
style
o
i
understand
that
the
beer
needs
to
be
appreciated
in
the
context
of
the
style
so
i
will
judge
it
accordingly
but
i
will
not
be
drinking
a
faro
again
this
bottle
is
well
over
a
year
old
poured
dark
amber
not
much
head
and
disappears
quick
carbonation
dissipates
quick
as
well
probably
the
age
very
sweet
on
the
nose
tart
and
caramel
apple
the
flavor
is
very
along
the
lines
if
a
caramel
apple
slightly
sour
and
tart
barnyard
as
well
the
caramel
apple
is
amazingly
strong
considering
there
is
no
fruit
not
dry
enough
i
wish
it
would
dry
up
faster
on
the
tongue
but
it
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
very
nice
and
refreshing
my
wife
is
a
huge
fan
and
im
becoming
one
as
well
im
going
to
hunt
down
some
more
faros
to
try
after
this
introduction
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
and
very
sweet
with
lots
of
artificial
sweetness
lots
of
candy
sugar
and
syrup
with
subtle
tart
funk
and
sweet
dark
fruit
hints
of
cherry
grape
and
other
dark
berries
produce
an
overwhelming
sweetness
that
lingers
into
a
sling
dry
finish
o
i
didnt
find
this
one
as
unpleasant
as
some
of
the
other
reviews
it
doesnt
look
or
smell
great
but
its
smooth
and
has
a
delicate
sourness
a
tad
too
sweet
but
thats
par
for
the
course
with
this
style
pours
a
caramel
tinted
amber
color
relatively
clear
with
some
active
carbonation
bubbly
with
a
decent
cap
of
prickly
offwhite
froth
little
retention
or
lacing
scent
brings
funky
and
earthy
yeast
notes
with
fruity
like
candy
sweetness
in
the
background
taste
leads
with
a
big
rush
of
candied
sugar
that
becomes
somewhat
cloying
as
the
bottle
approaches
its
finish
tart
and
funk
notes
seem
aggressive
and
blend
with
the
sugar
to
produce
an
odd
flavor
light
vinous
notes
medium
bodied
active
carbonation
lingering
finish
overall
strong
sweetness
and
lacks
complexity
of
fruit
lambics
and
subtlety
of
gueze
this
was
my
first
sampling
of
this
style
i
believe
poured
into
a
lindemans
flute
glass
a
thick
burnt
caramel
color
with
a
few
stray
bubbles
gracing
the
surface
very
sweet
nose
candi
candy
and
raisins
taste
was
obviously
very
sweet
as
well
candylike
and
fruity
even
though
there
isnt
actually
any
fruit
in
it
raisins
permeated
my
palate
with
strawberries
and
white
wine
coming
in
midpalate
and
sweet
dark
sugars
finishing
off
with
a
hint
of
oak
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
with
a
syrupy
sweetness
i
just
didnt
care
too
much
for
good
for
a
glass
but
thats
probably
it
for
me
id
be
interested
in
sampling
other
brewers
cracks
at
the
style
i
noticed
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
overall
it
felt
thinmedium
it
was
good
as
a
dessert
beer
but
i
would
never
drink
this
again
unless
i
was
in
the
same
scenario
finishing
with
it
its
a
little
harsh
on
your
palate
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
and
continue
on
with
anything
else
aroma
was
fruity
like
wine
poured
clear
pale
coppery
with
thin
creamy
beige
head
head
short
lived
some
lacing
of
glass
taste
is
sweet
sweet
sweet
liquid
candied
sweet
potato
slightly
fizzy
soda
like
feel
and
pleasant
sweet
aftertaste
expensive
but
worth
it
o
i
had
trouble
finishing
this
glass
i
have
had
a
few
faros
before
but
for
some
reason
this
one
really
got
to
me
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
any
time
soon
im
charmed
by
this
beer
poured
a
1
5
offwhite
head
looks
clear
but
it
has
an
interesting
burnt
orange
color
verging
on
amber
smells
mildly
sour
taste
has
both
sweet
and
sour
thanks
to
the
belgian
candi
sugar
and
the
lambic
style
of
fermentation
respectively
and
it
has
some
intriguing
hard
to
define
tastes
and
qualities
overall
well
i
guess
faro
is
always
this
sweet
i
mean
it
is
lindemans
after
all
but
it
certainly
can
work
and
doesnt
hurt
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
sugar
bomb
but
i
am
curious
if
this
style
made
by
cantillon
or
drie
fontinen
is
considerably
different
well
see
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
low
abv
o
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
my
first
faro
and
ive
gotta
say
i
dont
mind
it
at
all
overall
drinkability
i
feel
this
beer
is
an
acquired
taste
and
i
have
not
yet
acquired
it
interesting
in
smell
good
appearance
but
i
couldnt
finish
it
the
mrs
who
likes
wine
really
enjoyed
it
but
not
me
oh
well
maybe
i
need
to
try
one
from
another
brewer
and
see
what
i
think
o
it
was
tough
to
drink
all
12oz
because
of
the
sweetness
but
overall
i
enjoyed
it
o
overall
this
is
a
very
weird
style
for
me
like
someone
poured
confectioners
sugar
into
an
average
lambic
just
too
over
the
top
sweet
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
the
style
but
i
wont
be
returning
to
it
theres
only
7
beers
of
this
type
brewed
right
now
according
to
this
site
try
whatever
one
you
can
get
your
hands
on
wow
very
sweet
but
the
lambic
character
is
still
there
the
only
other
faro
ive
had
was
a
1988
eylenbosch
and
it
had
traces
of
sweetness
but
nothing
on
this
level
poured
from
a
375ml
bottle
into
my
chouffe
nice
goblet
this
is
my
first
faro
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
a
very
clear
amber
color
very
little
head
recedes
to
nothing
no
visible
bubbles
but
its
carbonated
looks
like
a
hard
cider
smells
sorta
ciderish
as
well
brown
sugar
apple
spicy
and
the
lambic
funkiness
hiding
in
the
background
not
too
much
hint
of
the
coming
tartness
light
tartness
on
the
front
end
very
full
bodied
candied
sugar
flavor
really
well
rounded
tart
red
apple
flavors
medium
tart
finish
a
little
funkiness
lingers
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
nice
little
bubbles
as
i
swish
i
really
dig
this
o
weird
funky
sweet
earthy
metallic
weedy
interesting
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifer
clear
dark
caramel
pour
light
fizzy
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sugary
with
notes
of
barnyard
funk
the
beer
is
definitely
sweet
aggessively
so
there
are
caramel
notes
and
some
sweet
fruit
notes
but
the
candi
sugar
is
mainly
what
you
taste
the
beer
is
actually
light
and
somewhat
refreshing
in
a
sugary
cola
sort
of
way
my
first
faro
and
it
was
kinda
what
i
expected
not
really
my
thing
but
it
was
not
bad
would
like
to
try
another
d
no
thanks
i
know
these
are
supposed
to
be
funky
but
wow
too
much
for
me
how
do
you
pair
this
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
sticky
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
not
something
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
this
is
pretty
good
and
although
ive
never
had
a
faro
before
pretty
damn
close
to
dead
on
for
the
style
for
what
i
understand
its
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
that
is
one
of
the
marks
of
the
style
while
it
definitely
has
the
sweet
candi
sugar
notes
from
the
sugar
addition
it
also
has
light
lactic
acid
and
brett
complexity
giving
it
a
depth
i
have
not
found
in
other
sweetened
lambics
bravo
to
lindemans
for
keeping
this
rare
style
alive
overall
this
is
my
first
faro
lambic
and
its
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
lambic
style
a
good
beer
this
is
a
style
id
be
willing
to
explore
more
overall
this
is
definitely
not
what
i
think
of
when
im
wanting
a
beer
its
almost
a
beverage
in
a
class
on
its
own
i
suppose
this
is
probably
the
case
with
all
the
lambic
beers
it
definitely
isnt
bad
though
it
could
compliment
some
meals
well
i
think
that
once
you
get
past
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
normal
beer
it
is
easier
to
appreciate
the
flavours
going
on
i
dont
know
when
ill
have
this
again
but
i
certainly
wont
avoid
it
it
was
pretty
good
but
a
12
oz
bottle
went
a
long
way
o
im
reasonably
sure
this
is
not
a
particularly
faithful
representation
of
a
faro
i
would
liken
lindemans
faro
to
the
fruit
ales
in
new
glarus
portfolio
a
comparison
that
works
in
its
favor
if
it
were
more
available
and
a
bit
cheaper
this
beer
could
become
a
guilty
pleasure
plus
the
wife
loves
it
overall
very
nice
lambic
never
had
a
faro
but
id
try
it
again
d
the
5
75
price
tag
for
a
12
oz
bottle
was
definitely
worth
it
to
me
this
is
one
unique
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
share
with
a
few
certain
people
the
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
is
a
complete
win
and
is
a
delight
to
drink
the
taste
is
as
the
nose
leads
on
with
spice
caramel
heavy
sugar
influence
and
mild
oak
flavor
accenting
w
subtle
spiciness
and
lots
of
residual
sugar
on
the
palate
as
the
sweetness
lingers
overall
this
is
not
a
style
i
think
that
many
can
compare
to
base
on
the
fact
so
few
are
available
in
the
u
s
but
this
comes
off
like
their
other
lambics
too
sweet
the
only
missing
ingredient
is
a
fruit
addition
drink
eh
for
international
beer
day
was
all
i
had
as
import
wasnt
the
best
wasnt
the
worst
a
little
too
sweet
little
unbalanced
wont
come
back
to
this
one
o
overall
this
is
a
good
and
drinkable
lambic
but
high
levels
of
sweetness
are
in
question
with
the
balance
of
the
blending
none
the
less
a
good
brew
o
overall
not
a
great
faro
just
way
to
sweet
and
not
balanced
at
all
the
sugar
dominates
and
makes
it
tough
to
drink
my
girlfriend
liked
it
quite
a
bit
though
and
helped
me
finish
the
bottle
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
go
for
the
3f
faro
if
youre
interested
in
trying
the
style
dark
amber
color
fruity
nose
and
acid
as
with
candied
fruits
like
apple
and
cherry
body
without
being
too
nauseating
sweet
sour
and
bitter
without
being
powerful
aftertaste
of
wood
especially
cork
another
aftertaste
is
reminiscent
of
the
gastric
juice
a
very
young
lambic
is
surely
the
basis
of
the
beverage
very
easy
to
drink
without
being
artificial
or
lacking
in
flavor
o
while
id
welcome
a
chance
to
try
another
example
of
the
style
i
dont
think
faros
are
for
me
the
sweetfunky
ratio
was
way
out
of
whack
here
o
ive
never
had
a
faro
before
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
brett
was
kept
to
a
minimum
as
well
as
the
tartness
i
was
actually
expecting
more
tartness
and
less
sweetness
with
the
powering
sweetness
this
one
should
be
saved
for
dessert
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
tight
ivory
head
theres
a
very
solid
cascade
of
bubbles
working
up
the
side
of
the
glass
there
is
a
huge
staying
power
on
the
head
due
to
the
carbonation
looks
good
the
aroma
is
a
dichotomy
between
barnyard
and
sour
fruityness
there
is
an
upfront
mustyness
that
plays
with
an
underlying
sour
apple
fruityness
the
aroma
is
actually
a
bit
subtle
the
flavor
brings
a
mild
tartness
as
i
take
the
first
sip
following
this
comes
a
tart
cherry
mixed
with
grape
skin
and
black
currant
there
is
a
lot
of
fruit
in
there
the
aftertaste
brings
some
mustyness
and
a
slight
raw
wheat
flavor
as
well
this
one
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
lively
carbonation
not
having
any
other
experiences
with
a
faro
i
really
dont
have
a
point
of
comparison
but
knowing
a
bit
about
the
style
i
think
this
falls
with
a
standard
deviation
of
what
i
would
have
expected
before
opening
it
i
like
it
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
would
fit
the
bill
when
i
wanted
something
sourish
but
not
puckering
light
brown
with
an
orange
tint
and
a
little
bit
hazy
some
fine
offwhite
foam
appeared
during
the
pour
and
lingered
for
quite
some
time
producing
a
lot
of
spotty
lacing
earthy
nose
tart
notes
of
apples
and
grapes
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
and
sourness
quite
sweet
in
flavour
this
really
tames
the
tartness
that
seems
to
be
somewhat
hidden
by
the
sugar
apples
and
brown
sugar
sort
of
cidery
and
grapey
dry
on
the
palate
carbonation
was
light
but
enough
to
lift
the
body
and
keep
it
from
feeling
dead
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
one
that
id
certainly
have
again
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
im
thinking
this
would
go
better
with
food
rather
than
on
its
own
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
good
and
the
flavor
is
nice
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
this
is
my
first
faro
so
i
dont
really
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
the
size
of
the
bottle
is
perfect
because
the
beer
is
too
sweet
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
all
in
all
though
i
think
its
a
good
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
find
that
i
enjoy
it
more
if
i
split
a
bottle
the
whole
bottle
can
be
slightly
overwhelming
being
so
sweet
and
all
picked
this
up
for
a
friend
who
wanted
a
fruity
beer
and
she
loved
it
personally
this
is
a
once
in
a
while
kind
of
thing
definitely
worth
trying
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orangebrown
color
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
there
is
some
slight
sediment
that
is
floating
around
in
the
glass
after
the
pour
sticky
globs
of
lacing
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sweet
funky
musty
with
a
slight
yeast
aroma
taste
is
pretty
sweet
with
some
funkmust
flavors
being
covered
up
by
sugar
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sticky
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
from
lindemans
and
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
tried
but
the
sweetness
is
slightly
cloying
and
i
am
not
too
sure
i
would
drink
this
one
very
often
the
aroma
is
more
enjoyable
than
the
taste
it
contains
more
funk
sour
apple
and
only
a
hint
of
the
sweetness
to
follow
on
the
tongue
this
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
cant
get
into
this
beer
still
not
entirely
undrinkable
i
could
of
been
half
way
into
a
sixer
of
yuengling
with
that
money
overall
im
still
fairly
new
to
appreciating
and
enjoying
sour
beers
but
even
i
know
this
is
a
miss
not
sure
what
exactly
a
faro
is
supposed
to
taste
like
because
this
is
my
first
but
as
an
avid
beer
drinker
i
know
what
is
goodgreatbad
and
this
is
definitely
blah
d
like
i
said
this
is
almost
too
inviting
to
put
down
within
a
few
big
gulps
no
taste
of
alcohol
or
even
a
heavy
malt
taste
for
that
matter
a
bigger
bottle
of
this
could
spell
a
very
happy
night
o
it
was
good
but
the
sweetness
killed
it
for
me
probably
best
paired
with
a
rich
dessert
would
love
to
try
another
faro
to
compare
this
one
to
as
some
point
i
think
i
may
prefer
other
lambics
to
this
style
this
one
doesnt
strike
a
good
chord
with
me
one
of
the
first
things
it
made
me
think
of
is
a
sour
apple
cider
it
reminds
me
of
this
alot
of
ways
because
the
sugary
base
sticks
to
your
mouth
like
apple
cider
and
because
of
the
acidity
one
of
the
big
things
i
like
about
wilds
is
the
dryness
not
here
at
all
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
again
o
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
too
musty
for
me
kind
of
like
honey
flavored
gym
socks
this
is
a
unique
brew
the
candi
sugar
sweetness
mixed
with
the
sourness
is
very
interesting
overall
i
would
say
that
i
am
not
impressed
and
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
ever
again
i
was
just
curious
of
the
style
and
wanted
to
try
it
im
sure
that
a
faro
could
be
delicious
if
done
correctly
but
this
beer
is
just
way
too
sweet
poured
a
light
caramel
some
faint
mustyness
in
the
aroma
almost
overpoweringly
sweet
there
is
some
lambic
tartness
lurking
deep
in
the
depths
but
it
is
overlayered
with
fathoms
of
candy
sugar
on
one
level
this
could
almost
pass
for
a
very
sweet
sparkling
white
wine
that
was
a
bit
too
long
in
the
bottle
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
had
the
lambic
quality
been
allowed
to
shine
through
through
just
a
bit
more
do
this
beer
if
you
like
the
style
keep
in
mind
that
sweetness
is
part
of
the
package
of
a
faro
is
so
insanely
drinkable
helped
by
a
low
abv
price
keeps
me
from
drinking
a
ton
though
but
really
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
give
to
your
ladyfriend
when
she
says
she
doesnt
like
beer
or
your
dudefriend
when
he
thinks
all
the
beers
you
drink
are
too
big
not
that
id
know
about
that
all
in
all
an
interesting
beer
that
is
obviously
leaps
and
bounds
from
some
of
the
other
lindemans
at
the
price
point
there
are
other
sours
id
much
prefer
as
the
candi
sugar
seems
to
muddy
up
the
clean
tartness
that
lies
underneath
might
hit
the
spot
if
i
was
in
the
right
mood
very
interesting
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
for
this
price
i
guess
i
prefer
something
much
more
sour
assertive
and
funky
its
nice
the
sourness
seems
balanced
by
the
sugar
at
first
and
was
quite
refreshing
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
the
sweetness
comes
off
a
bit
cloying
splitting
a
bottle
would
be
good
pleasant
and
worth
trying
drinkability
forst
faro
and
loved
it
undertaed
sour
ale
overall
not
too
bad
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
the
style
before
making
any
further
judgements
in
this
category
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
a
bit
odd
in
the
smell
and
taste
category
but
i
hear
thats
fit
to
style
notes
soft
and
accessible
style
sugary
and
not
for
most
expected
ranges
of
beer
but
there
is
room
for
it
reminds
me
of
the
soft
cider
experiences
of
the
sugary
kind
a
la
el
gaitero
in
spain
and
in
that
context
it
may
serve
a
similar
function
low
alc
decent
range
of
flavor
sweet
accessible
an
interesting
style
to
keep
in
mind
taste
goes
into
caramelized
apples
a
bit
of
wild
cherries
very
sweet
and
very
sour
certainly
a
great
thirst
quencher
o
not
a
bad
beer
very
sweet
but
drinkable
almost
a
flemish
winecooler
im
always
down
to
try
a
new
style
so
here
is
my
first
faro
shared
with
zep9865
during
a
mini
tasting
this
beer
pours
an
orangish
amber
in
color
with
a
light
cream
colored
lacing
around
the
glass
it
is
very
clear
and
translucent
it
smells
like
it
should
be
tasty
it
smells
of
candied
fruit
and
has
some
syrupy
raspberry
to
it
the
flavors
are
very
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
as
zep
said
my
girlfriend
would
love
this
it
is
so
flavorful
and
full
of
sweet
fruits
its
almost
like
a
fruity
soda
and
reminds
me
of
cherry
dr
pepper
it
is
a
little
sticky
on
the
palate
but
i
guess
i
should
expect
that
from
such
a
sweet
beer
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
worthy
trying
to
knock
out
a
new
style
overall
decent
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
its
nice
light
and
fruity
i
went
to
this
blind
and
it
is
my
first
faro
ive
had
so
i
dont
know
how
representative
this
is
of
the
style
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
cheers
o
well
done
from
what
i
understand
the
style
to
be
d
this
contrast
between
the
earthy
funky
aroma
and
the
sweetened
soda
like
flavor
is
really
different
from
most
other
beers
it
shows
the
funky
complexity
of
its
base
beer
much
better
than
lindemans
less
traditional
sweetened
lambics
and
despite
the
strange
descriptors
that
i
am
forced
to
use
in
relating
the
flavors
it
is
actually
pretty
enjoyable
unlike
the
sweetened
fruit
lambics
the
sourness
is
able
to
show
through
a
bit
along
with
the
wild
character
and
thanks
to
the
tradition
behind
this
style
you
arent
left
with
the
feeling
that
they
ruined
something
wonderful
to
appeal
to
the
masses
if
you
know
what
you
are
getting
into
with
this
beer
you
can
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
i
can
see
it
being
a
really
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
because
i
usually
love
these
belgians
with
the
sour
and
musty
wild
yeast
but
this
is
faaar
too
sweet
such
that
the
sugar
drowns
out
the
nicer
flavors
of
sour
apricot
ans
musty
yeast
and
so
its
also
a
little
bit
onenotethe
front
of
your
tongue
is
the
back
of
your
tongue
so
to
speak
thin
kind
of
acerbic
body
i
see
the
potential
in
the
style
but
i
dont
really
know
that
i
would
want
to
drink
this
particular
brew
again
drinkability
this
beer
is
too
sweet
for
me
i
love
what
it
stands
for
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
which
i
certainly
could
do
with
another
lambic
that
being
said
i
love
sours
and
would
drink
another
if
given
the
chance
o
i
can
really
see
how
this
would
be
a
tasty
beer
style
but
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
o
decent
faro
at
times
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
my
palette
and
i
felt
it
was
lacking
balance
in
that
aspect
good
for
the
ladies
overall
have
enjoyed
at
the
itap
house
chesterfield
mo
before
and
had
the
same
reaction
as
this
time
having
at
home
really
enjoy
these
sour
ales
now
that
ive
been
introduced
to
the
style
from
my
cousin
and
will
keep
searching
for
new
and
better
ones
the
drinkability
is
unreal
with
this
faro
as
it
disappears
from
the
glass
in
no
time
but
very
sweetsour
this
may
turn
people
off
from
the
start
but
i
say
you
just
have
to
get
used
to
it
and
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
would
say
this
is
one
of
my
top
sours
from
lindenmans
brouwerij
o
a
good
take
on
this
lambic
varietal
very
easy
to
drink
but
far
to
sweet
for
me
the
girlfriend
liked
it
quite
a
bit
lindemans
faro
is
a
crystal
clear
amber
brew
thats
topped
with
a
white
film
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
very
sweet
tangy
candy
aroma
its
light
bodied
and
lively
with
a
dry
finish
it
tastes
very
sweet
and
tangy
theres
almost
a
hint
of
green
apple
its
the
lindemans
flavor
without
the
fruit
this
is
funky
candy
juice
its
a
very
unique
beverage
thats
fun
to
drink
drinkability
i
like
the
strong
taste
of
a
stiff
lambic
but
its
nice
to
have
a
faro
every
now
and
then
this
does
exactly
as
advertised
its
a
nice
refreshing
midday
drink
overalli
will
almost
certainly
purchase
this
again
at
some
point
and
am
really
into
lambics
just
in
general
this
seems
a
bit
more
straight
forward
than
a
blended
geuze
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
not
the
most
stellar
example
of
the
style
unfortunately
its
the
only
one
that
comes
to
the
states
giving
the
style
a
bad
rep
notes
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
my
palate
is
confused
is
it
a
tart
beer
trying
to
be
sweet
or
a
sweet
beer
trying
to
be
tartsour
it
is
interesting
if
nothing
else
d
i
didnt
find
this
easier
to
drink
than
lambic
but
the
flavors
are
nice
just
a
bit
to
cloying
for
my
liking
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
much
more
when
it
was
chilled
its
probably
a
good
place
to
start
for
someone
looking
to
try
lambic
for
the
first
time
i
think
a
wine
drinker
may
like
this
as
well
drinkability
much
better
than
i
thought
this
was
my
first
faro
not
bad
at
all
d
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
the
cpj
this
was
my
first
faro
but
may
not
be
my
last
if
i
can
find
one
from
cantillon
or
boon
hopefully
theyre
a
little
more
evenhanded
with
the
sugar
d
damn
tasty
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
wild
ales
that
i
have
had
so
far
i
really
enjoy
the
balance
between
sour
and
sweet
d
very
sweet
but
enjoyable
id
drink
this
again
but
not
more
than
one
small
bottle
at
a
time
this
is
like
a
less
intense
apple
cider
vinegar
taste
with
a
candy
sweetness
smell
is
sour
like
fermented
apples
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
thin
almost
non
existent
head
taste
is
pleasantly
sweet
with
a
sort
of
grape
fruit
like
bittersour
citrus
finish
has
a
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
that
isnt
distracting
from
the
flavor
it
is
really
really
really
easy
to
drink
drinkability
a
very
good
sipper
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
the
sourness
is
not
puckering
or
harsh
i
could
have
several
throughout
the
course
of
a
day
skal
d
this
is
very
drinkable
however
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
one
myself
and
even
that
is
a
bit
much
would
recommend
sharing
with
a
friend
as
a
dessert
d
a
dessert
beer
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
but
a
great
dessert
beer
after
a
tasty
meal
like
thanksgiving
or
a
holiday
poured
a
golden
red
with
a
fizzy
head
that
died
quick
a
mix
of
tart
cherriesberries
with
some
minor
sugary
sweetness
in
the
fruit
as
well
as
a
touch
of
the
typical
belgian
yeast
strain
very
light
and
sweet
and
a
fluffy
yeast
touch
very
little
in
terms
of
complexity
but
still
a
good
drinker
a
minor
tart
fruit
taste
like
cherry
with
some
sharpness
from
these
tart
flavors
and
carbonation
and
is
wellbalanced
overall
though
id
say
this
is
a
sugary
sweet
beer
that
is
great
for
a
dessert
beer
its
an
easy
drinker
lots
of
fun
little
nuances
nothing
offensive
about
it
its
my
first
faro
and
im
interested
to
taste
more
of
the
style
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
light
beige
head
the
retention
of
the
head
as
a
skim
was
fine
and
it
left
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
wild
yeast
must
and
earth
sweet
fruit
and
berries
the
flavors
were
of
berries
sweet
tart
berries
similar
to
lingonberries
then
yeast
tart
and
sweet
complex
yet
drinkable
sour
yet
balanced
i
wasnt
dazzled
but
i
decided
i
liked
the
style
as
a
result
of
trying
this
beer
the
sweetness
was
noticeably
high
on
the
overall
scale
of
beers
but
the
strong
tart
element
really
came
through
in
the
right
way
none
the
less
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
pleasant
any
faro
beer
is
novel
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
will
i
try
it
again
perhaps
pours
a
reddish
orange
brown
color
with
a
skim
head
that
is
slightly
off
white
and
reduces
to
skim
there
is
lacing
that
fades
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
candied
yeast
and
almost
a
red
wine
like
scent
the
tatse
has
a
red
wine
like
start
which
gives
way
to
the
candied
yeast
taste
and
a
syrupy
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
slightly
stingy
like
champagne
the
drinkablility
is
good
a
nice
sweet
taste
and
an
easy
drink
a
very
enjoyable
expierance
this
isnt
bad
but
isnt
really
what
i
was
looking
for
a
little
too
much
on
the
sugary
side
of
things
drinkability
this
is
both
my
first
faro
and
my
first
lambic
it
seemed
a
good
way
to
ease
into
the
style
and
while
my
experience
is
limited
so
far
i
already
know
that
i
can
enjoy
tart
sourness
in
a
beer
on
the
whole
i
found
this
a
beer
for
slow
sipping
but
at
times
i
confess
i
also
found
the
sweetness
a
bit
much
partly
because
im
a
taster
for
artificial
sweetners
and
so
as
with
many
introductions
now
that
ive
had
this
one
ill
not
be
returning
often
to
this
particular
beer
or
style
of
lambic
very
often
except
to
sample
someone
elses
version
of
a
faro
to
see
if
i
like
it
a
bit
better
also
to
be
fair
this
seems
to
be
intended
as
a
dessert
beer
which
is
not
how
i
drank
it
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
certainly
a
favorable
alternative
if
you
prefer
a
much
less
harsh
type
of
lambic
beer
dpretty
easy
drinking
considering
the
sweetness
factor
a
very
interesting
beer
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
nose
i
thought
this
would
be
more
along
the
lines
of
a
gueze
aroma
is
of
yeast
malt
brown
sugar
and
barnyard
full
tangy
body
taste
is
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
and
sour
grapes
this
brew
could
be
a
good
substitute
for
champaign
well
balanced
with
an
apricot
fruit
flavor
up
front
and
a
light
tartness
on
the
finish
which
offers
a
decent
feel
and
a
slowly
drying
finish
with
a
hint
of
spice
quite
pleasant
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
sour
yet
not
too
intriguing
either
nice
drinking
beer
could
benefit
from
being
two
notches
drier
imo
but
very
good
beer
this
is
a
great
everyday
sour
beer
especially
because
of
the
price
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
dechutes
dissident
but
lower
in
abv
and
not
quite
as
fruity
but
a
great
alternative
definitely
has
some
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
but
it
also
has
some
spicy
malts
pours
a
clear
amber
with
small
bubbles
very
slight
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
bready
with
a
little
sour
mixed
in
the
beer
tastes
to
me
like
a
mix
of
licorice
herbal
a
little
cola
and
a
little
sour
lots
of
candy
sugar
flavor
mouth
feel
is
a
little
to
viscous
for
me
want
something
a
little
more
crisp
over
all
i
want
to
try
another
faro
but
this
is
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
dryer
and
a
little
more
tartness
would
do
it
for
me
d
the
candy
sweetness
is
a
big
part
of
the
beer
with
brett
and
lambic
characters
just
peaking
through
the
background
the
minty
character
is
interesting
and
works
with
the
tartness
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
kept
sipping
hoping
more
of
the
funk
would
arise
d
not
the
greatest
for
me
just
because
its
so
sweet
this
isnt
a
style
that
id
be
interested
in
trying
out
i
want
my
lambics
and
sours
to
be
tart
dry
and
funk
filled
pours
a

with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet

tart
malt
acidity

general
sweetness
overall
a
good
sweetened
lambic
overall
it
is
a
beer
that
i
have
to
be
in
the
mode
to
drink
i
think
it
could
be
drinkable
in
the
right
time
and
place
i
have
to
give
it
a
good
score
here
as
i
do
like
it
i
drank
about
half
the
bottle
then
it
became
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
so
i
sparked
a
big
ass
cigar
and
dam
if
it
didnt
work
well
with
it
d
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
what
i
get
when
i
do
not
like
the
sweetness
i
taste
the
cuvee
rene
in
this
and
want
that
i
could
see
why
people
like
this
but
this
is
not
for
me
d
this
is
my
1st
lambic
i
have
been
very
hesitant
to
try
this
style
of
beer
but
it
is
very
refreshing
and
different
i
think
i
could
try
other
lambics
but
no
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
this
may
be
a
good
starting
beer
for
ladies
who
like
leinenkugels
berry
weiss
or
perhaps
a
wine
cooler
d
i
mean
who
doesnt
like
sugar
i
know
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
sweet
and
of
course
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
think
lindemans
didnt
take
a
few
creative
liberties
a
put
their
own
touch
on
the
style
i
would
actually
almost
probably
buy
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
dessert
and
now
i
really
want
to
try
some
other
beers
in
this
style
i
just
hope
they
dont
all
give
me
diabetes
drinkability
this
went
down
quickly
and
was
nicely
refreshing
enjoyable
appears
a
deep
apple
juice
like
amber
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
that
dwindles
rather
quickly
not
as
effervescent
as
the
other
fruit
lambics
that
lindemans
makes
aroma
tart
fruit
notes
hints
of
green
apple
acidity
and
barrel
aging
undertones
nice
pleasant
flow
in
the
nose
i
like
it
so
far
lets
taste
super
sweet
compared
to
most
traditional
lambics
its
actually
cider
sweet
hints
of
barrel
aging
touch
of
woody
tones
more
apple
like
sweetness
even
though
i
know
theres
no
fruit
added
to
this
one
just
belgian
candi
sugar
nice
underlying
acidic
notes
but
again
its
overall
really
sweet
dessert
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
a
bit
of
residual
sugars
nice
tart
middle
with
a
sweet
coating
finish
mellow
carbonation
going
on
drinkability
is
decent
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
on
the
sweeter
side
i
finished
this
beer
in
no
time
and
was
happy
to
do
so
although
id
like
a
little
bit
more
sourness
as
this
was
on
the
sweet
side
this
beer
was
pretty
refreshing
as
it
is
d
at
8
this
is
a
single
buy
for
me
to
try
the
style
its
the
only
one
around
but
it
was
a
lot
like
drinking
a
lambic
soda
a
sure
fire
crowd
pleaser
though
clear
amber
with
a
dense
white
head
that
settles
into
a
thin
cap
leaving
some
lace
this
beer
looks
good
the
nose
belies
this
beers
lambic
base
a
mild
musty
funk
and
woody
aroma
are
immediately
noticeable
but
as
this
warms
up
i
do
get
a
rather
noticeable
sweetness
sugary
and
rather
intense
like
cake
frosting
this
aspect
isnt
particularly
enjoyable
it
is
however
better
than
the
taste
wretched
candy
sweetness
this
tastes
like
sugar
water
the
sourness
and
funk
are
completely
overwhelmed
here
this
is
like
cheap
store
brand
soda
with
an
artificial
fruit
and
sugary
sweetness
and
the
carbonation
lending
a
refreshing
finale
to
this
beer
i
really
dont
get
much
flavor
here
this
is
just
rather
wretched
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
regular
and
brown
sugar
avoid
pours
a
murky
ruddy
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
fades
nose
is
pretty
good
with
some
nice
tart
and
funky
notes
some
lemon
as
well
taste
however
falls
a
little
flat
it
tastes
pretty
much
exactly
like
the
description
of
a
faroa
geueze
with
sugar
added
its
sweet
has
lemon
and
malty
notes
as
well
as
an
almost
tealike
note
moderate
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
ok
though
not
something
i
will
revisit
this
is
really
worth
a
try
even
if
you
pick
it
up
just
to
bring
it
to
a
christmas
party
this
is
worth
a
pour
for
yourself
this
seems
like
it
would
be
enjoyed
by
most
people
craft
fans
or
not
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
faro
beers
d
a

sipper
d
overall

drinking
for
sure
nothing
thats
gonna
wow
you

wise
but
tasty

one
wont

i
just

if
lindemans
did
some
artificial

as

as
the
candied
sugar
after
all
they
do
it
with
their
standard
series

so
it
certainly
isnt
out

the
question
also
for

i
have

a

sweet
with
tart
candied
citrus
caramel
pine
resin
light
body
and
carbonation
first
faro
for
me
not
a
fan
too
sweet
and
syrup
like
cant
really
judge
it
for
the
style
o
this
beer
is
sweet
but
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
so
it
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
it
tastes
like
a
sweetened
lambic
without
that
much
in
the
way
of
fruity
flavors
ov
this
is
the
second
faro
lambic
lindemans
being
the
other
ive
had
and
ive
enjoyed
them
both
this
is
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
sour
the
flavours
blend
well
together
though
none
of
them
are
bold
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
like
i
said
beers
like
this
tend
to
be
polarizing
and
im
glad
to
be
on
the
side
that
can
appreciate
this
beer
poured
from
a
350
ml
bottle
into
a
fluted
glass
this
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
small
fizzy
extremely
short
lived
off
white
head
only
a
few
seconds
perhaps
the
shortest
lived
ive
ever
seen
it
smells
of
vinegar
funk
and
a
little
sugar
malts
the
feel
is
thinish
the
taste
is
okay
you
get
some
funk
sour
notes
vinegar
with
a
load
of
sugar
to
combat
everything
but
way
too
sweet
beer
is
light
to
lightmedium
in
body
with
minimal
carbonation
a
bit
watery
resulting
in
the
beer
moving
fairly
slowly
but
still
enjoyably
so
on
the
palate
finish
is
expectedly
dry
from
sugar
and
acids
probably
a
good
accompaniment
to
any
fruit
pie
but
i
enjoyed
it
all
by
itself
as
well
ill
be
back
for
more
of
this
i
have
such
a
headache
o
this
is
my
first
faro
and
its
not
bad
a
little
too
sweet
but
it
has
good
flavor
i
would
for
sure
try
other
faros
but
i
may
not
try
this
one
again
o
i
like
this
a
bit
better
than
soda
pop
but
it
is
in
the
same
camp
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
to
much
after
half
a
glass
but
it
is
still
a
bit
softer
than
other
faros
i
have
had
my
wife
who
only
drinks
diet
coke
enjoyed
this
beer
fail
it
is
sweet
but
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
drinkable
you
just
have
to
be
ready
for
it
d
to
me
faro
is
the
stepping
stone
between
fruity
lambics
and
the
good
stuff
i
think
this
falls
into
that
category
but
just
barely
its
sweet
but
not
overwhelmingly
saccharine
and
the
tartness
helps
that
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
dig
the
flavor
here
apart
from
that
i
think
the
beer
is
just
above
average
overall
this
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
lambics
as
this
one
seems
to
be
rated
quite
a
bit
lower
notes
possibly
the
most
unique
beer
ive
had
to
date
faro
numero
dos
whoda
thunk
it
eh
w0rd
it
pours
a
clear
tawny
amber
topped
by
a
fleeting
halffinger
of
glowing
offwhit
foam
the
nose
comprises
funky
oak
light
sour
cherries
rum
raisin
cake
dank
greens
brown
sugar
and
light
white
vinegar
sweet
and
sour
sauce
aint
got
shit
on
this
what
the
taste
does
away
with
most
of
the
sour
notes
though
some
very
subtle
vinegar
and
tart
black
cherries
remain
fairly
unfazed
the
grand
coalition
though
is
composed
of
the
brown
sugar
cinnamon
raisins
maple
syrup
and
candi
sugar
the
body
is
a
smooth
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sticky
finish
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
here
but
this
was
overtly
drinkable
i
want
more
this
beer
pours
a
deep
orangish
amber
hue
with
no
head
the
smell
is
of
oak
rum
raisin
bit
of
vinegar
and
cheddar
cheese
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
white
grape
some
oak
flavor
and
raisin
without
the
rum
the
taste
isnt
foul
but
its
kinda
weak
in
my
opinion
has
a
nice
light
champagne
feel
to
the
palate
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
bad
for
something
that
i
thought
i
wouldnt
like
though
overall
it
by
style
is
still
more
wine
like
than
beer
interesting
but
tough
to
drink
d
this
beer
could
have
actually
been
pretty
decent
if
it
wasnt
for
the
chemical
nature
of
it
the
beer
is
mostly
clear
and
seethrough
with
small
chunks
of
sediment
wandering
aimlessly
throughout
the
beer
the
color
is
a
light
orange
sunburst
the
beer
has
a
small
head
that
leaves
just
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
like
a
fruit
juice
the
beer
tastes
very
sweet
though
i
suppose
this
was
the
intention
personally
i
cant
fathom
why
one
would
take
a
sour
beer
and
intentionally
make
it
sweeter
to
each
their
own
surprisingly
the
sweetness
is
not
as
cloying
as
i
predicted
the
body
is
mediumthin
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
it
was
a
fun
experience
but
i
much
prefer
the
traditional
lambics
over
faros
from
an
objective
standpoint
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
said
this
about
the
lindemanns
faro
and
its
about
the
same
for
this
it
tastes
a
little
like
apple
juice
its
sweet
and
fruity
its
not
cloying
but
it
does
taste
kind
of
like
fruit
juice
beer
is
thin
and
has
almost
no
carbonation
in
the
mouth
it
tastes
fine
its
just
sweet
and
nothing
else
kind
of
boring
im
sure
this
is
what
this
beer
is
suppose
to
taste
like
but
its
just
not
that
great
ill
keep
trying
faros
as
possible
as
that
will
be
but
the
two
ive
had
so
far
have
been
rather
unimpressive
i
would
however
try
this
again
if
it
were
on
draft
somewhere
tasted
from
bottle
purchased
at
binnys
lincoln
park
pours
a
muddy
brownorange
with
an
average
white
head
that
recedes
to
decent
lace
nose
of
nutty
brown
sugar
with
some
funk
and
a
smell
similar
to
rye
bread
flavor
is
caramel
with
some
toastiness
light
funk
moderate
sour
flavors
and
nuttiness
body
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
and
a
short
sour
and
nutty
finish
very
very
blunt
this
one
is
the
aroma
on
this
one
is
definitely
a
bit
objectionable
because
of
the
excessive
sweetness
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
bad
but
it
is
not
something
i
really
want
to
try
again
drinability
is
good
seems
to
be
meant
to
be
sipped
and
as
that
it
drinks
well
d
fairly
drinkable
due
to
the
light
flavor
and
lack
of
intense
sourness
although
it
is
held
back
by
the
sugar
intensity
d
this
brew
is
easy
enough
to
drink
actually
due
to
its
juicesoda
similarities
but
it
doesnt
taste
very
good
so
why
bother
as
soon
as
i
realized
it
was
notsogood
i
just
downed
the
whole
bottle
like
i
was
shotgunning
a
keystone
light
on
to
the
next
drastically
better
brew

poured

and
no

aroma
of
syrup
and
sugar
is
somewhat
gross
with
light
oak
notes
and
no

taste
is
also
dominated
by
gross
sugar
and
syrup
with
limited
complexity
from
the
oak
or
the
base
lambic
body
is
full
with
minimal
complexity
and
a
minimal
carbonation
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
smell
is
a
bit
funky
with
vinegar
tones
and
a
little
bit
of
sugar
the
taste
is
initially
very
sweet
tart
and
funky
medium
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
interesting
beer
although
an
interesting
beer
i
doubt
i
will
try
too
many
more
faros
due
to
limited
availability
but
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
d
one
and
done
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
its
just
way
too
sweet
glad
to
say
that
ive
gotten
the
chance
to
try
a
faro
pours
an
unattractive
brownish
orange
color
with
no
head
garbage
juice
was
a
common
description
of
the
aroma
at
the
tasting
where
this
beer
was
had
garbage
juice
and
herbal
bitters
maybe
some
hobo
oddly
intriguing
nonetheless
flavor
is
sugary
fruit
punch
with
only
a
hint
of
the
gross
herbal
note
from
the
aroma
why
overall
very
different
never
had
this
style
before
so
cant
bash
it
too
bad
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
my
tastes
also
some
very
strange
tastes
and
smells
really
had
to
reach
into
my
memories
to
figure
these
out
drinkability
was
impressive
this
is
a
super
refreshing
flavorful
and
easydrinking
lambic
it
is
far
more
complex
and
far
less
cloying
than
many
of
the
other
sweetened
versions
on
the
market
i
could
imagine
this
making
for
a
terrific
afterdinner
drink
drinkability
is
decent
much
too
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
soft
on
the
palate
but
finishes
with
a
candylike
sweetness
decent
but
not
drinkable
oh
yum
whatever
trepidation
i
had
with
the
aroma
vanished
the
instant
i
tasted
this
delicious
concoction
sweet
belgian
candy
and
a
light
almost
gingerlike
spice
sits
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
quickly
giving
way
to
caramelsugary
goodness
and
a
strange
almost
salty
note
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
light
with
an
almost
syrupy
viscosity
from
the
sugars
definitely
a
beer
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
this
reminds
me
of
the
lambics
made
by
lindemans
fun
to
try
and
recommended
but
probably
not
a
repeat
for
me
i
didnt
find
chapeau
faro
to
be
terribly
complex
but
what
i
did
find
a
very
sweet
interesting
beer
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
overall
god
awful
way
too
sweet
with
no
other
redeeming
flavors
now
i
know
why
there
are
only
13
of
these
in
the
database
cant
be
much
demand
for
it
avoid
and
definitely
one
and
done
but
at
least
i
got
faro
off
the
list
d
a
bit
tough
to
decipher
at
first
challenging
to
decide
whether
this
is
sweet
or
tart
or
something
else
after
a
few
sips
it
really
grew
on
me
refreshing
easy
enough
to
drink
and
certainly
curious
id
have
this
again
its
too
bad
its
a
style
so
hard
to
find
big
thanks
deniz
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
zywiec
stange
pours
a
nice
brown
color
like
most
brown
ales
do
the
smell
is
good
that
of
candied
sugar
and
the
slightest
hint
of
horse
blanket
the
taste
i
wish
i
could
say
was
better
than
it
is
kind
of
like
an
apple
cider
but
with
a
little
bit
of
brett
shining
through
in
the
finish
along
with
candied
sugar
not
bad
just
wish
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
it
is
my
first
shot
at
the
style
and
think
the
artifical
sweetness
in
the
front
taste
may
be
typical
to
this
brewery
for
their
banana
lambic
was
cloyingly
sweet
in
an
artificial
way
when
i
had
it
a
while
back
the
mouthfeel
is
stickier
than
a
cider
however
more
like
a
soda
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
the
best
part
of
the
taste
is
the
finish
it
loses
points
drinkability
wise
because
of
the
sweetness
i
would
like
to
try
other
examples
of
this
style
however
i
would
rather
have
a
nice
gueze
to
drink
instead
pours
out
the
haziest
brown
color
ive
seen
almost
some
ruby
highlights
in
there
but
its
almost
too
hazy
to
let
any
light
through
the
head
was
thin
from
the
start
offwhite
colored
leaving
no
lacing
this
is
my
first
in
the
style
and
i
imagine
it
could
be
better
i
mean
ive
seen
plenty
of
lambics
that
look
clearer
still
hazy
of
course
but
they
let
light
through
and
nicer
looks
kind
of
like
an
actively
fermenting
beer
without
the
krausen
the
smell
is
wonderful
reminds
me
of
the
best
lambics
and
sours
ive
smelled
a
bit
fruity
and
sugary
with
a
huge
sour
smell
not
too
acidic
in
the
nose
a
bit
vinegar
kind
of
powdery
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sour
candy
but
smells
light
and
crisp
the
taste
is
really
great
theres
immediately
the
flavor
of
apple
cider
which
this
kind
of
looks
like
then
comes
the
sour
theres
a
delightful
tartness
playing
with
the
sweetness
but
i
keep
coming
back
to
apples
kind
of
onedimensional
which
makes
it
a
bit
less
interesting
to
drink
but
im
a
fan
of
the
sour
i
could
see
this
being
a
beer
you
drink
for
an
extended
session
but
i
can
imagine
that
the
sweetness
would
get
cloying
after
a
while
just
a
bit
more
sourtart
and
a
bit
of
lightness
would
actually
help
the
carbonation
is
lightly
present
nice
and
the
wild
yeasts
keep
this
one
nice
and
full
the
sweetness
helps
too
easy
to
drink
i
mean
it
pours
down
like
a
na
drink
but
the
sweetness
will
probably
hurt
it
in
the
long
run
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
i
had
some
initial
doubts
due
to
the
strong
vinegary
nose
right
out
of
the
bottle
things
quickly
settled
down
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
well
carbonated
murky
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
a
touch
of
lacing
some
head
retention
the
nose
started
out
pretty
questionable
i
thought
my
bottle
had
gone
bad
it
got
better
once
the
beer
had
a
chance
to
aerate
the
taste
was
a
real
treat
this
beer
is
a
close
cousin
to
a
belgian
flemish
sour
red
style
ale
the
beer
has
that
unique
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
tastes
a
wooden
perhaps
slightly
oaken
aged
tartness
and
some
very
light
sherry
qualities
the
beer
is
sweet
though
much
sweeter
than
a
flemish
red
ale
there
are
pear
flavors
maybe
some
peach
maybe
some
other
combinations
of
sweet
dessert
type
fruits
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
nice
character
and
loads
of
complexity
it
was
a
real
treat
just
dont
let
the
nose
turn
you
off
drink
on
mildly
effervescent
and
very
smooth
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
though
with
a
sour
and
woody
balance
but
not
too
sticky
a
candyish
treat
moderate
alcohol
for
a
belgian
and
with
a
nice
taste
this
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
this
what
a
faros
like
i
dont
know
its
not
terribly
drinkable
but
i
cant
say
for
sure
if
thats
standard
as
its
the
only
one
ive
ever
had
cant
say
i
was
a
huge
fan
on
the
whole
though
the
tastes
and
aromas
were
just
too
whack
m
d
a
little
bite
of
carbonation
over
a
medium
body
i
quite
enjoyed
the
flavour
myself
though
i
could
see
it
as
being
a
lovehate
type
of
thing
i
would
perhaps
be
a
little
more
satisfied
with
a
bigger
tartness
not
bad
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
sour
or
funky
as
the
nose
its
lightly
funky
lightly
sour
and
moderately
sweet
mmm
its
good
nice
balance
theres
some
malt
behind
the
sweetness
but
not
a
lot
spotlight
is
definitely
on
the
yeastiness
overall
flavor
magnitude
is
similar
to
a
soda
not
loud
and
boisterous
like
some
lambics
ive
tried
its
rather
soft
and
delicate
especially
the
sweetness
mild
chocolate
and
nut
notes
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
finishes
fairly
clean
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
soft
mouthcoating
tastes
good
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
smooth
almost
slick
quality
to
it
and
mellow
carbonation
it
goes
down
easily
enough
however
i
personally
am
not
a
fan
of
the
overbearing
sweetness
that
pervades
this
brew
i
need
to
try
more
faros
before
writing
off
the
style
however
of
this
one
i
can
say
i
am
not
a
fan

would
prevent
me
from
finishing
a
bottle
of
this
and
for
that
reason
i
doubt
i
would
have
it
again
however
the
flavours
were
very
interesting
and
the
weird
funkiness
was
quite
unique
im
glad
i
had
the
experience
and
it
really
opens
your
eyes
to
how
much
variation
there
is
in
the
world
of
beer
poured
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
raisin
brown
with
almost
no
head
even
with
a
very
vigorous
pour
and
since
no
head
can
be
disturbed
no
lacing
occurred
either
the
strange
thing
is
if
you
swirl
the
glass
a
nice
ring
of
small
bubbles
breaks
the
surface
of
the
beer
but
it
never
forms
a
head
the
aroma
is
so
tart
that
it
makes
the
back
of
your
jaw
sting
this
has
a
really
nice
sourtartfunky
aroma
with
green
apples
grape
skins
and
almost
a
dry
merlot
aroma
the
flavor
is
the
strangest
flavor
dichotomy
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
it
starts
out
with
a
green
applegrape
skin
sourness
and
then
completely
melts
into
a
big
raisin
sweetness
that
reminds
me
quite
intensely
of
the
flavor
of
a
quad
its
really
strange
i
would
really
like
to
know
how
they
come
about
with
such
a
strange
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
syrupy
with
not
much
carbonation
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
mouthfeel
of
a
kvass
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
every
6
months
or
so
but
i
dont
even
think
that
i
could
even
drink
one
of
these
every
week
this
would
fall
more
into
the
oddity
column
then
the
regular
column
intensely
sweet
at
the
start
like
a
concentrated
apple
cider
sugar
burnt
sugar
apples
and
more
sugar
give
way
to
a
slightly
woody
oaky
balsamic
finish
has
a
fairly
light
feel
but
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
overbearing
a
little
more
balance
would
go
a
long
way
but
this
is
a
not
unpleasant
drink
for
dessert
bottle
thanks
to
mmmbeer
my
first
faro
pours
a
ruby
hue
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
tons
of
i
guess
you
would
call
this
fruity
notes
somewhat
woody
and
sour
very
pungent
for
sure
the
flavor
is
also
nice
sweet
sugary
fruity
flavors
combined
with
a
woody
sourness
some
sweet
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
woody
flavor
very
odd
a
tart
cherry
unripe
fruit
flavor
but
also
lots
of
sweetness
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
very
interesting
and
nice
easygoing
and
yet
it
made
an
impact
on
me
ehh
give
me
a
real
lambic
anyday
this
just
tastes
like
a
sweet
soda
drink
and
at
7
i
wont
be
going
back
to
it
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
on
this
one
each
element
of
this
offering
may
not
be
spectacular
but
it
makes
for
an
enjoyable
effort
to
savor
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
while
its
not
one
that
i
could
really
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
its
a
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
d
well
i
enjoyed
it
but
if
you
dont
like
a
sweet
beer
you
probably
wont
all
in
all
i
dont
find
this
too
substantively
different
from
a
sweeter
flanders
red
its
like
a
lessvinegary
duchesse
very
easy
to
drink
again
if
you
dont
mind
a
sweeter
beer
at
4
5
you
could
drink
it
until
your
sweet
tooth
gave
out
this
was
a
drain
pour
the
first
one
in
a
while
i
could
not
even
finish
the
glass
not
reccomended
at
all
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
grapevine
travelers
in
my
home
town
this
will
be
my
first
time
trying
an
example
of
this
belgian
beer
cork
came
off
without
much
of
a
pop
and
poured
a
nice
looking
burgundy
with
a
ring
of
white
lace
red
wine
vinegar
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
in
the
nose
followed
cherries
and
raspberries
taste
is
exceedingly
sweet
with
a
tiny
bit
of
funky
sourness
again
raspberries
and
cherries
come
to
mind
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
pretty
good
although
some
might
be
a
little
turned
off
by
the
sweetness
factor
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
almost
reminded
me
of
a
flanders
red
ale
and
also
showed
some
oud
bruin
character
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
a
faro
and
will
hopefully
try
a
few
more
in
the
future

thanks
deniz
my
first
faro
the
ever
elusive
faro
i
thought
it
would
take
me
forever
to
get
one
of
these
well
it
did
but
lb4lb
got
me
one
now
to
the
review
aroma
has
a
very
tart
sugary
aroma
to
it
at
first
with
some
subtle
malts
cherries
and
sour
candy
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
that
lingers
around
for
a
while
taste
is
a
lot
of
sugar
that
comes
right
up
to
and
smacks
you
in
the
face
wow
still
tastes
like
sour
candy
and
some
lemon
mixed
in
there
as
well
on
the
back
end
a
little
bit
of
roastiness
i
have
to
agree
with
the
reviewer
below
me
its
like
a
mouth
full
of
table
sugar
if
this
is
indicative
of
all
faros
then
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
them
overall
way
too
sweet
glad
the
lb4lb
got
it
to
me
but
i
guess
its
just
not
my
style
thx

slowly

to
nothing
after
a

not
to
mention
the
very
tiny

in
th
beer
the
aroma
is
a
funky
sweet
brown
sugar
and
medium

the
taste
is
like
a
fruitless
fruit
lambic
youe
get
all
the
swetness
just
none
of
the
real
distinct
fruit
flavors
you
get
lots
of
candi

and
brown
sugar
withcurrant
like
tartness
not
a
bad
after
dinner
beer
lots
of
dark
toasted
malty
goodness
overall
only
the
second
faro
ive
ever
had
so
im
far
from
an
expert
this
one
was
enjoyable
but
simple
to
wet
my
appetite
however
a
nice
beer
faro
isnt
such
an
exotic
style
after
all
its
simply
a
style
that
few
brewers
choose
to
brew
if
you
arent
a
lambic
snob
and
actually
like
the
sweet
fruit
lambics
on
occasion
chapeau
faro
lambic
is
worth
a
purchase
drinkability
i
believe
this
is
my
first
faro
although
if
the
patent
awfulness
of
the
rest
of
these
chapeau
beers
is
any
indiction
whatsoever
it
wasnt
much
of
a
faro
at
all
avoid
i
would
definately
only
drink
this
on
rare
occasions
because
of
how
intensly
sweet
it
is
but
i
will
definately
be
back
for
round
two
eventually
taste
is
fairly
rich
and
balanced
between
the
vinegar
and
sugar
kind
of
appley
but
more
in
the
tart
red
variety
wheat
malt
is
prevalent
and
aids
in
the
creamy
mouthfeel
prickly
carbonation
keeps
this
one
moving
a
little
cloying
at
times
but
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
interesting
beer

the

also
a

on

the

is
sweet
up

but
also
is
rounded
out
nicely
by
the
acidic
taste
not
as
sweet
as
other
faros
that
i
have
had

of

i
was
getting
with

that

very

able
i
havent
had
enough
faros
to
know
how
this
compares
but
it
was
okay
though
it
lacks
any
complexity
or
really
interesting
character
most
likely
wont
return
to
this
one
a

sweeter

from

very
overall
bit

hard
to

from
other

if
not
for
the
telling
sweetness
doesnt
have
the
dimension
of
puckering
tartness
or
complexity
in
aroma
largely
though
this
isnt
that
much
worse
i
enjoyed
it
this
rare
style
wow
this
one
was
a
surprise
this
is
my
first
faro
so
take
that
into
consideration
on
the
review
i
had
this
one
out
of
a
corked
and
capped
bottle
about
the
size
of
a
standard
16oz
beer
the
name
and
company
are
correct
but
it
had
a
different
label
than
posted
here
i
poured
it
into
a
lindemans
lambic
glass
it
is
a
strawgolden
color
with
a
good
rocky
white
head
that
fades
at
a
moderately
slow
pace
lots
of
carbonation
rising
up
the
glass
there
is
pronounced
sediment
in
this
lambic
which
isnt
a
turnoff
to
me
the
smell
is
a
musty
spicy
and
sweet
but
light
not
cloying
the
taste
was
the
surprise
sort
of
like
a
lightly
sweet
and
highly
carbonated
ginger
ale
it
really
gives
me
a
pleasant
feeling
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
deus
de
flanders
but
not
quite
as
complex
the
sediment
was
even
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
medium
if
it
were
not
so
expensive
id
drink
this
regularly
sampled
alongside
lindemans
faro
the
front
label
had
3
5
abv
but
the
back
label
had
4
75
chapeaus
label
is
green
brown
with
a
picture
of
a
beer
barrel
draped
with
hops
and
barley
lindemans
is
much
more
attractive
all
black
with
stylish
art
deco
white
lettering
on
opening
the
lindemans
had
more
fizz
and
an
immediate
strong
plummy
aroma
both
settle
to
a
brown
copper
colour
with
a
fringe
of
bubbly
froth
the
lindemans
bubbles
slightly
larger
and
more
varied
so
far
the
lindemans
is
ahead
on
giving
both
a
good
sniff
the
chapeau
edges
ahead
with
its
musty
sweet
aroma
slightly
medicinal
slightly
licorice
quite
perfumey
parma
violets
when
swirled
extra
sweetness
rises
the
lindemans
has
a
slight
plum
aroma
when
swirled
some
yeasty
lambic
acid
rises
on
tasting
the
chapeau
is
the
more
interesting
with
its
sweet
and
medicinal
taste
followed
by
a
soft
sweet
licorice
flavour
at
the
back
however
it
flags
slightly
when
the
band
aid
remains
in
the
mouth
along
with
a
cloying
clinging
sweey
coating
of
the
mouth
the
lindemans
is
much
simpler
and
more
direct
it
is
intensely
sweet
initially
but
that
soon
settles
into
a
balance
between
sweetness
and
acidity
the
mouthfeel
really
pushes
the
lindemans
into
first
place
chapeau
has
a
soft
mouthfeel
with
a
barely
noticable
and
soon
gone
gentle
fizz
quite
boring
the
lindemans
however
has
a
soft
fizzy
mothfeel
very
gentle
like
having
baby
rabbits
tickle
your
mouth
weee
the
conclusion
is
that
chapeau
is
a
flavoursome
and
interesting
drink
but
lacks
the
fun
of
lindemans
despite
the
fuller
and
more
complex
flavours
overall
i
had
this
for
dessert
and
i
think
thats
the
perfect
time
for
this
one
i
couldnt
see
myself
enjoying
it
as
much
on
a
camping
trip
morning
or
after
some
exercise
the
taste
has
an
initial
tart
kick
with
an
overall
green
apple
sweetness
the
sweetness
is
pretty
overpowering
and
really
leads
to
a
cloying
overly
sweet
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
one
tough
to
drink
overall
goes
down
easy
but
teh
sock
background
flavor
becomes
mroe
pronounced
the
more
you
drink
and
the
more
the
beer
warms
by
the
second
bottle
i
had
had
enough
it
is
not
overly
complex
but
a
very
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
makes
it
quite
drinkable
this
was
a
250ml
bottle
that
i
got
at
delirium
café
while
on
my
faro
kick
in
belgium
they
are
definitely
a
great
style
but
very
difficult
to
find
stateside
this
particular
beer
has
a
dark
amber
color
but
is
very
clear
it
initially
has
a
good
head
but
it
falls
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
but
with
that
typical
gueuze
sourness
in
the
background
i
really
like
the
contrast
between
the
two
aromas
the
taste
is
sweet
on
the
tongue
while
simultaneously
sour
on
the
glands
in
my
neck
causing
them
to
tingle
there
is
also
an
appley
flavor
hidden
in
there
giving
this
an
almost
cidery
feel
as
with
the
aroma
the
contrast
between
the
two
flavors
is
great
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
all
around
and
although
not
the
best
faro
i
had
a
very
good
beer
bottle
poured
a
clear
medium
orangey
color
faro
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
quite
good
retention
aroma
of
sugar
with
some
tart
and
sourness
taste
is
quite
sweet
which
is
kind
of
expected
for
faro
with
more
tart
and
sourness
and
overall
complexity
then
expected
from
this
brewery
overall
this
was
better
then
expected
since
this
brewer
is
not
know
for
following
the
traditional
lambic
way
the
only
bottled
faro
i
have
had
was
lindemans
and
it
was
far
more
balanced
that
this
iirc
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
would
probably
recommend
a
bottle
of
this
over
the
lindemans
faro
which
i
have
also
had
but
in
belgium
overall
a
nice
faro
but
nothing
very
special
it
is
worth
to
try
it
though
lots
of
diacetyl
could
have
just
been
an
off
batch
the
beer
is
copper
to
amber
in
color
and
mildly
hazy
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sugary
with
some
malt
yeast
and
lambic
scents
lingering
in
the
background
smells
true
to
style
sugary
and
sweet
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
in
a
session
light
and
refreshing
with
some
fruity
malt
character
hints
of
tartness
and
yeast
its
true
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
much
prefer
traditional
lambic
but
this
is
well
done
for
what
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
have
the
opportunity
o
a
decent
beer
and
fun
to
try
but
again
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
very
enjoyable
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
cantillon
faro
we
had
later
on
though
of
course
each
one
varied
from
batch
to
batch
throughout
the
trip
o
very
very
good
beer
o
probably
the
best
faro
out
there
this
is
really
the
best
example
of
a
faro
that
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
perfect
pre
and
during
dinner
drink
and
i
am
incredibly
impressed
with
how
appetizing
and
very
good
this
beer
ended
up
being
d
nice
one
could
have
better
body
drinkability
great
this
is
just
a
nice
mild
and
easily
sessionable
beer
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
it
again
in
large
quantities
d
well
i
dont
usually
find
styles
similar
to
this
one
too
drinkable
but
with
how
good
this
was
i
found
myself
wanting
more
great
beer
overall
sampled
on
tap
at
the
drie
fonteinen
restaurant
with
lunch
what
a
wonderful
find
as
the
style
is
hard
to
find
and
on
tap
ever
more
so
beer
was
served
with
a
copper
color
and
just
the
slightest
amount
of
bubbles
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
but
there
was
no
carbonation
at
all
on
this
one
which
is
due
to
the
fact
of
how
it
is
served
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
some
slight
acidic
notes
as
well
taste
was
sweet
but
not
overpowering
refreshing
and
just
a
hint
of
tart
but
sweet
was
the
overall
tone
of
this
beer
and
made
for
a
great
lunch

from
the
375
ml
bottle
purchased
at
best
damn
beer
shop
in
san
diego
price
was
an
eyewatering
15
bucks
but
thats
the
price
you
pay
for
fermentation
spontanée
faro
is
a
pretty
obscure
style
and
this
is
only
the
second
one
ive
had
aside
from
lindemans
this
is
by
far
for
myself
much
more
enjoyable
and
not
as
sweet
i
find
this
much
easier
to
drink
extremely
light
and
refreshing
and
i
like
its
mild
sweetness
not
sure
if
its
from
sucrose
but
the
cinnamon
angle
on
this
is
really
nice
pours
sort
of
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
as
anticipated
very
sweet
quite
fruity
with
an
interesting
butterscotch
note
to
it
as
well
decently
funky
with
some
must
oak
and
straw
lightly
tart
with
a
lemonlactic
note
the
flavor
has
the
same
interesting
combination
of
sweetness
and
tartness
a
bit
of
citrus
peel
along
with
candy
sugar
and
butterscotch
overall
its
as
if
the
flavors
were
there
once
but
have
fallen
off
its
totally
drinkable
but
theres
not
a
lot
there
ive
never
had
a
faro
so
its
tough
to
rate
to
style
i
doubt
ill
have
many
more
im
really
just
reviewing
this
to
taste
i
expect
more
because
the
flavors
that
are
there
make
me
expect
more
lambic
aspects
than
it
delivers
overall
this
is
a
nice
faro
it
has
some
nice
flavor
and
actually
isnt
overly
sweet
overall
this
isnt
a
very
good
beer
the
artificial
sweetener
flavor
is
off
putting
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
another
one
mediumbodied
with
slight
wateriness
around
the
edges
carbonation
is
modest
but
enough
to
propel
this
across
the
palate
resulting
feel
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
pour
is
a
deep
copper
color
with
tons
of
a
tight
bubbly
tan
head
the
nose
is
light
mostly
lambic
a
little
cob
web
like
fun
and
some
faint
caramel
and
brown
sugar
taste
follows
the
nose
but
a
slight
bit
sweeter
cobweb
and
dusty
funk
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
as
sweet
caramel
and
brown
sugars
come
in
the
body
is
light
with
a
very
active
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
hint
of
dryness
the
flavors
and
nose
are
a
bit
muted
but
it
does
offer
balance
and
some
depth
of
flavors
o
a
tasty
bottled
offering
of
faro
id
prefer
girardin
cut
the
crap
and
remove
the
acek
though
o
a
faro
isnt
the
easiest
style
to
like
but
this
isnt
so
far
out
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
i
guess
fados
really
arent
my
thing
still
decent
though
overall
great
beer
from
a
very
interesting
style
i
will
have
this
again

rare

craig
pours
clear
amber
with
low
level
of
carbonation
no
head
smells
like
caramel
oak
and
funk
little
bit
of
sourness
shines
through
and
quite
a
bit
more
bal
and
funk
than
i
was
expecting
some
haylike
scents
taste
is
actually
more
oaky
than
sweet
though
theres
plenty
of
sugar
to
even
out
the
sourness
and
tannins
wet
wood
caramel
bitterness
and
tannic
oak
in
the
finish
has
the
girardin
essence
just
very
sweet
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
decent
in
small
quantities
best
faro
ive
tasted
at
this
point
really
not
bad
bottle
pours
a
murky
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
more
funky
than
expected
and
has
a
slight
herbal
medicinal
note
the
taste
is
quite
a
surprise
and
reminds
me
of
sweet
peppermint
the
medicinal
notes
in
the
nose
are
slightly
present
in
the
taste
but
not
as
much
i
think
they
get
covered
up
by
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
very
easy
drinking
with
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
some
notes
of
cedar
or
wood
as
well
overall
i
somewhat
like
it
not
something
i
want
a
lot
of
but
it
was
great
to
try
this
one
pretty
unique
beer
is
moderately
dry
and
light
in
body
with
a
mild
forward
sweetness
and
some
lactic
and
acetic
notes
leading
up
to
a
clean
finish
its
got
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
drinkable
this
stuff
is
disgusting
and
tastes
like
diapers
much
more
funky
than
any
other
girardin
i
have
tasted
pour
is
brown
no
real
head
or
lacing
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
sweet
but
it
was
not
rubbery
and
a
bit
oxidized
definitely
a
yuck
factor
present
my
first
faro
but
i
cant
believe
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
grows
up
with
a
father
that
beats
them
constantly
in
a
trailer
park
and
winds
up
on
an
episode
of
cops
pours
a
pretty
light
amber
thats
clear
nose
is
cherry
butterscotch
faint
raspberry
with
that
lambic
funkiness
flavor
is
slightly
thin
with
apple
pear
a
touch
of
sweat
and
berry
sweetness
on
the
finish
with
some
nice
acidity
a
very
approachable
yet
respectable
lambic
i
found
it
difficult
to
finish
and
that
is
rare
with
me
so
not
the
best
faro
ive
had
d
this
is
pretty
easy
drinking
stuff
its
not
as
drinkable
as
classic
gueuze
due
to
the
sweetness
but
i
could
easily
put
back
a
375ml
bottle
d
the
split
of
this
bottle
helps
because
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
all
too
much
of
it
that
said
i
would
drink
again
but
doubt
ill
ever
see
it
again
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
lambic
with
mellow
flavors
and
a
restrained
tartness
due
to
the
sweetening
refreshing
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer

this
is
by
far
the
best
faro
i
ever
had
it
is
indeed
sweeter
than
the
original
1882
but
not
by
much
there
are
multiple
sour
acidic
notes
along
with
the
sweety
fruitiness
and
lots
of
earthiness
and
funkiness
a
very
impressive
example
high
drinkability
since
it
is
well
balanced
and
just
lightly
sweet
a
masterpiece
of
flavor
packed
in
such
a
low
abv
ive
enjoyed
all
of
the
girardin
lambics
ive
tried
but
their
faro
in
particular
seems
the
stand
out
offering
it
was
super
neat
and
a
little
unlike
the
couple
other
faros
ive
tried
it
had
an
untypical
amount
of
depth
for
the
style
a
touch
of
fruit
gumsswelling
level
of
sweet
sugar
and
a
mellow
jam
session
of
funk
this
is
something
i
might
have
to
seek
out
again
note
the
bubbling
part
looked
like
the
stuff
they
give
me
before
stomach
xrays
to
cear
the
stomach
it
did
it
may
be

i
have
not

bottle
poured
a
light
reddishbrown
color
lambic
with
a
big
foamy
offwhite
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
is
quite
funky
with
limited
tartness
and
acidity
which
was
a
bit
disappointing
taste
was
similar
to
the
gueuze
but
as
if
the
tartness
and
acidity
had
been
removed
and
replace
with
light
sugary
notes
body
was
a
bit
too
light
with
some
good
carbonation
i
find
it
always
interesting
too
try
those
traditional
examples
but
this
one
really
miss
the
mark
drinkability
is
great
not
overly
sweet
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
nice
refreshing
drink
on
a
warm
august
day
i
really
liked
this
one
the
best
of
the
three
girardin
beers
we
sampled
this
is
a
weird
style
and
ive
got
nothing
to
really
compare
it
against
im
going
by
my
overall
impressions
of
this
brew
im
flabbergasted
i
have
troubles
finding
the
correct
words
lets
keep
it
to
superb
expectations
valorised
this
could
be
an
intriguing
blend
but
i
fear
that
i
overaged
it
with
a
few
years
in
the
cellar
cork
says
ref
bx
2010
but
that
might
not
be
a
date
because
ive
had
the
bottle
at
least
that
long
and
i
suspect
longer
started
with
an
attractive
pour
of
a
smokey
amber
color
translucent
but
not
clear
with
a
surprising
layer
of
fine
cream
head
and
little
sediment
just
a
bit
of
basement
woodworking
shop
in
the
nose
with
caramel
toast
coffee
flavor
is
of
caramel
of
course
but
with
bitterness
close
behind
and
a
lick
of
sourness
somewhere
in
the
chorus
some
apple
and
some
of
the
pie
spices
to
go
with
not
that
much
of
any
of
them
though
surely
flattened
by
age
still
feels
like
a
good
cleansing
drink
a
bit
thin
a
bit
of
oil
but
a
pleasant
feel
i
hope
its
not
too
much
of
a
disservice
to
taste
and
old
bottle
like
dragging
the
model
out
of
bed
without
hairdo
and
makeup
but
theres
character
and
uniqueness
here
but
i
need
a
better
example
to
judge
on
the
execution
this
beer
is
delicate
and
flavorful
as
this
is
a
particularly
hard
style
for
me
to
drink
let
alone
enjoy
i
am
particularly
impressed
it
does
pair
rather
beautifully
with
a
gruyere
i
have
on
hand
and
i
imagine
it
would
work
with
other
more
delicate
cheeses
a
750ml
bottle
is
not
going
to
be
a
problem
and
i
would
drink
it
again
cheers
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
resultant
mouthfeel
is
generally
smooth
and
mildly
crisp
on
the
palate
very
organized
in
procession
not
a
bad
faro
it
could
use
some
more
funkiness
as
it
is
completely
devoid
of
this
character
in
the
flavor
the
sweetness
is
not
too
overwhelming
here
and
i
could
almost
see
myself
drinking
this
again
though
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
3
fonteinen
faro
d
im
not
sure
about
this
one
its
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
a
bit
restrained
and
uninteresting
its
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
has
quite
an
unusual
composition
of
flavors
lots
of
malts
and
caramel
considering
that
its
a
lambic
i
would
have
liked
more
character
and
en
edgier
profile
with
less
sweetness
NA
oa
very
drinkable
faro
that
big
sour
fans
probably
wont
care
for
overall
this
is
more
sugar
water
the
sourness
is
there
but
doesnt
want
to
come
forward
this
same
beer
was
given
an
alias
for
the
brussels
food
month
and
marathon
in
2012
they
were
calling
it
brusselicious
and
even
bottled
it
under
that
name
each
runner
received
a
free
bottle
i
just
got
around
to
drinking
mine
it
pours
with
about
two
fingers
of
head
with
a
very
spread
out
white
lace
that
sticks
around
indefinitely
it
has
a
very
sweet
followed
by
sour
nose
i
loved
the
flavor
it
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
it
is
almost
like
grape
and
apple
it
has
a
very
thin
feel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
ok
pretty
much
tastes
like
carbonated
preschool
i
feel
like
i
should
go
take
a
nap
on
the
floor
now

overal
a

the

work
nicely
for
an

beer
stop
while
in
brussels
dr
easy
to
down
but
nothing
special
refreshing
but
very
disappointing
considering
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
this
is
a
beer
that
may
suffer
from
rarityinduced
hype
though
its
certainly
pleasant
its
just
more
of
a
cider
than
a
beer
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
tasting
but
still
thin
bodied
and
simplistically
very
cider
like
there
is
a
touch
of
caramelized
apple
character
here
a
faint
tartness
seems
more
apple
like
than
from
lactic
acid
despite
the
fact
that
it
must
actually
be
from
lactic
acid
there
is
perhaps
a
touch
of
acetic
acid
here
that
accentuates
and
brings
out
an
apple
cider
vinegar
like
flavor
in
the
finish
after
having
the
3
fonteinen
faro
a
couple
blocks
away
it
is
amazing
how
absolutely
pathetic
this
beer
is
it
tastes
like
apple
cider
juice
with
no
complexity
and
lots
of
cloying
sweetness
trying
this
for
the
first
time
at
a
la
becasse
in
brussels
served
in
a
pottery
pitcher
pours
a
clear
apple
juice
gold
a
few
bubbles
for
head
the
die
quickly
leaving
you
with
a
glass
of
light
applepear
smelling
beverage
smooth
and
clean
tasting
a
hint
of
tart
like
sipping
noncarbonated
hard
cider
very
different
actually
completely
different
when
compared
to
the
more
famous
and
more
consumed
belgium
blondes
and
brunes
delicious
and
a
very
pleasant
experience
overall
very
fun
to
drink
it
walks
the
thin
line
of
balancing
sweet
and
tart
certainly
a
unique
brew
and
well
worth
hunting
down
i
recommend
that
all
beer
lovers
who
visit
belgium
try
this
the
old
fashioned
way
and
enjoy
a
little
piece
of
brewing
history
a
really
wonderful
lambic
and
a
unique
experience
in
brussels
get
to
la
becasse
if
only
to
try
one
pitcher
of
this
throwback
drinkability
magnificently
drinkable
by
the
end
of
our
time
at
la
becasse
i
had
about
8
or
10
servings
of
this
beer
in
the
little
glasses
it
is
remarkably
refreshing
and
not
overly
sweet
especially
for
a
faro
style
beer
very
enjoyable
and
i
look
forward
to
going
back
and
drinking
more
on
my
next
trip
to
brussels
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
overall
a
sweetened
version
of
the
usual
lambic
beer
that
once
acquired
wide
spread
popularity
in
the
brussels
area
but
is
now
extremely
hard
to
find
in
its
traditional
format
like
lambic
faro
is
an
acquired
taste
but
the
timmermans
draft
version
is
such
a
classic
example
of
the
style
that
it
is
worth
the
visit
to
brussels
alone
to
try
it
for
i
am
sure
it
will
one
day
disappear
for
good
this
one
pours
a
small
head
with
a
very
nice
ambercoppertangerine
colour
smell
of
vinegar
apples
cider
wood
sour
and
a
bit
funky
not
much
carbonation
and
maybe
too
light
in
the
palate
taste
of
cider
vtoo
much
sugar
but
it
keeps
some
sourness
and
vinegar
notes
good
though
id
always
take
a
lambic
instead
the
lambic
character
seems
to
have
made
it
less
into
this
than
it
should
have
the
aroma
is
actually
entirely
devoid
of
anything
resembling
lambic
not
bad
and
sort
of
refreshing
bc
it
is
so
clean
but
really
seems
more
like
sweet
tea
with
fake
lemon
added
than
anything
and
i
am
nor
really
a
fan
of
that
drinkability
one
of
the
few
beers
where
the
taste
is
exceptional
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
major
detriment
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
md
mild
tartness
and
candied
sugared
sweetness
makes
this
beer
too
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
could
find
this
in
my
home
town
so
i
could
enjoy
it
on

and
humid
indiana
summer
day
bottle
poured
a
deep
orangey
color
lambic
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
not
much
retention
or
lacing
aroma
of
sour
and
tart
notes
with
some
light
funk
is
surprising
nothing
close
to
actual
lambic
but
still
retains
some
of
the
characteristics
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
some
tart
notes
with
some
light
oak
not
sure
why
apple
juice
was
added
in
there
but
it
was
not
overly
noticeable
d
wow
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
swear
this
is
a
cider
aged
in
oak
with
a
great
yeast
the
beer
is
subtle
but
has
a
nice
complexity
that
has
a
new
layer
with
each
sip
golden
orange
colour
with
a
small

of

apples

is

lollyish

sour
acidic
and
vinegary
with
some
grainy
wheat
flavours
underneath
reminiscent
of
a
sweet
fruity
white
wine
medium
bodied
and
acidic
mouthfeel
a
sweet
fruity
and
winey
lambic
clearly
a
spontaneous
fermented
base
with
sweet
caramelized
notes
o
not
like
any
other
beer
that
i
have
had
but
well
recommended
easily
the
best
faro
that
i
have
had
to
date
a

broken

deep

clear

no

a
bit

a

taste
is
certainly
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
rest
of
cantillon
products
big

wet

tart
not
sour
mouthfeel
well
on
the
light
side
no
effervescence
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
rare
unbottled
treat
but
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
worth
a
try
for
the
ticker
which
im
not
my
first
faro
pours
burnt
orange
with
one
finger
of
persistent
offwhite
head
interesting
mix
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
a
bit
look
like
a
candied
grapefruit
interesting
to
say
the
least
seems
like
initially
the
flavors
dont
blend
very
well
but
if
you
hold
it
in
your
mouth
for
awhile
it
comes
together
lots
of
lemongrapefruit
with
an
initial
burst
of
sugar
finish
is
quite
bitter
certainly
would
not
want
to
have
this
very
often
but
very
glad
i
tried
it
that
was
good
to
try
being
less
intense
as
other
cantillons
it
might
be
a
good
starter
to
somebody
trying
to
work
their
way
into
the
brand

smells
a
bit
like
feet
followed
by
a
sweet
quality
taste
starts
of
sweet
somewhat
akin
to
caramelized
sugar
followed
by
an
earthyherbal
quality
citric
acid
and
some
medicinal
notes
towards
the
back
with
a
hint
of
artificial
sweetener
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
still
carbonation
however
there
is
a
bit
of
substance
to
body
as
well
as
a
slightly
creamy
texture
overall
this
beer
is
good
for
what
it
is
a
sour
beer
infused
with
candi
sugar
not
a
beer
i
need
to
revisit
but
i
found
it
considerably
better
than
my
first
impression
of
the
style
lindemans
easy
to
drink
as
there
is
no
sourness
but
it
loses
a
lot
of
the
best
characteristics
of
most
cantillon
beers
the
beer
is
light
copper
hued
with
a
half
inch
of
head
the
aroma
is
funky
and
smells
like
cantillon
with
the
addition
of
some
sweet
fruity
tones
these
scents
carry
over
into
the
flavor
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
tartness
and
funk
playing
supporting
roles
light
bodied
and
fizzy
on
the
palate
with
lingering
sweetness
reminiscent
of
a
soda
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
faros
but
this
is
likely
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
o
a
strange
beer
in
regards
to
aromas
and
flavor
not
very
pleasant
to
me
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
i
love
the
brewery
and
the
tour
but
this
beer
is
not
one
i
could
love
despite
my
best
effort
overall
i
admit
that
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
enough
the
sweet
and
bitter
is
weird
when
combined
this
way
cheers
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
bit
sugary
and
a
pear
fruitiness
in
the
taste
just
like
the
aroma
a
bit
sugary
and
pears
but
not
too
sweet
at
all
a
smooth
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
tart
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
wow
love
it
all
day
sour
and
a
nice
fruitiness
with
a
dry
end
pour
yields
a
brew
that
looks
a
bit
like
apple
cider
with
a
few
bubbles
no
real
head
or
lacing
but
thats
normal
for
the
style
so
i
wont
dock
there
the
nose
is
slightly
cidery
with
some
earthy
must
maybe
must
more
than
cider
a
bit
of
funk
light
sweetness
comes
in
during
the
taste
light
body
with
a
faint
bit
of
sugar
and
mild
funk
no
real
acidity
nice
enough
to
try
but
id
much
rather
have
the
young
lambic
without
the
sugar
b
good
body
despite
the
low
no
carbonation
i
guess
the
sugar
reverts
many
attributes
to
the
mean
i
liked
this
very
happy
to
try
it
but
its
not
something
im
likely
to
reach
for
again
i
really
prefer
the
more
sour
creations
o
of
the
few
faros
out
there
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
d
extremely
drinkable
like
any
cantillon
i
suppose
could
never
get
enough
d
pretty
drinkable
pour
was
chestnut
with
a
smallhead
that
quicklz
dissipated
now
was
herbal
funk
like
that
of
old
chamomile
tea
that
had
been
sitting
out
it
had
an
interesting
zest
of
herbs
that
was
backed
by
a
interesting
sweet
a
bit
astringent
but
more
sweet
seemed
like
a
digestive
aid
it
was
a
tad
on
the
tart
but
it
was
a
smooth
flavor
with
a
backbone
of
sugar
a
bit
sweet
to
have
more
than
250ml
but
still
an
intersting
experience
as
ive
had
just
one
other
faro
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
this
to
this
is
easier
to
drink
than
boons
hence
the
3
5
ratings
but
thats
not
much
of
a
recommendation
d
this
is
wonderfully
drinkable
it
actually
seems
to
be
wonderfully
thirstquenching
as
well
drinkable
on
this
cool
afternoon
in
march
and
i
can
only
wonder
how
lovely
it
would
be
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
the
beer
poured
dead
flat
not
a
bubble
could
be
found
and
there
wasnt
a
trace
of
lacing
the
body
was
a
dark
amber
almost
chestnut
color
the
aroma
was
quite
mead
like
with
strong
apricot
notes
in
fact
i
could
have
easily
been
convinced
that
this
was
an
apricot
mead
i
was
drinking
the
taste
started
like
the
nose
honey
and
apricot
sweetness
but
that
gave
way
to
an
oaky
center
and
a
interesting
funky
finish
characteristic
cantillon
funk
was
there
but
the
strongest
note
was
of
cream
in
fact
this
beer
left
an
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
long
after
each
sip
similar
to
half
and
half
and
reminded
me
of
working
on
a
dairy
farm
this
trait
was
also
quite
similar
to
something
i
have
found
in
some
drei
fonteinen
beers
and
is
very
pleasant
an
excellent
and
highly
unique
experience
very
easy
to
drink
pairs
easily
with
about
any
food
my
third
favorite
faro
1
is
grardin
2
is
drie
fonteinen
bitterness
not
any
its
a
lambic
its
really
lactic
perfectly
lactic
and
the
sweetness
of
the
candy
make
it
just
perfect
to
be
drunk
again
and
again
with
or
withour
foods
its
perfect
the
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
just
a
few
bubbles
around
the
edge
no
carbonation
but
that
is
to
be
expected
with
how
the
beer
was
served
and
the
style
the
aroma
was
sweet
not
really
candy
sweet
but
borderline
not
as
sweet
as
other
faros
in
belgium
the
taste
was
sweet
up
front
but
there
was
some
of
the
trademark
cantillon
tartness
that
balanced
this
beer
out
very
well
although
not
my
favorite
lambic
style
but
i
find
it
very
interesting
and
everytime
i
can
find
one
i
go
after
it
overall
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
faro
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
a
little
odd
and
the
sweetness
was
a
little
much
but
i
was
pleased
with
how
the
lambic
characteristics
werent
completely
masked
my
the
addition
of
sugars
and
caramel
faro
truly
is
an
aquired
taste
a
taste
that
i
have
yet
to
aquire
faro
is
unblended
lambic
in
which
caramel
and
candy
sugar
is
added
during
bottling
time
i
believe
that
cantillon
uses
1
12
year
old
lambic
when
making
this
one
i
sampled
this
at
spinnekopke
in
brussels
belgium
notes
definitely
interesting
it
was
like
a
lambic
for
people
who
couldnt
handle
the
real
thing
candi
sugar
hides
all
the
wonderful
aromas
and
flavors
of
the
real
lambic
but
it
was
a
nice
dessert
accompanyment
enjoyed
at
the
in
t
spinnekopke
in
brussels
i
ordered
a
kriek
sorbet
and
faro
for
desert
the
sorbet
was
so
very
tart
that
this
sugary
sweetness
was
a
perfect
match
for
it
a
dark
carmellybrown
looking
liquid
that
was
completely
still
sugary
sweet
in
the
aroma
and
taste
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
on
its
own
but
honestly
this
perfectly
offset
the
tartness
of
my
desert
worth
searching
out
in
brussels
though
mainly
for
its
traditional
and
unique
character

when
at
cantillon
the
other
week
i
was
chatting
to
mr
van
roy
about
where
i
could
sample
the
draught
lambic
and
faro
he
said
that
no
lambic
was
in
brussels
right
now
but
that
the
faro
could
be
found
at
the
le
zageman
lambic
cafe
in
brussels
so
we
walked
to
le
zageman
and
ordered
two
dimpled
mugs
of
cantillon
faro
for
2
euros
a
piece
the
brew
was
a
dark
red
colour
with
no
head
the
aromas
were
of
cantillons
funky
lambicy
gueuze
mixed
with
some
sweet
candy
sugar
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
this
still
had
a
bunch
of
lambic
funk
and
some
nice
malt
to
it
but
the
candy
sugar
really
made
this
an
easytodrink
thirst
quencher
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
but
it
lends
itself
well
to
this
style
of
beer
and
the
drinkability
was
very
very
excellent
im
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
in
a
very
authentic
brussels
cafe
no
less
ok
i
was
glad
to
see
other
reviews
say
there
is
no
carbonation
in
this
one
because
i
thought
maybe
there
was
something
wrong
or
maybe
theres
always
something
wrong
i
had
a
glass
of
this
in
the
only
place
one
could
find
it
in
brussels
last
week
zageman
according
to
mr
van
roy
it
was
a
light
brownish
colour
no
head
since
it
was
flat
it
smelled
sweet
and
tart
pretty
nice
actually
it
tasted
almost
like
sweetened
iced
tea
actually
had
that
tart
lemony
taste
and
very
sugary
i
liked
it
not
funky
as
cantillon
usually
is
with
their
other
beers
mouthfeel
was
just
flat
strange
to
me
for
a
beer
but
interesting
nonetheless
so
drinkability
is
good
because
its
obviously
not
filling
and
its
quite
refreshing
i
was
happy
to
have
found
this
one
definitely
this
strangely
enough
tasted
similar
to
a
lightly
sweetened
herbal
tea
quite
flat
a
bit
astringent
and
with
a
pleasing
herbal
and
flowery
character
to
it
this
is
the
only
sweetened
offering
from
cantillon
and
i
believe
it
is
only
availible
from
the
brewery
where
they
add
a
bit
of
sugar
to
it
just
before
serving
i
sampled
this
lambic
at
the
cantillon
brewery
for
my
first
faro
i
knew
to
expect
sweetness
but
not
this
much
the
beer
pours
a
distinctive
glowing
golden
hue
with
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
carbonation
is
nowhere
to
be
found
as
this
one
is
flat
candy
sugar
is
present
in
the
nose
and
certainly
in
the
taste
to
me
this
one
tasted
like
flat
sprite
as
it
was
very
syrupy
this
is
one
of
cantillons
more
limited
offerings
however
i
dont
have
much
interest
in
trying
it
again
cantillon
faro
is
therefore
unique
and
really
quite
rare
these
days
very
clear
bronze
body
and
very
little
head
to
speak
of
lots
of
visible
bubbles
smells
and
tastes
an
awful
lot
like
apple
juicemass
produced
cider
sweet
and
fruity
with
just
the
lightest
touch
of
acidity
and
funk
not
really
what
i
want
in
a
faro
its
just
not
beery
enough
more
like
a
wonky
alcopop
that
said
its
not
unpleasant
and
quite
easy
to
drink
in
a
pimms
cup
kind
of
way
possible
food
pairings
goat
cheese
and
caramelised
onions
pulled
pork
roast
duck
chicken
and
waffles
hummus
overall
an
interesting
beer
kind
of
like
a
green
candy
apple
okay
to
try
once
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
overall
first
of
style
and
a
little
too
sweet
for
this
palate
unsure
if
it
would
get
more
complex
as
2014
approaches
leaves
me
overall
unsure

that

its

too
much
for
me
perhaps
this
is
someones
cup
of

but
it
is
certainly
not
mine
beer
is
medium

with
carbonation
of
low

resulting
in
a
smooth

that
marginally
foams
up

keeps
it

from
phyl21
wow
its
been
quite
some
time
since
ive
gotten
that
lambic
nose
the
flavor
profile
is
oh
so
nice
the
last
time
i
had
a
faro
was
some
time
ago
so
my
recollection
of
the
style
is
hard
to
go
on
from
here
but
this
seems
so
good
interesting
balance
i
wonder
if
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
least
understood
beer
styles
out
there
it
tastes
like
apple
juice
a
little
bit
thin
and
sweet
with
a
fruitiness
not
good
i
drank
the
whole
thing
but
i
wont
ever
have
it
again
very
well
carbonated
oppressively

easily
noticeable
candi

and
a
light

body
is
somewhat
thin

is
a
pleasant
change
from
the
heavy
alcohol
laden
brews
i
usually
drink
when
in
belgium
if
you
like
faro
this
one
is
a
good
but
not
outstanding
served
in
a
mort
subite
glass
with
a
belgian
gauffre
by
its
side
by
the
way
the
two
goes
really
nice
one
with
the
other
reddish
in
colour
with
a
nice
big
head
that
really
tempers
down
the
smell
taste
sweet
candied
sugar
up
front
almost
no
classical
lambic
tart
felling
probably
one
of
the
best
product
of
the
mort
subite
series
is
this
due
to
rareness
maybe
so
but
if
you
go
to
this
caffé
have
one
because
its
impossible
to
have
it
otherwise
draft
on
tap
at
mort
subite
in
brussels
over
the
christmas
holiday
sampled
this
beer
while
sitting
at
a
table
back
table
next
to
the
bars
cat
beer
poured
a
light
amber
body
with
a
very
slight
body
of
carbonation
smooth
bod
with
a
candy
sweet
nose
and
taste
but
not
too
sugary
as
i
expected
there
was
also
a
nice
bit
of
tartness
that
made
for
a
decent
beer
sampled
at
a
la
mort
subite
in
brussels
it
came
out
a
clear
cognac
color
under
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
to
collar
leaving
just
a
couple
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
mild
of
fruit
with
clear
cherry
notes
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
slightly
heavy
but
not
at
all
sticky
strong
cherry
flavor
overwhelms
the
malt
and
nearly
eliminates
the
hops
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
but
the
tart
wins
out
lasting
long
into
the
aftertaste
tasty
but
a
bit
onesided
on
the
fruit
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
lambic
much
better
and
more
complex
than
the
mort
subite
framboise
i
tasted
previously
tap
at
the
mort
subite
cafe
in
brussels
this
is
a
beautiful
red
colored
beer
with
huge
with
head
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
with
some
very
subtle
touch
of
malt
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
nice
touch
of
oak
at
the
end
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
kriek
carbonation
is
good
and
body
is
thin
which
makes
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
to
sip
during
a
hot
summer
day
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
mort
subite
product
that
i
had
the
chance
to
taste
had
to
try
this
while
in
brussels
carmel
color
rusty
brown
very
transparent
and
clear
in
the
goblet
slight
outer
ring
to
the
brew
but
that
is
it
not
much
head
or
lacing
caramel
in
the
nose
sweetness
light
refreshing
body
and
feel
with
a
sparkle
on
the
tongue
tangy
and
dry
sweet
and
then
slightly
sour
in
the
taste
a
dominant
caramel
taste
not
really
rounded
or
complex
but
refreshing
the
rare
faro
of
mort
subite
sampled
on
draught
at
the
mort
subite
cafe
in
brussels
this
is
a
dark
reddish
colour
with
a
small
head
of
offwhite
aromas
are
of
gueuze
funk
sugar
and
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
candy
sugar
really
sticking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
this
faro
is
far
less
sweet
than
lindemans
version
of
the
three
faros
that
i
have
had
id
rate
this
above
lindemans
but
below
cantillons
