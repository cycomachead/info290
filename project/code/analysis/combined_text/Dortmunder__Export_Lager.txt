comes
across
like
a
cream
ale
a
bit
sour
a
bit
hoppy
with
decent
malt
highly
carbonated
with
a
neutral
body
overall
drinkability
not
knowing
what
this
style
was
exactly
when
it
was
served
in
the
restaurant
i
looked
it
up
during
the
meal
thank
you
ba
app
when
i
saw
it
was
a
dortmunder
after
having
drank
about
13
of
the
glass
i
thought
something
must
be
wrong
or
someone
thought
if
you
combine
a
hefe
a
lager
and
some
spices
that
this
would
be
a
dortmunder
im
going
to
assume
the
brewer
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
the
odd
flavors
i
got
was
due
to
poor
service
at
the
restaurant
but
whatever
the
case
this
is
not
a
beer
i
want
again
and
i
found
it
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
griff
comments
this
beer
has
more
flavor
and
body
than
most
golden
lagers
it
is
very
drinkable
and
balanced
while
remaining
interesting
talk
your
average
joe
friends
into
trying
this
beer
to
expand
their
beer
drinking
experience
this
isnt
quite
the
traditional
style
lager
i
expected
this
one
isnt
going
to
win
any
contests
in
my
opinion
but
its
name
rhymes
with
itself
and
is
possibly
a
double
entendre
if
youre
a
pervert
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
goes
down
easy
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
dark
gold
color
with
no
head
interesting
spicy
aroma
taste
was
rich
flavorful
malt
with
a
little
burst
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
sufficient
for
style
crisp
and
refreshing
but
kinda
one
dimensional
good
for
thirst
quenching
but
not
much
else
i
first
thought
this
was
coors
extra
gold
but
this
grows
on
you
d
this
was
a
solid
beer
offering
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
i
have
from
the
brewery
worth
checking
out
the
aroma
is
way
off
for
the
style
but
not
altogether
horrible
as
its
slightly
citrusy
there
is
definitely
malt
and
its
the
corn
type
but
there
is
also
an
ale
like
smell
to
it
as
well
as
metal
and
a
touch
of
sour
funk
the
appearance
is
dead
on
its
golden
with
a
little
hazy
and
a
big
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
soapy
astringent
finish
the
palate
is
typical
for
the
style
overall
its
an
off
beer
but
somehow
its
got
enough
to
it
to
make
it
sort
of
interesting
outstanding
drinkability
on
the
other
hand
for
me
is
bad
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
so
i
might
not
be
a
great
judge
here
but
i
would
rank
this
with
so
many
micros
in
my
book
by
the
fact
i
would
just
order
water
with
my
meal
before
ordering
this
beer
again
this
is
the
second
of
the
dsb
offerings
ive
sampled
and
it
was
pretty
solid
stuff
a
deep
golden
with
nice
carbonation
and
durable
head
s
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
with
neither
winning
out
t
very
much
like
the
nose
but
give
the
slight
edge
to
the
hops
mild
smooth
and
tasty
m
light
but
right
for
a
lager
d
very
much
a
beer
that
should
be
repeated
crisp
and
refreshing
just
what
you
want
from
a
lager
nice
job
depot
street
top
notch
lager
with
a
powerful
peanut
butter
smell
a
more
crisp
refined
taste
with
just
a
dollop
of
pb
a
a
well
made
lager
brewed
with
care
rather
than
provided
as
an
afterthought
for
patrons
who
cluelessly
request
something
light
refreshing
on
this
surprisingly
hot
day
overall
a
good
take
on
a
lighter
european
lager
very
light
and
easy
drinking
but
whats
there
tastes
good
this
would
be
a
good
step
up
for
your
average
bmc
drinker
really
enjoyable
drink
worked
fine
in
middle
of
winter
and
would
at
any
time
an
easy
drinking
lager
nothing
more
nothing
less
o
good
beer
but
not
my
style
it
was
a
part
of
their
mainstay
sampler
so
here
i
am
drinking
it
and
enjoying
overall
not
bad
this
beer
arrives
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
bready
biscuity
malt
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
the
aroma
is
similar
to
the
taste
with
a
rich
bready
finish
that
lingers
a
moment
the
cleans
up
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
lighter
than
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
dortmunder
that
i
will
drink
again
without
hesitation
i
thought
the
dortmunder
lager
was
quite
nice
the
appearance
was
a
golden
clear
with
thin
white
head
that
laced
the
smell
included
hop
and
grain
somewhat
like
a
pilsner
the
taste
was
bolstered
by
the
saaz
hops
used
and
was
quite
good
the
beer
was
nicely
balanced
with
malt
and
hop
definitely
a
nice
session
lager
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
o
an
average
dortmunder
and
average
beer
not
anything
id
have
again
dortmunder
is
kind
of
a
boring
style
and
even
for
style
this
is
boring
on
tap
at
the
brewery
poured
into
a
sampler
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
yellow
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
grainy
and
sweet
with
some
spicy
continental
type
aroma
hops
bread
comes
through
as
well
on
taste
sweeter
than
expected
has
a
nice
level
of
bitterness
and
bready
malts
but
is
just
a
touch
sweet
well
enough
made
and
clean
just
perhaps
a
touch
underattenuated
medium
bodied
and
mild
carbonation
throughout
one
of
the
better
dortmunders
i
ever
had
solid
medium
body
clean
round
firm
and
bready
with
a
smooth
tender
snappy
tang
thats
definately
drinkable
much
like
everything
else
at
town
hall
growler
gone
now
and
feeling
good
and
feeling
full
skip
this
beer
overall
an
easy
drinking
lager
very
clean
and
refreshing
i
could
have
more
of
this
one
in
the
line
up
of
regular
house
taps
it
came

golden
color
with
a
fresh
1
finger
head
and
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
maltgraingrassbread
and
noble
hops
taste
is
malts
and
then
some
crisp
noble
hops
followed
by
some
earthy
grain
and
bread
just
a
touch
of
lemon
citrus
its
good
mouth
feel
was
medium
to
thin
nicely
carbonated
and
crisp
very
drinkable
til
the
end
which
had
me
wanting
another
a
solid
dortmunder
which
is
nice
to
see
its
great
drinking
a
nice
wet
refreshing
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
minnesota
beer
is
light
in
body
and
quite
smooth
and
nice
minimal
aftertaste
nice
grainy
feel
to
it
without
bad
bitterness
from
the
beer
overall
and
all
around
i
really
enjoy
these
bigger
lagers
i
kind
of
wish
it
was
at
4
so
i
could
drink
10
of
them
but
oh
well
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
decentsized
white
head
the
smell
involves
some
grainygrassy
malt
and
a
bit
of
german
hops
the
taste
has
a
slight
fruitiness
with
some
pilsnertype
hop
bitterness
lots
of
grain
going
on
in
this
dortmunder
but
in
a
good
way
light
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
very
refreshing
and
quaffable
beer
has
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
poor
rentention
light
aroma
some
grain
present
has
somewhat
of
a
sweet
malty
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
nicely
balanced
light
bodied
refreshing
and
with
nice
drinkability
another
solid

offering
my
girlfriend
not
a
craft
drinker
enjoyed
this
as
well
as
the
kolsch
she
had
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
pours

i
enjoyed

great
refreshing
beer
not
as
bitter
as
a
pilsner
but
definitely
more
punch
than
a
helles
pretty
good
dortmunder
overall
d
this
could
serve
as
a
gatewaytransition
beer
for
lager
lovers
certainly
easy
drinking
note
i
am
assuming
that
this
is
the
correct
listing
for
what
i
had
it
was
simply
called
export
lager
on
the
beer
list
a
new
addition
to
the
lineup
replacing
the
light
version
that
had
transitioned
people
from
bud
the
aroma
was
a
bit
cheesy
the
colour
was
clear
and
orange
and
lacey
a
light
mouthfeel
low
hop
ibu
but
a
nice
bitterness
for
a
melange
of
czech
and
german
hops
very
drinkable
though
the
ratings
follow
the
boldness
this
is
very
good
for
the
style
final
grade
3
84
a
solid
b
this
is
not
really
one
of
my
favourite
german
lager
styles
but
howe
sounds
lager
is
still
definitely
one
of
the
best
dortmunders
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
the
malts
provide
a
clean
biscuity
sweetness
that
is
perfectly
countered
by
the
grassy
floral
european
hop
bill
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
manages
to
provide
everything
i
expect
from
this
style
in
spades
german
lager
fans
will
definitely
want
to
give
this
one
a
shot
but
anyone
looking
for
something
straightforward
to
glug
back
in
a
social
environment
should
consider
this
a
perfectly
valid
selection
m
surprisingly
chewy
i
could
use
a
bit
more
bitterness
but
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
lager
o
i
really
love
this
beer
super
versatile
as
it
pairs
with
most
foods
really
well
i
call
the
lager
that
has
character
it
is
malty
and
smooth
yet
flavourful
its
in
my
top
three
beers
overall
wow
this
was
a
disappointment
this
must
be
an
off
can
cloyingly
sweet
and
sour
flavours
howe
sound
is
known
for
a
much
higher
standard
of
beer
and
this
does
not
fit
into
their
lineup
unfortunately
this
is
a
drain
pour
will
maybe
try
a
different
can
and
rereview
a
rather
fullflavoured
lager
with
a
decent
aromatic
structure
leave
it
to
this
brewer
to
make
a
complex
quite
drinkable
and
simply
packaged
lager
but
here
it
is
thanks
to
my
boss
who
brought
a
can
back
from
his
whistler
vacation
i
had
a
chance
to
part
take
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
faint
from
what
is
present
there
is
a
bready
tone
good
flavor
of
malt
and
nuts
with
some
light
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
i
could
have
several
if
given
a
chance
for
style
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
im
not
saying
this
is
going
to
make
your
day
like
a
giant
stout
or
dipa
but
its
a
satisfying
i
could
drink
again
pours
a
light
honey
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
mostly
disappears
leaving
a
minimum
of
lacing
smells
sweet
with
some
bread
mineral
and
hops
the
flavor
is
all
noble
hops
with
some
bitterness
balanced
out
by
sweet
malts
and
a
nutty
finish
has
a
light
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
and
refreshing
lager
probably
my
favorite
from
bc
i
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
it
beats
ass
over
any
of
the
macros
any
day
of
the
week
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
certanly
worth
trying
for
me
it
isnt
really
worth
seeking
out
again
but
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color

flavor
of

nuts
with
some
light
bitterness
nice
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
probably
the
best
bc
produced
lager
ive
tried
so
far
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
nothing
to
look
at
neutral
colour
neutral
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
lagerish
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
like
a
macro
with
organic
like
ingrediants
they
do
make
better
beer
moer
drinkable
than
the
canned
version
newer
summer
product
i
love
their
1l
bottles
but
i
also
love
a
good
craft
in
a
can
hopefully
the
do
some
more
lagers
excellent
overall
a
very
respectable

set
aside
your

as
fizzy

brews

a

brew
with

refined

rather
subtle
aroma
and
taste
sure
it
is
neither
rich
nor
bold
but
very
pleasing
nonetheless
it
is
above
average
in
all
respects
but
the
perfectly
carbonated
lively
but
soft
mouthfeel
may
be
its
strongest
point
in
fact
even
some
of
the
most
renown
beer
writers
have
had
difficulty
pinning
down
exactly
what
distinguishes
the
style
from
other
pale
lagers
one
thing
we
know
for
sure
dortmunders
originated
in
an
industrial
city
not
an
artsy
one
it
is
a
utilitarian
beer
by
design
produced
to
deliver
efficient
thorough
refreshment
not
contemplative
sipping
thirsty
dog
gets
it
pours
golden
straw
with
a
thin
white
head
which
disappears
quickly
seems
very
carbonated
aroma
has
all
the
typical
notes
of
a
lager
light
slightly
sweet
and
bready
the
taste
is
very
fruity
at
the
tounge
which
turns
to
a
bready
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
middle
of
the
road
for
me
ive
had
lagers
that
are
better
and
worse
overall
i
would
like
to
see
the
bready
malt
kicked
up
a
notch
to
balance
the
sweetness
o
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
will
serve
you
well
on
a
hot
day
to
cool
off
it
is
definitely
worth
a
drink
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
overallcomments
this
was
a
very
tasty
well
put
together
brew
that
goes
down
easy
and
wont
fill
you
up

classified

o
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
heavier
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
its
a
bit
fruity
and
floral
for
the
style
it
feels
like
its
approaching
a
bock
in
many
ways
body
sweetness
but
overall
its
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
and
it
were
available
locally
i
would
make
it
one
of
my
go
to
beers
o
the
only
other
beer
of
this
style
i
have
had
in
great
lakes
dortmunder
this
has
a
different
taste
to
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
british
style
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
how
good
it
is
overall
a
decent
enough
dortmunder
though
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
hop
balance
notes
dam
this
is
tasty
an
amazing
meal
in
a
bottle
and
very
drinkable
cheers
overall
this
is
just
a
beautiful
example
of
the
dortmunder
lager
one
of
the
best
ive
had
well
balanced
true
to
style
if
you
like
them
a
little
drier
and
hoppier
get
great
lakes
bc
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
a
little
while
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
bready
and
sweet
malt
and
some
light
grassy
hops
it
tastes
like
bready
and
sweet
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
enough
this
certainly
isnt
one
of
the
better
dortmunder
lagers
ive
had
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
theres
nothing
about
this
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
it
again
lager
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
good
one
some
craft
brews
are
just
overpowering
golden
color
yeasty
nose
and
a
thin
head
nicely
hopped
and
a
slightly
sweet
finish
i
enjoyed
it
as
much
or
more
as
other
ohio
craft
lagers
enjoyable
by
itself
and
washing
down
some
nachos
as
i
watch
hockey
notes
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
current
interest
in
drier
germanstyle
lagers
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
bittering
hops
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
wasnt
a
good
example
of
a
dortmunder
the
flavors
were
bland
and
there
was
way
too
much
sweetness
that
seemed
to
dominate
everything
else
this
beer
doesnt
have
good
drinkability
it
doesnt
hold
my
interest
and
is
way
too
sweet
one
is
more
then
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
label
its
pretty
sad
that
the
label
was
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
but
thats
the
truth
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
else
there
wasnt
one
part
of
this
beer
that
didnt
have
some
issues
and
the
sweetness
really
hurt
it
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
this
seems
to
be
the
first
miss
that
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
it
just
missed
the
mark
on
what
a
good
dortmunder
should
be
like
and
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
dortmunder
i
have
had
with
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
still
being
my
favorite
and
this
beer
isnt
even
remotely
as
good
as
great
lakes
dortmunder
i
took
a
chance
on
this
beer
and
it
didnt
turn
out
how
i
thought
it
would
oh
well
you
cant
win
them
all
better
luck
next
time
thirsty
dog
in
cleveland
and
tried
the
labrador
from
thirsty
dog
the
beer
poured
clear
golden
color
with
some
white
foamish
head
that
left
some
lace
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
strong
yeast
some
malts
the
taste
is
typical
of
most
dortmunders
some
fruit
grassy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
can
be
sessioned
easily
one
hell
of
a
yellow
lager
that
competes
with
glbc
dortmunder
gold
o
pretty
accurate
to
style
quite
quaffable
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
malts
taste
is
crisp
grains
some
malts
a
tad
sweet
just
a
touch
of
hops
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
pretty
good
beer
d
it
goes
down
easily
and
it
quite
quaffable
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
it
was
both
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
and
pretty
enjoyable
overall
o
overall
a
very
easy
drinkable
beer
would
have
more
of
these

mmmm
pours

14

decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
earthy
malt
slight
citrus
hops
and
hint
of
dough
fits
the
style
of
a
dortmunder
export
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
dough
slight
citrus
hops
and
hint
of
earthy

overall
poor
appearance
but
good
aroma
blend
and
body
really
nice
and
tight
looking
as
white
head
of
maybe
an
inch
and
a
half
came
up
and
settled
down
fading
slightly
but
holding
its
own
light
grains
and
bready
malt
notes
really
pulling
through
here
some
smattering
of
hops
in
there
but
again
nothing
really
pushing
that
way
this
was
a
well
rounded
and
very
straight
forward
lager
as
i
take
the
first
sip
crisp
clean
flavor
rolls
across
the
taste
buds
really
very
well
put
together
earthy
nice
touches
of
grain
and
smooth
mellow
caramel
notes
infiltrate
as
it
warms
light
banana
and
clove
maybe
then
coming
through
i
am
very
pleased
here
overall
i
like
this
lager
it
has
a
very
good
flavor
and
is
almost
in
the
ipa
territory
with
the
abv
smooth
an
easy
drinking
pleasant
beer
one
which
youll
enjoy
but
also
one
which
youll
frankly
find
rather
forgettable
a
serviceable
yeomanlike
brew
overall
a
slightly
hoppy
very
drinkable
lager
worthy
of
another
purchase
o
this
beer
tastes
like
if
anchor
steam
and
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
had
a
baby
this
is
very
nice
dortmunder
style
lager
from
thirsty
dog
i
actually
prefer
this
one
to
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
a
little
more
complex
taste
is
also
bready
with
some
definite
grains
as
well
nice
carbonation
the
grains
are
prominent
probably
typical
for
a
lager
which
i
just
dont
have
that
much
but
this
is
a
nice
surprise
good
substantive
beer
pretty
solid
would
buy
again
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
lager
more
flavor
than
expected
from
this
style
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
hey
this
is
a
golden
hazy
lager
it
smells
sweet
and
fruityhas
a
very
nice
aroma
next
up
as
far
as
taste
is
considered
i
wish
would
have
bought
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
single
o
yeah
taste
really
good
with
hints
of
bubblegumfruity
sweetness
and
not
really
too
hopp
driven
this
beer
is
a
very
smooth
and
refreshing
brew
look
foward
to
buying
more
i
couldnt
tell
the
abv
was
6
0
but
its
nice
to
know
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
thin
head
no
lace
the
aroma
has
faint
hints
of
dough
and
pine
its
flavor
is
grassy
with
a
bit
of
citrus
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
thirsty
dog
labrador
lager
is
an
average
beer
sessionable
and
refreshing
slightly
recommended
d
the
beer
comes
of
as
slightly
too
sweet
and
with
an
almost
cloying
finish
that
really
ruins
the
drinkability
also
the
lower
than
desired
carbonation
hurts
drinkability
this
has
a
glimmering
golden
color
and
a
lacing
that
most
beers
would
be
jealous
of
this
beer
has
a
malty
nose
and
a
hint
of
fruit
and
herbs
from
the
hops
smooth
lagers
with
a
clean
medium
body
win
us
over
this
is
one
of
those
its
malty
but
mostly
on
the
dry
side
the
hops
are
well
rounded
with
a
sizable
bitterness
and
a
drawn
out
somewhat
subtle
flavor
this
beer
is
bready
and
yeasty
with
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
a
very
impressive
lager
it
stands
bigger
and
more
complex
than
expected
d
very
drinkable
and
balanced
would
go
well
with
almost
anything
d
a
nice
american
take
on
the
style
nice
update
fresh
variety
pack
sample
of
this
beer
increased
freshness
equates
to
increased
enjoyment
pours
a
bright
golden
hue
with
a
slightly
hazed
body
maybe
a
bit
of
yeast
left
unfiltered
its
like
a
dortmunderkellerbier
aromatics
offer
up
a
liquid
bread
combination
of
malts
and
floral
hops
im
a
fan
for
sure

the

guidelines
without
any
issues
i
love
the
bright
white
flowing
head
leaves
even
layered
lines
of
speckled
textured
lacing
each
gulp
takes
you
into
a
very
refreshing
crisp
combination
of
rich
layered
biscuit
malts
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
balanced
with
herbal
grassy
german
hops
not
too
pungent
or
bitter
but
very
fresh
and
balanced
which
is
key
in
this
style
of
lager
mouthfeel
overall
is
as
pleasant
as
it
gets
and
as
hot
as
it
was
working
outside
today
the
beer
tastes
that
much
better
ample
natural
feeling
carbonation
crisp
inviting
finish
makes
you
want
to
take
the
next
sip
that
much
faster
overall
a
highly
drinkable
skillfully
brewed
and
meant
to
be
enjoyed
in
number
go
seek
some
out
if
your
in
ohio
or
some
of
the
limited
distribution
of
this
brewery
from
half

though
20

not

you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
maybe
thats
not
having
a
beer
all
week
and
its
hot
a
very
indifferent
beer
not
bad
not
great
just
middle
of
the
road
reasonably
drinkable
the
malt
profile
and
refreshing
flavor
is
ideal
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
enjoy
this
one
any
time
of
the
year
it
is
good
to
see
more
breweries
producing
this
style
in
the
end
i
love
the
style
and
love
the
beer
its
great
for
a
light
offering
and
even
better
for
a
lager
i
recommend
trying
this
for
a
great
lighter
microbrew
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
ive
had
12oz
bottle
into
a
boston
lager
glass
pours
a
crisp
very
bubbly
orange
with
a
decent
eggshell
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
crisp
sweet
malts
with
a
worthers
original
like
caramel
scent
to
it
the
taste
is
an
overabundance
of
sweet
malts
not
quite
cloying
but
almost
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
but
the
sweetness
gets
in
the
way
this
is
one
that
smells
way
better
than
it
tastes
not
anything
i
would
have
again
d
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
serving
type
12
fl
oz
bottle
d
i
could
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
stuff
great
with
food
great
just
by
itself
overall
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
handsdown
4
55
d
super
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
milder
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
that
is
lower
in
abv
d
good
can
drink
a
bunch
of
these
low
abv
enjoyable
taste
pours
a
rich
deep
golden
hue
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
smell
is
all
sweet
malts
first
taste
is
like
the
smell
bready
and
sugary
but
has
a
subtle
toastiness
almost
nutty
with
a
nice
dash
of
hops
for
the
bitter
finish
great
feel
excellent
combination
of
flavors
without
being
overthetop
i
would
gladly
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
picked
up
a
single
from
abes
cold
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
amber
with
a
short
white
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
the
malt
is
disappointingly
plain
with
a
mild
bready
cake
taste
and
aroma
the
hops
do
a
little
better
and
bring
both
floral
citrus
and
a
little
grassy
herb
forward
and
long
into
the
aftertaste
smooth
and
drinkable
but
unremarkable
aside
from
some
pleasant
hop
character
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
the
best
dortmunder
that
has
ever
entered
my
glass
labrador
lager
isnt
quite
that
good
but
its
a
surprisingly
wellbrewed
version
that
ill
definitely
look
for
again
this
is
a
great
allrounder
that
is
delicious
solo
and
should
accompany
most
foods
with
ridiculous
ease
definately
not
my
favorite
dortmundner
ive
only
tried
three
so
far
but
the
other
two
ive
had
blow
this
one
away
great
lakes
and
two
brothers
highly
carbonated
giving
it
a
crisp
mouthfeel
i
thought
i
had
smelled
the
telltale
signs
of
adjuncts
here
i
think
the
taste
confirms
it
overall
a
very
dry
beer
theres
some
bittering
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
notes
the
second
less
than
stellar
beer
out
of
thirsty
dog
had
their
barktoberfest
recently
these
were
the
first
two
thirsty
dog
beers
that
did
not
really
impress
me
i
found
there
cerebrus
10
and
siberian
night
to
be
exemplary
this
is
a
very
crafty
craft
brew
here
distinguished
looking
tasting
i
just
hope
we
can
get
this
yearround
it
would
be
nice
is
the
night
clubs
i
frequent
around
here
would
start
selling
it
actually
that
would
be
bad
i
would
drink
too
much
d
i
could
definitely
knock
over
a
16
barrel
of
this
stuff
in
a
couple
days
a
great
offering
from
the
boys
in
akrowdy
its
an
agreeable
beer
for
the
lighter
beer
drinkers
with
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
please
the
real
beer
drinkers
overall
a
very
solid
offering
from
thirsty
dog
its
not
in
the
same
league
as
something
like
dortmunder
gold
but
drinks
very
well
and
is
worth
the
checking
out
recommended
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
flavor
is
slightly
fruity
with
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
corn
and
pair
aromas
bottle
brought
back
from
nasville
a
little
more
exciting
body
and
flavors
than
your
typical
pale
lager
not
an
incredibly
amount
of
complexity
or
individuality
in
this
beer
however
fairly
meh
but
not
offputting
pairs
well
with
food
easy
to
ignore
not
something
youd
drink
for
the
sake
of
the
beer
itself
but
sessionable
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
certainly
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
very
cloying
and
rather
unbalanced
in
flavors
and
feel
most
adjusts
are
far
superior
to
this
with
a
much
lower
cost
and
actually
a
better
taste
i
will
likely
not
come
back
to
this
brew
d
goes
down
easily
enough
rather
quaffable
nothing
offputting
not
even
in
the
slightest
however
there
is
nothing
memorable
or
even
slightly
remarkable
about
this
offering
it
is
a
simple
straightforward
pedestrian
lager
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
in
and
off
itself
but
its
not
necessarily
what
all
bas
are
hoping
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
a
beer
like
this
but
its
not
something
i
would
stock
regularly
nor
recommend
try
it
decide
for
yourself

for
a
simple
lager

overall
decent
thanks
to
tone77
for
this
beer
lagers
are
no
longer
my
favorite
style
but
they
have
their
place
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
one
this
is
an
enjoyable
one
not
all
that
different
form
your
standard
bmc
but
still
a
better
representation
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
labeled
as
a
dortmunderexport
style
in
having
several
dorts
i
have
found
this
brew
to
be
the
least
fitting
into
the
dortmunder
style
this
beer
if
served
to
me
in
place
of
a
domestic
light
beer
without
my
knowledge
could
probably
dupe
me
the
beer
does
slightly
have
more
flavor
in
the
way
of
hops
in
comparison
to
u
s
light
beer
and
would
fit
more
intoand
be
highly
ranked
in
that
style
this
beer
is
a
decent
lager
i
am
not
sure
if
i
have
ever
had
a
dortmunder
before
but
this
is
alright
could
use
a
boost
in
the
flavor
department
but
the
flavor
that
is
there
isnt
bad
this
is
a
decent
light
alcohol
easy
drinking
lager
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
body
with
a
2
white
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
of
hops
and
barley
the
taste
is
clean
and
the
hops
comes
through
very
nice
the
balance
of
hops
and
barley
is
very
nice
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
goes
down
nice
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
drinkable
o
this
was
a
very
good
will
brewed
lager
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
on
my
next
visit
pours
a
pale
gold
small
cap
of
rocky
white
head
decent
retention
scent
is
light
and
contains
some
clean
and
fresh
malt
notes
backed
by
faintly
grassy
and
earthy
hop
notes
taste
is
quite
light
and
clean
with
some
minimal
maltyness
and
faintly
stale
hop
bite
light
bodied
bubbly
a
little
step
above
a
macro
comparable
to
a
decent
import
grain
and
bread
like
smells
which
completely
dominated
the
entire
profile
from
the
first
moment
you
took
a
whiff
of
it
this
was
not
a
bad
thing
in
fact
it
was
kinda
what
i
would
be
looking
for
in
the
style
and
it
really
came
off
with
the
aroma
of
a
classic
german
lager
bigtime
bready
and
malt
heavy
lager
this
just
did
not
mess
around
and
came
right
at
you
nice
light
profile
that
was
just
full
of
bready
grains
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
sort
of
twang
to
it
that
was
hard
to
place
but
was
a
little
different
the
finish
was
great
a
nice
big
kick
of
hops
to
finish
it
off
a
little
bready
with
some
up
front
hop
bitterness
followed
by
a
malty
ride
into
a
clean
if
a
little
sweet
finish
a
little
floral
hop
aroma
overall
a
pretty
solid
lager
from
these
guys
pairs
well
with
clams
and
scallops
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
aroma
of
spent
grains
and
floral
hops
in
the
taste
mild
cracker
like
yeast
white
bread
even
balance
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
refreshing
light
good
for
the
summer
heat
waves
nothing
remarkable
but
absurdly
easy
to
drink
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
clean
biscuity
and
tasty
overall
a
good
clean
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
very
lacking
in
flavor
or
character
it
has
that
nice
lager
crispness
but
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
real
flavor
its
not
overtly
offensive
but
something
really
needs
to
be
done
to
up
the
flavor
here
in
the
meantime
dont
bother
take
your
money
somewhere
else
there
are
better
lagers
out
there
d
one
is
enough
d
a
nice
dort
but
there
is
such
a
wonderful
selection
here
i
wouldnt
see
my
self
passing
up
a
new
offering
just
to
get
this
and
with
almost
brewpub
only
exclusivity
it
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability
d
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
it
doesnt
have
the
unpleasant
aftertaste
that
most
macro
lagers
have
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
crisp
aftertaste
that
keeps
you
begging
for
more
d
an
average
lager
in
the
straightup
allmalt
american
lager
category
similar
to
yengling
lager
i
generally
go
for
heavier
beers
but
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
lager
not
outstanding
in
any
way
but
a
nice
drinkable
lager
this
was
a
recent
botmc
arrival
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
an
earthy
lager
malt
with
grape
accents
and
a
very
pilsner
noble
hop
aroma
very
pilsnerlike
the
hint
of
grapes
is
also
very
pilsnerlike
pours
to
a
golden
lager
colour
with
a
bright
white
head
made
up
of
multi
sized
bubbles
taste
is
sweet
and
skunky
like
a
classic
lager
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
is
sufficient
but
not
overdone
reviewing
this
for
what
it
is
a
lager
it
is
quite
good
great
noble
hop
undertone
light
bitterness
and
a
good
flavor
i
was
bracing
myself
for
a
pretty
weak
middling
lager
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
some
nice
twists
along
the
way
cant
say
its
a
real
standout
in
my
mind
but
there
were
definitely
some
things
about
it
that
impressed
me
an
easy
drinker
tasty
i
could
easily
spend
an
evening
with
this
one
very
light
tasting
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
half
way
decent
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
overall
pretty
thin
tasting
has
some
straw
notes
with
a
mild
light
malt
taste
ceratinly
a
bit
of
a
spicy
hop
note
reminded
me
more
of
a
pilsner
with
the
slight
hop
aroma
and
finish
i
guess
i
was
looking
for
more
of
a
richer
malt
flavor
but
still
it
was
a
very
refreshing
lager
seasonable
summer
time
lager
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
certainly
consider
this
for
a
session
brew
overall
a
decent
selection
d
a
reasonable
lager
although
i
would
not
put
it
in
the
dortmunder
category
personally
it
fits
more
in
the
straightup
allmalt
lager
category
for
me
d
a
very
nice
very
sessionable
lager
its
nice
to
find
a
clean
light
tasting
lager
that
has
some
flavor
well
done
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
slightly
sweet
taste
is
crisp
some
malts
a
touch
of
sweetness
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
a
dortmunder
hmmm
wouldnt
have
pegged
it
as
such
more
of
a
mainstream
lager
perhaphs
leaning
a
bit
more
than
average
to
the
malt
side
a
touch
of
caramel
to
the
malt
moderate
hopping
and
the
finish
a
little
sweet
overall
it
was
well
puttogether
and
the
flavors
all
complimentary
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
kind
of
weird
honestly
i
know
very
little
about
this
style
its
maltiness
might
be
too
much
for
some
people
its
respectable
d
this
was
a
drinkable
lager
that
i
enjoyed
and
would
drink
again
drinkability
i
could
have
three
or
four
very
good
for
the
style
i
like
the
mix
of
sweet
and
hoppiness
this
tastes
like
a
maltier
pilsner
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
very
slight
hop
and
sweet
malt
and
slighty
earthiness
fits
the
style
of
a
dortmunderexport
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
yeast
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
earthiness
and
grain
overall
a
well
blended
nice
bodied
beer
that
is
much
smoother
and
drinkable
as
it
warms
ill
certainly
be
coming
back
to
this
although
its
not
my
normal
style
a
fine
effort
by
appalachian
a
solid
feel
light
bodied
but
substantial
smooth
crisp
clean
i
sound
like
a
beer
commercial
i
like
this
beer
in
all
its
simplicity
easy
drinker
good
all
around
lager
d
well
good
since
it
is
so
close
to
water
but
really
there
is
not
enough
here
for
me
to
buy
this
again

i

a

out

and
not
the
proper
formula
i
would
say
appalachian
mountain
lager
is
a
clear
golden
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fade
and
leaves
some
ok
lacing
it
carries
smells
of
light
grain
and
lemon
its
very
light
bodied
a
little
watery
but
smooth
the
flavor
is
mellow
with
a
soft
wooden
bitterness
it
tastes
fresh
and
its
very
drinkable
my
brother
picked
this
up
at
the
brewery
i
think
and
brought
it
here
poured
a
nice
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of

very
neutral
with

this
is
very

boring
this
is
about
as
mediocre
as
you
can
get
this
is
nothing
i
would
recommend
and
something
i
would
never
pay
for
again
overall
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
i
just
can
not
get
over
the
fruity
taste
it
has
which
was
not
advertised
on
the

d
relatively
clean
with
some
bitterness
but
sweetness
lingers
d
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
too
impressive
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
to
cool
off
but
i
cannot
say
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
pored
a
clear
yellowish
color
aroma
is
quite
faint
slight
hop
odor
other
than
that
nothing
i
could
really
pick
up
very
nice
light
refreshing
lager
sweet
malty
taste
with
a
hint
of
light
hoppy
bitterness
finish
made
this
good
drinkability
is
very
high
with
this
one
its
just
nice
pours
a
toasted
grain
color
with
an
average
tight
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
slight
cap
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
i
pick
up
some
bready
doughy
malt
and
a
light
hop
spice
the
taste
is
of
a
thick
honey
malt
with
some
grain
and
stale
hop
flavors
has
an
interesting
thick
yet
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
the
feel
is
moderate
and
well
carbonated
finishes
with
a
honey
sweetness
good
balance
drinks
very
easy
a
good
brew
flavors
dont
standout
but
there
arent
any
real

flavors
good
brew
to
kick
back
and
session
pours
a
clean
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small

and
also
a
sweet
maltiness
a
small
bitter
and
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
sessionish
lager
quite
balanced
and
fresh
drinkability
is
ok
its
really
easy
to
drink
but
its
a
bit
bland
and
uninteresting
deasily
couldput
down
a
six
pack
of
this
because
of
the
smoothness
it
isnt
rough
to
drink
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
coors
light
with
class
d
not
an
easy
drinker
i
was
disappointed
in
the
taste
after
hearing
how
good
it
was
supposed
to
be
di
have
had
good
versions
and
bad
versions
of
this
this
particular
version
was
not
very
good
had
it
better
in
the
bottle
than
on
tap
d
one
of
abcs
easiest
to
quaff
pretty
straightforward
and
according
to
style
could
be
a
litter
cleaner
in
the
finish
but
overall
its
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
used
my
new
sam
adams
glass
for
this
beer
cool
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
white
head
that
dissipates
except
for
a
white
cap
that
laces
down
the
glass
light
grainy
aroma
flavor
was
malt
accented
with
some
decent
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
refreshing
and
especially
suited
for
summer
quaffing
full
body
with
a
nice
substantial
mouthfeel
a
great
introduction
for
macro
drinkers
into
craft
beer
it
is
refreshing
with
a
light
mouthfeel
and
light
flavor
in
fact
not
alot
of
flavor
to
speak
of
but
enough
i
wouldnt
want
something
heavy
on
a
hot
day
like
this
has
a
nice
finish
and
even
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
bite
at
the
end
that
doesnt
last
i
like
that
pretty
much
par
for
abc
stuff
as
its
light
and
nonoffensive
highly
drinkable
id
say
but
sadly
i
only
have
5
left
guess
ill
have
to
have
a
pbr
in
between
haha
i
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
drinks
our
american
macros
ie
bud
miller
coors
etc
its
comparable
but
better
than
all
of
those
nice
lager
especially
for
the
hot
summer
days
go
for
it
you
wont
regret
it
hell
i
havent
met
a
beer
i
didnt
drink
yet
cheers
my
friends
drinkability
a
beer
that
one
could
sit
and
drink
one
after
the
other
if
i
wasnt
alone
out
of
state
and
had
to
drive
in
the
rain
great

to
be

in

by
the

somewhat
dry
great
example
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
with
just
enough
character
to
not
be
boring
but
at
the
same
time
be
accessible
to
the
masses
wow
it
seems
like
i
drank
this
one
in
seconds
could
be
dangerous
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
overall
an
impressive
lager
id
especially
love
to
pair
it
with
pizza
i
dont
know
whats
dortmund
or
export
about
this
beer
tasted
like
a
plain
old
american
allmalt
to
me
not
that
thats
necessarily
bad
but
this
doesnt
taste
any
different
to
me
reminds
me
of
the
older
saranac
allmalt
lager
a
slight
grainy
and
biscuity
quality
with
sweet
grains
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
pleasant
and
washes

just
fine
on

thin

noticed
in
the
pint

was
extremely
grainy
and
sugary
sweet
with
some
fresh
cut
grass
and
hay
overtones
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
too
slick
and
oily
undercarbonated
for
a

not
enough
fizz
here
taste
of
slightly
sour
grain
light
malts
fresh
baked
white

lemon
and
grass
overall
quite
a
sweet

quick
with

and
the
water
gap
wheat
great
job
artie
t
and
crew
drinkability
even
though
the
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
i
found
this
to
have
a
decent
drinkability
from
a
refreshing
standpoint
not
a
beer
to
search
for
but
maybe
worth
a
look
if
confronted
with
a
limited
beer
selection
brewpubs
that
bottle
sell
their
own
beer
are
kickass
and
i
totally
want
to
be
supportive
but
this
beer
is
just
not
very
good
i
cant
say
im
disappointed
since
i
didnt
expect
much
in
the
first
place
but
there
is
certainly
room
for
improvement
darker
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
inviting
not
much
carbonation
though
a
nice
suprisingly
fulled
bodied
lager
crisp
and
refeshing
almost
a
little
creamy
pretty
decent
brew
and
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
i
got
it
at
the
brew
zoo
during
a
visit
to
altoona
as
part
of
a
four
pack
sort
of
an
overshadowed
brewery
perhaps
but
most
seem
to
be
good
ground
level
brews
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
head
that
faded
rather
quickly
the
smell
was
slightly
malty
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
was
very
crisp
and
clean
no
strange
flavors
a
hint
of
hop
flavor
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
not
as
much
malt
as
i
expected
to
taste
i
could
definately
sit
back
and
enjoy
a
6pack
of
this
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
it
had
the
refreshing
sort
of
characteristic
to
it
but
overall
the
beer
was
not
something
that
blew
me
away
oddly
it
seemed
the
first
bottle
was
much
better
than
all
those
that
came
after
though
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
that
very
very
clear
and
a
nice
golden
color
low
aromanot
much
there
really
good
malty
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
to
it
it
gives
it
just
a
snap
of
flavor
very
clean
in
the
finish
nice
body
for
the
style
goes
down
easy
and
quite
smooth
great
beer
for
the
non
micro
drinker
or
someone
who
is
scared
of
having
a
beer
in
a
brew
pub
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
an
above
average
lager
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
american
representation
of
the
dortmunder
style
presented
a
medium
golden
color
with
white
puffy
head
smell
is
a
bit
malty
with
a
slight
background
sweetness
taste
is
slightly
of
citrus
with
a
tangy
background
aftertaste
is
crisp
and
a
bit
bitter
and
very
enjoyable
im
normally
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
but
this
a
better
than
most
this
arrived
with
a
nice
white
head
but
it
quickly
evaporated
to
wispiness
although
it
continued
to
bubble
with
co2
it
was
deep
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
lightly
sweet
nose
it
had
a
light
mouthfeel
with
a
light
combination
of
hops
and
malt
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
more
malty
but
it
was
still
light
in
its
flavor
profile
having
said
all
of
that
i
still
feel
that
it
was
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
and
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
candidate
light
gold
in
color
with
a
mediumsized
respectable
white
head
moderate
leaningto
light
in
carbonation
this
is
a
nicelooking
brew
sweet
restrained
grain
and
malt
aroma
with
just
a
thin
bit
of
hop
presence
the
taste
is
nicely
balancedsweet
and
caramel
with
biscuit
offset
by
a
moderate
bitterness
that
begins
in
the
midtaste
finishes
soft
and
lingering
with
the
balance
very
notable
if
anything
this
brew
might
slide
a
little
toward
the
too
sweet
side
but
its
still
nicely
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
and
soft
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
brews
drinkability
of
course
something
as
smooth
as
this
gets
a
high
drinkability
overalldissapointing
it
doesnt
taste
very
good
almost
tastes
thrown
together
and
ruins
what
looked
to
be
a
promising
beer
hope
appalacian
gets
their
act
together
on
this
one
sometime
has
a
mouthfeel
between
light
and
medium
i
think
i
would
have
scored
this
beer
higher
if
i
were
enjoying
it
on
the
boat
in
the
middle
of
a
hot
summer
day
after
living
the
last
few
weeks
on
bold
winter
warmers
and
imperial
everythings
it
just
seems
a
bit
muted
definitely
the
best
starting
lager
that
ive
ever
had
at
a
brewpub
when
i
normally
try
their
starting
beer
im
nonplussed
or
downright
disappointed
but
this
is
an
exception
very
nice
and
flavorful
dortmunder
and
one
id
love
to
have
again
a
nice
lager
but
wish
the
carb
was
toned
down
just
a
little
and
the
flavor
cranked
up
a
tad
drinkability
awesome
this
beer
is
the
perfect
session
beer
absolutely
its
not
interesting
its
not
a
masterpiece
its
just
an
absolutely
solid
and
easy
drinking
lager
very
nice
id
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
lagers
out
there
i
managed
to
get
my
one
friend
who
hates
beer
to
drink
this
and
now
shes
a
big
fan
of
lagers
due
to
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
nice
clear
pale
color
to
it
with
a
nice
mild
aroma
it
has
a
mild
malt
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
make
it
and
over
all
good
lager
a
clear
golden
body
teems
with
vibrant
carbonation
beneath
a
full
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
retention
is
fair
and
maintains
a
wide
collar
and
leaves
some
minor
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
expresses
a
combination
of
lightly
grainy
malt
and
citrusy
lemon
rind
and
lightly
floralgrassy
hops
its
not
bold
but
its
fresh
clean
and
welcoming
the
body
is
mediumlight
and
its
fine
and
slightly
zesty
carbonation
is
more
airy
on
the
palate
than
crisp
the
flavor
is
more
grainy
than
the
nose
leads
you
to
believe
and
the
hops
are
unfortunately
subdued
a
delicate
bitterness
balances
its
cereallike
maltiness
well
but
somehow
leaves
it
lackluster
it
finishes
fairly
short
and
dry
although
some
grain
tends
to
build
on
the
palate
as
it
warms
served
as
part
of
a
sampler
tray
at
their
brewery
this
is
a
highly
quaffable
beer
more
of
a
malt
and
grainy
body
than
any
macros
i
can
think
of
this
beer
is
golden
and
very
clear
with
a
thin
head
slight
whiff
of
grains
and
bits
of
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
same
hops
leave
a
pleasant
bitterness
behind
as
the
beer
finishes
clean
and
crisp
refreshing
and
slightly
bitter
yet
smooth
i
was
impressed
with
virtually
all
aspects
of
this
brew
it
poured
a
clear
straw
color
nice
head
tight
bands
of
carbonation
and
good
lacing
there
was
a
subtle
but
tempting
malty
scent
and
strong
hop
aroma
even
a
floral
mix
of
aromas
was
perceived
almost
making
it
smells
more
like
an
ale
the
taste
started
out
with
a
sweet
maltiness
followed
by
a
smooth
transition
to
a
mellow
bitterness
after
the
swallow
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
medium
body
had
a
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
very
nice
the
mountain
lager
was
an
enjoybale
very
drinkable
beer
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
it
on
tap
this
is
a
great
everyday
notsoheavy
or
alcoholic
brew
making
it
a
great
session
beer
i
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
and
it
never
lets
me
down
good
solid
summer
beer
when
i
just
want
to
have
something
light
and
great
tasting
when
brought
to
the
table
you
notice
that
the
head
is
densethick
it
is
goldcooper
in
color
a
malt
slight
sweet
aroma
with
some
hops
the
flavor
reflects
the
aroma
but
has
a
slight
fruit
hop
appeal
finishes
off
pretty
well
with
malt
not
what
i
expected
slightly
different
then
others
in
its
class
medium
amber
in
color
with
golden
notes
hoppy
nose
with
slight
hint
of
roasted
malt
thick
bubbly
head
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
slightly
less
body
than
others
in
its
category
smooth
and
easy
drinkable
with
a
satisfying
finish
while
this
certainly
is
not
an
explosive
or
big
fullflavored
craft
beer
the
likes
of
which
we
normally
praise
around
here
this
is
an
excellent
offering
for
its
style
and
highly
recommended
as
a
fun
trainingwheels
brew
as
their
winter
seasonal
offering
oreven
betterin
place
of
a
cold
wet
macrobrew
should
the
need
arise
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
summer
day
its
a
damn
good
beer
my
favorite
from
shiner
a
beer
to
be
gulped
but
enjoyed
for
its
solid
pleasing
taste
pours
a
medium
to
dark
golden
color
with
a
fairly
decent
amount
of
white
foam
on
top
on
the
nose
hoppy
slightly
grainy
with
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
on
the
palate
light
bodied
refreshing
and
moderately
carbonated
with
herbal
hops
and
a
heavier
pilsnerlike
character
drinkable
and
not
much
more
first
taste
is
impressive
but
after
a
bit
it
becomes
watery
and
almost
bland
notes
there
is
not
much
to
say
here
frost
does
everything
well
for
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
not
sure
if
the
diacetyl
means
these
are
aging
a
bit
but
they
go
down
easily
an
excellent
example
of
dortmunder
there
are
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
that
are
excellent
after
trying
most
of
shiners
new
beers
and
being
very
disappointed

i
am
very
surprised
that
this
is
a
well
made
beer
put
live
oak
or
great
lakes
in
front
and
this
is
considered
a
great
lager
something
i
highly
recommend
so
the
appearance
ya
it
looks
pretty
good
id
say
the
smell
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
perhaps
taste
a
bit
disappointing
really
not
a
lot
going
on
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
but
drinkable
for
sure
give
it
a
try
it
might
be
right
up
your
alley
plus
the
abv
is
not
too
high
or
too
low
maybe
even
just
right
shiner
frost
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
gold
standard
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
but
its
still
a
tremendous
achievement
for
spoetzl
brewery
is
this
their
best
beer
yeah
it
just
might
be
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
went
well
with
some
jarlsberg
swiss
cheese
highly
recommended
d
easily
drinkable
a
nice
malty
beer
with
fair
finish
not
to
light
not
too
heavy
drinkability
id
definitely
have
this
one
again
but
given
its
warming
characteristic
it
isnt
wellsuited
for
houston
summers
im
not
usually
terribly
impressed
by
new
beers
since
i
cant
afford
anything
too
fancy
but
this
was
only
7
and
its
one
of
my
new
favorites
im
gonna
buy
it
up
before
it
disappears
pours
a
coppery
golden
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
disipates
leaving
only
moderate
lacing
decent
grainy
aroma
though
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
bit
more
of
a
hops
presence
taste
is
a
bit
weak
though
what
was
there
was
enjoyable
again
there
was
a
grainy
presence
that
might
have
been
better
complemented
with
more
hops
presence
mouthfeel
was
decent
enough
but
not
really
memorable
in
any
respect
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
expect
a
bit
more
from
this
brewery
d
a
bit
dry
and
hard
for
my
taste
its
going
down
slow
i
also
dont
understand
shiner
calling
this
a
hearty
fullbodied
ale
when
dortmunder
exports
are
by
definition
mediumbodied
at
their
fullest
still
not
a
bad
beer
though
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
between
malt
and
hops
just
a
little
dry
but
just
a
little
sweet
i
like
this
very
thirstquenching
must
seek
out
others
of
this
style
d
easy
to
drink
and
has
more
flavor
than
typical
pale
lagers
a
bit
stronger
than
id
like
for
a
session
beer
but
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
so
its
easy
to
get
carried
away
drinkability
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
quaffable
refreshing
fröst
is
simply
a
tasty
little
lager
finally
had
a
chance
to
try
this
new
beer
from
the
folks
at
shiner
its
on
the
hoppy
side
which
i
like
refreshing
which
i
like
affordable
which
i
really
like
highly
recommended
and
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
should
shiner
decides
to
keep
it
available
at
that
time
but
just
in
case
they
dont
i
plan
on
stocking
up
especially
as
the
store
i
bought
it
at
has
it
on
sale
having
this
beer
with
chicken
burgers
btw
great
combo
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
lighter
beer
that
is
worth
pounding
down
several
of
over
a
long
period
of
time
id
absolutely
drink
another
of
these
seems
like
a
great
hot
summer
day
beer
after
a
softball
game
or
mowing
the
lawn
if
you
really
think
about
it
there
are
not
many
beers
of
this
style
available
in
the
usa
this
is
a
good
beer
but
just
one
step
down
from
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
this
one
seems
a
little
less
hoppier
and
just
a
little
more
watered
down
still
it
is
good
to
have
another
example
of
this
style
to
drink
pours
a
clear
golden
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
hop
earthiness
grain
and
slight
vanilla
fits
the
style
of
a
dortmunder
export
beer
mouth
feel
is
slightly
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
slight
hop
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
good
feel
and
a
decent
blend
the
hop
addition
nicely
cuts
the
sweetness
this
is
well
crafted
to
the
guides
set
for
the
style
and
the
best
of
the
shiner
series
in
my
opinion
not
a
style
you
find
very
often
poured
into
a
5
liter

could
see
mylef
drinkin
this
out
tin
the
yard
over
the
spring
and
summer
drinks
pretty
easy
a
solid
shot
at
the
style
id
happily
drink
a
few
on
a
warm
summers
day
d
little
aftertaste
very
satisfying
gets
better
as
you
drink
its
good
beer
yeah
it
taste
similar
to
coors
to
me
i
notice
little
or
no
hops
but
some
malt
very
attractive
labeling
and
packaging
bought
a
dozen
at
heb
for
11
99
enjoyed
them
all
they
go
quickly
not
much
more
to
say
its
frosty
goodness
from
shiner
texas
agree
it
may
be
a
tad
sweet
if
allowed
to
warm
a
bit
d
you
could
do
worse
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
though
im
not
sure
this
brew
is
available
in
springsummer
its
not
bad
but
not
entirely
flavorful
either
d
its
sad
to
say
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
shiner
a
decent
enough
lager
but
not
something
id
be
interested
in
having
again
dortmunders
are
rarely
produced
by
american
micros
because
theyre
not
exciting
and
are
all
about
good
balance
this
is
a
welldone
one
by
a
brewer
known
for
as
many
misses
as
hits
still
i
cant
imagine
buying
it
very
often
dortmunder
just
isnt
exciting
overall
an
excellent
offering
by
shiner
i
do
recommend
this
one
d
another
lager
from
shiner
that
fails
to
really
shine
but
does
provide
a
lasting
impression
why
is
this
a
winter
brew
so
we
get
bock
year
round
but
a
refreshing
blonde
ale
in
the
winter
i
dont
know
about
that
on
the
other
hand
i
enjoyed
this
brew
for
what
it
is
for
my
money
better
than
dortmunder
export
or
a
rock
bottom
golden
ale
or
any
of
the
american
standard
lagers
for
that
matter
i
wonder
how
much
it
cost
them
to
brew
this
and
why
couldnt
the
other
big
companies
hit
this
standard
of
quality
i
think
a
lot
of
people
could
enjoy
this
potential
gateway
brew
d
high
i
could
go
through
a
bunch
of
these
worth
having
if
you
see
it
i
wouldnt
trade
for
it
unless
youre
a
lager
junkie
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
above
average
which
works
well
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
lighter
beer
with
some
good
flavors
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
its
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
d
a
decent
beer
that
drinks
alright
the
aftertaste
could
maybe
use
just
a
bit
of
work
spoetzl
brewerys
take
on
the
dortmunder
style
is
an
outstanding
drinkable
beer
a
frothy
tawny
gold
colored
pour
that
is
a
gentle
reminder
that
beer
was
an
important
refuge
to
the
working
class
in
this
case
the
dortmund
coal
miners
who
probably
found
this
style
of
brew
to
be
not
only
a
throat
cutter
but
also
also
an
elixir
of
restorative
malts
frosty
goodness
throughout
the
straight
forward
flavors
complimented
by
an
outstanding
semidry
finish
cheers
lightmedium
bodied
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
maybe
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
but
still
an
enjoyable
lager
in
any
case
this
one
is
very
close
to
the
style
malt
forward
like
a
helles
yet
fuller
in
body
this
brewery
should
consider
this
as
a
year
round
offering
i
am
confused
that
the
bottle
states
this
is
a
seasonal
ale
this
is
a
lager
verdict
easily
identifiable
as
a
shiner
beer
frost
is
bright
and
happy
though
ultimately
forgettable
a
solid
winter
seasonal
for
the
shiner
faithful
though
nothing
worthwhile
for
the
rest
of
us
d
another
ho
hum
average
beer
from
shiner
on
the
plus
side
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
unexciting
or
note
worthy
taste
has
a
pleasant
balance
of
sweet
and
toffee
malts
that
are
followed
by
a
quick
carbonation
and
hop
palate
scrubbing
smooth
and
creamy
feeling
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
mild
soapy
taste
that
is
really
the
only
minor
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
shiner
has
done
a
great
job
on
this
one
and
it
is
in
my
top
three
or
four
beers
they
have
made
its
a
great
value
to
boot
as
i
am
on
my
second
twelvepack
of
it
since
coming
out
in
early
january
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
lightly
coarse
in
texture
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
just
feel
like
its
a
kind
of
bastardized
version
of
the
style
just
like
shiner
bock
is
a
bastardized
bock
still
its
a
nice
clean
lager
with
a
little
bit
of
character
not
sure
how
this
gets
such
high
ratings
but
this
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
higher
rated
beers
of
this
style
such
as
dortmunder
gold
this
is
just
a
basic
lager
targeted
to
bmc
drinkers
packaged
as
craft
beer
the
brewers
from
gambrinus
cleverly
try
to
market
this
brand
as
a
germanczech
style
beer
perhaps
they
should
visit
these
areas
to
see
what
the
beer
tastes
like
cause
none
of
their
brews
are
it
md
nothing
really
stands
out
except
for
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
the
style
its
clean
and
very
sessionable
you
can
drink
alot
of
this
and
not
get
bored
cheers
notes
good
example
of
the
style
though
not
my
favorite
overall
not
your
beer
if
you
like
a
lot
of
aggressive
flavor
however
it
follows
the
dortmunder
standard
pretty
well
and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
d
i
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
but
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
more
interesting
than
the
tx
staple
shiner
bock
frost
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
or
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
those
looking
for
a
light
straightforward
lager
that
does
a
lot
more
tastewise
than
the
macro
staples
d
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavortaste
department
but
it
is
very
light
and
drinkable
i
was
looking
for
something
under
6
abv
and
this
did
the
job
but
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
my
attention
a
good
session
beer
in
my
book
solidly
malty
for
the
winter
months
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
muted
than
the
aroma
unfortunately
because
the
flavor
that
is
present
is
quite
good
crisp
crackery
german
pilsner
malts
on
the
front
of
the
palate
are
followed
by
a
combination
of
sulfur
minerals
and
hops
traces
of
grassy
bitterness
linger
into
the
finish
as
this
dortmunder
dries
the
back
of
the
palate
light
body
with
a
good
carbonation
level
not
exactly
fullbodied
as
the
neck
label
claims
but
there
is
very
little
in
the
way
of
offflavors
or
undesirable
consistencies
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
little
more
than
my
reviews
score
suggested
not
sure
if
fröst
fits
as
a
winter
seasonal
but
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
my
sixpack
d
a
very
drinkably
beer
light
and
crisp
throughly
enjoyable
possibly
my
new
favorite
shiner
product
opinion
well
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
am
surely
going
to
drink
the
sixpack
that
i
got
i
am
not
sure
how
much
more
i
will
be
buying
the
price
was
reasonable
7
so
well
see
what
happens
in
the
future
it
is
worth
a
shot
but
you
may
want
to
split
some
with
a
buddy
or
two
so
you
can
make
up
your
own
mind
this
seasonal
brew
is
very
good
it
is
best
served
ice
cold
to
accent
its
strong
malt
and
seasonal
elements
that
really
put
you
in
the
mood
for
the
great
texas
summers
ahead
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
shiners
limited
brew
runs
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
adjuncts
kill
it
a
very
sessional
beer
i
believe
i
will
be
opening
another
another
fun
offering
from
the
boys
at
spoetzl
always
a
pleasure
checking
out
their
seasonal
and
oneoffs
kudos
will
enjoy
until
i
no
longer
can
this
year
body
is
on
the
light
side
and
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
with
just
a
slight
bitterness
throughout
the
mouth
upon
the
swallow
frost
is
a
very
very
drinkable
lager
one
id
reach
to
in
far
warmer
weather
its
also
the
first
dortmunder
style
beer
ive
ever
had
its
quite
a
bit
like
a
german
style
pilsener
though
maybe
a
little
breadier
im
not
sure
about
its
authenticity
though
either
way
definitely
worth
a
try
for
pilsener
fans
my
pour
resulted
in
almost
two
fingers
worth
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
good
biscuity
sweetness
that
made
my
mouth
begin
to
water
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
full
with
an
initial
wash
of
a
biscuity
malty
flavor
on
the
tongue
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
of
all
of
the
texas
beers
which
i
have
had
of
late
this
was
the
best
although
that
aint
sayin
much
finish
had
a
slight
hoppiness
that
did
not
overwhelm
the
sweetness
that
i
noticed
earlier
but
instead
acted
as
a
nice
compliment
i
could
easily
drink
another
of
these
first
seasonal
ive
tried
from
shiner
so
i
poured
this
puppy
into
a
12
oz
pint
glass
its
light
golden
in
color
with
has
a
completely
transparent
body
the
head
was
light
in
color
and
dissipated
quickly
the
taste
from
the
beer
was
a
nice
blend
kinda
high
on
carbonation
from
what
i
could
tell
i
enjoyed
the
bite
the
beer
had
it
almost
reminded
me
of
an
ipa
i
thought
it
was
a
really
good
beer
and
more
drinkable
than
most
beers
that
shiner
makes
definitely
sessionable
i
wouldnt
normally
label
this
style
of
beer
as
being
a
winter
seasonal
but
im
pretty
happy
with
it
overall
i
am
a
little
disappointed
to
hear
that
it
is
replacing
the
shiner
cheer
which
was
one
of
my
favorite
shiner
beers
good
stuff
shiner
d
i
think
this
is
an
all
around
solid
lager
it
has
some
nice
clean
aromas
and
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
pours
out
a
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
good
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
strong
malts
the
taste
has
alot
of
malt
taste
and
for
the
first
time
actually
tastes
the
way
the
back
label
on
a
shiner
says
there
is
a
sense
of
hops
on
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
not
watered
down
like
ive
come
to
expect
from
other
shiner
seasonals
overall
a
good
beer
from
shiner
much
better
than
their
other
xmas
seasonal
effot
the
xmas
beer
cheer
is
absolutely
awful
in
my
opinion
id
buy
and
drink
this
again
d
smooth
and
easy
drinking
p
s
package
design
is
the
shhhheeeeiii
its
not
going
to
give
great
lakes
dortmunder
a
run
for
its
money
but
its
a
good
beer
and
its
not
like
we
can
get
great
lakes
in
san
antonio
anyway
i
would
have
to
view
this
as
nothing
more
than
average
frankly
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
at
all
the
colour
is
quite
rich
and
it
is
smooth
but
besides
that
it
isnt
anything
too
special
there
was
practically
no
head
and
very
little
carbonation
i
suppose
for
the
price
i
paid
i
shouldnt
have
expected
it
to
be
too
outstanding
overall
ill
give
it
a
bit
above
average
o
eh
it
could
have
been
worse
given
the
circumstances
a
10
month
old
6
pack
of
a
notsohighlyrated
beer
so
ill
give
it
benefit
of
the
doubt
still
a
plain
and
uninspired
offering
my
pour
created
just
over
a
finger
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
of
typical
lagerlike
honeysweetness
and
grassy
hops
i
have
a
much
greater
appreciation
of
lagers
since
embarking
on
the
canquest
tm
and
this
one
was
making
my
mouth
water
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
just
like
the
nose
the
taste
was
grassy
honey
yum
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
refreshing
i
just
mowed
my
lawn
yesterday
for
potentially
the
last
time
this
year
and
this
would
have
made
a
fantastic
accompaniment
well
done
shiner
fyi
despite
what
the
label
says
this
is
not
an
ale
o
not
too
shabby
i
prefer
a
hoppy
beer
but
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
drinkable
nice
session
style
ale
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
slightly
sweet
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
malts
some
grains
kind
of
earthy
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
makes
a
good
session
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
sweet
grain
not
much
else
tastes
of
sweet
malt
with
a
few
hints
of
citrus
and
hops
very
well
balanced
carbonation
seems
a
little
light
but
it
is
fine
for
the
light
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
golden
color
with
a
brief
flash
head
and
no
real
lacing
mediumlight
honey
and
spice
aroma
clean
fresh
dry
lager
biscuit
malt
flavor
stays
solidly
in
tandem
with
clean
fresh
herbals
and
grassy
notes
through
and
through
crisply
carbonated
light
texture
and
body
so
why
does
the
bottle
label
say
the
word
ale
i
hate
it
when
packaging
lies
to
me
so
it
loses
some
overall
points
for
the
trickery
unfortunately
12oz
bottle
ive
had
this
one
a
few
times
now
so
about
time
for
a
review

floral
overtones
lemon
zest
crisp

nice

bite
at
the
onset
followed
by
a
faint

kick
refreshing
beer
that
really
hits
the
spot
each
and
every
time
o
my
first
dortmunder
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
style
interesting
and
palate
pleasing
a
great
spring
time
beverage
great
mesh
of
flavors
with
the
sweet
bitter
and
mild
bread
i
will
look
for
this
every
year
overall
like
most
shiner
beers
they
are
light
in
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
better
than
most
of
the
lagers
or
light
lagers
they
put
out
and
its
not
half
bad
better
than
all
bmc
overall
drinkability
quite
drinkable
wish
i
had
another
a
solidly
good
beer
but
is
it
an
ale
or
a
lager
label
says
ale
but
it
doesnt
look
that
different
than
the
dortmunder
lager
also
made
by
shiner
so
is
it
the
same
beer
or
a
different
one
cant
quite
tell
but
if
this
is
an
ale
i
think
its
mislabeled
and
instead
it
is
indeed
a
dortmunder
export
lager
all
that
potential
mislabel
aside
its
a
good
beer
that
goes
well
with
food
zucchini
cakes
in
this
case
and
i
suspect
it
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
other
food
or
all
by
itself
overall
nothing
special
here
its
drinkable
and
flavorful
enough
seems
like
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
during
some
springtime
yard
work

this
is
a
bland
but
thirst
quenching
beer
its
just
a
little
bit
better
than
the
usual
suspects
because
the
malt
and
hops
are
ever
so
slightly
more
detectable
o
very
nice
beer
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
good
abv
so
you
could
session
with
this
one
another
good
beer
from
shiner
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
color
with
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
sticked
around
for
a
little
while
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
brew
smells
like
bready
malt
and
fruit
apricots
it
tastes
like
breadygrainy
malt
dried
fruit
and
a
bit
of
herbal
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
bought
this
as
a
single
bottle
so
i
could
try
it
not
sure
if
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
or
not
but
i
would
try
this
again
in
the
future
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
it
has
some
refreshing
properties
and
goes
down
easily
o
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
quite
sessionable
enjoyable
and
certainly
not
one
i
would
turn
down
but
not
certain
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
overall
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
this
beer
bought
a
six
pack
for
5

this
is
an
easy
drinking
simple
sessionable
beer
overall
very
drinkable
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
more
of
these
on
a
warm
day
i
gave
this
beer
low
marks
due
to
the
phenolic
stale
taste
there
was
no
hops
flavor
to
speak
of
and
something
was
definitely
off
about
this
beer
i
have
contacted
shiner
with
the
pertinent
info
and
am
waiting
their
reply
this
may
be
a
bad
bottle
from
the
distributor
or
the
brewery
the
best
that
i
can
describe
this
initial
tasting
is
as

with

character
that

of

many
true
german
beers
was
well
balanced
with
some

at
the
end
would

this
was
an
interesting
beer
a
dortmunder
called
a
spring
ale
by
a
brewery
known
for
lagers
it
was
not
refreshing
or
zesy
enough
for
a
top
quality
dortmunder
though
it
is
worth
trying
there
are
better
interpretation
of
this
style
available
do
this
americanbrewed
lager
represents
an
unusual
style
for
a
domestic
beer
but
it
fails
to
distinguish
itself
as
such
malt
seems
not
so
much
like
an
apology
as
just
a
fumble
unremarkably
executed
this
could
be
a
dortmunder
or
five
other
eurostyle
lagers
without
a
more
accomplished
malt
expression
it
is
destined
to
bounce
around
splitting
time
between
categories
in
the
final
tally
its
a
difficult
beer
to
get
very
excited
about
overall
very
drinkable
brew
would
be
great
hanging
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
may
evening
i
would
drink
this
in
the
summer
time
if
they
offered
it
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
half
finger
head
which
recedes
to
nothing
there
is
also
litle
to
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
cereal
malts
and
a
hint
of
floral
the
taste
has
a
bready
malt
backbone
with
a
slight
taste
of
citrus
and
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
there
is
a
lager
yeast
taste
in
the
middle
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
very
true
to
the
style
and
is
an
easy
drink
pours
dark
golden
with
a
twofinger
length
white
head
that
retains
well
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
coming
up
the
glass
shiner
is
labeling
this
as
an
ale
in
the
dortmunderstyle
the
smell
of
malts
and
hops
dominates
flavors
of
slightly
sweet
malt
are
up
front
and
followed
by
some
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
its
clean
and
crisp
and
the
flavors
make
this
very
easy
to
drink
one
could
easily
session
this
overall
i
believe
shiner
has
a
success
here
with
this
dortmunderstyle
ale
its
not
spectacular
but
its
good
it
has
enough
drinkability
to
make
this
sessionable
and
one
could
enjoy
this
on
a
warm
spring
day
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
missing
something
in
the
flavor
department
but
otherwise
its
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
not
bad
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
its
not
incredibly
flavorful
and
a
bit
too
sweet
ill
probably
pass
in
the
future
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
reminded
me
of
an
american
macro
brew
yeah
it
was
a
beer
but
mostly
just
there
and
ultimately
forgettable
it
may
just
be
that
this
isnt
my
style
of
beer
pretty
good
overall
an
easy
drinking
nicely
balanced
great
session
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
so
maybe
that
is
why
this
seems
decent
enough
to
me
grainy
malt
profile
grassy
hop
feel
a
little
honeyish
sweetness
clean
bodied
drinks
nice
gl
dort
gold
this
is
not
but
it
sure
isnt
bad
either
not
a
lot
of
beers
of
this
style
around
which
makes
this
a
good
find
and
a
decent
price
one
of
shiners
better
efforts
maybe
the
twist
top
makes
it
easy
access
for
yard
work
o
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
but
if
i
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
dortmunder
it
comes
up
short
it
has
a
very
rich
palate
of
ale
esters
that
make
it
very
drinkable
just
dont
call
it
a
dortmunder
please
a
forgettable
entry
but
i
will
not
argue
the
merits
it
may
have
paired
with
the
family
lawn
mower
the
flavor
is
herbal
and
grassy
with
a
grainy
malt
base
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
finishes
spicy
crisp
light
and
semidry
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
smooth
an
excellent
refreshing
beer
overall
impression
for
my
first
time
enjoying
this
style
with
an
american
brewery
a
great
brew
from
shiner
spoetzl
well
balanced
and
had
nice
body
that
kept
this
beer
in
my
glass
for
a
longer
amount
of
time
than
other
lagers
would
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
style
if
you
havent
before
and
if
you
find
it
in
austriagermany
enjoy
many
o
good
drinkable
beer
made
me
wish
i
had
more
than
the
single
gifted
to
me
this
beer
is
one
more
in
a
line
of
pretty
good
shiner
seasonals
thanks
kosmos
into
a
pint
glass
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
golden
with
a
nice
display
of
bubbles
under
a
consistent
white
cap
a
zesty
and
crisp
mild
malt
aroma
of
lemongrass
fills
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
solid
floral
and
mildly
pungent
hop
character
thats
balanced
out
nicely
by
a
bright
bready
malt
flavor
and
honey
like
sweetness
flavorful
and
quenching
brew
for
the
spring
o
i
am
not
very
fond
of
this
beer
like
most
of
the
boring
shiner
beers
it
is
decent
but
not
worth
the
money
i
spent
on
it
just
a
pretty
boring
beer
to
me
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
wheat
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
nutty
grain
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
average
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
unfortunately
a
little
lackluster
in
my
personal
opinion
however
the
flavor
was
not
too
bad
and
was
quite
refreshing
i
could
probably
drink
this
one
again
if
given
to
me
but
doubt
i
could
see
myself
going
out
and
buying
a
6pack
on
my
own
half
finger
head
with
little
retention
and
no
lacing
on
a
clear
golden
body
aroma
is
a
little
light
with
mostly
breads
and
malt
more
of
the
same
in
the
finish
with
a
mild
bitter
hop
finish
light
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
somewhat
refreshing
i
have
only
had
one
or
two
from
this
genre
so
its
hard
to
accurately
judge
i
havent
tried
any
other
spring
beers
this
one
is
passable
for
something
id
bring
to
a
party
though
its
somewhat
like
shiner
bock
in
a
lot
of
ways
pretty
good
stuff
within
the
style
guidelines
its
definitely
good
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
substantial
frothy
head
collapses
under
its
own
weight
heavy
carbonation
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
subtle
but
balanced
flavor
follows
suit
in
its
subtlety
but
does
add
a
little
hop
and
tang
for
character
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
with
just
a
light
crispness
to
it
moving
into
a
smooth
feel
smells
of
yeast
hop
and
citrus
it
tasted
of
a
hefeweizen
with
a
citrus
body
with
a
slight
spicy
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
slightly
refreshing
overall
was
an
okay
dortmunder
compare
to
some
of
the
german
ones
i
had
i
might
taste
it
again
next
year
o
overall
a
classic
style
and
ahold
representation
of
it
the
flavor
has
a
little
to
much
slickness
to
start
with
some
toasted
malt
and
husky
grainy
flavors
which
seem
to
give
the
impression
of
adjuncts
with
not
much
depth
of
malt
the
vegetal
elements
and
slight
sweet
middle
w
hops
that
relax
pretty
soon
after
the
initial
taste
from
midpoint
on
the
flavor
becomes
more
grainy
and
hints
of
metallic
vegetal
become
more
noticeable
with
a
sweet
finish
overall
i
was
dissapointed
in
this
since
i
am
a
fan
of
the
dortmunder
style
and
wish
more
american
brewers
had
one
in
the
portfolio
but
this
is
lackluster
at
best
and
one
i
will
not
purchase
again
overall
nice
and
refreshing
taste
although
not
terribly
interesting
in
its
taste
span
rjt
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
my
first
foray
into
this
specific
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
in
comparison
to
other
lager
offerings
the
flavor
profile
seems
relatively
complex
however
thats
not
to
say
that
this
is
a
great
hot
day
type
beer
i
bought
this
as
part
of
mixed
sixer
but
i
might
have
to
get
a
sixer
of
just
this
now
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
without
a
doubt
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
tasted
great
on
an
80
degree
day
after
mowing
overall
surprising
experience
wouldnt
be
a
first
choice
to
recommend
to
friends
but
would
drink
it
if
i
was
invited
to
one
pours
a
medium
pale
gold
with
a
nice
big
head
that
settles
down
to
a
quarter
inch
layer
of
foam
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
behind
aroma
is
pleasant
but
lacks
both
strong
hops
and
malt
character
taste
is
a
bit
too
understated
though
does
have
some
enjoyable
hops
notes
but
no
real
malt
backbone
to
be
found
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
a
little
too
thin
for
my
liking
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
especially
considering
the
price
point
i
would
not
however
call
this
a
standout
example
of
the
style
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
straw
color
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
picked
up
some
malts
grass
bread
a
little
spice
on
the
nose
taste
was
like
the
smell
not
too
complicated
just
simple
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
slightly
carbonated
and
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
overall
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
will
definatly
drink
again
really
like
this
beer
it
has
been
a
decade
since
having
dabs
lager
and
this
reminded
me
of
it
right
away
pours
a
honeygolden
hue
with
white
head
nose
is
clean
with
some
soft
earthy
grains
and
light
herbal
note
palate
offers
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
some
cereal
and
certainly
minerally
flavors
that
flow
into
some
hop
herbal
qualities
finish
leaves
me
with
that
mineral
taste
light
sweetness
and
is
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tall
pilsner
good
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
good
lacing
throughout
the
glass
at
first
taste
had
a
nice
malty
breadiness
with
an
almost
cloying
sweet
finish
but
little
flavor
from
the
hops
almost
like
a
shiner
bock
but
as
i
enjoyed
this
while
playing
some
serious
black
ops
the
beer
had
time
to
warm
by
perhaps
10f
which
improved
the
taste
drastically
the
whole
body
became
noticeably
fuller
and
more
of
the
hoppy
flavor
came
through
a
great
spring
beer
from
shiner
and
definitely
better
than
that
grapefruit
ginger
dark
and
stormy
alcopop
they
called
a
beer
that
came
out
this
summer
overall
a
nice
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
beer
fine
cold
drink
for
a
hot
day
nothing
new
or
spectacular
for
the
style
just
a
soild
beer
and
east
to
enjoy
dr
dang
its
half
gone
just
figuring
out
the
smells
and
flavors
easy
drinking
pours
out
a
clear
dark
gold
minimal
head
and
lace
grassy
grainy
aroma
touches
of
honey
herbs
and
sugar
flavour
follows
suit
with
malty
breadiness
punctuated
with
some
herbal
grassiness
a
bit
of
adjunct
comes
through
but
not
in
a
bad
way
lager
like
mouthfeel
in
a
medium
body
relatively
simple
but
tasty
enough
to
be
consumable
especially
on
a
hot
day
overall
not
bad
about
run
of
the
mill
for
a
shiner
product
and
their
take
on
styles
a
fair
beer
for
a
fair
price
im
a
texan
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
compared
to
blue
moon
spring
blonde
wheat
and
some
others
this
is
more
beer
and
not
so
much
sugar
coated
beer
malty
and
bready
are
the
dominant
smells
in
this
palette
i
can
smell
a
faint
hint
of
sweet
earthy
tones
the
taste
has
a
nice
spice
to
it
with
a
maltydry
finish
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
that
i
quite
enjoy
it
is
not
a
very
complex
but
it
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
it
is
worth
checking
out
on
a
nice
spring
day
shiner
dortmunder
style
spring
ale
does
not
put
a
scare
into
the
very
best
versions
of
the
style
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
at
the
pinnacle
having
said
that
its
a
tasty
little
lager
that
has
some
character
and
that
should
be
mucho
enjoyable
alongside
most
foods
yearround
would
be
the
better
way
to
go
overall
a
pretty
well
rounded
lager
here
a
good
choice
for
warming
weather
conditions
d
very
drinkable
as
it
is
a
lighter
beer
but
it
is
definitely
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
overall
not
the
greatest
beer
ill
take
great
lakes
dortmunder
over
this
all
day
every
day
a
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
and
isnt
as
clean
and
crisp
as
id
like
i
love
well
crafted
lagers
but
this
one
falls
short
that
being
said
it
is
drinkable
at
least
o
good
representation
of
an
easydrinking
lager
beer
that
has
some
character
o
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
searching
for
better
than
average
easy
drinking
beer
and
this
dortmunder
does
offer
that
however
it
also
does
not
do
anything
to
distinguish
itself
in
an
already
crowded
market
very
drinkable
id
say
as
advertised
a
spring
ale
i
bought
a
six
pack
that
i
will
enjoy
on
warm
spring
days
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
light
yet
complex
and
very
much
a
step
above
most
of
the
shiner
beers
ive
had
ale
doesnt
matter
as
long
as
the
brewer
hits
the
mark
right
bright
and
clear
and
golden
quite
a
spicy
nose
but
light
on
the
malt
lagerlike
smoothness
and
crispness
take
the
palate
for
a
ride
thick
herbal
flavor
pushes
hard
against
a
dried
grassy
maltiness
that
soon
leads
to
a
spicy
dry
finish
this
beer
gets
right
to
the
point
complex
it
is
not
but
it
makes
up
for
that
with
a
clean
drive
to
be
as
drinkable
as
possible
we
were
too
impressed
with
that
drinkability
to
really
start
nitpicking
the
stylea
refreshing
spring
ale
it
will
be
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
light
body
make
up
the
feel
of
this
beer
aftertaste
is
well
balanced
i
couldnt
say
it
was
bitter
or
sweet
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
to
reach
for
in
the
spring
or
summer
pours
very
pale
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smells
faintly
of
grain
and
honey
which
immediately
got
my
attention
i
like
a
nice
crisp
beery
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
grainyness
to
it
and
this
fit
the
bill
perfectly
this
is
really
refreshing
you
can
taste
the
grain
and
honey
and
other
than
it
being
a
bit
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
this
is
a
great
brew
i
bet
i
would
love
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
doing
some
yard
work
poured
a
light
yellow
with
a
centimeter
head
that
remained
for
a
surprisingly
long
time
the
beer
flavour
was
imparted
mostly
by
the
hops
but
it
wasnt
overpowering
it
had
a
very
slight
pine
but
mostly
citrusy
taste
it
even
seemed
to
have
a
tiny
apricot
note
to
it
it
wasnt
particularly
bitter
it
was
too
much
hop
flavour
for
me
since
im
not
a
fan
of
hops
but
even
so
it
was
all
right
i
didnt
get
any
biscuity
malt
flavour
thats
supposed
to
be
an
element
of
this
style
so
perhaps
the
citrusy
hop
flavour
was
stronger
than
it
should
have
been
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
will
absolutely
buy
more
of
this
good
job
shiner
o
one
of
shinerspoetzls
better
products
ive
come
across
is
it
boundry
pushing
no
is
it
particularly
unique
not
really
but
its
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
easy
drinking
and
i
gotta
say
in
my
humble
opinion
shiner
would
do
well
adding
this
to
their
year
round
lineup
even
if
it
meant
dropping
one
of
their
current
year
rounds
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
goes
down
very
quickly
there
is
a
little
more
weight
than
a
typical
lawnmower
beer
this
is
would
be
a
great
spring
cleaning
beer
i
could
definitely
knock
a
few
of
these
back
after
cleaning
out
the
garage
would
not
be
my
first
choice
but
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
the
drawback
to
all
of
that
is
that
although
it
may
be
a
very
good
beer
and
really
quite
balanced
and
drinkable
it
lacks
a
bit
of
complexity
and
it
doesnt
raise
any
eyebrows
and
in
our
current
beer
climate
thats
unfortunately
whats
necessary
to
get
attention
and
keep
sales
going
even
in
germany
the
dortmunder
or
export
style
is
dying
out
it
just
falls
too
readily
between
the
munich
helles
and
southern
pils
styles
overall
however
its
a
great
style
that
should
really
be
appreciated
more
and
thankfully
shiner
has
put
out
a
really
good
version
of
it
not
the
best
brew
i
have
had
in
the
style
but
certianly
a
nice
brew
none
the
less
its
a
nice
summerspring
time
kind
of
brew
i
enjoyed
its
and
could
certianly
session
this
brew
without
a
problem
good
brew
i
will
have
to
try
a
few
others
from
this
brewery
as
well
dortmunder
style
spring
ale
did
somebody
just
make
up
a
style
anyways
im
guessing
this
is
basically
an
export
style
lager
brewed
with
an
ale
yeast
to
turn
it
out
quicker
and
not
hold
up
any
tank
space
pours
brilliant
golden
crystal
clear
completely
filtered
with
a
bright
white
foamy
head
that
sticks
arounds
and
coats
the
glass
at
the
same
time
aroma
has
pale
malts
a
bit
of
biscuitbread
dough
baking
complemented
by
an
assertive
herbalcitrusgrassy
hop
character
flavor
wise
it
has
a
honey
drizzled
biscuit
like
malt
profile
with
just
enough
hops
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
sweet
the
herbalcitrushay
like
hops
dry
out
the
sweet
bread
malt
base
so
that
things
just
seem
to
work
even
a
bit
of
mineral
watermetallic
edge
that
doesnt
offend
me
or
take
away
from
the
drinking
experience
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
smooth
natural
feeling
carbonation
level
overall
a
nice
drinking
springsummer
beer
that
will
wow
your
budmillercoors
friends
the
uber
beer
geek
will
say
this
tastes
like
elephant
piss
but
i
think
its
awesome
great
spin
on
a
classic
german
style
i
absolutely
loved
this
beer
it
lives
up
to
every
superlative
on
the
label
i
could
drink
bottle
after
bottle
and
not
get
sick
of
it
this
will
be
great
for
summer
and
i
plan
on
stocking
up
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
a
solid
effort
nonetheless
a
good
beer
for
the
spring
and
a
nice
refresher
interesting
though
that
shiners
winter
seasonal
as
is
its
new
spring
brew
are
both
dortmunders
o
a
good
beer
for
drinking
in
front
of
the
tube
and
the
honey
taste
does
lead
my
mind
to
spring
so
ill
take
it
its
a
descent
spring
brew
has
some
flavor
and
is
refreshing
i
like
the
hop
character
tastegrain
faint
honey
bread
buttered
saltine
cracker
very
easygoing
clean
and
quaffable
a
nice
springtime
session
brew
good
flavor
following
the
aroma
solid
lager
flavor
that
is
definitely
enhanced
by
the
citrus
some
notice
of
malty
grain
as
well
overall
this
beer
drinks
easily
and
is
very
crisp
and
tasty
good
spring
and
summer
choice
disappointing
taste
like
an
american
adjunctlight
lager
with
no
snappiness
or
crispness
maybe
my
bottle
was
bad
absolutely
nothing
special
d
definitely
made
for
mass
consumption
have
at
the
sixer
over
a
spring
texas
fling
d
this
has
it
where
it
counts
and
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
shiner
brews
exhibiting
both
a
good
grasp
of
the
style
as
well
as
lager
brewing
despite
being
labeled
an
ale
thanks
texas
maybe
youll
get
it
one
day
nice
drinkability
for
this
crisp
beer
its
just
the
thing
to
get
me
in
the
mood
for
spring
this
is
another
special
beer
from
shiner
that
doesnt
impress
its
not
bad
but
its
nothing
id
want
to
purposefully
drink
again
d
after
i
agitated
the
beer
when
i
was
half
a
glass
down
to
release
some
of
the
carbonation
the
beer
went
down
really
smooth
over
all
a
good
lager
if
the
carbonation
was
reduced
by
about
1
volume
d
very
tasty
and
i
really
like
the
5
5
abv
could
drink
these
all
night
drinkability
isnt
bad
as
well
better
with
less
carbo
i
deem
it
worthy
to
pick
up
from
time
to
time
d
very
nice
quaffer
here
has
that
perfect
balance
between
a
helles
and
pils
in
malt
and
hop
character
another
very
nice
rendition
from
shiner
now
can
we
talk
about
that
bock
thanks
dave
not
an
exciting
beer
but
thats
partly
because
the
style
is
pretty
unexciting
this
example
does
hit
the
dortmunderexport
style
square
on
d
this
was
an
okay
beer
there
are
better
dortmunders
out
there
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
one
finger
a
bright
white
foam
aromas
are
disappointingly
subdued
mostly
grainy
with
a
bit
of
honeylike
sweetness
flavors
are
good
but
uninteresting
which
is
hardly
a
knock
because
the
same
could
be
said
of
almost
every
other
dortmunder
ive
tried
with
an
extremely
low
hoppiness
the
flavors
are
dominated
by
unremarkable
malts
not
bad
but
joins
the
other
members
of
its
style
in
lacking
character
a
bubbly
and
effervescent
beer
with
a
clear
orangish
gold
hue
a
moderate
pour
produced
two
fingers
of
head
which
quickly
subsided
smells
of
biscuity
malt
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
adjuncts
i
think
i
smell
corn
fairly
unimpressive
taste
malt
was
lack
luster
and
thin
hops
made
no
appearance
and
adjuncts
definitely
come
through
on
the
bright
side
served
cold
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
absolutely
a
step
above
bmc
but
imo
not
much
more
than
average
american
lager
mouthfeel
is
heavy
which
is
unusual
considering
this
is
a
light
beer
and
there
is
an
odd
metallic
finish
i
also
expected
more
carbonation
on
the
whole
pretty
average
if
it
was
a
dollar
cheap
for
a
sixer
id
say
go
for
it
but
at
7
75
youre
not
missing
anything
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
and
had
a
lively
carbonation
easy
to
drink
overall
too
weak
for
my
palet
but
not
a
bad
brew
seemed
a
bit
watery
if
you
ask
me
im
curious
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
just
shiner
fröst
relabeled
this
dortmunder
is
grassy
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
carbonation
i
wish
i
had
some
shiner
fröst
here
to
compare
it
to
but
i
dont
im
at
my
favoritve
bar
and
they
are
corrently
out
of
it
if
this
is
indeed
the
same
beer
as
shiner
fröst
i
must
say
i
dont
like
it
as
much
shiner
spring
ale
dortmunder
seems
to
have
some
adjuncty
flavor
that
comes
through
especially
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
it
also
seems
sweeter
than
i
remember
shiner
fröst
being
but
perhaps
my
palate
has
changed
or
this
particular
pint
is
not
up
to
snuff
the
adjunctiness
is
the
most
disturbing
part
for
me
as
it
adds
a
dirtiness
to
the
flavor
of
this
beer
that
i
do
not
appreciate
that
being
said
everyone
is
different
and
if
your
a
shiner
man
you
sholuld
try
it

the

not
a

beer
at
alli
could
see
drinking
this
grilling
this
spring
without
any
problem
at
all
this
is
alright
for
drinkability
id
say
i
could
have
this
again
i
cant
say
i
am
desiring
it
or
very
fond
but
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
i
cant
unfortunately
compare
it
to
others
in
this
style
as
either
better
or
worse
since
this
is
my
first
one
so
i
am
trying
not
to
be
too
middle
of
the
road
here
but
id
drink
another
for
sure
no
problem
the
beer
pours
a
solid
gold
color
with
very
active
carbonation
and
very
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
not
quite
as
impressive
as
i
get
some
light
honey
a
hint
of
underlying
oranger
citrus
bitterness
and
not
much
else
the
flavor
profile
replicates
the
nose
in
this
lightly
sweet
lager
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
long
almost
slick
finish
considering
the
fairly
low
alcohol
this
beer
delivers
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
drinkabilty
is
pretty
good
in
this
fairly
low
alcohol
beer
though
i
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
to
it
still
this
is
an
easy
to
enjoy
easy
to
appreciate
lager
from
the
folks
at
shiner
taste
a
tad
bit
of
lemon
with
some
grassy
notes
i
think
sthis
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
shiner
i
look
forward
to
more
of
their
offerings
drinkability
you
can
knock
back
a
few
of
these
without
any
problems
but
the
fact
remains
you
have
to
desire
to
knock
them
back
and
really
im
lacking
that
desire
at
the
moment
id
definitely
be
more
interested
in
it
during
the
summer
months
though
not
bad
but
not
great
pretty
onenote
but
maybe
thats
all
you
want
in
a
light
spring
seasonal
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
though
and
i
cant
really
imagine
buying
any
more
decent
but
forgettable
drinkability
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
to
opinion
well
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
has
a
pretty
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
which
is
essential
for
this
style
and
i
would
actually
say
that
it
is
pretty
close
to
what
the
guys
over
the
water
are
doing
it
could
use
a
different
balance
to
the
water
as
this
is
currently
too
clean
either
way
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
this
glass
to
the
end
id
give
it
a
try
if
i
were
you
and
it
was
convenient
but
i
wouldnt
drive
100
miles
into
texas
for
it
or
anything
poured
a
bomber
in
anticipation
of
last
years
funness
but
nyet
weird
and
i
mean
weird
aroma
and
taste
that
i
gotta
think
was
not
supposed
to
be
there
smelled
like
wet
cardboard
and
burning
plastic
basically
it
was
like
i
left
my
gi
joe
in
its
original
cardboard
70s
box
priceless
heirloom
out
in
the
rain
and
then
it
caught
on
fire
thats
what
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
d
drinkability
is
good
i
could
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
these
back
during
the
warmer
springsummer
months
a
very
sessionable
brew
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
and
it
was
ok
to
say
the
least
i
was
not
too
impressed
and
i
would
not
buy
again
poured
a
clear
orangeyellow
little
hop
presence
more
malt
dont
prefer
this
over
the
regular
shiner
carbonation
is
average
and
the
taste
is
not
anything
to
die
for
the
brilliant
bright
white
head
on
this
beer
is
stunning
this
was
my
first
time
to
try
this
beer
and
i
am
pretty
sure
i
like
it
better
than
shiner
bock
pours
clear
copper
brown
in
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
has
decent
retention
there
is
a
little
lacing
as
well
smell
is
mostly
of
bread
and
grain
malts
maybe
a
little
toffee
although
there
is
a
nice
clean
lemon
hops
presents
in
the
background
not
too
complex
on
the
nose
taste
is
malty
and
biscuity
with
a
nice
lemon
bite
to
it
pretty
much
like
the
nose
although
the
bread
characters
are
more
pronounced
finishes
clean
with
just
a
little
lemony
aftertaste
very
good
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
with
good
bubbly
carbonation
very
refreshing
a
crisp
mouth
feel
although
very
simple
it
is
very
good
seeing
is
that
this
is
in
season
and
very
well
priced
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
beer
fourthbeer
potential
above
average
a
solid
effort
by
spoetzl
a
few
of
these
would
be
quite
refreshing
after
a
round
of
golf
d
i
really
cant
compare
this
to
beers
of
the
dortmunder
style
as
my
only
other
sampling
is
dog
days
and
that
was
probably
three
years
ago
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
an
average
spring
release
from
the
boys
at
spoetzl
meaning
this
is
something
you
can
grab
a
case
of
throw
it
on
the
boat
and
enjoy
the
day
out
on
the
water
too
bad
it
isnt
in
cans
that
way
i
could
take
it
with
me
toobin
on
the
guadalupe
d
the
lower
abv
on
this
beer
makes
it
a
good
multidrinker
the
flavors
are
a
little
off
but
it
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
nothing
too
terrible
and
i
would
love
to
have
another
one
if
given
the
chance
drinks
really
easy
not
a
world
beater
here
but
one
would
happily
sip
on
while
watching
sports
on
tv
or
having
pizza
theres
a
few
from
shiner
i
cant
stand
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
drinkability
is
very
good
this
might
be
best
shiner
beer
i
have
had
to
date
very
lively
beer
pours
a
rich
honey
color
with
a
very
bubbly
loose
head
good
looking
beer
sweet
honey
malts
and
piney
hops
in
the
nose
light
pear
wisps
and
some
spice
too
pale
malts
with
more
piney
hops
varieties
a
little
harsh
on
the
palette
spicy
bubbles
and
a
good
hops
bitterness
gives
it
a
slightly
raw
character
definite
honey
tastes
not
bad
poured
into
a
nonic
english
pub
pint
glass
a
nice
golden
color
white
head
that
dissipates
to
minimal
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
and
a
whiff
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
taste
up
front
is
grain
followed
by
light
malt
sweetness
finishing
with
light
floral
hops
carbonation
is
perfect
flows
down
the
throat
with
great
ease
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinkability
easy
to
drink
refreshing
never
loses
its
appeal
i
could
do
with
drinking
this
no
problem
overall
its
a
refreshing
wellstyled
daydrinking
kind
of
beersomething
id
personally
want
for
breakfast
even
since
its
light
enough
for
foggyeyes
but
hearty
enough
to
coat
the
empty
stomach
a
bit
it
doesnt
quite
match
up
to
jinx
proofa
beer
thats
one
of
my
favorites
within
the
lighter
lager
universe
and
thats
likewise
very
underrated
to
my
mindbut
its
probably
more
true
to
dortmundstyle
form
so
points
for
that
are
in
order
overall
as
a
dortmunder
export
lager
this
one
works
try
it
if
you
see
but
remember
its
a
dortmunder
so
keep
it
real
folks
great
representation
of
the
style
this
is
my
first
foray
into
dortmunder
lagers
so
far
i
like
it
a
lot
12
oz

poured
into

with

of
particularly
small
densely
packed
bubbles

crackerlike
doughy

with
a
slight
sweetness
yet
largely
crisp
and
dry
with
an
emergent
nip

a
hint

nice

heavier
than
a
pilsener
with
some
carbonation
bite
and
a
multipart
finish
goes
biscuit
malt
but
swiftly
transitions
to
bitter
grassy
hops
although
no
hardcore
dortmunder
expert
this
closely
jives
with
classic
descriptions
of
the
style
softer
than
a
pils
a
little
sweeter
a
little
hoppier
maybe
this
overshoots
the
mark
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
a
not
imported
after
all
hahaha
clear
flinty
bite
wonderful

type

mouthfeel
is
light

pretty
good
i
was
surprised
with
this
dortmund
great
balance
perceivable
hops
and
a
very
subtle
fruitiness
you
see
on
kolsch
i
would
sure
have
this
again
a
pretty
robust
and
enjoyable
version
of
the
oldworld
style
malty
hoppy
and
worthy
of
the
industrial
might
of
the
ruhr
valley
in
its
goings
between
could
easily
see
killing
a
number
of

hitting

can
do

very
well
balanced

with

at

malts

nice

carbonated

there
is
a
strange

bothers
me
ok
beer
overall

could
do
with
a
smoother

flavor
is
biscuit
malt
with
hints
of
bread
light
apple

and
lemon
citrus
finishes
with
dry
biscuit
with
grassy
hops
that
taste
authentic
for
a
german
style
beer
not
one
of
my
goto
styles
but
this
was
very
nicely
balanced
with
a
pleasant
malt
and
hop
component
nicely
done
and
great
with
dinner
o
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
i
wish
the
noble
hop
characteristics
were
amped
up
a
small
bit
and
it
has
a
distinct
but
subdued
toasted
quality
in
the
mid
palate
no
complaints
otherwise
pretty
decent
brew
o
it
looks
more
then
decent
12
finger
foam
staying
till
bottom
taste
is
not
so
powerful
but
it
is
full
of
grain
tastes
who
like
this
stile
will
be
satisfy
overall
just
meh
it
is
good
to
drink
this
rather
than
cheap
adjuncts
in
northeast
china
its
labeled
as
4
7
abv
but
in
fact
this
one
i
just
drank
is
5
4
abv
dont
know
cheers
to
the
summer
overall
the
flavors
seem
ordinary
and
onedimensional
the
bitterness
is
not
one
that
refreshes
it
begins
to
annoy
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
there
is
no
offensive
about
this
beer
but
a
bit
lackluster
fairness
yesrepetition
no
overall
pretty
average
beer
nothing
remarkable
about
it
except
its
very
low
price
o
an
easy
drink
that
does
not
feel
as
fake
as
other
industrial
beers
half
a
point
bonus
for
being
so
cheap
dr
relatively
low
abv
with
a
crap
taste
and
an
excellent
price
40
euro
in
berlin
this
is
what
we
might
politely
call
a
student
beer
in
terms
of
regional
considerations
its
better
than
the
crap
cola
porter
mixes
often
seen
on
shelves
alongside
it
in
germany
but
that
isnt
saying
a
great
deal
if
the
cream
were
amped
up
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
d
i
quite
liked
this
beer
as
ill
take
dominant
sweetness
over
bitterness
any
day
its
nothing
intriguing
but
the
affordability
makes
it
a
good
everyday
beer
with
a
place
in
my
fridge
bottle
poured
a
deep
bright
yellow
color
helles
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
is
a
bit
overwhelming
with
not
much
else
i
term
of
noticeable
characteristics
taste
is
also
too
sweet
for
the
style
with
no
hops
presence
discernable
body
is
quite
full
with

carbonation
this
one
is
too
sweet
for
my
own

poured

a
nice
foamy
frothy
white
head
and
a
tiny

a

of

a
little

flavor
is
like
nose
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweetness
coming
out
especially
in
the
finish
other
than
that
flavor
is
quite
bland
body
is
ok
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
like
i
said
and
strangely
has
a
little

forgettable
beer
better
than
a
light

generally
speaking
ceptin

d
a

not

its

its
in

not

to
complain
about
drink
oettinger
cold
and
from
the
bottle
for

enjoyment
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
with
actual
flavor
though
the
flavor
is
at
times
not
very
good
the
beer
was
easy
drinking
but
im
not

i
want
to
drink
it
again
a
good
and
enjoyable
beer
from

notes

a
cheap
beer
that
doesnt
taste
horrible
but
there
are
certainly
better
beers
and
examples
than
this
one
not
very
balanced
but
makes
a
decent
summer
time
beer
to
drink
i
find
as
i
continue
to
read
others
reviews
of
german
beer
many
recieve
low
scores
because
of
an
overall
lack
of
a
wow
factor
now
that
im
cut
off
from
the
world
of
barrelaged
12
stouts
and
ipas
with
8
hop
varietials
i
actually
am
finding
more
and
more
in
the
simple
refined
execution
o
these
traditional
brews
a
good
thing
in
really
being
able
to
find
the
hidden
subtile
flavors
often
overlooked
but
i
really
am
looking
foward
to
the
palateblowing
intensity
of
craft
beer
cheers
gold
color
and
small
head
that
disappeared
quickly
not
too
impressed
initial
taste
was
carbonation
malt
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
that
was
not
hoppy
it
was
more
like
a
metalic
taste
that
persisted
throughout
the
entire
experience
this
is
quite
different
from
the
oettinger
gold
in
the
big
bottle
cheap
price
and
cheap
tasting
i
wish
this
was
a
good
beer
due
to
the
price
i
just
cant
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
i
have
tried
this
several
times
to
be
sure
that
it
was
not
a
bad
batch
and
the
taste
is
the
same
i
passed
by
the
brewery
recently
and
hoped
to
try
some
of
the
other
brands
however
there
is
too
much
good
beer
brewed
close
by
to
take
a
chance
on
an
inferior
product
oh
yeah
the
bottle
says
5
4
abv
not
4
7
but
i
know
this
is
the
same
label
same
beer
as
the
title
says
is
the
4
7
a
typo
or
did
they
up
the
recently
smells
malty
with
a
bitter
flat
hoppy
smell
pours
to
a
standard
yellowish
lager
color
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
marzenlike
the
hoppy
bitterness
evident
in
the
smell
is
almost
not
present
in
the
taste
quite
a
common
tasting
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
this
tastes
light
and
makes
good
for
a
good
session
beer
not
too
bad
after
all
clean
drinkable
d
acceptable
and
not
unpleasant
to
drink
found
this
refreshing
enough
nothing
outstanding
in
the
flavour
or
smell
but
could
drink
a
few
and
at
40p
i
did
overall
an
acceptable
beer
for
bbqs
but
not
much
else
i
was
dissapointed
because
from
the
pour
and
smell
it
looked
like
it
might
be
good
too
bad
once
again
using
the
25
cl
glass
received
inch
head
just
a
few
seconds
and
it
disappears
into
a
nice
rim
fizz
the
color
is
that
of
a
yellow
gummi
bear
smell
is
a
light
caramel
and
malt
with
the
taste
being
the
same
note
to
self
rated
24
dortmunder
export
lager
when
i
reviewed
it
overall
a
decent
lager
with
a
very
easy
drinking
taste
and
feel
nothing
outstanding
but
rather
crisp
and
refreshing
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
grassy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
nothing
i
would
go
after
again
a
bit
too
sweet
reminds
of
euro
pale
lager
overall
alright
for
sampling
it
isnt
something
i
would
just
order
o
overall
a
pretty
average
lager
lots
of
that
grain
and
corn
in
the
nose
and
taste
not
bad
at
all
but
pretty
average
would
suggest
trying
one
of
their
other
beers
initial
mpression
is
a
cross
between
unmalted
and
malted
pale
grains
relatively
thin
but
the
aftertaste
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
brings
some
good
balance
overall
id
say
this
is
a
true
to
style
dortmunder
the
taste
provides
a
nice
recovery
from
the
poor
handling
of
the
glassware
had
the
golden
export
at
the
g
b
in
bolingbrook
il
last
evening
the
color
was
a
clear
yellow
with
white
head
that
laced
slightly
the
aroma
was
common
of
dortmunder
grain
saaz
hops
etc
the
first
taste
was
overpowering
with
grain
and
was
a
bit
rough
but
the
following
drinks
were
more
smooth
the
grain
and
malt
was
balanced
with
hops
and
the
beer
came
off
the
pallet
clean
overall
not
to
bad
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
good
session
beer
poured

taste
nothing
too
interesting
happening
lightly
toasted
grains
and
light
citrus
and
piney
hops
leaving
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
balanced
but
just
too
light
for
me

youre
playing
it

thin
for
my
pallet
restaurant
setting
w
a
nice
outdoor
seating
area
food
caters
to
the
masses
as
does
the
beer
not
a
bad
beer
overall
which
is
surprising
considering
their
other
beers
i
would
order
this
again
especially
at
gb
considering
their
other
options
good
beer
for
the
summer
d
american
macro
lagers
wish
they
could
taste
like
this
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
small
amount
of
white
head
not
a
lot
going
with
the
smell
but
do
get
a
bit
of
malt
and
hops
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
nothing
much
but
very
clean
medium
carbonation
and
really
easy
to
drink
had
this
as
well
as
a
couple
other
beers
at
gordon
biersch
not
great
but
not
bad
either

well
in

a

id
like
to
see
more
of
and
this
one
is
pretty
well
done
the
beer
felt
light
and
maybe
a
bit
over
carbonated
but
overall
felt
right
the
beers
best
quality
was
the
drinkability
i
could
have
easily
could
have
downed
a
couple
without
thinking
about
it
overall
a
decent
beer
but
certainly
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
or
make
a
special
trip
to
try
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
golden
export
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
just
bland
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
uninspired
good
for
what
it
is
a
light
lager
though
nothing
that
resembles
a
dortmunderexport
lager
ge
pours
a
very
clear
lemonlike
gold
color
with
a
white
head
i
could
smell
a
bit
of
pils
malt
sweetness
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
balanced
between
equal
parts
pils
malt
and
hop
bitterness
the
pils
malt
is
just
a
little
sweet
yet
balanced
by
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
that
is
very
smooth
and
sticks
around
on
the
palate
for
a
bit
overall
it
is
medium
bodied
medium
carbonated
and
smooth

goes

beer
at

even
by
admission
of
the
waiter
who
said
it
was
popular
and
added
it
compares
to
your
typical
macro
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
that
bad

its
definitely
the
beer
of
choice
for
the
microuninitiated

a

definitely
a

beginning

beer
but
there
is
a
sharp
hop
bite
and
it
does
go
down
smooth
i
guess
this
is
there
version
of
a
light
beer
and
it
is
better
than
a
bud
or
miller
that
being
said
i
think
this
is
the
beer
a
nonbeer
drinker
gets
and
if
you
like
real
beer
you
can
skip
this
trust
me
overall
somewhat
refreshing
not
one
i
would
search
out
just
too
light
and
lacking
any
character
the
export
lager
poured
very
clear
a
light
golden
color
with
persistant
carbonation
its
initial
head
dispersed
to
a
ring
leaving
sudsy
retention
on
the
glass
golden
malts
light
hops
and
as
it
warmed
an
aroma
of
wildflower
honey
nice
tasted
of
floral
hops
clean
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
bitter
yeast
fairly
crisp
finish
damned
fine
for
the
style
which
admittedly
is
not
my
favorite
presented
as
a
medium
golden
color
beer
with
white
puffy
head
smell
is
light
with
slight
malt
notes
present
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
and
unobtrusive
finishes
with
a
slight
sweetness
but
not
much
else
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
great
a
step
up
from
a
macro
sampled
at
the

the

is
quite

and
this
would
be
a

choice
for
a

day
this
is
one
of
gordon
bierschs
better
beers
a
pleasant
mediumbodied
brew
that
goes
down
easy
beer
after
beer
ive
had
it
at
the
gb
brewery
restaurant
and
in
bottles
its
often
on
sale
at
trader
joes
ca
for
4
99sixpack
which
is
a
bargain
for
an
aboveaverage
beer
gb
golden
export
isnt
a
great
beer
but
its
a
good
one
not
at
all
bitter
perhaps
even
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
not
my
favorite
but
a
contender
at
the
right
price
not
a
bad
beer
ive
had
several
and
like
them
but
gb
has
better
as
i
take
my
first
smell
it
flashes
me
back
to
my
days
of
downing
milwaukees
best
light
after
losing
at
beerpong
i
cant
describe
the
smell
very
well
other
than
it
smelling
like
a
cheap
american
lager
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
nothing
special
starts
like
carbonated
water
and
ends
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
remind
you
that
you
are
drinking
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
carbonated
water
as
for
drinkability
i
could
drink
it
but
why
would
i
want
to
drinkability

this
went
down
quite
well
this
lager
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
minimal
malt
and
some
hops
the
taste
was
a
bit
thin
light
malt
and
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
bit
thin
this
was
an
ok
beer
easy
to
drink
but
rather
light
the
beer
pours
a
typical
lagerpils
golden
yellow
monstrous
bright
white
head
frothy
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
thin
sheet
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
the
archetypal
sweet
malt
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
excessively
sweet
fair
malt
presence
top
thin
as
my
patience
after
sitting
in
the
airport
for
almost
8
hours
finish
brisk
in
its
carbonation
and
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
quite
dry
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
to
long
overall
this
was
the
best
of
the
three
g
b
brews
i
tried
the
others
being
the
marzen
and
blonde
bock
golden
export
had
an
easy
drinkability
thanks
to
the
light
crisp
feel
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
sit
down
with
after
a
couple
hours
of
yardwork
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
didnt
want
to
believe
the
plethora
of
negative
comments
about
gb
i
will
not
purchase
another
gb
product
ive
renamed
this
beer
golden
shower
though
i
wouldnt
run
back
to
columbus
for
this
beer
if
i
got
my
hands
on
a
bottle
i
would
be
pleased
a
nice
little
lager
quite
a
drinkable
dortmunder
though
i
dunno
the
taste
grows
on
you
light

this
beer
is
very
light
in
color
aroma
and
even
taste
its
a
blanched
straw
color
with
the
slightest
amount
of
head
theres
very
little
detectable
aroma
other
than
the
slight
hint
of
malt
youd
expect
from
a
light
lager
the
taste
is
somewhat
surprising
though
its
a
very
delicate
but
interesting
beer
in
this
regard
for
such
a
clean
taste
it
really
has
many
subtle
flavors
that
really
compliment
each
other
and
make
the
beer
quite
enjoyable
it
would
be
an
excellent
yard
work
beer
quite
a
surprise
this
beer
is
a
bright
golden
yellow
clear
with
a
moderate
head
and
very
little
lacing
effect
the
aroma
is
fairly
light
with
a
nice
malt
sense
this
is
also
a
very
crisp
beer
with
plenty
of
bready
grain
sense
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
one
tha
will
set
the
world
on
fire
a
bit
light
in
body
sense
beer
was
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
good
session
type
of
beer
overall
good
food
unfortunately
picked
the
wrong
night
to
go
as
the
place
was
packed
to
the
rafters
so
this
is
a
dortmunder
nice
hops
and
gold
not
yellow
color
medium
head
and
minimal
lacing
while
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
by
no
means
gbs
best
beer
if
you
are
getting
a
gb
go
for
the
marzen
or
dunkles
as
usual
a
very
goodlooking
beer
taste
is
simply
malt
and
a
slight
sourness
that
seems
common
in
gordon
biersch
beers
not
impressive
but
not
bad
this
beer
goes
really
well
with
the
pot
stickers
actually
tastes
better
with
them
than
without
overall
decent
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
even
for
a
dortmunder
an
average
example
of
a
dortmunder
fresh
and
elegant
with
a
good
balance
of
honeysuckle
pear
and
citrus
aromatics
nuanced
with
some
cajun
notes
delicate
yet
with
a
surprisingly
long
finish

but
the

is

more
desirable
than

and
thats
what
we
get
here
aktien
doesnt
date
so
i
was
wary
picking
this
up
but
dortmunder
is
a
rare
style
so
i
took
the
risk
good
beer
at
under
3500
ml
a
fine
pick
up
this
is
perfectly
good
but
not
outstanding
in
any
way
not
something
id
buy
often
light
in
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
this
beer
is
solid
but
for
the
distressing
lack
of
bitterness
for
which
i
shall
have
to
penalize
it
the
body
though
is
great
while
light
it
manages
to
delicately
coat
the
palate
quite
drinkable
id
love
to
try
it
fresher
this
really
strikes
me
as
a
stale
example
of
a
helles
than
it
does
of
a
pils
hazed
bronze
with
a
decent
looking
bone
colored
head
that
leaves
some
gritty
looking
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
bready
and
sweet
with
honey
and
mild
hops
saaz
hops
and
fresh
doughy
yeast
with
soft
lemon
and
honey
medium
bodied
with
a
fine
mild
cabonation
a
tasty
and
heavy
duty
pils
for
sure
yellow
golden
lager
with
a
pure
white
head
strangely
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
boiled
beetroot
which
for
me
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
for
a
beer
after
i
get
past
my
past
the
scent
is
more
malty
doughy
the
flavour
is
not
beetroot
but
a
fairly
robust
malt
accented
lager
almost
a
helles
really
honeyish
and
buscuity
with
a
thick
palate
it
was
an
ok
beer
and
would
have
got
an
extra
point
or
two
had
it
not
been
for
a
slightly
cloying
finish
3

the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
but
not
overpowering
the
hops
are
floral
and
slightly
herbal
the
appearance
is
unique
for
a
lager
in
that
its
unfiltered
and
i
like
it
the
color
is
golden
with
a
two
finger
head
the
flavor
is
rich
with
butter
and
malt
and
lightly
bitter
and
herbal
it
gives
you
the
impression
of
herbal
sour
dough
bread
the
palate
is
a
little
thin
but
its
what
you
would
expect
from
a
lager
the
flavor
is
consistent
from
start
to
finish
with
the
aftertaste
lingering
a
little
by
far
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
pours
a
clouded
straw
gold
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
light
floral
and
with
a
touch
of
lemon
rind
flavor
is
light
and
refreshing
slight
wheaty
edge
with
a
touch
of
light
sweetness
and
a
slightly
present
lemon
citrus
edge
feel
is
good
light
on
the
mouth
and
a
typical
carbonation
putting
tiny
bubbles
all
over
your
tongue
definitely
drinkable
so
light
and
refreshing
itd
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
as
opposed
to
a
blithering
cold
one
which
i
am
tasting
it
on
worth
a
try
german
halfliter
bottle
with
02
06
on
the
back
label
it
pours
crystalclear
gold
with
light
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
white
head
that
deposits
decent
lace
lemony
and
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
backing
of
sweet
malts
adjuncts
and
veggies
there
is
a
faint
graininess
on
the
palate
with
sweet
malts
veggies
and
flashes
of
green
almost
citric
noble
hops
the
body
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
fleeting
finish
almost
comparable
to
pbr
really
their
4
9
pils
jubiläums
is
much
better
wonderful
summer
beer
this
is
a
quality
brew
and
im
quite
surprised
i
was
able
to
find
it
at
my
local
international
food
store
notes
kind
of
boring
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
love
german
pilseners
and
its
arguably
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
is
really
malted
and
unbalanced
taste
is
more
of
the
same
malt
honey
hops
with
a
slight
alcohol
bloom
medium
bodied
with
a
light
effervescence
a
decent
beer
but
nothig
special
for
me
flavor
is
a
nice
malt
with
a
slightly
stronger
than
it
should
be
hops
profile
in
the
first
sip
but
as
the
half
liter
moves
along
balance
becomes
a
bit
more
even
the
hops
are
a
bit
piney
and
weedy
for
my
tastes
kind
of
stale
in
feel
it
tastes
fine
but
just
does
not
grab
me
lots
of
other
german
golden
beers
pilsener
and
otherwise
that
are
better
not
bad
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
a
lot
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
and
crisp
pale
malt
scent
that
is
a
bit
musty
and
dry
due
to
the
lager
yeast
it
slightly
bitter
bearing
german
style
hops
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
light
and
slightly
sweet
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
bitter
and
musty
its
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
as
well
as
a
slight
bisquity
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
german
pilsner
it
is
an
easy
drinker
i
prefer
a
czech
pilsner
though
overall
similar
to
other
beers
that
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
which
i
find
is
light
in
character
yet
extremely
drinkable
this
is
no
moldbreaking
beer

but
it
is
worth
a
try
i
really
like
german
lagers
i
think
only
germans
can
do
real
good
lagers
i
dont
know
how
they
do
it
but
they
do
it
and
this
beer
is
a
good
thing
of
german
beer
i
can
call
it
a
classic
of
german
brewing
this
beer
has
an
amber
color
good
foam
and
really
rich
malt
aroma
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
malt
only
malt
with
no
hops
on
finish
its
not
too
sweet
its
medium
malty
taste
the
people
who
love
lagers
i
can
recommend
this
pale
german
lager
its
really
tasty

what
i
like
about
this

is
you

beers
it
doesnt
dry
your

out
drinkability
is
another
high
point

and
carbonated
well
a
midrange

also
serves
to
boost
this
factor
not
sure
if
this
is
a
pilsner
but
makes
a
damn
fine
helles
really
fantastic
in
quality
freshness
and
overall
enjoyability
this
is
a
well
balanced
helles
and
went
down
very
well
in
all
i
taste
a
mixture
of
mild
hops
and
barley
and
nothing
much
else
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
slightly
reminiscent
of
their
other
beers
maybe
the
yeast
they
use
of
course

an

a

id
say
its
somewhere

and
body
with
a
smooth
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
without
feeling
too
thin
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
dortmunder
style
very
clean
with
good
balance
of
flavors
and
minimal
esters
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
without
going
over
the
top
with
an
in
depth
analysis
this
is
a
good
cheap
lite
tasting
beer
that
works
well
with
fast
foods
overall
there
is
nothing
too
complex
about
it
this
is
troublefree
light
lager
made
of
barley
malt
and
hops
not
a
common
beer
to
be
found
in
my
location
but
still
miles
better
than
most
in
its
price
range
and
yet
still
very
drinkable
the
taste
is
ok
not
real
clean
though
like
its
been
in
this
bottle
too
long
i
am
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
again
but
maybe
it
just
isnt
very
exciting
othis
is
an
example
of
a
great
german
lager
i
truly
could
drink
large
amounts
of
this
in
a
sitting
it
goes
down
so
easily
with
a
fresh
taste
of
beer
this
beer
is
light
bodied
with
heavy
carbonation
at
times
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
pop
rather
than
beer
there
is
a
slight
dry
finish
grab
it
if
you
can
find
it
for
less
than
7
otherwise
avoid
if
you
have
to
pay
full
price
overall
not
that
good
at
all
never
seen
this
beer
before
and
i
bought
it
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
more
of
a
wit
beer
then
i
poured
it
oh
well
if
you
see
it
pass
it
up
feels
light
and
goes
down
easy
for
the
price
this
isnt
a
bad
pick
brewed
and
bottled
by
dortmunder
hansabrauerei
gmbh
4415
dortmund
germany
not
all
that
great
specimen
of
this
beer
o
not
for
me
pass
as
noted
earlier
by
a
ba
member
maybe
just
maybe
if
it
was
served
super
ice
cold
on
a
hot
sweaty
day
would
i
welcome
this
again
overall
this
was
an
average
example
export
lager
it
was
pretty
light
and
smooth
which
made
for
good
drinkability
the
flavors
werent
too
impressive
but
they
remained
true
to
the
style
i
thought
i
was
buying
a
traditional
german
export
lager
and
it
was
pretty
close
to
that
it
was
just
brewed
in
namibia
instead
of
germany
i
wouldnt
search
this
beer
out
but
it
might
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
drinkability
is
it
best
attribute
very
easy
drinking
session
beer
very
refreshing
but
not
something
that
wows
you
i
definately
could
put
down
alot
of
these
fast
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
if
i
wanted
something
light
and
not
too
strong
but
i
definately
wouldnt
go
searching
for
this
i
like
dortmunders
they
have
a
unique
taste
this
baby
comes
in
a
16oz
bottle
and
is
on
sale
at
my
store
for
6
49
cant
beat
it
pours
a
bubbly
yellow
color
with
a
fine
head
smell
musty
with
a
little
hop
spiceyness
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
true
to
the
german
purity
law
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
and
chill
with
but
dont
expect
heaps
of
flavor
well
just
got
another
2
cases
for
25
in
nj
they
got
rid
of
the
canned
hops
though
now
using
hop
extract
also
now
using
a
super
aga
that
makes
capping
these
bottles

ill
admit
ive
never
had
a
dortmunder
style
brew
before
a
very
good
beer
and
definitely
up
there
with
the
best
lagerstyle
beers
i
think
i
have
tried
slightly
sweet
with
a
great
balance
between
flavours
and
one
that
proved
very
easy
to
drink
from
the
start
o
good
drinkability
another
smooth
and
easidrinking
german
lager
beer
now
the
smell
and
taste
smell
is
ok
but
not
breathtaking
it
is
as
to
be
expected
in
this
style
taste
is
rather
flat
because
of
the
lack
of
carbonation
some
sweetness
with
a
bit
dry
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
very
one
dimensional
even
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
grassy
hops
and
grain
the
flavor
is
grassy
hops
with
low
bitterness
and
some
grain
and
bready
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
too
much
going
on
here
the
5
6abv
is
just
about
detectable
within
the
brew
but
i
found
the
whole
expereince
a
bit
disappointing
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
i
traded
this
at
the
prezythos
earlier
in
the
year
and
had
been
saving
it
for
a
treat
big
mistake
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
dominant
as
i
drink
the
beer
and
lowers
drinkability
a
touch
or
two
this
is
a
decent
brew
pretty
hard
to
find
unless
you
are
in
munich
but
ill
stick
with
the
augustiner
or
andechs
cheers
this
brew
reminds
me
of
augustiners
export
offering
edelstoff
and
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
a
typical
export
its
all
around
a
good
set
of
suds
edit
on
my
trip
from
611
this
was
much
bolder
and
it
had
a
creamy
nearly
czech
like
flavor
i
found
it
to
be
much
better
this
time
and
i
had
it
at
the
same
exact
locale
taste
is
full
as
the
aroma
promises
and
theres
not
a
whole
lot
there
besides
the
malts
a
little
bit
of
hops
towards
the
finish
aftertaste
is
okay
a
bit
metallic
nevertheless
a
good
beer
and
i
respect
the
stronger
alcohol
content
as
in
i
like
is
as
much
as
i
am
wary
of
it
numbing
carbonation
all
right
overall
as
others
have
mentioned
its
nothing
spezial
not
a
grand
beer
to
say
the
least
but
enjoyable
still
average
to
light
body
hop
in
the
aftertaste
points
of
metallic
i
brought
this
bottle
back
with
me
from
bavaria
tegernsee
is
a
beautiful
brewery
on
a
crystal
clear
lake
i
dont
know
how
long
they
have
been
brewing
but
its
a
long
damn
time
like
most
bavarian
lagers
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
i
guess
that
comes
from
brewing
for
several
hunderd
years
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
great
big
white
head
wonderful
aroma
very
refreshing
smooth
taste
i
wish
someone
in
the
us
could
brew
a
lager
this
good
fantstic
mouthfeel
and
super
high
drinkability
make
this
a
great
drinking
beer
taste
is
light
malty
with
some
hoppiness
and
some
bitterness
these
tastes
are
numb
and
not
very
outspoken
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
warm
and
the
beer
tastes
like
a
heavy
pilsner
this
is
not
very
special
i
had
a
liter
of
this
on
tap
of
course
at
the
hirschgarten
beer
garden
in
western
munich
the
beer
was
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
massive
head
the
way
all
light
colored
beers
appear
in
these
huge
1l
mugs
it
had
a
neutral
and
malty
aroma
and
flavor
honestly
a
little
hard
to
tell
a
difference
from
the
helles
beers
which
are
served
in
the
same
manner
all
over
the
city
kind
of
light
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
in
its
correct
setting
probably
not
something
id
reach
for
at
home

from

pretty
pleased
overall
overall
this
beer
seems
to
be
pretty
strongly
underrated
in
my
opinion
its
definitely
no
gaginducing
adjunct
lager
that
said
its
a
somewhat
bland
but
serviceable
beer
its
not
really
crisp
enough
to
be
a
pilsner
nor
rich
enough
to
be
a
dortmunder
but
its
refreshing
enough
for
me

thanks
josh
for
doing
a
fairly
fresh
bottle
i
could
do
this
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
o
out
of
all
4
of
this
brewerys
products
this
one
is
probably
the
best
in
terms
of
flavor
fullness
aroma
and
most
definitely
looks
still
not
one
of
the
better
beers
out
there
it
serves
its
purpose
and
if
i
had
to
drink
this
one
again
i
wouldnt
complain
i
probably
woundnt
seek
this
one
out
again
though
unless
on
vacation
in
the
honduras
average
at
best
ive
definitely
had
worse
o
this
was
the
best
of
the
three
i
tried
because
it
had
something
unique
about
it
this
one
is
all
about
cold
moderately
alcoholic
refreshment
on
the
beach
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
if
youre
looking
for
a
better
beer
experience
in
honduras
try
a
pina
colada
cuz
you
probably
aint
gonna
find
it
carbonation
was
at
a
nice
level
therefore
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
country
like
honduras
the
beer
was
a
pale
straw
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
rising
and
a
thick
white
mattresslike
head
that
grew
into
a
snow
cone
shape
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
and
just
stayed
there
it
smells
of
grassy
lemon
hops
and
adjuncts
the
taste
is
mostly
bready
malt
with
some
lemon
and
hay
there
some
musty
flavors
and
its
pretty
macroish
it
feels
pretty
light
with
some
stinging
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
very
dry
this
beer
is
ok
at
best
d
amazingly
easy
to
drink
could
toss
them
back
all
day
id
call
this
a
completely
decent
beach
beer
there
was
a
fair
share
of
dms
and
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
corn
casserole
the
flavor
is
a
basic
but
fairly
clean
crisp
bready
malt
character
that
drops
the
mild
spiced
corn
aroma
yes
the
label
says
export
but
this
just
tastes
like
your
basic
pale
euro
lager
with
a
hint
of
fruit
that
most
american
lagers
lack
d
overall
this
really
isnt
a
bad
beer
sure
its
not
really
exciting
but
its
a
good
easy
to
drink
lager
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
hey
its
worth
a
shot
rjt
dortmunder
tastes
more
like
an
adjunct
lager
to
me
i
would
be
shocked
if
this
was
all
malted
barley
cereal
grains
are
very
sweet
and
not
balanced
at
all
by
even
a
mere
hint
of
hops
mouthfeel
approaches
cloying
just
too
sweet
does
not
taste
as
bad
as
it
smells
but
bad
enough
to
contemplate
drain
pourage
edited
after
drinking
again
the
old
drinkability
score
had
to
be
adjusted
now
that
its

green

is

and
in

with
the
above
characteristics
in
other
words
not
that
great
finish
is
like
flavor
and
can
serve
the
purpose
of
the
moment
but
in
the
longer
term
best
forgotten
except
to
remind
yourself
to
try
and
get
something
better
my
dad
a
german
brewmeister
came
up
with
this
beer
and
even
though
it
is
not
a
a
class
beer
it
is
smooth
and
a
bit
stronger
hopsy
malt
flavour
compared
to
other
honduran
and
central
american
beers
out
there
it
certainly
deserves
more
credit
than
given
in
the
reviews
finally
an
import
from
central
america
that
isnt
an
american
adjunct
lager
at
least
not
officially
this
thing
pours
like
a
lighter
version
of
the
storebrand
vegetable
oil
in
my
kitchen
come
on
honduras
dont
do
this
to
me
the
ol
bait
n
switch
dirty
pool
honduras
the
nose
better
eat
its
spinach
cause
its
pretty
damn
weak
right
now
only
some
vague
corn
syrup
and
rice
notes
waft
through
the
thick
haze
that
is
the
air
the
taste
comes
pretty
close
to
approximating
this
but
with
less
sweetness
than
would
normally
be
expected
the
rice
fights
its
way
through
from
the
back
of
the
bus
damn
bullies
once
again
i
would
recommend
this
brew
eat
its
spinach
or
anything
for
that
matter
as
the
body
is
so
very
thin
finishing
with
an
unsurprisingly
dry
effect
honestly
im
not
sure
how
they
get
away
with
calling
this
thing
a
munder
for
that
style
this
is
pisspoor
as
an
aal
though
its
par
for
the
coursethough
anybody
can
shoot

at
that
crappy

pours

with

aroma

the
flavor
is
more

with
corn

some

sweetness

adjunct
flavor

piss
you
off
two
fairly
big
compliments
for
beers
of
this
sort
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
yellowgreen
with
a
surprisingly
ample
fizzy
white
head
smells
of
typical
macro
lager
adjuncts
though
with
a
slightly
malty
kick
to
it
that
makes
it
a
bit
more
pleasant
on
the
nose
very
similar
tastelike
any
other
nasty
adjunct
lager
but
somewhat
more
substantial
light
body
as
bad
as
this
is
its
quantifiably
better
than
bmc
stuff
at
the
least
rather
bland
but
a
mainly
inoffensive
brew
that
i
could
drink
plenty
of
to
quench
a
thirst
especially
on
a
hot
day
noted
as
a
crisp
and
refreshing
premium
pilsner
on
can
i
dont
get
all
the
negative
reviews
yes
this
beer
is
brewed
in
honduras
yes
it
has
a
clean
crisp
taste
to
it
yes
it
is
a
pilsener
you
dont
expect
complexity
or
anything
extra
special
from
it
but
it
does
deliver
on
the
style
and
for
a
pilsener
style
lager
its
right
in
line
with
urquell
or
warsteiner
i
found
it
better
tasting
than
warsteiner
in
fact
do
a
blind
taste
test
of
a
couple
and
leave
preconceptions
behind
you
will
be
surprised
it
has
the
light
hoppy
smell
but
nothing
much
else
taste
is
a
little
hoppy
up
front
then
very
clean
and
and
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
a
little
malty
and
grainy
tasting
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
which
is
right
for
the
style
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
exactly
what
you
want
in
a
pils
a
good
beer
though
not
outstanding
on
a
side
note
i
learned
that
some
rich
guy
went
over
to
roatan
and
actually
built
a
brewery
he
planned
to
brew
beer
for
the
island
and
i
believe
tried
to
but
was
quickly
run
out
of
the
business
by
the
big
wigs
i
guess
they
went
to
all
the
businesses
on
the
island
and
paid
them
not
to
sell
his
beer
and
continue
to
sell
these
4
as
the
only
local
beers
on
the
island
he
tried
to
sell
the
brewery
but
was
unsuccessful
and
he
now
makes
soda
with
the
equipment
when
out
snorkeling
or
scuba
diving
youll
want
to
stock
your
boat
with
port
royal
for
the
return
trip
this
beer
blends
well
with
the
salty
brine
that
has
infiltrated
your
mouth
and
sinuses
the
salt
brings
forth
the
crisp
yet
nutty
characteristics
that
may
be
lost
on
an
unmarinated
tongue
the
rejuvenating
characteristics
of
a
cold
port
royal
feel
great
to
a
body
that
has
been
pickling
in
the
briny
deep
all
day
out
of
the
3
beers
available
in
the
bay
islands
this
one
was
by
far
the
worst
grainy
corn
taste
that
was
very
hard
to
choke
down
along
with
a
little
skunk
flavor
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
if
you
have
to
choose
go
with
salva
vida
for
a
beer
in
honduras
the
aroma
is
not
good
but
unique
for
me
since
its
the
first
beer
that
has
ever
smell
like
personal
lubricant
on
top
of
that
you
have
a
touch
of
grass
hops
but
mostly
corn
like
malt
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
nice
head
that
lasts
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
yeah
the
palate
is
thin
but
ok
for
the
style
overall
its
pretty
bad
and
pretty
strange
port
royal
export
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
grainy
there
isnt
a
lot
of
flavor
a
bit
grainy
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
not
much
to
it
not
very
good
youd
be
better
off
looking
elsewhere
id
pass
overall
when
a
beers
appearance
is
its
strongest
point
not
a
good
sign
but
its
more
drinkable
than
some
other
downsouth
brews
tastier
than
other
central
american
beers
and
my
favorite
so
far
it
held
up
better
against
the
other
honduras
beers
which
werent
bad
either
though
a
bit
bland
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
is
a
good
pilsener
and
the
tastiest
central
american
beer
ive
come
across
i
tried
4
beers
on
my
day
in
honduras
and
this
was
probably
the
best
one
it
actually
tasted
like
a
beer
and
not
a
corny
vegetable
soup
not
much
hops
not
much
aroma
but
a
decent
smooth
barleyish
taste
that
was
a
welsome
change
from
my
other
experiences
having
said
that
it
was
nothing
special
dont
take
a
trip
to
honduras
just
for
the
beer
this
was
sampled
in
a
hotel
restaurant
in
honduras
after
having
toured
the
copan
ruins
and
had
little
to
choose
from
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
found
quite
acceptable
for
the
middle
of
central
america
overall
a
below
average
beer
but
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
in
a
bottle
just
to
see
if
theres
much
difference
in
the
metallic
flavor
it
is
actually
very
malty
when
compared
to
other
beers
from
this
region
very
smooth
quite
possibly
what
coors
could
taste
like
if
better
ingredients
were
used
in
the
brewing
process
very
light
and
easy
drinking
second
bottle
i
take
back
the
good
things
that
i
said
before
obvious
quality
problems
if
i
hadnt
known
better
i
would
have
said
this
was
a
heineken
with
a
different
label
a
light
sweet
grassy
cereal
honey
and
green
tasting
lager
with
a
surprising
medium
sized
body
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
but
short
lived
bubbly
white
head
light
sweet
grain
with
a
hint
of
bread
and
melanoid
not
bad
for
a
pale
lager
contrary
to
conventional
beer
geek
opinion
pale
lagers
even
massproduced
ones
canbe
a
source
of
uncomplicated
scrumptious
provided
theyre
done
right
thats
the
caveat
33
export
isnt
so
poorly
made
that
it
couldnt
be
enjoyed
given
the
right
conditions
but
by
and
large
it
is
a
beer
id
only
buy
again
with
counterfeit
money
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
pours
dark
straw
orange
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
weak
grain
not
much
else
tastes
of
watery
grain
but
with
a
tad
of
fruitiness
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
and
light
bodied
overall
an
ok
beer
enjoy
overall
this
beer
is
uninspiring
to
me
but
its
also
not
terrible
its
hot
out
today
which
is
contextually
appropriate
but
even
that
doesnt
strongly
help
its
drinkability
o
decent
for
what
it
is
a
thirstquenching
lager
designed
to
cool
you
down
on
a
hot
day
or
pair
with
a
salty
spicy
bowl
of
vietnamese
phở
noodle
soup
overall
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
enough
to
have
it
again
even
a
clear
golden
brew
that
shows
lots
of
bubble
activities
throughout
and
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
chilled
pint
glass
the
modest
head
is
snow
white
but
holds
on
reasonably
and
leaves
similar
traces
of
lace
the
aroma
offers
a
mild
but
balanced
ricewheat
grain
very
clean
nothing
unusual
but
fine
for
the
style
the
flavor
brings
fairly
simple
wheat
and
light
malt
with
a
ricelemon
theme
and
maybe
even
some
sweet
corn
and
a
cardboard
kiss
but
its
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
fairly
dominant
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
very
bright
crisp
feel
very
refreshing
perhaps
overcarbonated
and
a
little
underflavored
but
adequate
to
wash
down
your
viet
namese
chow
o
the
slightly
metallic
taste
is
definitely
offputting
in
this
beer
and
to
me
makes
it
less
than
enjoyable
and
not
a
sessionable
beer
i
do
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
never
mind
more
than
one
in
a
single
session
o
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
again
on
a
dare
or
if
paid
less
than
twenty
bucks
per
sip
you
wouldnt
believe
how
many
potato
chips
i
had
to
eat
to
nullify
the
effect
on
my
tongue
i
know
this
doesnt
make
me
popular
with
the
maker
but
thats
my
true
opinion
better
luck
next
time
im
immediately
going
to
another
beer
until
the
next
time
rjt
refreshing
and
crisp
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
example
of
the
adjunct
lager
style
certainly
a
better
choice
than
tsingtao
for
you
asian
food
accompaniment
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
compare
it
to
american
adjunct
lager
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
which
is
nonoffensive
without
strong
adjunct
flavors
highly
drinkable
and
good
for
a
session
oh
man
this
isnt
too
good
got
a
cold
bottle
poured
a
small
off
white
head
that
quickly
settled
down
to
a
light
scummy
cover
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
pale
yellow
with
varying
size
bubble
trails
aroma
is
super
mild
a
little
fruit
and
maybe
malt
flavor
is
dominated
by
carbonic
tang
with
a
little
malt
fruit
some
mineral
and
adjunct
flavors
body
is
watery
and
carbonation
very
sharp
finish
is
like
flavor
and
too
long
cant
drink
anymore
actually
not
bad
for
a
food
pairing
but
not
much
different
than
other
asian
lagers
like
tsing
tao
either
quenches
thirst
though
o
the
metallic
nature
and
strong
adjunct
natures
dont
make
this
a
beer
that
i
would
want
to
try
again
had
a
couple
bottles
of
this
tonight
ice
cold
along
with
some
spicy
vietnamese
cuisine
a
nice
pairing
pours
a
typical
macro
lager
nice
lacing
and
head
retention
for
the
style
smell
is
faint
but
pleasant
lightly
sweet
and
grassyearthy
taste
follows
the
nose
goes
down
very
easy
extremely
crisp
not
bad
at
all
as
an
accompaniment
to
spicy
food
bbq
would
also
be
excellent
with
this
i
could
also
see
tossing
a
few
back
on
a
humid
day
in
the
delta
overall
drinkability
id
definitely
like
to
try
a
fresher
batch
of
this
to
give
it
a
more
accurate
rating
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
especially
from
the
horror
stories
ive
heard
about
vietnamese
beers
worth
a
shot
not
bad
o
this
beer
does
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
goes
down
refreshingly
fast
and
easy
whether
by
itself
or
w
hot
spicy
food
its
definitely
not
meant
for
overanalysis
the
33
export
presents
itself
nicely
enough
for
the
most
part
from
bottle
to
color
to
aroma
but
it
fails
badly
in
the
taste
category
simply
this
beer
gets
rotten
pretty
fast
and
thats
what
i
take
home
from
this
beer
especially
when
theres
this
lingering
aftertaste
t
smooth
and
a
little
sweet
id
rank
this
right
around
singha
as
the
quality
is
around
the
same
and
the
taste
is
similar
honey
cereal
malts
and
a
little
hint
of
grassy
hops
it
went
pretty
well
with
my
pho
this
one
pours
a
thin
bright
bright
gold
in
color
with
a
very
light
white
head
it
smells
of
light
pale
malts
and
is
very
spritzy
as
if
overcarbonated
it
tastes
really
subdued
and
features
most
faded
pale
malts
maybe
some
light
honey
and
it
has
a
light
bitterness
it
is
very
very
light
and
finishes
quickly
as
well
its
watery
thin
and
essentially
a
lager
i
assume
a
lot
of
people
drink
a
lot
of
its
just
ok
nothing
special
basic
lager
similar
to
about
35
or
so
american
beers
that
are
pretty
much
trying
to
copy
each
others
basic
lagers
o
feels
like
you
arent
drinking
a
thing
it
doesnt
taste
bad
because
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
anything
that
being
said
its
perfectly
adequate
and
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
and
never
feel
it
clear
light
golden
with
a
shock
white
head
that
leaves
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
falls
untoasted
grain
corn
grits
and
faint
green
apple
skin
in
the
nose
grainy
husky
and
slightly
sweet
to
start
with
some
creamed
cornlike
flavor
that
turns
dry
with
some
cracker
flavor
in
the
finish
i
think
this
beer
is
imported
for
the
sole
purpose
of
filling
a
need
for
vietnamese
restaurants
and
giving
vietnamese
americans
a
taste
of
home
it
doesnt
do
much
for
me
medium
light
body
with
solid
carbonation
a
decided
tang
up
front
but
it
mellows
well
enough
a
middling
example
but
not
swill
d
could
be
easily
consumed
but
due
to
bad
taste
would
not
recommend
it
to
anyone
d
i
couldnt
get
beyond
about
a
third
of
the
bottle
weak
flavors
but
nothing
horrid
im
guessing
the
brown
bottle
helped
a
bit
here
that
subtle
apple
is
there
with
corn
huskgreenand
some
very
faint
florals
the
feel
could
use
some
carbonation
or
a
bit
of
a
snap
to
it
easy
drinking
at
first
but
it
kinda
wears
on
ya
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
my
thai
food
last
night
it
was
much
better
than
the
tiger
beer
i
had
just
before
and
would
recommend
it
as
an
easy
drinking
alternative
to
american
macro
swill
d
the
watery
flavor
is
strong
with
the
supporting
flavors
a
bit
odd
and
the
apple
grows
as
the
beer
warms
but
no
hops
or
malt
flavors
come
through
to
cover
or
support
it
overall
interesting
pick
i
wouldnt
rate
it
at
the
high
end
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
asian
beers
ive
tried
cheers
d
judging
by
the
disparity
in
reviews
of
this
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
quality
control
isnt
this
brewerys
highest
priority
my
sample
was
simply
not
good
too
harsh
and
metallic
to
be
enjoyable
to
me
i
dont
think
age
was
an
issue
as
mine
was
right
in
the
middle
of
the
printed
bottled
onexpiration
date
range
not
worth
a
revisit
taste
is
rather
neutral
with
a
good
balance
on
the
finish
carbonation
supports
the
beer
initially
but
becomes
a
bit
thin
as
it
settles
decent
feel
and
finish
as
a
quick
flash
of
citrus
returns
on
the
finish
a
decent
example
of
a
rare
style
for
me
and
well
suited
to
many
culinary
styles
d
a
decent
respite
from
the
flavorful
vietnamese
food
it
was
paired
with
but
otherwise
a
very
lackluster
brew
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
very
mild
aroma
hints
of
malt
taste
is
a
bit
hard
to
describe
not
a
lot
going
on
but
some
ingrediants
i
can
not
put
my
finger
on
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
soso
drinkability
overall
a
mediocre
brew
flavors
of
light
peaches
but
flavors
are
very
quick
fragile
and
thin
and
very
rapid
finish
is
so
short
as
to
be
nonexistent
i
dont
know
reason
to
drink
this
beer
other
than
water
not
being
available
appears
bright
straw
golden
with
thin
fizzy
white
head
thin
traces
of
lace
aromat
bottle
states
that
there
is
water
malt
cereal
and
hps
as
ingredients
i
guess
beer
has
a
better
shelf
life
over
there

smells
of
rough

and
a

note
not
much
going
on
other
than
the
corn

flavor
has
a
clean
watery
sweetness
with
more
cooked

no

of
course
and
once

rice
heavy
with

like
carbonated

for
sure
thin
tiny
bubbled
tickles
the
throat
doesnt
offend
kind
of
refreshing
warm

beer
overall
the
coolest
part
about
this
beer
is
the
neck
label
and
cap
adorned
with
a
thunder
cat
like
symbol
representing
beer
wise
its
completely
forgettable
drinkability
bleh
not
recommended
as
its
both
unclean
and
fairly
unrefreshing
this
is
no
way
to
spend
valentines
day
typical
pale
fizzy
lager
with
a
pure
white
head
and
good
carbonation
smells
clean
and
even
slightly
hoppy
with
some
light
graininess
not
that
sweet
the
taste
has
a
strangely
herbal
sweetbitter
combination
along
with
some
more
graininess
almost
medicinal
in
its
bitterness
overlaid
with
adjunct
sweetness
not
pleasant
that
combo
makes
this
a
drain
pour
for
me
mouthfeel
is
acris
and
bitter
not
for
me
nikki
the
aroma
is
skunked
malt
and
somewhat
metallic
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
medium
head
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
watermelon
and
a
metallic
finish
the
palate
is
thin
overall
i
dont
like
it
because
there
is
absolutely
nothing
redeemable
about
it
figured
i
would
try
a
vietnamese
beer
as
i
havent
tried
any
before
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
tons
of
bubbles
shooting
to
the
top
and
a
nice
little
head
theres
even
a
good
amount
of
lacing
better
than
the
average
macro
so
far
the
taste
is
light
bodied
and
a
bit
odd
a
sort
of
german
taste
to
it
but
the
finish
is
just
weird
and
kind
of
has
a
funky
aftertaste
decently
drinkable
and
something
different
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fast
dissipating
white
cap
fine
bubbles
settled
to
a
thin
collar
with
a
few
wisps
covering
the
surface
of
the
beer
there
was
a
bit
of
stickage
when
the
glass
was
tilted
mostly
the
collar
just
grabbing
the
glass
and
then
settling
on
the
beer
again
once
upright
doesnt
look
bad
at
all
big
whiff
of
veggies
celery
and
cooked
corn
up
front
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
aroma
in
the
background
a
little
sour
too
not
much
going
on
in
the
flavour
department
very
low
bitterness
some
sweetness
and
fruity
esters
plus
the
vegetal
note
was
there
from
the
aroma
and
lingered
in
the
finish
there
was
a
bit
of
spiciness
from
hops
near
the
end
but
that
just
wasnt
enough
to
make
this
attractive
light
bodied
average
carbonation
that
was
a
bit
coarse
and
none
of
the
crispness
id
like
a
bit
dry
even
by
southeast
asian
industrial
lager
standards
this
wasnt
very
good
and
the
celeryveggie
character
didnt
help
not
something
id
try
again
d
ok
drinkability
better
then
anticipated
the
flavor
surprisingly
was
actually
quite
good
with
a
crisp
clean
mineral
body
that
finished
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
and
light
fruits
some
rice
and
malts
up
front
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
a
tadbit
undercarbonated
but
the
sweetened
finish
paired
well
with
my
spicy
vietnamese
dish
id
recommend
this
over
other
asian
beers
but
just
barely
still
a
decent
export
from
the
far
side
of
the
globe
pours
a
clear
gold
body
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
upon
my
first
impression
i
know
this
isnt
another
offensive
or
at
least
bland
macro
lager
33
export
is
better
than
that
however
it
is
a
fairly
bland
export
lager
an
easy
description
of
this
beer
is
that
it
tastes
like
i
imagine
barley
juice
would
its
sweet
like
fruit
juice
and
the
flavor
resembles
very
lightly
roasted
barley
worth
a
try
d
this
lager
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
very
drinkable
and
could
go
well
with
a
number
of
meals
for
the
most
part
i
usually
prefer
ales
over
lagers
but
i
will
have
to
add
this
to
my
library
of
preferred
drinks
the
drink
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
and
has
great
drinkability
d
i
may
have
a
few
but
wouldnt
the
overly
metallic
aspect
is
more
than
a
little
unpleasant
d
thee
are
easy
to
put
down
this
is
like
water
but
there
is
no
flavor
not
tasty
just
pound
em
back
like
a
beast
or
busch
had
one
this
past
weekend
while
eating
at
a
vietnamese
restaurant
in
allston
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
lots
of
carbonation
not
much
head
pale
yellow
color
with
no
noticeable
aroma
tastes
like
an
average
lager
not
much
to
complain
about
or
like
its
just
the
novelty
of
have
a
vietnamese
beer
with
some
nice
pho
or
noodle
dish
a
decent
beer
to
accompany
the
cuisine
very
average
and
much
like
the
bmcs
nothing
really
stands
out
this
was
my
first
vietnamese
beer
it
was
interesting
poured
a
pale
banana
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
smelled
faint
of
hops
and
a
little
malt
taste
was
thin
with
mild
bitter
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
nothing
special
but
nice
to
say
had
a
beer
from
vietnam
with
out
having
to
go
there
dthis
is
not
bad
for
an
asian
beer
which
tend
to
be
light
and
good
with
asian
food
export
lager
seems
way
to
dry
to
be
one
but
if
you
think
asian
lager
and
drink
it
with
food
its
a
good
choice
d
for
a
massproduced
beer
this
is
ok
nonetheless
this
doesnt
make
it
a
good
beer
d
this
is
pretty
boring
but
it
serves
as
a
perfect
foil
for
hot
vietnamese
dinners
when
you
cant
taste
anything
but
heat
anyway
why
drink
a
flavorful
beer
if
your
taste
buds
are
fried
the
carbonation
and
dryness
in
this
one
might
actually
make
the
painful
spice
even
worse
but
at
least
itll
cool
you
down
a
bit
if
downed
ice
cold
drank
okay
worked
with
the
food
a
one
done
unless
my
choices
are
limited
this
isnt
bad
but
it
is
kinda
reminiscent
of
drinking
tinny
water
i
could
see
this
being
refreshing
if
i
needed
a
refreshment
but
we
are
in
heavy
stout
season
and
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
overall
though
i
am
still
surprised
this
isnt
bad
dthis
is
probably
the
best
of
the
vietnamese
bottled
beers
but
it
really
is
nothing
special
it
did
go
down
very
quickly
in
the
hot
humid
saigon
evenings
and
paired
well
with
grilled
pork
scorpions
and
cobra
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
more
crisp
and
refreshing
than
i
expected
drinkability
is
pretty
good
certainly
would
be
true
on
a
hot
day
overall
its
pretty
average
but
honestly
better
than
i
expected
ok
this
beer
was
not
all
the
bad
a
viet
nam
version
of
budweiser
with
a
little
more
taste
it
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
and
little
head
very
refreshing
clean
taste
with
almost
no
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
carbonated
overall
it
was
pretty
good
nice
lawn
mower
beer
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
exppiration
date
of
508
pours
a
straw
yellow
eith
a
two
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
pretty
good
lace
sweet
honey
malt
aromas
and
rice
is
detected
not
a
bad
flavor
decent
malt
flavors
with
a
slight
watery
rice
mixed
in
not
huge
in
the
hops
department
but
enough
to
offset
the
sweet
although
it
is
still
on
the
sweet
side
its
clean
and
a
bit
watery
but
not
bad
much
better
than
i
expected
that
about
sums
this
one
up
pale
yellow
beer
no
head
to
speak
of
slight
grassy
aroma
but
kinda
unpleasantly
funky
taste
however
is
a
bit
better
malty
buiscuity
a
nice
touch
of
grassy
hop
not
that
bad
really
on
the
palate
nice
dry
finish
not
horrible
i
have
no
doubt
this
would
be
quite
adequate
in
steamy
vietnam
this
one
was
brewed
by
fosters
in
tiengiang
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
skunky
with
some
malt
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
all
malt
up
front
with
a
dry
and
spicy
hop
finish
nothing
special
here
but
it
is
a
pretty
decent
lager
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
that
is
very
drinkable
overall
is
refreshing
but
just
another
import
that
falls
into
that
catagory
of
the
same
lighter
flavored
beer
they
intended
this
to
be
a
lighter
beer
and
i
think
they
did
a
decent
job
d
not
a
bad
beer
it
certainly
had
an
interesting
taste
however
i
dont
feel
an
overwhelming
desire
to
grab
another
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
as
it
is
light
on
the
carbonation
and
taste
overall
easy
to
drink
with
the
spicy
vietnamese
dish
i
was
having
and
was
better
than
the
water
i
was
offered
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
hot
dish
or
a
hot
day
a
light
beer
in
color
with
virtually
no
head
very
bright
straw
color
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
and
cinnamon
fair
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
cream
ale
and
is
actually
better
than
most
macros
cereal
grains
are
also
evident
this
beer
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
good
i
could
see
where
this
beer
would
be
refreshing
after
a
day
in
the
jungle
drinkable
albeit
a
little
bland
i
could
go
for
this
beer
again
sometime
though
a
pale
bubbly
pour
with
a
bit
more
head
than
would
be
expected
into
a
pilsner
glass
so
this
isnt
the
greatest
beer
ever
brewed
but
it
went
very
well
with
a
viatnamese
meal
the
sweet
and
sour
taste
are
a
decent
compliment
to
the
spcies
of
the
meal
and
it
has
an
interesting
mouthfeel
like
a
very
mild
champagne
good
points
and
bad
but
a
decent
choice
for
something
different
served
at
the
local
vietnamese
restaurant
pours
a
clean
golden
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
and
very
little
aroma
taste
is
inoffensive
if
not
exciting
typical
bland
lager
flavor
faint
hint
of
hops
with
a
dry
finish
not
something
id
seek
out
but
better
choice
than
a
bud
or
a
miller
an
easydrinker
with
a
nice
light
flavor
it
was
better
than
expected
i
recommend
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lighter
inoffensive
session
brew
a
nice
beer
it
wasnt
very
complex
it
was
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
smell
was
heavenly
the
head
was
good
initially
but
finished
fast
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
an
excellent
drinkability
make
this
one
definetley
worth
a
try
still
for
a
random
asian
lager
this
has
character
and
is
fairly
drinkable
not
a
superstar
by
any
means
but
worth
a
try
and
not
bad
for
the
style
notes
date
brewed
and
best
by
date
stamped
on
bottle
this
one
is
only
2
months
old
as
it
was
brewed
august
5th
i
will
consider
this
the
next
time
i
see
it
fresh
i
would
choose
this
beer
over
a
bud
while
eating
vietnamese
food
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
this
is
definitely
my
goto
asian
beer
one
other
thing
ive
noticed
is
that
the
importer
for
this
brew
seems
to
be
very
much
on
the
ball
ive
seen
brewed
on
dates
that
are
only
23
weeks
old
imports
dont
get
any
better
than
that
poured
a
clear
golen
color
with
a
fairly
large
bubbly
white
head
left
a
moderate
lace
the
aroma
is
clean
with
thin
hints
of
malt
and
grassy
hop
taste
is
also
on
the
thin
side
very
similar
to
most
macros
slight
grain
and
hop
clean
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
thin
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
special
in
my
book
though
from
some
thai
restaurant
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
33
export
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
that
has
a
foil
wrapped
neckcap
sweet
adjunct
aroma
nothing
offensive
very
sweet
tasting
at
first
nothing
really
bad
about
it
just
not
good
either
probably
better
than
i
expected
which
isnt
saying
a
real
lot
i
would
buy
again
this
is
super
refreshing
simple
and
tasty
ill
say
this
a
fantastic
beer
saved
best
for
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
super
pale
straw
color
with
a
finger
width
head
that
subsides
to
a
film
that
sticks
around
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
smell
is
weak
at
best
with
no
hops
some
malt
and
i
think
some
rice
taste
is
pretty
weak
as
well
slight
hint
of
hops
and
some
maltyness
that
taste
watered
down
thin
in
the
mouth
with
some
decent
carbination
not
much
special
about
this
beer
d
its
not
offensive
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
and
certainly
wouldnt
pass
up
better
beers
for
this
but
if
it
were
offered
to
me
i
would
not
turn
it
down
being
pretty
light
and
not
very
alcoholic
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
hot
afternoon
with
a
friend
as
long
as
he
was
buying
it
would
be
a
easy
one
to
slam
on
the
90
degree
days
in
the
steamy
south
asian
areas
drinkabilitynotes
an
uninspiring
example
scarcely
a
dortmunder
drinkable
well
let
me
put
it
this
way
i
put
my
glass
down
did
a
few
other
things
and
forgot
about
it
yeah
that
says
it
all
this
is
just
a
boring
runofthemill
adjunct
lager
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
as
part
of
a
mix
sixpack
of
import
beers
from
odd
countries
skip
it
goodnight
vietnam
this
beer
might
be
a
decent
session
beer
it
is
low
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
with
the
exception
of
a
little
too
much
grainy
flavor
is
not
too
overbearing
i
doubt
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
beer
in
the
future
but
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
thank
you
mabz
for
this
opportunity
to
try
another
country
i
havent
been
impressed
with
vietnamese
beer
and
33
export
does
nothing
to
alter
my
impressions
a
colleague
who
eats
a
lot
of
vietnamese
food
at
a
local
restaurant
swears
by
this
beer
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
thanks
to
the
33
when
i
order
my
reviews
by
beer
name
this
one
will
appear
near
the
top
of
the
list
when
i
order
them
by
rating
however
it
will
be
nearly
as
close
to
the
bottom
last
swig
regretable
inedible
and
forgetable
probly
beter
out
of
the
bottle
body
is
thin
as
expected
with
active
carbonation
and
a
gritty
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
guess
it
would
go
well
with
the
food
but
not
too
great
by
itself
overall
impression
not
very
enjoyable
but
not
awful
much
better
than
the
last
vietnamese
beer
i
had
still
hard
to
recommend
d
while
this
beer
on
its
own
is
nothing
too
far
from
average
it
is
best
suited
for
drinking
either
as
a
backyard
bbq
thirst
quencher
or
as
a
pairing
to
a
nice
spicy
vietnamese
or
any
southeast
asian
meal
not
bad
for
a
plain
vanilla
beer
i
got
this
in
a
terrible
sampler
pack
from
world
market
ive
been
afraid
to
drink
it
because
of
the
other
beers
it
was
bundled
with
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
it
the
smell
is
fairly
week
but
dominated
by
sweet
malts
it
poured
with
little
head
as
it
is
lightly
carbonated
there
is
little
hops
taste
it
is
mostly
malts
it
reminds
me
of
sweeter
version
of
heineken
dark
it
has
a
clean
finish
the
color
is
very
similar
to
apple
juice
i
was
planning
on
finishing
it
off
with
spicy
food
but
it
was
good
enough
that
it
outlasted
the
food
and
made
me
wish
i
had
another
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
if
it
werent
so
hard
to
find
at
a
reasonable
price
this
would
go
well
with
spicy
food
i
think
it
had
a
strong
enough
taste
to
hold
its
own
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
but
if
youre
in
an
asian
restaurant
and
choices
are
scant
this
one
will
do
the
trick
if
not
for
the
idiosyncratic
name
33
would
have
nothing
going
for
it
if
i
was
sweating
my
balls
off
near
the
mekhong
river
id
definitely
go
for
this
brew
before
any
rot
gut
local
whiskeyrum
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
profile
considering
the
crowd
this
beer
travels
with
it
was
actually
more
enjoyable
than
a
cold
singha
the
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
and
some
yeast
floaties
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
scent
with
some
adjuncts
and
a
slightly
spicey
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
horrible
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
flavor
that
is
watered
down
and
slightly
metallic
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
has
a
dry
and
spicey
finish
not
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
is
horrible
its
the
first
beer
i
ever
tried
from
vietnam
i
hope
for
their
sake
that
there
are
others
available
it
has
less
than
average
taste
and
drinkability
im
on
my
way
to
the
sink
to
dump
this
one
its
like
im
drinking
water
that
gives
me
dyspepsia
waste
of
money
i
dont
make
a
habit
of
sampling
and
reviewing
such
poorly
rated
beers
but
ive
always
been
fascinated
by
vietnam
a
country
that
only
a
high
draft
lottery
number
kept
me
from
visiting
courtesy
of
the
us
government
over
three
decades
ago
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
body
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
that
quickly
falls
into
film
and
a
few
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
ghastly
with
burnt
plastic
a
hint
of
sulfuric
hops
and
some
corn
syrup
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
tastes
like
a
lower
tier
adjunct
lager
biscuity
maltiness
has
a
corn
syrupy
sweetness
and
the
hops
are
mildly
euroskunk
sulfuric
this
one
was
a
chore
to
finish
very
little
if
any
to
recommend
here
and
it
seems
to
be
an
adjunct
lager
rather
than
a
dortmunder
export
drinkability
guh
if
you
really
want
beer
in
vietnam
drink
heineken
it
might
not
be
real
heineken
it
might
be
if
your
lucky
but
it
will
still
taste
better
than
333
this
is
definitely
not
something
i
will
willingly
drink
again
but
it
is
not
so
offensive
it
is
best
drunk
cold
well
i
saw
this
one
for
the
1000
time
so
i
figured
it
was
time
to
finally
try
it
i
guess
you
could
say
that
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
sure
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
it
to
be
but
it
wasnt
that
good
either
the
taste
was
a
little
metalic
and
of
scalded
malt
the
alcohol
wasnt
tasteable
at
all
which
with
such
low
numbers
shouldnt
be
anyways
if
your
going
to
drink
this
beer
its
way
better
to
drink
it
cold
if
its
warm
it
just
goes
down
from
there
tried
this
months
ago
from
the
tap
at
flying
saucer
emporium
and
just
despised
it
at
the
time
this
time
received
this
as
part
of
a
beer
of
the
worlds
gift
pack
and
said
what
the
heck
actually
this
is
much
better
than
i
remember
the
head
retention
added
some
points
to
the
low
score
in
appreance
almost
flat
with
no
lacing
color
a
bit
darker
than
a
bmc
and
a
better
option
as
well
no
mouthfeel
but
easy
to
finish
and
perhaps
order
another
drinkability
drinkability
is
pretty
good
and
to
say
anything
different
would
be
a
lie
if
i
was
sweating
in
the
jungles
of
vietnam
id
kill
for
a
refreshing
brew
like
this
drinkability
definitely
one
to
avoid
unless
you
just
want
to
say
youve
had
a
beer

vietnam

nothing

90
for
a
12oz

from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
well
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
i
admit
i
bought
this
one
just
to
add
a
new
country
and
well
when
you
do
that
90
of
them
will
be
boring
lagers
while
this
one
isnt
one
that
blows
the
mind
its
not
terrible
and
if
i
ever
go
to
vietnam
id
probably
drink
it
oelergud
this
is
refreshing
beer
from
its
light
lemon
scent
to
its
ease
going
down
i
can
imagine
myself
sipping
this
one
like
lemonade
under
an
umbrella
somewhere
12
ounce
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
the
apperance
is
the
usuall
lager
yellow
but
this
one
had
little
head
a
fizzle
if
anything
the
smell
has
hints
of
sweetness
and
malts
taste
is
hints
of
everything
i
detected
some
malts
hops
and
bitterness

well
the

is

its
got
some
nice

is
pretty

as
a

o
an

a

maintained

adding

the

handsome

from
the

o
this
is
a
decent
take
on
the
style
still
not
sure
how
much
i
like
new
world
hops
working
with
german
style
lagers
seems
a
bit
discordant

unbalanced

overall
a
tasty
lager
with
good

flavors
its
worth
trying
but
i
did
not
enjoy
it
o
ive
had
this
one
several
times
it
just
isnt
my
favorite
their
pale
ales
seem
to
be
much
better
o
wv
isnt
the
beer
mecca
of
the
world
so
it
still
was
drinkable
after
driving
5
hrs
i
have
had
this
on
tap
several
times
at
various
locations
around
wv
the
first
time
i
nearly
returned
it
to
the
bar
it
was
so
incredibly
buttery
that
i
could
barely
finish
it
it
felt
as
if
i
was
drinking
melted
butter
with
a
slight
hop
presence
i
gave
it
another
try
about
6
months
later
because
i
do
want
to
see
this
brewery
succeed
due
to
the
fact
that
its
from
my
home
state
however
not
much
has
changed
with
this
brew
i
think
they
might
have
fixed
the
previous
recipe
somewhat
but
the
butter
notes
are
just
out
of
control
in
this
the
hops
are
abnormally
high
for
a
lager
and
the
aroma
isnt
exactly
pleasant
i
usually
write
fairly
detailed
notes
for
the
beers
i
try
but
there
honestly
isnt
much
to
write
home
about
this
what
is
truly
sad
about
this
is
that
i
love
their
other
beers
they
just
simply
missed
with
this
brew
extremely
well
balanced
perhaps
the
best
lager
out
of
canada
to
meet
our
lips
to
date
the
drinkability
scale
is
showing
off
the
charts
pit
this
up
blindly
against
a
fine
german
lager
and
wed
have
a
tough
time
picking
which
one
is
from
canada
lagers
personally
arent
my
favorite
style
but
its
hard
to
be
a
pint
of
yellowhead
premium
lager
on
the
rare
occasion
edmonton
has
a
hot
day
for
the
best
quality
stop
by
the
brewery
downtown
and
fill
up
a
growler
its
cheap
environmentally
friendly
and
you
get
the
freshest
possible
product
i
will
look
for
it
again
next
time
i
am
in
edmonton
o
always
glad
to
see
a
new
local
brewer
this
one
seems
to
be
made
for
the
average
joe
beer
drinker
and
while
i
am
an
average
joe
in
general
i
am
not
when
it
comes
to
beer
so
i
have
to
rate
it
average
overall
overall
this
is
way
better
than
i
remember
i
might
have
to
make
this
a
regular
part
of
my
beer
fridge
my
first
bottle
must
have
been
bad
or
perhaps
they
hadnt
figured
things
out
when
the
brewery
was
just
getting
started
glad
that
theres
another
quality
beer
in
etown
not
a
bad
beer
a
little
fuller
and
sweeter
than
i
prefer
for
a
session
lager
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
a
relatively
large
white
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
malt
with
clean
cereal
notes
is
refreshing
taste
is
also
dominated
by
clean
cereal
taste
with
lightly
sweet
ending
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
but
lacking
fresher
cereal
notes
and
maybe
some
light
crisp
hops
underwhelming
it
has
room
to
grow
if
they
work
out
the
kinks
however
for
now
i
have
no
desire
to
have
another
one
of
these
its
an
interesting
beer
definitely
not
boring
in
a
style
of
beer
that
are
usually
quite
boring
i
think
i
like
it
poured
into
a
glass
mug
three
finger
fluffy
off
white
head
on
a
deep
golden
yellow
good
head
retention
some
moderate
lacing
malty
smell
caramel
in
the
taste
sweetish
light
hop
finish
a
bit
weak
medium
body
not
bad
drinkability
no
real
flaws
but
the
sweetness
would
get
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
a
mild
but
wellbalanced
and
flavourful
germanstyle
bright
lager
im
looking
forward
to
trying
it
on
tap
this
summer
ill
give
barnburner

lagerheads
smokehouse
brewing
co
an
overall
3
25
i
probably
will
never
buy
this
beer
again
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
seems
like
a
home
brew
take
on
a
altbier
but
thats
kind
of
far
from
the
labeled
style
so
minus
points
so
is
this
lager
supposed
to
be
amberbrown
interesting
beer
but
oddly
malty
with
a
touch
of
hop
influence
feel
is
smooth
an
easy
drinker
but
frankly
this
strikes
me
mostly
as
an
odd
homebrew
as
opposed
to
a
finely
executed
version
of
the
style
mouthfeel
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
rather
sweet
finish
good
beer
but
no
where
it
should
be
this
had
the
makings
of
a
great
dortmunder
a
great
local
brewery
nice
color
and
a
cool
label
in
the
end
though
its
pretty
average
the
aroma
is
lacking
it
is
inoffensive
but
not
where
it
should
be
the
taste
is
somewhat
hoppy
but
not
nearly
as
malty
as
it
could
be
the
aftertaste
is
very
good
due
to
all
the
above
it
is
a
reasonably
good
experience
and
i
woulc
never
refuse
one
of
these
but
i
dont
intend
to
buy
it
again
pours
golden
orange
copper
body
with
a
bright
off
white
head
forming
thick
and
flowing
fast
with
carbonation
aroma
smells
horrible
like
sick
grain
gone
horribly
wrong
i
cant
even
explain
the
offness
im
smelling
in
the
nose
flavor
tastes
like
garlic
garbage
regurgitated
throwup
a
bit
of
corn
meal
off
graininess
no
hops
this
beer
sucks
asshole
and
i
cant
evenly
say
that
with
any
sort
of
finesse
officially
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
in
the
state
of
ohio
no
aging
notes
written
on
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
horrible
i
cant
stomach
another
sip
of
this
beer
completely
horrible
gut
wrenching
beer
from
medina
ohio
never
by
these
beers
if
they
taste
like
thisl
i
guess
i
will
try
this
beer
again
only
to
see
if
its
actually
this
bad
o
as
others
have
said
pretty
average
but
certainly
a
nice
beer
to
sit
sip
not
think
too
hard
about
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
chill
haze
silky
head
forms
and
recedes
away
aromas
of
lager
yeast
fruit
mild
herbal
hop
and
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
sweet
grains
faint
bitterness
and
buttery
biscuit
some
alcohol
comes
through
and
in
the
finish
a
distinct
lagery
yeast
trait
with
some
buttery
diacetyl
drinks
like
a
very
big
lager
medium
bodied
slick
feel
with
decent
carbonation
but
not
quite
crisp
overall
not
a
bad
effort
a
pretty
decent
export
lager
but
could
use
some
cleaning
up
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
at
the
local
beer
shop
ive
been
wanting
to
try
some
of
lagerheads
stuff
for
a
while
pours
a
dark
straw
color
with
a
light
white
head
head
went
away
pretty
quickly
but
would
leave
a
little
lacing
at
every
sip
more
malt
centered
than
anything
with
notes
of
caramel
in
the
background
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
that
made
the
bomber
a
little
tough
to
finish
but
overall
not
a
bad
brew
m
the
lagers
softness
doesnt
seem
like
an
assertive
export
lager
an
okay
drinker
though
the
sweetness
growing
on
me
with
each
sip
overall
an
average
brew
at
best
it
is
not
bad
but
theres
nothing
about
it
to
make
me
stand
up
and
take
notice
nonetheless
i
want
to
support
the
local
brewery
and
will
definitely
give
their
other
offerings
a
try
as
i
find
them
d
decent
at
best
theres
too
many
little
flaws
that
i
assume
could
be
easily
fixed
for
this
to
be
a
winner
but
hell
i
love
supporting
local
breweries
nonetheless
goes
down
easier
at
3am
after
a
hard
night
overall
one
of
the
best
us
brewed
dortmunders
ive
had
and
one
i
very
very
highly
recommend
fantastic
brew
here
this
is
what
craft
lager
is
all
about
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
huge
pilsner
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
green
apple
and
spicy
floral
hops
bready
crakery
sweet
maltiness
with
a
solid
shop
of
spicy
earthy
hop
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
silky
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
miss
the
malt
depth
that
one
gets
from
the
german
versions
very
drinkable
lager
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
and
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
the
style
overall
quite
nice
a
well
done
lager
soft
and
juicy
while
nice
malt
profile
mixed
with
great
hops
that
do
tend
to
get
a
little
too
bitter
on
the
back
end
but
thats
nitpicking
still
a
well
done
enjoyable
lager
webster
brewery
should
learn
from
these
guys
cheers
bottle
shockingly
the
first
dortmunder
i
have
reviewed
i
have
had
he
stlye
before
and
enjoy
it
this
beer
poured
a
clear
filtered
coppery
color
modest
head
aroma
is
very
cereally
lager
yeast
and
herbal
grassy
hops
simple
but
enticing
the
flavor
really
delivers
cereal
flavors
very
grainy
hops
are
interesting
tea
like
and
grassy
light
caramel
crisp
lager
yeast
very
agreeable
and
well
made
lighter
bodied
great
carbonation
and
crisp
feel
i
would
like
a
few
more
interpretations
of
the
style
easily
available
to
me
well
done
pours
a
dark
gold
body
with
a
creamy
head
nice
crisp
aroma
balanced
with
subtle
hops
flavor
is
real
nice
bite
of
minerals
sea
salts
orange
zest
earthy
hops
really
explodes
with
flavor
from
the
first
sip
refreshing
tempered
with
moderate
bitterness
really
enjoyed
this
one
ultimately
this
is
one
of
the
raw
grainiest
beers
ive
ever
had
different
but
i
like
it
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
sunburst
color
with
a
nice
huge
head
of
creamy
white
pebblelike
bubbles
that
sit
about
a
fingers
width
above
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
and
clean
and
a
nice
lazy
stream
of
bubbles
working
their
way
from
the
glasses
bottom
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
like
a
german
lager
grassy
noble
hops
meld
with
smooth
cracker
malts
a
touch
of
earthy
loam
and
a
very
soft
note
of
dms
that
gives
the
nose
a
touch
of
meatiness
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bready
sweet
upfront
but
quickly
begins
to
blend
with
nice
grassy
bitters
that
lead
to
a
dryer
finish
acidity
is
soft
but
slightly
citric
in
the
mouth
adding
a
pop
to
the
sip
and
the
earthiness
of
the
malt
mixed
with
the
light
dms
flavors
adds
a
nice
salty
finish
that
just
makes
me
crave
another
sip
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
smooth
crackerpilsner
malt
flavors
that
blends
with
fresh
cut
grassy
bitters
subtle
mineral
notes
and
very
faint
touches
of
vegetal
corn
the
finish
is
salty
with
a
nice
background
of
more
herbal
hop
bitters
and
even
a
touch
of
lemongrass
and
citrus
and
bread
at
times
i
get
a
burst
of
lemon
bread
in
the
finish
which
i
really
like
the
malt
makes
a
resurgence
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
nice
warm
bread
flavor
that
blends
with
the
slightly
vegetal
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
medium
in
body
with
a
fresh
crispness
that
allows
for
supreme
drinkability
carbonation
is
middling
and
just
a
touch
rough
though
i
do
like
the
prickle
on
my
tongue
once
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
with
some
saliva
on
the
edges
of
the
tongue
but
an
overall
dry
sense
from
the
saltiness
that
hits
on
the
finish
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
yet
another
beautiful
nearly
sessionable
lager
from
idle
hands
the
only
thing
i
have
against
it
is
that
the
saltiness
becomes
a
bit
much
as
i
drink
more
and
more
of
the
beer
i
almost
wish
they
would
bring
out
the
subtle
citrus
notes
a
little
more
from
the
hops
just
to
dumb
down
the
saltiness
a
little
i
actually
found
myself
thirsty
after
i
finished
the
beer
this
beer
is
tremendously
drinkable
however
even
with
its
saltiness
and
very
tasty
and
complex
for
such
a
drinkable
beer
much
like
idle
hands
other
lager
im
getting
new
flavors
with
each
sip
american
craft
beer
is
only
just
starting
to
mine
the
incredible
complexity
and
versatility
of
german
lagers
and
idle
hands
is
at
the
forefront
of
this
movement
in
new
england
another
great
fresh
lager
beer
the
more
i
drank
this
the
better
it
got
really
enjoyed
this
one
unique
tasting
lager
bready
and
creamy
didnt
like
the
smell
at
all
though
overall
and
interesting
take
on
a
lager
but
cant
say
id
be
repeating
this
in
the
future
not
overwhelming
hop
flavor
i
enjoyed
the
floral
notes
and
subtle
smell
and
taste
of
caramel
or
honey
great
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
3
floyds
brews
really
solid
beer
beats
drinking
stella
any
day
solid
beer
i
grab
when
ever
i
can
the
thing
that
really
surprised
me
about
this
one
was
the
mouthfeel
its
another
pils
sure
a
sacrificial
offering
from
every
brewery
that
needs
to
have
a
mass
appeal
beer
or
at
least
one
within
basic
style
conventions
this
is
better
than
that
though
creamy
and
dry
at
the
same
time
and
well
hoppy
for
what
it
is
not
neatly
american
or
german
or
czech
but
rather
a
stylistic
cuvee
of
all
three
which
might
be
yet
to
be
done
until
this
beer
i
get
grassy
saaz
type
hop
notes
but
also
german
pils
malt
and
a
real
basic
and
clean
american
lager
yeast
its
familiar
but
about
as
challenging
as
the
style
can
be
highly
carbonated
and
real
refreshing
but
something
different
i
always
expect
the
world
from
three
floyds
given
the
hype
and
the
rarity
and
while
this
falls
short
of
i
think
the
expectations
i
had
i
still
think
its
a
heck
of
a
pils
and
one
that
should
be
treated
as
a
one
of
a
kind
well
made
and
not
deviating
real
far
from
what
these
guys
do
well
odrinkable
crisp
lager
very
savory
reminiscent
of
tomato
soup
overall
a
rather
easy
drinking
and
tasty
lager
with
a
good
blend
of
light
sweetness
breadiness
and
hop
the
most
underrated
of
the
overrated
fff
beers
overall
a
unique
version
of
a
hopped
up
dortmunder
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
grassy
and
musty
hop
character
but
this
one
works
well
with
it
this
is
a
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
lager
with
good
hop
bite
light
lager
appearance
but
it
is
tricky
because
the
strong
hops
smell
and
taste
make
it
almost
american
pale
like
it
is
a
nice
complex
larger
if
you
like
the
flavor
of
an
ipa
with
the
harsher
bitters
this
is
my
favorite
fridge
beer
when
i
can
find
it
left
something
to
be
desired
decent
lager
with
a
smooth
mouth
feel
slight
hops
with
a
biscuity
maltyeast
taste
pours
a
clear
copper
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hops
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
dortmunder
export
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
wheat
slight
hops
slight
biscuit
and
slight
yeast
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
one
of
the
better
dortmunders
ive
ever
had
after
the
thoroughly
disappointing
dissenter
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
really
was
just
planning
to
take
a
sip
and
dump
this
clearing
up
some
room
in
the
fridge
but
darn
it
i
drank
the
whole
thing
and
enjoyed
it
i
gotta
say
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
o
very
refreshing
beer
a
simple
enjoyable
lager
slightly
hazy
with
orange
hue
tasty
for
a
lager
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
taste
hoppy
for
a
lager
with
that
slightly
skunky
finish
can
taste
the
alcohol
as
well
however
it
all
comes
together
fairly
well
my
least
favorite
of
three
floyds
which
is
a
phenomenal
brewery
purchased
a
six
pack
from
the
brewery
pours
a
strawyellow
color
and
lots
of
bubbles
can
be
seen
rushing
to
the
surface
the
head
is
short
especially
for
a
3
floyds
beer
the
nose
consists
of
bread
grain
and
a
touch
of
fruit
and
theres
a
bit
of
skunk
in
there
too
the
taste
begins
rather
sweet
with
pronounced
grain
but
finishes
heavy
on
the
breadbiscuit
flavors
this
beer
is
quite
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
as
i
havent
had
more
than
a
couple
dortmunder
beers
i
cant
say
whether
this
is
really
remarkable
but
it
is
refreshing
while
i
tried
it
solely
because
its
a
3
floyds
beer
its
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
probably
just
because
im
not
that
interested
in
the
style
o
overall
this
was
a
treat
quite
a
well
executed
dortmunder
o
a
refreshing
pils
with
a
clean
hop
character
that
i
love
about
this
style
the
price
tag
is
a
bit
much
for
jp
but
if
you
can
find
it
on
draft
somewhere
you
maybe
better
off
as
this
has
a
relativity
short
shelf
life
being
such
a
delicate
beer
nice
beer
overall
golden
hued
with
a
tightly
knit
half
inch
off
white
head
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
light
bready
grains
and
dortmunder
yeast
is
present
the
flavor
is
packed
with
sourdough
bready
grains
and
gentle
lager
yeast
the
mouth
is
fairly
dryquaffableand
crisp
o
i
liked
it
steady
as
fff
is
my
favorite
brewery
i
feel
obliged
to
review
their
lager
jinx
proof
it
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
pronounced
hops
for
a
lager
but
this
is
a
fff
signature
good
mouthfeel
but
a
bitter
finish
an
easy
drinker
for
a
hot
day
not
the
best
not
the
worst
the
initial
taste
follows
the
nose
cant
escape
fff
hops
here
and
the
finish
is
more
bitter
than
i
expected
taste
is
very
much
akin
to
a
traditional
lager
with
a
dialedup
citrus
hops
tone
very
flavorful
while
remaining
true
to
the
lager
style
well
tasty
and
worthy
of
repeat
purchase
o
this
is
a
very
very
very
good
dortmunder
a
little
too
sweet
and
tropical
for
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
provides
a
flavorful
experience
and
satisfying
dry
finish
while
still
being
reasonably
light
on
its
feet
if
youre
someone
who
appreciates
the
lager
side
of
the
beer
spectrum
this
should
be
on
your
wish
list
one
of
the
better
american
dortmunders
out
there
o
this
is
a
reasonably
good
version
of
a
very
common
style
in
the
mainstream
market
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
which
factors
i
suppose
but
i
wish
this
had
more
depth
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
a
nice
thirstquenching
lager
with
a
great
flavor
profile
very
impressive
and
quite
good
bottle
from
rebekah
thanks
pours
into
my
tulip
a
hazy
light
golden
color
half
finger
head
white
and
fluffy
but
recedes
quickly
aroma
of
hay
sweet
malt
and
honey
maybe
some
light
fruits
like
apples
and
pears
flavor
is
light
straw
a
little
dirty
lager
flavor
them
a
nice
burst
of
sweet
fruit
and
honeylike
malts
the
flavor
is
very
light
and
a
sweetness
remains
on
the
palate
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
nothing
super
exciting
but
a
solid
pilsener
overall
that
is
pretty
drinkable
this
improves
as
it
warms
a
little
and
some
papaya
and
passion
fruit
comes
out
that
is
nice
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
and
was
surprised
to
find
a
lone
six
pack
at
one
the
liquor
barns
in
louisville
ky
the
sweet
and
balanced
flavor
is
typical
of
a
dortmunder
style
but
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
great
lakes
dortmunder
this
pours
a
semihazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
earth
tones
and
grains
that
you
expect
from
a
pilsner
the
taste
is
very
strong
with
a
very
dry
grain
tone
this
has
a
lot
more
dry
hops
than
you
would
which
is
why
i
could
this
beer
would
turn
some
people
away
o
its
a
good
pale
lager
kinda
simple
and
to
the
point
but
refreshing
and
lightly
hopped
for
good
effect
overall
this
is
a
solid
lager
that
is
smooth
and
easy
drinkin
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
good
lager
id
feel
better
about
it
if
it
came
in

with
big
herbal
spiciness
as
i
put
my
nose
in
it
but
other
than
that
the
beer
has
some
great
balance
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
and
one
i
prefer
to
many
others
in
the
style
it
is
a
little
too

but
their
twists
on
this
one
took
away
from
the
drinkability
and
didnt
add
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
or
depth
that
said
perhaps
their
kettle
is
permanently
infused
with
amarillo
the
flavor
is
a
pretty
straight
reading
of
a
czech
pilsner
a
very
serviceable
and
wellexecuted
effort
roundly
dry
and
bitter
ends
with
a
sweet
balance

finish

my
favorite
japanese
beer
tasted
may
2
2010
pours
golden
with
a
white
head
this
is
an
industrial
lager
that
i
used
to
drink
a
bit
of
while
i
lived
in
japan
this
one
was
a
gift
from
the
wife
when
she
came
back
from
japan
last
summer
it
might
have
stayed
a
bit
long
in
the
can
as
there
is
a
metallic
taste
to
it
otherwise
there
is
slight
diacetyl
the
beer
is
very
light
some
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
little
malt
sweetness
this
is
a
damn
fine
foreign
brew
thanks
brian
and
diana
for
the
travel
brew
the
previous
beer
made
me
a
little
nervous
with
its
propensity
to
foam
up
and
overflow
so
i
went
with
a
more
gentle
pour
on
this
one
it
was
still
slightly
foamy
perhaps
due
to
heat
and
humidity
but
it
was
under
cantrol
all
the
same
two
fingers
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
were
the
result
and
i
watched
it
as
it
slowly
bubbled
and
popped
its
way
out
of
existence
color
was
a
gorgeous
goldenyellow
and
i
could
only
laugh
as
croesus
mammon
and
king
midas
fought
for
a
drop
nose
was
very
honeylike
very
much
like
a
clean
unadulterated
lager
from
a
can
i
am
already
a
fan
i
cannot
tell
you
how
many
aals
in
a
can
that
i
have
been
subhected
to
and
it
is
never
pleasant
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
i
caught
a
grassy
hoppiness
that
made
me
think
of
a
ger
pils
but
i
will
buy
dortmunder
finish
was
pretty
dry
a
real
gem
on
this
hot
humid
day
i
really
liked
the
grassy
finish
and
might
cansider
it
for
a
lawnmower
beer
candidate
still
in
tokyo
and
back
at
the
hostel
enjoying
some
beer
poured
from
a
11
2
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
a
touch
of
malts
taste
is
also
mild
some
malts
dry
at
the
finish
lacking
in
flavor
or
punch
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
sub
par
beer
o
one
of
the
better
macro
japanese
beers
malt
forward
beer
that
has
great
grain
notes
it
really
is
refreshing
final
thoughts
im
finding
that
the
simpler
styles
of
japanese
beer
are
done
well
but
not
quite
well
enough
to
justify
their
import
costs
i
mean
they
solidly
thump
the
macros
and
a
lot
of
the
european
import
lagers
but
arent
quite
as
good
as
local
craft
offerings
id
really
like
to
see
sapporo
bring
some
of
their
other
brews
over
to
brew
locally
not
sure
how
they
could
market
it
but
ive
been
a
fan
poured
a
slightly
hazed
bright
yellow
with
a
thin
head
of
moderate
retention
some
spotty
lacing
to
it
aroma
was
of
clove
and
citrus
taste
was
surprising
crisp
with
a
bready
note
that
shifts
intio
a
tangy
citrus
flavor
lemonygrapefruit
it
reminded
me
of
a
spiced
wheatbeer
this
was
served
very
cold
at
a
local
japanese
restaurant
the
taste
definately
improved
as
it
warmed
o
this
is
the
fourth
yebisu
brew
ive
tried
and
im
finding
that
my
first
drop
the
black
is
likely
to
remain
my
favourite
similar
in
some
ways
to
the
white
label
beer
but
with
little
to
distinguish
it
as
premium
its
a
basic
export
lager
with
some
ok
flavour
combinations
o
nothing
special
but
not
bad
probably
would
describe
it
as
average
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
a
session
beer
but
personally
i
dont
want
to
have
a
lot
of
this
beer
i
would
save
my
timemoney
for
something
i
enjoyed
more
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
the
taste
isnt
overly
special
its
not
that
bad
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
yebisu
is
one
of
my
favorite
canned
beers
to
drink
simply
because
the
malty
flavor
carries
through
even
packaged
in
such
a
medium
often
canned
beers
lose
so
much
of
their
magic
that
is
normally
found
in
bottles
or
especially
via
tap
take
guinness
as
a
perfect
example
however
as
far
as
canned
beer
goes
yebisu
is
amazing
full
of
malt
wheatflavored
with
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
goes
particularly
well
with
things
like
korean
bbq
or
curry
with
some
spice
i
often
pour
it
into
a
glass
and
any
pilsner
or
tulip
style
glass
will
do
depending
on
how
much
head
you
want
on
it
the
only
negative
side
to
this
canned
version
that
does
not
bother
me
when
it
comes
from
the
tap
is
the
excess
gas
in
the
beer
that
translates
to
some
nasty
burps
ive
had
yebisu
in
all
forms
even
from
the
brewery
in
ebisu
tokyo
and
this
only
seems
to
happen
when
i
drink
it
from
the
can
however
since
that
does
affect
my
overall
image
of
the
beer
i
do
have
to
stick
with
this
ranking
for
now
if
you
have
a
chance
to
have
it
from
the
tap
i
would
recommend
it
as
it
easily
would
rank
a
4
clean
and
go
down
well
easy
either
drinking
it
alone
or
pairing
with
some
foods
high
drinkability
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
strongenough
malt
body
to
keep
it
interesting
for
an
easydrinking
pilsner
handsdown
my
favorite
massproduced
japanese
beer
a
crisp
clean
bitter
lager
while
its
nothing
special
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
d
was
a
decent
dortmunder
that
was
drinking
really
good
and
went
really
well
paired
with
some
yakitori
and
sushi
about
as
good
as
i
expected
which
is
just
a
bit
better
than
sapporo
premium
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
found
it
for
the
same
price
or
cheaper
as
other
similar
tasting
german
or
czech
imports
we
get
in
dépanneurs
here
bitburger
konig
wernesgruner
overall
it
was
fine
totally
average
and
went
well
with
dinner
drinkable
brew
nice
change
from
the
standard
japanese
beers
worth
a
try
everything
else
about
this
lager
was
terrible
wetrope
aroma
burned
veggie
taste
sour
aftertaste
flat
body
sadly
for
me
this
was
the
last
thing
i
consumed
before
leaving
japan
blech
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
d
good
is
this
really
one
of
the
best
japanese
lagers
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
for
another
round
again
drinkability
is
pretty
high
on
this
one
due
to
its
lightness
im
quite
surprised
by
what
i
thought
would
be
just
your
average
lager
overall
a
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
lager
md
lightly
carbonated
lightbodied
the
flavour
profile
gears
towards
the
dry
and
bitter
side
of
hops
not
unlike
the
german
pilsener
style
i
once
tried
the
bottle
version
and
to
my
best
collection
this
canned
version
is
not
too
different
all
in
all
a
pretty
decentlymade
dry
lager
drinkablity
very
well
crafted
allmalt
beer
deserves
a
place
alongside
the
worlds
great
beers
d
overall
doesnt
compare
to
most
dortmunders
ive
tried
but
is
drinkable
in
comparison
to
the
adjunct
lagers
in
the
states
the
bitterness
and
dms
content
is
a
little
much
for
the
style
and
there
is
a
lack
of
malt
complexity
will
pass
on
further
yebisus
d
ive
certainly
had
better
dortmunders
this
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
had
it
with
some
chinese
food
and
it
seemed
to
work
there
if
it
werent
for
the
price
4
99
per
bottle
this
would
likely
be
a
frequent
summer
purchase
for
me
unfortunately
i
am
reviewing
this
on
a
cold
autumns
day
it
would
be
better
appreciated
and
possibly
have
scored
higher
in
summer
i
was
in
japan
and
did
try
and
find
a
whole
bunch
of
beers
and
recall
this
one
being
the
best
of
the
bunch
too
bad
its
rather
pricey
stateside
very
nicely
done
certainly
worth
trying
good
beer
though
i
prefer
much
more
hop
bite
still
i
would
drink
this
again
d
i
find
japanese
beers
as
a
whole
very
drinkable
due
to
their
light
flavors
and
body
my
bottle
was
a
strange
volume
of
334
ml
and
i
liked
the
large
eared
fisherman
on
the
label
medium
body
with
some
wateriness
to
the
mouthfeel
other
than
that
its
a
very
easy
too
drink
sessionable
type
lager
i
prefer
it
to
the
canned
sapporo
ive
had
in
the
past
dsurprisingly
not
bad
a
good
choice
at
many
japanese
restaurants
or
izakayas
though
a
bit
more
expensive
this
is
a
simple
yet
flavorful
pale
lager
sadly
the
high
price
tag
for
a
single
bottle
of
this
will
have
me
choosing
sapporosapporo
reserve
over
this
the
next
time
i
want
a
japanese
lager
make
sure
to
let
this
one
warms
up
its
nothing
incredibly
special
but
for
a
massproduced
beer
its
pretty
respectable
golden
colour
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
floral
aroma
with
sweet
honey
some
caramel
and
honey
in
the
flavour
a
very
decent
malt
profile
that
had
hints
of
dead
guy
to
it
but
with
far
toned
down
hoppiness
medium
body
with
lighter
than
expected
carbonation
this
is
a
very
decent
offering
from
a
macro
and
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
a
major
producer
as
it
says
on
the
label
aroma
is
mostly
pleasant
malt
with
some
floral
character
flavour
is
similiar
with
rich
malt
and
bittery
finish
maybe
with
some
sourness
on
the
back
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
very
good
for
the
mainstream
beer
its
has
a
nice
malt
profile
something
you
wont
find
in
the
rice
beers
it
also
has
a
slight
yeast
flavor
something
ive
never
really
came
across
in
lagers
its
a
unique
beer
and
quite
tasty
enjoyed
with
some
sushi
if
every
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
pleasant
and
refreshing
beer
in
dortmunderstyle
lager
from
the
japanese
sapporo
notes
if
the
price
was
right
this
could
be
a
staple
sessioner
in
the
beer
fridge
but
at
roughly
18
a
sixer
ill
pass
d
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
just
a
nice
well
balanced
and
refreshing
lager
i
think
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
of
the
higher
end
japanese
macro
lagers
family
thought
i
was
weird
when
i
was
taking
notes
on
this
beer
did
not
understand
the
concept
a
friend
brought
this
to
me
directly
from
tokyo
japan
this
beer
was
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
the
head
was
decent
and
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
faint
the
taste
brought
out
a
smoky
malt
the
hops
seemed
only
to
be
there
for
bittering
very
light
hop
flavor
the
flavor
also
seemed
to
bring
out
the
flavor
of
cigarettes
d
very
drinkable
its
a
much
better
beer
than
your
standard
japanese
rice
lagers
the
appearance
was
really
good
surprisingly
good
lacing
on
the
glass
and
nice
drylooking
foam
in
general
the
aroma
is
neutral
malty
pretty
good
the
flavor
was
all
malt
nice
for
the
style
very
drinkable
i
had
two
in
quick
succession
good
crisp
refreshing
but
bitter
nice
amber
color
smells
kinda
nutty
wheaty
something
like
that
before
it
was
even
described
to
me
as
one
of
japans
finer
beers
i
thought
this
beer
was
one
of
the
best
id
had
here
which
is
of
course
not
saying
much
quite
drinkable
and
one
of
the
beeriest
beers
in
japan
as
most
seem
to
taste
like
expired
alcoholic
tonic
water
pours
amber
tinted
black
color
with
brownish
head
aroma
is
porterish
with
some
roastyness
to
it
high
carbonation
for
a
dark
beer
taste
is
on
the
light
side
with
just
hints
of
dark
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
bit
of
mild
hop
flavor
but
with
such
an
overall
lightness
this
beer
does
not
really
need
a
lot
of
hops
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
nothing
really
special
about
it
but
a
decent
flavor
and
high
drinkability
feels
a
lot
lighter
than
it
looks
due
to
thin
body
and
high
carbonation
i
could
go
through
a
few
of
these
with
some
japanese
bbq
then
for
the
first
taste
and
first
surprise
it
was
actually
surprisingly
flavoursome
a
lot
of
hops
and
a
fair
herby
flavour
to
it
slightest
sourness
on
the
back
palatte
but
there
really
isnt
much
of
a
back
palatte
anyway
so
its
quite
noticeable
none
of
this
was
really
expected
given
the
nose
and
appearance
it
didnt
really
taste
like
the
standard
chugging
lager
i
had
expected
although
there
were
touches
of
that
flavour
in
there
i
have
to
say
its
not
the
most
pleasanttasting
beer
ive
ever
drunk
slightly
too
sour
for
my
taste
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
and
still
not
as
flavoursome
as
i
like
having
said
that
though
this
is
worthy
of
a
lot
more
respect
than
the
watery
swills
known
as
kirin
ichiban
or
yanjing
to
name
just
two
its
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
it
certainly
is
a
respectable
drinking
lager
smooth
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
expected
but
very
welcome
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
but
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
the
beer
to
drink
with
sushi
or
other
japanese
cuisine
i
picked
this
up
on
a
layover
at
narita
airport
on
my
way
back
to
the
states
from
korea
i
loved
the
fat
fisherman
in
the
can
design
poured
fairly
light
maybe
more
toward
yellow
than
gold
with
minimal
scent
but
not
grainy
or
skunky
like
many
japanese
beer
taste
was
upbeat
and
the
beer
tasted
very
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
looks
like
they
have
some
quality
water
supplies
at
sapporo
after
all
a
surprisingly
good
japanese
beer
that
doesnt
offer
tons
of
flavor
but
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
pleasant
goodbye
from
the
land
of
the
rising
sun
super
premium
yebisu
stout
draft
everything
except
yebisu
is
a
misnomer
grew
on
me
with
drinking
it
will
never
make
me
forget
my
favorites
of
the
style
but
was
enjoyable
while
it
lasted
it
makes
no
serious
missteps
and
is
worth
a
look
if
you
happen
to
run
across
a
bottle
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
was
sold
to
me
as
a
stout
at
rfds
which
i
was
not
happy
about
when
i
saw
the
pour
but
i
decided
to
try
it
anyways
crisp
slightly
dry
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
very
pleasant
session
beer
if
nothing
else
though
theres
plenty
of
other
beers
id
buy
for
the
price
that
was
charged
16
ounce
bottle
not
the
most
interesting
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
if
i
was
in
japan
at
least
i
would
know
of
a
beer
i
might
be
able
to
locate
that
had
a
bit
of
flavor
the
head
is
dense
the
color
pale
golden
with
an
apparently
high
level
of
carbonation
a
very
tasty
brew
the
fruityness
of
peaches
and
lemon
give
the
beer
a
very
round
mouthfeel
with
maybe
a
fig
like
dryness
hops
encircle
the
palate
in
a
nicely
balanced
way
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
drinkability
is
no
more
than
average
not
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
spicy
food
as
the
sweetness
will
not
help
cut
the
heat
overall
drinkability
was
pretty
good
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
wouldnt
if
a
different
beer
was
present
it
tastes
great
though
with
some
nice
crisp
hoppy

i
dont
mean
to
go
on
a
rant
here
but
stout
draft
is
confusing
as
mentioned
this
has
a
little
more
flavor
that
its
brethren
but
this
is
a
pretty
unremarkable
beer
the
flavor
was
crisp
clean
and
quite
drinkable
i
would
probably
go
for
this
if
i
see
it
in
a
japanese
restaurant
white
2
cm
head
on
a
yellow
gold
body
leafy
malty
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
restina
firm
lasting
bitterness
but
more
than
the
average
japanese
lager
a
little
husky
rich
flavor
significantly
different
from
the
common
japanese
swill
but
nothing
amazing
this
lager
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
thick
creamy
white
foam
that
had
good
staying
power
and
left
a
coating
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
faint
and
malty
the
taste
was
light
slightly
sweet
malt
hints
of
hops
floral
and
bitter
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
mildly
hoppy
this
was
an
easydrinking
lager
on

poured
a
deep
yelow
color
with
minimal
headsmel
of
pretty
much
nothing
maybe
a
tad
of
sweetness
taste
was
malty
and
maybe
some
apple
tartness
but
pretty
weak
in
the
flavor
departmenthighly
carbonated
and
a
little
thin
on
the
mouth
was
expecting
more
not
to
impressed
with
this
honey
colored
slightly
cloudy
hardly
any
head
or
flavor
really
wasnt
too
bad
once
it
warmed
up
a
little
i
like
japanese
beer
but
this
one
is
not
a
quality
brew
served
its
purpose
which
was
to
wash
down
some
japanese
food
i
cant
say
enough
enough
about
this
beer
for
the
required
250
characters
not
bad
but
not
special
in
any
way
other
than
being
an
all
malt
japanese
macro
brew
pours
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
stale
grains
and
a
bit
of
cooked
corn
taste
is
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
up
front
followed
by
some
notes
of
wet
hay
and
musty
grains
some
mildly
bitter
hops
are
present
in
the
end
leading
to
a
dry
finish
better
than
many
other
asian
beers
ive
had
its
still
no
better
than
an
average
brew
thick
white
head
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
golden
color
nose
is
clearly
skunky
and
not
stoutlike
indeed
the
label
has
stout
draft
but
this
is
a
whole
new
definition
of
stout
not
dark
nor
mediumheavy
bodied
label
is
veeery
misleading
and
wont
be
purchased
again
even
at
275
for
16oz
i
smell
muchu
roastiu
nutsu
along
with
proof
of
lager
the
taste
starts
off
with
candy
giving
way
to
a
sourish
nutty
middle
the
finish
is
tangy
and
slightly
sour
this
is
actually
pretty
darn
good
yebisu
stout
draft
served
from
a
fairly
fancy
sixteenounce
bottle
stout
draft
no
not
guinness
but
rather
a
darkish
gold
color
under
a
very
impressive
thick
white
foamy
head
left
some
fairly
thick
lacing
down
the
side
as
well
the
aroma
is
fairly
impressive
some
skunk
some
malts
the
taste
is
impressive
and
hard
to
compare
to
other
beers
i
can
taste
somewhat
of
a
pronounced
floralvegetable
taste
which
follows
up
closely
with
bready
malts
at
the
end
it
is
fairly
clean
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
1
pint
bottle
has
particulates
in
it
leading
me
to
believe
it
to
have
some
bottle
conditioning
pours
golden
with
just
a
hint
of
amber
to
the
color
the
head
is
thick
and
luxurious
settling
quickly
to
a
fine
lace
on
the
glass
with
the
faintest
hint
of
tan
color
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
very
fresh
and
bitter
hops
the
nose
released
from
the
head
is
quite
good
the
1st
sip
is
malty
and
sweet
this
is
quite
good
malt
with
hops
and
a
distinctive
bitter
aftertaste
well
balanced
beer
though
the
finish
builds
to
a
powerful
bitter
but
i
like
bitter
so
hoo
rahhh
mouthfeel
is
like
liquid
silk
verrrrry
smooooooth
beer
i
am
so
happy
i
tried
this
one
not
quite
a
5
but
damn
close
especially
for
an
asian
beer
the
name
itself
is
quite
a
misnomer
calling
it
a
stout
when
its
anything
but
that
its
mildly
spritzy
almost
fruity
and
delivers
a
heck
of
a
punch
in
the
aftertaste
department
its
not
a
beer
that
im
wild
about
simply
drinking
on
its
own
but
as
an
accompaniment
with
some
great
food
this
beer
is
definitely
a
winner
the
average
pour
a
golden
yellow
the
head
modest
in
size
bright
white
frothy
the
lace
a
fine
sheet
to
coat
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
lightly
sweet
crisp
and
clean
sweet
malt
start
top
cadaverous
finish
is
strikingly
acidic
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
aftertaste
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
snowwhite
head
and
spectacular
clouds
of
rising
bubbles
lots
of
thick
sticky
lace
nice
aroma
of
sweet
malts
grain
and
hops
taste
begins
with
grain
flavors
and
a
sting
of
carbonation
mild
bitterness
and
dry
characteristic
appear
midway
through
slight
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
metallic
bitterness
bring
the
taste
to
a
close
an
eminently
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
anyway
this
is
definitely
the
best
asian
beer
i
have
come
across
so
far
but
still
not
a
great
brew
still
i
think
sapporo
may
be
on
to
something
pours
a
very
orange
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
medium
sweet
malt
aroma
lightly
sweet
malt
flavor
and
medium
effervescence
there
was
some
hops
in
the
finish
but
everything
seemed
understated
about
this
beer
nothing
really
stood
out
but
if
i
am
in
japan
i
will
order
this
before
a
sapporo
or
kirin
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
sinks
quickly
and
lots
of
yeasties
floating
around
as
i
didnt
know
the
beer
was
bottle
conditioned
when
i
was
pouring
it
slightly
sweet
malt
smell
with
a
husky
grain
quality
to
it
the
beer
has
a
very
dry
and
grainy
start
to
it
that
makes
it
rather
refreshing
and
quenching
the
brew
retains
this
excellent
dryness
until
a
short
and
sweet
malt
burst
at
the
end
comes
through
it
is
then
back
to
the
dryness
for
the
slight
lingering
finish
however
the
graininess
provides
a
very
dry
and
crisp
mouthfeel
which
makes
the
brew
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
can
imagine
that
this
would
go
excellent
with
sushi
and
other
japanese
foods
the
allmalt
on
the
label
is
a
misnomer
to
a
true
malt
lover
guess
yebisu
is
a
malty
beer
compared
to
other
to
japanese
zymurgical
efforts
this
beer
is
dry
with
a
light
malty
mouth
taste
and
feel
the
hops
too
provide
a
mild
aftertaste
to
the
palate
all
in
all
a
decent
refreshing
flavor
served
ice
cold
this
light
beer
could
be
a
thirst
quencher
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
its
style
dry
as
you
would
expect
malty
and
refreshing
deep
gold
with
a
very
thin
head
malty
smell
and
flavor
with
a
balancing
hop
bitterness
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
highly
carbonated
there
just
might
be
no
better
compliment
to
a
good
sushi
dinner
like
everyone
else
i
had
this
at
a
japanese
restaurant
last
night
it
was
definately
an
above
average
lager
what
struck
me
was
how
different
in
a
good
way
a
massproduced
lager
can
be
without
the
use
of
adjuncts
hoppier
maltier
creamier
than
any
us
macro
enjoyable
i
didnt
even
know
this
beer
existed
until
last
night
at
a
sushi
restaurant
the
label
caught
my
eye
all
malt
making
it
unusual
for
japanese
beer
i
tried
it
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
its
darker
in
color
than
other
japanese
lagers
the
hop
aroma
is
actually
fairly
strong
and
the
malt
smell
is
there
too
its
has
a
pleasantly
sweet
taste
and
is
not
as
dry
as
other
japanese
beers
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
seek
it
out
next
time
youre
out
for
sushi
nice
lager
had
a
lot
worse
floral
nose
creamy
palet
not
bad
but
prety
average
thanks
to
yukiko
ueyama
of
sapporo
usa
inc
for
the
fresh
samples
golden
color
malty
and
delicious
o
pass
overall
pretty
solid
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
flensburger
and
whilst
its
unlikely
to
win
any
prizes
for
depth
or
complexity
the
fact
remains
that
its
a
good
crisptasting
lager
flensburger
gold
has
a
thin
white
head
a
mostly
clear
bubbly
golden
appearance
and
some
minor
lacing
left
behind
you
can
upon
close
inspection
see
some
fine
white
specs
roiling
about
the
beer
so
it
is
not
super
filtered
aroma
is
of
rich
pungent
sweet
sour
barley
malt
and
a
slight
grass
taste
is
of
the
same
thing
with
a
noticeable
biscuit
note
across
the
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
flensburger
gold
finishes
crisp
and
refreshing
no
complaints
here
rjt
this
is
an
export
lager
so
its
not
gonna
have
earth
shattering
bold
flavors
its
gonna
be
a
malt
tilted
more
subtle
lager
and
should
be
reviewed
as
such
there
done
with
my
rant
pours
a
pale
light
golden
with
a
thinner
white
head
in
my
stein
aromas
of
honey
malts
and
iron
with
a
bit
toasted
grain
flavors
are
pretty
dry
and
grainy
at
the
onset
with
a
little
of
the
german
iron
element
to
ithops
are
subtle
and
light
with
mild
sweetness
in
the
finish
no
frills
but
easy
drinkinga
no
brainer
for
a
hot
day
like
today
o
loads
of
taste
and
very
drinkable
its
a
great
alternative
to
the
german
pilsener
and
at
times
its
so
sweet
and
fruity
that
you
get
some
of
the
english
pale
ale
sweet
twang
its
perhaps
a
bit
watery
but
the
taste
is
fullstrength
so
it
works
out
just
fine
a
beer
i
will
definitely
grab
again
it
has
decent
flavor
and
is
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
what
beer
is
all
about
barley
yeast
subtle
but
simple
flavors
the
only
way
this
beer
could
be
better
to
me
a
tiny
tiny
bit
less
maltiness
overall
a
great
german
lager
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
try
it
this
one
just
slides
down
the
throat
the
germans
know
how
to
brew
a
clean
lager
for
shure
o
this
is
a
nice
dortmunder
with
a
little
of
everything
not
bad
at
all
o
on
the
whole
this
is
an
average
undistinguished
euro
lager
very
forgettable
i
poured
this
smelly
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
dark
blond
and
the
beer
poured
a
big
white
head
however
that
head
went
away
fast
the
beer
had
a
real
pop
to
it
when
opened
the
beer
was
really
stinky
smelling
not
typical
skunk
smell
but
just
stunk
beer
was
a
little
sweet
tasting
had
good
lacing
also
besides
the
smell
i
would
buy
again
overall
this
beer
was
a
conundrum
for
me
looked
okay
out
of
the
bottle
it
brought
you
in
with
the
nose
but
left
you
hanging
with
the
taste
profile
expecting
to
have
an
awful
drink
it
was
clean
and
didnt
leave
anything
unwanted
very
different
from
the
shiner
frost
that
i
previously
tried
cant
wait
to
trying
out
some
more
dortmunder
style
beers
to
figure
this
one
out
dont
know
that
this
has
the
presence
to
be
called
a
dortmunder
though
it
is
pretty
chewy
this
comes
at
the
cost
of
hops
which
are
largely
awol
adds
up
to
a
pleasant
but
indistinct
package
overall
just
a
bit
too
much
sweet
malt
flavor
for
my
palate
otherwise
a
decent
lager
this
is
a
little
sweeter
than
many
german
lagers
but
it
is
rich
and
delicious
nonetheless
my
bottle
is
not
clear
and
multiple
stores
that
carry
this
are
not
carrying
any
of
this
line
in
clear
bottles
i
tried
the
wheat
previously
and
liked
it
and
find
this
quite
good
as
well
easy
and
high
drinkable
thought
its
clean
character
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
grass
the
flavor
is
grass
and
grain
with
a
little
something
that
tastes
like
peanuts
mixed
in
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
there
is
nothing
good
going
on
with
this
beer
definitely
not
one
to
seek
out
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
lager
but
i
confess
to
liking
the
style
in
general
pours
rich
golden
color
no
haze
with
white
head
up
top
nose
is
light
but
has
a
soft
grainy
character
on
the
palate
theres
a
moderately
flavorful
malt
component
with
some
herbalmetallic
hops
to
round
it
out
nicely
nice
little
hop
spice
finishes
on
the
dry
side
a
little
for
me
i
mean
it
is
what
it
is
it
is
a
cheap
export
lager
dont
expect
a
munchiner
helles
over
here
still
the
beer
is
unique
and
i
will
give
it
that
overall
it
was
a
nice
experience
having
the
flensburger
gold
i
can
have
plenty
of
them
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
of
the
dortmunders
out
there
before
i
give
a
final
verdict
on
this
one
drinkability
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
worth
a
taste
this
one
comes
at
a
good
price
too
so
its
one
that
could
be
had
affordably
over
and
over
saw
this
at
my
local
beer
distributor
ive
alw
its
a
nice
beer
and
itd
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
them
in
a
session
but
id
much
rather
spend
my
money
on
bigger
bolder
beers
decent
drinkability
nothing
outstanding
but
a
decent
beer
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
its
very
drinkable
when
compared
to
other
low
abv
lighter
beers
ive
had
that
are
just
horrible
its
pretty
drinkable
great
for
a
lighter
beer
i
would
just
need
too
many
dortmunder
guess
its
my
first
one
side
note
i
plan
on
buying
much
more
of
this
beer
not
only
because
i
enjoyed
it
but
because
of
the
unique
bottle
i
plan
on
homebrewing
again
and
these
are
the
kind
of
bottles
that
will
save
you
money
on
caps
grolsh
bottles
are
the
same
but
i
dont
care
fro
grolsh
so
this
is
a
welcome
alternative
at
1
50
a
bottle
proper
and
just
above
average
had
a
first
bottle
and
a
bottle
about
a
year
old
nose
is
quite
nice
on
both
something
resembling
a
musty
twig
woodiness
quite
earthy
not
a
balance
malt
quality
some
bit
of
honey
finish
that
is
nice
not
as
resilient
as
some
though
the
age
gave
the
fruit
of
the
matter
a
bit
more
acidic
a
quality
doesnt
really
bring
out
anything
palatable
got
this
bottle
a
few
weeks
ago
at
surdyks
in
minneapolis
poured
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
with
a
little
lace
color
is
a
slightly
tarnished
clear
brass
aroma
was
very
nice
reminded
me
of
walking
by
our
local
regional
brewery
of
cooking
malt
and
a
little
hops
fresh
flavors
the
same
plus
some
extra
sweetness
heavy
grain
flavor
with
a
little
bread
dough
good
body
from
all
the
malt
decent
carbonation
finish
is
short
to
medium
and
like
the
flavor
of
eating
malted
grain
not
bad
but
a
little
too
much
simple
malt
flavor
for
my
taste
the
taste
is
brisk
and
snappy
with
a
pale
toasty
malt
flavor
hops
come
in
and
add
a
slight
bittering
on
the
finish
to
offset
some
of
the
malty
sweetness
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
packed
into
this
brew
and
would
be
an
excellent
choice
to
give
to
a
bmc
drinking
friend
good
price
tag
at
only
a
buck
and
a
half
for
a
single
flenburger
gold
poured
not
surprisingly
gold
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
malty
with
almost
no
hops
i
found
the
nose
to
not
be
very
fresh
smelling
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
very
little
hop
bite
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
light
and
to
me
seemed
to
lack
carbonation
a
bit
could
have
been
a
bit
more
crisp
drinkability
was
good
overall
this
was
a
decent
lager
more
of
a
novelty
with
its
ceramic
pop
top
at

a
bottle
i
will
probably
only
buy
this
on
rare
occasions
but
the
bottles
are
keepers
for
home
brewing
1x
poured
from
a
12oz
dark
brown
fliptop
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
murky
gold
color
with
a
large
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
there
is
a
grainy
smell
with
a
strong
feel
of
apples
the
taste
is
a
bit
watered
down
drinks
really
easy
with
the
apple
taste
up
front
and
a
bitter
aftertaste
im
not
really
digging
on
this
one
too
watery
and
light
for
my
tastes
pours
slightly
foggy
gold
sweet
grains
on
the
nose
seems
like
a
touch
of
apples
as
well
a
bit
too
sweet
out
of
balance
feel
is
sticky
and
a
bit
slick
lower
carbonation
this
is
just
okay
at
best
way
too
out
of
balance
on
the
sweet
and
not
really
motivating
me
to
finish
it
have
a
golden
color
in
the
smell
are
essences
of
grains
and
caramel
good
foam
quantity
of
alcohol
and
body
acceptable
the
taste
is
good
combines
a
smooth
bitter
with
malts
with
an
accentuated
and
fresh
sensation
and
carbonation
has
a
cork
species
instead
of
bottlecap
tasty
to
enjoy
it
with
fish
or
sea
food
the
mouthfeel
its
not
very
good
mouth
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
smooth
the
sweet
side
finishes
with
some
bitter
flavor
good
for
your
first
step
in
to
the
german
beers
tastes
much
more
fresh
relatively
speaking
the
malt
is
sweet
zippy
and
fruity
like
gum
the
hops
just
are
barely
there
whether
they
got
burned
off
from
age
or
they
were
never
there
is
a
matter
for
god
to
figure
out
the
taste
is
mostly
toasted
malts
adjunct
sweetner
some
hoppiness
on
the
backend
that
dries
things
out
a
bit
there
is
a
definite
crispness
to
the
beer
and
a
honey
like
taste
in
the
mid
section
more
sweet
malts
come
through
as
the
beer
settles
this
is
a
slightly
better
than
average
lager
nothing
more
nothing
less
there
is
a
modest
degree
of
carbonation
and
the
aftertaste
is
quite
slight
a
refreshing
lager
but
not
in
my
top
ten
the
appearance
is
golden
with
an
adequate
creamcolored
head
the
smell
is
very
suttle
a
hint
of
malts
toasty
it
tastes
bitter
with
a
hint
of
wheat
not
much
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
just
a
little
acidic
drinkability
is
just
average
because
although
it
is
rather
smooth
theres
not
much
taste
or
smell
avoidable
d
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
with
more
flavor
than
us
light
lagers
actually
went
well
with
a
piece
of
cheesecake
i
ate
while
drinking
this
from
a
clear
swingtopped
33
cl
bottle
the
color
on
this
beer
is
a
rich
yellowgold
with
nice
transparency
disappointingly
the
head
is
shallow
and
filmthin
nice
continental
hop
aroma
but
very
straightforward
theres
a
little
grain
and
faint
faint
smells
in
the
back
of
the
nose
the
beer
is
soft
and
a
bit
sweet
the
sense
of
sweetness
intensifies
as
the
beer
warms
the
taste
has
a
little
fresh
bread
and
yeast
flavors
as
well
medium
body
and
relatively
low
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
straightforward
and
satisfying
beer
its
nothing
extraordinary
but
its
well
made
and
enjoyable
in
and
of
itself
hazy
pale
bronze
color
with
a
fluffy
white
crusty
two
fingers
showing
really
good
retention
aroma
is
generally
spicy
and
bitter
hops
honey
sweetness
and
with
caramel
malt
and
nuttiness
at
a
lesser
degree
very
dry
husky
grain
yeasty
sourness
that
fades
midway
through
a
steady
bitterness
and
honey
notes
assertively
dry
and
the
flavor
is
gone
almost
before
swallowed
leaving
nothing
but
some
dry
herbals
in
the
finish
thin
watery
mouthfeel
with
some
crisp
medium
carbonation
not
overly
exciting
but
good
for
the
style
and
very
quaffable
pours
a
pleasing
gold
colour
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
that
lasts
a
good
way
through
the
beer
and
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
malt
is
very
noticeable
in
both
smell
and
flavour
but
has
enough
hops
to
cancel
out
the
sweetness
crisp
and
clean
but
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
me
of
all
the
flensburgers
ive
found
this
to
be
the
best
session
beer
as
its
not
too
strongly
flavoured
like
the
pilsener
and
dunkel
and
slips
down
a
little
easier
than
the
hef
d
good
drinkability
i
am
liking
this
german
brewery
with
the
cool
little
bottles
flensburger
gold
indeed
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
from
a
clear
swing
top
bottle
malt
is
definitely
noticeable
in
the
aroma
in
a
pleasant
way
kind
of
a
cracker
like
malt
flavor
dominates
there
are
some
hops
balancing
it
out
thankfully
no
hints
of
skunk
which
i
feared
due
to
the
clear
bottle
pleasant
beer
i
could
probably
session
this
golden
body
lots
of
carbonation
surfacing
slowly
a
one
finger
white
cap
of
froth
sticks
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
bready
malts
hay
and
grainy
sweetness
crisp
flavor
of
cracker
like
breadiness
sweet
dough
and
smooth
malts
hops
add
a
dryness
to
it
all
nicely
done
mouthfeel
is
crisp
body
is
medium
always
good
to
find
another
well
done
dortmund
style
lager
theres
simply
not
enough
of
them
around
pours
a
dark
honey
with
a
frothed
head
that
goes
down
to
thin
layer
of
white
over
the
body
leaves
some
interesting
lacing
patterns
bready
malts
with
hints
of
honey
and
floral
hops
are
in
the
nose
the
malt
is
pretty
sturdy
and
there
are
present
some
floral
and
tealike
hops
what
knocks
the
taste
down
is
a
somewhat
present
ethanol
character
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
body
and
mildly
carbonated
solid
drinker
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
again
i
wonder
about
the
shelflife
so
i
am
sure
that
there
will
be
some
bad
reviews
come
in
from
this
beer
know
that
this
style
is
fragile
and
it
wont
hold
up
to
the
heat
and
fluorescent
lights
that
it
will
likely
get
in
the
majority
of
stores
that
will
stock
it
i
think
that
the
clear
bottle
was
a
bad
move
on
the
part
of
the
brewer
but
a
fresh
example
of
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
one
as
dortmunders
go
its
a
keeper
an
alright
beer
with
no
obvious
flaws
but
nothing
about
it
stands
out
drinkabilitynotes
pleasant
and
drinkable
although
mediocre
for
a
german
beer
flensburger
gold
is
my
first
beer
from
a
german
brewery
that
i
had
no
knowledge
of
until
this
week
when
i
spotted
a
few
of
their
offerings
in
a
local
beer
store
if
this
one
is
representative
its
no
wonder
that
they
havent
gotten
more
ink
or
whatever
the
internet
equivalent
of
ink
is
ill
be
interested
to
see
if
some
of
the
other
styles
from
flensburger
brauerei
fare
any
better
ph
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
was
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
this
is
an
ok
sessionable
beer
overall
impression
a
mexican
style
lager
from
germany
enjoyable
and
interesting
but
not
one
id
crave
bottle
color
may
matter
i
really
liked
the

i
usually
like
a
malty
lager
but
often
find
the
vienna
style
too
sweet
i
think
this
one
does
a
great
job
of
mixing
the
two
its
grain
driven
more
than
the
same
old
base
pils
malt
a
tad
sweet
but
way
more
drinkable
than
the
vienna
types
just
darker
than
golden
not
much
head
but
a
really
nice
carbonation
on
the
palate
some
body
for
a
pale
lager
creamy
a
little
too
but
still
crispy
in
the
finish
easily
my
favorite
if
the
beers
i
had
from
berghoff
this
week
and
while
still
a
real
basic
lager
it
has
some
real
character
allinall
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
i
mistakenly
let
this
warm
a
bit
before
pouring
corn
comes
out
more
poured
with
a
nice
large
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
light
cover
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
corn
first
then
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
flavors
very
similar
to
nose
but
strong
carbonation
adds
significant
tang
body
and
carbonation
are
ok
finish
is
a
little
like
flavor
but
morphs
into
something
not
as
pleasant
and
too
long
overall
nice
refreshing
beer
my
first
dortmunder
it
reminds
me
of
a
lot
of
european
lagers
ive
had
over
the
years
nothing
especially
distinctive
but
well
executed
4
paws
if
you
enjoy
a
classic
lager
you
will
enjoy
this
however
it
does
not
distinguish
itself
dramatically
from
a
decent
cheaper
american
version
overall
this
beer
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
that
i
love
german
lagers
incredibly
delicious
light
and
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
on
the
palate
are
just
a
few
of
the
reasons
that
the
germans
have
their
reputation
for
beer
and
this
beer
is
stellar
on
all
counts
love
this
beer
reminds
me
of
germany
you
could
sit
in
a
bier
garden
and
trink
bier
after
bier
after
bier
of
this
clean
crisp
light
refreshing
beer
taste
very
faint
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
alcohol
and
crackers
this
is
exceptionally
drinkable
it
is
very
soft
o
a
lager
done
in
the
proper
fashion
but
its
still
not
something
id
like
to
revisit
and
surely
not
a
flavor
i
crave
i
suppose
in
certain
situations
hot
weather
beach
sporting
event
i
would
enjoy
its
immense
drinkability
but
im
really
just
ticking
this
to
cover
the
dortmunderexport
lager
style
and
move
on
c
pours
a
mediumlight
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
the
head
settles
down
and
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
clean
and
crisp
with
notes
of
light
bread
and
noble
hops
the
taste
is
equally
crisp
with
both
qualities
of
the
aroma
balancing
each
other
quite
well
the
body
is
both
light
and
full
with
a
little
carbonation
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
an
excellent
lager
this
beer
was
recommended
by
a
customer
at
a
large
store
in
boulder
colorado
he
had
8
of
them
in
his
basket
so
i
suspected
something
was
up
and
ask
him
his
reply
was
that
he
felt
it
was
one
of
the
best
czech
pilsners
in
the
world
thats
the
kind
of
tip
you
go
with
and
i
did
nice

overall
a

great
beer
i
so
regret
never
having
purchased
the
countless
times
it
was
within
my
reach
highly
recommended
overall
another
great
beer
from
ayinger
and
one
i
would
highly
recommend
to
lager
lovers
everywhere
this
is
a
magnificent
beer
to
emphasize
how
flavorful
lagers
can
be
the
bready
bitterness
makes
this
a
fantastic
beer
would
highly
recommend
o
a
solid
beer
not
as
good
as
others
from
this
great
brewery
but
still
enjoyable
o
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
it
has
a
good
hop
character
which
keeps
the
beer
interesting
while
being
light
enough
to
make
it
an
easy
drinker
i
didnt
get
any
grain
flavor
which
is
the
biggest
disappointment
it
could
be
a
freshness
issue
but
there
is
no
bottled
date
or
import
date
listed
on
the
label
there
was
also
a
slight
harshness
to
the
beer
even
still
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
one
of
the
great
german
lagers
here
light
and
fizzy
and
sessionable
forever
pale
yellow
in
color
with
as
much
frantic
carbonation
as
a
well
shaken
soda
inch
of
white
head
rests
on
top
nose
is
like
cheerios
cereal
grains
although
light
dominant
bittering
hops
only
but
they
add
a
layer
timeless
familiar
german
lager
yeast
this
is
a
beer
that
while
new
to
me
is
comfortable
and
familiar
this
is
what
i
want
when
i
seek
a
german
lager
ultra
refreshing
light
but
not
wanting
for
flavor
at
all
no
stale
malt
flavors
and
a
clean
finish
that
isnt
too
dry
its
just
right
perfect
for
the
coming
warmer
weather
and
somehow
incredibly
cheap
to
buy
in
colorado
at
the
moment
extremely
high
carbonation
level
would
be
distracting
in
another
beer
but
it
works
wonders
for
this
already
airy
lager
german
lager
exemplified
here
for
me
i
am
going
to
load
up
on
this
later
in
the
week
i
think
very
impressed
with
a
style
here
that
doesnt
always
do
it
for
me
great
dortmunder
that
happens
to
be
my
favorite
brew
so
i
might
be
a
little
biased
the
biggest
surprise
is
the
first
sip
its
very
unique
like
the
foam
that
stays
and
lingers
inviting
your
lips
to
kiss
it
again
and
again
has
to
be
chilled
well
may
be
a
little
too
sweet
but
great
for
relatively
inexpensive
beer
finishes
dry
and
crisp
quite
bitter
with
some
flinty
minerals
very
apparent
you
know
this
is
an
authentic
dortmunder
from
this
mineral
effect
that
provide
some
bite
and
a
dry
mouthfeel
whoa
certainly
this
feature
differentiates
this
brew
from
the
other
german
and
czech
lagers
ive
tried
to
date
including
massproduced
examples
of
the
style
like
dab
as
do
the
faintly
nutty
malts
closest
thing
ive
found
to
a
legit
dortmunder
in
canada
outside
of
homebrew
circles
not
a
fan
of
the
lager
style
but
this
one
is
very
good
1000x
better
than
any
bmc
very
drinkable
overall
this
lager
was
delicious
very
traditional
clean
and
good
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
so
drinkable
easy
to
kill
a
few
bottles
of
this
mouthfeel
is
great
crisp
light
and
refreshing
feel
balances
the
sweet
and
sticky
malt
components
nicely
o
tasty
lager
is
tasty
okay
maybe
it
could
be
a
bit
hoppier
now
that
im
done
nitpicking
id
just
like
to
say
even
though
it
isnt
megacheap
3500ml
isnt
bad
though
id
gladly
buy
it

herbal

soapy
floral
included
overall
a
clean
simple
and
very
nicely
crafted
lager
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
at
the
brewery
someday
overall
i
liked
this
beer
the
more
i
drank
it
malty
and
light
overall
this
has
some
great
flavors
not
typically
found
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
the
malts
and
yeast
blend
together
very
nicely
and
make
for
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
o
must
try
i
love
surprises
like
this
great
food
and
fish
beer
pours
out
a
clear
bright
pale
gold
smells
of
hay
grain
and
bread
flavor
is
of
crackery
malts
and
crisp
grains
so
very
dry
and
crisp
fresh
herbal
minty
hops
are
very
faint
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
this
is
delicious
and
refreshing
this
truly
is
craft
at
its
finest
taste
is
also
bready
and
malt
forward
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
lingering
noble
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
very
clean
and
flavorful
light
bodied
and
highly
drinkable
made
a
great
pairing
with
weinerschnitzel
and
spaetzle
at
laschets
simplicity
is
often
underrated
and
this
is
a
shining
example
of
how
good
a
simple
beer
can
be
overall
a
perfect
beer
that
keeps
you
wanting
more
hop
fans
will
likely
want
to
pass
on
this
one
but
i
would
drink
this
anytime
i
do
wish
it
had
a
freshness
date
though
sampled
9213
and
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
came
in
a
500ml
bottle
pours
a
light
gold
in
color
with
a
1finger
of
a
white
head
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
when
sipped
many
streaming
bubbles
were
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
but
the
carbonation
was
actually
perfect
the
aroma
is
of
grain
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
pretty
close
with
a
nice
sweet
flavor
really
coming
through
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
no
bad
aftertaste
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
quite
simple
but
its
a
good
simple
good
price
at
just
over
3
for
a
500
ml
bottle
so
i
can
definitely
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
o
a
disappointing
offering
from
a
sometimes
excellent
brewery
o
nice
bavarian
lager
with
clean
palate
mouthfeel
slightly
thin
but
smooth
and
clean
overall
would
be
a
typical
forgettable
light
lager
were
it
not
for
the
buoyant
breadiness
present
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
o
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
german
lager
the
hops
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
but
the
overall
flavor
is
nice
although
a
little
too
sweet
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
masterfully
done
it
seems
that
no
american
brewery
can
approach
the
crispness
of
the
german
brewers
when
it
comes
to
this
style
of
beer
definitely
one
to
come
back
to
my
first
try
of
a
dortmunder
lager
so
i
dont
have
much
to
base
it
on
pretty
solid
a
very
tasty
lager
that
has
hints
of
an
ipa
in
it
definitely
worth
another
buy
o
ida
guessed
this
was
about
3
or
so
5
2
huh
okay
ill
take
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
brilliant
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
smells
of
grainy
malt
like
the
mash
tun
on
brew
day
with
a
light
floral
hop
to
balance
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
honey
like
grains
and
light
earthy
spice
hops
to
counter
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
mouthfeel
nice
clean
well
made
lager
that
i
could
literally
smell
all
day
this
is
great
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
ever
had
maybe
the
best
the
taste
and
smell
are
about
identical
its
a
warm
taste
with
a
distinct
bitterness
dry
excellent
to
the
end
i
would
get
this
again
golden
straw
colored
beer
with

kinda
skunky
and
grassy
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
malt
undertone
and
some
honey
scents
as
it
warms
initial
impression
is
a
big
carbonic
bite
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
the
initial
bite
is
so
big
there
is
no
real
flavor
impression
until
the
finish
which
seems
very
balanced
with
a
bit
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
malts
sweetness
has
a
flavor
somewhere
between
caramel
and
honey
but
very
mild
the
bitterness
is
somewhat
herbal
and
has
a
minerallylike
bite
a
crisp
drinkable
lager
with
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
balanced
by
a
persistent
herbal
hop
bitterness
o
easydrinking
but
just
complex
enough
to
keep
the
mind
thinking

of

there
is

are
simple

characteristically
accurate
overall
4
00
in
spite
of
its
generic
lager
look
and
somewhat
generic
bouquet
this
beer
is
a
surprise
and
rises
well
above
it
other
teutonic
lager
kin
this
is
really
sort
of
a
long
boil
lager
normal
lager
characteristics
are
heightened
and
accentuated
in
this
brew
recommended
to
all
lager
lovers
and
beer
drinkers
in
general
o
optimal
warmweather
beer
if
a
little
pricey
for
generally
cheaper
summer
styles
still
this
exceeded
expectations
and
ill
buy
it
again
easy
drinking
will
have
again
in
summer
overall
another
tasty

beer

thats
missing
is

taste
and
maybe
some
residual
sweetness
on
the
back

the
taste
reminescent
of
apple
pie
odd
and
unexpected
anyway
a
very
easy
to
drink
lager
despite
it
sweet
qualities
and
as
usual
like
everything
else
from
ayinger
delicious
notes
really
enjoyed
this
one
better
beer
on
draft
than
in
a

great

overall
a
great
drinkable
beer
overall
plain
generic
slightly
sour
but
very
drinkable
in

love
the
ayinger
brand
but
this
is
one
of
the
plainer
versions
got
a
celebrator
waiting
for
me
in
the
frig
for
next
weekend
when
i
do
my
usual
foray
into
dopplebock
land
a
decent
lager
overall
i
liked
the
balanced
malt
and
hop
mixture
a
fine
offering
this
had
body
and
depth
of
flavours
i
really
enjoyed
it
second
half
of
the
bottle
was
taken
with
some
emmental
cheese
home
made
green
tomato
chutney
and
dry
salted
biscuits
the
beer
complimented
the
food
very
well
in
deed
this
is
a
very
clean
and
crisp
beer
with
some
nice
floral
notes
d
a
real
beauty
for
me
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
super
hop
malt
balance
for
the
style
could
drink
all
day
long
d
great
balance
and
hard
to
think
of
a
better
thirst
quencher
if
only
more
lagers
were
like
this
one

medium
carbonation
ridiculously
easy
drinking
tossed
back
a
few
of
these
with
some
pretzels
and
football
on
sunday
all
is
right
with
the
world
for
a
few
hours
o
a
clean
and
enjoyable
lager
o
this
is
far
from
a
style
i
typically
enjoy
this
does
some
things
well
as
far
exceeds
what
it
looks
like
a
lightlager
with
a
massive
pale
head
taste
slight
pilsner
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bitterness
at
first
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bready
which
i
really
like
overall
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
quaffable
german
lager
there
is
nothing
complex
but
there
are
subtle
flavors
that
keep
this
one
interesting
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
othis
is
not
the
biggest
or
most
complex
beer
that
you
will
come
across
but
for
what
it
intends
to
be
this
ayinger

nice

very
crisp

smooth
to
drink
highly
enjoyable
as
expected
from
this
brewery
o
smooth
european
lager
not
quite
as
much

taste
as
id
like
but
the
clean
flavor
makes
for
a
great
beer
on
a

was
still
a

left
in

when
it
warmed
and
the
characteristics
were
much
bolder
and
more
complex
pity
there
was
not
even
half
a
mouthfuls
worth
this
is
one
lager
ill
need
to
try
again
at
warmer

because
i
think
it
has
much
better
things
to
offer
jahrhundertbier

with
the
playfulness
of

it
smells
clean
bready
with
a
very
slight

sweetness
it
doesnt
so
much
pique
your
intellectual
interest
as
it
does
lure
you
in
with
its
backtobasics
approach
as
i
am
an
american
i
have
certain
builtin
expectations
with
beers
of
such
a
light
color
any
expectation
of
thinness
or
boredom
though
disappears
in
the
first
taste
as
the
fullbodied
character
of
the
helles
immediately
occupies
the
appropriate
senses
it
is
refreshing
drinkable
its
malty
without
being
sticky
it
is
the
epitome
of
wellbalanced
i
want

i

nonetheless
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
style
based
on
the
description
of
the
style
i
thought
i
would
like
it
but
didnt
find
this
offering
terribly
interesting
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
as
expected
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
and
one
that
i
will
enjoy
many
more
times
in
the
future
o
a
simple
beer
for
sure
not
overly
complex
but
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
very
smooth
and
clean
tasting
no
bitterness
a
touch
of
sweetness
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
it
not
every
beer
has
to
be
a
barrel
aged
13
monster
its
neutral
and
a
benchmark
for
lagers
happy
to
have
tried
it
of
course
ill
make
it
a
point
to
avoid
it
in
the
future
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
german
pale
lager
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
the
taste
feel
and
appearance
lack
any
real
flaws
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
brewed
under
the
purity
law
pretty
interesting
o
light
and
drinkable
for
a
lager
i
will
put
it
on
tap
right
now
these
arent
my
flavors
but
this
one
does
them
really
well
this
is
exceptional
for
a
l
ager
but
it
is
still
a
lager
o
great
example
of
the
style
and
well
put
together
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
not
that
ive
read
others
review
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
or
bad
bottle
so
i
might
be
getting
another
to
rereview
a
subtle
haze
lays
over
a
golden
yellow
body
the
haze
give
the
yellow
a
small
amount
of
orange
color
head
is
minimal
but
the
ring
around
the
glass
is
thick
and
stays
the
whole
way
down
nose
has
a
light
yeast
character
that
meshes
well
with
some
grassyspicy
hops
light
doughy
malt
character
is
in
equal
proportion
to
the
hops
and
yeast
flavor
has
a
malty
sweetness
upfront
but
switches
right
over
to
some
fruity
grass
and
pale
malts
finishes
with
that
fruitygrass
hop
character
playing
a
big
role
and
lingering
the
malty
dough
sweetness
carries
throughout
the
finish
even
with
a
big
dryness
at
the
end
the
balance
of
malts
and
hops
from
start
to
finish
is
extremely
satisfying
another
fantastic
beer
from
aying
who
rarely
goes
wrong
it
cant
compete
with
some
of
the
bigger
styles
but
its
probably
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
overall
very
interesting
and
very
tasty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
goodness
overall
drinkability
a
good
german
lager
and
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
another
one
its
a
beer
that
is
enjoyable
in
its
simplicity
i
feel
i
could
have
plenty
of
it
and
not
get
bored
of
it
but
its
not
a
deep
or
amazing
beer
just
good
poured
a

5
white
head
hazy
light
lemonade
colored
body
smells
of
malt
nuts
spice
and
a
little
of

esthers
taste
is
the
same
plus
it
adds
on
a
nice
long
refreshing
zing
in
the
finish
along
with
lager
crispness
certainly
a
worthy
lager
one
both
beer
afficianados
and
even
bmc
drinkers
can
enjoy
together
crisp
and
bubbly
lightbodied
mouthfeel
which
comes
across
with
a
clean
bite
overall
this
makes
for
a
tasty
lager
but
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
as
the
continental
hop
profile
was
stronger
almost
like
a
pils
than
expected
recognizing
it
for
what
it
is
though
this
is
a
damn
fine
hoppy
lager
overall
this
is
a
very
straightforward
german
lager
that
is
ideal
to
have
with
almost
any
meal
especially
one
that
is
bready
its
recipe
may
be
simple
and
not
usually
what
i
drink
but
it
provides
immediate
gratification
and
quality
that
any
beer
should
have
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
random
spots
of
lace
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
bread
with
some
grass
and
citrus
notes
there
is
also
a
honey
aroma
coming
off
this
beer
as
it
warms
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
even
with
the
honey
notes
very
refreshing
flavors
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
from
ayinger
and
my
first
of
the
style
i
would
get
this
one
again
in
the
future
for
sure
a
nice
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
d
very
clean
and
refreshing
gold
lager
from
aying
taste
is
very
well
balanced
its
light
and
crisp
with
a
nice
light
hop
bite
and
slightly
spicy
yeast
note
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
smooth
and
a
bit
sharp
very
well
done
o
another
decent
ayinger
try
one
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
good
malty
lager
overall
just
a
great
example
of
the
german
brewing
tradition
that
is
widely
overlooked
these
days
i
am
not
sure
if
i
have
had
this
before
but
i
was
craving
a
german
lager
today
and
this
was
the
first
bottle
that
caught
my
eye
poured
in
to
a
sam
adams
noble
pils
glass
it
comes
out
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
white
heading
and
a
lot
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
shooting
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
comes
in
with
lots
of
grain
husk
and
a
certain
mineral
quality
huge
malty
grain
in
the
flavor
with
bittering
hops
giving
it
a
nice
edge
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
entirely
refreshing
it
strikes
me
as
a
beer
i
could
sit
and
drink
all
day
a
true
gem
of
a
beer
here
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
definitely
a
benchmark
for
the
style
nearly
flawless
with
a
malt
profile
that
is
strong
and
grainy
without
becoming
sweet
amazing
and
what
this
style
is
all
about
well
done
just
for
fun
eat
some
münchen
malts
appreciate
the
flavor
cleanse
the
palate
and
try
this
beer
cheers
radiant
strawyellow
with
an
adequate
cap
of
white
foam
grain
and
hops
seem
to
be
neck
and
neck
with
the
former
providing
a
complex
grainy
husky
and
bready
base
for
the
latters
beautiful
blend
of
easter
grass
lemon
wildflowers
and
microherbs
while
finishing
with
a
touch
of
honey
that
softens
the
essence
of
an
early
spring
meadow
trapped
into
a
beer
gorgeous
and
by
far
the
most
excellent
example
of
the
style
ive
come
upon
clear
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
full
stable
dirty
white
head
smells
malty
with
subtle
clove
grain
and
a
pinch
of
lemon
tastes
malty
and
lemony
with
a
backslpash
of
orange
and
a
light
hop
finish
clean
and
light
bodied
wellbalanced
and
smooth
this
is
simply
a
sharp
dressed
lager
notes
overall
its
a
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
with
excellent
balance
500
ml
from
wf
arlington
slainte
the
taste
falls
along
similar
linestheres
some
bread
and
grain
up
front
followed
by
a
smooth
bitterness
the
bitterness
comes
toward
the
finish
and
doesnt
rally
come
along
with
much
hop
flavor
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
drinks
quite
well
this
would
be
a
great
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
an
awesomely
flavorful
lager
i
wish
this
came
in
6packs
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
m
this
is
a
great
lager
that
i
will
be
drinking
again
this
is
a
great
brew
in
the
dead
of
winter
i
cant
imagine
how
smooth
this
would
be
under
a
summer
sun
drinkability
a
tasty
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
fits
this
style
very
well
d
an
exceptionally
drinkable
lager
with
considerable
flavor
to
boot
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
that
believe
lagers
to
be
flavorless
flavor
is
also
bready
but
with
a
less
characterful
and
fresh
impact
than
the
nose
big
and
flavorful
malt
character
with
strong
biscuity
malt
clean
and
full
finish
with
a
low
enough
impact
to
be
incredibly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
but
with
a
full
midpalate
for
a
pale
colored
low
abv
euro
lager
this
is
impressively
deep
and
flavorful
either
way
its
a
pretty
drinkable
and
basic
german
lager
due
to
their
purity
laws
that
restricts
ingredients
they
can
use
a
lot
of
these
beers
end
up
tasting
somewhat
alike
drinkability
doesnt
get
much
better
though
i
know
some
people
wont
like
how
light
the
flavors
are
though
first
im
quite
confused
how
only
a
5
5
abv
beer
has
the
alcohol
burn
of
beers
9
second
im
a
huge
fan
of
ayingers
celebrator
and
a
few
others
ive
sample
but
this
jahrhundert
seems
to
miss
the
boat
entirely
and
should
be
discontinued
the
only
positive
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
the
head
retention
continued
for
the
full
12
oz
session
in
my
pint
glass
the
starting
head
was
only
1
finger
thick
but
held
but
you
drink
a
beer
not
stare
at
it
like
a
piece
of
art
although
i
think
all
of
us
beer
geeks
prefer
looking
at
a
fine
beer
in
glass
over
most
artwork
verdict
stay
away
from
this
one
overall
ayinger
jahrhundert
bier
is
very
sessionable
although
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
odd
in
flavor
this
would
seem
to
be
a
great
transition
beer
for
a
person
just
starting
a
better
beer
journey
or
anyone
who
has
not
had
a
dortmunder
before
500
ml
bottle
pours
straw
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
is
of
light
floral
hops
hay
and
some
bready
malt
fuller
body
than
a
look
might
suggest
quite
smooth
taste
is
sweet
bready
malt
in
the
beginning
then
light
herbal
floral
hops
kick
in
overpowering
the
palate
long
dry
finish
this
ayinger
i
can
skip
next
time
verdict
really
poor
effort
and
not
worth
trying
d
4
this
beer
was
a
clear
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
it
had
a
slight
citrus
scent
the
taste
was
very
crisp
clean
and
highly
drinkable
it
is
smooth
to
drink
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
drinkable
as
said
above
strong
malty
body
worthy
of
export
another
light
clear
barely
yellow
beer
the
head
is
just
a
thin
white
sheet
over
the
top
the
nose
is
crisp
tart
pilsnerlike
and
extremely
light
it
taste
a
little
sour
with
some
skunkieness
not
my
style
beer
and
a
little
unpleasant
not
much
of
a
finish
and
what
is
there
is
not
that
desirable
just
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
experience
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
give
it
another
try
at
a
later
date
di
just
saw
this
on
the
shelves
and
figured
it
would
be
fresh
and
it
was
tasty
tasty
lager
drinkability
a
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
complex
but
very
good
overall
i
would
drink
again
drink
in
the
words
of
chip
diller
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
german
pilsner
but
maybe
thats
due
to
my
lack
of
experience
in
the
styles
id
like
to
try
another
one
in
the
future
dit
needs
to
come
in
the
16oz
bottle
because
nothing
less
would
be
satisfying
it
goes
down
so
easily
and
satisfying
pours
a
transparent
golden
yellow
color
with
a
tall
white
head
the
head
is
tall
enough
that
it
gets
in
your
nose
a
little
when
you
take
the
first
sip
thats
a
good
sign
for
a
great
beer
smells
refreshingly
hoppy
i
can
smell
some
citrus
and
yeast
in
there
too
the
taste
is
similar
light
fresh
hops
a
little
grain
taste
is
definitely
one
of
the
strongest
suites
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
overall
its
a
great
lager
something
i
would
consider
drinking
again
really
good
german
lager
here
and
a
cheap
one
at
that
i
think
this
just
found
a
regular
spot
in
my
beer
fridge
d
as
a
beginner
to
the
style
id
say
this
balances
somewhere
between
a
hefeweizen
and
saison
fantastic
beer
d
a
refreshing
beer
from
ayinger
solid
dortmunder
a
decent
lager
it
has
good
balance
and
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
very
straightforward
but
not
exactly
something
i
expect
a
brewer
to
make
for
a
centenary
celebration
though
i
was
hoping
for
something
bolder
and
more
complex
jahrhundertbier
is
a
good
brew
almost
no
hop
bitterness
but
hop
flavor
is
clear
and
present
very
high
a
light
bodied
brew
with
very
good
flavor
would
love
to
have
this
in
a
big
german
krug
true
to
style
but
i
think
i
enjoyed
their
other
brews
i
have
tried
more
good
summergrass
cutting
beverage
d
very
classic
bavarian
beer
flavours
with
a
nice
feature
of
maltiness
the
dry
crispy
finish
leaves
me
craving
more
a
very
chugable
brew
looks
like
a
macro
but
has
much
more
flavor
for
such
a
pale
lightbodied
beer
leave
it
to
hundreds
of
years
of
german
brewing
to
get
it
right
i
was
blown
away
with
the
quality
of
this
brew
when
asked
about
it
i
normally
respond
with
something
along
the
lines
of
this
is
what
grolsch
heineken
want
to
be
when
they
grow
up
while
the
styles
are
different
i
think
this
an
easy
step
for
those
interested
in
growing
from
those
examples
cheers
ayinger
jahrhundert
bier
was
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
bready
malt
with
some
light
citrus
the
taste
was
very
good
and
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
malts
and
hop
bitterness
it
had
a
nice
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
very
smooth
and
nice
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
fairly
drinkable
although
a
little
more
robust
and
heavier
than
a
regular
lager
a
hearty
pour
brings
2
of
bubbly
eggshell
head
from
this
clear
yellow
brew
nose
is
semisweet
a
little
lemon
and
skunk
similar
to
a
decent
pilsner
taste
is
much
the
same
on
the
tongue
its
a
little
fizzy
until
it
warms
up
a
bit
also
as
it
warms
a
bit
of
metallic
aftertaste
develops
mediocre
overall
one
of
the
best
munich
helles
i
have
had
and
true
to
style
in
every
way
d
light
and
crisp
flavor
is
almost
so
light
theres
nothing
there
this
is
listed
as
a
dortmunder
but
the
label
says
helles
and
the
character
more
closely
resembles
a
helles
so
thats
what
i
assumed
it
to
be
a
decent
brew
overall
d
unashamed
and
upon
ayingers
nutsack
i
plege
my
allegiance
to
this
brewery
if
i
ever
find
myself
myself
in
germany
i
would
probably
fall
to
my
knees
drinkability
is
beyond
compare
and
i
glorify
this
brew
as
such
hands
down
my
favorite
brewery
and
another
stellar
offering
to
hit
on
par
with
oktoberfest
weiss
and
dunkel
many
thanks

with
plenty

fairly

quite

this
beer
has
lots

stays
refreshing
pours
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
soft
pillowy
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
exactly
like
a
munich
helles
lager
which
its
stated
as
that
on
the
label
but
here
its
an
export
lager
whatever
really
reminds
me
of
augustiner
helles
from
when
i
was
in
germany
has
the
bright
fresh
acidity
with
german
malt
characteristic
that
jumps
at
you
tastes
really
clean
crisp
and
focused
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
in
mass
quantaties
for
sure
next
time
i
will
pour
2
into
my
masskrug
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
drinkability
is
high
as
well
and
this
really
should
be
the
go
to
sessionsummer
brew
d
this
is
a
great
german
lager
great
flavor
and
highly
drinkable
the
bavarians
really
know
how
to
make
great
beer
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
d
very
easy
as
are
most
german
lagers
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
for
both
a
meal
and
an
evening
spent
with
friends
i
definitely
found
one
sip
followed
another
quite
easily
and
im
sure
ill
be
having
this
one
again
usually
i
go
for
hops
but
i
love
this
malt
monster
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
nice
whitish
head
taste
is
smooth
mellow
bready
rich
thick
malt
our
local
indian
restaurant
serves
this
and
indeed
it
tastes
like
a
malty
indian
brew
i
think
its
kingfisher
but
much
better
drank
this
one
at
a
vietnamese
restaurant
on
san
francisco
bay
and
it
turns
out
an
indian
fellow
from
mumbai
was
sitting
next
to
me
drinking
the
same
beer
he
liked
it
a
lot
too
this
is
like
a
really
good
version
of
heineken
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
could
use
a
richer
malt
character
but
well
balanced
a
very
good
lager
rated
to
style
ayinger
rarely
disappoints
clean
crisp
medium
body
with
a
nice
balance
of
pilsner
malt
citrus
and
earthy
hops
crisp
light
fruit
and
grassstraw
notes
sweet
with
hints
of
apple
and
pear
along
with
subtle
citrus
notes
as
well
as
some
banana
and
a
tangy
dry
finish
well
balanced
and
pretty
drinkable
juicy
refreshing
mouthfeel
again
much
more
substantial
than
it
looks
delicious
medium
bodied
smooth
and
tingly
a
good
substantial
feel
and
a
nice
drinkable
export
lager
nice
golden
color
slightly
cloudy
with
lacing
throughout
smells
like
honey
lemons
taste
smooth
with
hints
of
honey
citrus
grass
some
carbonation
but
a
nice
match
with
flavorings
with
an
overall
result
of
a
very
drinkable
beer
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
would
be
excellent
with
fish
cheese
or
fruit
bottle
home
very
good
malty
german
lager
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
good
white
head
the
aroma
has
lots
of
doughy
malt
and
a
good
dose
of
floral
and
grassy
noble
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
lager
heaven
the
malt
tastes
like
sweet
yeasty
bread
and
the
hops
are
crisp
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
tastes
wonderfully
fresh
you
can
almost
imagine
green
hop
cones
and
fresh
barley
as
you
drink
it
i
would
love
to
see
more
american
breweries
attempt
lagers
like
this
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
quite
refreshing
delighitful
lager
definitely
worth
a
buy
even
better
post
mowing
the
lawn
or
washing
the
car
in
the
warm
sun
this
brewery
makes
some
good
stuff
i
havent
had
a
beer
from
them
i
didnt
like
yet
f
semi
dry
with
lingering
wheat
and
toasty
malts
a
nice
lingering
good
lager
flavor
crisp
and
clean
finish
a
light

lingering
as
well
another
amazing
bavarian
lager
from
ayinger
i
really
need
to
take
a
trip
out
to
bavaria
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
drinkable
lager
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
now
i
really
want
to
try
other
examples
of
the
style
as
usual
ayinger
has
done
a
solid
job
at
crafting
a
solid
example
of
the
style
theyre
going
for
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
light
lagers
but
if
youre
going
to
tie
me
up
and
force
one
down
my
throat
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
if
it
were
this
one
jahrhundert
goes
down
the
ol
hatch
like
coke
up
lindsay
lohans
nose
by
the
second
commercial
break
of
the
24
episode
i
was
watching
it
was
history
d
a
wonderful
export
lager
crisp
and
refreshing
with
all
the
elements
in
good
balance
d
paired
well
with
some
leftover
thai
red
curry
chicken
not
a
huge
fan
of
german
lagers
but
this
was
among
the
better
ones
i
have
tried
give
it
a
try
yourself
beer
is
medium
to
low
bodied
sweet
up
front
and
finishes
cleanly
there
is
a
slight
sulfur
flavor
in
the
back
but
overall
its
clean
and
crisp
there
is
a
slight
ester
quality
to
it
almost
berry
flavor
drinkability
is
high
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
improvement
but
in
entirety
the
beer
is
very
good
drinkability
this
is
a
great
session
beer
nicely
refreshing
and
easy
to
quaff
overall
clean
and
crisp
nice
drinker
d
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
this
beer
is
now
a
goto
for
me
drinkability
is
great
light
body
low
abv
just
wish
i
had
some
mexican
food
to
pair
with
this
overall
a
quinessential
perfect
example
of
the
style
there
is
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
but
yet
it
never
bombards
or
overpowers
the
palate
please
take
heed
of
the
quality
class
and
care
of
this
fine
offering
train
your
palate
to
it
fully
enjoy
this
masterpiece
drinkability
is
good
i
dont
like
very
bland
beers
this
is
interesting
enough
to
make
me
want
to
pound
a
few
especially
on
a
warm
day
d
easy
to
drink
and
something
i
could
see
myself
going
for
a
second
and
third
sessionable
also
great
summer
beer
for
bbq
or
picnics
i
really
liked
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
skunky
almost
pilsener
like
taste
is
crisp
some
malts
and
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
mediocre
offering
taste
is
full
maltiness
up
front
with
bread
light
fruit
golden
raisin
pear
hint
of
honey
and
zesty
herbs
a
nice
maltygrainherbal
finish
and
a
full
grainbread
dough
character
with
light
herbal
bitterness
following
at
the
aftertaste
it
is
slightly
oily
and
a
bit
on
the
sweet
sidebut
the
flavours
are
excellent
clean
fresh
well
integrated
and
balanced
thanks
bobsy
this
is
an
eminently
sessionable
dortmunder
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
could
imagine
putting
quite
a
few
of
these
back
on
a
nice
summers
day
hazy
deep
straw
yellow
colour
big
bright
white
head
the
bubbles
in
the
beer
keep
the
head
stacked
at
a
minimum
but
that
minimum
is
kept
for
a
long
time
the
nose
is
grainy
and
thats
about
it
maybe
a
bit
of
a
metallic
note
the
general
taste
is
a
grainy
malt
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
body
is
a
bit
thick
even
without
the
addition
of
the
carbonation
but
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
at
a
cold
temp
i
have
a
hard
time
thinking
of
a
good
american
example
of
the
style
very
hard
water
would
help
d
its
decent
enough
but
this
just
wasnt
for
me
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
euro
pilsner
which
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
from
the
330
ml
bottle
with
no
noticeable
lot
code
or
expiration
date
sampled
on
september
26
2009
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
longlasting
white
head
a
very
malty
aroma
as
it
should
be
a
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
sort
of
honeylike
in
texture
malts
are
the
leading
flavor
sensation
by
far
along
with
something
bready
a
nice
traditional
bavarian
malt
brew
a
pretty
good
export
recommended
overall
i
have
to
say
that
im
not
terribly
experienced
with
this
style
but
i
was
a
fan
of
what
i
tasted
crisp
flavors
and
nothing
was
out
of
place
worth
a
shot
pours
a
palemedium
golden
with
a
full
head
that
dissipates
into
a
white
ring
with
moderate
lacing
herbal
smells
with
haystraw
dominating
taste
is
rather
subdued
again
with
herbalstraw
notes
and
a
restrained
hoppiness
in
the
background
some
tart
citrus
notes
detectable
in
the
aftertaste
not
at
all
unpleasant
though
very
good
smooth
mouthfeel
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
find
this
to
be
a
good
representation
of
what
the
style
should
be
imho
highly
drinkable
this
might
be
a
close
to
perfect
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
enching
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
keeper
for
those
of
you
who
like
dry
grassy
clean
beers
youve
gotta
try
this
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
and
a
bubbly
2
5
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
smell
is
some
bready
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
up
front
with
some
spice
and
malt
some
honey
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
back
for
a
somewhat
dry
finish
some
lemon
and
citrus
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
some
effervescence
very
nice
very
drinkable
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
lagers
but
id
drink
this
one
again
d
not
bad
decent
session
beer
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
and
mediumlow
carbonation
somewhat
sweet
with
little
in
the
way
of
hops
to
balance
it
out
very
drinkable
and
especially
nice
on
a
hot
day
d
my
first
for
this
style
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
definitely
could
be
a
easy
session
brew
sessioning
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
maybe
too
much
so
at
5
5
and
in
500ml
bottles
sucking
these
back
is
gonna
catch
up
to
you
poured
a
clear
straw
gold
with
good
head
retention
thanks
to
constant
carbonation
a
grainy
herbal
hop
smell
that
is
a
little
husky
incredibly
smooth
and
has
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
to
it
like
honey
or
light
chocolate
and
hints
of
cherriesberries
for
a
very
minor
fruit
taste
not
just
a
dry
citrusyveggie
taste
balanced
and
has
a
dry
edge
but
is
very
well
balanced
thanks
to
the
sweet
malt
sensations
i
could
session
this
anytime
d
a
little
bit
too
sweet
overall
the
predominant
flavor
charactaristics
of
this
brew
are
honey
and
biscuits
i
love
dortmunders
and
would
definitely
buy
this
again
but
i
like
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
better
pale
goldenstraw
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
film
light
lacing
smell
is
mild
and
malty
with
some
grain
and
light
lemon
the
taste
has
a
huge
malty
sweetness
its
fine
its
just
that
i
wasnt
expecting
it
also
a
pleasant
mild
floral
hops
presence
the
finish
is
nicely
bitter
and
dry
with
some
lingering
grassy
hops
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
more
as
it
went
down
worth
trying
d
was
down
the
glass
before
i
knew
it
and
it
tastes
great
too
definitely
deserving
of
a
5
here
so
drinkable
i
barely
noticed
it
was
so
easy
to
drink
until
i
was
wondering
where
the
hell
all
the
beer
in
my
glass
went
this
is
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
ive
ever
tried
500ml
bottle
pours
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
a
large
sturdy
white
head
that
lasts
nice
sweet
grainy
smell
with
very
light
grassy
hops
tastes
again
of
grains
notes
of
sweet
hay
faint
hop
bitterness
lightish
body
a
pretty
straightforward
lager
without
any
real
character
d
flavorful
and
light
this
one
is
quite
the
easy
drinker
its
got
enough
flavor
to
go
with
food
or
on
its
own
i
may
prefer
something
just
a
tad
bit
hoppier
to
session
with
but
this
beer
would
do
just
fine
d
this
light
smooth
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
but
the
aroma
is
a
little
strange
there
is
good
depth
to
the
flavor
and
the
sulfur
qualities
are
reserved
letting
the
malt
and
hops
come
through
a
world
apart
from
north
american
lagers
close
your
eyes
and
imagine
yourself
in
munich
or
aying
this
has
genuinely
pleasant
german
lager
the
obviously
good
kind
written
all
over
it
inside
and
out
it
seems
a
shame
to
not
be
drinking
it
whilst
parking
my
backpacking
backside
on
some
centuriesold
spartan
wood
bench
table
d
very
tasty
very
easy
to
drink
i
imagine
you
could
throw
down
quite
a
few
of
these
in
place
of
your
everyday
lager
d
i
love
this
beer
i
could
drink
several
i
didnt
know
of
it
until
finding
it
in
the
local
wegmans
very
very
easy
drinking
they
only
sold
the
half
liter
bottles
as
singles
d
very
good
drinkability
i
was
afraid
that
this
bottle
may
have
been
past
prime
based
on
where
it
was
purchased
but
its
damn
good
i
was
going
to
save
my
reviews
of
my
favorite
biers
from
deutschland
until
oktoberfest
2009
season
but
what
the
hell
dortmund
not
dortmunder
is
a
suburblike
area
of
muenster
in
the
northwest
where
i
plan
on
visiting
next
year
and
i
could
see
the
factory
workers
dropping
by
the
local
and
sitting
outdoors
for
a
few
pints
of
this
before
heading
home
for
their
wives
homecooked
german
meals
pour
is
golden
with
a
mild
greenish
tone
two
fingers
of
white
head
nice
delicate
lace
nose
is
malt
of
toffee
and
apple
and
a
nice
twig
quality
palate
is
not
so
earth
but
citrus
with
a
nice
toffee
apple
finish
consistent
and
steady
feel
that
has
a
nice
sweet
fruit
a
blend
of
apple
like
and
citrus
yet
subtle
d
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
perfectly
carbonated
perfect
abv
d
pretty
good
this
beer
has
a
good
body
but
is
smooth
drinking
and
crisp
with
flavor
for
days
really
hard
to
go
wrong
poured
translucent
yellow
not
completely
see
through
but
not
as
cloudy
as
an
unfilteredhefeweizen
very
refreshing
beer
the
carbonation
seemed
as
if
there
was
more
of
it
but
with
smaller
than
usual
bubbles
if
that
makes
sense
at
it
warmed
slightly
the
aroma
really
came
out
honey
and
malt
was
what
i
was
getting
from
it
i
didnt
get
much
citrus
as
some
others
did
but
did
notice
the
slightest
acidic
hint
to
linger
for
a
lager
is
sure
drank
a
lot
like
a
czech
pilsner
just
a
great
quality
beer
d
first
of
all
this
really
should
be
listed
as
a
dortmunderexport
anyway
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
with
the
exception
of
prima
pils
bavarian
brewers
are
absolutely
untouchable
when
it
comes
to
producing
quality
pale
lagers
this
is
one
of
the
premier
examples
a
bit
maltier
than
most
but
outstanding
nonetheless
easily
one
of
the
best
munich
helles
that
i
have
had
i
only
wish
these
beers
were
cheaper
and
available
in
six
packs
nice
yellow
blond
color
pretty
beer
with
a
held
head
smells
good
sweet
kind
of
not
hoppy
but
malty
very
good
tasting
beer
again
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
really
good
mouthfeel
was
good
full
of
flavor
very
nice
beer
i
could
drink
a
couple
and
then
sit
around
for
awhile
good
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
mild
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
but
there
are
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
mouthfeel
is
soft
but
sparkling
carbonation
nice
beer
the
kind
id
gladly
sit
and
drink
all
night
long
if
given
the
opportunity
sidenote
wonderful
label
as
well
im
a
graphic
designer
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
bottle
ill
be
saving
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
still
retains
an
overall
viscosity
thats
about
right
drinkability
is
decent
overall
a
pretty
good
lager
from
germany
drinkability
tastes
good
mild
generally
low
abv
good
mouthfeel
recommended
overall
quite
nice
highly
recommended
a
masterful
balance
of
malt
and
hop
character
a
nice
light
refreshing
brew
that
knows
no
boundaries
as
far
as
the
time
of
year
is
concerned
this
is
a
beer
that
budweiser
etc
wishes
they
could
brew
i
could
see
sitting
back
and
knocking
down
a
number
of
these
its
very
easy
to
drink
clean
tasting
and
goes
well
with
just
about
anything
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
you
could
enjoy
throughout
the
night
thin
mouthfeel
and
nice
carbonation
finishes
very
dry
and
slightly
bitter
that
being
said
the
honey
sweet
malts
and
mild
but
spicy
hops
make
this
one
of
the
most
delicious
and
balanced
lagers
i
have
tasted
call
it
what
you
like
i
could
drink
these
all
day
the
taste
wow
this
is
probably
one
of
the
smoothest
lagers
youll
find
there
is
a
nice
graininess
to
the
beer
some
florals
popping
through
and
just
a
honey
smoothness
that
makes
this
a
delight
it
is
very
refreshing
there
are
some
cracker
like
biscuitiness
in
the
background
and
some
smooth
malts
that
do
tend
towards
the
dryness
in
the
finish
there
is
just
a
bit
of
hop
presence
that
balances
out
the
honey
flavors
so
that
the
beer
doesnt
become
overly
sweet
or
cloying
the
hop
adds
a
nice
complementary
balance
in
this
beer
there
isnt
much
crispness
and
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
germans
still
make
the
best
lagers
around
and
this
is
no
exception
lchaim
the
taste
is
very
grainy
upfront
as
the
malt
hits
your
palate
this
is
where
the
grains
i
detected
in
the
nose
hit
my
mouth
you
also
taste
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
balances
out
this
mediumbodied
brew
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
end
with
a
mild
hop
bite
but
the
brew
finishes
very
clean
the
yellow
color
light
enough
that
not
only
is
it
transparent
you
can
se
the
widespread
large
bubbles
work
their
way
upwards
thick
head
of
immaculate

the
foam
so
fine
you
almost
cant
see
the
bubbles

them
crisp
welldetailed

of
mellow

with
more
of
a
suggestion
of
honey
than

bread
the
malts
smooth
out
the
texture
without
ever
dominating
light
to
mediumbodied
with
persistent
carbonation
which
adds
to
the
body
rather
than

an
impression

apricot

pear

the
foam
slightly
lower
you
could
chug
a
gallon
before
having
to
whiz
this
brew
has
a
very
distinctive
flavor
and
nose
also
a
great
feel
nothing
overbearing
but
a
nice
complex
combination
of
aromas
and
flavors

aftertaste
is
bitter
citrus
i
know
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
there
is
just
something
about
the
taste
that
could
be
better
taste
is
good
pretty
bready
and
mildly
bitter
somewhat
fruity
and
sweet
but
overall
very
grainybready
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
and
there
is
some
metallic
coming
through
in
the
taste
not
bad
at
all
but
the
augustiner
munich
helles
lager
is
far
better
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
why
i
love
german
beers
and
that
reason
is
balance
and
that
balance
is
of
subtle
flavors
which
is
even
harder
to
perfect
the
appearance
was
of
a
filtered
pilsner
with
a
hint
more
of
orange
a
hint
to
more
malt
and
a
big
frothy
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
the
smell
was
classic
german
festbier
helles
pilsner
taste
was
a
nice
surprise
being
a
special
beer
the
flavor
had
to
be
something
different
well
not
too
different
to
mess
with
a
winning
german
beer
formula
to
me
it
taste
as
though
they
added
more
of
each
ingredient
to
bring
more
flavor
all
around
and
especially
more
sweetness
from
the
extra
malt
that
gave
the
hint
of
orange
color
and
a
tad
more
alcohol
but
by
increasing
all
the
ingredients
some
what
equally
the
refreshing
balance
is
maintained
mouth
feel
is
watery
smooth
and
hint
of
slickness
drinkability
is
good
do
to
the
exceptional
balance
wow
this
one
blew
away
my
expectations
to
the
next
county
to
its
credit
ayinger
jahrhundert
becomes
my
favorite
lager
to
date
as
well
as
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
fortunately
for
me
its
easily
accessable
and
wont
cost
me
more
than
3
a
halfliter
drink
and
learn
fellow
bas
this
is
what
a
german
helles
lager
is
all
about
d
this
is
a
good
lager
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
surpising
spicy
kick
hugely
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
ayinger
d
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
really
keeps
the
drinkability
down
the
flavor
is
good
but
its
not
something
i
want
to
keep
drinking
with
the
relatively
heavy
and
flat
mouthfeel
it
has
almost
a
marzen
flavor
but
with
a
hefeweizens
complexity
yet
another
winner
from
ayinger
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
rocky
head
that
left
behind
some
very
nice
looking
lacing
grainy
aroma
with
only
slightest
hint
of
hoppiness
sweet
malty
flavor
a
little
grainy
husky
minimal
hop
bitterness
creamy
on
the
tongue
decent
carbonation
a
fantastic
helles
lager
probably
the
best
ive
had
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
aforementioned
this
one
is
much
heavier
on
the
palate
than
i
expected
im
going
to
say
that
this
one
is
heavy
on
the
palate
not
heavy
as
a
stout
mind
you
but
for
the
style
i
think
that
it
is
heavy
low
carbonation
and
what
ill
gather
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
residual
sugar
or
maybe
its
just
full
of
unfermentable
dextrins
no
matter
what
it
is
this
beer
has
a
full
body
finish
isnt
dry
as
was
with
the
edestoff
very
pleasant
beer
one
that
ill
definitely
be
buying
again
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
great
helles
however
still
going
to
be
questing
for
better
and
different
helles
most
likely
wont
be
back
to
it
for
a
while
till
i
run
out
of
available
helles
in
the
area
definitely
worth
the
time
and
money
to
try
mfd
overall
a
very
good
beer
went
great
with
a
soft
pretzel
and
spicy
mustard
d
nice
easy
fullfloavored
helles
very
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
poured
a
dark
yellow
color
with
extremely
fluffly
white
head
that
took
quite
some
time
to
dissipate
aroma
was
a
malty
grainness
taste
was
extremely
malty
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
tasted
of
malt
grain
and
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
excellent
and
drinkability
is
way
up
there
i
enjoyed
drinkability
acceptable
but
its
no
altbairisch
dunkel
i
will
say
it
has
a
very
clear
pale
straw
yellow
body
with
a
large
1
5
head
that
had
great
retention
and
lasted
to
the
last
sipp
and
left
some
extensive
patches
of
film
smells
of
biscuity
malt
and
light
grassy
noble
hops
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
buscuit
malt
with
some
grainy
flavors
and
a
good
back
end
bitter
hop
hit
that
gives
a
clean
dry
entrance
to
the
finish
before
giving
way
to
the
malt
again
on
the
swallow
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
more
oh
wait
about
3
more
ozs
in
the
bottle
nice
d
a
good
beer
from
ayinger
not
a
typical
helles
but
solid
nonetheless
a
very
well
balanced
brew
that
is
more
complicated
than
it
seems
a
another
great
brew
from
ayinger
notes
finally
i
find
a
helles
lager
that
i
enjoy
both
the
fff
gorch
fock
and
brooklyn
keller
helles
were
disappointments
overall
a
decent
enough
and
pretty
drinkable
lager
nothing
groundbreaking
but
very
quaffable
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
very
satisfying
beer
indeed
d
decent
light
drinking
helles
lager
not
particularly
my
style
but
cleanly
brewed
and
decent
for
what
it
is
drinkability
an
excellent
session
beer
very
crisp
and
drinkable
i
love
the
celebrator
doppelbock
so
i
went
for
the
opposite
en
of
the
spectrum
poured
a
pale
yellow
but
colorful
at
the
same
time
not
just
drab
like
many
thin
watery
beers
smelled
pleasenty
of
lemons
and
a
bit
grassy
reminiscent
of
a
shandy
maybe
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
with
the
same
hint
of
lemon
zest
but
smooth
on
the
tongue
it
was
wunderbar
d
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
help
this
beer
but
i
will
not
drink
again
d
ive
never
had
a
lager
with
such
a
prominent
coriander
aroma
and
flavour
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
very
much
its
very
light
and
a
breeze
to
drink
i
will
most
definitely
buy
this
helles
again
this
could
be
a
new
summer
favourite
for
me
im
loving
this
brewery
a
perfect
fit
for
my
100th
review
cheers
very
different
from
their
doppelbock
this
poured
a
very
pale
blonde
with
fluffy
white
head
it
had
a
very
light
and
springy
scent
like
lemon
and
yeast
it
tasted
like
sour
hops
at
first
fairly
typical
for
lagers
i
believe
with
some
honey
sweetness
for
balance
it
was
light
and
watery
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mild
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
light
beer
not
bad
for
a
lager
but
not
good
for
me
bravo
to
zee
hermans
ja
ja
ja
ja
wow
the
pale
colour
and
standard
euro
hoppy
nose
indicate
a
standard
euro
pils
but
the
beer
is
full
of
big
bodied
goodness
the
crispness
and
big
finish
make
this
beer
a
cut
above
most
pils
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
beer
combined
with
a
decent
hop
rate
that
make
every
sip
a
joy
quenching
but
not
too
crisp
or
dry
giving
it
a
somewhat
unique
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
very
good
super
smooth
low
alcohol
mellow
flavors
the
kind
of
beer
you
can
drink
forever
the
best
element
of
this
gem
to
me
is
its
outstanding
texture
it
holds
this
together
extremely
well
and
makes
it
amazingly
easy
to
down
ayinger
is
an
incredible
brewery
and
everything
ive
had
from
ayinger
including
jahrhundert
is
nothing
short
of
excellent
and
delicious
choosing
this
for
my
200th
review
was
almost
as
good
a
decision
as
choosing
this
from
friar
tuck
superb
well
i
was
caught
off
guard
by
this
one
but
not
at
all
surprised
due
to
its
namesake
the
balance
of
this
beer
excellent
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
make
this
one
hell
of
a
good
brew
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
privilege
of
drinking

of
the
style
d
i
cut
my
teeth
on
german
beers
helles
were
never
my
thing
but
i
must
say
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
class
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
directly
at
the

an

refreshing
and
envigorating

all
summing

a

from
a
brown
half
liter
bottle
there
is
a
nice
light
spicy

aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
would
expect
but
quite
pleasant
there
is
untoasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
spicycitrusy
hops
in
the
taste
and
thats
about
it
but
this
simple
combination
adds
up
to
quite
a
pleasant
lager
d
drinks
alright
but
due
to
the
taste
i
wont
be
buying
again
i
havent
tried

true

just
enough
co2
a
very
drinkable
beer
ill
drink
this
one
again
soon
this
would
also
be
a
great
beer
to
serve
up
to
any
bmc
drinking
friends
you
have
it
has
the
same
look
but
infinitely
better
taste
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
a
beer
with
any
new
or
overwhelming
flavors
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
holds
to
about
a
quarter
inch
but
not
a
lot

like
green
olives
cured
in

taste
is
malty
with
a
earthy
corn
grainy
finish
medium
body
and
slightly
dry
not
what
i
expected
for
a
lager
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
medium
body
and
almost
creamy
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
segue
way
into
the
fall
as
with
most
ayinger
beers
highly
recommended
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
yellow
in
color
with
good
clarity
the
head
was
good
but
dissipated
after
several
seconds
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
estery
almost
hefeweisenlike
there
was
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
estery
and
lightly
spicy
almost
alelike
d
if
youre
looking
for
the
subtle
nuances
of
a
lager
and
something
that
will
pair
well
with
food
or
be
able
to
stand
on
its
own
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
not
only
is
this
a
good
example
of
the
style
its
quite
versatile
and
has
a
relatively
low
abv
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
lagers
especially
the
german
helles
style

drinkability
pours

its
close
to
the
style
as
mentioned
as
well
finishes
with
a
sweet

taste
very
good
beer
easy
to
drink
another
good
example
of
a
munich
helles
lager
this
one
isnt
anything
to
go
crazy
over
but
its
still
above
average
amazingly
drinkable
for
a
pils
all
the
usual
smoothness
with
a
bonus
in
body
hops
are
here
seeminglly
in
tradition
only
less
refreshing
and
more
chewable
mouthfeel
was
rounded
and
smooth
with
a
short
soft
finish
d
easy
drinking
effortlessly
sessionable
why
doesnt
bud
or
miller
taste
like
this
rhetorical
question
d
most
of
the
ayinger
brand
is
a
must
and
this
bier
stands
with
its
already
exceptional
class
i
would
buy
this
again
and
i
think
i
will
as
soon
as
i
get
around
to
it
notes
a
simple
lager
not
terribly
complex
but
impressive
in
its
balance
the
taste
remains
extremely
clean
even
when
it
warms
up
i
bet
this
would
be
a
great
beer

im
not

this
one
has
a

than
average
and
i
like
that
very
nice
going

drinkable
bottle

of
plucier

some
white
hue
and
a

with
good
retention
aroma
of
floral
malt
with
some
light
citrusy
notes
taste
is
dominated
by
big
floral
malt
with
some
light
sweetness
defintely
more
malt
then
what
i
am
use
to
for
the
style
body
is
full
with
some
low
filtration
and
some
great
carbonation
overall
well
done
for
the
style
the
flavour
was
mainly
malty
and
sweet
with
a
breadlike
quality
but
some
hops
at
the
back
end
added
a
nice
crisp
bitterness
that
prevented
it
from
being
cloying
medium
carbonation
and
body
felt
right
and
kept
up
this

outstanding
refreshing
qualities
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice

that
dissipated
without
leaving
much
lace
the
smell
is
of
mellow
spice

bit
grainy

has
a
slight
buttery
smell
the
taste
is
slighty
spicy

grainybready

base
some
light

presence
but
nothing
significant
to
make
this

a

creamy
yet
well
carbonated
a
very
good
helles
some
nice
subtle
flavors
blending
well
a
nice
summer
drinking
brew
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disapointed
by
this
one
from
ayinger
as
i
normally
enjoy
their
offerings
but
as
a
helles
its
not
too
bad
im
just
not
that
big
a
fan
of
this
particular
one
this
is
a
nice
pale
lager
but
nothing
to
flip
about
it
is
so
nice
to
enjoy
another
great
beer
except
that
it
further
muddies
the
water
when
trying
to
determine
where
above
average
and
excellent
resides
this
is
a
good
crisp
pale
lager
this
is
what
to
me
is
considered
good
ballpark
beer
not
disruptive
or
offensive
in
any
area
along
with
many
other
beers
in
this
category
it
is
definitely
worth
being
on
a
long
term
beer
rotation
carbonation
levels
are
resonable
making
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
a
classic
munich
style
lager
prost
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
as
actively
carbonated
as
first
appearance
would
leave
one
to
believe
an
awesome
lighter
lager
thats
still
full
of
flavor
it
looks
a
proper
strawyellow
in
my
glass
similar
to
a
macro
lager
but
the
aroma
is
way
off
from
cheap
beer
its
sweet
with
a
pale
grains
and
lager
funk
the
flavor
expands
on
the
aroma
with
deeper
barley
flavors
and
a
balancing
bitterness
but
nothing
on
par
with
a
good
pilsner
definitely
a
good
lager
to
try
if
youve
never
had
a
good
helles
lager
pours
an
extremely
light
straw
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
clean
with
malt
a
touch
of
biscuits
and
some
herbal
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
smoot
maltiness
that
finishes
with

with
a
nice
lingering
herbal
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
from
the

overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
lager
definately
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
recommended
very
well
balanced
a
smooth
refreshing
brew
that
is
not
short
of
taste
and
complexity
another
great
beer
from
brauerei
aying
quite
simple
but
nicely
done
and
enjoyable
poured
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
rocky
head
and
nice
lacing
bread
dough
dominates
the
nose
along
with
some
floral
and
honey
notes
taste
is
balanced
towards
the
malt
with
nice
residual
sweetness
reined
in
slightly
by
some
subdued
hop
bitterness
i
definitely
enjoy
the
clean
slightly
sweet
malt
profile
of
ayinger
beers
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
on
first
impression
a
great
session
beer
but
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
after
a
couple
of
these
needs
a
touch
more
hop
bitterness
body
is
medium
but
feels
light
on
the
palate
with
a
creamy
texture
and
slick
drinkability
a
interesting
beer
and
a
style
that
will
require
furthur
investigation
pours
a
good
thick
head
that
has
pretty
good
retention
it
also
has
a
very
good
lacing
along
with
a
good
clear
very
very
light
golden
color
smell
is
bready
and
a
little
sweet
nice
smell
thats
lagerlike
but
with
a
seemingly
thicker
smell
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
first
thing
is
when
it
hits
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
you
taste
a
sweetness
of
the
malted
barley
usually
im
not
a
fan
of
sweetness
especially
when
accompanied
by
lagers
ever
since
my
first
lager
buttwiper
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
sweet
beverage
has
always
been
sickening
this
however
is
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
nice
very
good
overall
i
will
have
this
again
i
like
it
i
will
buy
3
next
time
to
fill
up
my
1
liter

haus
glass
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
lager
that
hooks
me
right
in
love
the
smoothness
the
tasty
malt
and
the
herbal
grassy
hop
qualities
i
feel
like
im
in
bavaria
pours
a
hazy
straw
hue
with
lots
of
sediment
the
three
finger
head
is
rocky
and
dense
showing
great
retention
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
fantastic
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
light
caramel
and
pale
malt
background
pale
munich
malt
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
mellow
wheat
flavor
and
a
slightly
acidic
citrus
note
somewhat
dry
aftertaste
with
a
faint
yeast
bite
anf
fading
acidity
this
makes
for
a
good
balance
when
combined
with
the
mild
spicyfloral
german
hop
flavor
light
bodied
and
medium
carbonated
but
brisk
on
the
tounge
due
to
the
wheat
texture
and
citric
character
very
refreshing
yet
it
has
a
considerable
malt
profile
an
odd
combination
that
seeems
to
work
well
here
great
drinkability
with
an
interesting
residual
pale
malt
sweetness
and
tart
phenols
in
the
finish
a
strange
helles
for
sure
but
a
good
one
in
my
book
not
sure
of
the
age
of
this
bottle
but
once
again
the
vulnerability
of
imports
to
americas
threetier
system
shows
lack
of
accountability
for
oldpoorly
handled
product
overall
a
nice
flavorful
helles
very
sessionable
and
so
full
of
complex
flavor
that
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
i
expect
much
more
from
this
brewer
an
easydrinking
session
light
smooth
and
refreshing
with
enough
malty
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
if
you
want
an
easy
malty
drink
this
is
a
good
choice
d
aside
from
slight
metallic
aftertaste
not
really
offensive
but
just
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
a
tasty
beer
that
aims
to
please
when
ever
i
think
of
german
beers
i
think
malty
robust
dark
in
color
and
frothy
heads
which
may
be
true
to
an
extent
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
smooth
drinkable
tasty
german
lager
purchased
this
at
belmont

on

at

temps
poured
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
impressive
comact
three
finger
head
and
attendent
lacing
the
cloudiness
set
off
alarm
bells
immediatly
the
aroma
was
mainly
a
grainy
sour
maltiness
the
taste
mirrored
the
aroma
sour
sweet
a
bit
rancid
the
sell
by
date
on
the
bottle
was
missing
this
beer
is
obviously
oxidized
too
bad
i
drank
ayinger
lagers
while
living
in
germany
many
moons
ago
fulll

in
the
taste
followed
by
bitter

bath
unfortunately
tinged
with
metal
in
the
aftertaste
otherw
ffrom
that
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
mouthfeel
is
wet
and
refreshing
carbonaation
is
about
right
for
the
style
not
a
beer
ill
be
looking
high
and
low
for
but
not
terrible
either
esssionable
if
you
were
so
inclined
among
ayingers
weakest
but
for
many
brewers
better
than
their
best
pretty
good
overall
not
really
my
style
but
i
liked
it
notes
i
couldnt
finish
the
beer
this
doesnt
happen
often
it
was
just
way
too
sweet
and
malty
and
i
didnt
like
the
herbal
hops
either
oelergud
not
a
bad
brew
yet
i
wont
be
searching
this
for
this
beer
at
the
store
better
imo
than
the
oktoberfest

of
these
in

while
not
as
good
as
the
doublebock
this
ayinger
is
a
nice
beer
cheers
notes
a
good
brew
that
is
refreshing
and
shows
some
depth
notes
a
very
very
good
beir
that
i
would
have
again
yet
it
is
not
the
wiehenstephaner
which
is
the
finest
example
of
the
syle

very
pleasant
sweetness
rounds
everything
out
with
this
beer
cunningly
deep
layered
flavors
and
awesomely
balanced
german
goodness
this
actually
approaches
a
dortmunder
in
style
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
a
firm
malt
body
d
this
is
a
very
nice
summertime
beer
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
without
being
too
bold
and
enough
balance
to
keep
it
very
drinkable
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
will
i
run
out
and
buy
more
probably
not
right
now
i
cant
find
any
either
but
i
will
try
to
revisit
this
one
again
definitely
a
must
try
to
experience
the
style
drinkability
this
is
decent
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
fairly
sessionable
my
bro
and
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
highly
drinkable
brew
shortly
after
landing
in
munich
gold
and
bubbly
the
smell
was
almost
nil
with
a
touch
of
bread
it
poured
with
a
nice
head
and
dispersed
quickly
my
brother
commented
that
it
had
a
bit
of
a
rubbery
aftertaste
but
i
could
not
find
it
we
both
liked
it
and
had
another
it
was
a
great
way
to
start
off
our
world
cup
trip
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
thick
white
head
that
lingered
through
much
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
bread
and
dough
the
taste
is
a
continuation
of
the
bread
and
malt
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
bitterness
impressed
with
the
long
strong
finish
overall
an
outstanding
lager
with
a
great
balance
between
hops
and
malt
and
extremely
drinkable
strongly
recommended
prost
mk
overall
a
really
fine
beer
ayinger
makes
solid
products
this
is
also
good
but
nothing
i
will
have
to
get
next
time
i
am
beer
hunting
in
ny
mouthfeeldrinkability
exactly
what
i
would
expect
for
this
beer
elegant
simple
yet
fully
present
this
beer
drinks
very
well
with
brunch
and
could
certainly
be
a
summer
days
best
friend
by
the
pool
or
grill
tasty
clean
simple
and
delicious
prost
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
yet
to
run
across
good
looks
good
to
the
nose
and
very
good
on
the
palate
d
high
due
to
its
sweetness
this
bottle
poured
out
a
goldenyellow
witha
nice
white
sparkling
head
that
quickly
dissappeared
the
aroma
was
of
yeast
and
bread
the
body
was
mediumlight
and
the
taste
was
of
citrusbread
and
yeast
characters
this
was
a
very
refreshing
and
delicious
beerand
another
great
offering
from
the
great
ayinger
brewery
i
dont
rate
it
as
high
on
drikability
as
i
do
the
hefes
but
it
has
a
good
drinkable
quality
to
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
a
flavorful
as
some
in
this
style
the
munich
helles
is
a
great
crossover
from
american
macro
pilsner
lagers
flavor
is
malt
honey
and
lemon
rind
sweetbread
sile
kings
hawaiian
bread
with
lemon
jam
on
top
ok
not
really
but
its
the
best
i
can
do
sweet
clean
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
hop
at
the
end
very
tasty
very
drinkable
less
reviewin
more
drinkin
im
taking
a
liking
to
this
beer
if
the
smell
wasnt
so
unusual
it
would
probably
be
amongst
my
favorites
in
the
lager
styles
aw
shucks
ive
just
tried
it
for
the
first
time
and
its
already
getting
me
all
maudlin
or
is
it
the
stress
talking
or
perhaps
this
as
a
result
of
it
managing
some
stress
release
a
charming
little
beer
you
just
want
to
pinch
its
cheeks
and
take
it
home
to
feed
it
a
nice
warm
bowl
of
soup
before
sending
it
back
on
its
way
thats
the
feeling
ill
get
every
time
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
now
i
dont
know
how
faithful
this
is
the
helles
style
not
having
much
personal
experience
with
the
style
but
damn
is
it
good
this
is
one
hell
of
a
session
brew
damn
i
wish
i
could
get
a
few
cases
of
this
close
to
home
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
produced
a
large
white
head
over
a
very
light
golden
body
with
plenty
of
small
bubbles
smell
of
hay
and
wheat
with
piney
and
metallic
hops
nice
taste
is
pretty
broad
for
a
helles
lager
some
complexity
of
wheat
straw
crackers
with
a
citrus
note
or
two
dominated
by
the
nice
hop
dryness
and
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
with
light
refreshing
carbonation
very
drinkable
at
5
5
its
probably
just
out
of
the
session
beer
range
but
still
quite
quaffable
nice
beer
go
get
some
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
a
bit
of
carbonation
tingle
on
the
tongue
with
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
as
it
goes
down
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
id
probably
buy
it
again
when
i
feel
like
something
different
from
my
normal
strong
ales
cheers
i
liked
this
beer
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
i
think
its
still
worth
a
try
i
got
the
current
bottle
at
the
german
gourmet
in
falls
church
va
which
i
visited
for
the
first
time
this
week
if
german
cuisine
is
your
thing
this
is
an
unbelievable
store
in
particular
the
beer
and
wine
selection
is
huge
the
jahrhundert
pours
a
yellow
straw
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
there
is
a
very
nice
malthops
aroma
coming
out
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
between
those
components
right
through
the
finish
its
a
little
spritzier
than
id
like
but
some
might
find
that
energizing
after
a
few
good
stuff
drinkability
is
exceptional
as
well
i
could
drink
this
anytime
of
year
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
just
sitting
around
the
house
in
a
snow
storm
as
i
am
right
now
i
will
go
back
for
more
of
this
one
d
the
moderate
alcohol
content
fresh
distinct
taste
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
not
only
great
for
part
of
a
session
but
also
an
excellent
choice
for
those
days
where
youd
prefer
something
lighterbodied
refreshing
and
crisp
super
drinkable
perfect
summer
bier
eve
in
january
this
made
me
remember
some
great
biergarten
moments
drinkability
notes

great
summer
beer
sadly
its
the
middle
of
january
still
tasty
but
ill
have
to
try
it
again
in
6
months
to
see
if
i
like
the
smooth
easy
drinking
flavor
on
a
hotter
day
hazy
murky
straw
like
appearance
champagnebubbly
carbonation
that
helps
solidify
a
soapy
white
head
subtle
nosebready
and
grainy
notes
as
the
beverage
is
sipped
more
fruity
notes
banana
peel
and
lemons
are
noted
a
rather
suprising
chewy
start
spicy
floral
hops
crisp
carbonation
and
lightly
toasted
malts
the
body
is
quite
rich
and
creamy
the
munich
malts
are
the
key
player
here
with
some
dry
hoppiness
in
the
body
medium
bodied
warming
shows
the
doughy
characteristics
that
allow
for
a
very
smooth
finish
this
helles
takes
me
back
to
my
days
in
germany
and
has
gimme
a
brat
and
a
bier
written
all
over
it
a
winner
and
one
that
should
indeed
satisfy
the
wide
range
of
ba
tastebuds
poured
a
nice
two
finger
head
slighty
cloudy
golden
color
great
carbonation
and
brussells
lace
the
little
sediment
that
poured
out
was
kept
floating
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
because
of
the
high
carbonation
smelled
a
nice
hoppy
and
estery
green
apples
and
lemon
tasted
of
green
apples
with
a
nice
hop
note
very
light
and
semitart
palate
very
eay
to
drink
and
a
good
recommendation
for
a
session
beer
this
beer
pours
a
foggy
straw
color
and
leaves
a
very
sticky
white
lace
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
appearance
is
foggy
with
some
golden
hues
throughout
as
i
taste
this
beer
the
grass
malt
lemon
honey
and
the
very
slightest
taste
of
grapefruit
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
malty
the
beer
just
cleanses
the
palate
with
crisp
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
semisweet
with
a
honey
lemon
finish
this
is
a
great
style
my
first
time
trying
it
and
one
i
will
go
back
to
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
tall
fluffy
head
that
fell
to
a
thin
film
of
bubbles
smells
absolutely
fantastic
with
hints
of
apples
bananas
play
dough
red
liquorish
and
an
over
all
dry
smoothness
tastes
like
a
grassy
oat
and
wheat
malt
that
dries
out
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
edges
of
my
tongue
with
a
slight
grapefruit
rind
finish
in
the
middle
there
is
an
intermittent
banana
and
black
pepper
sweetens
between
the
initial
grains
and
the
final
dryness
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
but
on
the
verge
of
being
too
carbonated
over
all
this
is
a
well
done
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
also
ive
noticed
that
this
beer
tastes
way
better
in
the
half
liter
bottle
as
opposed
to
the
12
oz
or
330
ml
bottles
pours
a
straw
colored
pale
yellow
with
thick
white
head
smells
of
a
malty
bread
and
bits
of
lemon
and
grapes
there
is
a
flowery
nose
to
this
also
taste
is
grainy
with
bits
of
honey
and
flowers
there
is
a
good
hop
balance
that
doesnt
over
power
this
beer
really
good
taste
to
this
beer
with
a
nice
carbonartion
amount
very
tasty
with
the
grains
coming
back
as
an
aftertaste
very
drinkable
even
the
feel
of
the
brew
is
dainty
this
would
make
a
good
summer
brew
but
now
in
late
fall
this
just
doesnt
fit
the
bill
no
points
deducted
for
me
drinking
in
the
wrong
season
opinion
now
this
is
a
good
beer
aying
makes
good
beer
anyway
but
this
is
one
of
their
best
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
if
this
one
were
available
here
in
texas
where
i
could
find
it
i
would
drink
this
beer
on
a
very
regular
basis
thumbs
up
it
has
a
malty
aftertaste
followed
by
a
little
point
of
pungent
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
bright
white
head
that
takes
its
time
to
settle
decent

and

slight
biscuity
malt
taste
was
is
clean
and
dry
with
some
light
citrus
notes
over
a
nice
strong
malt
and
finishing
with
a
rather
light
hop
note
just
enough
to
give
a
hint
of
bitterness
theres
a
sweet
honeyish
aftertaste
which
is
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
good
level
of
carbonation
though
this
is
a
really
good
lager
simple
and
refreshing
but
full
flavored
the
body
is
quite
light
and
crisp
from
the
carbonation
there
is
a
tiny
hop
bite
in
the
finish
good
but
nothing
spectacular
and
not
just
because
it
is
a
light
beer
ayingers
jahrhundert
is
a
firm
lager
that
shows
whats
best
about
german
lager
brewing
but
with
added
body
flavor
and
confidence
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
frothy
monster
of
a
head
lacing
will
coat
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
honey
toasted
grains
hints
of
lemon
coreandor
a
nice
soft
buttery
hue
the
taste
is
fabulous
light
but
damn
tasty
the
grains
are
mixed
with
a
light
melon
a
slight
banana
yeast
with
a
hint
of
lemon
perfect
for
anything
goes
good
with
a
dinner
watching
a
ballgame
or
just
sitting
down
relaxing
ah
perfecto
the
look
is
of
a
strawlike
apple
juice
color
topped
with
a
modest
head
not
highly
filtered
either
there
is
apple
and
nutmeg
on
the
nose
as
well
as
a
sweet
cream
scent
it
is
heavy
on
the
apple
in
taste
but
in
a
good
way
no
gross
artificial
taste
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
rather
disappointing
but
it
was
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
overall
love
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
citrus
lemon
with
some
grain
the
flavor
is
tasty
with
some
of
the
citrus
notes
and
very
smooth
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
pours
a
lightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
less
than
a
finger
the
nose
is
grainey
but
not
harsh
light
lemon
notes
hit
its
very
clean
the
flavor
is
very
grainey
but
again
not
harsh
very
flavorful
and
clean
very
nice
beer
flavors
dont
hold
on
too
long
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
im
very
impressed
with
this
one
im
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
reall
like
the
clean
lines
it
will
never
be
my
favortie
but
its
good
this
is
an
easily
quaffable
beer
its
a
step
up
from
lawn
mower
beers
if
you
go
into
the
tasting
thinking
delicate
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
if
you
are
looking
a
big
powerful
lager
this
one
will
disappoint
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
that
lingers
nicely
nose
has
pleasant
herbal
notes
but
grains
are
nondistinct
smoothly
malted
at
the
start
with
balanced
hops
that
take
over
into
the
aftertaste
giving
this
one
a
mildly
bitter
though
not
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
and
somehow
fitting
for
this
lager
im
a
fan

the
standard

well
crafted
i
could
drink
dozens
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
world
class
authentic
lager
just
made
for
sessions
let
me
preface
the
review
with
this
i
really
enjoyed
the
all
the
other
beers
from
this
brewery
so
far
i
wish
this
one
had
measured
up
to
the
fine
standard
franz
inselkammer
has
set
with
their
other
offerings
the
beer
pours
out
the
color
of
pale
golden
straw
a
big
fluffy
head
forms
and
leaves
behind
some
lace
smell
is
almost
missing
in
action
light
hops
and
lighter
malt
are
the
only
notes
found
taste
is
a
bit
hoppy
without
being
bitter
but
there
is
not
much
to
taste
either
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
a
medium
body
drinkability
could
be
so
much
higher
if
it
had
something
to
taste
in
the
end
this
was
more
like
a
german
version
of
an
american
megabrew
offering
a
disappointing
beer
my
only
hope
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
is
that
i
simply
got
a
bad
bottle
i
might
try
it
again
down
the
road
this
is
pretty
much
the
perfect
session
beer
it
tastes
like
a
nap
in
a
bavarian
field
it
is
a
lot
more
earthy
than
anything
youd
expect
from
a
beer
thats
also
so
light
anfd
fluffy
the
head
lingers
well
and
there
is
some
lacing
your
90
year
old
grandma
could
drink
this
all
night
and
awake
the
next
morning

week
i
tried

and
was
very
impressed
it
was
my
first
of
this
style
but
definitely
not
my
last
of
those
babies
so
since
i
liked
that
so
much
when
i
saw
this
lager
by
the
same
brewery
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
there
was
a
moment
of
hesitation
when
i
got
home
and
took
the
bottles
from
the
four
pack
and
realized
there
was
actually
fuzz
and
dust
in
the
bottom
of
the
carrier
it
was
then
i
noticed
the
layer
of
dust
on
the
bottles
uhoh
in
my
haste
did
i
just
toss
my
hard
earned
money
away
on
something
that
has
been
sitting
around
since
george
w
bush
was
only
an
embarrassment
to
texans
lo
my
fears
were
unwarranted
i
dont
know
how
old
this
brew
is
but
it
was
great
so
i
dont
care
give
it
a
try
its
worth
it
pours
a
light
transparent
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
is
mammoth
and
brilliantly
white
with
considerable
staying
power
small
strands
of
bubbles
rise
consistently
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
is
a
nicelooking
brew
the
aroma
is
mix
of
malty
musty
and
floral
sensations
with
a
bit
of
citrus
hidden
in
the
back
the
beer
starts
just
mildly
sweet
then
truns
to
a
grainy
grassy
flavor
the
flavor
is
quite
intense
where
the
aroma
is
present
but
restrained
light
and
tasty
this
is
an
exquisitely
drinkable
beer
beers
like
this
are
the
reasons
why
german
beers
have
such
a
great
reputation
pours
an
oh
so
slightly
clouded
straw
yellow
colior
with
a
nice
full
bright
white
head
tastes
nice
and
sweet
with
a
great
hoppy
nip
in
the
end
malts
are
full
of
flavor
for
the
style
and
the
hops
add
such
wonderful
balancee
this
is
a
top
notch
basic
german
lager
that
is
worth
a
sample
if
you
see
it
there
is
a
little
white
head
atop
this
straw
gold
body
the
aroma
is
lemony
with
some
light
grain
malt
scent
as
well
sweet
malt
up
front
nice
hop
contrast
hints
of
lemon
light
bodied
refreshing
this
is
one
of
those
great
tasting
brews
that
you
could
put
a
bunch
down
this
is
a
summer
beer
that
has
a
little
body
and
alot
of
flavor
i
really
liked
this
beer
update
i
sampled
a
2011
vintage
and
this
really
is
a
terrific
bier
the
grain
is
strong
yet
incredibly
sensual
and
the
hops
usually
too
light
for
americans
taste
are
actually
quite
strong
here
and
create
an
expertly
balanced
brew
a
beer
that
doesnt
fit
well
in
the
hellestype
category
which
is
fine
by
me
as
i
tend
to
find
them
drinkable
but
bland
instead
it
is
a
tart
beer
that
reminds
me
more
of
belgian
session
beers
than
the
typical
german
beer
very
nice
this
poured
a
pale
and
hazy
straw
yellow
color
a
small
creamy
bright
white
meringuelike
head
topped
off
this
beer
the
aroma
is
light
and
has
a
grainy
sweetness
along
with
a
pleasant
floral
hoppiness
a
light
tasting
beer
but
with
a
solid
body
of
malt
overall
this
is
light
and
estery
with
small
hints
of
sweet
fruit
and
an
inviting
hop
bitterness
that
seems
just
right
in
this
beer
a
satisfying
soft
lager
beer
that
is
easily
drinkable
this
one
was
somewhat
disappointing
to
me
as
i
normally
love
ayinger
products
the
hundred
year
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
that
had
a
small
quickly
disappearing
head
it
smelled
primarily
of
the
malt
with
a
little
hoppiness
the
taste
though
is
a
kind
of
musty
malt
taste
it
is
very
fullbodied
in
the
mouth
but
is
not
as
satisfying
as
some
other
ayingers
not
bad
just
nothing
special
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
probably
shouldnt
have
been
surprised
seeing
as
how
ayinger
is
a
high
quality
brewery
but
nevertheless
i
was
it
may
be
a
bit
simple
for
some
but
i
fully
enjoyed
this
offering
from
the
little
brewery
in
aying
germany
ausgezeichnet
i
could
drink
this
like
water
without
thinking
that
im
drinking
water
and
for
that
im
awarding
a
5
in
drinkability
exceptional
is
right
this
is
a
fine
dandy
drinker
of
a
beer
perfect
for
warmer
weather
days
or
even
any
ol
time
as
a
session
brew
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
a
bitter
clean
finish
a
great
lager
in
my
book
a
nice
helles
superior
drinkability
balances
all
the
flavor
components
well
probably
one
of
the
top
3
lagers
in
the
world
overall
i
was
thoughly
impressed
with
this
one
and
will
buy
again

this
was
a
very
fine
looking
lager
it
pours
out
of
the
bottle
as
a
wonderrful
light
golden
color
there
was
a
nice
foamy
offwhite
head
the
smell
and
taste
were
somewhat
neuatral
neither
hoppy
or
malty
this
beer
was
not
bad
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
search
out
again
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
recedes
leaving
a
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
weak
but
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
are
noticable
flavor
is
sweet
bready
malts
and
a
touch
of
barely
there
noble
hops
body
is
surprisingly
full
not
going
to
pass
itself
off
as

or
hundred

beer
a
creamy
sweetness
very
flavorful
when
compared
to
other
beers
that
pour
this
light
in
color
the
bitterness
is
tame
but
balances
the
beer
so
well
with
the
no

dominating
here
very

mouthfeel
its
not

believe
it
or
not
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
slow

is
superb
for
any

fan
this
one
hits
the
spot
after
a
stressful
day
with
two
exams
clear
light
golden

fluffy

and
a
little
sun
baked
hay

is
about
medium
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
taste
is
herbal
grassy
malty
in
a
bohemian
kind
of
way
and
also
appropriately
bitter
for
the
style
nice
combination
enjoyable
and
refreshing
light
overall
aroma
thats
made
up
of
a
light
sweet
watery
and
slightly
grainy
malt
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
backing
clear
light
yellowgold
with
a
watery
look
to
it
medium
sized
white
fizzy
head
that
subsides
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
flavor
is
a
mix
of
a
malt
base
grainy
quality
but
with
hop
bitterness
present
and
firm
a
little
strong
for
style
helles
long
dry
and
bitter
finish
that
is
also
rather
crisp
leaving
a
thirst
quenching
quality
fairly
carbonated
which
keeps
it
feeling
heavier
that
it
is
but
also
adds
some
fluffiness
develops
some
smoothness
in
time
i
was
hoping
for
better
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
readily
available
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
this
beer
pours
a
huge
head
of
big
bubbles
quickly
filling
my
weissepilsner

an
interesting
display
of

flavor
notes
including
vanilla
cinnamon
and
apples
along
with
a
variety
of

very
light
on

at
the
finish
my
favorite
lager
this
brew
poured
a
very
large
white
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
lasting
and
a
cloudy
wheat
yellow
body
with
a
mild
hoppy
aroma
and
the
flavor
of
fizzy
banana
and
hops
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
with
a
slight
bite
to
its
finish

originally
sampled
this

i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
for
me
there
was
nothing
about
this
beer
that
stood
out
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
certainly
wasnt
impressed
by
it
it
was
rather
bland
overall
a
very
good
quality
lager
imported
by
merchant
du

i
have
just
noted
1

for
the
bottle
was
not
too
bad
for
this
high
quality
helles
bier
i
thought
makes
a
great
thirst
quencher
and
a
very
refreshing
lager
for
a
very
warm
night
crystal

clean

looking

the
beer

makes
me
yearn

overall
i
give
this

marks
on
the

side
just
a
very
pleasant
beer
one
that
i
can
imagine
drinking
in
quantity
in
the
warmer
months
thanks
to
the
guys
at

grand
ave
liquors
for
selling
me
one
of
four
preview
bottles
very
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
golden
lager
by
any
shot
id
say
this
probably
ranks
for
the
style
of
golden
lagers
excludng
pilsners
up
with
the
max
lagers
reserve
lager
theres
not
a
lot
of
hops
going
on
but
there
is
a
maltiness
that
is
pleasant
and
lightly
sweet
the
body
is
probably
on
the
darker
end
of
the
golden
style
but
the
carbonation
was
plentiful
but
not
overbearing
a
nicely
crafted
lager
the
strawpale
golden
body
with
a
big
pure
white
foamy
head
is
a
oneofakind
in
a
league
of
its
own
i
drank
the
first
one
too
fast
to
notice
the
lace
so
i
popped
open
another
and
noticed
some
sticky
lace
the
floral
hop
and
lightly
roasted
malt
lasts
a
good
long
time
the
lightly
roasted
malt
is
heavier
than
it
appears
and
possesses
a
pleasing
sweetness
a
bountiful
sharpedged
bitterness
is
lightly
tempered
with
caramel
notes
a
faint
note
of
vanilla
is
detected
balances
slightly
although
the
hoppiness
remains
dominant
hmmm
grilled
bratwurst
would
hit
the
spot
right
about
now
this
particular
brew
poured
a
large
white
long
lasting
head
the
lacing
was
not
very
good
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
this
brew
had
a
yellow
body
to
it
and
a
cloudy
appearance
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
to
it
it
was
very
bitter
tasting
in
my
opinion
which
isnt
a
taste
that
i
enjoy
all
that
much
an
aftertaste
was
also
observed
i
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
the
weisse
from
ayinger
but
the
lagers
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
nonetheless
this
is
what
i
can
say
is
a
classic
german
lager
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
clean
malty
and
fresh
just
like
the
description
reminded
me
instantly
of
some
of
the
beer
i
had
in
duesseldorf
a
couple
years
ago
has
that
german
taste
to
it
i
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
but
i
would
drink
it
again
not
a
dissapointment
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
out
of
this
one
especially
since
its
their
anniversary
beer
it
just
didnt
have
that
oomph
that
i
thought
it
would
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgold
color
with
a
medium
sized
fluffy
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
leaves
a
sticky
lace
aromas
are
of
mild
hops
with
some
undertones
of
yeast
bread
the
taste
was
a
mixture
of
fresh
baked
bread
citrus
fruit
and
earthy
hops
there
was
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
left
in
my
mouth
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
what
but
this
one
just
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
this
beer
pours
a
hazysome
particulates
yelloworange
color
with
a
large
very
bubbly
disappating
white
head
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
rounded
and
effervescent
the
smell
is
rich
almostbut
not
quite
smoky
the
taste
is
round
malty
with
a
sweet
hoppy
finish
a
pleasant
drinkable
brew
a
smooth
medium
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
enjoyable
along
with
some
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
with
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
a
very
enjoyable
lager
most
definitely
worth
a
try
i
had
this
head
to
head
with
weihenstephaner
original
my
favorite
lager
this
more
than
held
its
own
pours
a
duvellike
meringue
head
which
took
a
while
to
disapate
nice
fresh
malt
taste
quite
clean
and
refreshing
like
another
reviewer
said
this
is
what
a
b
should
be
making
everything
you
could
want
in
this
style
beer
seems
to
have
a
decent
kick
and
would
rate
right
up
there
with
the
weihenstephaner
paulaner
original
munich
and
sammy
smiths
lager
as
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
pours
very
nice
pale
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
look
is
slightly
opaque
and
the
head
lingers
nicely
after
settling
into
a
thin
layer
the
lacing
is
lasting
and
full
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
bready
full
of
malt
the
taste
is
quite
nice
with
a
slight
citrus
hint
and
good
bitterness
over
the
sweetness
that
seems
shortlived
good
aftertaste
after
the
creamy
mouthfeel
although
somewhat
astringent
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
munchener
style
light
lager
that
id
go
back
to
if
it
were
easily
available
nicely
bottled
and
presented
great
capping
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
gold
gives
off
a
tight

leaves
a
thin

behind
a
mostly
hop

is
present
fresh

to
mind

taste

slightly

too
a
really
enjoyable
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
good
with
some
nice
malts
it
has
the
good
qualities
o
f
a
german
brew
a
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
smooth
as
silk
there
is
a
dougy
characteristic
that
makes
this
an
interesing
beer
i
was
expecting
a
bigger
and
darker
beer
as
a
century
celebration
lager
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
this
is
very
much
a
munich
helles
with
some
added
hop
character
it
showcases
the
hops
as
well
as
a
very
nice
round
malt
but
its
also
superbly
balanced
and
very
drinkable
id
love
to
try
an
even
fresher
example
as
i
know
that
some
of
the
hop
character
has
been
lost
here
delicate
allaround
and
highly
enjoyable
i
cannot
help
but
loathe
this
beer
the
bouquet
is
horrible
and
it
soils
almost
everything
about
it
i
had
to
pour
it
out
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
long
in
the
tooth
since
i
noticed
some
aspects
not
noted
by
other
reviewers
appearance
was
a
little
cloudy
for
the
style
listed
here
as
a
dortumunder
but
on
the
bottle
there
was
a
notation
helles
export
aroma
was
a
little
yeasty
and
at
the
front
the
flavor
was
likewise
yeasty
and
a
little
bready
almost
like
a
weizen
good
solid
mouthfeel
a
little
unrefined
overall
not
a
bad
bier
but
did
not
really
grab
my
interest
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
sinks
slowly
and
a
nice
lace
down
the
glass
nice
biscuity
malt
aroma
to
this
one
that
is
balanced
out
by
the
earthy
hoppiness
of
the
noble
hops
used
great
biscuity
malt
character
that
gives
the
bier
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
the
hops
were
a
little
more
subtle
that
expected
but
were
still
very
nice
as
they
provided
a
great
balance
to
this
brew
awesomely
drinkable
brew
with
its
smooth
creaminess
and
excellent
flavor
i
dont
generally
like
a
lot
of
the
lager
styles
of
bier
but
this
was
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
talk
about
standing
to
attention
not
only
does
the
head
on
this
beer
look
like
meringue
the
lace
also
peaks
like
fluffy
egg
whites
quite
a
sight
im
all
with
the
others
on
the
citrusy
finish
it
left
my
mouth
squeaky
clean
and
indeed
it
is
refreshing
i
am
more
awake
after
drinking
this
baby

the
huge
fluffy
white
head
settles
painfully
slowly
its
a
notch
darker
than
a
pilsner
and
is
yellowish
gold
in
color
clarity
is
excellent
soft
slightty
grainy
notes
in
the
aroma
with
only
a
hint
of
a
herbal
noble
hop
nose
clean
aroma
overall
but
not
too
exciting
a
clean
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
flavor
but
a
clean
hop
bitterness
does
a
fine
job
of
both
balancing
the
malt
sweetness
and
adding
to
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
theres
a
bit
of
a
nondescript
grassy
finish
but
the
taste
is
overall
clean
and
balanced
borderlining
on
being
bland
although
jahrhudert
is
a
well
brewed
beer
it
leaves
me
craving
a
good
helles
which
has
many
of
the
same
qualities
albeit
with
a
more
pronounced
malt
character
notes
first
brewed
in
1978
in
celebration
of
the
100th
anniversary
for
brewery
aying
a
great
choice
for
this
creation
a
wonderful
malt
profile
this
beer
makes
you
crave
for
more
very
appetizing
went
well
with
some
dark
rye
bread
and
mild
goat
cheese
real
nice
slight

smellnice
and

could
drink
alot
of
this

than
the
dortmunder
gold
of

lakes
brewingmuch
more
delecate
liked
em
both
havent
had
to
many
dortmunder
syles
but
iam
sure
this
is
a
standard
something
to
drink
when
eating
a
light
meal
clear
golden
lager
rising
up
to
a
wonderful

dish
that
i
had

this

tastes

out
the

some
may

i
certainly
do

enjoy
in
the
other
green

lagers
it
has
a
clean
smooth
finish
with
an
enjoyable
light
hop

this
would
pair
nicely
with
homemade
borscht
overall
i
found
that
baltika
7
eksportnoe
was
quite
easy
to
drink
and
it
did
the
business
after
a
long
day
of
work
having
said
that
though
there
was
a
small
aftertaste
that
was
quite
strong
but
that
brought
a
nice
balance
to
the
beer
and
i
recommend
this
as
a
good
session
beer
overall
better
than
average
had
a
fruity
taste
than
i
expected
i
would
drink
this
again

a
c
baltika
7
is
a
passable
euro
lager
but
its
a
weak
attempt
at
a
dortmunder
if
thats
even
what
they
were
going
for
one
thing
i
will
say
is
that
this
is
easily
the
best
russian
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
to
be
honest
i
havent
had
very
many
and
the
others
were
pretty
terrible
baltika
7
is
no
masterpiece
but
id
have
no
issue
with
drinking
another
bottle
here
and
there
but
that
being
said
german
and
polish
lagers
are
better
easier
to
find
and
often
cheaper
so
this
ones
utility
is
rather
limited
o
not
a
great
lager
even
in
my
current
surroundings
o
simple
basic
straightup
lager
not
a
fan
and
will
not
have
again
drinkable
although
too
much
sweetness
after
being
told
about
this
whole
baltika
line
by
a
former
coworker
i
was
relatively
jazzed
to
find
a
few
at
my
local
caputos
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
goldenstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wild
rice
generic
grain
light
flowers
very
light
grass
and
a
splash
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
a
firm
semibiscuit
backbone
is
evident
and
the
flowers
provide
a
cleaner
hop
thrust
than
before
still
everything
just
kinda
lies
there
mostly
lifeless
certainly
characterless
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickly
watery
feel
overall
this
is
just
a
boring
unassuming
little
guy
something
id
likely
confuse
with
any
other
bland
euro
lager
its
not
bad
per
se
just
nothing
id
ever
really
wanna
drink
again
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
more
pale
yellow
than
most
euro
lagers
and
has
a
little
hint
of
rice
in
the
aroma
it
is
pretty
nice
despite
it
probably
having
some
adjuncts
in
it
it
is
refreshing
with
a
light
taste
and
good
aftertaste
ill
admit
this
is
probably
not
something
ill
be
buying
a
lot
of
although
it
is
a
fine
effort
from
baltika
and
certainly
better
than
some
of
their
nonexport
beers
on
the
lower
range
of
drinkability
among
pilsners
i
found
it
a
bit
too
heavy
given
its
buttery
notes
on
a
sweet
malty
base
number
4
is
still
their
best
bet
the
flavor
has
a
little
more
character
with
grainy
malts
astringency
and
a
slightly
lingering
clean
hop
finale

right
down

blasé

fine

i

this
up
again

i
liked

wouldnt

a

still
not
my

im
not
the
sort
to

while
i
do

such
but
if
i
were
i
suppose
id
drink
something
like
this
i
see
baltika
7s
chief
selling
point
being
that
it
is
a
worthy
substitute
for
water
i
suppose
thats
not
saying
much
well
i
was
expecting
a
metrictonne
shitloads
worth
of
euroskank
given
the
clear
green
bottle
and
other
unjust
prejudices
turns
out
one
should
not
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
as
this
is
a
decently
malty
softlytinged
hoppy
eurolager
maybe
not
up
to
the
stringent
standards
of
the
teutonic
style
source
but
still
agreeable
enough
mea
culpa

overall
the
first
half

it
just
drops

if

will
easily
buy
again
great

overall
aside
from
the
skunking
which
was
my

it
was
a
light
crisp

refreshing
beer
and
definitely
a
good
sessionable
beer
at
that
it
fits
all
the
guidelines
but
if
it
wasnt
for
my
mistake
it
probably
wouldve
been
a
little
higher
but
it
probably
shouldnt
be
in
a

all
it
takes
is
30
seconds
of
sunlight
overall
i
didnt
hate
this
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
i
really
hate
the
belgian

european
yeast

hops
so
i
didnt
go
into
this
expecting
much

not
even
close

best
beers
that
i
was

to
enjoy
on

it
likely
doesnt
travel
well
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
but
in
the
motherland
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
i
would
seek
this
out
if
i
was
in
russia
again
dr
in
spite
of
its
balance
issues
it
does
maintain
a
certain
perverted
refreshment
capability
in
its
first
half
i
wish
theyd
clean
up
the
latter
bit
but
it
does
have
some
value
it
isnt
worth
its
price
in
ireland
but
is
likely
worth
it
in
other
locations
if
youre
looking
strictly
to
get
bollocksed
in
general
i
think
its
a
beer
to
be
avoided

youre

serious
beer
fanatic

beer

faded

skunky
smell

hint
of
lemon

taste
is
mostly
grassy
with
some
sweet
cereal
flavors

the
background
there
is
also
a
slight
lemon
and
bread
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
and
fizzy
the
finish
is
just
a
bit
dry
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
tastes
like
most
euro
lagers
o
i
thought
this
was
a
good
middleoftheroad
lager
nothing
special
but
a
good
beer
for
watching
sports
or
washing
down
a
pizza
o
decent
lager
fit
for
both
proletariat
and
bourgeois
not
overly
complex
but
with
a
nice
body
and
fairly
easy
to
knock
back
as
an
import

this
lager
is
not
competitive
with
many
other
domestic
and
imports
whether
on
price
or
interest
or
quality
one
of
the
first
russian
beers
i
had
ever
had
this
brew
reminded
me
of

becks
the
color
was
a
yellowish
gold
the
aroma
wasa
little
grassy
and
had
a
but
of
a
funk
to
it
the
taste
was
bitter
in
the
same
ways
as
the
aroma
the
brew
seemed
to
be
much
like
a
german
lager
and
not
so
much
of
a
russian
one
ahh
the
crack
glug
sometimes
the
best
part
of
a
can
of
beer
i
have
come
to
really
appreciate
the
auditory
nature
of
cans
i
achieved
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
very
limited

nose

characteristic

sweetness
free
of
adjuncts
i
am
in
lust
i
am
so
sick
of
aals
in
a
can
that
i
could
scream
i
may
have
to
order
up
some
more
of
this
now
that
i
have
a
source
identified
mouthfeel
was
tending
towards
thin
and
it
had
a
very
dry
taste
to
it
very
little
sweetness
of
which
to
speak
instead
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
bettermade
minhas
with
a
light
cotton
candy
flavor
and
no

hmm
finish
was
likewise
dry
and
refreshing

would

this

there
is
also
a
grainy
sort
of
grassy
note
here
too
tastes
mildly
hoppy
almost
skunky
it
has
a
little
bit
of
a
crispness
to
it
but
that
is
overshadowed
by
its
watery
texture
mouthfeel
is
like
water
the
only
reason
i
know
its
not
water
is
because
it
is
carbonated
would
not
have
again
this
is
a
drain
pour

potential

comrade
i
dont
like
wasting
beer
and
halfway
through
i
was
struggling
to
enjoy
this
but
its
not
like
a
keystone
that
id
openly
dump
out
in
the
backyard
and
while
its
more
expensive
id
choose
this
over
keystone
because
while
the
taste
isnt
great
at
least
it
has
a
taste
and
does
put
hair
on
your
chest
figuratively
at
least
i
hope
that
and
drinking
this
beer
allowed
me
to
write
a
review
of
it
with
overthetop
cold
warera
metaphors
youre
welcome
if
you
can
find

very
crispy
rye
bread

with
garlic
and
mozzerella
7
fits
well
with
them
for
a
night
of
drinking
in
st
petersburg
i
did
not
like
this
beer
it
was
fresh
part
of
the
lcbo
gift
pack
no
direct
sunlight
though
you
cannot
stop
the
less
disasterous
flourescent
lighting
in
the
store
the
beer
had
a
light
yellow
colour
to
it
carbonation
bubbleswere
apparent
and
there
was
a
big
cheesy
head
the
horse
and
cheese
aromas
made
it
unapproachable
boozy
and
sugary
watery
pours
a
clear
yellow
colour
with
small
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
fairly
quickly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
at
all
this
smells
fairly
bad
atually
though
the
bottle
is
fresh
i
believe
i
dont
get
any
hops
hardly
any
malt
no
real
bitterness
big
carbonation
level
i
dont
want
to
have
this
again
poured
a
1
5
head
which
dissipated
pretty
quickly
pale
pee
yellow
in
color
aroma
has
hops
and
citrus
taste
is
standard
cheap
lager
with
corn
and
not
much
else
id
say
though
this
is
equal
or
better
to
most
of
the
american
versions
of
cheap
lager
and
im
grateful
due
to
the
can
it
didnt
have
even
a
hint
of
skunking
despite
all
the
time
and
distance
between
its
foreign
brewery
and
my
mouth
refreashing
and
thirst
quenching
but
not
really
tastey
in
any
way
dry
rather
than
sweet
but
again
not
really
dry
either
this
beer
smells
like
an
india
pale
ale
ipa
which
i
really
hate
yet
it
tastes
about
like
coors
light
only
better
coors
light
is
strong
in
alcohol
but
weak
in
flavor
still
id
choose
this
beer
above
coors
light
dammit
if
i
werent
so
poor
because
even
though
similar
it
does
taste
much
better
than
coors
for
sure
clear
clear
clear
if
it
wasnt
for
a
slight
yellow
tint
i
would
think
it
was
water
wow
it
is
crystal
clear
the
pure
white
head
is
about
one
finger
thick
the
nose
has
a
barely
noticeable
skunkiness
to
it
but
nothing
else
some
soft
bitterness
and
maybe
a
grassy
note
on
the
end
there
is
nothing
to
this
beer
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
will
score
low
not
because
its
not
any
good
but
because
there
is
nothing
to
it
dortmunder
is
a
working
mans
kind
of
beer
it
is
a
simple
but
substantial
style
that
is
naturally
gifted
in
the
ways
of
quenching
thirst
and
providing
clean
wholesome
sustenance
for
those
nights
were
the
rounds
just
seem
to
keep
coming
it
is
a
prime
example
of
the
kind
of
proud
and
efficient
engineering
for
which
the
germans
are
renown
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
while
doing
some
chores
in
the
heat
but
would
definitely
avoid
it
in
the
future
drinkability
a
decently
drinkable
little
lager
this
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
and
probably
a
good
tailgating
beer
id
like
to
see
it
around
here
in
cans
would
pair
nice
with
veggie
burgers
and
some
waffle
fries
or
you
could
pair
it
with
something
spicy
it
would
provide
a
refreshing
counterpart
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
lemon
grain
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
lemons
wheat
and
grain
not
too
much
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
not
skunky
like
so
many
greenbottled
beers
overall
the
beer
is
better
than
i
expected
easy
drinking
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
somewhat
boring
at
the
same
time
drinkability
not
bad
but
pretty
average
overall
i
would
be
willing
to
drink
this
again
but
not
ahead
of
many
many
other
things
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
worth
a
shot
when
you
see
it
poured
from
a
green
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
crisp
a
bit
sweet
malts
and
finishes
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
brew
nothing
to
recommend
this
one
pretty
anonymous
like
a
zillion
other
eastern
euro
macros
drinkable
but
not
interesting
or
exciting
picked
up
a
6pack
of
green
11
2oz
bottles
the
poptop
opener
was
a
real
crowd
pleaser
poured
into
pint
glass
appearance
was
light
yellow
some
bubbles
and
head
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
light
carbonation
taste
was
better
than
expected
not
as
skunky
as
other
easter
european
beers
sweet
and
malty
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
drinkablility
this
is
a
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
goes
great
on
a
hot
day
like
it
was
yesterday
nothing
special
but
great
to
have
around
when
finished
cutting
the
grass
if
i
dont
think
about
it
too
much
its
really
not
a
bad
lager
better
than
most
american
macros
this
is
a
drinking
beer
not
a
tasting
beer
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
bottle
with
freshness
date
on
back
of
label
poured
into
my
baltika
glass
bright
yellow
color
with
no
head
and
not
much
added
carbonation
refreshing
lager
with
some
very
minor
hints
of
spice
and
hops
slight
metalic
after
flavor
seems
like
a
good
solid
choice
for
a
lager
on
a
warm
day
on
my
trip
to
finish
this
entire
series
poured
a
500ml
green
bottle
into
my
hennepin
globe
glass
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
with
a
big
3
inch
bright
white
cap
that
leaves
just
a
little
lacing
a
steady
stream
of
tight
bubbles
emanate
from
the
sides
of
the
glass
replenishing
the
head
man
i
cracked
this
one
open
and
instantly
the
whole
room
spelled
like
green
bottle
funk
wow
i
had
a
5
just
a
bit
ago
which
came
in
a
clear
bottle
and
nothing
like
this
the
nose
is
well
funky
sulfur
from
the
spoiled
hops
bready
malts
and
sweet
corn
the
taste
is
exactly
the
same
no
difference
the
green
bottle
funk
definitely
overpowers
just
about
everything
reminds
me
of
grolsch
ive
had
beers
saison
dupont
comes
to
mind
where
the
bottle
funk
adds
just
a
subtle
layer
of
sulfur
to
the
flavor
profile
but
this
just
overwhelms
it
dang
and
the
say
the
use
less
hops
in
this
then
their
other
lagers
kind
of
scares
me
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
for
a
lager
overall
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
the
funk
is
just
to
much
this
starts
out
sweet
like
the
smell
but
then
finishes
with
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
i
expected
an
explosion
of
carbonation
but
was
met
with
very
little
this
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
but
didnt
find
it
as
anything
special
overall
excellent
lacing
and
the
baltika
glass
makes
this
a
compelling
drink
on
new
years
eve
although
i
bet
if
this
were
next
thursday
night
i
might
not
be
as
festively
aroused
by
its
aesthetics
pours
well
with
potato
skins
pizza
bites
and
mozzarella
sticks
d
its
cheap
and
the
abv
is
fairly
low
but
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
else
going
for
it
maybe
its
better
on
tap
in
russia
combination
of
taste
and
price
makes
this
a
quite
affordable
beer
to
sip
bottle
from
the
lcbo
sparkling
gold
pour
topped
with
a
foamy
bleached
white
cap
nose
of
grainy
malts
mild
grassy
hop
a
bit
skunky
to
be
honest
tastes
sweet
of
pale
malts
sharp
grassy
hop
a
bit
metallic
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
the
finish
overally
pretty
bland
drinkability
is
high
and
for
2bones
a
pint
i
will
buy
this
again

crisp
alcohol
gets
a

as
it

light
bodied
with

not

close
to
it
a
simple
lager
just
make
sure
you
dont

up

quickly
better
served
cold
well
its
an
export
luckily
it
only
gets
exported
here
in
christmas
gift
packs
heres
hoping
the
other
beers
in
the
pack
are
better
ugh
taste
unfortunately
follows
suit
closely
actually
worse
than
it
smells
due
to
a
molten
plastic
flavor
joining
the
aforementioned
foulness
from
the
aroma
tastes
like
groundwater
pumped
from
one
of
the
chemical
plants
on
the
ship
channel
drain
pour
for
sure
and
easily
the
worst
baltika
offering
i
have
had
green
bottle
with
a
cool
pulltab
cap
crystal
clear
and
possibly
the
palest
yellow
beer
ive
ever
seen
a
soapy
frothy
bright
white
cap
appeared
during
the
pour
and
remained
for
a
surprising
amount
of
time
streaky
and
spotty
lace
aromas
of
cereal
grain
barley
husk
hay
and
lemon
low
bitterness
sweet
yet
mild
flavour
a
bit
of
cereal
and
lemonlime
slightly
fruity
faint
mineral
finish
very
light
bodied
without
getting
to
the
point
of
being
watery
medium
to
low
carbonation
aided
the
texture
keeping
it
from
being
harsh
actually
it
was
fairly
smooth
quite
clean
and
refreshing
this
one
was
a
surprise
for
me
based
on
my
experience
with
this
line
of
products
easily
one
of
my
favourites
from
this
brewer
and
a
superb
lawnmower
beer
cheers
o
quite
drinkable
quite
honest
lager
there
are
much
better
baltika
options
bready
coarse
and
lightly
sweet
not
bad
i
scored
this
lager
as
average
across
the
board
so
it
got
a
c
its
not
a
yucky
c
just
average
glad
mine
wasnt
skunked
interesting
quite
sweetish
brew
however
not
a
champion
in
smoothness
leaves
a
sweetbitter
aftertaste
which
perhaps
makes
this
a
good
thirst
quencher
i
might
buy
this
again
depending
on
the
price
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crispy
lightbodied
and
drinkable
a
refreshing
brew
for
hot
weather
or
in
between
big
beers
as
a
palate
cleanser
maybe
for
the
price
it
is
better
than
heineken
and
looks
very
different
than
the
others
although
this
is
labeled
as
an
export
lager
it
seems
more
like
a
stella
artois
with
a
pinch
more
of
alcohol
at
least
this
beer
is
inexpensive
in
the
500
ml
bottles
overall
a
decent
adjunct
euro
lager
overall
not
a
bad
one
maybe
too
thin
thin
and
not
necessarily
pleasant
the
foam
was
light
wheatwhite
in
color
that
dissapated
quickly
but
a
small
ring
around
the
glass
til
the
end
the
smell
was
a
typical
crisp
hops
and
a
little
metallic
the
taste
was
sharp
light
very
hopsy
russias
version
of
the
american
lagers
and
pils
but
better
color
was
light
honey
wheat
mouthfeel
was
sharp
and
smooth
drinkibility
was
ok
the
taste
is
grain
with
lightly
herbal
hops
mostly
on
the
sweeter
side
with
a
light
bitterness
a
light
mineralwater
quality
is
noticeable
after
a
few
sips
the
taste
is
like
a
fuller
bodied
more
flavourful
basic
american
lager
more
than
a
european
one
its
basic
but
good
and
very
drinkable
do
not
recommend
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
lager
actually
it
is
quite
tasty
for
the
style
the
cap
on
the
bottle
is
different
as
well
kind
of
cool
dont
know
why
the
green
bottle
however
when
i
first
opened
this
beer
it
smelled
a
bit
skunky
but
that
went
away
pours
a
clear
light
gold
that
is
more
colorful
and
has
a
nicer
head
than
your
average
lager
nose
is
nothing
special
but
nothing
to
complain
about
a
clean
sweet
graininess
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
very
simple
but
dependable
i
taste
a
light
graininess
with
just
a
touch
of
lemony
hops
this
beer
is
not
great
but
definitely
not
worth
complaining
about
it
aspired
to
be
average
and
easily
hit
its
mark
a
slight
notch
above
the
regular
euro
lager
but
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
inoffensive
no
outright
unpleasant
characters
but
nothing
special
overall
dont
waste
your
time
on
spending
more
money
for
this
export
than
you
would
on
a
regular
american
beer
very
easy
to
drink
pale
clear
yellowgold
look
some
nice
lacing
and
a
generally
thin
head
aromas
had
a
weak
metallic
tone
with
typical
bread
characteristics
dry
taste
that
was
really
refreshing
actually
watery
and
light
allowing
a
smooth
taste
lagging
dull
bitter
taste
after
a
few
sips
overall
a
really
nice
light
drink
for
the
evening
another
note
this
might
be
a
great
transition
beer
for
people
who
are
macro
oriented
to
go
ahead
and
try
other
things
my
father
isnt
the
type
of
person
who
likes
to
try
new
beers
but
when
i
handed
him
this
i
found
him
coming
back
for
more
next
time
he
was
in
town
d
easy
to
drink
and
unoffensive
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
but
nothing
really
stands
out
either
forgettable
but
not
bad
d
compared
side
by
side
with
3
this
our
is
so
much
better
more
flavorful
and
with
a
light
hop
kick
md
mediumlight
and
refreshing
as
hell
not
too
familiar
with
dortmunder
lagers
but
this
did
not
seem
too
far
away
from
a
standard
budwesier
in
many
ways
again
not
bad
for
the
money
but
probably
would
skip
buying
again
might
be
worth
trying
d
very
light
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
not
a
particularly
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
just
another
simple
european
lager
similar
to
the
5
except
with
a
dialed
down
sweetness
d
for
a
dortmunderexport
lager
its
not
really
anything
special
but
if
you
call
it
an
american
macro
its
a
decent
beer
and
for
the
cheap
price
tag
its
not
bad
as
well
try
if
you
want
something
new
a
nice
beer
overall
maybe
my
favorite
from
the
bunch
known
as
baltika
good
clean
crisp
solidk
beer
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
from
russia
cheap
for
an
imported
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
for
the
price
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
im
thinking
this
beer
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
i
guess
if
i
drank
everything
else
in
the
room
and
the
ruskie
was
all
that
was
left
i
would
say
slainte
since
there
is
no
cheers
in
russian
and
bottoms
up
spasibo
thirstquenching
refreshing
easytodrink
with
a
nice
taste
i
could
easily
session
this
one
of
the
better
export
lagers
out
there
imo
im
guessing
this
is
russias
version
of
miller
light
or
budweiser
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
which
seemed
much
more
fitting
for
this
than
it
did
for
the
other
baltikas
that
ive
tried
anyway
it
had
a
pretty
mild
flavor
and
watery
texture
it
had
a
generic
but
mostly
clean
taste
theres
not
much
more
to
really
say
about
this
overall
it
was
better
than
a
budweiser
but
it
was
still
pretty
boring
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
mild
hops
and
not
much
else
i
can
say
except
that
it
was
very
smooth
with
no
offputting
qualities
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
a
bit
creamy
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
could
easily
have
a
session
with
these
and
they
went
down
very
smooth
got
the
minikeg
offering
not
bad
taste
just
not
much
taste
at
all
a
little
bit
of
corn
maybe
looks
suprisingly
good
refreshing
but
no
real
taste
very
thin
mouthfeel
very
well
priced
given
the
serving
offering
but
nothing
too
special
i
would
probably
by
overe
most
common
macros
for
the
price
this
isnt
an
instant
favorite
of
mine
but
it
is
still
a
decent
beer
its
just
another
typical
export
lager
d
a
very
simple
and
drinkable
brew
nothing
special
going
on
here
seems
like
a
fairly
run
of
the
mill
german
pils
imo
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problems
might
be
nice
with
lighter
foods
a
big
foamy
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
a
nice
golden
lager
impressive
that
it
still
retains
a
132
inch
head
throughout
drinking
it
a
very
clean
crisp
taste
with
a
nice
dry
finish
another
brew
from
russia
this
one
pours
a
pale
yellow
w
fluffy
white
head
which
dissapates
quickly
good
lacing
slight
hop
aroma
some
underlying
ricey
kinda
smell
very
watered
down
tasting
slight
hop
bitterness
light
macrorice
syrup
type
flavor
maybe
a
little
better
grainrice
ratio
than
a
us
beer
tho
again
very
thin
light
watery
body
thirst
quenceing
could
possibly
drink
a
few
on
a
warm
fall
day
green
bottle
notwithstanding
this
was
a
refreshing
and
tasty
pale
lager
a
pleasant
surprise
drinkability
is
just
so
so
nothing
to
really
recommend
here
to
be
honest
the
only
reason
to
try
this
is
if
you
are
trying
to
try
all
the
baltika
beers
some
of
the
baltikas
are
winners
like
6
and
8
and
some
are
turkeys
like
this
one
the
beer
poured
a
light
pale
gold
the
head
was
white
and
quickly
went
from
rocky
to
a
lace
the
aroma
was
of
sour
malt
and
beer
the
taste
was
of
sour
malt
with
some
light
hops
and
a
citrus
finish
the
feel
was
light
and
dry
not
a
bad
export
no
bitterness
and
not
overly
hopped
export
beers
are
meant
to
age
a
little
while
which
should
explain
why
this
beer
is
so
much
better
than
the
other
baltikas
that
find
themselves
halfway
across
the
world
in
the
mid
west
though
nothing
special
thats
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
id
love
to
get
a
chance
to
try
it
fresh
better
tasting
than
a
domestic
lager
and
much
more
enjoyable
another
beer
from
the
baltika
challenge
we
held
this
one
wasnt
one
of
the
better
ones
poured
with
a
totally
white
head
and
a
straw
colored
body
malt
and
corn
and
ethanol
odor
like
a
stinky
old
malt
liquor
taste
is
bitter
astringent
and
dry
im
thinking
amstel
its
funny
because
vlad
the
russian
we
were
drinking
with
said
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
version
of
3
that
they
export
out
to
everywhere
else
why
do
they
think
nonrussians
want
to
drink
a
shittier
version
of
3
eh
thin
and
not
a
good
drinkin
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
slight
white
head
nose
is
surprise
grainy
corn
slight
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
mustiness
taste
is
mild
old
malts
and
grains
not
too
interesting
but
not
offensive
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
soso
overall
its
just
a
bit
boring
adam
drinkability

im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
seemed
right
on
the
mark
pours
a
five
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
traces
of
lace
chrystal
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
skunky
nose
starts
sort
of
sweet
cornygrainy
not
much
flavor
easy
enough
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
im
glad
i
bought
only
one
1
95
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
not
recommended
in
any
way
other
than
the
exceptional
8
wheat
and
the
very
good
4
porter
most
of
the
beer
from
this
brewery
is
merely
above
average
thats
pretty
much
where
7
settles
out
as
well
in
a
region
of
the
world
where
good
beer
is
pretty
hard
to
come
by
thats
nothing
to
sneeze
at
d
this
light
lager
has
some
nice
qualities
but
the
carbonation
really
dominates
the
beer
it
does
enhance
the
hops
a
bit
and
i
would
drink
this
over
soda
pop
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
easy
drinking
but
also
easy
to
forget
ive
certainally
had
worse
purchased
a
bomber
unfortunately
it
is
in
a
green
bottle
it
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
mild
as
is
the
taste
not
bad
compared
to
a
typical
euro
lager
nothing
special
but
drinks
fairly
well
i
would
drink
this
again
but
not
worth
looking
for
clear
wet
straw
gold
with
a
34
inch
white
head
that
didnt
last
more
than
a
minute
or
so
leaving
a
small
thin
table
and
some
bubbles
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
hay
with
a
clean
malt
base
a
bit
boring
taste
is
sweet
with
a
mild
but
not
too
important
bitterness
that
is
quickly
overwhelmed
by
a
sweet
finish
the
body
is
light
and
while
this
is
drinkable
enough
it
isnt
anything
special
im
not
sure
if
its
the
style
or
the
beer
but
it
isnt
my
thing
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
clean
crisp
lager
malt
scent
along
with
german
style
hops
and
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
yet
surprisingly
malty
for
a
lager
it
is
lightly
hopped
and
clean
tasting
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
export
lager
its
light
and
easy
drinking
with
a
maltier
approach

a
fairly
simple

and
refreshing
brew
opinion
on
the
scale
of
cheaper
adjunct
using
macrobrews
i
would
put
this
one
a
little
higher
not
quite
with
kirin
or
san
miguel
but
still
it
is
an
ok
beer
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
but
i
am
glad
that
i
gave
it
a
shot
the
beer
after
its
extraction
from
the
500ml
green
bottle
resides
in
my
glass
a
luminous
gold
with
a
diminutive
frothy
white
head
that
evaporates
quickly
leaving
a
thin
cover
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
archetypal
lager
sweet
malt
that
is
fresh
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
slightly
sweet
and
the
grain
presence
adequate
but
a
bit
light
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
pleasantly
spicy
as
far
as
the
hops
go
acidity
moderate
and
the
aftertaste
desert
bone
dry
a
passable
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
bb

litle

but
overal
fresh
taste
is
quiet
dry
most
certainly
for
a
dortmunder
and
misses
fullness
bitterness
also
dosed
quiet
low
what
makes
this
one
tasting
watery
as
mouthfeel
is
drinks
easy
but
misses
flavour
this
was
an
excellent
beer
that
can
surprise
most
beer
drinkers
it
was
light
but
full
of
flavor
that
almost
resembled
spaten
a
nice
crisp
taste
allowed
it
to
go
down
easily
and
quench
my
thirst
it
trully
should
be
highly
recommended
as
a
master
of
beer
i
would
say
it
is
at
the
moment
one
of
my
top
25
unfortunately
this
is
packaged
in
a
green
bottle
but
the
price
was
right
at
1
69
for
a
pint
bottle
baltika
7
is
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
carbonation
is
very
good
the
head
is
large
and
ultrawhite
after
uncapping
the
bottle
the
aroma
starts
with
a
quick
whiff
of
skunk
followed
by
a
pleasent
but
generic
grainy
sweetness
found
in
many
euro
pale
lagers
the
taste
is
diffenently
that
of
a
euro
pale
lager
and
not
a
dortmunder
flavor
is
nice
and
sweet
with
a
mild
grainy
taste
the
depth
of
flavor
and
malt
profile
are
way
better
than
the
average
euro
pale
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
good
session
choice
for
those
times
when
you
feel
like
something
tasty
but
want
something
relatively
light
better
than
most
macros
is
all
i
can
say
the
baltika
7
is
really
not
much
different
that
the
other
golden
baltika
beers
in
appearance
aroma
or
taste
the
only
thing
that
seems
to
vary
is
the
strength
it
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
yellow
highlights
and
a
full
and
foamy
brightwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
keeps
a
decent
collar
through
most
of
the
glass
and
even
leaves
some
lace
the
aroma
displays
some
semigrainy
malt
with
a
light
sweetness
the
body
is
medium
with
a
soft
carbonation
that
helps
to
give
the
impression
of
a
fuller
body
than
actually
exists
the
flavor
is
as
the
nose
suggests
with
an
adjunct
laden
but
still
mildly
grainy
maltiness
the
bitterness
is
restrained
and
it
finishes
with
some
gently
lingering
sweetness
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
i
want
an
overly
sweet
adjunct
lager
i
think
ill
just
stay
domestic
and
have
a
pabst
blue
ribbon
well
its
definitely
a
special
export
meaning
kind
of
bland
and
very
pale
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
very
pale
and
full
of
adjuncts
interesting
that
in
russia
they
are
required
to
list
the
ingredients
on
beer
cans
i
found
myself
playing
a
game
of
seeing
how
far
down
the
list
i
could
go
before
encountering
the
word
sugar
the
on
tap
version
of
this
beer
comes
out
closer
to
golden
than
the
canned
rendition
the
head
is
also
much
more
substantial
almost
up
to
average
interestingly
the
malt
smell
from
the
can
is
much
weaker
on
tap
hardly
noticeable
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
all
bubbly
like
a
coke
the
malts
are
definitely
present
but
im
still
looking
for
some
hops
there
was
no
finish
and
no
aftertaste
yeah
its
drinkable
but
ill
always
ask
the
bartender
what
else
is
on
tap
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
bordering
on
pale
amber
producing
a
finger
of
frothy
offwhite

head
that
leaves

i
read
that
this
style
of
beer
works
well
with
shellfish
and
am
happy
to
report
this
is
true
a
little
slippery
nice
foam
could
drink
lots
it
looks
and
smells
like
a
refreshing
light
beer
it
tastes
about
how
you
would
expect
with
a
light
very
slightly
hoppy
taste
it
is
not
overly
strong
but
a
smooth
beer
it
has
a
good
after
taste
its
got
a
nice
dark
golden
color
and
it
pours
a
decent
head
you
can
see
it
bubbling
up
and
its
a
got
a
great
lager
taste
not
too
strong
but
definitely
not
too
weak
its
not
a
heavy
beer
its
light
enough
whereby
two
guys
can
make
a
pretty
good
dent
in
a
16
keg
during
a
three
and
a
half
hour
game
good
showing
delaware
ive
tasted
airplane
peanuts
more
flavorful
than
this
it
has
a
generally
comparable
color
and
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
fail
to
exceed
the
expectations
set
by
mainstream
breweries
let
alone
craft
shops
not
sure
how
mature
dominion
brewery
is
but
they
have
potential
despite
my
opinion
of
this
particular
brew

is

is

after
the

overall
this
is
a
very
good
dortmunder
style
good
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
very
drinkable
with
a
good
flavor
i
think
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
its
a
great
take
on
export
lager
overall
as
dortmunders
go
a
solid
offeringcouples
with
chips
well
and
yet
could
stand
alone
for
a
night
of
socializing
as
well
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
malty
beers
well
done
but
this
one
is
fairly
nice
the
grass
tones
are
a
bit
high
and
the
carbonation
could
ease
up
on
my
tongue
and
mouth
but
the
flavor
profile
is
consistent
and
hearty
i
suppose
that
hearty
aspect
may
be
the
pitfall
for
some
but
i
can
appreciate
it
a
nice
sample
of
the
style
nothing
overpowering
at
all
but
a
joy
to
drink
very
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
id
destroy
3
or
4
of
these
easily
after
mowing
the
lawn
an
above
average
lager
but
pretty
boring
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
some
pretty
good
carbonation
lots
of
bubbles
ascending
in
the
glass
inviting
faint
biscuity
aroma
taste
is
light
to
medium
bodied
taste
is
bready
with
a
touch
of
hops
nice
clean
finish
pretty
good
mouthfeel
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
with
no
frills
wont
knock
you
over
with
anything
unique
but
a
nice
simple
good
beer
fitting
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
very
drinkable
well
suited
for
a
refreshing
cool
one
after
a
hot
day
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
super
fancy
but
its
a
decent
flavored
lager
o
slightly
above
average
lager
not
a
bad
try
for
european
lager
by
american
brewery
i
would
recommend
it
d
overall
a
nice
drinking
lager
from
o
d
flavor
and
aroma
is
pretty
close
to
what
i
enjoy
in
a
dortmund
worth
grabbing
a
six
pack
if
you
feel
like
some
good
light
craft
beer
o
a
great
lager
i
will
be
planning
on
having
a
lot
of
this
during
the
summer
a
light
dry
caramel
aftertaste
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
with
a
food
pairing
that
would
bring
out
the
best
in
each
other
i
think
i
would
really
enjoy
this
beer
with
a
meal
old
dominion
has
a
nook
in
terminal
a
of
the
dulles
airport
so
i
certainly
had
to
take
advantage
they
had
the
lager
ale
stout
and
pale
ale
on
tap
i
started
with
the
lager
it
is
clear
with
a
nice

the

i
do
not

the

used
to
make
the

it

the

there
is
a
swath
of

then
it
becomes
bitter
on

after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
follows
the
line
of
becks
d
wow
if
this
is
what
a
dortmunder
is
then
sign
me
up
as
a
lager
alone
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
yet
quaffable
ones
ive
ever
encountered
recommended
o
this
is
a
classic
dortmunder
and
if
youve
never
had
one
you
must
try
it
d
an
easy
drinking
lager
that
goes
down
quickly
and
was
an
inoffensive
pairing
with
corned
beef
hash
i
had
another
pint
in
the

sitting
so
that
says
something
i
think
if
only
they
could
have
done
something
with
that

d
not
something
i
would
buy
but
defiantly
not
something
i
would
turn

this
beer

pretty
much
in
the
same
boat
as
boston
lager
hoppy
grainy

d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
session
beer
that
has
great
flavor
and
feel
to
it
and
a
modest
amount
of
alcohol
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
12
inch
white
head
very
fizzy
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
very
grainy
but
also
with
some
hops
in
the
presence
and
noticable
carmel
malt
a
little
bit
too
watery
for
my
liking
the
mouthfeel
is
normal
and
its
pretty
drinkable
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
and
a
white
head
the
nose
is
slightly
hoppy
and
floral
with
some
grain
taste
brigs
slight
bitterness
and
some
straw
and
grain
feel
is
light
and
crisp
leading
to
good
drinkability
this
is
almost
the
last
of
the
single
new
beers
i
brought
home
with
me
from
nova
it
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
amber
topped
by
only
an
intimation
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
apparently
missing
theres
nothing
there
i
dont
really
know
what
to
say
here
the
taste
comprises
caramel
lemon
zest
coriander
flowers
lemongrass
and
some
light
biscuits
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
crisp
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
close
to
special
but
definitely
drinkable
d
for
the
style
very
nice
i
see
why
it
is
ranked
so
high
on
ba
in
the
dortmunderexport
lager
category
crisp
and
clean
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
but
the
malts
had
a
nice
lively
character
a
bit
less
depth
than
average
but
certainly
refreshing
perhaps
offering
not
quite
enough
to
be
a
session
candidate
credit
given
however
for
the
lively
and
crisp
nature
d
not
bad
for
a
lager
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
great
for
a
hot
day
thanks
to
mr
miller
for
this
bottle
pours
a
deep
straw
with
massive
white
head
settles
with
some
light
lacing
basic
malty
nose
with
hints
of
what
seem
to
be
rice
corn
nothing
enormous
not
bad
the
taste
is
much
bigger
with
no
real
sweetness
as
i
feared
from
the
nose
but
rather
an
upfront
dry
light
hop
bitterness
refreshing
crisp
mouthfeel
keeps
this
drinkable
wish
it
had
more
of
a
finish
nothing
too
complex
but
not
simple
and
mundane
as
any
typical
macro
dont
get
me
wrong
this
doesnt
pack
the
flavor
punch
of
an
imperial
stout
or
iipa
but
damn
tasty
for
a
lager
it
is
not
commonly
available
in
my
area
but
when
i
can
i
would
be
proud
to
hoist
an
od
lager
this
is
a
very
solid
lager
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
foamy
head
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
robust
and
malty
taste
slight
slight
hint
of
fruit
dry
finish
could
easily
have
2
or
3
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
feel
very
satisfied
would
go
great
with
a
burger
steak
or
stew
a
very
drinkable
a
flavorful
lager
its
well
balanced
between
he
grassy
malt
and
bitter
hop
flavors
it
might
be
one
of
the
best
lagers
i
have
had
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
pale
orange
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
bready
with
a
few
herbal
lemon
notes
the
flavor
is
bready
and
light
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
easy
on
the
palate
d
very
drinkable
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
a
decent
lager
the
fruity
notes
are
very
appealing
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
old
dominion
is
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
and
very
underrated
brewery
this
is
one
of
their
best
beers
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
my
first
of
this
style
lager
very
nice
and
could
drink
all
night
poured
from
the
tap
to
a
light
orangeyellow
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
nose
and
taste
were
both
dominated
by
grain
to
the
point
that
little
else
was
noticed
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
slightly
tingly
and
the
finish
was
short
and
dry
not
too
much
to
this
one
drinkability
is
high
at
first
i
thought
it
was
very
simple
but
more
flavor
came
out
as
it
warmed
a
good
lager
i
want
to
try
it
again
my
first
dortmunderexport
lager
a
fairly
drinkable
crisp
brew
light
bodied
but
not
light
in
flavor
prickly
carbonation
the
aroma
is
like
a
sour
mash
made
with
corn
and
herbal
hops
the
appearance
is
cloudy
gold
with
a
small
but
nice
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
not
quite
as
sour
the
palate
is
smooth
and
the
finish
malty
with
pepper
and
citrus
notes
overall
i
like
it
but
it
has
a
strange
pickle
sourness
to
the
aroma
this
one
suffers
by
being
the
final
style
in
my
rack
pack
compared
to
the
ale
or
pale
ale
this
one
is
rather
onedimensional
wan
yellow
in
the
glass
though
the
foam
head
was
impressive
thinner
clearer
and
a
bit
sparkling
with
a
slight
malty
presence
in
the
nose
taste
was
interesting
but
the
interest
didnt
last
a
nice
malty
beer
flavor
balanced
with
a
hops
bitterness
that
began
to
overpower
the
flavor
toward
the
end
lost
a
few
points
on
drinkability
for
that
though
i
havent
seen
it
on
tap
lately
the
vienna
lager
is
a
better
lighter
color
beer
than
this
one
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
odd
in
its
own
way
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
dortmunder
like
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
got
a
sixer
from
a
friend
who
went
on
vacation
and
it
left
me
wishing
it
was
available
in
my
area
nice
and
hoppy
this
one
is
something
you
should
check
out
if
given
the
chance
overall
served
its
purpose
the
taste
is
not
as
great
but
still
good
its
light
but
flavourful
with
apples
bread
dough
slightly
yeasty
herbs
with
more
herbs
and
some
lemon
pulp
in
the
finish
fairly
fullbodied
yet
crisp
it
is
very
clean
with
light
sweetness
followed
by
light
but
dominant
lively
bitterness
and
hop
flavours
lasting
through
the
finish
it
soon
becomes
a
little
bland
and
dulled
but
retains
its
basic
solid
characteristics
and
is
highly
drinkable
pours
a
very
light
gold
in
color
with
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
very
vegetal
and
corn
like
really
cant
get
past
the
smell
of
this
beer
ive
had
other
offerings
from
dominion
and
theyve
been
decent
taste
is
vey
lager
like
emphasing
in
corn
plenty
of
carbonation
and
bad
smell
to
go
around
not
good
d
highly
drinkable
i
dont
drink
many
lagers
but
this
is
one
id
go
to
again
and
would
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
people
becoming
interested
in
craft
beer
brewed
on
52708
d
certainly
very
drinkable
a
nice
overall
offering
a
bit
of
complexity
and
on
the
refreshing
side
pale
yellow
colored
lager
with
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
a
lemony
citrus
smell
taste
is
citrus
with
a
metallic
finish
this
is
a
pretty
boring
bland
beer
i
probably
would
not
recommend
this
even
though
its
not
terrible
i
personally
will
not
seek
outone
is
enough
thank
you
good
middle
of
saturday
beer
10242004
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
although
id
say
its
pretty
much
average
across
the
board
bright
goldenyellow
colored
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
malty
and
a
touch
grassy
taste
is
sweeter
than
a
lot
of
lagers
ive
had
pretty
smooth
and
refreshing
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
sudsy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
wispy
layer
smells
of
toasty
biscuity
malt
with
a
touch
of
clover
and
honey
very
flavorful
with
a
nice
biscuity
base
some
sweetness
on
top
and
a
touch
of
nuttiness
dry
grassy
flavor
and
a
note
of
lemon
zest
add
to
the
overall
taste
drinks
nicely
with
a
lighter
medium
body
and
some
good
carbonation
smooth
with
a
slick
coating
on
the
finish
goes
down
easy
with
some
great
flavor
this
beer
was
a
delightful
surprise
the
lovely
golden
amber
color
is
accentuated
by
a
slight
but
lasting
head
that
laces
well
down
the
glass
a
very
pleasant
nose
greets
you
as
you
begin
to
drink
and
this
maltiness
follows
through
to
the
palate
expressing
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
that
is
enough
to
stimulate
you
without
overriding
the
refreshing
drinkable
character
theres
a
mild
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
the
bottling
date
is
stamped
on
each
bottle
to
ensure
that
buyers
are
aware
of
freshness
i
picked
mine
up
in
a
delta
airlines
crown
room
club
at
the
washington
dc
reagan
national
airport
nice
selection
delta
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
sessionable
and
a
step
up
from
the
big
boys
but
nothing
special
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
by
any
means
m
d
clean
with
a
crispness
and
a
great
dry
finish
perhaps
just
a
tiny
bit
stronger
than
id
go
with
as
a
session
brew
but
just
fine
for
a
few
on
the
patio
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
if
not
a
classic
of
the
genre
decent
flavor
profile
as
well
bready
and
toasty
and
grainy
good
bit
of
toffee
as
well
this
wasnt
too
bad
i
enjoyed
this
but
am
not
sure
i
will
purchase
again
worth
a
shot
in
the
end
fairly
drinkable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
i
live
right
near
this
brewery
and
ive
avoided
drinking
it
for
years
with
fear
that
id
be
disappointed
stupid
me
drinkability
is
great
and
i
could
down
quite
a
few
of
these
malt
dominates
this
beer
and
thats
a
good
thing
it
works
i
believe
this
is
my
first
try
of
this
style
and
i
like
it
looking
forward
to
trying
others
in
this
category

bitterness
a
bit

very
refreshing

drink
smooth

balanced
good
session
lager
pours
a
clear
medium
light
straw
color
with
a
nice
cloudy
white
head
aromas
start
out
with
what
i
perceive
to
be
a
lot
of
diacetyl
but
it
soon
dissipates
a
very
light
malt
note
follows
with
a
slight
spicy
hop
note
but
the
butter
lingers
on
the
palate
a
medium
low
bodied
lager
delivers
a
balanced
malt
and
hop
flavor
neither
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
dry
with
a
very
crisp
dry
finish
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
expect
for
a
dortmunder
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
d
pretty
sweet
but
in
line
with
the
dortmunder
style
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
nice
complex
aroma
and
flavor
profile
pours
goldenstraw
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
strong
buttery
aroma
toffee
and
caramel
malt
flavor
some
breadiness
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
rich
quite
carbonated
a
good
example
of
the
dortmunder
style
hopefully
this
will
survive
the
changes
at
the
brewery
its
a
beer
my
noncraft
drinking
friends
enjoy
drinkability
a
good
version
of
a
dortmunder
a
refreshing
drink
on
a
hot
summer
night
not
a
bad
allaround
beer
ive
had
many
others
that
are
similar
in
style
but
taste
alot
worse
than
this
i
could
probably
drink
many
of
these
and
be
much
more
satisfied
than
any
macro
worth
drinking
for
sure
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
and
id
have
it
again
if
it
were
my
best
option
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
a
very
sweet
and
grainy
beer
with
not
much
to
show
as
far
as
complexity
however
its
a
very
drinkable
and
clean
lager
perfect
for
the
summer
sweet
i
love
finding
a
decent
craft
lager
this
stacks
up
with
the
other
fine
exports
ive
tried
theres
a
creamy
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
crisp
hops
and
a
mellow
lingers
bitterness
yummy
i
would
appreciate
a
touch
more
malt
flavor
but
theres
no
hint
of
adjunct
or
anything
nasty
just
a
tasty
lager
to
enjoy
very
easy
going
down
paired
weel
with
my
seasoned
steak
wrap
overall
a
tasty
lager
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
yellow
in
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
offwhite
foam
smells
of
bready
yeast
and
light
hops
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
grains
and
crisp
understated
hops
medium
in
both
body
and
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
in
this
style
that
id
reach
for
first
pours
a
clear
lighter
amber
with
a
suprising
light
fluffy
head
capping
the
pint
nose
is
very
malty
flavor
profile
continues
with
the
lightly
roasted
malt
notes
some
faint
fruit
and
sweetness
it
was
smooth
but
not
all
that
much
happening
here
this
was
ok
not
offensive
but
not
enough
to
make
you
want
a
2nd
thanks
to
dherling
for
this
one
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
mild
but
pleasant
like
a
sweeter
version
of
your
typical
american
lager
taste
is
pleasantly
full
and
robust
for
the
style
very
tasty
grains
with
hints
of
carmel
malts
citrusy
hops
and
spices
feels
great
drinking
it
and
is
highly
sessionable
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
it
would
be
a
regular
great
version
of
the
style
d
a
good
session
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
nice
summer
evening
there
was
little
aroma
but
i
detected
some
sweet
smell
maybe
citrus
if
you
view
the
info
on
this
beer
its
got
a
lot
put
into
it
but
seems
to
result
in
a
prett
mellow
brew
this
could
just
be
me
but
the
tatse
seemed
rather
unremarkable
it
was
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
it
just
seemed
slightly
above
par
or
avg
to
me
the
taste
for
me
was
light
plane
and
maybe
a
little
sweet
very
little
if
any
hopor
bitterness
i
understand
that
a
lager
is
not
mean
to
be
hopped
up
and
super
bitter
but
i
just
feel
the
lager
fell
a
bit
flat
and
maybe
could
have
more
depth
of
flavor
worth
a
try
but
nothing
remarkable
overall
impression
not
a
bad
lager
certainly
drinkable
and
interesting
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
the
beer
had
a
tangerineorange
hue
with
gold
highlights
and
a
bit
of
haziness
to
it
it
had
a
miniature
head
of
small
white
bubbles
that
just
fizzled
away
in
a
matter
of
only
a
few
seconds
it
just
left
a
spatter
of
white
bubbly
lace
and
rings
if
you
put
your
ear
to
it
it
sounds
a
lot
like
rice
krispies
you
can
hear
snap
crackle
and
pop
it
barely
had
an
aroma
to
it
the
aroma
was
just
toasted
malt
hops
sweet
butter
and
with
a
hint
of
citrus
fruits
the
first
taste
i
received
from
this
beer
was
butter
i
thought
the
first
taste
was
going
to
be
malt
but
not
this
lager
after
the
butter
comes
a
pinch
of
toasted
malt
and
just
a
slight
snap
of
citrus
hops
at
the
end
i
didnt
know
old
dominion
was
buttering
up
their
beer
i
guess
they
had
some
butter
lying
around
the
brewery
and
decided
to
put
it
in
the
beer
to
make
it
taste
like
youre
eating
popcorn
at
the
movie
theater
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
just
had
a
small
aftertaste
of
citrus
fruits
without
the
butter
taste
it
would
have
risen
this
beer
to
an
average
run
of
the
mill
lager
beer
that
would
have
been
ok
to
drink
but
with
it
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
too
much
butter
and
not
enough
malt
or
any
other
decent
flavors
recommended
if
this
was
a
blind
test
id
assume
this
was
from
western
germany
very
good
export
styles
are
fairly
rare
to
see
especially
from
a
us
brewery
and
these
guys
do
it
very
well
i
could
drink
this
often
especially
at
the
end
of
summer
draft
at
green
leafe
williamsburg
va
this
is
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
veil
of
foam
lightly
hoppy
but
not
much
of
a
bite
smooth
and
evenly
malty
mostly
this
is
a
well
done
light
lager
an
awesome
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
session
lager

generally
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
bigger
lager
the
diacetyl
was
a
bit
disturbing
early
but
overall
found
a
nice
hopmalt
balance
but
neither
was
robust
enough
to
make
this
as
good
as
better
examples
of
the
style
like
dab
a
nice
session
brew
thanks
to
a
friend
of
mine
for
bringing
me
a
sixpack
of
this
from
virginia
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
i
could
see
getting
this
to
accompany
a
ballgame
or
as
a
thirstquencher
on
a
hot
day
or
to
accompany
chicken
wings
or
the
like
the
drinkability
is
ave
nothing
of
interest
here
mk
ov
drinkable
but
slight
off
flavors
detract
somewhat
upsetting
due
to
near
flawless
presentation
i
just
wish
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
about
this
one
the
metal
taste
and
the
way
i
just
never
got
into
it
really
didnt
help
it
drinkability
yup
sessionable
more
alcohol
in
here
than
i
expected
but
didnt
seem
to
stop
me
from
enjoying
a
few
drinkable
sessionable
summer
beer
on
a
90
degree
day
interesting
malt
character
as
a
dortmunder
effort
makes
it
a
treat
among
all
the
other
straight
lemon
zest
summer
offerings
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
lager
for
the
summer
months
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
nose
was
a
muted
malt
and
not
much
else
taste
is
a
blend
of
refreshing
malts
and
comes
thru
with
a
hint
of
hops
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
refreshing
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
brew
that
would
totally
hit
the
spot
after
a
round
a
golf
or
after
cutting
the
grass
because
of
the
refreshing
factor
drinkability
stellar
drinkability
this
is
a
best
of
dortmunder
lager
im
telling
you
deasy
drinking
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
and
they
were
wonderful
with
the
steak
i
cooked
for
dinner
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderfully
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
munich
and
carapils
malts
it
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
bisquity
feel
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
is
light
but
well
rounded
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
residual
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
lager
its
full
flavored
and
easy
drinking
a
fine
session
beer
drinkability
consumption
is
rather
easy
yet
taste
is
lackluster
nothing
about
this
beer
leaves
me
craving
another
but
all
the
same
nothing
deters
me
drinkability
notes
extremely
drinkable
very
light
and
refreshing
could
drink
em
till
silly
had
a
22oz
draft
of
this
at
my
favorite
watering
hole
it
pours
a
light
and
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
it
has
a
standard
light
lager
smell
with
a
bit
of
fruity
overtones
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
sharp
fizzyness
the
taste
is
clean
slightly
hoppy
with
a
lasting
light
hoppy
aftertaste
i
wasnt
too
surprise
to
learn
later
that
this
was
a
dortmunder
style
lager
i
seem
to
enjoy
the
dortmunder
and
imperial
pilsners
the
most
of
the
pilsnerish
or
light
lagers
the
taste
is
simply
one
of
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
lighter
malt
is
balanced
well
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
and
the
astringent
of
the
lagering
theres
a
slight
sense
of
malt
huskiness
but
seems
to
fit
all
in
all
nearly
perfect
for
the
style
and
amazingly
drinkable
i
put
it
right
up
there
with
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
old
dominion
brews
some
outstanding
beer
as
i
was
reminded
of
while
briefly
reading
some
of
my
reviews
this
one
is
excellent
and
is
impressively
drinkable
as
well
its
enjoyability
is
attributable
first
and
foremost
to
the
brewing
skill
of
its
creators
if
i
lived
in
virginia
id
drink
a
whole
lot
of
dominion
lager
overall
a
mediorce
lager
slighty
watery
with
a
decent
malt
taste
every
4th
sip
wont
purchase
again
i
would
drink
if
there
werent
other
options
though
ontap
at
the
barking
dog
good
tasting
lager
but
minimal
complexity
or
distinctness
its
got
a
mediumbrown
color
with
little
head
i
faintly
smell
caramel
along
with
some
roasted
character
the
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
slight
oak
character
this
brew
is
moderately
hopped
and
thats
what
i
taste
after
each
sip
again
not
complex
or
unique
but
the
taste
is
not
discouraging
and
fairs
well
as
an
average
or
slightly
above
average
lager
a
few
of
these
can
be
had
because
of
its
mild
attributes
i
noticed
that
it
formed
a
nice
head
it
was
well
carbonated
but
not
fizzy
there
was
a
bright
golden
to
yellow
hue
the
body
of
the
beer
is
relatively
light
the
aroma
has
a
grassy
straw
quality
i
noticed
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
character
in
the
nose
this
is
enticing
to
a
beer
drinker
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
gentle
the
light
body
gives
it
a
good
drinkability
this
is
a
good
session
beer
you
can
take
this
beer
to
a
picnic
or
bbq
it
works
perfectly
well
in
situations
when
you
will
drink
more
than
one
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
emphasis
in
this
beer
that
is
typical
of
german
and
german
style
beers
this
malt
character
gives
dominion
lager
a
slightly
sweet
flavor
a
beer
that
could
get
unfairly
overlooked
as
some
find
the
style
unexciting
or
overshadowed
by
its
big
brother
in
the
old
dominion
line
tupers
hot
pocket
pils
this
would
make
a
fine
beer
to
serve
at
a
gathering
of
macro
drinkers
and
beer
geeks
the
beer
poured
a
nice
gold
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
sour
malt
the
taste
was
of
sour
malt
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
feel
was
light
and
slightly
oily
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
went
in
to
find
something
reasonably
priced
for
july
4th
and
how
could
i
pass
up
what
should
be
a
decent
beer
at
9
00
a
12
pack
what
i
got
was
a
fresh
case
of
beer
that
is
probably
the
ideal
american
lager
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
is
certainly
a
good
beer
to
open
the
door
for
those
who
havent
tried
anything
other
than
a
macro
pours
light
golden
slightly
cloudy
very
little
head
the
scent
is
mostly
the
malts
while
with
the
taste
you
get
a
nice
blend
of
the
multiple
hops
and
malts
many
of
the
ingredients
and
a
description
is
on
the
bottle
which
is
nice
hops
are
quite
floral
and
refreshing
overall
a
good
lager
dominion
has
made
another
good
beer
12
oz
bottled
on
oct
1
2004
with
a
blurb
about
the
beer
on
the
back
label
brewed
with
4
different
malts
and
5
hop
varieties
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
is
a
pale
gold
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
half
inch
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
lots
of
diacetyl
butterbutterscotch
caramel
and
a
nice
hop
aroma
floral
diacetyl
is
also
big
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
that
lingers
and
a
hint
of
metal
the
flavor
is
substantial
and
the
malt
notes
remind
me
of
a
brown
ale
no
hop
flavors
stand
out
but
you
can
tell
theres
a
good
amount
in
there
it
is
crisp
at
first
but
becomes
very
smooth
one
of
the
tastiest
lightcolored
lagers
ive
ever
had
not
experienced
with
the
dortmunderexport
style
this
beer
medium
brown
with
a
firm
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
and
a
malty
aroma
sweet
more
sweet
not
cloying
pretty
full
mouthfeel
sweet
and
citrusy
finish
but
i
didnt
get
the
hoppy
bite
that
others
have
reported
this
is
an
easy
drinker
good
beer
to
introduce
to
a
regular
macro
drinker
sampled
this
one
a
few
minutes
after
finishing
a
brooklyn
lager
not
really
fair
to
compare
the
two
as
they
are
completely
different
styles
of
lagers
old
dominion
is
a
dortmunder
export
very
similar
in
character
to
the
the
excellent
great
lakes
version
this
pours
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
healthy
vanilla
white
head
that
is
mediumsized
the
head
hangs
around
quite
a
bit
and
leaves
a
moderate
dose
of
patch
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
has
lots
of
floral
hoppiness
with
an
undertone
of
grainy
malt
a
hint
of
clover
honey
caps
the
bouquet
mouthfeel
is
underwhelming
but
decent
enough
with
light
to
medium
body
and
adequate
carbonation
the
taste
is
quite
good
assertive
floral
and
herbal
hops
are
augmented
by
some
sour
lemon
malt
presence
balances
well
with
a
touch
of
soda
cracker
and
clover
honey
fruity
pear
notes
appear
midway
well
balanced
finish
with
mild
citric
bitterness
complex
for
a
lager
but
this
is
a
well
rendered
version
of
the
dortmunder
style
which
in
my
opinion
puts
classic
american
lagers
to
shame
excellent
drinkability
one
of
the
better
american
lagers
youre
going
to
find
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
carbonated
with
a
medium
light
body
it
is
a
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
beer
while
it
wont
win
any
prizes
or
contend
for
the
best
lager
youve
ever
had
i
dont
have
any
complaints
pale
gold
to
golden
in
color
it
has
an
appealing
appearance
full
bodied
taste
and
pleasing
aroma
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
beats
the
pants
off
of
similar
more
available
beers
i
make
sure
to
have
one
when
i
am
in
the
area
of
the
brew
pub
received
from
manekineko
thanks
12
oz
bottle
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
the
brew
pours
a
light
yellow
color
and
a
small
bleached
white
head
foams
up
and
fades
to
an
edge
layer
rather
quickly
aroma
is
grainy
husky
malt
with
some
caramel
and
not
much
else
rather
mild
on
the
nose
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
and
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
malt
up
front
and
some
husk
again
i
get
a
bit
of
fruitiness
developing
as
the
beer
warms
light
apricots
the
beer
is
nice
and
crisp
and
refreshing
very
clean
finish
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
the
fruity
flavors
were
just
a
little
more
robust
and
the
aroma
was
more
pronounced
had
a
few
of
these
on
tap
in
arlington
recently
i
found
it
to
be
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
a
fine
accompaniment
to
a
varied
dinner
pasta
filet
shrimp
the
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
is
tremendous
towering
and
longlastingwhite
and
thick
the
aroma
is
notably
yeasty
and
has
gives
the
smell
a
doughy
soft
edge
also
in
the
smell
is
a
little
citrus
and
light
hoppiness
its
not
particularly
sweet
and
is
medium
to
light
in
body
finish
is
clean
crisp
and
hoppy
its
a
wellmade
and
very
enjoyable
brew
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
head
is
creamy
and
slowly
dissipates
there
was
a
perceptible
citrus
aroma
to
this
beer
like
grapefruit
light
hoppy
notes
too
taste
was
of
cirtus
again
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
was
malty
goodness
and
hoppy
bitter
i
felt
i
wanted
just
a
bit
more
body
to
this
beer
but
i
still
liked
it
i
think
the
thing
that
stuck
with
me
the
most
was
the
maltiness
which
i
enjoyed
overall
i
thought
it
balanced
the
malt
and
hops
flavors
nicely
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
and
id
definitely
try
their
other
brews
in
addition
final
thought
this
is
about
the
next
best
thing
to
gl
dortumunder
gold
for
american
micro
export
lagers
this
just
tasted
like
your
average
run
of
the
mill
lager
nothing
special
it
was
just
there
i
guess
the
only
good
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
refreshing
and
kind
of
had
a
maltyhjoppy
hint
to
it
had
no
real
head
to
it
and
was
a
golden
straw
color
had
it
at
the
brewery
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
it
in
bottles
i
think
it
geared
towards
the
folks
who
drink
bud
and
stuff
like
that
appearance
golden
hue
deep
straw
sunshine
honey
tone
with
a
slight
tint
of
amber
going
on
forms
large
chunky
white
frothy
head
leaving
thick
heavy
patches
of
lace
as
the
billowing
head
dwindles
aroma
cereal
grain
sweetness
stands
out
with
a
touch
of
peppery
saaz
and
herbal
noble
hops
great
presence
with
a
honey
like
sweetness
as
well
taste
excellent
export
style
lager
contains
flavorful
layers
of
lightly
toasted
specialty
grains
wow
malt
character
definitely
broadens
as
this
beer
warms
a
bit
light
and

of

very
nice
lager

a
light
goldenamber
color
there
is
almost
no
head
at
all
even
though
i
tried
to
get
one
going
smelled
rather
yeasty
upon
opening
but
once
in
the
class
that
smell
was
gone
a
very
tasty
beer
this
is
highly
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
chilled
the
entire
six
pack
i
thank
my
wife
for
brining
me
some
back
from
va
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
head
and
minimal
lace
forced
carbonation
is
very
lively
aroma
is
clean
and
grainy
with
subtle
delicately
floral
hops
taste
is
again
clean
grainy
malt
with
very
light
hoppyness
there
are
almost
no
fruity
esters
to
speak
of
a
little
citric
tartness
starts
creeping
in
mid
palette
enjoy
this
for
what
it
is
folks
a
simple
clean
sessionable
lager
pretty
similar
in
most
respects
to
samuel
adams
boston
lager
but
a
bit
less
malty
thanks
aragornunplugged
for
this
trade
im
drinking
this
nice
beer
out
of
a
dominion
pint
glass
i
just
bought
at
their
ashburn
va
brewpub
this
weekend
its
a
dark
golden
color
that
had
a
nice
white
head
gone
now
though
im
not
quite
sure
what
niche
this
beer
fills
because
it
wont
help
macrodrinkers
convert
to
micros
but
its
not
really
different
enough
from
a
macro
to
attract
your
average
microdrinker
actually
however
thats
one
of
its
strong
suits
for
me
i
dont
like
bud
and
coors
because
i
know
they
taste
bad
to
me
but
my
palate
is
not
refined
enough
to
taste
all
the
subtleties
in
most
craft
beers
so
their
flavors
are
often
lost
on
me
this
one
has
just
enough
flavor
carbonation
and
body
to
make
me
enjoy
it
and
its
not
even
a
style
i
normally
enjoy

this
post
is
based
on
notes
from
that

medium

malts

not

this
is
a
very
well
balanced

it

taste
was
light
astringent
grains
with
a
small
hop
snap
that
was
a
little
bit
spicy
mouthfeel
was
nice
with
tight
carbonation
good
for
the
style
a
very
drinkable
lager
and
nicely
well
rounded
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
formed
a
foamy
white
head
that
left
some
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
grain
with
a
touch
of
caramel
a
flavor
of
malt
hops
and
caramel
the
finish
was
light
with
some
hint
of
caramel
and
grain
a
nice
lager
but
a
bit
sweet
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
proper
lawnmower
beer
sweetish
honeyapricot
malt
and
slight
graininess
with
a
well
balanced
hoppiness
i
get
mostly
noble
hop
but
there
is
some
citrus
way
in
the
back
good
underlying
bitterness
and
a
slightly
drier
finish
followed
by
a
slightly
sweeter
aftertaste
my
buddy
in
dc
always
has
a
good
supply
of
these
on
hand
and
for
good
reason
its
a
very
drinkable
everyday
brew
homebrewers
take
note
the
brewpub
will
let
you
take
a
jar
of
slurry
home
and
ive
tasted
some
homebrews
using
this
yeast
that
are
very
very
good
overall
a
good
clean
lager
this
isnt
a
style
im
really
into
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
be
glad
to
have
another
not
quite
as
much
character
as
glbcs
dortmunder
gold
but
one
of
the
better
pale
lagers
ive
tried
a
soft
and
malty
refreshing
lager
drinkable
and
subtley
complex
this
lager
pours
a
clear
bright
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
balance
is
the
watchword
for
a
dortmunder
style
lager
and
i
would
say
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
balanced
i
have
tasted
in
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
very
mild
and
all
malt
the
flavor
is
quite
balanced
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
and
a
hop
bite
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
crisp
fresh
beer
that
has
a
surprisingly
medium
nearly
creamy
mouthfeel
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
find
it
quite
drinkable
pours
with
a
good
head
that
goes
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
clear
amber
color
with
more
malt
than
hops
but
the
balance
is
there
this
beer
has
a
crisp
smooth
and
clean
malt
palate
very
different
from
the
big
lagers
like
bud
it
finishes
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hop
but
not
bitter
this
brew
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
very
foamy
white
head
a
light
hoppy
aroma
introduces
a
light
bodied
lager
with
a
floral
hop
presence
and
a
dry
malt
flavor
the
finish
is
clean
a
crisp
altogether
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
goes
down
easily
great
sunday
sports
brew
a
clear
golden
body
is
topped
by
a
short
foamy
brightwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
readily
but
holds
a
decent
collar
and
thin
surface
covering
as
well
as
leaving
some
trace
lace
the
nose
welcomes
you
with
a
firm
expression
of
grainy
malt
dressed
up
by
a
softly
floral
mildly
citrusy
hoppiness
thats
actually
quite
interesting
with
a
soft
touch
of
lemon
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
fine
carbonation
that
caresses
the
tongue
and
then
falls
away
quite
smoothly
the
flavor
is
exactly
as
might
be
expected
a
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
malt
thats
gently
infused
with
floral
softly
citrusy
hop
flavors
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
short
and
dry
a
welldone
refreshing
and
enjoyable
lager
that
could
easily
fit
many
occassions
and
would
make
a
great
crossover
beer
for
the
macro
drinker
it
makes
me
think
of
summer
baseball
and
backyard
bbqs
although
its
just
as
good
on
a
crisp
night
nestled
in
with
a
good
book
or
video
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smell
has
nice
hop
aromas
the
hop
flavor
is
light
but
it
compliments
the
smooth
malt
flavors
of
the
brew
very
well
nice
light
body
and
nicely
smooth
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
will
definitely
go
well
with
the
hot
weather
of
the
summer
old
dominion
lager
is
the
primary
house
brew
i
like
it
on
tapthough
sometimes
it
has
a
slight
sulphurous
aroma
and
after
taste
do
to
overuse
of
the
yeast
one
of
the
original
recipes
at
od
i
believe
was
created
by
john
mallet
former
brewmaster
somewhat
rich
in
flavor
as
a
lager
better
in
cooler
weather
notes
a
topnotch
well
rounded

overall
not

bad

not

great
either
average
beer
all
around
no
desire
to
pick
up
again
had
it
in
an
airport
hotel
inroom
minibar
in
sweden
yes
this
is
a
macrobrew
but
as
some
of
the
other
reviewers
have
stated
its
quite
drinkable
yellow
in
color
a
bit
of
lacing
had
a
sour
smell
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
not
in
a
cloying
easy
wellbalanced
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
quite
refreshing
and
id
happily
drink
it
again
actually
a
plastic
bottle
250
ml
rather
easy
to
drink
if
youre
not
into
hops
and
want
a
rather
sweet
beverage
d
two
words
dont
bother
average
in
all
ways
not
really
good
but
not
bad
either
smells
a
bit
of
corn
all
in
all
nothing
special
nevertheless
i
liked
this
beer
and
it
served
me
well
i
was
still
able
to
drink
much
with
my
friends
when
i
had
a
sore
throat
it
was
very
smooth
in
all
ways
take
it
for
what
it
is
and
enjoy
just
a
typical
beer
to
drink
and
have
a
good
time
d
not
bad
quite
light

one
of
the
better
offerings
of
ikeas
imports
into
great
britain
i
thought
it
tasty
and
drinkable
unable
to
remember
why
now
but
it
was
ok
if
i
am
offered
another
one
day
ill
rereviewe
the
beer
can
thanks
to
milos
for
thisa
sparkling
gold
pour
with
a
fizzy
white
cap
nose
of
corn
and
vegetables
some
wet
paper
grains
and
biscuit
tastes
sweet
of
grassy
hops
grains
and
sweet
veggies
quick
and
assertive
fizzy
finish
sometimes
you
just
need
to
shake
it
like
a
polaroid
picture
i
did
not
like
the
beer
and
would
never
buy
it
again
got
a
can
of
this
onboard
the
train
from
lund
to
stockholm
sweden
had
a
little
head
with
no
lace
color
was
pale
yellow
aroma
was
beery
with
a
little
citrus
flavor
was
common
corn
adjunct
beer
with
a
hint
of
citric
tartness
body
was
average
for
this
kind
of
beer
finish
was
the
same
and
instantly
forgettable
mine
was
only
cool
and
of
course
would
be
better
cold
drinkability
gets
a
3
5
because
i
am
swedish
a
friend
gave
me
a
33cl
can
from
a
recently
trip
to
sweden
poured
in
a
glass
the
brew
presented
a
thick
white
head
that
rapidly
dissipated
with
almost
nonexistent
lacing
nose
was
weakly
malted
color
was
nice
golden
yellow
this
beer
has
excessive
carbonation
this
was
the
one
feature
that
caught
my
attention
about
this
beer
as
i
have
never
seen
a
beer
this
active
before
the
taste
was
dry
which
i
dont
mind
the
beer
is
quite
bitter
initially
but
tones
down
as
the
glasses
end
nears
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
watery
while
i
would
not
turn
down
another
if
offered
i
will
not
seek
out
this
brew
as
many
far
better
lagers
are
available
now
ive
moved
around
a
bit
more
among
the
beers
but
ill
still
say
i
like
this
a
bit
might
be
good
memories
i
dont
know
a
rather
anonymous
lager
dortmunder
or
not
useless
can
a
standard
and
good
tasting
swedish
pilsner
nice
flavour
that
is
dominated
by
malt
and
soft
bitterness
looking
forward
to
the
cristmas
edition
when
is
it
possible
to
get
that
in
systembolageti
need
to
fill
my
stock
till
xmas
another
fun
fact
this
is
the
second
most
sold
beer
in
sweden
after
sofiero
original
sofiero
is
one
of
the
cheapest
ones
at
systembolaget
while
mariestads
is
considered
premium
as
it
costs
5
sek
extra
and
i
actually
understand
why
would
not
buy
it
again
drinkability
well
unlike
most
lagers
this
beer
doesnt
strike
me
as
particularly
sessionable
since
it
ends
up
unpleasant
rather
than
boring
and
generic
so
while
the
malthops
balance
is
on
point
spendrups
managed
to
make
this
beer
completely
unbearable
especially
for
dortmunder
fans
such
as
myself
unremarkable
and
im
being
nice
d
low
to
be
avoided
once
in
the
ikea
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
go
to
the
old
gold
also
from
spendrups
bryggeri
witch
is
at
least
decent
dbetter
than
what
i
expected
im
not
going
to
buy
a
6pack
but
id
drink
it
again
the
carbonation
is
good
and
the
beer
quench
your
thirst
rather
well
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the

station
cafe
poured
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
almost
creamy
texture
and
color
head
and
lace
color
was
a
very
clear
deep
rich
medium
amber
aroma
was
malty
caramel
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
flavor
was
about
the
same
with
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
sweet
overall
body
was
average
nevertheless
not
a
lot
going
on
and
basically
forgettable
pours
a
two

fades
quickly
to
a

notes

the
beer
is
amazingly
shitty
but
it
was
all
they
had
on
the
train
nothing
else
i
can
say
about
it
i
shouldve
assumed
when
something
is
labelled
export
it
translates
to
rubbish
a
lager
with
some
more
diacetyl
than
many
others
i
cannot
really
see
why
this
one
is
selling
so
much
it
might
be
the
lavish
marketing
as
this
is
the
premium
brand
from
spendrups
comes
on
pallate
somewhat
malty
a
reminder
of
what
malt
is
really
makes
this
beer
bad
sweet
sugary
hops
are
in
there
as
well
with
some
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
m
very
refreshing
and
with
some
sensation
of
sweetness
that
is
very
faint
but
present
the
bitterness
is
moderated
as
should
an
adequate
deutsche
lager
but
a
bit
crass
overall
seemingly
lacking
any
nuance
the
label
said
it
was
wurzigmild
cant
argue
with
that
one
of
the
fullest
bodied
lagers
i
have
had
in
awhile
big
fresh
mouthfeel
lots
of
hops
and
a
clean
dry
finish
this
is
the
export
style
at
its
best
bigger
than
a
pils
wonder
why
not
many
people
have
reviewed
this
but
rest
assured
i
will
buy
more
this
spring
drinks
alright
typical
of
the
style
nothing
special
here
overall
a
decent
above
average
helles
its
not
overly
memorable
but
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
refreshing
and
quenching
without
being
offensive
that
sneaky
veg
didnt
prove
to
be
an
issue
after
all
pretty
average
wouldnt
look
for
this
one
again
there
are
better
lagers
available
overall
although
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
dortmunderexporter
i
did
not
see
much
difference
from
any
macro
lager
that
we
can
find
in
a
supermarket
shelf
a
bright
golden
colour
with
a
correct
head
that
disappears
soon
hops
and
floral
aroma
light
bitter
flavour
palate
is
a
light
bitter
some
dryness
sulphury
clean
finish
a
good
correct
beer
very
refreshing
in
summer
but
one
that
you
can
drink
at
any
time
overall
this
beer
was
tasty
enough
and
went
down
quite
smooth
but
it
didnt
have
any
characteristics
that
jumped
out
either
so
its
fairly
middle
of
the
road
in
the
end
poors
a
pretty
standard
clear
gold
under
a
healthy
1
5
finger
white
head
with
some
contour
and
a
bit
of
staying
power
no
lace
the
nose
is
very
mild
with
just
a
touch
of
barley
malt
the
mouth
is
prickly
and
one
shade
heavier
than
light
theres
a
good
bit
of
malt
here
not
quite
sweet
and
very
smooth
this
is
followed
by
mild
metallic
hops
which
give
the
finish
a
bit
of
an
edge
the
bitterness
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
where
the
maltiness
dares
not
return
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
o
a
well
crafted
dortmunder
drink
this
one
cold
the
lack
of
carbonation
makes
the
drinking
of
this
lager
a
bit
disappointing
otherwise
just
not
a
very
good
beer
here
but
you
never
know
what
youre
going
to
get
with
something
labeled
landbier
as
its
not
really
a
strict
style
give

the
taste

everything
you
look

theres
the

certainly
a
forgettable
one
d
sweet

lacking
a

in

the

minimal

this

malt
and
a
bit
of
hop
in
the
finish
it
light
to
medium
body
its
my
first
dortmunder
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
decent
though
for
5
a
bottle
ive
had
better
dortmunder
beers
starting
with
clevelands
own
great
lakes
dortmunder
an
alright
beer
overall
but
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
too
heavy
and
sweet
d
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
pleasant
beer
that
wont
wow
you
but
wont
disappoint
either
i
feel
that
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
feels
very
solid
but
doesnt
offer
much
in
terms
of
sophistication
nothing
wrong
with
that
it
does
its
job
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
malty
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
superbly
drinkable
despite
the
minor
flaw
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
d
a
very
easy
drinker
if
not
unremarkable
a
good
novice
beer
i
suppose
but
its
id
look
elsewhere
to
find
a
better
traditional
hell
domestic
augustiner
hell
overall
not
super
experienced
whelles
lagers
but
not
the
tastiest
ive
had
or
very
memorable
drinkability
better
than
american
beerpong
swill
light
gold
color
with
a
wet
filmy
white
head
leaves
some
spotted
lacing
boring
grains
and
pale
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
slight
bready
sweetness
flavor
is
similar
with
grains
and
biscuity
malt
theres
a
balancing
earthy
hoppiness
thats
a
little
grassy
and
a
little
metallic
very
low
bitterness
thin
and
a
little
watery
but
this
is
a
clear
step
up
over
your
average
crappy
pale
lager
easy
to
drink
just
very
typical
a
session
beer
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
toasty
bread
crust
and
mild
but
firm
grass
pine
herbs
honey
yeastiness
and
apple
its
smooth
and
lightly
on
the
oily
side
with
an
engaging
zestiness
making
it
light
but
tasty
subtly
complex
and
very
satisfying
it
has
a
light
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
give
a
light
bite
in
finish
the
flavours
last
well
never
degrading
and
it
is
a
smooth
fullbodied
solid
german
lager
is
good
ya
the
first
of
its
style
for
me
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
thick
white
head
ok
retention
and
good
lacing
smell
is
somewhat
lemony
but
a
metallic
twist
to
it
as
well
strong
malt
presence
in
the
nose
taste
is
good
malty
with
a
lemon
zest
and
a
strong
grassy
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
a
good
beer
it
wasnt
amazing
but
a
strong
lemonlike
presence
made
it
easily
drinkable
best
served
nice
and
cold
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
drinkability
far
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
drank
really
easy
im
sure
this
is
great
fresh
would
gladdly
try
again
if
i
could
assure
that
this
is
very
crisp
clean
refreshing
pale
lager
thats
really
about
all
i
ask
for
in
a
munich
pale
lager
its
beers
like
this
that
make
germans
feel
like
kings
of
the
beer
world
i
always
approach
german
imports
with
some
caution
seeing
as
how
they
can
lose
their
lustre
fairly
easily
sitting
on
a
store
shelf
in
this
instance
i
got
lucky
my
bottle
had
clearly
not
been
sitting
overly
long
the
hop
character
was
clean
and
nonskunky
the
aroma
was
mostly
maltybready
with
just
a
hint
of
spicy
hop
it
had
a
full
malty
flavor
and
a
brisk
hoppy
bite
to
dry
out
the
finish
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
to
any
lagerlieber
with
luck
your
pivo
purveyor
has
followed
the
directive
on
the
label
kühl
und
dunkel
lagern
reuterberger
export
hell
is
yet
another
pale
lager
that
id
love
to
drink
at
the
source
i
get
the
feeling
that
its
better
than
the
beer
that
found
its
way
into
my
glass
today
even
so
i
like
the
fact
that
its
hoppier
than
most
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
verify
a
reasonable
amount
of
freshness
took
a
chance
at
the
beer
store
and
what
do
you
know
this
aint
bad
dusty
goldenrod
in
the
glass
my
12
inch
white
head
has
died
down
to
14
inch
but
still
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
slightly
yeasty
and
bready
taste
is
also
slightly
bready
with
a
faint
note
of
metallic
in
the
finish
aftertaste
is
a
bit
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
pretty
drinkable
as
in
its
been
quite
a
day
at
work
and
i
could
drink
more
than
one
3
45
at
downtown
wine
and
spirits
if
you
really
need
to
know
drinkability

this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
the
strong
sweetness
and
off
mouthfeel
mean
i
probably
wont
buy
again

5
liter
bottle
this
beer
has
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
grainy
aroma
too
much
like
corn
the
flavor
is
quite
husky
which
partially
covers
up
the
german
hops
the
finish
is
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
drinkability
is
diminished
by
the
corn
aroma
and
husky
flavors
which
are
quite
distracting
most
of
the
smaller
breweries
in
germany
make
great
beers
therefore
while
this
beer
isnt
terrible
it
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
nice
overall
helles
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
beautiful
soft
and
creamy
white
head
that
laces
very
well
the
aroma
is
a
subdued
sweet
maltiness
with
no
real
expressive
hop
presence
noted
in
other
words
just
like
a
helles
should
be
the
flavor
is
a
sweet
maltiness
with

with
faint

smell
was
lacking
much
substance
some
wheat
faint
but
surprisingly
the
taste
packed
a
bit
more
punch
great
lacing
as
each
drink
produced
more
head
and
left
evidence
of
my
gobblage
sweet
aftertaste
and
partially
cleansing
finish
but
not
dry
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
what
it
is
refreshing
light
but
enough
taste
to
let
you
know
there
was
some
imagination
and
effort
put
into
this
pup
caramel
comes
into
play
in
the
middle
and
it
is
slightly
syrupy
for
a

love
to
get
this
in
a
sixer
i
can
only
find
it
as

25oz
oh
well
ill
continue
to
buy
this
beer
for
casual
after
work
sessioning
pours
a
radiant
golden
hue
with
some
cloudy
sediment
and
a
small
brilliant
white
head
aroma
of
banana
is
evident
as
soon
as
the
cap
is
popped
but
then
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
clean
smell
of
german
lager
yeast
and
mild
fruity
hops
palate
is
understated
a
balance
of
mild
hops
and
light
sweet
malt
and
more
nice
clean
lager
yeast
very
nice
creamy
body
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
a
bit
light
on
flavor
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
settles
nicely
leaving
a
small
amount
of
lace
sweeter
malty
aroma
with
some
mineral
along
with
a
light
toastiness
but
pretty
cleantaste
is
very
german
some
toasted
malt
and
honey
with
a
big
mineral
flavor
that
comes
thru
late
and
lingers
a
nice
helles
clean
and
soft
a
real
quaffer
woulld
be
real
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
sure
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
nice
crisp
carbonation
mediumfull
body
nice
feel
but
flavor
is
not
there
brutal
begins
with
that
notion
of
of
lightly
toasty
sesame
seeds
then
moves
into
a
grainier
breadiness
traces
of
honeyed
sweetness
at
time
suggesting
corn
though
that
is
certainly
not
present
a
harsh
minerality
precedes
a
vegetal
bitterness
which
eventually
gives
way
to
lemonrind
and
herbal
hops
it
gets
better
as
it
sits
awhile
but
remains
pretty
disorganized
somewhat
akin
to
a
lager
from
another
european
country
but
as
a
german
entry
it
lacks
the
typical
helles
finesse
it
has
all
the
traits
of
a
decent
one
except
one
taste
pours
a
clean
golden
and
sports
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
and
a
good
solid
stick
throughout
aromas
are
sweet
and
malt
driven
in
the
mouth
the
beer
is
rich
and
again
sweet
and
malt
focused
to
the
point
of
being
a
tad
cloying
and
flabby
the
flavors
are
extracted
and
concentrated
sweet
malt
with
a
mild
kiss
of
hop
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
start
the
night
but
not
one
id
easily
drink
a
second
unless
i
had
a
mustard
crusted
pork
chop
and
some
noodles
thrown
my
way
a
drinkable
brew
that
is
pretty
much
just
another
eurolager
overall
a
reasonable
helles
but
nothing
special
this
was
a
decent
helles
lager
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
on
what
turned
out
to
be
a
hot
day
no
complaints
here
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
light
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malt
flavor
follows
with
light
sweet
bready
malt
slight
caramel
and
a
hint
of
light
fruit
finish
is
attenuated
and
slightly
dry
light
bodied
nothing
outstanding
but
the
light
flavor
is
pleasant
and
something
i
would
have
again
with
a
meal
or
sitting
in
ethiopia
with
no
craft
beer
store
in
sight
fun
fact
this
brewery
was
recently
sold
to
heineken
maybe
thats
why
it
just
showed
up
in
retail
shops
here
overall
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
nothing
outstanding
by
any
means
but
certainly
better
than
a
lot
of
other
typical
lagers
i
might
have
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
other
ethiopian
beers
in
the
future
this
lager
pours
a
crystal
golden
color
with
a
mild
white
head
that
fades
quickly
there
is
almost
no
aroma
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
with
a
pleasant
but
brief
fizzing
in
the
mouth
this
is
not
an
unpleasant
beer
and
if
i
lived
in
ethiopia
i
would
probably
drink
it
regularly
with
so
many
other
choices
of
good
import
and
domestic
beers
in
the
midwest
this
will
not
be
one
of
my
top
choices
not
knowing
at
all
what
to
expect
from
a
heretofore
to
me
unexperienced
african
nations
brewing
prowess
i
can
say
that
this
is
not
too
shabby
more
reminiscent
of
malty
british
pale
ales
but
i
cant
fault
the
existing
classification
either
interesting
and
plainly
drinkable
d
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
about
three
dozen
examples
of
this
style
that
i
like
better
clean
flavor
through
and
through
though
and
at
paired
well
with
ethiopian
cuisine
drinkability
as
it
is
a
guest
in
this
country
ill
politely
tolerate
it
youve
had
one
lager
from
a
third
world
country
youve
had
them
all
from
a
twelve
ounce
brown
bottle
pours
palestraw
color
with
a
tad
of
haze
no
carbonation
or
head
smells
of
sweet
corn
adjuncts
and
not
much
hops
in
the
aroma
first
sip
is
malty
sweet
with
corn
dominating
the
malts
my
second
beer
from
ethiopia
and
both
were
better
tasting
than
i
thought
they
would
pretty
good
for
the
style
d
someone
at
the
table
mentioned
that
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
bmc
i
have
to
agree
it
is
light
and
tasty
may
actually
enjoy
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
beer
was
very
light
but
had
a
nice
note
of
caramel
for
some
character
i
could
see
this
as
a
great
beer
for
a
session
in
the
90
degree
shade
the
tang
note
does
increase
as
the
beer
warms
which
gets
in
the
way
of
the
malt
a
bit
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
ive
tried
other
ethiopian
beers
in
the
past
and
have
been
quite
disappointed
with
their
weak
ricey
beers
but
this
one
was
quite
different
it
pairs
well
with
ethiopian
fare
go
figure
but
would
also
pair
nicely
with
a
smooth
chevre
or
possibly
even
some
thai
dishes
i
couldnt
see
myself
buying
cases
of
this
brand
but
i
could
see
a
nice
summer
day
spent
sipping
down
a
few
sixers
definitely
worth
a
try
it
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
had
this
at
merkato
a
restaurantmarket
in
the
little
ethiopia
section
of
los
angeles
the
pour
is
an
uninspiring
slightly
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
small
white
head
even
in
the
tom
collins
glass
that
they
gave
me
the
lacing
was
decent
lots
of
doughy
malt
in
the
nose
with
faint
noble
hop
aromas
the
taste
is
pretty
much
along
those
lines
biscuity
and
doughy
malts
grain
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
finishes
with
a
subtle
pilsnerinfluenced
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
less
carbonation
then
average
this
beer
is
solid
and
drinkable
it
exceeded
my
expectations
and
then
some
o
my
dad
tells
me
this
is
what
beer
snobs
were
drinking
like
45
years
ago
yikes
guess
weve
got
it
pretty
good
these
days
there
really
isnt
anything
special
about
this
at
all
but
if
the
name
of
the
beer
was
just
export
well
it
just
wouldnt
have
a
nice
ring
to
it
a
fair
lawnmower
beer
if
ice
cold
i
cant
say
i
was
very
impressed
meh
special
ex
is
best
consumed
with
food
which
has
the
felicitous
effect
of
negating
the
negatives
of
the
beer
while
emphasizing
the
positives
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
not
a
good
beer
by
reading
other
reviews
its
apparent
that
most
people
dont
remember
the
special
export
brewed
by
heileman
when
it
was
brewed
in
lacross
wisconsin
at
that
time
special
export
was
a
krausened
beer
like
old
style
and
was
a
beer
a
big
step
up
from
old
style
or
pretty
much
any
other
of
the
hundreds
of
ordinary
beers
of
its
day
like
ballantine
xxx
ale
export
pretty
much
only
exists
in
label
and
fond
memories
or
earlier
days
found
this
at
city
wide
liquors
in
downtown
south
bend
in
i
hadnt
seen
special
export
in
years
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
poured
from
a
can
couldve
been
worse
couldve
been
better
pretty
much
a
mediocre
beer
with
a
mediocre
taste
meh
wtf
is
an
export
lager
never
heard
that
terminology
before
o
its
not
dortmunder
gold
but
its
better
than
something
like
dab
and
for
5
99
for
a
6pack
of
tallboys
you
cant
do
much
better
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
unoffensive
its
readily
available
here
and
ill
grab
it
before
miller
or
something
similar
when
im
in
the
mood
to
just
have
an
easydrinking
cheap
session
beer
overall
and
like
i
stated
before
this
is
my
goto
cheap
beer
for
camping
canoeing
sunday
football
it
actually
has
flavor
and
drinkability
but
only
costs
me
5
for
a
sixer
of
tall
boys
cheers
rjt
its
refreshing
which
will
come
in
handy
in
the
coming
months
with
summer
looming
its
been
several
years
since
ive
enjoyed
one
so
i
cant
give
a
better
review
until
my
next
trip
to
the
great
white
north
ill
edit
this
review
as
soon
as
i
can
refresh
my
memory
whan
i
go
back
to
chicago
ill
get
a
case
of
bottles
to
bring
home
with
the
green
can
and
skunky
hop
presence
i
can
only
imagine
they
are
going
for
a
heineken
clone
here
not
too
successful
but
hey
the
can
is
cool
i
guess
thanks

from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
taste
is
very
mild
crisp
and
light
not
much
going
on
at
all
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
otherwise
mediocre
my
pour
initially
produced
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
but
its
retention
level
caused
it
to
do
a
pretty
quick
fade
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
holy
nose
batman
this
actually
smelled
like
clean
unadulterated
lager
it
had
a
clean
lager
sweetness
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
oh
be
still
my
beating
heart
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
smooth
pleasant
flavor
of
simple
lager
slightly
sweet
with
a
touch

in

finish
was
equally
pleasant

devoid

off

houston
we
have
a
winner
this
is
definitely
going
into
my
cooler
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
score
some
on
a
routine
basis
from
what
i
remember
its
best
quality
was
drinkabilty
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
taste
and
smell
werent
bad
either
although
it
was
thin
and
watery
it
had
a
nice
carbonation
to
it
the
appearance
was
not
impressive
in
the
least
but
what
do
you
expect
not
a
bad
beer
pong
beer
if
i
do
say
so
myself
if
i
am
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
with
some
decent
flavor
i
will
pick
this
up
i
have
always
wondered
if
the
abv
is
higher
than
most
macros
drinkability
is
pretty
good
while
it
isnt
a
fulfilling
beer
its
not
bad
for
the
football
season
and
for
12
a
case
you
certainly
cant
beat
it
served
straight
from
a
can
nothing
really
special
with
the
look
normal
beer
golden
color
little
head
which
quickly
dissolves
smell
nothing
special
and
nothing
pungent
taste
better
than
your
normal
pabst
brewery
beer
average
overall
nothing
special
but
to
me
my
beer
tasted
fresh
which
was
a
plus
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
average
overall
its
an
average
beer
which
is
a
good
thing
to
me
its
also
a
good
thirst
quencher
this
beer
turned
out
a
bit
better
than
i
remembered
this
was
a
staple
while
i
was
growing
up
the
can
has
changed
but
the
product
is
still
similar
light
yellow
appearance
and
cheap
beer
smell
the
taste
is
crisp
and
an
attempt
not
to
offend
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
thinner
than
it
used
to
be
this
is
an
ok
low
priced
beer
for
kicking
back
in
the
garage
at
such
a
cheap
price
this
is
quite
drinkable
especially
when
just
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
this
would
be
and
excellent
choice
the
old
classic
green
death
bottle
smell
is
corny
and
sweet
poured
into
a
tankard
great
head
tiny
bubbles
real
foamy
golden
color
taste
is
very
pilsnerlike
good
carbonation
no
notable
bitters
even
in
finish
taste
is
same
throughout
kind
of
boring
good
lawnmower
beer
recommend
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
i
rememeber
this
tasting
a
lot
better
on
the
4th
maybe
i
had
a
few
too
many
and
better
out
of
a
can
instead
of
poured
into
a
glass
if
youre
going
to
pick
up
a
cheapy
make
it
this
one
but
do
yourself
a
favor
and
leave
it
in
the
can
it
looks
like
heilemans
special
export
has
a
strong
local
following
im
not
sure
why
since
its
really
no
different
from
pbr
or
hamms
or
old
style
or
what
have
you
this
is
drinkable
beer
in
a
pinch
but
dont
kid
yourself
that
its
anything
special
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
but
i
do
prefer
some
of
heilmanns
other
offerings
this
could
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
quite
the
macro
even
in
the
can
when
trolling
the
sale
macro
beers
at
my
local
house
of
refreshment
this
is
a
must
buy
not
the
finest
beer
you
will
ever
taste
but
a
very
good
one
when
price
is
factored
into
the
equation
crisp
hoppy
and
sharp
at
first
i
find
that
while
the
flavor
fades
quickly
there
is
no
aftertaste
which
replaces
it
meaning
one
must
take
another
drink
not
a
bad
proposition
mouthfeel
is
light
as
expected
and
drinkability
is
on
par
with
the
style
drinkability
was
good
because
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
them
again
keeps
the
tolerance
up
without
blowing
lots
of
a
surprisingly
good
lager
in
a
place
i
would
not
have
expected
it
hard
to
believe
that
pabst
made
this
an
american
beer
from
a
macrobrewery
that
is
good
a
nice
surprise
in
the
glass
at
2
99
for
a
six
pack
i
normallly
distaste
pale
domestic
lagers
but
this
one
seems
to
be
the
best
10
99
30
pack
it
cannot
be
beat
much
better
than
the
carbonated
water
that
bud
is
my
friend
used
to
buy
this
and
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
before
i
even
thought
of
trying
a
heineken
which
i
think
tasts
terrible
now
this
was
one
of
those
beers
where
when
it
turns
out
not
to
be
as
bad
as
you
expected
it
then
almost
seems
good
bright
pale
gold
with
assertive
carbonation
sweetish
with
some
vague
corn
flavor
and
hopping
that
comes
across
with
a
bit
of
artificial
grape
flavoring
no
skunking
despite
the
green
bottle
which
makes
me
think
that
some
stabilizer
must
be
in
play
here
id
probably
take
this
over
many
of
the
basic
eurolager
crowd
drinkability
a
definite
easy
drinker
i
could
sit
back
and
quaff
these
all
day
and
at
6
99
a
12
it
would
be
cheap
to
do
so
pours
clear
and
golden
yellow
into
the
glass
minimal
head
but
fairly
decent
lacing
i
used
to
drink
the
shit
out
of
this
stuff
when
i
was
younger
i
am
over
that
but
at
14
00
for
a
30
pack
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
try
again
smell
doesnt
impress
corny
grainy
somewhat
chemical
that
is
about
it
light
carbonation
burn
followed
by
a
corny
taste
not
awfull
but
not
good
either
i
dont
feel
ripped
off
but
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
neccesarily
reccomend
either
a
cheap
watery
american
lager
you
get
what
you
pay
for
not
much
nothing
i
would
ever
pay
money
for
pours
a
very
clear
and
bright
golden
yellow
medium
thick
white
head
forms
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
honey
grass
citrus
some
floral
hops
kind
of
perfumy
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
some
iron
citrus
and
floral
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
carbonation
is
medium
to
low
really
not
a
bad
adjunct
lager
the
carbonation
is
a
ton
lower
than
any
other
adjunct
lager
ive
had
so
theres
more
flavour
and
its
real
smooth
can
obtained
with
a
bunch
of
other
stuff
as
a
reward
for
volunteering
for

late

that
mix
with

too
simple
to
be
even
a
session
beer
light
body
and
md
carbonation
rated
to
style
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
is
more
of
a
macro
adjunct
lager
than
a
dortmunder
and
i
reviewed
it
as
such
this
was
brewed
in
milwaukee
clear
gold
capped
with
a
bright
white
head
the
head
diminishes
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
very
fizzy
and
light
on
the
tongue
nose
is
neutral
maybe
some
adjunct
grass
and
slight
yeast
light
flavor
with
the
same
adjuncts
found
in
the
aroma
but
primarily
clean
finishes
crisp
slight
aftertaste
quite
drinkable
honestly
now
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
friggin
macro
poured
out
to
a
clear
golden
color
with
medium
carbonation
a
12
inch
head
was
present
but
quickly
dissipated
no
traces
of
lace
noted
aromas
of
malt
and
adjunct
with
a
floral
like
quality
as
well
taste
is
very
comparable
to
other
import
lagers
as
that
is
what
heilmann
was
going
for
flavors
of
corn
malt
oats
grain
and
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
finished
crisp
with
a
touch
of
dryness
this
is
a
well
made
macro
would
make
a
killer
session
beer
if
you
like
import
lagers
like
heineken
becks
or
the
like
this
is
the
beer
for
you
at
half
the
price
this
is
also
a
good
place
to
make
your
start
for
micros
and
higher
quality
beers
if
youre
still
stuck
in
swillland
recommended
this
is
the
dog
of
the
pabst
line
next
to
old
style
or
even
regular
pbr
it
cant
stand
up
this
beer
has
the
flavor
of
its
container
if
its
from
a
bottle
or
tap
then
you
are
lucky
and
it
is
at
best
flavorless
from
a
can
it
tastes
like
aluminum
a
great
beer
for
heavy
smokers
as
it
allows
you
to
save
money
for
cigarettes
while
not
noticing
that
your
beer
is
nickel
and
cadmium
flavored
not
a
great
lager
but
a
respectable
one
and
its
actually
drinkable
this
used
to
be
a
treat
when
younger
and
its
still
an
ok
swiller
i
d
have
one
anytime
this
is
probably
more
micro
like
than
a
lot
of
the
macro
brews
not
bad
at
all
drinking
it
from
a
pilsner
glass
i
never
would
have
guessed
it
as
special
ex
old
style
still
has
a
sweeter
flavor
to
it
probably
from
all
the
corn
each
is
decent
in
its
own
way
this
is
closer
to
a
beer
geeks
beer
where
old
style
is
more
of
a
swill
ill
drink
either
one
i
hope
this
beer
is
made
especially
to
export
decent
for
a
macro
nothing
too
offensive
or
too
special
about
special
export
highly
carbonated
pours
to
a
sudsy
head
that
dissapears
quickly
kinda
dark
for
a
fizzy
yellow
american
lager
taste
is
clean
with
noticable
corn
adjunct
finishes
with
a
bit
of
warmth
and
bitter
bite
tastes
a
bit
strong
in
the
alcohol
department
if
given
the
choice
i
definitely
have
to
take
this
over
the
typical
bmc
offerings
clear
straw
with
a
fizzy
short
head
and
no
real
lace
to
speak
of
sweetish
smell
barely
brown
sugar
light
body
with
generous
carbonation
flavor
is
hardly
outstanding
but
there
is
a
sense
of
bare
grain
to
the
malt
any
adjuncts
seem
to
be
background
players
and
theres
a
pabst
blue
ribbon
bit
of
real
hop
balance
the
carbonation
while
lively
combines
well
with
the
hop
and
doesnt
fizz
down
the
throat
as
in
some
cheaper
lagers
i
will
probably
drink
a
few
more
cans
of
this
along
with
dumping
them
in
coolers
at
cookouts
the
taste
however
aint
bad
smooth
with
a
slight
warming
hit
at
the
end
which
follows
a
blast
of
sweet
malts
and
yes
a
hint
of
malts
not
bad
not
great
but
not
bad
perhaps
a
good
starter
beer
for
college
drinkers
looking
for
a
small
stepup
without
investing
all
the
book
money
you
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
if
you
wish
this
looks
and
sounds
like
a
premium
beer
it
is
basically
a
typical
american
macro
lager
it
pours
pale
with
a
dry
white
head
some
hops
are
present
the
nose
smells
malt
and
grain
quite
good
carbonation
finishes
with
a
sweet
maltgrain
aftertaste
not
bad
for
a
cheap
beer
in
a
30
pack
but
not
good
either
where
is
this
stuff
exported
to
flavor
is
much
the
same
bready
malts
are
center
stage
some
light
floral
hops
lend
minimal
bitterness
light
sweetness
and
pretty
smooth
some
cereal
grains
and
florals
in
the
dry
aftertaste
overall
its
ok
not
as
rustic
as
expected
for
a
landbier
but
certainly
something
there
in
the
simplicity
and
nuance
thats
worthwhile
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
the
dryness
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
the
fruitiness
is
also
unusual
for
a
lager
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
levels
of
medium
intensity
the
result
is
a
slightly
fizzy
mouthfeel
at
first
which
quickly
settles
to
become
foamy
and
smooth
closes
fairly
dry
though
not
totally
with
significant
stickiness
across
the
palate
worth
a
try
but
the
bottled
version
isnt
really
worth
hunting
for
picked
up
a
5l
swingtop
at
euro
market
certainly
has
that
dortmunder
character
with
creamy
clean
barley
malt
this
ones
a
little
more
crisp
and
dry
bready
grains
the
beer
is
balanced
through
the
finish
and
a
tough
light
in
body
for
the
style
but
you
can
just
call
it
a
more
drinkable
take
on
the
export
lager
its
winter
now
but
i
imagine
this
would
make
a
fine
lawnmower
beer
this
was
a
beer
i
acquired
when
i
was
unofficially
dubbed
a
tester
of
a
six
pack
shop
i
am
soso
on
german
beers
over
all
i
did
enjoy
the
lightness
of
the
beer
all
around
it
was
a
refreshing
change
it
was
rather
malty
and
smooth
it
somewhat
resembled
the
taste
of
straub
it
finished
a
bit
on
the
earthy
side
yet
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
flavor
isnt
as
good
it
is
slightly
tart
with
some
pretty
mediocre
malt
flavors
the
hops
dont
work
either
very
nice
one
quite
drinkable
with
pleasant
dominating
bitterness
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
lighter
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
to
rave
about
pours
a
clear
quite
deep
gold
under
a
firm
1
5
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
film
and
collar
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
excellent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
full
of
floral
hops
almost
like
sniffing
a
bouquet
of
flowers
the
mouth
is
quite
light
and
fairly
prickly
nice
flavors
here
although
the
malt
is
a
bit
subdued
the
hops
are
strong
but
far
more
flowery
than
bitter
the
taste
is
not
exactly
sweet
but
closer
to
spicey
with
just
a
touch
of
espresso
dryness
which
redoubles
its
presence
after
the
swallow
a
very
pleasant
experience
i
could
be
happy
drinking
this
for
quite
a
while
the
head
pour
by
the
bottle
is
incredibly
dense
and
large
it
leaves
an
impressive
lace
that
really
gets
the
taste
buds
flaired
up
the
color
is
a
light
transparent
gold
and
the
drinker
can
see
the
massive
quantities
of
small
bubbles
dancing
around
shes
a
looker
alright
taste
is
intriguing
at
first
but
then
just
damn
good
all
flavors
are
light
but
a
tangy
bitterness
really
stands
out
creamy
qualtities
are
noticeable
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
quite
interesting
beer
a
lager
with
7
alcohol
and
i
do
not
even
taste
it
though
it
warms
nice
malty
exeperience
without
beeing
sweet
guess
this
would
be
a
great
to
balance
spicy
food
overall
a
nice
experience
it
was
like
i
was
drinking
one
of
the
meilente
spring
bocks
but
with
the
high
alcohol
not
being
so
obviously
present
this
is
a
style
that
is
lacking
on
the
american
beer
landscape
and
i
doubt
nay
challenge
it
to
be
done
better
overall
sweeter
and
stronger
version
of
the
german
style
o
nice
one
interesting
different
definitely
worth
trying
a
nice
enough
strong
lager
but
it
is
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
my
tastes
descent
beer
according
to
style
a
very
nice
drink
and
one
i
will
look
out
for
again
i
have
had
beers
from
dortmund
but
dont
remember
them
being
so
interesting
as
this
dort
is
maybe
they
were
pilsners
and
not
dorts
taste
is
very
malty
and
bitter
with
a
nice
sizzle
from
the
carbonation
the
special
malts
give
the
beer
a
caramel
and
breadiness
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
dry
body
is
medium
to
thin
and
fits
this
beerstyle
drinkability
is
high
because
of
its
thin
body
and
balance
between
malt
and
bitter
this
is
one
of
those
beers
made
without
many
pretensions
i
left
this
beer
a
bit
too
long
in
my
fridge
bb
mar06
but
having
been
kept
cold
the
beer

german
lager
you
are
immersed
in
everything
all
four
of
them
that
goes
into
making
it
pleasantly
malty
though
maybe
lacking
a
bit
overall
in
the
crisp
biscuity
department
at
any
rate
flavourful
simple
and
pretty
easy
to
put
back
not
to
mention
that
the

sub

bucks
for
a

or
weissbier
applies
here
as
well
no
need
to
search
for
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
when
i
picked
this
up
at
the
store
but
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
its
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
the
flavors
are
unique
and
its
a
perfect
beer
for
grilling
out
or
chilling
out
on
a
summery
day
now
if
those
days
would
only
get
here
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
grab
some
more

this
summer
the
drink
is
surprisingly
substantial
and
on
the
full
side
of

nicely
carbonated
with
great
drinkability
i
would
say
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew

you
can
get
past

the
taste
is

the

a

touch
of
grain

balance
out
the
beer

enjoyed
this
beer

of
the

with
a

quite

this
beer
was
accidentally
opened
at
work
today
so
i
figured
id
partake
in
its
contents
for
the
sake
of
it
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
hard
water
light
grass
and
flowers
everything
is
mild
and
muddled
in
an
inoffensive
way
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grass
and
flowers
coming
through
a
bit
more
powerfully
though
not
enough
to
really
help
this
beer
claw
its
way
out
of
mediocrity
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
nice
little
beer
better
than
i
expected
thanks
to
some
bad
experiences
with
pale
polish
lagers
but
nothing
at
all
memorable
o
allinall
one
of
the
better
polish
standards
ive
had
apart
from
a
light
body
some
sweetness
and
a
bit
high
abv
this
is
a
nice
malty
and
grassy
lager
good
for
warm
summer
days
or
with
lighter
foods
picked
up
a
bottle
at
euromarket
in
astoria
aside
from
the
bit
of
skunk
this
is
a
decent
beer
shame
about
the
green
glass
bottle
theres
a
crisp
bready
toast
with
just
a
touch
of
caramel
slight
spicy
hops
finish
the
beer
is
what
seems
to
be
a
fine
but
abused
example
of
the
style
i
hope
to
find
a
fresher
find
some
day
d
a
nice
export
lager
with
the
green
bottle
i
wasnt
expecting
as
much
but
a
solid
beer
a
refreshing
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
washing
down
the
brats
and
sourkraut
flavors
are
simple
candi
sugar
banana
belgian
fruit
and
cooked
stone
fruits
pleasant
but
almost
sweet
and
somewhat
one
dimensional
without
a
lot
of
character
pleasant
but
simple
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
fizzy
this
is
a
straight
up
throw
back
beer
without
alot
going
on
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
exciting
this
is
fairly
agreeable
in
flavor
with
a
little
malt
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
and
an
overall
grainy
almost
vegetative
quality
to
the
malt
however
it
is
inoffensive
and
slightly
watery
and
the
finish
is
crisp
and
somewhat
bitter
more
or
less
what
i
expected
although
not
altogether
terrible
this
is
comparable
to
most
of
polands
top
lagers
and
better
than
a
few
not
that
there
arent
higher
compliments
i
could
give
a
beer
good
and
refreshing
though
id
love
to
get
a
fresh
sample
of
this
without
the
skunky
aroma
d
overall
a
bland
and
boring
entry
a
beer
you
wouldnt
feel
guilty
dumping
after
sampling
half
a
glass
pours
a
clear
straw

with
a
fast
falling

is

flavor
exhibits
much
the

just
a
bland
and
boring
lager
feel
has
very
little
bubble
on
the
tongue
and
a
very
thin
liquid
feel
average
drinkability
at
best
a
bit
different
than
the
typical
german
pilsners
but
absolutely
a
very
good

malt
sweetness
abounds
in
this
lager
lingering
hoppiness
in
the
finish
i
could
enjoy
this
one
again
nothing
quenches
the
thirst
like
a
fine
polish
lager
and
the
lomza
export
is
certainly
no
expection
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
f4
maelstrom
of
carbonation
common
to
many
polish
lagers
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
and
the
taste
is
very
similar
i
like
diversification
but
i
do
lean
towards
sweeter
beers
and
this
one
appeals
to
me
more
probably
because
of
its
underlying
sweetness
this
beer
went
perfectly
with
my
melted
mozarella
topped

pretzel
and
home
made

the
top
shamefully
thin
and
the
finish
scantily
hopped
with
a
middling
carbonation
and
the
ever
present
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
just
to
thinwaisted
for
me

still

notes
a
very
good
export
lager
potent
with
many
malt
liquor
qualities
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
sulfuric
note
the
beer
is
light
and
has
some
lemony
yeast
character
o
a
dortmunder
that
is
kind
of
mild
in
smell
while
the
taste
is
stronger
and
better
than
the
smell
led
me
to
believe

very
positive

might
be

pleonasm
o

glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
certainly
nothing
mind

dont
let
the
bright
colour
and
clarity
fool
you
this
is
no
light
lager
good
dortmunders
which
certainly
describes
this
have
a
particular
gratification
that
few
other
pale
lagers
save
pilsners
can
usually
offer
its
a
style
that
requires
no
imagination
its
simply
refreshing
delicious
beer
and
therein
lies
its
strength
this
reminded
me
of
how
good
the

have
it

a
high
c
hüttenbier
is
a
passable
dortmunder
but
by
no
means
is
it
a
particularly
good
one
it
tastes
ok
and
is
drinkable
but
i
cannot
find
any
reasons
to
offer
any
more
praise
than
that
dab
is
cheaper
better
and
available
everywhere
so
there
is
just
no
reason
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
stuff
id
drink
this
if
it
were
being
offered
but
its
not
something
id
bother
to
buy
again
in
a
slightly
more
positive
vein
if
you
see
this
for
a
decent
price
and
are
in
the
mood
for
a
thirstquenching
german
lager
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
but
i
wouldnt
bother
seeking
it

not

that
i
drink

its

the

is
very
good
with
some
yeast
attributes
which
bring
to
mind
fresh
baked
bread
with
light
herbal
flavor
from
the
hops
with
a
nice
toasted
middle
and
gentle
fruitiness
from
either
the
hops
or
yeast
with
a
slight
dimethyl
sulfide
attribute
which
seems
more
like
corn
than
anything
there
is
hardly
any
diacetyl
and
the
lager
has
a
very
mild
sweetness
as
it

theres
just

i
always
appreciate
a
solid
lager
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
makes
for
a
great
appearance
during
those
hot
summer
days
scent
is
a
nice
blend
of
caramel
malts
and
noble
hops
giving
it
the
authentic
german
pilsner
scent
the
taste
is
comprised
of
soft
mellow
grains
that
compliment
each
other
very
nicely
it
also
has
some
hints
of
citrus
and
a
slight
spice
as
well
that
finishes
nice
and
crisp
quite
a
refreshing
summer
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
or
too
light
taste
is
sharp
at
first
with
a
definite
bread
and
yeast
character
hints
of
citrus
hops
are
also
omnipresent
making
this
one
a
very
tasty
balanced
and
welldone
lager
i
would
drink
more
of
these
no
problem
i
am
rating
this
beer
very
highly
because
i
think
it
absolutely
nails
this
style
perhaps
improving
on
it
if
you
dont
like
this
style
youre
not
going
to
agree
with
me
but
if
you
do
you
shouldnt
miss
this
one
beautifully
executed
i
am
becoming
a
big
fan
of
this
brewery
o
not
a
bad
beer
decent
representation
of
the
style
and
possibly
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
by
two
brothers
o
an
easy
drinker
not
as
crisp
and
dry
as
i
expect
and
want
from
my
lagers
and
pilsners
but
a
serviceable
option
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
dog
days
of
august
light
amber
in
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
to
the
surface
really
nice
and
tight
looking
as
white
head
of
maybe
an
inch
and
a
half
came
up
and
settled
down
fading
slightly
but
holding
its
own
light
grains
and
bready
malt
notes
really
pulling
through
here
some
smattering
of
hops
in
there
but
again
nothing
really
pushing
that
way
this
was
a
well
rounded
and
very
straight
forward
lager
as
i
take
the
first
sip
crisp
clean
flavor
rolls
across
the
taste
buds
really
very
well
put
together
earthy
nice
touches
of
grain
and
smooth
mellow
caramel
notes
infiltrate
as
it
warms
light
banana
and
clove
maybe
then
coming
through
i
am
very
pleased
here
as
the
light
body
and
ample
carbonation
make
for
something
that
went
down
like
water
overall
this
was
a
surprisingly
decent
drink
id
get
this
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
pretty
clear
gold
colored
brew
but
there
is
some
chill
haze
smallish
pillowy
white
head
nice
lace
scent
is
sweet
and
grainy
pretty
grainy
taste
malts
dominate
liquid
bread
nice
kiss
of
hops
as
well
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
well
put
together
lager
pretty
sharp
on
the
tongue
good
brew
id
get
it
again
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
medium
pale
golden
with
a
significant
amount
of
foam
that
persists
quite
nicely
leaving
about
a
34
layer
on
top
and
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
decent
aroma
with
a
prevalent
maltiness
and
apricothop
notes
in
the
background
piney
hoppy
notes
come
to
the
fore
upon
tasting
maltiness
is
a
bit
more
understated
than
i
would
have
liked
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
welcome
fullbodiedness
though
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
an
enjoyable
drink
if
a
bit
hoppy
for
my
ideal
of
the
style
overall
a
very
nice
representation
of
a
dortmunder
lager
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
coming
out
every
year
near
summer
nice
thirst
quencher
very
sessionable
overall
pretty
decent
brew
im
never
disappointed
with
two
brothers
a
great
golden
color
with
little
head
when
served
the
smell
wasnt
very
powerful
but
definately
had
a
malty
smell
taste
was
very
crisp
and
clean
with
malt
flavors
very
prevalent
the
alcohol
content
kicks
nicely
on
the
way
down
definitely
a
great
summer
beer
thats
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
dd
has
a
real
nice
grain
and
malt
taste
the
real
joy
of
this
brew
is
the
full
and
flavorfull
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
brews
and
its
an
ideal
summer
session
lagger
o
an
average
dortmunder
that
did
not
have
enough
noble
hops
or
german
malts
for
the
style
it
was
however
a
thirst
quencher
and
one
that
i
will
have
again
flavor
is
similarly
light
easygoing
in
feel
soft
carbonation
with
a
slight
crispness
lightly
bready
with
a
gentle
toasted
malt
flavor
very
light
inkling
of
noble
hops
lending
a
hint
of
grassy
astringency
pairs
great
with
spicy
food
barbecue
just
about
anything
a
solid
session
candidate
as
well
its
well
made
with
no
flaws
a
good
gateway
craft
lager
for
the
novice
craft
drinker
locally
i
prefer
metropolitans
lagers
but
this
one
seems
targeted
for
a
broader
crowd
fine
but
not
a
must
have
this
seemed
like
a
nice
choice
to
finish
my
mixed
sixer
from
dobbys
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
small
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
very
light
caramel
light
walnut
and
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
grass
light
buttery
biscuits
wheat
and
walnut
the
body
is
a
heftyish
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
dort
nothing
wild
but
its
certainly
easygoing
enough
an
all
around
excellent
lager
i
really
love
it
something
that
i
highly
recommend
overall
the
dog
days
was
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
dortmunder
but
it
was
very
pleasant
nonetheless
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
at
least
if
two
brothers
decides
to
release
it
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
should
have
had
this
around
over
the
summer
important
none
of
the
chemical
aftertaste
of
the
big
commercial
lagers
or
of
the
really
cheap
versions
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
light
hops
as
well
as
some
grain
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
some
grassy
grain
and
a
bit
of
bread
and
caramel
in
the
taste
nice
light
body
with
really
great
drinkability
on
a
hot
day
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
have
been
better
and
much
more
drinkable
if
the
sweetness
wasnt
so
prevalent
d
good
for
a
hot
day
thirst
quencher
easy
drinking
not
much
else
d
id
buy
this
again
this
beer
just
makes
me
happy
avoid
this
very
light
head
hardly
any
foam
whats
there
is
clear
white
nada
lacing
the
slight
gauze
doesnt
effect
the
overall
transparency
straw
yellow
color
not
that
vivid
very
few
and
randomly
scattered
bubbles
has
the
appearance
of
a
beer
gone
flat
pretzel
dough
wheat
bread
in
the
nose
the
peppery
bite
and
hops
give
it
lots
of
verve
softened
by
a
light
florality
the
malts
lack
distinguishing
qualities
some
milk
chocolate
and
hard
butterscotch
candy
solid
apricot
peach
scents
without
seeming
fruity
overall
wellintegrated
and
easy
to
kick
back
and
sniff
mediumbodied
carbonation
gives
it
a
steady
churn
without
getting
in
the
way
of
smoother
drinkability
the
malted
milk
balls
and
chocolate
ease
the
mouth
entry
then
orange
to
lemon
citrus

up
greener
straw
and

notes
too
quieter
tone
to
the

however
consistently
there
slight
turn
to
bitterness
through
the
finish
keeps
it
lively
solid
crafted
to
be
so
rather
than
spectacular
a
rarer
and
rarer
thing
could
easily
put
a
few
down
in
one
sitting
did
i
mention
that
i
pretty
much
love
the
two
brothers
beers
ive
tried
this
is
the
nicest
easy
going
balanced
summer
session
beer
ive
come
across

a
bright

a

with

a

goes
quite
nicely
with
the
semi

a
sight
lemongrass
herba
tones
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light

solidly
carbonated
with
ample
co2
smooth
going
down
i
could
have
went
for
a
whole
six
instead
of
a
single
great
tasting
brew
that
deserves
be
drunk
in
number
during
the
dog
days
of
summer
d
would
be
easy
to
session
this
but
the
flavor
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
sessionable
particularly
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
meh
this
isnt
my
favorite
two
brothers
beer
something
ill
still
try
at
least
once
a
year
but
not
too
much
more
than
that
a
solid
lager
easy
to
drink
but
with
just
enough
extra
flavor
compared
to
many
in
this
category
to
set
itself
above
them
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
style
when
i
can
find
it
as
with
this
product
most
dortmunders
are
seasonal
offerings
this
is
ideal
for
the
hot
summer
months
d
drinkability
is
solid
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
that
true
german
maltiness
in
this
beer
its
trying
hard
but
falling
a
little
short
im
not
sure
about
this
one
nice
mouthfeel
and
appearance
but
the
aroma
immediately
tuned
me
off
and
the
flavor
wasnt
as
unified
as
it
should
be
not
something
ill
pick
up
again
pours
a
clear
golden
honey
color
with
a
wispy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
bready
malt
with
hints
of
grassy
bitterness
perhaps
a
touch
grainy
the
taste
is
light
and
somewhat
grainy
there
is
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
and
grassy
hop
bitterness
has
some
hay
like
characteristics
the
feel
is
moderate
with
active
carbonation
the
beer
starts
off
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
light
bitter
kick
a
tad
heavier
than
most
lagers
but
drinks
very
well
it
is
nice
to
see
another
american
brewery
make
this
style
as
it
is
a
good
summertime
brew
overall
great
beer
that
i
would
come
back
to
or
recommend
to
others
when
looking
for
a
lager
d
very
easy
to
drink
satisfying
tastes
weedymaybe
its
just
the
power
of
suggestion
maybe
its
just
the
european
hops
but
im
getting
a
strong
floral
profile
here
thats
almost
like
dandelions
that
drifts
towards
a
drier
earthier
middle
and
then
ends
on
long
dry
hops
d
good
session
beer
i
plan
to
go
to
this
frequently
over
the
summer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
choose
first
theres
something
not
quite
right
about
this
beer
too
sweet
too
fruity
they
said
it
was
their
only
lager
so
it
makes
sense
that
its
rather
alelike
d
this
could
be
a
really
easy
beer
to
drink
all
night
but
its
just
not
my
thing
d
off
the
charts
not
filling
and
extremely
partakable
refreshing
i
like
the
label
there
are
a
lot
of
lagers
like
this
out
there
but
its
not
a
dort
since
i
dont
buy
beers
for
labels
pass
great
tasty
session
brew
this
would
be
great
to
have
pouring
from
a
kegerator
throughout
summer
bravo
this
is
my
first
dortmunder
and
i
look
forward
to
comparing
it
to
some
other
offerings
m
d
medium
bodied
for
the
style
and
very
dry
very
lackluster
beer

been
paying
attention
the
name
makes
it
sound
stronger
than
what
it
is
so
ive
avoided
it
as
a
summer
drink
the
bartender
described
it
as
sweeter
than
a
pilsner
but
the
same
lightness
otherwise
thats
pretty
much
what
i
would
call
it
as
well
very
drinkable
a
little
bit
of
malty
sweetness
but
still
as
refreshing
as
a
good
pilsner
great
combination
of
maltiness
and
drinkability
good
color
and
good
carbonation
as
well
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
the
metallic
flavors
detracted
from
the
experience
for
me
the
low
abv
makes
it
go
down
easily
from
a
straight
taste
and
ease
standpoint
drinkability
is
high
as
a
maff
you
could
knock
these
puppies
ha
back
all
night
from
the
price
standpoint
it
runs
about
9
a
sixer
knock
the
price
down
about
a
1
50
per
sixpack
and
youve
got
a
higher
drinkability
score
d
much
more
refreshing
and
easier
to
drink
than
trois
pistole
but
that
is
an
apple
to
oranges
comparison
lets
just
say
that
on
a
hot
sweaty
night
like
this
one
this
beer
certainly
hits
the
proverbial
spot
overalli
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
it
this
was
a
really
well
balanced
lager
and
a
nice
introduction
to
two
brothers
i
hope
the
rest
of
their
beer
is
as
good
or
better
than
this
this
beer
was
left
at
my
place
after
a
bonfire
and
i
thought
it
would
go
good
with
my
wings
last
night
if
the
name
was
referring
to
the
dog
days
of
summer
and
the
fact
that
you
just
need
somethinganything
then
it
fit
but
otherwise
i
found
the
color
to
be
nice
transparent
gold
thin
white
head
that
disapated
quickly
the
taste
was
crisp
but
not
very
strong
which
may
have
gone
good
with
my
wings
but
i
drank
most
of
it
before
they
were
done
grillin
cause
i
wanted
to
get
on
to
the
next
beer
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
stronger
taste
to
go
with
the
good
color
maybe
something
to
remember
itself
by
d
its
a
very
easy
drinking
lager
ill
give
it
that
its
good
for
the
style
despite
its
very
lacking
head
and
touch
of
fruity
esters
good
flavor
but
shouldnt
be
there
two
brothers
never
disappoints
two
brothers
dog
days
poured
a
full
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
average
lacing
smell
was
loaded
with
hops
taste
was
crisp
with
malts
and
followed
by
a
mild
hop
bite
mouthfeel
was
good
for
the
style
drinkability
was
nice
as
well
overall
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
i
a
fan
of
this
style
ans
wish
more
brewers
offered
it
this
beer
is
good
for
a
summer
seasonal
beer
a
very
good
summertime
beer
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
one
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
typical
example
of
a
session
brew
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
yet
it
has
decent
enough
flavor
to
still
be
enjoyable
and
is
light
enough
to
throw
back
a
bunch
over
the
course
of
a
sitting
dnot
particularly
familiar
wthis
style
but
its
decent
easy
to
drink
pleasant
sessionable
overall
this
would
be
a
good
drink
on
a
summer
afternoon
with
fairly
low
abv
a
bit
schizophrenic
in
quality
and
in
the
end
boring
and
uninteresting
flavor
the
low
abv
is
nice
but
not
really
willing
to
drink
more
than
this
than
necessary
pours
an
bright
golden
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
grainy
malts
corn
and
noble
hops
flavor
is
malty
sweetness
initially
then
more
bready
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
creamy
texture
a
decent
helles
with
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
drinkability
ok
just
not
my
fav
this
beer
is
boring
worth
trying
if
you
like
moderately
flavored
beer
there
is
an
ittybitty
hop
bite
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
the
only
sign
of
life
in
the
beer
the
malts
get
more
apparent
as
it
warms
but
they
never
make
a
run
for
the
gold
as
a
side
note
every
beer
ive
yet
sampled
from
two
brothers
has
been
topnotch
drinkability
is
moderate
to
high
easily
sessionable
and
decent
flavors
makes
for
pretty
easy
consumption
this
style
in
general
lacks
complexity
and
is
uninspiring
which
limits
the
brew
slightly
drinks
down
very
easy
and
is
totally
quenchable
gone
in
no
time
flat
a
bit
more
length
and
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
this
would
make
for
a
easy
choice
as
a
regular
rotation
for
summer
brews
two
brothers
is
a
brewery
from
the
chicago
area
that
has
made
a
splash
here
in
new
york
city
with
its
wide
range
of
excellent
renditions
of
many
styles
of
beer
ale
and
lager
alike
while
this
is
far
from
the
first
of
their
beers
which
range
in
style
from
belgian
farmhouse
ales
to
this
dortmunder
style
lager
that
ive
tried
it
struck
me
that
two
brothers
has
really
outdone
itself
with
this
arguably
the
most
humble
style
it
has
tackled
dortmunder
style
lagers
were
amongst
the
first
german
lagers
to
be
consumed
en
masse
in
europe
a
german
take
on
the
czech
pilsen
beer
the
export
lager
version
of
this
beer
at
a
slightly
higher
abv
than
other
varieties
caught
on
and
eventually
molded
all
lagers
from
that
point
on
the
two
brothers
version
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
with
all
kinds
of
subtle
flavors
going
on
spicy
sweet
citrusy
and
more
mostly
though
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
tasty
beers
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
in
terms
of
sheer
drinkability
the
dog
days
beer
is
perfect
for
summer
days
where
you
want
your
beer
to
have
some
real
flavor
but
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
and
you
dont
want
to
be
praying
for
death
the
next
morning
this
has
all
of
those
qualities
and
it
pours
a
beautiful
perfectly
carbonated
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
all
the
smells
you
could
hope
for
in
a
beer
an
excellent
take
on
an
underinvestigated
style
and
another
winner
for
two
brothers
no
trouble
finishing
this
one
but
wouldnt
grab
another
either
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
it
i
am
again
impressed
by
these
guys
very
good
americandortmunder
style
nice
job
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
will
revisit
not
bad
fairly
smooth
worth
trying
though
its
nothing
overwhelming
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
very
thin
white
head
nose
is
bready
flavor
is
tangy
sweet
a
bit
kind
of
too
much
a
bit
bready
on
the
flavor
as
well
but
the
sweet
tang
just
overpowers
things
here
feel
is
decent
as
is
the
drinkability
this
is
okay
not
something
id
go
for
again
but
hey
nice
to
try
dog
days
is
bright
clear
and
lemony
gold
with
a
fuzzy
white
cap
it
features
light
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
earthygrassy
lightly
spicy
noble
hops
in
both
smell
and
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
oily
creamy
considering
its
relatively
light
body
it
is
a
very
well
done
dortmunder
style
lager
these
two
brothers
continue
to
impress
me
with
their
beers
a
nice
lighttomedium
body
certainly
quite
sessionable
and
worthy
of
firkining
dgood
quaffer
on
a
hot
day
refreshing
if
unremarkable
d
this
was
our
first
stop
on
my
bachelor
party
microbrewery
pub
crawl
and
most
of
my
buddies
drank
this
since
they
are
weirded
out
by
most
craft
brews
a
basic
but
satisfying
lager
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
lager
thanks
to
unclejedi
drinkability
needlessly
bland
cmon
even
the
humble
dortmunder
lager
can
shine
and
sparkle
if
you
allow
it
to
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
okay
its
somewhat
drinkable
i
just
think
its
a
bit
hohum
for
a
session
theres
much
better
choices
on
the
market
overall
its
okay
nothing
spectacular
aroma
is
fresh
and
malty
some
slight
citrus
hints
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
true
to
style
a
good
malty
crisp
light
beer
for
a
warm
day
it
has
mostly
malty
elements
with
just
the
slightest
hop
finish
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
i
have
now
tried
a
few
by
two
brothers
and
i
think
they
are
definitely
a
good
up
and
coming
craft
brewery
but
the
taste
that
sour
dough
ball
of
bread
just
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
and
ive
now
had
several
dorts
even
the
lasting
finish
with
some
caramel
cant
pull
this
one
over
to
my
list
of
beers
i
like

and
thats
saying
a
lot
but
i
wont
down
grade
the
taste
score
just
because
of
it
maybe
if
this
was
cold
as
hell
and
served
on
a
hot
hot
august
day
hence
the
name
drinkability
this
is
not
bad
but
its
not
good
either
so
that
kills
off
sessionability
this
is
straw
to
apricot
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
white
head
and
lacing
vegetal
and
grassy
aromas
along
with
some
bready
caramel
notes
in
the
nose
really
smells
like
a
lager
taste
is
a
very
light
malt
sweetness
finished
up
with
german
hop
bitterness
metallic
twang
in
the
finish
light
in
body
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
a
good
lawnmower
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
mild
carbonation
smooth
kind
of
dry
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
definitely
goes
down
easily
and
is
enjoyable
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
very
mild
with
sweet
malts
and
faint
hops
taste
is
an
excellent
sweet
bread
very
malty
just
enough
hops
come
through
to
cleanse
the
sugary
taste
away
and
keep
it
from
being
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
very
good
not
too
light
very
drinkable
summer
beer
not
quite
a
lawnmower
beer
very
nice
dog
days
dortmunder
style
lager
beer
is
clearly
the
product
of
a
capable
craft
brewery
even
though
it
doesnt
quite
jibe
with
the
characteristics
that
i
like
to
see
in
a
dortmunder
i
can
see
how
plenty
of
people
might
like
it
not
terrible
but
nothing
real
impressive
in
my
book
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
14
white
head
over
the
clear
golden
brew
head
is
a
skim
of
bubbles
quickly
with
average
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
tart
with
a
light
sweetness
taste
is
pale
malts
upfront
balanced
with
sedate
hops
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
this
one
could
be
an
acceptable
dinner
beverage
with
most
any
meal
like
those
people
who
get
along
with
just
about
anyone
d
the
punch
of
hops
bitterness
doesnt
have
any
depth
and
the
malt
flavors
are
nice
and
fresh
but
very
faint
and
a
bit
hidden
behind
the
hops
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
it
smells
like
light
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
also
grainybreadiness
the
taste
is
mainly
a
malty
breadiness
with
a
light
hoppy
middle
and
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
the
beer
is
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
probably
down
quite
a
few
of
these
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
a
great
summer
beer
but
good
for
any
other
time
of
year
as
well
this
lager
pours
a
clear
honey
gold
body
with
a
small
white
that
deposits
some
patchy
lacing
aroma
is
toffee
maltiness
and
spicy
and
floral
noble
hops
well
carbonated
and
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
taste
is
crispy
biscuity
malts
and
a
substantial
floral
hops
bitterness
well
balanced
overall
and
a
very
drinkable
lager
style
that
would
be
ideal
for
a
session
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
love
fresh
beer
prosit
mk
md
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
well
balanced
between
sweet
and
bitter
very
easy
down
a
great
brew
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
relaxing
is
what
comes
to
mind
first
and
foremost
the
palate
of
this
beer
enhanced
my
mood
at
the
time
and
added
something
special
to
the
evening
i
thought
this
beer
was
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
good
summertime
brew
for
those
hot
and
humid
days
wonderful
a
simple
yet
delicious
beer
very
well
done
taste
is
malt
first
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
followed
by
some
good
wellbalanced
hops
yum
mouthfeel
is
neither
thick
nor
thin
which
seems
proper
i
get
some
carbonation
feel
on
the
lips
but
not
too
much
i
havent
been
drinking
a
lot
of
lagers
lately
and
havent
really
liked
the
ones
i
have
tried
but
this
one
is
good
definitely
an
easy
to
drink
brew
probably
the
only
lager
ive
had
that
id
want
to
drink
several
of
though
as
i
noted
lagers
havent
been
my
thing
of

its
ok
not

bad
i
tasted
the

very
faint

characteristics
werent
as
prominant
as
i
would
expect
in
a

and
a

i
like
it
but
the
next

i
want
a

im
going
for

not
ubercomplex

should
it
be

also

well

to
savor
the

almost
savory
like
enjoying
freshly

later
ya
have
to
swallow
and
then
its
time
for
another

sloshing

slurping

extract

clarity
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
nice
appetizing
aroma
fairly
malty
the
taste
is
very
nice
lightly
malted
with
more
than
a
little
taste
of
candy
the
label
says
caramel
but
thats
not
it
it
was
more
like
a
faint
taste
of
hard
butterscotch
candies
the
finish
is
cleaned
up
nicely
by
a
dusting
of
hops
as
pone
would
expect
from
a
summer
brew
this
is
light
and
refreshing
pick
it
up
if
you
have
the
chance
its
pale
golden
in
color
and
just
a
touch
hazy
the
aroma
is
mellow
spicy
hops
and
caramel
malt
theres
a
very
nice
maltiness
to
this
lager
which
surprised
me
the
spicy
hops
come
through
for
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
refresher
its
not
complicated
in
flavor
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
its
not
as
watery
as
most
lagers
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
it
went
up
to
87
degrees
today
and
this
six
pack
came
in
handy
head
is
big
and
foamy
color
is
clear
golden
aroma
is
next
to
nothing
dry
vegetalherbal
a
touch
floral
and
fresh
the
palate
is
quite
dull
lacks
any
kind
of
nuance
or
any
sort
of
spark
ill
be
the
first
to
label
me
a
nonlager
lover
but
this
just
has
nearly
nil
to
speak
for
itself
and
while
i
can
imagine
its
handiness
as
the
proverbial
lawnmower
beer
clean
malty
flavor
far
less
grainy
than
the
smell
indicates
a
touch
of
hop
in
the
swallow
but
otherwise
this
is
all
about
the
base
the
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
soured
cream
to
it
full
body
for
the
style
but
with
an
equally
high
carbonation
level
much
more
flavorful
than
a
typical
macro
we
should
all
be
so
lucky
to
have
cheap
beer
that
tastes
like
this
brewed
domestically
certainly
not
a
bad
dortmunder
but
very
boring
for
the
style
surprisingly
tasteless
a
very
light
beer
that
i
would
consider
germanys
coors
light
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
quickly
decimating
head
dab
export
has
barely
any
flavor
and
has
a
taste
that
i
would
describe
as
watery
and
light
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
supposing
you
can
get
a
fresh
and
canned
not
skunked
version
it
is
of
course
a
dortmunder
so
dont
expect
the
flavor
to
punch
you
in
the
face
nonetheless
it
is
a
wonderful
and
refreshing
beer
a
relatively
simple
but
perfectly
balanced
beer
just
as
the
style
should
be
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
pour
was
clear
dark
golden
with
a
great
white
fluffy
head
that
stayed
together
over
the
glass
the
smell
was
fresh
cut
grains
and
hay
with
a
bit
of
tinny
hops
the
taste
was
hay
and
strong
alcohol
almost
astringent
it
was
slightly
creamy
with
the
alcohol
staying
on
the
tongue
i
was
hoping
for
a
more

i
will
have

d
a
pretty
solid
example

but
id
like
to
see
more
bitterness
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
it
was
crisp
and
left
the
palate
satisfied
not
an
overly
interesting
beer
but
a
good
quencher
what
can
i
say
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was
a
strong
heiniken
the
taste
was
similer
but
body
and
mouthfeel
a
little
firmer
still
i
would
take
this
over
heiniken
any
day
this
was
my
first
dortmunder
export
and
i
would
love
to
try
others
and
compair

all

have

vauguely
resembles

weak
noble

in
the
aftertaste
grossly
unbalanced
light
bodied
and
somewhat

the
offsweetness
and
skunky

ruin
the

the

is
very
interesting
it
is
light
but
has
a
kind
of

quality
where
it
gradually
gets

i
like
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
im
just
not
in
love
with
this
style
im
likin
the
dortmunders
a
lot
and
this
is
a
good
example
much
more
noticeable
malt
flavor
than
a
pale
american
lager
just
a
little
more
taste

very
drinkable
but
too
tempting
to
slam
one
down
especially
after
an
evening
spent
cooking
chile
pork

for
the
homebrew
club
picnic
unfortunately
due
to
its
hopmalt
balance
and
whitegreengoldred
packaging
this
beer
bears
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
clausthaler

which
is
a
serious
buzzkill
for
a
while
it
had
a
cult
status
and
merchandising
like

could
be
purchased
today
it
is
only
available
as
a

in

as
far
as
i
know
my
advice
buy
it
at
one
of
the
harbor
shops
when
taking
the
ferry
from

to
scandinavia
drink
it

from

a

a

especially
for
the
price
found
a

appealing
mouthfeel

surprisingly
full

pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
few
strands
of
bubbles
there
is
a
light
foam
on
the
top
of
the
beer
strong
evervesance
of
dry
malts
and
dried
out
grass
lots
of
pilsner
malts
mixed
well
with
german
hops
to
balance
out
the
malts
and
bring
forth
the
dry
character
of
the
malts
a
little
too
dry
to
be
that
refreshing
but
sil
hits
the
spot
right
after
a
hard
days
work
and
your
waiting
for
dinner
to
finish
cooking
just
a
generic
alcohol
twang
with
a
smooth
almost
silky
backbite
that
does
nothing
could
see
drinking
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
something
over
a
budweiser
but
ill
spend
extra
money
on
better
beer
from
a
33
cl
can
this
one
has
a
huge
puffy
beautiful
white
head
the
head
isnt
incredibly
long
lasting
but
when
it
falls
it
does
leave
an
intricate
clinging
lace
the
color
is
a
deep
but
not
quite
rich
gold
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
perfumy
its
a
mixture
of
sweet
pale
malt
and
floral
hops
not
bad
the
taste
is
light
and
delicate
on
the
downside
its
a
bit
watery
great
balance
though
and
the
hops
have
present
a
nice
theme
through
the
beer
not
overly
bitter
but
they
have
a
nice
backdrop
in
every
part
of
the
sip
the
body
is
a
little
too
light
and
the
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
little
less
carbonated
than
it
needed
still
this
one
is
a
solidly
good
and
clean
dortmunder
worth
a
try
i
picked
this
up
planning
to
have
a
couple
or
so
over
the
course
of
an
evening
figuring
that
it
would
be
an
easy
style
to
session
yikes
this
is
embarrassing
coming
from
the
city
that
invented
the
style
as
ive
had
better
from
there
and
locally
one
is
plenty
lacking
and
more
unpleasant
than
not
from
a
12

as

the
theme
of
my
beers
this
week
seems
to
be
cheap
lagers
from
around
the
world
a
nice
drinkinking
beer
paired
well
with
a
grilled
chicken
sandwich
and
frues
enjoyed
with
my
pizza
lunch
in
siena
italy
i
found
it
a
great
dortmunder
classic
colour
deeper
in
golden
aroma
offers
some
pronouced
hop
notes
a
great
balance
between
malthop
character
carbonation
and
texture
very
agreeable
refreshing
and
full
of
taste
a
distinctly
dortmunder
and
clearly
defined
apart
from
standard
euro
lager
i
liked
it
alot
pours
a
golden

with
fizzy

aroma
is
a
faint
malty
lagerish
aroma
with
a
faint
whiff
of
herbal
hops
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
but
pretty
thin
and
unimpressive
the
taste
is
just
lacking
something
i
am
not
a
huge
lager
fan
so
that
does
affect
my
rating
overall
this
is
a
below
average
lager
that
i
have
no
interest
in
drinking
again

i
probably
could
down

mildly
hoppy
perhaps
with
a
little
yeast
followed
by
a
short
dry
finish
not
a
chart
buster
just
a
good
solid
every
day
brew
there
isnt
too
much
to
write
about
with
this
beer
it
serves
as
a
decent
thirst
quencher
and
i
suppose
its
a
good
value
since
the
bottles
are
slightly
larger
than
your
average
12
oz
bottles
average
all
around
ng
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
topped
by
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
of
bright
white
froth
the
retention
is
limited
however
and
it
drops
fairly
shortly
to
just
a
creamy
collar
and
some
lacy
surface
foam
the
nose
displays
a
mild
combination
of
delicate
grainy
malt
and
lightly
floral
gently
spicy
and
mildly
herbal
hops
its
clean
and
fresh
but
not
overly
impressive
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
for
the
dortmunder
style
and
its
gently
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
theres
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
flavor
although
like
the
body
it
seems
restrained
for
the
style
initially
the
malt
captures
your
attention
but
it
quickly
shifts
towards
floral
and
spicy
hop
flavors
and
a
rising
bitterness
it
finishes
quite
dry
but
not
lingering
very
nice
and
quite
refreshing
that
at
least
is
like
the
dortmunder
lagers
that
i
know
and
love
this
seems
almost
like
a
diet
version
of
the
style
with
the
overall
flavor
and
balance
deadon
but
not
the
full
level
of
malt
and
hops
required
its
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
if
youre
simply
looking
to
go
through
beer
after
beer
but
i
think
it
lacks
enough
in
overall
character
that
youd
soon
want
to
turn
to
something
with
a
little
more
oomph
id
suggest
this
as
a
good
summer
beer
during
a
game
of
horseshoes
or
when
tied
to
the
grill
with
a
yard
full
of
guests
otherwise
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
to
be
had
easy
pour
gave
no
head
but
if
you
slam
this
into
a
pilsener
glass
you
can
generate
a
pretty
impressive
froth
it
kind
of
went
downhill
from
there
aroma
was
a
nondescript
hint
of
brown
sugar
flavor
was
sugary
malt
with
hops
following
up
with
a
very
subdued
flat
bittering
mouthfeel
was
thin
bordering
on
watery
i
was
not
impressed
the
upside
umm
it
does
contain
alcohol
and
it
can
be
followed
by
something
else
german
pils
smooth
easy
drinking
sweet
malt
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
not
a
bad
lager
at
all
a
bit
better
than
your
usual
american
adjunct
lager
for
instance
quite
enjoyable
in
the
1l
stein
glass
okay
for
au53
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
o
this
beer
is
decent
while
none
of
the
flavors
are
going
to
wow
and
it
definitely
has
that
mass
produced
taste
it
hits
enough
on
all
the
right
notes
definitely
my
favorite
green
bottle
o
this
was
always
in
my
fatherinlaws
fridge
and
i
hated
it
so
much
but
coming
back
to
it
its
not
that
bad
id
rather
drink
something
else
but
its
not
as
terrible
as
i
remember
for
the
price
this
is
a
very
good
buy
will
be
getting
a
few
next
time

spot
of

style
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
super
thin
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
malts
mostly
with
a
light
sweet
candy
detection
as
well
a
light
slunky
smell
was
noted
which
is
common
from
beers
in
green
bottle
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
slightly
watereddown
and
thin
with
the
malt
coming
through
mostly
no
bitter
or
harsh
finish
though
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
brew
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
not
as
good
as
other
traditional
german
options
out
there
ill
be
back
for
more
oh
and
the
metallic
thing
get
over
it
overall
a
fine
dortmunder
and
a
very
pleasing
thirst
quencher
in
the
right
situation
poured
from
a
can
pale
yellow
with
quite
a
lot
of
white
foam
initially
but
things
quickly
settled
down
aroma
was
subtle
a
sweet
biscuit
malt
with
hints
of
fruity
herbal
hops
perhaps
a
bit
of
sour
candy
taste
was
surprisingly
sweet
malt
with
a
medicinal
sweet
spice
almost
like
candied
ginger
some
mineral
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
a
round
sweetness
persists
as
well
my
impression
is
that
the
residual
sugars
are
too
much
for
the
style
could
use
a
drier
finish
although
this
is
in
the
ballpark
under
carbonated
more
fizz
might
balance
things
and
lift
up
the
hops
othe
first
sip
is
fine
but
its
just
too
sticky
sweet
in
the
middle
to
drink
more
than
one
of
i
was
hoping
for
a
dryer
beer
golden
crystal
colored
beer
with
a
nice
compact
white
foam
that
lingers
for
a
while
malty
and
bready
aroma
a
hint
of
sweet
candies
can
be
smelled
it
tastes
maltybready
but
a
bit
of
acidity
is
present
wich
i
find
not
very
pleasant
bitterness
is
balanced
lightmedium
bodied
refreshing
beer
nothing
special
at
all
o
im
not
impressed
by
the
beer
of
world
fame
its
not
bad
dont
get
me
wrong
its
better
than
most
domestic
beers
but
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
this
is
quite
attractive
and
beery
but
that
cheap
grainy
sweet
flavor
and
the
awful
medicinal
aftertaste
take
away
the
pleasure
for
me
id
call
it
the
euro
adjunct
lager
whatever
claims
they
make
about
the
ingredients
rjt
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
prost
lampertland
d
while
the
green
bottle
certainly
played
a
role
in
me
not
enjoying
this
beer
i
cant
imagine
it
was
all
that
spectacular
to
begin
with
skunked
or
not
this
a
subpar
for
even
a
lager
musty
and
stale
and
basically
devoid
of
any
flavor
other
than
skunk
oh
well
o
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
think
that
it
is
a
little
better
from
the
can
than
when
i
have
had
it
from
a
bottle
tastes
fresher
o
even
though
i
describe
it
as
sweet
it
is
not
there
is
just
enough
sweetness
to
mellow
the
sulfur
and
give
the
malt
that
fresh
flavor
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
by
the
liter
overall
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
but
there
appears
to
be
a
bit
of
a
skunky
lightstruck
character
to
it
malt
is
a
bit
forward
with
some
adjunct
flavors
and
a
fair
representation
of
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
dab
original
has
a
amber
color
with
some
lighter
spots
here
and
there
alot
of
rising
bubbles
create
a
nice
looking
tan
but
unsturdy
head
that
fades
into
some
small
patches
no
lacing
from
this
the
smell
consists
of
grain
barley
hops
and
some
earthy
hops
the
hops
come
out
in
taste
a
bit
more
with
a
nice
sweet
malt
backdrop
and
light
floral
arrangements
some
bisquits
in
the
middle
with
yeast
taste
finishing
it
out
the
feel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
on
this
hot
day
a
bit
of
a
bite
from
the
carb
and
some
hop
taste
sticks
on
the
tounge
a
bit
all
in
all
a
beer
i
would
grab
if
i
needed
a
beer
overall
well
crafted
everyday
brew
that
can
satisfy
the
pickiest
of
drinkers
enjoy
because
i
definitely
did
salud
o
did
not
finish
and
not
among
the
best
of
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
the
head
is
a
half
in
of
bright
white
foam
that
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
corn
with
a
slight
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
touch
sweeter
than
the
aroma
but
it
is
more
of
an
adjunct
sweetness
than
a
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
watery
texture
and
aggressive
carbonation
overall
this
beer
tastes
more
like
an
adjunct
lager
than
a
dortmunder
and
its
not
even
a
good
adjunct
lager
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
o
nice
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
not
a
lot
to
this
one
o
this
is
a
fairly
basic
german
lager
has
some
nice
malty
flavours
but
its
nothing
special
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
as
i
think
the
malt
flavours
would
really
shine
through
o
good
drinking
beer
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
while
watching
your
favorite
sporting
event
or
shoveling
snow
or
before
a
power
nap
cheers
o
quite
honest
and
drinkable
beer
my
impression
was
something
between
a
german
pilsener
and
a
lager
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
will
never
have
this
agin
pours
light
smells
grainy
tastes
of
grain
lemon
and
vanishingly
light
bitterness
with
the
noble
grassy
hops
you
expect
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
light
low
body
but
good
carbonation
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
really
not
much
character
either
light
but
serviceable
happy
to
see
it
for
six
dollars
for
a
sixpack
every
so
often
at
the
store
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
lager
with
good
balance
i
would
reach
for
this
beer
on
hot
summer
days
and
to
accompany
straight
forward
german
cuisine
straw
yellow
after
being
poured
into
a
tulip
from
a
longneck
bottle
thin
head
quickly
dissipating
smells
clearly
grainy
some
rice
evident
very
crisp
and
flavorful
i
paired
it
with
dutch
cheese
and
it
did
very
well
perfect
amount
of
hopping
makes
it
a
well
balanced
brew
very
nice
lager
impressive
for
such
a
basic
export
lager
looks
great
with
super
lacing
and
a
longstanding
head
smell
is
the
least
impressive
with
a
hint
of
cerealrice
at
least
none
of
that
american
adjunct
corn
smell
the
taste
is
what
makes
it
with
a
refreshing
hint
of
grain
and
a
lingering
not
too
dry
finish
of
hops
bittersweet
in
a
most
desirable
way
rolls
on
the
tongue
smooth
and
luscious
enough
not
thin
what
a
bargain
enjoy
it
quickly
though
since
it
camps
out
in
green
bottles
one
of
the
better
lagers
out
there
loving
the
dortmunder
style
from
a
mighty
fine
brewery
olike
it
very
much
maybe
a
bad
can
but
only
a
bit
better
than
most
massproduced
lagers
o
i
didnt
have
that
bad
of
a
time
without
this
at
all
and
would
welcome
a
glass
of
this
on
draught
but
i
fear
the
bottled
and
shipped
version
lacks
a
little
easy
drinking
and
at
a
bargain
price
not
the
best
by
any
means
but
a
good
lager
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
no
bones
about
it
its
a
great
goto
lager
this
is
what
a
simple
light
lager
should
be
it
is
something
i
should
seek
out
for
repeats
and
to
have
on
hand
for
when
something
stronger
is
too
much
o
this
really
isnt
my
first
choice
fr
a
beer
but
for
what
it
is
its
very
easy
drinking
with
a
good
taste
making
this
liter
not
much
of
a
chore
worth
a
try
sometime
if
you
see
it
worth
a
try
as
a
prototypical
beer
but
i
suspect
that
this
beer
has
diminished
in
quality
over
the
decades
final
grade
3
51
an
acceptable
b
nothing
fancy
here
just
plain
ol
german
lager
goodness
i
havent
had
very
many
dortmunders
so
comparing
this
brew
to
others
of
its
type
is
difficult
for
me
but
as
far
as
german
lagers
in
general
go
this
is
a
respectable
offering
to
be
sure
its
worth
pointing
out
that
the
price
is
also
excellent
and
there
are
only
a
small
number
of
similar
imported
brews
that
i
would
consider
in
the
same
quality
vs
price
range
as
dab
original
id
avoid
the
silly
green
bottles
if
possible
but
other
than
that
drink
up
and
enjoy
this
is
just
a
fantastic
beer
and
im
so
glad
to
see
it
available
in
a
can
o
nothing
amazing
about
this
beer
but
its
refreshing
something
appropriate
for
a
big
mug
its
not
complex
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
for
a
reasonable
price
i
may
recommend
under
the
right
circumstances
final
thoughts
its
not
bad
compared
to
the
aal
i
would
thank
anyone
kindly
for
this
one
if
they
handed
it
to
me
at
a
aal
kind
of
party
bbq
whatever
while
i
dont
like
the
style
this
one
is
decent
and
acceptable
o
nothing
special
here
guess
its
alright
to
just
watch
a
game
with
but
i
wont
get
it
again
if
the
metallic
notes
werent
there
i
would
rate
this
higher
not
sure
what
produces
that
off
flavor
but
it
becomes
less
noticeable
after
the
first
few
sips
o
not
too
bad
it
goes
well
with
the
yard
work
ive
been
doing
refreshing
sat
down
at
the
bar
ordered
some
beer
and
relaxed
good
day
at
the
brauhaus
this
brew
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
very
light
lemon
zest
and
light
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
greens
flowers
and
light
rice
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
nearly
watery
feel
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
at
best
but
way
too
thin
and
watery
even
for
a
dortmunder
not
to
mention
the
meekness
of
the
flavors
and
scent
pours
a
very
clear
plae
yellow
color
and
a
white
head
of
foam
that
sticks
around
til
about
the
first
sip
and
thats
it
with
its
green
bottle
and
scent
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
heineken
the
scent
hints
at
cheap
grassy
grains
taste
is
rather
bland
and
light
in
texture
you
get
a
little
grain
taste
but
thats
about
it
rather
simple
finish
as
well
something
new
to
try
but
thats
about
all
pretty
boring
i
seem
to
remember
this
having
more
honey
notes
last
time
round
overall
i
like
this
beer
in
a
sense
that
it
seems
to
stay
true
to
its
purpose
whatever
that
means
not
quite
as
dry
as
a
standard
german
pils
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
a
czech
pilsner
and
not
quite
as
sweetmalty
as
munich
helles
it
seems
to
strike
a
nice
balance
overall
very
drinkable
dortmunder
lager
seems
to
me
to
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
come
back
to
when
wanting
a
german
lager
o
usually
i
like
dortmunders
quite
a
bit
but
this
wasnt
quite
my
favorite
o
i
want
to
like
this
beer
whether
from
nostalgia
or
the
fact
that
i
have
10
more
bottles
i
cant
say
but
there
seems
to
be
something
rather
lacking
compared
with
other
imports
and
fresher
micros
of
the
same
style
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
which
opens
for
an
aroma
of
citrus
and
dough
the
flavor
is
citrus
fruit
grassy
hops
and
some
vanilla
sweetness
from
the
malt
its
got
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
drinkable
dortmunder
dab
original
is
an
okay
beer
recommended
refreshing
and
quenching
beer
o
go
for
something
else
d
fits
the
style
fairly
well
not
much
to
speak
of
flavorwise
but
it
sure
quenches
your
thirst
in
the
heat
this
is
a
great
exemplar
of
this
style
im
just
not
sure
this
deserves
its
own
category
and
probably
wouldnt
earn
it
if
it
were
new
today
o
im
convinced
that
this
is
a
typical
euro
pale
lager
my
first
dortmunder
was
ayinger
jahrhundertbier
and
it
was
much
better
than
this
crap
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
nice
pleasant
very
drinkable
flavour
the
light
bitter
sweet
notes
set
it
apart
from
a
bunch
of
the
other
eurobeers
id
buy
this
beer
again
had
this
from
a
gift
pack
of
german
beers
that
a
friend
got
me
for
christmas
one
year
this
lager
is
on
the
more
hardy
side
its
got
a
nice
amount
of
grains
in
the
flavor
the
hops
are
almost
there
its
got
a
little
more
bitter
than
a
pilsner
golden
in
color
nice
head
for
a
little
while
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
not
a
terrible
beer
fairly
straightforward
easy
drinking
beer
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
lawnmower
beer
however
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
here
so
theres
not
a
lot
of
need
to
seek
this
out
or
pay
much
for
it
d
the
light
flavour
and
body
make
it
quite
drinkable
if
unremarkable
i
didnt
realize
it
was
in
a
green
bottle
when
i
first
saw
it
in
the
cooler
oh
well
it
of
course
had
a
hint
of
a
skunky
smell
and
flavor
that
im
not
a
fan
of
other
than
that
it
tasted
a
lot
like
an
aal
some
wheat
or
grain
flavor
with
a
bit
of
malt
very
lightbodied
beer
and
relatively
drinkable
t
pleasantly
surprised
that
it
was
more
of
a
crisp
pilsner
taste
than
an
american
macro
it
has
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
lite
but
has
a
flavor
to
it
perfect
for
consumption
md
pretty
nice
feel
just
fizzy
and
beery
drinks
real
easy
drinks
average
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
neither
does
it
particularly
stand
out
poured
a
2
head
which
dissipated
to
an
irregular
trace
golden
yellow
color
smell
and
taste
of
grain
mild
malt
a
basic
lager
almost
mistakable
for
an
american
adjunt
lager
the
only
really
distinguishing
aspect
to
me
is
a
little
saltiness
which
actually
reminds
me
a
little
of
lobster
lovers
beer
out
of
eastern
europe
in
fact
i
had
dab
with
a
shrimp
supper
and
it
matched
nicely
pours
an
ultraclear
light
goldenyellow
a
white
head
soon
turns
into
a
slightly
sticky
ring
virtually
no
carbonation
seen
smell
is
minerally
biscuit
with
a
touch
of
lemon
grass
taste
is
crisp
and
mouthfeel
is
fluid
slick
in
fact
something
about
this
brew
seems
a
bit
odd
but
it
is
tasty
enough
light
biscuit
combined
with
a
forward
sweet
hop
feel
drinkability
suitable
an
ok
beer
dvery
drinkable
but
very
similar
to
quite
a
few
beers
that
ive
had
before
served
on
tap
in
20oz
dab
mug
2
75
light
feels
good
may
be
refreshing
in
the
right
context
but
that
odd
chalky
aspiring
character
quality
gets
to
be
a
drag
turning
a
decent
if
pretty
mundane
beer
a
little
unpleasant
poured
a
330
ml
bottle
into
my
pilsner
glass
nice
skunky
eurolager
smell
better
than
most
eurolagers
plenty
of
bubbles
and
foam
anice
full
white
foam
with
some
peaks
and
valleys
mild
lacing
the
carbonation
lasts
for
a
while
malty
with
some
bitterness
in
a
good
way
light
golden
and
quite
clear
bubbles
never
stopped
light
bodied
and
refreshing
i
could
enjoy
as
a
session
in
the
spring
or
summer
in
spain
but
ill
have
to
wait
a
bit
cheers
drinkability
a
good
light
body
beer
for
quenching
thirst
16
oz
can
shared
with
a
friend
while
brewing
as
he
had
bought
some
and
i
had
never
tried
it
and
saw
it
in
his
fridge
pale
and
clear
with
a
fluffy
head
that
dies
pretty
fast
very
clean
beer
perfectly
drinkable
definitely
not
an
in
your
face
ultracharactered
beer
this
isnt
some
hop
monster
just
a
smooth
classic
example
of
its
style
that
would
make
an
easy
session
lager
well
done
stay
tuned
for
a
high
rdev
its
a
good
beer
but
id
opt
for
something
with
some
moretastier
flavour
when
reaching
for
this
type
of
canned
euro
lager
330
ml
bottle
pours
golden
with
a
lasting
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
and
sweet
bready
malt
light
creamy
body
nice
balance
of
grassy
floral
hops
biscuit
malt
and
grain
fill
the
mouth
nice
long
hoppy
finish
worth
to
try
brew
not
too
much
i
can
say
of
this
beer
nothing
special
but
not
bad
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
bottled
versions
but
on
tap
or
cask
it
is
decent
typical
white
head
and
yellow
body
pilsner
like
quality
with
less
advanced
hops
some
malts
in
the
finish
but
they
are
loose
and
watery
the
quality
has
definatly
suffered
over
the
years
but
still
not
awful
if
not
from
the
bottle
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
just
a
cheap
version
of
the
syle
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
beer
like
this
and
thats
with
friends
or
at
a
party
it
serves
its
purpose
well
just
dont
pay
too
much
for
it
pours
a
nice
gold
with
a
nice
fine
white
head
perfect
carbonation
smells
like
nice
hops
and
grains
tastes
slightly
metallic
and
slightly
watery
too
slight
bitterness
that
does
not
really
seem
pleasant
that
lingers
for
a
lifetime
on
the
tongue
and
after
a
while
you
wish
it
would
go
away
at
a
bar
i
work
at
everyone
thinks
this
is
an
amazing
brew
i
know
its
kinda
sad
but
i
guess
its
ok
if
there
isnt
any
better
beer
available
d
there
isnt
anything
special
here
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
if
i
want
a
solid
dortmunder
ill
go
for
a
gl
dortmunder
gold
edit
wow
looking
at
the
reviews
im
glad
i
got
this
from
a
can
i
appreciate
most
german
lagers
and

do
if
one
were
to
really
like
this
guy
one
could
drink
many
one
would
be
happy
i
am
not
the
one
if
i
were
to
keep
within
the

id
reach
for
a
great

gold
or
two
brothers
dog
days
maybe
im
just
partial
to
the
midwest
of
america
who
knows
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
bordering
on
to
light
even
making
its
drinkability
high
i
could
drink
this
all
night
refreshing
beer
with
a
light
body
d
decent
session
beer
if
you
like
this
style
you
could
drink
alot
of
it
if
you
could
find
a
reason
to
a
good
and
solid
german
lager

and
leaving

scent
is
muted
touch
of
grain
grass
and
potatolike
vegtableness
taste
is
a
little
better
then
the
scent
would
hint
at
a
somewhat
fresh
grainy
taste
with
noticeable
yeast
presenced
grassy
hop
presence
is
noted
but
very
minimal
and
a
slight
vegtablelike
presence
on
the
back
end
body
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
special
but
nothing
wrong
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
goes
down
quite
easy
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
truly
german
gem
of
a
beer
drinkability
its
well
over
90
here
so
im
in
about
the
best
position
this
beer
would
want
in
a
reviewer
it
is
extremely
refreshing
and
i
really
enjoy
the
flavor
i
just
wish
there
were
more
carbonation
so
i
could
really
say
aaahhhh
after
each
sip
dab
is
a
clean
palatable
quenching
german
lager
but
then
again
they
nearly
all
are
this
may
not
be
the
best
candidate
to
showcase
germanys
characteristically
high
quality
craftsmanship
but
it
does
still
speak
to
its
existence
a
beer
like
this
however
ordinary
it
may
be
is
still
leagues
better
than
what
most
commercial
north
american
brewers
offer
up
an
enjoyable
straightup
balance
of
grain
and
hop
with
just
enough
zip
to
keep
it
interesting
in
any
shall
i
have
another
dithering
nothing
complicated
just
a
solid
german
brew
for
what
its
worth
d
easy
to
drink
can
pound
these
down
pretty
well
although
i
dont
want
to
as
its
pretty
boring
per
the
style
its
pretty
close
but
without
a
few
tweaks
overall
its
only
average
a
little
more
malt
flavor
and
a
lot
more
carb
and
this
beer
gets
high

taste
and

is

i
bought
the
case
because
i
could
not
recall
the
last
taste
i
had
of
it
after
drinking
the
whole
case
myself
i
can
put
that
curiosity
behind
me
admit
that
the
import
was
basicand
serviceable
but
not
the
beer
of
world
fame
the
bottle
boasts
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
milder
germanstyle
beer
that
is
worth
pounding
down
for
a
long
time
if
your
options
are
limited
well
now
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
ihlncs
dortmunder
of
late
so
i
am
anxious
to
see
how
this
compares
and
vice
versa
oh
the
nose
was
immediate
the
scent
of
quality
malted
barely
took
no
time
in
wafting
around
my
kitchen
zounds
i
had
two
fingers
worth
of
dense
bonewhite
head
sitting
atop
the
beer
the
beer
itself
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
one
good
sniff
and
i
was
transported
to
a
grain
mill
room
at
any
of
the
better
brewpubs
this
was
tworow
barley
malted
to
produce
a
sweet
smell
unlike
any
other
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
great
dryness
brought
on
by
the
hops
mentioned
on
the
can
it
suddenly
struck
me
just
how
good
a
brewer
we
have
in
paul
rutherford
at
ihlnc
i
might
be
hardpressed
to
tell
the
diffeence
in
a
blind
sidebyside
finish
had
a
characteristic
lagerlike
sweetness
it
is
difficult
to
quantify
but
when
you
put
a
quality
lager
next
to
an
american
macrolager
it
becomes
easy
to
see
what
a
pale
imitation
most
americans
are
drinking
on
a
routine
basis
this
was
very
good
definitely
merits
consideration
for
the
cooler
this
is
the
first
lager
ive
had
in
awhile
that
didnt
have
a
bad
aftertaste
and
was
quite
refreshing
the
first
half
of
the
pint
went
easy
and
the
last
half
bored
me
i
was
ready
to
be
done
this
would
work
as
pizza
or
burger
beer
but
not
as
a
sitdown
pint
some
flaws
and
some
neat
things
as
well
i
wont
refuse
one
but
wont
seek
this
either
kinda
ok
beer
pours
with
a
light
golden
color
with
a
good
head
it
has
a
malt
aroma
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
is
slightly
sweet
it
has
mild
carbonation
with
a
clean
refreshing
feeling
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
great
when
having
more
than
12
nice
drink
drink
on
social
ocassions
drinkability
is
pretty
good
pours
a
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
left
minimal
to
no
lacing
the
nose
has
straw
and
a
bit
of
malt
in
it
nothing
special
here
edit
a
spicy
almost
cinnamon
aroma
dominates
initially
the
beer
itself
is
moderately
better
than
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
that
makes
it
clean
and
easy
to
drink
for
the
average
macro
drinker
bubbly
but
not
overly
and
a
beer
i
would
consider
reaching
for
if
i
felt
the
need
for
a
crsip
clean
nonhoppy
beer
as
rare
as
that
is
smooth
pilsner
great
session
beer
very
good
beer
for
heavy
or
spicy
meals
golden
in
color
smooth
in
drinkability
very
low
carbonation
would
definitely
order
again
with
a
meal
or
just
as
a
nice
light
beer
looking
forward
to
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
warmer
weather
another
mega
foreign
pilsner
malt
bomb
okay
maybe
im
not
sure
this
is
the
greatest
thing
i
am
growing
to
like
pils
more
but
not
this
much
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
good
its
something
i
could
drink
again
but
i
would
rather
have
a
different
dortmunder
however
after
drinking
it
again
a
few
days
later
i
liked
it
better
i
think
this
might
grow
on
me
the
body
is
what
is
expected
from
this
style
of
beer
smooth
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
is
of
course
very
good
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
try
this
if
youre
not
familiar
with
the
style
f
t
a
step
above
heineken
and
stella
not
as
trendy
though
one
great
lager
nothing
to
hate
nor
love
usually
priced
a
little
lower
than
most
germandanish
imports
maybe
owing
to
the
11
2
oz
bottles
has
the
german
taste
but
not
the
mouthfeel
maybe
its
the
water
in
dortmund
or
the
grains
it
def
has
a
bit
of
a
grainy
taste
they
are
also
transparent
on
the
marketing
front
no
advertising
or
promotion
that
i
can
detect
so
im
not
sure
what
their
trip
is
positionwise
not
bad
for
a
12pack
here
and
there
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
curse
trader
joes
for
discontinuing
beer
sales
in
my
area
they
had
stuff
twice
as
good
as
dab
at
a
fraction
of
the
price
coppergolden
color
with
a
nice
fresh
bread
smell
there
is
a
bit
of
caramel
slight
citrus
rind
and
spiciness
in
the
flavor
all
in
all
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
off
and
tends
to
be
a
bit
grainy
and
leaves
a
slightly
too
bitter
somewhat
thick
aftertaste
i
cant
knock
this
beer
because
it
is
good
but
i
cant
rave
about
it
either
a
decent
german
import
but
i
think
a
bit
average
in
its
class
its
the
aftertaste
that
kills
any
chance
of
greatness
it
just
doesnt
wash
down
all
that
well
and
the
bitterness
lingers
around
well
past
its
welcome
d
fine
goes
down
easy
good
for
beer
newbs
an
easy
drinkable
macro
but
sadly
boring
type
of
beer
i
wouldnt
normally
seek
out
and
but
was
given
to
me
by
a
family
member
during
the
holidays
pours
with
little
head
semisee
through
golden
color
to
it
aroma
is
a
bit
musky
maybe
this
one
is
a
bit
dated
taste
lacks
any
carbonation
starting
to
think
this
is
a
tainted
bottle
typical
massexported
euro
lager
taste
to
it
light
bodied
and
pretty
tasteless
except
for
a
weak
euro
hop
kick
to
it
at
the
end
pretty
sure
i
wouldnt
enjoy
this
one
even
if
it
wasnt
super
fresh
look
elsewhere
for
a
nice
import
taste
a
little
prickly
tiny
probably
hallertau
hops
or
something
similar
light
body
mouthfeel
remains
this
way
drinkability
sure
not
annoying
easy
to
drink
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
the
sun
skunks
it
making
it
even
better
imho
truthfully
i
only
picked
this
up
because
i
have
yet
to
try
a
dortmunder
and
um
lets
just
say
it
didnt
exactly
make
me
want
to
explore
the
style
any
further
i
think
this
beer
is
a
little
underrated
perhaps
it
keeps
fresher
in
cans
than
in
bottles
either
way
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
a
dab
anytime
mouthfeeldrink
light
bodied
medium

smooth
to
drink
this
is
my
first
tiime
drinking
dortmunders
not
a
whole
lot
of
good
or
bad
to
say
its
fine
hits
the
spot
when
i
want
something
simple
but
there
are
other
continental
lagers
id
gladly
take
ahead
of
it
still
not
a
bad
choice
and
not
a
hard
beer
to
down
en
masse
dab
original
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
has
a
bit
of
sulphur
if
this
didnt
come
out
of
a
can
i
would
wonder
if
it
was
skunked
there
is
some
sweetness
as
well
as
a
hint
of
floral
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
light
some
light
dry
maltiness
coupled
with
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
grainy
tannin
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
no
after
taste
mid
body
beer
adequate
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
a
good
one
none
the
less
a
tasty
sweet
pilsner
that
tastes
of
honey
and
biscuits
with
perhaps
nuts
and
grains
thin
but
certainly
very
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
a
decent
pilsner
under
2
bucks
a
can
you
could
certainly
do
worse
pours
a
golden
straw
colored
yellow
decent
carbonation
has
somewhat
of
a
nutty
taste
to
it
yet
it
tastes
along
the
same
lines
of
all
the
other
great
tasting
german
beers
ive
come
to
really
appreciate
while
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
with
this
beer
for
the
price
19case
and
the
ease
of
drinkability
id
say
this
is
one
heck
of
a
beer
this
beer
pours
yellowgold
in
color
and
is
clear
for
aroma
i
got
maltiness
and
an
unexpected
skunkiness
with
a
slightly
floral
note
as
for
taste
there
was
a
light
to
medium
body
a
nice
bit
of
maltiness
and
the
ever
prescent
underlying
skunkiness
green
bottle
at
least
there
was
the
expected
rounded
sweetness
i
normally
associate
with
this
style
and
a
touch
of
hops
was
a
nice
surprise
on
the
finish
however
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
but
it
is
not
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
green
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
slightly
skunky
taste
is
crisp
but
a
bit
bland
some
notes
of
malt
and
hops
fells
light
in
the
mouth
goes
down
very
easy
a
good
beer
for
a
drinking
games
overall
a
decent
brew
the
dab
poured
fantastically
from
the
minikeg
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thick
tight
head
the
head
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
nice
lace
pattern
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
sweet
malty
bread
over
powered
any
hops
that
were
present
dab
had
more
mouth
than
i
was
expecting
i
thought
it
would
be
as
thin
as
an
american
pilsner
but
was
slightly
thicker
i
was
slightly
surprised
at
the
taste
it
was
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
no
hop
presence
at
all
the
malts
dominate
like
raw
bead
dough
the
finish
leaves
a
malty
after
taste
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
but
it
was
more
than
i
expected
light
bodied
and
spritzy
but
not
overly
thin
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
d
very
light
and
somewhat
forgettable
lager
they
go
down
like
water
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
pale
golden
with
a
fine
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
collar
of
foam
the
nose
is
toasted
grain
lemon
and
euro
hops
the
flavor
is
barley
heavy
almost
reminiscent
of
grape
nuts
cereal
with
noble
hop
and
lemon
bitterness
in
the
mostly
clean
finish
smooth
and
light
bodied
an
easy
drinking
brew
for
sure
try
it
not
too
shabby
anyhow
dimpled
mug
frothy
head
golden
body
the
foam
lasts
forever
and
the
beer
takes
a
good
half
hour
to
kill
sort
of
a
honeyish
pale
malt
flavor
sweet
ritz
cracker
minus
the
butter
no
hops
crisp
and
clean
so
important
and
signature
to
a
german
lager
fuller
than
your
average
lager
and
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
nobrainer
type
malted
beverage
it
pairs
so
well
with
the
house
reuben
here
give
it
a
try
drinkability
not
really
my
thing
but
if
you
like
macro
brews
you
could
probably
knock
back
these
without
much
complaint
drinkability
its
not
complex
but
its
a
good
drinking
beer
id
say
its
a
decent
lager
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
finger
of
very
fluffy
white
head
nice
floral
hops
aromasaaz
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
however
i
seem
to
remember
dortmunders
being
a
bit
darker
and
maltier
than
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
drinkability
as
i
indicated
in
my
other
review
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
putting
away
a
few
of
these
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
more
than
25
years
i
remember
when
this
was
a
really
big
deal
import
that
was
border
line
exotic
my
how
things
have
changed
the
beer
pours
a
straw
colored
pale
with
a
nice
slightly
foamy
white
head
retains
okay
a
touch
of
lacing
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
a
very
light
sweet
malt
lager
the
taste
is
very
light
very
refreshing
very
simple
and
pretty
much
a
run
of
the
mill
lager
the
only
real
distinguishing
characteristic
is
that
it
does
have
a
slightly
more
assertive
grassy
hop
bite
than
most
other
lagers
it
is
herbal
has
some
lemony
citrus
to
it
has
some
leafy
hop
underneath
but
is
predominently
a
grassy
and
herbal
lager
with
a
sweet
malt
character
and
a
bit
of
a
tart
flavor
towards
the
finish
whats
not
to
like
but
then
again
whats
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
either
luckily
the
taste
does
not
suffer
this
flaw
really
rich
and
creamy
this
is
like
a
oktoberfest
light
tastes
and
feels
like
a
very
authentic
german
beer
and
takes
me
back
to
my
days
in
germany
i
just
cracked
open
the
2nd
and
the
its
much
better
though
not
as
crisp
and
dry
as
i
would
like
but
better
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
decent
session
beer
not
complex
not
much
to
it
if
you
enjoy
macro
lagers
this
is
the
import
for
you
find
a
cheap
case
for
yourself
not
bad
but
too
much
for
the
price
i
think
i
like
the
dortmunder
style
not
the
best
german
lager
ive
had
but
it
was
a
decent
price
at
under
8
per
six
pack
plus
i
havent
really
had
many
dortmunders
to
compare
to
nicely
light
and
drinkable
with
a
flavor
profile
reminiscent
of
a
maibock
but
without
the
heavier
mouthfeel
associated
with
said
style
certainly
separated
from
the
pilsners
that
so
dominated
the
german
market
today
this
is
a
nicely
distinctive
style
and
a
good
drinker
d
strange
brew
something
not
right
about
this
one
i
would
have
assumed
maybe
it
was
stored
improperly
but
im
an
optimist
unpleasant
finish
is
a
downfall
but
at
least
it
looks
good
comment
it
seems
that
the
less
taste
the
more
refreshing
and
this
is
the
same
there
isnt
a
really
strong
taste
to
it
but
it
is
pretty
refreshing
if
the
bitterness
didnt
stick
around
as
it
does
it
might
be
even
better
in
the
summer
dab
is
a
clear
light
golden
lager
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
it
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
funky
fruity
aroma
its
pretzely
and
it
smells
very
german
it
is
mediumlight
bodied
a
little
bubbly
but
smooth
with
a
crisp
finish
it
tastes
funky
and
fruity
pretty
sweet
and
pretty
inoffensive
there
is
a
slight
lemonpepper
note
in
the
finish
its
some
easy
drinking
overall
i
took
advantage
of
a
warm
latewinter
day
to
give
this
a
try
i
cant
really
say
anything
bad
about
this
one
maybe
i
wasnt
wowed
but
its
solid
all
the
same
grpunkfeb

even
though
it
seems
to
hit
all
the
notes
for
the
style
it
looks
great
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
easily
slam
these
tallboy
cans
all
night
refreshing
aftertaste
very
good
after

not
a

you
can

and
this

one
of
them
super
clean
and
crisp

with
some
character
unlike

i
prefer

to
this

either
would
be
absolutely
perfect
as

for

just
enough

this
is
a
wonderful
beer

smells
great
and
has
a
nice
full
malt
taste
with
just
enough
hoppy
bitterness
one
of
my
all

favorites
overall
a
really
tasty
lager
that
is
clean
crisp

very

quite

super
drinkable
i
like
it
a

kudos
to
great

for
this
one
as
i
was
not
a
fan
of
their
ipas
but
damn
this
is
such
a
great
product
this
is
a
tremendous
lager
very
possible
that
i
have
just
found
my
perfect
goto
beer
very
versatile
and
perfect
all
around
overall
a
very
good
lager
and
worth
working
into
a
constant
rotation
perfectly
balanced
german
style
beer
refreshing
and
delicious
one
of
the
best
beers
we
have
had
in
years
pretty
good
beer
for
great
lakes
overall
this
was
a
good
lager
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
dont
remember
it
being
as
hoppy
or
having
any
spiciness
to
it
but
still
this
was
a
good
lager
o
not
complex
but
super
enjoyable
clean
crisp
and
delicious
definitely
recommend
a
very
well
balanced
lager
good
color
and
nice
lacing
i
enjoyed
the
overall
flavor
and
could
throw
a
couple
of
these
back
anytime
im
no
expert
on
this
style
but
this
is
good
and
enjoyable
this
beer
about
approaches
perfection
a
very
smooth
light
and
refreshing
beer
not
overly
hoppy
or
bitter
fantastic
easy
to
drink
beer
perfectly
balanced
lots
of
hops
but
not
too
bitter
overall
a
well
balanced
and
very
interesting
lager
nice
complexity
quite
smooth
as
well
a
must
try
well
done
by
great
lakes
o
not
my
favorite
lager
to
be
honest
but
this
is
also
not
my
favorite
lager
style
the
earthen
noble
hops
are
present
enough
to
obscure
some
of
the
other
flavors
for
me
and
the
malt
tones
are
less
biscuit
more
bread
and
grain
to
me
i
usually
avoid
this
one
and
the
occasional
revisit
reinforces
to
me
why
i
do
o
very
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
with
a
bit
more
depth
bitterness
compliments
the
malts
used
very
well
a
fine
easy
drinking
lager
with
good
complexity
o
a
darker
and
tastier
than
average
lager
which
more
than
holds
up
as
it
warms
eventually
becoming
a
nice
sipper
fantastic

beautiful

when
i
do

this
is
a
truly
incredible
beer
though
i
try
to
avoid
using
the
word
drinkability
i
cant
dodge
it
here
thankfully
however
drinkability
with
this
beer
does
not
mean
tastelessness
or
watered
down
flavor
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
very
drinkable
and
true
to
the
style
i
would
down
a
couple
after
cutting
the
grass
on
a
hot
summer
day
everyone
has
beer
styles
that
they
like
more
or
less
than

me

there

this

better

my

it
is

its
like

it
pissed
out
the
most

of

its

i
just
hope
someone
else
sees
it

aroma
doesnt

go
with

it

has
a

with
only
slight

malt
is
a
touch
grainy
though
not

much
good
body
and
mouthfeel
which
is
appropriate
for
a

maybe
the
best
of
the

offerings
i
had
the
the
dortmunder
gold
recently
on
tap
at
a
seafood
restaurant
outside
of
cleveland
was
skeptical
since
it
had
been
a
couple
years
since
i
had
had
it
but
this
beer
is
still
as
world
class
as
it
was
before
i
knew
what
good
beer
was
if
you
grew
up
with
great
lakes
you
grew
up
spoiled
overall
waited
too
long
to
try
this
delicious
beer
o
this
is

no
one
should
ever
thumb
their

at

the
color
of
this
brew
is
nice
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
appearance
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
smooth
and
rich
at
first
at
the
end
there
is
a
little
bit
of
of
bite
the
bite
is
a
nice
finish
to
this
brew
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
a
good
drinking
brew
no
bad
after
tease
or
anything
over
powering
this
brew
is
all
around
a
good
brew
smooth
tasting
with
a
bite
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
5
out
of
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
overall
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
it
has
wonderful
flavor
yet
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
paired
very
well
with
my
gourmet
bacon
cheeseburger
o
this
was
a
really
good
beer
it
was
super
refreshing
light
but
with
strong
flavors
and
had
wonderful
balance
i
would
have
no
problem
making
this
a
regular
if
it
were
easier
for
me
to
get
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
a
simple
but
awesome
pilsner
by
an
always
reliable
brewery
theres
nothing
super
extravagant
about
this
beer
but
its
pegged
down
the
basics
and
its
done
it
well
personally
i
could
drink
this
all
day
its
so
smooth
and
good
if
youre
wanting
to
get
into
the
pilsner
style
start
here
o
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
pair
well
against
something
bitter
like
some
brussels
sprouts
or
similar
my
socks
arent
exactly
knocked
off
but
its
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
style
great
lakes
is
probably
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
us
o
i
really
like
this
brew
when
its
a
nonleek
day
for
me
see
above
not
an
always
onhand
goto
brew
for
me
but
i
will
rotate
it
into
the
fridge
now
and
again
for
variety
overall
i
can
understand
why
this
is
glbc
flagship
beer
an
amazing
golden
lager
from
start
to
finish
balanced
and
so
super
smooth
i
have
had
this
so
many
times
and
will
continue
to
however
as
amazing
as
it
is
i
do
like
other
glbc
brews
more
this
brew
is
simple
yet
complex
if
that
makes
any
sense
so
it
appeals
to
more
people
after
all
this
is
the
very
first
craft
brew
i
ever
drank
this
beer
is
a
winner
for
me
it
has
a
flavor
profile
that
i
wasnt
used
to
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
grew
to
really
like
perfect
for
relaxing
with
after
a
long
day
of
work
fortunately
i
live
in
lakewood
ohio
which
borders
clevelands
west
side
the
great
lakes
brewery
is
about
15
minutes
from
my
house
this
beer
is
available
on
tap
at
almost
all
restaurants
in
the
area
and
thank
god
for
that
ive
been
honing
my
beer
pallete
for
a
few
years
now
tried
many
types
of
lagers
and
this
is
hands
down
the
best
there
is
no
rival
overall
big
fan
of
this
one
wish
i
had
access
to
this
in
my
area
great
example
of
this
style
o
amazingly
sessionable
the
mild
but
the
clear
flavors
are
immediately
accessible
without
any
offensive
notes
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
simply
remarkable
perfectly
sippable
perfect
beer
to
share
a
few
rounds
with
friends
a
good
lager
and
extremely
traditional
as
it
holds
to
the
style
dortmunder
gold
pours
a
hazy
dark
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
cheap
grain
like
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
strong
biscuit
flavor
nice
full
flavors
enjoyable
great
body
nice
feel
overall
its
very
good
enjoyable
and
has
a
spring
like
flavor
was
not
expecting
this
much
this
is
a
great
beer
and
may
be
my
favorite
lager
on
the
market
for
me
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
macro
to
micro
changeover
for
anybody
with
a
friend
who
drinks
crap
bmc
stuff
it
is
great
with
almost
any
food
type
and
just
delicious
on
its
own
anyone
who
does
not
like
this
just
does
not
like
beer
period
perfection
it
a
bottle
final
thoughts
i
went
into
this
one
with
little
to
no
expectations
and
am
impressed
maybe
not
a
beer
that
would
ever
be
in
high
demand
but
a
good
example
of
how
satisfying
a
lager
can
be
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
outstanding
beer
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
lager
o
this
beer
and
i
go
way
back
it
was
my
first
serious
foray
into
the
world
beyond
yellow
pisswater
i
think
ive
actually
grown
a
bit
colder
to
it
over
time
still
a
great
lager
o
a
really
nice
balance
of
citrusy
sweetness
and
dry
earthy
flavors
a
topnotch
lager
for
sure
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
dare
i
say
the
end
all
to
dortmunders
perhaps
it
is
certainly
my
personal
favorite
of
the
style
recommend
to
any
and
all
this
is
a
great
tasting
german
style
lager
it
has
a
beautiful
golden
appearance
with
minor
lacing
and
a
one
finger
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
mildly
fruity
this
beer
has
more
taste
than
most
lagers
and
it
lasts
on
your
tongue
ill
be
keeping
this
beer
stocked
regularly
o
not
the
sexiest
style
but
a
great
representation
great
lakes
hit
the
spot
with
this
puppy
its
very
bland
im
getting
very
little
taste
out
of
it
and
its
a
little
to
dry
not
worth
12
i
really
expected
more
from
great
lakes
it
kinda
spoiled
my
taste
for
a
lager
and
im
going
to
move
to
an
ale
now
a
fantastic
lager
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
it
and
i
plan
to
drink
a
lot
more
of
this
in
warmer
weather
i
am
amazed
by
how
well
great
lakes
does
so
many
different
styles
i
cant
think
of
another
brewery
that
does
such
different
beers
so
well
lagers
ales
light
dark
this
one
certainly
upholds
that
reputation
overall
a
great
lager
to
sip
on
any
time
of
year
perhaps
also
a
good
one
to
give
to
those
who
typically
enjoy
their
light
beers
im
becoming
more
of
a
great
lakes
fan
every
beer
i
try
from
them
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
light
and
airy
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
and
leave
excellent
lacing
smell
is
what
you
would
expect
of
an
amber
lager
taste
is
balanced
well
but
lacks
complexity
the
star
are
the
barley
and
hops
it
does
have
that
bitter
aftertaste
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
smooth
overall
well
brewed
lager
but
i
cant
say
i
must
have
another
one
overall
this
is
an
excellent
lager
nicely
balanced
very
delicious
and
very
refreshing
just
an
excellent
lager
o
had
some
high
expectations
given
what
ive
read
about
this
beer
here
and
must
say
i
was
not
disappointed
it
is
a
lager
but
i
do
enjoy
those
that
add
some
dry
bitterness
to
the
crisp
start
almost
medium
bodied
medium
effervescence
is
sharp
initially
but
drops
almost
instantly
a
tangy
almost
metallic
note
remains
somewhat
acidic
no
knock
on
the
beer
as
i
bought
this
nearly
a
year
ago
ill
write
it
off
as
an
effect
of
age
for
a
lager
this
is
seriously
good
brew
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
say
it
lived
up
to
the
dortmunder
name
it
seemed
worthy
to
stand
up
to
beers
in
a
pub
in
germany
the
taste
had
a
bitter
edge
without
the
grapefruit
citrus
tone
prominent
in
many
american
ipas
it
did
not
have
as
much
depth
or
profundity
as
some
craft
beers
have
my
call
is
88
out
of
100
a
great
lager
the
perfect
lager
a
nice
rich
golden
color
good
tall
head
but
it
did
dissipate
rather
quickly
good
flavor
a
sweetness
but
not
actually
sweet
tasted
the
malt
smooth
with
a
crispness
to
finish
had
an
almost
hay
flavor
mixed
in
there
wonderful
lager
very
impressed
bright
transparent
gold
color
with
small
white
head
and
a
little
messy
lacing
aroma
has
crisp
bready
malts
with
very
light
citrus
hops
flavor
is
mostly
malts
with
a
bit
of
hops
light
and
refreshing
with
no
bitterness
very
smooth
and
balanced
with
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
think
even
six
or
so
years
after
first
trying
this
dortmunder
gold
remains
my
only
experience
with
the
style
based
on
how
good
this
beer
is
a
and
the
awards
its
won
im
not
too
upset
that
this
is
the
lone
representative
of
the
style
for
me
as
advertised
it
is
a
gorgeous
gold
beer
that
falls
between
a
pilsner
and
a
vienna
lagger
in
terms
of
flavor
profile
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
work
excellently
together
to
create
a
beer
that
is
both
highly
drinkable
yet
complex
i
will
undoubtedly
get
this
again
next
time
i
am
in
ohio
o
a
really
good
interpretation
of
a
germanstyle
beer
absolutely
great
not
complicated
but
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
rjt
taste
is
full
toasty
bread
hay
esp
in
finish
strong
herbal
hop
character
complex
zesty
engaging
fullbodied
and
firm
of
character
it
has
a
creamy
yet
lively
full
feel
that
retains
lightness
very
good
nice
taste
definitely
worth
repeating
o
this
has
vaulted
to
the
top
of
my
lager
listings
im
not
wellenough
versed
in
the
style
to
say
whether
or
not
this
is
a
great
example
but
it
hits
every
note
perfectly
for
me
i
honestly
dont
get
the
comments
ive
seen
in
some
reviews
comparing
this
to
an
aal
it
is
so
much
more
flavorful
and
sophisticated
than
anything
being
put
out
by
the
big
three
im
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
get
around
to
trying
this
one
given
the
great
experience
ive
had
with
every
other
great
lakes
beer
but
this
will
now
become
a
regular
fixture
in
my
fridge
my
great
lakes
winning
streak
continues
ive
yet
to
have
one
of
their
beers
i
havent
loved
one
of
the
lagers
made
in
the
us
just
all
around
tasty
and
well
balanced
im
not
a
big
lager
drinker
and
tend
to
buy
this
only
when
i
have
guests
who
prefer
lighter
styles
but
every
time
i
drink
it
im
impressed
great
looking
golden
beer
with
a
fairly
powerful
sweet
malty
scent
taste
is
similar
and
complemented
by
a
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
to
serve
to
your
buddrinking
pals
or
to
guzzle
down
after
a
round
of
golf
my
first
dive
into
the
craft
world
was
surprisingly
exceptional
this
beer
hits
the
palate
smoothly
and
finishes
with
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
its
quite
crisp
it
has
the
most
desirable
level
of
carbonation
per
my
tastebuds
now
this
bottle
is
a
staple
brew
at
my
place
o
a
clean
flavorful
balanced
extremely
drinkable
lager
no
doubt
this
is
something
i
would
buy
again
for
any
occation
this
would
even
be
a
great
gateway
beer
for
someone
looking
to
get
away
from
bmc
would
definitely
drink
again
serving
type
on
tap
at
the
landing
in
new
hope
pa
pint
glass
overall
an
incredible
beer
and
one
well
worthy
of
the
high
rating
on
this
site
that
being
said
if
you
dont
like
bitter
beer
but
not
differentiated
enough
from
mass
lagers
to
really
get
me
excited
about
the
beer

great
example
that

should
follow
not
enough
craft

lagers
on

but
it
probably
appropriate
for
the
dortmunder
beer
style
this
is
only
my
second
beer
sampled
from
this
style
hoptonius
union
was
the
first
and
that
beer
was
outstanding
this
beer
is
probably
truer
to
style
it
a
german
lager
no
doubt
it
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
cabin
fever

with

bodied
with
high

awesome
beer
and

this

is
the

of

really
light
beer
for
great
lakes
smells
german
malty
and
crisp
taste
is
awesome
for
the
style
o
i
bought
a
variety
pack
and
was
least
interested
in
this
one
because
i
dont
tend
to
favor
this
style
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
im
very
pleased
and
will
probably
get
this
again
othis
ia
another
damn
fine
beer
from
glbc
cheers
overall
a
very
respectable
lager
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
refreshing
and
insanely
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
picking
more
of
this
up
come
summer
time
o
interesting
lager
hard
to
describe
but
i
tried
my
best
very
unique
i
think
o
a
really
nice
lager
generally
i
find
the
style
to
be
weak
and
boring
but
this
one
had
nice
light
notes
with
a
good
quality
to
it
greatly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
lagers
should
be
full
of
grainy
balanced
flavor
with
low
esters
and
no
diactyl
this
beer
showcases
its
ingredients
and
does
a
lot
with
a
little
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
mikeg67
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
medium
white

is
yeasty

some

pears

is

yeasty
with
some
nice

notes
ending
with
some
nice
sweet
spicy

for
balance
this
is
my
first
dortmunder
style
so
overall
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
brew
pours
a
vibrant
golden
color
with
a
fingers
width
of
white
head
smells
of
earthy
floral
hops
taste
is
hop
forward
citrusy
and
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
bit

also
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
a
little
drying
as
well
one
of
the
better
lagers
ive
had
this
is
very
well
done
great
lakes
never
fails
me
a
very
good
lager
by
great
lakes
which
has
never
failed
to
impress
me
with
their
brews
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
lagers
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
wellbalanced
wellcrafted
beer
suits
the
style
to
the
t
an
archetype
certainly
yet
it
doesnt
get
me
terribly
excited
was
expecting
a
bit
more
given
the
rave
reviews
of
this
one
12
oz
bottle
pours
bronze
with
a
foamy
long
lasting
white
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
biscuit
malt
aroma
is
balanced
by
perfume
hops
and
tropical
fruit
medium
slightly
crisp
body
biscuit
malt
and
spicy
herbal
hops
fill
the
mouth
some
dms
come
through
long
bitter
finish
good
brew
but
too
much
dms
makes
me
take
off
some
points
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
robust
and
fullflavoured
lagers
that
ive
sampled
it
has
amazing
depth
with
very
high
drinkability
a
true
gem
of
a
beer
and
one
that
i
would
purchase
often
if
it
was
available
locally
you
have
to
try
this
brew
pours
a
bright
clear
amber
and
has
a
light
biscuity
smell
this
is
a
classic
clean
lagerbiscuit
malts
some
earthiness
a
good
hop
balance
some
lemon
zest
perfectly
mediumbodied
carbonation
very
smooth
going
down
my
local
grocery
store
has
this
so
im
going
to
have
to
start
stocking
it
in
our
fridge
more
oftenit
goes
with
everything
and
never
gets
old
a
very
tasty
lager
good
to
drink
a
cold
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
of
good
quality
o
this
is
a
lager
to
write
home
about
despite
many
unique
characteristics
it
still
manages
to
focus
on
being
a
well
balanced
thoroughly
flavorful
brew
overall
this
beer
is
great
for
any
occasion
it
is
light
and
crisp
but
is
still
packed
with
flavor
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
d
off
the
charts
drinkable
with
a
great
and
authentic
flavor
to
match
world
class
and
highly
recommended
a
fabulous
german
style
lager
that
i
would
seek
out
again
o
im
honeslty
disappointed
right
now
after
reading
the
reviews
i
was
expecting
a
great
beer
but
this
is
rather
boring
to
me
always
nice
to
try
new
things
though
forgot
how
much
i
loved
this
beer
definitely
one
of
the
greats
o
im
usually
not
a
lager
drinker
but
this
brewery
is
awesome
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
complex
easily
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
all
around
o
shockingly
good
easily
the
best
lager
ive
ever
encountered
superdrinkable
and
highly
recommended
delicious
orange
gold
color
medium
white
chunky
head
aroma
is
malty
fruity
and
sweet
a
medium
bodied
helles
malts
are
fruity
and
sweet
hops
are
slightly
spicy
and
a
touch
bitter
hints
of
orange
and
honey
nicely
balanced
light
and
refreshing
yet
very
flavorful
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
harsh
to
say
but
really
tastes
like
a
bigger
more
bitter
american
macro
lager
to
me
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
given
how
beautiful
it
was
in
the
glass
i
have
tasted
most
domestic
and
european
lagers
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
lager
ive
experienced
do
yourself
a
favor
go
out
and
buy
as
much
dortmunder
gold
as
you
can
find
i
pick
up
at
least
a
case
ever
time
im
in
ohio
its
harder
to
come
by
in
pa
great
great
great
beer
now
this
is
a
flagship
beer
but
we
all
know
gl
has
a
fleet
my
goto
beer
and
it
should
be
yours
as
well
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
german
lager
by
great
lakes
nice
malthop
balance
and
good
subtle
notes
of
fruit
overall
a
nice
solid
drinkable
lager
that
is
very
good
for
the
style
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
yet
i
like
it
more
in
the
style
than
as
an
overall
beer
good
for
the
summer
but
nothing
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
for
overall
quite
wonderful
without
a
doubt
i
will
get
again
highly
recommended
for
those
who
arent
too
snobby
to
enjoy
a
nice
red
stripe
or
gosser
or
heineken
superbly
done
a
very
drinkable
germanstyle
lager
overseas
deployment
and
hockey
stories
go
well
with
it
o
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
lager
nice
solid
body
and
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
overall
very
crisp
and
clean
and
easy
to
drink
everything
is
well
balanced
im
sure
i
will
enjoy
many
more
dortmunder
golds
in
the
coming
days
overall
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
a
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
lager
mouthfeel
and
overall
consistently
smooth
medium
bodied
and
fresh
i
love
this
beer
even
when
i
overpay
for
the
bottled
version
at
cavs
games
overall
an
exceedingly
drinkable
lager
worthy
of
the
german
heritage
it
alludes
to
in
its
name
a
solid
example
of
the
style
especially
for
something
brewed
this
side
of
the
atlantic
overall
very
drinkable
nice
and
sweet
at
the
start
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
dry
but
some
malt
sweetness
lingers
this
beer
is
great
deep
golden
brown
body
thick
head
malty
aroma
tastes
pretty
sweet
and
malty
with
just
a
kiss
of
hops
crisp
feel
easy
going
down
i
definitely
wanted
another
overall
the
critics
dont
lie
this
is
a
good
one
ive
been
enjoying
my
tour
of
highlyrated
domestic
craft
lagers
and
gldg
doesnt
disappoint
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
crisp
and
delicious
it
is
slightly
dry
and
not
very
sticky
o
good
beer
a
bit
less
sweet
than
i
initially
anticipated
o
dortmunder
gold
is
a
welltuned
beer
and
brings
very
good
drinkability
great
lakes
is
a
brewery
that
tends
to
brew
to
style
better
than
most
so
i
assume
dortmunder
gold
is
no
different
i
need
to
explore
this
style
pours
a
deep
golden
color
white
bubbly
foam
forms
and
has
good
staying
power
aroma
is
full
of
bready
biscuity
malt
and
a
light
floral
hopping
in
the
taste
clean
lager
flavor
crisp
somewhat
malty
and
biscuity
and
finishes
nice
and
even
with
leafy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
drying
finish
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
lager
true
to
style
i
can
see
why
lagers
of
this
quality
were
prized
back
in
the
day
taste
a
nice
reversal
of
the
aroma
the
flavour
is
nicely
bready
but
with
more
hops
than
malt
biscuit
flavours
back
up
floral
and
herbal
hops
with
a
refreshing
dry
finish
o
why
have
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
beer
i
picked
this
up
as
a
single
in
a
mixer
i
put
together
this
is
a
no
doubt
slamdunk
six
pack
purchase
next
time
overall
emminently
drinkable
very
smooth
going
down
a
fine
example
of
a
lager
a
solid
beer
certainly
one
of
the
better
german
style
lagers
brewed
in
the
united
states
oalright
but
not
one
i
will
purchase
again
o
a
very
good
summer
beer
and
one
that
i
would
order
again
without
hesitation
o
nothing
but
great
from
glbc
check
out
the
gold
medals
on
their
site
it
basically
speaks
for
itself
putting
a
gold
medal
as
the
main
label
of
a
brew
is
a
bold
statement
but
dortmunder
gold
has
earned
its
gold
its
proven
and
delicious
one
of
the
best
all
around
lagers
in
the
world
gold
is
not
just
a
way
of
describing
the
color
of
this
brew
but
a
way
of
describing
its
character
and
class
nothing
overly
brilliant
just
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
anyone
can
enjoy
its
a
blue
collar
lager
that
still
has
a
place
in
the
world
of
beer
must
try
poured
into
a
pint
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
tinge
or
orange
with
a
bright
one
finger
head
that
disapated
rather
quickly
smell
is
buscuity
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
some
piney
hops
taste
is
crisp
malt
crackers
some
pepper
and
grassy
piney
hops
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
well
balanced
for
its
style
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
tastey
lager
that
had
more
than
refreshing
to
offer
you
win
this
round
great
lakes
your
gold
medal
label
is
fully
justified
just
a
stellar
lager
loads
of
fun
to
drink
that
is
complex
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
discerning
beer
geek
but
accessible
enough
that
it
could
be
used
to
bring
those
who
normally
avoid
craft
beer
to
the
fold
great
example
of
the
brewers
art
and
absolutely
delicious
wish
i
had
this
at
home
for
everyday
quaffing
d
very
drinkable
dort
slightly
more
on
the
hop
side
but
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
another
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
pours
a
faintly
hazed
copper
tinted
gold
cap
of
creamy
offwhite
head
scent
is
of
freshly
dried
and
malted
grain
with
a
kiss
of
flowers
and
citrus
zest
taste
begins
with
a
lightly
sweet
freshly
dried
and
malted
grain
backed
by
a
light
kick
of
bitterness
before
ending
with
floral
and
citrus
notes
medium
bodied
smooth
lightly
creamy
a
very
nice
beer
great
freshness
to
the
taste
without
being
overly
sweet
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
mild
kick
not
too
filling
and
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
easily
a
beer
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
this
was
my
first
try
with
great
lakes
and
what
a
way
to
start
off
this
beer
is
great
it
has
good
taste
with
a
light
to
medium
body
its
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
on
a
hot
day
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
12
finger
white
head
the
head
disapears
pretty
quick
cheers
this
was
a
great
beer
it
has
a
nice
clean
malt
taste
to
it
that
is
balanced
by
a
slight
hop
bitterness
would
definitely
by
buying
again
o
this
was
a
nice
intro
to
great
lakes
it
has
the
soul
of
a
bigger
brew
but
i
feel
like
its
trapped
in
the
styles
smaller
body
good
experience
though
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
some
other
gl
offerings
while
im
in
the
area
doverall
i
was
pleased
with
this
lager
and
i
think
its
a
beer
that
could
ease
bmc
drinkers
into
the
craft
beer
scence
i
would
def
pick
this
up
for
friends
of
mine
color
is
goldish
amber
12
white
head
fades
rather
quickly
leaving
a
ring
behind
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
bready
and
a
little
citrusy
refreshing
taste
is
sweet
also
lightly
bitter
and
somewhat
fruity
mouthfeel
is
good
slick
smooth
and
medium
carbonation
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
im
sucking
it
down
pretty
fast
clear
gold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
drops
to
a
thin
covering
leaving
wispy
strings
of
lace
on
the
glass
clean
mild
floral
hop
and
bready
malt
aromas
moderately
sweet
crisp
and
balanced
flavor
grassy
hops
light
citrusy
fruit
pale
malt
medium
bodied
and
quite
resfreshing
a
nice
lager
overall
overall
a
very
nice
beer
its
wellbalanced
and
while
things
stick
out
a
bit
at
times
its
more
like
a
dance
that
carries
it
through
interesting
twists
and
turns
never
off
balance
but
rather
tilted
in
one
direction
at
one
time
and
the
other
direction
just
a
touch
later
interesting
and
yummy
this
one
pours
a
great
looking
golden
color
with
huge
amounts
of
visible
carbonation
this
probably
has
something
to
do
with
the
excellent
head
retention
aroma
has
plenty
of
breadynutty
malts
along
with
a
fair
level
of
herbal
bittering
the
taste
is
quite
good
it
goes
on
crisp
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
in
the
middle
the
nuttiness
of
the
malts
really
starts
to
come
out
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
fairly
thick
for
a
lager
but
feels
good
going
down
the
drinkability
is
superb
overall
this
is
a
great
lager
thatd
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
lived
in
the
area
im
not
going
to
go
crazy
not
being
able
to
get
it
though
o
really
impressed
with
this
beer
incredibly
easy
drinking
with
a
clean
flavor
profile
the
only
catch
is
that
the
price
of
a
6
pack
of
great
lakes
is
not
really
much
different
than
most
german
lagers
such
as
spaten
warsteiner
etc
so
im
thinking
the
major
reason
to
buy
this
over
those
would
be
the
freshness
of
the
beer
if
the
price
difference
were
two
bucks
a
sixer
less
i
would
make
this
beer
one
of
my
default
lagers
for
sure
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
mouthfeel
here
lightmediumbodied
for
a
lager
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
dortmunder
lager
this
beer
is
just
plain
delicious
if
i
could
buy
it
where
i
lived
i
would
use
it
to
convert
bmc
drinkers
over
to
the
side
of
craft
beer
i
bought
this
bottle
a
couple
days
ago
from
party
source
in
newport
kentucky
it
pours
light
bodied
and
a
bold
gold
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
glass
it
is
very
clear
and
has
nice
color
it
smells
of
pale
malts
light
yeast
light
breadiness
and
grains
with
light
spices
the
flavors
begin
with
a
dry
lightly
fruity
almost
pilsner
esque
sweetness
the
biscuity
malts
are
prevalent
and
pair
nicely
with
the
citrus
flavor
that
is
also
presented
it
finishes
pretty
dry
this
drinks
light
and
body
and
is
pretty
smooth
it
coats
the
palate
and
leaves
a
moderate
biscuit
flavor
behind
overall
its
a
pretty
good
dortmunder
its
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
so
its
worth
a
try
very
solid
truly
in
between
a
helles
and
a
pilsner
very
drinkable
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
2
inch
fizzy
white
head
that
lays
down
to
a
nice
lace
around
its
golden
color
body
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
my
taste
buds
get
a
sweet
malty
taste
on
the
first
part
then
a
hop
and
bitterness
on
the
back
end
of
it
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
with
a
little
of
a
after
taste
over
all
i
like
this
beer
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
overall
a
good
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
all
in
all
a
simple
beer
and
one
of
the
best
lowmoderate
abv
lagers
ive
had
would
be
a
nice
introductory
craft
beer
for
the
uninitiated
but
there
was
nothing
about
this
that
makes
me
want
to
have
it
again
kinda
tastes
like
highclass
bmc
beautiful
golden
amber
color
generous
head
and
lacing
smells
of
bread
and
biscuit
malty
fresh
yeasty
dough
tastes
medium
bodied
smooth
and
crisp
a
touch
of
bitterness
nice
and
light
yet
satisfying
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
darn
nice
lager
not
my
favorite
style
but
would
definitely
buy
again
for
a
change
of
pace
ive
only
ever
had
a
few
beers
of
this
style
and
hate
to
pass
judgment
on
this
one
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
probably
buy
it
again
but
i
would
like
to
sample
a
few
others
of
this
style
first
othis
is
a
great
beer
without
question
it
has
a
great
taste
color
and
feel
it
lacks
just
a
bit
in
the
smell
but
it
still
makes
a
great
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
is
no
secret
that
i
dont
like
lagers
but
i
do
love
great
lakes
i
do
have
a
bias
but
i
feel
like
they
are
incapable
of
disappointing
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
with
a
lot
of
chunky
head
great
lacing
and
great
retention
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
this
beer
definitely
gives
you
that
thin
bodied
bitter
feel
that
makes
lagers
suck
but
adds
a
nice
hint
of
mapleor
honey
the
malt
complexity
is
nice
and
gives
a
little
bit
of
a
bready
tastebut
it
doesnt
come
on
as
strong
as
some
other
german
styles
there
is
a
crisp
bitterness
but
i
wouldnt
say
that
the
hops
are
overdone
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
come
back
to
this
one
o
i
drove
from
beaumont
tx
to
arcadia
michigan
looking
for
this
and
the
edmunds
fitzgerald
only
found
this
i
was
at
gabf
and
saw
it
win
the
gold
medal
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
very
true
to
style
highly
recommended
this
is
my
favorite
beer
by
great
lakes
really
very
good
overall
not
something
i
would
track
down
again
but
a
great
addition
to
the
variety
case
good
lager
served
this
dortmunder
from
a
bottlepouredthis
golden
beauty
into
a
glass
and
it
had
an
inch
of
head
followed
with
a
nice
white
lacing
ha
that
reminds
of
a
song
anyhoo
the
smell
is
good
w
a
hint
of
apple
cinnamon
so
im
told
the
taste
is
slighty
bitter
and
bready
but
refreshing
with
no
hints
of
fruit
the
after
taste
is
kinda
dry
ill
have
to
try
this
one
on
tap
sometime
overall
its
good
tasting
beer
a
good
solid
beer
here
probably
nothing
go
out
of
your
way
for
though
overall
its
a
good
beer
first
time
with
the
style
but
had
it
a
few
times
now
a
pilsner
on
steroids
is
a
good
way
to
describe
it
overall
soild
example
of
a
lager
malty
bitterish
and
easy
to
drink
bout
as
good
a
lager
as
you
can
get
in
the
usa
low
alcohol
adds
to
how
great
this
beer
would
be
at
a
cookout
or
bbq
its
a
gold
metal
winner
for
a
reason
drinkability
despite
the
notable
clashing
flavor
the
beer
has
redeeming
qualities
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
oddly
if
i
drink
this
beer
following
glbcs
eliot
ness
i
get
a
nutty
flavor
and
the
bitterness
decreases
substantially
the
combination
of
the
two
in
sequence
is
very
stunning
and
i
find
the
flavor
of
this
brew
extremely
tasty
after
preconditioning
my
taste
buds
with
eliot
ness
first
o
excellent
excellent
excellent
i
need
to
try
more
of
this
and
more
from
great
lakes
o
pretty
much
spot
on
style
its
nice
to
drink
something
light
and
refreshing
once
and
awhile
the
city
of
dortmund
has
historically
been
a
major
industrial
center
for
coal
and
steel
manufacturing
no
wonder
it
birthed
a
style
of
beer
that
is
so
industriously
refreshing
and
tothepoint
gratifying
a
beer
to
chug
not
sip
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
indeed
a
shinning
example
of
the
style
as
well
as
an
exceedingly
enjoyable
lager
in
its
own
right
pours
one
finger
of
white
head
clear
amber
body
very
classic
smells
floral
and
fruity
maybe
apple
skin
some
classic
lager
yeasty
smells
quite
nice
as
well
tastes
grainy
like
pilsner
malt
touch
of
earthy
hops
some
carmel
some
typical
lager
yeast
characteristics
leathery
and
maybe
rubber
band
medium
thin
bodied
medium
carbing
overall
not
too
bad
but
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
id
prefer
a
touch
more
carmel
malt
and
a
touch
more
body
d
a
smooth
easy
drinker
with
enough
character
to
please
a
great
summer
beer
light
and
refreshing
while
maintaining
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
bitter
hop
notes
o
delicious
and
rewarding
from
a
style
that
can
go
so
very
wrong
perhaps
not
as
dry
as
a
traditional
example
the
roasted
malt
and
bread
notes
dominate
the
flavor
finishing
with
a
slight
orange
zest
and
bitter
herb
taste
mouth
feel
is
chewy
and
buttery
a
very
nice
beer
d
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
style
and
its
a
little
bit
sweeter
and
heavier
than
i
like
my
lagers
still
its
very
flavorful
and
im
loving
the
hop
character
definitely
recommended
and
it
hits
the
spot
pours
a
beautiful
slightly
dark
golden
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
head
in
the
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
tastes
of
breadiebiscuit
like
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
and
lemon
in
the
finish
its
nice
to
have
a
lager
that
doesnt
taste
like
rust
compared
to
all
the
other
bmc
type
of
lagers
you
normally
run
across
here
in
canada
good
session
lager
this
is
overall
great
beer
right
here
man
i
could
just
pound
these
back
like
nothing
i
want
to
have
this
on
tap
somewhere
it
just
feels
so
perfect
this
could
be
my
borderline
lawnmower
go
to
beer
all
the
time
lager
right
here
o
not
my
style
of
beer
that
said
it
was
still
pretty
good
ill
take
an
eliot
ness
over
this
any
day
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
and
banana
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
and
nutmeg
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
brew
the
nutmeg
aspect
was
a
little
palate
invasive
for
me
it
did
have
a
decent
flavor
and
aroma
going
on
here
but
nothing
too
memorable
i
would
suggest
this
to
people
to
try
it
as
it
is
worth
it
to
do
so
at
least
once
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
is
a
clear
solid
sparkling
golden
lager
with
a
big
frothy
bubbly
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
bready
yeasty
aroma
it
smells
a
little
grainy
a
little
fruity
it
has
a
lively
medium
body
with
a
metallic
feel
and
a
slightly
gritty
finish
it
tastes
malty
but
not
sweet
it
has
a
twangy
slightly
funky
flavor
theres
a
slight
juniper
bitterness
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
the
aftertaste
is
hoppy
is
there
fusel
detected
here
this
is
not
really
my
thing
it
seems
kind
of
like
a
malt
liquor
o
beer
with
high
drinkability
and
the
flagship
beer
of
great
lakes
that
is
widely
available
in
ne
ohio
not
my
favorite
of
their
yearround
beers
but
a
nice
refreshing
wellcrafted
beer
that
looks
great
dhopiness
start
to
build
halfway
through
beer
a
very
nice
flavorful
beer
that
is
a
nice
alternative
to
less
flavorful
lagers
o
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
if
it
were
more
readily
available
here
would
be
one
of
my
summer
staples
very
good
clean
flavors
suited
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
overall
a
beer
that
just
captures
the
style
very
very
well
i
thought
the
taste
was
complex
but
not
overly
so
very
refreshing
kuds
to
great
lakes
very
enjoyable
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
one
of
my
top
choices
when
im
in
ohio
very
well
balanced
and
always
refreshing
d
not
a
huge
beer
but
they
manage
to
squeeze
a
huge
amount
of
flavour
in
it
just
plain
delicious
this
beer
is
exciting
and
tasty
a
great
summer
beer
but
can
be
enjoyed
all
year
long
o
d
a
smooth
tasty
inoffensive
beer
not
my
favorite
style

something
i
enjoy
drinking

nothing

definitely
worth
checking

give
this
one
a
try
it
has
won
awards
so
dont
hesitate
great
crafting
d
great
beer
goes
with
almost
anything
ive
probably
had
this
more
than
any
other
craft
beer
at
sporting
events
when
introducing
people
to
craft
beer
and
more
no
complaints
about
that
not
a
great
beer
overall
but
good
for
a
lager
i
wouldnt
want
this
to
be
the
only
beer
i
drink
but
having
one
once
in
a
while
wouldnt
bother
me
d
easy
to
drink
clean
and
crispjust
like
a
good
lager
should
be
i
wish
this
was
a
more
prevalent
style
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
dortmunder
certainly
the
best
american
example
ive
had
whenever
your
in
the
mood
for
a
golden
lager
this
is
definetely
a
good
choice
this
is
absolute
perfection
in
a
bottle
just
pick
up
a
sixer
at
any
price
and
enjoy
this
is
craft
beer
at
its
absolute
finest
d
this
is
a
good
lager
very
solid
in
its
taste
and
feel
would
be
good
in
the
summer
yet
was
fulfilling
in
the
winter
d
definitely
worthy
of
the
awards
and
the
purchase
very
solid
brew
reminds
me
of
dortmunder
union
which
i
loved
but
cant
find
anymore
great
beer
it
looks
like
the
original
union
beer
and
i
drank
it
out
of
a
stein
which
created
a
very
nice
head
the
aroma
is
distinctive
and
the
taste
is
smooth
just
what
you
would
need
on
a
very
hot
day
i
taste
tested
this
beer
against
2
others
not
knowing
which
was
the
gold
and
i
chose
this
beer
as
my
favorite
this
beer
is
fantastic
perfect
for
the
style
perfect
balance
of
sweet
maltiness
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
hops
start
out
with
citrus
notes
before
they
turn
more
herbal
the
malt
gives
body
flavor
and
sweetness
this
is
a
great
lager
i
like
this
almost
as
much
as
elliot
ness
from
gl
they
make
some
great
beer
at
this
brewery
in
my
top
3
domestic
brewers
this
beer
is
the
best
beer
ohio
has
to
offer
it
compared
to
a
german
pilsner
my
favorite
type
of
beer
it
does
not
have
that
horrible
skunk
smell
that
most
german
pilsners
have
this
beer
had
exceptional
taste
and
was
worth
the
9
for
the
six
pack
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
as
well
as
on

huge
chew
of

malt
in
the

with
a
wonderful

there
is
a

you
taste
the

clean
and
satisfying
with
a

snap
a
very
nice
dortmund
styled
lager
with
a
rich
malt
spine
and
traditional
german
hopping
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
slight
one
finger
head
which
reduces
to
skim
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweetness
with
a
nice
biscuit
and
breadiness
to
it
the
taste
has
a
biscuit
and
bread
backbone
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
slight

at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
moderatley
carbonated
and
dry
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
a
smooth

is

balanced

this
is
really
a
pretty
nice
little
beer
solid
all
around
easy
drinking
and
balanced
well
worth
a
try
could
be
enjoyed
year
round
i
dont

unfiltered
fairly
carbonated
with
an

of
light

the
very
enticing

toasty

rich
and
toasty
munich
malts
meld
with
sweet
and
grainy
pilsner
malts
on
the
palate
backed
by
very
flavorful
spicyperfumy
hops
that
impart
a
lingering
medium
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
with
a
chewy
dry
finish
a
bit
heavy
but
very
nice
what
a
great
beer
here
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
lingering
finish
this
is
as
easy
to
sip
and
contemplate
as
it
is
to
drink
by
the
pint
or
at
least
it
would
be
if
i
only
had
more
bottles
a
wonderful
craftbrewed
domestic
lager
12oz

to
a
16oz

a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
runs
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
wonderful
very
sweet
pilsnerlike
smell
with
faint
spice
and
malts
at
the
edge
of
the
nose
a
very
bold
spicy
first
sip
that
ends
with
a
taste
somewhere
between
lemon
and
grapefruit
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
wanting
more
very
drinkable
as
it
lays
pretty
easy
in
the
belly
i
would
assume
it
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
but
its
not
doing
too
bad
in
january
either
drinkability
a
great
beer
that
deserves
all
its
awards
d
drinkability
is
high
a
light
refreshing
beer
with
a
nice
profile
to
it
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
the
bitterness
at
the
end
isnt
a
deterrent
this
is
a
classic
beer
right
here
this
is
the
only
lager
i
really
need
to
drink
ive
been
enjoying
this
one
since
i
got
into
craft
beer
great
beer
to
try
to
convert
your
noncraft
drinking
friends
without
a
doubt
the
benchmark
for
the
style
a
pure
winner
theres
a
reason
this
is
glbcs
flagship
brew
a
simply
amazing
lager
all
around
go
try
it
now
it
will
not
disappoint
this
is
a
real
nice
lager
but
without
much
to
distinguish
it
great
easy
drinking
beer
only
if
there
was
a
way
of
cramming
all
this
flavor
into
a
lower
alcohol
beer
drink
a
fantastic
full
bodied
beer
that
i
will
be
happy
to
drink
again
anytime
drinkability
yesits
a
bit
dry
but
still
interesting
good
changeup
from
the
normal
stouts
ipas
i
drink
drinkability
this
is
something
i
wish
i
had
access
too
daily
it
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
and
something
nice
to
share
a
must
try
pours
into
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
very
good
lacing
and
retention
carbonation
isnt
too
bad
either
has
a
nice
sweet
hoppy
smell
that
is
a
little
yeasty
and
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
taste
of
hops
that
are
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
to
the
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
a
nice
firm
taste
that
grips
the
cheeks
on
goes
down
smoothly
this
is
a
very
good
summer
drink
with
its
crisp
clean
feel
that
is
very
drinkable
this
style
of
lager
is
much
better
than
the
american
macros
like
budweiser
coors
or
miller
highlife
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
american
badass
and
moosehead
but
with
a
stronger
taste
and
more
flavor
to
it
after
trying
this
i
think
this
is
the
beer
that
other
brew
masters
are
going
to
wish
their
beers
were
as
good
as
this
if
your
looking
for
a
good
crisp
clean
beer
that
most
americans
would
be
used
to
when
it
comes
to
taste
appearance
smell
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
amazing
treat
yourself
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
would
definitely
recommend
to
try
and
would
repeat
buy
great
lakes
brewing
is
very
good
at
what
they
do
which
is
to
make
very
flavorful
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
their
attention
to
detail
is
evident
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
which
comes
across
as
assertive
but
not
overwhelming
if
youre
drinking
a
dortmunder
you
probably
want
to
be
refreshed
and
this
beer
fills
the
bill
you
wont
be
disappointed
very
good
and
easy
drinking
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
d
a
very
highly
drinkable
beer
one
of
if
not
the
best
american
lagers
that
ive
ever
tasted
i
would
be
happy
drinking
one
of
these
or
a
whole
six
pack
ive
never
seen
this
outside
of
the
ohiowestern
pa
area
but
definitely
pick
a
pack
up
if
you
see
it
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
personally
though
i
enjoy
it
sparingly
it
is
tasty
and
easy
to
put
down
but
the
style
is
just
not
quite
up
my
alley
on
a
wider
scale
though
someone
might
really
enjoy
this
as
a
session
beer
appearance
is
clear
with
nice
golden
color
no
seriously
it
really
looks
gold
one
finger
head
quickly
fizzles
away
smeels
malty
and
bready
with
light
hop
scent
in
the
background
good
solid
smell
that
i
can
get
without
even
putting
my
nose
to
the
glass
really
enjoy
the
smell
tastes
great
well
rounded
and
balanced
malty
bready
flavor
up
front
with
hoppy
aftertones
that
leaves
a
good
clean
finish
gives
a
nice
solid
feeling
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
particular
beer
this
is
the
3rd
sixer
i
have
purchased
and
wont
be
the
last
sixer
nice
solid
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
for
any
time
of
year

a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
very
nice
though
i
prefer
the
elliott
ness
to
this
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
great
for
a
warm
summer
day
in
the
back
yard
also
the
5
8
abv
is
an
added
bonus
as
you
can
have
more
than
a
couple
and
still
remain
functional
this
beer
looks
a
beautiful
golden
orange
color
with
some
nice
white
foam
with
some
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
very
bready
with
some
light
lemon
pepper
notes
overall
not
too
impressive
the
taste
is
rather
acidic
there
are
some
general
bitter
notes
that
are
perhaps
from
the
vinegary
flavor
notes
i
know
the
style
is
supposed
to
be
like
this
but
this
is
too
bitter
to
really
be
all
that
enjoyable
for
me
i
dont
know
why
but
im
starting
to
think
that
there
is
something
in
the
water
in
cleveland
that
doesnt
personally
work
with
my
taste
buds
serving
type
bottle
d
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
balance
and
complexity
upon
drinking
you
definatly
pick
up
on
a
sweet
grainy
flavor
much
hoppier
than
ive
expected
but
that
was
actually
pretty
pleasent
with
a
slightly
very
subtle
malty
finish
at
times
i
would
pick
up
on
a
very
citrusy
fruity
taste
something
like
a
hefe
but
as
quickly
as
it
would
surface
it
would
dissapear
again
all
in
al
a
great
brew
d
another
good
brew
from
great
lakes
also
had
this
one
in
the
sampler
case
i
highly
recommend
the
sampler
packs
very
good
choices
drinkability
off
the
charts
drinkable
tasty
but
light
every
brewpub
ought
to
have
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
like
this
in
its
regular
lineup
if
i
could
get
this
beer
locally
id
buy
it
by
the
case
especially
in
the
summer
drinkability
exceptional
crisp
malty
beer
this
guy
is
a
winner
i
havent
been
disapointed
by
great
lakes
brewing
yet
overall
this
is
a
very
inviting
beer
and
outstanding
specimen
of
a
craft
lager
some
beers
really
do
live
up
to
the
hype
a
great
dark
golden
color
aroma
is
malty
but
nothing
leaping
out
nice
flavors
of
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
very
smooth
all
of
the
flavors
really
come
together
my
first
of
this
style
but
wow
cant
imangine
any
better
then
this
just
a
great
full
floavred
beer
that
begs
you
to
have
another
d
excellent
beer
very
drinkable
id
certainly
order
it
again
great
clean
gold
just
slight
red
color
good
head
retention
nice
big
body
full
and
malt
taste
good
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
the
biscuit
or
bread
taste
didnt
get
as
much
of
the
hop
flavor
that
others
talk
about
but
that
didnt
wreck
the
taste
good
beer
just
after
two
or
three
it
starts
to
seem
like
a
meal
drinkability
is
flawless
flavors
are
perfect
both
in
amount
and
in
proportion
mouthfeel
follows
close
behind
beautiful
beer
for
anyone
who
loves
a
good
german
lager
drink
well
my
friends
pours
a
perfectly
clear
golden
color
with
a
frothy
and
magnificent
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
nice
malty
notes
upfront
bread
dough
hay
biscuit
along
with
some
turbinado
sugar
and
toffee
floral
hops
and
a
faint
note
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
also
very
malty
with
bread
dough
and
biscuit
upfront
as
well
as
hay
cane
sugar
treacle
and
some
herbal
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
without
being
watery
and
drinkability
is
very
good
very
pleasant
dortmunder
here
glad
to
see
more
examples
of
the
style
way
too
drinkable
a
randy
session
brew
for
sure
pours
a
clear
light
copperorangegold
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
extremely
honeylike
and
i
agree
with
those
who
detect
something
like
hay
to
the
extent
that
hops
are
detectable
on
the
nose
theyre
floral
the
flavors
are
more
complex
than
the
nose
suggested
with
a
malty
start
and
an
orange
citrusy
flavor
that
enters
on
the
midpalate
and
grows
in
strength
to
the
point
of
achieving
balance
by
the
end
finishes
dry
it
deserves
its
reputation
as
highly
drinkable
for
my
money
its
the
best
of
its
style
but
thats
not
necessarily
saying
much
d
decent
if
it
werent
for
the
bold
hopping
id
rate
this
beer
lower
theres
other
things
from
erie
that
are
much
better
but
overall
decent
not
memorable
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
great
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
can
see
why
this
beer
won
so
many
awards
if
bmc
beers
stepped
there
game
up
and
tasted
more
like
this
the
world
would
be
a
much
better
place
end
beer
musings
being
a
homebrewer
and
beer
enthusiast
it
is
well
known
it
is
much
harder
to
brew
a
clean
well
tasting
light
beer
or
lager
then
it
is
a
hearty
ris
stoutporter
etc
with
nothing
to
hide
any
imperfections
or
contaminations
while
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
this
makes
an
exception
on
what
a
lager
could
be
exceptionally
smooth
hoppy
with
a
great
grain
bill
that
is
well
balanced
i
could
easily
keep
a
keg
of
this
at
all
times
and
hardly
tire
of
its
thirst
quenching
session
style
drinkability
that
is
refreshing
from
all
others
per
style
a
top
100
beer
imho
when
style
is
considered
d
overall
very
nice
clean
and
tasty
very
solid
and
drinkable
but
not
a
knock
down
amazing
kind
of
brew
this
pours
a
deep
gold
with
some
loose
head
but
not
much
lacing
the
nose
is
a
piney
sweetness
but
im
not
getting
the
biscuit
note
that
others
are
in
the
mouth
its
a
very
balanced
brew
not
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
based
off
of
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
and
a
little
fuzzy
from
the
carbonation
one
could
drink
a
few
of
these
not
a
bad
beer
ive
been
really
pleased
with
the
sampler
from
great
lakes
tasty
tasty
just
held
back
a
bit
by
the
flat
nose
probable
due
to
the
age
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
sunny
autumn
afternoon
im
not
usually
a
lager
fan
but
this
one
surprised
me
well
crafted
and
worth
seeking
out
o
very
good
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
great
lakes
d
taste
is
not
overbearing
and
along
with
the
crisp
finish
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
better
than
your
average
lager
d
great
lager
session
friendly
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
winner
winner

this
is
a
beer
which
demands
certain
attention
even
if
youre
not
particularly
into
the
style
its
pretty
impressive
i
havent
had
a
beer
of
this
style
before
to
me
its
a
fairly
average
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
it
doesnt
stand
out
too
much
to
me
in
any
way
though
it
does
seem
like
itd
be
a
decent
summer
beer
pours
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
amber
with
dense

mastered
56
abv
beers
with
tons
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
any
day
of
the
year
as
a
native
of
cleveland
ill
start
off
with
the
disclaimer
that
im
extremely
partial
to
this
brewery
that
said
its
merits
easily
transcend
hometown
pride
and
the
dortmuder
gold
is
perhaps
glbcs
best
ambassador
pity
its
not
available
out
here
12oz
light
aroma
with
a
rather
small
head
floral
mild
pine
where
the
beer
comes
alive
is
in
the
mouthfeel
its
perhaps
the
ideal
weight
for
a
lager
with
enough
heft
to
stand
up
to
food
and
flexibility
enough
to
be
enjoyed
in
beyond
responsible
quantities
slightly
creamy
as
well
with
a
light
hop
finish
what
an
american
lager
should
be

while
in
town
for

chocolate

12oz
bottle
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
pours
a
crisp
bubbly
orange
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
a
trace
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
crisp
sweet
malts
and
slight
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
mild
caramel
with
a
nice
earthy
hop
backbone
the
beer
is
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
to
end
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
quite
possibly
my
absolute
favorite
average
strength
lager
a
truly
wonderful
beer
served
in
a
guinness
pint
glass
pour
results
in
a
two
finger
head
that
holds
its
lace
nicely
a
nice
malty
nose

wonderful

good

big
macros
could
take
a
lesson
in
how
to
brew
a
wonderful
lager
such
as
this
a
homerun
for
great
lakes
and
one
that
will
be
a
regular
guest
in
my
refrigerator
bottle
pours
a
very
clean
light
reddish
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
nice
collar
the
aroma
that
i
get
is
a
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
actually
has
an
aroma
like
apples
or
pears
interesting
taste
sweet
up
front
followed
by
a
slight
hop
bite
in
the
back
but
the
sweetness
really
never
goes
away
medium
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
bad
smooth

beer
d
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
highly
recommended
for
sessioning
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
great
lakes
beers
that
have
finally
made
their
way
to
minnesota
this
beer
is
about
as
crisp
as
you
can
make
it
the
euro
malt
and
the
sharp
hops
in
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
make
this
a
lager
to
think
about
a
well
crafted
and
extremely
enjoyable
lager
i
really
enjoyed
gls
take
on
this
very
european
style
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
its
a
great
drinkable
standby
that
knocks
most
likestyle
beers
out
of
the
water
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
great
lakes
brewery
lineup
but
then
again
glbc
makes
some
astounding
beers
so
that
by
no
mean
qualifies
this
as
a
sub
par
brew
i
cant
imagine
any
beer
drinker
hating
the
good
old
dortmunder
d
very
very
drinkable
anyone
would
drink
this
stuff
nothing
is
offense
or
challenging
just
easy
drinking
goodness
d
an
excellent
lager
and
my
first
and
regrettably
only
great
lakes
brewing
beer
to
date
a
very
nice
brew
if
you
can
find
it
it
is
a
great
accompaniment
to
food
and
a
very
solid
wellmade
lager
with
nice
body
and
a
sweeter
fruitier
aroma
and
flavor
profile
this
beer
delivers
some
flavor
complexity
and
balance
while
still
remaining
refreshing
and
exceptionally
drinkable
hmm
something
good
that
comes
from
the
mistake
by
the
lake
palate
is
malt
and
sweetness
balanced
by
herbal
and
citrus
hops
on
a
nice
mediumlight
body
with
moderate
carbonation
seems
simple
enough
but
its
very
very
well
done
tasty
and
drinkable
crisp
clean
with
assertive
noble
hops
malty
munich
and
sweet
caramel
with
a
dry
finish
and
just
a
hint
of
sulfury
yeast
contribution
what
more
could
you
want
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
the
munich
and
caramel
malts
will
have
you
dreaming
of
pork
chops

there
is

with
a
decent
snappy

the

this

a
very

made
beer
that
ive
enjoyed
drinking
and
would
be
happy
to
have
a

i
will
most

have
this

again
in

look

the
chance
to
set
up
a
side

tasting
with

refreshing
i
guess
i
can
see
why
american
brewers
mimicked
styles
like
this
for
so
long
white
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
the
aroma
is
not
that
potent
but
it
smells
nicely
balanced
between
the
pale
malt
and
hops
not
as
malty
as
munich
lagers
but
that
is
a
minor
gripe
when
the
beer
is
so

tasty
its
a
mix
of
dry
biscuit
raw
hop
and
citric
drying
grain
and
tones
of
lemon
the
refreshmnet
factor
is
great
in
this
beer
couples
with
a
very
good
flavor
makes
me
want
more
of
this
beer
too
bad
great
lakes
beer
is
a
rarity
in
socal
purchased
at
lone
hill
liquor
glendora
ca
prosit
mk
mouthfeel
is
smooth
finishing
light
but
not
watery
finishes
much
cleaner
than
most
lagers
feels
well
aged
awesome
lager
it
has
an
excellent
array
of
spicy
notes
many
of
which
are
unidentifiable
as
well
as
a
flavor
of
caramel
this
beer
is
very
smooth
on
the
pallet
and
provides
a
decent
amount
of
mouthfeel
especially
for
the
style
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
which
provide
a
bitter
sensation
at
the
center
longitudinally
spanning
from
the
back
to
the
middle
back
to
front
of
the
tongue
ive
had
this
beer
out
of
both
a
stange
and
a
pint
glass
it
is
better
tasting
out
of
the
pint
glass
at
the
expense
of
the
superior
aroma
from
the
stange
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
aproximently
7
months
ago
it
was
good
but
it
was
one
of
four
amazing
great
lakes
products
that
made
great
seem
ordinary
7
months
and
80
beers
later
i
realized
how
spoiled
i
was
that
night
and
bought
it
again
the
beer
pour
a
bright
golden
and
has
a
very
flavorful
smell
the
smell
is
not
misleading
as
the
flavor
is
both
light
and
not
overwhelming
but
has
an
enjoyable
bite
and
goes
down
well
though
it
feels
light
im
not
sure
its
a
real
session
beer
though
im
sure
it
will
work
that
way
if
you
love
beer
and
are
visiting
ohio
buy
a
great
lakes
sampler
that
includes
this
beer
you
wont
be
disappointed
d
great
here
easily
a
really
drinakable
session
beer
very
good
example
of
the
style
have
had
this
in
bottles
also
and
is
good
also
drinkability
this
is
a
session
beer
being
raised
as
i
was
on
shit
american
lagers
having
some
great
lagers
in
the
rotation
is
a
must
i
cant
do
big
beers
all
the
time
this
is
a
great
option
d
now
i
know
why
there
were
only
two
in
the
sampler
12pack
they
were
keeping
the
extras
for
themselves
very
drinkable
beer
while
i
didnt
enjoy
dortmunder
quite
as
much
as
eliot
ness
it
is
still
a
damn
good
lager
and
beer
another
solid
offering
from
glbc
nice
beerbest
of
the
lager
catagory
i
have
ever
tasted
i
would
love
for
great
lakes
to
be
sold
in
phila
d
super
high
drinkablily
this
beer
has
got
just
about
everything
anyone
might
be
looking
for
its
light
enough
to
have
a
couple
but
not
so
light
as
to
be
uninteresting
and
thin
its
got
malt
sweetness
galore
but
has
an
aggressive
enough
hop
profile
to
keep
hop
heads
interested
as
well
poured
attractive
clear
dark
golden
color
with
generous
white
head
that
lingered
a
while
aroma
was
a
pleasant
balanced
of
malt
and
hops
flavor
was
nicely
malty
with
a
good
hop
presence
as
well
slightly
sweet
excellent
session
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
more
of
very
refreshing
notes
it
is
just
darn
good
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
to
pull
out
and
shove
in
the
face
of
those
who
say
boo
to
light
colored
beers
medium
to
full
bodied
very
clean
very
malty
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
well
balanced
just
about
perfect
this
one
delicious
beer
and
pairs
well
with
the
dog
days
of
summer
wellcarbonated
good
body
quite
drinkable
nothing
really
outstanding
here
but
a
pretty
solidly
made
beer
a
exellent
lager
but
i
dont
think
the
germans
would
call
it
a
classic
example
of
a
dortmunder
a
good
goto
export
lager
for
watching
the
brewers
struggle
on
the
tryptic
flat
screens
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
comes
highly
recommended
d
no
complaints
one
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
again
drunk
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
one
of
my
many
pint
glasses
has
a
pretty
clear
gold
color
to
it
head
is
a
nice
one
finger
white
smell
tons
of
rich
malts
kinda
has
that
lager
smell
to
it
as
well
taste
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
all
the
way
through
little
crisp
twang
in
the
back
sweet
malts
and
some
citrusy
hops
come
together
for
a
great
balance
never
had
this
style
before
but
i
was
extremely
pleased
desreves
that
gold
medal
on
the
label
dortmunder
gold
is
a
classic
its
obviously
great
lakes
brewings
flagship
beer
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
personally
i
dont
think
its
their
best
beer
but
its
damn
fine
and
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
perhaps
the
best
its
certainly
one
you
cant
miss
d
refreshing
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
d
very
clean
easy
drinking
lager
with
substantially
more
flavour
than
most
notes
no
complaints
about
this
one
an
excellent
lager
with
tons
of
flavor
poured
a
bottle
into
the
chalicesque
glass
the
bar
provided
has
this
many
time
before
and
the
quality
has
alwas
been
consistent
nice
golden
clear
color
with
healthy
head
sharp
hop
aroma
and
taste
very
crisp
feeling
in
the
mouth
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
it
does
what
it
tries
to
do
very
well
a
solid
beer
d
such
a
smooth
beer
great
for
a
nice
summer
day
drinking
all
day
very
drinkable
could
easily
do
a
quite
a
few
of
these
of
these
a
great
lager
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
d
i
like
dorts
a
lot
and
this
one
hit
the
spot
very
deserving
of
its
gold
i
would
certainly
not
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
and
consider
this
highly
quaffable
kudos
great
lakes
great
ale
and
lager
maker
this
is
what
i
call
a
refreshing
beer
yum
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
sucker
is
crisp
and
mighty
tasty
it
appears
a
clear
brilliant
gold
with
a
bit
of
white
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lager
tamd
and
sour
pale
biscuity
grain
that
same
sort
of
sourdough
flavor
carries
through
with
a
balanced
but
rich
hops
kick
of
grassy
spice
and
grinding
citrus
rind
bitterness
really
this
is
beer
is
a
treat
and
a
nice
alternative
to
pilsners
when
i
want
a
hoppyish
lager
bottle
thanks
to
nrbw23
poured
a
deep
golden
color
medium
head
with
lacing
on
the
glass
this
is
my
first
dortmunder
style
and
im
liking
it
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
helles
and
a
pilsner
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
just
enough
hops
to
know
they
are
there
clean
aftertaste
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
this
beer
would
be
exceptional
on
tap
d
solid
lager
a
great
stand
by
notes
this
is
the
flagship
beer
for
great
lakes
and
a
very
solid
offering
this
is
what
a
good
lager
should
taste
like
a
definite
must
for
the
summer
dnotes
the
perfect
gateway
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
having
been
out
of
the
cleveland
area
for
close
to
a
decade
with
occasional
visits
home
i
have
watched
this
and
some
other
great
lakes
beers
slowly
become
more
and
more
prevalent
in
bars
it
has
also
slowly
become
the
beer
of
choice
for
many
of
my
friends
so
drinkable
completely
defies
my
lager
impression
a
top
notch
beer
and
the
best
lager
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
very
good
light
flavored
american
lager
it
is
very
drinkable
which
caused
my
glass
to
empty
very
quickly
d
this
is
the
perfect
summer
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
of
it
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
very
well
refined
dortmunder
with
complexity
and
richness
seldom
seen
in
a
lighter
lager
well
done
by
great
lakes
cheers
di
really
like
this
beer
nicely
balanced
with
a
light
body
not
watery
and
very
refreshing
moreys
bottom
line
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
beer
and
being
proud
of
it
highly
recommended
for
lager
and
ale
drinkers
d
good
all
around
this
one
gets
an
a
in
drink
for
sure
year
round
hot
or
cold
this
is
some
drinkable
stuff
ive
had
this
both
on
bottle
and
on
tap
but
ill
limit
the
review
to
on
tap
this
is
an
absolutely
delightful
beer
yes
i
said
delightful
rich
and
full
of
flavor
the
beer
pours
out
golden
with
an
deep
amber
hugh
the
scent
is
very
grainy
or
as
a
friend
who
also
tried
it
said
thats
what
beer
is
supposed
to
smell
like
it
is
wonderful
in
the
mouth
and
easy
to
drink
those
new
to
drinking
premium
beers
may
be
put
off
by
the
taste
but
i
fell
in
love
with
the
first
glass
nice
drinkable
it
goes
down
easy
nothing
outstanding
but
like
other
gl
selections
it
balances
both
quality
accessibility
to
please
both
purists
and
your
average
beer
drinker
drinkability
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
dortmunder
id
say
i
would
have
it
around
regulary
but
great
lakes
beers
are
regrettably
unavailable
in
my
state
finishes
mostly
dry
with
a
good
hop
puckering
in
the
end
as
well
i
thought
this
was
okay
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
i
think
i
could
grow
to
like
this
one
easy
drinker
for
sure
wow
what
a
lager
this
beer
is
expertly
crafted
and
is
the
benchmark
for
this
style
it
is
beautifully
balanced
and
it
has
a
considerable
depth
to
the
flavors
although
the
abv
may
be
just
a
little
high
i
think
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
definitely
a
top
notch
lager
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
pours
coppergolden
color
with
a
large
white
frothy
head
it
has
a
little
sweet
and
malty
aroma
and
the
taste
is
very
nice
for
the
style
full
body
there
was
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
and
is
a
nice
beer
for
a
light
lunch
the
body
is
close
to
mid
than
light
i
would
have
liked
to
see
it
finish
lower
with
more
of
a
crispness
as
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
especially
for
style
there
is
a
definite
yeasty
finish
that
is
offset
and
really
is
a
deterrent
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
lot
of
tangibles
that
are
missed
here
then
again
this
is
a
very
difficult
beer
to
brew
this
beer
had
a
great
color
khaki
golden
and
crisp
had
a
nice
white
head
with
decent
carbonation
the
aroma
was
grainy
and
like
others
who
rated
this
beer
it
had
notes
of
biscuit
and
oatmeal
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
i
highly
suggest
this
beer
to
have
as
a
staple
in
your
fridge
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
whitish
head
nose
is
sweet
in
nature
but
doesnt
seem
overly
complex
flavor
is
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
also
seems
to
fade
over
time
so
that
it
doesnt
kill
the
experience
noticeable
grain
tones
that
grow
as
it
warms
feel
is
smooth
on
both
ends
this
is
easily
drinkable
though
not
very
complex
the
higher
sweet
tone
might
be
a
bit
much
for
some
people
to
me
this
tastes
like
another
typical
export
lager
good
over
all
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
above
the
rest
12
oz
bottle
pours
copper
with
a
1
cm
foamy
off
white
head
aroma
is
mostly
malts
some
lemon
and
some
strange
nut
or
woodiness
initial
flavor
is
covered
by
the
malts
ends
with
hops
and
spice
some
decent
lacing
noted
carbonation
light
on
alcohol
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
but
adequate
for
the
style
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
options
from
gl
this
beer
crossed
me
as
one
of
those
gratuitous
light
beers
that
a
brewpub
will
have
to
appease
the
bud
drinkers
and
draw
them
to
the
next
level
so
ive
been
rather
hard
on
it
for
years
i
apologize
this
is
a
real
world
class
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
ok
enjoyed
d
so
easy
to
consume
the
quintessentially
drinkable
lager
one
id
have
on
hand
all
summer
long
were
it
available
out
here
thanks
to
vwcraig
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hopleaf
poured
amber
with
a
deceent
head
and
excellent
lacing
smelled
of
lager
yeast
with
a
slightly
grainy
sweetness
happily
the
taste
is
a
good
deal
more
interesting
with
slightly
sweet
flavors
of
vanilla
and
banana
more
lager
yeast
and
a
slight
but
pleasant
graininess
uber
smooth
and
a
bit
soft
in
the
mouth
this
is
truly
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
style
even
though
i
usually
drink
ales
and
this
is
a
beautiful
interpretation
of
it
a
little
fruitier
and
richer
and
fuller
than
some
while
keeping
the
abv
in
check
great
beer
overall
i
liked
this
one
it
was
a
nice
classic
german
lager
with
a
good
hop
kick
in
the
back
a
nice
little
different
one
for
me
in
the
midst
of
everything
being
so
complex
with
different
things
added
and
different
temperatures
sometimes
you
just
want
to
grab
something
and
not
have
to
think
about
it
here
you
go
this
is
the
one
for
that
drinkability
a
delicious
and
very
drinkable
lager

best
dortmunder
i
have
run
across
this
brewery
and
this
beer
in
particular
were
a
very
pleasant
surprise
to
find
while
on
vacation
in
ohio
drinkability
is
great
strong
beer
but
very
easy
to
drink
possibly
the
best
dortmunder
around
this
was
a
very
bright
clean
and
enjoyable
beer
although
all
facets
were
above
average
the
combined
effect
turned
out
to
be
slightly
better
than
the
individual
components
let
me
first
say
that
i
am
a
very
big
fan
of
great
lakes
brewing
co
they
are
quite
possibly
my
favorite
brewing
co
in
the
usa
but
i
have
to
be
honest
maybe
this
was
just
spoiled
they
dont
pasteurize
or
an
old
batch
i
was
thoroughly
unimpressed
with
this
beer
the
only
thing
i
could
compare
this
too
would
be
a
thick
version
of
miller
high
life
pale
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
a
bit
funky
i
may
try
this
again
down
the
road
and
rerate
it
to
balance
it
out
but
otherwise
a
huge
letdown
pours
a
clear
light
copper
hue
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
small
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
nothing
to
write
home
about
smell
is
almost
like
a
smoked
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
white
grapes
some
corn
like
aromas
emerge
as
well
just
a
pleasant
smelling
beer
overall
taste
is
of
mild
buttery
biscuit
mild
caramel
malt
and
mild
citrus
hop
overall
this
one
is
extremely
balanced
with
an
amazing
bouquet
of
flavors
aftertaste
is
pretty
weak
but
has
hints
of
grain
and
wheat
light
to
medium
body
with
a
fair
carbonation
very
interesting
brew
it
grew
on
me
after
a
few
sips
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
look
forward
to
comparing
great
lakes
to
other
breweries
version
of
this
style
over
this
could
be
a
nice
session
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
slightly
high
abv
pours
a
clean
yellow
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
a
small
malt
but
not
much
going
on
in
the
taste
again
just
a
small
maltiness
but
not
much
to
say
a
very
small
bitter
mouthfeel
and
a
light
malty
aftertaste
very
clean
good
for
a
palate
clensor
very
similar
to
a
macro
lager
copper
colored
initially
poured
with
a
1
foamy
head
which
quickly
disipated
to
a
bubbly
layer
it
is
a
bit
darker
than
many
other
lagers
suggesting
a
richer
flavor
the
aroma
comes
across
as
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
rich
for
a
lager
sweet
on
the
tongue
with
an
unremarkable
finish
it
doesnt
feel
thin
in
the
mouth
but
rich
and
viscous
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
most
occasions
while
i
prefer
ales
to
lagers
this
is
a
great
beer
the
great
lakes
company
provides
yet
another
great
offering
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
very
little
carbonation
the
head
starts
out
thick
and
foamy
but
thins
out
to
a
thick
lace
smell
sweet
but
isnt
very
strong
and
aromas
a
pretty
minimal
taste
is
biscuity
and
quite
dry
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
the
second
time
having
this
beer
but
only
the
first
time
reviewing
this
is
much
better
than
i
remember
it
the
bottom
line
a
simple
yet
tasty
offering
by
great
lakes
the
very
definition
of
a
sessionable
beer
to
me
very
easy
to
drink
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
standards
but
perhaps
the
best
dortmunder
i
had
will
get
a
few
for
next
springsummer
had
this
beer
while
at
slows
bbq
beer
was
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
poured
to
a
nice
golden
color
very
clear
with
a
fair
sized
off
white
head
that
had
some
retention
till
it
broke
down
leaving
a
nice
ring
of
froth
along
the
sides
the
aroma
is
of
malt
with
some
clear
hop
scent
which
is
a
little
surprising
based
on
the
style
the
taste
is
nice
malt
flavors
come
out
from
the
start
they
are
quote
pronounced
they
mix
nice
with
a
slight
fruit
flavor
and
a
slight
hop
presence
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
another
excellent
offering
from
great
lakes
i
really
wish
we
could
get
this
stuff
in
ny
drinkability
could
do
two
in
a
night
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
glad
i
have
more
of
these
overallquite
possibly
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
and
maybe
the
best
lager
ive
every
had
i
tried
this
bad
boy
at
the
hard
rock
cafe
in
downtown
cleveland
i
drank
with
brunch
that
was
served
before
the
brownsravens
game
this
beer
was
fresh
this
is
brewed
only
a
few
miles
from
where
it
was
served
it
pours
a
nice
copper
color
yellowishpartially
unfiltered
looking
it
has
a
nice
zing
that
dances
on
the
tongue
but
does
not
linger
for
to
long
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
on
any
occasion
i
think
i
will
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
my
next
bbq
pretty
awesome
beer
especially
because
it
was
free
all
i
can
say
about
this
another
fine
brew
from
a
fine
brewery
pours
a
clear
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
loose
full
finger
white
head
that
resists
fading
spotty
lacing
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
full
flavored
the
biscuity
malt
taste
and
balanced
crisp
character
resonates
with
a
fresh
light
bitterness
through
the
finish
a
wonderful
drinker
this
is
a
robust
first
class
lager
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
scent
along
with
a
faint
hop
aroma
its
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
so
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
hoppy
i
wish
it
wasnt
as
bitter
as
it
is
the
malt
bill
seems
just
about
perfect
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
lager
i
love
the
malt
flavor
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
hop
character
in
this
one
d
a
fresh
beer
for
summertime
enjoyment
a
good
session
beer
so
many
readers
dislike
lagers
this
is
a
very
good
one
drinkability
awesome
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
would
pair
well
with
many
foods
d
a
good
lager
with
some
complexity
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
a
little
dry
but
nice
on
a
summer
day
pours
a
nice
string
gold
color
smells
of
malts
and
hops
very
nice
malted
scent
very
tasty
beer
with
refreshing
malt
and
hops
and
not
too
citrus
hints
of
pepper
and
spices
very
refreshing
great
mouth
feel
balance
between
great
flavors
and
refreshing
beer
nice
big
white
head
clear
gold
color
nice
lacing
all
down
the
glass
exactly
what
one
thinks
of
when
thinking
of
lager
beer
very
nice
malty
smell
with
a
slight
hop
aroma
great
full
flavored
taste
nothing
is
too
much
a
very
good
balanced
beer
leaves
no
sour
aftertaste
and
is
not
overly
drying
either
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
could
be
had
all
day
long
a
average
brew
hence
the
straight
threes
a
clear
golden
brew
with
a
fair
head
that
recedes
to
a
light
covering
and
leaves
little
lacing
the
smell
is
corn
there
is
also
some
medicinal
aftertaste
but
it
is
not
too
harsh
and
doesnt
affect
the
drinkability
of
the
brew
overall
a
fair
beer
that
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
sessionable
brew
for
sure
d
excellent
beer
from
the
crew
at
great
lakes
the
malty
flavors
and
crisp
hop
finish
are
excellent
for
a
muggy
summer
day
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
light
copper
gold
a
nice
but
small
offwhite
head
forming
and
holding
at
a
solid
film
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
spicy
hops
first
toasty
grainy
malts
second
pretty
decent
but
not
assertive
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
drying
toward
the
end
a
nice
balance
of
bittering
hops
with
noble
spices
and
slightly
toasted
but
definitely
grainy
malts
very
refreshing
indeed
a
good
beer
to
have
a
number
of
in
the
fridge
particularly
this
time
of
year
overall
this
beer
was
a
rather
light
refreshing
palate
cleansing
and
easydrinking
offering
at
the
same
time
it
was
flavorful
enough
to
keep
my
interest
it
also
paired
perfectly
with
my
pizza
and
would
go
well
with
a
variety
of
pub
fare
d
easy
quaffable
on
par
with
the
best
german
lagers
would
be
a
great
crossover
beer
for
novice
beer
drinkers
its
bitter
shows
the
hops
but
inviting
drinkability
an
everyday
beer
to
be
sure
all
around
and
trying
not
to
be
biased
i
have
to
say
its
a
great
beer
a
great
dortmunder
purchased
the
bottle
at
on
stage
i
think
that
was
the
name
a
restaurant
in
concourse
c
at
the
cleveland
airport
and
smuggled
the
bottle
through
security
got
this
one
in
a
gl
taster
pours
a
nice
copper
gold
color
with
a
head
that
disappears
disappointingly
fast
nose
is
strong
on
hops
and
some
grain
along
with
some
light
banana
taste
is
fairly
similar
lots
of
grain
some
light
citrus
and
some
drying
hops
again
at
the
back
body
is
a
touch
thin
but
overall
solid
on
carbonation
this
one
is
a
tasty
one
that
id
drink
again
although
in
my
opinion
it
didnt
top
the
elliot
ness
or
edmund
fitzgerald
that
were
also
in
the
taster
d
very
high
especially
on
a
hot
humid
ohio
evening
two
thumbs
up
very
easy
drinking
a
great
brew
for
a
hot
day
smooth
crisp
well
balanced
will
have
to
pick
up
more
for
the
up
comming
summer
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
to
make
it
crisp
goes
down
really
easy
but
still
quite
flavorful
overall
not
a
bad
brew
fairly
accurate
for
the
style
possibly
it
falls
a
bit
short
in
the
hops
end
of
the
equation
nonetheless
worth
a
try
wonderfully
drinkable
this
one
stands
out
for
the
style
a
friend
of
mine
recently
brought
this
back
from
ohio
if
it
were
available
around
here
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
the
hot
summer
days
a
welldeserved
medal
winner
im
a
hellas
fan
and
this
has
a
nice
west
coast
apa
german
hellas
combo
goin
on
and
the
biiterrosey
aftertaste
is
like
some
dortmunder
badge
of
honor
da
this
beers
good
d
still
an
excellent
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
simple
i
think
just
about
any
beer
drinker
could
appreciate
this
highly
recommended
feeling
light
to
medium
bodied
this
still
is
a
very
refreshing
and
clean
brew
it
makes
me
actually
proud
to
be
an
ohio
native
this
is
a
great
session
brew
and
pairs
great
with
our
hot
ohio
summers
overall
this
is
a
good
dortmunder
example
the
style
is
characterized
by
balance
and
i
really
think
this
fits
the
bill
its
a
great
introductory
beer
to
craft
brew
for
those
who
are
new
kind
of
a
stronger
and
allbarley
malt
version
of
the
common
americanstyle
lager
i
find
it
enjoyable
and
very
welldone
but
i
dont
think
it
would
be
my
first
choice
if
presented
with
some
of
great
lakes
other
tasty
brews
the
dortmunder
gold
pours
into
my
pint
glass
a
brilliant
clean
gold
liquid
the
thin
sparse
head
left
some
lacing
smell
is
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
but
to
a
perfect
degree
the
hops
make
their
presence
known
by
helping
the
brew
stay
dry
and
clean
on
the
palate
one
of
the
lightest
beers
ive
had
that
still
held
a
ton
of
character
very
drinkable
very
crisp
beer
as
per
the
lager
profile
looked
good
tasted
good
and
was
enjoyed
all
except
for
that
smell
who
knows
maybe
thats
just
my
upper
lip
oh
snap
d
theres
a
lingering
heavier
malt
character
in
the
aftertaste
that
keeps
the
flavor
from
being
clean
and
refreshing
and
thus
more
drinkable
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
as
drinkable
as
i
remember
d
i
will
have
this
again
it
was
quite
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
its
a
great
refreshing
brew
that
goes
with
any
meal
and
is
great
at
any
time
of
the
year
espicially
summer
poured
out
a
straw
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
was
mostly
fresh
grain
not
much
else
the
taste
was
very
well
balanced
some
light
malt
and
light
hop
notes
had
a
light
but
bitter
finish
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
lager
i
used
to
drink
it
often
when
i
was
first
crossing
over
from
lesser
brews
another
very
solid
offering
from
an
often
ignored
brewer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
doesnt
get
bogged
down
by
any
resinlike
sensation
from
the
hops
this
is
the
very
epitome
of
a
session
brew
i
cant
believe
its
been
since
before
i
was
a
ba
that
ive
had
this
last
ill
be
sure
not
to
wait
so
long
next
time
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
tried
if
this
were
available
in
nebraska
it
would
be
a
regular
visitor
to
my
house
especially
on
my
deck
on
a
hot
summer
night
quite
good
i
usually
tire
of
the
taste
after
drinking
a
few
lagers
but
this
is
exceptional
drinkability
clearly
to
style
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
dortmunder
lagers
pours

it
left
a

keen

that

i
generally
love

i
tried

some

i
hope
taste

making
this

highly

wow
really

this
is
a
good
session
beer
or
the
first
beer
of
the
day
i
like
start
out
with
a
less
aggressive
beer
first
but
not
all
the
time
dont
start
with
an
stone
ab
then
switch
to
a
dortmunder
not
a
good
idea
on
tap
its
tough
to
find
a
better
beer
this
stuff
is
what
beer
is
meant
to
be
starts
off
with
a
rocky
silky
smooth
and
withstanding
head
retention
follows
up
with
a
golden
orange
hue
with
a
clean
clear
look
smells
and
tastes
very
fruity
with
oranges
peaches
and
appricots
very
ripe
and
fresh
quite
hoppy
with
the
english
variety
showing
very
stable
citrus
and
pine
flavors
but
with
no
real
aggression
very
smooth
and
clean
to
drink
an
ultimate
thirst
quincher
plenty
of
character
but
never
offensive
simply
a
great
brew
drinkability
is
good
i
think
i
enjoyed
the
eliot
ness
i
had
earlier
more
but
thats
more
my
personal
preference
drinkability
always
have
this
on
retainer
great
beer
to
give
to
friends
poured
smooth
into
a
pint
glass
pale
honey
colored
with
a
tinge
of
red
light
clean
aroma
after
swirling
glass
deliciously
bready
malt
with
an
nice
hoppy
overtones
not
quite
citrusy
very
smooth
and
drinkable
yet
not
without
a
little
carbonation
on
the
tounge
lingering
lightly
bitter
flavor
very
nice
ahhh
a
golden
ale
without
that
overhopped
citrus
spray
an
even
keel
blend
of
bready
malts
and
hops
and
a
kiss
of
honey
and
faint
citrus
sweetness
that
doesnt
paralyze
or
send
the
tongue
off
into
oblivions
of
taste
but
goes
down
with
an
easy
hit
of
cleanness
i
now
know
what
sylvia
plath
meant
when
she
said
the
snows
of
the
tyrol
the
clear
beer
of
vienna
are
not
very

law
pours
golden
straw
with
an
impressive
yet
diminishing
head
aroma
is
just
okay
in
my
book
very
faint
minerally
aroma
no
hops
present
flavor
is
grassy
and
minerally
well
i
guess
its
balanced
and
to
style
but
i
dont
think
its
my
cup
of
tea
maybe
its
hard
water
or
something
but
its
not
hitting
the
spot
with
me
i
do
get
some
catty
hops
with
the
flavor
but
its
out
of
balance
instead
of
malt
i
get
hops
and
mineral
water
i
will
admit
this
isnt
the
freshest
sample
but
its
not
yet
past
its
best
before
date
perhaps
i
will
seek
out
a
fresher
sample
at
some
point
i
got
this
with
the
great
lakes
sampler
pack
poured
a
very
golden
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
like
the
fact
that
they
stuck
with
the
german
purity
laws
in
this
brew
taste
was
ery
good
i
was
a
little
drunk
when
i
had
this
one
last
night
so
i
wont
go
into
detail
on
the
flavor
mouthfeel
was
virtualy
perfect
with
great
carbonation
to
boot
which
infuenced
the
drinkability
nicely
good
brew
i
poured
this
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint

very
nice
golden

very
drinkable
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
before
stacking
it
up
against
some
of
the
other
dortmunders
i
have
had
expected
a
bit
more

i
have
experienced
in
others
this
is

probably
the
best
lager
ive
had
in
a
long
time
another
winner
from
great
lakes
very
nice
lager
pours
great
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
and
a
great
copper
color
the
smell
is
light
and
satisfying
but
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
taste
the
taste
compliments
the
nose
very
well
with
hints
of
floral
and
a
little
hoppiness
its
very
crisp
and
extremelly
satisfying
like
most
great
lakes
brews
this
one
didnt
disappoint
i
had
this
with
fresh
lake
walleye
and
it
was
just
a
really
great
compliment
all
in
all
this
is
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
lager
try
one
if
you
get
the
chance
the
aroma
mirrors
the
taste
in
that
there
is
a
hint
of
floral
tones
to
it
but
the
beer
also
has
a
very
nicely
balanced
hop
and
malt
taste
the
hops
bring
a
sharpness
to
the
beers
taste
while
the
malt
smooths
out
the
feel
while
the
taste
favors
the
hops
there
malt
serves
as
a
counterbalance
and
due
to
the
floral
influences
plays
off
the
hops
nicely
a
more
bitter
hop
would
just
dominate
and
you
would
lose
the
malt
altogether
here
the
contrast
is
nice
and
it
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
taste
is
great
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
has
the
same
high
ester
profile
followed
by
a
great
hops
bitterness
that
meets
the
sweet
esters
in
the
middle
very
crisp
and
clean
beautiful
aftertaste
this
beer
reminds
me
of
how
much
i
love
a
good
lager
but
there
is
no
way
even
this
beer
can
subtract
from
my
love
of
ale
dont
get
me
wrong
however
i
love
me
a
good
lager
starts
with
big
sweet
fruit
that
moves
into
grassy
biscuits
that
end
on
a
nice
node
of
hay
and
sunshine
crisp
and
clean
and
with
a
distinct
node
of
grass
so
like
most
good
gold
lagers
it
tastes
like
youre
walking
through
a
field
at
sundown
the
beer
arrived
as
an
ambergold
colored
liquid
with
a
onefinger
white
head
the
aroma
is
an
enticing
mix
of
malt
and
hops
both
somewhat
mild
in
intensity
but
well
balanced
the
malt
aroma
is
soft
with
a
slightly
toasted
and
sweetsmelling
quality
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
the
lightlyroasted
malt
and
fleeting
caramel
forming
the
foretaste
the
finish
is
composed
of
a
floral
hop
presence
and
a
solidly
balanced
bitterness
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
very
clean
finish
this
is
a
terrific
and
refreshing
drinking
beer
i
wish
i
had
it
on
the
golf
course
seems
like
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
way
to
introduce
macro
drinkers
to
the
joys
of
craft
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
reddish
copper
color
with
thick
white
head
that
lingered
through
midglass
and
gave
way
to
decent
lacing
aroma
was
mostly
hops
but
i
also
detected
hints
of
honey
and
fruit
possibly
cherry
a
slightly
fruity
spicy
flavor
and
a
very
good
finish
a
most
enjoyable
beer
d
although
this
isnt
the
strongest
lager
ever
its
simple
flavors
and
smooth
carbonation
make
it
excellent
for
drinking
rich
texture
that
makes
this
a
lager
i
would
gladly
reach
for
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
trusted
standbys
i
dont
like
this
style
so
maybe
im
not
being
fair
but
this
one
is
just
kinda
watery
very
thin
bodied
although
drinkable
with
some
odd
aftertaste
couldnt
figure
it
out
hey
there
are
plenty
of
worse
beers
out
there
and
great
lakes
is
a
terrific
brewery
id
just
chose
another
one
another
winner
from
great
lakes
great
malty
character
definitely
worth
a
try
a
nice
drinkable
lighter
beer
opinion
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
i
like
the
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
and
this
beer
passes
itself
off
as
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
malt
is
a
little
raw
in
my
opinion
and
would
likely
benefit
from
a
bit
more
processing
during
the
mash
this
would
probably
help
the
clarity
also
regardless
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
im
going
to
buy
a
few
more
and
try
them
on
a
hot
summer
evening
as
it
seems
it
would
be
particularly
refreshing
overall
plain
and
simple
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
the
crisp
flavors
are
true
to
style
and
the
dry
ending
is
superb
quite
a
good
beer
not
highly
carbonated
but
a
little
more
than
i
would
like
still
not
too
bad
perfect
mouthfeel
an
easy
drinking
balanced
lager
that
would
be
perfect
for
a
bbq
or
football
game
this
is
the
richmans
budweiser
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
medium
redishamber
transparent
with
a
small
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
sweetmalty
and
a
little
bready
taste
umm
what
the
hell
where
did
these
hops
come
from
a
pale
ale
like
hop
quality
is
the
dominant
factor
here
but
the
bready
malts
also
come
through
in
force
making
this
a
full
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
drinkablity
is
just
as
good
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
pale
with
a
better
malt
profile
very
good
beer
d
there
is
a
reason
this
is
sold
everywhere
most
stores
even
the
smallest
gas
stations
and
quick
marts
usually
stock
this
one
next
to
bmc
again
not
my
preference
because
of
price
but
like
tonight
it
was
on
the
way
home
and
i
knew
it
was
quality
drinkability
this
goes
down
very
easy
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
anytime
i
do
see
from
the
ba
style
notes
that
this
one
with
the
dry
tones
and
bitterness
meets
the
style
requirements
a
nice
beer
overall
but
not
as
good
as
i
hoped
seemed
out
of
balance
to
me
as
far
as
i
know
its
the
only
dortmunder
ive
ever
had
so
i
could
be
off
base
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
over
all
a
great
everyday
drinking
beer
maybe
you
could
convert
a
macro
drinker
with
this
one
good
hop
character
with
firm
malty
malts
slightly
spicy
flavor
and
once
again
very
cleanlove
great
lakes
ingredients
the
cleanliness
of
these
beers
makes
the
whole
line
including
this
dortmunder
very
easy
drinking
yet
complex
beers
good
drinkability
but
i
do
wonder
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
without
getting
tired
of
it
tasty
a
full
flavored
lager
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
goose
island
i
dont
have
a
great
lakes
pint
glass
light
golden
borderline
amber
body
that
is
very
clear
lively
carbonation
goes
to
the
top
the
head
was
thick
but
goes
away
within
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
very
grassy
almost
smells
like
fresh
cut
hay
a
little
yeasty
european
bread
smelling
strong
grassy
taste
on
the
tongue
blends
into
a
slight
spiciness
a
dry
nutty
taste
with
a
clean
finish
with
just
the
slightest
hop
spice
lingering
in
the
mouth
it
is
criminal
that
i
cant
get
this
beer
around
here
anymore
i
hate
the
distributor
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
laces
beautifully
the
slight
sweet
aroma
of
amlt
and
then
a
solid
dose
of
hops
comes
in
at
the
end
the
taste
is
excellent
the
malt
flavor
is
strong
and
not
dominated
by
hops
well
balanced
flavor
in
the
mouth
it
feels
heavy
for
a
lager
which
is
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
exceptional
fantastic
flavor
and
crispness
a
great
choice
for
session
beer
i
use
this
beer
on
alot
of
bmc
drinkers
as
an
introduction
to
craft
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
to
take
camping
and
watching
the
campfire
great
lakes
brewerys
first
bottled
beer
and
far
and
away
their
best
seller
poured
from
bottle
into
pilsner
glass
pours
a
glorious
golden
smells
very
malty
balanced
evenly
with
hoppy
spiciness
taste
is
malty
at
first
contact
segues
into
hop
bitterness
as
beer
makes
its
way
to
being
swallowed
mouthfeel
is
typical
lager
fare
easy
drinker
the
balance
of
hops
and
malt
mean
your
mouth
never
gets
overloaded
with
bitterness
or
sweetness
a
classic
from
my
favorite
brewery
appearance
was
clear
gold
poured
with
thick
white
head
pleasing
aroma
of
honey
and
hops
with
a
crisp
green
apple
sweetness
taste
tingly
on
the
tongue
refreshing
smooth
and
refreshing
easy
drinker
first
experience
with
great
lakes
and
i
have
to
say
it
was
a
good
one
d
this
is
an
all
around
great
beer
it
can
be
drank
any
where
any
time
by
anyone
i
think
its
the
best
dortmunder
ive
ever
had
musings
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
for
a
lager
it
is
on
the
top
end
of
the
scale
and
can
compete
with
just
about
anything
out
there
a
little
hard
to
find
and
a
little
expensive
but
a
prime
drinker
picked
up
a
bottle
while
in
madison
wi
best
by
date
of
january
26
2006
is
printed
on
the
label
this
brewery
is
just
awesome
everything
they
do
is
top
notch
all
around
terrific
beer
overall
a
very
impressive
brew
tasted
super
fresh
and
was
refreshing
highly
recommended
as
a
session
choice
this
lager
poured
a
clear
amber
color
with
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
with
modest
hop
bitterness
good
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
feel
the
hoppiness
came
out
in
the
finish
and
lingered
pleasantly
this
was
a
very
nice
crisp
lager
and
was
easy
to
drink
drinkability

hell
yeah
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
any
time
of
year
this
is
what
a
lager
is
supposed
to
be
drinkability
very
drinkable
sessionlike
price5
99
for
a
6
pack
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
and
is
not
full
bodied
it
has
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
much
there
isnt
much
more
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
pretty
average
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
nor
is
there
anything
that
condems
it
depending
on
the
selection
at
the
store
i
would
buy
this
again
however
i
would
only
buy
it
again
if
i
saw
no
better
beer
there
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
is
nothing
that
is
special
about
it
then
again
perhaps
i
am
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
notes
one
of
the
better
glbc
beers
i
had
this
in
a
bottle
and
it
is
even
better
on
tap
drinkability
this
made
an
excellent
choice
for
an
alternative
to
nothing
but
macros
this
is
just
a
litte
better

a
full

at
the
end
very
good
for
the
style
either
my
palate
is
shot
or
i
got
a
bad
example
i
want
to
like
this
and
i
do
like
part
of
it
but
the
first
section
no
thanks
a
reliable
anytime
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
but
this
beer
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
6er
of
this
while
i
was
in
ohio
bracing
bursting
beautiful
beer
so
fresh
if
you
live
in
the
great
lakes
d
this
tastes
like
strong
sweet
corn
and
i
think
i
can
even
taste
the
corn
silk
in
my
teeth
i
would
like
to
see
the
malt
come
through
a
bit
more
or
some
more
hops
to
balance
it
was
to
onedimensional
for
me
however
this
beer
had
an
amazing
longlasting
head
brilliant
golden
colour
topped
by
a
fluffy
white
head
good
lacing
and
retention
makes
this
a
fine
looking
beer
hoppy
aroma
consisting
of
plenty
of
floral
character
and
a
bit
of
lemon
pine
and
spice
this
is
balanced
by
mild
toasty
malt
really
nice
great
combination
of
flavours
toasted
maltiness
moderatetohigh
bitterness
and
generous
hopping
everything
stays
nicely
balanced
right
through
to
the
dryish
finish
with
the
bitterness
lingering
on
even
longer
the
body
is
a
little
fuller
than
light
this
beer
is
quite
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
theres
also
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
that
keeps
it
from
being
overly
dry
great
tasting
and
full
of
flavour
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
lager
well
done
d
for
this
beer
in
this
category
i
would
give
it
a
good
rating
its
a
good
drinkable
beer
at
a
palletable
abv
not
a
bad
release
from
great
lakes
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
untouchable
there
really
isnt
much
more
to
say
about
it
cheers
pours

fantastic
clear

leaving
some
nice

not
a
lot
of

slightly
sweet
and
yeasty
taste
is
very
malty
and
sweet
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
very
good
stuff
with
perhaps
some
honey
and
peach
flavors
coming
through
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
substantial
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
was
at
a
friends
house
and
saw
two
bottles
of
this
in
the
fridge
i
asked
if
i
could
have
one
and
he
said
i
could
but
he
wouldnt
reccomend
it
good
thing
for
me
i
went
against
his
advice
the
smell
was
very
light
and
it
had
me
expecting
an
average
beer
well
the
taste
was
certainly
not
average
slightly
bitter
slightly
sweet
it
was
very
well
balanced
a
nice
satisfying
brew
taste
is
cleandry
and
malty
with
a
wet
grainy
finish
quite
nice
everything
else
seems
to
be
in
check
on
this
one
all
systems
go
overall
a
mostly
typical
golden
craft
lager
with
just
a
little
something
different
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
the
word
that
comes
to
mind
is
grainy
more
than
tasting
malt
you
can
actually
taste
something
like
fresh
grain
in
this
hops
are
light
well
balanced
and
something
id
definitely
like
to
have
again

williamsville
id
have
to
take
an
educated
guess
that
this
is
very
good
example
of
the
dortmund
style
of
export
beers
i
find
it
a
little
too
grainy
to
be
delicious
assertive
hop
presence
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
i
could
drink
these

yet
completely
unpretentious
it
would
be
a
great
pick
for
tailgating
plenty
of
fresh
grain
and
some

the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like

the

about

is
that

while
the

was
having
the

i
took
a
sip
of
hers
in
comparison
and
indeed
its
like
they
doubled
the
normal
dortmunder
gold
recipe
more
hops
more
malt
but
still
quite
good
due
to
the
higher
abv
need
to
stop
at
one
but
easily
could
have
another
a
nice
beer
and
im
glad
they
brought
it
back
to
the
brewery
really

i
really
like
this
beer
overall
im
bummed
i
bought
an
old
4
pack
but
cant
do
nothing
now
besides
drink
it
if
this
was
fresher
it
would
prolly
be
in
the
bs
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
lager
appears
a
hazed
rich
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
yet
quickly
fading
off
white
head
quite
sweet
and
malty
as
well
as
a
bit
fruity
notes
of
toasted
grains
and
bread
apples
and
pears
a
bit
grassy
a
notch
or
two
better
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
not
too
bad
if
you
dig
a
big
sweet
lager
overall
not
a
beer
i
am
too
impressed
with
if
i
am
going
to
be
spending
that
much
money
on
something
like
this
i
will
get
a
12
pk
of
an
adjunct
for
the
same
price
as
the
4
pk
simply
a
letdown
sweet
malt
mixed
with
hops
and
some
alcohol
hops
are
quite
prominent
more
than
one
would
expect
in
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
hot
which
detracts
from
both
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
at
this
strength
this
is
a
sipper
i
doubt
that
i
would
want
more
than
one
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
given
a
choice
i
would
opt
for
the
dortmunder
gold
and
will
the
next
time
im
in
ohio
drinkability
very
nice
its
got
great
flavors
and
is
wonderful
summer
beer
a
bit
more
filling
than
a
standard
export
lager
so
it
would
be
a
bit
heavier
to
attempt
a
couple
and
the
abv
is
just
a
tad
higher
as
well
if
glbc
ever
releases
this
one
again
though
i
will
be
stocking
up
as
it
clearly
lasts
long
past
the
bottling
date
d
pretty
tasty
stuff
wish
i
had
more
than
one
drinks
a
bit
slow
due
to
the
heft
a
nice
night
cap
drinkability
i
thought
this
one
fell
far
short
of
the
original
i
really
dont
care
for
oktoberfest
beers
mush
less
the
style
of
this
one
ill
make
sure
i
stick
to
the
original
and
make
this
a
one
time
only
experience
d
pretty
drinkable
almost
sessionable
but
a
slight
bit
too
much
alcohol
for
that
a
very
enjoyable
beer
none
the
less
drinkability
pretty
decent
beer
would
like
to
dry
again
with
a
fresher
bottle
if
they
continue
to
brew
it
d
exceedingly
drinkable
this
is
some
fantastic
stuff
theyve
made
their
alreadyoutstanding
dortmunder
offering
even
better
a
very
good
beer
it
was
refreshing
and
satisfying
well
balanced
and
good
flavor
an
interesting
experience
but
im
not
sure
its
a
beer
id
rush
back
to
revisit
pours
an
orange
yellow
with
a
small
white
lace
that
disipates
rather
quickly
no
cling
or
carbonation
present
after
the
pour
tastes
of
hops
and
a
good
dose
of
sweet
malt
at
the
end
got
this
in
a
bif
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
style
seems
to
me
to
be
a
solid
brew
that
doesnt
leave
me
with
too
much
to
remember
overall
seems
good
in
all
areas
but
not
great
i
probably
would
not
have
this
again
but
i
would
like
to
try
other
examples
of
this
style
drinkability
what
else
is
left
to
imperialize
i
had
my
doubts
about
this
one
but
rather
enjoyed
it
great
lakes
can
do
no
wrong
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
going
well
with
the
sunshine
this
is
past
its
best
by
date
by
about
5
months
but
so
what
its
damn
good
i
wish
i
had
had
a
fresh
one
to
compare
it
to
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
the
best
by
date
can
be
ignored
on
this
one
this
is
better
than
other
imperial
lagers
excluding
pilsners
i
have
had
st
krampus
and
penn
penndemonium
come
to
mind
by
absolute
leaps
and
bounds
im
extremely
impressed
excellent
truly
outstanding
in
terms
of
balance
and
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
in
a
lager
style
that
i
have
yet
to
come
across
its
simply
the
sort
of
beer
that
you
wish
you
had
more
of
luxurious
and
wellcrafted
but
clean
and
approachable
i
recommend
this
to

and

pear
and
apple
and
some
northern
hops
in
the
background
initial
taste
is
very
sweet
and
malty
with
all
the
cirtus
flavors
coming
through
and
developing
as
it
goes
followed
by
a
nice
balance
of
hopping
and
a
lingering
malt
flavor
very
wellbalanced
and
robust
for
a
lager
medium
body
and
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
another
treat
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
the
mouth
feel
is

with
some
carbonation
the
finish
is

light
and

though
to
me
this
beer
is
one
of
those
why
beers
their
regular
dortmunder
is
really
good
so
why
go
with
the
trend
and
imperialize
it
i
know
its
an
anniversary
beer
but
why
mess
with
the
beer
that
made
you
i
guess
you
have
to
try
new
things
once
in
a
while
its
fun
to
try
this
beer
once
because
nobody
else
will
make
an
imperial
dortmunder
its
kind
of
a
novelty
beer
good
brew
and
a
standout
for
style
drinkability
is

has

contemplated
and
in

decided
it

on

thats

citric

consistent
by
doesnt
go
beyond
its

dimension
feel
is
slick
on
liquid
and
low
on
carbonation
drinkable
yes
if
you
appreciate
the
style
youll
dig
this
d
an
unusual
beer
which
seems
to
have
the
ingredients
to
pay
tribute
to
the
dortmunder
style
yet
also
morphs
into
a
malty
strong
beer
unlike
the
original
in
simplicity
the
complex
malt
textures
are
very
tasty
but
make
this
a
beer
i
would
not
normally
consider
drinkable
but
interesting
and
well
worth
a
try
kudos
to
great
lakes
for
producing
this
unique
lager
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
2
fingers
of
foamy
white
head
nice
retention
yields
some
lacing

of
sweet
caramel
and

floral
and
spicy

hop
finish
with
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
medium
in
body
with
ok
carbonation
sweet
with
some
good
bitterness
but
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
alcohol
dominates
an
ok
brew
but
ill
stick
with
great
lakes
regular
dortmunder
gold
next
time
d
has
the
power
of
an
imperial
but
not
sure
if
a
dortmunder
is
something
i
would
look
for
imperialized
traders
note
special
thanks
to
goryshkewych
for
the
opportunity
overall
this
is
a
great
dortmunder
pours
a
nearly
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
berries
grassy
hops
a
hint
of
diacetyl
pleasant
malt
forward
smell
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
lots
of
fruit
on
the
tongue
lots
of
malt
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
some
grass
in
there
as
well
body
is
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
maybe
a
little
sticky
carbonation
is
crisp
this
is
a
great
malt
forward
brew
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
it
a
bit
fresher
as
i
wonder
if
the
hops
were
more
pronounced
drinkability
is
good
flavorful
and
light
to
bad
it
was
so
expensive
overall
i
am
kinda
ehh
on
this
one
nothing
really
different
going
on
here
and
to
be
honest
i
think
they
could
have
done
better
d
not
bad
but
i
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
mouthfeel
is
sweet
hot
crisp
loads
of
flavor
good
weight
nice
had
a
prickly
carbonation
with
a
dry
and
warming
finish
can
taste
the
alcohol
right
off
very
prominent
also
getting
some
of
usual
lager
flavors
of
corn
and
malt
this
does
have
a
pleasant
bitter
bite
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
very
few
bubbles
rising
through
a
little
flat
drinkability
is
a
little
low
due
to
the
alcohol
smack
good
brew
though
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
could
drink
several
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
while
taking
it
up
a
level
as
implied
by
the
word
imperial
in
the
name
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
lighter
style
of
beer
but
with
a
little
extra
power
to
it
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
might
have
to
check
out
a
few
other
dortmunders
for
comparison
the
body
is
moderate
but
some
under
lining
sweetness
makes
you
think
under
attenuated
hard
to
say
per
base
style
really
though
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
version
of
a
dortmunder
and
even
more
impressive

given
the
choice
between
this
and
a
regular
dortmunder
gold
i
think
i
would
choose
the
regular
dortmunder
d
an
easy
drinking
enjoyable
brew
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
keep
going
back
for
more
of
thanks
to
davideddie
for
the
sample
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
yet
full
flavor
of
malt
that
supports
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
this
is
a
nice
lager
with
malt
and
hop
flavors
big
enough
to
overpower
the
dry
sulfur
punch
at
the
finish
it
was
nice
to
taste
noble
hops

with

from
a
12

pours
a
clear
pale
reddishyellow
with
below
average
carbonation
and
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
sweet
malts
and
mild
piney
hops
first
sip
is
surprisingly
hoppy
with
not
much
else
going
on
a
light
malt
backbone
is
welcomed
some
hoppy
bitterness
is
present
but
on
a
whole
this
is
a
big
disappointment
i
expected
much
more
from
this
beer
when
a
beers
appearance
is
its
strong
point
then
you
normally
have
a
problem
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
grassy
with
hints
of
pear
the
taste
is
a
bit
odd
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
veggies
in
the
front
with
juicy
pilsner
taste
the
beer
is
very
syrupy
and
leads
you
to
believe
that
it
clocks
in
higher
than
7
3
i
can
drink
a
couple
but
it
isnt
something
i
will
seek
out
very
often
i
prefer
the
original
dortmunder
gold
from
great
lakes
it
took
about
six
ounces
for
me
to
appreciate
the
full
brilliance
of
imperial
dortmunder
good
thing
i
have
three
bottles
left
its
extremely
doubtful
that
gl
will
add
this
20th
anniversary
offering
to
their
seasonal
lineup
but
that
wont
stop
me
from
dreaming
about
the
possibility
thanks
to
my
brother
for
buying
and
holding
the
4pack
for
me
though
i
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
its
probably
not
one
ill
be
buying
again
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
starter
one

reduces
to
a
nice

ittle

no

the
aroma
has
a
very
thick

resin
quality
almost
like

on
an
english

the
taste
is
a
lovely

for
a

drinkale
high
abv
beer
this
is
a
tasty
take
on
an
imperial
dortmunder
or
dortmunder
export
it
is
much
bigger
than
i
remember
the
regular
dortmunder
and
almost
seems
on
the
edge
of
oktoberfest

regardless

with
touch

and
a

at

end
the

out

flavor
along
with

doughy
flavors

the

it
finshes
with
a
mild

a
hearty
feel
for
lager
a
tad
chewy

hefty
ar
it
rolls
to
the
back
of
the
palate
there
is
a
slight
warming
feeling
of
alchol
on
the
back
of
the
throat
the
regular
dortmunder
is
favorite
of
mine
this
is
definately
a
ramped
up
version
the
only
real
deterent
is
the
alchol
on
the
throat
but
everything
else
is
strong
so
drink
up
md
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
from
excellent
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
d
a
nice
brew
i
could
easily
have
another
drinkability
this
was
a
ok
beer
just
a
bit
to
sweet
and
heavy
a
great
job
on
going
imperial
without
going
so
far
as
to
leave
no
characteristics
of
the
style
left
overall
this
was
an
interesting
first
tasting
for
this
style
d
good
offering
but
i
think
id
prefer
the
standard
dortmunder
over
this
ampedup
version
i
like
the
crisp
clean
finish
of
a
dortmunder
lager
and
this
didnt
really
deliver
that
d
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
detract
a
bit
from
its
drinkability
but
if
its
something
youre
in
the
mood
for
it
goes
down
nicely
definitely
worth
a
try
d
it
was
great
to
try
this
one
but
i
had
much
higher
expectations
for
it
i
love
dortmunder
gold
and
this
just
isnt
as
good
its
much
sweeter
and
not
as
hoppy
this
has
the
same
flavor
profile
as
most
munich
helles
that
i
have
had
doesnt
seem
very
unique
to
me
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
more
than
i
would
have
expected
some
cloyingness
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
does
get
filling
a
bit
quickly
a
malty
backbone
not
a
hop
lovers
beer
im
kinda
of
in
the
air
about
this
one
maybe
i
just
ezpected
something
more
not
a
bad
beerjust
would
have
expect
more
for
a
20th
anniversary
beer
from
gl
at
least
they
didnt
do
the
overdone
hop
bomb
anniversary
like
most
breweries
do
the
jury
is
still
out
on
this
one
for
me
still
worth
a
tryjust
because
its
different
than
the
rest
pours
a
near
perfect
copper
color
clear
with
one
finger
white
head
no
lacing
and
minimal
retention
smell
is
fine
it
has
a
malty
biscuity
sense
to
it
with
a
bit
of
straw
taste
is
pretty
good
i
though
a
nice
blend
of
strong
malt
backbone
with
some
grassy
hops
and
a
slight
very
slight
alochol
kiss
mouthfeel
was
a
little
heavier
than
i
liked
even
for
an
imperial
this
beer
seemed
to
scream
light
but
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thicker
and
didnt
seem
right
overall
a
good
beer
not
amazing
but
i
would
revisit
this
one
its
good
you
should
try
it
i
got
this
bottle
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
dreally
a
pretty
strong
boozy
afterburn
with
this
there
are
some
fine
qualities
to
this
but
overall
i
much
prefer
the
regular
dort
one
sixer
a
year
of
this
would
be
fine
i
thought
it
would
border
on
maibock
territory
but
it
doesnt
they
actually
did
a
nice
job
of
making
a
bigger
dort
d
i
would
find
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
due
to
its
thickness
and
barrage
of
flavors
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
just
one
i
wouldnt
pay
10
00
a
four
pack
for
any
time
in
the
near
future
id
rather
get
a
good
belgian
drinkability
really
a
very
drinkable
malty
lager
especially
considering
the
alcohol
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
nose
is
sweet
vanilla
taffy
flavor
is
sweet
thick
with
a
viscous
mouthfeel
fairly
malty
with
a
lightly
hoppedbitter
finish
and
very
fullbodied
i
remember
the
regular
great
lakes
dortmunder
gold
as
being
rather
thin
and
weak
however
this
is
very
different
in
its
imperial
state
it
was
unusual
but
i
would
say
i
liked
it
thanks
to
drgonzo3705
for
this
taste
cheers
glowing
orange

bubbly
dirty

is
evenly
spaced
in
delicate
rings
perfect
blend
of
bready
malts
lager
yeast
traits
and
subtle
flowery
hops
on
the
nose
i
love
this
aroma
its
got
some
poundcake
aromas
as
well
without
seeming
overly
sweet
from
the
start
you
can
tell
this
is
one
full
bodied
lager
but
also
carbonated
nicely
and
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
makes
this
incredibly
drinkable
for
such
a
full
bodied
full
flavored
lager
the
etoh
adds
just
a
touch
of
spice
to
the
overall
picture
otherwise
i
get
a
bold
flavored
balance
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
palate
with
the
scale
being
tipped
in
favor
of
the
malt
flavors
it
has
that
similar
bready
crisp
pils
like
malt
base
that
the
original
has
i
like
that
malt
flavor
a
lot
the
hops
add
a
little
flowery
character
and
some
hay
overall
this
is
one
helluva
beer
drinkability
not
great
d
i
could
take
down
a
4pack
easy
dangerously
drinkable
solid
offering
on
my
second
batch
it
proves
to
be
better
than
the
first
by
far
superior
to
dortgold
d
pretty
solid
brew
ill
drink
another
one
for
sure
but
i
think
i
like
the
orginal
better
not
bad
the
only
characteristic
that
really
screamed
imperial
to
me
was
the
body
but
this
packed
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
i
picked
up
a
fourpack
of
this
from
the
gift
shop
on
the
way
out
so
im
looking
forward
to
visiting
this
in
bottle
form
as
well
down
the
line
d
a
decent
beer
and
worth
a
shot
it
really
is
what
is
advertised
imperial
a
sipper
for
sure
d
the
lager
is
moderate
in
strength
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
drinkable
i
wouldnt
power
drink
with
this
but
its
a
good
beer
overall
impression
this
reminds
me
of
a
maibock
or
a
hoppy
pale
bock
i
guess
thats
what
happens
when
you
try
to
step
up
a
dortmunder
a
good
beer
but
kind
of
having
an
identity
crisis
who
cares
what
the
style
is
ill
drink
it
i
could
drink
a
4
pack
of
this
easily
but
not
all
at
once
great
drinking
brew
i
really
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
in
the
flavor
but
it
did
catch
up
to
me
in
the
end
d
before
i
knew
it
i
was
done
with
the
first
and
wondering
to
the
fridge
to
grab
another
at
7
5
this
could
be
hell
of
a
morning
at
the
rate
at
which
they
go
down
drinkability
im
of
the
opinion
that
this
may
be
a
style
that
doesnt
take
well
to
imperializing
that
being
said
ill
probably
prefer
this
to
that
big
1
5l
baltika
9
staring
at
me
drinkability
lacks
the
refreshing
qualities
and
overall
enjoyment
of
its
nonimperial
kin
worth
a
try
i
suppose
but
id
take
a
dortmunder
gold
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
drinkability
one
a
night
is
good
for
me
too
many
of
this
beer
could
leave
you
really
tipsy
maybe
im
just
getting
old
though
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
it
was
a
bit
on
the
hot
side
for
such
a
clean
and
crisp
lager
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
a
bit
more
hop
character
for
something
this
boozy
but
its
still
a
very
nice
interpretation
on
the
style
if
you
enjoy
it
slowly
and
in
moderation
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
it
has
some
tasty
notes
good
mouthfeel
and
looks
nice
in
the
glass
i
think
its
just
a
wee
bit
to
boozy
and
that
cuts
down
on
drinkability
for
me
good
flavor
but
a
little
strong
tasting
in
the
alcohol
department
to
be
greatly
drinkable
md
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
the
drinkability
is
rather
good
for
the
high
abv
imperial
dortmunder
is
a
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
i
would
pick
up
another
4pack
again
if
i
came
across
it
they
just
keep
on
making
impressive
beers
over
there
in
cleveland
d
very
tasty
and
its
a
big
one
to
boot
a
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
but
flavorful
enough
to
savor
tastes
strong
biscuity
malt
nearly
toasty
alcohol
sting
is
present
but
clean
and
not
bearing
hops
not
as
strong
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
but
come
across
as
orange
lemony
and
bright
herbal
hint
of
basil
wet
from
the
malt
hangs
on
the
tongue
allowing
memories
of
the
flavors
to
persist
alcohol
adds
a
sour
and
drying
contribution
thats
really
quite
nice
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
despite
the
extra
alcohol
ummmph
ponderable
mdthick
but
dextrinous
quality
makes
it
come
across
as
thicker
the
moderate
alcohol
cant
pierce
this
and
neither
can
the
md
carbonation
dhad
a
4pk
and
i
would
say
2
tasted
pretty
good
and
2
tasted
just
ok
nothing
really
wrong
with
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
it
is
just
a
bit
too
much
and
seems
to
be
too
far
from
the
dortmunder
style
of
beer
i
just
dont
get
a
dortmunder
essence
any
more
too
much
of
everything
has
turned
this
into
something
else
i
am
not
sure
what
separates
this
from
a
helles
doppelbock
though
it
is
even
on
the
sweet
side
for
some
of
those
certainly
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
flavors
here
it
would
have
fared
a
bit
better
if
labeled
as
a
hells
bock
but
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
end
conclusion
one
beautiful
beer
in
every
visible
way
an
enticing
aroma
a
nice
longlasting
head
that
never
seemed
to
drop
below
a
fourthofaninch
tall
only
hamperedunfortunatelyby
its
taste
if
only
it
were
more
balanced
as
a
craft
beer
this
ones
average
as
a
great
lakes
brew
its
actually
disappointing
yet
it
blows
away
a
lot
of
the
crap
in
the
beer
areas
of
most
stores
and
at
around
10
for
a
four
pack
plus
another
dollar
sales
tax
its
unfortunately
overpriced
but
yet
at
the
same
time
i
still
feel
that
just
having
the
privilege
of
seeing
this
beer
in
action
was
somehow
worth
it
medium
bodied
and
bold
this
beer
is
really
a
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
imperial
is
a
fun
and
applicable
word
here
double
just
wouldnt
do
it
kudos
to
glbc
for
creating
a
new
and
interesting
brew
im
glad
i
got
these
but
will
not
likely
spend
another
ten
bucks
on
a
four
pack
too
many
other
reliable
standbyes
and
new
ones
to
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
certain
slickness
to
it
as
well
almost
making
it
chewy
quite
a
big
lager
here
for
sure
overall
an
interesting
brew
however
i
dont
think
the
dortmunder
style
really
needs
an
imperial
version
glad
i
tried
it
but
ill
be
sticking
to
the
super
tasty
original
very
clean
very
refreshing
and
nothing
like
it
a
tad
cheesy
aroma
dissipitates
in
time
purchased
at
the
new
village
mart
short
lasting
head
light
colour
medium
plus
mouthfeel
drying
aftertaste
very
drinkable
dry
hopping
and
malt
works
for
mer
and
good
with
food
well
done
a
big
version
of
the
classic
when
i
first
saw
this
i
wanted
no
part
of
it
i
was
a
frequent
visitor
of
this
pub
in
its
earliest
days
and
dort
gold
was
the
first
star
this
is
a
nice
tribute
to
the
anniversary
given
todays
style
choices
i
want
to
taste
this
next
to
capital
blonde
dopplebock
d
i
could
drink
this
on
hot
and
cold
days
alike
it
is
smooth
yet
distinctive
especially
if
you
are
used
to
the
dortmunder
gold
from
the
same
brewery
i
only
drop
it
points
as
i
couldnt
justify
spending
so
much
on
a
4
pak
and
the
alcohol
would
be
too
much
for
multiple
bottles
each
day
ultimately
this
is
a
beer
worth
passing
on
as
the
cost
is
way
too
high
compared
to
their
normal
version
if
you
find
it
on
tap
though
it
might
be
a
nice
change
notes
pretty
good
stuff
but
i
like
the
plain
ol
dortmunger
gold
a
lot
more
than
this
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
even
though
this
beer
leaves
me
wanting
just
a
bit
more
i
was
always
going
back
for
another
sip
so
something
must
be
going
right
if
you
are
in
search
of
a
well
crafted
and
well
balanced
lager
look
no
further
if
you
are
looking
for
something
cheap
look
elsewhere

not
really
what
id
expect
its
good
but
not
something
id
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
for
drinkable
yes
for
a
crisp
rich
full
bodied
dort
a
good
job
indeed
the
abv
stays
suttle
as
well
aiding
in
the
drinkability
d
this
one
is
just
plain
odd
and
im
not
sure
if
i
really
like
it
yet
ill
stick
to
the
original
gl
dortmunder
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
rocky
two
finger
white
head
that
remains
for
a
bit
fair
amount
of
stick
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
a
whole
lot
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
sweet
buttered
biscuits
malts
and
some
honey
toasted
grains
and
noble
hops
round
out
the
nose
with
this
one
sweet
bready
malt
up
front
with
an
interesting
spicey
pepper
bite
a
lemon
zest
midway
with
a
touch
of
noticable
booze
as
well
aftertaste
is
some
honey
with
the
lingering
alcohol
burn
feel
is
oily
and
warm
with
a
medium
body
and
a
stinging
carbonation
the
regular
dortmunder
gold
is
a
very
solid
lager
this
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
the
style
i
appreciate
the
attempt
by
glbc
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
too
much
notes
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
picking
up
if
you
find
it
somewhere
the
success
of
dortmunder
gold
both
in
this
reviewers
opinion
and
its
popularity
elsewhere
is
clear
this
stronger
version
loses
the
excellent
balance
of
the
original
and
therefore
suffers
overall
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
with
such
a
high
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
clean
drinks
nicely
not
a
preferred
or
familiar
style
but
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
while
its
available
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
good
ass
the
original
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
nice
anniversary
beer
however
making
the
original
one
bigger
seems
to
take
away
from
it
in
some
ways
still
worth
getting
a
pack
or
two
appearance
compared
to
the
standard
is
pretty
similar
the
head
had
a
toasted
biscuit
hue
versus
the
traditional
dort
gold
being
more
of
an
egg
shell
bright
white
foamy
of
course
head
retention
is
better
here
with
more
malt
and
hops
on
board
lacing
does
indeed
form
thick
and
evenly
with
each
sip
smell
has
a
deep
floral
herbal
grassy
kick
going
down
definitely
some
noble
hops
kicking
the
great
pungent
hop
aroma
is
literally
wrapped
with
honey
drizzled
fresh
baked
biscuits
with
a
touch
of
noticeable
alcohol
that
is
fuckin
awesome
a
bigger
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
lagers
that
still
retains
its
balance
and
original
concept
of
the
little
brother
flavor
wave
rides
heavy
with
cereal
malts
and
deep
honey
sweetness
fresh
baked
split
wheat
toasted
with
honey
and
butter
describes
the
meat
of
the
malt
backbone
hop
profile
doesnt
bash
you
but
you
fully
understand
why
dortmunder
gold
is
such
a
world
class
beer
more
flowery
hops
with
herbal
and
grassy
layers
very
noble
hop
esque
in
general
definitely
worth
the
hype
of
this
very
limited
released
brew
mouthfeel
is
pretty
clean
nothing
heavy
sitting
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
even
very
smooth
7
5
abv
is
barely
noticeable
very
balanced
yet
flavorful
drinkability
is
solid
all
around
something
i
would
down
few
more
of
if
i
had
more
than
a
four
pack
btw
i
picked
this
one
up
in
wintersville
oh
at
valley
wine
cellar
for
8
99
for
four
get
this
limited
brew
while
you
can
d
ill
probably
drink
another
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
goes
down
with
nary
a
remonstrance
from
me
but
the
regular
dortmunder
is
the
superior
beer
lightly
toasted
malt
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
up
front
big
sweet
rummy
fruit
malt
follows
solid
herbal
hop
bitterness
hangs
out
on
the
edge
providing
balance
sweetness
peaks
with
some
caramel
cookie
dough
before
the
herbal
grassy
hop
bitterness
finishes
mediumfull
body
with
a
mouthfeel
that
becomes
almost
syrupy
in
the
finish
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
and
therefore
not
as
drinkable
as
their
regular
dortmunder
but
a
nice
way
to
celebrate
20
years
d
a
great
beer
i
could
enjoy
a
few
in
one
sitting
a
7
5
abv
keeps
this
from
being
a
session
beer
well
if
the
regular
dortmnuder
gold
didnt
qualify
for
export
strength
this
one
surely
does
the
beer
opens
with
a
golden
lightly
amberish
color
like
the
regular
dort
despite
being
described
as
darker
on
the
lable
fair
head
formation
but
falls
to
a
trace
after
a
few
sips
the
aromas
are
deeply
malty
with
hints
of
herbal
hops
moderate
alcohols
and
touches
of
cereal
grains
here
and
there
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
but
taking
on
imperail
pilsner
and
malt
liquor
sweetness
that
prove
a
little
much
for
my
taste
although
the
beer
is
dryhopped
the
presence
of
hops
either
in
the
bittering
or
flavor
offer
little
reprieve
from
the
heavy
maltgrain
flavors
moderately
weighted
with
some
silickness
and
a
slow
alcohol
burn
late
finishes
quite
crisp
for
such
sweetness
i
appreciate
the
attempt
at
a
bigger
beer
of
this
style
but
the
beer
just
doesnt
fullfill
the
quality
that
has
been
already
established
by
the
standard
dortmunder
gold
thanks
to
abankovich
for
the
tif
championship
extra
pours
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
sheen
of
froth
sitting
on
top
of
the
beer
some
hops
in
the
nose
but
the
malt
wins
out
here
im
wanting
to
say
that
im
getting
some
sort
of
fruit
in
the
taste
perhaps
from
the
type
of
hops
being
used
medium
mouthfeel
and
tasty
im
not
a
big
lager
fan
but
this
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
congrats
on
another
astonishing
brew
gl
looking
forward
to
many
more
poured
out
just
like
a
regular
dortmunder
but
seemed
to
be
a
little
bit
thicker
caramel
malts
came
through
on
the
smell
with
a
little
bit
of
breads
taste
is
pretty
medium
bodied
with
the
malts
hitting
you
and
then
the
hops
to
balance
it
hops
are
slighty
grassy
in
taste
very
good
drinkability
in
my
opinion
but
you
have
to
watch
out
for
the
higher
abv
this
would
make
a
great
rotating
release
if
they
werent
just
brewing
it
for
the
anniversary
still
worth
trying
if
youre
in
the
region
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
great
lakesy
im
just
a
little
skeptical
to
the
whole
imperial
term
being
applied
to
all
styles
of
beer
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
copper
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
off
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
bread
yeasts
and
lemon
the
flavor
was
of
bread
citrus
and
pepper
the
body
is
medium
light
and
slightly
creamy
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
pepper
another
nice
beer
from
the
neighbors
to
the
north
d
take
the
awesome
fruitiness
of
the
taste
and
mix
it
with
the
incredible
mouthfeel
and
you
are
left
with
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
great
stuff
i
was
a
little
skeptical
of
the
imperial
dortmunder
style
when
i
heard
about
this
beer
but
im
a
believer
great
lakes
brewed
the
perfect
beer
for
their
20th
anniversary
its
a
classic
representation
of
everything
that
is
great
lakes
straight
forward
damn
tasty
smooth
as
can
be
and
extremely
drinkable
happy
20th
looking
forward
to
many
more
to
come
thicker
than
the
gold
but
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
like
it
maybe
not
enough
to
drop
that
kind
of
money
when
i
can
get
very
close
to
this
very
good
beer
with
the
gold
oh
who
am
i
kidding
ill
buy
more
i
love
glbc
theyre
the
shit
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
at
10
a
4
pack
i
couldnt
drink
it
all
of
the
time
that
would
buy
me
2
5
gallons
of
gas
and
take
me
50
miles
d
great
lakes
is
known
for
extremely
well
rounded
beers
and
its
a
nobrainer
that
their
20th
anniversary
beer
would
be
a
knockout
very
drinkable
for
something
so
full
and
flavorful
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
happy
anniversary
baby
like
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
nice
to
see
this
anniversary
beer
as
a
take
on
their
flagship
brew
i
always
find
the
regular
dortmunder
to
be
a
refreshing
session
beer
this
still
resembles
that
beer
but
takes
some
of
the
drinkability
out
of
it
and
beefs
up
the
body
and
alcohol
i
enjoyed
this
on
tap
a
little
more
than
the
bottle
the
finish
was
a
little
cleaner
and
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
masked
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
dry
beer
on
the
palate
the
beer
has
a
crisp
feel
to
it
this
beer
has
a
great
body
i
want
to
say
that
it
is
mediumheavy
however
the
carbonation
makes
it
hard
to
say
this
carbonation
levels
in
this
brew
toy
with
the
palate
they
make
the
beer
feel
lighter
on
the
palate
than
it
is
when
ignoring
the
carbonation
the
beer
feels
medium
heavy
when
including
it
and
feeling
the
beer
as
a
whole
it
feels
much
lighter
due
to
the
higher
levels
of
carbonation
this
is
one
ill
have
to
pick
up
again
after
all
the
20th
anniversary
only
happens
once
dont
miss
this
beer
very
pale
golden
colornot
a
lot
of
carbonation
or
head
ok
aromamalty
and
grainymild
hop
presence
somewhat
bitter
and
skunk
like
full
and
malty
flavor
nice
heavy
bitter
flavoring
going
on
somewhat
sharp
and
metallic
but
that
has
to
be
between
the
hop
levels
and
a
slight
alcohol
presence
certainly
not
unpleasant
good
full
bodymore
so
then
a
plain
old
dortmunder
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
comes
off
as
a
milder
form
of
some
of
the
super
lagers
you
get
in
europe
nice
beer
d
obviously
not
as
drinkable
as
the
original
but
a
good
and
interesting
pick
for
a
20th
anniversary
im
very
glad
they
didnt
do
the
cliche
ris
or
dipa
though
im
really
looking
forward
to
my
trip
upstate
when
they
release
ba
blackout
again
notes
there
is
no
buttery
taste
like
gls
regular
dort
making
it
better
still
but
again
not
my
thing
na
zdravje
very
nice
beer
literally
tastes
like
they
just
doubled
everything
creamy
in
the
mouth
showing
a
drawn
out
finish
that
lager
refreshment
on
the
end
with
a
warming
alcohol
and
prickly
carbonation
honey
dew
sap
breads
biscuit
bitter
on
the
end
with
piney
almost
herbal
hops
a
good
beer
however
i
think
the
regular
dortmunder
is
more
well
rounded
why
double
it
wow
it
was
worth
the
wait
the
appearance
is
a
lovely
dark
yellow
light
orange
hue
the
smell
was
of
a
very
strong
alcohol
presence
truthfully
a
little
off
putting
then
you
drink
it
lovely
sweet
malty
tones
make
this
beer
start
and
finish
well
it
has
been
a
half
hour
since
my
last
drink
and
i
still
can
taste
the
lovely
sweet
finish
on
my
lips
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
at
7
5
abv
can
be
trouble
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
great
lakes
brew
and
i
hope
it
is
not
a
one
time
thing
excellent
beer
is
it
a
dortmunder
an
imperial
dortmunder
what
is
an
imperial
dortmunder
who
cares
this
a
just
a
damn
fine
brew
eric
feels
smooth
and
creamy
and
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
borders
on
dangerous
at
7
5
abv
a
beer
that
goes
down
this
easy
is
easy
to
underestimate
im
not
even
sure
what
imperial
dortmunder
really
means
but
to
the
brewery
it
means
more
malts
and
abv
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
this
brew
rocks
it
poors
a
pretty
amber
color
average
to
above
average
smell
for
a
lager
but
the
taste
is
so
smooth
and
refreshing
the
brewery
was
a
buzz
about
this
beer
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
please
do
you
will
not
be
dissappointed
ontap
at
city
beer
store
sf
the
appearance
was
a
normal
lager
light
orangebrown
and
see
through
the
nose
is
what
first
got
me
while
you
get
the
typical
bready
lager
there
was
a
noticeable
hint
of
citrus
and
lemon
it
wasnt
until
i
tasted
it
that
i
realized
what
i
was
in
for
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
lager
the
hop
flavor
is
stronger
than
any
other
lager
ive
had
but
it
is
not
bitter
at
all
which
makes
it
so
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
moonlight
offering
and
ive
loved
a
few
of
them
very
happy
to
have
access
to
all
of
these
perfect
representation
of
the
style
per
bjcp
guidelines
does
not
merit
perfect
score
due
to
slight
chill
haze
interesting
vanilla
aroma
is
very
welcome
as
far
as
taste
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
of
balance
with
the
slightest
hop
presence
to
subdue
a
pleasant
cereal
sweetness
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
medium
light
overall
wonderful
overall
a
great
lager
lager
usually
isnt
my
go
to
style
but
it
is
beer
like
this
which
proves
what
is
best
in
the
style
really
one
of
the
better
lagers
i
can
recall
having
in
some
time
not
bad
at
all
d
super
drinkable
very
well
balanced
and
very
refreshing
while
still
being
fully
flavored
and
retaining
body
the
spiced
beer
from
moonlight
are
in
the
love
it
or
hate
it
realm
but
the
traditional
styles
that
moonlight
makes
should
have
appeal
for
plenty
lunatic
lager
is
certainly
feeling
the
love
from
this
ba
feel
is
very
clean
and
crisp
the
way
it
should
be
malts
are
present
in
the
beer
but
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
fruity
body
that
makes
you
feel
like
there
isnt
drinkability
is
great
as
the
beer
never
gets
too
bitter
has
plenty
of
juicy
fruit
and
remains
lively
and
excited
from
the
decent
carbonation
for
the
entire
beer
cant
wait
to
get
more
moonlight
beers
after
this
overall
an
absolutely
killer
pale
lager
wish
they
were
all
this
good
a
great
session
beer
and
at
4
1
nobody
in
the
world
except
one
or
two
crazy
brits
i
know
would
deny
that
this
is
a
session
beer
a
bit
dull
and
rather
dry
but
then
this
isnt
the
most
exciting
style
serving
type
ontap
the
taste
has
a
subtle
spice
with
notes
of
lemon
a
touch
of
bread
and
an
upper
level
of
low
bitterness
notes
of
lemon
are
prominent
the
finish
is
crisp
light
and
clean
the
beer
has
a
high
moderate
level
of
draft
carbonation
and
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
d
this
is
what
macros
should
taste
like
but
dont
a
touch
bloaty
after
a
while
but
otherwise
a
superb
summer
afternoonlawnmower
beer
overall
what
can
i
say
i
have
only
ever
had
two
offerings
from
moonlight
and
both
have
been
fantastic
if
i
can
ever
get
myself
out
there
i
am
thinking
it
would
make
for
a
very
enjoyable
time
d
this
is
going
to
be
my
next
keg
imperial
pint
at
jupiter
in
berkeley
on
my
second
visit
during
my
northern
california
trip

from

finish

this

down

overall
mouthfeel
is

very
light
thin

tons
of

could
drink
a
few
more
of
these
with
no
problem
super
light
on
the
stomach
always
willing
to
try
a
new
moonlight
brews
and
i
would
drink
this
one
again
would
be
a
good
beer
in
the
warmer
months
recommended
the
taste
is
malty
yeasty
and
bready
with
toasted
cracker
a
hint
of
nutty
grain
with
a
pronounced
but
smooth
piney
hop
taste
and
bitterness
steadily
developing
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
give
a
crisp
bittersweet
finish
and
a
long
nice
nuttygraintoasted
cracker
aftertaste
it
is
refreshing
and
crisp
but
flavourful
with
some
complexity
and
nicely
balanced

bready
with
some

a
touch
of

with

kinda
of

an
overhopped
boston
lager
great
balance
perfect
carbonation
semidry
finish
excellent

poured
as
an
imperial
pint
at
barclays
in

the
glass
was
filled

the
rim
so
little
to
no
head
to
judge
beautiful
slightly
hazy
orangishgolden
color
the
aromas
are
relatively
light
at
first
but
develop
as
the
beer
warms
into
orange
and
tangerine
citrus
a
touch
of
grapefruit
and
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
really
nice
some
wonderfful
orange
and
grapefruit
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
smooth
lager
yeast
tanginess
and
a
hint
of
cherry
followed
by
a
surprising
bitter
tinge
of
earthyspicy
hops
at
the
finish
if
all
american
allmalt
lagers
were
like
this
id
drink
them
all
the
time
the
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
until
the
bitter
hops
kick
in
and
lend
a
refreshing
snap
to
the
beer
just
delicious
and
a
real
eyeopener
as
to
what
the
style
can
be
ive
been
drinking
moonlight
beers
for
at
least
1516
years
whenever
i
can
find
them
i
really
think
this
stuff
is
some
of
the
best
crafted
freshest
beer
you
can
find
and
their
beers
are
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
in
the
bay
area
and
have
a
chance
to
drink
some
dont
passs
it
up
for
more
sought
after
beers
most
people
dont
even
know
many
of
their
beers
exist
and
of
what
quality
they
are
another
just
fantastic
brew
clear
pale
gold
with
a
small
cap
of
foam
on
top
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
fresh
and
floral
with
a
bit
of
cut
grass
and
some
toasty
malts
the
taste
is
richly
malty
before
giving
way
to
the
dry
hoppy
finish
lots
of
hops
in
this
lager
lending
it
a
signature
west
coast
character
the
light
body
and
ample
carbonation
make
this
one
seriously
refreshing
and
sessionable
beer
its
a
shame
this
stuff
doesnt
come
in
6
packs
seems
to
be
just
how
id
like
a
lager
to
be
perfectly
served
at
flavor
light
gold
with
a
dense
fluffy
white
head
totally
clear
and
bright
brilliant
even
aromas
of
dense
malts
juciy
fruits
and
bitter
german
hops
taste
is
fresh
and
hoppy
with
a
great
malt
back
bone
that
provides
the
drinker
with
many
complex
flavor
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
but
substantial
enough
to
hold
it
all
together
and
provide
and
excellent
drinkability
not
the
best
killer
beer
from
this
brewery
but
still
freakin
great
light
gold
color
medium
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
a
touch
fruity
a
medium
bodied
lager
malts
are
mild
a
touch
fruity
hops
are
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
nicely
balanced
slightly
more
flavor
than
i
expected
from
a
lager
smooth
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
not
sure
if
it
supposed
to
be
there
or
not
but
it
makes
it
a
little
more
interesting
malt
goes
along
with
leather
and
tobacco
becomes
a
little
sweeter
as
taste
lingers
on
the
palate
toffeish
then
gets
rolled
over
by
a
very
livley
metallic
carbonation
a
soft
touch
of
yeast
adds
smoothness
to
the
mouthfeel
while
barley
and
hops
carry
a
zingy
freshness
a
good
example
of
how
a
decent
lager
should
be
lovely
malty
taste
smooth
finish
lovely
bouquet
at
5
3
it
is
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
many
dishes
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
rather
than
quaff
i
enjoyed
one
i
found
the
second
a
little
bitter
to
the
taste
i
have
only
limited
experience
of
swedish
beers
but
this
tempts
me
to
experiment
further
as
the
intensity
of
the
flavours
is
very
much
to
my
palate
mo
to
be
honest
it
is
less
carbonated
than
desirable
but
fortunately
the
body
is
not
heavy
at
all
and
the
flavour
profile
is
generally
moderate
and
quite
simplistic
all
in
all
an
easy
drinking
dortmunder
lager
but
i
would
personally
expect
a
bit
bolder
hop
and
richer
malt
presence
not
a
great
one
really
surprisingly
considering
the
name
but
still
ok
basic
dortmunder
style
but
a
step
up
from
a
cheap
pale
lager
anyway
so
thats
something
o
a
better
lager
it
should
be
at
18
90
sek
à
330
ml
its
not
for
binge
drinking
but
its
a
great
match
with
most
classic
swedish
foods
a
good
alternative
to
both
ales
and
lagers
o
one
of
the
best
and
most
original
lagers
ive
had
very
different
take
on
a
german
style
and
i
would
dare
say
outdoes
the
german
varieties
skip
and
move
on
in
sweden
nothing
worth
trying
here
a
nice
well
balanced
lager
pours
a
nice
amber
gold
colored
flavor
is
kind
of
thickly
sweet
and
malty
borders
on
sickly
sweet
but
doesnt
quite
get
there
seems
like
its
a
just
barely
thing
the
thick
sweetness
is
probably
masking
any
other
potential
characteristics
from
showing
well
its
okay
but
too
fuzzy
and
lacking
sharp
definition
this
has
a
good
feel
to
it
plenty
of
body
for
a
lager
be
it
a
dort
or
an
export
and
enough
flavours
to
make
it
stand
out
from
the
crowd
a
very
good
lager
d
this
isnt
my
favourite
beer
style
nice
but
nothing
special
overall
this
swedish
lager
was
a
nice
surprise
wellbalanced
it
results
in
a
crisp
and
refreshing
lager
with
a
marked
personality
and
a
nice
malt
character
without
forgetting
its
hoppy
strengths
great
simple
stuff
d
a
good
lager
way
better
than
the
standard
euro
lagers
usually
found
in
sweden
not
bad
at
all
very
sessionable
spicepepperacidity
could
get
old
after
a
few
though
pretty
sure
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
but
i
would
drink
it
again
especially
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
nice
clean
tasting
lager
good
for
drinking
when
youre
not
after
a
lot
of
big
taste
but
you
still
want
something
way
better
than
the
biggest
commercial
beers
a
nice
and
well
done
dortmund
lager
with
a
fine
palette
very
tasty
indeed
much
more
complex
than
most
other
swedish
crap
lagers
hoppy
and
with
the
bitterness
that
comes
together
with
it
this
is
one
of
the
better
swedish
lager
ive
drunk
id
recommend
everyone
to
try
this
if
they
have
the
chance
a
good
lager
malty
and
hoppy
slightly
spicy
lightish
slightly
resiny
at
times
it
came
across
as
a
bit
soggy
or
sticky
or
something
still
very
nice
bittersweet
flavour
i
kind
of
liked
it
serving
type
bottle
this
one
is
a
pretty
steady
lager
a
bit
earthy
but
thats
okay
it
gives
it
some
spunk
and
character
lagers
seem
to
be
so
one
dimensional
or
uninteresting
but
this
one
is
certainly
not
that
nice
body
nice
width
of
a
flavor
profile
i
can
dig
it
a
pretty
uninteresting
beer
not
actively
bad
tasting
but
pretty
much
a
liquid
yawn
drank
in
memoriam
of
randy
macho
man
savage
near
lake
shasta
dig
it
nothing
mellow
about
this
more
of
a
chalky
and
severe
style
an
odd
murkiness
that
does
not
do
much
for
drinkability
more
of
a
funikfied
belgian
hint
to
it
than
a
usual
german
kind
of
beer
picked
this
up
solely
because
it
said
is
was
100
vegan
but
overall
average
this
was
drinkable
based
on
the
style
slightly
spicey
bitterness
that
just
dominates
by
the
finish
and
lingers
lightly
like
lemon
zest
